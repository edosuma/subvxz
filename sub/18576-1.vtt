00:43.377 --> 00:45.001
Somebody's coming, Ben.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.249
Yeah, how many?

00:46.338 --> 00:48.331
Don't know, couldn't tell.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.664
Just one.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.595
I think i know him.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.748
Hello, J.D.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.037
Ben.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.495
How've you been?

02:07.586 --> 02:08.701
So-so.

02:10.714 --> 02:11.829
You?

02:12.382 --> 02:13.960
Can't complain.

02:18.222 --> 02:21.721
You with them, Lightfoot,
or just passing through?

02:22.768 --> 02:26.219
If i told you once, J.D.,
I've told you a dozen times.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.223
My name is Chief Lightfoot.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.233
And i'm a bona fide war chief
of the Comanche nation.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.105
- And you and l...
- You didn't answer my question.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.738
I'll make it plain.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.029
Do i have to shoot you or not?

02:38.116 --> 02:40.239
Stopped by for a cup of coffee.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.245
Very good cup.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.281
You figure i owe you anything, Ben?

02:45.374 --> 02:46.488
Nope.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.603
I got a warrant for the three of you and...

03:08.772 --> 03:10.350
Pee Wee Simser.

03:11.316 --> 03:14.732
- That's you over at the left, Pee Wee?
- That's right, J.D.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.362
That's me.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.356
And Joe Meehan,i see you.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.783
Any of you want to surrender?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.367
Now, what did you say?

03:27.457 --> 03:30.162
I said, "Any of you want to surrender?"

03:32.921 --> 03:34.997
Five of us and one of you?

03:37.509 --> 03:39.881
I'll say one thing for you, J.D.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.137
You got style.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.589
Yes, sir, you got style.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.316
Oh, no, you ain't.

05:25.033 --> 05:29.078
You ain't gonna get me today,
you dirty, beady-eyed little sons.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.863
Little Pee Wee ain't gonna die today,
you filthy scavengers.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.867
Oh, shut up, Simser.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.295
Buzzard bites you,
he'd never eat meat again.

05:57.774 --> 05:58.854
J.D.?

06:08.660 --> 06:11.745
I can hear. You don't have to shout.
What do you want?

06:11.830 --> 06:15.080
J.D., i'm suffering the tortures
of the damned back here.

06:15.167 --> 06:19.330
- Now, my leg is killing me. Can't we just...
- Don't start crybabying, Pee Wee.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.457
I know the sound
of that old Spencer of yours.

06:22.925 --> 06:26.091
You put a slug in the meaty part
of my left shoulder.

06:26.178 --> 06:29.547
You knowed damn well
I've been shot there twice before.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.295
You knowed.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.049
Damn it, J.D.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.544
These things is too tight.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.885
There ain't no reason to chain us up
like a bunch of dogs.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.051
Meehan!

07:16.061 --> 07:17.686
Dad-blast it, J.D.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.642
You ain't gonna sleep
with that Greener on cock, are you?

07:20.732 --> 07:22.191
That's right.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.571
If you even twitch your finger by accident,
you could blow our heads off.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.407
If you call the tune, you pay the piper.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.775
Meaning, if you don't like the treatment...

07:32.870 --> 07:34.661
don't rob the banks.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.598
Billy Joe!

08:03.025 --> 08:04.685
Billy Joe Cahill!

08:05.527 --> 08:07.069
Coming, Denver!

08:07.154 --> 08:08.945
Make it mighty damn pronto.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.023
It's time you was in bed.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.384
There you are.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.251
I don't know
what's got into you boys lately.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.260
This morning i sent your brother
into town with Struther...

08:36.350 --> 08:39.553
and he ain't back yet.
Now i can't get you to go to bed.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.885
- I'm going.
- Damn right you are.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.809
This is the last trip that Danny makes
with that Struther.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.308
I told your pa it was a mistake to hire him.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.312
Would the marshal listen to me? No.

08:49.404 --> 08:52.441
He rides off and leaves me
with everything to worry about.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.695
Denver?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.943
I'm awful tired. Can i go to bed now?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.159
Sooner the better. Get plenty of rest...

08:58.247 --> 09:01.331
cause we got a lot of darn work
to do tomorrow.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.722
All right, the plates.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.355
Whoa, boy.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.779
Giddyup!

11:10.837 --> 11:12.462
Get out of here.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.827
That's all right.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.673
Mr. Grady.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.344
Can you spare one of them cigars?

12:08.187 --> 12:10.594
Pay you back as soon as I get out.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.683
How old are you, boy?

12:12.774 --> 12:14.185
Seventeen...

12:14.860 --> 12:16.319
going on 18.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.611
Is that right, Struther?

12:18.697 --> 12:20.488
He was 17 last week.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.368
But he's a man full-grown, if you ask me.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.112
And capable of making up
his own mind about...

12:27.205 --> 12:28.949
cigars or whatever.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.499
Ain't that right, Danny?

12:30.584 --> 12:32.375
Yes, sir, you betcha.

12:33.712 --> 12:37.046
His old man is gonna kick you
from here to California...

12:37.132 --> 12:40.252
when he finds out how you've been
watching out over his boy.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.965
I told you he was a man.
We're friends, is all.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.882
I ain't watching over him.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.551
Well, you should be.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.845
I knew J.D. was wrong
when he took custody of you.

12:50.229 --> 12:53.562
Promised the judge
you'd never use that knife again.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.733
- You're nothing but a two-bit little...
- Sheriff?

12:57.569 --> 13:01.318
Jimmy Kane's bringing in Charlie Smith,
and drunk as usual.

13:07.246 --> 13:10.615
What's wrong, Charlie?
You're not due here till Thursday next.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.202
I don't know.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.455
Sheriff, the Devil called...

13:17.506 --> 13:19.249
And i come running.

13:19.341 --> 13:22.508
Fire in the Simpson stable, Sheriff!

13:22.594 --> 13:25.595
- God Almighty. That place will go up...
- I'm coming, Sheriff!

13:25.681 --> 13:28.053
No, you're not.
You'd fall asleep and get roasted.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.134
Now get in your cell!

13:31.478 --> 13:32.854
Fire!

13:43.156 --> 13:45.066
Sure get excited about...

13:45.158 --> 13:46.653
a little fire.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.780
That's what we've heard.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.997
Come on, she's burning fast!

13:54.084 --> 13:55.495
Pull harder!

13:57.462 --> 13:58.873
All right. Get her moving.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.625
Don't i know you, boy?

14:03.051 --> 14:05.044
Danny Cahill, Mr. Smith.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.049
J.D. 's boy?

14:08.807 --> 14:10.088
Yes, sir.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.301
I don't want to be inquisitive...

14:14.563 --> 14:16.805
but what are you in here for?

14:17.649 --> 14:19.476
Drunk and disorderly.

14:22.196 --> 14:24.521
I heard about it. Yeah.

14:25.282 --> 14:28.733
You busted up the Liberty Saloon
real good.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.950
Did $37 damage.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.331
Your pa's knowed around some, ain't he?

14:44.468 --> 14:48.762
I reckon he's been knowed around
a few campfires and public hangings.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.518
That old worn-out drunk
sure puts rust on the blade for us.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.767
He could swallow his tongue.

15:04.863 --> 15:05.894
What?

15:05.989 --> 15:07.816
A lot of boozers I've knowed...

15:07.908 --> 15:10.825
just kinda swallowed their tongue
and never woke up.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.747
I can put a pillow over the dog's head
and smother him.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.036
Fraser!

15:19.044 --> 15:20.159
What you talking about?

15:20.254 --> 15:22.542
We said nobody would get hurt,
and nobody is.

15:22.631 --> 15:26.166
That old coot ain't even gonna wake up
until outhouse call in the morning.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.003
Yeah, that's right.

15:28.637 --> 15:33.050
Danny, it's gonna take more than
old Charlie there to mess up our plans.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.852
Give them to me.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.944
Denver's madder than hell, Danny.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.899
I'm thinking we oughta change our minds
while we still can.

16:29.990 --> 16:33.441
Now, Billy Joe,
that just ain't no Christian attitude...

16:34.369 --> 16:36.279
That's your privilege.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.619
Plain fact is that you're both...

16:38.707 --> 16:39.870
young.

16:39.958 --> 16:43.742
If you're gonna go backwatering on me,
I ain't going to hold it against you.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.794
He's flimflamming us, Danny.

16:45.881 --> 16:48.633
He thinks that being young
is the same as being stupid.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.425
You go whichever way you want...

16:50.510 --> 16:53.714
but that barn out there
ain't gonna burn forever.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.304
Give him the keys, Billy Joe.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.850
Kinda hate to set ourselves against Pa.

17:00.938 --> 17:02.052
Pa?

17:02.147 --> 17:05.730
That cranky old cowhand Denver
has been more of a pa to you than J.D.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.810
Ain't that right, Danny?

17:10.614 --> 17:12.653
The hell with J.D. Cahill.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.992
Let's go rob ourselves a bank, Billy Joe.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.405
Give me the keys.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.006
Struther!

17:54.074 --> 17:56.909
Come on!

17:59.788 --> 18:02.160
Move it. Watch what you're doing!

18:02.249 --> 18:04.242
Move that bucket.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.580
Pump faster!

18:07.963 --> 18:10.501
Get that water on the roof!

18:37.284 --> 18:38.778
Now get at it!

18:53.383 --> 18:54.961
All right, move.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.838
Throw the water!

18:57.137 --> 19:00.636
Come on. Get it over where the fire is!
A little bit lower.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.468
Keep pumping there!

19:20.452 --> 19:21.733
Sheriff!

19:22.329 --> 19:23.823
Come on, now!

19:23.914 --> 19:25.657
- The bank's being robbed.
- What?

19:25.749 --> 19:28.418
The bank's being robbed.

19:28.502 --> 19:29.782
Sheriff!

19:30.128 --> 19:33.462
Gordine, stay on the fire. Jim, the bank.

19:34.967 --> 19:36.793
Get on the pumps. Go!

19:38.887 --> 19:41.046
All right, pour it on there!

19:41.181 --> 19:43.470
Get water on that roof there!

19:51.942 --> 19:54.813
- Remember, nobody's to get hurt!
- Get back.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.531
Sheriff!

20:05.289 --> 20:06.866
Sheriff Grady.

20:09.710 --> 20:10.955
Come on.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.215
Oh, Danny.

20:42.868 --> 20:44.066
All right.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.828
Get on inside.

20:46.455 --> 20:47.735
Not you!

20:48.916 --> 20:50.742
Now, where's that boy?

21:06.767 --> 21:08.427
I seen it, Danny.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.226
I seen them both killed.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.601
There's nothing i could do. I tried.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.062
- Boy, you listen to me!
- Hey!

21:16.902 --> 21:19.144
You do what you're supposed to do.

21:19.238 --> 21:22.357
You hide that money just like we agreed,
and you just wait.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.821
That's all you do. You just wait...

21:24.910 --> 21:28.575
if you ever want to see your big brother
alive again. Do you understand me?

21:28.664 --> 21:30.573
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.658
And you, you listen, too.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.205
You betray us...

21:34.294 --> 21:38.126
You betray us even with a look,
and as sure as there's a Devil in Hell...

21:38.215 --> 21:41.251
either me, or Brownie, or Struther,
or one of our friends...

21:41.343 --> 21:44.297
of which there are many, will kill that boy.

21:44.847 --> 21:46.839
We know what to do with betrayers...

21:46.932 --> 21:48.971
and we'll kill him for sure.

21:49.101 --> 21:50.512
You hear me?

21:53.605 --> 21:54.803
Say it!

21:55.399 --> 21:56.644
I hear!

21:56.817 --> 21:58.359
Now get inside!

23:18.065 --> 23:19.475
- Marshal.
- Albert.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.318
- I sure am glad you're back.
- I'm glad to be back.

23:22.402 --> 23:26.614
There's three more of them in there.
One of them needs Dr. Jones real bad.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.409
I'd appreciate it if you'd see to him
and the horses.

23:29.493 --> 23:32.447
- Yes, sir. Marshal, I wanted to...
- And Tom Howard.

23:32.538 --> 23:35.657
- The undertaker?
- I got a couple of customers for him, too.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.291
But, Marshal, i wanted to...

23:37.376 --> 23:39.783
Tell that old bandit not to get extravagant.

23:39.962 --> 23:41.871
The State of Texas is paying for this.

23:41.964 --> 23:43.458
Yes, but, Marshal...

23:43.549 --> 23:45.921
Albert, have you heard one word i've said?

23:46.009 --> 23:48.631
Yes, but I wanted to tell you
about Sheriff Grady.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.555
- Tell me later.
- But you haven't...

24:07.447 --> 24:09.107
It's the marshal.

24:27.676 --> 24:28.791
Hank?

24:33.849 --> 24:35.676
No way to run a jail.

24:37.102 --> 24:38.300
Be my guest.

24:38.395 --> 24:41.562
- J.D., these handcuffs...
- Get used to them.

24:47.571 --> 24:48.946
Charlie...

24:49.823 --> 24:52.528
what are you doing in here?
It ain't Thursday.

24:52.618 --> 24:55.322
A man's got a right to change his mind.

24:55.495 --> 24:58.117
Besides, it's gonna rain on Thursday.

24:58.207 --> 25:00.199
Now, drinking in the rain...

25:01.084 --> 25:03.326
it's bad for your health.

25:05.047 --> 25:07.834
It's getting so a man
can't get a decent night's sleep...

25:07.925 --> 25:10.048
without some marshal...

25:10.135 --> 25:14.003
All right, Struther, you can come out
from under that Stetson.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.508
What is it this time?

25:15.599 --> 25:17.971
Hope you haven't been stealing
any more horses...

25:18.060 --> 25:20.681
No, J.D., i'm hung over something terrible.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.810
I can't hardly remember a thing.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.357
You can't...

25:28.862 --> 25:30.107
Daniel?

25:30.197 --> 25:31.395
Daniel.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.739
What the hell is he doing in here?

25:35.828 --> 25:39.161
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Yeah! Drinking and fighting.

25:39.873 --> 25:41.202
With them.

25:45.295 --> 25:48.047
Looks like you were kind of overmatched.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.337
It was a friendly fight.

25:55.931 --> 25:58.089
I've never been in one of them.

25:59.434 --> 26:01.890
What are you doing in town, you...

26:02.062 --> 26:03.853
Come here.

26:11.405 --> 26:13.481
All right. I know where you are.

26:13.574 --> 26:15.400
Where's your kid brother?

26:15.492 --> 26:16.903
He's around.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.150
Around?

26:18.245 --> 26:20.238
Isn't he going to school?

26:20.414 --> 26:22.620
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes?

26:23.583 --> 26:27.451
How's he gonna get a proper education
going to school "sometimes"?

26:27.546 --> 26:30.997
Instead of raising Ned, you ought
to be raising that brother of yours.

26:31.091 --> 26:33.926
Ain't you got no sense of responsibility?

26:34.261 --> 26:36.467
Your mother, God rest her soul...

26:36.555 --> 26:39.176
seen to it you could read and write...

26:39.266 --> 26:41.093
could do your ciphers proper.

26:41.184 --> 26:43.936
The least you could do
is the same for your kid brother.

26:44.021 --> 26:45.052
Why?

26:45.147 --> 26:46.226
Why?

26:46.940 --> 26:48.482
I ain't his pa.

26:56.158 --> 26:56.904
Yeah.

27:02.873 --> 27:04.747
Marshal, you should have seen...

27:04.833 --> 27:06.292
You're fired.

27:09.546 --> 27:10.921
Billy Joe.

27:11.215 --> 27:12.839
Where you going?

27:14.885 --> 27:16.260
Come here.

27:23.644 --> 27:25.138
Hello, Budger.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.226
Hello, Pa.

27:32.319 --> 27:34.193
You're bleeding again.

27:35.113 --> 27:36.145
Yeah.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.861
Seems like every time you show up,
you been bleeding.

27:38.951 --> 27:40.065
Yeah.

27:40.661 --> 27:45.287
Only sometimes it's hard to remember
when the last time you showed up was.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.825
I'll admit it's been a while.

27:50.254 --> 27:51.333
J.D.

27:52.339 --> 27:54.497
Hello, Hank. You have a good rest?

27:54.591 --> 27:56.085
Where did you come from?

27:56.176 --> 27:58.133
Where the hell is Grady?

27:58.762 --> 28:01.087
What's the matter?
Did i say something wrong?

28:01.974 --> 28:06.054
Come on, Hank, if Grady's drunk,
it won't be the first time.

28:06.687 --> 28:08.726
Grady's been killed, J.D.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.766
For the first time.

28:30.878 --> 28:33.547
Marshal, good to see you, but I...

28:33.630 --> 28:34.875
Any luck?

28:34.965 --> 28:36.210
No, sir.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.672
I brought you a couple of guests.

28:38.760 --> 28:42.592
The sheriff from Dawson City
will pick them up in a day or so.

28:43.557 --> 28:47.092
I'm awfully sorry about Sheriff Grady.
I know he was a friend of yours.

28:47.185 --> 28:48.300
Yeah.

28:49.396 --> 28:51.021
I'm not gonna...

28:51.398 --> 28:52.940
mourn for him.

28:54.318 --> 28:56.144
He lived a good life.

28:57.696 --> 29:00.448
Guess there's no good way to die, so...

29:05.704 --> 29:07.246
Tell me what happened.

29:07.331 --> 29:08.741
Pretty sketchy.

29:08.832 --> 29:12.664
All Kane said before he died was,
"Four men wearing yellow slickers."

29:13.504 --> 29:17.204
Grady got shotgunned,
and I pulled a knife out of Jim Kane.

29:17.299 --> 29:20.170
They broke in the back door of the bank
with sledgehammers.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.336
We rode a 30-mile circumference...

29:22.429 --> 29:24.801
with a 20-man posse,
including two Apaches.

29:24.890 --> 29:26.052
No tracks.

29:26.141 --> 29:29.261
That's impossible,
unless they're still in town.

29:29.353 --> 29:31.511
No, sir, Mr. Cahill. No strangers.

29:31.605 --> 29:33.930
Some local ranchers, some cowboys...

29:34.024 --> 29:37.393
maybe not as sweet as scrubbed angels...

29:37.527 --> 29:40.612
but in public view when it happened,
no strangers.

29:41.949 --> 29:43.491
How about them?

29:43.575 --> 29:45.817
They was in jail when it happened.

29:45.911 --> 29:47.654
That right, Daniel?

29:49.289 --> 29:50.783
That's right.

29:52.668 --> 29:53.782
Pity.

29:56.964 --> 29:59.122
Mr. Gordine,
when will you let us out of here?

29:59.216 --> 30:01.623
Drunk and disorderly
is usually about 24 hours.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.592
I guess now is a good a time as any.

30:03.679 --> 30:06.051
I'm gonna make a little trip.
Take a day or two.

30:06.140 --> 30:08.013
Will you hold them till I get back?

30:08.100 --> 30:10.139
I can't do that, Marshal.

30:10.227 --> 30:11.507
No cause.

30:12.271 --> 30:13.469
Suit yourself.

30:13.564 --> 30:14.809
Daniel.

30:15.107 --> 30:17.598
- Yes, sir.
- Gonna deputize you.

30:17.693 --> 30:18.891
No pay.

30:19.361 --> 30:20.476
That figures.

30:20.571 --> 30:22.528
Hold up your right hand.

30:24.324 --> 30:27.491
Do you swear to uphold the law
of Baird, Texas...

30:27.578 --> 30:29.202
United States of America?

30:35.419 --> 30:38.669
And I ain't gonna forget
your taking care of Billy Joe, either.

30:38.755 --> 30:41.626
He's a lot younger than my other boarders.

30:41.717 --> 30:44.208
But it'll be nice to have
a young boy around again.

30:44.303 --> 30:46.010
I sure appreciate it.

30:46.096 --> 30:50.888
And if he stays, it'll be the first Cahill
I've been able to keep under my roof.

30:52.519 --> 30:55.437
If he causes you any trouble,
you just sit right down on him.

30:55.522 --> 30:56.981
And as for you, Billy Joe...

30:57.065 --> 30:59.058
What the hell are you whispering about?

30:59.151 --> 31:01.523
Don't you know
that whispering ain't polite...

31:01.612 --> 31:03.937
except in church, or a courtroom?

31:04.072 --> 31:05.946
What he's saying ain't private, Pa.

31:06.033 --> 31:09.567
Billy Joe was thinking you ought
to let the doctor see your shoulder.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.868
It's been took care of, bandaged, and...

31:11.955 --> 31:14.411
- By whom, J.D.?
- By what?

31:14.499 --> 31:15.579
Whom?

31:15.751 --> 31:18.372
That's the correct way of asking
who done it.

31:18.462 --> 31:19.742
I took care of it.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.463
Purified it with whiskey.

31:21.548 --> 31:23.920
Yeah, a quart and a half. He drunk it.

31:24.009 --> 31:25.124
You're scared.

31:25.218 --> 31:27.460
You're scared of Dr. Jones is what you are.

31:27.554 --> 31:29.879
They say the last time
you was in his office...

31:29.973 --> 31:32.643
they could hear you yelling
from Austin to El Paso.

31:32.726 --> 31:34.766
- Get the horses.
- Billy Joe's right.

31:35.187 --> 31:37.642
They say he's hit notes
music publishers ain't heard.

31:37.731 --> 31:39.605
Get the horses, Daniel.

31:42.235 --> 31:44.109
Austin to El Paso?

31:44.780 --> 31:46.938
Thought I yelled louder than that.

31:47.032 --> 31:48.147
Hetty.

31:48.367 --> 31:49.612
Goodbye.

32:08.303 --> 32:10.130
Come on. Let's go in.

32:15.519 --> 32:16.978
Where are we going?

32:17.062 --> 32:19.849
First we'll pick ourselves up a tracker.

32:19.940 --> 32:22.727
That 'breed Comanche
over by the Goldicks' place?

32:22.818 --> 32:25.653
The one thing i hate
more than a Comanche is half of one.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.362
His name is Lightfoot.

32:27.447 --> 32:30.484
I wouldn't call him 'breed to his face,
were i you.

32:30.576 --> 32:33.031
Not if you want to reach maturity.

32:42.337 --> 32:44.496
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

32:53.682 --> 32:57.015
Didn't take that Struther long
to make new friends.

33:20.792 --> 33:22.869
Papa, a stranger's coming.

33:24.213 --> 33:25.541
I see him.

33:42.314 --> 33:44.472
Good morning, my dear Chief.

33:44.691 --> 33:47.229
I hope all goes well in your lives.

33:49.822 --> 33:51.529
How about a cigar?

33:53.575 --> 33:54.773
Chief?

33:54.868 --> 33:56.066
Cigar?

33:57.079 --> 33:59.202
What the hell do you want, J.D.?

33:59.289 --> 34:00.700
I ain't got no money.

34:00.791 --> 34:02.830
My horse is on his last legs.

34:02.918 --> 34:06.453
And my genuine bearskin overcoat,
I lost in a crap game.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.081
Need a tracker, Lightfoot.

34:10.342 --> 34:11.753
That's better.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.635
How long would you say?

34:13.719 --> 34:15.594
Two days, maybe three.

34:16.264 --> 34:17.427
It's...

34:17.516 --> 34:19.554
cold up in them mountains.

34:20.393 --> 34:21.936
That's a fact.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.139
First day, $5.

34:25.232 --> 34:27.225
$2 a day thereafter.

34:27.609 --> 34:28.938
That's agreeable.

34:29.027 --> 34:30.141
I'll track.

34:30.237 --> 34:31.612
Any killing, you do it.

34:31.697 --> 34:33.274
Might be friends of mine.

34:33.364 --> 34:34.989
That's suitable.

34:35.367 --> 34:36.565
Ma'am.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.952
Morning, gentlemen.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.699
Daniel.

34:41.081 --> 34:43.322
I don't tip my hat to a squaw.

34:44.626 --> 34:46.619
Ain't no squaw's gonna...

34:48.922 --> 34:50.714
My apologies, ma'am.

34:50.882 --> 34:53.456
Slight negligence in his upbringing.

35:15.490 --> 35:16.653
Ma'am?

36:02.371 --> 36:04.114
What you bringing us up here for?

36:04.206 --> 36:05.451
Don't you know?

36:05.541 --> 36:07.165
If i knowed i wouldn't ask.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.160
What are you walking on?

36:09.586 --> 36:10.962
Rock face.

36:11.046 --> 36:13.039
That's right, rock face.

36:13.382 --> 36:17.331
Starts back there out of Valentine,
climbs all the way up...

36:17.427 --> 36:19.052
to Heaven, so the...

36:19.388 --> 36:20.882
Comanches say.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.595
Now, nobody just disappears, Daniel.

36:24.726 --> 36:27.930
If the men that killed Ben Grady
ain't in town...

36:28.063 --> 36:31.562
and didn't leave tracks
that two Apaches could read...

36:31.817 --> 36:33.975
then they're up here somewhere.

36:34.069 --> 36:36.394
And if they are, I'll find them.

36:36.863 --> 36:38.274
Yes, sir, Daniel.

36:38.365 --> 36:41.236
That's the truth you can bank on
in Denver.

36:41.618 --> 36:43.445
If they're up here...

36:43.579 --> 36:45.073
I'll find them.

37:19.614 --> 37:21.157
Been smelling smoke.

37:21.241 --> 37:22.949
Half a mile down the ridge.

37:23.035 --> 37:24.315
How many?

37:25.704 --> 37:27.613
Hired on as a tracker.

37:33.420 --> 37:34.962
Stay here, Daniel.

37:35.047 --> 37:36.707
I'll have a look.

38:09.289 --> 38:11.163
Something on your mind?

38:11.250 --> 38:12.874
Just thinking...

38:13.210 --> 38:17.077
if you wasn't J.D. 's boy,
what a good time i'd have right now.

38:18.131 --> 38:21.583
What I'd like to do to you
brings back fond memories.

38:22.511 --> 38:24.836
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:24.930 --> 38:26.590
I don't like you.

38:26.682 --> 38:28.970
That's what i'm talking about.

38:33.021 --> 38:35.726
Let me tell you something, half-breed.

38:35.857 --> 38:40.400
- I don't care what you have to say about...
- You don't care about anything.

38:41.071 --> 38:43.942
The difference between you
and J.D. Cahill.

38:45.033 --> 38:48.070
Even them that hates him,
admire him for that.

38:49.204 --> 38:50.532
He cares.

38:51.748 --> 38:54.500
He doesn't care about Billy Joe and me.

38:58.672 --> 39:02.835
Kid, i've had buffalo brains
that's got more going for them than you.

39:03.677 --> 39:07.377
You got a bad feeling about your pa
'cause he ain't home every night...

39:07.472 --> 39:09.679
to powder your butt and tuck you in.

39:09.766 --> 39:12.388
What business is it of yours, anyway?

39:12.686 --> 39:14.513
I've ridden with him.

39:14.896 --> 39:16.556
And i've sweat with him.

39:16.648 --> 39:18.641
And i've froze with him.

39:19.359 --> 39:21.233
And i've tracked for him.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.312
And i've cooked for him.

39:23.697 --> 39:26.402
And i've covered
even two dozen gunfights...

39:26.491 --> 39:27.986
Here he comes.

39:30.746 --> 39:32.406
And what's more...

39:32.498 --> 39:37.124
I've set near about every bone in his body
that's decent enough to talk about.

39:41.089 --> 39:44.873
They're out there, all right,
camped in the shelter of some trees.

39:45.052 --> 39:46.297
Daniel...

39:46.428 --> 39:47.708
get your rifle.

39:47.804 --> 39:49.263
You taking him with you?

39:49.348 --> 39:50.427
Yeah.

39:50.516 --> 39:51.714
J. D...

39:52.101 --> 39:53.760
give me my $5.

39:54.103 --> 39:56.593
You get shot tonight, I disappear.

39:56.897 --> 39:58.806
I'll come back and bury you.

39:58.899 --> 40:01.935
Mumble something Christian
over your grave.

40:03.570 --> 40:06.939
Lightfoot, your kindness overwhelms me.

40:09.117 --> 40:11.609
It might not be them out there, Pa.

40:15.207 --> 40:16.867
Let's go ask them.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.927
- The fire's dying out.
- Let it.

40:44.319 --> 40:48.187
I'd think a long time
before I did anything rash.

40:56.081 --> 40:57.326
Cahill.

40:59.167 --> 41:01.041
United States Marshal.

41:04.923 --> 41:06.880
- Pa!
- Hold it!

41:09.761 --> 41:12.798
Mister, I ain't got a bigoted bone
in my body.

41:13.015 --> 41:14.675
You don't drop that axe...

41:14.766 --> 41:18.218
I'll blast you to Hell
as quick as I would a white man.

41:25.944 --> 41:27.355
Come on in.

41:30.699 --> 41:33.534
All right. Let's get rid of the hardware.

41:35.871 --> 41:36.985
Boy.

41:37.205 --> 41:39.447
I ain't got no knife, mister.

41:47.341 --> 41:48.621
Friend...

41:48.884 --> 41:51.422
you look like a hideaway man to me.

41:51.887 --> 41:53.002
What is it?

41:53.096 --> 41:55.054
Derringer or a palm gun?

42:02.981 --> 42:04.310
Lightfoot.

42:04.399 --> 42:05.514
Yeah?

42:06.276 --> 42:08.233
Are they friends of yours?

42:08.320 --> 42:09.399
Nope.

42:10.072 --> 42:11.898
You know them at all?

42:12.866 --> 42:13.981
Nope.

42:16.745 --> 42:17.943
Daniel?

42:19.081 --> 42:20.540
I don't know them.

42:20.624 --> 42:24.787
That ought to do about as much damage
to a bank door as a sledgehammer.

42:24.878 --> 42:26.918
Wouldn't you say, Daniel?

42:41.437 --> 42:42.812
New money.

42:53.991 --> 42:55.782
Where'd you get it?

42:58.537 --> 43:00.280
Where'd you get it?

43:01.081 --> 43:02.456
Don't, Pa!

43:02.958 --> 43:05.875
Ben Grady leaves a wife
and two little boys.

43:07.462 --> 43:09.289
I asked you a question.

43:09.381 --> 43:12.002
You may gather i'm a little impatient.

43:12.134 --> 43:14.173
Where'd you get that money?

43:14.261 --> 43:17.381
We took it from a Mormon drover
in New Mexico.

43:17.764 --> 43:20.302
We had a lot less than we needed...

43:20.392 --> 43:22.301
and he had a lot more than he needed.

43:22.394 --> 43:24.636
Mormon drover in New Mexico?

43:24.938 --> 43:26.219
Yes, sir.

43:26.815 --> 43:28.724
That's the God's truth.

43:34.656 --> 43:35.985
How old are you, boy?

43:36.074 --> 43:37.272
He's 16.

43:37.367 --> 43:39.277
Just turned 16, is all.

43:39.661 --> 43:41.156
Belong to you?

43:41.246 --> 43:42.657
My grandson.

43:51.715 --> 43:53.838
Mister, you ain't gonna put those on me.

43:53.926 --> 43:57.010
- Daniel, get their horses.
- You ain't going to!

43:57.095 --> 43:59.302
Either that or i'll kill you.

44:04.853 --> 44:06.596
I don't think they did it, Pa.

44:06.772 --> 44:09.310
That's for the jury to say, not me.

44:09.858 --> 44:11.851
I don't think they did it.

44:17.032 --> 44:19.701
Son, if you know something I don't...

44:19.868 --> 44:22.193
I'd be obliged to hear about it.

44:25.582 --> 44:27.907
Otherwise, go get their horses.

44:53.402 --> 44:56.486
- Five pounds of tea.
- Golden tips, ma'am?

44:56.572 --> 44:59.407
No, Oongal or Black Oolong, Mr. Campbell.

45:00.283 --> 45:03.984
And a 140-pound sack
of Ceylon java coffee.

45:06.206 --> 45:09.789
Five pounds of Wilbur's Breakfast Cocoa.

45:11.128 --> 45:13.167
One pound of black pepper.

45:13.255 --> 45:15.497
Five pounds of mustard powder.

45:16.884 --> 45:20.087
And three quarts
of medicinal blackberry brandy.

45:23.181 --> 45:25.803
Look who's got his nose in the candy.

45:28.937 --> 45:30.562
He can have two.

45:33.442 --> 45:34.984
There's two...

45:37.362 --> 45:39.319
and two more for good luck, Billy Joe.

45:39.406 --> 45:40.781
Thank you!

45:42.284 --> 45:44.989
And six two-pound tins of plum pudding.

45:45.454 --> 45:48.455
And i want...
Now, Billy Joe, put that down.

45:48.540 --> 45:52.075
- That's much too heavy for you.
- No, ma'am. Not at all.

45:57.090 --> 45:58.253
And...

45:58.342 --> 46:00.749
a dozen Crosse & Blackwell mixed jerky.

46:41.343 --> 46:43.916
The money wasn't
where it was supposed to be.

46:44.137 --> 46:46.213
It wasn't where we told you to put it.

46:46.390 --> 46:48.762
And we looked, but it just wasn't there.

46:49.017 --> 46:51.343
We is some disappointed in you, boy.

46:51.437 --> 46:54.770
Struther practically being a father to you,
and all.

46:55.607 --> 46:58.941
And him taking your betrayal of us
real personally...

46:59.653 --> 47:03.022
he wanted to come into town
and cut you up real bad.

47:03.407 --> 47:05.446
But i told him that wasn't necessary.

47:05.534 --> 47:07.823
There must be
some kind of misunderstanding...

47:07.911 --> 47:09.904
cause you is a good boy.

47:11.081 --> 47:12.623
A good boy...

47:14.209 --> 47:16.249
who wouldn't betray his friends.

47:16.336 --> 47:20.204
No, sir. I just wouldn't believe
that you'd do anything so...

47:22.009 --> 47:23.254
foolish.

47:24.887 --> 47:26.546
Where's the money?

47:28.890 --> 47:30.171
Struther.

47:34.104 --> 47:35.646
Where's the money?

47:35.772 --> 47:38.727
- I hid it.
- Where? You hid it where?

47:41.236 --> 47:43.063
I ain't telling. I ain't.

47:43.155 --> 47:46.072
Why in the hell not, you little son of a...

47:47.451 --> 47:50.286
Why not?
Would you explain it to me, please?

47:51.496 --> 47:53.822
Because me and mine
don't like to be threatened...

47:53.916 --> 47:56.157
and chased and told what to do.

47:59.421 --> 48:02.505
If you kill me,
you ain't never gonna find that money.

48:02.591 --> 48:03.753
Never!

48:06.803 --> 48:10.172
Pick him up. We gotta take him
where nobody will hear him scream.

48:10.265 --> 48:12.258
- Come here.
- Let me down!

48:13.268 --> 48:14.928
- Damn you.
- Get him!

48:24.112 --> 48:25.939
Watch out! Damn wire!

48:46.343 --> 48:48.585
Where the hell did he get to?

49:25.173 --> 49:26.668
Trouble, J.D.

49:27.509 --> 49:28.837
I see them.

49:32.431 --> 49:34.222
They look nasty, Pa.

49:34.516 --> 49:35.679
Yeah.

49:36.894 --> 49:39.182
Friends of Ben Grady, I guess.

49:39.604 --> 49:40.636
Yeah.

49:40.772 --> 49:42.267
There's that.

49:42.649 --> 49:44.559
But mostly, it's money.

49:45.444 --> 49:48.398
Bank gets robbed, town goes broke.

49:48.947 --> 49:52.731
Most people think
all that money belongs to the bankers.

49:53.535 --> 49:54.815
It don't.

49:55.204 --> 49:57.113
It's the little folks' savings.

49:57.247 --> 49:58.789
What about us?

49:59.666 --> 50:00.781
Yeah.

50:00.959 --> 50:02.537
What about you?

50:23.148 --> 50:25.390
We'll take them from here on, J.D.

50:25.567 --> 50:27.109
Just like that?

50:27.736 --> 50:29.278
Just like that.

50:29.738 --> 50:32.739
Lightfoot, how far away
would you say they are?

50:32.824 --> 50:34.901
About 10, 12 feet.

50:35.410 --> 50:38.080
Make a good pattern for this buckshot.

50:38.747 --> 50:40.953
There's no use potting around.

50:41.041 --> 50:43.330
I'm willing to die trying to keep them.

50:43.418 --> 50:46.668
The question is, are you willing to die
trying to take them?

50:56.098 --> 50:58.423
Now, I'm cold and hungry, and...

50:58.976 --> 51:01.431
wet and tired and short-tempered.

51:01.812 --> 51:03.520
So get on with it.

51:07.776 --> 51:09.733
Hell, get out of my way!

51:40.684 --> 51:42.143
- J.D.!
- Hank.

51:44.104 --> 51:46.726
Your littlest boy's come down
with something.

51:47.441 --> 51:48.520
Bad?

51:49.193 --> 51:50.817
That's the word.

51:51.945 --> 51:53.190
Cock it.

52:04.041 --> 52:05.239
Howdy.

52:17.512 --> 52:19.671
Go on, I'll take care of it.

52:33.362 --> 52:34.311
Where is he?

52:34.404 --> 52:36.860
- He's in with the doctor, J.D.
- Which room?

52:37.032 --> 52:40.697
The doctor doesn't want anybody in there
until he's finished with the boy.

52:41.036 --> 52:43.527
Now, you can just wait right here.

52:47.542 --> 52:48.705
Women.

52:56.176 --> 52:58.750
Things seem to happen to you two
when I'm...

52:58.971 --> 53:00.169
not around.

53:00.263 --> 53:03.134
Like the time Gordine's horse kicked you...

53:03.308 --> 53:05.052
- And broke your leg...
- Pa?

53:05.143 --> 53:06.887
And the time Billy Joe...

53:06.979 --> 53:09.470
- Got poison ivy all over his face and...
- Pa?

53:11.567 --> 53:13.476
You ain't never around.

53:16.280 --> 53:19.446
You're dead right, Daniel.
I can't argue that.

53:20.742 --> 53:24.491
I've been gone a lot of times
when you kids really needed me.

53:26.331 --> 53:28.454
And I've missed a lot, too.

53:29.668 --> 53:32.040
Missed watching you two grow up.

53:34.047 --> 53:35.672
I think about it a lot...

53:35.799 --> 53:37.293
on every job...

53:37.634 --> 53:39.674
about how, when it's over...

53:39.761 --> 53:43.629
I'll come home and the three of us
will get to know one another.

53:44.391 --> 53:47.143
But even before that job was finished...

53:47.686 --> 53:49.928
another one always seemed...

53:50.021 --> 53:51.219
to crop up.

53:52.524 --> 53:55.311
Another bank robbed, another murder.

53:57.529 --> 54:01.396
I don't want what I'm saying
to sound like I'm making excuses.

54:01.992 --> 54:04.447
There's no excuse for negligence.

54:06.538 --> 54:08.994
No excuse for a man ignoring his...

54:09.875 --> 54:11.333
duty, either.

54:13.003 --> 54:14.166
Your mother...

54:14.254 --> 54:15.879
God bless her...

54:16.924 --> 54:18.750
when she was dying...

54:19.843 --> 54:22.548
the last thing she said on earth was:

54:23.555 --> 54:25.263
"Go get them, J.D."

54:26.391 --> 54:28.349
And I've been going...

54:29.645 --> 54:31.970
and getting them ever since...

54:33.523 --> 54:36.145
till it's no longer just my job.

54:37.402 --> 54:39.194
It's part of my life.

54:40.947 --> 54:44.399
And that's what I want you
to try and understand, Son.

54:45.369 --> 54:47.196
Your old man's life.

54:48.747 --> 54:50.656
Will you give it a try?

54:52.084 --> 54:54.207
Yeah, Pa. I'll try.

54:55.254 --> 54:56.629
I'm glad...

54:57.547 --> 55:00.252
'cause even grown men
need understanding.

55:03.470 --> 55:05.759
I'll be by tomorrow, Billy Joe.

55:06.265 --> 55:07.344
Doc.

55:08.851 --> 55:10.760
He has a high fever, J.D.

55:10.853 --> 55:12.133
How high?

55:12.479 --> 55:13.724
A hundred and three.

55:13.814 --> 55:17.099
- A hundred and three...
- But it's not climbing, it's leveled off.

55:18.277 --> 55:20.186
The boy has a touch of pneumonia.

55:20.279 --> 55:22.770
- Just pneumonia?
- But he's young.

55:23.198 --> 55:25.356
Proper bed rest, good care...

55:25.534 --> 55:26.814
he'll be as good as new.

55:26.910 --> 55:28.155
You sure, Doc?

55:28.245 --> 55:31.448
I'd bet my brand-new, Chicago-made...

55:31.540 --> 55:33.331
leg amputator on it.

55:33.917 --> 55:35.744
He's worried about one thing, though.

55:35.836 --> 55:36.915
What's that?

55:37.004 --> 55:38.249
Your shoulder.

55:38.338 --> 55:40.414
He wants me to take a look at it.

55:40.507 --> 55:41.586
Forget it.

55:41.675 --> 55:42.838
Thanks, Doc.

55:42.926 --> 55:45.631
- Can we...
- Go right ahead.

55:53.187 --> 55:54.729
Hello, Budger.

55:55.689 --> 55:57.100
How are you?

55:57.733 --> 55:59.108
I'm all right, Pa.

55:59.193 --> 56:01.944
Sure you're all right, you're a Cahill.

56:02.404 --> 56:05.939
Cahills have survived floods,
earthquakes, pestilence...

56:06.116 --> 56:09.567
every natural disaster known to man.
Not to mention...

56:10.203 --> 56:11.995
a few unnatural ones.

56:13.040 --> 56:16.041
Can I get you anything?
You hungry or thirsty?

56:16.209 --> 56:17.241
No.

56:18.462 --> 56:20.585
I'm just a little tired, Pa.

56:21.840 --> 56:24.331
All right, Son. You get some sleep.

56:24.760 --> 56:26.254
Get some rest.

56:27.262 --> 56:29.634
When you get back on your feet...

56:29.723 --> 56:31.301
me and you and...

56:31.391 --> 56:33.135
old Daniel there...

56:33.811 --> 56:36.302
gonna get to know each other better.

56:36.855 --> 56:40.141
- It sounds like a promise.
- You can believe it, Son.

56:43.904 --> 56:45.564
- Pa?
- Yes.

56:47.991 --> 56:50.482
You never told me a promise before.

56:54.289 --> 56:55.369
No...

56:56.833 --> 56:58.458
I guess I never.

57:02.798 --> 57:04.173
Hetty, I...

57:05.467 --> 57:07.127
I'll be back.

57:07.427 --> 57:09.753
I gotta check on some prisoners.

57:20.274 --> 57:22.147
I'll sit with him now.

57:24.778 --> 57:27.186
You look done in yourself, Daniel.

57:27.281 --> 57:28.479
No.

57:28.740 --> 57:30.532
Only on the outside.

57:47.301 --> 57:49.258
Tried to kill me, Danny.

57:49.678 --> 57:52.050
I hid the money
and wouldn't tell him where...

57:52.139 --> 57:54.926
because I thought
we might wanna give it back.

57:55.058 --> 57:58.593
And they tried to kill me.
I been afeard to sleep, Danny.

57:59.271 --> 58:01.560
You go to sleep, Billy Joe Cahill.

58:01.648 --> 58:03.558
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

58:57.579 --> 58:59.204
- Danny!
- Sit down!

59:01.250 --> 59:03.373
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time, boy.

59:03.460 --> 59:06.212
- And if you don't answer...
- Close the window.

59:06.463 --> 59:08.123
- What'd you say?
- Close the window.

59:08.215 --> 59:10.788
My brother's sick.
You want him to catch his death?

59:24.439 --> 59:26.099
Where's the money?

59:26.650 --> 59:29.686
We killed two men to get it.
You gotta understand, boy...

59:29.778 --> 59:33.277
we ain't gonna hang any longer
or be any deader if we kill two more.

59:33.365 --> 59:34.740
Where's our money?

59:36.743 --> 59:38.487
Tell him, Billy Joe.

59:38.662 --> 59:42.494
Let him have the money and get.
We'll give ourselves up and confess.

59:43.083 --> 59:46.618
I never meant for four innocent men
to hang for something I did, anyway.

59:52.342 --> 59:54.134
Tell him, Billy Joe.

59:58.014 --> 59:59.260
I can't.

59:59.474 --> 01:00:01.763
You don't believe I'll kill you?

01:00:03.312 --> 01:00:05.020
It was pitch-dark.

01:00:05.105 --> 01:00:07.513
And I was scared near outta my pants.

01:00:07.608 --> 01:00:10.099
I went this way and that way, and...

01:00:10.819 --> 01:00:12.017
well...

01:00:12.362 --> 01:00:14.070
I know where it is.

01:00:15.198 --> 01:00:17.524
But I can't tell you where it is.

01:00:17.617 --> 01:00:20.951
I kinda have to find it again,
if you can understand?

01:00:24.916 --> 01:00:26.459
Get him dressed.

01:00:26.543 --> 01:00:28.832
- He's got pneumonia.
- I don't give a...

01:00:28.921 --> 01:00:31.411
- What'd you say?
- I said, he's got pneumonia.

01:00:31.506 --> 01:00:35.207
Even if you kill me and take him,
he won't live an hour out in that rain.

01:00:45.354 --> 01:00:47.761
When did the doctor say
he'd be on his feet again?

01:00:47.856 --> 01:00:49.231
Didn't say.

01:00:51.777 --> 01:00:54.315
When he is, you know where we'll be.

01:00:54.988 --> 01:00:56.067
Yeah.

01:01:10.545 --> 01:01:11.874
You swear.

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:17.635
You swear on your brother's life
and on his everlasting spirit...

01:01:17.719 --> 01:01:21.764
may it rot in Hell for time eternal
if you break your oath to me.

01:01:22.599 --> 01:01:26.431
You swear you'll bring that money to me
within a fortnight.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.686
And that you won't tell anybody,
anybody at all...

01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:31.351
about what you've done.

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.273
Or what we done before you.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.601
Swear it.

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:42.983
I swear.

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:46.706
On your brother's life and eternal spirit.

01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:50.454
On my brother's life and eternal spirit.

01:02:20.741 --> 01:02:22.152
Funny thing.

01:02:23.535 --> 01:02:25.777
I keep thinking about my mama.

01:02:25.871 --> 01:02:28.160
She said I was born to be hung.

01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:32.452
But to be hung for something I didn't do.

01:02:33.962 --> 01:02:35.587
Of all the bad things I've done.

01:02:35.672 --> 01:02:38.673
I killed my first man
when I was 12 years old.

01:02:38.884 --> 01:02:40.544
Now to be hung...

01:02:43.055 --> 01:02:46.340
- You know who's going to do it?
- That kid, I guess.

01:02:46.933 --> 01:02:48.677
He's acting sheriff.

01:02:50.103 --> 01:02:52.594
Sure hope he knows what he's doing.

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:55.354
I seen a man choke-hung once.

01:02:56.443 --> 01:02:58.649
Didn't break his neck proper.

01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:01.988
It was five minutes
before he stopped kicking.

01:03:02.991 --> 01:03:04.699
Did they shoot him?

01:03:05.202 --> 01:03:06.400
No.

01:03:06.912 --> 01:03:09.533
It wasn't a lynching, you understand.

01:03:10.123 --> 01:03:12.412
It was a legal, proper hanging.

01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:16.079
And they don't shoot you
at legal, proper hangings.

01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:18.005
Dirty bastards.

01:03:22.385 --> 01:03:23.844
Good morning.

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:43.899
There's some makings.

01:03:46.451 --> 01:03:48.907
- You the one that chews?
- Yes, sir.

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:53.743
Thank you kindly.

01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:55.708
They made up their minds yet?

01:03:59.089 --> 01:04:00.749
Wednesday morning.

01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:08.676
Two days.

01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:21.438
Marshal?

01:04:24.865 --> 01:04:26.608
This damn animal...

01:04:26.867 --> 01:04:28.610
keeps taking in air.

01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:31.949
Looks pretty grim
for them fellows in there.

01:04:32.039 --> 01:04:33.118
Yeah.

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:35.911
Mr. Cahill, you think they did it?

01:04:37.002 --> 01:04:39.754
Jury said they did. Judge sentenced them.

01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:42.881
What I'm asking is,
do you think they did it?

01:04:44.927 --> 01:04:47.168
I think they're guilty as hell...

01:04:47.304 --> 01:04:50.305
of robbing a Mormon drover
in New Mexico.

01:04:52.142 --> 01:04:53.553
And I gotta hang them.

01:04:56.229 --> 01:04:57.973
Goes with the badge.

01:05:15.374 --> 01:05:19.241
Anytime you boys want to come back,
you're welcome, and don't you forget that.

01:05:19.336 --> 01:05:22.752
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thanks for taking care of me, too.

01:05:22.839 --> 01:05:25.461
I was glad to do anything I could, Billy Joe.

01:05:25.551 --> 01:05:27.839
You kinda like our pa, don't you?

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.593
Now, what makes you say that?

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.006
You look at him funny sometimes.

01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:36.142
Maybe there's a lot of words
being spoke inside your head...

01:05:36.228 --> 01:05:38.220
that nobody can hear except you.

01:05:38.313 --> 01:05:41.848
Billy Joe, I'll talk to you
about that in 10 or 15 years.

01:05:45.738 --> 01:05:48.026
That sound gives me the shivers.

01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:51.733
I wonder what it's doing
to those who're waiting for it.

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:55.744
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Bye.

01:05:56.206 --> 01:05:57.237
Bye.

01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:36.671
Things didn't work out
like we planned, did they, Danny?

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:39.177
No, they didn't.

01:07:41.145 --> 01:07:44.395
And I ain't blaming
that no-good Struther, neither.

01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:49.312
It was like the Lord and the Devil
was having a tug of war in my gut.

01:07:49.736 --> 01:07:51.230
The Devil won.

01:07:52.114 --> 01:07:54.486
Seems like the Devil always wins.

01:07:55.033 --> 01:07:57.987
Maybe that's why so many people
are on his side.

01:07:58.078 --> 01:07:59.157
Yeah.

01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:01.114
But I ain't really.

01:08:01.832 --> 01:08:04.833
I just wanted to get back at Pa
for never being around.

01:08:04.918 --> 01:08:06.792
Pa ain't so bad, Danny.

01:08:07.004 --> 01:08:10.622
Let's tell him about the whole thing
and be done with it.

01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:12.378
We can't.

01:08:13.135 --> 01:08:15.840
Figure we don't know him
well enough yet?

01:08:16.305 --> 01:08:17.965
No, that ain't it.

01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:22.509
If Pa gets himself into something,
he gets himself out.

01:08:22.645 --> 01:08:24.767
And that's what we gotta do.

01:08:26.356 --> 01:08:29.274
Get ourselves out
without Fraser killing us.

01:08:31.862 --> 01:08:34.187
Sure is hard, acting like a man.

01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:41.819
- Almost didn't find you.
- Hell, J. D...

01:08:41.913 --> 01:08:43.906
I left a trail a blind man could follow.

01:08:43.999 --> 01:08:45.577
- They didn't go home?
- Nope.

01:08:45.667 --> 01:08:47.874
- Where are they?
- Right there.

01:08:49.045 --> 01:08:51.537
- What are they doing?
- Just sitting.

01:08:52.758 --> 01:08:55.000
- They pick up the money?
- Nope.

01:08:58.305 --> 01:08:59.550
Fishing.

01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:02.216
Just sitting and fishing.

01:09:02.975 --> 01:09:05.728
Four men are gonna hang
for something they didn't do...

01:09:05.812 --> 01:09:08.386
and they're just sitting and fishing.

01:09:25.624 --> 01:09:27.118
There they go.

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:29.580
Lightfoot.

01:09:31.087 --> 01:09:33.709
Amy and me tried for a lot of years...

01:09:34.424 --> 01:09:36.084
to have children.

01:09:36.635 --> 01:09:37.796
But...

01:09:38.929 --> 01:09:41.764
maybe they came along too late in my life.

01:09:43.434 --> 01:09:46.055
- Yeah?
- There ain't nothing too late...

01:09:46.937 --> 01:09:48.479
if you love it.

01:10:21.555 --> 01:10:23.594
Danny!

01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:25.636
I'm here.

01:10:56.673 --> 01:10:57.788
Here.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.805
Come on.

01:11:27.288 --> 01:11:28.532
Come on.

01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:41.421
Where'd you bury it, Billy Joe?

01:11:43.011 --> 01:11:45.929
It was pitch-black. I didn't have a lantern.

01:11:46.181 --> 01:11:47.212
I...

01:11:48.475 --> 01:11:50.218
can't quite remember.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.523
There.

01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:01.351
Hold this.

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:17.994
You're making enough noise
to wake the dead.

01:12:18.088 --> 01:12:20.626
It wouldn't hurt
to be a little quiet and careful.

01:12:20.715 --> 01:12:21.830
For what?

01:12:21.925 --> 01:12:24.214
To take candy away from babies?

01:12:29.433 --> 01:12:32.054
Why do you suppose
they wouldn't tell me?

01:12:32.144 --> 01:12:35.228
Didn't they know
if they confided in me, I'd...

01:12:36.815 --> 01:12:38.689
Give them a chance, J.D.

01:12:38.858 --> 01:12:41.776
Probably got it worked out
in some kids' way.

01:12:41.862 --> 01:12:42.941
Kids?

01:12:43.071 --> 01:12:44.530
Bank robbers.

01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:56.663
God!

01:12:56.751 --> 01:12:59.124
Some poor soul leaving his mortal body.

01:12:59.212 --> 01:13:02.795
- I knowed! I know it!
- I think it's just an old hoot owl.

01:13:04.843 --> 01:13:06.124
You sure?

01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:08.293
Nope.

01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:19.980
Did you see them bank robbers
jump out of their pants...

01:13:20.275 --> 01:13:21.817
when that old owl hooted?

01:13:21.902 --> 01:13:25.770
I am now gonna give them a scare
they ain't never gonna forget.

01:13:25.989 --> 01:13:29.987
While their pants are down,
I'll give them a little parental guidance.

01:13:33.205 --> 01:13:36.490
- Found something?
- I hope it's the right something.

01:13:39.878 --> 01:13:41.917
- They got the money.
- Yeah.

01:13:45.384 --> 01:13:46.628
Come on.

01:14:23.463 --> 01:14:25.041
Holy Christmas!

01:14:25.715 --> 01:14:28.385
Like taking candy away from babies?

01:14:28.719 --> 01:14:30.047
Very funny.

01:14:34.349 --> 01:14:36.556
I'll tell you something funnier.

01:14:36.685 --> 01:14:38.891
- What's that?
- My leg's broke.

01:14:46.111 --> 01:14:49.278
We're gonna have to straighten it
and splint it.

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:56.233
I thought an Indian didn't show pain.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.865
Especially a bona fide
Comanche war chief.

01:15:00.083 --> 01:15:03.417
Who in the hell ever told you that,
a damn white man?

01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:07.756
This is gonna hurt.
Here's something to bite on.

01:15:08.842 --> 01:15:10.336
Thank you, J.D.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.612
This knothead of yours...

01:15:38.956 --> 01:15:41.447
almost ran my butt into the ground.

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:43.666
Couldn't find mine.

01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:45.952
Must've headed for the barn.

01:15:48.465 --> 01:15:50.791
I hope you're enjoying my cigar.

01:15:52.052 --> 01:15:53.297
Not bad.

01:15:54.138 --> 01:15:55.632
How's the leg?

01:15:55.848 --> 01:15:59.430
If you're asking me as a war chief
of the Comanche nation...

01:15:59.518 --> 01:16:01.309
I don't feel a thing.

01:16:01.728 --> 01:16:05.347
If you're asking the white part of me,
it hurts like hell.

01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:12.609
- That's the white man groaning, I take it?
- You're damn right.

01:16:25.043 --> 01:16:27.795
I'll need that bottle of whiskey you've got.

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:32.213
When you're finished with this thing,
if you should come out alive...

01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:35.005
you can come
and do some hunting for me.

01:16:35.178 --> 01:16:37.301
I'll be stove up all spring.

01:16:41.393 --> 01:16:44.513
Yeah. You might bring
a box of them cigars, too.

01:16:44.604 --> 01:16:46.514
You ain't finished yet.

01:16:47.148 --> 01:16:49.355
- Ain't finished?
- That's right.

01:16:49.693 --> 01:16:52.563
What the hell are you talking about?
My leg's broke.

01:16:52.654 --> 01:16:54.860
I'm going home. That's what I'm gonna do.

01:16:54.948 --> 01:16:58.115
- No, you ain't. You're gonna finish the job.
- Why?

01:16:58.869 --> 01:17:01.111
Because you're a better tracker than I am.

01:17:01.205 --> 01:17:03.577
And there's no time for mistakes.

01:17:04.916 --> 01:17:06.576
So start tracking.

01:18:31.252 --> 01:18:33.375
You just stay where you are.

01:18:33.838 --> 01:18:35.878
MacDonald, this is Cahill.

01:18:36.675 --> 01:18:38.086
How are you?

01:18:38.343 --> 01:18:39.458
Fine.

01:18:39.887 --> 01:18:43.006
Leastwise, ain't no one tried
to hang me lately.

01:18:47.394 --> 01:18:48.509
Well?

01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:50.729
There's the gate.

01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:58.612
I'm in trouble.

01:18:59.656 --> 01:19:01.198
I need a horse.

01:19:03.577 --> 01:19:05.320
I'm willing to pay.

01:19:06.204 --> 01:19:07.829
In back of you.

01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:09.077
Thanks.

01:19:10.792 --> 01:19:12.370
That's no horse.

01:19:12.711 --> 01:19:14.205
It's a horse.

01:19:14.504 --> 01:19:18.584
Leastways, as much of a horse
as you'll find within 20 miles of here.

01:19:23.222 --> 01:19:26.341
I got an old McClellan.
I'll throw that in, $50.

01:19:26.934 --> 01:19:28.428
$50?

01:19:29.395 --> 01:19:31.138
You want them or not?

01:19:33.774 --> 01:19:35.102
Your feet.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.862
Get the McClellan.

01:19:45.494 --> 01:19:47.153
Stay with him, J.D.!

01:19:52.292 --> 01:19:53.787
Stay with him!

01:19:59.591 --> 01:20:01.798
Might be faster if you walked.

01:20:02.428 --> 01:20:04.254
More comfortable, too.

01:20:04.596 --> 01:20:06.921
Seeing as we're in such a hurry.

01:20:09.685 --> 01:20:12.602
Of course, $50 ain't too much to pay for...

01:20:13.021 --> 01:20:15.595
a spirited, well-bred animal like that.

01:20:15.857 --> 01:20:17.269
Lightfoot...

01:20:17.484 --> 01:20:20.650
I never heard a bona fide war chief
talk so much.

01:20:46.138 --> 01:20:48.807
How much further you calculate, Danny?

01:20:48.974 --> 01:20:50.717
About an hour.

01:21:51.495 --> 01:21:52.740
Stay here, Billy Joe.

01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:56.245
- No, sir, I can't...
- I said, you stay here, Billy Joe.

01:22:06.426 --> 01:22:07.625
Fraser!

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.724
Abe Fraser!

01:23:32.304 --> 01:23:33.964
Nobody's in there.

01:23:34.515 --> 01:23:35.677
No...

01:23:36.642 --> 01:23:37.970
Billy Joe?

01:23:40.395 --> 01:23:43.017
You shouldn't oughta treat me like a baby.

01:23:43.106 --> 01:23:46.356
- I'm near 13 years old.
- You're only 11, and that's all you are!

01:23:46.443 --> 01:23:50.227
Eleven going on 12,
and you ain't grown no brains yet at all.

01:23:50.697 --> 01:23:52.441
That's your excuse.

01:23:52.825 --> 01:23:53.987
I'm 17.

01:23:54.785 --> 01:23:59.031
I must've lost any brains I ever had
to get us into a mess like this.

01:24:03.251 --> 01:24:05.956
Those men are gonna hang because of us.

01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:08.913
I can't get it off my mind.

01:24:09.383 --> 01:24:12.585
If Fraser don't get here quick,
it'll be too late.

01:24:17.808 --> 01:24:21.806
You calculate that they'll kill us
if they can, don't you, Danny?

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:46.668
Don't like it.

01:24:46.753 --> 01:24:48.545
Don't like it at all.

01:24:49.464 --> 01:24:51.956
There ain't no easy way to do this.

01:24:54.177 --> 01:24:56.051
So let's go find out.

01:25:19.203 --> 01:25:20.282
Damn!

01:26:24.643 --> 01:26:25.972
Lightfoot!

01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:50.247
Well, don't break out in tears.

01:26:52.170 --> 01:26:54.840
You've seen dying men before, ain't you?

01:27:03.515 --> 01:27:05.057
I want a cigar.

01:27:07.436 --> 01:27:09.428
Won't do you much good...

01:27:09.688 --> 01:27:11.681
coughing the way you are.

01:27:12.232 --> 01:27:14.438
Won't do me no harm, neither.

01:27:41.136 --> 01:27:44.256
You don't have to worry about your family
while I'm alive.

01:27:44.348 --> 01:27:46.008
Hell, I know that.

01:27:49.603 --> 01:27:51.726
I always loved these things.

01:27:52.564 --> 01:27:54.557
Never could afford them.

01:29:08.724 --> 01:29:10.763
You got a nice bright fire.

01:29:10.851 --> 01:29:12.262
Signal fire.

01:29:13.979 --> 01:29:17.063
Except there's nobody to signal to.
Ain't that right, Brownie?

01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:19.556
I told you I took care of things.

01:29:20.986 --> 01:29:22.694
Where's your brother?

01:29:22.779 --> 01:29:24.439
Where's Billy Joe?

01:29:25.491 --> 01:29:27.399
Right here, Mr. Fraser.

01:29:30.579 --> 01:29:33.117
Boy, you better put that thing down.

01:29:33.332 --> 01:29:36.831
Billy Joe, that ain't necessary.
We're all friends here.

01:29:41.381 --> 01:29:43.504
Boy, this is old Abe Fraser.

01:29:44.218 --> 01:29:46.839
Danny, tell him that ain't necessary.

01:29:59.065 --> 01:30:01.188
There's your share of the money,
Mr. Fraser.

01:30:01.276 --> 01:30:03.482
Three-fifths. About $12,000.

01:30:05.989 --> 01:30:07.483
That ain't right, Danny.

01:30:07.574 --> 01:30:10.860
The usual way, the proper way,
is for the leader to make the split.

01:30:10.952 --> 01:30:15.282
It all works out the same way
but one likes to observe the proprieties.

01:30:15.374 --> 01:30:16.868
You understand.

01:30:17.751 --> 01:30:21.202
- You got the rest of the money with you?
- No, we don't.

01:30:21.338 --> 01:30:23.212
That money's well hid.

01:30:23.548 --> 01:30:25.956
We didn't come here
to get our throats slit.

01:30:26.259 --> 01:30:28.252
You'd just best take your share and go.

01:30:28.345 --> 01:30:30.918
You're a hard case, ain't you,
just like your old man?

01:30:31.014 --> 01:30:32.259
No, I ain't!

01:30:32.349 --> 01:30:36.299
If it was him, he'd shoot you
while he had the chance. Right now.

01:30:37.229 --> 01:30:39.980
You'd best take that money
and get while you still can.

01:30:40.065 --> 01:30:41.263
No.

01:30:42.067 --> 01:30:43.442
No, I won't.

01:30:44.277 --> 01:30:45.356
You won't?

01:30:45.445 --> 01:30:48.019
Not till I've had my say
and cleared my name.

01:30:48.407 --> 01:30:49.438
Fraser!

01:30:49.533 --> 01:30:51.905
We played fair and square with you.

01:30:51.994 --> 01:30:55.943
In spite of your youth and inexperience,
we agreed to share equally with you.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.415
And we have.

01:30:57.624 --> 01:30:59.748
You agree to that, don't you?

01:31:02.838 --> 01:31:04.711
And you, Billy Joe...

01:31:06.508 --> 01:31:09.877
who was it let you stay in bed
so you'd get well?

01:31:11.347 --> 01:31:14.881
Of course we had some disagreement,
on account of you changing your mind.

01:31:14.975 --> 01:31:16.137
Not us.

01:31:17.686 --> 01:31:20.259
I was gonna invite you
to come to my sister's with us.

01:31:20.355 --> 01:31:23.024
And take you under my wing, as it were.

01:31:26.153 --> 01:31:28.441
But I see that ain't your wish. So I'll...

01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:30.273
say goodbye to you.

01:31:32.117 --> 01:31:34.988
I offer you my hand in friendship
and in parting.

01:31:35.078 --> 01:31:38.447
I sure hope you won't shame me
by refusing to take it.

01:31:45.172 --> 01:31:46.963
Goodbye, Mr. Fraser.

01:32:47.859 --> 01:32:50.611
They'll be waiting for us,
won't they, Danny?

01:32:50.696 --> 01:32:53.021
Better now than in the daylight.

01:33:33.614 --> 01:33:34.645
Pa!

01:33:36.575 --> 01:33:39.742
- Am I ever glad to see you.
- Still got the money?

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:43.156
- Part of it.
- Fraser's taken his share already?

01:33:44.416 --> 01:33:45.447
Yes.

01:33:45.667 --> 01:33:47.161
Where's yours?

01:33:47.753 --> 01:33:50.078
- We buried it. L...
- Go dig it up.

01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:54.498
Just back them up and go around it.

01:33:56.929 --> 01:33:58.588
You ain't leaving?

01:33:59.806 --> 01:34:02.594
Four innocent men
are gonna get hung in the morning.

01:34:02.684 --> 01:34:04.724
I'm going back to stop it.

01:34:07.981 --> 01:34:11.184
- Take Billy Joe with you.
- Just do as you're told.

01:34:11.443 --> 01:34:14.942
Don't you understand?
They're gonna be there waiting for us!

01:34:19.785 --> 01:34:21.195
J.D. Cahill.

01:34:23.122 --> 01:34:25.280
Doesn't give a damn about us.

01:34:28.084 --> 01:34:29.116
Back.

01:35:42.117 --> 01:35:43.695
Danny, look out!

01:36:05.224 --> 01:36:07.430
I gave you your chance.
You gotta give me that.

01:36:07.517 --> 01:36:10.851
- I held out my hand in friendship and...
- In a pig's eye, you did.

01:36:10.937 --> 01:36:13.476
You was gonna kill us
the first chance you got.

01:36:13.565 --> 01:36:16.851
The trouble with you, boy,
is that you got no grace.

01:36:17.068 --> 01:36:19.738
You should allow a man his illusions.

01:36:29.665 --> 01:36:30.827
Danny!

01:36:40.676 --> 01:36:41.874
Fraser!

01:37:07.536 --> 01:37:09.279
Danny, are you dead?

01:37:10.289 --> 01:37:12.365
Got the wind knocked out of me.

01:37:12.458 --> 01:37:15.791
Boy, you really had me scared,
lying there like that.

01:37:22.050 --> 01:37:24.588
- Give me that horse.
- We got the money.

01:37:24.886 --> 01:37:26.131
I want him.

01:37:26.221 --> 01:37:29.175
And I want them two boys,
and I want them bad.

01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:33.934
You staked us out, Pa.

01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:37.146
Before you form any lasting judgment
on me...

01:37:37.482 --> 01:37:40.437
it was the only way
I could get Fraser out into the open.

01:37:40.527 --> 01:37:42.319
We almost got killed.

01:37:42.696 --> 01:37:45.863
You could have got killed
robbing that bank, too.

01:37:49.745 --> 01:37:51.204
Are they gone?

01:37:51.413 --> 01:37:52.824
We can't worry about them.

01:37:52.915 --> 01:37:55.405
We have to get back to town
before morning.

01:37:55.667 --> 01:37:57.707
What's gonna happen to us?

01:37:58.503 --> 01:37:59.998
I don't know.

01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:02.996
We'll get a fair trial, won't we?

01:38:03.175 --> 01:38:05.844
Lots of men get a fair trial and hang.

01:38:06.386 --> 01:38:09.422
We were gonna give back
our share of the money.

01:38:09.514 --> 01:38:11.306
I know you were, Son.

01:38:11.934 --> 01:38:13.392
And confess.

01:38:13.477 --> 01:38:15.517
And we did try to stop the killing.

01:38:15.604 --> 01:38:17.810
- I know, Daniel. I wish...
- Pa!

01:38:53.892 --> 01:38:55.801
I'll get the money, Pa.

01:38:57.938 --> 01:38:59.562
Here, Billy Joe.

01:39:01.566 --> 01:39:02.812
Hold it.

01:39:23.338 --> 01:39:25.461
You'd even shoot a dead man!

01:39:25.591 --> 01:39:28.626
No, and I ain't gonna let him
shoot me, neither.

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:29.958
Get up.

01:39:31.471 --> 01:39:32.965
Get me a rope.

01:39:50.824 --> 01:39:52.022
Budger.

01:39:53.744 --> 01:39:55.783
You're bleeding again, Pa.

01:39:56.997 --> 01:39:59.120
I guess it goes with the badge.

01:39:59.208 --> 01:40:01.200
- You got a kerchief?
- Yeah.

01:40:03.462 --> 01:40:06.379
Jam it in this hole. It'll stop the bleeding.

01:40:09.467 --> 01:40:11.128
Here, I'll do it.

01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:19.804
Thank you, Pa.

01:40:21.646 --> 01:40:23.639
Here's the money, all of it.

01:40:23.774 --> 01:40:24.853
Good.

01:40:26.693 --> 01:40:28.021
I hope...

01:40:30.447 --> 01:40:32.735
Now what's gonna happen to us?

01:40:33.408 --> 01:40:36.326
They're gonna be
a little short of witnesses.

01:40:37.329 --> 01:40:40.947
And I can sure testify
that you got the town its money back.

01:40:42.209 --> 01:40:45.412
Do you think
that it'll be reason enough maybe...

01:40:45.503 --> 01:40:48.125
for the judge to put us in your custody?

01:40:48.215 --> 01:40:49.839
I don't know, Son.

01:40:50.050 --> 01:40:51.330
He might.

01:40:51.635 --> 01:40:53.343
But we can't depend on it.

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:58.677
If he does, does that mean
you'll be staying around home more?

01:40:59.351 --> 01:41:01.676
If you'll promise me one thing:

01:41:06.733 --> 01:41:08.357
Don't rob banks.

01:41:14.199 --> 01:41:16.192
Let's go stop a hanging.
