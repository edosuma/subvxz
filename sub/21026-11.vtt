12:53.013 --> 12:54.843
if he can preserve it correctly,

12:54.877 --> 12:57.811
more than a yard

12:57.846 --> 12:59.640
Morgan: This is just
a beautiful piece of fur.

12:59.675 --> 13:01.746
It'd be awful
if it went to waste,

13:01.781 --> 13:04.197
so we got to hurry
and get the job done

13:04.231 --> 13:06.337
before it starts to rot.

13:06.371 --> 13:09.581
I'm hoping to make a rough

13:09.616 --> 13:12.584
The biggest hole in the jacket
is around the hood.

13:12.619 --> 13:14.345
That's where most of the heat
is coming out,

13:14.379 --> 13:16.968
so having a good fur
rough will keep ice

13:17.003 --> 13:19.522
from building up
on my beard so much,

13:19.557 --> 13:24.665
and it'll just seal so much

as much flesh attached

13:26.840 --> 13:28.255

and that'll save me some work
when I'm fleshing later.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.951
And I'm going to aim
to have just one uniform,

13:33.985 --> 13:36.056
square piece of fur,

13:36.091 --> 13:37.851
and it's going to be
the most useful,

13:37.886 --> 13:40.509

getting trimmed off.

13:40.543 --> 13:42.649
That's a nice piece
of fur there.

13:42.683 --> 13:46.239
It's real warm stuff.

13:46.273 --> 13:47.757
Narrator: Stretching the hide

13:47.792 --> 13:49.759
prepares it
for the fleshing process,

13:49.794 --> 13:54.350
which is the most critical step
in preventing rot.

13:54.385 --> 13:57.595
Morgan:
I'm going to stretch it more and
more with more and more tacks,

13:57.629 --> 14:02.289
and then, really, I can start
fleshing it for real.

14:02.324 --> 14:08.019
The flesh is particularly tough
and fibrous, hard to cut,

14:08.054 --> 14:10.850
and it really takes
a lot of work.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.887
This stuff is impossible
to get a hold of.

14:13.922 --> 14:17.615
If there's any flesh or membrane
or oil left on this hide,

14:17.649 --> 14:20.135
when I go to tan it,
it won't tan properly,

14:20.169 --> 14:21.515
and it could rot.

14:21.550 --> 14:24.104
There's a champion
chunk there.

14:24.139 --> 14:27.142
Once I feel like I've gotten all
the major pieces of flesh off,

14:27.176 --> 14:30.662
I'm going to use some salt
on there to dry, uh,

14:30.697 --> 14:31.940
and kind of pull the oil

14:31.974 --> 14:34.045
and the moisture
out of the hide.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.667
And it helps shrink the hide

14:35.702 --> 14:39.913
so it tightens up, and it helps
the fleshy layers kind of start

14:39.948 --> 14:42.847
to flake off
and peel off nicely.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.471
Narrator: To leech out all the
moisture that can spoil a hide,

14:46.506 --> 14:49.750
Morgan will leave the salt
to cure for 24 hours.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.979
If you get them too big,
the little pig is going

15:46.014 --> 15:47.567

15:47.601 --> 15:49.638

16:13.282 --> 16:15.353
any big deal putting them

16:18.529 --> 16:19.944

around up there,

16:19.979 --> 16:23.016

is still ahead --

33:58.484 --> 34:00.659
turning his finest
catch of the season

34:00.693 --> 34:03.351
into a lucrative product
for sale.

34:03.386 --> 34:05.146
Marty: Depending on
how good the fur is,

34:05.181 --> 34:07.390
it could be up to $500 a pelt,

34:07.424 --> 34:09.012
so this is a big deal.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.979
Narrator: And it's another
important learning opportunity

34:11.014 --> 34:13.258
for his daughter, Noah.

34:13.292 --> 34:17.089
I want Noah to realize there's
nothing icky about skinning.

34:17.124 --> 34:19.160
When I lift the wolf up,
I want you to stick

34:19.195 --> 34:20.782
his hind legs
through there.

34:20.817 --> 34:22.094
I'll try.

34:22.129 --> 34:24.786
And don't fall because
your mother will kill me.

34:24.821 --> 34:27.030
[ Grunts ]

34:27.065 --> 34:29.274
-Okay.
-All right. Perfect.

34:29.308 --> 34:31.276
Good job, baby.

34:31.310 --> 34:33.209
I'll get his hind feet going,

34:33.243 --> 34:35.418
and you watch
how I do the toes.

34:35.452 --> 34:37.834
And then, when I start
doing the front feet,

34:37.868 --> 34:40.354
then you start skinning
the hide down.

34:40.388 --> 34:41.803
Okay.

34:41.838 --> 34:46.498
Narrator: To fetch top dollar,
Marty plans every cut carefully.

34:46.532 --> 34:50.018
Marty: Skinning is all about
preserving the fur,

34:50.053 --> 34:52.090
so the less cuts
you make, the better.

34:52.124 --> 34:55.507
Just make one cut
from hind foot through the base

34:55.541 --> 34:57.371
of the tail
to the other hind foot.

34:57.405 --> 35:01.271
The idea is to leave the feet
on just like a glove.

35:01.306 --> 35:03.929
See how it's just kind of
rolling off like a glove?

35:03.963 --> 35:05.172
Uh-huh.

35:05.206 --> 35:07.933
Just work on his back.
Get his back worked down.

35:07.967 --> 35:09.969
-Okay?
-Okay.

35:10.004 --> 35:12.144
Yeah.
You're doing good, baby.

35:12.179 --> 35:16.700
I like working with my papa
because he can show me

35:16.735 --> 35:19.841
how to do stuff I didn't know
how to do before.

35:19.876 --> 35:21.671
How's he look?
Wolf?

35:21.705 --> 35:23.224
It's awesome.

35:23.259 --> 35:25.192
Narrator: While Marty still
faces an uphill battle

35:25.226 --> 35:27.194
to turn a profit this season,

35:27.228 --> 35:31.819
a $500 wolf skin is a step
in the right direction.

35:31.853 --> 35:35.271
Catching a wolf is really great
because they are sharp.

35:35.305 --> 35:38.377
Best you can do as a trapper
is to catch a wolf.

35:38.412 --> 35:41.829
Hopefully, my season
starts getting better.

35:41.863 --> 35:47.006

Brent: It's extremely hard to
light a fire in this climate.

36:11.583 --> 36:15.000
Narrator: More than 60 inches of
rain fall here every winter,

36:15.034 --> 36:17.727
soaking the island's wood

Brent scores the wet outer wood

Brent: These are nice and dry.

37:19.167 --> 37:20.686
I think one of the biggest
lessons I'm learning

is what the difference

37:22.585 --> 37:24.828
is between what you want

You need food, water, shelter.

with how it came out,

38:08.700 --> 38:11.185

Narrator: Scraped, salted, and
cured, the prize wolverine pelt

38:14.533 --> 38:17.329

The only frostbite I've ever

38:25.820 --> 38:27.926

38:27.960 --> 38:30.204
if I'd had a fur rough
on my parka.

38:30.238 --> 38:32.310
You know, the wind wouldn't
have blown in there.

38:32.344 --> 38:35.485
Narrator:
A proper rough should create
a nearly airtight seal around

38:35.520 --> 38:37.901
the face to minimize
the amount of cold air

I've got a lot of work and a lot
of time into this wolverine,

another one anytime soon.

before I start cutting into it,

on both sides
of the hood opening.

39:30.091 --> 39:33.750
So I'm actually going to cut
it well inside of that line

39:33.785 --> 39:36.374

39:42.863 --> 39:45.590
If you use scissors
and just start cutting the fur,

39:45.624 --> 39:46.970
you'll cut a bunch of the fur,

There'll be enough fur there,

40:15.309 --> 40:17.000
and I think the fur
is supple enough,

40:17.035 --> 40:19.762
it'll follow the curve
of the jacket.

40:19.796 --> 40:23.317
Going to pin it on here,
check it for fit.

40:26.320 --> 40:30.082
It feels really warm.

attached so it can be added

to the weather.
