1948
01:33:26.899 --> 01:33:29.776
So if it's real

1949
01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:33.197
Then, darlin', let me know

If you steal the show

1953
01:33:43.290 --> 01:33:45.501
You shine

1954
01:33:45.584 --> 01:33:47.961
You shine

1955
01:33:48.045 --> 01:33:49.463
Like forever

1956
01:33:50.589 --> 01:33:51.840
Lasts forever

1957
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:56.094
You shine

1958
01:33:56.178 --> 01:33:59.389
You shine and steal the show

If you steal the show

Started out on a one-way train

1966

Always knew where
I was gonna go next

So if it's real

1968
01:34:25.457 --> 01:34:27.209
Didn't know until I saw your face

1969
01:34:27.334 --> 01:34:30.587
Then, darlin', let me know

1970
01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:32.673
You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two

1971
01:34:33.257 --> 01:34:34.508
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?

1972
01:34:34.591 --> 01:34:37.553
I wouldn't mind

1973
