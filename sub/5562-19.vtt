00:33.134 --> 00:34.199
(whimpering)

00:34.702 --> 00:36.468
(grunting)

00:36.470 --> 00:38.437
(door opening)

00:47.581 --> 00:50.649
(indistinct chatter)

00:58.125 --> 00:59.458
Could you get it off?

00:59.460 --> 01:03.362
No.
There's no way.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.497
I can't do this.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.799
Then we run.

01:06.801 --> 01:09.234
We get away.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.239
This way. Now.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.709
(grunts)

01:26.821 --> 01:28.420
(grunting)

01:37.198 --> 01:39.865
This way!
No! Karim!

01:42.770 --> 01:44.136
(tires screeching)

01:44.138 --> 01:45.571
(explosion)

01:45.573 --> 01:47.706
Karim!

01:54.215 --> 01:55.881
(sirens blaring)

01:58.652 --> 02:01.220

02:14.635 --> 02:16.502
¶ ¶

02:20.407 --> 02:21.707
Kensi:
You have a home office.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.308
Deeks: Yeah, you don't
need a home office.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.310
It's just another room
for you to mess up.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.745
I'm-- maybe an extra
bedroom then,

02:26.747 --> 02:28.313
For, like,
your mom or something.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.848
That's your argument?
A bedroom for my mom?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.750
I'm just saying, if we're on
top of each other all the time,

02:31.752 --> 02:33.452
This isn't gonna work.
Okay, that's interesting,

02:33.454 --> 02:35.721
'cause I think we do our best
work on top of each other.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.290
Hey, we're at work.
No sex talk.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.291
You want coffee?

02:39.293 --> 02:40.826
No, no coffee for me.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.360
Besides, it doesn't matter.
Hetty's not even here.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.729
We can talk about sex
as much as we want.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.897
What are you
talking about?

02:44.899 --> 02:48.367
Hetty is everywhere.
You know that.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.435
Um...

02:50.437 --> 02:53.705
So you-you think we need
a bigger place?

02:53.707 --> 02:55.774
Well, I mean, it wouldn't be
my place or your place.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.209
It would just kind of be...

02:57.211 --> 02:58.877
Our place.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.480
Is there, um...

03:01.482 --> 03:04.316
Something you want to tell me?

03:04.318 --> 03:05.584
No.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.353
I just saw it,
and I decided to buy it.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.688
Oh.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.690
Damn cute baby.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.425
And I get it,
it's a natural instinct.

03:13.427 --> 03:16.461
And as the relationship
progresses, we...

03:16.463 --> 03:19.531
Right, and you have
your little brother program.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.333
Oh, the-the fost-foster...

03:21.335 --> 03:23.669
Yeah, no, I definitely... I...
You can do that, too, though.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.204
Hang out with
a foster kid.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.538
You should do...
I mean, that's...

03:26.540 --> 03:28.407
I mean, obviously, it's
not as big a commitment

03:28.409 --> 03:30.509
As-as this would be.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.710
Right.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.978
Eric:
Ops.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.947
Stat-- there's been
an explosion downtown.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.818
Um...

03:48.862 --> 03:52.531
At 9:14 there was an explosion
at the southwest corner

03:52.533 --> 03:54.566
Of pershing square.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.535
Fbi asked callen and
sam to the scene.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.403
Do we know why the fbi
asked for our help?

03:58.405 --> 04:00.155
Not yet.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.906
So is it terrorist attack,
or is it a gas leak?

04:01.909 --> 04:02.908
Eric: No one's
confirmed anything.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.510
We're looking
at security cams.

04:05.512 --> 04:08.413
There's no clear angle
of the explosion.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.415
What about outliers
on other cameras?

04:10.417 --> 04:11.783
Way ahead of you.
It's morning downtown,

04:11.785 --> 04:14.786
So the outliers
are these two boys.

04:15.990 --> 04:16.922
Looks like
they're being chased

04:16.924 --> 04:19.391
By these men.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.692
Can you get any tighter?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.527
Yeah.
(rapid typing)

04:25.432 --> 04:27.499
They're twins.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.568
I know, they look
11 or 12.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.737
Could these boys be the bombers?

04:31.739 --> 04:33.905
Deeks: They're caucasian--
could be

04:33.907 --> 04:35.474
Domestic terrorism.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.509
What about the guys
chasing them?

04:37.511 --> 04:39.645
Facial-rec is running.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.046
Maybe they're not
involved at all.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.498
Maybe they know something

04:42.499 --> 04:43.949
And the guys are just preventing
them from warning people.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.384
Yeah, but they're kids
and it's a school day.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.618
Like, what are they
doing down there?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.270
Kensi: I mean, if one
of them was carrying

04:48.271 --> 04:49.921
The bomb that exploded,
that would mean...

04:49.923 --> 04:51.023
He's dead.

04:51.025 --> 04:55.861
Call us when you find
the other boy.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.602
(indistinct chatter)

05:11.945 --> 05:13.545
Agents hanna, callen.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.514
Agent rand,
I wish we were seeing you

05:15.516 --> 05:16.815
Under different circumstances.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.484
This one is
particularly bad.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.585
What do you have?

05:20.587 --> 05:22.788
Witnesses saw
the car hit the boy,

05:22.790 --> 05:23.855
And the accident triggered
some sort of explosion.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.028
Well, from the location
of the blast,

05:30.030 --> 05:32.464
It wasn't the car's gas tank.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.502
Kid must have been rigged
with the explosives.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.737
Techs say they found

05:38.739 --> 05:40.772
Shrapnel and remnants
of what appears to be

05:40.774 --> 05:42.908
A suicide vest.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.877
The m.E. Puts the boy's age
at around 11 years old.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.914
11-year-old suicide bomber?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.048
I know. I...

05:50.050 --> 05:52.551
I have an
11-year-old son.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.823
All right, we're happy to help.
Why'd you call us?

05:57.825 --> 06:00.692
Initial tests indicate that the
explosive was made of binetex.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.562
Binetex isn't on the streets.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.264
Exactly.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.965
And you worked a binetex case
with atf in November.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.700
And atf said
they recovered all of it.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.702
Well, not so much.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.904
Looks like the circuit
had a wireless receiver.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.005
Also found parts

06:14.007 --> 06:16.041
Of a smartphone.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.943
I've seen this before.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.579
The phone acts
as a dead man's switch.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.781
If it can detect changes
in anything it monitors--

06:22.783 --> 06:25.450
Kaboom-- bomb goes off.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.918
What kind of changes
are we talking about?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.086
Anything,
pick an app.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.555
Change the gps,
change of altitude...

06:30.557 --> 06:31.957
It explodes.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.458
Sam: It ensures
even if the bomber

06:33.460 --> 06:35.527
Doesn't pull the trigger,
the bomb still goes off.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.597
It means the kid
was forced to do it.

06:38.599 --> 06:41.867
I have other witnesses that say
that he was with another child.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.737
He could be wearing a vest, too.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.973
Kensi:
<i> This is downtown los angeles.</i>

06:47.975 --> 06:50.575
This kid has to show up
on a camera somewhere.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.110
We lose him one block
from the explosion.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.646
Got a hit on one of the men
from pershing square.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.648
Name is
pritam mondal.

06:56.650 --> 07:00.118
Cia believes he is a member
of al-qaeda, operating out of...

07:00.120 --> 07:01.486
India?

07:01.488 --> 07:03.588
These kids don't
look indian.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.691
Nell: Just got a facial-rec
hit on one of the boys.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.427
He's israeli.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.595
His name
is tomar zahavi.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.864
He's a son of
david and rachel zahavi.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.467
Nell: Okay, david zahavi
he's an israeli diplomat.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.935
He's been
to the united states

07:16.937 --> 07:19.638
Seven times
in the last four years.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.839
Where is he now?

07:20.841 --> 07:22.007
Eric:
Um... Tel aviv.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.475
I want to talk to him.

07:23.477 --> 07:24.643
It's 9:00 there.

07:24.645 --> 07:28.146
Wake him up if you have to.
Okay.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.850
I'm running
a svtc connection

07:31.852 --> 07:33.218
Through
the state department.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.188
That way, he'll know
we are who we say we are.

07:36.190 --> 07:39.024
David zahavi:
Please identify yourself.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.725
Nell:
David sahavi,

07:40.727 --> 07:43.662
This is the ncis office of
special projects in los angeles.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.897
I have special agent
kensi blye for you.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.233
I would like a visual.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.503
Mr. Zahavi, I'm special
agent kensi blye.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.771
Is this about the explosion?

07:52.773 --> 07:54.172
Yes.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.674
I'm watching
news coverage of it now.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.708
Was it a bomb?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.643
It was a bomb.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.745
And there's no easy way
to say this,

08:00.747 --> 08:02.747
But your son
may have been involved.

08:02.749 --> 08:05.784
My son, tomar?
He's 11 years old.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.619
I'm lapd detective
martin deeks.

08:07.621 --> 08:11.022
Uh, is your son
in los angeles?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.592
No, of course not.
He's here with me.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.993
(sighs)

08:14.995 --> 08:17.262
This is absurd.
You don't believe me?

08:17.264 --> 08:20.765
Just for clarification,
your son is with you right now?

08:20.767 --> 08:22.067
Is tomar still awake?

08:22.069 --> 08:23.502
(woman speaking hebrew)

08:23.504 --> 08:25.103
Just bring him in here.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.652
He looks just like
the other two boys.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.921
Yeah, except
he's 7,000 miles away.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.702
Is the israeli boy related?

08:57.704 --> 08:59.971
Eric: We're still trying
to locate birth records,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.823
But according to tax records,

09:01.824 --> 09:03.674
Tomar is david and
rachel zahavi's only son.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.777
Granger:
So he's just a doppelganger

09:05.779 --> 09:07.212
Who has nothing
to do with this?

09:07.213 --> 09:08.646
Granger, the boys at
the site looked like twins.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.850
Lot of twins and triplets coming
out of fertility clinics.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.318
Just got a hit
on the boy from the park.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.587
He is six blocks away
from callen and sam.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.188
Get them his gps.
Blye, deeks--

09:17.190 --> 09:20.759
Find out if there's a connection
between the three boys, got it.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.961
Any way the zahavis had other
kids that weren't documented?

09:22.963 --> 09:24.596
Unless the dad
was hiding something,

09:24.598 --> 09:25.764
He would have mentioned it.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.033
They'd have to be
identical triplets.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.701
Which would be rare.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.969
That would mean the zahavis

09:30.971 --> 09:32.737
Gave up two of their
boys for adoption.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.873
I'm still trying to locate the
hospital where tomar was born.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.974
It shouldn't be
this difficult.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.643
It just seems odd
that they would have

09:38.645 --> 09:40.078
Given up two of their boys.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.681
A mother's instinct?

09:42.683 --> 09:44.649
(sighs)
yeah.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.718
Something like that.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.121
Give us everything
you have on tomar zahavi.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.657
Social media, photos,
school records--

09:52.659 --> 09:54.225
On the back screen, please.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.827
Eric:
Coming at you.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.195
(beeping)

10:03.604 --> 10:07.072
Looks like a pretty
happy childhood.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.907
Yeah, but having kids

10:08.909 --> 10:11.776
Means the end of
a lot of amazing things.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.379
Like our partnership?

10:14.381 --> 10:17.248
I don't know if I'd make
a very good stay-at-home dad.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.301
Sam has kids.

10:19.302 --> 10:21.353
Yeah, michelle had to leave
the cia because of those kids.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.721
So what are you saying?

10:22.723 --> 10:24.689
That it's just
not gonna happen at all?

10:24.691 --> 10:25.790
I didn't say that.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.259
Having kids
is also the beginning

10:28.261 --> 10:30.261
Of some amazing things.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.163
So what does that mean?
What are you saying?

10:32.165 --> 10:33.765
I don't know.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.036
Are we sure
we want to go here?

10:38.038 --> 10:39.904
I think we're already here.
How did that happen?

10:39.906 --> 10:41.039
(chuckles)

10:41.041 --> 10:42.340
You know, like,
we woke up this morning,

10:42.342 --> 10:43.341
And we were not here.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.176
I know.
Definitely not here.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.845
And all of a sudden,
we are very much here.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.751
(chuckles)

10:52.753 --> 10:56.287
The zahavis are well off,
they're married,

10:56.289 --> 10:58.823
And they're established.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.992
Which means, even if they
weren't expecting triplets...

11:00.994 --> 11:02.994
They would never give up
any of their kids.

11:02.996 --> 11:07.832
Because the truth is...
Those kids would be

11:07.834 --> 11:10.001
The most important thing
in the world to them.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.675
(siren blaring)

11:16.677 --> 11:18.143
We're here, eric.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.778
All right, he went
inside the building,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.279
Got on the elevator,
heading up,

11:21.281 --> 11:22.414
19 minutes ago.

11:22.416 --> 11:25.216
Nell:
And he got off at the top floor.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.286
(indistinct conversations)

11:32.726 --> 11:35.260
(elevator bell dings)

11:44.271 --> 11:46.805
¶ ¶

11:46.807 --> 11:48.139
You seeing anything?

11:48.141 --> 11:50.241
I got an audiologist,

11:50.243 --> 11:51.810
An accountant,
an insurance company...

11:51.812 --> 11:53.812
I got an employment agency
and escrow company.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.413
If he doesn't know anybody
up here and he needs to hide...

11:55.415 --> 11:57.148
Why's he coming
to the top floor?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.784
He didn't, he went to the roof.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.330
¶ ¶

12:22.809 --> 12:24.008
I got nothing.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.244
Okay. He doesn't
want to detonate the bomb.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.113
First thing I'd do
is take off the vest off.

12:28.115 --> 12:31.282
Well, fbi and lapd are
combing the area with dogs.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.851
They haven't found a vest.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.286
Maybe he can't
take the vest off.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.122
Then he'd want to deactivate it.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.357
How?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.929
And if he's a smart boy,

12:44.931 --> 12:47.165
He'd try to submerge it
in water.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.450
How you doing?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.552
I'm a federal agent.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.320
Not gonna hurt you.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.323
My name is callen.
What's your name?

13:12.325 --> 13:14.325
Nadir.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.527
Nadir.

13:15.529 --> 13:18.396
How you doing, nadir?

13:18.398 --> 13:21.065
I'm going to come down
there, all right?

13:21.067 --> 13:22.300
You're going to kill me.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.334
No, no, I'm here to help.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.120
I see your gun.

13:25.121 --> 13:26.905
I'm not going
to bring my gun, okay?

13:26.907 --> 13:28.306
Not going to bring it.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.375
G, I should be in there.
Let me try

13:30.377 --> 13:32.143
And talk him down-- I might be
a little less intimating.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.449
Here.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.553
All right, nadir.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.588
No gun, okay?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.156
I'm coming down.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.459
Eric, I need the bomb squad now.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.030
Stay away from me.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.966
I'm not going to hurt you,
just want to talk.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.335
How's the water
down there?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.337
It's very, very cold.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.406
You like to swim, nadir?

14:01.408 --> 14:04.275
I've never swam before.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.377
Really?

14:06.379 --> 14:09.848
Ooh! Yeah. That's cold.

14:09.850 --> 14:15.086
You never swam, but you
came down into this water.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.288
That's pretty brave of you.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.858
Don't come any closer.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.427
I know why
you're in here.

14:22.429 --> 14:26.497
You have a bomb vest
on you, is that right?

14:26.499 --> 14:30.134
My clothes...
For my trip to heaven.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.972
Look, I can get
some experts down here

14:33.974 --> 14:35.640
That can safely
take that off you, all right?

14:35.642 --> 14:36.608
Nobody's touching me.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.077
We just want to help.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.847
You are the great satan,

14:41.848 --> 14:44.616
And I would rather destroy us
both than let you touch my body.

14:44.618 --> 14:48.386
We're just going to take off
the vest, that's all.

14:48.388 --> 14:52.156
Your touch will prevent me from
entering the kingdom of heaven.

14:52.158 --> 14:55.026
And I will die
before I let that happen.

14:56.363 --> 15:00.465
All I have to do
is lift my thumb off the phone.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.347
(sirens wailing)

15:22.222 --> 15:23.922
The kid's wearing
a bomb vest.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.223
He's up inside
the roof's water tank.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.591
He was trying
to deactivate it.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.927
Get the street shut down,
get lapd to clear out

15:28.929 --> 15:30.194
This building first
and then work outward

15:30.196 --> 15:31.162
To all the surrounding
buildings.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.163
Yes, ma'am.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.998
Callen's with him
in the tank.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.600
He's trying
to talk him down.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.069
I want one agent to go up there
and support callen.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.304
I don't want swat
spooking this kid.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.338
I'll do it.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.674
Hold on.
You sure?

15:42.676 --> 15:45.060
That bomb goes off...

15:45.061 --> 15:47.445
If I can't save this child,
then why am I doing this job?

15:49.082 --> 15:50.648
Where are you going?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.600
I'm going back to the site.

15:52.601 --> 15:54.551
I need to find out if this bomb
is still viable.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.573
Deeks:
<i> So tomar's birth certificate</i>

15:58.574 --> 16:00.958
From israel says he was
born in mumbai, india.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.428
But on all the documents
from the indian government

16:03.430 --> 16:05.096
The birth mother's name's
been redacted.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.197
I actually
read about this.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.099
There's a lot of couples
going to india

16:08.101 --> 16:09.167
'cause of the lower
cost of surrogacy.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.219
Well, that tracks.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.270
The men from the park are
part of an indian al-qaeda cell.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.374
(typing)

16:16.376 --> 16:19.410
And according
to the airline records,

16:19.412 --> 16:22.347
The zahavis traveled to india
two days after the birth.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.181
So what about mumbai hospitals?

16:23.183 --> 16:24.615
I'll check
with eric.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.417
I mean, there has to be some
sort of record or indication

16:26.419 --> 16:27.986
Of who adopted the other boys.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.254
That would explain why david
didn't say anything.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.358
I mean, he probably didn't know
the other babies were even born.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.729
Okay, eric already checked.

16:37.731 --> 16:40.531
No record of tomar zahavi
in mumbai hospitals.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.700
Well, somebody could have
erased the records.
Or the surrogate

16:42.702 --> 16:44.669
Could have given birth
in another city in india.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.204
Or could have had a home birth.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.272
That's what I would do.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.641
What?
You-you wouldn't want

16:50.643 --> 16:52.176
The support
of a trained professional

16:52.178 --> 16:54.245
In case anything goes wrong?
Please, women have

16:54.247 --> 16:55.713
Been giving birth for millions
of years without doctors.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.648
I think I can handle it.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.384
You think that you could...
Wow. Are we really...

16:59.386 --> 17:00.618
Are we really having
this conversation?

17:00.620 --> 17:02.253
Seems like you are.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.755
Why would I want to put
our child in danger?

17:03.757 --> 17:07.358
I'm just saying that a hospital
is a safer place to have a kid.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.360
That's funny, I thought
we weren't having a kid.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.328
I never said that.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.295
(computer beeps)

17:11.297 --> 17:13.131
Hold please.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.366
No records on tomar zahavi
in any hospital in india.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.335
Granger:
Well, there must have been

17:17.337 --> 17:19.470
A doctor in mumbai
who handled the surrogacy.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.440
Okay, I will look into
fertility clinics in mumbai.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.308
What's your view on,
uh, circumcision?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.410
I don't know.
You go first.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.377
I think that mutilating--

17:26.379 --> 17:28.246
Answer that and you're fired.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.485
(indistinct radio transmissions)

17:34.487 --> 17:36.554
(distant siren wails)

17:36.556 --> 17:38.289
Look at this circuit.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.491
See the way it's
covered in oxide?

17:40.493 --> 17:43.327
That means it was coated
with silicone.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.296
It was heated
during the explosion

17:45.298 --> 17:46.631
And then turned to oxide.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.232
Yeah.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.500
You hear that, g?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.335
Yeah, it's covered in silicone.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.371
That means water won't
interfere with the circuit.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.173
The bomb is still viable.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.307
Got it.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.509
Look, nadir...

17:58.511 --> 18:00.445
My partner is telling me

18:00.447 --> 18:02.613
That submerging
that vest in water

18:02.615 --> 18:05.650
Is not going to stop
the bomb from exploding.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.454
How do you know that?

18:09.456 --> 18:13.825
Because we can talk
to each other through this.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.428
How does he know?

18:17.430 --> 18:22.300
Because he's looking at what's
left of the bomb that...

18:22.302 --> 18:24.368
That killed your brother.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.607
Look, I'm sorry.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.481
He was my twin.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.816
I know.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.486
I can't live without him.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.187
Yes, you can.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.623
I know what it's like to be
out in the world alone.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.625
I never knew my parents.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.460
I didn't even
really meet my mom.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.129
I didn't even know

18:51.131 --> 18:52.463
My first name until--

18:52.465 --> 18:54.465
I don't care about your name.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.802
My brother died today.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.571
I understand.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.575
Karim was all I had.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.445
My parents abandoned us.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.880
Nadir...

19:08.882 --> 19:13.417
I get it. You gotta
trust me on that, oaky?

19:13.419 --> 19:16.721
Now, what do you
say I bring

19:16.723 --> 19:19.257
Someone in here that can
safely take that vest off you?

19:19.259 --> 19:21.443
I-I-I know
that's what you want.

19:21.444 --> 19:23.628
And then I will find the people
that killed your brother.

19:23.630 --> 19:27.365
They didn't kill my brother.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.733
They sent him to heaven.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.268
That's just not true.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.387
My parents were devils

19:32.388 --> 19:34.505
Who didn't even care
about their own children.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.841
They left us
for dead.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.277
But that doesn't mean
that you have to die.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.679
If I wasn't holding this,
I would be dead now.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.581
Tell me that isn't true.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.752
I don't shoot children.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.954
Your country
<i> has</i> killed children.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.722
You can't deny it.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.592
Innocent children,
in their homes.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.827
So why not me?

19:56.829 --> 19:58.629
Tell me.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.600
Tell me!

20:03.570 --> 20:05.970
All right, we're looking
for a doctor named yatin baral,

20:05.972 --> 20:07.805
An o.B. Practicing
out of mumbai, india.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.574
He's a fertility specialist.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.510
And the clinic connects
surrogates in india

20:12.512 --> 20:14.579
To couples in australia,
america...

20:14.581 --> 20:15.580
England, France...

20:15.582 --> 20:16.781
And israel.

20:16.782 --> 20:17.981
Make sure callen and sam
are getting this.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.750
Callen:
Keep going. I'm listening.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.985
I'm hearing it.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.854
Nell:
The human rights commission

20:22.855 --> 20:24.722
Has opened an investigation
into dr. Baral.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.259
It seems he's accused of
impregnating very young women

20:28.261 --> 20:30.528
With many more embryos
than is ethical

20:30.530 --> 20:32.830
Or safe for the girls
to carry to full term.

20:32.832 --> 20:36.667
Eric:
And the indian central bureau
of investigation also has a case

20:36.669 --> 20:39.570
Against dr. Baral, for selling
babies on the black market.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.372
So he impregnates young women
with multiple eggs,

20:41.374 --> 20:42.991
They carry to term...

20:42.992 --> 20:44.609
Granger:
And he gives the parents
one of the children.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.843
And then the son of a bitch

20:45.845 --> 20:47.845
Sells the rest
on the black market.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.747
He could be selling to other
couples who want babies.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.882
Use for child labor.

20:51.884 --> 20:55.019
Or he raises them to be human
bombs in the united states.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.874
How certain
are we about this?

21:16.876 --> 21:18.509
Deeks:
About the boys being related?

21:18.511 --> 21:20.378
I mean, based on the photos,
I'd put money on it.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.346
M.E. Is sending dna
from the bomb blast

21:22.348 --> 21:23.848
To the fbi crime lab.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.516
The zahavis
also sent their son's dna,

21:25.518 --> 21:26.884
And it's being processed now.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.819
And how long
till we get the results?

21:28.821 --> 21:30.955
You don't have time
to wait, agent callen.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.991
Proceed as if we're right
on this, for your own sake.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.831
Nadir, I need you
to listen to me.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.300
You were not abandoned.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.902
Your parents did not
give you up.

21:44.904 --> 21:47.972
You don't know
anything about me.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.674
Well, actually, I do.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.410
I have my people looking
into your background.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.446
I know who
your parents are.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.782
They didn't care
about me and my brother,

21:57.784 --> 21:59.083
So I don't care about them.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.351
Nadir, it's much more

22:00.353 --> 22:01.652
Complicated than that.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.487
They left us
on the street

22:03.489 --> 22:06.023
To die--
what's complicated about that?

22:06.025 --> 22:07.491
That is not true.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.861
Your mom and dad
didn't know you were born.

22:10.863 --> 22:13.698
How can a mother give birth
and not know about her son?

22:13.700 --> 22:16.600
Your mom was not able
to carry a baby,

22:16.602 --> 22:18.602
But your mom and dad
really wanted children.

22:18.604 --> 22:21.872
So your mom and dad's dna
was put into another woman,

22:21.874 --> 22:25.543
And she gave birth to you
and your brother.

22:27.814 --> 22:30.014
What's dna?

22:30.016 --> 22:31.882
Deeks:
Callen, this kid was raised

22:31.884 --> 22:34.652
In isolation-- he has
no reference for any of this.

22:34.654 --> 22:38.356
Tell me now, why I shouldn't
take my thumb off this phone.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.357
Nadir, just hear me out, okay?

22:39.359 --> 22:40.491
Sam:
We got a problem.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.893
The cell phone
is a dead man' switch,

22:42.895 --> 22:46.030
And as soon as the battery
runs down, the bomb goes off.

22:48.801 --> 22:49.934
I'm going to need
some help down here.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.669
Sam:
Okay, hold tight.

22:54.574 --> 22:57.675
Kensi, get me the parents.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.947
So there is
nothing concrete

23:02.949 --> 23:06.417
That says dr. Baral
actually did this?
Kensi: No, mrs. Zahavi,

23:06.419 --> 23:08.786
But you saw the pictures.
There are a lot
of people

23:08.788 --> 23:10.955
In this world who look alike.
There are

23:10.957 --> 23:12.990
Agents' lives on the line here.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.893
(sighs)

23:15.895 --> 23:17.495
We'll do whatever we can,

23:17.497 --> 23:19.764
But at this point, we're not
getting our son involved.

23:19.766 --> 23:23.000
He doesn't even know
he was born from a surrogate.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.004
Um, listen,
there's no halfway on this.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.840
You have to make sure
he believes you're his parents.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.609
We understand.

23:35.815 --> 23:36.981
It's coming down.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.150
(grunts)

23:39.152 --> 23:40.951
Who's that?

23:40.953 --> 23:42.953
That is my partner

23:42.955 --> 23:44.822
And my friend.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.824
What are you doing?

23:46.826 --> 23:49.126
You might not understand
what I've been telling you,

23:49.128 --> 23:51.862
So there's somebody I want
you to talk to. Eric, we good?

23:51.864 --> 23:53.697
You're on.

23:53.699 --> 23:56.033
Nadir,

23:56.035 --> 23:59.036
I want you to meet your parents.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.938
Hello, nadir.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.942
I'm david. I am your
biological father.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.011
And I am your mother.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.914
Please let the men
take that vest off you.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.982
Prove it.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.584
We're running
a test now,

24:13.586 --> 24:15.920
But we do believe
that you are...
Believe?

24:15.922 --> 24:18.022
Believe what?

24:18.024 --> 24:20.157
That you are our son.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.993
How do you know?

24:22.995 --> 24:25.729
Because...

24:25.731 --> 24:27.798
You have another brother.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.066
A twin.

24:29.068 --> 24:32.069
Or a-a triplet,
I guess.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.204
Let me see him.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.042
Where is he?

24:38.044 --> 24:39.743
Why doesn't he talk to me?

24:40.713 --> 24:42.713
Uh...

24:42.715 --> 24:44.048
I don't want to do that.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.250
It's-it's a lot
for him to understand.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.819
But for me it's okay?

24:48.821 --> 24:51.021
No, it's not, but you're
in a bad situation.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.823
I'm trying to help.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.492
(beep)

24:54.494 --> 24:56.760
The dna results are back.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.997
Callen, dna tests are in.

24:59.999 --> 25:03.000
It's confirmed.
They're brothers.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.669
David, rachel,
we have the results.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.505
Nadir is your son.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.840
Rachel:
You're sure?
100%.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.642
Rachel:
Oh, my god.

25:11.644 --> 25:14.111
Nadir, you are our son.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.046
Please let them take
that vest off of you.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.982
Please, I'm begging you.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.016
I don't believe you.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.784
Y-you say a test came back.

25:20.786 --> 25:23.153
How do I know
that means anything?

25:23.155 --> 25:25.222
We're running out of time.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.757
But we can show you
the-the results.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.759
The-the test, it-it
compares your...

25:28.761 --> 25:30.694
It's just words.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.898
They're gone. Where did they go?

25:33.900 --> 25:36.667
David? Rachel?

25:36.669 --> 25:38.068
Guys?

25:38.070 --> 25:39.603
Eric:
Mr. Zahavi.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.573
Uh, guys,
I don't know what happened.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.879
Nadir,

25:48.881 --> 25:51.215
I want you to meet
your brother.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.083
His name is tomar.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.156
You're my brother.

26:00.126 --> 26:03.260
And you are mine.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.763
It's true.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.097
David:
Yes, it is.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.632
I promise you,
we didn't abandon you.

26:08.634 --> 26:10.167
We will never abandon you.

26:10.169 --> 26:13.771
Please, take this off me.
Please.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.239
Sam,

26:15.241 --> 26:17.875
Get the bomb techs
down here now.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.112
¶ ¶

26:30.590 --> 26:32.990
That's good.
That's all we need.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.264
(grunts)

26:40.266 --> 26:42.232
Here you go.
Step up on the blocks.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.270
(exhales)

26:47.974 --> 26:50.107
That's not good.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.625
Sam: That's a second
dead man's switch.

26:51.626 --> 26:53.142
Bomb tech: It's sending
a wireless signal

26:53.145 --> 26:55.245
To the phone
that's monitoring his pulse.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.081
Bomb tech:
If it's removed

26:57.083 --> 26:58.349
Or if something
happens to him,

26:58.351 --> 27:01.051
Causing his pulse
to slow or stop,

27:01.053 --> 27:02.219
The bomb will go off.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.255
C-can you still get it off?

27:05.257 --> 27:06.790
Sam:
Yes.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.793
These men are the best
in the world at this.

27:10.763 --> 27:13.664
Nadir, the men
who put this vest

27:13.666 --> 27:15.265
On you,
d-do you know where they live?

27:15.267 --> 27:16.266
Do you know their address?

27:16.268 --> 27:18.268
I'm not from here.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.871
We only came from india
two weeks ago,

27:20.873 --> 27:24.241
And they forced us
to stay inside the house.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.777
Do you remember any buildings,
any-any landmarks?

27:26.779 --> 27:29.847
A-a park, a store. Anything?

27:30.850 --> 27:34.184
We were close
to a football stadium.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.987
Football. Soccer?

27:36.989 --> 27:38.122
All he knows is soccer.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.257
Anaheim, dodger stadium,

27:40.259 --> 27:42.259
The forum.
Was it covered

27:42.261 --> 27:43.794
Or open-air?

27:43.795 --> 27:45.328
Open, but it was
a football stadium.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.665
And do you remember
any other details about it?

27:48.434 --> 27:51.068
It was big.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.871
There were

27:53.873 --> 27:56.006
These... Circles.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.142
One on top of another.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.246
Olympic rings.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.181
The coliseum.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.683
On it.

28:05.685 --> 28:08.252
We can't disarm it.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.921
If we interrupt the circuit,
it'll go off.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.322
(sighs)

28:12.324 --> 28:15.192
If we take it off
and try and detonate it...

28:15.194 --> 28:18.162
It'll sense his pulse stopped
and it'll go off.

28:19.899 --> 28:22.266
Am I going to die?

28:25.237 --> 28:26.770
(beeping)

28:26.772 --> 28:28.772
All right,
comparing cell phone records

28:28.774 --> 28:30.441
From pershing square
at the time of the bombing

28:30.443 --> 28:33.811
To cell phone records from
the towers near the coliseum,

28:33.813 --> 28:36.146
We've got... Five matches.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.782
Kensi: And one burn phone
that only made four calls.

28:38.784 --> 28:40.250
Three from pershing square
this morning

28:40.252 --> 28:41.919
And one from an address
near the coliseum.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.454
Have fbi meet us there.

28:43.456 --> 28:45.456
Sam, we have an address.

28:45.458 --> 28:48.492
Execute with extreme prejudice.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.261
I have to go.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.730
Bomb tech:
Lucky you.

28:52.732 --> 28:53.897
Send in my guys.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.966
Will do.

28:57.336 --> 29:00.137
Wh-where is he going?

29:00.139 --> 29:02.139
Is everybody leaving?
Nadir,

29:02.141 --> 29:03.273
Look at me.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.908
I'm not leaving.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.510
Everything's gonna be okay.
I promise you.

29:06.512 --> 29:09.213
I will be with you
the whole time.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.152
(engine revving)

29:16.088 --> 29:18.155
(tires screech)

29:18.991 --> 29:20.858
Landlord's in
the back house.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.326
He's been contacted
and vacated.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.795
Radar says there are four
targets on the bottom floor

29:24.797 --> 29:26.263
And four or more
on the top.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.065
All right, we pulled
the city permits.

29:28.067 --> 29:30.367
We got two staircases
to the second floor.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.770
Back one is gonna be tough,
because

29:32.772 --> 29:34.972
It's a single man.

29:34.973 --> 29:37.173
All right, I'll take it
with my team.
All right. The most cover

29:37.176 --> 29:38.909
Is to go from this house
over the fence

29:38.911 --> 29:39.994
Into the backyard.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.078
We got two teams in the front,
one in the back.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.412
Swat's ready to roll.

29:42.414 --> 29:43.781
Well, let's do this.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.382
(grunts)

29:45.384 --> 29:48.385
¶ ¶

30:04.870 --> 30:06.804
In position.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.405
Execute,

30:08.407 --> 30:10.474
Execute, execute.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.453
Federal agents!
Freeze! Stop! Don't move!

30:23.455 --> 30:25.422
Federal agents! Drop
that weapon! Drop that weapon!

30:25.424 --> 30:27.124
Get down on your knees.
Down on your knees.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.359
Down on your knees!

30:29.361 --> 30:31.461
You strap a bomb to a child
but not so willing to die

30:31.463 --> 30:33.263
Yourself, huh?

30:38.304 --> 30:40.337
Agent:
Clear. Clear.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.441
Federal agents!

30:48.380 --> 30:50.180
Stay away from us!

30:54.553 --> 30:56.620
Deeks,

30:56.622 --> 31:00.157
Get everybody out of the house

31:00.159 --> 31:03.093
And clear
the surrounding homes.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.163
You heard him.
Everybody out.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.498
Yes, sir. Let's move.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.067
Deeks, you, too.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.904
Move.

31:13.906 --> 31:17.441
Okay, I'll be close.

31:20.179 --> 31:23.580
Put your gun down. Now.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.084
Okay.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.120
Okay.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.557
Let's just talk.

31:33.559 --> 31:37.027
Okay? Putting the gun down.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.629
All right?

31:41.567 --> 31:44.067
Let's just talk.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.303
You are a follower
of the prophet?

31:48.407 --> 31:50.908
<i> Alayhi as-salam.</i>

31:50.910 --> 31:52.976
Yes, I am.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.982
Then prepare to meet him
in paradise.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.664
¶ ¶

32:17.403 --> 32:20.070
(sighs)

32:31.016 --> 32:33.016
You inside his phone?

32:33.018 --> 32:34.318
Yeah.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.020
Bomb tech: We're taking
a digital representation

32:37.022 --> 32:39.423
Of nadir's fingerprint
from the phone

32:39.425 --> 32:41.558
And feeding the print
back into the phone.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.493
So the phone will think
he's still holding it.
Exactly.

32:43.495 --> 32:46.296
Done.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.231
He can take his thumb
off the phone.

32:48.233 --> 32:53.203
Okay, here's
the tricky part.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.605
We're gonna need
to hear his pulse.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.976
(muffled heartbeat)

32:59.378 --> 33:00.744
What will help

33:00.746 --> 33:03.647
Is if you can become
as relaxed as possible.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.316
That'll slow your heart,
give us space between beats

33:06.318 --> 33:09.086
To roll in a recording
of your pulse.

33:09.088 --> 33:12.189
I don't know how to do that.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.461
What do you like to do
back in india?

33:17.463 --> 33:20.030
I like to...

33:20.032 --> 33:21.531
I like to draw.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.000
You like to draw?

33:23.002 --> 33:24.501
That's perfect.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.303
Okay, here's what
I want you to do.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.771
Close your eyes...

33:27.773 --> 33:29.573
And draw something.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.408
What?

33:31.410 --> 33:34.044
Well, what do you
normally draw?

33:34.046 --> 33:35.078
Animals.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.313
Great.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.548
Close your eyes

33:38.550 --> 33:40.550
And draw me a...

33:40.552 --> 33:42.252
Crocodile.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.054
I love crocodiles.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.423
I like 'em, too.
They're the best, right?

33:46.425 --> 33:48.091
And, you know, they're
the closest thing we have

33:48.093 --> 33:49.092
To a dinosaur.

33:49.094 --> 33:52.229
What's a dinosaur?

33:56.635 --> 33:59.736
I'm gonna tell you all about it
when we get out of here, okay?

33:59.738 --> 34:01.738
Just close your eyes.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.640
(sighs)

34:03.642 --> 34:05.208
There you go.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.780
His heartbeat's slowing down.
Good job.

34:09.782 --> 34:11.615
(computer beeps)
I'm recording.

34:11.617 --> 34:12.749
(beep)

34:12.751 --> 34:13.717
Got it.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.219
I'll loop it

34:16.221 --> 34:18.688
And sync it to
his live pulse.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.724
Uh, he's speeding up
a little.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.492
Try to keep his beats
per minute the same.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.495
Have you ever seen a crocodile
in real life?

34:25.497 --> 34:28.265
Uh, no, I-I wanted to.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.400
My brother...

34:30.402 --> 34:32.135
And me...

34:32.137 --> 34:34.337
Would look at them in a book.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.406
His pulse is
going up a lot.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.408
I-I want my brother back.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.777
I know how you feel, nadir.
I do.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.112
(beep)
I can't sync it now.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.181
I-I'm scared without him.

34:44.183 --> 34:47.684
When I was your age, I spent
a lot of time being scared.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.820
What did you do?

34:49.822 --> 34:52.789
Well...

34:54.660 --> 34:58.462
There will be people
who come into your life.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.764
And you'll know you're safe

35:00.766 --> 35:02.365
When you're with them.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.104
It's slowing down.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.339
All right,

35:09.341 --> 35:10.807
Let's do this.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.876
(beep)
I'm ready to switch over.

35:15.147 --> 35:16.480
It's gonna be okay.

35:19.251 --> 35:21.451
(beep)
done.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.120
It should be okay
to remove the sensor.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.562
It's over.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.231
(sighs)

35:37.469 --> 35:39.536
Let's get you both
out of here.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.407
Let's get you up the ladder.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.476
Let's get you out.

35:54.153 --> 35:56.419
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I see movement in that window.

35:56.421 --> 35:57.687
Get those people out of there.

35:57.689 --> 35:58.755
Sanjay:
<i> Life</i>

35:58.757 --> 36:00.824
Is nothing compared to heaven.

36:04.897 --> 36:07.164
(indistinct conversation)

36:09.735 --> 36:10.901
We have no choice now.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.302
Of course you do.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.838
You always have a choice.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.939
It is not a choice

36:15.941 --> 36:17.607
To serve god.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.776
You know mohammad,

36:19.778 --> 36:21.811
<i> Alayhi as-salam,</i>

36:21.813 --> 36:25.715
Never sent children into war.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.584
We can only serve
through our jihad.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.686
By taking your own life?
Do you want to die?

36:29.688 --> 36:31.555
Do you want to die?

36:31.557 --> 36:33.723
Do you really want to die?

36:33.725 --> 36:35.559
You know the prophet,
<i> alayhi as-salam.</i>

36:35.561 --> 36:38.328
Said a person
who commits suicide

36:38.330 --> 36:40.597
Is doomed
to all eternity

36:40.599 --> 36:42.599
To repeat his death

36:42.601 --> 36:44.868
Over and over.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.570
Don't listen to him!

36:46.572 --> 36:48.805
Americans lie.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.807
Eric: Sam, using images
from your body cam

36:50.809 --> 36:52.842
And their entrance visas,
we've matched three...

36:52.844 --> 36:53.977
Make that four.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.445
Sorry,
four children,

36:55.447 --> 36:57.581
Using their birthdays,
to the same clinic

36:57.583 --> 36:58.815
Where nadir was born.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.584
Means they have parents.

37:00.586 --> 37:01.918
Use it.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.954
You have a family out there.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.255
No, we don't.
<i> That's</i> a lie!

37:05.257 --> 37:06.256
Listen,

37:06.258 --> 37:07.757
It's difficult to explain...

37:07.759 --> 37:10.493
We will go to heaven now.
<i> Allahu akbar!</i>

37:10.495 --> 37:11.494
No, no, no, no!

37:11.496 --> 37:13.930
Don't do it.
No, no!

37:13.932 --> 37:15.632
Release your vengeance!
I'm telling you

37:15.634 --> 37:17.334
There are people out there
that love you.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.469
He's lying!
Wait, wait, wait!

37:19.471 --> 37:22.606
Just wa...
Just wait. Stop.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.941
Just do this for me.
Imagine allah

37:24.943 --> 37:26.443
In your heart.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.545
What does he feel like?
Is he loving?

37:28.547 --> 37:29.846
Does he care for you?

37:29.848 --> 37:32.582
Does he want us
to take care of one another?

37:32.584 --> 37:34.851
Or does he want us
to destroy one another?

37:35.954 --> 37:38.788
Feel with the heart
that allah gave you.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.528
I don't want to do this.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.531
Please.

37:48.533 --> 37:52.469
We're gonna get that thing
off of you, okay?

37:52.471 --> 37:55.639
Deeks, send up
the bomb squad.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.873
T-take it off me, too.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.475
Deeks:
Kensi, send 'em up now.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.644
I-I don't
want to die.

38:00.646 --> 38:01.778
Take this vest off me.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.946
We will.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.548
Bomb squad is two seconds away.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.550
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

38:07.552 --> 38:09.619
You said we had families?
Is that true?

38:09.621 --> 38:10.954
Yes.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.291
Don't let me die.

38:17.296 --> 38:20.330
I won't. I promise.

38:21.566 --> 38:23.633
Let's get this thing off him.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.940
(sighs)

38:30.942 --> 38:32.876
That was a crazy day.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.595
Yeah, I know.

38:34.596 --> 38:36.313
I mean, not crazier
than we've had before, but...

38:36.315 --> 38:37.647
Yeah, but still,
it's like...

38:37.649 --> 38:39.716
Too crazy for two people
to have a baby.

38:42.354 --> 38:45.789
I mean, I...

38:45.791 --> 38:47.857
I don't know.

38:56.068 --> 38:58.535
Was it too crazy for two
people to get married?

39:01.873 --> 39:03.940
What did you say?

39:05.344 --> 39:07.844
Just wanted to know
if you think it's too crazy

39:07.846 --> 39:09.846
For two people to...

39:09.848 --> 39:11.915
Two people to get married.

39:16.822 --> 39:20.357
No, I... I-I don't think
it's too crazy for that, no.

39:20.359 --> 39:24.060
Sorry, is that-is that...
Is that... Are you saying yes?

39:25.564 --> 39:27.430
Not gonna saying yes
in the hallway at work

39:27.432 --> 39:29.366
Without a ring on my finger.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.468
Oh, so you want me
down on one knee?

39:31.470 --> 39:33.370
Be a good start.

39:33.372 --> 39:36.106
You want the beach
and the sunset with the ring.

39:36.108 --> 39:39.576
Yeah.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.010
Maybe then you'd have a chance.

39:41.012 --> 39:42.746
Okay.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.152
Hey. That's still a yes.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.121
(door opens)
huh? Baby?

39:51.123 --> 39:53.523
Uh-huh, that's a yes.

39:53.525 --> 39:56.426
¶ ¶

40:01.700 --> 40:04.501
Your new clothes
a little stiff?

40:04.503 --> 40:07.404
Well, you wash 'em a couple
times, they'll feel better.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.178
You okay?

40:18.150 --> 40:20.116
What if when I finally
meet them,

40:20.118 --> 40:22.018
They don't want me?

40:24.189 --> 40:26.723
They're your parents.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.858
They're going to want you.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.927
I promise you.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.129
(knocking)

40:33.131 --> 40:34.531
(door opens)

40:34.533 --> 40:37.133
Hello?
Is this the place?

40:37.135 --> 40:39.202
Yeah, come on in.

40:40.172 --> 40:41.171
David:
Hi.

40:41.173 --> 40:42.739
I'm agent callen.

40:42.741 --> 40:43.973
David zahavi.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.208
How are you?

40:45.210 --> 40:47.177
Hello.

40:47.179 --> 40:49.078
Nadir,

40:49.080 --> 40:51.614
This is your mom and dad.

40:51.616 --> 40:54.751
And this is
your brother.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.237
Can we give you a hug?

41:28.954 --> 41:31.754
I'll leave you all alone
for a bit.

41:33.558 --> 41:35.191
Callen.

41:38.763 --> 41:41.498
Remember how you said there
would be people

41:41.500 --> 41:42.732
That would come into my life

41:42.734 --> 41:44.834
And I know
I'd be safe with them?

41:46.805 --> 41:47.871
Yeah.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.839
You were right.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.644
Your mom and dad
are gonna keep you very safe.

41:54.646 --> 41:55.812
I meant you.

42:01.052 --> 42:03.586
Did you ever find out
your first name?

42:03.588 --> 42:05.688
Yeah.

42:07.792 --> 42:08.992
It's grisha.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.727
But, uh...

42:10.729 --> 42:13.229
Nobody calls me that.

42:13.231 --> 42:16.599
Then I will.

42:16.601 --> 42:18.902
Thank you, grisha.
