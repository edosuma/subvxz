Hi, I'm Kimberly Schmidt.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.347
I'm supposed to take my GED
tomorrow, but I never got

00:13.430 --> 00:14.598
my confirmation letter.

00:14.682 --> 00:18.059
Took a couple extra years, but I'm
finally gonna graduate high school.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.688
The test details for your class
were mailed out weeks ago.

00:20.771 --> 00:24.023
I only have one left for
a student with no home address:

00:24.107 --> 00:25.233
Richard Pennsylvania?

00:25.317 --> 00:27.402
That's Dong Nguyen.

00:27.486 --> 00:30.155
We were basically the Roz
and Frasier of our class,

00:30.238 --> 00:33.701
but not sexy like that,
just, you know, cool.

00:33.784 --> 00:34.618
I get it.

00:34.702 --> 00:38.205
I kind of have a Kyle
and Maxine thing with my boss.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.457
Oh, you don't know
<i>Living Single,</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:42.501
but I'm supposed to know
everything about <i>Frasier?</i>

00:43.711 --> 00:46.296
Y'all stole the name Frasier
from us anyway.

All right, Kimmy, today is a big day,
so we need to move quickly.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.665
Like chop-chop,
that place where they cut your hair

01:21.749 --> 01:23.042
during plastic surgery.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.753
My First Americans

01:25.836 --> 01:29.048
is having its premier gala in three weeks,

01:29.130 --> 01:34.386

something from his designer line

01:46.398 --> 01:48.943
"Crotte de Nez," but Buckley
has a doctor's appointment

01:49.026 --> 01:51.653
and school is closed
for Rupert Murdoch's birthday,

01:51.737 --> 01:53.655
so you'll have to stay on top of him.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.532
He behaves more when you sit on his chest.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.617
Buckley!

01:56.700 --> 01:57.700
No!

01:57.743 --> 01:59.661
Kimmy, stop him!

02:02.748 --> 02:04.249
Oh. Where is she?

02:04.332 --> 02:06.334

02:46.500 --> 02:47.793
Nothing's up with me.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.211
These are famous show tunes
that everyone loves.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.006
You seriously don't know these songs?

02:52.089 --> 02:54.173
My family was poor.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.093
The closest thing we had to a radio

02:56.175 --> 02:58.971
was a mentally ill uncle
who talked about the weather

02:59.054 --> 03:00.179
every nine minutes.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.017
Good news, your crash course
in the Great American Songbook

03:03.100 --> 03:05.686
starts immediately
and lasts forever!

03:07.688 --> 03:09.106
Titus, do I have any mail?

03:09.188 --> 03:10.774
Girl, you know I don't know.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.318
Check my Quest Diagnostic Barbie chalet.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.862
I missed a GED letter.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.404
It looks like this.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.993
Kimmy, why do you have this?

03:21.076 --> 03:23.554
They didn't have an address for Dong,
so I'm gonna drop it off.

03:23.578 --> 03:27.833
You sure you're not just using this
as an excuse to see him?

03:27.916 --> 03:30.335
Like when Bobby Durst came back

03:30.418 --> 03:34.422
to get his conveniently forgotten
bow saws?

03:34.506 --> 03:36.050
Sly devil.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.342
Maybe real devil.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.928
Lillian, if I just wanted to see Dong,
I'd have gone back

03:40.012 --> 03:41.180
for my scrunchie already.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.182
I mean, that's 78¢ down the drain.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.266
Hmm.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.350
What?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.563
Without blue, my whole weekly
rotation is off.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.899
I can't wear a green scrunchie
on Thursday.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.316
Everyone will think I'm horny.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.735
That's true. I will.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.779
Why are you helping Dong at all?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.364
He dumped you.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.866
I'm not gonna let him fail his GED

04:00.949 --> 04:02.159
because he broke up with me.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.454
Kiddo, all I'm saying is seeing him again
might be tougher than you think.

04:06.538 --> 04:07.372
Really?

04:07.455 --> 04:09.499
Tougher than keeping hope alive
in a bunker

04:09.583 --> 04:11.352
where the end of your braid
is your toothbrush

04:11.376 --> 04:12.460
and your best friend?

04:12.544 --> 04:13.545
Touché.

04:13.628 --> 04:14.462
I'll be fine.

04:14.546 --> 04:15.690
I'll just stick it in his mail slot.

04:15.714 --> 04:16.548
He won't even see me.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.132
Kimmy.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.803
That reminds me of this gem

04:21.887 --> 04:25.473

I'm sorry, I don't know what's
gotten into Buckley today.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.656
He's usually much more of
a someone else's problem than this.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.617
Your son's in good physical health,
Ms. White.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.202
Whoo!

05:27.286 --> 05:28.287
That's odd.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.705
We don't have an anatomy
skeleton in this office.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.457
But in terms of behavioral development,

05:32.540 --> 05:35.169
Buckley could benefit from
a little discipline.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.086
Oh.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.213
Don't worry, I'm not suggesting
actual parenting.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.131
Oh.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.175
I know how busy we all are.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.303
I'm talking about medication.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.138
"Dyziplen"?

05:46.221 --> 05:49.016
"Treats hyperactivity, ADHD,

05:49.099 --> 05:52.269
and Kanye West Spectrum Disorder."

05:52.351 --> 05:54.896
No, my son doesn't need
to be medicated.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.565
He just bites sometimes
to loosen his baby teeth.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.985
No, I'm not saying Buckley
has any diagnosable

06:00.068 --> 06:02.779
behavioral disorder,
just he's a handful.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.074
Which is a medical term
for how many pills he needs.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.326
Think it over.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.537
You're my bitch, Geoffrey.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.916
Okay, Kimmy, just pretend
it's any old door.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.835
Hey, door.
What's up?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.253
Cool, cool.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.297
You ever miss being a tree?

06:20.379 --> 06:21.965
Yeah, I get that.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.552
Anyway, just gonna shove
a letter-ino up your mouth flap.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.469
Sonja!

06:26.553 --> 06:27.554
Hi, Kimmy!

06:27.637 --> 06:29.223
We never see you anymore!

06:29.306 --> 06:30.349
Come in.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.933
Oh, no. I can't stay.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.476
You two catch up.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.979
I'll make popsicles for everyone.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.731
Oh, no, you don't...

06:38.190 --> 06:40.150
Kimmy, I thought I made myself clear.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.027
Clearly Canadian.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.570
Crystal Pepsi.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.655
I was just dropping off your GED letter.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.325
My test is in a couple weeks.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.370
Cool, well, I guess we're done here.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.121
Oh, do you have my blue scrunchie?

06:53.205 --> 06:54.289
I left it at your party.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.833
It smells like Salon Selectives
and silverfish poison?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.877
I don't know what you're talking about.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.338
It's fine if you threw it out,
you just owe me 78¢.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.820
And I'll pay you when I have
that kind of money lying around.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.303
Dong, are you okay?

07:08.387 --> 07:11.806
Sonja and I have an interview
tomorrow at Immigration.

07:11.890 --> 07:15.352
If we can't prove we're a real couple,
I'll get deported.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.562
I don't want to go back to Vietnam, Kimmy.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.314
It's full of baby boomer tourists

07:19.398 --> 07:21.066
trying to feel something.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.735
Look, you always knew how
to prepare for a test.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.819
What do you have so far?

07:26.071 --> 07:27.197
Our wedding album.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.949
This is the only picture.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.284
Is this from a security camera?

07:30.367 --> 07:32.869
No, it's from our witnesses:

07:32.953 --> 07:35.830
two Harlem Globetrotters who were
getting gay married right after us.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.791
So make a fake photo album.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.794
In my experience, if someone has
good pictures and a glue stick,

07:40.877 --> 07:43.297
they can make it look like
they dunked on Jesus,

07:43.380 --> 07:47.759
and some girls will believe it,
for, like, 15 years.

07:51.430 --> 07:54.033
I'm sure you and Sonja have someone
who could help you take pictures.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.435
I can ask Neptune to help.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.272
Because he's a non-sexual friend.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.190
You're being paranoid, Dong.

08:03.233 --> 08:07.862
Anyway, the popsicles
will just be another 40 minutes.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.407
This is hopeless.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.574
Maybe...

08:11.658 --> 08:12.742
just let me help you.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.286
I don't know, Kimmy.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.203
Are you sure you can handle that?

08:15.287 --> 08:16.121
I mean...

08:16.204 --> 08:17.789
Don't worry about me.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.249
I'm like a biscotti.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.335
People act like I'm this sweet cookie,

08:21.418 --> 08:23.253
but I'm really this super hard thing

08:23.337 --> 08:26.881
that nobody knows what I am or why I am.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.175
So let's do this!

08:28.258 --> 08:30.302
Let's take a bunch of pictures
of you and Sonja

08:30.385 --> 08:32.846
going to first base
super hard on each other!

08:39.059 --> 08:42.605
Okay, so you can be Megatron,
and I'll be Optimus Prime.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.524
Okay.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.403
Hey, other robot guys,
let's go save the sun or whatever.

08:48.487 --> 08:49.321
No!

08:49.404 --> 08:50.489
You're a bad guy.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.532
Oh, God.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.075
Okay, ow.
All right.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.576
Okay, I extinguished your Allspark.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.537
- Now you're dead.
- Oh, no.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.999
Now I'll have to lie down
and be left alone.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.384
Kimmy, where are you?

09:10.467 --> 09:12.344
- I need some help here.
- Hey, no.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.513
You have to stay still until
Sky Lynx saves you.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.307
- You lost your Allspark.
- Okay, okay, okay.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.672
<i>Ms. White, I'm sorry.
I can't come over right now.</i>

09:19.726 --> 09:22.479
I have the GED
and a crafting emergency...

09:22.562 --> 09:24.814
Are you listing things at me?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.649
I need you here now.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.819
<i>There's no school
and I don't have a television.</i>

09:29.903 --> 09:33.031
Lagerfeld is sending over
a squad of his nastiest boys

09:33.114 --> 09:34.533
for my dress fitting.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.076
They hate children.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.661
If my crotchfruit is here,
they'll know I'm a moo!

09:38.745 --> 09:40.539
No, you can't move.

09:40.621 --> 09:41.622
Ms. White, I'm sorry.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.999
Don't be sorry,

09:43.083 --> 09:44.292
<i>just get here.</i>

09:44.376 --> 09:45.936
You'll pay for this, Starscream.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.796
Kimmy, I've never spent an entire day

09:48.880 --> 09:50.424
alone with Buckley.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.509
I've always had help from someone:

09:52.592 --> 09:54.719
a nanny or a driver

09:54.802 --> 09:56.846
or an iPad taped to a bag of sugar.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.473
I don't know how to do this.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.849
What if it poops?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.118
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

10:01.142 --> 10:02.537
Maybe you could take him to the park.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.938
He loves the big slide at 66th Street

10:05.021 --> 10:06.416
'cause sometimes nannies fall down it.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.483
<i>You might have fun.</i>

10:08.567 --> 10:10.944
Okay, so now I'll be Mark Wahlberg.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.946
No!

10:17.158 --> 10:18.701
Autobots, roll out!

10:18.785 --> 10:20.287
Take that, Megatron!

10:25.083 --> 10:27.961
<i>♪ Stoop Crone, no loitering please ♪</i>

10:28.044 --> 10:30.880
<i>♪ Stoop Crone, you're kind of a skeeze ♪</i>

10:30.964 --> 10:32.757
That better be from a musical.

10:32.840 --> 10:33.967
Of course!

10:34.050 --> 10:36.177
It's from Rodgers and Hammerstein's

10:36.261 --> 10:39.306
<i>Croon, Crone, Croon!</i>
which was eventually reworked

10:39.389 --> 10:41.141
into <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

10:41.224 --> 10:43.393
Oh, thank you, Nazis,
for saving show business.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.644
I said it!

10:44.727 --> 10:48.106
Yeah, well, Kimmy never came back.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.067
Probably still with Dong
making goo-goo eyes

10:51.151 --> 10:53.487
'cause our building
gives everyone pinkeye.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.405
So you think she still loves him?

10:55.489 --> 10:57.991
Like in one of the great love songs
of all time,

10:58.074 --> 10:59.284
"You're My Baby Now"?

11:01.702 --> 11:03.746
<i>♪ Baby, I get lost ♪</i>

11:03.830 --> 11:05.957

11:10.044 --> 11:12.130

11:12.213 --> 11:13.840
Don't be disgusting, Lillian.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.468
It's from <i>Daddy's Boy,</i>
an innocent musical

11:16.551 --> 11:19.804
about a father's love for his infant son.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.098
The composer was beaten
to death in jail,

11:22.182 --> 11:25.268
which reminds me of
another song you'll definitely know.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.769
<i>♪ Whomp goes the billy club ♪</i>

11:26.853 --> 11:28.355

11:28.438 --> 11:30.857

11:30.940 --> 11:34.068
You can't say two words without singing.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.197
Wait a minute.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.033
You don't want to teach me songs.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.953
You can't stop singing
'cause you're happy.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.457
Happy? No.

11:47.541 --> 11:48.958
I'm just singing because...

11:50.918 --> 11:52.337
Lillian, no.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.713
Lillian.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.632
Happy?

11:55.714 --> 11:57.884
Well, why wouldn't you be?

11:57.967 --> 12:01.012
You're dating a nice boy,
your one-man show went good,

12:01.095 --> 12:03.722
and you got a free piano.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.059
This is the best your life has ever gone.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.477
No!

12:07.561 --> 12:10.313
You're wrong, Stoop Crone!

13:44.365 --> 13:45.784
said you'd be much calmer by now.

13:45.866 --> 13:49.329
I am gonna make that into a waterslide!

Oh.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.098
Of course.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.901
Is he on Dyziplen?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.445
Praise Jesus.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.905
Thank God the FDA fast-tracked that drug.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.785
Whee.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.037
Tag, you are it.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.539
I am.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.207
Thank you.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.336
Is every child here on Dyziplen?

14:38.419 --> 14:39.713
Oh, yes.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.631
That drug saved me so much time,

14:41.715 --> 14:44.884
I was finally able to finish
my tell-all book about my boss.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.136
It's called <i>Sippy Cup Rosé</i>
and it's gonna have a shoe

14:47.220 --> 14:48.388
on the cover.

14:48.471 --> 14:51.015
I can't believe how calm they all are.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.267
Mommy, I am tired.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.646
Can we go sit someplace quiet

I know you haven't been studying
because I found your GED books

15:10.660 --> 15:13.454
coated with a day's worth of asbestos.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.997
What are you doing?

15:15.081 --> 15:18.959
Also, try not to breathe in here
too much from now on and before.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.545
Lillian, I'm fine.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.231
I've been studying for weeks,
and I just have to take

15:22.255 --> 15:24.965
one more photo of Dong and Sonja
so he doesn't get deported.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.634
We're recreating their fake engagement

15:26.718 --> 15:28.928
at Sonja's annual Grammy Awards party.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.180
A Grammy party?

15:31.264 --> 15:33.099
Is this woman insane?

15:33.182 --> 15:36.770
Well, I think she's cheating
on Dong with a statue, so you tell me.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.146
If all this is about helping Dong,

15:39.230 --> 15:42.191
then how come your bookmark is this?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.193
It's all right here in your MASH.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.780
Apparently you're gonna live in a shack,

15:46.863 --> 15:48.740
drive a Porsche,

15:48.823 --> 15:51.117
honeymoon at FAO Schwarz,

15:51.200 --> 15:53.578
all with your husband Dong.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.580
Fine, you win.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.415
I have hope.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.959
Hope that got me through
15 years in the bunker.

16:00.042 --> 16:00.919
I don't quit.

16:01.001 --> 16:04.881
Sweetie, you can't keep running
into a brick wall.

16:05.924 --> 16:06.966
Shows what you know.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.597
How does the Kool-Aid Man do this?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.808
Kimmy, I was you once.

16:14.891 --> 16:19.562
I waited like a fool
for something that could never be.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.606
And his name...

16:21.689 --> 16:23.733
was the Second Avenue Subway.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.025
It was a he?

16:25.109 --> 16:27.570
Oh, you're goddamn right it was.

16:27.654 --> 16:32.951
The city had been promising
to build it since 1916,

16:33.033 --> 16:38.372
so I figured by the '70s,
it was due any minute,

16:38.456 --> 16:43.336
so I waited for years
in a tiny Murray Hill apartment,

16:43.419 --> 16:45.212
not a pot to piss in.

16:45.296 --> 16:48.007
It was a plastic cup with
Reggie Jackson on it.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.801
Donna Maria and I bathroomed

16:49.884 --> 16:51.678
into a trick-or-treating pumpkin.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.472
I waited and I suffered,

16:54.555 --> 16:59.352
but the subway didn't come,
so I gave up on the train,

16:59.435 --> 17:02.730
I left Murray Hill, and I moved here

17:02.814 --> 17:05.441
where I met the love of my life.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.026
So you quit?

17:07.108 --> 17:10.363
I know you're tough and you never give up.

17:10.445 --> 17:14.867
Sometimes the hardest thing
to do is just quit

17:14.951 --> 17:16.452
and walk away.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.372
Sorry, but giving up isn't my jam.

17:19.454 --> 17:23.584
My jams are grape, jock, and space,

17:23.667 --> 17:24.854
and I've got 12 hours till my test.

You were so happy before.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.179
I was until you said I was!

18:17.263 --> 18:20.433
Well, how did my calling you happy
make you sad?

18:30.443 --> 18:31.694
Because!

18:33.404 --> 18:36.574
When I was singing before,
it didn't even occur to me

18:36.657 --> 18:37.825
that I was happy.

18:37.909 --> 18:40.536
I thought it was just gas
coming out in a weird way,

18:40.620 --> 18:43.163
but then you pointed out
that this is the best my life

18:43.247 --> 18:46.542
has ever gone, and now I'm panicked
I'm gonna lose it all!

18:46.626 --> 18:48.753
Happiness is fleeting, Lillian,

18:48.836 --> 18:49.879
and you fleeted it!

18:49.963 --> 18:51.422
Oh, my...

18:55.760 --> 18:57.762
Ms. White, I'm sorry,
but I still can't make it.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.765
Actually, Kimmy,
I don't need help with Buckley.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.683
<i>We had an amazing day.</i>

19:02.767 --> 19:05.686
Shopped for shoes, lunched at The Carlyle,

19:05.770 --> 19:08.648
even had our caricatures done
in Central Park.

19:08.731 --> 19:09.774
Are you sure it's Buckley?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.233
Does he have an English accent?

19:11.317 --> 19:12.777
'Cause it could be a parent trap.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.236
<i>No, it was me.</i>

19:14.320 --> 19:15.571
I did it.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.573
I'm like a female Mr. Mom.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.117
<i>It's hard to admit this, Kimmy,</i>

19:19.199 --> 19:22.620
but the only reason I had
Buckley was to hook Julian.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.706
I've never really known
how to connect with him,

19:25.790 --> 19:29.002
but today was more rewarding
than I could have ever imagined.

19:29.085 --> 19:29.919
<i>Good for you!</i>

19:30.003 --> 19:32.005
See what happens
when you don't give up hope?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.714
Anything is possible!

19:33.798 --> 19:35.299
We should start a band!

19:35.382 --> 19:38.070
Look, the only thing I need you
to do is pick up Buckley's medication.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.261
<i>I'm almost out,</i>

19:39.345 --> 19:40.864
and I need him to behave at the fitting.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.474
Wait, you gave him drugs
to make him behave?

19:43.557 --> 19:47.061
I know you were frozen in ice
for ten years or whatever,

19:47.145 --> 19:49.147
but tons of people take this stuff now.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.690
So have you tried it?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.528
Of course I have.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.447
What kind of mother do you think I am?

20:00.074 --> 20:02.910
Why, I'm on it now, and I feel great!

20:02.994 --> 20:06.747
So great, in fact,
I'll go to the drugstore myself,

20:06.831 --> 20:10.084
despite the fact the last time
I was in a drugstore was in 2004,

20:10.168 --> 20:12.879
<i>and an employee named LaDonica
said to me,</i>

20:12.962 --> 20:15.756
"Bitch, I don't know your life."

20:17.383 --> 20:18.258
Kimmy!

20:18.342 --> 20:19.342
I can't find Sonja!

20:19.385 --> 20:20.302
What?

20:20.386 --> 20:21.488
I don't know where she went.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.847
She didn't even take her phone.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.141
So your wife disappeared.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.601
It's just you and no wife right now?

20:27.685 --> 20:29.645
Our interview's first thing
in the morning.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.730
We can find her, right?

20:30.813 --> 20:31.898
Never give up.

20:31.981 --> 20:32.815
Yes.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.459
We are both thinking about not giving up

20:34.483 --> 20:36.069
in the exact same way right now.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.195
She could be anywhere,

20:37.277 --> 20:38.797
but let's first start with
the last two places

20:38.821 --> 20:39.864
she was asked to leave:

20:39.947 --> 20:42.533
I'll check the zoo,
you check Maggie Gyllenhaal's porch.

20:51.209 --> 20:54.294
This is what I want my funeral
to look like:

20:54.378 --> 20:57.048
surrounded by friends.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.841
The only limits are your imagination.

20:58.925 --> 20:59.967
Let's go crazy!

21:00.051 --> 21:01.385
Yeah.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.057
What do you think?

21:06.140 --> 21:07.683
I don't know.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.309
They're just clothes.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.647
She isn't worth it, Quentstopher!

21:13.731 --> 21:15.191
I already have clothes.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.859
Why would I need more clothes?

21:18.069 --> 21:19.445
What's happening?

21:19.528 --> 21:20.404
My brain.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.323
It's Talbots-ing.

21:32.875 --> 21:36.545
Dyziplen ate my joy.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.842
I just checked the morgue.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.761
They said Sonja
hasn't been there in weeks.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.596
Our interview is first thing
in the morning.

21:45.679 --> 21:49.142
Guess it's back to Vietnam
to work at the family business...

21:49.225 --> 21:52.686
a sweatshop that manufactures
iPhone notification sounds.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.063
Ba-ding.

21:54.147 --> 21:54.981
Boo-ga-dee.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.440
Or...

21:56.523 --> 21:57.984
I could be Sonja.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.485
I could go with you to Immigration.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.361
Who knows you better than I do?

22:01.445 --> 22:03.864
We finish each other's senten...

22:05.783 --> 22:06.617
...ces.

22:06.700 --> 22:10.204
And wow, this is weird,
but I already have an album

22:10.288 --> 22:11.205
full of pictures of us.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.749
I think Immigration could
believe we're in love.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.169
Here we are in a Central Park
paddleboat, where your legs

22:16.252 --> 22:17.170
are totally just as strong as mine...

22:17.253 --> 22:18.253
Stop it!

22:18.296 --> 22:20.047
Why do you keep doing this?
I'm married.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.591
- But don't you still hope...
- No.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.802
Kimmy, Sonja was there
when I needed her,

22:24.885 --> 22:26.887
and now we have an arrangement
that works.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.556
I get to stay in the country,
and she gets a husband

22:29.640 --> 22:31.892
who can be a male role model
for her birds.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.144
You're gonna ruin everything!

22:33.227 --> 22:34.061
Let it go!

22:34.145 --> 22:35.145
You're being crazy!

22:35.188 --> 22:36.605
Me?

22:36.689 --> 22:39.525
Your wife thinks
she's hooking up with Neptune!

22:40.776 --> 22:42.486
Kimmy, you're right!

22:42.569 --> 22:44.155
I am?

22:44.238 --> 22:45.614
About which part?

22:51.037 --> 22:52.746
I'm sorry, Neptune.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.540
It's over.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.167
Here are your CDs back.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.714
I was worried about you.

23:01.797 --> 23:05.259
Always take your phone and charger.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.804
Okay, cool.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.056
Congratulations.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.599
Dong, I guess I'll just see you
when you have that 78¢

23:12.683 --> 23:14.101
for my scrunchie.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.353
You can bring it by whenever.

23:15.435 --> 23:16.729
Hang on.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.622
Well, I guess I'll go take my GED,

23:35.706 --> 23:37.124
which is in a few hours.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.834
I'll let you know how it goes,

23:38.918 --> 23:41.587
maybe give you some answers.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.382
Abraham Lincoln, potassium,

23:44.464 --> 23:45.674
four...

23:47.051 --> 23:48.302
that kind of stuff.

23:48.386 --> 23:49.636
Bye.

23:55.268 --> 23:57.811
Oh, my God.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.106
What happened?

24:00.189 --> 24:02.816
My fitting.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.403
What gown did I...

24:05.485 --> 24:07.154
Holy Jesus!

24:07.238 --> 24:09.240
A peplum?

24:09.323 --> 24:10.783
Oh, no.

24:11.658 --> 24:15.121
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.914
Crepe palazzos?

24:16.997 --> 24:20.334
You're not a gown at all, you monster!

24:20.418 --> 24:21.877
Good morning, Mommy.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.713
Good morning, Buckley.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.608
Do you want to draw something
with your markers?

24:26.632 --> 24:28.884
Ruin the wall for Mommy, Buckley.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.510
No, thank you.

24:30.594 --> 24:34.472
I like how it's all white and flat...

24:34.556 --> 24:36.642
like my dreams.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.236
Goodbye, sweet boy.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.132
I'm gonna ace this.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.758
Science section, blammo!

25:09.842 --> 25:12.136
English section,
wherefore art thou, Blammeo?

25:12.219 --> 25:13.262
What's next?

25:14.430 --> 25:16.349
Karate section. Let's do this!

25:17.808 --> 25:19.101
Puppy-naming section, go!

25:19.185 --> 25:20.394
Dexter, Patches, Reggie!

25:20.478 --> 25:21.603
Skip it and come back.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.147
Ginger, Winston, Beemer!

25:23.230 --> 25:24.315
Math section.

25:24.398 --> 25:27.109
If Dong is a subway train
traveling away from Kimmy

25:27.193 --> 25:29.445
at a trillion miles an hour,
how long will you wait

25:29.527 --> 25:31.071
before you fudge up your life?

25:32.948 --> 25:33.782
Oh, no.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.204
And time.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.878
Why didn't you wake me up?

25:45.961 --> 25:49.215
I don't go to where you work
and tell you to wake me up.

25:56.347 --> 25:58.432
Buckley, Mommy needs
to find a gala gown.

25:58.516 --> 25:59.350
Can you be a good...

25:59.433 --> 26:01.435
Yeah!

26:01.519 --> 26:03.979
Do you have any Met Ball-style dresses?

26:04.063 --> 26:06.106
I'm fine with sheer panels
and rump chains.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.317
Die, Decepticon!
Acid spray!

26:08.401 --> 26:09.276
Ow.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.194
I'm so sorry.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.945
- Buckley, sweetie.
- Die, die, die!

26:12.029 --> 26:13.298
Give the mannequin its arm back.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.449
Maybe you should come back
some other time.

26:15.533 --> 26:17.784
Sans crotchfruit.

26:17.868 --> 26:20.996
Hold on, I just need
to extinguish his Allspark.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.873
Oh, with Dyziplen?
I take that.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.267
You're all going in the freezer!

26:24.291 --> 26:28.254
Prime, I'm destroying your spark
with my ion blaster!

26:30.130 --> 26:33.591
Now he can't move until Sky Lynx
regenerates him.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.011
So can you bring me something in my size?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.221
Uh-huh.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.723
Oh, I'm sorry, were you an eight or a ten?

26:39.806 --> 26:41.517
What?

26:41.599 --> 26:45.938
Autobot, this Trypticon
is gonna meet Hellscream!

26:51.151 --> 26:52.152
Yeah!

26:52.236 --> 26:53.904
Die!

26:57.657 --> 26:59.785
Hey, Red.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.581
Well, I failed the GED because
I can't quit Dong.

27:03.663 --> 27:07.209
I just... I don't like giving up on stuff.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.462
I still want Nickelodeon
to take over my school.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.380
Listen.

27:11.464 --> 27:14.508
You had your first real love

27:14.592 --> 27:16.051
and it ended badly.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.929
But Dong's only gonna be married
for two years.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.638
I can do two years standing on my head.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.057
Actually, in the bunker...

27:22.141 --> 27:24.143
Again with the bunker.

27:24.226 --> 27:27.438
You're like one of those ladies
who go to Montreal,

27:27.521 --> 27:32.401
and then, suddenly,
everything is about Montreal.

27:32.485 --> 27:36.405
Kimmy, the sooner you quit
something that stinks,

27:36.489 --> 27:41.243
the sooner you can find
something that doesn't.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.203
Save your hope for that.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.687
So, anything bad happen to you yet?

28:09.771 --> 28:11.565
You sat next to me.

28:11.649 --> 28:14.360
Titus, that crapped-up
Raggedy Ann out there

28:14.443 --> 28:15.902
had a tough day,

28:15.986 --> 28:19.697
but we both know
her luck is gonna change.

28:19.781 --> 28:24.036
Just like we both know
your good times can't last forever.

28:24.119 --> 28:28.207
Maybe you'll marry Mikey,
maybe you'll break up.

28:28.290 --> 28:31.460
Maybe you'll live together for decades,

28:31.544 --> 28:35.339
but then he'll die first
of an awful brain disease.

28:35.422 --> 28:38.967
Damn it, Lillian, what kind of white
<i>Six Feet Under </i> nonsense is this?

28:39.051 --> 28:44.557
Maybe I should put it in terms
that you could understand.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.560
"When I was a little girl,
many moons ago,

28:47.643 --> 28:50.604
my mother gave me a bit of wisdom,

28:50.688 --> 28:54.941
because wisdom was all she had."

28:55.025 --> 28:57.611
Is that from
