Hey, you.

00:52.930 --> 00:55.065
Charlie's lungs are a little crackly.

00:55.099 --> 00:56.182
Since when?

00:56.216 --> 00:57.250
His latest scan would have been...

00:57.285 --> 00:58.768
Thursday, and it was clear.

00:58.819 --> 01:00.904
I'm not hearing things.

01:00.938 --> 01:02.689
Can we order another X-ray, Mel?

01:04.075 --> 01:06.526
I'm telling you, they're crackly.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.863
I'm working emerg tonight.
Page me as soon as you know?

01:09.897 --> 01:12.198
You just finished a shift.
You're starting another one?

01:12.232 --> 01:13.566
Yep.

01:14.902 --> 01:16.870
Pneumonia.

01:16.904 --> 01:19.205
Perfect.

01:19.239 --> 01:21.574

You're making my palms sweat.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.636
Well, you should probably
get that checked out.

01:32.687 --> 01:35.221
Uh, I'm expecting Mr. Travers
to come out of traction anytime,

01:35.255 --> 01:36.640
so as soon as he does...

01:36.691 --> 01:37.924
- I'll page you. Don't worry.
- Right.

01:37.942 --> 01:39.859
The full spinal reconstruction.

01:39.894 --> 01:41.278
It's all about the glory with you.

01:41.312 --> 01:42.896
Have a fun night, rock star.

01:42.930 --> 01:45.282
I'll try and get there later.

01:47.785 --> 01:50.436
I see nothing. I hear nothing.

(sighs) Shahir's birthday party.

01:58.546 --> 02:01.081
- You're not coming along?
- I picked up a night shift.

02:01.115 --> 02:02.782
- I think you're working too hard.
- I have to get somebody

02:02.800 --> 02:04.634
To cover some of Charlie's
coma arousal therapy.

02:04.669 --> 02:08.138
It costs money. So where's the thing?

02:08.172 --> 02:10.757
Some place called "El Convento"...

02:10.791 --> 02:12.058
Rico? Really?

02:12.093 --> 02:13.243
Yeah.

02:13.277 --> 02:14.978
You're going to El Convento Rico?

02:15.012 --> 02:16.596
I am. Do you know it?

02:18.049 --> 02:19.516
You're gonna love it.

02:19.567 --> 02:21.300
You're a little underdressed, though.

02:21.319 --> 02:24.154
(chuckles)

02:25.656 --> 02:27.023
(baby crying in distance)

02:27.074 --> 02:29.526
Oh. Hi. You look like an actual doctor.

02:29.577 --> 02:31.027
Um, we've been waiting for two hours,

02:31.078 --> 02:33.363
and my husband needs an X-ray.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.448
You need to talk to the triage nurse.

02:35.482 --> 02:37.450
Oh. I did, and guess what?

02:37.484 --> 02:40.954
They told me to wait.
I don't suppose you take bribes.

02:40.988 --> 02:42.155
(chuckles) We'll be with
you as soon as we can.

02:42.173 --> 02:43.707
Okay.

02:43.758 --> 02:45.458
Hey.

02:45.492 --> 02:47.544
Hey. How's Charlie doing?

02:47.595 --> 02:50.296
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm here to work.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.299
- Then the E.R. is the place for you.
- Treat 'em and street 'em.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.185
Ha. Well, there's some stuff
in the middle there, too.

02:55.219 --> 02:57.721
Looks like a nice, quiet Saturday night.

02:57.772 --> 03:00.023
Which you have just jinxed.

03:00.057 --> 03:01.841
I'm a capricorn.
I don't believe in jinxes.

03:01.859 --> 03:02.892
Well, I am an E.R. doctor,

03:02.943 --> 03:04.561
and I don't believe in quiet nights.

03:04.612 --> 03:07.513
Dr. Miller? Major trauma. Two minutes out.

03:07.531 --> 03:09.816
Get it up on the board. Capricorn, huh?

03:09.850 --> 03:12.852
(siren wailing)

03:14.121 --> 03:17.023
(radio chatter)

03:17.041 --> 03:19.525
Patient's name's Eddie.
Mid-20s. B.P. 60 on palp.

03:19.543 --> 03:21.161
- Any meds on board?
- No.

03:21.195 --> 03:23.196
We bolused 2 liters of saline.
He's lost a buttload of blood.

03:23.214 --> 03:25.031
Pressure's still dropping.
Must've hit something major.

03:25.049 --> 03:26.365
- What happened?
- Stabbing in a nightclub.

03:26.384 --> 03:28.367
- B.P. 50 systolic.
- He's crashing.

03:28.386 --> 03:30.203
He's not gonna make it up to the O.R.

03:30.221 --> 03:32.205
So we do it here. Are you up for that?

03:32.223 --> 03:33.723
Hell, yeah.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.026
All right. Give him more fluids.

03:36.060 --> 03:38.044
2 units O-neg. Cross and match 4 more.

03:38.062 --> 03:39.045
(monitor beeping rhythmically) Ready?

03:39.063 --> 03:40.563
Let's do it.

03:43.934 --> 03:45.402
(squish)

03:45.436 --> 03:48.054
God, I love watching you work.

03:48.072 --> 03:49.072
Okay. There's a lot of blood.

03:49.106 --> 03:50.690
I am not gonna be seeing the source

03:50.724 --> 03:52.058
unless I get control here. Suction.

03:52.076 --> 03:53.726
All right. Let's get some more fluids.

03:53.744 --> 03:55.028
I'm gonna need some more sponges.

03:55.062 --> 03:56.329
- (man) I've got it.
- There it is.

03:56.363 --> 03:57.947
Inferior vena cava.
(monitor beeping erratically)

03:57.998 --> 03:59.783
- No wonder he's bleeding so much.
- B.P.'s tankin'.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.526
We're losing him.
(monitor emits continuous tone)

04:01.540 --> 04:02.570
- No pulse.
- Damn it.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.671
- You got enough pressure on there?
- Yes. Uh, keep pouring fluids.

04:04.705 --> 04:05.672
All right. Start compressions.

04:05.706 --> 04:06.410
Push 1 of epi.

04:06.449 --> 04:07.406
Vascular loupes.

04:08.592 --> 04:10.709
And right on cue.

04:12.096 --> 04:13.913
(grunts) Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:13.931 --> 04:16.216
- Little guy, slow down!
- (panting) Where the hell am I?

04:16.250 --> 04:18.517
You're in a hospital in surgery.

04:18.552 --> 04:19.327
You were knifed.

04:19.370 --> 04:20.937
Nothing. Still flat.

04:20.971 --> 04:22.772
(Zach) Keep going. Keep going.

04:22.807 --> 04:25.892
No way. Seriously? That's me?

04:25.926 --> 04:28.261
Yeah, and you're about to die. I'm sorry.

04:28.279 --> 04:31.281
- You probably don't want to watch this part.
- No. No, no, no.

04:31.315 --> 04:32.543
This isn't gonna happen,
okay? They gotta do something.

04:32.582 --> 04:33.419
(Alex) There's too much blood.

04:33.438 --> 04:36.552
Come on! Do something!
They can't hear you, Eddie.

04:36.780 --> 04:39.489
Okay? It's over. You have to let go.

04:39.540 --> 04:42.075
Come on. Let's go. Let's go!

04:42.109 --> 04:44.677
I'll mess you up. Come on.
Fight! Let's go! <i>Fight!</i>

04:44.754 --> 04:45.339
(monitor beeping rhythmically) Got it.

04:45.387 --> 04:48.013
- I've got a pulse.
- (sighs) Okay. We're back.

04:48.052 --> 04:48.922
How'd you do that?

04:48.971 --> 04:50.426
I'm gonna start looking
for other injuries.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.801
More suction, please.

04:51.836 --> 04:55.171
(suction gurgles)

04:58.034 --> 05:00.118
Well, he's breathing, barely.

05:00.136 --> 05:01.886
Good. I just sent the cops up to I.C.U.

05:01.921 --> 05:04.306
Well, they're gonna have to wait.
He's in a coma.

05:04.340 --> 05:05.957
That was fun, though.

05:07.009 --> 05:08.960
So what's next?

05:08.978 --> 05:11.413
Reid the machine. I love it.

05:11.447 --> 05:12.747
You're a hockey fan, right?

05:12.782 --> 05:14.082
Rabid.

05:14.116 --> 05:15.317
(lowered voice) 1:00.

05:15.351 --> 05:16.985
- Just like that one.
- (chuckles) Yeah.

05:17.019 --> 05:18.820
(lowered voice) Hey, is that Todd Fahey?

05:18.854 --> 05:22.307
(singsongy)
In the flesh, and he's all yours.

05:22.325 --> 05:24.192
(chuckles)

05:24.243 --> 05:25.744
- Or even that...
- Mr. Fahey.

05:25.778 --> 05:27.312
- Hi.
- I'm Dr. Reid.

05:27.330 --> 05:28.863
I have to say, you look a lot smaller

05:28.914 --> 05:30.148
without the shoulder pads and the skates.

05:30.166 --> 05:31.833
I could still take you, doc.

05:31.867 --> 05:34.369
I don't know. Three older brothers.
St. Catharines.

05:34.420 --> 05:36.671
No way! I'm Grimsby.

05:36.706 --> 05:37.672
I know.

05:37.707 --> 05:39.174
- I'm Amanda.
- Hi.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.992
Could you scootch in a sec? Twitpic.

05:41.010 --> 05:43.678
Todd has, like, 82,000 followers.

05:43.713 --> 05:45.046
No, I cannot scootch.

05:45.097 --> 05:47.465
So what hurts?

05:47.499 --> 05:49.634
Uh, you know, everywhere.

05:49.668 --> 05:51.970
(men grunting, clatter)

05:52.004 --> 05:53.638
Hey. Hey.

05:53.672 --> 05:55.023
You guys, break it up.

05:55.057 --> 05:57.025
- (grunts) Security!
- Did you hear the lady?

05:57.059 --> 05:58.693
(Alex) Security!

05:58.728 --> 06:01.196
You like that, huh?
You like that? (grunts) (grunts)

06:01.230 --> 06:02.513
(man groans)

06:02.531 --> 06:04.015
(man) All right. Get 'em out of here.

06:05.001 --> 06:07.518
It's... what I do.

06:07.536 --> 06:09.704
Get back in that bed.

06:13.292 --> 06:15.660
It's what I do.

06:20.466 --> 06:21.866
Hey, Sparky.

06:21.884 --> 06:25.203
Hey. So you're going to
Dr. Hamza's thing tonight?

06:25.221 --> 06:26.755
I was thinking we could maybe share a cab

06:26.806 --> 06:28.340
if you weren't already, um,

06:28.374 --> 06:29.808
unless you were going with, um...

06:29.842 --> 06:31.309
Who?

06:31.344 --> 06:33.044
I think you might be seeing Dr. Goran.

06:33.062 --> 06:35.263
Joel.

06:35.314 --> 06:37.048
I'm sure you'd be on a first name basis.

06:37.066 --> 06:39.351
Mm. No, I'm not.

06:39.385 --> 06:41.219
Not on a first name basis?

06:41.237 --> 06:42.654
Not seeing him.

06:42.688 --> 06:45.223
Okay. Are you sure?

06:45.241 --> 06:47.075
- Gavin...
- Because it's cool if you are. I...

06:47.109 --> 06:49.744
I'm not. Yes, I will be there,
but not till later.

06:49.779 --> 06:52.247
You can buy me a drink. Okay?

06:52.281 --> 06:54.115
Okay. Great.

06:54.166 --> 06:56.234
(singsongy) We're gonna go dancing.

06:56.252 --> 06:58.620
(hums)

06:58.671 --> 07:00.839
Todd took me out to
this Argentinean place on Harbord.

07:00.873 --> 07:02.290
Unbelievable steak.

07:02.341 --> 07:04.759
So good. Anyways,
we're walking back to the car,

07:04.794 --> 07:07.045
and this yahoo starts jawing at me.

07:07.079 --> 07:09.047
Why do people think they can
just because they see him on TV?

07:09.081 --> 07:10.965
I mean, you do as much
fighting as I do for a living,

07:11.016 --> 07:12.583
everybody and their drunk uncle

07:12.601 --> 07:14.602
- wants to take a run at you, right?
- And this guy did?

07:14.637 --> 07:16.421
Mm. It was ridiculous.
And Todd is refusing to fight back.

07:16.439 --> 07:19.557
I kind of have, like, a policy,
you know, no civilians.

07:19.591 --> 07:21.592
So we're walking away,
and he sucker punches Todd,

07:21.610 --> 07:23.728
back of the head. Todd goes down...

07:23.762 --> 07:26.314
Kicks me in the ribs. The guy takes off.

07:26.365 --> 07:28.233
I wanted to kill this guy with my shoe.

07:28.267 --> 07:30.485
And she would have, too, if I'd let her.

07:30.536 --> 07:31.953
A little crazy.

07:31.987 --> 07:33.604
(groans)

07:33.622 --> 07:35.039
That hurts?

07:35.074 --> 07:37.125
Yeah, when you're poking at it,
it does, and when I laugh

07:37.159 --> 07:39.577
and when she breathes.

07:39.611 --> 07:41.713
I think you have a cracked rib, maybe two.

07:41.747 --> 07:43.081
I'm gonna order a chest X-ray,

07:43.115 --> 07:44.999
make sure there are no punctures.

07:45.050 --> 07:46.334
Right on.

07:46.385 --> 07:49.170
What about your head?
You said that he punched you.

07:49.221 --> 07:51.423
Yeah, my head's fine.
You don't need to worry about my head.

07:51.457 --> 07:54.792
Todd, can you look at me for a second?

07:56.312 --> 07:58.213
Can you tell me what
day of the week it is?

07:58.247 --> 07:59.297
It's Saturday.

07:59.315 --> 08:00.815
And I'm gonna tell you some numbers.

08:00.850 --> 08:02.467
I want you to repeat them to me backwards.

08:02.485 --> 08:04.686
Nine, four, seven, two.

08:04.737 --> 08:06.354
We don't need to do this, Dr. Reid.

08:06.405 --> 08:08.106
- I'm worried that you have...
- Concussion.

08:08.140 --> 08:09.324
Yeah.

08:09.358 --> 08:10.942
See, that's a "c" word.

08:10.976 --> 08:12.861
I've been through this
routine before, doc.

08:12.912 --> 08:14.529
I really think we should
just leave that one alone.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.030
You need a C.T. scan.

08:16.081 --> 08:17.148
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

08:17.166 --> 08:18.333
Todd...

08:18.367 --> 08:20.585
Seriously, just-just drop it.

08:21.921 --> 08:24.372
Okay.

on in Afghanistan.

10:33.135 --> 10:35.086

10:36.138 --> 10:37.255

10:37.289 --> 10:38.789
You should boot 'em, all of 'em.

10:38.807 --> 10:42.627
I tried, but they've all got
something wrong with them.

10:42.645 --> 10:44.178
It's a nice, quiet Saturday night.

10:44.229 --> 10:45.847
Not my fault.

10:45.898 --> 10:47.465
Yes, it is. (cell phone buzzing)

10:47.483 --> 10:50.768
Olivia, I'm gonna need you
to get the cops down here.

10:56.808 --> 10:57.942
I got your page.

10:57.976 --> 11:00.161
You were right. Charlie has pneumonia.

11:03.916 --> 11:05.266
What's his temp?

11:05.301 --> 11:06.618
Just over 100. I have him sitting up.

11:06.652 --> 11:07.985
- He needs I.V. antibiotics.
- I know.

11:08.003 --> 11:09.003
You need to carpet-bomb his lungs.

11:09.038 --> 11:10.538
Melanda, it could get worse.

11:10.589 --> 11:11.673
Alex, I've got it covered.

11:11.707 --> 11:13.824
This can't happen. He could die.

11:13.842 --> 11:15.376
That won't happen. I won't do that do you.

11:15.427 --> 11:17.795
Why didn't you catch this?
What's wrong with you?

11:17.829 --> 11:22.433
It just developed.

11:26.004 --> 11:28.356
I'm sorry.

11:28.390 --> 11:30.191
I know it's not your fault.

11:31.477 --> 11:32.527

11:43.072 --> 11:44.856

11:48.243 --> 11:49.694
Hey. Get up.

11:49.712 --> 11:52.246
You.

11:52.297 --> 11:53.414
You're back.

11:53.449 --> 11:55.550
Yeah. How do I look?

11:57.019 --> 11:58.970
Uh, truthfully...

11:59.004 --> 11:59.971
- not so good.
- Ah.

12:00.005 --> 12:03.758
Um, you seem to be in a coma.

12:03.864 --> 12:04.531
Yeah?

12:04.575 --> 12:06.059
Yeah, you're not coming back from the anesthetic.

12:06.095 --> 12:08.379
My guess is you were hypotensive too long.

12:09.881 --> 12:11.349
So what's with the monkey suit?

12:11.383 --> 12:13.518
Are you, like, a funeral guy?

12:13.552 --> 12:14.769
A matter of speaking.

12:14.820 --> 12:17.772
See, that's me over there.

12:17.823 --> 12:19.357
I'm also in a coma...

12:19.391 --> 12:20.391
for the last three weeks...

12:20.409 --> 12:22.143
and I have pneumonia.

12:22.177 --> 12:23.561
Oh, no way.

12:23.595 --> 12:25.580
Yeah, take a turn for
the worse and I could die,

12:25.614 --> 12:28.032
any moment.

12:28.066 --> 12:29.701
Eddie, let me ask you something.

12:29.735 --> 12:32.120
Um, before, in surgery,
how did you pull that off?

12:32.171 --> 12:33.588
What?

12:33.622 --> 12:35.673
In the E.R., you were dead on
the table. You were a goner.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.291
And then all of a sudden, you weren't.

12:37.342 --> 12:38.593
How-how did you do that?

12:38.627 --> 12:39.910
Hey, if you learn to fight in a club

12:39.928 --> 12:41.763
and, uh, you got punched
in the face really hard,

12:41.797 --> 12:43.181
you'd go to the hospital, right?

12:43.215 --> 12:45.383
- Sure.
- Like emergency, E.R.

12:45.417 --> 12:48.052
Where is that? Is that right through here?

12:48.086 --> 12:49.554
Eddie!

12:51.106 --> 12:53.224
(laughs) These are my boys right here.

12:53.258 --> 12:54.559
What's up, gentlemen?

12:54.593 --> 12:59.197
And over here... the punk who stabbed me.

12:59.231 --> 13:01.199
Friend of yours?

13:01.233 --> 13:02.984
I'm a businessman, right?

13:03.035 --> 13:05.119
Crystal meth, a little bit of oxy.

13:05.154 --> 13:07.271
This guy starts selling in my club.

13:07.289 --> 13:09.240
I tell him to back off, and he stabs me.

13:09.274 --> 13:10.458
Makes perfect sense.

13:10.492 --> 13:11.909
Yeah, not before I broke
his fricking jaw, though.

13:11.943 --> 13:14.445
Now he can't hear or see me, right?

13:14.463 --> 13:15.663
Not a thing.

13:17.382 --> 13:18.966
I'm coming after you.

13:19.001 --> 13:22.153
As soon as I wake up,
I'm gonna return the favor

13:22.187 --> 13:24.055
and I'm gonna chop you into little pieces.

13:24.089 --> 13:25.923
You're a real sweetheart,
you know that, Eddie?

13:25.957 --> 13:28.125
Hey, I don't lose a fight, okay, not ever.

13:28.143 --> 13:31.479
And then I'm gonna come back.
I'm gonna kill your family,

13:31.513 --> 13:34.766
all of your friends,
and your stupid little dog!

13:38.437 --> 13:39.552

13:45.077 --> 13:47.662
no punctures, no bleed. You were lucky.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.997
Cool. And no treatment either, right?

13:50.032 --> 13:51.666
Just gonna give you some
medication for the pain.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.501
Perfect. Dr. Reid,
it's been a real pleasure,

13:53.535 --> 13:54.669

- But I don't like your chances.
- Todd.

14:32.741 --> 14:35.042

Tickets are in the mail.

Visceral damage?

16:53.185 --> 16:54.769
Just the liver and minor.
Missed the aorta.

16:54.803 --> 16:56.687
1/8 of an inch to the right,
she would've bled out.

16:56.722 --> 16:58.272
Bullet's lodged in the T11.

16:58.306 --> 16:59.724
Is the spinal cord transected?

16:59.775 --> 17:01.842
Can't tell from the C.T.
there's too much artifact.

17:01.860 --> 17:03.778
You gotta know how to read these things.

17:03.812 --> 17:05.279
And I don't?

17:05.313 --> 17:07.198
She's got bony fragments.

17:07.232 --> 17:10.367
It's gotta be impinging on the spine.

17:10.402 --> 17:12.069
Any family?

17:12.119 --> 17:13.487
Her husband, outside.

17:13.521 --> 17:15.406
You don't think you're
being a little hasty?

17:15.457 --> 17:16.741
Just put her in an I.C.U.

17:16.791 --> 17:18.541
Wait till she stabilizes, then operate.

17:18.577 --> 17:20.243
- Is that what you'd do?
- She's lost a lot of blood.

17:20.295 --> 17:22.029
You don't even know if her cord is intact.

17:22.047 --> 17:23.914
But hey, you're the surgeon.

17:23.964 --> 17:25.665
Yes, I am. Thank you.

17:26.935 --> 17:28.419
I'll take it from here.

17:28.470 --> 17:29.587
Good.

17:34.709 --> 17:37.395
Come on, you bastard. Die already.

17:37.429 --> 17:39.480
Sorry, bud. Your friend here is stable.

17:39.514 --> 17:41.599
Looks like he's gonna make it.

17:41.650 --> 17:42.933
He just got shot!

17:42.984 --> 17:44.235
Yeah, and the bullet went out of its way

17:44.269 --> 17:45.736
to avoid anything vital.

17:45.771 --> 17:47.738
He should be up and around
in a couple of days or so.

17:47.773 --> 17:50.891
I need to wake up.
How much longer till I wake up?

17:50.909 --> 17:52.276
Eddie, you're in a coma, okay?

17:52.327 --> 17:54.228
- Get out of my way!
- What's that?

17:54.246 --> 17:56.730
(laughs)

17:56.748 --> 17:58.365
Which way to my body? I.C.U., right?

17:58.399 --> 18:00.418
Well, I could show you.

18:00.452 --> 18:02.420
Hey, Eddie!

18:02.454 --> 18:04.255
Wr-wrong way.

18:04.289 --> 18:05.956
How much longer, detective?

18:06.007 --> 18:07.007
As long as it takes.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.759
We got a lot of patients to treat.

18:08.794 --> 18:10.044
I know you're used to
flashing that badge around,

18:10.078 --> 18:11.411
but sick people...

18:11.430 --> 18:12.880
I need more time.

18:14.349 --> 18:16.183
You're still here.

18:16.218 --> 18:17.935
Yeah, we have to give statements.

18:17.969 --> 18:19.253
They're doing Amanda first.

18:19.287 --> 18:20.971
So you're hiding out?

18:21.022 --> 18:23.190
Yes. (chuckles)

18:23.225 --> 18:25.559
You know, doc, uh,
if I were more paranoid,

18:25.593 --> 18:27.261
I would say that you
staged that entire thing

18:27.295 --> 18:28.462
just to keep me around.

18:28.497 --> 18:30.748
(chuckles)

18:30.782 --> 18:32.983
Uh-oh.

18:33.018 --> 18:34.318
Here it comes.

18:34.369 --> 18:37.271
(sighs deeply)

18:37.289 --> 18:40.074
Todd, your blood work indicated

18:40.108 --> 18:42.576
raised protein levels in your bloodstream.

18:42.610 --> 18:46.714
You tested positive for
U.C.H.L.1 and G.F.A.P.

18:46.748 --> 18:48.249
You have a concussion,

18:48.283 --> 18:49.800
a traumatic brain injury.

18:49.835 --> 18:51.635
No kidding.

18:51.670 --> 18:54.839
I'm guessing this isn't the first one.

18:54.890 --> 18:57.124
You need a C.T. scan.
We need to know what's going on.

18:57.142 --> 19:00.811
All right. (sighs) Look...

19:00.846 --> 19:01.896
(inhales deeply)

19:01.930 --> 19:03.848
My first year at junior, all right,

19:03.899 --> 19:06.350
my coach... he takes me out
for a beer after practice

19:06.401 --> 19:08.802
and he tells me, "Todd, there are two ways"

19:08.820 --> 19:11.805
"you get into the NHL. One is your talent."

19:11.823 --> 19:13.274
"The other is your fists."

19:14.976 --> 19:18.312
Then he looks me right
in the eyes and says,

19:18.330 --> 19:21.949
"Todd..."

19:21.983 --> 19:24.835
"You don't have the talent."

19:27.422 --> 19:28.923
Well...

19:28.957 --> 19:32.009
I'm 35 years old, doc.

19:32.043 --> 19:34.295
Not a bone in my body that doesn't hurt.

19:34.329 --> 19:35.880
- So stop.
- I can't.

19:35.931 --> 19:36.964
Even if it could kill you?

19:36.998 --> 19:39.300
(sighs deeply)

19:41.353 --> 19:44.722
I made it good, doc. All right?

19:44.773 --> 19:48.142
Where I come from, my family,
that just doesn't happen.

19:48.176 --> 19:49.693
Ever since day one,

19:49.728 --> 19:52.029
I've been supporting, like,
12 different people.

19:52.063 --> 19:53.847
The way I figure it

19:53.865 --> 19:57.034
is I got one, maybe two seasons left,

19:57.068 --> 19:59.537
which is why I'm asking you,

19:59.571 --> 20:02.823
like, just-just please just leave it.

20:02.857 --> 20:04.691
You don't... you don't need to...

20:04.709 --> 20:07.378
You're up. Cops are so
excited to meet you.

20:07.412 --> 20:09.129
(chuckles) Cool.

20:11.499 --> 20:14.668
It's okay. I can wait.

20:16.037 --> 20:17.171
How's it going?

20:17.205 --> 20:18.339
It's going.

20:18.373 --> 20:20.424
Anthony.

20:20.475 --> 20:22.760
I'm Dr. Goran. I'll be
operating on your wife.

20:22.811 --> 20:24.395
Oh, uh, how-how is she?

20:24.429 --> 20:26.080
Good news is, the bullet didn't
do any significant damage

20:26.114 --> 20:27.348
to her internal organs.

20:27.382 --> 20:28.548
Okay.

20:28.567 --> 20:31.385
But it has done damage to her spine.

20:31.419 --> 20:33.654
Now what I'd like to do
is to operate immediately.

20:33.688 --> 20:36.607
We decompress the spinal cord,
stabilize the spine.

20:36.658 --> 20:37.891
There are risks.

20:37.909 --> 20:39.393
Like what?

20:39.411 --> 20:41.996
She's unstable.

20:42.030 --> 20:43.831
It's a long and complicated surgery.

20:43.865 --> 20:46.533
If it doesn't go well, she could die.

20:48.003 --> 20:50.838
Now look, I've done this before,
several times,

20:50.872 --> 20:52.339
and I have been successful.

20:55.794 --> 20:57.211
Are there other options?

20:57.245 --> 20:58.796
Yes. We could wait.

20:58.847 --> 21:01.715
We could take her to the I.C.U.,
let her get her strength back,

21:01.749 --> 21:03.267
and then go in.

21:03.301 --> 21:05.085
Now this is less risky,
but in the meantime,

21:05.103 --> 21:07.187
any chance she has of
recovering function in her legs

21:07.222 --> 21:08.588
will gradually disappear.

21:08.607 --> 21:09.773
She'll be paralyzed?

21:09.808 --> 21:11.442
She could very well be in a wheelchair

21:11.476 --> 21:13.560
for the rest of her life, yes.

21:15.430 --> 21:16.397
W...

21:16.431 --> 21:17.431
We're not even from here.

21:17.449 --> 21:18.983
You know, I mean, we...

21:19.034 --> 21:21.402
come through once a month
on the way to the casino...

21:21.436 --> 21:23.904
Like I said before, Anthony,

21:23.938 --> 21:25.539
I'm confident in success.

21:28.443 --> 21:30.411
I-I need to speak with my wife, okay?

21:30.445 --> 21:32.413
Can I... can I just talk to her, please?

21:32.447 --> 21:35.266
Yeah. Of course.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.968
You should talk it over with your wife.

21:38.003 --> 21:40.421
So we're on the road, right,
this hotel in Florida.

21:40.455 --> 21:41.889
I'm on the elevator and
I got my dog with me.

21:41.923 --> 21:43.390
His name is Probert. I love my dog.

21:43.425 --> 21:44.758
Husky/lab mix.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.960
Right. The doors open up.
These two old ladies get on.

21:46.978 --> 21:48.429
They're looking all nervous, man.

21:48.463 --> 21:50.347
They see me standing there,
this big, ugly, scary dude.

21:50.398 --> 21:52.766
I got my big, ugly,
scary dog, right? (giggles)

21:52.800 --> 21:55.936
So I'm looking at Probert.
I tell him, I'm like, "sit."

21:55.970 --> 21:57.905
He doesn't listen to me,
so I'm like, "sit!"

21:57.939 --> 21:59.189
(laughs)

21:59.240 --> 22:00.974
These two old ladies, man,

22:00.992 --> 22:03.694
they sit down on
the floor in the elevator.

22:03.745 --> 22:04.811
Oh, my.

22:04.829 --> 22:07.498
So anyways, I just... (laughs)

22:07.532 --> 22:09.316
bought them dinner,
gave them tickets to the game,

22:09.334 --> 22:10.668
blah, blah, blah.

22:10.702 --> 22:12.202
But you should've seen
these old birds, man.

22:12.253 --> 22:13.504
They just sat!

22:13.538 --> 22:14.955
(Amanda laughs)

22:14.989 --> 22:16.457
Guys, if you don't mind...

22:16.491 --> 22:17.508
Thank you.

22:17.542 --> 22:19.176
Oh, cops love Todd.

22:19.210 --> 22:21.161
He always speeds. Never gets a ticket.

22:21.179 --> 22:24.014
(laughing)

22:24.049 --> 22:25.683
Babe, it's not that funny.

22:25.717 --> 22:26.684
I ca...

22:26.718 --> 22:27.834
Todd?

22:27.852 --> 22:29.002
I can't talk.

22:29.020 --> 22:30.020
Todd!

22:30.055 --> 22:31.489
Todd!

22:31.523 --> 22:33.440
- (man) Can we get some help over here?
- Babe. What's happening?

22:33.674 --> 22:36.477
Todd. Can you help him?

22:40.882 --> 22:43.400
<i>(electronic music playing)</i>

22:43.418 --> 22:45.068
You should've asked me
if I wanted a party.

22:45.086 --> 22:47.087
It was a surprise.
Shahir, if I had told you,

22:47.122 --> 22:48.622
it wouldn't have been one.

22:48.673 --> 22:50.407
We've been dating for
a year and a half? Hmm?

22:50.425 --> 22:51.959
What part of you... tell me...

22:52.010 --> 22:54.378
thought that I would like
a surprise theme party?

22:54.412 --> 22:56.597
- It's not a theme party.
- No, it's a drag show.

22:56.631 --> 22:58.015
You know what your problem is?

22:58.049 --> 22:59.516
- You're a self-hating narcissist...
- Oh, please.

22:59.551 --> 23:01.101
Who doesn't want
your alpha surgeon buddies

23:01.136 --> 23:03.771
to know that you enjoy a-a
nice drag show once in a while.

23:03.805 --> 23:06.140
It's not about gay, Victor.

23:06.191 --> 23:08.108
It's about people.

23:08.143 --> 23:10.778
Large groups of people... they...
fill me with anxiety,

23:10.812 --> 23:13.063
and the fact that you don't get that after
a year and a half... (cell phone rings)

23:13.097 --> 23:14.398
just...

23:14.432 --> 23:15.899
hospital.

23:15.933 --> 23:17.067
Of course it is.

23:21.489 --> 23:23.207
Okay. I'm on my way.

23:25.877 --> 23:27.327
Happy birthday, Shahir.

23:27.378 --> 23:29.663
Okay.

23:29.714 --> 23:32.833
(indistinct conversations)

23:32.884 --> 23:33.984
(Irene speaks indistinctly)

23:34.018 --> 23:36.120
Okay, so how are we doing?

23:36.154 --> 23:37.588
We're having a disagreement.

23:37.622 --> 23:39.356
Can you imagine me in a wheelchair?

23:39.390 --> 23:41.642
She wants to have the surgery.

23:41.676 --> 23:45.596
I say let's do this. Screw it.
Let's roll the dice.

23:45.630 --> 23:47.481
You can't win if you don't play.

23:47.515 --> 23:50.467
Sweetheart, we are
talking about your life.

23:50.485 --> 23:54.071
Dr. Goran, you've done
this procedure before?

23:54.105 --> 23:55.089
Yes.

23:55.123 --> 23:56.323
- And it worked?
- Yes.

23:56.357 --> 23:58.092
And in your opinion, it will work again?

23:58.126 --> 23:59.526
I have no reason to think that it won't.

23:59.577 --> 24:00.994
This is what she does.
You see, she browbeats.

24:01.029 --> 24:05.649
Dr. Goran, so what you're saying is

24:05.667 --> 24:08.485
if it was you,

24:08.503 --> 24:09.903
you'd have the surgery?

24:13.274 --> 24:14.708
Yes, I would.

24:14.759 --> 24:17.277
I need some more time.

24:17.312 --> 24:19.329
Can-can we please just
take a little time...

24:19.347 --> 24:21.665
Anthony.

24:21.683 --> 24:23.617
It will be okay.

24:25.053 --> 24:27.104
Dr. Goran is the expert.

24:29.941 --> 24:31.275
(Charlie) Eddie?

24:32.811 --> 24:34.111
Eddie?

24:34.145 --> 24:36.530
Where are you? You were right here.

24:36.564 --> 24:39.182
Charlie! Dude, I'm-I'm totally lost,

24:39.200 --> 24:40.851
and, uh, and that's not I.C.U. It's...

24:40.869 --> 24:42.152
No, it's not even close.

24:42.186 --> 24:43.987
So where is it?

24:44.021 --> 24:45.155
You're gonna leave a brother hanging?

24:45.189 --> 24:46.690
Well, it's down that w...

24:46.708 --> 24:48.542
Ha! Too slow!

24:48.576 --> 24:50.410
(laughs) Not fair! Not fair!

24:50.461 --> 24:53.864
Hmm. His brain is atrophied,
a number of concussions.

24:53.882 --> 24:55.833
No fractures. There's a contusion there,

24:55.867 --> 24:58.051
but that's not the cause of the bleed.

24:58.086 --> 24:59.536
Aneurysm?

24:59.554 --> 25:01.037
There's actually three.

25:01.055 --> 25:02.589
He's a walking time bomb.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.590
Is that what caused the laughing?

25:03.641 --> 25:05.208
Pseudobulbar affect.

25:05.226 --> 25:06.810
His neural pathways are disrupted.

25:06.845 --> 25:08.345
He can't control his emotions.

25:08.379 --> 25:09.930
Hell of a way to spend your birthday.

25:09.981 --> 25:12.215
Couldn't imagine anything better.

25:12.233 --> 25:14.601
Hey, champ. You ready?

25:14.652 --> 25:16.770
I take it all back.

25:16.821 --> 25:18.856
I'm kind of freaking out here.

25:18.890 --> 25:23.110
So whatever you guys gotta do,
just, I don't know, just do it.

25:23.161 --> 25:24.611
Don't worry.

25:24.662 --> 25:26.196
You're in the best hands.

25:41.913 --> 25:42.930
Here you go, doctor.

25:42.964 --> 25:44.965
Mm-hmm. Here we go.

25:47.936 --> 25:50.470
Placing the temporary clip now.

25:54.442 --> 25:57.027
There.

25:57.061 --> 25:58.145
Start the timer.

25:58.196 --> 26:00.681
(beeping)

26:03.818 --> 26:04.968
Thank you.

26:05.003 --> 26:08.622
(indistinct conversations)

26:08.656 --> 26:11.208
Amanda?

26:11.242 --> 26:13.377
He, uh, came in here
with a few bruised ribs,

26:13.411 --> 26:16.380
and now he's having brain surgery.

26:16.414 --> 26:19.549
I keep begging him to quit hockey.

26:21.636 --> 26:25.923
Dr. Reid, what am I going
to do if he doesn't wake up?

26:28.960 --> 26:30.577
I think...

26:34.899 --> 26:35.933
he will.

26:38.086 --> 26:41.655
He will. Okay.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

27:00.291 --> 27:03.543
There's a benefit to letting
the fever run its course.

27:03.594 --> 27:04.795
I know.

27:04.829 --> 27:08.048
It'll kill off bacteria,
help his defenses.

27:08.099 --> 27:09.466
We should be stingy with antibiotics.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.268
We don't know what's coming.

27:11.302 --> 27:13.120
What are you looking at?

27:13.154 --> 27:15.188
It's almost midnight.

27:15.223 --> 27:16.773
After three weeks,

27:16.808 --> 27:20.510
only 4% of coma patients
regain consciousness.

27:20.545 --> 27:22.129
As of this moment,

27:22.163 --> 27:23.730
Charlie's in week four.

27:23.781 --> 27:25.181
That's a fake deadline, and you know it.

27:25.199 --> 27:26.683
He's not in a coma anymore.

27:26.701 --> 27:29.136
- He's officially P.V.S.
- No, he isn't.

27:29.170 --> 27:30.687
Persistent vegetative state.

27:30.705 --> 27:31.688
You know what? Don't even.

27:31.706 --> 27:33.307
Nothing has changed.

27:35.827 --> 27:40.380
Besides, I like to think of
it as minimally conscious.

27:43.251 --> 27:46.253
(siren wailing in distance)

27:51.042 --> 27:52.375
(clears throat)

27:54.979 --> 27:57.314
(sighs) Who keeps
drinking all my caffeine?

27:57.348 --> 27:59.249
Maggie, guaranteed.

27:59.283 --> 28:00.901
Right.

28:00.935 --> 28:02.185
Shouldn't you be in surgery?

28:02.220 --> 28:05.221
(sighs) The husband's
refusing to sign off on this.

28:05.239 --> 28:06.857
It's just... it's ridiculous.

28:06.891 --> 28:09.609
I mean, he doesn't seem to get
it's incredibly time-sensitive.

28:09.660 --> 28:11.695
You know, if we don't decompress that...

28:11.729 --> 28:13.030
maybe he doesn't care.

28:13.064 --> 28:15.032
- He doesn't care if she can walk again?
- Yeah.

28:15.066 --> 28:17.200
I think the risks are entire manageable.

28:17.234 --> 28:18.502
Well, yeah, for you. Listen to yourself.

28:18.536 --> 28:19.836
You're just pissed off
because you wanna show off,

28:19.871 --> 28:21.288
and they're not playing along.

28:21.339 --> 28:23.590
But guess what, Joel?
This isn't about you.

28:23.624 --> 28:25.075
- Hey.
- He just wants her to live.

28:25.093 --> 28:26.093
He doesn't care what shape she's in,

28:26.127 --> 28:28.762
and any risk is too much.

28:28.796 --> 28:30.914
He just wants her to live.

28:37.321 --> 28:39.222
A-Alex!

28:45.485 --> 28:47.236
(siren wailing)

28:47.270 --> 28:49.471
So... do you wanna watch it?

28:49.489 --> 28:50.572
(door opens) Sure.

28:50.607 --> 28:52.974
Yeah? (chuckles) (chuckles)

28:52.993 --> 28:54.109
- It'll be good.
- Yeah?

28:54.143 --> 28:55.995
How are you feeling?

28:56.029 --> 28:59.581
Uh... good, I think?

28:59.616 --> 29:01.467
How'd that go for you guys?

29:01.501 --> 29:03.202
(chuckles)

29:03.253 --> 29:05.120
This is Dr. Hamza. He did your surgery.

29:05.154 --> 29:07.089
We've just been searching "brain surgery."

29:07.123 --> 29:09.858
Yeah. Yeah. It turns out
that I could have, like,

29:09.893 --> 29:12.344
a pretty fast recovery, right?

29:12.379 --> 29:14.647
I mean, a couple weeks,
I'll be right as rain.

29:14.681 --> 29:16.131
Did everything go okay?

29:16.165 --> 29:20.285
You had a brain aneurysm.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.304
In fact, you had three.
One of them ruptured,

29:22.338 --> 29:24.390
which caused a subarachnoid hemorrhage,

29:24.441 --> 29:26.191
which led to your seizure.

29:26.226 --> 29:28.277
Okay.

29:28.311 --> 29:30.863
You were lucky. It was a small one.

29:30.897 --> 29:33.115
But the problem is,
we couldn't get them all.

29:33.149 --> 29:34.349
There's one we couldn't touch,

29:34.367 --> 29:37.286
and it could burst at any time, so...

29:37.320 --> 29:38.520
You can't do anything?

29:38.555 --> 29:41.290
Well, he's gonna have to be careful.

29:41.324 --> 29:43.692
You're gonna have to be careful,
Todd, for the rest of your life.

29:43.710 --> 29:46.045
One slight knock to the head might...

29:46.079 --> 29:47.896
well, it might kill you.

29:47.931 --> 29:50.933
(sighs)

29:54.370 --> 29:56.722
Well, I guess that's why
they make helmets, right?

29:56.756 --> 30:00.175
Todd, I'm sorry.

30:00.210 --> 30:02.311
Your career is over.

30:07.517 --> 30:09.818
(indistinct conversations)

30:09.853 --> 30:12.855
(telephone ringing,
monitor beeping steadily)

30:14.407 --> 30:17.409
Still rising. 105.

30:17.444 --> 30:18.827
It'll break.

30:18.862 --> 30:20.813
Charlie's a fighter.

30:20.847 --> 30:21.847
Yeah.

30:29.289 --> 30:31.090
Hey, baby.

30:36.746 --> 30:40.682
Fight! Yo! Let's go!

30:40.717 --> 30:44.186
Don't be a little punk!
I'll mess you up! Come on!

30:44.220 --> 30:48.107
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

30:48.141 --> 30:51.593
What? It worked before.

30:51.611 --> 30:54.029
Well, keep trying. Knock yourself out.

30:54.063 --> 30:56.415
Wake up!

30:56.449 --> 30:58.066
Hey, answer me this. Say this does work.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.284
What are you gonna do then?

30:59.319 --> 31:01.436
What do you think?

31:01.454 --> 31:03.655
I'm gonna find the bitch who stabbed me,

31:03.706 --> 31:05.541
and I'm gonna kill his ass.

31:05.575 --> 31:07.743
Right, at which point
his friends are gonna find you

31:07.777 --> 31:09.711
and kill your ass.

31:09.746 --> 31:11.079
That's what I think.

31:14.167 --> 31:15.801
What do you even know about fighting?

31:15.835 --> 31:16.969
You've totally given up.

31:17.003 --> 31:18.737
No, I haven't.

31:18.772 --> 31:21.723
Really? That's, um...
That's not you giving up?

31:24.093 --> 31:25.894
Okay, tough guy.

31:25.929 --> 31:27.262
Come on. Sit up.

31:27.296 --> 31:29.297
Wake up.

31:29.315 --> 31:30.566
Come on. Get up. Fight. (claps hands)

31:30.600 --> 31:32.267
I'll mess you up. Come on!

31:32.302 --> 31:35.938
(coughing and panting)

31:35.972 --> 31:38.240
(gagging, coughing continues)

31:39.943 --> 31:41.860
Are you kidding me? Is that my vena cava?

31:41.911 --> 31:43.645
He sounds like he's back with us.

31:43.663 --> 31:45.364
(continues coughing)

31:45.415 --> 31:48.200
Okay. Settle down there.
Okay. It's all right.

31:48.251 --> 31:49.334
It's okay. I got him. All right.

31:49.369 --> 31:52.087
Eddie? Eddie, look at me.

31:52.121 --> 31:53.622
It's okay. You're okay, Eddie. (beeping)

31:53.656 --> 31:55.757
Eddie, you're all right.
Jackson, we need to sedate him.

31:55.792 --> 31:58.510
- Give me 5 milligrams of midazolam.
- (Jackson) On it.

31:58.545 --> 32:00.596
Eddie, I'm gonna take this out.

32:00.630 --> 32:03.015
Tell margaret no bingo on Tuesday.

32:03.049 --> 32:04.349
Oh, and don't forget to
change my hair appointment.

32:04.384 --> 32:05.467
The number's in the phone.

32:05.501 --> 32:07.186
Honey, we can talk about
all that later on.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.021
No, we can't, because you'll forget,

32:09.055 --> 32:10.338
and I'll be as high as a kite.

32:10.356 --> 32:12.674
Okay, I'm sorry,
but this is as far as you go.

32:12.692 --> 32:15.777
But I'll find you as soon as we're done.

32:19.282 --> 32:21.650
Hey. Come here.

32:23.653 --> 32:26.872
I love you like crazy.

32:26.906 --> 32:28.523
(kisses)

32:30.693 --> 32:31.660
(sniffles)

32:31.694 --> 32:33.128
Okay.

32:33.162 --> 32:34.880
(sighs)

32:34.914 --> 32:36.197
I love you.

32:40.169 --> 32:42.170
Dr. Goran.

32:45.225 --> 32:46.558
Don't let her die.

32:46.593 --> 32:49.177
We'll take the very best care of her.

32:49.211 --> 32:52.064
No, you don't understand.

32:52.098 --> 32:53.849
I can't-I can't lose her.

32:59.555 --> 33:01.356
(man) Richard, give me a hand, please.
(telephone rings)

33:03.743 --> 33:05.060
So we're taking an anterior approach.

33:05.078 --> 33:06.561
It's a long incision

33:06.579 --> 33:08.580
with significant anticipated blood loss.

33:08.615 --> 33:10.699
Gonna remove the ninth rib,
avoid the aorta,

33:10.733 --> 33:11.833
and get the bullet and bone fragments

33:11.868 --> 33:15.003
out of the canal. Knife, please.

33:34.924 --> 33:36.591
Dr. Goran?

33:44.951 --> 33:46.735
(sighs)

33:58.081 --> 34:01.300
Okay, change of plan.

34:01.334 --> 34:03.919
Too risky. So...

34:03.953 --> 34:06.955
posterior approach.

34:06.973 --> 34:09.474
We'll leave the bullet in.
We'll stabilize the spine,

34:09.509 --> 34:10.809
then close.

34:10.842 --> 34:11.960
Okay.

34:11.978 --> 34:13.335
She needs time.

34:13.731 --> 34:14.969
- Get your hands off me.
- Don't...

34:14.998 --> 34:15.730
I want to get out of here.

34:15.764 --> 34:17.315
- You need to get back...
- Whoa, whoa, Todd.

34:17.350 --> 34:19.134
- Seriously, don't, okay?
- You know what? Screw you. Screw you.

34:19.152 --> 34:21.320
- I'm getting out of here.
- Todd, you just had surgery.

34:21.353 --> 34:22.971
- I said get out of my face!
- Hey!

34:23.156 --> 34:26.824
This is not okay, doc. You understand?

34:28.244 --> 34:30.812
(clatter) I got nothing else in my life.

34:30.830 --> 34:32.280
Nothing!

34:32.313 --> 34:35.033
You need to get back in that bed now.

34:44.761 --> 34:46.494
He's rattled by the surgery.

34:46.512 --> 34:49.164
It's normal.

34:49.181 --> 34:50.831
Would you like me to
order restraints, Todd?

34:50.850 --> 34:51.967
Because I will.

34:52.001 --> 34:53.969
You know what, Dr. Reid?

34:54.003 --> 34:59.274
I gotta go back to
playing hockey next year,

34:59.308 --> 35:01.810
and I don't care what you think about it.

35:14.574 --> 35:17.309
What I think about it?

35:17.343 --> 35:20.212
Is you're an idiot.

35:20.246 --> 35:22.664
You're alive. You have a
life for as long as it lasts

35:22.698 --> 35:24.049
and a woman who loves you.

35:24.083 --> 35:27.869
And anyone who is breathing and conscious

35:27.887 --> 35:30.389
who can see and touch
the woman sitting next to him

35:30.423 --> 35:33.925
and turns his back on that,
on <i>her...</i>

35:36.696 --> 35:38.146
is an idiot.

35:56.379 --> 35:59.397
<i>(woman) ♪ ooh, la-la ♪</i>

35:59.432 --> 36:00.816
Not even kidding.

36:00.850 --> 36:02.217
Hey, Mags, your phone's ringing.

36:02.235 --> 36:04.152
- What?
- Your phone.

36:04.187 --> 36:05.310
Who is it?

36:07.556 --> 36:08.907
"Joel."

36:08.941 --> 36:10.108
First name basis, huh?

36:10.159 --> 36:12.027
Must be a medical consult.

36:12.061 --> 36:14.329
Yeah. He wants to play doctor with you.

36:14.363 --> 36:15.363
(beep)

36:15.397 --> 36:17.732
Dr. Goran, hello.

36:17.750 --> 36:19.701
Last call isn't till 2:00.

36:19.735 --> 36:21.837
Yeah, you should totally come by.

36:21.871 --> 36:23.839
Yeah, I'll be here.

36:23.873 --> 36:25.073
(beep) Medical consult, huh?

36:25.091 --> 36:28.593
What?

36:29.538 --> 36:30.297
Whoo!

36:30.763 --> 36:31.980
Cheers to you.

36:32.014 --> 36:34.216
<i>♪ ooh, la-la ♪</i>

36:34.250 --> 36:36.067

36:38.420 --> 36:40.806

36:55.538 --> 36:57.906
Hey, you got something to eat?
I'm starving.

36:57.940 --> 36:59.607
I'm thinking a double cheeseburger,

36:59.625 --> 37:02.627
supersize fries, maybe a chocolate shake.

37:02.662 --> 37:06.248
Really? I'm thinking jell-o,
cottage cheese.

37:09.451 --> 37:11.419
(chuckles)

37:12.621 --> 37:15.841
Come on. Let's go.

37:15.892 --> 37:18.009
I'll mess you up.

37:18.060 --> 37:19.427
Fight. Come on.

37:21.130 --> 37:23.565
(grunts) Come on!

37:23.599 --> 37:25.633
Let's go! I'm gonna mess you up!

37:29.689 --> 37:31.323
Come on, Charlie.

37:32.942 --> 37:34.276
Come on.

37:37.513 --> 37:38.947
Fight.

37:38.981 --> 37:41.766
(monitor beeping steadily,
ventilator whooshing)

37:41.801 --> 37:43.501
Fight.

38:13.950 --> 38:15.350
Melanda?

38:18.237 --> 38:19.654
Fever's broken.

38:19.688 --> 38:22.824
I was just about to call you.
He got through it, Alex.

38:22.858 --> 38:24.542
(chuckles)

38:24.577 --> 38:28.029
It's the middle of the night.
Go get some rest.

38:28.064 --> 38:29.965
Yeah.

38:29.999 --> 38:31.116
You, too.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.670
And, uh, thank you, Mel.

38:48.267 --> 38:49.517
(kisses)

39:04.083 --> 39:07.085
How'd it go?

39:07.119 --> 39:08.703
I backed off.

39:11.457 --> 39:13.008
Good.

39:13.042 --> 39:17.045
I figured that's what Charlie
would have done, right?

39:17.079 --> 39:19.547
Yeah.

39:36.449 --> 39:37.782
<i>It's a little thing called</i>

39:37.817 --> 39:39.284
<i>disseminated intravascular coagulation.</i>

39:39.318 --> 39:41.486
This guy was bleeding out of his catheter.

39:41.537 --> 39:44.072
His nasogastric line,
his endotracheal line,

39:44.106 --> 39:45.957
his, uh, his central line,

39:45.992 --> 39:50.879
and that was my very
first day as a resident.

39:52.448 --> 39:53.965
Charlie.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.785
If we didn't work together,
do you think we'd be...

39:57.803 --> 40:00.388
Yeah, I think so.

40:00.423 --> 40:02.390
I mean... it's what we have in common.

40:02.425 --> 40:04.559
We're doctors. It's our connection, right?

40:09.065 --> 40:14.686
You know you frown first
thing in the morning

40:14.737 --> 40:17.772
before you open your eyes, out of protest?

40:17.806 --> 40:20.742
And the way your voice goes soft and shy

40:20.776 --> 40:22.410
when you're nervous,

40:22.445 --> 40:26.331
And you grab hold of my hand
and you hold it real tight?

40:27.700 --> 40:30.118
'Cause you hate being nervous.

40:32.538 --> 40:36.041
The way you can start a sentence

40:36.075 --> 40:38.826
without having any idea
how it's gonna end.

40:38.844 --> 40:40.628
(laughs)

40:40.662 --> 40:42.981
(sighs)

40:43.015 --> 40:45.350
And the way you can just stop moving...

40:47.720 --> 40:51.672
and that power in your stillness.

40:54.477 --> 40:57.178
And the way you're
looking at me right now.

40:59.848 --> 41:01.866
You want me to keep going, or...

41:01.901 --> 41:04.369
I want you to call a cab.

41:04.403 --> 41:07.155
- Right now?
- Right now.

41:07.189 --> 41:08.323
- Go!
- Don't-don't...

41:08.357 --> 41:09.407
Hurry.

41:11.210 --> 41:13.161
- Hurry!
- Taxi!

41:13.195 --> 41:14.362
(laughs)

41:14.380 --> 41:16.414
<i>Taxi!</i>

41:16.465 --> 41:18.083
<i>(voice echoes) Come on, Alex.</i>

41:22.488 --> 41:24.022
<i>Alex.</i>

41:26.976 --> 41:28.676
(whispering) Charlie.

41:33.265 --> 41:34.349
Hi.

41:37.486 --> 41:39.904
(gasps)

41:39.939 --> 41:42.407
Are you okay?

41:42.441 --> 41:44.892
You look like you just saw a ghost.

41:46.662 --> 41:48.863
Charlie... he was..

41:48.897 --> 41:52.283
Charlie? He was... he was what?

41:55.638 --> 41:59.007
Nothing. I, uh, nothing.

41:59.041 --> 42:00.375
Alex, maybe you should rest.

42:00.409 --> 42:03.411
Come on. Why don't you lie
down and get some rest?

42:03.429 --> 42:05.413
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:07.099 --> 42:09.684
Try and get some sleep.

42:14.473 --> 42:15.907
I'll come wake you in half an hour.

42:15.941 --> 42:18.226
- Okay.
- Okay.
