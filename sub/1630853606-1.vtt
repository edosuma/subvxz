03:36.257 --> 03:38.509
Very handsome, this button is not buttoned

03:39.761 --> 03:41.930

05:15.023 --> 05:16.649
Don't you like me being the boss?

05:17.400 --> 05:22.196
I like it, but won't you have more time for me in the future ?

05:22.864 --> 05:27.910
Sister-in-law, do you want Nam to be Number One in Wan Chai?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.912

06:51.619 --> 06:53.329
-Brother Nam, is taking a picture.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.836
-Mr Kan Ting-chi
-Pastor Chen, are you here too?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.213

07:02.296 --> 07:04.966
-Do you know who they are?
-The owner of this bar

07:05.675 --> 07:07.468
They are from Hung Hing Society

07:07.552 --> 07:09.929
-What is Hung Hing?
-Is it a club?

07:10.012 --> 07:11.556
Isn't it your clan association?

07:12.807 --> 07:15.476
Why are you so innocent?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.019
What colour is this?

07:17.979 --> 07:18.813
Black... triad?

07:18.980 --> 07:21.065
Be careful with your image, councilor

07:21.441 --> 07:22.316
Then why are you here?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.069
I am different from you. My boss is Jesus

07:26.904 --> 07:29.365
Hello, Senator, where are you going?

07:29.449 --> 07:32.577
Let's take a picture first, on such a happy day,
come on, let's go out and take pictures

07:32.660 --> 07:34.996
-One, two, three
-Okay, come on

07:40.209 --> 07:41.711
Smile!

07:42.295 --> 07:43.963
One Two Three!

07:48.509 --> 07:50.720
Brother Nam, you have always taken care of me

07:50.803 --> 07:52.638
You won't punish me, will you?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.891
Why should I punish you?
Punishing you on such a good day?

07:54.974 --> 07:57.226
No, Brother Nam, I took a little brother

07:57.602 --> 07:59.937
How can you take in a younger brother?

08:00.146 --> 08:03.107
No, take a look first.
I can't help but take him.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.233
Where is he?

08:05.234 --> 08:06.235
Kid!

08:16.287 --> 08:17.497
Turn around and take a look

08:20.082 --> 08:21.209
They look like twins

08:21.292 --> 08:22.793
Really alike

08:22.960 --> 08:25.171
He is the son of the owner of Changji Newsstand

08:25.254 --> 08:27.965
I saw him being bullied,
so I accepted him as a little brother

08:30.218 --> 08:31.844
Tell me, what is your name?

08:32.261 --> 08:34.138
My real name
or the name given by older brother?

08:34.222 --> 08:36.891
Name given by the eldest brother!
Otherwise, what is it for?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.184
My name is Banana Peel!

08:39.185 --> 08:41.979
I call him Banana Peel, cause he's slippery!

08:42.063 --> 08:42.897
Greet Boss!

08:43.606 --> 08:44.982

-Second Uncle

08:57.036 --> 08:58.412

Really stupid!

09:06.587 --> 09:09.090
Lets settle accounts

09:09.715 --> 09:11.259
You 30% and I have 70%

09:12.260 --> 09:15.930
So as not to hurt feelings for money in the future

09:17.098 --> 09:19.100
Nam decides...

09:19.892 --> 09:20.810
...it is good

09:23.437 --> 09:24.897
You covered me for the bar

09:25.273 --> 09:27.567
I will pay it pay you back

09:28.568 --> 09:31.320
In Taiwan, if no one covered me

09:31.654 --> 09:33.114
I would only have hair to give you

09:33.197 --> 09:36.534
I really want to know who is covering you, tell me

09:38.327 --> 09:39.245
Who is it?

09:39.745 --> 09:40.705
Drink

09:42.707 --> 09:44.250
You must tell me after drinking

10:07.565 --> 10:09.859
Hello yes

10:09.942 --> 10:12.778
Is Keh Chi Wah here?

10:13.654 --> 10:16.240
Swindler Wah?

10:16.324 --> 10:19.076
Yes. that's Blackie

10:20.369 --> 10:22.455
I am his cousin

10:24.040 --> 10:25.333
From Hong Kong

10:25.791 --> 10:28.252
He uses the phone for a long time!

10:29.295 --> 10:30.171
Not here?

10:31.881 --> 10:35.968
-Have you finished?
-Have you finished?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.763
-What's up?
-We want to call

10:39.513 --> 10:40.681
Can you hurry up?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.392
-You have been using it for a long time, I'm in a hurry.
-Is this phone yours?

10:44.602 --> 10:46.979
-How can you occupy the phone for so long?
-How long will you be?

10:48.439 --> 10:51.150
-How can I take the phone for so long?
-What is he doing?

10:52.109 --> 10:54.320
Is there any "chaange"?

10:55.029 --> 10:57.281
"Chaagne"? What is "Chaange"?

10:57.448 --> 10:59.367
-how could I know?
-"chaange" in Taiwan

11:00.576 --> 11:03.037
He means "change"

11:03.162 --> 11:05.665
-Ah change
-yes, that's right

11:05.748 --> 11:06.791
Fuck you!

11:13.297 --> 11:14.340
God

11:14.882 --> 11:17.593
My name is Chicken, I am from Hong Kong

11:18.469 --> 11:21.597
I hope you bless me.  If you can heads

11:21.680 --> 11:23.849
If you can't tails

11:29.730 --> 11:31.107
Are you kidding?!

11:51.168 --> 11:52.378
Time to cash you in

11:54.296 --> 11:55.339
Quick money

11:56.424 --> 11:58.259
I can't let my cousin look down on me

11:59.301 --> 12:01.512
Brother Nam asked me to give you this Rolex

12:01.637 --> 12:04.557
You run to Taiwan now, you can take it with if you need money

12:04.640 --> 12:06.434
Misfortune or blessing

12:06.559 --> 12:08.269
It's up to you

12:09.937 --> 12:12.731
If I succeed, I will come back to redeem you

12:14.400 --> 12:15.776
Hope you bless me

12:17.528 --> 12:19.113
This watch is worth 50,000

12:19.196 --> 12:22.199
What? Fifty thousand yuan! Are you cheating me?

12:22.283 --> 12:25.411
Yes, fifty thousand, do you want?
Take it back if you don't need it

12:26.579 --> 12:29.165
Okay, hurry up, fifty thousand is fifty thousand

12:30.958 --> 12:33.711
Do you sell fake Rolex?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.004
We don't sell fake

12:35.379 --> 12:37.131
We don't buy fake

12:37.339 --> 12:41.677
Buy fakes outside.
We sell real ones here. This pawnshop does not sell fakes

12:41.760 --> 12:43.053
-No?
-No

12:43.846 --> 12:45.514
-Disguesting
-Isn't it enough?

12:45.598 --> 12:46.974
You count it!

12:49.310 --> 12:52.021
This looks real

12:52.104 --> 12:53.522
This breaks easily

12:54.815 --> 12:56.358
Why buy real?

12:59.153 --> 13:00.070
Cousin!

13:02.907 --> 13:05.201
I'm so happy to see you, how are you?

13:06.076 --> 13:07.411
Hung Hing Boy

13:07.578 --> 13:10.247
I heard you did well in Hong Kong

13:10.372 --> 13:11.916
You could say that

13:11.999 --> 13:15.002
I just killed Bill and Ba-bai

13:15.085 --> 13:17.296
It is a bit too much,
so come here to take shelter

13:17.379 --> 13:19.673
You gained fame for our family!

13:19.757 --> 13:21.759
-Betel nut?
-No....

13:22.134 --> 13:24.428
You seem to have good fortune in Taiwan

13:24.678 --> 13:27.515
-Seems to mix well?
-Of course!

13:28.140 --> 13:29.975
-Look at
-Rolex!

13:30.059 --> 13:32.603
-I'm not bad too
-Show off

13:33.187 --> 13:36.857
-how about it?
-Cousin will take you to take a bath

13:36.941 --> 13:41.070
-After taking a bath, I will take you to play...
-What?

13:41.153 --> 13:42.696
You do not understand

13:42.780 --> 13:44.490
-I'll take you to karaoke later
-OK!

13:44.573 --> 13:47.034
Okay? I'll call a few ladies to make you cool

14:42.882 --> 14:43.841
dancing!

15:00.608 --> 15:01.942
Come!

15:06.614 --> 15:09.825
-What's your name?
-Hyatt

15:11.410 --> 15:14.038
What? What's your name?

15:14.747 --> 15:16.749
-What's your name?
-Hyatt

15:17.333 --> 15:19.543
The Hyatt at the Grand Hyatt

15:19.627 --> 15:23.297
Hyatt! Hyatt at the Grand Hyatt

15:24.798 --> 15:27.134
Why do you use the name of the hotel?

15:27.551 --> 15:30.012
There are Grand Hyatts in Hong Kong and also Taipei

15:30.095 --> 15:31.805
Isn't it a nice name?

15:31.889 --> 15:35.100
There are toilets in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Why don't you call yourself Toilet?

15:35.184 --> 15:38.771
I love and hate you Hongkies

15:38.854 --> 15:41.190
Just love me, don't hate me

15:41.273 --> 15:42.483
Listen to me

15:42.566 --> 15:45.861
Christmas last year,
a Hongkie came here to visit me

15:45.945 --> 15:48.614
-He said he would give me a Rolex
-What Rolex?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.784
It's amazing, I saw a Rolex

15:51.867 --> 15:53.953
Same as yours

15:54.078 --> 15:56.664
Of course I said yes, give it to me

15:58.332 --> 16:00.250
-Listen to me
-Okay, listen!

16:00.334 --> 16:02.419
I listen! I listen to you, you

16:02.503 --> 16:04.546
I said yes, you can give it to me

16:04.630 --> 16:07.800
He said to prove that we two are in love

16:07.883 --> 16:09.301
I'll pay for half

16:09.385 --> 16:11.470
And you pay the other half

16:11.553 --> 16:13.180
Actually I don't care

16:13.263 --> 16:15.391
But, I took the watch and took a look

16:15.474 --> 16:17.309
Then I flicked hard

16:17.559 --> 16:20.646
His watch face popped out

16:21.105 --> 16:23.107
It turns out that his watch was fake

16:24.733 --> 16:27.736
How can you make me look foolish at this time?

16:31.907 --> 16:33.117
A gift for you

16:34.159 --> 16:35.077
I gotta pee

16:42.418 --> 16:44.753
Hello, where is my Hyatt?

16:45.587 --> 16:48.465
Cousin, my woman is gone

16:50.551 --> 16:52.302
-Old B
-Yes

16:52.386 --> 16:54.763
Where is my cousin's girl?
Where did she go?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.099
-Xiaoying!
-What's it called Hyatt

16:57.182 --> 16:58.559
-Xiaoying!
-Call Mamasang over

16:58.642 --> 17:00.519
Come on, why the shouting?

17:00.644 --> 17:02.396
-Hello everyone -What are you shouting?

17:02.479 --> 17:04.148
-Brother
-tell me clearly

17:04.231 --> 17:06.900
Don't be confused
about what you yelled at?

17:06.984 --> 17:09.737
- I'm sorry
-Where is Hyatt?

17:09.820 --> 17:10.696
Hyatt？

17:10.779 --> 17:13.532
Hyatt is with Mr. Zhang
he bought her to play

17:13.615 --> 17:16.201
I'm talking, are you listening?
Are you still giving me... Huh?

17:16.285 --> 17:18.787
-Which  is Zhang?
-Cousin showed you both hands today

17:18.871 --> 17:21.081
-Which Zhang?
-Mr. Zhang at that table

17:21.165 --> 17:22.750
Have something to say

17:30.507 --> 17:32.593
Who took my woman?

17:32.801 --> 17:35.596
- I am Blackie
- are you ah, sorry, misunderstood friends

17:35.721 --> 17:37.097
I did not see you

17:37.222 --> 17:38.474
You are here!

17:38.682 --> 17:40.225
Call me Xiaoying

17:40.893 --> 17:43.604
He is very powerful in the underworld

17:43.687 --> 17:46.356
He is a triad member.
We can't afford to offend him , ok?

17:46.857 --> 17:49.985
Hyatt originally sat with that gentleman

17:50.069 --> 17:52.571
Well, ask him to take her back

17:52.654 --> 17:55.282
-Yes
-sorry

17:55.365 --> 17:57.367
-Let's go, it's okay
-It's okay

17:57.451 --> 17:59.787
-Excuse me
-fuck your mother!

18:00.412 --> 18:02.498
I'll give it to you if I tell you, what's in the turtle feathers?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.418
Yes sorry

18:06.502 --> 18:09.254
Come, wake up

18:09.338 --> 18:11.757
We can't afford to offend

18:11.965 --> 18:14.593
Women are like clothes, change them daily!

18:14.676 --> 18:16.136
It doesn't matter

18:16.220 --> 18:18.806
Don't you thank Member Zhang? Thanks, say thank you

18:19.765 --> 18:21.266
Thank you, not thank you committee member Zhang?

18:21.350 --> 18:23.477
-Thank you, Member
Zhang.-Forget it, let's go

18:23.560 --> 18:26.897
I'm so sorry,
Ying, I will buy all these drinks

18:26.980 --> 18:29.942
-Okay, no problem
-I'll buy it, okay?

18:30.025 --> 18:32.111
Aying, let me tell you

18:32.319 --> 18:35.072
You can't let him pay these bills.
I'll pay for everything

18:35.155 --> 18:37.866
-I...
-Thank you

18:38.909 --> 18:41.286
Mr. Lei is running for the legislature, please greet him for me

18:41.411 --> 18:44.206
Ok thank you, i definitely will, thank you

18:46.583 --> 18:49.920
Sorry

18:50.003 --> 18:52.548
Everyone drink, keep drinking

18:52.631 --> 18:55.384
Drink more and play together, I'll go out first

18:56.802 --> 18:59.847
The San Luen Gang is the number one gang in Taiwan

18:59.930 --> 19:01.557
Established for thirty years

19:01.640 --> 19:03.559
When you see my boss later

19:03.642 --> 19:06.103
Be humble, don't brag

19:06.270 --> 19:07.479
Understood

19:07.563 --> 19:10.357
This is my boss' campaign headquarters

19:10.691 --> 19:12.359
-Cousin
-What is it?

19:12.442 --> 19:15.320
Is your boss Lei Gong really the leader of the San Luen Gang?

19:15.529 --> 19:17.865
Yes, why do you ask like that?
Higher

19:18.115 --> 19:22.369
I saw the Legislative fist fight on the Hong Kong TV news report

19:22.452 --> 19:23.829
-It's these people
-It's them?

19:23.912 --> 19:26.123
Once elected, we will be rich

19:27.082 --> 19:29.459
He's big here

19:29.543 --> 19:32.004
Of course he is Big Brother, the Big Brother of the underworld

19:32.087 --> 19:33.755
Of course he lives in a big house, fool

19:33.839 --> 19:36.300
-The underworld big brother is going to live in a big house
-Of course

19:37.176 --> 19:40.804
Mr. Lei, this is the schedule for next week.
Would you like to go over it first?

19:41.930 --> 19:44.558
When will the female reporter named Ye of the Times come?

19:45.017 --> 19:48.478
The day after tomorrow, she said that your autobiography
will be released soon.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.355
-Very good
-Good, thank you

19:52.816 --> 19:54.776
-Blackie, here you are
-Boss

19:55.360 --> 19:58.864
This is my cousin from Hong Kong, Chicken

19:58.947 --> 20:00.449
-My boss
-Boss

20:02.993 --> 20:06.246
Take them to the living room upstairs,
I will be up soon

20:09.333 --> 20:13.587
This is the boss' bodyguard.
His name is Ko Chi

20:13.670 --> 20:15.589
My cousin, Chicken

20:19.384 --> 20:20.594
He won't shake

20:20.677 --> 20:24.097
I always think he's like those American superstars

20:24.181 --> 20:25.974
Like Arnold... Sche....

20:26.058 --> 20:30.312
...newgar... he is actually stupid,
I call him a fool

20:31.939 --> 20:34.942
I lcan see all of Taipei city from here

20:35.025 --> 20:37.402
As if the world is under my feet

20:40.739 --> 20:42.115
-Sit
-OK

20:42.199 --> 20:43.158
Boss sit

20:45.953 --> 20:47.204
Have some watermelon?

20:50.666 --> 20:51.959
so rude

20:52.668 --> 20:54.253
How can you fight to eat?

20:54.628 --> 20:55.796
No rules

20:56.755 --> 20:58.548
Of course let Mr. Jiang eat first

21:00.634 --> 21:02.261
This one…

21:06.098 --> 21:07.516
You don't eat watermelon?

21:07.724 --> 21:09.059
That one…

21:10.435 --> 21:12.813
-I seldom eat Watermelon

21:13.730 --> 21:18.193
Boss asks you to eat watermelon
eat watermelon, don't mess around

21:18.277 --> 21:22.072
Blackie, I think your cousin seems smart

21:22.406 --> 21:25.200
Why is he on the run in Taiwan?

21:25.867 --> 21:29.454
The boss, he is a member of Hung Hing Society in Hong Kong

21:29.621 --> 21:32.916
Recently he made big trouble in Macau

21:33.542 --> 21:35.377
He doesn't have much money and he has no face,

21:35.460 --> 21:38.922
So he's a fugitive,
amd came to Taiwan to come to join us.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.636
-How did you expose me like this?
-What is your cousin talking about?

21:46.013 --> 21:49.099
He said he had no where to go

21:49.182 --> 21:52.853
So he really want to come to Taiwan to join us

21:53.103 --> 21:56.356
Very good, I like honest young people

21:56.481 --> 21:58.483
- Yes
-Very rare

21:58.734 --> 22:02.362
-These days, even the president doesn't speak honesty.
-Yes

22:03.739 --> 22:06.408
-Are you from Hung Hing?
-Yes

22:06.491 --> 22:10.454
A few years ago I met your boss Mr. Chiang

22:10.537 --> 22:11.496
Yes

22:13.040 --> 22:14.333
It's a deal

22:14.541 --> 22:16.710
-Thank you boss, thank you boss?
-Thank you

22:19.004 --> 22:20.881
-Thank you
-ok

22:25.927 --> 22:27.262
-Cousin
-What's wrong?

22:27.345 --> 22:29.723
Do Taiwanese triad have to wear wooden clogs?

22:30.474 --> 22:33.643
No, they're popular with Japanese triads, you know?

22:33.852 --> 22:37.522
Most of the underworld in Taiwan
love copying the Japanese triads.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.192
But it's not easy to walk on them.

22:40.275 --> 22:43.320
They're rickety, but very comfortable.
Walking, rattling, you look cool.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.447
-It's awesome, you know?
-Isn't it, majestic?

22:45.530 --> 22:48.075
Stop talking nonsense, give me a gun to defend myself

22:48.158 --> 22:51.328
-Where's the gun?
-No, don't the Taiwanese underworld have guns?

22:51.411 --> 22:52.996
I have a little gun in my pants

22:53.830 --> 22:56.333
Take this samurai sword for self-defense

22:56.416 --> 22:58.502
Isn't it, let me cut the fruit?

22:58.585 --> 23:01.713
Put it away quickly, don't let the cops see
you idiot

23:01.838 --> 23:05.300
Like we're filming Shogun movies in Japan

23:05.383 --> 23:07.135
Stop talking nonsense and go

23:11.598 --> 23:12.432
Boss

23:17.729 --> 23:19.564
-Cousin, I...-
What's the matter?

23:20.565 --> 23:23.193
I want to ask you
what exactly you do for Mr. Lei?

23:23.276 --> 23:24.319
Driver

23:26.488 --> 23:28.198
-What happened?
-So bad

23:28.281 --> 23:29.783
You are such a fool

23:29.866 --> 23:32.494
It's not bad to be a driver

23:32.577 --> 23:35.664
I know everything he says. The
most trusted person, understand?

23:35.789 --> 23:37.666
How else could I bring you in?

23:37.916 --> 23:40.627
You are stupid enough, fool!

23:40.710 --> 23:42.629
Get in the car, dog dog!

23:53.807 --> 23:57.227
Hello everyone, Lei Gong #2

23:57.310 --> 24:01.273
Lei Gong, just, fair, fair

24:01.356 --> 24:05.819
Please vote for us

24:05.902 --> 24:08.029
Lei Gong No. 2

24:08.196 --> 24:09.739
They say you are so cool

24:11.199 --> 24:12.367
Right?

24:14.744 --> 24:15.912
What are you looking at?

24:19.416 --> 24:21.626
What kind of underworld is this?

24:21.835 --> 24:23.628
Thank you

24:23.795 --> 24:24.671
Please

24:24.838 --> 24:27.215
I wish you a high vote!

24:29.593 --> 24:31.553
Are we triad?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.263
Of course

24:33.346 --> 24:36.683
Do you know that those who are big brothers in Taiwan now

24:36.766 --> 24:40.896
The triad brothers have all want to be elected legislators,
you know?

24:40.979 --> 24:43.064
Please be smart

24:43.148 --> 24:46.151
From now on, Taiwan's political circles will be ruled by the underworld

24:46.234 --> 24:48.028
We are the boss of the underworld, do you know?

24:48.111 --> 24:49.196
Thank you

24:49.279 --> 24:51.364
Today I am very happy to invite number two

24:51.448 --> 24:54.534
Lei Gong,
Mr. Lei has a speech prepared

24:55.535 --> 24:56.620
Folks

24:56.953 --> 24:59.372
Is the boss a gang leader?

24:59.456 --> 25:00.498
Don't bother me

25:01.082 --> 25:02.751
Please vote for me

25:02.876 --> 25:04.920
Can you cut the crap?

25:05.003 --> 25:06.588
But I still think...

25:07.339 --> 25:08.757
Stop talking

25:08.840 --> 25:12.385
Honestly, how could Mr. Lei be interested in
electing legislators?

25:13.011 --> 25:14.179
Do you make a lot of money?

25:14.262 --> 25:18.600
Of course, it costs millions to elect a legislator
, idiot, did you know?

25:18.683 --> 25:20.518
That's spending money, not making money?

25:20.602 --> 25:22.687
Once he's elected he can make money

25:22.771 --> 25:25.357
American democracy

25:25.482 --> 25:26.524
How?

25:28.443 --> 25:29.527
How?

25:29.653 --> 25:33.573
If I knew it, I wouldn't be a driver!
My hair is all white, fool.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.076
Drink papaya milk

25:36.701 --> 25:37.661
Papaya milk

25:39.621 --> 25:42.916
Seriously, I haven't touched a big boob in a long time

25:42.999 --> 25:43.833
Really?

25:43.917 --> 25:45.627
Yes, our family

25:45.710 --> 25:48.296
-Like to touch big tits
-Like to touch big tits

25:48.380 --> 25:51.091
Today, my cousin will take you to touch the big boobs, cheers

26:22.080 --> 26:23.498
What is this place?

26:23.957 --> 26:26.835
Here? This is Jinbaoshan

26:27.002 --> 26:30.255
Where the rich people live after they die

26:30.422 --> 26:32.424
-Jinbaoshan Mountain?
-Correct

26:32.549 --> 26:33.800
Isn't run by Sammo Hung?

26:34.718 --> 26:36.344
I didn't say that

26:36.886 --> 26:39.597
Is there Jackie Chan Mountain?

26:39.681 --> 26:41.099
Jackie Chan is over there

26:41.641 --> 26:43.351
You said so!

26:44.602 --> 26:46.980
You are so much nonsense

26:57.615 --> 26:59.743
-Hello
-You are so annoying, you

27:00.702 --> 27:03.455
-You your god-brother is talking.
-What did you say?

27:03.830 --> 27:05.874
It's rare to see him speak

27:24.601 --> 27:26.978
-Whose woman is that?
-What?

27:27.062 --> 27:28.021
That woman

27:28.104 --> 27:30.148
-Which woman?
-That's the one

27:30.357 --> 27:31.941
-The woman of the big boss-The boss
again?

27:32.025 --> 27:34.110
-The boss again? That's two...
-You don't bother me anymore

27:34.194 --> 27:35.695
Is this the concubine?

27:36.237 --> 27:37.906
Why are you so annoying?

27:42.786 --> 27:45.455
Brother, thank you for letting me come to worship your wife

27:45.872 --> 27:48.458
Xiao Yao, it's very kind of you

28:01.721 --> 28:04.099
Today is Shuxian's death anniversary

28:04.182 --> 28:07.102
Unexpectedly, you still remember clearly

28:08.395 --> 28:10.897
It's been almost eight years without knowing it

28:11.439 --> 28:13.817
I feel a lot older

28:14.567 --> 28:16.236
You look very energetic

28:17.904 --> 28:19.656
How is your life recently?

28:22.283 --> 28:24.661
I have always been jealous of Mrs. Lei

28:25.328 --> 28:27.288
Now, I envy her

28:29.124 --> 28:31.793
I saw your names are all carved on tombstones

28:32.210 --> 28:35.755
I knew I would never be able to
take her place

28:43.221 --> 28:45.724
-Do you want me to take you home?
-No thanks

28:45.890 --> 28:48.601
Chicken, take Ms Ding home

28:49.227 --> 28:50.353
Thank you

29:00.572 --> 29:02.824
My name is Chicken, cock's chicken

29:05.160 --> 29:06.578
Sorry

29:07.954 --> 29:10.665
I used to have a friend in Hong Kong

29:10.749 --> 29:12.375
He taught me to pick up girls

29:12.459 --> 29:14.377
If one meets a girl you like

29:15.170 --> 29:17.922
One must be bold, careful and thick-skinned

29:18.256 --> 29:22.135
Because if you speak up,
there are 50% success

29:22.385 --> 29:24.721
If you don't speak, chances are zero

29:26.139 --> 29:26.973
Right?

29:28.808 --> 29:30.435
This is your car?

29:32.562 --> 29:33.855
I'll take you someplace

29:39.611 --> 29:40.779
50 percent!

29:43.990 --> 29:45.492
Player wins

29:50.622 --> 29:52.373
Do you often come here to gamble?

29:53.082 --> 29:54.918
Why, don't you gamble?

29:55.835 --> 29:57.754
You have lost three

29:57.879 --> 30:00.924
The first is 10,000, the second is 20,000, and the
third is 40,000.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.801
So, the next one is 80,000

30:05.136 --> 30:07.972
If you gamble like this, you will definitely lose

30:08.932 --> 30:12.060
I don't care, I don't mind losing

30:13.186 --> 30:17.398
I just like the feeling of life and death
between winning and losing

30:19.108 --> 30:20.443
That's OK

30:21.486 --> 30:23.947
If you lose, the boss will pay

30:25.240 --> 30:28.201
I'm bored, that's why

30:28.785 --> 30:30.078
I'm elder brother's woman

30:31.496 --> 30:34.874
But 1st Brother has no interest in women anymore

30:35.959 --> 30:39.712
Only power can excite him

30:42.298 --> 30:43.299
No wonder you are bored

30:46.511 --> 30:49.681
I think your bad luck today is not your own

30:51.140 --> 30:54.811
Look at the dark, unlucky ghost with glasses opposite you

30:54.978 --> 30:58.565
If you buy the house, he buys the house, you buy the leisure, he buys the leisure

30:59.065 --> 31:01.818
I am sure he will never be rich!

31:04.153 --> 31:07.532
-What do you think should be done?

31:10.326 --> 31:13.204
-I'll bet for you
-OK

31:13.705 --> 31:17.625
-Let's see what tricks you have in Aberdeen
-No tricks

31:18.626 --> 31:21.129
If there is an unlucky ghost, let him be your beacon

31:21.838 --> 31:23.548
Will never lose

31:24.007 --> 31:26.676
He buys the house, we buy

31:27.719 --> 31:28.553
idle!

31:44.068 --> 31:45.904
I said he was unlucky a long time ago!

31:48.948 --> 31:51.117
Didn't I say that he is very back?

31:51.367 --> 31:52.994
You're pretty good

31:53.411 --> 31:55.246
Everyone in Hong Kong gambles

31:58.750 --> 32:00.209
Shall we go for dinner?

32:02.295 --> 32:03.129
Ok?

32:06.883 --> 32:09.177
Cousin, let me tell you

32:09.260 --> 32:12.597
If u want to play with a woman, go a little further, it's not good for you

32:12.680 --> 32:14.766
Why do you want to play with a woman so close to the Boss?

32:14.891 --> 32:16.225
I just chat with her

32:16.309 --> 32:19.395
You told me she's the boss' ex-girlfriend

32:19.604 --> 32:22.899
In the past tense, right?

32:23.149 --> 32:25.485
-What did you say?
-Right?

32:25.568 --> 32:29.572
I know that our family is all horny

32:30.031 --> 32:32.825
I mean that woman, not the boss, fool!

32:32.909 --> 32:34.035
What happened to that woman?

32:34.118 --> 32:36.746
Will she bite me? I love it!

32:36.829 --> 32:39.582
Bite you? Do you know how good that woman is?

32:39.666 --> 32:42.752
-How power?
-Men can't stand it, you know?

32:42.835 --> 32:43.670
Really?

32:43.753 --> 32:48.299
She has a trick specifically to tease a man's inner thigh

32:48.800 --> 32:50.468
-It's next to Jiji
-Next to it?

32:50.593 --> 32:52.887
When she squeezes it down, it feels so good...

32:52.971 --> 32:54.555
It's so cool

32:54.639 --> 32:55.682
-So smart?
-Yes

32:55.765 --> 32:57.225
I also want to try

32:57.433 --> 33:00.520
Look, there's another fight.
Didn't you just tell you last time?

33:00.603 --> 33:03.982
The Legislative Yuan fights all day in meetings, and the
chairs are also picked up to fight, you see

33:04.107 --> 33:07.360
Climbing up to get things

33:07.443 --> 33:09.362
Even female committee members fight

33:09.487 --> 33:12.448
-Women fight too
-It's Taiwan style

33:14.409 --> 33:17.829
Our boss seems to have been beaten by someone
, let's go and help.

33:21.874 --> 33:23.501
Zhang Dingkun, that lunatic

33:23.584 --> 33:25.086
-Son of a bitch!
-Boss, what's wrong?

33:25.169 --> 33:26.963
I'm fucking 18th generation ancestor!

33:27.422 --> 33:29.966
Whoever kills him will get their own Triad branch

33:30.049 --> 33:33.511
Which bastard wants to crush my boss?

34:31.819 --> 34:34.572
Thank you for your support and care

34:34.655 --> 34:36.824
I invite you all to have this meal today

34:36.908 --> 34:39.619
I'm going to be your next mayor!

34:39.786 --> 34:43.372
I hope everyone will hold hands and support me.

35:05.019 --> 35:07.271
Boss!

35:12.527 --> 35:13.486
Stop!

35:18.533 --> 35:19.492
Stop!

35:45.852 --> 35:46.936
Now boarding!

35:53.609 --> 35:54.443
Don't touch it!

36:06.998 --> 36:07.999
Thank you

36:09.125 --> 36:11.460
Hot spring water is good for you

36:11.878 --> 36:16.299
Really? I thought the Japanese were the ones with
healing springs, not Taiwan

36:18.301 --> 36:20.052
Excuse me

36:39.655 --> 36:41.115
You are so brave

36:42.241 --> 36:43.326
You are so bold

36:45.703 --> 36:48.247
It's common for men and women to bathe in Japan

36:50.082 --> 36:51.375
But this is Taiwan

36:52.668 --> 36:54.503
I am half of Japanese descent

36:55.129 --> 36:56.797
My mother is japanese

36:57.173 --> 36:58.883
Turned out to be like this

36:59.967 --> 37:01.427
My father is Taiwanese

37:01.719 --> 37:05.139
He left us when I was very young

37:08.726 --> 37:12.688
No wonder I was
watching you in Jinbaoshan that day in Japanese kimono

37:12.855 --> 37:14.649
I thought you were Japanese

37:18.402 --> 37:20.321
You said a lot that day

37:20.404 --> 37:22.865
Is it true that Hong Kong boys are like this?

37:26.410 --> 37:27.870
I don't know

37:28.537 --> 37:32.917
I deliberately made you pay attention to me that day

37:38.005 --> 37:39.757
Are there any other wounds?

37:42.218 --> 37:46.806
I think...should have...

37:46.889 --> 37:48.724
Touch it to know

37:49.558 --> 37:52.645
It would be better if you touch it for me

38:09.120 --> 38:12.748
Hey, wake up soon, the boss is coming to see you

38:14.375 --> 38:17.628
Boss?

38:20.256 --> 38:23.467
-Boss
-No need to come out

38:24.051 --> 38:27.096
-Are you OK?
-Ok

38:27.471 --> 38:30.641
That bastard surnamed Zhang,
I wanted to kill him a long time ago

38:31.642 --> 38:34.020
I hope it didn't cause you any trouble boss

38:34.228 --> 38:37.064
It's not that simple for them to check

38:38.899 --> 38:43.279
Boss, you have kind to me. I will repay that kindness.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.073
You'll be successful one day

38:47.575 --> 38:51.037
Actually I've had a question in my heart for a long time

38:51.370 --> 38:54.665
-I want to ask you
-Go ahead.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.669
You are already the leader of the San Luen Gang

38:59.545 --> 39:02.882
Why do you want to be a legislator?

39:03.758 --> 39:05.134
You sit down first

39:09.138 --> 39:11.307
Do you listen to the example of the chamber pot?

39:11.599 --> 39:14.518
-What chamber pot?
-The chamber pot is the urinal

39:15.061 --> 39:18.606
Convenient when you want to piss in the middle of the night

39:18.731 --> 39:20.524
But dirty and filthy during the day

39:20.816 --> 39:24.612
Politicians have the same view of the triad.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.655
During the day they shun us as corruption

39:26.947 --> 39:29.909
But when the night comes, they call upon our aid like helpless welps

39:30.493 --> 39:32.244
Once the sun is out, they kick us away again

39:33.704 --> 39:35.373
I can't be that chamber pot anymore

39:36.540 --> 39:38.459
So I went into politics

39:39.085 --> 39:41.337
From passive to active

39:41.670 --> 39:44.757
No wonder the triad in Hong Kong and Taiwan are so different

39:46.050 --> 39:48.677
I have a lot to learn from you

39:49.887 --> 39:52.014
Did you try it last night?

39:54.308 --> 39:57.853
-Try what?
-Don't be afraid, I don't mind

40:00.523 --> 40:01.982
I really don't know what you said

40:02.691 --> 40:04.068
I don't care about sex

40:04.860 --> 40:07.196
You are young and she also needs

40:07.405 --> 40:10.199
Love between men and women is normal

40:12.618 --> 40:15.496
-I don't have
-I can tell at a glance

40:18.791 --> 40:21.669
Ding Yao really works

40:25.631 --> 40:29.552
You can use this kid to
build a relationship with Hing Hung's Mr. Jiang

40:32.680 --> 40:35.141
You are so bold, what happened next?

40:35.724 --> 40:38.352
After that day, Mr. Lei put a lot of faith in me

40:38.811 --> 40:40.771
He made me leader of the Viper Hall

40:41.397 --> 40:45.109
Then I heard the news that
you had needed help in Hong Kong, so I rushed back

40:45.317 --> 40:47.945
Lei Gong gave me money and men

40:48.195 --> 40:49.613
You really have to thank Mr. Lei

40:52.658 --> 40:54.910
This kind of big scene is not often seen

40:54.994 --> 40:57.621
You are a newcomer
, don't talk nonsense, do you know?

40:57.705 --> 40:58.789
Understood

40:59.623 --> 41:01.667
Hey, who told you to sit down? Stand properly

41:03.419 --> 41:05.754
Nam, don't worry

41:05.963 --> 41:09.675
We in North Point and Chai Wan have
always been side by side with Causeway Bay

41:09.758 --> 41:11.469
Let Hong Kong Island prosper together

41:11.552 --> 41:13.846
Brother Ge, then you have to take care of our brother Nam

41:13.929 --> 41:16.390
Brother Nam, don't forget us

41:16.474 --> 41:19.435
The company hasn't decided yet, many things are still unknown

41:19.518 --> 41:21.145
Who else is could be Causeway Bay boss?

41:21.228 --> 41:24.023
Who else is qualified to do it besides you? joke!

41:27.485 --> 41:28.486
Kidding!

41:29.320 --> 41:32.823
Long time no see!

41:34.241 --> 41:38.662
Nam, I almost forgot to say hello
to you. Come and shake hands.

41:39.413 --> 41:42.249
It's a bit dirty, I'm sorry for this bad habit

41:44.835 --> 41:47.296
Brother, who is that person? Pick his nose like this

41:47.379 --> 41:50.382
Why are you asking so much?
Didn't I tell you to shut up?

41:52.343 --> 41:53.344
Okay

41:54.345 --> 41:57.014
It's clean, I sucked it all

41:57.806 --> 42:00.309
Today, you are the leader

42:00.434 --> 42:02.811
Let me be the ladder, okay?

42:03.062 --> 42:05.606
This piece is too difficult to dig out

42:09.568 --> 42:11.862
The business of the club is generally stable

42:12.613 --> 42:14.365
Now society is changing rapidly

42:15.115 --> 42:16.867
Recently my family bought a computer

42:16.951 --> 42:19.578
Playing on something called the Internet

42:19.745 --> 42:22.623
What net? How to play?

42:22.873 --> 42:23.958
Forget it

42:24.124 --> 42:27.461
I mean, you can't stick to the rules now.

42:28.003 --> 42:31.632
If you stay where you are,
your enemy will take two steps ahead of you

42:33.634 --> 42:37.346
Ten days ago, I reached an agreement with Mr. Ho from Macau

42:38.305 --> 42:40.140
There is a new hotel in Taipa

42:40.224 --> 42:43.143
We got the right to operate the casino inside

42:43.227 --> 42:45.771
It's really great!

42:45.854 --> 42:49.191
In addition to our other businesses,
I think we need pay a vist to Macau

42:49.316 --> 42:50.526
Sure

42:50.609 --> 42:55.281
I plan to hand over this position to the boss of Causeway Bay

42:55.447 --> 42:58.033
Mr. Jiang, Causeway Bay has no boss yet

42:58.117 --> 42:59.910
So now we have to choose someone

43:00.035 --> 43:02.538
Mr. Jiang, I have a proposal

43:02.788 --> 43:05.124
The candidate must be a righteous guy

43:05.207 --> 43:08.043
Someone who can make money and won't take money.

43:08.127 --> 43:09.795
Yes yes

43:09.878 --> 43:11.255
I suggest Tai Fai

43:11.338 --> 43:13.591
Tai Fai! Yes!

43:13.674 --> 43:14.842
Thank you for giving me face

43:14.925 --> 43:16.719
Thank you for your nomination

43:18.053 --> 43:21.181
Do not look at me and think Tai Fai is usually sloppy, sloppy, sloppy

43:21.265 --> 43:22.766
I'm not

43:22.850 --> 43:24.810
I'm a fucking boyscout

43:25.603 --> 43:28.355
I am a righteous guy!

43:28.439 --> 43:31.358
As long as I sit in this position,
I will definitely go all out

43:31.525 --> 43:32.901
Bravo...

43:33.068 --> 43:35.613
Tai Fai, many brothers support you

43:35.738 --> 43:38.032
Thank you all for your support

43:38.240 --> 43:39.491
Ok, ok, ok, ok

43:40.659 --> 43:42.411
I want to hear any other nominations?

43:42.494 --> 43:45.289
Mr. Jiang, I also have a proposal

43:45.372 --> 43:49.752
I think Nam is quite suitable for this position

43:49.835 --> 43:51.295
Yes I agree

43:51.378 --> 43:54.423
Nam has always been loyal

43:54.506 --> 43:58.969
Yes, he avenged his eldest brother Bee.
He deserves this position, right?

43:59.053 --> 44:00.387
Correct

44:00.471 --> 44:03.766
He usually treats us old guys
very well, right?

44:03.849 --> 44:06.018
-Yes
-QUIET!

44:07.686 --> 44:09.647
Don't say I'm stingy

44:09.730 --> 44:14.151
Anyone can sit in this position,
except this bastard!

44:14.234 --> 44:15.569
What are you talking about?

44:15.653 --> 44:17.905
He can't spell Righteousness? How good is he?

44:17.988 --> 44:20.699
Tai Fai, explain yourself

44:22.493 --> 44:26.288
I, Tai Fai, never talk nonsense

44:26.372 --> 44:30.209
The three rules of the rascal. Loyalty, pay your way and respect brother's women.

44:30.292 --> 44:33.295
He seduced second sister-in-law, but doesn't talk about it

44:33.379 --> 44:37.508
But even worse is he's not loyal to the brotherhood

44:38.050 --> 44:40.177
Remember my beloved brother Tong?

44:40.803 --> 44:43.597
Was he hacked to death by you? Fratricide!

44:52.773 --> 44:55.401
Yes, I killed Tong to get my promotion

44:55.484 --> 44:57.361
Is there anything wrong with this?

44:57.444 --> 45:01.782
Being a rascal, fighting and killings are nothing special.  He wasn't my friend.

45:01.865 --> 45:05.202
Did you hear that? He said it himself

45:05.577 --> 45:07.037
He's not righteous

45:07.121 --> 45:10.416
Are you qualified to be the leader of Causeway Bay?

45:10.499 --> 45:12.626
-Isn't this called unrighteous?
-Is this still loyal?

45:12.709 --> 45:13.544
Then I have nothing to say

45:19.133 --> 45:20.175
Enough trouble!

45:24.513 --> 45:27.141
This is rascals, friends become enemies become friends.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.726
Everyone fights for promotion

45:30.811 --> 45:32.020
This is too boring, right?

45:32.187 --> 45:35.232
-Yes
-Ok

45:35.399 --> 45:38.444
Are there any other besides these two nominations?

45:39.111 --> 45:41.738
No

45:41.864 --> 45:44.992
In this case, choose one of them as the boss

45:45.784 --> 45:48.996
How many clubs were Bee responsible for in Causeway Bay?

45:49.079 --> 45:52.040
We have six nightclubs, four casinos

45:53.750 --> 45:56.211
Split them equally

45:56.545 --> 46:00.674
Within one month, whoever performs better
will take over the position of Bee

46:00.757 --> 46:03.677
Mr. Jiang said so, of course it's okay

46:03.760 --> 46:06.346
Nam, do you have a problem?

46:06.472 --> 46:09.600
A one horse race is no fun, no fun at all

46:09.683 --> 46:11.435
Too boring

46:20.360 --> 46:21.195
Hold the phone!

46:23.113 --> 46:24.865
What is going on here?

46:24.948 --> 46:27.326
There is not a single living soul, is it haunted?

46:28.327 --> 46:31.538
Brother Tai Fai, nice to see you.
Two guys refuse to pay their check

46:31.622 --> 46:35.000
Dare to not pay in my club?
really interesting

46:35.083 --> 46:38.003
They must own stock in coffin companies?

46:38.962 --> 46:41.423
It's not that we won't pay, the prices are unreasonable

46:41.548 --> 46:44.218
Okay, I am a person who likes reasoning, let's talk

46:44.426 --> 46:46.053
I don't understand how you do business

46:46.136 --> 46:48.430
We were here for hours, just two girls served us

46:48.514 --> 46:49.640
Kidding?

46:49.723 --> 46:52.267
Sir, you wanted girls with good figures

46:52.392 --> 46:54.811
We gave you two girls with good figures

46:54.895 --> 46:56.563
But they are so ugly!

46:56.647 --> 46:58.690
Are you sick, brother?

46:58.815 --> 47:00.984
My girls are all famous for pretty looking

47:01.068 --> 47:03.320
Each can drink, sing, and fuck

47:03.862 --> 47:06.448
-Which two did you call to sit on the stage?
-Qingxia and Carina

47:10.827 --> 47:12.913
They are for cleaning toilets!

47:14.164 --> 47:18.377
Where did Manyu, Liti, and Feifei go?

47:18.502 --> 47:19.836
They all resigned

47:23.257 --> 47:25.217
How can you make people quit?

47:25.300 --> 47:27.719
I heard KK poached them away

47:30.597 --> 47:32.641
But you have to pay!

47:32.724 --> 47:34.851
Do you know that I run this place?

47:34.935 --> 47:36.979
But I am a very reasonable person

47:37.062 --> 47:39.064
Then let's negotiate

47:39.147 --> 47:43.110
I also think you are right not to pay

47:43.235 --> 47:46.697
I wasted hours of your time. Now I have...

47:46.780 --> 47:49.366
-No need
-Let me pay your taxi fare, sorry

47:49.449 --> 47:51.076
Sorry

47:51.243 --> 47:53.662
I'm very sorry

47:56.873 --> 47:59.501
Okay, don't be so polite

47:59.626 --> 48:03.839
I will offer you nice girls next time

48:08.760 --> 48:10.345
Where did the girls go?

48:11.430 --> 48:12.681
Nam's club

48:17.769 --> 48:19.605
What's wrong? Shy?

48:21.356 --> 48:22.858
Did you take part in it?

48:23.025 --> 48:24.610
No, Big Fai, I didn't do anything

48:25.902 --> 48:29.156
Not you?  Tell me, did you do it?

48:29.281 --> 48:32.075
-No, it's not me
-Are you bastard?

48:32.159 --> 48:32.993
Son of a bitch!

48:33.076 --> 48:35.037
-Not you?
-Boss!

48:35.120 --> 48:36.663
-Don't kill him!
-go to hell!

48:37.414 --> 48:40.208
Brother Nam, these are my good sisters

48:40.292 --> 48:45.672
This is Manyu, whose nickname is Ecstasy.
Heartthrob, amazing, right?

48:45.756 --> 48:49.593
-This is Litty, she is the invincible female wine fairy with punches.
- Hello , let's punch

48:50.177 --> 48:52.929
Awesome, right? These two are even more incredible

48:53.013 --> 48:55.849
Peerless Twins, Chanting and Feifei

48:55.932 --> 48:58.894
One is the invincible hand on the bed

48:58.977 --> 49:02.648
The other is queen of oral, isn't it amazing?

49:02.731 --> 49:04.316
-Absolutely!
-KK

49:04.399 --> 49:07.819
There are so many pretty women in our society

49:07.986 --> 49:11.114
an so many hookers here

49:11.198 --> 49:14.701
I can't see that you really have something

49:14.785 --> 49:15.911
Sure

49:16.745 --> 49:20.165
I told KK if she doesn't help Nam's club find some beautiful women

49:20.248 --> 49:22.292
I'd take Banana Peel

49:22.751 --> 49:26.963
To court Miss Hong Kong, Ma sister, Miss Asia
what sister we could get

49:27.756 --> 49:30.676
Deceive their feelings and push them into the fire pit

49:30.759 --> 49:32.090
I want to be a prostitute wrangler too!

49:32.135 --> 49:34.638
You are like a tomato, not a pimp!

49:35.180 --> 49:37.516
If you try, I won't give you an easy time

49:37.599 --> 49:38.850
I'm just talking, not really

49:38.934 --> 49:40.018
KK, please

49:40.102 --> 49:44.523
Why don't we two mamasang together

49:44.606 --> 49:47.901
Let's help Nam's club be the best in Causeway Bay

49:47.984 --> 49:51.655
That's a good idea. Sisters, let's start working

49:51.738 --> 49:53.907
-Hurry up
-Start work

49:54.700 --> 49:55.617
Start

49:56.827 --> 49:58.495
Ok wait

49:59.538 --> 50:01.707
Brother, phone

50:02.666 --> 50:03.792
Hey?

50:05.210 --> 50:08.463
Hey? Who the fuck are you fucking?

50:08.755 --> 50:09.965
who are you?

50:10.674 --> 50:11.842
Big fly

50:12.551 --> 50:14.261
What are you fucking?

50:16.263 --> 50:19.182
Are you sick? Why don't you say your mom is working for me too?

50:19.933 --> 50:20.809
What are you saying?

50:22.060 --> 50:23.103
What's the matter, brother?

50:23.687 --> 50:24.980
Where did the ladies come from?

50:26.940 --> 50:27.774
I do not know

50:38.994 --> 50:42.247
Wow, are people living here?

50:51.923 --> 50:53.759
The villas are so big

50:55.594 --> 50:57.179
Wow, there are elevators

50:58.472 --> 51:01.433
It's amazing, even the kitchen is bigger than my house

51:02.434 --> 51:03.435
Great

51:12.819 --> 51:13.904
Boss

51:16.156 --> 51:17.199
Chicken

51:17.407 --> 51:20.494
-Have things been done in Hong Kong?
-All taken care of

51:20.577 --> 51:24.039
Boss, why did you come to Macau with this Yaxing?

51:24.122 --> 51:25.665
Why not have me pick you up at the airport?

51:25.832 --> 51:28.293
There are direct flights from Taiwan to Macau

51:29.002 --> 51:31.087
The airline invited me to test the flight

51:31.171 --> 51:33.215
Ask me to give them some advice on the airline

51:33.465 --> 51:38.011
And after I bought this villa, I hardly visit

51:38.220 --> 51:40.764
I just wanted a break this time

51:41.056 --> 51:44.184
-Big shot
-Xiao Yao said to come with me

51:44.476 --> 51:48.188
I am old, sometimes a long trip makes my bones ache

51:48.688 --> 51:52.442
Xiao Yao's massage technique always rejuvenates me

51:52.526 --> 51:53.443
Come

51:54.903 --> 51:56.196
Chicken

51:56.488 --> 51:59.574
It's rare for me to come over.  Make an appointment with Mr. Jiang for me

51:59.908 --> 52:02.786
-I have not drank with him for years
-Good

52:03.286 --> 52:05.914
I can call my brother from Hong Kong, Nam

52:05.997 --> 52:07.290
Let him arrange it for us

52:10.377 --> 52:11.419
-Xiao Yao
-Yes

52:11.878 --> 52:14.714
-Have Chicken accompany you for a walk, okay?
-Alright

52:16.383 --> 52:19.511
Okay, I have an appointment with some friends from Macau.

52:20.303 --> 52:22.305
Thank you boss, thank you

52:26.768 --> 52:28.854
Why come to Macau?

52:29.104 --> 52:30.689
Surprise inspection

52:31.314 --> 52:34.693
See if you are restless and with other women

52:36.695 --> 52:37.904
Of course not

52:39.906 --> 52:41.116
Boss Lei

52:41.366 --> 52:43.326
-Hello
-Hello, long time no see

52:44.870 --> 52:47.455
See your spirit is better than before

52:47.539 --> 52:48.540
You are good too

52:48.623 --> 52:52.460
Everyone knows that you Hong Hing
is the most powerful society in Hong Kong

52:52.544 --> 52:55.088
-Really good leadership
-Come, sit down

52:56.214 --> 52:58.842
Boss Lei, not as good as you

52:58.925 --> 53:01.970
You serve as a legislator every year, serving the people

53:02.053 --> 53:03.763
I am serving myself

53:04.806 --> 53:06.641
Mr. Jiang's Mandarin is quite good

53:07.434 --> 53:08.894
I think you are also good

53:09.185 --> 53:10.228
Okay

53:10.353 --> 53:12.188
Let me be frank

53:12.272 --> 53:13.940
I want your help this time

53:14.190 --> 53:15.734
Can you help me with one thing?

53:15.817 --> 53:17.694
Go ahead

53:19.112 --> 53:19.988
OK

53:20.071 --> 53:22.365
They are bilingual and fluent in Cantonese.

53:22.574 --> 53:23.909
What I proposed

53:24.117 --> 53:26.161
Of course it's within your abilities

53:26.494 --> 53:28.496
Now Taiwan and Macau are open

53:29.080 --> 53:31.416
Thousands of tourists come to Macau every day

53:31.499 --> 53:34.753
In the future, I can guarantee that there will be more and more passengers

53:35.545 --> 53:37.756
I plan to cooperate with you

53:38.715 --> 53:40.467
I would like to join your new casino

53:41.051 --> 53:43.470
Let's share the business! We'll work together

53:44.012 --> 53:48.350
Macau is said to be more complicated than any other place in the world

53:48.516 --> 53:50.560
In addition to four major families

53:50.644 --> 53:51.937
There are Mainliand gangs

53:52.103 --> 53:55.482
The Portuguese group, and the group of officials above

53:55.690 --> 53:57.192
There are gambling ships too

53:57.275 --> 53:59.653
Including societies from Hong Kong

53:59.736 --> 54:01.905
There are a dozen groups of people

54:02.697 --> 54:04.866
Boss Lei said he wanted to buy shares

54:05.075 --> 54:06.826
Taiwan San Luen Gang arrived

54:08.119 --> 54:11.247
That would be wonderful,
make Macau like the United Nations

54:11.331 --> 54:14.459
There is no free lunch in this world

54:18.213 --> 54:21.341
Well, this is my present

54:22.425 --> 54:23.468
So much money?

54:23.551 --> 54:26.388
As for the 50% of the shares, you can arrange it for me

54:26.930 --> 54:30.141
Boss Lei, are determined to win this time

54:30.725 --> 54:32.644
I never fight a battle that is uncertain

54:32.727 --> 54:34.145
You will be disappointed this time

54:34.771 --> 54:36.731
Oh, really?

54:51.579 --> 54:54.457
- Boss
-It's not your turn to talk

55:05.552 --> 55:06.845
Are you threatening me?

55:08.513 --> 55:10.890
Mr. Jiang, I'm just threatening you

55:11.307 --> 55:13.226
You must give me an answer tonight

55:14.352 --> 55:17.522
I'm going out now, I don't believe you will shoot me

55:18.523 --> 55:21.860
If something goes wrong with the three of us, Lei Gong

55:23.403 --> 55:25.321
I promise you won't go back to Taiwan

55:49.637 --> 55:50.722
Hey

55:51.181 --> 55:53.892
KK really has a way, right?

55:54.142 --> 55:55.643
She has her way

55:56.853 --> 56:00.440
I still think that women should not intervene in man business

56:01.483 --> 56:04.027
-What happened?
-It's nothing

56:05.570 --> 56:08.198
By the way, I am very busy

56:08.948 --> 56:10.784
Better find entertainment with your friends

56:10.909 --> 56:12.118
Don't bother me

56:13.578 --> 56:15.163
You promised me

56:17.082 --> 56:19.084
When the bar opened

56:19.167 --> 56:20.668
You said you'd marry me

56:20.752 --> 56:22.378
That's what the Chicken said, I haven't said it

56:22.462 --> 56:24.798
What Chicken said has nothing to do with me.
You want to get married, find him

56:24.881 --> 56:26.591
You just want to get married, don't you?

56:54.369 --> 56:56.704
Hello, are you crying?

56:59.582 --> 57:00.416
Hey

57:02.168 --> 57:03.753
Let me show you something

57:05.130 --> 57:06.214
What is this?

57:07.382 --> 57:09.926
I bought the wedding ring long ago and hid it in the car

57:10.009 --> 57:12.345
We can get married if you find it

57:12.887 --> 57:14.222
You're so naughty!

57:15.223 --> 57:17.976
Search for it, or we can't get married

57:47.547 --> 57:48.423
Smartie

57:52.218 --> 57:54.429
Smartie

58:23.875 --> 58:27.378
Did you find the car?
You go to the second floor and ask Ah Cheng to come up right away.

58:29.923 --> 58:32.967
-Brother Nam, what's the matter with sister-in-law?
-Give me a cigarette

58:33.051 --> 58:33.885
It is bad

58:35.595 --> 58:36.638
She is in the emergency room

58:37.597 --> 58:38.848
Having an operation?

58:40.808 --> 58:43.269
The doctor is here, how is it?

58:43.937 --> 58:44.896
Doctors

58:45.146 --> 58:47.565
Miss Su received a strong blow to the head

58:47.649 --> 58:49.317
We have tried our best

58:49.567 --> 58:51.653
But she has passed the dangerous period

58:51.778 --> 58:54.405
-Almost scared to death by you.
-Can you speak clearly?

58:54.489 --> 58:57.534
Second, let go of him, he is just speaking straight

58:57.992 --> 59:00.370
However, she still hasn't woken up yet

59:00.828 --> 59:03.581
She may wake up in a day or two, or in a year or two.

59:09.337 --> 59:13.883
We don't need so many people to go in.
Why don't we pray here for the wounded?

59:14.092 --> 59:15.260
Fuck!

59:23.393 --> 59:24.477
Come bet!

59:27.480 --> 59:28.773
-Robbery!
-Do not move!

59:28.856 --> 59:29.983
Hands up!

59:30.066 --> 59:32.860
-This is Brother Nam's casino
-What are you doing?

59:32.944 --> 59:33.778
Shut up!

59:38.658 --> 59:40.326
-Do not move!
-Do not mess around

59:41.744 --> 59:43.830
-There is only one hundred thousand yuan here
-Take it!

59:44.038 --> 59:44.998
Go!

59:51.045 --> 59:53.006
-Abao, where's Nam?
-Inside

59:56.801 --> 59:57.844
Nam

59:57.969 --> 1:00:01.055
Several of our places were smashed and
even the tents were robbed

1:00:01.139 --> 1:00:02.348
Brothers are dead

1:00:06.477 --> 1:00:08.855
KK, stay here to keep Smartie company with Father Chan

1:00:13.776 --> 1:00:16.571
-Where is Chen Ho Nam?
-What are you doing, Tai Fai?

1:00:16.654 --> 1:00:18.865
I'm her for my ladies

1:00:18.948 --> 1:00:21.826
I heard KK forced them to work in your club

1:00:22.368 --> 1:00:25.204
Please tell Nam that i am here to see him

1:00:25.288 --> 1:00:27.498
-KK?
-What?  Why ask for KK

1:00:27.582 --> 1:00:28.833
Who are you to her?

1:00:28.958 --> 1:00:31.210
-Who are you to her?
-I am her boyfriend

1:00:31.294 --> 1:00:34.672
Save it, I'll beat you up sooner or later
Nam!

1:00:37.008 --> 1:00:39.135
You, take away my ladies, take away my customers

1:00:39.218 --> 1:00:41.429
Can you become the leader of Causeway Bay?

1:00:41.512 --> 1:00:44.432
Those ladies are here voluntary.
You should go reflect on yourself

1:00:44.515 --> 1:00:47.518
You need to be taught a lesson
It is a blessing or a misfortune, for you

1:00:47.602 --> 1:00:51.314
-What did you say?
-It's a blessing or a misfortune, but you can't hide it.

1:00:51.397 --> 1:00:54.150
Hey, don't mess around! Don't fight among yourself

1:00:54.233 --> 1:00:56.569
Big fly! We are in one family, don't fight

1:00:56.861 --> 1:00:59.572
My woman is in a coma

1:00:59.656 --> 1:01:01.449
If you make trouble here again, I will kill you!

1:01:01.574 --> 1:01:05.745
It's so miserable, let's just stay here

1:01:05.828 --> 1:01:07.705
It should be okay to wait for someone, right?

1:01:07.789 --> 1:01:09.290
Come, let's play football!

1:01:32.105 --> 1:01:34.232
You dare to hit my little member with a ball?

1:01:34.774 --> 1:01:36.859
No, it's not a ball

1:01:37.193 --> 1:01:39.987
It's shoes, and I'm your old man

1:01:40.071 --> 1:01:41.280
Damn, I want to beat you to death

1:01:43.741 --> 1:01:45.118
What are you doing?

1:01:46.327 --> 1:01:47.745
Are you kidding me?

1:01:48.746 --> 1:01:50.123
Brother Yao, you came just right

1:01:50.206 --> 1:01:52.417
He took away my young ladies

1:01:52.500 --> 1:01:53.668
They left by themselves

1:01:53.751 --> 1:01:56.462
Mr. Jiang asked me to tell you two candidates

1:01:57.463 --> 1:02:01.342
Don't fight, or it will only create opportunities for the police to catch you

1:02:01.592 --> 1:02:04.971
You will drag us all down

1:02:05.430 --> 1:02:08.725
Mr. Jiang also said that fair competition

1:02:09.225 --> 1:02:12.854
He wants to find a good helper,
not a troublemaker

1:02:12.937 --> 1:02:14.272
Did you hear that, Nam?

1:02:15.356 --> 1:02:17.108
Talking about you

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:18.818
Whatever you say

1:02:30.455 --> 1:02:32.415
Hey, don't fight!

1:02:38.254 --> 1:02:41.466
You fucking, don't get your own whores. Give him a severe lesson!

1:02:41.632 --> 1:02:43.384
Tai Fai, stop with the violence, what do you want?

1:02:43.468 --> 1:02:47.013
Bitch, shut up!
I haven't settled up with you yet!

1:02:47.096 --> 1:02:47.930
Drag her into the car!

1:02:48.014 --> 1:02:51.017
Help! Indecent assault! Rape!

1:02:54.312 --> 1:02:56.981
Big Fly! If you have guts, just challenge me!

1:02:57.064 --> 1:02:59.400
Are you beaten crazy? 1 versus 1 you?

1:02:59.484 --> 1:03:01.277
We are rascals,
you think this is a cowboy western?

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:04.906
This is a beating, not fair fight!
Hit him for me!

1:03:06.908 --> 1:03:08.034
Tai Fai!

1:03:16.375 --> 1:03:18.961
Stay down!
Otherwise, I will see you flat once again!

1:03:30.765 --> 1:03:31.808
Can I come in?

1:03:53.412 --> 1:03:57.083
Don't worry, if you ignore me,
I'll flick your dick

1:03:59.877 --> 1:04:01.587
Really a dog can't stop eating shit

1:04:03.756 --> 1:04:05.383
You  talk at last!

1:04:08.427 --> 1:04:10.721
-The last time...-Mr.
Jiang didn't pursue it

1:04:12.348 --> 1:04:15.268
We grew up together since childhood.
I still don't know who you are?

1:04:15.643 --> 1:04:17.186
Unexpectedly Lei Gong

1:04:18.229 --> 1:04:21.941
That old man, I thought he was old fool, he was an old fox

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:25.236
Anyway...

1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:27.989
We are good...

1:04:28.656 --> 1:04:29.824
Brothers

1:04:31.492 --> 1:04:32.660
Brothers

1:04:36.122 --> 1:04:38.207
You should have a smoke

1:04:39.292 --> 1:04:41.002
Why is it so wet?

1:04:42.044 --> 1:04:43.713
I'm used to biting the head

1:04:44.672 --> 1:04:46.299
No wonder the Smartie stutters

1:04:51.554 --> 1:04:53.431
Listen up

1:04:53.514 --> 1:04:56.183
Tai Fai, you bastard,
let go of KK soon!

1:04:56.267 --> 1:05:01.063
Listen, if you do not want her to be gang-raped

1:05:01.147 --> 1:05:03.441
No problem! I give you 24 hours

1:05:03.524 --> 1:05:06.193
Tomorrow you go steal Nam's account book and give it to me

1:05:06.444 --> 1:05:09.196
Otherwise, you won't even have a chance to collect the body

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.198
Only scum left!

1:05:12.825 --> 1:05:16.954
You bastard! Want to gang rape me?
Come on, rape me!

1:05:17.038 --> 1:05:19.040
Okay, don't squeeze it, it's about to burst!

1:05:19.123 --> 1:05:22.710
I'm your big brother, but you always bully me

1:05:23.210 --> 1:05:27.798
If I didn't scare that kid like this,
how could he steal Nam's account for me? Old girl

1:05:27.882 --> 1:05:30.217
You guys are bastards, dogs can't stop eating shit

1:05:30.301 --> 1:05:33.179
Yes, your elder brother, I'm a rascal

1:05:33.262 --> 1:05:35.723
That's why I don't like your relationship with gangsters

1:05:36.390 --> 1:05:39.393
Yee is different from others, we are playing for real

1:05:39.477 --> 1:05:40.645
So ridiculous, really screwing you

1:05:40.728 --> 1:05:43.022
While you sleep

1:05:43.105 --> 1:05:45.232
I'm your elder brother, what kind of bastards have I not seen?

1:05:45.316 --> 1:05:47.485
Fighting for power and profit

1:05:47.568 --> 1:05:50.613
They cheat no matter if they are amateur or professional

1:05:50.738 --> 1:05:54.492
He's triad! How could he be a good person?

1:05:56.452 --> 1:05:57.495
How about you?

1:05:58.454 --> 1:06:01.540
Yes, your elder brother is not a good person either

1:06:01.958 --> 1:06:05.127
I don't care if he is a good person.
The important thing is that I like him.

1:06:05.211 --> 1:06:07.964
Yeah, but don't you know

1:06:08.047 --> 1:06:10.883
9 out of 10 rascals have a sad ending

1:06:11.384 --> 1:06:13.302
So many rascals

1:06:13.803 --> 1:06:15.972
When young

1:06:16.097 --> 1:06:18.265
So famous

1:06:18.975 --> 1:06:20.726
It's very miserable when they're old

1:06:20.810 --> 1:06:23.896
Sleeping on the street, some freeze to death, some starve to death

1:06:24.814 --> 1:06:28.693
It's useless to claim to be brothers than

1:06:29.402 --> 1:06:33.447
Buy a sleeping bag, it's almost the same

1:06:40.162 --> 1:06:41.205
Buy a sleeping bag

1:06:51.841 --> 1:06:54.635
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1:06:58.848 --> 1:07:00.266
So embarrassing

1:07:00.641 --> 1:07:01.517
Are you crying?

1:07:03.811 --> 1:07:05.104
how is this possible?

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:08.524
I will rape you

1:07:09.525 --> 1:07:12.153
Let me see if you are handsome

1:07:21.829 --> 1:07:22.955
Yee

1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:25.624
-What happened to you?
-Second Uncle, why are you hurt like this?

1:07:25.708 --> 1:07:27.877
It's okay, Nam Ge asked me to get something

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:31.172
-Really okay?
-It's okay, I'm in a hurry, see you in the hospital

1:07:31.422 --> 1:07:32.256
Walk slowly

1:07:38.054 --> 1:07:40.306
Play golf with me when you have time

1:07:40.765 --> 1:07:42.516
You and Tai Fai are rushing to be the boss

1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:46.270
The whole Edo world knows about it

1:07:46.645 --> 1:07:48.105
It's the battle of the century

1:07:50.858 --> 1:07:52.651
How is the venue? How much money did you lose?

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:55.279
-More than four hundred thousand
-Really?

1:07:55.446 --> 1:07:56.989
More than four hundred thousand are really missing

1:07:57.073 --> 1:07:59.492
Those robbers said they took hundreds of thousands

1:07:59.575 --> 1:08:02.828
But will the robber tell you how much money they took?
Isn't it weird?

1:08:03.996 --> 1:08:05.581
You don't need to be so angry

1:08:05.664 --> 1:08:08.417
I was robbed of hundreds of thousands in one go.

1:08:09.210 --> 1:08:12.254
Nam, your woman went to the hospital

1:08:12.755 --> 1:08:14.090
At least 10,000 a day

1:08:14.173 --> 1:08:15.508
Mr. Jiang, you have to believe me

1:08:15.591 --> 1:08:19.845
Nam won't touch a company dime

1:08:19.970 --> 1:08:22.431
I know you very well

1:08:23.682 --> 1:08:26.560
It's like killing Tai Fai's buddy Tong

1:08:26.894 --> 1:08:28.979
You did that for the company!

1:08:30.481 --> 1:08:31.774
Tai Fai is very loyal

1:08:32.274 --> 1:08:33.734
Always protects his buddies

1:08:34.235 --> 1:08:36.070
But he was betrayed again and again

1:08:37.863 --> 1:08:40.157
It turns out that Tong was an informant for the police, he didn't even know

1:08:41.283 --> 1:08:44.453
Bee and I wanted to help him when we found out

1:08:45.913 --> 1:08:47.456
But I don't know where to start

1:08:47.957 --> 1:08:50.126
If you let his other brothers know he was taken in

1:08:50.209 --> 1:08:52.962
Isn't it embarrassing to say that my eldest brother is so stupid ?

1:08:53.420 --> 1:08:55.005
To save face

1:08:55.422 --> 1:08:57.967
I thought about it and decided to let you take care of the rat

1:08:58.634 --> 1:08:59.844
Don't mention the past

1:09:00.803 --> 1:09:03.889
This time this happened and even the account books were lost

1:09:04.431 --> 1:09:05.391
I have nothing to say

1:09:05.474 --> 1:09:07.935
Nam you lost two hundred thousand

1:09:08.018 --> 1:09:10.896
-Let's share the loss.
-Thank you Mr Jiang

1:09:12.982 --> 1:09:16.110
That bastard's hands and feet are really clean

1:09:17.611 --> 1:09:21.115
Take it, do whatever you want with it.
What a fucking bastard!

1:09:40.551 --> 1:09:41.635
What's wrong, Yee?

1:09:45.014 --> 1:09:47.391
Brother Nam, I'm sorry

1:09:48.976 --> 1:09:50.186
Actually that account book

1:09:51.478 --> 1:09:52.646
I stole it

1:09:52.771 --> 1:09:54.481
Yee was forced to do this

1:09:54.815 --> 1:09:56.692
Tai Fai lied to him that he wanted to gang rape me

1:09:57.610 --> 1:09:59.695
Actually Tai Fai is my big brother

1:10:08.913 --> 1:10:11.040
Everyone will do something wrong

1:10:13.042 --> 1:10:14.293
But don't do bad things

1:10:15.377 --> 1:10:17.087
This is from a comic book

1:10:18.631 --> 1:10:19.924
I believe my brother

1:10:21.383 --> 1:10:22.843
Doing something wrong, not doing something bad

1:10:27.181 --> 1:10:29.558
Yee, what Nam means

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:32.645
We're still brothers, I don't know who is right and who is wrong

1:10:33.771 --> 1:10:36.440
Brother Nam, kick him to Lockhart Road.

1:10:37.441 --> 1:10:38.442
It is good

1:10:39.610 --> 1:10:40.527
Stand up

1:10:41.862 --> 1:10:42.738
Stand ready

1:10:44.448 --> 1:10:45.282
Brothers

1:10:51.497 --> 1:10:52.331
Brothers

1:11:01.966 --> 1:11:02.841
Chicken

1:11:06.929 --> 1:11:10.599
He will take care of the business of the new casino in Taipa

1:11:11.225 --> 1:11:13.310
Chicken, it's up to you

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:15.145
Chicken

1:11:15.354 --> 1:11:19.275
On the opening day of your casino,
I will definitely bring some big brothers to cheer you up

1:11:19.608 --> 1:11:21.986
Satay, you are so interesting

1:11:22.361 --> 1:11:24.238
-I'm leaving now, Mr. Lei
-Bye bye

1:11:36.333 --> 1:11:37.251
Mr. Lei

1:11:40.504 --> 1:11:42.172
I don't want to manage the new casino

1:11:43.340 --> 1:11:44.466
what did you say?

1:11:47.511 --> 1:11:49.596
Hung Hing originally had the right to operate that casino

1:11:51.140 --> 1:11:53.600
I don't know how you can grab it

1:11:55.561 --> 1:11:58.397
You want me take care of it.
Why don't you teach me how to face my brothers?

1:11:58.856 --> 1:12:00.858
I can only tell you to take care of you

1:12:01.233 --> 1:12:03.694
It's the dream of many people

1:12:06.030 --> 1:12:08.782
Anyway, I can't do anything that will harm my Hung Hing brothers

1:12:09.033 --> 1:12:10.200
Anything

1:12:11.035 --> 1:12:12.536
Don't you forget

1:12:12.745 --> 1:12:14.830
You are the master of San Luen Gang's Viper Hall

1:12:14.913 --> 1:12:16.707
I don't need to be the master of Viper Hall

1:12:20.336 --> 1:12:23.881
If you don't do it, never let me see you again

1:12:31.055 --> 1:12:32.222
We have to be righteous

1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:34.975
About the benefits you have given me,

1:12:35.809 --> 1:12:36.852
grace

1:12:39.938 --> 1:12:41.315
I will always remember

1:12:42.274 --> 1:12:43.317
Get lost!

1:12:53.827 --> 1:12:55.162
I'm a stupid dog dog

1:12:56.830 --> 1:12:59.083
I thought that with the words of Chicken

1:12:59.249 --> 1:13:02.836
I could bring peace between Hong Kong and Taiwan

1:13:05.130 --> 1:13:06.924
Who knew that stealing a chicken is impossible

1:13:08.258 --> 1:13:09.218
It's shit...

1:13:10.636 --> 1:13:11.678
You dumped Lei Gong?

1:13:13.222 --> 1:13:17.267
Lei Gong, is a politician in Taiwan

1:13:18.811 --> 1:13:21.688
I said, My Chicken will not be the master of the Viper Hall

1:13:22.356 --> 1:13:23.732
Thought it would be alright, political

1:13:24.733 --> 1:13:26.235
But result is a lot of trouble

1:13:26.568 --> 1:13:30.197
But this is Hong Kong

1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:32.574
He is a stranger here

1:13:34.284 --> 1:13:36.453
He is a powerful stranger!

1:13:36.537 --> 1:13:38.038
Kill someone and run away back to Taiwan

1:13:38.288 --> 1:13:40.374
The Taiwan triads are more lethal than Hong Kong triads

1:13:40.582 --> 1:13:43.460
These people die without worry

1:13:43.627 --> 1:13:47.714
They're like the Colombians in Scarface, they'll fuck you up with a chainsaw

1:13:47.798 --> 1:13:49.591
We have done killing

1:13:49.716 --> 1:13:52.052
The most important thing is to be flexible and have a way

1:13:52.636 --> 1:13:56.515
You're pretty optimistic
I'll just marry you.

1:13:56.765 --> 1:13:57.975
Yes or No?

1:14:00.727 --> 1:14:02.646
Miss, we are closed

1:14:03.439 --> 1:14:04.481
Is Chicken here?

1:14:04.982 --> 1:14:06.400
Chicken, someone is looking for you

1:14:11.947 --> 1:14:14.324
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you

1:14:16.660 --> 1:14:17.995
Come on, Nam

1:14:20.330 --> 1:14:24.084
This is the woman I often mention to you,
Ding Yao

1:14:24.209 --> 1:14:26.628
This is my good brother, Ho Nam

1:14:26.712 --> 1:14:31.675
-Hi
-I heard that you are Hung Hing's No. 1 strong general

1:14:32.134 --> 1:14:34.428
Chicken is lucky to be your friend.

1:14:34.970 --> 1:14:36.138
You flatter me

1:14:36.930 --> 1:14:38.015
Why come here so late?

1:14:38.098 --> 1:14:41.018
Yeah, it's so late,
why are you still wearing sunglasses?

1:14:41.101 --> 1:14:42.853
-Take it off
-I'm fine

1:14:44.229 --> 1:14:46.899
What happened? Who beat you?

1:14:47.816 --> 1:14:50.277
Lei Gong has a bad temper sometimes

1:14:50.777 --> 1:14:54.490
When he hears something he doesn't like...

1:14:55.199 --> 1:14:56.325
Why did he hit you?

1:14:57.743 --> 1:14:59.953
I know he kicked you out of the San Luen Gang

1:15:01.038 --> 1:15:02.748
And is giving you trouble

1:15:03.165 --> 1:15:05.042
I had to say something nice about you

1:15:06.919 --> 1:15:08.420
Fucking bastard

1:15:08.629 --> 1:15:10.297
Do not get angry

1:15:10.756 --> 1:15:12.257
I changed his mind

1:15:12.883 --> 1:15:15.636
I told him that both tigers get hurt when they fight

1:15:15.719 --> 1:15:18.931
It's just money, just share it?

1:15:19.014 --> 1:15:20.432
He agrees with me

1:15:21.642 --> 1:15:23.894
He said he wanted to see you, with Brother Nam

1:15:25.145 --> 1:15:26.230
See me?

1:15:27.523 --> 1:15:29.816
-Where does he want to meet?
-Macao

1:15:32.653 --> 1:15:35.697
Will he order his thousands of henchmen to attack us?

1:15:38.325 --> 1:15:39.952
Do you not believe me?

1:15:42.663 --> 1:15:44.248
I don't believe you

1:15:46.083 --> 1:15:47.292
Whose hair?

1:15:51.838 --> 1:15:53.048
Not mine

1:15:55.509 --> 1:15:56.885
Is it yours?

1:16:00.973 --> 1:16:02.391
Not mine

1:16:02.891 --> 1:16:05.936
I know you like girls with long hair

1:16:09.523 --> 1:16:11.108
Wait for me to grow my hair

1:16:17.322 --> 1:16:19.241
I'm leaving now, Brother Nam, bye bye

1:16:20.492 --> 1:16:21.868
-Banana Peel!
-Yes?

1:16:22.494 --> 1:16:24.997
-Help me send Miss Ding home
-Okay

1:16:27.541 --> 1:16:30.127
Brother Nam, who is that?

1:16:30.544 --> 1:16:33.005
-Mako
-Mako?

1:16:33.964 --> 1:16:35.299
Chicken's lady?

1:16:38.343 --> 1:16:41.221
-Is Big Brother here?
-Mr. Lei is in the study, and said not to disturb him

1:16:41.305 --> 1:16:44.891
-Okay, you pour two cups of tea first, I'll call him
-Okay, right away

1:16:46.184 --> 1:16:48.270
Sit for a while, I'll go up

1:16:56.570 --> 1:17:00.115
It's been half an hour, is she in trouble?

1:17:04.578 --> 1:17:05.537
Let's take a look?

1:17:14.087 --> 1:17:15.047
Boss

1:17:19.134 --> 1:17:20.052
Fell asleep

1:17:20.218 --> 1:17:21.219
Boss

1:17:34.232 --> 1:17:37.611
-Help!
-What's up?

1:17:39.821 --> 1:17:40.906
What's up?

1:17:41.615 --> 1:17:44.785
Help! Come, my eldest brother was killed!

1:17:45.202 --> 1:17:46.244
-You murderer!
-Bitch...

1:17:46.370 --> 1:17:47.245
What tricks are you playing?

1:17:48.580 --> 1:17:51.041
-He killed Big Brother!
-Stop, or I'll stab Ding!

1:17:51.124 --> 1:17:52.000
Do not move!

1:17:53.168 --> 1:17:54.044
Do not come!

1:17:54.127 --> 1:17:55.879
-Brother is so good to you
-She framed us!

1:17:55.962 --> 1:17:57.172
-You actually killed him
-Go!

1:17:57.714 --> 1:17:59.675
-Kill me too!
-Step back!

1:18:01.551 --> 1:18:03.637
-Put down the gun!
-Put down the gun

1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:05.555
-You murderer
-Drop them now?

1:18:13.105 --> 1:18:14.106
Go that way!

1:18:43.009 --> 1:18:45.470
-Your big brother
-Isn't he joining the San Luen Gang?

1:18:47.389 --> 1:18:48.974
Do you know what you are doing?

1:18:49.224 --> 1:18:53.270
Of course I know what I'm doing,
what are you doing?

1:18:53.395 --> 1:18:54.563
Let me introduce

1:18:55.063 --> 1:18:56.815
This is my sister

1:18:56.898 --> 1:19:01.153
This is Small Potato, don't worry about him

1:19:01.236 --> 1:19:04.364
I have seen him. Where are Chicken and Ho Nam hiding?

1:19:05.365 --> 1:19:08.368
They killed our boss, and I must avenge him...

1:19:09.161 --> 1:19:10.162
Bitch!

1:19:10.912 --> 1:19:13.999
-The last time I beat you was I not cruel enough?
-This is Macau, not Wan Chai!

1:19:14.416 --> 1:19:16.251
Fuck off!

1:19:16.376 --> 1:19:18.795
Then everything you told me before had the weight of a fart!

1:19:19.129 --> 1:19:21.506
Well, I don't have a big brother anymore!

1:19:24.009 --> 1:19:26.470
I will settle accounts with you later, let's go!

1:19:27.345 --> 1:19:28.638
Be careful, Tai Fai

1:19:36.271 --> 1:19:38.690
We are all sad about the Lord Lei

1:19:40.066 --> 1:19:41.735
Lei Gong

1:19:42.027 --> 1:19:46.198
Unfortunately, he was killed by the traitor Chicken and
died in a foreign land.

1:19:46.698 --> 1:19:48.700
Lei Bangzhu left his last words

1:19:48.784 --> 1:19:51.203
If he dies or has an accident

1:19:51.328 --> 1:19:55.248
All affairs of this group will be temporarily taken over
by Ms. Ding Yao

1:19:55.582 --> 1:19:59.169
All legal procedures are handled by Lawyer Liang Zehao

1:19:59.419 --> 1:20:03.632
Elections will be held at the triennial tri-gang conference

1:20:03.715 --> 1:20:05.091
Where a new leader will emerge

1:20:32.285 --> 1:20:35.872
I've settled the influence of the San Luen Gang in TaiNam and Kaohsiung

1:20:36.331 --> 1:20:40.585
About the vacancy in the Legislative council,
I intend to be selected for a by-election candidacy

1:20:41.044 --> 1:20:42.337
I'll follow the old man's old road

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:45.423
You seem to be very excited today, and you keep talking

1:20:46.258 --> 1:20:49.761
I haven't been this happy since I became the old man's bodyguard

1:20:51.847 --> 1:20:55.308
By the way, what's your plan for the trash heap vampire?

1:20:55.892 --> 1:20:58.144
Hong Kong and Macau are not our territory

1:20:58.228 --> 1:21:00.647
It's better for us to have him

1:21:01.189 --> 1:21:02.607
Are you fond of him?

1:21:03.358 --> 1:21:07.487
Gao Jie, I have known you secretly for so many years,
don't you believe me?

1:21:09.531 --> 1:21:13.159
There used to be Chicken,
I don't want to have another one

1:21:13.493 --> 1:21:15.912
Unexpectedly, Gao Jie is six feet tall

1:21:16.204 --> 1:21:17.956
But has the confidence of a four foot tall

1:21:20.542 --> 1:21:24.212
A Yao, I still believe in you...

1:21:24.546 --> 1:21:26.756
You'll continue to be leader

1:21:26.840 --> 1:21:28.758
For now, I will be your dumb bodyguard

1:21:29.593 --> 1:21:32.846
But I want you to be dumb forever

1:21:34.806 --> 1:21:36.308
Fuck you bastard!

1:21:44.107 --> 1:21:48.194
Throw you into the sea and flush you to hell!
This guy is really lighting the toilet

1:21:48.361 --> 1:21:50.822
Fight with me for women, find shit (find death)!

1:21:51.489 --> 1:21:54.075
Then you must protect me from now on

1:21:54.534 --> 1:21:57.829
No problem, move over baby

1:21:57.913 --> 1:21:59.539
Daddy's driving

1:22:07.505 --> 1:22:09.424
-See you later, I'll go first
-OK

1:22:34.866 --> 1:22:35.700
Go!

1:22:49.756 --> 1:22:51.675
If it wasn't for my courage

1:22:51.758 --> 1:22:53.593
To jump in my underwear

1:22:53.677 --> 1:22:57.013
I'd been eating salted duck eggs with Uncle Xing and Xiao in the long ago!

1:22:57.097 --> 1:22:59.015
It's not right!

1:22:59.099 --> 1:23:01.184
The Taiwanese are going against the Hung Hing Society

1:23:01.267 --> 1:23:03.353
I think it's not against Hung Hing

1:23:03.436 --> 1:23:05.105
But against certain people

1:23:06.648 --> 1:23:09.109
Aki, does your head still hurt?

1:23:09.192 --> 1:23:13.154
Mr. Jiang, these old bones of mine won't die from such a little injury.

1:23:13.363 --> 1:23:15.240
But, I am mad for being attacked...

1:23:16.908 --> 1:23:19.369
The San Luen Gang deliberately attacked, it was premeditated

1:23:19.786 --> 1:23:21.371
Let's not blame our brothers

1:23:21.705 --> 1:23:23.248
If you need to blame someone, than me

1:23:24.791 --> 1:23:25.959
I'm the person in charge of Hung Hing

1:23:26.334 --> 1:23:28.211
Blame me for not protecting Hung Hing

1:23:28.336 --> 1:23:30.755
Also, the gambling rights of Macau casinos

1:23:31.423 --> 1:23:34.759
They spent a lot of money to buy Mr. He's cronies and we lost

1:23:35.218 --> 1:23:36.177
Mr Jiang

1:23:37.053 --> 1:23:39.139
Chicken is here today

1:23:39.806 --> 1:23:41.349
Not to say sorry to you

1:23:43.059 --> 1:23:44.686
Ho Nam is my brother

1:23:45.729 --> 1:23:47.147
As for the Macau incident

1:23:47.689 --> 1:23:48.982
I will give you an explanation

1:23:49.899 --> 1:23:53.403
Mr. Jiang, we are being bullied
we need to respond

1:23:53.862 --> 1:23:56.656
So I decided to declare war on those Taiwanese

1:23:56.740 --> 1:23:58.199
Is there any mistake, Mr. Jiang

1:23:58.283 --> 1:24:00.910
If you fight yourself, how can we have face?

1:24:00.994 --> 1:24:03.538
-Exactly
-Are you afraid I can't handle it? Do not worry

1:24:03.997 --> 1:24:07.876
Mr. Jiang,
let us do the fighting

1:24:08.793 --> 1:24:11.087
I have been framed

1:24:12.213 --> 1:24:14.257
Now, I absolutely believe in my brothers

1:24:15.967 --> 1:24:18.845
I hope you will give us two weeks to handle the matter

1:24:19.512 --> 1:24:23.433
Nam, deal with it, don't lose Hung Hing's face

1:24:30.648 --> 1:24:31.483
Father

1:24:32.650 --> 1:24:34.069
I really don't know what to do

1:24:35.653 --> 1:24:37.614
I feel so confused now

1:24:39.699 --> 1:24:41.659
One is the woman I loved

1:24:42.827 --> 1:24:43.912
But she betrayed me

1:24:46.748 --> 1:24:50.251
I feel sad

1:24:52.754 --> 1:24:54.839
But I have to stand up in front of outsiders

1:24:56.007 --> 1:24:59.385
Well, you go home and hide in the bed

1:24:59.677 --> 1:25:03.139
Crying under the quilt will make you more comfortable

1:25:03.765 --> 1:25:05.308
If only it was that simple

1:25:06.976 --> 1:25:09.813
On the other side is my good brother from childhood

1:25:10.396 --> 1:25:11.564
I must help him

1:25:14.484 --> 1:25:16.611
If he doesn't win this time, he is finished

1:25:18.571 --> 1:25:20.782
But I don't want her to lose

1:25:21.282 --> 1:25:24.953
Why do you consider winning or losing so important?

1:25:25.370 --> 1:25:26.746
Back in the day

1:25:26.913 --> 1:25:30.250
The Romans nailed Jesus Christ to the cross

1:25:30.416 --> 1:25:32.043
Watched him die

1:25:32.669 --> 1:25:34.003
They won! Right?

1:25:34.546 --> 1:25:37.507
Who knew that after three days, Jesus Christ was resurrected

1:25:37.674 --> 1:25:41.052
And spread his teachings all over the world

1:25:41.177 --> 1:25:42.262
So what?

1:25:43.471 --> 1:25:47.142
The largest Holy See, the Vatican, is also in Rome

1:25:47.475 --> 1:25:49.144
So who is the winner and who is the loser?

1:25:53.189 --> 1:25:56.067
You seems to make a point

1:25:57.527 --> 1:25:59.404
But it seems like you haven't said anything

1:26:01.781 --> 1:26:05.243
It seems...it seems to make me realize something

1:26:09.122 --> 1:26:10.832
I think I know what to do

1:26:14.544 --> 1:26:18.339
Jesus, I really didn't teach him to kill people

1:26:20.383 --> 1:26:21.593
I'm going to work

1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:27.182
Don't worry, don't worry, I won't leave you alone

1:26:28.975 --> 1:26:29.893
I thought about it

1:26:32.854 --> 1:26:34.480
I am engaged to you first

1:26:37.025 --> 1:26:38.443
I'll come back to marry you

1:26:40.737 --> 1:26:42.030
Even if you become a vegetable

1:26:42.822 --> 1:26:46.034
Still an idiot, I promised to marry you, I will marry you

1:27:12.602 --> 1:27:13.478
Bye

1:27:32.497 --> 1:27:33.748
Macau reporters are here

1:27:33.915 --> 1:27:36.042
Miss Ding, let us take a picture first!

1:27:36.125 --> 1:27:37.710
Take a picture!

1:27:37.961 --> 1:27:41.965
Miss Ding, the decoration of the casino exceeds 100 million.
How will you recover the cost?

1:27:42.340 --> 1:27:45.510
The main target of our casino is VIPs in South East Asia

1:27:45.593 --> 1:27:50.431
We have to make them feel super VIP enjoyment

1:27:50.515 --> 1:27:54.269
No expense is spared making them feel like emperors

1:27:54.352 --> 1:27:57.146
Miss Ding, do your funds come from the gangsters from Taiwan

1:27:57.313 --> 1:28:00.191
They're using your casino to launder money, is it true?

1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:03.319
These are unfounded rumors, thank you

1:28:03.861 --> 1:28:06.030
Miss Ding

1:28:06.114 --> 1:28:08.866
I'll catch the four-eyed frog in the toilet and beat him up

1:28:08.950 --> 1:28:12.829
Don't mess around, today I want everything running smooth

1:28:13.621 --> 1:28:14.831
You'll be the Boss

1:28:31.431 --> 1:28:33.057
-Miss Ding
-Hi

1:28:33.141 --> 1:28:34.934
This is our security head, Mr. Barros

1:28:35.435 --> 1:28:36.269
How are you?

1:28:36.352 --> 1:28:38.563
This is Mr. He's left and right hand, Brother Amu

1:28:38.813 --> 1:28:40.023
Thank you for coming

1:28:40.106 --> 1:28:42.483
This is Miss Davis from the Ministry of Culture

1:28:42.734 --> 1:28:43.735
Lucky meeting

1:28:43.818 --> 1:28:44.819
This is Miss Lu

1:28:45.403 --> 1:28:46.237
Hello

1:28:46.612 --> 1:28:49.282
Mr. Barros rarely attends such occasions

1:28:49.365 --> 1:28:51.117
Miss Ding, you really have face tonight

1:28:52.452 --> 1:28:54.912
Mr. Barros really saves face.
Eat together tonight?

1:28:54.996 --> 1:28:56.372
That's my honor

1:28:56.456 --> 1:28:57.749
-Please
-Thank you

1:29:02.628 --> 1:29:05.840
The pervert keeps his eyes on your tits

1:29:06.716 --> 1:29:10.428
I hate him looking at you with lustful thoughts!

1:29:11.763 --> 1:29:12.764
Tiger brother

1:29:12.847 --> 1:29:15.725
Didn't the gambling group say they'd come at 2?
It's already past 3 now

1:29:15.975 --> 1:29:17.560
I want to wait for more people to cut the ribbon

1:29:19.020 --> 1:29:20.605
Really strange

1:29:21.689 --> 1:29:23.858
-Brother Tai Fai
-What's the matter?

1:29:23.983 --> 1:29:25.735
The Jade Dragon Casino is drawing our customers

1:29:25.818 --> 1:29:28.988
They're giving triple play chips and took away our guests

1:29:29.697 --> 1:29:31.783
Don't we have a chartered plane
flying over from Taiwan?

1:29:31.908 --> 1:29:34.994
No, a bomb was dropped in the airport lobby today

1:29:35.161 --> 1:29:37.955
They received threatening calls saying that there are five bombs

1:29:38.206 --> 1:29:40.083
The police officers are searching the lobby

1:29:40.333 --> 1:29:43.836
The planes were not allowed to land, so they turned to Guangzhou

1:29:47.006 --> 1:29:50.176
Ding Ding, I really don't know what to say

1:29:50.259 --> 1:29:51.844
I thought there was only traffic chaos in Taiwan

1:29:51.928 --> 1:29:54.305
Unexpectedly, the traffic in Macau is the same

1:29:54.388 --> 1:29:57.433
Seven container trucks collided in series on the Taipa Bridge

1:29:57.517 --> 1:29:59.227
The cars are jammed

1:29:59.602 --> 1:30:01.354
Doesn't Macau have a second bridge?

1:30:01.687 --> 1:30:04.816
The second bridge is all defecate, traffic chaos

1:30:04.899 --> 1:30:06.943
The third bridge has not been built yet

1:30:08.152 --> 1:30:10.947
Where's the gambling group? Haven't you already arranged it?

1:30:11.280 --> 1:30:14.033
Brother Fai,
it's not lucky if you don't cut the ribbon

1:30:14.742 --> 1:30:18.329
No one comes, it really is unlucky

1:30:18.871 --> 1:30:20.665
Don't lose face in front of so many VIPs

1:30:21.124 --> 1:30:22.250
Cut the ribbon

1:30:31.676 --> 1:30:33.094
What's happening?

1:30:33.177 --> 1:30:34.679
Mr. Barros, I don't know

1:30:34.929 --> 1:30:37.056
-Freeze!
-What happened?

1:30:37.140 --> 1:30:39.892
Don't you welcome gamblers here?

1:30:40.810 --> 1:30:43.604
Chicken, are you looking for death?

1:30:47.191 --> 1:30:49.318
Today is your big day

1:30:51.445 --> 1:30:52.989
I don't think you will kill me right here?

1:30:53.447 --> 1:30:56.325
We welcome all sorts of gamblers

1:30:57.243 --> 1:30:59.704
But when you go out the door, you are all set for your destiny

1:30:59.787 --> 1:31:01.372
Why? Who are you scaring?

1:31:01.455 --> 1:31:04.083
KK, are you going to fight against your eldest brother?

1:31:04.250 --> 1:31:07.879
Brother, I just brought my sisters to
join you and the future sister-in-law

1:31:07.962 --> 1:31:09.964
Tai Fai, let them play

1:31:10.047 --> 1:31:13.092
Don't be rude to VIPs, let's cut the ribbon

1:31:18.514 --> 1:31:19.724
Did you hear that?

1:31:19.849 --> 1:31:21.893
Big long-haired elephant!

1:31:31.652 --> 1:31:33.613
Mr. Barros, let's cut the ribbon

1:31:33.696 --> 1:31:35.364
Miss Ding, please wait

1:31:35.448 --> 1:31:39.535
Today we are here just to give you face,
we don't want to see fighting among triad societies

1:31:39.619 --> 1:31:41.829
Otherwise, our police won't give you face

1:31:41.954 --> 1:31:44.582
-Of course
-That's good

1:31:45.208 --> 1:31:46.083
Give way

1:32:04.352 --> 1:32:06.687
-Which bastard sent it?
-I!

1:32:07.021 --> 1:32:10.107
Chicken, are you deliberately looking for trouble?

1:32:10.191 --> 1:32:11.567
What is this nonsense?

1:32:11.692 --> 1:32:13.110
Chicken has been with Lei Gong's fellow

1:32:13.236 --> 1:32:16.364
This place belongs to him.
Can't he come and play?

1:32:16.948 --> 1:32:19.450
Okay, gambling? feel free

1:32:19.533 --> 1:32:20.576
Bet

1:32:20.785 --> 1:32:22.828
Wait, I have to bet

1:32:23.829 --> 1:32:24.705
Take it!

1:32:28.876 --> 1:32:30.253
I bought a big...Thank you!

1:32:30.795 --> 1:32:31.837
What is this?

1:32:38.511 --> 1:32:39.512
What is this?

1:32:39.595 --> 1:32:41.597
-Brother, it's a grasshopper with feces!
-It stinks!

1:32:43.182 --> 1:32:45.559
-Chicken, come out and fight me!
-I challenge you?

1:32:46.811 --> 1:32:48.396
-I want to beat you for a long time!
-stop fighting!

1:33:01.701 --> 1:33:04.704
Stop! Don't fight! Stop!

1:33:05.746 --> 1:33:08.791
Ridiculous! Miss Ding, I hope you can fix this as soon as possible

1:33:09.041 --> 1:33:10.084
Mr. Barros!

1:33:18.301 --> 1:33:19.719
Mr. Barros, are you okay?

1:33:19.844 --> 1:33:22.096
Miss Ding, I want you to shut down the casino immediately

1:33:22.179 --> 1:33:24.098
Come back to the police station with me to explain things!

1:33:24.223 --> 1:33:26.642
Otherwise, you can close the doors for good

1:33:30.646 --> 1:33:34.567
-Do you want to kill him?
-How can you be security!

1:33:42.116 --> 1:33:44.952
Every place Chinese live are the same all over the world

1:33:45.036 --> 1:33:47.079
There is a way if you have money

1:33:47.538 --> 1:33:50.249
Okay, go back to open the gambling!

1:33:56.881 --> 1:33:58.632
You really don't know which way the wind blows

1:33:59.300 --> 1:34:01.427
Boy, have you eaten leopard balls?

1:34:03.262 --> 1:34:06.140
Sometimes I really admire your Hong Kong rascals

1:34:06.766 --> 1:34:09.310
Your life is really worthless

1:34:10.019 --> 1:34:11.395
Our rascals

1:34:12.188 --> 1:34:14.440
Don't die until the Yellow River

1:34:15.232 --> 1:34:17.860
Today, the San Luen Gang and Hung Hing society stor ends

1:34:17.985 --> 1:34:19.070
And you and me

1:34:20.071 --> 1:34:21.113
How dare you?

1:34:21.405 --> 1:34:22.531
Brotherhood, love and righteousness

1:34:24.408 --> 1:34:28.788
This is a public place.
If something happens, I'm not responsible.

1:34:38.005 --> 1:34:40.007
Are you threatening us with a number of people?

1:34:41.634 --> 1:34:42.468
Right

1:34:43.302 --> 1:34:45.262
I'm bullying you

1:34:45.471 --> 1:34:47.390
Your outnumbered

1:35:03.322 --> 1:35:04.240
You want to play that game?

1:35:05.116 --> 1:35:07.410
The main thing is who the barrel of the gun is pointed at

1:35:07.660 --> 1:35:09.912
Then you have to see where the gun barrel is pointing

1:35:12.915 --> 1:35:16.794
-Big Fly!
-I'm Tai Fei, the person that is usually sloppy and sloppy

1:35:16.961 --> 1:35:20.172
My women are usually mistresses and triads

1:35:20.256 --> 1:35:23.467
Suddenly there is such a beautiful woman from Taiwan

1:35:23.592 --> 1:35:26.053
I don't eat white

1:35:26.137 --> 1:35:28.347
I want to see what tricks you want to play

1:35:28.431 --> 1:35:30.933
Who knew I was forced to do undercover triad

1:35:31.016 --> 1:35:33.978
Tai Fai, if Sister Ding is injured

1:35:34.061 --> 1:35:35.479
Our triad will not let you go

1:35:35.563 --> 1:35:38.732
Brother, you guys are too easy!

1:35:38.941 --> 1:35:40.109
Ding Yao

1:35:40.234 --> 1:35:42.528
Tell them how you killed Lei Gong

1:35:42.611 --> 1:35:45.281
And then blame the Chicken and Chen Hao Nam

1:35:45.406 --> 1:35:49.535
You talk nonsense, your gun is pointed at me, it's up to you to say

1:35:49.743 --> 1:35:50.911
Do you want evidence?

1:35:55.166 --> 1:35:56.584
Fortunately my acting skills are good

1:35:56.667 --> 1:35:58.961
Pretend to push him into the sea, then find someone to rescued him

1:35:59.044 --> 1:36:00.754
Otherwise, there is really no proof

1:36:00.921 --> 1:36:03.382
Ding Yao, you are so cruel

1:36:03.716 --> 1:36:05.134
Actually want to kill me!

1:36:07.678 --> 1:36:10.806
Ding Yao, you must give us San Luen Gang
an explanation!

1:36:12.349 --> 1:36:14.101
The casino is temporarily closed!

1:36:14.477 --> 1:36:16.979
Misunderstanding between San LuenGang and Hung Hing

1:36:17.104 --> 1:36:19.398
We will fix later

1:36:19.857 --> 1:36:21.942
This person, let us bring her back to Taiwan

1:36:22.026 --> 1:36:24.945
Brother, what are you going to do with her?

1:36:25.112 --> 1:36:27.698
Of course we have to take her back to the Xing Tang to send off!

1:36:30.451 --> 1:36:32.203
I want to say one last word to her

1:36:39.668 --> 1:36:40.753
Did you know

1:36:41.337 --> 1:36:44.048
You are the favorite woman in my life?

1:37:40.854 --> 1:37:42.523
I didn't want her to be tortured

1:37:56.745 --> 1:37:58.789
Why do I get so unlucky every time I pick a girl

1:37:59.123 --> 1:38:01.917
It's not your problem, it's just unlucky coming to Macau

1:38:03.002 --> 1:38:05.838
Go back and take a bath with grapefruit leaves and you'll be fine

1:38:07.047 --> 1:38:08.799
"Darling" is a good place to take a bath

1:38:10.551 --> 1:38:12.803
I finished the undercover job

1:38:12.886 --> 1:38:15.097
The position of the boss of Causeway Bay is yours

1:38:15.514 --> 1:38:19.435
In the future, anyone against Nam Ge is against me!

1:38:19.602 --> 1:38:22.146
-Do you understand?
-Understood!

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.000
Hey it says "ED" on the screen, scrolling away... bye ED!

1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:44.269
