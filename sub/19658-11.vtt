00:14.573 --> 00:17.815
Uh, Gamora, when did we
get shag carpeting?

00:18.166 --> 00:21.893
It's not carpeting, Quill.
It's Groot.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.932
Oh, I hope we get him
to his home world soon.

00:27.009 --> 00:29.057
The dude's getting more bizarre
by the minute.

00:29.190 --> 00:32.095
Hey, give the sap-head a break.
He's happy.

00:32.191 --> 00:33.862
Now that Warlock
zapped his World Pod,

00:33.892 --> 00:36.221
he can hit the "reset" button
on his own planet.

00:36.354 --> 00:38.776
Yeah, but did he have to
do it on my ship?

00:39.766 --> 00:42.502
I am Groot!

00:44.950 --> 00:47.737
Oh, what is that
abominable stench?

00:48.018 --> 00:50.374
I am Groot!

00:50.409 --> 00:53.110
Uh, we better eat up,

00:53.145 --> 00:55.412
or things could get ugly.

01:00.473 --> 01:02.659
What were the chunks?

01:02.815 --> 01:05.909
Aw, come on.
The grass wasn't that bad.

01:06.010 --> 01:08.479
Says the creature
that eats trash.

01:08.620 --> 01:12.062
I am Groot.

01:14.266 --> 01:17.805
This planet seems familiar,
like I've been here before.

01:17.913 --> 01:21.245
Eh. You seen one scorched
cinder, you seen 'em all.

01:21.656 --> 01:23.445
I am Groot!

01:23.726 --> 01:26.547
What Mr. Sensitive here
means to say

01:26.726 --> 01:30.125
is once he drops his World Pod into
some sacred pool in the royal palace,

01:30.250 --> 01:32.312
it'll give the planet
an instant makeover.

01:32.453 --> 01:33.951
I am Groot!

01:34.086 --> 01:37.154
And his entire civilization will
sprout up and live once more.

01:37.219 --> 01:39.189
I was getting to that part.

01:41.664 --> 01:43.193
This isn't right.

01:43.369 --> 01:46.109
There's someone else here,
or some thing.

01:46.234 --> 01:50.406
Oh, come on, Gamora. What could possibly
survive in a burned-out pit like this?

01:50.641 --> 01:51.789
Symbiotes!

01:57.993 --> 02:00.293
Not the answer I was hoping for.

02:14.322 --> 02:18.197
You Symbiote snot-bags ain't
taking over this body and brain!

02:22.336 --> 02:24.305
Energy blasts won't stop them!

02:24.422 --> 02:27.336
No, but cranking up
the tunes will.

02:28.157 --> 02:30.438

Uhh...

We won't save Groot's people just
to let 'em turn into goo zombies.

03:39.851 --> 03:41.164
We have to get to the palace.

03:41.234 --> 03:44.273
Groot, where is it?
I am Groot.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.489
What, behind the scorched rocks?

03:48.575 --> 03:50.091
I am Groot!

03:50.263 --> 03:52.000
Perhaps you could be
a bit more specific.

03:58.966 --> 04:01.856
Ohh...

04:02.020 --> 04:05.114
Okay, okay, I get it now.
The palace is underground.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.630
Dude, I saw something up there.
It saved my life.

04:07.778 --> 04:11.661
- What if some of your people survived?
- I am Groot?

04:12.091 --> 04:14.418
Quill, you saw what's
left of this planet's surface.

04:14.442 --> 04:15.942
Nothing could survive that.

04:16.019 --> 04:19.161
Giving Groot false hope
is cruel and dishonorable.

04:19.302 --> 04:22.489
But... I saw something!

04:25.523 --> 04:26.867
What is all this stuff?

04:27.427 --> 04:29.927
I mean, it doesn't look
like Groot's style.

04:32.185 --> 04:35.310
No. It's Thanos' style.

04:35.731 --> 04:38.216
Now I know why this
planet looks so familiar.

04:38.395 --> 04:42.247
This was where Thanos
first weaponized Symbiotes.

04:46.177 --> 04:47.811
<i>And I was one of
his test subjects.</i>

04:47.919 --> 04:50.388
No!

05:01.170 --> 05:04.490
<i>Thanos liked what he saw...
at first.</i>

05:05.389 --> 05:06.943
<i>The feral rage,</i>

05:08.170 --> 05:10.014
<i>mindless destruction...</i>

05:10.334 --> 05:13.232
<i>I think it was the only time
I ever saw my father smile.</i>

05:13.514 --> 05:15.990
<i>Until he realized
he couldn't control his...</i>

05:16.139 --> 05:18.060
<i>weapon.</i>

05:20.402 --> 05:23.115
<i>A Symbiote had to be
mechanically de-bonded...</i>

05:23.303 --> 05:24.469
<i>painfully.</i>

05:28.529 --> 05:31.514
Thanos infected you?
On purpose?

05:31.701 --> 05:35.865
He wanted a Symbiote weapon, so he turned
a burned-out planet into a laboratory

05:35.920 --> 05:38.201
and... experimented.

05:38.451 --> 05:40.467
No wonder you knew
so much about them.

05:40.631 --> 05:43.060
When Thanos couldn't
control the Symbiotes,

05:43.121 --> 05:44.381
he abandoned the planet.

05:44.576 --> 05:46.717
And I swore I'd never come back.

05:46.808 --> 05:49.042
I am Groot.

05:49.194 --> 05:52.865
Groot, I never knew
that it was your home world.

05:53.131 --> 05:54.466
I am Groot!

05:54.685 --> 05:56.615
Whoa, whoa! Dude, don't
point that thing at me!

05:56.740 --> 05:58.620
I had even less to do
with this than Gamora did.

05:58.678 --> 06:02.568
That's not a weapon.
That's... the de-bonding device.

06:02.693 --> 06:04.075
I am Groot.

06:04.225 --> 06:05.482
Uh...

06:05.623 --> 06:07.412
I am Groot.

06:07.685 --> 06:09.881
Oh, you want to fix it?

06:10.576 --> 06:12.484
I am Groot.

06:12.816 --> 06:14.482
The wrench.

06:19.803 --> 06:21.459
I am Groot.

06:21.869 --> 06:23.232
Huh?

06:28.764 --> 06:31.193
Hmm!
Show-off.

06:32.545 --> 06:34.105
I am Groot.

06:34.271 --> 06:36.233
You can't use
this thing on Rocket.

06:36.318 --> 06:37.881
I barely survived it.

06:37.984 --> 06:40.315
I think Rocket would pick that
over being a Symbiote puppet.

06:40.339 --> 06:43.310
I am Groot.

06:51.358 --> 06:53.124
I am Groot!

07:03.033 --> 07:04.433
Clear!

07:10.701 --> 07:12.733
Sorry, Rocket.
This is for your own good.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.490
Don't move.
It'll hurt less.

07:21.365 --> 07:24.545
I am Groot.

07:29.774 --> 07:31.429
I am Groot?

07:31.855 --> 07:34.832
Any of you krutackers

07:34.878 --> 07:37.769
get the number of that freighter
that just ran me over?

07:37.887 --> 07:39.371
I am Groot!

07:39.406 --> 07:43.375
Okay. Okay. I'm alive.

07:43.410 --> 07:46.074
For now, anyway.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.019
Why would you not
be alive later?

07:48.144 --> 07:51.349
You know how them Symbiotes are
all connected to a hive mind?

07:51.574 --> 07:53.847
Well, that hive
is flargin' huge.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.980
As in the size of the whole planet.

07:56.061 --> 07:59.229
And they're all coming
after Groot's World Pod!

08:01.480 --> 08:04.457
You're saying the whole
planet is infested with Symbiotes?

08:04.590 --> 08:06.293
But how can there be so many?

08:06.527 --> 08:08.160
Thanos chose this planet

08:08.246 --> 08:10.512
because its soil was rich
with life energy.

08:10.661 --> 08:12.996
He hoped it would allow
the Symbiotes to reproduce.

08:13.152 --> 08:16.683
And now the d'ast things are
multiplying just like he wanted.

08:16.742 --> 08:19.824
All crowding around that door, trying
to get in.

08:20.004 --> 08:22.931
Fortunately,
I still got weapons.

08:23.058 --> 08:25.051
Ha-ha!

08:25.933 --> 08:27.465
Ah, flarg!

08:27.629 --> 08:30.004
This is why I don't lend my stuff
to nobody,

08:30.090 --> 08:32.605
let alone slimy,
krutackin' Symbiotes!

08:32.707 --> 08:36.332
Actually, there is one
weapon we can still use.

08:36.504 --> 08:38.144
Thanos had a fail-safe

08:38.254 --> 08:40.988
in case he couldn't remove the
Symbiotes from his test subjects,

08:41.073 --> 08:42.207
and they turned on him.

08:42.371 --> 08:44.324
A doomsday device,
powerful enough

08:44.425 --> 08:46.378
to blow up the entire planet.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.629
Are you out of your mind?
This is Groot's home!

08:48.777 --> 08:51.176
I am Groot!
I know. I know.

08:51.301 --> 08:53.480
But we can't just leave
a planet full of Symbiotes

08:53.582 --> 08:57.230
floating around the galaxy, waiting
for a ride to an inhabited world.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.971
Sure we can. Look, we
go back to the <i> Milano,</i>

09:00.058 --> 09:02.394
and we leave the planet
exactly like we found it.

09:02.574 --> 09:04.706
Not our problem.

09:04.824 --> 09:08.215
Quill, that's the first sensible
thing you've said, ever.

09:08.722 --> 09:11.535
I am Groot.

09:12.254 --> 09:13.296
He wants you to know

09:13.324 --> 09:16.363
he'd rather see his home world
destroyed than abandon it to...

09:16.596 --> 09:19.301
Well, I can't exactly translate.

09:19.379 --> 09:22.964
Let's just say he really
hates those slimeballs.

09:24.426 --> 09:25.850
Okay, pal.

09:26.035 --> 09:27.796
Your planet, your call.

09:30.355 --> 09:33.835
There's an elevator that will take
us down to the doomsday device.

09:39.534 --> 09:41.402
The main reactor
is in the large chamber,

09:41.488 --> 09:44.269
but there are quantum charges
throughout these tunnels.

09:47.363 --> 09:52.198
I'll say one thing for Thanos:
He don't skimp on the hardware.

09:52.401 --> 09:53.988
I am Groot.

09:54.151 --> 09:58.558
What? A guy can't have a moment
with a billion-taraton explosive?

10:07.120 --> 10:08.981
I'm giving us 20 minutes
to get outta here.

10:09.073 --> 10:12.347
If we ain't on the <i> Milano</i> by then, the
slimeballs will have gotten us anyways.

10:12.495 --> 10:15.110
You sure about this, bud?

10:15.145 --> 10:17.088
I can't shut this thing down.

10:17.252 --> 10:20.127
Once I hit this button,
there's no going back.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.885
I am Groot.

10:37.411 --> 10:39.160
It's gonna be beautiful.

10:41.521 --> 10:44.131
Oh. Uh, sorry, bud.

10:51.646 --> 10:54.873
Whoa, whoa. Okay. All right.
Everyone back up slowly.

10:56.319 --> 11:00.095
Slowly. Okay, faster!
Let's go faster!

11:15.860 --> 11:17.159
We're trapped.

11:17.274 --> 11:19.727
Then we will make our stand
here and now.

11:19.797 --> 11:22.610
Wait! Hold your fire!
Slashing, whatever.

11:22.688 --> 11:24.078
I knew I saw something before.

11:24.114 --> 11:27.693
These are the plant guys that saved me.
I'm sure of it.

11:27.927 --> 11:30.888
I am Star-Lord.
I mean you no harm.

11:31.269 --> 11:33.236
Ten to one it eats him.

11:38.668 --> 11:40.801
See? It's all good.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.597
Huh?

11:43.504 --> 11:44.879
Aah!

11:45.593 --> 11:47.505
Quill!
I am Groot!

11:47.545 --> 11:48.762
Called it.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.783
Kind of wished you hadn't...

12:03.522 --> 12:04.754
Everyone stand down.

12:04.871 --> 12:07.232
That's still Quill inside that Symbiote.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.813
Yeah, well, the other
Symbiotes don't seem to give a flarg.

12:19.453 --> 12:22.492
I... guess we
should pick a side?

12:22.571 --> 12:25.556
I have picked.

12:34.573 --> 12:36.214
Uh... thanks.

12:36.378 --> 12:38.799
Work, you krutackin'
piece of flarg!

12:38.907 --> 12:41.682
No sonics! You
will disintegrate our friends.

12:41.948 --> 12:44.151
Killjoy.

12:44.236 --> 12:46.464
I'm starting to think you
really are Quill in there.

12:46.549 --> 12:50.354
We need you to seal off the
tunnel from the bad Symbiotes.

12:52.143 --> 12:54.385
Oh, yeah.

12:57.891 --> 13:01.862
Release me!
I am winning!

13:05.190 --> 13:07.098
I'll show ya winning.

13:12.662 --> 13:15.169
Yes!
Well, that's great,

13:15.279 --> 13:18.310
as long as we don't
need to use the elevator.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.025
Do not worry.

13:20.169 --> 13:21.512
We have a plan.

13:21.622 --> 13:23.583
Definitely Quill.

13:23.716 --> 13:25.450
We are called the Klyntar.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.730
We have been tracking your
movements, trying to help.

13:27.754 --> 13:30.789
But the only way
we could communicate directly

13:30.829 --> 13:33.102
was to bond with the one
you call Quill.

13:33.258 --> 13:35.532
Hmph! How's that
working out for ya?

13:35.680 --> 13:38.930
It is weird. But you have nothing
to fear from the Klyntar.

13:39.039 --> 13:40.860
We are a peaceful race.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.422
<i>We lived in symbiosis with all the
different species of our home world,</i>

13:44.579 --> 13:49.110
<i>until the one called Thanos took
us and vaporized our planet.</i>

13:54.852 --> 13:58.235
<i>He processed the Klyntar to
remove the Klyntar's free will.</i>

13:58.961 --> 14:00.954
<i>But it corrupted the Klyntar.</i>

14:01.102 --> 14:03.688
<i>Turned the Klyntar feral
and full of rage.</i>

14:06.704 --> 14:09.774
The Klyntar you see before you
managed to avoid this fate.

14:09.907 --> 14:12.938
We have survived against
the ferals for all these years.

14:13.063 --> 14:16.391
But without hosts,
we cannot escape this world.

14:16.531 --> 14:18.777
Yeah, speaking of escape,
we got about 14 minutes

14:18.805 --> 14:21.493
before this whole planet
goes kablooey!

14:21.664 --> 14:23.977
The Klyntar can lead you
to the <i> Milano,</i>

14:24.134 --> 14:26.391
and we can all leave
the planet together.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.579
But we will require
your complete cooperation.

14:29.725 --> 14:31.519
Hold on. If you're talking about

14:31.644 --> 14:34.420
- bonding with these Klyntar...
- Agreed.

14:34.566 --> 14:38.535
Wa-Wait! Are you out of
your shiny, green head?

14:52.658 --> 14:54.650
Ha! We will enjoy this.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.235
Bonding will make us all

14:56.259 --> 14:58.541
strong enough to
fight our way to the surface.

14:58.650 --> 15:02.377
It is, in the words of our host,
"pretty flargin' awesome."

15:02.525 --> 15:05.861
You honor-swear that you will
release us once we're off-world?

15:17.291 --> 15:19.744
This will suffice.

15:21.883 --> 15:25.259
Uh, thing is,
I already bonded once today,

15:25.611 --> 15:27.001
and I'm trying to cut back.

15:27.103 --> 15:29.494
Maybe...
Maybe just the tail?

15:33.805 --> 15:35.371
Fine.

15:35.584 --> 15:38.118
Get it over with.

15:48.307 --> 15:51.573
We like this much more
than that other Symbiote.

15:52.223 --> 15:55.391
I am Groot.

15:55.563 --> 15:59.398
Groot, you must trust
the Klyn... I am Groot!

16:00.664 --> 16:03.446
We understand, and we
will respect your wishes.

16:03.516 --> 16:05.545
We do understand.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.241
We can hear
each other's thoughts.

16:07.304 --> 16:10.881
We know, and your
thoughts are disgusting.

16:10.991 --> 16:15.210
But since we share thoughts, we all
know how little time we have left.

16:29.754 --> 16:31.133
Stay behind us, Groot.

16:31.231 --> 16:33.442
You're the one they are after.

16:45.106 --> 16:47.076
It is a long way to the top.

16:47.317 --> 16:49.223
Good thing we can fly.

17:11.386 --> 17:12.775
Clear!

17:18.064 --> 17:20.209
We never knew you were so heavy.

17:32.690 --> 17:33.755
No!

17:33.786 --> 17:36.086
I am Groot.

17:36.111 --> 17:39.679
We fear this Klyntar's injuries are fatal.

17:40.030 --> 17:43.605
Or, as our host would say,
"It's bad, bud.

17:43.761 --> 17:47.700
- Real bad."
- I am Groot?

17:48.657 --> 17:52.539
There is only one thing that can
be done to save this Klyntar.

18:11.295 --> 18:15.297
We are Groot!

18:42.133 --> 18:43.445
Time is almost up!

18:43.547 --> 18:45.969
We must get to the ship!

19:09.676 --> 19:12.643
Get aboard the ship, Groot.
We will be right behind you.

19:51.803 --> 19:54.671
I am Groot.

20:02.187 --> 20:04.773
Quill, haven't you two
had enough of each other?

20:04.944 --> 20:08.687
Someone must remain bonded
so the Klyntar can communicate.

20:11.812 --> 20:15.366
How's the soil, bud? Good
enough to plant your World Pod?

20:15.624 --> 20:16.985
I am Groot.

20:17.655 --> 20:20.632
So there ain't no sacred pool here.
What difference does that make?

20:20.851 --> 20:22.437
I am Groot.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.679
Yeah, a billion millennia
is a pretty long time

20:25.757 --> 20:27.999
to grow back
an entire civilization.

20:28.148 --> 20:30.374
Then the Klyntar pledge
to share this world

20:30.460 --> 20:32.804
as the guardians
and protectors of the Groots,

20:32.898 --> 20:38.023
until both our civilizations can be
restored to their former awesomeness.

20:51.273 --> 20:54.356
That's weird. I didn't think
this system had any comets.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.859
That is no comet.

20:56.999 --> 20:59.648
The Klyntar can sense it is
a fragment of Groot's planet,

20:59.772 --> 21:04.024
infested with feral Symbiotes and
headed for inhabited systems.

21:04.202 --> 21:08.203
Yeah, we should probably
do something about that.

21:13.570 --> 21:15.388
Later, bro.
Congratulations, Quill.

21:15.499 --> 21:19.320
You're the only human
to ever infect a Symbiote.

21:23.815 --> 21:26.701
Guardians,
let's catch that rock.

21:28.141 --> 21:31.438
I am Groot.
