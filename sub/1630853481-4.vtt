WEBVTT

00:18.285 --> 00:19.725
In Ohio...

00:31.632 --> 00:34.302
It just feels like this is
gonna go bad quickly.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.114
Then, in Georgia...

00:39.840 --> 00:41.270
Routine patrol...

00:41.308 --> 00:43.208
It went from 0 to 100.

00:43.243 --> 00:44.983
...turns deadly.

00:52.252 --> 00:55.392
My main focus was just
hopefully stay alive.

00:55.422 --> 00:58.262
And the suspect
is on the loose.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.697
Yeah, drop it,
come outside!

01:17.144 --> 01:18.314
In Ohio,

01:18.345 --> 01:21.455
15 miles north of Cincinnati,

01:21.481 --> 01:24.721
is the city of Springdale.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.658
Springdale
has a lot of retail.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.291
We don’t have a very large
residential population

01:33.327 --> 01:34.657
compared to a larger city,

01:34.695 --> 01:37.405
but the retail brings
people in from outside.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.228
When you hear a person
with a knife, you just
never know.

02:44.264 --> 02:46.334
It could be
a hostage situation.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.366
We’ve always got to be
prepared for the worst.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.067
I was
already out on patrol.

02:54.107 --> 02:58.107
I could hear different
officers come up
on the radio saying,

02:58.145 --> 02:59.655
"I’m here. I’m responding."

02:59.680 --> 03:03.820
That allows me as
the commander to know
who is going to be there.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.490
It helps me to focus on
what we need to do
when we get there.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.660
The store worker
comes out, she goes,

03:15.696 --> 03:18.156
"We got everyone out.
The store is evacuated."

03:18.198 --> 03:19.668
So that was phenomenal.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.370
It was time to go in
and see what we had
on our hands.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.626
Call 8 Paul 81
on premises, making entry.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.668
We go
in as four officers,

03:56.703 --> 03:59.143
and we start making our
way through the store.

04:00.006 --> 04:02.506
We had officers
with handguns out.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.882
We also had an officer
with a taser out.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.693
It was
very eerie.

04:15.722 --> 04:18.022
It was quiet.
Nobody was there.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.128
It felt wrong.

04:19.159 --> 04:22.259
Why isn’t this place
filled with customers?

04:22.295 --> 04:25.195
Why don’t you hear
messages on an intercom?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.840
You’re walking through
this eerie silence

04:29.870 --> 04:31.070
just waiting

04:32.072 --> 04:33.572
to see what is gonna be there.

04:35.342 --> 04:38.812
It’s like you’re waiting
in a scary movie
to get that scare.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.367
We didn’t know where
the suspect was.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.926
We knew where he last seen.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.366
He can move anywhere
in a store,

05:04.404 --> 05:06.614
and it’s a very large store.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.710
We’ve got to go
there tactically.

05:13.380 --> 05:17.020
Every single aisle
is a hard corner,
as we call it.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.320
That’s an area where
a person could hide.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.734
We don’t know
the intentions
of the suspect.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.060
We don’t know if he’s
here to hurt one of us.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.498
We don’t know if he
wants us to hurt him.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.912
So as we go through there,
we have to go nice and slow.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.839
And we have to look at those
corners because we
can’t be surprised.

05:42.876 --> 05:46.646
Because surprise is not
a good situation for us
or the suspect.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.821
We hear
a noise to our left.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.665
So two of us kind of diverted
to see what that was.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.329
It was very difficult
to assess.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.461
All I have is sound
and until I can see

06:03.496 --> 06:05.796
what made that sound,
I can’t really react.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.347
I take the corner
and I see the suspect.

07:01.354 --> 07:05.534
I notice he’s looking down,
he’s got a knife in his hand.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.188
He just looked...

07:07.227 --> 07:08.587
He looked defeated.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.310
He’s not responding
to demands.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.754
He just stares,
almost blankly.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.753
Like that 1,000-yard
stare you hear about.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.933
He stands up.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.901
He grabs a little
can of propane.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.830
Now he’s got
the propane in one hand
and a knife in the other.

07:46.866 --> 07:50.196
It just feels like this is
gonna go bad quickly.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.365
It felt like he wanted
us to do something.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.491
What we call suicide by cop.

08:13.526 --> 08:17.856
That he wanted to put us
in a situation we were
forced to shoot him.

08:35.882 --> 08:41.122
Just to watch him physically
grab the wires
and yank them off,

08:41.154 --> 08:45.064
like it was nothing,
was shocking to us.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.031
When he was tased,
he dropped the cannister
that he had

08:48.061 --> 08:49.401
but he did not drop the knife.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.927
He grabs
the gas can again.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.439
We can take
two shots with our taser.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.141
So again Officer
Grindle hits him.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.477
But again, he’s shaking it
off like it was nothing.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.318
I thought, "We’re gonna
have to shoot him."

09:14.354 --> 09:17.864
We are gonna have
to shoot him if he
takes one more step.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.332
We don’t want to hurt anybody.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.873
Our job as police officers
is to save lives.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.399
We wanna help
in this situation.

09:28.435 --> 09:31.375
Unfortunately, he was
making it difficult
to do that.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.576
If this guy were
to just lunge at the officers
they would have to shoot him.

09:40.613 --> 09:46.123
I had to think about some
command decisions
regarding what’s next.

09:46.152 --> 09:51.322
The officers have tried
to use their less-lethal,
their taser, with no effect.

09:51.357 --> 09:55.127
In a situation like where, uh,
a deadly weapon is involved

09:55.161 --> 09:58.301
we might have
to engage deadly force.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.231
SWAT was dispatched.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.953
In the academy, they
teach you 21 steps.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.023
If somebody has a knife out,

10:19.052 --> 10:21.122
and your gun is holstered,

10:21.154 --> 10:23.694
it’s impossible for you
to get out and fire a shot

10:23.723 --> 10:26.593
if someone is within
21 steps of you.

10:26.626 --> 10:31.796
We did have our guns out,
so we had a little space
that we could give up.

10:31.831 --> 10:36.341
People don’t realize
that our vest will not
stop a knife.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.539
If someone has a knife
and they stab me,
it’s going through.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.910
How much leeway
are we gonna give him
to try and talk to him

10:47.947 --> 10:49.977
and give him a chance
to drop that knife,

10:50.016 --> 10:52.146
before he forces our hand?

11:14.941 --> 11:17.811
We could kinda guess he maybe
had a mental health issue,

11:17.844 --> 11:20.084
but we didn’t know
that for 100%.

11:22.882 --> 11:27.192
A lot of our calls might
not be categorized
as a mental health call,

11:27.220 --> 11:29.820
but once you get there,
you find out that it is.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.231
I have a bachelor’s degree
in psychology.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.200
But I also teach
crisis intervention
for our county.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.000
I have no idea what
I can do to help,
but I gotta be there

11:40.033 --> 11:43.943
because I know these
guys, I know the fear
in their voice.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.270
I immediately run
into the building.

11:46.306 --> 11:51.676
But yet, there’s dead silence
in store, other than just
Erik Langevin talking.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.286
Langevin is
doing a fantastic job.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.731
But from my point of view
and my experience,

12:06.759 --> 12:10.599
I was worried about Erik
because it is just
so mentally exhausting

12:10.630 --> 12:14.500
to stay with somebody
with the adrenaline
pumping and anxiety,

12:14.534 --> 12:16.444
and there’s just
a lot going on.

12:27.013 --> 12:30.953
I didn’t introduce myself
as officer, detective,
it’s Erik.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.894
’Cause I wanna be
on a personal level.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.598
It’s very important when
you deal with anybody

12:43.630 --> 12:46.730
to establish a good
rapport, especially
in a crisis situation.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.596
You want that person
to be able to trust you.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.925
You don’t have to have
a perfect script of what
you’re gonna say,

13:12.959 --> 13:15.429
he just talked,
he just let him
know he cared.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.601
We’re here to help you,
let us help you.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.081
When I got his name,

13:37.116 --> 13:40.016
I felt like I had a giant
smile on my face.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.223
I know I didn’t.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.124
But inside I was cheering.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.686
Because I thought, "Okay.
We can do this."

13:50.797 --> 13:52.797
Now he’s not just any
person, he’s Landen.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.774
He knows my name,
I know his name.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.743
I wanna connect
on that personal level.

13:58.771 --> 14:02.811
I want to remind him
that he’s a person
that’s worth saving

14:02.842 --> 14:06.012
before our SWAT come
on the scene and take over.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.758
He just continued
to keep talking to him.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.473
Erik had been
talking to him
for almost half an hour.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.070
We did talk, should we
switch somebody out?

15:03.102 --> 15:04.802
Just to give him
a mental break.

15:04.837 --> 15:08.237
But we made the choice
just to keep him going.

15:08.274 --> 15:12.014
It’s really physically
draining to be in this
situation for that long.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.254
But I’ve got to keep
him focused on me.

15:20.620 --> 15:24.690
I just literally kept waiting
for him to just either cut
his neck, cut his wrists,

15:24.724 --> 15:28.264
or something because he would
just not let go of this knife.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.396
There was points
in the situation

15:35.435 --> 15:37.975
where the knife would
become looser in his hand.

15:38.004 --> 15:41.374
But then he would
motivate himself
by taking the taser barb

15:41.407 --> 15:43.937
and rubbing his chest,
and he would tighten
his grip again.

15:43.976 --> 15:47.106
It’s like pumping yourself
up to do something.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.746
Like an MMA fighter or a boxer

15:49.782 --> 15:52.792
pumping themselves
up before a fight.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.519
To me, Landen was doing this.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.795
He was preparing
himself for a fight.

16:01.194 --> 16:05.464
He was mentally preparing
himself to come forward
and force our hand.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.928
I just have to slow
the situation down.

16:08.968 --> 16:14.038
And get Landen back
focused on me,
not on the pain.

16:14.073 --> 16:17.643
And I knew it wasn’t just
gonna be a dropping
of the knife.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.077
It was gonna have
to be baby steps.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.888
We’ve already asked him
to drop the knife,
he’s not gonna do it.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.997
So now my focus
was the gas can.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.900
If I can get him
to drop the gas can,

16:39.932 --> 16:42.742
then I know I have
him mentally going
in the right direction.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.647
When he drops that
gas can that’s huge for me.

17:30.683 --> 17:34.123
We’re getting one more step
closer to a peaceful
resolution.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.293
It tells me we’re
on the right path.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.862
He’s dropped the can.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.690
He’s not charging towards us.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.985
We’re gonna get him
to drop the knife.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.736
I felt like he was there.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.644
He was mentally ready
to drop the knife,

17:57.677 --> 18:00.447
he just wasn’t letting
himself do it.

18:15.528 --> 18:19.568
When SWAT walks in,
to me that changed everything.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.299
We had this situation calm.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.845
But you bring SWAT in
and you’re thinking,

18:24.870 --> 18:25.970
"Okay, is this gonna help?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.010
"Or is this gonna hurt?"

18:49.028 --> 18:52.128
SWAT was gonna come in
and take over the scene

18:52.164 --> 18:54.834
and deal with the subject
’cause that’s what SWAT does.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.905
I didn’t want
that to happen yet.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.907
Erik’s rapport
was getting better.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.015
My worry is that Landen
sees them as a threat.

19:09.048 --> 19:12.988
So now this might push
him forward

19:13.019 --> 19:16.419
and to charge and have
a knife and now we’re
forced to do something.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.861
Once he was in custody,

21:33.893 --> 21:37.163
my job’s done.
The SWAT team can take over.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.373
I’m still in that mindset now
where I’m still going.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.243
Was over an hour,
but in my mind,

21:47.273 --> 21:49.783
the time, it felt like it was
no time at all.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.453
I’m happy
that the knife’s dropped,

21:53.479 --> 21:56.279
but that adrenal dump happens,
and I’m just...

21:56.315 --> 21:57.445
I’ve gotta get away.

22:01.086 --> 22:02.446
I didn’t wanna be
near anybody.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.258
I just needed
a moment to myself.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.758
Kind of dropped my knee,

22:07.793 --> 22:10.663
and just kind of said
a quick prayer.

22:14.233 --> 22:17.443
Just needed time away
just to just relax.

22:25.978 --> 22:30.048
Landen is charged
with one count
of inducing panic

22:30.082 --> 22:32.752
and two counts
of aggravated menace.

22:34.386 --> 22:37.716
The court finds him
incompetent to stand trial

22:37.756 --> 22:40.756
and orders
he receive treatment.

22:40.793 --> 22:45.333
We really didn’t
want to punish Landen,
like he was a criminal.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.034
We knew Landen needed help.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.866
We did that situation right.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.341
We handled that right.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.409
And for Landen, he’s alive,

22:53.439 --> 22:54.839
and he’s doing okay.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.914
And his family who adores him,
they still have him.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.283
And we were able to get him
the help he needed.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.382
Just almost there.
There you go, bud.

23:02.414 --> 23:04.224
There you go.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.420
The Los Angeles
County Sheriff’s Department
is now using the body cam

23:06.452 --> 23:09.762
in their police academies
to teach de-escalation.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.218
So it’s neat to think
something we did,

23:12.258 --> 23:16.928
in our little town,
is being shown
across the country

23:16.962 --> 23:19.772
for tips on how to handle
a situation like that.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.073
We’re there
to help people...

23:23.068 --> 23:24.268
...make a difference...

23:25.204 --> 23:27.144
...serve the community.

23:27.172 --> 23:29.882
And I think that day
we did a great job.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.754
In Georgia,

23:33.779 --> 23:37.019
17 miles south of Atlanta

23:37.049 --> 23:38.949
is the city of Fairburn.

23:42.955 --> 23:46.395
It’s the 2019
Super Bowl weekend,

23:46.425 --> 23:50.295
and the game is being held
in the nearby state capital.

23:52.197 --> 23:55.427
Fairburn PD’s
Corporal Krystal Wilborn

23:55.467 --> 24:00.037
has signed up
for an extra shift to help
with the influx of visitors.

24:02.308 --> 24:05.738
When you have, uh, big events
like the Super Bowl,

24:05.778 --> 24:09.778
it effects not only Atlanta,
but it effects
the surrounding cities

24:09.815 --> 24:13.615
because people travel
all around to come attend
these events.

24:13.652 --> 24:15.792
But the criminals
are also getting prepared,

24:15.821 --> 24:18.291
literally getting prepared
for the crowd that comes.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.862
We started at00 p. m.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.828
And our goal was the hotels.

24:28.867 --> 24:31.997
Our job was just
to patrol, patrol, patrol,

24:32.037 --> 24:34.037
and, uh, look
for anything suspicious

24:34.073 --> 24:36.743
to make sure
that no one is breaking
into these people’s cars.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.924
The hotels are packed.

24:43.949 --> 24:48.089
And as I’m driving,
I see a burgundy F-250.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.960
And I see condensation
that’s coming out of the pipe,

24:50.990 --> 24:54.860
so I knew that the vehicle
was turned on.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.433
I just wanted to see
what was going on

24:56.462 --> 24:58.662
and to make contact
with the vehicle.

24:58.697 --> 25:02.997
I park forward,
and I approached the vehicle.

25:03.035 --> 25:07.145
As I approached,
I smell a strong smell
of marijuana.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.912
And I seen that there
was one male occupying
the vehicle,

25:09.942 --> 25:11.142
and he was asleep.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.276
I realized
it was a temporary tag
out of Tennessee.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.600
I called
Officer Sims for backup.

25:36.635 --> 25:38.865
I did not wanna disturb
the gentleman,

25:38.904 --> 25:41.144
especially with the smell
of marijuana.

25:41.173 --> 25:44.213
I figured that he had
a large amount due
to the strong smell,

25:44.243 --> 25:46.413
and I am a female.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.585
That is a male inside
of the vehicle.

25:48.614 --> 25:50.384
So no matter how strong I am,

25:50.416 --> 25:51.346
anything could happen.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.061
Well, nothing came up,

26:00.092 --> 26:02.062
but I wasn’t too surprised.

26:02.094 --> 26:04.334
It could’ve been
just a system error.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.333
Um, it could’ve been
a brand new vehicle.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.600
The most that I was expecting
maybe to detain

26:12.638 --> 26:15.568
find out who this person is,
where he’s supposed to go,

26:15.607 --> 26:18.237
and that’s what I was hoping.

26:18.277 --> 26:21.747
But you just never know
how things are gonna turn out.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.049
New recruit
Officer Levar Sims...

26:28.287 --> 26:29.917
...arrives on scene.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.087
I was training Officer Sims
at the time.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.696
He had transitioned
from being a firefighter.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.958
He was a good recruit.

26:38.997 --> 26:41.967
He literally did not cause me
any problems.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.770
Uh, he’s very coachable.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.602
Um, he’s teachable.

26:45.637 --> 26:46.967
Um, and he was smart.

26:47.005 --> 26:51.175
And that particular day
was his first day out
on his own.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.480
And he was doing well.

27:10.262 --> 27:13.032
Officer Sims flashed
his flashlight

27:13.065 --> 27:14.505
inside of the vehicle,

27:14.533 --> 27:16.333
and that woke
the gentleman up immediately.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.946
He was shocked
because he’s just waking up,

27:33.986 --> 27:35.416
and now, you’ve got two cops.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.224
We were both
kind of talking to him.

27:37.256 --> 27:41.256
We was asking him, you know,
"Hey, how are you?
We’re just checking on you."

27:41.293 --> 27:44.403
Um, not letting him know
that we smelled
the smell of marijuana

27:44.429 --> 27:45.899
so maybe
he wouldn’t freak out.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.583
If you don’t have
a reason to be here,

27:59.611 --> 28:00.881
then you’re loitering

28:00.913 --> 28:02.113
’cause you can’t
just sleep here.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.917
So I was just trying
to identify him, who he was

28:04.950 --> 28:07.150
and what was his reason
for being at the hotel.

28:10.255 --> 28:11.885
-Okay.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.386
When someone’s
not answering questions
like that,

28:16.428 --> 28:20.728
it do raise a sense
of something’s not right.

28:20.766 --> 28:25.566
He began to reach
from the front to the back
from the front to the back.

28:25.604 --> 28:27.014
He got drugs in the car.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.739
Where there’s drugs
most of the time there’s guns.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.125
He’s definitely
acting suspicious.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.661
He could’ve had
a legitimate reason
to reach back there,

28:51.697 --> 28:55.267
but only he knows
where everything is situated
in the vehicle.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.530
The fact
that I couldn’t see...

28:56.568 --> 28:58.368
He couldn’t answer
any questions.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.813
So I just didn’t want him
reaching back there at all

29:00.839 --> 29:03.309
’cause I don’t know
what’s the next thing
he’s gonna pull out.

29:14.152 --> 29:15.892
The gentleman jumped
out of the truck,

29:15.921 --> 29:18.361
so I kind of stepped back
to give the guy some room

29:18.390 --> 29:20.260
and then that way
I can see his hands.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.692
I knew then that something’s
about to go down.

29:25.163 --> 29:26.363
Once he stepped out,

29:26.398 --> 29:28.868
Officer Sims went
around the front
of the vehicle

29:28.900 --> 29:29.930
to try to make it to me.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.425
It went from 0 to 100.

29:45.450 --> 29:49.090
Very quickly he opened
that back door in my face,

29:49.121 --> 29:52.861
jumped back
into the driver’s seat,
and put it in reverse.

29:52.891 --> 29:55.391
I jump
in the rear driver’s side,

29:55.427 --> 29:58.627
and I got him in a head lock
trying to embolize him.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.834
Sims actually got
into the passenger side.

30:09.875 --> 30:14.185
I was just more afraid
for Sims ’cause he swings
that truck so hard.

30:14.212 --> 30:17.252
I see the passenger door
just fold

30:17.282 --> 30:19.222
until 180 degree.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.851
So I’m thinking
either Sims got
thrown out originally,

30:21.887 --> 30:22.887
or he was crushed.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.894
But I looked directly
into the driver’s side window,

30:28.927 --> 30:30.497
and Sims still was giving
a fight.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.771
That vehicle is now
a lethal weapon.

30:37.803 --> 30:40.613
And I would be very justified
for shooting.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.269
But at the time,
I was carrying a .45,

30:43.308 --> 30:44.578
and those bullets are huge.

30:44.609 --> 30:46.539
It wouldn’t went
through the metal
of that truck,

30:46.578 --> 30:48.208
probably went
through his body,

30:48.246 --> 30:50.676
and maybe could’ve hit Sims,
and I didn’t wanna do that.

31:02.294 --> 31:05.804
When he hit that speed bump,
it kind of threw Sims
off balance,

31:05.831 --> 31:07.401
and he fell out.

31:07.432 --> 31:11.202
And when he fell out,
he still was in line
of that rear tire of F-250,

31:11.236 --> 31:12.836
and it ran over his abdomen.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.787
I immediately call for backup,

31:36.828 --> 31:38.558
and then
I literally asked Sims,

31:38.597 --> 31:40.367
"What do you want me to do?"

31:40.399 --> 31:42.769
Because I didn’t wanna
go chase after the vehicle

31:42.801 --> 31:45.201
and leave him there
’cause nobody else was around.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.907
That feeling
of just been helpless is just,

31:47.939 --> 31:49.569
it’s really
a horrible feeling.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.446
The call comes
out over the radio,

31:56.481 --> 31:59.581
and it was time to go.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.559
When I heard it was Sims,
I was like...

32:09.594 --> 32:10.904
My heart just sank

32:10.929 --> 32:13.899
because I knew
that this was his first night
out on his own.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.578
The suspect left
on the Highway 74

32:29.614 --> 32:31.384
and was heading eastbound.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.176
Where he was at,
there was only a few streets

32:33.218 --> 32:34.518
that he could’ve
turned off from.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.523
So we had officers checking
every off street.

33:01.947 --> 33:04.247
He was just
in a whole lot of pain,

33:04.282 --> 33:05.282
a whole lot of pain.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.322
I didn’t see
any blood,

33:08.353 --> 33:10.623
but he possibly could be
internally bleeding

33:10.655 --> 33:12.385
’cause crush ribs could’ve
puncture lungs.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.464
He could drown
in his own blood.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.063
Everything is going
through my head.

33:16.094 --> 33:19.034
But my main focus was just him
and just keeping him conscious

33:19.064 --> 33:21.534
and hopefully he stays alive.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.770
From the traffic
that was coming
over the radio,

33:27.806 --> 33:31.276
I understood
that he’d been run over
by a vehicle.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.339
I know that’s serious injury.

33:33.378 --> 33:37.248
So in the back of my mind,
I have a lot of concern
for him.

33:37.282 --> 33:39.552
The only thing really going
through my mind was

33:39.584 --> 33:42.794
"Is Sims okay?"
and "Where am I gonna
find this guy?"

33:42.821 --> 33:46.961
You just click
into your training mode,
your police mode,

33:46.992 --> 33:49.232
and you just do
what’s gotta be done.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.567
Another officer
who was on shift

34:00.605 --> 34:02.435
located a vehicle matching
the description,

34:02.474 --> 34:07.554
so we immediately responded
to the area where he was at
to help him.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.321
My heartrate tripled.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.349
It was...
The amount of adrenaline...

34:13.385 --> 34:15.525
It was unreal, the feeling.

34:51.456 --> 34:54.256
But upon us arriving
to where the truck was,

34:54.292 --> 34:58.602
we determined
that it was not the suspect,
was not the right vehicle,

34:58.630 --> 35:00.130
similar but not the right one.

35:00.165 --> 35:03.175
And the driver
was a Caucasian male

35:03.201 --> 35:04.341
which didn’t match
the description.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.650
Just ’cause found
the wrong truck doesn’t mean
we gotta stop looking.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.430
It’s a lot of pressure
because you’re on
a time crunch at this point.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.763
There’s a good possibility
that he’s already gone.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.428
But you have a sense of duty
to bring justice

35:36.468 --> 35:38.998
to this officer
who’s severally injured.

35:41.773 --> 35:45.183
Paramedics
are now on scene
at the Holiday Inn.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.022
Once EMT
and the damlissic get there,

35:57.055 --> 35:58.625
I have already removed
his vest.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.257
They ended up cutting
his pants.

36:00.291 --> 36:03.591
And they put him on the board,
and put him on the bed,
and they loaded him up.

36:06.898 --> 36:10.668
After Sims left and went
to the hospital,
it kind of gave me a relief.

36:10.702 --> 36:13.772
But I still was kind of
on edge only because...

36:14.739 --> 36:16.069
...he was alive
when he left me.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.007
I don’t know
if he’s gonna survive
the injuries.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.480
On the streets
of Fairburn...

36:27.686 --> 36:29.916
...officers continue
the search.

36:34.592 --> 36:37.332
You can get
a long way at night

36:37.362 --> 36:39.802
driving in 20 minutes.

36:39.831 --> 36:43.701
So I knew there was a chance
that he’s gone now.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.945
But the truck had
a Tennessee temporary tag
on it.

36:46.971 --> 36:50.841
That gave some hope
that he has no clue
where he’s at.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.205
He’s probably gonna hide
and try to call somebody.

36:53.244 --> 36:56.314
If we’re gonna find him,
it’s not because we got
there fast

36:56.347 --> 36:58.147
because the time
had already elapsed.

36:58.183 --> 37:02.223
So we kind of slowed it
a little bit just to do
a more thorough search.

37:20.772 --> 37:25.112
My first instinct
was I’ve gotta get up
to where he’s at.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.608
He saw me almost immediately

37:28.646 --> 37:29.946
and takes off down the road,

37:29.981 --> 37:34.321
so I take off after him
as quick as I possibly can.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.293
He made a left in a yard

37:38.323 --> 37:39.893
and drove through the woods.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.853
We start scouring, looking.
Where could it’ve gone?

38:07.886 --> 38:10.656
And that’s when we realized
that there’s a trail
that lead into the woods.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.160
Running
through those woods,

38:20.198 --> 38:23.868
everything runs
through your mind
anything that could happen.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.502
Is that dude’s gonna
come from my left,
come from my right?

38:26.538 --> 38:30.778
He abandoned the truck,
and he’s standing in the woods
waiting to shoot us.

38:30.809 --> 38:34.509
The guy, he’s already done
some pretty heinous acts.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.176
You gotta be prepared
for anything.

38:59.270 --> 39:00.910
It was muddy.

39:00.939 --> 39:04.739
And I began to see trails
of tire tracks leading away
from the wood line.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.236
The truck had made it through.

39:06.277 --> 39:09.747
And, um, emptied out
onto the main highway.

39:19.057 --> 39:22.987
It’s a plethora of roads
that he could’ve chosen
to go down.

39:23.027 --> 39:27.367
The more hands on deck,
it really helps.

39:27.398 --> 39:30.368
We passed the information
onto our surrounding agencies

39:30.401 --> 39:32.601
to help try to locate
this guy.

39:37.542 --> 39:42.552
20 minutes later,
officers from neighboring
Tyrone PD

39:42.580 --> 39:44.950
get a lead
on the suspect’s truck.

40:14.445 --> 40:15.705
When we received
the information

40:15.747 --> 40:18.817
that Tyrone police
had located the vehicle,

40:18.850 --> 40:20.790
way off the beaten path,

40:20.818 --> 40:22.248
we were real excited

40:22.287 --> 40:25.217
because no longer
are we having
to chase down a vehicle.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.256
This guy’s on foot.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.362
If we establish a perimeter
around this guy,

40:29.394 --> 40:31.234
and we get him cornered in,

40:31.262 --> 40:33.132
there’s a good possibility
we’re gonna catch him.

40:43.007 --> 40:44.837
The dogs,
they’ve got a good hit.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.376
So we just start following
the dogs.

40:48.579 --> 40:53.049
We went down roads,
behind houses, through sheds,

40:53.084 --> 40:55.924
and eventually took off
where the trail ended.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.018
It was very frustrating.

40:59.057 --> 41:02.127
We knew that there was
only one way he could’ve gone
out of there.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.990
It was probably by vehicle.

41:04.028 --> 41:05.758
He probably
up and left the state.

41:09.767 --> 41:11.637
The search isn’t over.

41:12.937 --> 41:15.637
Investigators identify
the suspect

41:15.673 --> 41:19.283
as 33 year old Taurean McShan.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.750
He is wanted
for drug-related charges

41:21.779 --> 41:23.949
in his home state
of Tennessee.

41:26.284 --> 41:32.294
Three days later, US Marshals
locate McShan in Memphis
and arrest him.

41:33.925 --> 41:36.795
He is currently awaiting trial
on charges

41:36.828 --> 41:41.468
including hit and run,
aggravated assault,
and reckless driving.

41:44.535 --> 41:47.035
After undergoing
emergency surgery

41:47.071 --> 41:50.411
for a fractured spine
and lacerated liver,

41:50.441 --> 41:52.281
Officer Sims recovers.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.554
He retires from policing.

41:57.448 --> 42:01.018
I knew it was
only a matter of time
before he was caught.

42:01.052 --> 42:05.222
Then when we get word
that he had been apprehended
and was taken into custody,

42:05.256 --> 42:08.356
man, that was like
a weight lifted
off your shoulders.

42:09.560 --> 42:13.660
I visit
Officer Sims frequently.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.828
I didn’t miss
too many days that he was up
in the hospital.

42:17.568 --> 42:19.598
I think he’s very lucky
to be alive.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.135
It’s definitely
a learning experience

42:23.174 --> 42:26.244
where if it happens
or a similar situation
happened again,

42:26.277 --> 42:27.847
um, what would you do?

42:29.347 --> 42:33.547
It’s amazing
that he lived through it.

42:33.584 --> 42:37.524
He had really the capabilities
to be a great police officer.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.955
He was a blast to work with.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.860
And we miss him up here.
