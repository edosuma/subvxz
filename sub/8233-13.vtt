00:01.733 --> 00:03.533
Previously on
Witches of East End...

00:03.566 --> 00:05.800
Every life you come across
Killian, and you fall in love.

00:05.833 --> 00:07.800
What did you drink?

00:07.833 --> 00:09.475
Poison, so I can be with Freya.

00:09.508 --> 00:12.342
East End is turning out
to be a very strange place.

00:12.375 --> 00:14.542
We need a dark spell
to stop a dark warlock.

00:17.496 --> 00:19.262
TARKOFF:
I love you.

00:19.296 --> 00:21.296
And before long...

00:21.329 --> 00:23.462
you're gonna love me, too.

00:23.496 --> 00:25.796
Did you enjoy your visit
with Dash?

00:25.829 --> 00:28.062
Let's discuss your punishment.

00:34.562 --> 00:35.696
(teakettle whistling)

00:35.729 --> 00:37.362
(whistling stops)

00:37.396 --> 00:38.862
You moved me.

00:41.296 --> 00:42.529
I had to.

00:42.562 --> 00:45.296
I needed a bit more room.

00:45.329 --> 00:47.796
But I want you
to know‐‐

00:47.829 --> 00:50.829
I do not take pleasure
in your suffering.

00:53.396 --> 00:56.129
I've had to do the same
with Frederick over the years.

00:56.162 --> 00:59.029
It's the only way
you'll learn not to defy me.

00:59.062 --> 01:00.862
Come.

01:00.896 --> 01:03.462
Sit. Have some tea.

01:04.962 --> 01:06.696
That's my girl.

01:06.729 --> 01:08.862
I know you're too smart
to try to escape

01:08.896 --> 01:10.729
while I'm standing right here.

01:16.796 --> 01:18.962
You must be hoarse.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.696
You were screaming a lot.

01:20.729 --> 01:22.329
You were torturing me.

01:22.362 --> 01:26.296
I prefer to think
of it as... discipline.

01:32.196 --> 01:33.929
Here.

01:33.962 --> 01:35.796
It's goldenseal and lemon.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.862
It'll heal your throat.

01:40.529 --> 01:42.696
(sighs)
Very well.

01:45.029 --> 01:47.462
Believe it or not,
I took it easy on you...

01:47.496 --> 01:48.929
because of your condition.

01:48.962 --> 01:52.296
My condition?

01:52.329 --> 01:53.929
How are you feeling?

01:53.962 --> 01:55.096
Nauseous? Tired?

01:55.129 --> 01:57.962
I'm fine.

01:57.996 --> 02:00.329
You don't know, do you?

02:03.362 --> 02:05.862
I knew the minute
I laid eyes on you.

02:07.696 --> 02:09.296
You knew what?

02:09.329 --> 02:11.296
You're pregnant, my child.

02:14.996 --> 02:17.962
You're having a baby.

02:31.329 --> 02:32.662
Come on, Joanna.

02:32.696 --> 02:34.096
Where the hell are you?

02:34.129 --> 02:35.462
Where did
the door go?

02:35.496 --> 02:36.462
It disappeared. We're too late.

02:36.496 --> 02:37.762
So now we're stuck here?

02:37.796 --> 02:39.329
On the upside,
it won't be for long.

02:39.362 --> 02:41.096
We're gonna die
if we don't get out of here.

02:41.129 --> 02:42.429
The only way out
just disappeared.

02:42.462 --> 02:43.929
And you're making jokes?!

02:43.962 --> 02:45.962
I'm sorry, I can't help it.
It's a nervous tick.

02:45.996 --> 02:47.929
Where the hell
did Mom go?

02:47.962 --> 02:50.096
She probably got caught up
kicking Tarkoff's ass.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.429
She's just running
a bit late.

02:51.462 --> 02:52.429
Yeah, you think?

02:52.462 --> 02:53.429
Definitely.

02:53.462 --> 02:54.462
I'm not worried.

02:54.496 --> 02:55.762
She hasn't been gone
that long.

02:55.796 --> 02:56.762
She'll be back soon.

02:56.796 --> 02:57.662
Any minute.

02:57.696 --> 02:59.096
And if she's not?

02:59.129 --> 03:00.829
Then we'll find her,
and we'll get out of this,

03:00.862 --> 03:01.762
or die trying.

03:01.796 --> 03:02.829
That's not funny.

03:02.862 --> 03:04.496
That one wasn't a joke.

03:06.129 --> 03:08.762
Ingrid had the right
idea staying back home.

03:08.796 --> 03:10.362
She always was
the smart one.

03:10.396 --> 03:12.496
Oh, honey, I'm sure she's going
through her own hell

03:12.529 --> 03:13.762
with your grandfather right now.

03:13.796 --> 03:15.196
I wish I could text her.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.796
The 1840s blows.

03:18.996 --> 03:20.329
What did you say?

03:20.362 --> 03:22.362
The 1840s blows.

03:22.396 --> 03:24.496
Yeah, it does.

03:24.529 --> 03:25.796
And you just gave me an idea.

03:25.829 --> 03:27.862
Freya, get
off your ass.

03:27.896 --> 03:29.129
We got to move.

03:29.162 --> 03:30.896
Wait.
Come on.

03:41.029 --> 03:42.862
Stop it.

03:42.896 --> 03:45.462
Stop.

03:45.496 --> 03:48.329
(laughs) This is just like
when we were 16.

03:48.362 --> 03:52.196
Back in the stables
behind your father's castle.

03:52.229 --> 03:54.996
You pushed me away then, too.

03:55.029 --> 03:57.096
And you laughed at me.

03:57.129 --> 04:00.529
You thought my love
for you was funny.

04:00.562 --> 04:03.496
But we're together now, darling.

04:03.529 --> 04:05.196
And that's what matters.

04:05.229 --> 04:08.396
We will never be together.

04:10.696 --> 04:13.662
There is no spell that will
ever make that happen.

04:13.696 --> 04:17.629
There are many spells
that can make that happen.

04:17.662 --> 04:20.162
JOANNA: We're in my bedroom.
How did we get here?

04:20.196 --> 04:22.362
Shh.

04:23.529 --> 04:27.429
I think you need another dose.

04:27.462 --> 04:29.496
Stop.
Shh.

04:29.529 --> 04:32.629
Think of it as medicine.

04:33.829 --> 04:35.796
It'll help keep your mind calm.

04:35.829 --> 04:37.429
(groans)

04:37.462 --> 04:41.329
Bring you around
to my way of thinking.

04:55.696 --> 04:59.462
I've loved you
for over 500 years.

04:59.496 --> 05:02.329
And tonight...

05:04.496 --> 05:06.796
...I'm going
to have you.

05:32.162 --> 05:33.596
Whoa,
hang on there!

05:33.629 --> 05:35.262
Sorry, I'm late‐‐
Judge Meyer at the courthouse.

05:35.296 --> 05:36.929
He can wait.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.129
I got the results back
from the lab on that black gunk

05:39.162 --> 05:40.429
we found all over the floater.

05:40.462 --> 05:41.429
Fantastic.
What is it?

05:41.462 --> 05:42.596
Mostly petroleum,

05:42.629 --> 05:43.929
but there's a bio‐mass mixed in,

05:43.962 --> 05:45.596
which doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.

05:45.629 --> 05:47.429
Either way, it's a match.

05:47.462 --> 05:49.596
So, the sample I brought in
from Fair Haven...

05:49.629 --> 05:50.629
Exact same stuff.

05:50.662 --> 05:52.596
(cell phone ringing)

05:52.629 --> 05:53.629
Excuse me.

05:53.662 --> 05:55.829
Agent Moreau.

05:55.862 --> 05:57.596
It's me, Dash.

05:57.629 --> 05:59.762
Speak of the devil.

05:59.796 --> 06:01.462
Look, I need to talk to you.

06:01.496 --> 06:03.429
So talk.

06:03.462 --> 06:05.096
It's a conversation
I'd rather have in person.

06:05.129 --> 06:06.329
Can you come over?

06:06.362 --> 06:08.696
Sure.

06:21.629 --> 06:24.062
(piano playing)

06:27.129 --> 06:28.862
So, are we cool?

06:28.896 --> 06:31.362
Well, I'm not sure.

06:31.396 --> 06:32.662
It seems rather
warm in here to me.

06:32.696 --> 06:33.762
It's an expression.

06:33.796 --> 06:34.862
We're asking if you understand

06:34.896 --> 06:36.162
what we need you to do,

06:36.196 --> 06:37.529
and if you're willing to do it.

06:37.562 --> 06:39.962
Assuming I am able,
you have my word.

06:39.996 --> 06:41.696
Great. We owe you.

06:41.729 --> 06:44.196
Harboring a favor
from the Beauchamps

06:44.229 --> 06:45.829
is fine currency indeed.

06:45.862 --> 06:47.362
If this works,

06:47.396 --> 06:50.596
we may actually live long enough
for you to collect.

06:50.629 --> 06:53.329
And to that, I say‐‐ cool.

06:56.629 --> 06:58.862

This isn't my bedroom.

07:18.996 --> 07:20.929
Yes, it is.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.096
No.

07:23.129 --> 07:25.429
It's an illusion.

07:25.462 --> 07:27.296
Don't take this
the wrong way,

07:27.329 --> 07:30.029
but I wouldn't trust
everything you see.

07:30.062 --> 07:31.362
You're a little high right now.

07:31.396 --> 07:33.829
We're still in the past,
aren't we?

07:33.862 --> 07:36.629
A little less so every second.

07:36.662 --> 07:38.596
But the door...

07:38.629 --> 07:41.129
if we stay here longer,
we'll die.

07:41.162 --> 07:43.129
It's okay,
I know another way out.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.262
Tell me.

07:45.296 --> 07:48.829
When I'm ready, my love.

07:48.862 --> 07:51.029
You make me sick.

07:52.862 --> 07:57.629
Joanna, I won't let
anything hurt you.

07:57.662 --> 08:01.529
You're almost ready
to accept me into your heart.

08:01.562 --> 08:03.596
I can feel it.

08:03.629 --> 08:07.896
You just need a little push.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.162
Looks like you're out.

08:18.196 --> 08:20.329
For now.

08:24.829 --> 08:27.762
I'll be back in two shakes.

08:27.796 --> 08:30.962
Don't go anywhere.

08:38.996 --> 08:42.829
Think of this baby
as an opportunity.

08:42.862 --> 08:44.796
A new beginning.

08:44.829 --> 08:47.129
I don't believe
anything you say.

08:47.162 --> 08:50.529
Besides, I thought you were just
going to kill us all anyway.

08:50.562 --> 08:53.596
I have no interest
in your death.

08:53.629 --> 08:56.962
I only want one
thing from you.

08:56.996 --> 08:58.662
What?

08:58.696 --> 09:01.129
Your power.

09:01.162 --> 09:03.262
Well, not just yours.

09:03.296 --> 09:05.829
Joanna's, Wendy's,
Freya's.

09:05.862 --> 09:08.096
So, that's it?

09:08.129 --> 09:11.362
That's why you're here‐‐
to steal our powers?

09:11.396 --> 09:13.262
Not steal.

09:13.296 --> 09:15.596
Take them back.

09:15.629 --> 09:20.162
The reason you have the gifts
that you do, is because of me.

09:20.196 --> 09:22.429
I do believe
you owe me.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.029
Avolo!
Uh, uh, uh.

09:24.062 --> 09:25.462
Tsk‐tsk‐tsk‐tsk.

09:25.496 --> 09:27.829
Was I not clear?

09:27.862 --> 09:29.796
I've already taken yours.

09:29.829 --> 09:32.962
Thank you for
that, by the way.

09:32.996 --> 09:35.796
I feel more powerful already.

09:37.629 --> 09:40.796
TOMMY: I really would have taken
you to Asgard with me.

09:40.829 --> 09:44.696
But now‐‐ I don't care.

09:44.729 --> 09:48.462
Such a shame.

09:48.496 --> 09:50.829
Now that your magic is gone,

09:50.862 --> 09:54.162
you will live out
your sad little mortal life

09:54.196 --> 09:55.862
in this sad little place.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.629
Vertamus istud!

09:58.662 --> 10:00.462
Frederick!

10:09.496 --> 10:12.129
My dear old boy.

10:12.162 --> 10:14.496
When will you ever learn?

10:27.696 --> 10:29.829
(knocking on door)

10:34.362 --> 10:35.829
Come in.

10:37.696 --> 10:39.462
So?

10:39.496 --> 10:41.262
You said that there
was something

10:41.296 --> 10:42.596
you wanted to talk
to me about?

10:42.629 --> 10:45.096
I believe you have
something of mine.

10:45.129 --> 10:46.162
What are you talking about?

10:46.196 --> 10:47.329
Don't bullshit me.

10:47.362 --> 10:49.096
I know you took them.

10:49.129 --> 10:50.762
Took what?
The books, the journals.

10:50.796 --> 10:53.662
They were on the desk
in the attic... or at least,

10:53.696 --> 10:55.596
they were last night.
And now they're gone.

10:55.629 --> 10:57.462
And you're the only one
who's been here, so...

10:57.496 --> 11:00.629
I didn't take your journals.

11:05.129 --> 11:08.162
Do I need to punish you

11:08.196 --> 11:10.262
to get you to tell the truth?

11:10.296 --> 11:13.929
I'd tread lightly
if I were you.

11:13.962 --> 11:17.162
Oh, yeah?
And why's that?

11:17.196 --> 11:20.329
There's five federal agents
outside of your house right now.

11:26.896 --> 11:28.629
A search warrant?

11:28.662 --> 11:29.529
Are you joking?

11:29.562 --> 11:31.296
I wish I was.
Raven!

11:31.329 --> 11:32.796
You... you actually think

11:32.829 --> 11:34.929
I'm a serial killer
just running around

11:34.962 --> 11:37.762
carving symbols
in people's chests?

11:37.796 --> 11:40.162
Agent Miller, the suspect
has been served.

11:40.196 --> 11:42.162
You can enter the premises.

11:43.162 --> 11:45.162
Sorry, Dash.

11:45.196 --> 11:47.129
This is crazy!

11:47.162 --> 11:49.329
All right, whatever you think
you're going to find here,

11:49.362 --> 11:50.762
you're not.

11:50.796 --> 11:53.862
I hope you're right.

12:00.796 --> 12:02.129
INGRID:
Frederick.

12:02.162 --> 12:04.296
Frederick, wake up.
Please wake up.

12:04.329 --> 12:05.596
Oh, good!

12:05.629 --> 12:06.629
What's happening?

12:06.662 --> 12:08.129
You've lost a lot of blood

12:08.162 --> 12:10.162
and I can't heal you.

12:10.196 --> 12:13.662
Sana... sana.

12:13.696 --> 12:15.696
Oh...

12:15.729 --> 12:17.029
Where's Grandfather?
I don't know.

12:17.062 --> 12:18.696
He left.
Where'd he go?

12:18.729 --> 12:20.662
I don't know, but we should
get out of here, come on.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.629
What? Do you trust
me to help you?

12:22.662 --> 12:23.962
You're still my brother.

12:23.996 --> 12:25.496
And I know you tried to save me.

12:25.529 --> 12:27.829
Plus my powers are gone.
I don't have a choice.

12:27.862 --> 12:30.129
We need to get to Fair Haven.
I think Archibald Browning's

12:30.162 --> 12:32.762
journals might have a spell
that could help us defeat him.

12:32.796 --> 12:34.962
Grandfather wouldn't just leave
us, it has to be a trick.

12:34.996 --> 12:37.429
Or he's counting on us being
too scared to run away.

12:37.462 --> 12:40.129
Either way, let's just
get out of here now.

12:46.029 --> 12:48.496
Hi.

12:48.529 --> 12:50.829
I remember her.
Her name was Agnes.

12:50.862 --> 12:53.496
She was very bendy,
one of our most popular girls.

12:53.529 --> 12:55.962
Oh, there're so many things
wrong with that statement.

12:55.996 --> 12:57.462
Well, it was a different time,
I was a different witch.

12:57.496 --> 12:59.962
Okay, I am officially
worried about your mother.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.462
She should've been back by now.

13:01.496 --> 13:03.096
We need to figure out
where the hell she went.

13:03.129 --> 13:04.462
I'm gonna try and track her.

13:04.496 --> 13:06.296
No! No!
I'll smell her.

13:06.329 --> 13:07.462
What? Come on!

13:07.496 --> 13:09.296
Freya, I will find her.
Trust me.

13:09.329 --> 13:11.296
I'm scared, Wendy.
What if she's not okay?

13:11.329 --> 13:12.796
We don't have that much time.

13:12.829 --> 13:14.596
I know, that's why I have
to shake my tail.

13:14.629 --> 13:17.129
Just meet us in the alley.

13:17.162 --> 13:18.329
Wait!

13:19.696 --> 13:21.529
Not cool, Aunt Wendy.

13:27.696 --> 13:30.929
INGRID: Dash, we need your help
and we don't have much time.

13:30.962 --> 13:32.329
Okay, what is it?

13:32.362 --> 13:34.962
FREDERICK:
Show me Archibald's journals.

13:34.996 --> 13:36.529
I don't have them anymore.
What?!

13:36.562 --> 13:38.096
Where did they go?
I don't know.

13:38.129 --> 13:39.762
When I woke up,
they were just gone.

13:39.796 --> 13:41.596
Did you read them?
Yeah.

13:41.629 --> 13:43.496
I looked through them, but all
the spells were in Old Norse.

13:43.529 --> 13:44.796
I didn't understand anything.

13:44.829 --> 13:45.962
How many did you look through?

13:45.996 --> 13:46.962
All of them.

13:46.996 --> 13:49.262
Great.

13:49.296 --> 13:52.462
Dash, you swore you wouldn't
read the journals.

13:52.496 --> 13:54.262
You said you wouldn't
even touch them.

13:54.296 --> 13:55.962
It's actually good
that he read them.

13:55.996 --> 13:57.429
Ingrid, you said that the
journals may contain a spell

13:57.462 --> 13:58.596
that would help us
defeat Grandfather.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.762
If he looked through
all of them,

13:59.796 --> 14:01.129
the pages are locked
in his mind.

14:01.162 --> 14:01.996
And I can get them out.

14:02.029 --> 14:03.429
How?
With a mind spell.

14:03.462 --> 14:05.096
I'll be able to extract

14:05.129 --> 14:07.162
the information
directly from your subconscious.

Edgar.

15:25.829 --> 15:28.329
I'm sorry. I have to go.

15:28.362 --> 15:31.529
Then I'm going with you.

15:44.962 --> 15:47.062

16:08.496 --> 16:11.462

16:28.196 --> 16:30.462
Thank you
for doing this, Dash.

16:30.496 --> 16:32.129
Yeah.

16:32.162 --> 16:35.129
Look, Ingrid, there's
something I need to tell you.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.162
There was an FBI
agent here earlier.

16:38.196 --> 16:40.329
What?!
She had a search warrant.

16:40.362 --> 16:42.329
And‐and she confiscated
a lot of things.

16:42.362 --> 16:44.929
Dash, your computer,
those e‐mails from Kyle Hutton!

16:44.962 --> 16:46.429
They're gone.

16:46.462 --> 16:48.496
I wiped the hard drive.
It's totally clean.

16:48.529 --> 16:50.496
The‐the thing is...

16:50.529 --> 16:53.096
I need you to know
that no matter what happens,

16:53.129 --> 16:55.462
I'll keep you out of it.

16:55.496 --> 16:57.429
You can't keep me
out of it, Dash.

16:57.462 --> 16:58.462
I helped you.

16:58.496 --> 16:59.496
No one knows that.

16:59.529 --> 17:01.362
And no one ever will.

17:01.396 --> 17:04.962
As far as I'm concerned,
you were never here.

17:07.296 --> 17:08.962
FREDERICK:
Dash, we have to get started.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.996
Let's go.

17:15.229 --> 17:17.796
You have to let go.
Unlock your mind to me.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.962
That's the only way
this will work.

17:19.996 --> 17:21.162
I'll do my best.

17:21.196 --> 17:23.529
Ingrid, translate fast.

17:33.229 --> 17:36.296
Ek lita innan hirtha!

17:36.329 --> 17:39.529
Ek lita

17:45.696 --> 17:47.462
This spell is
about switching souls

17:47.496 --> 17:49.529
with another witch.
It won't help us. Keep going.

17:49.562 --> 17:51.496
Ek eigi ni kunna...

17:51.529 --> 17:54.362
Summoning a demon?

17:54.396 --> 17:58.062
(Frederick continues speaking
in ancient language)

18:05.329 --> 18:07.529
Reanimating dead flesh.

18:11.529 --> 18:13.029
Inducing madness.

18:21.162 --> 18:22.829
(chuckles)

18:22.862 --> 18:24.862
What are you doing
down there?

18:28.329 --> 18:30.129
(cries out)

18:30.162 --> 18:32.096
You've been a bad little girl.

18:32.129 --> 18:33.529
Let's get back into bed.

18:33.562 --> 18:35.562
(grunting)

18:53.329 --> 18:55.696
I think it's time
to up your dosage.

18:58.162 --> 18:59.796
(grunts)

19:01.629 --> 19:02.929
Guess you can't read
a cat's thoughts.

19:02.962 --> 19:05.996
Come on.
We got to get out of here.

19:10.162 --> 19:12.796
(grunts)

19:12.829 --> 19:15.162
(gurgles, moans)

19:19.629 --> 19:21.262
Let's go.

19:21.296 --> 19:22.596
On the table.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.129
The talisman.

19:24.829 --> 19:27.196
Incendio!

19:31.029 --> 19:33.662
Oh! The soul‐sucking
box thing!

19:33.696 --> 19:36.696
Got it.

19:43.829 --> 19:45.329
(indistinct chatter)

19:46.284 --> 19:47.951
We can check the wharf.

19:47.984 --> 19:50.251
We've already checked there.
We've lost him.

19:50.284 --> 19:52.518
I should go to the alley
and meet them.

19:52.551 --> 19:54.251
(groans)

19:54.284 --> 19:55.518
Oh, my!

19:55.551 --> 19:57.051
I'm not feeling well.

19:57.084 --> 19:59.251
You're bleeding!

19:59.284 --> 20:01.951
It's already happening.

20:01.984 --> 20:03.551
What is?

20:05.084 --> 20:06.251
Nothing.

20:06.284 --> 20:07.918
Wendy will come through.

20:07.951 --> 20:09.118
We will make it home.

20:09.151 --> 20:10.384
Ingrid will find a way.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.551
Of course she will.

20:11.584 --> 20:13.951
I'll go with you and wait.
No.

20:13.984 --> 20:15.018
Please don't‐‐ I want you

20:15.051 --> 20:17.018
to remember me like this.

20:17.051 --> 20:18.284
Why?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.418
What's going to happen to you?

20:20.451 --> 20:22.684
If all goes well, nothing.

20:22.718 --> 20:25.051
But my luck hasn't
been the best lately.

20:25.084 --> 20:27.051
I've already lost you once.

20:27.084 --> 20:28.584
I can't do it again.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.851
I don't think I'll survive.

20:30.884 --> 20:32.851
I love you.

20:32.884 --> 20:35.784
Edgar, I know it doesn't
seem like much,

20:35.818 --> 20:37.884
and it's a long time to wait,

20:37.918 --> 20:39.784
but you will see me again.

20:39.818 --> 20:42.451
Just not in this life.

20:42.484 --> 20:46.018
I have to get home to my love.

20:46.051 --> 20:48.784
I envy him.

20:48.818 --> 20:52.618
You will be him someday.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.051
Our souls are connected.

20:55.084 --> 20:56.518
Forever.

20:56.551 --> 20:59.051
No matter what may
try to keep us apart,

20:59.084 --> 21:01.584
we always find each other.

21:01.618 --> 21:03.784
Never forget that.

21:11.451 --> 21:13.218
You'll see me again.

21:13.251 --> 21:14.618
I promise.

21:19.151 --> 21:20.718
Good‐bye, my love.

21:20.751 --> 21:23.718
Good‐bye.

with the dagger.

21:53.084 --> 21:54.051
The traveler,
the bridge, the key...

21:54.084 --> 21:55.251
I think
this is it!

21:58.384 --> 21:59.884
Dash, are you okay?

22:00.751 --> 22:02.551
I've been better.

22:02.584 --> 22:03.951
(heavy knocking at door)

22:05.884 --> 22:07.084
Do you think that's Grandfather?

22:07.118 --> 22:08.551
(knocking continues)

22:08.584 --> 22:10.184
No, he wouldn't knock.
Come on.

22:10.218 --> 22:12.551
Let's go.

22:12.584 --> 22:14.584
Yeah.

22:21.884 --> 22:23.684
I'm looking for
Ingrid Beauchamp.

22:23.718 --> 22:26.551
I'm sorry, do I know you?

22:26.584 --> 22:28.418
We've met.

22:28.451 --> 22:31.084
I've been waiting a very
long time for this day.

22:31.118 --> 22:32.351
I have a message

22:32.384 --> 22:33.684
from Wendy and Freya.

22:33.718 --> 22:35.551
I've been carrying
this with me

22:35.584 --> 22:37.684
for 166 years.

22:37.718 --> 22:41.251
They need your help
getting home.

22:49.584 --> 22:50.984

22:57.884 --> 22:59.418

22:59.451 --> 23:02.118

23:15.418 --> 23:17.118
Freya, we're coming!

23:17.784 --> 23:20.118
It's Tarkoff! Run!

23:20.151 --> 23:21.451
Run!

23:21.484 --> 23:22.751
Go!

23:27.984 --> 23:29.884
Freya! Come on!

23:30.484 --> 23:31.384
Oh, my God...

23:31.418 --> 23:32.951
It's open, hurry!

23:32.984 --> 23:34.518
Go, Wendy.

23:34.551 --> 23:36.051
Joanna...
Go!

23:37.418 --> 23:39.384
Fraendo!

23:44.784 --> 23:47.418
Hurry!
Freya!

23:47.451 --> 23:49.418
Hurry!

23:49.451 --> 23:51.784
You're a sight!
I could kiss you.

23:53.584 --> 23:55.618
INGRID:
Come on, hurry! Hurry!

24:07.918 --> 24:10.484

24:24.217 --> 24:26.850
Tunc evanescunt ostium!

24:28.084 --> 24:30.050
(exhales)

24:32.017 --> 24:34.750
Oh.

24:35.750 --> 24:36.884
I'm not bleeding anymore.

24:36.917 --> 24:38.150
Told you I knew
we'd make it.

24:38.184 --> 24:39.050
No, you didn't.

24:39.084 --> 24:40.350
No, you're right.

24:40.384 --> 24:41.584
I thought we were
all dead for sure.

24:42.550 --> 24:44.150
JOANNA:
Frederick.

24:44.184 --> 24:46.417
He helped us, Mom.
We could not have built

24:46.450 --> 24:48.984
the new time door without him.
He really is on our side.

24:49.017 --> 24:50.984
I'll do whatever I can
to help you defeat him.

24:51.017 --> 24:53.317
He lied to all of us.
I should've known.

24:53.350 --> 24:54.517
He just wants your power.

24:54.550 --> 24:56.317
He already took mine.

24:56.350 --> 24:58.517
What?
(gasps)

24:58.550 --> 24:59.984
INGRID:
What happened?
FREYA: What is going on?

25:00.017 --> 25:01.550
(gasps)

25:01.584 --> 25:03.817
Where's Wendy?

25:03.850 --> 25:05.484
He's taken her.

25:05.517 --> 25:07.417
(gasping)

25:08.350 --> 25:10.484
I guess we'll just have

25:10.517 --> 25:12.050
to do this one by one.

25:14.350 --> 25:16.684
You were always
my least favorite child.

25:16.717 --> 25:19.684
I'm going to enjoy
killing you first.

25:23.350 --> 25:24.484
Where is she?

25:24.517 --> 25:25.750
I'll go check the attic.

25:25.784 --> 25:26.884
INGRID: Maybe they're
in the catacombs.

25:26.917 --> 25:28.217
JOANNA:
I can track her,

25:28.250 --> 25:29.684
but I dropped the Anima Aucupe

25:29.717 --> 25:31.384
in Baltimore, and it broke.

25:31.417 --> 25:33.250
After everything
we've gone through, it's gone.

25:33.284 --> 25:35.084
So now we don't have
a way to stop him?

25:35.117 --> 25:36.550
INGRID:
Actually, I think we do.

25:36.584 --> 25:38.184
I found a spell, but
it requires me and you

25:38.217 --> 25:40.517
and Mom and Wendy,
and I don't know

25:40.550 --> 25:42.484
if it will work because
my powers are gone.

25:42.517 --> 25:43.984
Well, we have to try.

25:44.017 --> 25:45.484
All right, I'm game.
Let's do this.

25:45.517 --> 25:47.184
Let me come,

No, Frederick.

25:47.217 --> 25:49.017
This spell requires
the key, the dagger,

25:49.050 --> 25:50.850
the bridge, the traveler
and that's it.

25:50.884 --> 25:52.250
Wait, what does that mean?

25:52.284 --> 25:53.484
It's us.

25:53.517 --> 25:55.717
I'm the key,
you're the traveler,

25:55.750 --> 25:57.317
Mom's the dagger,
Wendy's the bridge.

25:57.350 --> 25:58.917
I... I don't understand.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.017
I don't exactly
understand it myself,

26:01.050 --> 26:02.917
but apparently we each
have a unique gift.

26:02.950 --> 26:05.517
Grandfather knows this, and
that's why he wants our powers.

26:05.550 --> 26:07.017
And that's why a spell

26:07.050 --> 26:08.650
to stop him requires
we put these powers together.

26:08.684 --> 26:10.150
You can't help us

26:10.184 --> 26:11.984
with this, you'll only
put yourself in danger.

26:12.017 --> 26:14.450
Okay.
You stay here.

26:15.517 --> 26:16.884
Let's go.

26:19.284 --> 26:20.684
Mom.

26:22.717 --> 26:24.084
I love you.

26:24.117 --> 26:26.117
I know.

26:29.584 --> 26:31.250
JOANNA:
Let's go kick some ass.

26:35.217 --> 26:38.050
Do you know why I
gave you your curse?

26:38.084 --> 26:40.350
I don't care.

26:40.384 --> 26:41.684
You're a coward.

26:41.717 --> 26:43.717
You always reminded
me of a cat.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.517
A cold predator

26:45.550 --> 26:48.550
who only gives love
when it serves her purposes.

26:48.584 --> 26:51.417
Or maybe I just never loved you.

26:51.450 --> 26:53.317
Remember when you were a child?

26:53.350 --> 26:55.417
You and Joanna would
play with dolls.

26:55.450 --> 26:57.917
I knew even then
she'd be a good mother,

26:57.950 --> 26:59.417
but you, on
the other hand,

26:59.450 --> 27:02.517
you always... lost yours.

27:02.550 --> 27:03.884
Or broke them.

27:03.917 --> 27:06.350
You were never a
selfless nurturer

27:06.384 --> 27:08.150
like your
sister.

27:08.184 --> 27:11.017
That is why I made sure you
could never have children.

27:11.050 --> 27:13.217
To spare them

27:13.250 --> 27:17.017
the horror of having you
as a mother.

27:17.050 --> 27:18.550
I know who I am.

27:18.584 --> 27:20.317
Even though
I'm not a mother,

27:20.350 --> 27:23.350
I'll risk anything
for the people that I love.

27:23.384 --> 27:26.017
Not for much longer.

27:27.250 --> 27:29.884
Of course,
if you beg,

27:29.917 --> 27:33.084
I will take your power...

27:33.117 --> 27:34.484
and spare your last life.

27:34.517 --> 27:37.217
Kill me if you want.

27:37.250 --> 27:39.817
You can't hurt me anymore.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.817
Every time you try,

27:41.850 --> 27:43.217
I just get stronger.

27:43.250 --> 27:45.317

27:45.350 --> 27:46.884
Oh... that's
the only thing

27:46.917 --> 27:48.984
I ever admired about you,
my dear.

27:49.017 --> 27:50.550
Your bravado.

27:50.584 --> 27:51.850
You got that from me.

27:51.884 --> 27:54.350
I don't admire
anything about you.

27:54.384 --> 27:58.184
You're just a sad,
weak old man

27:58.217 --> 28:00.050
with no one to love!

28:03.550 --> 28:06.550

in a lake of fire

waiting for your

28:09.417 --> 28:12.250
final judgment at the
hands of your sister.

28:12.284 --> 28:15.384
Your torture is just beginning.

28:19.617 --> 28:21.250
Dashiell Gardiner,
you're under arrest.

28:21.284 --> 28:24.750
For what?
Raven, I...
You wiped
your hard drive.

28:24.784 --> 28:26.484
But right now,
destruction of evidence

28:26.517 --> 28:27.684
is the least
of your charges.

28:27.717 --> 28:29.484
What charges?
Murder.

28:29.517 --> 28:31.550
Since we couldn't get the
information off your computer,

28:31.584 --> 28:32.984
we checked the
ISP servers.

28:33.017 --> 28:35.150
We found some
threatening e‐mails.

28:35.184 --> 28:36.717
Clearly, someone
was blackmailing you

28:36.750 --> 28:38.817
for attempting
to murder your brother.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.850
We traced those
to Kyle Hutton.

28:40.884 --> 28:43.417
Which then got
me thinking.

28:43.450 --> 28:46.084
So I ran a DNA test
on the murder victim

28:46.117 --> 28:48.550
that washed up on shore
a few days ago.

28:48.584 --> 28:49.984
We got a match.

28:50.017 --> 28:51.384
Kyle Hutton.
