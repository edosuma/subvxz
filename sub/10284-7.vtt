WEBVTT

00:03.860 --> 00:05.291
Previously on E.R...

00:05.361 --> 00:07.025
So you're a proponent
of a national health plan?

00:07.033 --> 00:10.916
If we had one, this guy would be home playing
with his kids instead of fighting for his life.

00:12.535 --> 00:13.514
That was gold.

00:13.527 --> 00:16.227
I want these two out of my O.R.--
Shirley, call security.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.318
- Nice working with you guys.
- Bovie...

00:18.482 --> 00:20.053
- Stand back!
- You want to hook up?

00:20.067 --> 00:22.107
- Hook up?
- Yeah, prep for the M&M.

00:22.117 --> 00:23.992
Thought I'd give you a head's up
before I kick your ass.

00:24.005 --> 00:27.090
- Uh, is, uh... is Tony there?
- I'm sorry, he's a little busy right now.

00:27.104 --> 00:29.612
- Nobody here goes to the doctor?
- Hell no. - Not me.

00:29.621 --> 00:34.228
I just don't know how to fix this.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

00:54.200 --> 00:55.522
Yo, Dr. K.

00:56.239 --> 00:59.801
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Oh, my God, he's so cute.

00:59.997 --> 01:00.923
Hi, Joe.

01:00.938 --> 01:03.083
Don't let the good looks fool you.
He's a tough one.

01:03.085 --> 01:05.470
- Takes after his mom, huh?
- Ain't that the truth.

01:05.485 --> 01:07.640
- Let me give you a hand, doc.
- Thanks.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.690
Our babysitter couldn't make it again.
We finally decided to hire a nanny.

01:11.707 --> 01:14.880
My mom raised eight kids all by herself.
I don't know how she did it.

01:14.895 --> 01:16.943
She available?
So what about your S.B.O. guy.

01:16.946 --> 01:19.872
- Waiting on surgery.
- And your chemo boy in 4?

01:19.886 --> 01:22.850
Up to oncology about a half hour ago.
Who's this, the new chief of ER?

01:22.856 --> 01:24.900
Yep, training him so I can retire early.

01:24.915 --> 01:26.670
Good. We could use some
new blood around here.

01:26.676 --> 01:28.852
- I'm new.
- You're too old to be new, Gates.

01:29.907 --> 01:31.430
Excuse me, Dr. Weaver, hi.

01:31.445 --> 01:33.973
Courtney Brown, Channel 5.
Have you got a minute?

01:33.975 --> 01:35.410
Not really--
give me the half-inch, please.

01:35.416 --> 01:38.572
The station loved you
and our segment that we did.

01:38.588 --> 01:40.580
They've given us a green
light to do some more.

01:40.918 --> 01:44.162
- Wow, that sounds cool.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

01:44.176 --> 01:47.040
I'm an ER doc, not a TV personality.

01:47.057 --> 01:49.391
That's exactly what we're looking for:
someone real.

01:49.405 --> 01:51.941
You'd be really great, Dr. Weaver.
That piece you did was so good.

01:51.958 --> 01:54.010
You know what, why don't you take over.

01:54.027 --> 01:56.863
Pack all four quadrants
and Dawn can help you.

01:56.905 --> 01:59.030
GYN has a bed, but they can't take
the P.I.D. for two hours.

01:59.035 --> 02:01.403
- Dr. Weaver, radiology on two.
- Sorry, I got to take this.

02:01.415 --> 02:03.632
Oh, I get it, you're swamped.
I'll try to buzz you later.

02:03.637 --> 02:06.470
- I think he has Abby's eyes.
- Yeah, and his dad's head.

02:06.487 --> 02:09.092
- Yeah.
- He'll grow into it.

02:11.925 --> 02:14.141
Could you guys keep an eye
on him for a minute?

02:14.156 --> 02:15.313
Yeah.

02:16.676 --> 02:17.683
Mr. Ames.

02:18.785 --> 02:19.721
Luka.

02:20.657 --> 02:23.451
Can I, uh...
Can I help you with something?

02:23.597 --> 02:28.062
No, no. Got a meeting
with Angela Gilliam upstairs.

02:31.458 --> 02:32.653
About my appeal.

02:34.117 --> 02:35.850
- She didn't tell you?
- No, no.

02:36.107 --> 02:39.733
Yeah, need to copy
some of my hospital files.

02:40.275 --> 02:43.661
- You're appealing the case?
- Only if I have to.

02:44.356 --> 02:48.630
You know, a settlement would save the
hospital a lot of time and a lot of money.

02:49.576 --> 02:52.731
Look, this hasn't been
easy on any of us.

02:53.397 --> 02:56.251
Least of all you, but...

02:56.776 --> 02:58.063
But what?

03:00.378 --> 03:04.100
Maybe it's time to move on,
put the past behind you.

03:04.778 --> 03:06.032
I couldn't agree more.

03:10.415 --> 03:12.132
I'm going to hop up the stairs.

03:12.786 --> 03:14.291
I'll see you around.

03:32.177 --> 03:36.170
I can smell 'em.
You can't, but I can.

03:36.548 --> 03:40.602
They're here now.
I can smell 'em; you can't smell 'em.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.561
I can smell 'em...

04:14.807 --> 04:15.832
Hey.

04:16.646 --> 04:19.012
- Are those Hot Wheels?
- Want one?

04:19.028 --> 04:20.180
Yeah.

04:22.405 --> 04:25.083
I got lots of Hot Wheels, too.

04:25.498 --> 04:28.001
- What is this one?
- I don't know.

04:28.178 --> 04:29.502
Number five.

04:33.725 --> 04:34.920
Get off the floor.

04:34.935 --> 04:37.390
- Come on, don't make me embarrass you.
- Mom, I'm racing!

04:37.408 --> 04:39.932
Get over here now.
Come on.

04:42.607 --> 04:43.982
Get out of the way, man!

04:44.005 --> 04:47.182
Fast food guy dumped some hot oil.
Third degree burns to his hands and wrists.

04:47.607 --> 04:49.263
Exam Three is open.

04:49.855 --> 04:54.433
You can't, but I can.
I can smell 'em.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.272
Hey!

05:17.958 --> 05:21.231
Maybe you haven't noticed, but
you got a few people waiting out here.

05:21.245 --> 05:24.812
You actually got any doctors working
back there? What is it, golf day?!

05:24.826 --> 05:26.110
Sir, please sit down.

05:26.128 --> 05:29.801
Don't "sir" me, bitch,
just let me see a damn doctor!

05:29.817 --> 05:31.663
Calm down, or I'll call security.

05:31.675 --> 05:34.541
Oh, oh, oh, call 'em--
go ahead, I'm right here.

05:37.345 --> 05:39.290
- What?
- Calm down now.

05:39.307 --> 05:41.663
You are not the only patient here, okay?

05:42.006 --> 05:43.551
Yeah, I can see that.

05:44.328 --> 05:45.610
I can see that.

05:46.505 --> 05:47.663
You sign in?

05:47.678 --> 05:50.462
Signed in what?
All I got's a little congestion.

05:51.205 --> 05:53.652
You think you morons can handle that?!

05:56.137 --> 05:57.401
Fill this out.

06:03.006 --> 06:05.970
If you sit down and shut up, I'll bring
you back here in a few minutes.

06:05.985 --> 06:08.181
I just got the flu, for God's sake.

06:08.435 --> 06:11.473
I want to apologize in advance
for the smell in the break room.

06:11.476 --> 06:14.321
- Luka changed Joe's diaper in there.
- Wow, how bad is it?

06:14.417 --> 06:17.013
- We've got a men's room, you know.
- It's not carrots, is it? I hate carrots.

06:17.015 --> 06:19.562
You know, I said I'm sorry.
My babysitter flaked.

06:19.577 --> 06:21.510
I feel bad enough dragging him in here.

06:21.526 --> 06:24.763
- Hey, has Radiology called back yet?
- Nah, I don't think so.

06:24.777 --> 06:28.583
Excuse me, I'm here
to see Dr. Luka Kovac.

06:33.956 --> 06:37.042
- How long you been congested?
- I don't know. Does it matter?

06:37.088 --> 06:39.611
No, I'm just making conversation.

06:40.996 --> 06:42.422
About a month or so.

06:42.448 --> 06:45.222
- All right, what do we got?
- Temp's 99.

06:45.597 --> 06:48.050
- U.R.I. symptoms.
- The flu.

06:49.446 --> 06:50.853
Deep breath for me, please.

06:51.207 --> 06:53.571
Get that damn thing off of me!
It's freezing!

06:53.586 --> 06:58.140
- I have to take a listen, sir.
- I told you asshole... it's the flu.

06:58.155 --> 07:02.181
Now just give me some antibiotics
or something, and let me out of here.

07:02.198 --> 07:06.493
Listen, Prince Charming, the quicker
we check you out, the quicker you can go.

07:06.766 --> 07:08.872
I need to check the oxygen in your blood.

07:09.176 --> 07:10.242
Part of the exam.

07:11.368 --> 07:13.491
- Omit that part.
- All right.

07:13.838 --> 07:19.332
Look, you have the flu, that's an easy fix.
Then you can go home.

07:19.698 --> 07:21.791
Believe me, I want you to go.

07:22.145 --> 07:23.672
I need you to go.

07:26.008 --> 07:27.803
Wow, Rio.

07:28.196 --> 07:32.102
- So Chicago must be a big change.
- Have you been here for a winter yet?

07:32.116 --> 07:37.513
No, but I love the cold.
In Brazil is always sunshine.

07:40.087 --> 07:41.932
Geez, that must have been hard to manage.

07:41.945 --> 07:46.953
- Um, why did you leave your last job?
- I didn't really like New York.

07:46.965 --> 07:49.992
I wanted a change around the scenery, huh?

07:50.107 --> 07:54.311
Change of scenery.
You wanted change of scenery.

07:54.327 --> 07:57.983
- Ah, sorry. My English.
- I still make mistakes.

07:59.866 --> 08:01.921
Great.
Thanks for coming by.

08:02.105 --> 08:04.623
Discipline.
Discipline.

08:04.906 --> 08:07.071
Especially with the little boys.

08:07.106 --> 08:08.811
This is key.

08:09.497 --> 08:12.213
Amway money ran out along
with my husband.

08:12.228 --> 08:15.263
So I asked myself,
"Jackie, what do you love?"

08:15.576 --> 08:18.960
Kids, love kids.
Crazy little bastards.

08:19.357 --> 08:21.632
Oh, hey, can I smoke in here?

08:21.908 --> 08:24.373
It was the best ten years of my life.

08:24.655 --> 08:26.720
I really loved those kids.

08:27.737 --> 08:31.581
I don't want to brag, but
for all the families I've worked for,

08:31.787 --> 08:34.971
the kids always end up calling me
Mommy by the third week.

08:37.176 --> 08:40.049
Okay, great.
Thanks for coming by.

08:42.058 --> 08:43.500
What, you get lost?

08:43.677 --> 08:45.502
Seems to be a little problem
with your heart.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.641
Is that from the flu?

08:48.657 --> 08:51.962
Normal heart's about the size of a fist.
Yours is twice that big.

08:51.976 --> 08:55.220
I don't think you have the flu.
Your congestion, shortness of breath--

08:55.237 --> 08:58.790
- definitely because of your heart.
- Sorry, I couldn't find the sonosite.

08:59.674 --> 09:02.842
How many times do I have to tell you
to lay down and put the gown on.

09:02.901 --> 09:06.038
- I ain't wearing that dress.
- Then lose the shirt.

09:08.780 --> 09:11.552
You can at least by me dinner first.

09:12.099 --> 09:15.131
Do you get in a lot of fights?
Have an accident or something?

09:15.145 --> 09:18.631
You got what look like old fractures,
a lot of them--

09:18.648 --> 09:22.511
- a few ribs, collarbone, your arm.
- I was an active kid.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.091
What about the scar and those burns?

09:28.707 --> 09:33.820
Yeah, well, my pop had
a two-pack-a-day habit.

09:49.906 --> 09:52.692
Whoa. He's got a pericardial effusion.

09:54.736 --> 09:56.803
- A what?
- Fluid around your heart.

09:56.818 --> 09:59.192
Which restricts blood flow
and makes it hard for you to breathe.

09:59.206 --> 10:02.213
I.V. Two of Ativan,
set up for pericardiocentesis.

10:02.596 --> 10:04.753
Hang on.
W-what are you doing?

10:04.756 --> 10:08.493
Sir, we need to do a procedure where I place
a needle into the sac around your heart.

10:08.506 --> 10:10.410
- It's no big deal.
- What?

10:13.275 --> 10:15.001
No. No way.

10:15.038 --> 10:17.022
- You need this procedure.
- No, I don't.

10:17.037 --> 10:19.782
- Yes, you do. You could die.
- Non! Not a chance!

10:20.518 --> 10:21.902
You son of a bitch!

10:22.808 --> 10:25.192
Where'd you get the doctor degree,
through the mail?!

10:29.905 --> 10:33.582
Get out while you can
before Kevorkian starts sticking you!

10:39.777 --> 10:41.441
Let me the hell out of here!

10:42.278 --> 10:44.081
Now!!

10:52.076 --> 10:54.152
What could we do for you today, sir?

10:54.467 --> 10:56.300
I just need my cholesterol prescription refilled.

10:56.325 --> 10:59.450
Cholesterol,silent killer.
It is so good that you're being vigilant.

10:59.467 --> 11:02.563
Dr. Wong from the Family Medical Center
prescribed this for you?

11:02.575 --> 11:04.212
And why didn't you go back to her?

11:04.225 --> 11:07.292
Well, they can't take me for a few months.
I'm supposed to get a blood test, too.

11:07.306 --> 11:10.141
- Check my liver when I'm on the stuff.
- You need to see Dr. Wong.

11:10.146 --> 11:13.380
I'll call up personally and make sure they
know to give you an earlier appointment.

11:13.398 --> 11:16.503
Doc, please, I don't know
when I can take another day off.

11:16.518 --> 11:19.091
I work two jobs. I got his Grandma
watching him all the time.

11:19.097 --> 11:21.763
Okay, I'll call up right now
and let them know you're coming.

11:21.776 --> 11:25.740
Hope, please discharge Mr. Batista
and point him to the Family Center.

11:25.757 --> 11:28.701
Hey, Morris, why is Grasso
still in Curtain Two?

11:28.715 --> 11:30.261
Vertigo guy is still here?

11:30.276 --> 11:33.320
You know, mine felt better after meclizine,
O.T.D. in 45 minutes.

11:33.338 --> 11:36.003
Give him a break-- his first shift
in a month he hasn't killed anybody.

11:36.017 --> 11:37.972
My case is a little bit more
complicated than that, Ray.

11:37.975 --> 11:40.982
- You have an abnormal neuro exam?
- I just have a clinical hunch, okay?

11:40.996 --> 11:42.341
Takes years to develop.

11:42.356 --> 11:45.492
- CT results from radiology.
- That for your vertigo guy?

11:46.127 --> 11:47.630
It's normal, isn't it?

11:48.636 --> 11:50.902
Then we can all sleep a little bit
better tonight, can't we?

11:50.927 --> 11:54.001
Sam, could you please get something
from the drug sample closet?

11:54.008 --> 11:56.431
- There's a limited amount of samples.
- You should ask an attending to write...

11:56.446 --> 11:59.211
Dr. Weaver asked me to get it
for one of her patients.

11:59.227 --> 12:00.652
Oh, okay.

12:00.668 --> 12:05.393
No, yeah, it's Batista. B-a-t-i-s-t-a.
Thank you.

12:05.995 --> 12:08.763
That TV news gal,
Courtney Brown called again.

12:08.877 --> 12:11.370
Oh, Channel 5 Courtney Brown?
What'd she want?

12:11.407 --> 12:13.471
She offered me a job as a reporter.

12:13.506 --> 12:14.662
What, you?!

12:15.027 --> 12:17.332
I m... of course you.
What did you say?

12:17.336 --> 12:18.340
I turned it down.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.853
You turned down the chance
to be the next Sanjay Gupta?

12:20.867 --> 12:23.673
- Are you insane, woman?
- I have no interest in fluff pieces

12:23.678 --> 12:26.281
- about sunburns and bee stings.
- What's wrong with fluff?

12:26.295 --> 12:28.641
Half the patients who come through
here are fluff. I'm the king of fluff.

12:28.658 --> 12:30.620
Word is, you're the best fluffer in town.

12:30.627 --> 12:34.002
- Hope, you ready for that fecal impaction?
- Sure I am.

12:44.377 --> 12:46.972
This is an extremely uncommon error.

12:46.987 --> 12:50.601
Our personnel were clearly
distracted by the ongoing debate.

12:50.886 --> 12:53.262
It's all the more reason why ER
docs should remain in the ER.

12:53.276 --> 12:56.052
I know "ER" sounds a lot
like "O.R.", but it's not.

12:56.065 --> 12:58.802
Our guys were up there trying to keep
your guys from making mistakes.

12:58.816 --> 13:01.712
Based on the information we had,
our decision to operate was correct.

13:01.727 --> 13:04.931
Well, you know what?
You didn't have sufficient information,

13:04.937 --> 13:07.082
because you didn't allow us
to complete a full evaluation.

13:07.097 --> 13:11.182
This isn't a wich hunt, people. We're here
to learn from our mistakes and improve.

13:11.195 --> 13:12.712
You mean their mistakes, right?

13:12.717 --> 13:15.231
Okay, let's not forget that
we're on the same team here.

13:16.008 --> 13:17.933
Oh, Dr. Gates, come on in.

13:19.207 --> 13:22.402
- You missed a case presentation.
- Sorry, I had a patient.

13:22.418 --> 13:24.023
You know what? Sorry.
I just got to...

13:24.037 --> 13:26.761
No, that's okay. Timely enough,
Dr. Gates.  No need to sit.

13:27.145 --> 13:28.311
Come on down.

13:28.708 --> 13:34.373
Why don't you tell us what the differential
diagnosis was when this patient presented.

13:35.108 --> 13:38.523
Um... triple-A was on the top of our list.

13:39.008 --> 13:40.770
But there were other possibilities.

13:42.176 --> 13:43.713
I should've stayed a resident.

13:43.876 --> 13:47.592
No responsibilities, just heal 'em
and deal 'em. That was the life.

13:47.995 --> 13:51.401
Morris, can I tell you something as a friend?

13:52.436 --> 13:55.013
Sometimes you are such a little bitch!

13:55.296 --> 13:57.680
You make three times as much as I do.

13:57.696 --> 14:00.370
And for what?
To give orders instead of take them?

14:00.715 --> 14:02.571
Boo-hoo for you.

14:03.215 --> 14:04.150
Mr. Batista!

14:04.168 --> 14:06.222
Hey, Hope, we got a double coming in,
you might want to jump on.

14:06.225 --> 14:08.661
I'll be right there, Dr. Morris.
Mr. Batista, wait.

14:08.908 --> 14:11.653
Um... I called the Family Care Center.

14:11.665 --> 14:13.160
I heard they can't take you
for another month.

14:13.178 --> 14:15.942
I'm very sorry about all that.
The system's...

14:16.008 --> 14:18.482
Well... it needs work.

14:19.206 --> 14:23.570
Lovastatin.
30 pills, 20 milligrams each.

14:23.658 --> 14:26.800
Shh. This should hold you
till your next appointment.

14:28.935 --> 14:29.950
Thanks a lot.

14:30.375 --> 14:33.582
- This is us, Hope.
- Unidentified male, early 20s.

14:33.597 --> 14:36.512
Altercation on a bus,
blunt trauma to the chest and face.

14:36.526 --> 14:39.173
Ray, Malik, you take this.
Trauma Two is open.

14:39.188 --> 14:40.410
Sam, Hope, you're with me.

14:40.425 --> 14:44.302
He's tachy in the 120s,
resps in the 30s, BP 104/56.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.482
CBC, I.V., type and cross, let's go!

14:48.178 --> 14:51.450
Fred Douglas, 38, blunt trauma
to the face with epistaxis.

14:51.467 --> 14:53.612
- Son of a bitch broke my nose.
- Keep pressure on it.

14:53.617 --> 14:55.061
Dude was yelling
at some lady on the bus.

14:55.075 --> 14:57.883
I tell him to shut up, next thing you
know he's throwing punches.

14:59.207 --> 15:01.192
- How you doing in there, Ray?
- I'm doing good.

15:01.216 --> 15:03.082
He could probably use when you done.

15:03.175 --> 15:06.322
That guy I got in a fight with--
I didn't hurt him too bad, did I?

15:06.338 --> 15:07.642
Hemocue's 12.8.

15:07.776 --> 15:11.910
First, we look for an obvious source
of bleeding that can be cauterized.

15:11.927 --> 15:14.232
Is it broken, Doc?
It sure fe...

15:16.905 --> 15:18.353
God bless you.

15:19.326 --> 15:20.832
Snuck up on me. Sorry.

15:20.835 --> 15:22.881
You need a definitive triple-A diagnosis

15:22.898 --> 15:25.473
before committing an unstable patient
to major surgery.

15:25.487 --> 15:28.630
Au contraire.
Mortality of ruptured triple-A is 90%.

15:28.648 --> 15:29.930
We don't have time
to wait around for tests.

15:29.947 --> 15:31.802
Ultrasound can be done
very quickly at the bedside.

15:31.816 --> 15:33.642
Theoretically, perhaps,
but not in this ER--

15:33.658 --> 15:35.713
besides, every textbook in print says
that this type of patient

15:35.715 --> 15:37.152
- should be taken to the O.R. immediately.
- Ultrasound in the ER is new.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.053
- It's not in every textbook,
- So I guess, what?

15:39.065 --> 15:41.410
- and recent studies have shown...
- ... it's a very accurate at identifying aneurysms.

15:41.426 --> 15:43.730
- You have a new toy?
- People die with delays.

15:43.747 --> 15:47.080
Valentine paper, 1993,
found that most patients

15:47.097 --> 15:49.140
without triple-A's still need surgery
for one thing or...

15:49.158 --> 15:53.002
Most, not all! With severe heart failure,
surgery can be fatal.

15:53.017 --> 15:56.601
The guy's lucky all you did was
torch him. You could've killed him.

16:00.225 --> 16:05.331
Okay, um... what is your experience
in the ER with bedside ultrasound?

16:05.348 --> 16:07.260
Well, it's been going on
for a few years now.

16:07.335 --> 16:08.550
He's cute.

16:08.945 --> 16:11.511
- But I hear he lives with somebody.
- Really?

16:11.738 --> 16:13.320
- I think he has a kid.
- We found 95% agreement

16:13.335 --> 16:17.733
with final radiology interpretation,
no significant clinical disagreements.

16:19.248 --> 16:22.251
What about for a triple-A specifically?

16:28.726 --> 16:31.593
- I don't know, exactly.
- Well, finding a gallstone is one thing.

16:31.605 --> 16:33.620
A ruptured aneurysm quite another.

16:34.958 --> 16:38.561
Well, if we'd seen a normal aorta
with an enlarged liver, we...

16:38.575 --> 16:40.242
would've saved the guy
the risk of surgery.

16:40.247 --> 16:42.170
But you couldn't do it
in a reasonable time frame.

16:42.187 --> 16:44.262
That's because we weren't given
a reasonable time frame.

16:44.277 --> 16:46.220
Well, he was unstable,
and surgery was necessary.

16:46.235 --> 16:48.210
Lighting the guy on fire--
was that necessary, too?

16:48.227 --> 16:50.200
- The Bovie wasn't grounded.
- Whose fault was that?

16:50.207 --> 16:52.063
- Yours. - Mine?!
- You shouldn't have even been in the O.R.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.023
You were up there
being a pain in the ass.

16:54.035 --> 16:56.942
We have certain O.R. protocols
for a reason, and you interfered!

16:56.955 --> 17:00.533
Okay, that's enough, that's enough.
Thank you, Dr. Gates.

17:02.565 --> 17:05.381
I think we can all see
what the real problem is here.

17:05.738 --> 17:09.160
Providing the best care requires
communicating openly,

17:09.175 --> 17:12.060
and when we fail to do that,
lives are lost.

17:12.346 --> 17:15.069
I think that's something
we can all learn from today's M & M.

17:15.106 --> 17:17.121
Crenshaw is such a little prick.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.481
You know what?
I bet I could take him, too.

17:19.776 --> 17:23.011
Actually, I definitely think I can
take him, and you could kick his ass.

17:23.027 --> 17:24.832
- Luka?
- You're scaring me.

17:24.845 --> 17:27.593
I was looking for you.
Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier.

17:27.608 --> 17:30.493
Angela, you remember Abby.
Sure. Nice to see you back at work.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.781
Nice to be back.

17:31.807 --> 17:35.292
So, I probably should've warned you
Curtis Ames was coming in.

17:35.406 --> 17:37.450
Okay, what's all this about,
the settlement?

17:37.467 --> 17:38.972
There is no settlement.

17:39.007 --> 17:43.571
We agreed to the meeting as a show of
good faith, in case we went back to trial.

17:43.675 --> 17:46.213
But don't worry.
The appeal's never gonna happen.

17:46.226 --> 17:48.821
Ames can't even find
a lawyer to take the case.

17:48.878 --> 17:51.103
We're not settling.
It's over.

17:51.415 --> 17:53.442
- Good.
- All right, what do we got?

17:53.577 --> 17:58.442
Okay, hypotensive secondary to what looks
like a traumatic pericardial effusion.

17:59.557 --> 18:02.143
Wow, guy's got a lot of fluid
around his heart.

18:02.156 --> 18:04.192
Looks like I'm gonna do
a percardiocentesis.

18:04.198 --> 18:07.152
- BP's still dropping. 88/52.
- It's weird, I had one this morning.

18:07.158 --> 18:08.671
Okay, Malik, set me up.

18:09.478 --> 18:11.833
- How's your guy?
- Just a bloody nose.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.302
Did you say there's something wrong
with my heart?

18:14.316 --> 18:18.112
- He's awake.
- I'm Dr. Morris, attending physician.

18:19.195 --> 18:22.032
Wait a minute, it's you.
From this morning.

18:22.047 --> 18:23.673
- You know him?
- Yeah. No, no.

18:23.676 --> 18:27.301
- You were here earlier?
- No, I wasn't.

18:28.126 --> 18:29.960
- Hey, Sam?
- Yeah?

18:30.967 --> 18:33.051
He's our A.M.A. patient
from this morning, right?

18:36.177 --> 18:37.851
Yeah, the flu jerk.

18:38.145 --> 18:41.161
I don't know what you
people are talking about.

18:42.386 --> 18:44.163
I don't have the flu.

18:45.275 --> 18:49.071
I've never been here... before.

18:52.578 --> 18:54.983
Joe, hey, what's it gonna be?

18:55.348 --> 18:58.493
Good-looking Brazilian or big,
mean Russian, hmm?

18:59.005 --> 19:00.012
Joe?

19:03.316 --> 19:06.012
- Going home.
- Say "bye."

19:25.266 --> 19:30.793
We use sound to see, insert the needle into
the pericardial sac to drain the blood.

19:30.808 --> 19:35.430
You use sound to see.
That's fascinating.

19:35.765 --> 19:38.733
Just like bats and dolphins.

19:39.046 --> 19:42.362
It'll release the pressure on your heart
and make it easier for you to breathe.

19:42.447 --> 19:46.333
- And I won't feel a thing.
- Not a thing.

19:48.078 --> 19:50.552
- Can I watch?
- Yeah, sure.

19:54.895 --> 19:57.650
- Okay, cool.
- Oh, come on!

19:58.035 --> 20:01.223
This morning, bats and dolphins here
was ready to rip my head off.

20:01.238 --> 20:04.273
- What are you trying to pull, buddy?
- Why is he so angry?

20:04.275 --> 20:06.123
Sam, prep his chest
and have two of versed ready.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.883
Mr. Payton, we'll be right back.
Morris, can we talk?

20:10.237 --> 20:11.240
Morris!

20:14.205 --> 20:15.811
I don't know what
this whack job's game is.

20:15.825 --> 20:18.160
His game is he's probably a little kooky
from a blow to his head.

20:18.177 --> 20:20.211
- He could easily be amnestic.
- He's got to be on something.

20:20.225 --> 20:22.200
- He's totally different now.
- Give the guy a break.

20:22.217 --> 20:23.433
He just got his ass kicked.

20:23.447 --> 20:25.871
He really didn't want that procedure
this morning, right?

20:25.875 --> 20:27.581
Maybe he was really
pissed off at you, Archie.

20:27.596 --> 20:29.321
It wouldn't be the first time.

20:29.818 --> 20:30.631
Now...

20:31.758 --> 20:34.541
I know this may sound
a little corny, but, um...

20:35.378 --> 20:39.203
I always catch more flies with honey,
you know what I mean?

20:43.557 --> 20:46.321
That... that's good, that's good, Ray.

20:47.127 --> 20:48.801
I li... I like that approach.

20:50.206 --> 20:52.930
You'll make a great attending
someday, my man.

20:53.007 --> 20:56.603
I'm sorry.
I know my wallet's in here somewhere.

20:58.878 --> 21:00.493
- Damn it.
- I got that.

21:00.505 --> 21:03.900
- And, uh, can I get a Polish, please?
- No, no. That's okay.

21:04.026 --> 21:05.421
Don't worry about it. I insist, really.

21:05.585 --> 21:07.151
It's not necessary. Really.

21:07.526 --> 21:09.780
When you got your hands full,
it's the least I can do.

21:10.447 --> 21:11.691
It's just a hot dog.

21:12.945 --> 21:17.331
My mom always taught me, random acts of
kindness make the world a better place.

21:18.076 --> 21:20.671
Well, I can't argue with that.
Thank you.

21:21.486 --> 21:24.471
- What is he, about six months?
- Five and a half.

21:25.005 --> 21:26.162
He's really cute.

21:26.175 --> 21:28.220
He's got a set of pipes on him
you wouldn't believe.

21:28.418 --> 21:31.972
Are you driving your mom crazy?
Nah. Nah.

21:38.008 --> 21:40.052
Here's your frog. Ribbit.

21:40.585 --> 21:43.070
This yours? There you go.

21:46.765 --> 21:48.993
- Excuse me, Dr. Weaver.
- Yeah?

21:49.178 --> 21:53.511
Something is weighing on my heart
and I just can't take it anymore.

21:53.716 --> 21:55.001
What's the problem?

21:55.476 --> 21:58.990
I gave Oscar Batista Lovastatin samples.

21:59.406 --> 22:01.083
That sweet, hard working man--

22:01.096 --> 22:03.151
I was afraid that he would stop
taking his pills

22:03.166 --> 22:05.732
and then he would come back here
with a heart attack or a stroke...

22:05.875 --> 22:06.891
That precious little boy...

22:06.908 --> 22:09.350
it reminded me how moved I was
by your television piece.

22:09.367 --> 22:11.881
I just thought some tiny act
of kindness might really be...

22:11.906 --> 22:14.033
Okay, stop!

22:16.236 --> 22:17.611
You did a good thing.

22:18.276 --> 22:19.273
Really.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.671
There might be hope for you, Hope.

22:30.667 --> 22:33.771
You told me those drug samples were
for Dr. Weaver's patient.

22:34.767 --> 22:38.920
Well, they were... technically.

22:38.936 --> 22:41.041
Well, technically, you lied to me.

22:41.057 --> 22:42.793
There are rules
for breaking the rules, rookie,

22:42.796 --> 22:46.503
and rule number one is that you never
ever lie to the nurses, you got me?

22:46.955 --> 22:48.573
I'm so sorry.

22:49.857 --> 22:51.250
Fell off a ladder at work.

22:51.266 --> 22:54.923
Dude wasn't paying attention, so I had to pay the price.

22:54.936 --> 22:57.242
Oh, sounds like a dangerous job.

22:57.875 --> 23:00.143
Nah-- carpenter.

23:00.986 --> 23:03.710
It's tough doing it with one arm, though.

23:03.726 --> 23:05.722
Well, sprains heal pretty quickly.

23:06.578 --> 23:09.202
Yeah, that's what they told me
at the hospital.

23:10.578 --> 23:13.611
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm headed for the red line.

23:13.628 --> 23:15.202
Oh, I'm headed this way.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.003
Well...

23:19.907 --> 23:22.623
- nice to meet you.
- You, too. Thank you for the hot dog.

23:22.637 --> 23:23.750
It's my pleasure.

23:24.508 --> 23:25.910
I'll catch you later, Joe.

23:41.945 --> 23:44.461
Hey, uh, any messages for me yet, Frank?

23:44.467 --> 23:48.180
No, Morris! The TV producer lady
has not called back yet.

23:48.185 --> 23:49.602
And if you ask me that one more time,

23:49.617 --> 23:52.720
I'm gonna slap you so hard, you'll turn
brunette. Have you got it?

23:52.875 --> 23:54.453
Position's been filled.

23:55.176 --> 23:58.061
- What position?
- And stop calling the television station.

23:58.075 --> 24:00.750
- I'm getting complaints.
- Oh, that... oh, that position, right.

24:00.765 --> 24:03.820
They filled it, huh?
Who'd they... who'd the find so fast?

24:03.838 --> 24:05.281
- Me.
- You?

24:05.295 --> 24:08.071
- I thought you turned it down.
- Yeah, well I changed my mind.

24:08.137 --> 24:12.101
Figured it was about time someone put
something worthwhile on television.

24:13.488 --> 24:15.543
So, Smitty, how long you had the rash?

24:15.666 --> 24:18.700
- About two weeks now.
- Got any food allergies?

24:18.807 --> 24:19.832
No.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.373
- You on any medications?
- Just my blood pressure pills.

24:22.386 --> 24:23.813
All right, come on, have a seat.

24:25.386 --> 24:26.690
What kind of pills?

24:29.466 --> 24:30.500
All right.

24:31.578 --> 24:35.011
Oh, you see, that's the problem.
Rash is a common reaction to enalopril.

24:35.025 --> 24:36.280
Who prescribed these for you?

24:36.288 --> 24:38.761
Doc up at the clinic put me on it
'bout ten years ago.

24:38.777 --> 24:41.610
- This and something else.
- Ten years ago?

24:42.035 --> 24:43.410
Who gave you these?

24:43.416 --> 24:45.453
See, my man T-Bone-- you know T...

24:45.465 --> 24:49.142
Smitty, you can't take other people's
medications, man. It's not safe.

24:49.157 --> 24:51.240
- Everybody does it.
- Everybody who?

24:51.256 --> 24:55.171
Up at First Mission Baptist, Pastor Watkins
does a drug exchange program.

24:55.545 --> 24:58.191
You should come up there sometime.
Man gives a powerful sermon...

24:58.207 --> 25:01.121
Okay, hold on, hold on.
He does a drug exchange program?

25:01.135 --> 25:03.943
Hell, yeah.
I ain't got insurance.

25:04.106 --> 25:05.882
You know how much this stuff costs?

25:10.675 --> 25:13.160
You can't possibly think ultrasound
was contraindicated.

25:13.168 --> 25:15.060
I do if it can't be done immediately.

25:15.077 --> 25:16.721
You could've told me that before the M&M.

25:16.735 --> 25:18.980
Well, I didn't realize I had to point
out the totally obvious.

25:18.997 --> 25:22.080
- I can't... I can't win with you.
- Well, finally we agree on something.

25:22.095 --> 25:23.320
- Finally. Yes.
- Yes.

25:23.336 --> 25:24.780
You don't have to take the piss out
on me, you know.

25:24.785 --> 25:26.420
- The piss? Piss?
- Yes. Yes.

25:26.525 --> 25:30.102
Yep, you got a nice fluid pocket.
This is gonna be a snap.

25:30.117 --> 25:32.270
Sam, draw up some one percent lido.

25:35.588 --> 25:40.991
Okay, before I start, just a few things.
Main risks here, bleeding and infection.

25:41.036 --> 25:43.481
Y-You-You could infect my heart?

25:43.836 --> 25:47.343
- Come on, let's not make this any harder.
- Calm down and let them work.

25:47.375 --> 25:48.311
No!

25:49.275 --> 25:53.623
What about bleeding?
I have trepidation about bleeding.

25:53.636 --> 25:56.650
Well, it's only a minor risk 'cause
we're using such a small needle.

25:57.558 --> 26:00.571
Well, not so small, but... thin.

26:00.967 --> 26:04.322
And you'll be all numbed up,
so you won't feel a thing.

26:05.976 --> 26:08.382
Okeydokey.
Let's do this.

26:14.277 --> 26:16.242
Stop it! Get that thing away
from me, you clown!

26:16.436 --> 26:20.203
- I told you, I don't want that!
- You agreed to the procedure, Mr. Payton.

26:20.217 --> 26:22.142
- Screw that!
- Mr. Payton...

26:22.156 --> 26:25.563
And stop calling me that.
My name's Clyde Sandberg.

26:25.576 --> 26:28.861
You people got short-term
memory loss or something?!

26:29.575 --> 26:30.452
Huh?!

26:32.376 --> 26:34.810
- You ambushed me.
- You were spewing absurdities.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.720
- Do you not like me or something?
- I think you're a wanker.

26:36.737 --> 26:38.701
- A wanker?
- You're cocky, you're arrogant...

26:38.715 --> 26:39.833
And you're not as smooth

26:39.838 --> 26:41.211
- as you think you are.
- Oh, really, I'm not?

26:41.227 --> 26:43.461
- No, you're not.
- I never said I was.

26:53.027 --> 26:57.400
You know, I called you the other night,
and a woman answered.

26:57.427 --> 26:59.481
Yeah, I can explain that.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.090
Now would be a good time.

27:17.516 --> 27:20.722
Here! Here! Bats and dolphins guy,
I figured it out.

27:22.296 --> 27:23.892
- It's DID.
- What?

27:24.077 --> 27:26.330
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

27:26.477 --> 27:28.513
Multiple personalities.
You're kidding me.

27:28.526 --> 27:30.533
- Psych make that diagnosis?
- No, I paged them three times.

27:30.548 --> 27:32.611
- They haven't come down yet.
- This is based off of what,

27:32.627 --> 27:36.413
- your extensive psychiatric expertise?
- No, he's a classic presentation--

27:36.425 --> 27:39.021
old abuse injuries,
keeps changing his name.

27:39.038 --> 27:41.480
Okay, maybe it's you that needs
the psych evaluation.

27:41.496 --> 27:44.031
No, I'm serious, Ray.
We have to double doctor this guy.

27:44.075 --> 27:47.450
Listen, he keeps refusing treatment,
that effusion will kill him.

27:47.466 --> 27:48.972
And who knows how long psych will take?

27:48.978 --> 27:51.481
I mean, by the time their resident sees
him, they present to the attending,

27:51.496 --> 27:53.220
they have their stupid meeting,
it could be hours.

27:53.238 --> 27:56.701
Double doctoring-- that's a pretty big deal.
Can't we just treat with

27:56.727 --> 27:59.133
- NSAIDS and steroids?
- He's refusing vital treatment.

27:59.146 --> 28:00.932
And that, my friend, is grounds
for a double doctor.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.770
- Come on, come on, get with me here.
- What, so I'm back on the case now?

28:03.788 --> 28:04.752
Yeah.

28:05.777 --> 28:07.661
Look, I tell you what.

28:09.007 --> 28:10.152
I'll talk to him.

28:10.346 --> 28:13.810
I'll try and get some sort of read.
But maybe you should hang back.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.320
You already pissed him off enough today.

28:22.095 --> 28:25.681
So... I have a few questions for you.

28:26.157 --> 28:27.693
Can you tell me what day it is?

28:32.477 --> 28:33.730
Thursday.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.450
Month and year?

28:35.676 --> 28:39.323
You know, they got this new thing out
called a "calendar."

28:42.947 --> 28:46.961
My freakin' God-- November. 2006.

28:47.277 --> 28:50.113
- Do you know where you are?
- What is this place, Romper Room?

28:50.125 --> 28:54.202
I see "Stupid" and "Retard"
and "Jerkoff."

28:55.276 --> 28:58.163
I'm at County General Hospital.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.361
- I am not double doctoring.
- Ray, he's only going to get worse.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.521
He's hypotensive
with reduced cardiac output.

29:03.537 --> 29:05.342
Look, he already hates doctors,
especially you.

29:05.355 --> 29:07.480
Do you really want to tie him down
and stick a needle into his chest?

29:07.497 --> 29:10.221
- If it'll save his life, hell, yeah.
- I am out, Archie.

29:10.237 --> 29:13.062
Fine, I'll get somebody else.
Hey, Pratt.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.020
No, no, no, no.
Hasta-la-bye-bye.

29:15.037 --> 29:17.142
Pratt, I need you to sign off
on a double doctor.

29:18.078 --> 29:20.573
- What you got, a foster kid or something?
- No, he's a competent adult.

29:20.587 --> 29:22.800
He's got a pericardial effusion
and doesn't want treatment.

29:22.818 --> 29:25.302
Morris wants to get medieval
on the guy because he thinks...

29:25.316 --> 29:27.093
I think he's DID.

29:27.108 --> 29:30.112
- Multiple personalities.
- Yeah, I know what it is. What did psych say?

29:30.127 --> 29:31.250
They're MIA.

29:31.266 --> 29:33.190
Morris you do know that
multiple personality syndrome...

29:33.208 --> 29:35.072
Dissociative Identity Disorder,
they changed it.

29:35.088 --> 29:37.171
Yeah, whatever.
Some docs don't even think it exists.

29:37.187 --> 29:39.060
There's a ton of literature to support it.

29:39.076 --> 29:41.752
- Okay, so how are his vitals?
- Systolic's holding in the 90's.

29:41.766 --> 29:43.740
- And mental status?
- Alert and oriented.

29:43.757 --> 29:46.492
- Tox screen and CT?
- Clear.

29:47.567 --> 29:50.322
You got to treat him conservatively.
Wait for psych, it's their call.

29:52.077 --> 29:54.553
Pratt, you want me to be more thorough.
That's what I'm doing.

29:54.777 --> 29:57.151
Pratt, listen to me
for one second, please.

29:57.166 --> 30:00.432
If a patient presents within a week of
surgery, it's considered a bounce-back.

30:00.456 --> 30:02.323
Make sure all bounce-backs are
logged in the follow-up book.

30:02.337 --> 30:03.951
Hey, can I speak to you for a second?

30:03.966 --> 30:06.793
We're in seroma. Removing
the staples and packing the dermis.

30:06.795 --> 30:10.111
Uh, wasn't actually talking to you.

30:12.777 --> 30:16.630
Um, okay. Go ahead.
I'll just get started.

30:18.038 --> 30:21.001
- So how's surgery treating you?
- Like a stepchild.

30:21.406 --> 30:22.921
Radiology's looking better every day.

30:22.938 --> 30:26.022
It'll be over soon enough.
I hated my surgical rotation.

30:26.978 --> 30:29.902
So, um, do you like hockey?

30:31.005 --> 30:32.961
Tonsil or ice?

30:34.278 --> 30:36.200
Uh, ice.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.862
Mm, too bad.

30:40.775 --> 30:42.820
But, yeah, I'll settle for a Hawks game.

30:52.028 --> 30:54.030
He still refusing treatment?

30:55.005 --> 30:59.933
Last BP was 84 over 50,
and he's developed pulsus paradoxus.

31:02.788 --> 31:04.242
Found his old file.

31:06.195 --> 31:09.161
Willis Payton is his real name.

31:09.806 --> 31:12.561
Probably be the "host" personality.

31:12.676 --> 31:15.393
His Clyde character must be
one of his "alters".

31:16.708 --> 31:19.532
He was here a bunch of times
between '88 and '96.

31:19.866 --> 31:23.521
Foster kid, abuse related injuries--
some bad ones, too.

31:25.175 --> 31:27.812
It's a classic DID history.

31:28.616 --> 31:30.411
Psych's still a no show?

31:37.276 --> 31:39.953
I know everybody down here
thinks I'm a joke.

31:43.706 --> 31:48.100
If Pratt said DID, he'd be a genius.

31:50.456 --> 31:51.601
But I...

31:51.907 --> 31:54.371
I know that I'm right about this.

31:57.338 --> 32:00.182
And all I can do is suck on it
and watch this guy die.

32:04.178 --> 32:05.582
You did what you could.

32:07.706 --> 32:10.073
And you're not a joke, Archie.

32:10.737 --> 32:12.003
You're an attending.

32:17.466 --> 32:18.590
Thank you.

32:26.937 --> 32:30.752
Was a time when that mountain
seemed so high,

32:30.778 --> 32:33.322
like it stretched up to
the Pearly Gates themselves.

32:35.007 --> 32:37.251
Promised land seemed like an idea.

32:38.026 --> 32:40.630
Like no matter how hard we worked,

32:41.307 --> 32:44.171
it was only sand between our fingers.

32:44.877 --> 32:46.510
But we're still here.

32:47.225 --> 32:50.860
Proud and strong, Lord have mercy,
we're still here.

32:50.878 --> 32:53.251
But we got a whole lot of work to do,

32:53.428 --> 32:57.212
because the more things change,
the more they stay the same.

32:57.877 --> 32:59.462
Young-Young brother in the back.

33:00.227 --> 33:02.661
You're new.
Stand up and introduce yourself.

33:04.407 --> 33:05.670
No, no, you!

33:08.897 --> 33:12.122
- Evening, everyone, I'm Greg Pratt.
- Welcome, Brother Pratt.

33:12.137 --> 33:13.162
Come on up front.

33:13.175 --> 33:15.550
Nice to see young folk in
the evening service, isn't it?

33:18.138 --> 33:19.703
Heart's getting worse, you know.

33:21.575 --> 33:25.482
Here we go again. No!
You need me to spell it?

33:25.497 --> 33:29.623
If you keep refusing treatment,
it's gonna go down one of two ways:

33:30.407 --> 33:32.131
one, the doctors are going
to come in here,

33:32.137 --> 33:35.882
- tie you down, and do the procedure.
- They can't touch me, I got rights.

33:35.897 --> 33:39.780
Or two, we get to watch you die.

33:41.636 --> 33:42.980
Fun for you.

33:44.077 --> 33:45.781
There's a third option.

33:46.146 --> 33:50.170
You give consent, we fix your heart,
and you go home.

33:51.875 --> 33:53.423
All we want to do is help.

33:53.435 --> 33:56.501
Yeah, you've been loads of help so far.

34:04.846 --> 34:08.300
- I know you're scared.
- No, I ain't scared of nothing!

34:12.005 --> 34:15.152
I know you've been hurt.
A lot.

34:17.685 --> 34:19.591
But you are safe here.

34:20.806 --> 34:26.063
I know you don't want to trust us,
but you can. I promise.

34:46.678 --> 34:48.150
Was, um...

34:50.318 --> 34:51.782
was-was...

34:53.275 --> 34:54.752
was I sleeping?

34:56.726 --> 34:57.782
No.

34:59.156 --> 35:00.942
I lost time.

35:03.566 --> 35:05.423
I lost time again.

35:08.866 --> 35:09.951
Willis?

35:12.335 --> 35:13.382
Yeah?

35:14.558 --> 35:17.141
Clyde's been giving us a hard time.

35:20.997 --> 35:25.792
- I... I thought he was gone.
- You know about Clyde?

35:26.207 --> 35:27.460
Yeah.

35:28.476 --> 35:31.210
My friends told me about him.

35:32.368 --> 35:34.092
He's very negative.

35:37.466 --> 35:40.072
Well, Clyde doesn't want us help you.

35:40.765 --> 35:46.512
So all we could do was give you some
medicine, but that's not working too well.

35:47.028 --> 35:54.403
Um, well... can you, can you still fix me?

35:55.117 --> 35:57.413
Willis, I need Clyde's permission.

35:57.995 --> 36:01.063
I can't make him do anything.
I can't.

36:01.077 --> 36:04.310
We can't start and stop again.
We're running out of time.

36:04.326 --> 36:06.862
No. No, no, no.

36:07.475 --> 36:08.983
No.

36:10.806 --> 36:14.901
Willis! Damn it, let me talk
to Clyde right now!

36:14.917 --> 36:17.971
Do not make me hurt you!
Let me talk to Clyde!

36:17.986 --> 36:20.770
How many times I got to tell you
to get off me, bitch?

36:20.785 --> 36:22.871
Huh, how many times?! Huh?!

36:26.385 --> 36:27.760
I saw Willis.

36:28.178 --> 36:30.912
- He's letting us do the procedure.
- He's a pansy!

36:31.877 --> 36:35.553
Yeah, well, he's brave enough to let us
stick a needle in his heart.

36:35.565 --> 36:38.812
Piss off, bitch.

36:39.707 --> 36:40.711
Fine.

36:40.957 --> 36:43.883
You be a tough guy all the way
to your funeral. I'm done.

36:46.967 --> 36:48.051
Hey!

36:52.185 --> 36:54.810
You stick my heart, that means
I get out of here, right?

36:55.405 --> 36:56.320
Yep.

36:58.725 --> 36:59.812
Do it.

36:59.908 --> 37:02.423
I told you I ain't scared of nothing.

37:04.295 --> 37:08.342
The drug exchange program is only
for people who have prescriptions

37:08.797 --> 37:10.573
 but can't afford the drugs.

37:10.588 --> 37:13.743
Smitty's prescription was ten years old.
And he had Enalopril.

37:13.757 --> 37:18.070
Enalopril is not the first drug of choice
for black folks with high blood pressure.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.132
I suggest that you start
an exercise program.

37:21.145 --> 37:25.320
Get your congregation to stop eating salt
and fried foods and start exercising.

37:25.336 --> 37:27.930
Trust me, you'll do
a whole lot more good.

37:28.225 --> 37:30.573
We don't just help people
with high blood pressure.

37:30.587 --> 37:33.243
We have diabetics, asthmatics,
you name it.

37:33.255 --> 37:37.992
Look, what you're doing is dangerous,
okay, not to mention illegal.

37:40.808 --> 37:43.363
I have an obligation
to this community, Dr. Pratt.

37:43.778 --> 37:47.712
These people are shackled by a system
over which they have no control.

37:47.887 --> 37:51.233
The one thing I will not do is nothing.

37:52.255 --> 37:55.540
Excuse me, Dr. Morris, can I ask
your advice on something?

37:55.905 --> 38:01.240
I lied to Samantha about something
and now she's really steamed.

38:01.256 --> 38:05.072
Ooh, bad move. Piss one nurse off,
piss 'em all off, like the mafia.

38:05.276 --> 38:08.301
You know, whenever I'm in
a precarious situation,

38:08.307 --> 38:11.401
I always ask myself,
"What would Jesus do?"

38:11.707 --> 38:12.821
Right.

38:13.165 --> 38:17.012
What would Jesus would do
if the nurses hated him?

38:17.418 --> 38:20.351
Well, he would do the right thing,
of course.

38:20.356 --> 38:24.410
That's the problem, I thought that
I was doing the right thing. I guess...

38:24.898 --> 38:28.413
- I just... I did it the wrong way.
- Hey, it's the story of my life.

38:28.426 --> 38:33.232
You know, sometimes it doesn't matter
how much we kick and scream.

38:33.527 --> 38:34.981
Even when we're right.

38:36.277 --> 38:39.753
"The prophet is without honor
in his own land."

38:40.197 --> 38:46.112
- Matthew 13:54.
- Oh, I love that one. Big Matthew fan.

38:47.418 --> 38:49.790
You have a good night, Dr. Morris.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.263
Feeling better?

39:07.407 --> 39:10.063
Drained almost half a liter of fluid
from around your heart.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.531
Your blood pressure and pulse
are back to normal.

39:12.548 --> 39:15.262
Soon as a bed opens up,
we'll get you upstairs to a room.

39:19.837 --> 39:22.702
So, you're doing great.

39:27.006 --> 39:29.162
You got my glasses?

39:30.278 --> 39:32.621
Uh... let me check, yeah.

39:50.547 --> 39:53.410
- That kid gonna be okay?
- Who?

39:55.868 --> 39:59.563
Yeah, I'm sure he is.
Looks like he's leaving.

40:02.767 --> 40:05.122
He was racing Hot Wheels.

40:07.575 --> 40:10.521
His mom, she was mean.

40:32.615 --> 40:33.812
Willis?

40:37.476 --> 40:39.480
My name is Andre.

40:44.376 --> 40:46.493
I like Hot Wheels.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.031
I wish his mom wasn't so mean.

40:55.108 --> 40:57.360
Hey, hey... 

41:00.597 --> 41:04.652
don't tell my dad I'm here, okay?
He can be pretty mean, too.

41:10.647 --> 41:14.113
Your secret's safe with me. Okay?

41:18.595 --> 41:20.823
It's kind of dark in here.

41:25.887 --> 41:27.970
You're not gonna leave, are you?

41:29.467 --> 41:30.803
No.

41:33.207 --> 41:36.832
No way, buddy, no.
I'm here all night.

41:38.706 --> 41:40.302
That's good.

41:54.705 --> 41:58.961
So, what kind of Hot Wheels you got?

41:59.847 --> 42:02.533
All kinds. I collect 'em.

42:02.548 --> 42:03.912
Yeah?

42:04.237 --> 42:06.241
I used to collect them, too.

42:06.905 --> 42:08.603
What kind you got?

42:09.707 --> 42:13.273
I used to have a '57 Chevy.

42:13.696 --> 42:15.681
I got that one.

42:16.286 --> 42:18.912
- Shelby Cobra.
- Got it.

42:19.285 --> 42:24.910
Okay, all right... '65 Mustang Fastback.

42:25.397 --> 42:27.903
- I got two.
- You got two?

42:27.915 --> 42:29.791
- Yeah.
- Wow.

42:31.778 --> 42:34.730
I used to have three,
but I gave one to my friend.

42:34.748 --> 42:38.263
Well, you'll have to give one to me,
'cause I don't think I have mine anymore.
