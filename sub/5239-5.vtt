00:04.895 --> 00:06.261
Previously on Blunt Talk.

00:06.263 --> 00:08.563
I think I'll go to the gambling meeting.

00:08.598 --> 00:10.598
Good idea. You love to gamble.

00:10.650 --> 00:13.101
- Are those real?
- Of course they are.

00:13.103 --> 00:15.937
Mr. Blunt. Stay and have a cup of coffee.

00:15.939 --> 00:18.106
Mr. Daniel Craig and Mr. Jeffrey Katzenberg

00:18.108 --> 00:20.441
are just finishing their dessert.

00:20.443 --> 00:22.110
I know we've only just met, Gisele,

00:22.162 --> 00:24.746
but thank you for being kind to me.

00:24.781 --> 00:26.614
You know where my keys are?

00:26.616 --> 00:29.617
You can remember poetry,
but you lose your keys.

00:29.669 --> 00:31.836
- I guess so.
- Jim, open your door.

00:31.872 --> 00:33.588
He's a hoarder.

00:33.623 --> 00:36.124
I'm gonna pay for you to see my analyst.

00:36.176 --> 00:38.259
This freakish storm is the perfect backdrop

00:38.295 --> 00:41.429
for talking about what we're
doing to the environment.

00:41.464 --> 00:42.847
Well, there's a family in LA,

00:42.883 --> 00:44.515
I mean, they're hoping
that by having no impact

00:44.551 --> 00:45.550
they'll have an impact.

00:45.602 --> 00:47.969
Yes, that's what I need.

00:47.971 --> 00:51.105
A shift in consciousness
at the grassroots level.

00:51.141 --> 00:53.308
Celia, that is a message I can work with.

01:12.162 --> 01:13.328
Ooh.

01:13.380 --> 01:16.080
10 strikes to the abdomen today, sir.

01:16.132 --> 01:18.583
- Very good.
- Thank you, Harry.

01:20.003 --> 01:23.721
But why am I keeping

01:23.757 --> 01:26.057
my organism so pristine, Harry?

01:26.092 --> 01:29.177
I mean, what's the
point of all this fitness

01:29.229 --> 01:32.263
if I don't put it to good use erotically?

01:32.315 --> 01:34.599
- Preparedness, Major.
- Check the log.

01:34.651 --> 01:38.436
When was the last time that
I needed to be prepared?

01:39.689 --> 01:41.940
Suffocation nightmares,

01:41.992 --> 01:44.859
books read, famous friends,

01:44.861 --> 01:47.495
strange and beautiful coincidences,

01:47.530 --> 01:49.197
healthy bowels.

01:49.199 --> 01:50.865
Why don't you alphabetize the log, Harry?

01:50.917 --> 01:52.166
I've told you this more than once.

01:52.202 --> 01:55.453
The log is my domain, Major.

01:55.505 --> 01:58.840
Oh, here we are, love making.

01:58.875 --> 02:01.676
It's been seven months, sir,

02:01.711 --> 02:03.845
since you had proper intercourse.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.548
And with whom did I have proper
intercourse seven months ago?

02:07.600 --> 02:09.767
Margaret, an attractive fan

02:09.803 --> 02:11.269
you met at the Gelson's Market.

02:11.304 --> 02:13.354
You just signed your divorce papers,

02:13.390 --> 02:16.357
became intoxicated, and
went shopping without me.

02:16.393 --> 02:18.142
Margaret?

02:18.194 --> 02:21.696
It's rather an alcoholic blur, Harry.

02:21.731 --> 02:23.147
Is there a phone number?

02:23.199 --> 02:25.650
Uh, yes, sir, but it's specifically notated

02:25.702 --> 02:27.035
that you're not to see her again.

02:27.070 --> 02:29.287
After making love, she wept, vomited,

02:29.322 --> 02:32.073
and you found antipsychotic
pills in her medicine cabinet.

02:32.075 --> 02:36.377
Well, so much for Margaret.

02:44.304 --> 02:47.755
You know, I just wanted to see you, Walter,

02:47.807 --> 02:49.757
and thank you

02:49.759 --> 02:52.593
for being my bottom that night.

02:52.645 --> 02:54.262
Hey...

02:54.264 --> 02:57.098
Gisele, we were only
together for a few minutes.

02:57.150 --> 02:59.600
Oh...

02:59.602 --> 03:01.652
That would have been fun.

03:01.688 --> 03:05.440
Um, I mean my emotional bottom.

03:05.442 --> 03:06.941
Ah. Getting arrested.

03:06.943 --> 03:10.028
It was truly a wake up call for me.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.415
And for me too. I am trying
to turn everything around.

03:14.451 --> 03:16.034
My life, my show,

03:16.086 --> 03:18.453
my relationship with my young son.

03:18.505 --> 03:20.755
And, uh, mere detail,

03:20.790 --> 03:22.957
but I'd like to help save the planet.

03:23.009 --> 03:26.294
Those are all amazing goals, Walter.

03:29.799 --> 03:31.933
What are your goals, Gisele?

03:31.968 --> 03:36.104
What do you want from
our shared wake up call?

03:36.139 --> 03:38.856
I'm finally gonna settle down,

03:38.892 --> 03:40.475
get out of the life.

03:40.477 --> 03:42.110
Settle down?

03:42.145 --> 03:44.896
I have someone who really loves me.

03:44.948 --> 03:47.315
- Always has.
- I see.

03:47.367 --> 03:49.317
I pushed him away for so long.

03:49.319 --> 03:52.703
I didn't think I deserved to be loved.

03:52.739 --> 03:54.872
Who's gonna love the tranny?

03:56.209 --> 03:58.826
But I want to stop wasting time.

03:58.828 --> 04:01.629
Life feels like

04:01.664 --> 04:03.915
it's just flying past me.

04:03.967 --> 04:08.002
I understand. I often feel that way.

04:08.004 --> 04:10.171
I wonder

04:10.173 --> 04:13.724
where the hell has it gone, my life?

04:13.760 --> 04:16.894
And then I think of that line

04:16.930 --> 04:18.896
from The Red Shoes.

04:18.932 --> 04:22.683
"Time rushes by, life rushes by,

04:22.685 --> 04:26.654
but the red shoes go on dancing forever."

04:30.193 --> 04:34.278
I'll see you and raise you 300,

04:34.330 --> 04:36.080
you nasty piece of work.

04:36.116 --> 04:38.616
I take my rosÃ© straight. Thank you, Teddy.

04:40.670 --> 04:41.919
Your turn, beanpole.

04:41.955 --> 04:43.421
Yes. Sorry. I'm just...

04:43.456 --> 04:46.707
just let me...

04:46.759 --> 04:48.709
I will raise you one.

04:48.711 --> 04:50.795
Okay, you know we play by Vegas rules.

04:50.847 --> 04:52.713
That white chip is worth $1,000.

04:52.765 --> 04:53.881
Oh! Drop it, girlie.

04:53.933 --> 04:55.766
You already bet.

04:55.802 --> 04:57.852
Is it possible just this
one time to start over?

04:57.887 --> 05:01.389
No do-overs. This is poker.
It's not plastic surgery.

05:01.391 --> 05:03.941
- Right, Mel?
- Screw you.

05:03.977 --> 05:05.560
Ooh.

05:09.399 --> 05:11.732
Motherfucking hell.

05:11.784 --> 05:13.985
Celia, that's you.

05:14.037 --> 05:16.037
What, I won?

05:18.074 --> 05:19.740
Where'd you find this idiot savant?

05:19.792 --> 05:21.409
The BBC.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:38.011 --> 05:39.894
Mind if I join you, Mr. Blunt?

05:39.929 --> 05:42.513
Oh, sure, Phil.

05:42.565 --> 05:44.315
Stan.

05:44.350 --> 05:45.683
I couldn't help but notice

05:45.735 --> 05:49.020
you were with quite a
stunning lady tonight.

05:49.072 --> 05:51.322
Oh, yes.

05:51.357 --> 05:55.159
But it turns out she's just a friend.

05:56.412 --> 06:00.948
I haven't had much luck
with romance lately.

06:00.950 --> 06:04.252
I understand.

06:04.287 --> 06:07.171
I haven't had sex since...

06:07.207 --> 06:09.123
the 20th century.

06:09.175 --> 06:13.177
What? Oh, my God.

06:13.213 --> 06:16.464
Phil, I'm so sorry.

06:16.466 --> 06:18.799
It's okay.

06:18.851 --> 06:21.135
It's a gentle path.

06:21.187 --> 06:23.387
No germs.

06:23.439 --> 06:26.440
No hurt feelings.

06:36.069 --> 06:38.319
I'm all in.

06:38.371 --> 06:40.288
It's getting boring
taking your money, Rosalie.

06:40.323 --> 06:42.957
So let's make it interesting.

06:42.992 --> 06:47.828
If I win, you book my client on Blunt Talk.

06:47.880 --> 06:51.165
Which client of yours is
such an unappealing fungus

06:51.167 --> 06:53.167
that you have to win a
bet to get 'em on air?

06:53.219 --> 06:54.835
Suzanne Mayview.

06:54.837 --> 06:57.672
Tomorrow night. No bumping her.

06:57.724 --> 06:59.473
Don't be ridiculous.

06:59.509 --> 07:02.393
She's a far-right publicity whore.

07:02.428 --> 07:04.979
Walter would never have her on.

07:05.014 --> 07:07.898
Sweetheart, I think I'm gonna
turn in soon. Good night, everyone.

07:07.934 --> 07:09.517
Good night, darling.

07:09.519 --> 07:12.687
Teddy, where are your pants?

07:12.689 --> 07:14.739
Oh, shit!

07:14.774 --> 07:17.074
I spilled some hot sauce,
threw the pants in the wash,

07:17.110 --> 07:18.693
then the mini quiche were burning.

07:18.745 --> 07:21.779
It's all right, Teddy. Just go to bed.

07:21.831 --> 07:23.698
I'm sorry, ladies.

07:23.700 --> 07:27.168
Aw. Is... is Teddy all right?

07:27.203 --> 07:29.670
He's fine. He's just...

07:29.706 --> 07:32.039
Losing it. Mm.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.091
I'll take the Mayview bet.

07:34.127 --> 07:35.293
Rosalie, are you sure?

07:35.345 --> 07:37.044
Cards, Diane.

07:41.184 --> 07:44.185
Yes!

07:44.220 --> 07:46.604
- Oh.
- No bumping her.

07:46.639 --> 07:49.557
This hoarding is just a symptom.

07:49.609 --> 07:53.978
Underneath the mess is always sex.

07:55.114 --> 07:56.564
So what are you,

07:56.616 --> 07:59.116
a breast man, a leg man,

07:59.152 --> 08:01.869
or an ass man?

08:01.904 --> 08:03.904
You don't have to be embarrassed, Jim.

08:03.956 --> 08:06.290
For example, Walter is a breast man.

08:06.326 --> 08:07.958
Because he never met his father,

08:07.994 --> 08:09.543
he's fixated on the nipple

08:09.579 --> 08:11.579
as his primary source of love.

08:11.631 --> 08:13.748
Should you have told me that?

08:13.800 --> 08:17.385
Uh, no, but you liked
hearing it, didn't you?

08:17.420 --> 08:19.754
So what are you?

08:19.806 --> 08:22.089
I'm a foot man.

08:22.141 --> 08:25.142
And shoes. I like shoes.

08:25.178 --> 08:27.928
Beautiful. I like the armpit.

08:27.930 --> 08:29.597
But that's another story.

08:29.649 --> 08:32.183
So what turns you on about the foot?

08:32.235 --> 08:36.236
Okay. Well, um...

08:36.272 --> 08:39.657
when I make love to a woman,

08:39.692 --> 08:42.025
although it's been a while, um,

08:42.078 --> 08:44.328
I... I start at the foot,

08:44.364 --> 08:48.783
like a tiny boy with a miniature penis.

08:48.785 --> 08:53.087
But by nursing on the foot

08:53.122 --> 08:55.172
and smelling my own saliva,

08:55.208 --> 08:57.258
I begin to...

08:57.293 --> 09:00.461
to rise up like a beast,

09:00.463 --> 09:04.632
the foot nourishing me, growing me,

09:04.634 --> 09:08.185
until I'm this full-grown man

09:08.221 --> 09:11.188
with a tusk-like phallus.

09:11.224 --> 09:12.640
It's hooked.

09:12.642 --> 09:16.644
It's pointed up at the stars, the cosmos,

09:16.696 --> 09:19.146
the great wheel in the sky.

09:19.198 --> 09:21.399
And then I take the woman,

09:21.451 --> 09:24.652
pleasing her with my
manly hook, and then...

09:24.654 --> 09:26.954
Zip your pants, Jimmy. I need you.

09:26.989 --> 09:28.956
We're in session.

09:28.991 --> 09:30.324
I don't care!

09:30.326 --> 09:33.494
You've turned my newsroom
into a psych ward.

09:33.496 --> 09:35.996
You're very aggressive.

09:36.048 --> 09:38.332
I would like to get you on the couch.

09:38.384 --> 09:40.301
I bet you would,

09:40.336 --> 09:42.720
but I know what lurks deep inside me

09:42.755 --> 09:45.639
and I'd rather leave it there.

10:00.189 --> 10:02.690
Celia!

10:02.692 --> 10:04.525
Holy shit, Rosalie.

10:04.577 --> 10:07.027
She's the Ann Coulter of the death penalty.

10:07.029 --> 10:08.496
I know, I know.

10:08.531 --> 10:09.830
Well, can't you renege?

10:09.866 --> 10:11.699
It was just a bet in a ladies poker game.

10:11.751 --> 10:14.034
Thanks for inviting me, by the way.

10:14.036 --> 10:15.586
No, I can't renege.

10:15.621 --> 10:18.506
Linda Wilcox reps everyone on the right,

10:18.541 --> 10:21.258
the far right, and the extreme right.

10:21.294 --> 10:23.677
Also some people in the center.

10:23.713 --> 10:25.796
Well, what about the zero-impact family?

10:25.848 --> 10:28.048
Walter's gonna hate bumping them.

10:29.635 --> 10:31.552
Why are Jim and Celia in
your office and not me?

10:31.554 --> 10:33.053
Because I want them here.

10:33.055 --> 10:35.639
Don't be so needy. What's going on?

10:35.691 --> 10:37.775
Just letting you know that
Walter's in the building.

10:37.810 --> 10:40.060
Good. Now close the door, please.

10:40.062 --> 10:41.645
Okay, but next time I'd like to be here

10:41.697 --> 10:44.198
when you have a meeting.

10:44.233 --> 10:47.368
I will not give this
woman a national platform.

10:47.403 --> 10:49.904
She is pro-life and pro-death.

10:49.906 --> 10:53.290
Her world view is completely muddled.

10:53.326 --> 10:55.409
Then engage her.

10:55.411 --> 10:56.877
I will not help this woman

10:56.913 --> 10:59.630
sell a book that advocates
murder and vengeance.

10:59.665 --> 11:01.382
- But, Walter...
- No, Rosalie.

11:01.417 --> 11:03.384
This is not up for discussion.

11:03.419 --> 11:05.052
I want the zero-impact family.

11:05.087 --> 11:08.138
They have the kind of message
that I need to get out.

11:08.174 --> 11:10.224
A message of change.

11:10.259 --> 11:13.260
Celia, Jim, you agree with me, don't you?

11:13.262 --> 11:16.814
I'm sorry, Walter, but we all
think you should have Mayview on.

11:16.849 --> 11:18.933
She needs to be publicly discredited.

11:18.985 --> 11:20.935
I've already put a packet together.

11:20.987 --> 11:23.437
And we'll rebook the zero-impact family

11:23.439 --> 11:24.939
right away, I promise.

11:24.941 --> 11:28.275
All three of you really
think this is the right idea?

11:28.277 --> 11:29.660
We do.

11:29.695 --> 11:32.279
You know, Anderson Cooper had Mayview on,

11:32.281 --> 11:33.781
and he didn't do well.

11:33.783 --> 11:36.450
- He didn't?
- He was too soft.

11:36.452 --> 11:38.035
You're hard.

11:46.345 --> 11:48.879
Can you just let me keep 10
back issues of The New Yorker?

11:48.931 --> 11:51.098
I swear I'll read 'em.
I'll read 'em someday.

11:51.133 --> 11:54.018
No, no, no, no. Dr. Weiss said
not to let you hold on to anything.

11:54.053 --> 11:55.886
He said it'll help you
accept your sexuality

11:55.938 --> 11:57.688
if you get rid of all this crap.

11:57.723 --> 11:59.306
He talked about my sexuality?

11:59.308 --> 12:01.559
Can you believe this woman is proposing

12:01.611 --> 12:05.029
that executed prisoners should
have their organs harvested

12:05.064 --> 12:07.147
without their consent?!

12:08.818 --> 12:10.818
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Jim, no! Stop it!

12:10.820 --> 12:13.120
- No, come on, Martin.
- Get off!

12:13.155 --> 12:14.488
No!

12:16.792 --> 12:18.826
How are the horses, Harry?

12:18.878 --> 12:20.878
I'm on one of those streaks, Celia,

12:20.913 --> 12:22.913
that makes you feel like a schoolgirl

12:22.965 --> 12:24.498
who's just had her first kiss

12:24.550 --> 12:28.168
from the handsome bad boy
who tastes like cigarettes.

12:28.220 --> 12:30.721
I understand. I'd never
played cards before,

12:30.756 --> 12:32.506
but last night I won a lot of money,

12:32.558 --> 12:34.475
and it was better than
being with my magician.

12:34.510 --> 12:35.843
How is your magician?

12:35.895 --> 12:38.512
- He disappeared.
- Magically?

12:38.514 --> 12:40.514
- No, he went back to his wife.
- Ah.

12:40.566 --> 12:43.684
And I don't know if I'm having
some sort of weird reaction,

12:43.686 --> 12:45.819
but gambling feels better than sex.

12:48.074 --> 12:50.024
Sounds like you've met the Queen of Hearts.

12:50.026 --> 12:53.527
- How much did you win?
- $5,000.

12:55.197 --> 12:57.615
Would you like to win some more?

12:57.667 --> 12:59.583
Very much.

12:59.619 --> 13:02.286
- How did this stuff end up in there?
- Aah!

13:03.706 --> 13:06.373
I don't know. My tidal system was off.

13:06.375 --> 13:09.710
Some things would swim in and not swim out.

13:09.712 --> 13:11.178
Oh, bullshit.

13:11.213 --> 13:13.714
This woman believes that victims' families

13:13.766 --> 13:18.218
should have the option of
participating in firing squads!

13:19.772 --> 13:21.388
I shouldn't have deceived Walter,

13:21.390 --> 13:22.856
but I had no choice.

13:22.892 --> 13:25.859
He can't know that I
had a lapse in judgment.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.947
Walter needs to feel that I'm strong.

13:29.982 --> 13:31.782
It frees him to be weak.

13:31.817 --> 13:34.535
Sorry. I need a little air.

13:34.570 --> 13:36.870
Why aren't you wearing glasses?

13:36.906 --> 13:40.324
You said I had nice eyes,
so I'm trying contacts.

14:00.930 --> 14:02.896
Hello, Margaret.

14:02.932 --> 14:06.016
I don't know if your
voice-mail is recording,

14:06.068 --> 14:08.402
but, uh, this is Walter.

14:08.437 --> 14:11.321
We met in Gelson's Market
about seven months ago,

14:11.357 --> 14:12.856
and I was wondering if...

14:12.908 --> 14:15.576
Goodbye. Hello, Shelly.

14:15.611 --> 14:17.494
Walter, the Adlers are here.

14:17.530 --> 14:19.496
Because they don't have cell
phones, I couldn't reach them.

14:19.532 --> 14:21.165
Oh, shit.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.416
I didn't have the heart to
tell them they're bumped.

14:22.451 --> 14:24.284
They rode their bamboo bicycles here.

14:24.286 --> 14:26.036
They had to leave their house at 3:00 a.m.

14:26.088 --> 14:28.622
They are environmental heroes,

14:28.624 --> 14:32.209
and we are bumping them for
a woman who advocates murder.

14:32.261 --> 14:34.428
I'll break the news to them myself.

14:34.463 --> 14:38.465
Okay. Just a heads-up, because they
rode their bikes almost 50 miles,

14:38.517 --> 14:42.186
they're kind of, um, stinky
and I can't shake the smell.

14:42.221 --> 14:45.355
But this helps. I love cherry.

14:45.391 --> 14:47.641
So I sniff it.

14:49.228 --> 14:52.529
Major, Celia's in the loo vomiting.

14:52.565 --> 14:55.482
I offered to drive her
home. She looks contagious.

14:55.484 --> 14:58.152
I'll take over the edit of the B
block immigration story for her.

14:58.204 --> 15:00.954
Good. Work it out with Rosalie.

15:00.990 --> 15:03.290
Harry, be a good chap. Drive Celia home.

15:03.325 --> 15:05.209
Yes, sir.

15:15.755 --> 15:17.588
Mr. Adler, I'm Walter Blunt.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.473
Oh, yes. Of course.

15:19.508 --> 15:20.674
Oh.

15:24.230 --> 15:27.181
Uh, I think two bows is enough, Mr. Adler.

15:27.233 --> 15:29.316
Please, call me Duncan. It's
so nice to finally meet you.

15:29.351 --> 15:31.351
Well, it's very nice to meet you, but I...

15:31.403 --> 15:33.187
- This is my wife Sally.
- Oh, hi, Sally.

15:33.189 --> 15:35.022
Eli, and this is KK.

15:35.024 --> 15:37.858
Hi. Oh, I like your chalkboards.

15:37.910 --> 15:39.860
I must get one of those for my young son.

15:39.912 --> 15:42.279
If you do, let us know.
We make our own chalk.

15:42.331 --> 15:43.947
We also do quite a bit of pickling.

15:43.999 --> 15:46.583
And, uh, we use our own waste as manure.

15:46.619 --> 15:48.919
Well, that's wonderful, but there
is something that I really need...

15:48.954 --> 15:50.370
Oh, oh, whoa.

15:50.422 --> 15:53.173
These get lodged in the
blowholes of dolphins.

15:53.209 --> 15:55.042
Use it, and then hold onto it forever.

15:55.094 --> 15:57.377
Oh, God. I will. Yes, thank you so much.

15:57.379 --> 15:58.512
Uh, but...

15:58.547 --> 16:00.380
There is something we need to talk...

16:00.432 --> 16:02.432
Yes, of course. There's
not a moment to waste.

16:02.468 --> 16:04.184
We're running out of time
to reverse what's happening.

16:04.220 --> 16:05.886
You're right. It's frightening, but...

16:05.938 --> 16:07.221
I mean literally running out of time.

16:07.273 --> 16:09.439
According to German
environmental scientists...

16:09.475 --> 16:11.558
the Germans are the best. They're
still making up for the Holocaust.

16:11.610 --> 16:15.062
Global warming is causing the
planet to rotate more quickly.

16:15.064 --> 16:17.648
You see, time itself is speeding up.

16:17.700 --> 16:21.151
Oh, you know, those Germans
could be onto something.

16:21.203 --> 16:23.871
At least once a day, I think of this line

16:23.906 --> 16:25.239
from the film The Red Shoes.

16:25.291 --> 16:29.376
"Time rushes by, life rushes by, but..."

16:29.411 --> 16:33.630
"But the red shoes go on dancing forever."

16:33.666 --> 16:37.417
Oh, my God. You also know
The Red Shoes by heart.

16:37.469 --> 16:39.553
It's one of my all-time favorite movies.

16:39.588 --> 16:41.672
Back when I was still able to watch movies.

16:41.724 --> 16:43.640
Mr. Adler, do you believe

16:43.676 --> 16:46.810
in strange and beautiful coincidences?

16:46.846 --> 16:49.763
Mr. Blunt, I was just about to
ask you that very same question.

16:49.765 --> 16:51.765
Oh, nice.

16:51.767 --> 16:53.183
Stay right here.

16:56.071 --> 16:57.654
Walter Blunt.

16:57.690 --> 17:00.274
Good. Good.

17:03.946 --> 17:06.079
- Ow.
- You okay?

17:06.115 --> 17:07.998
No. Ow.

17:08.032 --> 17:10.200
- Okay, oh, oh.
- Ow.

17:10.252 --> 17:12.169
- Here, do you want to sit down?
- Ow!

17:13.505 --> 17:16.290
Sorry, but I am un-bumping
the zero-impact family.

17:16.342 --> 17:19.126
Their message is too urgent
and they are delightful.

17:19.127 --> 17:20.711
You can't.

17:20.762 --> 17:23.763
Suzanne Mayview's
already in her green room.

17:23.799 --> 17:25.632
Then I'll bump her myself.

17:25.634 --> 17:28.352
Walter, Linda Wilcox

17:28.387 --> 17:31.138
is a very powerful publicist.

17:31.190 --> 17:34.308
I don't give a shit about Linda Wilcox.

17:34.310 --> 17:36.226
My concern is with the planet!

17:44.036 --> 17:47.321
That is so embarrassing.

17:47.323 --> 17:50.490
But that flush was for a tinkle. I swear.

17:50.542 --> 17:53.961
Do you Brits classify it that
way? Number one, number two.

17:53.996 --> 17:56.163
We provide no classification

17:56.215 --> 17:58.582
- except denial of the act.
- I see.

17:58.634 --> 18:02.002
Well, thank you for saying
hello before our chat.

18:02.054 --> 18:03.670
- I'm Suzanne.
- Yes, I know.

18:03.722 --> 18:05.589
And there is something we have to discuss.

18:05.641 --> 18:07.507
I know we are on different
sides of the aisle,

18:07.559 --> 18:10.761
but I just wanted to put it
out there right away that...

18:10.813 --> 18:13.263
I'm a big fan.

18:13.315 --> 18:16.350
Oh, my God.

18:16.402 --> 18:19.820
Where did you find this?

18:19.855 --> 18:21.438
A bookseller in London.

18:21.490 --> 18:24.858
There were only 1,000 copies printed.

18:24.860 --> 18:26.860
In 1984.

18:26.862 --> 18:28.495
I know. They're very rare.

18:28.530 --> 18:32.332
- I loved it.
- Thank you.

18:38.457 --> 18:40.424
"As my mother aged,

18:40.459 --> 18:43.460
"my love for her seemed to
be picking up in velocity,

18:43.512 --> 18:46.880
"each moment with her more
precious than the next.

18:46.932 --> 18:50.600
"My greatest regret is that she
passed while I was in the Falklands

18:50.636 --> 18:53.470
"and I was unable to say goodbye.

18:53.522 --> 18:57.024
Unable to tell her one
more time that I loved her."

18:58.978 --> 19:00.894
Will you sign it for me?

19:00.896 --> 19:03.030
I'm very touched.

19:03.065 --> 19:05.065
Of course I'll sign it.

19:06.869 --> 19:08.118
Thank you.

19:08.153 --> 19:10.570
It's "Suzanne" with a Z?

19:10.572 --> 19:14.658
You can sign it to "Snax." With an X.

19:14.710 --> 19:17.127
That's what all my friends call me.

19:17.162 --> 19:19.246
And am I counted among them?

19:19.248 --> 19:22.916
I would like to think so.

19:24.253 --> 19:25.969
Are those red shoes?

19:29.425 --> 19:30.974
This is a high-stakes game.

19:31.010 --> 19:33.560
A group of crooked domestics. Tough bunch.

19:33.595 --> 19:35.512
They have a connection
with a liquor distributor

19:35.564 --> 19:37.097
because of all the home deliveries.

19:37.099 --> 19:38.732
Are you a crooked domestic, Harry?

19:38.767 --> 19:40.817
No. I have a weakness for gambling.

19:40.853 --> 19:42.769
I never thought of it that way before,

19:42.821 --> 19:45.155
but I went to a Gambler's
Anonymous meeting.

19:45.190 --> 19:46.440
It bollocks'd up my thinking.

19:49.361 --> 19:51.194
Special knock.

19:51.246 --> 19:52.829
So are we bad, Harry?

19:52.865 --> 19:54.998
We're lying to Walter, me
skipping out on my work?

19:55.034 --> 19:58.368
Well, in this moment,
we are bad. I admit it.

19:58.420 --> 20:01.705
But what good has it ever done
for people to judge themselves?

20:01.757 --> 20:04.291
So that they can exert some self-control?

20:04.293 --> 20:06.343
Oh, yeah. No, you're right.

20:06.378 --> 20:09.596
- Should we turn back?
- Well...

20:13.719 --> 20:16.219
You're late. We're starting.

20:16.271 --> 20:18.055
Larry King's pool guy.

20:24.863 --> 20:27.314
See, it's all gonna be all right.

20:27.366 --> 20:28.648
Everyone's happy.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.367
Yeah, except for the Adlers.

20:30.402 --> 20:32.369
The father cried when I bumped them.

20:32.404 --> 20:36.873
Good evening. This is Blunt
Talk, and I am Walter Blunt.

20:36.909 --> 20:40.494
We begin tonight's program
with Suzanne Mayview,

20:43.332 --> 20:45.999
Why America Needs the Death Penalty.

20:46.051 --> 20:48.969
Welcome to Blunt Talk. We're
happy to have you on, Suzanne.

20:49.004 --> 20:50.387
Thank you, Walter.

20:53.675 --> 20:56.510
This is so exciting. It
reminds me of boarding school.

20:56.512 --> 20:59.813
After lights out, we used to play
this game called French Honeymoon.

20:59.848 --> 21:02.232
Quit your small-talk. I'm not your friend.

21:04.269 --> 21:05.986
I call.

21:12.411 --> 21:14.194
So... so that beats a pair?

21:14.246 --> 21:15.695
Yeah.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.082
No, it's fine. I'm gonna win it all back.

21:19.118 --> 21:20.867
I've got this.

21:20.919 --> 21:24.504
So four of a kind. So what's a full house?

21:24.540 --> 21:27.257
The death penalty is undeniably popular.

21:27.292 --> 21:29.459
32 out of 50 states have it.

21:29.511 --> 21:33.013
62% of Americans want it.

21:33.048 --> 21:35.465
- Do you know who James Surowiecki is?
- I do.

21:35.517 --> 21:37.217
He writes for The New Yorker.

21:37.219 --> 21:40.220
Well, he has done some fascinating
research on the wisdom of crowds.

21:40.222 --> 21:42.939
Shit. I bet I just threw away that issue.

21:42.975 --> 21:45.775
The wisdom of crowds gave us McCarthyism.

21:45.811 --> 21:47.811
Time to bury her, Walter.

21:47.863 --> 21:49.729
Well, that is a controversial choice,

21:49.731 --> 21:51.531
invoking the wisdom of crowds.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.283
And what I do not understand...

21:53.318 --> 21:56.036
Well, let me try to make
it a little easier for you.

21:56.071 --> 21:57.487
If you like.

21:57.539 --> 21:58.872
Why's he being so fucking civil?

21:58.907 --> 22:01.575
Does he look weird? Like too friendly?

22:01.577 --> 22:03.910
You look weird. Why are
you squinting like that?

22:03.912 --> 22:05.545
I lost a contact lens.

22:05.581 --> 22:07.747
If a criminal were to break into your house

22:07.749 --> 22:10.834
and rape and murder your loved one...

22:10.886 --> 22:13.386
wouldn't you want capital
punishment for that person?

22:13.422 --> 22:15.755
She's going for the most
tired hypothetical of them all.

22:15.807 --> 22:19.176
An eye for an eye is a philosophy

22:19.228 --> 22:20.844
millennia out of date.

22:20.896 --> 22:24.314
But let us consider your scenario

22:24.349 --> 22:26.816
and what punishment actually achieves.

22:26.852 --> 22:29.236
Consider? Cut to commercial!

22:29.271 --> 22:31.154
Jesus Christ!

22:31.190 --> 22:34.524
Uh, but right now, I'm
sorry. We have to take a break

22:34.576 --> 22:35.992
and we will be right back.

22:36.028 --> 22:37.861
So when, uh, do you leave for...

22:37.913 --> 22:40.030
what is it... Oklahoma City?

22:40.082 --> 22:42.449
- Mm, um, tomorrow.
- Walter, quick word.

22:42.501 --> 22:45.619
Oh. Excuse me.

22:45.621 --> 22:47.003
Yes? What is it?

22:47.039 --> 22:49.923
Why are you being so easy on her?

22:49.958 --> 22:52.292
I'm not being easy. But she read my book.

22:52.294 --> 22:54.761
And Dr. Weiss thinks that I should begin...

22:54.796 --> 22:56.630
This is about the death penalty.

22:56.682 --> 22:58.548
I don't wanna hear about that horny quack.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.133
Horny?

23:00.185 --> 23:02.636
Listen, I can't let you
make a fool of yourself.

23:02.688 --> 23:04.471
She's walking all over you.

23:04.523 --> 23:08.308
But she could be Mary
Matalin to my James Carville.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.810
Walter, focus.

23:10.812 --> 23:13.897
The death penalty is racist and barbaric.

23:13.949 --> 23:16.900
Only China, Saudi Arabia and Iran

23:16.952 --> 23:18.652
have more executions than we do.

23:18.704 --> 23:20.654
You forgot Iraq.

23:20.706 --> 23:22.455
No, you forgot Iraq.

23:22.491 --> 23:25.709
You're Walter Blunt. Now act like him.

23:25.744 --> 23:29.079
You made your point. I
needed that. Thank you.

23:29.131 --> 23:30.664
15 seconds.

23:30.666 --> 23:32.165
Oh, while you were shouting at me,

23:32.217 --> 23:34.467
I saw you have a contact lens
stuck between your breasts.

23:39.341 --> 23:42.008
And we are back talking
with Suzanne Mayview,

23:42.060 --> 23:43.810
author of An Eye for An Eye:

23:43.845 --> 23:46.012
Why America Needs the Death Penalty.

23:46.014 --> 23:48.348
Isn't it shameful, Suzanne,

23:48.350 --> 23:52.819
that America has the fifth-most
executions in the world?

23:52.854 --> 23:57.574
Trailing only China, Saudi
Arabia, Iraq, and Iran.

23:57.609 --> 23:59.326
No. No, I just think of the families

23:59.361 --> 24:01.361
of the victims and how they need closure.

24:01.413 --> 24:05.699
So what about the families
of those wrongfully executed?

24:05.751 --> 24:07.834
They'll never have closure.

24:07.869 --> 24:12.289
An eye for an eye will
only make the world blind.

24:12.341 --> 24:15.008
Walter, you've been in battle.

24:15.043 --> 24:18.211
Quoting Gandhi in the
21st century is naive.

24:18.213 --> 24:20.714
Pardon me, but it is you
who are being naive, Suzanne.

24:20.716 --> 24:22.265
Oh, I'm naive? Come on.

24:22.301 --> 24:23.967
No, I'm sorry. You're being naive

24:24.019 --> 24:26.436
and you are reckless with
the value of human life.

24:26.471 --> 24:29.939
Yes, it is true. I have
killed in the name of war.

24:29.975 --> 24:32.726
But it was war that made me a pacifist.

24:32.728 --> 24:35.111
It was war that made me want to protect

24:35.147 --> 24:37.197
the innocent and the guilty.

24:37.232 --> 24:39.899
So if America wants to be
the leader of the free world,

24:39.951 --> 24:43.820
then it must not kill at home.

24:43.872 --> 24:48.124
Answering murder with
murder is not an answer.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.076
We'll be back right after this.

24:54.416 --> 24:55.882
Thank God!

24:58.887 --> 25:01.221
Here's your contact lens, dear.

25:04.259 --> 25:06.259
I'm winning, but you're losing.

25:06.311 --> 25:08.928
A clever player knows when to quit.

25:08.980 --> 25:12.265
A clever player knows how
to win, and I'm clever.

25:12.317 --> 25:13.650
I went to Oxford.

25:16.772 --> 25:18.855
Celia, no. No coaching.

25:18.907 --> 25:21.024
Yeah, skirt's on her own.

25:25.447 --> 25:27.831
I can't believe my magician
gave me fake pearls.

25:27.866 --> 25:30.533
Forget the damn pearls, Celia, just run!

25:36.591 --> 25:39.342
I'm gonna fuck you up, Harry!

25:41.129 --> 25:43.296
Be honest.

25:43.348 --> 25:47.016
All that stuff back in the green room.

25:47.052 --> 25:50.687
Were you just trying to soften me up?

25:50.722 --> 25:53.139
- Hmm?
- I was.

25:53.141 --> 25:55.308
Ah.

25:55.310 --> 25:58.945
But I was also very attracted to you.

25:58.980 --> 26:00.980
- Really?
- Mm.

26:01.032 --> 26:02.399
You really roughed me up.

26:02.451 --> 26:05.485
Just now or during the broadcast?

26:05.487 --> 26:07.237
- Both.
- Ah.

26:07.289 --> 26:10.073
Our interview was like foreplay.

26:10.125 --> 26:13.576
I hope I wasn't too rough with you.

26:13.628 --> 26:16.162
Mm-mm. Perfect.

26:16.164 --> 26:18.915
You know, every woman adores a fascist.

26:18.967 --> 26:20.467
A boot in the face.

26:20.502 --> 26:23.052
Who the hell said that? Mussolini?

26:23.088 --> 26:25.255
No, Sylvia Plath.

26:25.307 --> 26:27.507
Oh. Snax...

26:29.177 --> 26:32.312
I wish you didn't live in Oklahoma.

26:32.347 --> 26:35.301
Hey, you know they still have
the death penalty in California.
