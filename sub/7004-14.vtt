00:01.133 --> 00:03.802
We all know a detroit winter
can wreak havoc on your roof.

00:03.803 --> 00:05.670
Accumulated snow
and ice can melt,

00:05.671 --> 00:08.539
Then refreeze in your overhang,
blocking up your gutters.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.976
When al's gutters are blocked,
he gets really cranky.

00:10.977 --> 00:14.112
His face gets all bloated,
big red blotches.

00:14.113 --> 00:16.114
"I don't feel so good."

00:16.114 --> 00:17.148
Tim...

00:17.149 --> 00:19.818
Blocked roof gutters
can form an ice dam,

00:19.819 --> 00:22.353
Causing the water to back up
under the shingles

00:22.354 --> 00:24.355
And leak into the house.
All right.

00:24.356 --> 00:26.625
You can melt the ice
and prevent it
from refreezing

00:26.626 --> 00:28.627
Using binford's
new heating coils.

00:28.628 --> 00:31.529
Now, they're very simple
to install. Marv will come in
and take a look at this.

00:31.530 --> 00:34.332
Little clips are fastened
underneath the cable

00:34.333 --> 00:36.835
And there underneath
your shingles, just like so.

00:36.836 --> 00:39.938
Now, once they are properly
in place,

00:39.939 --> 00:43.675
They are guaranteed to work
every "shingle" time.

00:49.248 --> 00:53.384
And now you know
why al's a "shingle" man,
jokes like that.

00:53.385 --> 00:56.788
Now, in order to demonstrate
how these cables melt the snow,

00:56.789 --> 00:59.357
We'd have to spend hours
installing the coils.

00:59.358 --> 01:02.093
We'd also have to make it snow
in the building. Hmm.

01:02.094 --> 01:06.097
And that hasn't happened
since tim blew a hole
in the roof.

01:06.098 --> 01:08.700
As fun as that was,
I went a different route
this morning.

01:08.701 --> 01:11.602
I went over to al's mom's house,
chopped off a piece of her home,

01:11.603 --> 01:14.438
Put snow on it
and attached the coils
in a zigzag pattern.

01:14.439 --> 01:17.075
This is not a piece
of my mother's house.

01:17.076 --> 01:19.577
She lives in a perfectly
wonderful mobile home.

01:19.578 --> 01:21.579
You've probably seen it
on the freeways.

01:21.580 --> 01:25.083
Big sign on the back -
"wide load, look out."

01:26.585 --> 01:28.820
Now, the cables
are controlled
by a thermostat.

01:28.821 --> 01:30.822
They turn on
when the weather gets cold

01:30.823 --> 01:32.824
And they turn off
as the temperature rises.

01:32.825 --> 01:34.659
We've already set
the thermostat.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.228
Let's show the audience
how it works.

01:37.229 --> 01:39.898
<i>(sizzles)</i>

01:39.899 --> 01:43.201
How much voltage did you put
in this?

01:44.436 --> 01:45.503
240.

01:47.773 --> 01:50.175
I believe it's only regulated
to 120.

01:50.176 --> 01:53.678
Right, but it would take
24 hours to melt the ice,
so I juiced it up a little bit,

01:53.679 --> 01:56.581
'cause we got a show
to do here, al.

01:56.582 --> 02:00.484
And look at that.
No more blocked gutters.

03:02.748 --> 03:05.016
<i>(male narrator) after</i>
<i>the praying mantis mates,</i>

03:05.017 --> 03:08.753
<i>The female of the species</i>
<i>devours the male.</i>

03:08.754 --> 03:11.756
I guess that rules out
a second date.

03:14.293 --> 03:18.329
Randy, do you realize that
every pair of jeans you own
have holes in them?

03:18.330 --> 03:21.299
You're dead. She's gonna
take you shopping.

03:21.300 --> 03:25.703
So, anyway, we're gonna have
to go shopping this weekend.

03:25.704 --> 03:29.507
Mom, shopping with you
is really embarrassing.
It is not.

03:29.508 --> 03:31.575
Well, you drag me
into the stupidest stores,

03:31.576 --> 03:33.577
You make me try on
dorky clothes,

03:33.578 --> 03:36.614
Then you follow me
into the dressing room.

03:36.615 --> 03:39.851
Well, it's not like
I'm the only mother
that does that.

03:39.852 --> 03:44.189
And if all the mothers
jumped into lake michigan,
would you do it, too?

03:48.027 --> 03:52.663
You are going jeans shopping,
whether you like it or not.

03:52.664 --> 03:54.999
Hi, guys.
Come on, mom,
pants are the worst.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.768
I mean, as soon
as I try 'em on,
you stick your hands in.

03:57.769 --> 04:01.372
I have to see if they fit.
You know, you have to do
that little jiggle thing.

04:01.373 --> 04:03.374
Oh, the pant-jiggle thing.
Very embarrassing.

04:03.375 --> 04:06.077
She does it to me
all the time.
Thought you said you liked it.

04:06.078 --> 04:09.314
I do. You wanna
jiggle me later?
Sure.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.983
Hey, mom, why can't dad
take me shopping?
Yeah.

04:11.984 --> 04:14.485
Oh, there's an idea.

04:14.486 --> 04:17.154
Send you to the mall
with the man

04:17.156 --> 04:20.690
Whose fundamental approach
to shopping is speed.

04:20.692 --> 04:25.196
My goal is to spend $0-60
in under 4 seconds.

04:25.197 --> 04:27.198
And you don't
check any labels,

04:27.199 --> 04:29.667
You don't compare prices,
you don't try anything on.

04:29.668 --> 04:31.802
That's why
they have sizes, honey.

04:31.803 --> 04:35.506
I'm a 32 waist,
I buy 32 pants.

04:35.507 --> 04:38.176
32, dad? Come on.

04:40.679 --> 04:43.181
Hey, guys. Jill.

04:43.182 --> 04:46.885
I think I found some news
bigger than my pants.

04:46.886 --> 04:49.487
Looks like my hot rod's
gonna be in its first
hot rod show.

04:49.488 --> 04:51.189
Really? That's great.

04:51.190 --> 04:53.958
Yeah, somebody dropped out
of the custom car show
at cobo.

04:53.959 --> 04:55.659
And look where I am.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.695
Right between the beer stand
and the bathrooms.

04:57.696 --> 05:00.431
Every guy in the place
is gonna be walking by me.

05:02.034 --> 05:04.602
Did you say between
the beer stand and bathroom?

05:04.603 --> 05:08.306
Yeah. Beer stand, bathroom.
Well, I guess you'll get
that flush-hour traffic.

05:10.041 --> 05:13.378
Yesterday we talked about cold,
today we're talking about hot.

05:13.379 --> 05:16.014
Hot dogs, hot cars, hot rods.

05:16.015 --> 05:18.016
Hot dates.

05:19.785 --> 05:22.520
Something al knows
very little about.

05:22.521 --> 05:24.655
We're talking
about hot rods today.
That's right.

05:24.656 --> 05:26.657
And our special guest
is one of the sponsors

05:26.658 --> 05:28.726
Of the custom car show
at cobo hall,

05:28.727 --> 05:31.429
A big car collector
and one of detroit's own -

05:31.430 --> 05:32.997
Mr. Doug o'brien!

05:36.835 --> 05:39.404
Hey, doug.
Welcome to the show.
Mr. O'brien.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.205
Take a seat.
Ok.

05:41.206 --> 05:42.974
All right.

05:42.975 --> 05:46.644
Now, I, for one,
am pretty gosh-darn excited
about the custom car show.

05:46.645 --> 05:49.247
I understand there are cars
from all over the us and canada.

05:49.248 --> 05:50.714
That's right.
And also from Italy.

05:50.715 --> 05:52.550
We've got a couple from
as far away as new zealand.

05:52.551 --> 05:54.819
Many of them, I might add,
brought to you by my company,

05:54.820 --> 05:56.554
Papa mia's pizza.

05:56.555 --> 05:58.756
You're papa mia?
I am.

05:58.757 --> 06:01.459
I love your pizza.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.861
As a big car collector,
you've seen a lot of cars.

06:03.862 --> 06:05.997
What gives you a big thrill
at a show like this?

06:05.998 --> 06:07.999
I'm an old-fashioned guy, tim,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.134
And no matter
how many hot rods I own,

06:10.135 --> 06:13.338
I really get a thrill
out of seeing a beautifully
crafted restoration.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.673
I bet it's the same kind
of thrill I get

06:15.674 --> 06:18.509
Every time I eat
one of your pizzas.

06:18.510 --> 06:21.179
Al, put a sausage in it,
will you?

06:22.814 --> 06:25.516
I know you're a car guy,
and everybody else
is gonna love this.

06:25.517 --> 06:27.651
Uh, marv, wanna follow us
outside?

06:27.652 --> 06:30.654
I got something to show you,
something you'll see
next week at the car show.

06:30.655 --> 06:33.724
How are you, guys?
How's your sister doing?
All right?

06:33.725 --> 06:36.760
When did you go
to the thin crust?
The guy outta jail yet?

06:36.761 --> 06:41.032
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to present
three years of hard work -

06:41.033 --> 06:43.468
Tim taylor's blue goose,
my hot rod.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.470
Whoa. Beautiful '33.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.805
Chopped windshield frame,
great-looking short block.

06:47.806 --> 06:51.342
It is a 350 chevy.
As a matter of fact,
al helped me put this in.

06:51.343 --> 06:53.344
That's right, I did.
I still remember the night.

06:53.345 --> 06:55.213
We ordered
your deep-dish super papa

06:55.214 --> 06:56.814
With eggplant
and canadian bacon.

06:56.815 --> 06:59.384
How'd you find the time
to do all this?

06:59.385 --> 07:01.685
You must have
a pretty understanding wife.

07:01.686 --> 07:04.489
Well, she's certainly pretty.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.657
I started with a bare frame
and I built it up from there.

07:06.658 --> 07:10.328
You notice I got special
color-coded, powder-coated
holley double pumpers.

07:10.329 --> 07:13.531
Oh, every car guy
takes pleasure in adding
his own special touches.

07:13.532 --> 07:16.767
Oh, boy. You know what
I take pleasure in?
Your hawaiian pizza.

07:16.768 --> 07:19.404
And when you add the extra
pineapple, it's to die for.

07:19.405 --> 07:23.307
Why don't we just order al
a big one right now?

07:27.746 --> 07:30.481
<i>(tim)</i> evening, wilson.
Hi-de-ho, neighbor.

07:30.482 --> 07:32.050
What are you up to?

07:32.051 --> 07:35.486
I'm using paraffin
to make candles
in the snow.

07:35.487 --> 07:38.189
Huh. Speaking
of a "pair of fins,"

07:38.190 --> 07:40.191
My car was supposed
to be sitting

07:40.192 --> 07:42.193
Next to a beautiful '59 cadillac
at the car show,

07:42.194 --> 07:43.827
But that's changed a little.

07:43.828 --> 07:45.363
So what happened?

07:45.364 --> 07:47.598
Did you lose your spot
between the beer
and the bathroom?

07:47.599 --> 07:50.268
I met this guy
named papa mia...

07:50.269 --> 07:52.270
Whoa, papa mia
the pizza magnate?

07:52.271 --> 07:56.274
Boy, my favorite is
his large cilantro
with feta cheese.

07:56.275 --> 07:59.544
That's great.
I like it with extra snails.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.779
They put snails on a pizza?

08:01.780 --> 08:06.084
No, no, tim.
I put those snails on myself.

08:06.085 --> 08:09.220
Anyway, papa mia
is this car collector.

08:09.221 --> 08:12.356
He offered me a chunk of change
for my hot rod, so I sold it.

08:12.357 --> 08:15.059
Tim.

08:15.060 --> 08:18.796
You sold the hot rod?
I'm taken aback.

08:18.797 --> 08:21.932
I can't take it aback now.
I already gave it to him.

08:21.933 --> 08:25.603
No, no, no. I'm surprised.
You put a lot of work
into that hot rod.

08:25.604 --> 08:29.373
Well, yeah, I did.
But the work was kinda
what I liked, you know?

08:29.374 --> 08:32.309
I was thinking about it today -
all the fun I had with it.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.578
I got pictures here.
Look at this.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.147
That's when I first
had the chassis.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.682
Oh, that is a very
photogenic chassis.
Isn't it?

08:38.683 --> 08:40.818
And look, that's when I put
the small block in there.

08:40.818 --> 08:43.787
Rebuilt everything, painted it.
That's out of the paint shop.
Wow.

08:43.788 --> 08:47.091
And that's where I bronzed
his first set of brake shoes.

08:47.092 --> 08:49.093
You know, it's so funny, tim.

08:49.094 --> 08:51.762
Most guys would have
pictures of their family
in their wallet.

08:51.763 --> 08:54.132
Yeah, it is funny,
isn't it, really?

08:54.133 --> 08:57.034
They're back here.
Oh, there they are.

08:57.035 --> 08:59.337
Sitting in the hot rod.

09:00.972 --> 09:03.073
You are not getting
out of it, randy.

09:03.074 --> 09:06.076
You're going pants shopping
in the morning.

09:06.077 --> 09:09.847
No way, mom.
I'm going with dad
to the hot rod show tomorrow.

09:09.848 --> 09:11.949
Oh, I forgot
about the hot rod show

09:11.950 --> 09:15.119
And how much you were
looking forward to it.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.955
Too bad.
You're going shopping with me.

09:20.225 --> 09:23.628
Hi! Guess what happened
today on <i>tool time.</i>

09:23.629 --> 09:24.928
Lemme guess.

09:24.929 --> 09:27.765
The firemen let you put out
your own fire.

09:27.766 --> 09:30.668
Yeah, they did.

09:30.669 --> 09:32.870
But before that we had
a special guest on the show -

09:32.871 --> 09:34.605
Papa mia the pizza guy.

09:34.606 --> 09:37.841
Oh, yeah, papa mia pizza.
"if we're not there
in 30 minutes..."

09:37.842 --> 09:42.079
<i>(both)</i>
"...You shoulda given us
better directions."

09:42.080 --> 09:44.182
Anyway, papa mia loved
my hot rod so much,

09:44.183 --> 09:46.184
He made me
quite a nice offer.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.352
Well... You didn't
take it, did you?

09:48.353 --> 09:49.687
Oh, don't be silly.

09:49.688 --> 09:51.689
Your father put his heart
and soul into that car.

09:51.690 --> 09:53.924
You can't put a price
on your soul.

09:53.925 --> 09:56.327
Yeah, you can.

09:56.328 --> 09:59.897
You didn't sell
the hot rod?
Yeah.

09:59.898 --> 10:02.433
You sold the hot rod?

10:02.434 --> 10:04.435
Dad, how could you
have done that?

10:04.436 --> 10:06.704
You said when I got my license,
I could drive it.

10:06.705 --> 10:09.574
Yeah, me, too.
I can't believe this.

10:09.575 --> 10:12.142
When you see the zeroes
in this check,
you'll believe it.

10:12.143 --> 10:14.144
I don't care
about the money.

10:14.145 --> 10:16.980
I just don't understand
how you could sell something
you love just like that.

10:16.981 --> 10:20.418
Yeah. I thought we'd
have to bury you in it.

10:20.419 --> 10:22.920
Come on, guys.
What's up here?

10:22.921 --> 10:25.489
Tim, where do you
draw the line?

10:25.490 --> 10:28.559
I mean, for enough money,
are you gonna sell your tools?
Me? The kids?

10:28.560 --> 10:31.696
I'm not selling my tools.

10:34.733 --> 10:37.268
Dad, I can't believe
you actually did this.

10:37.269 --> 10:40.271
If you were gonna sell it,
you could've at least told me.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.806
I helped you build that.
I know. I wasn't planning
on selling it.

10:42.807 --> 10:44.742
I thought you and I were
gonna go cruising in it

10:44.743 --> 10:46.944
And showing off for people.

10:46.945 --> 10:50.814
Next time you need help,
don't bother asking me.

10:50.815 --> 10:54.452
Come on, brad. Brad?

10:54.453 --> 10:57.154
I didn't think
he'd take it like this.

10:57.155 --> 10:58.822
Well, how would you feel

10:58.823 --> 11:01.825
If you put three years
into something
with your father

11:01.826 --> 11:04.962
And he went and he sold it
right out from under you?

11:04.963 --> 11:07.765
Should I go try
to get it back?

11:07.766 --> 11:11.435
I think that you should do
what you think is right.

11:11.436 --> 11:14.004
Oh, I hate it
when you say that.

11:40.098 --> 11:43.701
Hello, information.
I'd like the number
for papa mia's pizza.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.404
No, no. Not the delivery,
their corporate offices.

11:46.405 --> 11:49.507
Uh-huh?
Yes, I understand.

11:49.508 --> 11:52.810
Mushroom and artichoke?
Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

11:52.811 --> 11:56.414
Yeah? Oh, it's to die for,
right? Yeah, that's great.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.248
Well, I don't really have -
uh-huh.

11:58.249 --> 12:00.551
I know, the breadsticks...
Ooh, boy.

12:00.552 --> 12:02.219
You know what I'm gonna do?

12:02.220 --> 12:05.222
I'm just gonna go let my fingers
do the walking. You go - uh-huh.

12:05.223 --> 12:08.091
I've never had that salad
with that combination. Ok.

12:08.092 --> 12:10.160
Thank you. Goodbye.

12:14.032 --> 12:17.368
Oh, these are darling.

12:17.369 --> 12:21.639
Mom, "darling" will get
my butt kicked at school.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.175
Don't put 'em down
till you've tried them on.

12:25.176 --> 12:27.211
Do you think we have enough?

12:27.212 --> 12:28.879
We have enough pants,

12:28.880 --> 12:31.081
But now
we have to get shirts
to go with them.

12:31.082 --> 12:33.684
Shirts? You never said
anything about shirts.

12:33.685 --> 12:36.053
Well, honey, if you don't get
shirts to go with the pants,

12:36.054 --> 12:39.189
Then you don't have
an outfit.

12:39.190 --> 12:41.191
Mom, guys do not wear
outfits.

12:41.192 --> 12:44.127
I mean, why don't you
just put me in a dress?

12:45.864 --> 12:48.065
You know, I think you should
try this bigger size.

12:48.066 --> 12:50.901
It might give you more room
in the seat.

12:50.902 --> 12:52.903
Randy? Oh, sorry.

12:54.706 --> 12:56.507
Oh. Randy?

12:56.508 --> 12:58.676
Mom!

12:58.677 --> 13:01.979
Oh, please.
Like I haven't seen it before.

13:01.980 --> 13:04.882
Come on out here.
I want to look at these.

13:04.883 --> 13:08.285
Well, length looks ok.

13:08.286 --> 13:10.053
How's the crotch?

13:10.054 --> 13:12.055
Could you say "crotch"
a little louder?

13:12.056 --> 13:14.191
I don't think
everybody heard you.

13:14.192 --> 13:16.927
Would you haul this up around
so I can see the waist?

13:16.928 --> 13:19.363
Let me see how it fits.

13:19.364 --> 13:21.699
Do you have to jiggle?
I mean...

13:24.269 --> 13:26.270
What if someone I know
sees me?

13:26.271 --> 13:29.006
Oh, please,
nobody is looking at you.

13:29.007 --> 13:31.742
Hi, randy.

13:31.743 --> 13:35.746
Beth. Hi.

13:35.747 --> 13:37.848
Hi, beth.
Hi, mrs. Taylor.

13:37.849 --> 13:40.284
So, beth, what are you
doing here?

13:40.285 --> 13:42.019
Shopping for clothes.

13:42.020 --> 13:45.489
Shopping for clothes.
Good thing to do
in a clothing store.

13:45.490 --> 13:48.759
So how did you do
on that biology test today?

13:48.760 --> 13:51.161
I missed an easy one
on vertebrae. You know?

13:51.162 --> 13:54.131
That is such a funny word -
"vertebrae."

13:54.132 --> 13:57.000
But then again,
so is "protoplasm."

13:57.001 --> 13:59.403
Oh, boy.

13:59.404 --> 14:01.772
So... Do you shop
in this store a lot?

14:01.773 --> 14:03.774
Well, yeah...

14:05.243 --> 14:08.078
But not with my mom.
I mean, we just happened
to be in here.

14:08.079 --> 14:09.713
I was looking
for pants and...

14:09.714 --> 14:13.684
Yeah, I was over
at the cheese chalet
buying a gouda log.

14:13.685 --> 14:15.920
I never shop
for randy anymore.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.922
He's obviously old enough
to buy his own stuff.

14:17.923 --> 14:20.858
What do you think
about this for me?
Ma'am?

14:20.859 --> 14:24.929
Is this the kind
of underwear you wanted
for your little boy?

14:32.471 --> 14:35.138
Oh, please. It was not
that embarrassing.

14:35.139 --> 14:36.640
Yes, it was, mom.

14:36.641 --> 14:39.209
Now tomorrow everyone at
school's gonna come up to me

14:39.210 --> 14:42.245
And try and jiggle my pants.

14:42.246 --> 14:45.649
Honey, it is not
the end of the world.

14:45.650 --> 14:49.553
Everybody has
something embarrassing
happen to them sometime.

14:49.554 --> 14:51.489
When I was your age,

14:51.490 --> 14:54.859
I was in the school lunchroom
with a whole bunch of boys

14:54.860 --> 14:57.027
And somebody told
a stupid joke,

14:57.028 --> 15:00.297
And I laughed so hard
that chocolate milk came
right out of my nose.

15:00.298 --> 15:02.533
Thought I was going to die.

15:02.534 --> 15:06.637
Then did your mom run in
and show everybody your bra?

15:10.575 --> 15:12.109
Well, no.

15:12.110 --> 15:15.178
Try me again
when you have a story
that involves underwear.

15:17.048 --> 15:20.117
Hey, randy,
how was shopping?
What did you get?

15:20.118 --> 15:22.520
Humiliated.

15:24.355 --> 15:25.689
What happened?

15:25.690 --> 15:28.592
Oh, he thinks
I embarrassed him
at the mall.

15:28.593 --> 15:32.262
What did you do this time,
give him a bath
in the fountain?

15:32.263 --> 15:35.065
No, tim.
How'd it go with papa mia?

15:35.066 --> 15:37.735
Not real well. Thanks.
Talked to him on the phone.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.404
There's no way he's going
to sell the hot rod back.

15:40.405 --> 15:44.307
He did give me a coupon
for a medium pizza.
What are you gonna do?

15:44.308 --> 15:48.111
Probably go
with the diced peaches
and clam sauce.

15:48.112 --> 15:51.715
I mean about the car.
I'll go down to papa mia's
and talk to him man-to-man.

15:51.716 --> 15:54.284
Maybe take you
and brad with me.
Why brad?

15:54.285 --> 15:56.520
If he sees how upset he is,
maybe we'll get the car back.

15:56.521 --> 15:58.388
What if papa mia
doesn't care?

15:58.389 --> 16:00.758
Maybe we could talk
to his wife.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.760
Mama mia?

16:05.363 --> 16:07.531
Right this way.

16:07.532 --> 16:11.201
Well, here's
mr. O'brien's collection.

16:11.202 --> 16:14.071
Oh, dad, check out...
Don't touch anything!

16:15.707 --> 16:18.442
Hey, brad,
check this out.
A bentley.

16:18.443 --> 16:19.877
So, what do you think?

16:19.878 --> 16:22.813
I think I've died
and gone to heaven.

16:22.814 --> 16:25.816
If this were heaven,
I wouldn't be making
$4.35 an hour.

16:27.752 --> 16:30.287
I'll go tell mr. O'brien
you're here.
<i>(tim)</i> thank you.

16:30.288 --> 16:32.623
So, um,
do you think maybe
I could look around?

16:32.624 --> 16:33.991
Well, sure.
Help yourself.

16:33.992 --> 16:36.193
Dad, these cars
are awesome.
Yeah.

16:36.194 --> 16:38.729
Don't touch it!

16:38.730 --> 16:41.398
Ooh, jill, look at this.
It's a '29 or '30 duesenberg.

16:41.399 --> 16:42.766
Isn't this pretty?

16:42.767 --> 16:45.268
Dad, check it out.
A '32 packard.

16:45.269 --> 16:47.805
<i>(sighs)</i>

16:47.806 --> 16:51.274
You guys are starting
to drool.

16:51.275 --> 16:55.378
Hey. Can you people
read the sign?

16:58.116 --> 17:01.184
No eating... Drinking...

17:01.185 --> 17:02.319
Or drooling!

17:05.289 --> 17:07.190
Keep moving.

17:07.191 --> 17:08.791
All right.

17:14.065 --> 17:17.701
Hey, brad.
Remember, every time
o'brien looks at you,

17:17.702 --> 17:20.604
Work on
that pathetic face, ok?

17:20.605 --> 17:22.673
Oh, come on, you can do
better than that.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.208
You know the one that you make
when I tell you we have to

17:25.209 --> 17:27.243
Go to aunt lucille's
for the day?

17:27.244 --> 17:29.312
Not you, tim.

17:31.082 --> 17:33.017
That's good, that's good.

17:33.018 --> 17:37.521
Now, remember, squeezing out
some tears - that could help.

17:37.522 --> 17:40.658
Wow. Another duesenberg.
Ohh...

17:40.659 --> 17:44.261
This is a limo, too.
This is worth
over a million bucks.

17:44.262 --> 17:47.831
A million dollars?
What kind of fool would pay
a million dollars for a car?

17:47.832 --> 17:49.633
This kind of fool.

17:51.402 --> 17:55.005
Oh, you think I said "fool"?
I said "fuel."

17:55.006 --> 17:58.575
They must use a lot of fuel.

17:58.576 --> 18:01.444
Doug o'brien, I'd like you
to meet my wife jill taylor.
Hi.

18:01.445 --> 18:04.181
And this is my son sad...
I mean, brad.

18:04.182 --> 18:05.282
What's wrong with him?

18:05.283 --> 18:08.552
He's a little sad
about the car.

18:08.553 --> 18:11.388
I'm sorry, son,
but like I told
your father on the phone,

18:11.389 --> 18:13.423
I can't sell him back
his car.

18:13.424 --> 18:15.893
Mr. O'brien,
you gotta hear him out.

18:15.894 --> 18:18.896
There's nothing to talk about.
A deal's a deal.

18:21.399 --> 18:24.434
Mr. O'brien, I sold this car
before I really had a chance
to think about it.

18:24.435 --> 18:27.771
Do you always make decisions
without thinking?
Constantly!

18:29.741 --> 18:33.043
He is the most impulsive person
that you will ever meet.

18:33.044 --> 18:35.045
And I mean that in a bad way.

18:35.046 --> 18:37.981
It took me three years
to build this hot rod,

18:37.982 --> 18:40.517
And it means
an awful lot to me.

18:40.518 --> 18:43.821
Look, this car means
a lot to me, too.

18:43.822 --> 18:47.457
When I was a kid, my daddy
had a '33 ford roadster.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.159
He loved that car.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.195
And even though
he didn't have any money,

18:51.196 --> 18:55.465
When he rode around in that car,
he felt like a million bucks.

18:55.466 --> 18:57.634
When I wanted to start
my own business,

18:57.635 --> 19:00.270
I didn't have a nickel.

19:00.271 --> 19:04.942
Daddy sold his car so I could
buy my first pizza oven.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.477
Wow.

19:07.478 --> 19:11.915
And now... You're papa mia,
the pizza guy.

19:11.916 --> 19:14.852
When I was on <i>tool time,</i>
daddy saw the car

19:14.853 --> 19:18.222
And it reminded him
of the one he gave up for me.

19:18.223 --> 19:20.224
Next month is daddy's
75th birthday

19:20.225 --> 19:22.325
And I can't think
of a thing in the world

19:22.326 --> 19:26.663
That would make
that wonderful old man
any happier than this car.

19:27.832 --> 19:30.868
Buy him a pizza oven.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.971
Tim, there's no way
we're gonna get
the hot rod back.

19:33.972 --> 19:36.774
You want daddy to be unhappy
on his 75th birthday?

19:36.775 --> 19:39.476
I don't even know daddy.

19:39.477 --> 19:42.079
Hey, dad,
check this one out.
What is it?

19:42.080 --> 19:44.882
It's a '46 ford convertible.

19:44.883 --> 19:47.985
Excuse me.
Don't touch it!

19:47.986 --> 19:49.987
<i>(grunts)</i>

19:49.988 --> 19:51.554
I think it's a '48, son.

19:51.555 --> 19:54.858
No, no, no, no! It's got
the marker lights there.

19:54.859 --> 19:58.095
Yeah, you're right -
it's a '46. Ugh.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.864
Boy, what a mess.
Yeah,
it's a piece of junk.

20:00.865 --> 20:04.034
Needs a lot of work.
Yeah, but isn't it great?

20:04.035 --> 20:06.636
We could chop
and channel this thing.
Yeah. Shave the bumpers.

20:06.637 --> 20:09.639
Wait a minute.
Put a big block in
and retro the interior.

20:09.640 --> 20:14.178
Yeah. You know how much fun
this thing would be to work on?
You know what I like?

20:14.179 --> 20:17.181
What excites you about cars
is all the work that goes
into them.

20:17.182 --> 20:19.983
Hey, o'brien,
is this thing for sale?

20:19.984 --> 20:21.751
I'll tell you what.

20:21.752 --> 20:24.754
One car guy to another,
I'll make you a great deal
on this car.

20:24.755 --> 20:27.424
Let's do it.
All right! Awesome.

20:27.425 --> 20:30.627
This is great. Hear that?
We have a new car to rebuild.

20:30.628 --> 20:32.196
Oh, no.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.036
It's gonna be fun.
The whole...

20:39.037 --> 20:40.570
You know something?

20:40.571 --> 20:43.073
Of all the cars here,
that would've been
my choice.

20:43.074 --> 20:45.075
Smart move.

20:52.350 --> 20:54.684
<i>(brad)</i> this'll be fun.

20:57.055 --> 21:00.357
We need to get
some better interiors.
Whoa!

21:03.194 --> 21:05.495
<i>(male narrator)</i>
<i>that concludes our look</i>

21:05.496 --> 21:08.265
<i>At the sexual reproduction</i>
<i>habits of the buffalo.</i>

<i>Next week,</i>
<i>we'll take a look</i>

21:10.801 --> 21:14.504
<i>At sex</i>
<i>and the humpback whale.</i>

21:14.505 --> 21:18.108
What is this,
the mating channel?

21:18.109 --> 21:20.244
Can't you guys find
something else to watch?

21:20.245 --> 21:24.081
Fine. We'll just have
to learn about the humpback
on the streets.

21:26.184 --> 21:29.586
Randy, I got you something else
from the clothing store.

21:29.587 --> 21:32.890
No way. I'm not trying on
any more clothes
for the rest of my life.

21:32.891 --> 21:35.325
I think you'll like this.

21:38.629 --> 21:40.663
It's a gift certificate.
Yup.

21:40.664 --> 21:43.934
Next time you need pants,
you can just go to the store
and get whatever you want.

21:43.935 --> 21:46.036
You won't be at the store
with me?

21:46.037 --> 21:48.205
If you like, I won't be
in the same country.

21:48.206 --> 21:50.240
Hey, sounds good to us.

21:50.241 --> 21:52.509
Thank you, mark.

21:52.510 --> 21:55.379
Come on, you guys.
Wanna see the new hot rod?
Yeah!

21:55.380 --> 21:58.481
What took you so long?
It's only, like,
a 20-minute drive.

21:58.482 --> 22:01.484
Yeah, but when the engine dies,
it takes a little longer.

22:01.485 --> 22:04.221
Especially when I have to
do all the pushing.

22:04.222 --> 22:07.024
Hey, it's all part of
being a car guy, buddy.
<i>(laughs)</i>

22:07.025 --> 22:11.028
Well, guys. Take a look
at your new kid sister.

22:13.664 --> 22:16.666
She looks old enough
to be our grandmother.

22:19.203 --> 22:22.406

Hi. This is tim taylor

22:34.518 --> 22:36.987
We'd like to order
one of those pizzas of yours.

22:36.988 --> 22:40.958
I'll go with the sea squid
and the pollum sperm. Yeah.

22:42.460 --> 22:45.429
Pollum sperm?

22:45.430 --> 22:48.432
I talked to him on the phone.
There's no way we're getting
the hot rod back.
