WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:07.007
<i>Previously on</i> SEAL Tea... How did Natalie take the news

00:07.050 --> 00:08.269
-of you kitting up again?
-Get Ray back, that's it.

00:08.312 --> 00:11.011
After that, it's back to life
after Bravo.

00:11.054 --> 00:13.317
<i>I was able to single out
a container ship.</i>

00:13.361 --> 00:14.666
-The <i>Aafrah.
Ray's on that ship.</i>

00:14.710 --> 00:16.712
Now. <i>Whoever sees this,</i>

00:16.755 --> 00:18.714
I want you to know I died
doing what I loved.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.672
I got him.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.591
He's alive.

00:26.635 --> 00:27.636
Here to bring you home.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.680
<i>Tomorrow isn't promised</i>

00:28.724 --> 00:30.465
-to any of us.
-Kind of makes you,

00:30.508 --> 00:32.249
uh, reconsider things that,

00:32.293 --> 00:33.685
you know, you've
been putting off.

00:33.729 --> 00:34.817
He reinstated me. Bravo.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.384
I'm happy for you, buddy.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.777
Get everything you want
right in front of you.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.518
Is Bravo 1
back in the saddle for good?

00:40.562 --> 00:42.999
This was my last dance.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.664
Hurry it up. Time's a-wasting.

00:55.707 --> 00:56.969
Set.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.493
Go.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.455
Hayes.

01:04.499 --> 01:06.327
Ops meeting. You're late.

01:16.772 --> 01:20.689
A little welcome back present,
Ricky Schroder.

01:20.732 --> 01:21.733
Fire in the hole!

01:29.393 --> 01:30.742
Oh, you can taste it.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.946
What
tactics did your captors employ

02:00.990 --> 02:03.775
during captivity?

02:03.819 --> 02:07.431
Psychological,
then physical torture.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.433
Ice picks. Power tools.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.479
Did you employ any specific
tactics to survive?

02:11.522 --> 02:14.090
I, uh, I relied
on my SERE training.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.439
Did the enemy employ

02:15.483 --> 02:16.745
known techniques
to try to break you?

02:16.788 --> 02:19.878
Straight out of the playbook.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.619
Did you rely
on your SERE training

02:21.663 --> 02:24.405
to cope
with the situation?

02:24.448 --> 02:26.624
Never strayed
from the six rules.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.017
How did you
manage being under the control

02:28.060 --> 02:29.366
of these terrorists?

02:29.410 --> 02:32.543
As I told
the intelligence officers

02:32.587 --> 02:37.374
and the SERE administrators,
I used my standard coping tools.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.637
There is nothing standard about
what you endured,

02:39.681 --> 02:41.117
Warrant Officer
Perry.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.466
Tell me
about the other prisoner.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.817
Zied.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.167
A good man.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.995
Did you betray
Zied at any time?

02:50.039 --> 02:52.650
Never.

02:52.694 --> 02:53.956
And there was nothing
I could've...

02:53.999 --> 02:56.698
There was nothing I could've
done to save him.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.047
What did
you and Zied talk about

02:58.090 --> 02:59.875
when you were
alone together?

02:59.918 --> 03:02.573
Uh, we didn't talk much.

03:02.617 --> 03:03.661
When can I get back
with my team?

03:03.705 --> 03:04.749
In due time, Mr. Perry.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.751
Not my decision.

03:06.795 --> 03:09.101
There are many
factors to consider.

03:09.145 --> 03:11.713
There are many factors
-to consider.
-Right.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.847
Well, I never did think
that you and I would be

03:15.891 --> 03:19.634
sitting under the stars
like this again.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.157
Yeah, you know, Ray's ordeal,

03:21.201 --> 03:25.901
just, was a good reminder
of what really counts.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.425
The universe works
in mysterious ways, huh?

03:28.469 --> 03:30.601
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

03:30.645 --> 03:34.649
But you, me, a sleeping bag
that ain't meant for sleeping,

03:34.692 --> 03:37.129
I will take it.

03:37.173 --> 03:40.002
Even though we're
courting disaster again?

03:40.045 --> 03:42.134
We're being careful.
All right? We're using

03:42.178 --> 03:44.789
the Unabomber's backyard for
our little romantic rendezvous.

03:49.664 --> 03:53.450
Another wrong move
and our careers are...

03:53.494 --> 03:55.887
Well, we'll just adjust
and navigate.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.675
Seriously? Why?

04:00.718 --> 04:02.503
I-I don't know why a stripper's
calling me right now.

04:02.546 --> 04:03.852
-Okay.
-I really don't.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.203
Hello?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.553
Oh, no. Okay.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.860
Uh, can somebody else
grab him, please?

04:11.903 --> 04:15.646
All right, we're, uh,
we'll be right there. Thank you.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.518
-What's going on?
-Uh, Thirty Mike is drunk

04:17.561 --> 04:21.739
at the jiggle joint and,
uh, he needs a lifeline.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.004
The brotherhood calls.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.832
I'll drive.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.486
Please do.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.837
What do you think the universe
is trying to tell us now?

04:32.881 --> 04:36.232
Mm... Let's go.

04:38.887 --> 04:41.193
Come on. Come on.
Hop on here.

04:41.237 --> 04:44.196
Oh, you left me in the
dust that last mile.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.286
-Sorry about that.
-Oh.

04:46.329 --> 04:49.811
Polly called, wants us
to barbecue on Saturday.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.247
Oh, right.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.684
Polly. Polly-- Who's Polly?

04:53.728 --> 04:55.077
We can head over there
after we stop by

04:55.120 --> 04:56.296
Clive's birthday party.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.819
I got a better idea.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.212
Why don't we grab Cerby,
get in the car,

05:00.256 --> 05:02.824
head to Rehoboth,
get some tequila.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.782
M... Jump on some rooftops.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.262
Yeah, yeah, uh,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.003
considering I'm turning in
my final report next week,

05:08.046 --> 05:09.874
I'm not sure
that's the best idea.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.223
I think
it's a great idea.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.008
I mean, look,
Lindell gave you

05:13.051 --> 05:16.141
the contract extension, right?
So you're good.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.318
This report's gonna
benefit operators.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.015
I can't shortchange it.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.973
Besides, I have
not agreed

05:22.017 --> 05:23.671
to Lindell's deal yet.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.891
Oh, you haven't?

05:26.935 --> 05:28.240
My old boss in San Diego
keeps sweetening

05:28.284 --> 05:29.764
the offer to come back.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.854
He's offering me more...
more access to subjects,

05:32.897 --> 05:34.334
more of my own research staff,

05:34.377 --> 05:36.858
more of everything that I need
to make an impact.

05:36.901 --> 05:41.123
Oh, I mean, look, it's good
to know you make an impact.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.692
-Wow.
-So after all that,

05:44.735 --> 05:46.911
then, uh, yeah, back on Bravo.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.913
Wow-- Thank you.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.611
Yeah, no, I mean,

05:50.654 --> 05:53.788
I-I tracked the story
about Ambassador Marsden.

05:53.831 --> 05:56.704
I was proud of you
for doing the right thing.

05:56.747 --> 05:57.922
Door-kicker with a heart
of gold.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.315
I'm glad to see
that hasn't changed.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.927
You saying something else has?

06:02.971 --> 06:05.843
-Like what?
-I don't know.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.105
By the looks of it,

06:07.149 --> 06:08.977
your shirt's, like,
a size smaller, but...

06:09.020 --> 06:10.370
Quit deflecting. What?

06:12.110 --> 06:13.634
You really think I've changed?

06:13.677 --> 06:15.244
I seem to remember that there
was a pair of Italian shoes

06:15.287 --> 06:17.681
that didn't really
seem appropriate

06:17.725 --> 06:19.944
-for door-kicking.
-Okay, well...

06:19.988 --> 06:22.599
I'm, uh, back to wearing
my trusty Chippewas, so...

06:22.643 --> 06:24.296
You know what?
I don't really think

06:24.340 --> 06:26.124
it's fair for you
to hold those shoes against me,

06:26.168 --> 06:27.299
seeing as you only

06:27.343 --> 06:29.258
spotted them
when you ambushed me.

06:29.301 --> 06:33.044
I do believe
I've apologized for that.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.264
Okay. It was a mistake

06:35.307 --> 06:37.353
showing up unannounced
and pouring my heart out

06:37.397 --> 06:39.224
when you were in a relationship.
Okay? There.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.183
-A mistake?
-Mm-hmm.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.185
Are romantic gestures

06:43.228 --> 06:46.014
on the cancel culture checklist?

06:49.670 --> 06:51.323
Is your girlfriend good
with the change of footwear?

06:51.367 --> 06:53.238
I mean, I would've
asked her personally

06:53.282 --> 06:56.111
when I saw you at Naima's,
but-but you were solo.

06:58.374 --> 07:01.203
Actually, we, uh, we broke up.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.032
She was great, but...

07:04.075 --> 07:06.208
I'm seeing someone right now.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.822
Glad you found another reason
to stay in Virginia.

07:11.866 --> 07:14.390
Uh...

07:14.434 --> 07:16.958
You chose another woman, so...

07:17.001 --> 07:18.133
Didn't have to worry about her

07:18.176 --> 07:19.351
breaking up with me
on the tarmac.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.706
Sorry.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.751
I get it.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.884
No, it's old habits.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.453
That's the thing, though,
isn't it?

07:33.496 --> 07:35.933
We are an old habit.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.676
I've been working really hard to
embrace what's in front of me,

07:39.720 --> 07:41.765
you know, rather than
look backward.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.161
"If you're not evolving,
then you're falling behind."

07:46.204 --> 07:48.380
Isn't that one
of your frog-isms?

07:50.905 --> 07:52.080
Are we still friends?

07:52.123 --> 07:54.082
Still friends.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.610
These are the cages
for Bravo Team.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.830
When a Green Teamer shows up,
we assign him a cage.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.396
Yeah, I thought about
-going to BUD/
-S.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.051
Putting it on the line all the
time for the greater good.

08:07.095 --> 08:09.053
No greater honor.

08:09.097 --> 08:10.838
Seems pretty damn fun, too.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.404
When a Bravo member
leaves, w... Is it true

08:12.448 --> 08:14.929
about that op in Syria,
Master Chief?

08:14.972 --> 08:16.931
You know, these
guys rescued a SEAL

08:16.974 --> 08:18.846
right before
he got executed?

08:20.848 --> 08:22.719
Might have heard
something about that.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.242
You do anything that badass
before you traded

08:24.286 --> 08:26.767
door-kicking for tour-guiding?

08:28.899 --> 08:31.423
I'm just a guy
in the Ops Center now.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.990
Roger that.

08:39.127 --> 08:40.911
Okay, that's
what I'm talking about.

08:40.955 --> 08:42.870
Firing on all cylinders
out there.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.959
Yeah, never thought I'd say it,
but it feels like we got

08:45.002 --> 08:49.790
that magic back with Bravo,
yeah, even without Jason.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.401
Not to mention we've got
The In-Clay-dible Hulk

08:52.444 --> 08:54.446
rolling with us again.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.100
Can you imagine how much we're
gonna be crushing once we got

08:56.144 --> 08:57.275
-the whole lineup back?
Say what?

08:57.319 --> 08:59.713
Whoa!
Hey, come on.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.149
Whole band's back
together now.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.368
Eh, just a, uh,
social visit, boys.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.892
You still haven't
been cleared hot?

09:04.935 --> 09:07.503
Not yet. Intel officers,
Agency folk,

09:07.547 --> 09:09.200
doctors, headshrinkers,
they've been probing me

09:09.244 --> 09:10.941
in places I didn't know existed.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.291
Fingers crossed, I'll be
back soon though, right?

09:13.335 --> 09:14.945
Hey. Never got to thank you

09:14.989 --> 09:17.295
for that emergency
-pickup last night.
Oh, yeah.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.820
Don't mention it. You know,
uh, I've had my fair share

09:19.863 --> 09:21.299
of wild nights there.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.867
Yeah. How come Davis
was with you?

09:23.911 --> 09:25.956
Was there a party
I wasn't invited to?

09:26.000 --> 09:29.873
No, we were just, uh,
closing down at the Bulkhead,

09:29.917 --> 09:31.962
you know, w-when you called
from the club.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.312
You know, needed
-a designated driver.
-Yeah.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.793
-Oh, G.
-I. Jason...

09:36.837 --> 09:38.316
Oh, ooh, ooh!...is back,

09:38.360 --> 09:40.144
with his new piece.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.450
Look at that.

09:41.493 --> 09:42.973
Yeah, that's really funny, huh?

09:43.017 --> 09:45.323
Mocking me 'cause I traded in
my gun for my radio.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.977
What, you don't think
I'm not pulling my weight

09:47.021 --> 09:48.152
from the Ops Center?

09:48.196 --> 09:50.328
Man, we're...
we're just playing.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.026
The Ops Center saves
our asses all the time.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.505
Yeah, and we haven't
seen you around much

09:53.549 --> 09:55.203
so I just figured, you know,
poke your under-luggage

09:55.246 --> 09:56.900
a little bit just
to let you know

09:56.944 --> 09:58.380
we miss you.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.555
I think you're reading
this wrong, brother.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.122
Gentlemen.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.254
DEVGRU's executive officer
is stepping down.

10:03.298 --> 10:06.214
Lieutenant Commander Blackburn
is now commander select

10:06.257 --> 10:07.998
effective immediately.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.174
Oh, nice.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.916
About time.
New duties
permitting,

10:12.960 --> 10:16.006
I'll be aiding in the turnover
process of my replacement,

10:16.050 --> 10:18.530
Lieutenant Soto.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.228
I'm honored to have
the opportunity

10:20.271 --> 10:22.186
to lead Bravo
into the future.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.634
XO's a big job.

10:34.677 --> 10:38.333
Nearly eaten your way to
the top of DEVGRU's food chain.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.858
Seems like I was just
loading into this cage

10:41.902 --> 10:42.990
and now I'm shoving off.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.472
Look at this guy.
Look at him!

10:47.516 --> 10:49.953
Man, I remember this guy
when he first showed up.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.042
Yeah. Thought I could win
the war on terror

10:52.086 --> 10:53.914
on my own back then.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.306
And now?

10:55.350 --> 10:56.612
Well, even though my battle's
on a new front,

10:56.656 --> 11:00.529
I'll get up each day
and do my part.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.836
Listen, uh, Bravo Team has, um,

11:02.879 --> 11:05.665
had some big changes
come their way lately.

11:05.708 --> 11:06.796
And, uh,

11:06.840 --> 11:09.625
you have been
one of the finest officers

11:09.669 --> 11:12.541
to lead that team since
I've been under command.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.936
They're gonna miss you.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.330
I'd like to think that,
but, you know,

11:19.374 --> 11:21.332
if they can move on
from the great Jason Hayes,

11:21.376 --> 11:22.682
they can move on from me.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.380
Won't be as easy
for me, though.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.991
Hell, commanding Bravo, it's...

11:28.035 --> 11:30.690
it's been my identity.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.692
Wasn't my choice
like it was yours.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.738
Just hope I can adapt
as quickly as you have.

11:39.568 --> 11:40.917
Oh.

11:40.961 --> 11:43.006
-Hope I'm not rushing you out.
Nah, man.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.878
Cage is all yours.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.010
Thanks for the help, Jace.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.142
Hey. There you go.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.019
You know, it's a...

11:56.063 --> 11:58.761
shame to have just missed out
on the Jason Hayes era.

11:58.805 --> 12:02.460
Your reputation
precedes you.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.985
I did my part for my team
and my country,

12:05.028 --> 12:06.682
like everyone else.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.032
Maybe someday
we'll fight the war together

12:09.076 --> 12:10.860
from the virtual foxhole
of the Ops Center.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.470
Right.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.605
You know, you look
that far ahead, sir...

12:17.954 --> 12:20.565
...you're gonna lose sight
of what matters.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.445
Hey.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.926
Wondering
when we can

12:32.969 --> 12:36.799
cash that rain check
for our little campout.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.932
Sonny, I heard Thirty asking you

12:38.975 --> 12:41.586
why we were together last night
in front of everybody.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.458
He's got a memory like
a goldfish.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.460
-Don't-don't worry about it.
-We messed up.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.420
Us even having this conversation
at work, it's reckless.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.596
No one's here, Davis.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.816
Okay? You know?

12:53.860 --> 12:56.427
Us, kind of sneaking around,
keepin' it fresh.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.821
Soto's gonna want
to size up the team,

12:58.865 --> 13:00.475
watch everybody like a hawk.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.785
He hasn't been with Bravo
for five minutes

13:05.828 --> 13:07.917
and the newbie's already
chapping my ass.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.484
Issue isn't Soto.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.920
The issue is us.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.531
So we're back here already?

13:14.837 --> 13:16.230
Why you gotta be
so paranoid, Davis?

13:18.362 --> 13:19.755
Davis.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.845
Okay.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.586
I'll be right there.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.588
Lindell wants to see me.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.852
Who's paranoid now?

13:41.429 --> 13:43.561
Come on in.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.347
Lieutenant Davis.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.566
You wanted to see me, sir?

13:50.612 --> 13:52.396
You've attracted
a lot of attention lately.

13:55.356 --> 13:59.186
SOCOM took note of your exploits
rescuing Warrant Officer Perry,

13:59.229 --> 14:01.231
and they want you
to give a presentation

14:01.275 --> 14:02.667
on lateral thinking

14:02.711 --> 14:04.321
in intel processing

14:04.365 --> 14:06.541
at their upcoming conference
in Tampa.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.630
I was just doing my job, sir.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.547
You pulled another
rabbit out of the hat,

14:12.590 --> 14:15.506
and this command and country
owe you our gratitude.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.726
And I wish that all my officers

14:17.769 --> 14:20.424
were as dedicated
and principled as you.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.731
SOCOM needs
an answer.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.211
What'll it be?

14:24.254 --> 14:26.387
Yes, of course, I'll do it.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.302
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.223
All right,
Captain Lindell's roped

14:36.266 --> 14:37.528
Lieutenant Davis
into an assignment,

14:37.572 --> 14:39.574
so you'll be rolling
without her on this one.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.881
I'm gonna have to monitor
Sonny's separation anxiety.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.926
You'll be
spinning up to Ecuador

14:43.970 --> 14:46.407
as straps
on an Alpha Team op

14:46.450 --> 14:49.889
to recover a cache
of Russian MANPADS.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.934
I didn't think
I was gonna have to wear those

14:51.978 --> 14:53.240
till I was 70.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.328
If your bladder runs
like your mouth,

14:54.371 --> 14:55.329
you're gonna need 'em now.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.985
These are handheld

14:59.028 --> 15:00.900
surface-to-air missiles capable
of taking down airliners,

15:00.943 --> 15:02.553
so focus up.

15:02.597 --> 15:05.730
Intel indicates
the MANPADS are being sold

15:05.774 --> 15:07.428
to a faction of Hezbollah.

15:07.471 --> 15:08.603
Our mission is to
recover the missiles,

15:08.646 --> 15:09.778
take down
the players.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.823
Stand by for
more details.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.477
Hey. No Jace, no Ray.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.349
It's gonna be up to us
to tag team this op.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.482
I'll be rolling out
with you guys.

15:18.526 --> 15:19.919
No better way
to get to know my team.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.365
Master Chief, you sort
out the cage assignments

15:31.408 --> 15:33.019
for the incoming
Green Team class?

15:33.062 --> 15:35.369
The new yeoman is taking care
of it; he's up to speed, sir.

15:35.412 --> 15:37.023
Good.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.590
It's hard to believe I just did
my last mission brief for Bravo.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.464
What do you mean?
They're spinning up?

15:43.507 --> 15:44.856
Yeah.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.815
Lieutenant Soto's headed out
in the field with them.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.512
It's a new era.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.478
Still got it, brother.

16:41.522 --> 16:42.697
Never lost it.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.050
Thought you went cold
turkey on shooting

16:48.094 --> 16:49.530
when you stopped
operating.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.358
You know, I'm just
clearing my head, Ray.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.360
All right?
Doing what I love to do.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.883
Or are you sharking

16:54.926 --> 16:56.363
because Bravo's spun up
for the first time

16:56.406 --> 16:57.625
since you left the team?

17:03.587 --> 17:06.764
All right, Mr. Smart-ass.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.375
Before Tunisia,

17:08.418 --> 17:10.551
all you could talk about
was how you missed your family.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.770
So why aren't you
with them now?

17:12.814 --> 17:14.642
Look, man.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.600
I'm just staying sharp
for when I'm cleared hot again.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.080
Mm-hmm.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.517
Itching to get back out there
and crush some skulls.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.390
Oh-ho. Look at that, huh?

17:23.433 --> 17:26.480
Prime Time is back.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.048
Hey.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.398
You feel comfortable
about, uh,

17:31.441 --> 17:33.878
talking about
your captivity over there?

17:35.619 --> 17:38.405
You know, the brass and the
shrinks have got me talked out.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.623
Yeah.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.408
I'm just ready
to move forward, man.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.670
I can't have an impact

17:42.713 --> 17:43.845
if I'm left out
of the damn fight, right?

17:43.888 --> 17:45.586
Yeah.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.631
I get it.

17:47.675 --> 17:52.636
Hey, um... you know what,
Naima has been on me

17:52.680 --> 17:54.856
to invite you and
Natalie over for dinner

17:54.899 --> 17:56.988
to thank you; something
about saving my life.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.425
That's not necessary, Ray.

17:58.468 --> 17:59.904
-You want to tell her no?
-Well...

17:59.948 --> 18:00.992
that's a good point.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.864
So I can expect you when?

18:02.907 --> 18:03.952
I-I don't know.
Whenever.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.214
I'm not going anywhere.

18:22.492 --> 18:23.841
What we got here, man?

18:23.885 --> 18:26.192
Oh. Isn't that sweet?

18:26.235 --> 18:29.151
I've seen

18:29.195 --> 18:30.631
<i>Love Island in
Vah Beach.</i>

18:30.674 --> 18:32.676
Ain't nobody want
to see a reboot.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.070
Not gonna get one.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.986
-Stella's got a boyfriend.
-Mm-hmm.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.640
We're just friends.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.816
No, you're just
a couple of dumbass magnets

18:41.859 --> 18:43.557
that can't seem
to resist each other.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.169
-What do you make of Soto?
-Soto?

18:47.213 --> 18:49.171
Well, he's your
typical millennial

18:49.215 --> 18:50.868
that thinks
he invented the wheel

18:50.912 --> 18:54.220
but he don't know how
to change a tire.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.483
Yeah.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.746
Heading outside the wire
with a chaperone's

18:58.789 --> 19:00.835
-gonna be a change, huh?
-Yeah, well,
the great thing

19:00.878 --> 19:02.097
about Blackburn,
he'd just sit back

19:02.141 --> 19:04.491
and let us do our thing.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.057
Well, something tells me

19:06.101 --> 19:08.059
that Soto isn't really
the "sit back" type.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.626
Oh, no.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.934
Well, I better, uh...

19:12.977 --> 19:15.110
organize my gear.

19:18.722 --> 19:21.203
He always this frosty
with newcomers

19:21.247 --> 19:23.684
or is it
special for me?

19:23.727 --> 19:25.860
No, he, uh...

19:25.903 --> 19:29.211
Social graces skip a generation
or two in the Quinn family.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.779
Don't take it
personally.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.129
Nothing makes an operator
more unsettled than change.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.698
I know I need
to earn the team's trust.

19:37.741 --> 19:39.787
Apparently, Sonny's most of all.

19:39.830 --> 19:42.659
Yeah, well,
when the bullets start flying,

19:42.703 --> 19:45.053
there's nobody else you'd rather
have by your side than him.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.621
That's good to know.

19:47.664 --> 19:50.537
Though he's not the Bravo member
I've got my eye on.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.669
Word is you've got

19:52.713 --> 19:54.584
a penchant to go rogue
and buck rules.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.590
I took my lumps and
learned my lesson.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.245
Yeah, it's all
behind me now.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.682
Well, given how
I want my team to run,

20:05.726 --> 20:07.249
it's not behind me.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.120
In my eyes,
you're still on probation,

20:09.164 --> 20:10.861
so walk the line,
Spenser.

20:10.905 --> 20:13.734
I'm not the only one
with something to prove here.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.613
Havoc, this is Echo 1.

20:23.657 --> 20:24.962
I pass jackpot.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.268
Break. Target secure.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.618
-I say again, target secure.
Yes!

20:28.662 --> 20:31.055
Congratulations,
Master Chief.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.709
After three months of hard work,

20:32.753 --> 20:34.233
you've just helped take down one
of the most wanted men in Yemen.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.973
Well, boots on the ground,

20:36.017 --> 20:37.801
they deserve
all the credit, sir. I...

20:39.847 --> 20:40.935
Wounded Eagle! Wounded Eagle!

20:40.978 --> 20:42.589
Who's hit?

20:42.632 --> 20:43.938
Who's down?

20:43.981 --> 20:45.635
Master Chief,

20:45.679 --> 20:47.071
the operators on the ground
will handle their teammate.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.250
There's nothing you
can do from here.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.174
All right, guys, bring it in.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.959
Handoff location for the MANPADS

21:05.002 --> 21:06.700
has been identified
as this farmhouse

21:06.743 --> 21:08.092
in the foothills
outside of Lluzhapa.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.703
Alpha's already on the ground.

21:09.746 --> 21:11.879
They'll be on lead assault
to recover the missiles,

21:11.922 --> 21:14.795
Bravo will secure the perimeter
and run squirter patrol.

21:14.838 --> 21:18.146
Our HVT is Cipriano Mota.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.366
A gunrunner on the most wanted
list who's been dealing arms

21:20.409 --> 21:22.368
in the Northern Triangle
for the past decade.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.370
Our LZ is five klicks out.

21:24.413 --> 21:27.677
Offset infil, foot patrol in
along these hills, set up

21:27.721 --> 21:30.158
a skirmish line just north
of the target on this ridge.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.334
Excuse me, Lieutenant,
I was, uh, just curious

21:32.378 --> 21:33.988
on how many deployments

21:34.031 --> 21:35.337
you might have
under that belt of yours?

21:35.381 --> 21:38.993
Four-- three CENTCOM,
one PACCOM.

21:39.036 --> 21:41.256
Then STA-21,
Naval Science Institute.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.823
Okay.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.651
Any more questions
about my service record?

21:44.694 --> 21:47.001
Good. I'm aware
my accolades

21:47.044 --> 21:49.220
don't match up to Bravo Team's.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.353
But I'm also aware

21:51.397 --> 21:53.877
many of the operators
who earned them aren't here.

21:53.921 --> 21:56.184
It's a new day and a
new Bravo, gentlemen.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.366
Okay, all right,
easy, easy, easy.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.021
Just relax, okay?
It's a little too loud in here.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.198
That's the first time you've
missed our morning run.

22:10.241 --> 22:12.374
Might not
be my last.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.682
Just not, uh, feeling too well,
called in sick.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.727
Could that be because you don't
like being in the Ops Center

22:17.771 --> 22:19.207
with Bravo outside the wire?

22:19.250 --> 22:21.862
Does she grill you like this
when you go on your run?

22:23.298 --> 22:25.909
You know, maybe
Rehoboth is a good idea.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.346
I like it--
taking some time off

22:27.389 --> 22:29.391
after I turn in my report,
we could get away then.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.438
Ah, I really don't think
vacation's gonna change the fact

22:32.481 --> 22:34.701
that I used to be
an asset to my team

22:34.744 --> 22:36.398
and my country, and now
I'm just riding a desk.

22:36.442 --> 22:40.228
Would training
the next generation of SEALs

22:40.271 --> 22:42.926
help you feel like an asset?

22:42.970 --> 22:45.320
What, Green Team or something?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.366
-Or BUD/
-S.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.413
My old boss sweetened
the offer again,

22:51.457 --> 22:55.025
and I would be crazy
not to consider it.

22:55.069 --> 22:58.942
Be an easy yes
with you on board.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.771
-San Diego.
-Yeah.

23:01.815 --> 23:04.078
You'd still have
the beach.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.776
You always said you loved
living there before DEVGRU.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.214
Kids are gone,
Bravo's in your rearview.

23:10.258 --> 23:13.783
A fresh start might
be just what you need.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.985
Alpha's standing by.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.291
We'll set our skirmish line
along this ridge.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.467
There's a gully 300 meters west.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.513
We'll extend the line
in that direction.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.906
We move that far out,
we lose line of sight.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.561
Line of sight is less important
than a hole in the defense.

23:52.605 --> 23:53.954
Don't
have the bodies for it.

23:53.997 --> 23:56.609
No, Sonny's right.
Securing the gully

23:56.652 --> 23:58.915
denies enemy access
past the ridge.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.831
The line of sight issue is
mitigated by our ATAKs.

24:01.875 --> 24:05.444
Yes, sir.
Then we extend the line.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.575
Bravo 6...

24:06.619 --> 24:09.404
low man covers
the gully.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.450
Move out!

24:17.325 --> 24:18.979
The house is beautiful.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.197
I love the crown molding.

24:20.241 --> 24:22.112
Oh, that was all Ray.

24:22.156 --> 24:23.505
He didn't like how
the contractors installed it,

24:23.549 --> 24:26.465
so he took it down
and did it over.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.728
Wow, didn't know that, uh,
Ray was such a Mr. Fix-it.

24:30.338 --> 24:33.297
I'm used to him crawling
the walls in his downtime,

24:33.341 --> 24:36.126
but he's been more of a
caged tiger than usual.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.999
Oh, that's because "operators
weren't meant to stay

24:39.042 --> 24:40.435
on the sidelines."

24:40.479 --> 24:42.219
Every team guy
I've ever rehabbed

24:42.263 --> 24:44.526
has given me
some version of that.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.485
Which is why I need you
to use your sway with Lindell

24:46.528 --> 24:48.356
to get me back in the game.

24:48.399 --> 24:51.098
I don't think my opinion carries
much weight with him right now.

24:51.141 --> 24:54.405
Hey, how have you been feeling
since you've been back?

24:54.449 --> 24:56.233
Your hands were
in pretty bad shape.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.931
Good as new.

24:57.974 --> 25:00.194
-I don't pay them any attention.
You been sleeping?

25:00.237 --> 25:01.630
Yeah.
No.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.724
Uh, so why is it you feel

25:08.768 --> 25:11.292
like you don't have any pull
with Lindell anymore?

25:11.335 --> 25:12.641
I thought you were
his pride and joy.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.730
I was and, uh, then

25:14.774 --> 25:17.341
I accepted a job in San Diego.

25:17.385 --> 25:19.996
You're leaving us?

25:20.040 --> 25:21.432
What's that mean for you two?

25:21.476 --> 25:23.434
Jason's thinking
about coming with me.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.611
Yeah.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.395
You're leaving Command?

25:28.396 --> 25:30.441
What about Mikey and Emma?

25:30.485 --> 25:33.009
Kids will be fine.
You know, it's easy to...

25:33.053 --> 25:36.317
get a ticket for them to come
on down and see us in San Diego.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.188
San Diego?

25:38.232 --> 25:40.669
Don't tell me you're thinking
-about reentering BUD/
-S,

25:40.713 --> 25:42.018
doing the frogman
cycle all over again.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.367
You're not too far off.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.370
Ah.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.372
Jason Hayes,

25:48.416 --> 25:49.678
-BUD/
-S instructor.

25:49.722 --> 25:53.726
God help those young
tadpoles.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.641
Look, change of scenery
will do me good.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.643
I do believe that's the first
time I've heard you use

25:57.686 --> 26:00.471
"change" and "good" in
the same sentence, Jace.

26:01.472 --> 26:03.213
What bug's in your britches?

26:03.257 --> 26:04.563
Soto told me that

26:04.606 --> 26:06.695
I'm still on probation
as far as he's concerned.

26:06.739 --> 26:10.046
Well, you want to be back
on Bravo, ain't that enough?

26:10.090 --> 26:12.222
Yeah, I just, I'd kind of
figured that I'd have a little

26:12.266 --> 26:14.224
more say around here, especially
without Jason and Ray.

26:14.268 --> 26:15.574
Yeah.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.618
You're not evolving,

26:16.662 --> 26:17.706
then you're falling behind.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.447
Being the low man

26:19.490 --> 26:21.275
on the totem pole
ain't that bad.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.625
Kicking doors in, having fun,

26:23.669 --> 26:26.585
less politics-- life was simpler

26:26.628 --> 26:29.196
back then.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.372
The deeper you go...

26:31.415 --> 26:33.200
the more complicated it gets.

26:33.243 --> 26:36.246
You just keep
treading water and...

26:36.290 --> 26:38.422
it all works out.

26:38.466 --> 26:41.295
Yeah, you tread enough water,
eventually you drown.

26:41.338 --> 26:42.731
Yeah.

26:42.775 --> 26:45.255
You go enjoy that hole, new guy.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.742
You know, Ray, I wasn't gonna
say anything inside in front

26:53.786 --> 26:56.484
of Naima, but you used
to brag all the time

26:56.527 --> 26:59.705
how you could just
sleep at peace like a baby

26:59.748 --> 27:02.229
and nothing
would bother you.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.448
Why you staring
at the ceiling?

27:06.407 --> 27:08.627
I'm just sick and tired
of everybody making

27:08.670 --> 27:10.585
such a big deal
about my captivity.

27:14.545 --> 27:17.461
Well, you know...

27:17.505 --> 27:20.551
firing hard at the range...
not sleeping,

27:20.595 --> 27:23.554
playing <i>Property Brothers
here at home, I...</i>

27:23.598 --> 27:25.600
Who's the one
sharking now?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.428
I'll get back to being myself

27:27.471 --> 27:29.299
once I'm back
in the sandbox again.

27:29.343 --> 27:31.911
If people understood
what we've been through...

27:34.348 --> 27:36.655
...they'd also
understand that...

27:36.698 --> 27:39.396
we need to stay in the fight.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.702
If people knew what
we've been through,

27:40.746 --> 27:42.443
there'd be no more war.

27:42.486 --> 27:45.402
You know, senators and judges,

27:45.446 --> 27:46.795
they serve their country
into their 80s,

27:46.839 --> 27:48.667
we call them heroes.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.538
But warriors, we want
to keep serving the best way

27:50.581 --> 27:53.715
we know how, people
act like we're addicts.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.761
You know,
when you got blown up,

27:55.804 --> 27:58.502
I went to Lindell
and I demanded

27:58.546 --> 28:00.504
to go back on the teams.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.898
He thought I'd fallen
off the wagon.

28:02.942 --> 28:05.771
He was like, "Hayes, you just,
you're regressing!"

28:05.814 --> 28:07.860
That guy.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.297
Yeah.

28:10.340 --> 28:13.343
So...

28:13.387 --> 28:16.172
is moving to San Diego
your way of...

28:16.216 --> 28:18.392
trying not to relapse again?

28:19.654 --> 28:22.613
You know,
seeing the boys, uh,

28:22.657 --> 28:25.791
spin up yesterday just got me
thinking, you know, that I quit

28:25.834 --> 28:27.531
the one job...

28:27.575 --> 28:29.708
the one job that I ever loved.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.231
Being a SEAL.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.711
SEALs never quit.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.278
No, you didn't quit.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.848
You earned the right
to put yourself first.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.415
That's what you did.

28:43.983 --> 28:46.768
You know, Ray, I'm just
realizing more and more

28:46.812 --> 28:48.944
as time goes by
that I'm just

28:48.988 --> 28:50.859
more at home

28:50.903 --> 28:52.774
in a war zone.

28:55.429 --> 28:57.648
Warriors...

28:57.692 --> 29:01.391
they weren't meant
to survive the battlefield.

29:01.435 --> 29:03.611
Ops Center not cutting it
for you?

29:05.265 --> 29:07.484
Ah, my skills...

29:07.528 --> 29:09.573
aren't helping
in there, but,

29:09.617 --> 29:10.923
you know...

29:10.966 --> 29:12.838
And training our future frogmen,

29:12.881 --> 29:16.015
that'll make you feel like
you're still having an impact?

29:18.757 --> 29:21.368
Look, Jace,

29:21.411 --> 29:23.674
I... I have no doubt

29:23.718 --> 29:25.676
that you'd be a great gatekeeper

29:25.720 --> 29:29.506
-at BUD/
-S, but
I got to ask.

29:29.550 --> 29:32.596
Are you running toward something
you think you want,

29:32.640 --> 29:34.773
or away from something
that you don't?

29:55.837 --> 29:58.318
Alpha 1, this is Bravo 1.
We're set.

29:58.361 --> 30:01.060
Roger that. Stand by, Bravo.

30:02.888 --> 30:05.412
Execute, execute, execute!

30:17.816 --> 30:19.948
Squirters coming
your way, Bravo.

30:19.992 --> 30:22.342
Looks like three Tangos.

30:27.303 --> 30:29.131
I've got three squirters
100 meters out

30:29.175 --> 30:30.437
at three o'clock--
all armed.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.960
I've got eyes on them, too.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.100
One squirter down, two at large.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.406
Bravo 5, Tango 70 meters south.

30:43.450 --> 30:44.843
Send in the hair missile.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.279
Stellen!

30:54.069 --> 30:56.376
Pepper, oust! Oust, here.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.900
<i>Platz.</i> Good girl.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.305
Bravo 1, no joy on HVT here.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.838
No HVT here, either.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.884
Our target's still at large.

31:29.278 --> 31:33.543
Bravo 6, any movement
west of the gully? Over.

31:33.587 --> 31:37.330
Negative. Don't have eyes on...

32:12.582 --> 32:15.324
Bravo 1, this is 6.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.500
HVT secured.

32:17.544 --> 32:19.328
I've got Mota.

32:22.592 --> 32:24.986
Alpha didn't recover
the MANPADS on target.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.554
But Bravo handled our
business by snagging Mota.

32:27.597 --> 32:30.949
Agency is confident our HVT will
spill where they're heading.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.124
Good collar, Spenser.

32:32.167 --> 32:35.214
Not bad for Bravo 6, huh?

32:35.257 --> 32:37.956
We land at Vah Beach at 1400.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.958
At 1600 I need you
front and center

32:40.001 --> 32:42.395
for Blackburn's promotion
ceremony.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.616
-Hey, Sonny.
-Yes, sir?

32:48.096 --> 32:49.402
Would've missed our HVT
if not for your call

32:49.445 --> 32:50.925
on extending the line.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.318
The team needs more
of that from you.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.407
Yeah, being the brains
of the operation

32:54.450 --> 32:57.323
isn't really my thing, you know.

32:57.366 --> 33:01.022
I like my knuckle-dragger ways.
Simple but effective.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.155
Simple is safe.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.331
But you joined the teams 'cause
you like a challenge, right?

33:05.374 --> 33:07.376
Yes, sir.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.685
-See you out there.
-All right.

33:11.728 --> 33:14.949
Tonight we're yarding out
two former Bravo members,

33:14.993 --> 33:17.169
-Jason Hayes and Eric Blackburn.
-Right over there.

33:17.212 --> 33:20.302
Hey, guys.
To Commander Blackburn...

33:22.087 --> 33:24.480
May your new job be less
of a pain in the ass

33:24.524 --> 33:26.221
than leading this crew
of door-kickers.

33:27.396 --> 33:30.138
And to Master Chief Hayes,
my brother,

33:30.182 --> 33:33.359
my friend,

33:33.402 --> 33:36.579
here's hoping you find a way
to make an impact after Bravo.

33:38.233 --> 33:41.280
Anything you want to
share with the boys?

33:41.323 --> 33:44.065
No, I've made too many boring
speeches in this bar already.

33:44.109 --> 33:47.286
It's all past. Go ahead,
Blackburn. You're up.

33:47.329 --> 33:50.115
All right.
Listen up.

33:50.158 --> 33:51.986
Listen up!

33:52.030 --> 33:54.206
It's been an absolute honor

33:54.249 --> 33:58.079
leading a group who always
raise their hands first

33:58.123 --> 34:00.081
when it comes time
to run into the fire.

34:01.691 --> 34:05.086
And while no one wants
to talk about it,

34:05.130 --> 34:07.132
our mission is far from over.

34:08.742 --> 34:11.092
But I intend to keep
doing my part

34:11.136 --> 34:13.007
fighting for
the greater good.

34:13.051 --> 34:17.142
And, uh, on a personal note...

34:17.185 --> 34:19.448
Bravo Team will
always be my family.

34:19.492 --> 34:20.623
Hear, hear.

34:20.667 --> 34:23.365
Hear, hear.
Cheers.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.498
-All right.
-But we'd have nothing
to cheers with here.

34:25.541 --> 34:27.413
I would hate to, uh,

34:27.456 --> 34:30.372
see you guys go,
but before we do...

34:30.416 --> 34:33.506
you gentlemen need to yard out!

34:33.549 --> 34:35.334
Yard out!

34:37.466 --> 34:40.643
♪ I got to go, but my friend
can stick around ♪

34:40.687 --> 34:43.342
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug...

34:43.385 --> 34:45.779
♪ Take a load off, Fanny

34:45.822 --> 34:49.696
♪ Take a load for free

34:49.739 --> 34:53.787
♪ Take a load off, Fanny

34:53.830 --> 34:58.748
♪ And, and, and you put
the load right on me... ♪

35:02.535 --> 35:05.538
With Blackburn
and Jason gone,

35:05.581 --> 35:08.193
team's gonna need Bravo 2
back in action with them.

35:09.716 --> 35:12.153
From your lips
to the brass's ears.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.807
I cannot wait
to get back to work,

35:13.850 --> 35:16.549
put this last month behind me.

35:16.592 --> 35:18.420
Um...

35:18.464 --> 35:21.423
Say, you know the prisoner
I was held captive with?

35:21.467 --> 35:22.642
Zied?

35:22.685 --> 35:24.383
Of course.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.431
With your intel access,
do you think maybe

35:29.475 --> 35:32.782
you could his family in Tunisia?

35:32.826 --> 35:34.610
They probably have no idea
what happened to him.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.569
I'd like
to tell them.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.353
Get some closure.

35:38.397 --> 35:40.138
I'll see what I can do.

35:41.226 --> 35:42.488
-Appreciate you.
-Mm-hmm.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.241
Hey, Davis.

35:56.284 --> 35:57.633
Davis, hold up.

35:57.677 --> 36:01.028
Look, I'm-I'm sorry about
what I said the other day.

36:01.071 --> 36:03.204
Okay? A-And you're right.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.597
Okay? We just need
to be more careful.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.773
We need to be more than careful.

36:06.816 --> 36:10.124
I don't want it to end the
same way it did before.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.821
Okay? And...

36:11.865 --> 36:14.128
Isn't the hard part
supposed to be

36:14.172 --> 36:17.131
trying to finding the person
you want to be with,

36:17.175 --> 36:21.179
not figuring out
how to make it work?

36:21.222 --> 36:23.224
It just, I don't know, it
just doesn't seem fair to us.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.747
But I don't want to put
our careers on the line

36:24.791 --> 36:26.445
if you're not up
to the challenge.

36:26.488 --> 36:28.664
Oh, great.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.841
Strippers calling you again?

36:31.885 --> 36:34.279
Uh, no. Uh-- no,
it's complicated. Uh...

36:34.322 --> 36:37.282
Yeah, and Sonny likes simple.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.893
I get it,
but that's never gonna be us.

36:39.936 --> 36:44.289
That was my friend Hannah from
Texas and-and we go way back.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.465
But when I
was in Texas,

36:46.508 --> 36:49.294
well, we kind of, you know, we--

36:49.337 --> 36:51.383
we became more
-than friends.
-Okay. Okay.

36:51.426 --> 36:54.473
Davis, I ignored her call

36:54.516 --> 36:57.258
because this conversation
right here

36:57.302 --> 36:59.173
is so much more important to me.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.654
Yeah, look, I-I...

37:01.697 --> 37:03.308
I prefer simple,

37:03.351 --> 37:04.918
but I tell you what,

37:04.961 --> 37:08.704
no matter
how complicated it gets,

37:08.748 --> 37:11.925
I will walk through fire to make
it work with you, Davis.

37:11.968 --> 37:15.668
Together.

37:15.711 --> 37:19.846
If we decide to make this real,
one of us needs to leave Bravo.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.327
Well, there's a lot of changes

37:22.370 --> 37:25.286
happening in Bravo right now.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.897
I could consider
going to another team.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.907
Command asked me to present
at the SOCOM conference.

37:41.563 --> 37:44.218
-That could open up some doors.
-Yeah?

37:44.262 --> 37:46.307
Present some good opportunities
for me.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.874
Opportunities? You sure
-that's what you want?
-Yeah.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.571
Right now,
the only thing

37:49.615 --> 37:53.706
I know I want is to finish up
that camping trip.

37:53.749 --> 37:55.925
Yeah.

37:55.969 --> 37:59.320
Been a while since
you closed this place down.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.844
Yeah. How was the op
with Soto? How was it?

38:01.888 --> 38:04.325
It's gonna be
a tough transition.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.849
Lot of that going around here.

38:06.893 --> 38:09.678
Well, he essentially told me
that I'm back to new guy status.

38:09.722 --> 38:12.290
New guy? It's all right,
man, I mean, look,

38:12.333 --> 38:15.336
you're back on Bravo, so you're
doing what you're meant to do,

38:15.380 --> 38:16.685
and, uh, that's all
that matters.

38:16.729 --> 38:18.470
Yeah, it is.

38:18.513 --> 38:20.341
But I can't help feeling
like I'm...

38:20.385 --> 38:22.169
like I'm starting over,
you know?

38:24.389 --> 38:25.477
Well, you know what?

38:25.520 --> 38:28.131
You were the new guy
first time around.

38:28.175 --> 38:29.350
Wasn't so bad, huh?

38:29.394 --> 38:33.746
First year was
one of the best, actually.

38:33.789 --> 38:36.705
-Both in and out of the sandbox.
-Mm-hmm.

38:38.098 --> 38:40.056
Well, maybe,

38:40.100 --> 38:42.058
maybe you're not regressing

38:42.102 --> 38:45.758
if you're returning
to something that you love.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.593
Okay, okay.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.249
Hi.

39:42.292 --> 39:44.207
-Did I wake you?
-No.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.688
No, no, some maniac
knocking on my door did.

39:49.256 --> 39:51.345
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?

39:51.389 --> 39:53.434
I, uh, I just,
I wanted to let you know

39:53.478 --> 39:54.566
that maybe you're right.

39:54.609 --> 39:57.351
And m-maybe I did
change after you.

39:59.614 --> 40:02.835
I realized that I wanted
a lot more out of life.

40:02.878 --> 40:05.359
O-Okay, you know, this whole
"we weren't great" speech

40:05.403 --> 40:06.882
could've been put in a text.

40:06.926 --> 40:09.319
Going to STA-21, dating
a Washington insider,

40:09.363 --> 40:11.191
the Italian shoes, m-maybe
those were all just outlets

40:11.234 --> 40:12.671
to help me move on from you.

40:12.714 --> 40:15.456
A-And I'm really glad
that you have those.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.632
I actually have my own outlets
to move on.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.156
One is inside right no... But the thing is,

40:20.200 --> 40:22.376
I realize that m-maybe
I wasn't moving on.

40:23.769 --> 40:26.424
You know, m-maybe
I was running away.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.644
Running away from what?

40:29.688 --> 40:32.691
The fact I still love you.

40:35.737 --> 40:39.219
Okay, I guess that's not
a text-appropriate statement.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.351
Uh...

40:41.395 --> 40:43.484
I don't know what to say.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.703
That's a first.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.666
I just needed you to know.

41:02.198 --> 41:04.374
Last time
you brought a book.

41:06.551 --> 41:09.815
And, uh, and flowers.

41:11.599 --> 41:13.601
Maybe you're the one
that's intent

41:13.645 --> 41:15.864
on canceling romantic gestures.

41:18.867 --> 41:22.392
Well, I was kind of hoping
that I would suffice.

41:24.699 --> 41:26.571
You do.

41:55.469 --> 41:57.427
Been expecting you
to walk in here

41:57.471 --> 42:00.213
since I learned I'm losing
Natalie to San Diego.

42:00.256 --> 42:01.562
I suppose you're
about to tell me

42:01.606 --> 42:03.477
I need to find
a new ops chief?

42:03.521 --> 42:06.393
Sir, I've identified the one job
that makes me want to get up

42:06.436 --> 42:07.786
in the morning.

42:07.829 --> 42:09.439
And what job is that?

42:09.483 --> 42:11.616
Being Bravo 1 again.
