00:05.173 --> 00:08.476
- You know, that was broken
the first time you checked it.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.577
- How is it midnight

00:09.610 --> 00:13.381
and still 100 degrees out?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.415
[sighs]

00:17.385 --> 00:18.552
What are you looking at?

00:18.586 --> 00:20.454
- Nothing.
- Come on.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.524
- [laughs] It's a dating app.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.293
My friend signed me up
when we were drunk.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.427
- [laughs]

00:26.460 --> 00:29.230
Well, I'm off men entirely

00:29.263 --> 00:30.264
for six months--

00:30.298 --> 00:31.365
self-imposed.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.135
- Why?

00:34.168 --> 00:37.371
- I dated, um, you know,
within the department.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.473
And, um...

00:39.507 --> 00:42.310
It's a bad idea.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.644
- Who?

00:43.677 --> 00:45.279
- No, no way.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.547
I have already said too much.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.649
- Fine, but I got 100 bucks

00:48.682 --> 00:50.318
that say you don't make it
more than 30 days.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.385
- Pfft, you are on.

00:51.419 --> 00:55.223
This is, like, the easiest money
I ever made, Tay.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.558
- Was it Detective Dawson?

00:57.591 --> 00:58.692
- No.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.161
- 'Cause, you know,

01:00.194 --> 01:03.297
he's got something going on.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.266
- Agreed, but no.

- [over radio]
Units in 21,

01:06.434 --> 01:08.402

[panting]

02:22.676 --> 02:25.579
- You all right?
- Been better.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.481
You all right?
- Yeah.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.458
- Thought I told you
not to chase a black kid

02:37.491 --> 02:38.792
unless his shoes ain't tied.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.394
- [chuckles]

02:40.428 --> 02:42.396
- To what do we owe
the pleasure, Kevin?

02:42.430 --> 02:44.698
- Well, we executed
a warrant over on 41st,

02:44.732 --> 02:46.400
clocking that overtime.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.602
- We heard you guys caught
that call over the zone.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.272
We figured we'd stop by,
see if you need any backup.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.207
- Yeah, check it out.

[radio crackles]

0, George, 9,
king, queen, 2, 2.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.982
- Do we know if anyone
reported it stolen?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.050
- Not sure.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.818
We just rolled up,
and it was being picked apart.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.987
But the kid I chased
dropped this.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.623
It's Murphy, Sarah.
Female, white, 24.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.692
Address says Northbrook.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.694
- 2113, you should
be looking at a car

03:13.727 --> 03:15.696
registered to a Sarah Murphy.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.399
1116 Pine Ridge, Northbrook.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.700
- We got fresh blood.

[radio crackles]
- 10-4. Hold us down.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.404
- Copy that, 2113.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.006
- Huh...
Where's Cinderella?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.575
- Help!

03:27.608 --> 03:28.776
Police!

03:28.809 --> 03:30.444
There's a white boy
on my back porch

03:30.478 --> 03:32.012
that look almost dead!
- Where?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.647
- Right back here!
Right back here!

03:37.785 --> 03:39.553

03:39.587 --> 03:40.688
- I'll call 911.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.258
- He's got a pulse.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.459
- This is Detective
Jay Halstead,

03:45.493 --> 03:47.695
badge number 51163,
CPD Intelligence.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.830
Roll an ambo
to 4245 South Laramie.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.332
- Whoa. Wait, wait.
Careful.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.533
It could be vertebrae damage.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.368
- [whispering]
Right, right, right.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.838
- What do you got, Kev?

03:57.871 --> 04:00.608
- Nathan Ward,
same address as

04:00.641 --> 04:02.776
that car registered
to Northbrook.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.482
- What do you got?

04:08.516 --> 04:10.684
- Patient has suffered
severe blunt force trauma,

04:10.718 --> 04:12.620
possible hematoma,
severe lacerations to the scalp.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.588
- All right, put him
in Trauma 2.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.490
Had 13 shot just tonight--
3 DOAs.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.591
This is just what I needed.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.392
- It's the heat.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.827
- At the very least,
he'll need multiple sutures

04:20.861 --> 04:22.330
and a CT scan.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.364
Check back in a few hours.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.365
- Yeah, we will.
Thanks.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.699
- Dr. Choi?
- Yeah.

04:25.733 --> 04:26.867
- So what do you think
we got?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.437
A carjacking gone bad?

A/C went out in my

04:51.692 --> 04:53.894
It's like Dante's "Inferno"
in there.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.863
- Yeah, which circle of hell?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.431
- All of them.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.902
- How are things?

05:01.935 --> 05:03.404
- Great.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.041
[A/C unit humming]

05:08.075 --> 05:10.010
- Okay, who's up?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.912
- All right, Nathan Ward,
24 years old.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.414
He's an engineering student.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.616
His fiancÃ©e, Sarah Murphy,
also 24.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.518
She's a special needs
teacher in Northbrook.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.521
Now, they have no priors,
no convictions, no arrests.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.022
Between the two of them,
they don't even have

05:22.055 --> 05:22.990
a moving violation.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.125
- We put out a missing persons
alert for Sarah.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.428
In the meantime, Kot signed off
on the emergency order

05:27.461 --> 05:29.430
for her cell phone, so Mouse
is trying to ping it right now.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.631
- Yeah, what about
the car's GPS?

05:30.664 --> 05:31.632
- That's gonna be a while.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.433
The guy at the tech lab

05:32.466 --> 05:34.001
was bitching about
lack of manpower.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.135
I'm gonna stay on him.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.470
- But what if it wasn't
a carjacking?

05:36.504 --> 05:37.671
I mean, maybe they just
wanted to score.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.039
The car was three blocks
away from 290--

05:39.072 --> 05:40.574
that's the heroin highway.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.476
- Yeah, but dealers
don't assault their customers.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.111
Suburbanites are their
bread and butter.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.413
- Yeah, and we didn't
find any drugs

05:45.446 --> 05:46.614
or "paraphenalia" in the car.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.616
- "Paraphernalia."
There's an R in there.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.083
A lot of people miss it.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.652
- Okay, "Hooked on Phonics."

05:51.685 --> 05:52.720
You want to step outside?

05:52.753 --> 05:54.154
- Let's go.
[laughter]

05:54.187 --> 05:56.524
- 60. 60!

05:56.557 --> 06:00.060
That's how many shootings
we've had this week--

06:00.093 --> 06:03.030
12 of them fatal.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.933
I'm not gonna worry about
political correctness here

06:05.966 --> 06:07.935
or my own convictions.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.638
What we have
is a white woman missing

06:10.671 --> 06:13.140
in the heart
of the black ghetto.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.142
We're gonna assume the worst:
she's been abducted.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.043
[phone rings]

06:16.076 --> 06:19.046
So do what you need to do
to find her.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.450
Just do it carefully.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.652
Chicago already has enough
of a PR nightmare.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.787
- Uh, it's Dr. Choi.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.055
Sarah Murphy's parents

06:28.088 --> 06:29.623
are with Nathan down at Med.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.091
- You and Jay.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.526
Come on, you heard
the commander.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.727
Get to work.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.429
- Sergeant.
- Ma'am.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.465
- When I say be careful,
I mean it.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.067
There's a lot of eyes on
the police right now.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.602
- Look, I'm not
running for mayor.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.604
If this was a black girl
missing on the North Side,

06:43.637 --> 06:45.739
I'd go about it the same way
I'm about to right now.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.614
- So my loan went through.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.086
The place is great, you know?

06:59.119 --> 07:01.489
Two-bedroom.
Washer, dryer.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.990
Underground parking.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.463
I asked you a week ago;
you said you'd think

07:09.497 --> 07:11.098
about moving in,
so what's the deal?

07:11.131 --> 07:13.701
- Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.238
- Just come check it out.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.774
It's got a gym;
it's got a whole club level

07:20.808 --> 07:23.043
with, like, a coffee lounge
and all this stuff.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.678
Well, I haven't really
checked it out yet, but--

07:24.712 --> 07:27.715
- No, it's not that.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.717
I want you to move in with me,

07:29.750 --> 07:32.586
in my place.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.154
Look,
I already have a mortgage.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.824
If we double up, we could
pay it off in five years.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.733
Jay, I'm completely
in love with you.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.037
And you are the only person
that I can trust right now,

07:50.070 --> 07:53.073
so if you're down,

07:53.106 --> 07:55.108
please just say you're down.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.512
- I'm down.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.620
- [clears throat softly]

08:08.155 --> 08:09.857
- When's the last time
you saw your daughter?

08:09.890 --> 08:12.125
- Sarah and Nathan--
they surprised us

08:12.159 --> 08:13.861
with dinner at The Drake
last night

08:13.894 --> 08:16.296
for our 25th anniversary.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.298
Ate and had some champagne,

08:18.331 --> 08:19.900
and then they headed back
for home.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.102
- About what time was that?

08:22.135 --> 08:24.304
- It was about midnight.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.139
They both had to work
in the morning.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.108
- Okay, and you two
stayed at the hotel?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.810
- It's where we had
our honeymoon.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.715
- CT scan showed Nathan
suffered cranial bruising

08:34.748 --> 08:36.283
and some hemorrhaging.
- [gasps]

08:36.316 --> 08:38.284
- We have him in the ICU
and packed his brain with ice

08:38.318 --> 08:39.653
until the swelling goes down.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.321
I know it sounds bad,
but luckily,

08:41.354 --> 08:43.691
Nathan didn't suffer
any serious brain damage.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.860
- Thanks, doc.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.228
- Sure.
- Thank you.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.633
- Has anyone spoken
with Nathan's parents?

08:52.666 --> 08:53.701
- They're in Florida,

08:53.734 --> 08:56.336
catching the first
flight they can.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.806
- Mr. and Mrs. Murphy,
can either of you

08:58.839 --> 09:00.708
think of any reason

09:00.741 --> 09:03.110
that Sarah and Nathan
would go into South Austin?

09:03.143 --> 09:06.346
- [panting] Why are you
asking me questions

09:06.379 --> 09:08.682
when you should be out
looking for my daughter?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.918
- Sir, we have a hundred cops
in the street

09:10.951 --> 09:12.753
looking for her right now.

09:12.786 --> 09:16.223
We are doing
everything we can.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.860
- Please, bring
my little girl home.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.371
- Thanks for coming down.
Listen up.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.273
Okay, we're looking
for Sarah Murphy.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.708
Female, white.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.710
She's been missing 12 hours.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.713
I want every lot,
every backyard searched.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.649
I mean, you see anything
that doesn't look right,

09:41.682 --> 09:43.984
you call it in.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.719
I know right now,
a lot of you are thinking

09:45.753 --> 09:48.722
it's us versus them--
it's not, okay?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.624
I don't want you to buy into
any of that crap

09:50.658 --> 09:52.225
you see on the news.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.327
There's a lot of good people
in this neighborhood

09:54.361 --> 09:56.329
who don't see us
as the enemy.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.832
Just clear your heads
of all that nonsense

09:58.866 --> 10:01.268
and do your job.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.703
Now let's go.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.743
- Guys, do me a favor.
Come on.

10:09.777 --> 10:10.878
Just take one more look.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.713
A girl like this--hey.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.215
She can't be too hard to spot
in this neighborhood.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.984
- Any idea where
she might be, fellas?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.822
- We look like
neighborhood watch to you?

10:21.855 --> 10:24.758
I don't even know where
my own girl is half the time.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.660
[light laughter]

10:26.694 --> 10:28.428
- Come on, Smiley.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.363
You run this whole
demonstration, bro.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.700
You mean to tell me
that you want CPD

10:32.733 --> 10:34.367
jamming you up
over this little girl?

10:34.401 --> 10:35.368
- That-a girl!

10:35.402 --> 10:38.371
That's how you get a rebound!

10:38.405 --> 10:40.874
Young black kids out here
dying every day.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.710
But the CPD bring out
the cavalry

10:42.743 --> 10:43.911
for that one white girl.

10:43.944 --> 10:47.915
- Yeah, we got a job
to do, Smiley.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.383
Just like you do.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.219
That's Velvet, right?
- Mm-hmm.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.787
- How old is she now?
About 11?

10:53.821 --> 10:55.222
- Just turned 12.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.992
- I'm just saying, man,
if something were to happen

10:59.026 --> 11:00.794
to Velvet, I'm pretty sure
you would want somebody

11:00.828 --> 11:02.395
to step up and say
something, right?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.768
- Brother, you know
you can't buy me.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.970
And I ain't
no CI snitch bitch.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.807
- I understand, but those hoops
need some new nets, bro.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.015
[knocks softly]

11:26.920 --> 11:28.756
- If a car look like
it's been picked clean,

11:28.789 --> 11:31.324
I'd check Loo's Liquor
over on 15th and Laramie.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.360
If anybody's got
anything to flip,

11:33.393 --> 11:35.362
it goes through Loo.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.463
- My dog.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.906
- Chicago PD.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.008
- It's top dollar.
- It's worth at least 2 bills.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.309
- Hey!
- Nah, little man--

11:49.342 --> 11:50.844
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.
- Hey, come on, Loo.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.913
- Come on, man!
- Hands on your head, bro.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.917
Uh-uh.
Hey, little homie,

11:56.950 --> 11:58.118
where'd you find this phone?

11:58.151 --> 11:59.386
- Found it in the street.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.453
- Yeah, how old are you?

12:00.487 --> 12:01.454
- 15.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.322
- 15?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.091
All right, right now
you are looking at

12:04.124 --> 12:05.325
attempted murder...

12:05.358 --> 12:06.526
- Kidnapping too.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.328
- Kidnapping.
So what do you think, Kev?

12:08.361 --> 12:10.898
Like, be about 45 by the time
you get out of Stateville

12:10.931 --> 12:12.399
unless you start
telling the truth.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.134
- Listen, man--
- Hey, not "man."

12:14.167 --> 12:16.937
Look at me. I'm not here
to sell you ice cream.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.471
You need to understand
the seriousness

12:18.505 --> 12:20.507
of your situation.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.509
- I found it in that car,
Officer.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.877
- Okay, hey,

12:23.911 --> 12:25.779
don't lie to me.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.414
Do you know
what happened to this girl?

12:27.447 --> 12:28.949
Keep it real.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.117
- No.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.519
The dude she was with--

12:32.552 --> 12:35.522
seen him down the block
talking to Hudson.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.324
- Okay, who's Hudson?

12:39.459 --> 12:41.128
All right, this is
Michael Hudson.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.031
He's 22 years old, a lieutenant
of the West Side Hustlers.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.066
This guy's got priors
for possession,

12:46.099 --> 12:48.068
assault, resisting arrest.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.871
He and his crew operate out of
the foreclosed house over there.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.040
I called the board-up company
and got the lock code,

12:53.073 --> 12:54.574
so we're all set to go, boss.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.575
- Let's go.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.578

13:15.128 --> 13:16.596
[hip-hop music playing
over stereo]

13:16.629 --> 13:17.931
- Hands up.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.399
Get on your knees!

13:21.101 --> 13:24.371
- Where's Hudson?

13:24.404 --> 13:25.839
- In the bathroom.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.943
- Nobody move.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.511
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.612
[crashing]

13:32.645 --> 13:34.514
- Police! Don't move!
Don't move!

13:34.547 --> 13:36.483
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.056
[TV playing indistinctly]

13:43.090 --> 13:45.192
- Where's Sarah Murphy?

13:45.225 --> 13:46.493
Where is she?

13:46.526 --> 13:47.594
- Who?

13:47.627 --> 13:52.532
*

13:52.565 --> 13:54.501
- What about him?
You seen him?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.136
Huh?

13:56.169 --> 13:58.638
- Yeah, I seen that punk.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.141
He was here to buy some H.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.642
Okay?

14:07.147 --> 14:07.280
.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.481
- Michael, with the amount of
heroin we found at your place,

14:09.382 --> 14:12.519
you're looking at
a mandatory ten years.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.622
The thing is, we don't care
about the dope right now.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.525
All we care about is her.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.127
- I could tell you
100 more times--

14:20.160 --> 14:22.362
I don't know where
that white girl is.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.931
- Explain something to me.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.933
I mean, you're a big guy.
Business is booming.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.667
You're moving heavy weight
on the West Side.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.970
- Yo, I never said that.
Don't put that on no report.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.438
- Michael, everything stays
out of the report

14:31.471 --> 14:32.572
if you help us out.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.640
- [sighs wearily]

14:33.673 --> 14:34.741
If you're such a big guy,

14:34.774 --> 14:37.410
why are you playing stick-up man
on a Saturday night?

14:37.444 --> 14:38.645
- Man, I ain't--
[laughs]

14:38.678 --> 14:40.547
I ain't stick nobody up.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.482
I hold my own out here.

14:42.515 --> 14:46.019
- So Nathan Ward comes to score,
and...what?

14:46.053 --> 14:47.154
You rob him?

14:47.187 --> 14:49.056
- Man, he was trying to rob me.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.058
College boy thinks
I'm some ghetto fool

14:51.091 --> 14:53.493
he can rip off with the money
he made on his computer.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.532
Man, he came down last week
and bought five bundles

14:59.566 --> 15:01.568
with that fake-ass paper.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.972
- And you fell for that?
Top dog like you?

15:05.005 --> 15:07.407
- He had some real bills on top.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.942
It looked legit.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.443
And I ain't think
in a million years

15:10.477 --> 15:12.179
a scrubbed-up white boy
like him

15:12.212 --> 15:15.615
would try to run a game
on me.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.017
[exhales]

15:17.050 --> 15:19.386
Shame on me.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.621
First time, anyway.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.490
I had a lock 'n sock
ready for him

15:23.523 --> 15:25.492
as soon as
he came back to cop,

15:25.525 --> 15:27.527
and they always come back.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.563
- So how does
the fiancÃ©e fit in?

15:30.597 --> 15:32.565
- Man, that bitch
ain't ever hit the block.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.201
I swear.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.036
And if she was there,

15:36.069 --> 15:37.437
I ain't see her.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.642
[monitor beeping]

15:43.676 --> 15:46.079
- How's Sarah?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.514
- We don't know.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.982
She's missing.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.187
- What?

15:54.221 --> 15:55.688
- Tell us what you remember.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.027
- We took a shortcut
on the way home

16:00.060 --> 16:01.194
to avoid traffic--

16:01.228 --> 16:02.695
- All right, Nathan,
stop right there.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.564
It was no mistake
you ended up in South Austin.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.665
You were there to buy heroin.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.567
We know that.
- No, I--I--

16:07.600 --> 16:09.002
- The longer you lie to us,

16:09.036 --> 16:10.437
the worse it is
for your fiancÃ©e,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.539
who is out there
scared and alone.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.475
We already know, so just
tell us what happened.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.714
- I left her in the car.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.185
I told her to wait.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.754
She was scared.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.457
Kept asking why we were
stopping there.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.027
I told her it was all good.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.129
I just had to pick up
a package.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.697
- Paid for with
"Monopoly" money,

16:37.730 --> 16:39.166
which, by the way,
it takes balls.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.468
It's also the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

16:43.603 --> 16:48.175
- I-I was jumped,
and after that,

16:48.208 --> 16:50.677
everything's hazy.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.779
- Okay, what about--
- This is your fault!

16:52.812 --> 16:54.281
- Hey, hey!
- Calm down!

16:54.314 --> 16:55.615
Calm down, calm down!

16:55.648 --> 16:57.517
Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.052
- I didn't mean
for this to happen!

16:59.086 --> 17:01.121
- Calm down.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.256
- [sobbing]
Why haven't you found her?

17:04.656 --> 17:06.292
- We will, okay?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.228
We will. We will.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.829
- [sobbing]

17:10.863 --> 17:12.632
- [whispering] I'm sorry.

17:15.535 --> 17:19.106
- Hey, Kim.
- Oh, hey, Adam.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.707
- Staying cool?
- Trying.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.108
- I know, right?
- Right.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.776
- I'll catch you later.
- Bye.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.615
- Is that your ex?

17:28.648 --> 17:30.717
- What? No.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.620
Why would you think that...

17:33.653 --> 17:35.288
Oh.
How did you know that?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.290
- Uh, by the way
he was just looking at you.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.359
Makes me think
I should have wagered more.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.261
- How about the celibacy thing
stays between us?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.096
- Whoa, who is celibate?

17:43.130 --> 17:45.698
You, Burgess?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.700
- I'm focusing on myself
right now, so...

17:47.734 --> 17:49.636
- Because, come here...

17:50.803 --> 17:53.106
Come here.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.109
I can name at least two
detectives, both married,

17:56.143 --> 17:57.577
and a stable's worth
of patrolmen

17:57.610 --> 17:59.179
who have confided in me
their desire

17:59.212 --> 18:03.116
to take you to the futon,
hard.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.317
- Wonderful.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.685
- Yeah.

18:05.718 --> 18:06.819
- Have a good night,
Sergeant.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.321
- Oh, oh, you're not
going anywhere.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.323
You two are officially
in overtime.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.225
I'm turning you around
to South Austin.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.793
Voight needs
all the bodies he can get

18:13.826 --> 18:15.295
to search for this girl.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.567
- Commander.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.642
- Commander Fogel,
how can I help you?

18:29.676 --> 18:30.810
- We got a beef,
you and me?

18:30.843 --> 18:32.345
Something we need
to talk about?

18:32.379 --> 18:33.713
- No, why do you ask?

18:33.746 --> 18:35.682
- You went around me
to get Patrol Officer Tay

18:35.715 --> 18:37.284
reassigned to this district.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.319
- Actually, I went over you.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.256
- See, that's a problem.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.158
- No, sir.
You had a problem.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.626
I tried to fix it.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.262
You stranded a good cop
at a crap detail.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.364
How is it gonna look
when HQ finds out

18:51.398 --> 18:53.166
that you did it
because she rebuffed

18:53.200 --> 18:54.867
your romantic advances,
Commander?

18:54.901 --> 18:57.337
- Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

18:57.370 --> 18:59.806
This is not an open discussion.

18:59.839 --> 19:03.176
Either Patrol Officer Tay
goes back to 26th and Cal,

19:03.210 --> 19:05.845
or I make sure your ass
is off this pine,

19:05.878 --> 19:08.615
hoofing it in the high hundreds
on a foot beat!

19:22.895 --> 19:24.764
- You going on a road trip?

19:24.797 --> 19:26.299
- Uh, Voight, yeah.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.667
He said he wanted me mobile
on the scene.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.735
- I hope it has A/C.

19:28.768 --> 19:29.969
- Jay?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.471
- What's up?

19:31.504 --> 19:32.872
- Hey, man, I just--

19:34.307 --> 19:35.642
Look, just so you know,

19:35.675 --> 19:38.745
I-I've been thinking
about going back in.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.747
- In where?

19:40.780 --> 19:43.350
- The Rangers.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.984
Sergeant Ortiz--
he reached out to me,

19:45.017 --> 19:46.986
said he's putting together
a tactical unit.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.788
They need a comm specialist.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.893
- You're serious?
Are you serious right now?

19:53.926 --> 19:55.262
- I've just been
thinking, man.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.963
What am I gonna do?

19:56.996 --> 19:58.365
Join the academy?

19:58.398 --> 20:00.367
Be a 31-year-old rookie?
Come on.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.868
Over there, I got stripes.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.670
- Do you forget
what it did to you?

20:05.538 --> 20:08.241
Depression?

20:08.275 --> 20:09.876
Can't sleep at night?

20:09.909 --> 20:11.278
You want that?
You want to be--

20:11.311 --> 20:12.912
You want to be calling me
3:00 in the morning?

20:12.945 --> 20:14.347
You can't sleep,
you're popping pills?

20:14.381 --> 20:17.717
- I'll...
I'll learn to deal with it,

20:17.750 --> 20:19.286
just like you did.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.691
- Greg, you're in the middle
of a war in Chicago.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.927
You want a war?
You're right here, okay?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.730
- I'm just being honest, man.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.299
Here, there's just--

20:32.332 --> 20:33.933
just too much noise.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.535
You know, who's right,
and who's wrong?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.304
Over there in Afghanistan,

20:37.337 --> 20:38.538
I know that
I'm the good guy

20:38.571 --> 20:40.239
and they're the bad guys.

20:43.543 --> 20:44.877
- Before you make a decision,

20:44.911 --> 20:46.713
we're gonna talk more
about this.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.294
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.796
- What are you guys doing
this deep on the West Side?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.965
- Just cruising around.
- Oh.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.300
- Where you guys from?

21:07.334 --> 21:08.435
- Palatine.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.303
- Palatine.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.371
Palatine.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.271
- That's a nice area.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.973
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- It's real nice.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.775
- So guys came all the way
from Palatine

21:15.808 --> 21:16.943
to buy some drugs?
Right?

21:16.976 --> 21:18.044
- No.
- No, no, no, no.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.347
No, Officer. We--we were--
just made a wrong turn.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.849
- Yeah, I'll bet you did.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.083
Now, how about
you get back on 290

21:24.116 --> 21:25.852
and never come back here?

21:25.885 --> 21:26.986
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

21:27.019 --> 21:28.521
Okay.
- Yeah.

21:33.593 --> 21:34.827
- [sighs]

21:34.861 --> 21:36.596
- The WGN weather app
just declared today

21:36.629 --> 21:37.997
the hottest day of the year.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.800
- 90% humidity,
100% chance of murder.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.336
- Is that who I think it is?

21:43.370 --> 21:45.405
- What? Are you impersonating
a police officer now?

21:45.438 --> 21:46.873
- What, this--
this is just me--

21:46.906 --> 21:48.107
it's just a precaution.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.509
You know, I know
what neighborhood I'm in.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.444
- Uh-huh.
- What's with the FOP medallion?

21:51.478 --> 21:54.547
- Uh, just showing my support
to the Chicago Police Department

21:54.581 --> 21:57.517
and the sacrifices you brave men
and women make every day.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.385
- Save it.

21:58.418 --> 22:01.421
- Find a different story
to chase, Trent.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.423
- It's all black-on-black
around here.

22:03.456 --> 22:04.891
You know that.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.893
This story
is money on the table.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.896
- Get him out of here.
Make sure he leaves.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.564
- Let's go.

22:13.633 --> 22:14.801
- Sergeant.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.035
- Sir.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.136
- You remember me?

22:17.169 --> 22:18.538
- I don't.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.907
- You arrested my grandson,

22:20.940 --> 22:22.141
October of last year--

22:22.174 --> 22:23.810
Derrick Latham.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.044
- Latham, oh, yeah,
he ran a--

22:25.077 --> 22:26.646
ran a car theft crew.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.015
You got information
on this missing female?

22:29.048 --> 22:31.651
- No, just wanted
to thank you.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.620
Derrick got seven years.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.154
That's time I ain't
got to worry about him

22:35.187 --> 22:36.856
dying in these streets.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.033
[brakes screeching]

22:47.066 --> 22:48.535
- Sergeant.
- What's up?

22:48.568 --> 22:50.670
- Just finished diagnostic
of Sarah Murphy's phone.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.672
Emails, social media,
all the downloaded apps.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.541
Turns out she's wearing
a step tracker.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.543
Now, it's like a watch,
but it's for fitness buffs.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.445
It logs your steps.
- You got a location?

22:58.478 --> 22:59.946
- Now, I hacked the GPS.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.548
Last known location
was at the railyard,

23:01.581 --> 23:02.682
six blocks away.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.983
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

23:06.886 --> 23:07.954
[dog barks]

23:07.987 --> 23:10.056
- Seek, seek.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.625
[dog barking]

23:12.659 --> 23:14.026
- What you got?

23:14.060 --> 23:15.695
- Local kids--
they're always down here,

23:15.728 --> 23:16.796
drinking and screwing,

23:16.829 --> 23:19.432
and we're always having
to chase off the homeless.

23:19.466 --> 23:20.500
- Uh-huh.

23:20.533 --> 23:21.701
- Come on, seek.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.071
[dramatic music]

23:25.104 --> 23:26.573
Seek.

23:26.606 --> 23:33.513
*

23:34.514 --> 23:36.883
[dog barks]
- Got something.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.893
- Chicago PD!

23:46.926 --> 23:48.895
Don't move.
Let me see those hands.

23:48.928 --> 23:49.896
Drop the needle.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.164
[dog barking]

23:52.198 --> 23:54.967
[dog whining]

23:55.001 --> 24:02.008
*

24:36.242 --> 24:36.375
.

24:36.408 --> 24:36.809
- Crime lab, ASAP.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.584
- He ripped her hair
right out like a doll's.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.222
- Hey, you know the drill.

24:50.256 --> 24:53.059
Step by step
until we find her.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.727
- Step by step.

24:57.196 --> 25:00.066
- Told you, man, I'm just
trying to get some medicine,

25:00.099 --> 25:02.301
keep right, and get out
of the heat, all right?

25:02.334 --> 25:05.538
- You seen this girl or anybody
who came down here with her?

25:05.572 --> 25:06.939
- You peel me off
a little reward--

25:06.973 --> 25:08.174
maybe I'll remember
something.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.609
- I don't have time for that.

25:09.642 --> 25:10.577
- Neither do I.

25:13.813 --> 25:16.048
- Uh-huh, excuse me, Officer,
what's his name?

25:16.082 --> 25:17.750
- Chaos.
- Chaos!

25:17.784 --> 25:19.786
I got a witness here that
doesn't seem to understand

25:19.819 --> 25:21.253
the urgency of the matter.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.789
Thought maybe Chaos
could help.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.657
- Yeah.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.058
Press up!
[dog snarling]

25:26.092 --> 25:27.627
- [screaming]
Get him off!

25:27.660 --> 25:29.195
Fine! I'll talk, man!
I'll talk!

25:29.228 --> 25:30.730
Just get him off of me!

25:30.763 --> 25:32.064
Get him off!

25:32.098 --> 25:33.232
Get him off of me!

25:35.067 --> 25:37.269
- Okay, witness describes
a lone offender,

25:37.303 --> 25:39.739
male, black, 6'4" or taller,

25:39.772 --> 25:40.940
driving a black van.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.976
- Supposedly he parked near
the entrance of the rail tunnel,

25:44.010 --> 25:45.978
dragged Sarah inside,
and assaulted her

25:46.012 --> 25:47.614
for approximately 30 minutes.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.716
Afterwards, he put her
back in the van and drove off.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.283
- All right, start running
sex offenders

25:51.317 --> 25:53.085
that fit that description.
- Yes, sir.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.321
- He could've assaulted her
in the van with no witnesses,

25:55.354 --> 25:57.323
so why pull her
into the railyard?

25:57.356 --> 25:59.592
- I don't know. Maybe he didn't
plan on taking her.

25:59.626 --> 26:02.795
I mean, he drags her down
to this tunnel, has his way...

26:02.829 --> 26:04.664
Figures he can keep
the party going.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.098
- Well, at least
there's an upside--

26:06.132 --> 26:07.634
probably still alive.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.781
- Here you go.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.115
- This is just what I needed.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.250
- Thank you.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.385
- My mom says
there's a girl missing.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.255
I hope you find her soon.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.057
- Hey, we will.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.291
Okay?

26:32.324 --> 26:35.327
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:35.361 --> 26:36.763
- Okay, sweetie...

26:38.130 --> 26:39.231
- Yeah,
but what I'm saying is,

26:39.265 --> 26:41.167
is, maybe it's time
to file a complaint.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.802
- Against the commander?
- Yes.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.704
- You know how it looks like
for a female officer

26:44.737 --> 26:46.706
to scream sexual harassment?

26:46.739 --> 26:48.775
I'd be the last in line
for every promotion,

26:48.808 --> 26:51.043
plus I've got
nothing to prove.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.712
It's just my word
against his.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.681
- Me and Platt--we would back
that Fogel's stalking you.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.148
- Okay, look, Kim.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.416
I appreciate you
looking out for me,

26:57.449 --> 26:59.318
but I don't want
any more drama.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.854
I just want
to be a cop again.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.222
[smash]
[brakes screech]

27:03.255 --> 27:04.456
- What the hell?

27:08.327 --> 27:09.696
Which one of you threw that?

27:09.729 --> 27:10.863
- Here come the po-lice.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.198
They about to shoot somebody.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.833
- These are Tasers.
Back off.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.401
- Oh, so the new
and improved police

27:15.434 --> 27:17.303
ain't allowed to shoot nobody?

27:17.336 --> 27:18.705
- I asked you a question.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.740
Which one of you threw that?

27:20.773 --> 27:22.208
- Look, we get it, okay?

27:22.241 --> 27:23.776
You have a problem
with us being here.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.412
But as soon as somebody tells us
where Sarah Murphy is,

27:26.445 --> 27:28.314
we'll be on our way.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.883
- Hey, y'all, she right.

27:30.917 --> 27:32.351
Screw your stop snitchin'.

27:32.384 --> 27:33.720
I got to eat.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.421
We all got to eat.

27:36.923 --> 27:39.792
Hey, I'm Bebe.

27:39.826 --> 27:43.429
Y'all come on through
to my place.

27:43.462 --> 27:46.165
I provide a service,
selling drinks for $2

27:46.198 --> 27:47.433
for when the bars close.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.435
But with all you cops
being around here,

27:49.468 --> 27:52.338
business has dried up.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.340
Screwdrivers, on the house.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.443
- Oh, thank you, but we're
not allowed to drink on duty.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.445
- There's ice in there.

27:59.478 --> 28:02.114
- So there is.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.216
So this morning, you told
the officer you saw something?

28:04.250 --> 28:05.885
- Yeah, it's been so hot,
I've been sleeping

28:05.918 --> 28:07.787
under the window
with the fan blowing.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.856
Last night, I get woke
by this scream.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.758
Look out, look down the block--

28:11.791 --> 28:13.459
see this girl
get pulled from a car.

28:13.492 --> 28:15.227
- You see who were
pulling her out?

28:15.261 --> 28:16.763
- Yeah.
- What'd he look like?

28:16.796 --> 28:17.897
- He was tall.
- Black?

28:17.930 --> 28:19.231
- Black, yeah.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.833
I ain't get a good look
at much else.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.935
Most of the streetlights
around here are busted out.

28:22.969 --> 28:25.337
- Tell him about the other guy--
the white guy.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.505
- Thought he was police.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.174
He was in one of them
undercover cars,

28:28.207 --> 28:29.776
parked right over there,
filming it

28:29.809 --> 28:31.377
on one of them camcorders.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.912
- A white guy was filming?
- Uh-huh.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.346
Thought he was Narcotics.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.848
You know, sometimes
they come around here,

28:35.882 --> 28:37.984
and they film the corner boys
selling dope.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.219
But he ain't say nothing
when that girl was screaming,

28:40.252 --> 28:42.354
so I thought he was
one of them reporters.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.393
- Bobby Trent.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.395
Appreciate it.

28:49.428 --> 28:50.963
[tense music]

28:50.997 --> 28:52.331
[crashing]

28:52.364 --> 28:53.966
- Hey, what the hell?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.970
*

28:58.004 --> 28:59.806
Hey, you got a warrant?

29:01.307 --> 29:02.408
- Where's the video?

29:02.441 --> 29:03.810
- What are you talking about?

29:03.843 --> 29:05.244
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.879
Hey! You seeing this?

29:06.913 --> 29:08.347
Police brutality!

29:08.380 --> 29:09.816
- I don't see nothing.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.918
- Where's the video?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.519
I didn't shoot
the video, okay?

29:13.552 --> 29:15.554
One of my stringers did.
He's a new guy.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.857
He sent the footage over,
like, ten minutes ago. I--

29:17.890 --> 29:20.559
- I said, where is the video?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.962
- It's on the laptop.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.931
[grunts]

29:28.334 --> 29:29.836
I was gonna turn it over
to the police.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.437
I just wanted to get a quote
from the networks first.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.973
- Get out of the car. Come on!
- [screaming]

29:34.006 --> 29:36.542
- Shut up!
- [crying]

29:36.575 --> 29:38.577
[crying continues]

29:38.610 --> 29:39.979
[shrieks]
- Get in the van!

29:40.012 --> 29:41.814
Shut up, bitch!
- [wails]

29:47.486 --> 29:50.489
- Sergeant, I swear I was gonna
turn it over to the police.

29:51.523 --> 29:52.925
[yells]

29:52.959 --> 29:54.526
[groans and winces]

29:57.396 --> 29:59.932
- Hey, man, listen.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.834
You know the violence
you film and shoot

30:01.868 --> 30:04.971
and get off on?

30:05.004 --> 30:07.874
If I ever see you at any
of our crime scenes again,

30:07.907 --> 30:10.943
you're gonna know what
that feels like firsthand.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.078
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

30:30.496 --> 30:30.629
.

30:30.662 --> 30:31.197
- I ran the video footage

30:31.830 --> 30:33.432
through facial recognition.

30:33.465 --> 30:34.566
We got a hit.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.035
Kenneth Waddell,

30:36.068 --> 30:37.403
AKA "Six-Six."

30:37.436 --> 30:40.406
Yes, because he's 6'6" tall.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.574
- Waddell's got priors
for dealing narcotics

30:42.608 --> 30:44.576
when he was a teenager.

30:44.610 --> 30:48.047
And in his 20s, it seems
he switched to sexual assault.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.918
In 2011, he raped
an underage handicapped girl.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.619
Went to Stateville,
did five years,

30:53.652 --> 30:55.454
got paroled two months ago,

30:55.487 --> 30:57.456
and since then, he's been
ostracized in the neighborhood.

30:57.489 --> 30:58.958
Gang units say no local crews

30:58.991 --> 31:00.559
want anything to do
with this guy.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.028
- All right, thank you.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.529
That was Waddell's
parole officer.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.531
Lists his LKA
as his aunt's house

31:05.564 --> 31:07.066
on 17th Place,

31:07.099 --> 31:08.467
but apparently
he's disappeared,

31:08.500 --> 31:09.635
and nobody's seen him
in weeks.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.470
- And Jay and I
ran the partial plate

31:11.503 --> 31:12.604
that we got off the footage.

31:12.638 --> 31:13.805
We got a hit on the black van,

31:13.839 --> 31:17.609
and the temporary tags are
registered to Kenneth Waddell.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.611
- Housing Authority cameras
recorded the van

31:19.645 --> 31:21.280
driving into Beverly Gardens

31:21.313 --> 31:22.915
at 6:00 a.m. this morning.

31:22.949 --> 31:24.416
Never came out.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.086
- Beverly Gardens--
that's a G Park Lord stronghold.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.287
They control every gate
in and out.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.957
- Yeah, I ran Waddell's file,
and neither him nor his family

31:30.990 --> 31:32.324
have an address listed there,

31:32.358 --> 31:33.960
so if he is still in there,

31:33.993 --> 31:35.627
we have no clue
where he's keeping her.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.529
- Well, he could have her
in one of the vacants--

31:37.563 --> 31:38.664
obvious stash spot.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.332
- Yeah, and this ain't
gonna be easy.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.633
I mean, the G Lords,
they don't care

31:41.667 --> 31:43.535
if you're a fireman,
an EMT, a cop.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.972
You got to get permission from
whoever is calling the shots

31:46.005 --> 31:47.673
just to get in there,
and they're gonna have

31:47.706 --> 31:49.708
cats guarding the gates,
spotters on the roof...

31:49.741 --> 31:51.978
- So we need to figure out
a weak point to get inside.

31:52.011 --> 31:56.082
- No, there's no time
to execute a raid.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.017
We go in through
the front door.

32:03.455 --> 32:06.292
[muffled hip-hop music playing]

32:06.325 --> 32:07.994
All right, no one draws
unless they have to.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.561
- Hey, we got 5-0!

32:09.595 --> 32:11.563
[indistinct shouting]

32:11.597 --> 32:12.999
5-0!

32:13.032 --> 32:15.301
*

32:15.334 --> 32:16.635
5-0!

32:16.668 --> 32:17.736
- They here!

32:17.769 --> 32:20.406
[indistinct shouting]

32:20.439 --> 32:22.441
- You know CPD ain't welcome
in the Gardens.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.575
- Not here for you.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.078
Not here for any
of your boys.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.546
We're here for Six-Six.

32:27.579 --> 32:30.016
You know that girl
all over the news,

32:30.049 --> 32:31.517
Sarah Murphy?

32:31.550 --> 32:33.752
He's holding her in here.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.089
And you don't want
to get in my way for him.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.725
- Since he got out, Kenny comes
here all the time for dope.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.694
A customer is a customer,
but he ain't one of us.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.064
But we ain't seen no girl.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.533
If it's true,
we'll handle it.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.168
- No.
It's too late for that.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.037
The Lords had a chance
to handle Waddell

32:51.070 --> 32:53.739
when he was raping
underage girls.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.741
Well, I got a list
of 50 vacants in there.

32:55.774 --> 32:56.875
I can call in SWAT.

32:56.908 --> 33:00.446
They'd be happy to tear
each one up till they find him,

33:00.479 --> 33:02.448
and I got a feeling they're
gonna find a lot more too,

33:02.481 --> 33:03.582
you know what I mean?

33:03.615 --> 33:05.051
So...

33:15.727 --> 33:17.463
- Far as I'm concerned,
he's a sick dog--

33:17.496 --> 33:19.098
should've been put down
on the tier.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.732
- I hear that.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.570
Which building is he in?

33:24.603 --> 33:26.372
- Shootin' gallery.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.607
East wing, fourth floor.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.810
Call it the black hole.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.813
[dramatic music]

33:34.846 --> 33:42.054
*

33:44.090 --> 33:45.157
[phone beeps]

33:45.191 --> 33:47.693
- Two vacants on this floor:
407 and 409.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.629
- Well, these old places
have identical layouts.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.498
You, Ruzek, Atwater--
take 7.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.599
We got 9.

33:53.632 --> 33:54.700
Let's go.

33:54.733 --> 34:01.740
*

34:03.175 --> 34:04.410
Go.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.178
[gunshots]

34:11.550 --> 34:12.618
- Kenny, where is she?

34:12.650 --> 34:13.851
Where is she?

34:13.885 --> 34:16.522
[gunshots,
wood splintering]

34:24.663 --> 34:25.797
- I swear--

34:25.831 --> 34:26.864
I'll kill her!

34:26.898 --> 34:28.634
- [crying]

34:28.667 --> 34:29.868
Please--in here!

34:29.900 --> 34:31.437
- Sarah, we hear you!

34:31.469 --> 34:33.705
- Shut up, bitch!

34:33.739 --> 34:35.674
- [crying]

34:35.706 --> 34:37.708
[screaming]

34:46.784 --> 34:48.654
- Jay, I need you to go

34:48.687 --> 34:49.755
back in the other apartment.

34:49.788 --> 34:50.856
Get in that bedroom.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.591
Let me know when you're there.

34:52.623 --> 34:54.693
[Sarah whimpering, screaming]

34:54.726 --> 34:56.628
Antonio, keep him talking.

34:56.661 --> 34:58.164
- Listen, Kenny.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.831
I give you my word,

34:59.865 --> 35:02.268
you put the gun down,
you walk out of here alive.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.136
- If she ain't...
[indistinct]

35:04.170 --> 35:05.837
- [groaning]

35:05.871 --> 35:07.906
- None of this would've
ever happened.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.476
Just another white whore
looking to get high!

35:15.914 --> 35:16.047
.

35:16.081 --> 35:16.515
- [sobbing] Oh, God!

35:20.352 --> 35:22.254
Please!
- Shut up, bitch!

35:22.288 --> 35:23.922
- Do what's right, Kenny,
and put the gun down.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.691
Let her go.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.593
- Stupid bitch.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.629
- [crying]

35:33.765 --> 35:36.768
[sobbing]

35:41.940 --> 35:43.809
- Jay, in the middle
of the wall,

35:43.842 --> 35:45.644
there's a fuse box.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.517
He's 3 feet to the right.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.651
On my mark...

35:59.791 --> 36:01.560
- Son of a bitch.

36:01.593 --> 36:02.794
Got it.

36:04.796 --> 36:08.634
- You're just gonna
have to kill us both,

36:08.667 --> 36:10.636
'cause I'm dead anyway.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.372
- [sobbing]

36:13.405 --> 36:14.606
[cocks gun]

36:14.640 --> 36:16.375
- Now.

36:16.408 --> 36:17.776
[gunshot]

36:23.014 --> 36:25.817
[Sarah whimpering]

36:28.287 --> 36:29.955
- Detective Dawson to Main.

36:29.988 --> 36:32.591
We need an ambo to
the south side of O block.

36:32.624 --> 36:33.992
- Are you all right?
Are you hit anywhere?

36:34.025 --> 36:34.993
- Copy that.
Ambo on...

36:35.026 --> 36:36.027
- She's free.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.663
- Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.265
You're okay, you're okay.
You're okay.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.367
You're safe. You're safe.
It's okay. It's okay.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.269
- [crying softly]
- It's okay.

36:43.302 --> 36:44.870
It's okay.

36:44.903 --> 36:47.906
[Sarah crying]

36:49.708 --> 36:50.776
- [whispering]
It's okay.

36:50.809 --> 36:53.379
It's okay.
It's okay.

36:53.412 --> 36:56.282
[solemn music]

36:56.315 --> 36:57.716
You're okay.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.351
[whispering]
You're okay.

37:07.826 --> 37:11.663
- Can you please do me a favor?

37:11.697 --> 37:12.898
- Anything.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.803
- Please don't tell
my parents about this.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.308
My dad...

37:28.947 --> 37:31.249
It's just better
that I tell him myself.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.953
- If that's what you want.

37:37.656 --> 37:40.659
- [sobbing]

37:47.433 --> 37:49.000
- I'm ready to dance.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.068
What's up?
- [giggling]

37:50.101 --> 37:51.370
- Ladies.

37:51.403 --> 37:52.871
One last thing.

37:52.904 --> 37:53.972
- That's her bad news voice.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.375
We should've snuck out
the back.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.377
- You're not gonna make us
change back in, are you?

37:58.410 --> 37:59.978
- God, no.
It's beer o'clock.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.647
I'm two steps behind you.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.849
I just wanted to say
good job today.

38:03.882 --> 38:04.883
- Thank you.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.852
- Do you know, I've worked here
for three years,

38:06.885 --> 38:08.954
and that's the fourth time those
words have crossed your lips?

38:08.987 --> 38:11.723
- But who's counting, right?

38:11.757 --> 38:12.891
- Right.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.767
- Sergeant, um,

38:21.800 --> 38:26.004
is everything okay
with Commander Fogel?

38:26.037 --> 38:29.007
- Right as rain.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.342
On your way.

38:40.952 --> 38:42.020
- [exhales]

38:42.053 --> 38:43.822
[tapping on door]
- Sergeant?

38:43.855 --> 38:44.956
- Yeah?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.392
- Sir, do you
have a minute?

38:46.425 --> 38:47.793
- Yeah, sure.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.898
- Well, first off,
I want to thank you, sir,

38:52.931 --> 38:54.099
for giving me this job.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.401
It really--

38:55.434 --> 38:56.902
really helped me
turn my life around

38:56.935 --> 38:58.770
at a time when
I really needed it.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.542
But, sir, I have been
given an opportunity--

39:03.575 --> 39:06.111
an opportunity to rejoin
my old Ranger unit, and I--

39:06.144 --> 39:07.913
I think I should take it.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.115
Now, I know that you think
that I'm probably crazy

39:10.148 --> 39:12.017
and taking a huge risk,
but, sir, I just--

39:12.050 --> 39:14.486
I feel that this is
the right thing for me to do.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.391
- Mouse...

39:19.425 --> 39:22.394
if you're looking to go back
and serve this country,

39:22.428 --> 39:24.095
you don't have to explain
anything to me.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.031
- Well, I'm grateful that
you feel that way, sir,

39:26.064 --> 39:29.067
because, well, I need a favor.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.871
Um, you remember
that I was busted

39:32.904 --> 39:34.973
for that truckload
of stolen Blu-ray players.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.842
Technically,
that is a felony, sir,

39:36.875 --> 39:39.745
and the only way
that I can get back in,

39:39.778 --> 39:41.447
the only way
that I can reenlist,

39:41.480 --> 39:45.917
is if that charge
is expunged or--

39:45.951 --> 39:47.919
or, sir, if it's stated
in writing that

39:47.953 --> 39:49.921
I was working in
an undercover capacity

39:49.955 --> 39:51.957
for your unit.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.962
- So you want me to lie
to back up your lie?

40:00.532 --> 40:02.534
- Well, it's the only way
I'll get back in, sir.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.576
- Okay.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.177
So here's what I think.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.979
Take these posters down,

40:14.012 --> 40:16.848
and we put
a 65-inch flat-screen

40:16.882 --> 40:18.049
right here.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.552
- Those are all signed
by the bands.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.990
- They'll look just as good
over there.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.893
'Cause I have an install guy,
and he's an artiste.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.496
- Oh.
- No wires, nothing.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.998
- Jay...

40:33.031 --> 40:34.500
Easy.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.902
- I know, I can't really, uh--

40:36.935 --> 40:38.904
can't really force
a man cave on you.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.171
- We'll figure it out,

40:40.205 --> 40:42.073
one room at a time.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.510
I'm just glad
you're gonna be here.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.084
- Hey, by the way...

40:55.621 --> 40:57.022
I love you too.

41:01.593 --> 41:04.563
[gentle instrumental music]

41:32.958 --> 41:33.091
