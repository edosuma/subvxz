00:15.322 --> 00:16.489
What are you doing?

00:16.523 --> 00:18.457
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:18.492 --> 00:20.759
Um, my sister's coming.

00:20.794 --> 00:23.295
All right.

00:23.330 --> 00:26.398
The judgmental one or the pretty one?

00:26.433 --> 00:27.900
They're the same sister.

00:27.934 --> 00:29.735
Right, right.

00:29.769 --> 00:33.066
Well, I always liked her.
I think the feeling was mutual,

00:33.091 --> 00:35.034
- so I'm gonna talk you up, girl.
- Yeah?

00:35.059 --> 00:36.486
Yeah, I'm gonna make you look awesome.

00:36.510 --> 00:38.286
Okay, just in case it comes up,

00:38.345 --> 00:39.912
but I'm sure that it won't...

00:39.946 --> 00:42.281
She hates you now.

00:43.316 --> 00:44.916
- She what?
- We gotta go.

00:44.941 --> 00:46.285
Hold on.

00:46.319 --> 00:47.586
What are you talking about?

00:47.621 --> 00:48.988
We gotta go.

00:49.022 --> 00:50.456
Wha... I'm loveable.

00:53.716 --> 00:55.183
Hey, you're gonna miss your bus.

00:55.208 --> 00:57.710
- Who got popped?
- A kid who missed his bus.

00:57.735 --> 00:59.199
Man!

01:05.402 --> 01:08.080
This isn't one of us.
This is Bobby Trent's car.

01:08.105 --> 01:10.476
You know, that sleaze bag videographer.

01:10.510 --> 01:11.644
Yeah.

01:14.347 --> 01:17.060
.22's his, but this is no suicide.

01:17.085 --> 01:19.692
The entry wound is in
the center of his face.

01:19.717 --> 01:21.138
And there's no contact wound.

01:21.163 --> 01:22.331
People don't wanna see it coming.

01:22.355 --> 01:24.557
He's got half a dozen puncture wounds.

01:24.591 --> 01:27.626
Shallow, sporadic. It's overkill.

01:27.661 --> 01:29.575
We talked to one of Bobby's stringers,

01:29.600 --> 01:31.864
who was out here shooting
crime scenes last night.

01:31.898 --> 01:33.732
He didn't know if Bobby was working

01:33.767 --> 01:35.312
but there were
three shootings in the area,

01:35.336 --> 01:37.710
- so he might have been.
- Look, the car's a crime scene.

01:37.735 --> 01:40.306
I don't want anyone else near it
until it's towed.

01:40.340 --> 01:43.446
Hey, you and Ruzek canvas the area.
See if anyone's willing to talk to us.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.946
- Yeah.
- And confirm whether or not

01:44.971 --> 01:47.088
Bobby was working. If he wasn't,
what the hell was he doing here?

01:47.112 --> 01:48.627
Right.

01:48.715 --> 01:50.125
- Yo, Sarge.
- Yeah?

01:50.150 --> 01:52.140
Bobby's daughter was actually
the one who found him.

01:52.164 --> 01:53.986
Her name is Margot.

01:54.020 --> 01:57.656
Says she's not leaving till she
talks to whoever's in charge.

01:59.759 --> 02:01.549
Margot?

02:01.761 --> 02:04.143
Hey, can you give us a minute, please?

02:04.397 --> 02:08.556
Hi, Margot. I'm Sergeant Hank Voight
with the Intelligence unit.

02:08.702 --> 02:10.669
One of my officers said
you wanted to talk to me.

02:10.704 --> 02:13.868
Yeah, um, do you know my dad?

02:14.040 --> 02:16.508
Not well.

02:16.543 --> 02:20.148
Most cops hate
that he films what he films.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.547
They don't think he's worth much.

02:21.581 --> 02:23.805
Listen, your father
was just doing his job.

02:23.830 --> 02:26.408
My job is to find out
what happened to him.

02:28.555 --> 02:30.889
I've been working for him.

02:30.924 --> 02:33.146
This morning, I was logging footage

02:33.171 --> 02:35.325
and I knew something was wrong.

02:35.350 --> 02:37.246
We all share our locations for work.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.714
And he said he was here.

02:38.748 --> 02:40.516
I thought he must be working a scene.

02:40.550 --> 02:43.051
And why'd you know
something must be wrong?

02:43.086 --> 02:45.388
Because I didn't have access.

02:45.822 --> 02:48.657
His computer, our servers...
it was all down.

03:19.255 --> 03:20.756
Clear.

03:24.093 --> 03:25.294
<i>Clear.</i>

03:27.711 --> 03:30.693
Well, someone did not like Bobby Trent.

03:31.717 --> 03:33.418
Everything electronic is destroyed.

03:33.443 --> 03:35.927
There's gonna be nothing left but dust.

03:36.105 --> 03:38.180
I think that's the point.

03:38.298 --> 03:40.275
Somebody wanted everything gone.

03:46.683 --> 03:47.783
Got something.

04:22.842 --> 04:26.177
All we have is a video file.
No audio at all.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.718
They have no idea they're being filmed.

04:33.830 --> 04:35.797
Maybe Bobby got off on this.

04:35.832 --> 04:38.166
Or maybe this is what got him killed.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.488
Bobby Trent, 41 years old.

04:55.513 --> 04:58.293
Was a freelance videographer
at crime scenes.

04:58.318 --> 05:00.686
Sold footage to all
the major news affiliates.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.300
He was found at 6:12 a.m.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.536
Single .22 caliber gunshot to the face.

05:04.570 --> 05:06.638
Ballistics match Bobby's gun.

05:06.672 --> 05:09.474
Estimated time of death between
10:30 and midnight.

05:09.508 --> 05:11.276
The ME thinks
that the seven puncture wounds

05:11.310 --> 05:13.511
to Bobby's chest and stomach
came after the shot.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.490
They're very in depth, but
they're all with the same blade.

05:15.514 --> 05:18.117
Small, shallow. Swiss Army knife,
something similar.

05:18.150 --> 05:20.385
His phone locations show
he left his loft,

05:20.419 --> 05:22.721
drove straight there,
arrived at 10:21 p.m.,

05:22.755 --> 05:24.994
but the closest crime scene
is three blocks away.

05:25.019 --> 05:28.087
And forensics has no trace
evidence to work with.

05:28.112 --> 05:29.661
No prints on the gun. Offender likely

05:29.695 --> 05:32.197
- wore gloves, so...
- We're working backwards.

05:32.231 --> 05:33.365
Yeah, in a very large pool.

05:33.399 --> 05:35.533
I mean, think about it.
Bobby made all of his money

05:35.568 --> 05:38.403
profiting off of death, so
naturally, he racked up enemies.

05:38.437 --> 05:40.672
Victims, victims' families,
news affiliates

05:40.706 --> 05:42.751
- sending him hate mail.
- There's also four ex-wives.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.542
He's not on speaking terms
with any of them.

05:44.577 --> 05:46.829
Five restraining orders filed
in the past two years

05:46.854 --> 05:48.513
and a history of drugs and alcohol.

05:48.554 --> 05:49.821
Speed, cocaine.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.517
He's been in and out of NA for a decade.

05:52.551 --> 05:54.686
Right, and our video?

05:54.720 --> 05:56.750
There's no ID on the woman.
I'm enhancing the footage

05:56.774 --> 05:58.734
to get a better image,
so hopefully we'll get a pop.

05:58.758 --> 06:01.026
The guy, he's a total no go.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.504
He never looks directly at the camera,

06:02.528 --> 06:05.230
he's got no defining characteristics,
as far as I can tell.

06:05.264 --> 06:07.856
Well, every other drive
in Bobby's house was destroyed.

06:07.881 --> 06:09.768
And most of his personal files
are nixed,

06:09.802 --> 06:14.561
but he did back up a lot
of footage on his iCloud.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.442
<i>- Mama!
- Go inside, baby!</i>

06:17.476 --> 06:19.377
<i>- What happened?
- Go inside. I'm okay.</i>

06:19.412 --> 06:21.763
<i>I'm okay, go inside.</i>

06:21.881 --> 06:25.598
<i>- Run, baby, run, go inside.
- No, stop, Mom!</i>

06:25.710 --> 06:27.270
<i>- What happened?
- God.</i>

06:27.356 --> 06:30.476
<i>No, Mama, you can't! Please!</i>

06:30.656 --> 06:32.257
<i>No!</i>

06:37.163 --> 06:38.563
- Hank?
- Yeah?

06:38.597 --> 06:41.599
Um, Margot Trent's here.

06:44.770 --> 06:48.287
Okay, we all know who this guy is.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.404
We all crossed paths with him.

06:50.743 --> 06:54.045
Doesn't matter. He's still a victim
with a kid downstairs.

06:55.147 --> 06:56.681
Lindsay.

06:59.285 --> 07:02.648
No, no, I've never seen her.

07:03.456 --> 07:06.437
You have any idea
why your dad would hide footage?

07:06.859 --> 07:08.687
Had he done that before?

07:08.966 --> 07:11.234
I don't think so.

07:11.464 --> 07:14.137
And would he have a reason to?

07:14.800 --> 07:17.833
He could be paranoid sometimes.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.256
What was he paranoid about?

07:21.674 --> 07:24.014
Maybe paranoid's the wrong word.

07:24.221 --> 07:26.678
He was careful.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.060
What about a girlfriend?

07:28.119 --> 07:30.350
I don't... I don't know.

07:30.649 --> 07:32.125
You never saw him with anybody?

07:32.284 --> 07:35.977
I only just got back in touch
with him six months ago.

07:36.220 --> 07:38.187
If he had a girlfriend,
I wouldn't be the one

07:38.214 --> 07:39.714
to know about it.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.826
- Okay, who would be?
- No one.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.346
He didn't have people like that.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.865
I grew up eight miles from him.

07:46.899 --> 07:51.964
I would send him letters, school
projects, photos, try and call.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.375
He'd FedEx me a present on my birthday.

07:57.020 --> 08:00.689
I was his own daughter,
and I didn't even know him.

08:08.938 --> 08:11.085
Come on.

08:11.683 --> 08:14.418
Excuse me, are you Sergeant Trudy Platt?

08:14.443 --> 08:16.257
Yeah, that's me.

08:16.590 --> 08:19.936
I'm Nicole Silver, Kim Burgess' sister.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.991
I've heard a lot about you.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.963
Well, you know,
Kim... Kim can exaggerate.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.106
I doubt that.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.275
I just wanna thank you.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.711
She always says how much
you taught her, how you helped

08:32.736 --> 08:36.597
her get into Intelligence.
It's just nice to know

08:36.623 --> 08:39.291
that there's someone
looking out for her here.

08:41.386 --> 08:44.926
Sh... she said this?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.794
Yeah.

08:48.261 --> 08:51.691
Well, hey, let me show you upstairs.

08:51.716 --> 08:53.632
- You want some coffee?
- Thanks.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.030
Hey, Burgess, look who's here.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.672
- Hey!
- Hey!

09:00.706 --> 09:02.999
I told you to call me when you got here.

09:03.024 --> 09:05.710
- It was so nice to meet you, Nicole.
- You too.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.479
Have a great day.

09:07.513 --> 09:09.547
Nicole, hey.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.349
How are you?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.385
How you doing?

09:13.419 --> 09:14.519
Hey.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.515
I was...

09:17.189 --> 09:18.490
- It's Adam, remember?
- Yeah.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.525
I last saw you at your
husband's birthday.

09:20.559 --> 09:24.529
I remember you.
I had your engagement photo

09:24.563 --> 09:27.065
pinned to my fridge for eight months.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.343
Let's go get coffee.

09:31.368 --> 09:33.271
- We're gonna get coffee.
- Sure, okay.

09:33.298 --> 09:36.366
So out of all the hate mail
that I ran through

09:36.409 --> 09:39.377
from Bobby's news affiliates,
one popped.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.713
Gangbanger from the West Side
named AJ Hines.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.549
He used to live three blocks
away from where we found Bobby.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.461
I've caught him on two crime
scenes and mouthing off.

09:46.485 --> 09:48.520
All the hate
on social media's pretty loud.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.089
He actually put a hit out on
Bobby on Facebook

09:51.123 --> 09:52.090
like four months ago.

09:52.124 --> 09:53.758
You got an address?

09:53.793 --> 09:57.529
No, he moved, and I can't
confirm the new address, but.

09:57.563 --> 10:01.366
AJHin0300 is snapchatting the
hell out of Michigan Avenue.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.535
Wanna go get him?

10:03.569 --> 10:05.570
- Yes, please.
- Let's do it.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.616
Blue skull cap, right in front of you.

10:23.622 --> 10:25.557
AJ Hines.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.792
What? What you looking for?

10:27.827 --> 10:29.461
I'm looking for you, dawg.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.431
Hey, hey, hey!

10:33.466 --> 10:35.985
5021 Ida, emergency.
Plainclothes officers

10:36.010 --> 10:37.774
in pursuit of an offender. Male, black.

10:37.799 --> 10:38.790
Stop!

10:38.815 --> 10:40.134
- Chicago PD!
- You all right, sir? You all right?

10:40.158 --> 10:42.107
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Security, you got this?

10:42.141 --> 10:43.241
Yeah.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.362
Hey!

10:53.686 --> 10:55.774
AJ, come on, man.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.672
- No!
- I'll get you, I swear.

11:05.378 --> 11:06.812
Hey!

11:21.247 --> 11:23.274
Stay down!

11:25.651 --> 11:28.047
Get your hands up there, yeah.

11:37.480 --> 11:41.116
Whoa, Bobby Trent?

11:41.687 --> 11:43.385
That's why I'm here?

11:44.177 --> 11:46.345
I got zero clue about
what happened to him.

11:46.399 --> 11:47.832
You know, it makes it a lot harder

11:47.860 --> 11:49.694
to believe that when you run.

11:49.728 --> 11:53.331
I ran because I haven't
been paying spousal support.

11:53.365 --> 11:55.199
I ain't about to go to jail

11:55.234 --> 11:58.584
- for that bitch.
- So you had zero clue?

11:58.928 --> 12:01.193
Then how do you explain this?

12:01.631 --> 12:03.508
'Cause on Facebook,

12:04.695 --> 12:06.902
looks like you got
a lot of beef with Bobby Trent.

12:06.936 --> 12:08.637
Hell yeah, we got beef.

12:08.672 --> 12:10.572
It was justified.

12:10.607 --> 12:12.741
Bobby was a vulture,

12:12.783 --> 12:14.678
white guy coming into our neighborhood,

12:14.703 --> 12:16.145
making cash off our dead.

12:16.179 --> 12:19.581
I was doing
a public service checking him.

12:19.616 --> 12:22.584
But that beef's over.

12:22.619 --> 12:23.652
How's that?

12:23.687 --> 12:25.587
I been working with Bobby.

12:25.622 --> 12:28.624
He hired me to shoot the West
Side a couple months ago.

12:28.658 --> 12:31.047
So a little bit of money
and that righteousness just

12:31.072 --> 12:32.649
goes right out the window?

12:32.674 --> 12:36.465
No, I came around
to his way of thinking.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.743
Your neighborhood's going up in flames,

12:38.768 --> 12:41.546
the least you can do
is make the rest of the world

12:41.571 --> 12:43.223
look it in the eye,

12:43.373 --> 12:46.608
and, yeah, the money wasn't bad.

12:46.854 --> 12:48.629
Sarge?

12:52.115 --> 12:56.235
So facial recognition
IDed the woman in the video.

12:56.260 --> 12:57.532
Her name is Sarah Jaines.

12:57.557 --> 12:59.501
She was arrested
a few years ago for trespassing.

12:59.526 --> 13:01.969
- Well, you got an address?
- Yeah, like, 20 of them.

13:01.994 --> 13:04.766
Full name is Sarah Jaines-Huntley.

13:05.295 --> 13:07.229
- Huntley, as in...
- Owns

13:07.263 --> 13:10.149
half of Chicago, Huntley.

13:15.772 --> 13:18.273
I'll notify the Huntleys.

13:18.308 --> 13:20.776
- You can wait in here.
- Thank you.

13:29.919 --> 13:32.120
Are you the police?

13:32.155 --> 13:34.933
You're here about Sarah, aren't you?

13:35.692 --> 13:37.566
Is she dead?

13:37.794 --> 13:40.589
I'm Jessica Huntley.
What's going on here?

13:40.930 --> 13:44.073
I'm Hank Voight.
This is Detective Alvin Olinsky.

13:44.367 --> 13:46.183
We're looking for your daughter, Sarah.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.103
Our daughter doesn't live here anymore.

13:48.137 --> 13:49.238
What's wrong with Sarah?

13:49.272 --> 13:51.006
Just trying to find her.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.941
So where's she living now?

13:52.976 --> 13:54.614
We don't know.

13:55.445 --> 13:56.879
You're gonna have to elaborate.

14:00.950 --> 14:05.056
Sarah's an addict, has been
for a very long time.

14:06.055 --> 14:08.587
Last year, we took
our therapist's advice

14:08.791 --> 14:11.290
- and cut her off.
- Okay.

14:12.028 --> 14:13.406
You know how I can get ahold of her?

14:13.430 --> 14:15.001
No, we have no contact.

14:15.033 --> 14:17.673
Not even a cell phone? Security?

14:17.700 --> 14:19.188
No one's been keeping tabs on her?

14:19.213 --> 14:20.721
We severed all ties.

14:20.746 --> 14:23.048
Tough love, it's what they told us to do.

14:23.073 --> 14:25.173
Do any of you know
a man named Bobby Trent?

14:25.208 --> 14:27.776
No, no, I don't.

14:27.810 --> 14:29.248
Should I?

14:30.046 --> 14:32.014
Is our daughter in trouble?

14:32.248 --> 14:34.883
- We're not sure yet.
- Yes, they are.

14:34.918 --> 14:36.936
She is.

14:42.358 --> 14:44.893
Sarah Jaines-Huntley, 30.

14:44.936 --> 14:47.170
She spent a year at
a very prestigious college,

14:47.196 --> 14:49.686
and then spent a lot of time
in and out of very

14:49.711 --> 14:51.686
expensive rehab facilities.

14:51.711 --> 14:54.937
There is nothing to cross her with Bobby
except maybe the drugs.

14:54.971 --> 14:58.505
This guy has one file hidden
in the middle of his wall,

14:58.530 --> 15:00.349
and it just so happens
to be the daughter

15:00.374 --> 15:02.085
of one of the wealthiest men in Chicago?

15:02.111 --> 15:03.952
My money's on Bobby was stalking her.

15:03.977 --> 15:05.758
He found out who she was.
He started following her.

15:05.782 --> 15:08.083
Well, I am pulling up zero.

15:08.117 --> 15:11.319
There's no current address
for Sarah Huntley or Jaines,

15:11.344 --> 15:12.921
and nothing to date appears online.

15:12.946 --> 15:16.058
There's no social media,
no car, no bank account,

15:16.092 --> 15:18.819
no credit cards. This girl's a ghost.

15:18.844 --> 15:20.006
Thank you very much.

15:20.031 --> 15:22.197
All right, so the last
cell phone that Sarah Jaines

15:22.231 --> 15:25.167
had was cut off six months ago
because of failed payments.

15:25.201 --> 15:27.311
Now, the records show that she
was sticking to Humboldt Park.

15:27.335 --> 15:30.105
The cell was hitting towers
in Humboldt Park every day,

15:30.139 --> 15:32.007
but once a week in Rogers Park.

15:32.041 --> 15:34.776
Rogers Park? Bobby was driving
out there for NA meetings.

15:34.811 --> 15:36.078
Take it.

15:36.112 --> 15:37.412
Yo, Sarge, you got a sec?

15:37.447 --> 15:39.460
Yeah, come on in.

15:40.466 --> 15:41.594
Check this out.

15:41.619 --> 15:44.807
This is the little girl that Bobby
recoded at the crime scene.

15:45.905 --> 15:48.240
<i>My dad said it was 'cause
he had the wrong friends,</i>

15:48.274 --> 15:50.025
<i>but I looked it up.</i>

15:50.143 --> 15:53.278
<i>He was driving some car
when some guy got shot.</i>

15:53.312 --> 15:54.734
Her name is Taja Bowes.

15:54.759 --> 15:56.692
Bobby interviewed her here,
and then again and again.

15:56.716 --> 15:59.217
Right here, she's talking
about losing her mom,

15:59.252 --> 16:02.984
her dad in prison, the neighborhood,
but he's got, like, over 30 hours on it.

16:03.289 --> 16:04.933
I mean, I don't know
if it's gonna mean anything.

16:04.957 --> 16:07.225
- No, it's good, chase it.
- Yeah.

16:07.260 --> 16:09.027
- Good.
- Copy.

16:17.503 --> 16:19.271
Sarah Huntley?

16:22.942 --> 16:24.153
I'm sorry, people you meet here die,

16:24.177 --> 16:28.991
but they don't get killed. I just, um...

16:29.115 --> 16:30.315
It's okay.

16:30.349 --> 16:33.051
We just need to get some
background on Bobby.

16:33.085 --> 16:34.052
- Yeah.
- How'd you meet?

16:34.086 --> 16:36.988
Um, here, we met here.

16:37.023 --> 16:38.256
Were you guys friends?

16:38.291 --> 16:41.406
Um, we'd smoke after meetings sometimes.

16:42.028 --> 16:43.562
I liked him.

16:43.596 --> 16:45.931
Sarah, I need to show you something.

16:45.965 --> 16:49.968
We found this in Bobby's belongings.

16:53.206 --> 16:56.209
What... He was stalking me?

16:56.375 --> 16:58.310
We don't know.

16:58.344 --> 17:01.076
This is all that we found,
but he hid this.

17:01.147 --> 17:02.593
You didn't know that he was filming you?

17:02.617 --> 17:04.435
No.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.617
Why would he be filming me?

17:06.652 --> 17:09.771
Did he ever show any romantic interest?

17:09.797 --> 17:10.821
No.

17:10.857 --> 17:13.340
Okay, who's the guy in the video?

17:13.580 --> 17:17.192
That's my ex, Stephen Childs.

17:18.130 --> 17:19.431
They teach you to make amends.

17:19.464 --> 17:22.692
That's me doing
a poor-ass version of that.

17:23.002 --> 17:25.303
It looks pretty heated for amends.

17:25.338 --> 17:28.164
Yeah, well, drugs aren't loyal.

17:28.406 --> 17:31.375
They screw you and they screw
everyone you love.

17:31.711 --> 17:34.546
Apologizing doesn't mean
you get forgiveness.

17:34.580 --> 17:37.730
Do you mind giving us some info in case
we have to contact you?

17:38.343 --> 17:41.855
You called me Sarah Huntley.

17:43.356 --> 17:45.357
Did you see my family?

17:47.526 --> 17:49.160
It seemed like they really missed you.

17:56.235 --> 17:58.993
I'm saying we do
a different pizza every week.

17:59.105 --> 18:02.474
This week, Pizano's,
next week, Pequod's.

18:02.508 --> 18:03.752
That way, we won't get sick of it.

18:03.776 --> 18:05.677
Your arteries will get sick of it.

18:05.711 --> 18:08.246
No, I'm with you, Zo,
pizza once a week, easy.

18:08.281 --> 18:10.248
Okay, so we'll do it every Friday.

18:10.273 --> 18:11.907
I mean, for as long as we're down here.

18:16.522 --> 18:18.723
What does she mean,
"as long as we're down here"?

18:18.758 --> 18:20.625
Come on, pizza's getting cold.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.567
Nicole.

18:35.541 --> 18:37.575
Zoe and I are staying here for a while.

18:37.610 --> 18:40.845
Me and Jordan, we're getting divorced.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.348
- What?
- It's for the best.

18:43.382 --> 18:45.622
I mean, everything's fine.

18:46.071 --> 18:47.205
What happened?

18:47.286 --> 18:49.387
Just decided a couple months ago,

18:49.422 --> 18:52.032
and we don't need to
get into details now.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.852
But you always tell me
everything's fine.

18:55.876 --> 18:59.032
Yeah, well, you don't
tell me everything.

18:59.575 --> 19:01.409
But this is a big thing not to tell...

19:01.434 --> 19:04.369
Kim, I don't want to get into it now.

19:04.403 --> 19:05.804
I can't.

19:05.838 --> 19:09.574
I just wanna hang out with
my sister and my friends

19:09.608 --> 19:11.999
for the weekend and have fun.

19:13.038 --> 19:15.038
That's all, okay?

19:15.130 --> 19:16.664
Everything's fine.

19:25.124 --> 19:27.425
The guy in the video is Stephen Childs,

19:27.460 --> 19:29.260
Sarah's ex. He's 35.

19:29.295 --> 19:32.097
No priors. Works as an art curator.

19:32.131 --> 19:34.332
He's abroad, currently,
but we're tracking him down.

19:34.367 --> 19:36.167
I got Bobby's financials.

19:36.202 --> 19:38.603
So this month, Bobby made
three cash deposits

19:38.637 --> 19:40.605
into his bank account in three days.

19:40.639 --> 19:44.275
Each just shy of 10 grand.
Last month was the same thing.

19:44.310 --> 19:46.478
Most a new affiliate
ever paid Bobby for his footage

19:46.512 --> 19:48.992
- was 1,200 bucks.
- Someone's paying him off.

19:49.017 --> 19:50.038
Run with it.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.039
Track the dates of the payments
with his email

19:52.064 --> 19:54.695
and phone records, and dig into
Stephen's financials,

19:54.720 --> 19:55.875
see if it came from him.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.523
Hey, computer forensics
is done with the video.

19:58.557 --> 20:00.191
You guys wanna see some high tech work?

20:00.226 --> 20:02.646
You guys take it. I'll hang back.

20:13.973 --> 20:15.807
Your drive wasn't used much.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.953
The past three months, it only
ever had two files on it.

20:17.977 --> 20:19.044
- Two?
- Yep.

20:19.078 --> 20:21.479
There was a second file,
someone removed it manually

20:21.514 --> 20:23.832
two days ago at 9:54 p.m.

20:23.924 --> 20:26.451
Can't tell you much about it, though.
Thing's in the ether now,

20:26.485 --> 20:30.215
never had an extension,
but it wasn't very big.

20:30.423 --> 20:33.458
Now keep your eye on that SUV.

20:38.531 --> 20:40.034
There.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.667
Damn, that's her dad.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.171
Well, Sarah's lying.

20:45.438 --> 20:46.917
Everybody is.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.602
Thanks.

20:55.019 --> 20:56.553
Sarah's in the wind.

20:56.578 --> 20:59.213
Patrol went to the address she
gave us, and she cleared out.

20:59.247 --> 21:02.783
The second file on that drive
has gotta be our missing piece.

21:02.817 --> 21:05.786
Bobby removed it from the drive
an hour before he died.

21:05.820 --> 21:07.788
So if it's another
interaction with her dad,

21:07.822 --> 21:09.590
or a continuation of what's
on the video,

21:09.624 --> 21:11.168
Bobby could've been using it
to blackmail.

21:11.192 --> 21:12.960
Yeah, blackmail for what?

21:13.038 --> 21:15.950
Maybe he follows her, he
roughs her up, uses with her.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.311
We gotta bring him in to find out.

21:17.335 --> 21:20.501
No, you don't bring
a man like that in to chat.

21:20.535 --> 21:22.079
I mean, you know,
you'll get nothing, and,

21:22.103 --> 21:24.638
while you're chatting, his team
is scrubbing any evidence.

21:24.673 --> 21:27.074
So find Sarah first, okay?

21:27.108 --> 21:28.980
Tap into cameras, circulate her photo,

21:29.005 --> 21:31.011
get every copper on the street
looking for her.

21:31.046 --> 21:33.747
And get a subpoena
on Calvin's financials,

21:33.782 --> 21:36.574
but make sure it includes
a directive not to disclose,

21:36.599 --> 21:37.848
- you understand?
- Yeah.

21:37.873 --> 21:41.088
Till we know what's on that
second file, we step light.

21:41.122 --> 21:42.089
Find her.

21:42.123 --> 21:43.235
- Yo, Sarge.
- Yeah.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.080
DCFS tracked down the little girl
that Bobby recorded, Taja Bowes.

21:46.104 --> 21:47.985
She lives in a foster home
in Garfield Park.

21:48.010 --> 21:50.164
- You and me.
- Yeah, let's go.

21:50.198 --> 21:52.499
So you're police officers?

21:52.526 --> 21:53.844
Yes, we are. I'm Kevin.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.203
- This is my sergeant, Hank Voight.
- Hi.

21:56.237 --> 21:58.872
And we were hoping you could
help us out a little bit, Taja.

21:58.907 --> 22:01.976
- You know Bobby Trent, right?
- Yeah, he...

22:02.010 --> 22:06.319
He filmed my mom dying,
then he did a documentary on me.

22:06.815 --> 22:08.849
He did a documentary on you?

22:08.883 --> 22:12.219
- Yeah, I play the piano.
- Wow.

22:12.520 --> 22:15.122
Do remember the last time you saw Bobby?

22:15.156 --> 22:19.496
Tuesday. He comes to my rehearsals.

22:19.728 --> 22:21.629
Did he say anything that
seemed different,

22:21.663 --> 22:23.697
or did he seem different?

22:23.732 --> 22:27.134
- He still seemed kind of sad.
- Why is that?

22:27.175 --> 22:29.677
He told me he got his heart broken.

22:29.704 --> 22:32.282
It was a couple months ago,
but I don't think

22:32.307 --> 22:35.643
that stuff goes away right away.
That help?

22:35.677 --> 22:37.711
That does help.

22:37.746 --> 22:39.146
Thank you, Taja.

22:44.119 --> 22:45.886
I know who Bobby was.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.354
What his job was.

22:47.389 --> 22:49.966
She takes piano lessons
with the $2.00 checks

22:49.991 --> 22:51.759
that her dad makes working in prison,

22:51.793 --> 22:54.728
but when you hear her,
Bobby said it gave him

22:54.763 --> 22:56.196
a little bit of light.

22:56.231 --> 22:58.999
Sarge, we got something on Sarah.

22:59.034 --> 23:01.568
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

23:01.603 --> 23:02.904
So I pulled all the traffic cameras

23:02.928 --> 23:05.572
within a mile radius
of Sarah's apartment.

23:05.607 --> 23:08.342
Pods caught her getting picked
up three blocks from her place

23:08.376 --> 23:10.377
in a black town car, no less.

23:10.412 --> 23:12.079
Followed the cameras all the way here.

23:12.113 --> 23:14.700
She's staying in the Kaminsky suite.

23:19.754 --> 23:23.216
- Hi.
- Let me guess, you have

23:23.241 --> 23:25.382
a couple of follow up questions.

23:32.233 --> 23:36.100
Penthouse suite. Big upgrade.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.068
- My dad booked it.
- Well, yeah, we figured.

23:39.174 --> 23:40.941
Why?

23:40.975 --> 23:43.644
I told you that I'm making amends,

23:43.678 --> 23:46.280
so my dad's gonna let me come home.

23:46.314 --> 23:48.782
We were meeting to talk.

23:48.817 --> 23:52.583
Or maybe you called him for help?

23:52.787 --> 23:54.911
We know someone was paying Bobby off.

23:55.657 --> 23:57.347
Were you and Bobby
blackmailing your dad?

23:57.372 --> 23:58.792
What? No.

23:58.827 --> 24:00.942
No, of course not.

24:01.930 --> 24:05.866
Sarah, you and your dad both lied to us.

24:08.169 --> 24:10.971
That's him in the video.
That's not your ex.

24:11.005 --> 24:14.509
I'm sorry, I...
I thought that was Stephen.

24:14.534 --> 24:18.384
I... I've been to this park
with Stephen before.

24:18.409 --> 24:20.690
I forgot that I took my dad there.

24:21.316 --> 24:23.917
Look, I didn't know Bobby
was filming me.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.788
Why do you think that I'm lying to you?

24:27.822 --> 24:28.989
Because I'm an addict?

24:29.023 --> 24:31.457
No, but it makes you good at it.

24:31.482 --> 24:33.304
Look, I've apologized
to a hell of a lot of people.

24:33.328 --> 24:35.262
I-I thought that was Stephen.

24:35.296 --> 24:37.467
No, you didn't.

24:37.699 --> 24:40.434
And Bobby wasn't just
your buddy from meetings.

24:41.095 --> 24:42.262
You broke his heart.

24:42.287 --> 24:46.974
No, I-I-I didn't think that
that was worth mentioning.

24:47.008 --> 24:49.977
Just... Look, we fell into bed
a few times, it...

24:50.011 --> 24:53.050
We were both desperate
and trying to get clean.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.690
- It burned out quick.
- Sarah, you lied to us then,

24:55.715 --> 24:57.684
and you're lying to us now.

24:57.719 --> 25:00.182
Four hours after we spoke,
you packed up and you moved

25:00.207 --> 25:01.818
to a suite that your dad paid for.

25:01.843 --> 25:05.225
You think we're just gonna believe
that that's a coincidence?

25:05.260 --> 25:07.357
Were you and Bobby
blackmailing your dad?

25:07.382 --> 25:09.897
No, no! Look, I'm sorry,

25:09.931 --> 25:12.690
I don't know what to tell you, but I...

25:12.934 --> 25:15.313
After you showed up, yes,
I called my dad

25:15.338 --> 25:17.276
because I was scared.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.405
We can hold you for 48 hours.

25:22.277 --> 25:24.054
Get comfortable.

25:29.918 --> 25:32.152
Well, there's nothing
in Sarah's financials

25:32.187 --> 25:34.087
that suggests that she got paid out.

25:34.122 --> 25:36.007
Bobby's phone records match her story.

25:36.032 --> 25:37.501
They stopped talking three months ago.

25:37.525 --> 25:39.893
One month later,
blackmail payments get started.

25:39.928 --> 25:42.216
Well, she and the Huntleys
confirmed that she was cut off

25:42.241 --> 25:44.064
a year ago,
which financially checks out,

25:44.116 --> 25:46.934
but they sent Sarah to live with
her mother's distant cousin,

25:47.084 --> 25:49.186
so she hasn't lived with
the family since she was a kid.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.482
Well, they're a family of means;
Maybe that's how they parent.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.841
Yeah, but it's not how
they parented her brother.

25:53.875 --> 25:56.076
He went to school
three blocks from the house,

25:56.101 --> 25:59.370
and her therapy/rehab didn't
start till she was 19.

25:59.414 --> 26:00.848
They iced her out way before that.

26:00.882 --> 26:02.916
Okay. That's the ME's office.

26:02.951 --> 26:04.952
They need us down there right now.

26:04.986 --> 26:06.476
Yeah.

26:07.422 --> 26:09.089
Found it when we cut him open.

26:09.123 --> 26:11.758
Luckily hadn't gotten too far
into his stomach.

26:11.793 --> 26:14.127
When you die, your stomach's
still digesting.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.419
Gut bacteria actually starts to eat you,

26:16.444 --> 26:18.756
but it hadn't gotten that far.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.875
I'm sorry, you found what?

26:21.247 --> 26:23.481
Your boy swallowed it
right before he was shot.

26:27.696 --> 26:31.686
All right, now whoever killed
him was looking for this.

26:32.180 --> 26:34.081
This is our second file.

26:38.987 --> 26:41.366
Well, it's not a video file. It's audio.

26:41.990 --> 26:44.622
It's 46 seconds.
That's the exact same length.

26:44.826 --> 26:47.075
<i>What he hell do you want from me?</i>

26:47.295 --> 26:49.935
<i>What do I want? For you to apologize.</i>

26:50.131 --> 26:51.909
<i>For you to even admit
that you did something...</i>

26:51.933 --> 26:53.500
<i>- That was long time ago.
- Not to me.</i>

26:53.534 --> 26:55.284
<i>- Sarah...
- Not to me, it wasn't!</i>

26:55.309 --> 26:56.288
<i>What you did...</i>

26:56.313 --> 26:59.282
<i>- I was sick!
- No, you don't get to say that.</i>

26:59.307 --> 27:01.062
<i>- Calm down, you're in a public place.
- I don't care.</i>

27:01.086 --> 27:04.210
<i>I don't have to calm down.
You won't even admit...</i>

27:04.235 --> 27:05.570
<i>I admitted to you that I was sick!</i>

27:05.594 --> 27:08.188
<i>- That's not sick!
- Stop it.</i>

27:08.586 --> 27:11.032
<i>You raped me.</i>

27:11.286 --> 27:13.040
<i>I was nine.</i>

27:13.187 --> 27:16.089
<i>You're my dad.
You're supposed to protect me.</i>

27:16.124 --> 27:20.176
<i>Calm down, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, I apologize.</i>

27:20.201 --> 27:21.768
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

27:35.648 --> 27:38.637
<i>- I was sick!
- No, you don't get to say that.</i>

27:38.662 --> 27:40.102
<i>Calm down, you're in a public place.</i>

27:40.132 --> 27:42.551
<i>I don't care. I don't have to calm down.</i>

27:42.576 --> 27:43.778
<i>You won't even admit...</i>

27:43.803 --> 27:45.059
<i>I admitted to you that I was sick!</i>

27:45.083 --> 27:46.660
<i>- That's not sick!
- Turn it off.</i>

27:46.685 --> 27:49.887
<i>- Stop it.
- You raped me.</i>

27:52.957 --> 27:54.861
Sarah...

27:54.939 --> 27:56.774
I understand why
you didn't wanna tell us

27:56.808 --> 28:00.501
what was on this video,
and I'm so sorry...

28:02.881 --> 28:05.916
But you've gotta understand
that, from where I'm sitting,

28:05.950 --> 28:10.030
this is enough for Bobby
to blackmail your father.

28:10.388 --> 28:13.424
If that's what he was doing,
I didn't know.

28:13.523 --> 28:17.374
If you didn't know he was
filming you, okay, fine.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.512
But the minute
that I showed you this video,

28:20.537 --> 28:23.317
you knew what it was,
and you had to know

28:23.342 --> 28:26.131
that Bobby was using it
to blackmail your dad.

28:26.304 --> 28:28.972
That's why you called
your dad as soon as we left.

28:29.007 --> 28:31.113
Bobby shouldn't have filmed it.

28:31.492 --> 28:34.378
If I'd known he was gonna
film it, I would've...

28:35.355 --> 28:36.871
You would've what?

28:41.019 --> 28:43.901
Sarah, this video...

28:44.284 --> 28:47.034
This ruins your family business.

28:47.221 --> 28:50.435
This is worth millions of dollars.

28:50.460 --> 28:51.701
This is motive.

28:51.726 --> 28:54.757
I don't know anything.

29:03.570 --> 29:06.176
I mean, I can take another run at her,

29:06.437 --> 29:08.373
but I don't know that
we're gonna crack through

29:08.398 --> 29:12.959
whatever loyalty or fear
he built in her without more.

29:12.984 --> 29:15.058
Then we move without her.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.121
Bobby's sleeping with Sarah,
he finds out who she really is

29:18.156 --> 29:19.423
and what happened.

29:19.457 --> 29:22.559
He convinces her to confront her father,

29:22.593 --> 29:24.138
films the whole thing
without her knowledge,

29:24.162 --> 29:25.591
and then he goes to shake Calvin down.

29:25.615 --> 29:28.031
He reaches too high,
and Calvin takes care of him.

29:28.066 --> 29:30.449
We don't have evidence
for that in Calvin's financials,

29:30.481 --> 29:32.434
not yet. I mean, we're trying,

29:32.459 --> 29:34.371
but the company's got over 300 accounts.

29:34.405 --> 29:35.939
We got the guy on tape admitting

29:35.973 --> 29:38.241
- that he raped his daughter.
- All right, bring him in,

29:38.276 --> 29:39.898
but you all understand what this'll be.

29:39.923 --> 29:42.251
We can't have 99.9.

29:42.647 --> 29:44.933
I mean, we need 100%.

29:45.149 --> 29:46.910
Yeah.

29:50.621 --> 29:51.722
Jay.

29:54.992 --> 29:57.075
Trouble at home?

29:57.628 --> 30:00.173
No, we're just working some stuff out.

30:00.364 --> 30:03.043
I heard all that before.
I'm done with that now.

30:03.201 --> 30:07.237
I want both you, so clear it up,
get back to doing your job,

30:07.271 --> 30:09.038
or you're gone. You understand?

30:09.374 --> 30:11.041
Yeah.

30:13.778 --> 30:16.226
My client will not answer
any questions regarding any

30:16.251 --> 30:20.251
allegations or any appearance
of a confession on a video tape.

30:20.342 --> 30:23.398
As a show of faith, however,
he is willing to speak

30:23.423 --> 30:26.957
on his relationship
with Bobby Trent, but, be aware,

30:26.991 --> 30:29.136
I will shut you down the moment
you make any attempts...

30:29.160 --> 30:30.988
Yeah, are we about done here?

30:32.163 --> 30:34.253
Yeah, go ahead.

30:34.706 --> 30:37.199
So we're operating on faith here, Cal?

30:37.468 --> 30:39.169
Go ahead.

30:39.308 --> 30:41.480
Tell me what you want me to know.

30:42.073 --> 30:44.478
Bobby sent me the tape
two months ago with a note

30:44.503 --> 30:47.805
saying the audio would be
released if I didn't pay.

30:48.346 --> 30:52.115
I paid. He wanted more. I paid again.

30:52.305 --> 30:54.551
See, I know where you grew up.

30:54.703 --> 30:57.020
I came out of Cicero.

30:57.141 --> 30:59.315
Know what we used to call you guys?

30:59.724 --> 31:02.151
Junkyard dogs.

31:02.395 --> 31:04.596
Yeah, we'd ask "How are you?"

31:04.829 --> 31:07.307
You'd say, "Why the hell
you wanna know?"

31:09.033 --> 31:12.307
See, I'm guessing for a guy like you,

31:12.332 --> 31:16.151
even after all these years
being under someone's thumb,

31:16.541 --> 31:18.792
it just felt wrong.

31:20.077 --> 31:21.578
I would've kept paying.

31:21.612 --> 31:23.513
Yeah, if the footage was released...

31:25.349 --> 31:29.935
Now your family business
earns, what, 600 mil a year?

31:31.189 --> 31:33.099
And its CEO is being accused of raping

31:33.124 --> 31:34.501
- his nine-year-old daughter.
- All right, that's it.

31:34.525 --> 31:36.545
My client is not gonna sit here
and listen to any more of this.

31:36.569 --> 31:37.764
That's enough. Do you hear me?

31:37.788 --> 31:39.874
- Enough.
- No.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.232
I never heard from Bobby
after the second payment.

31:42.266 --> 31:45.486
I'm happy to share all
our correspondence with you.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.986
Thursday night, I was with my wife,

31:48.105 --> 31:52.164
and my friend Miles, a junkyard dog,

31:52.310 --> 31:53.710
will confirm that.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.485
All right.

31:55.613 --> 31:58.110
You keep smiling, Cal.

31:58.249 --> 32:01.211
You know, the nice thing about my job,

32:01.586 --> 32:04.175
no matter how much money you have,

32:04.822 --> 32:08.027
I land every killer
in the exact same place.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.011
You say so.

32:12.730 --> 32:14.564
His lawyer's playing it right.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.533
Even if Sarah gave you
a statement for the rape,

32:16.567 --> 32:18.735
which would've been
necessary for a charge,

32:18.769 --> 32:20.823
the abuse occurred
22 years ago in a state

32:20.848 --> 32:22.772
with a statute of limitations that's 20.

32:23.262 --> 32:24.463
You have to get him on the murder.

32:24.487 --> 32:27.329
Calvin's financials show
that his assistant withdrew

32:27.354 --> 32:29.412
the 60 grand
from Calvin's son's college fund

32:29.447 --> 32:30.806
and FedExed it to Bobby.

32:30.831 --> 32:32.749
- Burgess.
- The alibi's airtight.

32:32.783 --> 32:35.688
Both Jessica and his friend
Miles confirmed

32:35.713 --> 32:37.262
that Calvin was home all night.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.614
Could the killer have been hired?

32:38.639 --> 32:39.956
No, it was too sloppy.

32:39.981 --> 32:42.642
The killer was in the car,
gave Bobby time to struggle.

32:42.677 --> 32:45.278
Sergeant, Calvin's lawyer
Williams is downstairs

32:45.312 --> 32:46.813
insisting Sarah see a lawyer.

32:46.847 --> 32:49.406
Well, he can insist all he want.
He can't be her lawyer.

32:49.450 --> 32:50.652
It's a conflict of interest.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.272
Yeah, he's got another
attorney with him.

32:52.296 --> 32:54.545
Insists Sarah's her client.

32:54.955 --> 32:56.433
You have to let
her lawyer upstairs then.

32:56.457 --> 32:58.058
We need to talk to her first.

32:58.092 --> 32:59.325
Stall them.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.594
You can't do that, Hank.

33:01.629 --> 33:02.962
Stall them.

33:07.468 --> 33:09.436
Your lawyer's downstairs.

33:09.470 --> 33:10.937
Or your dad's lawyer, I should say.

33:10.971 --> 33:13.451
Your dad is in the next room.

33:13.607 --> 33:15.918
By law, I have to
let your lawyer up here

33:15.943 --> 33:22.426
unless you tell me not to,
or you can sign this waiver

33:22.850 --> 33:24.833
and just talk to me.

33:25.820 --> 33:27.520
I don't understand.

33:27.822 --> 33:32.073
Sarah, you could've asked me
for a lawyer at any time,

33:32.098 --> 33:34.941
- but you didn't.
- I told you all I know.

33:38.999 --> 33:40.967
It's family.

33:47.508 --> 33:50.220
My mom never even told me who my dad is.

33:50.878 --> 33:53.206
It was always just me and her,

33:53.547 --> 33:56.097
and she was a terrible parent.

33:57.017 --> 34:01.464
She failed me every time, and I took it

34:01.856 --> 34:03.534
because I didn't have a choice.

34:03.657 --> 34:07.048
She was all I knew, all I had.

34:07.353 --> 34:11.110
So I stand there in front of her,
and I take it on the chin.

34:13.734 --> 34:18.195
And every single hit has hurt.

34:19.172 --> 34:22.007
So I look at you, and I look at
what you're going through,

34:22.109 --> 34:24.878
and I think to myself,
"There's gotta be a time

34:24.911 --> 34:27.592
where we stop standing up for more."

34:28.429 --> 34:30.661
He's gonna let me come home

34:32.585 --> 34:37.193
to my brother... and my mom.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.326
It's my family.

34:44.697 --> 34:46.474
I'll lose all of them.

34:47.935 --> 34:50.232
Did you ever really have them?

34:54.742 --> 34:56.359
Sarah...

34:57.161 --> 34:59.366
Did your dad kill Bobby?

35:08.696 --> 35:09.997
Can you provide an explanation...

35:10.021 --> 35:11.806
- You'll see.
- To why we're...

35:22.534 --> 35:23.628
Where's her lawyer?

35:23.662 --> 35:25.689
She waived her right.

35:26.331 --> 35:28.757
Now, this is a copy of her statement.

35:29.501 --> 35:32.904
It details the rape
when she was nine years old.

35:32.938 --> 35:34.264
Can I take a look at that statement?

35:34.288 --> 35:36.040
You'll get it in discovery
in three months.

35:36.074 --> 35:39.262
It also covers
your confrontation months ago,

35:39.578 --> 35:43.027
and your promise in your hotel
suite to let her come home.

35:43.849 --> 35:46.137
I know the law.
You can lie to me all you want.

35:49.655 --> 35:53.204
<i>I knew as soon as I saw
the tape, but I just...</i>

35:53.992 --> 35:56.627
<i>I called my dad right after
you showed it to me.</i>

35:56.751 --> 35:59.696
<i>He sent me the car,
and it took me to the hotel,</i>

35:59.832 --> 36:01.635
<i>and he met me there.</i>

36:02.252 --> 36:04.503
- This is ridiculous.
- Stop talking.

36:04.611 --> 36:06.043
<i>I confronted him.</i>

36:06.177 --> 36:09.426
<i>I... I accused him,</i>

36:10.609 --> 36:13.854
<i>and he said that he killed
Bobby for our family.</i>

36:16.448 --> 36:17.415
She's lying.

36:17.449 --> 36:19.484
Cal, stop talking.

36:19.518 --> 36:22.587
Yeah, Bobby made quite
an impression on your daughter.

36:22.821 --> 36:26.134
Yeah, he was paranoid,
convinced her to be too.

36:26.525 --> 36:28.526
Taught her to record everything.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.161
<i>I know what you did!</i>

36:30.195 --> 36:32.930
<i>He was my friend, and you
took him too, you just...</i>

36:32.965 --> 36:38.329
<i>I made a decision, Sarah. A decision
to get rid of that parasite for us.</i>

36:38.524 --> 36:39.859
<i>So why don't you make one right now.</i>

36:39.883 --> 36:42.099
<i>What do you want? You wanna threaten me?</i>

36:42.124 --> 36:44.812
<i>You wanna... you wanna
destroy this family?</i>

36:44.964 --> 36:46.601
<i>Or do you wanna come home?</i>

36:46.991 --> 36:49.608
<i>'Cause we can make that deal right now.</i>

36:50.482 --> 36:52.313
<i>I love you, sweetheart.</i>

36:52.684 --> 36:54.673
<i>Come home.</i>

36:55.153 --> 36:56.554
Couldn't that have been altered?

36:56.602 --> 37:00.940
No, we got the original this time.

37:01.827 --> 37:03.731
And Sarah's gonna testify to all of it.

37:03.756 --> 37:05.443
We're done.

37:06.150 --> 37:07.484
You're done.

37:07.933 --> 37:09.740
Turn around.

37:10.418 --> 37:11.518
What do we do here?

37:11.551 --> 37:13.629
Hey, that's fine, that's fine.

37:13.672 --> 37:16.026
You don't wanna turn around,
that's okay.

37:16.608 --> 37:19.768
'Cause I'd like nothing more than
to shove your face in the floor.

37:21.780 --> 37:23.252
Turn around, Cal.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.635
Cal, turn around.

37:26.552 --> 37:28.519
You do not say a word
to anybody, not anybody,

37:28.573 --> 37:30.588
do you hear me?
I'll see you in bond court.

37:30.622 --> 37:31.781
That's the next time you will talk.

37:31.805 --> 37:35.871
- Do you understand me? Understand?
- Let's go. Let's go.

37:47.490 --> 37:51.616
Um, hey, look...

37:52.445 --> 37:55.123
I don't want to tiptoe
around you at work.

37:56.410 --> 38:01.380
That's not us, and I...

38:01.779 --> 38:03.646
I think I just...

38:04.890 --> 38:07.364
I need some time right now.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.403
Yeah, I do too.

38:12.998 --> 38:15.316
Thank God for the job though, right?

38:16.420 --> 38:18.069
I mean, every day
you get to meet somebody

38:18.103 --> 38:20.185
whose problems are bigger than yours.

38:21.171 --> 38:23.139
Yeah, I guess so.

38:28.180 --> 38:32.650
I got Sarah into a 90-day
rehab facility,

38:32.684 --> 38:36.404
so I'm gonna go get her checked in.

38:46.198 --> 38:49.071
<i>My dad's never heard me play,
but he writes me</i>

38:49.207 --> 38:50.741
<i>a couple times a week.</i>

38:50.869 --> 38:52.637
<i>He says he doesn't have to hear it.</i>

38:52.671 --> 38:54.487
<i>He knows I must be good.</i>

39:03.115 --> 39:04.875
What are you wearing? We need to go.

39:04.900 --> 39:07.814
Yeah, I know. Don't hate me, okay?

39:07.947 --> 39:11.242
I was thinking today
was so long that maybe

39:11.267 --> 39:14.124
I'd just... I'd stay in
and hang with Zoe.

39:14.359 --> 39:15.826
I should stay in too, shouldn't I?

39:15.861 --> 39:18.499
No, you should go to the birthday.

39:19.998 --> 39:22.815
If you need a day,
a night, or a weekend,

39:22.840 --> 39:24.201
you should have it.

39:24.410 --> 39:27.019
All this is gonna
be here in the morning.

39:28.140 --> 39:30.074
I love you.

39:30.342 --> 39:32.076
I love you too.

39:35.714 --> 39:36.714
- Have fun.
- Bye.

39:36.748 --> 39:39.158
- That's an order.
- Thank you.

39:40.409 --> 39:42.668
I thought I was
staying home alone tonight.

39:42.988 --> 39:45.199
Not a chance, sorry.

39:45.857 --> 39:47.487
I'm gonna change into my pajamas,

39:47.512 --> 39:50.795
and then we're gonna order
an obscene amount of pizza,

39:50.829 --> 39:53.631
and then we're gonna talk about
how much it sucks

39:53.665 --> 39:55.991
that your parents are getting divorced.

39:56.334 --> 40:00.671
And that whatever we stupid adults do,

40:00.706 --> 40:03.894
or however bad it seems right now,

40:05.944 --> 40:08.628
you're gonna be just fine.

40:09.781 --> 40:12.081
Okay? Good.

40:12.851 --> 40:14.785
Let's get pizza.

40:28.266 --> 40:31.102
- You Hank Voight?
- Yeah, I am.

40:31.136 --> 40:33.270
You realize it's your ass
if this goes south?

40:33.305 --> 40:34.908
I get it.

40:35.974 --> 40:38.764
Hey, man, come on out.

40:39.711 --> 40:40.978
There you go.

40:43.815 --> 40:46.217
You the guy that swung me the day pass?

40:46.356 --> 40:48.119
That's right.

40:48.239 --> 40:50.223
Why?

40:50.455 --> 40:52.504
Little bit of light.

40:53.650 --> 40:56.185
Come on. Thank you.
