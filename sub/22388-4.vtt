ANNOUNCER: <i>From the Penn &amp; Teller Theater</i>
<i>in Las Vegas, Nevada,</i>

00:26.333 --> 00:29.433
<i>here's our host, Jonathan Ross!</i>

00:30.033 --> 00:31.300
Thank you very much.

00:31.367 --> 00:33.467
Thank you. You're very kind.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.633
Thank you.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.200
Welcome to <i>Penn &amp; Teller: Fool us.</i>

00:41.267 --> 00:44.033
Tonight, the game is simple.
Our famous duo will try and figure out

00:44.100 --> 00:46.467
what tricks, cards, or really long scarves

00:46.533 --> 00:47.933
-our acts have up their sleeves.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:48.000 --> 00:51.167
Now, any magician who manages to fool them
gets to return here to Vegas

00:51.233 --> 00:54.500
to perform with Penn and Teller as
part of their world-famous nightly show.

00:54.567 --> 00:56.867
So, let's meet our main men
who, rumor has it,

00:56.933 --> 00:59.933
were the real-life inspiration
for Grumpy and Bashful,

01:00.067 --> 01:01.233
which I guess makes me Dopey...

01:01.300 --> 01:03.600
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-...here they are. It's Penn and Teller!

01:03.667 --> 01:05.367
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

01:10.000 --> 01:11.900
Teller, fabulous to see you.

01:11.967 --> 01:14.833
Penn, as always, great to have you.
Penn and Teller, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17.667 --> 01:20.400
Gentlemen, if you'd like to take
your chairs, the show can get started.

01:20.467 --> 01:22.333
Penn and Teller, ladies and gentlemen!

01:32.267 --> 01:34.533
So sit back and get ready to be amazed

01:34.600 --> 01:36.767
because it's time to meet
our first magician.

01:40.633 --> 01:43.900
<i>My name is Austin Janik</i>
<i>and I'm from Simi Valley, California.</i>

01:45.000 --> 01:48.333
My personal style is youthful energy
because I am only 16 years old.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.933
<i>I first got into magic through my dad</i>
<i>who, early in my life,</i>

01:52.000 --> 01:53.900
<i>would always just show me</i>
<i>small magic tricks.</i>

01:53.967 --> 01:57.667
Aside from magic, I also am involved
in a lot of other activities.

01:57.733 --> 02:02.033
<i>Speech and debate, robotics,</i>
<i>as well as competitive diving.</i>

02:03.633 --> 02:06.767
Even from the youngest age,
I would go around to restaurants

02:06.833 --> 02:09.300
<i>performing magic</i>
<i>for the patrons who were there.</i>

02:09.366 --> 02:12.800
At first when they see this young kid,
they don't expect it to be any good.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.100
<i>But what was really impressive</i>

02:14.167 --> 02:15.700
<i>-was the moment when they realized...</i>
-(EXCLAIMS)

02:15.767 --> 02:18.233
<i>...that they were being fooled,</i>
<i>they were being amazed.</i>

02:18.300 --> 02:20.167
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I'm gonna fool Penn and Teller,</i>

02:20.233 --> 02:21.767
but I definitely hope to impress them.

02:22.033 --> 02:23.900
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

02:23.967 --> 02:26.400
Will you please welcome Austin Janik?

02:31.700 --> 02:33.600
Because magic relies on misdirection,

02:33.667 --> 02:37.500
a lot of people think of it
as sort of a dishonest endeavor.

02:37.567 --> 02:40.767
However, it was actually
American magician Karl Germain

02:40.833 --> 02:44.333
who said that magic
is the only honest profession.

02:44.633 --> 02:47.067
A magician promises to deceive you,

02:47.133 --> 02:48.633
-and he does.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLE)

02:48.700 --> 02:50.367
So to illustrate this, I'm gonna have

02:50.433 --> 02:53.900
-Jonathan come up and join me here.
-JONATHAN: Sure. Nice to meet you, Austin.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.467
Nice, thank you so much, Jonathan.

02:55.533 --> 02:58.033
What I'm gonna have you do is,
as I go through the cards,

02:58.100 --> 02:59.900
just say "stop" at some point.

02:59.967 --> 03:01.100
-Stop.
-Right there?

03:01.167 --> 03:02.833
-Yeah.
-All right, we're gonna take the next card

03:02.900 --> 03:06.067
from where you stopped,
and we can all take a look at what it is.

03:06.133 --> 03:08.700
You have the Queen of Spades.

03:08.767 --> 03:10.333
So I'm gonna let you
hold on to the Queen of Spades.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.700
-Okay.
-And I want you to take it,

03:11.767 --> 03:13.333
hold it horizontally,

03:13.467 --> 03:16.100
-and then tear it neatly in half.
-Okay.

03:16.167 --> 03:18.367
All the way down, neatly in half.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.400
Perfect.

03:20.467 --> 03:21.967
All right, now what I want you to do
is take one piece

03:22.033 --> 03:23.867
-and just place one on top of the other...
-Okay.

03:23.933 --> 03:26.833
...and then you're gonna tear it
in half again along the side there.

03:28.867 --> 03:30.500
One tear, and you know what?
We're gonna do it again.

03:30.567 --> 03:31.967
-Yeah, you know, you really...
-So, one more time...

03:32.033 --> 03:34.333
...called the wrong guy up here.
Feel that, there's nothing.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.667
-I know.
-There's nothing. Okay.

03:35.733 --> 03:37.033
One more time, put all the pieces again,

03:37.100 --> 03:40.833
tear it one more time
to get eight equal pieces with the cards.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.400
(JONATHAN GROANS)

03:42.933 --> 03:44.367
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Almost.

03:46.167 --> 03:47.867
All right, there you go.
Round of applause

03:47.933 --> 03:49.100
-for the perfect show...
-Thank you.

03:49.167 --> 03:50.500
...and feat of strength.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.800
Go ahead, take the pieces,
place them face-up there on the table.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.400
And I also have a few paper clips here.

03:56.467 --> 03:58.300
Go ahead and just select
one of those paper clips.

03:58.367 --> 03:59.400
Okay.

03:59.467 --> 04:02.833
All right, now, I'm gonna
paper clip all of these pieces together,

04:02.900 --> 04:05.767
but I'm gonna let you
hold on to one of your pieces first.

04:05.833 --> 04:07.567
-Okay.
-The rest get sealed...

04:07.633 --> 04:09.967
-(CLICKS)
-...with the paper clip.

04:10.033 --> 04:12.300
Now, go ahead, take your piece.
Show it up to the camera

04:12.367 --> 04:15.800
so that the audience can see
the distinct tear you've created.

04:16.067 --> 04:18.867
That tear is only matched

04:18.933 --> 04:22.467
by the rest of the pieces
locked in the paper clip.

04:22.533 --> 04:24.900
But from the right light and angle,

04:25.500 --> 04:27.833
-we can get something else.
-(AUDIENCE GASP)

04:27.900 --> 04:32.300
Sealed in a paper clip,
and this is my student I.D.

04:32.367 --> 04:34.100
Now, the strange thing is,

04:34.167 --> 04:38.267
all of the pieces are gone and
I normally keep this I.D. in my wallet,

04:38.333 --> 04:41.367
so if what was in my wallet
is now here in my hands,

04:41.433 --> 04:46.567
maybe we'll find all of your pieces
inside of my wallet.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.767
Inside...

04:49.233 --> 04:54.900
I don't have a bunch of pieces,
but what I do have is one single card.

04:55.267 --> 04:58.333
Now, you selected the Queen of Spades.

04:58.667 --> 05:01.733
I'm holding the Queen of Spades,

05:02.067 --> 05:06.967
but it's missing one piece.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.867
-So I want you to verify...
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

05:09.933 --> 05:14.433
...for proof-positive identification,
do the two cards match perfectly?

05:14.500 --> 05:15.700
JONATHAN: They really do. Look at that.

05:15.767 --> 05:19.333
-It's a perfect match. How about that?
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

05:22.867 --> 05:25.267
I'll take the piece from you, Jonathan.
The Queen of Spades.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.500
Now, very single ridge on this card

05:27.567 --> 05:30.500
makes it a perfect match
with the other piece.

05:30.567 --> 05:33.633
Now, in the same way,
it's the small details of our signature

05:33.700 --> 05:36.567
that make it so unique.
So, I have a marker here.

05:36.633 --> 05:39.967
What I want you to do is
go ahead and sign your name

05:40.033 --> 05:41.600
across your Queen of Spades.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.700
That'll add a secondary mark
of identification.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.300
-JONATHAN: There.
-Excellent.

05:46.367 --> 05:47.767
Now, I'm gonna take the marker

05:47.833 --> 05:50.500
and I'm gonna also
just put my initials here

05:50.567 --> 05:53.633
on the Queen of Spades.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.000
Just like that.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.067
Now, theoretically, as a magician,

05:57.133 --> 06:00.067
I can restore
this final piece onto the card,

06:00.133 --> 06:03.933
but that would remove
the tear that's proof of the magic.

06:04.167 --> 06:09.300
Instead, it would be far better
to turn this piece over and restore it...

06:10.267 --> 06:11.833
(BLOWS) ...backwards...

06:14.600 --> 06:16.800
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-...so that we get

06:16.867 --> 06:18.967
your initials on the front,

06:19.033 --> 06:21.267
my signature on the back.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.600
You can hang on to that.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.100
Thank you so much
for helping me, Jonathan.

06:24.167 --> 06:26.600
Wow. Wow. Wow.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.233
-Thank you, everybody.
-Austin Janik, ladies and gentlemen.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.533
Come around the front here, young man,
and we'll talk.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.400
Now, how long
have you been studying magic for?

06:34.467 --> 06:35.633
When did you start doing magic?

06:35.700 --> 06:37.400
Well, my dad would show me magic tricks

06:37.467 --> 06:39.867
back as long as I can remember
when I was probably five.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.633
But I picked up
my first book on sleight-of-hand

06:41.700 --> 06:43.033
when I was nine years old,

06:43.200 --> 06:46.200
and since then I've performed
everywhere I had the opportunity,

06:46.267 --> 06:48.433
-restaurants or gas stations, wherever.
-Yeah.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.733
You, you've been home-schooled
by your parents, I believe.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.533
-Is that right?
-Yes, home-schooled all the way through.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.167
But when you're home-schooled
if you want to not go to school,

06:55.233 --> 06:57.567
where do you go
when you don't, that's what I...

06:57.633 --> 06:58.633
That's the drawback.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.133
-I'm stuck, you know.
-That was the most...

07:00.200 --> 07:01.400
If I'm grounded, I'm still in school...

07:01.467 --> 07:03.367
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-...so I, detention forever, I guess.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.300
Let's find out what they thought.

07:05.367 --> 07:07.600
Ladies and gentlemen, over to Penn.

07:08.633 --> 07:12.800
I am absolutely amazed that at, um,

07:14.100 --> 07:17.367
16 years old, on stage in Vegas,

07:17.833 --> 07:21.067
uh, this many people,
this many cameras around,

07:21.400 --> 07:25.733
no "uhs" or stammers or "ums"
or "buts" or "you knows."

07:26.033 --> 07:29.933
Just clean patter all the way through,
spoken beautifully.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.867
I was as impressed with that
as even the magic,

07:32.933 --> 07:35.833
just a kind of style
and a way of carrying yourself

07:35.900 --> 07:37.233
that was just beautiful.
I just thought...

07:37.300 --> 07:38.633
-AUSTIN: Thank you.
-...it was a great performance.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.167
Thank you so much.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.133
And then, your sleight of hand
was the same way. Abs...

07:47.200 --> 07:50.367
Everything was just clean
and well-rehearsed.

07:50.433 --> 07:52.933
The, um, the twisting the Aces,
which I think, Derek Dingle trick

07:53.000 --> 07:54.700
which you had
a little kicker in the end...

07:54.767 --> 07:55.800
Yeah.

07:55.867 --> 07:57.767
That you changed on there
was done beautifully.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.900
That, the mis-made card,
the corner turned around,

08:02.233 --> 08:06.033
we believe that's an actual
commercial thing,

08:06.233 --> 08:07.300
but you don't...

08:07.367 --> 08:10.400
In buying magic,
you don't really buy magic.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.433
You can buy that commercial product,

08:12.500 --> 08:16.467
and then it is hours and hours
and hours of work

08:16.533 --> 08:17.900
to learn how to handle that.

08:17.967 --> 08:22.700
So, although you did not fool us,

08:22.767 --> 08:25.567
you absolutely amazed us and blew us away.

08:25.633 --> 08:27.167
-You just destroyed it.
-Thank you so much.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.367
Just absolutely wonderful. And we have...

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
Since you have something
you could buy in a shop,

08:32.467 --> 08:34.500
here's something else
you could buy in a shop.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.866
-This is the Penn and Teller magic kit...
-Thank you so much, sir.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.299
And I think
you know everything in there,

08:39.366 --> 08:40.832
but it's a chance to have our picture.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.732
You can cut it out,
put it on your wall there.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.033
(ALL LAUGHING)

08:44.100 --> 08:45.933
-Thank you so much, Penn and Teller.
-Thank you so much.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.100
JONATHAN: Austin Janik,
ladies and gentlemen.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.467
-Thank you so much.
-Great work, young man.

08:48.533 --> 08:49.733
-Fabulous stuff. Take care.
-Thank you.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.100
Austin Janik.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.533
It's time to meet our next fooler.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.233
Hi. I'm the Amazing Allison.

09:01.567 --> 09:04.400
<i>I live right here in Viva Las Vegas.</i>
<i>I'm a mentalist.</i>

09:04.467 --> 09:06.467
I love my Krav Maga.

09:06.533 --> 09:08.133
I shoot guns.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.633
I ride motorcycles.
I'm a really bad-ass girl.

09:14.067 --> 09:17.400
My father taught Navy Seals
and taught me how to read people.

09:17.467 --> 09:18.833
Go ahead, take a look at it.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.767
And that's really where
it all began with me

09:20.833 --> 09:22.067
with this obsession of mentalism.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.667
Tell me exactly
what card was it that you chose?

09:24.733 --> 09:26.133
Nine of Hearts.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.967
The Nine of Hearts.

09:28.033 --> 09:33.367
<i>Being a girl in a mentalist world</i>
<i>is definitely a lonely place to be.</i>

09:33.433 --> 09:35.067
Starting out, I was kind of shunned.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.667
<i>But after a while,</i>
<i>once they started to realize</i>

09:38.733 --> 09:41.633
that I'm here to stay,
they started to actually see me as a peer.

09:41.933 --> 09:44.367
<i>If you aren't gonna stand by me,</i>
<i>then move.</i>

09:45.633 --> 09:47.433

09:47.500 --> 09:49.967
Will you please welcome Amazing Allison?

09:52.900 --> 09:55.300
ALLISON: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much.

09:55.533 --> 09:58.033
My name is the Amazing Allison,
but I actually do need

09:58.100 --> 10:00.900
two more amazing performers
to please join me onstage.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.933
Penn, will you please? Teller, please?
Give them a round of applause.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.167
-You want me here?
-Yes, please.

10:07.233 --> 10:09.300
-Okay.
-And Mr. Teller right there.

10:09.767 --> 10:11.367
-Perfect, thank you.
-Thank you.

10:11.433 --> 10:14.900
Well, guys, as you know, I am a mentalist,
so I am planning on doing a little bit of

10:14.967 --> 10:17.067
-what most people know as mind reading.
-Okay.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.867
So, Penn, I'm gonna start with you.

10:18.933 --> 10:20.933
You tend to be
a little bit more analytical, you,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.400
you're a numbers guy, so I'm gonna try
something with numbers with you.

10:23.467 --> 10:24.867
Okay.

10:24.933 --> 10:27.100
I'm gonna make
a little thought-bubble for you, okay?

10:27.167 --> 10:29.533
This is going to simulate
what you are thinking.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.600
Okay.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.133
I'm gonna have you
think of a two-digit number,

10:32.200 --> 10:34.167
let's say between 25 and 100.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.467
-Okay.
-Don't say it out loud.

10:35.533 --> 10:36.567
You're gonna write it down

10:36.633 --> 10:37.633
-in your thought-bubble...
-Mmm-hmm.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.067
...then you're gonna fold it
right up into quarters.

10:39.133 --> 10:41.200
Make sure that
nobody else sees it but you.

10:41.267 --> 10:42.433
-Okay, okay.
-Okay?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.333
Don't do it yet.
I'm gonna turn away, okay?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.900
And I do not show it to the camera...

10:45.967 --> 10:48.367
Do not. Do not show it to anyone.

10:48.433 --> 10:50.067
Teller, my friend.

10:50.533 --> 10:52.500
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You are definitely...

10:54.033 --> 10:57.967
(CHUCKLES) You're definitely
the more, um, artistic, creative,

10:58.033 --> 10:59.300
imaginative one,

10:59.367 --> 11:01.400
-so what I'd like to do with you...
-(SCOFFS)

11:01.467 --> 11:02.533
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

11:03.133 --> 11:04.733
You're going to draw a picture.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.567
Now, this can be something simple.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.100
Don't make it too complex.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.100
You could draw anything you want, okay?

11:10.167 --> 11:12.000
Anything... You want.

11:12.067 --> 11:13.533
Now, I'm not
influencing you at all, right?

11:14.267 --> 11:15.933
Once you've done your drawing,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.233
just flip it downward
so that I can't see it.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.700
I'm gonna turn away now

11:19.767 --> 11:21.533
-so you guys can both do your thing.
-Okay.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.033
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLE)
-We're ready.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.967
Oh, thank you for letting me know.

11:33.733 --> 11:36.633
Okay, so, if you would...

11:36.700 --> 11:38.233
-Okay.
-Now, I'm just gonna recap here.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.333
I did ask you to come up

11:39.400 --> 11:40.833
-with a two-digit number...
-Yes, you did.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.600
-...between 25 and 100...
-Yes, you did.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.900
...and nobody did see this number,
is that correct?

11:44.967 --> 11:46.867
-That's correct. No one has.
-Okay, I'm glad.

11:46.933 --> 11:48.067
I'm gonna tear this up
right in front of you

11:48.133 --> 11:51.333
so nobody else is gonna know.
There we go. Perfect.

11:51.967 --> 11:54.000
Now I'm gonna need your hands for this.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.300
Just like this. Perfect.

11:55.367 --> 11:57.067
Now, there's three reasons
why I'm gonna hold your hands.

11:57.267 --> 11:58.667
-Okay.
-First reason is

11:58.733 --> 12:00.333
-you have a fabulous manicure.
-Well, thank you.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.600
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Second reason is,

12:01.667 --> 12:04.600
I'm actually feeling little
micro-twitches in your pulse right now...

12:04.667 --> 12:06.100
-Yep.
-...and the third reason is

12:06.167 --> 12:07.233
I just wanted to hold your hands.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.333
-Oh, that's nice.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:08.400 --> 12:10.167
Yeah, so, now,
I just want you to concentrate

12:10.233 --> 12:11.900
-on your number for me, okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

12:11.967 --> 12:14.000
Concentrate...

12:14.400 --> 12:15.733
(AUDIENCE GASP)

12:16.467 --> 12:17.600
That's pretty hot.

12:17.667 --> 12:18.767
-PENN: Mmm-hmm.
-All right!

12:19.200 --> 12:21.800
Now, I definitely got something from you.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.100
Uh, I don't have a timer,
so what I'm gonna have you do

12:24.167 --> 12:25.667
is you're gonna time me, okay?

12:25.733 --> 12:27.767
You're gonna count one, one thousand,
two, one thousand.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.867
Or if you like "Mississippi"
or "hippopotamus", it's up to you.

12:29.967 --> 12:31.000
I like all those things.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.300
Okay!

12:32.367 --> 12:33.500
So just start counting
whenever you're ready

12:33.567 --> 12:35.300
and I'll tell you when to stop, all right?

12:35.500 --> 12:37.200
-Whenever you're ready.
-Start!

12:37.267 --> 12:39.767
-(DRAWING)
-One Mississippi, two Mississippi,

12:39.833 --> 12:44.600

five Mississippi, six Mississippi,

12:48.533 --> 12:49.900
-Done.
-...ten...

12:49.967 --> 12:53.067
Nine Mississippi hippopotamuses. Okay.

12:53.733 --> 12:55.067
Now, I'm sure you're familiar

12:55.133 --> 12:56.700
-with Las Vegas.
-Yeah.

12:56.767 --> 12:59.600
Well, I gave myself
16 different chances to hit your number.

12:59.700 --> 13:00.767
Okay.

13:00.833 --> 13:03.967
So, do you see your number in this box?

13:04.033 --> 13:05.467
-I, uh...
-In these boxes?

13:05.533 --> 13:07.000
-I don't.
-(AUDIENCE MURMURS)

13:07.067 --> 13:08.300
What was your number?

13:08.367 --> 13:11.033
-My number was 26.
-Twenty six.

13:11.467 --> 13:12.933
I'm gonna put
your number right there. There...

13:13.000 --> 13:15.100
-That way it is on the page, 26.
-Okay.

13:15.167 --> 13:16.233
-Okay, I see that, yeah.
-Better?

13:16.300 --> 13:18.633
Okay, so let me just show you
something really cool, okay?

13:18.733 --> 13:20.700
-And this, I'm very proud of this.
-Okay.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.733
-How 'bout six and one is seven...
-Yeah.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.000
...plus 12 is 19,

13:25.067 --> 13:27.000
-plus seven is 26.
-Twenty six.

plus three is 18 plus eight is...

13:33.900 --> 13:34.967

-Twenty-six here. Twenty-six there.
-Twenty-six there.

13:49.467 --> 13:53.000
Now, Tivo,
you guys can Tivo this if you want to.

13:53.067 --> 13:54.733
Pause it, this is all correct.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.333
But let's take it a step further.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.567
How about six and eight
is 14 plus three

13:58.633 --> 14:00.767
is 17 plus nine, 26.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.933

plus 10 plus four, 26.

Now, we won't stop there. There's more.

Six plus seven is 13
plus four is 21 plus five is...

-I think you get the point.
-I do.

14:25.467 --> 14:30.067
There is over 26 different ways
to equal 26 in 10 seconds.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.767
-Beautifully done.
-Not too bad, not too bad at all.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.900
Now, with that, Penn,
I'm gonna say thank you.

14:38.967 --> 14:40.833
I'm gonna let you go
and sit in your comfy chair again.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.500
Let's give him a round of applause.
Thank you so much.

14:42.567 --> 14:43.567
I'll miss you.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.800
Teller, for my spot with you,
I'm gonna actually have you

14:49.867 --> 14:51.367
join me right here
on the front of the stage, okay?

14:51.633 --> 14:53.333
Bring your drawing with you.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.800
Don't show it to anyone.

14:54.867 --> 14:57.667
There's a certain way
that I like to absorb information,

14:57.733 --> 14:59.867
so I'm gonna have you turn around for me.

15:02.033 --> 15:03.500
Now I'm gonna turn around.

Let me just...
I just gotta get into position, hang on.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.867
I'm definitely starting to feel something.

15:14.933 --> 15:17.800
Yep, okay. Now, let me just...

15:19.133 --> 15:20.267
...see...

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
...here...

15:22.067 --> 15:23.933
Yep, I'm getting a stronger feeling.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.933
All right. I'm gonna lock in my answer.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.067
I definitely got
a really good feeling out of that.

15:32.133 --> 15:34.233
I don't know about you guys. (CHUCKLES)

15:34.300 --> 15:37.333
But, for the first time, Teller,
will you ple...

15:37.400 --> 15:38.933
Don't say anything yet.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.567
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

15:40.633 --> 15:43.500
Will you please show the audience
what it is that you drew?

15:44.700 --> 15:45.767
What do we got?

15:45.833 --> 15:47.300
A flower!

15:48.233 --> 15:50.833
-It's so interesting...
-(AUDIENCE GASP AND CHEER)

15:50.900 --> 15:53.467
...that I would have
gotten a flower as well.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.167
Teller, thank you so much. Thank you, sir.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.533
JONATHAN: Amazing Allison,
ladies and gentlemen!

16:03.867 --> 16:05.333
-Fabulous! That was great.
-Thank you.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.367
That was incredible,

16:07.433 --> 16:10.733
and I have never seen Teller
that happy before.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.100
-Wow.
-(ALLISON CHUCKLES)

16:12.167 --> 16:13.400
I know they loved the act

16:13.467 --> 16:16.167
'cause I could tell
from the expression on both their faces.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.467
-Penn, what do you have to say?
-I was kind of, uh,

16:18.533 --> 16:22.167
flying more solo
than I usually am on this.

16:22.233 --> 16:25.800
I got much less help from Teller,
'cause all Teller wanted to talk about

16:25.867 --> 16:27.800
was how much he liked rubbing against you.

16:27.867 --> 16:29.300
(ALL LAUGHING)

16:29.367 --> 16:30.800
Which, I didn't get to do that,

16:30.867 --> 16:32.633
-so I...
-I held your hands.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.767
I know you held my hand.

16:33.833 --> 16:35.100
I wanted to rub your ass.

PENN: You just took...

16:46.733 --> 16:48.933
-You took two tricks...
-Yes.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.967
...that are
for what we'll call my section...

16:52.033 --> 16:53.500
-Mmm-hmm.
-...the, what we call

16:53.567 --> 16:56.267
the less creative section.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.867
You know a "magic square",
we happen to know.

16:59.933 --> 17:01.967
-Yeah.
-It's a wonderful thing, it's a great, uh,

17:02.033 --> 17:04.267
it's a great mental exercise,
did a beautiful job with it.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.300
-And using that as a revelation...
-Thank you. Mmm.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.400
...after you do a center peek is fabulous.

17:08.467 --> 17:09.867
-Thank you.
-Wonderful, great.

17:09.933 --> 17:14.233
And Teller has a pretty good idea
how you, how you did his part,

17:14.300 --> 17:16.599
and he's gonna lay it on you right now.

17:16.666 --> 17:17.967
Lay it on me, buddy.

17:18.967 --> 17:20.599
Let's see if he's right there.

-There you go.

-Thank you, sir.

-...keep that a...
-Oh, oh!

17:29.100 --> 17:31.167
-He'll keep that a secret there.
-(GASPS)

17:32.500 --> 17:34.100

Thank you for sharing it with us.

-Ladies and gentlemen, Amazing Allison!
-Thank you.

17:44.267 --> 17:46.800
Now, if this next performer
doesn't put a smile on your face,

17:46.867 --> 17:48.700
then frankly, it's a waste of a face.

18:08.067 --> 18:10.800
It's friendly, but it also
sets the bar pretty low.

18:10.867 --> 18:14.067
Penn and I have known each other
since the late '80s, I think.

18:14.133 --> 18:17.767
<i>It's much harder to fool somebody</i>
<i>that knows you,</i>

18:17.833 --> 18:19.000
but I think it's not bragging to say

18:19.067 --> 18:21.167
that I've fooled Penn and Teller
many times in the past.

18:21.233 --> 18:24.533
<i>You know, Teller has, in fact</i>
<i>told me that I fooled him.</i>

18:24.600 --> 18:28.300
<i>And I do have one brand-new trick,</i>
<i>and I'm hoping to fool Teller.</i>

18:28.367 --> 18:31.867
'Cause as you know, if you fool Teller,
you fool Penn and Teller.

18:57.433 --> 18:59.367
No, I'm really excited
because I do have a brand-new trick,

18:59.433 --> 19:00.767
and I don't know
whether you guys know this,

19:00.900 --> 19:04.967
every brand-new trick
requires a guinea pig.

19:05.033 --> 19:06.567

-Del Marlow.
-Say it again?

19:11.033 --> 19:13.100
-Del Marlow.
-Del Marlow, follow me.

Ladies and gentlemen, today's volunteer
who did not volunteer in any way,

19:20.033 --> 19:22.033
and, uh, right over this way, Del Marlow.

19:22.100 --> 19:25.233
Somewhere over here
near that yellow dot is probably great.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.800
Nice to meet you.
Thanks for comin' up.

19:26.867 --> 19:29.467
Del Marlow, uh,
you'll notice in this trick,

19:29.533 --> 19:32.400
many of the things I say
have more than one meaning,

19:32.600 --> 19:35.300
-like "guinea pig".
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

19:35.367 --> 19:37.400
Uh, do you know anything
about the other kind of guinea pigs,

19:37.467 --> 19:39.700
the little furry pets?
Do you know what they eat?

19:40.133 --> 19:42.733
-Pet food.
-"Pet food" is a good guess. (CHUCKLES)

19:43.433 --> 19:44.467
I'll give you a hint.

19:44.533 --> 19:45.800
See if you can guess now
what guinea pigs eat.

19:46.233 --> 19:47.400
-Oats?
-"Oats"?

19:47.467 --> 19:49.433
-Sorry, no. They eat Fig Newtons.

make sure there are no Fig Newtons,

19:51.967 --> 19:53.600
no guinea pigs, no oats.

19:53.667 --> 19:57.733
That is an empty cardboard oatmeal tub
like you would make a drum out of, maybe,

19:57.800 --> 19:59.167
when you were a little boy.

19:59.233 --> 20:01.867
-Or yesterday, were you me.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

20:01.933 --> 20:04.433
Uh, Del Marlow, the new magic trick
is in three parts.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.500
For the first part, the guessing game,
we need two things.

20:07.567 --> 20:09.867
Oatmeal tub and a small ball.

20:09.933 --> 20:12.367
Del Marlow, do you have a small...

20:13.367 --> 20:15.000
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

20:16.267 --> 20:19.767
Perhaps I can manufacture a small ball
from a paper serviette.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.567
That means "napkin".

20:21.633 --> 20:25.933
I roll the serviette into a small ball,
and I seal the end with spit-teel.

20:27.867 --> 20:29.967
That means... "Bleh!"

20:30.367 --> 20:32.633
Del Marlow, here's the premise
of our little guessing game.

20:32.700 --> 20:35.800
I'm gonna rattle the small ball
around inside the oatmeal tub,

20:35.867 --> 20:37.567
then I'm gonna put it in my pocket.

20:37.633 --> 20:39.933
You have to decide if that ball
stays in my pocket

20:40.000 --> 20:43.933
or if I've somehow snuck it back
under the oatmeal tub.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.533
So it's like the old three-shell game,
you remember that?

20:46.600 --> 20:50.600
Now, there's only one shell,
so the odds are infinitely better for you.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.233
We'll see.
But you understand the rules, right?

20:53.333 --> 20:55.700
I'm gonna rattle it around,
I'm gonna put it in my pocket,

20:55.767 --> 20:57.000
you decide if it stays here

20:57.067 --> 20:59.100
or if I've snuck it back
under the oatmeal tub.

20:59.167 --> 21:00.900
You understand the premise
of the guessing game?

21:00.967 --> 21:02.100
-Yes, sir.
-Then we'll begin.

21:02.167 --> 21:04.800
There's an oatmeal tub
and a small ball.

21:05.267 --> 21:07.133
-(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
-Oh!

21:09.967 --> 21:11.500
So I'll rattle it around a little bit.

21:11.567 --> 21:15.667
Would you say right now
that ball was in my pocket

21:15.900 --> 21:18.667
or under the oatmeal tub?

21:19.567 --> 21:21.000
I would say it's still under there.

21:21.067 --> 21:22.400
You say it's under the tub.

21:22.467 --> 21:24.133
Dude, I just showed you...

21:24.200 --> 21:25.433
(LAUGHTER)

21:26.400 --> 21:27.433
That's sharp.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.467
You were thinking, "I'm gonna
be wrong no matter what," weren't ya?

21:30.567 --> 21:32.800
That is true, you would have
been wrong, no matter what.

21:32.867 --> 21:34.467
Hold that for just a second.

21:34.867 --> 21:37.100
Now comes the magic-trick part.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.033
For the magic-trick part,
we need two more things.

21:39.100 --> 21:41.600
One from my grandmother...

21:43.733 --> 21:45.533
(LAUGHTER)

21:45.933 --> 21:48.033
The drapes match the couch.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.667
(LAUGHTER)

21:50.167 --> 21:51.367
And one...

21:51.433 --> 21:53.600
One from my grandfather.

21:53.867 --> 21:56.900
This is his glass for his teeth.

21:57.633 --> 21:59.367
-(LAUGHTER)
-Tooth, actually.

22:00.167 --> 22:02.767
That gets covered with the drapery,
goes in the center of the stool.

22:02.833 --> 22:05.267
Del Marlow, reach over, feel that cloth
above the opening of the glass.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.367
Make sure there are no slits
or holes or trapdoors.

22:08.433 --> 22:10.233
-Solid piece of cloth, correct?
-Yes, sir.

22:10.300 --> 22:13.600
The reason I had you verify that
is the magic we're going to do

22:13.667 --> 22:17.200
is the magic of penetration.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.500

22:20.633 --> 22:22.533
-It's a crowd favorite.
-I see.

22:23.067 --> 22:25.933
Del Marlow, I don't know how much
you know about penetration.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.533
(LAUGHTER)

22:28.233 --> 22:31.300
I've heard it's easier in the dark.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.567
Now, Del Marlow,
do you have any secret magic moves

22:34.633 --> 22:36.600
that you do that would aid penetration?

-Yeah.

you're doing, well done.

Del Marlow, with your, ha, there you go.

22:52.267 --> 22:55.300
With your left hand, reach over,
grab the left corner of the cloth.

22:55.367 --> 22:56.833
Right hand grabs the right corner,

slowly, so as to not tip over
my family heirloom

22:59.967 --> 23:01.600

23:01.667 --> 23:03.800

28:18.600 --> 28:21.267
where a magician
takes a piece of silverware

28:21.333 --> 28:23.000
and bends it with his mind.

28:23.067 --> 28:25.033
I'm gonna take it one step
further for you tonight.

28:25.100 --> 28:31.000
Instead of bending this fork with my mind,
I'm gonna bend your mind with this fork.

28:31.533 --> 28:33.000
-(LAUGHTER)
-Deep, huh?

28:33.067 --> 28:35.500
Instead of using a real fork,
I'm gonna use an imaginary fork.

28:35.567 --> 28:37.333
I'm gonna draw a picture for us tonight.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.867
Hopefully resembles a fork.
Here we go.

28:40.833 --> 28:43.200
Oh, looks more like a spork.

28:43.267 --> 28:46.033
But that's all right.
That's the best I can do.

28:46.533 --> 28:49.500
There it is, right there,
ladies and gentlemen, my spork.

28:49.733 --> 28:50.867
-(APPLAUSE)
-It's all right.

28:52.267 --> 28:53.633
It's missing something.

28:53.700 --> 28:54.833
It needs to be more unique.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.567
Jonathan, would you mind
helping me with this?

28:56.633 --> 28:58.533
-Round of applause for Jonathan, please.
-Thank you.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.100
Jonathan, please stand
on that side of the table.

29:00.167 --> 29:01.233
Stand here?

29:01.300 --> 29:04.400
Can you sign your name nice and big
on that line so we can all see?

29:04.467 --> 29:05.467
Okay.

29:06.333 --> 29:07.967
Excellent. Thank you very much.

29:08.033 --> 29:09.667
I'll take the marker.
We'll get rid of this.

29:09.733 --> 29:11.967
This is now a work of art.
One in a million.

29:12.033 --> 29:13.833
Nothing else looks like this in the world.

29:13.933 --> 29:16.267
Keep this in mind.
This is a real permanent marker.

29:16.333 --> 29:19.100
Nothing rubs off or moves
or does anything strange.

29:19.167 --> 29:20.633
Get a good look at my spork.

29:20.733 --> 29:23.500
Get a good look at
Jonathan's hieroglyphic.

29:23.567 --> 29:25.400
Remember everything you can about it.

29:25.467 --> 29:27.733
You're gonna want to recognize it
when you see it again.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.133
I don't want you to think I can do
anything without you knowing,

29:30.200 --> 29:31.333
so I'm gonna fold it up.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.833
Jonathan, if you can just hold on to this
nice and tight for us, stay right there.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.200
Don't move. Perfect.

29:36.267 --> 29:40.200
I'm gonna try to alter that drawing
in your minds with this fork.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.633
I want everyone to, for a moment,
imagine this fork

29:44.000 --> 29:46.333
is the same spork that I drew over there.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.067
I'm gonna call it a fork from now on.

29:48.133 --> 29:50.367
Imagine that fork is getting soft.

29:50.433 --> 29:53.800
Imagine it's getting so soft
where it starts to bend.

29:54.500 --> 29:58.800
Imagine the ink on the paper
is bending all the way

29:58.867 --> 30:01.233
until it's completely messed up.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.267
Everyone imagine that?

30:03.333 --> 30:05.200
Let's see what happened over here.

30:05.267 --> 30:07.133
Remember what this drawing
looked like earlier?

30:07.200 --> 30:10.133
Well, now, it's completely bent.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.600
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
-Thank you very much.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.600
-Norman Ng, ladies and gentlemen.
-Thank you.

30:16.533 --> 30:18.000
First of all, I've got to
congratulate you.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.800
I think the greatest trick you pulled off
is being about 12 years old

30:20.867 --> 30:22.033
-and having four children.
-That's right.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.300
-(LAUGHTER)
-How do you manage that?

30:24.367 --> 30:26.233
-Don't give me the details.
-I spend a lot of time on the road.

30:27.733 --> 30:28.967
If your kids see Dad fool them,

30:29.033 --> 30:30.500
will that make them want to follow
in your footsteps?

30:30.567 --> 30:32.567
Maybe. That'd be pretty awesome, though.

30:32.633 --> 30:34.433
I don't know, Penn and Teller,
they're smart,

30:34.500 --> 30:35.733
I've looked up to them since I was a kid.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.067
I did my best. We'll see what happens.

30:38.133 --> 30:41.700
You know, Norman did not expect us
to bust him on the bending the fork.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.167
That is something he knows we know.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.367
It's this other trick.

30:45.433 --> 30:49.900
And, you know, I'm not even
going to address Norman on this,

30:49.967 --> 30:52.167
because you've got a miracle
in your hands.

30:52.233 --> 30:55.100
So, Jonathan, one of these days,

30:55.167 --> 30:59.233
I'm gonna take you, Jonathan,
out to lunch.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.700
-And I am going to explain to you...
-Hold on, hold on...

31:02.767 --> 31:03.933
...when we are out to lunch...

31:04.000 --> 31:06.733
That's not a euphemism
for something weird, is it?

31:06.800 --> 31:10.833
It is. It is a euphemism
for something very, very weird,

31:10.967 --> 31:14.400
and when I take you out to lunch,
I'll tell you that the original trick

31:14.467 --> 31:16.333
is not as smart as this.

31:16.733 --> 31:21.867
'Cause the original trick has to have
another piece of apparatus on it.

31:21.967 --> 31:26.267
But when we're out to lunch,
I will tell you how clever he was

31:26.333 --> 31:28.900
with some of his masking
when we're out to lunch.

31:29.133 --> 31:32.933
But first, let's see if Norman thinks
we know what he did for that trick.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.533
You know it. I did not fool you.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.100
I wish I was invited to lunch.

31:36.167 --> 31:38.200
(LAUGHTER)

31:38.267 --> 31:40.600
Just by talking about lunch,
you understood what he was talking about?

31:40.667 --> 31:43.167
-I did, yes.
-What's wrong with you people?

31:43.233 --> 31:44.633
(LAUGHTER)

31:45.567 --> 31:47.867
Well, it's no wonder
none of you got friends.

31:47.933 --> 31:49.567
(LAUGHTER)

31:49.633 --> 31:51.300
Thank you for being here.
Norman Ng, ladies and gentlemen.

31:51.367 --> 31:52.867
Thank you, Penn and Teller!
Thank you, everyone.

31:53.133 --> 31:54.133
Fabulous!

31:57.567 --> 32:01.933
Ladies and gentlemen, they have been
working here for over 40 years,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.933
and they just got the trick
they're about to perform right once,

32:05.033 --> 32:07.100
and that was yesterday...
So let's see how it goes.

32:07.167 --> 32:10.033
Let's go crazy for Penn and Teller!

32:10.100 --> 32:11.967
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

32:12.367 --> 32:14.800
I'm gonna pick somebody
from the audience here.

32:14.867 --> 32:17.900
Um, let me see who we got here
for this, uh...

32:17.967 --> 32:20.167
-Yeah, what's your name, please?
-Brianna.

32:20.233 --> 32:21.533
Brianna, come here,
would you, please, Brianna?

32:21.900 --> 32:24.133
Now, watch your step here, Brianna,
if you trip and fall,

32:24.200 --> 32:26.333
it'll be on YouTube within an hour.
Right up here, Brianna.

32:27.267 --> 32:29.200
Brianna, this is Teller.
Teller, this is Brianna.

32:29.267 --> 32:31.367
She claims to be from the audience.

32:31.433 --> 32:32.600
We have a role for which you're cut out,

32:32.667 --> 32:34.533
you just match the silhouette
as best you can, Brianna.

32:35.033 --> 32:37.233
Beautiful.
This hand goes up like this.

32:37.300 --> 32:39.733
Beautiful. Right there.
This hand goes right on your hip.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.333
And all you've gotta do
in this whole trick

32:41.400 --> 32:45.333
is just stay really really still, okay?
Really, really still.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.667
I'm gonna throw these knives around you.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.467
I'm gonna throw them one at a time.

32:49.533 --> 32:51.400
I'm gonna count to three before each one,

32:51.467 --> 32:54.833
and all's you gotta do is stay
really, really still, okay?

32:55.433 --> 32:56.567
Just don't move at all.

32:56.633 --> 33:00.800
And... Watch yourself, Teller.
You're right in the, yeah.

33:00.867 --> 33:02.233
Here we go, Brianna. And...

33:02.300 --> 33:03.400
One! Two! Three...

33:03.500 --> 33:06.333
Brianna, you were doing beautifully,
then at some point,

33:06.400 --> 33:09.033
you moved this hand down
three or four inches.

33:09.100 --> 33:12.000
That's all well and good, Brianna,
except I was aiming right here.

33:13.100 --> 33:16.067
And if you'd have moved that arm down
when that knife was in the air

33:16.133 --> 33:19.667
and that knife had stuck in your arm,
you'd be running all over Vegas saying,

33:19.733 --> 33:23.533
"You know that big guy in Penn and Teller?
He stuck a knife in my arm."

33:23.767 --> 33:25.600
It wouldn't really be the whole truth,
would it, Brianna,

33:25.667 --> 33:29.300
because the big guy in Penn and Teller,
his aim was true,

33:29.367 --> 33:31.033
and you moved your arm into the path.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.300
See, even if you make
the mistake, Brianna,

33:33.367 --> 33:35.767
I'm still the one who's gonna
be blamed, okay? So...

33:37.333 --> 33:39.500
-Was she looking around?
-Yeah.

33:39.567 --> 33:40.633
That's why the hand...

33:40.700 --> 33:41.933
Okay, we're gonna
put a blindfold on you, Brianna.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.500
Teller thinks it'll make it easier for you
to, uh, you to focus and concentrate.

33:45.567 --> 33:47.633
Keep that hand right there.
That's perfect there, Brianna.

33:47.700 --> 33:48.733
And right there over your eyes.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.367
Is that blindfold on you
properly there, Brianna?

33:50.433 --> 33:52.233
-Mmm-hmm.
-Stay still, right there, Brianna.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.600
Just stay really, really still.
Here we go, Brianna.

33:54.667 --> 33:56.033
And...

33:56.567 --> 33:57.633
(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

33:58.133 --> 34:00.633
One! Two! Three! (GRUNTS)

34:00.700 --> 34:02.467
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
-Oh, beautiful, Brianna.

34:02.533 --> 34:04.867
Lift the blindfold up.
Right where I told you, Brianna.

34:04.933 --> 34:07.767
Beautifully done.
We're gonna do that twice more, Brianna.

34:07.833 --> 34:10.567
-Oh.
-Yeah, let's put the blindfold on.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.833
I think that helped the trick a lot.
Yeah, right there.

34:12.900 --> 34:14.867
And this hand right in position. Perfect.

34:14.933 --> 34:17.867
And this hand goes right on your hip.
Gonna be here this time, okay?

34:17.933 --> 34:19.667
-All right.
-Stay nice and still there, Brianna.

34:19.733 --> 34:21.967
There we go, Brianna. And...

34:23.400 --> 34:25.367
One! Two! Three! (GRUNTS)

34:25.900 --> 34:28.132
Oh, beautiful, Brianna.
Take a look there, Brianna.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.433
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
-Take a look.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.833
Beautifully done, right down there.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.766
You know, Brianna,
even though we just met,

34:34.467 --> 34:36.333
-I'm really starting to trust you.
-Oh.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.167
I'm gonna do something
that requires a lot of trust.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.100
I'm gonna throw right next
to your face, okay, Brianna?

34:41.167 --> 34:43.766
Just like this.
This hand goes right up here.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.100
This hand right here.
And stay very, very still.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.600
Keep your head very, very still.

34:47.667 --> 34:50.266
Here we go, Brianna. And...

34:51.766 --> 34:55.033
I'm so sorry. I'm a million miles away.
Here we go.

34:55.100 --> 34:56.632
Nice and still there, Brianna. And...

34:57.667 --> 34:59.533
One! Two! Three! (GRUNTS)

35:00.900 --> 35:02.633
We're cool, go, Brianna,
take a look there, Brianna.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.200
-(APPLAUSE)
-Take a look. Beautifully done.

35:04.267 --> 35:06.133
Brianna, beautifully done.

35:07.433 --> 35:10.300
You are so good at this, Brianna,
it's like you're...

35:11.167 --> 35:12.867
It's like you're a natural-born target
or something.

35:12.933 --> 35:14.500
-(LAUGHTER)
-You're just wonderful.

35:14.567 --> 35:16.367
I know you know something
fishy's going down.

35:16.433 --> 35:18.167
First of all,
the reaction of the audience,

35:18.233 --> 35:19.700
but also you're a smart woman.

35:19.933 --> 35:25.467
You know, a big corporation like the CW
could never allow some whack job

35:25.533 --> 35:29.700
to actually put a human being
in jeopardy without major kickbacks.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.667
I'll explain to you
how the trick was done.

35:31.733 --> 35:32.933
I don't know if you can
remember this, Brianna.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.167
When I first brought you up here,
I stood on this side of you,

35:36.567 --> 35:39.533
which is very bad staging, Brianna.
I'm twice your size.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.267
People over here can't see at all.

35:41.367 --> 35:43.267
Wanted to keep you upstage
so you wouldn't notice this.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.200
An electrical cable.

35:45.267 --> 35:47.867
'Cause we knew that
if you saw electric power

35:47.933 --> 35:51.100
run into a board with no lights on it,
you'd figure out immediately

35:51.167 --> 35:56.433
that behind that board is
a powerful array of electromagnets.

35:56.500 --> 36:00.667
But, Brianna, backstage, there's a
gentleman by the name of Nathan Santucci

36:00.733 --> 36:03.433
-who's our director of covert activities.
-(LAUGHTER)

36:03.500 --> 36:06.167
He has control over all these magnets
from backstage,

36:06.233 --> 36:07.267
and that's why I was counting,

36:07.867 --> 36:09.867
-so he knows just when I'm gonna throw.
-Ah!

36:09.933 --> 36:12.133
Nate, let's show Brianna upper right,
upper right.

36:12.200 --> 36:16.100
One, two, three! It sucks it right up
there so we can't possibly miss.

36:16.167 --> 36:17.367
And then just let it go, let it go,
let it go.

36:17.433 --> 36:20.067
So all I have to do, Brianna,
is throw at the right time.

36:20.433 --> 36:24.300
Once this whole thing is set up like this,
anyone in the world can throw knives.

36:24.367 --> 36:25.767
-Ah.
-Wanna give it a try?

36:25.833 --> 36:27.533
-Sure.
-Come with me, Brianna.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.267
Put your left foot right on that pink line
right there, would you please, Brianna?

36:31.333 --> 36:32.733
Put your right foot back for balance.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.400
Put this arm by your side for balance.

36:34.467 --> 36:36.100
-You ever throw a baseball, Brianna?
-Yeah.

36:36.167 --> 36:37.733
-You can throw overhand, right?
-Yes.

36:37.800 --> 36:38.867
Okay. So your part looks like this.

36:39.167 --> 36:41.333
One, two, three! Foom!

36:41.633 --> 36:43.667
Except, with luck
you'll throw toward the board

36:43.733 --> 36:45.067
and not directly into the audience...

36:45.200 --> 36:46.667
(LAUGHS)

36:46.733 --> 36:48.367
-We're gonna do a dry run.
-Okay.

36:48.433 --> 36:49.767
-Not gonna really throw this time.
-Okay.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.433
Just gonna fake it.
Of course, I'll be standing here,

36:51.500 --> 36:55.267
so you can't throw, 'cause
at this distance, it's not called a throw.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.600
-This distance it's called a stab.
-Okay.

36:57.667 --> 37:00.333
So we're gonna have you
just mime it here, Brianna.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.633
Just gonna make sure
you have the timing right.

37:01.700 --> 37:03.100
I'm counting, you're throwing.

37:03.200 --> 37:06.000
One, two, three. You're dead-on.

37:06.067 --> 37:08.667
Gonna really throw this next time,
really throw hard, okay?

37:08.733 --> 37:11.700
Here we go.
Safety's off, Nate, we're really going.

37:11.767 --> 37:13.633
I'm counting. Listen to me.

37:13.700 --> 37:16.300
Gonna throw right after three,
okay, Brianna?

37:16.367 --> 37:18.033
Here we go, Brianna, and...

37:19.233 --> 37:22.633
What are you doing? When I left you here,
Brianna, you were perfect.

37:23.033 --> 37:24.167
-(LAUGHS)
-But as soon as I got ready to do

37:24.233 --> 37:27.367
the actual trick, your eyes,
they went bug nutty, okay?

37:27.433 --> 37:28.500
(LAUGHTER)

37:28.567 --> 37:30.833
I just want you
to ignore me entirely, okay?

37:30.933 --> 37:33.033
The magnets do all the tricks
you need to...

37:33.100 --> 37:35.133
What are you doing, Teller?
You're distracting me.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.633
-I'm trying...
-(SPEAKS SOFTLY)

37:36.700 --> 37:38.067
Man, you're smart!

37:38.133 --> 37:40.133
We're gonna put a blindfold
on you here, Brianna.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.500
Teller thinks this'll help you a lot.

37:41.567 --> 37:43.367
-Is that on you properly there, Brianna?
-Mmm-hmm.

37:43.433 --> 37:45.833
Okay, good. You're gonna really throw
this time, okay, Brianna?

37:45.900 --> 37:48.267
And I don't mean to embarrass you,
but your hand's a little bit sweaty.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.967
Just gonna dry your hand off a little bit
so you have a nice, clean release.

37:51.033 --> 37:53.533
There we go, Brianna. You're gonna
throw right after three, really throw.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.000
-(LAUGHTER)
-Really throw this time.

37:55.067 --> 37:58.900
Here we go, here we go, Brianna.
Here we go, Brianna. And...

37:58.967 --> 38:01.200
One! Two! Three!

38:01.533 --> 38:03.800
Beautiful, Brianna.
Take a look there, Brianna. Take a look.

38:03.867 --> 38:06.100
-Perfectly done there, Brianna.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

38:06.167 --> 38:08.533
Beautifully done. You do that
twice more, Brianna, like that.

38:08.600 --> 38:09.667
Okay.

38:09.733 --> 38:11.967
Put that blindfold
back on you right there.

38:12.033 --> 38:13.533
Beautiful.
This arm by your side.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.233
Just grab the second knife here, Brianna.

38:16.300 --> 38:20.133
-(KNIFE CLUTTERS)
-Oh, man, oh, man. Um, um, um...

38:21.567 --> 38:22.733
Dropped my keys, Brianna.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.933
-Oh.
-Just dropped my keys.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.533
Here we go, Brianna.
Here we go, Brianna.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.767
And here we go, Brianna.

38:26.833 --> 38:28.767
And, and...

38:30.400 --> 38:31.933
One, two, three!

38:33.067 --> 38:36.167
Brianna, Brianna, Brianna,
Brianna, Brianna, Brianna!

38:36.233 --> 38:37.967
-Just another...
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

38:38.733 --> 38:41.133
Another few inches higher, Brianna,

38:41.200 --> 38:45.467
you'd have given this old atheist some
religion right up here on stage there.

38:45.533 --> 38:47.367
One more, Brianna.
Just pull that right down there.

38:47.433 --> 38:50.267
This is the last one.
I'm just gonna grab the third knife here.

38:50.333 --> 38:53.267
But remember, Brianna,
this is a three-person operation.

38:53.333 --> 38:56.500
It's just you, me, and the Santucci.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.800
You, me, and the Santucci.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.533
After three, after three.

39:01.700 --> 39:04.733
Here we go, Brianna.
Here we go, Brianna. And...

39:05.800 --> 39:07.667
One, two, three!

39:07.733 --> 39:09.733
-(GROANING)
-(AUDIENCE YELLING)

39:12.800 --> 39:14.967
You've killed me, Brianna!

39:15.033 --> 39:17.000
Nicely done, there, Brianna.
Beautifully done.

39:17.067 --> 39:18.600
-Watch your step.
-(APPLAUSE)

39:20.133 --> 39:21.167
Thank you, Nathan.

39:21.533 --> 39:25.133
Ladies and gentlemen, Penn and Teller!

39:25.200 --> 39:26.467
Fabulous.

39:26.667 --> 39:27.700
Great fun.

39:27.867 --> 39:29.400
Well, our magicians are finished

39:29.467 --> 39:31.233
and that's all the show
we have for you this evening.

39:31.300 --> 39:34.233
But we're just getting warmed up,
because this is Las Vegas, after all.

39:34.300 --> 39:36.167
See you next time with more <i>Fool Us.</i>

39:36.233 --> 39:38.233
