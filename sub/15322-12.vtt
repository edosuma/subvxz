WEBVTT

00:04.087 --> 00:05.918
Come on, Adrian.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.795
Maybe he's not home
from school yet.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.958
Adrian!

00:11.011 --> 00:12.421
It's Detective Linden!

00:14.139 --> 00:16.630
If you're here,
open up, please!

00:19.353 --> 00:21.264
Mrs. Clarke,
where's Adrian?

00:21.313 --> 00:22.473
We need to talk to him
right away.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.854
Well, he doesn't
want to talk to you.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.097
He doesn't need
any more reminders

00:25.108 --> 00:26.439
about what happened
to his father.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.604
Please, just leave him alone.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.443
Please, Mrs. Clarke,
this is very important.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.480
Maybe if you ask him
if he wants to talk to us?

00:32.491 --> 00:34.732
- He's not home.
- You sure about that?

00:34.785 --> 00:38.573
Whose backpack is that?

00:38.622 --> 00:40.078
That's his.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.079
But he always calls me
the minute he gets home.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.205
That's the rule.
Adﬂan?

00:43.252 --> 00:44.958
Could he have left,
gone to a friend's house?

00:45.003 --> 00:48.086
No. He's supposed to stay here
until I get back from work.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.458
Adrian? Honey?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.841
Adﬂan?

00:58.433 --> 01:01.049
Adrian?!

01:03.480 --> 01:05.141
He's not here.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.639
The back door was wide open.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.567
Hey.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.562
Where's mom?

01:54.615 --> 01:58.107
Just... wanted to spend some time
with my little girl.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.196
Mom said it was okay.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.286
How was class?

02:03.332 --> 02:05.448
Fine.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.411
Do you like the new teacher?

02:07.461 --> 02:10.294
That's jazz class.
This is ballet.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.628
Oh.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.799
Do you love her?

02:15.844 --> 02:18.631
Who?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.422
The woman from work?
With the hair.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.433
Mom told me.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.469
That's great, you know?

02:26.521 --> 02:28.728
We were supposed to
tell you together.

02:28.774 --> 02:32.232
Listen, just so you know,

02:32.277 --> 02:33.562
it's got nothing
to do with you.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.570
I don't know
if you could understand this...

02:36.615 --> 02:39.402
but I can't be something
that I'm not.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.362
I'm tired of it.

02:41.411 --> 02:45.029
Listen. But I will
always love you, honey.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.323
Always love you.

02:47.334 --> 02:51.452
I will always be the same person
you've known all your life.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.790
Nothing's gonna change that.
Whatever happens.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.750
Oh, my God, dad!
Everything's gonna change!

02:54.800 --> 02:56.791
Not my love--
not my love for you.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.629
Then why are you doing this?

03:11.566 --> 03:13.557
Lieutenant Skinner.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.225
It's a 20-minute walk home.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.228
He let himself in,
dumped his backpack in the hall,

03:17.239 --> 03:18.570
somebody came in and got him.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.234
Or the guy was already
in the house waiting for him.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.233
But either way, Adrian is gone.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.412
So it's been what?
An hour, hour and a half?

03:24.454 --> 03:26.911
- Neighbors see anything?
- So far, no, nothing.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.869
Jimmy?

03:29.918 --> 03:32.500
We got the wrong guy.
It's not Joe Mills.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.662
What are you talking about?

03:34.715 --> 03:35.955
He killed Angie Gower.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.463
That's the body that we found
in the car this morning.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.874
And now he's got Adrian.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.667
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.554
Slow down.
What are you talking about?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.592
Mills is in custody.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.100
We just filed charges
against him today.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.592
- It's not him.
- It's a cop.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.895
Come here.
Come here.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.398
Wait. W-what are you guys
talking about?

03:55.444 --> 03:56.479
What the hell
are you talking about?

03:56.570 --> 03:59.152
I know this is gonna sound
crazy, Loo,

03:59.197 --> 04:01.574
but there's a lot of things
pointing to Reddick.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.454
Okay, listen. I know you guys
had your differences, you know?

04:06.496 --> 04:07.611
It's not that.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.824
Just hear me out.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.826
He was the one that took
Bullet's final phone call.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.333
- He tried to dump the Ashley Kwon case...
- Right.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.243
...on Jablonski,
a total incompetent.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.667
Reddick knew the first victim.
He lived next door to her.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.377
He never told us anything
about this.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.087
He loses Angie Gower
at the hospital

04:21.136 --> 04:22.876
before the sketch artist
gets there.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.715
Angie was killed yesterday.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.347
And now Adrian's gone.
He is tying up loose ends.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.805
Okay, where's, uh--
where's Reddick now?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.143
We don't know.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.978
Look, I know this is
really bad timing.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.347
It's bad for the department
and for you.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.891
You think I give a shit
about that?

04:42.073 --> 04:44.564
Okay, look, you guys
cover the scene here.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.568
Look for the kid. I'll track
down Reddick. All right?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.486
Loo, I need to be the one
to talk to him.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.325
And I know he's got a girl
on the side,

04:51.374 --> 04:52.500
and I think I know
where she lives.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.624
No, no, you-- you two
stay on the case here.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.955
Look for Adrian.
I got to send a car out for him.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.542
No, 1-1 got to talk to him.
He was my partner.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.048
Even the more reason
for you to step off.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.379
- All right? Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.216
All right, now, we keep this
quiet between the three of us.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.381
And before we ruin a cop's life
and reputation,

05:09.434 --> 05:11.390
we want to make sure.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.552
'Cause so far
we don't have squat.

05:13.605 --> 05:14.640
All right?

05:14.689 --> 05:18.432
Detective Holder,
we got something.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.769
I promised
that I would keep him safe.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.947
Well, we're gonna find him,
trust me.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.735
Hey.
Gonna be all right.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.338
Adrian just knocked
on the door

05:42.342 --> 05:43.673
and asked if he could come in.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.666
That was unusual.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.004
Why--
did he say something

05:46.054 --> 05:47.339
to indicate he was scared?

05:47.389 --> 05:51.507
No. I mean,
he's shy, uh... but...

05:51.560 --> 05:53.425
He and Henry had had a couple
of play dates,

05:53.478 --> 05:54.718
but they didn't hit it off.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.398
And, yes, maybe he was scared,
I think.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.310
What do you mean?

05:59.359 --> 06:02.567
He said someone
was following him.

06:02.571 --> 06:06.063
Did he describe the person
or know who it was?

06:06.074 --> 06:07.905
No. I mean--

06:07.909 --> 06:10.366
Ijust thought, because
of what happened to his dad,

06:10.412 --> 06:11.697
that he was upset,

06:11.746 --> 06:13.873
and that maybe he didn't want to
go home to an empty house.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.871
I didn't see anyone
following him--

06:15.917 --> 06:18.203
Wait. You didn't let him
stay here?

06:18.211 --> 06:21.544
I had a doctor's appointment,
and Henry had karate,

06:21.548 --> 06:23.539
so I-I didn't let him
walk home alone.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.665
I gave him a ride.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.878
That was very kind of you.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.966
Did you see anyone
when you dropped him off?

06:30.015 --> 06:31.971
- No. - Maybe someone
parked in a car nearby?

06:32.017 --> 06:34.679
I'm sorry.
I didn't see anyone.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.595
All right. Thank you.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.601
I need that footage right away.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.274
DOT's sending footage
of traffic cams

06:46.281 --> 06:47.771
between the school
and Adrian's house,

06:47.782 --> 06:49.033
also the neighbor's house.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.066
Maybe we'll get a hit on
Reddick's car. What's he drive?

06:51.077 --> 06:52.738
Gray Crown Vic.
Still not picking up his phone.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.407
Yeah, you're not
supposed to be calling him.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.075
Whatever. Let's check
the traffic footage.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.242
Then I'm gonna take a drive.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.206
Got a feeling
where Reddick's holed up.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.914
- Detective Holder?
- Yeah, what up?

07:01.963 --> 07:03.248
I'm Investigator Alvarez.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.583
Guggenheim.
Internal Affairs.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.169
We need to speak to you,
Detective.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.206
About what?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.717
- You just come with us.
- What's going on?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.505
Another time, boys.
I'm working a job right now.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.172
So are we, and you don't
want to walk in there

07:14.225 --> 07:15.476
in cuffs, do you, Detective?

07:15.477 --> 07:17.559
Why are you stopping him?
On what grounds?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.720
I got this, Linden.
I'll catch you in a few.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.230
I'll call Skinner.
He'll clear it up.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.159
Any word from Skinner?
He's not back yet?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.710
Hey, Jimmy. It's me again.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.254
I need you to call me back
right away.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.255
Holder's been taken by IA
for questioning.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.087
I really need your help.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.422
All right, call me.
Please.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.592
You requested
the traffic-cam footage, Sarah?

07:58.645 --> 07:59.600
What?

07:59.646 --> 08:00.931
For the missing kid,
Adrian Seward.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.437
Yeah, yeah, I did.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.598
- This your kid?
- That's him.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.767
See this gray car
in the background?

08:06.820 --> 08:09.106
It shows up again...
here,

08:09.155 --> 08:11.817
near the neighbor's house
he went to.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.993
Have you seen Reddick?

08:14.035 --> 08:15.650
Skinner needs to talk to him.

08:15.704 --> 08:16.864
He's--
he's looking for him.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.699
Oh, he didn't mention anything
about that to me,

08:18.748 --> 08:20.613
but then again, he was in
a hurry to get out of here.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.664
Skinner was here?

08:21.710 --> 08:23.541
For a few minutes,
then he took off.

08:23.545 --> 08:27.538
Said something
about a family emergency.

08:27.549 --> 08:30.541
Can we blow up this car?
Get a better visual on it?

08:30.552 --> 08:32.213
Yeah, give it a shot.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.678
Look, just call my supervisor.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.684
He's gonna tell you what's what
so I can get out of here,

08:41.730 --> 08:45.939
and then you can go do
whatever it is that you do.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.102
It's come to our attention

08:47.152 --> 08:49.393
that you're harassing
your eX-partner, Carl Reddick.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.777
What?

08:50.822 --> 08:52.107
Is it true that you've made

08:52.157 --> 08:54.443
numerous threatening phone calls
to him and to his family?

08:54.492 --> 08:55.607
No.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.866
It seems you've, uh,

08:56.870 --> 08:59.532
developed some sort of fixation
with his daughter.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.122
What, Reddick told you that?

09:04.794 --> 09:08.207
You're serious?

09:08.256 --> 09:10.747
Mind if we take a look
at your phone?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.587
As long as you
don't mind the pictures

09:13.636 --> 09:15.888
of me banging your mama
last night.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.886
You assaulted Detective
Reddick in his own house

09:17.932 --> 09:19.763
in front of his family--
is that correct?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.094
Look, we had
a little misunderstanding,

09:21.144 --> 09:23.100
but we're cool, all right?

09:23.146 --> 09:25.307
Go talk to him
if you don't believe me.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.555
Better yet, bring him in here,

09:26.608 --> 09:29.350
and then we can all have
a little téte-a-tat.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.562
Yeah, well, Detective Reddick's

09:30.570 --> 09:31.901
not the one
under investigation here.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.073
Maybe he should be.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.630
James?

10:08.316 --> 10:10.932
What are you doing?

10:10.985 --> 10:12.270
Hey. What are you
doing here?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.777
Holder was taken by IA.
I've been calling you.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.939
They won't let me see him.
You've got to get him out.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.448
Yeah, I'll, uh--
yeah, I'll take care of it.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.950
The traffic cams show

10:20.995 --> 10:24.237
that there was a gray car
stalking Adrian.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.368
Here and-- and here.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.872
Could be anyone's car.
Doesn't mean it's Reddick's.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.453
Right?

10:33.341 --> 10:34.956
So after all this,

10:35.009 --> 10:36.965
it really does
come down to your career?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.967
Your reputation?

10:39.013 --> 10:41.004
Reopening the case
would be too messy?

10:41.057 --> 10:44.675
Yeah, you have no idea
what I'm thinking.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.934
Okay, so tell me because
I don't-- I don't understand.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.938
Just got to get out of here.
Things have blown up with Jen.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.939
Just-- just can't get into it
right now.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.771
James, right now
we need to find this car.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.108
- We need to find Adrian.
- And we will. I promise.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.113
I don't understand
why you're not doing anything!

10:59.159 --> 11:01.445
Because the case you and Holder
made against Reddick

11:01.494 --> 11:03.826
is appallingly weak
and circumstantial at best.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.239
Accusing a fellow cop
without hard evidence?

11:07.292 --> 11:08.532
I mean, I'm surprised at you,
Sarah.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.873
You used to be a thorough
and careful detective!

11:14.257 --> 11:16.373
Sorry you feel that way.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.547
Listen.
Wait, wait, wait.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.633
I'm sorry.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.968
I'm sorry.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.430
I'm just having a horrible day.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.770
I'm just trying to
keep it together, you know?

11:30.773 --> 11:33.105
And I believe you.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.441
Of course I do.
I believe you.

11:38.281 --> 11:41.614
You need to call IA.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.449
Yeah.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.943
Yeah.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.580
This is nice.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.502
Bethany...

11:58.551 --> 11:59.666
Bethany, come on.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.050
Wait a second.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.882
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Bethany.
Come here. Come here.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.718
Are you really leaving?

12:05.767 --> 12:07.007
Just for a little while.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.348
Just till your mom and I
have worked things out.

12:10.396 --> 12:14.685
Hey. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.476
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.479
Please don't go, daddy.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.151
It's gonna be all right. Okay?

12:22.158 --> 12:26.071
I love you, darling.
I love you so much.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.285
Hey.
It's gonna be all right.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.619
Okay?

12:35.922 --> 12:37.412
I'll see you soon, okay?

12:37.465 --> 12:38.750
Yeah.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.085
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.967
Yeah, it'll be all right.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.486
That was awful.
I'm sorry.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.104
You want to see him alive,
you'll come with me.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.912
Hand over your weapon.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.933
Where is he?

14:59.982 --> 15:01.597
Where is he?!

15:08.241 --> 15:10.357
Get your hands
behind your back.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.867
If you arrest me now,
you'll never see him again.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.324
He'll die out there alone.

15:23.965 --> 15:27.628
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

16:00.960 --> 16:03.451
Shooting up
with your CI's in '09.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.297
Caught lifting meth
from an evidence locker.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.586
You're a bona fide tweak head.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.920
I've been clean
for over two years.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.426
I got to get in touch
with my partner, okay?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.758
It's an emergency. Just give me
two minutes on the phone.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.047
You can talk to her
all you want

16:16.100 --> 16:17.260
once we're done here, Steve.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.550
Look, if the reason I'm here

16:18.603 --> 16:20.389
is because Reddick's been
feeding you a bunch of BS,

16:20.438 --> 16:21.518
then call Lieutenant Skinner

16:21.564 --> 16:23.179
and he'll set you straight,
all right?

16:23.232 --> 16:24.347
I got to get out of here.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.106
Hey, hey, sit down!

16:26.152 --> 16:29.269
Reddick didn't file the
complaint. Your lieutenant did.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.280
Skinner?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.817
That's right. So calling
him ain't gonna do jack, Steve.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.540
Open the door.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.577
Open the door.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.048
Open the door!

16:48.090 --> 16:50.297
No, you haven't got
anger-management issue.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.299
- Not one bit.
- Look, my partner's life is in danger,

16:52.345 --> 16:54.210
you dumb son of a bitch.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.213
Admit what you did
to Reddick, Steve.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.340
I mean, your own partner.

16:58.392 --> 17:02.180
I thought you two were tight,
loyal to the death.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.347
When did Skinner
file the complaint?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.436
Right before we swooped you up.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.436
So I don't think he's gonna come
and save you now.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.114
Look,
worst-case scenario--

17:16.118 --> 17:17.949
you'll sit in the tank
for 48 hours,

17:17.954 --> 17:20.616
see a shrink,
and you're back at your desk.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.454
What's the big deal?

17:25.211 --> 17:28.544
All right.
I might as well come clean.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.039
Good. Good.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.712
I guess it's just like
the stress of the job

17:33.761 --> 17:35.592
kind of got to me.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.253
Reddick can be
a mean son of a bitch--

17:37.306 --> 17:39.513
I mean a real dick.

17:39.559 --> 17:44.553
I planted a bomb
in Reddick's car this morning.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.308
You know the armory
at the station?

17:47.316 --> 17:48.817
It's four flash bangs light,

17:48.818 --> 17:50.308
and that's just
my ignition source.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.482
And, Alvarez,
I'd be real careful

17:53.489 --> 17:55.730
scrolling through my phone
right now.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.240
You might just set it off,
Holmes.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.617
Bullshit.

18:02.582 --> 18:06.166
Got about 35 minutes
until it's gonna blow.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.501
IfI were you, I'd get
my fat ass out of this room

18:09.547 --> 18:10.753
and go get Reddick.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.428
Where is he?!

18:26.480 --> 18:27.936
Where the hell
is that dickhead?!

18:27.982 --> 18:29.597
I know you've got him in here!

18:29.650 --> 18:32.266
Quit staring at me
like a bunch of schoolgirls!

18:32.320 --> 18:34.777
Huh?!
Where's Holder?!

18:34.822 --> 18:36.938
Reddick!

18:36.991 --> 18:38.447
We're dealing with it,
all right?

18:38.492 --> 18:39.948
I'm taking my wife
and kid bowling.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.609
Next thing I know the entire
bomb squad's all over my car,

18:41.662 --> 18:43.573
- and you're dealing with it?
- We couldn't take any chances.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.572
Holder's an idiot.
He's not Al-Qaeda.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.323
- Jesus!
- All right, calm-- calm down.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.332
Why don't you go take a breather
or something?

18:49.378 --> 18:51.630
Where are your brain trusts
getting your intel from, anyway?

18:51.631 --> 18:54.623
You couldn't solve a crime
if it fell out of the sky

18:54.675 --> 18:56.290
and sat on your face!

18:56.344 --> 18:59.757
My PBA rep's en route,
so I suggest you pull

18:59.805 --> 19:02.296
that tampon out of your ass
and cut him loose.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.012
You've reached the voicemai/
of Detective Sarah Linden.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.771
Come on, Linden. Pick up
your damn phone, all right?

19:09.815 --> 19:11.601
You son of a bitch, you scared
the crap out of my wife and kid.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.107
Deedee's still popping Xanax.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.892
It was a whack move, all right?

19:14.904 --> 19:18.271
I had to get out of there.
Look, I need your help.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.280
Hey, pal, that is the last favor
I will ever do for you.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.862
You need professional help.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.323
- Ray Seward's kid's gone missing.
- What are you talking about?

19:24.372 --> 19:26.488
I don't have time to explain,
but I need you to find him.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.992
Missing?
How long's he been gone?

19:28.042 --> 19:30.408
We got an APB out on him.
We got units on the street.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.743
Where the hell you going?

19:31.754 --> 19:35.246
I got to go find the son
of a bitch who set me up.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.547
No, you want to see Adrian,
you turn that off.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.715
Shut up.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.975
Now, Holder's a good cop.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.470
But he'll be a better one

19:50.564 --> 19:52.691
once he learns
a little self-control.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.227
You had him detained by IA.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.897
You were getting too close
too fast.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.441
Never wanted this to happen.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.114
Including kidnapping Adrian?

20:06.122 --> 20:07.578
Where is he?

20:07.581 --> 20:10.664
I understand
how upsetting this is,

20:10.710 --> 20:13.076
but your hands are trembling.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.041
It's making me
a little nervous.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.206
Blowing my brains out right now
is not gonna help anyone.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.420
So...

20:20.428 --> 20:24.012
We'll be there soon.
Don't worry.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.849
Yes. What is it?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.934
I'm Detective Stephen Holder.
Is your husband here?

20:34.984 --> 20:35.973
Oh, for Christ's sake.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.937
Don't you people
know how to use a phone?

20:37.987 --> 20:39.067
He's not answering his phone.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.354
Well, he's not here.
He left 20 minutes ago.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.567
Where'd he go?

20:42.616 --> 20:43.696
I don't know.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.449
Listen, lady.
You don't seem to understand.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.076
I need to know where the hell
your husband is right now.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.328
Then ask his girlfriend,

20:49.373 --> 20:51.955
and get your foot out of
the door before I break it.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.787
Wait. His girlfriend?

20:53.836 --> 20:55.326
Y-you're talking
about Detective Linden?

20:55.421 --> 20:57.912
Yes. Her.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.422
She was here?
They left together?

21:00.468 --> 21:01.423
Yes.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.020
What is wrong with you?

21:18.027 --> 21:19.267
Where's the lake house?

21:21.030 --> 21:22.645
Where's the lake house?

21:28.704 --> 21:32.322
You had to take
that case this morning.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.705
That changed everything.

21:33.793 --> 21:38.162
Now, why couldn't you
walk away?

21:38.214 --> 21:42.799
"Walk away."

21:42.843 --> 21:44.299
Things would be different
right now.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.336
For both of us.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.806
Well...

21:51.852 --> 21:53.808
I don't expect you
to understand.

21:53.854 --> 21:58.473
Understand what?
That you murdered 21 girls?

21:58.526 --> 22:00.642
No, I don ’t understand that.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.150
How could I understand that?!

22:02.196 --> 22:04.562
How could anybody
understand that?!

22:06.742 --> 22:08.482
How do I even know that
you're taking me to Adrian

22:08.577 --> 22:09.487
or that he's alive?

22:09.578 --> 22:12.866
You don't.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.372
But I told you he was.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.911
You used to trust me
implicitly, Sarah.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.373
This morning
in your kitchen--

22:24.426 --> 22:25.415
Don't do that.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.585
I-I thought
it was a beginning for us.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.424
Don't do that!

22:29.473 --> 22:31.680
I wanted to change for you.

22:31.725 --> 22:35.513
And I thought I could.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.396
'Cause I have been alone...

22:43.946 --> 22:47.279
for-- for too long.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.114
Fortoolong.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.743
And so have you.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.575
So have you.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.868
You and I are nothing alike.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.941
You have reached the voicemai/
of Detective Sarah Linden.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.773
Linden,
pick up your damn phone!

23:26.822 --> 23:28.107
...as soon as I can.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.613
Call me back.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.684
You think you know
what this is, Sarah?

24:09.156 --> 24:11.442
You don't.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.784
The first one was an accident.

24:15.829 --> 24:19.413
Her name was Brigitte.
It was Brigitte Delahanty.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.871
She was in
the Junior Officers program.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.410
Is that where you met her?

24:24.421 --> 24:27.003
Reddick brought her in.

24:27.049 --> 24:30.416
And I tried to help her.

24:30.427 --> 24:34.261
Then one day
she doesn't show up.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.719
You know?
And I go looking for her.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.724
Now I'm missing
my kid's softball game,

24:39.770 --> 24:41.226
for Christ's sake.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.933
And this little crackhead
could give a damn.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.648
Then I find her
on the street...

24:46.694 --> 24:48.980
high.

24:49.029 --> 24:52.487
Turning tricks.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.649
So...

24:57.871 --> 25:01.159
So I make her get in my car.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.789
You know?

25:02.835 --> 25:06.123
She spits at me.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.127
So I hit her.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.550
I mean, it was almost a reflex.

25:10.592 --> 25:15.052
And...
she's bleeding now.

25:15.097 --> 25:16.303
And she's looking at me...

25:16.348 --> 25:21.433
with that face...
with those eyes.

25:21.437 --> 25:25.100
And, uh, now I know
that she's gonna tell.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.605
She's gonna bring me down,

25:26.650 --> 25:30.268
destroy everything--
everything that I worked for.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.938
So, I take her out
to the woods,

25:33.991 --> 25:36.323
and...

25:38.579 --> 25:40.695
I don't remember much
after that.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.461
It was quiet.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.459
What?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.335
Afterwards.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.217
I mean, she didn't cry,
she didn't scream,

25:59.224 --> 26:00.725
she didn't...

26:00.726 --> 26:02.887
She...

26:04.563 --> 26:07.396
She just...

26:07.441 --> 26:10.979
She just looked at me.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.230
You know, their eyes...

26:16.241 --> 26:20.405
when they know
that it's the end,

26:20.412 --> 26:25.247
they look at you like...

26:25.250 --> 26:26.865
like no one else.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.034
Stop it.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.204
When you go past the pain,

26:31.215 --> 26:34.378
you pass the animal terror...

26:43.102 --> 26:45.889
there's nothing else--

26:45.938 --> 26:47.929
nothing else in the world
like it.

26:53.237 --> 26:57.025
But you're a father.
You're--

26:57.074 --> 26:59.190
You have Bethany.
You adore her.

26:59.243 --> 27:00.699
She's no different than...

27:00.744 --> 27:02.780
than these girls
that you killed.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.617
They're just junkies, whores.

27:05.624 --> 27:09.082
They're just a burden
to their families.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.417
I mean, they're everywhere.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.455
They're under bridges,

27:11.547 --> 27:15.131
they're just walking alone
at night.

27:15.175 --> 27:19.464
They're in cheap,
amateur porn video.

27:19.555 --> 27:23.389
And nobody sees them.
Because nobody cares.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.100
Just”.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.603
human garbage.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.604
So you just killed them?

27:31.608 --> 27:34.691
I saved them
from the inevitability

27:34.736 --> 27:36.112
of their lives.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.281
You're a monster.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.614
Maybe.

27:50.961 --> 27:52.622
Maybe.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.180
I don't know
if this is anything,

28:02.222 --> 28:03.678
but I'm at
the foster mom's house.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.297
I found something
in the kid's backpack.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.305
What?

28:06.351 --> 28:07.966
Something he wrote for school.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.636
"I don't want to be alone.
That's what scares me.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.102
If my dad does die,
I want to be with my mom."

28:14.151 --> 28:15.641
His mom's dead.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.062
I know.

28:17.112 --> 28:20.149
You don't think the kid would
try and off himself, do you?

28:22.034 --> 28:24.696
Nah, he's a kid.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.659
He-- he probably meant
his foster mom.

28:26.705 --> 28:31.449
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Just grasping at straws.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.455
Okay. Let me check something
out. I'll get back to you.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.715
You went
to kill Adrian that night.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.057
Trisha Seward
just got in the way.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.553
No, no, no.
I never meant to kill him.

28:52.606 --> 28:55.018
No, the tree house was far
from the water.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.557
I wasn't sure how much he saw,

28:56.610 --> 28:58.851
so Ijust wanted to talk
to him, see what he knew.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.019
That's all.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.562
You went to his apartment
at 1:00 in the morning.

29:01.573 --> 29:05.236
To talk to him?
Quit lying to me.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.485
You went there to kill him.

29:07.537 --> 29:08.993
No, ifI wanted to kill him

29:09.039 --> 29:11.826
I could have a dozen times.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.082
But he didn't remember me.

29:17.047 --> 29:22.542
I mean, that's when I knew
that I was... I was free.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.679
Until you kidnapped him.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.837
Why did you take him
to this place?

29:26.890 --> 29:29.381
'Cause of you.

29:29.434 --> 29:30.890
You said
he was starting to remember.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.892
You were helping him remember.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.271
So, you left me no choice,
Sarah.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.604
Did you kill him?

29:39.653 --> 29:43.111
Well, you know, I should have.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.613
I'd be long gone by now.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.575
I couldn't do it.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.124
I don't kill children.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.747
They're all children!

29:54.793 --> 29:56.408
No. There's a difference
between 6 and 16.

29:56.461 --> 30:00.249
They were
12-year-old girls!

30:00.299 --> 30:02.381
How do you do that?!

30:04.011 --> 30:06.673
I don't need excuses.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.726
What about you?
What's your excuse?

30:14.771 --> 30:15.886
Why are you here?

30:15.939 --> 30:17.600
Hmm?
Are you here for Adrian,

30:17.649 --> 30:19.765
or is it because
you need to understand

30:19.818 --> 30:21.103
how you could have made love
to me just a few hours ago?

30:21.111 --> 30:22.601
Don't do that.

30:22.612 --> 30:23.772
It meant something, Sarah.

30:23.822 --> 30:27.280
Admit it.
You loved me, Sarah.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.611
Because I didn't know you.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.777
No. But a part of you did.
Part of you did.

30:31.830 --> 30:32.990
What are you talking about?

30:32.998 --> 30:35.489
No, you knew something.
You knew something.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.957
I mean, that's why you ended up
in the hospital.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.542
But you still loved me.

30:39.588 --> 30:42.079
- Oh, you-- you bastard! You son
of a bitch! - Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

30:42.132 --> 30:44.088
Don't you make this about me!

30:44.134 --> 30:45.624
You're gonna kill us both.
Sarah, stop!

30:45.635 --> 30:46.795
- What are you gonna do?!
- Stop! Stop!

30:46.845 --> 30:48.301
Stop! Stop!

30:48.347 --> 30:50.429
- Hit me?! Cut my throat?!
Is that what happens?! - Stop it!

31:22.172 --> 31:24.834
Don't touch me!

31:24.841 --> 31:26.172
Don't touch me!
Just get away from me!

31:26.176 --> 31:27.291
Just get back in the car!

31:27.344 --> 31:30.962
Get back in the car.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.880
Where is he?

32:09.302 --> 32:11.793
Not far.

33:37.057 --> 33:39.844
What is this place?

33:39.893 --> 33:41.884
The lake house.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.815
I wish you would have seen it
in the daylight.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.818
The water's beautiful.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.854
Cold and deep.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.576
Is this where you put Kallie?

34:04.668 --> 34:06.283
Kallie Leeds.

34:06.336 --> 34:08.543
The missing girl
with the red hair.

34:10.090 --> 34:12.251
You don't remember her?

34:15.095 --> 34:17.632
You gave her ring
to your daughter.

34:19.933 --> 34:23.050
She had blue eyes...

34:23.103 --> 34:25.765
and these little star earrings.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.698
Are there more girls
in the lake?

34:47.168 --> 34:50.331
And other places.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.712
No one will ever find them.

34:56.553 --> 34:58.669
It's the
loneliest thing in the world,

34:58.722 --> 35:00.553
waiting to be found.

35:24.080 --> 35:28.870
It's exhausting to hide,
to pretend.

35:28.877 --> 35:31.744
I don't have to
pretend anymore.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.421
Not with you.

35:40.513 --> 35:44.677
And it was working out so well.

35:44.726 --> 35:49.516
That Joe Mills,
that waste of life.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.852
I planted those rings.
I put that girl in the trunk.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.187
Perfect.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.397
Her name was Bullet.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.406
Yeah.

36:02.452 --> 36:05.410
She called headquarters.

36:05.455 --> 36:08.322
She thought
she was being clever,

36:08.375 --> 36:10.616
leaving a message for Holder.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.001
"I know who it is."

36:16.549 --> 36:18.710
So I had to go to her.

36:20.345 --> 36:23.303
You understand?

36:23.348 --> 36:26.340
I should have seen.

36:26.393 --> 36:29.556
You didn't see
because you didn't want to see.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.308
Where is Adrian?

36:35.235 --> 36:37.396
Get out of the car.

37:44.846 --> 37:47.883
Adrian!

37:47.932 --> 37:49.047
Adﬂan?

38:01.362 --> 38:04.024
Where is he?

38:09.329 --> 38:11.991
Where's Adrian?

38:11.998 --> 38:14.489
He's been with us
the whole time.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.952
He's in the trunk.

38:22.008 --> 38:24.169
Give me the keys!

38:27.514 --> 38:30.722
Give me those keys.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.209
Adﬂan?

39:03.216 --> 39:05.377
You okay?

39:05.385 --> 39:06.875
Yeah.

39:06.886 --> 39:09.423
I'm a police officer.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.596
It's gonna be okay.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.217
Holder.

39:15.270 --> 39:17.886
Give me the keys.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.554
You know, those girls...

39:19.566 --> 39:21.898
they weren't that innocent,
Sarah.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.859
You should have seen
what they did with me.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.189
Shut up!

39:26.239 --> 39:28.855
Shut your filthy mouth,
you son of a bitch.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.114
Give me those keys.

39:35.748 --> 39:37.488
I lied.

39:37.584 --> 39:40.451
If there is one thing
I regret...

39:42.881 --> 39:44.917
it's killing that boy.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.255
No.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.838
Killing Adrian off, 'cause
I don't-- I don't do that.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.673
I don't kill little children.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.565
Linden!

40:06.404 --> 40:08.315
Linden!

40:12.952 --> 40:15.113
You okay, Linden?

40:15.163 --> 40:17.779
Aah.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.628
You okay?

40:24.923 --> 40:26.709
We got him.
Adrian-- he's alive.

40:26.758 --> 40:31.218
Reddick found him.
He's with him right now.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.256
Adrian's alive.

40:36.309 --> 40:37.890
He's fine.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.551
Put the gun down.

40:39.562 --> 40:43.271
Linden. Linden.
Look at me.

40:43.316 --> 40:47.059
He wants you to do this.
Put the gun down.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.317
Put the gun down, Linden.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.487
Look at me, Sarah.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.694
Look at me.

40:57.747 --> 41:01.456
It's got to be you.
You loved me.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.158
- You loved me. You-- you love me.
- Linden.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.578
- It's over.
- Look at me.

41:06.631 --> 41:09.088
Oh, no!

41:27.068 --> 41:28.683
No.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.897
No, no, no.
