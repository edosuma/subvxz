01:24.931 --> 01:27.968
<i>Hello, gang. This is Midge.</i>

01:28.001 --> 01:32.638
<i>Sending you my warmest
and fondest wishes tonight</i>

01:32.671 --> 01:35.474
<i>out to the American
expeditionary forces.</i>

01:36.642 --> 01:38.310
<i>You will soon be welcomed</i>

01:38.344 --> 01:40.412
<i>by a sizable
German greeting party.</i>

01:41.715 --> 01:44.084
<i>There's a lot of them, boys.</i>

01:44.117 --> 01:46.720
<i>What chance do you have?</i>

01:46.753 --> 01:49.991
<i>It's not too late to surrender.</i>

01:50.024 --> 01:53.060
<i>There's no reason
for we Americans</i>

01:53.094 --> 01:56.831
<i>to get mixed up in this mess.</i>

01:56.864 --> 01:59.867
<i>I don't want to see
your lives wasted</i>

01:59.901 --> 02:02.636
<i>in fighting with
the unbeatable German Army.</i>

02:03.905 --> 02:08.575
<i>I'm only saying these things
because I care about you.</i>

02:08.608 --> 02:11.444
<i>In reality, there's no war
between Germany and America.</i>

02:12.848 --> 02:15.383
<i>Do yourself a favor</i>

02:15.416 --> 02:18.352
<i>and be my special guest
in Germany.</i>

04:08.801 --> 04:11.237
<i>This is the captain speaking.</i>

04:11.270 --> 04:13.707
<i>We'll be landing at
Washington National Airport</i>

04:13.740 --> 04:15.008
<i>in about ten minutes.</i>

04:36.563 --> 04:38.465
Hey, stranger.

04:40.567 --> 04:42.704
How can I be a stranger
when I saw you last night?

04:44.671 --> 04:46.506
Doesn't matter.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.675
<i>Bourbon, bitte.</i>

04:48.710 --> 04:50.078
Doesn't matter?

04:51.079 --> 04:52.947
I'm risking my life to see you.

04:55.049 --> 04:57.684
I appreciate
you seeking me out.

04:57.719 --> 04:59.888
But, I'm not sure
I want the job.

04:59.922 --> 05:01.056
It's a perfect fit.

05:02.157 --> 05:04.093
Picture this.

05:04.126 --> 05:06.061
After the war.

05:06.095 --> 05:08.629
Your name would be
in newspapers.

05:08.663 --> 05:10.733
Bright lights on Broadway.

05:10.766 --> 05:12.167
You'll be the talk of town.

05:14.669 --> 05:16.138
I think you're a star.

05:16.171 --> 05:18.173
Max.

05:19.775 --> 05:20.943
You're in love with me.

05:22.177 --> 05:23.245
Nothing has changed.

05:34.157 --> 05:36.826
Ah! She's here.

05:40.596 --> 05:42.165
You set me up.

05:42.198 --> 05:45.101
Hmm-mm.
Meet your new band.

05:45.135 --> 05:46.770
Charlie and his orchestra.

05:48.706 --> 05:49.974
Okay, I'll do it.

05:55.645 --> 05:57.281
Let's give her a hand.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.655
"Won't You?" from the top.
Thanks.

06:51.437 --> 06:53.306
What is your biggest weakness?

06:56.342 --> 06:58.711
Being an American?

07:01.448 --> 07:05.886
Born Mildred Elizabeth Sisk
in Portland, Maine.

07:05.919 --> 07:07.287
Your mother remarried.

07:07.321 --> 07:10.924
You took the surname Gillars.

07:10.958 --> 07:14.161
In 1911, at 16,
you moved to Conneaut, Ohio.

07:14.194 --> 07:19.299
1918, you enrolled
at Ohio Wesleyan University

07:19.333 --> 07:21.735
to study dramatic arts.

07:21.768 --> 07:23.872
Then I moved
to New York City

07:23.905 --> 07:26.774
and toured with stock companies
and vaudeville.

07:29.043 --> 07:32.280
1929, you moved to France

07:32.313 --> 07:34.182
and lived in Paris.

07:34.215 --> 07:38.685
In 1934, you moved to Dresden
to study music

07:38.720 --> 07:42.390
and was enrolled
as a teacher of English

07:42.423 --> 07:46.227
at the Berlitz School
of Languages in Berlin.

07:46.261 --> 07:47.463
Is this correct?

07:47.496 --> 07:48.931
It is correct, yes.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.202
Why should we hire you?

07:54.170 --> 07:55.938
Because I am the best.

08:01.810 --> 08:03.145
Max Otto Koischwitz,

08:03.179 --> 08:05.347
the program director
of the USA Zone,

08:05.381 --> 08:07.750
wants you on his new show.

08:07.783 --> 08:08.884
Hmm.

08:14.124 --> 08:15.792
I want you
to understand something.

08:18.061 --> 08:22.766
The spoken word is the most
powerful weapon in the world.

08:22.799 --> 08:25.769
With the right words,
a war can be won

08:25.802 --> 08:28.038
before the first rifle
is loaded.

08:28.071 --> 08:32.442
We're here to attract people,
to win them over.

08:32.475 --> 08:34.978
That is "propaganda".

08:35.011 --> 08:39.150
And it works best
when those being manipulated

08:39.183 --> 08:43.087
are confident they're acting
on their own free will.

08:45.356 --> 08:47.091
Are we clear?

08:47.124 --> 08:48.859
Yes. Quite clear.

08:51.162 --> 08:53.331
This is Berlin calling.

08:53.364 --> 08:57.201
Berlin calling the American
mothers and wives.

08:57.235 --> 09:01.039
And when Berlin calls,
it pays to listen in

09:01.073 --> 09:04.376
because there's an American girl
sitting at the microphone

09:04.409 --> 09:06.845
every Tuesday evening

09:06.878 --> 09:11.516
with a few words of truth
to her countrywomen back home.

09:11.550 --> 09:16.121
Now, boys, you know there's
nothing in the world

09:16.154 --> 09:20.259
any sweeter
than the sounds of home.

09:20.292 --> 09:23.195
Is someone missing you tonight?

09:23.228 --> 09:25.131
Is her name Linda?

09:25.164 --> 09:28.568
Sandy? Karen?

09:28.601 --> 09:30.803
Do those thoughts
bring back memories

09:30.837 --> 09:36.342
of the sultry summer nights
dancing so close together?

09:36.376 --> 09:39.279
So close
you can hardly breathe...

09:51.025 --> 09:52.459
and hearing your girlfriend's

09:52.493 --> 09:54.395
- soft laughter.
- <i>Gut.</i>

09:54.428 --> 09:58.098
Sadly, boys,
tomorrow you're once again

09:58.132 --> 10:01.468
going out against
superior German forces.

10:01.502 --> 10:04.071
What chance do you have?

10:04.104 --> 10:06.140
It's not too late to surrender.

10:11.513 --> 10:14.115
Dance with our lovely <i>frauleins</i>

10:14.683 --> 10:16.951
Nice, virile,

10:16.985 --> 10:20.855
and muscular
American men like you.

10:22.624 --> 10:24.893
And now for some music.

10:25.894 --> 10:27.429
She's perfect.

10:37.139 --> 10:38.574
<i>Naturlich.</i>

11:51.417 --> 11:53.652
<i>Get a quick conviction
on Axis Sally.</i>

11:53.685 --> 11:55.187
<i>The case is yours.</i>

11:55.220 --> 11:56.622
Listen, it's a grounder.

11:56.655 --> 11:59.158
There's no question about it.
Easy out.

11:59.191 --> 12:00.559
We've confidence in you,
Mr. Laughlin.

12:00.592 --> 12:01.994
Oh, thanks.

12:02.027 --> 12:03.061
Thank you for your time.

12:03.095 --> 12:04.163
Thank you.

12:06.432 --> 12:07.599
Hi, honey.

12:07.633 --> 12:09.301
- Look who's here.
- Hi.

12:09.334 --> 12:10.569
Got a death threat in the mail.

12:12.071 --> 12:16.342
Oh yeah.
I thought they were past that.

12:16.376 --> 12:18.478
Well, the public
has a hard time forgetting

12:18.511 --> 12:20.180
when you defend communists.

12:21.314 --> 12:24.150
No contest.
I can't read these things.

12:24.184 --> 12:25.452
- I'll read it.
- Tommy's not here.

12:25.485 --> 12:27.086
What's up?

12:27.120 --> 12:29.589
I assumed he was with you.
He didn't call.

12:29.622 --> 12:32.358
Well, he-he-he didn't call?

12:32.392 --> 12:34.728
He hasn't missed a day
in four years, this kid.

12:34.762 --> 12:37.498
He's only been here
four days in four years.

12:37.531 --> 12:41.368
Objection. Hyperbole.

12:41.402 --> 12:43.772
Your 4:00 p.m. canceled.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.207
- Oh, good.
- Yes.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.241
How did it go today?

12:49.376 --> 12:53.414
Axis Sally heard
I was a judge killer.

12:53.447 --> 12:56.450
She's not wrong.
You are.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.119
Okay.
Do you know that judge died

12:59.154 --> 13:01.757
in his own chambers on a recess?

13:01.791 --> 13:04.059
He had
a coronary artery disease,

13:04.092 --> 13:05.560
and he dropped dead.

13:05.594 --> 13:06.762
I didn't kill him.

13:06.796 --> 13:08.798
He loved me.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.565
He loved my shenanigans
in court.

13:10.599 --> 13:12.234
He said I was his court jester.

13:14.469 --> 13:18.406
If I knew I had
the skillset to kill judges,

13:18.440 --> 13:20.642
I woulda had
a baker's dozen by now.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.179
Okay. Can you at least wait
until I pass the bar?

13:23.212 --> 13:24.580
You're gonna need a good lawyer.

13:30.754 --> 13:33.456
Yeah, I'll-I'll
take it from here, alright?

13:33.489 --> 13:34.657
Thank you.

13:39.395 --> 13:41.664
So, are you finished
signing autographs today?

13:43.699 --> 13:45.635
I'm never finished.

13:45.668 --> 13:46.737
Oh.

13:46.770 --> 13:48.740
It's my job.

13:48.773 --> 13:51.776
Well, it's my job
to represent you.

13:52.810 --> 13:54.177
James Laughlin.

13:58.649 --> 14:00.150
- I see.
- Thank you.

14:00.183 --> 14:01.719
So I do have some rights.

14:03.554 --> 14:07.257
Well, I think you do.
You should.

14:07.291 --> 14:12.330
But you're up on eight counts.
Eight counts of treason.

14:12.363 --> 14:15.266
And the prosecution's
looking to hang you.

14:17.803 --> 14:21.807
I was at the hearing.
I'm aware of the charges.

14:23.541 --> 14:26.644
Oh, well, that's good.
Here you go.

14:26.678 --> 14:32.317
This is a contract
that says you're aware.

14:33.551 --> 14:35.554
You've been informed
of what's goin' on.

14:39.358 --> 14:40.794
So what's the plan of attack?

14:47.266 --> 14:49.368
Excuse me? What?

14:49.401 --> 14:50.703
Plan of attack?

14:50.737 --> 14:51.805
I'm sorry.

14:51.838 --> 14:53.539
I-I don't know
what you're saying.

14:53.572 --> 14:56.342
This is the part
where you tell me

14:56.375 --> 14:57.811
that you've got it
all worked out

14:57.844 --> 14:59.679
and I have nothing
to worry about.

14:59.713 --> 15:01.181
Yeah.

15:01.214 --> 15:04.317
That's why you're getting paid
all this money.

15:04.351 --> 15:06.686
Oh, well, I'm not being paid
by you, Miss Gillars.

15:08.823 --> 15:11.424
Well, somebody is.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.794
You don't strike me
as a man who does charity.

15:15.495 --> 15:19.666
In fact, I would bet
you're bought and sold

15:19.699 --> 15:21.134
to the highest bidder.

15:23.739 --> 15:26.775
That hurts even more.
Thank you for that.

15:26.808 --> 15:28.476
Why don't you
finish signing that?

15:28.509 --> 15:29.878
Read it, sign it.

15:29.911 --> 15:33.147
And I'll be back when
you're somehow better framed.

15:34.515 --> 15:38.219
It's your job
to prove I'm innocent.

15:38.252 --> 15:41.823
Miss Gillars, you are,
right now, at this very moment,

15:41.857 --> 15:45.159
the most hated person
in America.

15:46.762 --> 15:50.800
On a par perhaps
with Hitler himself.

15:50.833 --> 15:54.670
The only difference
between you and Hitler,

15:54.703 --> 15:58.573
as the public sees it,
is that you're still breathing.

16:00.475 --> 16:01.710
I will be your lawyer.

16:01.744 --> 16:03.712
I will see
that you get a fair trial.

16:05.280 --> 16:09.752
Nothing more, nothing less.
You got me. Alright?

16:14.024 --> 16:16.392
I want another lawyer.

16:16.426 --> 16:18.227
New lawyer?

16:18.261 --> 16:19.763
Nobody
wants to be your lawyer.

16:20.964 --> 16:22.933
You understand that?

16:22.966 --> 16:25.702
I'm your lawyer.
Nobody wanted the case.

16:25.736 --> 16:26.937
And you did?

16:29.605 --> 16:30.841
I was asked.

16:30.874 --> 16:31.909
Not by me.

16:31.942 --> 16:34.878
Oh no, not by you, no.

16:34.912 --> 16:38.649
But beggars can't be choosers.
Can they?

16:38.682 --> 16:40.217
This is not fair.

16:41.820 --> 16:44.421
If you live,
it'll be fair.

16:46.356 --> 16:48.592
Sign that paper,
and I will talk to you soon.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.427
Can I get out of here, please?

16:51.830 --> 16:53.297
Hello, Larry.

16:53.330 --> 16:54.565
Pretty tough case,
Mr. Laughlin.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.366
- Any comments?
- Oh, it's tough. It's tough.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.701
That's why I'm here.

16:57.736 --> 16:59.839
Otherwise, you'd be
talking to Mr. Myers, right?

16:59.872 --> 17:01.406
- Well.
- Yeah.

17:01.439 --> 17:03.308
Oh, and sir, is it true
Miss Gillars shot and killed

17:03.341 --> 17:05.978
- three American soldiers?
- Oh, come on, Larry.

17:06.011 --> 17:08.613
This is a case about words,
not bullets.

17:08.646 --> 17:11.884
Excuse me. Mr. Laughlin!

17:11.917 --> 17:13.284
Hey, I'm sorry,
I don't...

17:13.318 --> 17:14.987
I don't have any spare change.
I don't...

17:15.020 --> 17:16.088
- I don't carry any around.
- Can you...

17:16.122 --> 17:17.823
can you spare a minute
of your time, Mr. Laughlin?

17:19.357 --> 17:20.860
Alright. That's really
a lot more expensive,

17:20.893 --> 17:21.927
but go ahead. Shoot.

17:21.961 --> 17:23.395
Tommy's in the slammer.

17:25.932 --> 17:26.967
Is this real?

17:28.434 --> 17:30.036
- What'd he do?
- Assault and battery.

17:30.070 --> 17:32.705
Messed the guy up pretty bad.
He's gonna do time.

17:32.739 --> 17:34.775
Hot damn.

17:34.808 --> 17:36.943
Now, he had a problem
with the giggle water.

17:36.977 --> 17:38.078
Now how do you know this?

17:38.111 --> 17:39.645
I-I used to work
for Jerry Matthews,

17:39.678 --> 17:42.048
county court public defender.

17:42.082 --> 17:43.850
What do you mean, used to?
What does that mean?

17:43.884 --> 17:45.819
Well, you've got
an open seat at your table

17:45.852 --> 17:48.890
and I-I wanna take
Tommy's place.

17:50.590 --> 17:52.026
Where did you serve?

17:52.059 --> 17:53.995
Almost died of dengue fever
in the South Pacific,

17:54.028 --> 17:56.563
but I got this
when I fractured my ankle

17:56.596 --> 17:58.632
jumping down a 12-foot perch
at Key's Theater

17:58.665 --> 18:01.803
after watching Truman's
inauguration parade.

18:01.836 --> 18:03.871
Well, that's a tough break.

18:03.905 --> 18:04.972
Tough break. That's funny.

18:05.006 --> 18:06.606
You-you-you got
some real wit, sir.

18:08.408 --> 18:11.445
Now, that wasn't a pun.
Drop the ass-kissing.

18:11.479 --> 18:13.115
Tommy was very good
at what he did.

18:13.148 --> 18:14.715
So those are big shoes to fill.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.651
Can you do it?
What do you got?

18:16.684 --> 18:19.788
Well sir, I was the reason
Tommy passed the bar.

18:19.822 --> 18:21.924
I was the top of my class
at George Washington University

18:21.957 --> 18:23.859
and the top
of my officer training class

18:23.892 --> 18:25.994
in the Marine Corps.

18:26.028 --> 18:27.461
I wanna learn from the best.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.833
Well, I'm not looking
for a student.

18:30.866 --> 18:32.835
This isn't county court, kid.

18:32.868 --> 18:36.638
I don't represent hookers.
I don't represent thieves.

18:36.672 --> 18:38.808
What I do affects
the whole country.

18:40.810 --> 18:43.378
I-I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

18:43.412 --> 18:45.048
Can you sit next to a woman

18:45.081 --> 18:47.083
for the final two months
of her life,

18:47.116 --> 18:50.954
knowing that you'll probably be
the last person she sees

18:50.987 --> 18:53.790
before she's hanged?
You do that?

18:56.025 --> 18:57.861
Uh. yes.

19:02.032 --> 19:03.566
You got an hour.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.936
Uh, you got clothes at home?

19:05.970 --> 19:07.171
- No, sir.
- I didn't think so.

19:07.204 --> 19:08.939
You're gonna need a suit.

19:08.973 --> 19:10.540
And you're gonna need shoes

19:10.573 --> 19:13.043
that look like
you don't walk to work.

19:13.077 --> 19:15.012
So, this is for you.

19:15.045 --> 19:17.547
Now if you're not back
before they swear in the jury,

19:17.580 --> 19:19.016
you lost your seat at the table.

19:19.049 --> 19:20.617
You don't have a job.

19:20.650 --> 19:22.619
You will have a suit.
You will have a pair of shoes.

19:22.652 --> 19:23.889
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

19:23.922 --> 19:25.123
You'll owe me for them.

19:25.156 --> 19:26.724
I won't disappoint you.
Thank you.

19:26.758 --> 19:27.792
I'll be back in an hour.

19:27.826 --> 19:29.027
Well, that's nice to hear.

wish you good luck.

That's cliche of you,

21:22.577 --> 21:24.214
James, I want you
to look at me.

21:24.247 --> 21:26.182
Oh, your eyes
are still green.

21:26.216 --> 21:28.084
Ah, you always did
love that about me.

21:28.118 --> 21:29.618
I did.

21:29.651 --> 21:32.022
I work for the district
attorney's office now.

21:32.055 --> 21:34.190
Oh! You're lying.

21:34.224 --> 21:36.860
For God's sake,
fix your tie.

21:36.893 --> 21:39.329
Well, you're still bitter,
I can see that.

21:39.362 --> 21:40.629
My tie.

21:43.066 --> 21:44.200
Fastidious.

21:46.036 --> 21:47.038
Bitch.

21:52.176 --> 21:53.610
Here we are.

22:31.316 --> 22:32.818
All rise.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.790
Federal District Court
is now in session.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.662
The Honorable Judge
Edward M. Curran presiding.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.138
This is a matter
of United States versus Gillars.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.109
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

22:56.142 --> 22:59.712
your duty here today and
over the course of this trial

22:59.746 --> 23:03.683
is to determine if the defendant
is guilty of treason or not,

23:03.716 --> 23:07.788
based solely on the evidence
and facts provided here.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.756
We start today
with opening arguments.

23:09.790 --> 23:10.858
Is the prosecution ready?

23:10.891 --> 23:12.059
Yes, Your Honor.

23:12.092 --> 23:13.127
You may proceed.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.329
Thank you, Your Honor.

23:15.362 --> 23:18.098
Is there a greater crime
that a human being can commit

23:18.132 --> 23:19.766
than treason?

23:19.800 --> 23:23.171
As it is not a crime
against just one man,

23:23.204 --> 23:25.039
but a crime against
every man of this great nation?

23:25.073 --> 23:28.709
Therefore, it must be treated
with the utmost severity.

23:32.713 --> 23:34.681
Axis Sally.

23:34.715 --> 23:36.251
She went by other names too.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.052
"The Berlin Babe."

23:38.086 --> 23:39.954
"Hitler's girlfriend."

23:41.489 --> 23:44.292
We've all heard her broadcasts.

23:44.325 --> 23:47.329
Her relentless treasonous praise
of the German military,

23:47.363 --> 23:48.397
of Hitler himself.

23:48.430 --> 23:50.799
She was the voice of a man

23:50.833 --> 23:53.735
who claimed the lives
of over 400,000 American men.

23:57.072 --> 24:00.075
Now I can't stand here
before you and even predict

24:00.109 --> 24:01.210
what the defense
is going to argue,

24:01.243 --> 24:03.379
or if they even choose to
present an argument at all.

24:07.416 --> 24:11.288
But what I can do,
and what I will do,

24:11.321 --> 24:14.024
is prove to you
beyond a reasonable doubt

24:14.057 --> 24:18.328
that Mildred Gillars
is a traitor to our country.

24:18.361 --> 24:21.932
For years, Mildred Gillars
voluntarily utilized

24:21.965 --> 24:23.333
a German propaganda machine

24:23.366 --> 24:25.135
to weaken
the American war effort,

24:25.168 --> 24:27.470
and to destroy
the morale of our troops.

24:30.173 --> 24:33.009
Now if that does not personify

24:33.043 --> 24:35.346
the very definition
of the word 'treason',

24:39.250 --> 24:40.717
I don't know what does.

24:42.820 --> 24:43.821
Thank you, Mr. Kelley.

24:44.922 --> 24:45.923
Mr. Laughlin?

24:47.558 --> 24:49.160
Yes, Your Honor?

24:49.193 --> 24:51.362
Opening statement,
Mr. Laughlin.

24:51.395 --> 24:53.931
Oh, yes. Billy.

24:55.299 --> 24:56.801
- Want you to read that.
- Sir?

24:56.834 --> 24:58.436
Yeah. Just stand up.

24:58.470 --> 24:59.905
Read.

25:03.175 --> 25:06.011
The defense feels
that the charges

25:06.044 --> 25:09.915
as well as the comments we just
heard from Prosecutor Kelley

25:09.948 --> 25:14.486
holds less water than a.
a midget's thimble.

25:14.519 --> 25:16.221
And therefore, Your Honor,

25:16.255 --> 25:19.224
the defense has no comment
at this time.

25:22.862 --> 25:23.930
Thank you, Your Honor.

25:31.571 --> 25:34.540
You didn't come into this world
naturally, did you, Billy?

25:34.574 --> 25:37.043
They had to tear you
out of your mother. Hmm.

25:38.511 --> 25:40.346
Huh?

25:48.155 --> 25:49.256
Billy.

25:50.891 --> 25:54.862
Now, I'm-I'm gonna act like
I'm talking serious as hell.

25:54.895 --> 25:57.331
And you listen
like I'm telling you

25:57.364 --> 26:01.135
the secret password to the best
whorehouse in town. Got it?

26:01.168 --> 26:03.103
Now, this... this may be

26:03.137 --> 26:06.273
the most important part
of the whole thing.

26:06.307 --> 26:09.076
Because no matter
what happens in here,

26:09.109 --> 26:11.212
no matter what those monkeys
across the aisle

26:11.246 --> 26:13.248
say or do or think,

26:13.281 --> 26:17.152
the very most important thing
is that we behave

26:17.185 --> 26:20.088
as if we just won the war
all over again.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.356
You understand?

26:21.389 --> 26:26.528
Confidence is everything.
Everything.

26:26.561 --> 26:30.332
Absolutely everything
in this room.

26:30.365 --> 26:31.900
Don't you ever forget that.

26:31.933 --> 26:34.002
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

26:34.035 --> 26:36.005
Told you not to speak,
didn't I, Billy?

26:36.038 --> 26:38.107
Don't talk.
Just listen. Okay.

26:41.110 --> 26:43.045
Don't you ever in your life

26:43.079 --> 26:46.082
repeat what I'm about to
say to you now.

26:46.115 --> 26:48.951
Because I thought about this
a great deal last night.

26:51.687 --> 26:55.591
I cannot stand
that damn Gillars broad.

26:55.624 --> 26:57.660
Did you see the way
she walked in today?

26:57.693 --> 27:00.197
Like she was
Bette Davis or something?

27:00.230 --> 27:02.899
I don't want
anything to do with her

27:02.933 --> 27:04.134
for the rest of the trial.

27:05.602 --> 27:08.004
I'll sit here beside her,
I'll do what I do

27:08.038 --> 27:11.641
because it's
incredible publicity.

27:11.675 --> 27:14.244
Win or lose, though,
makes no difference to me.

27:14.277 --> 27:15.312
That's the point...

27:15.345 --> 27:16.913
A few words, Mr. Laughlin.

27:16.947 --> 27:18.648
- Huh?
- A few words, please?

27:18.682 --> 27:20.350
A few words?

27:20.384 --> 27:23.988
Ingrid, for you,
I got more than a few, honey.

27:24.021 --> 27:25.323
- Hmm.
- I'll be right there, guys.

27:25.356 --> 27:26.357
I'm comin'.

27:27.625 --> 27:31.662
Now, from now on,
after every dismissal,

27:31.696 --> 27:35.133
you go down to her holding cell,
relay anything I give you.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.069
You do the same every morning.

27:38.102 --> 27:40.538
Before she comes up here,
you relay what I've said.

27:40.571 --> 27:43.541
Okay? Same thing
every single day.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.376
Keep good notes,

27:45.410 --> 27:48.447
and tell me anything
you think is important.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.249
Am I making myself
crystal clear?

27:51.450 --> 27:52.518
Look at that!

27:52.551 --> 27:54.620
Confidence catching on.

27:56.188 --> 27:57.556
Don't let it go to your head.

27:58.991 --> 28:01.059
We shall see
what we shall see.

28:02.261 --> 28:06.398
Yes, I am here at last.
I am here.

28:06.432 --> 28:08.567
It was worth... well worth
the wait, I'm sorry.

28:26.286 --> 28:28.188
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

28:28.221 --> 28:30.089
<i>I'm speaking to you tonight</i>

28:30.123 --> 28:32.760
<i>at a very serious moment
in our history.</i>

28:32.793 --> 28:34.462
<i>For months now,
the knowledge</i>

28:34.495 --> 28:36.765
<i>that something of this kind
might happen,</i>

28:36.798 --> 28:38.767
<i>has been hanging
over our heads.</i>

28:38.800 --> 28:40.701
<i>That is all over now,</i>

28:40.734 --> 28:42.536
<i>and there is no more
uncertainty.</i>

28:44.271 --> 28:46.474
<i>In the meantime,
we, the people,</i>

28:46.507 --> 28:49.043
<i>are already prepared
for action.</i>

28:56.450 --> 28:59.287
How could they do this, Max?

28:59.321 --> 29:03.191
America's neutral.
Why would your ally attack us?

29:03.225 --> 29:05.393
Our ally.

29:05.427 --> 29:08.230
No, this is not
what I signed up for.

29:08.263 --> 29:10.465
Mildred, please be careful
with your words.

29:20.642 --> 29:22.077
Max.

29:46.537 --> 29:49.406
Did you know,
after the last war,

29:51.776 --> 29:54.812
Americans bought the ruins
of German castles

29:54.846 --> 29:57.381
and moved them,
stone by stone, to the USA?

29:59.383 --> 30:01.685
They thought they could
purchase our national history.

30:04.388 --> 30:08.525
They were naive enough to think
that Europe respected the wealth

30:08.559 --> 30:11.596
that enabled them to buy
what their culture lacked.

30:13.665 --> 30:15.133
Did you know that?

30:16.701 --> 30:17.702
No.

30:24.877 --> 30:27.145
America is young.

30:27.178 --> 30:30.448
And we can forgive
the mistakes of youth,

30:30.481 --> 30:33.718
but their arrogance
is unacceptable.

30:33.751 --> 30:38.657
They disrespect our
thousands of years of history,

30:39.325 --> 30:41.560
and preach to us of morality.

30:44.530 --> 30:47.199
They have the ability
to distinguish

30:47.232 --> 30:49.201
truth from falsehood.

30:49.234 --> 30:50.569
Gold from floss.

30:54.373 --> 30:56.776
Only difference today
in the America you left

30:56.810 --> 30:59.112
is that it has decayed
even further.

31:01.514 --> 31:07.487
Their capitalism has produced
a handful of wealthy men,

31:07.520 --> 31:09.890
and a nation of slaves
who think they are free.

31:11.759 --> 31:15.495
Their Hollywood films glamorize
the lifestyle of the upper few,

31:15.528 --> 31:18.198
while the rest of the country
keeps fantasizing

31:18.231 --> 31:19.699
that one day,
this could be them.

31:21.769 --> 31:24.205
They're too unintelligent
to realize

31:24.238 --> 31:27.241
that the few pennies
they are paid

31:27.274 --> 31:29.610
to break their backs
will never afford them anything.

31:32.313 --> 31:35.884
A nation of imaginative,
dreaming fools.

31:39.353 --> 31:40.621
Why do you defend them?

31:43.290 --> 31:45.326
The United States
is falling apart.

31:47.797 --> 31:50.833
Their leaders have been waiting
for this opportunity.

31:51.834 --> 31:53.435
They want a war.

31:55.637 --> 31:56.638
Do you know why?

31:58.540 --> 31:59.909
No.

31:59.942 --> 32:01.844
The president
has led the nation

32:01.878 --> 32:05.747
into an economic catastrophe
from which there is no escape.

32:05.782 --> 32:09.551
An entire generation of youths
lost and jobless.

32:11.587 --> 32:14.457
The country is on the verge
of revolution.

32:14.490 --> 32:17.393
So, they send their sons
to be slaughtered.

32:18.796 --> 32:20.730
We will only war with America

32:20.764 --> 32:23.499
to save the people
from their government,

32:23.533 --> 32:25.568
and show them a way forward.

32:26.970 --> 32:28.738
You have found success here.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.975
You have found a life.

32:34.378 --> 32:35.379
Yes.

32:39.918 --> 32:42.821
Do not choose
to follow a path blindly

32:42.854 --> 32:44.388
because of your birthplace.

32:47.424 --> 32:50.527
Germany has opened
its arms to you.

32:50.561 --> 32:54.698
Stay with us, and you will know
what victory feels like.

32:57.068 --> 33:00.572
I don't have to remind you
that your American passport

33:00.605 --> 33:03.675
and travel papers
have been confiscated.

33:03.708 --> 33:06.946
This is an oath of allegiance
to the Reich.

33:09.647 --> 33:10.916
You must sign this

33:10.950 --> 33:12.751
if you are to continue
to live here.

33:50.992 --> 33:55.797
Um, pardon me,
Miss, uh, Miss Gillars?

33:56.696 --> 33:57.965
My name is Billy Owen.

34:05.072 --> 34:06.841
Are you just
going to stand there

34:06.874 --> 34:09.877
like a lost lemon,
or do you have a note

34:09.912 --> 34:12.114
that you'd like to
read out loud to me?

34:12.147 --> 34:15.716
Oh, uh.
I-I don't have a note.

34:16.852 --> 34:17.986
What a pity.

34:21.023 --> 34:22.557
- May I?
- Yes.

34:39.441 --> 34:42.377
Um, Mr. Laughlin thinks
that in the...

34:42.411 --> 34:44.479
I am not quite sure
I give a damn

34:44.513 --> 34:46.082
what Mr. Laughlin thinks.

34:48.617 --> 34:50.586
- He is the best, Miss Gillars.
- The best of what?

34:50.619 --> 34:53.522
A fast trial,
and an even faster execution?

34:54.190 --> 34:55.992
The best at saying nothing?

34:56.025 --> 34:57.693
The best at telling jokes,

34:57.726 --> 35:00.597
because he did an excellent job
at both of those today.

35:01.198 --> 35:03.666
But his reputation...

35:03.700 --> 35:06.003
That's what's really important
here, isn't it?

35:06.036 --> 35:07.670
The Green Hornet?

35:08.138 --> 35:09.739
The judge killer?

35:12.009 --> 35:16.546
A jury of 12 people
who already hate me

35:17.982 --> 35:22.419
could not give a hot damn
about my lawyer's reputation!

35:35.800 --> 35:39.137
He told me that this would all
be cleared up quickly.

35:41.672 --> 35:44.075
That I would have
another shot at Broadway

35:44.109 --> 35:45.643
from all the publicity.

35:49.614 --> 35:52.151
Miss Gillars, he...

35:55.087 --> 35:56.588
he's trying to help you.

36:01.060 --> 36:04.063
I was wondering about this
when I saw you out there.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.867
And unfortunately,
I was right.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.806
You are as naive and dumb
as you look.

36:15.175 --> 36:17.778
You may go now, Billy Owen.

36:22.950 --> 36:25.518
Well, thank you,
Miss Gillars, um.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.752
Have a nice day.

36:27.821 --> 36:28.956
Please?

37:10.199 --> 37:11.266
What'd you learn?

37:11.300 --> 37:13.235
Um,
she was born in Maine

37:13.268 --> 37:14.937
into a broken home.

37:14.970 --> 37:17.605
Her parents finally split
while she was still a teenager.

37:17.638 --> 37:19.908
Went to university
to study drama.

37:19.942 --> 37:21.243
She was actually a chorus girl.

37:21.276 --> 37:23.246
And, uh, she did
some vaudeville too.

37:23.279 --> 37:26.548
Moved to Berlin in 1933
where she taught English.

37:26.582 --> 37:27.784
Started working
for Radio Berlin...

37:27.817 --> 37:29.219
What are you...
giving me her obituary?

37:30.320 --> 37:32.022
Excuse me?

37:32.055 --> 37:34.690
Everything you just said
was in this morning's paper.

37:34.723 --> 37:36.558
- I read it.
- Oh, was it?

37:36.592 --> 37:37.593
Yeah.

37:40.330 --> 37:42.098
She didn't talk to you at all,
did she?

37:42.932 --> 37:44.034
- No.
- Oh.

37:44.067 --> 37:45.201
No, she didn't.

37:46.703 --> 37:49.073
You know the Senate
has a baseball team?

37:49.106 --> 37:51.641
Won 50 games last year.

37:52.143 --> 37:54.345
They lost 104.

37:54.378 --> 37:58.049
Finished in last place
in the American League.

37:58.082 --> 38:01.085
Forty-seven games behind
the first-place team,

38:01.118 --> 38:02.920
which eventually
won the championship,

38:02.953 --> 38:04.889
the New York Yankees.

38:04.922 --> 38:08.926
Winners worry about winning.

38:08.959 --> 38:12.596
Losers worry about winners.

38:12.630 --> 38:14.900
Uh, sir, I-I'm not sure
I understand.

38:15.834 --> 38:17.035
You're not gonna get very far

38:17.069 --> 38:20.005
chasing ambulances
on that bum leg.

38:20.038 --> 38:23.075
Alright, lock up
before you leave.

38:25.010 --> 38:26.111
Yes, sir.

38:29.414 --> 38:30.982
<i>Your Honor,
the prosecution would now</i>

38:31.016 --> 38:33.920
<i>like to play the recording
from June 17th, 1943.</i>

38:37.356 --> 38:39.225
<i>This is Berlin calling.</i>

38:39.258 --> 38:43.196
<i>Berlin calling the American
mothers and wives.</i>

38:43.229 --> 38:45.798
<i>It's a disgrace
to the American public</i>

38:45.832 --> 38:47.699
<i>that they don't
wake up to the fact</i>

38:47.732 --> 38:51.037
<i>of what Franklin Roosevelt
is doing to the gentiles</i>

38:51.070 --> 38:54.107
<i>of your country and my country.</i>

38:54.140 --> 38:56.409
<i>And I refuse to participate
in it,</i>

38:56.442 --> 38:59.947
<i>and insist on fighting
against it.</i>

38:59.980 --> 39:02.783
You can put American
uniform on our boys.

39:02.816 --> 39:04.284
You can put a rifle in their

39:04.318 --> 39:05.352
<i>hands...</i>

39:05.385 --> 39:06.353
Hey, Sally's on!

39:06.386 --> 39:07.321
<i>...you can send them</i>

39:07.354 --> 39:10.756
<i>across the borders
to destroy Germany,</i>

39:10.791 --> 39:13.759
but you can never
bring understanding

39:13.794 --> 39:15.996
between the Americans
and the British.

39:19.099 --> 39:21.101
I say, forget Roosevelt,

39:21.135 --> 39:23.838
<i>and Churchill,
who made this war possible.</i>

39:24.405 --> 39:26.040
<i>As an American girl,</i>

39:26.074 --> 39:28.409
<i>I stay over here
on this side of the fence.</i>

39:28.443 --> 39:31.379
'Cause Germany's
the side that's the right side.

39:31.412 --> 39:35.150
In reality, there's no war
between Germany and America,

39:35.183 --> 39:38.119
but a war between
the Jews and the gentiles.

39:38.153 --> 39:39.420
<i>And I almost forgot,</i>

39:39.454 --> 39:40.989
<i>I want to say hello to</i>

39:41.022 --> 39:42.790
<i>the 36th Infantry Division...</i>

39:42.824 --> 39:44.758
<i>...who just landed
outside Tobruk.</i>

39:44.792 --> 39:47.863
Maybe tonight she'll say
something about Jimmy's unit.

39:47.897 --> 39:49.932
<i>You will soon be welcomed</i>

39:49.965 --> 39:53.002
<i>by a sizable
German greeting party.</i>

39:53.035 --> 39:55.104
<i>And while you're over there
fighting for Roosevelt</i>

39:55.137 --> 39:58.073
<i>and all his Jewish cohorts,
I do hope</i>

39:58.107 --> 40:00.809
that way back
in your hometown,

40:00.843 --> 40:04.246
nobody will be
making eyes at honey.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.948
<i>Are you thinking about</i>

40:05.981 --> 40:09.351
<i>what your girlfriends and wives
are doing tonight, fellas?</i>

40:09.385 --> 40:13.123
<i>You don't really blame them
for wanting some fun, do you?</i>

40:13.156 --> 40:15.325
The last thing in the world
they want is for you boys

40:15.358 --> 40:17.394
to get all mutilated
and broken up

40:17.427 --> 40:21.064
from fighting with
the unbeatable German Army.

40:21.097 --> 40:24.201
Any girl likes to have her man
in one piece.

40:24.234 --> 40:27.204
<i>I'm only saying
this because I care about you.</i>

40:27.237 --> 40:28.104
<i>I don't want to see</i>

40:28.138 --> 40:30.173
<i>your lives wasted
for that mental,</i>

40:30.207 --> 40:33.143
<i>moral, and physical cripple
of a president of yours.</i>

40:35.246 --> 40:37.114

Uh, yes.

43:26.357 --> 43:27.492
Ja.

43:32.363 --> 43:34.165
That's what I recall.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.435
You went off script.

43:37.468 --> 43:39.504
Dr. Goebbels, since the
beginning of my acting career,

43:39.537 --> 43:42.507
I've been taught that you're
supposed to convey the feelings.

43:42.540 --> 43:44.442
Not-not necessarily
word for word,

43:44.475 --> 43:46.345
that sometimes
you go off script.

43:52.017 --> 43:53.152
Dr. Goebbels?

43:57.423 --> 43:58.991
Unbeatable.

44:01.193 --> 44:04.029
is simply the opposite
of beatable.

44:06.398 --> 44:09.502
There's no opposite
for the word "invincible".

44:11.237 --> 44:13.640
That was the word
I used in your script,

44:13.673 --> 44:16.643
which you failed
to express correctly.

44:59.354 --> 45:03.091
Did you notice anything, Max,
when you were leaving?

45:07.329 --> 45:08.330
No.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.734
I want outta here.

45:20.208 --> 45:22.378
I have an idea
for a new show.

45:24.780 --> 45:26.382
It's called <i>Letters to Home.</i>

45:28.518 --> 45:33.389
We'll visit.
prisoner of war camps,

45:33.422 --> 45:38.194
and you will interview
American POWs.

45:38.227 --> 45:41.564
<i>It'll show parents back home
that their sons are alive,</i>

45:41.597 --> 45:43.065
<i>and are getting treatment.</i>

45:44.801 --> 45:49.339
<i>Dr. Goebbels would approve
because it will show Germans</i>

45:49.373 --> 45:53.176
<i>treating Americans
with such kindness, care.</i>

45:56.780 --> 46:00.818
<i>Soldiers can record messages
and send them back home.</i>

46:00.852 --> 46:03.387
Hello, gang,
Midge calling.

46:03.420 --> 46:07.157
I'm interviewing a very nice
soldier named Harold,

46:07.190 --> 46:08.759
from New York City.

46:08.792 --> 46:12.130
And Harold would like to speak
to his sister and mom.

46:13.565 --> 46:16.334
<i>Everyone would tune in</i>

46:16.367 --> 46:19.404
<i>because they'll get the news
faster than from anywhere else.</i>

46:21.639 --> 46:23.107
You're brave
and beautiful to me.

46:23.141 --> 46:26.077
Okay.
Let's get a big smile here.

46:27.645 --> 46:29.547
<i>After all,</i>

46:29.581 --> 46:33.218
<i>Germans and Americans
aren't really enemies.</i>

46:33.252 --> 46:34.787
Anybody for some
Apennine nectar?

46:34.821 --> 46:36.555
Yeah!

46:36.589 --> 46:38.324
It's actually a little
stronger than Appenine.

46:40.593 --> 46:42.796
Johnny, would you
like to say a few words

46:42.829 --> 46:47.166
to those back home,
maybe family or a sweetheart?

46:47.199 --> 46:49.803
To Alison,
and tell her I love her.

46:49.836 --> 46:51.437
Oh.

46:51.470 --> 46:52.906
One, two, three.

46:52.939 --> 46:55.574
Massimale!

47:02.817 --> 47:05.418
<i>Do you know,
without a doubt,</i>

47:05.452 --> 47:07.454
that the woman
who interviewed you

47:07.487 --> 47:09.456
as a prisoner of war

47:09.489 --> 47:13.360
while she was masquerading
in a Red Cross uniform,

47:13.393 --> 47:15.863
is this woman right there?

47:15.896 --> 47:17.230
Everyone kept whispering

47:17.263 --> 47:20.233
that it was the famous
Axis Sally,

47:20.266 --> 47:22.570
but she called herself
another name.

47:22.603 --> 47:24.238
And how did you respond?

47:24.271 --> 47:26.374
To tell you the truth,

47:26.407 --> 47:30.444
I had a hard time concentrating
on anything she was saying.

47:30.478 --> 47:32.546
And why is that?

47:32.580 --> 47:34.850
- Well, um, sir...
- Yeah.

47:34.883 --> 47:36.852
- When she sat down...
- Yes?

47:36.885 --> 47:39.855
She didn't leave
a lot to the imagination.

47:41.355 --> 47:43.524
Really?
I don't quite understand that.

47:43.557 --> 47:45.560
Would you describe what it was?

47:45.594 --> 47:47.229
Well, um, sir.

47:47.262 --> 47:48.296
Yeah?

47:48.330 --> 47:49.932
When she moved
forward a bit.

47:49.966 --> 47:51.266
Hmm.

47:51.299 --> 47:52.334
.to adjust
the microphone.

47:52.367 --> 47:53.502
Hmm.

47:53.535 --> 47:56.605
I saw. quite a-a bit.

47:56.638 --> 47:58.841
You saw quite a bit?

47:58.875 --> 48:01.911
Well, can you describe
what it was that you saw?

48:01.944 --> 48:03.512
I don't know that I can

48:03.545 --> 48:04.981
- say it in mixed company, sir.
- Oh, come on.

48:05.014 --> 48:07.282
You could say it.
You could say it here.

48:07.315 --> 48:09.920
Look, I'm sure everyone here
has heard

48:09.953 --> 48:12.856
quite a bit of everything
during this trial.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.893
Won't you-won't you
enlighten us, please?

48:15.926 --> 48:17.760
Are you serious, sir?

48:19.796 --> 48:22.665
I'm as serious
as the metal plate

48:22.699 --> 48:24.902
in your forehead, buddy.

48:24.935 --> 48:27.670
There's a woman's life
on the line.

48:27.704 --> 48:31.474
And you testified that she
somehow made you say things

48:31.507 --> 48:34.344
you wouldn't normally have said.

48:34.378 --> 48:36.680
So, what is
so all-fired secretive

48:36.714 --> 48:38.716
you can't let it out?

48:38.749 --> 48:40.819
Let it out.
Come on. Let's hear it.

48:40.852 --> 48:44.688
It wasn't just
the cleavage showing, sir.

48:44.722 --> 48:47.291
She wasn't wearing
any underwear.

48:51.595 --> 48:55.299
Oh, well, that is
understandable, don't you think?

48:56.333 --> 48:57.368
Defense rests.

49:00.873 --> 49:02.975
You were interviewed
as a prisoner of war, correct?

49:03.008 --> 49:05.811
Yes, sir. I had been a part of
the Army's 29th Division

49:05.845 --> 49:06.912
when I got captured.

49:09.882 --> 49:11.917
Alright.
Where are we calling?

49:11.951 --> 49:13.718
Calling the greatest town
in the world.

49:13.752 --> 49:15.453
Minot, North Dakota.

49:15.487 --> 49:16.788
So who do you have in Minot?

49:16.822 --> 49:19.657
Got my girl, Margaret,
and our firstborn son.

49:19.691 --> 49:21.061
He's a handsome boy.
He looks like his daddy.

49:21.094 --> 49:22.095
I bet.

49:22.129 --> 49:24.965
I bet. And what would you
like to say to them?

49:24.998 --> 49:26.665
How are you doing?

49:26.699 --> 49:29.035
Fever's low.
Spirits are high.

49:29.069 --> 49:31.337
Got a little shrapnel
tickling my leg,

49:31.370 --> 49:32.438
but I'm gonna be alright.

49:32.471 --> 49:34.607
She told me and another group
of wounded soldiers

49:34.640 --> 49:36.308
that our folks back home
would be happy to hear

49:36.342 --> 49:38.845
that we're still alive
and bein' treated well.

49:38.879 --> 49:40.379
And were you treated well?

49:41.380 --> 49:43.682
No, sir. Not exactly.

49:43.716 --> 49:45.685
But, well, I guess
you are in a makeshift hospital

49:45.719 --> 49:47.021
and they're doing
the best they can,

49:47.054 --> 49:48.823
under the circumstances.

49:48.856 --> 49:50.457
They're not
doing much, ma'am.

49:50.490 --> 49:52.960
A soldier's life,
you kind of take it as it comes.

49:56.363 --> 49:58.532
Hello, gang, it's Midge.

49:58.565 --> 50:00.968
I'm coming to you
from a hospital in Germany

50:01.002 --> 50:04.638
where I have a handsome young
soldier named Andrew

50:04.671 --> 50:05.772
- from North Carolina...
- <i>Can you identify</i>

50:05.807 --> 50:07.440
the person who interrogated you

50:07.474 --> 50:09.343
in a German
prisoner of war camp?

50:09.377 --> 50:10.678
It was her.

50:10.711 --> 50:12.747
I told her
that I recognized her voice.

50:12.780 --> 50:13.816
What did she say?

50:13.849 --> 50:14.950
She smiled and said,

50:14.983 --> 50:16.584
"I guess you know me
as Axis Sally?"

50:18.686 --> 50:19.720
And how did you answer her?

50:21.890 --> 50:22.991
I told her
that we knew her

50:23.025 --> 50:25.093
by a few other choice names.

50:30.032 --> 50:31.867
After you and the others
had talked to her,

50:31.900 --> 50:32.969
what happened?

50:33.002 --> 50:34.503
Well, I didn't know
at the time, sir,

50:34.536 --> 50:35.872
but when I got back home,

50:35.905 --> 50:38.107
I found out they had
edited the tapes

50:38.141 --> 50:40.409
to make it sound like
something completely different.

50:40.442 --> 50:42.511
Can you remember
anything specific?

50:42.544 --> 50:45.114
She made it sound like
we thought it was a disgrace

50:45.148 --> 50:46.816
what President Roosevelt
had allowed to happen

50:46.850 --> 50:49.518
to us fighting men,
and that it was a futile war.

50:50.752 --> 50:52.889
This woman
sold out our country.

50:52.922 --> 50:56.758
Yes. You mentioned that
repeatedly now.

50:56.792 --> 50:59.029
Did she undermine your morale?

50:59.063 --> 51:00.130
Absolutely.

51:00.164 --> 51:02.099
- She... she did?
- Absolutely.

51:02.132 --> 51:04.467
How did she
undermine your morale?

51:04.500 --> 51:06.569
That's what I'd like.
How'd she do it?

51:06.603 --> 51:08.438
My morale was upset
by this woman

51:08.471 --> 51:09.606
working for the Germans.

51:09.639 --> 51:13.043
I see.
Now, you were a paratrooper.

51:13.077 --> 51:15.946
You know, you used to fly
behind enemy lines

51:15.980 --> 51:17.848
and jump out, right?

51:17.882 --> 51:18.983
- Correct.
- Yeah.

51:21.019 --> 51:25.656
Do you recall a tune named,
"Germany Is Marching On"?

51:25.689 --> 51:27.993
You remember that?

51:28.026 --> 51:29.493
Doesn't ring a bell. No.

51:29.526 --> 51:31.863
No? Well, maybe this'll help.

51:31.897 --> 51:32.998
Billy.

51:44.876 --> 51:49.081
<i>♪ And Germany
Keeps marching on ♪</i>

51:49.115 --> 51:52.985
♪ And Germany
Keeps marching on ♪

51:56.889 --> 51:57.957
I recall the tune.

51:57.990 --> 51:59.724
Yeah.

51:59.758 --> 52:03.162
As you say now,
that upset your morale?

52:03.195 --> 52:05.597
Your will to fight in the war?

52:05.630 --> 52:06.631
That's what I said.

52:07.900 --> 52:09.236
Well, it seems
a little hypersensitive

52:09.269 --> 52:11.671
for a man who jumps
out of planes

52:11.704 --> 52:13.240
behind enemy lines,
don't you think?

52:13.273 --> 52:14.807
Objection!

52:14.841 --> 52:18.912
Sustained.
Watch your step, Mr. Laughlin.

52:18.946 --> 52:21.747
I'm sorry for stepping
on the truth, Your Honor.

52:34.262 --> 52:35.964
Mr. Laughlin,
can I ask you something?

52:37.531 --> 52:41.601
Yeah, just make it quick,
Billy, please. What?

52:41.635 --> 52:43.670
Have you thought about
using the First Amendment

52:43.704 --> 52:45.772
as a defense?

52:45.806 --> 52:48.109
Well, that's
freshman stuff, Billy.

52:48.142 --> 52:50.610
Introduction to Law 101.

52:52.814 --> 52:54.082
The prosecution is saying

52:54.115 --> 52:57.019
she aided and abetted
our enemies.

52:57.052 --> 53:00.055
You want to argue
freedom of speech?

53:00.089 --> 53:01.256
I'm sorry.

53:01.290 --> 53:06.061
Alright. Well, what about
the Expatriation Act of 1868?

53:08.097 --> 53:10.199
I don't have time
for this, Billy, please.

53:10.232 --> 53:12.034
She renounced
her American citizenship

53:12.067 --> 53:14.236
and swore allegiance
to the Third Reich.

53:14.269 --> 53:16.637
Yeah. Ah-huh. Ah-huh.

53:16.671 --> 53:17.672
Right.

53:19.108 --> 53:21.244
You can't commit treason
if you're not a citizen.

53:21.277 --> 53:24.014
You know, it's not
that you're not smart, Billy.

53:24.047 --> 53:25.849
You're just dumb. That's all.

53:25.882 --> 53:28.184
Sir, what... what does
that have to do with anything?

53:28.218 --> 53:31.254
You know, there's things they
don't teach you in law school.

53:31.287 --> 53:33.722
Like how the world works.
You know, the bigger picture.

53:34.891 --> 53:37.559
Actors on a stage

53:37.593 --> 53:40.230
aren't the only one
with a role to play.

53:40.263 --> 53:42.832
And not every player
in this game

53:42.866 --> 53:44.267
shows up in the courthouse.

53:45.903 --> 53:47.771
Newspapers have to be sold.

53:47.804 --> 53:51.108
Politicians make promises
they got to keep.

53:51.142 --> 53:53.777
And the American public,

53:53.810 --> 53:56.113
they need retaliation
for the war.

53:56.147 --> 53:58.049
Don't they? Hmm.

54:01.218 --> 54:02.652
Did you make a deal?

54:04.721 --> 54:06.357
Well, what are...
what are you talking about?

54:06.390 --> 54:07.624
- Of course, I made a deal.
- Did you make a deal?

54:07.657 --> 54:09.294
I made a deal.
Of course!

54:09.327 --> 54:10.228
I always make a deal.

54:10.262 --> 54:12.898
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't make a deal.

54:12.931 --> 54:14.799
That's the job description.

54:16.734 --> 54:18.303
Alright.

54:18.336 --> 54:23.975
Here, let's imagine
I argue expatriation.

54:24.009 --> 54:25.277
Do you know what that means?

54:25.310 --> 54:28.146
For all the other Americans
who went over there

54:28.180 --> 54:31.615
and contributed
to the German war effort?

54:31.649 --> 54:33.219
Now no one
will get held accountable

54:33.252 --> 54:35.922
for their actions, right?

54:35.955 --> 54:37.123
What would that mean?

54:37.156 --> 54:39.658
Get it?

54:39.691 --> 54:40.993
But she didn't do anything.

54:41.027 --> 54:42.395
What did you say?

54:42.428 --> 54:44.197
But she didn't do anything.

54:46.232 --> 54:49.801
Boy, you got some extra bone
in that head of yours.

54:49.836 --> 54:51.636
Doesn't matter, Billy.

54:51.670 --> 54:53.738
Get it through your skull.
It just doesn't matter.

54:53.772 --> 54:54.773
But her life is at stake.

54:54.806 --> 54:57.945
I mean, doesn't that mean
anything to you, sir?

54:57.978 --> 55:00.914
I know the picture of death.

55:00.948 --> 55:03.616
You understand?
I got it framed right here.

55:05.319 --> 55:06.353
Have you seen it?

55:09.123 --> 55:10.824
I'm sorry, sir.

55:10.858 --> 55:13.693
I...

55:13.726 --> 55:15.262
I didn't know.

55:15.295 --> 55:16.997
No, because
your mouth is open.

55:18.398 --> 55:21.002
Listen, don't you come up here
with your dick on fire

55:21.035 --> 55:23.071
and question my morality.

55:23.104 --> 55:24.805
You just keep taking notes

55:24.839 --> 55:27.808
and dreaming about getting laid
by Goebbels' ex-whore.

55:27.842 --> 55:29.010
- Go ahead.
- I-I...

55:29.043 --> 55:30.411
I'm not dreaming
about getting laid

55:30.445 --> 55:32.914
- by Goebbels... is this...
- Well then, wake the fuck up!

55:37.051 --> 55:39.187
You wanna keep your job, Billy?

55:39.220 --> 55:40.654
Seriously?

55:41.222 --> 55:42.290
Yes.

55:42.323 --> 55:43.825
Really?
You wanna keep it?

55:43.858 --> 55:44.960
Yes, sir.

55:44.994 --> 55:46.362
Do me one thing.

55:46.395 --> 55:48.931
Keep your mouth shut
during the trial

55:48.964 --> 55:51.367
and in the courthouse,
and you'll keep your job.

55:53.969 --> 55:54.970
Yes, sir.

55:56.205 --> 55:58.207
See, we just made a deal.

56:20.964 --> 56:22.999
Kitchen's closed, kid.

56:23.033 --> 56:24.733
Come back another time.

56:28.371 --> 56:30.240
I listened to you
during the war.

56:32.342 --> 56:34.811
And you made me laugh at a time
when nothing else did.

56:36.347 --> 56:37.814
I wasn't the only one either.

56:40.851 --> 56:42.320
And I'm watching
all these guys come in

56:42.353 --> 56:44.222
and exaggerate
the way they felt.

56:46.224 --> 56:47.791
It really burns me up.

56:51.829 --> 56:54.899
I know I'm not the guy up there
asking the questions, but...

56:59.438 --> 57:01.806
I just want you to know
that I'm on your side.

57:04.876 --> 57:06.245
Cards might be stacked
against us,

57:06.278 --> 57:09.881
but I didn't come back
from Okinawa

57:09.915 --> 57:11.416
without learning how to fight.

57:26.332 --> 57:27.433
This is for you.

57:34.040 --> 57:35.508
Ah, oh-oh.

57:37.110 --> 57:38.211
Hmm.

57:42.215 --> 57:43.316
Hmm.

57:43.349 --> 57:44.384
Oh.

57:45.953 --> 57:48.889
Hmm.

57:48.922 --> 57:50.958
I feel like a kid at Christmas.

57:54.128 --> 57:55.162
Thank you.

58:00.167 --> 58:01.502
Okay, kid.

All right.

1:04:30.707 --> 1:04:34.913
So, Billy sent me down here,
said you want to talk to me,

1:04:34.946 --> 1:04:37.815
you got something to say
that will change the whole case.

1:04:39.683 --> 1:04:41.685
I tried to kill
Dr. Joseph Goebbels.

1:04:44.889 --> 1:04:47.524
Is that what you brought me
down here for, to tell me that?

1:04:47.558 --> 1:04:50.360
Yes. Yes.

1:04:50.394 --> 1:04:51.695
Didn't that mean
something to you?

1:04:51.729 --> 1:04:52.796
Take it easy.

1:04:54.364 --> 1:04:56.801
Did anyone see you try this?

1:04:56.835 --> 1:05:00.739
Someone we can call on
to testify?

1:05:00.772 --> 1:05:02.273
Anybody?

1:05:02.307 --> 1:05:04.009
No.

1:05:04.043 --> 1:05:05.543
Then it didn't happen.

1:05:06.912 --> 1:05:08.379
But it's true.

1:05:08.413 --> 1:05:09.514
Yeah.

1:05:13.418 --> 1:05:14.786
Talk to me,
tell me this truth.

1:05:21.460 --> 1:05:22.561
Let's do it.

1:05:24.730 --> 1:05:28.801
Okay, Dr. Goebbels
wanted me in his hotel.

1:05:28.834 --> 1:05:30.603
- Yes.
- And I was in the room.

1:05:30.636 --> 1:05:31.837
- Yes.
- And there was a gun

1:05:31.872 --> 1:05:33.806
on the table.

1:05:33.839 --> 1:05:37.376
I reached for the gun,
I pointed it at his head.

1:05:37.409 --> 1:05:38.711
And I pulled the trigger.

1:05:42.381 --> 1:05:43.549
And then?

1:05:45.853 --> 1:05:46.988
No bullets.

1:05:48.923 --> 1:05:50.490
No bullets?

1:05:50.524 --> 1:05:51.792
I hoped to kill him.

1:05:51.825 --> 1:05:56.931
Uh-huh.
Hoping the hope.

1:05:56.964 --> 1:06:00.367
Well, that's not the best
situation to be in, now, is it?

1:06:00.400 --> 1:06:02.335
- Hm-mm.
- No.

1:06:03.905 --> 1:06:06.706
Did anyone
see this thing, now?

1:06:06.740 --> 1:06:09.310
No.
I told Max about it.

1:06:09.978 --> 1:06:13.581
Yeah, well, Max is dead.

1:06:13.614 --> 1:06:15.017
Yes.

1:06:15.050 --> 1:06:18.987
So, your assassination
attempt failed.

1:06:19.821 --> 1:06:22.590
You have no witnesses.

1:06:22.623 --> 1:06:26.561
And now, everyone who was
alive at the time is dead.

1:06:28.864 --> 1:06:30.331
But it's the truth.

1:06:33.468 --> 1:06:34.603
You've to prove it.

1:06:37.706 --> 1:06:41.878
What is reality,
and what we have to accept,

1:06:41.911 --> 1:06:45.380
is not always the truth,
and that's the truth.

1:06:47.783 --> 1:06:49.152
I had lived in Germany
for five years

1:06:49.185 --> 1:06:50.987
before the war even started.

1:06:52.521 --> 1:06:54.590
I had a life there.
I was in love.

1:06:54.623 --> 1:06:56.060
- Hm-mm.
- I never had

1:06:56.093 --> 1:06:57.760
those things in the States.

1:07:01.932 --> 1:07:04.701
And they took my papers,
Mr. Laughlin.

1:07:04.734 --> 1:07:05.903
I couldn't go anywhere.

1:07:05.936 --> 1:07:08.105
I couldn't return to the States.

1:07:08.138 --> 1:07:09.505
Hm-mm.

1:07:09.539 --> 1:07:10.807
What was I supposed to do?

1:07:12.508 --> 1:07:13.376
Everybody likes to think

1:07:13.409 --> 1:07:15.980
that they would always do
the right thing,

1:07:16.013 --> 1:07:17.948
always make the right choice.

1:07:19.216 --> 1:07:22.620
But it is not like that in war.

1:07:24.022 --> 1:07:25.723
There's no right and wrong.

1:07:28.193 --> 1:07:32.496
There's just death and survival.

1:07:34.498 --> 1:07:36.001
And I did what I could
to survive.

1:07:39.137 --> 1:07:41.106
What would you have done,
Mr. Laughlin?

1:07:46.979 --> 1:07:49.181
I probably woulda
tried to kill Goebbels too.

1:08:01.928 --> 1:08:04.096
This is Berlin calling.

1:08:04.130 --> 1:08:07.465
And when Berlin calls,
it pays to listen in.

1:08:13.572 --> 1:08:15.608
Instead of
our regular program,

1:08:15.641 --> 1:08:20.613
we want to present a play
entitled <i>Vision of Invasion.</i>

1:08:20.646 --> 1:08:24.117
When you performed in the play
<i>Visions of Invasion,</i>

1:08:24.151 --> 1:08:26.853
what do you recall
about Miss Gillars?

1:08:26.887 --> 1:08:28.587
She was quite a good actress.

1:08:28.621 --> 1:08:30.190
So, she was serious
about the role?

1:08:30.223 --> 1:08:31.524
Extremely, sir.

1:08:31.557 --> 1:08:34.062
Objection!
Your Honor!

1:08:34.095 --> 1:08:37.098
The witness's opinion of
Mildred Gillars' performance

1:08:37.131 --> 1:08:38.765
is in no way
relevant to this case.

1:08:38.799 --> 1:08:40.134
Oh, come on, Counsel!
Don't be absurd.

1:08:40.168 --> 1:08:41.835
Of course, it is!

1:08:41.869 --> 1:08:43.503
She was the star
of a radio play

1:08:43.537 --> 1:08:46.174
that predicted American soldiers
being slaughtered like pigs.

1:08:46.207 --> 1:08:50.544
This was psychological warfare
in which she was a soldier!

1:08:50.577 --> 1:08:53.014
<i>You know,
I sometimes have dreams.</i>

1:08:53.047 --> 1:08:54.815
premonitions.

1:08:54.848 --> 1:08:57.286
I can't stop thinking about
one I just had

1:08:57.319 --> 1:08:59.989
about all of our young men
getting ready for D-Day

1:09:00.022 --> 1:09:01.223
and the invasion of France.

1:09:02.657 --> 1:09:04.093
D-Day!

1:09:04.126 --> 1:09:08.030
D stands for doom and disaster,
defeat and death!

1:09:08.063 --> 1:09:10.565
Did you consider
not accepting your role

1:09:10.598 --> 1:09:11.666
in the play?

1:09:11.699 --> 1:09:13.068
No, of course not.

1:09:13.102 --> 1:09:14.736
Why not?

1:09:14.769 --> 1:09:16.939
Saying no was never an option.

1:09:16.972 --> 1:09:19.841
What would have happened if
you refused to play your part?

1:09:19.875 --> 1:09:23.947
My wife,
my children and myself

1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:26.682
might have been sent
to a concentration camp.

1:09:26.715 --> 1:09:28.784
Come with me
halfway around the world

1:09:28.817 --> 1:09:31.154
as Evelyn's vision continues.

1:09:31.187 --> 1:09:34.290
In her dream,
she sees her despondent son

1:09:34.324 --> 1:09:37.093
aboard the troop ship,
speaking to his buddy.

1:09:38.761 --> 1:09:40.063
They say
we've got the go-ahead

1:09:40.096 --> 1:09:42.332
to go hit the beaches.

1:09:42.365 --> 1:09:45.236
I wonder what will happen to us?

1:09:45.269 --> 1:09:46.703
I've got a feeling inside

1:09:46.736 --> 1:09:49.106
that we'll never
see the States again.

1:09:49.140 --> 1:09:51.208
I was just thinking
what Mother is doing now

1:09:51.242 --> 1:09:53.576
and what she's heard.

1:09:53.610 --> 1:09:57.248
I was dreaming, son,
but you are real.

1:09:57.781 --> 1:10:00.051
You are home. Safe.

1:10:01.851 --> 1:10:04.221
Alan, I'm so happy.

1:10:04.255 --> 1:10:07.657
Mr. Houben,
you were the manager

1:10:07.690 --> 1:10:09.361
of the overseas division

1:10:09.394 --> 1:10:12.230
of the German Broadcasting
Company during the war.

1:10:12.264 --> 1:10:13.298
Were you not?

1:10:13.331 --> 1:10:14.598
Yes, sir.

1:10:14.632 --> 1:10:16.734
Do you remember
the defendant

1:10:16.767 --> 1:10:22.140
working on a radio play
named <i>Vision of Invasion?</i>

1:10:22.174 --> 1:10:25.277
Yes, sir. I was there
when they recorded it.

1:10:25.310 --> 1:10:27.145
Do you remember
if everyone in the play,

1:10:27.179 --> 1:10:30.681
including Miss Gillars,
read from a script?

1:10:30.714 --> 1:10:33.718
Yes, sir.
They always used a script.

1:10:33.752 --> 1:10:36.989
Oh!
Something horrible happened!

1:10:37.023 --> 1:10:38.891
Alan is dead!

1:10:38.925 --> 1:10:40.993
What's the matter,
my dear?

1:10:41.027 --> 1:10:43.129
Bad dreams again?

1:10:43.162 --> 1:10:45.264
He was right here
in the room!

1:10:45.298 --> 1:10:46.698
It was real.

1:10:48.367 --> 1:10:49.936
Who was the scriptwriter?

1:10:50.903 --> 1:10:52.171
Max Otto Koischwitz.

1:10:53.272 --> 1:10:54.840
Not Miss Gillars.

1:10:54.874 --> 1:10:56.043
- No.
- No.

1:10:56.742 --> 1:10:57.978
Bravo.

1:11:01.448 --> 1:11:02.682
Prost.

1:11:05.185 --> 1:11:06.652
Hmm.

1:11:06.686 --> 1:11:07.888
You were fantastic.

1:11:08.989 --> 1:11:11.657
The whole country
was listening.

1:11:11.691 --> 1:11:14.161
Dr. Goebbels,
Der Fuhrer himself.

1:11:14.194 --> 1:11:16.196
Mm.
Will it do any good?

1:11:17.197 --> 1:11:19.433
Hmm.
Somehow. Of course.

1:11:19.466 --> 1:11:21.035
Ooh.

1:11:21.069 --> 1:11:23.338
Max? Max?

1:11:24.973 --> 1:11:26.341
It's nothing.
Maybe the wine.

1:11:26.374 --> 1:11:27.976
I'm fatigued.
Stress. That's all.

1:11:28.009 --> 1:11:29.144
You should rest.

1:11:29.177 --> 1:11:30.677
No, no.

1:11:30.711 --> 1:11:32.981
Now, we're celebrating.

1:11:33.014 --> 1:11:34.681
This is another beginning
for us.

1:11:35.416 --> 1:11:36.417
I hope so.

1:11:38.019 --> 1:11:41.289
Max, you have a fever.
We have to get you into bed.

1:11:41.322 --> 1:11:43.024
Come.

1:11:43.057 --> 1:11:45.760
Tell me, do... do you
remember ever Miss Gillars

1:11:45.793 --> 1:11:48.063
going off the script
during that production.

1:11:48.097 --> 1:11:50.166
You know, saying the words
she wanted to say?

1:11:50.199 --> 1:11:51.300
No.

1:11:51.333 --> 1:11:54.303
Do you remember
any time the actors,

1:11:54.336 --> 1:11:58.974
on any of the readings
of the programs, went off script

1:11:59.008 --> 1:12:00.309
or refused to follow
the directions

1:12:00.342 --> 1:12:02.144
written on the script?

1:12:02.878 --> 1:12:03.879
Yes.

1:12:04.846 --> 1:12:06.148
Hm-mm.

1:12:06.182 --> 1:12:08.751
And what happened to anyone who
refused to follow directions?

1:12:09.785 --> 1:12:12.189
They disappeared.

1:12:12.788 --> 1:12:16.059
Disappeared?
Vanished?

1:12:16.493 --> 1:12:18.028
No, sir.

1:12:18.061 --> 1:12:20.964
No?
What happened to them?

1:12:20.997 --> 1:12:23.699
The man who held
the position before me did it.

1:12:24.467 --> 1:12:26.269
And what happened to him?

1:12:26.303 --> 1:12:27.437
He and his family

1:12:27.470 --> 1:12:29.439
were sent
to a concentration camp.

1:12:32.076 --> 1:12:34.312
So, it wouldn't have been
out of the ordinary

1:12:34.345 --> 1:12:37.081
if Miss Gillars
had refused to read the script

1:12:37.114 --> 1:12:38.815
or follow the notes,

1:12:38.848 --> 1:12:41.352
that the same thing
might have happened to her?

1:12:41.385 --> 1:12:44.088
Either that,
or she would have been shot

1:12:44.121 --> 1:12:48.125
like several other
broadcasters we all knew.

1:12:50.428 --> 1:12:53.097
Were you ever threatened
in connection with your work?

1:12:53.130 --> 1:12:54.398
Objection!

1:12:54.432 --> 1:12:56.801
This is... this is ridiculous,
Your Honor.

1:12:56.834 --> 1:12:59.071
Counsel, approach the bench.

1:13:05.410 --> 1:13:06.478
Your Honor...

1:13:06.511 --> 1:13:08.013
Your Honor,
we have established

1:13:08.046 --> 1:13:09.814
time and time again
in this trial

1:13:09.847 --> 1:13:11.049
that the fear of punishment

1:13:11.083 --> 1:13:13.018
does not constitute
actual punishment.

1:13:13.051 --> 1:13:15.853
The defense continues to put
witnesses on the stand

1:13:15.887 --> 1:13:18.890
and goads them into saying they
were in fear for their lives,

1:13:18.924 --> 1:13:20.960
which has never been
the question at hand.

1:13:20.994 --> 1:13:24.796
The whole world knows
that life in Germany was scary,

1:13:24.830 --> 1:13:28.434
but that in no way
excuses a criminal act.

1:13:28.468 --> 1:13:30.802
I don't know how much clearer
this can be made.

1:13:30.836 --> 1:13:33.306
If the defense could produce
a witness

1:13:33.339 --> 1:13:35.908
who was actually
threatened themselves,

1:13:35.942 --> 1:13:37.910
we would have no objections.

1:13:37.944 --> 1:13:40.013
Mr. Kelley,
do you have anything to add?

1:13:41.314 --> 1:13:45.019
No. I think
that just about sums it up.

1:13:45.052 --> 1:13:47.521
Dare I ask,
Mr. Laughlin?

1:13:47.554 --> 1:13:51.525
To her point, the dead
don't talk, Your Honor.

1:13:51.558 --> 1:13:55.162
So, if they did, we'd have
a lot of witnesses.

1:13:55.195 --> 1:13:57.031
As it is, you can't subpoena

1:13:57.064 --> 1:13:59.867
someone who's six feet
under the ground.

1:13:59.900 --> 1:14:03.037
And I am bound by the rules.
That is all.

1:14:03.070 --> 1:14:07.107
And hearsay and speculation are
not allowed in a court of law.

1:14:07.141 --> 1:14:09.177
Thank you, Your Honor.

1:14:09.210 --> 1:14:10.545
I didn't know that.

1:14:18.953 --> 1:14:21.956
<i>And
on the 5th day of June 1944,</i>

1:14:21.990 --> 1:14:23.625
<i>just as you see them here,</i>

1:14:23.658 --> 1:14:27.095
<i>a fleet of more than 4,000
ships put out from England.</i>

1:14:29.130 --> 1:14:30.565
<i>Paris is liberated.</i>

1:14:30.598 --> 1:14:32.201
<i>Cheering crowds
line the streets</i>

1:14:32.234 --> 1:14:35.037
<i>as the Allies speed
through the outskirts.</i>

1:14:35.071 --> 1:14:37.039
<i>Freedom
comes back to Greece.</i>

1:14:41.010 --> 1:14:42.345
<i>Field Marshal von Rundstedt</i>

1:14:42.378 --> 1:14:45.381
<i>struck with 20 divisions
on a 40-mile front.</i>

1:14:45.414 --> 1:14:47.016
<i>The Battle of the Bulge.</i>

1:14:48.384 --> 1:14:50.986
This is all been
hard for me to witness,

1:14:51.020 --> 1:14:54.990
as it was been hard for you
to listen to, girls.

1:14:55.024 --> 1:14:59.496
My thoughts go out to Margaret,
Delbert's wife tonight,

1:14:59.529 --> 1:15:01.298
and to their young son.

1:15:01.331 --> 1:15:03.900
And I hope that Delbert
will be home to you soon.

1:15:05.936 --> 1:15:09.272
We have two more soldiers
to report on.

1:15:09.306 --> 1:15:12.209
<i>There's Louis Koch
from Milwaukee.</i>

1:15:12.242 --> 1:15:15.412
<i>I have a report
from the 4th of December.</i>

1:15:15.445 --> 1:15:18.148
It states that he had a crushing
fracture of the right arm

1:15:18.181 --> 1:15:21.552
<i>which was so bad
that the doctors had to amputate.</i>

1:15:21.586 --> 1:15:25.690
<i>A later report says that the
wound is healing quite nicely.</i>

1:15:25.723 --> 1:15:28.426
<i>And there is Jimmy Thomas
of Portland, Maine.</i>

1:15:28.459 --> 1:15:31.195
- Jimmy? She said our Jimmy?
- <i>Jimmy is in a camp.</i>

1:15:31.229 --> 1:15:34.365
<i>.and sends his love to
his family on this Christmas.</i>

1:15:34.399 --> 1:15:36.267
<i>He's got a bullet
in his left knee</i>

1:15:36.300 --> 1:15:38.336
<i>which unfortunately
splintered the bone.</i>

1:15:38.369 --> 1:15:41.272
<i>The German doctors
worked on him tirelessly</i>

1:15:41.305 --> 1:15:44.209
<i>and I have to tell you
that Jimmy was just so thankful</i>

1:15:44.243 --> 1:15:45.444
<i>when I saw him.</i>

1:15:45.477 --> 1:15:47.112
<i>He walks with a limp now.</i>

1:15:47.146 --> 1:15:49.481
<i>...but he has his life
and his health.</i>

1:15:49.515 --> 1:15:52.117
Jimmy is alive.

1:15:54.319 --> 1:15:56.989
I just found out
on the Axis Sally show.

1:15:57.022 --> 1:15:58.457
Uh-huh.

1:15:58.490 --> 1:16:01.193
<i>He told me
about films he had seen in America.</i>

1:16:01.226 --> 1:16:04.229
Films which dealt with
the barbarism in Germany,

1:16:04.263 --> 1:16:05.731
and the treatment
which she deals out

1:16:05.764 --> 1:16:08.001
to American prisoners.

1:16:08.034 --> 1:16:11.104
But that wasn't
his experience at all.

1:16:11.137 --> 1:16:14.574
He said he realizes today
that that's only propaganda.

1:16:14.607 --> 1:16:16.543
Men are coming in
by the hundreds.

1:16:16.576 --> 1:16:20.447
These American boys,
day after day,

1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:23.216
they're flying over Europe
in their terror raids

1:16:23.249 --> 1:16:25.718
trying to extinguish
a whole race,

1:16:25.752 --> 1:16:29.322
killing ruthlessly
helpless women and children.

1:16:29.355 --> 1:16:31.992
I ask you, American women,

1:16:32.026 --> 1:16:35.062
if you brought up your boys
to be murderers?

1:16:35.095 --> 1:16:37.765
Because that's what
they are becoming.

1:16:37.798 --> 1:16:41.068
These boys were asked to
sacrifice their youth

1:16:41.101 --> 1:16:44.238
and their future...
and for what?

1:16:45.739 --> 1:16:48.576
Now Midge,
it's Christmas Eve.

1:16:48.609 --> 1:16:52.213
I'm sure there will be a stop
to all the killing for a moment.

1:16:52.246 --> 1:16:54.114
The boys are missing
their families

1:16:54.148 --> 1:16:56.485
and their families
are missing them.

1:16:56.518 --> 1:16:59.020
Why don't we give them
this Christmas song?

1:16:59.054 --> 1:17:00.355

1:18:27.545 --> 1:18:30.648
for more soldiers'
medical reports.

1:18:30.682 --> 1:18:33.586
As you know.
we often have updates.

1:18:35.187 --> 1:18:37.723
Merry Christmas, America.

1:18:37.756 --> 1:18:39.325
From Berlin.

1:18:42.661 --> 1:18:45.297
Would you answer
the question, please?

1:18:45.331 --> 1:18:46.565
You signed
the oath of allegiance

1:18:46.599 --> 1:18:48.167
to save your life,
is that it?

1:18:50.269 --> 1:18:52.738
Yes. I signed the oath
in order to live.

1:18:55.609 --> 1:18:58.879
You said again and again

1:18:58.913 --> 1:19:00.814
that the Allies should
just surrender to Germany.

1:19:02.248 --> 1:19:03.617
Did you think your words
would actually

1:19:03.650 --> 1:19:05.685
cause them to, what?
Just give up?

1:19:05.719 --> 1:19:07.721
It was entertainment.

1:19:07.754 --> 1:19:11.224
We sang songs.
We joked around.

1:19:11.257 --> 1:19:13.293
We tried to make it fun
for the soldiers.

1:19:13.326 --> 1:19:14.628
Oh, fun.

1:19:16.796 --> 1:19:19.500
You sometimes talked about
the girlfriends,

1:19:19.533 --> 1:19:20.936
the wives back in the States

1:19:20.969 --> 1:19:23.471
running around
with the 4-Fs back home.

1:19:23.504 --> 1:19:26.240
Did you think that was entertaining
to the guys on the front lines?

1:19:26.273 --> 1:19:29.477
They knew
I was just clowning around.

1:19:29.510 --> 1:19:31.913
Were you clowning around
in your medical reports

1:19:31.947 --> 1:19:33.447
when you read a mother's name

1:19:33.481 --> 1:19:36.183
and told her that her son
had just died in action?

1:19:37.585 --> 1:19:38.519
No.

1:19:38.552 --> 1:19:40.621
Or when you continued
to tell that mother

1:19:40.655 --> 1:19:43.458
about her son's sufferings
before his death?

1:19:43.492 --> 1:19:44.894
Was that just clowning around?

1:19:44.927 --> 1:19:46.294
You know it wasn't.

1:19:47.562 --> 1:19:50.298
Miss Gillars, as Axis Sally,

1:19:50.332 --> 1:19:52.935
did you really want the
United States to lose the war?

1:19:54.703 --> 1:19:55.737
No.

1:20:03.679 --> 1:20:04.813
Right.

1:20:08.952 --> 1:20:13.222
Were you in love with
Mr. Max Otto Koischwitz?

1:20:16.426 --> 1:20:18.661
That's a personal question.

1:20:18.695 --> 1:20:21.597
It's personal.
Yes, I know.

1:20:21.631 --> 1:20:23.700
But would you answer
my question anyway?

1:20:26.636 --> 1:20:27.905
Yes, I loved him.

1:20:29.973 --> 1:20:32.810
I had known him
when I was a student

1:20:32.843 --> 1:20:35.412
back in Hunter College
in New York City.

1:20:37.715 --> 1:20:40.651
And I reunited with him
in Germany

1:20:40.684 --> 1:20:42.286
when we worked together.

1:20:42.319 --> 1:20:43.922
And did Prof. Koischwitz

1:20:43.955 --> 1:20:46.356
have any influence
on your life?

1:20:47.892 --> 1:20:51.361
I considered him
my destiny.

1:20:51.395 --> 1:20:55.433
What do you mean by that?
Your destiny.

1:20:55.467 --> 1:20:58.803
Without the presence
of Prof. Koischwitz in my life,

1:20:58.837 --> 1:21:00.572
I would not be alive

1:21:00.605 --> 1:21:03.808
and fighting for my life
here today.

1:21:03.842 --> 1:21:08.680
And, I believe that those years
that we had together

1:21:08.713 --> 1:21:11.449
were worth everything.

1:21:11.483 --> 1:21:13.518
Even all the misery
that came later.

1:21:17.822 --> 1:21:19.358
It's your firm belief?

1:21:19.391 --> 1:21:21.494
I loved him
with all my heart,

1:21:22.828 --> 1:21:24.363
and I would do it again.

1:21:36.675 --> 1:21:39.012
Fever is too high.

1:21:39.045 --> 1:21:42.281
The infection has spread
beyond control.

1:21:44.351 --> 1:21:46.921
There's not much we can do
for him anymore at this point.

1:21:49.723 --> 1:21:52.059
Tuberculosis
is very contagious.

1:21:52.093 --> 1:21:54.494
You perhaps should be checked.

1:21:56.130 --> 1:21:57.664
Thank you, Doctor.

1:22:12.747 --> 1:22:17.752
Sweet Max, how will I
ever live without you?

1:22:21.957 --> 1:22:23.391
You're my knight.

1:22:26.094 --> 1:22:30.665
So smart, so sweet,
and always, always

1:22:30.698 --> 1:22:33.569
believed in me, loved me.

1:22:36.172 --> 1:22:38.440
You are the only man
I've ever loved.

1:22:40.442 --> 1:22:42.411
and the only one
who ever loved me.

1:22:42.444 --> 1:22:48.650
I'm sorry.

1:22:49.551 --> 1:22:50.853
Don't be sorry.

1:22:52.155 --> 1:22:55.592
Don't be sorry, Max. Please.

1:23:04.201 --> 1:23:06.536
I love you.

1:23:06.569 --> 1:23:08.771
Always, I love you.

1:23:27.758 --> 1:23:30.828
Good evening, women of America.

1:23:30.861 --> 1:23:35.934
As you know, as time goes on,
I think of you more and more.

1:23:35.967 --> 1:23:39.436
I can't seem to get you
out of my head somehow.

1:23:40.871 --> 1:23:43.608
We can all only hope
for the best from all of this.

1:23:45.777 --> 1:23:50.649
And for the American soldiers,
I hope that my broadcasts

1:23:50.682 --> 1:23:55.922
have somehow brought you
some relief from the war.

1:23:55.955 --> 1:24:02.794
And that wherever you were
in Europe or North America,

1:24:03.996 --> 1:24:07.700
that somehow,
I helped get your mind

1:24:07.733 --> 1:24:10.971
off of the killing,
and made it a little better,

1:24:11.004 --> 1:24:12.705
if only for a few minutes.

1:24:17.077 --> 1:24:18.946
This is my last broadcast.

1:24:22.615 --> 1:24:26.920
and I hope
that you'll be safe and well.

1:25:01.656 --> 1:25:04.159
Oh, your resignation.
Very professional.

1:25:04.193 --> 1:25:05.760
Thank you.

1:25:05.793 --> 1:25:07.595
Who's gonna replace you?

1:25:07.628 --> 1:25:10.165
I don't know.
I'm very hard to replace.

1:25:10.199 --> 1:25:11.233
For sure.

1:25:13.068 --> 1:25:15.870
All right.

1:25:18.107 --> 1:25:19.508
For you.

1:25:22.979 --> 1:25:24.080
Parting gift.

1:25:25.982 --> 1:25:27.917
Be prepared.

1:25:27.951 --> 1:25:29.585
Don't look prepared.

1:25:31.221 --> 1:25:32.755
See?

1:25:32.788 --> 1:25:36.792
Always carry what the
prosecution has against you.

1:25:37.927 --> 1:25:38.928
Let's see.

1:25:42.098 --> 1:25:43.134
Nothing.

1:26:03.087 --> 1:26:04.621
<i>Defense would have you believe</i>

1:26:04.654 --> 1:26:07.591
that Miss Gillars was a victim,

1:26:07.625 --> 1:26:12.130
but the evidence
suggests otherwise.

1:26:12.164 --> 1:26:16.001
Her friends were Nazis,
her fiance was a Nazi,

1:26:16.034 --> 1:26:18.270
everyone around her. Nazis.

1:26:18.303 --> 1:26:20.638
She chose to be there.

1:26:20.671 --> 1:26:22.706
She felt they couldn't lose.

1:26:22.740 --> 1:26:23.741
She was on the right side,

1:26:23.774 --> 1:26:26.744
and all she cared about
was her own ambitions,

1:26:26.777 --> 1:26:29.181
her own selfish fame.

1:26:29.214 --> 1:26:30.681
And as time went on,

1:26:30.714 --> 1:26:34.287
she realized
that she had done wrong.

1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:38.391
So much so,
that when the war was finished,

1:26:38.424 --> 1:26:40.326
she went by a false name

1:26:40.359 --> 1:26:42.295
until we finally
tracked her down.

1:26:42.328 --> 1:26:45.364
Now, is that the behavior
of an innocent victim?

1:26:47.133 --> 1:26:49.768
Or of a lying,
opportunistic traitor?

1:26:55.375 --> 1:26:58.744
What she did was
unnerve our soldiers,

1:26:58.778 --> 1:27:03.183
and brought aid and comfort
to our enemies.

1:27:03.217 --> 1:27:05.785
As far as the Constitution,

1:27:05.818 --> 1:27:08.754
that is the definition
of treason.

1:27:09.957 --> 1:27:13.994
I ask you...
I, uh, I beseech you...

1:27:14.027 --> 1:27:17.830
find that woman guilty
of the heinous crimes

1:27:17.864 --> 1:27:20.902
that she perpetrated
against our great land.

1:27:30.311 --> 1:27:31.312
Okay.

1:27:33.081 --> 1:27:34.215
Yes.

1:27:35.849 --> 1:27:37.285
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1:27:37.318 --> 1:27:42.290
I'm gonna have to apologize
for the vague odor in the room

1:27:42.323 --> 1:27:44.960
that the prosecution left.

1:27:44.994 --> 1:27:47.829
Um, horse manure.
It'll go away.

1:27:50.166 --> 1:27:52.468
I didn't get the laughs
I expected.

1:27:52.501 --> 1:27:54.937
I never do.

1:27:54.970 --> 1:28:00.142
"Anyone who thinks,
must think of entering this war

1:28:00.176 --> 1:28:02.978
as they would of suicide."

1:28:03.012 --> 1:28:05.047
Eleanor Roosevelt said that.

1:28:06.415 --> 1:28:10.987
"Never think that this war,
no matter how justified,

1:28:11.021 --> 1:28:12.989
"is not a crime.

1:28:13.023 --> 1:28:16.126
Never think it's not a crime."

1:28:16.159 --> 1:28:18.962
And that is Ernest Hemingway.

1:28:22.765 --> 1:28:25.834
But neither of them
are being tried for treason.

1:28:25.868 --> 1:28:27.504
Why is that?

1:28:27.537 --> 1:28:32.376
Like Miss Gillars, they opposed
our involvement in the war.

1:28:32.410 --> 1:28:35.745
And like Miss Gillars,
they spoke out about it.

1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:38.216
But unlike Miss Gillars,

1:28:39.984 --> 1:28:42.119
neither of them
had a gun to their head.

1:28:42.153 --> 1:28:44.222
And unlike Miss Gillars,

1:28:44.255 --> 1:28:50.027
their words were not spoon fed
to them by the Nazis.

1:28:50.061 --> 1:28:56.001
Miss Gillars is on trial
for eight counts of treason,

1:28:56.034 --> 1:29:00.138
for reading from a script
she did not write,

1:29:00.172 --> 1:29:04.842
saying words
she did not believe in,

1:29:04.875 --> 1:29:08.146
and being ordered
to say these words

1:29:08.180 --> 1:29:10.182
on penalty of death.

1:29:11.416 --> 1:29:14.785
And now this prosecution
would have her hanged.

1:29:15.853 --> 1:29:21.027
"Congress shall make no law

1:29:21.060 --> 1:29:25.265
abridging
the freedom of speech."

1:29:25.298 --> 1:29:28.834
I've heard that before.
That's the First Amendment.

1:29:31.604 --> 1:29:35.841
Mrs. Roosevelt,
Hemingway and all the others,

1:29:35.874 --> 1:29:37.543
they say what they said,

1:29:37.577 --> 1:29:42.148
and our American laws
protected them.

1:29:42.181 --> 1:29:44.485
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1:29:44.518 --> 1:29:47.121
you must understand.

1:29:47.154 --> 1:29:49.223
America is watching.

1:29:50.057 --> 1:29:54.094
The world is watching us,
all of us.

1:29:54.827 --> 1:29:58.132
If Miss Gillars is found guilty,

1:29:58.165 --> 1:30:02.002
freedom of speech
may no longer be our right.

1:30:02.036 --> 1:30:03.604
It will be a privilege,

1:30:03.637 --> 1:30:09.177
and a privilege can be revoked
at any time, for any reason.

1:30:09.210 --> 1:30:11.913
But let's be honest,
right now,

1:30:11.946 --> 1:30:15.984
Axis Sally was not a person.

1:30:16.884 --> 1:30:20.588
Axis Sally was a persona,

1:30:20.622 --> 1:30:25.627
a character that Miss Gillars
played on a radio show.

1:30:25.660 --> 1:30:27.861
And here's the long
and short of it.

1:30:28.229 --> 1:30:29.397
Nobody died.

1:30:31.600 --> 1:30:36.238
Not a single, solitary
American life was lost

1:30:36.272 --> 1:30:40.309
because of Miss Gillars'
radio broadcast, not one.

1:30:41.410 --> 1:30:42.478
That's a fact.

1:30:43.979 --> 1:30:48.484
On the other hand,
many a worried parent.

1:30:48.517 --> 1:30:53.356
American mothers, fathers.
they all got comfort,

1:30:53.389 --> 1:30:56.126
because they were hearing
about their sons' whereabouts

1:30:56.159 --> 1:30:59.029
through her radio programs.

1:30:59.062 --> 1:31:04.034
Millions listened to each
and every broadcast every week.

1:31:04.067 --> 1:31:08.505
Yet this unjustly maligned
and accused woman

1:31:08.538 --> 1:31:12.676
sits here today,
fighting for her life,

1:31:12.709 --> 1:31:15.512
even though there's not
a single shred of evidence,

1:31:15.545 --> 1:31:19.951
no evidence,
that any of her broadcasts

1:31:19.984 --> 1:31:25.390
were harmful to this country,
or they in some way,

1:31:25.423 --> 1:31:29.927
undermined the morale
of our fighting soldiers.

1:31:29.961 --> 1:31:32.330
Oh, are you kidding?

1:31:32.363 --> 1:31:35.099
Our boys engaged
in the rigors of wars

1:31:35.133 --> 1:31:38.469
are not paying attention
to what Mildred Gillars,

1:31:38.503 --> 1:31:41.139
or Axis Sally,
says over a radio program.

1:31:41.172 --> 1:31:46.278
Some ridiculous song?
Did you hear the song?

1:31:46.311 --> 1:31:48.280
"Germany's beating you"
or something like that,

1:31:48.313 --> 1:31:51.550
whatever it was, something.
it was a silly jingle!

1:31:51.583 --> 1:31:54.386
A slapstick parody!

1:31:54.420 --> 1:31:57.022
Of course, they...
they found it ridiculous.

1:31:58.157 --> 1:31:59.491
They laugh and they mock it,

1:31:59.525 --> 1:32:01.994
and they write home
to their folks saying,

1:32:02.027 --> 1:32:04.329
"Did you hear what Axis Sally
said the other day?"

1:32:04.363 --> 1:32:07.066
Ha-ha-ha, it's a joke.

1:32:07.100 --> 1:32:08.568
You understand?
It's a joke.

1:32:10.703 --> 1:32:13.306
Of course, she did say things
we didn't like.

1:32:13.339 --> 1:32:15.208
Of course, she did.

1:32:15.241 --> 1:32:17.477
But that was the persona.

1:32:17.510 --> 1:32:21.414
That was Axis Sally.
It wasn't Mildred Gillars.

1:32:21.448 --> 1:32:27.387
Don't forget, that was a part
she was forced to play.

1:32:27.420 --> 1:32:31.492
Who is really responsible
for those words?

1:32:31.525 --> 1:32:36.764
It was the ugly propaganda
machine of the Third Reich,

1:32:36.797 --> 1:32:39.099
Goebbels' and Hitler's words,

1:32:39.133 --> 1:32:41.735
not Miss Mildred Gillars' words.
No.

1:32:43.337 --> 1:32:45.072
Let's just stop for a minute.

1:32:47.141 --> 1:32:49.376
And let's just take a look at
what's really going on here.

1:32:51.645 --> 1:32:54.281
Millions of lives were lost.

1:32:55.050 --> 1:32:57.385
Now, I don't know.

1:32:57.419 --> 1:33:01.523
I don't know if you can
win a war that cost so much.

1:33:02.424 --> 1:33:03.525
I don't know.

1:33:03.558 --> 1:33:07.229
But I do know that there isn't
a person in this room

1:33:07.262 --> 1:33:10.665
who wasn't affected
by this war, not a person.

1:33:13.602 --> 1:33:15.036
So what do we do?

1:33:17.439 --> 1:33:19.108
Some lost friends.

1:33:19.842 --> 1:33:22.211
Some lost whole families.

1:33:24.413 --> 1:33:28.184
relatives, brothers, sons.

1:33:31.654 --> 1:33:33.055
My son.

1:33:40.229 --> 1:33:42.098
I'll read this for you.

1:33:43.267 --> 1:33:45.769
"If there is harm.

1:33:49.273 --> 1:33:53.110
"then you shall pay
life for life.

1:33:54.811 --> 1:33:59.249
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for tooth."

1:33:59.283 --> 1:34:01.218
We all know that.
We've heard it before.

1:34:02.252 --> 1:34:04.187
We want justice for this war.

1:34:05.455 --> 1:34:09.127
We want our enemies
to pay dearly

1:34:10.528 --> 1:34:14.132
for what they took from us.

1:34:14.165 --> 1:34:16.801
And we're not wrong
for wanting this.

1:34:16.834 --> 1:34:18.303
But we must pause.

1:34:20.238 --> 1:34:24.576
We must be vigilant
in where we point the finger.

1:34:24.609 --> 1:34:27.745
The woman who sits
in this chair here,

1:34:27.779 --> 1:34:30.549
is not your enemy.

1:34:30.583 --> 1:34:32.618
She never was.

1:34:32.651 --> 1:34:38.557
We cannot let our pain
for our loss, our feelings.

1:34:40.559 --> 1:34:42.828
cloud our judgment.

1:34:42.861 --> 1:34:46.732
Confuse blind justice
with blind vengeance.

1:34:46.765 --> 1:34:52.104
I have to say,
this feels like vengeance.

1:34:54.239 --> 1:35:00.780
We must not sacrifice this woman
at the holy altar of patriotism.

1:35:00.814 --> 1:35:07.687
A patriotism, which very easily
could be covering up a lynch mob!

1:35:12.225 --> 1:35:17.864
Then the tyranny which
we fought against for years

1:35:18.799 --> 1:35:20.501
will become us.

1:35:24.805 --> 1:35:26.207
Mildred Gillars.

1:35:27.675 --> 1:35:30.277
We saw her
during this whole trial.

1:35:30.311 --> 1:35:32.246
We know her.

1:35:32.279 --> 1:35:33.581
We heard her life story.

1:35:33.614 --> 1:35:35.182
We heard the little things
about her,

1:35:35.216 --> 1:35:37.318
the innuendos, et cetera.

1:35:37.351 --> 1:35:40.655
We heard the prosecution
hammering away,

1:35:40.688 --> 1:35:43.358
as he is wont to do.

1:35:43.392 --> 1:35:45.627
Being alone
without a passport,

1:35:45.661 --> 1:35:48.630
foreign country,
no place to go.

1:35:48.664 --> 1:35:52.734
In a war zone, a war zone
that became her life.

1:35:53.769 --> 1:35:54.803
What do you do?

1:35:57.572 --> 1:36:01.376
What happens to someone
who has to live through that?

1:36:04.346 --> 1:36:09.252
Philosophers, psychiatrists,
from Plato to Freud, tell us,

1:36:09.285 --> 1:36:13.423
"Foremost among
our basic human instincts

1:36:13.456 --> 1:36:16.426
is the reflex to survive."

1:36:19.262 --> 1:36:21.764
That's what Mildred Gillars did.

1:36:21.798 --> 1:36:23.633
And that's all she did.

1:36:24.467 --> 1:36:26.569
Survive.

1:36:26.602 --> 1:36:28.571
Let me ask you,
what would you have done?

1:36:29.272 --> 1:36:30.741
Any one of you?

1:36:30.774 --> 1:36:31.976
Think about it.

1:36:32.910 --> 1:36:34.979
If you lived in fear,

1:36:35.013 --> 1:36:39.683
every single moment
of every single day,

1:36:39.717 --> 1:36:42.853
knowing that your life
could end

1:36:42.886 --> 1:36:45.789
with a single bullet
to the head.

1:36:46.857 --> 1:36:48.425
What would you do?

1:36:50.894 --> 1:36:51.930
Or an oven?

1:36:53.731 --> 1:36:56.367
Picture yourself
in that situation.

1:36:56.401 --> 1:36:58.037
Imagine it.

1:36:58.070 --> 1:36:59.939
What would you have done

1:36:59.972 --> 1:37:02.942
with a gun, literally,
to your head?

1:37:02.975 --> 1:37:04.743
What would you have done?

1:37:04.776 --> 1:37:06.611
Because if you think
for one moment

1:37:06.644 --> 1:37:09.848
your choices would have been
different than hers,

1:37:11.382 --> 1:37:15.420
well, I don't think
you'd be breathing right now.

1:37:16.688 --> 1:37:17.957
I just don't.

1:37:20.559 --> 1:37:23.629
Axis Sally, the persona,
is over,

1:37:23.662 --> 1:37:26.832
like the war is over.

1:37:26.866 --> 1:37:33.439
Mildred Gillars, the person,
the human being, is still here.

1:37:33.472 --> 1:37:39.478
A person who managed to beat
unthinkable odds to survive

1:37:39.512 --> 1:37:41.447
is here.

1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:43.784
Give Miss Gillars
her life back,

1:37:43.817 --> 1:37:45.052
her freedom.

1:37:46.053 --> 1:37:47.621
She's an American.

1:37:48.822 --> 1:37:50.423
She always was an American.

1:37:52.726 --> 1:37:54.327
Let's treat her like one.

1:37:56.630 --> 1:37:58.099
We're not going to
kill this woman

1:37:58.132 --> 1:38:02.335
because she managed to
somehow survive, are we?

1:38:03.770 --> 1:38:04.972
Are we going to do that?

1:38:07.909 --> 1:38:09.377
I don't think so.

1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:13.781
Well, I hope not.

1:38:16.851 --> 1:38:18.920
Thank you very much.

1:38:22.824 --> 1:38:23.959
Rest, Your Honor.

1:38:59.429 --> 1:39:00.998
Since I was a little girl.

1:39:03.867 --> 1:39:05.602
I've always known.

1:39:07.437 --> 1:39:10.840
I wasn't the prettiest
or the best.

1:39:16.713 --> 1:39:18.816
Every success I've found,

1:39:20.151 --> 1:39:23.854
I worked for it,
harder than anybody.

1:39:31.196 --> 1:39:32.998
My father was a drunk.

1:39:35.566 --> 1:39:38.402
He abused my mother, then me.

1:39:41.239 --> 1:39:42.107
She left him,

1:39:42.141 --> 1:39:44.576
and married another one
just the same.

1:39:48.180 --> 1:39:50.515
My stepfather
raped me for years.

1:39:54.486 --> 1:39:55.921
I'm so sorry, Mildred.

1:39:59.992 --> 1:40:01.593
I don't need your pity.

1:40:04.263 --> 1:40:07.000
I'm a survivor.

1:40:10.137 --> 1:40:12.471
When you're forced to grow up
that fast, that young,

1:40:12.505 --> 1:40:13.839
you have to be.

1:40:19.079 --> 1:40:22.548
Men have taken advantage of me
my whole life.

1:40:25.551 --> 1:40:26.786
But not Max.

1:40:33.894 --> 1:40:35.595
I'm damaged goods.

1:40:41.835 --> 1:40:44.738
But he...

1:40:46.707 --> 1:40:48.709
<i>He told me
I had what it takes.</i>

1:40:54.984 --> 1:40:56.952
<i>And to hear people
talk about him</i>

1:40:56.986 --> 1:40:58.988
<i>like he was
some horrible person,</i>

1:41:01.056 --> 1:41:02.890
<i>it breaks my heart.</i>

1:41:12.034 --> 1:41:13.701
I loved him.

1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:22.878
When he died.
a part of me died with him.

1:41:51.042 --> 1:41:52.842
Mr. Foreman,

1:41:52.876 --> 1:41:54.311
has the jury
agreed upon a verdict

1:41:54.345 --> 1:41:56.180
on each of the eight counts?

1:41:56.213 --> 1:41:57.814
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1:41:57.847 --> 1:41:59.682
Will the defendant please rise?

1:42:06.191 --> 1:42:07.892
What say you?

1:42:07.925 --> 1:42:10.362
On count one, we the jury,

1:42:10.395 --> 1:42:13.764
find the defendant,
Mildred Gillars...

1:42:19.237 --> 1:42:20.738
not guilty.

1:42:25.776 --> 1:42:28.712
On count...

1:42:28.746 --> 1:42:30.183
Order in this court.

1:42:33.685 --> 1:42:34.954
Please continue.

1:42:34.987 --> 1:42:37.789
Count two, not guilty.

1:42:38.424 --> 1:42:42.128
Count three, not guilty.

1:42:42.161 --> 1:42:45.264
Count four, not guilty.

1:42:45.298 --> 1:42:48.234
Count five, not guilty.

1:42:48.267 --> 1:42:50.769
Count six, not guilty.

1:42:50.802 --> 1:42:53.805
Count seven, not guilty.

1:42:53.839 --> 1:42:56.376
And on count eight,
involving her part

1:42:56.410 --> 1:42:58.878
in the German propaganda
broadcast of the radio play

1:42:58.911 --> 1:43:00.347
<i>Vision of Invasion,</i>

1:43:00.380 --> 1:43:02.983
we the jury find her
guilty as charged.

1:43:25.706 --> 1:43:27.075
<i>Grounder.</i>

1:43:27.108 --> 1:43:28.376
I believe that's what
you called it?

1:43:30.011 --> 1:43:32.080
Well, it was
a hard-hit ball,

1:43:32.113 --> 1:43:33.881
but it was an easy out.

1:43:33.914 --> 1:43:35.682
Our British friends
hung their Axis Sally

1:43:35.716 --> 1:43:37.152
and the trial took three days.

1:43:38.353 --> 1:43:39.853
Good for them,

1:43:39.887 --> 1:43:42.057
but the powers that be
told me I should, you know,

1:43:42.091 --> 1:43:44.160
make it look good.

1:43:44.193 --> 1:43:46.195
You got a conviction.

1:43:46.228 --> 1:43:48.197
She got 30 years. You won.

1:43:48.230 --> 1:43:50.065
Pretty good, no?

1:43:50.099 --> 1:43:54.203
You have another case,
Herbert John Burgman.

1:43:54.236 --> 1:43:55.904
Broadcaster.

1:43:55.937 --> 1:43:57.739
Sixty-nine counts of treason.
You're going to Berlin.

1:44:00.075 --> 1:44:01.210
Well, that's fine.

1:44:02.411 --> 1:44:04.213
Goodbye, Mr. Laughlin.

1:44:04.246 --> 1:44:06.849
Yeah, for now.

1:44:07.350 --> 1:44:08.418
No?

1:44:11.488 --> 1:44:12.922
All right.

1:44:18.461 --> 1:44:20.729
Oh, man.

1:44:45.423 --> 1:44:47.992
When I got this idea

1:44:48.025 --> 1:44:51.028
of trying to contact
this very famous lawyer

1:44:51.062 --> 1:44:53.931
that I'd been reading about
in the newspaper,

1:44:53.966 --> 1:44:56.401
who was defending Axis Sally,

1:44:56.435 --> 1:44:58.869
he doesn't pay
any attention to me.

1:44:58.903 --> 1:45:01.806
And then a little later,
he comes over and says,

1:45:01.839 --> 1:45:04.476
"Can you be at the courthouse
at 9:30 in the morning?"

1:45:06.044 --> 1:45:07.812
I said, "Sure I can."

1:45:07.845 --> 1:45:11.350
And he sits me down
in the counsel table

1:45:11.383 --> 1:45:13.518
in this most famous trial.

1:45:13.552 --> 1:45:15.920
I'd never been
in a courtroom before.
