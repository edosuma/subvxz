01:55.700 --> 01:56.743
This is good for...

01:56.826 --> 01:58.203
- Hi, Father.
- One, please.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.412
$10, please.

01:59.496 --> 02:01.337
- Did you send the labels?
- Every one, $3,000.

02:01.873 --> 02:02.999
Hello, how many?

02:03.666 --> 02:04.876
Here's my bank.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.213
Back in 20 minutes.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.548
Yeah, the rush is about to hit.

02:27.148 --> 02:30.819
<i>Some of the donors that have
given graciously thus far...</i>

02:38.868 --> 02:40.662
<i>Move over, Fred and Ginger.</i>

02:40.745 --> 02:44.582
<i>Contestant number four, Audrey Clark,
has been tap dancing</i>

02:44.666 --> 02:46.876
<i>since she was three years old.</i>

02:46.960 --> 02:50.129
<i>Pickaway County
has delighted in Audrey's performances</i>

02:50.213 --> 02:52.173
<i>for 16 years and counting.</i>

02:52.257 --> 02:53.758
<i>Don't worry, dance fans...</i>

03:12.402 --> 03:13.611
Smile!

03:24.581 --> 03:26.124
Come on, Mommy!

03:26.499 --> 03:28.543
One more time, Mom. One more time.

03:28.793 --> 03:31.588
Here you go. It's all you, it's all you.

03:39.971 --> 03:41.931
Heads up, here they are.

04:26.184 --> 04:27.602
All right, try again one more time.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.354
- I know it's in you. Come on.
- No, no.

04:29.479 --> 04:31.159
- Come on, Mommy!
- Come on, one more time.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.359
Hey, Padre. Padre.

04:34.692 --> 04:37.195
Come on in here, help this
little girl out here.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.906
- I don't think so.
- Hey, no cash, no nuns, on the house.

04:40.073 --> 04:41.783
Come on, for this beautiful little girl.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.201
- Please.
- You can do it.

04:43.660 --> 04:47.080
Come on. On the house.
Pop three for her. There you go.

04:47.664 --> 04:49.165
- Who wants to be next here?
- Yeah!

04:49.248 --> 04:51.334
Look at that. It's so
easy, he can even do it.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.378
- Mommy, I won!
- Got a winner!

04:53.461 --> 04:54.879
Little girl's a winner!

04:54.963 --> 04:56.047
- Here you go.
- I won!

05:07.558 --> 05:10.395
Here you go, Padre, it's all you.
You're a winner.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.146
- Big old winner.
- Thank you.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.398
Thank you, Father.

05:13.898 --> 05:15.900
There's the big winner!

05:26.119 --> 05:27.245
Hardwicke!

05:27.745 --> 05:28.788
Hey!

05:48.808 --> 05:51.185
I got it. Keep it quiet.

06:04.449 --> 06:06.534
How ya doin', Officer?
I just gotta get through here real quick.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.453
Sorry, sir, livestock shows are changing.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.746
You're gonna have to wait 20 minutes.

06:09.829 --> 06:11.706
Come on. I'm not gonna
say anything if you don't say anything.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.124
No, sir. Those are the rules.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.542
Idiot.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.045
- These are stacks of hundreds right here.
- Easy.

06:17.128 --> 06:18.713
I've already counted them twice.
They're good.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.798
- Good deal.
- Pass me more bands.

06:21.049 --> 06:23.509
Hardwicke's torching the hay bales
in five minutes.

06:23.593 --> 06:25.136
Wait for my call.

06:26.054 --> 06:27.305
$20 bands, please.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.891
Let's move this in because
we got another shipment coming in...

06:29.974 --> 06:32.810
Bet it's gonna be
over 100 degrees again today.

06:33.102 --> 06:36.230
Rankin, grab me a lemon shake-up
on your next run?

06:46.532 --> 06:47.617
This is gonna be fun.

06:47.992 --> 06:49.243
My uncle was a priest.

06:52.997 --> 06:54.123
Sorry to bother you.

06:54.207 --> 06:55.833
I'm on a bus back to Cleveland at 4:00.

06:56.709 --> 06:57.794
I was wondering if there's someplace

06:57.877 --> 06:59.796
I could put this while I walk around.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.214
Sure, Father.

07:01.297 --> 07:04.458
Right where you came in, there's a blue
building. That's the hospitality center.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.677
They will be more than happy to help you
with whatever you need.

07:06.761 --> 07:08.346
They got some great refreshments there.

07:08.638 --> 07:10.264
- Go! Go!
- Freeze!

07:14.977 --> 07:15.978
Drop it.

07:17.146 --> 07:18.147
Let's go.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.360
Everybody down!

07:22.443 --> 07:24.445
Get down in front of the table! Asses up!

07:24.612 --> 07:26.072
I'll blow your fucking brains out!

07:26.155 --> 07:27.156
Move it!

07:28.950 --> 07:30.910
- What's the erase code?
- 487.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.037
Type it m.

07:34.205 --> 07:35.540
Let's go. Move.

07:39.377 --> 07:41.379
On the floor, face down.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.881
I need your phones
in a pile over here, please.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.551
Right up here, like the good Father said.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.594
- Pass them up there.
- Hurry! Up here!

07:54.392 --> 07:55.977
Sopranos, you're flat,

07:56.060 --> 07:58.271
you've gotta reach for those high notes.

08:01.983 --> 08:04.485
We all want this over
as quickly as possible.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.738
I don't steal from people
who can't afford it

08:08.406 --> 08:11.075
and I don't hurt people
that don't deserve it. So relax.

08:12.410 --> 08:14.287
I'm no better than you.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.746
You're no better than me.

08:15.830 --> 08:18.082
If I say I'll do something, I'll do it.

08:18.166 --> 08:21.085
If you say you'll do
something and you don't,

08:21.586 --> 08:22.795
I'll make sure you regret it.

08:42.607 --> 08:45.985
We don't have the keys to that cabinet.
Only Mr. Leeds has those keys.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.153
Shut it, old man.

08:47.236 --> 08:50.072
Hands behind your back.
Everyone! Hands behind the back!

08:54.368 --> 08:56.287
- Stay down, Ben!
- Back down, sailor!

08:56.537 --> 08:59.207
I make minimum wage, please! I'm nobody!

08:59.290 --> 09:02.043
I don't wanna... Please!
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!

09:02.168 --> 09:04.378
Shut your cocksucker
or I'll blow your head off.

09:05.630 --> 09:07.798
Hey, I'll take care of this.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.886
Tie him up.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.137
Calm down, calm down.

09:14.472 --> 09:15.973
Take it easy.

09:17.642 --> 09:19.101
Take it easy.

09:19.310 --> 09:22.480
It's okay. Everything's gonna be just fine.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.608
I promise.

09:29.695 --> 09:30.821
What's your name?

09:30.905 --> 09:31.989
Ben.

09:32.448 --> 09:33.658
You got a girlfriend, Ben?

09:36.202 --> 09:37.995
She loves you, right?

09:38.871 --> 09:40.498
What's her name?

09:40.998 --> 09:42.416
It's Hannah.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.337
Tonight you're gonna be
sitting with your arm around Hannah,

09:46.420 --> 09:48.506
watching this on the 10:00 news.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.541
She'll be so close,
you'll feel her breath on your neck.

09:52.593 --> 09:56.430
And when she hears how nobody got hurt
today because of your cool head

09:56.514 --> 09:59.850
she's gonna press
her warm hand against your cheek.

10:01.936 --> 10:04.230
She's gonna look into your eyes

10:04.814 --> 10:07.233
like there's no place else
she ever wants to look again.

10:08.067 --> 10:10.903
Trust me, Ben. It's gonna be a good night.

10:12.530 --> 10:14.365
Thank... Thank you, Father.

10:15.074 --> 10:16.534
On the floor.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.954
Hands behind your back.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.464
Okay, let's get in.

10:30.548 --> 10:34.552
That partner of yours better be right
about what's inside these tin cans.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.973
Hurry up before he drinks it all.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.767
You're right. We should have left earlier.

10:41.851 --> 10:43.978
Hey. You look beautiful, Claire.

10:44.061 --> 10:46.480
I bet you say that to all the girls.

10:46.564 --> 10:48.357
You know you're the only one.

10:48.441 --> 10:49.942
What about your partner?

10:50.026 --> 10:51.319
Come on, your dad's important to me.

10:51.402 --> 10:54.155
I know it. I love that you love him.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.744
Hurley! 'Hey, Dad!

10:59.869 --> 11:01.412
You think, and you'll...

11:01.829 --> 11:04.332
- Hey! Howard, excuse me a second.
- Sure, sure.

11:04.415 --> 11:06.167
There's my little girl.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.753
Claire, who's this bum you brought?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.755
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hi, Daddy.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.090
- I'm going to find Jen.
- Good. Go see her.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.677
It's so good to see you, man.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.179
You too, Hurley.

11:19.764 --> 11:21.891
Okay. One down, one to go.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.020
- How's it look?
- What do we got?

11:26.937 --> 11:28.522
Full. Totally full.

11:33.277 --> 11:35.196
Ching, ching, baby.

11:38.240 --> 11:42.912
I got everything from a guy who's worked
this fair for the last eight years.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.873
Blueprints, everything you need.

11:46.957 --> 11:50.795
They rake in a big haul
on Saturday and Sunday.

11:51.462 --> 11:54.548
One, one-and-a-half million. Not bad?

11:55.132 --> 11:56.884
So you think I need those guys.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.261
Yeah. It's a five-man job.

12:00.429 --> 12:02.848
How do you know this guy, Melander?

12:05.142 --> 12:09.688
Melander and I worked together
out in Portland, 20 years back.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.109
Always had a good crew.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.237
Independent, like us.

12:16.362 --> 12:17.780
I told him right off,

12:18.572 --> 12:23.411
if you were in, it's your show.
You're in charge.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.207
Number two, good to go.

12:50.146 --> 12:52.106
- Let's go.
- What the fuck was that?

12:52.189 --> 12:53.816
Just stay with the plan. Move it.

13:27.183 --> 13:29.310
It's total fucking panic out here!

13:42.198 --> 13:43.240
Here.

13:47.328 --> 13:49.246
All right. Down on the floor.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.090
Stay out of sight. We're
going out the back.

14:09.683 --> 14:10.935
So, we all good?

14:11.060 --> 14:12.728
You were supposed to torch the hay bales

14:12.811 --> 14:15.022
behind the livestock pavilion,
away from the midway.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.899
You know what?
There was some trouble, so I improvised.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.317
Big fuckin' deal...

14:18.400 --> 14:21.195
Someone gets hurt, cops come after us.
That's the big fucking deal!

14:21.278 --> 14:22.363
Motherfucker!

14:22.446 --> 14:24.365
I said behind the livestock pavilion.

14:30.538 --> 14:32.039
Thirty seconds.

14:40.339 --> 14:42.258
Come on! I'm rolling! Right now!

15:06.198 --> 15:09.410
I gotta say, Parker, you
came as advertised.

15:11.078 --> 15:14.456
So, I've decided
to bring you in on something else.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.334
Something big.

15:18.252 --> 15:21.672
Look, 200 grand each
isn't gonna make any of us rich.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.174
But if we all kick in
our share as seed money

15:24.258 --> 15:27.428
towards the next little
piece of business down the line,

15:27.511 --> 15:30.556
we all end up with two million. Each.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.266
We just took a million bucks.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.018
That's a hell of a lot of seed.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.769
And that's just for the house.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.441
I don't think so.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.986
Look. Picture one of those duffel bags,

15:44.069 --> 15:45.946
only instead of tens and twenties,

15:46.030 --> 15:47.531
it's filled with diamonds and pearls.

15:48.407 --> 15:51.243
Jewelry's 10 cents on the dollar.
No, thanks.

15:51.327 --> 15:54.246
No, not 10 cents. I'm getting 20.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.458
Parker, two million each.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.294
We've got someone on the inside.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.380
It's the score of a lifetime. Guaranteed.

16:05.215 --> 16:08.802
We made a deal. You said we'd split the take.
That's what we need to do.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.431
Why don't you think about it?

16:12.640 --> 16:14.308
Come on. Parker, hey.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.560
We're talking millions. Seriously.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.705
Okay, Parker, cards on the table.

16:36.789 --> 16:38.789
I'm gonna need
the whole score for this next thing.

16:38.999 --> 16:42.711
So, if you were me,
what would you do with a guy like you?

16:43.796 --> 16:46.256
Divide up the shares
and that'd be the end of it.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.425
What if you decided not to do that?

16:49.426 --> 16:51.762
I'd kill him While I had the chance.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.270
Jesus Christ.

17:02.773 --> 17:03.941
Shit.

17:13.534 --> 17:14.785
Watch it!

17:23.292 --> 17:24.420
Grab him!

17:26.505 --> 17:27.589
Shoot him!

17:28.048 --> 17:29.425
My God!

17:29.633 --> 17:30.926
Grab the gun!

17:37.558 --> 17:38.600
Grab it!

17:39.143 --> 17:40.227
Shit!

17:43.021 --> 17:44.064
Damn!

17:46.525 --> 17:47.985
Stop him!

17:56.201 --> 17:57.536
Son of a bitch!

17:57.619 --> 17:59.739
- My nose! He broke my nose!
- Let me see, let me see!

18:00.956 --> 18:03.208
What kind of an idiot
fires a shotgun in a fucking car!

18:03.292 --> 18:05.335
- Shut up, Hardwicke!
- My God!

18:05.669 --> 18:07.504
- Shut up!
- I'm bleedin', man!

18:08.422 --> 18:09.465
Stop this blood.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.341
- Go finish him.
- Wait, wait, wait.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.136
Look. He's fucking dead.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.013
Let's just get the fuck out of here!

18:16.096 --> 18:18.348
I don't give a fuck who your uncle is!

18:18.432 --> 18:20.893
Now, you wanna be a part of this,
you go finish him.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.603
You heard him, Hardwicke! Go!

18:22.686 --> 18:24.646
- Go do it!
- Get the fuck out of here!

18:25.647 --> 18:27.858
God, I gotta get out of here!

18:29.359 --> 18:32.237
- Handle your business!
- Come on! I gotta go!

18:32.362 --> 18:35.199
Do it! Blow his fucking head off!

18:45.918 --> 18:47.211
Fuck. Fuck.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.674
You got to fucking bend sometimes, Parker!

18:52.883 --> 18:54.343
You're so fucking stupid!

18:54.968 --> 18:56.136
Do it!

18:57.554 --> 18:59.034
- Come on!
- Good. Let's go, let's go!

19:12.236 --> 19:16.156
<i>I didn't get a good look at his face,
just that he was a priest.</i>

19:16.240 --> 19:20.577
<i>So far as his build or that goes, I don't know.
I guess I'd say average.</i>

19:21.745 --> 19:23.872
<i>Did he say anything to you?</i>

19:25.374 --> 19:28.168
<i>Not really. Nope.</i>

19:30.504 --> 19:32.297
That looks like a man's shoe up there.

19:32.381 --> 19:33.632
That looks like blood.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.259
Hey, Eddie! Look at that!

19:35.759 --> 19:37.761
James, stop! There's a man!

19:37.845 --> 19:39.888
Boys, stay in the truck.

19:39.972 --> 19:42.057
- You think he's dead?
- I don't know.

19:42.808 --> 19:45.644
You boys hang back. I'm going to check it.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.188
Sweet Jesus. Come on.

19:48.313 --> 19:50.858
What do you want us to do, Daddy?

19:50.941 --> 19:52.067
He's alive.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.611
- Take him on the other side, here.
- Okay.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.531
Get him over. Come on, now.

19:57.614 --> 19:58.907
Get him out. Let's go.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.451
Wait, wait! Support him.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.371
How you all doing, boys?

20:13.630 --> 20:15.507
Wanna get my back?

20:22.431 --> 20:23.974
Too many scars.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.560
If you came into the ER
with this many holes,

20:26.643 --> 20:28.770
we'd be prepping you for the morgue.

20:28.854 --> 20:31.440
That's why I stay away from hospitals.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.119
Stay still.

20:44.745 --> 20:46.622
We're going to get you to the hospital.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.498
We gotcha.

21:01.345 --> 21:03.138
<i>That's right. Nicely done, Benjamin.</i>

21:03.221 --> 21:05.432
<i>Well, a silver Suburban used by the thieves</i>

21:05.515 --> 21:07.893
<i>who struck the neighboring
Ohio State Fair on Monday</i>

21:07.976 --> 21:11.188
<i>was found in a strip mall
across the state in Cincinnati, Ohio.</i>

21:11.271 --> 21:14.441
<i>Now, the men made off
with approximately one million dollars</i>

21:14.524 --> 21:17.486
<i>and are believed to have set a deadly fire
while making their escape.</i>

21:17.569 --> 21:20.656
<i>A 51-year-old
Sedalia resident, Charles Stockton</i>

21:20.739 --> 21:23.367
<i>was killed in that blaze
that injured six others.</i>

21:29.122 --> 21:31.625
<i>Anyone with information
is asked to call Crime Stoppers...</i>

21:31.708 --> 21:33.168
<i>Don't get up.</i>

21:33.752 --> 21:35.253
<i>You were shot.</i>

21:36.546 --> 21:37.589
<i>I'll call the nurse.</i>

21:38.465 --> 21:39.633
Don't you call the nurse.

21:43.804 --> 21:44.888
Where am I?

21:45.889 --> 21:47.683
<i>Covington, Kentucky.</i>

21:47.891 --> 21:50.060
<i>You know... Do you know
what happened to you?</i>

21:50.143 --> 21:51.383
<i>They don't even know your name.</i>

21:55.399 --> 21:56.650
<i>Hey. HEY-</i>

21:57.734 --> 21:59.027
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

21:59.111 --> 22:01.029
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

22:01.279 --> 22:03.281
- How are you today?
- Doing good.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.242
Okay, Mr. Quinn!

22:05.325 --> 22:06.451
Radiation's all set for you.

22:06.785 --> 22:09.204
<i>Help the man. This man needs some help.</i>

22:09.287 --> 22:11.873
Okay, okay, no problem. Let me get you set

22:11.957 --> 22:13.837
<i>- and</i> I'll check him <i>out.
- This man needs help.</i>

22:13.917 --> 22:16.378
Come on. Get up, get up.
You know the drill. Let's go.

22:16.461 --> 22:19.172
<i>- Help</i> the man.
- Okay. We have to get to Radiation.

22:19.923 --> 22:21.133
<i>- Needs some help.</i>
- Pick your <i>feet up.</i>

22:21.216 --> 22:22.259
Calm down, calm down.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.683
<i>Nurse!</i>

22:32.102 --> 22:33.603
<i>Don't hurt him.</i>

22:35.105 --> 22:37.691
<i>Please... Please don't.
Please don't hurt him.</i>

22:37.774 --> 22:38.942
<i>Please.</i>

22:39.443 --> 22:40.777
<i>My God.</i>

22:42.654 --> 22:44.031
<i>Is he dead?</i>

22:44.948 --> 22:47.367
<i>He's dead. You killed him.</i>

22:47.492 --> 22:48.535
No.

22:50.787 --> 22:51.955
<i>Praise the Lord.</i>

22:53.707 --> 22:56.126
<i>What's... What's going to happen now?</i>

22:57.085 --> 22:59.296
<i>Please don't hurt me. Please.</i>

23:13.435 --> 23:14.811
Ain't no wallet, no ID on him.

23:14.895 --> 23:16.456
You said he was shot two times, though?

23:16.480 --> 23:18.565
Yeah. Found at the side of the road,
left for dead.

23:18.648 --> 23:20.233
How long was he in surgery?

23:20.317 --> 23:22.736
I need you in the chair
to hold up my weight.

23:22.819 --> 23:26.656
Don't call attention to us and I'll let you
go as soon as we're outside, understand?

23:26.907 --> 23:28.492
Is he talking?

23:28.575 --> 23:30.535
No, I believe he's still unconscious.

23:30.619 --> 23:31.953
Yeah, a farmer found him.

23:39.836 --> 23:40.921
We'll get you inside now.

23:54.017 --> 23:56.103
Hey. Feel better.

24:00.524 --> 24:01.733
<i>You too.</i>

24:44.776 --> 24:46.695
<i>Blow his fucking head off!</i>

24:48.488 --> 24:49.573
Do it!

25:01.168 --> 25:02.419
I got it!

25:02.502 --> 25:04.004
Get your ass in the truck.

25:04.087 --> 25:07.090
Ain't going to be no ducks left.
I'm about to leave you.

26:11.947 --> 26:14.658
Mr. Norte, I'm a friend of Bob Hurley's.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.826
Yeah. Listen, I need some documents.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.914
Don't worry about the money.

26:20.997 --> 26:23.375
I start a new job in the morning.

26:47.357 --> 26:50.068
- Don't cash your check when she's around.
- Be back at 1830.

26:50.485 --> 26:51.725
All right, we'll see you later.

27:02.038 --> 27:04.541
Do what I say and you won't get hurt.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.376
Mine's bigger than yours.

27:11.214 --> 27:13.633
It's not the size, it's how you use it.

27:14.509 --> 27:15.885
What the hell?

27:16.177 --> 27:18.018
You got hurt because
you didn't do what I said.

27:18.555 --> 27:20.356
Your bulletproof vest
doesn't cover your legs.

27:20.390 --> 27:21.725
Next time I'll take out your eye.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.226
Who the fuck are you?

27:23.435 --> 27:25.875
Do right, in a few minutes
you're on your way to the hospital.

27:27.564 --> 27:28.964
- They'll get you, you know.
- Yeah.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.150
So don't sweat it.

27:30.233 --> 27:33.028
It's only money, you're insured,
and they'll get me. Get up.

27:36.906 --> 27:38.700
Remember I got a gun on you.

27:38.783 --> 27:39.909
What's your name?

27:40.160 --> 27:42.412
Jack. People call me Jack.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.331
Move it, Jack.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.082
What's your partner's name?

27:46.583 --> 27:47.751
Oliver.

27:48.793 --> 27:52.047
You say, "Oliver, I got shot.
This guy helped me." Nothing else.

28:08.772 --> 28:12.150
I got shot.
Thank God this guy helped me. Jesus.

28:15.070 --> 28:16.613
It's small but it hurts.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.977
He knows we're wearing vests.
He'll shoot you in the face.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.243
Can we get this over with
so I can go to a goddamn hospital?

28:24.621 --> 28:27.040
Okay, Oliver.
Help Jack get into the other room.

28:27.165 --> 28:28.333
I need cash.

28:30.293 --> 28:31.894
You know they're gonna get you for this.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.130
Yeah, Jack already told me.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.218
Sorry about the leg, Jack.

28:38.301 --> 28:40.821
You sit tight for five minutes,
I'm gonna call you an ambulance.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.837
<i>Hey! Come on in, seÃ±or.</i>

29:14.129 --> 29:15.839
You made it in record time.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.174
So you're Hurley's friend.

29:18.383 --> 29:20.510
I'm glad you found us, Mr...

29:23.680 --> 29:25.640
Well, step right this way.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.494
You know, this was my daddy's business.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.604
We make most of our money
off the high schools.

29:31.688 --> 29:34.858
You know, printing yearbooks, diplomas...
Stuff like that.

29:35.483 --> 29:38.111
I need to be able to buy a car, get a loan.

29:38.194 --> 29:41.197
Name, birth certificate, driver's license.
Social.

29:42.699 --> 29:44.659
Passport? Anything else?

29:47.078 --> 29:48.872
Did you bring a picture?

29:49.664 --> 29:50.707
No.

29:54.502 --> 29:55.879
Ernesto...

29:57.964 --> 29:59.048
Five days, my friend.

30:02.302 --> 30:05.388
Come on through. You're out. Go. Move.

30:08.308 --> 30:09.476
Hello?

30:10.685 --> 30:12.061
It's Parker.

30:13.188 --> 30:14.230
Yeah?

30:15.732 --> 30:17.108
There was a problem with the job.

30:19.527 --> 30:21.154
I need you to do two things for me.

30:21.362 --> 30:22.572
Yeah. Name it.

30:22.906 --> 30:25.658
First, let Claire know
I'll be gone longer than I thought.

30:25.742 --> 30:26.784
<i>All right. You got it.</i>

30:27.785 --> 30:30.345
Second, you know where
I can get a hold of that client, Melander?

30:30.413 --> 30:31.581
What happened?

30:31.915 --> 30:33.958
I invoiced, but I wasn't able to collect.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.919
Jesus, Parker.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.713
Are you all right?

30:40.590 --> 30:41.716
Where is he?

30:42.926 --> 30:44.469
This is not a good idea.

30:45.178 --> 30:48.014
<i>After you didn't call I did some checking.</i>

30:48.097 --> 30:52.519
<i>It turns out that Melander
is not as independent as I thought.</i>

30:52.977 --> 30:56.814
He's got connections. Big connections.
We're talking Chicago.

30:57.482 --> 30:58.816
Danzinger.

30:59.651 --> 31:01.611
So don't start anything.

31:02.153 --> 31:03.780
Hurley, it's me.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.823
- Give <i>me</i> a <i>name.
- Listen.</i>

31:08.326 --> 31:12.372
Hardwicke is a nephew of Danzinger.

31:12.956 --> 31:14.999
- You understand?
- Give me a name!

31:17.126 --> 31:18.795
Jesus Christ.

31:19.504 --> 31:21.172
All right, here's what I got.

31:21.464 --> 31:23.174
<i>His brother, Bobby Hardwicke,</i>

31:23.258 --> 31:25.885
<i>owns five bars on Bourbon Street.</i>

31:26.344 --> 31:28.388
Plus a rock 'n' roll club.

31:28.471 --> 31:30.306
Now, listen, you be real careful.

31:30.807 --> 31:32.642
<i>These are bad guys.</i>

32:15.560 --> 32:16.769
- Trying to get in?
- Yeah.

32:16.853 --> 32:18.605
All right, go ahead.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.399
I need to see Bobby Hardwicke.

32:21.482 --> 32:22.525
Not going to happen-

32:23.693 --> 32:25.695
Tell him Mr. Danzinger sent me.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.657
Wait here.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.498
Idiot. Get out!

32:41.878 --> 32:44.964
I got 300 people down there and you're
telling me you only got 200 pays.

32:45.048 --> 32:47.592
That means I got 100 fucking guests.

32:47.759 --> 32:49.218
Who are these fucking guests?

32:49.302 --> 32:51.804
- Relax, Bobby...
- Now don't tell me to relax, you understand?

32:51.888 --> 32:53.723
- What?
- Bobby Hardwicke?

32:54.891 --> 32:55.892
Out. Private.

32:57.226 --> 32:58.986
I need you to tell me
where your brother is.

32:59.729 --> 33:01.890
- Get him the fuck out of here.
- Come on, you heard...

33:03.483 --> 33:04.901
You son of a...

33:13.743 --> 33:16.162
Your brother went off on a job
with a man named Melander.

33:17.914 --> 33:20.958
Do you know
how fucking connected I am, chief?

33:21.084 --> 33:22.543
They took money that belongs to me.

33:22.627 --> 33:24.253
Tell me where they are
and I'll get out of your hair.

33:24.337 --> 33:25.630
Do you have any concept

33:25.755 --> 33:30.093
of the unholy shitstorm you're about to
unleash by fucking with me? Do you?

33:34.889 --> 33:37.600
First I should tell you,
when I say I'll do something,

33:37.684 --> 33:39.060
I always follow through. Always.

33:40.895 --> 33:42.146
FUCK you!

33:42.230 --> 33:44.524
If you don't tell me what I need to know

33:44.607 --> 33:47.652
I'm going to press down on this chair
until it crushes your trachea.

33:47.735 --> 33:49.821
Trust me, it's agonizing.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.699
Plus, there's the posthumous humiliation

33:52.782 --> 33:54.534
of having been killed with a chair.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.206
Florida.

34:00.540 --> 34:01.916
Joey? Joey?

34:02.291 --> 34:03.626
Holy shit.

34:06.462 --> 34:07.714
Where in Florida?

34:07.797 --> 34:09.257
Palm Beach!

34:11.092 --> 34:12.635
Palm Beach, for Christ's sake!

34:12.719 --> 34:14.094
Bobby!

34:16.806 --> 34:18.933
- Jesus! You okay?
- Fucking get him!

34:19.851 --> 34:21.226
Get him!

34:54.092 --> 34:55.636
<i>Hi. You know what to do.</i>

34:56.929 --> 35:00.057
Claire. Claire, I wish
you'd keep that thing on.

35:00.725 --> 35:02.435
Look. Trouble might find its way up there.

35:02.518 --> 35:05.021
I think you'd better
talk to a travel agent.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.355
Tomorrow.

35:21.662 --> 35:22.663
Yeah?

35:22.747 --> 35:24.832
Hurley. Time for a vacation.

35:28.711 --> 35:29.879
Yeah.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.563
<i>Here's your Mighty 690 forecast, folks,</i>

35:47.647 --> 35:49.315
<i>and let me tell you Palm Beach weather,</i>

35:49.398 --> 35:51.776
<i>it's just unbelievable this time of year.</i>

35:51.859 --> 35:53.486
<i>The temperature drops to 50</i>

35:53.569 --> 35:56.239
<i>and everybody's wearing
boots, sweaters, and leather jackets.</i>

35:56.322 --> 35:57.907
<i>Then, poof, the next day it's</i> 85

35:57.990 --> 36:00.785
<i>and we're back in flip-flops,
halter-tops, and board shorts.</i>

36:00.910 --> 36:02.390
<i>There's nothing between Sherri and...</i>

36:02.453 --> 36:03.704
<i>God!</i>

36:05.915 --> 36:07.917
<i>There will always</i>

36:09.043 --> 36:11.587
<i>be something between you and Sherri.</i>

36:13.089 --> 36:14.257
<i>Always.</i>

36:16.092 --> 36:18.511
You're not going to wear that skirt!

36:18.594 --> 36:20.930
You know we can't wear earth tones!

36:21.013 --> 36:22.431
It's Tahari.

36:23.182 --> 36:25.434
That's what's important. Not your hips.

36:26.143 --> 36:27.854
It's what they expect me to wear, Ma.

36:27.937 --> 36:30.857
They tell you what to wear, what to drive.
You can't afford it.

36:30.940 --> 36:33.442
You know I'm not loaning you
any more money, right?

36:34.443 --> 36:36.362
Can you open my pills? My hands are bad.

36:36.445 --> 36:37.530
I put them out.

36:37.613 --> 36:39.031
At least take Pipsy out.

36:44.287 --> 36:45.371
Leslie!

36:45.454 --> 36:47.790
- It's your dog.
- And it's my house!

36:47.874 --> 36:49.500
It's a condo, Ma.

36:52.044 --> 36:54.547
I put one of these devices in each speaker.

36:54.630 --> 36:57.884
When these babies go off,
all hell's gonna break loose.

36:57.967 --> 36:59.802
Hey, just watch what the fuck you're doing.

36:59.886 --> 37:02.555
The beauty is,
speakers will still be able to work.

37:03.806 --> 37:04.891
Trigger's very simple.

37:04.974 --> 37:06.017
Hey, bro.

37:06.142 --> 37:07.977
Nah. Hold on one sec.

37:08.060 --> 37:11.188
Now, will you
just shut the fuck up and concentrate?

37:11.522 --> 37:12.982
Are you sure?

37:13.399 --> 37:14.859
Bobby. I'm...

37:15.359 --> 37:16.694
Look at this thing.

37:16.777 --> 37:18.988
Stop playing with that thing.

37:21.073 --> 37:22.158
Fuck!

37:22.366 --> 37:23.743
What the hell was that?

37:26.037 --> 37:27.163
What!

37:29.123 --> 37:30.416
He's alive.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.584
Who?

37:33.961 --> 37:36.088
Parker. He knows we're here.

37:36.547 --> 37:38.841
He ambushed my brother.
He tried to kill him.

37:39.675 --> 37:41.177
Parker's dead.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.680
You got out of the SUV and you shot him.

37:45.181 --> 37:46.599
- Right?
- Yes.

37:47.642 --> 37:49.060
- I fucking shot him.
- You...

37:50.061 --> 37:51.354
I fucking...

37:51.437 --> 37:53.731
He was dead when I fucking left him!
I swear to God!

37:53.814 --> 37:55.107
We need five men for the gig.

37:55.691 --> 37:57.902
We can get by with four.
It don't work with three.

37:57.985 --> 37:59.070
Fuck!

38:01.155 --> 38:02.490
All right.

38:03.282 --> 38:04.367
Okay.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.871
You get with your uncle in Chicago

38:09.080 --> 38:11.207
and you have him handle this.

38:11.290 --> 38:13.292
With a real professional.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.044
Now.

38:17.755 --> 38:19.674
That fucking Danzinger better do something

38:19.757 --> 38:22.969
for all the money
he's going to make on this haul.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.226
The Mafia doesn't usually touch family,

38:30.309 --> 38:31.852
but who knows with Danzinger.

38:31.936 --> 38:34.063
I'm not taking any chances.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.357
Jen should be packed.

38:37.066 --> 38:39.235
I'll be back and get you in 15 minutes.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.569
Yeah.

38:40.736 --> 38:43.072
Hey, don't worry. He'll be fine.

38:45.574 --> 38:46.909
Claire...

38:48.411 --> 38:49.745
It happens.

38:50.121 --> 38:51.747
Yeah. Not to me.

38:52.081 --> 38:54.500
God. Dad, it never happened to us.

38:54.917 --> 38:56.127
Yeah, I know.

38:56.210 --> 38:57.670
Times change.

38:57.962 --> 39:01.424
I'm the one that should be jealous.
He called you first.

39:08.597 --> 39:10.808
Lock these doors. All of them.

39:11.642 --> 39:14.645
I'll be back with your
stepmom in 10 minutes.

41:37.079 --> 41:38.122
Parker?

41:40.082 --> 41:41.250
Did you get my message?

41:41.333 --> 41:42.918
<i>Yeah. Then my dad came by.</i>

41:43.878 --> 41:45.045
Two minutes after he left,

41:45.129 --> 41:47.339
a strange man with a big
knife let himself in.

41:47.423 --> 41:50.134
Was that... Was that a message, too?

41:53.512 --> 41:56.015
Listen. Drive straight
to the fishing camp at Okeechobee.

41:56.098 --> 41:57.558
No stops, no calls.

41:57.975 --> 42:00.853
<i>You'll be safe there.
Gotta make sure I'm not being followed.</i>

42:00.936 --> 42:02.229
How long?

42:04.356 --> 42:05.441
I'll be there Friday.

42:06.734 --> 42:08.444
What if you're not?

42:11.739 --> 42:13.073
Parker!

42:16.452 --> 42:18.704
Empty the cash out of the storage locker
and disappear.

42:28.297 --> 42:30.382
<i>Look, I'm one commission away.</i>

42:30.466 --> 42:32.968
<i>I'll get it to you by the end of the week.
I swear.</i>

42:33.052 --> 42:35.387
<i>No, you don't understand.
I need my car for work.</i>

42:35.471 --> 42:37.223
<i>If you repossess my car, I can't pay you.</i>

42:37.306 --> 42:40.059
<i>Please, just... Just give me another week.</i>

42:41.393 --> 42:44.230
<i>Great. Thank you. Next week at the latest.</i>

42:49.026 --> 42:51.070
Hi. An Americano with two Splendas, please.

42:51.153 --> 42:52.446
We've got it all ready for you, Leslie.

42:52.529 --> 42:54.031
Thanks for remembering.

42:54.114 --> 42:55.783
Leslie Cienfuegos.

42:56.825 --> 42:58.244
- Rodgers.
- Right.

42:58.786 --> 43:00.871
How is the ex? You hear from him?

43:02.039 --> 43:03.916
Shouldn't you be over in West Palm?

43:04.625 --> 43:06.502
I like it here fine. Like you do.

43:08.087 --> 43:10.130
Hey, you have a cup holder in your car?

43:10.214 --> 43:11.924
Or you just keep that between your legs?

43:13.217 --> 43:15.344
Well, it's large and black, Jake.

43:15.427 --> 43:17.012
Where do you think I like it?

43:22.351 --> 43:25.187
Yeah. We'll see who's laughing next
time you need a ticket fixed.

43:25.271 --> 43:26.313
Jackass.

43:40.869 --> 43:43.539
Don't fuck with us!
Just give us Parker and you're done!

43:43.664 --> 43:46.375
Am I talking to you, boy?
Am I talking to you? Shut up!

43:46.458 --> 43:48.877
Fuck you! You know who we are?

43:49.003 --> 43:51.213
You deliver
or you're gonna be dead like Parker.

43:51.297 --> 43:53.716
What are you talking about?
I don't know any Parker!

44:00.222 --> 44:01.390
Watch out!

44:05.227 --> 44:06.395
Dissatisfied customers?

44:06.478 --> 44:09.523
I don't have dissatisfied customers.
What I have is you.

44:09.606 --> 44:11.150
And now I have this!

44:12.234 --> 44:13.527
Your gun.

44:14.820 --> 44:16.363
Give me what I came for and I'm gone.

44:16.447 --> 44:19.241
You brought them here, now you get
down on the floor with them, boy!

44:19.616 --> 44:23.787
We had a deal, Norte. I gave you
your money, now give me my papers.

44:23.996 --> 44:25.956
Fuck your papers! I don't
need this bullshit!

44:26.373 --> 44:27.875
Did they say they were from Chicago?

44:28.250 --> 44:29.460
- We didn't say.
- Shut up!

44:30.419 --> 44:31.545
Get on the floor.

44:31.628 --> 44:32.921
Did they mention
someone named Danzinger?

44:33.005 --> 44:34.298
Look, I don't know anything.

44:34.381 --> 44:35.924
All I know is, I got a situation here.

44:36.508 --> 44:39.178
You know who I think brought them here?
Ernesto. He sold you out.

44:39.261 --> 44:40.429
Get on the floor!

44:55.152 --> 44:56.945
All right. I'm done.

45:01.617 --> 45:04.620
Hey, look. We...
We don't have to kill each other.

45:05.579 --> 45:08.957
These men wanted you.
I don't want any part of it anymore.

45:09.041 --> 45:10.793
I'm like... Sweden.

45:12.127 --> 45:13.253
You mean Switzerland.

45:13.629 --> 45:15.506
Whatever.

45:15.589 --> 45:17.341
Your documents are in that middle drawer.

45:17.424 --> 45:19.304
- Right behind me. Right there.
- Take them out.

45:30.854 --> 45:32.398
Daniel Parmitt.

45:33.774 --> 45:35.401
- Ecuador.
- You're an American citizen.

45:35.484 --> 45:38.612
Born in Ecuador.
There's lots of gringos down there.

45:38.695 --> 45:40.280
Your family was in the oil business.

45:42.449 --> 45:43.575
Pick up the gun.

45:45.285 --> 45:46.870
Now look here, there's not very many people

45:46.954 --> 45:48.956
that can do what I do as well as I do.

45:49.039 --> 45:50.833
If I get dead,
a lot of people are gonna be very upset

45:50.916 --> 45:52.209
and they're gonna come get you.

45:52.292 --> 45:56.046
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everyone's gonna get me. Pick it up.

46:01.385 --> 46:02.428
Shoot them.

46:04.930 --> 46:07.599
The other way we can do this
is I shoot 'em, then I shoot you.

46:07.683 --> 46:09.184
I'm trying to help you here, Norte.

46:11.728 --> 46:14.022
Listen, pal, you can still
get out of this alive.

46:17.151 --> 46:18.694
Why did you stop?

46:19.361 --> 46:20.446
They're dead!

46:20.988 --> 46:23.532
Then they won't feel it. Keep going!

46:29.204 --> 46:30.789
Toss me the gun.

46:38.881 --> 46:41.133
So now what? You got a hold on me, right?

46:41.216 --> 46:42.759
I don't need a hold over you.

46:42.843 --> 46:44.428
Not if you make all this disappear

46:44.511 --> 46:46.231
and tell anyone who asks I never showed up.

46:46.472 --> 46:47.556
What do I say about them?

46:48.223 --> 46:49.516
Maybe they died on the way here.

46:53.228 --> 46:56.231
Don't forget to take care
of their Navigator outside.

46:59.359 --> 47:00.569
Ecuador.

47:02.696 --> 47:04.490
I just hate flying. I hate it.

47:04.573 --> 47:07.409
I mean, the goddamn landing was terrifying.

47:07.576 --> 47:11.497
It went up on one wheel.
I thought I was gonna die for a minute.

47:11.705 --> 47:15.375
I mean, Jesus, Jen's already
at the lake with the damn dog.

47:16.043 --> 47:18.086
- What about Claire?
- Taken care of.

47:18.629 --> 47:20.005
I promise she's safe.

47:20.088 --> 47:21.340
All right.

47:21.423 --> 47:25.552
Okay, so, Danzinger must be the fence to
get 20 cents on the dollar.

47:25.719 --> 47:26.919
That's why Hardwicke's around.

47:27.179 --> 47:28.931
Yeah, I'd think so.

47:29.097 --> 47:31.934
You know, two million dollar share,

47:32.017 --> 47:34.561
five ways, 20 cents on the dollar...

47:35.854 --> 47:37.272
Fifty million dollar score.

47:37.523 --> 47:39.107
Yeah. So where in Palm Beach?

47:39.274 --> 47:40.609
No, no.

47:40.776 --> 47:44.571
Parker, I'm telling you, Bobby was lying.
Not Palm Beach.

47:46.323 --> 47:50.452
Look, the problem is not the score,
the problem is Palm Beach.

47:50.744 --> 47:54.623
Nobody does business there.
There's a cop to every eight residents.

47:54.706 --> 47:55.749
Drawbridges.

47:55.832 --> 47:57.793
They could shut the island down like that.

47:58.377 --> 47:59.378
You're trapped.

47:59.461 --> 48:02.798
The state pen
is full of lightweights that have tried it.

48:03.131 --> 48:05.801
You know Melander. Is he a lightweight?

48:09.388 --> 48:11.807
No, Melander's not a lightweight.

48:12.975 --> 48:14.851
But it doesn't matter.

48:15.143 --> 48:17.688
Listen, I got a call from Danzinger.

48:18.522 --> 48:22.901
And for whatever the reason,
they want it to go down without a hitch

48:24.319 --> 48:26.822
so they sent me this to give to you.

48:28.115 --> 48:31.743
This is your Ohio share plus 10 points.

48:32.828 --> 48:35.289
Take it. Go somewhere with Claire.

48:35.914 --> 48:38.875
Keep your money.
Who are you kidding, Hurley?

48:38.959 --> 48:41.003
Chicago doesn't pay
to keep people out of their way.

48:41.420 --> 48:44.881
For Christ's sake, Parker,
Danzinger's a fucking savage.

48:45.007 --> 48:48.594
He sent an assassin to your home,
he almost killed my daughter.

48:48.677 --> 48:50.262
I'm just trying to help you.

48:50.345 --> 48:53.181
I don't want it from you.
I want it from them!

48:53.473 --> 48:54.516
It's the principle.

48:55.350 --> 48:56.685
Principle.

48:58.729 --> 49:01.815
You wanna get yourself
killed over principle?

49:02.566 --> 49:04.109
And me? Claire?

49:04.776 --> 49:06.028
Is that what the fuck you want?

49:06.528 --> 49:07.988
You almost died on a plane runway.

49:08.071 --> 49:09.281
If it's gonna happen, it'll happen.

49:09.364 --> 49:11.825
It's not something you can control.

49:12.284 --> 49:13.577
When I enter an agreement with someone,

49:13.660 --> 49:15.287
terms on both sides have to be honored.

49:15.370 --> 49:16.496
If they're not, and I allow that,

49:16.580 --> 49:19.541
I'm asking chaos to take
control of my life.

49:19.875 --> 49:21.585
Nobody likes chaos.

49:22.419 --> 49:23.545
Yeah.

49:25.756 --> 49:28.800
Yeah, no one likes chaos. That's right.

49:29.259 --> 49:30.719
Hey, look, what if...

49:32.054 --> 49:34.473
What if you had a place in Palm Beach
to sit things out?

49:34.556 --> 49:36.767
Nah, nah. Cops would be
all over the rentals.

49:37.309 --> 49:39.603
Nah, not a rental. What if you...

49:40.270 --> 49:41.772
What if you bought a house?

49:52.240 --> 49:54.409
Palm Partners, how may I help you?

49:54.493 --> 49:56.536
Hey, Noelle, any messages?

49:56.620 --> 49:59.247
All right. I will transfer
you to Mr. Samson.

50:00.415 --> 50:02.584
Why do you even read the society pages?

50:02.668 --> 50:04.920
It's not like you could ever
go to one of those parties.

50:05.420 --> 50:06.880
Look, if a normal couple gets divorced,

50:06.963 --> 50:09.341
they need two houses instead of one.

50:09.424 --> 50:12.844
Rich couple gets divorced,
they need four houses instead of two.

50:12.928 --> 50:14.346
I don't know what you're worried about.

50:14.429 --> 50:16.390
It took me two years
to get my first commission.

50:16.473 --> 50:18.100
Even then, it's only a quarter share.

50:18.475 --> 50:21.035
Yeah, well, I would've had my first
if Jameson hadn't swooped in.

50:21.770 --> 50:23.021
Morning, ladies.

50:23.105 --> 50:25.023
If I don't sell something
soon, I'm screwed.

50:25.107 --> 50:27.943
Amber picked up a cold call
from some rich-ass Texan

50:28.026 --> 50:30.195
looking to buy his third vacation home.

50:30.278 --> 50:32.614
I've been answering the phone
for three weeks, and nothing.

50:34.282 --> 50:37.202
They are great clients. All cash.

50:38.829 --> 50:40.831
- What's Amber's line?
- Twelve.

50:49.256 --> 50:50.424
Hello?

50:51.299 --> 50:52.620
- Yes.
- But I'm gonna close them.

50:54.970 --> 50:56.471
Excuse me one minute, sir. Thank you.

50:56.555 --> 50:59.391
No problem. Absolutely. I'll let her know.

51:01.476 --> 51:02.978
Hello? Hello?

51:05.564 --> 51:09.109
That was Mr. Thompson. He said he wants to
close on Edgewater right away.

51:09.192 --> 51:10.402
Said he's gonna be flying in at noon.

51:10.485 --> 51:13.488
His phone died
while I was on the phone with him.

51:15.115 --> 51:17.396
If you want I can
go take care of that for you right away.

51:18.493 --> 51:20.746
That's so sweet of you. But no.

51:29.254 --> 51:31.548
- One, one, at a price of 1,000...
- Noelle?

51:31.631 --> 51:33.049
Excuse me one moment.

51:33.133 --> 51:34.593
Call Mr. Parmitt at the Boca Resort

51:34.676 --> 51:36.716
and tell him that
I'll call him later to reschedule.

51:36.720 --> 51:37.929
Of course.

51:38.013 --> 51:41.933
Sorry about that. Again,
the price was $1,155.

51:42.392 --> 51:45.020
And item 8-0-0-0

51:45.228 --> 51:49.357
at a cost of $2,353.20.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.080
I can't believe you just stole her client.

51:52.152 --> 51:55.614
There's nothing wrong
with a little stealing now and then.

51:55.697 --> 51:57.115
They do it to us all the time.

52:09.503 --> 52:11.671
Welcome to the Boca Resort.

52:18.887 --> 52:19.971
Mr. Parmitt?

52:24.476 --> 52:25.936
Miss Rodgers.

52:27.395 --> 52:28.438
Yes.

52:29.898 --> 52:31.858
Anybody who's somebody, and rich,

52:31.942 --> 52:33.527
winds up in Palm Beach.

52:33.610 --> 52:36.279
I mean, more billionaires
per square foot than anywhere else.

52:36.905 --> 52:39.741
Palm Beach is about style. Community.

52:40.033 --> 52:42.077
You know, it's... It's
not about money at all.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.203
Of course not.

52:44.329 --> 52:46.081
Where do you live now?

52:46.164 --> 52:49.751
I got a place in Vail.
One in South Padre Island. One in Maine.

52:50.460 --> 52:51.545
Yeah.

52:52.003 --> 52:55.340
I'd like to see
a few more areas before zeroing in on one.

52:55.757 --> 52:57.050
Do you have time tomorrow?

52:57.133 --> 52:58.844
Sure, yeah. I have all the time you need

52:58.927 --> 53:00.637
to zero in on anything you want.

53:03.431 --> 53:05.851
I'll pick you up at your office at 10:00.

53:07.811 --> 53:11.147
I'll never remember
my way around unless I do the driving.

53:13.400 --> 53:14.609
Taxi.

53:14.693 --> 53:16.152
Can I drop you somewhere?

53:16.236 --> 53:17.904
No, thanks. I'm good.

53:23.535 --> 53:25.370
- Where to?
- Lake Okeechobee, please.

53:25.453 --> 53:28.081
- Yes, sir.
- Take Highway 441 to Pelican Bay.

53:50.145 --> 53:52.063
Pardon me, ma'am.

53:55.150 --> 53:58.403
Daniel Parmitt. San Antonio, Texas.

54:09.372 --> 54:11.875
I thought we agreed, no more scars.

54:13.209 --> 54:15.211
I don't want to lose you.

54:19.257 --> 54:20.425
Hey.

54:26.097 --> 54:29.267
I keep thinking
about that man inside our house.

54:30.268 --> 54:33.730
I've been around thieves my whole life,
but this guy...

54:34.356 --> 54:35.982
He was a killer.

54:37.233 --> 54:38.652
He really scared me.

54:39.653 --> 54:41.237
They wouldn't have killed you, Claire.

54:42.697 --> 54:43.907
They'd use you to get to me.

54:44.616 --> 54:46.368
Then killed us both.

54:55.043 --> 54:56.878
You can leave, Claire.

54:59.047 --> 55:00.548
No one would blame you.

55:07.222 --> 55:11.601
This ltalianate villa was built three years ago.
It's only $17 million.

55:12.727 --> 55:16.898
If it were older and one mile down
the beach, it'd be $35 million.

55:19.150 --> 55:20.402
You like?

55:24.280 --> 55:27.117
You know, the furnishings are all antique
and they could be available

55:27.200 --> 55:29.786
for, you know... For the right price.

55:32.372 --> 55:34.124
So, married?

55:37.085 --> 55:39.129
Once. She passed away.

55:40.714 --> 55:42.340
I'm sorry.

55:42.465 --> 55:44.592
What about you?
What does your husband do?

55:46.011 --> 55:47.971
Divorced. Eleven months.

55:49.264 --> 55:53.935
He was a salesman. He sold me.
The whole dream.

55:55.937 --> 55:57.689
I thought he was something.

55:57.772 --> 55:59.691
His Ferrari was rented.

56:00.442 --> 56:02.485
At least it wasn't stolen.

56:02.944 --> 56:06.448
Well, he declared bankruptcy
before the divorce

56:07.449 --> 56:09.451
so I get to help him pay off his debt

56:09.534 --> 56:13.079
while he lives there
in Key West with his new girlfriend.

56:13.329 --> 56:15.123
And I do mean "girl."

56:15.999 --> 56:17.751
This one right over here,
this has been on the market

56:17.834 --> 56:20.336
for about a year for about $27.5,

56:20.420 --> 56:24.966
but if you make an offer now you could
probably get it for about $19.5-ish.

56:25.216 --> 56:26.301
It's a good price.

56:28.887 --> 56:31.848
This is, obviously, more of a neighborhood.

56:31.931 --> 56:34.559
The one here, with the
screen of palm trees,

56:34.642 --> 56:38.480
this house sold, about two months ago,
for $1.2 million.

56:40.857 --> 56:43.443
Mr. Rodrigo says he wants to renovate.

56:43.526 --> 56:45.737
Can you believe it?
It's obviously a tear down.

56:45.987 --> 56:47.363
Mr. Rodrigo?

56:47.864 --> 56:49.991
Yeah. Amber sold it to him.

56:51.534 --> 56:54.621
You know, I think he said
he's from Texas, too.

56:55.371 --> 56:57.457
I'll have to meet him some day.

57:00.001 --> 57:03.001
You know, the one nice thing about it
is the lntracoastal's right down here.

57:03.004 --> 57:06.341
Wraps right around the houses.
It's really beautiful.

57:10.553 --> 57:13.765
See what I mean?
The lntracoastal widens out here.

57:18.269 --> 57:20.647
So you lived in San
Antonio your whole life?

57:21.481 --> 57:24.567
Yeah. Since I was about three.

57:25.777 --> 57:27.362
Tell the truth, I was born in Ecuador.

57:28.905 --> 57:31.407
My folks are both
in the oil business down there.

57:31.699 --> 57:33.368
Ecuador? Really?

57:34.202 --> 57:35.962
That's what it says on
my birth certificate.

57:42.836 --> 57:46.297
I was in the management training program
here before I got married.

57:46.381 --> 57:50.093
I could've got you a great discounted
room rate, say, 11 years ago.

57:53.138 --> 57:54.472
You know, do you mind
if I hold on to these?

57:54.556 --> 57:57.183
Fax a few to my banker so he knows
ahead of time what I'm getting into?

57:57.308 --> 57:58.977
Yeah, sure. I mean, they're all sold.

57:59.060 --> 58:00.478
I just wind up tossing them anyway.

58:00.562 --> 58:02.272
Here. My card, too.

58:03.731 --> 58:06.276
Mr. Parmitt? Daniel?

58:08.611 --> 58:11.281
I know that you're in town alone,
so, if you'd like,

58:11.364 --> 58:14.534
we can go over more
places, say, over dinner

58:14.617 --> 58:16.578
or just drinks?

58:16.995 --> 58:20.081
That is so kind,
but I'm afraid I have other plans.

58:21.666 --> 58:23.418
- I'll be in touch.
- Okay.

58:28.590 --> 58:29.757
Plans.

59:14.302 --> 59:15.678
Pipsy, Stop-

59:16.930 --> 59:19.265
Leslie, put on the soap channel.

59:19.974 --> 59:22.644
Do we have to have
the soap opera channel always on?

59:22.894 --> 59:23.978
I pay for it.

59:24.187 --> 59:25.438
I pay every minute.

59:25.688 --> 59:26.814
I heard that.

59:29.108 --> 59:30.318
I heard that, too.

01:00:26.874 --> 01:00:30.461
See? This is
the kind of outfit you would look great in.

01:00:31.379 --> 01:00:32.964
Don't tell me. It's Tuesday night.

01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:35.049
I'm off to poker. You're minding Pipsy.

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:38.761
Actually, Marta's still in the hospital.
Why don't you come?

01:00:38.845 --> 01:00:39.929
We'll put Pipsy in the carrier.

01:00:40.013 --> 01:00:41.806
The girls would love to see you!

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:47.580
All right, let's get it while it's hot.

01:01:47.663 --> 01:01:49.540
Jesus Christ. I'm over this shit.
I'm sick of beans.

01:01:49.624 --> 01:01:50.666
We have to lay low.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:51.793
What? That's bullshit.

01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:54.295
I don't understand what the big deal is
to go out and get two pizzas.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.215
We'll go. But we call it in,
we go and we pick it up

01:01:57.298 --> 01:01:58.883
and we bring it back here to eat. Okay?

01:01:58.966 --> 01:02:00.259
I'm getting cheese.

01:02:00.343 --> 01:02:01.424
I'm getting two pepperonis.

01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:20.173
If he's in town, we can't risk him

01:03:20.256 --> 01:03:22.633
getting any of us alone.
We have to lay low...

01:03:22.717 --> 01:03:25.011
My uncle sent his best guy
to take care of Parker.

01:03:25.094 --> 01:03:28.347
Mr. Danzinger's going to be
very disappointed you haven't seen Parker.

01:03:28.431 --> 01:03:30.475
Listen, my friend, I keep telling you.

01:03:30.558 --> 01:03:32.768
I don't know anybody
named Parker, all right?

01:03:34.562 --> 01:03:35.771
Nice new carpet.

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:21.526
I love that shit. Give me those pies.

01:05:10.116 --> 01:05:11.909
I ain't waiting for you old guys.

01:05:11.993 --> 01:05:13.536
Get that pizza in there.

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:16.038
Don't worry about it, man.
I got the pepperoni.

01:05:50.698 --> 01:05:53.367
If you're free,
maybe we can go for that drink now.

01:05:58.539 --> 01:06:00.291
Who knows you're here, Leslie?

01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:04.128
If you want to go somewhere more private,
we can go to your hotel.

01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:05.755
Or we can go to the office.
I have the keys.

01:06:05.838 --> 01:06:07.918
You know, Mr. Crenshaw
usually keeps a nice bottle...

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:10.426
When I ask you a question,
you need to answer.

01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:12.386
You're hurting my neck!

01:06:13.054 --> 01:06:15.222
Who knows you're here, Leslie?

01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:17.558
No one, okay? No one!

01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:21.395
- Let's go to your office.
- Fuck!

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:31.030
You know, everything you did in the car
today was almost right. Almost.

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:33.991
But <i>I</i> didn't buy it.

01:06:34.867 --> 01:06:36.327
Is Daniel Parmitt your real name?

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:37.912
Why wouldn't it be?

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:40.873
Because you're less than two months old.

01:06:42.249 --> 01:06:45.252
You have a bank account, an address
in Texas, and a driver's license.

01:06:45.336 --> 01:06:48.047
You never owned
or leased a car before this one.

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:50.091
You never had a credit card
and you never had a mortgage.

01:06:50.299 --> 01:06:53.427
You know, I've traveled a lot.
My family business pays for everything.

01:06:53.511 --> 01:06:57.181
And the only house you showed
any interest in was the one back there.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:58.307
Mr. Rodrigo's.

01:06:58.724 --> 01:07:00.017
Really? It was back there?

01:07:00.768 --> 01:07:02.144
Really.

01:07:07.233 --> 01:07:09.985
You know, I looked into Mr. Rodrigo, too.

01:07:12.655 --> 01:07:14.490
He's only six months old.

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:23.165
Okay. Why are you parking
all the way over here?

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:26.127
We could've parked
right in front of the office.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:27.753
There'd be no cars there
this time of night.

01:07:27.837 --> 01:07:29.130
Let's go.

01:07:30.965 --> 01:07:33.050
Unless you don't want
a chance of being seen.

01:07:33.134 --> 01:07:35.094
Is that what's going on?

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:38.139
- Wait a minute.
- Keep moving.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.850
Don't turn those on.

01:07:41.642 --> 01:07:43.185
English accent.

01:07:43.978 --> 01:07:46.230
I knew you weren't from Texas.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.821
Look at that. A nice Chablis.

01:07:54.655 --> 01:07:56.532
Will you be joining me?

01:07:57.032 --> 01:07:58.993
Okay, well, I'm thirsty.

01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:07.001
Yeah. I drink too much.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.754
And I worry too much.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.673
Divorced, pushing 40.

01:08:15.009 --> 01:08:18.261
I have a sister
I haven't spoken to in five years.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.015
And I'm stuck with my mom.

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:25.685
Doesn't look like
she's going to kick off any time soon.

01:08:30.733 --> 01:08:34.319
I'm sick of chauffeuring
these fucking entitled

01:08:35.696 --> 01:08:39.450
wannabe playboys
who have never worked a day in their life.

01:08:40.326 --> 01:08:43.370
Showing them houses
that I could never afford.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:47.416
Laughing at their jokes that I can't stand.

01:08:50.711 --> 01:08:53.339
All while fending off their gropes...

01:08:53.881 --> 01:08:55.883
But not all their gropes.

01:08:57.968 --> 01:08:59.011
Because you never know.

01:08:59.094 --> 01:09:02.515
One of these days
I just might get a full commission.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.776
So if you're going to kill me, go ahead.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.694
I live with a snapshot of my future

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:19.156
and nobody's going to know
and nobody's going to care.

01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:23.077
But if you're not, I can help you.

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:25.203
Help me?

01:09:26.705 --> 01:09:29.542
People in Palm Beach are sharp. Very sharp.

01:09:29.625 --> 01:09:32.461
And people like you
only come down here for one reason, money.

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:33.671
And I don't know what you're into...

01:09:33.754 --> 01:09:36.090
Kidnapping, extortion, robbery...

01:09:36.799 --> 01:09:39.635
But whatever it is, you're gonna need
somebody who knows the territory

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.429
or you're gonna get caught.

01:09:44.807 --> 01:09:46.600
Take off your clothes.

01:09:51.063 --> 01:09:52.147
What?

01:09:53.274 --> 01:09:55.401
I'm not sure
if I'm better off with you alive or dead.

01:09:55.484 --> 01:09:58.779
Either way, I have to know
if you're wearing a wire.

01:10:17.172 --> 01:10:20.551
Look, I've been in
a third of the houses around here

01:10:20.676 --> 01:10:22.386
and I know the rest.

01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:24.305
I can answer your questions

01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:27.725
and I can tell you
what questions you're forgetting to ask.

01:10:27.808 --> 01:10:29.476
And all I'm asking

01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:34.273
is for you to give me a small piece

01:10:35.649 --> 01:10:38.068
so I can get the hell out of here.

01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:42.281
- Turn around.
- What?

01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:43.532
Turn around!

01:10:55.044 --> 01:10:56.712
You know, to even find Rodrigo,

01:10:56.795 --> 01:10:58.130
you had to play that
roundabout game with me

01:10:58.213 --> 01:11:00.132
and all it did was make me suspicious.

01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:03.761
I mean, how many people
do you want asking questions about you?

01:11:07.014 --> 01:11:08.515
Lift your hair.

01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:25.407
Get dressed.

01:11:27.993 --> 01:11:31.163
Wash up the wine glasses.
Lock up before you leave.

01:11:32.623 --> 01:11:33.707
I'll think about it.

01:11:53.894 --> 01:11:54.937
Hey, Lionel!

01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:57.898
What do you say?
I got something for your jones.

01:11:58.273 --> 01:12:00.192
Don't blow it all on the ponies again.

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:03.612
Tell me what you got.
I want to know every last detail.

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:16.500
Leslie! Okay, last chance.

01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:19.420
All this right here
could be yours for one low price.

01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:22.589
Hey. What's the matter?

01:12:24.133 --> 01:12:25.592
Nothing. Just...

01:12:25.676 --> 01:12:28.178
I bought a lottery ticket two days ago.

01:12:28.262 --> 01:12:29.763
I don't think it's going to pay off.

01:12:29.847 --> 01:12:32.099
Leslie, what'd you do that for?
Those things are a waste.

01:12:41.150 --> 01:12:42.901
Hello? Mr. Parmitt?

01:12:44.278 --> 01:12:47.072
Yeah, I have
the perfect condo that I could show you!

01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:50.743
I'll meet you
at 1000 Ocean Avenue in 20 minutes.

01:12:52.244 --> 01:12:53.287
Yes!

01:13:03.964 --> 01:13:05.716
<i>Signal four, rollover with injuries</i>

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:08.552
<i>at 124 North County Road. Code one.</i>

01:13:10.137 --> 01:13:12.639
Right on time. You can park right there.

01:13:17.144 --> 01:13:19.188
<i>Bravo 24, please respond.</i>

01:13:22.691 --> 01:13:24.193
So, I'm hired?

01:13:30.824 --> 01:13:34.119
You don't have to
check me for a wire again, do you?

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:37.539
I mean, you can if you want.

01:13:48.467 --> 01:13:50.511
We got work to do, Leslie.

01:13:54.348 --> 01:13:55.724
You're hard to read.

01:13:55.808 --> 01:13:58.393
Not really. Let's just stick to business.

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:10.864
Here's the deal.

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:12.366
Don't ask me any questions

01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:15.786
because I'm only going to
tell you what I want to tell you.

01:14:16.036 --> 01:14:19.289
The man who calls himself Rodrigo
took something from me.

01:14:19.373 --> 01:14:22.000
He's in business with three other men.

01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:24.378
They're here for a robbery

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:28.048
and they're gonna use that house
to lay low when they're done.

01:14:28.257 --> 01:14:29.383
So...

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.637
You let them steal something,

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.557
you steal it from them.

01:14:37.558 --> 01:14:38.892
I help you

01:14:40.394 --> 01:14:42.312
and I get a commission.

01:14:50.696 --> 01:14:52.216
You're going to kill them, aren't you?

01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:54.116
I never said that, Leslie. You did.

01:14:56.285 --> 01:14:58.036
Civilized people need to follow rules.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.080
I'm just going to put things right.

01:15:08.964 --> 01:15:10.424
Where are they going to hit?

01:15:11.175 --> 01:15:13.093
I thought that was
something you could tell me.

01:15:14.428 --> 01:15:15.470
You don't know?

01:15:16.763 --> 01:15:19.433
Well, when are they doing it?

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.352
I don't know that either.

01:15:22.603 --> 01:15:23.687
But it's jewelry.

01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:27.024
None of the stores
I've checked have the inventory.

01:15:27.107 --> 01:15:28.150
How large?

01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:31.195
Fifty to seventy-five million.

01:15:35.574 --> 01:15:37.451
Mrs. Clendon's jewels?

01:15:37.618 --> 01:15:41.288
Are you fucking kidding me? Forget it!

01:15:41.788 --> 01:15:43.749
They are going to get caught, or killed

01:15:43.832 --> 01:15:45.592
and so are you if you're
anywhere near them!

01:15:45.626 --> 01:15:49.671
Leslie! You can't leave. You're in.

01:15:56.261 --> 01:16:00.057
Miriam Hope Clendon
was the first lady of Palm Beach Society.

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:02.434
She had more diamonds
than Elizabeth Taylor!

01:16:02.517 --> 01:16:05.145
And when she died,
she left the entire estate to Palm Beach.

01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:08.232
They're auctioning off
her $75 million jewelry collection

01:16:08.315 --> 01:16:10.359
right here tomorrow night.

01:16:11.318 --> 01:16:12.527
What's behind there?

01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:15.364
Thirty acres, a golf course, pool,

01:16:15.489 --> 01:16:17.324
tennis courts, two ballrooms,

01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:20.452
and it's one of the only houses
that's on the ocean and the lntracoastal.

01:16:20.535 --> 01:16:23.080
Hey, Miss! This is private property!

01:16:23.997 --> 01:16:26.667
Sorry, guys. Just taking in the sights.

01:16:29.211 --> 01:16:30.921
No, no, no. That's too much white.

01:16:31.004 --> 01:16:33.173
Take them away
and bring back some pink roses.

01:16:34.341 --> 01:16:37.261
- And just what is this now?
- Speakers for the auctioneer.

01:16:37.511 --> 01:16:39.554
Small ballroom. Around to the right.

01:16:39.638 --> 01:16:43.308
Okay, Linda, you cover
the left side, Robert, the right.

01:16:43.392 --> 01:16:48.605
Report all paddle numbers to Barry,
who will be standing next to me.

01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:50.774
Where do you want these?

01:16:50.857 --> 01:16:52.234
Put speakers in the corners.

01:16:54.528 --> 01:16:56.530
Barry, excuse me a minute, would you?

01:16:58.323 --> 01:17:00.367
Go get the gear.
I'll meet you by the basement.

01:17:13.547 --> 01:17:15.966
Stash that shit by the exit.

01:17:20.053 --> 01:17:21.305
Hurry UP!

01:17:22.764 --> 01:17:24.975
So, you been in jail?

01:17:30.981 --> 01:17:32.566
Do you ever feel bad about what you do?

01:17:33.150 --> 01:17:34.901
Everyone steals, Leslie.

01:17:35.402 --> 01:17:38.155
Some people admit it to themselves,
some don't. It's what human beings do.

01:17:38.238 --> 01:17:39.614
That's why we invented locks.

01:17:40.741 --> 01:17:42.993
You think the people
in these houses feel bad?

01:17:43.076 --> 01:17:45.203
Their grandparents
and their great grandparents,

01:17:45.287 --> 01:17:47.205
they're the ones who got their hands dirty.

01:17:48.832 --> 01:17:50.876
I just mean, how do you sleep at night?

01:17:52.586 --> 01:17:54.755
I don't drink coffee after 7:00.

01:17:57.758 --> 01:18:00.093
- Is this the back entrance?
- Yes.

01:18:26.286 --> 01:18:28.205
There's a taxi stand at the Breakers.

01:18:29.206 --> 01:18:30.749
- What's going on?
- Out.

01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:32.626
Out!

01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:36.797
Wait a minute.
Can't you, like... What's the plan?

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.590
What do I wear? Do I wear black?
What are we doing?

01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:40.467
Go to your office. I'll handle this.

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:43.970
This is getting old, you know!

01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:52.145
Welcome back to the Boca, Mr. Parmitt.

01:18:53.647 --> 01:18:55.023
Keep it handy, Carlos.

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:43.918
<i>Leslie, someone's at the door.</i>

01:22:49.883 --> 01:22:52.218
Leslie, someone's at the door.

01:22:55.764 --> 01:22:56.765
Jake.

01:22:57.724 --> 01:22:58.725
Leslie.

01:22:59.392 --> 01:23:00.560
Mind if I come in?

01:23:00.685 --> 01:23:03.229
Yeah, I do mind. What time is it?

01:23:04.105 --> 01:23:06.358
I mean, how the hell did
you get my address?

01:23:06.566 --> 01:23:07.984
It's sort of official.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:09.569
Don't let him in!

01:23:11.071 --> 01:23:13.406
At least make your dog shut up!

01:23:13.698 --> 01:23:15.283
Can you do that?

01:23:16.785 --> 01:23:18.119
Yeah, what's going on?

01:23:20.413 --> 01:23:22.749
It's about a man named Daniel Parmitt.

01:23:26.795 --> 01:23:28.588
I don't know even how to use this thing.

01:23:28.672 --> 01:23:30.965
That's why I always get coffee.

01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:33.677
What... What about Mr. Parmitt?

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:35.428
Do you know him?

01:23:35.762 --> 01:23:37.389
Yeah, he's in town from Texas.

01:23:37.472 --> 01:23:40.100
I... I showed him some places,

01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:46.272
and he turned out to be a real time-waster.

01:23:48.608 --> 01:23:50.728
I happened to be driving
past Sloan's Curve yesterday,

01:23:50.777 --> 01:23:52.654
and I saw you talking to someone.

01:23:52.946 --> 01:23:54.614
Yep, that was him.

01:23:55.699 --> 01:23:57.450
I showed him a condo.

01:23:57.534 --> 01:24:00.295
You think you can get the other list
of all the places you showed him?

01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:02.706
Sure. I'd have to get it from the office.

01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:03.832
Why?

01:24:04.457 --> 01:24:06.835
Well, if there's a vacant place
that he knows about...

01:24:06.918 --> 01:24:08.118
He may just get it in his head

01:24:08.128 --> 01:24:09.796
to make himself at home for a while.

01:24:12.215 --> 01:24:14.134
Shoot. Can you please get that for me?

01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:16.803
Damn dog.

01:24:16.886 --> 01:24:20.306
Always tracking in God-knows-what from
who knows freaking where.

01:24:31.901 --> 01:24:35.739
And, he got into an altercation in his room
with a fellow.

01:24:35.822 --> 01:24:38.575
The fellow went over the balcony
and he's dead now.

01:24:38.658 --> 01:24:40.368
We haven't been able to ID the victim.

01:24:41.995 --> 01:24:43.496
That's crazy.

01:24:44.372 --> 01:24:45.582
What about Mr. Parmitt?

01:24:45.665 --> 01:24:48.585
We assume Mr. Parmitt was hurt pretty bad.

01:24:48.668 --> 01:24:52.130
He ran out of the hotel, stole a car.
No one's seen him since.

01:24:54.007 --> 01:24:56.509
Well, I guess I can kiss
that commission goodbye.

01:24:58.678 --> 01:25:00.847
They found your business card in his room.

01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:03.630
We don't know what he was into,

01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:05.477
but I just wanted to give you the heads-up.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:08.688
You know, if you come by the office later,
I could give you his application,

01:25:08.772 --> 01:25:10.523
and anything else you need, okay?

01:25:18.698 --> 01:25:20.450
You know, makes you realize how

01:25:20.533 --> 01:25:22.035
dangerous this business can be for a woman.

01:25:22.118 --> 01:25:24.329
I mean, I was in places all alone with him.

01:25:24.412 --> 01:25:26.206
I mean, he could've killed me.

01:25:33.296 --> 01:25:37.217
That's why it might be good if you started
thinking about not being alone anymore.

01:25:40.261 --> 01:25:41.387
Yeah.

01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:48.895
- Sorry to wake you up.
- No, it's okay.

01:25:50.939 --> 01:25:52.398
Thanks again.

01:26:02.075 --> 01:26:03.368
My God!

01:26:03.451 --> 01:26:05.495
My God! <i>Mi Dio!</i>
I can't believe he's not barking!

01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:06.538
Yeah, dogs like me.

01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:07.664
What do you need?

01:26:07.747 --> 01:26:08.915
Do I need to get you towels? My God.

01:26:08.998 --> 01:26:11.000
There's so much blood! What do you do
when there's so much blood?

01:26:11.084 --> 01:26:12.836
- Do you wash it? Do you not wash it?
- I need you to listen...

01:26:12.919 --> 01:26:14.170
- Do we put pressure on it? What do we do?
- Leslie!

01:26:14.254 --> 01:26:16.814
- Leslie, listen to me!
- Do we get a towel? Do we get a... What?

01:26:17.173 --> 01:26:21.219
Listen. Get dressed, get in your car,
find a pay phone, and call this number.

01:26:21.302 --> 01:26:23.096
Okay, okay, I can do that.

01:26:23.179 --> 01:26:24.639
Might not be an answer but maybe.

01:26:25.223 --> 01:26:26.808
Then go straight to work.

01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:28.226
- What?
- Yes.

01:26:28.309 --> 01:26:30.728
I can't leave you here!
We have to get you to a hospital!

01:26:30.812 --> 01:26:32.438
- You could die by the time I get back!
- Leslie!

01:26:32.564 --> 01:26:34.482
Leslie! Go.

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:36.484
Okay.

01:26:38.361 --> 01:26:40.572
Okay. Okay.

01:26:47.912 --> 01:26:50.456
So, Pipsy, you like this one?

01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:52.709
Can you make soup?

01:26:56.713 --> 01:27:00.133
Hi, my name is Leslie Rodgers.

01:27:00.216 --> 01:27:02.552
Daniel Parmitt asked me to call.

01:27:04.596 --> 01:27:05.638
Yes.

01:27:05.972 --> 01:27:08.224
Well, why don't you go ahead
and take a look at both places again

01:27:08.308 --> 01:27:10.018
before you make your final decision.

01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:12.163
Yeah, I could be there in a half hour.

01:27:12.645 --> 01:27:13.980
Okay. Bye.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.570
<i>My God!</i>

01:27:20.653 --> 01:27:22.655
<i>Is that a... That's a person!</i>

01:27:22.739 --> 01:27:24.198
<i>- My gosh!
- No!</i>

01:27:24.324 --> 01:27:25.658
<i>Did you see that?</i>

01:27:25.742 --> 01:27:28.077
That's so terrible.

01:27:28.161 --> 01:27:29.787
<i>Call 911!</i>

01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:35.335
You ladies have a great day!

01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:39.589
I thought that guy sounded like trouble.
I mean, Ecuador?

01:27:39.714 --> 01:27:41.382
Yeah. Just my luck.

01:27:41.466 --> 01:27:42.675
Are you okay?

01:27:43.801 --> 01:27:45.303
I'm going out.

01:27:45.845 --> 01:27:47.805
If anyone from the police comes,
just give 'em the list

01:27:47.889 --> 01:27:50.183
of places I showed Mr. Parmitt, okay?

01:27:51.017 --> 01:27:54.354
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I just... I just need some air.

01:28:09.243 --> 01:28:10.870
I was afraid you were the cops.

01:28:16.668 --> 01:28:19.545
What's going on? Are you a nurse?

01:28:21.089 --> 01:28:22.465
I'm Claire.

01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:28.096
- Leslie.
- Hi.

01:28:28.179 --> 01:28:29.973
I named her after Leslie on
The <i>Young</i> and the <i>Restless.</i>

01:28:30.056 --> 01:28:31.057
Mom.

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.476
<i>Her sister's named
after Jennifer in Valley of the Dolls.</i>

01:28:33.559 --> 01:28:35.061
They don't care, Ma!

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:39.065
I used to have a beauty salon,
and the TV was on all day.

01:28:39.899 --> 01:28:41.234
I told you to go back to work.

01:28:41.442 --> 01:28:44.988
I was, I did, I was... I left.

01:28:45.071 --> 01:28:47.824
I thought I was calling
somebody to take you to the hospital.

01:28:47.907 --> 01:28:51.077
I can't do that, Leslie.
I have something to do tonight.

01:28:51.327 --> 01:28:54.288
Are you crazy? You almost died!

01:28:55.248 --> 01:28:57.959
Wait. Well, you have a...
A mangled hand, a broken rib!

01:28:58.042 --> 01:28:59.252
Four this time.

01:28:59.419 --> 01:29:00.503
This is a real man.

01:29:00.586 --> 01:29:02.171
You're in no shape to do anything!

01:29:02.255 --> 01:29:04.007
You... You can barely even sit up!

01:29:07.301 --> 01:29:08.553
Would you tell him, please!

01:29:08.636 --> 01:29:10.013
I can't stop him.

01:29:10.513 --> 01:29:12.098
He is who he is.

01:29:14.851 --> 01:29:15.852
Okay...

01:29:17.478 --> 01:29:18.730
All set.

01:29:19.647 --> 01:29:21.858
Do you want me to call a
taxi or leave my car?

01:29:22.859 --> 01:29:23.985
I'll find a car.

01:29:24.277 --> 01:29:25.445
You're good at that.

01:29:26.362 --> 01:29:27.363
Claire...

01:29:28.156 --> 01:29:29.615
I didn't think you'd stay.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.661
I know.

01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:37.915
Will you wait for me at the fish camp?

01:29:39.083 --> 01:29:40.376
You know I will.

01:29:51.637 --> 01:29:55.141
Ascension, I've left a bag with his
clothes and some amoxicillin in it.

01:29:55.224 --> 01:29:56.350
Thank you.

01:29:57.685 --> 01:29:59.854
Thank you so much
for taking such good care of him.

01:29:59.937 --> 01:30:01.355
Please, it was nothing.

01:30:01.439 --> 01:30:03.399
- Please, please.
- Thank you. Bye.

01:30:03.483 --> 01:30:05.610
Come back to see me. Bye.

01:30:09.989 --> 01:30:11.532
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:30:17.663 --> 01:30:18.748
That cop,

01:30:18.831 --> 01:30:19.999
he's watching you.

01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:23.336
Go back to work.
When you come back, I'll be gone.

01:30:34.263 --> 01:30:37.767
All right.
Everyone gets a weapon and two extra clips.

01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:40.812
Carlson, you better be damn sure
that firehouse is empty.

01:30:40.895 --> 01:30:42.855
Relax. It's closed for renovation.

01:30:42.939 --> 01:30:44.857
Hardwicke, I'm giving you my best .45.

01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:46.192
Let's go!

01:31:13.553 --> 01:31:14.929
No one's gonna believe you're a fireman.

01:31:15.012 --> 01:31:16.931
Even volunteers cut their fucking hair.

01:31:17.014 --> 01:31:19.225
Now put your hood on before your jacket.
Show some discipline!

01:31:19.308 --> 01:31:20.977
Hey, he looks fine.

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:24.355
I'm more worried about
Hardwicke getting on that goddamn boat.

01:31:24.438 --> 01:31:25.773
Let's go! Come on!

01:32:06.314 --> 01:32:08.399
<i>Battalion 2 Division, 1-Rescue-33,</i>

01:32:08.482 --> 01:32:10.610
<i>stand by for additional instructions...</i>

01:32:26.292 --> 01:32:28.085
It's going to start at 12 million.

01:32:28.169 --> 01:32:30.379
- It's mine.
- Mother!

01:32:30.463 --> 01:32:32.465
- What?
- They'd look much better on me.

01:32:33.591 --> 01:32:35.760
These are too small.

01:32:36.552 --> 01:32:37.887
That's sensational.

01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:39.805
- It's beautiful!
- It's quite...

01:32:40.306 --> 01:32:43.726
<i>If you would all
please take your seats, we'll begin.</i>

01:32:43.851 --> 01:32:47.313
<i>We're here tonight
to celebrate my very dear friend...</i>

01:32:47.396 --> 01:32:49.148
<i>Miriam Hope Clendon.</i>

01:32:49.565 --> 01:32:54.153
<i>Let me introduce our celebrity
auctioneer, Lionel Flemming.</i>

01:32:58.699 --> 01:33:00.743
<i>Hello and welcome.</i>

01:33:01.118 --> 01:33:03.246
<i>We're here tonight to pay tribute</i>

01:33:03.329 --> 01:33:06.916
<i>to one of the great daughters
of Palm Beach society...</i>

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.293
<i>Miriam Hope Clendon.</i>

01:33:10.086 --> 01:33:13.714
<i>Her kind works and noble spirit...</i>

01:33:26.811 --> 01:33:28.020
Come on.

01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:43.995
- Talk to me.
- Good to go.

01:33:44.078 --> 01:33:45.621
We're on. Let's go.

01:33:56.882 --> 01:33:59.302
Keep moving! Let's go! Come on!

01:34:06.475 --> 01:34:07.810
Clear out!

01:34:07.893 --> 01:34:10.438
All right, everybody, move!
Move away from the building!

01:34:10.521 --> 01:34:12.481
There's tens of millions of dollars
worth of jewels in there!

01:34:12.565 --> 01:34:13.649
We'll handle this, sir!

01:34:13.733 --> 01:34:15.943
Officer! Get everyone away from the door!

01:34:16.027 --> 01:34:17.747
- Building's empty!
- Do not let anybody in!

01:34:17.778 --> 01:34:19.238
These fumes are toxic!

01:34:19.322 --> 01:34:20.656
- You!
- Yes, sir?

01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:22.867
I want you to form
a perimeter around this building.

01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:25.411
Nobody gets in here but my guys! Move!

01:34:25.745 --> 01:34:27.496
Cleared out. Lock these doors.

01:34:28.831 --> 01:34:30.374
Locking it up!

01:34:53.439 --> 01:34:54.440
Hey!

01:34:55.441 --> 01:34:56.484
All right.

01:35:01.447 --> 01:35:02.740
Hardwicke's on his way.

01:35:02.823 --> 01:35:03.908
Time to go!

01:35:06.327 --> 01:35:08.245
Let's go! Time to go!

01:35:08.329 --> 01:35:09.330
Right behind you!

01:35:10.873 --> 01:35:12.458
We got two minutes to get underwater!

01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:16.003
Come on. Let's go!

01:35:22.009 --> 01:35:24.053
<i>This is the Palm Beach County Sheriff.</i>

01:35:24.136 --> 01:35:26.430
<i>You have entered a restricted area.</i>

01:35:26.514 --> 01:35:28.182
<i>Please move away at once.</i>

01:35:29.767 --> 01:35:31.727
What the hell is he doing?
Does he realize...

01:35:31.811 --> 01:35:33.896
Sir, there's smoke in the building.
Is there a fire?

01:35:33.979 --> 01:35:36.899
Yes, there is a fire. The fire department's
there. They're taking care of it.

01:35:36.982 --> 01:35:38.150
Hey, what's going on?

01:35:38.234 --> 01:35:39.693
Go on the east side.

01:35:46.158 --> 01:35:47.576
Excuse me.

01:35:49.453 --> 01:35:51.664
Guys, the West Palm Beach department...

01:35:51.747 --> 01:35:53.249
West Palm? How did they beat us here?

01:35:53.332 --> 01:35:54.417
Well, they're already in there!

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.668
See anything?

01:35:59.755 --> 01:36:02.675
Everybody out of the building?
All the guests, out!

01:36:06.762 --> 01:36:09.557
I told you once, I need you to
leave this area right now,

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:10.641
or I will impound...

01:36:10.724 --> 01:36:13.185
- Break the glass.
- Stand back and let us do our job.

01:36:14.353 --> 01:36:15.604
Two more fire trucks just showed up.

01:36:15.688 --> 01:36:16.856
Hey, look at this dickhead!

01:36:19.859 --> 01:36:23.612
I'm not going to tell you again.
You need to leave the area.

01:36:23.696 --> 01:36:24.905
Do you understand me?

01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:27.783
- Sorry, sir. Sorry about that.
- Thank you.

01:36:27.867 --> 01:36:30.035
- Have a good night, man.
- Be safe.

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:33.122
Hey, Cap, got a West Palm helmet.

01:36:33.205 --> 01:36:35.325
- I got another one.
- Put them down, that's evidence.

01:36:35.332 --> 01:36:36.542
This is a robbery.

01:36:36.834 --> 01:36:37.918
No, God.

01:36:38.002 --> 01:36:39.628
My God!

01:36:40.546 --> 01:36:43.299
<i>One-nine-five.
Prepare to lock down the island.</i>

01:36:43.716 --> 01:36:47.928
<i>Secure the bridges, get units on both sides
of the island, set up a perimeter.</i>

01:36:48.721 --> 01:36:50.806
<i>Marine units, lntracoastal and beachside.</i>

01:36:50.890 --> 01:36:55.227
<i>Eagles One and Two, get visual of the
bridges. K-9, you're going to track from...</i>

01:36:56.061 --> 01:36:57.813
<i>Eagle One in position at North Bridge.</i>

01:36:57.897 --> 01:37:00.983
<i>I have visual of all three
bridges in "Up" position.</i>

01:37:01.066 --> 01:37:02.318
What's going on?

01:37:25.925 --> 01:37:29.261
<i>Eagle Two checking pleasure boat moorings
on the lntracoastal.</i>

01:37:52.451 --> 01:37:53.953
<i>Eagle One. I see an outlet.</i>

01:37:54.036 --> 01:37:56.664
<i>We need units to Worth Avenue
and South County Road.</i>

01:37:56.747 --> 01:37:58.123
Driver's license, ma'am, please.

01:37:58.207 --> 01:37:59.917
Is this your current address?

01:38:02.294 --> 01:38:04.171
It's really happening.

01:38:08.801 --> 01:38:11.178
Damn it! I'm not going
to let you fuck this up!

01:38:15.599 --> 01:38:16.809
Fuck.

01:38:54.179 --> 01:38:55.514
We did it!

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.904
Did you see the look
on those rich bitches' faces?

01:39:11.238 --> 01:39:12.781
Yeah! They were freaked!

01:39:12.865 --> 01:39:14.825
- Tell me about it.
- Keep it down till we get inside.

01:39:14.908 --> 01:39:16.452
They shit their Depends!

01:39:16.535 --> 01:39:18.495
No, she was just looking at your puss.

01:39:18.829 --> 01:39:20.150
You saw the way they waved us in?

01:39:20.164 --> 01:39:21.999
- Plan a job right...
- Beautiful!

01:39:22.958 --> 01:39:24.543
Smooth as a baby's ass!

01:39:24.627 --> 01:39:26.629
Firemen are heroes, baby.

01:39:27.046 --> 01:39:28.797
The public loves us.

01:39:28.881 --> 01:39:30.966
The public loves us!

01:39:31.258 --> 01:39:34.053
Hey, man, who wants a beer?
Time to celebrate.

01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:46.273
All right, let's check it out.

01:39:46.357 --> 01:39:48.067
All right. What you got?

01:39:49.068 --> 01:39:51.945
See what we got, baby.
Let's see what we got! Yeah!

01:39:52.029 --> 01:39:53.364
Wait just a goddamn minute!

01:39:53.614 --> 01:39:55.115
I want to see that ice.

01:39:56.367 --> 01:39:58.619
- Yes, yes!
- Lookit. Yeah, bubba.

01:39:58.702 --> 01:39:59.870
Give me one of those.

01:39:59.953 --> 01:40:01.830
- Yeah, beer.
- Beer and jewels, baby.

01:40:01.914 --> 01:40:03.082
What you got, Ross?

01:40:03.165 --> 01:40:04.458
Yeah, what you got? Let me see.

01:40:04.541 --> 01:40:06.502
Check it out. Look at that.

01:40:06.585 --> 01:40:08.462
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:40:08.587 --> 01:40:10.089
- Mama, we are rich!
- Beautiful.

01:40:11.131 --> 01:40:12.174
Who the fuck are you?

01:40:12.257 --> 01:40:13.342
Who the fuck are you?

01:40:13.425 --> 01:40:15.135
I'm a real estate agent!
My name is Leslie Rodgers!

01:40:15.219 --> 01:40:17.096
I just came by to see
if the house is still vacant!

01:40:17.179 --> 01:40:20.307
Get inside. Get inside!
Get the fuck inside.

01:40:20.391 --> 01:40:21.850
Hey, guys!

01:40:21.934 --> 01:40:23.060
Look what I found!

01:40:23.143 --> 01:40:25.437
Can someone tell me who the fuck is she?

01:40:26.271 --> 01:40:28.816
Where did she come from, Hardwicke?

01:40:28.899 --> 01:40:30.234
Why the hell did you bring her in here?

01:40:30.317 --> 01:40:31.997
She was peeking
through the fucking window!

01:40:32.027 --> 01:40:33.320
No, I was checking to see

01:40:33.404 --> 01:40:34.655
- if the house was still empty!
- Sit down! Sit!

01:40:34.738 --> 01:40:36.156
Calm down, calm down, everybody.
Calm down.

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.640
- Shut up!
- You can call my boss...

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:38.867
Shut up!

01:40:44.456 --> 01:40:45.541
Know what I'm thinking?

01:40:45.624 --> 01:40:46.583
What?

01:40:46.667 --> 01:40:48.210
- Parker.
- No.

01:40:48.293 --> 01:40:49.545
It's not fucking Parker!

01:40:49.628 --> 01:40:50.629
You're being paranoid again!

01:40:50.713 --> 01:40:51.797
He sent her in!

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.048
He's out there somewhere!

01:40:53.132 --> 01:40:54.591
I don't know anybody named Parker!

01:40:54.675 --> 01:40:57.010
Shut your fucking hole! Shut up!

01:40:58.262 --> 01:40:59.763
Parker's gotta be hurting bad.

01:40:59.847 --> 01:41:01.890
He leaked a whole gallon of blood
up in that hotel.

01:41:01.974 --> 01:41:03.642
The news said he could barely walk.

01:41:03.726 --> 01:41:05.310
That motherfucker's a rock, man.

01:41:05.394 --> 01:41:06.937
My God, my God.

01:41:08.105 --> 01:41:10.441
That nine-life son of a fucking bitch!

01:41:11.150 --> 01:41:12.609
Move! Where is he?

01:41:12.901 --> 01:41:14.903
- No!
- Where the fuck is he?

01:41:14.987 --> 01:41:16.905
Tell me where he is,
or I'll shoot you in the fucking face!

01:41:16.989 --> 01:41:18.699
I don't know! I swear!

01:41:19.783 --> 01:41:20.951
Let go of me!

01:41:21.034 --> 01:41:23.245
Do you want every cop in the world here?

01:41:23.328 --> 01:41:24.496
All right.

01:41:24.955 --> 01:41:26.415
All right.

01:41:26.582 --> 01:41:28.167
All right, get the fuck off me!

01:41:33.255 --> 01:41:35.924
You're all right. Here, let me help you.

01:41:36.842 --> 01:41:40.471
You're all right.
Come on, now, gonna sit down and talk.

01:41:45.517 --> 01:41:47.728
It's okay. Now, listen to me.

01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:50.606
You don't want to die, do you?

01:41:52.441 --> 01:41:53.692
- Do you?
- No.

01:41:55.569 --> 01:41:57.404
Then tell me where he is.

01:41:59.615 --> 01:42:01.033
I don't know.

01:42:05.454 --> 01:42:07.581
Check the house. Every inch!

01:42:25.307 --> 01:42:26.892
You know who those belong to?

01:42:27.601 --> 01:42:29.895
No. I don't have any idea.

01:42:31.730 --> 01:42:33.106
Yeah, you do.

01:43:26.827 --> 01:43:28.787
What's your connection with Parker?

01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:31.623
Are you fucking him?

01:43:33.166 --> 01:43:35.419
What? You want to hit me now?

01:43:37.087 --> 01:43:39.423
Go ahead. You first.

01:43:40.716 --> 01:43:42.009
Then it's my turn.

01:44:00.319 --> 01:44:02.279
Hey, it's clear on this side.

01:44:02.988 --> 01:44:04.656
He isn't on this side either.

01:44:06.909 --> 01:44:08.410
Where's...

01:44:09.328 --> 01:44:10.454
Ross?

01:44:12.497 --> 01:44:13.624
Ross?

01:44:15.167 --> 01:44:16.460
Fuck!

01:44:17.002 --> 01:44:18.295
Shit.

01:44:19.630 --> 01:44:20.881
Shit.

01:44:22.549 --> 01:44:23.926
Go check it out.

01:44:24.384 --> 01:44:25.469
Me? No fucking way am I...

01:44:25.552 --> 01:44:26.762
- Check!
- Fuck!

01:44:26.845 --> 01:44:28.680
Get the fucking gun out of my face!

01:44:31.683 --> 01:44:34.144
Stop pointing the fucking gun at me!
I'm fucking going.

01:44:34.227 --> 01:44:36.021
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:44:39.858 --> 01:44:41.193
If she moves, shoot her!

01:44:47.449 --> 01:44:51.161
Why don't we just unbutton
this fucking button right here?

01:44:52.704 --> 01:44:54.039
Yeah.

01:44:58.460 --> 01:44:59.962
Let me see what you got.

01:45:00.587 --> 01:45:01.588
Bitch!

01:45:01.672 --> 01:45:03.173
I'm going to fuck you, and then you die!

01:45:03.256 --> 01:45:04.466
In your dreams, you fat ugly fuck!

01:45:04.549 --> 01:45:05.592
Fuck you, motherfuck...

01:45:05.676 --> 01:45:06.802
Shut the fuck up!

01:45:07.219 --> 01:45:09.304
Shut your hole and pay attention!

01:45:12.641 --> 01:45:13.850
God damn it!

01:45:13.934 --> 01:45:14.935
Ross!

01:45:22.818 --> 01:45:24.903
Parker, we've got the girl!

01:45:25.487 --> 01:45:26.571
You better come out,

01:45:26.655 --> 01:45:28.407
unless you want to see her dead!

01:45:31.451 --> 01:45:32.661
Parker?

01:45:39.584 --> 01:45:40.919
What the fuck are you doing?

01:45:44.172 --> 01:45:45.340
You bitch!

01:45:58.270 --> 01:46:00.188
You're fucking dead!

01:46:37.059 --> 01:46:38.226
Parker!

01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:40.395
You touch me
and Danzinger will hunt you down!

01:46:40.479 --> 01:46:41.897
He won't rest until you're dead!

01:46:42.022 --> 01:46:43.732
Listen to me! We can split this up.

01:46:43.815 --> 01:46:45.150
We'll use my connections.

01:46:48.653 --> 01:46:51.073
Do not make me fucking kill her!

01:46:51.156 --> 01:46:52.824
- My God!
- You understand?

01:46:53.492 --> 01:46:54.659
Go ahead.

01:46:55.202 --> 01:46:57.579
- I will shoot her! Shut the fuck up!
- No! Don't let him kill me!

01:46:57.662 --> 01:46:59.247
I will shoot her in the fucking head!

01:46:59.331 --> 01:47:00.874
Don't let him kill me!

01:47:00.957 --> 01:47:02.084
Go ahead.

01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:09.674
Fuck! Let me... Let me explain.

01:47:10.008 --> 01:47:13.595
You were supposed to torch the hay
bales behind the livestock pavilion.

01:47:26.316 --> 01:47:28.401
- Come on!
- Wait. Not so fast.

01:47:30.153 --> 01:47:31.404
You shouldn't have come here.

01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:33.281
I thought you might need help.

01:47:33.365 --> 01:47:36.451
And what happened? Did you know
that guy's gun wouldn't go off?

01:47:36.535 --> 01:47:38.703
When I broke in the night
you followed me...

01:47:38.787 --> 01:47:41.206
I bent the firing pins
on most of their weapons.

01:47:43.708 --> 01:47:45.210
Most of them?

01:48:08.191 --> 01:48:10.110
Here's what's gonna happen.

01:48:10.652 --> 01:48:12.487
Take the jewels to your office...

01:48:13.196 --> 01:48:15.407
Find an AC vent, open it, and stuff 'em in.

01:48:15.490 --> 01:48:17.691
- Put the grating back on and forget about it.
- Butâ€œ.

01:48:17.742 --> 01:48:19.369
You don't tell your mother
and you don't check on them

01:48:19.452 --> 01:48:20.912
to make sure they're still there.

01:48:22.956 --> 01:48:26.793
In about three months,
I'll send someone in to get them from you.

01:48:28.295 --> 01:48:30.338
Might take a long time to fence,
but after that's done,

01:48:30.422 --> 01:48:32.299
you'll receive your share by express mail.

01:48:36.970 --> 01:48:38.889
You can't put that money in a bank, Leslie.

01:48:41.099 --> 01:48:43.768
You can't go on a crazy shopping spree.

01:48:47.022 --> 01:48:48.023
Okay.

01:48:48.899 --> 01:48:51.943
But... How much will it...

01:48:52.110 --> 01:48:55.780
I get the first two hundred thousand.
My original share.

01:48:56.448 --> 01:49:00.994
The next two hundred thousand,
goes to my old partner who planned the job.

01:49:02.746 --> 01:49:04.623
Then we split the rest.

01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:08.001
How much?

01:49:10.295 --> 01:49:12.839
With the right buyer,
your share will be millions.

01:49:23.308 --> 01:49:25.310
Sorry! I'm sorry-

01:49:26.686 --> 01:49:28.563
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:49:33.068 --> 01:49:35.695
What? Wait, wait, wait!
Where are you going?

01:49:37.822 --> 01:49:40.992
I'm going to lie low for a week or so
until things calm down.

01:49:42.327 --> 01:49:44.329
I'll have someone drive in and get me.

01:49:47.415 --> 01:49:48.625
Claire?

01:49:55.173 --> 01:49:57.008
I never did have a chance, did I?

01:50:51.855 --> 01:50:52.856
Danzinger?

01:50:53.106 --> 01:50:54.316
Yeah.

01:50:57.235 --> 01:50:59.029
Who the hell are you?

01:50:59.696 --> 01:51:00.905
Parker.

01:51:08.079 --> 01:51:09.831
All right. All right.

01:51:09.914 --> 01:51:13.501
I was going to give them
20 cents on the dollar. I'll give you 40.

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:15.420
It's not about money.

01:51:34.064 --> 01:51:35.065
Leslie!

01:51:35.148 --> 01:51:36.441
I got it.

01:51:43.656 --> 01:51:44.657
Morning.

01:51:44.741 --> 01:51:46.284
Sign, please.

01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:48.370
- It's heavy.
- Okay.

01:52:02.467 --> 01:52:03.510
My...

01:52:03.593 --> 01:52:05.011
Leslie, who was that?

01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:08.390
It's the mailman!

01:52:09.557 --> 01:52:11.226
Nothing but bills!

01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:20.985
We have received bounties from heaven.

01:52:21.653 --> 01:52:25.824
Like a new house,
plenty of money to pay off all our debts.

01:52:26.783 --> 01:52:30.453
You know, I believe that man that we found
on the side of the road that day,

01:52:30.537 --> 01:52:32.247
he wasn't no man at all.

01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:34.999
He was an angel, sent here to test us.
