02:01.720 --> 02:06.009
There was a time
I knew everything in the sky.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.329
Every satellite...

02:08.560 --> 02:10.687
every constellation...

02:10.880 --> 02:13.690
souvenirs of space walks
and astronauts...

02:13.880 --> 02:17.009
and rockets launched by NASA
in the '60s.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.564
As a kid, I looked up
and felt the future.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.768
It belonged to me.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.529
Hey, hey, man, check this out.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.000
Then 2008 happened.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.247
Budgets crashed.

02:44.440 --> 02:47.330
NASA was just another business
looking for cash.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.164
The billionaires took over.

02:49.360 --> 02:54.491
Satellite pirates with deep pockets,
drunk with the idea of ruling the world.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.449
I left the military and took a job
with the biggest billionaire of them all.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.962
Carson Welch. I went to the gray side.

03:03.960 --> 03:08.249
Messed up bad in Kabul, Afghanistan,
broke about 18 bones in two legs.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.522
Lost my gig.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.882
For a year, I waited for scraps...

03:13.080 --> 03:17.130
like a hungry cat
outside a seafood restaurant dumpster.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.722
Finally, I got a crappy second chance.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.810
- At least I was going back to Hawaii.
- Woody.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.446
Just wanted to say hello
before we landed.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.130
How you doing?

03:36.440 --> 03:39.011
How's the contractor job going?
Miss the uniform?

03:40.360 --> 03:41.725
Sometimes.

03:41.920 --> 03:45.527
Heard you popped your balloons
in Afghanistan. Thought you were dead.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.324
I'm excited about this gig.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.126
I'm delivering a blessing
on a pedestrian gate.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.365
Only in Hawaii, huh?

03:55.560 --> 03:58.131
- Below the aloha exterior.
- Casablanca, baby.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.684
Tracy's gonna flip out
when she sees you.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.728
- Colonel Lacy?
- Yes, sir.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.605
Are you aware
of the so-called Arrival myth?

04:15.280 --> 04:17.089
- What's that?
- The calendars say...

04:17.279 --> 04:21.046
that this week is the return
of the playful Hawaiian god Lono...

04:21.279 --> 04:24.841
and he will wreak havoc in the sky
with the fire goddess Pele.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.405
Mitchell? Hey. Okay.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.080
Sorry. Sorry. He's a Hawaiian-myth buff.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.645
Yeah, of course he is.

04:30.840 --> 04:34.287
All right, Mitchell, be cool.
Relax and enjoy a bitching summer.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.562
Make love not war, huh?

04:37.120 --> 04:39.487
- Morning, captain.
- Morning, airman.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.850
Good to go.

05:13.640 --> 05:17.531
Well, shit. Looks like we're down
to dwindling resources, huh?

05:17.720 --> 05:21.042
Colonel, I'm here to save you,
you great white obsolete whale.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.686
After Kabul,
I'm surprised you can make a joke.

05:23.920 --> 05:28.403
- Can I be honest? You look terrible.
- I've missed your psychotic hands.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.484
Good times. When's the last time
we worked together?

05:31.720 --> 05:33.688
- Silent Reaper?
- Jesus. Silent Reaper?

05:33.880 --> 05:35.484
Yeah. It's been a while.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.809
- How's your life?
- I got no life. You're my life, Fingers.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.048
"You're my life, colonel."
Nobody calls me Fingers anymore.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.210
I'm a big old deal around here.
Got my name on the wall.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.966
I'm so powerful,
I'm erect just thinking about it.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.884
Present arms!

05:55.360 --> 05:58.125
Of course, the old ex-girlfriend.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.002
Pause for the memories.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.283
She handles all these ceremonies
around here now.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.688
All right, Gilcrest, I want to introduce you
to your Air Force liaison. A fast burner.

06:26.880 --> 06:32.171
F-22 pilot on loan to Space Command
for "career broadening." Yep.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.762
Decorated two years ahead of schedule.
General Dixon's favorite.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.883
Meet your watchdog.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.491
Enjoy.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.365
Captain Allison Ng, sir.
I know you have a meeting.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.642
I'll take us on a flyby of the island.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.326
I'd like to take you
through how this is gonna work.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.922
Hey! I refuse to talk to you.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.851
Well, you just broke that promise.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.606
Are you okay?

06:58.800 --> 07:01.724
So good. Super, super good.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.122
Woody never told me you were coming.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.091
- He never tells me anything.
- Sir, if I may?

07:07.320 --> 07:08.810
- He talked to me.
- Oh, yeah?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.207
- Yeah.
- Because you're not married to him.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.801
Hey, I called you five times last year.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.731
- I was worried about you.
- You still in Forensics?

07:16.920 --> 07:19.605
I'm head of the department.
I make my own hours.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.087
Will you stop getting more beautiful?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.526
An awkward silence lasts four seconds.
I'll end this in three.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.449
Sir? If I may?

07:29.640 --> 07:32.291
- You've gotta meet my kids.
- Yeah.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.844
I'll be right back, captain.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.849
Don't get lost now.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.805
Never. Sir.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.691
Tracy. Tracy. Tracy.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.201
- I got my bag.
- Oh, so sorry.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.729
Mitch. Mitch,
come out of the flag, please.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.446
I want to introduce you
to Brian Gilcrest.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.687
- Pleasure. Hey.
- Hey.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.491
- Mitchell is 10 and Gracie's 12.
- Gracie. Brian.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.809
- Brian and I haven't seen each other in...
- About 13 years.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.731
Thirteen years. Right.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.930
- Dad.
- There you are.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.088
- Hey, Dad.
- You're back.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.083
There she is.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.127
- Are you the Arrival?
- No.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.607
But in five days, sadly,
I'm the departure.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.523
There's a blessing we're gonna
take care of on the new gate.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.087
Gilcrest. Carson. Come on.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.525
You know the deal.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.927
Myths and bones and ghosts.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.120
Well, hey,
why don't you come for dinner?

08:44.320 --> 08:46.607
- Say yes.
- This week?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.771
Say yes.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.806
- Come on.
- All right.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.801
- I'd love to.
- Yeah? Great.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.925
The house across the street from
the Officers' Club. It's the corner house.

09:00.120 --> 09:03.249
So good. Super, super good. Okay.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.165
Are you familiar
with the Hawaiian god Lono?

09:09.840 --> 09:12.207
- No.
- In the Arrival myth, he saves Pele...

09:12.440 --> 09:14.329
the Hawaiian goddess...

09:14.520 --> 09:18.002
Look forward to hearing the rest
at dinner. Thanks for the lift.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.525
- For you.
- Yes.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.125
Yes, yes, yes.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.081
This is very important for our book.
I wanna hear about your childhood.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.520
Childhood.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.405
That's nostalgia and a trap.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.524
Carson, the new king
of space exploration.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.802
Aloha, boys.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.890
I saw your TED Talk on the way.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.523
Oh, that.
Yeah, Bono talked me into that.

10:04.720 --> 10:05.767
Oh, how is Bono?

10:06.400 --> 10:09.085
As if I knew him. That's...

10:09.280 --> 10:11.521
Everybody wants to launch a rocket.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.121
Right. Sure.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.887
Good at that.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.246
Smooth.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.563
Smooth.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.201
It's good to be back.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.927
Oh, God.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.761
I didn't abandon you.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.849
I saved you.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.924
Let's do some great stuff here.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.327
All right, start with the blessing,
and we'll move on from there.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.965
Okay.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.527
And welcome back.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.083
Killed it.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.691
Oahu traffic, Seneca 128.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.565
Alpha-Romeo over Rabbit island,
2000 feet.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.922
Our appointment
with the sovereign king...

11:09.120 --> 11:13.205
and the head of the state of Hawaii,
Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele, was rejected.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.161
He's a fierce man, sir. He's a descendant
of King Kamehameha the Great.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.528
I know Bumpy. I helped him get elected.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.566
We've all worked together before.
And you don't have to call me "sir."

11:23.760 --> 11:27.287
Sir, I will also be an invaluable addition
to our joint mission.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.482
I am a quarter Hawaiian.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.881
Call me "sir."

11:37.560 --> 11:41.042
The Royal Aloha. Careful on those steps.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.049
- I see them.
- I know about the leg.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.481
Sir, I'd love to get a beverage.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.286
Or a peppermint tea.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.161
And discuss all kinds of stuff.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.887
The sky. The future. Yeah.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.607
Everything.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.010
- I'm a peppermint-tea girl.
- You have a good time.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.242
- I meant with you.
- Captain Ring, I...

12:04.440 --> 12:07.922
it's Ng. It's like "ring,"
but without the R or the I.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.605
It's just Ng. It's short.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.529
Short. Short's good.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.769
Small talk and conversation, Ng.
There's no time for it.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.606
You are never going to offend me
by being blunt.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.922
Handful of words, boiled down.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.930
No more than five.
One, two, three, four...

12:23.120 --> 12:24.724
- Five. Yeah.
- There you go.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.161
Let this be our longest conversation.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.443
Good evening, captain.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.161
Warmest aloha, sir.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.969
Okay, let's talk about Gilcrest.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.328
So finally we meet, right?

12:48.800 --> 12:50.006
This is a great story.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.289
This is good. Yeah.

12:53.480 --> 12:57.041
So much paperwork on this guy.
A surprising amount of paperwork.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.449
Flirting with Pakistani princesses.
Yeah, yeah.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.769
Something with the daughter
of Princess Hafa El Yassein.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.850
- He got married and divorced...
- I lived a full life.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.883
...from a fake heiress.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.003
Oh, yeah. Homegirl took him down.

13:13.600 --> 13:17.002
But before that all came apart,
there was greatness in this guy.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.043
Oh, now you're gonna compliment me?

13:19.240 --> 13:21.481
He's got kind of...

13:22.120 --> 13:23.849
like a chilly presence.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.526
Like, you look into his eyes
and it's miles of blue.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.291
He's just a brilliant...

13:32.640 --> 13:36.440
compelling, innovative...

13:38.520 --> 13:39.726
commanding...

13:39.960 --> 13:41.121
Stop it.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.166
...fricking wreck of a guy.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.971
He's like a...

13:48.160 --> 13:50.208
A sad city coyote.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.930
You know?

13:54.040 --> 13:57.761
- Okay. I love you too, Mom.
- A great relation with your mother.

13:57.960 --> 14:01.885
Hey, look up at 10:37 tonight because
there is a Jupiter-moon conjunction...

14:02.080 --> 14:03.764
that you will not wanna miss.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.291
Okay, good night.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.961
A double espresso.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.204
Morning, sir. I'm so jacked for today.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.845
Make that a triple.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.651
Thank you for the camaraderie, sir.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.450
- I didn't say anything, captain.
- No, it's your manner.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.282
I find your manner very down-to-earth.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.884
You have links to the National
Reconnaissance Office, don't you?

14:32.080 --> 14:35.243
Even if I was NRO, captain,
I couldn't tell you, but I'm not.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.204
You were trained top to bottom...

14:37.400 --> 14:39.971
on every aspect
of maintaining these birds.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.685
How did you end up supervising
a gate blessing? If I may.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.249
I'm sad.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.849
You were listening?

15:08.280 --> 15:10.965
I mean, honey...
I'm not even a guy who says "honey."

15:11.160 --> 15:13.845
...you got a baritone built for Broadway.
- Shit.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.044
- Oh, shoot. Shoot, shoot, shit.
- Well, which is it?

15:17.240 --> 15:20.562
- Is it "shit" or "shoot"?
- I am deeply offended by myself, sir.

15:20.760 --> 15:23.525
Let me ease you off
the shit-shoot mountain, captain.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.803
I work for Global One.
Carson Welch is a private citizen...

15:27.000 --> 15:30.368
who outfits struggling countries
with communications and freedom.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.369
Private citizen?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.767
Communications and freedom?

15:35.880 --> 15:38.281
- I'll withhold my comment, sir.
- Good.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.362
Don't text your father about the washer,
honey. He's in Kuwait.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.847
Why is he always in the places
where the war is over?

15:47.040 --> 15:48.530
Oh, I don't know, sweetie.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.809
That's why your mom takes long walks.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.971
Mitchell, time to put the camera down
and join the land of the living here.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.208
What's different about you, Mom?

15:58.400 --> 16:00.641
Your bad mood's not convincing.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.370
Okay, drink water, not soda,
and I don't want you to eat too late.

16:06.560 --> 16:10.770
Gracie, work on your formal dress like
we talked about. Mitchell, camera down.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.327
Next sign of the Arrival:

16:15.520 --> 16:19.161
Ancient Hawaiian spirits
begin to appear.

16:40.520 --> 16:44.445
This place has a lot of mana.
That's Hawaiian for...

16:44.640 --> 16:47.211
I know what it means, captain.
Power and spirit.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.928
- We're stuck.
- No, we're not. I know a shortcut.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.210
- Yeah?
- Right up that hill.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.971
- Can you make that, captain?
- Oh, I can make that.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.570
Do you need help?

17:03.760 --> 17:05.444
Watch your step.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.087
Do I need help?

17:07.280 --> 17:09.407
Super good, captain.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.522
Super, super good.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.769
- Captain.
- Yes?

17:36.960 --> 17:41.170
When we get to the Kingdom, I'm gonna
need Bumpy all to myself, you know that.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.249
It'll be a beautiful dance, sir.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.044
You know, I was once a dancer.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.801
- I broke my tibia. Joined the Air Force.
- Yeah, well, I dance alone.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.725
I'll back you up.
We all work together. It's life.

17:51.960 --> 17:55.362
We got three wars going on right now.
We're not in Coachella...

17:55.560 --> 17:59.007
waiting for the Molly to kick in
so we can writhe in the mud...

17:59.200 --> 18:02.727
and wait for Tupac's hologram
to come on and make us feel things.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.524
- Understood.
- Good.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.451
You're cynical. I get it. I really do.

18:07.640 --> 18:12.771
Call it what you will, captain. I go hard,
I go deep, sometimes, I break things.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.564
Okay?

18:15.760 --> 18:17.285
- Okay.
- There will come a point...

18:17.480 --> 18:20.563
I'm gonna give you a look.
That means it's Brian's time.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.000
Who's Brian?

18:22.240 --> 18:24.288
I'm Brian!

18:28.520 --> 18:31.171
"Miles of blue," remember?

18:31.880 --> 18:34.167
You never had a partner?

18:34.560 --> 18:37.166
I know your ex-wife gave you
the heave a year ago.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.763
Hey. That'd be off-limits repartee for us,
captain. I lone-wolfed it all the way.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.327
- That's who I am. End of speech.
- Understood.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.370
By the way,
my ex-spouse did not give me the heave.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.766
She met some rich guy
who sold comic books...

18:50.960 --> 18:53.440
and in this economy,
that's enough to vaporize a marriage.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.405
You get replaced
by a comic-book version of yourself.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.446
Nobody wants to live where they are.
They wanna be in a fantasy. All right?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.165
She gave me the heave.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.004
Boy, did she blow it.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.371
- If I may. And you have to know that.
- I know what you're doing.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.483
You're not gonna pick my brains.
They're unpickable.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.969
And your attempt to get under my hood
and ask barbed questions is, frankly...

19:31.120 --> 19:32.770
Fantastic.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.084
Thank you.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.324
What is that?

19:42.280 --> 19:44.886
I'm tempted to say menehune.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.361
They're like Hawaiian leprechauns.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.649
Or chipmunks. It's something.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.486
There is a lot of mana up here.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.485
Upside-down flag.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.371
Symbol of a nation in distress.
We're here.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.007
Nice shortcut, by the way.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.050
Who this?

20:23.960 --> 20:27.009
- You lost?
- Afternoon. Here to see the king.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.924
You can stop right there.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.491
We're...

20:31.240 --> 20:32.844
I'm Brian Gilcrest.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.171
That name will carry weight
with the king.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.285
No?

20:50.080 --> 20:51.570
There he is.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.210
Love of country.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.328
So, you're a paycheck warrior now.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.410
Plaything of billionaires,
in bed with the military.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.841
I just need a little help.
This is Captain Ng.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.045
- Aloha, Captain Ng.
- Aloha.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.049
Heard you blew up in Afghanistan.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.288
You looked better when you were younger.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.767
- Oh, thank you.
- So pale now.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.843
Keith Richards looks like a teenager
next to you.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.246
Okay. Okay.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.967
One year, I went out and played poker.
Didn't do anything else.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.607
Like, maybe five, six years ago.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.609
First game was on a military base.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.849
This black guy,
could've been 20-something years old...

21:35.320 --> 21:38.881
and I'm like all anti-military, U.S.,
the whole thing, right?

21:39.080 --> 21:42.004
He comes to me and goes,
"Uncle, you like warm water?"

21:42.200 --> 21:46.410
And I go, "Right on, brother."

21:46.600 --> 21:50.605
And that was it. That changed
my whole turn on military.

21:50.800 --> 21:56.762
So a military? Bigtime respect for them
when they're doing the right things.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.002
It's an honor to be here.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.489
It's just a budget thing, Bumpy.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.524
We're combining two bases
and moving the pedestrian gate...

22:04.760 --> 22:08.810
and you can move the bones wherever,
not one tibia will be out of place.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.162
We just need a 20-minute blessing.

22:11.760 --> 22:16.402
My people respect you, and they want
your approval for the community.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.802
- Carson Welch is...
- Sir...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.843
Your people are crooks.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.806
Children of white missionary
that stole our country in 1893. You get it.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.403
Bumpy, mohe, my old friend,
this is your nation, but we are in America.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.568
Yeah, under military occupation.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.489
You're on the wrong side, brah.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.646
You hungry?

22:38.840 --> 22:41.730
Great to see you. Aloha.

22:46.760 --> 22:47.807
Come on, brah.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.125
The word is,
something big coming through.

22:51.320 --> 22:54.767
Gonna threaten the whole world.
Something in the sky.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.041
Weapons, maybe.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.844
- Don't know anything about that.
- No. No, king.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.281
- Captain.
- That would be a violation...

23:02.520 --> 23:04.966
of the Outer Space Peace Treaty of 1967.

23:05.720 --> 23:11.170
The sky belongs to no one country
and no weapons shall exist in the sky.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.843
The sky is sacred.
The shelter over all of us.

23:17.480 --> 23:22.202
Working for the military here,
I am authorized to offer the Kingdom this.

23:22.400 --> 23:26.200
Fourteen agriculturally-perfect acres
on the other side of this mountain.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.084
Now, Sunday...

23:30.160 --> 23:32.003
Sunday at 10, we swing a ceremony.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.522
Couple of guys in the garb,
little hula-hula, blow the horn.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.569
We all work together.

23:37.760 --> 23:41.207
No, brah. Grab some food,
listen to the music and go home.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.207
How can we make this work, Bumpy?

23:49.640 --> 23:51.244
- He says two mountains.
- What?

23:51.440 --> 23:53.488
- Two mountains.
- Captain, please.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.445
- What?
- My kupuna says the two mountains...

23:56.640 --> 23:59.723
the two at the foot of the valley.
In good faith.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.331
I can't...
I can't give you back Hawaii, Bumpy.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.842
And free cell-phone service.
We don't get but one bar.

24:08.040 --> 24:11.089
- In fact, we hardly get that.
- I can't do that.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.762
- You're making it impossible for me.
- Take it or leave it.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.449
- King.
- Captain.

24:17.960 --> 24:22.761
I believe in our land and our myths
and our traditions...

24:22.960 --> 24:25.008
and more than anything, in the sky.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.329
- What are you doing?
- This is not the military of old, Bumpy.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.726
This is the new.

24:29.920 --> 24:33.720
And you have my word,
as a member of the 15th Airlift...

24:33.920 --> 24:36.491
of the United States
Air Force Space Command...

24:36.680 --> 24:40.366
that we will not put weapons
above these sacred islands.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.005
You can trust me.

24:44.120 --> 24:45.201
Bumpy, I'm sorry.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.209
Will you do one thing for me?

24:47.400 --> 24:49.801
- Of course.
- Can I hear "Waimanalo Blues"...

24:50.000 --> 24:51.650
- ...in the style of Gabby?
- Sure.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.611
I used to have a cassette version
and I lost it...

24:54.840 --> 24:57.366
and I crave it,
and I know they can play it.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.364
I guarantee it. Let's do that.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.005
Okay.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.483
Yeah.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.925
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

25:57.520 --> 26:00.000
- Sorry.
- Okay.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.043
- Free cell service and...
- Half a mountain.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.561
- Two mountains.
- No cell phone, one mountain.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.969
- Three mountains, no cell phone.
- Two mountains, cell phone.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.528
- We're there. You're tough.
- Tough? I gave you everything.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.206
- Hey, I didn't wanna give it.
- Thanks for bringing the car up.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.768
- Yeah, brah, no problem.
- This is our sovereign flag.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.964
My gift to you because we always ohana.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.448
I felt a lot of mana
from the two of you tonight.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.290
Especially you.

26:32.520 --> 26:36.047
Thank you, king. I'm deeply moved.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.764
Warmest aloha, Mr. Kanahele.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.411
Sky has a lot to say tonight.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.890
Stick around.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.805
You're gonna skin your knees
on eternity, brah.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.129
- Love of country.
- Love of country.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.243
- Love of country.
- Love of country.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.049
Never fuck you over, brah.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.600
I think the sky is speaking to us.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.211
Something's coming.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.569
You know this is all metaphorical.
This is how Hawaii works.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.922
We speak money,
they speak myths and sky...

27:20.120 --> 27:22.521
but the sky doesn't actually speak...

27:22.720 --> 27:24.290
and give an opinion.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.282
That was all about land,
cash and cell phones.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.325
Nothing's sacred.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.329
It's all for sale.

27:34.280 --> 27:37.011
Tell me you don't believe in the sky.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.844
You think it's just air up there?

27:41.320 --> 27:43.482
It's the future.

27:43.720 --> 27:47.441
That is the pull of the unknowable.
That's the answer to every question.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.887
Let's just keep it to the gate
and the blessing.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.687
Cell phones, mountain,
blessing on Sunday.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.041
Aloha.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.210
February 11, 1983,
I asked for a telescope.

28:13.600 --> 28:17.491
My dad drove to the Meade
telescope company in Long Beach...

28:17.680 --> 28:19.489
and got me this maroon scope.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.603
That was the summer
of the iridium flares.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.281
The iridium flares?

28:25.360 --> 28:27.840
It's the glint of the first satellites.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.724
A lot of them are dead now...

28:29.920 --> 28:33.845
but still streaking across the sky,
picking up the light of the sun.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.202
Where has that guy been?

28:47.520 --> 28:50.763
Stop the car. Stop. Stop the car.
Stop, stop, stop.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.689
- Look down. Look down.
- You okay?

28:55.680 --> 28:59.241
- What is it? What is it?
- It's the night marchers of Waimanalo.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.126
Ancient tribal warriors that are
paying respect to their ancestors.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.208
They're looking for their burial sites.
Show respect by looking down.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.846
You can't look up or you're cursed
because you're not Hawaiian.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.690
I'm aware of the myth.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.771
It's probably just a reenactment.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.083
Just making sure we're still alive.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.607
Are we?

29:36.720 --> 29:38.961
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

29:41.720 --> 29:42.846
I miss Dad.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.407
I always miss Dad.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.329
But he's gonna be home tomorrow.

29:47.520 --> 29:51.605
And Brian Gilcrest is coming over.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.849
Let's get you something to eat.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.003
Thanks, Hannah. Have a good night.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.685
Thanks, Mom.

30:29.720 --> 30:33.167
My dad was half Chinese, half Hawaiian.
And my mother is Swedish.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.330
She's of Swedish descent,
so I am a quarter Hawaiian.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.251
How great that they met.

30:40.480 --> 30:44.087
They had so much fun together.
They really did. What else can I do?

30:44.320 --> 30:47.688
Put the wings on this platter
and take it out, along with the salt.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.769
- That would be fantastic.
- Perfect.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.689
- That looks good.
- Thank you.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.764
You wore the uniform.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.161
Came from work.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.840
Filling out a report on me?

31:05.040 --> 31:08.601
- We shared an apparition last night.
- Reenactment.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.448
I salute your elaborate system
of denial, sir.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.647
- Hey, Spielberg.
- Don't look into the camera.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.446
- Okay. Is your mother in there?
- Yep.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.291
Yep.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.765
Hi.

31:32.680 --> 31:33.841
Would you like a beer?

31:34.720 --> 31:35.926
- No?
- I'm okay.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.561
- I'll ease into it. Do you have a soda?
- Yeah.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.570
- I'll take that.
- Here you go.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.001
That's lovely.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.282
Thank you. Very thoughtful.

31:49.600 --> 31:53.446
- I apologize in advance for Captain Ng.
- Oh, my God, are you kidding?

31:53.680 --> 31:56.968
She showed up early and helped me
with housework. I wanna keep her.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.322
She tell you
she was one-quarter Hawaiian?

31:59.560 --> 32:01.608
Yeah, like 50 times.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.202
Why don't you just have what you want?

32:09.440 --> 32:12.125
What? Well, do you have what you want?

32:20.720 --> 32:23.405
Your dad is Johnny Woodside.

32:25.240 --> 32:27.607
I'm gonna teach
you Woodside children to salute.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.330
It's something that you know.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.124
Cut at the corner of your eyebrow...

32:31.320 --> 32:34.210
and then drop it back down
the center line.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.167
Straight up. And back down.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.725
Mitchell, put your camera down.
I gotta see your salute.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.600
You've got it now on film forever.
Here we go.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.248
- He's got everything on film.
- Ready?

32:49.480 --> 32:53.451
Just go up the middle line of your body
and drop it back down.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.850
But up strong.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.166
And drop.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.364
You gotta be strong with it.
That was a little bit wobbly.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.842
You're gonna slice the air.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.128
Up to the eyebrow. Good.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.288
And, with some power, drop back down.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.323
I'm getting the hang of this.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.488
And here we go.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.810
Slice up. Straight up.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.002
And drop.

33:24.560 --> 33:25.641
That's good.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.886
- I am gonna have that beer.
- Okay.

33:29.680 --> 33:33.127
In answer to your question,
Woody doesn't speak.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.842
But you know what? He's a great dad.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.882
I don't think I'm ready
to talk to you like a girlfriend...

33:41.120 --> 33:44.169
so just stop me
before I talk to you like a girlfriend.

33:44.360 --> 33:47.489
He is a great dad.
He's a really great dad when he's here.

33:47.680 --> 33:51.162
And he got us this corner house,
and I really don't wanna lose it.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.320
So things are good.

33:55.240 --> 33:59.325
I'm not sure if it's supposed to make it
easier with him, you know, flying...

33:59.520 --> 34:04.048
to all these confidential locations
and not being able to tell me or...

34:04.240 --> 34:07.164
I'm just... I'm stressed. I'm stressed.

34:07.360 --> 34:11.081
I'm stressed all the time.
And if I'm stressed in Hawaii...

34:11.280 --> 34:14.601
I mean, can you imagine
what I would be like somewhere else?

34:15.040 --> 34:18.681
You even recognize the girl who ran
through Sheppard's Field naked...

34:18.880 --> 34:21.884
- ...after a Cure concert?
- Who could forget that girl?

34:23.639 --> 34:24.766
- You know what?
- What?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.400
Don't ever have any regrets.

34:29.520 --> 34:32.683
- I'm totally girlfriend-ing you right now.
- I like it.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.127
I don't even remember why we broke up.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.366
Because you didn't show up
on our vacation.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.527
I didn't mean to actually
talk about that.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.842
I had three days planned
in San Francisco.

34:43.040 --> 34:47.489
I had things for us to do and things
to tell you, and you stayed in Guam.

34:47.679 --> 34:48.806
Guam? Really?

34:49.600 --> 34:51.762
Don't pretend like you don't remember.

34:51.960 --> 34:54.201
I've waited for this.

34:54.440 --> 34:58.081
- If you calm down, I'll try and remember.
- I'm calm. This feels good.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.971
Hey, you know what, I do remember.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.131
You said, "if you don't show up,
then that's it."

35:05.320 --> 35:08.642
Because you're a workaholic
who creates work to avoid real work.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.330
I'm still working on that.

35:10.520 --> 35:14.969
But to me, you see,
a vacation can't be an ultimatum.

35:15.160 --> 35:18.846
How can you relax on an ultimatum?
The whole concept is stressful.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.407
You just had to show up.
I was looking for a gesture.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.086
It didn't have to be bold,
just something.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.441
I just wanted you to show up.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.805
Hey.

35:35.520 --> 35:38.000
I really loved you.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.085
And you wrecked everything.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.848
All our plans.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.201
Loose plans.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.646
And I put it back together by myself.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.801
I found a life in spite of you,
and you need to hear this...

36:09.000 --> 36:12.925
because I've waited a long time
to tell you this. You need to hear this.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.406
Maybe not all of it.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.251
You can't just let people go.

37:08.880 --> 37:12.248
- Okay, do you see what I mean?
- No, he said a lot, actually.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.487
What did he say?

37:14.680 --> 37:17.684
Well, for starters, he said:

37:19.640 --> 37:21.768
"Good evening. Welcome to my home."

37:21.960 --> 37:25.726
Then he walked over to me and put
his hand on my shoulder and he said:

37:25.920 --> 37:29.720
"I know you used to see my wife."
And then somewhere in there he said:

37:29.920 --> 37:32.890
"Check out my manliness.
I've been working out." Right?

37:33.080 --> 37:36.163
- And then... Right?
- I don't know. I don't know what he said.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.089
No, that was the order. Yes.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.363
He closed with, "I moved in
the second she was available...

37:41.560 --> 37:44.404
and I'm too handsome and happy
to ever see you as a threat.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.171
Good evening."
Then he left with his beer.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.170
- He said all that?
- And more. He's very talkative.

37:50.360 --> 37:53.284
- Mom?
- Oh, honey.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.884
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.690
How's this for winter formal?

37:59.280 --> 38:02.124
I don't want her
to get one minute older.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.810
- I like the sleeves.
- I like the sleeves.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.770
Wow, she looks just like you.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.849
Thank God.

38:17.880 --> 38:18.927
Mr. Gilcrest?

38:23.440 --> 38:24.965
Cool room.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.730
Thanks.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.730
- The Corona Borealis constellation.
- Yeah.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.447
- Nice collection.
- Thanks.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.404
My man.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.368
That's very interesting.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.846
That's a lovely couple.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.929
Did you almost marry my mom?

38:52.600 --> 38:53.647
Many, many times.

38:55.280 --> 38:58.124
Why would anybody break up with my mom?

39:04.160 --> 39:06.891
- What's that?
- That's The Arrival.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.209
The Arrival.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.165
The fourth and fifth signs
are lining up.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.886
Sacrifice and the healing of his wounds.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.441
Are you Lono?

39:19.640 --> 39:22.530
How does the myth end,
so I know how to plan my summer?

39:22.720 --> 39:26.122
The Arrival myth ends
when Pele claims Lono...

39:26.320 --> 39:31.201
and takes him to her volcano
for a thousand years of...

39:31.760 --> 39:33.125
revenge sex.

39:33.320 --> 39:35.288
To be eased only through eruption...

39:36.000 --> 39:39.368
and the creation
of the next Hawaiian island, Loihi.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.606
Then you become raindrops.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.448
That's not a bad deal.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.046
- Mr. Gilcrest?
- Brian.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.010
Brian.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.888
You are Lono.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.809
- Just flip it around.
- You wanna see it? Here.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.650
I'm so touched by the hula.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.644
Aren't you?

40:35.120 --> 40:37.202
It's just such an expressive gift.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.927
My teacher tells me
that my arms are the problem.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.288
No, not a problem.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.365
Don't think about your arms.

40:45.680 --> 40:50.686
Just address the land and the sky...

40:50.920 --> 40:52.649
Woody, you ready?

40:52.880 --> 40:54.245
- Fixed?
- ...and the water.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.851
Fixed.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.364
She's got a wicked hula.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.969
Majorly, captain.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.686
Beautiful.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.360
Okay, everybody, let's do it.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.123
I'm Lono.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.209
I love him.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.283
Dude, I love my lawn.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.450
I know.

41:48.880 --> 41:50.803
Love my lawn.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.004
All right, you two.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.445
- There you go.
- Thank you.

42:12.640 --> 42:15.769
General Dixon. Shit is going on.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.847
- Nice to see you.
- Happy holidays, general.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.166
Good to see you, sir.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.323
- Happy holidays, sir. How are you?
- Hello, general.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.762
Get it, get it, get it. Yeah.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.568
You guys want something to drink?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.968
Yeah. I'll take a Kamehameha lemonade.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.764
Same for you?

42:53.440 --> 42:55.169
- Got it.
- I'll help.

43:01.680 --> 43:05.241
Can I get two Kamehameha lemonades
and a Jack and Coke, please?

43:18.560 --> 43:20.642
Can I have a beer, please?

43:23.160 --> 43:24.605
Careful.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.610
- Did you feel that?
- What's that?

43:27.800 --> 43:29.723
They say the menehune come in
with wind...

43:29.960 --> 43:32.122
and they haunt
the Officers' Club at night.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.607
And they mess with the photos
of the old airmen.

43:34.840 --> 43:38.367
Captain, come on.
Not every noe lani is a puka lani.

43:38.560 --> 43:42.201
- Not every gentle mist is a gate to heaven.
- Nice.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.004
What is the future?

43:47.920 --> 43:50.730
The future isn't just something
that happens.

43:51.480 --> 43:56.122
It's a brutal force
with a great sense of humor...

43:56.360 --> 43:59.091
that'll steamroll you
if you're not watching.

43:59.320 --> 44:02.085
But we're all gonna take a girls' trip
in her minivan.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.810
- Great.
- Love it.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.129
- We're leaving the kids and just going.
- Okay.

44:16.120 --> 44:19.966
How is it that a high-ranking professional
is alone on the holidays?

44:20.720 --> 44:23.246
Well, I don't hook up, I get deployed.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.965
- Tell me about it.
- You know the truth.

44:25.160 --> 44:29.563
I mean, two years is too long to keep
anything going, and I'd rather be alone.

44:29.760 --> 44:33.003
It's been guys who are like me.
I call them "Alone Togethers."

44:33.200 --> 44:36.647
- Maybe you should go civilian next time.
- Are you kidding me?

44:36.840 --> 44:39.571
Can you think of a way
to make "I'm a fighter pilot" sexy?

44:39.760 --> 44:42.366
Well, you just have to work
on your delivery, Ng.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.688
I'm a fighter pilot.

44:44.880 --> 44:47.008
Try going a little lower.

44:47.720 --> 44:49.882
I'm a fighter pilot.

44:50.120 --> 44:53.408
See, that's just strong stuff.
I think that just works.

44:56.040 --> 45:00.125
Kamehameha. All right. I'm gonna...
I'll see you at the table.

45:00.320 --> 45:04.166
- Out here. Out here.
- Thank you for the camaraderie.

45:04.360 --> 45:08.331
- "Everybody Wants to Rule the World."
- Coming right up, sir.

45:13.960 --> 45:15.689
Don't stand up, Gilcrest.

45:16.560 --> 45:20.007
- On second thought, do stand up.
- It's good to see you, general.

45:20.200 --> 45:23.966
Is it true you cut a deal with Bumpy
for the blessing?

45:24.200 --> 45:26.521
Carson Welch is very impressed with you.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.166
He's important to us,
so don't screw this up.

45:29.360 --> 45:34.207
- Yes. Two mountains, cell phone service.
- Half a mountain, no cell phone service.

45:34.400 --> 45:35.765
General Dixon, sir.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.130
Gilcrest, don't give me
any more reason to dislike you.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.288
I didn't know you disliked me.

45:44.840 --> 45:47.081
Happy holidays, bottom feeder.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.962
Happy holidays, general.

46:00.520 --> 46:03.285
- What did you say to Dixon?
- I let him insult me.

46:03.480 --> 46:07.883
He loves you. You are bringing
a very studly game to Brave Angel.

46:09.960 --> 46:12.884
I want you to have this.
From Carson Welch's people.

46:13.120 --> 46:14.770
It's a gift to give Brave Angel.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.446
- Oh, what is it?
- New codes. That's all I know.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.007
Welcome to your expanded
job description.

46:21.360 --> 46:23.681
Carson wants to speak to you.
Wait in the hallway.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.410
What, now?

46:26.320 --> 46:27.765
Now.

46:46.560 --> 46:48.244
Nice work, Gilcrest.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.369
You're back in the bird's nest.

46:52.600 --> 46:55.763
- What are we putting up there, Carson?
- We're doing things...

46:56.000 --> 46:59.925
this country was built to do
before 20 layers of government...

47:00.120 --> 47:01.565
- ...slowed us down...
- Okay.

47:01.760 --> 47:05.162
...and let China kick our keisters
all over the Pacific.

47:05.360 --> 47:08.330
We are taking command personally.

47:09.080 --> 47:13.244
Yes, I was angry with you about Kabul.

47:13.440 --> 47:16.011
I knew what was going on,
about the skimming.

47:16.200 --> 47:18.601
I never thought twice about it.

47:18.800 --> 47:22.407
But that money you pocketed
from the Afghanis, that was different.

47:24.520 --> 47:28.491
You destroyed yourself for 100 lousy K.

47:28.880 --> 47:32.168
You thought I never knew. I always knew.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.644
- Carson...
- So, you're back in the game.

47:35.840 --> 47:39.845
Now, if you can stay on track,
you'll find a way to get this done...

47:40.080 --> 47:43.482
down and dirty, smooth like Indian silk.

47:44.120 --> 47:46.282
And this crazy little Mayberry base...

47:46.480 --> 47:49.848
will be the center
of a whole new operation.

47:51.760 --> 47:55.242
TNO, Gilcrest. Tell no one.

47:59.720 --> 48:00.926
You're back.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.122
Captain Ng, this is Carson Welch.

48:03.320 --> 48:04.810
Captain Ng.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.528
Your reputation as a dancer
precedes you.

48:17.920 --> 48:22.005
One, two, three, two.
One, two, three, two.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.282
One, two, three, two.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.482
One, two, three, two.

48:41.600 --> 48:44.809
Happy New Year, Carson. There you go.

48:46.520 --> 48:49.364
Cheers. Cheers.

48:52.560 --> 48:54.164
Excuse me. Excuse me.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.968
God bless America!

50:35.960 --> 50:37.769
Bless you.

50:38.520 --> 50:39.567
Thank you.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.529
What you doing?

50:42.200 --> 50:48.082
E-mails, trying to bail
my brother out online, parking tickets.

50:49.720 --> 50:50.767
Are you dressed?

50:50.960 --> 50:52.644
No, I'm not.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.491
Yes, you are.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.325
Hey, about tonight, sir...

50:59.520 --> 51:00.646
Yes, captain?

51:01.640 --> 51:04.325
- ...I had fun.
- Fun is good.

51:04.840 --> 51:05.921
And some shots.

51:06.160 --> 51:08.162
Are you kidding?

51:09.360 --> 51:12.569
I danced with the devil, and I liked it.

51:12.760 --> 51:16.162
Well, captain,
I will tell you this for sure...

51:16.360 --> 51:20.524
in any of its many forms,
I have found that nothing beats fun.

51:21.680 --> 51:22.761
Maybe purpose.

51:25.720 --> 51:27.404
Do you wanna come over?

51:36.560 --> 51:38.449
That's peppermint tea.

51:42.280 --> 51:43.964
Thank you.

51:44.520 --> 51:48.764
Hey. Have you seen the latest spec
of all the birds we have up in the sky?

51:49.520 --> 51:51.807
- No.
- Can you imagine all of this...

51:52.040 --> 51:53.724
with weapons?

51:54.200 --> 51:55.326
What?

51:55.520 --> 51:57.409
Oh, that's my dog. Hold on.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.443
That's my mom and dad.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.244
This, with weapons.

52:01.440 --> 52:03.363
All those dots are satellites.

52:03.560 --> 52:05.722
It's like a celestial traffic jam.

52:05.920 --> 52:10.084
I mean, if we can't look up and see purity
or promise, we are finished.

52:10.280 --> 52:12.328
That's why we have a space treaty.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.687
What are all those stickers
on your unit?

52:27.200 --> 52:29.726
Well, there's one
for each adventure, captain.

52:29.920 --> 52:32.605
Do any of those adventures wear dresses?

52:32.800 --> 52:36.043
Some. Some are for missions
and some are for cities.

52:37.400 --> 52:39.562
What's the yellow one?

52:41.440 --> 52:43.010
That's...

52:44.720 --> 52:46.643
the Helena Project.

52:48.800 --> 52:53.010
I love the Helena Project. I mean,
I knew that you studied black holes...

52:53.200 --> 52:57.524
and Geodymetric physics, but I didn't
know you pioneered sound transducing.

52:57.720 --> 53:01.247
I was sound transducing when
you were still in a ballerina costume.

53:01.440 --> 53:02.930
The use of sound in space.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.804
Why is that so exciting to me?

53:05.000 --> 53:06.729
Yeah, good times.

53:10.440 --> 53:11.771
I've never been shot.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.570
You've never been shot?

53:13.760 --> 53:16.081
- That's a good thing.
- Prepare me.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.850
What's it like?

53:18.960 --> 53:23.204
Well, captain, I feel that question
in about 18 different parts of my body.

53:25.400 --> 53:27.050
Me too.

53:29.600 --> 53:32.922
They say that you can tell
most of the time by the sound.

53:33.120 --> 53:36.727
A well-aimed shot from a weapon
sounds like nothing else. It's like...

53:36.920 --> 53:39.810
Home-run ball coming off the bat.

53:46.920 --> 53:49.127
Boy, did I mess up in Kabul.

53:52.080 --> 53:54.447
I was surrounded
by all this brutal ugliness.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.164
Philanderers.

53:57.760 --> 53:59.649
Nothing black and white.

53:59.880 --> 54:02.406
Soul-crushing mercenaries.

54:02.600 --> 54:04.728
And I was one of them.

54:05.960 --> 54:09.965
I saw that missile coming for me,
and I didn't get out of the way.

54:12.760 --> 54:13.807
I didn't care.

54:19.080 --> 54:21.128
You lost your iridium flares.

54:25.080 --> 54:26.411
Tonight...

54:27.840 --> 54:31.526
it's kind of the first night
I'm truly happy I lived.

54:39.080 --> 54:41.003
Gilcrest.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.284
- Really?
- I'm a major select, sir.

54:52.760 --> 54:55.764
I'm at a crossroads
where I can't mess up.

54:57.280 --> 55:01.490
And I don't wanna wind up
a decal on your laptop.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.442
Because I couldn't breathe.

55:04.640 --> 55:08.611
All flattened out there
with everybody else, so it's...

55:26.000 --> 55:28.082
Wanna see something
you've never seen before?

55:28.280 --> 55:30.408
I think I left my sunglasses
at the Kingdom.

55:30.600 --> 55:32.568
Oh, that's a tough asset to lose.

55:32.800 --> 55:35.087
Can't stop looking at it, can you?

55:37.440 --> 55:39.522
It's mesmerizing.

55:40.720 --> 55:43.007
- Just try and look away.
- I can't.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.929
It's impossible.

55:46.040 --> 55:49.840
It was the Sudan. It was me and two guys.
We stepped on a PBD mine.

55:50.040 --> 55:51.769
There was a horrible doctor...

55:51.960 --> 55:54.850
and he sewed one of the guy's toes
onto my foot.

55:55.080 --> 55:56.650
- What?
- Yes.

55:56.840 --> 55:59.969
That's another guy's toe? Oh, my God.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.810
Yeah, if you look closely...

56:02.040 --> 56:04.611
you'll see the entire
Middle Eastern conflict on my leg.

56:04.840 --> 56:07.081
Feels like we're in the room
with another person.

56:07.280 --> 56:08.850
We are.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.610
I believe everything you say.

56:10.840 --> 56:14.481
Well, you shouldn't.
I'm a contractor, nothing more.

56:15.320 --> 56:17.721
Here I am complaining
about my sunglasses.

56:17.920 --> 56:21.208
And here I am complaining about nothing.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.962
Come on, let's move!

57:24.160 --> 57:25.685
Morning.

57:42.800 --> 57:45.007
Hey, Hula. Happy Saturday.

57:45.440 --> 57:47.010
- Hey.
- Are your parents home?

57:47.200 --> 57:49.089
I just wanted to thank them
for the other night.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.441
They're not home.

57:50.640 --> 57:52.483
I am stuck babysitting the baby.

57:53.400 --> 57:55.323
- Shut up.
- Hey, baby.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.564
I'm kidding. Can I leave a note?

57:59.760 --> 58:01.364
- Of course. Come in.
- Okay.

58:02.360 --> 58:03.691
What are you watching?

58:03.880 --> 58:05.211
Some footage that I shot.

58:05.400 --> 58:07.562
You shot this?

58:18.640 --> 58:19.801
Holy mackerel.

58:20.400 --> 58:22.323
What do you think it is?

58:23.760 --> 58:26.650
Look at the size of that thing.

58:27.920 --> 58:29.968
It seems very sophisticated.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.447
This is a big covert operation.

58:32.640 --> 58:34.768
I bet the whole Pacific is in play.

58:34.960 --> 58:36.291
When did you shoot this?

58:37.520 --> 58:38.851
Middle of the night.

58:39.040 --> 58:41.122
Two nights ago.

58:48.320 --> 58:50.687
Butt-kick, stick it to the back. Nice.

58:50.920 --> 58:54.163
I called you because I think
I have to tender my resignation.

58:54.360 --> 58:58.365
- Is "tender" the right word for that?
- Come on. It's Saturday. Don't do this.

58:58.560 --> 59:00.722
I'm sorry to disturb your Saturday.

59:00.920 --> 59:04.003
I got Troy and Melissa here.
I got a girlfriend's kid, Don.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.850
Have you met a baby named Don?

59:06.040 --> 59:08.122
No, sir. Hi, Don.

59:08.320 --> 59:11.085
Come on. This feels more
like a Monday kind of thing.

59:11.280 --> 59:14.921
- Tell me everything you know.
- I don't know what's going on up there.

59:15.120 --> 59:19.011
It's not an Air Force launch. They let me
know what they want me to know.

59:19.240 --> 59:22.164
Private money's running the whole thing.
We work for them.

59:22.360 --> 59:24.442
This is the new military, captain.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.404
Kesha could launch a satellite.

59:26.600 --> 59:29.843
She doesn't have to tell us
what's on it either. No treaty for that.

59:30.080 --> 59:33.721
This one looks like a dual-purpose
launch vehicle that will amp up...

59:33.960 --> 59:36.804
a worldwide rush
to fill the skies with weapons.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.401
I didn't get the memo on that.
We don't know what's on this launch.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.682
If that's true, we're in worse trouble
than I thought.

59:41.880 --> 59:45.487
Don't resign, all right? You'd have
better luck talking to privateers.

59:45.720 --> 59:47.688
Contractors are running everything.

59:47.880 --> 59:50.451
Global One is running the lead
on this operation.

59:50.640 --> 59:53.564
- It's Carson Welch's rocket.
- Gilcrest?

59:57.400 --> 59:59.402
How much does Gilcrest know, sir?

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.683
Now that he's back with Welch,
how much does he not know?

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.728
You know what? I'll take that hat too.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.566
Oh, boy, am I a goner.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.046
Hello, sir.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.288
Hello, captain.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.970
It is a victory and an honor
to steal you away this afternoon.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.961
Got you a peppermint tea.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.921
Oh, the hat.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.051
You must be wondering about this hat.
This hat serves no purpose.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.403
The entire idea of including sunglasses
in the actual hat...

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.807
is ridiculous and unwieldy in execution.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.201
Yet somehow...

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.327
you lost your sunglasses
and somebody stole your badass look.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.049
Anyway...

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.041
you may now wear the hat.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.604
I understand your reluctance.
I know what it represents.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.882
My first civilian gift to you.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.321
And what do I really have to offer you?

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.885
Everybody I've gotten close to, I've
managed to detach myself in some way.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.841
And frankly, just floating
the idea of you and me as a couple...

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.607
all I see are problems.
I am talking about world chaos.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.888
I'm talking about panic in the streets.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.641
Demonstrations, riots, problems
with your promotion, strange incidents.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.766
And let's just be honest,
it'll end as it began.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.601
A flicker of an impossible dream
and an avalanche of emotional chaos.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.723
And I'm sorry, but...

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.402
I'm in for all of it.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.565
Is that a yes?

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.802
- I think I have an allergy.
- It's going around. You loving the hat?

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.641
I feel silly.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.570
Well, you wear silly well.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.201
I know what you know.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.725
What?

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.809
Stop with the games.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.407
Oh, my God. I got personal with you.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.491
I never get personal.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.887
- I had fun with you.
- Good.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.282
- I believed you.
- Good.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.285
That's...

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.922
- You told me not to.
- No, no, no.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.646
That might be the worst part.
I believed you, and you told me not to.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.963
- No. You got this all wrong.
- I didn't come here to argue.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.721
You came to knife me in a gut-and-run.
I know the type. I am the type.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.804
What am I saying?

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.524
I need you to believe in me.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.251
I know what you know.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.047
And what do I know?

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.601
You lied to everybody.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.404
You knew about the launch.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.001
You knew about that ASAT rocket.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.249
You were distracting those Hawaiians
and giving them what?

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.727
Property they already owned
a thousand years ago?

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.363
- I don't have mountains to give them.
- You let me lie to the Hawaiians.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.404
I'm Hawaiian. You lost your signal.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.085
You are lost.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.764
Hey!

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.529
Hey! Hey, I just wanted to say,
good luck with your career!

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.486
I'm sure you're gonna get NRO.
Find somebody else to recommend you.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.330
- You think that's what this is about?
- You tell me.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.921
I'm here
because you needed a babysitter.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.162
I volunteered to be your watchdog.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.081
I defended you when everybody said,
"You better watch out for that guy.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.602
He's morally bankrupt and the guy
you get to do your dirty work."

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.167
Who's everybody?
Everybody in the streets?

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.251
In the world? Were they all gathered
at a mountaintop and sing to you?

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.250
Your cynicism is astounding,
Mr. Gilcrest.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.769
Thank you for the hat, by the way.
It's a nice souvenir.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.201
- Are there weapons in it?
- Just leave it.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.166
- I was your last chance.
- Right, yeah, and you know so much.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.683
And you knew everything.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.288
You sold your soul so many times,
nobody's buying anymore.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.843
Oh, hey, Dad.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.404
Hey, Woody.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.484
Can I get your autograph?

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.160
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:30.128
- Thank-you notes, huh?
- Yep.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.290
- How was winter prom?
- Nice.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.562
- Yeah?
- It was good. Yeah.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.967
Except it's winter social.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.089
Sorry, bunny.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.930
How was work?

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.001
Yeah, good.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.690
Okay.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.810
And that's it?
That's all we have to say about it?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.964
Yeah. Good.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.449
Just gonna...

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.364
This is all Gilcrest's fault.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.245
This is not Gilcrest's fault.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.920
We had problems
long before Gilcrest showed up.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.329
- Maybe it's not his fault, but I...
- But what?

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.930
What?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.881
Just talk to me.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.686
You don't talk to me.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.322
Say something.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.362
Woody,
I can't take this silence anymore.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.803
You stay.

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.726
- I'm leaving.
- No.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.851
No.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.923
I'll go.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.441
I'm always going.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.961
All right, so...

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.730
I'll go.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.529
Hello?

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.403
Are you leaving?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.321
I got one more appointment with Bumpy,
then the gate blessing.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.689
Grace, could you just go down
and check on your brother?

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.405
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.445
Okay, not so fast.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.965
We have stuff to deal with before
the famous Gilcrest exodus. Look...

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.127
She's a great girl.
Woody is a lucky father.

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:24.809
Hey, I think that you came back here
for a reason whether you knew it or not...

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.731
- ...and I think you did.
- The Arrival is departing.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.127
Hey, it's time, okay?

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.600
- You're going to tell me what I may know.
- What...? What is that?

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:40.805
Say it.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.770
Just say it.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.243
Let's just straight-up talk about it
before I explode.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:50.125
- Let me ask you like this.
- Okay.

01:08:50.319 --> 01:08:52.162
Let's say it's Father's Day.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:56.801
Do I have something to celebrate or not?

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.170
You celebrate.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.564
Okay.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.841
Finally.

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:24.169
Come back! Come back! Come back!

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.451
Oh, my God.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.961
There's a lot of you there.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.604
Excuse you. Stop it!

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.689
Who else knows?

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.321
Well, let's see.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.447
It's been me for 13 years.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.720
Woody?

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.729
No, we never discussed it.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.522
- But then... Yeah.
- The silent thing.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.484
You could've had the discussion
without knowing.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.489
Exactly.

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.128
He left last night.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.243
He left?

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.081
- Was he angry?
- He decapitated Santa Claus.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.726
Don't call me "bunny."
I don't like it. Stop.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.250
Stop it.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.284
I should go.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.725
- Grace? Honey?
- Mitchell.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.889
We're gonna go.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.971
Stop teasing your sister.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.810
Yes. Let's go.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.360
I am standing
at the groundbreaking ceremony...

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.250
for the Hickam Air Force Base
pedestrian gate...

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.001
where ancient Hawaiian bones
will be blessed by local leaders.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.522
Relocating the gate will enable
the Air Force's new partner...

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.929
Global One's Carson Welch,
to build new factories...

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.044
and fully privatize space exploration
from Hawaii.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.084
And look at the excitement in the air.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.610
- Shenanigans.
- Both of you, come on. Let's go.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.600
Excuse me, lips moving.
Talking to you both.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.081
We've been compromised.
We're moving up the launch.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.886
- They need you. Carson asked for you.
- I'll do it.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.971
Excuse me, is this happening now?
I am not a part of this. I will not be.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.128
We are 20 minutes away from an incident.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.321
I'll do it.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.608
- What does she know?
- Too much.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.644
- Can we drop her off?
- Hey! You guys are stuck together...

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.763
until DoD unsticks you.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.645
DoD says the Chinese might have
hacked into the payload.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.367
- They're not gonna cancel the launch?
- Thank you. Finally, a good idea.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.928
It's already in motion. Carson has
the window. Time is a big factor.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.367
- You're the guy to do this.
- He's past his prime.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.722
- You peaked in dancing school.
- Enough!

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.410
- I'll do it.
- Good.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.046
There's a black outpost
six minutes away.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.971
Take it easy, brah. Relax.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.801
It's a beautiful day for flight here
at our equatorial launch site...

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.483
134 miles south of Hawaii
in international waters.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.203
The launch vehicle is ready for its most
direct route to geosynchronous orbit.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.880
All systems are looking good
at this time.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.323
The weather for today's mission is good.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.690
Move quickly.
We have a room in the back.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.326
Fingers.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.921
They just pulled me onto this.
I thought we had till Monday.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.322
You wanted back in the game.
This is the game.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.807
- Who's in charge?
- Parts of all of us. Here.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.283
- You work for Welch, don't you know?
- Everybody thinks I know everything.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.643
- Welcome to my world.
- Everybody, turn off your jingle bells.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.123
Let's bleach this hack. Who we got
at Kaena Point Tracking Station?

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.321
- We got Roy up there at HULA?
- Yeah. Hey.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.321
- Roy.
- Hey, Gilcrest.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.210
Alive again, back from the dead.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.643
Enough of this make-out session.
Focus on the launch.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.524
- Carson. Carson for you.
- Yeah.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.564
- Welcome back to the driver's seat.
- At your service.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.889
We have a small window to gain control
of our cyber intruder.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.165
Yes, we do. So why don't you just
sit back and watch it happen, sir.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:02.845
- Never loved you more than I do now.
- You're gonna love me a lot very soon.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.208
Go ahead and launch,
and I'll grab the hack.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.448
Roy, can you get all the codes
on a monitor?

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.722
- Yeah.
- Thank you for saving the world.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.406
- You're so welcome.
- Prepare for liftoff.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.809
Five, four...

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.082
three, two...

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.290
one.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.687
- Brian?
- Liftoff.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.170
Main engine continues
with nominal thrust.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.642
Begin control status.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.403
Final destabilization
established as nominal.

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.210
Go, go, go.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.563
Propulsion system
performance status, nominal.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.601
Okay, all systems look good.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.690
Second stage. Main engine ignition.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.005
Carson.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.809
- Gilcrest.
- Have you done the job?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.004
- Did you bleach the hack? Is it gone?
- Reversing the panic code.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.971
Pinging it through the first transponder,
then out back through the system.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.089
Speak to me in subservient English.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.567
- Quiet.
- The Chinese hack, sir...

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.564
is gone.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.564
- Outstanding, Gilcrest.
- Good save.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.091
Flight is now transonic.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.169
We are in orbit.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.048
Way to do it.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.804
- Excellent.
- Yeah!

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.042
Second stage renewed.
Main engine ignition.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.568
In position and normal.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.806
- Roy?
- Yeah?

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.850
Bring up the deck
from the Helena Project in '05, okay?

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.687
Do a little old-school
sound transducing.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.402
- Sound transducing? Why...?
- Ask questions later. Just do it.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.806
Come on, Roy.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.889
- You got it?
- Got it.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.004
Okay, good. Send a message up there
to Brave Angel fast.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.362
Brave Angel? What are you doing?

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.649
Prepare the deck for upload.
No time for questions. Do it.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.481
It's dangerous to spoof it with sound.
You could destroy the whole thing.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.284
- Yeah, exactly.
- We got it.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.960
Okay, I got it.
Prepare for upload of the asset.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.890
- What are you pinging it with?
- Every bit of recorded information...

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.924
- ...in the history of sound.
- Jesus. That's a big ping.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.361
- The biggest.
- I see what you're doing...

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.642
- ...and I'd advise against it.
- Release.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.888
Oh, God. You absolutely sure about this?

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.367
- Roy, release.
- It is not easy being your friend.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.284
Release.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.286
Release.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.369
Do it.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.961
Hello?

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:10.803
One of the most unique...

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.367
- Yeah.
- I like that.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.883
We will see you...

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.607
Yesterday, December 7th, 19...

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.484
Welcome, travelers.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.966
No, no, no.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.724
On video with the sounds of man in...

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:30.049
That's how we do things downtown.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.167
What is this?

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.001
- Enjoy this speedy, easy way.
- Darn, darn, darn. Now, who...?

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.404
No hot water, no toilets, no lights,
but Whitey's on the moon.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.204
No. Stop, stop, stop.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.529
- Let me in there.
- I've got no experience with this.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.046
This is crazy time.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.806
He hates these cans!

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.685
Stay away from the cans!

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.487
What's in the box?

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.442
Stella!

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.645
- You can't handle the truth!
- There's no crying in baseball!

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.003
My God.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.929
Goodbye, Roy.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:50.685
You're gonna have to stay away
from me now. I'm radioactive.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.604
Well, this is gonna be a topic
of conversation.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.810
I'm gonna get some air.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.486
Yeah. Don't go too far.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.920
I'm on it, sir. Yes.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.244
Hey. You did the right thing, Brian.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.842
Listen to me. From this moment on,
don't get near me.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.929
- You can't stop me.
- Don't be naive. Save yourself.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.250
In five seconds, someone's coming out
and everything between us is over.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.448
You are just starting, I am finished.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.690
It's over.

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.805
- You're late.
- Am I?

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.049
I get it.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.686
I left you for dead in Kabul...

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:09.011
and this is your pretty cheap revenge.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.370
Can't buy the sky, Carson.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.168
Let me get this straight.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.325
I'm the bad guy to you...

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.445
because I'm trying to protect
our country...

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.483
our American culture.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.651
You can't stop the future
with one silly, desperate act.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.125
I'll build another rocket.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.290
There was a second payload,
with weapons...

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.847
and you almost got it by everybody.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:43.203
You're about to become
the single biggest joke...

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.166
- ...in the history of aerodynamic flight.
- Can't hurt me, I've been dead before.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.488
Not like this, pally.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:54.881
Your life is gonna become very...

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.084
very complicated.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.643
Just remember,
the general always speaks first.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:12.129
Don't say a word. You let him say what
he has to say, you sit there, you take it.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.561
Hopefully, the holiday spirit will
have him in a good mood.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.609
Happy New Year's, general.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.287
- Happy New Year.
- And the general is here.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.209
Gilcrest is here, that's why.

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:49.367
- Well, I remember the good times.
- There were no good times!

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:56.049
How does it feel to set back our footprint
in the Pacific by a decade?

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.240
You cost us our prime new partner,
future missions...

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.727
a new space-command center, all gone...

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:06.208
because Carson Welch canceled
his contract with us. And why?

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.200
Why did it all go bad?
Because cool guy here, Mr. Sexy Pants...

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.887
Brian Gilcrest, lost Brave Angel!

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.366
You did that.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:19.128
And now you're gonna go to the Hill,
and you are gonna testify.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.284
And, oh, it will not go well.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.441
The best you can hope for is some
trailer-park honey falls in love with you...

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.564
on C-SPAN, and you get
a conjugal visit every other month...

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.604
always in the presence
of a chaperone named Tex.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.245
Good times.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.204
Just around the bend.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:41.486
General, there was a weaponized
second payload on Brave Angel.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:45.611
Weapons? You think you saw weapons?
Let me tell you what you saw.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.646
You saw a complex, philanthropic
telecommunications satellite...

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.889
co-venture between Global One
and Facebook!

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:57.131
Designed to help six poverty-stricken
countries in the Pacific Rim.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:03.481
Now teenagers in Equatorial New Guinea
can't meet and date because of you.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.728
Nobody tells me anything.
I didn't know that.

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.890
Shut up and keep flexing
your crazy fingers!

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.805
- I told you he would be a disaster!
- Yes, sir.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.964
And one more thing,
Mr. Three-Day Beard Boy.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.730
Stay away from Allison Ng!

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.840
We've got six and a half years
invested in her.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.249
She's part of Hillary Clinton's Star Guard.
Know what that is?

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.726
Well, neither do I!

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:28.003
When she gets off the plane in Oahu,
she likes to see Allison there.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.851
She likes her salute. And so do we.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.804
Stay away from our girl!

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:29.484
Current lat and lon is 34, 52...

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:33.765
85 east, 69, 17, 17 north.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.605
Poor Gilcrest.
You took the vanity road, didn't you?

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.810
You ruined yourself to impress a girl.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.570
And did you get the girl?

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.369
No, I didn't.

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.644
Close, though.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.850
Well, that's too bad.
She was a good one.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.806
I got you a new Santa Claus.
Very strong neck.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.047
They were giving them away.
Christmas is over.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.760
It's the holiday of chill.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:13.888
Brian, that is bizarrely sweet of you
and completely unnecessary.

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.166
- Guess what.
- What?

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.489
- Woody wrote me a letter.
- You're kidding.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.730
Nope. Words and everything.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.610
Really?

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.883
"Dear Tracy.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:33.771
You asked me to speak my mind,
so here it is. My mind.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.687
Do not penalize me for not being
one of those flowery people...

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.601
who shoot their feelings in a spray
like a fire hydrant on a summer day."

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.122
No worry about that.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.567
I've never seen him do that.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:50.526
"I just hated the way you changed
when Gilcrest came back to town.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.081
But I don't like to hate.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.606
It's bad for my brain.

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.164
Every night...

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.282
when I come home, I start fresh.

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.882
I don't bring
what happens up there down here.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.207
I may not be the original owner
of your heart...

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.762
but I am the better owner
and a much healthier option too!"

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.122
Exclamation point there.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.681
Mom, there's a new Santa outside.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:32.611
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.686
I liked him a little better
when he was silent.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.570
But keep going.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.163
"You have no...

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.761
You have no idea
the fear you calm in me...

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:57.328
every night I come back home
through that squeaky back door.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.207
Aloha, Woody."

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:12.321
Well, anywhere you turn,
somebody's heart breaks.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.285
Well, come on.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:21.726
You gotta take a big bite out of your life.
Your husband wrote that.

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.962
Are you trying to play matchmaker now?

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.642
I was on the fence till the door part,
but that was the final blow.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.884
- Oh, really?
- I didn't even hear that squeaky door.

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.650
I think I...

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.247
I just completely lack
that romantic gene.

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.762
Just noise to me.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.530
He's your guy.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.366
My opinion?

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:58.167
Go be with Captain Ng.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.291
That girl lit up your sky.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.446
No, I messed that up.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:08.202
Trust a girl who's been on the other side
of your mega mess-ups in the past.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.769
Take those blue eyes and go to her.

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.846
Yeah, you don't want it to be taut,
all right?

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:20.804
You want it to billow.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.289
And that's how you hang a flag.

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:24.851
I like it.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.884
Are you okay?

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.730
- Is that Dad?
- Dad's home?

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.809
- Yeah, Dad's home.
- Hey, Dad.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.209
- Where were you? We missed you.
- Dad.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.171
- Tell him what it is.
- Well, we decided...

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.322
Well, who wants to help me clean up
the Christmas decorations?

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.806
Not me.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.643
Welcome to your hearing, Gilcrest.

01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:59.369
Congratulations. You're a hero.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:03.167
Your buddy Carson Welch was setting
a nuclear outpost for himself...

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:04.407
up in the sky.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.803
- Get the Great One a drink.
- He hid it from everybody.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.002
He wanted to arm America
with his own nuke.

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.409
He would've owned the sky.
He would've been his own country.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:18.049
Everybody knew a little,
but nobody knew everything except...

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.611
Welch.

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:23.043
- It'll all be labeled as a malfunction.
- It was a bit messy.

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:26.727
But you made us look good.
I'll take all the credit, of course.

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:31.847
Interpol and our guys are taking over.
They're picking Carson up in Japan...

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.767
in just about 30 seconds.

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:16.764
This is what we get for letting civilians
into space. Drop your bat, go out on a hit.

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.082
All the great ones do.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:23.847
Captain Ng?

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.490
Let it go.

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:33.806
She's on her way.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.487
Get lost, Gilcrest.

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:57.490
I wanna know
what you were like growing up.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.331
What was your favorite pair of shoes?

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.649
What was your favorite cereal?
What was the first car you drove?

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:10.171
I mean, I'm just getting started here.
I wanna know everything about you.

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:14.766
Why are you still here?

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.488
Wherever you're flying, come back,
I'll be waiting for you.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.649
Ten words.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.567
That's a lot more than five, Gilcrest.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.883
I love you...

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.886
Allison.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.289
It's four. That's not bad.

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.646
I'm staying.

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.090
Now we're talking.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.128
Can I give you a lift, captain?

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.251
Oh, yeah.

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.651
Absolutely, Brian.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.405
There's one more thing I need to do.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.250
- Yes, you do.
- Yeah.

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:23.360
This is protection.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.520
Right on.
