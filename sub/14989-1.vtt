00:32.482 --> 00:35.233
<i>A small piece of
space... they call it junk</i>

00:35.234 --> 00:38.384
<i>- -had been causing a big
headache for NASA scientists...</i>

00:38.385 --> 00:42.345
<i>Houston is monitoring a piece
of debris that could possibly</i>

00:42.346 --> 00:45.506
<i>pass in front of the International
Space Station's orbit...</i>

00:45.507 --> 00:47.567
<i>talking about this
6" square piece...</i>

00:48.702 --> 00:51.374
<i>of it colliding with the
International Space Station</i>

00:51.375 --> 00:55.046
<i>is within the red threshold.
There is not enough time...</i>

00:55.047 --> 00:56.328
<i>to seek shelter...</i>

00:58.210 --> 01:00.993
<i>travelling at
17,000 miles an hour...</i>

01:00.994 --> 01:03.897
<i>if it were to hit
the space station...</i>

01:03.898 --> 01:04.983
<i>could do a little damage...</i>

01:04.983 --> 01:06.504
<i>could really cause
a very bad day...</i>

01:12.646 --> 01:20.646
<i>6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0...</i>

01:44.141 --> 01:45.430
<i>The eagle has landed.</i>

01:48.107 --> 01:53.109
<i>It's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.</i>

01:54.746 --> 01:57.801
After half a century
of space exploration,

01:58.302 --> 02:04.657
we're now suddenly faced with what's
long been a staple of science fiction:

02:04.658 --> 02:08.797
an orbiting junkyard of
cast-off space debris.

02:35.207 --> 02:38.575
The American southwest is
a breathtaking testament

02:38.576 --> 02:41.944
to the forces of nature
that have shaped our world.

02:50.741 --> 02:53.554
<i>OK. We're comin' up on it now.</i>

02:56.021 --> 02:59.400
This is Meteor Crater
near Winslow, Arizona.

02:59.401 --> 03:03.951
It is considered the world's best
preserved meteorite impact site.

03:40.800 --> 03:45.392
Meet Donald Kessler, retired
head of orbital debris at NASA.

03:46.110 --> 03:48.550
His guide, Eduardo Gonzales...

03:48.551 --> 03:52.564
A 16-year veteran of Meteor
Crater and a man who shares

03:52.565 --> 03:55.577
Kessler's passion for the
wonders of the universe...

03:55.578 --> 03:57.181
<i>So Don, how was your ride up here?</i>

03:57.182 --> 03:59.605
<i>Oh, it was wonderful! It
was like landing on the moon!</i>

03:59.606 --> 04:02.104
<i>But we're on earth! Can you believe it?</i>

04:02.105 --> 04:06.037
At Meteor Crater, they
always find common ground.

04:06.038 --> 04:10.957
<i>Result of a collision from the Asteroid
Belt that happened 50,000 years ago...</i>

04:11.450 --> 04:14.084
For Don, this place
brings some of the science

04:14.085 --> 04:17.807
of orbital debris to life in a big way.

04:17.808 --> 04:19.524
<i>Follow me and I'll show you.</i>

04:25.827 --> 04:33.309
Nearly 1 mile across, 2.5
miles around and 550 feet deep,

04:33.310 --> 04:37.586
Meteor Crater is the astounding
outcome of a nickel-iron meteorite

04:37.587 --> 04:43.262
hitting earth with the energy of
more than 20 million tonnes of TNT,

04:43.263 --> 04:47.673
creating all of this in just 10 seconds.

05:33.500 --> 05:38.591
<i>The fact that this meteorite came
from outer space makes me awestruck.</i>

05:40.650 --> 05:43.321
<i>We're just seeing a
small slice of the process</i>

05:43.322 --> 05:45.404
<i>that really made the Earth what it is.</i>

05:56.836 --> 05:59.616
It's a sobering reminder
of the incredible collisions

05:59.617 --> 06:01.470
that occur throughout the universe,

06:01.471 --> 06:07.384
from meteor impacts like this one
to the collision of entire galaxies.

06:19.177 --> 06:24.610
Throughout time, space collisions have
occurred as part of the natural process.

06:25.946 --> 06:29.364
Scientist believe that
billions of years from now,

06:29.365 --> 06:34.582
our own Milky Way galaxy and its closest
neighbour, the Andromeda Spiral Galaxy,

06:34.583 --> 06:40.150
could collide and merge to create
a new giant elliptical galaxy,

06:40.151 --> 06:42.918
spewing stars along the way.

06:43.650 --> 06:44.666
Incredible...

07:12.050 --> 07:15.488
Collisions like this have
forever played a major role

07:15.489 --> 07:18.926
in the creation and formation
of our own Solar System.

07:18.927 --> 07:24.416
It's this natural process that
concerned Kessler over 30 years ago.

07:35.300 --> 07:39.918
If all of these
collisions are occurring in nature,

07:39.919 --> 07:44.798
what's going to happen to all of the
man-made objects we're putting into space?

07:49.050 --> 07:53.280
At the time, Kessler's thinking
did not align with popular beliefs.

07:53.550 --> 07:59.339
Ever since human ventured into space,
we've embraced the Big Sky Theory.

08:01.006 --> 08:03.897
The theory holds that
the space is so big,

08:03.898 --> 08:08.788
you could launch anything into orbit and
it wouldn't collide with anything else.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.299
But it turns out that space
is smaller than we thought.

08:12.300 --> 08:17.410
Low-Earth Orbit, or LEO as it's called,
is home to the International Space Station,

08:17.411 --> 08:20.321
the Hubble Telescope and
most of our satellites.

08:22.050 --> 08:26.325
In Middle-Earth Orbit, we find
GPS and weather satellites.

08:37.450 --> 08:42.875
Geosynchronous Orbit, or GEO, the
orbit farthest away from the Earth,

08:42.876 --> 08:46.700
is crowded with
communication satellites.

08:48.700 --> 08:51.826
With so many objects careening
through the same altitudes,

08:51.827 --> 08:56.353
it's not hard to imagine that
some may eventually collide.

09:07.100 --> 09:10.650
Known as the Kessler
Syndrome, Kessler's prediction

09:10.651 --> 09:14.400
stated that random collisions
between man-made objects

09:14.401 --> 09:20.878
would create smaller debris that would
become increasingly hazardous to spacecraft.

09:21.863 --> 09:28.510
The resulting chain reaction would create
exponentially expanding clouds of debris.

09:30.950 --> 09:33.859
Even if we don't launch
anything else into space,

09:33.860 --> 09:40.769
this orbiting belt of debris could very
well alter space exploration as we know it.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.617
Is it possible that we're
now at the tipping point

09:47.618 --> 09:51.385
of this cascading, uncontrollable event?

09:55.400 --> 09:59.808
Alarmingly, in the three decades
since Donald Kessler's prediction,

09:59.809 --> 10:03.684
the amount of debris in
Low-Earth and Geosynchronous Orbit

10:03.685 --> 10:10.760
has grown at a rapidly expanding rate
into a minefield of discarded trash.

10:13.650 --> 10:19.889
<i>In the past, most of the small particles
came from the bigger objects falling apart.</i>

10:19.890 --> 10:23.483
<i>In the future, and we're
reaching that threshold right now,</i>

10:23.484 --> 10:28.758
<i>the objects are gonna come random
collisions, just like in the Solar System.</i>

10:30.550 --> 10:33.979
Just like our one Sun-spoiled
ecosystems here on earth,

10:33.980 --> 10:37.408
our orbits are becoming
increasingly endangered.

10:37.409 --> 10:41.291
From space exploration to
satellite communication,

10:41.292 --> 10:44.773
humans have developed a
profound connection to space.

10:44.774 --> 10:48.661
What would happen if it
were all to suddenly go away?

10:49.550 --> 10:54.680
Launched in 1993, Cosmos
2251 provides communications

10:54.681 --> 10:59.810
for Russian military and intelligence
forces from Low-Earth Orbit.

10:59.811 --> 11:04.599
Satellites like this are part of
what's called "a constellation,"

11:04.600 --> 11:08.967
a grouping of satellites spread
out in a set of orbital rings

11:08.968 --> 11:12.934
providing an uninterrupted
stream of communications,

11:12.935 --> 11:15.978
with each rotation in
as little as 90 minutes.

11:15.979 --> 11:22.432
These and thousands of other
satellites orbit earth 16 times per day.

11:24.450 --> 11:28.476
The gravitational pull from
nearby earth is so strong,

11:28.477 --> 11:32.502
every satellite has to travel
at hyper-velocity speeds,

11:32.503 --> 11:35.789
upwards of 17,000 miles per hour.

11:35.790 --> 11:39.531
The pull of gravity, balanced
against the satellite's velocity,

11:39.532 --> 11:43.272
creates this curved orbital path.

11:54.200 --> 11:59.400
Satellites and their around-the-clock
services are a fact of modern life.

12:01.400 --> 12:06.500
LEO is ideal for communication
satellites like Iridium 33,

12:06.501 --> 12:10.600
which provides voice and data
coverage for cellular telephones.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.426
With satellites like Cosmos and Iridium
constantly crossing each other's paths,

12:18.427 --> 12:24.645
they often experience what satellite
operators refer to as "close approaches",

12:24.646 --> 12:29.064
two satellites passing within just
a few short miles of one another.

12:29.065 --> 12:33.912
Amazingly, that can happen
around 150 times a day.

12:33.913 --> 12:37.183
Space is indeed a busy place.

12:42.800 --> 12:47.914
Our planet's need for communication
has transformed what was once called

12:47.915 --> 12:54.828
"the Final Frontier" into something far
less romantic and far more congested.

12:55.050 --> 12:59.537
Just 50 years ago, the
boundary seemed limitless.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.687
From a ground station nestled in
the mountains of Andover, Maine,

13:07.688 --> 13:10.324
a signal is sent to
a speeding satellite.

13:10.325 --> 13:13.793
An historic feat, that
could reshape man's future...

13:13.794 --> 13:16.889
That satellite of course is the Telstar.

13:16.890 --> 13:22.538
170 pounds of messages and computer data
all can be handled by the orbiting device.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.580
Ironically, this technological
wonder dies one year later,

13:27.581 --> 13:31.161
becoming as what is known
as a "zombie satellite."

13:34.000 --> 13:37.685
Telstar began the
revolution in communications

13:37.686 --> 13:42.370
that now features a fleet of
satellites in the region we know as GEO.

13:43.100 --> 13:48.055
These satellites form a densely
populated belt that circles the Equator.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.325
They facilitate most of
the world's television,

13:58.326 --> 14:01.378
military and internet communications.

14:01.379 --> 14:04.309
Because its orbit
mirrors earth's rotation,

14:04.310 --> 14:08.640
a satellite will appear to hover
over a point on the earth's surface.

14:09.300 --> 14:15.829
The result? 24/7 continuous
coverage from air to sea, to land...

14:21.650 --> 14:22.892
Think about this:

14:22.893 --> 14:27.207
Here on earth when you download
a music file, host a video,

14:27.208 --> 14:31.521
tweet, friend someone, or watch
your favourite cable TV show,

14:31.522 --> 14:33.245
it's coming from GEO.

14:41.550 --> 14:46.860
Our busy lives on earth have
become deeply connected to space.

14:53.950 --> 14:59.445
Just like a coral reef or a rainforest,
GEO is a limited natural resource.

14:59.446 --> 15:04.230
There's only one spot in GEO for
each satellite to maintain position.

15:04.231 --> 15:08.133
Satellites may drift due
to gravitational pull from

15:08.134 --> 15:12.235
both the Sun and the Moon,
slowly changing their orbits.

15:12.236 --> 15:17.275
Enter station keepers,
traffic cops of space...

15:17.276 --> 15:21.009
They send signals commanding
satellites to adjust orbits,

15:21.010 --> 15:23.342
by firing up the onboard thrusters,

15:23.343 --> 15:25.668
keeping them out of harm's way.

15:25.669 --> 15:29.293
But no amount of station keeping
would have altered the course

15:29.294 --> 15:34.318
of what was to become the largest
debris-generating event on record.

15:38.178 --> 15:43.729
In early 2007, an anti-satellite
missile test took place in LEO.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.698
Its target? A dead weather satellite...

16:23.600 --> 16:27.718
In less than 24 hours, the
debris encircled the earth,

16:27.719 --> 16:32.036
hovering at the original impact
altitude of over 500 miles,

16:32.037 --> 16:36.361
high enough so that the pieces
won't come down, but low enough

16:36.362 --> 16:41.886
so that they have the potential to affect
almost all other objects in Low-Earth Orbit,

16:41.887 --> 16:45.248
including the
International Space Station.

16:45.800 --> 16:51.618
Today, as the debris cloud keeps
growing, so does our understanding of it.

16:51.619 --> 16:54.444
The majority of debris
from this one event

16:54.445 --> 16:59.269
will remain a hazard in our
skies for centuries to come.

17:13.500 --> 17:18.185
This visualisation shows the
formation of one of the first galaxies,

17:18.185 --> 17:22.058
massive stars filling
the universe with light,

17:22.059 --> 17:25.766
beginning when it was
300 million years old,

17:25.767 --> 17:32.606
and continuing up to its present
age of 13.7 billion years.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.868
It's an awe-inspiring look at
the lifespan of the universe,

17:38.869 --> 17:42.258
with galaxies forming,
and naturally colliding...

17:42.259 --> 17:47.859
Ultimately spinning the massive
thread-like structure of the cosmic web...

18:26.300 --> 18:32.538
At Lowell Observatory, Don Kessler is guided
by Kim Herman, post-doctoral associate.

18:35.550 --> 18:37.874
<i>Arizona's known for
its observatories, and</i>

18:37.875 --> 18:41.927
<i>fortunately very close to
Meteor Crater is Lowell.</i>

18:42.800 --> 18:45.744
<i>All my life I've been
interested in astronomy.</i>

18:46.550 --> 18:50.297
<i>I've visited several
observatories that were designed</i>

18:50.298 --> 18:55.031
<i>for the purpose of looking at
satellites, but never one with astronomy.</i>

18:56.500 --> 18:59.515
<i>Here astronomers are
well-connected to the stars.</i>

19:08.600 --> 19:12.747
Bordered by a ponderosa
pine forest 8,000 feet up,

19:12.748 --> 19:17.342
elevation and absolute
isolation create a pristine sky

19:17.343 --> 19:21.654
for professional and amateur
astronomers of all ages.

19:31.950 --> 19:36.795
The night sky here opens up infinite
possibilities for the naked eye.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.499
<i>Here the sky is so clear
and so dark that we don't</i>

19:44.500 --> 19:48.128
<i>even need telescopes to see
what's going on in the sky.</i>

19:49.550 --> 19:54.235
<i>Eyum is using her smartphone to
stargaze and know what she's looking at.</i>

19:54.236 --> 19:57.192
<i>And over there Saturn
should be coming out.</i>

20:01.400 --> 20:04.671
<i>When I think about Saturn's
beautiful rings, I think of collisions</i>

20:04.672 --> 20:08.439
<i>in space and what earth could look
like millions of years from now.</i>

20:08.440 --> 20:14.707
Overtime, collisions would create more
debris and in turn even more collisions.

20:20.300 --> 20:26.319
Gradually, the debris would shrink in
size and speeds would slow until finally

20:26.320 --> 20:31.243
the Earth would be surrounded
by stable, Saturn-like rings.

20:36.815 --> 20:40.260
<i>When I look at the night sky the
first thing I notice is stars.</i>

20:40.261 --> 20:43.404
<i>The beauty of the
universe is striking to me.</i>

20:46.300 --> 20:49.108
<i>The next thing I'll notice is meteors.</i>

20:49.109 --> 20:52.091
<i>If I see a meteor I feel
like I'm lucky, because that</i>

20:52.092 --> 20:55.530
<i>also reminds me of these
particles passing through space.</i>

20:56.550 --> 20:59.461
<i>Then I may notice something
flickering and moving</i>

20:59.462 --> 21:02.525
<i>and realise that I'm looking at
a satellite orbiting the Earth.</i>

21:02.526 --> 21:06.107
<i>Those satellites are there
because we put them there.</i>

21:06.108 --> 21:09.020
<i>And I may see another one,
travelling in the opposite direction.</i>

21:09.021 --> 21:12.596
<i>It could collide with the
first one; their paths do cross.</i>

21:12.597 --> 21:15.192
<i>An astronaut was asked this question:</i>

21:15.193 --> 21:19.050
<i>When you're in orbit and see these
things in space, does that worry you?</i>

21:19.051 --> 21:22.956
<i>I worry
more about what I don't see.</i>

21:25.900 --> 21:30.940
Our belief that what goes up
must come down isn't always true.

21:30.941 --> 21:36.330
It's estimated that LEO contains
6000 tonnes of space junk,

21:36.331 --> 21:43.072
and GEO is home to 400 dead satellites,
parked into a higher graveyard orbit,

21:43.073 --> 21:45.981
where they will remain
for hundreds of years.

21:45.982 --> 21:48.125
That's a whole lot of junk.

22:01.500 --> 22:04.513
So what exactly is out there?

22:05.600 --> 22:10.450
Over the last 50 years, we've launched
several thousand objects into space.

22:10.451 --> 22:15.808
Yet there are only around 1000 spacecraft
that are operational at this time.

22:15.809 --> 22:18.464
What may surprise many people is that

22:18.465 --> 22:22.555
once an object stops
functioning, we leave it in orbit.

22:22.556 --> 22:29.490
Every single one of these non-operational
spacecraft is a potential source of debris.

22:30.359 --> 22:34.390
In fact, most spacecraft that
are launched into the orbit

22:34.391 --> 22:37.738
actually leave a trail
of debris in the process.

22:37.739 --> 22:42.252
Upper-stage rocket bodies
weighing several tonnes

22:42.553 --> 22:45.952
make up a good portion of junk in space.

22:53.900 --> 22:59.053
As do mission-related objects
like cast-off bolts, or o-rings...

23:01.900 --> 23:06.965
The rest, of miscellaneous fragments,
exploded rockets, left-over fuel...

23:06.966 --> 23:09.174
And the list goes on...

23:22.300 --> 23:25.404
But even with this
incredible amount of debris,

23:25.405 --> 23:29.226
few people were taking the
notion of space junk seriously

23:29.227 --> 23:33.207
until the morning of February 10, 2009.

23:36.300 --> 23:39.877
Earlier that day, a report
was issued predicting that

23:39.878 --> 23:45.059
Iridium 33 would encounter a
close approach of just 1900 feet

23:45.060 --> 23:47.068
with another spacecraft.

23:51.949 --> 23:58.278
It's Cosmos 2251, travelling
at the same speed as Iridium.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.319
Amazingly, this collision
alert wasn't even among the top

24:03.320 --> 24:07.039
predicted for any of the Iridium
satellites for the coming week.

24:08.784 --> 24:16.784
But at 4:56 PM, the time predicted for
the close approach, Iridium 33 went silent.

24:32.300 --> 24:38.705
Two satellites that had simultaneously
circled the planet for a dozen years

24:38.706 --> 24:40.258
had collided.

24:40.900 --> 24:43.897
Cosmos, as it turned
out, was a dead satellite,

24:43.898 --> 24:48.799
ceasing to function in 1995, just
two years after it was launched.

24:51.800 --> 24:58.521
Now more than a 100,000 pieces from
this collision cloud Low-Earth Orbit.

25:01.900 --> 25:05.662
<i>The Iridium-Cosmos collision
was very much a game changer.</i>

25:05.663 --> 25:09.154
<i>There were those who thought of
space in terms of a Big Sky Theory,</i>

25:09.155 --> 25:13.406
<i>that it was limitless and we didn't
need to worry about ever crowding it.</i>

25:14.180 --> 25:18.795
<i>It became very obvious that that wasn't
true and people began to consider:</i>

25:18.796 --> 25:21.804
<i>What do we need to do to keep
this from happening again?</i>

25:32.600 --> 25:37.203
Far from space, deep in the desert
near White Sands, New Mexico,

25:37.204 --> 25:40.603
sits the remote
hyper-velocity test laboratory,

25:40.604 --> 25:44.838
where engineers are providing
solutions required to advance

25:44.839 --> 25:49.102
space travel in the face of
these gathering obstacles.

25:51.600 --> 25:57.781
Scientists analyze what we can only
hyper-velocity impacts,

25:57.782 --> 26:04.593
collisions between objects travelling
at speeds of up to 15,000 miles per hour.

26:16.040 --> 26:21.200
These scientific visualisations show
a fragment no bigger than a beebee...

26:22.433 --> 26:27.625
blasting through an aluminium plate,
typically used to protect spacecraft.

26:27.626 --> 26:33.004
Even the smallest of impacts scatter
debris, delivering wide-spread damage.

26:34.562 --> 26:39.623
Whether it's a circuit board or a wayward
bolt, or even the tiniest chip of paint,

26:39.624 --> 26:44.316
orbital debris travelling at these
speeds poses a very real threat.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.839
Because of this, the International
Space Station features extra shielding,

26:53.840 --> 26:58.254
as shown in red, over the
areas most likely to be hit.

27:02.400 --> 27:06.111
To further protect the
ISS, its orbit is monitored

27:06.112 --> 27:09.008
within what is referred
to as a "pizza box,"

27:09.009 --> 27:14.034
creating a safe zone on all sides
to help keep it out of harm's way.

27:14.035 --> 27:17.908
That's the job of the US
Space Surveillance Network,

27:17.909 --> 27:21.562
where they detect and
catalogue man-made objects.

27:24.900 --> 27:28.418
Utilising a vast array
of RADARs and sensors,

27:28.419 --> 27:33.843
we're able to track thousands of pieces
of space junk larger than a softball.

27:36.100 --> 27:40.524
Some of them, like rocket boosters,
are the size of a school bus.

27:40.800 --> 27:47.181
But what's far more troubling is
all the debris that can't be tracked.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.947
Debris the size of marbles,
among them waste from

27:55.948 --> 28:01.599
rocket propellant and
fragments from collisions,

28:01.600 --> 28:04.762
is capable of inflicting lethal damage.

28:13.050 --> 28:17.994
Millions of particles the size
of darts are far beyond detection.

28:22.150 --> 28:26.914
But the craters they produce on
spacecraft are well-documented.

28:36.900 --> 28:41.538
Most importantly, the network
charts the orbital paths of the

28:41.539 --> 28:46.476
catalogued debris and issues
collision alerts to station keepers.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.670
So where do we go from here?

28:56.671 --> 29:01.982
Forces of nature and natural collisions
will continue to shape our universe.

29:01.983 --> 29:04.200
But man-made collisions?

29:04.501 --> 29:07.988
Perhaps those we can
do something about...

29:20.128 --> 29:24.085
<i>The good news is that people have
begun to come up with new ideas to</i>

29:24.086 --> 29:27.822
<i>bring back the pristine environment
that we would like space to be.</i>

29:29.240 --> 29:33.947
Scientists and engineers are
developing breakthrough innovations to

29:33.948 --> 29:37.496
help us begin cleaning
up space someday soon.

29:39.174 --> 29:42.940
How do we
catch up to and capture

29:42.941 --> 29:47.096
debris tumbling through Low-Earth
Orbit at thousands of miles an hour?

29:47.097 --> 29:49.405
And then, how do we slow it down,

29:49.406 --> 29:53.810
so that it falls out of orbit
and burns up in the atmosphere?

29:56.566 --> 30:01.709
One fascinating concept involves
the use of electro-dynamic tether,

30:01.710 --> 30:05.468
which would deal with the
spacecraft by generating drag,

30:05.469 --> 30:10.736
through interactions between currents in
the tether and the Earth's magnetic field.

30:20.538 --> 30:24.959
This increased drag would lower
the spacecraft out of orbit

30:24.960 --> 30:28.496
until it re-enters the
atmosphere and burns up.

30:34.462 --> 30:38.078
We may also be able to
capture debris with a net.

30:40.306 --> 30:44.728
Japan's Space Agency has been working
with a fishing net manufacturer

30:44.729 --> 30:48.960
to look at creating a "space
fishing net," which, like the tether,

30:48.961 --> 30:52.447
could be powered using
the earth's magnetosphere.

30:58.496 --> 30:59.569
Imagine that...

30:59.570 --> 31:02.557
A centuries-old fishing
tool might just become

31:02.558 --> 31:05.470
a brand-new tool for cleaning up space.

31:11.352 --> 31:15.645
Lasers could one day sweep
space, striking smaller objects,

31:15.646 --> 31:19.948
slowing them down and causing
them to tumble into the atmosphere.

31:32.300 --> 31:36.489
Solar sails could someday be
part of the satellites we launch,

31:36.490 --> 31:40.412
helping them to de-orbit once
their work in space is done.

31:40.413 --> 31:45.916
Space-faring nations are now working
to develop sustainable methods to

31:45.917 --> 31:51.574
explore space and new technology to
reclaim what has been left in orbit.

31:56.950 --> 32:01.548
As we continue to launch our
dreams into space, what if one day

32:01.549 --> 32:06.218
objects in space were located
and captured by a garbage vehicle?

32:19.100 --> 32:22.992
The vehicle could then dock
at a recycling facility,

32:22.993 --> 32:29.642
a place where space debris could be
stored and recycled to create new parts.

32:35.198 --> 32:36.248
Imagine...

32:36.249 --> 32:40.107
Aluminium and fuel from
centuries old upper-stage rockets

32:40.108 --> 32:44.911
recovered and poured into an
industrial outer space post...

32:53.600 --> 32:56.865
<i>Industrialising space is never
and issue of science fiction.</i>

32:56.866 --> 32:59.570
<i>It's more of a question
of do we want to do it and</i>

32:59.571 --> 33:03.252
<i>when do we have the infrastructure
established so that we can do it.</i>

33:04.250 --> 33:07.879
<i>It's work we will do in the
future as move out into space.</i>

33:10.218 --> 33:14.576
Space-based recycling could
someday become a reality,

33:14.577 --> 33:19.080
launching a new, greener
era of space exploration.

33:27.858 --> 33:30.844
For as long as humans
have walked the planet,

33:30.845 --> 33:35.519
we've looked at the heavens to help
us define our role in the universe.

33:35.800 --> 33:41.000
The celestial bodies in our skies
and the constellations they form

33:41.001 --> 33:45.487
have forever shaped our
notions of time and place.

33:45.488 --> 33:50.523
Today, constellations of our
own making fill the night skies

33:50.524 --> 33:56.128
as we continue to push skyward, relying
on what the universe has taught us.

33:56.129 --> 34:01.238
Where would we be, if we
couldn't consult the stars?

34:05.650 --> 34:09.213
<i>Growing up, it was my fantasy
that I would get to see humanity</i>

34:09.214 --> 34:12.103
<i>spread off of the Earth and
throughout the Solar System.</i>

34:12.103 --> 34:15.826
<i>So do I think this snowballing
event will actually happen?</i>

34:15.827 --> 34:19.143
<i>I can't imagine after
dreaming and working toward</i>

34:19.145 --> 34:22.179
<i>space flight and after 50
years of having achieved it,</i>

34:22.179 --> 34:24.856
<i>that we would ever cut
ourselves off from space.</i>

34:24.857 --> 34:29.844
<i>That does against everything that
humanity has ever strived for.</i>

34:29.844 --> 34:34.577
<i>My legacy will probably always include
being knows as the father of "space junk."</i>

34:34.578 --> 34:37.803
<i>What I hope that means is
that we continue to maintain</i>

34:37.804 --> 34:43.391
<i>access to space and learn more
about life and the environment.</i>
