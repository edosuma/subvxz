WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:15.224
We at the Wells Foundation are so proud

00:15.307 --> 00:19.520
to help build a student arts center
for our underserved communities.

00:19.603 --> 00:23.190
As Maya Angelou said,
"You can't use up creativity.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.109
The more you use, the more you have."

00:26.193 --> 00:28.070
We're happy to give all the kids of LA

00:28.153 --> 00:30.197
a place to find their voices.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.659
And we are so excited
to have some entertainment

00:33.742 --> 00:35.827
from my favorite dance crew.

00:35.911 --> 00:39.873
Let's give it up
for the Cerritos Smooth Grooves!

00:56.723 --> 00:57.891
You want me to join?

00:57.975 --> 00:59.726
- Okay. I guess--
- Get in there, cuz.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.396
I guess you need me, right? Watch this.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.569
Should I do that?

01:09.194 --> 01:12.906
Hey. You lost me on that part actually.

01:12.990 --> 01:13.991
No, no, no.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.701
That's a little dangerous. That's--

01:15.784 --> 01:17.286
Is that okay for their necks?

01:17.828 --> 01:19.580
Do we have a-- No, and nobody's--

01:20.330 --> 01:21.707
He seems fine.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.627
I'm gonna support you from over here.
How about that?

01:33.302 --> 01:38.223
<i>Bonjour, Jean-Pierre. Comment allez-vous?
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici?</i>

01:38.307 --> 01:39.516
What, you do speak French?

01:42.352 --> 01:44.521
That's a little too advanced for me.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.274
Did you say something about a long tongue?

01:48.984 --> 01:49.985
Close.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.239
Stop sweating. Stop sweating.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.285
You. Go get me a fan,
or I'll kill you! Go!

01:59.912 --> 02:01.580
What brings you to Cerritos?

02:01.663 --> 02:04.333
I was on my way
to a windmill farm I own in Palm Desert,

02:04.416 --> 02:06.627
and my people mentioned this to me,
so I came.

02:07.252 --> 02:10.005
Well, thank you so much for coming.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.798
As I told you before,
we should find something

02:11.882 --> 02:13.926
- to work on together.
- Yes, absolutely.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.887
Would you like to have dinner
with me sometime?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.392
- Yes. Sure. I would love that.
- Great.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.393
Great.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.397
<i>À bientôt, Molly.</i>

02:27.481 --> 02:29.566
Wow, my name sounds so good in French.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.651
Molly.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.571
Can you just say it for me one more time?

02:35.239 --> 02:36.240
Molly.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.201
It's still good.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.704
- I have to go now.
- Yes. You have to go.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.914
Of course. Okay.

02:45.958 --> 02:46.959
Bye.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.460
- You are so dewy.
- Oh, my God.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.546
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
making this up to you.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.297
- I'm so sorry.
- Do I smell weird?

02:52.381 --> 02:54.091
No. You smell incredible actually.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.926
I think he caused me to start ovulating.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.308
You guys are crazy.
He does not like me in that way.

03:44.391 --> 03:48.770
Honestly, no, I-- Guys like that date,
like, models or Baldwin daughters.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.273
Please. The man followed you to Cerritos.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.818
The only people who go to Cerritos
are in love or trapped in a trunk.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.279
No, he just wants to work together.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.449
- I think you like him.
- Come on. I just met him.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.534
I agree with Nicholas.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.662
Your aura is orange, the color of arousal.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.916
Well, either way, we should be careful.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.001
I mean, we don't know
if he's plotting some sort of ransom

04:11.084 --> 04:13.295
or some sort of <i>Taken</i>-style kidnapping.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.798
If Hollywood has taught me anything,
it's don't trust Europeans.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.216
Yeah, I agree.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.969
I mean, what do we really know
about this guy?

04:21.053 --> 04:23.805
Jean-Pierre.
Who needs two first names?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.224
It's a little greedy.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.975
Okay, it is so stupid
to be wasting time on this.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.852
He probably has a girlfriend anyways.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.939
Well, we can find that out.
Let's check his socials.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.775
That's my family.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.279
- I'm sorry we're all white.
- Yeah.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.365
- Yeah.
- Is there any work going on here?

04:41.448 --> 04:44.201
Yeah. We're looking up a hot guy
to see if he's single.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.287
Slide over, Ainsley.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.002
Okay, not married.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.381
Red flag at over 40s,
but not bad for a billionaire.

04:57.881 --> 05:02.094
No bankruptcies.
Friend group pretty diverse.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.263
Nothing on Reddit.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.682
And there's a picture
of him with Ashton Kutcher.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.604
- I'll allow it.
- Okay.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.690
He broke up with his girlfriend
nine months ago.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.775
What? How could you possibly know that?

05:16.859 --> 05:18.360
Look at his photo history.

05:18.443 --> 05:24.074
Gabrielle, Gabrielle, Gabrielle,
dog photo, dog photo, marathon.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.202
Yeah. Your boy got his heart broken,
but he's back at it now.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.163
Wow.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.833
What?

05:32.916 --> 05:35.169
I've had a lot of exes.
I live for this shit.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.423
- What?
- He just texted me.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.259
He invited me up
to his vineyard for dinner.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.346
Okay, now, cuz,
if he takes you, do not resist.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.807
Use your sense of smell
to figure out what city you're in,

05:48.891 --> 05:50.392
and get a message out.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.144
We will find you.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.146
Okay. Okay. That's good.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.944
No. We need everything.
We need day looks, night looks,

06:01.028 --> 06:04.781
sunrise looks, sunset looks,
vineyard chic, vineyard casual.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.909
Just bring it all, Javier.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.494
What's this?

06:09.578 --> 06:11.997
It's a present for getting the part
in the play. Congratulations, man.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.123
- I'm proud of you.
- Oh, my God.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.625
Howard, you didn't have to do this.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.711
I mean, it's such a small part.
It, like, barely matters.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.004
Come on, now.

06:20.339 --> 06:23.634
A "<i>Respect for Acting</i>,"
"<i>An Actor Prepares</i>,"

06:23.717 --> 06:27.513
and a bunch of printed-out tweets

06:27.596 --> 06:28.972
from Randy Quaid.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.016
Well, some of them are about acting,

06:31.099 --> 06:33.977
and some of them are about being
a fugitive from a government conspiracy.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.188
It is not clear which is which.

06:36.271 --> 06:40.692
"You must behave truthfully,
even under imaginary circumstances."

06:40.776 --> 06:41.818
See?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.488
Howard, one of the reasons I'm so hot

06:44.571 --> 06:47.699
is because I'm emotionally unavailable
to everyone around me.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.202
- It's one of your best qualities.
- But…

06:50.285 --> 06:53.997
what you did for me with the play,
it really meant a lot to me.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.252
It's been nice getting to know you, Goku.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.837
I'm glad you said it,

07:00.337 --> 07:02.464
because now I need you
to be a supportive friend

07:02.548 --> 07:04.132
and meet my girlfriend, Tanya.

07:04.883 --> 07:08.679
Okay, see,
what you've just done is trap me,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.014
and I respect it.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.975
- I knew what I was doing!
- Yeah, yeah.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.601
Anyways, set up a time.

07:14.685 --> 07:19.022
Way ahead of you.
Tonight, 4:15 p.m., Cheesecake Factory.

07:32.703 --> 07:33.871
- Hey. Sorry…
- Hi.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.205
…this might not be the best time.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.416
- I just need you to take a look at this.
- No, no.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.294
Come in. Actually, this is a great time.
I need a break.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.088
You're really gonna serve up some lewks.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.174
Sorry, I should not have said that.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.800
Oh, my God,
this is so embarrassing.

07:46.884 --> 07:50.345
I'm going to the vineyard
to meet Jean-Pierre,

07:50.429 --> 07:52.848
and I have no idea what to wear.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.683
And I'm sorry
'cause this is really boring,

07:54.766 --> 07:56.351
and I don't know
why I'm boring you with this.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.103
I'm spiraling.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.814
No, don't worry. I completely understand.

08:00.898 --> 08:05.611
I went on my first post-divorce date,
and I stared at my closet for an hour.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.280
- Yeah.
- And then I figured it out.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.240
Blue shirt, khakis and a tie.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.367
So exactly what you're wearing right now?

08:14.036 --> 08:16.455
Yes. Guess so.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.789
It's just that,

08:17.873 --> 08:20.125
I don't even know if this is a date,
you know?

08:20.209 --> 08:22.211
And I'm kind of freaking out.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.171
Well, you know what they say in hiking.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.589
I definitely don't.

08:26.215 --> 08:29.009
Wear layers. Be prepared for anything.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.303
That's actually a really interesting idea.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.639
I think I can work with that.

08:33.722 --> 08:34.722
Okay.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.183
And listen.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.395
Whatever you end up choosing,
you're gonna look great.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.525
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.537
Move, madam.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.332
There is a fucking rat down there.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.544
A fucking rat! Can you believe it?

09:49.464 --> 09:51.091
-<i>Bonjour, </i>Molly.
- Hi.

09:51.175 --> 09:53.677
I'd love to give you a hug,
but I'm covered in grease…

09:53.760 --> 09:55.304
Me too.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.389
- You are?
- No.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.473
I mean, no.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.475
I just came from work too.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.354
These machines are very old,
and they break down all the time,

10:04.438 --> 10:06.190
but they give us such a great wine.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.775
Sorry, just give me a moment,
and I'll be free.

10:08.859 --> 10:12.029
Yes, yes. Take your time.
Get back to your wrenching.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.618
Be careful, madam.
That area is full of rats!

10:17.701 --> 10:18.702
Oh, God.

10:27.336 --> 10:28.462
Actually, I called ahead

10:28.545 --> 10:30.547
and requested a basket
of just brown bread.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.509
Howard J. Wilson. I spoke with Elizabeth.

10:34.218 --> 10:35.802
I did not say, "Take that one."

10:37.679 --> 10:39.097
Thank you.

10:39.181 --> 10:41.642
No, I don't eat bread
for religious reasons.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.769
I wanna look as fit as Jesus.

10:43.852 --> 10:44.937
I see that.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.813
There she is.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.565
Nicholas,
let me introduce you to my love--

10:48.649 --> 10:50.192
Fuck you, motherfucker. Don't touch me.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.151
Hi, I'm Nicholas.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.654
Howard, what in the hell are you doing
liking Danielle's Instagram post

10:53.737 --> 10:55.322
when she's basically wearing nothing?

10:55.405 --> 10:57.824
I like everything in my feed.
I'm a good follow.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.702
- So you're gonna lie to my face?
- You guys seem like you're going through--

11:00.786 --> 11:02.162
Sit your ass down!

11:02.704 --> 11:04.873
- Yes, ma'am.
- I like a audience. Move.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.090
- I got the brown bread for you.
- They ain't got no plates?

11:13.799 --> 11:16.635
Can we get-- We need plates over here!

11:24.726 --> 11:27.521
- So sorry about that.
- No, please. Not at all.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.815
This room is much more beautiful anyway.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.027
So, you really have a thing
for horses, huh?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.196
I love horses.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.824
I spent two years working
as a ranch hand in Spain.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.077
That's a surprising job
for a billionaire's kid.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.913
In my youth,
I rejected my family's wealth.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.164
Lived on my own.

11:46.248 --> 11:50.210
I was a rancher, a bartender,
and even a boxer.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.796
- Seriously, a boxer?
- Yeah, seven knockouts.

11:53.714 --> 11:54.965
That's amazing.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.342
I was the one being knocked out.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.305
But what changed for you?

12:01.388 --> 12:02.931
Why aren't you off somewhere
getting beat up?

12:03.015 --> 12:04.933
When my grandfather died,
before passing on,

12:05.017 --> 12:07.436
he asked me
to keep our family's name alive.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.147
I thought helping people
will be the best way to do that.

12:10.772 --> 12:14.902
I owe him everything.
He gave my life meaning, you know?

12:15.944 --> 12:17.070
That's impressive.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.490
I know a lot of rich people,
and most of them don't think that way.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.117
But you do.

12:24.328 --> 12:25.996
Can I tell you something?

12:26.914 --> 12:28.040
Sure.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.209
I had no reason to be in Cerritos.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.086
I made up an excuse.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.422
I came out there specifically to find you.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.800
- Really?
- Yes.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.930
Would you like to go outside
and have a glass of wine?

12:43.013 --> 12:44.264
Yes, I would love that.

12:44.348 --> 12:45.349
Okay, come.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.061
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

13:15.212 --> 13:18.841
Just admit. You liked that post
because Danielle looks hot in that bikini

13:18.924 --> 13:20.717
even though her toe's all jacked up.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.053
She was at a beach volleyball tournament.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.848
- I support women in sports.
- This.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.058
This is why I want
to put a dog chip in you.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.644
Well, go ahead.
I got nothing to hide. You know what?

13:30.727 --> 13:33.856
Just put it in a piece of brown bread.
I will eat it right now.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.233
Guys, the manager
said we are on strike two,

13:36.316 --> 13:38.068
so if you could bring it down
a little bit…

13:38.151 --> 13:40.654
So now you're going to defend
your best friend? Go ahead.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.197
Actually, Tanya, I was on your side.

13:42.281 --> 13:44.157
- What, seriously?
- Yes, Howard.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.952
You can't just go around
liking random girls' Instagram posts.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.788
It's disrespectful to your girlfriend,
and she has a right to be mad.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.957
Thank you. I like you.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.501
You're way hotter in person, by the way.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.587
Thank you so much.
I get that a lot, actually.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.298
Two dimensions are just not enough
for the cheekbones to really pop.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.591
If I can say in my defense--

14:00.674 --> 14:03.927
No. What you need to say, Howard,
is you're sorry to Tanya.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.180
Okay? And then we can all just move on

14:06.263 --> 14:08.348
and get back
to our very salty, salty meal.

14:10.893 --> 14:11.894
I'm sorry.

14:12.853 --> 14:16.523
I shouldn't have hurt your feelings,
and I love you.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.568
You know you're my ride or die.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.946
Okay. Apology accepted.

14:24.239 --> 14:27.868
Now cut up my calamari.
You know I don't like to chew too much.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.036
I know, baby.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.996
- Little pieces.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.122
Baby pieces.

14:38.754 --> 14:42.132
I found the one I was looking for.
A very special bottle.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.177
Thank God,
because these other ones were terrible.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.096
I am not trying to get us drunk.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.266
I'm just very proud of my wine,
that's all.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.228
I'll be careful.
I don't do hangovers anymore.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.230
My body just can't handle it.

14:56.313 --> 14:59.942
- So true. It's not easy to get older, huh?
- It isn't.

15:00.025 --> 15:03.445
I mean, I think I've noticed lately
that my peripheral vision is going.

15:03.529 --> 15:06.156
Like, right now, I can't see that.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.201
What if that was a car?
What if that was a toddler on a bike?

15:10.285 --> 15:12.287
What if it was two toddlers on two bikes?

15:12.371 --> 15:13.372
I'd be screwed.

15:14.706 --> 15:18.961
It is a tragedy of human life
to only appreciate youth when it's gone.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.382
Wow. You just got super French.

15:23.465 --> 15:28.887
I know, I know. I got that all the time.
Even in France, I'm very French.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.437
What is it? Do I have wine teeth?

15:38.188 --> 15:42.734
I'm just thinking.
You are different from other women I know.

15:43.694 --> 15:46.071
You are fuller.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.031
Yikes.

15:48.115 --> 15:51.660
No, no, no. It's a good thing.
There is more of you.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.079
I get it.
I'm still going to have dessert, though.

15:55.289 --> 15:57.624
What I'm trying to say, Molly, is…

15:58.917 --> 16:00.127
you are everything.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.802
- Here, your shawl--
- Leave it. I want it off.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.723
I love the feeling of the air.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.392
- And the company.
- Thank you.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.396
- Jean-Pierre!
- Jacqueline!

16:21.356 --> 16:22.482
<i>Comment ça va?</i>

16:27.905 --> 16:28.906
Jacqueline.

16:29.740 --> 16:30.741
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:33.327 --> 16:34.870
What's happening?

16:40.292 --> 16:43.754
You know what I want to come back?
Low-rise capri pants.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.757
Oh, my God! Thank you.
My calves are, like, my best feature.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.800
- Set them free.
- Why did I get a hip tattoo

16:48.884 --> 16:50.844
of the Tasmanian Devil
if I can't show it off?

16:52.387 --> 16:53.805
Cheers.

16:53.889 --> 16:56.725
Could I get a sip
of someone's Brownie Blaster martini?

16:56.808 --> 17:00.062
No. None for you, honey.
That's your punishment.

17:00.145 --> 17:03.607
You're right, baby.
I should go to the bathroom anyways.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.363
Howard's so great.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.865
Impossible to hate, and I have tried.

17:11.949 --> 17:14.826
Yeah, he's all right. He does his best.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.663
I can't believe you guys
have been together for eight years.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.414
That is insane.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.916
Yeah, it's been a very, very long time.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.377
Yeah, but he loves you so much.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.505
I'm sure that next step
is right around the corner.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.633
What? "Next step"?

17:30.467 --> 17:33.345
Like a proposal?
Did he say something to you?

17:33.428 --> 17:35.973
No, but would it be so bad if he did?

17:36.056 --> 17:38.684
Yes. I'm not marrying Howard.

17:38.767 --> 17:43.355
We have fun,
but Howard is not husband material.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.358
Then why have you been with him
for eight years?

17:46.441 --> 17:49.111
What I'm gonna do,
take a Uber to the airport? Hell no.

17:49.194 --> 17:52.489
Have you talked to Howard
about this? Does he know this--

17:52.573 --> 17:56.326
Baby, I met some Japanese tourists
who didn't want their brown bread.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.120
There's enough for everybody.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.748
Well, thank you, honey. You're the best.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.918
You can have one sip
from my Brownie Blaster martini.

18:05.544 --> 18:06.545
Yes.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.007
Chocolate and thick.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.925
Just like we like it.

18:12.634 --> 18:15.846
- Girl! Come here.
- I love you. You're so sweet.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.223
You can stay or go,
but this is happening.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.893
- He can stay.
- You like it when people watch.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.853
- I like a audience.
- Yes, you do.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.313
Yes!

18:24.396 --> 18:28.442
So, how are the two of you connected?

18:29.067 --> 18:30.694
Jacqueline is my partner.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.446
Your partner?

18:32.529 --> 18:33.697
Okay, that's…

18:34.990 --> 18:37.409
that's a very versatile word in English.

18:37.492 --> 18:41.330
So, are you saying "partner,"
like, "Howdy, partner!" or…

18:42.122 --> 18:44.958
She's so funny, Jean-Pierre.
She's like comedian American, no?

18:45.042 --> 18:48.295
She reminds me of Fran Drescher.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.756
- Fran Drescher. In <i>The Nanny.</i>
- Yeah.

18:50.839 --> 18:53.550
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah. Excuse me.

18:53.634 --> 18:56.053
I have to take him for one moment.
It's very important.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.262
I'll be right back.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.515
No problem.
You guys do whatever you need to do.

18:59.598 --> 19:04.061
Well, not whatever, but I just mean,
like, the stuff you have to do.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.313
And I'll be right here.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.116
Hey, is everything okay?

19:18.200 --> 19:20.619
No. There is a hot French lady here.

19:20.702 --> 19:21.703
<i>And she took him</i>.

19:21.787 --> 19:23.372
What? I'm calling the police.

19:23.455 --> 19:25.332
No, no.
I need you to do your Internet magic.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.875
Look up a woman named Jacqueline,

19:26.959 --> 19:29.670
<i>and find out exactly
what her relationship is to Jean-Pierre.</i>

19:29.753 --> 19:33.924
I need to know if they're together
or just French. Help me.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.342
Okay, I'm pulling it up now.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.140
And got it.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.643
Holy shit. Jacqueline is beautiful.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.855
It looks like she and Jean-Pierre
go to a lot of events together.

19:47.938 --> 19:49.398
<i>All the way back until 2012.</i>

19:51.233 --> 19:52.484
-<i>And there it is.</i>
- What?

19:52.568 --> 19:55.362
They're at her wedding.
She's married to a Tom Ford model.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.406
She and Jean-Pierre
are just working together.

19:57.489 --> 20:00.117
Really? Yes! Okay, anything else?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.952
Jacqueline's husband is something else.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.454
Look, usually I don't deal
with white boys as a rule…

20:05.163 --> 20:07.332
but for him, I would just, well--

20:07.416 --> 20:09.751
I gotta go. Okay.
Thank you so much, Sofia.

20:09.835 --> 20:12.212
I knew it! I knew
there was something happening between us.

20:15.841 --> 20:18.135
Now shall we discuss business?

20:19.678 --> 20:21.555
I think we should get to our proposal.

20:22.681 --> 20:23.849
- Proposal?
- Yeah.

20:23.932 --> 20:27.144
I'm very excited to collaborate,
and Jacqueline has a lot of ideas too.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.856
After all, that's why we bring you here.

20:33.525 --> 20:34.526
- Hey?
- Page 22.

20:34.610 --> 20:35.611
Okay.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.031
Fun.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.912
- Hi.
- Hi, Arthur.

20:47.873 --> 20:49.249
Did you need something?

20:49.333 --> 20:51.418
No. Do you need something?

20:51.502 --> 20:53.587
No, I was just checking in.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.592
Was that Molly
that you were talking to earlier?

20:58.675 --> 21:00.302
I couldn't help but overhear.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.596
Yeah. She just asked a question
about Jean-Pierre.

21:03.555 --> 21:05.641
Okay, so she's still with him?

21:06.725 --> 21:07.726
Sounds like it.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.312
Well, that's-- Yeah, good.

21:10.395 --> 21:13.148
I'm glad she's having fun, you know.
She deserves it.

21:15.901 --> 21:16.902
Okay.

21:30.040 --> 21:33.502
You really saved me tonight.
Thank you so much.

21:36.672 --> 21:38.465
That's our friendship leveling up.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.969
No problem.
It was quite an evening.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.431
Hey, listen, man.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.059
- I gotta tell you something.
- Yeah.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.353
Tanya kind of told me

21:51.436 --> 21:54.147
that she doesn't think
you're husband material.

21:55.607 --> 21:56.608
What?

21:56.692 --> 21:59.111
I know. She told me
when you got up to go to the bathroom,

21:59.194 --> 22:00.988
and I wasn't even gonna say anything,

22:01.071 --> 22:03.866
but then, you know,
as a friend, I realized

22:03.949 --> 22:06.577
you should know that she's just using you
until something better comes along.

22:07.953 --> 22:09.121
I can't believe it.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.164
I'm really sorry.

22:12.291 --> 22:14.877
I can't believe
you would lie to me like this!

22:14.960 --> 22:17.462
What? I'm not lying to you.

22:17.546 --> 22:19.089
I have zero to gain from making that up.

22:19.173 --> 22:21.967
- Tanya, did you say any of that stuff?
-<i>Hell no. He's lying.</i>

22:22.050 --> 22:23.260
Oh, my God.

22:23.343 --> 22:26.221
<i>He's jealous 'cause he ain't got nobody.
He's trying to take you away from me.</i>

22:26.847 --> 22:28.682
You <i>Single White Female-</i>ing me right now?

22:28.765 --> 22:31.435
No! What?
Have you seen that movie?

22:31.518 --> 22:35.147
Yes, I have. But here's a movie
I haven't seen. <i>Get Out</i>!

22:35.230 --> 22:37.024
Fine. You know what? I'm leaving.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.569
Have you seriously not seen <i>Get Out</i>?

22:40.652 --> 22:42.321
We're not friends anymore.

22:56.126 --> 22:58.295
So, I'll send you
the research we've been doing.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.379
Great.

23:00.464 --> 23:02.633
Let's have a conference call
about it next week.

23:03.217 --> 23:04.384
A conference call.

23:05.677 --> 23:09.932
That sounds great.
I can't wait to be dialed in.

23:10.015 --> 23:12.059
Okay, great. Have a good night.

23:14.144 --> 23:15.187
Have a good night.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.141
Ms. Wells?

23:54.476 --> 23:56.812
There's a man on a horse chasing us.

24:00.774 --> 24:02.568
Molly, stop! Stop the car!

24:02.651 --> 24:03.902
It's Jean-Pierre. Pull over!

24:16.206 --> 24:18.625
I'm sorry if my behavior was confusing,

24:18.709 --> 24:21.503
but I didn't know if this was
kind of romantic or just business.

24:21.587 --> 24:23.630
Oh, my God. Yeah, I didn't know either.

24:23.714 --> 24:26.800
I wanted to keep this professional because
I think we can do great work together,

24:26.884 --> 24:28.969
but there is this connection
between us, right?

24:29.052 --> 24:30.429
- Yes.
- Do you feel it too?

24:30.512 --> 24:34.224
Yes! I am so glad we talked about this
because it was so confusing.

24:34.308 --> 24:35.392
And I just want to say

24:35.475 --> 24:39.771
that the word "partner"
is really just so confusing. I've--
