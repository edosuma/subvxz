WE ALL READ IN HIGH SCHOOL,

02:44.798 --> 02:47.698

02:47.735 --> 02:49.695

02:49.737 --> 02:51.837
ALL THEY COULD SEE WERE
SHADOWS ON A WALL,

SO AFTER A WHILE, THEY STARTED
THINKING THAT WAS REALITY.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.609

02:59.247 --> 03:00.547

03:00.581 --> 03:02.281
HE'S FORGOTTEN
THAT ALL THOSE PERFECT BODIES

03:02.316 --> 03:04.686
AND PERFECT FACES
AREN'T REAL.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.788
THAT NO ONE'S REALLY THERE.
THAT THEY'RE ONLY...

03:07.821 --> 03:10.291

BETWEEN OUR BEER AND THEIR BEER

I'D GO TO BED
WITH HIM ANYWAY.

I WAS WONDERING IF--
WELL, YOU KNOW THOSE BOXES

11:45.973 --> 11:47.473
YOU WANTED ME TO MOVE?
- MM-HMM.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.777
- I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO SEEM
LIKE I'M SHIRKING OR ANYTHING,

11:49.810 --> 11:50.980
BUT THEY'RE KIND OF HEAVY.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.181
DO YOU THINK ONE OF THE GUYS
COULD MAYBE GIVE ME A HAND?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.384
- YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
I CAN GET SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.886
- OH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.888
OKAY.
I'LL BE OVER ON AISLE 14.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.060
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.959
- YES, YOUR MAJESTY.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.231
SOMEBODY SHOULD TELL HER
PRINCESS DI IS DEAD,

12:06.259 --> 12:08.359
AND THEY'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR A REPLACEMENT.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.855
- THE BOXES ARE HEAVY.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.297
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH ASKING FOR HELP.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.302
I--YOU KNOW, I THINK
SHE'S KIND OF SWEET ACTUALLY.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.374
- YOU THINK SHE'S SWEET?

12:16.403 --> 12:19.373
- WELL, I DON'T REALLY KNOW HER,
BUT, YEAH.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.376
- WHAT ABOUT CUTE?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.379
- YEAH, SHE'S CUTE.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.451
- WELL, SHE THINKS
YOU'RE CUTE TOO.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.219
- SHE...DOES?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.519
- SHE LIKES YOU A LOT.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.850
BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU LIKED HER,

12:32.886 --> 12:34.516
SO I SAID I'D FIND OUT.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.994
- SO YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
SHE'S STUCK-UP.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.464
- OH, SHE'S A DOLL.

12:38.491 --> 12:42.531
YOU KNOW, I NEVER HEARD YOU SAY
YOU LIKED A GIRL BEFORE.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.802
- WELL, I--
- IN FACT...

12:44.832 --> 12:48.802
I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT GIRLS.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.196
YOU...LIKE GIRLS,
DON'T YOU?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.168
- SURE.
UH...

12:53.206 --> 12:56.236
- SO THEN YOU'LL COME WITH US
AFTER WORK TONIGHT.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.406
WE'RE TAKING HER OUT
FOR A DRINK.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.914
- I DON'T THINK I CAN.
I--

12:58.946 --> 13:02.516
- AH! NO EXCUSES.
SHOELESS JOE'S, 7:30.

13:02.549 --> 13:07.419
AND DO SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR HAIR.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.894
- IT WAS A TRAP.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.832
- HEY, SEE THAT NUMBER
IN THE RED SHORTS?

13:11.859 --> 13:14.389
- I COULD WORK OUT
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS

13:14.427 --> 13:16.097
AND NEVER LOOK LIKE THAT.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.559
- PRETENDING SHE DIDN'T
LIKE HER,

13:17.597 --> 13:19.227
JUST TO SEE WHAT I'D SAY.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.596
- SHAWN PETERS.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.903
WENT HOME WITH HIM
THE OTHER NIGHT,

13:21.935 --> 13:23.295
THINKING HE WAS
THIS BRUTAL TOP.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.266
- AND?
- AND I FELL FOR IT.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.465
- TURNS OUT HE'S A BIG,
NELLY BOTTOM.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.477
[laughter]

13:28.508 --> 13:30.478
- I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.450
- AW, IT'S SO DISCOURAGING.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.909
ARE THERE NO REAL MEN LEFT?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.477
- AND NOW THEY'RE EXPECTING ME
TO MEET THEM.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.475
- STEROID CITY?
- NO, IN THIS STRAIGHT BAR.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.217
IS THERE ANYONE HERE
LISTENING?

13:40.253 --> 13:42.323
- THERE'S THIS NEW GIRL AT WORK
WHO'S INTERESTED IN YOU.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.185
FAT MARLEY TRICKED YOU
INTO MEETING HER

13:44.224 --> 13:45.894
AND SOME OF THE OTHERS
FOR A DRINK AFTER WORK,

13:45.926 --> 13:48.096
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO GO,
OR THEY MIGHT SUSPECT.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.298
CHECK OUT MR. PEC-DECK.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.529
SO WHAT...
IF THEY DO?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.104
- THEY COULD FIRE HIM.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.333
- OR I COULD END UP
AN ASSISTANT MANAGER

13:54.367 --> 13:55.937
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

13:55.969 --> 13:59.239
- AND THE SOLUTION
IS TO PRETEND YOU LIKE PUSSY?

13:59.272 --> 14:02.142
- AH, LOOK, HE'S NOT LIKE YOU,
OKAY?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.035
- WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

14:04.077 --> 14:06.577
- MEANING HE'S NOT
AN OBVIOUSLY GAY MAN.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.183
- ARE YOU ACCUSING ME
OF BEING OBVIOUS?

14:09.216 --> 14:13.886
- IF THE FUCK-ME PUMP FITS.

14:13.921 --> 14:17.591
- WELL, I COULD BE A...
A R-REAL MAN, IF I WANTED TO.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.164
YOU KNOW,
JUST LOWER MY VOICE,

14:20.193 --> 14:22.903
STOP...GESTURING
WITH MY HANDS,

14:22.930 --> 14:26.100
MAKE SURE MY FACE
IS EXPRESSIONLESS.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.673
NEVER, NEVER USE WORDS LIKE...

14:27.700 --> 14:30.300
LIKE "FABULOUS" OR "DIVINE,"

14:30.337 --> 14:32.507
TALK ABOUT,
I DON'T KNOW,

14:32.539 --> 14:35.309
NAILING BITCHES AND RBIs.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.512
BUT I'D RATHER
MY FLAME BURN BRIGHT

14:37.544 --> 14:40.654
THAN BE SOME PUNY,
LITTLE PILOT LIGHT.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.420
- AND A FABULOUS FLAME
IT IS.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.419
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.550
BUT MICHAEL IS OUT THERE
IN THE STRAIGHT WORLD.

14:46.586 --> 14:50.256
BELIEVE ME,
IT ISN'T EASY.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.660
YOU DO
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.661
- [panting]

14:53.693 --> 14:55.263
I BETTER GO CHANGE.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.665
- FOR YOUR BIG DATE?

14:58.698 --> 15:00.368
OOH, HERE'S A SPORTS MAG.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.140
BETTER BONE UP.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.400
JUST IN CASE THE CONVERSATION
VEERS AWAY

15:04.437 --> 15:07.367
FROM LIZA'S WEIGHT PROBLEM.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.508
- JUSTIN, DID YOU HEAR ME?

15:12.545 --> 15:14.945
I SAID YOU'RE NOT GOING.
- I'M GOING.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.722
- YOU WERE JUST THERE
LAST NIGHT.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.719
- SO WHAT?

15:17.750 --> 15:21.250
- SO I WAS PLANNING TO TAKE YOU
AND YOUR SISTER

15:21.288 --> 15:23.358
OUT FOR PIZZA.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.660
YOU--
[sighs]

15:25.692 --> 15:28.102
YOU KNOW, I EXPECT YOU
TO CLEAN UP THIS MESS.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.398
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU HAVE TO SPEND

15:29.429 --> 15:32.469
ALL YOUR TIME WITH DAPHNE.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.329
OF ALL THE BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES

15:34.367 --> 15:35.367
YOUR FATHER AND I
BOUGHT FOR YOU,

15:35.402 --> 15:37.342
YOU HAVE TO PICK SOMETHING
THAT NO LONGER FITS.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.370
THAT IS TOO TIGHT.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.437
- THAT'S WHY.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.046
- JUSTIN?

15:46.079 --> 15:48.349
DON'T I GET
A KISS GOOD-BYE?

15:56.489 --> 15:59.359
I EXPECT YOU TO CALL!

16:01.128 --> 16:03.458
[door opens]

16:03.496 --> 16:06.166
[door closes]

16:16.243 --> 16:19.213
- WE NEED A SECRET CODE WORD
LIKE "SHAZAM,"

16:19.246 --> 16:20.646
SO THAT IF I GET
IN A TIGHT SPOT,

16:20.680 --> 16:22.450
YOU CAN COME IN
AND RESCUE ME.

16:22.482 --> 16:27.422
- A TIGHT SPOT.
HOW ABOUT "BUTT PLUG"?

16:27.454 --> 16:28.564
- "BUTT PLUG" MIGHT BE
A LITTLE HARD

16:28.588 --> 16:30.188
TO WORK INTO A CONVERSATION.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.193
- BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU ARE,

16:31.224 --> 16:33.234
PRETENDING YOU'RE ONE
OF THEM.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.490
- I COULDN'T HELP IT.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.557
- NO, YOU COULD HAVE
TOLD HER THE TRUTH,

16:35.595 --> 16:38.695
INSTEAD OF ACTING
LIKE A SCARED, LITTLE FAGGOT.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.471
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID, "I
TAKE IT UP THE ASS, SWEETHEART.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.501
DEAL WITH IT."
- RIGHT. RIGHT.

16:43.536 --> 16:48.106
BY THE WAY, I NOTICED YOU GOT
THE JEEP REPAINTED.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.741
[laughter]
- GREAT GAME.

16:50.777 --> 16:54.577
[overlapping chatter]

16:54.614 --> 16:59.354
- GOD, THIS PLACE
IS LIKE BREEDERS' CENTRAL.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.686
BUTT PLUG, BUTT PLUG,
BUTT PLUG,

17:00.720 --> 17:04.819
BUTT--

17:04.857 --> 17:07.727
- SEE YOU, MIKEY.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.131
- I WANNA WATCH THE END
OF THE GAME.

17:13.165 --> 17:17.536
- * EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE *

17:17.569 --> 17:20.270
* LITTLE DARLIN'

17:20.307 --> 17:24.377
* LITTLE DARLIN' MINE

17:24.411 --> 17:26.810
* A DAY
OR A LIFETIME *

17:26.846 --> 17:30.816
* IT DON'T MATTER
TO ME *

17:30.850 --> 17:32.520
* AS LONG AS YOU
ARE BY MY SIDE *

17:32.552 --> 17:34.492
- MICHAEL.
MICHAEL!

17:34.521 --> 17:36.721
WHERE YOU BEEN?
WE THOUGHT YOU GOT LOST.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.726
- SOME, UH,
LAST-MINUTE BUSINESS.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.288
- WELL, SLIDE IT ON IN.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.827
HARV...
MOVE YOUR HAIRY ASS.

17:42.862 --> 17:46.702
- [chuckles]

17:46.733 --> 17:51.173
- THANKS.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.344
- WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?
- UH...

17:53.373 --> 17:54.443
SAME AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.114
- GOOD CHOICE.

17:56.143 --> 17:57.583
UH, BRING OVER
ANOTHER PITCHER.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.650
- HI.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.719
- HI.
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.179
- I TOLD YOU HE'D BE HERE,
DIDN'T I?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.787
NOT TO WORRY?

18:05.818 --> 18:07.418
- I WASN'T WORRIED.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.194
- NOW JUST MAKE SURE
HE'S NOT SEEING ANYONE,

18:09.222 --> 18:11.392
BEFORE YOU GET ALL LOVEY-DOVEY.
[giggles]

18:11.424 --> 18:13.734
- MARLEY, WOULD YOU SHUT UP
AND LEAVE 'EM ALONE?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.760
- [mouths silently]

18:15.795 --> 18:17.725
- YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANYONE,
ARE YOU?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.474
- ME?

18:20.500 --> 18:23.300
NO.
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

18:23.336 --> 18:26.506
I MEAN--
- I UNDERSTAND.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.379
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED
WITH SOMEONE

18:28.408 --> 18:32.878
IF THEY'RE INVOLVED ALREADY.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.482
SO ARE YOU?
- SEEING ANYONE?

18:35.515 --> 18:36.775
NO, WE JUST BROKE UP.

18:36.816 --> 18:40.216
- OH. SORRY.
- OH, DON'T BE.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.763
HE WAS A REAL DOOFUS.
- [chuckles]

18:42.789 --> 18:44.759
- ONLY I DIDN'T KNOW IT
AT THE TIME.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.891
THERE'S SO MUCH YOU DON'T KNOW
AT THE TIME.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.326
- ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.932
- LIKE, CAN YOU BELIEVE, HE...

18:50.963 --> 18:52.833
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO FIX A SINK?

18:52.865 --> 18:55.165
[laughter]
- REALLY!

18:55.202 --> 18:57.172
- HE CALLED ME AT WORK SAYING,
"WHAT SHOULD I DO?"

18:57.204 --> 18:59.644
I SAID,
"I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.812
"BUY SOME CEMENT.
GET A CORK.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.311
USE CHEWING GUM.
BUT PLUG IT UP!"

19:04.344 --> 19:07.314
[laughter]

19:07.347 --> 19:11.917
- "BUT PLUG."
[chuckles]

19:11.951 --> 19:16.561
BUTT PLUG?
[laughs]

19:17.957 --> 19:19.387
- A MILLION DOLLARS?

19:19.426 --> 19:20.526
- THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.790
- A MILLION
FUCKING DOLLARS?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.898
- BRIAN, PLEASE.
YOU'LL WAKE THE BABY.

19:23.930 --> 19:27.970
- WELL, THE ANSWER'S NO.
DEFINITELY NOT.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.800
- [scoffs] I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE PROBLEM.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.336
I MEAN, LINDSAY TOLD ME YOU
OFFERED TO HELP SUPPORT HIM.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.972
- IT WAS VERY GENEROUS.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.476
- WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT
THAN A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.409
- IT'S SIMPLY IN CASE
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.506
- LIKE I'M DECAPITATED
AT A RAILROAD CROSSING?

19:41.548 --> 19:44.378
OR BURNED BEYOND RECOGNITION
IN SOME GAS EXPLOSION?

19:44.417 --> 19:47.517
YOU KNOW, I CAN JUST IMAGINE
THE GRIZZLY DEATHS

19:47.554 --> 19:48.524
YOU'VE CONJURED UP FOR ME.

19:48.555 --> 19:52.525
- LIKE IN CASE
YOU GET SICK.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.300
- AH.
EVEN BETTER.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.829
- CONSIDERING YOUR LIFE.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.574
I MEAN, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE TESTED?

19:59.599 --> 20:02.439
- SIX MONTHS AGO.
I WAS NEGATIVE.

20:02.469 --> 20:06.569
- THAT'S 26 WEEKS
AND 182 ONE-NIGHT STANDS.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.766
- YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED PEOPLE

20:07.807 --> 20:09.307
WHO COULD MULTIPLY
IN THEIR HEADS.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.842
AND I'M ALWAYS CAREFUL.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.478
- LOOK, THIS ISN'T FOR US.
IT'S FOR OUR SON.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.624
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE
HE'LL BE PROVIDED FOR.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.979
- AND ALL I HAVE
TO DO IS DIE.

20:18.017 --> 20:23.387
- HOPEFULLY NOT BEFORE YOU SIGN
THESE PAPERS.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.863
[laughter]

20:25.892 --> 20:27.532
- WE WON'T BE LAUGHING
COME SUPER BOWL TIME,

20:27.560 --> 20:28.830
WHEN WE'RE UP
AGAINST THE TITANS.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.361
- WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE.
- DON'T SAY THAT.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.798
- YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE.
RIGHT, MIKE?

20:32.832 --> 20:37.602
- LIKE CHER!

20:37.637 --> 20:40.667
- YOU WATCH FOOTBALL?

20:40.707 --> 20:42.677
- CONSTANTLY.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.739
- [chuckles]
SO, UH...

20:44.777 --> 20:48.917
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:48.948 --> 20:53.388
- WHAT DO I THINK?

20:53.420 --> 20:56.820
I THINK...

20:56.856 --> 20:58.826
DUE TO FREE AGENCY, WE'VE LOST
SOME OF OUR BEST PLAYERS.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.758
STILL, OUR DEFENSE IS STRONG,
BUT WE NEED A NEW SCHEME

21:00.793 --> 21:04.603
FROM OUR OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR
TO MOVE THE BALL.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.666
- [chuckles]
THAT'S JUST WHAT I SAY.

21:09.702 --> 21:13.642
[laughter]

21:13.673 --> 21:18.413
[cell phone rings]

21:18.445 --> 21:20.475

HELLO, SPORTS FANS.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.953
- I'M COMING TO GET YOU.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.381
- IT'S OKAY.
I'M HAVING A REALLY GOOD TIME.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.847
SHE'S REALLY, REALLY NICE.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.515
- SHE'S REALLY NICE?

21:28.555 --> 21:30.085
DO YOU THINK SHE AND HER FRIENDS
WOULD BE REALLY NICE

21:30.122 --> 21:32.492
IF THEY KNEW THE LITTLE CHARADE
YOU WERE PLAYING?

21:32.525 --> 21:33.825
THEY'D PROBABLY TIE YOU
TO A FENCE

21:33.860 --> 21:36.060
AND BASH YOUR BRAINS IN.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.655
- THEY'RE NOT LIKE THAT.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.067
- NOT LIKE THAT, HUH?

21:39.098 --> 21:40.798
LISTEN TO ME, MIKEY.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.103
ARE YOU LISTENING?
- YEAH, I'M LISTENING.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.835
- THERE'S ONLY TWO KINDS

21:44.871 --> 21:46.741
OF STRAIGHT PEOPLE
IN THIS WORLD--

21:46.773 --> 21:48.813
THE ONES THAT HATE YOU
TO YOUR FACE,

21:48.841 --> 21:51.711
AND THE ONES THAT HATE YOU
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.954
NOW GET THE FUCK
OUT OF THERE...

21:54.981 --> 21:57.921
BECAUSE I NEED YOU.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.350
- * AND I NEED YOUR BODY

22:00.387 --> 22:01.887
* LET ME HAVE YOUR BODY

22:01.921 --> 22:03.121
* OH, I NEED YOUR BODY

22:03.155 --> 22:05.625
- * HOW I WAS GONNA CHANGE,
BUT I'M NOT *

22:05.658 --> 22:07.458
* IF YOU KEEP DOING THINGS
I DON'T *

22:07.494 --> 22:09.104
* YOU BETTER THINK
all: * THINK

22:09.128 --> 22:11.858
- * THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO TO ME, YEAH *

22:11.898 --> 22:13.828
* THINK
all: * THINK

22:13.866 --> 22:15.696
- * LET YOUR MIND GO,
LET YOURSELF BE FREE *

22:15.735 --> 22:16.995
- * OH, YEAH

22:17.036 --> 22:21.606
- * YEAH-AH-AH

22:21.641 --> 22:23.841
*

22:23.876 --> 22:25.406
- HI.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.045
- OH, SHIT,
JUST WHAT I NEED.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.719
WHAT'S HIS NAME.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.848
- JUSTIN.
HIS NAME'S JUSTIN.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.723
IF I CAN REMEMBER IT
AND I DIDN'T EVEN FUCK HIM,

22:32.752 --> 22:34.152
WHY CAN'T YOU?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.816
- BECAUSE I DID.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.160
SO, DAWSON, HOW ARE THINGS DOWN
AT THE CREEK?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.465
[crowd cheering]

22:45.498 --> 22:48.128
- THANK YOU, PITTSBURGH.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.597
I LOVE YOU.

22:50.637 --> 22:53.907
[cheers and applause]

22:53.940 --> 22:55.070
YOU KNOW,
FOR A SKINNY WHITE BOY,

22:55.107 --> 22:57.607
I MAKE ONE FUCKING FABULOUS
BLACK WOMAN.

22:57.644 --> 22:58.954
- [chuckles]

22:58.978 --> 23:00.808
HOW ABOUT ANOTHER ROUND
ON ME?

23:00.847 --> 23:03.677
- I GOT A BETTER IDEA.
LET'S MOVE ON.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.016
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH HERE?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.551
- I'VE HAD EVERYONE HERE.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.416
- OH, YEAH,
MY PROBLEM PRECISELY.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.585
- YOU HAVEN'T HAD ME.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.893
- OH, YEAH?

23:12.925 --> 23:14.955
- WHAT?
Y-YOU NEVER TOLD US.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.664
- THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.897
- WE WERE UP IN HIS ROOM.

23:19.932 --> 23:23.442
WE WERE 14, 15 TOPS.
- [sighs]

23:23.470 --> 23:24.900
- WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
STUDYING, WHATEVER,

23:24.937 --> 23:26.637
ONLY WE'RE NOT.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.173
WE'RE LOOKING
AT THIS TRASHY PHOTO MAG

23:28.207 --> 23:29.737
HIS MOM SWIPED
FROM THE BEAUTY PARLOR.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.636
ANYWAY...

23:31.678 --> 23:33.678
THERE'S THIS SHOT
OF PATRICK SWAYZE

23:33.713 --> 23:36.083
FROM DIRTY DANCING...

23:36.115 --> 23:37.175
WITHOUT HIS SHIRT ON.

23:37.216 --> 23:38.686
- [sighs]
- [chuckles]

23:38.718 --> 23:40.848
- SO I GOT THIS HARD-ON
JUST FROM LOOKING AT IT,

23:40.887 --> 23:43.957
AND I GLANCE OVER AT MIKEY,
AND GUESS WHAT.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.930
HE'S GOT ONE TOO.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.158
- OKAY, YOU CAN STOP NOW.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.234
- TWIN STIFFIES.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.032
I REACH OVER,
START RUBBING IT.

23:53.065 --> 23:56.635
HE'S PRACTICALLY SWOONING.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.769
I POP IT OUT,
START STROKING IT,

23:59.806 --> 24:02.536
NICE AND SLOW.

24:02.575 --> 24:05.675
AND WE'RE BOTH
THIS CLOSE.

24:05.712 --> 24:08.552
THEN...

24:08.581 --> 24:10.721
HIS MOM WALKS IN
WITHOUT KNOCKING.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.150
[laughter]

24:12.184 --> 24:14.954
- THEY ALWAYS DO.
DID SHE SEE YOU?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.557
- I DON'T SEE
HOW SHE COULD HAVE MISSED IT.

24:16.589 --> 24:20.159
- ONLY WE DIDN'T COME,
SO IT DOESN'T COUNT.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.832
- OH, DIRTY DANCING.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.702
THAT'S A REALLY OLD MOVIE.
- WHAT?

24:25.732 --> 24:27.732
- I SAID
THAT'S A REALLY OLD MOVIE.

24:27.767 --> 24:28.997
- IT'S NOT THAT OLD.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.735
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?

24:30.770 --> 24:33.840
- UH-OH.

24:33.873 --> 24:38.043
- HOW OLD
DO YOU THINK I AM?

24:38.077 --> 24:39.747
- 33?
[laughter]

24:39.779 --> 24:42.549
- FUCK...YOU.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.522
- HE'S 29.
- AND FUCK YOU TOO.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.251
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM FOR?
- FAIR'S FAIR.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.515
- WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
IN A FEW MONTHS,

24:48.555 --> 24:49.755
YOU'LL BE 30.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.219
MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD.

24:51.257 --> 24:54.127
- HMM, WELL...

24:54.160 --> 24:55.860
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.225
YOU ALREADY ARE.

24:57.263 --> 25:00.603
- OH, HO, HO, HO.

25:00.633 --> 25:04.203
- OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
COME BACK HERE.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.566
YOU'RE NOT STICKING US
WITH THAT KID.

25:06.606 --> 25:09.006
HE'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
NOW GET BACK IN THERE.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.741
- YOU KNOW,
I'M GETTING A LITTLE SICK

25:10.777 --> 25:13.147
OF PEOPLE TELLING ME
WHAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.979
IF LINDSAY AND MELANIE WANT
TO GO OFF AND HAVE A KID,

25:15.014 --> 25:16.624
THAT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.

25:16.649 --> 25:19.049
IF WHAT'S HIS NAME, JUSTIN,
WANTS TO GO OUT

25:19.085 --> 25:20.685
AND PICK UP GUYS
WHILE HE'S STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL,

25:20.720 --> 25:21.790
THAT'S HIS RESPONSIBILITY.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.761
MY RESPONSIBILITY
IS TO MYSELF.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.091
I DON'T OWE ANYBODY
A GODDAMN THING.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.695
- CALM DOWN.

25:35.902 --> 25:39.812
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.778
- AND WHERE DO PEOPLE
GET OFF THINKING

25:43.810 --> 25:47.280
I'M NOT A KIND PERSON?

25:47.313 --> 25:49.223
- WHO SAID THAT?

25:49.248 --> 25:53.748
- TED, FOR EXAMPLE,
THINKS I'M A HEARTLESS SHIT.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.016
- IT'S YOUR APPEAL.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.915
PLUS, HE'S JUST JEALOUS

25:57.957 --> 26:00.887
AND LONELY AND...

26:03.262 --> 26:06.132
- I HAPPEN TO BE VERY KIND.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.735
VERY LOVING.

26:13.205 --> 26:16.105
HEY, ZACK,
HOW'S IT GOING?

26:16.142 --> 26:17.742
- NOT BAD.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.007
- HOW'S PETER?

26:19.045 --> 26:24.075
- STILL DEAD.

26:24.116 --> 26:28.386
- OH, SHIT.
I FORGOT.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.820
- WELL, IF ANYONE
HAS ANY DOUBTS

26:29.856 --> 26:32.956
ABOUT HOW KIND AND LOVING
YOU ARE...

26:32.992 --> 26:36.232
THAT SHOULD CONVINCE THEM.

26:36.262 --> 26:41.802
[engine revs]

26:41.834 --> 26:43.874
- ANYONE UP FOR BABYLON?

26:43.903 --> 26:45.973
- I WAS THINKING BOYTOY.

26:46.005 --> 26:49.075
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN SNUBBED
BY A TWINKIE IN WEEKS.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.238
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

26:51.277 --> 26:52.947
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

26:52.979 --> 26:55.719
- WELL, WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE HIM HERE.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.748
- IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM.
- HE'S MINE?

26:57.784 --> 26:59.694
- NO, BRIAN'S YOUR PROBLEM.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.719
- LET HIM CLEAN UP HIS OWN MESS
FOR A CHANGE.

27:01.754 --> 27:05.194
- DON'T WASTE YOUR FRIDAY NIGHT
BABY-SITTING.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.003
[upbeat dance music]

27:15.034 --> 27:18.004
- * OH, YEAH YEAH YEAH

27:18.037 --> 27:19.407
*

27:19.438 --> 27:22.208
* UH-HUH, UH-HUH

27:22.241 --> 27:24.981
- I CAME ALL THE WAY HERE
JUST TO SEE HIM.

27:25.011 --> 27:27.111
HE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

27:27.146 --> 27:31.816
- YEAH, WELL, THE THING YOU
GOT TO KNOW ABOUT BRIAN IS...

27:31.851 --> 27:33.421
HE'S NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND.

27:33.452 --> 27:36.362
BRIAN DOESN'T DO BOYFRIENDS.

27:36.388 --> 27:39.688
- YEAH, WELL, YOU WEREN'T THERE
WHEN WE WERE DOING IT.

27:39.726 --> 27:42.386
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE THINGS WE DID,

27:42.428 --> 27:45.298
HOW HE KISSED ME.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.471
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.199
- I KNOW THIS.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.965
BRIAN IS A SELFISH PRICK

27:51.003 --> 27:53.043
WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE
BUT HIMSELF.

27:53.072 --> 27:58.082
AND IF I WERE YOU,
I'D JUST FORGET ABOUT HIM.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.780
- HIYA, BOYS.
GETTIN' ANY TONIGHT?

28:00.813 --> 28:02.183
[chuckles]

28:02.214 --> 28:03.484
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
AROUND HERE BEFORE.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.045
- HE'S NEW.
- AND CUTE.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.215
EVERY GUY IN THE PLACE HAS HIS
EYE ON YOU TONIGHT, SWEETHEART.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.494
- CAN WE ORDER?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.021
- SHOOT.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.317
BUT IT'LL BE
THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT,

28:12.358 --> 28:13.928
AM I RIGHT?
[chuckles]

28:13.960 --> 28:14.960
- HA-HA!

28:14.994 --> 28:16.804
I'LL HAVE
THE CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.729
NO REMARKS.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.465
AND, UH, HE'LL HAVE
A BACON CHEESEBURGER.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.869
- "PLEASE."
- PLEASE.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.902
- YOU GOTTA KEEP
YOUR STRENGTH UP, SUNSHINE.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.807
YOU CAN'T CRUISE ALL NIGHT
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

28:26.839 --> 28:30.179
[chuckles]

28:30.209 --> 28:34.009
- WHAT A FREAK!

28:34.046 --> 28:35.746
- YEAH, SHE TAKES
SOME GETTING USED TO,

28:35.782 --> 28:38.352
BUT ONCE YOU DO,
CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE HER.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.324
- ONE CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK
WITH NO REMARKS,

28:40.352 --> 28:41.792
COMING UP IN A FLASH.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.891
- THANKS, MOM.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.833
- YOU'RE WELCOME, BABY.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.159
- I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

28:48.194 --> 28:51.204
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.270
- [chuckles]

28:58.871 --> 29:01.971
YOU'RE, LIKE, SO LUCKY.
- I AM?

29:02.008 --> 29:04.138
- YOUR MOM'S COOL
ABOUT YOUR BEING GAY.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.046
IF MINE FOUND OUT,
SHE'D KILL ME.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.848
- AT LEAST IT GIVES HER
A SENSE OF PURPOSE.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.080
I MEAN, WITHOUT ME,
SHE'D BE PLAYING BINGO

29:09.115 --> 29:11.245
INSTEAD OF ORGANIZING
PRIDE MARCHES AND...

29:11.283 --> 29:12.993
HANDING OUT CONDOMS.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.049
DO YOU NEED A RIDE?

29:14.086 --> 29:15.986
- UH, I BORROWED
A FRIEND'S CAR.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.062
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
A LITTLE BEEMER OF YOUR OWN?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.990
- I'M WORKING ON IT.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.056
- JUST REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
ABOUT BRIAN.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.534
- IF HE'S
SUCH A SELFISH PRICK,

29:23.562 --> 29:25.462
HOW COME YOU'RE ALWAYS
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND?

29:25.497 --> 29:27.397
- I'M NOT ALWAYS
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.573
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.271
WE ACCEPT EACH OTHER
FOR WHO WE ARE,

29:31.303 --> 29:33.343
NO JUDGMENTS,
NO OBLIGATIONS,

29:33.372 --> 29:35.512
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

29:35.541 --> 29:38.481
- YOU'RE JUST WAITING FOR HIM
TO FINISH JERKING YOU OFF.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.280
- WHAT?
- YOU NEVER GOT OFF.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.523
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STILL HANGING
AROUND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

29:43.549 --> 29:48.149
- GO ON, CHICKEN.
BACK TO YOUR COOP.

29:48.187 --> 29:49.217
AND DON'T GO LOOKING
FOR HIM.

29:49.255 --> 29:53.355
IT'LL JUST
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.062
- READY, SWEETIE?

29:59.899 --> 30:03.499
DID HE TAKE OFF?

30:03.535 --> 30:05.235
JUST AS WELL.

30:05.271 --> 30:10.241
HE WAS A LITTLE TOO YOUNG
FOR YOU.

30:10.276 --> 30:14.046
[chuckles]

30:14.080 --> 30:17.020
- SHOULD I INVITE
MY COUSIN RITA?

30:17.049 --> 30:19.089
- WHICH ONE'S SHE?
- YOU KNOW.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.048
THE ONE
WITH THE, UH, OVERBITE

30:21.087 --> 30:22.187
WHO NEVER APPROVED OF US?

30:22.221 --> 30:23.961
- OH, HER.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.190
MIGHT AS WELL.
SHE PROBABLY WON'T COME ANYWAY.

30:26.225 --> 30:29.325
OH, THAT'S MY GOOD BOY.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.901
- YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.230
I USED TO SEE THESE WOMEN
FEEDING THEIR KIDS,

30:32.264 --> 30:34.334
AND I'D THINK,
"UGH, WHAT A TURN-OFF."

30:34.366 --> 30:37.596
BUT WATCHING YOU...

30:37.636 --> 30:40.236
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

30:40.272 --> 30:43.382
- YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW CONNECTED YOU FEEL.

30:43.409 --> 30:46.349
[baby coos]

30:55.087 --> 30:59.387
GOOD NIGHT, SWEETIE.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.185
NEXT TIME,
WE'LL FEED HIM TOGETHER.

31:02.228 --> 31:06.228
YOU CAN GIVE HIM
MY BREAST.
