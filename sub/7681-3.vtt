01:17.166 --> 01:18.656
I don't care what anybody says.

01:18.667 --> 01:20.658
Birthdays are important.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.658
So when a good friend's
turning 60,

01:23.166 --> 01:25.703
and I'm returning
from another government mission,

01:25.709 --> 01:28.155
there isn't a much faster way
to get home

01:28.166 --> 01:32.159
than to catch a ride
on a T-38 ace flight.

01:33.709 --> 01:35.700
It's a good thing
they didn't serve a meal

01:35.709 --> 01:37.165
on this flight,

01:37.166 --> 01:40.704
'cause my heart was
already in my mouth.

01:59.208 --> 02:02.200
It may not have been
first class seating,

02:02.208 --> 02:05.746
but who cares
with pilots like this?

02:19.208 --> 02:22.746
The Phoenix Foundation has
thrown some wild parties before,

02:22.750 --> 02:26.743
but this time, Pete really
decided to do it up right.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.741
Surprise!

02:29.750 --> 02:31.741
Happy birthday, Kelly!

02:31.750 --> 02:33.741
Oh...

02:33.750 --> 02:34.739
You're not Kelly!

02:34.750 --> 02:37.742
Nice to know I'm so appreciated.
Thank you.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.741
All right, everyone,
let's clean up the confetti

02:39.750 --> 02:41.240
and the streamers right away.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.740
And quickly.

02:42.750 --> 02:43.785
And turn that map light off.

02:43.792 --> 02:45.248
Kelly's going to be here
any second.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.787
Mac, it's good to see you,
but you're a day early.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.248
What are you doing here?

02:49.250 --> 02:51.241
Ah, it's for Kelly.
I wouldn't miss it.

02:51.792 --> 02:53.248
But to tell you the truth,
I'd show up anywhere

02:53.250 --> 02:54.786
to see you wearing that hat.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.786
So, how'd you con Kelly
into coming over?

02:59.250 --> 03:01.241
I lied... I told him
one of our computers was down

03:01.250 --> 03:02.786
and needed to be fixed
right away.

03:02.792 --> 03:05.784
You know, it's not like him
to be late.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.870
No answer at his place.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.866
Where'd that come from?

04:13.875 --> 04:15.331
Listen to this, Pete.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.869
"Dear Mac,
if anything will improve

04:16.875 --> 04:19.332
your game, this will. Kelly."

04:19.333 --> 04:21.324
Well, your game could stand
a little improving.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.324
Pete...

04:23.333 --> 04:25.870
you know that favorite pair
of hockey gloves I've got?

04:25.875 --> 04:27.365
The old beat-up ones? Yeah.

04:27.375 --> 04:28.865
Yeah, well,
I'd never give those away.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.366
This is Kelly's
favorite cue stick.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.866
Something's wrong.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.866
I'll wait here
in case he shows up.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.364
Kelly!

04:53.375 --> 04:55.366
Kelly, it's me, Mac!

04:56.375 --> 04:58.366
Open up!

04:59.917 --> 05:01.373
Kelly!

06:06.458 --> 06:07.994
Aw!

06:08.001 --> 06:09.457
Ugh!

06:25.001 --> 06:25.990
Come on!

06:26.500 --> 06:28.491
Come on!

06:43.500 --> 06:45.991
Happy birthday, Kelly.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.992
I just can't believe
you'd do something that dumb.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.491
What was going
through your head, Kelly?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.990
Let it go, Mac.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.490
No, I won't!

07:02.000 --> 07:03.991
I want to know
why a guy I know...

07:04.000 --> 07:06.537
a guy I thought I knew...
a man I respect,

07:06.542 --> 07:08.999
would try and take
his own life!

07:09.000 --> 07:10.991
Kelly, you've got three kids!

07:11.000 --> 07:11.989
Did you forget about them?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.536
I did it for them!

07:13.542 --> 07:16.534
I turned 60 years old today,

07:16.542 --> 07:17.998
and you know what I got
to show for it?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.991
Nothing! I'm broke.

07:20.542 --> 07:21.998
All those years of scrimping
and saving,

07:22.000 --> 07:22.989
I got nothing' left!

07:23.000 --> 07:24.536
Do you understand?

07:24.542 --> 07:27.534
How? You were always so careful
with your money.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.032
It's gone, Mac.

07:29.041 --> 07:32.533
It doesn't matter how.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.032
I got two kids in college

07:34.041 --> 07:36.032
and another one in grad school.

07:36.041 --> 07:39.033
What am I going to tell them?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.531
A man's not worth much

07:40.542 --> 07:45.036
if he can't help pay
his kids' education.

07:45.041 --> 07:49.034
That's what this idiot stunt
was all about? Pride?

07:49.041 --> 07:50.577
I figured with my insurance.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.574
I'm worth more dead than alive.

07:52.583 --> 07:56.030
Kelly, you could've come
to me or Pete.

07:56.041 --> 07:58.578
I don't like going to people
with my problems.

07:58.583 --> 08:00.574
You don't go to people
with your problems.

08:00.583 --> 08:01.572
You come to your friends.

08:01.583 --> 08:03.574
Well, you don't
always remember that.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.574
Yeah... I know.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.574
All right... how'd you lose it?

08:23.083 --> 08:24.619
I was cheated.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.081
Can you believe that?

08:27.083 --> 08:29.620
I got nothing left.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.616
He-he-he made it sound

08:31.625 --> 08:33.081
so enticing.

08:33.082 --> 08:36.075
Cheated how?

08:36.625 --> 08:39.616
I invested
in some land development.

08:39.625 --> 08:43.072
A swamp bottom,
it turned out to be.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.614
Give me a name, Kelly.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.616
Forget it, Mac.
This guy is dangerous.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.115
I found out
he killed some people.

08:51.625 --> 08:53.115
I want his name.

08:53.125 --> 08:55.116
James Crowe.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.615
I already had Research
check him out.

08:57.125 --> 08:59.616
He's a regular criminal
entrepreneur, this guy.

08:59.625 --> 09:03.117
Stick-up man in
his youth, a fence,

09:03.125 --> 09:04.114
a shakedown artist,

09:04.125 --> 09:06.662
even deals in cocaine
if the price is right.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.123
Ah, a busy guy.

09:08.125 --> 09:11.117
Yeah, but this latest
was a land fraud deal

09:11.125 --> 09:15.118
that took Kelly for 35,000,
along with seven others.

09:15.125 --> 09:18.117
Retirees... all of them.
$400,000 in all.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.114
What do the police say?

09:19.125 --> 09:20.114
They know he's a thief,

09:20.667 --> 09:22.123
but the fraud is
a technical fine line.

09:22.125 --> 09:25.162
The D.A. won't file charges,
so the police closed the file.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.155
Hi. Joanne Remmings.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.155
MacGyver.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.656
Oh, I've heard about you.

09:29.166 --> 09:30.656
You're the guy who does
the whatchamacallits,

09:30.667 --> 09:33.659
you know, MacGyverisms:
turns one thing into another?

09:33.667 --> 09:36.659
"MacGyverisms"?

09:36.667 --> 09:38.658
Joanne is new here.
She just signed on.

09:38.667 --> 09:39.656
In addition
to threat assessment

09:39.667 --> 09:40.656
and terrorist strategy,

09:40.667 --> 09:42.658
she just happens to have written

09:42.667 --> 09:43.656
a major research paper

09:44.166 --> 09:45.702
on bunko scams.

09:47.166 --> 09:49.157
Here it comes. James Crowe.

09:49.709 --> 09:51.700
Seven indictments.
Zero convictions.

09:51.709 --> 09:53.700
Every con in the book.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.702
A man of many talents.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.702
Yeah, he really gets around.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.157
Oh, I'd really like to
get this guy Crowe

10:00.166 --> 10:02.157
and hang him by his ears
for what he did to Kelly.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.702
That makes two of us.

10:03.709 --> 10:05.199
What else do you know
about this guy?

10:05.709 --> 10:08.200
Well, he can't stay away
from the track.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.699
Give Crowe a horse to bet on,
and he's in seventh heaven.

10:10.709 --> 10:12.199
Oh, and silk.

10:12.709 --> 10:13.198
He loves to wear

10:13.709 --> 10:14.698
white silk suits

10:14.709 --> 10:16.199
with a Panam a hat every day.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.698
Probably has a
closet full of them.

10:17.709 --> 10:20.200
Well, whatever he wears,
the D.A.'s Office doesn't figure

10:20.208 --> 10:21.698
they've got
a guaranteed conviction,

10:22.208 --> 10:23.197
so the police
have lost interest.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.199
Maybe it takes a con
to beat a con.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.741
I mean, I hate to toot
my own horn, guys,

10:27.750 --> 10:29.741
but I know some great stings.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.741
I'd love to help
you nail this guy.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.741
Nah, I don't think so.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.741
We could use
the Philadelphia Flash

10:35.750 --> 10:37.206
or the Toledo Twist.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.206
No, no, no.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.745
I kind of like this idea.

10:43.750 --> 10:47.242
Oh, Mac, I can't get
the Foundation involved

10:47.250 --> 10:48.239
in something like this.

10:48.250 --> 10:49.239
Absolutely not.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.740
That's why it'll be
just you and me.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.239
And me.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.241
Come on, Pete, do it for Kelly

10:54.250 --> 10:56.241
and all the other people
Crowe's cheated.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.241
All we got to do
is get back 400,000.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.239
That's all?

10:59.250 --> 11:01.241
Listen, I could get
my head handed to me

11:01.250 --> 11:02.740
for getting into something
like this.

11:02.750 --> 11:06.242
Pete... guy...

11:06.250 --> 11:07.239
you're dying to do it.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.781
You know it.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.248
Hmm?

11:11.792 --> 11:13.248
Yeah.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.786
It would be great,
wouldn't it,

11:14.792 --> 11:17.249
to see if we could out-bunko
Mr. Bunko himself?

11:18.250 --> 11:19.786
All right.

11:19.792 --> 11:21.783
I want everything you know
about bunko scams

11:21.792 --> 11:23.248
on my desk
in half an hour.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.282
Hey, wait a minute.
What about me?

11:27.291 --> 11:29.782
Hey, I'm the one who knows
all this stuff.

11:29.792 --> 11:32.784
Hey, guys!

11:36.291 --> 11:37.280
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:37.291 --> 11:39.282
the horses are coming out
on the track for the fourth race

11:39.792 --> 11:41.783
which will be run
at a distance of one mile.

11:41.792 --> 11:43.282
The last race was a bust.

11:43.291 --> 11:45.828
You know, Benny's obviously
not a very smart trainer.

11:45.834 --> 11:48.280
Smart trainers dope horses
when I tell them to.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.282
I think we need to have
a very active conversation

11:50.834 --> 11:51.823
with Benny.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.825
Find him.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.280
Again, as a reminder,

11:56.291 --> 11:59.283
scratches in the fourth race
are number three, Paranormal,

11:59.291 --> 12:01.828
and number seven, Nomaly.

12:03.834 --> 12:04.823
There's Crowe.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.322
How do I look?

12:08.333 --> 12:09.823
You look good.

12:09.834 --> 12:12.826
Here.

12:12.834 --> 12:13.823
Now you look great.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.823
Come on.

12:15.834 --> 12:18.826
The horses are approaching
the starting gate.

12:19.333 --> 12:19.833
Mac, I don't know.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.322
I'm telling you,

12:21.333 --> 12:22.322
I had this hot flash

12:22.333 --> 12:23.823
on Ireland's Own last night.

12:23.834 --> 12:24.869
What are you talking about?

12:24.875 --> 12:26.331
Ireland's Own is a mudder.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.869
She only runs in the rain.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.331
Well, so who did you bet on
for me then?

12:29.875 --> 12:32.867
Now if I tell you that,
it won't come true, remember?

12:32.875 --> 12:33.864
Okay!

12:35.875 --> 12:36.864
All right.
Let's go!

12:36.875 --> 12:37.864
Let's g...
Go!

12:37.875 --> 12:38.864
.
Hey, now...

12:38.875 --> 12:40.331
Come on, run, baby, run! Hey...

12:40.333 --> 12:41.322
Hey, buddy, knock it off,

12:41.333 --> 12:42.869
will you?
You are yelling in my ear!

12:43.333 --> 12:44.869
Knock it off,
or I'm gonna call the cops.

12:44.875 --> 12:45.864
A cop? You want a cop?
Yeah.

12:46.375 --> 12:47.364
You got one right here.
All right.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.366
Don't yell in my ear anymore.

12:49.375 --> 12:50.865
I'll run you in.
All right,
all right.

12:50.875 --> 12:51.364
For disturbing my peace.

12:51.875 --> 12:52.864
Okay.

12:52.875 --> 12:53.864
As the three-quarter folds,

12:53.875 --> 12:54.864
Chocaholic moves up

12:54.875 --> 12:55.364
and is now in plain position.

12:55.875 --> 12:56.864
All right, let's go.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.365
On the rail,

12:58.375 --> 13:00.866
Batter is Red is in the lead.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.867
Snow Miss is second by half
a length over Chocaholic.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.908
Chocaholic looks strong.

13:06.917 --> 13:10.364
And now it's Batter is Red
and Chocaholic.

13:10.375 --> 13:11.911
Okay. Come on, let's go.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.366
As they enter the wire,
it's Batter is Red...

13:14.375 --> 13:15.911
Hey, hey, look at him.
Hey, all right, all right.

13:16.375 --> 13:17.364
and Chocaholic neck and neck.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.364
And at the finish, it's

13:18.917 --> 13:20.908
Chocaholic, number two!

13:20.917 --> 13:21.906
Wins by a nose!

13:29.083 --> 13:30.914
Well, so what happened?
Did I win?

13:30.917 --> 13:33.909
When I'm hot, I'm hot, huh?

13:35.917 --> 13:37.908
MacGyver, I like your style.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.406
Yeah?

13:39.417 --> 13:41.908
You and me are gonna do things
together, buddy.

13:41.917 --> 13:42.906
Yeah? Like what?
Yeah.

13:42.917 --> 13:44.953
Well, first of all,
as soon as I get a little cash,

13:44.959 --> 13:45.948
I'm gonna give you a bonus.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.416
And second,
I'm gonna cut you in

13:48.417 --> 13:49.953
on the deal of your life

13:49.959 --> 13:51.950
if you don't mind
getting a little dirty.

13:52.959 --> 13:55.951
A little dirt never
hurt anybody.

13:56.959 --> 13:58.415
Hey, I got to get back
to the station

13:58.417 --> 13:59.406
before they miss me.

13:59.959 --> 14:00.948
Yeah.

14:04.959 --> 14:06.950
Deal of a lifetime, huh?

14:06.959 --> 14:08.950
Name's James Crowe.

14:09.458 --> 14:11.449
And that's a pretty lame con
you're running on the cop.

14:11.959 --> 14:13.449
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:13.458 --> 14:15.949
Please, Mr. MacGyver,
I heard and saw the whole thing.

14:15.959 --> 14:17.449
All the losing tickets,

14:17.959 --> 14:19.950
making your idiot cop think
you have the Midas touch.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.949
All you saw was
me making a friend real happy.

14:22.959 --> 14:23.948
That's it.

14:23.959 --> 14:25.995
Maybe I can make all three
of us happy.

14:26.001 --> 14:27.992
I don't mind
getting a little dirty, either,

14:28.001 --> 14:29.457
especially if I have
the added protection

14:30.001 --> 14:32.447
of a tarnished badge
in my pocket.

14:32.458 --> 14:33.447
I'm listening.

14:34.001 --> 14:34.990
Your cop mentioned

14:35.001 --> 14:36.992
he had a certain deal
he needed some cash for.

14:37.458 --> 14:38.994
Well, I might have
some ready cash.

14:39.001 --> 14:40.992
Of course, I'd have to be cut in
on the action.

14:41.001 --> 14:42.457
I might be able to arrange that.

14:43.001 --> 14:45.492
Maybe you and I tought to have
a more detailed conversation.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.992
Say, stables, 20 minutes.

14:49.001 --> 14:50.491
Done.

15:25.542 --> 15:25.997
Joanne?!

15:28.000 --> 15:29.991
What are you doing here?!

15:35.542 --> 15:36.531
What are you doing here?

15:36.542 --> 15:37.998
Following you.
Why?

15:38.542 --> 15:40.533
Because I'm tired of just
sitting in front of a computer.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.998
I need field experience.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.991
You picked a fine time
to try and get it.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.036
But you guys don't know stings
the way I do.

15:46.041 --> 15:47.030
I can really help you.

15:47.041 --> 15:48.531
I mean, like-like,
finding the mark

15:49.041 --> 15:49.541
and playing the con...
Shh!

15:50.041 --> 15:51.531
and roping the mark
and telling the tale.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.032
I know all this stuff
like the back of my hand!

15:53.041 --> 15:54.531
I appreciate everything
you're trying to do...

15:54.542 --> 15:56.533
Look, I want
to be where the action is.

15:56.542 --> 15:57.531
This way! This way!

15:57.542 --> 15:58.531
Bring him over here.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.578
Looks like you
just got your wish.

16:06.583 --> 16:09.040
Ever hear
of a blind trainer, Benny?

16:09.041 --> 16:12.033
Next time I tell you
to dope a horse,

16:12.041 --> 16:14.032
I'll bet you do it.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.039
MacGyver,
they're gonna kill him!

16:18.041 --> 16:19.577
We've got to do something!

16:19.583 --> 16:20.572
Yeah.

16:21.041 --> 16:22.577
Take him down that way.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.074
Bring him in there.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.072
Tony, keep an eye on him.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.574
Now we'll have a little fun.

16:42.583 --> 16:44.073
Come here.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.619
What are we gonna do?

16:46.083 --> 16:47.072
Give me a couple
of bobby pins.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.074
Bobby pins? Sure.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.619
Yeah.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.081
Great.

16:52.083 --> 16:54.620
Let me borrow this, and,
uh, a couple of buttons.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.081
Make it three.
Another MacGyverism!

16:57.625 --> 16:59.616
Oh.

17:01.625 --> 17:02.614
That's it.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.616
And let me borrow
your glasses, please.

17:04.625 --> 17:05.614
They're yours.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.615
Yeah, thanks.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.116
So what do we do now?

17:13.125 --> 17:15.616
You just did it.

17:15.625 --> 17:18.116
Huh, time to meet the bad guys.

17:29.667 --> 17:30.656
Yo, Crowe!

17:32.125 --> 17:33.661
Hey, I thought we were gonna talk.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.123
I thought
I told you 20 minutes.

17:35.125 --> 17:37.662
I guess my watch is
a little fast, huh?

17:37.667 --> 17:39.658
Yeah. Let him go.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.123
Listen, Benny, next time

17:41.125 --> 17:43.116
I'm really gonna have
to do some damage, you know?

17:43.125 --> 17:44.661
So don't let me down, huh?

17:44.667 --> 17:46.658
I'll do better
for you next time, Mr. Crowe.

17:46.667 --> 17:47.656
Yeah.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.656
I promise I will.
You better.

17:52.166 --> 17:53.155
Well,

17:53.166 --> 17:54.656
who's your friend?

17:54.667 --> 17:55.656
She has an admirer.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.657
A certain cop
you may have seen me with earlier

17:58.667 --> 18:01.158
who happens to be
in the narcotics division.

18:01.667 --> 18:02.156
Interesting.

18:02.667 --> 18:03.656
Now this cop has some

18:03.667 --> 18:04.702
pretty heavy gambling debts

18:05.166 --> 18:06.155
and with a little persuasion

18:06.166 --> 18:07.702
from Joanne, might
be convinced to, uh...

18:08.166 --> 18:09.702
To hook us into a nice
little cocaine deal

18:10.166 --> 18:12.157
he has going down
in the next couple of days.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.700
Right. Cocaine.

18:15.709 --> 18:17.165
Like she says.

18:17.166 --> 18:19.157
Well, I like a woman
with initiative.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.702
Tell me, you think
you'll be able to

18:21.166 --> 18:23.157
talk our narc friend
into this little proposition?

18:23.709 --> 18:26.200
Well, I've talked him
into propositions before.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.698
So, was I good?

18:35.709 --> 18:37.199
Oh, I was great!

18:37.208 --> 18:38.698
How'd you like the way I hooked him

18:38.709 --> 18:39.698
into the Toledo Twist,

18:40.208 --> 18:41.698
one of the best stings
I've ever researched?

18:41.709 --> 18:43.199
Yeah, Joanne, that's just great,

18:43.208 --> 18:45.745
except after reading all
the research you came up with,

18:45.750 --> 18:47.741
Pete and I decided
to go with the Boston Bang.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.741
Oh, that's all wrong for this.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.741
The Twist is much better.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.207
But that wasn't your decision
to make.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.199
Listen, have you researched
this stuff?

18:56.208 --> 18:57.744
No. Well, that's what I do.

18:57.750 --> 18:58.739
I've got it nailed.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.199
And the Toledo Twist is the
one to use.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.745
Could I have my glasses back?

19:06.250 --> 19:07.239
You can keep the bobby pins.

19:07.750 --> 19:08.739
Thanks.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.241
Mac,

19:11.250 --> 19:13.741
uh, you know Crowe
is gonna check on me,

19:13.750 --> 19:15.240
so I just had Data feed my cover

19:15.750 --> 19:16.739
into the police computer.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.740
I'm a visiting
narc on rotation.

19:18.750 --> 19:19.739
That's great, Pete.

19:19.750 --> 19:20.739
What's in the bag?

19:20.750 --> 19:24.242
Oh, uh, everything we're gonna need

19:24.250 --> 19:26.241
for the Boston Bang.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.241
Mac, it's gonna be terrific!

19:28.250 --> 19:29.786
Yeah.

19:29.792 --> 19:31.783
Pete, how do you feel
about the Toledo Twist?

19:32.250 --> 19:33.239
The Twist? Why?

19:33.250 --> 19:35.241
I've had my heart
set on the Boston Bang.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.786
Well, Joanne seems to think...
Joanne?

19:36.792 --> 19:38.783
Pete, trust me.
Don't ask her to explain.

19:38.792 --> 19:40.248
Just go with it.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.786
I just bought all this stuff!

19:41.792 --> 19:43.783
Besides, we'd need more people

19:43.792 --> 19:44.781
for the Toledo Twist.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.283
I know, and I got just the guy.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.280
Who?

19:48.291 --> 19:49.781
Our old friend, Kelly.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.783
But Crowe knows
what Kelly looks like.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.783
Don't worry.
He'll be wearing a beard.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.282
This better be good,
MacGyver.

19:59.291 --> 20:00.781
I got a busy day
ahead of me

20:00.792 --> 20:02.282
busting dingheads.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.828
I'm sure there's a proposition
that'll be of mutual benefit

20:04.834 --> 20:06.290
to both of us, Mr. Thornton.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.280
So, you're Crowe, huh?

20:07.291 --> 20:07.825
Mm-hmm.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.280
I'm listening.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.290
I understand
you know of a certain deal

20:11.291 --> 20:12.280
that's about to happen.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.282
That you may be willing
to split the profits

20:14.291 --> 20:15.827
for a partner
with some ready cash.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.825
Maybe.

20:17.834 --> 20:18.823
And that you're up to your

20:18.834 --> 20:19.823
neck in debt.

20:20.291 --> 20:21.280
What the hell are you doing

20:21.291 --> 20:22.280
telling this guy my business?!

20:22.291 --> 20:24.282
I ought to beat your brains out!

20:24.291 --> 20:26.327
Pete, he's got cash,
and we need it. Come on.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.322
Pete, get a hold of yourself.

20:27.333 --> 20:28.322
Come on, honey.
Come on!

20:28.333 --> 20:29.823
Let him go.
Pete...

20:29.834 --> 20:31.324
Come on.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.324
Okay, are we all friends
again here?

20:36.333 --> 20:37.322
Sure we are.

20:37.333 --> 20:38.322
Pete just gets
a little anxious

20:38.834 --> 20:39.823
sometimes, that's all.

20:39.834 --> 20:42.325
Listen, I've been working
on this deal for a long time.

20:42.333 --> 20:43.322
I don't want anybody
to screw it up.

20:43.834 --> 20:44.869
I'm just here to help.

20:44.875 --> 20:45.864
What can I do?

20:45.875 --> 20:47.331
We need a pound
of 90o/o pure cocaine

20:47.333 --> 20:48.322
to get the deal rolling.

20:48.333 --> 20:49.322
Can you score it?

20:49.875 --> 20:51.331
Yeah, but that's a nice chunk
of green

20:51.333 --> 20:52.869
you're asking me to lay out.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.331
You're a narc.
Why can't you get it?

20:54.333 --> 20:55.869
I'm risking enough already.

20:55.875 --> 20:58.332
Look, you don't want to buy in,
I'll find somebody who will.

20:58.333 --> 20:59.322
Hey, Pete,

20:59.333 --> 21:00.869
wait a minute! Come on!
What are you afraid

21:01.333 --> 21:02.322
he's gonna bust you for possession?

21:02.333 --> 21:03.322
Never entered my mind.

21:03.875 --> 21:04.864
If he tried,
I'd bury him for entrapment.

21:05.375 --> 21:06.364
Even he's smart enough
to know that.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.866
I just don't want to be left
sitting on a pound of snort.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.866
What, a guy like you
can't unload a pound of coke?

21:10.875 --> 21:12.365
Is that it?

21:12.375 --> 21:14.366
Maybe you're getting
a little too cautious.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.365
Yeah, maybe you're right.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.866
All right, tell your
hot-headed partner I'll do it.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.365
All right, meet me tonight.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.366
9:00 sharp at the Beverly Canyon
Hotel, suite 1611.

21:23.875 --> 21:25.911
Bring the coke with you,
have it in a plastic bag.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.374
Now what's going down?
I'll lay it all on ya
when I see the goods.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.373
Look, you show up,
you don't like what you see,

21:31.917 --> 21:32.906
you walk away.
It's as simple as that.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.364
Okay.

21:41.917 --> 21:43.373
Hey, not bad.

21:43.375 --> 21:44.911
You guys pick a nice place

21:44.917 --> 21:46.407
for a sting.

21:46.417 --> 21:48.908
Nothing but the best
for our friend Crowe.

21:48.917 --> 21:50.407
Everything set?

21:50.417 --> 21:51.907
Yeah, fine.

21:51.917 --> 21:52.906
Did you check your gun,

21:53.417 --> 21:54.406
make sure you're just firing blanks?

21:54.917 --> 21:55.906
Mac, I've already checked it twice.

21:55.917 --> 21:56.906
Come on.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.907
Oh, I just love this kind
of stuff!

22:00.417 --> 22:02.408
Well, I really do.

22:02.417 --> 22:04.408
Yeah.

22:19.417 --> 22:21.408
Show time.

22:21.417 --> 22:23.954
I hope Kelly's beard stays on.

22:28.458 --> 22:29.948
Everything ready?

22:29.959 --> 22:31.449
Yeah, right down here.

22:37.959 --> 22:39.449
Hey.

22:50.458 --> 22:51.447
Two-way mirror.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.994
Very nice.

22:53.001 --> 22:55.447
This setup looks
like the Sacramento Switch.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.994
Is that it?

22:57.001 --> 22:58.457
Yeah. So where's the stuff?

22:59.001 --> 23:01.447
Patience, Officer.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.449
You're sure that hasn't been cut
with anything?

23:03.458 --> 23:04.994
Top of the line cocaine,
my friend.

23:05.001 --> 23:06.491
Tested it myself.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.990
Oh boy, you got
to be a real bonehead

23:08.001 --> 23:09.491
to snort this stuff.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.489
That looks like the real thing.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.489
What is that, powdered milk?

23:11.500 --> 23:12.990
Among other things.

23:13.001 --> 23:14.491
Then when your buyer wants
to test the coke,

23:15.001 --> 23:15.990
you're gonna hand him my bag,

23:16.001 --> 23:17.491
and it's gonna test out
90o/o pure, right?

23:18.001 --> 23:19.491
So the dimwit
who's paying 300 grand

23:19.500 --> 23:21.991
for this stuff gets one pound
of high-grade toot...

23:22.001 --> 23:23.992
And nine pounds of powdered milk.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.991
You guys are okay.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.991
Ah, look at this guy.

24:01.542 --> 24:02.998
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

24:06.041 --> 24:07.531
All right.

24:07.542 --> 24:09.533
Let's see what the money buys.

24:28.041 --> 24:30.032
Okay.

24:30.041 --> 24:32.032
Pure as the driven snow.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.032
Oh, hold on, son.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.032
Let's not be too hasty.

24:40.041 --> 24:42.578
This boy's mama didn't raise
no dummy.

24:47.083 --> 24:48.072
Where did that come from?

24:48.083 --> 24:50.074
All right, just be cool.
Pete can handle it.

24:50.083 --> 24:51.573
No, this is going down bad.

24:51.583 --> 24:52.572
Put the gun away.

24:52.583 --> 24:54.073
Get away!

25:02.083 --> 25:02.572
Nailed him!

25:20.083 --> 25:21.072
Well, what the hell
are you doing?

25:21.083 --> 25:22.072
You want to be here
when the cops come?

25:22.083 --> 25:23.072
Everyone, out!

25:23.083 --> 25:24.573
What about my coke?
That is evidence!

25:25.083 --> 25:26.573
I've got to have something
to show to Internal Affairs.

25:26.583 --> 25:27.572
Come on, get out!

25:27.583 --> 25:29.073
Not all at once!

25:29.083 --> 25:31.074
I don't want it
looking like Grand Central Station.

25:31.083 --> 25:32.573
Crowe, you go first.

25:32.583 --> 25:34.073
All right, but I want
a meeting... tomorrow

25:34.083 --> 25:35.072
at the dam.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.072
- We'll be there.
- Noon.

25:36.083 --> 25:38.074
We'll be there!

25:40.625 --> 25:42.616
Kelly?

25:42.625 --> 25:44.081
Kelly?

25:44.625 --> 25:45.080
Kelly!

25:46.083 --> 25:48.620
I may be dead, but I'm not deaf.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.072
Oh, thank God
Crowe missed!

25:52.083 --> 25:53.072
You...

25:53.083 --> 25:55.620
These blood capsules look
pretty real.

25:56.083 --> 25:58.074
You know, you scared
the hell out of us.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.118
Yeah, you and me both.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.615
Oh, Kelly, you were terrific!

26:00.625 --> 26:03.116
Yeah, I even surprised myself.

26:03.125 --> 26:04.615
Well, this is one bag of coke

26:04.625 --> 26:06.115
that is not going
to hit the streets.

26:06.125 --> 26:07.615
It's as good as flushed.

26:07.625 --> 26:09.115
Mac, help me pick up
this money, will you?

26:09.625 --> 26:10.114
I want to get it back

26:10.625 --> 26:11.114
to the Foundation vault.

26:11.625 --> 26:13.115
You mean all this money is real?

26:13.125 --> 26:15.116
But you said it was fake.

26:15.125 --> 26:16.114
I didn't want you to get nervous.

26:16.625 --> 26:17.614
Are you telling me
you let this man

26:17.625 --> 26:19.661
carry around $300,000 in cash,

26:20.125 --> 26:21.114
and he thought
it was fake money?

26:21.667 --> 26:23.123
I didn't want to affect
his performance.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.123
Do you think Crowe bought it?

26:25.125 --> 26:26.114
Yeah.

26:28.125 --> 26:30.116
And tomorrow, we tell the tale.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.116
How'd it go?

26:33.125 --> 26:36.117
Not good. I want some insurance...

26:38.667 --> 26:40.157
...and she's it.

26:45.667 --> 26:48.659
Now follow her.
Find out where she lives.

27:00.166 --> 27:02.703
Okay, now let's go through this
one more time.

27:02.709 --> 27:03.698
Oh...

27:03.709 --> 27:05.165
Come on, it's good to be ready.

27:05.166 --> 27:08.158
Now, if Crowe asks
why MacGyver has to go

27:08.166 --> 27:09.702
into the police property
room with you...

27:09.709 --> 27:11.700
I just say
that it's a lot quicker

27:11.709 --> 27:15.156
for four hands to pack up
two million dollars than two.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.703
Right.
The rehearsal's over, kids.

27:21.709 --> 27:24.200
I lost money last night.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.199
I hate losing money.

27:26.208 --> 27:28.199
How'd you like to make
a million bucks in one day?

27:28.208 --> 27:30.199
You kill me, MacGyver.

27:30.208 --> 27:31.197
Come on, listen to me.

27:31.208 --> 27:32.698
The doper's money
from last night

27:32.709 --> 27:33.698
went into the
police property room

27:33.709 --> 27:36.200
which holds a whole lot more money.

27:36.208 --> 27:38.199
And I have easy access to
that property room.

27:38.750 --> 27:39.205
If you want in,
all you got to do

27:39.750 --> 27:41.206
is come up with 400,000, cash.

27:41.208 --> 27:43.199
We take your 400 grand
and turn it into two million

27:43.208 --> 27:44.744
once we get
into the police property room.

27:45.208 --> 27:46.197
Then we pull a switch.

27:46.208 --> 27:49.200
Spend 400,000, you make
a million dollars' profit.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.206
Why should I believe you?
You've already lost me money.

27:51.208 --> 27:52.744
Now I should give you more?

27:52.750 --> 27:53.739
Hey, wait a minute.

27:53.750 --> 27:55.206
You're the one that blew it last night.

27:55.208 --> 27:56.197
not us, Crowe.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.744
You're lucky we came back to you.

27:58.208 --> 27:59.243
Hey, listen, if you're

27:59.250 --> 28:00.239
not interested,
I mean, we...

28:00.250 --> 28:01.239
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

28:01.250 --> 28:04.242
All right.
Say I give you the cash.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.239
How do you pull this off?

28:05.250 --> 28:07.741
Joanne, get the suitcase.

28:14.750 --> 28:17.742
I put your money in a suitcase

28:17.750 --> 28:18.785
with a false bottom

28:19.250 --> 28:19.784
like this, see?

28:20.250 --> 28:21.239
Your money goes on top,

28:21.250 --> 28:23.241
because the watch commander
is going to check it,

28:23.250 --> 28:25.241
naturally, to make sure
it's real.

28:25.250 --> 28:26.786
And we put pop-up stacks

28:26.792 --> 28:28.248
of fake money in the false bottom.

28:28.250 --> 28:31.242
Just put the ends together like this,
and you got it, see?

28:31.250 --> 28:33.241
It's terrific.

28:33.250 --> 28:35.241
Looks good.

28:35.250 --> 28:36.239
Oh, they look a lot better

28:36.250 --> 28:38.787
with real money stacked
on top of them.

28:38.792 --> 28:40.783
Now, by the time they find out
that the money is gone,

28:40.792 --> 28:42.282
there'll have been so many
people in and out of there,

28:42.291 --> 28:43.781
they'll never know who took it.

28:43.792 --> 28:44.781
So tomorrow, Mac and Pete go

28:45.291 --> 28:46.781
down into the police
property room with the suitcase

28:46.792 --> 28:48.282
at exactly two minutes to 1:00.

28:48.792 --> 28:49.281
Pete tells
the watch commander

28:49.792 --> 28:50.781
he got the money
in a drug bust.

28:51.291 --> 28:53.282
The watch commander gives me
the key to the property room,

28:53.792 --> 28:55.282
and then he goes to lunch
at 1:00.

28:55.291 --> 28:56.781
And he just leaves you alone
in the room?

28:56.792 --> 28:59.283
I'm a cop! Cops trust cops.

28:59.834 --> 29:00.823
MacGyver's not a cop.

29:00.834 --> 29:03.280
He's the witness
to the crime.

29:03.291 --> 29:04.280
I have to take his statement

29:04.834 --> 29:06.290
as soon as I'm through
in the property room.

29:06.291 --> 29:09.829
And then MacGyver helps me
load the money.

29:09.834 --> 29:11.825
Four hands are better
than two.

29:12.291 --> 29:14.282
Not bad, not bad.

29:14.834 --> 29:15.823
Now, what are you going to do
about the two million?

29:15.834 --> 29:17.290
You can't take it out in that.

29:17.834 --> 29:19.825
The Brockman trunk.
It's a case Pete was handling.

29:19.834 --> 29:21.324
It's finally going
to trial tomorrow.

29:21.333 --> 29:23.324
You see, Mr. Brockman killed
his fourth wife.

29:23.333 --> 29:24.823
He hid her body in a trunk.

29:24.834 --> 29:26.324
I have been subpoenaed
to take that trunk

29:26.333 --> 29:28.324
out of the property room
tomorrow

29:28.333 --> 29:30.324
and down to the court
as evidence.

29:30.333 --> 29:32.324
And, Mr. Crowe,
here's the topper.

29:32.333 --> 29:34.324
That trunk is just
about the right siye

29:34.333 --> 29:36.824
to hold two million dollars.

29:44.333 --> 29:47.325
If I lose 400 grand
on this deal,

29:47.333 --> 29:49.870
you're going to wish
you never laid eyes on me.

29:53.875 --> 29:54.864
What do you mean,
it's too dangerous?

29:54.875 --> 29:56.866
This whole thing was my idea.

29:56.875 --> 29:57.864
I don't believe you guys.

29:57.875 --> 29:59.365
After all I've done,

29:59.375 --> 30:00.865
you're not going to
let me be in on the touch.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.866
I can't be responsible
for you out there

30:02.875 --> 30:03.864
if anything goes wrong.

30:03.875 --> 30:05.365
I'm not asking you to be.

30:05.375 --> 30:07.366
No good! You're out of it.

30:07.375 --> 30:09.866
My decision.

30:24.917 --> 30:26.908
A peace offering, huh?

30:26.917 --> 30:27.906
Come on in.

30:28.917 --> 30:30.908
Thank you.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.912
Interesting breakfast.

30:39.917 --> 30:43.409
I always photograph
strange things when I'm angry.

30:43.917 --> 30:45.407
You must get angry a lot.

30:45.417 --> 30:47.408
So, I'm still not going
with you guys tomorrow?

30:47.417 --> 30:50.409
No, and you know
it's for your own good, too.

30:50.417 --> 30:51.406
My own good.

30:52.417 --> 30:55.409
So, what's in the bag?

30:55.417 --> 30:57.408
Pastrami on rye.

30:57.417 --> 31:00.409
You call that a peace offering?

31:00.417 --> 31:01.953
Oh, terrific.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.950
I'm always blowing a fuse.

31:03.959 --> 31:06.951
Come on, I have some
extras in the kitchen.

31:09.959 --> 31:11.950
MacGyver...

31:14.417 --> 31:15.953
Phone's dead.

31:19.458 --> 31:20.948
Got a flashlight?

31:20.959 --> 31:22.950
This battery should do it.

31:22.959 --> 31:24.950
I need some matchbooks, too.

31:24.959 --> 31:27.450
Okay.
Two of them.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.950
All I have to do is connect
your floodlight wires

31:35.959 --> 31:37.950
to this battery.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.491
This should bridge the gap.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.489
What are you going to do?

32:16.500 --> 32:17.990
I'm going to try and
brighten their evening

32:18.500 --> 32:19.489
a little bit.

32:59.542 --> 33:00.531
Come on!

33:18.542 --> 33:20.032
Mac!

33:26.041 --> 33:28.032
What's going on, Crowe?

33:28.583 --> 33:30.574
Well, let's just say if I'm
going to give you 400 grand,

33:30.583 --> 33:32.574
I'm going to need
a little insurance policy.

33:32.583 --> 33:33.572
What do you want?

33:33.583 --> 33:34.572
Simple.

33:35.041 --> 33:37.578
Tomorrow, we'll meet outside the
Decker Street police station.

33:38.041 --> 33:39.076
You'll go in
with my money,

33:39.083 --> 33:41.074
you'll do the little switcheroo
in the property room,

33:41.083 --> 33:42.072
you'll put the two million
dollars in the trunk,

33:42.083 --> 33:43.072
and you'll bring it out to me,

33:43.083 --> 33:44.573
and then I'll give you the girl.

33:44.583 --> 33:45.572
When?

33:46.083 --> 33:47.072
Don't worry, MacGyver.

33:47.083 --> 33:48.573
Girl's going to be with me.
I'm going to be nearby.

33:48.583 --> 33:49.572
You'll get her
when I get the trunk.

33:49.583 --> 33:51.574
What if I say no to your deal?

33:51.583 --> 33:53.073
Well, then she's dead.

33:53.083 --> 33:54.072
MacGyver!

33:56.583 --> 33:57.572
It's a deal.

33:57.583 --> 33:59.073
She's yours.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.074
Yes.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.619
Come on.

34:21.625 --> 34:24.617
I should have known Crowe
would cover his flanks.

34:24.625 --> 34:26.616
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.616
Yeah. We got cocky.

34:28.625 --> 34:31.116
Look, Joanne is going
to be all right...

34:31.125 --> 34:33.616
as long as Crowe needs her.

34:35.125 --> 34:38.117
Pete...

34:38.125 --> 34:40.661
Crowe's always slipped
through the cops' fingers

34:40.667 --> 34:43.123
by using
legal technicalities, right?

34:43.125 --> 34:44.114
Yeah.

34:44.125 --> 34:47.663
Well, what if the cops found him

34:47.667 --> 34:49.658
in their property room

34:49.667 --> 34:51.658
with his hand
in the till?

34:51.667 --> 34:54.123
That'd be a little tough
to explain, don't you think?

34:54.125 --> 34:56.116
Well, sure,
but our plan didn't include

34:56.125 --> 34:58.116
taking Crowe into the
police station with us.

34:58.125 --> 34:59.661
What if we convince him
that we can't be trusted

34:59.667 --> 35:00.656
with his money?

35:00.667 --> 35:02.157
Then he'd want to go in,
wouldn't he?

35:02.166 --> 35:03.155
But why should he?

35:03.166 --> 35:04.155
He knows we're not going
to do anything funny

35:04.667 --> 35:06.157
as long as he's got Joanne.

35:06.166 --> 35:08.157
Unless he thinks
we don't care about her.

35:54.208 --> 35:57.200
You got the whole 400,000
in there?

35:57.208 --> 35:58.197
That's all of it.

35:58.208 --> 36:00.199
You got the fake money in here?

36:02.750 --> 36:05.742
Very good. Okay.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.745
Yeah, I love the smell
of money, don't you?

36:09.750 --> 36:11.741
Nothing like it.

36:11.750 --> 36:13.741
Clears the sinuses
, you know what I mean?

36:13.750 --> 36:15.741
By the way,
your girlfriend says hello.

36:15.750 --> 36:18.207
Oh, yeah? Good.

36:18.750 --> 36:21.742
Well, give us about,
uh, 20 minutes,

36:21.750 --> 36:23.741
and we'll be back with,
uh, two million dollars.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.240
Wait a second,
wait a second.

36:25.250 --> 36:27.241
You gentlemen seem
a little too eager here.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.239
What about the girl?

36:28.250 --> 36:29.740
You didn't ask about her.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.740
How is she?

36:31.750 --> 36:33.240
Oh, she's fine.

36:33.250 --> 36:36.742
She's watching us right now
with a gun pointed at her head.

36:36.750 --> 36:39.787
Oh, she's out here.
You're not going to find her.

36:39.792 --> 36:42.784
Well, looks like
you got us, Crowe.

36:42.792 --> 36:44.248
Hold it. Maybe this girl
doesn't mean

36:44.250 --> 36:45.239
as much to you
as I thought.

36:45.792 --> 36:47.783
That girl... is my life.

36:47.792 --> 36:48.781
Yeah, right.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.786
And everybody's got a price.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.786
I'm going in with you.

36:52.792 --> 36:53.247
Nobody's going to handle

36:53.792 --> 36:54.247
my money but me.

36:54.792 --> 36:56.248
Uh, now, wait a minute.
That's crayy.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.241
My plan didn't include you
going into the property room.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.285
Just MacGyver.

36:59.291 --> 37:00.781
Instead of having one witness

37:00.792 --> 37:02.783
to your supposed drug bust,
you're going to have two.

37:04.291 --> 37:06.282
When you see me come down
with the trunk,

37:06.291 --> 37:07.781
send the girl out.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.783
Come on!

37:20.291 --> 37:22.282
Thanks, but no thanks.

37:30.834 --> 37:32.290
Now move to that door.
What?

37:32.834 --> 37:34.290
Don't say a word. Move!

37:53.333 --> 37:54.823
Well, you know,

37:54.834 --> 37:56.825
you guys are really
gonna get it this time...

38:21.375 --> 38:23.866
I guess you don't remember me,
do you, Crowe?

38:23.875 --> 38:25.365
But then you don't remember
any of the people

38:25.875 --> 38:26.864
you conned out
of their life savings.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.366
Look familiar?

38:36.875 --> 38:38.365
Do you hear that, honey?

38:38.375 --> 38:40.366
'Cause if your boys
don't come up with the money,

38:40.375 --> 38:43.367
then you're history.

38:43.375 --> 38:44.911
Get him in there!

38:44.917 --> 38:45.906
Get him

38:45.917 --> 38:48.374
down in there! Yeah.

38:48.375 --> 38:49.364
One peep out of you, Crowe,

38:49.375 --> 38:50.911
you'll never live
to see daylight again.

38:58.917 --> 39:00.407
Have a nice day.

39:09.417 --> 39:11.908
All right,
easy, easy.

39:13.417 --> 39:14.406
Got it.

39:19.959 --> 39:20.948
Good luck.

39:21.417 --> 39:22.953
Thanks.

39:22.959 --> 39:23.948
Come on.

39:31.417 --> 39:33.408
Oh, thanks.

39:34.959 --> 39:36.950
How you doing?

39:48.959 --> 39:50.449
Well, what can I do you for?

39:50.458 --> 39:52.449
Sergeant Thornton.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.948
I got a trunk
here with a lot of coke in it.

39:53.959 --> 39:54.948
I had a lousy bust.

39:55.458 --> 39:56.948
The guy got away,
but I got his stash.

39:56.959 --> 39:57.948
Lucky you.

39:57.959 --> 39:59.449
What about him?

39:59.458 --> 40:02.450
Oh, the detective and I are
very attached to one another.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.995
He's a pickpocket.

40:05.001 --> 40:05.990
I got to get him downtown

40:06.001 --> 40:06.990
for an arraignment hearing

40:07.458 --> 40:08.447
as soon as we're through here.

40:31.001 --> 40:32.992
So, are we gonna get this booked
in already?

40:33.001 --> 40:34.491
I got a busy day ahead of me.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.492
Sure, but you got
to have a 314, seven-two-A form

40:37.500 --> 40:38.990
before I can do anything.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.490
Okay, but I got to get

40:45.500 --> 40:47.991
the watch commander's
John Hancock on this.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.990
Wait here.

41:12.542 --> 41:13.998
Pete?

41:38.041 --> 41:39.577
Hey.

41:39.583 --> 41:40.572
Yeah?

41:41.041 --> 41:43.032
You readin' the sports section?

41:43.041 --> 41:44.030
No. You-You want it?

41:44.041 --> 41:45.030
Yeah, thanks.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.574
I'll give it back
to you as soon as I'm done.

41:48.583 --> 41:50.574
Uh, sure.

42:18.083 --> 42:19.619
Uh, Sarg, uh,
I need your okay

42:19.625 --> 42:21.616
on this, please.

42:41.125 --> 42:42.114
Shh!

42:46.125 --> 42:47.615
Uh, Joe, I'm kind of in a hurry.

42:48.125 --> 42:50.116
Could you get the sarge
to okay?

43:22.166 --> 43:22.666
Go.

43:25.166 --> 43:26.656
I'm lookin'
at two dead men!

43:27.166 --> 43:28.656
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

43:28.667 --> 43:30.157
You're dead meat,
MacGyver!

43:30.166 --> 43:31.656
You're both dead!

43:31.667 --> 43:33.157
You're dead meat!

43:46.166 --> 43:48.157
What's taking them so damn long?

43:48.166 --> 43:49.702
Take it easy.

44:05.208 --> 44:06.698
Excuse me, I...

44:06.709 --> 44:08.199
No, no, you first.

44:08.208 --> 44:09.197
Hmm.

44:11.709 --> 44:13.700
...Give me your hand.

44:41.750 --> 44:42.739
Now,

44:43.250 --> 44:45.741
Mac, this part, we
take nice and easy.

44:53.250 --> 44:54.740
Sarge, I need your, uh,
autograph here.

44:54.750 --> 44:56.240
Do you mind?

44:56.250 --> 44:57.239
There's a line here. Hmm?

45:11.250 --> 45:12.786
That's Crowe.

45:12.792 --> 45:14.248
Come on.

45:32.291 --> 45:33.781
Howdy.

45:36.792 --> 45:37.781
What? Are you stupid?

45:37.792 --> 45:39.282
What, are you gonna shoot him?

45:39.291 --> 45:40.827
There's a million cops out here.

45:40.834 --> 45:41.823
Where the hell's Crowe?

45:41.834 --> 45:43.825
Who cares?
Let's get the money.

45:43.834 --> 45:45.825
Okay, I'll get the van.

45:48.291 --> 45:50.282
Thanks.

45:50.291 --> 45:52.282
You know, you could
have been a doctor.

46:05.333 --> 46:06.823
Who the hell are you?

46:06.834 --> 46:07.823
I'm-mm-mm...

46:07.834 --> 46:09.324
And what are you doing
in my cage?

46:17.333 --> 46:18.322
Gee, you're all tied up.

46:18.333 --> 46:19.869
Maybe I should come back
a little later.

46:19.875 --> 46:22.332
M-MacGyver!

46:22.333 --> 46:23.322
MacGyver?

46:23.333 --> 46:25.324
Yeah, the pants could come in
a little,

46:25.333 --> 46:26.322
but they're not bad, huh?

46:26.333 --> 46:27.869
Come on.

46:30.875 --> 46:32.331
Quick! There were two other guys
here, too.

46:32.875 --> 46:34.866
With a trunk!

46:34.875 --> 46:37.332
20 years on the force,
I never had so much excitement!

46:42.375 --> 46:43.865
You're not gonna just
let them get away!

46:43.875 --> 46:46.366
No, I think the bottom's
about to fall out

46:46.875 --> 46:48.365
of that plan.

46:51.875 --> 46:53.866
That's the guy.

46:56.875 --> 46:57.864
Freeye! Hands up!

46:57.875 --> 46:59.911
Get your hands up!

47:01.917 --> 47:03.373
Come on!

47:05.917 --> 47:07.373
Whoa!

47:07.375 --> 47:08.911
So what do you think
now, Kelly?

47:08.917 --> 47:10.908
Hey, after helping you guys
pull this off,

47:10.917 --> 47:11.906
I feel like
I can do anything.
