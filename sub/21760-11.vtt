Oh, it's a good thing

01:16.960 --> 01:20.330
you gave away most
of those old teddy bears.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.500
You had almost
as many of 'em
as you do puppies!

01:47.000 --> 01:49.460
Wh-- whoa!

01:56.210 --> 01:57.380
Ah! Oh!

01:57.380 --> 01:59.210
Rolly! Whoa-- oh!

02:02.170 --> 02:04.380
What are you guys
doing in here?

02:04.380 --> 02:06.750
You pups are always
getting in the way.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.750
Go on, scoot!

02:08.750 --> 02:09.790
Oomph!

02:09.790 --> 02:10.920
-Whoa!

02:10.920 --> 02:13.420
Whee! Bless my soul!

02:13.420 --> 02:14.960
Oww!

02:18.170 --> 02:21.000
I know you love all
these little guys, Roger,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.210
but I've always thought
you've had way too many.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.830
Way too many?

02:25.830 --> 02:28.330
-Don't worry, Rolly.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.500
I'm sure it's not
what it sounds like.

02:30.500 --> 02:34.000
Roger's much too sweet
to give us away.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.380
Roger:
Well, truth is I'm glad

02:35.380 --> 02:36.920
we're finally
giving them all away...

02:36.920 --> 02:39.170
-even though I'm gonna miss
their fuzzy little faces.

02:39.170 --> 02:41.170
Why that cold-hearted,

02:41.170 --> 02:43.500
dog-ditching,
two-legged traitor!

02:44.830 --> 02:46.710
Oh, there, there, Roger.

02:46.710 --> 02:48.880
I'm sure
it's for the best.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.830
I know, but they were
practically family.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.000
Roger said we're
always getting in the way.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.710
So that's it.

02:55.710 --> 02:57.620
They're giving us away.

02:57.620 --> 03:00.620
Throwing us out
like day-old pizza.

03:00.620 --> 03:03.500
Nobody'd really do that,
would they--

03:03.500 --> 03:05.380
to a pizza, I mean?

03:05.380 --> 03:09.290
Oh, well,
they're tossing us out
on our furry little butts.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.830
Wait a minute.

03:10.830 --> 03:12.290
I'm a feather-butt.

03:12.290 --> 03:14.620
Maybe this doesn't
include me.

03:15.750 --> 03:17.830
Cruella on P.A.:
Lunch break has begun.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.830
At the tone,
you have 29 minutes...

03:20.830 --> 03:22.040
- and 40 seconds

03:22.040 --> 03:24.380
until you must
get back to work.

03:27.710 --> 03:29.580
-Memo to myself...

03:29.580 --> 03:32.580
-consider intravenous lunches.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.250
Chewing is too
time-consuming.

03:42.710 --> 03:46.710
Hmm, there's an employee
after my own heart.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.960
Oh, of course Anita.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.960
What dedication!
What loyalty!

03:52.960 --> 03:55.080
What is that?

03:55.080 --> 03:57.710
Those designs
don't look like anything

03:57.710 --> 03:59.540
I've ever taken credit for.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.580
They're way too good.

04:01.580 --> 04:03.710
She must be moonlighting.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.620
I bet she's working
for my competition,

04:06.620 --> 04:09.830
that fashion scab
Ralphie St. Lowrent!

04:10.830 --> 04:12.750
Oh! If that's the case,

04:12.750 --> 04:16.170
I'll slap that ingrate
with a lawsuit so enormous,

04:16.170 --> 04:18.080
her grandchildren
will owe me money!

04:19.460 --> 04:21.380
Get me Horace and Jasper!

04:26.710 --> 04:28.540
Now the only reason
I'm donating

04:28.540 --> 04:30.790
these little guys
to "Cruella Cares"

04:30.790 --> 04:33.120
is that I know
they'll be given
to deserving kids.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.330
Cruella on P.A.: Attention,
Teddy Bear shoppers:

04:49.330 --> 04:51.380
there's a special on
my new "Teddy de Vil"--

04:51.380 --> 04:53.620
two for the price of three,
six for the price of twelve,

04:53.620 --> 04:54.920
twelve for
the price of eight.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.120
Oh, just buy them!

04:58.420 --> 05:00.460
Cruella:
Six minutes
and 20 seconds

05:00.460 --> 05:02.540
until you must
get back to work.

05:02.540 --> 05:03.750
Ooh, uh-oh,

05:03.750 --> 05:05.790
better grab a bite
before lunch break's over.

05:13.290 --> 05:14.380
Ahh.

05:17.670 --> 05:18.670
Hmm.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.750
Anita:
Okay, okay,
I'll be right there.

05:25.540 --> 05:27.670
Hello? Roger!

05:27.670 --> 05:28.830
You got the stuff?

05:28.830 --> 05:30.000
Great.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.250
No, no, no,
I'm on my lunch break.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.540
So it's my time,
not Cruella's.

05:34.540 --> 05:36.620
Listen, I'll pick up
the other things after work.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.210
I got to get back
to my designs now

05:38.210 --> 05:40.750
for you know what.
Bye.

05:44.250 --> 05:47.710
Now. Now.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.750
Woman on P.A.:
Will Anita Dearly come
to the front desk immediately?

05:59.170 --> 06:01.500
Woman on P.A.:
Will Anita Dearly please
pull chair from under desk,

06:01.500 --> 06:03.000
then come to front desk?

06:06.080 --> 06:07.620
Ooh!

06:07.620 --> 06:09.750
Get to work.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.290
Lucky:
No really!

06:18.290 --> 06:20.080
We heard Roger
and Nanny talking.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.920
What's going on
with our pets?

06:21.920 --> 06:24.670
Now, now, you pups
just stay out of it.

06:25.670 --> 06:28.830
-But, Dad!
-You'll find out
soon enough.

06:28.830 --> 06:30.420
-Perdita: Pongo.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.670
Nanny needs you
back inside right away.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.830
Ah-ah-ah, sorry, Lucky.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.210
-No pups allowed.

06:42.290 --> 06:43.620
Did you hear that?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.830
They might as well
be throwing confetti

06:45.830 --> 06:48.120
and yelling bon voyage!

06:49.880 --> 06:52.170
I don't handle
rejection well!

06:53.330 --> 06:56.080
Although, I have
revenge down pat.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.420
What are you two
doing here?

07:13.420 --> 07:17.620
H and J, high-tech
employee surveillance
consultants

07:17.620 --> 07:18.920
at your service.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.380
We got everything
you need to spy.

07:22.460 --> 07:24.540
We've got night-vision goggles.

07:24.540 --> 07:25.580
Oh!

07:25.580 --> 07:28.000
We've got state-of-the-art
hidden cameras.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.420
The best money can buy.
We can even tap phones.

07:31.420 --> 07:32.500
Jasper:
Knock, knock.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.960
Enough!

07:35.170 --> 07:37.790
I didn't call you
for high-tech surveillance.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.830
I summoned you
because I need

07:41.830 --> 07:45.210
two mindless dimwits
to go through the trash.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.170
Not my trash, you idiots!

07:53.170 --> 07:55.540
-Anita Dearly's.

07:56.540 --> 07:57.500
Both: Oh!

08:01.380 --> 08:03.330
We're in luck.
She's out of the office.

08:12.790 --> 08:13.920
It's empty.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.750
Both:
Geronimo!

08:31.580 --> 08:33.210
-Uh.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.170
Hey, here's something.

08:42.170 --> 08:44.500
From the desk
of Anita Dearly.

08:45.670 --> 08:46.830
-Oh, ooh!

09:05.040 --> 09:06.210
We've got it!

09:07.380 --> 09:08.460
Ew.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.170
Not that it.
This it.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.500
Ahh.

09:12.500 --> 09:18.080
"10:00 AM, Saturday
in the barn"?

09:18.080 --> 09:20.250
That must be
when she's making
her presentation

09:20.250 --> 09:21.290
to Ralphie!

09:21.290 --> 09:22.420
Follow her!

09:22.420 --> 09:24.250
See where she goes,

09:24.250 --> 09:25.380
who she meets,

09:25.380 --> 09:26.790
what she says,

09:26.790 --> 09:30.420
and how she could
turn on me this way!

09:31.500 --> 09:34.620
You will be secretly wired
for sound and video.

09:34.620 --> 09:37.500
-Both: Whoa!
-Now get out and
get on the job!

09:39.000 --> 09:41.460
Good, everything
is in working order.

09:58.170 --> 10:01.750
Nanny:
So, uh, what did
Cruella actually say?

10:01.750 --> 10:04.120
Well, she wasn't there...

10:05.290 --> 10:06.830
but her assistant
said she'd be thrilled

10:06.830 --> 10:09.170
to receive so many
wonderful little creatures.

10:09.170 --> 10:10.790
Cruella.

10:10.790 --> 10:13.420
They're giving us
to Cruella?

10:17.790 --> 10:19.420
Cruella on P.A.:
At the tone,

10:19.420 --> 10:21.000
- you will have 15 hours...

10:21.000 --> 10:24.080
53 minutes and 40 seconds

10:24.080 --> 10:26.120
until tomorrow's
workday begins.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.500
We've picked up the subject,
Ms. de Vil.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.000
Jasper:
And where ever she goes,
we go.

10:58.380 --> 11:00.920
The subject appears
to be selecting--

11:00.920 --> 11:05.210
Cruella:
Wrapping paper,
party streamers,

11:05.210 --> 11:08.000
and noise makers.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.620
Well, this fashion show

11:09.620 --> 11:11.500
must have
a birthday party theme.

11:13.170 --> 11:15.540
Party hats with clowns!

11:15.540 --> 11:18.830
How fresh!
How frolicsome!

11:20.290 --> 11:23.250
Memo to myself,
brilliant new idea
for the fall line:

11:23.250 --> 11:24.580
clown-wear!

11:29.540 --> 11:31.290
Ralphie:
Yo', Anita!

11:31.290 --> 11:33.210
What are you
doing in these parts?

11:33.210 --> 11:36.120
I didn't know Cruella
let you out at night.

11:38.710 --> 11:41.790
Jasper:
Anita's just made contact
with Ralphie.

11:41.790 --> 11:43.170
I knew it!

11:43.170 --> 11:45.080
That proves
she's been working

11:45.080 --> 11:46.500
for that two-bit tailor!

11:46.500 --> 11:49.250
Cruella:
Don't let them
out of your sight!

11:51.210 --> 11:52.710
So, anyway,
I was just--

11:52.710 --> 11:54.170
-Both: Whoa!

11:55.290 --> 11:56.460
What are they saying?

12:00.170 --> 12:03.170
So tell me, Anita,
when are you going
to leave that witch

12:03.170 --> 12:04.380
and come work for me?

12:04.380 --> 12:07.250
Oh, I can't
do that to Cruella.

12:07.250 --> 12:09.250
She gave me my start.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.170
I gave her
her start!

12:12.170 --> 12:15.710
Anita must be
trying to sell Ralphie
her new designs !

12:17.500 --> 12:22.080
But if that traitor
thinks she can pull
the Angora over my eyes...

12:23.290 --> 12:26.750
she's in for
an unpleasant surprise!

12:36.670 --> 12:40.500
I can't believe our pets
would give us to Cruella!

12:40.500 --> 12:43.330
Maybe she sucked out
their brains

12:43.330 --> 12:45.420
or-- or did
a Vulcan mind-meld.

12:45.420 --> 12:46.750
It happens!

12:46.750 --> 12:49.000
Maybe we should
look at the bright side.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.710
We're beginning
down the road less traveled--

12:51.710 --> 12:54.040
the start of
a brand-new life.

12:55.710 --> 12:59.330
Sorry, I was just trying
to put a positive spin on doom.

13:01.420 --> 13:03.500
Yeah, they're up there now,

13:03.500 --> 13:05.580
probably planning
to turn our barn

13:05.580 --> 13:07.920
into an all-night
yogurt stand.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.170
I can't take this any more!

13:10.170 --> 13:12.120
I got to see for myself.

13:25.960 --> 13:29.830
As long as you work
for the House of De Vil,

13:29.830 --> 13:32.040
all your designs
belong to me,

13:32.040 --> 13:34.210
and I'm coming
to claim my property!

13:40.210 --> 13:42.000
As a member
of this household,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.080
I deserve to know
what's going on.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.040
How could they
do this to us?

13:46.040 --> 13:48.250
We're their puppies.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.420
They're family.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.750
How could Anita
do this to me?

13:51.750 --> 13:54.710
I'm her employer.
I'm practically family.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.920
Who would have thought
that a surprise party

13:56.920 --> 13:58.120
could be so much work?

13:58.120 --> 14:01.250
Roger:
But you know, the pups have
been with us 101 days now,

14:01.250 --> 14:03.790
and we've got to
do something to celebrate!

14:10.250 --> 14:12.040
At last!

14:12.040 --> 14:15.460
Anita's latest
fashion designs
will be mine!

14:15.460 --> 14:19.120
-What we need
is a nice cup of tea.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.540
And I'll make sandwiches.

14:20.540 --> 14:22.880
Keep sewing, Roger.

14:24.420 --> 14:25.540
Will do.

14:32.790 --> 14:34.040
Oh!

14:49.120 --> 14:50.250
Hmm?

15:02.500 --> 15:04.880
Cruella--
she was there with them!

15:04.880 --> 15:06.250
Then it is true.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.210
We're family valueless.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.250
We better warn
the other pups!

15:10.250 --> 15:12.460
Right, then first thing
tomorrow morning

15:12.460 --> 15:13.540
we're out of here.

15:13.540 --> 15:16.080
Cruella will never
take us alive.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.710
Scorchy,
I have to sneak into

15:23.710 --> 15:27.170
Anita's birthday-party themed
fashion show tomorrow,

15:27.170 --> 15:31.920
and make such a ruin
of her presentation to Ralphie

15:31.920 --> 15:34.960
that no one will
attempt such treachery

15:34.960 --> 15:36.830
against the House of De Vil

15:36.830 --> 15:38.120
ever again!

15:38.120 --> 15:41.790
Fortunately, I have a plan.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.210
Not so fast, puppies!

15:58.210 --> 16:01.250
The others might not believe
Cruella's out to get us,

16:01.250 --> 16:03.920
but I do,
and I'm coming
with you!

16:03.920 --> 16:07.120
But no one wants
to give you away.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.960
Hey, you guys
are my best buddies.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.420
Wherever you go,
I go.

16:12.420 --> 16:14.670
-Hmph.
-What a pal!

16:14.670 --> 16:17.750
Hey, if I'm really
leaving Dearly farm,

16:17.750 --> 16:19.880
I'd better go home
and pack my things.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.500
Meet us at the rock!

16:21.500 --> 16:23.120
-Lucky: We're sailing away...

16:23.120 --> 16:25.000
...to where Cruella
can never find us.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.460
What things
could a chicken
possibly have?

16:29.460 --> 16:31.250
Don't ask.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.120
Stuff, stuff,
got to get my stuff!

16:42.750 --> 16:45.330
Nanny:
Oh, stretch the streamers
that way.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.000
-I'll stack the puppies'
presents over here.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.620
Oh, this'll be
the best surprise party ever!

16:52.620 --> 16:55.580
Oh, wait till the pups
hear about this.

16:57.170 --> 16:59.120
Ship Captain:
Even if we have to sail

16:59.120 --> 17:01.960
around the world
three times,

17:01.960 --> 17:07.000
we're not coming back
without the great white whale!

17:09.750 --> 17:11.460
Not a bark or a whimper

17:11.460 --> 17:13.420
until we're out of sight
of land.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.670
I wonder where Spot is.

17:15.670 --> 17:18.380
Oh, I hope
they haven't left yet!

17:21.830 --> 17:24.420
-Well, Cadpig,

17:24.420 --> 17:27.420
it's the start
of a whole new life.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.540
Lucky, I'm conflicted.

17:29.540 --> 17:32.580
I can't tell
if I'm suffering
from abandonment issues

17:32.580 --> 17:34.380
or separation anxiety.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.830
Captain:
Raise the gangplank!

17:41.880 --> 17:44.040
Look, it's Spot!

17:44.040 --> 17:46.580
And head for the open sea!

17:46.580 --> 17:49.040
Rolly:
Come on, Spot, go for it!

17:49.040 --> 17:52.920
-No! No! No!

18:08.500 --> 18:13.710
Around the world and back
ain't what it used to be.

18:13.710 --> 18:14.880
My pants!

18:19.920 --> 18:21.500
Listen up, pups,

18:21.500 --> 18:23.460
I've got great news!

18:30.880 --> 18:32.920
Surprise!

18:32.920 --> 18:36.330
Happy 101st birthday,
everyone!

18:37.330 --> 18:38.960
-Anita: Uh, uh...

18:48.750 --> 18:50.460
Oh, papa!

18:50.460 --> 18:53.880
-Presents!

19:13.170 --> 19:15.500
We've even got
something for the chicken.

19:29.620 --> 19:31.710
Thanks for not
giving us away, Mom.

19:31.710 --> 19:33.790
Where did you get
an idea like that?

19:33.790 --> 19:34.830
Don't ask.

19:34.830 --> 19:37.830
Spot:
Cock-a-doodle-doo,
look at me.

19:37.830 --> 19:39.830
I'm a dalmatian too.

19:39.830 --> 19:42.120
-Oh, ha ha ha!

19:42.120 --> 19:44.380
-Yuck, yuck, yuck! Ha ha!

19:50.250 --> 19:52.290
Here's a little
bunny for you.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.620
-Uh, a doggie.

19:54.620 --> 19:56.380
-Uh, drat.

19:56.380 --> 19:59.250
Here, have a worm.
You too.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.880
Now go fish!

20:00.880 --> 20:02.540
Worms for everyone!

20:09.080 --> 20:11.540
This is worst clown
I've ever seen.

20:11.540 --> 20:12.960
No kidding.

20:12.960 --> 20:17.210
Hmm, Ralphie St. Lowrent
still hasn't arrived?

20:17.210 --> 20:19.830
And why are
these wretched dogs

20:19.830 --> 20:21.580
wearing Anita's clothing line?

20:21.580 --> 20:22.830
Ah, no matter.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.210
In two minutes,
it won't make any difference

20:25.210 --> 20:27.080
-because Anita's fashion show...

20:27.080 --> 20:29.830
will be over and out.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.330
Touch the clown again

20:39.330 --> 20:41.920
and we'll be serving
hot dogs for supper!

20:41.920 --> 20:44.750
Something smells funny
about this clown.

20:44.750 --> 20:48.170
-Duh, Lucky.
-No, I'll show you.

20:56.170 --> 20:57.750
What's going on?

20:57.750 --> 21:00.170
I'm flying!

21:00.170 --> 21:02.460
Both:
Who hired the clown?

21:09.080 --> 21:10.080
Oomph!

21:13.330 --> 21:17.620
Cruella? That's why
you were in my office
yesterday.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.750
You were trying to find out
when the birthday party was

21:21.750 --> 21:23.750
so you could help
make it a success.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.830
Hmm? Uh, oh!

21:25.830 --> 21:27.250
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

21:28.380 --> 21:30.040
It's not as if I--

21:30.040 --> 21:33.120
I suspected you
of moonlighting
for Ralphie St. Lowrent.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.790
and came to sabotage
your new clothing line,
or anything.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.960
How could I ever work
for anyone else

21:38.960 --> 21:40.670
-when you are so generous...

21:41.710 --> 21:44.670
Ah, well,
like I always say,

21:44.670 --> 21:47.580
trust your employees.

21:50.750 --> 21:51.620
Uh-oh.

21:51.620 --> 21:53.500
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

22:09.210 --> 22:11.790
Happy 101st birthday.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.620
You mutts.
