WEBVTT

00:11.400 --> 00:12.500
What?

00:12.500 --> 00:14.800
You know what.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.600
Still the lake?

00:16.600 --> 00:18.300
You know wt?
Forget it.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.500
Whatever.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.800
We can talk about it,
Thea.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.600
I said, "forget it."

00:24.600 --> 00:26.700
You know, the haley sisters
Finally invited me to --

00:26.700 --> 00:30.100
The haley sisters
Are 17 and 18, thea.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.800
What's that
Supposed to mean?

00:31.800 --> 00:35.400
Well, usually that means beer,
Cigarettes, and older boys.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.700
I'm 14.
I can handle myself.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.200
Then you can also handle
Keeping your promises.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.100
This sucks.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.100
Look,
I know you're flattered

00:45.100 --> 00:47.500
That the haley sisters invited
You to go to the lake with them.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.700
"flattered"?

00:49.700 --> 00:53.700
They're the most popular girls
In high school.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.300
You made me a deal,
Sweetheart.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.500
Got  stick to it.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.200
But --
[ knock on door ]

00:58.600 --> 01:01.300
I'm lookin
For karmstrong.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.200
Yeah. That's me.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.100
My name is temple davis.
I'm supposed to start today.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.000
Ali: oh, my god.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.600
Professor alpert is the most
Boring professor i've ever

01:09.600 --> 01:11.000
I can hardly
Keep my eyes open.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.400
I have fallen asleep
Every single class.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.800
All right. Forget it. No school.
We're gonna go.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.700
Tom: are you sure
You want to do this?

01:20.700 --> 01:22.700
I am.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.100
If you agree

01:24.100 --> 01:26.400
To share your donor liver
With another patient --

01:26.400 --> 01:32.900
Dr. Griffith tells me that it has to be a smaller person
(????)

01:32.900 --> 01:36.100
And that it could
Even be a child.

01:36.100 --> 01:39.400
This is true,
But you should be aware

01:39.400 --> 01:41.900
That it makes
An already dangerous procedure

01:41.900 --> 01:43.800
Much more complicated.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.700
I know.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.800
I'll take it up
With the chief of staff, okay?

01:54.800 --> 01:56.800
It's a blessing.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.100
You had to go
And do that.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.300
I only made him aware
Of what i knew.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.900
You had to go
And do that.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.400 --> 02:21.600
So, i drive two hours in
A recovery called east redneck.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.300
I get in there,

02:22.300 --> 02:25.900
And the supposedly
Brain-dead donor blinks at me.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.900
I mean, some of these rural
Hospitals must think the doctor

02:27.900 --> 02:30.700
Is gonna shoot the patient if he
Comes in with a broken leg.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.200
[ chuckles ] teddy.
They should know.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.800
????

02:35.800 --> 02:37.100
You can google it.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.500
Guys,
This is temple davis.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.300
This is teddy desilva
And lynn robbins,

02:42.300 --> 02:43.600
Your new colleagues.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.400
Patient -- jacob grier,
51, autoimmune hepatitis.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.200
Played point guard for pitt,
Didn't he?

03:06.200 --> 03:08.100
Yeah, he did
Back in the day,

03:08.100 --> 03:10.300
But now he runs a church
Over on the north side.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.000
He's actually expressed
An interest in splitting

03:12.000 --> 03:14.300
The next liver available
With another recipient.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.900
Only after being asked
By dr. Griffith.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.800
Dr. Griffith
Is eager to perform

03:18.800 --> 03:20.900
His first
Split-liver recovery.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.000
Did the patient
Agree to this?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, it's not
An easy procedure.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.600
You have to spend two
Extra hours splitting
The liver in the cadaver.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.400
But you get to save
An extra life.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.100
If the patient agreed to it
And you two are okay with it,

03:35.100 --> 03:36.500
I'm okay with it.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.600
All right.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.300
I am so off my game.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.400
I haven't closed a donor
In six weeks.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.000
You'll get the next one.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.800
Lynn here hasn't missed one
In two months.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.900
I'm starting
To take it personally.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.800
What's all this?

03:53.800 --> 03:56.200
We're getting ready
For donor appreciation day.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.300
Usually it's dead bodies.
Today it's arts and crafts.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.700
We tie cards on balloons
For each donor.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.100
????

04:04.100 --> 04:05.300
And let them go.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.100
It's really very touching.

04:07.500 --> 04:10.700
All you have to do is write the
Donor's first name on a card.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.600
I'm going across the street
To see dad.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.100
What?
Gonna go talk to dad.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.500
Thea?

04:17.399 --> 04:18.300
What?

04:19.600 --> 04:22.700
Now i'm not even old enough
To cross the street, huh?

04:22.700 --> 04:24.300
I can't believe that.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.400
????

04:43.300 --> 04:44.500
Swing it around.

04:52.800 --> 04:57.500

05:03.100 --> 05:04.700
The two victims were both shot
In the head,

05:04.700 --> 05:06.800
And the suicide
Is also a gsw to the head.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.600
That's good.
What?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.200
And by "good,"
I mean a good percentage

05:10.200 --> 05:12.000
Of our successful
Multi-organ recoveries

05:12.000 --> 05:13.500
Come from gunshot wounds
To the head.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.600
????

05:14.600 --> 05:16.000
???

05:35.100 --> 05:36.900
Thea's here.
Did you have a fight?

05:37.700 --> 05:38.900
We had an argument

05:38.900 --> 05:41.000
About the haley sisters
And pinehurst lake.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.700
She can't stay with me.
I've got too much --

05:42.700 --> 05:46.700
Nathaniel,
I have my hands full right now.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.800
Right.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.200
I'm sorry.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
You could ask her to go to
My office, or she can go home.

05:55.700 --> 05:56.800
Okay.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.900
I just can't imagine.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.100
I know.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.900
This is the sheriff.
His name is bradley rogers.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.900
He was 42 years old.
No donor card.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.800
Let me take
The sheriff's family.
Teddy...

06:26.400 --> 06:27.900
I just have a feeling
About this one.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.300
I think it's a better
Idea for you to take
The shooter's mother.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.300
Why?
Because of who i am?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.100
Teddy.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.700
I'm not the obvious choice here,

06:35.700 --> 06:37.100
But i can do this one.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.200
Okay.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.300
Second victim's name
Is ali york.

06:53.300 --> 06:56.500
18 years old.
Has a donor card.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.600
Just help her parents
Understand her wishes.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.900
Mrs. Donner: duane donner?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.400
That must be...
The shooter's mom.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.500
Right this way,
Mrs. Donner.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.200
Come with me.
You should watch this.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.600
????

07:23.500 --> 07:25.600
Nate: your mother says you can
Either go back to her office

07:25.600 --> 07:27.000
And finish your work
Or go home.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.900
"my mother says"?
I have to work, sweetheart.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.900
Yeah. Right.
Thea, i don't have time
For this nonsense.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.200
I don't want to go back
And sit in mom's office all day.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.800
The haley sisters finally
Invited me to pinehurst lake.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.500
It's a no, okay?

07:39.600 --> 07:42.000
Now, i will either take you
To mom's office,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.500
Or i will drive you home and
Call someone to stay with you.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.000
You just don't get it.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.600
Daddy?

07:56.400 --> 07:58.000
Dad?

07:58.200 --> 07:59.500
Okay.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.400
What?

08:02.400 --> 08:04.300
It's a beautiful day.

08:04.300 --> 08:07.900
Let's go get your swimsuit
And drive out to the lake.

08:17.600 --> 08:21.000
Mrs. Donner,
My name is kate armstrong.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.700
This is temple davis.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.500
We work at the local
Organ recovery center.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.300
My sister
Is supposed to come.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.300
She said
I should get a lawyer.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.400
Mrs. Donner, we were told

08:35.400 --> 08:37.299
The doctors spoke with you
About your son

08:37.299 --> 08:40.600
And that you understand he
Won't recover from his injury.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.799
Duane shot himself
In the head.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.100
So...

08:47.000 --> 08:49.100
No coming back
From that.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.800
We'd like to help you with
Some end-of-life decisions.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.600
No, i already
Identified my son.

08:59.600 --> 09:05.800
There's not going to be
A funeral, and so...

09:05.800 --> 09:09.600
We'd like you to consider
Donating his organs.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.000
Mrs. Donner.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.700
Excuse me.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.400
Mrs. Donner?

09:19.800 --> 09:21.200
Mrs. Donner?

09:28.700 --> 09:31.100
Is everyone really dead?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.100
There's no chance?

09:37.100 --> 09:38.800
They're all dead.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.000
I have to
Get out of here.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.700
Mrs. Donner, i understand
You want to leave,

09:44.700 --> 09:47.500
But there's no one else to deal
With your son's death.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.200
But i can't.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.400
Yes, you can.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.600
You're his mother.
You're all he has right now.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.500
You're all he has.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.700
????

10:12.400 --> 10:15.000
The doctors want to take
Your son off the ventilator

10:15.000 --> 10:17.300
And send him
To a funeral home.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.600
That's fine.

10:20.600 --> 10:25.700
Please consider allowing us
To recover his organs.

10:25.700 --> 10:29.100
I promise you we will
Take very good care of him,

10:29.100 --> 10:36.000
And i promise his organs
Will go to very good use.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.800
I don't think my sister
Is gonna come.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.300
I don't think she wants
To be around this.

10:45.900 --> 10:48.200
Well, we're happy to stay here
For a while while you --

10:48.200 --> 10:52.200
Why would anyone want any part
Of my son now?

10:54.800 --> 10:56.800
Mrs. Donner...

10:56.800 --> 11:00.300
There are people who will die
Without a heart

11:00.300 --> 11:02.100
Or lungs.

11:02.100 --> 11:06.900
And they will only see your son
As someone who saved their life.

11:06.900 --> 11:10.000
But will they know?

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
That's not something you need
To worry about right now.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.700
I don't think i want them
To know.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.800
You'll know,
Mrs. Donner.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.400
You'll know.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.500
Hey, we just got word.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.700
One of the victims is a match
For reverend grier.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.600
Consent signed?
We're waiting.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.300
Heard you and dr. Grant
Broke up.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.700
Are you okay?

11:38.700 --> 11:41.700
They found a second recipient
To go with reverend grier.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.900
Child?

11:42.900 --> 11:44.600
Not exactly.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
Well, he is small.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.100
Well, let's see.

11:52.100 --> 11:56.100
Liver failure
Due to hepatitis c.

11:56.200 --> 11:56.900
Right.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.700
And i'm guessing
He didn't get that

11:58.700 --> 12:01.900
From digging latrines
In the peace corps.

12:01.900 --> 12:05.900
History of drug overdose.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.200
A case of syphilis
In the '80s

12:09.200 --> 12:11.400
And two bouts
Of chlamydia.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.100
Yes, the point is
He's a very sick man now,

12:14.100 --> 12:15.500
And we can help him.

12:15.500 --> 12:19.100
Hey, doc, why don't you stop
Talking to your girlfriend

12:19.100 --> 12:22.800
And give me some morphine?

12:22.800 --> 12:25.000
A very sick man.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.500
This is so cool of you.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.400
What?

12:38.400 --> 12:40.400
To drop me off here.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.600
Who says
I'm dropping you off?

12:42.600 --> 12:46.600
Y-you're not invited,
Dad.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.600
It's a public park,
Honey.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.900
Please don't, okay?

13:04.100 --> 13:06.300
His blood pressure
Is dropping.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.200
We need to start him
On dopamine

13:08.200 --> 13:11.200
And give him two more units
Of red blood cells.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.900
But we've already given him
So much blood.

13:13.900 --> 13:16.600
We need to treat him like
Any other living patient.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.000
In order to keep his organs
In perfect condition,

13:19.000 --> 13:20.100
We need to care for him

13:20.100 --> 13:22.400
Like we would someone
Who was still alive.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.900
<i>don't think too much
About what he did.</i>

13:27.900 --> 13:29.400
<i>just think about
What he can do.</i>

13:29.400 --> 13:31.600
I'm trying.
It's just that --

13:31.600 --> 13:34.100
Gunshot wounds to the head
Are notoriously unstable.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.100
We need to keep very close tabs
On him.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.000
Believe me,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.700
We're the only people
In this hospital who will.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.000
I think i screwed up
With the yorks.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.200
I think i blew it.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.000
What happened?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.500
It was going fine,
And then i said,

13:46.500 --> 13:50.500
"even though three people died
Today, if they all donate,

13:50.700 --> 13:54.400
Dozens could get a chance
To live."

13:54.400 --> 13:55.900
You said, "if they all."

13:55.900 --> 13:59.200
Oh, i mean,
It just went so quiet.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.200
Why is that so bad?

14:01.200 --> 14:03.300
Well, they know we're trying
To get duane donner's organs.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.900
I think
They know that now.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.400
Okay.
I'm gonna go talk to them.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.200
You stay with mr. Donner,
And let me know

14:09.200 --> 14:11.400
If his heart rate
Drops below 60.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.400
Mr. And mrs. York?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.500
Mother of that animal --

14:24.500 --> 14:26.800
Did she agree
To donate his organs?

14:28.900 --> 14:32.200
I'm afraid that information
Is confidential, mr. York.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.500
She could do that,
Right?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.100
To make herself feel like
He was worth anything,

14:36.100 --> 14:37.900
She could do that.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.900
Hal, let's just
Finish this.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.500
I just have
A few more questions.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.300
Okay.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.600
Has your daughter
Been hospitalized

14:59.600 --> 15:02.100
In the last two years?

15:02.100 --> 15:05.900
This is the first time she's
Ever been in the hospital.

15:05.900 --> 15:11.700
Did your daughter have
Any piercings or tattoos?

15:11.700 --> 15:15.000
You know, i saw him hooked up
To the machine,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.500
Nurses trying to save
His useless life!

15:17.500 --> 15:18.700
Hal!

15:19.500 --> 15:20.800
I'm sorry.
We can't do this.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.300
We just need to -- we just need
To get her out of here now.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.000
The sheriff's family
Signed the forms.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
The labs are back.
The operation room is scheduled.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.900
And the slump is over.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.800
What? What?

15:40.800 --> 15:42.500
What is it?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.600
Nothing.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.100
Nothing. Um...

15:47.800 --> 15:49.800
Really good work, teddy.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.000
Thanks.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.800
Very proud of this one.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.600
Tom: we found a donor.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.100
So we'll take you upstairs,
Prep you for surgery.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.900
And once we take a look
At the donor's liver --

16:10.900 --> 16:12.900
So we feel confident
That it'll work --

16:12.900 --> 16:15.900
Did you find a recipient?

16:15.900 --> 16:17.300
We did.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.800
Is it a child?

16:19.800 --> 16:22.400
No, he was a man
In his 50s.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.400
Does he have a family?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.800
No.

16:31.600 --> 16:35.300
All the same, he gets
Another chance like me.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.800
I hear you.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.700
Excuse me.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.400
So, what is it?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.800
Well, mr. Stubbs had ascites
Caused by the cirrhosis.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.100
Well, did you drain him?

16:52.100 --> 16:55.600
I did, but now his kidneys
Are deteriorating.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.800
[ exhales ]
Hepatorenal syndrome.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.000
If we don't transplant him soon,
His kidneys will fail, too.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.700
Nate:
Who tied this granny knot?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.500
This kind of knot
Won't even hold my daughter.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.300
Surgeon's knot
Should do it.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.099
Dad.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.500
At least i hope it'll do it.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.400
His systolic pressure
Dropped down to the 30s.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.400
You gave him pressors?

17:42.400 --> 17:46.400
He was at 15 mics of dopa,
And i just started 5 of epi.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.500
More dopamine?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.300
No, just leave it
Where it is.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.400
What are you doing?

17:55.400 --> 17:57.700
Sometimes they respond
To touch.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.800
Come on.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.600
He's stabilizing.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.300
He's not a human being!
He's not a person!

18:13.300 --> 18:14.300
Security!

18:14.300 --> 18:16.800
He killed my daughter!
He killed my daughter!

18:16.800 --> 18:19.400
???
He killed my daughter!

18:19.400 --> 18:21.900
My baby girl!
He killed --

18:21.900 --> 18:24.700
He killed my little girl!

18:24.700 --> 18:26.300
God!

18:27.100 --> 18:28.500
You raised this child!

18:28.500 --> 18:30.600
You did this!
This is your fault!

18:30.600 --> 18:32.300
Get down on your knees

18:32.300 --> 18:35.300
And have the courage
To confess.

18:35.300 --> 18:38.000
Have the courage
To confess.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.900
It's a beautiful day.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.400
You're crazy.
[ laughs ]

19:11.700 --> 19:15.100
I'm not so sure
I've been doing my best.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.300
What do you mean?

19:18.300 --> 19:20.400
Well...

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
You're growing up
So damn fast.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.100
And time --
It's hard to explain,

19:25.100 --> 19:29.100
But time just goes
So much faster.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.400
What is it?

19:37.400 --> 19:39.800
Sometimes...

19:39.800 --> 19:43.000
When you talk to me
[exhales]

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Sometimes it just doesn't feel
Like you're really here.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.200
What do you mean?

19:49.200 --> 19:53.000
You're always at the hospital,
I think.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.200
But i'm not.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.600
You spend every day

19:55.600 --> 19:58.500
Trying to give strangers
More time to live,

19:58.500 --> 20:02.500
You know, do what they want,
Maybe be with their families.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.700
Right.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.300
It's your time you're
Giving away, you know.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.200
It's your time.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.400
It's the hospital, right?

20:26.400 --> 20:27.600
I have to --

20:27.600 --> 20:29.500
You have to go?

20:29.500 --> 20:31.000
I do.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.000
Can i stay?

20:36.300 --> 20:38.100
You can stay.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.900
Oh, thank you.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.600
????

20:49.600 --> 20:51.300
The minute that this
Starts getting tricky,

20:51.300 --> 20:53.500
I'm gonna take the whole liver
For my patient.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.600
I understand.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.200
I'm not adding
Any more risk.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.100
Fair enough.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.200
It's not because you manipulated
A man of the cloth

20:59.200 --> 21:00.700
To get this opportunity.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.600
Dr. Grant told me if i could
Get any patient to consent --

21:03.600 --> 21:05.600
The reverend grier?
I mean, come on.

21:05.600 --> 21:09.000
You took advantage of this man's
Professional background.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.400
I asked.
He consented.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.100
Please.

21:13.100 --> 21:16.900
Let's get started.
Scalpel?

21:16.900 --> 21:19.000
This has nothing to do with you
Wanting to show dr. Grant

21:19.000 --> 21:20.400
That you know how to do
This procedure?

21:20.400 --> 21:23.200
Dr. Jonas?
Of course i want to try
The procedure. Don't you?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.100
If we get it down, we can save
Twice as many liver patients.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.100
????

21:26.100 --> 21:26.900
Point taken.

21:26.900 --> 21:29.100
So we're good.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.900
Dr. Jonas,
Take a look at this.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.100
Okay. Call it a day.

21:34.100 --> 21:34.900
What is it?

21:34.900 --> 21:38.300
See that? There's a nodule
Of cancer on his liver.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.000
We can't even use
His organs.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.700
This man has cancer.
You got to send him back.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.100
They're getting ready
To take her off the vent

22:00.100 --> 22:01.900
And send her
To the funeral home.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.900
Mr. York?

22:14.900 --> 22:18.200
If you're here for her organs,
You better walk away.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.800
I'm not.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.900
Are you one
Of her doctors?

22:24.900 --> 22:28.400
No.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.700
Who are you?

22:30.700 --> 22:33.200
I'm a surgeon,

22:33.200 --> 22:36.200
And i'm here because --

22:36.200 --> 22:38.700
Because i know
What happened.

22:42.100 --> 22:45.600
And i'm a father, too.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.400
And i'm so sorry.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.200
Mr. York...

22:54.200 --> 22:56.100
I'm just so sorry.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.800
I'm sorry, teddy.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.500
They can't use
The sheriff's organs.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.300
I know.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.400
I should just quit.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.300
Teddy --

23:23.300 --> 23:27.300
I can't make any
Of these things work.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.100
It's not your fault.

23:30.100 --> 23:33.100
The family
Goes through all this...

23:33.100 --> 23:35.900
Accepts his death...

23:35.900 --> 23:37.600
Agrees to donate...

23:37.600 --> 23:43.000
And it doesn't work out.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.700
Teddy, there was
A cancerous mass.

23:45.700 --> 23:48.100
Nothing showed up on our tests.
It happens.

23:48.100 --> 23:52.000
But to get
All the way there...

23:52.000 --> 23:54.500
And to have to
Tell them again.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.600
It's the worst part
Of our job.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.900
It's a second death.

24:01.900 --> 24:05.300
Isn't there some comfort
In knowing if it was cancer,

24:05.300 --> 24:09.300
He might've avoided,
You know...

24:10.100 --> 24:11.800
Later?

24:11.800 --> 24:14.200
There's no comfort.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.600
Their dad got shot
In the head,

24:17.600 --> 24:21.400
And now they can't even donate
His organs.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.500
They're not comforted.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.800
They're not happy.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.700
Why don't you
Take a moment?

24:31.700 --> 24:35.700
I know how this sounds...

24:35.900 --> 24:40.200
But i finally,
Finally got a consent.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.800
From a cop's wife,
No less.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.300
????

24:53.700 --> 24:55.300
Ali york

24:55.900 --> 24:58.200
Multiple orga donor

25:23.000 --> 25:24.600
Kate: an operating room
Just opened up.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.900
If you could just stay
With the donners

25:25.900 --> 25:29.600
While i offer the organs.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.600
I'd rather not.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.300
Temple, stay with the donners.
Make sure he's stable.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.300
But...

25:34.900 --> 25:37.400
This is a potential
Eight-organ donor.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.600
Can you do this, or should i
Bring someone else in?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.600
I can do it.

25:45.600 --> 25:50.300
Temple, you just need to
Remember why we're doing this,

25:50.300 --> 25:53.200
How many people are waiting.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.900
You're right.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.000
Thank you.

26:08.600 --> 26:09.800
Hey.
Hey.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.100
I was looking for you.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.000
How you doing?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.200
It's been...
It's been a day.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.600
Are you all right?

26:17.600 --> 26:21.000
Of all the days to be training
A new coordinator.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.300
Anyway, i have an organ
For you.
Oh, great.

26:23.300 --> 26:29.800
A liver for a patient
Named mitchell stubbs.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.200
Mr. Stubbs?
Mm-hmm.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.500
His kidney failure put him
At the top of our list.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.900
Right.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.400
Is there a problem?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.600
No.

26:44.600 --> 26:48.600
Should i send
The liver on?
No. No problem.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.600
The operating room
Has been arranged.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.000
Okay.
I'll be down in a few minutes.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.300
Great.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.700
Mr. Stubbs,
We have some good news.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.800
We've located an organ
For you.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.700
Is it the donner kid?

27:07.700 --> 27:10.000
We can't disclose the name
Of the donors.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.500
It's got to be
The donner kid.

27:13.500 --> 27:16.600
Mr. Stubbs,
Can you focus for a moment?

27:18.600 --> 27:20.100
So, a liver
Has become available,

27:20.100 --> 27:23.000
And you're now first
On the recipient list...

27:23.000 --> 27:23.600
Okay.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.900
...which means we need to
Ask your permission

27:25.900 --> 27:27.900
To share the organ.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.200
What?

27:29.200 --> 27:31.200
You were brought to st. Jude's
Because another recipient

27:31.200 --> 27:33.600
Was kind enough to share
His donated liver with you,

27:33.600 --> 27:37.000
So we need to make sure you're
Comfortable doing the same.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.600
I can have my own?

27:38.600 --> 27:40.500
You can.

27:40.500 --> 27:43.200
Then i want my own.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.200
Mr. Stubbs --

27:44.200 --> 27:47.200
If it's mine,
I want it.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.500
Hey.
So we're good, right?

28:02.500 --> 28:03.800
What?

28:05.900 --> 28:07.500
He -- he won't.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.200
He won't what?

28:09.200 --> 28:11.200
He won't share the liver.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.600
Oh, come on.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.800
Reverend grier was gonna
Give him half,

28:16.800 --> 28:19.300
And now he gets nothing?

28:19.300 --> 28:20.300
I'm sorry.

28:20.300 --> 28:24.300
But mr. Stubbs
Wouldn't even be here.

28:24.300 --> 28:27.900
Vancouver, you had to go
Take advantage, didn't you?

28:27.900 --> 28:29.400
Dr. Jonas --
Look, you know what?

28:29.400 --> 28:32.600
I just wanted one thing
In my life to be clear.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.000
This was
A simple situation

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Where we could've done some good
For a good person.

28:38.300 --> 28:42.100
Dr. Jonas, your operating room
Is ready.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.400
Oh ???

29:00.800 --> 29:02.100
Duane donner

29:02.500 --> 29:05.100
Multiple organ donor

29:24.400 --> 29:25.800
How'd it go?

29:25.800 --> 29:27.400
We got 'em all.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.200
They all look good?

29:28.200 --> 29:31.000
All eight.
Perfect condition.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.400
Did you take thea home?

29:33.400 --> 29:37.400
No. I took her out
To pinehurst lake.

29:38.100 --> 29:39.400
What?

29:39.400 --> 29:41.200
I took her out there,
I made sure she was okay,

29:41.200 --> 29:43.400
And then i left her
With her friends.

29:44.900 --> 29:48.700
We do our best, katie,
But we're not always deliberate.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.600
You know, we practice
Benign neglect,

29:50.600 --> 29:52.600
And we don't want
To pay the price for it.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.000
I don't think
We're neglecting her.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I'm not trying to undermine
Your decisions.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.800
I just mean that --

29:58.800 --> 30:00.600
I don't know.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.600
When i saw
That dead girl today,

30:04.600 --> 30:09.700
I just thought, "it's such
A beautiful day outside."

30:13.100 --> 30:16.200
It was just
Such a beautiful day.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.900
So, you'll get a letter from me
In a few days

30:26.900 --> 30:29.700
With some of the details --
Where your son's organs ended up

30:29.700 --> 30:33.200
And some broad information
About the recipients.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.200
I could meet them?

30:35.200 --> 30:39.200
In time, if you wanted to,
And if they agree.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.900
They'd never agree,
Not to meet me.

30:41.900 --> 30:43.800
Mrs. Donner,
You never know.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.500
People aren't always
What you expect.

30:46.500 --> 30:47.600
Well...

30:49.200 --> 30:50.600
Hold back.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.600
Sorry, folks,
Can't go in.

30:52.600 --> 30:56.600
We can keep you here
For a while, if you'd like.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.900
They want to talk to me.

30:58.900 --> 31:02.900
They want to know why he did
What he did.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.500
I'm sure they do.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.100
Maybe the answer is me.

31:09.100 --> 31:14.400
Maybe this happened because
Of the things i didn't do.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.800
But you couldn't
Have known.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.700
You couldn't have known.

31:25.900 --> 31:27.400
Yeah.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.200
You're angry with me?

31:53.200 --> 31:54.600
I am.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.600
I'm sorry if i --

31:59.600 --> 32:02.100
You walked away
From our agreement.

32:02.100 --> 32:02.700
I did.

32:02.700 --> 32:05.100
And manipulated your father
Into getting what you wanted.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.000
I didn't.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.200
You did.

32:10.700 --> 32:14.700
When you are with me,
It's my rules.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.100
You don't go to your father
And ask for them to be changed.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.400
It was fine, mom.
I had so much fun and --

32:20.400 --> 32:21.500
Fun?

32:21.500 --> 32:23.900
You had fun.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.700
Well, that's terrific,
Thea.

32:25.700 --> 32:28.400
You lied to me, went somewhere
You weren't supposed to go,

32:28.400 --> 32:31.300
So if that's your idea
Of fun --

32:31.300 --> 32:33.100
Temple: kate?

32:33.600 --> 32:37.100
Are we done now, or do we still
Have paperwork to file?

32:37.100 --> 32:41.100
We've got about an hour
Of charting left to do at least.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.900
Why don't you wait here?
I'll bring it up.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.600
Knock, knock.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.700
I asked dad
To drop me off here.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.600
I was wondering
If you wanted some help.

33:32.600 --> 33:36.600
I could do some of these
For you, if you want.

33:49.700 --> 33:53.700
So many people.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.500
Mm-hmm.

33:57.300 --> 34:00.600
It's sad.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.000
Sometimes.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.400
I meant for you and dad.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.500
It's got to be sad.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
So it was fun?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
What?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.600
At the lake?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.600
Yeah.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.400
Were the boys cute?

34:35.900 --> 34:38.400
Hmm...yeah.

34:40.699 --> 34:42.800
And they were nice to you?

34:42.800 --> 34:46.400
Yes, mom,
They were nice to me.

34:48.400 --> 34:49.900
I'm glad.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.699
I'm glad.

35:20.900 --> 35:24.700
Looks like a pretty day.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.600
I haven't been out yet.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.300
You stayed here the whole night
Finishing those cards?

35:29.300 --> 35:30.400
Mm-hmm.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.300
Temple...

35:38.200 --> 35:43.400
Yesterday i -- i hope
I didn't push you too hard.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.600
Did i?

35:51.600 --> 35:52.500
Didn't you feel

35:52.500 --> 35:57.800
That maybe giving
The killer's organs was --

35:57.800 --> 36:04.300
I don't know --
In a way morally wrong?

36:05.100 --> 36:07.600
Morally?

36:08.100 --> 36:14.500
I stood there, and i held
That man's hand, okay?

36:17.200 --> 36:20.500
I saw what he did to that girl
And that cop.

36:22.600 --> 36:25.000
And i held his hand.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.200
Temple...

36:29.600 --> 36:32.900
What he did
Was morally wrong.

36:34.900 --> 36:37.200
But his organs saving
Other people's lives

36:37.200 --> 36:40.700
Was probably the only just thing
To come out of that situation.

36:49.900 --> 36:53.400
I don't know
If i can do this.

36:55.500 --> 36:59.500
Well, i promise you
It gets easier.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.600
Is that true,

37:02.600 --> 37:06.200
Or do you just get used to
How hard it is?

37:15.800 --> 37:18.200
Come on.

37:18.200 --> 37:22.200
Why don't you help me take
These cards to the park?

37:23.400 --> 37:26.300
You'll like this.

37:33.700 --> 37:36.000
Reverend grier?

37:37.400 --> 37:39.700
Reverend grier?

37:46.300 --> 37:48.100
Hey.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.100
Are you coming
To this thing?

37:50.100 --> 37:53.600
No, i'm gonna stay here
In case an organ comes in.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.600
Listen, i wasn't trying
To push mr. Stubbs up the list.

37:58.600 --> 38:02.100
I just -- i was just trying
To relieve his pain.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.700
Well, you did what you did,
Dr. Griffith.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.700
I am not here to tell you
You did the wrong thing.

38:07.700 --> 38:09.000
Yeah, but the result --

38:09.000 --> 38:10.100
Listen.

38:10.100 --> 38:14.100
????

38:36.100 --> 38:37.900
We thought
We scared you off.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.200
Almost.
[ chuckles ]

38:39.800 --> 38:42.600
Is that
Duane donner's balloon?

38:42.600 --> 38:44.400
It is.

38:44.900 --> 38:48.700
It's the right thing to do,
Remembering him despite --

38:48.700 --> 38:51.400
I know.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.200
Do you want me
To take it?

38:55.500 --> 38:57.000
I've got it.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.400
This is for you.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.700
[ chuckles ]
Bradley rogers.

39:07.700 --> 39:10.700
Mm-hmm.
You did everything you could.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.400
It just didn't
Go our way.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.800
Thanks.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.300
And you got the consent.

39:17.300 --> 39:18.800
You're right.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.200
Mm-hmm, so let it go.

39:23.500 --> 39:28.400
* ah *

39:29.900 --> 39:33.900
* hold me, love *

39:34.300 --> 39:38.100
* i can't sleep again *

39:38.100 --> 39:42.100
* i have to kiss your lips *

39:42.200 --> 39:48.600
* i want to lay here
Next to him, love *

39:50.000 --> 39:53.900
* i remember *

39:53.900 --> 39:57.800
* walking in the rain *

39:57.800 --> 40:01.800
* rain was falling on my hands *

40:01.900 --> 40:07.800
* i don't want to live
Through that again, no *

40:10.200 --> 40:13.100
* outside *

40:13.100 --> 40:17.700
* it hardly gets dark now *

40:17.700 --> 40:21.300
* lovers walking
In the park now *

40:21.300 --> 40:23.500
* children singing songs *

40:23.500 --> 40:28.400
* of when they'll make
All their dreams come true *

40:29.100 --> 40:30.700
My daughter --

40:30.700 --> 40:33.000
She's 14 years old now,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.700
And i can't stop thinking of her
As 6, you know?

40:38.200 --> 40:41.500
Seems like
She was just that age.

40:41.500 --> 40:44.000
Everything i said
Was funny.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Always on my shoulders.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
Always wanted me
To play with her.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.300
She's not 6 anymore.

40:54.300 --> 40:58.000
And that's good.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.100
I kind of miss that time,
You know?

41:00.100 --> 41:02.500
Talking to yourself?

41:02.500 --> 41:05.800
Yeah.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.500
Listen, if i did the wrong thing
Yesterday --

41:07.500 --> 41:11.500
Thea tells me you tied the
Rope swing and went swimming.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.700
Yeah.

41:14.700 --> 41:16.800
Good for you.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.400
You think?

41:18.400 --> 41:20.800
How long has it been
Since you took a day off?

41:22.600 --> 41:25.300
22 years.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.600
Good for you.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.600
There's
So many people here.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.000
All those cards
And balloons.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.300
Yeah.

41:35.300 --> 41:41.500
* i would see you walking
In your coat, oh *

41:42.200 --> 41:45.600
You knew all
Of them, huh?

41:45.600 --> 41:48.400
Most of them.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.000
There are a lot.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
Not nearly enough.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.800
Who is your balloon for,
Dad?

41:56.800 --> 41:58.900
It's just a balloon.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.600
Where's yours?

42:05.600 --> 42:07.100
I don't have one.

42:07.100 --> 42:08.500
Why not?

42:08.500 --> 42:12.100
They're all your mother's,
Thea.

42:12.100 --> 42:13.200
Really?

42:15.600 --> 42:19.200
Guess i do kind of think of them
As all my own.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.400
But you go ahead,
Sweetie.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.300
Go ahead
And let yours fly.

42:30.600 --> 42:34.300
* i'll see you through it all *

42:34.300 --> 42:40.800
* just give me time
To learn to crawl *

42:41.800 --> 42:45.600
* just give me many chances *

42:45.600 --> 42:49.200
* i'll see you through it all *

42:49.200 --> 42:56.100
* just give me time
To learn to crawl *

42:57.000 --> 43:01.200
* just give me many chances *

43:01.200 --> 43:04.500
* i'll see you through it all *

43:04.500 --> 43:09.800
* just give me time
To learn to crawl *
