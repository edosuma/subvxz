WEBVTT

00:06.172 --> 00:08.258
I'm telling you, Vince walking
in right when you're about

00:08.341 --> 00:09.634
to tell Henry you love him,
weird.

00:09.718 --> 00:12.470
It was weird. It's weird
every time I see Vince.

00:13.596 --> 00:15.432
- Is it weird now?
- No. Why?

00:15.515 --> 00:17.392
- Hey.
- Hey..

00:17.475 --> 00:19.144
Hey, can you guys sit
somewhere else?

00:19.227 --> 00:21.146
Holly and I are kind of in
the middle of something weird.

00:21.229 --> 00:24.274
Fine, we've got some weird stuff
to talk about too.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.692
Hey, man,
you think it would be weird

00:25.775 --> 00:27.569
for a dog to marry a bird?

00:28.820 --> 00:31.197
So the thing is
Henry and I are so good

00:31.281 --> 00:32.448
together when we're alone

00:32.531 --> 00:34.117
but when Vince is around

00:34.200 --> 00:36.035
it's...really weird.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.746
Must be really weird
when Henry and Vince

00:37.829 --> 00:38.872
are in the same room.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.707
It's the weirdest.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.375
- Is it weird now?
- No. Why?

00:42.459 --> 00:44.002
Hey.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.920
Quit doing that.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.172
How's it going?

00:47.255 --> 00:49.299
- Not good.
- Why? What's the matter?

00:49.382 --> 00:51.176
I just got into a huge fight
with my dad.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.302
What about?

00:52.385 --> 00:53.595
I tell him that I'm thinking

00:53.678 --> 00:55.305
just thinking about
going to Columbia

00:55.388 --> 00:57.932
instead of his precious
Princeton, and he freaks.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.476
Whoa, when did that happen?

00:59.559 --> 01:01.311
I thought that you were
definitely going to Princeton.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.062
I don't want to be away from you

01:03.146 --> 01:05.482
and if my dad can't handle me
going to Columbia

01:05.565 --> 01:06.816
it's too damn bad

01:06.900 --> 01:07.984
and that's what I told him.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.486
Wow, you said that to your dad?

01:09.569 --> 01:11.154
Yeah, and he gave me that

01:11.237 --> 01:13.656
"As long as you live
under my roof" crap.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.950
So you know what?
I'm not living under his roof.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.660
So then where are you
going to live?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.996
I don't care. I'll find a place.
I'm not going back there.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.998
You can crash with me
until you find something.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.917
No, he can't.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.794
I, I-I just mean that

01:25.877 --> 01:27.003
don't you have a roommate?

01:27.086 --> 01:28.421
He's in LA for three weeks.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.840
Yeah, but he could
come back unexpectedly.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.509
I mean, come on, it's LA.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.178
Their governor
is a robot from the future.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.141
Or, you know,
he could love it.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.977
How perfect is this?

01:43.061 --> 01:45.772
It's...quite a situation.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.774
Now come on. Let's go get you
a key made and head on over.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.692
Okay, yeah.
I'll-I'll call you later.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.070
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.205
So now Henry
and his dad are in

02:44.289 --> 02:45.790
such a huge fight
that he moved out

02:45.874 --> 02:48.459
and guess who he's staying with
...Vince.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.711
- That sucks.
- Get out.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.921
Yeah, I know
and now they're making

02:52.005 --> 02:53.464
this big dinner
for everybody tonight

02:53.548 --> 02:55.341
and how uncomfortable
is that going to be?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.844
- Mm.
- You must feel horrible.

02:57.927 --> 03:01.389
- I do.
- No, I mean Val.

03:01.472 --> 03:02.765
Yeah, your sister's
got two boyfriends

03:02.849 --> 03:04.684
and you have none.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.769
And do you want to know
why you have none?

03:06.853 --> 03:08.271
Because you won't admit
that you and Peter

03:08.354 --> 03:09.606
are supposed to be together!

03:09.689 --> 03:10.940
- Yuck.
- Okay.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.442
- Holly, will you tell her?
- Yeah, well--

03:12.525 --> 03:14.360
What are the odds?

03:14.444 --> 03:17.113
He shows up in the same city,
in the same hotel

03:17.196 --> 03:18.948
in the room
right next door to you.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.618
- It was coincidence.
- It was fate.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.119
- Will you tell her, Holly?
- Yeah, I--

03:23.202 --> 03:26.372
You and Peter are just
so meant to be together.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.625
Otherwise, you would not have
kissed him, right?

03:28.708 --> 03:30.084
Right! Ha!

03:31.377 --> 03:32.962
Okay, I did not kiss him.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.422
He kissed me.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.549
For 14 seconds?

03:37.258 --> 03:39.010
Confidential.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.345
[knock on door]

03:43.264 --> 03:45.099
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.728
Ow!

03:49.771 --> 03:51.147
That was really nice of you

03:51.230 --> 03:53.232
letting Henry crash with you.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.484
He's a good guy.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.735
Yeah, you know,
he is a good guy.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.946
He's a good boyfriend,
he's a good person.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.448
He's really fantastic
at everything.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.408
This box is heavy.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.535
Sorry. Go ahead.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.454
- What is it?
- It's for Val.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.705
- Ooh, for me?
- Yep.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.998
From who?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.541
Here's the card.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.128
- It's from Peter.
- Huh!

04:14.212 --> 04:15.463
Ow!

04:17.089 --> 04:20.093
"I hope you enjoyed Chicago
as much as I did."

04:20.176 --> 04:22.679
Mm.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.682
Oh, Chicago-style pizza.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.893
Kielbasa?

04:28.977 --> 04:30.311
A Cubs baseball cap?

04:30.395 --> 04:34.148
Oh, that is the most romantic
thing I've ever seen.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.650
Kielbasa!

04:37.402 --> 04:38.403
Hey, I'm heading back there.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.779
Anything you want me
to tell Peter?

04:39.862 --> 04:40.822
Oh, no.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.032
Just tell him I said thank you.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.535
Any...anything else?

04:45.618 --> 04:48.204
No, unh-unh.
Just thank you.

04:48.287 --> 04:49.539
That's it?

04:50.581 --> 04:52.208
That's all I get,
thank you?

04:52.291 --> 04:53.751
What,
you were standing out there

04:53.835 --> 04:55.086
waiting to see what I would say?

04:55.169 --> 04:57.046
Yeah. Yeah, and I got
to tell you

04:57.130 --> 04:59.132
I'm a little disappointed.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.217
I mean, I was really hoping
for something like

05:01.300 --> 05:02.468
"Oh, he's so sweet"

05:02.552 --> 05:03.886
or "How thoughtful"

05:03.970 --> 05:06.514
or "I can't wait
to kiss him again."

05:06.597 --> 05:09.809
Ow! Seriously,
don't do that again.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.979
Okay, that kiss,
it was an accident, alright?

05:13.062 --> 05:15.690
It was not supposed to happen
so just forget about it.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.734
You loved it, I bet
you came back here

05:17.817 --> 05:19.068
and told those two
all about it.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.737
I did not.

05:20.820 --> 05:21.988
You two kissed?

05:22.071 --> 05:24.991
And...it lasted 14 seconds?

05:34.125 --> 05:37.545
I just don't understand why
you kicked Peter to the curb.

05:37.628 --> 05:40.548
- Stapler, please.
- Just tell me why!

05:40.631 --> 05:42.884
Because I need to put these
two pieces of paper together

05:42.967 --> 05:45.595
in a permanent-type fashion.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.556
But he likes you so much,
and I know you like him.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.433
Yes, I do.
I like him a lot, okay?

05:50.516 --> 05:53.436
And that is the problem.
Now give me the damn stapler.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.104
What is the problem?

05:56.230 --> 05:58.149
When we were in Chicago,
he told me

05:58.232 --> 05:59.984
to my face
how much he hates commitment.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.736
That is exactly what I
went through with Jeff.

06:01.819 --> 06:02.945
Why would I do that again?

06:03.029 --> 06:05.615
Because you haven't
had sex in a year.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.035
- Hi.
- Wow.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.369
Who are you dressing for?

06:10.453 --> 06:13.372
Your boyfriend
or your <i> boyfriend?</i>

06:13.456 --> 06:16.000
Shut up!
Henry is my boyfriend.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.585
Hm, Val doesn't
have a boyfriend.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.879
Shut up!

06:19.962 --> 06:21.422
Hey, Holly, do you believe

06:21.506 --> 06:23.800
Val running into Peter
in Chicago was fate?

06:23.883 --> 06:24.967
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.844
Do you believe Val
kissing Peter was fate?

06:26.928 --> 06:29.305
No, that was her
not having had sex for a year.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.599
Night.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.852
So you're telling me that you
don't believe in fate, ever.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.145
No. Mm-mm. No fate.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.273
Okay, come here.
Then how do you explain this?

06:40.566 --> 06:42.527
That is a speed-dating website.

06:42.610 --> 06:43.861
Exactly!

06:43.945 --> 06:46.155
You were supposed to be
making me a spreadsheet.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.658
Which is fate.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.951
If you had hired someone

06:50.034 --> 06:51.452
who knew how to do
a spreadsheet

06:51.536 --> 06:53.746
she never would have
found this website.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.790
It's fate.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.375
You don't know
how to make a spreadsheet?

06:57.458 --> 07:00.419
I don't even know
what it is.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.424
But...may I remind you
that you hired me

07:05.508 --> 07:06.425
because I'm pushy

07:06.509 --> 07:07.593
I don't take crap from clients

07:07.677 --> 07:09.387
and I'm a people person.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.973
That's true.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.267
Okay, look, you don't
have to go out with Peter

07:14.350 --> 07:15.560
but you got to meet someone.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.019
Not like that.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.313
That is so not me.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.356
Okay, fine.

07:20.439 --> 07:23.192
But if you don't go,
I don't go.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.153
Eventually,
Holly will move out.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.529
I'll take her room

07:26.612 --> 07:29.282
and then it's you and me
together

07:29.365 --> 07:32.451
now and every New Year's Eve.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.539
I'll get our coats.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.627
[knock on door]

07:41.711 --> 07:43.754
(Gary)
Coming.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.798
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.467
- Oh, cool place.
- We brought cake.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.677
Oh, what smells so good?

07:49.760 --> 07:52.054
- Ah, that's Vince's tortellini.
- Ooh.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.556
Why don't you, uh, two sit down

07:53.639 --> 07:54.724
and I'll get you
something to drink.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.434
Yeah, here,
let me take your coats.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.728
- Holly. Tina.
- Thank you.

07:58.811 --> 07:59.854
Welcome.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.650
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.820
I'm actually doing a lot better
than I thought.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.239
- How about now?
- I've had a setback.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.492
- Hey, girls.
- Hey.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.785
You paint?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.078
Yeah, I fool around with it.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.955
It kind of helps me relax.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.248
'How's, uh,
how's my tortellini?'

08:19.332 --> 08:21.751
Oh, it smells great.
Is it done yet?

08:21.834 --> 08:23.336
Let's see.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.214
- Got it?
- Hmm.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.257
Here, Tina, try this.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.886
Mm. That's amazing.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.179
Alright.

08:33.261 --> 08:35.514
- Holly?
- Oh. Ha-ha. I'll just..

08:35.597 --> 08:36.933
Oh! Aa-ah!

08:37.015 --> 08:38.934
- Alright?
- It's okay.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.187
Hey, Tina,
look at that huge TV.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.438
Let's go and see
if it's bigger than you.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.776
I have to get Henry
and get out of here.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.110
This is way too uncomfortable.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.445
I know. Look at him.

08:49.528 --> 08:51.322
He looks unbelievable
in that shirt.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.282
And now you find out
he cooks, he paints.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.035
- How sexy is that?
- This is helpful.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.912
Look, I need to be alone
with Henry right now.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.748
Um, I'll come back
and pick you up later, okay?

09:00.831 --> 09:03.376
- Oh, who plays guitar?
- Oh, I do.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.336
Oh, I got to go.

09:11.676 --> 09:15.388
No, no, uh-uh. I'm not into,
you know, superficial stuff.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.932
A guy doesn't
have to be, uh, tall

09:18.015 --> 09:19.225
doesn't have to be all muscular

09:19.308 --> 09:21.560
doesn't have to have
a ton of hair.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.274
Does he have to have
a personality?

09:26.983 --> 09:27.942
[bell dings]

09:28.025 --> 09:29.568
Okay, that's three minutes.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.988
Gentlemen, please
move to another table.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.699
I hate you.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.201
Do you hate me now?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.540
Hi, little guy.

09:43.916 --> 09:47.169
- Hi, I'm Val.
- You have an incredible body.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.548
Look, I know
we've been instructed

09:50.631 --> 09:52.341
not to say
what we do for a living

09:52.425 --> 09:55.594
but, uh, I just sold
a little pipe company

09:55.678 --> 10:02.560
and I'm worth
8,600,000 buckaroonies.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.520
Ding. Oops!

10:04.603 --> 10:06.355
Time's up.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.482
So what do you do for fun?

10:08.566 --> 10:10.401
I collect butterflies.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.779
I'm a lesbian.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.701
- Making a getaway?
- Oh, big time.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.537
I'm right behind you.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.206
Hey, did I talk to you?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.709
No, you definitely
didn't talk to me.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.170
Isn't this the most incredibly

10:29.253 --> 10:30.463
horrible thing
you've been through?

10:30.546 --> 10:32.131
I know.
The whole process is stupid.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.550
How can you even get to know
someone in three minutes?

10:34.633 --> 10:36.218
I proposed to my wife
after six weeks

10:36.302 --> 10:38.763
but this is ridiculous.

10:38.846 --> 10:43.100
You have a wife? Because I think
that might be against the rules.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.895
No, no, I, I lost
my wife two years ago

10:45.978 --> 10:47.772
which is the reason
my friend's been pushing me

10:47.855 --> 10:49.148
to come to one of these things.

10:49.231 --> 10:52.193
Oh, I'm sorry about your wife.

10:52.276 --> 10:55.446
Thanks, I don't usually
drop that on people so fast

10:55.529 --> 10:59.658
but I'm still in that spill your
guts in three minutes rhythm.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.078
Yeah, I went out
with a guy for a year

11:02.161 --> 11:03.746
he told me he didn't
want a commitment, we broke up

11:03.829 --> 11:05.664
I don't like
onions on my pizza.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.124
Ding.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.920
- I'm Jack.
- I'm Val.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.755
It's really nice to meet you.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.675
You're the first normal person
I've met all night.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.929
That one over there,
the, uh, Olympic skater?

11:24.225 --> 11:26.644
Yeah, she's a little nuts.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.106
Yeah.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.533
Okay, let's check
how many responses I got.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.868
Already? We just
left 20 minutes ago.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.621
Ha. There's a reason
it's called speed dating.

11:45.704 --> 11:49.041
Those people are desperate.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.627
Lauren,
you're one of those people.

11:51.710 --> 11:55.089
I did not go there to meet men.
I went there for you.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.800
I really don't even care.
Oh, my God! I got one!

11:57.883 --> 11:59.802
I got one!

11:59.885 --> 12:01.971
I'm getting married!

12:03.180 --> 12:04.723
Which one is it?

12:04.807 --> 12:07.852
Russell. Russell. Russell.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.145
Oh, I remember.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.479
He's the tall, red-headed guy

12:10.563 --> 12:12.231
who's the sports fanatic.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.984
- You hate sports.
- No, it's okay.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.069
I-I'm going to change him.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.656
Okay, let's see
if you're getting married.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.241
Hey, how are you getting
into my e-mail?

12:22.324 --> 12:24.535
- You don't know my password.
- Ooh, your birthday.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.036
I cracked the code.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.875
Oh, my God!
You got one, too.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.835
I did? Oh, no, no.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.504
It's not that short guy
with the curly hair

12:35.588 --> 12:37.173
and the boogie, is it?

12:40.050 --> 12:41.677
You know,
I wouldn't write him off.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.471
It's probably gone by now.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.848
No, it's from Jack

12:45.931 --> 12:47.683
the guy you weren't
even supposed to meet.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.186
Do you see
what I'm saying about fate?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.021
Ooh, look, he wants to
meet you tomorrow morning

12:52.104 --> 12:53.439
for coffee
at Dean &amp; Deluca's!

12:53.522 --> 12:56.650
Ooh, let's see that.
Oh, that is so sweet.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.528
Aw, your first date
with your new boyfriend.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.697
- I-I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.033
This guy will obviously commit,
okay?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.035
He was married,
and he didn't break it off.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.037
She crapped out on him.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.589
[laughing]

13:18.672 --> 13:20.257
- Hey, where'd everybody go?
- I don't know.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.717
But it looks like
they saved us some cake.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.219
Oh, yeah.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.723
Hey, I'm sorry I made us miss
your dinner. You worked so hard.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.226
No, no, that was
a great idea you had.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.186
I think we needed
to spend some time alone.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.438
I mean, when was
the last time we did that?

13:34.522 --> 13:37.358
It seems like there's
always somebody else around

13:37.441 --> 13:38.567
I know.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.152
I like when we do this,
you know?

13:40.236 --> 13:44.073
When it's just you and me,
everything's, like..

13:44.156 --> 13:45.574
- Like what?
- I don't know.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.118
- It's just better.
- Yeah.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.913
[woman giggling]

13:50.996 --> 13:53.415
Sounds like Vince
has some company.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.629
- Oh, my God.
- What?

14:02.675 --> 14:04.385
Tina's bag.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.389
Vince and Tina hooked up?

14:08.472 --> 14:10.933
That's awesome.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.060
Isn't that awesome?

14:19.942 --> 14:22.194
[instrumental music]

14:26.699 --> 14:29.076
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.536
Ooh, I love your new desk.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.788
Really? Wanna make out with it?

14:32.871 --> 14:34.164
[chuckles]
What?

14:34.248 --> 14:35.457
No, I just know
how much you like making out

14:35.541 --> 14:36.500
with everything regardless of

14:36.584 --> 14:38.419
how it makes your friends feel.

14:38.502 --> 14:39.461
What are you talking about?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.380
- You and Vince.
- What?

14:41.463 --> 14:43.507
Henry and I came back,
and we heard you guys.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.800
You know, it's like
my friendship

14:44.883 --> 14:46.093
means nothing to you.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.303
Are you insane?

14:47.386 --> 14:49.013
How would you like it
if I did that to you?

14:49.096 --> 14:50.014
Did what?

14:50.097 --> 14:51.056
Whatever you and Vince

14:51.140 --> 14:52.224
were doing in his bedroom.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.559
- We were painting.
- Huh?

14:53.642 --> 14:54.727
He was showing me how to paint.

14:54.810 --> 14:55.978
What is wrong with you?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.688
- You were just painting?
- Yes!

14:57.771 --> 14:59.565
Yeah, that's what I told Henry.
Hey, you hungry?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.025
No, no, no, get back here.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.651
You, you thought
I was with Vince?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.987
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I-I was wrong. It's no biggie.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.405
Oh, no, it's a hugie.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.615
I mean, first of all
I would never do

15:07.698 --> 15:08.699
something like that to you.

15:08.782 --> 15:09.992
And second of all,
don't you think

15:10.075 --> 15:11.410
it's a little weird
that you're getting all

15:11.493 --> 15:12.828
freaked out
about me and a guy

15:12.911 --> 15:14.079
who is not even your boyfriend?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.498
Okay, I said I'm sorry.
It's over.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.083
No, you see, it's not over

15:18.167 --> 15:20.502
and it's not going to be over
until you get your act together

15:20.586 --> 15:23.005
and figure out
what the hell it is you want.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.089
Ugh.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.348
I got stood up!

15:32.431 --> 15:35.392
What? That is not possible.
He loves you.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.519
Yeah, apparently, not so much.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.813
Okay, well, maybe
he left you an e-mail.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.357
Your sister's insane!

15:41.440 --> 15:43.609
Yeah, well, I haven't
had sex in a year!

15:46.737 --> 15:48.614
Nothing. Damn.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.366
You know, something is wrong

15:50.449 --> 15:53.035
because you are not
the stood-up type.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.912
I'll bet you've never been
stood up in your whole life

15:54.995 --> 15:56.497
have you?

15:56.580 --> 15:57.539
No.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.208
I hate you.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.460
Okay, look, obviously
something happened to him.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.337
Maybe we should
check the hospitals.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.589
I did.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.383
It's all falling apart.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.717
- What?
- My life.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.011
Last night, Henry and I left
Vince's for a while

16:11.095 --> 16:13.222
and when we came back Tina
and Vince were in his bedroom

16:13.305 --> 16:15.224
and I accused her
of doing stuff with him.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.060
- Tina was with Vince?
- Yeah, but they were painting.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.020
- Each other?
- No.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.897
Now, I have to go meet Henry
and convince him

16:21.980 --> 16:24.233
to move out of Vince's.
Otherwise, my life is over.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.485
- Well, Holly, wait.
- I have to go. Bye.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.405
You know what?
Maybe I should go after her.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.615
No, look, she's got
two boyfriends, okay?

16:31.699 --> 16:33.659
You're too pretty to be alone.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.577
Look, I promise,
she's going to be fine, okay?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.162
But we got to find Jack.
Where does he work?

16:37.246 --> 16:39.540
I don't know. We only talked
for, like, 15 minutes.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.625
Okay, well, what did he say?
He must have said something.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.211
I don't know,
uh, he likes kids

16:44.294 --> 16:46.714
he lives alone, and he goes
to the batting cages.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.257
- Let's go.
- Where?

16:48.340 --> 16:49.591
The batting cages.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.802
No, we are not going
to the batting cages.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.721
Uh-uh.
I'm not chasing after him.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.014
Besides, there's, like, a one in
a million chance he'll be there.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.434
Well, that's right,
and if your true love is there

16:58.517 --> 17:00.310
then you'll know it was fate.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.603
And if he's not?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.772
They have bumper cars.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.942
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:13.531 --> 17:16.326
So I was thinking about
you and your dad

17:16.410 --> 17:18.619
and how great
your relationship is.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.457
Actually, he's distant
and unemotional.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.210
Which is why you have to work
even harder.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.796
So that's why I think
that you need to move

17:27.880 --> 17:30.299
back home...tonight.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.844
- What's going on?
- Nothing, nothing.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.512
I mean, if you want to
go to Columbia, fine.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.097
If you want to
go to Princeton, fine

17:37.181 --> 17:39.016
but I think
that's a decision

17:39.099 --> 17:41.977
you should make
at your parents' apartment.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.896
Okay, you're obviously
not telling me something.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.857
I don't know what it is, but
when you're ready to tell me

17:46.940 --> 17:48.067
call me.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.320
At your parents' apartment?

18:02.581 --> 18:05.417
Lauren, I'm leaving. We have
looked in every batting cage.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.835
No, but people
are coming and going.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.128
Let's just make one more round.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.963
This is ridiculous, I'm going..

18:10.047 --> 18:11.924
Wait a second.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.717
I think that's him.
That could be him.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.469
- Oh, I knew it!
- Wait, no, no, no.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.012
I, I'm not positive.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.263
Well, I am.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.517
That man whose butt
looks so magnificently

18:21.600 --> 18:23.477
tight in those jeans
is your soul mate.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.728
Now come on. You go.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.688
W-wait, no, no.
He stood me up.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.233
Maybe he...doesn't want
to see me.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.527
Okay, listen,
did you ever think that maybe

18:31.610 --> 18:33.529
you're the first person
he's had feelings for

18:33.612 --> 18:36.365
since his wife
took a dirt nap?

18:36.448 --> 18:38.242
And maybe he's just so nervous

18:38.325 --> 18:40.536
that it's too much to handle.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.912
Okay, I'm going in.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.456
Okay, you go get 'em, tiger.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.125
Very firm.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.669
Thanks.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.672
Excuse me.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.468
- Peter?
- Hey.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.054
Holy crap!

18:59.137 --> 19:02.558
- What are you doing here?
- Ah, what are you doing here?

19:02.641 --> 19:04.393
Batting balls.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.728
Huh, so you tracked me
down again, didn't you?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.313
No, no, unh.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.898
I'm here to see someone else.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.067
This is just a weird
coincidence, is what it is.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.111
It's a coincidence,
I tell you.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.030
You know what?

19:17.114 --> 19:19.449
I can't play these games
with you anymore.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.746
Listen, Val

19:24.830 --> 19:26.039
I'm crazy about you

19:26.123 --> 19:29.167
and I think
you feel the same way.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.378
I'm going to Italy
tomorrow morning.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.589
I'll be back
at the end of the month.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.091
And when I come back,
I'm going to call you

19:36.174 --> 19:39.136
and I'm going to ask
if we're worth taking a shot.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.981
Because I think we are.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.027
Now get out of the cage.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.029
These balls come through here
at about 85 miles an hour

19:57.112 --> 19:58.655
and I don't want to lose you.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.332
Now can we go
on the bumper cars?

20:08.415 --> 20:09.541
Yeah.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.218
Hey, hey.
What took you so long?

20:20.302 --> 20:21.595
I thought
you were all perceptive.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.805
Didn't you hear the pain
in my voice?

20:25.223 --> 20:27.809
- I ordered you a Turkey burger.
- Great. What happened?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.645
Okay, well Henry
won't move out

20:29.728 --> 20:31.313
and he thinks that something
is going on with me

20:31.396 --> 20:32.981
because something
is going on with me

20:33.065 --> 20:34.483
and I don't know
what to do anymore.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.735
Henry, Vince,
Henry, Vince, aah!

20:36.818 --> 20:38.904
- Help me fix it.
- Okay, calm down.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.490
Listen to me, okay?

20:41.573 --> 20:44.910
You're just..

20:44.993 --> 20:47.329
...going through a thing, hm?

20:47.412 --> 20:49.748
And-and it's hard.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.125
- Huh?
- Yeah, I know.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.378
Look, I feel really bad for you

20:54.461 --> 20:56.546
but, um, maybe I'm not
the perfect person

20:56.630 --> 21:00.133
to advise you right now,
because the truth is, um..

21:00.217 --> 21:02.803
...I'm kind of
screwed up myself.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.263
Aw, but what am I going to do?

21:05.347 --> 21:06.556
Okay, unfortunately

21:06.640 --> 21:07.933
you're going to have
to make a decision.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.018
I mean, you cannot keep
stringing Henry along

21:10.102 --> 21:11.395
if you're having these
feelings for Vince.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.897
- It's just not fair.
- What?

21:17.943 --> 21:20.195
I ordered you a Turkey burger.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.703
