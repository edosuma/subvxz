00:51.426 --> 00:52.427
Chet-chet!

00:59.518 --> 01:00.602
Chet-chet-chet!

03:48.937 --> 03:51.106
Please cry. Please be alive.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.930
Hey! No!

04:23.388 --> 04:25.849
Hey! Hey, face me!

04:25.933 --> 04:28.519
Hey! Look at me!

04:30.521 --> 04:31.563
Look at m--

04:33.774 --> 04:36.735
Hey, face me!

04:37.694 --> 04:38.820
Face me!

05:22.322 --> 05:25.117
Who's there? Answer me. Who's there?

05:25.534 --> 05:27.369
I see my children are in good hands.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.747
Jerlamarel...

05:32.708 --> 05:33.709
is that you?

05:40.966 --> 05:42.092
Yes.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.140
Did you come to take them away?

05:48.223 --> 05:50.559
No. I'm a fugitive.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.561
And I have work to do elsewhere.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.813
They are safer with you as they grow.

05:57.649 --> 06:01.737
I stayed close to make sure
that you would find the sanctuary.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.324
And to kill the bears in the valley.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.035
I believe this is the last bear.

06:18.462 --> 06:19.796
These children are a gift.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.299
Take great care of them as they grow.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.470
May I have your hand?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.062
What is... what is this?

06:35.979 --> 06:39.066
At the sanctuary, beside the waterfall,
there is a small cave.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.735
Climb in it. There you will find a box.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.196
I've given you the key to open that box.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.657
Speak to Paris.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.952
Tell her that the contents of the box
are for my children.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.163
Open the box when they are 12 summers old.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.249
Old enough to understand what is inside.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.458
What is inside?

06:59.127 --> 07:00.128
Knowledge.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.215
Knowledge that will begin a new world.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.218
Better even than the world
of our ancestors.

07:14.059 --> 07:17.271
Someday, we will be together.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.537
Name them Haniwa and Kofun.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.956
That way I'll know them
when they come to me.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.376
And when will they come to you?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.044
The answers are all in the box.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.463
Wait. Jerlamarel.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.093
Jerlamarel!

07:51.805 --> 07:52.848
Jerlamarel.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.021
Jerlamarel!

08:21.835 --> 08:26.298
I just heard Baba Voss
calling the witch's name.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.097
Does this not bother you?

08:36.183 --> 08:40.479
-Is there no law in this place?
-We are far away from the law here.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.316
Baba Voss is in charge now.
We dare not offend him.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.151
Baba Voss is not the law.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.112
God is the law.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.448
Perhaps we are far away from God here too.

08:51.532 --> 08:56.578
It was Baba Voss and it was Paris
who condemned my mother...

08:57.704 --> 09:02.042
your own sister, to the bonfire.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.335
For what?

09:03.794 --> 09:08.131
Because she questioned the wisdom
of letting a man like him,

09:08.215 --> 09:11.969
a stranger, who would not speak of
his past, to be in charge of the village?

09:13.846 --> 09:18.976
They burned her because they feared
she spoke the truth.

09:20.352 --> 09:24.648
God doesn't lose sight of those things.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.652
And even if he did...

09:30.946 --> 09:32.489
I never will.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.541
Where have you been?

09:45.586 --> 09:46.712
Baba Voss?

09:50.674 --> 09:51.675
What happened?

09:53.635 --> 09:54.970
Only the truth.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.307
Sit down, my love.

09:58.724 --> 09:59.766
Why?

10:01.310 --> 10:04.563
Because Jerlamarel... happened.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.115
It says we'll find her
at the end of the fallen trunk.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.380
I've only ever heard stories.

11:54.298 --> 11:57.217
I didn't even know that we had a Shadow
living among us in the village.

11:57.301 --> 12:00.179
That's why Shadows are Shadows.
No one knows who they are.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.389
But the Alkenny have always had a Shadow.

12:03.348 --> 12:06.810
I left a note on the altar for her,
and when I came back, it was gone.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.562
She will be here.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.106
And how will you know when it arrives?

12:11.690 --> 12:14.276
I don't know. I've never done this before.

12:14.735 --> 12:18.071
I presume she will make herself
known to us.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.824
Why do you keep saying "she"?

12:20.908 --> 12:24.244
Because Shadows are always women.
Men are too clumsy.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.163
So who do you think it is, then?

12:26.914 --> 12:29.166
Somebody we probably talk to every day.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.794
Somebody with the power to hide her body.

12:33.212 --> 12:36.298
No one can both be
and then not be all at once.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.551
She moves only when others move.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.428
Even Ayuras can't hear her.

12:41.970 --> 12:45.807
She purges herself of thought.
Even presages can't sense her.

12:45.891 --> 12:49.436
She's in another place, undetectable.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.731
Even dogs think they're stone.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.279
She is here.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.659
Shadow...

13:04.952 --> 13:06.161
I greet you.

13:12.584 --> 13:17.381
Shadow, I need you to shadow someone,
someone in the village,

13:17.464 --> 13:19.174
and report everything you hear.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.888
She will not respond unless you submit.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.641
Stand still!

13:33.021 --> 13:35.732
Shadow, will you do as I ask?

13:41.029 --> 13:42.030
Is that a yes?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.868
Two for "yes," one for "no"? Yes?

13:49.830 --> 13:53.417
Shadow, the person is Paris.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.670
We believe she is a witch. We need proof.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.338
Can you shadow a witch?

14:06.180 --> 14:08.265
Shadow, can you shadow a witch?

14:20.652 --> 14:22.196
And how shall we pay you?

14:26.325 --> 14:27.534
Shadow?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.131
"A new world," he said?

14:44.009 --> 14:47.054
Perhaps in making a new world,
the old will be destroyed.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.265
It's just a box, my love.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.571
What is it?

15:06.073 --> 15:09.159
It's for the children.
Perhaps it is a toy.

15:10.244 --> 15:12.955
No. It will have a meaning.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.374
Everything he does has a meaning.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.002
Meaning of which I can never understand.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.797
I'm good for caring,
not good for understanding.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.384
Baba Voss, I would always choose a man
who can care of me

15:25.467 --> 15:27.761
over a man who understands me.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.099
Paris?

15:32.182 --> 15:33.308
Yes.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.769
Your husband invited me.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.689
Jerlamarel himself said
we must consult with her.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.109
Come, come.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.242
What else is in the box?

16:02.296 --> 16:06.842
This message says
we must keep what is on top on top,

16:07.301 --> 16:10.137
and what is at the bottom on the bottom.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.402
How do we make a new world of tree bark?

16:28.197 --> 16:30.115
The breeze brings no visions either.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.576
And many more of the same.

16:33.827 --> 16:34.828
Paris.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.375
What? Do you know what they are?

16:42.085 --> 16:43.086
Yes.

16:45.172 --> 16:48.926
They... they are books.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.012
What are books?

16:52.095 --> 16:57.351
My grandmother told me stories
her grandmother's grandmother told her.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.771
I dreamt them with her.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.569
Books are in the holy shape.

17:08.862 --> 17:14.910
They are silent, and yet
they speak directly into the imagination.

17:15.867 --> 17:20.499
You can burn them,
but they are more powerful than fire.

17:21.165 --> 17:25.462
All the knowledge of the ancient ones
are put into them.

17:25.796 --> 17:29.675
Secrets of the age of vision.

17:30.884 --> 17:35.430
My grandmother's grandmother
had books of her own.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.267
But the Witchfinder burnt them all.

17:39.268 --> 17:43.647
I thought all the books had been burnt.

17:44.189 --> 17:46.400
Jerlamarel said
that we must wait 12 summers

17:46.483 --> 17:47.818
before we give them to the children.

17:47.901 --> 17:52.531
He must believe that they have inherited
his ability to hear silence.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.325
He can believe,
but that does not make it true.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.619
My babies may not be cursed.

17:57.703 --> 17:58.871
Cursed?

17:58.954 --> 18:04.126
We're here, living alone forever,
in a village filled with superstition.

18:04.877 --> 18:07.379
Maybe your children won't stay forever.

18:08.297 --> 18:09.590
Meaning what?

18:10.257 --> 18:11.508
Meaning what, Paris?

18:11.592 --> 18:14.595
Until we know for certain
that they have the ability,

18:15.387 --> 18:17.431
there must be no dispute between us.

18:17.514 --> 18:21.018
We must bury them like precious seeds.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.980
Because they are a gift from Jerlamarel.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.358
And Jerlamarel's gifts are always good.

18:28.442 --> 18:30.485
You know different, Maghra?

18:33.405 --> 18:34.615
Baba Voss...

18:36.533 --> 18:38.911
bury the books by the hyacinth tree.

18:40.245 --> 18:44.374
And for 12 summers,
we will not speak a word of this.

18:53.842 --> 18:57.387
We are not alone.

19:22.913 --> 19:23.956
Shadow?

19:31.797 --> 19:33.006
Shadow.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.095
I got your message.

19:44.685 --> 19:45.894
I'm here.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.447
Are you there?

20:02.286 --> 20:03.495
Shadow?

20:16.717 --> 20:17.718
She wouldn't speak.

20:19.511 --> 20:20.888
She tied what she heard.

20:21.305 --> 20:25.642
There were three present.
Baba Voss, Paris, and Maghra.

20:26.143 --> 20:27.728
They spoke about the babies.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.021
What of the witch?

20:29.104 --> 20:30.105
The babies.

20:30.522 --> 20:34.067
They're wailing, they're feeding,
they're cooing, nothing else.

20:34.151 --> 20:35.485
This is what she said.

20:38.363 --> 20:39.656
The Shadow is lying!

20:39.740 --> 20:41.366
You may be right.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.952
She may not answer my questions.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.415
But I'm gonna send news of a witch.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.792
And then the Witchfinders can ask them--

20:50.876 --> 20:52.669
News? How are you going to send news?

20:59.009 --> 21:00.093
A message.

21:01.762 --> 21:05.140
It will flow downstream
through a dozen different valleys.

21:08.185 --> 21:09.686
Who knows who will find it?

21:09.770 --> 21:11.396
A beaver will find it.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.357
But I will do it twice a day.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.526
Three times a day.

21:15.609 --> 21:19.613
And one day, our prayers will be answered.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.908
There are so many valleys and rivers.
It will take years.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.201
Perhaps.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.085
But we will have hope.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.579
Hold!

22:21.258 --> 22:22.467
My friend.

22:23.719 --> 22:26.847
Knew I'd find you out here
all by yourself.

22:37.608 --> 22:38.984
How are things with you?

22:41.153 --> 22:42.404
All is well.

22:42.487 --> 22:43.488
Good.

22:45.282 --> 22:46.491
And you?

22:47.284 --> 22:49.369
Is all well with you too?

22:52.206 --> 22:53.624
Do you really wanna know?

22:54.166 --> 22:55.375
Of course.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.509
Things are, are not so good.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.262
I have trouble sleeping.

23:09.223 --> 23:10.390
I'm sorry to hear that.

23:10.474 --> 23:14.269
You see, I hear things during the day
that keep me awake.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.564
What sort of things?

23:17.648 --> 23:19.816
I feel a great mistrust around me.

23:20.734 --> 23:24.655
I fear someone may have even gone
to great lengths

23:24.738 --> 23:29.701
to spy upon me and those closest to me,
inside my own home.

23:32.913 --> 23:34.623
It is highly unlikely.

23:36.083 --> 23:40.546
It is no secret that you and your aunt
bear ill will towards me and my family.

23:40.629 --> 23:44.925
I thought if there was someone out there
with poor judgment to want to provoke me,

23:46.009 --> 23:48.095
you, of all people, might know them.

23:50.722 --> 23:53.600
But you don't, do you?

23:58.522 --> 24:00.774
No, I do not.

24:03.569 --> 24:05.863
Good. That's good.

24:08.031 --> 24:11.535
I want you to remember, I am the law here.

24:12.536 --> 24:17.124
Anyone and everyone can come to me
and speak their mind,

24:17.207 --> 24:20.169
and if they face me when they speak,

24:20.252 --> 24:24.047
they will meet a fair man, a just man.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.008
The man that I am right now.

24:27.009 --> 24:30.387
But if I hear whispers in the wind,

24:31.221 --> 24:34.141
and I must discover the speaker myself,

24:34.641 --> 24:39.313
then he or she may face the man
that I once was.

24:40.063 --> 24:46.320
A man with the taste for blood and terror.

24:53.702 --> 24:57.623
If someone has something to say,
please, Gether Bax,

24:57.706 --> 25:00.459
tell them to find me and say it...

25:03.128 --> 25:04.713
before I find them first.

25:34.451 --> 25:35.661
Hear me!

25:37.329 --> 25:42.376
You have failed to give me the information
I asked for.

25:45.045 --> 25:46.839
And you've lost your homes.

25:47.923 --> 25:51.885
Speak now so you may not lose your lives
as well.

25:53.637 --> 25:59.476
Tell me what you know about the heretic
and devil called Jerlamarel.

26:00.143 --> 26:03.856
Tell me what you know about his children.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.191
We... we hear nothing.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.694
Please, I beg you, let us be.

26:15.075 --> 26:20.414
If you've heard nothing,
then your ears are no use to me.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.103
Messenger!

26:46.940 --> 26:48.275
A report for the queen.

27:01.622 --> 27:05.709
"We have been searching in the mountains
of the Sun Grave land for months now.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.795
We pray to God always for guidance,

27:08.879 --> 27:13.175
but we get no word,
no scent, no markers, no hope.

27:14.551 --> 27:17.262
But the villages of the Sun Grave world
are scattered.

27:17.346 --> 27:19.890
There are many mountains
and lost plateaux.

27:20.349 --> 27:25.479
The people fear bears and lions
and remain inside their defenses.

27:27.064 --> 27:33.028
And, so, it is with heavy heart
that I now seek your instruction.

27:33.946 --> 27:35.030
Is my mission ended?

27:36.323 --> 27:38.200
I believe it is now hopeless.

27:38.951 --> 27:42.329
I humbly request
that we be allowed to return to Payan.

27:43.622 --> 27:47.334
I remain your devoted servant,
Tamacti Jun."

27:50.754 --> 27:52.256
May I read the message for myself?

27:52.339 --> 27:54.591
-I have read it to you in its entirety.
-Give it to me.

27:55.259 --> 27:58.470
I have very sensitive fingers.
You may have missed something.

28:21.702 --> 28:24.037
The first arm's length
is indeed from Tamacti Jun.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.624
The second arm's length is not.

28:28.458 --> 28:31.253
Tamacti Jun is never humble,
he's not a servant,

28:31.837 --> 28:33.922
and by secret agreement
between Tamacti and I,

28:34.006 --> 28:36.842
he always ties a heart every tenth
to avoid forgery,

28:36.925 --> 28:40.762
and this, my Holy Lord Sak, is a forgery.

28:40.846 --> 28:42.973
Others wrote it. You were sent. Kneel.

28:43.557 --> 28:45.475
-Your Majesty...
-I said kneel!

28:51.356 --> 28:55.736
Tamacti Jun is the royal tax collector
and the royal Witchfinder.

28:56.445 --> 29:00.032
He's commissioned to serve 20 summers,
and 20 summers he will serve.

29:00.699 --> 29:06.246
And every single day of his service,
he will hunt for Jerlamarel.

29:06.663 --> 29:13.462
For hatred and vengeance are
the two wild horses pulling his carriage.

29:14.838 --> 29:16.632
Who sent you to lie to me?

29:18.050 --> 29:20.594
Others with concerns.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.471
Which others?

29:23.514 --> 29:26.391
Others who wish to make you see reason,
Your Majesty.

29:27.976 --> 29:30.187
Your Majesty,
the heretic Jerlamarel is lost.

29:30.270 --> 29:31.605
We have troubles here.

29:32.022 --> 29:33.607
The holy power is fading.

29:34.107 --> 29:36.485
Water is coming through cracks
in the eternal wall,

29:36.944 --> 29:38.362
and the level is rising.

29:39.571 --> 29:42.658
The gods now only sing with two voices.

29:44.076 --> 29:46.828
People are questioning your power.

29:48.038 --> 29:50.499
You need your army here, Your Majesty.

29:55.504 --> 29:57.548
Who tied the false knots?

30:00.425 --> 30:01.635
Lord Carne.

30:02.553 --> 30:03.762
Lady Zee.

30:05.597 --> 30:06.807
And more?

30:08.225 --> 30:09.434
None.

30:17.526 --> 30:19.152
Choke on your own lies.

30:43.218 --> 30:44.511
I wish to pray.

31:16.460 --> 31:21.256
Jerlamarel, my one true love.

31:24.051 --> 31:26.011
Once, I prayed with you like this.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.100
Once, we spoke to each other
without words...

31:34.269 --> 31:36.480
but you no longer speak to me.

31:37.689 --> 31:39.691
So I'll speak to you in a prayer.

31:44.780 --> 31:49.034
Jerlamarel... come home in peace...

31:50.327 --> 31:52.496
and beat your pursuers to my body.

31:52.913 --> 31:54.414
I will forgive your sins.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.796
Come back and give me children
with the power, your power.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.424
I will proclaim the Vision heresy.

32:06.260 --> 32:07.928
I will renounce the gods.

32:11.014 --> 32:12.975
For our children will be the gods.

32:13.058 --> 32:16.520
And I will be the god you once denied.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.483
Forever and ever.

32:25.404 --> 32:26.572
Behold...

32:28.323 --> 32:31.785
Lord Carne and Lady Zee...

32:33.370 --> 32:35.414
whom I thought to be faithful to me.

32:35.873 --> 32:37.499
Please, Your Majesty!

32:37.583 --> 32:40.919
I found them guilty
of treason and forgery.

32:41.003 --> 32:43.088
We only spoke the truth.

32:43.672 --> 32:45.465
The truth you all know.

32:45.924 --> 32:50.053
She only thinks of Jerlamarel
when here, at home,

32:50.137 --> 32:52.389
the engines are breaking,
the water is rising.

32:52.472 --> 32:54.433
She is not a go--

33:03.609 --> 33:04.818
It is true.

33:08.113 --> 33:10.324
The battle I fight to save your lives...

33:11.867 --> 33:15.329
and to save your holy Payan city
is a hard one.

33:15.954 --> 33:20.167
But I fight it because that is the lot
of my lineage.

33:22.711 --> 33:28.133
As God instructs me,
I am a god as much as he allows.

33:29.092 --> 33:32.513
So, as his hands on earth,
I hold back destruction,

33:33.430 --> 33:38.227
warm the winter, cool the summer,
put magic in our fences

33:38.310 --> 33:43.065
against lions and bears who
would otherwise destroy your children...

33:44.441 --> 33:46.068
even on full bellies.

33:51.114 --> 33:55.494
But the greater battle I fight
is against light...

33:56.828 --> 34:00.249
a power that puts man above God...

34:01.625 --> 34:03.168
a power that would, once again,

34:03.252 --> 34:06.171
put leather reins and chains
on a world restored.

34:06.755 --> 34:11.217
Our armies are out in the field,
fighting these devils of light.

34:12.553 --> 34:14.012
We should honor them.

34:15.848 --> 34:17.975
Not whisper treason behind their backs.

34:23.605 --> 34:25.107
To speak against me...

34:28.193 --> 34:31.487
is to speed a return of light
and destruction.

34:32.030 --> 34:33.574
It cannot be forgiven.

34:37.744 --> 34:41.665
With regret, old friends...

34:44.208 --> 34:45.210
go.

35:01.018 --> 35:02.519
We are Payan

35:04.479 --> 35:07.733
We are holy

35:08.650 --> 35:12.779
We are chosen

35:13.197 --> 35:18.952
-We are, we are, we are
-We are, we are, we are

35:19.369 --> 35:21.038
We are Payan

35:21.997 --> 35:24.416
We are holy

35:25.334 --> 35:28.253
We are chosen

35:28.795 --> 35:33.425
-We are
-We are

36:05.541 --> 36:09.545
I brought some rose fruit for the babies.

36:17.678 --> 36:18.679
Maghra...

36:20.889 --> 36:22.432
-the air I feel--
-Yes.

36:23.684 --> 36:24.685
Yes, you do.

36:25.811 --> 36:32.192
You feel sorrow and joy somewhere,
perhaps, but mostly sorrow.

36:35.445 --> 36:36.446
Here.

36:38.031 --> 36:39.116
Their favorite toy.

36:40.534 --> 36:45.497
Place it anywhere,
anywhere you like, just quietly.

37:00.846 --> 37:05.058
Haniwa, Kofun, where's your toy?

37:05.559 --> 37:06.935
Go find your toy.

37:10.314 --> 37:11.523
Do you have it?

37:13.567 --> 37:14.735
Good girl.

37:15.152 --> 37:16.695
Now give it to Aunty Paris.

37:20.657 --> 37:21.658
Go play.

37:24.703 --> 37:28.457
And if I cover their eyes,
they can't do it anymore.

37:33.378 --> 37:35.672
I've known for a long time. And I ju--

37:36.590 --> 37:38.550
I just pretended that I didn't know.

37:39.301 --> 37:40.677
And now it is certain.

37:42.262 --> 37:43.555
To who?

37:43.639 --> 37:44.932
Baba!

37:45.015 --> 37:46.767
Come here, my loves. Come.

37:46.850 --> 37:48.810
You may go outside and play.

37:48.894 --> 37:50.229
I'll be right out.

38:09.164 --> 38:12.626
I have known
since Haniwa grabbed at my hand

38:13.293 --> 38:17.089
and told me the sun had a sister
that came out at night to play.

38:18.674 --> 38:19.675
I know.

38:21.385 --> 38:27.015
So, what Jerlamarel told you was true,
Baba Voss.

38:27.099 --> 38:31.395
These twins are the beginning
of a new world.

38:32.437 --> 38:34.356
I say we declare the truth.

38:34.439 --> 38:36.441
They are my babies.

38:37.359 --> 38:41.196
Already Souter Bax and Gether Bax
speak of us as witches.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.782
They have friends, more and more.

38:43.866 --> 38:47.160
I say we hide, we hide the truth.

38:52.958 --> 38:55.002
Jerlamarel said 12 summers.

38:58.046 --> 38:59.381
We say nothing until then.

39:02.634 --> 39:06.722
And until then,
they will live with their eyes closed.

39:17.983 --> 39:19.234
Once upon a time,

39:19.860 --> 39:25.240
there were four brothers and sisters
living happily together in a village,

39:25.616 --> 39:26.867
just like ours.

39:28.285 --> 39:30.579
They all worked together every day.

39:30.996 --> 39:34.416
One made the most fragrant perfume.

39:35.250 --> 39:38.545
Another baked the sweetest cakes.

39:39.671 --> 39:42.549
Another played the most exquisite music.

39:43.091 --> 39:48.263
And the fourth wove silk
for sheets and dresses

39:48.347 --> 39:51.391
that felt like warm snow.

39:53.519 --> 39:56.146
And they all worked happily together
every day,

39:56.730 --> 39:58.398
and they never quarreled.

40:00.484 --> 40:01.902
But then one day,

40:02.319 --> 40:06.156
a boy came along who said
he was their long-lost older brother.

40:08.033 --> 40:11.370
But when the sisters and brothers
asked him what he did...

40:12.621 --> 40:16.166
he said he told people the truth.

40:18.293 --> 40:20.254
"What truth?" they asked him.

40:21.296 --> 40:23.465
"Well," he replied...

40:24.758 --> 40:29.304
"I could tell you
that one of you is very handsome...

40:30.931 --> 40:34.476
one is quite pretty, one is plain...

40:35.686 --> 40:37.396
and one of you is very ugly."

40:39.648 --> 40:42.234
The family were very puzzled
by his words...

40:43.235 --> 40:49.241
because, if you hadn't guessed already,
the names of these brothers and sisters

40:49.992 --> 40:53.078
were Scent, Taste,

40:53.996 --> 40:57.332
Sound and Touch.

40:57.875 --> 41:02.462
And there was no "ugly"
and there was no "pretty" in their world.

41:03.380 --> 41:08.468
"But which one of us is which?"
they asked him, their brother.

41:10.387 --> 41:16.143
"Well, since you can't know,
you shouldn't care," he replied.

41:16.643 --> 41:18.979
And, with that, he went to walk off.

41:20.063 --> 41:25.444
"Wait! What's your name?"
they called to him.

41:27.404 --> 41:31.116
"My name is Vision," he replied.

41:33.118 --> 41:38.123
And with that, he rode away
and left them all alone to wonder.

41:40.292 --> 41:46.215
Soon, the family started quarreling
about which one of them was beautiful

41:46.298 --> 41:47.925
and which one was ugly.

41:49.843 --> 41:54.264
Each one of them spent so much time
wondering about what Vision had said...

41:55.349 --> 41:57.226
that the perfume lost its scent...

41:58.310 --> 42:00.562
the cakes lost their taste,

42:01.271 --> 42:03.982
the music lost all harmony,

42:04.650 --> 42:08.195
and the silk became threadbare and torn.

42:10.572 --> 42:16.036
Until, at last,
one day they came together again...

42:17.287 --> 42:20.207
and they decided to forget
what Vision had told them.

42:21.375 --> 42:26.046
Because before he came,
they'd all been perfectly content.

42:27.798 --> 42:31.593
And soon, they were content again.

42:33.262 --> 42:39.935
Because they decided
that just four was just enough.

42:42.145 --> 42:44.731
And they all lived happily ever after.

42:59.705 --> 43:00.747
Hi-ho.

43:02.165 --> 43:03.208
Hi.

43:05.460 --> 43:09.923
I have brought a gift
for the twins to share...

43:11.133 --> 43:13.135
for their birthday tomorrow.

43:15.137 --> 43:17.723
Since the river thawed,
you haven't spoken of it.

43:18.140 --> 43:19.224
Of what?

43:19.641 --> 43:21.852
We've been waiting for this day to come.

43:22.728 --> 43:24.938
Twelve years, Maghra.

43:26.940 --> 43:30.027
Of course,
you are free to do as you choose.

43:30.694 --> 43:32.529
Well, that is good of you, Paris.

43:37.034 --> 43:41.580
If you think they are still too young,
how long will you wait?

43:44.708 --> 43:46.919
Baba Voss and I have made a decision.

43:49.546 --> 43:53.800
What is buried stays buried... forever.

43:57.971 --> 43:59.348
That is your choice?

43:59.431 --> 44:00.974
It's our choice.

44:01.058 --> 44:03.393
Nothing comes between us, Paris,
not even you.

44:03.477 --> 44:06.730
So they just walk around
with their eyes closed and grow,

44:07.648 --> 44:09.024
live, die here.

44:09.107 --> 44:10.692
-And only here--
-To live!

44:10.776 --> 44:12.945
That is the thing. No, Paris?

44:13.028 --> 44:15.322
That is what I want for them,
that they live.

44:15.739 --> 44:17.407
If their secret should slip,

44:17.491 --> 44:19.409
if something from that box
should give them away,

44:19.493 --> 44:23.497
if something, anything were to happen,
and a thousand other "ifs,"

44:23.580 --> 44:24.665
they would burn.

44:25.374 --> 44:28.335
Or if the books in the box
should tell them to leave the village

44:28.418 --> 44:30.838
and they become food for lions and bears,

44:31.630 --> 44:32.881
then they will die.

44:33.882 --> 44:36.510
And if you're dead,
your eyes are closed forever.

44:38.929 --> 44:42.266
One day, someone will find us,
will find them.

44:42.349 --> 44:44.226
Maghra, they need to be prepared.

44:44.309 --> 44:46.353
-Enough!
-No, not enough!

44:47.563 --> 44:49.398
This life is not enough.

44:49.857 --> 44:51.650
Your excuse is not enough.

44:51.733 --> 44:54.570
I don't need to give you any excuses.

44:57.447 --> 44:58.490
What about Jerlamarel?

44:58.574 --> 45:01.702
Jerlamarel?
Jerlamarel did not raise these children.

45:01.785 --> 45:03.120
He did not break their fevers.

45:03.203 --> 45:07.082
He did not love them to sleep
because he was gone, just wandering.

45:08.917 --> 45:09.918
Your voice.

45:11.336 --> 45:12.546
You hate him.

45:14.756 --> 45:15.757
Why?

45:17.176 --> 45:18.218
Maghra?

45:21.638 --> 45:24.391
And why are you taking your hate
out on them?

45:24.474 --> 45:25.684
Mama!

45:28.937 --> 45:30.439
Go away, Paris.

45:31.190 --> 45:32.816
I want to be with my children.

45:54.880 --> 45:55.964
Paris.

45:56.048 --> 45:59.009
Hey, come in. Come sit.

45:59.426 --> 46:01.637
Oh, my babies.

46:02.054 --> 46:06.266
Oh, my big ones, happy birthday.

46:08.185 --> 46:10.854
You are 12 years old today.

46:13.482 --> 46:14.483
My.

46:15.192 --> 46:19.571
For 12 years, you have kept a secret.

46:19.655 --> 46:22.157
And you have kept it very well.

46:23.575 --> 46:26.745
I wonder, could you keep another?

46:27.829 --> 46:28.997
What is it?

46:29.414 --> 46:34.586
It is for you and for you only.

46:35.712 --> 46:40.008
It is the greatest birthday gift
of all time.

46:41.718 --> 46:42.803
What are they?

46:42.886 --> 46:44.346
They are books.

46:44.429 --> 46:45.931
We think they are books.

46:46.598 --> 46:51.311
Here. Here are the instructions that will
help you hear what the books are saying.

46:52.104 --> 46:53.522
Instructions from who?

46:53.605 --> 46:54.857
From your father.

46:55.524 --> 46:57.276
What does Dad know about this?

46:57.359 --> 46:58.360
No.

46:59.820 --> 47:02.072
From your true father.

47:03.740 --> 47:04.741
What?

47:05.450 --> 47:07.536
I only know what your mother told me.

47:07.953 --> 47:09.705
I was hoping
that she would tell you herself.

47:09.788 --> 47:11.623
We already have a father.

47:11.707 --> 47:16.295
I know, who loves you so very much, Kofun.

47:17.379 --> 47:18.547
Haniwa...

47:19.548 --> 47:22.551
there is also a man...

47:24.178 --> 47:27.472
who rescued your mother in a blizzard.

47:28.348 --> 47:30.100
That's the story she told.

47:30.684 --> 47:34.563
She was lost, and he saved her.

47:35.189 --> 47:37.399
And he stayed with her.

47:39.067 --> 47:41.320
And when she came to our village,

47:42.154 --> 47:46.241
you two, twins, were already inside her.

47:46.867 --> 47:49.828
-His name is Jerlamarel.
-No, no.

47:49.912 --> 47:51.705
-Wait, Haniwa.
-Kofun.

47:51.788 --> 47:54.166
Haniwa. He mustn't tell anyone.

47:54.249 --> 47:56.710
Here. Take the message and read it.

47:57.336 --> 47:59.254
You are brave. Go.

48:26.740 --> 48:28.033
Maybe we're witches.

48:29.451 --> 48:31.954
Maybe the stories about vision are true.

48:32.037 --> 48:33.038
No.

48:35.290 --> 48:37.251
I have the truth in my hands.

48:37.835 --> 48:39.962
Soon I will know and you will not.

48:44.800 --> 48:45.801
Go ahead.

48:51.598 --> 48:52.975
"Once upon a time,

48:53.475 --> 48:56.478
almost all humans had the power
that you have.

48:57.604 --> 49:01.525
Human beings used this power,
and the power of their minds,

49:02.276 --> 49:03.569
to conquer the world.

49:05.070 --> 49:07.030
They built machines that could fly,

49:07.656 --> 49:10.492
machines that could speak
across thousands of miles.

49:11.118 --> 49:14.621
They even left the earth in giant ships.

49:15.956 --> 49:21.461
Such was their power, they began
to outgrow the earth and destroy it.

49:22.754 --> 49:27.968
Some say sight was taken from them by God
to save the planet from destruction.

49:30.095 --> 49:33.974
But after so many years,
the gift of light is being restored,

49:34.808 --> 49:41.023
given only to chosen people with
an instruction to build the world again.

49:42.441 --> 49:43.775
I am your father.

49:44.651 --> 49:46.945
And I have passed this gift on to you.

49:48.488 --> 49:50.782
It is your duty to make use of it.

49:51.742 --> 49:53.827
Learn from the books I have left.

49:53.911 --> 49:55.913
I have chosen the books with care.

49:56.997 --> 49:59.708
I have also left instructions
where you should go

50:00.501 --> 50:03.629
when you feel you are strong enough
to leave your village.

50:04.129 --> 50:06.715
When you come, I will be waiting.

50:07.716 --> 50:10.469
Together, we will begin the world anew.

50:12.930 --> 50:16.266
With all my love, your loving father...

50:18.143 --> 50:19.353
Jerlamarel."

50:25.234 --> 50:26.276
What should we do?

50:43.377 --> 50:44.670
You opened the box.

50:45.921 --> 50:47.130
I did, Baba Voss.

50:47.214 --> 50:48.465
Without permission.

50:50.843 --> 50:55.722
Jerlamarel saved their lives from a bear,
and yours.

50:56.723 --> 50:58.725
He built a bridge.

50:59.142 --> 51:02.312
And guided our tribe to safety.

51:03.605 --> 51:05.524
And he made one request of you:

51:07.025 --> 51:09.361
"Let them learn."

51:10.779 --> 51:14.616
Let them discover the truth.

51:16.159 --> 51:19.079
Then let them choose.

51:23.625 --> 51:25.127
Maghra will burn the books.

51:25.502 --> 51:27.671
-So do not tell her.
-You would have me lie?

51:27.754 --> 51:33.844
For years, you told the twins
you were their father, out of kindness.

51:35.345 --> 51:38.473
Now, you must be kind to Maghra.

51:43.103 --> 51:45.189
Silence is not a lie.

51:55.782 --> 51:57.451
I heard them talking about leaving.

51:57.534 --> 51:59.661
You know they must someday.

52:02.164 --> 52:03.582
-And when they leave--
-No.

52:04.166 --> 52:10.005
When they leave,
the books will give them knowledge.

52:12.132 --> 52:14.968
Baba Voss, you are a good man.

52:17.721 --> 52:20.140
-But you have not always been.
-That is enough.

52:20.224 --> 52:24.228
Just because we are hiding here
doesn't mean the world has changed.

52:25.062 --> 52:29.358
But the twins,
Baba, the twins might be the change.

52:31.610 --> 52:33.111
They are hope, Baba.

52:35.322 --> 52:37.282
Think of the things you have witnessed.

52:37.366 --> 52:39.368
Think of the deeds you have done.

52:42.246 --> 52:43.997
Pay the world back, Baba.

52:49.169 --> 52:51.213
Silence is not a lie.

53:13.151 --> 53:14.361
Baba?

53:20.617 --> 53:23.829
Don't waste a log. I'll keep you warm.

53:52.983 --> 53:53.984
Are you all right?

53:55.152 --> 53:58.655
Yes. Everything is all right.

54:13.295 --> 54:14.505
Come to bed.

55:03.720 --> 55:04.972
What do you got?

55:07.015 --> 55:08.016
You?
