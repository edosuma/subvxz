Dear Simon,

00:04.755 --> 00:07.007
I know it's been a minute
since I've reached out,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.800
and you were probably thinking, "Wow!

00:08.800 --> 00:11.845
I bet Victor finally
has his shit together."

00:11.845 --> 00:14.473
But Simon, my shit is not together.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.767
My shit is...

00:16.767 --> 00:18.060
Well, it's shit.

00:20.896 --> 00:23.899
Benji wants to take a break from us.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.946
We've been far from perfect lately,

00:28.946 --> 00:32.366
but I thought we were strong enough
to get through anything.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.786
And now, I'm not so sure.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.500
‐ So, I told off a priest.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.128
Well, "telling off" might be a bit strong.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.421
Nobody had to hold my earrings,

00:46.421 --> 00:49.258
but I did tell Father Lawrence
that we're quitting the church.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.635
‐ Cool.

00:51.635 --> 00:54.596
‐ And I found another congregation
in Five Points.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.558
Their website says all are welcome,

00:57.558 --> 01:00.477
which is Catholic for less homophobic.

Victor...

01:05.482 --> 01:06.942
Is everything okay?

01:09.069 --> 01:13.073

there isn't a pomade in the world

01:39.641 --> 01:42.561
Should we shave his head in his sleep
and make a wig?

01:42.561 --> 01:44.813
We could share it.

Okay, that was funny. Are you okay?

‐ Benji and I are taking a break.
It was his choice.

‐ What? Why?
‐ I don't know. A lot of things.

01:54.907 --> 01:57.784
I mean, he wasn't too thrilled
that I told you that he was in AA.

I swear.
‐ No, no, no.

I know, and it's, it's not your fault.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.459

But it's not just that. We've been
fighting about everything lately.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.151

works out for me, too.

02:34.613 --> 02:35.989

saying it's some made up
Muslim holiday.

None of those old ladies in admin want to

your dad sounds like.

Ah, yeah, sorry about that. Um,

04:08.707 --> 04:10.876
look, Victah's not gonna be
able to come in today.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.544
Yeah, he'd kill me for telling you this,

04:12.544 --> 04:15.088
but he got into some bad
chimichangas last night,

04:15.088 --> 04:17.966
and let's just say he got it
comin' out of both ends.

04:18.717 --> 04:21.053
Yeah‐‐ Aw, thank you so much.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.847
Aw, that's so sweet. Adios!

04:27.184 --> 04:29.436

04:31.688 --> 04:33.941
I never would have pegged you
as the "cutting class" type.

04:33.941 --> 04:37.819
‐ Hey. Don't judge a book
by it's extremely chic cover.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.863
It's just sometimes I feel like

04:39.863 --> 04:43.659
all these Creekwood kids are living
in their happy little bubbles,

04:43.659 --> 04:46.870
and I'm not like any of them.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.997
Sometimes I feel outside of it all.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.332
And when that happens,

04:50.332 --> 04:56.255
I need to get out from under the
tragic fluorescent lighting and breathe.

04:56.255 --> 04:59.842
But today's your day to breathe.
So, what do you want to do?

04:59.842 --> 05:01.593
‐ I don't know.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.804
I can't stop thinking about Benji.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.098
I mean, we were supposed to go to
Mia's dad's wedding this weekend,

05:06.098 --> 05:09.434
and now‐‐
‐ Okay, so we just have to
get your mind off of Benji.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.770
‐ But everywhere reminds me of him.

05:11.770 --> 05:15.357
‐ Okay, then we'll go somewhere you
and Benji have never been before.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.609
A Benji memory‐free zone.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.361
I know just the place.

SERVER: Here you go. Enjoy.
‐ Thanks.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.994
Okay, what am I eating,
and why haven't I had it before? [laughs]

05:26.994 --> 05:30.289
‐ It's Tahchin.
A crispy rice cake, with chicken.

05:30.289 --> 05:33.000
Anytime I'm in my feels,
I have to have that.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.961
‐ It kind of reminds me of my mom's
arroz con pollo.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.754
She used to make it every Sunday
after church.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.922
‐ Used to?

05:38.922 --> 05:41.008
‐ Well, now that she and my dad
are separated...

05:41.008 --> 05:43.635
‐ Oh, yeah. How are things going
with that, by the way?

05:43.635 --> 05:47.681
‐ I don't know. It's on the long list
of things that we don't talk about.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.728
‐ What about you?
How are things with your parents?

05:52.728 --> 05:54.104
‐ Actually...

05:56.607 --> 05:58.233
Remember when I told you

05:58.233 --> 06:00.485
I didn't finish Lord of the Flies
last night?

06:02.070 --> 06:04.573
‐ It's 'cause I was coming out
to my parents.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.326
‐ What? Rahim!
Why didn't you tell me before?

06:07.326 --> 06:09.203
‐ I don't know.
You were so bummed about Benji,

06:09.203 --> 06:10.662
and I didn't want to make today about me.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.165
‐ So, how did you do it?

06:13.165 --> 06:15.209
‐ This is humiliating,

06:15.209 --> 06:18.504
but I wrote everything
I wanted to say on a notecard,

06:18.504 --> 06:22.257
because I knew once I took it out,
I wouldn't be able to bail.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.051
And I didn't. I, I read it to them,

06:24.051 --> 06:28.222
and they sat there for
what felt like six years,

06:28.222 --> 06:31.850
and my, my dad said,
"I'm really happy you finally told us."

06:31.850 --> 06:34.520
‐ Wait. They were glad that you
"finally" told them?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.522
‐ Okay, so apparently,
my mom had discovered

06:36.522 --> 06:39.066
my internet search history
when I was twelve,

06:39.066 --> 06:42.569
and saw that I had been Googling
"Tom Holland" plus "penis."

06:42.569 --> 06:43.904
VICTOR:
No! [laughs]

06:43.904 --> 06:46.073
Tom Holland?
‐ I know.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.992
Anyway, thank you.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.913
For helping me be brave.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.251
‐ No. Rahim, you did that all on your own.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.004
I'm... I'm really proud of you.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.756
[phone chimes]

07:07.261 --> 07:08.720
Is something going on?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.097
‐ No. Sorry.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.515
‐ Victor?

07:12.266 --> 07:13.392
‐ Dad?

07:18.647 --> 07:20.440
‐ Victor, why aren't you in school?

07:23.193 --> 07:25.737
‐ That, that would be my fault,
Mr. Salazar.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.783
I had to miss school today for the
Muslim Festival of a Thousand Pistachios.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.159
Very sacred.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.036
Uh, Victor had a free period,

07:33.036 --> 07:35.914
and he was kind enough to bring me
my homework so I wouldn't fall behind.

07:35.914 --> 07:39.042
I'm Rahim, by the way.
‐ Hi.

07:39.042 --> 07:43.255
Oh, uh, sorry. Uh, Victor, this is, uh,
my friend Shelby.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.632
‐ So nice to meet you, Victor.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.926
Your dad talks about you all the time.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.970
‐ He does? When?

07:49.970 --> 07:54.057
‐ PFLAG. Shelby and I, we know
each other from the meetings.

07:55.726 --> 07:58.645
Uh, Victor, can we talk for a second?

08:01.773 --> 08:04.985
‐ Happy holidays. I just love pistachios.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.028
[both chuckle softly]

08:08.322 --> 08:10.657
‐ Are you on a date right now?
‐ Shelby and I...

08:12.034 --> 08:13.827
Yes, we're seeing each other.

08:13.827 --> 08:18.415
It's very new. It's too new
to tell you about, but here we are.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.168
‐ Does Mom know?
‐ She does.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.130
‐ So, that's it?

08:25.130 --> 08:28.342
You guys are never getting back together?
You're just giving up on her?

08:28.342 --> 08:30.219
‐ Victor, I'm not giving up on anything.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.930
‐ You're dating other people.
You're not even trying anymore.

08:32.930 --> 08:36.600
‐ Look, I think that this is a much
bigger conversation.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.644
And maybe me catching you skipping school

08:38.644 --> 08:40.979
is not the best time to have it.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.564
Your friend over there,
he's pretty smooth,

08:42.564 --> 08:43.815
but I wasn't born yesterday.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.817
‐ Are you gonna tell Mom?

08:47.236 --> 08:50.030
‐ If you head back to class now,
maybe I'll forget to mention it.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.745
VICTOR:
I can't believe my dad got a girlfriend.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.289
God. How could he do this to my mom?

09:01.792 --> 09:04.336
‐ Can I ask you a personal question?
‐ Mmm.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.257
‐ Do you think your parents
should get back together?

09:08.257 --> 09:11.552
Like, do you think that
they're right for each other?

09:16.223 --> 09:21.061
‐ I don't know. I mean, last year,
they were constantly fighting.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.231
And sometimes I just wished they'd
get the hell away from each other

09:24.231 --> 09:25.482
and give us all a break.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.402
Before that...

09:30.237 --> 09:31.947
They were pretty magic together.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.243
I mean, they were our age
when they started dating.

09:36.952 --> 09:39.997
But maybe that's part of the problem.
You know, like...

09:39.997 --> 09:42.833
what are the odds that the first person
you date is the person

09:42.833 --> 09:44.751
you're supposed to end up with?

09:47.504 --> 09:51.300
‐ Okay, I don't care what your dad says.
We're not going back to school.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.635
It's time to turn the self‐care
up to an eleven.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.309
VICTOR: You know, I've never actually
had a pedicure before.

10:00.309 --> 10:04.104
‐ You're acting like this is news,
but those hooves are rough.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.399
Linda, Michelle,
the number 4 special, please.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.775
"Oh oh aubergine" for me,

10:08.775 --> 10:12.321
and "clear" for my very
wild friend over here.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.989
‐ Okay. [laughs]
[phone alerts]

10:17.826 --> 10:20.787
Okay, why do you keep grinning
at your phone like that?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.248
Did Tom Holland slide into your DMs?
‐ No!

10:23.248 --> 10:27.252
Okay? It's just this guy Charlie
I've been talking to on one of those apps.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.755
You know which one.
‐ Well, let me see.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.304
Wait. Are all these
headless torsos in Atlanta?

10:37.304 --> 10:39.056
‐ This is just guys nearby.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.683
Turns out there's a ton of gay fish
in the online sea.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.894
‐ And all the fish claim
to have 9‐inch dicks.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.437
‐ Yeah, all the fish kind of lie.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.649
Like when Charlie and I started talking,
we both said we were twenty‐two.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.235
But turns out he's a senior
at Thadwick Academy.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.444
‐ Thadwick?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.695
‐ Damn. Your boyfriend's bougie.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.657
‐ He's not my boyfriend, okay?
We, we haven't even met.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.867
We just text a lot.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.079
And send the occasional
mildly scandalous pic.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.039
‐ You should ask him
if he wants to meet up.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.416
‐ What, like now?

11:06.416 --> 11:09.127
‐ You said I get to pick what we do today,
and this is what I pick.

11:10.212 --> 11:13.215
‐ I can't believe I'm actually
gonna do this.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.008
I feel a pimple starting on my chin,

11:15.008 --> 11:17.010
and this isn't even
one of my top‐tier outfits.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.513
‐ Well, lucky for you, we're in a spa.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.723
Linda, Michelle, give him the works.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.851
‐ I have $17 in my wallet.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.770
‐ Give him $17 worth of works.

RAHIM:
Okay, you sure you don't mind being here?

11:28.647 --> 11:31.024
‐ No. Benji's not working today.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.360
And plus, I know where
we keep the pepper spray

11:33.360 --> 11:36.113

a sixty‐year‐old murderer

11:36.113 --> 11:38.907
whose kink is decapitating high school
students with a box cutter.

11:40.325 --> 11:43.078
Do you think you're the only person
that watches true crime?
[Rahim chuckles]

11:48.542 --> 11:50.377
‐ Oh, my God. I think that's him.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.592
Okay, I would so let him decapitate me.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.719
‐ Maybe don't start with that.
‐ Right.

11:59.761 --> 12:00.846
‐ Go.

12:02.139 --> 12:04.266
‐ Charlie. Hi‐yee!

12:04.266 --> 12:08.145
I don't know why I just said "hi"
like that. I'm nervous.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.980
‐ It's fine. Nice to meet you.
‐ Yeah.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.065
You look just like your pics, thank God.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.110
A lot of people use those ring light
things that make their pores disappear,

12:15.110 --> 12:17.321
and they end up looking like
hideous monsters in real life,

12:17.321 --> 12:20.866
but you don't.
So, drop that skincare routine, sis!

12:21.742 --> 12:23.619
‐ Thanks. Thank you.
[Rahim chuckles]

12:25.204 --> 12:26.538
What's good here?

12:26.538 --> 12:30.292
‐ Ah, well, the chili mocha latte
is my personal obsesh.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.544
She's serving spicy, she's serving sweet.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.129
You need her in your life.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.509
‐ "Her" as in the, the coffee?

12:39.134 --> 12:42.095
‐ Uh, why don't you order,
and I'll grab us a table?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.430
‐ Hey, um...

12:43.430 --> 12:45.474
Sorry. Uh...

12:45.474 --> 12:48.310
You're, you're just different
from how I pictured.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.105
‐ What do you mean?
‐ No, I just‐‐ Like the...

12:52.105 --> 12:53.357
The way you talk.

12:53.357 --> 12:57.277
And like, the way you... are.

12:58.237 --> 12:59.696
Sorry, I‐‐

12:59.696 --> 13:02.407
I tend to go for guys
who are a bit more masculine?

13:02.407 --> 13:04.618
No offense.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.869
‐ Oh.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.496
CHARLIE:
Yeah. It's just my preference.

13:07.496 --> 13:10.916
RAHIM: Yeah. No, if you're not into it,
you're not into it.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.130
[door opens]

13:21.969 --> 13:23.303
[door closes]

13:24.304 --> 13:26.849
‐ I kind of wish
he'd decapitated me instead.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.690
I'm so embarrassed.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.483
I can't believe you just saw that.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.652
‐ No, he should be embarrassed.
What a dick.

13:38.652 --> 13:42.072
‐ No. I, I get it.
If he's into "masc" guys or whatever,

13:42.072 --> 13:44.116
I'm never gonna be that.

13:44.116 --> 13:46.034
I'm wearing lavender suede.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.287
‐ Okay, first off, that jacket is fire,
and you know it.

13:48.287 --> 13:51.790
And secondly, don't let one stupid boy
ruin what's great about you.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.042
‐ Except it's not just one stupid boy.

13:54.042 --> 13:58.505
You know, a lot of people see me as just
this funny, fruity beanpole,

13:58.505 --> 14:00.966
and nothing else.
‐ All right, that's bullshit.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.635
You're tall, you're smart,
you're super handsome‐‐

14:03.635 --> 14:05.012
‐ Super handsome?

14:05.012 --> 14:07.890
‐ Stop. I'm just saying that objectively,

14:07.890 --> 14:09.141
you're a very good looking guy.

14:09.141 --> 14:12.728
‐ Okay. Okay, this is the content
I signed up for.

14:12.728 --> 14:15.647
Can you start an OnlyFans where
it's just you complimenting me?

14:15.647 --> 14:17.900
Maybe in an ASMR whisper voice?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.694
‐ I'm trying to tell you something.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.446
You're a catch, Rahim.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.283
And, uh,

14:26.283 --> 14:29.620
if we went to a gay bar,
you would totally clean up.

14:29.620 --> 14:33.832
‐ Well. I'm pretty sure you would
clean up at a gay bar, too.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.669
If you were single.
Which you're not.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.380
Because things are gonna work out
between you and Benji.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.091

14:56.063 --> 14:58.690
‐ You know what?
We don't we go to a gay bar?

14:58.690 --> 15:01.944
‐ Really? I don't have, like,
an ID or anything.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.821
‐ So? I went to one in New York,
and they never even checked.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.116
RAHIM:
Ugh, no...

15:08.116 --> 15:10.452
‐ Okay, we can do this.
Just act confident,

15:10.452 --> 15:13.288
and try to make yourself look older,
like, like, beaten down by life.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.373

15:15.666 --> 15:18.418
