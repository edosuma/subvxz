WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:33.637 --> 00:33.937
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:34.004 --> 00:35.136
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:35.205 --> 00:35.305
US.

00:35.372 --> 00:37.004
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:37.073 --> 00:38.473
THE U.N. CLIMATE CONFERENCE

00:38.542 --> 00:40.341
KICKED OFF, RON DeSANTIS DEBATED

00:40.410 --> 00:41.909
GAVIN NEWSOM IN A REAL CLASH OF

00:41.978 --> 00:44.779
THE WHO GIVES A SHIT, AND THERE

00:44.848 --> 00:45.413
WAS A NOTABLE DEATH IN THE WORLD

00:45.482 --> 00:46.481
THAT ONE TIKTOK ACCOUNT TREATED

00:46.550 --> 00:47.849
WITH THE DIGNITY IT TRULY

00:47.918 --> 00:49.217
DESERVED.

00:49.286 --> 00:50.351
>> BREAKING NEWS.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.153
FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE

00:52.222 --> 00:53.588
HENRY KISSINGER HAS PASSED AWAY

00:53.657 --> 00:54.856
AT THE AGE OF 100.

00:54.925 --> 00:56.057
KISSINGER SERVED AS AMERICA'S

00:56.126 --> 00:57.592
TOP DIPLOMAT AND NATIONAL

00:57.661 --> 00:59.327
SECURITY ADVISER DURING THE

00:59.396 --> 01:00.761
NIXON AND FORD ADMINISTRATIONS.

01:00.830 --> 01:01.863
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT,

01:01.932 --> 01:03.231
HENRY KISSINGER DIED AT THE RIPE

01:03.300 --> 01:06.067
OLD AGE OF "NOT SOON ENOUGH."

01:06.136 --> 01:07.535
AND IF YOU LIVE IN AMERICA, YOU

01:07.604 --> 01:08.136
MIGHT VIEW HIM AS A

01:08.205 --> 01:09.837
CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE.

01:09.906 --> 01:10.638
BUT IF YOU LIVE IN CHILE,

01:10.707 --> 01:11.806
ARGENTINA, VIETNAM, CAMBODIA,

01:11.875 --> 01:13.141
EAST TIMOR, BANGLADESH, OR

01:13.210 --> 01:14.675
ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH, YOU KNOW

01:14.744 --> 01:16.210
THAT'S MAYBE THE MOST OBSCENE

01:16.279 --> 01:18.546
UNDERSTATEMENT OF ALL TIME.

01:18.615 --> 01:19.147
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT SOME

01:19.216 --> 01:22.216
WEREN'T UPSET.

01:22.285 --> 01:22.817
THE NEW YORK YANKEES TWEETED,

01:22.886 --> 01:25.153
AMONG OTHER LIES, "HE WILL BE

01:25.222 --> 01:26.053
DEEPLY MISSED."

01:26.122 --> 01:26.556
WHICH, HONESTLY, TRACKS.

01:26.623 --> 01:27.123
IF THERE'S ONE BASEBALL TEAM

01:27.190 --> 01:28.156
THAT COULD APPRECIATE A MAN

01:28.225 --> 01:29.757
BEHIND A WIDELY HATED, MORALLY

01:29.826 --> 01:30.958
CORRUPT EMPIRE WHICH USED ITS

01:31.027 --> 01:32.193
CONSIDERABLE FINANCIAL RESOURCES

01:32.262 --> 01:33.327
TO DESTROY ITS ENEMIES BY ANY

01:33.396 --> 01:34.929
MEANS NECESSARY, IT'S THE

01:34.998 --> 01:37.331
YANKEES.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.966
BUT RATHER THAN CONTINUE TO

01:39.035 --> 01:40.334
CELEBRATE THAT MAN GOING TO

01:40.403 --> 01:41.969
HELL, WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO

01:42.038 --> 01:44.539
CONGRESS, WHICH ON FRIDAY DID

01:44.608 --> 01:44.741
THIS.

01:44.808 --> 01:45.606
>> THE GEORGE SANTOS SAGA IS

01:45.675 --> 01:49.577
OFFICIALLY OVER.

01:49.646 --> 01:50.113
WITHIN HOURS OF HIS HOUSE

01:50.180 --> 01:52.013
COLLEAGUES VOTING TO MAKE HIM

01:52.082 --> 01:53.581
JUST THE SIXTH MEMBER IN HISTORY

01:53.650 --> 01:56.918
EXPELLED FROM OFFICE, CREWS WERE

01:56.987 --> 01:58.453
CHANGING THE LOCKS ON HIS

01:58.522 --> 01:59.353
WASHINGTON OFFICE DOORS.

01:59.422 --> 02:00.855
>> HIS FINAL REMARK, REPORTEDLY,

02:00.924 --> 02:01.622
"WHY WOULD I WANT TO STAY

02:01.691 --> 02:02.223
HERE?

02:02.292 --> 02:04.492
TO HELL WITH THIS PLACE."

02:04.561 --> 02:05.493
>> John: YEAH, THEY FINALLY

02:05.562 --> 02:06.394
KICKED GEORGE SANTOS OUT.

02:06.463 --> 02:07.862
AND I SAY FINALLY BECAUSE IT

02:07.931 --> 02:08.496
WAS THEIR THIRD ATTEMPT AT DOING

02:08.565 --> 02:09.997
THAT.

02:10.066 --> 02:11.299
APPARENTLY, IT TAKES THREE TRIES

02:11.368 --> 02:11.899
TO GET RID OF HIM -- A SORT OF

02:11.968 --> 02:13.134
"REVERSE BEETLEJUICE" SITUATION,

02:13.203 --> 02:15.236
IF YOU WILL.

02:15.305 --> 02:16.037
WHAT PROBABLY PUSHED IT OVER THE

02:16.106 --> 02:17.171
TOP THIS TIME THOUGH WAS THE

02:17.240 --> 02:18.673
RELEASE TWO WEEKS AGO OF A

02:18.742 --> 02:20.908
SCATHING ETHICS COMMITTEE REPORT

02:20.977 --> 02:21.509
CONTAINING ACCUSATIONS ABOUT,

02:21.578 --> 02:22.110
AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIS USE OF

02:22.179 --> 02:24.078
CAMPAIGN FUNDS.

02:24.147 --> 02:25.413
>> THE PROBE FOUND HE USED SOME

02:25.482 --> 02:28.082
OF THE MONEY FOR BOTOX

02:28.151 --> 02:28.651
TREATMENTS, LUXURY SHOPPING

02:28.718 --> 02:30.251
SPREES AT HERMES AND FERRAGAMO,

02:30.320 --> 02:31.352
TRIPS TO ATLANTIC CITY AND THE

02:31.421 --> 02:32.954
HAMPTONS, AND A SUBSCRIPTION TO

02:33.023 --> 02:36.090
THE ADULT WEBSITE ONLYFANS.

02:36.159 --> 02:37.225
>> John: OKAY, LOOK.

02:37.294 --> 02:38.059
I'VE BEEN TRYING -- WE'VE ALL

02:38.128 --> 02:39.861
BEEN TRYING.

02:39.930 --> 02:40.396
TO SHAKE OUR HEADS AND SAY

02:40.463 --> 02:47.301
THINGS LIKE 'THAT'S NOT

02:47.370 --> 02:47.837
BEFITTING OF THE OFFICE".

02:47.904 --> 02:48.404
BECAUSE WE KNOW: THAT'S NOT

02:48.471 --> 02:48.638
ALLOWED.

02:48.705 --> 02:49.270
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

02:49.339 --> 02:49.672
BUT I HAVE TO SAY.

02:49.739 --> 02:50.371
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING

02:50.440 --> 02:55.910
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO,

02:55.979 --> 02:56.644
THAT IS THE WAY TO FUCKING DO

02:56.713 --> 02:56.813
IT.

02:56.880 --> 02:57.380
LOOKING GOOD, GOING OUT, AND

02:57.447 --> 02:58.012
GETTING OFF ON GIG ECONOMY PORN?

02:58.081 --> 02:58.646
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BE MAD HE

02:58.715 --> 02:59.947
SPENT CAMPAIGN FUNDS VIBING OUT

03:00.016 --> 03:00.782
ON DIVA SHIT?

03:00.851 --> 03:01.351
AND WHILE SANTOS DENIES ALL

03:01.418 --> 03:03.451
THAT, THE SPENDING WAS JUST THE

03:03.520 --> 03:07.655
TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

03:07.724 --> 03:08.289
THE REPORT ALSO INCLUDED A FULL

03:08.358 --> 03:09.290
COPY OF THE "OPPOSITION REPORT"

03:09.359 --> 03:11.092
HIS OWN CAMPAIGN COMMISSIONED ON

03:11.161 --> 03:12.794
HIM, TITLED "THE GEORGE SANTOS

03:12.863 --> 03:15.997
VULNERABILITY REPORT," WHICH WAS

03:16.066 --> 03:17.498
141 PAGES LONG, FEATURING

03:17.567 --> 03:19.100
SECTIONS LIKE, "FLORIDA DRIVERS

03:19.169 --> 03:20.768
LICENSE SUSPENSION," "UNVERIFIED

03:20.837 --> 03:22.937
DEGREES" AND "SECURITIES FRAUD

03:23.006 --> 03:25.206
PONZI SCHEME."

03:25.275 --> 03:26.240
EVEN THE COVER WAS DAMNING, AS

03:26.309 --> 03:26.874
THIS WAS THE ACTUAL PHOTO THEY

03:26.943 --> 03:30.611
USED, WHICH IS SPECTACULAR.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.213
IT'S A PHOTO THAT SAYS, "OPENING

03:32.282 --> 03:34.715
FOR SEBASTIAN MANISCALCO" OR, "I

03:34.784 --> 03:36.050
FAKED MY OWN DEATH FOR INSURANCE

03:36.119 --> 03:38.252
MONEY: A TED TALK" AND SANTOS

03:38.321 --> 03:38.853
DID NOT TAKE THE VOTE AGAINST

03:38.922 --> 03:40.788
HIM LIGHTLY.

03:40.857 --> 03:41.722
AHEAD OF IT, HE GAVE A PRESS

03:41.791 --> 03:42.690
CONFERENCE THAT WAS UPSTAGED BY

03:42.759 --> 03:43.324
A GARBAGE TRUCK APPEARING IN THE

03:43.393 --> 03:45.760
BACKGROUND.

03:45.829 --> 03:47.462
WHICH IS PERFECTLY ON-THE-NOSE.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.063
HE ALSO VENTED HIS FRUSTRATION

03:49.132 --> 03:50.064
AT WHAT HE SAW AS A DOUBLE

03:50.133 --> 03:51.566
STANDARD.

03:51.635 --> 03:53.100
>> I MEAN, WITHIN THE RANKS OF

03:53.169 --> 03:55.269
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS,

03:55.338 --> 03:57.071
THERE'S FELONS GALORE, THERE'S

03:57.140 --> 03:59.907
PEOPLE WITH ALL SORTS OF SHEISTY

03:59.976 --> 04:02.643
BACKGROUNDS, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

04:02.712 --> 04:04.178
GEORGE SANTOS IS THE MARY

04:04.247 --> 04:05.079
MAGDALENE OF UNITED STATES

04:05.148 --> 04:07.815
CONGRESS.

04:07.884 --> 04:08.983
WE'RE ALL GONNA STONE THIS

04:09.052 --> 04:09.750
MOTHERFUCKER BECAUSE IT'S JUST

04:09.819 --> 04:10.818
POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT.

04:10.887 --> 04:11.586
RIGHT?

04:11.655 --> 04:12.220
NOW, NO PUN INTENDED, I WAS BORN

04:12.289 --> 04:15.756
ON MARY MAGDALENE'S DAY, WHICH

04:15.825 --> 04:17.725
IS JULY 22ND, WHICH, I FIND IT

04:17.794 --> 04:20.561
TO BE ABSOLUTELY IRONIC.

04:20.630 --> 04:21.662
>> John: NOW OBVIOUSLY, EVERY

04:21.731 --> 04:22.797
WORD OF THAT IS A JEWEL AND IT'S

04:22.866 --> 04:23.366
IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK THE

04:23.433 --> 04:26.234
SPARKLIEST.

04:26.303 --> 04:27.468
I MEAN, FIRST, IT'S GOOD THAT HE

04:27.537 --> 04:28.336
SAID, "NO PUN INTENDED" BECAUSE

04:28.405 --> 04:31.906
NO PUN DETECTED.

04:31.975 --> 04:33.074
SECOND, THAT'S NOT IRONY, IT'S A

04:33.143 --> 04:34.675
COINCIDENCE.

04:34.744 --> 04:36.144
AND FINALLY, NOT TO BE A TOTAL

04:36.213 --> 04:37.145
ASTROLOGY GIRLIE, BUT IT MAKES

04:37.214 --> 04:39.180
SO MUCH SENSE THAT HE'S A

04:39.249 --> 04:40.414
CANCER/LEO CUSP.

04:40.483 --> 04:41.649
PRONE TO FITS OF EMOTION, LOVES

04:41.718 --> 04:43.384
TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION,

04:43.453 --> 04:44.986
AND RECENTLY HARD LAUNCHED A

04:45.055 --> 04:45.887
HUSBAND.

04:45.956 --> 04:48.189
THAT SHIT IS TEXTBOOK.

04:48.258 --> 04:49.323
THE TRUTH IS, THIS MAN NEVER

04:49.392 --> 04:49.991
BELONGED IN CONGRESS.

04:50.060 --> 04:51.659
HE BELONGS ON BRAVO.

04:51.728 --> 04:53.194
JUST THINK OF EVERYTHING HE

04:53.263 --> 04:53.828
PACKED IN DURING HIS BRIEF TIME

04:53.897 --> 04:55.530
ON THE NATIONAL STAGE.

04:55.599 --> 04:56.130
LIKE WHEN HE IMPLIED THAT HIS

04:56.199 --> 04:57.231
YOUNG NIECE HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED

04:57.300 --> 04:59.367
FROM A PLAYGROUND IN QUEENS,

04:59.436 --> 05:00.935
POSSIBLY IN RETALIATION FOR HIS

05:01.004 --> 05:02.470
PUBLIC COMMENTS ABOUT CHINA, OR

05:02.539 --> 05:04.405
THAT "9/11 CLAIMED MY MOTHERS

05:04.474 --> 05:05.273
LIFE" EVEN THOUGH RECORDS SHOW

05:05.342 --> 05:07.074
SHE WASN'T EVEN IN NEW YORK AT

05:07.143 --> 05:08.209
THE TIME.

05:08.278 --> 05:09.677
THAT KIND OF MESSINESS ISN'T

05:09.746 --> 05:11.479
JUST "FRIENDS-OF" BEHAVIOR, IT'S

05:11.548 --> 05:13.314
FULL-ON HOUSEWIFE.

05:13.383 --> 05:15.516
SANTOS WAS UNMATCHED AT GIVING

05:15.585 --> 05:16.984
US A+ HEADLINES LIKE "GEORGE

05:17.053 --> 05:18.453
SANTOS HAS MELTDOWN WHILE

05:18.522 --> 05:21.522
HOLDING MYSTERY BABY."

05:21.591 --> 05:22.156
AND BY THE WAY, WHEN SANTOS WAS

05:22.225 --> 05:24.625
ASKED IF THAT BABY WAS HIS, HIS

05:24.694 --> 05:26.561
ANSWER WAS, "NOT YET."

05:26.630 --> 05:28.229
WHICH IS THE SINGLE FUNNIEST

05:28.298 --> 05:30.364
POSSIBLE ANSWER, OUTSIDE OF

05:30.433 --> 05:33.201
MAYBE, "WHAT BABY?"

05:33.270 --> 05:34.035
I'M JUST SAYING, SANTOS CLEARLY

05:34.104 --> 05:35.236
DIDN'T DELIVER FOR HIS

05:35.305 --> 05:37.171
CONSTITUENTS, BUT HE DELIVERED

05:37.240 --> 05:38.372
HARD FOR THE REST OF US.

05:38.441 --> 05:39.207
AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE IN MY

05:39.276 --> 05:40.041
GOVERNMENT.

05:40.110 --> 05:40.675
AND I DON'T WANT TO SIT NEXT TO

05:40.744 --> 05:42.310
HIM ON AN AIRPLANE.

05:42.379 --> 05:44.178
BUT I DEFINITELY WANT HIM IN

05:44.247 --> 05:44.714
ANDY COHEN'S MENAGERIE OF

05:44.781 --> 05:47.849
DAMAGED HUMAN BEINGS.

05:47.918 --> 05:49.283
CALL THIS MAN NOW, COHEN, AND

05:49.352 --> 05:51.586
PAY HIM WHAT HE'S WORTH.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.654
AND NOW THIS.

05:53.723 --> 05:55.289
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

05:55.358 --> 05:58.025
PEOPLE ON TV TALK ABOUT AI THE

05:58.094 --> 06:00.361
ONLY WAY THEY KNOW HOW.

06:00.430 --> 06:01.996
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

06:02.065 --> 06:04.899
THE "TERMINATOR" MOVIES, WHERE

06:04.968 --> 06:05.500
THE COMPUTERS AND THE MACHINES

06:05.569 --> 06:06.200
STARTED ACTING LIKE HUMANS.

06:06.269 --> 06:07.135
THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF WHEN I

06:07.204 --> 06:07.570
THINK OF ARTIFICIAL

06:07.637 --> 06:10.638
INTELLIGENCE.

06:10.707 --> 06:14.509
>> AS SOMEONE WHO'S FAVORITE

06:14.578 --> 06:15.143
MOVIE IS "T2 JUDGMENT DAY", I'M

06:15.212 --> 06:15.777
CONCERNED ABOUT THESE MACHINES

06:15.846 --> 06:16.377
BECOMING SELF-AWARE AND TAKING

06:16.446 --> 06:17.945
OVER.

06:18.014 --> 06:18.813
I LAUGH, BUT I'M ALSO QUITE

06:18.882 --> 06:19.580
SERIOUS ABOUT IT.

06:19.649 --> 06:21.215
>> THERE WAS A MOVIE ABOUT THIS.

06:21.284 --> 06:21.883
WHICH ONE?

06:21.952 --> 06:22.784
>> "TERMINATOR".

06:22.853 --> 06:26.988
>> MAKES YOU HAVE A VISION OF

06:27.057 --> 06:27.490
"TERMINATOR" AND SKYNET.

06:27.557 --> 06:28.122
>> ALL OF US HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE

06:28.191 --> 06:30.358
"TERMINATOR", WE KNOW HOW THIS

06:30.427 --> 06:30.560
ENDS.

06:30.627 --> 06:34.328
>> I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

06:34.397 --> 06:35.263
>> THIS IS "TERMINATOR" ALL OVER

06:35.332 --> 06:36.497
AGAIN.

06:36.566 --> 06:37.665
I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE.

06:37.734 --> 06:40.334
>> YOU'RE SCARED OF AI?

06:40.403 --> 06:42.370
>> YES, I'M SCARED, HAVE YOU

06:42.439 --> 06:42.772
SEEN "TERMINATOR"?

06:42.839 --> 06:45.440
>> IS AI REALLY STEPS AWAY FROM

06:45.509 --> 06:47.742
BEING THE "TERMINATOR" OF

06:47.811 --> 06:50.511
HUMANITIES FUTURE?

06:50.580 --> 06:51.913
PLUS, KYRA SEDGWICK IS LIVE TO

06:51.982 --> 06:54.215
TALK ABOUT CELEBRATING 35 YEARS

09:25.235 --> 09:26.067

09:26.136 --> 09:27.735
BUT THE SYSTEM THAT HANDLES OUR

09:27.804 --> 09:28.669

09:28.738 --> 09:30.571
-- WHICH SOMETIMES LEAK INTO

09:31.708 --> 09:33.174
LIKE THIS ONE, ABOUT A DONOR

09:33.243 --> 09:34.942
HEART THAT WAS BEING SENT FOR

09:35.011 --> 09:35.543
PROCESSING TO MAKE LIFE-SAVING

09:35.612 --> 09:38.279
TISSUE GRAFTS.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.019
THIS HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND.

09:45.088 --> 09:45.853
THIS WAS A DONOR HEART OF

09:45.922 --> 09:46.554
COURSE.

09:46.623 --> 09:48.489
IT WAS HEADED TO A CLINIC IN

09:48.558 --> 09:49.323
SEATTLE FROM SACRAMENTO, BUT

09:49.392 --> 09:50.458
SOMEONE APPARENTLY FORGOT TO

09:50.527 --> 09:51.926
UNLOAD THAT HEART WHEN IT

09:51.995 --> 09:53.427
REACHED SEATTLE.

09:53.496 --> 09:54.762
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

09:54.831 --> 09:55.863
PILOT MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN

09:55.932 --> 09:58.166
THEY TURNED AROUND THAT THEY

09:58.235 --> 09:58.900
WERE RETURNING BECAUSE THERE WAS

09:58.969 --> 09:59.967

LIKE A LANA DEL REY LYRIC.

10:08.812 --> 10:10.778
BUT ALSO, IT'S WORTH MENTIONING,

10:10.847 --> 10:12.280
A FEW YEARS AGO, SOUTHWEST

10:12.349 --> 10:13.714
CELEBRATED THEIR FIFTIETH

10:13.783 --> 10:14.582
ANNIVERSARY WITH A CAMPAIGN

10:14.651 --> 10:15.983
FEATURING THIS GRAPHIC AND THE

10:16.052 --> 10:17.185
WORDS "FIFTY YEARS.

10:17.254 --> 10:18.686
ONE HEART."

10:18.755 --> 10:19.620
WHICH PROBABLY SHOULD'VE BEEN

10:19.689 --> 10:20.922
UPDATED TO READ "FIFTY YEARS,

10:20.991 --> 10:21.556
ONE HEART THAT WE TOTALLY FORGOT

10:21.625 --> 10:22.058
ABOUT AND ALMOST SENT TO

10:22.125 --> 10:24.892
DALLAS."

10:24.961 --> 10:26.894
AND WHILE WE THANKFULLY HAD OVER

10:26.963 --> 10:27.495
42,000 TRANSPLANTS LAST YEAR,

10:27.564 --> 10:29.230

10:36.006 --> 10:38.406

10:38.475 --> 10:39.040

10:39.109 --> 10:40.641

10:40.710 --> 10:41.342
OUR ORGAN-TRANSPLANT SYSTEM

10:41.411 --> 10:43.845

10:43.914 --> 10:44.445
IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER PEOPLE

10:44.514 --> 10:46.247
ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO

10:46.316 --> 10:47.748
CIRCUMVENT THE SYSTEM, BY

10:47.817 --> 10:48.382
POSTING CRAIGSLIST ADS, PUTTING

10:48.451 --> 10:50.318
UP SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS, OR EVEN

10:50.387 --> 10:52.587
DOING THIS.

10:52.656 --> 10:54.655

10:57.694 --> 10:58.759
REACHING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

10:58.828 --> 10:59.927

10:59.996 --> 11:03.331
THE CROSSROADS OF THE WORLD.

11:03.400 --> 11:03.931
>> John: IT'S TRUE, A MAN IN

11:04.000 --> 11:05.233
NEED OF A KIDNEY RESORTED TO

11:05.302 --> 11:06.667
PUTTING UP A GIANT BILLBOARD IN

11:06.736 --> 11:07.602
TIMES SQUARE.

11:07.671 --> 11:09.604
AND THAT IS CLEARLY NOT WHAT

11:09.673 --> 11:10.571
BILLBOARDS SHOULD BE USED FOR.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.839
THEY SHOULD BE USED TO ADVERTISE

11:11.908 --> 11:13.541
BROADWAY MUSICALS, SPORTSWEAR,

11:13.610 --> 11:14.342
OR A WEIRD BIRD THAT SOMEONE

11:14.411 --> 11:15.977
WANTS TO WIN A CONTEST ON THE

11:16.046 --> 11:16.978
OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD FOR SOME

11:17.047 --> 11:19.147
REASON.

11:19.216 --> 11:20.381
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS, THAT AD

11:20.450 --> 11:21.482
HELPED THAT MAN TO FIND A LIVING

11:21.551 --> 11:23.184
KIDNEY DONOR.

11:23.253 --> 11:24.218
BUT, AGAIN, MANY AREN'T THAT

11:24.287 --> 11:26.521
FORTUNATE.

11:26.590 --> 11:28.256
AND THE ISSUE HERE ISN'T JUST

11:28.325 --> 11:29.524
WITH ORGANS -- BECAUSE IN A

11:29.593 --> 11:30.525
COMPLETELY SEPARATE PROCESS,

11:30.594 --> 11:31.859
EACH YEAR, AROUND 20,000

11:31.928 --> 11:33.327
AMERICANS GENEROUSLY DONATE

11:33.396 --> 11:35.596
THEIR WHOLE BODIES TO SCIENCE.

11:35.665 --> 11:37.331
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS ITS OWN

11:37.400 --> 11:38.933
ISSUES, BECAUSE THE DEFINITION

11:39.002 --> 11:40.067
OF WHAT CONSTITUTES "SCIENCE"

11:40.136 --> 11:41.836
CAN BE PRETTY LOOSE.

11:41.905 --> 11:42.737
YOUR BODY COULD END UP EDUCATING

11:42.806 --> 11:44.205
MEDICAL STUDENTS.

11:44.274 --> 11:45.206
BUT IT COULD ALSO END UP

11:45.275 --> 11:48.576
SOMEWHERE LIKE THE OKLAHOMA CITY

11:48.645 --> 11:50.611
MUSEUM OF OSTEOLOGY.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.013
>> THIS IS OUR HUMAN EXHIBIT.

11:52.082 --> 11:53.147

11:53.216 --> 11:54.849
DONATE THEIR BODY TO SCIENCE,

11:54.918 --> 11:58.386
THEY COULD END UP HERE.

11:58.455 --> 11:59.020
>> IT'S POSSIBLE THEY COULD END

11:59.089 --> 12:01.589
UP HERE.

12:01.658 --> 12:02.657
>> DO YOU THINK, THOUGH, THAT

12:02.726 --> 12:03.291
PEOPLE, WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT A

12:03.360 --> 12:05.726
DONATION OF -- OF THEIR BODY TO

12:05.795 --> 12:06.761
SCIENCE, THAT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE

12:06.830 --> 12:07.528
OF THAT?

12:07.597 --> 12:08.996
>> I WOULD AUTOMATICALLY THINK

12:09.065 --> 12:10.298
IT WOULD BE, YES.

12:10.367 --> 12:10.867
>> John: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT

12:10.934 --> 12:12.533
THAT?

12:12.602 --> 12:13.568
WHEN MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT

12:13.637 --> 12:14.836
DONATING THEIR BODY TO SCIENCE,

12:14.905 --> 12:16.571
THEY PICTURE IT IN A REPUTABLE

12:16.640 --> 12:17.572
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION -- NOT

12:17.641 --> 12:19.607
IN SOME ROADSIDE BONE

12:19.676 --> 12:20.908
COLLECTION, FACE DOWN, ASS UP,

12:20.977 --> 12:22.944
ARRANGED IN A FORMATION BEST

12:23.013 --> 12:24.412

12:24.481 --> 12:25.179
PERFORMER'S FAVORITE SEX

12:25.248 --> 12:26.848
POSITION."

12:26.917 --> 12:28.649
THE FACT IS, OUR DONATED ORGANS

12:28.718 --> 12:30.518
-- WHILE BEING INCREDIBLY

12:30.587 --> 12:31.586
IMPORTANT TO SAVING LIVES -- ARE

12:31.655 --> 12:34.255
NOT GETTING INTO ENOUGH PEOPLE.

12:34.324 --> 12:34.791
AND OUR DONATED BODIES --

12:34.858 --> 12:35.291
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO

12:35.358 --> 12:37.058
ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE -- AREN'T

12:37.127 --> 12:37.658
ALWAYS TREATED WITH THE CARE

12:37.727 --> 12:39.994
THEY DESERVE.

12:40.063 --> 12:40.628
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR

12:40.697 --> 12:42.797
DONATION SYSTEMS FOR BOTH AND

12:42.866 --> 12:43.431
LET'S START WITH THE SYSTEM FOR

12:43.500 --> 12:45.700
ORGANS.

12:45.769 --> 12:46.901
ORGAN TRANSPLANTS ARE FAIRLY

12:46.970 --> 12:48.236
RECENT.

12:48.305 --> 12:49.103
THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL OPERATION

12:49.172 --> 12:50.605
ONLY TOOK PLACE IN 1954.

12:50.674 --> 12:51.639
FOR A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE, THAT

12:51.708 --> 12:52.707
WAS THE YEAR OPRAH WAS BORN.

12:52.776 --> 12:54.075
ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION IS ONLY

12:54.144 --> 12:55.109
ONE OPRAH OLD!

12:55.178 --> 12:58.746
FROM THERE, TRANSPLANTS WENT

12:58.815 --> 13:02.817
BECAME MORE COMMON.

13:02.886 --> 13:03.417
IN 1984, CONGRESS PASSED THE

13:03.486 --> 13:04.352
NATIONAL ORGAN TRANSPLANT ACT

13:04.421 --> 13:05.520
THAT BANS THE SALE OF HUMAN

13:05.589 --> 13:07.522
ORGANS, AND ACTUALLY OPENED UP

13:07.591 --> 13:08.589
ACCESS BY ESTABLISHING A

13:08.658 --> 13:09.757
NATIONAL REGISTRY FOR ORGAN

13:09.826 --> 13:11.125
MATCHING, TO BE RUN BY A PRIVATE

13:11.194 --> 13:15.363
NONPROFIT UNDER GOVERNMENT

13:15.432 --> 13:15.865
CONTRACT.

13:15.932 --> 13:16.497
AND THE ORGANIZATION THAT'S HELD

13:16.566 --> 13:19.333
IT EVER SINCE, IS CALLED UNOS,

13:19.402 --> 13:19.967
OR THE UNITED NETWORK FOR ORGAN

13:20.036 --> 13:22.336
SHARING.

13:22.405 --> 13:22.937
IT'S A NATIONAL BODY THAT SITS

13:23.006 --> 13:23.440
ATOP 56 REGIONAL "ORGAN

13:23.507 --> 13:27.175
PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATIONS"-- AND

13:27.244 --> 13:27.775
WE'LL GET INTO THEM IN A BIT.

13:27.844 --> 13:28.709
BUT UNOS ALSO MANAGES THE

13:28.778 --> 13:30.611
NATIONWIDE TRANSPLANT WAITING

13:30.680 --> 13:32.046
LIST.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.182
AND IN THIS DOCUMENTARY FROM 20

13:34.251 --> 13:34.751
YEARS AGO, THE HEAD OF UNOS

13:34.818 --> 13:35.983
EXPLAINED THE LOGISTICS THAT GO

13:36.052 --> 13:37.185
INTO DECIDING WHO GETS WHICH

13:37.254 --> 13:39.086
ORGAN.

13:39.155 --> 13:40.788
>> MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT THE

13:40.857 --> 13:42.256
WAY THE WAITING LIST WORKS IS

13:42.325 --> 13:43.724
THAT ONCE A PERSON IS ON THE

13:43.793 --> 13:45.293
LIST, THAT THEY JUST SIMPLY STAY

13:45.362 --> 13:46.461
ON THE LIST UNTIL TIME HAS

13:46.530 --> 13:47.061
PASSED AND THEY MOVE UP TO THE

13:47.130 --> 13:48.196
TOP OF THE LIST AND RECEIVE AN

13:48.265 --> 13:49.697
ORGAN.

13:49.766 --> 13:51.432
BUT IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY.

13:51.501 --> 13:52.733
IT'S A VERY DYNAMIC AND FLUID

13:52.802 --> 13:54.735
SITUATION, IN WHICH EACH PERSON

13:54.804 --> 13:57.138
IS EVALUATED BASED ON MEDICAL

13:57.207 --> 13:58.439
CRITERIA, MATCHED WITH

13:58.508 --> 13:59.974
INFORMATION THAT'S PLACED IN THE

14:00.043 --> 14:02.510
COMPUTER ABOUT EACH ORGAN DONOR.

14:02.579 --> 14:03.211
>> John: RIGHT.

14:03.280 --> 14:03.845
WHILE YOU MIGHT ASSUME THAT YOU

14:03.914 --> 14:05.313
JUST GET ON THE LIST, WAIT YOUR

14:05.382 --> 14:05.913
TURN, AN ORGAN ARRIVES FOR YOU

14:05.982 --> 14:08.349
AT THE HOSPITAL, AND A DOG EATS

14:08.418 --> 14:08.983
IT OFF THE FLOOR WHILE EVERYONE

14:09.052 --> 14:10.151
NEARBY JUST KIND OF ROLLS WITH

14:10.220 --> 14:11.586
IT, THE ACTUAL MATCHING PROCESS

14:11.655 --> 14:12.854
CHANGES CONSTANTLY BASED ON

14:12.923 --> 14:13.654
WHICH ORGANS ARE AVAILABLE AND

14:13.723 --> 14:14.255
WHICH PATIENTS MOST NEED THEM,

14:14.324 --> 14:15.423
AND IN THEORY, THAT SOUNDS

14:15.492 --> 14:19.827
AMAZING.

14:19.896 --> 14:21.529
BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS.

14:21.598 --> 14:22.363
FOR STARTERS, UNOS'S COMPUTER

14:22.432 --> 14:23.231
SYSTEMS LEAVE A LOT TO BE

14:23.300 --> 14:25.600
DESIRED.

14:25.669 --> 14:26.169
A GOVERNMENT REPORT IN 2021

14:26.236 --> 14:27.668
CITED AGED SOFTWARE, PERIODIC

14:27.737 --> 14:29.070
SYSTEM FAILURES, MISTAKES IN

14:29.139 --> 14:30.571
PROGRAMMING, AND OVERRELIANCE ON

14:30.640 --> 14:31.773
MANUAL INPUT OF DATA.

14:31.842 --> 14:34.075
INVESTIGATORS EVEN CITED

14:34.144 --> 14:35.343
MULTIPLE SYSTEM OUTAGES, WITH

14:35.412 --> 14:36.410
ONE FROM TWO YEARS AGO LASTING

14:36.479 --> 14:37.111
ABOUT THREE HOURS, WHICH ISN'T

14:37.180 --> 14:39.614
GOOD.

14:39.683 --> 14:40.548
BECAUSE EVERY MINUTE MATTERS

14:40.617 --> 14:42.116
WHEN IT COMES TO THE VIABILITY

14:42.185 --> 14:43.584
OF AN ORGAN FOR A TRANSPLANT,

14:43.653 --> 14:44.685
AND AS ANYONE WHO'S SEEN

14:44.754 --> 14:45.820
"KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON" CAN

14:45.889 --> 14:48.589
TELL YOU, THREE HOURS CAN BE AN

14:48.658 --> 14:51.092
INCREDIBLY LONG TIME.

14:51.161 --> 14:51.959
BUT IT'S NOT JUST TECHNICAL

14:52.028 --> 14:52.693
ERRORS -- THERE ARE ALSO SERIOUS

14:52.762 --> 14:54.228
ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE WAYS

14:54.297 --> 14:55.863
UNOS HAS RANKED PATIENTS IN

14:55.932 --> 14:56.831
TERMS OF NEED, MOST NOTABLY,

14:56.900 --> 14:57.799
WHEN IT COMES TO KIDNEYS.

14:57.868 --> 15:00.401
FOR YEARS, IT ALLOWED TRANSPLANT

15:00.470 --> 15:02.136
CENTERS TO EMPLOY SOMETHING

15:02.205 --> 15:03.070
CALLED A BLACK RACE COEFFICIENT.

15:03.139 --> 15:04.038
WHICH IS JUST AS BAD AS IT

15:04.107 --> 15:07.442
SOUNDS.

15:07.511 --> 15:08.643
VERY BASICALLY, HOSPITALS

15:08.712 --> 15:09.744
MISCALCULATED BLACK PATIENTS'

15:09.813 --> 15:11.312
KIDNEY FUNCTION, BASED ON RACIST

15:11.381 --> 15:12.413
JUNK SCIENCE THAT SAID BLACK

15:12.482 --> 15:13.948
BODIES HAVE HIGHER MUSCLE MASS.

15:14.017 --> 15:15.116
THAT MADE BLACK PATIENTS APPEAR

15:15.185 --> 15:19.187
HEALTHIER THAN THEY WERE,

15:19.256 --> 15:19.756
PUSHING THEM DOWN THE KIDNEY

15:19.823 --> 15:21.088
TRANSPLANT LIST, AND IT'S ONE

15:21.157 --> 15:22.490
REASON WHY -- EVEN THOUGH BLACK

15:22.559 --> 15:23.124
PEOPLE ARE FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY

15:23.193 --> 15:26.894
TO DEVELOP KIDNEY FAILURE AS

15:26.963 --> 15:27.495
WHITE PEOPLE -- THEY ARE MUCH

15:27.564 --> 15:27.997
LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE A

15:28.064 --> 15:29.197
TRANSPLANT.

15:29.266 --> 15:29.931
AND WHILE UNOS'S TRANSPLANT

15:30.000 --> 15:30.832
NETWORK DID APPROVE THE

15:30.901 --> 15:31.699
ELIMINATION OF RACE-BASED

15:31.768 --> 15:33.234
CALCULATIONS, THEY ONLY DID THAT

15:33.303 --> 15:34.469
LAST YEAR AND HAVE GIVEN

15:34.538 --> 15:35.770
HOSPITALS UNTIL JANUARY OF NEXT

15:35.839 --> 15:37.672
YEAR TO UPDATE THEIR WAITING

15:37.741 --> 15:40.875
LISTS.

15:40.944 --> 15:41.411
WHICH FEELS LIKE TOO LONG,

15:41.478 --> 15:42.743
CONSIDERING THAT THE CORRECT

15:42.812 --> 15:44.245
TIME TO FIX THAT PROBLEM IS

15:44.314 --> 15:46.647
"FUCKING AGES AGO."

15:46.716 --> 15:47.248
AND THEN THERE'S THE FACT THAT

15:47.317 --> 15:47.882
RICH PEOPLE CAN ESSENTIALLY CUT

15:47.951 --> 15:49.450
THE LINE.

15:49.519 --> 15:50.051
THE WAY THEY CAN DO THIS IS BY

15:50.120 --> 15:51.252
REGISTERING THEMSELVES AT

15:51.321 --> 15:52.887
MULTIPLE TRANSPLANT HOSPITALS IN

15:52.956 --> 15:56.424
MULTIPLE STATES, WITH THE PLAN

15:56.493 --> 15:57.024
TO FLY SOMEWHERE ON A MOMENT'S

15:57.093 --> 15:59.427
NOTICE IF ONE BECOMES AVAILABLE.

15:59.496 --> 16:00.261
IT'S CALLED "MULTIPLE LISTING,"

16:00.330 --> 16:01.762
AND IT'S HOW, IN 2009,

16:01.831 --> 16:02.563
STEVE JOBS WAS ABLE TO GET A

16:02.632 --> 16:05.967
LIVER IN A MATTER OF WEEKS IN

16:06.036 --> 16:06.503
MEMPHIS DESPITE LIVING IN

16:06.570 --> 16:07.101
CALIFORNIA, WHERE THERE WAS A

16:07.170 --> 16:09.570
LONG WAIT LIST.

16:09.639 --> 16:10.204
BUT THERE IS AN OBVIOUS REASON

16:10.273 --> 16:11.539
THAT POLICY DOESN'T WORK FOR

16:11.608 --> 16:12.807
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T BILLIONAIRE

16:12.876 --> 16:15.143
CEO'S.

16:15.212 --> 16:15.777
>> HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TOLD THAT

16:15.846 --> 16:17.445
YOU CAN BE ON MULTIPLE LISTS IN

16:17.514 --> 16:19.714
CENTERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY?

16:19.783 --> 16:19.916
>> NO.

16:19.983 --> 16:23.818
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA.

16:23.887 --> 16:24.387
>> WE EXPLAINED THE COSTS.

16:24.454 --> 16:25.019
COULD YOU AFFORD TO FLY TO THOSE

16:25.088 --> 16:29.924
PLACES?

16:29.993 --> 16:30.260
>> NO.

16:30.327 --> 16:31.359
I DON'T THINK SO.

16:31.428 --> 16:31.795
>> John: OF COURSE.

16:31.862 --> 16:33.294
BOOKING A LAST-MINUTE TICKET CAN

16:33.363 --> 16:34.529
BE REALLY EXPENSIVE, EVEN ON A

16:34.598 --> 16:36.130
CHEAP AIRLINE LIKE THE ONE WHOSE

16:36.199 --> 16:36.764
LOGO REMINDS YOU THAT THEY ONCE

16:36.833 --> 16:38.332
LOST TRACK OF A HUMAN HEART ON

16:38.401 --> 16:38.966
ONE OF THEIR GREYHOUND BUSES OF

16:39.035 --> 16:44.071
THE SKY.

16:44.140 --> 16:44.705
AND THERE'S ONE FINAL ISSUE WITH

16:44.774 --> 16:45.573
UNOS, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO ALSO

16:45.642 --> 16:48.209
COORDINATE SHIPPING OF ORGANS

16:48.278 --> 16:49.477
BETWEEN REGIONS -- FOR INSTANCE,

16:49.546 --> 16:50.378
A KIDNEY THAT MATCHES A RARE

16:50.447 --> 16:51.712
BLOOD TYPE MAY NEED TO BE FLOWN

16:51.781 --> 16:54.415
TO ANOTHER STATE.

16:54.484 --> 16:55.016
BUT EVEN THERE, IT RELIES ON A

16:55.085 --> 16:56.918
PRIMITIVE SYSTEM OF PHONE CALLS

16:56.987 --> 16:57.552
AND PAPER MANIFESTS, WITH NO GPS

16:57.621 --> 16:58.786
OR OTHER ELECTRONIC TRACKING

16:58.855 --> 17:00.688
REQUIRED.

17:00.757 --> 17:01.656
AND THAT -- COMBINED WITH

17:01.725 --> 17:02.256
FUCKUPS BY AIRLINES AND LOCAL

17:02.325 --> 17:03.357
ORGANIZATIONS -- HELPS EXPLAIN

17:03.426 --> 17:03.927
WHY NEARLY 170 ORGANS OVER A

17:03.994 --> 17:06.227
RECENT FIVE-YEAR PERIOD COULD

17:06.296 --> 17:10.364
NOT BE TRANSPLANTED DUE TO

17:10.433 --> 17:12.300
TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS.

17:12.369 --> 17:12.869
KIDNEYS HAVE SHOWN UP LATE,

17:12.936 --> 17:15.036
DAMAGED, OR -- IN ONE CASE -- IN

17:15.105 --> 17:15.937
A PACKAGE THAT WAS "SQUISHED,"

17:16.006 --> 17:19.173
WITH APPARENT TIRE MARKS ON IT.

17:19.242 --> 17:19.807
AND NO DOCTOR SHOULD HAVE TO USE

17:19.876 --> 17:22.710
A FLATTENED ORGAN.

17:22.779 --> 17:23.344
THEY'RE PERFORMING A TRANSPLANT,

17:23.413 --> 17:24.479
NOT MAKING KIDNEY PICCATA.

17:24.548 --> 17:27.648
ONE DIRECTOR OF A TRANSPLANT

17:27.717 --> 17:28.184
CENTER SUMS UP THE CURRENT

17:28.251 --> 17:30.785
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

17:30.854 --> 17:31.385
>> WHEN YOU ORDER A TOOTHBRUSH

17:31.454 --> 17:35.656
ON AMAZON, THEY CAN TELL YOU

17:35.725 --> 17:36.226
MINUTE TO MINUTE WHERE THAT

17:36.293 --> 17:39.160
TOOTHBRUSH IS.

17:39.229 --> 17:40.328
WELL, THAT'S NOT BEEN POSSIBLE

17:40.397 --> 17:44.532
FOR ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION, EVEN

17:44.601 --> 17:45.466
THOUGH WE THINK THAT WHAT WE DO

17:45.535 --> 17:47.435
IS CONSIDERABLY MORE IMPORTANT

17:47.504 --> 17:50.471
THAN ORDERING A TOOTHBRUSH.

17:50.540 --> 17:50.974
>> John: LOOK, WE SHOULD

17:51.041 --> 17:51.508
OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE TO TRACK

17:51.575 --> 17:52.075
ORGANS AS EASILY AS WE TRACK

17:52.142 --> 17:52.442
AMAZON PACKAGES.

17:52.509 --> 17:53.040
AND DO YOU REALIZE HOW SHITTY

17:53.109 --> 17:53.674
YOUR ORGANIZATION HAS TO BE FOR

17:53.743 --> 17:54.375
ME TO SAY: "BE MORE LIKE

17:54.444 --> 17:56.377
AMAZON?"

17:56.446 --> 17:56.978
THINGS HAVE TO BE PRETTY DICEY

17:57.047 --> 17:59.614
FOR ME TO LOOK INTO A CAMERA AND

17:59.683 --> 18:00.314
SAY WITH MY ACTUAL MOUTH,

18:00.383 --> 18:02.216
"PLEASE BE MORE LIKE THE

18:02.285 --> 18:02.950
SOULLESS MEGACORPORATION CREATED

18:03.019 --> 18:10.019
BY EVIL MR. CLEAN HERE."

18:10.427 --> 18:10.992
SO, TO PUT IT MILDLY, UNOS COULD

18:11.061 --> 18:14.061
AND SHOULD BE DOING A LOT

18:14.130 --> 18:14.497
BETTER.

18:14.564 --> 18:15.096
AND IT'LL SAY THAT IT HAS NEW

18:15.165 --> 18:15.730
LEADERSHIP NOW, AND THAT THEY'RE

18:15.799 --> 18:16.364
PUSHING FOR GPS TRACKING OF ALL

18:16.433 --> 18:19.467
ORGANS, WHICH IS GOOD.

18:19.536 --> 18:20.101
BUT THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN TOO

18:20.170 --> 18:21.502
LONG COMING.

18:21.571 --> 18:22.136
AND UNOS IS NOT THE ONLY PLAYER

18:22.205 --> 18:26.174
HERE.

18:26.243 --> 18:27.074
REMEMBER, THERE ARE ALSO THE 56

18:27.143 --> 18:27.742
ORGAN PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATIONS,

18:27.811 --> 18:28.876
OR OPOs.

18:28.945 --> 18:29.510
EACH OPERATES EXCLUSIVELY IN ITS

18:29.579 --> 18:31.379
REGION AND IS TASKED WITH

18:31.448 --> 18:34.382
WORKING WITH THE FAMILIES OF

18:34.451 --> 18:34.884
DONORS, FACILITATING THE

18:34.951 --> 18:36.918
RECOVERY OF ORGANS, AND

18:36.987 --> 18:37.552
COORDINATING THEIR DELIVERY TO

18:37.621 --> 18:39.387
THE TRANSPLANT HOSPITAL.

18:39.456 --> 18:40.021
AND LET ME SAY, THE JOB THEY DO

18:40.090 --> 18:41.222
IS VERY DIFFICULT.

18:41.291 --> 18:42.723
BY ONE ESTIMATE, LESS THAN 2% OF

18:42.792 --> 18:44.225
U.S. DEATHS OCCUR UNDER

18:44.294 --> 18:44.794
CIRCUMSTANCES CONDUCIVE TO

18:44.861 --> 18:46.461
DONATION -- TYPICALLY, THAT

18:46.530 --> 18:50.865
ENTAILS SOMEONE BEING DECLARED

18:50.934 --> 18:52.433
BRAIN DEAD, ON A VENTILATOR, IN

18:52.502 --> 18:53.868
A HOSPITAL, WITH OXYGEN AND

18:53.937 --> 18:56.270
BLOOD FLOWING TO THEIR ORGANS.

18:56.339 --> 18:57.872
AND OPO'S HAVE TO APPROACH

18:57.941 --> 18:58.873
FAMILIES FOR CONSENT AT A TIME

18:58.942 --> 19:00.641
WHEN THEY'RE OFTEN IN SHOCK

19:00.710 --> 19:01.943
ABOUT WHAT'S JUST HAPPENED.

19:02.012 --> 19:04.512
THAT IS CHALLENGING.

19:04.581 --> 19:05.081
ONE OPO EVEN PUT TOGETHER A

19:05.148 --> 19:06.981
TRAINING VIDEO FOR ITS WORKERS,

19:07.050 --> 19:07.615
WHERE THEY STAGED CONVERSATIONS

19:07.684 --> 19:09.050
WITH ACTORS, TO SHOW WHAT ISSUES

19:09.119 --> 19:10.218
MIGHT COME UP IN THE HEAT OF

19:10.287 --> 19:11.919
THAT DISCUSSION.

19:11.988 --> 19:12.388
AND IT IS AN ABSOLUTE

19:12.455 --> 19:17.558
ROLLER-COASTER RIDE.

19:17.627 --> 19:17.894
>> HI!

19:17.961 --> 19:18.228
GOOD MORNING.

19:18.295 --> 19:18.860
MY NAME IS --

19:18.929 --> 19:19.794
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:19.863 --> 19:20.962
I ALREADY KNOW WHO YOU ARE, AND

19:21.031 --> 19:22.096
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

19:22.165 --> 19:23.030
AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU LIKE I

19:23.099 --> 19:24.499
TOLD THE FUCKING DOCTOR.

19:24.568 --> 19:25.633
YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING HIM!

19:25.702 --> 19:26.868
WE'RE NOT DONATING SHIT!

19:26.937 --> 19:27.602
>> IF YOU JUST GIVE ME AN --

19:27.671 --> 19:28.004
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:28.071 --> 19:28.404
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.138
STOP!

19:30.207 --> 19:31.205
DO YOU SEE THIS HERE?

19:31.274 --> 19:31.806
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS RIGHT

19:31.875 --> 19:34.275
NOW?

19:34.344 --> 19:34.909
I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR OVER

19:34.978 --> 19:35.478
A WEEK!

19:35.545 --> 19:36.077
OVER A WEEK I'VE BEEN SITTING

19:36.146 --> 19:36.944
HERE WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO COME

19:37.013 --> 19:38.179
TALK TO ME.

19:38.248 --> 19:39.280
OH, WHAT?

19:39.349 --> 19:39.914
BUT NOW THAT THEY WANT SOMETHING

19:39.983 --> 19:42.016
NOW EVERYBODY WANTS TO COME TALK

19:42.085 --> 19:43.651
TO ME NOW, RIGHT?

19:43.720 --> 19:44.585
AND WHAT?

19:44.654 --> 19:45.887
THEY SENT, WHAT, THIS CHARACTER

19:45.956 --> 19:46.954
IN TO DO WHAT?

19:47.023 --> 19:48.923
CONVINCE ME!

19:48.992 --> 19:50.958
YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING MY HUSBAND.

19:51.027 --> 19:52.160
>> John: WOW.

19:52.229 --> 19:53.761
REST IN PEACE -- BOTH TO HER

19:53.830 --> 19:54.395
FICTITIOUS HUSBAND, BUT ALSO TO

19:54.464 --> 19:55.930
THAT SCENERY, WHICH JUST GOT

19:55.999 --> 19:58.566
CHEWED BY THAT ACTING

19:58.635 --> 19:59.867
POWERHOUSE.

19:59.936 --> 20:00.568
WE WATCH A LOT OF TRAINING

20:00.637 --> 20:01.602
VIDEOS FOR THIS SHOW, AND

20:01.671 --> 20:02.370
BELIEVE ME -- THAT WOMAN IS THE

20:02.439 --> 20:05.306
MERYL STREEP OF THE GENRE.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.407
JUST TO CATCH YOU UP ON THIS:

20:06.476 --> 20:07.508
THE MAN DECLARED BRAIN-DEAD IS

20:07.577 --> 20:08.376
NAMED JORGE, AND THEY'VE ONLY

20:08.445 --> 20:10.011
BEEN MARRIED FOR 2 MONTHS.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.012
THE GUY SITTING NEXT TO HER IS

20:11.081 --> 20:12.146
JORGE'S BROTHER.

20:12.215 --> 20:13.247
HE DOESN'T WANT HER MAKING

20:13.316 --> 20:14.248
DECISIONS FOR JORGE.

20:14.317 --> 20:14.849
AND HE INITIALLY DOESN'T WANT

20:14.918 --> 20:16.651
JORGE'S ORGANS DONATED EITHER,

20:16.720 --> 20:17.752
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERS THAT WHEN

20:17.821 --> 20:19.086
THEY WERE CHILDREN, THEIR MOM --

20:19.155 --> 20:20.254
WHO WAS WORKING TWO JOBS AFTER

20:20.323 --> 20:21.556
THEIR DAD LEFT -- DETAILS WE

20:21.625 --> 20:23.958
DON'T NEED, BUT GET ANYWAY!

20:24.027 --> 20:25.426
WOULD GIVE THEM EACH THEIR OWN

20:25.495 --> 20:27.028
ALLOWANCE BUT JORGE WOULD GIVE

20:27.097 --> 20:27.762
HIS TO HIS BROTHER.

20:27.831 --> 20:28.264
WHY?

20:28.331 --> 20:29.897
BECAUSE HE'S JUST THAT GIVING.

20:29.966 --> 20:31.132
AND EVENTUALLY THEY BOTH REALIZE

20:31.201 --> 20:32.500
JORGE WOULD WANT HIS ORGANS TO

20:32.569 --> 20:33.468
BE DONATED.

20:33.537 --> 20:34.335
ALL I'M SAYING IS, THERE'S A

20:34.404 --> 20:36.104
RICH BACKSTORY HERE.

20:36.173 --> 20:37.538
NOW, IS IT THE MOST GRIPPING

20:37.607 --> 20:39.073
MEDICAL DRAMA I'VE EVER SEEN?

20:39.142 --> 20:40.208
NO, AS I'VE SAID, THAT WOULD BE

20:40.277 --> 20:41.342
THIS ONE, BUT IT IS STILL

20:41.411 --> 20:44.278
UNEXPECTEDLY GOOD.

20:44.347 --> 20:44.879
NOW, A LOT OF OPOs TRY AND GET

20:44.948 --> 20:46.214
AHEAD OF CONVERSATIONS LIKE THAT

20:46.283 --> 20:47.415
BY ENCOURAGING MORE PEOPLE IN

20:47.484 --> 20:49.050
THEIR AREA TO SIGN UP AS ORGAN

20:49.119 --> 20:51.252
DONORS -- SOMETIMES THROUGH

20:51.321 --> 20:52.153
ADVERTISING, AND SOMETIMES EVEN

20:52.222 --> 20:54.856
USING MASCOTS.

20:54.925 --> 20:55.391
GIFT OF LIFE MICHIGAN HAS

20:55.458 --> 20:56.057
HARTLEY T. HART.

20:56.126 --> 20:56.691
DONATE LIFE WISCONSIN HAS DOTTIE

20:56.760 --> 21:00.228
THE DONOR DOT.

21:00.297 --> 21:00.828
DONATE LIFE ARIZONA HAS REGGIE

21:00.897 --> 21:05.433
THE DONOR CACTUS, WHO -- FROM

21:05.502 --> 21:06.067
THAT PHOTO -- SEEMS TO BE HIGH

21:06.136 --> 21:07.401
ON GLUE.

21:07.470 --> 21:07.937
AND LIFESHARE OKLAHOMA HAS

21:08.004 --> 21:08.569
DERRICK THE DONOR, WHO IS AN OIL

21:08.638 --> 21:11.239
RIG, BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THE

21:11.308 --> 21:12.206
ORGANIZATION, "OIL IS A PRECIOUS

21:12.275 --> 21:12.840
RESOURCE JUST LIKE ORGANS ARE A

21:12.909 --> 21:13.775
PRECIOUS RESOURCE."

21:13.844 --> 21:17.278
EXCEPT NO, THEY ARE NOT "JUST

21:17.347 --> 21:19.313
LIKE" EACH OTHER, OKLAHOMA.

21:19.382 --> 21:19.947
ONE OF THOSE SHOULD NOT GO INTO

21:20.016 --> 21:22.717
YOUR BODY.

21:22.786 --> 21:23.286
BESIDES, THIS IS JUST A BAD

21:23.353 --> 21:27.255
MASCOT.

21:27.324 --> 21:27.855
NO ONE'S GOING TO LOOK AT THIS

21:27.924 --> 21:28.456
AND THINK "I SHOULD SIGN UP TO

21:28.525 --> 21:32.426
DONATE MY ORGANS."

21:32.495 --> 21:32.996
THEY'LL THINK "OH, NO, THAT

21:33.063 --> 21:33.530
TELETUBBY IS SUFFOCATING!"

21:33.597 --> 21:34.996
AND BECAUSE EACH OPO IS

21:35.065 --> 21:35.630
RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING THE

21:35.699 --> 21:38.566
ORGANS IN ITS AREA, HOW WELL IT

21:38.635 --> 21:39.035
PERFORMS HAS ENORMOUS

21:39.102 --> 21:39.634
CONSEQUENCES.

21:39.703 --> 21:46.374
AND YET, UNTIL RECENTLY, THAT

21:46.443 --> 21:47.008
PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN DETERMINED

21:47.077 --> 21:51.345
BY THE OPOs THEMSELVES, SINCE

21:51.414 --> 21:51.881
THEY'VE BEEN EVALUATED ON

21:51.948 --> 21:54.715
SELF-REPORTED DATA, WHICH IS A

21:54.784 --> 21:55.051
REAL PROBLEM.

21:55.118 --> 21:55.552
BECAUSE OPOs CAN FAIL TO

21:55.619 --> 21:56.751
RETRIEVE ORGANS FOR MANY REASONS

21:56.820 --> 21:57.385
-- FROM EXHAUSTION OF OVERWORKED

21:57.454 --> 21:59.587
STAFFERS, TO LACK OF RESOURCES.

21:59.656 --> 22:00.188
AND EMPLOYEES HAVE ADMITTED TO

22:00.257 --> 22:01.055
GAMING THE SYSTEM TO COVER UP

22:01.124 --> 22:04.392
THOSE FAILURES.

22:04.461 --> 22:04.992
JUST LISTEN TO THIS FORMER OPO

22:05.061 --> 22:07.528
EXEC.

22:07.597 --> 22:08.097
>> I USED TO WORK AT AN OPO.

22:08.164 --> 22:11.299
AND WE REPORTED FALSE NUMBERS TO

22:11.368 --> 22:11.868
MAKE IT APPEAR WE WERE DOING

22:11.935 --> 22:15.736
BETTER THAN WE WERE.

22:15.805 --> 22:17.405
IMAGINE THERE ARE 10 PEOPLE WHO

22:17.474 --> 22:18.005
DIE AND THEY ALL HAVE HEALTHY

22:18.074 --> 22:18.606
ORGANS THAT CAN SAVE SOMEONE'S

22:18.675 --> 22:23.077
LIFE.

22:23.146 --> 22:23.678
WE MIGHT LATER FALSELY REPORT

22:23.747 --> 22:27.348
THAT ONLY FOUR OR FIVE OF THOSE

22:27.417 --> 22:28.015
PEOPLE HAD HEALTHY ENOUGH ORGANS

22:28.084 --> 22:28.616
FOR DONATION AND MAKE IT LOOK

22:28.685 --> 22:29.250
LIKE WE WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN

22:29.319 --> 22:30.384
OUR RECOVERY EFFORT THAN WE

22:30.453 --> 22:31.986
WERE.

22:32.055 --> 22:32.620
IN FACT, WE MIGHT NOT EVEN VISIT

22:32.689 --> 22:35.990
ALL 10 PEOPLE.

22:36.059 --> 22:37.125
>> John: THAT IS NOT GOOD.

22:37.194 --> 22:37.758
AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU CAN NEVER

22:37.827 --> 22:40.061
LIE ABOUT DEATH.

22:40.130 --> 22:42.730
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE A GOOD LIE,

22:42.799 --> 22:43.364
LIKE WHEN ROBERT PATTINSON WENT

22:43.433 --> 22:46.400
ON TO "THE TODAY SHOW" AND SAID,

22:46.469 --> 22:47.335
THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO SEE THE

22:47.404 --> 22:48.336
CIRCUS, SOMEBODY DIED.

22:48.405 --> 22:48.838
ONE OF THE CLOWNS DIED.

22:48.905 --> 22:50.104
HIS LITTLE CAR EXPLODED.

22:50.173 --> 22:51.939
THE JOKE CAR EXPLODED ON HIM.

22:52.008 --> 22:53.174
AND THEN LATER ADMITTED "I

22:53.243 --> 22:53.775
ACTUALLY MADE THE WHOLE THING

22:53.844 --> 22:56.077
UP."

22:56.146 --> 22:56.646
THE WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE

22:56.713 --> 23:03.713
BECAUSE OF THAT FAKE CLOWN'S

23:16.433 --> 23:16.998
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, DESPITE THE

23:17.067 --> 23:19.100
STAKES BEING THIS HIGH, OPO'S

23:19.169 --> 23:19.734
HAVE VERY LITTLE INCENTIVE TO DO

23:19.803 --> 23:23.271
BETTER.

23:23.340 --> 23:23.773
THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER

23:23.840 --> 23:24.340
DECERTIFIED AN OPO FOR POOR

23:24.407 --> 23:26.307
PERFORMANCE.

23:26.376 --> 23:26.908
AND POOR PERFORMANCE CAN HAVE

23:26.977 --> 23:28.743
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE

23:28.812 --> 23:30.645
LIKE L.A. POET TONYA INGRAM, WHO

23:30.714 --> 23:31.813
DESPERATELY NEEDED A KIDNEY.

23:31.882 --> 23:32.980
SHE ACTUALLY APPEARED BEFORE

23:33.049 --> 23:34.849
CONGRESS TWO YEARS AGO TO

23:34.918 --> 23:36.717
EXPLAIN HOW HER REGION'S OPO,

23:36.786 --> 23:39.620
ONELEGACY, HAD FAILED HER.

23:39.689 --> 23:40.421
>> THE ORGAN PROCUREMENT

23:40.490 --> 23:41.622
ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES

23:41.691 --> 23:43.224
LOS ANGELES, WHERE I LIVE, IS

23:43.293 --> 23:43.858
FAILING ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL

23:43.927 --> 23:47.328
GOVERNMENT.

23:47.397 --> 23:47.929
IN FACT, IT'S ONE OF THE WORST

23:47.998 --> 23:51.766
IN THE COUNTRY.

23:51.835 --> 23:52.335
ONE ANALYSIS SHOWED IT ONLY

23:52.402 --> 23:53.401
RECOVERED 31% OF POTENTIAL ORGAN

23:53.470 --> 23:56.437
DONORS.

23:56.506 --> 23:57.038
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS

23:57.107 --> 23:58.005
DIAGNOSIS, IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE

23:58.074 --> 24:00.475
THIS IS IT, AND I WILL JUST BE

24:00.544 --> 24:02.877
WAITING FOREVER UNTIL I'M NO

24:02.946 --> 24:04.946
LONGER HERE.

24:05.015 --> 24:05.913
>> John: THAT IS AWFUL.

24:05.982 --> 24:07.248
AND TO MAKE IT WORSE THE

24:07.317 --> 24:08.950
THEN-CEO OF ONELEGACY,

24:09.019 --> 24:10.952
TOM MONE, WROTE HER AN EMAIL,

24:11.021 --> 24:12.086
DEFENDING THE JOB HE'D DONE, AND

24:12.155 --> 24:12.954
SUGGESTING THAT THE "NUMBER ONE

24:13.023 --> 24:14.455
THING" SHE COULD DO TO "IMPROVE

24:14.524 --> 24:15.356
YOUR CHANCES AND YOUR

24:15.425 --> 24:17.158
COMMUNITY'S CHANCES OF A

24:17.227 --> 24:18.759
LIFE-SAVING TRANSPLANT IS TO

24:18.828 --> 24:21.262
REGISTER AS A DONOR AND HELP

24:21.331 --> 24:24.999
PEOPLE IN YOUR ETHNIC GROUP, IN

24:25.068 --> 24:25.633
PARTICULAR, TO CHOOSE TO DONATE

24:25.702 --> 24:26.367
LIFE."

24:26.436 --> 24:27.835
AND IF YOU'RE EVER TYPING THE

24:27.904 --> 24:29.737
PHRASE "YOUR ETHNIC GROUP" INTO

24:29.806 --> 24:30.705
AN EMAIL, CLIPPY SHOULD JUST

24:30.774 --> 24:31.305
APPEAR AND SAY "NO, STOP WHAT

24:31.374 --> 24:33.574
YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW."

24:33.643 --> 24:34.144
AND I HAVE TO SAY, ONELEGACY

24:34.211 --> 24:41.211
SAYS THEY ARE DEEPLY REGRETFUL

24:42.519 --> 24:43.284
FOR THE EMAIL, WHICH THEY WANT

24:43.353 --> 24:43.820
YOU TO KNOW WAS A PERSONAL

24:43.887 --> 24:45.086
COMMUNICATION FROM TOM MONE.

24:45.155 --> 24:45.720
VERY MUCH THROWING HIM UNDER THE

24:45.789 --> 24:47.688
BUS LIKE A KIDNEY IN A BOX.

24:47.757 --> 24:48.322
BUT AT THIS POINT, IT SHOULD BE

24:48.391 --> 24:49.991
CLEAR: OUR SYSTEM OF MANAGING

24:50.060 --> 24:50.591
DONATED ORGANS IS NOWHERE NEAR

24:50.660 --> 24:52.994
WHERE IT SHOULD BE.

24:53.063 --> 24:53.628
BUT DEPRESSINGLY, IT'S ACTUALLY

24:53.697 --> 24:55.830
A PARAGON OF CARE AND

24:55.899 --> 24:57.298
THOUGHTFULNESS COMPARED TO WHAT

24:57.367 --> 24:57.867
HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE DONATES

24:57.934 --> 25:00.034
THEIR BODY TO SCIENCE.

25:00.103 --> 25:00.603
WHICH BRING US TO WHOLE BODY

25:00.670 --> 25:02.970
DONATION.

25:03.039 --> 25:03.540
THAT'S A CHOICE THOUSANDS OF

25:03.607 --> 25:04.172
AMERICANS MAKE EVERY YEAR,

25:04.241 --> 25:05.606
EITHER FOR THEMSELVES, OR WHEN A

25:05.675 --> 25:07.241
LOVED ONE'S ORGANS AREN'T

25:07.310 --> 25:08.776
SUITABLE FOR DONATION.

25:08.845 --> 25:10.478
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO

25:10.547 --> 25:12.313
BOTH SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND

25:12.382 --> 25:13.948
MEDICAL TRAINING, AS THIS

25:14.017 --> 25:16.150
MED-SCHOOL VIDEO WILL ATTEST.

25:16.219 --> 25:17.485
>> THE BEAUTY AND COMPLEXITY OF

25:17.554 --> 25:19.787
THE HUMAN BODY CAN REALLY ONLY

25:19.856 --> 25:22.256
BE TAUGHT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

25:22.325 --> 25:23.691
STUDYING AN ANATOMICAL DONOR.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.461
DONATIONS PROVIDE A TACTILE

25:26.530 --> 25:27.030
SENSE OF LEARNING AND REALLY

25:27.097 --> 25:29.530
HIGHLIGHT THE VARIATION AMONGST

25:29.599 --> 25:31.365
HUMAN BEINGS IN A WAY THAT

25:31.434 --> 25:34.902
VIRTUAL REALITY JUST CAN'T YET.

25:34.971 --> 25:35.770
>> I THINK THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS

25:35.839 --> 25:36.537
PEOPLE TO PRACTICE AND TO LEARN

25:36.606 --> 25:40.475
IN A WAY THAT WILL REALLY HELP

25:40.544 --> 25:43.578
THEIR FUTURE PATIENTS.

25:43.647 --> 25:44.212
>> John: EXACTLY, DONATIONS TO

25:44.281 --> 25:44.846
SCIENCE CAN HELP DOCTORS BETTER

25:44.915 --> 25:45.913
UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN BODY.

25:45.982 --> 25:47.215
FOR EXAMPLE, IF I DONATED MY

25:47.284 --> 25:51.352
BODY, MAYBE THEY COULD FIGURE

25:51.421 --> 25:53.688
OUT HOW A MAN CAN AGE 47 YEARS

25:53.757 --> 25:54.455
IN A SINGLE DECADE.

25:54.524 --> 25:57.125
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT SHOULD

25:57.194 --> 25:58.893
BE BIOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE.

25:58.962 --> 26:01.162
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BE FINE.

26:01.231 --> 26:02.063
I'M GOING TO LIVE FOREVER.

26:02.132 --> 26:03.030
AND IN THEORY, THAT'S GREAT.

26:03.099 --> 26:04.232
UNFORTUNATELY, IN PRACTICE, YOU

26:04.301 --> 26:04.801
MIGHT NOT END UP IN FRONT OF

26:04.868 --> 26:07.235
MEDICAL STUDENTS.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.937
INSTEAD YOU COULD END UP HERE.

26:10.006 --> 26:12.240
>> ON A BRIGHT SUNDAY MORNING IN

26:12.309 --> 26:12.840
PORTLAND EARLIER THIS MONTH.

26:12.909 --> 26:14.075
>> THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT DONATED

26:14.144 --> 26:19.981
THEIR BODY TO SCIENCE.

26:20.050 --> 26:23.317
>> A FEW DOZEN PEOPLE SPENT THE

26:23.386 --> 26:24.218
DAY INSIDE AT THIS DOWNTOWN

26:24.287 --> 26:24.420
HOTEL.

26:24.487 --> 26:25.720
THEY PAID UP TO $500 A SEAT IN

26:25.789 --> 26:27.121
THE BALLROOM TO SIT UP CLOSE TO

26:27.190 --> 26:27.755
THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE DRAPED IN

26:27.824 --> 26:29.557
A WHITE SHEET.

26:29.626 --> 26:30.158
>> I HEARD ABOUT IT THROUGH A

26:30.227 --> 26:30.758
FRIEND, DECIDED TO BROADEN MY

26:30.827 --> 26:31.893
EXPERIENCES.

26:31.962 --> 26:32.760
>> THE SHEET COMES OFF, EXPOSING

26:32.829 --> 26:33.494
THE CORPSE OF AN 86-YEAR-OLD

26:33.563 --> 26:36.531
MAN.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.732
THIS IN-PERSON, PAY-PER-VIEW

26:37.801 --> 26:38.432
EVENT PUTS REGULAR PEOPLE,

26:38.501 --> 26:40.802
PAYING CUSTOMERS, WITHIN AN

26:40.871 --> 26:41.337
ARM'S LENGTH OF SOMETHING

26:41.404 --> 26:41.969
USUALLY RESERVED FOR DOCTORS AND

26:42.038 --> 26:48.176
SCIENTISTS.

26:48.245 --> 26:48.711
>> John: OKAY, CLEARLY, A

26:48.778 --> 26:49.245
MARRIOTT HOTEL AUTOPSY IS

26:49.312 --> 26:51.345
STRETCHING THE DEFINITION OF

26:51.414 --> 26:51.848
"SCIENCE."

26:51.915 --> 26:52.647
AND NOT TO GET SIDETRACKED, BUT

26:52.716 --> 26:53.815
DID THAT GUY SAY HE HEARD ABOUT

26:53.884 --> 26:56.684
IT THROUGH A FRIEND?

26:56.753 --> 26:57.253
BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY

26:57.320 --> 26:58.920
THAT CONVERSATION SHOULD GO:

26:58.989 --> 27:00.955
YOUR FRIEND SAYS, "HEY, WANNA GO

27:01.024 --> 27:02.156
TO A LIVE AUTOPSY?"

27:02.225 --> 27:04.225
TO WHICH YOU REPLY, "I'M

27:04.294 --> 27:04.461
SORRY...

27:04.528 --> 27:05.059
WHAT?"

27:05.128 --> 27:05.693
TO WHICH HE SAYS, "YEAH, THEY'RE

27:05.762 --> 27:06.360
DISSECTING A BODY!"

27:06.429 --> 27:06.994
TO WHICH YOU SAY, "WHAT KIND OF

27:07.063 --> 27:07.762
ANIMAL?"

27:07.831 --> 27:09.230
TO WHICH HE SAYS, "NO, IT'S A

27:09.299 --> 27:10.498
HUMAN MAN!"

27:10.567 --> 27:11.265
TO WHICH YOU RESPOND, "WHY WOULD

27:11.334 --> 27:13.401
ANYONE GO ALL THE WAY TO A

27:13.470 --> 27:13.970
MEDICAL SCHOOL TO WATCH -- "

27:14.037 --> 27:14.836
TO WHICH HE INTERRUPTS WITH, "OH

27:14.905 --> 27:17.238
NO!

27:17.307 --> 27:17.839
IT'S NOT AT A MEDICAL SCHOOL,

27:17.908 --> 27:18.374
IT'S IN THE BALLROOM OF A

27:18.441 --> 27:18.973
MARRIOTT IN DOWNTOWN PORTLAND.

27:19.042 --> 27:19.607
BUT WE HAVE TO BE OUT BY THREE,

27:19.676 --> 27:22.410
THERE'S A QUINCEANERA."

27:22.479 --> 27:23.778
TO WHICH YOU REPLY, "WAIT, WHAT

27:23.847 --> 27:23.980
NOW?"

27:24.047 --> 27:25.713
TO WHICH HE SAYS, "YEAH, AND

27:25.782 --> 27:26.249
IT'S ONLY $500 TO GET IN."

27:26.316 --> 27:26.816
TO WHICH YOUR ONLY RESPONSE

27:26.883 --> 27:27.448
SHOULD BE, "I'LL PAY $500 RIGHT

27:27.517 --> 27:31.119
NOW, FOR YOU TO NEVER SPEAK TO

27:31.188 --> 27:31.387
ME AGAIN.

27:31.454 --> 27:31.921
THIS FRIENDSHIP IS OVER."

27:31.988 --> 27:38.226
AND I WILL SAY: THE EXPLANATION

27:38.295 --> 27:38.826
OFFERED BY THE MAN WHO HOSTED

27:38.895 --> 27:41.596
THAT EVENT WASN'T GREAT.

27:41.665 --> 27:42.363
>> THE BODY BUYER,

27:42.432 --> 27:45.833
DeathScience.org, IS RUN BY

27:45.902 --> 27:46.402
JEREMY CILIBERTO, WHO HAS NO

27:46.469 --> 27:47.401
PROFESSIONAL CREDENTIALS.

27:47.470 --> 27:48.336
IT WAS CILIBERTO WHO BROUGHT THE

27:48.405 --> 27:49.771
PORTLAND BODY SHOW TO LIFE AND

27:49.840 --> 27:52.173
HAD PLANNED ONE FOR SEATTLE AS

27:52.242 --> 27:56.210
WELL ON HALLOWEEN DAY.

27:56.279 --> 27:56.746
CAN YOU GUARANTEE THEY HAD

27:56.813 --> 27:57.378
KNOWLEDGE THAT HE KNEW THAT HIS

27:57.447 --> 27:59.647
BODY WOULD BE USED IN THIS WAY?

27:59.716 --> 28:01.215
>> I CAN GUARANTEE THAT HE KNEW

28:01.284 --> 28:03.918
HIS BODY WOULD BE USED FOR

28:03.987 --> 28:06.854
MEDICAL EDUCATION.

28:06.923 --> 28:08.823
>> John: OH, BULLSHIT.

28:08.892 --> 28:09.557
AND I'VE GOTTA SAY, I'M NOT

28:09.626 --> 28:11.626
SURPRISED THAT THAT LONG-LOST

28:11.695 --> 28:13.661
MEMBER OF "MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE"

28:13.730 --> 28:15.062
DOESN'T HAVE ANY MEDICAL

28:15.131 --> 28:17.999
CREDENTIALS.

28:18.068 --> 28:18.599
BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN

28:18.668 --> 28:19.135
WHY HE'S SOMEHOW PROVIDING

28:19.202 --> 28:20.768
"MEDICAL EDUCATION."

28:20.837 --> 28:22.236
AND YET, THAT'S TOTALLY LEGAL.

28:22.305 --> 28:22.772
BECAUSE BODIES DONATED TO

28:22.839 --> 28:27.175
SCIENCE ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD IN A

28:27.244 --> 28:27.775
VIRTUALLY UNREGULATED MARKET.

28:27.844 --> 28:28.409
THERE IS NO FEDERAL LAW, AND NO

28:28.478 --> 28:29.644
GOVERNMENT AGENCY MONITORS WHAT

28:29.713 --> 28:30.978
HAPPENS TO CADAVERS PLEDGED FOR

28:31.047 --> 28:31.548
USE IN MEDICAL RESEARCH AND

28:31.615 --> 28:36.284
EDUCATION.

28:36.353 --> 28:36.686
THERE ARE ALSO NO

28:36.753 --> 28:37.919
GOVERNMENT-MANDATED NONPROFITS

28:37.988 --> 28:38.586
HERE, INSTEAD THERE ARE

28:38.655 --> 28:40.688
FOR-PROFIT COMPANIES KNOWN AS

28:40.757 --> 28:41.889
BODY BROKERS -- OR, AS THEY

28:41.958 --> 28:43.491
PREFER TO BE CALLED,

28:43.560 --> 28:44.826
"NON-TRANSPLANT TISSUE BANKS" --

28:44.895 --> 28:46.594
WHO VERY LITERALLY SELL BODIES

28:46.663 --> 28:47.695
OFF FOR PARTS.

28:47.764 --> 28:48.963
ONE OF THE FEW RULES THAT EVEN

28:49.032 --> 28:50.898
APPLIES TO THEM IS A STATUTE

28:50.967 --> 28:52.967
ADOPTED IN 47 STATES CALLED THE

28:53.036 --> 28:54.936
UNIFORM ANATOMICAL GIFT ACT THAT

28:55.005 --> 28:55.770
REQUIRES DONORS MUST PROVIDE

28:55.839 --> 28:59.107
INFORMED CONSENT, WITH THOSE

28:59.176 --> 28:59.740
AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY STIPULATING

28:59.809 --> 29:01.476
THAT THE BODY WILL BE USED FOR

29:01.545 --> 29:02.810
RESEARCH AND EDUCATION.

29:02.879 --> 29:03.346
BUT "MEDICAL RESEARCH AND

29:03.413 --> 29:03.880
EDUCATION" IS NOT CLEARLY

29:03.947 --> 29:06.948
DEFINED.

29:07.017 --> 29:09.350
AND, AS YOU JUST SAW, THAT CAN

29:09.419 --> 29:09.984
TECHNICALLY MEAN THAT YOUR BODY

29:10.053 --> 29:12.286
MIGHT BE CARVED UP IN A MARRIOTT

29:12.355 --> 29:12.920
FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF A GROWN

29:12.989 --> 29:14.889
MAN IN A FEDORA.

29:14.958 --> 29:18.526
AND EVEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO

29:18.595 --> 29:19.028
SUPPLY BODIES TO MEDICAL

29:19.095 --> 29:19.994
SCHOOLS, LIKE ILLINOIS'

29:20.063 --> 29:22.763
ANATOMICAL GIFT ASSOCIATION, CAN

29:22.832 --> 29:24.332
CONDUCT THEMSELVES POORLY.

29:24.401 --> 29:24.932
IT WAS ACCUSED BY ONE EMPLOYEE

29:25.001 --> 29:26.367
OF MISHANDLING AND MISTREATING

29:26.436 --> 29:27.235
BODIES -- LEAVING SOME ROTTING

29:27.304 --> 29:28.202
OR BEING EATEN BY RATS.

29:28.271 --> 29:31.572
WHICH IS HORRIFIC.

29:31.641 --> 29:32.108
RATS SHOULDN'T BE HUNGRILY

29:32.175 --> 29:34.442
DEVOURING HUMAN BODIES; THEY

29:34.511 --> 29:35.143
SHOULD BE HUNGRILY DEVOURING

29:35.212 --> 29:38.679
EACH OTHERS BODIES -- I THINK

29:38.748 --> 29:41.349
WE'VE MADE THAT PRETTY CLEAR.

29:41.418 --> 29:44.185
AND WHILE THE AGA SAID THAT IT

29:44.254 --> 29:44.754
STRONGLY DISAGREED WITH THE

29:44.821 --> 29:45.820
EMPLOYEE'S ALLEGATIONS OF

29:45.889 --> 29:47.388
MISTREATMENT, THAT EMPLOYEE ALSO

29:47.457 --> 29:49.090
SAYS THAT HE WAS PUNISHED FOR

29:49.159 --> 29:50.324
SPEAKING OUT, AND IN THE

29:50.393 --> 29:51.793
GROSSEST POSSIBLE WAY.

29:51.862 --> 29:55.830
>> MR. WHEATLEY SAYS THAT WHEN

29:55.899 --> 29:58.232
HE APPROACHED HIS SUPERVISORS

29:58.301 --> 29:59.133
WITH HIS CONCERNS ABOUT

29:59.202 --> 30:00.168
PROCEDURES, THREE DISMEMBERED

30:00.237 --> 30:03.304
HEADS FROM DONATED BODIES WERE

30:03.373 --> 30:04.138
LEFT AT HIS DESK.

30:04.207 --> 30:05.006
>> MY BOSS WALKED BY.

30:05.075 --> 30:07.008
I ASKED HIM WHY THE HEADS WERE

30:07.077 --> 30:09.544
AT MY DESK, AND HE TOLD ME THEY

30:09.613 --> 30:10.745
NEEDED TO GET BACK WITH THEIR

30:10.814 --> 30:11.612
BODIES SO WE CAN SEND THEM TO

30:11.681 --> 30:12.380
CREMATION.

30:12.449 --> 30:14.315
AND I SAID, "I UNDERSTAND THAT.

30:14.384 --> 30:16.217
WHY ARE THEY AT MY DESK?"

30:16.286 --> 30:17.618
AND HE TOLD ME, "WELL, I DON'T

30:17.687 --> 30:18.686
KNOW, DALE.

30:18.755 --> 30:20.221
THERE'S A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS

30:20.290 --> 30:22.089
HAPPENING."

30:22.158 --> 30:24.625
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

30:24.694 --> 30:25.493
"I DON'T KNOW, DALE.

30:25.562 --> 30:26.127
THERE'S A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS

30:26.196 --> 30:28.496
HAPPENING?"

30:28.565 --> 30:29.197
IF YOU'RE BOLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE

30:29.266 --> 30:31.299
SEVERED HEADS AT SOMEONE'S DESK,

30:31.368 --> 30:34.802
WHY BE PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE?

30:34.871 --> 30:35.305
EITHER YOU'RE A DIRECT

30:35.372 --> 30:35.872
COMMUNICATOR OR YOU'RE NOT!

30:35.939 --> 30:38.840
PICK A FUCKING LANE.

30:38.909 --> 30:39.707
AND BODY BROKERS WILL SOMETIMES

30:39.776 --> 30:40.808
MAKE ATTRACTIVE PITCHES TO

30:40.877 --> 30:42.677
OBTAIN BODIES.

30:42.746 --> 30:43.644
STRUGGLING FAMILIES MIGHT BE

30:43.713 --> 30:45.546
TOLD THEY'LL RECEIVE A CREMATED

30:45.615 --> 30:47.014
PORTION OF THEIR LOVED ONE, FREE

30:47.083 --> 30:48.816
OF CHARGE.

30:48.885 --> 30:49.917
OTHER TIMES, FAMILIES MIGHT BE

30:49.986 --> 30:51.052
TOLD THEIR LOVED ONE'S BODY WILL

30:51.121 --> 30:52.420
BE USED TO RESEARCH THE EXACT

30:52.489 --> 30:54.122
CONDITION THEY DIED FROM.

30:54.191 --> 30:55.656
WHICH IS A LOVELY IDEA, BUT IT'S

30:55.725 --> 30:57.925
JUST NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.

30:57.994 --> 30:59.127
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH

30:59.196 --> 31:01.028
CODY SAUNDERS, WHO DIED AT AGE

31:01.097 --> 31:03.231
24 FROM A RARE DISEASE, AND I'LL

31:03.300 --> 31:03.800
LET HIS MOTHER EXPLAIN WHAT

31:03.867 --> 31:06.100
HAPPENED NEXT.

31:06.169 --> 31:07.168
>> WE COULDN'T AFFORD A BURIAL

31:07.237 --> 31:07.835
FOR CODY.

31:07.904 --> 31:09.203
>> CODY'S MOM, ANGIE, SAYS

31:09.272 --> 31:11.806
SOMEONE TOLD HER ABOUT A COMPANY

31:11.875 --> 31:13.908
THAT COULD HELP.

31:13.977 --> 31:14.477
RESTORE LIFE USA OFFERED TO

31:14.544 --> 31:19.013
HANDLE ALL OF THE EXPENSES IN

31:19.082 --> 31:19.549
EXCHANGE FOR USING SOME OF

31:19.616 --> 31:21.549
CODY'S BODY FOR MEDICAL

31:21.618 --> 31:22.216
RESEARCH.

31:22.285 --> 31:22.950
>> ALL I REMEMBER IS THEY WERE

31:23.019 --> 31:23.551
SUPPOSED TO TAKE SKIN CELLS SO

31:23.620 --> 31:30.258
THEY COULD FIGURE OUT -- MAYBE

31:30.327 --> 31:30.858
THEY COULD FIGURE OUT THAT --

31:30.927 --> 31:34.462
WHAT CAUSED THIS DISEASE.

31:34.531 --> 31:35.062
>> John: YOU CAN SEE WHY THAT

31:35.131 --> 31:36.998
WOULD BE SO APPEALING FOR HER.

31:37.067 --> 31:37.632
AND WHY IT MAKES IT SO UPSETTING

31:37.701 --> 31:41.669
THAT, A MONTH AFTER CODY DIED, A

31:41.738 --> 31:43.104
REPORTER FROM REUTERS BOUGHT HER

31:43.173 --> 31:44.639
SON'S CERVICAL SPINE FOR $300,

31:44.708 --> 31:45.373
PLUS SHIPPING, FROM THAT

31:45.442 --> 31:47.842
COMPANY.

31:47.911 --> 31:48.476
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "HOW THE

31:48.545 --> 31:49.410
FUCK WAS THAT ALLOWED TO

31:49.479 --> 31:50.378
HAPPEN?"

31:50.447 --> 31:53.147
WELL, IN ALMOST EVERY STATE,

31:53.216 --> 31:54.415
IT'S LEGAL TO SELL THE HUMAN

31:54.484 --> 31:56.184
REMAINS OF ADULTS.

31:56.253 --> 31:56.951
THERE ARE MULTIPLE WEBSITES

31:57.020 --> 31:58.653
WHERE YOU CAN BUY HUMAN BONES.

31:58.722 --> 32:00.288
SKULLS UNLIMITED -- WHICH IS

32:00.357 --> 32:00.922
ACTUALLY THE COMPANY THAT OWNED

32:00.991 --> 32:03.691
THAT BONE MUSEUM YOU SAW

32:03.760 --> 32:04.325
EARLIER, SELLS SKELETONS THAT IT

32:04.394 --> 32:05.960
GUARANTEES ARE ANTIQUES --

32:06.029 --> 32:07.228
D■ECADES-OLD HUMAN BONES ONC

32:07.297 --> 32:07.797
USED IN PLACES LIKE MEDICAL

32:07.864 --> 32:10.531
SCHOOLS.

32:10.600 --> 32:11.966
BUT UNDER MOST STATES' LAWS,

32:12.035 --> 32:13.267
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE.

32:13.336 --> 32:17.905
AND THEY'LL SELL YOU A HUMAN

32:17.974 --> 32:19.006
SKULL FOR $2,200, OR A RIB FOR

32:19.075 --> 32:21.109
$40.

32:21.178 --> 32:23.044
YOU CAN EVEN BUY HUMAN TEETH FOR

32:23.113 --> 32:23.945
$35 A POP.

32:24.014 --> 32:25.746
WHICH IS A PRETTY GREAT DEAL.

32:25.815 --> 32:27.515
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

32:27.584 --> 32:29.117
WE BOUGHT TWO DOZEN OF THEM!

32:29.186 --> 32:31.119
EXCEPT OF COURSE WE DIDN'T,

32:31.188 --> 32:31.621
RELAX, WE'RE NOT FUCKING

32:31.688 --> 32:34.555
MONSTERS!

32:34.624 --> 32:36.090
BUT WE COULD HAVE DONE IT IF WE

32:36.159 --> 32:36.791
WANTED TO, AND I'M VERY

32:36.860 --> 32:38.659
DISAPPOINTED BY HOW MANY PEOPLE

32:38.728 --> 32:40.761
IN THIS ROOM SEEMED GENUINELY

32:40.830 --> 32:41.762
WORRIED THAT WE MIGHT'VE DONE

32:41.831 --> 32:42.830
THAT!

32:42.899 --> 32:49.899
UNBELIEVABLE!

32:53.343 --> 32:53.810
AND YOU MIGHT BE

32:53.877 --> 32:54.442
THINKING, "THIS WHOLE STORY HAS

32:54.511 --> 32:54.978
HORRIFIED ME SO MUCH, I'M

32:55.045 --> 32:55.610
KEEPING EVERYTHING INSIDE ME AND

32:55.679 --> 32:56.179
I'M TAKING IT TO MY GRAVE."

32:56.246 --> 32:56.746
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

32:56.813 --> 32:57.812
REITERATE JUST HOW MEANINGFUL

32:57.881 --> 32:58.412
ORGAN DONATION, IN PARTICULAR,

32:58.481 --> 32:59.781
CAN BE.

32:59.850 --> 33:01.249
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED TO

33:01.318 --> 33:02.950
ALYSSA SANDEEN, WHO WOULD HAVE

33:03.019 --> 33:04.118
DIED WITHOUT A HEART TRANSPLANT.

33:04.187 --> 33:04.719
AND TEN YEARS AGO, ONE BECAME

33:04.788 --> 33:06.988
AVAILABLE, AFTER THIS

33:07.057 --> 33:08.122
20-YEAR-OLD, KATE LEAKLY, WAS

33:08.191 --> 33:08.691
TRAGICALLY KILLED BY A DRUNK

33:08.758 --> 33:10.158
DRIVER.

33:10.227 --> 33:10.758
THAT TRANSPLANT SAVED ALYSSA'S

33:10.827 --> 33:14.362
LIFE.

33:14.431 --> 33:14.962
AND A FEW YEARS LATER, ALYSSA

33:15.031 --> 33:15.797
MET KATE'S FAMILY, AND THE

33:15.866 --> 33:18.933
RESULT WAS INCREDIBLY MOVING.

33:19.002 --> 33:19.567
>> ALYSSA DECIDED TO MEET KATE'S

33:19.636 --> 33:20.868
FAMILY.

33:20.937 --> 33:21.502
OVER THE WEEKEND, THEY MADE THE

33:21.571 --> 33:24.071
DRIVE TO ILLINOIS.

33:24.140 --> 33:24.641
WHEN THEY GOT THERE, KATE'S

33:24.708 --> 33:26.507
PARENTS AND SISTER WERE WAITING.

33:26.576 --> 33:28.776
FINALLY, TWO FAMILIES BONDED BY

33:28.845 --> 33:35.116
A SPECIAL GIFT MET FACE TO FACE.

33:35.185 --> 33:36.784
>> IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

33:36.853 --> 33:38.152
>> ALYSSA CAME WITH HER OWN

33:38.221 --> 33:40.054
GIFT, A STUFFED TEDDY BEAR FOR

33:40.123 --> 33:44.559
THE MOTHER TO KEEP WITH A SOUND.

33:44.628 --> 33:45.193
>> SO, THEY MADE A RECORDING OF

33:45.262 --> 33:50.097
MY HEARTBEAT WITH A STETHOSCOPE,

33:50.166 --> 33:50.698
AND WE DECIDED TO GIVE THAT TO

33:50.767 --> 33:51.666
HER SO SHE CAN KEEP HER

33:51.735 --> 33:55.903
DAUGHTER'S HEART WITH HER.

33:55.972 --> 33:56.372
THAT'S YOUR DAUGHTER'S

33:56.439 --> 34:01.008
HEARTBEAT.

34:01.077 --> 34:05.146
>> JUST TO HEAR HER HEARTBEAT, I

34:05.215 --> 34:06.714
CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

34:06.783 --> 34:07.982
>> John: THAT IS AMAZING.

34:08.051 --> 34:10.151
AND LET'S ALL AGREE, ALYSSA

34:10.220 --> 34:10.720
ABSOLUTELY NAILED THAT GIFT.

34:10.787 --> 34:11.552
THAT'S ABOUT AS THOUGHTFUL AS

34:11.621 --> 34:17.792
GIFT-GIVING GETS.

34:17.861 --> 34:18.926
IT'S CERTAINLY BETTER THAN WHAT

34:18.995 --> 34:19.527
I WOULD HAVE DONE: DESPERATELY

34:19.596 --> 34:20.261
LOOK AT HALLMARK CARDS AND THEN

34:20.330 --> 34:21.162
ACCIDENTALLY BUY ONE THAT SAYS

34:21.231 --> 34:22.730
"HAPPY GRADUATION."

34:22.799 --> 34:24.632
THE POINT IS, WE ALL KNOW

34:24.701 --> 34:25.933
DONATING ORGANS SAVES LIVES.

34:26.002 --> 34:29.570
AND GIVING YOUR BODY TO SCIENCE

34:29.639 --> 34:31.472
CAN SAVE AND ENHANCE THEM, TOO.

34:31.541 --> 34:32.240
BUT WHAT WE CURRENTLY DO WITH

34:32.309 --> 34:35.143
THOSE GIFTS IS BROKEN.

34:35.212 --> 34:36.377
FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING

34:36.446 --> 34:38.379
WAITING FOR ORGANS THAT COULD BE

34:38.448 --> 34:39.213
COMING, BUT AREN'T.

34:39.282 --> 34:40.448
AND ONE OF THEM, SADLY, IS

34:40.517 --> 34:42.083
TONYA INGRAM, WHO DIED LAST

34:42.152 --> 34:43.551
YEAR, NEVER HAVING GOTTEN THE

34:43.620 --> 34:45.086
TRANSPLANT THAT SHE WAS WAITING

34:45.155 --> 34:46.687
FOR.

34:46.756 --> 34:48.189
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

34:48.258 --> 34:49.457
WELL, FOR ORGANS, WE NEED TO

34:49.526 --> 34:50.958
RAISE THE STANDARDS OF HOW THE

34:51.027 --> 34:51.959
SYSTEM OPERATES.

34:52.028 --> 34:53.194
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME GOOD

34:53.263 --> 34:54.595
NEWS ON THAT FRONT FROM -- AND I

34:54.664 --> 34:55.997
CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ABOUT TO SAY

34:56.066 --> 34:56.399
THIS -- THE TRUMP

34:56.466 --> 34:59.233
ADMINISTRATION.

34:59.302 --> 35:01.035
IT ACTUALLY PUT A RULE IN PLACE

35:01.104 --> 35:01.504
THAT PROVIDES AN

35:01.571 --> 35:03.037
OBJECTIVE-RATHER THAN

35:03.106 --> 35:04.305
SELF-REPORTED-METRIC FOR

35:04.374 --> 35:07.208
MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF

35:07.277 --> 35:07.744
OPOs.

35:07.811 --> 35:08.376
AND STARTING IN 2026, OPOs WHO

35:08.445 --> 35:08.976
FALL BELOW A CERTAIN STANDARD,

35:09.045 --> 35:11.979
WILL LOSE THEIR CONTRACT.

35:12.048 --> 35:12.580
IT'S ONE OF EXACTLY TWO GOOD

35:12.649 --> 35:13.915
THINGS WE GOT FROM THE TRUMP

35:13.984 --> 35:14.816
ADMINISTRATION, ALONGSIDE THIS

35:14.885 --> 35:17.318
SPECTACULAR GAY RABBIT.

35:17.387 --> 35:18.653
NOW, THAT NEW RULE IS NOT

35:18.722 --> 35:20.288
PERFECT.

35:20.357 --> 35:22.557
SOME EXPERTS WORRY THE STANDARDS

35:22.626 --> 35:23.691
MIGHT PUNISH GOOD OPOs BY NOT

35:23.760 --> 35:25.059
PROPERLY ADJUSTING FOR THINGS

35:25.128 --> 35:26.227
THAT AREN'T IN THEIR CONTROL,

35:26.296 --> 35:28.196
WHILE ALSO ALLOWING STRUGGLING

35:28.265 --> 35:28.830
OPOs AN OPPORTUNITY TO GAME THE

35:28.899 --> 35:30.665
SYSTEM.

35:30.734 --> 35:32.266
ONE PARTICULAR WORRY IS THE

35:32.335 --> 35:33.768
SO-CALLED "PANCREAS EXCEPTION,"

35:33.837 --> 35:34.402
WHICH LETS OPOs CLAIM CREDIT FOR

35:34.471 --> 35:36.471
PANCREASES THAT AREN'T

35:36.540 --> 35:37.105
TRANSPLANTED, BUT ARE RECOVERED

35:37.174 --> 35:40.074
FOR RESEARCH.

35:40.143 --> 35:41.409
IT'S NOT A GREAT SIGN THAT ONE

35:41.478 --> 35:43.978
UNDERPERFORMING OPO IN OHIO,

35:44.047 --> 35:44.745
LIFEBANC, WENT FROM RECOVERING

35:44.814 --> 35:47.815
ONE PANCREAS FOR RESEARCH THE

35:47.884 --> 35:48.416
YEAR BEFORE THE NEW STANDARDS

35:48.485 --> 35:49.817
WERE RELEASED, TO 151 SO FAR

35:49.886 --> 35:52.153
THIS YEAR.

35:52.222 --> 35:53.621
ALSO, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, "THE

35:53.690 --> 35:54.689
PANCREAS EXCEPTION" SOUNDS LIKE

35:54.758 --> 35:56.090
A DIRECT-TO-DVD THRILLER FROM

35:56.159 --> 35:56.659
2003 STARRING NICHOLAS CAGE.

35:56.726 --> 36:00.194
AS FOR UNOS, THIS PAST

36:00.263 --> 36:01.028
SEPTEMBER, PRESIDENT BIDEN

36:01.097 --> 36:02.997
SIGNED A BILL THAT COULD SPLIT

36:03.066 --> 36:03.533
UP ITS CONTRACT AND ALLOW

36:03.600 --> 36:06.434
OTHERS, INCLUDING FOR-PROFIT

36:06.503 --> 36:07.068
COMPANIES, TO COMPETE FOR PARTS

36:07.137 --> 36:08.936
OF THE SERVICES IT NOW PROVIDES.

36:09.005 --> 36:10.605
WILL THAT IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY

36:10.674 --> 36:12.707
OF OUR NATIONAL SYSTEM?

36:12.776 --> 36:13.307
LET'S HOPE SO, BUT THE JURY'S

36:13.376 --> 36:14.375
CURRENTLY OUT.

36:14.444 --> 36:17.145
AS FOR WHOLE BODIES DONATED FOR

36:17.214 --> 36:18.212
RESEARCH, THERE'S A LAW AWAITING

36:18.281 --> 36:18.782
A VOTE IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW

36:18.849 --> 36:20.782
THAT WOULD ENSURE DONATED BODIES

36:20.851 --> 36:21.415
ARE NOT UNKNOWINGLY CONTRIBUTED

36:21.484 --> 36:23.618
TO A FOR-PROFIT INDUSTRY, WHICH

36:23.687 --> 36:28.422
SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

36:28.491 --> 36:29.023
BUT EVEN AS WE'RE WAITING FOR

36:29.092 --> 36:31.526
THESE LONG OVERDUE IMPROVEMENTS,

36:31.595 --> 36:33.094
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT

36:33.163 --> 36:33.795
SOMETHING HERE: I'M AN ORGAN

36:33.864 --> 36:36.230
DONOR.

36:36.299 --> 36:37.365
WHEN I DIE AND SOMEONE IS IN

36:37.434 --> 36:39.901
NEED OF THESE SUB-PAR ORGANS,

36:39.970 --> 36:41.235
THEY CAN HAVE AT 'EM!

36:41.304 --> 36:41.704
AND NOTHING THAT WE'VE

36:41.771 --> 36:42.837
RESEARCHED OR COVERED TONIGHT,

36:42.906 --> 36:43.905
HOWEVER UNPLEASANT IT'S BEEN,

36:43.974 --> 36:44.505
HAS CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT THAT

36:44.574 --> 36:47.508
DECISION.

36:47.577 --> 36:48.609
AND WHILE PERSONALLY, I WOULDN'T

36:48.678 --> 36:49.844
MIND BEING A SKELETON DOING A

36:49.913 --> 36:51.078
BACKFLIP IN A MUSEUM, I KNOW

36:51.147 --> 36:53.347
THAT MY FAMILY MIGHT HAVE SOME

36:53.416 --> 36:54.115
OBJECTIONS TO THAT.

36:54.184 --> 36:56.584
SO, IF YOU WANT TO, AND YOU

36:56.653 --> 36:58.453
HAVEN'T ALREADY, YOU SHOULD SIGN

36:58.522 --> 37:01.088
UP TO DONATE YOUR ORGANS -- YOU

37:01.157 --> 37:04.425
CAN DO THAT AT RegisterMe.org.

37:04.494 --> 37:05.760
IF WANT TO LOOK INTO BEING A

37:05.829 --> 37:06.828
LIVING KIDNEY DONOR, YOU CAN

37:06.897 --> 37:08.596
LEARN MORE AT OrganDonor.gov.

37:08.665 --> 37:10.498
AND WHETHER YOU WANT TO DONATE

37:10.567 --> 37:11.833
YOUR ORGANS, OR YOUR WHOLE BODY,

37:11.902 --> 37:12.900
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE A

37:12.969 --> 37:13.501
CONVERSATION WITH YOUR FAMILY

37:13.570 --> 37:15.503
NOW ABOUT IT.

37:15.572 --> 37:17.872
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY TO TALK

37:17.941 --> 37:18.506
TO THEM ABOUT THIS -- OR INDEED,

37:18.575 --> 37:21.209
ANYTHING.

37:21.278 --> 37:21.809
BUT IT -- IT IS REALLY

37:21.878 --> 37:23.911
IMPORTANT.

37:23.980 --> 37:24.812
BECAUSE REMEMBER, LIVES ARE

37:24.881 --> 37:26.380
HANGING IN THE BALANCE HERE.

37:26.449 --> 37:26.981
THESE DONATIONS ARE IMMENSELY

37:27.050 --> 37:29.417
GENEROUS GIFTS.

37:29.486 --> 37:29.986
AND WE ALL DESERVE A SYSTEM

37:30.053 --> 37:30.952
THAT'S WORTHY OF THAT

37:31.021 --> 37:32.420
GENEROSITY.

37:32.489 --> 37:33.087
ONE THAT OPERATES WITH

37:33.156 --> 37:34.322
EFFICIENCY, SAVES AS MANY LIVES

37:34.391 --> 37:35.923
AS POSSIBLE, AND THAT, AT THE

37:35.992 --> 37:38.359
VERY LEAST, ENSURES EVERY HEART

37:38.428 --> 37:41.129
MAKES ITS AIRLINE CONNECTION,

37:41.198 --> 37:42.263
AND NOBODY'S BODY UNEXPECTEDLY

37:42.332 --> 37:43.798
WINDS UP SLICED AND DICED IN A

37:43.867 --> 37:46.300
TWO-STAR BUSINESS HOTEL.

37:46.369 --> 37:49.103
IT'S JUST NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK.

37:49.172 --> 37:49.606
THAT IS OUR SHOW.

37:49.673 --> 37:51.172
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

37:51.241 --> 37:52.240
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
