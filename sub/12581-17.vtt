00:38.650 --> 00:40.082
How's it going, Joe Jack?

00:40.183 --> 00:42.547
I lost my bathroom
key again, honey.

00:42.849 --> 00:45.179
( car horn playing
"Yellow Rose of Texas" )

00:48.584 --> 00:49.550
Mr. Strickland?

00:49.584 --> 00:52.106
Yeah. Hank, I just lost
a pile of money

00:52.150 --> 00:54.707
and a pair of Eye-talian Loafers

00:54.749 --> 00:57.738
to that sleaze bag
Lane Pratley.

00:57.783 --> 00:59.942
Oh, and you can cancel

00:59.983 --> 01:01.347
the morning run
to Strickland North.

01:01.383 --> 01:02.871
I lost that, too.

01:02.916 --> 01:06.439
I got to take my mind
off my boo-hoos.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.779
Donna! Find me that website

01:08.816 --> 01:11.748
where the elephant does his
business on the man's head.

01:17.716 --> 01:20.682
Sir, I... I don't like
to ask personal questions,

01:20.716 --> 01:22.342
but... are you okay?

01:22.383 --> 01:24.645
My wife threw me out.

01:24.684 --> 01:25.650
What?

01:25.684 --> 01:26.650
Yeah.

01:26.684 --> 01:28.707
I had Donna over at the house.

01:28.749 --> 01:33.306
The old crow found us
in flagrante on the credenza.

01:33.350 --> 01:34.680
It's all over.

01:34.716 --> 01:37.876
She said she could handle
my drinking binges

01:37.916 --> 01:39.314
and my gambling

01:39.350 --> 01:43.715
and even turn a blind eye
to my extramarital escapades

01:43.749 --> 01:46.806
but not when they happen
all at once

01:46.849 --> 01:48.338
and on her birthday.

01:48.383 --> 01:52.475
Ah! I don't know
what to do anymore, Hank.

01:52.517 --> 01:55.142
( sobbing )

01:55.183 --> 01:57.376
Uh...

01:57.417 --> 02:01.940
There, there, sir.

02:01.983 --> 02:03.210
( sobbing )

02:04.283 --> 02:06.044
Today we start cross-country.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.878
Every day
for the next two weeks,

02:07.916 --> 02:09.542
you kids are going
to be running.

02:09.584 --> 02:11.015
For those of you
a little overweight

02:11.050 --> 02:12.948
or not athletic,
this will be difficult,

02:12.983 --> 02:14.279
but so will life. Now go.

02:14.317 --> 02:18.272
Uh, Coach.

02:18.317 --> 02:19.214
If you don't mind,

02:19.250 --> 02:21.772
I prefer to play
to my strengths.

02:21.816 --> 02:24.839
Why don't I just hang back
and hold the clipboard?

02:24.883 --> 02:27.076
Move it, Hill.

02:27.116 --> 02:29.412
( groans )

02:29.450 --> 02:31.006
( panting )

02:31.050 --> 02:34.244
Hey, Maggie,
if we stay together,

02:34.283 --> 02:36.749
neither one of us
will be last.

02:36.783 --> 02:38.442
I Let you hide behind
me in dodgeball.

02:38.483 --> 02:41.915
I'm through with you.

02:55.016 --> 02:57.073
My running days are over.

02:57.116 --> 03:00.674
I'm home.

03:00.716 --> 03:03.307
Table for one near
the air conditioner.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.373
Sorry, kid, this is high tea.

03:05.417 --> 03:07.542
We require a jacket and tie

03:07.584 --> 03:09.447
and long pants and no sneakers.

03:09.483 --> 03:13.006
Doesn't passion
count for anything?

03:13.050 --> 03:16.675
LUANNE:
My Bible study teacher
ls going on vacation

03:16.716 --> 03:20.444
and he won't Let me
be the substitute teacher

03:20.483 --> 03:21.779
while he's gone.

03:21.816 --> 03:22.873
I think he's just jealous

03:22.916 --> 03:25.178
of my close
relationship with Jesus.

03:25.217 --> 03:27.183
Oh, Luanne, give
him more credit.

03:27.217 --> 03:29.410
Maybe he genuinely thinks
you won't be good at it.

03:29.450 --> 03:31.779
Nobody has any faith in me.

03:31.816 --> 03:35.942
I'm telling Jesus
that you weren't any help.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.142
You are not
going to believe

03:37.183 --> 03:38.376
what's happened artwork.

03:38.417 --> 03:40.906
Buck gambled away
Strickland North.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.439
It's gone. Gone.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.676
And you are surprised
by this behavior?

03:44.716 --> 03:47.477
Hank, the man is
a lying, cheating,

03:47.517 --> 03:48.914
drunken, gambling,

03:48.950 --> 03:50.939
philandering adulterer.

03:50.983 --> 03:52.609
I know he has his demons,

03:52.650 --> 03:55.775
but he's also the guy
who took me under his wing

03:55.816 --> 03:58.305
and brought me
into the world of propane

03:58.350 --> 04:00.339
and propane accessories.

04:00.383 --> 04:03.815
There's a money-back
guarantee on those.

04:03.849 --> 04:07.576
It's not the store's
policy-- itâ€™s just mine.

04:07.617 --> 04:10.879
You do a damn fine job of
selling dungarees there,

04:10.916 --> 04:12.779
uh... Hank,

04:12.816 --> 04:15.112
but Let me tell you
what I'm selling.

04:15.150 --> 04:16.774
Propane.

04:16.815 --> 04:18.476
Huh.

04:18.517 --> 04:19.483
Propane.

04:19.517 --> 04:22.312
He was a window
into the exciting world

04:22.350 --> 04:23.680
of clean-burning heat.

04:23.716 --> 04:26.205
Yeah. You keep these
tanks shiny and clean

04:26.250 --> 04:27.511
they reflect
more sunlight

04:27.550 --> 04:28.481
and stay cooler.

04:28.517 --> 04:30.415
That means less
gas escapes

04:30.450 --> 04:32.643
through this
here valve, see?

04:32.683 --> 04:34.205
( sighs )

04:34.250 --> 04:36.113
I can't turn my back on him.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.639
Without buck, I'd
be selling pants.

04:38.683 --> 04:39.740
I'd never tell him this,

04:39.783 --> 04:43.511
but... I think
of him as a... a mentor.

04:43.550 --> 04:47.642
Really? I thought I
was your mentor.

04:47.683 --> 04:48.671
I'm worried, fellows.

04:48.716 --> 04:50.875
Buck's never
been this bad

04:50.916 --> 04:52.007
and this time, I'm afraid

04:52.050 --> 04:54.312
he's going to take
the business down with him.

04:54.350 --> 04:56.316
You know what a
friend would do?

04:56.350 --> 04:57.940
He'd get me to burn down

04:57.983 --> 05:00.040
said other friendâ€™s
failing business

05:00.083 --> 05:01.878
for the insurance money.

05:01.916 --> 05:03.143
Just say
the word

05:03.183 --> 05:04.149
or don't.

05:04.183 --> 05:05.149
I'll get the signal.

05:05.183 --> 05:06.149
Just nod your head.

05:06.183 --> 05:08.149
Or don't.

05:12.350 --> 05:13.577
Shut up, Dale.

05:13.617 --> 05:18.947
So, we're on.

05:18.983 --> 05:21.609
( sighs )

05:21.650 --> 05:22.945
Hmm.

05:22.983 --> 05:25.245
Buck's back on the floor.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.078
You got to buy
this grill.

05:28.116 --> 05:29.945
I need the money.

05:29.983 --> 05:33.710
There's a horse
that can make all this right.

05:33.749 --> 05:34.715
You got cash?

05:34.749 --> 05:36.079
Huh? Huh?

05:36.116 --> 05:37.412
( vomiting )

05:37.450 --> 05:42.677
Uh... sir, why don't
I take you home?

05:42.716 --> 05:44.012
Good idea.

05:44.050 --> 05:47.312
No, wait a second.

05:47.350 --> 05:49.282
( vomiting )

05:49.317 --> 05:50.578
( coughing )

05:50.617 --> 05:51.912
Okay.

05:51.950 --> 05:53.246
( sobbing )

05:53.283 --> 05:56.511
I'm so got dang lonely.

05:56.550 --> 05:59.448
Hey, you know,
before I drop you off,

05:59.483 --> 06:01.540
there's someone I'd like
to introduce you to.

06:01.584 --> 06:03.708
I think you two
might hit it off.

06:03.749 --> 06:08.444
Can we go yet?

06:08.483 --> 06:10.813
No, not until
you hear me out.

06:10.849 --> 06:14.145
Sir, the flame in
you has grown dim,

06:14.183 --> 06:16.411
but if you'll just
take your hands off the valve,

06:16.450 --> 06:21.178
and Let Him in, the Lord
will fill you with His gas.

06:21.217 --> 06:22.183
So I'll just

06:22.217 --> 06:24.206
leave you two
by yourselves here.

06:24.250 --> 06:28.012
You probably have a lot
of catching up to do.

06:31.383 --> 06:32.849
PEGGY:
You cannot fix

06:32.883 --> 06:34.042
Buck Strickland.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.379
He is drowning in a sea
of his own addictions

06:36.417 --> 06:37.610
and if there
is one thing

06:37.650 --> 06:39.878
that I learned
at YWCA camp,

06:39.916 --> 06:43.973
you cannot save
a drowning man.

06:51.150 --> 06:53.048
( car horn playing
""Yellow Rose of Texas"" )

06:53.083 --> 06:55.140
I used to like
that song.

06:55.183 --> 06:56.171
Now it scares me.

06:56.217 --> 06:58.149
Greetings,
fellow Christians.

06:58.183 --> 07:00.308
Ah, there's the shepherd

07:00.350 --> 07:05.112
that brought this lost
sheep back into the fold.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.173
I did?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.807
Huh. So it worked.

07:07.849 --> 07:09.508
Bless you, Hank.

07:09.550 --> 07:12.072
Well, in fairness,
I didn't really do anything.

07:12.116 --> 07:14.412
I just alley-ooped you
to the Lord.

07:14.450 --> 07:15.813
Well, you brought me to church

07:15.849 --> 07:18.940
where I met an angel
who showed me the light.

07:18.983 --> 07:21.108
This woman is
gonna keep me

07:21.150 --> 07:23.241
on the straight
and narrow path

07:23.283 --> 07:24.579
to the promised land.

07:24.617 --> 07:26.242
Praise be!

07:26.283 --> 07:28.476
Nothing but net, Lord.

07:28.517 --> 07:31.950
I understand why God
loves Buck-- He has to--

07:31.983 --> 07:34.915
but what kind of pathetic
doormat of a woman

07:34.950 --> 07:35.916
would fall for him?

07:35.950 --> 07:36.938
Come on, Peggy.

07:36.983 --> 07:39.040
I bet sheâ€™s just
some nice old lady

07:39.083 --> 07:41.140
who used to be
a nurse or something.

07:41.183 --> 07:43.149
You know how those
churchy types are.

07:43.183 --> 07:44.581
They like a fixer-upper.

07:44.617 --> 07:46.310
Hey, Uncle Hank,
Aunt Peggy!

07:46.350 --> 07:49.510
Look who I saved!

07:49.550 --> 07:50.538
Hallelujah.

07:50.584 --> 07:52.550
Good Lord.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.115
What the hell is going on here?

07:57.150 --> 07:59.343
A private Bible
study crass.

07:59.383 --> 08:00.678
Praise the Lord!

08:00.716 --> 08:02.682
Luanne,
Platter family conference

08:02.716 --> 08:04.409
on the patio, ahora.

08:04.450 --> 08:09.644
Is he hitting on you?

08:09.683 --> 08:10.842
Is he coming on to you?

08:10.883 --> 08:12.247
Has he put
his hands on you?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.476
What has he done to you?

08:13.517 --> 08:15.039
Nothing, Aunt Peggy.

08:15.083 --> 08:18.049
I found him at the church
and he was so sad and lost.

08:18.083 --> 08:21.174
I told him about the word of God

08:21.217 --> 08:24.047
and he volunteered
me to be his private
Bible tutor.

08:24.083 --> 08:27.311
Me! A Bible tutor.

08:27.350 --> 08:29.111
Luanne,
you're on the naive side.

08:29.150 --> 08:32.275
But even you cannot be
buying this horse manure.

08:32.317 --> 08:34.145
Buck is my student.

08:34.183 --> 08:35.808
I am his teacher.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.077
And the Lord is our principal.

08:39.116 --> 08:45.708
And until He rings the bell,
crass will not be dismissed.

08:45.749 --> 08:49.045
Uh... are you trying
to date my niece, sir?

08:49.083 --> 08:53.516
Now, OI' Top, I don't blame you
for thinking the worst of me,

08:53.550 --> 08:55.845
but I'm a changed man.

08:55.883 --> 09:00.373
LUANNE:
Now, if you'll
excuse us,

09:00.417 --> 09:06.372
we have to get
back to crass.

09:08.883 --> 09:11.940
You know, Luanne,
it's awful hot out here.

09:11.983 --> 09:14.608
Maybe next week we could
study in the pool.

09:14.649 --> 09:16.616
Bible crass in the pool?

09:16.649 --> 09:19.013
Like a baptism.

09:19.050 --> 09:22.346
( chuckles ):
Yeah, I'll bring my swimsuit.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.378
Are these English cucumbers
in the cucumber sandwiches?

09:38.417 --> 09:41.781
The regular ones
come back on me.

09:41.816 --> 09:42.782
I don't know.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.782
Well, would you find out
for me, please?

09:44.816 --> 09:49.942
It's so nice to see
such a refined young man.

09:49.983 --> 09:52.472
My grandson steals from me.

09:52.517 --> 09:54.006
Would you care to join us?

09:54.050 --> 09:58.005
That depends: would you care
to share your lemon curd?

09:58.050 --> 09:59.141
Oh, hmm.

09:59.183 --> 10:04.945
( chuckles )

10:04.983 --> 10:08.381
Hank, you've been very unclear
on this whole thing.

10:08.417 --> 10:12.247
Do you or do you not want me
to burn down your workplace?

10:12.283 --> 10:13.340
Dang it, Dale,

10:13.383 --> 10:16.247
I donâ€™t want you going
anywhere near Strickland.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.805
Things have been great
since Buck found religion.

10:18.849 --> 10:21.179
Again, your words say 'no,''

10:21.217 --> 10:24.910
but your body language says
'torch that sucker.''

10:24.950 --> 10:26.848
Un-be-freakin-lievabIe.

10:26.883 --> 10:30.316
Peggy, will you knock it off?

10:30.350 --> 10:33.145
Why canâ€™t you just accept
the man's been saved?

10:33.183 --> 10:34.581
It doesn't
cost you anything.

10:34.617 --> 10:36.344
They are in the pool, Hank.

10:36.383 --> 10:38.712
Luanne is in her bikini.

10:38.749 --> 10:41.715
Her hair is wet. Sopping wet.

10:41.749 --> 10:44.271
Well, she's supposed to be
giving him a Bible lesson.

10:44.317 --> 10:46.680
I'm going to make sure
it stays a Bible lesson.

10:46.716 --> 10:49.148
So, that's why it's better

10:49.183 --> 10:53.115
to be a little bird
sitting in heaven

10:53.150 --> 10:58.082
than to be the biggest,
toughest grizzly bear in hell.

10:58.116 --> 11:01.048
Do you know what I mean?

11:01.083 --> 11:02.049
Yes?

11:02.083 --> 11:03.049
Yay!

11:03.083 --> 11:04.049
Fellowship hug!

11:04.083 --> 11:05.049
Whoo!

11:05.083 --> 11:06.049
Amen to that.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.049
Dude, what are you
doing with her?

11:08.083 --> 11:10.049
This is a Bible
study crass, Joseph.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.413
Oh, yeah?

11:11.450 --> 11:16.348
Um... I like the Bible.
A bunch.

11:16.383 --> 11:19.543
Well, come on in.

11:19.584 --> 11:22.106
I thought this was a
private Bible tutorial.

11:22.150 --> 11:28.049
There's enough God
to go around.

11:36.617 --> 11:37.843
Need another student?

11:37.883 --> 11:41.645
Uncle Hank,
youâ€™re joining the crass?

11:41.683 --> 11:42.706
What are you doing here?

11:42.749 --> 11:44.339
Bible-ing up, dude.

11:44.383 --> 11:48.281
Joseph, go home.

11:48.317 --> 11:49.613
Nuh-uh, hold on.

11:49.649 --> 11:52.207
This is my
Bible study crass.

11:52.250 --> 11:55.273
And all of God's creatures
are welcome.

11:55.317 --> 11:56.283
Even Joseph.

11:56.317 --> 11:58.806
Oh, Bobby, you are a delight.

11:58.849 --> 12:02.111
Pearl, we should fix him up
with your niece.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.138
How old is she?

12:03.183 --> 12:04.149
37.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.705
Okay, the thing
about camels

12:06.749 --> 12:10.340
going through the
eye of a needle--

12:10.383 --> 12:13.406
it's not good
for the camels,

12:13.450 --> 12:17.246
so you can understand
why it's not good to be rich.

12:17.283 --> 12:18.249
Totally.

12:18.283 --> 12:19.544
I'm as good as broke.

12:19.584 --> 12:22.141
I'm losing everything
in the divorce.

12:22.183 --> 12:26.479
Hey, is this the Bible
study in the pool crass?

12:26.517 --> 12:27.710
HANK:
Principal Moss?

12:27.749 --> 12:28.715
BUCK:
Pratley!

12:28.749 --> 12:29.840
Aw, rooster poop!

12:29.883 --> 12:31.712
You got my flyer.

12:31.749 --> 12:32.840
We sure did, Teach.

12:32.883 --> 12:35.543
And that picture
does not do you justice.

12:35.584 --> 12:38.311
Oh, dang,
I forgot my Bible.

12:38.350 --> 12:40.316
I'll just kind of look off
yours here, Miss Luanne.

12:40.350 --> 12:43.747
Okay, but next time,
you'd better remember.

12:43.783 --> 12:45.942
Remember-iness
is next to holiness.

12:45.983 --> 12:50.348
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on here.

12:50.383 --> 12:52.349
We donâ€™t want to distract
the teacher.

12:52.383 --> 12:54.349
Principal Moss,
you can look on with me.

12:54.383 --> 12:56.178
Okay, then.

12:56.217 --> 13:02.081
Now, Luanne, weren't
you and Buck discussing

13:02.116 --> 13:04.514
the importance
of the commandments

13:04.550 --> 13:08.380
and why you shouldnâ€™t
covet things and such?

13:08.417 --> 13:10.542
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, Luanne...

13:10.584 --> 13:12.413
Hey, can I get in on this?

13:12.450 --> 13:13.710
Well, who the heck
are you?

13:13.749 --> 13:15.306
Octavio, dude.

13:15.350 --> 13:16.373
( yells )

13:16.417 --> 13:20.611
We're trying to talk about
the Bible here!

13:20.649 --> 13:24.308
Oh, sure, Ese.
I'm way into it.

13:24.350 --> 13:27.475
Hey, look what
I got-- Jesus.

13:27.517 --> 13:29.142
Oh, that's beautiful.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.842
Hey, that's Rob Zombie.

13:30.883 --> 13:32.076
Shut up, kid.

13:32.116 --> 13:33.706
He got my Bible wet.

13:33.749 --> 13:37.147
Okay, Joseph, Octavio,
no more fellowship hugs.

13:37.183 --> 13:41.582
Not until you show me
you're here to learn the Bible,

13:41.616 --> 13:42.582
not get it wet.

13:42.616 --> 13:46.241
Pearl, I talked to my doctor
about you yesterday,

13:46.283 --> 13:48.146
and he agrees with me--

13:48.183 --> 13:51.115
you've got to cut down
on the salt.

14:01.350 --> 14:02.475
He's coming in.

14:02.517 --> 14:05.039
Just act natural
and pass me the scones.

14:05.083 --> 14:08.640
I thought
I saw someone I know.

14:08.683 --> 14:10.615
Mind if I take a look around?

14:10.649 --> 14:12.615
Sorry, sir,
we have a dress code--

14:12.649 --> 14:15.638
ties for men,
no tube tops for the ladies.

14:15.683 --> 14:20.173
Ah... Uh-huh.

14:20.217 --> 14:22.649
So, Paul was named Saul

14:22.683 --> 14:25.445
until he saw Jesus
on the road to Damascus

14:25.483 --> 14:26.449
and changed his ways.

14:26.483 --> 14:27.449
That's right!
Fellowship hug!

14:27.483 --> 14:28.380
Oh, boy.

14:28.417 --> 14:30.644
So, when the Bible says

14:30.683 --> 14:34.047
"He is without sin should
cast the first stone''

14:34.083 --> 14:35.049
what it's saying is...

14:35.083 --> 14:37.379
It's saying...
What it's saying is,

14:37.417 --> 14:41.315
is we should look
at our own sins.

14:41.350 --> 14:43.316
Try to be better people.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.815
Yes. But if you...

14:44.849 --> 14:46.815
Sure, but you can't be
a better person

14:46.849 --> 14:48.815
just by acting
all righteous and stuff.

14:48.849 --> 14:50.815
It says right here in
the Book of Acts that--

14:50.849 --> 14:54.372
wait, uh, the red letters
are the Jesus words, right?

14:54.417 --> 15:00.179
Uh, Luanne,
if Buck could just...

15:00.217 --> 15:01.205
I've got a testimony!

15:01.250 --> 15:05.615
Now you all may have read
the story of the prodigal son,

15:05.649 --> 15:08.706
but fellow Christians,
I have lived it.

15:08.749 --> 15:12.307
I have strayed far and long
from the path of the righteous.

15:12.350 --> 15:14.782
I have sinned,
I have lied,

15:14.816 --> 15:17.782
I have fornicated on
stolen antique furniture.

15:17.816 --> 15:19.373
But I will
tell you this...

15:19.417 --> 15:23.144
the good Lord sets
the most beautiful table

15:23.183 --> 15:29.082
for the son who's eaten
from the most dumpsters.

15:33.450 --> 15:35.006
Huh.

15:35.050 --> 15:36.709
Wow.

15:36.749 --> 15:39.909
You know, I have to admit,
Buck is a changed man.

15:39.950 --> 15:42.280
Luanne must be one heck
of a Bible teacher.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.805
Yep, I guess she really
got through to him.

15:44.849 --> 15:46.815
And all that time
in the water's

15:46.849 --> 15:48.542
been good for his phlebitis.

15:48.584 --> 15:53.915
( doorbell rings )

15:53.950 --> 15:55.007
Sorry to interrupt,

15:55.050 --> 15:57.607
but I had something very
important to tell you two.

15:57.649 --> 15:59.275
I'm an old-fashioned man,

15:59.317 --> 16:01.976
and as Luanne's nearest
unincarcerated kin,

16:02.016 --> 16:04.380
I wanted you to be
the first to know--

16:04.417 --> 16:10.577
I'm going to ask
Luanne to marry me.

16:19.417 --> 16:22.508
Wow, Buck and Luanne.

16:22.550 --> 16:23.640
Wow.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.115
Well... I guess
it was inevitable.

16:26.150 --> 16:28.139
Women from broken homes

16:28.183 --> 16:31.377
always look for
a father figure.

16:31.417 --> 16:34.247
I guess technically, Buck is
more of a grandfather figure,

16:34.283 --> 16:36.272
but I guess that might
even be healthier.

16:36.317 --> 16:39.681
Well, there, I've made it
palatable for myself.

16:39.716 --> 16:42.580
And Luanne's been a pretty good
influence on Buck.

16:42.616 --> 16:43.583
Did you see him?

16:43.616 --> 16:44.809
He was clean-cut, polite--

16:44.849 --> 16:46.815
he wasn't even sweating vodka.

16:46.849 --> 16:49.872
And when Buck's in good shape,
so is Strickland Propane.

16:49.916 --> 16:53.314
Hank, do you realize
if they marry,

16:53.350 --> 16:54.940
Buck will be our nephew.

16:54.983 --> 16:56.279
Huh.

16:56.317 --> 16:58.283
You know, Buck will
probably lose his house

16:58.317 --> 17:00.839
in the divorce, and move in
with Luanne.

17:00.883 --> 17:03.678
He and I could drive
to work together.

17:03.716 --> 17:07.647
Luanne, you've changed
this ornery old jackass

17:07.683 --> 17:09.842
into a noble pack mule.

17:09.883 --> 17:11.848
But this mule
donâ€™t want to walk

17:11.883 --> 17:13.848
life's treacherous
mountain path alone.

17:13.883 --> 17:18.747
Luanne Platter, will you
have me as your husband?

17:18.782 --> 17:20.646
( gasps )
Oh, my God!

17:20.683 --> 17:21.842
Oh, my God!

17:21.883 --> 17:23.041
Of course not.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.049
Jibbit?

17:24.083 --> 17:25.049
Mr. Strickland,

17:25.083 --> 17:26.208
that's so crazy.

17:26.250 --> 17:27.477
You're very nice,

17:27.517 --> 17:29.949
but youâ€™re totally old.

17:29.983 --> 17:32.347
I like young guys

17:32.383 --> 17:35.940
who love Jesus,
but have fitness...

17:35.983 --> 17:37.142
and hair.

17:37.183 --> 17:39.547
No, no, you see...

17:39.584 --> 17:41.947
I... I got...

17:41.983 --> 17:48.041
( stammering )

17:48.083 --> 17:49.878
She... spurned me!

17:49.916 --> 17:52.814
I've been spurned!

17:52.849 --> 17:54.338
She what?

17:54.383 --> 17:56.372
( sobbing ):
She toyed with my affections.

17:56.417 --> 17:59.440
She was only doing it
to get me to the Lord.

17:59.483 --> 18:01.108
How sick is that?

18:01.150 --> 18:05.605
Sir, wait.

18:05.649 --> 18:06.615
Luanne, what happened?

18:06.649 --> 18:08.774
Buck just wanted to marry me
and I said no.

18:08.816 --> 18:09.782
( sighs )

18:09.816 --> 18:10.804
Well, he looked
pretty upset.

18:10.849 --> 18:12.145
And when Buck's upset,

18:12.183 --> 18:14.342
he dives straight
into his addictions.

18:14.383 --> 18:15.110
Oh, that's okay.

18:15.150 --> 18:19.673
He's totally addicted
to Jesus now.

18:22.983 --> 18:24.210
Earl Grey.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.375
Come on, give me a tough one.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.440
( gasps )

18:28.483 --> 18:29.812
Bobby Hill.

18:29.849 --> 18:31.815
You just ate your last...

18:31.849 --> 18:33.179
...thingie.

18:33.217 --> 18:34.183
Muffin?

18:34.217 --> 18:34.978
Pastry?

18:35.016 --> 18:37.574
What... whatever.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.139
Move it!

18:40.183 --> 18:44.138
Congratulations, Mr. FybeI.

18:44.183 --> 18:45.308
I'll be out there tomorrow

18:45.350 --> 18:47.509
to personally hook up
your new tanks.

18:47.550 --> 18:53.380
( car horn playing
""Yellow Rose of Texas"" )

18:53.417 --> 18:55.042
BUCK:
Yee-ha!

18:55.083 --> 19:00.106
( drunkenly ):
Well, what are you
all looking at,

19:00.150 --> 19:01.343
you heathens?

19:01.383 --> 19:02.440
No, sir.

19:02.483 --> 19:03.778
Not on the premises,

19:03.816 --> 19:05.782
and certainty not during
business hours.

19:05.816 --> 19:06.782
Fine, then.

19:06.816 --> 19:10.180
Hank, let's you and me go bet
on the ponies.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.648
I'll just get
some cash from
the safe.

19:12.683 --> 19:13.876
Don't bother, sir.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.711
I changed the combination.

19:15.749 --> 19:18.181
But it's always been
my birthday.

19:18.217 --> 19:20.115
Well, now it's my birthday.

19:20.150 --> 19:21.740
You've been here 20 years.

19:21.783 --> 19:24.181
I... I know your birthday.
I know it.

19:24.217 --> 19:27.149
It's... Sept... Sepover...

19:27.183 --> 19:31.616
Septober... 22, 29...

19:31.649 --> 19:32.706
( sighs )

19:32.749 --> 19:40.148
( snoring )

19:40.183 --> 19:45.445
( sighs )

20:08.150 --> 20:10.581
Hank, I'm sorry.

20:10.616 --> 20:12.844
Yeah, I know.

20:12.883 --> 20:15.849
Don't we have a boy
who comes and does this?

20:15.883 --> 20:18.247
Yeah, but the better
these tanks are polished,

20:18.283 --> 20:20.908
the more sunlight they reflect,
the cooler they stay

20:20.950 --> 20:23.416
and the less propane escapes
through that valve.

20:23.450 --> 20:25.711
That valve... yeah.

20:25.749 --> 20:29.375
I taught you that.

20:29.417 --> 20:33.110
You know, Buck, maybe Luanne
and her Bible crass in the pool

20:33.150 --> 20:35.945
was His way of getting
your attention.

20:35.983 --> 20:38.415
So you could see what's
really important.

20:38.450 --> 20:41.938
Yeah, propane's been good to me.

20:41.983 --> 20:44.881
Well, Lady Propane's
been good to all of us, sir.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.905
( chuckles )

20:46.950 --> 20:50.712
Lady Propane.

21:00.916 --> 21:02.848
That's a perfect swirl, sir.

21:02.883 --> 21:05.179
You know, maybe
I could get rid

21:05.217 --> 21:06.513
of all my old
addictions

21:06.550 --> 21:10.107
and get myself hooked
solely on propane.

21:10.150 --> 21:11.480
And maybe just one other thing.

21:11.517 --> 21:12.846
You know, keep things spicy.

21:12.883 --> 21:16.247
Boy, these
5,000 gallon heifers

21:16.283 --> 21:20.409
look pretty at
sunset, don't they?

21:20.450 --> 21:22.177
They sure do, sir.

21:22.217 --> 21:27.309
Oh, and those are
1,000 gallon tanks.

21:27.350 --> 21:28.338
And it's sunrise.
