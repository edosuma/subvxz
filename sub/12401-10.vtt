clean up.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.165
             Mom.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.568
          Holly said
          we could have seconds.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.503

      There's no one downstairs.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.248

   It was just like Mommy.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.052
Shh, baby.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.021
I got you, baby girl.

07:08.294 --> 07:09.928
               Come on, sweetie.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.944
Oh, baby.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.113
Hey, I... I got you.
It's okay.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.148
   You're safe, okay?

07:31.317 --> 07:33.118
You're safe, baby.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.823
Look, I need you
to get in the car

07:37.825 --> 07:39.691

of Holly, all right?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.394
        Okay?

07:42.396 --> 07:44.463
                (whimpering)
    It's okay.

      I'm so sorry, Kyle.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.942
        I should have never
        come out of my house.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.310
It's not your fault.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.345

09:34.441 --> 09:36.107

09:36.109 --> 09:37.576
What kind of accident?

                 It's, um--
    We need your help.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.080
Honey, what is it?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.949
   Evening, Rose.
   Sorry to trouble you so late.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.250
   I got it, Rosie.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.451
                    Got what?

09:46.453 --> 09:48.853
Apparently, we got a situation.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.423
    Well, then I guess
    you better deal with it,

09:51.425 --> 09:53.758

 standing out in the cold.

There we go.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.697
   Let's get them inside.
Come on in, darling.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.898
       It's okay.
Come on in. That's it.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.199
       It's okay.
There you go.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.667

          Buzz, stop.

10:07.239 --> 10:09.608
               We didn't know
               where else to go.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.378
   I've known that family for...

10:16.482 --> 10:19.050
            How could his wife--
KYLE: Chief.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.820
It wasn't her.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.690
       Who's gonna believe that?

10:27.393 --> 10:29.060
                  A man is dead.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.962
                  One of mine.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.832
   You show up at my house
   with his blood on your hands?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.567
                  What the fuck
                  do you expect
                  me to do?

10:35.569 --> 10:36.868
We gotta find her.

10:38.604 --> 10:41.072
She can't ever know
what happened.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.741
        And how are you
        gonna do that?

10:42.743 --> 10:44.275
             She won't remember.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.744
We say it was an accident.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.348
         You asking me
         to cover up a homicide?

10:51.684 --> 10:53.485
She didn't kill anyone.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.321
             Law ain't gonna
             see it that way.

10:56.323 --> 11:00.091
The law will see it
however you want to see it.

11:30.222 --> 11:33.958
This is the second time
you've broken into my house.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.928
        Second time
        you know about.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.998
     And this house belongs
     to some old dude

11:40.000 --> 11:42.667
       who offed himself
       a month ago.

11:42.669 --> 11:43.535
           I checked.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.307
       Sliced himself up
       pretty good.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.211
      If you're finished,

11:53.213 --> 11:55.380
      you should go home.

12:01.153 --> 12:04.556
     You know, Anderson
     doesn't seem to be
     gettin' your message.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.294
       And what message is that?

12:10.229 --> 12:13.198
 Well, that the clock's ticking.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.366
  He better pack up his shit
  and get the fuck out of town

12:15.368 --> 12:17.502
   before whatever
   you're here for gets real.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.071
  What do you think
  I'm here for?

12:23.409 --> 12:24.909
               Must be big.

12:24.911 --> 12:28.613
   Considering what I'm guessing
   you did to get this house.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.584
                And what you did
                to Anderson.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.521
       And if it fucks this town
       right in the ass,

12:36.523 --> 12:38.490
             then you can
             count me in.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.430
         KAT:
         Shh, shh, shh.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.798
           It's okay.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.739
       Shh. It's all right.
       I'm here.
                    (whimpering)

12:54.741 --> 12:56.708
       Oh, oh, it's okay.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.042
           It's okay.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.811
  Yeah, get that out of there.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.379
           It's okay.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.714
             Yeah.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.150
              Shh.

13:10.422 --> 13:11.790
      KAT:
      Shh, shh, shh, shh.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.725
           I got you.
           I got you.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.395
        Shh. It's okay.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.831
   I know, it hurts. It hurts.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.533
             Oh, Jesus.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.904
    Would you dump that out
    for me, sweetheart?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.939
    Get me some fresh?
                  Why would it--

13:27.941 --> 13:30.208
            Why would it do that
            to itself?

13:31.177 --> 13:33.478
      She didn't like the light.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.413
     You know they're like that.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.348
            But Christ, her eye.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.018
This is why
what we're doing here
is so important.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.387
We need to get
to them sooner.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.758
        Babe, the water?

13:46.760 --> 13:48.593
  Shh. I'm here.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.361
            Yeah. Yeah.
       It's okay.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.530
      Here you go.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.098
      Oh, it's okay.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.167
      It's okay.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.003
Take good care of you.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.839
     Yeah, that feels good, huh?

14:00.841 --> 14:02.473
                       Oh, yeah.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.342
               Honey, it's okay.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.577
                      It's okay.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.748
                      It's okay.

14:30.402 --> 14:32.036
     Is somebody out there?

14:37.409 --> 14:39.577
Better not be
fucking with my car.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.381
I-- I'm serious.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.650
We have security cameras
out here.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.294
            Shit.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.672
   Hey, uh--

15:07.674 --> 15:10.642
You have to get out of here,
or I'll have to call the police.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.954
What-- Seriously.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.124
What-- what are you doing?

15:29.094 --> 15:30.361
              (sniffing)

15:51.083 --> 15:52.784
           (screams)

16:14.440 --> 16:16.107
       WOMAN (on radio):
       <i> Any unit, Code 1.</i>

16:16.109 --> 16:18.743
    (radio static crackles)

16:18.745 --> 16:20.211
    <i> No injuries reported.</i>

16:21.246 --> 16:22.680
     (police radio chatter)

16:22.682 --> 16:24.482
    You catch that?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.485
         Something about
         a hit and run I think.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.487
I don't know how
Giles can understand that thing.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.393
        You know this is
        a long shot.

16:38.864 --> 16:41.265
             I mean, maybe
             we should just call
             the state police.

16:41.267 --> 16:45.036
No. They'll only lock her up.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.871
I won't be able
to get close enough

16:46.873 --> 16:48.673
to pull that thing
out of her.

16:51.276 --> 16:54.379
        Are you not afraid
        of how she might end up?

16:54.381 --> 16:55.680
                 After.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.350
     I been thinkin' about that.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.720
      Why it is we can help some
      but not others.
Who knows?

17:02.722 --> 17:04.888
The strength of the demon,

17:04.891 --> 17:06.958
their will to resist it.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.459
It's got something to do

17:08.461 --> 17:09.961
with how long
it's been inside of them.

17:09.963 --> 17:12.130
Think about
Joshua and Allison.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.298
It had only been days.

17:15.501 --> 17:18.169
And then there's Blake,

17:18.171 --> 17:20.304
where it had been years.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.009
At that point,
they're too far gone.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.878
         Well, what about
         your mother and Sherry?
There's gotta be some time

17:27.881 --> 17:31.482
in between where I can still
get it out of them,

17:31.484 --> 17:35.820
   but it tears something
   of the person out with it.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.855
Just keep looking.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.490
There's still time.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.194
    WOMAN (on radio):
    <i> Any unit in the vicinity</i>

17:43.196 --> 17:46.230
  <i> of 5219 Springdale Avenue.</i>

17:46.232 --> 17:48.266
     <i> 5150. White female.</i>

17:48.268 --> 17:49.600
 <i> Approximately 30 years old.</i>

17:49.602 --> 17:51.235
<i>Possibly under the influence.</i>

17:51.237 --> 17:53.304
       <i> 1067. Code 3.</i>
   Let's go.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.118
         GILES:
         Hey, it's me.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.887
I'm over at Mark Holter's house.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.789
   There's been an accident.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.360
    It's too late for that.

18:16.362 --> 18:20.731
  I need you to come over here
  and help me clean up.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.966
            Mm-hmm.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.838
     (policemen grunt)
        (shrieking)

18:30.209 --> 18:31.709
          Hold still!

18:31.711 --> 18:34.212
Hey! Don't hurt her!

18:34.214 --> 18:35.780
              Stop.
Wait!

18:35.782 --> 18:38.316
Just wait.
           Stay back!

18:38.318 --> 18:40.284
Listen.
Don't take another fucking step.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.620
Okay, just listen--
     Just-- Kyle, back off.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.422
          This is his sister.
          He just wants to help.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.390
       You want to help?

18:46.392 --> 18:49.393
Get this on fuckin' video!

18:49.395 --> 18:51.662
     Why don't you
     tell us what she's on
     and where she got it?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.664
(woman shrieks)

18:53.666 --> 18:55.366
                      Shit.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.569
It's our mistake.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.140
      Shit.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.745
      Well, where to now?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.413
               How would I know?

19:09.415 --> 19:12.350
You've been doing this
a lot longer than I have.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.919
         I thought we determined
         I've been doing shit.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.488
Look, you've been around
these things for years.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.157
You've seen them,
up close.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.592
You know how they act.
You know what they want.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.027
          They're all different.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.695
Yeah, but they're
from the same place.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.297
They want the same things.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.799
They-- they don't like light.
They don't like to be touched.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.768
They can't communicate,
at least at first.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.005
There's gotta be
something that drives them.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.709
     Rev, I need your help.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.348
           They're all afraid.

19:45.784 --> 19:49.187
   (TV playing indistinctly)

19:51.323 --> 19:53.424
      (footsteps approach)

19:59.164 --> 20:01.299
(clattering, shattering outside)

20:02.968 --> 20:05.770
        (TV continuing)

20:20.252 --> 20:23.955
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

21:11.570 --> 21:17.041
      (breathing shakily)

21:21.913 --> 21:23.514
       Hello.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.621
Everything's gonna be okay.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.908
    Welcome.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.977
What is it then?
What are they most afraid of?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.279
    What demons fear the most.
    The truth, the Word of God--

21:55.281 --> 21:56.614
None of that, Rev.
Come on.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.082
Specifically,
what are they running from?

21:58.084 --> 21:59.183
           Kyle, you've seen it!

21:59.185 --> 22:01.352
     Holy water, the Scriptures,
     the cross.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.853
No, the cross
just freaks 'em out

22:02.855 --> 22:04.355
once you start
jabbing at 'em with it.

22:09.594 --> 22:11.595
            Look.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.264
      If we can figure out
      what that thing

22:13.266 --> 22:14.765
      inside of my sister
      is running from,

22:14.767 --> 22:16.901
    maybe we can figure out
    where it's running to.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.672
           You know, as violent
           as they can become...

22:23.275 --> 22:26.544
          underneath,
          they're like children.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.647
You give them something familiar
to... to calm them down

22:29.649 --> 22:33.117
         like an old photograph,
         music, toys.

22:34.619 --> 22:36.354
                  Wait a minute.
                  Faces, voices.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.189
             People, not things.
             You know, when--

22:38.191 --> 22:41.225
when they're really fighting it,
they're crying out for, uh...

22:41.227 --> 22:42.360
                   for a parent.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.928
          You know, somebody
          who took care of them.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.931
    Like they wanna be rescued.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.067
    Get in the car.

23:08.420 --> 23:11.489
         (line ringing)

23:11.491 --> 23:13.491
             WOMAN: <i> Hello?</i>
Hi, it's me.

23:13.493 --> 23:16.660
      Rosie, it's so good
      to hear your voice.

23:16.662 --> 23:18.028
     <i> Where are you?</i>

23:18.030 --> 23:19.430
               On the road.

23:19.432 --> 23:22.032
     I'm sorry that we had to go
     without saying goodbye.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.734
   It was a family emergency.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.336
Yeah, don't lie to me, Kat.

23:25.338 --> 23:28.005
We all know what's going on
in this town.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.707
Byron won't talk about it.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.609
  <i> Nobody will</i>
  <i> except Reverend Anderson,</i>

23:31.611 --> 23:33.043
  <i> and no one's</i>
  <i> listening to him.</i>

23:33.045 --> 23:35.279
 <i> Kat, if you know something,</i>
 <i> please tell me.</i>

23:35.281 --> 23:37.047
         Rosie, what's going on?

23:37.049 --> 23:38.749
           Did something happen?
    <i> I don't know.</i>

23:38.751 --> 23:41.585
      <i> Byron ran off</i>
      <i> with the Reverend</i>
      <i> and Kyle Barnes</i>

23:41.587 --> 23:44.522
     <i> and left me to babysit</i>
     <i> Barnes' little girl</i>
     <i> and her cousin.</i>

23:44.524 --> 23:47.291
    <i> The girls are terrified,</i>
    <i> and so am I.</i>

23:48.693 --> 23:50.394
    <i> Kat, please.</i>

23:50.396 --> 23:53.631
 I don't know anything about it,
 but I'm sure it'll be okay.

23:53.633 --> 23:57.401
     Um, I have to run,
     but I-- I'll call you back.
<i>Kat, wait. Don't go.</i>

23:57.403 --> 23:58.702
      <i> Hold on!</i>
            Bye.

24:40.579 --> 24:41.645
        (knock on door)

24:48.587 --> 24:49.787
What is it?

24:49.789 --> 24:52.356
           Does the police chief
           live here?

24:52.358 --> 24:53.524
Who are you?

24:53.526 --> 24:54.925
          Aaron McCready.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.260
           He knows me.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.795
Okay, well, if you're
in trouble, Aaron,

24:57.797 --> 24:59.497
 you call 911.
        No, I can't.

24:59.499 --> 25:00.831
          Is he here?

25:04.135 --> 25:05.970
     Look, something's going on.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.371
What are you talking about?

25:07.373 --> 25:09.039
       His friend, the Reverend.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.509
 All that stuff he's been saying
 about the devil coming to town,

25:11.511 --> 25:12.877
         it's no joke.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.144
Okay, you get on home now.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.546
                 No. Please!

25:15.548 --> 25:17.548
  I will tell him
  you were here.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.682
                         Please.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.051
            Don't make me go
            back out there.

25:24.623 --> 25:25.823
All right, son.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.458
You wait right here,
and I'll give him a call.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.595
    Ain't gonna worry about it.

25:44.843 --> 25:46.944
             Megan!
                ANDERSON: Easy.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.080
Rev.

26:03.361 --> 26:05.629
Why come here
if it's so full
of bad memories?

26:08.233 --> 26:10.367
        My bad memories.

26:10.369 --> 26:12.503
             Not hers.

26:12.505 --> 26:15.239
              You said they want
              to feel safe.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.674
               She wasn't coming
               to this house.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.442
             She was coming here
             to find me.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.783
          We gotta look outside.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.318
        (phone ringing)

26:29.020 --> 26:31.422
                It's Giles.

26:31.424 --> 26:34.124
           I'm here, Chief.
There was a break-in
at my house.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.726
It was that McCready kid.

26:35.728 --> 26:38.762
   Now, I find that little shit,
   I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.532
               What'd he take?
<i>Not what. Who.</i>

26:42.601 --> 26:44.902
  <i> He took Barnes' daughter.</i>

26:44.904 --> 26:47.805
    <i> He said he was</i>
    <i> delivering a message.</i>

26:47.807 --> 26:49.273
ANDERSON:
From who?

26:50.375 --> 26:52.209
         I think you know.

26:56.247 --> 26:57.881
   What is it?

26:57.883 --> 26:59.583
                   He has Amber.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.118
          (door opens)

27:05.590 --> 27:06.957
   Kyle, wait.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.792
This is about more than us.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.561
          He is a false prophet.

27:10.563 --> 27:12.997
           If we don't stop him,
           the devil will reign
           for a thousand years.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.832
You really believe that?

27:14.834 --> 27:16.233
     That that man
     is the devil,

27:16.235 --> 27:18.402
and that you have to stop him,
no matter what?

27:18.404 --> 27:19.603
       Yes, I do.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.639
    Then don't you see,
    you can't come with me?

27:21.641 --> 27:25.242
           You-- you and I,
           we may not agree
           on what this evil is,

27:25.244 --> 27:27.277
     where the power
     to defeat it comes from God

27:27.279 --> 27:28.679
             or from some place
             I don't understand.

27:28.681 --> 27:31.682
         But there is one thing
         that I see clearly now,

27:31.684 --> 27:33.150
           and I believe
           with all of my heart.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.821
             That if this battle
             is to be won,

27:37.823 --> 27:39.490
          it can't be won alone.

27:40.959 --> 27:43.360
  You're probably right, Rev.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.163
  But for me,
  this isn't about the devil.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.165
   This is about my daughter.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.433
         And that's it.

27:54.606 --> 27:58.442
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

28:33.078 --> 28:35.045
      Where's my daughter?

28:37.415 --> 28:40.217
I love old American cars.

28:42.387 --> 28:47.257
They used to call this
a three-body trunk.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.959
       You said you were
       bringing her back.

28:49.994 --> 28:51.228
       Get in.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.405
          Where is she?

29:01.407 --> 29:04.241
We can go round and round
on this all night.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.543
You can keep
asking me questions.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.079
You can threaten me.
You can hurt me.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.714
You can kill me.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.883
The only way you're gonna
see your little girl again

29:12.885 --> 29:15.252
is if you stop talking
and get in.

29:19.858 --> 29:22.593
        Now, put this
        over your head.

29:27.198 --> 29:30.234
             What is it about me
             that makes this
             all worthwhile?

29:30.236 --> 29:34.304
Put that over your head.
You'll get your answers.
