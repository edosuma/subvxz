00:12.664 --> 00:14.753
[phone vibrating]

00:20.107 --> 00:22.761
[sighs]

00:22.805 --> 00:25.982
Hey, Jake. What's up?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.028
What? When? How?

00:29.377 --> 00:31.161
[groans]

00:31.205 --> 00:34.164
So, who told you?

00:34.208 --> 00:35.600
[sighs]

00:35.644 --> 00:38.995
Mm. Mm.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.171
Well, I'm sure
you can handle it.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.826
Call me when you get down there.

00:43.869 --> 00:46.655
Okay, sure thing. Bye.

00:46.698 --> 00:49.832
What's happening
with your brother?

00:49.875 --> 00:52.182
Oh, nothing. My dad died.

00:53.444 --> 00:56.099
Jason. What happened?

00:56.143 --> 00:59.668
Well, these... these people

00:59.711 --> 01:02.714
that knew him from the apartment
complex he lives in,

01:02.758 --> 01:04.107
they hadn't seen him
for a few days,

01:04.151 --> 01:06.066
so they... they called the super

01:06.109 --> 01:08.285
who called the Tampa PD,

01:08.329 --> 01:11.288
and they went in and found him
on the kitchen floor.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.420
He hadn't moved
in some time, it was...

01:12.463 --> 01:13.899
Oh...

01:13.943 --> 01:16.250
...heart attack or something.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.078
Jake's on his way down
right now.

01:18.121 --> 01:20.080
Hey, baby, I'm so sorry.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.603
Yeah.

01:23.866 --> 01:27.087
I feel like I want
scrambled eggs.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.132
You want some eggs?

01:36.487 --> 01:38.924
Izzy called. Jason...

01:38.968 --> 01:40.317
I know.Anything I can do.

01:40.361 --> 01:41.840
Oh, it's okay.Anything at all.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.015
Thanks.CHUNK: Hey, man.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.191
Hey.It's tough.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.757
Anything I can do for you?

01:45.801 --> 01:47.368
No, it's all right.Will there be a service?

01:47.411 --> 01:48.673
You know, my brother's
taking care of all that.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.588
How you doing?I'm good.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.068
If there's anything I can do...You know what? Thank you.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.244
I appreciate it. I really do.

01:54.288 --> 01:57.421
Uh, I think the best thing
for me right now is...

01:57.465 --> 01:59.902
just to get to work.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.426
All right, then.Sure.

02:02.470 --> 02:03.819
Oh, there was a delivery.
Uh, came this morning.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.603
It's on your desk.

02:05.647 --> 02:07.779
Thanks.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.653
[exhales]

02:22.707 --> 02:24.361
[sighs]

02:41.291 --> 02:43.337
[birds chirping]

02:45.600 --> 02:47.384
[indistinct chatter][horn honking]

02:50.518 --> 02:52.520
[shouts]
Get out of the way!

02:52.563 --> 02:53.738
Move!

02:53.782 --> 02:55.827
[tires screeching]

02:58.003 --> 02:59.353
[dog barking]

03:04.184 --> 03:06.490
Hey, I'm sorry, uh...

03:06.534 --> 03:10.581
this may sound like
a strange question, but, uh,

03:10.625 --> 03:11.713
where are we?

03:13.018 --> 03:13.976
You're in Brooklyn.

03:14.019 --> 03:14.803
This is Park Slope.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.153
What time is it?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.763
It's, uh, quarter to 3:00.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.635
That's not possible.

03:20.678 --> 03:25.857
Oh, I was just in my office
and-and it was... 10:00.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.598
Um, can I, can I borrow
your phone?

03:27.642 --> 03:29.252
'cause I-I don't have mine.

03:29.296 --> 03:32.734
Yeah, I-I don't...
I don't think so.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.301
Come on.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.563
[softly]:
All right.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.898
COHEN:
Jason?

04:07.986 --> 04:09.205
Nate.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.381
Why are you lurking
outside my door?

04:11.425 --> 04:13.731
I was looking for you.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.473
You haven't been around since
you finished your doctorate.

04:16.517 --> 04:19.520
I assumed you'd forgotten
about me, as students do.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.000
Forget the best teacher
I ever had? I don't think so.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.438
Save the flattery for someone
young enough to believe it.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.703
I trained you
to be a clinician, Jason.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.618
To treat patients.

04:30.661 --> 04:33.185
You abandoned psychology,
to do what--

04:33.229 --> 04:34.622
fix parking tickets?

04:34.665 --> 04:36.276
Trial analysis.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.625
Same difference.

04:37.668 --> 04:38.843
Well, we can agree to disagree.

04:38.887 --> 04:41.411
I have a problem.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.326
I've lost five hours.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.459
Lost.
You have no memory of them?

04:45.502 --> 04:48.853
I was in my office.
It was morning.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.855
And the next thing,

04:50.899 --> 04:53.075
it was afternoon and I was here.

04:53.118 --> 04:55.382
And I have no consciousness

04:55.425 --> 04:58.385
of the intervening hours
or what I did.

04:58.428 --> 05:01.083
Any signs of a recent
head injury,

05:01.126 --> 05:03.346
concussion,
nausea, headache?

05:03.390 --> 05:04.521
No.

05:04.565 --> 05:05.914
On any medication?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.916
[scoffs]
I'm barely on Scotch these days.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.614
Well, by all means,
see many doctors

05:10.658 --> 05:12.399
and have lots
of expensive tests,

05:12.442 --> 05:15.097
but I suspect it's an episode

05:15.140 --> 05:17.447
of transient global amnesia.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.623
Do you have a history
of heart disease?

05:19.667 --> 05:20.624
Yes.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.365
That makes it more likely.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.888
It's usually
brought on by stress

05:23.932 --> 05:25.890
or very strenuous activity.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.893
Any stress recently?

05:28.937 --> 05:30.504
My father died.

05:30.547 --> 05:31.548
Oh.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.682
I'm sorry.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.771
Yeah, we weren't that close,
and I don't think that's...

05:36.814 --> 05:40.252
a big enough event
to cause an episode like this.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.646
The thing is, I was...

05:42.690 --> 05:45.301
in my office
and I was looking at something.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.696
But I can't remember
what it was.

05:48.739 --> 05:51.699
Some short-term memory loss
is to be expected.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.265
You'll figure it out.
Nice to see you, Jason.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.093
Nate, something
provoked this,

05:55.137 --> 05:57.574
something important, and I can't
put my finger on it. I...

05:59.533 --> 06:03.363
I'd really like
to talk to you about this.

06:03.406 --> 06:07.018
I haven't worked with patients
in a very long time.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.674
You'll have no trouble
finding someone to talk to.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.110
It's Brooklyn,
you can't throw a stick

06:12.154 --> 06:13.460
without hitting a therapist.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.200
You used to say
it's not the crisis

06:15.244 --> 06:17.464
that defines the patient,

06:17.507 --> 06:19.553
but their response to it.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.426
I lost my memory,

06:23.470 --> 06:26.951
and I ended up
a block from your apartment.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.389
I don't think
that's an accident.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.477
Please.

06:33.001 --> 06:36.352
You're interrupting a very full
morning of doing nothing.

06:37.614 --> 06:38.789
Come in.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.751
I did actually get
a parking ticket recently.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.753
I can't help you with that.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.842
â™ª

06:55.676 --> 06:57.765
Well, this place
hasn't changed, has it?

06:57.808 --> 06:59.506
Same books,
same furniture.

07:00.681 --> 07:02.944
And this rug.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.989
Have you ever had
this rug cleaned?

07:05.033 --> 07:08.210
If I'd known you were coming,
I would have called a decorator.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.255
Tissue box is empty.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.606
Then I guess
you can't cry.

07:12.649 --> 07:15.173
Jason, procrastination
is a form

07:15.217 --> 07:16.566
of passive-aggressive
resistance.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.439
So cut the crap
and sit down, will you?

07:22.485 --> 07:24.792
I'd forgotten
how cuddly you aren't.

07:24.835 --> 07:26.620
You want a cuddle?
There's a pillow.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.841
Your father died.
Let's start there.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.365
Tell me about him.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.630
Whip-smart, fast talker.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.241
Never delivered on a promise.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.286
You weren't close.

07:41.330 --> 07:44.289
He left the family
when I was a teenager.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.291
I decided at that time that

07:46.335 --> 07:47.858
I would have
nothing to do with him.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.034
And in 30 years,

07:50.078 --> 07:53.342
I haven't found any reason
to change my mind.

07:53.385 --> 07:56.084
You never tried to reconnect,
make peace?

07:56.127 --> 07:58.260
In the end,
I never saw the point.

07:58.303 --> 08:01.089
It's not like
he was gonna change.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.873
Apologize.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.615
Jake got along with him,

08:05.659 --> 08:08.575
'cause they're made the same.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.054
Your brother, where is he now?

08:10.098 --> 08:11.186
He is down in Florida,

08:11.229 --> 08:13.667
arranging things.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.496
And, uh, I'm happy
to let him do that, I've...

08:18.498 --> 08:21.283
I'll pay for the funeral.

08:21.326 --> 08:24.634
And that will be the only thing

08:24.678 --> 08:26.506
my father gets from me.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.249
Can we talk about
something else?

08:31.293 --> 08:33.425
You have a family now?

08:33.469 --> 08:35.863
I do.

08:35.906 --> 08:38.474
A daughter and a wife.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.737
Any stress there recently?

08:41.782 --> 08:43.174
You could say that.

08:43.218 --> 08:44.262
IZZY: Jason!

08:45.350 --> 08:46.917
[crying]

08:46.961 --> 08:48.353
Where's Astrid?I don't know.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.877
[muffled shout]

08:49.920 --> 08:51.531
No, no, no. What's going on?

08:51.574 --> 08:53.315
He took her. He had a gun.

08:53.358 --> 08:54.708
Had a gun.Who? Who took her?

08:54.751 --> 08:56.536
[phone ringing]

09:06.894 --> 09:08.896
Where's my daughter?

09:08.939 --> 09:12.116
You didn't hear about this?
It was in the news.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.729
Must have missed it.

09:15.772 --> 09:19.384
I can't imagine how horrible
that must have felt.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.390
Weirdly, it didn't

09:25.434 --> 09:29.177
feel like anything, really.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.527
It was an out-of-body
experience.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.270
I was floating up
near the ceiling,

09:35.313 --> 09:37.533
looking down on myself.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.970
And Izzy.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.451
What did the police say
when you called them?

09:44.061 --> 09:45.585
We didn't call the police.

09:45.628 --> 09:46.498
DISTORTED VOICE:
Do you have the money?

09:46.542 --> 09:48.979
Yes, I have the money.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.373
The million dollars,
just like you asked for.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.157
Tell me where to go.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.594
You'll receive
further instructions

09:54.637 --> 09:56.421
once you're on the road.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.554
Remember, no police.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.729
[dial tone]

10:01.035 --> 10:02.776
IZZY:
I don't like this.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.473
I don't like you
going out there alone.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.561
Danny's following me,
Taylor's got trackers

10:05.605 --> 10:06.780
on my watch,Taylor is one person.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.477
on my phone.I want an army.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.435
I want helicopters in the sky.We can't do that.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.785
We don't want to tip them off.

10:11.828 --> 10:14.004
If we panic, they panic.
We stick to the plan.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.093
There is no plan.
Jason, there's no plan.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.965
I went along with this
because I thought your team

10:18.008 --> 10:19.836
would figure out
who took Astrid and have

10:19.880 --> 10:21.925
some kind of special insight
in getting her back,

10:21.969 --> 10:24.188
but-but you don't know
who these people are,

10:24.232 --> 10:25.320
you don't know where they are,
you know nothing.Now listen,

10:25.363 --> 10:27.627
I don't know who they are,

10:27.670 --> 10:30.586
but we know they did this
to get to me, and I...

10:30.630 --> 10:33.415
I'm the one who has to fix it.

10:33.458 --> 10:36.200
You always say the best
way to win a negotiation

10:36.244 --> 10:37.767
is to never let them see
the fear in your eyes.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.640
Well, I can see the fear
in your eyes, Jason.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.729
And this time,we have

10:42.772 --> 10:44.469
everything to lose.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.950
I got to go.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.648
Please.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.432
She's my daughter, too.
If anything happens,

10:50.475 --> 10:52.390
I will never forgive myselfYou'll never forgive me. I know.

10:52.434 --> 10:56.873
for-for not calling the police,
for not just s-screaming

10:56.917 --> 10:59.006
and fighting and kicking
and just doing everything I can

10:59.049 --> 11:00.050
to get my daughter back.Okay, okay.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.102
I promise you I'm gonna
get our daughter back.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.501
COHEN:
Your wife was right.

11:16.545 --> 11:19.069
You did have everything to lose.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.898
By refusing help,
you took sole responsibility

11:21.942 --> 11:23.552
for your daughter's safety.

11:23.595 --> 11:26.120
Well, I didn't have a choice.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.513
They told us
not to call the police.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.472
Don't kidnappers
always say that,

11:30.515 --> 11:32.692
and don't most people
call the police anyway?

11:32.735 --> 11:36.826
Okay, the situation

11:36.870 --> 11:40.482
was that kidnapper was
the mother of a teenage boy

11:40.525 --> 11:42.484
who used to be a patient
of mine and he died,

11:42.527 --> 11:44.486
and she held me responsible.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.662
She didn't want Astrid,
she didn't want money.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.229
She wanted me. I had to go.

11:48.272 --> 11:49.796
It had to be me.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.974
What were you feeling
when you went?

11:54.017 --> 11:57.542
That I would do anything
to ensure Astrid's safety.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.283
And?

12:00.850 --> 12:03.287
That I was probably gonna die.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.728
This is for Simon.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.469
You know what I remember
about Simon?

12:11.513 --> 12:13.297
You took him to
an amusement park

12:13.341 --> 12:14.734
for his 12th birthday.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.475
Right? It was his 12th birthday.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.782
And he knew you were
afraid of heights,

12:19.826 --> 12:21.871
but he said that
you took him

12:21.915 --> 12:24.831
on this massive
roller coaster anyway.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.268
And he knew how scared you were.

12:27.311 --> 12:30.358
And he thought
that was so cool

12:30.401 --> 12:34.449
that you would
face your fears like that.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.712
For him.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.105
Drop your weapon!
Hands in the air!No! No, stop it!

12:38.148 --> 12:39.628
I said drop!Don't shoot!

12:39.671 --> 12:41.195
BULL:
Don't shoot, I've got this.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.762
Don't shoot.CHERYL: Stay back! Stay back!

12:42.805 --> 12:43.719
BULL:
Everything's gonna be okay.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.635
Everything's
gonna be all right.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.159
You know what happened
right before I got here?

12:49.203 --> 12:52.162
My wife told me
that she'd never forgive herself

12:52.206 --> 12:55.557
if she didn't do
every single thing she could

12:55.600 --> 12:56.950
to save our daughter.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.953
And that's all you're doing
right now.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.911
You want to do
every single thing you can

13:01.955 --> 13:03.783
to avenge Simon.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.742
But you don't have to.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.919
He knew how much you loved him.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.487
No matter how much
he was hurting,

13:12.530 --> 13:14.794
he knew.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.014
[gun clatters on ground]

13:18.058 --> 13:19.755
[sobbing]

13:19.799 --> 13:21.626
[shrieking, sobbing]

13:23.585 --> 13:25.456
It's okay.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.980
CHERYL:
No!

13:29.199 --> 13:30.940
That was profoundly
traumatic.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.377
Ah.Don't diminish it.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.380
An experience like
that changes you.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.643
You said something
you saw in your office

13:38.687 --> 13:40.210
triggered the episode.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.909
Could it have been connected
to the kidnapping?

13:42.952 --> 13:45.607
I don't think so.
It doesn't feel right.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.870
Well, anyway,
the woman took a plea deal.

13:47.914 --> 13:51.004
Yes? That must have
been a relief.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.744
Wait a second,
how do you know that?

13:52.788 --> 13:53.920
Hmm?

13:53.963 --> 13:55.617
Well, you just told me that

13:55.660 --> 13:59.012
you had not heard
anything about this case.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.449
So how do you know that
Cheryl Werth took a plea deal?

14:02.885 --> 14:05.322
I must have read about it
and forgotten.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.455
Oh.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.023
Well, that doesn't
sound like you.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.416
You're the sharpest mind
I've ever known.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.375
I'm old, Jason.

14:14.418 --> 14:17.247
I'd forget my butt
if it wasn't stuck to me.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.466
You want coffee?

14:18.509 --> 14:19.859
I'll make some.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.819
IZZY:
Any sign of him?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.213
No. The security cameras show

14:26.256 --> 14:27.823
that Bull left the office
around 10:00,

14:27.867 --> 14:29.433
just a few minutes
after he got in.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.000
That was hours ago.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.915
Did he say anything
before he left?

14:32.959 --> 14:35.657
Uh, no, he made it clear
that he wanted to be alone,

14:35.700 --> 14:37.398
so that's what we did.

14:37.441 --> 14:38.921
The news about his father,
it did something to him.

14:38.965 --> 14:39.966
He didn't want
to talk about it,

14:40.009 --> 14:41.924
but I could tell
that he was upset.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.665
You can track his phone, right?

14:43.708 --> 14:45.232
It's here.
He left it on his desk.

14:45.275 --> 14:48.017
Okay, any his recent
emails, messages?

14:48.061 --> 14:49.932
Don't pretend
you haven't looked.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.456
I might have taken a quick look.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.328
There's nothing about a meeting
or appointment today.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.286
I spoke with my friend
at the NYPD,

14:56.330 --> 14:58.462
and she's sympathetic,
but they're gonna need more than

14:58.506 --> 15:00.638
"He's been gone for a couple
of hours" to do anything.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.640
Look, I understand
why you're worried,

15:02.684 --> 15:04.468
but let's be honest, we've
all seen Bull do stuff

15:04.512 --> 15:05.948
that didn't make sense at first.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.037
Look, you know
he lives in his head.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.518
Maybe he just needed
to get away and think.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.086
No. He wouldn't do it this way.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.218
He knows I would worry, he
would have said something.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.524
We'll keep looking.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.568
I really think he's okay.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.702
No. He's not.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.106
Oh, man, that is good.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.499
[scoffs]
What's the name of the stuff

15:35.543 --> 15:37.066
you put in this again?

15:37.110 --> 15:38.111
Chicory.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.808
Chicory. That's right.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.377
Whenever I smell this,
I think about you

15:43.420 --> 15:44.900
and this room.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.120
So, your daughter
was kidnapped.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.165
I assume that's
the most stressful thing

15:49.209 --> 15:51.080
that's happened recently?

15:51.124 --> 15:54.605
Well, I did get
a little arrested.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.042
Judge Hopkins.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.260
Hello, everybody.

15:57.304 --> 15:58.479
What's the FBI doing here?

15:58.522 --> 15:59.610
HOPKINS:
There's been a development

15:59.654 --> 16:02.352
in the Smokestack class action.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.701
What's the development?

16:03.745 --> 16:05.747
The U.S. Attorney's Office
received

16:05.790 --> 16:06.791
an anonymous tip
that there had been

16:06.835 --> 16:08.706
interference with the jury.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.795
One of the jurors

16:10.839 --> 16:12.145
said that he'd been bribed.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.407
Bribed? By who?

16:13.450 --> 16:16.105
By you.[laughs] What?

16:16.149 --> 16:17.498
Yeah, that-that's ridiculous.
Wha...

16:17.541 --> 16:19.369
You're just gonna take
the word of this juror?

16:19.413 --> 16:20.588
AGENT:We have corroborating
evidence that

16:20.631 --> 16:22.329
Dr. Bull made direct
contact with this juror.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.592
HOPKINS:
To answer your earlier
question, Dr. Bull,

16:24.635 --> 16:26.942
I'm afraid the agents are here
to take you into custody.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.291
AGENT:
Dr. Jason Bull,
you're under arrest

16:28.335 --> 16:29.727
for the crime
of jury tampering.

16:30.815 --> 16:33.035
It was a class action suit.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.820
We were suing a manufacturer
of vape pens.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.605
And you won.Yes, we did. Big.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.433
$150 million.

16:39.476 --> 16:42.914
Which they claimed was
because you bribed a juror.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.308
With my wife, actually.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.964
That we somehow
conspired together.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.097
That must have been
easy to disprove.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.534
Not as easy as you'd think.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.231
I've been thinking about
a different approach

16:55.275 --> 16:56.841
to the trial.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.539
Olivia and I could
put together a proffer

16:58.582 --> 17:00.758
in which I agreed
to plead guiltyProffer?

17:00.802 --> 17:02.630
to a lesser charge
in exchangeWhoa.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.284
Wha...for a reduced sentence.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.328
There's a good chance
we could get him down

17:05.372 --> 17:06.590
a few years,
which isn't bad.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.723
Martha Stewart
did five months.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.420
D-Don't you dare joke
about this.She's a tough bird.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.206
Why would you plead guilty
for something you didn't do?

17:15.643 --> 17:17.079
We would make it a condition

17:17.123 --> 17:18.559
that Reilly drop
any prosecution of you.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.562
You'd be safe.What?

17:21.605 --> 17:23.346
Don't make this about me.

17:23.390 --> 17:24.956
It's not about you.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.262
It's about Astrid.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.221
I know...

17:28.264 --> 17:31.833
that you think that
this is a way of saving

17:31.876 --> 17:34.009
Astrid and me, but don't.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.316
I'm not a damsel in distress.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.144
And if our daughter needs
saving, we do it together.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.190
You know, I'm terrified

17:41.234 --> 17:43.453
about the way all of this
could turn out, too.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.629
But being afraid doesn't mean
that you stop fighting.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.283
It means that you fight harder.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.243
Izzy, I'm just trying
to be realistic here.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.809
COHEN:
I know they didn't
find you guilty,

17:51.853 --> 17:54.029
because you're here.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.596
How did you convince them?

17:55.639 --> 17:57.598
I confessed.

17:57.641 --> 18:01.297
I don't understand.
You said you weren't guilty.

18:01.341 --> 18:05.040
I wasn't. And I was.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.650
OLIVIA:
What happened that night

18:06.694 --> 18:08.913
at Randall Hughes' house?

18:08.957 --> 18:11.133
I sat in my car,
and I watched Coach Hughes

18:11.177 --> 18:12.787
take his trash to the curb.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.398
Is that it?

18:15.442 --> 18:16.399
That's all you did that night?

18:17.400 --> 18:19.185
No.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.839
I got out of the car.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.189
And why did you get
out of your car?

18:27.845 --> 18:30.761
To bribe Randall Hughes.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.067
OLIVIA:
I'm sorry, Dr. Bull,
I'm confused.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.634
You just said

18:33.677 --> 18:36.071
you didn't offer him a bride.I didn't,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.073
but I thought about it

18:38.117 --> 18:41.076
for a few seconds,
and then I thought better of it,

18:41.120 --> 18:42.730
and I got back in my car
and I drove home.

18:42.773 --> 18:46.081
But in that time...

18:46.125 --> 18:47.691
[sighs]

18:47.735 --> 18:49.780
We were desperate.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.956
I was fighting
on behalf of

18:52.000 --> 18:54.176
so many people
in this class action suit,

18:54.220 --> 18:56.570
and we were...

18:56.613 --> 18:58.659
trapped, and I...

19:00.574 --> 19:02.097
...was selfish,
and I put my team at risk,

19:02.141 --> 19:05.318
their reputations
and their livelihoods.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.886
And I am ashamed of myself
for that.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.367
But most of all, my wife

19:11.411 --> 19:14.240
and my child,
to bring them into this mess,

19:14.283 --> 19:17.330
that I regret most of all.

19:18.418 --> 19:19.984
COHEN:
Tell me about Izzy.

19:22.509 --> 19:27.035
[sighs]
Izzy is everything.

19:27.078 --> 19:30.778
She and Astrid
are the center of my life.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.824
Which is ironic,
since I nearly lost her.

19:33.868 --> 19:34.869
What do you mean?

19:34.912 --> 19:36.305
Well, we were married...

19:37.611 --> 19:39.395
...before, years ago.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.705
But we had a miscarriage and

19:44.748 --> 19:46.576
we couldn't
hold it together and...

19:48.970 --> 19:52.930
I... There was someone else,

19:52.974 --> 19:55.803
for a little bit, but it was...

19:55.846 --> 19:58.501
it was Izzy.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.895
And it just took a long time

20:00.938 --> 20:03.941
until I could admit

20:03.985 --> 20:06.335
what she meant to me.

20:06.379 --> 20:08.424
What convinced you?

20:08.468 --> 20:12.211
Probably the fact she was
about to marry someone else.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.212
[knocking]

20:16.476 --> 20:17.955
Oh, my goodness.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.612
[door closes]

20:22.656 --> 20:23.439
[laughs softly]

20:25.659 --> 20:27.313
You-you want a drink?

20:27.356 --> 20:30.794
Yes. God, yes.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.622
But don't give me one.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.192
It's nice.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.759
Want to buy it?
I'm getting married.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.413
[chuckles]
I heard.

20:42.632 --> 20:45.548
I wanted to tell
you. Um, I called,

20:45.592 --> 20:48.682
but you were never
there, so I...

20:48.725 --> 20:51.598
I figured it was a sign.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.774
No.

20:53.817 --> 20:54.818
It's all good.

20:56.690 --> 20:59.040
I'm happy for you.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.998
You don't look happy.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.827
Happy for you, sad for me.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.136
You're a great lady, lady.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.835
Is that what you came
over here to tell me?

21:11.879 --> 21:14.577
I'm sorry it didn't...

21:14.621 --> 21:16.275
work for us.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.846
I would have really liked

21:22.890 --> 21:24.935
for it to have worked.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.680
But I'm glad you found someone.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.902
I wish the same for you.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.600
Hmm.
[sniffles]

21:37.644 --> 21:40.690
Can I tell
you something?

21:40.734 --> 21:42.431
Something I don't think
you know about yourself?

21:45.173 --> 21:48.045
I don't think
you're good alone, Jason.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.397
I don't.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.836
You may be
on to something there.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.446
COHEN:
What happened?

21:57.490 --> 22:01.320
She left her fiancÃ©
and you got married?

22:01.363 --> 22:03.844
No. She married him.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.063
How did you and she
get back together?

22:06.107 --> 22:09.153
Well, it's a funny thing.

22:09.197 --> 22:11.199
Her father died.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.853
I saw Izzy at the funeral.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.334
Well, that couldn't
have been a surprise.

22:15.377 --> 22:19.773
She looked so... fragile.

22:19.816 --> 22:22.123
That couldn't have been
a surprise, either.

22:22.166 --> 22:25.082
I didn't know what to do.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.868
I didn't do any of it very well.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.739
What did you want to do?

22:29.783 --> 22:31.393
[exhales]

22:31.437 --> 22:34.396
I wanted to save her.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.485
I've always wanted to save her.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.531
[bed creaks]

22:43.013 --> 22:45.364
I got to go.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.370
[crying softly]

22:56.462 --> 22:58.507
[sniffles]

23:21.661 --> 23:23.967
Don't give me that look.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.534
That's not the first time
you've heard someone

23:25.578 --> 23:27.014
talk about sex at a funeral.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.016
Anyway,

23:29.059 --> 23:31.366
that is how Izzy
got pregnant with Astrid.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.499
And that's when
you got married.

23:33.542 --> 23:34.935
No.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.632
When she gave birth?

23:36.676 --> 23:37.851
No.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.418
You are married?

23:40.767 --> 23:42.072
It took a while.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.727
Interesting.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.296
Interesting.
What's interesting?

23:48.339 --> 23:50.472
You don't see the connection?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.518
No. What?

23:52.561 --> 23:54.302
Jason, I used to think of you

23:54.345 --> 23:57.261
as one of my most
insightful students.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.655
Do you honestly not see this?

23:59.699 --> 24:02.397
Seriously, I... Nate,
you got to help me out here.

24:04.007 --> 24:07.315
You have a fragile,
precious relationship

24:07.358 --> 24:08.490
with Izzy
and Astrid.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.840
Your center,
as you put it.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.626
Twice in the recent past
it's been threatened.

24:13.669 --> 24:16.846
Once by a kidnapping,
once with prison.

24:16.890 --> 24:20.415
Both times you took on
the burden of saving it.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.244
It seems logical
that the trigger

24:23.287 --> 24:27.074
for the episode
was another threat.

24:27.117 --> 24:30.251
One you feared you couldn't
save your family from.

24:30.294 --> 24:33.210
Okay. So what would that be?

24:34.473 --> 24:35.865
You.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.171
What?

24:37.214 --> 24:39.303
Think it through.

24:39.347 --> 24:42.611
You think I'm a threat
to my family?

24:42.655 --> 24:46.093
I'm saying that's
what you think.

24:46.136 --> 24:50.532
Jason, what did this episode
of amnesia allow you to do?

24:50.576 --> 24:52.142
Functionally?I don't know.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.231
It let you disappear.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.799
Poof. You came here,
where no one will look for you.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.497
You're in hiding.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.848
Why would you do that
if you weren't afraid?

25:01.891 --> 25:04.677
What could convince me
I was a threat to my family?

25:04.720 --> 25:06.679
I don't know.

25:06.722 --> 25:08.463
Maybe it has something to do
with that envelope

25:08.507 --> 25:10.378
in your jacket pocket.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.253
I didn't even know
that was there.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.603
How did you know that was there?

25:17.646 --> 25:19.387
I am, in fact, an
omniscient being

25:19.430 --> 25:22.042
who knows all things.

25:22.085 --> 25:24.653
Also, I saw it just now.

25:24.697 --> 25:27.526
Open it.
I want to know what's inside.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.746
[sighs]

25:34.445 --> 25:38.537
It's a check for $44.7 million.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.365
Now we're getting somewhere.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.201
COHEN:
Nearly $45 million.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.899
That's real money.

25:52.942 --> 25:57.164
Yeah. It's the, uh,
fee for the class action.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.948
We work on a contingency.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.776
This is a third
of the total award.

26:00.820 --> 26:05.346
I just... I didn't know
it was arriving today.

26:05.389 --> 26:08.610
It's what you saw in the office,
the trigger for the episode.

26:08.654 --> 26:11.787
Why would this make me feel
like a threat to my family?

26:11.831 --> 26:13.528
What does it mean to you?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.443
More money for TAC.

26:15.486 --> 26:18.315
Uh... it's more clients,

26:18.359 --> 26:21.188
more staff, more cases.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.625
More travel?

26:23.669 --> 26:25.366
Which would mean more work...
Is this about work?

26:25.409 --> 26:26.933
That doesn't feel right.

26:26.976 --> 26:29.892
No, it doesn't.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.025
Tell me about TAC.

26:32.068 --> 26:35.898
Uh, we're a trial science firm.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.508
We shape the narrative
of a trial

26:37.552 --> 26:39.902
to suit the jurors we've picked.

26:39.946 --> 26:42.296
Pick jurors? How
do you do that?

26:42.339 --> 26:43.558
MARISSA:
$10,000

26:43.602 --> 26:45.342
for Hamiltontickets, day of.

26:45.386 --> 26:47.867
Fourth row center.
From a scalper.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.043
It's an absolutely justifiable
business expense.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.697
I had to pay off
the court clerk.

26:51.740 --> 26:54.830
Bull, I seriously doubt
the IRS will agree

26:54.874 --> 26:56.876
that illegal bribes
are deductible.

26:56.919 --> 27:00.357
Marissa, if I don't have a list
of the 75 potential jurors

27:00.401 --> 27:02.142
that make up the jury pool
at least a couple days

27:02.185 --> 27:03.970
before I walk
into that courtroom,

27:04.013 --> 27:05.798
then all of those people
on the other side of that door

27:05.841 --> 27:07.321
can't research them
and help me figure out

27:07.364 --> 27:09.149
if I want them or not.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.846
And since jury lists
are not supposed to be shared

27:10.890 --> 27:13.240
with either side...Exactly.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.024
the only way that I can
do my job is to have that list.

27:15.068 --> 27:18.375
Otherwise I'm just guessing,
and any fool can guess.

27:18.419 --> 27:21.030
So there's some
rule-breaking involved.

27:21.074 --> 27:23.424
I'm not gonna apologize
for getting information I need

27:23.467 --> 27:24.643
to help my clients.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.079
I'm not asking you to apologize.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.733
So this
information

27:27.776 --> 27:30.779
tells you who to pick
for your jury?

27:30.823 --> 27:32.433
Well, the information
only gets you so far.

27:32.476 --> 27:35.958
You got to question the jurors
to weed out the bad ones.

27:36.002 --> 27:38.831
You don't want
to let the other side know

27:38.874 --> 27:41.616
what you're doing,
so sometimes the questions

27:41.660 --> 27:44.401
have to be a little unorthodox.

27:44.445 --> 27:46.839
This case is about
government secrets.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.667
So what I would like
to speak to you about

27:48.710 --> 27:50.886
is canned goods.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.758
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's talk about cats.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.455
How many people here own cats?

27:55.935 --> 27:57.806
Any hopeless romantics
here today?

27:57.850 --> 28:00.853
Anyone here believe
in love at first sight?

28:00.896 --> 28:03.812
Today I want to talk
to you about rats.

28:03.856 --> 28:07.729
Is there anyone here
who rides horses,

28:07.773 --> 28:10.123
bungee jumps or skydives?CHUNK: I would like to

28:10.166 --> 28:12.647
talk to you all
a little bit about phobias.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.084
One of the most common phobias
is spiders.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.303
COHEN:
Rats, cats

28:16.346 --> 28:17.826
and spiders.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.567
Forgive me,
but your trial science

28:19.610 --> 28:22.004
doesn't sound that scientific.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.658
Kind of like psychology.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.399
It's more of a feeling.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.662
And that's what I do, I...

28:27.706 --> 28:30.665
you know, I watch people
and I observe

28:30.709 --> 28:33.233
their body language
and their facial expressions

28:33.276 --> 28:35.539
and I listen to the words
they choose,

28:35.583 --> 28:38.499
and then I try to figure out
what they're thinking.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.544
There you go.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.764
Thank you.BULL: Wonder if that's
his real hair.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.462
Let's see that wedding finger.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.029
Hmm. No ring.

28:47.073 --> 28:49.466
No indent of the finger flesh.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.730
Maybe he's actually single.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.732
[clears throat]
True story. No, it isn't.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.472
You just cleared your throat.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.083
Pretty good indicator
that you're about to lie.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.868
When Marissa and I met and
we were comparing histories,

28:59.912 --> 29:01.696
backstories, and she
told me she worked

29:01.740 --> 29:03.480
for Homeland Security,

29:03.524 --> 29:05.874
I was convinced it was
the name of a bank.

29:05.918 --> 29:09.312
[laughs] I'm sorry,
I still don't believe that.

29:09.356 --> 29:10.705
BULL:
Good. Neither do I.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.272
Oh, but it is a good story.

29:12.315 --> 29:13.447
It made you smile.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.405
It still makes me smile.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.799
The only reason I am here,
my dear, is to make you smile.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.192
[laughs]

29:19.235 --> 29:21.281
BULL:
I hate this guy.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.109
You said I used to be
really good at that.

29:23.152 --> 29:25.938
I think I said,
"I'd never seen anyone better."

29:25.981 --> 29:29.028
But let's get
back to TAC.

29:29.071 --> 29:32.031
Let me see if I've got
this right. You rig the jury...

29:32.074 --> 29:34.990
It's not rigging to select
jurors open to your argument.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.514
...and tell them
a version of the facts

29:37.558 --> 29:40.779
that leads to a verdict
you desire.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.693
I want to see my clients
get the justice they deserve.

29:42.737 --> 29:44.391
Again, I am not gonna apologize

29:44.434 --> 29:47.220
for doing everything I can
on their behalf.

29:47.263 --> 29:50.701
I'm not asking you to apologize.
Just that you be honest.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.094
What does that mean?

29:52.138 --> 29:54.749
"Do everything I can
on their behalf"?

29:54.793 --> 29:56.925
That phrase covers a lot,
doesn't it?

29:56.969 --> 29:57.883
What's your point?

29:59.928 --> 30:02.104
Time for me to be honest, Jason.

30:02.148 --> 30:05.847
I know things about you.
More than you might expect.

30:05.891 --> 30:09.459
For instance, what you did
to that elevator full of jurors.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.857
Whew. Going up?

30:16.902 --> 30:17.946
[elevator bell chimes]

30:17.990 --> 30:19.121
[clears throat]
Sorry.

30:20.601 --> 30:23.343
[metal creaking]

30:23.386 --> 30:24.997
[button clicks]

30:26.781 --> 30:28.957
Oh, no. Good, we're stuck.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.002
WOMAN:
No way.

30:30.045 --> 30:31.568
We can't be stuck.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.222
Oh, push the red button.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.485
What's your emergency?

30:35.529 --> 30:37.052
We got six people stuck in
an elevator at the courthouse.

30:37.096 --> 30:39.359
You got to send somebody
to get us out right away.

30:39.402 --> 30:41.143
Stand by, ma'am.

30:41.187 --> 30:42.405
How long?

30:42.449 --> 30:43.929
No longer than a few hours.

30:43.972 --> 30:45.626
[overlapping chatter]

30:45.669 --> 30:46.975
We're jurors in a trial.

30:48.716 --> 30:49.586
Do it.

30:51.719 --> 30:53.155
[metal thudding]

30:53.199 --> 30:54.243
WOMAN:
We can get out of here.

30:54.287 --> 30:55.462
I bet a medical emergency

30:55.505 --> 30:56.593
gets a response.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.813
Hi, uh,

30:58.857 --> 31:00.423
it's the elevator people again.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.903
We have someone in here
going into

31:01.947 --> 31:03.252
cardiac arrest.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.471
We need help
right now.

31:04.514 --> 31:05.907
It's a medical
emergency.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.953
Can you please
describe the symptoms?

31:07.996 --> 31:10.738
Chest pains, um,
red in the face,

31:10.781 --> 31:12.522
trouble breathing.
I'm pretty sure

31:12.566 --> 31:13.480
it's a coronary.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.047
And that's it.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.483
That's what we're
looking for.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.441
We got them.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.617
[machinery whirring]

31:20.661 --> 31:22.532
[laughs]:
Oh.

31:22.576 --> 31:23.838
MARISSA:
Luckily, the power's back up.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.013
I contacted the fire department

31:25.057 --> 31:27.015
and they're sending EMTs
right away.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.712
WOMAN:
Never mind. False alarm.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.018
[elevator bell chimes]

31:33.065 --> 31:35.719
Word of advice? Take the stairs.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.634
How'd you know about that?

31:37.678 --> 31:40.420
What can I say?
I've kept my eye on you.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.378
I was trying to make
the jury understand

31:42.422 --> 31:43.945
why someone would make up
a story under pressure.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.555
And it worked.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.557
Seriously,
how'd you know about that?

31:47.601 --> 31:50.952
Making the jury understand?

31:50.996 --> 31:53.955
Is that what prompted
the incident in Texas?

31:53.999 --> 31:56.001
[siren wailing]DARLING:
Okay. Put a pin in this.

31:56.044 --> 31:57.524
Let's go.

31:57.567 --> 32:01.093
Jury, everybody,
let's get down to the shelter.

32:10.450 --> 32:12.104
Bull, get inside,

32:12.147 --> 32:14.845
you dummy, there's
a tornado coming.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.586
Is there?

32:16.630 --> 32:18.240
Yeah, I mean, it's lit up
all over social media.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.460
Look, they're tweeting
about it a town over.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.288
CABLE [over video]:
Once again, there's a severe

32:22.331 --> 32:24.464
tornado warning
issued for all of Callisto.

32:24.507 --> 32:25.682
While everyone in Callisto

32:25.726 --> 32:27.815
should immediately find shelter,

32:27.858 --> 32:30.426
a tornado watch has been issued
for neighboring counties.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.080
Ah.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.823
My responsibility
is to my clients,

32:35.866 --> 32:38.086
and if I find an imaginative way
to advance their case,

32:38.130 --> 32:40.132
I don't see anything wrong
with that.

32:40.175 --> 32:43.483
See nothing wrong
with it? You love it.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.789
You've always had to be the
smartest guy in the room,

32:45.833 --> 32:48.923
and we both know smart guys
don't follow the rules.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.317
You prefer a crooked path

32:51.360 --> 32:53.797
because the straight
and narrow bores you.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.364
What are you saying?

32:55.408 --> 32:57.932
Someone who doesn't
play by the rules

32:57.976 --> 33:00.065
delights in outwitting
the system,

33:00.108 --> 33:04.721
manipulates other people
to his own ends.

33:04.765 --> 33:06.767
Who is that person?

33:08.551 --> 33:10.205
You're a con man.

33:10.249 --> 33:13.295
You conned Peters,
but you haven't conned me.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.818
I loathe parlor tricks.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.516
You didn't play by the rules
back then

33:16.559 --> 33:18.735
and you're in hot water
for doing the same thing now.

33:18.779 --> 33:20.302
You're not on the level,

33:20.346 --> 33:21.869
and that exhausts me.

33:21.912 --> 33:23.044
People appreciate a good story

33:23.088 --> 33:24.219
when they're being
sold something.

33:24.263 --> 33:26.395
She said

33:26.439 --> 33:28.136
to the man

33:28.180 --> 33:31.400
wearing completely
clear eyeglasses.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.707
To convince people of what?

33:33.750 --> 33:35.883
To hide from what?

33:35.926 --> 33:37.232
JAKE:
You're not

33:37.276 --> 33:38.668
that different from Dad.
You know that, right?

33:38.712 --> 33:40.453
BULL:
Yeah, we're peas
in a pod.

33:40.496 --> 33:43.847
He was a glorified con man
with a realtor's license.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.719
Do your clients know
you failed the bar twice?

33:45.762 --> 33:48.156
I have three PhDs.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.593
And I never wanted
to be an attorney.

33:50.637 --> 33:54.075
So you're a glorified con man,
but with a psychology degree.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.251
Oh, I get it.

33:56.295 --> 33:57.426
You're saying
I'm a threat to my family

33:57.470 --> 33:59.254
'cause I'm just like my father?

33:59.298 --> 34:01.604
A con man,
a hustler,

34:01.648 --> 34:03.476
a fraud?

34:03.519 --> 34:05.217
Is that what
you're saying, Nate?

34:05.260 --> 34:07.915
I am asking if that's what
you're saying.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.657
Go to hell.

34:10.700 --> 34:11.919
[door slams]

34:23.670 --> 34:24.932
[exhales]

34:28.066 --> 34:31.156
I always liked sitting out here.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.897
Seeing young families
on the street,

34:33.941 --> 34:36.161
parents with little kids.

34:36.204 --> 34:39.294
How could you not
be cheered by that?

34:41.296 --> 34:44.256
Your father left after
he had a success, didn't he?

34:44.299 --> 34:46.954
Yeah. Huge one.

34:46.997 --> 34:49.609
The big score, the one he always
told us was around the corner.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.657
I guess he wanted a new life.

34:56.485 --> 34:58.705
"Money changes everything,"
he used to say.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.837
And he was right.

35:03.057 --> 35:05.059
I lied to you.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.234
Seems only fair.

35:06.278 --> 35:09.150
You weren't my best teacher.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.283
My dad was.

35:11.326 --> 35:14.677
He didn't even have
a high school diploma,

35:14.721 --> 35:18.246
and he could read people
better than any PhD I ever met.

35:18.290 --> 35:21.641
He knew what people
were thinking before they did.

35:21.684 --> 35:25.253
[laughs softly] And he could
get them to believe that

35:25.297 --> 35:28.648
they were doing something
for themselves

35:28.691 --> 35:30.128
when, really,
they were doing it for him.

35:32.391 --> 35:35.133
And I soaked it all up.

35:35.176 --> 35:38.266
He was a thieving narcissist

35:38.310 --> 35:41.269
and a disappointment
to anyone who ever loved him.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.360
And he made me.

35:48.276 --> 35:49.886
His name?

35:49.930 --> 35:51.497
What do you think?

35:51.540 --> 35:53.934
Ah.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.458
Jason Bull, Sr.

35:58.939 --> 36:02.290
There's almost nothing in
the world I know, except this:

36:02.334 --> 36:05.337
children love their parents
even if they don't deserve it.

36:05.380 --> 36:09.384
Sometimes especially
if they don't.

36:09.428 --> 36:12.996
When a father dies,
the child needs to mourn.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.695
But to do that, you can't
hold him at arm's length.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.697
You've got to let him in.

36:18.698 --> 36:20.917
I'm afraid to.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.398
Afraid to admit
how much he's a part of you?

36:25.618 --> 36:28.098
And afraid that...

36:28.142 --> 36:30.013
I'll become just like him.

36:30.057 --> 36:32.146
But you won't,
because you haven't.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.498
Your father wouldn't have

36:36.542 --> 36:39.414
risked his life
to save his daughter.

36:39.458 --> 36:43.113
Wouldn't have confessed
to protect his wife.

36:43.157 --> 36:45.028
He started you, maybe.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.769
You did the rest.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.384
Is that all you got?

36:52.427 --> 36:53.950
[chuckles]

36:53.994 --> 36:56.605
Jason, don't defend.

36:56.649 --> 36:59.086
That's what gets you
into trouble.

36:59.129 --> 37:02.524
Listen. And let this thought in.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.791
Maybe.

37:08.835 --> 37:12.055
Thank you, Nate.

37:12.099 --> 37:14.101
Thank you for the time.

37:14.144 --> 37:16.843
I got nothing but time.

37:19.498 --> 37:20.847
ANDREA:
Uh, hello?

37:20.890 --> 37:22.892
Hello?

37:22.936 --> 37:24.372
Can we help you?

37:25.678 --> 37:26.635
You okay?

37:29.421 --> 37:31.292
Are you all right?
Do you need something?

37:31.336 --> 37:34.774
This is our house.
We live here.Yeah.

37:34.817 --> 37:37.167
[baby cooing]This is your house.

37:37.211 --> 37:39.605
You... Oh.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.084
Sorry.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.999
Uh...
[clears throat]

37:43.043 --> 37:44.479
I just was...

37:45.480 --> 37:47.526
Um...

37:47.569 --> 37:49.223
I knew somebody
who used to live here,

37:49.267 --> 37:51.225
and I was in the
neighborhood, and I...

37:51.269 --> 37:53.662
thought I'd just stop by,
have a look.

37:53.706 --> 37:55.185
You knew the doctor?

37:55.229 --> 37:56.448
Yeah.

37:56.491 --> 37:57.927
We bought the house from him.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.625
Well, uh, from his estate
after he died.

38:00.930 --> 38:04.107
Oh.How'd you know him?

38:04.151 --> 38:06.414
We were friends.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.286
Well, he took great
care of the place.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.723
We had to hardly
do any work on it.

38:10.766 --> 38:12.333
That's good to hear.

38:12.377 --> 38:15.336
It's a great place.

38:15.380 --> 38:18.121
All right, well, I will
get out of your way.

38:18.165 --> 38:20.123
Sorry about that.
Beautiful baby.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.038
Thank you.Oh.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.431
Actually, do either of you

38:23.475 --> 38:26.478
have a cell phone
I could borrow?

38:28.044 --> 38:29.307
He's here.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.923
You're okay.I am totally fine.

38:36.966 --> 38:39.534
I am so glad to see you.Okay.

38:39.578 --> 38:41.754
And I'm gonna slap you so hard
when we get home.

38:41.797 --> 38:44.844
Oh, well, I will accept that
as my just desserts.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.715
Along with a thousand years
of guilt-ridden penitence.

38:46.759 --> 38:49.022
[chuckles] More.Whatever you need.

38:49.065 --> 38:50.632
I told you he was okay.

38:50.676 --> 38:53.853
Chunk was the outlier.
The rest of us were worried.

38:53.896 --> 38:57.683
Ah, well, I am so
sorry about that.

38:57.726 --> 39:00.773
Sorry to make you worry
and also, I'm grateful

39:00.816 --> 39:02.862
to have friends who would worry.

39:02.905 --> 39:04.385
You want to go home?Please.

39:04.429 --> 39:05.343
All right, let me do one thing.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.705
Jake, hey.

39:19.748 --> 39:22.708
How are things coming?

39:22.751 --> 39:24.492
Good. Good.

39:24.536 --> 39:27.408
Well, listen,
I'm-I'm gonna come down.

39:27.452 --> 39:30.368
I'll be there tomorrow.
I'll help with whatever I can.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.503
Yeah, well, I think we should

39:35.547 --> 39:37.462
put the old man to rest
together, you know what I mean?

39:39.638 --> 39:42.989
All right, I'll text you
my flight details.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.599
Love you, too.

40:02.965 --> 40:05.751
By the way, there's something
I want to tell you about.
