00:01.920 --> 00:03.114
Previously on "Quantico"...

00:03.120 --> 00:04.451
You were right
about the terrorist,

00:04.460 --> 00:05.609
even though
I couldn't see it.

00:05.620 --> 00:06.700
What is happening?

00:06.710 --> 00:08.109
Oh, my God.
They're gonna kill her.

00:08.120 --> 00:09.428
Well,
we got to do something!
[ Gunshot ]

00:09.430 --> 00:12.172
You're not_in the clear because
I'm coming after you now.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.499
[ Crying ]
My parents are alive.

00:13.510 --> 00:15.330
I-I know.

00:15.340 --> 00:17.547
I should have told you.
I'm -- I'm so sorry.

00:17.550 --> 00:19.268
Will: If you want
to take down Sistemics,

00:19.270 --> 00:20.396
there are other ways.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.594
Let me help.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.431
It is time
for me to say goodbye...

00:23.440 --> 00:25.010
as your teacher.

00:25.020 --> 00:26.476
The Voice:
We're almost done.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.449
_ All that's left_
IS your final mISS|0n.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.407
And yet here you are.

00:37.410 --> 00:39.708
The fact that I'm even sitting
next to you right now...

00:39.710 --> 00:41.575
[ Sighs ]
Look, I'm already late.

00:41.580 --> 00:43.741
If the Director knew
I was here...

00:43.750 --> 00:47.117
Simon, I need you to
track down an asset for me,

00:47.120 --> 00:49.543
someone very important,
very hidden.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.710
[ Beep ]

00:50.720 --> 00:52.836
She came to me,

00:52.840 --> 00:54.330
spinning out.

00:54.340 --> 00:56.422
Still running down
conspiracy theories

00:56.430 --> 00:59.308
that someone other than Elias
was responSIble for the attacks.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.596
Apparently Hannah Wyland
was helping her,

01:01.600 --> 01:02.726
but that didn't end well.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.472
And who is this "asset"?

01:05.480 --> 01:08.222
Someone the CIA's holding.

01:08.230 --> 01:10.448
It's very hush-hush.

01:10.450 --> 01:12.896
He or she doesn't even
have a name --

01:12.900 --> 01:15.812
just a number.

01:15.820 --> 01:17.856
2281.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.192
2281.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.156
What else
has she told you?

01:22.160 --> 01:24.788
I just came
to hand this off.

01:24.790 --> 01:26.189
I'm out.

01:28.910 --> 01:29.911
See ya, man.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.660
Take care of yourself,
Ryan.

01:35.630 --> 01:38.167
You know Alex.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.343
She never stops.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.341
That's why you have
to stop her.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.261
Nice work.
The tracker's live.

01:46.270 --> 01:47.555
Hopefully he'll move fast.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.642
Simon: Fingers crossed,
but he's got company.

01:49.650 --> 01:51.390
Liam's in town.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.484
Liam: New York City,
Washington D.C., Chicago, L.A.

01:58.490 --> 02:01.618
Only the best of the best
end up there.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.360
Hey

02:03.370 --> 02:05.497
In four short weeks,
your training will end

02:05.500 --> 02:08.617
and you will be assigned to one
of the FBI's 56 field offices.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.622
Think you're a little
outmatched.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.370
You're dreaming if you
think you're gonna take
my spot in New York.

02:15.380 --> 02:17.871
[ Laughs ]
It's all right.

02:17.880 --> 02:21.384
I guess even pros lose their
footing once in a while.

02:21.390 --> 02:25.303
Give up the ghost
and talk about it

02:25.310 --> 02:28.848
Choosing a field office is
about more than picking a job.

02:28.850 --> 02:30.260
It's about finding a home,

02:30.270 --> 02:32.761
a place many of you
will start families.

02:32.770 --> 02:34.317
Samar spoke
to your parents,

02:34.320 --> 02:36.527
and they know that you know
that they're alive,

02:36.530 --> 02:37.758
and they want
to talk to you.

02:37.770 --> 02:39.533
What's the problem?

02:39.540 --> 02:41.770
As a kid, I used to dream
of all the things

02:41.780 --> 02:43.736
that I wish that I could say
to them.

02:43.740 --> 02:46.197
But now that it's a reality,
it's so hard.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.077
If I could
just call them...

02:48.080 --> 02:49.627
I could see if Samar
has their number.

02:49.630 --> 02:51.450
Yeah.

02:51.460 --> 02:54.668
Where you work is also about
what kind of work

02:54.670 --> 02:56.740
you want to do.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.411
Is it narcotics in Miami?

02:58.420 --> 03:00.138
Cyber crime in San Francisco?

03:00.140 --> 03:02.176
Maybe you're drawn
to undercover work.

03:02.180 --> 03:04.557
So, what happens after
they meet "John Baskin"?

03:04.560 --> 03:06.460
You'll transfer the funds,
right?

03:06.470 --> 03:09.132
You'll be brought to an advanced
Sistemics meeting,

03:09.140 --> 03:12.598
and then you will be accelerated
down what they call "the path."

03:12.610 --> 03:14.851
So you're really jumping
into the deep end here, Will.

03:14.860 --> 03:15.849
[ Scoffs ]

03:15.860 --> 03:17.350
You sure _
you want to do this?

03:17.360 --> 03:19.988
And while you do get
to rank your choices,

03:19.990 --> 03:21.776
ultimately the Bureau will do

03:21.780 --> 03:24.271
what it believes is best
for the Bureau.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.236
I wish I had better news,

03:26.240 --> 03:29.744
but things are bad here
for Miranda.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.911
Everything she's touched
is radioactive,

03:31.920 --> 03:34.878
including you two going
undercover as twins.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.324
And you're not in trouble,

03:36.330 --> 03:38.992
but this experiment of hers
may soon be coming to an end.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.968
But this project
is important.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.756
How can the FBI
just give It up?

03:42.760 --> 03:44.967
It was Miranda's idea,
not theirs.

03:44.970 --> 03:47.336
And with Miranda on leave,
pending her hearing,

03:47.340 --> 03:49.137
there's no one left
to push it up the hill.

03:49.140 --> 03:50.846
I'm sorry.

03:50.850 --> 03:53.262
Liam: You have until week's end
to submit your ch0|ces.

03:53.270 --> 03:54.840
And then the praying starts,

03:54.850 --> 03:57.478
because those of you who end up
in towns like Little Rock

03:57.480 --> 03:59.402
never get out.

03:59.410 --> 04:02.447
You sweating from PT or from
Alex giving you the Heisman?

04:02.450 --> 04:04.350
[ Chuckles ]
It ain't like that.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.770
I'm not chasing.

04:05.780 --> 04:08.157
Really? So you're telling me
you're not into her?

04:08.160 --> 04:10.242
Coach used to say no sex
before a big game.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.626
Quantico's one long game.

04:11.630 --> 04:14.326
I haven't let anyone distract me
this entire time.

04:14.330 --> 04:15.991
Why would I start now
when we're so close

04:16.000 --> 04:17.570
to the end of
the fourth quarter?

04:17.580 --> 04:20.799
Because in four weeks we might
be thousands of miles apart.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.586
So if you want a shot,

04:22.590 --> 04:25.753
you better move faster than
your '40 time at the combines.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.216

to "Lady and the Tramp"

with Ryan,

a little...

04:43.280 --> 04:45.817
light, unencumbered...

04:45.820 --> 04:47.151
free.

to focus on than my freedom?

04:52.290 --> 04:54.110
Wow, okay.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.112
You're gonna deflect by bringing
up my resurrected parents?

04:57.120 --> 04:59.202
Caleb said you still haven't
reached out to them.

04:59.210 --> 05:02.008
Don't you at least want
to know why they left?

05:02.010 --> 05:04.217
How do you know that they'd even
tell me the truth?

05:04.220 --> 05:06.711
I mean, it would be one thing if
I could look them in the eye,

05:06.720 --> 05:09.041
but it's not like I can ask them
to risk coming to the US.

05:09.050 --> 05:11.052
to show up
for my graduation.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.345
You could fly to them.

of training?

No.

I don't need to.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.635

05:20.440 --> 05:22.101
We have to prove to the FBI

that they're wrong
about our project.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.810
Even if Miranda
loses her job,

05:25.820 --> 05:29.028
I mean, we're still here
and no one can do what we do.

05:29.030 --> 05:30.782
Can we even do it?

05:30.790 --> 05:32.530
We've had so much trouble.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.859
We've been training.

05:33.870 --> 05:36.441
We can get better.
We already have.

05:36.450 --> 05:38.611
Listen, I'm still committed
to this.

05:38.620 --> 05:39.757
Are you?

05:39.760 --> 05:41.125
More than you know.

05:41.130 --> 05:43.371
But no one
wrll listen to us.

05:43.380 --> 05:45.007
Then we make them.

I'm sure you're all buzzing
at the prospect

05:47.920 --> 05:50.388
of your new field offices,

05:50.390 --> 05:55.054
but can any of you tell me
what this map represents?

05:55.060 --> 05:59.019

Miami, here I come.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.931
Actually, these are
the US. cities

06:00.940 --> 06:03.397
with the highest rates
of human trafﬁcking.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.187
Human trafficking is the largest
and fastest growing

06:06.190 --> 06:08.146
criminal enterprise
in the world.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.902
So while you'll soon
freely travel

to these cities
as newly minted agents,

06:11.910 --> 06:13.980
thousands of men and women
will be trafficked

06:15.410 --> 06:17.480
As you sweat
your future locations,

06:17.490 --> 06:20.379
I find a little perspective
can be helpful,

which is why this week you will
learn the ins and outs

06:23.460 --> 06:25.917
of how people are smuggled
across borders.

with immigration,

06:33.600 --> 06:36.000
while learning firsthand how
these crimes are perpetrated.

06:45.730 --> 06:47.277
One final announcement.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.724
As you all know,

06:48.730 --> 06:50.368
I've been taking on the
assistant director's workload

06:50.370 --> 06:52.406
in her absence,
which means I've been in need

06:52.410 --> 06:53.616
of another staff counselor

06:53.620 --> 06:55.485
to help me in your ﬁnal weeks
of training.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.902

for a transfer back to LA.

Yeah, well, working around Alex
hasn't been exactly easy.

07:30.570 --> 07:31.901
First it was our history,

07:31.910 --> 07:34.060
but recently there's been
a whole lot more.

07:34.070 --> 07:36.652
Well, if you ask me, they never
should have reinstated her.

07:36.660 --> 07:39.060
But PR said it would be
a nightmare if they didn't.

07:39.070 --> 07:41.379
Yeah, well, Alex believes
she knows more than the Bureau.

that Elias didn't act alone.

07:44.460 --> 07:47.338
And now she's dragging other
people into her little crusade.

07:47.340 --> 07:48.489
Pretty sure the only reason

07:48.500 --> 07:50.172
Hannah got suspended
was because of Alex.

07:50.180 --> 07:55.880
[ Sighs ] I know I should let
it go, but I can't.

another embarrassment

07:57.510 --> 07:58.465
for the New York office...

07:58.470 --> 08:01.644
[sighs]
I need your help.

08:01.650 --> 08:02.935
What can I do?

08:02.940 --> 08:04.259
Alex is after a CIA asset.

08:04.270 --> 08:06.431
What I want to do is
I want to head her off

08:06.440 --> 08:08.180
and find out why
she's after them

08:08.190 --> 08:10.272
before she hurts the Bureau
or herself.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.273
I have an old friend
at the Company

08:14.280 --> 08:16.362
that could arrange
an off-the-books meeting,

08:16.370 --> 08:18.486
but it's no small favor.

08:18.490 --> 08:21.414
Well, it's the least
you can do for the new
head of the branch.

08:21.420 --> 08:22.739
Hm.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.206
Alex: It's happening.

08:25.210 --> 08:26.950
Simon:
Once the meeting is set,

08:26.960 --> 08:29.281
the CIA will move their asset
to a safe house.

08:29.290 --> 08:31.713
That gives us a small window
to extract whoever it is

08:31.720 --> 08:34.507
and de_liver_them to the
terrorist just like they asked.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.717
This is the only way to pull off
what we have to pull off.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.005
You're right.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.807
But_this is_ also
our final mi55ion,

08:39.810 --> 08:42.768
our last chance to figure out
what the terrorist is planning,

08:42.770 --> 08:44.135
and all we have to go on
is a break-in

08:44.140 --> 08:46.438
at some C_olumbia
UniverSIty lab.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.180

was stolen.

The question is
what did Columbia have

08:50.110 --> 08:52.237
that they don't want us
to know they had?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.105
Which is why this asset
is the key.

08:54.110 --> 08:56.021
If we can extract them,
we can question them

08:56.030 --> 08:57.600
before we deliver them
to the Voice

08:57.610 --> 08:59.919
and figure out what the Voice
is planning once and for all.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.569
We'd better,
because if we don't,

09:01.580 --> 09:04.208
we just helped a terrorist put
the final piece in place

09:04.210 --> 09:05.859
of whatever it is
they're planning.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.661
Two CIA operatives are escorting
the asset

09:14.670 --> 09:16.718
to a safe house
as we speak.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.005
You'll need a partner.

09:18.010 --> 09:21.138
Nimah Amin.
I trust her.

09:21.140 --> 09:23.517
You'll have 10 minutes
with the asset,

09:23.520 --> 09:24.976
_ so ask _
the right questions.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.516
I will.
Where am I going?

09:26.520 --> 09:29.899
74 Ridge Road, Buchanan,
New York.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.733
Secluded.
It's remote.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.389
Will the plan work there?

09:34.400 --> 09:35.947
We're gonna find out.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.178
[ Beep ]

09:39.150 --> 09:41.823
Liam:
Smuggling a person isn't easy.

09:41.830 --> 09:43.695
Many are lured through
legal loopholes

09:43.700 --> 09:44.997
on sites like Craigslist.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.365
Promised help in acquiring Visas

09:46.370 --> 09:49.578
in exchange for service
or labor work,

09:49.580 --> 09:51.298
then sold
to the highest bidder.

09:51.300 --> 09:55.373
So, comb through the intel,
find the coded language,

09:55.380 --> 09:58.122
and see how the FBI
caught these traffickers.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.519
This must be weird
for you.

10:00.520 --> 10:04.889
Yeah, I told myself every time
I look up, he'd be gone.

10:04.890 --> 10:09.099
Sometimes stopping a terrorist
means firing your gun.

10:09.100 --> 10:12.433
Other times is as simple as
spotting a fake watermark.

10:12.440 --> 10:16.319
Every year, forgers get more
and more sophisticated.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.311
The differences are often
invisible to the naked eye.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.369
Fake control numbers,
embossed security images...

10:21.370 --> 10:25.158
and missing watermarks that can
only be seen under UV lights.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.946
Many of these are fakes.

10:26.950 --> 10:28.827
Can you spot the real ones?

10:28.830 --> 10:32.049
Kami-Kamikaze

10:32.050 --> 10:34.587
Hey, Olsen. You've been on that
for 15 minutes.

10:34.590 --> 10:35.875
What gives?

10:35.880 --> 10:39.372
I'm almost done.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.712
Caleb:
Maybe this trip to the border
could be just what you need.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.177
We're going to meet your parents
without the US. knowing.

10:44.180 --> 10:45.590
I'll think about it, okay?

10:45.600 --> 10:47.090
I can reach out
if you want.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.840
Can we just focus
on the exercise?

10:50.440 --> 10:52.852
Hey, tell me this isn't another
undercover mission,

10:52.860 --> 10:55.727
because I can't have my heart
broken again.

10:55.730 --> 10:57.561
It's good to see
you, too, Hoss.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.640
I wonder if Alex
feels the same.

10:59.650 --> 11:01.618
You should fly away with me

11:01.620 --> 11:04.077
We got one, two,
three till the...

11:04.080 --> 11:06.401
But most people are still
smuggled into the US.

11:06.410 --> 11:09.447
the old-fashioned way --
across physical borders.

11:09.450 --> 11:13.284
Examine this vehicle and see
exactly how for yourself.

11:13.290 --> 11:14.837
Report your findings.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.491
Take me to the party

11:17.500 --> 11:20.503
Kami-Kamikaze

11:20.510 --> 11:23.502
Blame it on the bus

11:23.510 --> 11:26.673
I am never gonna get enough

11:26.680 --> 11:29.592
Take me to the party

11:29.600 --> 11:32.603
Kami-Kamikaze

11:32.610 --> 11:36.068
Not a bad place for twins to
swap in and out of an operation.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.140
If we can keep it going.

11:38.150 --> 11:39.731
Liam is the AD. now.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.652
Maybe we should ask him if
he wants Miranda's leftovers.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.982
Oh, hey.
I almost forgot you were here.

11:46.990 --> 11:49.823
Drew Perales.
Heard a ton about you.

11:49.830 --> 11:53.322
Special Agent Ryan Booth.
Head nothing about you.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.454
You got a minute?

11:55.460 --> 11:57.371
Yeah.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.200
I'll be right back.

12:01.010 --> 12:03.501
Liam needed someone to fill in
who knew the class,

12:03.510 --> 12:05.887
and I felt like I owed it to him
and Miranda to accept.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.710
I get it.
It's your job.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.335
You can't say no to where
you've been assigned.

12:09.340 --> 12:10.762
Right.

12:10.770 --> 12:11.839
I was gonna reach out,

12:11.850 --> 12:13.431
but after the last time
we spoke,

12:13.440 --> 12:15.146
it didn't seem like
you were...

12:15.150 --> 12:17.186
You don't have to explain
anything to me, okay?

12:17.190 --> 12:18.839
You're here in _
a professmnal capaCIty,

12:18.850 --> 12:20.112
and you're being
professional.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.690
And so am I.
I'm a NAT,

12:21.700 --> 12:22.610
and you're
a staff counselor.

12:22.620 --> 12:24.315
Yes.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.311
Very clear lines that no one
in the history of Quantico

12:26.320 --> 12:27.810
would ever dream
about crossmg.

12:27.820 --> 12:32.166
So [sighs] it's nice to meet
you, Trainee Parrish.

12:32.170 --> 12:33.740
You too, Agent Booth.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.706
S-Special Agent.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.365
Good luck.

12:38.370 --> 12:40.179
Liam: I know this is hard
to accept,

12:40.180 --> 12:42.922
but the twins experiment
is over.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.545
Now you can both
head to the border.

12:44.550 --> 12:46.427
There's no reason to hide you
being twins

12:46.430 --> 12:47.636
from the outside world anymore.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.335
With all due respect,

12:49.340 --> 12:51.979
we'll wait until we hear back
from the Bureau

12:51.980 --> 12:53.641
that it's
officially terminated.

12:53.650 --> 12:55.595
Until then,
we'll maintain our cover.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.307
Raina will head to the border
alone, and I'll stay here.

12:58.310 --> 13:01.484
Miranda liked
your stubborn streak.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.606
So do I.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.771
I'll respect your wishes,
but don't get your hopes up.

13:05.780 --> 13:09.022
The Bureau is unlikely to change
its mind, and so am I.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.247
All right, fine. Iwas just
getting you off my back.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.320
I don't want
to meet my parents.

13:15.330 --> 13:16.900
Okay, Samar says that they want
to meet you.

13:16.910 --> 13:18.241
Who cares?

13:18.250 --> 13:20.798
They're just as much con artists
as she is.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.791
Yeah, I-I get that,
but Samar

13:22.800 --> 13:25.678
has been above board ever since
you found out.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.171
I mean, she came here,
she returned your money,

13:28.180 --> 13:30.307
she's even divorcing
the jackass husband

13:30.310 --> 13:32.187
that conned you out of that
extra $5 mil.

13:32.190 --> 13:35.921
And if you ask me,
I believe her

13:35.930 --> 13:38.387
when she says that your parents
want to meet with you

13:38.390 --> 13:40.358
and just explain why they did
what they've done.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.850
What do you think
they're gonna say?

13:41.860 --> 13:43.270
I mean, everybody assumes

13:43.280 --> 13:45.521
that parents love their kids
unconditionally,

13:45.530 --> 13:47.896
but we've run case studies
on things like that.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.902
We know that isn't
always true.

13:49.910 --> 13:52.993
And honestly,
I'm not ready to find out.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.945
I know you
don't feel ready,

13:54.950 --> 13:57.248
but you're never going
to feel ready.

if they disappear again

13:58.910 --> 14:00.662

that you need?

never stop wondering.

When I lost my father,

there was so much

from life at Quantico.

14:37.580 --> 14:40.253
Your stay in Canada's gonna go
differently than advertised.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.797
Instead of working alongside
TSA and customs,

14:42.800 --> 14:44.620
you will be working
against them

14:44.630 --> 14:46.871

cross the border

14:46.880 --> 14:49.257

deliberately break the law?

You have until 9:00 am.
tomorrow morning

14:58.680 --> 15:00.728
to get back
across that border.

15:00.730 --> 15:04.769

field office of their choice.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.681
Special consideration
will be given to any team

at all.

Why'd they split us up?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.991
Maybe it was a mistake.

I don't think
it was a mistake.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.796

to graduation?

15:34.260 --> 15:36.000

20:22.640 --> 20:25.382
It was September 11, 2001,

when we were sitting
on the tarmac at Logan

20:28.010 --> 20:30.308
when the Untied flight
ahead of us

flew right into
the second tower.

was responsible.

In the late '905, McGregor-Wyatt
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.522
But an associate of ours
had an intermediary

20:46.530 --> 20:48.270
to the Afghani government.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.363
We, um, sold them
weapons systems software.

20:54.960 --> 20:59.124
It was just off-the-books money
that allowed us to survive.

20:59.130 --> 21:00.961
Then a year later
we found out

21:00.970 --> 21:04.758
that our intermediary
had conspired all along

21:04.760 --> 21:07.832
to place our product
in the hands of the Taliban.

21:07.840 --> 21:11.389
So, we sat there on the runway
knowing a war was coming.

21:11.390 --> 21:13.642
It was just awful knowing
that what we sold

21:13.650 --> 21:15.800
would be used against
our own troops,

21:15.810 --> 21:17.186
and knowing that
the US. government

21:17.190 --> 21:19.476
would hold us accountable
for arming an enemy,

21:19.480 --> 21:21.562
whether intentionally
or not.

21:21.570 --> 21:24.061
If they came after us, we would
have lost everything --

you, the company,
our freedom.

21:25.950 --> 21:28.271
We had to make a decision fast,
and we did.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.986
We changed
the flight manifest.

21:31.580 --> 21:33.207
We still do.

Yeah, we made it look like
we died on 175.

We got on a private jet
the next day

39:01.290 --> 39:03.167
I should probably get going,
Staff Counselor.

39:03.170 --> 39:05.377
Yeah, Parrish,
you probably should.

39:05.380 --> 39:08.952
And I get the feeling
that we've shuffled on

39:08.960 --> 39:11.337
To the 18 of you who made it
across the border last night,

39:11.340 --> 39:13.729
your success is not a victory.

39:13.730 --> 39:15.766
If you can sneak across
so easily,

39:15.770 --> 39:17.465
then so can the very traffickers

39:17.470 --> 39:19.927
you will be working against
in the field.

39:19.930 --> 39:23.559
That being said,
I was impressed,

39:23.570 --> 39:25.640
especially with our winners,

39:25.650 --> 39:28.278
who displayed great
determination.

39:28.280 --> 39:31.738
Congratulations to Raina
and Nimah.

39:34.910 --> 39:37.037
They won not just because
of hard work,

39:37.040 --> 39:38.484
but because of resourcefulness,

39:38.490 --> 39:39.980
which will be one of

39:39.990 --> 39:42.299
your most indispensable assets
in the field,

39:42.300 --> 39:44.291
because this job will force you

39:44.300 --> 39:47.372
to confront many
difficult questions.

39:47.380 --> 39:49.541
Ask yourself, what risks
will you take

39:49.550 --> 39:51.120
when everything is on the line?

39:51.130 --> 39:52.961
Caleb: The money for Sistemics
is gone,

39:52.970 --> 39:54.551
so we have to _find
another way in.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.175
Well, they already scheduled
my intake meeting.

39:56.180 --> 39:56.999
I'll use my own money.

39:57.010 --> 39:58.261
No, they'll trace it
back to you.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.305
No, they won't.

39:59.310 --> 40:01.050
I'll put it in
a safety deposit box

40:01.060 --> 40:02.937
at the same bank
you were usmg.

40:02.940 --> 40:04.817
You really want to help,
don't you?

40:04.820 --> 40:07.141
How will you convince some that
you know the right way forward

40:07.150 --> 40:09.186
when they think they know best?

40:09.190 --> 40:10.600
I spoke with the Bureau.

40:10.610 --> 40:12.157
It seems like your project

40:12.160 --> 40:14.321
might have some life in it
after all.

40:14.330 --> 40:18.073
I hope you understand that this
means working harder than ever.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.150
It means moving
back in together,

40:20.160 --> 40:21.991
being committed to matching
perfectly.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.376
The end is near.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.792
Now is the time
to get it right.

40:25.800 --> 40:29.292
Out in the field,
there is no room for mistakes.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.200
Liam: Can you allow yourself
to tell the truth

40:31.210 --> 40:33.713
even if you know
the consequences?

40:33.720 --> 40:35.256
So, I'm thinking St. Kitts

40:35.260 --> 40:36.966
for the next meet-up
with my parents.

40:36.970 --> 40:38.255
What do you think?

40:38.260 --> 40:40.137
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, St. Kitts.

40:40.140 --> 40:42.267
That --
That sounds great.

40:42.270 --> 40:44.727
Because I promise you

40:44.730 --> 40:47.267
there will be questions
without easy answers

40:47.270 --> 40:49.056
and moments _
you never see coming.

41:01.630 --> 41:05.202
Wait!
Are you sure about this?

41:05.210 --> 41:08.623
[ Breathes heavily]
It's the only way.

41:08.630 --> 41:09.528
I promise.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.798
[ Cellphone rings ]
Wait.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.347
You said this was
the last thing.

41:20.350 --> 41:22.727
The Voice:
It is the last thing for you.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.470
Not for him.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.687
Send Simon with Will.

41:26.690 --> 41:28.089
No.

41:28.100 --> 41:30.352
No, that was not part
of the deal.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.601
No. No, Simon.
No.

41:32.610 --> 41:33.861
I got no choice.

41:33.870 --> 41:35.314
That's what everyone else
said, too.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.151
I can't lose you.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.981
You got to let me go.

41:42.710 --> 41:44.701
It's okay.

41:44.710 --> 41:47.417
I'll be all right.

41:47.420 --> 41:49.706
I've come back from the dead
before, right?

41:55.300 --> 41:58.383
Thank you, Alex.
You've been very helpful.

41:58.390 --> 41:59.789
[ Sobs ]

41:59.800 --> 42:01.848
You won't hear from me again.

42:01.850 --> 42:04.728
Now hand your phone
to the driver of the car.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.630
[ Car door closes ]
And take care.
