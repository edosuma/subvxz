00:33.659 --> 00:35.561
Whip crack away, whip crack away

00:35.661 --> 00:38.264
Whip crack away

00:50.676 --> 00:55.156
Whip crack away, whip crack away
Whip crack away

01:23.500 --> 01:25.444
The Deadwood stage!

01:25.544 --> 01:27.529
The Deadwood stage!

01:27.629 --> 01:30.027
The Deadwood stage!

01:30.507 --> 01:34.620
Oh, the Deadwood stage
Is a-rollin' on over the plains

01:34.720 --> 01:39.041
With the curtains flappin'
And the driver slappin' the reins

01:39.141 --> 01:41.126
A beautiful sky

01:41.226 --> 01:43.378
A wonderful day

01:43.478 --> 01:47.382
Whip crack away, whip crack away
Whip crack away

01:47.482 --> 01:51.553
Oh, the Deadwood stage
Is a-headin' on over the hills

01:51.653 --> 01:56.183
Where the Injun arrows
Are thicker than porcupine quills

01:56.283 --> 01:58.018
Dangerous land

01:58.118 --> 01:59.895
No time to delay

01:59.995 --> 02:03.815
So whip crack away, whip crack away
Whip crack away

02:03.915 --> 02:08.946
We're headin' straight for town
Loaded down with a fancy cargo

02:09.045 --> 02:12.741
Care of Wells and Fargo, Illinois
Boy

02:13.091 --> 02:17.120
Oh, the Deadwood stage
Is a-comin' on over the crest

02:17.220 --> 02:21.750
Like a homing pigeon
That's a-hankerin' after its nest

02:21.850 --> 02:23.627
Twenty-three miles

02:23.727 --> 02:25.379
We've covered today

02:25.479 --> 02:29.383
So whip crack away, whip crack away
Whip crack away

02:29.483 --> 02:34.471
The wheels go turnin' round, homeward bound
Can't you hear them humming

02:34.571 --> 02:38.392
Happy times are coming for to stay Hey

02:38.492 --> 02:42.062
We'll be home tonight
By the light of the silvery moon

02:42.788 --> 02:46.017
And my heads a-thumpin'
Like a mandolin a-plunking a tune

02:47.167 --> 02:49.069
When I get home

02:49.169 --> 02:50.988
I'm fixing to stay

02:51.088 --> 02:55.742
So whip crack away, whip crack-away
Whip crack-away

02:55.842 --> 02:58.695
Whip crack away, whip crack away
Whip crack away

03:16.905 --> 03:18.932
Here they be, here they be

03:19.032 --> 03:20.809
How's about a welcome?

03:20.909 --> 03:24.730
A peaceful sort of welcome for the gang

03:24.830 --> 03:29.192
Oh, the Deadwood stage
Is finally home again

03:29.292 --> 03:33.614
Well excuse my stammer
If it ain't Calamity Jane

03:33.714 --> 03:35.324
Hi, Calam

03:35.424 --> 03:38.201
- What'd you bring us today?
- New rubber boots?

03:38.301 --> 03:40.119
- Ten-dollar suits?
- Things to crochet?

03:41.513 --> 03:45.042
Beads that sparkle like a prism
Snake oil for your rheumatism

03:45.142 --> 03:48.670
Calico and gingham for the girls

03:48.770 --> 03:52.174
Gumdrops made in Chicago
Gumdrops just a trifle soggy

03:52.274 --> 03:55.927
And a genuine string
of artificial pearls

03:56.027 --> 03:57.763
Here's a hat from Cincinnati

03:57.863 --> 04:01.888
Same as Adelina Patti
Wore in every famous concert hall

04:03.285 --> 04:06.938
Cast your eye on Dr. Boer's
Patent-pending hair restorer

04:07.038 --> 04:09.561
Guaranteed to grow hair
on a billiard ball

04:23.555 --> 04:26.625
Introducin' Henry Miller

04:26.933 --> 04:30.212
Just as busy as a fizzy sarsaparilla

04:30.312 --> 04:33.674
Ain't a showman and he's smarter
Operates the Golden Garter

04:33.774 --> 04:37.094
Where the cream of Deadwood City
Come to dine

04:37.194 --> 04:41.424
And I'm glad to say
He's a very good friend of mine

04:42.657 --> 04:46.061
Hi, Joe
Say, where'd you get them fancy clothes?

04:46.161 --> 04:49.481
I know
Off some fellow's laundry line

04:49.581 --> 04:52.734
Hi, Beau
Aren't you the Prairie Rose

04:52.834 --> 04:56.655
Smelling like a watermelon vine

04:57.714 --> 05:01.034
Here's a man the sheriff watches

05:01.134 --> 05:04.496
On his gun
There's more then 27 notches

05:04.596 --> 05:07.833
On the draw there's no one faster
And you're flirting with disaster

05:07.933 --> 05:11.913
When Bill Hickok's reputation you malign

05:13.021 --> 05:20.130
And I'm glad to say he's a very good friend,
Of a friend of mine

05:20.821 --> 05:25.142
Oh, my throat's as dry
As a desert thistle in May

05:25.242 --> 05:29.479
In the Golden Garter
Gonna wet my whistle today

05:29.579 --> 05:33.859
Last to the bar's a three-legged crow

05:33.959 --> 05:37.779
Set them up, Joe, set them up, Joe
Set them up, Joe

05:37.879 --> 05:39.865
Drinks on the house, drinks on the house

05:39.965 --> 05:45.328
Set them up, Joe

05:56.147 --> 05:57.920
Make mine sarsaparilla.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.057
It ain't so funny.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.436
Any excitement on this trip, Calam?

06:09.536 --> 06:10.812
Excitement.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.149
Why, I got more arrows in the back of
that coach than a porcupine's got stickers.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.320
Seemed like the whole Sioux nation.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.656
- Hey, where is that sarsaparilla?
- Here you are, Calam.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.950
I'd like a little beer.

06:38.565 --> 06:42.044
No, please. Don't. Don't!

06:45.030 --> 06:46.223
Is there a woman in here?

06:46.323 --> 06:50.178
No, sir. Just Indians.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.141
Where is my actress?

06:59.586 --> 07:04.825
Without warning, down they come out
of them hills howling like souls in torment.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.198
Why, must have been 100 of them.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.958
It weren't no laughing matter.

07:13.058 --> 07:16.378
Sure, it wasn't. I'd hate to have
a war party that big on my tail.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.547
You know, Bill,
except for me, of course...

07:18.647 --> 07:21.925
you're the only galoot in the world
could've brought that coach in.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.134
Thanks, Calam.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.679
Of course, it called
for some mighty rapid shooting.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.682
My gun got so hot, I had to sit
with my legs stretched out...

07:28.782 --> 07:32.394
holding the muzzle of my gun
between my feet to keep it from curling up.

07:32.494 --> 07:36.857
Yeah, I must have killed about 30 of them
painted varmints before they got discouraged.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.200
I've got to see to the horses.

07:56.726 --> 08:00.046
How many of them injuns
you reckon I shot, Rattlesnake?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.215
About 30, I reckon, Calam.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.886
That's better. Next time I tell a story,
keep your hands in your pockets...

08:05.986 --> 08:07.884
you toothless old buffalo.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.224
Come and get them.

08:11.616 --> 08:15.145
Who wants cigarettes? Just came in
on the stage. A dollar a pack.

08:18.707 --> 08:23.984
Look at them, snapping for them
cigarettes like a bunch of silk-gloved dudes.

08:25.046 --> 08:28.275
- Another dying Robert E. Lee.
- I got General Grant.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.660
- Queen Victoria.
- Carnsarn boat again.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.538
- Yippee! I got her. I got her.
- Let's see it.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.164
I'll give you $5 for it.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.335
I wouldn't take 50,
because I'm keeping her close to my heart.

08:41.270 --> 08:46.218
- What you suppose is getting into them?
- It's Adelaid, Calam. Adelaid.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.887
What's an Adelaid?

08:48.987 --> 08:51.598
She's a hope. A dream. A vision.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.225
You see her carved on the prow
of an ancient ship...

08:54.325 --> 08:56.394
in the dying embers of the camp fire.

08:56.494 --> 09:02.734
Circe, Aphrodite, Helen of Troy.
In this case, it's Adelaid Adams.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.938
You mean,
all that in a pack of cigarettes?

09:10.175 --> 09:11.572
Beautiful, ain't she?

09:12.886 --> 09:15.330
She ain't got nothing
on but her underwear.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.499
Them's tights, Calam.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.669
She's a great actress, so they tell me.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.794
She's charming, lovely figure,
everything that a woman ought to be.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.595
Looks like a fat, frilled-up side
of undressed beef to me.

09:30.695 --> 09:35.392
I could look the same.
Except I got certain ideas about modesty.

09:35.492 --> 09:39.562
Ain't one man wouldn't ride 100 miles
just for one glimpse of Miss Adams.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.524
You, maybe.
Some of that scum around here.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.193
But a gentleman wouldn't look twice
at such a picture.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.655
Yeah. A gentleman like
Lieutenant Gilmartin for instance?

09:48.755 --> 09:52.325
Yeah, now that you mention it.
Like Lieutenant Gilmartin.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.411
You're kind of stuck on him, ain't you?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.993
Ain't saying until he does.

09:58.515 --> 10:02.585
Say, where's he been, anyway? I kind of
thought maybe he'd be here to meet the stage.

10:02.685 --> 10:07.007
Oh, he's on duty at the Fort, I guess.
Last time I saw him was a week ago.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.460
He came in to buy a pack
of them cigarettes.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.391
Mr. Miller, please.
Nobody pays any attention to me.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.600
Why should they?

10:17.700 --> 10:23.648
Well, Mr. Miller, you're expecting me.
I'm Francis Fryer.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.066
Where is my actress?

10:25.166 --> 10:28.820
The one who wrote me the letter
about my ad in the Chicago newspaper?

10:28.920 --> 10:32.782
I hired her.
She's supposed to be here. Look.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.450
I'm advertising her.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.367
Oh. Well, that's me.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.664
You're her?

10:40.765 --> 10:44.544
No, I'm not her. You see, I'm...

10:44.644 --> 10:47.247
Look. "Francis Fryer."

10:48.398 --> 10:53.049
You're Francis Fryer?
You deceived me. You're fired.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.431
No, you're not fired.
I've got to have somebody.

10:56.531 --> 10:57.640
I'm ruined.

10:57.740 --> 11:02.020
I advertised an actress. When that crowd
sees you tonight, they'll lynch me.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.268
Go hide in my office.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.572
Tell us all about it.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.616
What happened? Who got you?

11:14.716 --> 11:16.910
Indians. War party.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.580
There were five of us: Two surveyors
and a lieutenant from the Fort.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.458
They jumped us at Eagle Pass.

11:23.558 --> 11:27.208
They killed the surveyors
and the lieutenant.

11:27.353 --> 11:31.253
- What lieutenant?
- Gilmallin, his name was.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.095
- They got Danny Gilmartin?
- They got him, all right. The others too.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.797
The rotten savages!

11:39.032 --> 11:42.306
How did they get him? Quick?
Clean? In the heart?

11:42.410 --> 11:45.105
- I reckon. Or in the head.
- Maybe both.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.314
Don't you know?

11:46.414 --> 11:49.109
They got him plenty.
They got him quick and fast.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.569
His horse went down.
He died right where he fell.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.655
Didn't you go back
and find out for sure?

11:53.755 --> 11:56.449
Go back? How in blazes could we go back?

11:56.549 --> 11:59.152
They chased us for 10 miles,
showering us with arrows.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.288
You left him, didn't you?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.033
You never went back to see
if he was dead or alive.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.169
You slab-sided, white-bellied coyotes.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.464
You left Danny
like I wouldn't leave a hurt dog!

12:11.564 --> 12:15.009
- Calam, where are you going?
- To get Danny.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.260
Let's go!

13:16.379 --> 13:18.902
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Just untie me.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.751
Get on that horse.

13:39.736 --> 13:43.848
Why do we have to ride the same horse?
We could've grabbed an Indian pony.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.301
It's cozier this way.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.561
What happened then, Calam?

13:55.752 --> 13:58.488
I give him a bullet
right between the eyeballs.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.567
Then me and Danny lit out,
two more of them coming after us.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.535
I shot them both. Didn't I, Danny?

14:04.635 --> 14:08.331
- Why... Well... Ahem.
- You killed four of them?

14:08.431 --> 14:11.284
- That's all there were.
- You're the girl to do it too.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.263
What's the matter with you?
Don't you believe me?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.014
Oh, sure.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.684
Only, with you killing off
them redskins so fast...

14:27.784 --> 14:31.184
I was wondering why the government
even bothered to send the army.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.483
Are you calling me a liar again?

14:39.587 --> 14:41.735
Why don't you ever fix your hair?

14:42.882 --> 14:45.201
Adelaid Adams! I got her! Look!

14:49.389 --> 14:51.332
I didn't save you for no other female.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.012
Gentlemen and... gentlemen.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.394
In keeping with the policy
of the Golden Garter...

15:11.494 --> 15:15.440
which strives to bring to Deadwood
the best in entertainment...

15:15.540 --> 15:17.567
regardless of the expense...

15:17.667 --> 15:21.112
it is my great pleasure
to present to you now...

15:21.212 --> 15:26.409
that lovely star, that toast of New York,
Miss Frances Fryer.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.337
I can't.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.467
I can't.

15:50.908 --> 15:55.229
- Come on. Get out there.
- If I go on as a woman, they'll murder me.

15:55.329 --> 15:59.024
If you don't, they'll murder you.
And me too. Now, get out there.

16:15.850 --> 16:19.204
- Do you see what I see?
- She ain't very good-looking.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.168
That ain't all she ain't.

16:22.273 --> 16:25.301
I've got two wonderful arms

16:25.401 --> 16:27.970
I've got two wonderful lips

16:28.070 --> 16:32.350
I'm over 21 and I'm free

16:32.450 --> 16:36.938
Oh, I've got a hive full of honey

16:37.038 --> 16:40.441
For the right kind of honey bee

16:40.541 --> 16:41.688
Psst.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.074
I'm not the glamorous type

16:48.174 --> 16:50.535
But I'm the amorous type

16:50.635 --> 16:54.410
You'll love the way I fit on your knee

16:56.265 --> 17:00.253
Oh, I've got a hive full of honey

17:00.353 --> 17:04.458
For the right kind of honey bee

17:07.568 --> 17:11.138
My daddy owns a rail road

17:11.239 --> 17:15.768
And my ma is a millionaire

17:15.867 --> 17:19.439
And besides, I'm an only child

17:19.539 --> 17:24.019
Do you think you could learn to care?

17:26.837 --> 17:29.449
If you're the one I adore

17:29.549 --> 17:31.868
Come on and get it before

17:31.968 --> 17:36.323
Somebody shakes it down from the tree.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.547
I've got a hive full of honey

17:44.647 --> 17:47.796
For the right kind of honey bee

17:48.234 --> 17:51.929
I got two wonderful arms
I got two wonderful lips

17:52.029 --> 17:55.383
I'm over 21 and I'm free

17:55.825 --> 17:59.562
Oh, I've got a hive full of honey

17:59.662 --> 18:03.517
For the right kind of honey bee

18:21.350 --> 18:23.211
Miller is in for it now.

18:23.311 --> 18:28.299
Please, everybody, I can explain.
I may have made a mistake about his gender...

18:28.399 --> 18:31.677
but not his talent. He's a great actor.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.256
He's wonderful. If you'd give us a chance.
I'll make it up to you.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.725
You'll have a good time.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.986
Gosh, Bill, they're all walking out of here.
This will ruin Millie.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.859
- Do something.
- Do what?

18:58.596 --> 18:59.993
Listen to me!

19:02.016 --> 19:04.502
Listen to me, you mangy groundhogs.

19:04.602 --> 19:09.131
This ain't no way to treat Millie.
You wouldn't have a theater without him.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.342
Can't a man make a mistake in this town?

19:11.442 --> 19:15.638
We ain't suckers. He promised us
a New York actress. Look what we got!

19:15.738 --> 19:17.260
Yeah!

19:19.283 --> 19:23.896
- You got what he got!
- We don't want it. No, we don't want it!

19:23.996 --> 19:25.189
Wait a minute!

19:25.289 --> 19:29.068
He knows how disappointed you are.
Give him a chance and he'll make it up.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.779
- Won't you, Millie?
- Sure. Anything.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.323
He fooled us once,
and he'll fool us again.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.443
Millie won't do nothing for us.

19:38.928 --> 19:43.374
He will. He'll get you an actress prettier
than the one you expected.

19:43.474 --> 19:47.124
- Why, he's written for her already.
- What actress? Who's he going to get?

19:48.771 --> 19:51.257
A big one. A plumb big one.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.009
Who, Calam? Tell us who.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.347
We'd like to know who she is.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.433
Adelaid Adams, that's who!

20:03.536 --> 20:07.106
It sounds too good to be true,
but it better be.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.191
You've got Calamity Jane's word on it.

20:09.291 --> 20:13.612
Get back to your tables, you coyotes.
Enjoy the show!

20:16.382 --> 20:17.783
I'll make this all up to you.

20:17.883 --> 20:23.456
Mr. Miller, Adelaid Adams is in Chicago.
She wouldn't be caught dead in this town.

20:23.889 --> 20:27.334
I think I'll take a long walk
off a short precipice.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.590
Look, I figure...

20:41.323 --> 20:44.977
My death warrant, she signed.
Adelaid Adams.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.230
If you'd only promised them
any other actress.

20:48.330 --> 20:53.061
- I don't know no other actress.
- That's why they call her "Calamity."

20:53.711 --> 20:55.571
Listen, you two-bit gambler...

20:55.671 --> 20:59.696
I didn't see you come up with an idea
when the chips were down.

21:01.343 --> 21:05.748
At least you've still got a theater.
What stops you getting this Adelaid?

21:05.848 --> 21:09.794
This joint's the biggest goldmine
in Deadwood. You can afford it.

21:09.894 --> 21:13.589
- Why don't you send for her?
- Why don't I send for the Queen of Sheba?

21:13.689 --> 21:15.007
Yeah.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.586
No good. They want Adelaid.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.098
Look, nothing is impossible
for Calamity.

21:22.198 --> 21:25.472
Didn't she save the stage
from 100 savage injuns?

21:25.576 --> 21:29.980
Didn't she rescue her pretty lieutenant
from a fate worse than death?

21:30.080 --> 21:34.356
Besides, she gave the boys her word
that Adelaid would be here.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.566
Calamity's word is sacred.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.695
Bill.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.874
- You really have that much faith in me?
- Who knows you better than me?

21:48.974 --> 21:52.628
You think I could go to Chicago
and bring Adelaid Adams back here?

21:52.728 --> 21:55.172
You gave your word, and I trust that.

21:55.272 --> 21:59.427
About as much as I do a blind rattlesnake
with a brand new button on his tail.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.180
Hey, wait a minute.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.393
- Aw, you no good four-flushing...
- You talk too much.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.854
In the summer you're the winter

22:09.954 --> 22:12.440
In the finger you're the splinter

22:12.540 --> 22:14.608
In the banquet you're the stew

22:14.708 --> 22:17.570
Say, I could do without you

22:17.670 --> 22:20.072
In the garden you're the gopher

22:20.172 --> 22:22.825
In the Levi's you're the loafer

22:22.925 --> 22:24.952
Like an overturned canoe

22:25.052 --> 22:27.913
Well, I can do without you

22:28.013 --> 22:30.541
You can go to Philadelphia

22:30.641 --> 22:32.877
Take a hack to Hackensack

22:32.977 --> 22:35.796
Hey, I'll never ring a bell for you

22:35.896 --> 22:37.964
Or yell for you to come back

22:38.399 --> 22:40.926
In the question you're the why

22:41.026 --> 22:43.429
In the ointment you're the fly

22:43.529 --> 22:46.348
Though I know some things
Are indispensable

22:46.448 --> 22:48.559
Like a buck or two

22:48.659 --> 22:50.436
If there's one thing I can do without

22:50.536 --> 22:53.264
I can do without you

22:56.292 --> 22:58.694
In the barrel, you're a pickle

22:58.794 --> 23:01.322
In the goldmine, you're a nickel

23:01.422 --> 23:03.574
You're the tack inside my shoe

23:03.674 --> 23:06.577
Yes, I can do without you

23:06.677 --> 23:09.079
In my bosom you're a dagger

23:09.179 --> 23:11.665
You're a mangy carpetbagger

23:11.765 --> 23:15.002
In the theater you're the boo

23:15.102 --> 23:16.879
I can do without you

23:16.979 --> 23:19.423
You got charms, they ain't bewitchin' me

23:19.523 --> 23:22.718
You've a face no one would paint

23:22.818 --> 23:24.720
I got the darndest itch in me

23:24.820 --> 23:27.181
To be wherever you ain't

23:27.281 --> 23:29.475
In the bullfrog, you're the croak

23:30.034 --> 23:32.561
In the forest, poison oak

23:32.661 --> 23:35.064
Though I know some things are necessary

23:35.164 --> 23:37.608
My half-pint buckaroo

23:37.708 --> 23:40.361
If there's one thing I can do without
I can do without...

23:40.461 --> 23:42.154
- You're a knothead
- You're a faker

23:42.254 --> 23:44.607
- You're a bonehead
- Troublemaker

23:46.091 --> 23:48.569
I can do without you

23:56.310 --> 23:58.295
Oh, Calam.

23:58.395 --> 24:02.967
The night Adelaid steps on that stage,
I'll come dressed as a Sioux squaw...

24:03.067 --> 24:04.260
lugging a papoose.

24:07.279 --> 24:12.101
I'll bring her, Bill Hickok, if I have to
drag her back with my teeth!

24:16.830 --> 24:19.650
Look out, Adelaid Adams. Rattlesnake!

24:19.750 --> 24:22.820
Salary's no object.
Promise her anything, but bring her.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.197
I've got the cigarette picture,
I'll find her.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.324
- Calam, do me a favor.
- What?

24:27.424 --> 24:31.287
When you're in Chicago, notice the
women, how they act and what they wear.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.123
Get yourself
some female clothes and fixings.

24:34.223 --> 24:37.702
You know, dresses, ribbons,
perfume, things like that.

24:38.102 --> 24:41.627
- If you don't like how I smell...
- It's nothing personal.

24:42.815 --> 24:46.552
If you ever crawled out of that deer hide
and dolled up a bit...

24:46.652 --> 24:49.551
I got a hunch
you'd be a passable, pretty gal.

24:50.864 --> 24:55.394
Well, save your hunches for females who get
their pictures taken in long underwear.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.187
I ain't one of them.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.940
- Come on. Get this schooner rolling.
- Hyah!

26:12.696 --> 26:13.888
Scalps.

26:15.783 --> 26:18.136
A massacre.

26:23.207 --> 26:24.942
Drop it, you murdering copperhead.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.700
I'll be hornswoggled.

26:55.322 --> 26:58.767
When you turn to the subject of Harry

26:58.867 --> 27:02.312
That's a horse from a different safari

27:02.412 --> 27:04.940
He can box like a fox

27:05.040 --> 27:07.693
He's as dumb as an ox

27:07.793 --> 27:11.030
But it's Harry I'm planning to marry

27:11.130 --> 27:14.324
Yes, it's Harry she's plannin' to marry

27:14.424 --> 27:19.496
My heart's twined around his suspenders

27:19.596 --> 27:25.586
He's the one that I truly adore

27:25.686 --> 27:31.300
I'm numb, I succumb when he renders

27:31.400 --> 27:34.303
The face on the bar room floor

27:34.403 --> 27:37.806
When he flexes his muscles, I flutter

27:37.906 --> 27:41.727
Like a butterfly caught in a shutter

27:41.827 --> 27:44.897
When he calls me his mate

27:45.831 --> 27:50.152
I just disintegrate

27:50.252 --> 27:51.945
Since the world first began

27:52.045 --> 27:53.655
Since the world first began

27:53.755 --> 27:55.324
Never been such a man

27:55.424 --> 27:57.117
Never been such a man

27:57.217 --> 27:58.660
Who could love like he can

27:58.760 --> 28:04.333
So it's Harry I'm planning to marry

28:23.952 --> 28:25.395
They love you, Miss Adams.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.065
Shouldn't you take another bow?
It's your last night.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.108
I'm gratefully aware of that.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.739
See that the trunks are packed,
and my costumes...

28:35.839 --> 28:39.034
Get rid of those awful things.
Sell them or do something.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.953
I'll make you a present of them.

28:41.053 --> 28:45.666
I'll buy a whole new wardrobe.
London, Vienna, Paris.

28:45.766 --> 28:48.585
How different
from this primitive Chicago.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.213
These past few weeks
have been a dreadful bore.

28:51.313 --> 28:55.338
How can you say that, Miss Adams?
They have been glorious.

28:55.901 --> 29:01.515
If I could be on the stage for one minute,
to see all those people looking up at me...

29:01.615 --> 29:03.888
listening, admiring...

29:05.202 --> 29:07.600
Like looking into the pens
at the stockyards.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.900
Hurry up, Katie.
We mustn't keep Mr. Kingsley waiting.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.653
Maybe some day I will be on the stage.

29:14.753 --> 29:18.282
Not a grand, beautiful star
like you, Miss Adams.

29:18.382 --> 29:22.661
Just to sing a song maybe.
I can dance and sing a little.

29:22.761 --> 29:27.332
Of course you can. I've heard you.
Very nice for choirs and weddings, but...

29:27.432 --> 29:30.878
I doubt that your voice would
ever carry beyond the footlights.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.839
There, now. How do I look?

29:33.939 --> 29:36.300
Beautiful, Miss Adams. Just beautiful.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.639
Even if I never sang alone,
if I were only in the chorus...

29:42.739 --> 29:45.726
couldn't you suggest it
to somebody sometime?

29:45.826 --> 29:49.188
You're not serious, Katie. Not really?

29:49.288 --> 29:51.815
My dear,
it isn't just your voice, it's...

29:51.915 --> 29:54.939
You other equipment is hardly adequate.

29:55.294 --> 30:01.026
Oh. Cheer up. Maybe I'll send for you
when I get to Paris. All right?

30:03.135 --> 30:04.487
Good night, darling.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.956
Good night.

30:47.971 --> 30:51.500
When you turn to the subject of Harry

30:51.600 --> 30:55.170
That's a horse from a different safari

30:55.270 --> 30:57.506
He can box like a fox

30:57.606 --> 31:00.259
He's as dumb as an ox

31:00.359 --> 31:04.054
But it's Harry I'm planning to marry

31:07.407 --> 31:11.061
My heart's twined around his suspenders

31:11.161 --> 31:15.983
He's the one that I truly adore

31:16.083 --> 31:20.612
I'm numb, I succumb when he renders

31:20.712 --> 31:22.735
The face on the bar room floor

31:24.091 --> 31:27.869
When he flexes his muscles, I flutter

31:27.969 --> 31:31.456
Like a butterfly caught in a shutter

31:31.556 --> 31:33.208
When he calls me his...

31:34.893 --> 31:37.166
What is it, ma'am? Where's the varmint?

31:39.398 --> 31:40.545
Who are you?

31:40.899 --> 31:45.762
Oh. My name is Canary, Miss Adams,
most folks call me Calamity.

31:45.862 --> 31:49.683
I came from Deadwood City to see you
and talk you into going back with me.

31:50.784 --> 31:55.355
Gosh almighty, you're the prettiest
thing I've ever seen.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.359
I've never known a woman
could look like that.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.774
Say.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.740
- How do you hold that dress up there?
- Please.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.660
- I have to change clothes. Do you mind?
- Helping you? Why, sure.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.621
I've plugged men for less than that.

32:11.721 --> 32:14.708
If you don't get out of here
this instant, Mr. Canary...

32:14.808 --> 32:17.252
or Mr. Calamity,
or whatever your name is...

32:17.352 --> 32:18.628
Mister?

32:18.728 --> 32:20.796
Why, I ain't no mister.

32:23.108 --> 32:26.511
- You're a woman?
- Of course, I'm a woman.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.305
You thought I was a man?

32:34.995 --> 32:37.939
Come to think of it,
that ain't so funny.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.404
I'm sorry. But those clothes,
the gun and everything.

32:44.504 --> 32:48.529
I reckon I do look a mite strange
to a lady like you.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.078
I guess I ain't much to look at.

32:51.178 --> 32:55.203
But there ain't a woman I can't
out-ride or out-shoot or...

32:57.559 --> 33:00.287
Everybody can't have a figure
like Adelaid Adams.

33:00.604 --> 33:02.672
That's a matter of opinion.

33:02.772 --> 33:06.385
In the opinion of Deadwood City,
there ain't no other opinion.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.383
Now, let's get down to business.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.595
I'd like to hire you
to come and sing in Deadwood.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.847
Me?

33:16.328 --> 33:21.400
I got a lot of nerve asking you, I know.
Deadwood City ain't no Chicago...

33:21.500 --> 33:25.445
and the Golden Garter
ain't no grand theater like this one...

33:25.545 --> 33:29.400
but they want you mighty bad,
and I promised them you'd come.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.327
Name your own salary.

33:32.427 --> 33:37.033
Well, the salary isn't important.
It's just...

33:37.766 --> 33:38.958
Me?

33:39.601 --> 33:44.005
Every prospector in the territory
is chewing himself sick with tobacco...

33:44.105 --> 33:45.832
just to get a picture of you.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.345
Tell Deadwood, Miss Adams is sorry,
but she's going to Europe.

33:52.864 --> 33:56.685
Don't you reckon you could put that off
until after you played Deadwood?

33:56.785 --> 33:59.354
Sure, I could, but...

34:00.205 --> 34:02.228
Maybe I could.

34:03.416 --> 34:06.395
It's ridiculous. I couldn't.

34:08.129 --> 34:11.199
Is this the only picture
they have of me in Deadwood?

34:11.299 --> 34:14.494
- The cigarette picture?
- I reckon so, ma'am.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.121
Where is Deadwood?

34:17.222 --> 34:19.666
Dakota Territory.
Out in the Black Hills.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.877
- Indians?
- Sioux tribe.

34:21.976 --> 34:25.338
But you needn't worry about Injuns
when you travel with Calamity Jane.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.710
Do trains go there?

34:27.190 --> 34:29.885
Well, not for the last 100 miles.

34:29.985 --> 34:32.262
- But the stage is comfortable.
- No telegraph?

34:32.362 --> 34:33.509
No.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.558
If you want to send a letter,
there's a dispatcher...

34:36.658 --> 34:41.188
If I refused, you'd poke that gun in my
back and march me to the rail road station.

34:41.288 --> 34:45.859
- Well, now...
- I'm at your mercy. Come help me pack.

34:49.087 --> 34:53.033
I got a strange feeling
someone is being hustled.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.224
Hyah! Hyah!

35:39.596 --> 35:42.249
Come on, you redskin naked heathens!

35:42.349 --> 35:45.835
Run up here and get your one-way ticket
to the happy hunting grounds!

35:45.935 --> 35:50.506
Come on, catch us! And catch that!

35:52.567 --> 35:54.419
And that!

35:58.031 --> 36:00.099
Get the steam up in them horses.

36:05.455 --> 36:07.808
Are you comfortable
in there, Miss Adams?

36:17.258 --> 36:20.078
Well, it's all over.

36:21.513 --> 36:26.414
I told you you had nothing to worry about.
Not when you're riding with Calamity.

36:28.478 --> 36:31.457
Miss Adams, you all right?

36:33.525 --> 36:34.672
Miss Adams.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.850
Calamity's back,
and she brought Adelaid Adams.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.144
Adelaid Adams.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.912
Quiet! Listen to me!

37:03.012 --> 37:05.957
All right, you mangy pack
of dirt-scratching beetles.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.410
I promised you Adelaid Adams,
and I brought her.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.050
Quiet! Wait a minute!

37:15.150 --> 37:20.507
Everybody stand back.
Let's give her a real Deadwood welcome.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.188
Throw them bags down, Rattlesnake.

37:29.706 --> 37:33.068
- Your servant, ma'am, Bill Hickok.
- Wild Bill Hickok?

37:33.168 --> 37:35.487
If I am, you could tame me, ma'am.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.615
Lieutenant Daniel Gilmartin, Miss Adams.
Yours to command.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.158
Thank you.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.368
This way, Miss Adams.

37:49.017 --> 37:54.172
Miss Adams, you are here.
I'm unworthy. My theater is unworthy.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.966
But you're a true artist. You are here.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.843
Yes, I'm here.

38:00.153 --> 38:04.474
Oh, Miss Adams, permit me to introduce
a fellow thespian, also from the East.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.184
Mr. Francis Fryer.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.603
How do you do, Mr. Fryer?

38:08.703 --> 38:11.648
Fryer. Don't I know you from somewhere?

38:11.748 --> 38:14.651
We played St. Louis
the same week last year.

38:16.586 --> 38:19.781
At... different theaters, of course.

38:21.466 --> 38:22.988
How nice to see you again.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.662
Shall we go inside, Miss Adams?

38:25.762 --> 38:29.958
Calam, you did it.
I could shoot myself with happiness.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.001
Maybe I should shoot myself
for bringing her.

38:38.566 --> 38:41.010
Now, Miss Adams,
I'll show you to your room.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.805
Finest room in the house.
Had it specially decorated.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.848
Oh, thank you.

38:49.953 --> 38:51.062
Gentlemen.

38:59.254 --> 39:03.116
- Congratulations, Calamity.
- Only Calamity could do it!

39:03.216 --> 39:06.286
I bet if she went after Sitting Bull
she'd bring him back, too.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.830
Did you see the show?
Did you see Miss Adams work?

39:08.930 --> 39:10.953
What is it like in the big city?

39:11.140 --> 39:15.170
Boys, Chicago's the biggest
noise in Illinois!

39:15.270 --> 39:16.872
Listen.

39:18.147 --> 39:20.759
I just blew in from the windy city

39:20.859 --> 39:22.927
The windy city is mighty purty

39:23.027 --> 39:28.141
But they ain't got what we got
No sirree

39:28.241 --> 39:30.685
They got shacks up to seven stories

39:30.785 --> 39:32.937
Never see any morning glories

39:33.037 --> 39:36.024
But a step from our doorway

39:36.124 --> 39:37.851
We got them for free

39:38.334 --> 39:40.820
They've got those minstrel shows

39:40.920 --> 39:43.239
Purty ladies in the big chapeaus

39:43.339 --> 39:45.825
Private lawns, public parks

39:45.925 --> 39:48.369
For the sake of civic virtue

39:48.469 --> 39:52.916
They've got fountains
there that squirt you

39:53.016 --> 39:55.585
I just blew in from the windy city

39:55.685 --> 39:57.879
The windy city is mighty purty

39:57.979 --> 40:01.090
But they ain't got what we got

40:01.190 --> 40:03.176
I'm telling you, boys

40:03.276 --> 40:08.306
We got more life in Deadwood city
Than in all of Illinois

40:08.406 --> 40:10.600
On the street was a dancin' fellow

40:10.700 --> 40:12.977
All dressed up in a suit of yellow

40:13.077 --> 40:16.147
And the dance that he did there

40:16.247 --> 40:18.941
Went somethin' like this

40:20.752 --> 40:22.445
Whistle

40:24.672 --> 40:26.240
More

41:08.466 --> 41:10.952
You should've seen me a-window shopping

41:11.052 --> 41:13.204
A-window shopping with eyes a-poppin'

41:13.304 --> 41:18.001
At the sights that you see there
Yes, sirree

41:18.476 --> 41:21.045
Press a bell and a moment later

41:21.145 --> 41:23.256
Up you go in an elevator

41:23.356 --> 41:28.553
Just as fast as
a polecat a-climbin' a tree

41:28.653 --> 41:31.055
I heard claim hundreds came

41:31.155 --> 41:33.641
To a thing they calla baseball game

41:33.741 --> 41:36.060
Cigar stores, revolving doors

41:36.160 --> 41:38.855
Men wear sideburns and they ought to

41:38.955 --> 41:44.357
Because a haircut costs a quarter

41:44.669 --> 41:47.030
I just blew in from the windy city

41:47.130 --> 41:49.324
The windy city is mighty purty

41:49.424 --> 41:52.535
But they ain't got what we got

41:52.635 --> 41:54.621
I'm tellin' you, boys

41:54.721 --> 42:01.830
I ain't a-swappin' half of Deadwood
For the whole of Illinois

42:05.273 --> 42:07.717
Hurry up. This isn't just any night.

42:07.817 --> 42:10.887
This is Adelaid Adams' night.
Hear that crowd!

42:10.987 --> 42:15.975
Billy, you've got to know.
I've got to tell you. That girl, she's...

42:16.075 --> 42:17.810
Oh, never mind.

42:17.910 --> 42:21.514
Millie, that Adelaid Adams, she isn't...
I mean, she's...

42:21.873 --> 42:25.068
What's the use if she is or if she isn't?
She's got to be.

42:25.168 --> 42:29.280
Because if she isn't, that crowd...
We'll all be...

42:29.380 --> 42:32.450
I'll have two fast horses
waiting at the stage entrance.

42:33.092 --> 42:35.870
Why? I'm not going anywhere.

42:35.970 --> 42:38.706
Actors are crazy people.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.959
Scared, aren't you, Katie Brown?

42:41.059 --> 42:43.912
You thought it was smart
posing as Adelaid Adams.

42:44.312 --> 42:48.792
Like to run like mad, wouldn't you?
Catch a train, get out of this crazy town.

42:49.275 --> 42:53.471
But you can't. You're trapped.
There is no train.

42:53.571 --> 42:56.808
Oh, clever, clever you.

42:59.202 --> 43:02.806
- Five minutes, Miss Adams.
- I'll be ready.

43:03.331 --> 43:08.608
Five minutes, and look at you.
You haven't even got a face.

43:14.383 --> 43:17.236
Gentlemen and... gentlemen.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.291
The great moment has finally arrived.

43:32.235 --> 43:36.723
There are no words to describe the beauty
of the lady you are about to meet.

43:36.823 --> 43:40.977
No melody as sweet as the voice
you are about to hear.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.369
Gosh almighty, it's Bill Hickok!

44:03.099 --> 44:05.042
Ain't he gorgeous?

44:05.810 --> 44:09.210
Wild Bill Hickok,
sweetheart of the Sioux!

44:13.025 --> 44:16.379
Where are the rest of your kids,
Pocahontas?

44:17.822 --> 44:20.300
Here, take him.

44:20.950 --> 44:24.600
Thanks. Everybody get out of here.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.142
All right. That's enough, do you hear?

44:34.463 --> 44:37.988
Bill Hickok!
The funniest sight I've ever seen.

44:38.467 --> 44:44.415
Calamity, please! He's mad.
Don't break up the show!

44:44.807 --> 44:48.081
All right, Calam. I paid my debt.

44:48.311 --> 44:51.836
The next man that laughs
is going to get his head ventilated.

45:03.159 --> 45:06.263
Calam, please! Miss Adams is waiting.

45:12.668 --> 45:17.695
The one and only, Miss Adelaid Adams.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.912
Go on out there
and give them everything, Katie.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.122
Katie?

45:34.190 --> 45:37.009
- She don't look much like her pictures.
- She's prettier.

45:39.528 --> 45:43.099
Well, now, if you've got a cutie
Who's a real sweet patootie

45:43.199 --> 45:46.352
Better keep it under your hat

45:46.452 --> 45:50.102
Just remember curiosity in fables of old

45:50.456 --> 45:51.566
Killed the curious cat

45:51.666 --> 45:54.315
What's the matter with her?
She didn't sing like that in Chicago.

45:54.418 --> 45:56.529
If you love a laddie
Who's a real sugar daddy

45:56.629 --> 45:59.778
Better take in the welcoming mat

46:00.508 --> 46:03.494
Remember there's a dozen dolls
For every Dan

46:03.594 --> 46:05.121
You're not the only sweet pea...

46:05.221 --> 46:07.874
Where's your voice, Adelaid?
You leave it in Chicago?

46:07.974 --> 46:10.626
So if you wanna know the way
To keep your man

46:10.726 --> 46:13.796
Keep it under your hat

46:14.146 --> 46:17.921
- That's the great Adelaid Adams?
- The poor, foolish kid.

46:18.025 --> 46:21.129
Well, now, if you've got cutie
Who's a real sweet patootie...

46:21.904 --> 46:23.431
Your hat

46:23.531 --> 46:28.228
Just remember curiosity in fables of old

46:29.036 --> 46:32.315
Sing out, Adelaid,
like you did in Chicago!

46:32.415 --> 46:36.395
I can't. I'm not Adelaid Adams.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.653
You're not A...?

46:45.636 --> 46:49.457
Aw, she's joshing.
Of course she's Adelaid Adams.

46:49.557 --> 46:53.377
I brought her myself, didn't I?
I ought to know. Not Adelaid Adams.

46:58.357 --> 47:02.720
Don't joke like that, Adelaid.
These galoots ain't got no sense of humor.

47:02.820 --> 47:06.515
It's not a joke. I wish it were.

47:08.909 --> 47:12.772
Please don't be angry with me.
I know I shouldn't have done it, but...

47:12.872 --> 47:16.901
Let's get this straight.
You say you're not Adelaid Adams?

47:17.001 --> 47:19.737
No, ma'am. Sir.

47:19.837 --> 47:23.282
I'm Katie Brown.

47:23.382 --> 47:25.701
Katie Brown?

47:27.136 --> 47:28.533
Calamity!

47:31.682 --> 47:34.335
You were Adelaid Adams in Chicago,
in her dressing room.

47:34.435 --> 47:37.463
I was her maid.
She gave me her costumes.

47:37.563 --> 47:41.964
She was going to Europe,
and I wanted so badly to be on the stage.

47:47.239 --> 47:50.101
- Calamity framed it.
- Yeah, bringing in Adelaide maid-.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.519
She ought to be run out of town.

47:53.371 --> 47:57.191
Fellows, listen.
What's Adelaid Adams to us, anyhow?

47:57.291 --> 47:59.402
If this is a double-cross,
all I gotta say...

47:59.502 --> 48:02.651
is you can double-cross me like this
every day of the week.

48:05.758 --> 48:10.204
I didn't know. I thought she was Adelaid.
I'm just as surprised as you are.

48:10.304 --> 48:13.157
So help me, Bill, I can't understand.

48:16.852 --> 48:20.131
Please don't blame Calamity.
She didn't know. She didn't!

48:20.231 --> 48:24.385
I fooled her just as I tried to fool you.
It's all my fault.

48:24.485 --> 48:26.804
I thought I could make you like me.

48:34.286 --> 48:36.309
Listen to me.

48:38.457 --> 48:40.184
Listen!

48:41.585 --> 48:46.191
Don't let her bull-nose you.
She ain't getting away with it this time.

48:53.431 --> 48:56.455
There, now. That's better.

48:57.143 --> 49:00.167
Ain't you ashamed of yourselves,
treating a lady this way?

49:00.271 --> 49:02.548
All right, so she ain't Adelaid Adams.

49:02.648 --> 49:05.468
She made off she was
because she wanted to be an actress.

49:05.568 --> 49:08.721
And she thought maybe
we'd give her that chance.

49:08.821 --> 49:13.392
What's wrong with that, anyhow?
We're all here on the same ticket.

49:13.784 --> 49:16.437
You all came here to Deadwood
looking for something...

49:16.537 --> 49:18.480
you couldn't find anywhere else.

49:18.622 --> 49:22.477
You're all looking for that pot of gold,
and Katie here ain't no different.

49:23.461 --> 49:25.738
Well, what have you got to say?

49:25.838 --> 49:30.993
Are you going to grouch about a picture,
or are you going to give a real live...

49:31.093 --> 49:34.955
and pretty young lady a chance
to prove she belongs here?

49:35.055 --> 49:36.374
It's up to you.

49:36.474 --> 49:40.544
- As long as she's up there, let her sing.
- All right, give her a chance.

49:40.644 --> 49:42.129
What do we've got to lose?

49:46.066 --> 49:49.428
That's all we want to hear.
Let her rip, Katie Brown.

49:49.528 --> 49:52.472
Give it all you got. Do it your own way.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.678
Play.

50:02.583 --> 50:05.694
Well, now, if you've got a cutie
Who's a real sweet patootie

50:05.794 --> 50:08.864
Better keep it under your hat

50:08.964 --> 50:12.493
Just remember curiosity in fables of old

50:12.593 --> 50:14.036
Killed the curious cat

50:14.720 --> 50:17.832
Supposin' you've got the laddie
Who's a sweet sugar daddy

50:17.932 --> 50:20.960
Better take in the welcoming mat

50:21.060 --> 50:24.088
Remember there's a dozen dolls
For every Dan

50:24.188 --> 50:27.174
You're not the only sweet pea
In the can

50:27.274 --> 50:30.761
So if you wanna know the way
To keep your man

50:30.861 --> 50:36.718
Keep it under your hat

51:09.149 --> 51:12.761
If you wanna know the way
To keep your man

51:12.861 --> 51:15.805
Keep it under your hat

51:16.407 --> 51:18.259
Keep it under your hat

51:23.497 --> 51:26.317
Keep it under your hat

51:43.601 --> 51:49.629
She is great. Deadwood doesn't need
no imported actress. We roll our own.

51:51.775 --> 51:52.922
Let me loose!

51:55.654 --> 52:01.352
Let me loose. Quit it, Bill Hickok.
So help me, I'll shoot your ears off.

52:01.452 --> 52:04.396
Quit it, I say. Let me loose.

52:04.496 --> 52:07.650
You hear what I say? Let me out of this.

52:07.750 --> 52:11.654
Bill Hickok, I'll get you,
if it's the last thing I do. Let me down.

52:11.754 --> 52:15.157
You no-good sneaking sidewinder.
Let me down out of here.

52:15.257 --> 52:18.369
Adelaid Adams?
And me in this squaw getup.

52:18.469 --> 52:21.664
You've got the biggest mouth
in the whole Dakota Territory.

52:21.764 --> 52:24.663
You flap-eared varmint, let me down.

52:30.856 --> 52:35.553
You dirty, mangy, mole-legged,
miserable son of a slinking coyote!

52:35.653 --> 52:37.380
Let me down out of here!

52:39.073 --> 52:42.427
Flap your wings, Calam, you can fly!

52:42.701 --> 52:44.562
Let me down!

52:44.662 --> 52:46.480
I'll get you for this.

53:02.930 --> 53:04.748
Here we go.

53:04.932 --> 53:08.669
You're leaving already, Miss Brown?
You only opened last night.

53:08.769 --> 53:11.922
I'm sorry. I was hoping
to get better acquainted.

53:12.022 --> 53:15.717
Getting better acquainted with him
is like making a pet out of a polecat.

53:16.026 --> 53:18.429
I think that would be very nice,
Mr. Hickok.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.639
It ain't likely I'll turn up in Chicago.

53:20.739 --> 53:23.601
Chicago? I'm not going to Chicago.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.728
You're not? Where are you going?

53:25.828 --> 53:28.647
It ain't none of your business,
squaw man.

53:28.747 --> 53:31.317
I'm moving into Calamity's
cabin with her.

53:31.417 --> 53:34.903
- You're what?
- I brought her, and I'm responsible for her.

53:35.003 --> 53:37.698
- What's the matter with the hotel?
- Nothing.

53:37.798 --> 53:41.869
There aren't many women in town and Calamity
had the idea we should live together...

53:41.969 --> 53:43.746
and sort of chaperone each other.

53:43.846 --> 53:47.576
You chaperone Calam? And she...?

53:49.727 --> 53:51.587
Oh, this ought to be interesting.

53:51.687 --> 53:54.157
We're mighty glad you approve.

53:55.524 --> 53:58.677
And, Mr. Hickok,
please feel free to drop in any time.

53:58.777 --> 54:00.054
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

54:00.154 --> 54:01.639
Feel it, but don't try it.

54:09.455 --> 54:11.982
- Come on in, Bill, I'll get you a drink.
- No thanks.

54:12.082 --> 54:15.152
If I felt any higher, I'd be flying!

54:15.252 --> 54:18.652
Harry, come here.
I want you to do something for me.

54:39.568 --> 54:44.098
My heart is higher than a hawk

54:44.198 --> 54:47.802
My love is deeper than a well

54:48.577 --> 54:51.897
I'm thinkin' in a little while

54:51.997 --> 54:55.852
My love and I'll be doin' very well

54:57.044 --> 55:00.614
An owl is givin' me the eye

55:00.714 --> 55:05.327
The wind is blowin' me a kiss

55:05.427 --> 55:09.331
I wouldn't be at all surprised

55:09.431 --> 55:14.378
If I were only dreamin' all of this

55:14.478 --> 55:18.257
And when I strut about like a Sunny Jim

55:18.357 --> 55:20.843
Dressed in yellow and red

55:20.943 --> 55:23.721
Folks'll shout, "Take a look at him

55:23.821 --> 55:27.721
He's touched in the head"

55:28.116 --> 55:32.354
I said that I would never fall

55:32.454 --> 55:36.525
I laughed at others when they fell

55:36.625 --> 55:42.281
And here I'm falling

55:42.381 --> 55:44.867
Higher than a hawk

55:44.967 --> 55:49.288
And deeper than a well

55:51.640 --> 55:57.755
And when we're all rigged out
Like a birthday cake

55:57.855 --> 56:00.883
Eyes'll pop everywhere

56:00.983 --> 56:08.092
Folks'll shout, "Don't you think
they make a wonderful pair?"

56:08.782 --> 56:14.688
I said that I would never fall

56:14.788 --> 56:19.318
But if you promise not to tell

56:19.418 --> 56:25.199
My love for you

56:25.299 --> 56:29.244
Is higher than a hawk

56:29.344 --> 56:34.826
And deeper than a well

56:49.615 --> 56:51.058
Ho.

56:51.241 --> 56:55.062
Well, there she sets.
Just where I left her.

57:16.224 --> 57:18.877
I won that cabin
from a Kansas fellow in a poker game.

57:18.977 --> 57:21.205
A week before he died of lead poisoning.

57:21.521 --> 57:22.965
Bill was in that game.

57:24.650 --> 57:26.969
He lost everything but his fillings.

57:27.694 --> 57:30.556
- Oh. Let me help you down.
- Thank you.

57:30.656 --> 57:33.433
Do you dislike Mr. Hickok
as much as you pretend to?

57:33.533 --> 57:39.398
Dislike Bill? Me and Bill are thicker
than flies in a Pawnee camp.

57:39.498 --> 57:43.648
We're like the seven-year itch
to each other, but it's fun scratching.

57:44.419 --> 57:48.194
Yup, that Bill Hickok is about
the best friend I ever had.

57:48.382 --> 57:50.450
Of course, my sparky taste...

57:50.550 --> 57:53.829
that kind of runs to blue uniforms
and shiny buttons.

57:53.929 --> 57:57.829
- Like second lieutenants wear?
- Like second...

57:58.809 --> 58:00.286
Lieutenants wear.

58:10.946 --> 58:12.889
Make yourself right at home.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.187
Be careful.

58:21.331 --> 58:26.528
Yep. You and me will batch it here
as cozy as two bugs in a blanket.

58:28.964 --> 58:30.616
Excuse me.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.868
I reckon it needs a little airing
around here.

58:32.968 --> 58:35.704
Ain't used the place much,
it's too lonesome.

58:35.804 --> 58:39.078
I like to bunk out in the open
under a wagon or something.

58:39.808 --> 58:43.754
I know one thing we'll have plenty of:
Home cooking.

58:43.854 --> 58:47.341
Just hand me a sack of flour
and bacon grease...

58:47.441 --> 58:49.509
Looks like we're out of water.

58:49.860 --> 58:53.096
It's right handy though,
I get it from the creek down there.

58:53.196 --> 58:55.549
That's one good thing about this place.

59:01.121 --> 59:03.895
No, I guess there's nothing
good about it.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.606
I'm sorry, Katie.

59:08.003 --> 59:12.700
- Oh, it will be all right, Calam. Fine.
- No, it won't.

59:13.300 --> 59:16.153
It ain't fit for a dog,
let alone a lady.

59:16.803 --> 59:19.247
I didn't know it till you came in here.

59:20.140 --> 59:22.918
Just like I didn't know how far
from being a lady I was...

59:23.018 --> 59:26.042
till I saw you in that dressing room
in Chicago.

59:27.147 --> 59:32.253
What do I know about nice things?
I ain't never had any.

59:34.696 --> 59:38.346
Come on,
I'll drive you back to the hotel.

59:39.284 --> 59:41.186
I'm staying right here.

59:41.286 --> 59:43.188
In this rat's nest?

59:43.288 --> 59:49.277
We can fix it. Make it real nice.
All it needs is a woman's touch.

59:49.377 --> 59:51.195
A woman's touch?

59:57.761 --> 59:59.413
A woman's touch

59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.123
A woman's touch

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:04.459
The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much

01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:06.169
She's a wizard, she's a champ

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:08.872
And she doesn't need a lamp

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.844
A woman's touch can weave a spell

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:17.264
The kind of hocus pocus
That she does so well

01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:18.932
With the magic of a broom

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.931
You can mesmerize a room

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.775
With a whisk, whisk here
And a whisk, whisk there

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.318
And a dustpan for the cinders

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:33.989
With a rub-rub here and a rub-rub there
You can polish up the windows

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:36.033
Then presto, change-o

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:41.371
Suddenly the sun comes shining through

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:45.042
- And what does Mr. Sunshine say to you?
- Howdy-do

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:48.587
It makes you blink to stop and think

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:54.009
A woman and a whisk-broom
Can accomplish so darn much

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:59.181
So never underestimate a woman's touch

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:46.144
A woman's touch can quickly fill

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:49.648
The empty flower boxes on a window sill

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:51.441
One smile from her and zoom

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:54.190
Little buds begin to bloom

01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:04.538
A touch of paint

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.331
A magic nail

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:09.793
Can turn a kitchen chair
into a Chippendale

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.503
Even make the lamp appear

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:14.582
Like a crystal chandelier

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:19.427
With a tack, tack here and a tack, tack there
And a hand around a hammer

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:24.224
With a mop, mop here and a mop, mop there
You can give a cabin glamour

01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:15.734
Then gosh almighty, all at once

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:19.654
The cabin that we knew

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:24.242
Becomes a shining castle built for two

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:26.911
Me and you

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:33.335
The pies and cakes a woman bakes

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:35.587
Can make a fellow tell her

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:38.465
That he loves her very much

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:40.258
It can?

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:45.259
So never underestimate a woman's touch

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:56.900
It's up to me? I'll bet $40.

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:02.989
Howdy, Lieutenant. Care to take a hand?

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:05.863
Not now, thanks. You see...

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.073
I'm looking for...

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:09.852
No, not now.

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:14.330
It's up to you, Bill. Call or fold?

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:18.380
- Where are you going?
- The same place the lieutenant's going.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.753
Only I'm going to be there first.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:27.430
All right, all right, I've got ears.
I'm coming.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:31.017
- I'd like to see Miss Brown.
- You and every other rooster in town.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:34.312
She's not staying here.
She moved in with Calamity.

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:37.391
Maybe I'd better have a sign painted.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.689
With Calamity?

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:11.433
Where are you going, Calam?

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:14.311
Herb Potter's got tick fever,
he's at his cabin by himself.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.895
He needs some doing for him.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.272
No shoes?

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:19.566
I can't wear shoes across the creek.

01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:35.248
Bill.

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:37.500
- Hello, Katie.
- Lieutenant.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.170
Say, that's a right smart harness
you're wearing.

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.922
You just keep on getting prettier and...

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:50.597
- Here.
- They're very nice. Calamity loves flowers.

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:54.601
- The lieutenant never calls without them.
- Wait.

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.223
I brought them for...

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:57.812
Where is Calamity?

01:05:57.912 --> 01:06:01.232
Up the hill visiting a sick prospector.
Won't you come in?

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:05.437
That's Calam,
just can't resist a distress signal.

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:15.747
- This ain't Calam's cabin.
- It sure doesn't look like it.

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:19.042
We fixed it up a little.
Sit down and I'll make you some tea.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:20.585
It won't take a minute.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:28.214
Say... lieutenant,
don't they need you back at the fort?

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:29.928
They'll manage.

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:34.216
I thought you had a poker game going.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.518
There's always a poker game going.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:40.730
With the Cheyennes on the war path,
folks would feel a heap safer...

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:44.526
if you soldiers didn't gallivant around
so much, wasting taxpayer's money.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:50.949
Nice of you to think of the taxpayers,
after the money you cost them in funerals.

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.366
Yeah.

01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:05.376
Oh, dear.

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:10.468
I'm all out of wood.
I'll have to go out and chop some.

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:12.637
- I'll do it.
- Here, let me.

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:16.967
- I hate to trouble you, Bill.
- No trouble at all, ma'am.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.732
Katie.

01:07:24.832 --> 01:07:29.863
It was very thoughtful of you
and Mr. Hickok to look in on us.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:37.072
But then, Deadwood is that kind of a town.
I mean, everyone's so friendly and nice.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:42.083
Well, after the fool I made
of myself the other night...

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:44.919
the way they forgave me
and let me go on.

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:47.213
Anyone could forgive you
anything, Katie.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:51.668
Not anything, lieutenant.
And not Calamity.

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:55.555
I don't know what idea you have
about Calamity and me, but...

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:58.008
It's not my idea, it's hers.

01:07:58.533 --> 01:07:59.934
She's in love with you.

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:01.728
But that's ridiculous.

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:05.565
We're friends, good friends.
She even saved my life.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:09.611
- But you can't believe that I and she...
- I like Calamity, lieutenant.

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:11.196
She's been very good to me.

01:08:11.296 --> 01:08:14.991
I would no more think of coming
between her and the man she loves...

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:18.786
The man she loves? Katie, I swear I...

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.586
Well, fancy that,
it was there all the time.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.129
Danny, believe me...

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:33.214
- Here we are. It didn't take long, did it?
- Not long enough.

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:47.432
The... shawl, it fell o...

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.652
Let's have tea.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:09:00.078
They've got a new commander at the fort,
General Stark. He says he knows you.

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:02.913
Yes, I served under him in Virginia
during the war.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:06.125
They're having a ball in his honor
Saturday night. I thought you...

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:10.330
I've been invited myself.
I kind of hoped you'd go with me, Katie.

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:12.256
She is going with me.

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:15.551
It's customary, lieutenant,
to let the lady choose for herself.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:20.348
- Couldn't the... four of us go together?
- What four of us?

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:24.227
Well, you, Bill, me and Calamity.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.429
Calamity?

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:31.479
She's been invited too,
and if she doesn't go, I won't either.

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:34.687
She's been expecting you to ask her,
lieutenant.

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.740
Me? Why me? I told you how I...

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.576
That's a smart arrangement.
Settles everything.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.911
Calam goes with the lieutenant,
you go with me.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.830
Over my dead body.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:47.207
Get a little respect in your voice
when you talk about Calam...

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.661
or it might just be that way.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.087
- She's a mighty fine girl.
- Girl?

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:55.091
- You should be proud to take her.
- You would be, wouldn't you?

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.801
I sure would.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:10:00.263
Me? Wait, I ain't gonna be stampeded
into no fast shuffle here.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.390
I know what you're thinking,
both of you.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.351
Calamity's fine on top of a stagecoach
or behind an ox team.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:09.272
But she's not lady enough for social
appearances with distinguished gentlemen.

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:11.600
Well, she ain't beautiful.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:24.996
Calamity's not beautiful? You boys
have a big surprise in store for you.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:30.001
There's only one way to settle this,
and that's to draw straws.

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:33.296
The long straw gets Katie
and the loser takes Calam.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.544
Is that all right with you, Katie?

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:37.842
Draw, Lieutenant.

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.472
I won!

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:46.059
- I'll have the prettiest girl at the ball.
- Don't bet on it.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:49.183
Bill, keep your eyes on that door.

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:55.018
Calamity!

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:59.363
I fell in that dangblasted creek!

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:07.747
Gosh almighty, look who's here.

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:10.833
What brought you
to this neck of the woods?

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.251
Injun trouble?

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:16.339
They came to ask you to go to the ball.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.337
Both of you?

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:21.177
That's plumb flattering.

01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:26.307
- Only I can't go with both of you.
- It's all right. We drew straws.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.810
You did? Who won?

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.263
- Well...
- I did, Calam.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:37.694
Oh. Oh, you did? Well, that's fine, Bill.
That's mighty fine.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.946
Can't think
who I'd rather tag along with.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:44.742
Try to get yourself cleaned up
by Saturday, and I'll call for you.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:47.161
I hear tell it'll be
a plumb fancy affair.

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:50.957
Soldiers in dress uniforms,
ladies in fancy gowns.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:53.376
I've never been
to a big shindig like that.

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:56.955
I reckon I'll burst my corset strings
in the pride of just being asked.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.336
I'll fix you some tea.

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:01.960
Danny.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:09.267
Ask Katie to go, Danny.
I know you want to take me, but ask her.

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:12.471
Do it for me, Danny, please.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:15.185
You're quite a lady, Calamity.

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:35.668
- Did you have to wear that old army coat?
- Old coat?

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:38.588
It was Custer's, Bill.
He gave it to me himself.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:42.425
If it's good enough for Custer,
it ought to be good enough for Fort Scully.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:46.763
This ain't no scalping expedition
against Sitting Bull. We're going to a ball.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:51.309
I know it. We sure got a night for it,
ain't we, Bill?

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:54.012
Don't it thrill you
just to look at them hills?

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.600
It sure does.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:13:00.352
No wonder the Injuns fight so fierce
to hang on to this country.

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:12.580
Take me back to the Black Hills

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.250
The Black Hills of Dakota

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:23.459
To the beautiful
Indian country that I love

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:29.263
Lost my heart in the Black Hills

01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:33.100
The Black Hills of Dakota

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.436
Where the pines are so high

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:40.650
That they kiss the sky above

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:46.030
And when I get that lonesome feelin'

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:50.743
And I'm miles away from home

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:55.164
I hear the voice of the mystic mountains

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:59.085
Calling me back home

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:03.714
- So take me back to the Black Hills
- So take me back to the Black Hills

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:07.677
- The Black Hills of Dakota
- The Black Hills of Dakota

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:14.886
- To the beautiful Indian country that I love
- To the beautiful Indian country that I love

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:24.944
Take me back to the Black Hills

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:28.823
The Black Hills of Dakota

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:36.032
To the beautiful
Indian country that I love

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.669
Lost my heart in the Black Hills

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:45.298
- The Black Hills of Dakota
- The Black Hills of Dakota

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:48.092
- Where the pines are so high
- Where the pines are so high

01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:52.638
- That they kiss the sky above
- That they kiss the sky above

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:58.227
- And when I get that lonesome feelin'
- And when I get that lonesome feelin'

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:02.899
- And I'm miles away from home
- And I'm miles away from home

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:07.320
- I hear the voice of the mystic mountains
- I hear the voice of the mystic mountains

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.157
- Callin' me back home
- Callin' me back home

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:15.870
So take me back to the Black Hills

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:19.370
The Black Hills of Dakota

01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:26.916
To the beautiful Indian
country that I love

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:34.472
- To the beautiful Indian country
- To the beautiful Indian country

01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:41.681
- That I love
- That I love

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.924
That can't be Calamity.

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:36.632
Why, she's beautiful!

01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:39.589
What happened to her?

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:53.319
Save one for me, Miss Calamity.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:56.322
Wait a minute, fellows.

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:58.741
I can't get all your names
on this here card.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:00.159
I can't even spell most of them.

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:02.703
That's all I got room for.

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:04.905
What you need is a bigger card!

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.335
Calamity has been holding out on us,
carrying concealed weapons.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:14.840
How come all these galoots
want to dance with me?

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.343
At that shindig at Hogan's stable,
none of them came around.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:20.596
- They didn't?
- I spent the night chatting with the mules.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:25.597
That's what I've been telling you,
that you'd look better in a dress.

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:27.435
Do I, Danny?

01:18:27.995 --> 01:18:30.063
You're an absolute vision, Calamity.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:32.817
Calamity, is this dance open?

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:35.395
Well, I'm kind of saving this one.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.160
Come on, Calam.

01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:50.835
Danny hasn't even asked me for a dance.

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:55.916
I know.
Katie and him are thicker than molasses.

01:18:57.107 --> 01:18:59.255
Bill, look there.

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:06.759
He's taking her out in the garden.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:18.149
Katie.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:20.698
Katie, darling.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:23.405
Danny, we shouldn't.

01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:25.574
I love you, Katie.

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:28.034
I...

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.907
Danny...

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:33.915
What about Calamity?

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:38.507
Calamity can be your bridesmaid.

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:02.156
Calam, wait.

01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:04.617
- Where are you going?
- Home.

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:06.535
I brought her here. Me.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:10.414
All the way from Chicago.
Just to make love to Danny.

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:15.878
So help me, this town ain't big enough for me
and that flirting, man-rustling petticoat!

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:20.007
It ain't that serious. People always
act silly at these sociables.

01:20:20.107 --> 01:20:24.007
You saw them out in that garden.
They weren't acting!

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:39.769
- Give me that gun.
- Stand clear, Bill Hickok.

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:42.946
I don't see her anywhere, Danny.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:46.533
You're the only person in the world
who'd worry about Calamity.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.013
Bridesmaid?

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:12.976
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:19.483
She ain't nothing but a miserable,
two-timing claim jumper.

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:24.029
Oh! Help me get out of
this dangblasted thing!

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:26.065
Well, stand still.

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:30.236
I even took her in my own cabin
because I figured she'd need protection.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:34.490
Like a weasel in a hencoop,
she needs protection!

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:47.552
Throw that in with the rest
of her man-traps.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:51.432
And that! And that!

01:21:51.532 --> 01:21:53.892
I bet it wasn't the first time
she kissed him.

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:57.642
I bet it's been going on all the time.
Here in my own cabin.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.649
Gosh almighty, I'm dumb!

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:05.404
If you have to blame somebody,
blame that pretty-boy lieutenant of yours.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:08.824
It seems to me he was
on the other end of the kissing.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:11.702
She charmed him hog-eyed.

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:17.124
Look at these. Silk. Pure silk.
I'll bet her mother spun them.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:23.464
Here. Take them to her!
Tell her to keep out of my sight!

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:26.342
So help me, Bill,
if I ever see her again...

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:29.636
I'll put a bullet smack in the middle
of that pretty face!

01:22:29.736 --> 01:22:32.089
In both of them!

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:04.671
When you turn to the subject of Harry

01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:07.758
That's a horse from a different safari

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:10.131
He can box like a fox

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:13.096
He's as dumb as an ox

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:19.637
But it's Harry I'm planning to marry

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:24.525
When he flexes his muscles, I flutter

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.360
Like a butterfly caught in a shutter

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:29.738
- Sarsaparilla.
- Calam, where have you been?

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:33.442
Katie said to tell you if you come in,
she'd like to see you.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:38.080
She's going to see me. Right now.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.165
And it's Harry I'm planning to marry

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:42.333
There's going to be trouble.

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:51.260
My heart's twined around his suspenders

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.840
He's the one that I truly a...

01:23:58.367 --> 01:23:59.764
What do you want, Calamity?

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:04.432
There's a stage leaving
at noon tomorrow. Be on it.

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:09.190
Are you threatening me?

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:12.231
I'm warning you.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:18.829
What is it? What's going on?

01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:22.624
Calamity just warned Katie
to get out of town.

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:27.880
Buck, lend me a gun.

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:35.884
Calamity.

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:40.137
Hold up your glass.

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:53.022
What's the matter? Afraid?

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:15.677
Katie's done it!

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:48.544
Imagine Katie making a shot like that.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:02.390
- Where are you going, Calam? Come here.
- Leave me be.

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:08.267
- Get in that buggy.
- Let go of me!

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:13.394
Get in there or I'll knock you senseless,
if you had any sense.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.364
Come on! Hyah! Hyah!

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:28.709
I've seen you do lots of crazy things...

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:32.462
but this is the first time
I've seen you make a fool of yourself.

01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:34.214
Sit down and listen.

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:35.799
You're a fake, Calam.

01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:40.053
You dress, talk, ride and shoot
like a man, but you think like a female.

01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:43.432
Like a green-eyed, snarling,
spitting female.

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:47.728
Katie beat you twice, out of your man
and out of the respect you had around here.

01:26:47.828 --> 01:26:49.688
And you helped her.

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:51.773
I did too.

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:56.778
She didn't shoot the glass out of
your hand, I did. You needed a lesson.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:59.281
Who are you to tell people who to love?

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:03.285
Suppose you did scare her out of town,
would that get your lieutenant back?

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:07.035
Would that stop Katie from loving him,
or him her?

01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:09.290
That's female thinking.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:13.204
He'd bring her back,
and they would both hate you.

01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:17.883
You had to lose tonight, Calam,
or you'd never win again.

01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:30.562
Go on, bawl. Admit you're a female.

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:36.019
Have your hysterics, get them over with.
You'll feel better.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:39.195
I was so plumb crazy about him.

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:45.031
I know. I felt the same way about her.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.997
You mean, you're in love with Katie?

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:50.832
It's funny, ain't it?

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:54.332
- Bill, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- Aw.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:55.955
That's all right.

01:27:56.438 --> 01:28:00.884
It'll take some time, but I'll get over it.
You will too.

01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:05.339
- No, I won't. Not Danny.
- Yes, you will.

01:28:05.572 --> 01:28:08.934
All I've done for months
is dream about him.

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:11.520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:15.850
About getting married,
and building a cabin...

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.606
and having young'uns.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:23.698
I know it sounds silly, I guess, but...

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:27.076
Bill, I really wanted all those things.

01:28:27.677 --> 01:28:31.077
I was kind of hankering for them myself.

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:39.256
There'll never be another man like him.
Not for me. Not ever.

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:44.962
It ain't going to be easy
getting her out of my system either.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:48.882
She was so beautiful and...

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:53.011
Beautiful and...

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:06.108
- Bill.
- Calam.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:15.121
Hey. What ever happened to that
lieutenant you were telling me about?

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:18.253
I never heard of him.

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:14.928
Once I had a secret love

01:30:15.368 --> 01:30:22.477
That lived within the heart of me

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:30.534
All too soon my secret love

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:37.743
Became impatient to be free

01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:46.842
So I told a friendly star

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:54.051
The way that dreamers often do

01:30:56.242 --> 01:31:03.024
Just how wonderful you are

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:10.153
And why I'm so in love with you

01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:17.038
Now I shout it

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:23.628
From the highest hills

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:30.837
Even told the golden daffodils

01:31:33.279 --> 01:31:40.388
At last my heart's an open door

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:51.281
And my secret love's no secret

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:57.621
Anymore

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:31.404
Now I shout it

01:32:31.504 --> 01:32:37.327
From the highest hills

01:32:38.094 --> 01:32:45.203
Even told the golden daffodils

01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:54.880
At last my heart's an open door

01:32:59.949 --> 01:33:06.564
And my secret love's no secret

01:33:06.664 --> 01:33:13.443
Anymore

01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:26.284
Howdy, Flanagan.

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:34.793
Say, how's the claim panning out?

01:33:38.822 --> 01:33:41.474
The way she acted,
no wonder nobody will talk to her.

01:33:41.574 --> 01:33:45.474
I hope she don't speak to me.
I hate to insult women.

01:33:59.384 --> 01:34:03.239
Howdy, fellows. Morning, Billy.

01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:13.416
- Howdy, Francis.
- Hello, Calamity.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:16.301
Have you seen Bill around here anywhere?

01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:19.630
He and Colorado
are out working their claim.

01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:22.807
How come they're taking down them signs?

01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:25.143
Katie's not here anymore.

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:26.686
Where is she?

01:34:27.579 --> 01:34:32.317
She ain't been hurt? Is she sick?
Tell me, Francis, where is she?

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.360
On her way back to Chicago.

01:34:35.461 --> 01:34:37.734
Chicago?

01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:43.036
You warned her to get out of town,
didn't you? Well, she got.

01:34:43.136 --> 01:34:45.997
But I didn't mean it! I was loco.

01:34:46.097 --> 01:34:48.792
I didn't want her to go.
That's what I came to tell her.

01:34:48.892 --> 01:34:51.377
You're late.
The stage left a half hour ago.

01:34:51.477 --> 01:34:53.250
The town is going to miss that kid.

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:55.590
- We sure will.
- Everybody will miss her.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.802
I didn't think she'd go, I swear it.

01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:03.848
She wasn't scared. She shot back at me.
Why would she go away? Why?

01:35:03.948 --> 01:35:06.101
Because she's a lady, Calamity.

01:35:06.201 --> 01:35:11.064
She's not mean and selfish and never
learned to wreck people's lives like...

01:35:11.164 --> 01:35:13.566
Like me. Say it.

01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:19.819
I don't have to say it. She left this note.
It says everything. Listen.

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:23.284
"Dear Danny, Calamity loves you and..."

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:26.158
- But, I don't!
- Shut up and listen!

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:29.374
"Calamity loves you
and you probably love her.

01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:34.546
I had no right to come between you.
I love you both and want you to be happy.

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:37.549
Pretend it was Adelaid Adams
who came to Deadwood.

01:35:37.649 --> 01:35:42.971
Katie Brown never existed.
She doesn't now. Goodbye, Danny."

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:44.722
Never existed?

01:35:44.822 --> 01:35:48.426
She was the most real person
in Deadwood.

01:35:49.827 --> 01:35:54.899
Put them signs back up, Millie.
I'm bringing that stage back here!

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:16.796
Hey, Calam, where are you going?

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:23.132
Come on!

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:27.265
I don't know what kind of life you'll have
living with that catamount...

01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:28.808
but it ain't gonna be dull.

01:36:28.908 --> 01:36:30.305
That's for dang sure.

01:37:23.588 --> 01:37:25.406
Hey, Rattlesnake.

01:37:28.926 --> 01:37:31.745
Rattlesnake, stop.

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:41.214
Hot-headed old possum.
Why don't you stop when I yell?

01:37:41.314 --> 01:37:44.509
I thought you was injuns.

01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:51.349
Katie, I'm going to get married.

01:37:51.449 --> 01:37:53.309
Congratulations.

01:37:53.409 --> 01:37:55.353
Rattlesnake, stop this coach.

01:37:55.453 --> 01:37:57.351
Whoa! Whoa, there!

01:37:58.247 --> 01:38:00.566
But I'm going to be Mrs. Hickok.

01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:05.488
Bill? But I thought you loved Danny.

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:10.660
Oh, that's female thinking.
Nothing will get you into more trouble.

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:14.990
Well, where are we heading,
Chicago or back to Deadwood?

01:38:15.765 --> 01:38:17.993
Deadwood, Calam. Home.

01:38:18.518 --> 01:38:20.712
- Katie.
- Oh, Calam.

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:26.426
Females. Pure females.

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:42.936
Now I shout it from the highest hills

01:38:44.252 --> 01:38:51.361
Even told the golden daffodils

01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:59.369
At last my heart's an open door

01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:07.925
And my secret love's no secret

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:14.053
Anymore

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:16.893
Ain't going back to the windy city

01:39:16.993 --> 01:39:19.103
The windy city is mighty pretty

01:39:19.203 --> 01:39:21.981
But it ain't got what I've got

01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:23.900
I'm telling you, boys

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.237
I wouldn't trade this golden nugget

01:39:28.337 --> 01:39:35.321
For the whole of Illinois

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:44.796
My heart is higher than a hawk

01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:48.633
My love is deeper than a well

01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:51.928
I'm thinkin' in a little while

01:39:52.028 --> 01:39:57.134
My love and I'll be doin' very well

01:39:57.492 --> 01:39:58.935
Hey.

01:40:00.786 --> 01:40:02.063
What's this for?

01:40:02.163 --> 01:40:05.775
Well, that's just in case any more
actresses roll in from Chicago.

01:40:26.938 --> 01:40:31.467
We'll be home tonight
By the light of the silvery moon

01:40:31.567 --> 01:40:35.717
And my hearts a-thumpin'
Like a mandolin a-plunkin' a tune

01:40:36.072 --> 01:40:39.809
- When we get home, we're fixin' to stay
- When we get home, we're fixin' to stay

01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:44.147
So whip crack away, whip crack away
Whip crack away

01:40:44.247 --> 01:40:48.693
Oh, the Deadwood stage
Is a-rollin' on over the plains

01:40:48.793 --> 01:40:53.281
With the curtains flappin'
And the driver slappin' the reins

01:40:53.381 --> 01:40:56.234
Beautiful sky, a wonderful day

01:40:57.510 --> 01:41:01.660
Whip crack away, whip crack away
Whip crack away

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:08.829
Whip crack away, whip crack away
Whip crack away

01:41:09.305 --> 01:41:15.317
