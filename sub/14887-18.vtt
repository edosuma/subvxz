...wasn't that
the best circus you ever see?

14:14.955 --> 14:17.490
How about that Joko
The Human Fireball?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.359
What an entertainer.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.228
I just hope they got him
to the hospital okay.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.463
‐ Balki‐‐
‐ Uh...

14:23.496 --> 14:25.666
The‐the daring young man
on the flying trapeze...

14:25.699 --> 14:27.200
What kind of a person

14:27.233 --> 14:29.335
would climb 25 feet
up in the air

14:29.369 --> 14:32.438
then just drop off
and then swing back

14:32.472 --> 14:35.341
and forth
and back and forth

14:35.375 --> 14:38.444
and then just
hand himself to somebody?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.113
[squeaking]

14:43.584 --> 14:47.554
Cousin, cousin, I have
a storm in my brain.

14:47.588 --> 14:50.290
Why don't we
invite the girls down

14:50.323 --> 14:52.559
and rent a movie
and get ourselves a pizza‐‐

14:52.593 --> 14:53.627
Balki, Balki, Balki...

14:53.660 --> 14:56.462
...why don't you give the girls
and me a night off?

14:56.496 --> 14:57.531
For the past three weeks

14:57.564 --> 14:59.566
you‐you've dragged us around
to every amusement park

14:59.600 --> 15:02.969
zoo, movie and video arcade
in Chicago.

15:03.003 --> 15:06.640
Well, excuse me
for being fun.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.975
[blowing whistle]

15:10.276 --> 15:11.978
[squeaking]

15:15.048 --> 15:16.249
[squeaking]

15:21.387 --> 15:23.023
Okay, I know.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.225
I'll make some popcorn
and we can practice catching it

15:25.258 --> 15:27.193
in our mouths.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.629
Balki, Balki

15:28.662 --> 15:30.230
this is Cousin Larry.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.698
You don't have to do this.

15:31.732 --> 15:34.601
No, cousin, it's no bother.
I love making popcorn.

15:34.635 --> 15:36.570
No, no, not that.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.473
I mean, you don't have
to pretend

15:40.507 --> 15:42.509
you're happy around me.

15:42.543 --> 15:43.977
What are you talking about?

15:44.010 --> 15:45.512
I'm happy.

15:45.546 --> 15:46.747
You're not happy.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.149
‐ I am happy.
‐ No, you're not.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.717
‐ I'm happy!
‐ No, you're not.

15:50.751 --> 15:53.720
‐ I'm happy.
‐ No, you're not.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.523
I'm happy.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.726
Now let it go.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.531
Okay, fine.
You're happy.

16:04.565 --> 16:06.600
Your yaya dies
and you're happy.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.635
It makes perfect sense.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.473
Okay, cousin,
I'm not happy.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.443
Let me explain
something to you.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.281
I've been prepared
for this.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.617
On Yaya Biki's 100th birthday

16:23.650 --> 16:26.319
she pulled me aside,
she said, "Balki...

16:26.352 --> 16:28.722
...today, I am 100 years old.

16:28.755 --> 16:32.192
Chances are I'm not going
to make another hundred.

16:35.461 --> 16:38.331
So when I go,

16:38.364 --> 16:41.201
please just go on
with your life

16:41.234 --> 16:43.036
as if nothing happened.

16:43.069 --> 16:46.573
Please, promise me this
so that I can rest in peace."

16:46.607 --> 16:48.374
I promised her that

16:48.408 --> 16:50.443
and that's all
there is to it.

16:50.777 --> 16:51.845
Well...

16:51.878 --> 16:55.181
Well, you're not going on
as if nothing has happened.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.449
You're doing happy things

16:56.482 --> 16:58.719
but I can see
you're hurting inside

16:58.752 --> 17:00.120
and you're trying to hide it.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.555
You can't hide it from me,
Balki.

17:01.588 --> 17:02.589
I know you too well.

17:02.623 --> 17:04.691
Cousin,
I'm trying to do

17:04.724 --> 17:07.359
what I promised Yaya Biki
I would do.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.164
Yaya Biki was very wise.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.734
And I'm sure she wanted
to make things easier for you.

17:14.768 --> 17:15.801
But if she could see you now

17:15.836 --> 17:18.371
she'd say she made a mistake.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.808
When someone close to you dies

17:21.842 --> 17:23.476
you have to mourn for them.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.145
No.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.146
No, no.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.350
[sighing]

17:35.789 --> 17:39.392
I had an uncle
whose wife died

17:39.425 --> 17:42.362
and he had a very
hard time getting over it.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.667
He held things in...

17:47.768 --> 17:50.236
...but the poor guy
was a wreck.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.506
So he tried something.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.507
[Balki sighing]

17:53.540 --> 17:55.709
He wrote a letter
to his wife

17:55.742 --> 17:57.110
telling her all the things

17:57.143 --> 17:59.445
he wished
he could say to her.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.083
And did this make
everything better?

18:04.217 --> 18:07.588
Well... it made things
a little better.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.157
But if you don't
wanna write to her

18:11.191 --> 18:12.793
try talking to her.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.561
It, it doesn't matter
what you do.

18:14.595 --> 18:17.698
The important thing is
to get it out, to...

18:19.733 --> 18:21.768
...to say goodbye.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.706
I don't want
to say goodbye.

18:28.742 --> 18:30.443
Well...

18:30.476 --> 18:33.246
...I'm only trying to help.

18:34.715 --> 18:36.917
I'm gonna go upstairs
and, uh, tell the girls

18:36.950 --> 18:38.284
they don't have to
come down tonight

18:38.318 --> 18:40.186
and watch you be happy.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.668
[door closing]

18:55.569 --> 18:57.203
What, what...

18:58.471 --> 19:00.173
[sighing]

19:11.618 --> 19:12.819
[sighing]

19:12.853 --> 19:14.655
Well, yaya, here we are.

19:14.688 --> 19:17.323
Oh, what the...

19:17.357 --> 19:18.759
[sighing]

19:20.360 --> 19:21.494
[sighing]

19:23.396 --> 19:26.366
[instrumental music]

19:43.383 --> 19:44.685
[sighing]

19:45.752 --> 19:47.521
Yaya...

19:49.389 --> 19:51.525
...here I am...

19:51.558 --> 19:53.994
...in America...

19:54.027 --> 19:56.329
...just where you
wanted me to be.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.633
I...

19:59.666 --> 20:03.236
I know it was your dream
to come here too.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.306
I just wish you could've seen
more of this country.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.977
I was thinking...

20:11.011 --> 20:13.947
...maybe you saw
the Statue of Liberty

20:13.980 --> 20:16.650
from the window
of your airplane.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.953
Wasn't she beautiful?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.757
I remember...

20:23.790 --> 20:27.293
...the first time
I ever saw her.

20:27.327 --> 20:31.031
I was, I was sailing
into New York Harbor

20:31.064 --> 20:32.899
on the tramp steamer...

20:32.933 --> 20:36.036
...and the sun
was coming up

20:36.069 --> 20:38.839
and... there she was...

20:39.840 --> 20:42.408
...just like you said...

20:42.442 --> 20:44.678
...bringing light
to the world.

20:45.879 --> 20:48.549
And... it was...

20:48.582 --> 20:52.252
...the most wonderful
day of my life.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.723
And... you...

20:58.324 --> 21:00.661
...made that day possible.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.634
I am so blessed

21:07.668 --> 21:09.836
to have had somebody

21:09.870 --> 21:11.738
to fill my heart

21:11.772 --> 21:13.574
with such...

21:15.441 --> 21:17.010
...wonderful dreams

21:17.043 --> 21:20.647
and then to help me
to make them come true.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.652
[sighing]

21:29.455 --> 21:31.692
Yaya...

21:31.725 --> 21:33.660
...you don't
make things easy.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.933
I've been trying to do
what you told me to do.

21:39.966 --> 21:43.504
To go on with my life
as if nothing has happened.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.340
But... you don't understand

21:47.373 --> 21:49.042
how hard it is...

21:50.777 --> 21:54.648
...because you've
never lost you.

22:06.026 --> 22:08.562
I made this for you.

22:09.663 --> 22:11.598
[music continues]

22:20.406 --> 22:22.108
I hope you like it.

22:26.547 --> 22:28.849
Um...

22:28.882 --> 22:31.785
Cousin Larry said that...

22:31.818 --> 22:34.154
...I have to say goodbye.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.822
And that...

22:35.856 --> 22:38.491
And that,
I have to feel sad

22:38.525 --> 22:40.861
before I can feel happy again.

22:42.062 --> 22:44.965
And I think he was right.

22:47.100 --> 22:49.002
I miss you.

22:50.871 --> 22:52.606
[sighing]

22:55.475 --> 22:57.978
Well...

22:58.011 --> 23:01.047
...I'm gonna go
upstairs now and...

23:01.081 --> 23:03.684
...tell my friends
that I'm sad.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.622
I think that'll
make them happy.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.800
Bye‐bye, yaya.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.468
I see you again someday.

23:24.705 --> 23:26.640
[music continues]

23:42.723 --> 23:45.425
[theme music]

23:54.768 --> 23:57.704
[music continues]
