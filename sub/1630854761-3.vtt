WEBVTT

00:05.547 --> 00:08.049
- Where were you?
- I did time travel

00:08.049 --> 00:12.762
and I'm my mom's friend Alice,
but also... me Alice.

00:12.762 --> 00:15.432
Do you ever wonder
what happened to him?

00:15.432 --> 00:17.308
- Every day.

00:17.308 --> 00:20.395
You officially
declared Jacob dead?
- It was time.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.605
- I have to see Jacob.
- I understand.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.899
(laughing)

00:24.899 --> 00:27.235
- Come on, Jacob!

00:27.235 --> 00:30.572
***

00:37.203 --> 00:39.372
- Morning.
- Good morning.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.542
- What's your plan for today?
- Uh... you're looking at it.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.836
- You could try
looking for a job.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.380
- Just because I'm not writing
a book about Jacob

00:47.380 --> 00:49.382
does not mean
that I'm not gonna write.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.551
I mean, it's my passion.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.679
You know, I can make money here
as a writer.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.057
- All right, prove it.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.685
- Morning!
- Good morning.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.274
- Oh, wait. Here, try this.

01:07.192 --> 01:10.070
- Is that... mint?
- Yeah.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.738
Picked it fresh from the garden.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.032
Brings out the flavour
of the beans.
- Hmm.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.451
You're very... chipper.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.954
- She got up with the sun,
it'll put anyone in a good mood.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.414
- You got up early?

01:21.414 --> 01:23.166
On purpose? Why?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.876
- I don't know. It's just...

01:24.876 --> 01:26.753
there's something
about this place.

01:26.753 --> 01:30.548
Okay. Well, uh... I'm gonna go
hang out with Spencer and Zoey.

01:30.548 --> 01:31.758
- Good for you.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.301
- I didn't realize
you were friends.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.470
- Well, you were right.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.972
In time, I found my place here.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.267
Enjoy the beautiful day.

01:43.478 --> 01:47.065
- Okay, who replaced my daughter
with Rainbow Brite?
- Oh, come on!

01:47.065 --> 01:51.069
- What? Enjoy the beautiful day
without an eye roll?

01:51.069 --> 01:52.570
I don't know,
something is wrong.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.239
Is it a boy?

01:54.239 --> 01:56.616
Or drugs?
Are there drugs here now?

01:56.616 --> 01:58.493
- Why don't you trust
your daughter?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.954
- Yeah, it's a little difficult
after her disappearing act.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.997
She scared the hell out of me.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.125
- She's a teenager,
that's what they do.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.460
She's finding her place here.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.338
Maybe you should try
to do the same thing.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.091
(indistinct conversation)

02:15.927 --> 02:18.013
Oh.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.806
Hi, there.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.267
- Hi.
(chuckling)

02:22.267 --> 02:24.352
- Can I help you?

02:24.352 --> 02:27.897
- Word around town is
that you might be willing
to sell this boat.

02:27.897 --> 02:31.985
It's always been a dream of mine
to own one. It's perfect.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.238
I can fix her up.
- Can you believe it?

02:35.238 --> 02:37.866
Isn't she a beaut', Delly?

02:40.493 --> 02:42.120
(clears throat)
- Ma'am?

02:43.747 --> 02:45.957
- Oh. Um...

02:45.957 --> 02:48.376
I'm sorry. What did you say?

02:49.836 --> 02:52.088
- We want to make you an offer
on the boat.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.591
- Unless it's not for sale.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.593
- No.
(chuckling)

02:56.593 --> 02:58.470
No, it's...

02:58.470 --> 03:00.680
it's time to let her go.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.101
(chuckling)

03:05.101 --> 03:07.228
***

03:12.734 --> 03:14.652
(splashing, inhales)

03:23.161 --> 03:25.580
- That does not get easier.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.392
***

03:45.392 --> 03:48.770
(* There She Goes *
Sixpence None the Richer)

03:51.940 --> 03:53.858
(beeps)

04:01.157 --> 04:05.036
- You know it's been a dream
of mine. Think of all the great
memories she's gonna give us.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.622
- My opinion is a boat

04:07.622 --> 04:10.375
is just a hole in the water
that you throw money into.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.752
- Now, you sound
like your father.
- Hey, there!

04:13.878 --> 04:17.007
- Alice, we got a boat!
- Yeah, you sure did!

04:17.007 --> 04:18.925
- Hey, you're here!

04:18.925 --> 04:21.261
Come up or you're gonna miss it.
(chuckling)

04:24.305 --> 04:25.765
- Coming!

04:26.975 --> 04:29.894
- What am I missing?
- What are you wearing?

04:29.894 --> 04:33.314
- Uh... honestly,
I don't really know.
(chuckling)

04:33.314 --> 04:35.692
- Closet.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.445
- Folks, here we go, the song of
the summer, Britney Spears...

04:38.445 --> 04:41.031
- Wait, wait, wait,
hear this, hear this.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.991
(pop music)

04:42.991 --> 04:47.370
Thank God! I missed it
the last three times.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.497
- You're making a mixtape?

04:49.497 --> 04:51.583
That is so vintage.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.712
- Vintage? This has CD player
and a tape player.

04:55.712 --> 04:59.132
(* Baby One More Time *)

05:11.895 --> 05:14.064
It's my favourite.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.359
People say it's for kids,
but that caterpillar is deep.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.279
- "Who are you?"
Said the caterpillar.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.907
"I hardly know, sir,
at present.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.160
At least, I know who I was
when I got up this morning,

05:27.160 --> 05:30.163
but I think I must have changed
several times since then."

05:30.163 --> 05:32.624
The caterpillar replied,

05:32.624 --> 05:34.834
"You'll get used to it,
in time."

05:36.252 --> 05:38.963
- See? Deep.

05:38.963 --> 05:42.842
- Guys! I... I got it! Come on!

05:42.842 --> 05:44.844
(modem dialling)

05:45.970 --> 05:48.056
Listen to that.
Isn't it beautiful?

05:49.599 --> 05:52.519
Comes with this instant
messaging service thing

05:52.519 --> 05:54.813
that allows you to chat with
anyone, anywhere in the world,

05:54.813 --> 05:57.315
whenever you want.
Look, Monica's online.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.858
Isn't that amazing?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.527
- Why not just call her?

06:00.527 --> 06:02.362
- Ye of little vision.
Come on, Alice, you...

06:02.362 --> 06:04.239
there must be internet
where you come from, right?

06:04.239 --> 06:05.907
- Yeah. Yeah, the internet is
actually a really big deal

06:05.907 --> 06:08.910
where I come from.
- I knew it.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.162
- It must be an American thing.
(chuckling)

06:11.162 --> 06:13.623
- Hey, all hands on deck!
It's boat time!

06:13.623 --> 06:15.250
- Coming, Dad!

06:17.252 --> 06:19.963
- Oh, Alice, did you not get
the clothes I left you?

06:19.963 --> 06:23.091
- Clothes are a very loose term
for what you left me, Eliott.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.264
- Everyone's a critic.

06:31.016 --> 06:34.102
- That would be the new ending
of this version of the book.

06:34.102 --> 06:38.523
Uh... no. No, there'd be
no mention of Jacob
or his disappearance.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.816
(Jack): Okay, what's it about?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.860
- Well, um... like I said,

06:41.860 --> 06:47.115
it's about a city girl
moving back to life on the farm.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.368
Elevator pitch,
it's like Laura Ingalls Wilder

06:50.368 --> 06:53.538
but with cars! It... hello?

06:53.538 --> 06:55.665
Jack? Hello?

06:55.665 --> 06:57.625
- Everyone's a critic, right?

06:57.625 --> 07:00.086
- I'm so sorry
you had to witness that.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.672
Mom is still on me
about the whole

07:02.672 --> 07:05.175
"Landry women need to keep busy"
stuff and...

07:05.175 --> 07:07.469
she's not wrong.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.554
And I need a job,

07:09.554 --> 07:12.766
I just really want
to have something of my own,
here, you know?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.768
- Triple americano, extra hot.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.019
Again.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.271
- Yeah. Do you have
anything stronger?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.732
- No. I used to need alcohol
in tough days too.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.567
Now, I just do yoga.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.403
So much better
for your mental health.
- Hum.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.364
- The usual, El?

07:27.364 --> 07:28.907
- Yeah.
- Great.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.744
- I'm sorry, so... since when
did she start calling you El?

07:32.744 --> 07:34.371
That is my nickname for you.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.122
(chuckles)

07:36.122 --> 07:38.792
- You remember
back in high school,

07:38.792 --> 07:41.795
you were so determined to get
that internship at the Herald?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.047
You even camped
outside the office

07:44.047 --> 07:45.965
the night before
the applications were due?

07:45.965 --> 07:48.009
- Wait, what... okay,
so what are you saying?

07:48.009 --> 07:49.969
- I'm saying

07:49.969 --> 07:52.347
if you want something here
that's all yours,

07:52.347 --> 07:54.974
maybe try something
that already was.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.271
- Great work, guys.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.149
We'll show Del this beauty
can be seaworthy, uh?

08:03.149 --> 08:05.068
- Danny and I will be pirates!

08:05.068 --> 08:06.569
(chuckling)
- Pirates!

08:06.569 --> 08:09.864
- Who's Jacob's little buddy?
- Danny Sawyer.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.200
The two have basically
been inseparable since birth.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.204
- Here, kiddo,
let me give you a hand.
- Thanks.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.708
It's cool that you want
to fix this up.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.751
- Yeah? Well, good,

08:21.751 --> 08:24.838
because I'm going to need
your help convincing your mom.
(chuckling)

08:24.838 --> 08:28.091
In this together, right?
- Of course.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.386
- Hey! That thing's gonna take
more than a good scrubbing.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.930
Come on, now, sustenance.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.807
(laughing)

08:37.350 --> 08:39.477
(laughing)

08:39.477 --> 08:41.855
- I'm gonna share with you.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.024
- Hey, don't pick up flowers!

08:46.192 --> 08:48.278
- I was an intern here as a kid

08:48.278 --> 08:50.530
and coming back to work
at this paper

08:50.530 --> 08:52.657
has always been
a dream of mine,

08:52.657 --> 08:54.534
and I don't really like
to talk about it,

08:54.534 --> 08:56.327
but I am an award-winning
journalist

08:56.327 --> 08:59.539
and I have big ideas
for this paper.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.958
- Normally, we're a one-man
operation, here.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.960
But just to be clear,

09:03.960 --> 09:07.005
you're Delilah Landry's
daughter, right?

09:07.005 --> 09:09.924
- Oh, yes, yes, sorry.
Kat Landry.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.677
- Well, Kat Landry.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.429
You're hired.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.432
- Great!
(chuckling)

09:18.266 --> 09:20.018
- Last card.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.979
- I win.
- Really? Again?
(chuckling)

09:22.979 --> 09:26.608
- Why do you always
show up sometimes?

09:27.442 --> 09:30.862
- Well, my parents split up
and my mom lives here,

09:30.862 --> 09:33.990
but she has two jobs, so she's
just not around that much.

09:33.990 --> 09:38.286
- So, when she's gone,
you come here?
- Jake, stop!

09:38.286 --> 09:39.954
Mom?

09:39.954 --> 09:42.248
- Jacob, Alice can come over
whenever she wants.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.084
Honey, you are always welcome.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.920
Now, let's just enjoy
this sunset.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.256
- And imagine how nice
it would be on our boat.
(chuckling)

09:50.256 --> 09:53.551
- Yeah, you talk a good talk,
but truth walks,
more like a stroll.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.929
- Oh, no, not this time. No, no,

09:55.929 --> 09:58.765
when Kat gets back from camp,
we'll take her out
for her maiden voyage.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.142
- Why are boats always girls?

10:01.142 --> 10:04.062
- Oh, buddy, because
they're strong...

10:04.062 --> 10:06.064
and sturdy.

10:06.898 --> 10:10.318
And they keep saps
like me afloat.
(chuckling)

10:11.861 --> 10:13.822

10:16.324 --> 10:20.161
* Love your eyes
how they give me a reason *

10:20.161 --> 10:23.081
* How they change in the light *

10:24.958 --> 10:28.461

you're everything I want *

10:28.461 --> 10:31.423

10:35.593 --> 10:37.470
- Come on, now.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.306
- Um... I don't really play
anymore.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.684
- No one's gonna judge you here.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.687
Go ahead.
- Okay.
- All right?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.357
***

10:51.276 --> 10:54.988

in the light *

- It's a really pretty song.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.465
- I wrote it for this one.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.342
(chuckling)

11:15.342 --> 11:18.553
- That's enough strumming, now.
Come on, it's time for dinner.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.222
Come on.
(clapping hands)

11:21.222 --> 11:22.515
Let's go.
- All right.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.517
- Alice, you're staying, right?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.603
My mom made
her famous apple pie.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.731
- Sounds amazing, but
I really need to get going.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.569
I'll be back soon, though.
I promise.

11:38.281 --> 11:41.826
- Well, you should have seen it,
he just hired me
right there on the spot.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.664
Well... I'm waiting.

11:46.664 --> 11:50.210
Oh, come on! I was right,
why can't you just be happy
for me?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.962
- I'm happy for you!
I'm just curious.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.340
Byron never needed an employee
before.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.300
- Well, he had never met me.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.260
I mean, I am award winning.

12:00.679 --> 12:03.556
(sighs)
- She'll be here.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.226
- I really appreciate
your belief in her.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.687
I'm her mom,
so just let me worry.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.773
(door creaking)
- Hi, hi!

12:11.773 --> 12:13.983
- Oh, you made it.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.403
- And you're... damp?

12:16.403 --> 12:19.322
- Uh... yeah.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.866
I just... got caught
in a sun shower, you know,

12:21.866 --> 12:24.077
when it's sunny but then,
there's like one rain cloud.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.286
- Hmm...

12:26.621 --> 12:28.581
How was your day?

12:28.581 --> 12:31.042
- I actually got a job
at the paper.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.211
As a writer.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.464
- Nice! Congrats!
- Thank you.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.845
- Well, you both have
a job tomorrow:

12:41.845 --> 12:43.847
helping to clean out the boat
because I'm selling it.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.765
- Wait, what? Why?

12:45.765 --> 12:48.768
- Why not?

12:48.768 --> 12:51.730
- Because you shouldn't get rid
of something so special
to our family.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.273
- What do you know
about the boat?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.358
- Mom, why aren't you
more upset?

12:55.358 --> 12:58.403
You used to love that boat!
Don't you even care at all?

12:58.403 --> 13:01.364
- I do, but it's not my call,
Ali.

13:01.364 --> 13:05.410
- Or maybe no one
in this family cares anymore.
You used to, though.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.288
I just don't get why
no one seems to remember that!

13:09.873 --> 13:13.001
- Well, at least I know
my teenager's still in there.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.011
the pay off is that there's much
more engagement, generally.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.679
- I found the polaroid!

13:25.972 --> 13:28.725
- Science fair. Science fair.
The... chemical reaction.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.895
(chuckling)

13:31.895 --> 13:34.314
Could you please, please,
stop doing that?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.107
- Sorry, but it's important!

13:36.107 --> 13:38.401
I found a photo of mom and I
from back then.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.028
- Oh, that photo. Yeah.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.322
Your mom told me about it.
- You knew about that?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.949
I've been keeping this big time
travel secret this whole time
because you told...

13:44.949 --> 13:46.284
- Stop.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.662
It's blurry, right? The photo?
- Yeah.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.164
- So, you're gold.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.041
- You don't understand
where I found it.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.168
I found it in mom's old copy
of Alice in Wonderland.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.254
Alice... in Wonderland!
Do you think she figured it out?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.173
- I think she needed a bookmark.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.842
Don't worry.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.553
But maybe, from now on,
let's avoid being in any more
photos back then, uh?

14:05.553 --> 14:08.390
- Right. No more photos.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.308
- And keep an eye
on that polaroid.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.435
If you pull a Marty McFly
and it starts to disappear,

14:12.435 --> 14:14.479
then we have a problem.
(chuckling)

14:15.772 --> 14:17.524
Come on.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.401
Back to the future?

14:19.401 --> 14:21.486
- You're so old.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.783
- So, we got paper here, uh...

14:26.783 --> 14:30.578
coffee machine there,
archives at the back.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.331
And this is your desk.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.250
- Oh! That's...

14:35.250 --> 14:38.294
great, great.
Thank you. Thanks.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.423
- Books give you a
sense of privacy.

14:41.423 --> 14:44.426
- Um... so, I've been thinking
about my first article
that I wanted to write.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.803
- Okay.
- I could write

14:46.803 --> 14:49.347
a weekly column
about mothers and daughters...
- Mm-hmm.

14:49.347 --> 14:52.267
- Or an undercover piece about
the illegal fishing industry.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.060
- Actually,

14:54.060 --> 14:57.063
I already have the perfect
first assignment for you.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.440
- Great.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.860
- The town's biggest cucumber.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.741
- Another day down.
Need a ride home?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.868
- Hey, see you at the party
tonight, Spence.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.620
Hey, guys, wait up!
- Uh... no ride necessary.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.122
I'll see you later.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.707
- Wait, if you're not busy,

15:15.707 --> 15:17.584
it's my birthday.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.378
My mom went crazy and covered
the whole backyard in sixteens.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.340
I thought it was lame
until she promised
to clear off for tonight.

15:23.340 --> 15:27.385
- Happy birthday,
but I don't usually accept
last minute pity invites.

15:27.385 --> 15:31.514
- It's not! I just knew
you probably wouldn't want
to come.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.642
It's cool,
it's how it is with you.
- No, no... it isn't.

15:34.642 --> 15:38.521
I have somewhere I have to go
first, but then, I'll be there,
okay?

15:38.521 --> 15:41.149
- Okay.
I'm cautiously optimistic.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.037
- Okay. It's not great.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.249
- What?
My... my article, really?

15:58.249 --> 16:00.043
- Um...

16:00.043 --> 16:02.212
I may be the new guy,

16:02.212 --> 16:04.631
but I've been around the block
long enough to tell
that you didn't try.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.341
There's no passion in this,

16:06.341 --> 16:08.093
no attempt to understand
your subject.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.512
- Well, there's not much
to understand.

16:10.512 --> 16:13.473
It's a cucumber.
I'm sorry,

16:13.473 --> 16:16.768
but with all my years of work
and experience...
- And awards, right?

16:17.936 --> 16:20.021
- This piece...

16:20.021 --> 16:23.233
it's starting to feel
a little bit like a step back.

16:23.233 --> 16:26.361
- This paper is important,
Miss Landry.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.196
You might think it's a joke,

16:28.196 --> 16:30.657
but the people
in this community don't.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.035
I bet you used to care
about Port Haven
at one point in your life.

16:35.245 --> 16:38.039
- Of course.
- Then, show me.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.298
(inhales deeply)

17:00.812 --> 17:02.397
- Ew...

17:08.987 --> 17:10.071
- Elliot?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.241
How long have I been gone?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.415
- Yeah, you missed
the rest of the summer.

17:20.415 --> 17:23.043
Why did you wait so long
to come back?
- I didn't!

17:23.043 --> 17:25.086
It's only been one day
in present time.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.464
- Seriously?
- Yeah!

17:27.464 --> 17:31.634
- So, the pond has the ability
to send you forward
in massive leaps of time.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.928
- Oh, my God, Kat.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.598
How am I gonna explain this
to her?

17:36.598 --> 17:39.934
I have to go! I only have three
hours to fix all of this!
- Wait.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.485
The pond makes leaps forward.

17:48.485 --> 17:51.738
Does it make the choice?

17:51.738 --> 17:54.407
Send A where it wants.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.328
- And my mom was working
and I was with my dad
in the States

17:58.328 --> 17:59.788
and I couldn't come back
when I thought.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.456
I... I just...
I should have texted.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.249
- Texted?

18:03.249 --> 18:06.044
- I... mean, called.
I should have called.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.173
I'm so sorry.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.425
- I thought you would say
goodbye before I went to camp.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.679
I just...

18:15.679 --> 18:17.555
thought you didn't want
to hang out, anymore.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.891
- No, no, I...

18:19.891 --> 18:22.727
no, hanging out with you is
like the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.480
- I feel the same, honestly.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.069
It's okay. It's fine.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.530
Being divided between parents
must suck.

18:33.530 --> 18:37.909
Besides, I was at camp.
- Right.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.663
So, how was camp? Did you...

18:41.663 --> 18:45.166
meet anyone special or...
- Check this out.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.170
I wore a sticker for two weeks
to get it to turn out.
(chuckling)

18:49.170 --> 18:50.964
It's gonna be so perfect
for the party tonight.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.507
- What party?

18:53.591 --> 18:56.094
- The party.

18:56.094 --> 18:58.513
(rock music)

19:03.643 --> 19:06.229
And this is the cove.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.440
- A back to school bonfire...

19:08.440 --> 19:10.358
This is epic.
(chuckling)

19:10.358 --> 19:12.736
- Kat? I love that top.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.113
It was at The Gap like,
three years ago, right?

19:16.406 --> 19:20.577
- Alice, this is Monica,
captain of the fashion police.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.788
- Hey, you're the new girl
who moved here
and then went AWOL, right?

19:23.788 --> 19:26.291
- Um... yeah.
- Hey, Monica!

19:26.291 --> 19:30.670
(Monica): Hey! How are you guys!
I'm so glad you could make it!

19:34.591 --> 19:38.678
- What's up, Elliot? Kat.
- Hey.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.848
- Oh, um... Nick, this is Alice.
Alice, Nick.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.933
- Hey.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.643
- Hi.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.898
- Don't let the tortured artist
thing pull you,

19:49.898 --> 19:52.567
he still has
Power Rangers bed sheets.
(chuckling)

19:52.567 --> 19:55.403
- Okay, I think you need to work
on that introduction, Elliot.

20:05.121 --> 20:08.708
- Hey!
- Hi, Rita.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.670
- I have come to rescue you
from your toiling.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.380
I have brought dinner,
pot roast.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.674
- Well, you know, I...

20:15.674 --> 20:18.510
I really... I really need
to finish this.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.846
- Look what I brought. Maybe
this will change your mind.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.932
Vino!
(chuckling)

20:23.932 --> 20:26.851
- Okay. Twist my arm.
(laughing)

20:28.311 --> 20:31.564
(chuckling)
- Nobody does pot roast like me!

20:31.564 --> 20:34.818
- Modesty has always been
one of your best qualities.
(laughing)

20:34.818 --> 20:36.778
- Someone needs another drink.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.197
(knocking on door)
- Who is it?

20:39.197 --> 20:41.408
- It's Byron.
- Oh, hey! Come on in.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.910
- Hello.
- Hi.
(chuckling)

20:43.910 --> 20:46.371
- Oh, I didn't know
you had company.

20:46.371 --> 20:49.082
I stopped by
to drop these keys off.
- Okay.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.667
- For Kat, for the office.
- Okay.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.044
- But I forgot
to give them to her.
- Okay.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.714
- Whatever happened
to just leaving the key
under the old mat?

20:55.714 --> 20:58.591
- Why don't you join us?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.802
- No, I don't want to interrupt.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.263
- You wouldn't be,
and there's plenty of pot roast
to go around.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.598
(chuckling)
Have a seat, have a seat.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.404
- I lied before.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.908
I do have something stronger.

21:23.908 --> 21:26.327
- Oh, God, you're an angel.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.289
- Okay.

21:30.081 --> 21:32.584
Let's hear it. What's wrong?

21:32.584 --> 21:35.587
- Oh, no, it's... it's stupid.

21:35.587 --> 21:39.591
- Maybe, but Elliot...
can't be the only one
you talk to in this town.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.218
- 'Kay.

21:42.218 --> 21:45.221
- So, Del, talk to me
about the boat.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.598
Does cleaning mean selling?

21:46.598 --> 21:49.434
- Oh. Um...

21:49.434 --> 21:51.478
yes, it does.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.313
- Good.
Glad I made the connection.

21:53.313 --> 21:56.149
- Connection? What do you mean?

21:56.149 --> 22:00.236
- I was the one who told
those tourists about the boat.
- Why did you do that?

22:00.236 --> 22:03.365
- You've been hanging on
to that old thing for so long,
it was time to move on.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.284
- You... you need
to stay out of my business.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.203
When did you start thinking

22:08.203 --> 22:12.040
that you could tell me
what to do and when to do it?

22:12.040 --> 22:14.167
- So, wait, this is the thanks
that I get

22:14.167 --> 22:16.211
after decades of letting you
crying on my shoulder?

22:16.211 --> 22:17.504
- Rita, I don't think
that's helpful.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.339
- And you loved those decades,
didn't you?

22:19.339 --> 22:22.133
You want me to keep playing
the victim

22:22.133 --> 22:25.637
so that you have something to do
with your sorry little
lonely life.

22:25.637 --> 22:28.848
- Del Landry, how dare you?
- Ladies!

22:28.848 --> 22:31.226
- I am done
being your charity case.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.144
- Yeah, well, I'm done
being your punching bag.

22:33.144 --> 22:35.188
- Del, Rita, please,
can we just move...

22:35.188 --> 22:36.731
- Shut up, new guy!
- Shut ut, Byron!

22:38.566 --> 22:40.235
(sighs)

22:42.862 --> 22:45.740
- "Don't worry," she says,
via text.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.910
Like yeah, oh, no, it's totally
that simple, Alice.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.246
- Parenting is no joke.

22:51.246 --> 22:54.708
Why do you think I let Spencer
have the whole yard
for his party tonight?

22:54.708 --> 22:57.002
So I'd know where he is.

22:57.002 --> 22:59.671
Man, do you remember
what we were like
when we were teenagers?

22:59.671 --> 23:01.673
We were way crazier.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.258
(chuckling)
Oh, God.

23:03.258 --> 23:06.094
- The nights at the cove?
- Yeah.
(chuckling)

23:06.094 --> 23:08.596
Look, don't worry about Alice,
okay?

23:08.596 --> 23:10.015
She's safe at my house.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.599
And I know it's hard, but...

23:12.559 --> 23:14.936
she'll come around,
on her terms.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.734
- Listen, I... I'm sorry

23:20.734 --> 23:23.111
that I acted like
I was above this town.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.572
I am not.
I'm just...

23:25.572 --> 23:28.241
I don't know,
a little confused, I guess.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.368
- I'm sorry...

23:30.368 --> 23:34.372
for talking about doing yoga
like I have it all together,
it's just...

23:36.207 --> 23:38.209
sometimes, I feel...

23:38.209 --> 23:40.879
a little intimidated by you.

23:40.879 --> 23:43.340
- Me?
(chuckling)

23:43.340 --> 23:46.676
Well, I hope this little
meltdown has helped
change that for you.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.720
(chuckling)
- A little bit.
- A little bit, yeah.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.682
- Hey, Monica, I know
you're almost closed,
but can I get a coffee?

23:52.682 --> 23:54.476
- Of course, Andy.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.978
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.149
(phone ringing)

24:03.318 --> 24:05.278
(Andy): Hey.

24:05.278 --> 24:08.198
- Okay, maybe you can spend
a little less time focussed
on Alice

24:08.198 --> 24:10.658
and more time focussed on you.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.328
- What? What are you saying?

24:15.455 --> 24:17.957
- Thanks.
You two have a good night.

24:21.503 --> 24:25.924
- What I'm saying is
you are now single,

24:25.924 --> 24:28.927
you started dating Bradon back
in what, high school?
So, that makes...

24:30.178 --> 24:32.389
wait.
- What?

24:32.389 --> 24:35.934
- Is he the only guy
you've ever been with?

24:35.934 --> 24:38.436
- Okay, look, you're really not
that experienced either, right?

24:38.436 --> 24:41.398
You married Trevor Spillsky.

24:41.398 --> 24:44.943
This is a guy that you mocked
all through high school.
- True.

24:45.819 --> 24:48.613
What can I say? Cheers.

24:48.613 --> 24:51.366
To teenage love.

24:51.366 --> 24:54.536
- Oh, my gosh,
Spillsky is the worst.
(chuckling)

24:54.536 --> 24:57.247
- Teenage boys are so immature.
(chuckling)

24:57.247 --> 25:01.543
- Music can say things
that words can't, so...

25:01.543 --> 25:04.379
I guess that's why
I'm learning to play.

25:04.379 --> 25:07.590
- Yeah.
- Have you heard
the Californication album?

25:07.590 --> 25:11.344
I swear that album is gonna
go down in history.

25:11.344 --> 25:14.639
What the Chili Peppers can do
is so inspiring.

25:15.932 --> 25:19.269
I want to make people feel the
way those songs make me feel.

25:19.269 --> 25:20.645
- Totally.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.274
- So, why did you start playing?

25:24.274 --> 25:27.235
- Well, it kind of runs
in the family.

25:27.235 --> 25:30.822
I have my granddad's guitar
and lately,

25:30.822 --> 25:33.366
I've been learning more
about him

25:33.366 --> 25:35.368
and it just makes playing
more special.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.287
- Man!

25:37.287 --> 25:40.040
My answer was so lame
compared to yours.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.583
- No!
(chuckling)

25:41.583 --> 25:43.918
You're inspired, it's...
it's not lame.

25:45.420 --> 25:48.089
So, are you gonna play something
or what?

25:48.089 --> 25:49.632
- Uh...

25:49.632 --> 25:52.594
no, I... I'm really not good.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.095
- Come on.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.930
No one is gonna judge you here.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.768
- All right.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.728
(sighs)

26:01.728 --> 26:04.022
Let's see.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.566
One, two, three, four.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.693
(guitar music)

26:13.740 --> 26:16.951
(Elliot sighs)
(false notes)

26:20.163 --> 26:21.956
(laughing)

26:21.956 --> 26:24.209
Okay, so maybe
a little bit of judgment.

26:24.209 --> 26:26.211
- No!
(laughing)

26:26.211 --> 26:29.339
- Maybe just put the guitar down
for all our sakes.
(chuckling)

26:29.339 --> 26:31.466
- Oh! Such supportive friends!
(chuckling)

26:31.466 --> 26:33.635
- Alice, you should play.

26:33.635 --> 26:36.429
- Uh... no, no, I...

26:36.429 --> 26:38.431
I don't even know
what I would play.

26:38.431 --> 26:40.475
- No one is gonna judge you
here.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.102
- Okay.

26:52.112 --> 26:54.489
(guitar music)

26:58.034 --> 27:02.288
* My loneliness is killing me *

27:03.415 --> 27:08.712
* I must confess I still believe
still believe *

27:08.712 --> 27:12.507
* When I'm not with you
I lose my mind *

27:12.507 --> 27:15.010
* Give me a sign *

27:16.761 --> 27:20.432
* Hit me baby one more time **

27:22.017 --> 27:24.811
(cheers)
(laughing)
- Go, Alice!

27:24.811 --> 27:26.938
(beeping)

27:27.981 --> 27:29.733
- What's the alarm for?

27:30.692 --> 27:32.819
Got another party to get to
or something?

27:32.819 --> 27:34.821
- Uh... no, no.
(chuckling)

27:34.821 --> 27:37.115
Uh... I just... I really need
to get going, so...

27:37.115 --> 27:39.534
- Wait, really?
(police sirens)

27:39.534 --> 27:41.244
- Crap! The cops!

27:41.244 --> 27:45.331
Get away! Go!

27:45.331 --> 27:47.292
- I can't go to jail here,
Elliot!

27:47.292 --> 27:49.794
- Look, we can get you
to the pond, okay?
- Hey, come with me.

27:49.794 --> 27:52.630
- Come on, El! Let's go!

27:56.509 --> 27:58.678
- Hang on and trust me.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.388
Oh, just hang on, Del.
Oh, it's quite a gale,

28:00.388 --> 28:02.140
the waves are splashing!
They're splashing!

28:02.140 --> 28:04.309
Oh, and the boat's rocking!

28:04.309 --> 28:06.811
- Oh, this is ridiculous.
- No, but we got to get you used
to this thing

28:06.811 --> 28:08.980
if we're gonna take it out.

28:08.980 --> 28:11.483
And it's rocking and rolling
and the waves...
- Just take it out without me.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.276
(sigh)
- Delly.

28:13.276 --> 28:16.112
Delly, the thing is, Delly,

28:16.112 --> 28:19.366
I don't want to go anywhere
without you.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.634
- How often does this happen?

28:37.634 --> 28:41.179
- Let's just say Port Haven's
finest doesn't see much action.

28:41.179 --> 28:42.514
(chuckling)

28:42.514 --> 28:44.683
Oh! What's that? Teenagers?

28:44.683 --> 28:47.060
On a beach? Oh! With a bonfire?

28:47.060 --> 28:49.604
What horrors will ensue?
(chuckling)

28:50.939 --> 28:53.066
Oh, uh... here.

29:03.410 --> 29:06.913
- Well, thanks for sharing
your hiding spot with me.

29:06.913 --> 29:10.458
- Hey, it's way more fun hiding
behind this rock with you.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.800
I... really want to kiss you,
right now.

29:27.392 --> 29:29.519
- Sorry, I... was that okay?
(chuckling)

29:29.519 --> 29:31.896
- Yeah, that was...
- Are you sure? It was okay?

29:31.896 --> 29:34.399
- ...very okay...
amazingly okay.

29:34.399 --> 29:37.318
- Okay.
(chuckling)
Good. Good.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.823
- Was... that like
your first kiss or something?

29:41.823 --> 29:44.200
- Uh... what? No.
(chuckling)

29:44.200 --> 29:46.453
I've had plenty of others.
(chuckling)
- Okay.

29:46.453 --> 29:50.999
Well, then,
how many does this make?

29:57.130 --> 30:01.968
- Well, there was that one
and the one before that

30:01.968 --> 30:05.430
and so, it makes... uh... two?

30:05.430 --> 30:08.183
- Where the heck
did you come from?

30:09.601 --> 30:12.103
- There you guys are!

30:12.103 --> 30:15.857
Together?
- Yeah, safe and sound.

30:15.857 --> 30:19.319
- Well, the coast is clear
and the party is totally over,

30:19.319 --> 30:22.947
but Alice,
you should sleep over, tonight.

30:22.947 --> 30:25.992
We have a lot to talk about.
- Yeah, sounds good.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.953
- Uh... shouldn't you be going?
- It's fine.

30:28.953 --> 30:31.414
- Great! We'll go
to the club house.

30:31.414 --> 30:32.665
- Okay.
- Bye.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.334
- What are you doing?

30:34.334 --> 30:36.211
- Relax, my mom thinks
I'm at a birthday party.

30:36.211 --> 30:38.380
- Alice, I...
- I'm doing it, okay?

30:38.380 --> 30:40.674
What if next time, the pond
sends me back months

30:40.674 --> 30:42.509
or even years away
from this moment?

30:42.509 --> 30:45.178
I can't risk it, I'm staying.

30:45.178 --> 30:48.181
There's no place I'd rather be.
- Oh.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.482
- So, what's with you and Nick?

30:57.482 --> 31:00.193
(chuckling)
You two seemed cozy, tonight.

31:00.193 --> 31:03.363
- Well, one minute
we were sitting there

31:03.363 --> 31:05.365
and then, the next minute,
we were kissing.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.951
(chuckling)
- I knew it! How is he?

31:07.951 --> 31:11.913
- He was... soft, but firm.

31:11.913 --> 31:15.583
- Amazing. The perfect combo.
(chuckling)

31:15.583 --> 31:18.378
- I've never had a boyfriend.
Is he my boyfriend?

31:18.378 --> 31:22.048
Should I ask?
- Okay, slow down.
Just... enjoy it.

31:23.466 --> 31:27.137
At least, that's what
I'm doing with my boyfriend.

31:27.137 --> 31:29.514
- Boyfriend?
- Um-um.

31:29.514 --> 31:33.351
- Tell me about him!
- Well, I met him at camp.

31:33.351 --> 31:37.731
His name is Bradon,
but I call him Brady.

31:38.773 --> 31:41.317
- Brady?
- He's...

31:41.317 --> 31:44.404
sweet, thoughtful...

31:45.739 --> 31:48.324
...so selfless,

31:48.324 --> 31:50.702
and... he makes me laugh.

31:50.702 --> 31:53.872
(chuckling)
He's so funny.

31:53.872 --> 31:56.416
- Yeah... I mean,
I guess he can be.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.918
I mean, I bet he is.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.546
- But I haven't told my parents
yet.

32:01.546 --> 32:02.881
- Why not?

32:03.798 --> 32:06.551
- It's... it's silly, but...

32:06.551 --> 32:10.138
I don't want to have
to share him with anyone, yet.

32:10.138 --> 32:12.682
Well... I guess with anyone
but you, now.

32:12.682 --> 32:14.601
(chuckling)

32:14.601 --> 32:16.686
Plus...

32:16.686 --> 32:19.773
he's rich
and he lives in the city.

32:19.773 --> 32:21.775
And well...

32:23.151 --> 32:25.320
...my parents don't.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.614
Mom especially might not get it.

32:27.614 --> 32:29.616
- I bet she will.

32:31.409 --> 32:34.537
Then again, my mom doesn't trust
anything that I do.

32:34.537 --> 32:36.706
- She sounds brutal.

32:38.833 --> 32:41.044
- She's actually not so bad.

32:42.962 --> 32:45.757
- Brady is the first secret
I've ever kept from my parents.

32:46.716 --> 32:48.802
Have you ever kept
any big secrets?

32:52.222 --> 32:54.557
- Actually, there is one.

33:11.199 --> 33:13.326
I can time travel.

33:17.163 --> 33:20.458
(laughing)

33:20.458 --> 33:23.211
- Oh, my God! You're so funny.

33:23.211 --> 33:25.296
(laughing)

33:25.296 --> 33:27.173
- Yeah, I'm so funny.

33:27.173 --> 33:30.176
- Okay. Well, good night.

33:30.176 --> 33:33.138
Wake me if you time travel.
(chuckling)

33:33.138 --> 33:35.306
***

33:43.857 --> 33:45.859
- Uh...

33:59.664 --> 34:01.624
- Hot tip,

34:01.624 --> 34:04.586
avoid the school's chicken.

34:04.586 --> 34:06.046
(knocking on door)

34:11.509 --> 34:13.178
Come in!

34:15.555 --> 34:17.974
- Hey. You're up?

34:19.517 --> 34:21.478
How was Spencer's party?

34:21.478 --> 34:23.480
- It was... it was good, yeah.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.398
I met some nice people.

34:25.398 --> 34:28.068
- Good, good.
Um...

34:29.652 --> 34:32.364
Well, I wanted to... apologize,

34:32.364 --> 34:35.367
because I've been really
out of sorts lately.

34:35.367 --> 34:37.327
I guess I'm just still

34:37.327 --> 34:41.831
struggling to figure out
where I fit in here, you know?

34:41.831 --> 34:43.917
- Yeah, I... definitely
get that.

34:43.917 --> 34:45.794
- Really?

34:45.794 --> 34:48.838
Because you are...
you are doing it so well.

34:48.838 --> 34:51.966
I am really proud of you,
Ali.

34:51.966 --> 34:57.180
And I know that you think
that I've clipped your wings,

34:57.180 --> 35:00.517
but I'm gonna start
giving you what you deserve,

35:00.517 --> 35:04.104
which is trust and freedom.

35:04.896 --> 35:07.273
- Oh. Thanks.

35:08.566 --> 35:10.026
- Yeah.

35:22.997 --> 35:26.001
- Well, the boat's all cleaned
up, no thanks to either of you,

35:26.001 --> 35:27.877
and the buyer is coming
to pick her up today.

35:27.877 --> 35:29.379
- But I... I thought
we were keeping it.

35:29.379 --> 35:31.506
- You thought that, not me.

35:31.506 --> 35:33.883
- We could just fix it up
and then, we could go out
on the ocean

35:33.883 --> 35:35.885
like you and Colton
used to do.

35:35.885 --> 35:37.721
- What did you say?

35:37.721 --> 35:39.764
- You just need
to keep the boat!

35:39.764 --> 35:42.726
- You really shouldn't talk
about things
you don't understand.

36:03.038 --> 36:04.330
- I can't find him.

36:05.123 --> 36:06.958
He's gone!

36:06.958 --> 36:08.668
(panting)

36:09.753 --> 36:11.838
- Permission to come aboard?

36:14.591 --> 36:16.134
You know...

36:17.177 --> 36:19.763
Alice doesn't know that
we never took this thing out.

36:20.972 --> 36:23.016
- I know.

36:23.016 --> 36:27.145
- You don't have
to sell the boat, Mom.

36:27.145 --> 36:29.898
You don't have to erase
every reminder

36:29.898 --> 36:31.524
of what life was like before...
(deep breath)

36:31.524 --> 36:33.401
...what happened.

36:33.401 --> 36:36.363
Turning your back on the past,
it doesn't make you strong,

36:36.363 --> 36:38.365
it makes you lonely.

36:39.366 --> 36:41.034
(sighs)

36:42.952 --> 36:44.454
- You're a good mom,

36:44.454 --> 36:46.831
you know that girl,

36:46.831 --> 36:49.709
better than
I gave you credit for.

36:53.380 --> 36:55.131
Trust yourself.

37:00.011 --> 37:01.763
- So...

37:01.763 --> 37:03.556
when were you gonna tell me

37:03.556 --> 37:05.558
that the pond can send me
ahead in time?

37:05.558 --> 37:08.144
- How about,
"Hi, mister Augustine"?

37:08.144 --> 37:10.980
- Come on. We ran from the cops
together, don't hold out on me.

37:10.980 --> 37:13.692
- Fine. I didn't tell you
because I know how confusing
your life becomes

37:13.692 --> 37:16.111
when someone tells you
your future.

37:16.111 --> 37:18.738
- Are you saying that...
I did that to you?

37:19.698 --> 37:21.658
- Don't worry.

37:21.658 --> 37:23.368
And the jumps
didn't always happen.

37:23.368 --> 37:24.786
Sometimes, they were
back-to-back.

37:24.786 --> 37:26.454
If I remember right,

37:26.454 --> 37:29.082
the one after we almost
got arrested was the next day.

37:29.082 --> 37:31.876
- Okay, good. I was...
I was really freaking out.

37:31.876 --> 37:33.753
And...

37:33.753 --> 37:36.339
I'm sorry if what I told you
about your future

37:36.339 --> 37:37.882
really messed up your life.

37:37.882 --> 37:40.010
- You didn't mess up my life,

37:40.010 --> 37:41.928
but you will if you don't stop
talking about us
almost getting arrested

37:41.928 --> 37:43.638
while on school property.

37:43.638 --> 37:46.599
(chuckling)
- Won't happen again,
mister Augustine.

37:53.857 --> 37:56.526
- Okay...
- So...

37:56.526 --> 37:58.945
how did it all go?
- Good, I think.

37:58.945 --> 38:01.990
I mean, I trusted her,
I apologized,

38:01.990 --> 38:04.534
all the greatest hits.
- Nice.

38:04.534 --> 38:07.120
- Andy! The usual?
- Yes, please.

38:12.208 --> 38:16.129
Hi. I'm Andy.
You must be new here.

38:16.129 --> 38:18.757
- I'm, uh... Kat.

38:18.757 --> 38:20.050
- Kat.

38:23.887 --> 38:26.765
Yeah, I can't be sure, but I...

38:26.765 --> 38:29.059
something tells me Monica wants
you to give me your number.

38:29.059 --> 38:31.311
- Yeah, she's super subtle
like that, yeah.

38:31.311 --> 38:33.104
- Seems like a good idea to me.

38:33.980 --> 38:35.315
- Okay.

38:37.901 --> 38:39.986
- There you go.
- Thank you.

38:45.367 --> 38:47.827
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

38:50.789 --> 38:52.791
- Very nice.
- Oh, my God!

38:52.791 --> 38:54.834
- Ah! Hey, birthday boy!
Come, come.

38:56.169 --> 38:58.088
- Happy birthday.

38:58.088 --> 39:00.715
And... thank you for inviting
Alice to your party.

39:00.715 --> 39:02.592
- Sure. Too bad
she couldn't make it.

39:02.592 --> 39:06.179
- Uh... yeah. That's... too bad.

39:08.807 --> 39:10.517
(sigh)

39:16.439 --> 39:20.110
(humming
* Baby One More Time *)

39:27.909 --> 39:30.745
- I'm gonna meet up
with Spencer and Zoey,
we're gonna catch a movie.

39:30.745 --> 39:33.039
- Yeah, sounds good.

39:33.039 --> 39:37.002
- By the way, I'm...
not selling the boat.

39:37.002 --> 39:38.878
- Seriously?

39:38.878 --> 39:41.423
That... that's great!
Thank you so much!

39:41.423 --> 39:44.884
- But I'm not having
that eyesore in my yard.
You need to fix it up.

39:44.884 --> 39:46.553
- Yeah, yeah. We'll fix it.

39:46.553 --> 39:48.513
I promise.

39:48.513 --> 39:50.765
- Oh, okay, okay.
(chuckling)

39:50.765 --> 39:52.642
- She'll be out on the ocean
soon.

39:55.645 --> 39:57.147
(sighs)

39:58.314 --> 40:01.317
- Um... yeah, I'm gonna...

40:01.317 --> 40:05.655
I'm gonna head out too, but
thank you for keeping the boat.

40:05.655 --> 40:07.991
- Don't make a big deal
out of it.

40:18.001 --> 40:20.712
(Kat's voice): When mister
Sullivan first planted
the cucumber seeds

40:20.712 --> 40:22.881
in that particular
patch of dirt,

40:22.881 --> 40:25.133
he didn't have any expectations,

40:25.133 --> 40:28.094
but that's the thing
about the soil here
in Port Haven,

40:28.094 --> 40:29.721
it can surprise you.

40:31.056 --> 40:33.558
He never gave up and finally,

40:33.558 --> 40:38.313
they grew bigger and wilder
than ever expected.

40:38.313 --> 40:41.858
Mister Sullivan would say
the key was learning
from past mistakes,

40:41.858 --> 40:46.363
but I think
it was something else, trust."

40:55.205 --> 40:57.874
(eerie music)

41:07.050 --> 41:08.760
Alice?

41:11.805 --> 41:13.765
(eerie music)

41:14.891 --> 41:16.726
Alice?

41:18.478 --> 41:20.021
Alice!

41:21.564 --> 41:23.358
Alice!

41:40.166 --> 41:42.585
Subtitling: difuze
