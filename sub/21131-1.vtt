[Natalia whispering]
<i>Can you hear the silence?</i>

00:20.320 --> 00:22.256
[in normal voice]
<i>If something was to happen,</i>

00:22.322 --> 00:26.460
<i>I know that I've had no regrets</i>
<i>in my life whatsoever.</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:29.596
[Lizanne] <i>Life is fragile,</i>

00:29.663 --> 00:33.767
<i>and there's a real sense</i>
<i>of helplessness.</i>

00:36.503 --> 00:39.673
[Emma] <i>I've not got anything left to give.</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:43.043
[Laura] <i>I just...</i>

00:43.577 --> 00:45.445
<i>really want to get home.</i>

01:33.794 --> 01:36.330
[man 1] <i>The vast Pacific Ocean</i>
<i>is a formidable force.</i>

01:36.396 --> 01:37.664
<i>In the history of humans,</i>

01:38.332 --> 01:40.267
<i>only very few have been able to cross it.</i>

01:40.334 --> 01:43.503
[woman 1] <i>The man and his partner</i>
<i>were pulled from heavy seas 11 days ago.</i>

01:43.570 --> 01:46.707
[woman 2] <i>Six-meter swell</i>
<i>struck the rowers' boat, rolling it.</i>

01:47.374 --> 01:49.409
[man 2] <i>Two women rowers spent 16 hours</i>

01:49.476 --> 01:52.112
<i>clinging to the hull of their boat</i>
<i>in the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

01:52.179 --> 01:54.481
[woman 3]
<i>This was their second failed attempt.</i>

01:57.417 --> 02:01.588
[man 3] <i>Now a dramatic rescue at sea.</i>
<i>A giant wave caught them by surprise,</i>

02:01.655 --> 02:03.890
<i>instantly flipping the boat over.</i>

02:04.157 --> 02:06.259
[woman 4] <i>She had to cling on for her life</i>

02:06.326 --> 02:09.562
<i>as the boat capsized</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

02:09.630 --> 02:13.233
[woman 5] <i>The whole trip very nearly ended</i>
<i>in tragedy.</i>

02:21.575 --> 02:24.311
[woman 1] <i>Now, to the story of four women</i>
<i>who are about to embark</i>

02:24.378 --> 02:25.646
<i>on an incredible challenge.</i>

02:25.712 --> 02:28.715
[man 1] <i>The first all-woman crew</i>
<i>to row more than 8000 miles</i>

02:28.782 --> 02:30.450
<i>across the world's largest ocean.</i>

02:30.517 --> 02:33.920
[woman 2] <i>An amazing journey rowing</i>
<i>across the Pacific Ocean.</i>

02:34.187 --> 02:37.624
[man 2] <i>From California in the U.S.</i>
<i>to Cairns in Australia...</i>

02:37.691 --> 02:40.293
[man 3] <i> Two will row</i>
<i>as two sleep below deck,</i>

02:40.360 --> 02:43.664
<i>two hours on, two hours off,</i>
<i>24 hours a day.</i>

02:43.730 --> 02:45.832
<i>There will be no support boat</i>
<i>in the Pacific.</i>

02:45.899 --> 02:48.301
<i>They reckon it will take</i>
<i>six and a half months.</i>

02:48.368 --> 02:51.204
[woman 3] <i>So, why would four women</i>
<i>take on this dangerous task,</i>

02:51.271 --> 02:54.708
<i>arguably the hardest ocean crossing</i>
<i>in the world?</i>

03:13.560 --> 03:14.428
Laura?

03:15.262 --> 03:15.929
[Laura] Thank you!

03:16.196 --> 03:19.232
<i>My name's Laura Penhaul,</i>
<i>and I'm part of the Coxless Crew.</i>

03:19.699 --> 03:22.836
It's really bizarre to be here 'cause this
is three and a half years in the making.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.309
<i>We're doing a team selection.</i>
<i>Trying to select the right crew</i>

03:29.376 --> 03:31.344
and looking at different personalities.

03:31.411 --> 03:34.748
<i>We are focusing a lot at the moment</i>
<i>on our physical training,</i>

03:34.815 --> 03:38.852
<i>but I would say 80 percent of it</i>
<i>is going to be our mental strength.</i>

03:38.919 --> 03:41.588
It's a massive expedition.
It's one thing thinking it.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.724
It's whether you actually go through
with it.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.959
<i>It's been a long road to the start line.</i>

03:46.793 --> 03:50.630
<i>In October 2012, we chose</i>
<i>to represent Breast Cancer Care</i>

03:50.697 --> 03:54.267
<i>and I decided to use all of my savings</i>
<i>to begin construction on </i> Doris.

03:55.268 --> 03:56.970
<i>A year and a half into the project,</i>

03:57.237 --> 03:59.306
<i>Cambridge rower Emma Mitchell</i>
<i>joined the team.</i>

03:59.673 --> 04:02.642
<i>There was a lot of hard work</i>
<i>securing sponsorships that we needed.</i>

04:03.510 --> 04:06.413
<i>We did a final recruitment in May of 2014,</i>

04:06.480 --> 04:08.682
<i>and this is where we met Izzy, Natalia,</i>

04:08.749 --> 04:11.718
<i>as well as our two reserve rowers,</i>
<i>Lizanne and Meg.</i>

04:13.320 --> 04:16.490
<i>We've trained extensively,</i>
<i>both mentally and physically,</i>

04:16.555 --> 04:19.559
<i>to make sure we are best prepared</i>
<i>for anything that we face.</i>

04:19.959 --> 04:21.695
<i>At the end of the day,</i>
<i>this is unsupported.</i>

04:21.762 --> 04:23.964
<i>We've got to roll with the punches.</i>
<i>That's part of the expedition.</i>

04:24.030 --> 04:26.666
To me, if you've then got
somebody following you along,

04:26.733 --> 04:28.468
it's too easy to have an option

04:28.535 --> 04:31.271
to jump out and go,
"We'll just jump on that bigger ship

04:31.338 --> 04:33.340
because that's going to be
a bit more comfortable,"

04:33.406 --> 04:36.376
rather than riding out the storm
and doing what we've set out to do.

04:39.312 --> 04:42.449
<i>When people have second-guessed it</i>
<i>or not believed in it,</i>

04:42.516 --> 04:44.918
<i>it's only driven me more</i>
<i>to want to make it happen.</i>

04:44.985 --> 04:46.920
She didn't want to look back
in ten years' time

04:46.987 --> 04:48.588
and say "I wish I'd done that."

04:49.022 --> 04:51.024
<i>She just said, "We're gonna do it."</i>

04:52.359 --> 04:54.961
I need to fit everything
in that cabin first.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.496
Then we can go.

04:56.563 --> 04:59.633
I think at the moment, being
on the oars in <i>Doris</i> is my happy place.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.536
I'll see if that's still the case
by the time we get to Australia.

05:03.003 --> 05:06.873
[Sara] <i>When Emma got involved in rowing,</i>
<i>she must have been 12, 13 years old.</i>

05:06.940 --> 05:09.309
She stopped everything for rowing.

05:09.376 --> 05:13.313
It was fairly phenomenal
what an impact rowing had on her.

05:13.380 --> 05:18.952
<i>It was like this focus, this drive,</i>
<i>that gave her strength and character.</i>

05:19.019 --> 05:19.886
And she loved it.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.721
<i>I mean, she was out</i>
<i>at 5:00 in the morning.</i>

05:21.788 --> 05:24.691
<i>She would be blue with the cold</i>
<i>when she'd come back.</i>

05:28.995 --> 05:33.033
It could be a midlife crisis, but it would
be an impressive midlife crisis to have.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.635
"What did you do?"
"Well, I rowed across the Pacific."

05:35.702 --> 05:36.703
So, here we are.

05:36.770 --> 05:40.540
We're going to see Natalia
getting her ECG done.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.409
Hey, Nat!

05:42.842 --> 05:45.712
<i>She's lived an amazing life of 15 years</i>

05:45.779 --> 05:48.048
<i>of going from place to place</i>
<i>and only doing the things</i>

05:48.114 --> 05:50.083
<i>that she truly loves and adores.</i>

05:50.350 --> 05:52.619
<i>It's crazy.</i>
<i>I've never known and I'm sure</i>

05:52.686 --> 05:54.654
<i>I will never meet anybody like it again.</i>

05:55.789 --> 05:57.991
I'm not going to say I want her
to be married and have children,

05:58.058 --> 05:59.459
because I really don't care.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.561
<i>If that's not her life,</i>
<i>that's not her life.</i>

06:01.628 --> 06:04.397
<i>She must just be fulfilled</i>
<i>in whatever she does.</i>

06:05.398 --> 06:07.033
[Natalia] <i>All of my past experiences</i>

06:07.100 --> 06:09.402
have actually been so instrumental

06:09.469 --> 06:10.937
<i>into getting me here.</i>

06:12.839 --> 06:14.541
It just feels really strange.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.978
And it feels slightly
like just a training row, as well.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.012
But...

06:19.546 --> 06:21.114
I'm sure it will be real soon enough.

06:21.848 --> 06:26.052
[Jean] <i>Isabel has climbed</i>
<i>to over-6000-meter peaks in the Himalayas,</i>

06:26.119 --> 06:29.389
<i>and when she heard about this,</i>
<i>she saw it</i>

06:29.456 --> 06:32.626
as a really serious challenge
and she wanted to pursue it.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.833
[Isabel] <i>I like to not stick out,</i>
<i>and I like to take the ordinary course.</i>

06:39.899 --> 06:42.068
It's quite hard to actually stop
and say, "You know what?

06:42.135 --> 06:44.471
I think I want to do something
massively different."

06:46.139 --> 06:47.707
<i>The main reason</i>

06:47.774 --> 06:49.843
<i>is to test myself</i>

06:49.909 --> 06:52.012
and just to see what I'm capable of.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.080
[speaking indistinctly]

06:59.552 --> 07:03.957
So, if you can imagine the wind is coming
from that direction, from over there.

07:04.024 --> 07:04.891
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.628
You would put the para anchor in
on that corner. Yeah.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.430
[Emma] <i>Tony is our shore support.</i>

07:10.497 --> 07:12.032
<i>He will be in touch with us</i>

07:12.098 --> 07:14.501
on a daily basis
whilst we're out in the ocean.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.437
[Tony] Make sure
it's really done up tight.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.006
<i>I hear the girls are going</i>
<i>to break lots of records.</i>

07:20.073 --> 07:21.841
The girls aren't going
to break any records.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.978
They're going to establish records
because this has never been done before.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.782
<i>The fact that it hasn't been done before</i>
<i>is testament to how tough it is.</i>

07:30.450 --> 07:33.486
[Emma] <i>We're rowing</i>
<i>from San Francisco to Hawaii.</i>

07:33.553 --> 07:35.622
<i>Have a few days to restock the boat.</i>

07:36.056 --> 07:38.558
<i>And then we row</i>
<i>between Hawaii and Samoa.</i>

07:40.894 --> 07:44.064
<i>And then the final leg is from Samoa</i>
<i>over to Cairns in Australia.</i>

07:45.065 --> 07:47.867
<i>The whole journey in total is 8446 miles.</i>

07:50.470 --> 07:52.973
[Laura] <i>What I loved about this route</i>
<i>in particular</i>

07:53.039 --> 07:54.808
<i>is there's never been a male team either.</i>

07:54.874 --> 07:59.145
This is the first fours boat ever to cross
the Pacific Ocean, north or south.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.686
[Jean] <i> I've had moments that I found it</i>

08:06.753 --> 08:09.789
absolutely devastating,
the idea that she's doing it.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.091
Aw...

08:14.060 --> 08:15.929
[Sara] <i>I'm her Mom.</i>
<i>She's still my little girl.</i>

08:15.996 --> 08:18.565
She's about to go out
onto that huge ocean,

08:18.631 --> 08:20.867
<i>and a bit of me is terrified.</i>

08:22.802 --> 08:25.972
Quite a strange sense of calm.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.942
Let's hope it's not the calm
before the storm.

08:30.577 --> 08:31.845
See you later!

08:33.212 --> 08:34.514
Adieu!

08:35.948 --> 08:37.951
Mwah. Love you!

08:39.251 --> 08:40.953
We're about to row the Pacific!

08:41.020 --> 08:42.222
[all laughing]

08:46.092 --> 08:48.795
[Emma] This is so surreal. [laughs]

08:49.195 --> 08:50.597
[Laura] So surreal.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.198
Three cheers for <i>Doris!</i>

08:52.265 --> 08:54.134
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-[all] Hooray!

08:54.200 --> 08:56.603
-Hip, hip, hooray!
-Hooray!

08:56.669 --> 08:58.104
Hip, hip, hooray!

09:17.090 --> 09:18.324
[Natalia] <i>So, this is it.</i>

09:19.092 --> 09:20.827
<i>The journey has begun.</i>

09:21.761 --> 09:23.930
This is really happening.

09:43.349 --> 09:46.619
<i>We're starting to get our routines</i>
<i>a little bit slicker,</i>

09:46.686 --> 09:50.690
<i>getting on and off the oars,</i>
<i>which is good.</i>

09:50.757 --> 09:52.692
<i>This is going to be</i>
<i>a period of adjustment.</i>

09:55.228 --> 09:58.998
Ah, hello. We just got off the oars,

09:59.065 --> 10:03.136
and about an hour ago
we saw a whale in the distance.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.305
Oh, my God!

10:05.371 --> 10:07.173
Jesus, he's huge!

10:07.240 --> 10:09.375
[Emma] <i>Neither of us had ever seen</i>
<i>a whale before.</i>

10:10.310 --> 10:12.846
He just poked his blowhole out.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.815
Whoa!

10:17.050 --> 10:19.953
One came and
fully breached out of the water.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.254
[all shout]

10:22.689 --> 10:24.390
[Natalia] <i>I was fairly petrified,</i>
<i>to be honest.</i>

10:24.657 --> 10:26.259
Petrified-stroke-fascinated.

10:26.326 --> 10:29.896
<i>It was the strangest feeling</i>
<i>I've ever had.</i>

10:31.131 --> 10:33.800
I'd love to capture that feeling
and put it in a bottle.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.069
<i>I've never felt so alive.</i>

10:36.870 --> 10:38.238
Oh, my God!

10:38.905 --> 10:42.108
There's not many things
where I feel adrenaline like that.

10:42.942 --> 10:43.977
<i>Day one.</i>

10:44.043 --> 10:47.080
Hundred and fifty-four days to go.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.839
-It's 1:30 in the morning.
-It is indeed.

11:13.306 --> 11:18.945
And we've just done our, um,
first fully dark night shift.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.448
So, we're going to snooze until 3:00?

11:22.715 --> 11:23.783
-Yep.
-And then...

11:23.850 --> 11:26.252
And then we're back on the oars
at quarter past 3.

11:28.421 --> 11:32.191
[Emma] <i>Life on </i> Doris
<i>is beautifully simple.</i>

11:32.258 --> 11:35.929
<i>All you have to do is sit on the oars</i>
<i>and row for two hours,</i>

11:35.995 --> 11:38.398
<i>and then you have your two hours</i>
<i>where you're either eating</i>

11:38.464 --> 11:40.099
<i>or sleeping or doing the jobs</i>

11:40.166 --> 11:42.101
<i>and stuff that you need</i>
<i>to do on the boat.</i>

11:44.237 --> 11:48.107
[Laura] Doris <i> is our pink 29-foot</i>
<i>ocean rowing boat.</i>

11:48.174 --> 11:50.443
<i>There's two cabins, one at each end.</i>

11:50.710 --> 11:54.280
<i>The cabins are about the size</i>
<i>of a fairly small two-man tent.</i>

11:54.347 --> 11:56.349
<i>We've got solar panels</i>
<i>along the top of the boat,</i>

11:56.416 --> 11:58.051
<i>and they're connected to our batteries,</i>

11:58.117 --> 12:01.754
<i>which are underneath the bit</i>
<i>that we sleep on in the cabin.</i>

12:02.722 --> 12:05.725
If we drain those batteries,
we've got no way of using our GPS

12:05.792 --> 12:09.028
<i>or making water</i>
<i>and stuff off the electrics.</i>

12:09.095 --> 12:11.998
<i>So, we need to be really careful</i>
<i>and calculated about that.</i>

12:12.465 --> 12:13.333
<i>I tell you what.</i>

12:13.399 --> 12:16.836
Spend 48 hours sitting
in your own bathtub at home

12:16.903 --> 12:19.138
<i>and imagine you've got a lid over it,</i>

12:19.205 --> 12:20.974
<i>so, you can't quite sit up straight.</i>

12:21.040 --> 12:24.444
<i>That's pretty much what it's like</i>
<i>in the forecabin.</i>

12:25.778 --> 12:27.747
[Isabel] <i>It is breakfast time.</i>

12:27.814 --> 12:29.749
Emma is going to tell you
what we have today.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.417
On today's menu,

12:32.018 --> 12:35.488
for Miss Isabel Burnham
we have some beef shepherd's pie.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.324
This is our cooker.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.794
Our little jet boil,
so, we have to boil up some water.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.964
We should probably run
the water maker, as well, Ems.

12:45.031 --> 12:45.932
Yeah.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.402
We've got enough food to give each of us
about 5000 calories every day.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.839
And the bulk of those calories
come from our expedition foods,

12:52.905 --> 12:54.941
<i>which are freeze-dried ration packs.</i>

12:56.776 --> 12:59.545
There we go, then we just leave it
for a little while to rehydrate,

12:59.812 --> 13:01.147
and then... hot food.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.515
Thanks, Ems!

13:24.904 --> 13:26.272
Night shifts are the worst

13:26.339 --> 13:27.840
<i>because you just wake up,</i>

13:27.907 --> 13:31.878
<i>you've got to get back into your cold,</i>
<i>wet, soggy wet-weather gear,</i>

13:31.944 --> 13:35.915
<i>wet socks, wet shoes, and you've gotta</i>
<i>get out of the warm sleeping bag</i>

13:35.982 --> 13:38.384
<i>and then not fall asleep</i>
<i>if you're some of us.</i>

13:42.288 --> 13:44.290
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

13:44.357 --> 13:48.428
is the ritual that happens
every two hours, without fail.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.607
[Emma] <i>This is a week we've been at sea.</i>

14:01.874 --> 14:03.509
It's a beautiful sunny day,

14:03.576 --> 14:06.112
and it would be really lovely
except for that fact

14:06.879 --> 14:10.616
that there is a lot of wind
and a lot of very big waves,

14:10.883 --> 14:12.251
which are quite scary.

14:12.318 --> 14:15.221
<i>Every time you go on the oars,</i>
<i>you get completely soaked.</i>

14:18.558 --> 14:22.228
Little bit of a frustrating day today,
to be honest.

14:22.295 --> 14:27.200
<i>The wind is pushing us back</i>
<i>towards the coastline.</i>

14:27.266 --> 14:30.436
<i>And the wind is due</i>
<i>to pick up again this evening.</i>

14:31.537 --> 14:32.939
[Laura] <i>The size of these waves</i>

14:33.005 --> 14:35.942
are slightly scaring me a little bit.
They're pretty massive!

14:36.409 --> 14:38.878
<i>Today they seem to have gotten</i>
<i>a hell of a lot bigger.</i>

14:39.645 --> 14:42.348
One minute you're looking up
at a three-, four-story house,

14:42.415 --> 14:44.584
and then the next minute
you're on top of the Pacific.

14:44.650 --> 14:45.585
<i>They're huge.</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:50.957
<i>The wind's just too strong.</i>

14:51.023 --> 14:54.060
It's about 25 to 28 knots.

14:54.127 --> 14:59.365
<i>We basically have to sit tight here</i>
<i>for the next pretty much 48 hours.</i>

15:00.066 --> 15:01.367
We want to be out there rowing

15:01.434 --> 15:04.170
and we want to be rowing
in the right direction.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.410
[speaking indistinctly]

15:11.644 --> 15:12.645
[Emma] <i>Tad bit of a drama.</i>

15:12.912 --> 15:15.415
We went to go and check on the batteries.

15:15.481 --> 15:20.052
I pulled the cushions back,
and the whole hatch was full of water.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.989
We lost the MPPT box, which is basically

15:23.055 --> 15:26.426
<i>the bit of equipment that connects</i>
<i>the solar panels and the batteries.</i>

15:27.360 --> 15:29.262
Thing is, we're now coming into nighttime.

15:29.328 --> 15:33.299
At the moment, we're not emitting
any signal, which is a bit of a concern,

15:33.366 --> 15:35.034
whether boats...

15:35.601 --> 15:37.136
Well, they won't see us, basically.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.605
<i>So, we've checked the other hatches,</i>
<i>and actually,</i>

15:39.672 --> 15:42.108
<i>there's a load of water</i>
<i>in a load of other hatches.</i>

15:45.178 --> 15:47.246
[Natalia] <i> Our decision was made</i>
<i>for us, really.</i>

15:47.313 --> 15:49.982
<i>We're going to have to go back to land.</i>

15:52.018 --> 15:53.453
Very depressing.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.656
Very frustrating. Um...

15:56.722 --> 15:58.624
But there's nothing
we can do about it.

15:58.691 --> 16:02.061
<i>Right now we're actually heading</i>
<i>for Santa Barbara.</i>

16:07.033 --> 16:08.067
Yeah.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.436
It's not a great start to an ocean row,
that's for sure.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.539
Anyhoo...

16:30.389 --> 16:32.391
[Laura] <i>Being out here</i>
<i>has made me question why...</i>

16:33.059 --> 16:34.594
Why are we out here?
Why are we doing this?

16:34.660 --> 16:38.764
Why did I persevere for four years to make
sure this project got off the ground?

16:39.031 --> 16:40.032
And not...

16:40.099 --> 16:42.335
Not just because I know
that I'm bloody stubborn.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.740
<i>The story of why we're here</i>
<i>and why we're doing it for breast cancer.</i>

16:48.608 --> 16:52.278
Patricia was the most beautiful woman,
and she was in the perfect place.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.748
<i>Patricia was the person</i>
<i>that would walk into a room</i>

16:56.015 --> 16:59.018
<i>and everybody would be drawn to her.</i>
<i>She's just lovely.</i>

16:59.485 --> 17:02.655
<i>It was actually her husband, Rashid,</i>
<i>that I know very well.</i>

17:02.722 --> 17:06.058
<i>They had just been on their honeymoon</i>
<i>and she fell pregnant.</i>

17:06.125 --> 17:08.761
<i>And they were just in that perfect bubble.</i>

17:10.630 --> 17:13.432
<i>And then, unfortunately,</i>
<i>two months into her pregnancy,</i>

17:13.499 --> 17:15.334
she found a lump.

17:17.303 --> 17:20.106
<i>He was hugely premature,</i>
<i>but he survived it, little Yassin.</i>

17:20.172 --> 17:21.473
<i>He's gorgeous.</i>

17:24.477 --> 17:26.412
<i>She just drew on this strength</i>

17:26.479 --> 17:30.082
<i>and resilience that Rashid talks about</i>
<i>which is just unbelievable.</i>

17:30.750 --> 17:31.751
[Patricia] Do we have to?

17:32.585 --> 17:33.653
[babbles]

17:33.719 --> 17:35.588
Yeah, we've got to.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.557
And we've got to.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.559
[Laura] <i>I saw her within that period,</i>

17:39.625 --> 17:42.361
and she was experiencing a lot
of neck pain and back pain,

17:42.428 --> 17:44.564
<i>so, we sent her back to her oncologist,</i>

17:44.630 --> 17:47.466
<i>and that's when they found</i>
<i>that she had secondaries.</i>

17:47.533 --> 17:49.235
[Rashid] Give Mama a kissy.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.603
Give Mama a kissy. Come on.

17:56.108 --> 17:59.779
I took each day for granted,
and don't do that.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.080
Just get on with life.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.615
[Rashid] What happens
if things get difficult?

18:02.682 --> 18:05.618
You just keep going
and you keep going and you keep going.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.324
[Laura] <i>It was within about two months</i>
<i>after that that she passed away.</i>

18:22.568 --> 18:25.471
<i>I guess out here it makes you realize</i>
<i>all of those sorts of things.</i>

18:25.538 --> 18:27.406
<i>Simple things like love</i>

18:27.473 --> 18:29.675
<i>and having friends</i>
<i>and family around you</i>

18:29.742 --> 18:31.110
<i>that are just amazing.</i>

18:31.644 --> 18:32.678
<i>I guess the point is</i>

18:32.745 --> 18:35.448
life's too short
and you really do have to live it.

18:35.514 --> 18:38.651
Um... We really, really believe in that,

18:38.718 --> 18:41.520
and that's why we're here and that's
why we're doing what we're doing.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.658
<i>Patricia wouldn't have given up at all.</i>

18:45.725 --> 18:49.495
<i>She was fighting for her life, so,</i>
<i>we can fight to get across to Australia.</i>

19:02.908 --> 19:05.845
Seamanship is about making
the right decisions at the right times,

19:05.911 --> 19:07.413
<i>and that's what they've done.</i>

19:10.149 --> 19:11.917
You want to undo
that bowline for us, Nat?

19:20.860 --> 19:21.861
<i>They are now actually</i>

19:21.927 --> 19:25.564
further away from Honolulu than they were
when they started out in San Francisco.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.800
<i>Also, they've come further south now,</i>

19:27.867 --> 19:31.871
<i>so, they've lost the advantage of going</i>
<i>west from a more northerly position.</i>

19:31.937 --> 19:33.939
<i>So, in all honesty, it's likely</i>

19:34.206 --> 19:36.442
to be a longer row starting out
from Santa Barbara

19:36.509 --> 19:39.278
than it was starting out
from San Francisco.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.347
[speaking indistinctly]

19:42.181 --> 19:44.550
[Natalia] <i>What we've just done</i>
<i>was a perfect insight</i>

19:44.617 --> 19:47.286
<i>into the hardships that are going to come.</i>

19:47.353 --> 19:48.654
<i>It's going to be a long journey,</i>

19:49.321 --> 19:51.257
but it's going to be an amazing one.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.764
[all laughing]

20:18.217 --> 20:21.220
[Emma] Nat looks very happy
to be back outside on the oars.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.355
Try as we might,

20:23.422 --> 20:26.292
we are still only just about going west.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.327
But it is better than southeast.

20:36.001 --> 20:39.605
<i>We haven't seen the sunshine,</i>
<i>the stars or the moon for about a week.</i>

20:39.672 --> 20:41.774
We're hoping that at some point soon

20:41.841 --> 20:44.310
the weather starts
to get a little bit better.

20:48.547 --> 20:52.318
[Laura] <i>We've got both wind</i>
<i>and current now against us.</i>

20:52.818 --> 20:54.687
This is fine.
It's just part of the challenges.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.690
[groans]

21:10.536 --> 21:12.772
[Laura] <i>We just ticked off 300 miles!</i>

21:13.405 --> 21:14.840
So, like totally nearly there.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.309
Only like 2000 to go and that's Hawaii.

21:17.376 --> 21:18.410
[both chuckling]

21:18.477 --> 21:19.979
We'll be there in a couple of days!

21:20.045 --> 21:21.280
Oh, dear.

21:29.021 --> 21:32.291
[Laura] <i>It's Emma's birthday today.</i>
<i>She's 30!</i>

21:32.758 --> 21:35.327
And it's actually been a blue-sky day,
which is great.

21:35.394 --> 21:38.664
So, um, we've just set up some balloons.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.499
[laughing]

21:40.566 --> 21:42.334
[all] ♪ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♪

21:42.735 --> 21:45.905
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you</i> ♪

21:45.971 --> 21:49.675
Emma's amazing. She is very different

21:49.742 --> 21:53.979
to anyone that I would ordinarily
be friends with

21:54.046 --> 21:56.782
<i>because she's very quiet</i>

21:56.849 --> 21:58.684
<i>and very introverted</i>

21:58.751 --> 22:01.954
<i>and isn't incredibly emotional</i>
<i>or expressive.</i>

22:03.055 --> 22:05.024
<i>She's just really steady,</i>

22:05.624 --> 22:09.428
and I think I'm gonna value that hugely
on the boat.

22:11.697 --> 22:14.600
You can tell with Emma
she just loves rowing.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.903
<i>She's just so happy as soon</i>
<i>as she gets onto the oars.</i>

22:18.704 --> 22:20.973
[Emma] <i> It's one of those sports</i>
<i>that when you start it</i>

22:21.040 --> 22:25.444
you kind of get hooked because it's more
than just the actual exercise bit.

22:25.511 --> 22:29.348
It's such a community
and such a team activity.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.851
[Laura] Here's a little something
from all of us.

22:33.485 --> 22:36.789
It's a little oar with a little message
on the back.

22:37.856 --> 22:42.061
[Laura] <i>Ems leaves her heart and soul</i>
<i>on those oars every time.</i>

22:42.728 --> 22:46.398
She's gonna be one of the rocks
in the boat that keeps us all together.

22:55.841 --> 22:57.409
[Emma] <i>Good morning!</i>

22:57.476 --> 22:58.877
<i>We're now heading on a bearing</i>

22:58.944 --> 23:01.413
to Hawaii again, which is quite exciting,

23:01.480 --> 23:03.782
and hopefully,
we'll pick up a bit of speed.

23:04.850 --> 23:08.087
We're making progress,
very slowly, but making progress

23:08.153 --> 23:09.622
because we are moving west.

23:09.688 --> 23:12.658
<i>And we've slipped into this pattern,</i>
<i>really.</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:17.429
<i>To be honest, for me</i>
<i>it's become quite a monotonous pattern.</i>

23:17.496 --> 23:20.466
<i>The shifts move very, very quickly,</i>

23:20.532 --> 23:21.967
<i>on the oars, off the oars.</i>

23:22.034 --> 23:26.005
<i>Daytime into nighttime,</i>
<i>nighttime into daytime.</i>

23:26.071 --> 23:29.541
<i>Rowing, resting, rowing, resting.</i>

23:32.878 --> 23:36.081
[Laura] <i> I think the overall effect</i>
<i>of living life</i>

23:36.148 --> 23:39.952
<i>in two-hourly chunks is that</i>
<i>you're so focused on each two hours</i>

23:40.019 --> 23:41.954
<i>that you just don't notice</i>
<i>where the time's gone.</i>

23:42.021 --> 23:43.589
[Natalia] <i>The biggest surprise for me</i>

23:43.656 --> 23:49.061
<i>is actually how quickly we adapt</i>
<i>as human beings, physically and mentally,</i>

23:49.128 --> 23:51.730
<i>to a situation</i>
<i>that we've put ourselves in.</i>

24:01.840 --> 24:03.742
My main concern right now

24:03.809 --> 24:07.046
is that we have a weather window
when we look at the full picture

24:07.112 --> 24:08.514
for getting to Cairns.

24:08.580 --> 24:09.948
<i>The longer we take on this leg,</i>

24:10.015 --> 24:12.584
<i>the less time we have</i>
<i>to do the other legs,</i>

24:12.651 --> 24:14.086
<i>and it has a knock-on effect.</i>

24:34.640 --> 24:35.808
[both shout]

24:35.874 --> 24:36.809
It's chilly!

24:43.582 --> 24:44.650
[woman laughs]

24:52.925 --> 24:55.027
[Natalia whispering]
<i>Can you hear the silence?</i>

24:57.062 --> 24:59.898
It's ridiculous.
You never just hear nothing out here.

24:59.965 --> 25:02.701
We're in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,

25:02.768 --> 25:04.536
and there's not a sound.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.608
Missing home a bit today. Just thinking...

25:10.609 --> 25:12.878
that we missed out on quite a lot,

25:12.945 --> 25:15.280
um, while we've been out here.

25:15.547 --> 25:16.281
But, um...

25:16.949 --> 25:19.218
then again, you're sort of... out here

25:19.284 --> 25:22.755
on a night like this
or an afternoon like today in the sunshine

25:22.821 --> 25:25.924
and think that you'd rather be doing this
than anything else.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.968
I have big concerns
about the amount of stress

25:36.034 --> 25:37.936
that I'll be putting my family under.

25:38.604 --> 25:42.040
<i>I think they felt it was</i>
<i>an unnecessary risk to take</i>

25:42.107 --> 25:45.010
because they didn't understand
the motivation.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.613
If you don't understand
why someone would want to do it,

25:47.679 --> 25:51.884
then of course it seems
like an unnecessary and crazy thing to do.

25:53.318 --> 25:55.854
[Jean] <i>I have very,</i>
<i>very supportive friends,</i>

25:55.921 --> 25:59.191
<i>but they have no comprehension</i>
<i>of how difficult it is,</i>

25:59.258 --> 26:01.193
because their children have not decided

26:01.260 --> 26:03.829
that they're going to do something
quite so extreme.

26:05.697 --> 26:07.699
[Tony] <i>When you asked me</i>
<i>would I ever row an ocean,</i>

26:07.766 --> 26:11.203
the reason I say no is because
I know how tough it is to row an ocean

26:11.270 --> 26:13.806
and I know how much
you've got to want to do it.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.576
[Isabel] <i>When I started,</i>
<i>I knew it would be a big project,</i>

26:17.643 --> 26:20.612
but I didn't realize how, how big.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.715
<i>Before we left San Francisco,</i>

26:23.782 --> 26:26.685
<i>I made the difficult decision</i>
<i>to only row one leg.</i>

26:27.686 --> 26:30.756
<i>As much as I desperately wanted</i>
<i>to row the whole way,</i>

26:30.823 --> 26:31.857
<i>the only thing</i>

26:31.924 --> 26:36.161
that's more important than what
I really want to do is my family.

27:05.891 --> 27:07.159
Very lovely.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.727
Let's resume.

27:15.834 --> 27:18.203
Rowing. We don't do enough of this.

27:19.004 --> 27:21.373
We only do 12 hours of this every day.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.009
We've only done 1200 miles so far.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.143
Yeah, not a lot.

27:26.912 --> 27:30.249
<i>Within the first three minutes</i>
<i>speaking to Laura,</i>

27:30.315 --> 27:34.152
I just knew
that we had a very similar value system.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.824
[Laura] <i>I've always wanted</i>
<i>to sort of have an impact</i>

27:38.891 --> 27:42.294
and make sure that in my life
I've kind of achieved things

27:42.361 --> 27:43.862
that have made a difference.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.700
<i>I've always loved doing sport.</i>

27:48.767 --> 27:50.903
As a kid I would either be doing
cross-country running

27:50.969 --> 27:52.671
<i>and playing hockey or netball.</i>

27:53.238 --> 27:56.275
<i>Even at the age of 12,</i>
<i>I knew I wanted to be a physio.</i>

27:56.341 --> 27:58.810
<i>And now I'm 32, I am a physio.</i>

27:58.877 --> 28:01.880
<i>But I think when I was about 8,</i>
<i>I would watch the Olympics</i>

28:01.947 --> 28:03.215
<i>and said to my mom and dad:</i>

28:03.282 --> 28:06.218
<i>"You know, one day I'd love</i>
<i>to be at the Olympics,"</i>

28:06.285 --> 28:08.320
<i>not realizing in what capacity.</i>

28:09.021 --> 28:11.690
<i>Now I've been to two Paralympics</i>

28:11.757 --> 28:13.792
<i>and we've got Rio when I finish the row.</i>

28:14.860 --> 28:16.328
My work is part of my identity.

28:16.395 --> 28:17.963
It's what I live for.

28:18.030 --> 28:22.401
<i>To me, being involved in Rio</i>
<i>is kind of the pinnacle of my career.</i>

28:22.467 --> 28:26.405
<i>But I think sometimes you've really</i>
<i>got to go with your gut, when you know...</i>

28:26.471 --> 28:29.841
There's certain opportunities that come up
you just know you have to take.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.411
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her.

28:32.477 --> 28:35.781
<i>I think we'd follow her</i>
<i>wherever she wanted to take us, really.</i>

28:48.293 --> 28:50.062
[man over radio] <i>Yes, </i> Doris,<i> go ahead.</i>

28:50.929 --> 28:54.299
Yeah, we can see you
approaching us at the moment.

28:54.366 --> 28:59.504
If you can keep a bit of a safe distance.
We have pretty much no maneuverability.

29:00.806 --> 29:02.774
[man] <i>We won't hit you,</i>
<i>don't worry about that.</i>

29:02.841 --> 29:04.042
-[foghorn blowing]
-[Emma laughs]

29:04.109 --> 29:07.946
Yeah, we're on, uh, day 57
since we left Santa Barbara.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.184
-[man] <i>That's a long slog.</i>
-[laughs]

29:12.251 --> 29:14.886
[man] <i>Weather forecast, have you seen it?</i>

29:14.953 --> 29:16.455
<i>You're gonna get bounced around.</i>

29:17.389 --> 29:18.290
<i>You'll feel it.</i>

29:19.024 --> 29:20.525
[thunder rumbling]

29:27.399 --> 29:28.800
[Natalia] <i>Day 59.</i>

29:28.867 --> 29:30.802
<i>Tropical Storm Ella.</i>

29:31.470 --> 29:33.905
Lots of waves coming over.

29:33.972 --> 29:35.841
<i>Uh, heavy wind.</i>

29:37.042 --> 29:41.913
The wind has picked up again, and we
were getting blown really far south.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.218
There's big swells. Um...

29:46.285 --> 29:49.254
We're on the edge of a tropical rainstorm,
and there's a lot going on.

29:52.357 --> 29:54.126
Really windy out there.

29:54.192 --> 29:58.363
We're fighting against the wind
and the current as well at the moment.

30:07.839 --> 30:10.509
Feel a little bit like you're getting hit
by a bus, to be honest.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.357
<i>The only thing I could think about</i>
<i>for the whole session was:</i>

30:25.424 --> 30:26.992
<i>"You've gotta row, you've gotta row."</i>

30:27.059 --> 30:30.862
<i>I was almost having to convince myself</i>
<i>every single stroke to just not stop.</i>

30:36.201 --> 30:40.038
[Natalia] We're rowing
like we've never rowed before.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.592
Look, Nat!

31:01.360 --> 31:03.295
Land ahoy, baby!

31:03.362 --> 31:04.329
[woman laughs]

31:05.263 --> 31:07.899
Whoo!

31:07.966 --> 31:09.968
[whooping]

31:14.172 --> 31:15.640
[whistling]

31:15.907 --> 31:17.075
[inaudible dialogue]

31:22.914 --> 31:23.582
[Laura] <i>Here we are.</i>

31:23.648 --> 31:26.485
About one mile to go.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.920
Less, 0.2 miles to the entrance.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.123
[Natalia] We're nearly there.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.126
We're so nearly there.

31:40.332 --> 31:44.436
Me and the ladies are bringing her home!

31:45.470 --> 31:47.472
[crowd cheering]

31:50.575 --> 31:52.210
[man] Way to go, girls!

32:28.213 --> 32:29.714
[chattering]

32:38.256 --> 32:43.662
<i>Coming back to land</i>
<i>and eating fresh, hydrated food</i>

32:43.728 --> 32:45.397
was absolutely incredible.

32:45.464 --> 32:49.501
<i>I think as well as the taste sensation,</i>

32:49.568 --> 32:53.472
<i>it's also the colors, the array of colors</i>
<i>that you get in real food</i>

32:53.538 --> 32:56.107
that you just don't get
in dehydrated food.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.212
This whole meal is heaven.

33:01.046 --> 33:03.381
[Lizanne] This is the one plus
about rowing an ocean:

33:03.448 --> 33:07.719
you can eat brownies for days.

33:10.489 --> 33:14.059
<i>My name is Lizanne van Vurren,</i>
<i>and I was born in South Africa.</i>

33:14.125 --> 33:16.294
I wasn't the typical, I guess,

33:16.361 --> 33:18.597
girl who played inside with dolls all day.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.465
<i>I was a bit of a tomboy.</i>

33:22.267 --> 33:25.537
<i>I messaged Laura and I said,</i>
<i>"What you're doing is amazing."</i>

33:25.604 --> 33:29.241
So, she messaged me back and said,
"Well, why you don't join me?"

33:29.307 --> 33:31.776
<i>"I don't row. I don't live in England.</i>

33:32.043 --> 33:34.246
<i>You must be joking." And she said:</i>

33:34.312 --> 33:36.014
"None of that matters."

33:36.081 --> 33:38.683
<i>So, I was held as a reserve</i>

33:38.750 --> 33:41.019
<i>and then Laura called me and said:</i>

33:41.086 --> 33:42.787
"Can you still do it?"

33:43.054 --> 33:45.390
And I was like, "Okay!"

33:45.457 --> 33:46.525
And that was it.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.563
<i>I'll be rowing to Samoa,</i>

33:51.630 --> 33:57.602
<i>and then Megan Dyos will take over</i>
<i>from me and go to Cairns.</i>

33:58.270 --> 34:01.540
It's just something so far
from what I've ever done before

34:01.606 --> 34:03.241
or even thought possible.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.612
[Laura] <i> Girls,</i>
<i>thanks for making this happen.</i>

34:07.679 --> 34:11.815
For finally being an amazing team.
I'm so proud of all of you.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.717
And of Meg, who's not here.

34:13.784 --> 34:16.221
But cheers,
and thanks for the first leg, Izzy.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.489
We've adored you,
and we're going to miss you massively.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.391
[all] Cheers!

34:21.525 --> 34:22.694
Cheers, ladies.

34:33.138 --> 34:36.274
I don't think I realized how
such different reasons

34:36.341 --> 34:38.409
would bring four people
to do the same thing.

34:39.476 --> 34:41.346
<i>My part of the journey has come to an end.</i>

34:41.413 --> 34:43.681
<i>I couldn't have asked</i>
<i>for any more from my experience.</i>

35:12.243 --> 35:15.146
[Tony] <i> California to Hawaii was in theory</i>
<i>going to be the easy leg.</i>

35:15.213 --> 35:17.115
<i>Leg two is a tough one, really.</i>

35:17.182 --> 35:20.452
Leaving from here,
they've got to row more or less due south.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.688
[Laura] <i>It's supposed to take</i>
<i>about 60 days, but just who knows?</i>

35:23.755 --> 35:26.124
<i>The problem is, this year, is El Niño,</i>

35:26.191 --> 35:28.760
<i>and we hadn't factored in actually</i>
<i>how much of an effect that's had</i>

35:28.827 --> 35:31.563
on the trade winds
just 'cause there isn't any trade winds,

35:31.630 --> 35:34.132
so, there's no assistance,
and a lot of ocean rowing

35:34.199 --> 35:36.468
is about assistance with the wind.

35:37.402 --> 35:38.637
I mean, God!

35:40.205 --> 35:41.806
Yeah, it's all getting real now.

36:13.705 --> 36:18.376
<i>It feels like I'm in a completely</i>
<i>different world. I can't explain it.</i>

36:18.910 --> 36:22.380
It's just like we've been taken
from our day-to-day life

36:22.447 --> 36:24.616
and just inserted in the ocean,

36:24.683 --> 36:26.818
<i>and all you have to do is row.</i>

36:30.822 --> 36:32.524
Oh, my God.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.732
[Laura] <i> Lizanne and I</i>
<i>just stuck our heads in</i>

36:40.799 --> 36:44.402
to, um, see the fishies
up close and personal.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.339
Here she comes.
She's got the old fishing hook.

36:50.275 --> 36:53.745
-So...
-Has it got an instruction manual?

36:53.812 --> 36:54.946
[chuckles]

36:55.580 --> 36:59.451
I'm not really one for an instruction
manual anyway, so, that's all right.

36:59.517 --> 37:03.488
But maybe if we find it in the book
and it's edible, we can...

37:04.622 --> 37:06.624
We can cut it open and eat it.

37:07.258 --> 37:09.260
[laughing]

37:09.327 --> 37:10.662
-Would you?
-Yeah, too right.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.297
-Okay.
-Give it a go.

37:12.731 --> 37:13.865
Not... Yeah.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.501
Maybe. [chuckles]

37:17.268 --> 37:20.271
<i>I really connect with Lizanne.</i>
<i>She's just a breath of fresh air.</i>

37:21.873 --> 37:25.677
[Natalia] <i>It's just been a really</i>
<i>different energy to have on the boat,</i>

37:25.744 --> 37:28.379
<i>which I think for the three of us</i>
<i>doing the full journey</i>

37:28.446 --> 37:29.647
<i>is really important.</i>

37:32.717 --> 37:33.718
Whoo!

37:40.425 --> 37:42.894
[Natalia] <i>It's Saturday, which means...</i>

37:43.728 --> 37:45.797
[both] it's Lipstick Saturday!

37:47.699 --> 37:49.434
[chuckles]

37:49.501 --> 37:51.770
We just had a really, really lovely shift.

37:51.836 --> 37:53.571
<i>We saw a beautiful little turtle!</i>

37:53.638 --> 37:54.973
[Lizanne] <i>Yeah, on its own.</i>

37:55.039 --> 37:57.509
<i>Just bobbing along next to us.</i>

37:57.909 --> 38:00.745
<i>There's something about being out here</i>

38:00.812 --> 38:05.416
and there's no noise,
like just nothing apart from us.

38:05.483 --> 38:06.417
It's amazing.

38:06.484 --> 38:09.888
Don't even have, like, an engine
to ruin that for us.

38:12.757 --> 38:15.326
Is it me or does it feel
like we're standing still?

38:17.328 --> 38:19.998
<i>I now realize why people love rowing.</i>

38:20.064 --> 38:22.433
<i>It is so soothing.</i>

38:41.052 --> 38:43.054
[thunder rumbling]

39:00.371 --> 39:03.575
[Emma] <i>So, we have just got off the oars</i>
<i>after two hours</i>

39:03.641 --> 39:08.012
in crazy wind and waves and, um, rain,

39:08.079 --> 39:09.647
which was pretty unpleasant,

39:10.014 --> 39:14.118
and we haven't really made
very much progress during that two hours.

39:14.385 --> 39:15.987
In the time it took us to swap over,

39:16.054 --> 39:20.491
we've drifted north again,
so, we need to go south.

39:21.526 --> 39:24.362
Okay, I'll get up in a couple of hours
and do the log book.

39:24.429 --> 39:27.899
We're drawing a pretty beautiful picture.
We're now going east.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.067
[Laura] Yeah, I figured.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.836
[Emma] Just radio us if you need anything.

39:34.472 --> 39:36.040
-Night, guys!
-[woman] Good night.

39:46.117 --> 39:49.888
[Tony] <i>They've gotta cross over through</i>
<i>the Intertropical Convergence Zone,</i>

39:49.954 --> 39:52.056
which is the doldrums,
as the sailors used to call it.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.895
<i>There's a current which is running</i>
<i>in the opposite direction,</i>

39:56.961 --> 39:59.864
<i>so, it's running east, so,</i>
<i>a little bit like a riptide on a beach.</i>

39:59.931 --> 40:02.800
<i>They can't try and fight into it.</i>
<i>They need to get across it.</i>

40:03.902 --> 40:06.771
[Emma] <i>We seem to have entered</i>
<i>the equatorial countercurrent,</i>

40:06.838 --> 40:09.073
which is pushing us east very fast,

40:09.140 --> 40:12.143
and then we've got a southerly wind,
which is pushing us north,

40:12.744 --> 40:16.414
meaning that for quite a lot of the night
we've been going northeast,

40:16.481 --> 40:19.784
um, and Samoa, from here, is southwest.

40:24.455 --> 40:26.958
There's a lot of thunder activity,
so, it's gonna be hot and humid.

40:27.025 --> 40:31.195
<i>Large area to cross where the current</i>
<i>will take them in the wrong direction.</i>

40:38.770 --> 40:40.204
[Laura] What's going on, LV?

40:40.905 --> 40:42.607
[Lizanne] I'm feeling really nauseous.

40:45.443 --> 40:49.781
So, I just stay like this for a while
and then it goes away.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.787
We're very much
in the thick of the whole doldrums stuff

40:55.853 --> 40:58.790
going on at the moment,
so, some really weird weather.

41:06.931 --> 41:10.101
So much torrential rain and squalls

41:10.168 --> 41:12.804
<i>and dramatic skies,</i>

41:13.204 --> 41:14.806
<i>pan-flat oceans,</i>

41:15.139 --> 41:18.943
<i>incredible light reflected on the water.</i>

41:19.010 --> 41:22.113
<i>Just an ocean</i>
<i>that I've never known before.</i>

41:23.781 --> 41:25.783
[thunder rumbling]

41:26.617 --> 41:28.119
[Lizanne] <i>It's day 34,</i>

41:28.853 --> 41:31.522
and I'm still being seasick.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.725
I'm sick of being sick.

41:34.792 --> 41:38.129
I can't really keep food down.
My energy levels are low.

41:45.203 --> 41:48.639
<i>There's never a time on the boat</i>
<i>where you miss a shift.</i>

41:49.107 --> 41:53.811
<i>There's never a time where</i>
<i>you ask someone to sub in for you.</i>

41:53.878 --> 41:56.948
<i>You carry on two hours on, two hours off.</i>

41:59.283 --> 42:00.985
<i>I was sick over the side.</i>

42:01.052 --> 42:03.921
<i>I'd get back up and I'd carry on rowing.</i>

42:11.829 --> 42:13.798
[Natalia] <i>It's just a little bit painful</i>

42:13.865 --> 42:14.899
at the moment.

42:14.966 --> 42:18.002
Occasionally we'll pick up speed
and it'll be great,

42:18.069 --> 42:21.172
but it won't last longer
than a couple of shifts.

42:27.278 --> 42:29.313
[Emma] <i> We've really struggled</i>
<i>with adverse currents,</i>

42:29.580 --> 42:32.050
adverse winds.
We don't seem to have a lot of help

42:32.116 --> 42:34.619
going on at all from Mother Nature.

42:34.685 --> 42:36.687
<i>This leg has been a fight.</i>

42:36.754 --> 42:41.059
<i>I feel like we've been fighting the ocean,</i>
<i>fighting the currents, fighting the winds,</i>

42:41.125 --> 42:44.162
fighting the little gremlins
in my head that are telling me

42:44.228 --> 42:46.130
that we're never gonna get there.

42:47.899 --> 42:51.702
[Lizanne] <i>We thought we'd be</i>
<i>at the equator well over two weeks ago.</i>

42:51.769 --> 42:56.607
It's us against the currents, and we can't
row any harder than we are already.

42:56.674 --> 43:00.344
Our hands are aching and just trying to...

43:00.611 --> 43:02.713
Trying to row as hard as we can.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.115
I think we're all...

43:04.182 --> 43:05.283
[sniffs]

43:05.783 --> 43:08.252
getting a little bit low.

43:15.726 --> 43:19.130
[Natalia] <i>It's, um, day 42.</i>

43:19.730 --> 43:23.034
We are still stuck
in the doldrums, literally.

43:24.135 --> 43:25.970
We're just having a look
at the chartplotter.

43:26.037 --> 43:28.272
We've got about, um...

43:28.339 --> 43:33.911
239 nautical miles to go
until we hit the equator.

43:34.378 --> 43:36.714
At the current speed
at which we're traveling,

43:36.781 --> 43:40.718
it will take us another 20 days
just to get to the equator.

43:41.152 --> 43:42.620
Um...

43:42.687 --> 43:44.222
How do you feel about that, LP?

43:44.288 --> 43:45.223
Great.

43:47.625 --> 43:48.893
[both laugh]

44:12.783 --> 44:14.318
[whale bellows]

44:19.790 --> 44:22.126
[Natalia] <i>I'm so excited to see Samoa.</i>

44:22.193 --> 44:25.730
-I've been waiting for this for a year.
-You have.

44:25.796 --> 44:28.432
This is why you joined the row,
to come to Samoa.

44:28.699 --> 44:29.967
Pretty much, to see Samoa.

44:30.034 --> 44:32.270
I thought,
"What a great way to get to Samoa."

44:32.336 --> 44:34.705
You've seen a lot of sights in your time.

44:38.242 --> 44:42.914
[Natalia] <i>I look out into that ocean,</i>
<i>and my thoughts just stop.</i>

44:42.980 --> 44:47.318
<i>I don't know if that's because</i>
<i>I'm so used to spending time traveling</i>

44:47.385 --> 44:49.253
<i>and being on my own.</i>

44:49.320 --> 44:54.158
It's definitely the furthest outside
of my comfort zone I will ever have been,

44:54.225 --> 44:58.396
uh, in respect to the fact
that I've never rowed before.

45:01.132 --> 45:03.301
<i>If I believed it was</i>
<i>a predominantly physical challenge,</i>

45:03.367 --> 45:04.468
<i>I wouldn't have applied.</i>

45:04.735 --> 45:07.405
<i>This challenge is 90 percent mental.</i>

45:07.471 --> 45:12.076
<i>And I always believe that you do</i>
<i>your most developing and growth</i>

45:12.143 --> 45:14.245
<i>when you're outside your comfort zone.</i>

45:15.112 --> 45:18.916
When you put your mind to something,
anything is truly possible.

45:18.983 --> 45:19.984
And...

45:21.319 --> 45:22.420
I'm learning that.

45:26.290 --> 45:29.393
<i>Just had this overwhelming feeling</i>
<i>come over me,</i>

45:29.460 --> 45:32.863
where I just decided
that I just didn't want to row anymore.

45:32.930 --> 45:37.034
<i>I just got so bored of the motion</i>
<i>of going forwards and backwards,</i>

45:37.101 --> 45:40.271
<i>forwards and backwards,</i>
<i>and forwards and backwards,</i>

45:40.338 --> 45:42.239
<i>so, I screamed out into the air.</i>

45:42.306 --> 45:44.508
[screaming]

45:53.050 --> 45:57.221
The reason that I'm doing this row is
to test the strength of my human spirit.

45:57.288 --> 45:58.889
And to find...

45:59.857 --> 46:02.159
where that place is deep inside,

46:02.226 --> 46:06.364
where you have to dig deep
when things get tough.

46:10.101 --> 46:14.505
Things are just taking us a lot longer
than we anticipated.

46:15.373 --> 46:17.308
But it's these kind of moments,

46:18.342 --> 46:20.111
an amazing sky,

46:20.911 --> 46:22.380
four friends on a boat,

46:23.414 --> 46:25.783
and that makes it all all right!
[chuckles]

46:27.451 --> 46:28.986
[Laura] <i>Very poignant moment.</i>

46:29.053 --> 46:30.021
[Natalia] <i>Why's that?</i>

46:31.288 --> 46:32.556
'Cause we're near the equator!

46:32.823 --> 46:34.458
-Woo-hoo!
-Boop, boop!

46:34.525 --> 46:37.395
We've been waiting
for this moment for, uh...

46:38.162 --> 46:41.298
-Ever!
-Fifty-four days, I do believe.

46:41.365 --> 46:43.434
We're here.
That's all that flipping matters.

46:43.501 --> 46:44.869
[Natalia] Yeah. Exactly.

46:45.336 --> 46:46.971
[all] Three...

46:47.038 --> 46:48.172
[Natalia] Very slow countdown.

46:48.239 --> 46:49.140
[all] Two...

46:50.307 --> 46:51.308
One.

46:51.375 --> 46:52.977
[all] Whoo!

46:53.044 --> 46:54.378
[Laura] The equator!

46:54.445 --> 46:56.981
We're at the equator!

46:57.048 --> 46:58.182
Whoo!

47:00.217 --> 47:02.586
We'd like to make a toast to Neptune.

47:03.287 --> 47:07.058
Thank you for getting us
to the equator safely.

47:07.491 --> 47:12.430
And your ocean has become
very special to all of us, so...

47:13.431 --> 47:14.298
cheers!

47:16.367 --> 47:19.270
Ooh! [speaks in Spanish]

47:20.838 --> 47:23.074
And, please, will you make us
go quicker from here on.

47:23.140 --> 47:24.542
[all laugh]

47:33.984 --> 47:34.985
High five!

47:35.052 --> 47:36.120
High five!

48:03.447 --> 48:05.549
[Emma] <i>When we crossed the equator,</i>

48:05.616 --> 48:06.984
<i>Tony sent us a message</i>

48:07.051 --> 48:09.520
<i>and he was like, "Congratulations,</i>
<i>you're the first team of four</i>

48:09.587 --> 48:11.489
<i>who has ever rowed across the equator."</i>

48:11.555 --> 48:14.325
<i>We are self-supporting ourselves,</i>
<i>and we're this tiny little boat</i>

48:14.391 --> 48:17.628
<i>in this massive ocean,</i>
<i>and that's pretty special.</i>

48:21.532 --> 48:23.534
[both cheering]

48:40.117 --> 48:43.087
After struggling with currents

48:43.154 --> 48:45.055
and wind

48:45.122 --> 48:47.358
and doldrums,

48:48.025 --> 48:50.361
we are now into the heat phase.

48:51.262 --> 48:55.966
It is ridiculously hot outside,
and we're just dripping with sweat.

48:56.400 --> 48:59.270
It's almost, like, unbearably hot.

48:59.336 --> 49:01.539
Like, you can hardly breathe, it's so hot.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.376
We're back in the cabin, and it's 99--

49:05.442 --> 49:07.311
Nine-point-nine degrees Fahrenheit

49:07.378 --> 49:10.447
and it feels cool,
which is never a good sign.

49:20.958 --> 49:21.992
[sighs]

49:23.427 --> 49:26.130
Just come in
from a two-hour rowing session.

49:28.399 --> 49:32.536
Possibly the hottest, uh,
I've ever been in my life.

49:33.537 --> 49:34.572
<i>Fairly unbearable,</i>

49:34.638 --> 49:37.508
<i>just not knowing what to do with yourself.</i>

49:53.190 --> 49:54.992
[computer panel beeps]

49:59.730 --> 50:04.568
[Emma] <i>Today we got an e-mail from Tony</i>
<i>talking about our timeline.</i>

50:04.635 --> 50:07.471
<i>So, it's looking like it's going</i>
<i>to take us at least another 30 days,</i>

50:07.538 --> 50:11.141
<i>which kind of makes us another month</i>
<i>behind schedule.</i>

50:13.143 --> 50:16.013
<i>We had our little kind of chat</i>
<i>about it all together,</i>

50:16.080 --> 50:17.381
<i>and Laura was saying:</i>

50:18.249 --> 50:20.684
"We can't assume everyone
is okay with that

50:20.751 --> 50:23.387
and everyone is going to want
to get back in the boat in Samoa."

50:24.521 --> 50:27.791
-We're gonna be rowing at Christmas.
-Yeah, we are.

50:28.058 --> 50:29.727
Christmas on <i>Doris!</i>

50:30.594 --> 50:31.462
No.

50:32.329 --> 50:34.098
LP can't be rowing
on Christmas on <i>Doris.</i>

50:34.164 --> 50:35.332
I know.

50:43.340 --> 50:44.508
[Laura] <i>It's actually my work.</i>

50:45.509 --> 50:48.579
Part of why I'm here
is because of what I do with Paralympics

50:48.646 --> 50:52.583
and working with the Paralympic team
and British athletics.

50:53.651 --> 50:54.618
Um...

50:56.153 --> 50:56.820
And...

50:58.055 --> 51:01.292
you know,
this year is not a great year for me

51:01.358 --> 51:05.562
to have been out doing this row.
It was already a problem I postponed it.

51:05.629 --> 51:08.432
More of a problem myself.
My work are brilliant.

51:08.499 --> 51:10.701
They've been extremely supportive.

51:11.368 --> 51:14.805
Which is why it's even harder because
I just don't want to let the team down.

51:15.572 --> 51:17.675
But the problem is
I don't want to let that team down,

51:17.741 --> 51:22.413
and I don't want to let this team down.
I feel like I'm a little bit torn.

51:24.481 --> 51:27.217
<i>And everything out here</i>
<i>is taking so much bloody longer</i>

51:27.685 --> 51:29.386
<i>and it's so unpredictable</i>

51:29.453 --> 51:32.323
that I have no idea when
we're gonna finish this damn thing.

51:33.223 --> 51:36.827
<i>The hardest thing is having to choose</i>
<i>between the row or work.</i>

51:38.128 --> 51:40.864
Not finishing this row
and not being in Australia kills me.

51:42.800 --> 51:44.168
<i>So, it's basically...</i>

51:45.869 --> 51:48.772
<i>my immediate family of four</i>
<i>that are on this boat</i>

51:48.839 --> 51:50.374
<i>compared to...</i>

51:51.775 --> 51:53.677
the whole British Athletics team,
I don't know.

52:04.655 --> 52:07.725
I don't know if I want to be rowing
on Christmas on <i>Doris.</i>

52:08.525 --> 52:10.728
I don't want to be rowing
on Christmas on <i>Doris.</i>

52:11.395 --> 52:13.430
But I don't want to not row
all the way to Australia.

52:13.497 --> 52:14.498
No, I know.

52:45.729 --> 52:48.866
[Lizanne] <i>Before we set off on the row...</i>

52:49.533 --> 52:53.537
<i>Keith, our psychologist,</i>
<i>got each of us doing a family plan.</i>

52:53.604 --> 52:57.174
<i>It was really difficult to do</i>
<i>because you have to write</i>

52:57.241 --> 52:59.943
<i>a step-by-step plan</i>
<i>of how do you want to find out</i>

53:00.210 --> 53:02.212
<i>if something happens to your family.</i>

53:02.546 --> 53:04.748
It was one of my fears
before I got on the boat

53:04.815 --> 53:08.318
that something might happen
to a family member

53:08.385 --> 53:09.686
or someone that I love,

53:10.220 --> 53:11.655
and that's happened.

53:11.722 --> 53:13.724
[crying]

53:15.626 --> 53:17.494
<i>I received some news that,</i>

53:17.561 --> 53:20.764
unfortunately, my uncle
has lost his fight with cancer,

53:21.932 --> 53:24.868
and I didn't expect that to happen
while I was on the boat.

53:26.470 --> 53:28.639
<i>He was a remarkable man,</i>

53:28.705 --> 53:32.376
<i>and it breaks my heart</i>
<i>that I can't be there with them right now.</i>

53:33.844 --> 53:34.812
And there's...

53:35.646 --> 53:38.382
a real sense of helplessness.

53:45.522 --> 53:47.558
I'm so sorry that I'm not there.

53:49.660 --> 53:53.297
<i>All I really wanted to do was just go</i>
<i>for a walk and clear my head,</i>

53:53.730 --> 53:54.631
<i>and you can't.</i>

53:54.698 --> 53:57.367
<i>You're on that boat</i>
<i>and you can't get away.</i>

53:58.769 --> 54:03.707
But what it has done
is it has really driven home to me

54:03.774 --> 54:05.242
why I'm out here

54:05.309 --> 54:06.944
and why we're doing what we're doing.

54:07.544 --> 54:09.847
<i>We're helping someone fight a fight.</i>

54:11.448 --> 54:12.549
<i>It's given me a push,</i>

54:12.616 --> 54:15.252
<i>and it's made me work</i>
<i>that little bit harder</i>

54:15.319 --> 54:17.254
<i>to reach our destination.</i>

54:19.456 --> 54:20.591
Life is fragile.

54:21.892 --> 54:25.262
That's why we're doing crazy things
like row an ocean,

54:25.896 --> 54:27.498
because you only have one life,

54:27.564 --> 54:30.400
so, you might as well
make the most of it.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.743
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>I can't believe I'm not there.</i>

55:10.374 --> 55:12.609
We're a little bit worried
that we're gonna miss Samoa.

55:16.580 --> 55:20.350
<i>Yeah, don't want to miss Samoa,</i>
<i>because the next stop would be Fiji,</i>

55:20.417 --> 55:21.952
<i>and that's another 500 miles.</i>

55:22.019 --> 55:23.954
[Natalia] <i>Yeah, 5-, 600 miles.</i>

55:25.088 --> 55:26.690
There's a very strong westerly current

55:26.757 --> 55:28.825
and there's very strong winds
of 15 to 18 knots

55:28.892 --> 55:30.594
that are southeasterly.

55:31.662 --> 55:35.699
<i>At this precise moment,</i>
<i>we're in fear of missing Samoa.</i>

55:37.868 --> 55:43.340
Been struggling with just doing
the same thing every day

55:43.407 --> 55:46.577
<i>and going so slowly.</i>
<i>It feels a bit endless at the moment.</i>

55:47.477 --> 55:48.812
[woman over phone] <i> What's going on?</i>

55:48.879 --> 55:50.747
We're just getting caught
in the currents still.

55:50.814 --> 55:54.051
We're going completely west now, as well.
It's a nightmare.

55:55.385 --> 55:58.722
We're doing what we can.
We can only control the controllable.

56:09.933 --> 56:12.869
Leg two has been really difficult...

56:12.936 --> 56:15.806
um, for the majority of us on the boat.

56:15.872 --> 56:17.774
The monotony, the boredom.

56:18.442 --> 56:20.477
You know, Lizanne,
bless her, losing her uncle.

56:20.544 --> 56:22.479
I've had issues
with obviously the length of time

56:22.546 --> 56:25.882
we're now out here for
has impacted on my work.

56:26.483 --> 56:28.819
<i>But one person in particular is Emma...</i>

56:29.519 --> 56:32.522
<i>who's for a few weeks now</i>
<i>has been in a really, really...</i>

56:33.523 --> 56:35.926
<i>difficult sort of place</i>
<i>and hasn't been sharing it.</i>

56:36.693 --> 56:38.629
<i>But you knew that something was wrong.</i>

56:38.695 --> 56:39.896
<i>She's my teammate.</i>

56:40.397 --> 56:42.165
<i>I want to make her happy,</i>
<i>I want to see her smile,</i>

56:42.432 --> 56:43.634
<i>I want to hear her laugh,</i>

56:45.035 --> 56:46.903
and she's not doing any of those things,

56:46.970 --> 56:48.905
and I don't know what I can do to help.

56:57.581 --> 57:01.084
[Emma] <i>I'm so tired right now.</i>

57:01.151 --> 57:04.521
We've just been rowing so hard
every single shift

57:05.088 --> 57:07.557
and I've not got anything...

57:07.991 --> 57:08.859
Um...

57:09.626 --> 57:10.627
Anything left to give.

57:10.694 --> 57:14.197
Like, physically and mentally,
I'm just completely exhausted.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.034
And, um...

57:17.868 --> 57:21.204
I don't know how long we've still got
to go to Samoa. We keep...

57:22.105 --> 57:24.441
going a bit faster
and we think we're going to get there

57:24.508 --> 57:26.576
and then we slow down
and start going the wrong way.

57:28.712 --> 57:30.614
Being out on the oars
has always been where...

57:31.682 --> 57:33.617
I've been really happy and where...

57:33.684 --> 57:34.751
Um...

57:36.486 --> 57:37.587
[sighs]

57:39.456 --> 57:40.824
<i>I've started to really hate it.</i>

57:40.891 --> 57:44.461
<i>I've started to really hate every time</i>
<i>I have to get out on the oars and row.</i>

57:45.896 --> 57:48.732
<i>I've been really struggling.</i>
<i>I haven't been able to control the boat.</i>

57:48.799 --> 57:51.568
<i>It doesn't seem to matter what I do,</i>
<i>it doesn't make any difference.</i>

57:53.904 --> 57:56.707
Rowing has been part of my life
for such a long time,

57:56.773 --> 57:58.575
like a really important part.

58:03.613 --> 58:06.883
<i>If someone told me I never had</i>
<i>to row again, I would be really happy,</i>

58:07.818 --> 58:09.786
and that makes me really sad because...

58:15.158 --> 58:18.895
<i>we've still a long way to go,</i>
<i>another leg to get to Cairns,</i>

58:19.663 --> 58:21.598
<i>and I don't know if I can...</i>

58:23.033 --> 58:23.900
<i>Yeah.</i>

59:02.172 --> 59:05.208
[Tony] <i>Just getting the latest position.</i>
<i>I believe we are about two miles away</i>

59:05.275 --> 59:07.811
<i>but I just want to double-check</i>
<i>the little dot</i>

59:07.878 --> 59:10.313
we're seeing on the horizon
is actually them.

59:12.649 --> 59:14.885
There they are,
right in the horizon there!

59:38.575 --> 59:41.745
[Laura] <i>We have been battling</i>
<i>the currents, the winds.</i>

59:41.812 --> 59:44.181
We were extremely concerned at points

59:44.247 --> 59:46.883
that we may have to overshoot Samoa,

59:46.950 --> 59:50.187
which was devastating to us
that that might have been the case.

59:50.253 --> 59:53.790
And I think the thought of that
made us dig even deeper

59:53.857 --> 59:55.158
than we thought we could do,

59:55.992 --> 59:59.663
and we powered as hard as we could,
and we were absolutely--

59:59.729 --> 01:00:02.899
I think we left everything on the boat,
everything on the ocean, just to get here,

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:03.934
and I'm so glad we did,

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.838
because this would have been a devastation
to have missed this.

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:11.241
We are very proud to be here
and to share this with you.

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:22.719
[crowd cheering]

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:30.193
For Emma,
this journey was a really big challenge

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.930
because she wanted to be able
to control the boat.

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:39.769
<i>And one person cannot control</i>
<i>a one-ton boat.</i>

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.339
You know, it's physically impossible.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:49.179
[Tony] <i>When you gear yourself up</i>
<i>for being at sea for 60 days</i>

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:51.214
and you're out there for over 90,

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:53.250
it's got to affect how you feel,
hasn't it?

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:59.222
[Lizanne] <i> When rowing wasn't fun</i>
<i>for her anymore...</i>

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:02.726
it was really hard to watch because...

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:06.363
it wouldn't make her happy,
it would make her frustrated.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.399
<i>I hope that she finds her happy place.</i>

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:17.707
What she's really needed to do
is actually step back and take stock

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:21.811
of not only what she's doing
but who she is as a person, really,

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:27.217
because I think, you know, when
the essence of who you are is questioned,

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:30.921
<i>then where do you go from there?</i>

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:37.928
[Laura] <i>Getting to the finish and knowing</i>

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:40.697
<i>that you've achieved</i>
<i>what you've set out to achieve...</i>

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:42.232
<i>You know, it's four years of hard work.</i>

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:45.235
I mean, to walk away from it
any sooner than that,

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:47.137
I would just be devastated.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:50.006
So, to me, Australia is home
and nothing ever before that.

01:01:50.774 --> 01:01:52.042
[both shout]

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:07.390
[Natalia] That is like a big blooming...

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:09.793
-[Lizanne] Rhino horn.
-...rhino horn.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:18.802
I can't believe I'm leaving.
I can't believe this day has come.

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:22.172
I've built a really special bond
with each of you.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:25.175
Best of luck for your last leg.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:28.245
You've got an amazing new asset
to the team.

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.013
Meg, good luck.

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:37.887
<i>The value of a team is so much more</i>
<i>than I've ever imagined.</i>

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:41.191
And we will forever be the girls
who rowed together.

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:58.441
[Meg] <i>My name is Meg Dyos, and I'm 25.</i>

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.244
No one tells you when you finish uni
it's not very exciting.

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:03.246
It's like, what do you want to do
with your life?

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:04.981
It's always, you have to have an answer.

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:08.118
When you don't have an answer,
it's like, "Oh, oh, dear."

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:11.187
And that's where it's like,
"Is there something wrong with me

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.290
that I don't know what I want to do
with my life?"

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:14.557
<i>I've never rowed before.</i>

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:17.827
<i>I've never been on a rowing boat.</i>
<i>I've never been in the ocean.</i>

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.865
In all honesty, I have absolutely
no idea why they chose me.

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:24.000
I mean, I couldn't be happier
that they chose me,

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:26.202
and I really hope there is something
they've seen in me

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:28.338
that can help us get to Australia.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:29.439
<i>I mean, no pressure.</i>

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:37.580
[Tony] <i>The season is ticking on,</i>
<i>and we need to get them to Australia.</i>

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:39.883
<i>The fact that they're stopping</i>
<i>and rowing again,</i>

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:42.185
<i>I've never had to do before</i>
<i>with a team of rowers.</i>

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:44.954
I struggle to understand
how hard that is gonna be

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:46.556
for them to get back on the boat.

<i>to be the fact</i>
<i>that I would stop enjoying it.</i>

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.995
This is why I wanted to do the row.
I wanted to challenge myself

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:00.430

We're doing it. Uh, as hard as it is,
we're actually doing it.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:24.421
Just had a bit of a hit that this
is the last time we step on <i> Doris,</i>

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:26.656
the last leg, what we've been through.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.292
Feeling quite overwhelmed,
to be honest, at the moment,

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.094
in a good way.

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:48.545
[Emma] Okay, Meggy,
what are you having for dinner?

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.046
Beef curry!

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:53.450
It's my first try. It's actually
a bit hot, so, I'm going to blow it.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:57.020
I'm really excited. I think I'm going
to like it. It smells great.

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:01.524
Okay.

01:06:01.591 --> 01:06:02.692
I see why you don't like it.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:03.993

[Emma] <i>We're training Meggy</i>

01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:11.267
<i>She's doing very well.</i>

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.139
[Meg] <i>There's just one thing...</i>

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:20.009
I really want to try and get better at it,
and it's just the routine.

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:22.679
Just... everything is routine.

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:25.315
<i>Like you never even know what the time is.</i>

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.617
<i>You don't have a clue</i>
<i>what the time is ever.</i>

01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:32.989
<i>What Meg doesn't realize still is</i>
<i>that time has no meaning on</i> Doris.

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:35.391
<i>It's just two-hour shifts.</i>

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:36.993
[Natalia] <i>Being out here, I know</i>

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.661
when it's daylight,
I know when it's night,

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:40.630
and nothing else really matters.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:44.300
When it's sunrise the day begins,
and when it's sunset the day ends,

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:46.636
<i>and in between you just row</i>

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:54.544
[Meg] <i>Those first few days, oh, my God,</i>

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:57.480
the waves were so huge
and we were being pushed off our seats,

01:06:57.547 --> 01:07:00.283
which is, by the way, one of the scariest
things that could happen.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:04.187
<i>Especially when you only learned to row</i>
<i>about two days previous to leaving Samoa.</i>

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:08.558
I was just so scared, and the girls,
none of them seem scared.

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:12.428
It was just me, and I felt a bit alone.
I felt really alone, actually.

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:15.665
<i>That's the thing.</i>
<i>I'm the most underqualified rower by far.</i>

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:17.467
<i>I know the bare minimum,</i>

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.402
and I'm kind of happy with that.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:37.620
Leg three, day ten.

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:39.556
Time is flying.

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:42.191
-Flying. We're going fast still.
-[laughs nervously]

01:07:42.258 --> 01:07:44.427
We're not really sure
what to do with this.

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:46.262
-We keep waiting for it to disappear.
-Yeah.

01:07:46.329 --> 01:07:49.132
Every time we get out on the oars,
we think we'll be going slow again,

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:51.768
but so far...
we're still going quite fast.

01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:56.105
[Natalia] <i>We're traveling</i>
<i>at like an amazing speed</i>

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:59.776
<i>and in the right direction,</i>
<i>which is just unheard of.</i>

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:08.785
We've done seven miles
in the last two hours.

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:09.719
Woo-hoo!

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:13.823
That's definitely the most miles
that has been done on <i>Doris.</i>

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:27.804
We are less than 350 miles away
from Vanuatu,

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.506
which will be pretty much halfway,
which is quite exciting.

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:05.341
[Meg] <i>Waking up every two hours</i>

<i>It doesn't matter how bad you're feeling.</i>

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.519
<i>You don't have a choice.</i>
<i>You have to get back on the oars</i>

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:18.254
<i>and you have to row.</i>

<i>one of the most hectic shifts so far.</i>

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:35.238
Big, massive, massive waves.

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:38.875
I don't think I've had a less fun shift
on <i>Doris</i> so far.

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:41.577
These three girls.

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:45.448
It makes me a bit emotional
when I even think about them

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.250
<i>and just... how far they've gone.</i>

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:50.219
<i>And I feel like in each of them,</i>
<i>I've seen...</i>

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:52.755
<i>I've seen some sort of pain.</i>

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:55.692
<i>And you can just tell</i>
<i>that they've been at sea for a long time.</i>

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.936
[Emma] <i>We've been living in this</i>
<i>for eight months.</i>

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:11.474
It's become all that we've known, really.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:14.711
-This is just life.
-It's such a strange existence.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:17.980
Eight months is such a long time
to do something.

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:22.485
I wonder what we'll be like
when we get back to land.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:27.256
I wonder how quickly
we'll adapt to sort of so much noise

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:30.460
-and pollution and people.
-People.

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:33.529
[Emma] <i> Life will be so complicated</i>
<i>after this.</i>

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:37.867
[Natalia] <i>There's definitely</i>
<i>a big part of me that wants to hold on</i>

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:39.936
<i>and wants to stay out here</i>

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:44.540
<i>because of the utter beauty</i>
<i>of where we are.</i>

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:46.843
<i>There's just nothing like it.</i>

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:48.945
<i>The only way I can describe it</i>

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:53.816
for me is that it's been ultimate freedom
out here.

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:56.819
Just freedom from...

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.622
societal norms,

01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:02.992

<i>from the ego...</i>

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:07.597
<i>It's just been an incredible opportunity</i>

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:11.701
to delve so deeply within your soul.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:20.576
[Emma] <i>So, yeah, it's crazy.</i>
<i>I can't believe it's nearly Christmas.</i>

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:22.678
And when we left the U.K.,

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:25.681
it was the very beginning of April.
It's absolutely mental.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.416
I can't believe we're still out here.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:31.020
<i>And I don't know how we're still doing</i>
<i>what we're doing every day, every shift,</i>

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.722

and we're listening
to Christmas carols and stuff and...

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:52.975
Um, yeah, I just found it quite difficult,
really, being away.

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:55.378
<i>Didn't realize how difficult I'd find it.</i>

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:58.514
Hi, Auntie Mary. How are you?
Happy Christmas!

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.696
Mom, the signal's not very good.
I can't hear you very well.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:17.767
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:22.371
The signal isn't very good.

It's main-course time. Main course.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.935
It's roast-potatoes time, let's face it.

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:55.004
-It's roast potatoes and gravy.
-Yeah.

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:57.006
Um, being out here's way better.

01:12:57.073 --> 01:13:00.042
We've got our socks on.
I'm in a wet bed sheet.

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:01.878
Soggy sheet. [laughs]

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:35.705
This is definitely one of the best ways
to bring in a new year.

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:39.041
In the middle of this beautiful,
wonderful, huge,

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:41.644
enormous, expansive ocean.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:53.656
It is day 55, and in my prediction,
we have 15 days to go.

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:55.658
In yours we have 25.

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:56.859
Let's hope you're right.

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:58.794
The food is 13.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.644
Four hundred and ninety-eight miles to go.

01:15:18.948 --> 01:15:20.783
[Emma] <i> We had such a good start</i>
<i>to this leg,</i>

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.752
and everyone got really overexcited.

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:26.756
Our parents booked their flights
to Australia to come meet us,

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:29.525
and then
it's all gone kind of horribly wrong.

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:32.895
This precise moment,
I'm completely over it.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:36.265
<i>My hip and back have really flared up.</i>

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:50.713
Over 215 days now at sea in total,
not including our stop-offs...

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:55.251
having rowed over 7000 flipping miles...

01:15:56.652 --> 01:16:00.890
and been out here for nearly nine months,
it's starting to take its toll just a bit.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.961
I'm so looking forward to getting to
that finish line, you would not believe.

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:12.601
<i>Ugh. I just really want to get home.</i>

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.659
[Natalia] <i>The last few days have been</i>

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:41.964
<i>a little bit of a struggle.</i>
<i>Not only are we in a confined space,</i>

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:43.732
<i>we're sleep-deprived.</i>

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:46.001
<i>We're quite often in physical pain.</i>

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:48.871
<i>They're cumulative,</i>
<i>and they start to take their toll.</i>

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:52.074
-[Laura] What's going on, Megs?
-I'm tired.

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:55.144
I'm really tired and I can't stay awake.

01:16:55.211 --> 01:16:58.747
And I feel like I can't get
the tiredness away,

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:01.884
because there's no time in the day
to catch up on sleep.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.694
[Emma] <i> We're gonna run out</i>
<i>of meals soon.</i>

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:15.131
Which means we've gotta do 50 miles
from tomorrow onwards.

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:17.933
Okay, we might.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.036
Hmm, I reckon it will take one
or two days longer than that.

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:23.005
One or two?

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:23.939
Hopefully, yeah.

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:26.008
So, you think we might have
five days without meals?

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:27.209
Yeah.

01:17:30.713 --> 01:17:34.216
[Natalia] <i>We're, like, starving.</i>
<i>We're starving, starving.</i>

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:37.186
It feels like we haven't eaten for ages.

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:38.654
Forever.

01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:40.022
The last thing I had was M&Ms.

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:44.727
Oh, no, I had a packet of M&Ms
and this morning a bag of nuts.

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:46.896
[Natalia] Nuts, we had nuts a while ago.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:02.845
So, I've just come into the forecabin
after a sunset shift with Nat.

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:05.414
<i>Something's gone wrong</i>
<i>with one of our batteries.</i>

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:09.218
<i>They both drained completely</i>
<i>and ran really low on power,</i>

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:13.255
<i>so, we had to switch everything off</i>
<i>and navigate just using our compass.</i>

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:16.292
We haven't really got power to do
anything else, so, for the last few days

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:21.797
we've been hand-pumping water using
our emergency backup water maker.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:26.869
<i>So, in our two-hour rest shifts,</i>
<i>we've been having to spend an hour of that</i>

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:29.738
<i>sitting out in the heat and the sunshine</i>

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:33.943
<i>pumping water,</i>
<i>which is actually surprisingly hard work.</i>

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:35.044
<i>It's so painfully slow.</i>

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:38.747
So, our electric water maker makes
30 liters of water an hour,

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:42.051
and our hand pump makes
about three liters of water an hour,

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:46.755
and that's if you don't rest or drink
or do anything while you're going, so...

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:50.226
<i>Obviously, the longer that we're out here,</i>
<i>we're getting into cyclone season</i>

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:51.727
<i>and that's not ideal.</i>

01:18:51.794 --> 01:18:53.862
The winds are getting
less and less favorable.

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:56.131
The risk of cyclones is getting higher.

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:58.334
<i>We're definitely not as strong</i>
<i>as we used to be.</i>

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.915
[Tony] <i>You can make landfall on a beach</i>
<i>to complete the record.</i>

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:15.184
<i>Looks like it's our only choice.</i>

01:19:17.186 --> 01:19:18.454
How close are they?

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:21.023
They're within two miles.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:22.858
They're about a mile and a half away.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:24.460
Mile and a half away.

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:33.535
[Natalia] <i>We're about 20 miles away</i>
<i>from Cairns,</i>

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:37.940
<i>and this should be one</i>
<i>of the best moments of the trip.</i>

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:43.779
Yet, as always seems to happen,
we get thrown another challenge.

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:50.286
<i>We're fighting wind now and current.</i>

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:53.355
And it doesn't look likely
that we're going to make the marina

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:55.557
where we're supposed to sort of arrive.

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:58.193
Where we should have actually arrived
two days ago.

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:01.330
So, we have one last option,

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:06.068
<i>which is to get to landfall,</i>
<i>so, it's not the marina, but it's land.</i>

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:09.104
<i>And that will at least mean</i>
<i>it's a successful expedition.</i>

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:14.209
<i>Due to adverse currents and lack of food,</i>

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:17.346
<i>we have until sunrise tomorrow</i>

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:19.882
to make that landfall.

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:21.950
<i>Otherwise we may need to be rescued.</i>

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:28.157
It's just... [sniffs]

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.528
so near but yet so fricking far.

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:34.897
Like how...

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:38.467
the project could just be...

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:43.972
disqualified in the last 20 miles
because we can't reach land.

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:52.147
[Natalia] <i>This is giving 110 percent</i>
<i>into every stroke,</i>

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:56.352
<i>which we're not too sure</i>
<i>if it's sustainable or not, to be honest.</i>

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:05.627
<i>Over 8000 nautical miles</i>
<i>from America to Australia...</i>

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:09.031
and all that matters is

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:14.303
<i>the last 2.15 nautical miles.</i>

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:17.072
<i>This is it. This is the final push.</i>

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.108
<i>We can do this.</i>

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:32.588
[Laura] <i>We're here.</i>

01:21:33.489 --> 01:21:37.259
I can see land out the window.
Like, that's Australia.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:43.899
And it's really bizarre to think
of everything that we've gone through

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.335
for four years.

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:48.437
Four years of relentless...

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:52.441
not giving up, of persevering...

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:57.146
of just believing in something
so strongly...

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:59.615
<i>to make it happen, and it's here.</i>

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.989
<i>For the expedition to be complete,</i>

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:09.992
we needed to go from mainland America
to mainland Australia.

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:14.696
And the thing is currents and wind
have not been in our favor lately.

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:15.931
So...

01:22:15.998 --> 01:22:19.034
instead of rowing into the marina,
which is taking us way too long,

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:22.104
and we've just been
caught by the currents,

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:26.041
we decided to bring her in
to a beach on the mainland,

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:30.145
and then, very kindly, sort of a couple
of Australians that live here

01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:33.182
have offered then that they would tow us
round to the marina.

01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:41.557
<i>All that matters now is planting our feet</i>
<i>on the shore of Australia</i>

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.258
<i>and making history.</i>

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:54.069
[Tony] <i>The girls landed on a beach</i>

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:56.305
<i>so they could claim</i>
<i>the land-to-land unassisted record.</i>

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:05.280
<i>They then had to get back on </i> Doris,

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:07.149
<i>row back out,</i>
<i>and be towed into the marina,</i>

01:23:07.216 --> 01:23:09.685
<i>where all their family and friends</i>
<i>were waiting.</i>

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:19.221
[all] We did it!

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:32.601
[Laura] <i>All I kept thinking about is,</i>
<i>one day someone is going to do this.</i>

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:35.404
So, what's gonna make them
be able to do it over you guys?

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:36.838
It's only the fact of digging deep

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:40.208
and just keep getting back up
every time you get knocked down.

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:44.413

cry or laugh, not sure which way yet.
