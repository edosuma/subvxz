00:02.240 --> 00:03.399
TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:03.439 --> 00:03.799
-Ready?

00:03.839 --> 00:04.400
Now!

00:11.640 --> 00:15.199
-We are gonna be putting
on the event of the year.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.519
[party music playing]

00:16.559 --> 00:18.640
-Can you take a
photo of us, Abigail?

00:24.160 --> 00:24.719
GIRL: What?

00:24.760 --> 00:25.800
BOY: The photo.

00:25.839 --> 00:27.359
-I've been unfair to you, and--

00:27.399 --> 00:28.800
-I think I know what it is.

00:28.839 --> 00:30.199
-You do?

00:30.239 --> 00:31.199
-You're scared of
falling, so I got you--

00:31.239 --> 00:33.200
-You got me a bird.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.479
ETHAN: I think she is.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.200
Check it out.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.840
-I'm sorry, mate.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.439
I didn't mean--

00:43.479 --> 00:46.600
-You were all at the party
when the police arrived,

00:46.640 --> 00:49.759
so you are all on detention
until further notice.

00:49.799 --> 00:50.719
KAT: But I--

00:50.759 --> 00:51.600
MR. KENNEDY: Back to class.

00:59.200 --> 01:05.078
THEME SONG: Whoa-oh,
oh, whoa-oh.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.560
Take a breath.

01:08.599 --> 01:12.040
Close your eyes.

01:12.079 --> 01:15.519
Take a leap of faith
and lead the way

01:15.560 --> 01:20.480
tonight, tonight, tonight.

01:20.519 --> 01:22.799
This is my chance.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.799
This is my chance, my
chance to feel alive.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.799
Whoa-oh.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.439
Whoa-oh.

01:47.239 --> 01:50.200
TARA (VOICEOVER): When I was
little, I adopted a lamb.

01:50.239 --> 01:51.640
Its mother had died.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.799
And so every morning I got
up at 5:00 to bottle feed it.

01:53.840 --> 01:58.040
-OK, you've got an hour to
pitch tents and get organized.

01:58.079 --> 01:59.480
-Toilet, sir?

01:59.519 --> 02:01.280
-Uh, third tree.

02:01.319 --> 02:03.120
-Right this way, girls.

02:03.159 --> 02:06.400
-Should we be worried
about brown snakes?

02:06.439 --> 02:08.800
-No, the real
danger is trumpets.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.639
Imagine koalas,
only flesh eating.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.400
-OK, three people to a tent,
so pick your sleeping buddies.

02:13.439 --> 02:14.039
-Yup.

02:14.080 --> 02:14.639
I choose Kat.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.800
-[laugh]

02:15.840 --> 02:18.520
-Boys are on the other
side of the hill.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.199
-Uh, I guess you're with us.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.199
TARA (VOICEOVER): One day I was
in a hurry to get to ballet.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.520
And I left the gate open.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.159
-If you're homeless, Ms.
Histead won't mind sharing.

02:31.159 --> 02:32.599
TARA (VOICEOVER):
When we got home,

02:32.639 --> 02:34.599
there was blood everywhere.

02:34.639 --> 02:36.400
The dogs had gotten him.

02:36.439 --> 02:37.719
My lamb was gone.

02:37.759 --> 02:41.159
It was the first time I
realized that sometimes when

02:41.199 --> 02:44.159
you make a mistake, you have
to live with it forever.

03:00.199 --> 03:00.800
-What's that?

03:00.840 --> 03:02.599
-Nothing.

03:02.639 --> 03:05.759
I found it in my locker.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.719
It's Kat.

03:06.759 --> 03:08.319
I know it's her.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.840
-OK, so she's not president of
your fan club at the moment,

03:10.879 --> 03:13.080
but she wouldn't go
and do something like--

03:13.120 --> 03:14.159
-Freeze me out.

03:14.199 --> 03:15.360
Not listen to my
zillion apologies.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.840
-Hey, I think there's
stuff going on

03:16.879 --> 03:18.360
with her that we
don't know about.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.800
-I made one bad judgment
call, and now I'm the enemy.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.439
-What did you expect, T?

03:23.479 --> 03:25.639
Her brother was off-limits and
you went out with him anyway.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.560
OK?

03:26.599 --> 03:27.319
And then you went and--

03:27.360 --> 03:27.800
-Cheated on him.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.759
Just say it.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.599
There's pictorial evidence.

03:30.639 --> 03:32.120
-I'm not taking sides.

03:32.159 --> 03:33.080
-Hey, Sammy, come here.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.319
I want to tell you a story.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.599
-Yeah, you're Switzerland.

03:37.639 --> 03:39.360
-Mr. Lieberman.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.400
My classroom, five minutes.

03:48.319 --> 03:49.479
-Is this gonna take long?

03:49.520 --> 03:51.080
-You'll be out of
here as soon as you've

03:51.120 --> 03:52.159
handed in your assignment.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.159
-Oh, um, I have a note.

03:54.199 --> 03:57.439
-Sammy, will you
mind reading these?

03:57.479 --> 03:58.560
-Sure.

03:58.599 --> 03:59.639
OK.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.159
Uh Abigail was
unable to complete

04:01.199 --> 04:03.080
her assignment due to eyestrain.

04:03.120 --> 04:09.159
Abigail was unable to--
tonsillitis, bronchitis, uh,

04:09.199 --> 04:09.800
dermatitis.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.159
You have dermatitis?

04:11.199 --> 04:12.159
-Interesting none
of these conditions

04:12.199 --> 04:14.439
prevented you from dancing.

04:14.479 --> 04:16.600
-I preserve my energy
for what's important.

04:16.639 --> 04:18.600
I find it important that
you're failing English.

04:18.639 --> 04:21.319
And if that continues, I'll
keep you down next year,

04:21.360 --> 04:23.480
no matter how well you dance.

04:23.519 --> 04:24.800
-You wouldn't.

04:24.839 --> 04:27.720
-Before you go on camp,
you will submit a new essay

04:27.759 --> 04:29.759
on "Midsummer Night's Dream."

04:29.800 --> 04:32.160
Sammy will be your tutor.

04:32.199 --> 04:34.319
-I'm not sure I'm the best
person for this job, Miss.

04:34.360 --> 04:37.480
-Well, according to Miss Raine,
you're both on detention.

04:37.519 --> 04:41.839
So instead of doing that,
tonight I own your derrieres.

04:41.879 --> 04:43.399
[laugh]

04:43.439 --> 04:44.680
-In two days' time, when
you're surrounded by nature--

04:44.720 --> 04:47.160
-Remind me again why we're
ditching civilization.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.439
-Inspiration.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.800
You're going to be
dancing in the open air,

04:50.839 --> 04:54.199
workshopping variations from
the "Midsummer Night's Dream."

04:54.240 --> 04:56.600
There's some acrobatic elements
in the modern version, skills

04:56.639 --> 04:58.120
you may need if you're
thinking of joining

04:58.160 --> 04:59.319
a contemporary company.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.319
--[laughs] Your worst
nightmare, huh?

05:01.360 --> 05:04.319
Camping, acro-- you're
outside your comfort zone.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.079
-Sylvie Guillem used
to be a gymnast.

05:19.639 --> 05:21.160
World's best dancer?

05:24.639 --> 05:25.759
-Sorry.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.160
-I'll catch you if
you fall, all right?

05:27.199 --> 05:27.800
-Aw, adorable.

05:27.839 --> 05:29.279
Did you hear that?

05:29.319 --> 05:30.480
He's gonna catch her.

05:30.519 --> 05:33.079
-Yeah, catch her or
catch something off her.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.199
-Ignore them, all right?

05:53.639 --> 05:54.639
-Hey.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.560
Can I talk to you?

05:57.600 --> 06:00.519
Just for a minute.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.680
TEEN: Hey, awkward.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.639
-Um.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.040
-Yeah?

06:06.079 --> 06:07.480
-So someone-- someone
gave this back to me.

06:07.519 --> 06:11.399
And I thought-- well, I
thought you could return it.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.199
-Yeah.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.120
-But it's not right.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.839
-Trust me, it wasn't expensive.

06:15.879 --> 06:21.480
ISABELLE: Golden boy,
I've been looking for you.

06:21.519 --> 06:22.800
Hi, Tara.

06:22.839 --> 06:23.560
-Hi.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.759
So you're back?

06:24.800 --> 06:26.560
-Yeah, exchange was nuts.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.680
The Russians massacre
you in technique class.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.199
Truth is, I actually
really missed

06:31.240 --> 06:33.040
this place while I was away.

06:33.079 --> 06:33.720
-Liar.

06:33.759 --> 06:35.319
You just missed me.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.439
-[laugh]

06:37.480 --> 06:38.279
-Oh, I'm sorry.

06:38.319 --> 06:39.480
Was there something you wanted?

06:39.519 --> 06:40.519
-Um, no.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.639
Um, I'll just see
you in detention.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.759
-Did something happen
with her while I was away.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.800
-No. [laugh] Well,
nothing serious.

06:53.839 --> 06:55.319
-You are such a player.

07:12.439 --> 07:13.160
-I said 6 o'clock.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.160
It's now 6:30.

07:16.199 --> 07:18.480
-Struggling to care.

07:18.519 --> 07:21.199
But you seem to have a
problem with me at the moment?

07:21.240 --> 07:22.319
Is it just PMS, or--

07:22.360 --> 07:24.399
-No, my problem is
that I'm the UN.

07:24.439 --> 07:25.040
OK?

07:25.079 --> 07:25.720
Kat blames Tara.

07:25.759 --> 07:26.600
Tara blames Kat.

07:26.639 --> 07:27.639
And guess who I blame?

07:31.120 --> 07:33.199
You didn't have to
send that photo.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.439
And if you're now
harassing Tara with them,

07:35.480 --> 07:36.439
well then, that's just--

07:36.480 --> 07:38.079
-What?

07:38.120 --> 07:40.120
Like I could be bothered
with the melodrama.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.839
So, where's my assignment?

07:46.879 --> 07:48.600
-Um, I'm not gonna
do it for you.

07:48.639 --> 07:50.759
I'll sit here with you
and I'll watch you do it.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.279
I'll give you some pointers.

07:52.319 --> 07:55.800
But if you're failing, you
need to do it by yourself.

07:55.839 --> 07:56.560
-Fine.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.639
Do you mind?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.560
If you're not going to help me,
I'd rather you didn't watch.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.439
It's kind of creepy.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.000
Run along.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.360
I'll be fine by myself.

08:26.079 --> 08:28.480
[giggling]

08:32.399 --> 08:35.159
-Are you OK?

08:35.200 --> 08:37.679
-You know, if this
was a movie, we'd

08:37.720 --> 08:39.759
have a water fight right now.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.200
-I-- I'm sorry, I should
got out with you why?

09:01.240 --> 09:03.480
-You can't deny there's
something between us.

09:03.519 --> 09:06.639
-Something other than your
sleaze and my casual loathing?

09:06.679 --> 09:10.120
-Look, Kat, you're sad.

09:10.159 --> 09:13.080
I think--- I know I
can make you happy.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.279
Look, don't say anything now.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.320
I'm gonna prove it to you.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.159
The wheels are in motion.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.200
-That was a proper declaration.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.720
-And I just couldn't
bring myself

09:23.759 --> 09:26.200
to kill the slobbery
hope in his eyes.

09:28.600 --> 09:33.320
-You know, I've never understood
the whole crush thing.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.600
What makes someone
behave that way?

09:35.639 --> 09:36.759
-That's my line.

09:36.799 --> 09:38.519
See, Tara would normally--

09:38.559 --> 09:40.600
PETRA: Would normally what?

09:40.639 --> 09:41.600
-Nothing.

09:41.639 --> 09:43.679
It's just-- it's
a relief I'm not

09:43.720 --> 09:45.200
obsessing over these things.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.639
PATRICK: And five,
six, seven, eight.

09:47.679 --> 09:51.559
[music playing]

09:51.600 --> 09:57.039
OK. "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," the star-crossed lovers.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.080
Kat, you're dancing Helena.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.279
Feisty, funny, and
betrothed to Sean.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.440
Except he's now in love
with your best friend,

10:05.480 --> 10:07.759
the sweet Hermia.

10:07.799 --> 10:10.399
-Hand to heart,
would never happen.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.159
-Hermia's in love
with Christian.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.320
And he feels the
same way about her.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.159
-Delightful.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.480
Somebody cue the vomit.

10:19.519 --> 10:20.679
-Who am I, sir?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.799
PATRICK: Puck, the one
who makes things worse

10:22.840 --> 10:24.159
before it gets better.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.360
-Now, that's typecasting.

10:25.399 --> 10:26.720
PATRICK: The point
to remember is

10:26.759 --> 10:28.720
that while most of the
ballet is about mixed signals

10:28.759 --> 10:33.399
and misunderstandings, in
the end, true love wins out.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.240
Good.

10:34.279 --> 10:36.279
Let's do it again, from the top.

10:41.720 --> 10:46.039
-Aha, on time and
the correct links.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.240
I should go in for match making.

10:48.279 --> 10:50.399
-Couldn't have done
it without him.

10:50.440 --> 10:58.039
-OK, noble dancers,
lend me your ears.

10:58.080 --> 11:01.720
We're continuing with your
Shakespeare immersion.

11:01.759 --> 11:07.120
I'm going to show you an excerpt
from a film, if I could just

11:07.159 --> 11:08.759
get this working.

11:08.799 --> 11:13.480
I want you to tell me how
it contrasts with the text.

11:13.519 --> 11:16.720
[laughter and whistling]

11:16.759 --> 11:18.159
What?

11:18.200 --> 11:22.519
OK, who put this in here?

11:22.559 --> 11:23.480
Thank you.

11:23.519 --> 11:24.799
Thank you.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.360
[laughter]

11:26.399 --> 11:30.039
Pay attention, because I don't
find this remotely funny.

11:30.080 --> 11:34.039
Bullying of any kind
will not be tolerated.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.039
-Training bra, can you wait?

11:37.080 --> 11:38.279
Can you just stop, please?

11:38.320 --> 11:39.799
-What do you want
from me, seriously?

11:39.840 --> 11:41.559
Go patch Kat.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.759
-That was a mistake, all right.

11:42.799 --> 11:43.519
-Whoever!

11:43.559 --> 11:44.240
I don't care.

11:44.279 --> 11:45.600
Just leave me alone.

11:45.639 --> 11:46.639
-No.

11:46.679 --> 11:47.799
-What?

11:47.840 --> 11:51.440
-No, I'm sick of
leaving you alone, Tara.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.159
Yeah, sure, you're probably
the most annoying person

11:54.200 --> 11:55.559
I've ever met.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.200
And most the time, I don't
even want to be around you.

11:59.240 --> 12:03.120
Then there's other times,
and you're the only person.

12:06.679 --> 12:08.279
And I like you.

12:12.879 --> 12:15.440
So yeah, ball's in your court.

12:26.639 --> 12:30.120
[music playing]

13:19.120 --> 13:20.759
-Must you lurk in the shadows?

13:24.679 --> 13:26.799
-So I read your essay.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.120
It's good, although
being your tutor,

13:30.159 --> 13:33.200
I would have advised you
to change a few more words.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.759
It's pretty easy to
see it was copied

13:34.799 --> 13:35.840
straight off the internet.

13:35.879 --> 13:37.600
-Well, it's not
like I had a choice.

13:37.639 --> 13:39.600
-You're blaming me?

13:39.639 --> 13:42.159
-Abigail, I'm about to get
down for cheating, because you

13:42.200 --> 13:43.799
couldn't be bothered
to do your own work.

13:43.840 --> 13:44.679
-Actually, I tried.

13:44.720 --> 13:45.840
-Yeah, right.

13:45.879 --> 13:47.399
-I couldn't do it.

13:47.440 --> 13:51.080
Look, I know my strengths,
and I know my weaknesses.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.320
And I'm fine with them.

13:52.360 --> 13:56.320
I put my energy into
what I'm good at.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.600
-But-- that's such a cop out.

14:00.639 --> 14:01.320
-Not really.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.720
You obviously think I'm stupid.

14:05.759 --> 14:08.399
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
checked to see if I cheated.

14:41.679 --> 14:43.200
-Uh, roommate?

14:43.240 --> 14:45.240
Come and put your
country skills to use.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.159
-So, when the bears drop?

14:58.200 --> 15:01.360
-Well, it's-- it's
more of a pounce.

15:01.399 --> 15:02.600
-Hey, Kat.

15:02.639 --> 15:04.480
-Kind of like that.

15:04.519 --> 15:05.720
-Hey, Sean.

15:05.759 --> 15:08.679
-So, um, have you thought
about what I asked?

15:08.720 --> 15:09.519
-Uh--

15:09.559 --> 15:10.919
-You have to stop.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.320
-Uh, excuse me, Sean and I
were having a conversation.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.480
-Look, I get that we'll
never be friends again,

15:15.519 --> 15:17.080
but you can't keep
attacking me with this.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.039
-Like I could be bothered!

15:18.080 --> 15:19.320
In my mind, you don't even--

15:19.360 --> 15:21.679
-Are you sure you want
to get involved in this.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.320
-She is beautiful
when she's mad.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.559
TARA: Well, it's
hard not to when

15:24.600 --> 15:26.080
you're waging a personal
vendetta against me!

15:26.120 --> 15:27.440
-Come on.

15:27.480 --> 15:31.080
[music playing]

15:39.279 --> 15:42.039
-Boys, remember, you're
both in love with Tara.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.720
She's the one you're
fighting over.

15:44.759 --> 15:46.200
-OK, Kat, you spot
what's happening,

15:46.240 --> 15:47.519
and you try to stop it.

15:59.399 --> 16:00.440
-I don't get it.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.240
I hurt Ethan, not you.

16:01.279 --> 16:04.320
-That's only part of it!

16:04.360 --> 16:05.720
-Then what's the other part?

16:05.759 --> 16:07.360
Do you like Christian
or something?

16:07.399 --> 16:08.120
-Oh, no.

16:08.159 --> 16:09.320
You're welcome to him.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.600
-OK, girls, come
back into the center.

16:11.639 --> 16:12.679
Bring some energy to it.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.159
-You have everything, and
you rub it in my face.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.320
-I'm so sick of that
self-righteous attitude!

16:26.360 --> 16:27.159
-Good, Tara.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.320
-I'm not self-righteous!

16:28.360 --> 16:30.159
-[grunt]

16:30.200 --> 16:31.360
-The problems aren't real.

16:31.399 --> 16:34.320
They just happen in your head.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.120
[scream]

16:35.159 --> 16:36.159
PATRICK: That's good, girls.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.360
Stay with the choreography.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.320
[fighting noises]

16:42.360 --> 16:43.639
Hey!

16:43.679 --> 16:46.399
Girls, listen.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.519
Tara, Katrina.

16:47.559 --> 16:48.399
[music stops]

16:48.440 --> 16:48.840
-Enough.

16:48.879 --> 16:50.559
Stand up.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.159
Katrina, you're on probation
and skating on very thin ice.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.159
And Tara, we gave you a
scholarship for a reason.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.120
This is no way to repay us.

16:58.159 --> 16:59.120
Get to the showers.

16:59.159 --> 17:00.399
Petra, can you please supervise?

17:03.360 --> 17:04.839
KAT: You forgot my birthday.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.160
-You left me stranded at the gig
so you could go off with Lucas.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.240
-He was my boyfriend and
all you did was judge him.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.319
-And how did that boyfriend
work out for you, Kat?

17:11.358 --> 17:12.559
Wasn't I right to judge him?

17:12.598 --> 17:14.480
-I can't believe you're
bringing that up now.

17:14.519 --> 17:17.240
Bottom line is you left
me, and I needed you.

17:17.279 --> 17:20.559
-Actually, the bottom line
is I'm sick of both of you.

17:20.598 --> 17:21.799
We all are.

17:21.839 --> 17:29.240
So I take these clothes hostage.

17:29.279 --> 17:30.480
-Petra?

17:30.519 --> 17:31.400
-Petra?

17:31.440 --> 17:32.599
-Petra?

17:32.640 --> 17:35.039
-Come back.

17:35.079 --> 17:37.160
-Wow, I've never seen
you with a pimple before.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.759
It's almost like a novelty.

17:38.799 --> 17:39.759
-It's a mosquito bit.

17:39.799 --> 17:41.400
Check your contact lenses.

17:41.440 --> 17:45.160
-Look, Abigail. [clears throat]
I don't-- I don't like you most

17:45.200 --> 17:47.519
of the time, but I definitely
don't think you're stupid.

17:47.559 --> 17:48.960
-Out of my way, Lieberman.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.480
-I think you're scared of
trying, which-- it doesn't make

17:50.519 --> 17:51.799
any sense, because you're
about to go out there and be

17:51.839 --> 17:52.480
fearless.

17:54.839 --> 17:55.440
Look.

17:58.319 --> 18:00.680
In a billion years,
I could never

18:00.720 --> 18:03.799
be as brilliant as you are.

18:03.839 --> 18:07.079
-Yeah, but you
just mean dancing.

18:07.119 --> 18:10.759
-No, I-- I kind of
mean everything.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.440
PATRICK: Abigail, your entrance.

stepping on my toes!

18:27.839 --> 18:29.039
KAT: Well, I need more room!

18:29.079 --> 18:32.519
TARA: Well, there
isn't more room.

18:32.559 --> 18:33.559
-[squeal]

18:38.200 --> 18:38.839
-Ah, great.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.720
This is the boys' side.

18:39.759 --> 18:40.599
-It doesn't matter.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.759
We just need clothes.

18:42.799 --> 18:44.200
-Down, down.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.519
-Down. [grunt] Oh, it's Sean's.

18:47.559 --> 18:48.359
I can smell it.

18:52.240 --> 18:52.559
Here.

19:01.519 --> 19:03.160
Told you it wasn't me.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.640
-But why would Sean?

19:04.680 --> 19:08.119
--[sigh] It would seem he has
a rather large crush on me.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.200
His idea of a romantic gesture?

19:10.240 --> 19:11.400
-Like a proper one?

19:11.440 --> 19:12.599
Do you think he's
fantasizing about you?

19:12.640 --> 19:14.519
Because a Sean fantasy
could mean anything.

19:14.559 --> 19:15.279
-Anything!

19:15.319 --> 19:16.400
I know, right. [laugh]

19:16.440 --> 19:18.240
-And what if he's
got the GPS going?

19:18.279 --> 19:21.640
There'll be, like,
no place to hide.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.519
What?

19:23.559 --> 19:24.200
-Nothing.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.359
I know you don't think
my problems are real.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.359
-I think--

19:40.400 --> 19:42.200
-Listen.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.599
But they're mine.

19:43.640 --> 19:49.319
And I guess I've just
been pretty unhappy lately

19:49.359 --> 19:50.480
about what I'm doing here.

19:50.519 --> 19:52.200
-You should have told me.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.400
-I think I wanted you to ask.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.200
And it-- it kind of
just feels like you

20:00.240 --> 20:06.119
put everything ahead of me--
ballet and guys, which is cool,

20:06.160 --> 20:09.799
because you don't need me.

20:09.839 --> 20:14.319
But the thing is, I need you.

20:21.519 --> 20:23.799
-So how did Natasha
take the party?

20:23.839 --> 20:25.359
Was there a fallout?

20:25.400 --> 20:26.000
-Major.

20:26.039 --> 20:27.319
She went ballistic.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.720
-Hey, you're wearing my clothes.

20:37.759 --> 20:39.279
We're practically married.

20:39.319 --> 20:40.359
-Mm.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.480
I sense we might be
getting a divorce.

20:42.519 --> 20:43.799
-Really?

20:43.839 --> 20:44.720
Bad call?

20:44.759 --> 20:45.640
-Mhm.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.640
Burn them.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.119
-Hey, do you have a minute?

20:51.160 --> 20:52.119
KAT: That's it.

20:52.160 --> 21:03.799
Burn them all Mhm.

21:03.839 --> 21:05.240
That one, too.

21:05.279 --> 21:09.799
-So I've been thinking a
lot about what you said,

21:09.839 --> 21:13.559
and I like you, too.

21:13.599 --> 21:14.759
But only as a friend.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.519
-A friend?

21:21.880 --> 21:24.640
I've put it out there
a couple of times now.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.400
-I know.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.200
-I'm not going to
be doing that again.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.599
-I know that, too.

21:34.839 --> 21:35.440
-OK.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.839
-It's not perfect.

22:09.880 --> 22:10.480
I couldn't put it
through spell check.

22:10.519 --> 22:11.160
-Sh.

22:14.319 --> 22:16.559
-Ah, interesting, there.

22:16.599 --> 22:17.400
-OK, give it back.

22:17.440 --> 22:17.720
-Ah.

22:27.759 --> 22:29.160
Discussing it.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.680
It's another thing
you're brilliant at.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.640
[laugh]

22:33.680 --> 22:35.119
-Really?

22:35.160 --> 22:36.799
'Cause I've never
written an essay before.

-Come with me.

spend a lot of my life

wishing it was more like a
Choose Your Own Adventure book.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.200
-It made me think of you.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.799
TARA (VOICEOVER): And if I don't
like how something turns out,

23:13.839 --> 23:15.799
I can just flip backwards
and do it again.

23:15.839 --> 23:16.799
-What are you doing?

23:16.839 --> 23:18.720
Tara, we're just looking.

23:18.759 --> 23:22.279
TARA (VOICEOVER): Of course, in
real life, that's impossible.

23:22.319 --> 23:23.759
You have to live
with consequences.

23:26.359 --> 23:28.279
I never looked
after another lamb.

23:28.319 --> 23:32.160
But three weeks later, I adopted
a joey-- the first of many.

And I have always
remember to shut the gate.
