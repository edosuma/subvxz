17:36.823 --> 17:39.192
Now I guess we just have
to banish the demon

17:39.226 --> 17:41.361
out of his body.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.296
Doesn't really say
where we should put it though.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.864
There's just an 800 number
on the back.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.734
W-well, Quinn, this church
seems sort of pyramid scheme-y.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.737
Well, tell that to the 14 people
that I had sign up for it.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.539
You're already too late!

17:52.572 --> 17:54.774
So, he's definitely awake now.
Here we go. All right.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.378
Okay, Mr. Demon,
my name is Geoffrey Quinn.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.748
I know you are, whore,
and you, fallen angel.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.151
Okay, well, I think he might
have got those mixed up there.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.752
Really, Quinn?
Because I'm a woman?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.787
Not all women
are whores, all right?

18:07.820 --> 18:10.623
I'm not the one being
exorcised here, Abbey, okay?

18:10.657 --> 18:11.924
Just get a Bible.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.827
Uh, Mr. Demon,
what is your true name,

18:14.861 --> 18:17.164
or should I just
call you Mr. Weepy?

18:17.197 --> 18:19.132
-I can only whisper it.
-I'm making contact.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.901
-Okay.
-Come down here.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.002
Oh, my God!

18:23.035 --> 18:24.837
Abbey, how are we doing
with the Bible?!

18:24.871 --> 18:27.674
-They're all full of [bleep]!
-Just like your mother!

18:27.707 --> 18:29.809
Mary Elizabeth Quinn
was a saint.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.010
You take it back!

18:31.043 --> 18:33.346
Abbey, just bring
whatever you got!

18:33.380 --> 18:35.515
They're all desecrated.
I don't think it's gonna work.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.451
Like your womb?

18:38.485 --> 18:40.553
Oh, [ Chuckling ]

18:42.054 --> 18:45.992
So many...[bleep].
Where's the chapter on exorcism?

18:46.025 --> 18:47.994
Just say anything!
Did you know any prayers?

18:48.027 --> 18:52.299
Um! As I walk
through the valley

18:52.332 --> 18:55.335
of the shadow of death,
I take a look at my life

18:55.368 --> 18:57.704
and realize
that nothing's left,

18:57.737 --> 18:59.839
because I've been
blasting and laughing

18:59.872 --> 19:03.343
so long that even my Mama
thinks that my mind is gone.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.278
Are you saying the lyrics
to "Gangsta's Paradise"?!

19:05.312 --> 19:06.713
Yeah, "Dangerous Minds"
was the only movie

19:06.746 --> 19:08.047
that they let us
watch in prison.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.882
Just use the holy water!

19:09.916 --> 19:12.485
Fine!!

19:14.587 --> 19:15.888
What are you doing?

19:15.922 --> 19:19.559
I'm drinking the water!
I'm parched, Abbey!

19:19.592 --> 19:23.162
Take that, demon!
You take it!

19:23.196 --> 19:25.064
How do you like that,
demon?

19:25.097 --> 19:26.633
Refreshing, fatty!

19:26.666 --> 19:29.536
We're gonna have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.037
Careful, I'm ticklish.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.240
Ahh!!

19:33.273 --> 19:34.707
You know, I...

19:34.741 --> 19:36.243
There's no easy way
to say this,

19:36.276 --> 19:38.511
so I'm just gonna come
right out with it --

19:38.545 --> 19:39.846
Your mother is dead.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.748
-What?
-Yeah.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.389
H-how'd she die?
It it 'cause her arm fell off?

19:49.422 --> 19:50.923
No. I guess --

19:50.957 --> 19:53.192
'Cause that's how
her mother died.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.827
Really?

19:54.861 --> 19:58.998
Well, anyway, I just want you
to know that my feelings

19:59.031 --> 20:01.268
for your mother
were very deep,

20:01.301 --> 20:03.770
and I'm sorry that it
went down like this.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.105
It could have been worse.

20:06.138 --> 20:09.208
I thought syphilis was gonna
take her out years ago.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.444
-Syphilis?
-She liked you, Shoemaker.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.912
She really did.

20:12.945 --> 20:18.217
And I want to thank you for
giving the old gal one last...

20:18.251 --> 20:20.119
one last hurrah.
-Well, I want to let you know

20:20.152 --> 20:22.389
that I was very fond
of her, too, Rod.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.257
Now, what do we do?
Do we call someone,

20:24.291 --> 20:26.393
do we make arrangements,
or --

20:26.426 --> 20:28.961
No, my family -- We bury them
where they fall --

20:28.995 --> 20:30.897
Knorr family tradition.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.265
He's gonna escape!

20:32.299 --> 20:34.367
The power of Christ
compels you!

20:34.401 --> 20:36.068
No one likes you, Quinn,

20:36.102 --> 20:40.139
especially not
your best friend Loren!

20:40.172 --> 20:41.408
Quinn,
don't listen to him.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.975
He's just trying to fill your
head with lies --

20:43.009 --> 20:44.076
with half-truths.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.979
Half-truths, like
your Bumble profile,

20:47.013 --> 20:48.214
like going rock climbing

20:48.247 --> 20:50.483
and getting 'Potle
with your girls?

20:50.517 --> 20:52.051
-How do you know that?!
-Everyone knows!

20:52.084 --> 20:54.587
We talk about it
and laugh and laugh!

20:54.621 --> 20:55.955
All right,
let's kill him!

20:55.988 --> 20:58.458
Hey...
let me ask you something.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.992
Did you know
that Doris had syphilis?

21:00.026 --> 21:02.061
Yeah, everybody knew that.
I put it in my Yelp review.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.496
You think you could
have told me that?

21:03.530 --> 21:04.397
[ Cellphone vibrating ]

21:04.431 --> 21:05.965
What is that now?

21:05.998 --> 21:08.335
It's a message
from you asking me

21:08.368 --> 21:10.737
if I want anything
from the Bucks.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.339
Wait, are you still
on Cricket Wireless?

21:12.372 --> 21:13.840
That's from, like,
five hours ago.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.141
Yeah, I mean, I was gonna
get rid of it,

21:15.174 --> 21:17.577
but the rates are --
That's --

21:17.610 --> 21:18.845
That's it!
That's what's going on.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.313
That's where the delayed
text messages

21:20.347 --> 21:22.315
from Doris are coming from.
-It's actually funny, kind of.

21:22.349 --> 21:25.017
That is funny, if you take
away the dog viciously...

21:25.051 --> 21:26.353
-Yeah, that's funny.
... dismembering her.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.522
Sorry, and then --

21:29.556 --> 21:30.423
What is that?

21:30.457 --> 21:32.158
No! Take it back!

21:32.191 --> 21:34.694
Hey, what the hell
is going on in here?

21:34.727 --> 21:35.962
Loren! You came back
for me.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.364
No, I just heard
a scream in here.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.665
I didn't even know
you were in here at all.

21:38.698 --> 21:39.866
Uh, we're kind
of busy right now.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.167
Fairbell's possessed.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.935
Possessed?
No he's not.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.472
What self-respecting demon
would want him as a host?

21:45.505 --> 21:48.841
Stay out of it, Shoemaker!
No one respects you anyway.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.478
You're wife,
your kid, your band --

21:51.511 --> 21:53.846
Face it, you're the un-loved!

21:53.880 --> 21:55.515
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:55.548 --> 21:57.617
You talked to my son?
How -- How is he?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.519
Okay, let me talk
to Fairbell for a minute.

21:59.552 --> 22:00.887
Buddy, you got
to chill out.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.722
Right, like I want
to take any advice

22:02.755 --> 22:06.292
from the guy who
hasn't been laid in 18 months!

22:06.325 --> 22:08.628
He's talking crazy.
That was a secret!

22:08.661 --> 22:10.797
I found the exorcism prayer,
but it's in Latin.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.065
Well, this sounds
like a job for a History --

22:13.099 --> 22:16.035

I'll take that.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.327
-Oh, my God!
-Ahh! Ahh!

Ahh!

[ Screaming ]
Oh, my God!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.101
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.503
It's everywhere.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.871
Fairbell:
This is so much better.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.906
Sometimes you just have
to get it out of system, right?

22:53.940 --> 22:56.543
Oh, God.
Just all out.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.611
I'm hungry.
-God, Fairbell.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.880
Oh, wait -- is this
my café vanano coffee?

23:00.913 --> 23:04.050
Uh, yeah, why? How much
of this stuff did you drink?

23:04.083 --> 23:06.453
I don't know.
I've never drank coffee before.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.755
I just started drinking
and then I kept drinking

23:08.788 --> 23:09.922
and then my brain
got all fuzzy.
Oh, my God.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.357
Abbey,
what is wrong with you?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.760
Oh, I will take your criticisms
of my life choices

23:13.793 --> 23:15.394
when you finally
get laid.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.063
18 months?
I mean, that is so sad!

23:17.096 --> 23:19.065
Hey, I have had two
HJs during that time --

23:19.098 --> 23:20.900
two, okay?
-Even sadder!

23:20.933 --> 23:23.570
Enough is enough, all right?
We still have to figure out

23:23.603 --> 23:25.538
who painted this
pentagrams, okay?

23:25.572 --> 23:29.576
I did.
I drew the pentagrams.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.310
Oh, that's very funny,
Phil.

23:31.343 --> 23:32.945
This is a very
serious situation.

I'm also
a practicing Satanist.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.783
Oh right.
That is a good one.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.652
No, really. Our motto is
"Do what thou wilt,"

23:39.686 --> 23:42.455
and I wilted drawing
a bunch pentagrams.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.991
See, Shoemaker? He's way funnier
than you'd think.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.594
I -- Okay.
Yeah. I see it now.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.761
-Exactly.
-Uh-huh.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.730
You know what,
maybe this is one of those,

just give me your cameras.

Yeah, me too.
Hey, here's an idea --

Maybe we should just
destroy all this footage

24:16.856 --> 24:18.491
and forget this night
ever happened.
