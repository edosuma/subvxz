WEBVTT

00:03.370 --> 00:05.070
(snores, gasps)

00:06.339 --> 00:08.240
Oh, my God, the
alarm didn't go off!

00:08.275 --> 00:09.708
Get up! Get up! Get up!

00:09.743 --> 00:11.643
(stammers): Uh,
it's a chicken. What?

00:11.678 --> 00:13.211
What? What happened?
We overslept.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.713
It's almost 8:00.
Just get dressed.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.582
I'll wake up the kids
and-and get 'em in the shower.

00:17.617 --> 00:18.617
Oh, there's no time.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.718
I'll just Febreze 'em.

00:19.753 --> 00:20.652
Ugh.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.623
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.626
Okay. Okay.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.729
Okay. Hold on.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.431
ANDI:
Okay, kids,

00:32.466 --> 00:33.532
let's move it, okay?

00:33.567 --> 00:34.699
Babe, why are you
still in bed?

00:34.734 --> 00:35.734
Hurry up!

00:37.204 --> 00:40.072
Wait, wait, wait.
It's Saturday!

00:40.107 --> 00:41.640
Seriously?

00:41.675 --> 00:43.175
Yeah.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.843
Wow. Awesome.

00:44.878 --> 00:48.713
Okay. Hey!
It's Saturday!

00:48.748 --> 00:51.249
Everybody back to sleep!
False alarm!

00:51.284 --> 00:53.819
Oh! Ugh.
Okay.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.520
Oh.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.222
(both sigh)

00:57.257 --> 00:58.757
Oh, this is nice.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.192
So nice.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.626
(door opens)

01:01.661 --> 01:04.196
My game starts
in 20 minutes.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.699
(sighs)

01:07.734 --> 01:10.168
You said having kids
would be fun.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.671
I said<i> making</i> kids
would be fun.

01:15.709 --> 01:19.812
(gasps) Oh, he's so cute.
Look at those cheeks.

01:20.847 --> 01:21.746
Hey.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.782
Adam, look, a baby.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.784
ADAM:
Oh...

01:25.819 --> 01:26.751
Hey, is that Parker?

01:26.786 --> 01:28.186
ANDI:
Yeah, we're finally

01:28.221 --> 01:29.788
getting to meet
Don and Marcy's grandson.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.490
DON: Mikey and
his girlfriend

01:31.525 --> 01:33.725
dropped him off for the week
on their way to a wedding.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.862
Not their wedding, but I guess
anything goes these days.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.832
We're gonna get you
secretly baptized, aren't we?

01:40.867 --> 01:41.700
Oh, he is cute, huh?

01:41.735 --> 01:43.135
Yeah.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.237
And he's finally
growing into his ears.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.139
When he was born, he looked
like a fruit bat. (chuckles)

01:47.174 --> 01:49.608
I think he's adorable.

01:50.677 --> 01:52.210
Oh, man, this brings me back.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.646
It does?

01:54.681 --> 01:55.881
Oh. (sniffs)

01:55.916 --> 01:58.316
Why can't they make that
into a candle?

01:58.351 --> 01:59.851
(chuckles)
You want a hit?

01:59.886 --> 02:01.586
Well... (sniffs)

02:01.621 --> 02:03.388
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's great.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.223
Babies are awesome,
such little angels.

02:05.258 --> 02:08.160
Can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a minute?

02:10.497 --> 02:11.897
You have to get
Parker out of here!

02:11.932 --> 02:13.732
If Andi spends one
more minute with him,

02:13.767 --> 02:15.500
she's gonna want
a baby of her own.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.235
Isn't she too old
for a baby?

02:17.270 --> 02:20.872
Shh! Are you trying
to get us killed?

02:20.907 --> 02:23.642
Oh, I'm sorry. Marcy talks
about menopause all the time.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.610
She's already having
hot flashes at night.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.779
It's like sleeping next to
a moody campfire.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.915
(timer dings)
What was that?

02:29.950 --> 02:33.952
Bottle time, which also
reminds me that it's time for...

02:33.987 --> 02:36.221
my bottle.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.524
So did you decide
what he's gonna call you?

02:39.559 --> 02:41.359
Nana? Grammy?
Oh, no.

02:41.394 --> 02:43.695
No, no. Those are grandma
names and I'm no grandma.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.764
I'm just someone whose son
happened to have a baby

02:45.799 --> 02:47.432
with a woman he met
on the Internet.

02:47.467 --> 02:48.934
(chuckles)

02:48.969 --> 02:51.870
Okay, Andi, give the baby back
to Marcy so she can feed him.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.538
Oh, no. I want
to feed him.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.974
No, you need to keep your
hands free for drinking wine

02:56.009 --> 02:58.843
or some other fun thing you
can't do when you have a baby.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.812
Should we take
up smoking?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.647
Okay, Adam,
I know what you're thinking,

03:02.682 --> 03:04.649
but I am done having babies.

03:04.684 --> 03:05.516
Really?

03:05.552 --> 03:08.220
Yeah. You don't have to
worry about me.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.487
Okay, good.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.789
Isn't that right?

03:10.824 --> 03:13.758
Aunt Andi's done having babies.
Yes, she is.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.794
Yes, she is.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.330
(laughing):
Oh.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.799
I don't know about you,
but I'm not sure I believe her.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.338
Okay. You want to watch
the animal channel

03:26.373 --> 03:27.839
or the food channel?

03:27.874 --> 03:30.609
It's kind of
a before and after thing.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.943
Let's go with animals.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.712
Okay.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.250
Ugh. I've seen this one.

03:38.285 --> 03:40.752
Don't get too attached
to that antelope.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.292
I want another baby.

03:57.470 --> 03:59.871
Â¶ Â¶

04:07.714 --> 04:09.281
You want to have
a fourth kid?

04:09.316 --> 04:14.452
Who has four kids?
What are we, dogs?

04:14.487 --> 04:18.323
I have thought this
through logically.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.558
First off...

04:20.593 --> 04:23.295
did you see
his tiny toes? Oh!

04:23.463 --> 04:25.363
I just wanted to
bite 'em right off.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.300
Hmm. Well, why don't
you bite the toes

04:28.335 --> 04:29.701
off the kids
we have now?

04:29.736 --> 04:32.771
I'll tell you why:
because they stink.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.940
Come on.
Don't you remember

04:35.975 --> 04:38.310
when we found out
I was pregnant with Kate?

04:38.345 --> 04:40.545
You were over the moon.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.682
Adam?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.350
Yeah, babe?

04:47.754 --> 04:50.722
Two blue lines. We did it.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.557
I am the man!

04:52.592 --> 04:55.994
(Adam whoops, laughs)

04:56.029 --> 04:58.630
Yes, that was a
magical moment,

04:58.665 --> 05:00.799
but do you remember
the next one?

05:00.834 --> 05:03.001
(laughs):
Ooh. Huh?

05:06.072 --> 05:08.473
Two blue lines.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.076
When did we have time
to do that?

05:11.111 --> 05:13.445
Daylight Savings,
when we fell back.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.380
That's what we did
with that hour.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.783
And then, there
was the last one.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.518
(Kate and Teddy screaming)
No run... no running.

05:20.553 --> 05:21.953
I'm gonna get you!
No running.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.521
No running.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.923
I'm gonna get you!
No running.

05:24.958 --> 05:25.957
(screams)
No running.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.125
I was gonna get you!

05:27.160 --> 05:29.594
(Kate and Teddy laughing)

05:33.099 --> 05:34.733
(sighs)

05:34.768 --> 05:36.802
Mm-hmm.

05:38.938 --> 05:41.973
And we never slept again.

05:43.676 --> 05:47.746
Okay. What if we started
sleeping now and banked it?

05:47.781 --> 05:51.583
Huh? That is nine months
of sleep, my friend.

05:51.618 --> 05:54.853
Babe, you know
I love our kids,

05:54.888 --> 05:56.755
but I also love
thinking of a time

05:56.790 --> 05:58.123
when they are
out of the house

05:58.158 --> 06:00.024
and I can lavish
all of my attention

06:00.059 --> 06:02.026
on you, my
beautiful bride.

06:02.061 --> 06:05.964
Huh? Think of the flowers
and... and massages.

06:05.999 --> 06:09.401
Huh? It'll be like
living on a cloud.

06:09.436 --> 06:12.570
I don't want to live
on a cloud. I want a baby.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.840
Okay, I didn't want to
have to put my foot down

06:15.875 --> 06:17.575
like this, but...

06:17.610 --> 06:20.979
we can't fit another cubby!

06:21.014 --> 06:24.682
I just... I feel like I have
so much more love to give.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.451
Give it to me!

06:26.486 --> 06:29.120
Honey, we're barely
keeping our heads above water

06:29.155 --> 06:33.692
with the three we have.
So, no more babies, okay?

06:34.727 --> 06:35.860
We'll see.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.496
No. No, no.
No, no. (laughs)

06:38.531 --> 06:43.034
No. I need you to say,
"I hear you and I agree."

06:44.204 --> 06:46.671
I hear you...
and we'll see.

06:46.706 --> 06:47.605
Well...

06:47.641 --> 06:51.109
"We'll see" is how
we got the first three!

06:53.947 --> 06:56.481
Andi still have
baby fever?
(scoffs) Yeah.

06:56.516 --> 06:57.982
She's singing lullabies
in the shower.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.851
And she's no Barbra Streisand.

06:59.886 --> 07:02.487
Yeah, things aren't great
at my house, either.

07:02.522 --> 07:05.457
Marcy's in a tailspin
about being a grandma.
Mm.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.459
There's been talk
of a facelift.

07:07.494 --> 07:08.626
Really?

07:08.661 --> 07:10.528
Yeah. I mean,
I have a hard enough time

07:10.563 --> 07:11.729
reading her moods as it is.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.632
If they freeze her face in
one expression, I'm a dead man.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.535
I am in big trouble.
Andi wants to have another baby.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.238
And she knows I like doing
the thing you do to make a baby.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.974
So, make yourself
less appealing to her.

07:23.009 --> 07:25.810
Hey, I hear
the McRib is back.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.879
Put away a few of those
and you'll be sleeping alone.

07:27.914 --> 07:29.481
Please. I could
be covered

07:29.516 --> 07:32.250
in barbecue sauce
and she'd still be all over me.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.686
You got a real
special woman there.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.824
(sighs)

07:39.859 --> 07:41.726
Hey, baby.
Hey, what...?

07:41.761 --> 07:43.028
Mmm.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.965
Wow. You're not wasting
any time, are you?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.600
What?

07:48.635 --> 07:51.236
Can't a wife welcome her husband
home after a long day?

07:51.271 --> 07:52.971
Yeah, but-- ooh. Yeah.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.807
But that's-that's... that's
not what you're doing.

07:55.842 --> 07:57.976
Okay, I think I...
Kids, get in here!

07:58.011 --> 08:01.279
You can't manhandle me like that
in front of the kids. (laughs)

08:01.314 --> 08:02.981
The kids are at your parents'.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.083
They're dropping them off
in the morning.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.217
Oh.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.253
Uh-oh. (chuckles)

08:11.057 --> 08:13.057
Guess we're alone.

08:13.092 --> 08:14.659
Uh...

08:14.694 --> 08:17.562
What to do? What to do?

08:20.333 --> 08:23.101
Uh, I had three McRibs
for lunch!

08:24.137 --> 08:26.104
I don't care.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.106
Well, I knew you wouldn't,
'cause you're all

08:28.141 --> 08:29.908
jacked up
on lady hormones.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.576
Okay, right, okay, fine.
You know what?

08:31.611 --> 08:33.177
You-you-you leave
me no choice.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.179
I'm shutting down the
factory. That's right.

08:35.214 --> 08:39.117
Me and my employees
are going on strike.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.886
Okay.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.055
Mm-hmm.
Well...

08:44.090 --> 08:46.057
I know your employees...

08:46.092 --> 08:48.927
and I can get a couple of 'em
to cross the picket line.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.161
No, no. No!

08:50.196 --> 08:52.030
That's why I'm running.
No, no! No!

08:52.065 --> 08:54.566
Honey, not that.
Not a good idea!

08:57.303 --> 08:58.302
(sighs)

09:02.175 --> 09:04.109
Hello, muscles.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.012
(tambourine jangles)

09:08.047 --> 09:10.048
(chuckles)
What's with the tambourine?

09:11.050 --> 09:13.017
You shake it,
I'll dance.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.286
We'll see where it leads.

09:15.855 --> 09:18.122
I'm gonna say straight
to the mental hospital.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.824
(tambourine jangles)

09:19.859 --> 09:21.159
(sniffs)

09:21.194 --> 09:22.827
What's that smell?
Is that a new perfume?

09:22.862 --> 09:26.731
It's French.
It's called FertilitÃ©.

09:26.766 --> 09:30.101
Okay, you're... you're really
starting to freak me out.

09:30.136 --> 09:33.171
Sweetie, this
is happening.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.873
So, give me my baby!
Well...

09:35.908 --> 09:38.176
No, no, no!
You... keep your hands

09:38.211 --> 09:40.579
and your sex tambourine
away from me!

09:45.184 --> 09:46.718
(door opens)

09:53.926 --> 09:55.293
What are you wearing?

09:55.328 --> 09:57.829
Seven pairs of sweatpants.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.297
That's right.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.232
You're never gonna find
what you're looking for.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.202
(grunts) Oh.
And even if you do,

10:04.237 --> 10:08.673
it will have been under
seven pairs of sweatpants.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.009
(sighs)

10:11.044 --> 10:13.144
Doesn't bother me.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.213
I'll peel you
like an onion.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.858
Hey.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.627
No, you keep your distance!

10:30.263 --> 10:33.398
Okay, I admit that last night
was not my proudest moment.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.066
Yeah.
But can I... can I
please explain my crazy?

10:35.101 --> 10:37.201
No. No. One more step,

10:37.236 --> 10:39.037
and you're getting the mustard.

10:39.072 --> 10:43.775
Look, I'm just saying,
we're not getting any younger.

10:43.810 --> 10:47.045
So, if we want to have
another baby, it's now or never.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.280
We got to get this one in
before the buzzer.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.250
What buzzer?
You know,

10:52.285 --> 10:54.752
like at a basketball game, when
the guy hits the winning shot

10:54.787 --> 10:58.122
right before the buzzer,
crowd goes wild.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.992
You could be that guy, Adam.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.929
You could be the buzzer beater.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.267
Honey, I can't go back
to baby time again.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.469
We just got Emme into
school full-time.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.738
You're back to work,
which you love.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.740
Things are good.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.910
I know. I mean,
intellectually, I get that.

11:18.945 --> 11:22.180
But my baby-maker's all,
"Give me, give me, give me."

11:22.215 --> 11:25.016
Yeah, I hear it.
The neighbors hear it.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.186
I'm sorry, but I
think we're perfect.

11:28.221 --> 11:33.191
We don't need some Yoko Ono
coming in and ruining the band.

11:33.226 --> 11:37.429
Okay? So, please,
no baby, okay?

11:38.498 --> 11:41.032
Well, we do have
a great band.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.202
Okay.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.403
Okay?

11:45.438 --> 11:46.370
Okay.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.239
Okay.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.307
I'm ready for school.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.508
And-and if you
think about it,

11:50.543 --> 11:52.110
we have a baby.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.011
I mean, you can still
pick this one up.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.346
Huh? And you
can do this.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.117
Huh?

11:59.152 --> 12:02.420
And you can do this.
(kissing)

12:02.455 --> 12:04.155
You didn't brush
your teeth.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.958
Go brush your teeth.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.961
Hey, uh, why is there a
giant pile of sweatpants

12:09.996 --> 12:11.262
in the bathroom?

12:11.297 --> 12:14.966
Oh, um...

12:15.001 --> 12:17.268
Daddy was hiding
something from me.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.174
All right, Emme, let's
bring it in for some kisses.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.343
Daddy, not in front
of my friends.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.212
What? Well, you
kissed me yesterday.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.781
Yeah, but I'm older now.

12:29.816 --> 12:32.183
Come on. Just one kiss.
Right here, come on.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.818
I'm not a baby anymore.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.823
Bye.

12:38.858 --> 12:39.891
Ouch.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.159
That's the first time

12:41.194 --> 12:42.894
I've ever felt sorry
for you, Burns.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.062
Huh, it's already gone.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.233
If it helps, you have a coupon
from me for one free hug.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.103
Expiration date: never.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.115
Andi, it's me. Meet me at home.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.351
We're making a baby!

13:10.122 --> 13:11.322
You ready?

13:11.357 --> 13:12.290
Feeling strong.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.396
(whoops, sighs)

13:18.431 --> 13:20.298
Whew. Wow.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.133
That was intense.

13:22.168 --> 13:25.436
Yeah, we shouldn't have run
up the stairs like that.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.972
Yes, let's take a minute
to catch our breath,

13:28.007 --> 13:30.074
and then we are
making a baby.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.176
All right.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.854
You know,
I got to say,

13:42.889 --> 13:44.956
what we've been doing
the past few days,

13:44.991 --> 13:47.058
that is gonna make a baby.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.529
I am really happy
about this.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.164
Me, too, babe.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.633
And it turned out the
tambourine was fun.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.035
Yeah, yeah, we should
keep that in the repertoire.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.605
Ooh, Teddy has a ukulele
if you ever want to do

14:00.640 --> 14:03.074
a Hawaiian night.
Ooh.

14:03.109 --> 14:03.908
(door opens)

14:03.943 --> 14:05.076
Hey, guys,

14:05.111 --> 14:06.010
we have to cancel dinner
tonight.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.211
(door closes)

14:07.246 --> 14:08.045
Parker's killing us.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.614
I thought I was
high-maintenance.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.616
I can't stop moving
or he squawks.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.417
My calf muscles
are on fire.

14:13.452 --> 14:14.886
MARCY: We haven't
slept in days.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.187
I mean, look at me.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.588
I know what
you're doing.

14:17.623 --> 14:20.091
You are trying to turn
me into a grandma.

14:21.327 --> 14:24.929
Well, I'm-I'm sure
you've had some fun, too, right?

14:24.964 --> 14:27.265
Did you, uh...
did you take him to the park?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.432
I used to love
pushing the kids

14:28.467 --> 14:30.101
on the swings
when they were babies.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.136
Please. How many times can
I pretend to be surprised

14:32.171 --> 14:33.537
when he swings
back to me?

14:33.572 --> 14:35.373
The answer's five.
Five times.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.075
DON: Okay, come on.
We got to keep moving.
Oh.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.644
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Let me
smell him, let me smell him.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.113
(sniffs) Oh, that's not
the good baby smell.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.047
All right, we'll have to

14:43.083 --> 14:44.949
change him when we
get to the duck pond.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.084
We were saving the duck
pond for tomorrow.

14:47.119 --> 14:48.286
If we don't get through
the next two hours,

14:48.321 --> 14:50.488
there is
no tomorrow.
(groans)

14:50.523 --> 14:51.956
(door closes)

14:51.991 --> 14:53.190
Wow.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.659
(chuckles):
Yeah.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.028
That kid's giving 'em
a run for their money.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.330
Well, you know, Don and Marcy
don't know what they're doing.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.198
You know, 'cause
they only had one kid.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.401
We had three,
so we're pros.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.069
Totally.
Yeah.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.637
And our baby is
gonna be an angel.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.706
That one just sounds
completely unreasonable.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.043
Yeah, well, if you had to hang
around Don's neck all day,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.045
you'd have
some complaints, too.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.080
(chuckles) I mean, you think
he takes that thing off

15:16.115 --> 15:17.715
when he goes to the bathroom?
I don't. (chuckles)

15:17.750 --> 15:18.683
(chuckles)
Right?

15:18.718 --> 15:21.218
Yeah.
(chuckles)
Yeah.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.221
(chuckles)
Yeah.
(chuckles)

15:29.295 --> 15:31.262
(sighs)

15:31.297 --> 15:35.099
I'm not sure I want
to have another baby.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.034
Oh, thank God.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.502
I'm not sure, too.
Really?

15:38.537 --> 15:40.738
I-I had just been blocking
out all the bad stuff.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.108
And then, seeing Don and Marcy
made it all come flooding back.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.210
You know, the-the
sleepless nights...

15:46.245 --> 15:47.178
The endless days.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.180
Endless poops.
Yeah, plus,

15:49.215 --> 15:51.182
remember how much time
you spend on the floor

15:51.217 --> 15:53.751
when you have a baby?
I can't do that anymore.

15:53.786 --> 15:58.122
I'll be down there till the
kid's old enough to help me up.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.457
Well, that's a
great point.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.125
The other day, I
dropped a strawberry

16:01.160 --> 16:02.593
and just kicked it
under the fridge.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.462
We can't have a new baby.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.064
'Cause you know it'll find
that thing and eat it!

16:07.099 --> 16:09.200
They get into everything.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.068
BOTH:
Baby proofing.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.304
(groans) The gate
on the stairs,

16:13.339 --> 16:14.672
the locked cabinets.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.174
You got to be freaking Houdini
to get a bag of chips.

16:17.209 --> 16:20.378
Okay, okay, well, there's a
good chance I'm not pregnant.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.614
I don't know. I don't miss.
I'm three-for-three.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.616
Yeah, well,
that's true.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.520
Okay, we'll go and get a
pregnancy test in the morning.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.355
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.224
It's pouring rain.
It-it can wait till the morning.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.094
Okay.
(sighs)

16:38.097 --> 16:39.463
We're gonna
go now, right?

16:39.498 --> 16:41.432
Yeah, my feet are already
on the floor.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.801
(thunder claps)

16:43.836 --> 16:45.236
ANDI:
Oh.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.206
Hey, can you tell us
where to find...

16:49.241 --> 16:51.209
Laxatives, aisle four.

16:53.212 --> 16:54.011
What?

16:54.046 --> 16:56.247
Yeah, it's the face
you were making.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.249
No, no, we...

16:58.284 --> 17:00.117
(whispers): we need
a pregnancy test.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.152
For your daughter?

17:01.187 --> 17:04.221
What? No, stop
guessing things.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.723
Mm. All right, over there,

17:05.758 --> 17:08.559
next to the tissues
and champagne.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.061
We never know
which way it's gonna go.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.233
Did you do it yet?
What's happening?

17:16.268 --> 17:18.335
What's it say?

17:18.370 --> 17:20.404
ANDI: It doesn't say
anything yet. Stop asking me!

17:20.439 --> 17:22.773
Sorry! Sorry.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.842
Sorry.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.245
What's it say now?!

17:29.281 --> 17:30.681
One blue line.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.649
I'm not pregnant.

17:31.684 --> 17:32.616
We didn't do it!

17:32.651 --> 17:33.617
We got away with it!

17:33.652 --> 17:35.219
Oh, dodged a bullet.

17:35.254 --> 17:38.189
Yep. No more babies.
The store is closed.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.290
Yep, out of business.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.324
They are tearing down
the building

17:40.359 --> 17:41.459
and putting up a Walmart.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.227
(chuckles)
Whew.

17:43.262 --> 17:44.462
We are done.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.696
Done forever.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.132
Whew.
(sighs)

17:48.167 --> 17:50.201
Ooh.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.536
It feels weird to
say that out loud.

17:52.571 --> 17:56.140
Yeah. I mean, it seems
like just yesterday

17:56.175 --> 17:57.775
we found out
we were having Katie.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.276
Yeah.

17:59.311 --> 18:01.345
Yeah, I'll never
forget it.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.682
It all went by
so fast.

18:04.717 --> 18:08.219
Did it, really?

18:08.254 --> 18:09.286
(chuckles)

18:09.321 --> 18:11.622
No.
(chuckles)

18:11.657 --> 18:14.492
But I wouldn't
change any of it.

18:15.561 --> 18:17.595
Me, neither.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.264
You know,
in four years,

18:20.299 --> 18:22.233
Katie'll be
off to college.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.603
And then, in 12 years,
they'll all be gone.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.739
Well, maybe we can be
one of those couples

18:28.774 --> 18:30.307
that gets a little dog

18:30.342 --> 18:31.575
and pushes it around
in the stroller.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.310
(chuckles)

18:33.345 --> 18:36.547
Aw. You'd do that for me?

18:36.582 --> 18:38.883
I would.
Come here.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.118
Mwah.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.588
Hey, for the record,
I went three-for-four.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.824
Those are still
Hall of Fame numbers.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.328
You want to go
not make a baby?

18:51.363 --> 18:53.131
Yeah.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.666
Slow down!

18:55.701 --> 18:58.435
Ah...
Slow down. Slow.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.306
Save our energy
for the good part. That's right.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.242
(thunder claps)

19:05.278 --> 19:08.312
That possum's
never gonna get home.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.547
No, he might
find a new--

19:09.582 --> 19:12.483
Oh...
Oh...

19:12.518 --> 19:15.719
No, that snake
had other ideas.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.321
(thunder claps)
I'm scared.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.722
Can I sleep
with you guys?

19:18.757 --> 19:21.425
Yeah, honey, come here.
Yeah. Come on.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.494
Just a little thunderstorm.
Nothing to be scared of.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.196
Snuggle in.
Okay.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.730
What's that snake eating?

19:26.765 --> 19:29.900
Uh, candy.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.669
(thunder claps)

19:31.704 --> 19:33.504
Move over, Emme.
Okay. Come on.

19:33.539 --> 19:35.573
(strained):
Okay. All right.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.409
Okay.

19:38.444 --> 19:41.212
Okay, guys, it's
all gonna be fine.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.580
(thunder claps)

19:42.615 --> 19:44.481
Is there room
in there for me?

19:44.516 --> 19:45.750
Come on.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.720
(Adam sighs)

19:49.755 --> 19:52.790
I guess we still
have babies.
Yeah.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.960
One of 'em kicked me
right in the beans.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.563
It's okay. They're retired.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.241
Ooh. Thank you.
(chuckles)

20:10.276 --> 20:12.009
(grunts)

20:12.044 --> 20:15.346
Oh...
Who was I kidding?

20:15.381 --> 20:17.781
I couldn't have given this up
for nine months.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.517
(chuckles)
Yeah.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.454
It's better for all of us when
you can have a little wine.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.989
(door opens)

20:25.024 --> 20:26.257
Hey, guys.
Whew.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.891
Boy, is it a
beautiful day.

20:27.926 --> 20:30.494
Wow, Marcy,
you seem peppy.

20:30.529 --> 20:31.929
Well, Mikey picked up
the baby yesterday.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.665
So, we just slept
for a day and a half.
Oh...

20:34.700 --> 20:38.936
When I woke up, I peed
for 15 straight minutes.

20:38.971 --> 20:42.039
"World's Greatest Grandma"?

20:42.074 --> 20:45.276
Well, when I said good-bye
to Parker last night, I...

20:45.311 --> 20:48.879
I looked down at his fat
little cheeks and I thought,

20:48.914 --> 20:51.448
"I'm really gonna miss
this little guy."

20:51.483 --> 20:52.283
DON:
Mm-hmm.

20:52.318 --> 20:53.951
I'm a grandma.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.352
(chuckles)
So,

20:55.387 --> 20:56.553
he can call me...

20:56.588 --> 20:58.389
Marcy.
