00:07.310 --> 00:10.482
Cordi.

00:10.586 --> 00:13.241
<i>Cordi, wake up.</i>

00:17.448 --> 00:19.172
Hi.

00:19.275 --> 00:20.793
Were you gonna sleep all day

00:20.896 --> 00:23.310
or do you want to find
a way out of here?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.827
Honestly, uh...

00:28.931 --> 00:31.206
cuffed to an old sink
in the middle of nowhere

00:31.310 --> 00:34.379
is about how I'm feeling
right now, emotionally.

00:35.379 --> 00:37.034
Last night I learned that...

00:37.137 --> 00:39.206
Clay Cooper, uh...

00:39.310 --> 00:42.517
the guy I modeled
my whole life after,

00:42.620 --> 00:44.448
was a myth.

00:44.551 --> 00:47.655
The real Coop was
a deserter and a coward.

00:47.758 --> 00:49.896
- Cordi...
- If I'd known
what example I was following,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.724
maybe I'd have done things differently.

00:52.827 --> 00:54.793
Liam wouldn't have been tortured

00:54.896 --> 00:57.068
if I hadn't pushed so hard
on Grey Flag.

00:57.172 --> 00:59.172
Hoyt wouldn't...

00:59.275 --> 01:02.655
be gone if I didn't take
the Rodeo Kings case.

01:02.758 --> 01:06.275
Would I be a Ranger at all?
Where does that even leave me?

01:06.379 --> 01:09.103
Cuffed to an old sink
in the middle of nowhere.

01:10.517 --> 01:12.172
Look.

01:12.275 --> 01:14.482
Look, you are not

01:14.586 --> 01:17.206
a deserter.
You are not a coward.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.379
Yeah, well...

01:19.482 --> 01:21.379
maybe I'm not the man
you thought you knew.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.551
I don't know, maybe I never was.

01:23.655 --> 01:25.206
Well, you're gonna have
to get out of here

01:25.310 --> 01:27.344
if you want to find out.

01:36.482 --> 01:38.517
Mm.

01:41.862 --> 01:43.517
Do you remember
the time that Augie emptied

01:43.620 --> 01:45.379
his shot rings
out of his cap gun?

01:45.482 --> 01:47.275
Yeah.

01:47.379 --> 01:49.275
Tried to blow up
Stella's Barbie.

01:49.379 --> 01:51.689
How can I forget that?

02:30.068 --> 02:31.172
You wanted to see me?

02:31.275 --> 02:33.379
Trey!

02:33.482 --> 02:35.965
My guy, come on in, sit down.

02:36.068 --> 02:38.137
How are you? Good to see you.
Hey, are you thirsty?

02:38.241 --> 02:39.896
No, no, thank you.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.034
I'm good.

02:42.137 --> 02:44.758
What, you need to see me
drink from my glass first?

02:46.448 --> 02:49.000
Nah, I got to go work out.

02:49.103 --> 02:50.620
All right.

02:52.068 --> 02:53.275
First...

02:53.379 --> 02:55.482
let me just start by saying

02:55.586 --> 02:57.724
I'm stoked you're here.

02:57.827 --> 02:59.413
Bit of a rough start, I know,
but from what I hear,

02:59.517 --> 03:01.103
that was more
of a partner problem.

03:01.206 --> 03:02.517
Guys like you

03:02.620 --> 03:04.517
- show up when it counts.
- Yeah, well,

03:04.620 --> 03:07.379
I didn't expect to be here,
to say the least, but...

03:07.482 --> 03:09.827
here I am.

03:09.931 --> 03:12.896
Well, I'm sure you've got
a lot of questions, so...

03:13.000 --> 03:14.689
fire away.

03:16.310 --> 03:18.827
I don't even know
where to start, uh...

03:20.310 --> 03:22.827
At the fundraiser...

03:22.931 --> 03:25.379
did you poison yourself?

03:28.482 --> 03:31.620
In hindsight,
I wouldn't have used so much.

03:34.655 --> 03:36.655
No, the truth is...

03:36.758 --> 03:39.344
I'd been rising in the ranks
around here for some time.

03:39.448 --> 03:41.758
I mean, that chemist
that they found.

03:41.862 --> 03:43.172
But once he dropped

03:43.275 --> 03:44.931
the ball with that
whole Walker brothers thing,

03:45.034 --> 03:46.448
I started feeling like...

03:46.551 --> 03:48.517
somebody had to right
the ship around here.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.551
So, you know, here I am.

03:50.655 --> 03:52.000
Got to be willing to make
the big sacrifices

03:52.103 --> 03:53.241
from time to time.

03:53.344 --> 03:55.103
- Right?
- Right, yeah.

03:55.206 --> 03:57.551
Yeah, hey, listen,
it's no judgment over here.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.551
I mean, I'm just glad they found
people who want to...

04:00.655 --> 04:02.827
tear the system down
to the studs.

04:02.931 --> 04:05.551
I mean, no offense,
but in my experience,

04:05.655 --> 04:07.896
bureaucracy doesn't do jack.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.827
No offense taken.

04:09.931 --> 04:11.655
I agree.

04:11.758 --> 04:14.068
Listen, I believed
in bureaucracy at one point.

04:14.172 --> 04:16.620
The whole "hands across America,

04:16.724 --> 04:18.758
vote for a brighter
future" party line.

04:18.862 --> 04:20.793
But then I realized something.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.965
The whole system was flawed.

04:24.068 --> 04:25.896
It's designed by...

04:26.000 --> 04:29.862
people who are plagued by the
one thing that corrupts us all.

04:31.310 --> 04:33.827
Self-preservation.

04:33.931 --> 04:35.862
I mean, take Lana.

04:35.965 --> 04:37.896
She runs. Why?

04:39.034 --> 04:41.275
Deserters!

04:44.413 --> 04:46.379
Because she's afraid of us.

04:50.413 --> 04:52.655
Afraid of what guys
like you and me are

04:52.758 --> 04:54.620
willing to do
for the greater good.

04:54.724 --> 04:58.344
Now that's a whole mess
I got to clean up.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.758
That's for a different day.

05:00.862 --> 05:02.586
Yeah, yeah.

05:02.689 --> 05:04.724
Well, uh, I'm not scared.

05:04.827 --> 05:07.344
I see now that it might
cost a few lives

05:07.448 --> 05:09.689
to start a real revolution.

05:10.931 --> 05:13.310
Now that's
what I'm talking about.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.793
Yes. You get it.

05:15.896 --> 05:17.655
Trey Barnett.

05:17.758 --> 05:20.620
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you what.

05:20.724 --> 05:22.620
Why don't you go
do your workout and rest up

05:22.724 --> 05:24.724
- and be ready
for the mission, okay?
- Yes, sir.

05:24.827 --> 05:26.275
All right.

05:26.379 --> 05:27.827
Hey, uh,

05:27.931 --> 05:30.034
what is the mission, exactly?

05:30.137 --> 05:32.655
Trust me.

05:32.758 --> 05:34.379
You'll hear soon enough.

05:34.482 --> 05:36.448
But when you do...

05:41.862 --> 05:44.586
Now as far as the compound
itself, they were fully stocked.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.965
Uh, barracks, vehicles,
weapons-- you name it.

05:47.068 --> 05:49.206
We always knew they were
regrouping in the shadows

05:49.310 --> 05:50.862
but this strong and this fast?

05:50.965 --> 05:53.172
Kevin must have set them up
with some serious bankroll.

05:53.275 --> 05:54.758
I will...

05:54.862 --> 05:58.068
alert Tessa Graves.
Any word from Ranger Walker?

05:58.172 --> 05:59.517
Uh, not yet, sir.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.862
We're syncing up
with him after this.

06:01.965 --> 06:04.551
At any rate,
thank you for your hard work.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.103
Between you two and, uh,

06:06.206 --> 06:08.344
the work that Lana Jones did
providing intel,

06:08.448 --> 06:11.379
we've made serious strides
in the investigation.

06:11.482 --> 06:13.275
Well, the praise is appreciated,

06:13.379 --> 06:14.689
but unnecessary.

06:14.793 --> 06:16.724
Now as far
as infiltration points, I think

06:16.827 --> 06:18.137
our best option is
to come in from the south.

06:18.241 --> 06:20.448
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's pump the brakes on that.

06:20.551 --> 06:22.620
- We're not ready--
thank you very much.
- Here you go, sir.

06:22.724 --> 06:24.310
We're not ready to make
a move like that yet.

06:24.413 --> 06:26.482
I am sending in

06:26.586 --> 06:28.310
a team
with a surveillance package

06:28.413 --> 06:30.689
this afternoon. We will continue

06:30.793 --> 06:32.275
to monitor the situation.

06:32.379 --> 06:33.793
"Monitor the situation"?

06:33.896 --> 06:36.482
Sir, I understood

06:36.586 --> 06:38.896
pausing to regroup when

06:39.000 --> 06:40.862
we learned
that the leader of Grey Flag

06:40.965 --> 06:43.689
was a government official,
but we've done that,

06:43.793 --> 06:46.965
and now it's time to bust
in there and crack some skulls.

06:48.482 --> 06:49.931
No thank you.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.793
A raid on the compound
at this point would be...

06:52.896 --> 06:54.689
a bloodbath.
Can I have some sugar, please?

06:54.793 --> 06:56.758
Now I'm not willing to risk

06:56.862 --> 06:58.724
another Waco scenario.

06:58.827 --> 07:00.344
I'm sure as hell not gonna--
thank you very much.

07:00.448 --> 07:03.655
I'm not gonna provide them
with a damn recruitment video.

07:03.758 --> 07:05.862
These guys are killers.

07:05.965 --> 07:08.448
We've seen what they've done and
we know what they're gonna do.

07:08.551 --> 07:10.034
We can't just be
reactionary anymore.

07:10.137 --> 07:12.068
Let's play some offense
for God sakes!

07:12.172 --> 07:13.724
Perez!

07:13.827 --> 07:16.862
A word right now, please.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.689
Look, I get it, okay, trust me.

07:22.793 --> 07:24.724
This isn't just another case
for me, Cap.

07:24.827 --> 07:26.827
This is my entire career
as a Ranger.

07:26.931 --> 07:28.896
Okay, this all started
with Miles

07:29.000 --> 07:30.482
and I'll be damned
if I don't finish it.

07:30.586 --> 07:31.931
We know where they sleep

07:32.034 --> 07:32.965
and we're just supposed
to sit on our asses?

07:33.068 --> 07:34.448
It's chain of command, Cassie.

07:34.551 --> 07:35.931
We're not calling the shots, okay?

07:36.034 --> 07:37.655
And, yes, you were right
about being reactionary.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.655
Oh, I'm so sick
of being right, Cap.

07:39.758 --> 07:41.862
I was right
about Miles being alive.

07:41.965 --> 07:43.413
I was right
that Kevin was full of it.

07:43.517 --> 07:46.448
And now I'm right that the FBI
is making a bad decision.

07:46.551 --> 07:49.137
Okay, listen to me, just 'cause
our hands are tied doesn't mean

07:49.241 --> 07:51.000
we can't make moves, okay,
so first things first,

07:51.103 --> 07:53.103
I want you to--
Where are you going?

07:53.206 --> 07:55.689
You were gonna tell me
to go find Walker, hmm?

07:56.413 --> 07:58.517
Right again.

08:26.241 --> 08:28.413
Try not to blow your hand off
like Augie almost did.

08:28.517 --> 08:31.448
Yeah, if I ever tell him this
story, I'll probably leave

08:31.551 --> 08:33.103
this part out of it.

08:35.206 --> 08:36.586
Better hurry.

08:36.689 --> 08:38.172
Here goes nothing.

08:58.827 --> 09:01.206
Cassie. Hey, hey, hey!

09:01.310 --> 09:03.551
- Nice to see you, too.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:03.655 --> 09:04.965
How'd you find me?

09:05.068 --> 09:06.413
Um, I tracked
the last ping of your cell

09:06.517 --> 09:08.931
to a cell tower nearby,
I searched the area.

09:09.034 --> 09:11.448
Had a feeling
about this creepy cabin.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.965
- Yeah.
- Please tell me

09:13.068 --> 09:14.655
you didn't read from a book
bound in human flesh

09:14.758 --> 09:16.275
and inked in blood.

09:16.379 --> 09:19.379
Is-is that a <i>Hawk's Shadow</i>
reference or something?

09:19.482 --> 09:20.482
Yeah, of course.

09:20.586 --> 09:22.689
What the hell happened to you?

09:22.793 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, okay. I have a lot
to fill you in on.

09:25.103 --> 09:28.517
Yeah, that makes
two of us, partner.

09:28.620 --> 09:29.931
Come on. Let's go.

09:45.241 --> 09:47.724
So, yesterday, when you told me
to meet you at HQ,

09:47.827 --> 09:50.965
you actually went after Coop.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.965
Yeah, yeah, uh, Cass,

09:53.068 --> 09:55.206
I didn't mean to give you
the slip, honestly.

09:55.310 --> 09:56.551
I-I just figured I...

09:56.655 --> 09:57.896
I found him. Uh...

09:58.000 --> 10:01.137
I found Coop,
and things got testy, um,

10:01.241 --> 10:04.655
but he had half a dozen chances
to kill me, and he didn't.

10:04.758 --> 10:06.103
Coop's not the leader
of Grey Flag,

10:06.206 --> 10:08.034
but whoever is,
Coop's after him.

10:08.137 --> 10:09.724
Yeah, well, about that,
last night,

10:09.827 --> 10:12.344
Trey got a message out saying
that the leader of Grey Flag

10:12.448 --> 10:13.413
was making an appearance,

10:13.517 --> 10:15.724
so James and I scoped it out.

10:15.827 --> 10:18.379
And... You ready for this?

10:18.482 --> 10:19.724
Yeah.

10:19.827 --> 10:23.620
The leader of Grey Flag...

10:23.724 --> 10:25.620
is Kevin.

10:25.724 --> 10:28.310
Like, Kevin Golden, Kevin?
Your Kevin?

10:28.413 --> 10:32.034
Okay, well, let's not
call him "my Kevin."

10:33.172 --> 10:35.000
We only met Kevin
a few months ago.

10:35.103 --> 10:37.172
Coop said
he was-was back

10:37.275 --> 10:40.586
for the leader of Grey Flag,
so does Coop know Kevin?

10:40.689 --> 10:41.689
Why would Kevin

10:41.793 --> 10:44.241
kill off the members of my unit?

10:44.344 --> 10:46.379
And if he wants to kill me,
wh-what's he waiting for?

10:46.482 --> 10:49.517
Walker, that is a solid list of
questions I have no answers for.

10:49.620 --> 10:50.896
So, I was thinking maybe

10:51.000 --> 10:52.689
Julia can use
her government connections

10:52.793 --> 10:54.379
to help us put
the pieces together.

10:54.482 --> 10:57.482
I-I haven't been able to connect
with her for the last few days.

10:57.586 --> 10:59.137
Well, that's a bummer
'cause the FBI

10:59.241 --> 11:01.413
sure as hell seems to be
taking their time.

11:01.517 --> 11:04.758
They know where the super-secret
Grey Flag compound is,

11:04.862 --> 11:06.275
and they still won't move in.

11:08.413 --> 11:09.586
You know, well,
may-maybe they're right

11:09.689 --> 11:10.551
to hold off, you know.

11:10.655 --> 11:11.931
Or maybe-maybe

11:12.034 --> 11:13.689
they're wrong.
You know, maybe-maybe--

11:13.793 --> 11:15.241
How can you ever know, really,

11:15.344 --> 11:17.103
what's right or wrong
in a situation that's...

11:17.206 --> 11:18.827
Walker, I know you've had
a crazy night,

11:18.931 --> 11:20.827
but this is really not the time
to get all existential crisis-y.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.448
Okay? We need your head
in the game

11:22.551 --> 11:24.034
for the medal ceremony tonight.

11:24.137 --> 11:27.172
The medal ceremony.
Well, uh, um...

11:27.275 --> 11:29.586
Completely forgot
about the medal ceremony.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.344
Kevin will definitely be there,

11:31.448 --> 11:33.344
and he cannot know we're onto
him or they might sus out Trey.

11:33.448 --> 11:36.241
- Got to act totally normal.
- Yeah.

11:36.344 --> 11:37.551
Absolutely. Um...

11:37.655 --> 11:40.379
First things first, Cass,

11:40.482 --> 11:43.172
I think I just need
to see my kids.

11:44.896 --> 11:47.034
Yeah, we can make that happen.

11:47.137 --> 11:48.758
Okay.

12:07.172 --> 12:09.172
Listen to me, listen to me.

12:09.275 --> 12:10.620
Hey, take my notes
and tell them...

12:10.724 --> 12:13.103
Uh...

12:21.137 --> 12:22.551
Barnett.

12:22.655 --> 12:24.310
What're you doing?

12:24.413 --> 12:25.724
Uh...

12:25.827 --> 12:27.241
Just got word.
We're shipping out in an hour.

12:28.275 --> 12:29.551
Come on.

12:29.655 --> 12:31.793
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right. Let's get it.

12:31.896 --> 12:33.896
Yeah.

12:36.275 --> 12:38.000
All right. Hey, can you
get the plates

12:38.103 --> 12:39.275
- and get the napkins, too.
- Okay, I got the plates.

12:39.379 --> 12:40.724
I'm doing stuff,
I'm doing stuff.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.206
Hello.

12:42.310 --> 12:43.551
Hey, you're home.

12:43.655 --> 12:44.620
Hey, Dad.

12:44.724 --> 12:46.689
Hey. Hey, y'all.

12:46.793 --> 12:48.586
Cordi.
Hi.

12:48.689 --> 12:49.862
Where've you been?

12:49.965 --> 12:51.862
It's a long story,
uh, for later.

12:51.965 --> 12:54.172
Maybe never. I'm good, I'm good.

12:54.275 --> 12:56.793
Hey, team. I, uh,
I'm gonna go update James.

12:56.896 --> 12:58.862
Yeah, great.

13:00.275 --> 13:01.137
Wow.

13:01.241 --> 13:03.034
Oh, yeah, uh, Mom and Dad

13:03.137 --> 13:06.000
invited over some people
for a little ceremony post-game.

13:06.103 --> 13:08.172
Yeah, they're picking up
a few pounds of brisket

13:08.275 --> 13:09.862
and some hot links from Abuela.

13:09.965 --> 13:12.172
Nice, nice. Uh...

13:12.275 --> 13:15.241
What is this? A new logo?

13:15.344 --> 13:18.103
Oh, yeah, Stella came up
with the new design.

13:18.206 --> 13:20.103
Yeah, and somehow
Liam convinced Gramps.

13:20.206 --> 13:21.724
Yeah, we're doing a lot
with that rescue.

13:21.827 --> 13:23.206
You should see the new stables.

13:23.310 --> 13:26.206
Stella's really
come into her own.

13:26.310 --> 13:27.655
Uh, that's-that's great,

13:27.758 --> 13:29.103
that's great, Stella Blue.

13:29.206 --> 13:30.620
Uh, she's not the only one.

13:30.724 --> 13:32.206
Tell him, Augie.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.551
Yeah, I've been, uh,
I've been asked to give a speech

13:34.655 --> 13:35.827
for you at the medal ceremony.

13:35.931 --> 13:37.827
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:39.034 --> 13:42.034
Wow, uh, that's...
quite the honor.

13:42.137 --> 13:44.965
Uh, mayor asked you himself?

13:45.068 --> 13:47.413
Actually, I did.

13:49.068 --> 13:52.344
I wanted to do something a
little special for our big hero.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.413
You surprised?

14:02.758 --> 14:04.620
Hey, can I fix you
something, Cordell?

14:04.724 --> 14:06.551
No. No, thank you.
Uh, I'm-I'm good.

14:06.655 --> 14:08.379
Kevin's been helping out
a ton recently.

14:08.482 --> 14:10.172
He got us some amazing donors
for the rescue,

14:10.275 --> 14:12.724
he got our Side Step
liquor license back,

14:12.827 --> 14:14.000
he even did some heavy lifting

14:14.103 --> 14:15.827
with the, uh,
stable's construction.

14:15.931 --> 14:17.241
Ah, no, I don't think

14:17.344 --> 14:18.896
I can take credit
for that last one.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.413
Hammered more fingers
than nails.

14:22.103 --> 14:23.586
Uh, the only thing
he's not helping me with

14:23.689 --> 14:25.137
is write this speech,
which is literally your job.

14:25.241 --> 14:27.931
Uh, it's not literally
my job, Augie,

14:28.034 --> 14:29.551
and, besides, I told you,
it'll mean

14:29.655 --> 14:31.896
a heck of a lot more
if it comes from the heart.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.448
- Okay.
- Ain't that right, Cordell?

14:34.551 --> 14:36.413
Yeah, yeah, sure.

14:40.172 --> 14:41.965
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:42.068 --> 14:43.344
You okay?

14:44.724 --> 14:46.413
Bit of a rough night?

14:46.517 --> 14:48.965
Oh, uh... no.

14:49.068 --> 14:51.241
Work... stuff.

14:51.344 --> 14:52.965
Okay, so I got James
up to speed.

14:53.068 --> 14:56.172
- He thinks our next
move should be to...
- Cass. Cass.

14:58.206 --> 14:59.689
Oh, I see wh...

14:59.793 --> 15:01.275
No, look, it's not...

15:01.379 --> 15:03.965
Cass and I talked.
We're good. We're good, right?

15:04.068 --> 15:06.896
Yeah. [laughs] Yeah.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.172
Yeah, we are...

15:08.275 --> 15:11.206
No. No weirdness here,

15:11.310 --> 15:13.172
despite the tone of my voice
right now.

15:13.275 --> 15:15.551
Hey, uh, Dad, look,
I know this is, like,

15:15.655 --> 15:18.620
your celebration or whatever,
but, respectfully,

15:18.724 --> 15:21.034
can you leave?
I got to finish this speech,

15:21.137 --> 15:23.172
and it's got to be
a surprise, you know?

15:24.344 --> 15:26.172
Y-Yeah, sure. Course, bud.

15:26.275 --> 15:27.517
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.551
Yeah.

15:29.655 --> 15:32.827
Kev, hey, y-you mind
heading outside with me?

15:32.931 --> 15:35.241
Uh, so we can talk
over the schedule for today?

15:35.344 --> 15:36.620
- Absolutely.
- Great.

15:36.724 --> 15:38.965
- Let me just grab my jacket.
- Of course.

15:49.586 --> 15:52.310
- Coming through.
- So, is that the, uh...

15:52.413 --> 15:55.103
30 pounds of plastic fantastic.

15:55.206 --> 15:58.310
C-4's usually stable,

15:58.413 --> 16:01.793
but I took the liberty of mixing
ours with a chemical cocktail,

16:01.896 --> 16:02.965
give it a bit more kick.

16:03.068 --> 16:05.137
Same stuff you trained on,

16:05.241 --> 16:06.896
now with a bad attitude.

16:08.241 --> 16:11.275
Gentlemen, it's go time.

16:11.379 --> 16:14.586
Our target,
the mayor's medal ceremony.

16:14.689 --> 16:18.206
Set explosive charges in the
northeast elevator and get out.

16:19.793 --> 16:22.344
Our boss will be on the ground
to take care of the rest.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.103
Barnett and Snyder are on point,

16:25.206 --> 16:27.103
Daley's backup,

16:27.206 --> 16:28.275
and I'm driving.

16:28.379 --> 16:29.931
If anyone wants out,

16:30.034 --> 16:33.206
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

16:36.586 --> 16:39.206
Oh. Ah.
I should get my hip holster.

16:39.310 --> 16:40.379
All right.
Make it quick, Barnett.

16:40.482 --> 16:42.172
We're waiting on you.

16:45.827 --> 16:48.413
So, then we'll have Augie
come up and give his speech.

16:48.517 --> 16:50.827
The mayor will pin medals
on everyone, except you,

16:50.931 --> 16:53.206
because we're gonna have Augie
walk over and--

16:53.310 --> 16:55.517
spoiler alert--
pin a medal on his old man.

16:55.620 --> 16:58.034
They'll cry, they'll clap, then
it's off to a quick photo op,

16:58.137 --> 17:00.655
and that's about it.

17:00.758 --> 17:04.068
Great. Yeah, that-that all,
that all sounds great.

17:04.172 --> 17:05.862
Are you sure you're okay?

17:05.965 --> 17:07.655
Yeah.

17:07.758 --> 17:10.620
Okay, honestly, I-I just,

17:10.724 --> 17:13.000
I never liked making a fuss
over the work.

17:13.103 --> 17:14.896
You know,
most-most Rangers don't.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.655
It's not what we're in it for.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.793
You know,
back in my Marine days,

17:20.896 --> 17:24.655
I was awarded a Silver Star,
my whole unit was. Um...

17:24.758 --> 17:28.241
Our sergeant, a great man
named Clay Cooper,

17:28.344 --> 17:31.068
he was killed
during the mission.

17:31.172 --> 17:33.586
Yet, we all stood up there

17:33.689 --> 17:35.206
and let them shower us
with praise.

17:35.310 --> 17:37.103
You know, it just never
sat right with me.

17:37.206 --> 17:38.793
Didn't feel like I deserved it.

17:38.896 --> 17:40.206
Yeah.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.827
Well, I'll tell you one thing,

17:42.931 --> 17:45.724
you certainly deserve
this one.

17:45.827 --> 17:47.413
I mean, what you guys
went through at the hands

17:47.517 --> 17:49.896
of those guys is terrible,
really terrible.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.448
But the that you guys came
together and took them down,

17:52.551 --> 17:54.206
tell you what, the world
would be a lot better place

17:54.310 --> 17:56.896
if more people were willing
to make the sacrifices required

17:57.000 --> 17:58.137
like you.

17:58.241 --> 18:01.551
Just a shame Julia refused hers.

18:02.655 --> 18:04.172
She did?

18:04.275 --> 18:06.551
Yeah, she called me yesterday,
said she couldn't make it.

18:06.655 --> 18:08.344
Have you not heard from her?

18:08.448 --> 18:11.965
Uh... well, not-not recently.

18:12.068 --> 18:13.827
- Uh...
- You know, Cordell,

18:13.931 --> 18:16.068
you've got a beautiful home
and a wonderful family.

18:16.172 --> 18:19.551
A lot to be envious of.

18:21.068 --> 18:24.896
I can't wait to see Augie
on that stage giving his speech.

19:03.827 --> 19:05.517
Okay, fine, I'll check.

19:09.275 --> 19:10.724
I think you're hearing things.

19:10.827 --> 19:12.689
Nobody's here.

19:58.103 --> 19:59.655
Cass?

20:03.034 --> 20:04.724
Hey, you okay? What'd he say?

20:04.827 --> 20:07.448
Yeah.

20:07.551 --> 20:10.344
We know that Grey Flag is
gearing up for an attack, right?

20:10.448 --> 20:12.551
What better place than an event

20:12.655 --> 20:16.000
full of law enforcement,
Rangers, politicians?

20:16.103 --> 20:17.413
No, no, wait, you-you think

20:17.517 --> 20:19.137
that they're gonna hit
the medal ceremony?

20:19.241 --> 20:21.310
That's fast.

20:21.413 --> 20:22.758
The whole damn thing was
Kevin's idea.

20:22.862 --> 20:24.137
He could have been
working on this for weeks.

20:24.241 --> 20:26.379
And-and he didn't come right out

20:26.482 --> 20:29.689
and say it, but I-I think
he just threatened Augie.

20:31.068 --> 20:34.413
Okay, I'm gonna go to the safe
house and download the FBI.

20:34.517 --> 20:36.862
Go get dressed,
I'll meet you at the ceremony.

20:36.965 --> 20:39.551
I'll keep you in the loop,
and you do the same.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.413
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:42.482 --> 20:44.000
Is something wrong?

20:46.344 --> 20:48.827
Hey, uh...

20:49.586 --> 20:51.896
Yeah, yes, yes.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Um, there's,
there's something going on,

20:55.103 --> 20:56.758
but I can't talk about it

20:56.862 --> 20:58.517
right now. I-I just need

20:58.620 --> 21:01.413
your help,
okay, no questions asked.

21:01.517 --> 21:04.137
- Of course.
- Good.

21:04.241 --> 21:06.241
I need you to get Mama and Daddy

21:06.344 --> 21:08.413
back here as soon as possible,

21:08.517 --> 21:11.586
and under no circumstances

21:11.689 --> 21:15.241
is anybody to try and attend
the medal ceremony today.

21:15.344 --> 21:17.103
You understand?

21:17.206 --> 21:18.551
Wait, so I-I...

21:18.655 --> 21:21.172
I don't get
to deliver my speech?

21:21.275 --> 21:23.724
Augie...

21:25.137 --> 21:27.689
Buddy, hey.

21:27.793 --> 21:30.482
I would love to hear
your speech. How about this?

21:30.586 --> 21:31.793
How about this?
Maybe-maybe you

21:31.896 --> 21:33.241
read it to me when I get back, yeah?

21:33.344 --> 21:34.862
How's that sound?

21:34.965 --> 21:36.000
Yeah.

21:36.103 --> 21:37.448
- Sound good?
- Mm-hmm.

21:37.551 --> 21:39.793
- Okay.
- Yeah.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.862
Good.

21:45.379 --> 21:47.068
One more thing.

21:47.172 --> 21:48.586
My phone got smashed.

21:48.689 --> 21:50.034
I need to borrow yours.

21:50.137 --> 21:51.793
Yeah. Sure.

22:13.310 --> 22:15.241
You okay?

22:15.344 --> 22:16.724
Do I look okay?

22:18.379 --> 22:20.344
Sorry, I just feel like

22:20.448 --> 22:23.482
I feel like I've been doing
really well, you know, like...

22:23.586 --> 22:25.793
better than I was
at Thanksgiving.

22:25.896 --> 22:28.206
And Dad's just been so busy
he hasn't been able to see it.

22:28.310 --> 22:31.000
And that speech was, like,
my one chance to, like...

22:31.103 --> 22:32.586
to prove that I'm, like...

22:32.689 --> 22:34.931
not a jerk, I guess.

22:35.793 --> 22:38.068
Well, you left your speech
on the printer.

22:40.172 --> 22:41.758
Um...

22:41.862 --> 22:43.379
You read that?
Uh, there was, like,

22:43.482 --> 22:45.344
some spellchecks that I had
to, like, figure out and...

22:45.448 --> 22:47.034
Augie, Augie, it was beautiful.

22:47.137 --> 22:50.000
The parts about Mom and Dad's
service...

22:50.103 --> 22:52.551
setting you straight.

22:53.448 --> 22:55.172
You liked it?

22:55.275 --> 22:56.689
It was perfect.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.137
Hey.

22:58.241 --> 23:00.344
I'm proud of you, Toad.

23:00.448 --> 23:02.034
Thanks, Stell.

23:05.103 --> 23:06.655
You're welcome.

23:07.689 --> 23:09.965
I mean, you really
could have mentioned

23:10.068 --> 23:12.000
your kickass older sister
who whipped you into shape,

23:12.103 --> 23:14.551
but don't worry, there's still
time to do another pass at it.

23:14.655 --> 23:17.137
- Gee, I didn't realize that
you were getting the medal, too.
- Hey!

23:17.241 --> 23:19.551
Respect your elders.

23:19.655 --> 23:21.482
All right, listen up.

23:21.586 --> 23:24.034
Eyes front now.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.448
Captain James

23:26.551 --> 23:29.275
received a text message
with the words "medal ceremony"

23:29.379 --> 23:32.724
and the last four digits of
Ranger Barnett's badge number.

23:32.827 --> 23:34.482
Grey Flag is targeting

23:34.586 --> 23:36.137
the mayor's medal ceremony
this afternoon.

23:36.241 --> 23:39.034
Now we do not have a lot of time
to mount a counteroffensive,

23:39.137 --> 23:41.413
so I need all of you
on your A-games.

23:41.517 --> 23:43.586
Now according to...

23:43.689 --> 23:45.000
the intel provided by Lana,

23:45.103 --> 23:48.034
the attack involves
placing charges

23:48.137 --> 23:49.206
inside the elevators.

23:49.310 --> 23:51.482
<i>Extra officers will be stationed</i>

23:51.586 --> 23:52.862
<i>at every elevator door.</i>

23:52.965 --> 23:54.482
<i>On top of metal detectors,</i>

23:54.586 --> 23:56.379
<i>FBI plainclothes officers</i>

23:56.482 --> 23:59.000
<i>will keep an eye out
for anyone suspicious.</i>

23:59.103 --> 24:01.206
<i>And I will</i>

24:01.310 --> 24:04.068
<i>personally intercept Mayor
Newburg en route to the ceremony</i>

24:04.172 --> 24:07.655
<i>and redirect him back here
to the safe house.</i>

24:10.344 --> 24:12.275
Mr. Mayor, we're having a bit

24:12.379 --> 24:14.172
of a security situation, we
need to redirect this vehicle.

24:14.275 --> 24:16.551
Officer, if you could turn
around and follow us, please?

24:16.655 --> 24:18.586
Follow him.

24:18.689 --> 24:22.689
<i>Once we have secured
Trey and his compatriots,</i>

24:22.793 --> 24:25.931
we will initiate
a raid on the compound.

24:26.034 --> 24:29.586
I know this isn't everyone's
favorite plan of attack.

24:29.689 --> 24:32.896
But I have full confidence
in this team.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.206
In every single one of you.

24:36.310 --> 24:38.620
Let's go get the bastards.

24:48.758 --> 24:50.379
Julia, hey.

24:50.482 --> 24:51.965
<i>Hey, Cordell.</i>

24:52.068 --> 24:54.344
You got my text.

24:54.448 --> 24:56.172
I had to borrow Liam's phone.

24:56.275 --> 24:58.068
Mine got smashed last night.

24:58.172 --> 25:00.206
Hey, I've been trying
to reach you--

25:00.310 --> 25:02.103
<i>I need to talk to you in person.</i>

25:02.206 --> 25:04.034
<i>Can we meet?</i>

25:04.137 --> 25:07.344
Well, right now, uh, I'm heading
to the medal ceremony.

25:07.448 --> 25:08.931
<i>It's about Grey Flag.</i>

25:09.034 --> 25:11.551
Okay, uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

25:13.586 --> 25:15.034
I'll send you an address.

25:15.137 --> 25:16.758
<i>Will there be people around?</i>

25:16.862 --> 25:20.000
Yeah, FBI. Why?

25:20.103 --> 25:22.206
<i>I'm going to tell my editor
I'm meeting with you.</i>

25:22.310 --> 25:24.724
<i>Okay, tell your editor,
but, please, Julia,</i>

25:24.827 --> 25:26.344
do not give them the address.

25:26.448 --> 25:27.344
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

25:27.448 --> 25:28.827
Yeah, texting you now.

25:44.827 --> 25:47.172
All right, all clear so far.

25:47.275 --> 25:48.965
Stay frosty though.

25:49.068 --> 25:51.689
<i>- They could be anywhere.</i>
- Will do, Cap.

26:18.482 --> 26:19.896
Hey.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.758
Walker just texted.
He had to make a pit stop.

26:21.862 --> 26:23.344
Look, I got to be honest, Cap.

26:23.448 --> 26:25.482
I'm a little worried
about his headspace.

26:25.586 --> 26:27.000
I think the stuff last night

26:27.103 --> 26:28.551
with Coop really threw him
for a loop.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.482
And that is coming from
a woman who just found out

26:30.586 --> 26:32.655
she's been on dates with
multiple domestic terrorists.

26:32.758 --> 26:33.931
Speaking of which...

26:34.034 --> 26:36.344
Hey, team. Has the Walker
clan landed yet?

26:36.448 --> 26:37.758
Just got a text from Walker.

26:37.862 --> 26:39.034
Actually, they're, uh,
running a little behind.

26:39.137 --> 26:40.655
Oh, that's okay,
the mayor's late, too.

26:40.758 --> 26:42.379
I'll see if I can push it by,
like, ten or something.

26:42.482 --> 26:44.586
Can't start
without the guests of honor.

26:44.689 --> 26:46.068
- Am I right?
- Sure can't.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.344
- All right, see you in there.
- Sounds good.

26:50.034 --> 26:52.137
You think he's onto us?

26:52.241 --> 26:53.896
I don't know.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.724
But he doesn't seem worried.

26:59.206 --> 27:01.103
Hey.

27:01.206 --> 27:03.000
Said you needed to talk, uh...

27:03.103 --> 27:05.931
- you all right?
- I've been put on a story.

27:06.034 --> 27:09.344
I have to...
leave tonight for Europe.

27:10.827 --> 27:12.551
Oh, uh...

27:12.655 --> 27:14.586
congratulations.

27:14.689 --> 27:16.068
Listen, Cordell.

27:16.172 --> 27:18.034
We've built up some trust.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.655
Or at least I hope we have.

27:20.758 --> 27:22.344
Can you be honest with me?

27:22.448 --> 27:23.689
Of course.

27:23.793 --> 27:26.206
What is it?

27:26.310 --> 27:29.344
Are you working with Grey Flag?

27:30.344 --> 27:32.206
Is that a serious question?

27:32.310 --> 27:36.034
Julia, we've been working
together for weeks

27:36.137 --> 27:37.965
trying to take them down
and-and you think

27:38.068 --> 27:39.655
I might be a part of it?

27:39.758 --> 27:41.310
You're not saying no.

27:41.413 --> 27:43.172
I didn't think I had to.

27:44.206 --> 27:46.620
Julia, Grey Flag tortured me.

27:46.724 --> 27:48.379
They tortured my brother.

27:48.482 --> 27:49.931
Murdered my unit.

27:50.034 --> 27:52.862
Would I have brought you
to an FBI safe house

27:52.965 --> 27:54.344
if I was working for them?

27:54.448 --> 27:56.896
I don't know
what you'd be capable of.

28:11.103 --> 28:12.827
There's the maintenance
access door

28:12.931 --> 28:14.862
that leads
to the elevator shaft.

28:28.724 --> 28:30.172
All right.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.068
We'll be on walkie
if anything goes south.

28:32.172 --> 28:34.862
- You two ready?
- Hell yeah.

28:34.965 --> 28:36.620
You good, bro?

28:36.724 --> 28:38.000
Not getting cold feet?

28:38.103 --> 28:39.241
Of course I'm good, man.

28:39.344 --> 28:41.827
I got the bag, let's do this.

28:41.931 --> 28:43.068
Hold on, hold on,
wait, wait, wait.

28:45.586 --> 28:47.620
APD incoming.

28:50.172 --> 28:51.482
Why are you saying all of this?

28:51.586 --> 28:52.965
Help me understand.

28:53.068 --> 28:55.034
I have intel that suggests
that you were turned

28:55.137 --> 28:57.068
and have been working
with Grey Flag for months.

28:57.172 --> 28:59.034
Intel? Wh-What intel?

28:59.137 --> 29:02.068
You escaped from captivity
against all odds.

29:02.172 --> 29:04.931
You got to the Grey Flag chemist

29:05.034 --> 29:06.827
30 minutes
before law enforcement.

29:06.931 --> 29:08.482
Your unit was murdered.

29:08.586 --> 29:11.275
The last of which only happened
after I led you to him.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.931
Maybe you're not
a willing participant.

29:15.034 --> 29:17.758
Maybe they have something over
you. Show me where I'm wrong.

29:17.862 --> 29:20.344
Julia, that's not intel,
that's just circumstantial.

29:20.448 --> 29:23.034
How can I possibly defend the
way things actually happened?

29:23.137 --> 29:25.103
There's more.

29:26.758 --> 29:28.482
Go.

29:29.482 --> 29:31.000
Okay.

29:33.137 --> 29:34.827
I did some digging,

29:34.931 --> 29:36.620
and there were
multiple large donations

29:36.724 --> 29:39.068
from a shady military contractor
to an account

29:39.172 --> 29:41.068
connected to the charity
recently founded

29:41.172 --> 29:43.551
by your family, Walker Rescues.

29:45.793 --> 29:47.758
Come on.

29:47.862 --> 29:51.517
I'm gonna hazard a guess at,
at your, uh, credible source.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.862
Uh, Kevin Golden?

29:55.655 --> 29:58.379
I can't reveal
the identities of my sources.

29:58.482 --> 30:00.000
Okay, Julia, this is

30:00.103 --> 30:02.586
brand-new information
as of last night.

30:04.034 --> 30:07.034
The Rangers
and FBI have confirmed

30:07.137 --> 30:09.379
that Kevin is
the leader of Grey Flag.

30:09.482 --> 30:11.862
- What?
- He's been helping my family
with charity donations.

30:11.965 --> 30:13.172
Liam can confirm it.

30:13.275 --> 30:14.931
I guarantee you
he-he set up this...

30:15.034 --> 30:17.862
bogus paper trail
to try and frame me.

30:17.965 --> 30:20.344
I don't, I don't know, Cordell.

30:20.448 --> 30:22.931
You do know, Julia. You didn't
come here to accuse me.

30:23.034 --> 30:24.689
You came here
because some part of you

30:24.793 --> 30:26.896
knows that this isn't true.

30:27.965 --> 30:30.068
I'm telling the truth.
I always have.

30:30.172 --> 30:33.965
I thought Clay Cooper was
the leader of Grey Flag.

30:35.724 --> 30:36.931
Coop...

30:37.034 --> 30:38.965
was a misunderstanding.

30:39.068 --> 30:41.000
He told me himself.

30:41.103 --> 30:43.172
You found him?

30:43.275 --> 30:44.793
Yeah.

30:44.896 --> 30:46.724
I found him.

30:46.827 --> 30:49.103
But now, uh...

30:50.172 --> 30:52.310
...he's in the wind.

30:56.793 --> 30:58.896
Hi, guys. How are you?
Good to see you.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.586
Hey, hey, good to see you guys.

31:00.689 --> 31:02.034
- Hey.
- Welcome, welcome.

31:02.137 --> 31:03.758
- Glad you could make it.
- So good to see you.

31:10.482 --> 31:12.000
Looks like
they're heading this way.

31:12.103 --> 31:13.586
Better lock and load,
it could get messy.

31:13.689 --> 31:15.310
Whoa, whoa, hold on, man,
what are you thinking?

31:15.413 --> 31:16.931
You really want to get
into a firefight right now?

31:17.034 --> 31:18.413
We got a bag full of explosives

31:18.517 --> 31:20.413
right here that we haven't
even delivered yet.

31:20.517 --> 31:22.655
This mission will be over
before it even started.

31:22.758 --> 31:24.103
You have a better idea?

31:25.758 --> 31:27.379
Jones, get down.

31:27.482 --> 31:30.137
Where you going?! Trey!

31:32.724 --> 31:34.965
Who's there?

31:35.068 --> 31:37.689
Boys in blue!
I bet they got y'all

31:37.793 --> 31:39.965
working overtime, huh?

31:40.068 --> 31:42.758
Hey, uh, aren't you,
aren't you Trey Barnett?

31:42.862 --> 31:44.275
The one and only.

31:44.379 --> 31:45.724
Guys, it's all clear down here.

31:45.827 --> 31:48.000
I was just grabbing something
out of my van.

31:48.103 --> 31:50.000
I think we can head on back
upstairs, back to this party.

31:50.103 --> 31:52.103
Wait, hold on a second.

31:52.206 --> 31:54.379
Weren't you fired from
the Rangers a few weeks ago?

31:54.482 --> 31:56.137
I mean, I was...

31:56.241 --> 31:58.655
You're not really dressed
for a medal ceremony.

31:58.758 --> 32:01.689
I know, right?
I was invited last-minute.

32:02.827 --> 32:04.482
Me and three of my friends were.

32:04.586 --> 32:06.034
By Willy Lamb.

32:06.137 --> 32:08.241
You can radio up
to Captain Larry James

32:08.344 --> 32:10.724
and he'll confirm our invites.

32:20.965 --> 32:23.551
You think we get two medals
if we stop an attack?

32:25.068 --> 32:27.482
<i>OFFICER [over radio]:
Captain James?</i>

32:28.517 --> 32:29.310
Go for James.

32:29.413 --> 32:30.655
<i>I've got a Trey Barnett</i>

32:30.758 --> 32:32.068
down here in the garage.

32:32.172 --> 32:34.586
He says he was invited
by a Willy Lamb.

32:34.689 --> 32:36.310
Does that name
ring a bell to you?

32:36.413 --> 32:38.724
Willy Lamb's my old mentor,
passed away years ago.

32:38.827 --> 32:41.724
Trey's trying to warn us.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.758
Hold Barnett there.
We're coming to you.

32:43.862 --> 32:46.344
<i>Copy that.</i>

32:54.827 --> 32:56.758
Shouldn't be long now.

32:56.862 --> 32:58.551
Oh, okay.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.206
You guys got to get out of here

33:02.310 --> 33:03.862
- right now.
- He's got a gun!

33:03.965 --> 33:05.413
- Whoa, whoa!
- Get down on the ground!
- Get down, now!

33:05.517 --> 33:06.689
- Hands above your head!
- Listen to me!

33:06.793 --> 33:08.413
You need to listen to me now!
Hey!

33:08.517 --> 33:09.896
Grab my gun, but you got to go,
you understand me?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.620
You got to get out of here now,
listen to me!

33:15.931 --> 33:17.965
Barnett, move!

33:30.689 --> 33:32.344
<i>OFFICER [over radio]:
Shots fired!</i>

33:32.448 --> 33:34.620
<i>South garage. Officer down.</i>

33:34.724 --> 33:36.862
There's a shooter!

34:08.103 --> 34:09.724
Where's Jones?

34:09.827 --> 34:11.758
He split as soon as
the shooting started. Coward.

34:12.758 --> 34:14.068
Barnett!

34:14.172 --> 34:16.724
Put down your weapons!

34:21.413 --> 34:23.241
I got to get to him.

34:23.344 --> 34:25.344
- Give me suppressing fire.
- Yes, sir.

34:25.448 --> 34:27.862
- On that back wall
on three, okay?
- Yeah.

34:27.965 --> 34:30.275
One, two...

34:30.379 --> 34:32.965
three.

34:42.724 --> 34:45.137
- You good?
- No, I'm all out, Cap.

34:47.793 --> 34:48.965
That the Ranger captain?

34:49.068 --> 34:50.896
Boss is gonna love this.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.482
I got your back.

34:58.862 --> 35:01.620
Behind you!

35:04.034 --> 35:06.172
Cap, we're clear!

35:09.034 --> 35:11.379
Officer down, officer down!

35:11.482 --> 35:13.931
I need assistance. I need
an ambulance out here now.

35:14.034 --> 35:16.310
You have got to be kidding me!

35:16.413 --> 35:17.931
Texas Rangers.

35:18.034 --> 35:19.689
You're under arrest.

35:28.448 --> 35:30.482
I had the gun
pointed right at him.

35:30.586 --> 35:31.896
But something in me

35:32.000 --> 35:33.931
couldn't bring myself
to pull the trigger.

35:34.034 --> 35:36.724
Before Coop left, he told me

35:36.827 --> 35:38.931
that the entire reason
he came back

35:39.034 --> 35:41.310
was because
of the leader of Grey Flag.

35:41.413 --> 35:43.206
So there's some connection

35:43.310 --> 35:45.482
between Coop and Kevin.

35:45.586 --> 35:47.620
You know, but I just...

35:47.724 --> 35:49.862
haven't figured it out yet.

35:50.689 --> 35:53.793
What other lies
has he told me over the years?

35:55.379 --> 35:58.827
It never felt right,
what he told me about you.

36:03.517 --> 36:06.000
You said you were
leaving tonight?

36:07.862 --> 36:09.310
For how long?

36:10.241 --> 36:11.724
Editor said six months,

36:11.827 --> 36:13.689
maybe longer.

36:14.896 --> 36:16.586
Oh.

36:16.689 --> 36:19.448
Maybe we can see where we're at
when I get back?

36:19.551 --> 36:22.103
Ranger Walker?
- Yes?

36:22.206 --> 36:24.931
So sorry to interrupt,
but I thought you should know.

36:25.034 --> 36:26.965
They stopped the attack
at the ceremony.

36:27.068 --> 36:29.137
That's great, thank you.

36:29.241 --> 36:30.862
That's great news.

36:30.965 --> 36:32.965
That's great.

36:34.827 --> 36:37.172
We secured the elite squad, put
an APB out for Kevin's arrest.

36:37.275 --> 36:39.379
I've radioed my people
on the ground to move forward

36:39.482 --> 36:41.379
with the compound raid.

36:41.482 --> 36:43.310
Incredible work, Captain James.

36:43.413 --> 36:44.758
I can't take all the credit, sir.

36:44.862 --> 36:46.034
Ranger Perez
and Ranger Barnett were there

36:46.137 --> 36:47.448
every step of the way.

36:47.551 --> 36:49.206
Feels like I owe them two medals
at this point.

36:49.310 --> 36:51.310
All in a day's work, sir.

36:51.413 --> 36:53.448
Hey, guys, you need
to come look at this.

36:53.551 --> 36:55.310
All right, well,
we'll keep you updated.

36:55.413 --> 36:57.620
<i>All right, thank you.</i>

36:59.551 --> 37:02.241
That's the bag of explosives.

37:02.344 --> 37:04.517
It has bullet holes.

37:04.620 --> 37:07.068
Shouldn't that have blown
this whole place sky-high?

37:07.172 --> 37:09.000
Yeah.

37:10.655 --> 37:13.310
Hold on, Trey. We should wait
for the bomb squad. Wait.

37:20.068 --> 37:22.000
Oh, my God.

37:23.034 --> 37:24.379
I knew I was right.

37:24.482 --> 37:25.965
Kevin wasn't worried.

37:27.103 --> 37:29.896
So I guess this is, uh, goodbye.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.551
For now.

37:33.379 --> 37:34.758
For now.

37:36.103 --> 37:38.482
Actually...

37:38.586 --> 37:40.206
Julia...

37:41.655 --> 37:42.827
- Sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:42.931 --> 37:43.965
Uh, it's Cass.

37:44.068 --> 37:45.034
I-I probably should

37:45.137 --> 37:46.103
- answer it.
- Take it.

37:46.206 --> 37:47.379
Uh, don't-don't leave yet.

37:47.482 --> 37:48.517
Give me-- give me one minute.

37:48.620 --> 37:51.241
- Okay.
- Okay? Okay. Yeah.

37:51.344 --> 37:53.448
- Cass, hey, I heard about...
<i>- Walker.</i>

37:53.551 --> 37:54.896
<i>Walker, listen to me.</i>

37:55.000 --> 37:56.689
<i>The medal ceremony
was a distraction.</i>

37:56.793 --> 37:59.137
Kevin knows everything. He knows
that Trey was undercover.

37:59.241 --> 38:00.827
What? How?

38:00.931 --> 38:03.758
<i>I'll explain everything later.
But the C-4 isn't here.</i>

38:03.862 --> 38:05.965
<i>We're tracking Kevin's movements
from today.</i>

38:06.068 --> 38:08.000
<i>Nothing weird so far...</i>

38:08.103 --> 38:09.310
Oh, God. Julia!

38:09.413 --> 38:11.000
Get down!

38:34.068 --> 38:36.000
Walker.

38:36.931 --> 38:39.000
Walker!

38:40.517 --> 38:43.068
I think
they just hit the safe house.

38:50.379 --> 38:52.344
How'd it go?

38:52.448 --> 38:53.344
You were right.

38:53.448 --> 38:55.793
He never checked the bag.

38:56.620 --> 38:57.620
Good.

38:57.724 --> 38:59.448
Put in the call to APD.

39:10.310 --> 39:11.275
<i>Cordi.</i>

39:11.379 --> 39:12.793
<i>Wake up.</i>

39:21.551 --> 39:23.103
<i>Cordi.</i>

39:26.068 --> 39:27.413
<i>Cordi.</i>

39:27.517 --> 39:29.241
<i>Wake up.</i>

39:58.517 --> 40:00.137
Julia.
