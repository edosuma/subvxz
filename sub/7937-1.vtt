39:54.225 --> 39:55.647
That there were
two more like him?

39:58.062 --> 40:00.861
I guess so,
but they seemed smaller.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.026
Mmmmm.
You mean like children?

40:03.192 --> 40:05.820
Oh, no, no, no. These aren't children.
They're strong.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.534
Dwarfs?

40:07.697 --> 40:10.701
I don't know what they were.
I couldn't see them. I felt them.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.044
They're real, aren't they?

40:14.203 --> 40:15.295
- I mean, these...
- Mm-hmm.

40:15.455 --> 40:16.798
- Bites and bruises are real.
- Mm-hmm.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.299
- They're real.
- Yes, yes.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.460
The bites are real.
The bruises are real.

40:20.627 --> 40:23.301
All pain is real.
Your feelings? They're real.

40:24.797 --> 40:28.643
Oh, no, no. These are in places
I couldn't have bitten myself.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.224
Carla, I've seen
cases of hysteria

40:31.387 --> 40:33.060
that have raised welts,

40:33.222 --> 40:35.600
caused blindness,
loss of hearing.

40:38.603 --> 40:40.526
Well, haven't your tests
told you anything?

40:40.688 --> 40:42.656
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

40:42.815 --> 40:46.661
We know that there is nothing
wrong with you medically,

40:46.819 --> 40:48.913
physiologically, that is.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.291
And as far as we can tell,
your intellect

40:51.449 --> 40:53.497
seems to function as well,
if not better than normal.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.504
So that leaves only one area
for us to explore--

40:56.663 --> 40:58.711
early psychological
development,

40:58.873 --> 41:00.967
emotional development.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.547
What does that mean?

41:02.710 --> 41:04.963
Well, the general idea

41:05.129 --> 41:07.973
is that certain phases
of our life never really die.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.635
They continue to exist
within us, all of us.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.304
Now I'm talking
about you, me, everybody,

41:12.470 --> 41:14.939
and they affect us
the rest of our lives.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.941
For certain reasons,
they come back.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.443
By coming back--

41:18.601 --> 41:20.148
And sometimes they come back
with a vengeance--

41:20.311 --> 41:22.234
they can cause delusions,

41:22.397 --> 41:24.149
anxieties,

41:24.315 --> 41:26.443
hallucinations.

41:26.609 --> 41:27.952
So simple.

41:28.111 --> 41:31.786
Look, Carla,
what I'm going to do

41:31.948 --> 41:34.497
is I'm going to give you
some tranquilizers, okay?

41:34.659 --> 41:37.503
They won't knock you out,
but they will reduce your anxiety,

41:37.662 --> 41:39.335
which can be as bad
as the delusion itself.

and I want somebody to be
with you at all times, okay?

41:51.259 --> 41:53.637

that terrible things happened to me in
my youth might come back to haunt me.

Yeah, essentially.

Well, terrible things
did happen to me,

As a kid, I experienced
every cliché in the book.

45:50.790 --> 45:53.634
I was afraid of the dark.

45:53.793 --> 45:55.795
I was scared of my father.

45:55.962 --> 45:57.839
He was a minister,
if you can believe it.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.679
He actually spoke
with "thee" and "thou."

46:00.841 --> 46:02.889
I was six before I realized
not everyone talked that way.

46:03.052 --> 46:04.395
It was quite a shock.

46:04.553 --> 46:06.055
Why were you afraid of him?

46:07.556 --> 46:08.933
Because when he held me,

46:09.100 --> 46:10.977
it wasn't the way a father
should hold a daughter.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.111
How did he hold you?

46:13.271 --> 46:15.148

Did your mother know?

46:24.573 --> 46:27.042
I got as far as New York,
and that's where I met Mario.

46:27.201 --> 46:30.671
Billy's the spitting image of him.
It's very strange.

46:30.830 --> 46:33.379

Must have been quite handsome.

- Billy's a good-looking kid.
- He was.

46:38.087 --> 46:40.340
Can you tell me about him?

46:40.506 --> 46:42.975
I was 16.
That says an awful lot right there.

46:43.134 --> 46:45.182
I was--
I'd never met anyone like him.

46:45.344 --> 46:47.517

46:47.680 --> 46:50.274
What do you mean, "exciting"?
Exciting in bed?

46:50.433 --> 46:53.186
Yeah. He was exciting in bed.
He was exciting in many ways.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.025
But you did like
making love with him?

46:55.187 --> 46:56.404
Mm-hmm.

and then it turned bad.

Before I knew it,

47:04.363 --> 47:06.582
he started drinking,
taking pills.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.368
It was a mess.
Everything was a mess.

47:09.869 --> 47:12.668
What happened to him?

47:12.830 --> 47:15.083

on his motorcycle.

- I see. How old were you?
- 16.

47:20.463 --> 47:23.307

47:27.845 --> 47:29.518
How do you think I felt?

47:29.680 --> 47:31.603
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

47:31.766 --> 47:33.393
- He was my husband.
- Yeah, I know that,

47:33.559 --> 47:35.186

how you felt.

47:39.190 --> 47:40.817

47:54.413 --> 47:55.881

47:56.040 --> 47:58.213
He was older.
He knew a lot.

47:58.376 --> 48:01.630
He made me see
that life was good,

48:01.796 --> 48:05.016
that men and women loving
each other was good, healthy,

48:05.174 --> 48:08.018
having children
was good, simple.

48:08.177 --> 48:10.475

48:15.309 --> 48:17.311

Mom!

51:51.650 --> 51:53.652
(GIRLS CRYING)

51:56.155 --> 52:00.661
Well, Dr. Sneiderman explained
it was like a very powerful dream.

52:00.826 --> 52:02.794
Mrs. Moran...

52:05.497 --> 52:07.044
did you believe him?

52:08.626 --> 52:10.628
I tried to.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.546
But you...

52:12.713 --> 52:15.387
cannot. Hmm?

52:18.260 --> 52:20.604
Why?

52:20.763 --> 52:25.018
Because he hurt my son.
He broke his wrist.

52:25.184 --> 52:28.654
Because my children feel it.

52:28.812 --> 52:31.782
Because of the marks on my body.
They're in places I--

52:31.940 --> 52:34.568
I can't do it to myself.
Even in a dream.

52:34.735 --> 52:37.534
Why does he attack you, Carla,

52:37.696 --> 52:39.790
not anyone else?

52:41.283 --> 52:42.785
I don't know.

52:44.411 --> 52:46.038
I suppose he chose me.

52:46.205 --> 52:48.799
Chose you? Why?

52:52.169 --> 52:54.718
I suppose
he finds me attractive.

52:56.298 --> 52:59.723
Would it be a reflection
on you as a woman

52:59.885 --> 53:01.853
if he left you,

53:02.012 --> 53:04.014
or if you were cured?

53:05.974 --> 53:08.944
No. It would not be
a reflection on me.

53:09.103 --> 53:11.481
I hate this whole thing.
It's like a nightmare,

53:11.647 --> 53:13.866
I can't wake up.
I want to get rid of him.

53:14.024 --> 53:16.197
Of course you do, Carla.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.987
And we're trying to help you.

53:18.153 --> 53:21.032
Well, I'm not sure how much good
all this talking's doing.

53:21.198 --> 53:24.293
Well, it's our way
of trying to understand.

53:24.451 --> 53:27.250
Well, so far, it hasn't helped.
It hasn't with Dr. Sneiderman.

53:35.796 --> 53:38.424
Look, you'll have to excuse me.
I have an appointment.

53:38.590 --> 53:40.092
I have to meet someone at
the airport. Is that all right?

53:40.259 --> 53:44.639
Certainly, and thank you very much,
Carla, for letting us talk to you.

53:44.805 --> 53:46.728
- Sure.
- All right.

53:51.437 --> 53:53.280
Quite a young lady.

53:53.439 --> 53:56.113
- Yep.
- How did you meet her?

53:56.275 --> 53:58.277
I was on call one night at
the clinic, she walked in.

53:58.444 --> 54:00.037
Just came in out of the blue?

54:00.195 --> 54:01.538
- Please.
- There you go.

54:01.697 --> 54:03.665
- Thank you.
- A walk-in.

54:03.824 --> 54:06.418
That's how it happens.

54:06.577 --> 54:09.421
- Yeah.
- She's masturbating.

54:09.580 --> 54:11.207
This entire circus,
she has invented it

54:11.373 --> 54:13.046
to cover up what
every little girl does.

54:13.208 --> 54:15.586
Well, with all due respect, sir,

54:15.753 --> 54:17.721
that was my initial diagnosis,

54:17.880 --> 54:19.382
but I think we can all agree

54:19.548 --> 54:21.892
that that's not some teenager
with an identity crisis,

54:22.050 --> 54:23.643
and now she tells us

54:23.802 --> 54:26.146
that her children are feeling
this thing too, so...

54:26.305 --> 54:30.276
It's a mass illusion,
folie a quatre.

54:30.434 --> 54:33.608
Hysteria is contagious.
Given the right circumstances,

54:33.771 --> 54:36.399
anyone can see and feel things
that simply aren't there.

54:36.565 --> 54:38.533
Her children are just
supporting Mama's delusions.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.535
Okay, classically correct,
sir, but her mind

54:40.694 --> 54:43.447
is giving her very strong
and explicit images.

54:43.614 --> 54:46.458
Why is she going to such lengths
to support this delusion? It--

54:46.617 --> 54:48.415
Phil, look at the record.

54:48.577 --> 54:51.421
She believes that her father
has incestuous desires.

54:51.580 --> 54:55.175
She falls in love with an adolescent,
a typical overgrown kid.

54:55.334 --> 54:57.257
He tries to prove he's
a real man, and he's not.

54:57.419 --> 54:59.092
After which,
she picks up with this...

54:59.254 --> 55:01.427
- Jerry Anderson?
- No, Garrett.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.137
- Oh, Garrett.
- Bob Garrett, right?

55:03.300 --> 55:05.302
A man old enough
to be her father.

55:05.469 --> 55:06.846
See a pattern here?

55:07.012 --> 55:08.889
I think I know what you're suggesting.
I don't know that I agree, though.

55:09.056 --> 55:10.649
- Safe sex.
- PHIL: Well--

55:10.808 --> 55:12.651
It's the story of Carla's life.

55:12.810 --> 55:15.939
She's consistently refused to
get involved in the real thing.

55:16.104 --> 55:19.529
- She has three children.
- What does that prove?

55:19.691 --> 55:21.443
It doesn't take sex
to make babies.

55:21.610 --> 55:23.157
That is a fact
I wasn't aware of.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.947
- Well, now you know.
- Not real sex.

55:25.113 --> 55:26.660
Now, for 32 years,

55:26.824 --> 55:28.952
Carla goes along very smoothly,

55:29.117 --> 55:31.336
and all of a sudden,
she meets this fellow--

55:31.495 --> 55:33.247
- What's his name?
- Jerry Anderson?

55:33.413 --> 55:34.460
- Now you have it.
- Ah, now I'm on it.

55:34.623 --> 55:36.170
Okay. And, pow,

55:36.333 --> 55:40.008
she drifts into
a Dionysian fantasy.

55:40.170 --> 55:43.014
Don't you see?
It's exactly the kind of situation

55:43.173 --> 55:44.516
that can energize
this sort of breakdown.

55:44.675 --> 55:46.052
What, Anderson?

55:46.218 --> 55:48.721
Certainly. A real man. Sure.
She wants the real thing.

55:48.887 --> 55:51.731
No more faking it
with kids and old men.

55:51.890 --> 55:54.985
And faced with the real thing,
Carla buckles.

55:55.143 --> 55:57.396
She falls back
into an infantile reality.

55:57.563 --> 56:00.407
Now, I suggest
you dig a lot deeper.

56:00.566 --> 56:02.159
I think you're
going to find out more,

56:02.317 --> 56:04.194
and maybe you'll find out

56:04.361 --> 56:07.831
that Carla is
not what she seems to be.

56:07.990 --> 56:09.788

Hear, hear.

when you're not around,

57:00.167 --> 57:03.011

Don't go crazy either.

What if I did?

57:18.268 --> 57:19.895
What if I went crazy?

57:22.147 --> 57:24.991
Now, you're not going to go
and do that right now.

57:25.150 --> 57:28.370
What would you do if I did?
Would you leave me?

carrying on tonight?

and take me with you.

You're right.
It was just a pipe dream.

and I have to go through what...

I'm going through.

58:32.718 --> 58:34.436
What you're going through?

telling me everything.

are you going through?

58:37.597 --> 58:38.940

being without you.

01:05:55.994 --> 01:05:57.667
When I graduate,
I'll look for a better job.

01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:00.082
But the one thing I won't do
is to go into any hospital.

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:01.591
Mm-hmm, and you'll
be beaten and frightened.

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:03.877
- No. No.
- No? No? Why not?

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:05.761
'Cause I'm going
to cooperate with him.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:23.484
Carla, you're
a very intelligent woman.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.148
I know you'll always
listen to reason,

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.283
so now I want to talk to you
reasonably, okay?

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:30.036
No more questions
and answers, hmm?

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:33.540
You know, there was a time when people
believed in the supernatural.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.917
Here. I want you
to look at these pictures.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:38.870
Pretty frightening, huh?

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:42.462
Bats, werewolves,
dragons, demons,

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:45.093
all sorts of goblins, okay?

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:48.095
They were supposed
to abuse people sexually.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.973
They were supposed
to impregnate people.

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:53.226
Do you think these things
really exist in there?

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:55.762
- I am not stupid.
- I didn't say you were stupid.

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:57.977
But why do you think these
people saw these things, huh?

01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:00.517
Why do you think
they saw them?

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:03.106
Hmm? Can you take a guess?
Do you know why?

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:06.022
Because it was a way of expressing
something that was frightening to them.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.237
- It has nothing to do with me.
- Wait a second. Carla...

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:09.992
- it has a lot to do with you.
- It has nothing to do with me.

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:11.619
Oh, no, it has a lot
to do with you.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.280
It has an awful lot
to do with you.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:16.290
These ghosts and demons
were only ideas,

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:18.451
but people saw them.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:24.257
Look, Carla, let's say
a man who wanted to be good

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:27.259
had a desire
for his neighbor's wife.

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:30.092
He knows it's wrong,
he feels terrible about it,

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.508
but the desire
is growing and growing.

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:35.302
Desire can be a very frightening
and powerful sensation.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.597
How does he deal with it?
He invents a creature,

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:41.562
an evil, ugly,
evil-tempered creature

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:44.568
which is just a picture
of his own desire, Carla.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:46.445
I have no need of inventing
anything, Dr. Sneiderman.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:49.073
Come on, Carla, stop it.
You have a lot of need.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:50.484
You were scared
of your daddy.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:51.822
He was a minister.
He held you in a way

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:53.237
- he shouldn't have held you.
- Stop it.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:54.871
- You were pregnant at 16.
- Oh, shut up!

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:56.497
A drug-crazed guy
went off and killed himself.

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:57.748
- Stop it!
- Another guy left you

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.409
with two kids.
Now, Carla, stop it!

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:03.171
Come on. Do the work, Carla.
What was evil to your family?

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:05.832
All sorts of things were evil
to my family. You know that.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.592
Carla, we know your family well enough
to know what was evil to them.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.172
As a child, you knew
what was evil to him. What?

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.838
- Sex. They were afraid of sex.
- Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.552
They were afraid of sex.
Exactly.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:16.264
So let's use our imagination
a little bit, okay?

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:17.769
Let's try putting
some things together.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:19.395
Like a dream,
it's getting all mixed up.

01:08:19.554 --> 01:08:20.897
Your creature is
a symbol, Carla.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:22.398
A symbol of what?

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:24.104
I don't know yet.
Maybe we'll find out.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:27.111
Could be a specific person,
a fear of someone, a desire...

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:29.773
No, I'm not hiding
from anybody or anything!

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.033
Carla. Carla, let's talk
about your visitor friend, okay?

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:35.866
- Dr. Sneiderman, I'm so sick of this.
- Take a good look at him.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:37.576
What do we know
about him, Carla?

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.207
Come on. Let's use your words.
What do we know about him?

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:41.959
We know that he is big,
we know that he is strong.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.041
It's frightening how strong
this guy is, isn't it?

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.955
You told me,
unbelievably strong.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:48.466
So why does he need help?
But he has two helpers, right?

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.969
Two little ones? Right?
Those are your words.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.629
One big one
and two little ones.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.138
- Oh, you're obscene.
- Billy's a good-looking kid.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.549
What you're suggesting
is obscene.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:56.886
- He's a strong kid.
- You're obscene!

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.471
You're having
trouble with Jerry, and--

01:08:58.635 --> 01:08:59.978
- You're obscene.
- Carla, calm-- Carla!

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.138
- I'll calm down, but not here!
- Carla!

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.898
Shit.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:13.571
He was talking about
two little ones and a big one.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.577
He was implying that I wanted
to make love with Billy.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:18.738
(SIRENS PASSING)

01:09:20.238 --> 01:09:21.957
It was just obscene, you know?

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:23.459
- Really.
- It was obscene.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.961
There's no other word for it.

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.337
No. I think
he just pushed too far.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.465
He pushed too far. It was disgusting.
It was sickening.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.671
I mean, I know he has to probe
into painful areas

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.131
- and everything, but...
- That's not probing.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.761
I'm not going back.
I'm never going back.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.389
Oh, no. Wait a minute.
Maybe you're overreacting

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:38.015
- a little bit, Carla.
- I'm never going back.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:39.300
- Honey?
- What?

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.265
- You ready to go?
- Yes, I am, George.

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.270
Just give me a minute, please.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.103
Well, I'm going to get the car,
'cause I don't want to be late.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.108
Okay, honey.
No, we're not going to be late.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.904
I don't want
to cause any trouble...

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.439
- No.
- between you and George.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.279
I shouldn't have barged in.
I should have called.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:56.784
No, no, no. We just have

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.661
- to make an appearance...
- I just wanted to talk.

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.289
At this boring wedding reception.
It's important to George, you know?

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.324
Well, I'm going
to see you tomorrow.

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:04.492
No, I want you to stay here.

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:06.536
We're going to be back
in less than an hour.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:07.875
Now come on, Carla.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.914
I need to talk to you
some more about this.

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:12.129
Carla...

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.464
will you wait here
until I get back?

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.379
- Yeah.
- Please. You look so tired.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.423
Why don't you sit down
and have something to eat?

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:20.136
- (CAR HORN HONKS)
- Have fun.

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:22.393
Okay. I'll see you
in a little bit.

How's everything? Okay?

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.924
Dr. Sneiderman?
You didn't tell him where I was?

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.088
I don't want to talk to him.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:02.099
Good.
Look, you have the number here.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.260
If there's any problem,
call me, okay?

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.771
I'll be home
in a couple of hours.

She couldn't
have done all this.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:27.653
We both saw it
with our own eyes.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.822
We stood right there
and saw it, George.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:31.332

at Rogers McGibbon, okay?

No. It's just
not that good a case.

fits the classic patterns.

the appearance of an apparition.

of objects

and went crazy,

than any earthquake.

to get the kids out,

- He's out in the garage.

- You can talk to him if--
- Door slam like that?

couldn't get out of it.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:58.391
They're asleep right now,
and I don't want to disturb them.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:15:59.931
Did they sleep
through this whole attack?

01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:01.940
Yeah, they managed
to sleep through it.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:04.443
- Sound sleepers.
- They are.

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:06.229
It's one of the good things
about kids.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:10.529
The living room.

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:12.364
This is where Billy
got the lightning.

01:16:12.526 --> 01:16:14.199
It was like it was lightning
going into him,

01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:15.829
and he fell down.
He broke his wrist--

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:17.240
By lightning, you mean
an electrical discharge?

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.749
I don't know what it was.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:20.376
It was like lightning
was going into him

01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:22.207
- and I was on the couch.
- Like an arc?

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:25.873
Was it kind of like...

Mrs. Moran, please understand.
We want to believe you.

We want to believe you
very much, but it's--

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.387
It's just we want to do it
right, Mrs. Moran.

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:37.643
- You want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:39.770
Yeah. That'd be real nice.

I wasn't lying.

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:22.930
Mrs. Moran,

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:26.647
I think it might be worthwhile
after all for us to set up

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.903
some of the equipment
we've got with us in the car.

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:30.904
Yeah.

Yeah.

like it were alive
and she knew it.

Isn't it possible
she was hallucinating?

a hallucination?

with the traditional world

to do that.

when the time comes.

would you, please?

and in the closets.

(LAUGHS) Yeah. We're leaving
no stone unturned,

- but thanks for the tip.
- Sure.

we got some highly interesting

- Did you?

You missed
your appointment yesterday.

01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:24.542

- Really?
- Mmmmm.

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:35.929
Look, is there someplace
that we could go and talk?

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:39.189
Yeah.

01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:42.309
I can't blame you
for not coming back.

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:44.149
I really did push
a little too hard.

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:46.313
I think you need
to understand something.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.403
I feel very fine now.

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:50.442
There are no more attacks.
I have no reason to see you.

That's what those guys
are looking for, fantasies.

01:23:58.367 --> 01:23:59.789
No, they have photographs.

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:02.454
Okay.

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:05.465
Look, Carla,
how about you and me,

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:08.127
we make a bargain, okay?

01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:11.137
You can see me and still...

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:13.970
have your scientist friends
help you.

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:15.725
I don't see any point in that.

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:17.386
Well, it's like seeing
two different doctors,

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:19.396
you know,
getting different opinions,

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:21.102
a bone specialist
and a blood specialist.

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:23.063
- They work together.
- No, I'd rather not.

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:24.647
Why?
What have we got to lose?

01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:27.897
I believed in you.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:29.565
You know I did.

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:32.860
I really needed to believe in you.
But every time you discovered

01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:35.074
something new about me,
something worse happened,

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:37.740
and I got sick of hearing
that it would all go away

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:40.204
as soon as we got down to the basic
problem, as though it was in me.

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:42.369
It is in you, Carla.

01:24:44.288 --> 01:24:46.211
I think you better leave.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:55.466
- Hi, Billy.
- Hi.

01:24:55.632 --> 01:24:58.181
- Billy. Billy!
- Yeah?

01:24:58.343 --> 01:24:59.811
- Look, would you do me a favor?
- What?

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:01.597
Don't pretend next time.

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:03.857
The next time your mother
thinks she sees something

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:05.814
or she hears something,
she wants you to corroborate it,

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:07.603
and when you do, it's that much
more difficult to convince her

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.442
that it's all in her head,
it's a delusion.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.073
I didn't get a broken arm
by pretending.

01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:12.699
Look, Billy, there's a lot
of logical explanations

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:14.360
that could have caused
something like this.

01:25:14.526 --> 01:25:16.779
All I'm telling you, that is,
if you care about your mom,

01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.367
you will not pretend next time.

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:20.578
I care about my mother, yeah.
But I was not pretending.

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:22.243
I'm not lying to you.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.928
Want to know
why she's not coming back?

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:34.759
- Mmmmm.
- She's fallen in with some schmucks

01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:37.265
who are supporting her fantasies.
You ought to see her house.

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:40.143
They're watching her visitations,
got it all wired to look for poltergei--

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:41.474
- Entities.
- Wait a minute.

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:42.889
That's what they called it,
an entity.

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:44.272
- What schmucks?
- I don't know.

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:45.774
They say they're
from the university here.

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:47.229
parapsychology.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.110
Ooh.

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:50.691
A Dr. Cooley.

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:52.197
- Elizabeth Cooley.
- Yeah.

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:53.858
parapsychology.

01:25:54.024 --> 01:25:56.527
It's fly-by-night psychology.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.491
Okay. So how do we
get rid of 'em?

01:25:58.654 --> 01:25:59.997
Well, not very easily.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.328
I mean, these are
not snake-oil peddlers, Phil.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.334
These are supposedly
academic brethren.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:06.120
Academic brethren, bullshit.

01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:08.004
Come on. They're dangerous.
They're feeding her delusion.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.631
By the time
they get through with her,

01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:11.792
she's really going to be
off her rocker or worse.

01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:13.881
Well, there's not much
you can do,

01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:16.593
not legally or medically.

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:19.634
It's her life, her house,
her delusions.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.644
No, until she crosses
the line of legal sanity,

01:26:22.803 --> 01:26:24.771
nobody can touch her.

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:30.894

Come on, show yourself,
you coward.

01:26:57.754 --> 01:26:59.427
Now that I've got
my forces here with me,

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:02.138

how brave you are.

(ZAPPING)

01:27:21.027 --> 01:27:23.576
Is that all
you got the guts to do?

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:28.327
A couple of itty-bitty lights?
Come on.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:30.962
We don't want fireworks.
We want you!

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:33.340
Show yourself, damn you!

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:44.013
Are you trapped
in this environment?

01:27:46.887 --> 01:27:50.141
COOLEY:
Will you appear to us now?

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:55.195
You won't appear.

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:59.862
You won't appear, because you're
a devil out of hell,

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:01.823
and you're afraid.

01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:06.331
You'll wait till I'm alone,
won't you?

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:09.790
Then you'll come forth to hurt me,
to hurt my children.

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:42.443
Show yourself.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.406
Show yourself.

Joe, turn on the lights.

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:38.332
Did you see it?

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.592
Yes, Mrs. Moran.
We saw it.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.337
Thank you.
Would you excuse us?

01:29:54.264 --> 01:29:56.107
- Is it over?
- For now.

01:29:56.266 --> 01:29:58.940
Yeah? Are you okay?

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.230
All right. Okay, then I'm going
to go to bed, okay?

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:02.739
- Okay.
- Good night.

01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:04.571
- Good night.
- I'll see you.

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:06.360
- Good night, Billy.
- Excuse me.

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

01:30:09.779 --> 01:30:11.907
Thank you.
We'll be leaving shortly.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.825
What are you two doing up?

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:16.836
- Is everything okay?
- We heard you, Mommy.

Everything's fine.
Come on.

01:30:19.706 --> 01:30:22.380
Well?

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:25.762
I've never seen
anything like it before.

01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:28.674
Do you think that we were
in some kind of hypnotic state

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.844
and that this was
a mass hallucination?

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.438
I've always believed

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:38.441
that there were several planes
of existence,

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.944
distinct and separate...

01:30:42.479 --> 01:30:45.824
and we, as human beings,
inhabit only one.

01:30:47.734 --> 01:30:51.580
Isn't it possible that some sort
of external intelligence,

01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:54.036
some discarnate entity,

01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:56.622
has crossed into
our plane of existence?

01:30:56.785 --> 01:30:58.503
How are we going to prove it?

01:30:58.662 --> 01:31:01.256
We have to isolate it.

01:31:01.414 --> 01:31:03.633
We have to draw it in somehow,

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:06.466
find a way to bring it into
a controlled situation.

Yeah, me too.

- Good night, Mrs. Moran.
- Thank you.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.274
We've got some real good ideas
on how to proceed.

Thanks a lot.

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:27.153
- You've got the tape, right?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:33.325
- Jerry.
- Hi, cutie.

Excuse me.

- What gives?
- Why didn't you call?

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:44.671
I did. Every time, I got
a different voice on the line.

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:47.006
What's going on?

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:49.671
Those people
are from the university.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.340
The university?

01:31:52.966 --> 01:31:55.765
I missed you.
Look at me. I'm shaking.

01:31:55.927 --> 01:31:58.396
I think we'd better
have a drink.

01:31:58.555 --> 01:32:00.273
Got some good wine.

01:32:00.432 --> 01:32:04.562
Um, yeah, well, you go ahead.
I don't think I'd really better.

01:32:04.728 --> 01:32:06.321
No, no,
you're going to have one.

01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:08.231
This is my homecoming.
Come on.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:11.860
What was that all about?

01:32:14.612 --> 01:32:16.614
They're trying to help.

01:32:16.781 --> 01:32:20.160
- Help who?
- Me.

01:32:20.326 --> 01:32:21.828
I don't know what you mean.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.383
I've been sick, Jerry.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:30.341
Sick? What kind of sick?

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:33.347
Things have come to me...

01:32:33.506 --> 01:32:35.099
in the night.

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:39.395
- Nightmares, you mean?
- Yeah.

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:41.648
Like nightmares. Exactly.

01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:45.276
I mean, those people
you saw in the house,

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:47.437
they're psychologists.
They're doctors,

01:32:47.604 --> 01:32:50.448
and they have a theory
that there's something

01:32:50.607 --> 01:32:53.451
in the house that...

01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:55.328
is keeping me from sleeping,

01:32:55.487 --> 01:32:58.457
and they're trying to fix it.

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:02.619
Some of them looked pretty young
to be doctors.

01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:06.669
- Oh, you're mad.
- No, it's not a question of mad.

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.674
- Yeah, okay, since you ask.
- Yeah, you're mad.

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:11.427
I mean, who brings
a university full of kids

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:12.929
into their house
because they can't sleep?

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:15.967
You can't sleep, you take a pill.
You go see a regular doctor.

01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:18.055
I'm not giving a party, Jerry.
I'm really not.

01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:20.141
Hey, all I'm asking for
is a simple explanation.

01:33:20.303 --> 01:33:21.600
I still don't know
what's bugging you.

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:23.106
- Yeah.
- Don't treat me like a jerk.

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:24.732
- I'm not a jerk, okay, Carly?
- I'm sorry.

01:33:24.891 --> 01:33:27.269
Trust me. Just tell me
what the hell's happening.

01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:31.781
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know--

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:34.784
I don't know the difference

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:36.741
between what is happening

01:33:36.903 --> 01:33:39.531
and what I think
might be happening.

01:33:39.697 --> 01:33:42.826
The only thing I know for certain
is that it started when you left.

01:33:42.992 --> 01:33:45.086
And I don't say that
with any kind of blame

01:33:45.245 --> 01:33:47.293
or accusation,
but that is when it started.

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:49.958
When what started, Carly?
What?

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:54.129
All right.

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:58.266
Okay. I was--

01:33:58.424 --> 01:34:00.847
I was attacked.
And it's not happening now,

01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:02.307
so don't worry,
but I was attacked.

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:03.938
You were attacked?
By who? Who attacked you?

01:34:04.097 --> 01:34:05.223
- Nobody. Nobody.
- You were attacked?

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:06.391
No, nobody. Nobody.

01:34:08.518 --> 01:34:10.361

This sounds so crazy.

01:34:12.063 --> 01:34:14.862
I mean, it was like
a horrible dream.

01:34:15.024 --> 01:34:16.617
Shit. I don't know
how to explain it.

01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:19.245
It sounds crazy
every time I explain it.

01:34:19.404 --> 01:34:21.498
- Ohh.
- It sounds crazy.

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:23.329

01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:27.294
Oh, Carla.

01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:29.547
Do you know, for a second,
you had me worried?

01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:31.504
I mean, I thought
you were really attacked.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.009
I thought that somebody
attacked you.

that these dreams

or nightmares
or whatever the hell they are

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:52.566
will never bother you again.

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:57.609
Because I'm staying this time.
No more trips.

01:34:57.775 --> 01:35:00.619
No more one-night stands, baby.

01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:03.782

it's going to be forever.

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:22.175
Hey, can we go to your place?

01:35:22.342 --> 01:35:25.562
Uh-uh.
Remember, I'm with you,

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.688
and as long as I am,

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:29.770
nothing bad is going to happen.

01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:41.987
You'll see.

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:48.501
Oh.

- Mmm.
- It's pure silk.

Stop it. Stop it.

01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:37.397
- Get off her.
- Help me.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.403
- Help me.
- Stop it!

01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:41.940
Stop it!

01:37:42.106 --> 01:37:43.904
You son of a bitch!

01:37:45.943 --> 01:37:49.117
You fucking bastard!
You son of a bitch!

01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:54.335
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Dr. Bronstein, Dr. Loomis...

01:37:54.494 --> 01:37:55.791
Okay. She's going
to be all right.

01:37:55.953 --> 01:37:57.455
- Yeah?
- She's still a little shaky,

01:37:57.622 --> 01:37:59.499
so when you go in,
don't stay too long, okay?

01:37:59.665 --> 01:38:01.212
- All right.
- Okay. All right. Go in.

01:38:01.376 --> 01:38:02.923
Go in.
She's dying to see you.

01:38:03.086 --> 01:38:04.429
Make a right
at the corner there.

01:38:04.587 --> 01:38:05.930
- BILL: First right?
- First door on your right.

01:38:06.089 --> 01:38:07.386
- Thanks a lot.
- You got it.

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:09.050
Don't stay too long.
Please don't.

01:38:11.969 --> 01:38:13.767
Okay, Jerry,
she's going to be okay.

01:38:13.930 --> 01:38:15.682
It was just
a slight concussion.

01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:19.394
Thank God for that, Doctor.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.937
Thank God.

01:38:21.104 --> 01:38:22.777
Look, why don't you
go in and see her?

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:24.816
She'd like to see you.

01:38:24.982 --> 01:38:27.155
No way, Doctor.

01:38:27.318 --> 01:38:29.412
I can't be around her.

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:31.038
I can't handle
what's going on in there.

01:38:31.197 --> 01:38:32.449
Come on, Jerry.
What do you mean

01:38:32.615 --> 01:38:34.083
you can't handle it?
She needs you now.

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:36.085
I mean, I loved her.

01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:40.714
I was going to marry her,
you know.

01:38:40.873 --> 01:38:44.002
I could've taken anything,
I mean, a disease, cancer.

01:38:44.168 --> 01:38:46.421
This is a disease, Jerry.
It's the same thing.

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:47.839
Not what she's
got living with her.

01:38:48.005 --> 01:38:50.133
Jerry, it's just
a disease now, okay?

01:38:50.299 --> 01:38:51.721
Now just get it
through your head.

01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:53.557
It's just in her head.
There was nobody there.

01:38:53.719 --> 01:38:55.016
Nobody was there.

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:56.647
Don't tell me that.
There was somebody there.

01:38:56.806 --> 01:38:58.058
- Okay. Okay.
- I mean, there was.

01:38:58.224 --> 01:38:59.771
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

01:38:59.934 --> 01:39:02.357
I couldn't see him with my eyes,
but there was somebody there.

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.239
I see this--

01:39:05.398 --> 01:39:07.275
like something is pressing her.

01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:08.910
It's pushing her.

01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:12.072
I see her breasts
are being touched.

01:39:14.073 --> 01:39:16.292
I mean, I see her breasts
are being squeezed by fingers,

01:39:16.451 --> 01:39:18.294
only I can't see the fingers.

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:21.539
I'm sorry.

01:39:21.706 --> 01:39:23.424
That's okay. That's okay.

01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:28.008
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing here?

01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:29.673
We're visiting a friend.

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:35.728
- I got to go now.
- No, no. Oh, Jerry, look.

01:39:35.887 --> 01:39:37.764
She needs you now.
She needs you now a lot.

01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:39.603
It's okay. It's okay.
I really have to go.

01:39:39.765 --> 01:39:41.267
Hey, Jerry--

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:45.280
- NURSE: Look at me.
- GENE: Thanks for calling, Billy.

01:39:45.438 --> 01:39:47.941
- Come on.
- No. I want to stay with Mommy.

01:39:48.107 --> 01:39:50.075
Come on.
We've got to go.

01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:52.612
- I'll talk to you later, Mom.
- Okay.

01:39:52.778 --> 01:39:54.701
I hope you're all right,
Mrs. Moran.

01:39:54.864 --> 01:39:56.958
NURSE:
I'll be back.

01:39:57.116 --> 01:39:59.289
We never should've left
the house. I'm sorry.

01:39:59.452 --> 01:40:03.127
Maybe this doesn't seem
like the best time for this,

01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:05.041
but we're afraid for you.

01:40:06.584 --> 01:40:09.633
JOE: We have an idea
that might help.

01:40:09.795 --> 01:40:13.390
We want to try to isolate
this thing and immobilize it.

01:40:13.549 --> 01:40:15.847
COOLEY:
We need your consent.

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.980
That means going into it
with your eyes wide open.

01:40:19.138 --> 01:40:22.984
What we have in mind
has never been tried before.

01:40:23.142 --> 01:40:26.396
We'll take
every possible precaution.

01:40:30.775 --> 01:40:33.494
I'll do anything...

01:40:33.653 --> 01:40:35.781
to get rid of him.

01:40:38.741 --> 01:40:40.835
That guy Jerry was
her only contact with reality.

01:40:40.993 --> 01:40:43.087
I want those two guys
banished from her life.

01:40:43.246 --> 01:40:45.795
I don't see what I can do.

01:40:45.957 --> 01:40:48.631
Well, go to the dean.
Maybe he can do something.

01:40:48.793 --> 01:40:50.545
Maybe he can
pull those creeps back.

01:40:52.088 --> 01:40:53.840
Do you realize
what you're asking?

01:40:54.006 --> 01:40:55.724
- That's a month-long debate...
- Right.

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:57.977
And it could get
very complicated.

01:40:59.595 --> 01:41:01.689
All this for Carla Moran?

01:41:03.599 --> 01:41:06.273
Somebody's got
to look after her.

01:41:06.435 --> 01:41:08.529
Let her go, Phil.

01:41:08.688 --> 01:41:11.862
You don't have any choice,
professionally or personally.

01:41:14.402 --> 01:41:18.032
GENE: As you can see,
this is a freshly cut rose,

01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:21.041
and this is a container
of liquid helium,

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.453
473 degrees below zero.

01:41:23.619 --> 01:41:25.417
This is the coldest substance
known to man.

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.002
Anything frozen
at this temperature

01:41:27.164 --> 01:41:29.383
will shatter
at the slightest touch.

01:41:45.099 --> 01:41:47.773
What we are seeking
is to determine

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.358
if this entity has mass.

01:41:50.521 --> 01:41:52.740
If in fact this is the case,

01:41:52.898 --> 01:41:55.526
then we should be able
to freeze it,

01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:57.946
verify its objective existence,

01:41:58.112 --> 01:42:00.160
and prove that it isn't
just a psychic projection...

01:42:00.323 --> 01:42:01.745
It's going to work great,
isn't it?

01:42:01.907 --> 01:42:04.660
...but rather an independent
force from some other

01:42:04.827 --> 01:42:07.751
level of reality
that has never been isolated.

01:42:07.913 --> 01:42:10.007
Here she is.

01:42:12.251 --> 01:42:14.253
Mrs. Moran.

01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:18.091
Let me take your bag.

01:42:18.257 --> 01:42:20.305
It's good to see you.

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:23.472
We're all very excited
to get the experiment under way.

01:42:26.057 --> 01:42:28.435
- Welcome.
- GENE: Mrs. Moran.

01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:30.319
See you later.

01:42:32.855 --> 01:42:35.108
Have you made arrangements
for your children?

01:42:35.274 --> 01:42:38.244
- They're with a friend.
- Good.

01:42:38.402 --> 01:42:41.030
Let me show you
to your new house.

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:45.080
I'm afraid we're not able

01:42:45.242 --> 01:42:47.620
to provide you
with all the conveniences,

01:42:47.787 --> 01:42:51.291
but we hope
you'll find it comfortable

01:42:51.457 --> 01:42:54.461
- and familiar.
- JOE: Watch your step.

01:42:57.922 --> 01:43:01.142
I think everyone's done a terrific
job in recreating your home.

01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:03.302
We did use different colors
on the walls.

01:43:03.469 --> 01:43:06.393
And there are other differences.
No light switches.

01:43:06.555 --> 01:43:09.525
We have to control
the electricity.

01:43:09.684 --> 01:43:12.654
This, of course,
is the children's room.

01:43:12.812 --> 01:43:15.031
Yeah, the bed's
in the wrong place.

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:17.612
Well, doesn't matter.

01:43:17.775 --> 01:43:19.743
There are no ceilings
anywhere in the house.

01:43:19.902 --> 01:43:21.404
That's for
the television monitoring.

01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:25.958
Except, of course,
in the bathroom.

01:43:26.117 --> 01:43:30.167
There is a ceiling,
but no plumbing.

01:43:30.329 --> 01:43:32.832
We'll supply you
with all the water you need.

01:43:32.998 --> 01:43:35.171
That's a chemical toilet.

01:43:38.254 --> 01:43:40.222
Does this look familiar?

01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:41.974
It's a good simulation.

01:43:49.515 --> 01:43:51.859
And remember
not to change in here.

01:43:52.017 --> 01:43:54.611
The television camera
will be watching you,

01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:58.195
and Gene at the controls.

01:44:00.276 --> 01:44:04.031
COOLEY: Now, in the kitchen,
we had a bit of a problem.

01:44:04.196 --> 01:44:07.040
No gas, but we have a hot plate

01:44:07.199 --> 01:44:09.543
and a well-stocked refrigerator.

01:44:09.702 --> 01:44:11.670
It's like camping out.

01:44:16.584 --> 01:44:20.259
Mrs. Moran, I'd like
to show you something now.

01:44:22.423 --> 01:44:24.096
Looks a lot like your house,
doesn't it?

01:44:24.258 --> 01:44:26.886
The living room.
Brought your books.

01:44:27.052 --> 01:44:29.180
Just stand over here with me.

01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:41.530
Mrs. Moran, this is the protected area
that we were talking about.

01:44:41.692 --> 01:44:43.694
It's two pieces of double-thick,
heat-treated glass

01:44:43.861 --> 01:44:45.829
with a vacuum
in between the panes.

01:44:45.988 --> 01:44:48.832
Now, the system is fail-safe.
We can't activate the helium

01:44:48.991 --> 01:44:51.039
until you're safely
behind this enclosure,

01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:53.671
so when we tell you to go
to the protected area,

01:44:53.829 --> 01:44:55.627
we want you to come
directly to this spot

01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:58.418
as quickly as possible,
and we'll take care of the rest.

01:45:06.509 --> 01:45:09.729
Okay?
Now we have to get ready.

01:45:09.887 --> 01:45:12.481
You make yourself
as comfortable as you can,

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:14.483
but you're not alone.

01:45:14.642 --> 01:45:17.111
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

01:45:19.647 --> 01:45:21.570
I'm not afraid.

01:45:23.067 --> 01:45:25.320
If you can get him,

01:45:25.486 --> 01:45:27.454
I'm not afraid.

01:45:27.613 --> 01:45:30.457
Hey. Where do you think
you're going?

01:45:30.616 --> 01:45:32.789
- Is this the Cooley experiment?
- Yeah.

01:45:32.952 --> 01:45:35.705
Yeah, I'm with the Medical
Institute, Dr. Sneiderman.

01:45:35.871 --> 01:45:37.669
- Go right on in, Doctor.
- Thank you.

01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:41.627
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:46:08.362 --> 01:46:09.784
Carla.

01:46:09.947 --> 01:46:11.995
I'd like to talk to you alone.

01:46:12.157 --> 01:46:16.037
Is there any place
that we could go talk?

01:46:19.832 --> 01:46:21.334
That we could talk privately?

01:46:22.626 --> 01:46:24.128
The bathroom.

01:46:35.139 --> 01:46:37.938
This is quite a setup they have.

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:42.276
They made a natural environment
for him so he'll come here.

01:46:42.438 --> 01:46:45.282
Really? Is that
what they're telling you?

01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:46.863
That's what they're doing.

01:46:47.026 --> 01:46:48.949
Uh-huh.
And you believe them?

01:46:49.111 --> 01:46:51.239
Oh, yes.

01:46:51.405 --> 01:46:54.625
They're dangerous frauds, Carla.
You're their guinea pig.

01:46:57.453 --> 01:46:59.831
Carla, do you know
that there are tanks

01:46:59.997 --> 01:47:01.544
of liquid helium outside?
Did you know that?

01:47:01.707 --> 01:47:03.050
- Mm-hmm.
- You do?

01:47:03.208 --> 01:47:04.676
Do you know
what liquid helium can do?

01:47:04.835 --> 01:47:06.382
- Of course.
- Of course. Really?

01:47:06.545 --> 01:47:08.923
You understand what it means
to stop all molecular motion,

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:11.183
paralyze atomic particles,
decompose matter?

01:47:11.342 --> 01:47:13.595
- Okay,
- Okay?

01:47:13.761 --> 01:47:16.435
What do you mean, okay?

01:47:16.597 --> 01:47:17.940
I mean I'd rather be dead

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:20.692
than living the way
I've been living.

01:47:20.851 --> 01:47:22.694
Do you understand that?

01:47:22.853 --> 01:47:25.151
Yes, I can understand that.

01:47:25.314 --> 01:47:27.737
Yes. I also understand

01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:30.744
that I care very much
what happens to you,

01:47:30.903 --> 01:47:33.406
very much.

01:47:33.572 --> 01:47:36.872
And I know that, in your heart,

01:47:37.034 --> 01:47:40.288
you know the difference
between reality and fantasy.

01:47:41.622 --> 01:47:43.841
Carla, look at me. Carla.

01:47:43.999 --> 01:47:45.467
Our reason, our intelligence,

01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:47.048
that's the only thing
that distinguishes us

01:47:47.211 --> 01:47:49.009
between any other species
of animal.

01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:50.844
Carla, I care about you.

01:47:51.006 --> 01:47:53.475
Carla, don't close
yourself off now.

01:47:53.634 --> 01:47:56.979
It's real important, real important
that you maintain contact

01:47:57.137 --> 01:48:00.391

Wait up a minute, will you?

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:34.808
Really.
I want to talk to you.

01:48:34.967 --> 01:48:36.810
I got to hand it to you.

01:48:36.969 --> 01:48:39.392
You just don't give up.

harm one hair on her head...

You see this face?
I don't want to see it again.

you may have them all fooled,
but not me.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:02.123
I'm going to nail you
and that little creep.

01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:05.999

I can taste it.

Dr. Sneiderman is here

to sound you out on this.

Yes, I realize
it's your decision.

01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:29.210
I can't figure him anymore.

01:50:29.373 --> 01:50:31.421
Do we really need his approval?

01:50:31.583 --> 01:50:34.336
You need to learn a lot
about campus politics.

I'm going to get her away
from those lunatics.

01:50:47.641 --> 01:50:50.440
Why not give her the option
of tripping that glass enclosure

01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:52.275
- herself from down there?
- Too dangerous.

01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:17.884
I want her out of here, Doctor.

to be all right.

Yeah. I just don't like
to see anybody...

- Just try to calm yourself.
- hurt.

01:51:32.561 --> 01:51:35.314
He's going to be upstairs
with us in the booth.

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:38.984
