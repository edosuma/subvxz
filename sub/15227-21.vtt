01:17.443 --> 01:18.943
Whoo! Hi!

01:19.011 --> 01:20.711
Hoo! That was some run, huh?

01:20.779 --> 01:23.615
I can't believe
      we did eight miles.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.550
Wow! You ran eight miles?

01:25.618 --> 01:27.319
No, no, no, no,
       I ran eight miles.

01:27.386 --> 01:29.254
He drove alongside in his cab.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.656
Well, the heater was stuck.

01:31.724 --> 01:34.759
It was like an oven in there.

01:34.826 --> 01:37.562
My body can't take
      that kind of strain.

01:37.629 --> 01:41.332
Hey, Banta, There's an article
       in <i>Boxing Monthly</i>

01:41.400 --> 01:44.302
about that fighter you're
   fightin' on Tuesday night.

01:44.369 --> 01:46.905
Oh, Gentry?
  Oh, let me see, let me see.

01:46.972 --> 01:48.773
Oh, no, no, uh,
           let me, let me, uh...

01:48.841 --> 01:51.709
let me, let me read you
    a couple of choice passages.

01:51.777 --> 01:58.683
"Gentry's left hand
                  is a bludgeon.

01:58.751 --> 02:02.187
It has removed more teeth
      than trench mouth."

02:02.254 --> 02:03.521
Boy, the press loves him, huh?

02:03.589 --> 02:06.358
Look at this guy.
         He's 15 and 0.

02:06.425 --> 02:07.592
He's ranked by the WBC.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.394
This is my big chance.

02:09.461 --> 02:12.129
You know, I could really make
    a name for myself, Lou.

02:12.197 --> 02:15.133
Yeah, "Gums Banta."

02:15.201 --> 02:18.436
Tony, I have a question

02:18.504 --> 02:19.937
about this guy
you're gonna fight.

02:20.005 --> 02:21.906
Yeah, oh, yeah,
         yeah, I know.

02:21.974 --> 02:24.909
How'd I ever get a fight
  with a major contender, huh?

02:24.977 --> 02:26.678
Not how. Why?

02:26.746 --> 02:29.146
I mean, look at the last guy
Gentry fought.

02:29.214 --> 02:31.583
His face looks
like it's inside out.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.451
Is that how
you wanna end up?

02:33.519 --> 02:35.921
You mean, with a color photo
       in <i>Boxing Monthly?</i>

02:35.988 --> 02:38.122
You bet. Oh, boy!

02:38.190 --> 02:44.729
Boy, it musta taken a lotta
 stitches to close up that gap.

02:44.797 --> 02:47.332
Jim, that's his mouth.

02:49.768 --> 02:51.669
How 'bout gettin' outta
        those nifty togs

02:51.737 --> 02:54.806
and let's get some cabs
       on the road here?

02:54.874 --> 02:56.874
Yeah, well, I'm gonna take
        a shower first.

02:56.942 --> 02:57.675
Why?

02:57.743 --> 02:58.676
Because I'm sweaty

02:58.743 --> 02:59.844
and I'm smelly, that's why.

02:59.912 --> 03:01.112
Well, so is Lupus.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.548
You don't see him wasting
         company time.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.550
I'll see you guys at Mario's
        after the shift.

03:05.618 --> 03:06.550
Okay.

03:06.618 --> 03:08.019
Oh, uh, I can't make it.

03:08.086 --> 03:09.487
I got a date with Vicki.

03:09.555 --> 03:10.855
Ooh, you guys
have been seeing

03:10.923 --> 03:12.223
a lot of
each other, huh?

03:12.291 --> 03:13.758
Yeah, well, you know,
     she's real special, Elaine.

03:13.825 --> 03:14.993
She's got this
                knack, you know.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.595
No matter where we are,
   it could be the crummiest,

03:17.663 --> 03:20.398
sleaziest joint,
       she fits right in.

03:20.466 --> 03:23.301
Come on. I wanna get some cabs
          on the road.

03:23.368 --> 03:24.535
Nardo, 218.

03:24.603 --> 03:25.970
ELAINE:
I'll see you
guys later.

03:26.038 --> 03:27.004
Iggy, 305

03:27.072 --> 03:29.674
Lupus, 411

03:29.742 --> 03:32.142
Uh, Lupus, here,
   I bought you one of these,

03:32.210 --> 03:34.412
uh, little pine trees
      to put in your cab.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.251
Go on! Go on!

03:39.318 --> 03:41.786
Chehala, 710.

03:41.854 --> 03:44.589
Uh, Grew, 814.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.358
Hey, Vicki.

03:47.426 --> 03:48.393
Hi, Tony.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.460
What's the matter, huh?

03:49.528 --> 03:50.761
You were supposed
              to see me tonight.

03:50.829 --> 03:52.063
You couldn't wait,
                       huh, huh?

03:52.131 --> 03:53.064
(laughs)
Knock it off.

03:53.132 --> 03:54.399
You're getting sweat
all over me.

03:54.466 --> 03:56.300
You love it.
                    You love it.

03:56.368 --> 03:57.435
Oh!

03:57.503 --> 03:58.836
Listen, I just
stopped by

03:58.904 --> 04:01.773
to tell you that, uh,
I'm not gonna be able

04:01.840 --> 04:04.909
to make it later
and, uh, I gotta go now.

04:04.977 --> 04:06.310
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

04:06.378 --> 04:07.379
Where ya goin'?

04:07.446 --> 04:09.114
I've got
a doctor's appointment.

04:09.181 --> 04:10.615
Well, what's wrong?

04:11.950 --> 04:14.285
Oh, I don't want
tell you here

04:14.353 --> 04:17.221
in front
of all these people.

04:17.289 --> 04:19.656
Well, uh, come here
              someplace private.

04:19.725 --> 04:20.658
Hop in.

04:23.195 --> 04:24.395
Yeah, yeah.

04:24.463 --> 04:30.234
So, uh, what's wrong?
            You don't look sick.

04:30.302 --> 04:31.403
Ha-ha!

04:31.470 --> 04:33.737
I'm late.
                    Ah, so what?

04:33.805 --> 04:36.307
Doctors keep you waiting in
     their offices all the time.

04:36.375 --> 04:38.576
No, no, I'm not late
for my appointment.

04:38.644 --> 04:40.845
I'm late
for my monthly visit.

04:40.912 --> 04:42.746
You're gonna go see
       your mother first.

04:42.814 --> 04:43.982
Oh, Vicki.

04:44.049 --> 04:47.719
No, Tony,
I missed my period.

04:49.855 --> 04:53.091
I think I might be pregnant.

04:55.194 --> 04:58.028
How'd that happen?

04:58.096 --> 04:59.763
I mean, you're
              always so careful.

04:59.831 --> 05:01.932
I mean, what about all those
           precautions you take?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.035
I don't take any precautions.

05:04.102 --> 05:08.439
Well, where do you go when
   you say you'll be right back?

05:08.507 --> 05:13.311
I just go and put on
a little perfume.

05:13.379 --> 05:16.447
Gee, I guess nothing's
                 foolproof, huh?

05:16.515 --> 05:19.350
Look, Tony,
it's not for sure.

05:19.418 --> 05:23.788
Oh, you mean, you've had
     false alarms before, right?

05:23.855 --> 05:26.524
No, but there's
      always a first time.

05:26.592 --> 05:30.228
Yeah. Well, you want me to go
          to the doctor with ya?

05:30.296 --> 05:33.831
No.
 You've already done your part.

05:33.899 --> 05:36.601
But I'll call you later
and let you know what happens.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.136
Okay. Good luck.

05:39.204 --> 05:40.238
I'm gonna need it.

05:40.305 --> 05:42.673
Okay, baby.

06:02.194 --> 06:06.231
Hey, Banta,
              you look troubled.

06:06.298 --> 06:07.365
You got a problem?

06:07.432 --> 06:09.434
You ain't kidding, Louie.

06:09.501 --> 06:14.472
Well, look, I'll tell ya
      what always worked for me.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.407
You hit the road.

06:16.475 --> 06:18.709
You get out there
                    and ya drive

06:18.777 --> 06:21.812
and you forget your problems,

06:21.880 --> 06:24.015
and plus, you make
                 a little money.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.383
I mean, it beats

06:25.450 --> 06:26.750
sitting around here
             moping, doesn't it?

06:26.818 --> 06:30.854
I think you're right, Louie.

06:30.922 --> 06:32.123
Yeah, I wanna drive, man.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.157
Give me a cab.

06:33.225 --> 06:34.725
Sorry, all out.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.036
(Elaine laughing)

06:45.104 --> 06:49.907
ELAINE:
Oh, Tony, hi. Hey.

06:49.975 --> 06:52.043
ALEX:
Everything all right?

06:52.110 --> 06:54.945
Don't talk to me.
             I need to be alone.

06:56.848 --> 06:59.884
You just want us
to ignore you?

06:59.952 --> 07:02.553
Okay.

07:02.621 --> 07:04.288
We'll just talk
among ourselves.

07:04.356 --> 07:05.623
We'll pretend
you're not even here.

07:05.691 --> 07:06.924
Okay, guys?
        Sure.

07:06.992 --> 07:10.728
Let's pretend
     Tony's not even here.

07:10.796 --> 07:13.497
Right, Jim.

07:13.565 --> 07:15.666
This will be a blast.

07:15.734 --> 07:19.203
I'm goin' first.

07:21.206 --> 07:25.276
Has anyone ever noticed
         how Tony eats?

07:29.148 --> 07:33.251
He's got the table manners
           of a Hun.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.088
(snickers)

07:39.491 --> 07:42.794
I mean, maybe I'm not
         Mr. Etiquette,

07:42.861 --> 07:46.297
but they should serve his food
          in a trough.

07:52.104 --> 07:53.704
Will you knock it off?

07:53.772 --> 07:57.174
Where did that come from?

08:02.013 --> 08:03.881
It came from me.
                 I'm right here.

08:03.949 --> 08:07.018
You lose!

08:07.086 --> 08:11.355
Okay, now let's pretend
       that I'm not here.

08:11.423 --> 08:13.624
You're <i>not</i> all here, Jim.

08:13.692 --> 08:16.427
Wait, wait, wait.
       Tony, this is ridiculous.

08:16.494 --> 08:18.629
If you came here,
              you obviously want

08:18.697 --> 08:20.098
to talk to someone,

08:20.165 --> 08:22.433
so would it help
          to talk to Alex alone?

08:23.702 --> 08:24.669
To me?

08:24.736 --> 08:26.036
No, Elaine.

08:26.104 --> 08:27.338
To Jim?

08:27.406 --> 08:29.207
I'd rather talk
                to this pretzel.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.044
I know
what's bothering you.

08:34.111 --> 08:35.513
You're worried
about the fight, right?

08:35.580 --> 08:38.249
Tony, Tony,
you're in great shape.

08:38.317 --> 08:39.316
You can't lose.

08:39.384 --> 08:40.818
You're gonna take
                       this guy.

08:40.885 --> 08:43.120
I don't think you have
         a thing to worry about.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.622
Alex, I'm not worried
about the fight.

08:44.689 --> 08:48.325
Well, you better start.
            That guy's a killer.

08:48.393 --> 08:49.860
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

08:49.928 --> 08:51.596
I'm gonna stick around.

08:51.664 --> 08:52.997
I'm payin'
    for the beer.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.999
No, no, no, Jim,
come on.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.166
You always pay.

08:56.234 --> 08:58.135
I mean, just because
you have $3 million dollars

08:58.203 --> 08:59.804
doesn't mean
you always have to pay.

08:59.871 --> 09:01.238
No?

09:01.306 --> 09:04.175
No, of course not.
Let Alex pay.

09:04.243 --> 09:05.910
What?

09:11.016 --> 09:13.284
Not a cent more.

09:13.352 --> 09:14.418
ELAINE/JIM:
                      Hi, Vicki.

09:14.486 --> 09:15.753
Hi, Vick.

09:18.256 --> 09:20.157
Hi, Ton.

09:20.225 --> 09:23.727
Hi, Vicki.
             Oh, here, sit down.

09:26.598 --> 09:28.265
Did you take
                       the test?

09:28.333 --> 09:29.967
Mm-hmm.

09:30.035 --> 09:31.068
What'd the doctor say?

09:31.136 --> 09:33.137
I want a drink.

09:33.205 --> 09:34.405
The guy sounds like a lush.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.207
How's he keep his license?

09:36.274 --> 09:38.609
Tony, I'm saying I want a drink.

09:38.676 --> 09:41.278
Oh. hey, Tommy.
                           Yeah?

09:41.346 --> 09:42.379
One beer, man.

09:42.447 --> 09:44.081
So, what'd he say?

09:44.149 --> 09:46.450
The doctor says
I'm pregnant.

09:46.518 --> 09:48.920
Make that two beers,
                       huh, Tom?

09:48.987 --> 09:53.024
Oh, well, uh, don't worry
     about a thing, Vicki.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.125
I mean, uh, I'm gonna do
      the honorable thing.

09:55.193 --> 09:56.928
I'm gonna marry ya.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.929
I got a weekend
                  off coming up.

09:58.997 --> 10:00.531
You can wear
         my mom's wedding dress.

10:00.598 --> 10:01.732
Tony, wait.

10:01.800 --> 10:02.900
We can't wait, Vic.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.202
I mean, I'll pick up

10:04.269 --> 10:05.503
the marriage licenses
        in the morning.

10:05.570 --> 10:06.937
I think we need blood tests.

10:07.005 --> 10:08.339
Tony, could you stop
         for a minute?

10:08.406 --> 10:09.507
I really don't think
       it's that simple.

10:09.575 --> 10:10.942
I know,
                I know it isn't.

10:11.009 --> 10:15.445
There's bridesmaids, best man,
         the caterer, the music.

10:15.513 --> 10:17.181
My cousin Vito
           could play the organ.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.850
Oh, but if we use him,
        we gotta use his monkey.

10:19.918 --> 10:21.184
Oh, come on, Tony!

10:21.252 --> 10:23.353
Tony, you're being ridiculous!
            Please!

10:23.421 --> 10:25.856
Hey, Vicki, we gotta get
        married, Vicki.

10:25.924 --> 10:27.425
No, we don't have
        to get married.

10:27.492 --> 10:29.560
Yes, we do, Vicki!
         We have to get married!

10:29.628 --> 10:31.095
No, we don't <i>have</i>
to get married.

10:31.162 --> 10:33.264
And we're not going to!

10:33.331 --> 10:36.467
There's no way
I'm gonna marry
a jerk like you...

10:36.535 --> 10:39.736
whether I'm carrying
your baby or not!

10:40.505 --> 10:41.739
Hey, Vicki!

10:51.883 --> 10:53.451
This thing that's
             been bothering you,

10:53.519 --> 10:55.086
you still don't
            wanna talk about it?

10:55.153 --> 10:56.120
No.

10:56.188 --> 10:57.788
Come on, Tony,
                 whatever it is,

10:57.856 --> 10:59.790
you've gotta get it
                  off your mind.

10:59.858 --> 11:01.658
This is
your big chance, Tony.

11:01.726 --> 11:02.927
I mean,
if you win this,

11:02.995 --> 11:05.195
you could be on your way
to a ranking, right?
                        I guess.

11:05.263 --> 11:06.630
I mean, you worked hard
to get here.

11:06.698 --> 11:08.565
You wanna make all that
hard work pay off, right?

11:08.633 --> 11:09.700
I suppose.

11:09.768 --> 11:11.936
You wanna show people out there
        what you can do.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.037
You want people out there
     to remember the night

11:14.105 --> 11:16.240
when Tony Banta came from
  nowhere and beat Dean Gentry

11:16.307 --> 11:17.608
and escalated himself
         into the ranks

11:17.676 --> 11:18.909
of the boxing immortals, right?

11:18.977 --> 11:19.943
That would be nice.

11:20.011 --> 11:21.112
Then you gotta think positive!

11:21.179 --> 11:22.479
You gotta believe
       you're gonna win!

11:22.547 --> 11:23.514
Are you gonna win?!

11:23.581 --> 11:24.582
What?

11:24.649 --> 11:25.649
(faintly):
             Maybe.

11:25.717 --> 11:27.050
Louder!
I can't hear ya!

11:27.118 --> 11:28.653
Maybe.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.087
Maybe?

11:30.155 --> 11:33.457
After all that, I think I can go
  out and beat the guy myself.

11:33.525 --> 11:34.725
(knocking)
            Come in.

11:34.793 --> 11:36.560
Hi.

11:36.628 --> 11:37.628
TONY:
Oh, hi, Elaine.

11:37.696 --> 11:40.063
Tony, I just want you
                   to know that,

11:40.131 --> 11:41.799
even though
            I don't like boxing,

11:41.867 --> 11:44.468
I really do hope
                 it goes as well
              as can be expected

11:44.536 --> 11:46.437
and that it's
                not too terrible

11:46.505 --> 11:49.006
and that you manage to do
         whatever you need to do

11:49.074 --> 11:51.275
to that poor man
       before he does it to you.

11:53.077 --> 11:54.779
Well, thanks, Elaine.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.814
And, uh, if that was
a pep talk,

11:56.882 --> 11:58.583
you did just as good
as Alex.

11:58.650 --> 12:02.520
You know, I really
like your apartment.

12:07.826 --> 12:11.395
It makes my place look
    like a hole in the wall.

12:11.463 --> 12:14.265
Well, we just came here
          to wish you good luck.

12:14.332 --> 12:15.732
See you out there.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.068
Thanks.

12:17.135 --> 12:21.338
Elegant, without
being pretentious.

12:23.942 --> 12:26.377
That's high tech.

12:26.444 --> 12:28.379
Oh, oh, Jim, hey, come on,

12:28.447 --> 12:30.347
I'll show you the
rest of the place.

12:30.415 --> 12:33.083
Okeydoke.

12:33.151 --> 12:34.518
See ya.
            Thanks.

12:34.586 --> 12:35.753
ALEX:
Come on, Tony.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.322
Tony, we got to shock
you out of this.

12:38.389 --> 12:39.890
We got to get your
               adrenaline going.

12:39.958 --> 12:41.425
We've just got
                to get it going.

12:41.493 --> 12:43.794
You know what I'm gonna do?
       I'm gonna slap your face.

12:43.862 --> 12:45.128
Why?
            I've seen that work.

12:45.196 --> 12:46.764
I mean, it stimulates
             you. It shocks you.

12:46.832 --> 12:48.265
It gets you out
                of the doldrums.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.834
It's a... a stupid idea.

12:49.901 --> 12:51.535
I don't know what
              I'm talking about.

12:51.603 --> 12:53.036
Maybe it's a good idea, Alex.

12:53.104 --> 12:54.205
It's worth a shot.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.344
What was that?

13:00.411 --> 13:02.479
If you're gonna
       slap me, slap me.

13:02.547 --> 13:03.648
Okay.

13:03.715 --> 13:05.383
(loud slap)

13:05.450 --> 13:07.084
How's that?
                    Did it work?

13:07.152 --> 13:10.554
No, and I think I got
a loose filling now over here.

13:10.622 --> 13:11.722
Hey, Tony.

13:11.789 --> 13:13.423
Louie, what're
                 you doing here?

13:13.491 --> 13:15.726
I just came to check
    and see how Banta's feeling.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.194
Would you get out of here?

13:17.262 --> 13:20.731
You just came to check and see
     if your bet was still good.

13:20.798 --> 13:23.267
Well, I admit I did
bet against Banta,

13:23.335 --> 13:25.603
but that doesn't mean
    I don't care about him.

13:25.670 --> 13:28.238
Look, Tony,
      I don't know exactly

13:28.306 --> 13:29.773
what it is you're,
     you're going through,

13:29.841 --> 13:33.177
but I know that it's
eating you up inside.

13:33.245 --> 13:36.247
Is there anything that I
     or anybody else can do

13:36.314 --> 13:39.150
to lift you out of this
  depression before the fight?

13:39.218 --> 13:41.084
No, Louie.

13:41.152 --> 13:42.886
Well, I guess I'm gonna
       go double my bet.

13:42.954 --> 13:45.422
Is there a phone in here?

13:45.490 --> 13:47.191
Louie, would you
        get out of here.

13:47.258 --> 13:49.460
No telephone?
           Will you just get out
                of here, please?

13:49.527 --> 13:51.295
You got a dime?
                    No! Get out!

13:53.599 --> 13:54.999
Oh, come on, Tony, Tony.

13:55.066 --> 13:57.868
Now you've always been able to
confide in me and trust in me.

13:57.936 --> 13:58.969
Please, open up.

13:59.037 --> 14:00.504
Alex, it's too personal.

14:05.376 --> 14:07.778
Hey, Tony, looking good.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.179
Hey, Leo, what
                     do you say?

14:09.247 --> 14:10.448
Hey, Alex, this
                 is Leo Goodman.

14:10.515 --> 14:11.448
He's my new manager.

14:11.516 --> 14:12.583
This is Alex Reiger.

14:12.651 --> 14:13.717
He's gonna work
             in our corner, Leo.

14:13.785 --> 14:14.785
Welcome aboard.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.087
Glad to have you
                  in the corner.

14:16.154 --> 14:17.655
Gonna be a hell
             of a fight tonight.

14:17.722 --> 14:19.857
Uh, can I talk to
you for a moment?
                What about?

14:19.925 --> 14:21.858
I hope it's about sports.
        I know all about boxing.

14:21.926 --> 14:22.860
No, it's about Tony.

14:22.927 --> 14:24.628
He's very depressed.

14:24.696 --> 14:25.996
Tony, depressed?

14:27.598 --> 14:28.999
No, he-he looks pensive.

14:29.067 --> 14:31.368
That's what I like--
              a pensive fighter.

14:31.436 --> 14:33.136
It shows he's thinking.

14:33.204 --> 14:34.805
Listen, listen, look, um,

14:34.872 --> 14:36.640
there's, there's
a problem he's got

14:36.707 --> 14:37.741
that's really eating him up

14:37.809 --> 14:40.344
and I know that if I could
find out what it is,

14:40.412 --> 14:41.746
I could really help him.

14:41.813 --> 14:44.848
No, you know, I think that
       you are overly concerned.

14:44.916 --> 14:47.351
You see, judging by
               the looks of him,

14:47.419 --> 14:49.153
it could only be
              one of two things.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.888
Either he's got a girl
     pregnant or he's got piles.

14:53.992 --> 14:57.694
If he's got piles,
            he would've told me.

14:57.762 --> 14:59.329
Who's the girl? Vicki?

14:59.397 --> 15:01.064
Yeah, Leo.

15:01.132 --> 15:05.836
I'm glad we got
           that out in the open.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.170
Feel better now?

15:07.238 --> 15:09.473
Come on, let's get out there
and really get going.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.575
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

15:11.643 --> 15:13.444
You want to go through
with this fight tonight?

15:13.512 --> 15:15.212
What kind of a
               question is that?

15:15.280 --> 15:17.781
All right, so he got
       a girl pregnant. So what?

15:17.849 --> 15:20.551
I mean, it's not as bad
  as having his car repossessed.

15:20.618 --> 15:23.387
Wait. That's a callous
attitude, don't you think?

15:23.454 --> 15:26.090
Well, I know, but
          he's like a son to me.

15:26.157 --> 15:28.292
No, I mean, comparing it
 to having his car repossessed?

15:28.360 --> 15:29.760
Well, it's a
               lousy comparison.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.495
I'm the first one
                  to admit that.

15:31.563 --> 15:32.863
So what'd you say it for?

15:32.931 --> 15:35.099
Well, 'cause it just come
         off the top of my head.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.802
Here the boy's going out
          for the most important
              fight of his life.

15:37.869 --> 15:39.036
What am I supposed to say?

15:39.104 --> 15:41.071
You want me to say,
           "With all the burdens

15:41.139 --> 15:44.308
you got on your shoulders,
      you'll be lucky to make it
       through the first round?"

15:44.375 --> 15:46.443
I mean, what kind
         of a manager would I be

15:46.511 --> 15:51.181
if I said something like
           that in front of him.

15:51.249 --> 15:52.983
You didn't hear
                  that, did you?

15:53.050 --> 15:55.318
Yeah, I heard it.

15:55.386 --> 15:56.454
Oh, so what. Come on.

15:56.521 --> 15:57.788
No, wait a minute.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.323
Tony, Tony, just
tell me something.

15:59.391 --> 16:00.924
How-how is Vicki
taking this?

16:00.992 --> 16:03.227
Oh, she's taking
              it terrible, Alex.
             She won't marry me.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.029
She won't talk to me.
     She won't discuss it.

16:05.096 --> 16:06.764
She won't...
                  Look, hey, you
                   two, you two,

16:06.831 --> 16:08.832
you know you can settle
       this walking to the ring.

16:08.900 --> 16:09.900
It's a 45 second walk.

16:09.967 --> 16:11.068
Wait a minute now.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.803
45 seconds-- we need
      more time than that.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.638
Well, you'll probably
        have more time than that

16:14.706 --> 16:17.274
because I usually get lost.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.445
(bell ringing)

16:21.513 --> 16:23.280
ANNOUNCER:
           <i>Introducing</i>
      <i>in the black corner,</i>

16:23.348 --> 16:27.718
weighing in
     at an even 165 pounds,

16:27.786 --> 16:29.186
fighting out of Boston,

16:29.254 --> 16:32.956
a former Golden Gloves
        boxing champion,

16:33.024 --> 16:35.793
tenth ranked middleweight
          in the world

16:35.860 --> 16:39.696
with 11 knockouts
    in his 15 straight wins,

16:39.764 --> 16:43.767
the pride of Massachusetts,

16:43.835 --> 16:47.671
undefeated
    Dean "Big Bang" Gentry!

16:47.739 --> 16:51.475
(audience cheering)

16:54.446 --> 16:57.147
And over here, Tony Banta!

16:57.215 --> 17:01.352
(crowd cheering)

17:01.420 --> 17:04.855
I insist that all my fighters
   have short introductions.

17:04.923 --> 17:05.955
Why?

17:06.022 --> 17:07.157
'Cause I have to write them.

17:09.727 --> 17:11.060
The referee now will
       give instructions.

17:11.127 --> 17:13.696
Gene Le Bell.

17:13.765 --> 17:15.833
(audience cheering)

17:15.900 --> 17:17.701
Gentlemen, let's have
         a clean fight.

17:17.769 --> 17:20.171
In the event of a knockdown,
    go to a neutral corner.

17:20.238 --> 17:24.240
I want you to shake hands
 and good luck to both of you.

17:24.308 --> 17:26.143
Alex, I don't care
about this fight.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.811
I can't get Vicki
out of my mind.

17:27.878 --> 17:29.146
I don't care
if I win or lose.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.647
What do you mean, you don't
        care if you win or lose?

17:30.715 --> 17:32.282
You better care
             if you win or lose!

17:32.350 --> 17:33.717
There's nothing you can do
          about Vicki right now.

17:33.784 --> 17:35.719
The only thing you can do
       is concentrate on boxing,

17:35.787 --> 17:37.120
this fight, that's all.

17:37.188 --> 17:38.888
This is the most important
             fight of your life.

17:38.956 --> 17:40.924
You know, I don't think I
could've said it as good myself.

17:40.992 --> 17:43.093
And I'd like to add
        one thing to it.

17:43.161 --> 17:45.495
After 53 years
       in the fight game,

17:45.563 --> 17:48.232
I'm retiring after the fight
tonight is finished

17:48.299 --> 17:50.500
and I would like
    to go out with a winner.

17:50.568 --> 17:53.170
Tony, it's up to you.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.540
Oh, but, but, Leo,
I may not win.

17:56.608 --> 17:57.874
Oh, well, I'm just blowing air.

17:57.942 --> 17:59.843
Listen, I'll be managing
         when I'm 100.

17:59.911 --> 18:01.011
(bell ringing)

18:04.015 --> 18:05.215
ALEX:
Listen, Leo,

18:05.283 --> 18:07.117
I've known Tony a long time.

18:07.184 --> 18:08.452
Despite whatever he says,

18:08.520 --> 18:10.154
when he feels
               that first punch,

18:10.221 --> 18:11.255
he's gonna snap out of it.

18:11.322 --> 18:12.589
Oh!

18:12.657 --> 18:14.958
All right, come on!

18:15.026 --> 18:17.961
Three, four, five...

18:18.028 --> 18:19.229
I see what you mean.

18:19.297 --> 18:21.098
He looks better already.

18:25.803 --> 18:27.404
(crowd cheering)

18:27.471 --> 18:29.406
(bell rings)

18:31.676 --> 18:34.144
You keep walking into
    his left hand out there.

18:34.212 --> 18:36.913
It's the fourth round, Alex
  and she's not even here yet.

18:36.981 --> 18:38.982
Well, you said she wasn't
     returning your phone calls.

18:39.050 --> 18:40.617
Yeah, but at least I thought
    she'd come to my fight.

18:40.685 --> 18:42.619
After all, I am
    the father of her child.

18:42.687 --> 18:44.187
Tony, stop
             torturing yourself.

18:44.255 --> 18:45.689
I can't, Alex, I can't help it.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.824
I keep wondering,
    will I ever get married?

18:47.892 --> 18:48.993
Will I ever see my kid?

18:49.060 --> 18:50.594
Tony, look, she's not
            coming to the fight.

18:50.662 --> 18:51.828
So just put it out
                   of your mind.

18:51.896 --> 18:53.897
Hey, are we still talking
          about Vicki?

18:53.965 --> 18:56.033
Yeah!
    But she called.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.868
Didn't I tell you?

18:57.935 --> 19:00.737
She wanted you to get a ticket
 for her for the fight tonight.

19:00.805 --> 19:02.272
Leo!

19:02.340 --> 19:03.907
You know I wanted
        to talk to her!

19:03.975 --> 19:05.142
How come you didn't tell me?

19:05.209 --> 19:06.409
Well, I forgot.

19:06.477 --> 19:07.778
How could you forget?
      This was important.

19:07.846 --> 19:09.112
How do you forget
      something like that?

19:09.180 --> 19:10.914
I was busy.

19:10.982 --> 19:12.516
I was writing your introduction.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.618
Hey, Leo, you know
     what's wrong with you?

19:14.686 --> 19:16.086
You're a crummy manager!

19:16.153 --> 19:17.421
That's what's wrong with you!
         (bell ringing)

19:17.489 --> 19:20.758
(mumbling angrily)

19:20.825 --> 19:23.860
LEO:
Save it for the fight, kid!

19:23.928 --> 19:25.295
He's angry!

19:25.363 --> 19:26.430
And he's angry 'cause

19:26.498 --> 19:28.198
I didn't deliver
Vicki's message.

19:28.266 --> 19:29.833
Hey, watch this.

19:29.901 --> 19:34.437
Tony, Vicki called me 100 times
   and I forgot to tell you!

19:34.505 --> 19:36.640
Go, Tony!

19:36.708 --> 19:39.543
(cheering)

19:43.582 --> 19:45.715
(grunting)

19:46.584 --> 19:48.352
(bell dings)

19:48.420 --> 19:51.321
(bell ringing)

19:51.389 --> 19:53.256
Tony, Tony, great fight.

19:53.324 --> 19:54.291
Great fight!

19:54.359 --> 19:55.659
I think you may have
beaten him on points.

19:55.727 --> 19:56.926
You should have knocked him out

19:56.994 --> 19:58.862
when you had him on the ropes
         in the eighth.

19:58.930 --> 19:59.897
Vicki.

19:59.964 --> 20:00.897
How long you been here?

20:00.965 --> 20:02.232
Since the start of the fight.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.634
Well, how come
    you didn't sit ringside?

20:03.702 --> 20:05.402
Because it's hard watching
the guy you love

20:05.470 --> 20:06.903
being force-fed
his own nose.

20:06.971 --> 20:08.438
What was that word you used?

20:08.506 --> 20:09.640
Nose.

20:09.707 --> 20:11.141
That's the thing
in the middle of your face

20:11.209 --> 20:13.010
he was trying to push
to the back of your head.

20:13.078 --> 20:14.911
No, not nose, you said love.

20:14.979 --> 20:16.346
If you love me,
    why won't you marry me?

20:16.414 --> 20:18.582
Because you didn't
      ask me to marry you.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.317
You told me we had to.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.919
If you'd asked me,
I might have said yes.

20:21.986 --> 20:22.919
All right, I'm asking.

20:22.987 --> 20:24.021
Will you marry me?

20:25.122 --> 20:27.024
That's supposed
       to be a proposal?

20:27.091 --> 20:28.859
In most countries, it is.

20:28.926 --> 20:31.595
No, usually the guy
  tells the girl he loves her.

20:31.663 --> 20:32.796
Okay, fine, I love you.

20:32.864 --> 20:33.997
You satisfied?

20:34.065 --> 20:36.099
Yeah!

20:36.167 --> 20:39.202
All I wanted was
            a little tenderness.

20:39.270 --> 20:41.705
All right, will you
      marry me, yes or no?

20:43.908 --> 20:46.543
Would you ask me to marry you
     if I wasn't pregnant?

20:46.610 --> 20:47.945
Yes.

20:48.012 --> 20:49.913
Would you ask me to marry you

20:49.981 --> 20:51.915
if you hadn't been hit
   in the head for 10 rounds?

20:51.983 --> 20:53.316
Ooh, what's that
               supposed to mean?

20:53.384 --> 20:55.419
You know what that means.
          I'd like to hit you...

20:55.486 --> 20:57.354
Ask her to marry you
               and make it nice.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.421
I already did.

20:58.489 --> 21:00.023
Well, ask her again.

21:00.091 --> 21:03.394
All right.

21:03.461 --> 21:05.428
Would you marry me?

21:11.969 --> 21:13.470
I have to think about it.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.205
Well, I...
                     No, no, no!

21:15.273 --> 21:16.639
(bell ringing)

21:16.707 --> 21:18.308
ANNOUNCER:
     Ladies and gentlemen,

21:18.375 --> 21:22.245
we have a split decision!

21:22.313 --> 21:24.481
Oh, come on, Vicki, marry me.

21:24.548 --> 21:26.884
Judge Harold Lederman
     at ringside scores it

21:26.951 --> 21:32.556
97 to 95 in favor
        of Dean Gentry.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.559
Come on, Vicki, please?

21:35.626 --> 21:38.095
Judge Eric Billson,
       also at ringside,

21:38.163 --> 21:44.168
sees it 95 to 93
    in favor of Tony Banta.

21:44.235 --> 21:45.969
(crowd cheering)

21:46.036 --> 21:48.072
Please, please, please, please?

21:48.139 --> 21:52.075
The deciding ballot cast
    by referee Gene Le Bell,

21:52.143 --> 21:54.911
he scores it 94 to 92

21:54.979 --> 21:58.815
in favor of the winner...

21:58.883 --> 22:01.251
Okay, I'll marry you.

22:01.318 --> 22:02.986
Dean Gentry!

22:03.053 --> 22:06.490
(cheering)

22:06.558 --> 22:09.426
For a minute,
I thought Gentry won.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.461
He did, but Tony's
         a good loser.

22:11.529 --> 22:13.029
Good? He's great!

22:13.097 --> 22:15.198
(laughing)

22:23.540 --> 22:25.508
Good night, fellas.
All right, Leo,
take it easy.

22:25.576 --> 22:28.479
Hey, thanks a lot, Lee.
                Good night, Leo.

22:32.751 --> 22:34.985
Alex,

22:35.052 --> 22:38.455
you think Vicki meant it
  when she said she loves me?

22:38.522 --> 22:40.290
Yeah, I think so, yes.

22:42.159 --> 22:44.661
You think I meant it
    when I said I love her?

22:46.731 --> 22:48.532
Well, I thought so
              at the time, yeah.

22:48.599 --> 22:51.300
Yeah, so did I.

22:51.368 --> 22:53.603
No, I mean, hey,
 what difference does it make?

22:53.671 --> 22:55.171
I mean, I got to marry her.

22:55.239 --> 22:56.773
It's the honorable
                    thing to do.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.810
I mean, who knows,
            maybe I do love her.

23:00.878 --> 23:04.113
Hey, Alex, how do you know?

23:04.181 --> 23:06.016
How do you know
   when the woman comes along

23:06.084 --> 23:08.485
that you want to love
   for the rest of your life?

23:08.552 --> 23:12.389
Well, that's a question
    for a wiser man than I.

23:12.456 --> 23:14.357
Hmm, you're right.

23:14.425 --> 23:17.160
I'll go see if I
            can catch up to Leo.

23:18.496 --> 23:21.865
Leo! Leo! Hey, Leo!

23:21.933 --> 23:23.700
Leo!

23:31.709 --> 23:34.278
(theme song playing)

23:56.034 --> 23:57.500
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:57.568 --> 23:58.569
(man grumbling)
