WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.367
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:02.378 --> 00:03.618
After 6 months in hell,

00:03.695 --> 00:04.995
I have been released from prison

00:05.072 --> 00:06.964
and returned home
with only one goal...

00:07.041 --> 00:08.373
To save my city,

00:08.384 --> 00:09.833
but things have changed.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.626
Instead of operating
outside the law,

00:11.703 --> 00:13.503
I am now working
alongside the police.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.338
I am no longer inmate 4587.

00:16.416 --> 00:20.052
I am once more the green arrow.

00:20.062 --> 00:21.678
Previously on "Arrow"...

00:21.755 --> 00:22.896
Working with the scpd...

00:22.973 --> 00:24.514
That's what's best
for this city.

00:24.591 --> 00:25.869
The whole city will be
watching you,

00:25.893 --> 00:27.601
holding you to
the highest standard.

00:27.677 --> 00:30.395
Dad, please. Don't leave.

00:30.472 --> 00:32.189
Dante took me under his
wing, and he trained me.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.699
I kept holding out, thinking

00:33.776 --> 00:35.411
one day you'd become
the father I deserved.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.286
It's never gonna happen, is it?

00:37.362 --> 00:39.415
Is there something else you'd
like to talk to me about?

00:39.439 --> 00:42.249
No. Have a good trip.

00:42.326 --> 00:45.660
When emiko realizes that Dante
has been manipulating her,

00:45.737 --> 00:49.998
it will drive a wedge between
her and the ninth circle.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.042
Rot in hell.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.919
The ninth circle got away

00:53.995 --> 00:55.148
with a very dangerous
biological weapon...

00:55.172 --> 00:57.973
The cygnus x-1.

01:01.253 --> 01:03.011
I have just received
confirmation

01:03.088 --> 01:06.440
of two fatalities here at the
hudolin mcguire Metro station.

01:06.517 --> 01:08.683
Scpd have cordoned off the area,

01:08.760 --> 01:11.269
but the community is
very concerned.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.897
Rumors are already flying as
to who might be responsible.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.274
- Captain Drake.
- How's it look?

01:16.285 --> 01:19.694
You need to see
this for yourself.

01:19.771 --> 01:22.072
Hey, keep those damn
reporters back.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.462
This is where we found them.

01:28.539 --> 01:30.705
Oh, my god.

01:30.782 --> 01:33.416
We'll have to wait for
the official m.E. Report,

01:33.427 --> 01:35.293
but it seems obvious...

01:35.304 --> 01:37.054
Blunt force trauma.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.463
Looks like they got off
a few rounds

01:38.474 --> 01:40.215
before they went down.

01:40.292 --> 01:41.716
Did they hit anything?

01:41.793 --> 01:43.477
Nothing alive.

01:48.818 --> 01:51.026
Where are the suspects?

01:54.014 --> 01:57.825
We've got two dead guards
and one hell of a mess.

01:57.901 --> 01:59.943
Your team was on-site.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.496
I think you better
start talking.

02:10.655 --> 02:12.673
This is... this whole
thing is ridiculous.

02:12.749 --> 02:15.167
The real danger is
still out there.

02:15.177 --> 02:18.128
I don't think you get to
decide the real danger,

02:18.205 --> 02:20.514
Mr. Queen.

02:20.591 --> 02:22.015
We went to the subway platform

02:22.092 --> 02:23.517
to stop a terrorist attack,

02:23.594 --> 02:24.852
which we did,

02:24.928 --> 02:26.189
but the people
that we were after

02:26.213 --> 02:27.470
are still on the loose.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.472
Well, luckily we have

02:29.549 --> 02:31.433
half the department out there
right now following the same lead.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.029
Do you think that these are
average street thugs, dinah?

02:33.053 --> 02:34.811
These are terrorists
that tried to release

02:34.888 --> 02:36.363
a biological agent in star city.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.023
Thousands of people
could have died.

02:38.033 --> 02:41.243
Two people did die.

02:43.614 --> 02:45.706
We found two emerald arrows
at the scene.

02:45.782 --> 02:48.074
The new green arrow.

02:48.151 --> 02:51.161
Why don't you tell me about her
involvement at the subway tonight?

02:53.240 --> 02:54.873
She was there.

02:54.884 --> 02:58.710
She? How do you know that?

02:58.721 --> 03:01.171
I think it's time we
tell people the truth.

03:01.248 --> 03:04.174
The new green arrow
is my half-sister.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.800
Her name is emiko adachi.

03:05.877 --> 03:07.385
She belongs to
a terrorist organization

03:07.396 --> 03:09.346
called the ninth circle.

03:09.422 --> 03:10.555
The vigilantes have been
tracking her

03:10.566 --> 03:11.848
for a few weeks now.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.726
Why didn't you inform the scpd?

03:14.737 --> 03:16.403
Because the ninth circle is

03:16.480 --> 03:19.022
just a little bit beyond
the scpd, officer.

03:19.099 --> 03:22.025
The scpd-vigilante
partnership works best

03:22.102 --> 03:23.735
when we operate as
a covert unit.

03:23.746 --> 03:25.987
Doesn't seem so in this case.

03:26.064 --> 03:28.406
Well, I'm usually kept
aware of what's going on,

03:28.417 --> 03:30.992
but I did not know about this.

03:31.069 --> 03:32.586
Care to explain why?

03:35.666 --> 03:37.249
Things started moving
pretty quickly

03:37.259 --> 03:39.301
after you told us about Dante.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.838
Oh, thank god.

03:43.915 --> 03:45.840
Please tell me the news
that you are bringing

03:45.917 --> 03:48.009
is about emiko and her
ninth circle buddies

03:48.086 --> 03:49.511
because I have had no luck

03:49.587 --> 03:50.657
with my typity-type
finding anything thing.

03:50.681 --> 03:51.930
Oh, well, you're in luck now.

03:51.941 --> 03:53.598
Dante, not so much.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.943
A couple scpd beat cops
found his body this morning.

03:56.019 --> 03:57.852
Let me guess, and not
from natural causes.

03:57.929 --> 03:59.521
Not unless you call 3 arrows

03:59.597 --> 04:01.523
and a knife
to the chest natural.

04:01.599 --> 04:02.743
This was after you told emiko
that Dante killed her mother.

04:02.767 --> 04:04.276
Can't be a coincidence.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.786
No. She went ahead and killed

04:05.862 --> 04:07.362
the only father
figure she had left.

04:07.439 --> 04:09.114
Right. So that's a "no"

04:09.124 --> 04:10.677
on the evil sister
redeeming herself then.

04:10.701 --> 04:12.459
Ok, so we have
to stop emiko from using

04:12.536 --> 04:14.369
this bio-weapon that she
stole from the d.I.A.

04:14.446 --> 04:15.756
The terrifying bacteria that
eats through everything?

04:15.780 --> 04:17.789
Yeah, let's keep that contained.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.593
Ok, so the bad news is that
I haven't been able to find

04:19.617 --> 04:21.293
the bio-weapon,
but the good news is

04:21.303 --> 04:23.378
that the ninth circle
won't be able to either

04:23.455 --> 04:24.857
unless they get a dissemination
device, a.K.A. A thermal fogger.

04:24.881 --> 04:26.548
And, yes, I checked.

04:26.624 --> 04:27.860
The only place to get one
is aerodyne initiatives.

04:27.884 --> 04:29.217
Digg, let's get there

04:29.294 --> 04:30.593
- and help them protect it.
- Ok.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.304
I'll follow up
with the detective,

04:32.314 --> 04:33.533
see if I can get some more
clues off Dante's body.

04:33.557 --> 04:34.648
Ok.

04:34.725 --> 04:36.057
And I'll hang back with Felicity

04:36.134 --> 04:37.309
and help her with
the typey-type.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.319
- That's ok.
- Moral support.

04:39.396 --> 04:40.696
Ok.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.151
Mr. Queen, Mr. Diggle,

04:46.161 --> 04:47.652
it's a pleasure to finally meet

04:47.663 --> 04:49.279
the famous green arrow
and spartan.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.573
I always believed in
vigilantes in the city.

04:51.649 --> 04:53.166
Well, love to hear it.

04:53.243 --> 04:55.054
Wish we were meeting under
better circumstances.

04:55.078 --> 04:56.911
We have reason to believe

04:56.988 --> 04:58.496
that an asset of yours
has been targeted

04:58.507 --> 05:00.507
by an international
terrorist threat.

05:00.584 --> 05:02.250
Well, that's quite
an accusation,

05:02.261 --> 05:03.896
but I can assure you our
security's top of the line.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.462
With all due respect,

05:05.538 --> 05:07.018
this organization is
far more powerful

05:07.090 --> 05:08.298
than any private company

05:08.375 --> 05:09.683
could possibly contend with.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.593
And with all due respect to you,

05:11.669 --> 05:14.023
we hired over a dozen of the
world's best hackers and thieves

05:14.047 --> 05:15.638
to try to break into
our facility.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.190
None made it past
the front entrance.

05:17.267 --> 05:20.527
Uh, Mr. Toth,

05:20.604 --> 05:22.937
we're simply offering
to help you.

05:23.014 --> 05:24.647
What possible reason
could you have

05:24.724 --> 05:26.316
for turning us down?

05:26.393 --> 05:28.985
Well, I appreciate your concern,

05:29.062 --> 05:31.288
but we've got this covered.

05:39.364 --> 05:42.832
It seems odd that
he turned you down.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.209
We agreed,

05:44.219 --> 05:45.627
so we had Felicity
do a deep dive

05:45.703 --> 05:47.545
into toth's financial records.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.547
Turns out he was getting

05:49.558 --> 05:51.558
some very large deposits.

05:51.635 --> 05:53.885
So he was on the take...

05:53.962 --> 05:55.804
- From the ninth circle.
- Mm-hmm.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.181
And why the hell
didn't you tell me?

05:58.258 --> 05:59.557
Because we couldn't confirm it

05:59.568 --> 06:00.975
until later, dinah.

06:01.052 --> 06:02.569
Well, I want to believe
you, Oliver,

06:02.646 --> 06:04.407
but you've got to admit,
this looks really bad.

06:04.431 --> 06:08.316
I mean, we got arrows
at the crime scene.

06:08.393 --> 06:11.361
We've got a very
incriminating distress call

06:11.438 --> 06:14.072
from one of the victims,
and you were there.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.032
Not to mention the
missing security footage.

06:16.109 --> 06:20.578
Ok. Dinah,
you know me, all right?

06:20.589 --> 06:24.591
You know that I didn't
kill those people.

06:24.668 --> 06:26.593
You've killed before...

06:26.670 --> 06:29.170
Huh...

06:29.247 --> 06:31.214
Many times.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.766
Five months ago,
you were sitting

06:32.843 --> 06:34.259
in a cell in slabside.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.061
You're not exactly innocent.

06:36.138 --> 06:37.887
Enjoying yourself?
You having a good time?

06:37.964 --> 06:39.597
You have had it out for me

06:39.608 --> 06:43.435
since the moment that
I was deputized by the scpd.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.779
You know, those guards were
not just killed, Oliver.

06:45.856 --> 06:49.065
They were savagely
beaten to death.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.401
Do you understand how bad
this looks for the department?

06:51.478 --> 06:55.163
Yes, I do, but I didn't do it.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.073
- Then who did?
- I don't know.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.491
So it could have been

06:58.568 --> 06:59.753
one of the members of your team.

06:59.777 --> 07:02.412
My team...

07:02.489 --> 07:04.247
Stopped a terrorist attack.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.352
Except it wasn't just your
team who was there, was it?

07:06.376 --> 07:08.251
There was somebody else there,

07:08.328 --> 07:09.961
somebody besides Mr. Diggle

07:09.972 --> 07:12.139
and Ms. Smoak and Mr. Ramirez.

07:15.335 --> 07:16.801
Yes, there was.

07:16.812 --> 07:18.636
We thought the ninth circle

07:18.647 --> 07:21.431
was gonna wipe out star city.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.942
So I made a call.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.276
You do understand what accomplice
to murder means, right?

07:33.353 --> 07:34.986
You can't be serious.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.071
Tonight's security footage

07:37.148 --> 07:40.074
from hudolin mcguire subway
station mysteriously disappeared.

07:40.151 --> 07:42.129
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

07:42.153 --> 07:45.330
Nope. Nothing, zilch, nada.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.507
She's covering for her husband.

07:47.584 --> 07:50.010
- Oh, come...
- That certainly is convenient.

07:50.086 --> 07:51.397
And when exactly were you
planning on telling me

07:51.421 --> 07:53.588
about Roy Harper's involvement?

07:53.665 --> 07:55.256
Honestly?

07:55.333 --> 07:57.684
After we saved star city from
the ninth circle's attack.

07:57.761 --> 07:59.853
We know how you guys feel
about "the unsanctioned."

07:59.930 --> 08:01.679
Let's get real.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.857
Emiko and the ninth circle
know our faces.

08:03.934 --> 08:05.642
Roy was our Ace in the hole.

08:05.718 --> 08:08.645
So you risked your new
relationship with the scpd

08:08.721 --> 08:10.480
by teaming up with a criminal.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.106
Former criminal.

08:12.183 --> 08:13.775
Roy left the city 4 years ago,

08:13.851 --> 08:15.360
and he's been on the straight
and narrow ever since.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.370
Are you sure about that?

08:16.437 --> 08:17.704
Yes, I'm sure about that.

08:17.781 --> 08:19.280
Because we traced
Harper's whereabouts

08:19.357 --> 08:20.782
after he faked his
death in prison

08:20.858 --> 08:22.375
to get Oliver queen
off the hook,

08:22.452 --> 08:24.661
and his trail went cold
in march of last year.

08:24.737 --> 08:27.121
Oh. You mean when
Ricardo Diaz kidnapped Roy

08:27.198 --> 08:28.665
to turn him against Oliver?

08:28.741 --> 08:30.550
You might have forgotten
about that since you

08:30.627 --> 08:32.710
weren't exactly on speaking terms
with Oliver and I at the time.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.504
It still doesn't explain

08:34.581 --> 08:36.965
where he went after
getting freed from Diaz.

08:37.041 --> 08:39.299
I'm sure the kidnapping
was extremely traumatic.

08:39.376 --> 08:41.344
He probably just went
to go get some r&r...

08:41.421 --> 08:45.223
Some Roy relaxation.

08:45.234 --> 08:49.519
Not funny. I see that now.

08:49.596 --> 08:52.564
Oh. So this is what
legit looks like.

08:52.574 --> 08:56.317
That's right.
A badge and a bunker.

08:56.394 --> 08:57.819
Never thought I'd see the day.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.279
Good seeing you.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.031
I'm glad you're finally
seeing it in person again.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.491
- Ooh!
- Oh!

09:03.568 --> 09:06.586
Oh, I missed you so much.

09:06.663 --> 09:08.913
Sorry. I'm just a little
overly emotional these days.

09:08.990 --> 09:10.415
I mean, not overly emotional,

09:10.491 --> 09:11.916
not, like, heightened
or anything.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.209
Because why would that be?

09:13.286 --> 09:14.586
My hormones
are totally in check,

09:14.662 --> 09:16.129
like they always have been.

09:16.205 --> 09:18.339
Nerves of steel.
You know me. I'm cool.

09:18.416 --> 09:19.716
Ok.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.270
The arsenal. Nice
to finally meet you.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.936
You, too. Thanks
for keeping watch.

09:23.013 --> 09:25.438
The glades can use as
many heroes as it can get.

09:25.515 --> 09:26.606
Welcome back.

09:26.683 --> 09:27.607
All right.

09:27.684 --> 09:29.434
How's thea?

09:29.444 --> 09:31.987
She's good. Yeah, I think she's
finally found her passion.

09:32.063 --> 09:34.447
You'd be really proud of her.

09:34.524 --> 09:36.449
Last I spoke with her, she says

09:36.526 --> 09:38.170
you were zeroing in on
the remaining Lazarus pits.

09:38.194 --> 09:40.153
Yeah, we found two already,

09:40.163 --> 09:41.779
- which we destroyed.
- Mm-hmm.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.459
We were checking the rest
when we got your call.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.408
Speaking of which, why'd
you ask me to come here

09:45.485 --> 09:47.118
instead of thea?

09:47.129 --> 09:52.966
Star city's new terrorist
is Oliver's new sister.

09:53.043 --> 09:54.542
What?

09:54.619 --> 09:55.960
Yeah.

09:56.037 --> 09:57.962
Don't you think thea
would want to know that?

09:57.973 --> 09:59.422
- Yeah.
- Yes.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.726
And I have every intention
of telling her.

10:00.750 --> 10:04.260
I just... this woman's
name is emiko,

10:04.337 --> 10:07.096
and we wanted to get her into
custody before we told her.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.974
I feel like she's finally
free of her life in star city,

10:09.985 --> 10:12.310
and I... I don't want
to hurt her again

10:12.321 --> 10:14.437
with a wound inflicted
on our family

10:14.514 --> 10:16.698
by our father.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.496
Felicity, voice-over:
Roy had been traveling the world

10:20.520 --> 10:22.612
doing some extremely normal
sightseeing.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.291
Apparently he was too busy
to even send a postcard.

10:24.315 --> 10:25.740
Then why did you call him in?

10:25.817 --> 10:27.334
Because of the thermal fogger.

10:27.410 --> 10:29.002
The what?

10:29.079 --> 10:31.079
The scary bio-weapon that
the bad guys needed

10:31.155 --> 10:33.456
to spread the bacteria through
the subway's hvac system.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.625
The device found on the scene.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.627
The device found
at the scene, yes.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.295
Look,

10:39.372 --> 10:41.464
we thought it was weird
that the ceo of aerodyne

10:41.541 --> 10:43.310
wasn't going to let us protect
it from the ninth circle,

10:43.334 --> 10:45.468
so we did some digging.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.637
And found that Jason toth
was dirty. Oliver told us.

10:47.714 --> 10:50.076
We knew good old Jason would be
looking for members of the tga,

10:50.100 --> 10:52.319
and we needed someone with a
vigilante-like set of skills.

10:52.343 --> 10:53.976
Voila. Roy Harper.

10:54.053 --> 10:56.854
The facilities at
aerodyne are no joke,

10:56.865 --> 10:59.741
and Roy is incredible
at parkour.

11:01.945 --> 11:04.195
I'm in.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.530
Remember, Roy,
the floor is armed.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.207
If you touch anything...

11:07.283 --> 11:08.877
And I mean anything... it
is party time at aerodyne,

11:08.901 --> 11:10.493
and not in a good way.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.786
Is there anything I can touch?

11:11.863 --> 11:13.287
Walls and ceilings
are fair game.

11:13.364 --> 11:15.840
Anything that's not the floor.

11:21.372 --> 11:22.964
So far, so good.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.966
The control panel's on
the other side of the fan.

11:25.042 --> 11:27.394
I got to get higher.

11:36.137 --> 11:38.196
I see it.

11:40.984 --> 11:43.735
You hit metal, it's over.
Shot has to be perfect.

11:43.745 --> 11:46.696
Margin of error... 0.08,
but who's counting?

11:46.773 --> 11:48.248
Your target is the red button...

11:48.324 --> 11:49.532
Second from the left.

11:49.609 --> 11:52.085
I don't have a shot...

11:53.780 --> 11:55.714
But I will.

12:04.674 --> 12:06.716
Felicity, voice-over:
Just like that, piece of cake.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.551
Oh, which actually sounds
so good right now.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.887
Do you guys have
any cake or cupcakes

12:10.963 --> 12:12.399
or anything with, like,
a cake-like...

12:12.423 --> 12:14.724
Felicity, tell us
what happened, please.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.361
Roy squeezed his way
through the blades,

12:16.427 --> 12:18.019
and then after that, it was easy

12:18.095 --> 12:21.397
to make his way into
the R&D vault. Boom.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.942
Heads up. We're
late to the party.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.694
That was our only way in.

12:26.771 --> 12:28.362
Not the only way.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.740
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Toth.

12:30.817 --> 12:34.711
Oh, your new sister... not a fan.

12:44.339 --> 12:47.474
Take care of him. Move! Move!

13:04.993 --> 13:06.692
Who the hell are you?

13:06.703 --> 13:08.152
Your new worst nightmare.

13:08.163 --> 13:09.662
Hmm.

13:14.277 --> 13:17.337
See youse lads.

13:18.447 --> 13:19.580
Roy?

13:19.657 --> 13:22.425
We lost the bio-weapon.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.628
So let me get this straight.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.255
If your plan had worked,

13:27.331 --> 13:29.006
Roy would have
successfully stolen

13:29.017 --> 13:31.634
a very dangerous piece of tech.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.520
In other words, committed
a felony.

13:33.596 --> 13:35.522
Well, technically,

13:35.598 --> 13:37.576
Roy was there to stop the ninth
circle from doing what they did,

13:37.600 --> 13:39.578
which was steal the device, so
technically, Roy didn't do anything.

13:39.602 --> 13:41.811
No harm, no foul.
Could I maybe get a pizza?

13:41.888 --> 13:43.696
Just a personal size is fine.

13:43.773 --> 13:45.993
No. I think you've abused your
food privileges enough for today.

13:46.017 --> 13:48.150
- Ok.
- Tell me what happened.

13:48.227 --> 13:49.872
We stopped the ninth circle
from terrorizing the city.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.153
End-stop.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.914
And the two fatalities.

13:54.450 --> 13:56.209
That wasn't our fault.

13:56.286 --> 13:58.628
Then tell me what you know.

14:00.197 --> 14:01.497
We knew that the ninth circle

14:01.574 --> 14:03.291
wanted to maximize
the bio-weapon's impact.

14:03.367 --> 14:05.626
There were two possible
locations to do that...

14:05.703 --> 14:07.837
The ventilation room
and the ventilation shaft.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.223
Oliver went to one, John
and Rene went to the other.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.100
Roy and I went
to the switch room.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.807
Oh, wow! This thing is a fossil,

14:19.884 --> 14:21.684
and not in a fun ice age way.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.236
Can you shut it down?

14:23.313 --> 14:25.521
Well, once I shut down
the ventilation path,

14:25.598 --> 14:29.066
we should be able
to minimize the damage.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.985
Dinah, voice-over: Did
you have any indication

14:31.062 --> 14:32.579
those guards were still on-site?

14:32.655 --> 14:35.707
No. I didn't see those
guards or any guards.

14:40.747 --> 14:44.081
Sounds like we're
not alone. You got eyes?

14:44.158 --> 14:46.259
All I got is two transit
guards in the corridor.

14:46.336 --> 14:48.055
If they're ninth circle,
you can't let them in here.

14:48.079 --> 14:49.837
Well, I can't just
leave you here.

14:49.914 --> 14:52.307
I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Go.

14:59.015 --> 15:02.099
I stayed in that room until
Oliver gave me the go-ahead.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.276
And what about Roy?

15:03.353 --> 15:04.685
What do you mean?

15:04.762 --> 15:06.103
Can you account for
his whereabouts

15:06.114 --> 15:07.447
between the time he left you

15:07.523 --> 15:09.001
and the time those
guards were killed?

15:09.025 --> 15:10.566
Guys, the vents are shut down.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.203
Please tell me that
you have the device.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.281
He was keeping me safe.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.699
That wasn't the question.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.952
Felicity, do you know
where Roy was

15:21.028 --> 15:22.629
when those guards were killed?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.508
No, I don't.

15:32.974 --> 15:36.759
Roy Harper, you are
a hard man to track down.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.260
I've been traveling.

15:38.337 --> 15:41.931
So we've heard.
Whereabouts exactly?

15:42.008 --> 15:43.599
The world.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.143
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.771
You've got quite
the rap sheet, Mr. Harper.

15:48.848 --> 15:53.484
B&e, Grand Theft Auto...

15:53.495 --> 15:55.152
Aggravated assault.

15:55.163 --> 15:58.322
So is that why you came
back to star city, Roy,

15:58.333 --> 16:00.074
to steal a device from aerodyne?

16:00.151 --> 16:02.576
I came back to help prevent
emiko from stealing it.

16:02.653 --> 16:04.829
She's the one you guys
should be going after.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.339
We will.

16:06.416 --> 16:09.166
But first, why don't you
tell us what happened

16:09.177 --> 16:12.586
after you failed to stop her?

16:12.663 --> 16:16.173
I went back to the bunker
to figure out a new plan.

16:16.184 --> 16:19.018
According to Felicity,
all emiko had to do was

16:19.095 --> 16:21.012
fill that device with some
sort of killer bacteria

16:21.022 --> 16:23.806
and star city would've turned
into a real-life horror movie.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.191
Cygnus x-1.

16:25.268 --> 16:29.186
Yeah. So she ran some
sort of algorithm

16:29.197 --> 16:31.147
and came up with a few
possible places.

16:31.223 --> 16:33.607
And that eventually
led you to the subway.

16:33.684 --> 16:35.609
Cut to the chase.

16:35.686 --> 16:37.870
What happened when
you got there?

16:37.947 --> 16:41.115
Specifically, what happened
after you left Felicity?

16:41.192 --> 16:45.545
I didn't want to leave her,
but she insisted.

16:45.621 --> 16:47.541
We thought the ninth circle
might have showed up.

16:49.700 --> 16:52.552
Roy, voice-over:
Turns out we were right.

16:52.628 --> 16:55.755
Those guys in the hoods
jumped me.

16:55.831 --> 16:58.725
After I took out
the first one, they just...

16:58.801 --> 17:00.810
Just kept coming.

17:17.819 --> 17:21.329
I tried to fight back, but there
were just too many of them.

17:25.736 --> 17:28.037
The last thing I remember is

17:28.114 --> 17:30.039
I was taking a mace to the face

17:30.116 --> 17:31.758
before everything went black.

17:31.834 --> 17:34.251
And when I came to,

17:34.262 --> 17:36.253
you all were on the scene,

17:36.264 --> 17:39.048
and the guards, they
were already dead.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.883
So you have absolutely no idea

17:40.960 --> 17:42.560
who may have killed them.

17:47.183 --> 17:50.684
It's rather convenient,
don't you think?

17:50.761 --> 17:52.269
You being unconscious at
the same time

17:52.280 --> 17:55.064
two men are brutally murdered?

17:55.141 --> 17:57.992
You think I did it?

17:59.454 --> 18:01.278
Whose side are you on?

18:01.289 --> 18:05.032
I am on the only side
that matters... the truth.

18:05.109 --> 18:07.409
Now, why don't you
stop wasting my time

18:07.486 --> 18:10.121
and tell me
what really happened?

18:10.131 --> 18:13.082
I told you, Roy was
unconscious when I found him,

18:13.159 --> 18:15.793
and that was before the
guards fired their sidearms.

18:15.804 --> 18:18.087
So you don't think
he killed them.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.589
I just don't see
how he could have.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.975
You don't have to
protect him, John.

18:23.052 --> 18:25.177
Dinah, I'm not.

18:25.254 --> 18:26.896
Right, right.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.815
But that is what
you do, isn't it?

18:28.891 --> 18:32.643
You always put other people's
lives before your own.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.145
At some point you might discover

18:34.155 --> 18:36.480
not everybody's worth it.

18:36.491 --> 18:40.109
Look, you don't know
Roy Harper the way I do.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.328
He's had his troubles.

18:42.405 --> 18:44.989
But deep inside, he's
a very good man.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.116
Well, you're very quick
to defend Roy.

18:47.193 --> 18:48.742
What about yourself?

18:48.819 --> 18:50.327
Why? Are you asking me
if I killed those guards?

18:50.338 --> 18:52.121
It certainly doesn't help

18:52.198 --> 18:54.841
that you have blood
on your sleeve.

18:56.493 --> 18:57.844
Walk us through what happened

18:57.920 --> 19:00.337
after you arrived.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.757
Well, there were two
possible disbursement sites.

19:03.834 --> 19:06.969
Oliver headed for
the ventilation room.

19:07.046 --> 19:11.140
And Rene and I headed
for the ventilation shaft.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.317
And that's when we
ran into trouble.

19:15.155 --> 19:20.032
Access should be here,
ahead on the right.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.323
Emiko.

19:27.399 --> 19:28.991
- I've got her.
- Rene!

19:29.002 --> 19:31.043
She's mine.
Go secure the device.

19:34.382 --> 19:37.124
So that's when you
and Rene split up.

19:37.201 --> 19:40.553
Rene was right.
The device was the priority.

19:40.630 --> 19:42.213
I was headed for
the ventilation shaft,

19:42.223 --> 19:46.800
and that's when I found
Roy unconscious.

19:46.877 --> 19:49.803
And this was before
the gunshots.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.273
That's correct.

20:05.321 --> 20:07.738
John, voice-over:
I ran toward the source

20:07.749 --> 20:11.125
as fast as I could,
but I was too late.

20:13.496 --> 20:15.037
I checked their pulse,

20:15.048 --> 20:16.589
but they were already dead.

20:16.666 --> 20:19.208
That's how I got blood
on my sleeve.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.418
What about Mr. Ramirez?

20:21.429 --> 20:23.420
Where was he during all of this?

20:26.125 --> 20:27.516
John?

20:29.771 --> 20:32.521
John, tell us what you saw.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.944
When I got to the bodies...

20:40.523 --> 20:42.740
That's when I found Rene.

20:46.362 --> 20:47.912
Rene?

20:59.491 --> 21:00.771
What happened
to your hand, Rene?

21:00.826 --> 21:01.826
I cut it.

21:01.877 --> 21:04.086
Well, that's obvious.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.974
Was it around the same time
you lost your glove?

21:05.998 --> 21:07.640
What are you getting at, d.?

21:07.717 --> 21:10.259
You know, I've seen plenty
of perps change their tune

21:10.336 --> 21:12.645
the longer they sit in here.

21:12.722 --> 21:14.596
The truth has a way
of coming out.

21:14.673 --> 21:15.982
This isn't my first time

21:16.058 --> 21:18.150
being falsely accused
of a crime...

21:18.227 --> 21:20.319
Sir.

21:20.396 --> 21:22.479
Two men are dead, Rene.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.156
Now, we know team arrow
was on-site

21:24.233 --> 21:27.443
as well as emiko, which
means our two main suspects

21:27.519 --> 21:29.829
are either her or...

21:29.905 --> 21:31.155
Me?

21:31.165 --> 21:33.198
I didn't say that.

21:33.275 --> 21:34.616
Well, that's what you
were thinking,

21:34.627 --> 21:36.618
'cause you've been
looking for any excuse

21:36.695 --> 21:38.120
not to trust me this whole year.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.913
That's because you have given me

21:39.990 --> 21:42.124
every reason not to.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.251
How many times have I
warned you about emiko?

21:44.328 --> 21:45.845
I told you she wasn't
trustworthy.

21:45.921 --> 21:47.296
You refused to listen.

21:47.373 --> 21:49.298
Well, now she ends up

21:49.309 --> 21:51.300
on the scene of an
attempted terrorist attack

21:51.377 --> 21:53.677
and a double homicide,
and you were there, too.

21:53.688 --> 21:56.472
And you what? You
think I helped her?

21:56.548 --> 21:58.190
I just want the truth, Rene.

21:58.267 --> 22:00.601
Tell me what you were doing
before that mission tonight.

22:00.677 --> 22:02.061
We managed to get the info

22:02.071 --> 22:03.520
on the ninth circle's target

22:03.531 --> 22:05.314
thanks to Felicity's algorithm.

22:05.391 --> 22:08.025
She traced the chemical
signature of the bio-weapon

22:08.036 --> 22:09.443
to the subway station.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.704
And that's when you headed off.

22:11.781 --> 22:13.748
Yeah. Straight away.

22:16.786 --> 22:19.545
You good with all this?

22:19.622 --> 22:22.715
I'll be better once we get
to the subway and stop her.

22:22.792 --> 22:25.501
I know that it's going to be
tough going up against emiko.

22:25.577 --> 22:28.387
You guys got really close, Rene.

22:28.464 --> 22:31.173
If you're gonna try and give me
a pep talk, save it. I'm good.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.059
I don't want to give you
a pep talk.

22:33.135 --> 22:34.729
I want to make sure that if
you're going out on a mission,

22:34.753 --> 22:37.063
you're doing it
with a clear head.

22:42.261 --> 22:44.561
When I first met emiko,

22:44.572 --> 22:46.739
avenging her mother's death

22:46.816 --> 22:49.650
and helping the glades were the
only things that mattered to her.

22:49.726 --> 22:51.652
Right, except she was lying.

22:51.728 --> 22:53.237
Then why did she kill Dante?

22:53.247 --> 22:54.988
Why'd she do it?

22:55.065 --> 22:57.366
I mean, she turned on
a member of the ninth circle

22:57.443 --> 22:58.992
for her mother.

22:59.069 --> 23:00.639
That tells me that family
means more to her.

23:00.663 --> 23:03.756
Fine. It doesn't change
the fact that she

23:03.833 --> 23:08.168
could potentially kill
thousands... thousands of people.

23:08.245 --> 23:12.423
I know, I know, but she's
still your sister, man.

23:12.433 --> 23:15.592
Doesn't any part of you think
that maybe she's doing all of this

23:15.603 --> 23:18.220
because of what your
father did to her,

23:18.297 --> 23:20.097
that if not for her upbringing,

23:20.108 --> 23:22.891
she'd be fighting with us
instead of against us?

23:22.968 --> 23:26.019
A big part of me
thinks about that...

23:26.096 --> 23:27.613
All the time.

23:27.690 --> 23:30.282
At a certain point, Rene,

23:30.359 --> 23:32.284
people need to take
responsibility

23:32.361 --> 23:34.120
for their actions.

23:36.457 --> 23:40.709
Emiko made her choice.
I've made mine.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.505
You need to make yours.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.631
There's something I'm not
liking about your story, Rene.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.475
The part where we save the city?

23:56.552 --> 23:58.260
The part you're not telling us.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.095
Everything I told you
tonight is the truth.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.889
Then why did we find
your fingerprints

24:01.965 --> 24:03.482
on the murder weapon.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.019
What were you doing
with that pipe, Rene?

24:07.029 --> 24:08.604
I didn't do anything.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.400
That's getting harder
and harder to believe.

24:10.474 --> 24:13.317
John and I split up.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.068
He went after the bomb.

24:15.145 --> 24:16.778
I went after emiko.

24:16.855 --> 24:19.448
And did you catch up to her?

24:19.459 --> 24:20.749
No.

24:27.366 --> 24:30.250
Emiko, it's not too late.

24:30.327 --> 24:31.844
Let me help you.

24:31.921 --> 24:34.755
I don't need your help.
I spared you once.

24:34.831 --> 24:36.849
This time, I won't
be so generous.

24:36.926 --> 24:38.425
Why are you doing this?!

24:38.502 --> 24:41.136
Because the queens took
everything from me.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.856
Now it's my turn to
take everything from them.

24:46.802 --> 24:48.360
This isn't you.

24:48.437 --> 24:50.521
You care about the glades.

24:50.531 --> 24:52.481
You're dressed as
the new green arrow,

24:52.558 --> 24:54.149
and you killed Dante.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.035
And that proves what exactly?

24:56.111 --> 24:57.778
That finding your
mother's killer means

24:57.854 --> 24:59.947
more to you
than the ninth circle.

25:00.023 --> 25:02.074
Why else would you risk
murdering their leader?

25:02.150 --> 25:06.328
You really don't get it.
Dante wasn't their leader.

25:06.405 --> 25:08.130
I am.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.428
Your mother would hate
what you've become.

25:15.923 --> 25:17.247
Agh!

25:20.061 --> 25:21.718
Rene, voice-over: I was still
searching for emiko

25:21.729 --> 25:22.937
when I heard the gunshots.

25:25.474 --> 25:27.107
Where were you exactly?

25:27.184 --> 25:28.725
Some random corridor.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.402
The gunshots were close.

25:30.479 --> 25:32.229
I followed the sound, which
led me to the platform.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.147
You know we have a witness

25:34.224 --> 25:36.858
who pins you as the first
person on the scene.

25:36.935 --> 25:38.735
Yeah. John. He showed up...

25:38.746 --> 25:41.205
He showed up seconds
after I did.

25:43.609 --> 25:46.335
What are you not
telling us, Rene?

25:48.614 --> 25:51.257
Someone else got to
the platform before I did.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.479
And who was it?

26:07.016 --> 26:08.857
It was Oliver.

26:14.023 --> 26:16.198
Bring back Mr. Queen.

26:20.937 --> 26:22.571
You didn't tell us the truth.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.616
What are you talking about?

26:25.626 --> 26:27.784
Your friend Ramirez says he
found you near the bodies.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.120
I have no more ways to tell you

26:30.131 --> 26:31.788
I didn't kill those guards.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.132
Let me tell you what I think.

26:33.208 --> 26:34.916
I think you and your team
were there

26:34.993 --> 26:36.418
to stop the terrorist attack.

26:36.495 --> 26:38.587
I even think you did.

26:38.664 --> 26:41.423
But one of the bad guys got
away; You went after them;

26:41.434 --> 26:43.133
and transit guards
Rosenberg and Kim

26:43.144 --> 26:44.468
got in your way.

26:44.478 --> 26:48.314
I didn't kill those guards.

26:48.390 --> 26:50.057
Ok, then who did, Oliver?

26:50.133 --> 26:52.225
Because I really
want to help you,

26:52.302 --> 26:53.780
but I can't do that unless
you're honest with us.

26:53.804 --> 26:55.646
So let's try this again.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.042
Tell me what went on in
that subway,

26:57.066 --> 26:58.657
and I want the truth this time.

27:10.079 --> 27:11.620
Oliver, voice-over:
After we separated,

27:11.697 --> 27:14.414
I went to the ventilation room.

27:14.491 --> 27:17.593
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.336
Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful.

27:19.347 --> 27:22.222
One wrong move, and we'll
all be in a load of trouble.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.679
Aah!

27:28.689 --> 27:32.265
You're a real pain in
the arse, you know that?

28:16.979 --> 28:19.020
That's not the part
we're interested in.

28:19.097 --> 28:20.366
We appreciate you
disarming the device,

28:20.390 --> 28:22.315
but that's not why you're here.

28:22.392 --> 28:24.317
The device is a weapon

28:24.394 --> 28:26.078
that was gonna kill
thousands of people,

28:26.155 --> 28:28.572
and now it's in scpd custody,

28:28.582 --> 28:30.290
thanks to us.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.535
What happened next?

28:34.946 --> 28:37.330
I was still in
the ventilation room

28:37.407 --> 28:39.166
when I heard the gunshots.

28:45.599 --> 28:48.119
Oliver, voice-over: The guards
must have gotten off a few shots.

28:48.177 --> 28:50.352
Oh, no.

28:53.423 --> 28:55.441
But when I got there...

28:59.188 --> 29:01.447
The killer was
standing over them.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.033
They were gone.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.196
Blood everywhere.

29:09.272 --> 29:12.783
And you got a good look
at who did it.

29:12.859 --> 29:14.451
Yeah.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.462
Then who was it?

29:18.466 --> 29:20.791
Oliver, then who was it?

29:20.801 --> 29:23.469
It was my sister.

29:27.975 --> 29:30.392
Emiko killed those guards.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.768
I can't believe we're
letting him go.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.154
Oliver queen is
protecting his sister.

29:42.231 --> 29:44.272
It makes sense.

29:44.349 --> 29:46.325
I don't know. Something
doesn't feel right.

29:46.401 --> 29:48.068
We don't have enough evidence

29:48.144 --> 29:49.611
to keep them here.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.613
Their stories line up.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.457
Mayor pollard agrees.

30:01.083 --> 30:04.793
So how's it look?

30:04.870 --> 30:06.753
Pollard bought it.

30:06.830 --> 30:09.631
Yeah, as far as the
scpd is concerned,

30:09.708 --> 30:13.343
emiko was the one who
killed those guards.

30:13.354 --> 30:16.188
You all are very,
very good liars.

30:16.265 --> 30:17.689
So are you, d.

30:19.527 --> 30:21.601
We know that this
wasn't easy for you.

30:21.678 --> 30:23.770
No, it wasn't.

30:23.847 --> 30:26.198
If anybody finds out
about what we did,

30:26.275 --> 30:28.024
our partnership with
the scpd is over.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.026
And the same goes for my job.

30:30.037 --> 30:32.195
We just risked everything.

30:32.206 --> 30:34.164
That's why we all had to agree.

30:36.359 --> 30:38.752
This was the only way.

30:58.140 --> 30:59.890
- I've got her.
- Rene.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.067
She's mine. Secure the device.

31:04.387 --> 31:05.779
I'll be fine. Go.

31:14.397 --> 31:16.164
Aah!

32:17.978 --> 32:21.146
Hey! What the hell's
going on down here?

32:23.350 --> 32:24.891
Vigilante attack in progress,

32:24.968 --> 32:26.318
hudolin mcguire Metro station.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.285
Roy!

32:44.362 --> 32:46.579
Roy, stop it! Look at me!

32:46.656 --> 32:48.090
Roy, stop!

33:04.233 --> 33:05.724
Rene! Rene, don't touch that.

33:12.866 --> 33:14.950
They're dead.

33:19.981 --> 33:21.248
What the hell happened here?

33:26.071 --> 33:27.713
What are we gonna do?

33:34.722 --> 33:36.430
We have to protect him.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.649
Two innocent people are dead,

33:56.726 --> 33:58.410
and we're covering it up.

33:58.487 --> 34:01.237
Dinah, if someone
on this team goes down,

34:01.248 --> 34:02.739
this entire team goes down.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.157
He's absolutely right.

34:04.234 --> 34:05.434
And if pollard knew the truth,

34:05.494 --> 34:06.659
we would be sitting in lockup

34:06.736 --> 34:08.036
while the city rehashes

34:08.112 --> 34:09.411
whether vigilantes
are a threat or not.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.039
Which would free emiko up

34:11.116 --> 34:13.041
for evil plan b.

34:13.118 --> 34:15.710
But Roy is not
a part of this team.

34:15.786 --> 34:17.587
He's been gone for months
doing who knows what.

34:17.598 --> 34:21.382
With due respect, you don't
know what he's been through.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.717
Roy is and always will be
as much a part of this team

34:23.795 --> 34:25.219
as the rest of us.

34:25.295 --> 34:27.013
Except the rest
of us don't go around

34:27.090 --> 34:28.440
killing innocent people.

34:28.516 --> 34:29.808
Dinah, as horrible as that was,

34:29.884 --> 34:31.643
let's not lose sight

34:31.652 --> 34:33.018
that we stopped
an attack tonight.

34:33.096 --> 34:34.353
And we framed emiko for murder.

34:34.429 --> 34:36.281
Emiko's a murderer,

34:36.358 --> 34:37.784
a murderer who's the leader
of the ninth circle.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.451
And as long as she is out there,

34:39.527 --> 34:41.277
this city will remain
under threat.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.112
I hope we can all agree on that.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.998
Yes.

34:46.943 --> 34:50.203
My search algorithms
are up and running.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.163
It might actually be a good time

34:52.239 --> 34:54.206
to go ask Roy what happened.

34:54.284 --> 34:56.967
I'm pretty sure I already know.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.718
That wasn't Mirakuru.

35:05.795 --> 35:07.604
No.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.475
How did it happen?

35:12.486 --> 35:15.103
What do you mean?

35:15.180 --> 35:17.614
How did you die?

35:21.811 --> 35:23.328
How did you know?

35:23.405 --> 35:26.739
You, thea, and nyssa
left here over a year ago

35:26.816 --> 35:29.117
in search of Lazarus pits,

35:29.194 --> 35:32.162
and I have not seen
bloodlust like that

35:32.238 --> 35:34.214
since thea
was resurrected by one.

35:36.326 --> 35:37.467
Damn it.

35:44.209 --> 35:47.427
To help, I need to
know what happened.

35:50.048 --> 35:52.691
The thanatos guild
had us surrounded.

35:52.767 --> 35:55.852
I tried to get thea to safety,

35:55.863 --> 35:59.314
but I was hit with an arrow,

35:59.390 --> 36:01.950
which... which is ironic.

36:02.027 --> 36:04.360
I don't really remember
a lot after,

36:04.371 --> 36:06.779
except for... except for
seeing nyssa and thea

36:06.856 --> 36:08.323
destroy the pit.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.992
The one they used
to bring you back.

36:11.069 --> 36:12.544
Yeah.

36:12.621 --> 36:15.622
Nyssa had the lotus elixir.

36:15.698 --> 36:17.373
She and thea thought

36:17.384 --> 36:19.792
that we could control
the bloodlust, and we did.

36:19.869 --> 36:21.211
Until you didn't.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.463
I keep trying to figure out why.

36:23.539 --> 36:26.007
And all I can think of
is that maybe

36:26.084 --> 36:27.675
the Mirakuru changed something.

36:27.752 --> 36:31.179
You know, I never
would've come back here

36:31.256 --> 36:35.016
if I would've known what
was gonna happen.

36:35.093 --> 36:36.893
I never meant to hurt anyone.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.686
I know...

36:38.763 --> 36:42.398
But keeping this
information from us,

36:42.409 --> 36:44.817
it jeopardized
all the things that

36:44.894 --> 36:46.745
we have been working
for this year.

36:46.821 --> 36:48.863
I never asked you
to cover for me.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.199
I didn't want you to.

36:51.276 --> 36:52.584
You never have to ask me.

36:54.829 --> 36:57.339
Ever.

36:59.927 --> 37:02.210
Guys?

37:02.287 --> 37:04.137
Felicity has something.

37:06.841 --> 37:09.342
I expanded my search
parameters, and presto.

37:09.419 --> 37:10.843
Facial recognition puts emiko

37:10.920 --> 37:12.103
in an abandoned building

37:12.180 --> 37:13.440
a few miles outside
of star city.

37:13.464 --> 37:14.659
Any background on the building?

37:14.683 --> 37:16.107
I mean, you name it,
it's been it.

37:16.184 --> 37:17.433
Hospital, shipping warehouse,

37:17.510 --> 37:18.518
manufacturing plant.

37:18.594 --> 37:19.852
I mean, it's had more owners

37:19.929 --> 37:21.729
than a "fortune" 500 company.

37:21.806 --> 37:22.772
Which means it could be
a cover for something.

37:22.783 --> 37:24.023
Yeah, something being

37:24.100 --> 37:25.244
the ninth circle's headquarters

37:25.268 --> 37:26.693
here in star city.

37:26.769 --> 37:28.506
Emiko's there, which is
all that matters to us.

37:28.530 --> 37:30.622
We're going after her as a team.

37:30.699 --> 37:33.116
Are you sure?

37:33.126 --> 37:35.168
We got your back.

37:38.948 --> 37:41.800
Oh, hey, dinah! Thank you for
wiping that security camera footage.

37:41.876 --> 37:43.802
I could not get there
before the cops did.

37:43.878 --> 37:45.971
I thought that was you.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.479
No.

38:02.322 --> 38:03.646
Let's go wide.

38:03.657 --> 38:05.073
Arsenal, on my 6.

38:06.493 --> 38:08.276
Overwatch, any heat signatures?

38:08.353 --> 38:09.819
No. Not even yours.

38:09.896 --> 38:11.487
Thermal imaging can't penetrate

38:11.498 --> 38:14.282
through those walls.

38:15.744 --> 38:17.118
I have eyes on her.

38:17.195 --> 38:18.837
Moving to intercept.

38:21.366 --> 38:23.967
Oliver, confirm your location.

38:32.853 --> 38:34.052
This is over.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.687
Is it?

38:35.764 --> 38:37.305
Right now, sergeant bingsley

38:37.382 --> 38:38.973
is receiving an anonymous gift

38:39.050 --> 38:40.350
delivered to his office:

38:40.360 --> 38:41.901
The missing security footage

38:41.978 --> 38:43.570
from the Metro station.

38:43.646 --> 38:46.939
You're the one
who made it disappear?

38:47.016 --> 38:48.825
You set us up.

38:56.785 --> 38:58.201
What do you want?!

38:58.211 --> 39:00.536
For you to suffer
the way I suffered.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.955
You and your team are
gonna die in there.

39:03.032 --> 39:06.334
And I will be out there
destroying your legacy.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.711
You'll die a villain

39:08.722 --> 39:10.797
just like our father did,

39:10.873 --> 39:14.175
and I will be the cause
of both of your deaths.

39:14.252 --> 39:16.394
And justice will finally
be served.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.236
What did you say?

39:25.313 --> 39:26.979
I had the chance

39:27.056 --> 39:29.741
to warn our father
about the "gambit."

39:31.486 --> 39:33.403
It was rigged to explode,

39:33.413 --> 39:36.739
and I knew about it.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.157
I let our father die because he

39:38.168 --> 39:40.085
didn't deserve to live.

39:41.830 --> 39:44.047
And neither do you.

39:46.209 --> 39:47.675
Bye, brother.

40:02.275 --> 40:04.776
Oliver, do you read me?

40:04.853 --> 40:07.228
Does anybody copy?

40:07.305 --> 40:10.782
Oliver, come in.

40:10.859 --> 40:12.784
John?

40:12.861 --> 40:15.903
John, come in! Oliver?

40:15.980 --> 40:18.531
Come in, please!

40:18.608 --> 40:19.833
Come in!
