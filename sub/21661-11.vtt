MY BARTLEBY
You're busy, right? But I wanted to chat.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.017
MY BARTLEBY

01:45.146 --> 01:47.899
You're busy, right? I know.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.276
-But I wanted to chat anyway.
-Hi.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.821
I wanted comforting.

01:54.906 --> 01:58.368
I wanted you to tell me
that I'm not that bad a person.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.745
I'm whining.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.915
I feel like whining today.

02:20.765 --> 02:25.353
EPISODE 11
BETRAYING ONESELF #Disgrace

02:28.439 --> 02:30.900
MY CHEF

02:30.984 --> 02:32.569
MY CHEF
MISSING CALL

02:40.910 --> 02:41.828
Is this everyone?

02:43.037 --> 02:44.581
There are only five of you?

02:48.418 --> 02:51.254
I heard the five of you were looking
for Joann.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.009
Why were you looking for Joann?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.389
You don't want to answer?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.560
-Why were you looking for her?
-Because of the letter.

03:07.645 --> 03:08.646
What letter?

03:09.230 --> 03:11.316
I happened to find a letter

03:12.317 --> 03:14.152
and we thought Joann had written it.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.738
Where is it?

03:18.489 --> 03:19.991
Don't make me ask twice!

03:20.074 --> 03:21.284
The fridge!

03:21.784 --> 03:24.203
The fridge.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.080
It's on the fridge.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.500
Hey, you. Go get it.

03:53.816 --> 03:54.859
Read it.

04:01.532 --> 04:02.784
Something happened, didn't it?

04:03.368 --> 04:05.703
I should be with you
at times like these. Sorry.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.665
"Yes, you're the one who ruined my life."

04:08.748 --> 04:09.999
You're a good person.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.086
"I'm a mess because of you,
but you've become a college student.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.464
-Don't worry. Whine away.
-You were laughing, all happy.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.508
I'm sure you will go on being happy,

04:18.591 --> 04:21.177
-without knowing you ruined my life.
-Thank you for whining to me.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.055
-Merry Christmas.
-I miss you, too.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.766
I won't forgive you.
I'll be sure you never laugh again.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.601
I'll slit your smiling mouth.

04:29.727 --> 04:32.981
I'll make you feel the pain that I felt.
I'll kill you."

04:33.564 --> 04:36.067
MY CHEF
Everything's going to be okay.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.196
What a bitch.

04:42.073 --> 04:46.828
You ruined someone else's life
but laughed like there was nothing wrong.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.204
Who's the bitch?

04:55.503 --> 04:56.546
Hey.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.215
Tie them up.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.179
Ye-eun.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.602
If you won't listen
because you think you're so smart...

05:11.686 --> 05:12.937
She's sick!

05:15.273 --> 05:18.359
I'll do it. Let me do it.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.819
Ye-eun.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.487
Go on.

05:27.201 --> 05:30.330
Don't worry. It's okay.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.837
Go. Tie their hands.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.028
Hey. Tighten it.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.571
Okay.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.202
Sorry.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.835
It's okay.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.801
Ye-eun.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.187
I'm sorry.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.821
Hands.

06:50.743 --> 06:51.577
Are you okay?

06:59.210 --> 07:00.336
Jin-myung.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.587
Jin-myung.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.050
Hands.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.138
Jin-myung.

07:26.904 --> 07:27.947
So?

07:29.157 --> 07:30.241
Who is it?

07:31.367 --> 07:32.326
Who ruined Joann's life?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.042
You?

07:48.801 --> 07:49.844
We don't know.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.680
Seriously.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.101
-Please stop.
-What?

07:57.685 --> 07:59.187
We really don't know.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.482
We don't know who Joann is.
That's why we went to find her.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.026
If we knew,
we wouldn't have looked for her.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.280
Hey.

08:11.949 --> 08:12.867
Look.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.584
You don't know her?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.586
You really don't?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.547
Shit.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.718
What now? What do I do with you punks?

08:33.262 --> 08:34.263
What should I do?

08:35.223 --> 08:36.849
Should I kill them all, Hyo-jin?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.028
It's 9:52 p.m.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.864
I'll give you eight minutes.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.116
Tell me within that time.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.581
It's Hyo-jin, right?

09:02.083 --> 09:03.334
That's her name.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.796
That's right. Hyo-jin Moon.

09:09.298 --> 09:12.885
Then you can just ask her. Hyo-jin Moon.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.012
-Don't do this here...
-I can't ask her.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.306
Why not?

09:18.724 --> 09:19.934
She killed herself.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.937
She died. Shit.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.193
-When did she die?
-Last March.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.947
Why did she die so suddenly for no reason?

09:33.030 --> 09:34.282
One of you should know that.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.868
She was never happy
about living to begin with.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.162
She was always frowning,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.583
but she laughed
on the last day she visited me in jail.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.875
She even made jokes.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.546
So, I wondered what was wrong.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.091
They say people change
just before they die.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.428
But I didn't know that.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.722
I was an idiot.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.140
No.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.893
Was it you?

10:11.360 --> 10:12.486
Ji-won.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.073
Ji-won.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.168
It was you?

10:31.005 --> 10:32.340
It was you, is that it?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.639
What did you do to Hyo-jin?

10:43.559 --> 10:44.602
I don't know.

10:45.936 --> 10:46.979
I don't know.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.650
-I know...
-Ji-won!

10:51.359 --> 10:53.194
I did something bad,

10:54.445 --> 10:55.696
but I don't know what...

10:59.992 --> 11:02.495
You're a piece of garbage.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.163
Hey.

11:04.413 --> 11:11.337
I've done many bad things in my life,
but at least I can't sleep at times

11:11.671 --> 11:13.339
and I even have nightmares.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.674
But you don't remember what you did?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.260
What will you do?

11:18.928 --> 11:19.929
-Let go.
-Let go.

11:20.012 --> 11:23.516
-Hey. Move.
-Please don't hurt her.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.810
-No.
-What are you doing?

11:26.852 --> 11:27.686
Hey!

11:28.187 --> 11:29.355
Hey!

11:30.773 --> 11:31.816
Ye-eun.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.442
Ye-eun.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.819
Why you...

11:35.403 --> 11:36.362
Get over here.

11:36.946 --> 11:37.863
Hyo-jin.

11:40.741 --> 11:41.784
Ye-eun.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.330
Ye-eun!

11:50.126 --> 11:51.585
Ye-eun.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.213
Wake up. Ye-eun! Wake up.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.507
Ye-eun.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.182
Hey, you.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.018
Is this you?

12:14.692 --> 12:15.943
Year 2004.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.572
Third grade?

12:24.785 --> 12:26.787
When was your life ruined?

12:29.874 --> 12:30.791
When I was born.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.503
I think mine was ruined
when I was in the third grade.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.506
That's when bad things started happening.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.968
Close the window. It's cold.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.027
Do something for me.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.241
Kill someone for me.

13:11.540 --> 13:12.374
Who?

13:13.751 --> 13:14.752
I'll tell you later.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.009
Why later?

13:22.801 --> 13:24.053
Let's do it now.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.263
No. Later.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.266
If it doesn't work after I try everything,

13:30.518 --> 13:31.602
do it then.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.320
Just what did you do?

13:47.535 --> 13:48.619
I don't know.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.750
Forget it.

13:54.833 --> 13:58.254
Still, you did something bad to her,

13:58.546 --> 14:01.799
and I need to grant her wish
to feel better,

14:04.134 --> 14:05.427
so let's go.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.096
-No.
-What will you do?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.099
-This is exactly what Hyo-jin wanted!
-And what is that?

14:26.615 --> 14:27.783
Ye-eun!

14:29.076 --> 14:31.203
Ye-eun!

14:31.287 --> 14:32.788
Ye-eun, breathe!

14:32.872 --> 14:34.582
Ye-eun.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.833
Ye-eun. Breathe.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.128
Slowly.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.672
Ye-eun. Look at me!

14:42.590 --> 14:43.632
Slowly. It's okay.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.801
It's okay.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.389
It's okay. Ye-eun!

14:51.307 --> 14:52.892
It's okay.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.189
Call the police.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.192
Ji-won, snap out of it.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.945
Hey. Snap out of it.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.031
Breathe.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.747
-Jin-myung.
-Shit.

15:40.522 --> 15:41.690
Eun-jae.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.658
Stop it!

15:53.243 --> 15:55.663
Stop it. Stop...

15:56.872 --> 15:58.248
Stop it.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.087
I'll go with you.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.381
I'll just go.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.093
I'm the one who did it,

16:10.844 --> 16:12.513
so I'll just go.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.025
She was in the third grade.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.696
She was ten. She was just a child.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.031
Just a child.

16:32.074 --> 16:32.992
Young

16:33.909 --> 16:34.743
or old,

16:36.412 --> 16:38.747
if you do wrong, you must be punished.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.254
The letter says

16:45.587 --> 16:48.799
that she'll make her feel
her pain and kill her.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.388
It's strange. Three months have passed.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.850
That letter was from December.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.102
You said Hyo-jin died last March.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.522
She didn't do anything for three months.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.067
If she really wanted to kill her,
she would have done something.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.778
So why didn't she? Why?

17:11.488 --> 17:12.823
No, later.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.495
If it doesn't work after I try everything,

17:19.747 --> 17:20.789
do it then.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.009
Now is later.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.389
No.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.932
No!

17:39.933 --> 17:43.145
She can't be punished
without knowing what she did!

17:43.687 --> 17:45.105
Move.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.524
She should know what she did!

17:47.608 --> 17:48.776
Move!

17:50.360 --> 17:52.362
Shit. Seriously.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.364
Should I kill you all?

17:54.448 --> 17:56.116
Move! Please.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.036
-Ji-won.
-You won't move?

17:59.119 --> 18:00.954
I'll kill you all!

18:01.038 --> 18:04.666
Please, don't take her! Don't take her!

18:05.167 --> 18:07.753
Please, don't take her! Don't kill her.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.715
Hey! You heard it, too!

18:12.508 --> 18:14.009
She said she did something bad!

18:14.635 --> 18:16.553
She said she ruined Hyo-jin's life!

18:18.430 --> 18:20.474
She isn't a bad person!

18:21.934 --> 18:23.644
Why you...

18:24.353 --> 18:26.897
Shit!

18:29.191 --> 18:30.192
Ji-won.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.569
Come here.

18:32.694 --> 18:33.987
Come here!

18:34.071 --> 18:36.865
Shit!

18:38.325 --> 18:39.243
Shit.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.870
Damn it.

18:41.954 --> 18:42.996
Shit.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.502
Come here.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.712
Hey, you.

18:52.172 --> 18:55.926
Why did you bully Hyo-jin only?

18:57.427 --> 18:58.303
Why?

19:27.708 --> 19:28.542
I'm sorry.

19:31.962 --> 19:32.796
I'm sorry.

19:40.804 --> 19:41.889
I'm sorry.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.602
That hurts!

19:46.685 --> 19:47.603
I'm sorry.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.573
I'm sorry.
I'm the only one who isn't hurt.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.284
Are you okay?

20:04.828 --> 20:06.622
I'm sorry.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.257
I'm sorry.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.945
Did you have a bad dream?

20:39.947 --> 20:40.864
Yes.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.113
-Are you up?
-Yes.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.245
Where is Ji-won?

21:28.578 --> 21:29.413
She's asleep.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.792
But I'm not sure if she's really asleep
or just pretending to be.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.755
Are you going to work?

21:40.590 --> 21:41.675
Yes, I should.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.928
It's strange.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.348
After what happened last night,

21:49.391 --> 21:51.810
today is just like any other day.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.064
Going to work, going to school...

21:59.318 --> 22:00.819
I wonder if this is right.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.238
I know.

22:04.406 --> 22:05.949
We almost died.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.077
I feel like things should change.

22:12.247 --> 22:13.582
Is it really okay

22:14.708 --> 22:16.752
not to call the police?

22:20.922 --> 22:21.923
What if...

22:23.050 --> 22:24.134
he comes back?

22:26.803 --> 22:28.513
I think we should tell the police.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.433
Why is Ji-won saying

22:32.267 --> 22:34.895
that we shouldn't tell the police?

23:07.928 --> 23:10.263
Wet paint

23:32.869 --> 23:34.162
It's strange.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.040
After what happened last night,

23:38.125 --> 23:40.502
today is just like any other day.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.255
I wonder if this is right.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.090
Mr. Lee.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.014
-Hello.
-Hello.

23:54.349 --> 23:56.810
I wanted to ask you something
about Heimdallr.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.731
Is there anyone
who might be able to reach him?

24:01.815 --> 24:04.776
A friend, relative,
or someone he visits frequently?

24:09.281 --> 24:10.115
Excuse me!

24:12.325 --> 24:13.160
Is anyone there?

24:19.124 --> 24:21.001
We aren't open yet.

24:23.503 --> 24:26.006
It says right there
that we open at 3:00 p.m.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.425
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.138
-You know Heimdallr, right?
-Who?

24:33.847 --> 24:35.182
Jin-gwang Lee.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.644
Jin-gwang? Yes. Why do you ask?

24:40.395 --> 24:42.314
Have you seen or heard from him recently?

24:44.900 --> 24:46.902
Maybe on July 18th?

24:47.152 --> 24:48.778
The day after Constitution Day.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.240
Did you see him last September?
Or heard from him?

24:53.700 --> 24:56.369
No. Why are you looking for him, though?

24:56.661 --> 24:58.163
If you hear from him,

24:59.206 --> 25:00.457
please give me a call.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.546
If you hear from Jin-gwang,
please give me a call.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.125
You carry it.

25:45.168 --> 25:47.128
-You carry it.
-Don't give it to me.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.296
Seriously.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.592
Hey. It's hot, right?

25:54.302 --> 25:55.804
Drink this.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.898
Jong-yeoul.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.860
-So that's how it ended up.
-What?

26:10.944 --> 26:13.363
-You guys are back together.
-We are not.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.156
Then what's that?

26:22.205 --> 26:24.332
-Jong-yeoul.
-What's wrong?

26:26.710 --> 26:27.794
It's cold.

26:27.877 --> 26:28.920
You punk.

27:10.378 --> 27:13.006
What happened to your face?

27:14.382 --> 27:15.592
Just... It's nothing.

27:17.635 --> 27:18.636
I wasn't hit.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.223
I just got hurt.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.852
I heard Yoo-kyung fainted.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.023
She's in the hospital.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.151
She fainted in the bathroom
in the middle of the night.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.697
-Don't tell me...
-She didn't take sleeping pills.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.158
Her intestines were tangled.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.244
But she hasn't said anything
since she woke up.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.206
What does that mean?

27:47.874 --> 27:51.002
The doctor told her
to get psychiatric help.

27:56.841 --> 27:57.675
Whatever.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.891
Among the communications models,

28:04.974 --> 28:06.935
the most representative model

28:07.018 --> 28:09.396
is the model developed
by Shannon and Weaver.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.314
It's in the book.

28:11.564 --> 28:14.567
This model accounts for the process

28:14.651 --> 28:18.738
which consists of the message, source,
medium, destination, and receiver.

28:19.239 --> 28:22.534
But, there are
some pitfalls of this model...

28:22.617 --> 28:23.576
See you tomorrow.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.286
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

28:43.346 --> 28:44.222
Hi.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.100
I need to tell you something.

28:48.685 --> 28:49.561
What is it?

29:11.541 --> 29:12.459
Sorry.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.212
Don't be too angry.

29:18.256 --> 29:21.217
I won't meddle in your relationship
with Jang-hoon anymore.

29:23.928 --> 29:24.971
That's not it.

29:26.723 --> 29:27.682
Well...

29:28.391 --> 29:30.351
Actually, it's about that, but...

29:38.234 --> 29:41.112
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.119
I lied to you.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.164
Jang-hoon and I...

29:52.373 --> 29:53.416
never dated.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.586
What?

30:00.965 --> 30:04.260
We only pretended to date.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.348
Why?

30:16.523 --> 30:17.398
Was I...

30:17.982 --> 30:19.359
Was I too obsessive again?

30:19.901 --> 30:22.654
Was I too clingy? Did I annoy you?

30:26.241 --> 30:27.075
I see.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.497
Then you should have just said so.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.450
"I'LL OBEY ONLY THE TRUTH."

31:17.959 --> 31:19.502
-Hello.
-Hello.

31:19.586 --> 31:20.503
Hi.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.717
Sunglasses. Someone must have hit you.

31:26.968 --> 31:27.844
Smart boy.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.600
You're taking the test next year.
Start studying early.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.603
-What about you?
-As you can see,

31:36.978 --> 31:38.229
they're practically new.

31:38.396 --> 31:42.066
I considered selling them,
but I was reminded of you.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.404
Cry. Shed emotional tears.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.574
Aren't you taking the test?
Aren't you getting a job?

31:50.033 --> 31:52.744
I will get a job,
but I won't take the media company test.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.416
I can't.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.170
See you later.

32:11.471 --> 32:12.305
What?

32:18.519 --> 32:19.354
Hey.

32:21.856 --> 32:22.690
What is this?

32:24.192 --> 32:25.193
Colorful, right?

32:29.155 --> 32:30.406
I found Hyo-jin.

32:41.584 --> 32:43.169
I know how you feel.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.630
You don't know what to say, right?

32:53.179 --> 32:55.348
Do you remember that old story?

32:57.433 --> 32:59.936
A king gives his son a letter

33:00.728 --> 33:02.939
to deliver to a neighboring king.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.109
The prince barely survives the trip,

33:06.985 --> 33:09.237
and finally hands the king the letter.

33:10.905 --> 33:13.366
But what it said in the letter was,

33:16.411 --> 33:18.246
"Kill the man
who brought you this letter."

33:21.791 --> 33:23.084
That's how I feel.

33:25.294 --> 33:26.671
We should have

33:28.089 --> 33:29.841
thrown away that strange letter.

33:31.092 --> 33:31.926
Right?

33:33.761 --> 33:35.263
I shouldn't have found out,

33:36.472 --> 33:37.432
right?

33:40.351 --> 33:41.561
You never know.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.272
You don't remember what you did.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.650
You're right. I don't know.
I don't remember.

33:49.444 --> 33:52.113
But it's easy to deduce, don't you think?

33:55.241 --> 33:57.452
Create a story
based purely on the facts we have,

33:57.535 --> 33:59.120
as if you're writing an article.

34:00.163 --> 34:03.541
Don't be nice because it's about me,
and don't pity me.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.251
Be objective.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.972
In the summer of third grade,
Ji-won Song became a liar.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.808
She told outrageous lies,

34:21.601 --> 34:23.603
and one of them was about Hyo-jin Moon.

34:24.854 --> 34:25.938
The reasons are unknown.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.524
Perhaps puberty came early,

34:29.484 --> 34:32.070
or perhaps she was jealous
of Hyo-jin's pretty shoes.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.281
But unlike the other lies,

34:36.157 --> 34:39.243
the lie about Hyo-jin became a problem.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.872
Rumors began spreading
throughout the school.

34:44.540 --> 34:47.126
Eventually, Hyo-jin ended up
transferring out.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.839
Hyo-jin's life was utterly destroyed
because of it.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.676
Her mother died from the stress.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.680
She was an unwelcome guest at her
uncle's house and eventually ran away.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.183
She dated a low-life,

35:03.309 --> 35:04.727
suffered from depression,

35:06.062 --> 35:07.897
and then she saw me.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.859
Look at me. Aren't I sexy?

35:13.778 --> 35:17.782
She said I was laughing, all happy.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.870
Hyo-jin left a letter filled with hatred.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.623
Then three months later,

35:26.457 --> 35:28.084
she took her own life.

35:30.586 --> 35:31.420
Editor.

35:33.339 --> 35:34.924
Was any of that strange?

35:38.302 --> 35:39.637
Crosscheck.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.393
Sung-min. You were funny just now.

36:01.576 --> 36:02.743
What do you plan to do?

36:06.038 --> 36:06.914
I don't know.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.796
I'll be miserable for a while,

36:14.839 --> 36:16.507
feel a little guilty,

36:17.884 --> 36:19.802
and when I feel
that I almost forgot about it,

36:20.386 --> 36:22.430
I'll try to live my life again.

36:23.639 --> 36:26.434
I can't die just because of
what happened in the past.

36:29.645 --> 36:30.855
Whatever you decide,

36:31.939 --> 36:33.191
don't do it now.

36:34.901 --> 36:35.735
Okay.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.113
I'll be fine eventually,

36:40.865 --> 36:41.991
right?

36:47.079 --> 36:47.914
Good night.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.873
UNIVERSITY JOURNALISM AWARD
JI-WON SONG

37:35.253 --> 37:36.921
-Hey.
-Hi.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.885
You went around looking like that?

37:44.220 --> 37:47.640
No wonder people were staring.
I thought it was because I was pretty.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.100
Ji-won.

37:52.687 --> 37:53.521
Why was this...

37:54.730 --> 37:55.982
I threw it out.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.235
Why? Is that not recyclable?

38:05.408 --> 38:07.952
I thought nothing had changed.

38:10.037 --> 38:11.163
I guess I was wrong.

38:20.798 --> 38:23.092
Wet paint

38:32.310 --> 38:34.145
Oh no. It got darker.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.701
Wet paint

38:55.916 --> 38:58.919
SANGMO HARDWARE STORE

39:13.309 --> 39:14.143
I'm sorry.

39:49.762 --> 39:51.347
PUSH BUTTON FOR CROSSING

39:55.101 --> 39:56.060
Where are you going?

39:56.936 --> 39:59.146
-The playground.
-Alone?

40:00.689 --> 40:02.900
I'm bored. Daddy won't wake up.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.236
He just keeps sleeping.

40:42.064 --> 40:44.316
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

40:47.403 --> 40:48.988
Do you know Mommy's number?

40:58.664 --> 41:01.167
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

41:04.795 --> 41:05.671
Who's this?

41:11.427 --> 41:12.595
What happened?

41:12.928 --> 41:14.472
They're running some tests.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.474
Hyun.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.850
Mommy!

41:21.645 --> 41:24.231
Mommy. It's a sister.

41:25.024 --> 41:26.817
It's not a brother, she's a sister.

41:29.069 --> 41:30.488
Who is Young-hak Cho's guardian?

41:31.113 --> 41:33.491
-I am.
-Please come with me.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.747
What are you doing? Come here.

41:45.169 --> 41:48.005
Luckily, he was found right away.

41:48.714 --> 41:50.549
We gave him a blood thinner.

41:50.925 --> 41:53.719
It isn't serious,
so we won't need to operate on him.

41:54.220 --> 41:56.096
But there may be some lingering effects,

41:56.180 --> 42:00.684
so he should stay for a few days
and have some tests run on him.

42:07.441 --> 42:09.652
I'll fill out his admission papers.
Wait here.

42:11.862 --> 42:13.489
Don't let just anyone in.

42:23.082 --> 42:24.166
He had a stroke.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.252
It wasn't serious.

42:28.587 --> 42:30.214
So, he doesn't need to have an operation.

42:30.839 --> 42:32.675
They want to put him on medication.

42:36.136 --> 42:38.973
Excuse me.
Would you please watch Hyun for a while?

42:39.765 --> 42:42.184
I was in a hurry,
so I didn't bring anything for him.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.562
I should bring him some clothes and...

42:52.945 --> 42:53.862
Thank you.

43:33.819 --> 43:34.945
Mommy.

43:35.821 --> 43:38.866
Mommy went home for a little bit.
She'll be back soon.

43:43.662 --> 43:46.498
Don't cry. I'll get mad if you cry.

43:55.299 --> 43:57.426
My hair is ruined.

43:59.511 --> 44:00.763
I'll tie it for you.

44:22.451 --> 44:26.080
Did Daddy do your hair for you?

44:28.332 --> 44:29.166
Yes.

44:44.348 --> 44:47.393
What is this? It's weird.

44:48.102 --> 44:51.397
It's lumpy. Can't you even tie hair?

44:56.985 --> 44:58.320
Eun.

44:59.488 --> 45:00.406
Are you crying?

45:02.741 --> 45:03.951
Eun.

45:08.664 --> 45:09.915
Don't cry.

45:55.711 --> 45:56.628
Where have you been?

45:58.464 --> 45:59.673
My mom wanted me home.

46:00.632 --> 46:02.593
She wanted to take a family photo
before I left.

46:03.719 --> 46:06.138
You should have said you were going.

46:06.889 --> 46:09.808
-Do I need to tell you?
-You're here as the landlord.

46:11.226 --> 46:13.145
Did something happen while I was away?

46:13.937 --> 46:14.771
Yes.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.065
What?

46:21.445 --> 46:22.613
What?

46:23.614 --> 46:26.742
Were you lonely without me?
Did you miss me?

46:35.792 --> 46:36.793
Yes.

46:38.128 --> 46:39.004
Yes what?

46:42.424 --> 46:43.842
I was lonely without you.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.056
I missed you.

47:21.713 --> 47:22.714
Hey.

47:23.882 --> 47:24.883
Hi.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.389
COMIC BOOK CAFE

47:33.809 --> 47:35.435
Hello? Jin-myung Yoon speaking.

47:38.522 --> 47:42.234
It was my spot. It was originally my spot.

47:43.068 --> 47:45.237
Did you buy it? Do you have a contract?

47:46.321 --> 47:48.323
You don't own the seat.

47:52.119 --> 47:53.245
You're constipated, right?

47:53.620 --> 47:56.123
That's why you live that way.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.208
Like you're doing so well.

47:58.750 --> 47:59.960
What a great life you have.

48:00.043 --> 48:03.297
-I wear only designer brands.
-Why you little...

48:03.422 --> 48:06.258
Whatever. You pathetic penniless loser.

48:06.341 --> 48:09.970
-I think you need a good beating.
-Want to hit me? You'll end up in jail.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.068
How may I help you?

48:30.616 --> 48:31.825
I'm Jin-gwang's sister.

48:36.371 --> 48:38.540
If he couldn't come, he didn't have to.

48:39.207 --> 48:40.917
Why did he call people and crap?

48:42.753 --> 48:44.921
-Where are you going?
-What's it to you?

48:46.590 --> 48:47.633
Let's talk.

48:51.428 --> 48:53.013
Have you been living on the street?

48:55.474 --> 48:57.768
Do you know
your parents are looking for you?

49:06.943 --> 49:08.487
I'm too hungry to even run.

49:10.572 --> 49:12.032
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

49:14.493 --> 49:16.036
It isn't just dinner.

49:33.303 --> 49:34.721
I should have had something cold.

49:55.117 --> 49:57.369
Excuse me. More kimchi, please.

50:19.766 --> 50:20.767
It wasn't bad.

50:22.310 --> 50:23.729
Are you done?

50:26.606 --> 50:28.984
-Let's go.
-Where?

50:30.235 --> 50:31.528
Don't you want to wash up?

50:31.778 --> 50:34.030
What? Just because
I didn't wash for a few days...

50:41.788 --> 50:45.083
I'm really sorry.
It will just be for a few days.

50:45.333 --> 50:46.251
It's fine.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.921
-Hello.
-Hello.

50:50.881 --> 50:51.715
Come in.

50:53.759 --> 50:54.593
Grab your things.

51:01.933 --> 51:03.935
-I'll take that.
-No, it's okay.

51:04.019 --> 51:05.020
It's okay.

51:05.103 --> 51:07.147
-It's okay.
-It's really okay.

51:12.110 --> 51:13.361
Wash up and go to sleep.

51:41.973 --> 51:44.351
-Here is your pillow and blanket.
-Thanks.

51:46.102 --> 51:47.062
The couch is over there.

51:47.395 --> 51:48.396
Okay.

51:50.774 --> 51:53.735
Excuse me. Do you have a spare shirt?

51:55.987 --> 51:57.531
Go sit down. I'll bring it to you.

51:58.657 --> 51:59.658
Okay.

52:12.671 --> 52:15.090
Dating an ex is like reading a book
you've already read.

52:16.758 --> 52:20.345
I heard this song recently
and thought of you.

52:21.012 --> 52:22.305
Give it a listen.

52:47.289 --> 52:49.207
When will it go away?

52:50.959 --> 52:52.252
I need to stop by my locker.

52:52.335 --> 52:53.378
-We'll be out front.
-Okay.

52:53.461 --> 52:54.462
Okay.

53:49.434 --> 53:51.811
You drank last night, right?

54:51.162 --> 54:52.163
Hey.

54:54.416 --> 54:55.625
Why are you here?

55:01.965 --> 55:02.924
Did you come alone?

55:08.763 --> 55:10.223
What are you doing here?

55:14.394 --> 55:15.979
I was thinking about Hyo-jin.

55:17.439 --> 55:18.273
Why you...

55:22.277 --> 55:23.319
Hyo-jin probably...

55:26.489 --> 55:28.366
used to walk through this street, right?

55:32.037 --> 55:34.330
You seem to be very confused.

55:35.832 --> 55:37.292
I haven't forgiven you yet.

55:40.086 --> 55:40.920
One day,

55:42.047 --> 55:44.174
if I can't take it, I'll kill you.

55:47.594 --> 55:48.428
I know.

55:49.929 --> 55:50.889
That's why...

55:54.726 --> 55:56.436
Please tell me about Hyo-jin.

56:00.815 --> 56:01.775
What was...

56:03.943 --> 56:05.487
Hyo-jin like?

56:09.199 --> 56:10.033
Was she...

56:11.868 --> 56:12.994
pretty?

56:19.667 --> 56:20.877
She wasn't pretty.

56:21.795 --> 56:23.254
She always looked gloomy.

56:28.426 --> 56:29.969
Then why did you like her?

56:35.725 --> 56:37.018
Shit.

56:39.562 --> 56:40.396
What food...

56:42.190 --> 56:43.983
did she like?

56:49.072 --> 56:50.156
She liked noodles.

56:52.242 --> 56:53.993
It's not like she ate anything else.

56:59.249 --> 57:00.625
She liked to read, didn't she?

57:03.545 --> 57:04.462
Yes. It was annoying.

57:06.381 --> 57:08.550
I thought she didn't want to talk
to someone like me.

57:10.802 --> 57:11.886
Why do you think...

57:15.223 --> 57:16.724
Hyo-jin died?

57:18.726 --> 57:20.019
She didn't even get revenge.

57:29.737 --> 57:31.114
She should have gotten revenge.

57:33.366 --> 57:34.784
She shouldn't have died.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.956
She should have taken revenge on me.

57:44.085 --> 57:45.086
Stupid girl.

58:12.405 --> 58:14.532
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

58:17.243 --> 58:18.077
I ordered for us.

58:19.746 --> 58:20.830
Hold on.

58:30.048 --> 58:31.090
This is new.

58:33.343 --> 58:34.219
Come with me.

58:36.513 --> 58:37.347
Hold on.

58:39.766 --> 58:40.767
What?

58:44.979 --> 58:46.397
Here. Try these on.

58:54.948 --> 58:56.199
-Hello.
-Hello.

58:56.282 --> 58:57.575
What style would you like?

58:57.659 --> 58:59.160
Please get rid of this part.

59:13.841 --> 59:14.842
Hi, Eun-jae.

59:18.346 --> 59:19.222
Eun-jae...

59:34.362 --> 59:35.989
It was so funny.

59:38.366 --> 59:39.659
What's going on?

59:40.618 --> 59:43.913
You might think group counseling
and private counseling

59:43.997 --> 59:47.292
are completely different,
but that is not the case.

59:47.792 --> 59:50.461
There are many similarities,

59:50.837 --> 59:53.590
as well as differences between the two.

59:53.673 --> 59:54.799
For example,

59:54.882 --> 59:58.386
as you know already,
private counseling sessions are tailored

59:58.469 --> 59:59.679
to the individual's...

59:59.762 --> 1:00:01.014
Inflection point.

1:00:01.889 --> 1:00:04.517
a point of a curve
where a change in the direction

1:00:04.601 --> 1:00:06.019
of curvature occurs.

1:00:08.646 --> 1:00:11.065
That's right. It's a point of change.

1:00:12.525 --> 1:00:15.903
The area above the inflection point
does not have a direction.

1:00:17.030 --> 1:00:18.948
It has no meaning.

1:00:24.912 --> 1:00:27.332
It is only after
when parts are connected one after another

1:00:27.665 --> 1:00:29.917
can we appreciate
the meaning of that moment.

1:00:33.296 --> 1:00:35.506
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

1:00:43.723 --> 1:00:45.725
Do you have a class now?

1:00:46.017 --> 1:00:46.851
No, I don't.

1:00:46.934 --> 1:00:49.854
I know a place with really yummy cake.
Do you want to go?

1:00:49.937 --> 1:00:50.938
Where is it?

1:00:51.022 --> 1:00:52.190
You don't know at that moment.

1:00:52.273 --> 1:00:54.359
It isn't that far.

1:00:55.068 --> 1:00:56.986
You realize only after it has passed

1:00:59.113 --> 1:01:02.950
that you had passed the inflection point.

1:01:11.167 --> 1:01:12.543
Jong-yeoul!

1:01:19.592 --> 1:01:21.302
Sorry, I'm late.

1:01:22.762 --> 1:01:24.514
I came as soon as I saw the text.

1:01:25.473 --> 1:01:27.016
I didn't even dry my hair.

1:01:29.686 --> 1:01:30.895
Have a drink.

1:01:32.939 --> 1:01:35.316
It's been a really long time
since you and I drank

1:01:35.650 --> 1:01:37.193
with just the two of us.

1:02:03.261 --> 1:02:05.179
-Eun-jae.
-Jong-yeoul.

1:02:06.472 --> 1:02:08.725
I have something to tell you.

1:02:15.148 --> 1:02:18.276
I almost died recently.

1:02:20.361 --> 1:02:22.113
I really almost died.

1:02:23.489 --> 1:02:26.784
That made me think about this and that.

1:02:28.870 --> 1:02:30.079
If I had died then,

1:02:31.539 --> 1:02:33.124
what would have upset me most?

1:02:38.629 --> 1:02:39.797
I...

1:02:41.382 --> 1:02:42.633
I still like you.

1:02:46.971 --> 1:02:49.056
I don't want to break up with you.

1:02:56.147 --> 1:02:56.981
Eun-jae.

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:02.320
It's over between us.

1:03:07.033 --> 1:03:07.950
Stop this.

1:03:11.162 --> 1:03:11.996
Why?

1:03:16.751 --> 1:03:17.752
What do you mean?

1:03:18.419 --> 1:03:20.505
I still like you.

1:03:21.422 --> 1:03:23.674
You don't hate me, either.

1:03:27.512 --> 1:03:28.679
It's hard for me to say this.

1:03:30.306 --> 1:03:31.140
I...

1:03:35.770 --> 1:03:36.771
I don't like you.

1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:40.775
Then why did you text me before,
asking if I was sleeping?

1:03:43.319 --> 1:03:45.571
That was... I was drunk and...

1:03:45.655 --> 1:03:47.573
You didn't text the wrong person.

1:03:48.282 --> 1:03:49.992
You got drunk and thought of me,

1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:52.537
and texted me because you missed me.

1:03:52.995 --> 1:03:53.830
I know.

1:03:57.834 --> 1:04:00.169
Even if what I felt that day was true,

1:04:02.421 --> 1:04:03.798
I was just drunk.

1:04:06.676 --> 1:04:09.762
No. You still like me.

1:04:10.763 --> 1:04:11.889
Think about it.

1:04:13.099 --> 1:04:13.933
Eun-jae.

1:04:14.767 --> 1:04:15.810
Why are you doing this?

1:04:18.312 --> 1:04:19.522
You've been acting weird.

1:04:21.274 --> 1:04:22.400
You don't seem like yourself.

1:04:23.442 --> 1:04:25.903
You didn't like it
when I was being myself.

1:04:27.613 --> 1:04:29.323
That's why I'm trying to change.

1:04:31.033 --> 1:04:34.328
You said I was too passive and hesitant.

1:04:35.580 --> 1:04:36.998
You said I was frustrating.

1:04:38.291 --> 1:04:39.750
That's why I'm trying to change.

1:04:40.751 --> 1:04:41.794
I'll change.

1:04:44.589 --> 1:04:46.757
So, please...

1:04:47.884 --> 1:04:49.468
like me again.

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:16.829
What must I do to make you like me again?

1:05:20.249 --> 1:05:21.208
Sorry.

1:05:46.484 --> 1:05:49.445
It might be like the Nazca Lines.

1:05:54.158 --> 1:05:57.495
The lines appear meaningless,
but when you look at them from a distance,

1:05:57.912 --> 1:06:01.123
they become a phoenix or an alien.

1:06:16.347 --> 1:06:17.390
I'll take you home.

1:06:18.849 --> 1:06:20.017
This day...

1:06:26.315 --> 1:06:27.483
Let's go to a motel.

1:06:28.150 --> 1:06:29.610
This moment...

1:06:32.863 --> 1:06:35.574
I want to be with you.

1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:38.369
This statement...

1:06:40.913 --> 1:06:43.958
I thought about it,
and that's it, isn't it?

1:06:45.960 --> 1:06:50.172
It's because you wanted to sleep with me,
but I kept refusing.

1:06:59.098 --> 1:07:00.391
You're horrible.

1:07:02.351 --> 1:07:04.395
Not only were you pathetic just now,

1:07:05.771 --> 1:07:07.440
but you made me pathetic as well.

1:07:14.697 --> 1:07:17.158
Then what do you want me to do?
I like you!

1:07:18.826 --> 1:07:20.119
I still like you.

1:07:21.328 --> 1:07:23.748
Why did you say you liked me
if you were going to do this?

1:07:24.123 --> 1:07:25.541
You said you liked me first.

1:07:25.624 --> 1:07:28.961
How could you want to end it first,
when I still feel the same way?

1:07:41.891 --> 1:07:42.725
My...

1:07:43.976 --> 1:07:45.895
countless inflection points.

1:08:13.422 --> 1:08:17.134
-Apple picking? Out of the blue?
-I feel like it's necessary.

1:08:17.218 --> 1:08:19.053
I think we all need it.

1:08:19.136 --> 1:08:21.430
Did something happen to Eun-jae?

1:08:21.514 --> 1:08:23.349
Why don't you like me?

1:08:23.432 --> 1:08:26.352
-I'm joining the army soon.
-It's not like you're being deployed.

1:08:26.435 --> 1:08:28.562
-Will you wait for me?
-I'll think about it.

1:08:28.646 --> 1:08:30.523
Is the boy with glasses your boyfriend?

1:08:30.606 --> 1:08:32.358
I get sick if I eat breakfast.

1:08:32.441 --> 1:08:34.318
-Where is Ye-eun?
-She went that way.

1:08:34.401 --> 1:08:36.070
-Ye-eun!
-Where is Ji-won?

1:08:36.153 --> 1:08:39.365
I was like a baby then.
Can you say that child was bad?

1:08:39.448 --> 1:08:41.367
I didn't lie.

1:08:41.450 --> 1:08:42.701
Ji-won!

1:08:51.919 --> 1:08:53.504
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DATING?

1:08:53.587 --> 1:08:55.339
Three months? No, four months?

1:08:56.006 --> 1:08:59.468
It's exactly 53 days today

1:09:00.678 --> 1:09:02.888
since the first time we kissed.

1:09:04.515 --> 1:09:05.558
WHAT MADE YOU LIKE HER?

1:09:05.641 --> 1:09:06.475
She's pretty.

1:09:07.935 --> 1:09:09.061
IS SHE FRUSTRATING?

1:09:09.145 --> 1:09:11.105
She is a little, in a way,

1:09:13.315 --> 1:09:14.358
but she's pretty.

1:09:14.441 --> 1:09:15.609
SOME SAY SHE'S GLOOMY.

1:09:15.693 --> 1:09:16.735
True.

1:09:18.988 --> 1:09:19.947
But she's pretty.

1:09:20.030 --> 1:09:22.366
WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT HIM?

1:09:22.449 --> 1:09:24.910
He's kind, tall,

1:09:25.828 --> 1:09:27.663
and good looking.

1:09:29.248 --> 1:09:33.043
-Far away.
-He likes to walk, so hiking?

1:09:33.127 --> 1:09:34.670
-Anywhere far away.
-A park?

1:09:34.753 --> 1:09:35.921
As long as it's far away.

1:09:36.005 --> 1:09:39.466
Anywhere is fine,
as long as it's with him.

1:09:39.550 --> 1:09:42.178
If it's overnight, anywhere is good.

1:09:42.261 --> 1:09:43.721
IS SHE YOUR FIRST LOVE?

1:09:43.804 --> 1:09:45.681
No. I dated briefly
before I joined the army.

1:09:47.641 --> 1:09:49.685
THEY SAY FIRST LOVES DON'T WORK OUT.

1:09:49.768 --> 1:09:52.313
Who says that?
Those are all superstitions.

1:09:52.396 --> 1:09:54.315
Plus, it doesn't matter,

1:09:54.690 --> 1:09:58.110
since my first love was Woo-bin.

1:09:59.445 --> 1:10:01.530
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:10:02.865 --> 1:10:04.325
May we go now?

1:10:05.075 --> 1:10:05.993
Thank you.

1:10:06.076 --> 1:10:07.703
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:10:08.329 --> 1:10:10.039
-You must be tired.
-I'm okay.

1:10:10.122 --> 1:10:13.959
WE HOPE YOU'LL BE HAPPY TOGETHER.

1:10:14.043 --> 1:10:15.502
Oh, no.

1:10:15.586 --> 1:10:16.712
Sorry.

1:10:16.795 --> 1:10:18.422
Let's go.

1:10:19.298 --> 1:10:20.341
So cool.

1:10:20.841 --> 1:10:23.093
