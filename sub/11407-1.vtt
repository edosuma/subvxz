<i>SUBTITLES BY LUIS-SUBS</i>

03:40.747 --> 03:42.666
Swann.

03:49.006 --> 03:53.776
And the fire said to me...
said to me...

03:56.597 --> 03:58.515
"Nix, Nix,

03:58.599 --> 04:00.934
you are my instrument.

04:02.019 --> 04:04.730
From now on you shall be known...

04:04.813 --> 04:06.273
as...

04:08.233 --> 04:10.027
the Puritan.

04:11.028 --> 04:14.031
You will find a few good men...

04:14.114 --> 04:15.616
and women...

04:17.743 --> 04:20.161
and together...

04:21.704 --> 04:23.624
together...

04:25.792 --> 04:28.253
you will cleanse the world."

04:31.298 --> 04:33.091
Master.

04:36.136 --> 04:38.055
Swann's here.

04:52.903 --> 04:54.821
Are we ready?

04:56.657 --> 04:59.451
- Ready.
- Maybe we should think about this.

04:59.535 --> 05:02.120
He's gone too far.

05:02.162 --> 05:03.789
So he took a kid.

05:03.830 --> 05:05.415
He's gonna kill her.

05:05.499 --> 05:07.793
He could drive us crazy.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.962
So stay out here!

05:15.509 --> 05:17.636
Please get away from me.

05:23.267 --> 05:24.309
Hush!

05:24.393 --> 05:27.354
Please don't hurt me!

05:29.481 --> 05:32.150
I said, hush.

05:39.116 --> 05:40.325
What is it?

05:47.207 --> 05:49.710
What's the matter, huh?

05:51.211 --> 05:52.462
Please! Please!

05:54.715 --> 05:57.175
What are you gonna do to me?

06:01.930 --> 06:03.807
Leave me alone!

06:05.726 --> 06:07.853
Want me to shoot, Swann?

06:08.437 --> 06:09.813
Leave me alone!

06:09.897 --> 06:12.149
You don't like him, do you?

06:13.567 --> 06:16.695
- He wants her magic.
- Maybe.

06:16.737 --> 06:18.864
Go! Fetch him.

06:23.327 --> 06:25.746
I think he's in love.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.169
If you see the kid, yell.

06:37.966 --> 06:39.676
- Quaid.
- Hey, man.

06:40.469 --> 06:42.262
It's Quaid.

06:45.724 --> 06:48.060
I thought you weren't coming back.

06:48.936 --> 06:50.854
I changed my mind.

06:53.774 --> 06:56.109
You can't leave, man.

06:56.193 --> 06:58.111
He won't let you.

07:25.097 --> 07:27.015
You're gonna be okay.

07:27.099 --> 07:28.433
Okay?

07:43.448 --> 07:45.158
I knew you'd come.

07:46.326 --> 07:49.288
I've got so much power
to give you, Swann.

07:50.414 --> 07:52.332
All you have to do...

07:53.417 --> 07:54.668
is beg.

07:56.545 --> 07:57.796
Fuck you.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.341
You don't think that
I've got it to give?

08:03.010 --> 08:04.678
You're wrong!

08:08.056 --> 08:11.643
I could eat your fucking soul!

08:21.153 --> 08:23.530
Now be a good girl.

08:26.408 --> 08:27.534
Fuck!

08:27.618 --> 08:29.828
Stay here.

08:29.912 --> 08:32.623
- Jennifer, are you okay?
- Jesus!

08:35.208 --> 08:37.461
Stay away.

08:37.544 --> 08:39.462
Stay the fuck away.

08:49.056 --> 08:50.682
Are you okay?

08:52.226 --> 08:54.186
How would you like...

08:55.229 --> 08:56.647
to see the world...

08:56.730 --> 08:59.024
the way it really is?

08:59.066 --> 09:02.236
You wanna see flesh...
with a god's eyes?

09:32.808 --> 09:34.268
Swann?

09:35.310 --> 09:36.770
Here he is.

09:39.773 --> 09:41.858
Take a look, Swann.

09:44.861 --> 09:47.072
These are your friends.

10:08.510 --> 10:11.388
What have you done to him?

10:12.764 --> 10:14.975
- Swann...
- Don't touch me!

10:15.058 --> 10:17.311
He got into my head!

10:19.146 --> 10:21.231
You wanna be like that, Swann?

10:22.983 --> 10:25.944
Mud? Shit?

10:27.654 --> 10:30.199
Come here.

10:32.534 --> 10:35.287
Share the power.

11:07.110 --> 11:08.320
Swann.

11:09.071 --> 11:10.405
Help me.

11:20.082 --> 11:21.667
Bag.

11:28.674 --> 11:30.592
Help me.

11:30.676 --> 11:33.512
- What are you doing?
- Binding you.

11:33.595 --> 11:35.722
You piece of shit!

11:47.109 --> 11:49.903
This isn't over, Swann.

11:54.074 --> 11:55.117
This isn't finished.

12:41.366 --> 12:42.826
Dead?

12:46.538 --> 12:47.956
Dead.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.460
What now?

12:52.836 --> 12:55.088
We bury him so deep...

12:56.423 --> 12:58.884
no one will ever find him.

14:23.552 --> 14:26.471
I been calling you for
three days, Harry.

14:26.555 --> 14:28.473
I missed you too, Loomis.

14:29.641 --> 14:31.602
You got a beer?

14:40.319 --> 14:42.362
I got a job for you...

14:42.446 --> 14:45.449
if you can tear yourself away
from all this weird shit.

14:45.490 --> 14:48.201
You need a woman's touch in here.

14:48.285 --> 14:51.079
Why don't you get
yourself a secretary?

14:51.163 --> 14:52.831
On what you pay me?

14:53.916 --> 14:55.459
So get married.

14:57.628 --> 14:59.296
Tried that.

14:59.338 --> 15:00.797
Oh, yeah.

15:01.765 --> 15:04.977
"Harry D'Amour, who describes
himself as a private detective...

15:05.018 --> 15:08.230
has been linked with occult
activities on several occasions.

15:08.313 --> 15:12.484
'We regard D'Amour as a
highly dubious character...'

15:12.568 --> 15:13.861
quoted one source."

15:14.945 --> 15:16.363
That's nice, Harry.

15:17.948 --> 15:19.616
It's all bullshit.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.370
It was on TV last night.

15:23.454 --> 15:26.165
You looked like shit, by the way.

15:26.248 --> 15:28.125
- Thanks.
- What's the story?

15:28.167 --> 15:30.127
Was the kid really possessed?

15:33.672 --> 15:35.090
Probably.

15:38.886 --> 15:40.429
By what?

15:41.555 --> 15:43.849
You know.

15:43.932 --> 15:45.350
The usual.

15:46.518 --> 15:48.812
You need a vacation.

15:49.646 --> 15:52.191
Somewhere sunny, like...

15:52.274 --> 15:53.609
L.A.

15:53.692 --> 15:55.944
That's where the job is?

15:57.071 --> 15:59.990
Guy's name's Tapert.
Big insurance fraud.

16:00.032 --> 16:03.035
He's gone west to spend
his ill-gotten gains.

16:04.161 --> 16:05.662
It's worth ten grand...

16:05.704 --> 16:07.664
if you catch him doing it.

16:07.706 --> 16:08.832
If I don't?

16:10.125 --> 16:11.210
Catch a tan.

16:13.212 --> 16:15.672
I need someone of your
caliber on this, Harry.

16:22.888 --> 16:25.182
Taste the darkness, D'Amour.

16:25.224 --> 16:26.975
It's been waiting for you.

16:31.230 --> 16:35.275
Yeah, well, maybe I
do need a vacation.

16:35.359 --> 16:36.610
You'll like L.A.

16:36.694 --> 16:39.780
There's great weather, great women.

17:03.512 --> 17:05.556
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Have a nice evening.

17:05.638 --> 17:07.098
You bet.

17:11.729 --> 17:13.271
Hello, L.A.

17:25.951 --> 17:27.493
9:18 p.m.

17:29.538 --> 17:31.874
Tapert's paying by the hour.

17:31.957 --> 17:33.917
He's getting his money's worth.

17:45.804 --> 17:48.932
Come here, you fuckers! Come on in!

17:56.148 --> 17:57.441
Wait a minute.

17:57.483 --> 17:59.443
He's late for something.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.219
What the hell?

20:41.397 --> 20:43.315
Ever watched a man die?

20:45.484 --> 20:47.486
If you watch very closely...

20:47.569 --> 20:51.031
you can sometimes see
the soul escaping.

20:54.451 --> 20:57.204
And if you're very quick...

20:57.287 --> 20:58.831
you can catch it.

21:02.334 --> 21:04.211
I wasn't there.

21:07.548 --> 21:09.466
Ask Pimm.

21:09.550 --> 21:10.968
Pimm's dead.

21:13.262 --> 21:15.723
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.

21:18.350 --> 21:21.395
They knew the Puritan
was coming home.

21:21.478 --> 21:23.230
So did you.

21:52.051 --> 21:53.469
Wait.

21:53.552 --> 21:54.970
Don't leave me.

22:05.856 --> 22:07.983
Did you come for a reading?

22:14.490 --> 22:15.574
My God.

22:15.657 --> 22:17.451
What?

22:17.493 --> 22:20.746
You are drawn to the dark side...

22:22.331 --> 22:24.291
over and over.

22:25.084 --> 22:26.668
You don't like that.

22:26.752 --> 22:28.170
Not much.

22:29.838 --> 22:32.549
You can't change it.

22:32.633 --> 22:35.344
You must walk the line...

22:35.427 --> 22:37.346
between heaven and hell.

22:39.348 --> 22:41.308
It is your destiny.

22:42.393 --> 22:43.852
Accept it.

22:47.189 --> 22:49.149
Hang on.

22:50.025 --> 22:51.944
I'm not afraid to die.

22:56.740 --> 22:59.410
There's something terrible...

22:59.493 --> 23:02.329
coming home soon.

23:03.372 --> 23:04.415
The Puritan?

23:08.460 --> 23:10.295
Who is he?

23:16.385 --> 23:17.803
Shit.

23:37.906 --> 23:39.867
What were you doing up here?

23:39.908 --> 23:41.368
I'm a private detective.

23:41.410 --> 23:45.372
I was hired to follow a guy named
Tapert for a couple of days.

23:45.414 --> 23:48.125
- Insurance fraud.
- Tapert.

23:48.208 --> 23:51.003
So now I've got Tapert,
Butterfield...

23:51.086 --> 23:53.505
Tapert's got nothin'
to do with this.

23:53.589 --> 23:56.008
He just came to get his palm read.

23:58.761 --> 24:00.721
This is something else.

24:02.473 --> 24:04.933
You ever heard of somebody
called the Puritan?

24:04.975 --> 24:06.935
New one on me. Let's see him.

24:09.271 --> 24:10.689
Where the fuck is he?

24:10.773 --> 24:12.608
He got up and walked.

24:13.901 --> 24:16.820
After that fall, he would've
broken half his bones.

24:18.614 --> 24:21.075
I don't think he'd
have given a shit.

24:25.621 --> 24:26.955
D'Amour.

24:26.997 --> 24:29.625
Why do I know that name?

24:30.793 --> 24:32.920
I know him.

24:32.961 --> 24:35.464
I saw him on TV.

24:35.547 --> 24:38.801
Some kid got possessed, and he
saved the little bastard's life.

24:39.635 --> 24:41.470
A priest?

24:49.311 --> 24:51.772
He's just some guy...

24:51.814 --> 24:54.066
who's got a nose for this shit.

24:55.317 --> 24:57.111
Like you.

25:00.531 --> 25:02.491
I don't want him
getting in the way.

25:02.574 --> 25:04.243
He won't.

25:07.162 --> 25:09.289
We've, all of us,
waited too long...

25:09.373 --> 25:12.126
to have the homecoming spoiled.

25:14.378 --> 25:16.755
What do you mean, "all of us"?

25:16.839 --> 25:19.633
A lot of people believed in Nix.

25:19.675 --> 25:22.136
They haven't forgotten his promise.

25:24.888 --> 25:26.181
About?

25:26.265 --> 25:27.683
Death.

25:28.892 --> 25:30.352
What about death?

25:34.898 --> 25:37.234
It's an illusion.

26:03.927 --> 26:05.637
Coffee, Mrs. Swann?

26:05.721 --> 26:07.639
Yes, thank you.

26:09.767 --> 26:11.018
Where's Mr. Swann?

26:11.101 --> 26:12.686
In his study.

26:12.770 --> 26:15.230
He got something on his mind?

26:29.787 --> 26:31.705
Hey. Mr. Sunshine.

26:37.252 --> 26:39.213
That's what I'm gonna call you.

26:41.799 --> 26:43.509
Bad show?

26:48.389 --> 26:49.640
The usual.

26:49.723 --> 26:52.017
Full house.

26:52.101 --> 26:53.852
Standing ovation.

26:53.936 --> 26:55.604
I tell them it's magic.

26:55.687 --> 26:57.439
They believe you.

26:57.523 --> 26:58.941
Yeah.

27:04.446 --> 27:06.115
Remember Quaid?

27:07.908 --> 27:09.326
Sure.

27:13.205 --> 27:15.124
I think they killed him.

27:18.794 --> 27:20.087
Oh, God.

27:22.214 --> 27:24.216
I just saw him too.

27:32.808 --> 27:34.935
I'm putting in a new
illusion tonight.

27:36.478 --> 27:39.064
Something special.
I want you to be there.

27:44.194 --> 27:45.738
Of course.

27:47.156 --> 27:50.117
You want me to find
out about Quaid?

27:50.159 --> 27:52.369
- I mean, the funeral?
- No.

27:56.206 --> 27:58.250
I'm not going anywhere near him.

28:13.390 --> 28:14.767
Higher.

28:17.770 --> 28:19.146
Another inch.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.858
The left hand side is too low.

28:24.568 --> 28:25.652
Valentin?

28:28.572 --> 28:30.824
Good. There.

28:35.079 --> 28:36.622
Yes?

28:38.290 --> 28:41.210
I want you to find this
man D'Amour for me.

28:51.953 --> 28:53.914
Think any movie stars
buried around here?

28:54.915 --> 28:56.583
Probably.

28:56.666 --> 28:59.294
It's not a bad place.
It's warm, lots of palm trees.

28:59.377 --> 29:02.297
I don't think the dead much care.

29:02.380 --> 29:03.799
You sure?

29:05.509 --> 29:07.427
- Are you a believer, then?
- Oh, yeah.

29:07.511 --> 29:10.430
I signed on for all
of them in my time.

29:10.514 --> 29:13.558
Catholic, Hindu, Moonies.

29:15.185 --> 29:17.103
You can't have too many saviors.

29:22.067 --> 29:24.277
Who's that?

29:24.361 --> 29:26.655
Swann's wife.

29:35.163 --> 29:38.125
I want you to help
me help my husband.

29:38.166 --> 29:43.130
He's in some kind of trouble... something
to do with the man you saw murdered.

29:44.131 --> 29:47.551
I think Philip believes all that
stuff with the tarot cards.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.178
And you don't?

29:51.304 --> 29:53.765
I think we make our own futures.

29:56.017 --> 29:58.145
So, what's the connection?

29:58.228 --> 30:00.313
I don't exactly know.

30:00.397 --> 30:03.108
Philip doesn't like to
talk about the past.

30:03.150 --> 30:04.609
Why not?

30:09.239 --> 30:11.366
He's a secretive man.

30:13.785 --> 30:15.704
And you don't ask questions?

30:17.914 --> 30:20.834
We don't share our lives the
way a lot of people do.

30:20.917 --> 30:23.879
But obviously you
still care about him.

30:23.962 --> 30:26.882
We wouldn't be having this
conversation if I didn't.

30:29.342 --> 30:32.304
Swann is one of the most
remarkable men alive.

30:34.681 --> 30:36.308
You don't believe me?

30:37.184 --> 30:40.228
He's an illusionist.
That's not exactly brain surgery.

30:41.354 --> 30:43.273
I'm sorry. You asked.

30:46.359 --> 30:48.987
No, you're right.

30:50.530 --> 30:53.074
He could've been something more.

30:53.158 --> 30:54.618
Maybe a lot more.

30:56.161 --> 30:59.664
But sometimes people get lost.
Even good people.

30:59.748 --> 31:03.418
- Too much money, too much fame.
- Where do I sign up?

31:06.588 --> 31:08.507
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

31:09.633 --> 31:12.177
- Harry.
- Harry.

31:13.136 --> 31:15.555
When do you want me to start?

31:15.597 --> 31:18.016
Come to the show with me.

31:18.058 --> 31:20.519
It's his last performance
in L.A. tonight.

31:22.062 --> 31:25.899
I want you to see him with
an audience. They love him.

31:26.942 --> 31:28.026
Do you?

31:29.778 --> 31:32.739
I didn't marry him for
love, Mr. D'Amour.

31:33.865 --> 31:35.951
- Tonight?
- Sure.

31:37.410 --> 31:38.870
Okay.

32:31.423 --> 32:32.841
Excuse me.

32:35.093 --> 32:36.386
Sorry.

32:40.432 --> 32:42.392
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Are you kidding?

32:42.434 --> 32:44.394
This is a big deal for me.

32:45.604 --> 32:48.064
I gotta have the tux
back by midnight.

32:50.650 --> 32:51.943
Valentin!

32:56.114 --> 32:57.574
I'm here.

32:58.909 --> 33:02.454
The guy with Dorothea...
is that him?

33:12.214 --> 33:14.674
- Check if he's ready.
- Ready?

33:15.926 --> 33:17.344
Ready.

33:46.832 --> 33:49.501
How the fuck does he do that?

33:49.584 --> 33:51.086
It's wires.

33:51.169 --> 33:54.297
- I don't see no wires.
- So, what is it? Magic?

33:56.633 --> 33:58.385
Ladies and gentlemen...

33:58.468 --> 34:02.389
you are standing on the
threshold of a miracle.

35:43.657 --> 35:46.660
Come with me into the great beyond.

35:51.289 --> 35:52.707
He's good.

35:52.791 --> 35:54.709
You haven't seen anything yet.

36:21.378 --> 36:23.588
This is the new illusion.

37:15.515 --> 37:18.226
Have you seen this before?

37:28.111 --> 37:29.988
There's something wrong here.

38:23.375 --> 38:25.502
For God's sake!

38:25.585 --> 38:26.836
Wait! Who are you?

38:29.381 --> 38:30.590
Oh, God.

38:33.969 --> 38:35.053
Please.

38:38.974 --> 38:40.725
Please, Dorothea.

38:42.143 --> 38:43.562
Come away.

38:43.645 --> 38:45.230
It's no use.

39:41.119 --> 39:43.288
I got you, you fucker!

39:52.714 --> 39:54.257
Who did this, D'Amour?

39:54.341 --> 39:55.926
Who killed Swann?

39:56.760 --> 39:58.178
You did.

39:59.221 --> 40:00.931
Didn't you?

40:01.014 --> 40:02.098
Why would I?

40:02.182 --> 40:04.017
Beats me.

40:04.100 --> 40:07.020
You don't have a clue
what you're into, do you?

40:07.103 --> 40:08.313
I feel it!

40:08.355 --> 40:10.023
Deep shit?

40:14.194 --> 40:15.487
Who did this?

40:17.948 --> 40:19.366
It was...

40:20.533 --> 40:21.618
It was...

41:49.432 --> 41:51.851
And this Butterfield guy?

41:51.893 --> 41:53.019
Vanished.

41:54.312 --> 41:57.690
Another fucking magician. Jesus.

41:59.484 --> 42:01.402
You through with me?

42:03.446 --> 42:04.948
For now.

42:05.031 --> 42:07.534
You planning on moving
back to New York?

42:09.077 --> 42:10.537
No, not yet.

42:33.434 --> 42:35.395
- They treating you all right?
- Yeah.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.859
I heard what happened.

42:40.942 --> 42:43.945
I think I'm gonna stick
around for a while.

42:44.028 --> 42:46.739
Maybe dig in places
that cops wouldn't look.

42:48.032 --> 42:50.618
I wouldn't know where you'd start.

42:50.702 --> 42:52.954
Maybe with the other illusionists?

42:53.788 --> 42:55.707
They won't tell you anything.

42:56.624 --> 42:58.585
I can be very persuasive.

43:01.880 --> 43:03.131
Yeah.

43:04.591 --> 43:06.509
I think you probably can.

43:24.609 --> 43:28.571
Now, down here is what
they call the repository.

43:29.947 --> 43:31.782
Behind those locked doors...

43:31.824 --> 43:35.620
lies every secret of
magic known to mankind.

43:36.454 --> 43:38.539
- Ever been in there?
- Me? No.

43:38.623 --> 43:40.958
No, there are only three keys.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.294
Vinovich has got one, of course.

43:44.378 --> 43:46.714
It is more than entertainment.

43:46.797 --> 43:49.383
We are opening up people's heads.

43:49.467 --> 43:54.263
We are bringing miracles back
into their miserable little lives.

43:54.305 --> 43:56.307
But they're fake miracles.

43:56.390 --> 43:59.143
Houdini believed he
had spirit guides.

43:59.227 --> 44:00.645
Do you believe that?

44:00.686 --> 44:02.146
I believe...

44:02.188 --> 44:05.107
that we walk a narrow path...

44:05.149 --> 44:07.276
between...

44:07.360 --> 44:08.653
Heaven and hell?

44:08.736 --> 44:10.321
Divinity and trickery.

44:12.198 --> 44:14.450
So then, sometimes...

44:14.492 --> 44:17.119
the miracles are real.

44:17.203 --> 44:19.205
No. They are always fake.

44:19.288 --> 44:22.667
The saints, the messiahs,
they were just illusionists.

44:22.708 --> 44:24.669
You could walk on water?

44:24.752 --> 44:29.674
I can reproduce any miracle
that has ever been performed...

44:29.715 --> 44:31.509
with a little preparation.

44:32.218 --> 44:33.970
Even one of Swann's?

44:36.430 --> 44:38.850
- They were no damn good.
- Really?

44:38.933 --> 44:41.602
That's funny.
I heard he was one of the best.

44:41.686 --> 44:44.605
If he was so good,
why is he so dead?

44:46.691 --> 44:47.859
You tell me.

44:51.612 --> 44:53.781
I figured you'd have some theory.

44:53.865 --> 44:55.700
I have many theories.

44:55.741 --> 44:58.161
I'd like to hear one of them.

45:00.538 --> 45:02.456
I'm not saying another word.

45:02.540 --> 45:05.001
You damn fool, Wilder.

45:05.042 --> 45:06.794
This man is a journalist.

45:06.878 --> 45:10.548
No, I'm not a journalist.
I just wanted to know about Swann.

45:10.631 --> 45:12.675
He was a freak.

45:12.758 --> 45:15.052
Everything he did was tainted.

45:15.136 --> 45:17.471
- With what?
- Evil!

45:17.555 --> 45:20.057
He was evil.

45:22.393 --> 45:23.811
Are you coming?

45:27.398 --> 45:31.861
Do not speak to this man if
you wish to keep my company.

45:31.903 --> 45:34.155
That's a great accent.
What is it, Brooklyn?

45:34.238 --> 45:35.823
Fuck you, all right?

45:53.132 --> 45:54.550
Harry.

46:15.863 --> 46:18.032
I've got to be careful.

46:18.115 --> 46:21.828
- If Vinovich sees me talking to you...
- What do you want, Billy?

46:21.911 --> 46:23.871
I heard a name.

46:24.997 --> 46:26.916
Someone they talk
about in whispers.

46:26.999 --> 46:28.376
Who?

46:29.502 --> 46:30.753
Nix.

46:33.548 --> 46:37.093
He's dead now, but I think
maybe he taught Swann.

46:37.176 --> 46:39.345
Who's doing the talking?

46:39.428 --> 46:41.264
Vinovich.

46:41.347 --> 46:43.266
But you burned your bridges there.

46:47.562 --> 46:48.896
This is me.

46:50.231 --> 46:51.482
Good luck.

46:54.235 --> 46:56.154
I loved what you did in there.

47:01.576 --> 47:02.910
What are you looking at?

47:13.546 --> 47:17.666
I just want to know what Philip saw in
those cards and stop it from happening.

47:21.971 --> 47:23.931
Divinity and trickery.

47:29.228 --> 47:32.148
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.

47:48.254 --> 47:51.272
- D'Amour.
- Harry, I know it's late.

47:52.607 --> 47:54.025
That's okay.

47:55.652 --> 47:57.237
How'd it go today?

47:59.205 --> 48:01.999
Went up to the Magic Castle.

48:03.418 --> 48:06.838
You were right. He didn't have
a lot of friends up there.

48:06.921 --> 48:08.506
They were jealous of him.

48:09.590 --> 48:11.175
Why? Because he had you?

48:13.511 --> 48:15.930
He didn't have me. I told you.

48:15.972 --> 48:18.307
Yeah, you didn't
marry him for love.

48:18.391 --> 48:20.393
So, why did you marry him?

48:20.476 --> 48:22.437
That's none of your
business, Harry.

48:24.689 --> 48:27.733
You ever hear of
somebody called Nix?

48:31.779 --> 48:33.448
Dorothea?

48:39.203 --> 48:41.122
Yeah, I'm here.

48:42.248 --> 48:44.167
I don't know the name.

48:44.250 --> 48:46.502
What about Jennifer Desiderio?

48:47.837 --> 48:49.797
It doesn't ring a bell.

48:50.506 --> 48:51.591
I have to go.

48:51.674 --> 48:53.134
That's it?

48:54.969 --> 48:57.889
All right. Look, I'll keep digging.

48:57.972 --> 49:00.391
Yeah. You do that.

49:14.614 --> 49:17.533
"Keep Out Police Department"

49:36.719 --> 49:39.305
Ever watched a man die?

50:20.721 --> 50:22.306
Yes.

50:33.734 --> 50:35.862
"Desiderio."

50:49.167 --> 50:51.002
What are you doing here?

50:51.085 --> 50:53.004
Looking for you.

50:53.087 --> 50:56.340
- I tried the hotel.
- So why you'd come here?

50:56.424 --> 50:59.010
You're a detective with no clues.

50:59.093 --> 51:01.012
Where else would you look?

51:02.597 --> 51:04.223
Do you mind?

51:05.808 --> 51:07.268
I'll keep this brief.

51:08.644 --> 51:10.772
Here's $30,000.

51:12.440 --> 51:13.608
What for?

51:13.691 --> 51:15.276
A ticket home.

51:16.360 --> 51:20.573
You didn't hire me. She did. She wants
me to stop, I wanna hear it from her.

51:20.656 --> 51:23.534
- She doesn't want to see you.
- No?

51:23.618 --> 51:26.245
- People are dying here.
- Yes.

51:26.329 --> 51:28.998
It's a terrible tragedy.

51:29.082 --> 51:31.334
Is that all you have to say?

51:32.418 --> 51:34.504
It's a fucking terrible tragedy?

51:35.797 --> 51:38.716
- I want to know why.
- Why people die?

51:42.887 --> 51:46.307
Give it up, D'Amour. Go home.

51:49.310 --> 51:51.562
Don't try to see her, D'Amour.

51:51.646 --> 51:53.773
Just leave her alone.

51:53.856 --> 51:55.983
Lock up, will you?

51:57.610 --> 52:00.279
Jennifer has only
ever had one visitor.

52:00.363 --> 52:02.865
- Mr. Quaid?
- Right.

52:03.783 --> 52:06.577
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Yeah.

52:06.619 --> 52:08.621
Heard it on the news.

52:08.704 --> 52:10.623
Jennifer doesn't know...

52:10.706 --> 52:13.501
and frankly, this isn't the
best time for her to be told.

52:13.584 --> 52:15.294
I won't say anything.

52:16.921 --> 52:20.800
She's been with us for four years
and she was coming along nicely.

52:22.135 --> 52:24.429
Past month she's been
worst than ever.

52:24.470 --> 52:27.932
- What's her problem?
- She has no real grip on reality.

52:28.808 --> 52:31.519
- Does anybody?
- Oh, yes.

52:31.602 --> 52:35.314
We have to agree on what's real and not.
That's what holds us together.

52:36.315 --> 52:38.568
What does Jennifer think is real?

52:38.651 --> 52:40.695
She thinks the devil's
coming for her.

52:44.323 --> 52:46.242
Have we met before?

52:48.494 --> 52:50.204
Only I forget.

52:53.040 --> 52:57.128
They give me pills, you
know, to make me even.

52:57.170 --> 52:59.005
And I...

52:59.088 --> 53:00.923
I forget things.

53:01.007 --> 53:02.508
You didn't forget me.

53:05.803 --> 53:09.557
I just came to see if you
remembered a man named Butterfield.

53:13.436 --> 53:15.229
Maybe. I...

53:20.059 --> 53:23.846
That's okay.
What about Philip Swann?

53:27.633 --> 53:29.010
I knew Swann.

53:31.971 --> 53:33.431
He's a fucking liar.

53:33.514 --> 53:35.057
Why is that?

53:35.141 --> 53:37.101
He said he knew how to protect us.

53:37.977 --> 53:39.896
But he didn't know anything.

53:41.898 --> 53:44.358
He made us think it was
over and done with.

53:44.442 --> 53:46.068
What was?

53:49.522 --> 53:51.824
I don't wanna think about it.

53:51.866 --> 53:53.993
If I think about it, he'll...

53:54.076 --> 53:55.995
he'll hear me.

53:56.078 --> 53:57.830
He'll find me.

53:57.872 --> 53:59.749
Swann?

53:59.832 --> 54:01.792
I told you. I don't want...

54:09.508 --> 54:10.843
What is it?

54:10.885 --> 54:12.470
Calm down.

54:14.639 --> 54:16.140
No, he'll get me!

54:16.182 --> 54:18.518
He's not... He's not...

54:20.770 --> 54:22.522
Who's not gonna get you?

54:22.563 --> 54:24.190
Nix. Nix.

54:24.273 --> 54:26.317
- And he's the Puritan?
- Yes!

54:28.653 --> 54:30.738
- And he's dead?
- No.

54:30.821 --> 54:32.782
He's coming back.

54:32.865 --> 54:34.992
He's digging his way out.

54:35.076 --> 54:37.745
I'll take care of her now.

54:52.009 --> 54:53.594
Jesus.

55:15.819 --> 55:17.905
Billy. Harry D'Amour.

55:17.988 --> 55:19.365
Listen.

55:19.507 --> 55:23.702
Supposing I wanted to get into the
repository at the Magic Castle.

55:27.063 --> 55:28.648
There we go.

55:31.067 --> 55:33.195
You done something
like this before?

55:33.278 --> 55:34.988
I've had my moments.

55:36.406 --> 55:37.991
Hold that up.

55:41.703 --> 55:44.039
- They've gotta have this place rigged.
- How?

55:44.122 --> 55:46.041
It'll be something hokey.

56:06.711 --> 56:08.087
Whoa!

56:10.840 --> 56:12.759
Let's have a look around.

56:48.253 --> 56:51.130
Butterfield's pal had this
carved on his forehead.

56:51.214 --> 56:53.132
Any idea what it is?

56:55.093 --> 56:56.511
Nope.

57:09.524 --> 57:12.569
What'd I tell you?
So fucking hokey.

57:18.116 --> 57:19.576
What have we got here?

57:27.584 --> 57:29.586
- Get the files.
- Fuck the files.

57:29.669 --> 57:32.380
Billy, get the files!

57:34.716 --> 57:36.259
Go on!

57:44.142 --> 57:45.226
Jesus!

57:46.311 --> 57:47.854
I could have lost my fucking hands!

57:50.690 --> 57:53.151
That would have kept you
out of the magic circle...

57:53.193 --> 57:56.988
which was presumably the idea.

57:58.364 --> 58:00.116
Why don't you take a
look through these?

58:02.035 --> 58:03.494
Go on.

58:13.838 --> 58:15.256
These must be about Nix.

58:16.466 --> 58:17.675
The Puritan?

58:24.307 --> 58:25.517
Look at that.

58:25.600 --> 58:27.101
A Nix specialty?

58:29.145 --> 58:31.105
I don't know any of these tricks.

58:32.632 --> 58:34.384
Maybe they're not tricks.

58:37.720 --> 58:40.932
What did Vinovich say? Something
about walking the path between...

58:40.974 --> 58:43.226
Trickery and divinity.
He's saying that all the time.

58:43.268 --> 58:45.353
He said that because he knew.

58:45.437 --> 58:47.272
Son of a bitch.

58:47.313 --> 58:49.232
He'd seen these and he knew.

58:49.274 --> 58:50.442
Knew what?

59:21.264 --> 59:23.767
Get it off of me!
Where the fuck are you?

59:23.808 --> 59:25.560
Hold it right there.

59:26.478 --> 59:28.897
I said hold it...

59:50.335 --> 59:52.003
Hokey enough for you?

59:55.548 --> 59:57.509
I'm out of here, man.

01:00:01.513 --> 01:00:03.139
Comin'?

01:00:03.181 --> 01:00:04.641
Yeah.

01:00:05.683 --> 01:00:07.602
I'm comin'.

01:00:15.443 --> 01:00:16.945
I can't let you in.

01:00:31.876 --> 01:00:33.837
This is the way he wanted it.

01:00:36.214 --> 01:00:37.674
No autopsy...

01:00:39.217 --> 01:00:40.552
no embalming...

01:00:43.555 --> 01:00:45.640
nobody meddling with his body.

01:00:48.351 --> 01:00:50.520
"Flesh is a trap," he used to say.

01:00:51.729 --> 01:00:53.314
"Flesh is a trap...

01:00:56.025 --> 01:00:58.069
and magic sets us free."

01:01:00.989 --> 01:01:02.490
Why did you come back?

01:01:04.117 --> 01:01:06.286
I've been doing some digging.

01:01:06.369 --> 01:01:07.996
What did you find?

01:01:11.583 --> 01:01:14.419
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.

01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:19.424
She threw herself in front
of a car this afternoon.

01:01:24.304 --> 01:01:26.598
Why don't you tell me the truth?

01:01:33.271 --> 01:01:35.523
Nix ran some kind of a cult, right?

01:01:37.108 --> 01:01:40.236
Some kind of a
Charlie Manson deal?

01:01:40.278 --> 01:01:42.614
It was more than that, I think.

01:01:43.782 --> 01:01:45.742
He was the real thing, wasn't he?

01:01:45.784 --> 01:01:47.494
Swann said he could do stuff.

01:01:48.703 --> 01:01:50.413
Like?

01:01:50.455 --> 01:01:52.957
He could levitate, juggle fire...

01:01:54.292 --> 01:01:57.378
and he could get into
people's heads...

01:01:57.504 --> 01:01:59.214
make them see things.

01:01:59.297 --> 01:02:01.508
- Terrible things.
- What things?

01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:03.926
I don't know.

01:02:03.927 --> 01:02:07.972
- And he taught some of this to Swann?
- Yes, some of it.

01:02:08.098 --> 01:02:11.643
So then, Swann wasn't
performing illusions.

01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:13.269
He was doing magic.

01:02:14.062 --> 01:02:15.438
Yes.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.234
What? You thought he should
be using it to cure cancer...

01:02:19.317 --> 01:02:20.652
instead of making millions?

01:02:23.279 --> 01:02:26.116
- Look, I told you.
- Right. I know. Too much fame.

01:02:26.199 --> 01:02:29.452
That'd be enough to turn anybody's
head, including yours.

01:02:29.494 --> 01:02:30.745
Oh, fuck you.

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:33.164
You're the one who said you
weren't with him for love.

01:02:33.206 --> 01:02:34.999
I wasn't.

01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:36.584
Then what?

01:02:38.503 --> 01:02:40.755
What the hell was going on here?

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.678
- I was grateful to him.
- For what?

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:49.764
Everything I had I owed to him.

01:02:57.313 --> 01:02:58.898
And he loved me.

01:03:00.191 --> 01:03:02.694
He couldn't always show it,
but he felt it.

01:03:02.777 --> 01:03:05.280
He thought Nix was coming
back, didn't he?

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:12.036
Didn't he?

01:03:15.248 --> 01:03:17.917
I can't help you
unless you talk to me!

01:03:19.127 --> 01:03:22.046
- You can't help me.
- You don't know that!

01:04:03.476 --> 01:04:05.061
I was so afraid.

01:04:05.419 --> 01:04:07.191
Don't be.

01:04:07.234 --> 01:04:09.753
Nix can't hurt you now.

01:04:13.765 --> 01:04:15.434
I know.

01:04:17.144 --> 01:04:19.062
I was the one who shot him.

01:04:21.815 --> 01:04:23.317
I was 12.

01:04:25.026 --> 01:04:28.738
Nix took me hostage to
get Swann to come to him.

01:04:30.323 --> 01:04:31.908
And they all came.

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:35.787
- Yeah.
- Quaid and Jennifer and...

01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:37.831
Swann and Pimm.

01:04:43.169 --> 01:04:44.421
What was that?

01:04:50.051 --> 01:04:51.636
Valentin?

01:04:57.058 --> 01:04:58.643
Wait!

01:05:15.994 --> 01:05:17.245
What the hell?

01:05:28.131 --> 01:05:30.717
It's him. It's Nix.

01:05:32.052 --> 01:05:34.304
Dorothea, stay there.

01:06:50.547 --> 01:06:52.382
Find Valentin!

01:06:53.883 --> 01:06:56.678
Find him and get him in here. Now!

01:07:04.144 --> 01:07:05.478
This is sacrilege.

01:07:08.523 --> 01:07:10.609
Are you satisfied now?

01:07:13.695 --> 01:07:16.323
Don't worry. I'm not hurting him.

01:07:21.828 --> 01:07:24.456
Looks like you're not
a widow after all.

01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:31.755
Sit down.

01:07:35.967 --> 01:07:38.261
You rigged the illusion
to fail, right?

01:07:38.345 --> 01:07:39.596
Yes.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.307
You set up the fake body?

01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:46.144
And then what?

01:07:47.771 --> 01:07:51.441
Because I was getting too close
to something or someone...

01:07:51.524 --> 01:07:53.860
you called Swann?

01:07:53.902 --> 01:07:56.488
No. First I tried to pay you off.

01:07:58.531 --> 01:08:00.575
Was it Swann's idea?

01:08:02.452 --> 01:08:03.828
It was mine.

01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:06.998
I didn't want any more bloodshed.

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:10.835
That's why we went to all this trouble.
So Nix would have no one to come after.

01:08:10.919 --> 01:08:14.547
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake!
What is wrong with you people?

01:08:14.631 --> 01:08:18.051
Haven't you seen enough to
know that doesn't matter?

01:08:19.928 --> 01:08:23.430
I want to meet with
Swann face to face.

01:08:23.555 --> 01:08:27.102
Why can't you just let this alone?

01:08:27.143 --> 01:08:29.395
Let everyone think it's over.

01:08:34.024 --> 01:08:35.609
Maybe he's right.

01:08:37.237 --> 01:08:39.990
Maybe we should just
let him stay dead.

01:10:24.636 --> 01:10:26.554
Couldn't stay away, could you?

01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:36.481
Had to see who cried
over you the most, huh?

01:10:38.483 --> 01:10:40.277
You know...

01:10:40.318 --> 01:10:44.406
a lot of people are gonna be pissed off
when they find out you're still alive.

01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:53.581
And they will, you know.

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:58.795
No matter how much shit you bury
yourself under, you're gonna...

01:11:10.682 --> 01:11:13.143
You shouldn't have followed me.

01:11:14.185 --> 01:11:15.854
How do you do that?

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:18.356
Now I'm going to have to kill you.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.899
I don't think so.

01:11:20.984 --> 01:11:22.527
You need me alive.

01:11:22.652 --> 01:11:25.572
Why? So you can fuck
the woman I love?

01:11:25.697 --> 01:11:28.867
If you love her so much,
why did you widow her?

01:11:45.967 --> 01:11:47.761
What a waste.

01:11:47.844 --> 01:11:50.096
You can do shit that most
of us can only dream about.

01:11:51.556 --> 01:11:54.309
Then you go around pretending
it's just some trick.

01:11:55.101 --> 01:11:58.355
Illusionists get Las
Vegas contracts.

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:01.399
Magicians get burned.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.318
Yeah, or murdered like Nix.

01:12:03.401 --> 01:12:06.696
Oh, he deserved it.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:09.199
Maybe he doesn't feel that way.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.827
Maybe he's digging himself out of
that hole you put him in right now.

01:12:12.911 --> 01:12:14.996
That's what you're
hiding away from, isn't?

01:12:15.872 --> 01:12:17.499
I did it for Dorothea.

01:12:18.583 --> 01:12:20.043
Yeah?

01:12:22.128 --> 01:12:26.257
Now that I'm dead,
the spotlight's off her.

01:12:26.299 --> 01:12:30.011
- So Nix won't be looking for her.
- I betrayed him.

01:12:31.137 --> 01:12:35.433
But she shot him. If I'm Nix,
that'd piss me off a little bit.

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.893
I don't know what else to do.

01:12:37.894 --> 01:12:39.479
Help me.

01:12:42.148 --> 01:12:43.525
Look...

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:50.031
if Nix is back from the dead...

01:12:50.073 --> 01:12:52.533
then he is some kind of a god...

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:55.328
and he'll find you
wherever the fuck you go.

01:12:56.246 --> 01:12:59.416
But if he's just another
phony messiah...

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.753
then you can stage the
greatest comeback in history.

01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:34.075
Who's there?

01:13:41.499 --> 01:13:42.959
Easy.

01:13:52.802 --> 01:13:54.554
I've sometimes thought...

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:57.265
if I'd had another profession...

01:13:58.642 --> 01:14:00.852
I would have been a surgeon.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.109
To be able to heal
with one little cut.

01:14:15.283 --> 01:14:18.453
Say that those eyes of
yours were troubling you.

01:14:21.414 --> 01:14:23.833
- Please.
- I could just scoop them out.

01:14:25.752 --> 01:14:27.212
No, don't.

01:14:27.295 --> 01:14:29.630
Then tell me where Nix is buried.

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:32.550
I don't know.

01:14:41.685 --> 01:14:43.687
Wait! Wait!

01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:50.360
I'll tell you.

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:53.071
Oh, you'll do more than that.

01:15:16.026 --> 01:15:17.736
What is it?

01:15:26.786 --> 01:15:29.414
Did Dorothea know
where Nix was buried?

01:15:30.215 --> 01:15:31.815
No.

01:15:33.293 --> 01:15:35.128
Did Valentin?

01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:37.055
Yes.

01:15:51.402 --> 01:15:53.571
Do you like the look of these?

01:15:55.281 --> 01:15:56.908
I made them myself...

01:15:57.951 --> 01:15:59.577
to set him free.

01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:02.664
Why did you wait so long?

01:16:02.747 --> 01:16:05.917
I didn't have the skill...

01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:08.086
to resurrect him...

01:16:08.127 --> 01:16:10.296
to teach myself.

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.465
That took time.

01:16:12.549 --> 01:16:16.010
Think he'll be in a fit state
to resurrect after 13 years?

01:16:16.094 --> 01:16:18.263
If he was just a man...

01:16:19.305 --> 01:16:21.599
like me, then no...

01:16:23.393 --> 01:16:26.646
but he's not.

01:16:29.941 --> 01:16:31.734
What is he, then?

01:16:33.486 --> 01:16:35.613
Maybe he'll show you.

01:16:43.454 --> 01:16:44.873
Anything?

01:16:46.249 --> 01:16:47.709
Not yet.

01:16:58.595 --> 01:17:01.472
- If you have lied to me...
- No, I swear!

01:17:01.598 --> 01:17:04.150
This is the place
Swann told me about.

01:17:04.192 --> 01:17:06.111
- The rocks...
- Five more minutes.

01:17:07.487 --> 01:17:10.365
- Are you hearing me?
- I'm doing my best.

01:17:20.291 --> 01:17:22.210
What have you got there?

01:17:23.795 --> 01:17:25.213
Fucker!

01:17:32.971 --> 01:17:34.556
Butterfield!

01:17:39.352 --> 01:17:41.145
He's in the corner!

01:17:41.146 --> 01:17:42.939
Don't touch him.

01:17:59.706 --> 01:18:01.333
It's him.

01:18:32.947 --> 01:18:35.116
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:18:57.764 --> 01:18:59.432
Smell it.

01:19:02.435 --> 01:19:04.562
He's coming. He's coming.

01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.440
He will come.

01:19:57.615 --> 01:19:59.784
Help me!

01:20:01.119 --> 01:20:02.954
Get out of the car.

01:20:02.996 --> 01:20:05.165
Get out of the fuckin' car!

01:20:23.016 --> 01:20:24.851
He's got Dorothea.

01:20:25.685 --> 01:20:28.688
- And Nix?
- Yes.

01:20:28.772 --> 01:20:31.191
- Don't bother about me.
- Shut up!

01:20:31.274 --> 01:20:33.193
We've already lost enough lives.

01:20:33.234 --> 01:20:37.155
Please accept my
apologies, D'Amour.

01:20:37.197 --> 01:20:38.531
For what?

01:20:38.615 --> 01:20:41.618
You're going to lose one more.

01:20:48.333 --> 01:20:49.501
No!

01:20:49.542 --> 01:20:51.795
He's better off this way.

01:20:53.254 --> 01:20:55.256
Nobody's better off this way.

01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.509
You don't get it, do you?

01:21:00.887 --> 01:21:02.972
This is where we're all goin'.

01:21:19.239 --> 01:21:21.282
Do you wish him amongst us?

01:21:21.366 --> 01:21:23.243
Yes.

01:21:23.284 --> 01:21:25.370
Will you come unto
him upon your knees?

01:21:28.039 --> 01:21:29.916
Be ready.

01:21:59.112 --> 01:22:02.449
Listen.
You got everything you want.

01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:03.992
You don't need me.

01:22:04.075 --> 01:22:07.495
No, but he will,
after what you did to him.

01:22:08.455 --> 01:22:10.415
He'll want vengeance.

01:23:50.098 --> 01:23:52.100
Christ in heaven!

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.896
My lord.

01:23:56.938 --> 01:23:59.315
He's coming home.

01:24:03.778 --> 01:24:05.739
He's with us.

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:07.824
He's with us.

01:24:10.994 --> 01:24:12.662
Hold her!

01:24:46.196 --> 01:24:48.114
Open your eyes.

01:24:57.832 --> 01:24:59.417
He's with us.

01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:25.610
Where is Swann?

01:25:28.530 --> 01:25:31.116
- He's dead.
- No, he isn't.

01:25:37.038 --> 01:25:38.707
I swear.

01:25:53.054 --> 01:25:54.514
Children.

01:25:59.352 --> 01:26:02.188
Will you suffer to come unto me?

01:26:18.455 --> 01:26:19.914
Jesus.

01:26:21.666 --> 01:26:23.793
What the hell is goin' on in there?

01:26:25.003 --> 01:26:28.298
At a guess, they just
resurrected him.

01:26:32.552 --> 01:26:34.012
Fuck!

01:26:34.137 --> 01:26:38.433
I've come back to bring you
the wisdom of the grave.

01:26:39.684 --> 01:26:42.228
- Will you hear it?
- Yes.

01:26:48.818 --> 01:26:50.779
Follow me.

01:27:02.123 --> 01:27:04.876
Do I know you, child?

01:27:07.462 --> 01:27:08.922
Yes.

01:27:10.423 --> 01:27:12.634
I do, don't I?

01:27:12.717 --> 01:27:15.929
No gun this time, child?

01:27:19.474 --> 01:27:21.309
Where is Swann?

01:27:24.813 --> 01:27:26.773
I don't know where he is.

01:27:30.652 --> 01:27:32.570
He'll come.

01:27:32.654 --> 01:27:36.700
We have unfinished
business, he and I.

01:28:04.978 --> 01:28:06.688
This is where we killed him.

01:28:17.449 --> 01:28:19.743
Looks like you didn't
try hard enough.

01:28:21.161 --> 01:28:23.663
I can't go any further.

01:28:28.835 --> 01:28:32.714
Where is she, you fuck, huh?

01:28:32.756 --> 01:28:35.633
Are you ready for my wisdom?

01:28:38.553 --> 01:28:42.057
Here is my wisdom.

01:28:58.281 --> 01:29:00.075
Go! Help her!

01:29:06.331 --> 01:29:09.084
You see, I escaped
from the grave...

01:29:09.125 --> 01:29:14.005
so I have to give something
to the grave in return.

01:29:14.089 --> 01:29:16.299
Yes. Show us.

01:29:16.383 --> 01:29:18.134
Show us, Puritan.

01:29:45.996 --> 01:29:48.581
I have to give something back...

01:29:48.665 --> 01:29:51.251
so I'm giving you.

01:29:52.627 --> 01:29:54.254
What's happening?

01:30:31.624 --> 01:30:33.084
Go ahead, bleed.

01:30:33.168 --> 01:30:34.627
Bleed!

01:31:29.557 --> 01:31:30.850
What are you doing?

01:31:39.734 --> 01:31:42.946
You're not worthy.

01:31:43.029 --> 01:31:44.322
None of you.

01:31:44.406 --> 01:31:46.366
Fuck you!

01:31:47.158 --> 01:31:51.037
Only Swann is worthy.

01:31:51.913 --> 01:31:54.708
You just waited like lambs.

01:32:08.054 --> 01:32:10.557
I'm not your shepherd.

01:33:03.026 --> 01:33:04.986
You're not Swann.

01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:06.738
Who are you?

01:33:07.697 --> 01:33:10.700
Oh, I know what you want.

01:33:17.607 --> 01:33:18.792
Hold on!

01:33:20.552 --> 01:33:22.295
Nix!

01:33:24.881 --> 01:33:26.966
There you are.

01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:28.968
Come on!

01:33:29.252 --> 01:33:31.921
I've had a long time...

01:33:32.005 --> 01:33:33.715
to think about you.

01:33:34.632 --> 01:33:37.719
Where did I go wrong?

01:33:38.761 --> 01:33:40.013
And?

01:33:40.096 --> 01:33:43.391
I should have been honest
with you from the start.

01:33:43.733 --> 01:33:48.187
I wasn't born to show people
the error of their ways.

01:33:48.271 --> 01:33:50.899
I was born...

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:53.443
to murder the world.

01:33:53.484 --> 01:33:56.404
You can still help me
do that if you want.

01:33:56.446 --> 01:33:58.406
Why would I wanna do that?

01:33:58.448 --> 01:34:02.243
The lady has a new
love in her life.

01:34:02.285 --> 01:34:05.538
Your friends are all dead.

01:34:05.622 --> 01:34:08.166
No one can save you now...

01:34:08.249 --> 01:34:10.168
but me.

01:34:15.131 --> 01:34:17.592
- Come on!
- We can't leave him there!

01:34:20.261 --> 01:34:22.263
I'm not going to!

01:34:27.518 --> 01:34:29.103
Bitch!

01:34:31.064 --> 01:34:32.815
Butterfield!

01:34:32.899 --> 01:34:34.567
Will you help me?

01:34:36.194 --> 01:34:37.445
Yes.

01:34:37.529 --> 01:34:40.990
Now you know I will kill you
when we're done. I have to.

01:34:42.617 --> 01:34:44.827
- Yes.
- But until then...

01:34:44.911 --> 01:34:47.497
it'll be just the two of us...

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:49.999
the way it always was.

01:34:51.751 --> 01:34:52.585
Yes.

01:34:58.049 --> 01:34:59.342
Wait.

01:34:59.425 --> 01:35:02.929
You still feel something
for that bitch?

01:35:05.306 --> 01:35:06.349
Yes.

01:35:06.558 --> 01:35:07.767
Will...

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:12.647
you...

01:35:14.190 --> 01:35:15.525
never...

01:35:17.694 --> 01:35:20.113
learn?

01:35:35.879 --> 01:35:38.298
She's just flesh...

01:35:38.381 --> 01:35:40.300
Swannie boy!

01:35:42.093 --> 01:35:43.678
I'll show you.

01:36:07.179 --> 01:36:08.879
Dorothea?

01:36:12.117 --> 01:36:13.406
Dorothea?

01:36:16.579 --> 01:36:20.799
Where is she?
Where did she go?

01:36:21.792 --> 01:36:24.545
You've got Swann's disease.

01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:28.257
You think that with a little
courage and a little love...

01:36:28.299 --> 01:36:30.676
that it'll all be all right.

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.393
Tell me where she is and
I'll make it go away.

01:36:53.074 --> 01:36:54.075
Dig, D'Amour.

01:36:56.327 --> 01:36:57.745
Touch the darkness.

01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:01.123
It's been waiting for you.

01:37:16.264 --> 01:37:18.182
Harry, it's not real.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.310
Now listen to me.

01:37:21.394 --> 01:37:22.937
Look at me!

01:37:25.565 --> 01:37:26.941
You'll be okay.

01:37:27.024 --> 01:37:29.860
There you are, child.

01:37:31.529 --> 01:37:33.364
Come along, child.

01:38:04.854 --> 01:38:06.689
What are you seeing now?

01:38:15.156 --> 01:38:16.240
There.

01:38:46.646 --> 01:38:47.980
One...

01:38:48.064 --> 01:38:49.565
last...

01:38:50.942 --> 01:38:52.276
illusion.

01:38:55.071 --> 01:38:57.073
What's it going to be?

01:38:57.156 --> 01:39:01.077
- Fire to burn out your eyes?
- Let's go!

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.205
I'm sure Swann loved your eyes.

01:39:05.164 --> 01:39:08.751
You shouldn't have taken
him away from me.

01:39:09.961 --> 01:39:12.964
We were going to be together...

01:39:13.047 --> 01:39:15.091
when I finished with the world.

01:39:15.174 --> 01:39:17.468
We were going to keep
each other company...

01:39:17.551 --> 01:39:19.178
in the dark.

01:39:24.809 --> 01:39:27.562
But I'm on my own.

01:39:27.645 --> 01:39:30.439
We're all on our own.

01:39:31.983 --> 01:39:34.235
The grave is lonely.

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:38.239
But living is worse.

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:43.661
What the fuck are you?

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:46.747
A man who wanted to be a god...

01:39:48.416 --> 01:39:51.377
then changed his mind.

01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:54.630
I'm going to be rotten
shit from now on.

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:58.259
The car.

01:40:01.012 --> 01:40:02.972
Can you raise me up like the car?

01:40:03.014 --> 01:40:07.894
I'm going to show the world
what's waiting at the end.

01:40:07.977 --> 01:40:10.229
And I am going to make it...

01:40:11.564 --> 01:40:13.274
despair.

01:40:47.642 --> 01:40:48.851
Fucker!

01:41:16.087 --> 01:41:17.922
It's me.

01:41:54.384 --> 01:41:55.968
Is it finished?

01:41:59.347 --> 01:42:00.848
I think so.

01:42:29.252 --> 01:42:30.712
Run.

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.756
Run!

01:43:37.904 --> 01:43:40.823
And the fire said to me...

01:43:40.865 --> 01:43:42.450
said to me...

01:43:44.786 --> 01:43:46.204
Hush!

01:43:48.364 --> 01:43:52.868
You will see flesh
with a god's eyes.

01:43:55.621 --> 01:43:58.666
I was born...

01:43:58.708 --> 01:44:00.876
to murder the world.

01:44:06.966 --> 01:44:08.935
"Flesh is a trap."

01:44:09.018 --> 01:44:10.937
That's what he used to say.

01:44:12.271 --> 01:44:14.607
"Flesh is a trap...

01:44:14.691 --> 01:44:16.984
and magic sets us free."
