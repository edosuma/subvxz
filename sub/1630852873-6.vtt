00:14.800 --> 00:16.760
Do you remember the swimmer
that I spoke to?

00:16.840 --> 00:20.280
Well, I sent her over an old school photo
of Amelia. She confirmed her identity.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.000
-I know her. I've met her more than once.
-What?

00:23.080 --> 00:26.160
She's been working with Mona,
calling herself Mia.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.040
But from before all of this started?

00:29.120 --> 00:31.800
-She's been asking about the case.
-Are you kidding me?

00:31.880 --> 00:32.760
No.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.280
So she might be involved
in the Moberg killing.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.400
If she got private lessons,
she could've had a key.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.480
And Elias's story
about how he got his doesn't add up.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.600
Exactly.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.320
Maybe he got it from her.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.840
They were in the same class.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.320
What if she told him about the abuse
and he wanted to help with Moberg?

00:59.320 --> 01:00.480
Hmm.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.080
So how does Elias's death and Petterson
fit into all of this?

01:06.880 --> 01:09.320
And how are Petterson and Mia connected?

01:34.080 --> 01:36.000
Hey, what the hell happened last night?

01:36.520 --> 01:38.720
Petterson never showed up for work today.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.720
I think you need to rest, Rez.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.560
-We should talk to Osei.
-Talk to him about what?

01:53.600 --> 01:54.760
I was pissed yesterday

01:54.840 --> 01:57.480
because you let the prime suspect
slip through our fingers,

01:57.560 --> 01:59.960
-who I found, by the way!
-You told me you're not feeling well.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.040
What do you think's gonna happen
if you tell Osei?

02:02.120 --> 02:03.280
I'll lose my job.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.920
Listen, I'm just trying to help.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.120
Yeah, well, this ain't
fucking helping, Kurt,

02:07.200 --> 02:08.960
so just worry about yourself.

02:15.920 --> 02:16.840
Wallander.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.680
The wiretap's been approved.
They're setting it up now.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.640
We'll have Petterson's work phone
and his mobile.

02:31.720 --> 02:32.760
Good.

02:32.840 --> 02:33.880
About last night,

02:35.480 --> 02:36.920
tough call not to intervene.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.680
But it was the right one.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.120
Thank you, sir.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.560
Everything all right
with Detective Abd Al-Rahman?

02:46.840 --> 02:48.240
Yes. Why?

02:49.160 --> 02:52.000
Good. He can take
the first shift on the wiretap.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.120
Where are we on Sören Fager?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.960
He used an ATM a few hours ago.
Nothing since, but we're looking for him.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.160
Kurt! I got something.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.320
Petterson just called someone.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.480
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>I have it under control.</i>

03:46.560 --> 03:49.520
<i>No, no.</i>
<i>This has gone too far. I can't.</i>

03:49.600 --> 03:50.720
It's Mia Holmgren.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.360
<i>It's madness.</i>
<i>We should go to the police.</i>

03:53.440 --> 03:55.920
-<i>Don't do anything stupid.</i>
-So they know each other.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.600
<i>Doesn't matter anyway.</i>

03:58.120 --> 03:59.960
<i>Sooner or later, Sören will find me</i>

04:00.040 --> 04:01.160
<i>and kill me.</i>

04:01.240 --> 04:02.200
Sören?

04:02.280 --> 04:04.360
<i>Don't worry. I'll take care of it.</i>

04:04.880 --> 04:07.320
<i>I'm coming over.</i>
<i>Just stay where you are, okay?</i>

04:08.640 --> 04:09.680
<i>I have a plan.</i>

04:11.200 --> 04:12.400
<i>Okay.</i>

04:14.040 --> 04:15.080
Where is she?

04:25.800 --> 04:27.400
<i>I'm in position now, Rez.</i>

04:27.920 --> 04:29.280
<i>I'm pulling up now.</i>

04:39.520 --> 04:42.200
-Petterson's car is here.
-<i>Yeah. I see it.</i>

04:45.360 --> 04:46.760
They're coming out now.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.040
<i>Oh yes.</i>

05:04.360 --> 05:06.480
I'm on him. You take Mia.

05:07.000 --> 05:07.920
<i>Copy that.</i>

05:25.880 --> 05:29.240
<i>Petterson's heading out of town.</i>
<i>Do you have eyes on Mia?</i>

05:30.440 --> 05:32.600
<i>Yeah. She's pulling</i>
<i>into the parking garage</i>

05:32.680 --> 05:34.400
of TLM law firm as we speak.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.560
<i>Okay, great.</i>
<i>Sit back and wait outside.</i>

05:37.640 --> 05:38.640
<i>All right.</i>

06:44.200 --> 06:45.040
-Hey.
-<i>Hey.</i>

06:45.120 --> 06:47.920
I found the connection
between Mia Holmgren and Petterson.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.800
<i>After his discharge from the army,</i>

06:49.880 --> 06:53.760
he spent over a year and a half
in a residential psychiatric program,

06:53.840 --> 06:56.120
specializes in conditions like PTSD.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.120
<i>It was set up and funded</i>
<i>by Edwin Holmgren.</i>

06:59.200 --> 07:01.440
-Mia worked there?
-<i>No, she was on the program.</i>

07:01.520 --> 07:03.040
She was a resident too.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.680
<i>I'm on my way to talk to her.</i>
<i>Meet me at her office.</i>

07:05.760 --> 07:06.920
Rez is already there.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.920
<i>-Petterson called Mia, and they met.</i>
-What?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
<i>T<i>hen they split up.</i>
<i>He's watching her.</i></i>

07:13.680 --> 07:15.360
-I'm on Petterson.
-<i>Good.</i>

07:16.440 --> 07:18.560
All right, just keep me posted.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.480
-You can tell Rez I'm on my way.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.560
Hey, Rez.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.280
<i>Rask is joining you. Anything new?</i>

07:28.880 --> 07:30.840
No, Mia's still in the office.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.480
Oh, shit!

09:09.360 --> 09:11.080
Give me your keys.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.200
-What?
-Give me your fucking keys!

09:15.240 --> 09:16.360
Fucking jog on!

09:41.080 --> 09:42.480
-Hey, Rez.
-I found Sören.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.240
-What?
-He's heading south on 101 in a red Saab.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.640
He must've been waiting for Mia
down in the garage.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.400
<i>Hang on,</i>
<i>I'll get Rask on the line too.</i>

09:51.680 --> 09:53.280
<i>Rez is on Sören's tail.</i>

09:53.800 --> 09:56.400
-<i>Where are you exactly?</i>
-Just passing the golf club.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.600
I'm on my way.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.000
Okay.

10:01.640 --> 10:06.520
-Hold up, he's taking the exit to Arrie.
-<i>Arrie?</i>

10:06.600 --> 10:09.120
That's where I am.
Just outside the village.

10:09.200 --> 10:13.040
-<i> Okay, I'll be there soon.</i>
-Sören is coming for Petterson?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.120
Or the other way around.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.200
Hang back, Rez.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.840
All right.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.000
<i>Do you see him?</i>

10:41.120 --> 10:41.960
Yeah.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.480
Fuck!

11:21.520 --> 11:23.080
Sören's coming your way, Rez.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.720
<i>He's coming your way!</i>

11:41.200 --> 11:42.680
<i>What the hell is going on, Rez?</i>

11:43.440 --> 11:45.200
Sören just crashed the car.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.720
<i>Do you have eyes on the shooter?</i>

11:51.200 --> 11:53.640
It's Petterson, with a sniper rifle.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.800
<i>He's coming your way. Stay low.</i>

12:17.160 --> 12:18.080
<i>I see Sören!</i>

12:19.120 --> 12:20.400
I'm on Petterson.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.560
Sören!

12:22.680 --> 12:24.120
Sören! Stop!

12:29.360 --> 12:31.280
<i>I'm following Sören in the field!</i>

12:33.920 --> 12:35.160
<i>Kurt, where are you?</i>

12:36.480 --> 12:37.920
<i>I'm following Petterson.</i>

12:38.440 --> 12:41.280
<i>He's in the field, still armed,</i>
<i>looking for Sören.</i>

12:47.240 --> 12:49.120
<i>He's moving towards the tree line.</i>

12:49.200 --> 12:50.640
<i>I'm coming in from behind.</i>

13:00.120 --> 13:02.880
We'll take him from two sides.
Can you get around him?

13:02.960 --> 13:04.280
<i>I think so.</i>

13:09.600 --> 13:11.960
Rez,Petterson is changing direction.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.200
Okay, I think he's headed
towards the path.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.840
<i>Are you ready?</i>

13:29.960 --> 13:31.040
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

13:32.120 --> 13:34.480
-Rez, are you ready?

13:34.560 --> 13:36.320
-<i>I can't breathe.</i>
-What's happening?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.320
<i>Rez, he's closing in.</i>

14:24.840 --> 14:26.160
-Police!

14:29.680 --> 14:30.920
Put the gun down!

14:37.200 --> 14:38.040
Drop it.

14:57.720 --> 14:58.800
Get on the ground.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.640
Here, go.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.800
Were you hit?

15:09.680 --> 15:10.680
Hey.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.600
Rez,

15:12.600 --> 15:13.880
everything's all right.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.520
I can't breathe, Kurt.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.080
You can. I promise you. Just breathe.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.960
Detective Abd Al-Rahman
has gone home to rest for a few weeks.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.400
And as for you, Detective Rask,

15:55.200 --> 15:57.560
Internal Affairs have
completed their investigation.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.960
Their report does state
that there were flaws

16:01.040 --> 16:03.880
in the initial interrogations
of Elias and Sören Fager.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.480
But their final assessment
is that a written warning

16:09.560 --> 16:11.560
would be the appropriate consequence here.

16:11.640 --> 16:15.320
As such, it is my pleasure
to welcome you back to Major Crimes.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.360
Elias Fager's funeral is tomorrow.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.400
It will attract attention.
It might be best if you don't go.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.960
I don't have anything to hide.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.480
Okay.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.320
-As for Petterson…
-Yes?

16:34.280 --> 16:35.440
Don't hold back.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.280
<i>Find his weak spot and push.</i>

16:45.560 --> 16:47.360
That's Katja Nilsson's phone.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.920
Do you want to try and explain to me
how you got it?

16:51.520 --> 16:52.840
Found it in the street.

16:53.360 --> 16:57.480
We have footage of you talking to her
on the night Elias Fager was killed

16:57.560 --> 17:01.160
and your DNA on her clothes.
How do you explain that?

17:09.480 --> 17:11.280
Are you an angry man, Joel?

17:12.440 --> 17:16.320
You tried to join the force,
but your applications were rejected.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.760
Is this your idea of an interrogation?

17:20.480 --> 17:22.600
I spent 15 years in the army.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.320
I can teach you a few techniques,
you know, that actually work.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.560
Please.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.320
I'm not surprised.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.560
About what?

17:33.640 --> 17:35.840
That it took you so long

17:37.240 --> 17:38.200
to find me.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.680
How did you know Katja Nilsson?

17:52.080 --> 17:52.920
I didn't.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.400
She just happened to be there.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.000
So you told Katja to bring Elias with her.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.680
Did you pay her?

18:00.320 --> 18:03.040
If she'd followed my instructions,
she'd still be alive.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.640
How do you know Mia Holmgren?

18:16.840 --> 18:19.800
I don't know her.
I was just asking for directions.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.640
<i>It's okay. I have it under control.</i>

18:26.720 --> 18:29.240
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>This has gone too far. I can't.</i>

18:30.640 --> 18:33.200
<i>It's madness. We should go to the police.</i>

18:33.280 --> 18:35.160
<i>Don't do anything stupid.</i>

18:36.000 --> 18:37.920
-<i>Doesn't…</i>
She had nothing to do with this.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.400
-It was all me.
-Oh, so now you <i>do </i>know her.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.360
Is Mia your girlfriend?

18:45.560 --> 18:46.720
-No.
-No?

18:46.800 --> 18:50.080
-Then what is she to you? A friend?
-More like an acquaintance.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.680
You met her
in a support group, didn't you?

18:54.240 --> 18:56.880
Did she tell you
why the boys attacked Jörgen Moberg?

18:58.360 --> 18:59.480
Was it to help her?

19:06.760 --> 19:07.800
No comment.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.120
He's obviously lying
about their relationship.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.440
The question is,
what was Mia's involvement?

19:23.040 --> 19:24.880
Did she ask him to silence Elias?

19:24.960 --> 19:27.920
Maybe. Maybe she panicked
when Sören got out.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.200
Well, we can definitely link Petterson
to Elias and Katja.

19:32.280 --> 19:35.440
-It'll be a lot more difficult with Mia.
-If she's involved.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.120
Could've been Petterson acting on impulse.

19:38.640 --> 19:42.160
On the call,
she said she wants to talk to us.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.200
She might've felt that way in the moment.
It could have changed.

19:45.280 --> 19:49.400
Here's what we have. A recorded phone call
between Petterson and Mia and the letters.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.600
Rask, what's your take?

19:50.680 --> 19:52.760
If we bring her in
and she refuses to cooperate,

19:52.840 --> 19:54.440
we may have just blown our best chance.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.400
On the other hand, if we wait,
we give her time to prepare her story.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.920
Mia's a lawyer.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.600
Like Rask says,
we might only get one shot.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.520
Before we start,

20:08.600 --> 20:12.520
I want to let you know that we understand
the kind of pressure you must be under.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.040
We know a lot, Mia.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.280
Especially about Jörgen Moberg.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.720
I can't begin to imagine
how difficult that was for you,

20:20.800 --> 20:21.880
but we need your help now.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.320
Elias Fager. How did
you two know each other?

20:25.520 --> 20:26.920
We were in the same class.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.400
What did you mean when you wrote,

20:38.800 --> 20:40.920
"This has to remain our secret."

20:42.320 --> 20:44.360
"Thank you for saving my life"?

20:45.920 --> 20:46.800
He did.

20:49.200 --> 20:53.560
Before he showed up, my life was rubbish,
but then that thing happened and…

20:55.240 --> 20:57.680
I didn't want anyone
to know that we were together.

20:58.400 --> 21:02.240
It's important we know
exactly how involved you are in this, Mia.

21:08.960 --> 21:11.760
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>This has gone too far. I can't.</i>

21:13.280 --> 21:15.880
<i>It's madness.</i> <i>We should go to the police.</i>

21:16.720 --> 21:18.080
What's gone too far?

21:20.680 --> 21:23.000
Did you ask Joel Petterson to help you?

21:26.120 --> 21:30.040
Mia, this is your opportunity
to take back control.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.720
Joel's a friend.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.320
He's been my support.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.960
I think he was trying to help,
but he's just made it worse.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.040
Much worse.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.440
-I had no idea that he planned to--

21:53.200 --> 21:54.480
Ah, Detectives.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.960
I see you've started without me.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.680
-Are you accusing my client of anything?
-Not at all, sir.

22:01.200 --> 22:05.120
We're just talking,
getting some background on Elias Fager.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.000
I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.240
My office has done everything it can
to assist your investigation.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.440
Look. I have no problem
with my name appearing in the press--

22:13.520 --> 22:15.280
it's part of my job-- but my daughter,

22:15.920 --> 22:17.720
well, she has nothing to do with this.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.040
I don't want to see her dragged into it.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.320
Elias was just someone
she happened to be at school with.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.280
So, if you'll excuse us.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.160
Mia, please, you have a choice.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.120
Mia?

22:53.600 --> 22:54.560
What are we looking at?

22:54.640 --> 22:57.520
It's accounts for a shell company

22:57.600 --> 23:01.320
registered to a solicitor's office
in Panama City.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.880
Regular payments went out every month
to one Anton Nyberg,

23:05.960 --> 23:08.480
aka Elias Fager.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.960
They look after
50,000 companies like this.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.400
It's next to impossible to work out
the beneficial owners,

23:14.480 --> 23:17.040
but thanks to a guy I met

23:17.120 --> 23:21.720
at a digital forensic conference
in Brazil-- long story--

23:21.800 --> 23:24.720
I managed to trace this particular company

23:24.800 --> 23:28.640
back to a Mr. Edwin Holmgren.

23:31.640 --> 23:32.760
He paid Elias.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.920
You know what happened.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.880
Why did he have to die?

25:47.400 --> 25:48.720
Hey!

25:48.800 --> 25:51.800
-You stay there. Stay there.
-Sören! No! No!

25:54.600 --> 25:55.720
You stay there!

25:55.800 --> 25:56.960
Stay there!

25:59.200 --> 26:00.760
Put down the knife, Sören.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.520
He's dead because of you.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.920
-He didn't deserve to die.
-No, he didn't.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.960
Just do it. I can't take this anymore.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.640
Now put the knife down, Sören.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.600
He came to me.
He wanted to tell you the truth.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.520
I panicked. I couldn't bear the thought
of what'd happen if people found out.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.040
I never wanted him to…

26:32.120 --> 26:35.240
If I knew what was gonna happen to Elias,
I would've stopped it.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.080
What did Elias wanna tell me?

26:50.320 --> 26:51.360
I promise you.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.360
He'll never come near you again.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.160
Thank you.

27:12.080 --> 27:14.520
Elias said he could get you to come along

27:15.640 --> 27:17.400
after your fight with Moberg.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.800
The plan was to scare him.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.240
<i>I hid nearby.</i>

27:27.200 --> 27:28.480
<i>I watched you go in.</i>

27:30.320 --> 27:32.800
Elias came back maybe half an hour later.

27:33.640 --> 27:35.280
-It's all gone wrong.
-What happened?

27:35.360 --> 27:38.560
Sören was drinking. He passed out.
I can't move him. Help me.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.400
Help!

28:02.920 --> 28:03.920
No!

28:11.800 --> 28:13.520
Help me!

28:17.280 --> 28:20.600
Elias felt terrible about lying to you,
and he wanted to tell you the truth.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.480
Put the knife down, Sören.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.320
I used him.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.800
He shouldn't have died.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.480
Please.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.160
Sören.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.840
You don't wanna do this.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.760
Elias tried to save me,

28:41.680 --> 28:42.760
and he did

28:44.080 --> 28:45.400
by blaming you.

29:31.680 --> 29:32.720
Hey. Hey!

29:59.120 --> 30:00.280
I'm just curious.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.080
How can you stand it?

30:02.920 --> 30:03.960
What?

30:04.480 --> 30:07.000
Being here, knowing
that justice wasn't served.

30:09.920 --> 30:13.440
You made Elias sacrifice his own brother
to protect your daughter, didn't you?

30:14.040 --> 30:15.840
You were buying his silence.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.160
I secured the futures of three children.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.000
A 14-year-old boy
was shielded from public opinion.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.040
His 16-year-old drug-addict brother
received care in juvenile prison,

30:24.120 --> 30:27.360
was given a chance to build
a new life, a new identity, and yeah,

30:27.960 --> 30:30.120
yeah, I looked after my daughter.
Why wouldn't I?

30:30.200 --> 30:33.360
You dragged her into a lie
she would have to bear her whole life.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.080
In what way is that justice?

30:35.600 --> 30:37.960
Would justice have been served
if she'd come forward?

30:38.040 --> 30:39.720
Her life would've been destroyed.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.760
It would have been painful, yes,
but now two people are dead.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.400
Look, Amelia and Elias were children.

30:46.360 --> 30:49.040
They were not responsible
for their actions, not legally.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.720
Now, if you find that unreasonable,

30:50.800 --> 30:52.920
well, you're welcome
to try and change our laws,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.400
but until you do,
we both serve under them.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.440
That's bullshit, and you know it.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.520
The only thing you cared about
was <i>your </i>daughter and <i>your </i>name,

31:00.600 --> 31:03.320
and Sören had to serve eight years
for something Mia did.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.960
Come back to me
when you have a child, Wallander.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.320
Jörgen Moberg was a pedophile
who abused my little girl.

31:12.160 --> 31:15.600
If that man is burning in hell right now,
there is some justice in that,

31:15.680 --> 31:16.520
don't you think?

31:16.600 --> 31:17.680
And Katja Nilsson?

31:18.880 --> 31:20.160
Where is her justice?

31:44.640 --> 31:46.360
I could go for one of those.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.120
Our boy was arrested this morning.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.840
Taken straight to the airport.

32:08.920 --> 32:12.600
I've been trying to contact Mia all day,
but she's not picking up her phone.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.160
I should have known.

32:15.920 --> 32:18.120
Rich girl, fancy firm.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.320
Why would she care?

32:21.120 --> 32:22.600
Pro bono is just good PR.

32:24.000 --> 32:24.880
I'm sorry.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.600
He lied to survive,
and now he's being punished for it.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.200
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.400
You just took a hit.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.320
A technical knockout.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.320
Yeah, sometimes it's all right
to stay down for a while.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.640
You know, listening to the ref counting.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.160
Can we please stop this?

32:52.880 --> 32:54.960
Then you gotta get back in the ring, baby.

33:13.160 --> 33:16.080
Mia has formally admitted
to her part in the Moberg killing,

33:16.160 --> 33:19.840
but since she was a minor at the time,
there will be no legal consequences,

33:19.920 --> 33:23.760
and there's nothing to suggest she played
an active part in Elias's death either.

33:23.840 --> 33:27.080
As for Sören, he served time
for a crime he didn't commit.

33:27.160 --> 33:30.040
There'll be significant damages,
but he'll have a case to answer

33:30.120 --> 33:31.400
for breaking his parole.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.200
And Holmgren?

33:34.720 --> 33:36.040
There's no case there.

33:36.600 --> 33:40.480
Mia's admitting to her part in all this,
but she denies her father ever knew.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.800
Elias and Katja died because of his lies.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.160
And you found their killer.

33:45.240 --> 33:49.280
Until there's evidence against Holmgren
that holds up in a court of law,

33:49.360 --> 33:51.080
justice will have to wait.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.680
He perverted the course of justice.

33:53.760 --> 33:57.800
That's for a court to decide.
You followed protocol and got the killer.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.120
That reflects well on the entire unit.

34:01.000 --> 34:01.840
Thank you.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.320
Uh, Sam.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.640
I just realized I didn't say thank you.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.000
I know you put in a good word
for me with IA.

34:27.680 --> 34:28.520
Wait.

34:31.680 --> 34:32.600
Close the door.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.080
I've gotta be honest…

34:42.200 --> 34:43.840
I really didn't think it'd be a problem,

34:45.040 --> 34:46.120
coming down here,

34:47.080 --> 34:48.200
this.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.760
But after what you said the other day I--

34:52.840 --> 34:55.880
Oh, look, I'm really sorry.
I was very emotional.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.880
-It was deeply inappropriate. I apologize.
-What happened?

34:59.800 --> 35:02.040
Just shut me out, disappeared.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.520
I spent years putting it behind me.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.400
I tried not to say anything,
but I couldn't help it.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.840
I'm sorry. I know it's unfair.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.800
But I suppose I wanted you to know
that you didn't do anything wrong.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.160
And that it wasn't your fault.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.880
And that I really loved you.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.000
And what do you feel now?

35:44.520 --> 35:45.360
I…

35:50.840 --> 35:52.040
You should get that.

36:01.880 --> 36:02.880
<i>Iyawo!</i>

36:39.240 --> 36:41.560
<i>This is News 24/7. How can I help you?</i>

36:44.120 --> 36:47.960
<i>Attorney General Edwin Holmgren</i>
<i>has today resigned from his post.</i>

36:49.400 --> 36:50.480
<i>I'm sorry. No comment.</i>

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
<i>Holmgren's daughter has been</i>
<i>linked to the murder of Jörgen Moberg.</i>

36:54.080 --> 36:56.280
<i>And it was an anonymous source</i>
<i>that gave information</i>

36:56.360 --> 37:00.080
<i>that Holmgren represented the Fager boys</i>
<i>to conceal the truth.</i>

37:00.600 --> 37:05.280
<i>The source also claimed that Holmgren</i>
<i>continued to pay Elias Fager to keep quiet</i>

37:05.360 --> 37:06.320
<i>years after.</i>

37:10.440 --> 37:11.480
-Hey.
Hey.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.720
-Hey. How're you doing?
-Very good, ma'am.

37:13.800 --> 37:17.080
All right. I'm gonna meet you there.
Don't be too long.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.760
Welcome back.

37:21.560 --> 37:24.480
So, Mia confessed, huh?

37:24.560 --> 37:25.400
Yeah.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.680
We'll likely never know
how deeply she was involved.

37:27.760 --> 37:28.680
Yeah.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.320
Is Rask okay?

37:31.760 --> 37:32.720
Are you okay?

37:32.800 --> 37:34.200
I feel great, man.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.320
I'm rested. I've been exercising again.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.120
I feel really good, man.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.560
Thank you.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.440
For what?

37:47.160 --> 37:48.280
For having my back.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.920
Otherwise, I wouldn't still be here.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.440
So come on, man. Bring it in.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.560
-Good to have you here.
-It's good to be back.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.280
Good to be here.
