[ Thunder Rumbling ]

01:39.033 --> 01:42.900
- Where are you?
- Andrew, why aren't you in bed?

01:42.900 --> 01:45.600
[ Shivering ]
I was just going, Mama.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.433
Mm-hmm.
That's a likely story.

01:47.433 --> 01:50.100
You were looking for that
ghost again, weren't you?

01:50.100 --> 01:52.167
No, I wasn't, Mama.
Honest.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.867
I don't know why you
believe in those stories.

01:55.867 --> 01:59.133
There is no ghost in this house.

Now go to bed.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.333
I will, Mama.

02:03.333 --> 02:06.067
I promise.
Good night, Mama.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.500
And then what happened?
What did the ghost do?

02:51.000 --> 02:56.800
The ghost pulled Andrew's head off
and hid it somewhere in the house.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.300
And every night since then,

02:58.300 --> 03:02.567
Andrew's ghost wanders
these halls searching...

03:02.567 --> 03:05.000
- for his head.
-  For his head.

03:05.633 --> 03:08.900
It's just a story.
It's all part of the tour.

03:08.900 --> 03:12.400
And now, if you would all follow me,
we will view the rest of the house.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.333
One of these days,
you local kids will realize...

03:35.833 --> 03:39.833
that the spirits who haunt this
house do not appreciate pranks.

Out with you now, and don't
come back until you're willing...

03:42.833 --> 03:46.333
to show Hill House
the proper respect.

03:47.833 --> 03:50.833
[ Laughing ]

03:51.333 --> 03:55.333
That was excellent! Did you see
the look on that little girl's face?

03:55.333 --> 03:56.833
We went too far that time.
She was really scared.

03:56.833 --> 04:01.333
That's the point, Duane. The twin
terrors of Wheeler Falls strike again.

04:01.833 --> 04:02.333
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

04:02.833 --> 04:05.333
Maybe we're getting too old
for this twin terror stuff.

Are you nuts?
We're just getting good.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.567

I know.

04:09.567 --> 04:12.500
Let's come back tomorrow night.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.500
We can sneak away from the tour

04:14.500 --> 04:17.132
and look for the head
of the headless ghost.

04:19.632 --> 04:21.166
- I don't know.
- What?

04:21.666 --> 04:23.400
All of a sudden,
you're afraid of ghosts?

04:23.400 --> 04:26.400
You heard what Otto said.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.500
- The-The ghosts don't appreciate--
- You believe that?

04:29.500 --> 04:32.033

Well--

04:37.133 --> 04:39.467
- Are you scared?
- No!

04:39.467 --> 04:43.967
It'll be great. Tomorrow night,
Hill House will definitely be haunted...

04:43.967 --> 04:46.133
by us.
[ Laughing Hysterically ]

04:53.433 --> 04:58.933
The history of this house
is one of madness and despair.

04:58.933 --> 05:02.167
'Twas over 150 years ago...

05:02.167 --> 05:06.667
that a sea captain
built this house...

05:06.667 --> 05:09.167
for his lady love.

05:09.167 --> 05:11.167
When he came back
from a sea voyage,

05:11.167 --> 05:15.167
he found his beloved
had left him for another man.

05:15.167 --> 05:17.667
The poor captain died
of a broken heart,

05:18.167 --> 05:23.167
but his enraged spirit lived on,
taking revenge upon anyone...

05:23.167 --> 05:25.167
who dared live in this house,

05:25.167 --> 05:29.167
and upon anyone who mocked...

05:29.167 --> 05:31.667
the ghosts within.

05:31.667 --> 05:34.667
Well, I'm glad
to see our regulars...

05:34.667 --> 05:37.667
have decided to behave
themselves tonight...

05:39.667 --> 05:41.567
for their own sake.

05:46.233 --> 05:50.233
Each of these portraits
represents some poor soul...

05:50.233 --> 05:52.233
who tried to live in this house,

05:52.233 --> 05:55.233
and then died
a horrible and grisly death.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.733
And now, if you will follow
me up to the guest room,

05:58.233 --> 06:01.000
you will hear the bloody story
of a young lad named Andrew.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.900

- Come on.
- [ Boy ] What did the ghost do?

It was used to bring
food up from the kitchen.

- No.

who loved to eat ice cream.

- [ Ringing ]
- Strawberry ice cream.

12:17.900 --> 12:21.900
Ice cream. Ice cream.
He always wanted ice cream.

And he kept the kitchen maid
hopping with his demands.

get enough ice cream.

he reached too far.

I mean, it gets allergies.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.133
It's not that good at math.

16:11.133 --> 16:14.200
Its-Its hair never does
what you want it to.

16:14.633 --> 16:18.467
Nice try, Duane. But it's no use.
I'm gonna take your head.

16:18.467 --> 16:20.633
That's all there is to it.

16:20.633 --> 16:23.200
Just hold still.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.033
Hey, the dumbwaiter!

16:26.033 --> 16:29.967
What were you expecting,
a dish of ice cream?

16:29.967 --> 16:33.467
Your head!
Now you don't have to take mine.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.733
Hey, over here!

17:00.400 --> 17:04.099
[ Grunting, Groaning ]

17:07.500 --> 17:10.067
Ow! Oh!

17:10.067 --> 17:14.433
Clumsy fool!
It's a head, not a bowling ball!

17:15.767 --> 17:19.300
Easy! Easy!
[ Groaning ]

17:19.300 --> 17:22.467
What are you looking at?

17:22.467 --> 17:26.300
- Who, me?
- Don't play innocent with me, girlie girl,

17:26.300 --> 17:29.800
or you'll find out that
my bite is worse than my bark!

17:42.267 --> 17:44.700
Whoa.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.633
Wait a minute!

17:46.633 --> 17:48.933
If you're not Andrew,

17:48.933 --> 17:50.933
then... who are you?

17:50.933 --> 17:54.333
I will tell you who he is.

17:54.333 --> 17:58.333
He is a no-good kid who works for me.

17:58.833 --> 18:03.833
Or, at least, he used to. I have
warned you about these pranks.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.333
I shall deal with you later.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.833
How did you get inside?
The door's locked.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.833
There are many ways to get
into a room in the Hill House.

18:12.833 --> 18:16.333
But sometimes,
there is no way to get out.

18:17.333 --> 18:20.333
Would you please leave us, Duane?

18:20.333 --> 18:23.833
I would like to have
a few words with Stephanie.

18:23.833 --> 18:26.333
Don't look so scared, Duane.

18:26.333 --> 18:29.333
What's he gonna do, lecture me?

18:37.667 --> 18:41.700
- [ Gasps ]
- Now, my cocky little friend--

18:42.567 --> 18:43.900
What are you doing, Otto?

18:43.900 --> 18:47.200
That's Captain Otto to you.

18:49.133 --> 18:50.867
Welcome aboard.

18:52.500 --> 18:56.333
Yes.
Welcome aboard, Stephanie.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.600
I hope you like the story I told yo--

18:58.600 --> 19:00.867
about how I died.

19:00.867 --> 19:04.100
You-- You're the ice cream boy?

19:04.100 --> 19:08.133
That's him, all right. And you think
he ever gives me a bite? Never!

19:08.600 --> 19:11.033
I warned you, Stephanie.
I warned you...

19:11.033 --> 19:15.533
to show some respect for Hill House!

19:15.533 --> 19:18.133
[ Shivering ]

19:22.633 --> 19:25.500
[ Stephanie Screaming ]

19:28.800 --> 19:30.800
I suppose when you become
a permanent member

19:30.800 --> 19:34.200
of our little household you'll learn.

19:36.400 --> 19:40.100
- You think she'll learn?
- [ Seth ] She'll learn.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.333
[ Chuckles ]
She'll learn.

19:42.333 --> 19:45.500
Please. I didn't mean it.

19:48.500 --> 19:52.533
Just another little dab
around the mouth. [ Chuckles ]

19:53.033 --> 19:54.600
Duane, help me!

20:07.567 --> 20:09.133
- Come on! Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:09.133 --> 20:11.867
- [ Shouting ]
- Run!

20:20.867 --> 20:23.233
[ Shouting Continues ]

20:47.567 --> 20:50.567
It's just the fixer-upper
we've been looking for.

20:51.567 --> 20:54.567
We understand they used
to give tours here.

20:54.567 --> 20:56.567
We heard the place was haunted.

20:56.567 --> 21:01.067
[ Chuckling ]
Haunted. Right. And I'm a ghost.

21:01.067 --> 21:04.400
Don't worry. I'm sure
you'll be very happy here.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.333
Very happy.

21:13.833 --> 21:16.300
