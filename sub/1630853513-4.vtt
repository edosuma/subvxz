20:17.262 --> 20:20.365
No. They were Nazi spies.

20:24.745 --> 20:27.498
Oh, my God, that was so close.

20:27.523 --> 20:29.525
Close? She caught us.

20:29.550 --> 20:31.176
And you kissed me. Why did you kiss me?

20:31.201 --> 20:33.376
Uh, why else would two people
be in a closet together?

we'd be in trouble. Okay?

at the time, to be love for country.

True patriotism.

22:22.367 --> 22:25.324
So, when Charlie told me she had
stole classified documents,

22:25.349 --> 22:26.767
I reported her.

22:26.792 --> 22:28.317
I thought I was doing the right thing,

22:28.342 --> 22:30.215

22:54.849 --> 22:57.688
A private securities firm, most likely.

22:59.239 --> 23:01.033
You know that I met her?

23:01.690 --> 23:04.451
She was working on this
genetic sequencing project

23:04.476 --> 23:06.432
that had the potential to save lives

23:07.428 --> 23:09.513
but also destroy them.

23:09.645 --> 23:11.105
And, uh,

23:11.145 --> 23:12.623
there were some people out there

23:12.648 --> 23:14.147
who saw applications for her research

23:14.172 --> 23:16.447
that went beyond her intentions.

23:21.649 --> 23:24.340
She was doing research that
could help save lives,

23:24.494 --> 23:27.009
and people wanted to use
it to create a bioweapon.

23:27.088 --> 23:29.758
Well, yeah, she created this
pathogen that could seek out

23:29.783 --> 23:31.951
and dismantle specific
genetic sequences.

23:32.019 --> 23:33.829

23:33.854 --> 23:36.186

23:49.788 --> 23:51.591
If her work fell into the wrong hands,

23:51.616 --> 23:53.892
it could quietly wipe out
entire groups of people

23:53.917 --> 23:56.154
because they share certain genetic code,

23:56.341 --> 23:59.542
while their neighbors go
about living their lives.

24:00.657 --> 24:02.921

her pathogen, at one time.

I can't even remember the
last thing that I said

to him before I died. It was
probably something awful.

24:26.102 --> 24:28.581
But why your dad? Honestly,
he's kind of awesome.

24:28.606 --> 24:30.484

then, all of a sudden,

in over me, and I have all

me that I'm worthless.

24:40.359 --> 24:41.962

me paint on the walls.
