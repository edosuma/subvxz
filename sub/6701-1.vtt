00:39.873 --> 00:41.602
Sequels.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.106
It's the only time I gave in in my life.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.339
But sometimes,
you gotta do it the studio way.

00:47.414 --> 00:48.711
What are you talking about?

00:48.782 --> 00:49.908
<i>- Get Lost?
- Yeah.</i>

00:49.983 --> 00:51.245
I thought the first one
was pretty good.

00:51.317 --> 00:54.150
<i>- Get Leo?
- Terrific picture. Terrific!</i>

00:54.220 --> 00:55.619
And you know what else?

00:55.688 --> 00:56.677
It was good.

00:56.756 --> 00:58.314
You know what I'm thinking, Tommy?

00:58.391 --> 01:00.552
I'm thinking of getting out
of the movie business.

01:00.627 --> 01:02.390
Go back to my old job.

01:02.462 --> 01:03.622
- What, being a shylock?
- Yeah.

01:03.696 --> 01:04.788
Why?

01:04.864 --> 01:06.263
'Cause at least they're honest
about being dishonest.

01:06.332 --> 01:09.096
Come on. Why would you
wanna leave all this?

01:09.702 --> 01:10.964
Hello!

01:12.705 --> 01:14.536
See? I'm telling you, this town.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.440
Look, Chil.

01:16.509 --> 01:20.502
You and me, we come out
to Hollywood, sniff the air,

01:20.580 --> 01:21.604
and now look at us, man.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.581
We made it!
And you know why?

01:23.650 --> 01:25.618
'Cause we knew how to hustle a deal.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.279
Yeah, like I got hustled
into doing the sequel.

01:28.855 --> 01:30.322
That sucks.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.620
Do you know that unless
you're willing to use the R rating,

01:32.692 --> 01:34.523
you can only say the F-word once?

01:34.594 --> 01:35.891
- You're kiddin' me.
- No.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.021
You know what I say?
Fuck that.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.258
I'm done.

01:39.966 --> 01:41.866
Before you skate out of the business,

01:41.935 --> 01:43.630
I got a movie for you.

01:43.703 --> 01:45.034
Oh, yeah? What?

01:45.105 --> 01:47.335
About NTL.

01:47.407 --> 01:48.999
What's NTL?

01:50.210 --> 01:52.007
"What's NTL?"
What, are you joking?

01:52.078 --> 01:53.807
- No.
- You're pulling my chain.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.848
Nothing To Lose Records.
Hello. Come on.

01:55.915 --> 01:58.315
<i>It's, like, the indie label.</i>

01:58.384 --> 02:01.717
I sign bands, I produce their albums,
I sell the distribution to the majors.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.723
- Now you wanna make movies?
- Yeah! Who doesn't?

02:04.791 --> 02:07.123
All right, can you pitch it
in 25 words or less?

02:07.193 --> 02:09.491
I can do it in one word... Me!

02:09.562 --> 02:12.190
- You?
- Me! Hello! Me!

02:12.265 --> 02:13.857
I couldn't get your mother
to watch that movie.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.128
My life in the music business.

02:16.202 --> 02:19.933
Come on! Gangsta rappers,
the Russian mafia, you know?

02:20.006 --> 02:21.530
All that goddamn payola crap.

02:21.608 --> 02:23.803
This place is
like the wild, wild west, man.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.674
You're dodgin' the bullets,
you're taking the arrows.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.940
And it's got a girl.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.675
There always is.

02:29.749 --> 02:30.841
Her name's Linda Moon.

02:30.917 --> 02:33.078
She plays a girl who wants to
make it big in the biz,

02:33.153 --> 02:36.088
and I am the record mogul
who makes it happen.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.214
Anyway, it's a musical,

02:37.290 --> 02:39.281
and Linda's been trying to get me
on the two-way ever since,

02:39.359 --> 02:41.327
<i>you know, she saw you
on Charlie Rose,</i>

02:41.394 --> 02:44.420
where you were very smooth,
and found out that I knew you.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.987
I said you would help her out,

02:46.065 --> 02:48.863
and she left you on the list
at the Viper Room

02:48.935 --> 02:50.425
expecting you to show up.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.665
So, Tommy, how's your wife?

02:52.739 --> 02:53.728
- Edie?
- Yeah.

02:53.806 --> 02:54.795
Who gives a shit?

02:54.874 --> 02:56.102
Don't be a buzzkill.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.141
Where are you goin'?

02:59.212 --> 03:01.703
I gotta go to the men's.
I just had two iced teas.

03:01.781 --> 03:04.113
But how about... Hey, Chili,
how does the movie sound?

03:04.184 --> 03:05.583
Well, you don't have a movie yet.

03:05.652 --> 03:09.179
You've got a premise and a setting,
but you don't have character arcs or a plot.

03:09.255 --> 03:12.019
Okay, but still. You know.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.355
Hey, who's gonna play me?
Think about that.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.190
How about Carrot Top?

03:30.810 --> 03:32.300
<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

04:36.042 --> 04:38.010
Hey, Marla.
Long time no see.

04:38.077 --> 04:39.203
Yeah.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.576
How's organized crime treatin' ya?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.080
A little more exciting now
that you're in town.

04:42.148 --> 04:43.172
Oh, yeah?

04:43.249 --> 04:46.241
So, Mr. Palmer, we've got reason
to believe that this was a mob hit.

04:46.319 --> 04:50.449
Trust me, if this were a mob hit, they'd
have hired a man who knew how to shoot.

04:51.324 --> 04:52.484
He hit him in the chest.

04:52.558 --> 04:53.718
Finally.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.226
After he shot up my Caddy.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.284
What a shame.

04:56.362 --> 04:59.229
Can you confirm that this fella was
wearing a toupee?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.029
Stevie Wonder could confirm
that he was wearing a toupee.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.498
So out of the blue, this Mr. Athens
just decides to look up your number

05:05.571 --> 05:06.799
and give you a call?

05:06.873 --> 05:07.999
I know what you're gettin' at, Marla.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.405
You think I set him up.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.239
The truth is Tommy wanted me
to do a movie about him.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.711
But you can't do a movie

05:13.780 --> 05:16.772
where the main character gets popped
in the first scene, now, can you?

05:17.283 --> 05:19.444
Yeah. It's not a bad opening.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.388
<i>You know, you're right.
That worked for American Beauty.</i>

05:24.123 --> 05:25.522
<i>Sunset Boulevard.</i>

05:25.591 --> 05:26.819
<i>Or Casino.</i>

05:28.928 --> 05:29.986
Mr. Palmer.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.258
I'm Glenn from Thrifty Executive Fleet.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.300
May I escort you to your vehicle?

05:34.367 --> 05:35.595
But of course.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.726
Marla.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.270
Detective.

05:46.112 --> 05:47.773
There you go, sir.

05:50.316 --> 05:51.442
What's that?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.516
I asked for a Cadillac.

05:53.586 --> 05:56.680
The Insight is the Cadillac
of gas-electric hybrid cars.

05:56.756 --> 06:00.692
Not only is it fuel-efficient,
it's great for the environment.

06:27.186 --> 06:29.450
- I got it.
- Thanks.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.586
- Hey, Martin.
- Chili!

06:33.659 --> 06:35.251
- How are you doin'?
- How are you doin', Chil?

06:35.328 --> 06:36.693
- Good to see you, Martin.
- Good to see you.

06:36.763 --> 06:37.855
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

06:37.930 --> 06:38.954
You know Hy Gordon?

06:39.031 --> 06:40.623
What's up, Chili Palmer?

06:40.867 --> 06:42.300
<i>He did the soundtrack for Get Lost.</i>

06:42.368 --> 06:44.632
What's up, man?

06:44.704 --> 06:45.728
Sorry.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.239
Hy's taking me around.
I'm doing a little research.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.832
For my next part.
I'm gonna play Johnny.

06:52.311 --> 06:55.007
The Man In Black.
Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.514
- Oh, Johnny Cash.
- Yeah!

06:56.582 --> 06:59.278
- But he's like six-feet-something.
- That's okay.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.411
You don't... You know, low angles.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.455
You know, the movies?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.054
Hey, Chili, is that your car?

07:06.125 --> 07:09.390
Yeah, it's an Insight.
It's the Cadillac of hybrids.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.692
It's a little tight for a big guy like you.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.096
Small price to pay
for the environment.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.294
Fifty-seven miles to the gallon.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.802
But what about speed?

07:17.870 --> 07:19.064
No, Martin.

07:19.138 --> 07:21.299
If you're important, people will wait.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.363
Just one shot, Marty.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.376
Marty, one smile for me, come on.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.810
My love, yeah

07:26.879 --> 07:30.280
You've got the best of my love

07:30.349 --> 07:33.807
Demonstrated love and affection

07:33.886 --> 07:38.619
That you give so openly, yeah

07:38.691 --> 07:42.718
The way I feel about you, babe,
I can't explain it

07:42.795 --> 07:46.629
Want the whole wide world
to see that

07:46.699 --> 07:49.668
Oh, but in my heart

07:49.735 --> 07:51.498
You're all I need

07:52.171 --> 07:56.039
You for me and me for you

07:58.344 --> 08:01.313
It's growing every day

08:12.525 --> 08:15.858
You've got the best of me, yeah

08:15.928 --> 08:18.294
You've got the best of my love

08:18.364 --> 08:20.628
You got me, yeah

08:20.700 --> 08:23.863
Givin' you the best of my love

08:24.403 --> 08:26.997
You've got the best of my love

08:29.609 --> 08:32.476
Givin' you the best of my love

08:32.879 --> 08:36.144
You've got the best of my love

08:50.296 --> 08:51.593
That's true.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.495
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's what it's about.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.659
You have to let it go halfway.
You can't be always tryin' so damn hard.

08:55.735 --> 08:57.202
- Linda.
- Yo!

08:57.270 --> 08:58.931
- Yo, I ain't sellin' that.
- Raji, no, I...

08:59.005 --> 09:01.565
That ain't sexy. You better go
put your chick shit back on.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.472
I can't put that on right now.
I have a meeting.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.874
I'm telling you, there's people out here
paid to come see this shit.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.036
Give me one second.

09:09.448 --> 09:11.143
Baby, I just told you
to put your clothes on, didn't I?

09:11.217 --> 09:12.912
- I can't!
- Did I not tell you that?

09:12.985 --> 09:15.476
- Look!
- Don't "look" me again!

09:19.392 --> 09:21.656
- Mr. Palmer?
- Call me Chili.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.389
- It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
- Thank you.

09:24.463 --> 09:25.760
Please, have a seat.

09:26.365 --> 09:29.357
- Can I get you something to drink?
- I have something coming.

09:30.102 --> 09:33.663
- So, Tommy's gone?
- Yeah.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.705
I can't believe it.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.473
I guess this means
you're not doing the movie?

09:39.545 --> 09:41.137
Well, I gotta be honest
with you, Linda.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.181
I'm getting out of the movie business.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.341
Here you go.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.517
What's the matter?

09:50.289 --> 09:52.416
I'm tired of this, Mr. Palmer.

09:52.491 --> 09:53.856
Look, if I can get some cash,

09:53.926 --> 09:58.090
I would buy my way out of my contract
and get out of music.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.724
Are you kidding?
After what I just saw?

10:00.800 --> 10:03.428
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause it sucks.

10:03.502 --> 10:07.370
Look, I could do the same thing topless
and make $2,000 a week with tips.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.737
Well, why don't you do that?

10:08.808 --> 10:11.606
I'm Baptist.
My father wouldn't approve.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.702
So then you're like Aretha Franklin.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.838
You learned to sing in church.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.650
I learned from my father.

10:18.718 --> 10:21.516
My dad was in a jazz band.
Nothing big, though.

10:22.321 --> 10:26.690
See, everything I know about music
I learned from him.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.525
I always thought we'd play together,
but then...

10:31.497 --> 10:33.362
...then he died, so...

10:34.333 --> 10:36.528
Yo, Linda! Yo!

10:36.602 --> 10:38.194
I didn't dismiss you.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.862
You're on my time.

10:40.673 --> 10:43.506
That's my manager Raji
with Miss Bangkok.

10:46.278 --> 10:47.575
I told him I want to quit

10:47.647 --> 10:50.741
and he's, like, "You quit me, girl,
I'm gonna jack you up".

10:54.887 --> 10:56.013
He talks like that?

10:56.088 --> 10:59.819
He thinks he's black.
His real name is Roger Lowenthal.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.325
He's partners with this guy
named Nick Carr.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.226
He's this music promoter?

11:05.464 --> 11:06.453
I know Nicky.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.762
They caught me
straight off the bus from Texas.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.361
Said they'd make me this big star
and like a fool, I believed 'em.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.405
When you done turnin' tricks,

11:15.474 --> 11:17.135
get your ass back over here!

11:17.209 --> 11:18.904
I ain't done with you yet!

11:21.514 --> 11:23.607
Look, I can't do five more years.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.674
Not with these guys.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.582
Who's the big guy?

11:27.653 --> 11:30.213
That's Elliot Wilhelm,
Raji's bodyguard.

11:30.289 --> 11:33.122
He's got this thing
that he can raise one eyebrow,

11:33.192 --> 11:34.557
give you that look.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.851
He wants to be in movies.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.293
What, that's it?
He just does the one eyebrow?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.356
As far as I know, he's gay, too.

11:42.535 --> 11:46.835
Word is he once threw a guy out of
a 30-story building for calling him a fag.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.169
Well, he must've been mad.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.642
Maybe if you didn't blow
all your energy bangin' tourists,

11:52.712 --> 11:54.737
your voice wouldn't sound so flat.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.278
Talkin' about a flat voice,
you know what I'm sayin'?

12:02.621 --> 12:04.782
Yeah, that one was for me,
so you just relax.

12:04.857 --> 12:07.621
You're gonna end up doing
fifty-cent lap dances at the First King

12:07.693 --> 12:09.024
like Miss Bangkok.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.426
Chil, wait.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.021
You don't know these guys.
They're bad guys.

12:13.099 --> 12:15.431
Trust me, Linda, I know 'em
a whole lot better than you do.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.867
...doin' some ass-poppin'
all up and down a pole.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.235
You'd be up in that place
goin' pop, pop, pop.

12:20.306 --> 12:21.295
Pop, pop, pop.

12:21.373 --> 12:22.431
What are you gonna say?

12:22.508 --> 12:25.238
Nothing more than I have to, if that.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.573
Ass-poppin'.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.340
Snap, crackle, pop!

12:29.148 --> 12:30.581
Chili, wait.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.149
Man in the suit.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.156
You in town
for some kind of convention?

12:39.525 --> 12:42.790
No, but if I was,
you'd be the man to see, am I right?

12:43.763 --> 12:46.163
Why would you say
somethin' stupid like that?

12:46.232 --> 12:49.793
The way you're dressed,
you're either a pimp or a limo driver.

12:51.470 --> 12:52.630
We've got jokes?

12:53.506 --> 12:55.269
You some kind of weak-ass comedian?

12:55.341 --> 12:57.275
Raji, look at me.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.401
I'm lookin' at you, man.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.640
You say you're looking at me,
but are you really looking at me?

13:04.483 --> 13:06.474
I'm really lookin' at you.

13:06.552 --> 13:07.849
You got somethin' stupid to say?

13:07.920 --> 13:10.388
Say it, so I can be done with you.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.445
Linda's quit.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.549
- She's out of the Chicks.
- Man, miss me with that.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.321
She's got five years left
on her contract.

13:15.394 --> 13:16.588
Well, I just cancelled it.

13:16.662 --> 13:18.425
You come walkin' out of the dark.

13:18.497 --> 13:19.930
Who you supposed to be?

13:20.599 --> 13:22.191
I'm the one settin' you straight.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.997
I'm Linda's new manager.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.331
Come on, honey.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.273
- Elliot, light his ass up.
- Got it.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.532
You're Elliot Wilhelm, aren't you?
You're an actor.

13:32.678 --> 13:33.736
Yeah.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.337
I'm sorry. Chili Palmer.

13:35.414 --> 13:36.403
I'm a producer.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.915
<i>I did the film Get Leo.
Do you remember?</i>

13:37.983 --> 13:39.974
Sure, yeah.
It's great to meet you.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.849
You know, I walk into a club,
and I see a guy like you,

13:41.921 --> 13:44.685
and I say, "He's got the look.
But does he have the talent?

13:44.757 --> 13:46.088
Can he act?"

13:47.326 --> 13:48.452
Watch this.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.333
Elliot! Elliot!

13:56.569 --> 13:57.831
Goddamn, what you doin', man?

13:57.903 --> 13:58.927
What?

14:03.275 --> 14:04.742
Breathe. Up. Up.

14:04.810 --> 14:05.936
You okay?

14:06.011 --> 14:07.342
Yeah.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.710
You can do better than him.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.409
Why don't you send me
some pictures, I'll give you a call,

14:11.483 --> 14:12.950
set you up for an audition.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.952
All right, I'm in the Will Smith building.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.587
Linda, you better talk to me.

14:17.656 --> 14:18.884
Good day.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.289
It's like that, huh?

14:20.359 --> 14:21.519
Okay.

14:22.561 --> 14:23.755
Okay!

14:27.666 --> 14:29.190
I got an audition, Raj.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.133
I need to get my headshots.

14:55.761 --> 14:56.853
Edie?

15:35.534 --> 15:37.661
Chili? Is that you?

15:37.736 --> 15:38.828
Yeah.

15:38.904 --> 15:39.893
Man!

15:41.507 --> 15:42.735
So glad you came.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.777
Well, I'm sorry,
and if there's anything I can do...

15:46.612 --> 15:47.636
Thanks.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.839
So, how are you doing?

15:52.818 --> 15:54.752
You know.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.188
You were right there
when it happened, weren't you?

15:59.258 --> 16:00.782
Well, I was in the men's.

16:02.094 --> 16:04.654
But you were with him
in his last hour, right?

16:07.566 --> 16:11.730
I... I've had him cremated,

16:11.804 --> 16:15.934
and I wanted to do something special
with his ashes, you know.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.373
Maybe something he'd like.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.377
Do you got any ideas?

16:20.112 --> 16:21.909
Well, nothing that makes sense.

16:26.418 --> 16:31.219
Say, Edie, is that
an Aerosmith tattoo on your back?

16:32.224 --> 16:33.316
Yeah.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.553
You know I followed them
on tour, right?

16:36.428 --> 16:37.417
I didn't know that.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.929
I thought Joe Perry was so hot.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.831
Yeah?
So you were a groupie?

16:41.900 --> 16:44.425
No, man, much worse.
I did their laundry.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.164
They travel
with their own washer and dryer.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.172
I did everything
except Steven's stage clothes.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.969
You know, he likes
to send those out.

16:52.578 --> 16:57.481
So, Edie, I was thinking, you know, maybe
I could help you out with NTL Records.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.451
What makes you think
I need your help?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.045
Nothin'.

17:03.122 --> 17:08.219
Look, Chili...
let me tell you somethin'.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.386
I started NTL with Tommy.

17:10.462 --> 17:11.451
Right.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.054
- Equal partners.
- Yeah.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.566
And who do you think
found the Dub MD's?

17:15.634 --> 17:16.760
I did.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.660
Tommy's gone.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.968
And I'm devastated,
but I'm not about to roll over.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.406
I can run my own label.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.375
If anybody could, it's you.

17:27.746 --> 17:28.906
Hey, Edie.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.973
Why don't you get your clothes on
and let's get outta here, okay?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.211
Make you feel better.

17:33.285 --> 17:35.549
Besides, I wanna talk to you
about this girl Linda Moon.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.919
- Linda Moon?
- Yeah. She's a singer.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.480
Here, put this on.

17:42.761 --> 17:46.959
You know, I never made it
with any of those guys from Aerosmith.

17:47.032 --> 17:48.499
Yeah?

17:49.234 --> 17:51.930
I played tennis
with Tom Hamilton once, though.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.167
Christ.

17:55.774 --> 17:58.004
I was just a girl then.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.774
You'll always be a girl.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.853
Chil, thank you.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.159
- Who's this?
- That's Tiffany, Tommy's intern.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.022
How ya doing?
What's that?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.157
Pizza.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.759
He means the urn, genius.

18:25.571 --> 18:26.560
Tommy.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.900
You know, the cops
came by NTL last night.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.602
They were asking me about you.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.201
Yeah? What'd you say?

18:33.278 --> 18:35.838
Nothing. Just that you were
gonna make a movie about Tommy.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.882
It'd have to be a short.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.144
They take anything?

18:39.518 --> 18:42.146
Some boxes, a few files.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.781
But I think
what they were lookin' for was this.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.385
Thanks.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.052
Here.

18:52.764 --> 18:55.824
- Where'd you get this?
- Some guy with a Russian accent.

18:55.901 --> 18:56.890
It's NTL.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.403
You know, about a month ago,
he starts coming by,

18:59.471 --> 19:01.098
lookin' for Tommy.

19:01.173 --> 19:04.370
Tommy's in the office, what,
like three hours a week?

19:04.443 --> 19:07.037
So, this last time,
he takes a picture.

19:07.112 --> 19:10.172
He comes in,
doesn't even ask for Tommy,

19:10.249 --> 19:12.717
lights it on fire,

19:12.784 --> 19:14.911
and just tosses it on my desk.

19:15.954 --> 19:17.854
No questions, no nothing.

19:18.457 --> 19:21.949
Two days later, he comes back
and this time, Tommy's in.

19:22.027 --> 19:24.052
So I interrupt his meeting,
and I buzz him.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.565
He comes flying out of his office,
walks up to the guy,

19:28.634 --> 19:30.158
nails him right in the eye.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.764
<i>Just like that scene in Get Leo.</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:38.935
Then he tosses the guy on his ass
right in the middle of the street.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.980
I'm like, "Tommy,
who the hell was that?"

19:42.047 --> 19:43.241
Insurance salesman.

19:43.882 --> 19:44.871
Okay.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.479
An insurance salesman.

19:48.554 --> 19:51.022
Insurance scam.
I mean, geez, even I know that.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.556
Guy takes a picture
of your business,

19:52.624 --> 19:55.252
says either you pay up
or he puts your place on fire.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.524
Well, you know, Edie,
that was Tommy's specialty in Brooklyn.

19:58.597 --> 19:59.791
He sold protection.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.527
He could write a book
on the different ways to work it.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.794
Did this guy have a toupee?

20:05.437 --> 20:07.234
Not after Tommy hit him.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.475
Good morning.
Carosell Entertainment.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.345
You see the Chicks International?

20:19.284 --> 20:21.809
I think these girls are gonna be big,
the next big act to break.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.481
- Take my word for this.
- What's up, Nick?

20:24.556 --> 20:26.922
I'm telling you!
This Linda Moon.

20:26.992 --> 20:28.721
Is she a g-string diva or what?

20:28.794 --> 20:29.954
They give you wood?

20:30.028 --> 20:31.427
What's up, man?
I need to talk to you, Nick.

20:31.496 --> 20:32.963
They give me mahogany.

20:33.031 --> 20:34.020
Goddamn teak.

20:34.099 --> 20:36.966
You could deck the QE 2
with the wood they gave me.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.502
Who even cares if they can sing?

20:38.570 --> 20:40.595
Look, man, Chili Palmer
came up in the club. I gotta...

20:40.672 --> 20:42.503
You're still my bitch.
Love ya. Out.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.132
Man, we gotta talk
about this Chili Palmer.

20:44.209 --> 20:45.335
Robin, who's on three?

20:46.545 --> 20:48.843
Robert's on three,
Marty's on four.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.142
Don't be...

20:50.616 --> 20:53.016
Marty, you pimp.
Make me smile.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.110
Nick. Nick, for real.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.121
Look, I'm serious, man.
I need to talk to you here.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.453
- No. No, you did not.
- Can I talk to you for a minute, man?

21:00.225 --> 21:01.886
Marty, hold on a sec, will you?

21:03.595 --> 21:04.789
What do you want, Raj?

21:04.863 --> 21:07.354
It says in the paper that Chili Palmer
used to be a gangster.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.024
He was a hired hand.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.227
You know him?

21:10.302 --> 21:11.894
Tell me what you want, Raj.

21:13.005 --> 21:16.338
Linda Moon says she's gonna leave
and have Chili Palmer be her manager.

21:16.408 --> 21:17.705
She told you that?

21:17.776 --> 21:19.107
<i>No, man, he told me that.</i>

21:19.177 --> 21:20.269
What'd you do?

21:20.345 --> 21:22.711
I told him she's got five years
on her contract, you know.

21:22.781 --> 21:26.512
You feel you had to explain it to him?
You didn't kick his ass?

21:26.585 --> 21:28.246
Man, he hit Elliot
right in the damn throat.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.617
He broke him smooth down.

21:29.688 --> 21:32.680
Wow. What a surprise.
Elliot's a faggot.

21:32.758 --> 21:33.782
Pussy.

21:33.859 --> 21:36.089
You think it's cool to have a queer
for a bodyguard?

21:36.161 --> 21:37.219
What good is he?

21:37.729 --> 21:39.458
Chili Palmer's no manager.

21:39.531 --> 21:40.759
He's a talker.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.595
You shoulda hit him in the mouth.

21:42.668 --> 21:45.967
What he does is make movies
about shylocks, 'cause that's all he was.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.096
A shylock.

21:47.172 --> 21:48.867
<i>That's right.
He did that movie Get Lost.</i>

21:48.940 --> 21:51.841
That's my shit, man.
That shit was tight.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.571
There is no way
we are losing Linda Moon.

21:53.645 --> 21:57.979
"A", she's under contract,
and "B", she's under contract.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.176
So, what's crackin'?

22:00.252 --> 22:01.879
You want Joe Loop.

22:01.953 --> 22:04.217
Man, all I want is
for Chili Palmer to disappear.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.883
You want Joe Loop.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.565
Yeah. Joe Loop.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.668
<i>Loop, Nick Carr said I should call.</i>

22:26.745 --> 22:27.803
Yeah, sure.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.278
<i>Well, I got something
for you to take care of</i>

22:29.348 --> 22:30.815
<i>or do I need to call somebody else?</i>

22:30.882 --> 22:33.373
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

22:33.452 --> 22:35.249
I would love to.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.197
Here's your breakfast, sweetie.

22:50.268 --> 22:52.236
Pancakes again?

22:52.304 --> 22:55.535
Panca... Yes, pancakes again.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.066
Baby, would you tell this girl

22:58.143 --> 23:00.737
when we were comin' up,
all we had was sugar sandwiches?

23:00.812 --> 23:03.280
Please. She does not know
how good she has it.

23:03.348 --> 23:06.044
She does not know
how good she has it.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.279
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Mommy.

23:08.353 --> 23:09.581
Bye, baby.

23:09.654 --> 23:11.554
Deshawn, eat the pancakes, okay?

23:11.623 --> 23:14.990
I put cinnamon on there,
there's butter, they're very good.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.891
The strawberries are fresh.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.361
Eat up.
We got ten minutes, okay?

23:18.430 --> 23:19.761
I don't want you to be late.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.433
Top of the morning, Marge.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.770
Top of the morning, Sin.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.883
Ain't this somethin'?

23:58.370 --> 23:59.394
What's up, dawg?

23:59.471 --> 24:01.405
Must you play into the stereotypes?

24:01.473 --> 24:03.134
Turn that mess down.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.470
This is the suburbs.

24:04.543 --> 24:07.068
I'm on the damn Neighborhood Watch.

24:09.581 --> 24:12.482
- Who did it?
- Not me.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.478
You know, that bitch
owed me 300 grand.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.579
I shoulda sent the coalition.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.453
Now shit's gonna have to get ugly.

24:19.524 --> 24:20.616
Ugly?

24:20.692 --> 24:23.525
<i>Why you trippin'?
It ain't like you need it.</i>

24:23.595 --> 24:25.859
Dabu, it's the principle.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.923
Today it's 300 grand,
tomorrow it's three million.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.729
I gotta send a message.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.133
I feel ya, dawg.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.895
You talk to the PD?

24:34.973 --> 24:36.133
The police?

24:36.208 --> 24:38.608
"The poli... "
The program director.

24:40.011 --> 24:41.603
Check this out.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.818
Well, hello, Mr. Program Director.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.292
You see what happen
when you don't spin my records?

24:59.764 --> 25:01.231
Good morning, guys!

25:03.535 --> 25:05.093
Hey, y'all, speak to my daughter.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.865
Good morning, Deshawn!

25:06.938 --> 25:10.635
Deshawn, sweetie,
why don't you go back inside?

25:10.709 --> 25:11.698
Okay?

25:11.910 --> 25:13.639
Daddy's having a little meeting.

25:13.712 --> 25:16.010
I'll take you to school in my car.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.410
Bye, guys!

25:18.483 --> 25:20.576
Good-bye, Deshawn!

25:20.652 --> 25:22.142
Okay, boo-boo.

25:23.421 --> 25:24.615
All right.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.822
Play my records!
You hear me? Play! Play!

25:32.898 --> 25:33.956
Play my records!

25:34.032 --> 25:36.728
Play Dub Records! Dub MD's!

25:37.202 --> 25:39.432
- Move yo' head. Move it.
- Stay still!

25:41.907 --> 25:42.931
She gone?

25:43.475 --> 25:44.305
I'm telling you, Edie,

25:44.376 --> 25:46.970
she's got a voice,
she's got the attitude.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.912
- You're gonna love her.
- Sounds like you love her.

25:49.981 --> 25:53.417
Well, if you're asking me
if I think she's talented, yes.

25:55.353 --> 25:56.718
I can't believe this.

25:56.788 --> 26:00.690
Condolences on a two-way and
half of them are Tommy's ex-girlfriends.

26:02.460 --> 26:06.055
Look, Chil, producing an album,
you know, it's not like making a movie.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.155
Good.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.599
I think movies are too corporate.
I like to be spontaneous and creative.

26:10.669 --> 26:14.036
I'm just saying, you know,
the music biz is a bitch, you know?

26:14.105 --> 26:16.005
It's dangerous.
It's rough out there.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.439
Believe me, I know.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.000
That's why I loved working at
MoMo's club, if you know what I mean.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.804
What'd you do at MoMo's?
You book bands?

26:23.515 --> 26:24.641
Not really.

26:25.283 --> 26:28.218
- Were you a bouncer?
- Not really.

26:31.823 --> 26:33.916
You really were a shylock,
weren't you?

26:33.992 --> 26:36.358
Did I tell you
that she writes her own music?

26:42.567 --> 26:43.932
Here she is.

26:48.106 --> 26:50.370
Here we go.
You ready to show off?

26:50.442 --> 26:53.570
Chili, look, I'm so sorry,
but my damn replacement didn't show up.

26:53.645 --> 26:54.942
I ended up stuck in the drive-through.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.241
It's all right.
Calm down, calm down.

26:56.314 --> 26:57.406
Edie, Linda.

26:57.482 --> 26:59.609
Linda, this is Edie Athens.
This is Tommy's widow.

26:59.684 --> 27:01.117
Hi. Nice to meet you.

27:01.186 --> 27:04.349
- Look, I'm really sorry about being late.
- Don't worry about it.

27:04.422 --> 27:06.720
So Chili tells me
you've got a great voice.

27:06.791 --> 27:07.883
Really?

27:07.959 --> 27:09.153
Well, you do.

27:09.694 --> 27:11.127
That is so sweet.
Thank you.

27:11.196 --> 27:12.891
Is this where you play?

27:13.965 --> 27:16.900
I can't really afford my own piano,
so they let me play here.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.334
Come on, let's go hear you.
Yeah? Let's go.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.315
Life is what you make it

28:14.392 --> 28:17.088
At least that's what they say

28:17.162 --> 28:19.722
Well, I think I'm gonna make it

28:19.798 --> 28:22.790
Fulfill my dreams someday

28:22.867 --> 28:25.597
I feel this fire growing

28:25.670 --> 28:28.366
Deep inside of me

28:28.440 --> 28:33.969
I'm so inspired knowing
that it's my destiny

28:34.045 --> 28:36.946
I breathe like a champion

28:37.015 --> 28:39.643
I dream like a champion

28:39.718 --> 28:42.710
I see I'm a champion

28:42.787 --> 28:45.347
It's meant to be

28:45.423 --> 28:48.290
My will's getting stronger

28:48.359 --> 28:51.385
I can't wait any longer

28:51.463 --> 28:56.867
I'm singing a song
that's inside of me

28:56.935 --> 29:02.567
'Cause I'm a believer

29:02.640 --> 29:07.839
I know that I can make it
no matter what they say

29:07.912 --> 29:14.147
'Cause I'm a believer

29:14.219 --> 29:16.915
The future is now

29:16.988 --> 29:25.020
It starts today

29:32.804 --> 29:34.032
I'm impressed.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.697
Did you write that song?

29:35.774 --> 29:37.571
<i>Yeah. It's called I'm A Believer.</i>

29:37.642 --> 29:40.202
Just tell us you got
nine more just like it.

29:41.079 --> 29:42.376
Forty more.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.574
But as long as I can do 'em my way.

29:45.183 --> 29:46.309
I like that.

29:47.152 --> 29:49.177
- Let's get you in the studio.
- All right.

29:49.254 --> 29:50.551
Good girl.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.715
You weren't kidding.
I mean, the girl's got something.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.725
- She's amazing.
- I told you.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.158
I mean, the only thing is, you know,

29:56.227 --> 29:58.661
it costs a lot of money
to break someone, you know?

29:58.730 --> 30:01.460
I mean, we gotta pay a mixer,
a publicist.

30:03.401 --> 30:04.459
Hey, look.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.470
- Steven Tyler's in town.
- Yeah.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.768
Aerosmith playing
at the Staples Center.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.970
<i>Tell me Dream On is not the greatest
rock 'n' roll song you ever heard.</i>

30:13.044 --> 30:14.978
You know what we oughta do,
we oughta call him.

30:15.046 --> 30:16.343
- Call who?
- Steven.

30:16.414 --> 30:17.438
Why?

30:17.515 --> 30:20.882
So he could listen to Linda's music,
he could see for himself it's terrific,

30:20.952 --> 30:23.045
and maybe he'll help us launch her
at his concert.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.923
- That's a great idea, Chil.
- Yeah.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.891
Hey, and maybe
Bono and Sting'll come down

30:28.960 --> 30:31.053
and we could all cut
a Christmas album.

30:31.129 --> 30:32.653
You know him, don't you?

30:32.730 --> 30:35.699
Know him? Steven Tyler.
Chili, I know his socks!

30:35.767 --> 30:37.029
He's never gonna remember me.

30:37.101 --> 30:40.502
Edie, you have a tattoo of Aerosmith
on your ass.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.301
You can't get a meeting with him?

30:42.907 --> 30:46.365
We want Steven Tyler,
we get Steven Tyler.

31:02.961 --> 31:04.952
<i>I would let the music
do the talking to me</i>

31:05.029 --> 31:07.623
<i>to tell me what lyrics to sing.</i>

31:07.699 --> 31:10.964
<i>And even when I got caught up
in not having anything pre-written,</i>

31:11.035 --> 31:14.095
<i>which I never did, I would scat to it.</i>

31:18.509 --> 31:20.204
<i>It's just the music,
it's the funk.</i>

31:20.278 --> 31:22.940
<i>It's the sound, it's the words,
it's the rhyme, it's the shit.</i>

31:23.014 --> 31:25.642
<i>You can't be creative
unless you step outside a little bit.</i>

31:25.717 --> 31:27.082
<i>It's...</i>

31:35.693 --> 31:37.251
A little early, aren't you?

31:37.762 --> 31:39.627
Open house is on Sunday.

32:23.341 --> 32:24.740
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, it's Chili Palmer.</i>

32:24.809 --> 32:26.868
<i>- Yo, Chil.
- How soon can you get here?</i>

32:33.618 --> 32:35.882
2:00 A.M.
And there's traffic on the 405.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.618
- Who's your friend?
- I don't know.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.752
I come home and he's bleeding
all over my one-sheet.

32:43.828 --> 32:45.386
Is this the guy that did Tommy Athens?

32:45.463 --> 32:48.830
Nah. That guy had a black eye
and was wearing a rug.

32:49.434 --> 32:52.096
This ain't no rug, pal.
This guy's got plugs.

32:52.603 --> 32:53.900
I hate plugs.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.633
It looks like doll's hair.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.641
Personally, I think grafting's
the only way to go.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.233
The look's more natural.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.141
That's, of course,
'cause they use your own hair.

33:01.212 --> 33:02.236
Very interesting.

33:02.313 --> 33:03.473
Now are you gonna
help me out with him?

33:03.548 --> 33:04.776
Is that why you called me here?

33:04.849 --> 33:06.680
Yeah. You're a big guy.
I don't want to do it alone.

33:06.751 --> 33:07.979
Come on, up.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.383
Get this wallet outta here
before the cops come.

33:12.223 --> 33:13.747
All right, set him down.

33:18.796 --> 33:20.229
Here we go.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.663
Ivan Surva...

33:23.468 --> 33:24.696
He's Russian.

33:24.769 --> 33:26.896
Been here for five months.

33:26.971 --> 33:29.030
The guy that killed Tommy,
he saw you, right?

33:29.107 --> 33:30.836
- Yeah.
- So you could I.D. Him.

33:30.908 --> 33:32.500
Then he sees your picture
in the paper,

33:32.577 --> 33:35.171
then he sends doll hair guy
here to take you out.

33:35.246 --> 33:36.736
So while he was waiting for me,

33:36.814 --> 33:39.374
he got depressed
and shot himself in the back?

33:39.450 --> 33:41.042
Good point.

33:44.222 --> 33:46.452
Who are all these people
trying to kill you?

33:47.258 --> 33:48.452
I don't know.

33:48.526 --> 33:51.518
But I'm in the music business now.
It could be anybody.

33:55.099 --> 33:57.659
Mugambo, my brother,
you check out the Chicks?

33:59.604 --> 34:03.096
I told you, bro.
This Linda Moon... she's a belter.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.341
Mugambo, I gotta jump.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.274
Love you, bro.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.842
Get me Raji on the phone.

34:30.301 --> 34:31.324
What's up?
It's Raji.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.632
<i>Hey, Lowenthal. Joe Loops
was supposed to kill Chili Palmer.</i>

34:34.705 --> 34:36.366
<i>Instead, he killed
some goddamn Russian.</i>

34:36.440 --> 34:37.465
For real?

34:37.542 --> 34:40.534
<i>You two better work this shit out
or your ass is next.</i>

34:41.045 --> 34:42.569
<i>Stupid-ass.</i>

34:50.688 --> 34:52.315
I gotta tell you the truth.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.255
I never seen a hit like this before.

34:55.326 --> 34:58.227
I mean, you actually gotta get in line
to whack this guy.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.196
How many men
have you whacked, Joe?

35:03.768 --> 35:05.395
Why, you wanna be next?

35:06.938 --> 35:10.430
I'm asking you
because you hit the wrong guy.

35:12.743 --> 35:15.507
They serve one hell of
a stuffed cabbage here, you know that?

35:15.580 --> 35:17.138
The thing that
you wanna remember though is

35:17.215 --> 35:19.342
don't eat it too late
because it tends to stay with you.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.009
Yeah. I'll definitely keep that in mind.

35:23.754 --> 35:25.085
Where we at, Joe?

35:25.156 --> 35:26.555
We ain't nowhere.

35:27.325 --> 35:29.486
I now gotta go find the right guy.

35:31.162 --> 35:34.290
The thing is it'll cost you
another five grand.

35:34.365 --> 35:36.765
What are you talkin' about?
Man, I already paid you.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.028
You're the one who did the wrong guy.

35:38.102 --> 35:40.127
Well, whose fault is that?

35:41.439 --> 35:42.838
It's your fault.

35:46.711 --> 35:49.145
Tough shit.
That's the cost of doing business.

35:49.213 --> 35:51.977
Look, you tell Nicky
that there's now a new contract,

35:52.049 --> 35:53.846
and I need another five grand.

35:53.918 --> 35:56.352
I can talk the deal with you,
'cause it's my contract, all right?

35:56.420 --> 35:58.786
- That's why I'm here with you.
- You can't talk shit.

35:59.357 --> 36:00.619
You're Nicky's girl.

36:00.691 --> 36:02.454
Me and Nick are partners.

36:02.527 --> 36:05.462
We discuss all facets
of the business together.

36:05.530 --> 36:08.465
Be it music,
be it underworld, girls.

36:08.533 --> 36:09.795
Let me ask you a question.

36:12.570 --> 36:13.901
Nice get-up you got.

36:13.971 --> 36:15.700
How come he calls you his bitch?

36:15.773 --> 36:16.865
What?

36:16.941 --> 36:19.739
His bitch.
Why does he call you his bitch?

36:20.278 --> 36:21.336
What, mother...?!

36:21.412 --> 36:22.470
Did I stutter?

36:22.547 --> 36:27.712
What if I called you
a fat, stupid guinea bee-yatch?

36:28.519 --> 36:29.884
Bee-yatch!

36:37.828 --> 36:41.491
I'd take this baseball bat that I got
out in the back of my Cadillac,

36:41.566 --> 36:44.399
and I'd swat you
across the mouth with it.

36:44.468 --> 36:47.437
<i>I said what if I called you that.</i>

36:47.505 --> 36:49.097
Hypothetically, just a scenario.

36:49.173 --> 36:50.435
I wasn't actually saying it to you.

36:50.508 --> 36:52.100
I'm always lookin' out.
I gotta operate.

36:52.176 --> 36:53.575
I wanna make sure
I got the right guy.

36:53.644 --> 36:55.407
Now I need the right guy
to get the right guy.

36:55.479 --> 36:57.970
Now I want the five grand up front.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.812
Tonight at the Mayan.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.442
What? The what?

37:01.519 --> 37:03.384
Take the wax
outta your goddamn ears.

37:03.454 --> 37:04.819
The Mayan, downtown.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.415
I never happen
to have heard of the Mayan,

37:08.492 --> 37:10.790
so I was making sure
I knew where it was.

37:10.861 --> 37:12.658
You mean there's something
you haven't heard of?

37:15.733 --> 37:16.791
Okay, man.

37:16.867 --> 37:18.391
All right, take off.

37:18.469 --> 37:19.493
Are we cool?

37:20.905 --> 37:22.338
Come on, man.

37:23.140 --> 37:25.165
J. Leazy! What's up?

37:25.243 --> 37:26.574
My man!

37:27.912 --> 37:29.675
- All right. I feel that.
- Take off.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.807
Mad respect for not giving respect.
I feel you.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.178
Let me tell you something.
Don't do that "J. Leazy" shit.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.551
That's what your name is.

37:37.622 --> 37:39.112
I don't like that.
Don't do it.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.159
I'll see you at the Mayan club, my man.

37:43.227 --> 37:46.196
Mad respect to you, Loop.
Stone-face killer.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.858
Next time try to find
something red to wear.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.331
The future is now

37:56.407 --> 38:02.403
It starts today

38:02.480 --> 38:03.879
How about that?

38:03.948 --> 38:05.813
Yeah, that girl's voice
is off the chain.

38:05.883 --> 38:08.852
But I gotta say, she needs a sound.

38:08.919 --> 38:10.682
What are you saying?
That she can't sing?

38:10.755 --> 38:13.019
No. Chili, that girl can totally sing.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.990
- What do you mean?
- But is she a star?

38:15.059 --> 38:17.027
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:17.094 --> 38:19.358
<i>Okay. Take American Idol, okay?</i>

38:19.430 --> 38:22.831
All those girls, they can sing, right?

38:22.900 --> 38:24.595
But who cares, right?
Who are they?

38:24.669 --> 38:27.502
And then you take, like, J. Lo, and it's
like that shit's been remixed so much,

38:27.571 --> 38:29.198
I could be Jenny from the block.

38:29.273 --> 38:30.968
Are you gonna produce this or not?

38:31.042 --> 38:34.478
Well, leave it to Tommy.
I mean, the last of the great spenders.

38:34.545 --> 38:36.035
No wonder he kept
the books locked up.

38:36.113 --> 38:37.842
All right, because they're empty.

38:37.915 --> 38:40.315
We don't own any of this stuff.
We're broke.

38:40.384 --> 38:41.373
How can that be?

38:41.452 --> 38:43.613
I mean, you must have made a pile
off of Dub MD's alone.

38:43.688 --> 38:45.417
That's Weapons of Mass Destruction.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.478
I know who they are.

38:46.557 --> 38:48.855
Yeah, well, whatever we made off them,
I can't find it in the books,

38:48.926 --> 38:51.121
which means we can't afford
to record her,

38:51.195 --> 38:53.755
which means no masters,
which means no CDs,

38:53.831 --> 38:56.595
which sure as hell means
no more NTL Records.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.066
Hello?

38:58.569 --> 39:00.230
So, what'd you think?

39:00.838 --> 39:02.829
I would love to produce your record.

39:02.907 --> 39:06.206
And because I am going
to produce it, it will rock.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.471
That's great.

39:07.545 --> 39:09.570
So Capitol can miss you
for a few days?

39:09.647 --> 39:11.137
I think we can negotiate that.

39:11.215 --> 39:13.274
Wait, you were with Capitol?

39:13.351 --> 39:15.615
I was supposed to meet
an A&R guy over there,

39:15.686 --> 39:18.746
but then I signed with Nick Carr.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.523
Excuse me, Linda.

39:27.765 --> 39:30.632
Did you just say
you're under contract with Nick Carr?

39:31.302 --> 39:32.462
No, not anymore.

39:32.536 --> 39:35.664
Actually, Chili told Raji
that it was cancelled.

39:37.675 --> 39:40.109
Linda? Why don't you
take a break, honey?

39:40.177 --> 39:41.269
All right.

39:59.630 --> 40:02.360
Chili, it doesn't work like that, okay?

40:02.433 --> 40:04.594
I mean, you've gotta
get the contract back from him.

40:04.668 --> 40:06.602
Otherwise, he still runs the show.

40:06.670 --> 40:07.932
Edie, I was a shylock.

40:08.005 --> 40:09.529
I know how these things work.

40:09.607 --> 40:12.508
I've known Nicky for years.
You'll get your contract.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.142
Slight problem.

40:27.358 --> 40:28.450
This could be ugly.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.653
- Why is that?
- That's Sin LaSalle.

40:30.728 --> 40:33.162
He manages and produces
the Dub MD's.

40:33.297 --> 40:34.559
Tommy owe him money?

40:35.800 --> 40:37.927
I would say yes.

40:38.002 --> 40:40.061
- Tiffany, man the phones.
- Okay.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.537
Hy, get in the office.
Look like you know what you're doing.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.006
Edie, I want you behind the desk.
You're still the boss.

40:45.075 --> 40:47.509
These guys need to see
that NTL is still in business.

40:47.578 --> 40:49.205
Okay.
Where should I hide the books?

40:49.280 --> 40:50.577
Leave them on the desk.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.940
And whatever you do,
don't mention the Russians.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.411
Don't mention the Russians.
Okay.

41:02.760 --> 41:07.094
No. No, we're totally booked.
But that would've been good.

41:08.265 --> 41:09.823
Hang on one second.

41:10.668 --> 41:13.865
Sin, honey!
How are you?

41:13.938 --> 41:15.599
Enough with the pleasantries.

41:15.673 --> 41:17.265
Where's our money, Edie?

41:20.945 --> 41:22.572
Sin.

41:22.646 --> 41:25.171
Sin LaSalle. Man!

41:26.550 --> 41:28.950
What's up?! Come on!

41:29.653 --> 41:30.745
No?

41:30.821 --> 41:33.346
Okay, you know what?
I totally get it, man.

41:33.424 --> 41:34.914
I totally get it.
First of all, welcome to NTL.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.892
Second of all,
I wanna introduce myself.

41:36.961 --> 41:38.986
Hy Gordon.
I know who you are.

41:39.063 --> 41:41.156
- See?
- Capitol Records.

41:41.232 --> 41:44.861
Eight years ago,
you turned down our demo, Hyman.

41:44.935 --> 41:46.766
You know what, Sin?
You know Capitol, man.

41:46.837 --> 41:49.067
It's like art by committee
over there, okay?

41:49.139 --> 41:54.099
Personally, I totally, totally dug
all y'all's sound, all right?

41:54.178 --> 41:56.510
Seriously, I'm thinkin'
about leavin' Capitol.

41:57.882 --> 42:01.875
Look, Sin, you know,
Tommy left his will a mess.

42:01.952 --> 42:03.419
You know, if you just give us
a few weeks...

42:03.487 --> 42:06.388
Right. Then I'd call up
and the phone is disconnected.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.226
Why don't you write us
a check for 300 grand

42:09.293 --> 42:11.124
and we'll kindly be on our way.

42:11.195 --> 42:14.289
Sin, you know we don't have
that kind of money on hand.

42:15.432 --> 42:17.559
Then I need to check your books.

42:19.770 --> 42:21.135
Be cool.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.871
Be cool?

42:23.941 --> 42:25.431
You don't know me.

42:25.509 --> 42:28.069
I know you a whole lot better
than you think I do.

42:28.145 --> 42:30.613
Ivy League rich kid.
Goes to Wharton.

42:30.681 --> 42:32.308
Gets an MBA.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.010
Puts on some Timberlands
and a throwback

42:34.084 --> 42:36.484
and suddenly you got street cred?

42:43.060 --> 42:45.290
Look, I'll tell you the truth, okay?

42:46.630 --> 42:47.961
The Russians took it.

42:48.966 --> 42:50.297
The what?

42:50.367 --> 42:53.063
The Russians.
With one of those insurance scams.

42:53.137 --> 42:55.469
You know, like "give us half a mil
and we won't kill you"?

42:55.539 --> 42:56.904
And, Sin, you knew Tommy, right?

42:56.974 --> 42:59.272
I mean, he never wanted any trouble.

42:59.343 --> 43:01.072
I mean, he gave him
everything we have,

43:01.145 --> 43:03.739
but these Russians,
okay, these monsters,

43:03.814 --> 43:05.406
they're animals.

43:05.482 --> 43:07.313
They kept on coming back
for more and more,

43:07.384 --> 43:09.011
so Tommy told 'em get lost.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.077
To make a long story short...

43:13.490 --> 43:14.957
...I'm a widow now.

43:29.740 --> 43:30.968
Oh, my God.

43:52.930 --> 43:54.363
Excuse me, Chuckles.

44:01.538 --> 44:03.233
It's my wife's cousin.

44:05.609 --> 44:08.407
I really enjoyed that story, Edie.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.379
I mean, Russians.

44:10.447 --> 44:11.573
Russians.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.048
I know it's hard, but...

44:13.117 --> 44:14.550
I'm a highly educated man.

44:14.618 --> 44:19.055
Sincerely, you don't expect me
to believe a story about some Russians.

44:19.890 --> 44:22.757
Now, I suggest
that you open up those books

44:22.826 --> 44:25.761
or things gonna get real ugly
up in here.

44:25.829 --> 44:27.694
Sin, the books are
none of your business.

44:27.765 --> 44:30.063
You'll get the money when NTL has it.

44:31.235 --> 44:32.224
Dabu.

44:32.302 --> 44:33.360
Thank you. Thank you!

44:33.437 --> 44:35.496
Poppin' me is not gonna
do you any good.

44:35.572 --> 44:38.541
But if you wait till Friday,
I get you your money plus the vig.

44:40.144 --> 44:42.578
Plus the vig. All right.
All right, okay.

44:42.646 --> 44:44.807
Everybody cool out.
Everybody calm down.

44:48.318 --> 44:49.910
Calm down, calm down.

44:49.987 --> 44:52.615
Wait, so you sayin' plus the vig?

44:52.690 --> 44:53.918
Plus the vig.

44:53.991 --> 44:56.892
All right. Okay.
All right, all right, cool.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.188
All right, we gonna do this.

44:58.262 --> 45:00.230
Dabu. Bu!

45:00.297 --> 45:02.265
Never get to shoot nobody!
Never!

45:02.332 --> 45:04.425
Don't never let me do
what I wanna do!

45:04.501 --> 45:06.867
You know, it's a long day, man.

45:06.937 --> 45:09.064
You'll get a chance
to kill somebody, all right?

45:09.139 --> 45:12.131
Calm down.
We got some other stops to make today.

45:12.209 --> 45:16.908
All right, so I'm not gonna
kill y'all today.

45:17.748 --> 45:19.511
Now, I'll be generous.

45:19.583 --> 45:22.450
But come Friday,
if you don't have my money,

45:22.519 --> 45:26.455
the next meeting I arrange will be
between you and Tommy Athens,

45:26.523 --> 45:28.457
if you get what I'm sayin'.

45:29.093 --> 45:30.287
I feel ya.

45:30.461 --> 45:31.860
You feel me. You...

45:40.137 --> 45:41.331
Dabu.

45:42.072 --> 45:43.130
Player.

45:54.651 --> 45:57.814
The vig.
I mean, what's a vig?

45:57.888 --> 45:59.822
Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?

45:59.890 --> 46:02.358
You're gonna give him
your fancy equipment, okay?

46:02.426 --> 46:03.586
Or you're gonna have a garage sale.

46:03.660 --> 46:05.389
We're not selling anything.

46:06.730 --> 46:07.788
Hey, where are you goin'?

46:07.865 --> 46:09.059
Gotta see Nicky Carr.

46:09.133 --> 46:11.897
Black Eyed Peas are playing tonight,
if you're interested.

46:23.680 --> 46:26.308
You say there's a dark parking lot
by the Mayan, right?

46:28.452 --> 46:30.215
Why you trippin' on me, Elliot?

46:30.287 --> 46:32.482
Are you still crying
over that Chili Palmer shit?

46:33.157 --> 46:35.819
No. He just... he said
he was gonna call me, that's all.

46:35.893 --> 46:37.360
And did he call you back?

46:37.427 --> 46:39.418
He's just messing
with your head, man!

46:39.496 --> 46:42.226
Ain't no Samoan faggot
going by the name Elliot Wilhelm

46:42.299 --> 46:44.358
is gonna make it to the big screen.

46:44.434 --> 46:46.561
Raisin' a goddamn eyebrow.

46:46.637 --> 46:49.105
I understand shit like this
'cause I ain't a homo.

46:49.173 --> 46:51.471
Once you turn faggot,
you lose all self-respect.

46:51.542 --> 46:52.736
You're not wired right.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.804
Man, what the hell
you stoppin' the car here for?

46:57.881 --> 46:58.870
Man, you crazy?

46:58.949 --> 47:00.280
You move the car,
we can all get to work.

47:00.350 --> 47:01.817
Man, why you
stopping the car here, man?

47:01.885 --> 47:02.874
What are you doin'?

47:02.953 --> 47:05.114
- Get your ass back in the car.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

47:05.189 --> 47:06.281
Steering wheel's
in the front of the car, fool.

47:06.356 --> 47:07.846
What's up? What?

47:07.925 --> 47:09.654
You say it again and I quit.

47:09.726 --> 47:11.489
What'd I say?
The faggot thing?

47:11.562 --> 47:12.722
The homo?

47:12.796 --> 47:14.991
Man, I'm walkin'.
I ain't even trippin', man.

47:15.065 --> 47:17.533
I'm... What'd I say?
What'd I say?

47:17.601 --> 47:20.126
Okay, Elliot, I know you frustrated
with all this bodyguard shit and whatnot.

47:20.204 --> 47:22.468
I smell you, man.
I feel you pain.

47:22.539 --> 47:25.007
This shit's temporary.
Stop crowdin' my shit.

47:25.075 --> 47:26.667
When I signed you four years ago,

47:26.743 --> 47:28.574
I said, "Man, that man can sing".

47:28.645 --> 47:31.170
I said, "He's gonna be a big star".
A big star, man.

47:31.248 --> 47:34.308
That's why I laid out all the paper
to put you up in a video.

47:34.384 --> 47:36.511
I put paper down, man,
to put you in a video.

47:36.587 --> 47:37.576
Right?

47:37.654 --> 47:40.088
No one else
on this damn beach has a video.

47:40.157 --> 47:41.249
Man, I love you like a brother.

47:41.325 --> 47:43.589
I used to bag on you all the time.
Man, you trippin'.

47:44.294 --> 47:45.818
Why you doin' that, man?

47:45.896 --> 47:47.989
Wanna take a shot at me, kid?
Do it.

47:48.065 --> 47:49.327
Do it!

47:50.767 --> 47:53.827
I'm just sayin' if that's what this
is gonna be, then it's gonna be that.

47:53.904 --> 47:56.737
But I would prefer to stay
on the same page.

47:56.807 --> 47:58.900
Man, let your voice be your ladder.
Man, I'm serious.

47:58.976 --> 48:01.069
This acting shit
got you acting crazy, man.

48:01.144 --> 48:03.977
What's up?
You know I love you, man.

48:04.781 --> 48:06.112
Come on, man.

48:06.683 --> 48:09.743
E. Weazy!
Come on, baby!

48:09.920 --> 48:11.945
E. Weazy!
Come on, baby.

48:12.022 --> 48:14.582
E. Weazy.

48:14.658 --> 48:16.285
Come on, I'm clownin', baby.

48:16.360 --> 48:19.420
You know I'm clownin'.
Turn around 'cause you know I'm clownin'.

48:19.496 --> 48:21.862
Come on, player, stop hatin'.
Stop hatin'.

48:21.932 --> 48:25.493
Start participatin'.
Start participatin', star.

48:25.569 --> 48:28.436
Come on, twinkle, twinkle, baby.
Twinkle, twinkle.

48:34.711 --> 48:37.509
Come on, Larry.
You sound like an A&R guy.

48:37.581 --> 48:40.812
I'm bangin' the phones
like a goddamn wild man.

48:44.121 --> 48:47.318
Larry, I'll call you back.

48:53.730 --> 48:55.925
I heard Sean Penn lives up here.

48:55.999 --> 48:59.400
- You see him much?
- Not as much as I'd like.

49:01.905 --> 49:03.463
How'd you get in here?

49:03.540 --> 49:05.599
Your maid left the back door open.

49:07.644 --> 49:10.238
- I don't have a maid.
- I can tell.

49:11.214 --> 49:13.842
Come on. Get out of here
before I have to shoot you.

49:13.917 --> 49:17.182
Nah, Nicky, sit down
and stop being such a hard-on.

49:22.225 --> 49:25.524
So, Mr. Red Hot Chili Pepper.

49:26.296 --> 49:28.526
I heard you were at the Viper Room.

49:28.598 --> 49:30.498
So Raji told you about Linda Moon.

49:30.567 --> 49:32.228
She's something else, huh?

49:32.302 --> 49:34.031
The heart and soul of that group.

49:34.104 --> 49:37.801
I'm telling you, bro,
the Chicks are gonna be big.

49:37.874 --> 49:40.707
How's that?
By singing songs from the '70s?

49:40.777 --> 49:42.142
Don't laugh.

49:42.212 --> 49:44.203
You see, you're a movie guy,
so you don't know,

49:44.281 --> 49:46.875
but the music biz,
it goes in cycles.

49:46.950 --> 49:47.939
It's like Linda.

49:48.018 --> 49:49.986
When I signed her,
girl power was dead.

49:50.053 --> 49:52.419
It was the era
of the singer-songwriter.

49:52.489 --> 49:54.081
But now the market's flooded.

49:54.157 --> 49:57.320
What do the labels want?
Girl groups.

49:57.394 --> 49:59.225
Nicky, look at me.

50:00.130 --> 50:01.529
I am.

50:01.598 --> 50:03.657
I want Linda's contract.

50:03.734 --> 50:06.328
If you want to produce
Linda's album, great.

50:06.403 --> 50:08.633
I'm sure you can even get
a buck a record.

50:08.705 --> 50:11.196
But I got her booked
into some major gigs, bro.

50:11.274 --> 50:13.799
And I'm two seconds away
from getting her a deal.

50:13.877 --> 50:17.973
You mean you've had Linda for two years
and you've never gotten her a record deal?

50:18.048 --> 50:20.516
Chili, a trio is not born overnight.

50:20.584 --> 50:23.610
I've had her for three days,
and I already got her a label.

50:23.687 --> 50:25.882
So it looks
like we don't need you, Nicky.

50:26.456 --> 50:28.151
Let's get something straight.

50:28.925 --> 50:31.018
This isn't the movies.

50:31.094 --> 50:34.894
You can't tell everyone you're a wise guy
and charm their pants off.

50:34.965 --> 50:36.956
This is the music business.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.626
We're all wise guys.

50:38.702 --> 50:41.262
All right, wise guy, I'll make you a deal.

50:42.906 --> 50:46.433
Carosell, which is the dumbest name
I've ever heard for a company,

50:46.510 --> 50:48.478
gives me Linda Moon's contract,

50:48.545 --> 50:51.480
and if you ever threaten her
in any way,

50:51.548 --> 50:54.381
you'll regret it
for as long as you live, if that.

50:55.318 --> 50:56.842
That's some deal.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.444
What's in it for me?

50:58.522 --> 51:01.650
I'll just make-believe that that dead
Russian that I found in my house

51:01.725 --> 51:03.420
had nothing to do with you.

51:05.629 --> 51:07.460
You don't know
what you're doing, Chil.

51:08.432 --> 51:11.401
What makes you even think
Linda could make it on her own?

51:12.269 --> 51:13.827
She's got me.

51:16.973 --> 51:22.036
He's gonna cry till I tell him
that I'll never roam

51:22.112 --> 51:27.778
So, Chattanooga Choo-Choo,
won't you choo-choo me home?

51:28.518 --> 51:30.281
So, you're like a rapper now?

51:30.353 --> 51:31.945
Sniff Doggy Doo-doo.

51:32.689 --> 51:34.418
You clownin' my gear again?

51:34.491 --> 51:36.652
You know you like this, Joe.
Come on, Joe!

51:36.726 --> 51:38.921
You know my style
makes the ladies smile.

51:39.896 --> 51:41.454
<i>They just started
Chattanooga Choo-Choo.</i>

51:41.531 --> 51:42.930
I love that song.
I can't believe they did that.

51:42.999 --> 51:44.227
Damn, man.
I wish I coulda heard that.

51:44.301 --> 51:45.700
I like a good choo-choo song.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.293
Look, do you want your money
or what, my man?

51:47.370 --> 51:49.270
First off, I ain't your man,
you asshole.

51:49.339 --> 51:51.000
You remember my driver Elliot.

51:51.074 --> 51:53.042
Elliot, give this man the envelope.

51:58.381 --> 51:59.678
Ain't you gonna count it?

51:59.749 --> 52:01.649
Nick ain't got the balls to stiff me.

52:01.718 --> 52:04.152
I like that idea you had
about having a bat in the car.

52:04.221 --> 52:06.689
I had my man Elliot
go out and get one.

52:14.397 --> 52:15.489
A red bat!

52:18.602 --> 52:21.127
You don't send a queer to get a bat.

52:21.204 --> 52:23.695
They like these shiny queer things.

52:23.773 --> 52:25.707
What you want... It's not your fault...

52:25.775 --> 52:28.869
What you want is a wood bat.
See, like a Louisville Slugger.

52:28.945 --> 52:30.640
Let me see.
Hold this for me, please. Thank you.

52:30.714 --> 52:33.205
You see, a bat like this,
it messes up a kid's swing.

52:33.283 --> 52:35.945
You gotta take too long of a swipe
across the plate, you see?

52:36.019 --> 52:37.486
He never develops those fast hands

52:37.554 --> 52:39.249
you're gonna need for the majors,
you understand?

52:39.322 --> 52:40.914
I don't know how fast
it's gotta be for my needs,

52:40.991 --> 52:42.219
you know what I'm sayin' to you?

52:42.292 --> 52:44.852
I ain't gonna be up in no majors...
You like that one, huh?

52:46.863 --> 52:48.387
Here's your sandwich.

52:49.733 --> 52:51.030
What's up?

52:54.037 --> 52:55.334
Raji, I think he's chokin'.

52:55.405 --> 52:58.499
You clownin' me?
Joe, are you clownin' with me?

53:06.383 --> 53:11.787
You don't ever disrespect me!

53:11.922 --> 53:12.980
One!

53:13.056 --> 53:14.683
Raji, Raji, Raji.

53:19.296 --> 53:20.490
Damn.

53:21.598 --> 53:22.656
He's dead.

53:22.732 --> 53:23.721
Man!

53:28.638 --> 53:30.401
Talk all that shit, man.

53:32.242 --> 53:33.539
This right here,

53:33.610 --> 53:36.909
this was the cost of doin'... business!

53:41.418 --> 53:43.386
All I want is some appreciation, Elliot.

53:43.453 --> 53:45.512
Chili Palmer don't realize
how hard I work for Linda Moon.

53:45.589 --> 53:47.454
I tried to make her a superstar!

53:47.524 --> 53:50.425
What do I expect in return?
What do I expect in return?

53:50.493 --> 53:54.156
My name on the damn CD so small
you can barely read the damn thing!

53:54.231 --> 53:56.665
And where's that at?
Where's that always at?

53:56.733 --> 54:00.567
On the back, at the bottom.
"Produced by Raji".

54:00.637 --> 54:02.730
In tiny little letters, man!

54:02.806 --> 54:05.240
And I will not let him
take that from me!

54:05.308 --> 54:06.969
Now it's time I got some respect!

54:07.043 --> 54:09.944
I will straight smoke Chili Palmer!

54:17.754 --> 54:20.655
I didn't take you
for a Black Eyed Peas fan.

54:20.724 --> 54:23.557
Well, when they hooked up
with Sergio Mendes, they won me over.

54:24.828 --> 54:27.160
Do you ever think
about becoming a singer?

54:27.230 --> 54:28.219
- A singer?
- Yeah.

54:28.298 --> 54:29.287
Me?

54:29.366 --> 54:30.492
Nah.

54:33.503 --> 54:35.471
But I was a real live
Vegas showgirl once.

54:35.538 --> 54:36.562
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.904
As soon as I was
done washing clothes, I got lucky.

54:38.975 --> 54:41.409
One of those Tropicana revues,
you know?

54:41.478 --> 54:42.467
Thanks.

54:44.180 --> 54:48.742
Chili, I worked so hard starting NTL.

54:48.818 --> 54:51.685
I'm a bit too old to go back to Vegas.

54:51.755 --> 54:53.950
I want you to stop worrying.

54:54.024 --> 54:56.492
We're gonna meet Steven Tyler.

55:01.164 --> 55:03.064
You know, I would've liked
to seen you dance.

55:03.700 --> 55:04.758
Yeah?

55:23.853 --> 55:25.320
Well, you still can.

55:25.388 --> 55:27.151
Yeah? How's that?

55:27.223 --> 55:29.123
Do you dance, Chili?

55:29.192 --> 55:31.660
Me? I'm from Brooklyn.

58:10.420 --> 58:13.253
Okay, so we walk in the Staples Center
with Linda's CD.

58:13.323 --> 58:15.223
- Right.
- And then what?

58:15.291 --> 58:17.020
We put a gun to Steven's head

58:17.093 --> 58:19.653
and say, "Linda's playing
with Aerosmith".

58:22.332 --> 58:24.823
You really like the music business,
don't you, Chil?

58:24.901 --> 58:26.391
Love it.

58:27.670 --> 58:28.728
Me, too.

58:29.572 --> 58:32.973
Tommy and me,
we had a few records on the air,

58:33.042 --> 58:36.068
but I'd just like one time
to turn on the radio

58:36.145 --> 58:41.173
and say, "That's my song.
I produced that".

58:42.218 --> 58:44.686
Somethin', somethin' with soul.

58:44.754 --> 58:46.051
You know?

58:51.227 --> 58:52.694
Your hair's different, huh?

58:55.298 --> 58:56.424
Yeah.

58:58.434 --> 58:59.958
I had it trimmed.

59:03.806 --> 59:05.706
Good night, Chili.

59:08.745 --> 59:10.007
All right.

59:10.079 --> 59:11.512
Drive safe.

59:35.171 --> 59:37.969
That's the pawn shop my friend
from the OC told me about.

59:39.175 --> 59:41.837
It's surrounded by the Feds.
They're watching these Russians.

59:42.545 --> 59:43.671
There he is.

59:45.615 --> 59:48.413
- Oh, yeah.
- His name's Roman Bulkin.

59:49.852 --> 59:50.910
What are you doin'?

59:51.554 --> 59:53.579
Are you crazy?
They know what you look like.

59:53.656 --> 59:55.021
What are you gonna tell 'em?

59:55.091 --> 59:57.719
No more than I have to, if that.

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:05.959
<i>- One twenty-two, George.
- That's 4-8-8 Sunset.</i>

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.559
<i>Subject's approaching
northwest corner.</i>

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:20.908
You've got a lot of balls.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.881
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.480
There's half a dozen
undercover cops outside.

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:29.786
Don't give 'em a reason to come in.

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.451
<i>Nyet!</i>

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:35.158
Now, did you take this picture?

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:39.760
Go to hell, you greasy wop
son of a bitch.

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.600
Now you're the one
that's gonna need protection.

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.339
You go now.

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.044
Is that chest hair real?

01:00:56.305 --> 01:01:02.240
