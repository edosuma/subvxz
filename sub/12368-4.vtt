WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:03.753
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.836 --> 00:05.588
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.672 --> 00:08.425
- DO YOU REMEMBER?
- [muttering]

00:08.508 --> 00:10.093
- YOU KNOW THAT NEIGHBOR
WHO ALWAYS LOOKS AT US

00:10.176 --> 00:11.219
LIKE SHE WANTS TO KILL US?

00:11.302 --> 00:14.889
- YOU MEAN JUDGEY FACE?
- TOO-MANY-GARAGE-SALES LADY?

00:14.973 --> 00:17.767
WE REALLY NEED
TO LEARN THEIR REAL NAMES.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.227
- IT'S JUDGEY FACE.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.937
SHE'S CHASING AFTER ME,
AND SHE'S ARMED.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.689
- [laughs]
OH, JOY, COME ON.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.774
OUR NEIGHBORS ARE VERY SWEET.
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT SHE'S--

00:24.858 --> 00:27.444
[pounding on door]
- I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.280
- OH, SHE'S GOT
A JUDGEY VOICE TOO.

00:32.698 --> 00:33.783
- WHERE IS SHE?

00:33.867 --> 00:34.784
- WHO?

00:34.868 --> 00:35.994
- THE ONE WITH THE LEGS.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.288
- I'M RIGHT HERE.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.831
- YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.624
THAT ONE.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.792
- PLEASE...

00:42.876 --> 00:44.669
WHAT DID I EVEN DO?

00:44.753 --> 00:46.421
- YOU DROPPED YOUR MAIL,
BENT OVER, AND PICKED IT UP.

00:46.504 --> 00:47.672
- YES?

00:47.756 --> 00:49.924
- IN THOSE SHORTS.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.093
DON'T YOU KNOW THERE ARE
CHILDREN IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

00:52.177 --> 00:54.846
CHILDREN WHOSE FATHERS
WATER THE SAME PATCH OF GRASS

00:54.929 --> 00:56.306
FOR 45 MINUTES,

00:56.389 --> 00:59.350
WAITING FOR YOU TO COME
AND PICK UP YOUR MAIL.

00:59.434 --> 01:04.022
IT'S THE ONLY PART
OF MY LAWN THAT'S GREEN.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.857
- EXCUSE ME,
BUT I DON'T THINK JOY MEANT--

01:05.940 --> 01:08.276
- NO, IT'S NOT JUST HER!
IT'S ALL OF YOU!

01:08.359 --> 01:10.987
YOU MOVE INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
WITH YOUR HOLLYWOOD HAIR

01:11.070 --> 01:13.907
AND YOUR GORGEOUS CLOTHES
THAT NEVER HAVE SLEEVES.

01:17.076 --> 01:19.370
IT'S NO WONDER
ALL OUR HUSBANDS STARE.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.332
- OH, DO THEY REALLY?

01:22.415 --> 01:25.835
- I HAVEN'T SHOWN
MY UPPER ARMS SINCE 1998,

01:25.919 --> 01:27.837
AND YOU KNOW
HOW HOT IT GETS IN AUGUST.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.380
- UNDERSTOOD.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.299
FROM NOW ON,
WE WILL COVER OUR ARMS.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.051
- NO, NO,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO CHANGE.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.928
I WANT YOU TO CHANGE ME.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.055
MAKE ME MORE LIKE YOU.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.807
- OH, YOU MEAN
LIKE A MAKEOVER?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.350
- OH, WE LOVE MAKEOVERS.

01:40.433 --> 01:44.145
- FIRST MAKEOVER RULE--
NO SHARP ACCESSORIES.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.022
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING
I WOULD NOT CHANGE?

01:46.105 --> 01:48.858
YOUR PERFUME.
IT'S SO...

01:48.942 --> 01:50.527
WHOLESOME.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.696
- IT'S BACON
AND MAPLE SYRUP.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.699
BUT I WANT TO CHANGE.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.536
I WANT MY HUSBAND TO PIN ME UP
AGAINST THAT SHOWER WALL

01:59.619 --> 02:03.540
LIKE HE USED TO.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.916
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
WE BOTH CAN'T FIT IN THERE

02:04.999 --> 02:08.044
TOGETHER ANYMORE.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.503
- WE CAN HANDLE IT.

02:09.586 --> 02:11.756
WE'VE DONE THIS FOR
LOTS OF FRIENDS BACK IN L.A.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.050
- REMEMBER WHEN
ANGELINA JOLIE WAS SO SKINNY,

02:14.133 --> 02:15.051
PEOPLE THOUGHT
SHE WAS GOING TO DIE?

02:15.134 --> 02:17.428
THAT WAS US.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.265
- OH, I WISH WE COULD GET
STARTED RIGHT AWAY.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.724
BUT I'M SURE
THE TWINS' SWINGS

02:21.808 --> 02:23.560
HAVE SLOWED
ALL THE WAY DOWN BY NOW.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.019
HOW'S TOMORROW MORNING?

02:25.103 --> 02:26.229
- SURE.
- FANTASTIC.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.730
- GREAT.
- WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.107
- SEE YOU THEN.
- OKAY, BYE-BYE.

02:29.190 --> 02:32.402
- OH.
- OUR FIRST CLEVELAND MAKEOVER.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.404
- WELL, THIS CITY
HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR US.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.406
I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT WE GAVE BACK.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.367
- WE REALLY ARE WONDERFUL,
AREN'T WE?

02:39.450 --> 02:41.411
- SO WHERE SHOULD WE BEGIN?

02:41.494 --> 02:43.121
- WELL, HER CLOTHES
FOR STARTERS.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.415
EVERYTHING SHE WAS WEARING
WAS CHOSEN FOR COMFORT

02:45.498 --> 02:48.585
OR SOME OTHER
RIDICULOUS REASON.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.961
[engine revs]

02:50.044 --> 02:54.257
- JOY, DID YOU PISS OFF
A BIKER GANG, TOO?

02:54.340 --> 02:56.634
- ROY TOOK ME ON A MOTORCYCLE.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.430
- AND WE GOT HERE
ON A MOTORCYCLE I TOOK ELKA ON.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.265
- ROY, ELKA,
YOU GUYS ARE YELLING.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.434
I-I THINK THE MOTORCYCLE
AFFECTED YOUR HEARING.

03:04.517 --> 03:08.771
- OH, NO, I LET ROY
DO THE STEERING.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.399
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
HOW LOUD THAT ENGINE IS.

03:11.482 --> 03:14.235
- UM, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY
OUR GOOD-BYES ON THE PORCH?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.945
- I HEARD "PORCH."

03:16.029 --> 03:17.739
OH, I WAS RIGHT.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.365
[sighs]

03:19.449 --> 03:23.286
- I DIDN'T WANT THEM
TO HEAR US.

03:23.369 --> 03:26.915
- I DIDN'T WANT THEM
NEAR US EITHER.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.499
LET'S MAKE OUT.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.836
- NOW I WISH
I COULDN'T HEAR.

03:41.679 --> 03:44.307
{\an8}- THE HAIR AND MAKEUP
DEPARTMENTS ARE READY.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.351
{\an8}- DIET AND CULTURE IS READY.

03:46.434 --> 03:50.647
{\an8}- EXERCISE AND CONSTRUCTIVE
SELF-LOATHING IS READY.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.775
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU CHARGING
FOR THIS MAKEOVER ANYWAY?

03:53.858 --> 03:54.984
{\an8}- IT'S FREE.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.196
{\an8}- STILL SEEMS PRICEY.

03:58.279 --> 04:02.825
{\an7}- SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT WITH ROY,
YOUR REBEL WITHOUT A PROSTATE?

04:04.702 --> 04:06.829
{\an8}- REBEL IS RIGHT.

04:06.913 --> 04:10.291
{\an8}I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT A WILD MAN HE IS.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.668
{\an8}- ROY?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.461
{\an8}- HE SEES A MOTORCYCLE,
WE HAVE TO RENT ONE.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.296
{\an8}HE SEES A PET STORE,

04:15.380 --> 04:19.300
{\an8}WE HAVE TO WEAR THE BIGGEST
SNAKE ON OUR SHOULDERS.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.678
{\an8}- BETTER WATCH OUT
FOR TATTOO PARLORS.

04:21.761 --> 04:25.640
{\an8}- TOO LATE.
I'M SITTING ON A BUTTERFLY.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.314
{\an8}ROY'S YOUNGER THAN I AM.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.402
{\an8}I'M '40s SINATRA,
HE'S '50s SINATRA...

04:37.485 --> 04:39.696
{\an8}BUT HE THINKS
WE'RE THE SAME AGE.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.656
{\an8}- AND HE MUST KEEP
THINKING THAT.

04:41.739 --> 04:42.907
{\an8}NOW, LUCKY FOR YOU,

04:42.991 --> 04:44.659
{\an8}ALL THREE OF US
HAVE DATED YOUNGER MEN

04:44.742 --> 04:46.244
{\an8}SINCE MOVING TO CLEVELAND,

04:46.327 --> 04:48.371
{\an8}AND THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON
WE'VE LEARNED

04:48.454 --> 04:49.956
{\an8}IS TO BE TOTALLY DISHONEST.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.834
{\an8}- YES.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.044
{\an8}YOU HAVE TO LIE ABOUT YOUR AGE,
YOUR WEIGHT.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.046
{\an8}- YOUR ENERGY LEVEL,
ALL OF IT.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.589
{\an8}AND YOU HAVE TO BE UP
FOR ANYTHING.

04:58.673 --> 05:02.552
{\an8}AND SOMETIMES DOWN FOR STUFF.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.387
{\an8}- YOU MEAN I HAVE TO LIE
ABOUT EVERYTHING?

05:04.470 --> 05:05.388
{\an8}- YES.
- YES.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.223
{\an8}BUT WHEN YOU LIE
ABOUT YOUR AGE, BE CAREFUL.

05:07.306 --> 05:09.183
{\an8}MAKE YOUR BIRTH YEAR
A NICE, ROUND NUMBER

05:09.267 --> 05:11.352
{\an8}OR THE MATH IS UNBEARABLE.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.229
- WELL, FOR YOU MAYBE,

05:13.312 --> 05:17.942
BUT I CAN ADD OR SUBTRACT
ANYTHING FROM 1963.

05:18.026 --> 05:21.779
BUT EVERYONE CALLS
MARILU HENNER THE GENIUS.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.114
- SO...

05:23.197 --> 05:26.409
I COULD BE BORN IN...1935.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.536
- DEPENDS.
WHEN DID YOU TURN 18?

05:28.619 --> 05:29.746
- OH...

05:29.829 --> 05:32.582
- TOO SLOW.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.876
- IT TAKES PRACTICE
TO REALLY DEEP DOWN

05:34.959 --> 05:36.252
KNOW YOUR NEW FAKE AGE,

05:36.335 --> 05:38.129
BUT IT'S COMPLETELY WORTH IT.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.922
- BECAUSE AFTER A WHILE,

05:40.006 --> 05:42.425
YOU ACTUALLY START
TO FEEL THAT AGE.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.844
- YOU MEAN I COULD FEEL
LIKE I'M IN MY 70s AGAIN?

05:44.927 --> 05:46.971
- YES.

05:47.055 --> 05:50.933
- [laughing]
OH, THAT WOULD BE RIGHTEOUS.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.772
- LOOK OUT, WORLD.
HERE COMES OUT ELKA AT 78.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.858
- NOT TILL MY NEXT BIRTHDAY.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.401
- NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT.

06:00.485 --> 06:04.947
- LOOK AT US, DOING GOOD,
GETTING TO KNOW OUR NEIGHBORS.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.282
[pounding on door]

06:06.365 --> 06:09.786
THAT MUST BE JUDGEY FACE.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.329
- PAM AND SALLY WANT IN.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.331
THEIR HUSBANDS
HAVE BEEN GAWKING AT YOU TOO.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.292
- GAWKING, HONESTLY?
AT WHICH ONE OF US?

06:16.375 --> 06:18.586
- PLEASE, COME ON IN.
HI, I'M MELANIE.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.171
- I'M PAM.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.423
YOU CAME TO ONE
OF MY GARAGE SALES, REMEMBER?

06:22.507 --> 06:26.135
BUT YOU DIDN'T COME BACK TO ANY
OF MY OTHER GARAGE SALES.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.388
- YEAH, WE CALL YOU
"GOES TO ONE GARAGE SALE."

06:33.184 --> 06:34.102
- WAIT A MINUTE.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.353
JOY'S THE ONE WITH THE LEGS,

06:35.436 --> 06:39.315
AND I'M ONLY
"GOES TO ONE GARAGE SALE"?

06:39.398 --> 06:40.733
- I'M SALLY,

06:40.817 --> 06:44.153
AND I WANT TO FIT
INTO MY SHORT SHORTS.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.988
- THAT MIGHT TAKE
A LITTLE "TIME TIME."

06:46.072 --> 06:48.324
[laughs]

06:51.869 --> 06:53.996
OKAY, BEFORES...

06:54.080 --> 06:56.833
WELCOME TO YOUR L.A. MAKEOVER.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.334
NOW, TODAY'S TOPIC IS FOOD.

06:58.417 --> 07:01.337
WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
TO FOOD? KIM?

07:01.420 --> 07:03.506
- I LOVE FOOD.
- ME TOO.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.509
- THE ONLY DREAMS
I EVER REMEMBER ARE OF FOOD.

07:06.592 --> 07:10.012
ONE NIGHT I DREAMED THAT MY
HUSBAND WAS MADE OF CHOCOLATE.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.848
THEN HIS SNORING WOKE ME UP.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.684
SO I ATE A BAG OF OREOS
IN THE BATHROOM.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.144
- WELL, YOU'RE GOING
TO LOVE THIS DIET,

07:16.227 --> 07:17.687
BECAUSE IT LETS YOU
LOVE FOOD,

07:17.770 --> 07:20.481
OBSESS OVER IT, DREAM ABOUT IT,
EVEN PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.193
YOU JUST CAN'T SWALLOW IT.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.154
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WE CAN'T EAT?

07:26.237 --> 07:28.573
- WELL, THINK OF FOOD
AS A BAD BOYFRIEND.

07:28.656 --> 07:32.368
IT ONLY WANTS YOU TO LOVE IT
SO IT CAN SCREW YOU.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.453
- LET'S TALK
ABOUT MEAL PLANNING.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.039
NOW, WHAT IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.583
- BREAKFAST?
- EXACTLY.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.752
WHICH IS WHY
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO SKIP IT.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.715
- FOR LUNCH,
YOU CAN HAVE A SALAD.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.717
- COBB SALAD?
STEAK SALAD?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.510
- MEXICAN SALAD
WITH THE EDIBLE BOWL?

07:49.594 --> 07:51.053
- YOU CAN'T
JUST TAKE AN ENTIRE MEAL

07:51.137 --> 07:55.558
AND SLAP THE WORD
"SALAD" ON IT.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.394
AND IF YOU MAKE IT THROUGH
THE ENTIRE DAY WITHOUT EATING,

07:58.477 --> 08:01.731
CONGRATULATIONS--
YOU CAN HAVE ONE LARGE MARTINI.

08:01.814 --> 08:05.526
- OR SOME VEGGIES AND FISH
IF YOU'RE IN A.A.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.778
- I READ SOMEWHERE
THAT IF YOU DON'T EAT ENOUGH,

08:07.862 --> 08:09.572
YOUR BRAIN STARTS
TO EAT ITSELF.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.783
- WHICH IS MORE LOST WEIGHT.

08:12.867 --> 08:13.910
OKAY.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.456
- AFTER I GOT
OUT OF THE ARMY,

08:18.539 --> 08:20.416
I HITCHHIKED AROUND
FOR A WHILE--

08:20.499 --> 08:23.753
DANGEROUS STUFF,
EVEN FOR 1952.

08:23.836 --> 08:27.590
- 17.
I WAS 17 IN 1952.

08:27.673 --> 08:28.758
- [chuckles]

08:28.841 --> 08:30.760
I LIKE THE ADVENTURE
OF THE ROAD.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.471
I DIDN'T SETTLE DOWN
IN ONCE PLACE UNTIL 1955.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.557
- 20.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.808
- AND I CAME
TO CLEVELAND IN '57.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.102
- 22.
- [chuckles]

08:41.187 --> 08:42.855
SO...

08:42.938 --> 08:44.148
WHAT SHOULD WE DO NEXT?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.609
- YOU KNOW ME.
I'M UP FOR ANYTHING.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.444
- OH, I NOTICED THAT.

08:48.527 --> 08:50.321
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TO TALK YOU INTO RIDING

08:50.404 --> 08:52.949
THAT BACKWARD
ROLLER COASTER WITH ME.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.326
- [sarcastically]
WASN'T THAT FUN?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.331
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A THRILL SEEKER.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.291
NOW I KNOW FOR SURE.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.669
- TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE.
- YEAH.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.505
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING CRAZY.

09:07.588 --> 09:08.965
- LIKE WHAT?

09:09.048 --> 09:10.758
- HOW ABOUT SKYDIVING?

09:10.841 --> 09:13.094
- OH, I'M UP...

09:13.177 --> 09:16.013
AND DOWN FOR THAT.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.610
- GREAT JOB, LADIES,

09:29.694 --> 09:32.280
ESPECIALLY WHOEVER WAS CRYING
ON THE WAY UP THAT LAST HILL.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.949
- THANK YOU.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.993
- ALL RIGHT,
TIME FOR OUR WEIGH-IN.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.412
- PAM, YOU'RE FIRST.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.038
- I LOST FOUR POUNDS.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.164
[all cheering]

09:42.248 --> 09:44.500
- CARE TO MAKE A DECLARATION?

09:44.583 --> 09:46.669
- WELL, TO TELL THE TRUTH,
MY ARMS ARE SO SORE,

09:46.752 --> 09:48.671
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO HUG
MY KIDS ALL WEEK.

09:48.754 --> 09:52.591
- MARVELOUS.
- FANTASTIC.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.844
- I'M NEXT.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.513
- TWO POUNDS.
DECLARATION?

09:57.596 --> 09:59.682
- I DID MY HAIR AND MAKEUP
THE WAY THAT JOY TAUGHT ME,

09:59.765 --> 10:01.851
WHICH MADE ME A COUPLE OF HOURS
LATE FOR WORK.

10:01.934 --> 10:05.479
SO A FEW 911 CALLS
DID GO UNANSWERED.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.690
BUT THE CUTE STARBUCKS GUY
WINKED AT ME

10:07.773 --> 10:09.108
AND GAVE ME A FREE PASTRY,

10:09.191 --> 10:11.319
WHICH I, OF COURSE,
CHEWED AND SPIT OUT.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.327
- YOU LOST FIVE POUNDS.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

10:19.410 --> 10:20.244
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.872
SHAKY, CRANKY.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.041
- I THINK THE WORD
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

10:25.124 --> 10:28.085
IS "HAPPY," HUH?

10:28.169 --> 10:30.713
OH, OH.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.551
NOW, UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY LOSE
THE WEIGHT,

10:35.634 --> 10:37.720
EVERYONE LOOKS THINNER
IN SIX-INCH HEELS.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.723
- NOW, PRACTICE WALKING AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD

10:40.806 --> 10:42.350
AND PRETEND
YOU'RE AS COMFORTABLE

10:42.433 --> 10:46.270
AS YOU WERE IN THOSE CROCS
WE JUST TOOK AWAY FROM YOU.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.397
- I CAN'T FEEL
MY FEET IN THESE.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.400
- THE BLUER THE TOE,
THE SWEETER THE SHOE.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.153
- EVERYONE'S
GOING TO STARE AT US.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.572
- OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:56.655 --> 10:57.907
- THERE YOU GO.
YOU'RE DOING IT.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.075
YOU ARE DOING IT.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.244
[thud]
OOH, SALLY'S DOWN.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.538
AND SHE'S BACK UP.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.791
- WHAT A TRIUMPH.

11:06.874 --> 11:09.752
- WE ARE
LITERALLY CHANGING LIVES.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.089
- ROY AND I
ARE GOING SKYDIVING TOMORROW.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.840
- SKYDIVING?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.592
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS--

11:16.675 --> 11:19.261
BOTH FOR YOUR REAL
AND FAKE AGES.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.098
- AND I LIED ABOUT MY WEIGHT

11:22.181 --> 11:24.433
ON ALL THE FORMS.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.935
- BY HOW MUCH?

11:26.018 --> 11:27.937
- AS MUCH AS YOU TOLD ME TO.

11:28.020 --> 11:32.108
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.984
- YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF THIS.

11:34.068 --> 11:37.780
- ALL RIGHT, I-I HAVE
SOME EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.116
YOU NEED TO LOCK YOURSELF
IN YOUR TRAILER

11:40.199 --> 11:42.952
AND DEMAND A STUNT DOUBLE.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.788
- NO, YOU NEED A YOUNG-ISH
EXCUSE TO GET OUT OF IT.

11:45.871 --> 11:48.916
UH, YOU'RE WASTED
FROM DOING JELL-O SHOTS.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.793
- OR YOU GOT YOUR PERIOD.

11:55.881 --> 11:59.301
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LISTENED TO YOU THREE.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.471
YOU'D THINK
I WOULD'VE LEARNED SOMETHING

12:02.555 --> 12:06.642
AFTER 77 YEARS
ON THIS EARTH.

12:06.725 --> 12:09.728
WOW.
THAT IS FUN TO SAY.

12:13.732 --> 12:17.027
ROY, I ADMIT IT.
I'M SCARED.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.947
BUT YOU WERE NERVOUS
ON YOUR FIRST JUMP, RIGHT?

12:20.030 --> 12:21.907
- I SURE AM.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.159
- WHAT?

12:23.242 --> 12:25.286
- I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.
I LIED TO YOU.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.163
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.458
- BUT YOU SAID YOU WERE
A PARATROOPER IN KOREA.

12:30.541 --> 12:34.003
- YES, THAT WAS THE LIE.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.172
- SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.506
- NO.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.926
LET ME UNHOOK
THE TANDEM LINE.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.386
- THAT'S THE SAFETY--

12:42.470 --> 12:44.889
[both screaming]

12:48.267 --> 12:51.187
- AND THAT'S THE LAST SET
OF KEGEL EXERCISES FOR TODAY.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.731
[all exhale deeply]

12:53.814 --> 12:55.316
- QUICK,
GET THESE AWAY FROM ME.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.525
I'M HAVING A RELAPSE.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.152
- WHAT IS THAT?

12:58.235 --> 12:59.695
- THE WALKING TACO.

12:59.778 --> 13:00.905
I CAN'T RESIST THEM.

13:00.988 --> 13:04.033
IT'S CHILI,
CHEESE, SOUR CREAM

13:04.116 --> 13:08.746
ALL FLOATING ON A SALTY BED
OF CRUSHED FRITO GOODNESS.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.707
- I PUT RAISINS IN MINE.

13:11.790 --> 13:15.878
THEN IT'S A SALAD.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.630
- HOW MANY CALORIES IS THAT?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.091
- [sniffs]

13:21.175 --> 13:24.345
4,780 CALORIES.

13:24.428 --> 13:28.349
I'M THE BEAUTIFUL MIND
OF VANITY MATH.

13:28.432 --> 13:30.726
- CAN I HAVE IT BACK?
- OF COURSE NOT.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.394
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
EVEN BROUGHT IT HERE.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.897
YOU SHOULD HAVE THROWN IT AWAY
AT YOUR HOUSE.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.440
- AT MY HOUSE,
I WOULD HAVE JUST EATEN IT

13:36.524 --> 13:37.858
OUT OF THE TRASH...

13:37.942 --> 13:39.944
LIKE I WANT TO DO NOW.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.403
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.113
- [sighs]
- OH.

13:43.197 --> 13:48.118
♪ HUSH, LITTLE JUDGEY FACE,
DON'T YOU CRY ♪

13:52.164 --> 13:54.625
- I ONLY LIED TO MAKE MYSELF
SEEM MORE EXCITING.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.670
- BUT I'M NO THRILL SEEKER.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.923
I ONLY LIED ABOUT THAT
BECAUSE I LIED ABOUT MY--

14:01.006 --> 14:02.883
- OH!
- AAH!

14:05.344 --> 14:08.430
[both sigh]

14:08.514 --> 14:10.307
- OH.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.476
- OH, THIS IS GORGEOUS.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.437
- OH, IT IS.

14:17.856 --> 14:20.317
- SO WHAT DID YOU LIE ABOUT?

14:20.401 --> 14:23.237
- UH, IN GOOD TIME.

14:23.320 --> 14:27.324
LET'S JUST ENJOY THE VIEW.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.952
- ARE WE FLOATING OFF COURSE?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.788
- WE'RE HEADING FOR LAKE ERIE.

14:32.871 --> 14:34.665
- THEY SAID WITH
OUR COMBINED WEIGHT,

14:34.748 --> 14:38.085
WE'D DRIFT RIGHT
ONTO THE FIELD.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.087
- ABOUT THAT...

14:40.170 --> 14:44.008
LOVELY DAY FOR A SWIM,
ISN'T IT?

14:48.053 --> 14:51.473
- AGING GRACEFULLY
IS A MYTH.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.476
NATURE IS ONLY YOUR FRIEND
UNTIL YOU'RE 25,

14:54.560 --> 14:56.478
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO TURN
TO THE UNNATURAL--

14:56.562 --> 14:59.106
BOTOX, FILLERS, AND LASERS.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.150
- I'VE HEARD LASERS
ARE PAINFUL.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.694
- VICTORIA WILL COVER
PAIN KILLING TOMORROW.

15:03.777 --> 15:07.489
- DON'T MISS IT,
AND DON'T PLAN ON DRIVING HOME.

15:07.573 --> 15:11.285
- LASER TREATMENTS MAKE
YOUR SKIN LOOK YEARS YOUNGER.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.954
HERE'S HOW.

15:14.038 --> 15:18.500
IMAGINE THIS MARSHMALLOW
IS YOUR SAD, WRINKLY FACE.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.212
NOW HERE COMES
THE HELPFUL LASER.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.634
OF COURSE IT LOOKS BURNT
AND BLISTERY NOW,

15:26.717 --> 15:28.636
BUT WHEN THE CRUST PEELS OFF,

15:28.719 --> 15:31.639
IT'S ALL CREAMY
AND SMOOTH UNDERNEATH.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.807
ANY QUESTIONS?

15:33.891 --> 15:37.144
NO, YOU CAN'T EAT IT.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.730
[knock on door]

15:42.691 --> 15:44.526
- JERRY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:44.610 --> 15:48.405
- I KNEW
YOU WEREN'T SCRAPBOOKING.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.991
- ARE YOU THE LUCKY HUSBANDS?
PLEASE COME IN.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.370
- AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK
OF YOUR FABULOUS NEW WIVES.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.665
- WE WANT OUR OLD WIVES BACK.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.042
- YEAH, OUR OLD WIVES
WEREN'T HUNGRY AND CRANKY.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.836
- AND THEY DIDN'T TAKE SO LONG
TO GET READY.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.089
- BUT LOOK AT THE RESULTS.
THEY'RE SO HOT.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.507
HOW CAN YOU STAND IT?

16:06.590 --> 16:08.175
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SEX?

16:08.258 --> 16:12.721
BECAUSE MY WIFE SAID THAT'S OVER
UNTIL SHE GETS ABS.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.183
- MY WIFE SAYS NOBODY CAN HAVE
ABS AND KIDS AT THE SAME TIME.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.435
- SHE SAYS GWEN STEFANI DOES.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.729
- IS THAT
THE NEW KINDERGARTEN TEACHER?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.773
- GENTLEMEN, ARE YOU LISTENING
TO YOURSELVES?

16:22.856 --> 16:25.067
NOW, YOUR WIVES
DIDN'T JUST DO THIS FOR YOU.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.904
THEY ALSO DID IT FOR THEMSELVES,
FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL DIGNITY.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.948
- PERSONAL DIGNITY?

16:31.031 --> 16:33.283
WELL, WE WERE ALWAYS DOING IT
FOR OUR HUSBANDS.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.577
- I THINK THIS IS ROMANTIC.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.913
THE GUYS JUST WANT THEIR WIVES
TO BE THEMSELVES.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.581
- IS THAT TRUE, JERRY?

16:39.665 --> 16:41.375
DID YOU REALLY LIKE ME
THE WAY I WAS?

16:41.458 --> 16:42.626
- OF COURSE.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.586
- BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS
STARING AT THEM.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.754
- JUST TO STARE.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.758
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE MARRIED TO THEM.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.387
- OH, GOD, CAN YOU IMAGINE?
[laughter]

16:53.470 --> 16:57.099
- THAT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.476
- NEW KIM
DOESN'T EVEN SMELL RIGHT.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.270
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT...

17:01.353 --> 17:03.939
[sniffs]
BACON-Y FRESHNESS.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.607
- OH, JER.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.900
- COME ON, SALLY.

17:06.983 --> 17:09.444
LET'S GET HOME
AND BURN THOSE SHORT SHORTS.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.155
- LET'S GO, BABY.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.156
- THANKS, YOU GUYS.
- FOR WHAT?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.284
- WELL,
ALL WE WANTED TO KNOW

17:15.367 --> 17:16.617
WAS THAT OUR HUSBANDS
DIDN'T WANT YOU.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.288
AND WE GOT THAT.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.749
- WHO NEEDS A MAKEOVER NOW?

17:23.709 --> 17:25.169
I'M SORRY
IF THAT CAME OFF MEAN.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.503
I'M VERY HUNGRY.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.802
- APPARENTLY THEY THINK
WE ARE GORGEOUS NIGHTMARES.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.471
- THEY DIDN'T SAY "GORGEOUS."

17:35.554 --> 17:37.139
- WELL, IT WAS IMPLIED.

17:37.222 --> 17:41.101
- WELL, I THINK IT'S SWEET
HOW MUCH THEY LOVE THEIR WIVES.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.061
- THEY DID SEEM HAPPY.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.980
- WELL, THEY'RE HAPPY
BECAUSE THEY'RE BACK

17:45.063 --> 17:48.108
WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE
YOU HENS PECKED AT THEM.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.860
- ELKA, YOU DIDN'T DIE.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.111
- NOT SO FAST.

17:51.195 --> 17:54.656
SHE COULD
JUST BE BACK TO HAUNT US.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.825
- I'M ALIVE.
[chuckles]

17:56.909 --> 17:59.453
AND I TOLD ROY
THE TRUTH ABOUT EVERYTHING.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.330
- OH, BIG MISTAKE.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.831
- HE'S OKAY WITH IT.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.375
- WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MEN?

18:05.459 --> 18:08.003
HAVE STANDARDS SUNK SO LOW

18:08.086 --> 18:11.965
THAT MEN ARE NOW ACCEPTING WOMEN
AS THEY ARE?

18:12.049 --> 18:14.218
- YOU GIRLS SHOULD ACCEPT
THE WAY YOU ARE.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.428
YOU SHOULD STOP LYING
ABOUT YOUR AGE,

18:16.512 --> 18:19.681
AND YOU SHOULD EAT.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.809
- DO YOU THINK
WE'RE NIGHTMARES, TOO?

18:21.892 --> 18:25.687
- CAN I GO ONE AT A TIME?

18:25.771 --> 18:29.358
OH, IT'S NO FUN KICKING YOU
WHEN YOU'RE DOWN.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.027
I'LL WAIT
TILL TOMORROW MORNING.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.154
- MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.698
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOSEN UP
OUR ROUTINES A LITTLE.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.702
- ARE YOU SAYING,
"WHEN IN CLEVELAND"...

18:40.786 --> 18:43.205
- "EAT A BIT MORE"?

18:43.288 --> 18:45.874
- I SMELL SOMETHING
FROM OUR KITCHEN.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.710
- IT'S THE WALKING TACO.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.506
AND IT'S NOT QUITE
IN OUR KITCHEN.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.386
THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.222
- IT'S STILL IN THE BAG.

19:00.305 --> 19:03.100
- JUST GRAB IT ALREADY BEFORE
THE CHEESE STOPS BUBBLING.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.569
- SO THIS IS WHAT
HAPPINESS FEELS LIKE.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.028
- I FEEL SO WARM,

19:15.112 --> 19:19.199
LIKE MY INSIDES
ARE GIVING ME A HUG.

19:19.283 --> 19:22.703
-<i> TE AMO,</i> WALKING TACO.
<i>TE AMO.</i>

19:24.288 --> 19:27.958
- [inhales deeply]
I'M UNBUTTONING MY PANTS...

19:28.041 --> 19:29.793
LIKE AN ANIMAL...

19:29.877 --> 19:32.588
AND LOVING IT.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.675
- FEEL MY CHILI BUMP.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.177
- IT IS SO FREEING NOT STRESSING
ABOUT WHAT WE EAT.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.596
WE'RE LOOSENING UP.
- HMM.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.806
- MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.605
- YEAH, BUT ISN'T THE LESSON...
"DON'T CHANGE"?

19:49.688 --> 19:52.232
I-I MEAN, WHEN WE WERE IN L.A.,
WE WERE--

19:52.316 --> 19:54.526
WE WERE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE,
BUT WE CAME HERE,

19:54.610 --> 19:56.236
AND THEN WE WERE SPECIAL,

19:56.320 --> 19:57.654
AND IF WE MAKE
EVERYONE ELSE LIKE US

19:57.738 --> 20:00.949
OR--OR WE TRY
TO BE LIKE THEM, THEN...

20:01.033 --> 20:04.620
THE SPELL IS BROKEN.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.330
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:06.413 --> 20:09.917
THEY'RE HAPPY BEING THEMSELVES.
WE'RE HAPPY BEING OURSELVES.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.920
WE JUST NEED TO FIND MEN
WHO LIKE US THE WAY WE ARE.

20:13.003 --> 20:16.465
MEN WHOSE DREAM
IT IS TO MARRY NIGHTMARES.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.176
- I'M BUTTONING.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.802
- YEAH, WE NEED TO WORK OFF
THESE CALORIES FAST.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.429
WE NEED TO TAKE A POWER RUN.

20:22.512 --> 20:25.849
- I'M NOT RUNNING ANYWHERE
WITH THIS BELLY FULL OF CHILI.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.478
- SO WHY DID WE POUR THAT WHOLE
BAG OF MARSHMALLOWS ON TOP?

20:29.561 --> 20:32.689
- THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT A SALAD.
