00:00.000 --> 00:03.608
[door opens]

00:03.641 --> 00:05.779
Merry Christmas.

00:05.811 --> 00:07.416
Merry Christmas.
No!

00:07.448 --> 00:09.619
Why are you--
why did you bring that here?

00:09.652 --> 00:10.788
Don't worry.
She's dead.

00:10.822 --> 00:12.658
Oh, wait...

00:12.692 --> 00:13.761
He's dead.

00:13.794 --> 00:16.466
Dwight, what--uhh!

00:16.500 --> 00:17.802
I accidentally ran over it.

00:17.836 --> 00:19.073
It's a Christmas miracle.

00:19.107 --> 00:20.075
Well, get it out of here.

00:20.109 --> 00:22.113
(Dwight)
Relax, okay?

00:22.146 --> 00:23.281
And because
this is Christmas,

00:23.314 --> 00:24.749
I am going
to roast this goose

00:24.783 --> 00:28.158
and prepare it with
a wild rice dressing.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.795
Do we have any cayenne pepper
in the kitchen?

00:30.828 --> 00:32.798
Merry Christmas, Dwight.

00:32.833 --> 00:33.800
Jim.

00:33.835 --> 00:35.205
Wow.
What have we got here?

00:35.239 --> 00:36.241
What does it look like?

00:36.274 --> 00:37.875
Dead goose.

00:37.908 --> 00:39.247
And circle
gets the square.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.615
All right.

00:40.649 --> 00:41.851
So can you watch this?

00:41.883 --> 00:42.853
I'm gonna get
my carving knife

00:42.885 --> 00:44.157
out of the trunk.

00:44.190 --> 00:45.524
Ah, Dwight,
we talked about this.

00:45.558 --> 00:47.462
No, Toby,
this is different.

00:47.495 --> 00:48.798
He is already dead.

00:48.830 --> 00:52.173
Once, I brought in a duck
to prepare for lunch.

00:52.206 --> 00:53.840
And people got upset.

00:53.875 --> 00:54.710
[scoffs]

00:54.743 --> 00:56.913
Apparently, they
got attached to the duck

00:56.946 --> 00:58.651
and didn't want
to see it killed.

00:58.685 --> 01:00.121
He was already dead.

01:00.121 --> 01:02.193
And we Schrutes use
every part of the goose.

01:02.226 --> 01:05.731
The meat has a delicious,
smoky, rich flavor.

01:05.765 --> 01:07.469
Plus, you can use
the molten goose grease

01:07.503 --> 01:08.837
and save it
in the refrigerator.

01:08.871 --> 01:09.707
Thus saving you
a trip to the store

01:09.739 --> 01:11.544
for a can
of expensive goose grease.

01:11.576 --> 01:13.615
Oh, win-win.

01:13.648 --> 01:15.818
Exactly.
Thank you, Jim.

01:15.851 --> 01:16.954
I like goose.
And it's already dead.

01:16.986 --> 01:18.458
Is it so crazy
if we eat it?

01:18.490 --> 01:19.960
That is crazy.
It's crazy.

01:19.992 --> 01:22.333
(Toby)
Dwight, you cannot
keep that here.

01:22.365 --> 01:23.901
Okay, that is ridiculous.

01:23.934 --> 01:25.905
And totally against
the spirit of Christmas.

01:25.938 --> 01:27.575
Come on, Dwight.

01:27.608 --> 01:31.417
We went over this, like,
for a half an hour.

01:31.450 --> 01:32.886
[whispering]
It's Christmas, Toby.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.991
It's a dead animal
in our office, you can't--

01:36.024 --> 01:37.463
Toby...

01:37.495 --> 01:38.497
I'm sorry.

01:38.530 --> 01:39.532
[exhales]

01:39.566 --> 01:40.969
Please?

01:41.001 --> 01:42.706
Please?

01:46.011 --> 01:49.320
Clean it in your car.

01:49.353 --> 01:51.324
I would like it
off my desk.

01:51.357 --> 01:53.728
Oh, Pam.
Take a chill pill.

01:53.761 --> 01:56.734
[cheerful music]

01:56.767 --> 02:04.849
*

02:25.892 --> 02:27.695
* Deck the halls

02:27.728 --> 02:30.501
* With boughs of holly

02:30.535 --> 02:31.736
* Fa la la la la

02:31.770 --> 02:33.105
* La la la la

02:33.138 --> 02:35.109
* 'Tis... *

02:35.142 --> 02:36.646
Ah, [bleep]!

02:36.680 --> 02:38.048
Hey!

02:38.083 --> 02:39.987
I would like

02:40.020 --> 02:41.690
a nice slice

02:41.723 --> 02:43.660
of Christmas Pam.

02:43.694 --> 02:45.030
Side of candy Pams.

02:45.062 --> 02:46.967
And perhaps...

02:47.001 --> 02:49.137
some Pam chops.

02:49.171 --> 02:50.909
Can I help you, Michael?
With mint.

02:50.942 --> 02:53.548
I'm looking for
the toy drive box.

02:53.580 --> 02:54.550
It's behind you.

02:54.582 --> 02:55.985
Okay.

02:56.019 --> 02:58.590
Well, I need to put
this bike in there.

02:58.625 --> 02:59.627
I hope it'll fit

02:59.659 --> 03:01.997
with all these little
knickknacks.

03:02.031 --> 03:04.469
Wow.
What kind of bike is that?

03:04.503 --> 03:07.007
Um, I don't know.
Average kind.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.010
The tires look
pretty worn.

03:09.044 --> 03:11.684
Well, that is probably
from the test drive.

03:11.717 --> 03:12.985
But the paint's chipping.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.857
Is that your old bike,
Michael?

03:14.890 --> 03:16.561
No.

03:16.593 --> 03:17.828
Yo, Michael.
Sweet ride, Mike.

03:17.862 --> 03:18.898
Oh, thanks.

03:18.931 --> 03:21.504
[both make explosive noise]

03:21.536 --> 03:22.506
(Pam)
Michael...

03:22.538 --> 03:23.775
Yes?

03:23.807 --> 03:25.979
Oh, Pam.

03:26.012 --> 03:27.615
That is so sweet.

03:27.649 --> 03:28.985
You didn't have
to do that.

03:29.018 --> 03:30.153
I didn't.
It's from corporate.

03:30.186 --> 03:31.791
Okay.

03:31.823 --> 03:32.959
Did everybody
get one of these?

03:32.993 --> 03:34.160
Yep.
Terrific.

03:34.195 --> 03:35.130
Good.

03:35.162 --> 03:37.969
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

03:38.003 --> 03:40.741
My girlfriend Carol
is coming to our party tonight.

03:40.774 --> 03:43.615
And I have a little
surprise for her.

03:43.648 --> 03:45.250
[belting it out]
* I've got

03:45.283 --> 03:48.725
* Two tickets to paradise

03:48.757 --> 03:52.031
* Pack your bags, we're leaving
day after tomorrow *

03:52.064 --> 03:54.702
Um, taking her to Sandals,
Jamaica.

03:54.737 --> 03:56.204
All-inclusive.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.743
All-inclusive.

03:57.775 --> 03:59.712
You know what that means.

03:59.747 --> 04:00.481
Right?

04:00.481 --> 04:02.184
Yeah.

04:09.632 --> 04:12.739
Oh, I think you're supposed
to put a toy in the box, Creed.

04:12.772 --> 04:14.207
And a happy holiday to you.

04:20.689 --> 04:21.891
Carol.

04:21.923 --> 04:23.595
Hi, is Michael
around here?

04:23.628 --> 04:24.830
There she is!

04:24.862 --> 04:26.265
A Christmas Carol.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.668
Hello.

04:27.703 --> 04:31.276
You're about five hours
early to the party.

04:31.309 --> 04:34.215
Oh, you're such a blonde.

04:34.248 --> 04:35.719
Michael...
Hey, everybody!

04:35.752 --> 04:38.924
I don't know who you
haven't met yet,

04:38.957 --> 04:40.595
but I think
this is one of them.

04:40.629 --> 04:42.898
This is my girlfriend, Carol.

04:42.932 --> 04:44.235
This is just
the front of her.

04:44.268 --> 04:46.239
Show 'em--
show 'em the other side.

04:46.272 --> 04:47.975
What?
Turn around.

04:48.008 --> 04:49.747
Turn around.
Come on.

04:49.780 --> 04:51.249
Get out of here.

04:51.282 --> 04:52.719
(Michael)
Oh, you get out of here.

04:52.753 --> 04:53.721
Michael...
Yes?

04:53.755 --> 04:54.956
If I may say,

04:54.989 --> 04:56.727
she's even prettier
than you described her.

04:56.761 --> 04:58.296
(Dwight)
Oh, ouch!

04:58.329 --> 05:00.233
Michael, I don't think
there's anything wrong

05:00.267 --> 05:02.136
with the way
you described her.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.239
Thank you.

05:03.272 --> 05:04.241
I really need a moment
alone with you.

05:04.274 --> 05:07.649
Not as much as I need
a moment alone with you.

05:07.683 --> 05:08.884
Brrp!

05:08.918 --> 05:11.154
[laughing]

05:11.189 --> 05:13.393
What is this?

05:13.427 --> 05:15.965
That is my Christmas card.

05:15.999 --> 05:18.336
It's a picture of you and me
and your kids on a ski trip,

05:18.370 --> 05:19.707
having a blast.

05:19.740 --> 05:21.142
"Ski-son's Greetings."

05:21.175 --> 05:24.248
No, see, we never
went on a ski trip.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.350
[laughing]
I know, I know.

05:25.384 --> 05:27.021
I went on a ski trip--
Right.

05:27.053 --> 05:29.258
Two years ago, with my kids
and my ex-husband.

05:29.290 --> 05:31.863
Yes, but what you didn't
realize at the time

05:31.897 --> 05:34.468
was that I was with you,
in a sense.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.239
I was in your heart.
Michael...

05:36.272 --> 05:37.943
And next to your kids.
What?

05:37.975 --> 05:40.280
This is so weird.

05:40.313 --> 05:42.116
I don't understand.

05:42.150 --> 05:44.188
It's a bold move
to Photoshop yourself

05:44.221 --> 05:46.894
into a picture with your
girlfriend and her kids

05:46.926 --> 05:49.298
on a ski trip
with their real father.

05:49.331 --> 05:52.304
But then again,
Michael's a bold guy.

05:52.337 --> 05:54.074
Is bold the right word?

05:54.107 --> 05:55.779
I think you're
a really sweet guy.

05:55.812 --> 05:56.914
Okay.

05:56.946 --> 05:58.082
But, um...

05:58.115 --> 05:59.486
I don't know how
to deal with--

05:59.518 --> 06:02.392
with, like this...thing.

06:02.425 --> 06:04.495
And--and the proposal.

06:04.528 --> 06:07.166
And I don't think things
are gonna work out with us.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.335
No, no, no, no.
Okay, okay.

06:08.370 --> 06:10.207
You know what?
You're not thinking straight.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.309
You know what you need?

06:11.341 --> 06:13.379
You need...

06:13.413 --> 06:15.016
to think this through in...

06:15.050 --> 06:16.351
[trills tongue]

06:16.385 --> 06:19.993
Jamaica's largest
freshwater pool.

06:20.026 --> 06:22.196
What are you talking about?

06:22.230 --> 06:24.200
I got us tickets...

06:24.234 --> 06:26.272
to Sandals, Jamaica.

06:26.305 --> 06:27.442
We leave
day after tomorrow.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.044
You had better find

06:29.078 --> 06:31.983
the skimpiest
bikini there is.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.018
Michael...

06:33.053 --> 06:34.254
And it's all-inclusive.

06:34.288 --> 06:36.560
Michael...
Yes?

06:36.592 --> 06:38.296
I'm sorry.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.403
No, Carol.

06:41.436 --> 06:42.973
You walk out that door,
and it is over.

06:43.006 --> 06:44.843
I know.

06:52.024 --> 06:52.993
Psst!

06:53.026 --> 06:54.328
Jim.

07:00.841 --> 07:02.545
Um, hey.

07:02.578 --> 07:03.880
Hey.

07:03.915 --> 07:05.383
I need to give you
your Christmas gift now.

07:05.417 --> 07:07.320
Because, um...

07:07.354 --> 07:08.490
Well, I'll just tell you.

07:08.523 --> 07:10.260
What?

07:10.292 --> 07:12.364
[whispering]
For the past few months,

07:12.396 --> 07:16.606
I've been sending Dwight
letters from the CIA.

07:18.576 --> 07:20.312
Are you serious?

07:20.346 --> 07:22.953
They're considering him
for a top-secret mission.

07:22.986 --> 07:24.287
There's his application.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.059
And this is where
I made him list

07:26.091 --> 07:29.265
every secret he promised
he'd never, ever tell.

07:29.297 --> 07:31.301
[chuckles]

07:31.334 --> 07:32.404
"Last year, my boss,
Michael Scott,

07:32.437 --> 07:34.977
"took a day off, 'cause
he said he had pneumonia,

07:35.010 --> 07:36.378
"but really,
he was leaving early

07:36.412 --> 07:37.949
to go to magic camp."

07:37.983 --> 07:40.020
Wow.

07:40.053 --> 07:41.055
So here's the gift.

07:41.089 --> 07:44.394
You get to decide
what his top secret mission is.

07:44.428 --> 07:46.364
Sorry I didn't wrap it.

07:49.738 --> 07:52.111
You know what?
Um...

07:52.144 --> 07:53.480
I really don't think

07:53.514 --> 07:55.484
I should be doing this stuff
anymore, though.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.622
Oh.

07:57.655 --> 07:59.324
No, just 'cause
of the promotion.

07:59.357 --> 08:00.961
Oh, yeah.
Just feels
a little bit like, uh...

08:00.961 --> 08:02.097
No, I get it.

08:02.131 --> 08:03.667
Of course.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.370
Okay.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.438
Oh.

08:15.757 --> 08:18.462
I feel like there's a chance
for me to start over.

08:18.496 --> 08:20.332
And...if I fall back

08:20.367 --> 08:23.472
into the same kind of things
I used to do, then...

08:23.507 --> 08:25.377
what am I doing?

08:30.286 --> 08:33.126
I'd like
everybody's attention.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.396
Christmas is canceled.

08:35.429 --> 08:37.134
You can't cancel a holiday.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.171
Keep it up, Stanley,
and you will lose New Year's.

08:39.205 --> 08:40.307
What does that mean?

08:40.339 --> 08:41.543
Jim, take New Year's
away from Stanley!

08:41.576 --> 08:42.376
Michael,

08:42.410 --> 08:43.412
what's going on?

08:47.887 --> 08:50.359
Carol and I...

08:50.392 --> 08:52.797
split up.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.467
Amicably.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.539
And I just don't think
it would be appropriate

08:56.573 --> 08:58.876
to celebrate
under the circumst...

08:58.909 --> 09:00.512
Will they still
air Rudolph?

09:00.547 --> 09:02.451
That's not fair.

09:02.483 --> 09:03.853
Are we going to cancel
Hanukkah as well?

09:03.886 --> 09:05.624
[all chattering]

09:05.658 --> 09:06.660
Fine!

09:06.692 --> 09:08.563
Have your party!

09:08.597 --> 09:10.568
Just no guests.

09:10.601 --> 09:12.572
But we invited guests.

09:12.605 --> 09:15.443
Well, you know what,
Phyllis?

09:15.477 --> 09:16.544
All of your guests

09:16.580 --> 09:18.583
would have
probably canceled

09:18.617 --> 09:20.319
at the last minute anyway.

09:20.353 --> 09:21.554
Leaving your life

09:21.589 --> 09:24.327
a stupid, rotten mess.

09:24.361 --> 09:25.497
Okay.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.141
[Michael groaning]

09:33.478 --> 09:35.516
It hurts.

09:35.549 --> 09:37.321
I know.

09:37.354 --> 09:39.557
It hurts my heart.

09:39.591 --> 09:42.665
It hurts my stomach.

09:42.698 --> 09:44.869
Hurts my arms.

09:44.901 --> 09:47.641
Okay, well, why are you
laying like that?

09:47.675 --> 09:49.712
Thanks.

09:49.746 --> 09:51.982
How did you push away
the bad thoughts?

09:52.015 --> 09:53.518
Like what?

09:53.552 --> 09:56.960
Like maybe
the real reason they left

09:56.992 --> 10:00.499
was because...
there were things

10:00.532 --> 10:02.805
they wanted you to do

10:02.838 --> 10:04.842
in bed...that were...

10:04.875 --> 10:07.748
Wha--um--
foreign and scary.

10:07.782 --> 10:09.686
I--I don't believe--

10:09.719 --> 10:11.655
And not that you didn't
wanna try them.

10:11.690 --> 10:13.627
Some wine
might have helped.

10:13.659 --> 10:15.597
Do you know
what I'm referring to?

10:15.631 --> 10:16.999
(Pam)
I don't need to know.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.603
Michael...
Yep?

10:18.636 --> 10:19.405
Sorry to interrupt.

10:19.437 --> 10:22.311
It appears we're
one bathrobe short.

10:22.344 --> 10:23.679
Take it from Toby.

10:23.713 --> 10:26.017
Copy.

10:26.051 --> 10:28.656
Pam, would you like to go
to Sandals, Jamaica with me?

10:28.689 --> 10:29.691
No, thank you.

10:29.725 --> 10:30.727
It's all--okay.

10:33.498 --> 10:34.701
Hey, Dwight.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.641
Some pretty nice
robes there.

10:37.674 --> 10:39.879
Why?

10:39.912 --> 10:42.082
Phyllis, I need you
to pick up green streamers

10:42.115 --> 10:43.887
at lunch.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.423
I thought you said
green was whorish.

10:45.457 --> 10:48.595
No, orange is whorish.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.872
Uh, so I had
a couple of ideas

10:52.905 --> 10:55.944
to make the Stamford people
feel more at home.

10:55.978 --> 10:58.349
Each year,
we have a Christmas raffle.

10:58.383 --> 11:00.420
Cool.
It would never
work here.

11:01.321 --> 11:02.692
Okay.

11:02.724 --> 11:05.698
Um, another idea was...
karaoke.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.601
No.

11:07.633 --> 11:08.769
A Christmas
drinking game.

11:08.803 --> 11:09.771
Yes.

11:09.806 --> 11:11.775
God help you.

11:11.810 --> 11:12.812
What?

11:12.845 --> 11:15.616
These are all terrible ideas.

11:15.650 --> 11:17.119
And none of them
are on the theme

11:17.153 --> 11:18.724
of a Nutcracker Christmas.

11:18.756 --> 11:20.728
I think you should leave.

11:22.630 --> 11:23.632
You're kidding.

11:23.666 --> 11:24.801
You tried this out.

11:24.835 --> 11:26.906
And it's clearly
not for you.

11:26.940 --> 11:28.575
It's time to go.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.817
Come on.

11:32.851 --> 11:34.655
Please?
Thank you.

11:36.859 --> 11:38.496
Okay.
Thank you very much.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.640
[James Blunt's
Goodbye My Lover playing]

11:44.675 --> 11:46.644
* She's my life
and all my goals *

11:46.679 --> 11:49.718
* I know you well

11:49.751 --> 11:50.988
What are you doing?

11:51.021 --> 11:52.724
We are getting rid
of everything

11:52.757 --> 11:54.728
that reminds you of Carol.

11:54.761 --> 11:57.734
Hey, what's a-haps?

11:57.767 --> 11:59.236
Carol?

11:59.269 --> 12:00.640
No.

12:00.672 --> 12:02.912
Oh, look at this.

12:02.945 --> 12:05.784
Your old condo
closing papers.

12:05.818 --> 12:07.521
Ew, it's riddled
with Carol's name.

12:07.553 --> 12:09.926
I wish I could
throw this in the box.

12:09.959 --> 12:13.732
* You have been
the one for me *

12:16.940 --> 12:18.174
* Touched my heart

12:18.208 --> 12:21.247
Why don't you just
buy the whole song?

12:21.281 --> 12:23.787
I don't have to buy it.

12:23.819 --> 12:25.957
I just wanna taste it.

12:25.991 --> 12:27.727
[hoarse]
That's all.

12:27.761 --> 12:30.933
I just want
a little taste of it.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.571
Oh, look at this.

12:32.604 --> 12:34.140
She saved you $2,000

12:34.174 --> 12:38.583
'cause they failed to report
a mold problem.

12:38.616 --> 12:40.286
But wouldn't that
affect the final...

12:40.318 --> 12:41.655
How did she...

12:41.689 --> 12:43.926
Oh...oh, I see
what she did.

12:43.959 --> 12:46.800
That is good.
Wow.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.304
That Carol
is one smart cookie.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.810
[singing falsetto]
* Good-bye, my lover

* You have been the one

12:55.917 --> 12:58.989
* You have been
the one for me *

13:03.766 --> 13:05.803
* Touched my heart,
touched my soul *

13:05.838 --> 13:08.307
This is an old adage,

13:08.342 --> 13:11.681
but they say that when
you find true love,

13:11.714 --> 13:14.720
you know within
the first 24 hours.

13:14.754 --> 13:17.192
With Carol,

13:17.225 --> 13:20.231
I knew within
the first 24 minutes

13:20.266 --> 13:22.871
of the second day I met her.

13:32.957 --> 13:35.898
(Pam)
I feel like I've been
kind of cold to Karen.

13:35.930 --> 13:37.701
And there's
no real reason for it.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.740
I mean, it's not like she's ever
done anything to me.

13:40.773 --> 13:43.813
So...I think I probably
shouldn't be cold to her.

13:43.847 --> 13:46.952
Hey...Karen...
um...

13:46.985 --> 13:48.054
Sorry about
that meeting today.

13:48.087 --> 13:49.758
That was really crazy.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.829
Yeah, right?
I'm so glad you said that.

13:51.863 --> 13:54.167
Because I don't know how
those meetings usually go.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.037
Um, usually like that.

13:56.070 --> 13:57.907
Does anyone ever
stand up to Angela?

13:57.942 --> 13:59.846
I think one of her cats
did once.

13:59.879 --> 14:01.681
She came in with scratches
all over her face.

14:01.681 --> 14:04.054
Right.

14:04.086 --> 14:07.193
Um...I really liked
your karaoke idea.

14:07.226 --> 14:08.228
Oh, cool, yeah.

14:08.262 --> 14:09.363
That could really be fun.

14:09.397 --> 14:10.832
You guys do a raffle?

14:10.867 --> 14:11.869
Yeah, we do a raffle.

14:16.343 --> 14:17.747
Hey, Kev.

14:17.781 --> 14:18.884
Hey.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.345
This should have
been up yesterday.

14:33.377 --> 14:34.882
It'll be all right.

14:37.386 --> 14:39.223
(Angela)
What is that?

14:39.257 --> 14:40.894
"The Committee
to Plan Parties

14:40.928 --> 14:43.298
invites you to
a Margarita-Karaoke Christmas."

14:43.332 --> 14:45.436
There's no such thing as
the Committee to Plan Parties.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.306
There is now.
We just started it.

14:47.340 --> 14:49.277
(Angela)
Well, you can't just
start a committee.

14:49.310 --> 14:50.880
You have to have funding.

14:50.914 --> 14:51.916
What's your funding?

14:51.950 --> 14:52.985
$200.

14:53.017 --> 14:53.853
What's ours again?

14:53.886 --> 14:54.888
Um, $201.

14:54.922 --> 14:55.890
Right.

14:55.924 --> 14:56.960
Hey!

14:56.993 --> 14:58.964
A Margarita-Karaoke
Christmas party.

14:58.997 --> 14:59.865
That sounds like fun.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.301
No, that is not a party.

15:01.334 --> 15:01.801
There's only one party,

15:01.801 --> 15:04.140
and it's hosted by the party
planning committee,

15:04.174 --> 15:06.979
and it starts at 3:00.

15:07.013 --> 15:08.047
Then why are there
two flyers?

15:08.082 --> 15:10.152
I understand that this
is confusing for everyone.

15:10.186 --> 15:11.420
Let me explain.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.257
There's a party
that starts at 3:00.

15:13.292 --> 15:14.593
Right.

15:14.627 --> 15:16.030
And then there's
a way more fun party

15:16.064 --> 15:16.831
that starts at 2:45.

15:16.864 --> 15:18.601
Right, and if
you're interested

15:18.635 --> 15:19.905
in the way more fun party,

15:19.939 --> 15:21.307
all the info
can be found here

15:21.341 --> 15:24.080
on our more
brightly-colored flyer.

15:29.056 --> 15:29.724
[laughing]

15:29.756 --> 15:31.929
I didn't see
where it was.

15:33.297 --> 15:35.268
Yep, looks like
the Scranton people

15:35.301 --> 15:36.538
and the Stamford people

15:36.571 --> 15:38.508
are finally
coming together.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.579
And that's
what you want, right?

15:43.052 --> 15:44.286
I think that's
a really good--

15:44.319 --> 15:46.257
Pam and Karen,
I am ordering you

15:46.290 --> 15:49.263
to cease and desist all party
planning immediately.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.068
You can't do that.

15:51.101 --> 15:52.302
As ranking number three
in this office--

15:52.335 --> 15:54.074
Um, eh...
I'm number three.

15:54.107 --> 15:55.141
You're number four.

15:55.176 --> 15:56.511
Yeah, but I'm number three.
Uh, no.

15:56.544 --> 15:59.084
You must turn over to me
all Christmas decorations

15:59.117 --> 16:00.052
and party paraphernalia
immediately

16:00.086 --> 16:01.720
that will be returned to you
on January 4th.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.457
Okay, I think
I can help here.

16:03.492 --> 16:04.459
Okay, good.

16:04.494 --> 16:06.363
As ranking number two,
I am starting a committee

16:06.397 --> 16:08.534
to determine the validity
of the two committees.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.006
And I am the sole member.

16:10.038 --> 16:11.540
The committee will act
on this now.

16:11.573 --> 16:12.743
Okay, this is stupid.

16:12.776 --> 16:14.180
Could you please keep it down?
I'm in session.

16:17.085 --> 16:19.057
I've determined
this committee is valid.

16:19.089 --> 16:20.091
What? No, no!

16:20.126 --> 16:21.061
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:21.093 --> 16:23.097
Permission to join
the validity committee.

16:26.138 --> 16:27.073
Permission denied.

16:27.105 --> 16:28.374
Damn it!

16:28.407 --> 16:31.014
[knock on door]

16:31.048 --> 16:32.682
Hey.

16:32.716 --> 16:35.221
I can't concentrate when
I know you're in pain, man.

16:35.256 --> 16:37.126
Let me take you to lunch.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.064
[sighs]

16:39.097 --> 16:40.766
Come on, my treat.

16:40.798 --> 16:42.503
All right.

16:42.536 --> 16:45.142
Nothing here to distract
myself with anyway.

16:45.176 --> 16:46.611
That's my boy.

16:46.644 --> 16:48.414
I know
the perfect place too.

16:48.447 --> 16:49.449
Hooters?

16:49.483 --> 16:51.588
No, Benihana.

16:51.621 --> 16:53.391
Much classier.

16:53.424 --> 16:55.196
But don't worry.

16:55.229 --> 16:57.399
The babes
are totally hot too.

16:57.432 --> 16:59.104
[makes explosive noise]

16:59.137 --> 17:01.273
Well, I need my entourage.

17:01.308 --> 17:02.042
Jim, Dwight, Ryan.

17:02.042 --> 17:04.446
Come on, we're going
to Asian Hooters.

17:04.479 --> 17:06.118
Oh, man, I can't.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.785
Why not?
I'm not feeling so well.

17:07.820 --> 17:08.822
I got a ton of work
to do here.

17:08.854 --> 17:10.591
MSG allergy, peanut allergy.

17:10.626 --> 17:12.130
I just ate there last night.

17:12.896 --> 17:14.499
Okay.
Feel better.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.569
Thanks.

17:15.601 --> 17:16.770
Come on, Jim.
Let's go.

17:16.804 --> 17:18.407
Okay.

17:18.442 --> 17:20.845
Wow--thanks for taking
all the excuses, dude.

17:20.879 --> 17:22.849
Doctor appointment,
car trouble, plantar warts,

17:22.883 --> 17:24.387
granddad fought in WWII.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.889
Use your head, man.
I keep mine in here.

17:25.921 --> 17:29.264
Look alive, Halpert.
Welcome back.

17:29.296 --> 17:31.300
Bros before hoes!
Why?

17:31.334 --> 17:33.504
Because your bros
are always there for you.

17:33.537 --> 17:35.242
They have got your back

17:35.276 --> 17:37.345
after your ho
rips your heart out

17:37.380 --> 17:38.882
for no good reason.

17:38.914 --> 17:41.721
And you were nothing
but great to your ho,

17:41.754 --> 17:44.493
and you told her that she was
the only ho for you,

17:44.526 --> 17:48.202
[choking up]
and that she was better than all
the other hoes in the world.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.770
And then...

17:52.243 --> 17:55.249
then suddenly,
she's not your ho no mo'.

18:00.958 --> 18:02.162
[people chattering]

18:02.162 --> 18:03.798
So...
she looks really hot.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.435
So I said,

18:05.468 --> 18:07.540
"You look hotter
than usual today."

18:07.573 --> 18:08.942
Thank you.

18:08.974 --> 18:11.380
Michael.

18:11.414 --> 18:13.252
Head of the table.

18:13.284 --> 18:14.920
Just get in right there.
Good.

18:14.953 --> 18:17.426
Jim.

18:17.459 --> 18:18.728
Actually, um...

18:18.762 --> 18:20.631
Excuse me, sir, I'm gonna
need to take this chair.

18:20.665 --> 18:21.900
Dwight, just leave them--
So...

18:21.934 --> 18:22.902
Leave them alone.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.539
Please.
They're on a date.

18:24.574 --> 18:26.444
They look very happy.

18:26.477 --> 18:29.349
(Andy)
So she looks at me, right?

18:29.384 --> 18:33.892
And she goes, "I'm sorry,
do I even know you?"

18:33.924 --> 18:35.362
After a year.

18:35.396 --> 18:36.764
A year of buying
lattes from her.

18:36.798 --> 18:38.601
Do you believe that?
Yes.

18:38.634 --> 18:39.737
I can't, uh,

18:39.770 --> 18:41.374
I can't hear
what you're saying!

18:41.408 --> 18:42.843
Carol used
to drink lattes.

18:42.876 --> 18:43.745
Who are you
talking about?

18:43.778 --> 18:46.418
She would get this little
foam moustache.

18:46.451 --> 18:47.552
(Dwight)
Carol had a moustache?

18:47.585 --> 18:49.589
And I used to say,
"Hey, got latte?"

18:49.623 --> 18:51.627
And she'd say,
"That's not funny."

18:51.660 --> 18:52.729
What are you guys
talking about?

18:52.763 --> 18:53.932
She totally got me.

18:53.965 --> 18:56.338
She understood...

18:56.371 --> 18:58.607
that we didn't have
to laugh

18:58.641 --> 19:00.711
Michael!
to enjoy each other.

19:00.745 --> 19:01.881
Repeat what you said,
louder.

19:01.914 --> 19:04.686
It is my job
to be there for Michael.

19:04.719 --> 19:06.691
How can I be there
for Michael

19:06.723 --> 19:08.294
if I'm here for Michael?

19:12.067 --> 19:15.376
I'm already starting to forget
what color eyes she had.

19:15.408 --> 19:17.945
I can't--okay.
I'm gonna call her.

19:17.979 --> 19:20.016
I am going to call
and find out--
No!

19:20.050 --> 19:21.085
Who are you calling?

19:21.119 --> 19:22.955
Put it away.
I'm gonna call her.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.728
Put that away.
SOS--we--hi.

19:25.761 --> 19:27.064
Mayday.
[laughs]

19:27.097 --> 19:29.969
Man down over here.
We need your help.

19:30.004 --> 19:31.673
What can I get for ya?

19:31.708 --> 19:35.815
I think we'll start with
a round of Nog-a-sakes.

19:35.849 --> 19:39.087
One part eggnog.
Three parts sake!

19:39.122 --> 19:41.461
Some places won't
make it for you, though,

19:41.494 --> 19:43.865
because eggnog
is seasonal.

19:45.969 --> 19:48.807
You should put out salt
for the rims.

19:48.841 --> 19:50.678
That's a great idea.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.483
(Angela)
Phyllis?

19:52.516 --> 19:54.719
I was just
getting a snack.

19:54.753 --> 19:56.658
You can have
your snack in here.

19:56.690 --> 19:58.125
Pam, don't tell her
what to do.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.127
Phyllis...

19:59.162 --> 20:00.831
Oh...okay.

20:06.510 --> 20:08.682
I think I'll go
to Angela's party

20:08.714 --> 20:10.986
because that's the party
I know.

20:11.018 --> 20:13.725
I miss the days when
there was only one party

20:13.758 --> 20:15.059
I didn't want to go to.

20:16.162 --> 20:18.502
So I only use three?

20:18.535 --> 20:20.672
If you're using more
than three pieces of tape

20:20.705 --> 20:22.743
to wrap a present,
you're doing it wrong.

20:22.775 --> 20:24.980
Okay, and where'd you get
all those cool bows?

20:25.014 --> 20:28.053
Oh, I just get those
at any party supply place.

20:28.085 --> 20:30.759
Okay.

20:30.791 --> 20:32.262
Are you sure
I can't use, like,

20:32.294 --> 20:33.832
the cartoons
from the newspaper?

20:33.864 --> 20:36.136
Oh, yeah, your mom
would love that.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.909
Hey.
Hey.

20:39.943 --> 20:41.813
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

20:41.847 --> 20:43.884
Bye.

20:43.917 --> 20:45.622
He's cute.

20:45.656 --> 20:46.857
You should date him.

20:46.890 --> 20:47.959
Oh...

20:47.993 --> 20:49.896
Yeah, maybe.

20:53.572 --> 20:55.074
Looks like you got

20:55.107 --> 20:57.780
a little nakiri
knife action going there.

20:57.812 --> 20:59.182
No, it's usuba.

20:59.215 --> 21:02.221
Yeah, I bet you wish
you had a nakiri, though.

21:02.253 --> 21:04.594
Actually, the usuba's
the better knife

21:04.627 --> 21:06.262
when you're working
with this quantity.

21:06.296 --> 21:08.100
Eh, I don't know.

21:08.132 --> 21:09.769
Still think
nakiri's better.

21:09.804 --> 21:12.308
I think he'd know.

21:14.847 --> 21:17.886
Nothing he's doing
is cheering me up.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.324
Wait for the onion.
Trust me.

21:22.995 --> 21:25.802
(Andy)
Hey, Cindy.

21:25.835 --> 21:26.703
He just had
his heart broken.

21:26.738 --> 21:28.307
You wouldn't do that
to him, would you?

21:28.340 --> 21:29.744
I don't know.

21:29.776 --> 21:30.911
Oh, sure you would.
Look at you.

21:30.946 --> 21:33.818
I bet you break up
with a guy every hour.

21:33.851 --> 21:35.220
[chuckles]

21:35.254 --> 21:36.890
You made her laugh!

21:36.923 --> 21:39.697
Yes!
She totally digs us.

21:39.730 --> 21:41.734
Watch, watch.

21:43.937 --> 21:45.340
Huh? Huh?

21:45.375 --> 21:47.912
What did I tell you?

21:47.945 --> 21:49.316
You're right.
That's good.

21:54.258 --> 21:55.796
Hello, everyone.

21:55.829 --> 21:57.900
We would just
like to announce

21:57.932 --> 21:58.867
that our party
is starting now

21:58.902 --> 22:00.971
in the break room,
so--

22:01.005 --> 22:01.841
I have a very important

22:01.873 --> 22:03.911
announcement to make.

22:03.945 --> 22:05.948
About...

22:05.982 --> 22:07.218
your paychecks.

22:07.250 --> 22:10.024
Um...your paychecks
will be arriving

22:10.057 --> 22:13.329
as scheduled on Friday.

22:13.363 --> 22:15.434
And they will be
in the correct amount

22:15.468 --> 22:17.004
that they normally are in.

22:19.844 --> 22:22.882
Please stand by for a very
important announcement

22:22.916 --> 22:24.452
further regarding
your paycheck!

22:24.486 --> 22:27.258
[running footsteps]

22:27.291 --> 22:29.864
I need to know
if I can start the party.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.270
Michael!

22:33.303 --> 22:34.874
Hey!

22:34.907 --> 22:35.941
Over here, Michael!

22:35.976 --> 22:37.444
[whistling]

22:37.479 --> 22:39.315
[Dwight groans and grunts]

22:39.348 --> 22:41.888
I don't know.
No one can hear me.

22:41.921 --> 22:43.992
You know what?
Start the party.

22:44.024 --> 22:46.195
Did Michael give you permission
to do this?

22:48.032 --> 22:49.937
Start the party.

22:51.908 --> 22:53.977
Also, I would like
to inform you

22:54.012 --> 22:55.381
that, um,

22:55.415 --> 22:58.119
as a special treat,
my party will be starting early.

22:58.152 --> 22:59.523
In fact,
it will be starting...

22:59.555 --> 23:01.026
right now.

23:01.058 --> 23:04.065
Our party is also
starting now.
Yep.

23:29.416 --> 23:31.285
All right, Stanley.
Good choice.

23:31.319 --> 23:32.253
Woo!

23:35.962 --> 23:39.167
Welcome, Hannah.
You will not be disappointed.

23:39.201 --> 23:40.370
Why would I be
disappointed?

23:40.404 --> 23:42.475
I said you wouldn't
be disappointed.

23:45.548 --> 23:47.886
Meredith, if you don't
come to my party,

23:47.920 --> 23:50.458
you will be
very, very sorry.

23:50.491 --> 23:52.327
Is that a threat?

23:52.361 --> 23:55.266
No, it's an invitation.

23:55.299 --> 23:57.004
We have vodka!
Lots of it.

24:02.213 --> 24:06.421
I hear Angela's party will
have double fudge brownies.

24:06.457 --> 24:08.527
But it will also have Angela.

24:08.560 --> 24:13.136
So, double fudge.
Angela.

24:13.169 --> 24:18.413
Double fudge...Angela.

24:20.017 --> 24:22.320
Hmm...

24:24.659 --> 24:26.195
Brownies.

24:26.229 --> 24:27.732
Cupcakes.

24:27.764 --> 24:29.201
Don't push it.

24:39.022 --> 24:41.759
Are we taking this too far?
You know what?

24:41.792 --> 24:45.199
I don't think we're
taking this far enough.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.038
What?

24:47.071 --> 24:49.307
I got goose bumps.

24:50.645 --> 24:52.248
I don't back down.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.619
My sister and I used to be
best friends,

24:54.653 --> 24:57.091
and we haven't talked
in 16 years

24:57.124 --> 24:59.495
over some disagreement
I don't even remember.

24:59.529 --> 25:04.238
So...yeah,
I'm pretty good.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.813
Oh!
Damn, this chicken is good.

25:08.847 --> 25:11.552
My compliments
to the chef.

25:11.587 --> 25:13.256
Which is you!

25:13.289 --> 25:14.358
Right?

25:14.392 --> 25:17.163
[laughs]
Awesome!

25:17.197 --> 25:18.633
I need some meat.

25:18.666 --> 25:20.605
I want some steak.

25:20.638 --> 25:23.309
That guy's got steak.

25:23.343 --> 25:25.179
* I see steak

25:25.214 --> 25:26.448
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.587
En garde!

25:28.621 --> 25:31.226
[laughs]
It's family style.

25:31.258 --> 25:32.694
No, it's not.

25:32.729 --> 25:34.566
Oh, God.
Cindy!

25:34.599 --> 25:36.169
Cindy!
I love steak.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.505
I love it!

25:38.540 --> 25:41.212
I want you
to close your eyes

25:41.246 --> 25:43.584
and imagine
your dream house.

25:45.386 --> 25:47.191
Come on!

25:47.224 --> 25:50.429
Do it for Michael.
He's had a really long day.

25:50.463 --> 25:51.733
[laughs]
What are you doing?

25:51.767 --> 25:53.236
This is great.

25:53.270 --> 25:55.174
Jim! Jim!

25:58.313 --> 26:00.416
What--what's happening?

26:00.449 --> 26:03.122
Oh, she's asleep.

26:03.122 --> 26:05.628
Oh, narcolepsy.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.164
Probably.

26:07.198 --> 26:09.535
Okay,
now open your eyes

26:09.567 --> 26:12.173
and describe it to me.

26:12.208 --> 26:14.613
I don't know.

26:14.646 --> 26:16.549
It has four bedrooms
and a loft.

26:16.582 --> 26:18.520
Oh, my God.
Now she's up.
Yeah?

26:18.553 --> 26:19.788
And she's trying
to describe

26:19.823 --> 26:21.693
how to correctly
butcher a goose,

26:21.727 --> 26:23.530
but she's having trouble
coming up with it.

26:23.562 --> 26:25.299
Okay.
Cindy!

26:25.334 --> 26:26.670
Yo, Cindy, Cindy.

26:26.703 --> 26:28.741
Hold its neck back,

26:28.774 --> 26:30.576
insert the knife
beneath the jaw,

26:30.610 --> 26:32.380
bring it
all the way around.

26:32.414 --> 26:34.485
There's gonna be
a good amount of blood.

26:34.517 --> 26:35.654
Don't let that bother you.

26:35.688 --> 26:37.324
Have a bucket there
for the blood

26:37.358 --> 26:39.295
and the innards
and the feathers.

26:40.529 --> 26:42.468
Oh, no,
this is different.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.806
The CIA thing, that was
a prank on Dwight.

26:44.839 --> 26:48.914
This is more like
a, um--

26:48.946 --> 26:50.583
Okay, it's pretty much
the same thing.

What do you think?

27:06.883 --> 27:08.485
Fruity and delicious.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.324
See, I told you.
You want one, Meredith?

27:10.356 --> 27:13.362
No thanks.
They're too sweet.

27:13.395 --> 27:15.800
Hey, so what's the status?

27:15.835 --> 27:17.403
Looks like they forgot
the power cord.

27:17.437 --> 27:18.774
What?
Oh, you're kidding me.

27:18.806 --> 27:20.910
No.
Oh, God.

27:20.945 --> 27:21.912
You guys, guys.

27:21.947 --> 27:23.516
I'm sorry,

27:23.549 --> 27:25.320
but there's a problem
with the karaoke machine.

27:25.354 --> 27:27.758
Well, that blows.

Hang on, little ladies.
You don't need this thing.

27:29.663 --> 27:31.699
I'll go grab
my synthesizer.

Hey, look when you get done
with your...meeting

27:47.663 --> 27:48.700
you should come
to the break room.

27:48.733 --> 27:49.535
We're having a party.

27:49.567 --> 27:52.408
Oh, okay.
All right?
See you later.

until everyone's had some.

You've got to be kidding.

You've got to be kidding.

Cold, huh?

Yeah.

That'll help.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.486
Is it cold in there?

out all night.

we should do?
What?

28:38.264 --> 28:40.504
We should invite them
to the Christmas party.

Now you are thinking.
Yes!

And you know what?

28:44.512 --> 28:46.649
Because you have had
such a rough day,

28:46.681 --> 28:48.251
you get Cindy.

my new girlfriend.

to meet her too.

29:07.825 --> 29:09.027
The least I could do

29:09.061 --> 29:12.568
was give some poor
sick kid a bike.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.736
That rocks.

29:13.770 --> 29:15.706
Yeah, you rock.

29:15.740 --> 29:17.310
Tell you what.
If you want it, it's yours.

29:17.343 --> 29:18.981
Thanks!

29:19.014 --> 29:21.919
[laughter]

29:21.952 --> 29:23.288
I want to
give you something.

29:23.322 --> 29:25.828
Oh.

29:25.860 --> 29:27.097
[snorts]

29:27.130 --> 29:29.802
That's what she said?

29:29.836 --> 29:31.170
Hello!

29:31.205 --> 29:32.874
I would like everybody
to meet

29:32.909 --> 29:33.911
my new girlfriend.

29:33.943 --> 29:35.747
And my new girlfriend.

29:35.780 --> 29:38.119
Where's Dwight?

29:38.152 --> 29:39.888
Is he the hot one
or the giant baby?

29:39.922 --> 29:40.890
[whispering]
The giant baby.

29:40.924 --> 29:42.661
Wow, I am so sorry.

29:42.694 --> 29:45.266
I had no idea
this party'd be so lame.

29:45.298 --> 29:47.036
There's another party
in the break room.

29:47.070 --> 29:48.371
Oh, party
in the break room.

29:48.404 --> 29:50.243
Let's go, let's go.
Thank God.

29:50.276 --> 29:51.746
Let's go to the break room.

29:51.779 --> 29:53.983
Hey, excuse me!
Waitress lady, hey!

29:54.016 --> 29:54.918
Where do you think
you're going with that?

29:54.952 --> 29:56.221
I thought
I could have it.

29:56.255 --> 29:58.292
You can't have it.

29:58.324 --> 29:59.662
I don't walk
into your house

29:59.695 --> 30:00.830
and steal your
Hello Kitty backpack.

30:00.865 --> 30:02.332
Ssshut it!

30:02.367 --> 30:03.602
Come on, party.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.975
Hey, it's Angela!

30:10.282 --> 30:13.991
* I want you to know

30:14.024 --> 30:18.833
* That I'm happy
for you *

30:18.867 --> 30:22.173
* I wish nothing but...

30:22.207 --> 30:25.078
I just think that
there are two--

30:25.112 --> 30:28.019
two specific kinds of
people in the world.

30:28.051 --> 30:32.861
People who own houses
and people who own condos.

30:32.895 --> 30:35.800
All right?

30:35.834 --> 30:38.841
And my question to you

30:38.874 --> 30:41.445
is do you agree?

30:41.477 --> 30:43.048
Do I agree about what?

30:43.081 --> 30:44.985
Do you agree about what?

30:45.018 --> 30:47.323
[laughs]

30:47.357 --> 30:49.194
Wow!

30:49.227 --> 30:51.331
You're lucky
you're so darn cute.

30:51.365 --> 30:53.235
What are you
talking about?
Huh?

30:53.269 --> 30:54.772
What are you
talking about?

30:54.805 --> 30:58.914
* And I'm here
to remind you *

30:58.946 --> 31:03.088
* Of the mess you left
when you went away *

31:03.121 --> 31:06.963
* It's not fair
to deny me *

31:06.996 --> 31:09.902
* Of the cross I bear
that you give to me *

31:09.936 --> 31:12.207
* You, You, You
* Oughta know

31:12.240 --> 31:15.345
* You, you, oughta know *

31:15.378 --> 31:19.020
(Roy)
Way to go, Kev.
Good work.

31:19.054 --> 31:21.927
[Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy continues]

31:21.959 --> 31:29.406
*

31:29.441 --> 31:31.947
Did you have fun
at Benihana's?

31:31.979 --> 31:33.582
No, it was awful.

31:33.614 --> 31:35.453
I couldn't hear
anything.

31:35.485 --> 31:38.893
[laughter, chatter
from break room party]

31:38.927 --> 31:41.264
I've had the worst
day here.

31:47.242 --> 31:51.351
Dwight,
you won the raffle.

31:51.385 --> 31:54.290
No way! Yeah!

31:54.324 --> 31:55.493
Open it, open it!

31:55.526 --> 31:58.967
[Dwight laughing
in anticipation]

31:59.001 --> 32:01.371
Do you like it?
Walkie-talkies!

32:01.405 --> 32:03.009
[whispering]
Can I talk to you a sec?

32:03.042 --> 32:03.842
(Dwight)
Yes!

32:03.842 --> 32:08.151
Well, the Committee to Plan
Parties has served its purpose.

32:08.185 --> 32:12.559
We're gonna disband
in the name of Christmas.

32:12.593 --> 32:15.366
In the name of
Nutcracker Christmas.

32:15.398 --> 32:18.105
[laughter in break room]

32:18.138 --> 32:21.545
Angela, we've been hearing
really great things

32:21.577 --> 32:23.182
about your brownies.

32:23.214 --> 32:25.218
And we were hoping
you'd consider

32:25.253 --> 32:26.990
merging the two parties.

32:27.022 --> 32:29.026
I'm not sure.

32:32.166 --> 32:35.406
Does your karaoke machine
have Christmas songs?

32:35.439 --> 32:37.309
Yeah, but we don't
have a power cord.

32:37.342 --> 32:41.085
Oh, I may have
seen it somewhere.

32:46.628 --> 32:48.599
Is it this one?

32:48.632 --> 32:50.603
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.174
Thanks.

32:53.209 --> 32:54.644
We'll go tell everyone.

32:54.676 --> 32:56.680
Okay.

32:59.087 --> 33:02.027
* And if you want love

33:02.060 --> 33:03.962
* We'll make it

33:03.962 --> 33:09.073
* Swim in a big sea
of blankets *

33:09.107 --> 33:14.384
* Take all your big plans
and break 'em *

33:14.416 --> 33:19.061
* This is bound
to take a while *

33:19.093 --> 33:23.602
* Your body is
a wonderland *

33:23.634 --> 33:26.808
* Your body is a wonderland

33:26.840 --> 33:29.213
* Your hair is

33:29.247 --> 33:32.087
* Your body
is a wonderland *

33:32.120 --> 33:34.324
* I'll use
my hands on it *

33:34.356 --> 33:36.195
* Mm-hmm

33:36.228 --> 33:40.203
* Something about the way your
hair falls in your face *

33:40.236 --> 33:43.242
* Whatever we deny
or embrace *

33:43.274 --> 33:46.181
* For worse or for better

33:46.215 --> 33:48.784
* We belong

33:48.819 --> 33:53.262
* We belong,
we belong together, Ryan *

33:53.294 --> 33:56.235
When you know,
you just know.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.436
Right?

33:57.469 --> 33:58.438
Right.

33:58.471 --> 34:00.276
Check her out.

34:00.308 --> 34:02.446
My little gal over there?
Babe-a-lectible.

34:02.479 --> 34:04.083
Which one is she?

34:07.290 --> 34:10.528
It's one of those two.

34:10.562 --> 34:11.731
You don't know?

34:11.764 --> 34:13.134
Dude, you should know.

34:13.169 --> 34:15.573
Yeah, well,
it's been hard.

34:15.606 --> 34:18.311
They're wearing
the exact same uniform.

34:18.345 --> 34:20.283
And I've been drinking.

34:20.315 --> 34:23.388
And you know how all...

34:23.422 --> 34:25.258
waitresses look alike.

34:25.293 --> 34:27.697
[Kevin and Roy snicker]

34:27.730 --> 34:30.602
I honestly don't see
what the big deal is.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.173
Stevie Wonder is married.

34:32.207 --> 34:35.345
Are you going to tell me
that Steve Wonder

34:35.379 --> 34:38.185
doesn't love his wife just
because he's not sure

34:38.219 --> 34:39.421
what she looks like?

34:39.453 --> 34:41.191
Hey!

34:41.225 --> 34:44.197
Where's my girl?

34:44.231 --> 34:47.237
Is she in the fridge?

34:47.270 --> 34:49.606
Where is she hiding?

34:49.640 --> 34:53.514
I don't know where she is.

34:53.548 --> 34:55.286
Oh, 'cause I'm drunk.

34:55.319 --> 34:57.857
I can't even find her.
Argh-argh!

34:57.890 --> 34:59.327
[laughter]

34:59.361 --> 35:01.231
You know where I am.
I do!

35:01.265 --> 35:02.967
Hi!

35:02.999 --> 35:05.238
I just haven't
hugged you in a while.

35:05.272 --> 35:07.343
Mmm!

35:07.376 --> 35:08.644
Good.
That felt good.

35:08.678 --> 35:12.752
Let's go party.

35:12.787 --> 35:16.461
* Spinning and reeling
with love *

35:16.494 --> 35:18.431
* Given the time

35:18.465 --> 35:22.607
* I might come back down

35:22.639 --> 35:25.346
* But it feels so good

35:25.378 --> 35:27.750
* My feet don't touch
the ground *

35:27.783 --> 35:29.354
* Waa, waa

35:29.386 --> 35:31.758
* Waa, waa

35:33.461 --> 35:36.935
* Well, everybody knows
I'm crazy about you... *

35:36.968 --> 35:40.409
Monkey, this is Possum.
Do you copy?

35:40.443 --> 35:42.010
Copy, Possum.
What's your 20?

35:42.045 --> 35:44.851
No way!

35:44.884 --> 35:47.522
What a horrible,
horrible movie that was.

35:47.557 --> 35:49.494
And now I get to
remember it forever.

35:49.526 --> 35:52.800
Thank you.
Thank you.

35:52.833 --> 35:56.908
* She kind of puts
my head in gear *

35:56.941 --> 35:59.514
Hey.
Hey.
Hey you!

35:59.546 --> 36:01.550
How are you?

36:01.585 --> 36:04.323
This party blows,
so we're gonna leave.

36:04.323 --> 36:05.926
No, no, no.

36:05.959 --> 36:08.832
Hey, you should stay
because we're having fun.

36:08.865 --> 36:11.637
And...where do you
want to go?

36:11.671 --> 36:13.675
I--we're just gonna
take off.

36:13.709 --> 36:17.516
You know what?
I--okay, listen.

36:17.549 --> 36:18.752
I like you.

36:18.784 --> 36:20.622
I really like you.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.759
So much, in fact, that

36:22.792 --> 36:24.931
I would like you
to accompany me

36:24.964 --> 36:28.972
on a trip
to Sandals Jamaica.

36:29.004 --> 36:32.512
No, I have school.

36:40.563 --> 36:42.533
You want help?
Okay.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.002
Merry Christmas!

36:44.035 --> 36:47.175
(Cindy)
Merry Christmas.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.514
* Lady

36:49.547 --> 36:54.691
* From the moment
I saw you *

36:54.723 --> 37:01.505
* Standing all alone

37:01.538 --> 37:08.719
* You gave all the love
that I needed... *

37:09.620 --> 37:12.626
That waitress
was the one.

37:12.659 --> 37:15.230
No, she wasn't.

37:15.265 --> 37:17.100
How can you be sure?

37:17.134 --> 37:18.705
Well, for starters,

37:18.738 --> 37:19.606
I've known you
as a couple

37:19.640 --> 37:21.108
since the beginning
of the relationship,

37:21.143 --> 37:23.649
which was approximately
three hours ago.

37:23.681 --> 37:27.590
Don't make fun of me.
You're making fun of me.

37:27.622 --> 37:29.493
Sorry.

37:32.800 --> 37:33.869
[scoffs]

37:33.901 --> 37:36.575
I guess I didn't
know her very well.

37:39.045 --> 37:41.316
I marked her arm.

37:41.349 --> 37:42.852
You what?

37:42.886 --> 37:45.292
[laughter]

37:45.324 --> 37:47.630
I--I put a mark
on her arm.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.109
So I could
tell 'em apart.

37:54.142 --> 37:57.583
I don't--
I know, I know.

37:57.617 --> 37:59.285
[exhales deeply]

37:59.320 --> 38:01.625
I can't believe
I gave her my bike.

38:01.658 --> 38:04.563
Yeah.

38:04.563 --> 38:08.738
Why do I feel like crap?

38:08.772 --> 38:12.177
You just had a rebound.

38:12.211 --> 38:14.616
Had a rebound.

38:14.651 --> 38:16.754
Yeah.

38:16.787 --> 38:18.157
Which, don't get me wrong,

38:18.189 --> 38:20.862
can be a really fun
distraction.

38:20.896 --> 38:23.969
But when it's over,

38:24.001 --> 38:26.641
you're left thinking about
the girl you really like.

38:26.675 --> 38:28.744
The one that broke
your heart.

38:33.722 --> 38:35.859
I totally rebounded.

38:35.892 --> 38:37.428
Someone else shoots,

38:37.461 --> 38:39.400
and I take the ball
and I score.

38:39.432 --> 38:41.136
Well, I guess I didn't
really score.

38:41.169 --> 38:44.209
And I'm not sure who is
actually shooting,

38:44.242 --> 38:46.379
but...whatever.

38:46.414 --> 38:47.448
Doesn't matter.

38:47.481 --> 38:49.687
It's all good.

38:49.721 --> 38:50.988
Or as my ex might say,

38:51.022 --> 38:57.737
"Domo arigato,
Mr. Scott-o."

38:57.770 --> 39:01.142
* Little baby

39:01.176 --> 39:05.786
* Pa rum pum pum pum

39:05.819 --> 39:08.959
* I am a poor boy too

39:08.991 --> 39:13.299
* Pa rum pum pum pum

39:13.332 --> 39:16.173
* I have no gift to bring

39:16.206 --> 39:19.880
* Pa rum pum pum pum

39:19.913 --> 39:22.986
* That's fit to give
our king *

39:23.020 --> 39:24.456
* Pa rum pum pump pum...

39:24.489 --> 39:27.963
Um, yes, I just
wanted to see

39:27.996 --> 39:31.971
if you would like to come
to Jamaica with me.

39:32.004 --> 39:35.878
There's this resort
called Sandals.

39:38.082 --> 39:41.289
Really?

39:41.323 --> 39:43.795
Okay.
All right.

39:43.829 --> 39:45.833
I promise you won't be
disappointed.

39:45.866 --> 39:49.039
Um, it's all-inclusive.

39:49.071 --> 39:50.274
* Shall I play for you

39:50.307 --> 39:54.214
* Pa rum pum pum pum

39:54.248 --> 39:55.384
Too soon.

39:55.418 --> 39:58.122
* I played my drum
for him *

39:58.156 --> 40:02.566
* Pa rum pum pum pum

40:02.598 --> 40:04.803
* I played
my best for him *

40:04.803 --> 40:07.608
* Pa rum pum pum pum

40:07.642 --> 40:09.913
* Rum pum pum pum

40:09.947 --> 40:11.483

40:11.517 --> 40:13.520
* Rum pum pum pum *

40:17.495 --> 40:19.866
Night, Pam.
Night.

40:22.639 --> 40:24.209
Oh, you know what?

40:24.241 --> 40:26.447
Sorry, I forgot
to tell you.

40:26.479 --> 40:28.451
I intercepted
a transmission earlier,

40:28.483 --> 40:31.255
and it seems that the CIA is
gonna need Dwight

40:31.288 --> 40:33.326
down at their headquarters
at Langley for training

40:33.360 --> 40:36.901
and an ice cream social
with the other agents.

40:38.638 --> 40:40.542
We should get him
a bus ticket.

40:40.575 --> 40:41.444
