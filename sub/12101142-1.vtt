(intense music)

04:12.047 --> 04:13.464
- Hi, it's Becky!

04:14.689 --> 04:17.153
You have to come in here really quick!

04:17.153 --> 04:19.550
I found some information that
you have to see right now!

04:19.550 --> 04:21.851
You have to come in here right now!

04:21.851 --> 04:22.684
Hurry up!

04:22.684 --> 04:25.434
(intense music)

04:30.715 --> 04:34.139
- Becky, got your call. What's going on?

04:34.139 --> 04:35.497
- I just imaged an astroid and it jumped.

04:36.993 --> 04:37.826
There's only thing in the
universe that can do that.

04:40.102 --> 04:42.660
- What's going on? What do we have?

04:42.660 --> 04:44.213
- It's an asteroid.

04:44.213 --> 04:45.491
- Is it true?
- I can't believe

04:45.491 --> 04:46.602
what I'm hearing.
- Is it true?

04:46.602 --> 04:48.200
- No, no, it can't be.
- Yes, it is, it's true.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.666
- Are you serious?
- Yes, it's a black hole.

04:49.666 --> 04:50.710
Yes, it's true!
- Do we have any research?

04:50.710 --> 04:52.266
Do we have any paperwork on it?

04:52.266 --> 04:55.016
(dramatic music)

05:07.923 --> 05:11.001
(knocks on door)

05:11.001 --> 05:12.756
- General, you're here. Come on in.

05:12.756 --> 05:15.506
(dramatic music)

05:32.070 --> 05:34.241
- Okay, little lady.
What do you got for me?

05:34.241 --> 05:35.445
Let me hear it.

05:35.445 --> 05:40.293
- I just imaged an asteroid
and it jumped, sir.

05:41.450 --> 05:45.253
There's only one object in
the universe that can do that.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.490
- We believe it's a black hole, sir.

05:48.490 --> 05:51.300
That's what the calculations suggest.

05:51.300 --> 05:54.685
- Okay, you wanna explain
why this is important to me?

05:54.685 --> 05:56.349
- Two multi-aspects!

05:56.349 --> 05:59.572
(dramatic music)

05:59.572 --> 06:01.830
- Okay.
- It's bending light!

06:01.830 --> 06:05.390
There's only one thing in the
universe that could do that!

06:05.390 --> 06:07.580
In 10 years, it'll reach our solar system

06:07.580 --> 06:09.130
and destroy it in its entirety!

06:10.960 --> 06:13.690
- Okay, I'm gonna need everything you got.

06:13.690 --> 06:17.100
Electronics, computers,
media, any print outs.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.700
We have to get this to the
proper authorities in DC.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.000
Don't hold anything back.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.667
(ominous music)

06:27.671 --> 06:30.588
(papers rustling)

06:35.074 --> 06:36.435
That's it?

06:36.435 --> 06:38.852
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, thank you.

06:44.025 --> 06:45.262
You know what to do.

06:45.262 --> 06:46.156
Ice the nerds.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.823
(intense music)

06:50.126 --> 06:51.334
- Hey, wait no!
(gun firing)

06:51.334 --> 06:52.962
- No!
- (screaming) Oh my God!

06:52.962 --> 06:54.484
(intense music)

06:54.484 --> 06:56.901
(gun firing)

07:42.601 --> 07:44.532
Forget it. Let me know
if there's any changes.

07:44.532 --> 07:47.199
(intense music)

08:03.396 --> 08:06.979
Andrew, let me speak
with Lieutenant Stone.

08:08.305 --> 08:09.893
Dennis Stone, Luciano Thomas.

08:09.893 --> 08:11.130
I'm gonna be coming in by chopper.

08:11.130 --> 08:12.400
Could you have a car ready for me?

08:12.400 --> 08:15.100
We gotta go right to the
VP's office when I get there.

08:16.590 --> 08:17.540
Okay, no problem.

08:17.540 --> 08:20.570
I'll see you there in,
um, 15 to the chopper,

08:20.570 --> 08:22.950
about an hour and a half or so, okay?

08:22.950 --> 08:24.105
Be ready. Thank you.

08:24.105 --> 08:26.136
(intense music)

08:26.136 --> 08:28.803
(gas trickling)

08:31.790 --> 08:32.939
It's Thomas here.

08:32.939 --> 08:34.307
I just got done meeting with the nerds

08:34.307 --> 08:35.744
at the observatory.

08:35.744 --> 08:37.081
This don't look good.

08:37.081 --> 08:40.325
We got a black hole and
a serious situation.

08:40.325 --> 08:43.150
(indistinct)

08:43.150 --> 08:45.817
(intense music)

08:58.637 --> 08:59.970
Five and a half.

09:00.886 --> 09:03.468
(gas trickling)

09:03.468 --> 09:06.135
(intense music)

10:16.213 --> 10:18.880
(fire roaring)

11:02.940 --> 11:04.571
- There's no smoking.

11:04.571 --> 11:07.960
(lighter clicks)

11:07.960 --> 11:09.273
So what's this urgency?

11:12.998 --> 11:14.646
- See for yourself, sir.

11:14.646 --> 11:17.396
(dramatic music)

11:27.100 --> 11:29.700
- Okay, so what am I looking at?

11:30.650 --> 11:32.650
- You're looking at the black hole, sir.

11:35.230 --> 11:37.670
- It's in our solar system's path.

11:37.670 --> 11:40.460
What you're looking at is
the complete annihilation

11:40.460 --> 11:41.873
of human existence.

11:44.940 --> 11:46.340
- I'll inform the president.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.980
You inform NASA and the pentagon.

11:50.980 --> 11:53.950
I don't have to say this
but I'm gonna say it.

11:53.950 --> 11:56.013
Not a word to anyone. This is top secret.

11:56.990 --> 11:59.362
- We've already taken
steps to assure that, sir.

11:59.362 --> 12:02.112
(dramatic music)

12:07.470 --> 12:11.910
Yeah, you're gonna have
to cut that golf trip

12:11.910 --> 12:13.170
a little short, sir.

12:15.420 --> 12:18.150
No, we need to sit down
with our Space Force

12:18.150 --> 12:19.563
and our corporate financier.

12:21.900 --> 12:22.835
Yes.

12:22.835 --> 12:25.585
(dramatic music)

12:49.990 --> 12:51.740
- Um, can I help you?

12:55.443 --> 12:57.710
"A radical left wing group
has started a string of terror

12:57.710 --> 12:59.110
starting with the burning down

12:59.110 --> 13:01.910
of the Westport Space
Observatory located in Westport,

13:01.910 --> 13:04.720
killing all the astronomers inside.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.660
The reasons are unclear."

13:06.660 --> 13:08.060
I'm not reporting this shit.

13:15.860 --> 13:16.693
Jesus.

13:19.918 --> 13:23.251
(dramatic theme music)

13:26.940 --> 13:28.720
Live from the Westport Observatory,

13:28.720 --> 13:31.210
a radical left wing group has
started a string of terror

13:31.210 --> 13:32.320
starting with the burning down

13:32.320 --> 13:33.940
of the Westport Space Observatory

13:33.940 --> 13:35.440
located here in Westport,

13:35.440 --> 13:37.570
killing all of the astronomers inside.

13:37.570 --> 13:39.090
The reasons are unclear.

13:39.090 --> 13:40.480
The Federal Bureau of Investigation

13:40.480 --> 13:41.940
was brought in to find the terrorists

13:41.940 --> 13:43.170
behind this heinous act.

13:43.170 --> 13:46.050
The motive behind the burning
down of the space observatory

13:46.050 --> 13:49.226
by this mystery group
has yet to be determined.

13:49.226 --> 13:54.226
(intense music)
(helicopter whirring)

14:22.860 --> 14:24.320
- May I help you with something?

14:24.320 --> 14:27.822
- Yeah, this entire
facility is being relocated.

14:27.822 --> 14:29.201
- What do you mean? Where?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.760
- What will become of our jobs?

14:30.760 --> 14:32.260
- Your jobs go with you,

14:32.260 --> 14:34.830
relocate your families to Florida,

14:34.830 --> 14:36.370
and you go into the space station.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.780
We're setting up a
hydroponics farm up there.

14:38.780 --> 14:41.560
- Space station? As in space?

14:41.560 --> 14:43.190
- Yeah.

14:43.190 --> 14:44.640
- And what if we refuse?

14:44.640 --> 14:46.950
- You refuse, you lose your job,

14:46.950 --> 14:47.840
you go home to your family.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.000
we get new botanists.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.740
It's a government facility.
It's a government garden.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.017
It's a government space station.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.159
It's that simple.

14:55.159 --> 14:58.492
(dramatic theme music)

15:01.676 --> 15:02.890
- Today on the "Four O'clock News,"

15:02.890 --> 15:04.410
NASA will be announcing the construction

15:04.410 --> 15:06.030
of a new large space station.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.635
The president will be addressing
this during his conference.

15:09.635 --> 15:12.468
(patriotic music)

15:14.568 --> 15:16.478
- Mr. President!
(indistinct)

15:16.478 --> 15:17.717
Can you comment on climate change?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.690
Climate change?
- Good evening.

15:19.690 --> 15:20.980
In my first inaugural address,
(shutters clicking)

15:20.980 --> 15:22.480
I committed myself to this country,

15:22.480 --> 15:25.030
to the tireless task of
global peace between nations

15:25.030 --> 15:27.460
and protecting the people
for future generations.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.310
There I sat with the leaders
to discuss working together

15:30.310 --> 15:32.130
in the new space race and combating acts

15:32.130 --> 15:33.580
of terrorism together.

15:33.580 --> 15:35.310
Today, the American people can be proud

15:35.310 --> 15:36.580
because this historical agreement

15:36.580 --> 15:38.590
is a tribute to American leadership.

15:38.590 --> 15:39.630
- Yeah, but what about-
- Mr. President,

15:39.630 --> 15:40.840
on the topic of oversight,

15:40.840 --> 15:42.100
the committee has threatened to subpoena

15:42.100 --> 15:44.410
the ethics department over
conflicts of interest.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.930
Do you think it's appropriate for Congress

15:45.930 --> 15:48.850
to be looking at the
comments made the ethics?

15:48.850 --> 15:51.270
- That is not today's subject.
I will not comment over it.

15:51.270 --> 15:52.423
Thank you everyone for coming out.

15:52.423 --> 15:53.429
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President,

15:53.429 --> 15:55.436
you didn't answer my questions.

15:55.436 --> 16:00.436
(gentle music)
(group applauding)

16:02.725 --> 16:05.040
- But you're gonna miss all my birthdays.

16:05.040 --> 16:08.012
- Mommy would never miss your
birthdays. I'll FaceTime you.

16:08.012 --> 16:10.268
- But who's gonna read my bedtime stories?

16:10.268 --> 16:12.003
- Don't worry, Mommy. I'm a big girl.

16:12.003 --> 16:14.526
I could take care of him.

16:14.526 --> 16:17.303
(crying)

16:17.303 --> 16:19.422
- You take care of my babies.

16:19.422 --> 16:20.287
- I will.

16:20.287 --> 16:22.870
(somber music)

16:30.473 --> 16:31.809
- I love you.

16:31.809 --> 16:33.457
(sobbing)

16:33.457 --> 16:34.363
- It's okay.

16:34.363 --> 16:36.318
(indistinct)

16:36.318 --> 16:38.179
I'll only be gone two years.

16:38.179 --> 16:40.929
(dramatic music)

16:43.061 --> 16:45.466
(indistinct)

16:45.466 --> 16:48.383
(crowd applauding)

16:52.869 --> 16:54.763
(dramatic music)

16:54.763 --> 16:56.243
(rumbling)

16:56.243 --> 16:59.160
(mysterious music)

17:30.014 --> 17:31.089
(chattering on intercom)

17:31.089 --> 17:32.449
- [Man] Discovery's onboard.

17:32.449 --> 17:34.087
This is our final deploy.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.628
(indistinct)

17:35.628 --> 17:38.641
(intense music)

17:38.641 --> 17:41.315
(fire roaring)
- 10, nine,

17:41.315 --> 17:42.815
eight, seven, six,

17:44.563 --> 17:46.063
five, four, three,

17:47.867 --> 17:48.700
two, one.

17:50.131 --> 17:50.964
Liftoff.

17:52.260 --> 17:57.260
(thunderous rumbling)
(intense music)

17:57.307 --> 18:00.242
- [Man] And liftoff for the
space shuttle Discovery,

18:00.242 --> 18:01.752
returning to the space station,

18:01.752 --> 18:04.352
paving the way for future
missions and beyond.

18:04.352 --> 18:09.352
(intense music)
(shuttle rumbling)

18:10.229 --> 18:13.146
(indistinct) Discovery's....

18:13.146 --> 18:13.979
Returning back...

18:13.979 --> 18:16.396
(indistinct)

18:25.476 --> 18:26.717
- [Newscaster] Bird's
eye view of Discovery

18:26.717 --> 18:28.093
as it races towards space.

18:28.093 --> 18:30.467
A star spangled start
to Discovery's mission.

18:30.467 --> 18:34.207
(mysterious music)

18:34.207 --> 18:35.907
Discovery's three
liquid-fueled main engines

18:35.907 --> 18:36.955
now travel back.

18:36.955 --> 18:39.872
(mysterious music)

18:45.619 --> 18:48.119
- This is some space station.

18:58.897 --> 19:02.410
Hi, Baby! I'm so excited
to see you on Tuesday!

19:02.410 --> 19:04.617
- [Girl] I miss you! I can't wait!

19:04.617 --> 19:07.341
- Oh, I miss you guys so much!

19:07.341 --> 19:08.748
- [Girl] Look what Billy made, Mom!

19:08.748 --> 19:10.335
Look what Billy made!

19:10.335 --> 19:12.292
- Error, transmission lost.
- Hello, hello,

19:12.292 --> 19:15.360
can you hear me?
- Error, transmission lost.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.610
(thunderous explosion)

19:21.732 --> 19:24.192
(intense music)

19:24.192 --> 19:26.942
(sparks zapping)

19:48.845 --> 19:51.512
(intense music)

20:09.228 --> 20:11.281
(thunderous explosion)

20:11.281 --> 20:12.114
- Damn.

20:12.114 --> 20:14.781
(intense music)

20:22.924 --> 20:24.091
What the hell?

20:24.963 --> 20:25.796
Oh, jeez.

20:27.379 --> 20:28.331
(thunderous explosion)

20:28.331 --> 20:29.820
Hobbs, this is General Thomas.

20:29.820 --> 20:32.203
- Hobbs, go on, general.

20:32.203 --> 20:33.840
- Page my staff and have them meet me

20:33.840 --> 20:36.330
at the shuttle launch facility, ASAP!

20:36.330 --> 20:37.914
Step on it!

20:37.914 --> 20:38.851
- Okay, sir.

20:38.851 --> 20:41.518
(intense music)

20:58.256 --> 21:01.083
(rumbling)

21:01.083 --> 21:04.416
(thunderous explosions)

21:15.513 --> 21:17.397
(engine starting)

21:17.397 --> 21:20.282
(tires screeching)

21:20.282 --> 21:22.949
(intense music)

21:43.707 --> 21:47.040
(thunderous explosion)

21:57.740 --> 22:01.073
(thunderous explosions)

22:36.552 --> 22:39.101
(shuttle rumbling)

22:39.101 --> 22:42.253
(thunderous explosions)

22:42.253 --> 22:44.920
(intense music)

23:00.543 --> 23:02.470
- Oh my God, what's going on?

23:02.470 --> 23:04.173
- Yo, we gotta do something!
- Oh my God!

23:04.173 --> 23:06.789
Oh my God! Somebody help!

23:06.789 --> 23:08.481
Somebody please!

23:08.481 --> 23:10.888
- No!
- Please help, help!

23:10.888 --> 23:12.460
Please!

23:12.460 --> 23:14.776
Do something! Help!

23:14.776 --> 23:16.416
Oh my God!

23:16.416 --> 23:19.083
(intense music)

23:23.526 --> 23:25.776
(whirring)

23:34.914 --> 23:37.081
(beeping)

23:41.887 --> 23:44.554
(intense music)

24:02.361 --> 24:04.694
(whirring)

24:23.270 --> 24:24.560
- This is your president.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.080
I have some sad news
for my fellow Americans.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.080
Our solar system is being destroyed,

24:29.080 --> 24:31.260
killing billions by a black hole.

24:31.260 --> 24:33.570
This ship is to carry
what is left of humanity

24:33.570 --> 24:36.955
toward the Kuiper Belt in
the Oort Cloud, light speed,

24:36.955 --> 24:38.570
(woman sobbing)
to exit the solar system

24:38.570 --> 24:39.550
forever.

24:39.550 --> 24:41.900
This is for the survival
of the human race.

24:41.900 --> 24:43.290
No one knew this was coming.

24:43.290 --> 24:46.290
It will be harder than ever to
keep humanity from perishing.

24:47.858 --> 24:50.608
(dramatic music)

24:52.580 --> 24:54.486
- You guys are gonna be okay.
- Are you two okay?

24:54.486 --> 24:56.643
(groaning)

24:56.643 --> 24:58.310
- Are you all right?

25:00.807 --> 25:01.719
- It was a bumpy ride.

25:01.719 --> 25:03.543
And now I'm just settling.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.293
Gotta clear my head.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.980
- Our entire solar system
was getting devoured

25:09.980 --> 25:11.563
by a black hole.

25:13.652 --> 25:16.243
Barely got away.

25:16.243 --> 25:18.380
- My family! My children!

25:18.380 --> 25:20.630
My husband, did you save them?

25:20.630 --> 25:22.293
- There wasn't enough time.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.133
Everyone on earth perished.

25:27.216 --> 25:31.583
- No! (sobbing)

25:35.310 --> 25:36.310
- I'm sorry.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.893
I'm very sorry for the
loss of your family.

25:43.537 --> 25:44.537
May I ask your name?

25:45.432 --> 25:48.400
- I-Illene. (sobbing)

25:48.400 --> 25:49.233
- Illene.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.160
I'm Lieutenant Jenkins.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.223
I'll be around if you need anything.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.650
Please, hang in there, Illene. Okay?

25:59.650 --> 26:00.741
Hang in there.

26:00.741 --> 26:02.074
(Illene sobbing)

26:02.074 --> 26:04.407
(whirring)

26:23.500 --> 26:25.870
- Dear residents of this
international mothership.

26:25.870 --> 26:28.460
I am so sorry for the many of your losses.

26:28.460 --> 26:29.480
Don't ever give up.

26:29.480 --> 26:32.090
Your families wouldn't
have wanted that right now.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.780
Even though we're at
such a huge loss of life,

26:34.780 --> 26:37.060
that doesn't mean we the people are safe.

26:37.060 --> 26:40.770
This ship must be maintained
until we can find a new home.

26:40.770 --> 26:42.970
Everyone must do their
part for the greater good

26:42.970 --> 26:44.030
of humanity.

26:44.030 --> 26:46.330
Again, I am sorry for everyone's losses.

26:46.330 --> 26:48.107
No one could have seen this coming.

26:53.901 --> 26:56.771
(gentle music)

26:56.771 --> 26:59.854
(footsteps tapping)

27:01.816 --> 27:02.816
- Roll call.

27:04.346 --> 27:05.179
Chow time.

27:06.929 --> 27:07.762
Line up.

27:28.420 --> 27:30.342
- This is nasty.

27:30.342 --> 27:33.509
- Gonna have to put something on this.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.792
(ominous music)

28:13.611 --> 28:16.611
(footsteps tapping)

28:18.118 --> 28:19.560
- Excuse me.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.050
What did I just see you do?

28:21.050 --> 28:23.343
I just seen you walk over to the machine.

28:24.393 --> 28:25.900
- Ah, nothing.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.360
- Yeah. You walked over there.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.720
What did you do? I seen what you did.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.143
You stole all the herbs.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.530
- For seasoning.

28:34.530 --> 28:37.740
- Yeah. Shut up, you.

28:40.004 --> 28:42.630
And you, put your food down right down.

28:46.160 --> 28:46.993
Let's go.

28:49.441 --> 28:51.153
You, get up now.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.750
Don't look at me like that.

28:55.750 --> 28:57.543
Walk that way now.

28:59.128 --> 28:59.961
Keep walking.

29:04.566 --> 29:09.566
(bright classical music)
(diners chattering)

29:24.825 --> 29:28.060
(ominous music)

29:28.060 --> 29:29.980
- It looks like people
are eating at restaurants.

29:29.980 --> 29:33.270
- Nevermind. Keep going.

29:33.270 --> 29:34.146
Go!

29:34.146 --> 29:37.210
(bright classical music)
(diners chattering)

29:37.210 --> 29:39.180
Don't worry about that.

29:39.180 --> 29:40.013
Keep going.

29:43.610 --> 29:44.443
Listen to me.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.513
You keep walking down the hallway.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.970
Keep going. I'll cuff you.

29:50.970 --> 29:52.147
Don't make me cuff you.

29:55.152 --> 29:57.549
(door whirring)

29:57.549 --> 30:00.299
(intense music)

30:08.910 --> 30:10.303
Keep walking, Miss Beckham.

30:11.220 --> 30:12.053
Come on.

30:15.816 --> 30:19.670
- Mrs. Beckham, do you
know why you're here?

30:19.670 --> 30:22.177
- I'm not quite sure what you mean.

30:22.177 --> 30:24.840
- Why you were brought
here? Do you know why?

30:24.840 --> 30:26.020
- No, I don't.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.940
- You we're caught stealing.

30:27.940 --> 30:31.540
Mrs. Beckham, let me
explain why that is a threat

30:31.540 --> 30:34.333
to the upkeep of everyone's survival.

30:35.860 --> 30:38.040
Every living thing on this ship

30:38.040 --> 30:42.840
including the food we grow has a purpose.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.200
It has a designated reason for being here

30:46.200 --> 30:48.253
or for being grown here.

30:50.710 --> 30:55.120
Even the smallest alteration
can have a ripple effect

30:55.120 --> 30:58.883
on our already fragile ecosystem.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.193
Do you understand?

31:02.620 --> 31:05.560
You're taking of extra food,

31:05.560 --> 31:08.320
even if it was just herbs,

31:08.320 --> 31:12.040
can cause someone else to go without.

31:12.040 --> 31:15.510
We need to work together

31:15.510 --> 31:19.563
to ensure everyone has
what they need to survive.

31:21.490 --> 31:23.700
- But what about those people I just saw

31:23.700 --> 31:25.320
eating at restaurants?

31:25.320 --> 31:28.016
They had salt and pepper on the table.

31:28.016 --> 31:31.350
- Oh, that's not real.

31:31.350 --> 31:34.650
That's just another test site on the ship.

31:34.650 --> 31:37.540
Tell you what, now that you know

31:37.540 --> 31:40.610
you can't just pick from the rations

31:40.610 --> 31:42.963
that feed the ship's populations,

31:43.890 --> 31:46.563
you won't do it again, will you?

31:48.600 --> 31:53.437
That is unless you want to
suffer the repercussions.

31:53.437 --> 31:56.230
- And what are the repercussions?

31:56.230 --> 31:58.060
- I don't know.

31:58.060 --> 32:00.583
That would be up to what the jury decides.

32:02.660 --> 32:03.693
- So prepared.

32:05.366 --> 32:07.140
- Now you know.

32:07.140 --> 32:10.940
The government put emergency
regulations in place

32:12.100 --> 32:16.103
to address extreme situations.

32:20.597 --> 32:21.430
Jenkins.

32:23.790 --> 32:24.623
- Ow!

32:27.630 --> 32:28.680
- Lieutenant Jenkins.

32:30.210 --> 32:32.543
You're to report to boardroom 716.

32:35.780 --> 32:36.762
- Yes, sir.

32:36.762 --> 32:39.429
(ominous music)

32:41.536 --> 32:43.200
(all laughing)

32:43.200 --> 32:46.617
(indistinct chattering)

32:48.430 --> 32:49.750
Ma'am.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.123
- How are your accommodations?

32:54.190 --> 32:56.143
- What?
- Aboard the ship?

32:57.420 --> 33:00.203
- My accommodations are fine, ma'am.

33:03.343 --> 33:05.760
(indistinct)

33:06.807 --> 33:09.518
(all chuckling)

33:09.518 --> 33:12.268
(ominous music)

33:15.500 --> 33:16.947
Pay attention to the screen.

33:21.480 --> 33:25.367
We cannot be weak and show
sympathy for the help.

33:25.367 --> 33:28.284
(group chuckling)

33:29.150 --> 33:32.620
They must work to sustain
not only themselves

33:33.840 --> 33:35.766
but the comforts of us.

33:35.766 --> 33:38.150
(group chuckling)

33:38.150 --> 33:39.503
And your family.

33:45.860 --> 33:48.283
You see what is wrong with this picture?

33:50.480 --> 33:53.380
Under no circumstances

33:53.380 --> 33:57.102
are you to take the
workers the scenic route.

33:57.102 --> 33:59.250
(group chuckling)

33:59.250 --> 34:02.082
They are not to see that
we are more comfortable

34:02.082 --> 34:03.249
than they are.

34:05.456 --> 34:07.310
Pull another stunt like that

34:08.547 --> 34:12.528
and we will throw you and
your family out the airlock.

34:12.528 --> 34:15.278
(group laughing)

34:16.491 --> 34:19.241
(ominous music)

34:20.920 --> 34:22.603
So do me a favor,

34:25.860 --> 34:27.890
think of your family

34:27.890 --> 34:29.843
next time you wanna show sympathy.

34:30.725 --> 34:33.558
(group laughing)

34:34.840 --> 34:36.500
- Yes, ma'am.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.793
I meant, Miss.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.893
- Don't just stand there.

34:44.170 --> 34:45.683
Get back to work.

34:47.250 --> 34:48.293
Commander,

34:51.330 --> 34:52.723
retrieve his sidearm.

34:58.570 --> 35:00.970
- Well, why?
- Give me your gun.

35:00.970 --> 35:01.803
- Why?

35:02.750 --> 35:05.250
(gun clacks)

35:07.842 --> 35:10.743
- Now get out and get back to work.

35:10.743 --> 35:13.493
(ominous music)

35:43.330 --> 35:46.928
- How we are surviving in
this tin can is beyond me.

35:46.928 --> 35:49.050
- The fusion panel's
hanging on by a thread

35:49.050 --> 35:51.350
on the starboard side of the ship!

35:51.350 --> 35:53.928
Nikki, it needs emergency maintenance!

35:53.928 --> 35:55.819
- In what section?

35:55.819 --> 35:58.970
- Sections S1, S14,

35:58.970 --> 36:00.863
shit, and S32!

36:06.490 --> 36:07.862
- Line everyone up.

36:07.862 --> 36:10.529
(intense music)

37:03.735 --> 37:07.472
- Do you even know what our
destination is, anyways?

37:07.472 --> 37:08.389
- No clue.

37:09.459 --> 37:11.151
- Good day, Mr President.

37:11.151 --> 37:13.930
(dramatic music)

37:13.930 --> 37:16.370
- We really don't have
much time for formalities.

37:16.370 --> 37:19.268
Does anyone have any
plans for our destination?

37:19.268 --> 37:20.823
- Well there lies the problem.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.363
Due to the direction which our
solar system was destroyed,

37:26.200 --> 37:27.990
we went in the opposite direction

37:27.990 --> 37:30.553
of our nearest solar
system, Alpha Centauri,

37:31.950 --> 37:34.300
which we would have arrived
in just a few months

37:34.300 --> 37:36.447
had we gone in that direction.

37:37.759 --> 37:39.920
- Can we turn this ship around?

37:39.920 --> 37:41.600
- We would be heading
in the same direction

37:41.600 --> 37:42.533
as the black hole.

37:43.720 --> 37:47.000
We have no way of gauging
its gravitational pull.

37:48.750 --> 37:51.180
- There's other avenues
we need to discuss.

37:51.180 --> 37:52.020
- Go on.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.542
- Well we're gonna still need
as far as where we're heading,

37:55.542 --> 37:56.375
if we wanna keep the ship up

37:56.375 --> 37:58.940
through the next couple of years, decades,

37:58.940 --> 38:00.070
or even centuries,

38:00.070 --> 38:02.890
we need to talk about controlled breeding

38:02.890 --> 38:04.710
and systematic training.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.796
- Are you saying we may never
reach a habitable planet

38:06.796 --> 38:07.859
in our lifetime?

38:07.859 --> 38:10.003
(dramatic music)

38:10.003 --> 38:13.380
- I don't know but we need to
be prepared for the unknown.

38:13.380 --> 38:15.360
If you look around,
the ship needs repairs,

38:15.360 --> 38:16.600
you know, inside and out.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.490
As we speak, we have people on the outside

38:18.490 --> 38:19.630
that are working at fixing it up.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.623
Again, I honestly don't know how long

38:21.623 --> 38:23.233
it's gonna last. Mr. President.

38:24.830 --> 38:26.343
- That is enough, John Leaf.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.060
We will stay ahead of the situation.

38:31.060 --> 38:34.357
We will send a memo of our
complete plan of the action.

38:36.824 --> 38:39.491
(intense music)

38:49.415 --> 38:51.582
(hissing)

38:52.609 --> 38:53.859
- What is that?

38:55.525 --> 38:57.775
(whirring)

39:04.600 --> 39:06.350
Oh my God, Asteroids!

39:07.275 --> 39:08.858
Take care of them!

39:10.255 --> 39:12.505
(whirring)

39:14.977 --> 39:18.227
(thunderous explosion)

39:20.328 --> 39:23.578
(thunderous explosion)

39:28.849 --> 39:32.435
(distorted voice)

39:32.435 --> 39:35.583
- You gotta get yourself
to the nearest hatch now!

39:35.583 --> 39:38.333
(intense music)

39:51.085 --> 39:52.242
- What was that?

39:52.242 --> 39:54.060
(ominous music)

39:54.060 --> 39:55.680
- We are still receiving reports

39:55.680 --> 39:58.050
from the engineering department.

39:58.050 --> 39:59.590
The one thing I can tell you

39:59.590 --> 40:02.445
is we have passed through
an asteroid field.

40:02.445 --> 40:07.445
(intense music)
(distorted voices)

40:28.051 --> 40:30.801
(doors hissing)

40:43.040 --> 40:44.710
- Guys we're losing power left and right!

40:44.710 --> 40:47.030
Sections are disappearing as we speak!

40:47.030 --> 40:48.084
There's all kind of...

40:48.084 --> 40:50.751
(intense music)

40:58.010 --> 41:00.310
- Everyone says taking
this ship is a mistake.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.910
- What are you talking about?

41:04.430 --> 41:05.547
- Don't you think it's shady how this ship

41:05.547 --> 41:07.333
was built in secret?

41:08.350 --> 41:11.203
With the capability of wiping
out our whole solar system?

41:12.660 --> 41:15.236
- I admit, it's a little convenient.

41:15.236 --> 41:16.640
- Shh!

41:16.640 --> 41:18.400
The security will hear you.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.870
That's another thing.

41:19.870 --> 41:22.360
We have armed guards
watching our every move

41:22.360 --> 41:23.823
like we're in prison.

41:25.915 --> 41:28.893
- Nikki, aren't you being
a little paranoid here?

41:30.630 --> 41:32.890
- Open your fucking eyes!

41:32.890 --> 41:35.303
I seen something different
out on the spacewalk.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.790
You see the shitty food
they're feeding us,

41:38.790 --> 41:40.700
those tight dorm rooms we're living in.

41:40.700 --> 41:43.000
I saw something different
outside of the ship.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.780
We're slaves!

41:47.780 --> 41:51.116
Come on, man. What are
we gonna do about it?

41:51.116 --> 41:53.191
We lost our whole entire family.

41:53.191 --> 41:56.024
(dramatic music)

42:21.140 --> 42:22.595
- What was that all about?

42:22.595 --> 42:24.410
- We can't even move up.

42:24.410 --> 42:25.410
- You're kidding me.

42:27.530 --> 42:30.870
- They're secure while we suffer!

42:30.870 --> 42:33.219
And our families are gone!

42:33.219 --> 42:35.427
(sobbing)

42:35.427 --> 42:38.070
(intense music)

42:38.070 --> 42:39.610
- I need Intel.

42:39.610 --> 42:41.690
I need to know where these
messages are coming from.

42:41.690 --> 42:44.070
And I need to know now!

42:44.070 --> 42:47.810
- For a short while our
communications were scrambled

42:47.810 --> 42:51.423
but our private programmers
have fixed all the issues.

42:52.410 --> 42:55.730
- Where are the messages coming from?

42:55.730 --> 42:59.733
- I said, the communication
scramble was fixed!

43:01.010 --> 43:03.720
We don't know the location of the origin.

43:03.720 --> 43:06.373
- More oxygen comes from
the botanical sector,

43:07.280 --> 43:09.040
and then it's pushed
through the rest of the ship

43:09.040 --> 43:11.220
by the engineering department.

43:11.220 --> 43:13.120
- My entire family just
watched their lives

43:13.120 --> 43:15.880
being interrupted on a televised
broadcast on this ship.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.190
What the hell is going on here?

43:17.190 --> 43:18.080
The entire upper class
- Mr. President,

43:18.080 --> 43:19.602
was in a panic.
- we have the best-

43:19.602 --> 43:21.750
- Group workers are not happy.

43:21.750 --> 43:23.500
My suggestion is that we negotiate.

43:24.440 --> 43:25.914
- John Leaf, we do not
negotiate with terrorists.

43:25.914 --> 43:27.090
- Mrs. McMichaels, is there something

43:27.090 --> 43:29.020
that can be done
peacefully to resolve this?

43:29.020 --> 43:31.211
- May I suggest, Mr. President, that we-

43:31.211 --> 43:32.088
- What is your name, sir?

43:32.088 --> 43:34.138
- My name, Mr. President,

43:34.138 --> 43:36.280
- Ruin the course of justice.
- is John Leaf.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.280
Lives are at stake!

43:38.280 --> 43:40.238
- Which will be dealt with swiftly.

43:40.238 --> 43:42.988
(intense music)

43:46.290 --> 43:47.430
I would need you to

43:49.370 --> 43:53.527
grant a seek and destroy
initiative, Mr. President,

43:53.527 --> 43:57.859
if you'd like these
pests to be eradicated.

43:57.859 --> 44:00.609
(intense music)

44:02.000 --> 44:04.130
- We will go with Mr. Leaf's suggestion.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.523
- You're all dismissed.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.660
Except for you.

44:29.660 --> 44:32.410
(intense music)

44:38.730 --> 44:42.093
You served with my father at the Pentagon.

44:43.550 --> 44:44.920
- Yes, ma'am.

44:44.920 --> 44:47.970
Sorry he couldn't make it
as one of the survivors

44:47.970 --> 44:50.264
on this ship.
- Yes,

44:50.264 --> 44:52.013
it was a real loss.

44:55.850 --> 44:58.623
I need you to dispose of somebody for me.

45:01.350 --> 45:02.373
- Consider it done.

45:06.090 --> 45:09.709
- Make it look like an act of terrorists.

45:09.709 --> 45:11.709
- Do you know who it is?

45:14.478 --> 45:15.584
- John Leaf.

45:15.584 --> 45:18.251
(ominous music)

45:22.272 --> 45:24.855
(ice clinking)

46:09.580 --> 46:11.487
(pump clicks)

46:11.487 --> 46:14.518
(gun clattering)

46:14.518 --> 46:15.351
(pot bangs)

46:15.351 --> 46:18.018
(intense music)

46:37.715 --> 46:40.132
(neck snaps)

46:46.255 --> 46:48.672
(body thuds)

47:01.842 --> 47:04.509
(doors hissing)

47:05.655 --> 47:08.322
(intense music)

47:11.964 --> 47:14.631
(doors hissing)

47:19.922 --> 47:21.528
(machinery whirring)

47:21.528 --> 47:23.840
- You finally get to see what happens

47:23.840 --> 47:26.173
when people break the rules.

47:28.946 --> 47:30.376
- No, no!
- What's going on here?

47:30.376 --> 47:31.526
- No!
- No!

47:31.526 --> 47:33.101
- Stop!
- What's going on?

47:33.101 --> 47:34.324
- No, stop!
- Let her go.

47:34.324 --> 47:35.468
This isn't right.
- What are you doing?

47:35.468 --> 47:36.307
Let her go.
- Quiet.

47:36.307 --> 47:37.650
Come on.

47:37.650 --> 47:39.366
- Let her go, no!
- This isn't fair.

47:39.366 --> 47:40.549
- Don't do this.

47:40.549 --> 47:42.089
(indistinct)

47:42.089 --> 47:43.677
- No, let her go!

47:43.677 --> 47:46.427
(intense music)

47:47.860 --> 47:48.693
- Wait.

47:50.370 --> 47:53.670
I want Lieutenant Jenkins to do the deed.

47:53.670 --> 47:56.420
(intense music)

48:01.230 --> 48:02.280
- Lieutenant Jenkins.

48:03.600 --> 48:04.790
Front and center.

48:09.570 --> 48:10.437
- Yes, sir.

48:10.437 --> 48:13.245
(machinery whirring)

48:13.245 --> 48:16.245
(suspenseful music)

48:17.448 --> 48:18.800
- Your sidearm.

48:21.497 --> 48:23.113
- Please don't do this.

48:25.880 --> 48:27.713
- Lieutenant Jenkins.

48:28.740 --> 48:31.050
I want you to repeat after me

48:31.050 --> 48:32.903
and listen very carefully.

48:34.900 --> 48:39.400
To those involved in acts of terrorism

48:39.400 --> 48:42.534
against our communications system.

48:42.534 --> 48:45.604
(Illene sobbing)

48:45.604 --> 48:48.353
- To those that were involved

48:48.353 --> 48:52.460
- Please, don't do this!
- in acts of terrorism

48:52.460 --> 48:54.763
against our communications system.

48:57.230 --> 48:59.073
This is how we negotiate.

49:01.548 --> 49:04.214
- Please don't.

49:04.214 --> 49:05.679
- Everyone against the wall!
- Against the wall!

49:05.679 --> 49:07.116
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Against the wall!

49:07.116 --> 49:09.356
- Move it!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

49:09.356 --> 49:11.089
- You motherfucker.
Get down, motherfucker.

49:11.089 --> 49:12.275
Get down.
- Oh, oh!

49:12.275 --> 49:14.093
- No!
- Get on your knees.

49:14.093 --> 49:15.245
- No, don't.

49:15.245 --> 49:17.395
- For those of you
committing acts of terrorism

49:17.395 --> 49:19.067
against our communications system,

49:19.067 --> 49:21.100
this is how we do business.

49:21.100 --> 49:22.519
- Please sir, don't!
- Don't, no!

49:22.519 --> 49:23.933
- I didn't do anything, please!

49:23.933 --> 49:24.997
- Shut up.

49:24.997 --> 49:27.968
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

49:27.968 --> 49:29.837
To those of you committing
acts of terrorism

49:29.837 --> 49:31.922
against this communications network,

49:31.922 --> 49:33.342
this is how we do business.

49:33.342 --> 49:34.609
- Please sir, don't!
- You don't have to do this.

49:34.609 --> 49:35.442
- Shut up.
- I didn't do anything!

49:35.442 --> 49:37.230
Please!
- Now let this young man

49:37.230 --> 49:39.210
be an example to what'll happen

49:39.210 --> 49:41.344
if you put us in jeopardy on this shop.

49:41.344 --> 49:42.232
- Goddamn!

49:42.232 --> 49:43.455
(gun fires)

49:43.455 --> 49:46.122
(intense music)

49:49.306 --> 49:51.479
- This is how we negotiate.

49:51.479 --> 49:53.646
(sobbing)

49:55.810 --> 49:57.773
- Now kill the prisoner.

50:05.080 --> 50:06.888
- I can't do this.

50:06.888 --> 50:08.550
I can't do this.

50:08.550 --> 50:09.700
- Please don't kill me.

50:12.680 --> 50:16.340
- Remember our brief
conversation from before?

50:16.340 --> 50:20.520
I will throw you and your
family out of the air lock

50:20.520 --> 50:22.513
like yesterday's garbage.

50:23.540 --> 50:24.927
- I can't do this.
- You will follow orders.

50:24.927 --> 50:26.400
- Please don't kill me.

50:26.400 --> 50:29.148
- Now kill that prisoner!

50:29.148 --> 50:30.550
- Please.

50:30.550 --> 50:31.450
I don't wanna die.

50:33.710 --> 50:38.620
- Security, go retrieve
Lieutenant Jenkins family

50:39.470 --> 50:41.407
and escort them to the air lock.

50:42.310 --> 50:43.610
- No, wait!

50:43.610 --> 50:45.655
Wait, I'll do it.

50:45.655 --> 50:47.098
- Please.
- I'll do it.

50:47.098 --> 50:49.971
- Please, please.
- Don't look at me!

50:49.971 --> 50:50.999
(fist whacks)

50:50.999 --> 50:53.749
(dramatic music)

51:04.289 --> 51:05.122
(gun fires)
(Illene screams)

51:05.122 --> 51:07.872
(Illene sobbing)

51:13.240 --> 51:14.888
- Good job, lieutenant.

51:14.888 --> 51:17.638
(dramatic music)

51:19.726 --> 51:21.726
- Illene, I am so sorry.

51:23.810 --> 51:25.010
I'm sorry, Illene.

51:41.313 --> 51:44.589
(machine whirring)

51:44.589 --> 51:47.422
(dramatic music)

52:05.960 --> 52:08.008
- Taking a stand tonight.

52:08.008 --> 52:09.643
- I don't think you should do it.

52:10.670 --> 52:12.183
- I can't live like this.

52:13.286 --> 52:16.437
- I don't think you should do it.

52:16.437 --> 52:17.603
- I want in.

52:20.330 --> 52:23.438
They killed my best friend
because of something I did!

52:23.438 --> 52:26.271
(dramatic music)

52:33.877 --> 52:37.490
- You see, Mr. President,
everything is back in order.

52:37.490 --> 52:38.503
- Where is Mr. Leaf?

52:38.503 --> 52:41.336
(dramatic music)

52:43.330 --> 52:46.620
- Unfortunately, there
was a terrorist attack

52:46.620 --> 52:49.067
in the living quarters.

52:49.067 --> 52:51.150
He could not be revived.

52:52.216 --> 52:56.113
However, we did negotiate
with the terrorists.

52:58.340 --> 52:59.913
We came to an agreement.

53:04.100 --> 53:05.873
We are all safe now.

53:07.230 --> 53:08.680
That is all you need to know.

53:14.480 --> 53:16.634
- Excuse me. ID.

53:16.634 --> 53:19.482
(machines whirring)

53:19.482 --> 53:22.232
(ominous music)

53:24.750 --> 53:26.890
- The west wing. There's a bridge.

53:26.890 --> 53:28.862
She's here for maintenance.

53:28.862 --> 53:30.428
- Hmm.

53:30.428 --> 53:33.750
(machines whirring)

53:33.750 --> 53:34.583
Go.

53:40.054 --> 53:43.650
- So what's your plan? Is
your team working on anything?

53:43.650 --> 53:46.590
- My team is working on assets passed

53:48.550 --> 53:50.383
for corporates data bridge sheets.

53:51.364 --> 53:53.382
- Why can't we just turn up the air?

53:53.382 --> 53:55.043
- Because that would be complicated.

53:55.043 --> 53:57.623
We can only shut it
down for a little while.

53:59.130 --> 54:01.517
No, we have to get the people

54:01.517 --> 54:03.367
who are actually pulling the strings.

54:04.442 --> 54:06.524
- We have to pull the strings.

54:06.524 --> 54:07.673
- Yeah. We do.

54:07.673 --> 54:10.899
(intense music)

54:10.899 --> 54:12.260
- What do you have in there?

54:12.260 --> 54:15.927
- It's walkie-talkies
so we can communicate.

54:20.171 --> 54:21.988
Make sure you communicate with this.

54:21.988 --> 54:23.571
- Yes. I have mine.

54:30.847 --> 54:32.853
- You two are awfully chatty.

54:35.580 --> 54:38.530
Miss Beckham, you know the rules.

54:38.530 --> 54:39.380
Get back to work.

54:41.244 --> 54:42.944
Or do you wanna wind up-

54:42.944 --> 54:45.527
- Like my best friend you shot?

54:48.228 --> 54:49.728
- I had my orders.

54:51.090 --> 54:52.470
Just get back to work.

54:54.470 --> 54:56.767
I wouldn't wanna wind up like her too.

54:58.883 --> 55:00.617
- Get out of my way.

55:00.617 --> 55:03.284
(intense music)

55:05.894 --> 55:07.061
- Here you go.

55:08.290 --> 55:09.340
- So here's the plan.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.900
You guys are gonna power
down the security system

55:12.900 --> 55:15.550
which will give us about an
hour to take out our oppressors.

55:15.550 --> 55:18.234
Team two is gonna take out the boardroom.

55:18.234 --> 55:21.265
- Wait a minute, like
what are you planning?

55:21.265 --> 55:23.492
- I have my own secret assignment.

55:23.492 --> 55:24.967
- But what are you planning on doing?

55:24.967 --> 55:26.384
- It's a secret.

55:28.524 --> 55:30.357
Everybody get to work.

55:31.197 --> 55:32.430
Illene, you there?

55:32.430 --> 55:34.380
(machines whirring)
- Yes.

55:34.380 --> 55:37.073
- Get you and your team
to a secure location.

55:40.420 --> 55:41.640
During the food run,

55:41.640 --> 55:44.400
please check for weapon parts.

55:44.400 --> 55:46.650
The rest, you'll obtain
while you're at work.

55:48.015 --> 55:49.204
- 10-4.

55:49.204 --> 55:51.199
(machines whirring)

55:51.199 --> 55:53.709
- Come over here, one moment.

55:53.709 --> 55:55.959
- Illene, get back to work.

55:57.589 --> 56:00.002
- I'm trying to report a
maintenance issue over here.

56:00.002 --> 56:02.669
(ominous music)

56:05.463 --> 56:08.300
(machines whirring)

56:08.300 --> 56:11.967
(door hissing and clanking)

56:25.594 --> 56:27.061
(zapping)

56:27.061 --> 56:29.728
(intense music)

56:36.480 --> 56:38.270
Okay, he's down.

56:38.270 --> 56:39.103
Now what?

56:43.590 --> 56:47.110
- Now we must discuss the
building of our new structure

56:47.110 --> 56:48.940
from the meteor debris that was salvaged

56:48.940 --> 56:51.852
from being lodged in our ship.

56:51.852 --> 56:53.630
(door hissing)

56:53.630 --> 56:57.163
May I suggest a new probe launching area?

57:04.660 --> 57:05.670
What may I help you with?

57:05.670 --> 57:07.920
- Yes, there's a couple
of people on the ship

57:07.920 --> 57:10.680
trying to do some stuff.

57:10.680 --> 57:14.603
- Well if this is true, excuse my French,

57:16.020 --> 57:18.053
but they're fucking stupid.

57:19.357 --> 57:21.230
- No, no, there's a couple of people

57:21.230 --> 57:23.174
trying to take over the ship.

57:23.174 --> 57:26.187
And murdered a couple
of people on the ship.

57:26.187 --> 57:27.312
- Tell me everything.

57:27.312 --> 57:30.062
(dramatic music)

57:38.265 --> 57:39.520
(groaning)

57:39.520 --> 57:42.187
(intense music)

57:49.281 --> 57:50.941
(screaming)

57:50.941 --> 57:53.139
- Yo, he's alive!

57:53.139 --> 57:54.139
- Let me go!

58:01.790 --> 58:04.873
(gasping) Let me go!

58:09.151 --> 58:11.320
Don't kill me. I have family.

58:11.320 --> 58:15.570
- But Jan said those exact
same words and shot her!

58:18.113 --> 58:19.803
This is too easy.

58:22.347 --> 58:24.723
- Look, let me go,

58:26.161 --> 58:30.803
and I won't retaliate
or file a report on ya.

58:30.803 --> 58:33.720
- I'll give you two choices.

58:33.720 --> 58:36.943
Either you die or your family dies!

58:36.943 --> 58:37.776
- What?

58:39.040 --> 58:40.933
What kind of choices is that?

58:43.330 --> 58:46.563
They made me kill your friends.

58:48.630 --> 58:49.493
I'm sorry.

58:50.960 --> 58:52.540
Please.

58:52.540 --> 58:54.678
Don't make me choose. Don't.

58:54.678 --> 58:55.788
- Go get,

58:55.788 --> 58:57.640
get his family.

58:57.640 --> 58:59.010
- I'm sorry.

58:59.010 --> 59:01.177
Please. Don't make me choose.

59:01.177 --> 59:02.344
Don't, don't!

59:03.580 --> 59:04.507
No.

59:04.507 --> 59:07.610
(dramatic music)

59:07.610 --> 59:08.443
Wait!

59:10.371 --> 59:11.288
I'll do it.

59:12.807 --> 59:14.807
I'll die for my family.

59:16.757 --> 59:18.740
- I figured you would say that.

59:18.740 --> 59:20.950
That's why my team is
on the way to get them.

59:20.950 --> 59:22.493
So you can say goodbye!

59:29.280 --> 59:31.883
- Sorry to spoil your plans.

59:33.060 --> 59:34.623
A thank you to your friend.

59:36.830 --> 59:37.950
- You're a fool!

59:37.950 --> 59:40.810
You need us to sustain the ship!

59:40.810 --> 59:41.990
- There are some of you.

59:41.990 --> 59:44.563
Not putting everyone's lives at stake.

59:46.460 --> 59:49.383
Anyway, we don't need people like you.

59:52.120 --> 59:54.713
Anyway, hold your breath.

59:58.610 --> 1:00:02.060
You can thank the workers.
still maintaining the ship

1:00:02.060 --> 1:00:03.703
for your lack of oxygen.

1:00:05.873 --> 1:00:07.619
- [All] Daddy!

1:00:07.619 --> 1:00:08.619
- Oh my God.

1:00:09.578 --> 1:00:11.407
I missed you guys so much.

1:00:11.407 --> 1:00:14.157
(dramatic music)

1:00:15.076 --> 1:00:15.909
Listen.

1:00:17.190 --> 1:00:19.102
Daddy has to go away now.

1:00:19.102 --> 1:00:22.308
- No, Daddy!
- No, Daddy, don't go!

1:00:22.308 --> 1:00:23.391
- I have to.

1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:25.523
Just remember.

1:00:27.570 --> 1:00:29.058
I'll always love you guys.

1:00:29.058 --> 1:00:31.891
(dramatic music)

1:00:32.889 --> 1:00:34.306
Honey. Oh my God.

1:00:37.247 --> 1:00:38.080
Honey.

1:00:39.778 --> 1:00:40.695
I love you.

1:00:43.295 --> 1:00:44.212
- No.
- No!

1:00:45.098 --> 1:00:46.015
- Don't go!

1:00:46.942 --> 1:00:49.213
- No!
- No, please!

1:00:49.213 --> 1:00:50.046
- No!
- No!

1:00:51.281 --> 1:00:52.685
No!

1:00:52.685 --> 1:00:55.518
(dramatic music)

1:00:59.481 --> 1:01:00.314
No.

1:01:02.630 --> 1:01:03.533
I want my family.

1:01:06.257 --> 1:01:09.007
(dramatic music)

1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:14.963
Please, no!

1:01:16.571 --> 1:01:18.127
I don't wanna die, no!

1:01:30.550 --> 1:01:31.597
Please, don't!

1:01:31.597 --> 1:01:33.070
(gentle piano music)

1:01:33.070 --> 1:01:34.527
I don't wanna die. No.

1:01:35.755 --> 1:01:36.922
Don't do this.

1:02:15.351 --> 1:02:18.184
(dramatic music)

1:02:25.550 --> 1:02:29.333
- The terrorist numbers were
larger than we anticipated.

1:02:30.889 --> 1:02:32.663
- You need to get this under contro...

1:02:32.663 --> 1:02:35.330
(ominous music)

1:02:43.605 --> 1:02:44.688
- I see you.

1:02:51.569 --> 1:02:54.057
The president is dead!

1:02:54.057 --> 1:02:57.810
And now we the people on
this ship are taking over.

1:02:57.810 --> 1:03:00.437
I want everyone to get
into their rightful places.
