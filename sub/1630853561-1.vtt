I must inform you
that it is my intention

05:49.292 --> 05:52.375
to refuse to perform
any further military duties.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.167
I am doing this as a protest

05:55.208 --> 05:57.000
against the policy
of the government

05:57.042 --> 05:58.417
in prolonging the war

I am making this statement

06:09.792 --> 06:13.000
as an act of wilful defiance
of military authority

06:13.042 --> 06:14.583
because I believe that the war

06:14.625 --> 06:16.375
is being
deliberately prolonged

06:16.417 --> 06:19.000
by those who have
the power to end it.

I am a soldier

06:22.167 --> 06:26.292

on behalf of soldiers.

upon which I entered

06:28.625 --> 06:31.750
as a war of defence
and liberation

06:31.792 --> 06:35.875
has now become a war
of aggression and conquest.

which I and my fellow soldiers

06:38.875 --> 06:40.125
entered upon this war

06:40.167 --> 06:42.292
should have been
made so clearly stated

as to have made it impossible
to change them.

16:01.292 --> 16:04.417
Your duty lies
in obeying orders.

16:04.958 --> 16:06.042
Duty?

16:07.792 --> 16:10.250
That word covers
a multitude of sins.

16:11.292 --> 16:12.667
In the face of such slaughter,

16:12.708 --> 16:15.500
one cannot simply
order one's conscience.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.208
One can do better than that.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.083
One can ignore it.

16:20.125 --> 16:22.750
That reply was so disgraceful,
you ought to be in politics.

16:22.792 --> 16:25.125
That was impertinent,
Lieutenant.

16:27.458 --> 16:30.250
Are you pro-German?

16:30.292 --> 16:31.875
No. I'm pro-human.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.917
We are not here
to discuss humanity,

16:33.958 --> 16:36.583
that is religion's sphere
of operations.

16:36.625 --> 16:37.750
And what of morality?

16:37.792 --> 16:39.542
Morality is a luxury

16:39.583 --> 16:41.833
that we can only afford
during peace time.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.875
I would be very grateful
if you would take

16:43.917 --> 16:47.375
that offensive tone
out of your voice.

16:47.417 --> 16:50.417
Voices raised in anger
only perpetuates war.

16:50.458 --> 16:54.250
And passive resistance
only invites defeat.

16:58.792 --> 17:00.292
I simply cannot remain silent

17:00.333 --> 17:02.083
in the face
of such casualties.

17:04.041 --> 17:07.083
Someone must,
should be brought to book.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.041
The casualties, young man,

17:09.083 --> 17:12.000
are a matter for the
Imperial General Staff.

17:12.041 --> 17:16.083
And your statement,
indeed your entire attitude,

17:16.125 --> 17:17.291
is both offensive

17:17.333 --> 17:19.500
and detrimental
to military discipline.

17:19.541 --> 17:20.833
My colleague is quite right.

17:20.875 --> 17:23.041
It is not your place
to question your superiors,

17:23.083 --> 17:26.375
much less to imply
that they are not honourable.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.583
Perhaps, sir,
if you, if any of you

17:28.625 --> 17:30.750
were to visit the front,

17:30.792 --> 17:32.208
then you might at least
spare a thought

17:32.250 --> 17:35.500
for the many bereaved families
and the pain they suffer.

17:35.542 --> 17:39.167
You are out of order, sir!

17:39.208 --> 17:40.500
I thought that was
the very reason

17:40.542 --> 17:42.625
for my being
brought before you.

17:42.667 --> 17:43.875
This has gone far enough.

-(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
-Yes, of course.

17:53.167 --> 17:54.750
Myself and my fellow officers

17:54.792 --> 17:56.458

is still in chaos

17:56.500 --> 18:00.125
and that you are unfit to be
trusted with men's lives.

18:00.167 --> 18:01.542
It is therefore
the Board's decision

18:01.583 --> 18:02.917
that you should
be sent to a hospital

18:02.958 --> 18:05.042
for nervous diseases
in Scotland.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.708
We therefore order you
to report immediately

MATRON: Morphine.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.417
Morphine?

19:38.458 --> 19:40.875
The dots denote that
they've had their doses,

19:58.250 --> 20:00.667

the hospital grounds.

20:00.708 --> 20:04.333
It is to show that you are

a conscientious objector.

too inhibited.

30:44.250 --> 30:46.083
Shamed by an inner corruption.

30:49.042 --> 30:50.792
Or perhaps
it's simply because of...

You are not alone
in that respect.

Well, sir, I think
they help to give

I'm just being syndromatic.

but I said I wasn't sure.

49:20.125 --> 49:23.625
One day, Robbie,
you will go too far.

49:23.667 --> 49:26.417
Oh, one day, Sybil,
we will all go too far.

49:28.167 --> 49:30.542
Thank you for coming,
Mr Sassoon.

49:30.583 --> 49:34.417
We're all very eager
to hear your recitation.

49:34.458 --> 49:37.167
-Thank you, Lady Colefax.
-(APPLAUSE)

49:42.917 --> 49:47.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
pray silence for

49:47.292 --> 49:52.292
one of our greatest poets,
Mr Siegfried Sassoon.

49:59.500 --> 50:00.500
(CLEARS THROAT)

50:05.083 --> 50:06.875
When I'm among
a blaze of lights,

50:08.458 --> 50:11.292
with tawdry music and cigars

50:12.708 --> 50:15.375
and women dawdling
through delights

50:16.583 --> 50:18.792
and officers in cocktail bars,

50:20.042 --> 50:22.208
sometimes I think
of garden nights

50:24.250 --> 50:26.583
and elm trees
nodding at the stars.

50:28.583 --> 50:30.875
I dream of a small
fire-lit room.

50:32.208 --> 50:34.333
Yellow candles
burning straight,

50:35.792 --> 50:37.750
and glowing pictures
in the gloom,

50:38.750 --> 50:41.083
and kindly books
that hold me late.

50:43.417 --> 50:45.083
Of things like these
I choose to think

50:45.125 --> 50:46.708
when I can never be alone.

50:49.125 --> 50:51.417
And then someone says,
"Another drink,"

50:52.750 --> 50:55.750
and turns my living heart
to stone.

51:01.583 --> 51:04.458
-Hmm.
-(APPLAUSE)

51:09.167 --> 51:10.750
Thank you, Mr Sassoon.

51:11.500 --> 51:13.833
That was very touching.

51:13.875 --> 51:15.208
We both thank you, Sybil,

51:15.250 --> 51:17.083
and now go
and rejoin Lady Cunard

51:17.125 --> 51:18.917
before she starts
launching something.

51:18.958 --> 51:20.000
(CHUCKLES)

51:29.542 --> 51:31.125
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

51:31.167 --> 51:35.000
And to think he once played
the triangle so beautifully.

51:35.042 --> 51:37.208
-What a waste. (LAUGHING)
-(PIANO PLAYING)

51:37.250 --> 51:41.333
(SINGING) I seem to be
the victim of a cruel jest

51:41.375 --> 51:42.792
(FAINT LAUGHTER)

51:42.833 --> 51:48.333
It dogs my footsteps with
the girl I love the best

51:48.375 --> 51:54.625
She's just the sweetest thing
that I have ever known

51:54.667 --> 52:00.792
And yet we never get
the chance to be alone

52:00.833 --> 52:05.833
My car will meet her
and her mother comes, too

52:05.875 --> 52:07.208
(FAINT LAUGHTER)

52:07.250 --> 52:12.542
It's a two-seater
Still her mother comes, too

52:12.583 --> 52:18.292
At Ciro's when I am free
at dinner, supper or tea

52:18.333 --> 52:21.583
She loves to shimmy with me

52:21.625 --> 52:23.333
And her mother does, too

52:23.375 --> 52:24.708
(FAINT LAUGHTER)

52:24.750 --> 52:30.417
We buy her trousseau
And her mother comes, too

52:30.458 --> 52:36.583
Asked not to do so
Still her mother comes, too

52:36.625 --> 52:42.500
She simply can't take a snub
I go and sulk at the club

52:42.542 --> 52:47.167
Then have a bath and a rub
And her brother comes, too

52:47.208 --> 52:48.708
(LAUGHTER)

52:48.750 --> 52:53.667
To golf we started
And her mother came, too

52:54.458 --> 52:56.750
Three bags I carted

52:57.750 --> 53:00.667
When her mother came, too

53:00.708 --> 53:03.792
She fainted just off the tee

53:03.833 --> 53:07.208
My darling whispered to me

53:07.250 --> 53:10.708
"Jack dear, at last
we are free"

53:12.125 --> 53:13.583
But her mother came, too

53:13.625 --> 53:15.292
(LAUGHTER)

53:15.333 --> 53:17.417
(APPLAUSE)

53:19.583 --> 53:22.125
ROSS: He is considered
very beautiful.

53:22.167 --> 53:23.875
Look at those shoulders.

53:24.750 --> 53:27.792
Yeah, and look at his.

53:36.625 --> 53:38.292
No, precious.

53:38.333 --> 53:41.125
I'm anxious to meet
our distinguished guest,

53:41.167 --> 53:43.000
Mr Sassoon.

53:43.042 --> 53:45.208
I'm eager to have your advice
on my next musical.

53:45.250 --> 53:48.292
I'm thinking of writing
in terza rima.

53:48.333 --> 53:50.208
That's near Naples, isn't it?

53:51.208 --> 53:52.708
Oh, dear Robbie,

53:52.750 --> 53:53.917
whose silences are always

53:53.958 --> 53:56.417
so much more eloquent
than speech.

53:58.458 --> 53:59.458
(GLEN SNORTS)

54:09.417 --> 54:11.750
Robbie will give you a paw
to guide you home, Glen.

-C'est la vie.

(IVOR BREATHING HEAVILY)

54:52.542 --> 54:54.667
Oops.

54:54.708 --> 54:59.208
Just leave the keys
on the dresser, Glen.

55:00.792 --> 55:04.792
You know how absent-minded
I am with them.

(CIGARETTE CASE SNAPS)

55:37.958 --> 55:39.750
I think he's still
in love with you.

55:40.625 --> 55:42.667
The main drawback with love

55:42.708 --> 55:44.500
is that it descends,
all too quickly,

55:44.542 --> 55:45.875
into possessiveness.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.583
That really is a bore.

55:58.083 --> 55:59.625
What shall I do with these?

55:59.667 --> 56:02.208
Oh, they're for you.

56:34.583 --> 56:36.292
Hamo died so far away.

56:37.500 --> 56:40.417
While I have his sword,
I still have him.

56:42.708 --> 56:45.250
We never grieved
properly for him, Mother.

56:46.583 --> 56:48.542
Before grief, there's anger.

on your constant way,

57:00.708 --> 57:03.417
in selfless duty
long grown grey.

57:04.875 --> 57:06.042
and to myself,

57:06.083 --> 57:08.750
I say that I have
lived my life to learn

57:08.792 --> 57:12.167
how lives like your
unasking earn.

57:12.208 --> 57:16.000
Aureoles that guide and burn

57:16.042 --> 57:17.667
in heart's remembrance

57:17.708 --> 57:20.500
when the proud who snared
the suffrage of the crowd

57:20.542 --> 57:24.250
are dumb and dusty browed.

57:24.292 --> 57:27.542
For you live onward
in my thought

57:27.583 --> 57:31.375
because you have not sought
rewards that can be bought.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.875
And so when I remember you,

57:35.917 --> 57:38.458
I think of all things
rich and true

57:38.500 --> 57:40.750
that I have reaped
and wrought.

57:44.792 --> 57:46.542
Thank God you survived.

57:57.542 --> 57:58.542
Good night, darling.

57:59.708 --> 58:00.708
Good night, Mother.

58:12.583 --> 58:14.917
Give me your hand, my brother.

58:15.833 --> 58:17.167
Search my face.

58:18.708 --> 58:21.542
Look in these eyes
lest I should think of shame.

58:22.875 --> 58:25.542
For we have made an end
of all things base.

58:26.708 --> 58:29.167
We are returning
by the road we came.

58:30.583 --> 58:34.625
Your lot is with the ghosts
of soldiers dead,

58:34.667 --> 58:37.083
and I am in the field
where men must fight.

58:38.875 --> 58:41.292
But in the gloom,
I see your laurelled head

58:41.333 --> 58:45.083
and through your victory
I shall win the light.

-The Pope.

That's right, Siegfried,

What would you have done
if Royalty had paid a call?

1:00:15.458 --> 1:00:16.792
Oh, well, then I'd
have tried to curtsey

-from a sitting position.
-(LAUGHS)

1:00:19.917 --> 1:00:21.667
Speaking of Royalty,
I've come with a command

1:00:21.708 --> 1:00:25.500
from Her Majesty
Edith Sitwell.

1:00:25.542 --> 1:00:26.583
You are to attend
a performance

1:00:34.917 --> 1:00:35.958
I've gone
to a great deal of trouble

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.167
to get this
so don't let me down.

to come to your flat

1:00:41.375 --> 1:00:42.708

1:00:55.208 --> 1:00:56.208
How was she?

1:00:57.667 --> 1:00:59.583
Let's just say I've always
found lime green

1:00:59.625 --> 1:01:01.208
a very unforgiving colour.

1:01:01.250 --> 1:01:02.625

1:01:03.167 --> 1:01:04.917
Poor Ottoline.

1:01:04.958 --> 1:01:06.958

to meeting your mother.

1:01:13.167 --> 1:01:14.542

1:01:14.583 --> 1:01:17.667
I said I was looking forward
to meeting your mother.

1:01:21.833 --> 1:01:23.333
are always fascinating.

for you on the floor.

Oh, it'll be from Robbie Ross.

1:01:43.333 --> 1:01:45.292
Why are you so antipathetic
towards him?

1:01:45.333 --> 1:01:48.417
Because I resent the way
that he speaks to me.

1:01:48.458 --> 1:01:50.750
Like he's always
putting me in my place.

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:54.292
You know, the only problem
with knowing one's place

1:01:54.333 --> 1:01:56.375
is that other people
never seem to know theirs.

1:01:56.417 --> 1:01:58.125
(LAUGHS)

1:01:58.167 --> 1:02:00.542
He's acerbic, I grant you,
but he's never malign,

1:02:01.583 --> 1:02:04.042
and as a friend,
very steadfast.

1:02:04.083 --> 1:02:05.625
Robbie Ross took
some considerable risk

1:02:05.667 --> 1:02:07.625
when he publicly supported
Oscar Wilde.

1:02:07.667 --> 1:02:09.875
He's been hounded ever since
by Lord Alfred Douglas.

1:02:09.917 --> 1:02:12.875
Oh, please,
Bosie was always vindictive.

1:02:12.917 --> 1:02:14.375
Robbie should have known that
from the beginning.

1:02:14.417 --> 1:02:16.000
He's really only got
himself to blame.

1:02:16.042 --> 1:02:17.750
That's really unfair.

1:02:17.792 --> 1:02:19.208
His loyalty to Wilde
was exemplary.

1:02:19.250 --> 1:02:22.792
All right, all right.
Robbie's a saint.

1:02:22.833 --> 1:02:24.917
Now, how about
we drop the subject?

1:02:30.625 --> 1:02:32.125
Oh, that's a very fine sword.

1:02:33.125 --> 1:02:34.542
It was my brother's.

1:02:34.583 --> 1:02:35.625
Hmm.

What is it?

1:02:47.875 --> 1:02:50.000
It's the first performance
of Façade,

1:02:50.042 --> 1:02:52.083
and I was supposed
to go to it.

1:02:52.125 --> 1:02:54.458
Well, where's it
being performed?

1:02:54.500 --> 1:02:57.667
Some private performance
in Carlyle Square.

1:02:58.042 --> 1:02:59.583
Chelsea.

1:02:59.625 --> 1:03:00.958
Well, even if we drove
like the wind,

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.167
we should never make it.

1:03:02.208 --> 1:03:04.083
Robbie will be furious.

1:03:04.125 --> 1:03:05.708
And so will Edith Sitwell.

1:03:07.208 --> 1:03:09.917
It's being given
to a very select audience.

1:03:09.958 --> 1:03:11.708
I'm sure she'll understand
once you explain

1:03:11.750 --> 1:03:13.292
why you weren't able
to be there.

1:03:13.333 --> 1:03:15.292
Oh, no,
I don't think so, Mother.

1:03:15.333 --> 1:03:17.167
Edith can be a very
captious woman.

1:03:17.208 --> 1:03:18.542
She isn't a woman.

1:03:18.583 --> 1:03:20.208
She's an animated meringue.

1:03:21.042 --> 1:03:22.292
And those teeth.

1:03:22.333 --> 1:03:24.833
Don't be horrible, Ivor.

1:03:24.875 --> 1:03:26.417
She suffers, I believe,
from a complaint

1:03:26.458 --> 1:03:28.042
known as receding gums.

1:03:28.083 --> 1:03:29.250
She's so autocratic,

1:03:29.292 --> 1:03:31.125
I'm surprised she gave
them permission to.

Oh, well, come along then.

1:03:35.125 --> 1:03:37.792
Might as well see
if we can catch some of it.

1:03:37.833 --> 1:03:39.833
I'm sorry to have to rush off
like this, Mother.

1:03:39.875 --> 1:03:41.000
It doesn't matter.

1:03:45.333 --> 1:03:48.333
Is he just another one
of your pretty boys?

1:03:49.625 --> 1:03:53.042
No, it's deeper than that,
much deeper.

1:03:55.833 --> 1:03:58.083
You don't like him,
do you, Mother?

1:03:58.125 --> 1:04:00.792
He's amusing, but unpleasant.

1:04:02.042 --> 1:04:05.542
It's his eyes.
I think they're cruel.

1:04:12.958 --> 1:04:14.167

Please forgive me, Edith.

1:04:27.583 --> 1:04:28.917
I shall try.

1:04:29.792 --> 1:04:31.083
I'm entirely to blame.

1:04:31.125 --> 1:04:33.208
We visited my mother
in Kent and I simply

1:04:33.250 --> 1:04:34.500
lost all sense of time.

1:04:36.167 --> 1:04:37.917
-We?
-SIEGFRIED: Mmm.

1:04:39.583 --> 1:04:41.417

of poetry.

I do hope you can
forgive me, Edith,

1:04:49.708 --> 1:04:52.292
for I am mortified
by my thoughtlessness.

1:04:53.167 --> 1:04:54.875
How was the work received?

1:04:55.625 --> 1:04:56.625
They tittered.

1:04:57.875 --> 1:04:58.958

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:00.042
Tittered.

1:05:01.583 --> 1:05:05.958
I overheard someone say,
in the most odious manner,

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:07.208
"It's this sort of thing

1:05:07.250 --> 1:05:09.375
"that makes one glad
to be semi-conscious."

-I was deeply wounded.
-SIEGFRIED: Hmm.

1:05:14.542 --> 1:05:18.458
My poetry has wonderful
assonances and dissonances.

1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:20.542
I use words for their colour,

1:05:20.583 --> 1:05:24.333
not merely for what
they are supposed to mean.

1:05:24.375 --> 1:05:27.208
Great art may sometimes be
so ahead of its time, Edith,

1:05:27.250 --> 1:05:28.583
that its initial reception

1:05:28.625 --> 1:05:31.250
can be considered
a succès d'estime.

1:05:32.583 --> 1:05:33.708
Think of Stravinsky.

1:05:35.167 --> 1:05:37.667
But I do not wish
to think of Stravinsky.

1:05:42.875 --> 1:05:46.542
We are performing Façade
at the Aeolian Hall next week.

1:05:46.583 --> 1:05:48.167

1:05:48.208 --> 1:05:49.583
Of course, Edith.

1:05:49.625 --> 1:05:52.792
I shall come with the speed
of a thousand gazelles.

For Hell is just
as properly proper,

1:06:33.833 --> 1:06:37.917
as Greenwich, or as Bath,
or Joppa!

to my country.

1:16:48.125 --> 1:16:51.375
I boosted morale by playing
every theatre in the land!

1:16:51.417 --> 1:16:52.875
Oh, weren't you the lucky one!

1:16:52.917 --> 1:16:55.750
We had the Somme
and you had Rhyl!

1:17:03.250 --> 1:17:06.333
Well, I see no point
in prolonging

1:17:06.375 --> 1:17:07.917
this unpleasant conversation.

1:17:07.958 --> 1:17:10.625
-No.
-(SNAPS FINGERS)

1:17:10.667 --> 1:17:11.833
Oh, no.
After what's been said,

1:17:11.875 --> 1:17:13.333
I don't expect you
to foot the bill as well.

1:17:13.375 --> 1:17:16.125
Oh, always the gentleman,
eh, Siegfried?

1:17:16.167 --> 1:17:17.708
It's better than being a cad.

1:17:19.667 --> 1:17:21.542
I suspect this is
goodbye then.

1:17:21.583 --> 1:17:23.292
Au revoir
might have been kinder.

1:17:23.333 --> 1:17:25.708
Please don't undermine
yourself, Siegfried.

1:17:25.750 --> 1:17:27.333
That's what friends are for.

1:17:27.375 --> 1:17:29.875
If you wish to see me again,
I'll be at my flat.

1:17:29.917 --> 1:17:31.042
(SCOFFS)

1:17:31.083 --> 1:17:32.125
Well, at least
that's more original

1:17:32.167 --> 1:17:33.583
than going home to mother.

Yes, of course.

1:18:00.333 --> 1:18:01.750
Do you still dine here?

1:18:02.625 --> 1:18:04.583
-Of course.
-Why?

1:18:06.792 --> 1:18:10.292
Let's just say I like
the trips down memory lane.

1:18:10.750 --> 1:18:11.958
(LAUGHS)

1:18:18.250 --> 1:18:19.417
What next?

1:18:23.417 --> 1:18:27.750
Well, I suppose, in a bad
melodrama, I'd kill myself.

1:18:27.792 --> 1:18:30.375
And in a really bad melodrama,
you kill Ivor.

The moment passes,
but the hurt remains.

1:18:46.417 --> 1:18:47.917
And I was supposed to go
and visit my mother

1:18:47.958 --> 1:18:49.375
and now I've missed the train.

1:18:49.417 --> 1:18:51.083
Drive down, why don't you?

1:18:51.125 --> 1:18:52.625
I have no car. I can't drive.

1:18:55.333 --> 1:18:57.667
I was going to motor
down to the coast.

1:18:58.792 --> 1:19:00.458
Why don't I give you a lift?

1:19:02.542 --> 1:19:03.875

very kind of you.

1:19:06.167 --> 1:19:07.417

Then let's get going.

1:19:24.958 --> 1:19:27.917

no idea where we are.

1:19:54.458 --> 1:19:55.458
Oh.

1:19:57.417 --> 1:19:59.167
Pity Margate is so far away.

1:20:01.917 --> 1:20:03.125
It's not at the moment.

smouldering through spouts
of drifting smoke

1:20:34.792 --> 1:20:37.333
that shroud the menacing
scarred slope.

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:39.750
And, one by one,

forward to the wire.

1:20:51.125 --> 1:20:55.917

Siegfried, Bobby.

1:21:50.167 --> 1:21:52.000
Well, don't look so shocked.

1:21:52.042 --> 1:21:53.917
Love has nothing
to do with monogamy.

Or are you the faithful type?

1:21:58.208 --> 1:21:59.292
I suppose I must be.

If you want fidelity,

You kept very quiet
about this.

1:22:07.750 --> 1:22:09.042
Well, that's because
I didn't want anyone else

wasn't pure,

I could go through it.

1:30:41.833 --> 1:30:43.625
You're more opaque, I think.

1:30:46.708 --> 1:30:48.208
So what brings you down here?

1:30:49.292 --> 1:30:53.250
I... I should like to say
the picturesque,

1:30:53.958 --> 1:30:55.167
but it wouldn't be true.

1:30:58.375 --> 1:31:00.583
I came down in the hope
of seeing you again.

1:31:01.875 --> 1:31:03.500
I used the painting as a ploy.

1:31:05.500 --> 1:31:06.500
Oh.

1:31:07.458 --> 1:31:08.625
Well, I'm touched.

1:31:11.042 --> 1:31:14.292
No one's ever used subterfuge
before in order to see me.

1:31:14.333 --> 1:31:17.833
It's the modern thing,
liberated woman and all that.

1:31:26.958 --> 1:31:29.292
It would be very pleasant
if you invited me to lunch.

1:31:32.583 --> 1:31:34.708
It would be very pleasant
if you accepted.

all I needed to know.

1:33:17.292 --> 1:33:18.500
All my life, I feel as though

1:33:18.542 --> 1:33:21.625
I've been waiting
for a catastrophe to happen.

You must redeem
my life for me, Hester.

1:33:36.125 --> 1:33:38.333
That sounds like
some sort of proposal.

Oh, I look 500 years old.

1:34:12.458 --> 1:34:14.417
Some say I am beautiful.

1:34:15.833 --> 1:34:17.208
And, as an aesthete,

1:34:18.333 --> 1:34:20.708
I feel that beauty is eternal.

1:34:23.917 --> 1:34:28.333
We see it in the eyes
of those who love us.

1:34:32.125 --> 1:34:34.958
Although my mother thinks

1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.917
that my eyes
are like cold seawater.

1:34:42.958 --> 1:34:47.458
My buttocks and my shoulders
are very well-shaped.

1:34:48.833 --> 1:34:54.792
But my best feature
is the beauty of my hands.

1:34:54.833 --> 1:34:58.458
Almond milk and lemon creams
are perfect for them,

1:34:59.750 --> 1:35:02.958
and one must never
laugh too much.

1:35:04.042 --> 1:35:06.167
It coarsens one's face,

1:35:06.208 --> 1:35:09.083
especially if the laughter
is gleeful.

1:35:09.125 --> 1:35:12.333
Stephen, how can you
be so narcissistic?

1:35:12.375 --> 1:35:15.417
It is my defence against
nihilism and the vulgar.

1:35:15.458 --> 1:35:17.417
You cannot conduct a life
in that way.

1:35:17.458 --> 1:35:18.500
Course one can.

1:35:19.250 --> 1:35:20.958
My life is my art.

1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.083
Yours isn't a life,
it's barely a hobby.

1:35:23.125 --> 1:35:24.792
That was an ugly thing to say.

1:35:24.833 --> 1:35:27.417
I know sometimes it's better
to be kind than honest,

1:35:27.458 --> 1:35:29.583
but you are frittering
your life away

1:35:29.625 --> 1:35:31.375
in pomades and powder.

1:35:33.083 --> 1:35:34.250
And if you don't believe me,

and less love.

1:35:36.167 --> 1:35:38.792
You've made your antipathy
to me very obvious.

1:35:38.833 --> 1:35:40.667
I don't need a second opinion.

1:35:42.208 --> 1:35:44.042
I'm going to Salisbury
for the weekend.

1:35:46.125 --> 1:35:47.250
Edith Oliver has found me

1:35:47.292 --> 1:35:48.958
a cottage to rent
in Teffont Magna.

1:35:51.042 --> 1:35:53.042
I thought we could
spend weekends there.

Will you come?

I, too, have had
an invitation.

1:36:00.250 --> 1:36:01.542
From whom?

1:36:01.583 --> 1:36:05.042
A German prince whom
I think you more than know.

1:36:07.375 --> 1:36:09.292
Philip of Hesse, yes.

1:36:09.333 --> 1:36:11.125

And where are you going to?

1:36:23.958 --> 1:36:26.333
Paris first.

1:36:26.375 --> 1:36:29.333
Then we'll motor down to
Bavaria so I can recuperate

1:36:29.375 --> 1:36:30.375
from life.

1:36:32.750 --> 1:36:34.833
After Bavaria, they're going
to go on to Venice.

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.042
Philip told me that he once

1:36:37.083 --> 1:36:38.500
tried to make love
in a gondola,

1:36:38.542 --> 1:36:39.875
but that there wasn't
enough privacy.

1:36:39.917 --> 1:36:41.417
Stability.

1:36:43.458 --> 1:36:45.375

You sly old thing.

I'll make some tea.

1:38:30.625 --> 1:38:33.167
I suppose you've heard

1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:35.500
Yes.

1:38:38.708 --> 1:38:42.375
They say the funeral attracted
a thousand people.

1:38:44.625 --> 1:38:47.458
Probably made up mostly by
all the people he slept with.

1:38:54.333 --> 1:38:56.958
I still have a soft spot
for Ivor's work, though.

1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.625
All those tortured
princesses and lovers

1:39:00.667 --> 1:39:03.542
who have no money,
but plenty of sex appeal.

1:39:03.583 --> 1:39:06.208
His work was always
sentimental nonsense.

1:39:07.708 --> 1:39:09.708
He cheapened everything
he touched.

1:39:09.750 --> 1:39:12.500
I've always thought his
particular kind of mawkishness

1:39:12.542 --> 1:39:14.042
was a kind of catharsis

1:39:14.083 --> 1:39:18.250
for the dimmer members
among us.

1:39:18.292 --> 1:39:19.458
That's because
you have never known

1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:20.708
the difference
between the two.

1:39:20.750 --> 1:39:22.750
We can't all possess
your purity of thought.

1:39:22.792 --> 1:39:25.542
It isn't a question of purity,

1:39:25.583 --> 1:39:27.917
but of discernment.

1:39:27.958 --> 1:39:31.833
And you were never very good
at discernment.

1:39:34.375 --> 1:39:37.083
That was rather too acerbic.

1:39:37.125 --> 1:39:40.250
Mordant would be
the more accurate word.

1:39:46.750 --> 1:39:48.667
Are you still very angry?

1:39:49.708 --> 1:39:50.708
What do you expect?

1:39:51.875 --> 1:39:52.917
You ended our relationship

1:39:52.958 --> 1:39:54.583
with a letter
from your doctor.

1:39:56.375 --> 1:39:58.250
How was I supposed to feel?

1:39:58.292 --> 1:40:00.667
Still clearly very hurt,
I see.

I had hoped that
you might have been

1:40:03.250 --> 1:40:04.583
a little more forgiving.

If I had treated you the way
in which you treated me,

1:40:08.458 --> 1:40:10.333
how forgiving would you be?

Besides,
when the parade's gone by,

1:40:14.375 --> 1:40:15.750
you have to have
enough sense to realize

1:40:15.792 --> 1:40:17.458
that you are no longer
a part of it.

He has the worst aspects

OLDER STEPHEN: How about
his parents' virtues?

1:41:13.250 --> 1:41:15.125
He's cursed
with those as well.

1:41:29.083 --> 1:41:30.708
One does hope so.

1:41:32.708 --> 1:41:34.208
George has an
independent mind,

1:41:34.250 --> 1:41:36.875
which sometimes
shocks Siegfried.

1:41:36.917 --> 1:41:38.542
It isn't independence,
it's wilfulness.

1:41:45.458 --> 1:41:46.917
Who's died?

All of us.

George, the pipe
was not a good idea.

as there always was.

it's more humane

2:00:47.750 --> 2:00:50.333
Well, you've got to bathe
and change.

2:00:51.750 --> 2:00:53.417
We're going to the theatre,
remember?

2:00:54.292 --> 2:00:55.333
Do I have to?

2:00:55.375 --> 2:00:57.292
Yes, you promised.

2:00:58.542 --> 2:01:01.083
Besides, it's a witty
and elegant score.

2:01:02.292 --> 2:01:04.250
Even you might enjoy it.

2:01:09.958 --> 2:01:11.083
I'm sorry I shouted.

2:01:12.833 --> 2:01:14.792
It's... So am I.

2:01:20.583 --> 2:01:21.875
Peace?

2:01:24.750 --> 2:01:26.125
Peace.

WOMAN: (SINGING)
My mother said I never should

2:01:36.208 --> 2:01:39.125
Play with the young man
in the wood

2:01:39.167 --> 2:01:41.708
If I did, she would say

2:01:41.750 --> 2:01:45.417
"Naughty little girl
to disobey"

2:01:48.833 --> 2:01:51.083
I'm a typically English rose

2:01:51.125 --> 2:01:54.083
But born of typically
English stock

2:01:54.125 --> 2:01:59.292
With a typically Anglo-Saxon
family tree

2:01:59.333 --> 2:02:04.583
I received my education
from a typically English way

2:02:04.625 --> 2:02:09.167
In a typically
English girl's academy

2:02:12.333 --> 2:02:15.000
I play typically
English tennis

2:02:15.042 --> 2:02:17.500
At a typically English club

2:02:17.542 --> 2:02:22.708
With my typically
English feelings for fair play

2:02:22.750 --> 2:02:25.583
I eat typically
English crumpets

2:02:25.625 --> 2:02:26.667

2:02:27.792 --> 2:02:29.500
With my typically English tea

2:02:29.542 --> 2:02:34.958
At the end
of every typically English day

2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:40.250
Father is a typically
English colonel

2:02:40.292 --> 2:02:44.042
Home is a typically
English county town

2:02:45.583 --> 2:02:49.458
Mummy and I play
typically English patients

2:02:49.500 --> 2:02:54.250
As the typically English rain
is pouring down

With a typically
English spaniel

2:02:57.958 --> 2:03:00.542
Who likes typically
English walks

2:03:00.583 --> 2:03:03.042
Cause there's typically
English trees

2:03:03.083 --> 2:03:04.583
Upon the heath

2:03:06.042 --> 2:03:08.167
And if anyone asked me

2:03:08.208 --> 2:03:11.042
How I like
this typically English life

2:03:11.083 --> 2:03:15.875
I am fed up
to my typically English tea

-(APPLAUSE)

2:03:35.875 --> 2:03:37.500
Shall we take a cab?

2:03:42.917 --> 2:03:43.917
No, I'll walk home.

2:03:48.167 --> 2:03:49.917
Are you sure?

2:03:49.958 --> 2:03:52.792
It's getting very chilly.

2:03:59.417 --> 2:04:00.417
I'd rather walk.

2:05:17.333 --> 2:05:19.333
WILFRED: Perhaps my latest
effort will please you.

2:05:20.333 --> 2:05:21.875
It's called Disabled.

2:05:28.833 --> 2:05:29.917
I'll come and get you.

2:05:29.958 --> 2:05:30.958
Thank you.

2:05:33.708 --> 2:05:35.833
SIEGFRIED: He sat
in a wheeled chair,

2:05:35.875 --> 2:05:37.958
waiting for dark

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:41.917
and shivered in his ghastly
suit of grey, legless,

2:05:42.750 --> 2:05:44.500
sewn short at elbow.

2:05:46.042 --> 2:05:47.250
Through the park,

2:05:47.292 --> 2:05:50.542
voices of boys rang
saddening like a hymn.

2:05:50.583 --> 2:05:53.792
Voices of play and pleasure
after day.

2:05:53.833 --> 2:05:56.458
Till gathering sleep
had mothered them from him.

2:05:57.708 --> 2:05:58.958
About this time,

2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:00.833
town used to swing so gay

2:06:00.875 --> 2:06:03.833
when glow-lamps budded
in the light blue trees,

2:06:03.875 --> 2:06:06.083
and girls glanced lovelier

2:06:06.125 --> 2:06:10.417
as the air grew dim
in the old times,

2:06:11.792 --> 2:06:13.875
before we threw away
his knees.

2:06:15.708 --> 2:06:20.000
Now he will never feel again
how slim girls' waists are

2:06:20.042 --> 2:06:23.000
or how warm
their subtle hands.

2:06:23.042 --> 2:06:26.542
All of them touch him
like some queer disease.

2:06:28.625 --> 2:06:30.708
There was an artist
silly for his face,

2:06:32.042 --> 2:06:34.500
for it was younger
than his youth, last year.

2:06:36.333 --> 2:06:41.500
Now he is old,
his back will never brace.

2:06:41.542 --> 2:06:44.750
He's lost his colour
very far from here.

2:06:44.792 --> 2:06:47.542
Poured it down shell-holes
till the veins ran dry,

2:06:47.583 --> 2:06:50.667
and half his lifetime lapsed
in the hot race.

2:06:50.708 --> 2:06:53.250
And leap of purple
spurted from his thigh.

2:06:54.958 --> 2:06:57.833
One time he liked
a blood-smear down his leg,

2:06:57.875 --> 2:07:00.458
after the matches
carried shoulder-high.

2:07:01.833 --> 2:07:04.542
It was after football
when he'd drunk a peg,

2:07:04.583 --> 2:07:06.500
he thought he'd better join.

2:07:06.542 --> 2:07:07.958
He wonders why.

2:07:09.250 --> 2:07:11.542
Someone had said
he'd looked a god in kilts.

2:07:12.708 --> 2:07:14.167
That's why.

2:07:14.208 --> 2:07:16.583
And maybe, too,
to please his Meg.

2:07:16.625 --> 2:07:18.625
Aye, that was it,

2:07:18.667 --> 2:07:21.833
to please the giddy jilts,
he'd asked to join.

2:07:21.875 --> 2:07:23.750
He didn't have to beg.

2:07:23.792 --> 2:07:25.292
Smiling they wrote his lie:

2:07:26.125 --> 2:07:28.125
aged 19 years.

2:07:29.667 --> 2:07:33.167
Germans he scarcely
thought of, all their guilt,

2:07:33.208 --> 2:07:35.458
and Austria's,
did not move him.

2:07:36.833 --> 2:07:39.292
And no fears of fear came yet.

2:07:41.333 --> 2:07:42.750
He thought of jewelled hilts

2:07:42.792 --> 2:07:47.250
for daggers in plaid socks,
of smart salutes,

2:07:47.292 --> 2:07:52.417
and care of arms, and leave,
and pay arrears,

2:07:52.458 --> 2:07:55.750
esprit de corps,
and hints for young recruits.

2:07:57.750 --> 2:08:00.750
And soon, he was drafted out
with drums and cheers.

2:08:02.750 --> 2:08:08.417
Some cheered him home,
but not as crowds cheer goal.

2:08:08.458 --> 2:08:12.542
Only a solemn man who brought
him fruits thanked him.

2:08:12.583 --> 2:08:15.167
And then inquired
about his soul.

2:08:17.833 --> 2:08:21.667
Now he will spend a few
sick years in institutes

2:08:21.708 --> 2:08:24.833
and do what things
the rules consider wise,

2:08:24.875 --> 2:08:27.292
and take whatever pity
they may dole.

2:08:28.875 --> 2:08:30.542
Tonight he noticed
how women's eyes

2:08:30.583 --> 2:08:33.583
passed from him to the
strong men who were whole.

2:08:36.292 --> 2:08:38.458
How cold and late it is.

2:08:40.042 --> 2:08:42.292
Why don't they come
and put him into bed?

2:08:44.750 --> 2:08:46.375
Why don't they come?

2:08:52.167 --> 2:08:54.792
