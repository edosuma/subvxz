He could be an accessory in this,
and I think we both know

he's the reason Gavin's missing.
And he's a flight risk.

With the legal he's gonna have,
we need to be ironclad.

because what I do know

07:12.390 --> 07:14.600
is that he's going to talk to his son.

11:40.491 --> 11:43.661
Oh! I mean… [chuckles]
I mean, yeah, of course.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.746
I've thought about you
like every day for a year,

11:45.830 --> 11:47.998
so yeah,
I've definitely thought about it.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.334
I mean, it was perfect, right?

11:50.418 --> 11:55.297
Like, the moonlight
and the beach and the bonfire…

11:55.381 --> 11:56.632
Yeah, it was a great night.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.010
Like, there's nothing
that could've made that more perfect.

12:00.094 --> 12:04.181
Right? And the whole night leading up
to that was just so much fun, you know?

12:04.265 --> 12:06.267
-The beach, the stars…
-Yeah. The setting was--

12:06.350 --> 12:08.060
-It was nice.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.649
So it should've been like… wow.

12:14.817 --> 12:20.656
But instead, it was,
like, kind of… kind of weird, right?

12:21.407 --> 12:23.534
What do you mean by weird? Like weird how?

12:24.076 --> 12:27.580
Um, after, you know, we did it,

12:28.956 --> 12:31.959
I didn't really know what to say.

12:33.085 --> 12:33.919
Okay.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.006
You know,
we've been best friends for so long,

12:37.089 --> 12:39.800
and so much has happened.
I mean, like, John B and Sarah "died."

12:39.884 --> 12:43.888
And my mom's threatening me
with boarding school.

12:43.971 --> 12:47.808
And I really can't stand the idea
of not being able to talk to you.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.936
No, right, I understand. You know,
like, we gotta keep the friendship.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.271
Yeah.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.565
Absolutely.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.401
Like, the last few days,
I just, like, wanted things

12:57.485 --> 12:59.945
to go back to the way that they were.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.574
I mean, didn't you?
Things used to be so good.

13:03.657 --> 13:04.492
[mouths]

13:06.827 --> 13:07.703
Yeah.

13:08.913 --> 13:12.416
And I… I really don't want to say it,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.336
but, you know, maybe we should just…

13:15.419 --> 13:17.505
-Maybe we should, you know, be--
-Friends?

13:18.005 --> 13:20.966
Yes, friends. I was--
That's what I was gonna say.

13:21.884 --> 13:22.718
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.762
Yeah, we can be friends.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.765
Yeah, um…

13:29.809 --> 13:31.393
So we're good. Yeah.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.311
Yeah.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.564
I feel so much better.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.859
If we weren't Pogues,
we would be fighting right now.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.278
Well, it's a good thing we're Pogues.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.448
Pope! Pope! [panting]

13:44.532 --> 13:47.535
Just got a call from Guffy.
Something happened to your pops.

13:48.828 --> 13:49.829
What?

13:50.788 --> 13:53.457
[Kie] John B! Sarah! Come on!

13:54.166 --> 13:57.878
-[Sarah] Let me know if I'm hurting you.
-[Heyward] You're doing fine. [groans]

13:57.962 --> 13:59.630
-[Sarah] Okay.
-[winces] Thank you, darlin'.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.257
-Pop, what happened?
-Thank you.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.175
Oh, I should've known better.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.594
He came in just as I was about to lock up.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.304
Caught me by surprise.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.307
Once he had me down,
he put his knee in my chest,

14:10.391 --> 14:14.395
and he asked me about that… that… that key
from that… that drawing you showed me.

14:14.478 --> 14:17.523
And in case you're wondering,
I ain't tell him nothing.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.067
Now did you track it down?

14:27.032 --> 14:30.661
I found it in Mee-maw's old apartment
above the pharmacy just like you said.

14:30.744 --> 14:34.373
Shit, boy, you should've gave this to me.
I wouldn't have had to take a beating.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.960
What's the big deal? It ain't worth
anything. Why they want it so bad?

14:38.043 --> 14:40.004
I don't know.
First, I get this letter telling me

14:40.087 --> 14:41.589
that I need to go to Charleston.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.091
And then I meet a rich lady
who wants me to give her a key

14:44.174 --> 14:46.051
that I didn't even know was in my family.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.178
None of it makes any sense.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.348
Well, don't y'all just sit here
whining about it.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.350
Figure it out!

14:53.434 --> 14:56.979
No. I'm just gonna give the key
to that lady. It's not worth--

14:57.062 --> 14:59.773
No, no, no. Did I raise you
to back down from a fight, boy?

15:01.442 --> 15:02.276
No, sir.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.361
Well, all right.

15:05.154 --> 15:09.408
Now, I… I didn't think about it before.
I admit that. But now…

15:11.118 --> 15:12.161
Now?

15:12.995 --> 15:14.079
I'm interested.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.124
Well, did they say why they wanted it?

15:17.207 --> 15:19.793
Something about an old cross.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.963
I think it might be
some kind of lost treasure.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.257
You know who you should talk to?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.302
Your great-grandmother, Mee-maw.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.687
The Heyward guy wouldn't tell me
where the kid was…

15:41.315 --> 15:42.858
but I think he's got the key.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.110
You're pathetic. [scoffs]

15:45.653 --> 15:46.570
You think?

15:46.654 --> 15:50.616
No wonder Daddy didn't want anything
to do with you, didn't give you his name.

15:50.699 --> 15:54.286
After you slithered out of that tramp,
abandoned us for years…

15:56.705 --> 16:00.000
only to come crawling back,
looking for a payout.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.754
I was kind enough
to take you in… [scoffs]

16:03.837 --> 16:07.466
…and all you do is spite me.

16:07.549 --> 16:08.759
Enough, all right?

16:08.842 --> 16:11.845
-[grunts, groans]
-Easy, easy.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.974
-Oh.
-[grunting]

16:15.808 --> 16:17.393
[both sighing]

16:18.894 --> 16:20.896
I'm gonna die, Renfield.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.148
Die.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.235
And soon.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.656
Do you know what that feels like?

16:31.365 --> 16:32.199
[sighs]

16:33.701 --> 16:34.618
I'm sorry.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.246
We'll get the key.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.748
I don't have time for any more accidents.

16:42.751 --> 16:47.506
And stop making excuses, please.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.466
It's so weak.

16:50.134 --> 16:53.178
No key, no estate.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.065
Where are you going, ma'am?

17:05.149 --> 17:08.068
Why do I have to tell you?
This is America last time I checked.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.361
Where's Mr. Cameron?

17:09.445 --> 17:11.864
He's at the house cleaning up
the mess you and your men left.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.075
May I go?

17:16.410 --> 17:17.411
God.

17:23.959 --> 17:24.877
Keep eyes on her.

["Johnny Says Stay Cool"
by The Babe Rainbow playing]

18:23.352 --> 18:26.688
[Pope] Guys, the thing that Limbrey said,
I don't think she meant to let it slip.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.691
She said the key leads
to the Cross of Santo Domingo.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.901
[JJ] Wait. Can I see that?

18:31.401 --> 18:33.028
Are we supposed to know what that is?

18:33.112 --> 18:36.782
I'm guessing it's some sort of
historical artifact of great importance.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.368
Well, according to the interwebs,
it was a gift

18:39.451 --> 18:41.537
from New Spain to the Spanish king.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.622
New Spain? Is there an Old Spain?

18:43.705 --> 18:46.250
Shit, talk about over-gifting.
Look at that thing.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.710
Looks like a person standing next to it.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.003
[JJ] So it's a giant-ass cross.

18:50.087 --> 18:54.299
It was widely considered at the time
to be the most extravagant tribute ever

18:54.383 --> 18:55.676
from the provinces.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.388
It was lost
off the coast of Bermuda in 1829.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.598
-Did you just say Bermuda?
-Oh, no. Not the triangle.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.600
It always leads back
to the triangle, dude.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.228
Like every single time something's weird,
it's Bermuda.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.273
What does a key found
above your mee-maw's pharmacy have to do

19:09.356 --> 19:10.691
with any of this?

19:10.774 --> 19:12.943
-Yeah.
-Where do we come in?

19:14.319 --> 19:17.739
I don't know. That's a good question.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.418
Hey, actually, I think
I'm gonna do this one by myself.

19:30.711 --> 19:31.670
Are you sure?

19:31.753 --> 19:34.882
Yeah, I can handle it.
I don't really need you, so…

No, Mee-maw,

I don't know how I'm supposed to know that
was you standing so far away like that.

Hello, Bobby.

20:30.896 --> 20:34.274
Uh, it's… it's Pope, your great-grandson.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.235
Hey, um,

20:36.818 --> 20:39.655
do you mind if I talk to you
about something in private?

20:43.200 --> 20:44.743
Thank you, baby.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.455
-Mee-maw?
-Hmm?

20:48.538 --> 20:50.165
-Can I show you something?
-Sure.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.502
[Pope] Do you recognize this?

20:54.378 --> 20:56.505
Now, I'm supposed to see
that little thing?

20:57.172 --> 20:58.340
Hold it closer.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.721
-Now, what's this to?
-It used to belong to you.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.057
There's an inscription on it.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.435
It says, "The path to the tomb
begins in the island room."

21:11.103 --> 21:14.189
-"The path to the tomb"?
-"Begins in the island room."

21:16.858 --> 21:18.694
Do you know what the island room is

21:19.695 --> 21:21.697
or why our family has this key?

21:25.075 --> 21:26.034

Mee-maw, please, you have to remember.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.796
Do you know whose key this is?

21:39.715 --> 21:41.258
Is this Denmark Tanny's key?

21:41.341 --> 21:42.926
How did we get it?

21:45.429 --> 21:47.347
Are we related to Denmark Tanny?

21:47.431 --> 21:49.308
Please, tell me.

21:51.018 --> 21:51.935
And his wife.

21:53.895 --> 21:54.771

21:59.860 --> 22:02.154

22:11.747 --> 22:13.332
[John B] Yeah, like seven days ago.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.791
I mean, dude, think about it.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.918
Ward's still out there,
and he's got the gold.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.253
I know. I know.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.048
-He killed my Dad.
-John B, I know, and we won't let that go.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.885
But I'm worried about you, man.
It feels like it's either you or him.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.637
And you know who else
I'm worried about? Sarah.

22:28.638 --> 22:32.059
I mean, bro, like, it's her dad.
You see what I'm saying?

22:34.895 --> 22:36.188
She knows what he did.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.150
[John B] So what's the deal
with this Limbrey chick?

22:40.233 --> 22:43.320
Pope said she has evidence on tape
that could put Ward away, right?

22:43.403 --> 22:47.032
Mm-hmm. On the other hand, though,
she did just try to kidnap Pope, and--

22:47.115 --> 22:50.369
But think about it, all right?
If we can get that evidence, it's done.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.997
We could put Ward away for good
and finally get justice for my dad.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.375
This can all be over in one shot, J.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.043
I get it. It's dangerous.

-[JJ] 'Cause I got a plan.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.382
Hopefully it's better
than springing me out of jail.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.217
Nah, this is my best yet. Listen.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.928
Of course I thanked Topper.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.597
He saved my life,
and I'd put him through so much already.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.600
And you'd think that
that is the crime of the century.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.561
Tell me about it.
All of this crazy shit's happening,

23:16.645 --> 23:21.983
and Pope's giving me the silent treatment
for not being in love with him.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.777
And we're the dramatic ones.

23:23.860 --> 23:24.820
-Sure.
-[laughs]

23:26.738 --> 23:29.241
Why did you keep this a secret from us?

23:30.117 --> 23:33.578
Denmark Tanny is in our family.
That's a good thing.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.580
Do you know what happened?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.624
They hung him!

23:39.167 --> 23:42.504
[crying] I didn't want nobody going out
there avenging in his name.

23:43.296 --> 23:47.926
I didn't want what happened to Denmark
to happen to you or your daddy.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.263
[sniffles, crying] But we should've known.

23:52.013 --> 23:55.475
I was protecting you, baby.
It was better you didn't know.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.393
[sniffles]

23:57.936 --> 24:00.689
And I don't want you
to do nothing crazy now.

24:01.731 --> 24:03.567
No crazier than anything I normally do.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.111
[laughs] Oh, I love you, Pope.

24:06.778 --> 24:07.612
Oh.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.783
Oh. Family's all we got.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.123
[JJ] There he is.

24:18.832 --> 24:19.833
[door slides open]

24:21.710 --> 24:22.586
[Pope sighs]

24:24.379 --> 24:25.755
[door slides shut]

24:26.590 --> 24:27.924
[exhales deeply]

24:28.008 --> 24:30.010
So, how'd it go?

24:31.094 --> 24:33.305
Shit just got way more personal.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.515
["Pork Rind" by Blackfoot Gypsies playing]

24:37.684 --> 24:39.186
[engine revs]

24:45.650 --> 24:47.110
[suspenseful music playing]

24:52.824 --> 24:56.119
Wait here. You'll get
another one of these when I come back.

25:00.290 --> 25:03.001
-[Ward] Rafe. We need to talk.
-[knocks on door]

25:03.710 --> 25:05.086
They got me, right?

25:05.170 --> 25:07.631
-We heard it on the news. I'm… I'm done.
-Not yet.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.090
-[Rafe] Not yet?
-No.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.593
Yeah, listen to your daddy, Rafe.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.970
Ain't shit over till it's over,
ain't that right?

25:14.054 --> 25:15.472
Can we have a moment, please?

25:15.555 --> 25:17.766
Of course, bro! Yeah! What was I thinking?

25:17.849 --> 25:21.686
Shit, it's my house.
Y'all take as many minutes as y'all need.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.116
What happened here? Hmm?

25:36.409 --> 25:38.578
Rafe, I need you to listen to me

25:38.662 --> 25:40.830
if you've ever listened
to me before, okay?

25:40.914 --> 25:41.790
-Rafe.
-Yeah.

25:41.873 --> 25:45.043
Rafe, look, I want you to take this.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.132
Take this, all right?
Go to Wilmington tonight.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.636
I need a boat to get to Wilmington.
I don't have a boat.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.638
[Ward] You can find a boat.
You can figure it out.

25:56.721 --> 26:01.560
And you gotta stay hidden too.
So just… get to Wilmington, all right?

26:02.143 --> 26:04.729
[sighs] I want you to go to my old office.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.273
-Remember?
-Yeah.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.607
-Market Street? Yeah?
-Yeah.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.360
-Right out back, there's a car.
-Okay.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.279
Want you to drive it straight to Raleigh.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.864
-I want you to go to McClintock Aviation.
-Got it.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.157
I'll charter you a plane.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.285
-You're gonna get out of here.
-Charter me where?

26:18.368 --> 26:21.580
I don't know, Son. I mean, it's gonna be
somewhere safe. I'll figure that out.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.039
-Dad.
-The important thing is--

26:23.123 --> 26:24.749
-Dad.
-What?

26:30.714 --> 26:31.756
I'm sorry.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.470
-You don't have to be sorry, Son.
-No, no, no.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.889
-You were right about a lot of things.
-No.

26:41.516 --> 26:42.559
A lot of things.

26:46.146 --> 26:51.234
I was gonna be better, you know?
I was… I was planning on getting clean.

26:51.860 --> 26:52.694
I know.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.114
No, but I… I…
but I know you don't believe me.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.074
-I do.
-No, it's fine.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.701
Hey, hey. Look at me.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.746
I believe you.

27:04.539 --> 27:07.250
You're gonna have all the time
in the world to show me too, all right?

27:08.877 --> 27:12.547
'Cause you're not going to jail
for something you did for me.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.299
[sniffles]

27:15.508 --> 27:16.926
-Okay?
-Yeah.

27:17.927 --> 27:18.762
I guarantee it.

27:26.019 --> 27:26.978
You be safe.

27:33.026 --> 27:36.279
[exhales] You know how
you're always asking me who I'd choose,

27:36.363 --> 27:38.865
if I'd choose you
or if I'd choose Sarah? All that?

27:38.948 --> 27:42.369
No, that's…
that's not important anymore, okay?

27:42.452 --> 27:44.913
I… I don't… I don't care.

27:45.997 --> 27:46.831
I choose you.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.126
I just want you to know.

27:54.798 --> 27:55.882
I choose you, Son.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.599
[Barry] Bye, now.

28:18.321 --> 28:20.323
[upbeat instrumental music playing]

28:22.033 --> 28:23.535
Hey, don't be looking at me, bro.

28:23.618 --> 28:26.121
The answer is no.
I'm not getting involved, Rafe.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.957
-It's not freaking happening.
-No, you are getting involved, Barry.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.667
-It's not happening.
-You wanna know why?

28:31.668 --> 28:33.545
'Cause you'll do anything for money.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.007
Let's get the hell out of here, all right?
Let's go.

28:42.887 --> 28:46.015
I still can't believe
that you're related to Denmark Tanny.

28:46.099 --> 28:46.933
Uh-huh.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.853
-Are we in the presence of a royal?
-[JJ] A king?

28:49.936 --> 28:52.981
[in British accent] We shall crown him.
All hail the lord of Tannyhill!

28:53.064 --> 28:54.399
We're not worthy!

28:54.482 --> 28:56.276
Everybody relax. Can we relax, please?

28:56.359 --> 28:58.862
-Relocate to Cat's Ass, question mark?
-[JJ] I'm with that.

28:58.945 --> 29:01.948
-How soon can we move in?
-[JJ] 'Cause I don't have a place to stay.

29:02.031 --> 29:05.285
-[Kie] Me either. Bunk beds?
-Bunk beds. Cheers to that.

29:05.368 --> 29:09.372
I just keep thinking about the letter,
the one that Limbrey sent.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.832
It had the wheat symbol on it.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.626
That must mean it has something to do
with the Royal Merchant.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.378
[JJ] Yeah. Something seems fishy.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.923
But if we find that cross, we can split it
like we were gonna split the gold.

29:19.007 --> 29:22.051
-[JJ] Yeah. I'm with that.
-And live happily ever after?

29:22.135 --> 29:24.471
[suspenseful music playing]

29:26.139 --> 29:28.308
You assaulted my father.

29:28.391 --> 29:30.059
Oh, I didn't assault anybody.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.353
He can identify the psycho
from a mile away.

29:32.979 --> 29:36.024
Why would my employee
a… a… assault your father?

29:36.107 --> 29:39.027
That's absurd. [laughs]

29:39.903 --> 29:44.365
Listen, we can keep on negotiating,
but the fact is that I want the key.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.325
-[Kie] Hey!
-Easy.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.744
And I won't stop until I have it.
I don't have a choice,

29:47.827 --> 29:49.287
which means you don't either.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.626
It's Limbrey, right? Is that right?

29:55.877 --> 29:56.711
Yes.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.048
-[John B] Is this what you're looking for?
-Yes, it is.

30:00.131 --> 30:03.760
Looking at the tide right now,
I'd say it's about 20 feet deep out there.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.888
So, if I just threw it in the channel,

30:06.971 --> 30:09.474
the probability
of you finding it again is slim to none.

30:09.557 --> 30:11.810
-You wanna give it a shot? Ready?
-No! Hey!

30:11.893 --> 30:13.102
-[gasps]
-[Limbrey gasps]

30:14.103 --> 30:16.856
[sighs] Please don't do that.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.194
Get him to back the hell up.

30:21.277 --> 30:23.029
Of course.

30:23.822 --> 30:24.697
Back up.

30:30.995 --> 30:34.874
As I have told you from the beginning,
I am willing to be reasonable.

30:37.627 --> 30:38.628
Okay.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.422
Okay?

30:41.506 --> 30:44.008
I'll give you the key,
but I want the tape.

30:44.092 --> 30:46.719
-Of course. Of course.
-Pope. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:48.054 --> 30:50.557
-You don't have to do this, okay?
-[Pope] No, it's okay.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.476
-No, dude, this is your family.
-Hey, it's fine. It's okay.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.103
It's about your dad.

30:55.186 --> 30:56.813
That's way more important.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.111
[Limbrey] Oh, you're a good friend.

31:04.904 --> 31:07.240
-The tape.
-Yes, give him the tape.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.123
[Limbrey sighs]

31:15.874 --> 31:19.752
You know, I wish
that you'd come to this decision earlier.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.088
We could have avoided
all this unpleasantness.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.175
-[John B] Nice to meet you.
-[Limbrey groans]

31:27.552 --> 31:28.970
See you around, Pope.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.221
[Kie] Just go.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.897
How long do you think we have until she
realizes she has your father's old key?

31:38.980 --> 31:40.023
Ten minutes.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.485
-Whose idea was the fake key?
-Shockingly, not mine.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.822
-Hmm, I don't know. Should we tell him?
-[Kie] Wow.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.032
I'm impressed.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.659
-Maybe you are good for something.
-[Pope] Did hell freeze over?

31:51.743 --> 31:54.120
Even a blind pig
can find an acorn at times.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.081
I actually don't know what that means,
but I saw it on Reddit.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.958
We gotta take the tape to Shoupe.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.961
[JJ] Yes, sir. Ward Cameron,
we're coming for you, big boy.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.756
-Shotgun!
-[Pope] It's Ward's turn now! [laughs]

32:04.839 --> 32:06.507
[suspenseful music playing]

32:15.683 --> 32:18.353
-[birds cawing]
-[insects buzzing]

32:21.606 --> 32:23.149
[suspenseful music playing]

32:26.736 --> 32:29.906
Hey, I'm all for a man's right
to defend himself, Rafe, but, uh,

32:30.782 --> 32:32.575
your ass is gonna get shot
carrying that thing.

32:32.659 --> 32:35.453
They ain't gonna take me alive.
I can tell you that much right now.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.665
[birds fluttering, cawing]

32:39.540 --> 32:41.501
I've never been back here before.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.838
[Barry] You don't wanna be seen,
now, do you?

32:46.965 --> 32:50.927
You know, everybody thinks
nature's all chill, right?

32:51.010 --> 32:52.637
That's such bullshit.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.974
Everything trying to kill everything else
all the time, and… and…

32:59.185 --> 33:02.271
and every single thing
has to kill to live.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.240
Killing is nature.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.707
I don't particularly dislike you, Rafe.

33:21.499 --> 33:24.502
But I ain't gonna forget
about how your father punked my ass.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.924
It's long been due
y'all pay me some respect.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.135
Hey, where you taking-- Hey, hey.

33:32.218 --> 33:35.638
-He's got a gun!
-[Shoupe] Rafe, stay where you are!

33:35.722 --> 33:39.559
Keep your hands where we can see them!
Do not move, or we will shoot!

33:40.268 --> 33:41.602
Don't go for that bag!

33:41.686 --> 33:42.562
[panting]

33:43.896 --> 33:45.606
-[guns firing]
-[officers shouting]

33:48.943 --> 33:50.486
[panting]

33:50.570 --> 33:52.697
[Shoupe] Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

33:55.158 --> 33:56.117
You hit?

33:57.118 --> 34:00.163
We don't wanna kill you, son,
but you're making it damn hard.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.958
That pistol ain't gonna work
now that it's been wet.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.669
[officer] Don't be a fool, boy.
Get rid of it.

34:06.753 --> 34:09.964
[Shoupe] Why don't you throw that gun
on out where we can see it?

34:12.425 --> 34:14.594
-[officer] Nowhere for you to go, Rafe.
-[panting]

34:14.677 --> 34:15.678
[Shoupe] All right?

34:15.762 --> 34:17.346
[Rafe] All right. All right.

34:17.430 --> 34:18.389
[Shoupe] Attaboy.

34:18.473 --> 34:22.268
Now, just ease on out away from the boat.
We'll come to you.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.103
[panting]

34:24.187 --> 34:26.147
[Shoupe] Stop! Damn it, Rafe!

34:26.981 --> 34:28.232
[Rafe grunts]

34:28.316 --> 34:31.152
[officer] Go! Move! Move! Move!
Freeze! Damn it, freeze!

34:33.279 --> 34:34.447
Go get him, boys!

34:35.740 --> 34:37.366
[grunting]

34:37.992 --> 34:40.661
Stay right there! Stay put. He's unarmed.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.248
-That turn out like you thought it would?
-All right.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.583
[Shoupe] Are you injured?

34:46.959 --> 34:49.045
Okay. Whoa.

34:49.712 --> 34:51.547
[handcuffs clicking]

34:53.966 --> 34:56.135
[Rose] They arrested him, Ward.
Do the math.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.555
The Druthers is right out there. We could
be in international water in a few hours.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.767
And I don't think it's just Rafe.
I think they have something on you.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.479
We'll take as much fuel as we can.
We will deactivate the tracking device.

35:06.562 --> 35:07.772
Rafe's lawyers can help him.

35:07.855 --> 35:11.067
It is not gonna do him any good
if now, all of a sudden, you're--

35:13.486 --> 35:14.320
Ward!

35:16.864 --> 35:17.740
Where are you?

35:20.118 --> 35:21.160
It's gonna be okay.

35:21.244 --> 35:24.122
Yeah, it's gonna be okay
because we're gonna get out of here, Ward.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.084
We can still save ourselves.
You have to think of Wheezie. You have--

35:28.167 --> 35:30.711
-I am. [shushes]
-Ward, we can do it. We can--

35:30.795 --> 35:31.712
-I am.
-Ward!

35:31.796 --> 35:36.384
It's gonna be okay, Rose,
but you gotta trust me, okay?

35:36.467 --> 35:37.552
-Yeah.
-Good.

35:42.223 --> 35:44.350
-It's okay. It's okay.
-[whimpering]

35:44.433 --> 35:46.018
[Gavin on tape] When I got to the tarmac,

35:46.102 --> 35:48.479
I saw the sheriff lying dead
on the ground.

35:48.563 --> 35:52.400
And then Ward asked me to fly the gold
to Nassau and dispose of the gun.

35:52.483 --> 35:56.821
He's protecting his son. It was
Rafe Cameron who killed Sheriff Peterkin.

35:56.904 --> 35:59.407
I… I gotta be honest with you.
I'm terrified.

35:59.490 --> 36:02.368
If anything happens to me,
I'm telling you, it was Ward Cameron.

36:02.451 --> 36:03.870
He's the one who did it!

36:04.662 --> 36:08.875
I told you, Shoupe.
Ward killed my father and Gavin,

36:08.958 --> 36:10.960
and now you know Rafe killed Peterkin.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.422
Yeah. I know, kid.

36:14.922 --> 36:16.007
I know.

36:17.633 --> 36:19.886
[suspenseful music playing]

36:19.969 --> 36:22.180
Judge Holden.
Sorry to interrupt, Your Honor.

36:22.263 --> 36:25.183
-You realize it's Sunday.
-I do, sir, but this couldn't wait.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.606
[Holden] Oh boy. Ward Cameron.

36:34.108 --> 36:35.234
What is this, Grandpa?

36:35.318 --> 36:37.278
[Holden] I'll be with you
in a second, Topper.

36:37.361 --> 36:38.863
This is Judge Holden.

[JJ trilling]
Ladies and gentlemen, Ward Cameron,

Adios! He out of there! Adios!

36:53.628 --> 36:55.046
-[JJ] Whoa, whoa!
-Do you regret it?

36:55.129 --> 36:56.214
No.

36:56.714 --> 37:00.009
He deserves all of it, and I know that.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.428
He's your dad. I get it.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.848
I'm sure it sucks to be in the middle.

-[Topper] Hey, Sarah.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.402
Hey, sorry
to be the, uh, bearer of bad news here,

37:18.486 --> 37:20.738
but they're… they're coming for your dad.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.074
Grandpa just signed the warrant.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.785
And, um, if you have
anything you want to say to him,

37:25.868 --> 37:27.787
I would do it now.
Just wanted you to know.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.539
-Thanks.
-I'll be here if you need anything, okay?

37:30.623 --> 37:34.085
[group cheering, laughing]

37:36.754 --> 37:39.465
You gotta be kidding me.
I mean, how is this happening?

37:39.548 --> 37:41.884
It's like this whole thing is a joke!

37:42.551 --> 37:45.638
[sighs] Looks like you're gonna be getting
a cellmate here in a minute, Rafe.

37:46.973 --> 37:47.807
Your father.

37:48.766 --> 37:49.892
He'll be here soon.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.104
What do you mean by that?

37:53.187 --> 37:54.605
[door opens and closes]

37:54.689 --> 37:57.316
What do you mean, my father?
Hey, talk to me!

38:09.161 --> 38:12.164
Oh my God. Can you please hurry?
I need to be there for Wheezie.

39:06.093 --> 39:09.430
-All right. Three, two, one, go.
-[Kie] Help me up. Yep. Thank you.

39:09.930 --> 39:11.057

You know that.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.864
Let me get some units
out here by the point.

39:26.947 --> 39:28.991

-Wheezie.

Go inside. Don't come out.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.043
[Wheezie cries]

39:39.126 --> 39:41.545
Listen, buddy! I know you're upset.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.298
[Ward] Yeah, I guess I am. [chuckles]

39:44.965 --> 39:49.178

you sheriff now, though. [laughs]

39:49.261 --> 39:51.347
-Yeah.
-[Ward] You deserve it!

39:51.430 --> 39:53.682

Vic, you gotta get her out of here!
She can't be here right now!
