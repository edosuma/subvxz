WEBVTT

00:02.222 --> 00:04.390
We are being watched.

00:04.392 --> 00:07.060
The government
has a secret system,

00:07.062 --> 00:11.263
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.265 --> 00:13.466
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.468 --> 00:15.033
but it sees everything,

00:15.035 --> 00:18.036
violent crimes involving
ordinary people.

00:18.038 --> 00:20.773
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:20.775 --> 00:22.741
We don't.

00:22.743 --> 00:27.279
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:27.281 --> 00:31.749
You will never find us,
but victim or perpetrator,

00:31.751 --> 00:34.686
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

NYPD.

01:28.973 --> 01:30.306
Ohh.

01:37.948 --> 01:39.982
Oh, my God.
What happened?

01:39.984 --> 01:41.550
What the hell are you doing?

01:41.552 --> 01:43.052
Catching the bad guys.

01:43.054 --> 01:45.120
Yeah.
We had three RPM's coming.

01:45.122 --> 01:47.656
You know, a little thing
called backup?

01:47.658 --> 01:50.091
You know, sometimes we wait for
it instead of shooting people,

01:50.093 --> 01:51.493
'causing mayhem
in the middle of Manhattan.

01:51.495 --> 01:52.928
It's hot as hell out here.

01:52.930 --> 01:54.763
Figure I'd save us all
some time.

01:54.765 --> 01:57.065
Listen, you're not
a lone wolf anymore, pal.

01:57.067 --> 01:59.935
You're a cop, and you need
to start respecting the job.

01:59.937 --> 02:02.737
There are rules and regulations
that come with that badge.

02:02.739 --> 02:04.806
Like you haven't bent
those rules before?

02:04.808 --> 02:06.174
Yeah, well, I don't anymore.

02:06.176 --> 02:07.575
You know who else doesn't?
The new captain.

02:07.577 --> 02:09.176
Well, that was novel.

02:09.179 --> 02:11.579
Shooting a perp in front
of hundreds of witnesses?

02:11.581 --> 02:13.081
Subtle.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.748
The guy's probably
gonna need crutches

02:14.750 --> 02:16.084
for the rest of his life.

02:16.086 --> 02:17.418
What is that,
the third or fourth guy

02:17.420 --> 02:18.987
you kneecapped this month,
Riley?

02:18.989 --> 02:20.588
Fourth, ma'am.

02:20.590 --> 02:21.789
I suppose I should
give you points

02:21.791 --> 02:23.791
for being such a good shot.

02:23.793 --> 02:26.093
You were supposed to be working
the Bowman homicide.

02:26.095 --> 02:27.962
What the hell were you doing

02:27.964 --> 02:30.764
chasing a druggie
smash and grabber in midtown?

02:30.766 --> 02:32.633
We were working
a developmental.

02:32.635 --> 02:33.968
Into what, an early grave?

02:33.970 --> 02:36.470
We got CI's all over town.

02:36.472 --> 02:39.206
Those CI's help you
close any cases yet?

02:39.208 --> 02:41.541
The CompStat numbers
are an embarrassment.

02:41.543 --> 02:44.611
Homicides are up 20%
in the last two months.

02:44.613 --> 02:46.446
I'm ready to fire me.

02:46.448 --> 02:48.815
What's going on, gentlemen?

02:48.817 --> 02:51.518
It's a heat wave, Captain.
Tempers flare.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.487
The city's taking
a turn for the worse.

02:53.489 --> 02:55.154
We need to do a better job

02:55.156 --> 02:57.490
of getting out
in front of this thing.

02:57.492 --> 03:01.060
I need to know, are you guys
working with me or against me?

03:01.062 --> 03:02.395
We just want to do our job,
Captain.

03:02.397 --> 03:03.796
So get your asses out there

03:03.798 --> 03:05.364
and show me
what you can really do.

03:05.366 --> 03:07.534
Yes, ma'am.

03:09.703 --> 03:13.872
Hey, you in the fancy suit.

03:13.874 --> 03:15.841
You're part of a team now.

03:15.843 --> 03:17.776
No more narco cowboy nonsense,

03:17.778 --> 03:20.913
and try not to shoot anyone
<i>for a few days.</i>

03:20.915 --> 03:22.081
You hear me?

03:22.083 --> 03:25.151
Loud and clear.

03:32.592 --> 03:35.226
You heard what she said.
We got work to do.

03:35.228 --> 03:37.896
Relax, Lionel.

03:37.898 --> 03:39.364
Listen, Mr. Fabulous.

03:39.366 --> 03:40.999
I got a mortgage, alimony,

03:41.001 --> 03:42.601
and a kid going to college
in a few years.

03:42.603 --> 03:44.235
You see this place?

03:44.237 --> 03:45.836
This is my livelihood.

03:45.838 --> 03:48.073
And it's filled
with too much bureaucracy

03:48.075 --> 03:49.441
and not enough direct action.

03:49.443 --> 03:51.242
This is my real life,
Detective.

03:51.244 --> 03:53.778
Not some superhero
cover identity.

03:56.082 --> 03:58.283
Okay.

03:58.285 --> 03:59.717
I hear you.

03:59.719 --> 04:00.718
Yeah.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.753
No, I'll work on it.

04:02.755 --> 04:04.622
I've spent the past two decades

04:04.624 --> 04:06.624
learning how not to color
inside the lines.

04:06.626 --> 04:09.594
May take me a second
or two to figure it out.

04:11.931 --> 04:13.263
Riley.

04:13.265 --> 04:15.265
Detective Riley,
we have a new number.

04:15.267 --> 04:17.701
Now's not the best time,
Professor.

04:17.702 --> 04:19.202
I'm at work.

04:19.204 --> 04:21.071
Circumventing
suspicious employers

04:21.072 --> 04:22.806
is part of our new challenge,
John.

04:22.808 --> 04:25.375
Please hurry.

04:34.118 --> 04:35.451
<i>Go get it, Bear.</i>

04:35.453 --> 04:39.288
Go get it.
Go get it.

04:39.290 --> 04:40.456
<i>Go get 'em, Bear.</i>

04:40.458 --> 04:41.725
<i>Go get 'em.</i>

04:41.727 --> 04:43.326
Ms. Shaw, please.

04:43.328 --> 04:45.394
He doesn't need
any more encouragement.

04:45.396 --> 04:48.397
Don't you want him to catch it?

04:48.399 --> 04:51.267
Not if it involves finding rat
entrails in our new office, no.

04:51.269 --> 04:52.401
Bear, <i>hier.</i>

04:54.505 --> 04:57.840
While the machine may have
given us a place of operation,

04:57.842 --> 05:02.111
it didn't account for
our financial situation.

05:02.113 --> 05:04.747
I'm afraid your meals and rent
are going to have to start

05:04.749 --> 05:06.915
coming out of
your actual paychecks.

05:06.917 --> 05:08.684
Well, it's a good thing
I'm working two jobs.

05:08.686 --> 05:11.253
The makeup counter
pays like crap.

05:11.255 --> 05:13.122
And do you know how expensive
a nice pair of heels are?

05:13.124 --> 05:14.422
What a racket.

05:14.424 --> 05:17.760
Until I access some
auxiliary funds,

05:17.762 --> 05:19.594
we have no choice

05:19.596 --> 05:23.265
but commit to our identities'
socioeconomic status.

05:23.267 --> 05:24.799
Copy that.

05:24.801 --> 05:28.836
Ramen and two buck chuck
for the rest of the month.

05:28.838 --> 05:31.873
We'll need to make this fast.

05:31.875 --> 05:34.442
I'm on the new captain's hit
list and my partner's.

05:34.444 --> 05:35.977
What, did you shoot
somebody else?

05:35.979 --> 05:38.180
<i>You have to be</i>
<i>more careful, John.</i>

05:38.182 --> 05:40.314
The identities that
the machine created for us

05:40.316 --> 05:43.450
are precious commodities
not to be taken for granted.

05:43.452 --> 05:45.186
It was hot out.

05:48.323 --> 05:49.623
Never mind.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.225
Let's hear about
that new number.

05:51.227 --> 05:53.695
Andre Cooper.

05:53.697 --> 05:56.564
Born and raised in The Bronx.

05:56.566 --> 06:01.134
Former longshoreman turned
professional social liaison.

06:01.136 --> 06:02.236
A social what?

06:02.238 --> 06:03.370
A professional wingman.

06:03.372 --> 06:04.971
He's the guy people hire

06:04.973 --> 06:06.340
when they can't pick up women
on their own.

06:06.342 --> 06:08.709
Why leave a union gig

06:08.711 --> 06:10.578
<i>to teach desperate men</i>
<i>pick-up tricks?</i>

06:10.580 --> 06:12.646
I suggest we get close to
Cooper's operation and find out.

06:12.648 --> 06:15.015
You mean go undercover
as a client?

06:15.017 --> 06:17.217
Not it, Finch.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.220
Oh, don't worry, Reese.

06:20.222 --> 06:21.421
Harold and I decided

06:21.423 --> 06:22.823
that we needed somebody

06:22.825 --> 06:24.557
with a few more people skills

06:24.559 --> 06:26.259
and a little less hair gel.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.283
Relax, Fusco.

06:51.285 --> 06:54.419
He's probably just some con
artist who's in over his head.

07:28.922 --> 07:30.155
what I was dealing with here.

07:30.157 --> 07:31.555
Could have been
a little more up-front.

07:31.557 --> 07:32.791
Excuse me?

07:32.793 --> 07:34.592
He bought you
a two-day package.

07:34.594 --> 07:37.261
This is more like a--
like a five-day situation.

Yeah, that's right.

07:43.503 --> 07:45.603
Hey, look, I don't need
to take this crap.

you've made an effort,

07:57.649 --> 07:59.283
that you didn't
just roll out of bed

07:59.285 --> 08:01.952
and throw on yesterday's
suit with a new shirt.

08:01.954 --> 08:03.753
Holy crap.
That is yesterday's suit.

08:03.755 --> 08:05.289
I am here to teach you

08:05.291 --> 08:06.656
how to earn
a woman's affections,

08:06.658 --> 08:08.025
not trick her into it,

08:08.027 --> 08:10.327

you need to do better.

08:10.329 --> 08:11.828
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

08:11.830 --> 08:13.697
'Cause if this is you
dressing to impress,

08:13.699 --> 08:15.164
well, I am not,

The fireproof fabric.

08:29.848 --> 08:31.547

boxing matches, too.

You want to go a few rounds?

Let's get to work.

Shopping.

09:16.014 --> 09:19.549
I think the word you're
looking for is spartan.

09:19.551 --> 09:24.087
Yes, and well-hidden.

09:24.089 --> 09:27.023
She gave you and the kids
a nice, new home.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.559
I'll ask again.

09:29.761 --> 09:32.028
The machine needs a favor.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.563
No.

09:33.565 --> 09:36.766
She knew you'd
doubt her motives.

09:36.768 --> 09:38.701
Let her make it up to you.

09:38.703 --> 09:43.238
She promises it will be worth
something to all three of you.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.208
What is it that
the machine wants?

09:46.210 --> 09:48.811
I don't know yet.

09:48.813 --> 09:51.881
She gave me very little
to go on.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.682
She can't talk to me
the way she used to

09:53.684 --> 09:55.951
with Samaritan watching,

09:55.953 --> 09:59.288
but I do know where to start.

09:59.290 --> 10:01.156
Excellent.
A wild goose chase.

10:01.158 --> 10:06.595
I'd like to think of it
more as a scavenger hunt.

10:24.847 --> 10:26.314
Where's your partner?

10:26.316 --> 10:31.385
Um, re-interviewing
suspects on a case.

10:31.387 --> 10:34.022
How is that
working out for you?

10:34.024 --> 10:35.656
Pfft.
How's it look?

10:35.658 --> 10:36.991
One patch is not enough.

10:36.993 --> 10:38.626
Yeah, I could
have told you that

10:38.628 --> 10:41.229
from your
chewed-up fingernails.

10:41.231 --> 10:43.564
That's a pretty good
parlor trick, Detective.

10:43.566 --> 10:45.399
You putting those skills
to work out in the field yet?

10:45.401 --> 10:48.402
I got a lead on
Wendy Montgomery's murder,

10:48.404 --> 10:51.038
that realtor who was shot
walking home from work.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.707
<i>Looked like a mugging.</i>

10:52.709 --> 10:54.475
Yeah, her husband
was the prime suspect,

10:54.477 --> 10:55.976
but we didn't have
any real leads.

10:55.978 --> 10:58.778
Well, we do now.

11:01.883 --> 11:05.552
He's been emailing
with a known hit man.

11:05.554 --> 11:07.420
How did you get these?

11:07.422 --> 11:11.258
You know those developmentals
I've been working on?

11:11.260 --> 11:13.060
You really need to know
more than that?

11:13.062 --> 11:16.429
If you want to play
fast and loose, fine,

11:16.431 --> 11:18.865
but make sure you nail him
with something solid.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.367
Copy that, ma'am.

11:24.238 --> 11:26.673
<i>Finch?</i>

11:26.675 --> 11:28.341
<i>Finch, where are you hiding?</i>

11:28.343 --> 11:30.877
Did you discover anything new
about Andre Cooper?

11:30.879 --> 11:32.879
<i>Well, I scrubbed</i>
<i>through his inbox,</i>

11:32.881 --> 11:36.749
and I found some emails between
Cooper and a client's ex-wife.

11:36.751 --> 11:38.084
They were sleeping together.

11:38.086 --> 11:40.253
Not the best business decision.

11:40.255 --> 11:42.788
The client didn't think so
either, so he sent

11:42.790 --> 11:44.891
a bunch of emails threatening
<i>to kill our wingman.</i>

11:44.893 --> 11:46.525
So Mr. Cooper's
romantic entanglements

11:46.527 --> 11:48.293
have put him in danger.

11:48.295 --> 11:50.863
That's what I thought until
I got into his voicemails.

11:50.865 --> 11:52.364
<i>Our boy was subpoenaed</i>
<i>ten days ago.</i>

11:52.366 --> 11:53.766
What for?

11:53.768 --> 11:55.434
An investigation
into a missing gun shipment

11:55.436 --> 11:57.002
from the New York
Container Terminal,

11:57.004 --> 11:58.737
Cooper's old workplace.

11:58.739 --> 12:00.906
That container disappeared
<i>around the same time</i>

12:00.908 --> 12:02.941
our boy swapped
his well-paying dockworker gig

12:02.943 --> 12:05.710
for his sketchy career helping
socially incompetent men

12:05.712 --> 12:07.078
pick up women.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.480
Sounds like a solid avenue
of investigation.

12:09.482 --> 12:12.150
Yeah, I could really use
an extra hand here, Finch.

12:12.152 --> 12:15.420
Well, that's why we recruited
Detective Fusco.

12:15.422 --> 12:19.791
Yeah, uh, Fusco's gonna be
a bit more preoccupied

12:19.793 --> 12:21.258
than we thought.

12:21.260 --> 12:22.993
I don't know.

12:22.995 --> 12:24.995
This just ain't me.

12:24.997 --> 12:26.831
And who wears cufflinks anyway?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.499
How do you put these
things on by yourself?

12:28.501 --> 12:31.068
You're right, cufflinks
and perfectly tailored pants

12:31.070 --> 12:32.904
are for suckers that
just want to meet women.

12:32.906 --> 12:34.939
Maybe we could get you
a tracksuit and a Barcalounger.

12:34.941 --> 12:36.574
What's wrong with a tracksuit?

12:36.576 --> 12:38.675
Are you a track star, Lionel?

12:38.677 --> 12:41.745
I didn't think so.
Try harder.

12:44.649 --> 12:46.283
Does this stuff really work?

12:46.285 --> 12:47.952
Trust me.

12:47.954 --> 12:49.320
You think I just roll out
of bed looking like this?

12:49.322 --> 12:50.787
I don't know.

12:50.789 --> 12:52.589
Women aren't lining up
to date a guy

12:52.591 --> 12:54.825
who alternates football jerseys
for his casual wardrobe.

12:54.827 --> 12:56.092
Easy, pal.

12:56.094 --> 12:57.828
Look, don't you love it

12:57.830 --> 12:59.963
when a girl fixes her hair up
all nice for a date, hmm?

12:59.965 --> 13:03.366
Wears that hot dress
just for you?

13:03.368 --> 13:06.202
You think four-inch heels
are comfortable?

13:06.204 --> 13:08.505
Never really gave it
any thought.

13:08.507 --> 13:11.841
They probably hurt like hell,
but women wear them anyway.

13:11.843 --> 13:13.642
Why?
Because guys like it.

13:13.644 --> 13:15.945
So let's give the ladies
a little respect

13:15.947 --> 13:19.282
and show them that
you can make an effort too.

13:19.284 --> 13:21.217
Eh.

13:21.219 --> 13:24.487
Once you have their attention,
it's up to you to keep it.

13:24.489 --> 13:26.155
You gonna show me
how to do that too?

13:26.157 --> 13:28.023
One thing at a time, Don Juan.

13:28.025 --> 13:31.126
Why don't we start with
you losing those Florsheims.

13:31.128 --> 13:34.663
You look like a cop.

13:34.665 --> 13:36.665
When's the last time
you had a girlfriend, Lionel?

13:36.667 --> 13:38.033
None of your business.

13:38.035 --> 13:39.568
See?

13:39.570 --> 13:41.370
I can't help you
if you don't open up.

13:41.372 --> 13:44.006
I'm like a therapist
in that way.

13:44.008 --> 13:46.141
No thanks, doc.
I'm not interested.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.013
All right, her name was Rhonda.

13:51.015 --> 13:52.680
All right.

13:52.682 --> 13:54.049
We went out a bunch of times,

13:54.051 --> 13:55.817
but she just--
just kind of faded away.

13:55.819 --> 13:57.585
These things
never work out anyway.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.554
See? That's your
problem right there.

13:59.556 --> 14:01.556
- You're cynical.
- I'm not cynical.

14:01.558 --> 14:02.924
I just know that people
are terrible.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.660
Oh, man.

14:05.662 --> 14:07.428
A cynical misanthrope.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.863
Look, I-I don't know
what they did to you

14:08.865 --> 14:10.031
at that insurance job,

14:10.033 --> 14:11.232
but it made you sour,

14:11.234 --> 14:13.701
and women do not like sour.

14:13.703 --> 14:15.503
Well, I don't know
how to break it to you,

14:15.505 --> 14:18.372
but I'm not a unicorn
and rainbows kind of guy.

14:18.374 --> 14:21.042
Look, I'm not saying
that you need to be naive.

14:21.044 --> 14:23.544
Just a little less pessimistic.

14:23.546 --> 14:25.446
I don't see a ring
on your finger.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.348
What's your story?

14:27.350 --> 14:30.384
I'm not in a mental state to be
in a relationship right now.

14:30.386 --> 14:33.086
Those who can't do,
teach, right?

14:34.088 --> 14:36.924
Nah.

14:36.926 --> 14:38.291
So how'd you get
in the business?

14:38.293 --> 14:39.626
I'm good with people.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.261
Yeah.
That still remains to be seen.

14:41.263 --> 14:44.598
Uh, I was always helping
my friends meet girls,

14:44.600 --> 14:47.100
and one time my buddy asked me
to help him on the side,

14:47.102 --> 14:48.201
said he'll pay.

14:48.203 --> 14:49.735
A business is born.

14:49.737 --> 14:52.439
Two years later,
he's getting married.

14:52.441 --> 14:54.074
So have some hope.

14:54.076 --> 14:55.741
I got hope...

14:55.743 --> 14:57.310
that this speech
is gonna end soon.

14:57.312 --> 14:59.145
You keep living in the past,

14:59.147 --> 15:00.746
you're gonna wind up alone.

15:00.748 --> 15:04.384
Can't run away
from your past either.

15:12.893 --> 15:15.728
Mr. Egret, it's an honor.

15:15.730 --> 15:17.396
I've read a lot about you, sir.

15:17.398 --> 15:21.100
Your tour in the Gulf,
your work with Blackwater.

15:22.335 --> 15:25.170
Who's the hottie?

15:25.172 --> 15:28.140
She's none of your concern.

15:40.419 --> 15:42.353
An AT4, anti-tank shoulder
launched munitions system

15:42.355 --> 15:47.325
with 84-millimeter rounds and
a firing range of 300 meters.

15:47.327 --> 15:51.362
Nice piece of machinery.

15:51.364 --> 15:52.964
50,000, as agreed.

15:52.966 --> 15:54.532
It was nice doing business
with a legend.

15:54.534 --> 15:58.236
<i>Hope we get to work</i>
<i>together again someday.</i>

16:00.038 --> 16:02.340
Mr. Egret, would
you mind telling us

16:02.342 --> 16:04.041
what you plan to do
with the missile?

16:04.043 --> 16:06.511
Just out of curiosity.

16:12.450 --> 16:17.187
You know?
I would mind very much.

16:27.298 --> 16:29.332
What are we gonna do with this?

16:29.334 --> 16:31.568
I don't know yet,

16:31.570 --> 16:34.737
but I am truly enjoying
this new side of you, Harold.

16:34.739 --> 16:36.806
It's very unexpected.

16:36.808 --> 16:39.242
Dare I ask how you procured
that amount of money?

16:39.244 --> 16:41.878
It involved some
breaking and entering.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.713
I take it these men will just
continue to sell munitions

16:43.715 --> 16:45.181
on the black market?

16:45.183 --> 16:47.650
Have a little faith, Harry.

16:53.825 --> 16:55.491
Put the case down.

16:55.493 --> 16:56.659
Don't you move!

16:56.661 --> 16:59.261
<i>You see?</i>

16:59.263 --> 17:01.263
She's still doing her job,
Harold.

17:01.265 --> 17:03.566

17:03.568 --> 17:05.367

17:34.598 --> 17:35.697
I'll handle the intros.

17:35.699 --> 17:37.599
- Okay, but--
- No talking.

17:37.601 --> 17:39.367
Listening.
Make eye contact.

17:39.369 --> 17:41.369
Be polite,
but don't be a doormat.

17:41.371 --> 17:43.771
Smile, but not too much.

17:43.773 --> 17:45.139
You don't want to look
like a crazy person,

17:45.141 --> 17:47.775

18:28.683 --> 18:30.817
although I have heard
in some cultures

18:30.819 --> 18:33.086
spilling drinks on a woman
is a mating ritual.

18:33.088 --> 18:34.487
I was just starting
not to hate you.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.922
You got to relax, man.

18:35.924 --> 18:38.258
You're treating this
like some kind of a job.

18:38.260 --> 18:40.526
Guess I'm a little rusty.

18:43.697 --> 18:45.631
You know her?

18:45.633 --> 18:50.436
No, but I will soon.

18:50.438 --> 18:53.005
Dre!

18:53.007 --> 18:54.173
Aghh!

18:56.477 --> 18:58.777
Hey, Mick!
Oh, wow.

18:58.779 --> 19:00.112
- It's been...
- Almost a year.

19:00.114 --> 19:01.814
Mick is an old friend
from the docks.

19:01.816 --> 19:03.182
We've known each other
a long time.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.883
Yeah, I'd say.

19:04.885 --> 19:06.151
Way before you'd ever come
in a place like this.

19:06.153 --> 19:08.987
So true.
So what got you here?

19:08.989 --> 19:10.522
Ah, my cousin's
staying at the hotel.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.890
I thought I'd come down
and get a quick drink.

19:11.892 --> 19:13.058
Who's this guy?
Client?

19:13.060 --> 19:14.992
This is Lionel.

19:14.994 --> 19:17.028
He's new.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.230
It was gift from a friend,
uh, a guy I knew.

19:19.232 --> 19:20.898
Hey, don't worry, killer.

19:20.900 --> 19:23.067
Andre actually hooked me up
with my wife.

19:23.069 --> 19:25.403
He's the best pick-up artist
you'll ever meet.

19:25.405 --> 19:27.872
Hey, you live in midtown,
right?

19:27.874 --> 19:29.240
Midtown East?

19:29.242 --> 19:30.641
Yeah, that's right.

19:30.643 --> 19:34.312
We got to grab a meal
sometime soon.

19:34.314 --> 19:36.881
It's great seeing you, man.
Take care.

19:44.857 --> 19:45.923
I saw that.

19:45.925 --> 19:50.160
Oh, boy.

19:50.162 --> 19:52.763
Hey, pal.

19:52.765 --> 19:54.865
Checking out my girl?

19:54.867 --> 19:58.535
You know what? I didn't
realize she was anyone's girl.

19:58.537 --> 20:00.371
Yeah, right.

20:00.373 --> 20:01.705
What the--

20:06.643 --> 20:08.711
NYPD. You're cut off
for the rest of the night.

20:08.713 --> 20:10.013
You understand me?

20:13.450 --> 20:15.085
Who the hell are you?

20:33.470 --> 20:35.838
You finish making
your statement?

20:35.840 --> 20:37.673
I did.

20:37.675 --> 20:39.475
Do you have a statement,

20:39.477 --> 20:43.013
like why you lied to me
about what you do for a living?

20:43.015 --> 20:45.014
Am I under investigation,
Lionel?

20:45.016 --> 20:47.383
Did you do something to
warrant investigation, Andre?

20:47.385 --> 20:50.352
No, of course not.
You're avoiding the question.

20:54.659 --> 20:55.991
Fusco.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.693
<i>Hold up, Lionel.</i>

20:57.695 --> 20:59.729
<i>I think our number</i>
<i>might be a perp after all.</i>

20:59.731 --> 21:01.496
<i>What'd you find?</i>

21:01.498 --> 21:04.066
Open homicide in Red Hook
on a man named Milo Jacobs.

21:04.068 --> 21:07.036
He worked security on the docks
up until nine months ago,

21:07.038 --> 21:09.071
around the same time
that gun shipment went missing.

21:09.073 --> 21:12.308
And I have got phone calls here
between Milo and Cooper.

21:12.310 --> 21:14.876
Maybe they stole
that shipment together.

21:20.883 --> 21:24.352
That's my partner checking in.

21:24.354 --> 21:27.388
Well?

21:27.390 --> 21:30.058
I lied because cops
don't hire wingmen.

21:30.060 --> 21:33.027
The guys find out, they'll
bust my chops to my grave.

21:37.232 --> 21:39.533
Well, the day's not done,

21:39.535 --> 21:42.036
and your friend
paid in advance, so...

21:42.038 --> 21:44.072
What?
You want to keep going?

21:44.074 --> 21:47.442
You're a hero.
We should capitalize on that.

21:47.444 --> 21:50.744
I have another event
we could catch.

21:50.746 --> 21:52.680
What's the worst
that could happen?

22:01.857 --> 22:04.091
The chef's confession
is on there.

22:04.093 --> 22:05.793
You got Wendy Montgomery's
husband.

22:05.795 --> 22:07.094
- Well done, Riley.
- Hmm.

22:07.096 --> 22:08.895
I won't ask about the eye.

22:08.897 --> 22:11.631
Where's your partner?
I want to congratulate him too.

22:11.633 --> 22:13.967
Fusco's taking the lead
on another case.

22:13.969 --> 22:15.402
What's next?

22:15.404 --> 22:17.570
That car dealership owner
who got shot?

22:17.572 --> 22:19.873
He was embezzling money
from his own company.

22:19.875 --> 22:21.941
You think his employees
were in on it?

22:21.943 --> 22:23.442
I think they found out
where he was hiding the money

22:23.444 --> 22:24.711
and killed him for it.

22:24.713 --> 22:26.245
I tapped into
their credit reports.

22:26.247 --> 22:27.947
<i>They've been spending</i>
<i>a lot of money</i>

22:27.949 --> 22:28.948
since their boss' death.

22:28.950 --> 22:30.249
Do I want to know

22:30.251 --> 22:32.819
how you got
those credit reports?

22:32.821 --> 22:35.221
Bad morning?

22:35.223 --> 22:38.625
Oh, my pocketbook still
smells like cigarettes.

22:38.627 --> 22:40.326
Quitting has me edgy as hell,

22:40.328 --> 22:42.728
but it was either the patch
or a hypnotherapist,

22:42.730 --> 22:44.397
and I don't believe
in that hippie nonsense.

22:44.399 --> 22:47.766
Maybe we can use that edginess
of yours to our advantage.

22:47.768 --> 22:49.601
I'm intrigued.

22:49.603 --> 22:51.770
Tell me more.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.977
I told you no more
developmentals.

22:58.979 --> 23:00.412
I was working up a lead--

23:00.414 --> 23:01.913
Your numbers are down, Riley.

23:01.915 --> 23:03.515
If you don't start
closing more cases,

23:03.517 --> 23:04.782
I'm gonna ship you off
to evidence lockup

23:04.784 --> 23:07.485
and find someone who can.

23:16.094 --> 23:18.596
I'm Detective Riley.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.798
Which one of you
wants to go first?

23:25.103 --> 23:27.204
I've already been questioned
about Mr. Bowman's murder.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.373
Didn't know anything then.
Don't know anything now.

23:29.375 --> 23:32.376
I heard a rumor Mr. Bowman
had a bit of a temper.

23:32.378 --> 23:36.846
I also heard you were sick of
him taking it out on you.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.882
Yeah, well,
you'd be sick of it too.

23:38.884 --> 23:40.684
He'd scream at us
if we didn't sell enough

23:40.686 --> 23:43.554
or if we weren't
pushing upgrades.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.290
Yeah, well, not everyone
wants fog lights.

23:46.292 --> 23:48.725
My ballbuster of a captain
out there?

23:48.727 --> 23:51.194
She is all over me
about closing up this case

23:51.196 --> 23:52.629
before the end of the day.

23:52.631 --> 23:54.397
<i>I'm just worried about my job,</i>

23:54.399 --> 23:58.468
so what do you say
we make a deal?

23:58.470 --> 24:01.071
I don't know what you mean.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.740
- I don't know anything.
<i>- Come on, Lenny.</i>

24:03.742 --> 24:05.874
You guys found out where Bowman
was keeping the money,

24:05.876 --> 24:07.310
and you killed him for it,
right?

24:07.312 --> 24:08.911
- That's not true.
- Sure, it is.

24:08.913 --> 24:11.914
What I don't know
is which one of you

24:11.916 --> 24:14.448
wants to make a deal
with me first.

24:16.835 --> 24:18.101
What kind of deal?

24:18.490 --> 24:22.758
You help me close up this case,
give me half the money,

24:22.760 --> 24:26.228
and we'll make this
all go away.

24:26.230 --> 24:30.165
Hell, we'll even make sure that
Lenny takes the fall for it.

24:30.167 --> 24:32.267
Because Barry's gonna say it
was all your idea anyway.

24:32.269 --> 24:34.436
He's a liar!
This was all Barry!

24:34.738 --> 24:36.805
Half?

24:36.807 --> 24:39.507
Half.

24:39.509 --> 24:42.544
Fine, but this all falls
on Barry, not me, right?

24:45.414 --> 24:47.248
Does that work for you,
Captain?

24:49.552 --> 24:51.820
Looks like you closed
another case, Riley.

24:51.822 --> 24:55.323
Keep it up, you'll get
that set of steak knives.

25:01.363 --> 25:04.065
The most fun
I've had in a while.

25:04.067 --> 25:05.499
- Good game.
- You too.

25:05.501 --> 25:07.201
Love to celebrate,

25:07.203 --> 25:10.171
but since you're on a roll,
it's a priority homicide.

25:10.173 --> 25:12.272
It just came in from
the Commissioner's Office.

25:12.274 --> 25:14.207
Illegal street vendor
recanted his statement.

25:14.209 --> 25:15.609
The vendor's scared.

25:15.611 --> 25:17.711
Be scarier than the guy
who made him clam up.

25:17.713 --> 25:19.880
Yes, ma'am.

25:32.259 --> 25:34.027
You see, Lionel?

25:34.029 --> 25:35.595
Eye contact.

25:35.597 --> 25:37.297
<i>Yeah, Lionel.</i>

25:41.568 --> 25:43.436
Women's charities are
a great way to meet ladies.

25:43.438 --> 25:46.806
You're always outnumbered,
and it's for a good cause.

25:46.808 --> 25:48.240
Isn't that a little tacky?

25:48.242 --> 25:49.876
I prefer the word "Strategic."

25:51.778 --> 25:53.412
Stop primping, gorgeous.

25:53.414 --> 25:55.381
Somebody's watching you.

25:56.717 --> 25:59.719
Lady by the silent auction.

25:59.721 --> 26:01.820
Great smile.

26:01.822 --> 26:03.455
What do we do?

26:03.457 --> 26:04.756
She's already doing
all the work for you.

26:04.758 --> 26:08.260
Now off you go.

26:14.401 --> 26:16.001
Are you feeling
a little exposed

26:16.003 --> 26:18.269
having an anti-tank
missile in our possession

26:18.271 --> 26:20.705
in the middle of Manhattan,
or is it just me?

26:20.707 --> 26:24.342
Samaritan won't be looking for
a college professor with an AT4.

26:24.344 --> 26:25.944
It's not Samaritan
I'm worried about.

26:25.946 --> 26:27.111
Then who?

26:27.113 --> 26:28.346
Homeland Security.
NYPD.

26:28.348 --> 26:30.949
An errant meter maid.

26:30.951 --> 26:32.183
Egret?

26:32.185 --> 26:35.019
And you are?

26:35.021 --> 26:38.856
The freakin' Dalai Lama.
I'm Jerry.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.425
The guy who was sent by
the other guy you contacted

26:40.427 --> 26:41.625
about the thing
you wanted to sell?

26:41.627 --> 26:43.994
You have a buyer for us?

26:47.099 --> 26:49.967
I thought Egret
would be more, uh, badass.

26:49.969 --> 26:52.636
I mean, you got that rep,
you know?

26:52.638 --> 26:56.040
You don't look so tough.

26:56.042 --> 26:59.309
That's because I have
only two modes, Jerry...

27:01.012 --> 27:03.981
calm and furious.

27:03.983 --> 27:06.183
It's a rare person
that sees the latter

27:06.185 --> 27:08.785
and lives to talk about it.

27:08.787 --> 27:11.121
Okay.

27:11.123 --> 27:12.655
Okay.

27:12.657 --> 27:14.291
I gotcha.

27:14.293 --> 27:16.159
Everyone relax now.

27:16.161 --> 27:18.361
Follow me.

27:28.339 --> 27:30.506
<i>I-I like it too.</i>

27:30.508 --> 27:32.208
I don't know what it is,
but I like it.

27:33.377 --> 27:35.177
Oh, come on, Fusco.

27:35.179 --> 27:37.413
Just ask her
for her number already.

27:37.415 --> 27:40.316
We need to figure out if
your new buddy's a killer.

27:47.090 --> 27:48.991
<i>Wait a sec.</i>

27:48.993 --> 27:51.260
<i>Who's this guy?</i>

27:54.831 --> 27:57.432
Longshoreman.

27:57.434 --> 28:01.536
Fusco, grab Andre
and go out the back exit now.

28:01.538 --> 28:05.073
I-- I'm sorry.
I-I have to go.

28:05.075 --> 28:07.042
What are you doing?
Why didn't you get her number?

28:07.044 --> 28:08.576
You're in danger.

28:08.578 --> 28:10.545
We need to get you out of here
right now, come on.

28:21.190 --> 28:23.424
Hey there.

28:28.464 --> 28:31.231
Oh, wicked stomach cramps.

28:51.386 --> 28:54.288
Back up!

28:54.290 --> 28:55.922
Mick, you don't know
what you're doing.

28:55.924 --> 28:58.392
I'm afraid you got that
the other way around, pal.

29:01.463 --> 29:03.296
Get him in.
Bring 'em both.

29:03.298 --> 29:04.297
Let's go.

29:04.299 --> 29:05.298
Let's go, move!

29:25.121 --> 29:28.489
You know, I went back
to the art gallery.

29:28.491 --> 29:30.357
That fake security guard,
he high-tailed it out of there.

29:30.359 --> 29:32.291
They must want
something from Andre.

29:32.293 --> 29:33.727
Otherwise he'd already be dead.

29:33.729 --> 29:35.562
Sorry.

29:35.564 --> 29:38.331
Mickey and Cooper must have
stolen that shipment together.

29:38.333 --> 29:40.901
I bet someone
double-crossed someone.

29:40.903 --> 29:43.905
We need to track Mickey's van.

29:49.643 --> 29:51.177
<i>You're a cop now.</i>

29:51.179 --> 29:53.413
<i>Full access pass</i>
<i>to domain awareness?</i>

29:53.415 --> 29:57.216
Thanks to Big Brother,
we can be watching too.

30:05.091 --> 30:07.159
This has been time-stamped
20 minutes ago.

30:07.161 --> 30:09.428
Let's move.

30:11.264 --> 30:12.998
I can't, Shaw.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.067
Captain Moreno handed me
a priority homicide.

30:15.069 --> 30:16.334
What do you think
this is gonna be

30:16.336 --> 30:17.502
if we don't get to Fusco soon?

30:17.504 --> 30:19.038
She's got me
under a microscope.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.773
If she figures out
who I really am,

30:20.775 --> 30:23.108
Samaritan will too,
and we'll all be dead.

30:25.112 --> 30:27.212
Riley.

30:27.214 --> 30:28.846
Yes, ma'am.

30:28.848 --> 30:31.349
I'm on my way to interview
the vendor now.

30:31.351 --> 30:35.019
Well, he's been a little bit
hard to find, ma'am--

30:35.021 --> 30:38.022
Fine, but I'm taking the dog.

30:43.361 --> 30:47.131
You want to tell me
what you got me involved in?

30:47.133 --> 30:49.867
I'm sorry, Lionel.

30:49.869 --> 30:52.737
I thought Mickey was
out of my life for good.

30:52.739 --> 30:55.306
What did you ass clowns do?

30:55.308 --> 30:56.740
Not me.

30:56.742 --> 30:58.041
Mickey.

30:58.043 --> 31:00.611
Some dealer named Dominic
paid him off

31:00.613 --> 31:02.879
to disappear
a container full of guns.

31:02.881 --> 31:05.048
He just deleted it
out of the system.

31:05.050 --> 31:07.050
DA suspects Mickey's involved.

31:07.052 --> 31:08.785
They want me to testify.
I said I wouldn't.

31:08.787 --> 31:10.454
How come?

31:12.890 --> 31:17.060
You know how hard it is to
turn your back on your friends

31:17.062 --> 31:21.331
because it's
the right thing to do?

31:21.333 --> 31:23.133
Yeah.

31:23.135 --> 31:26.503
I know a little bit about that.

31:26.505 --> 31:29.905
Then you understand why
I didn't say anything.

31:29.907 --> 31:33.743
What are you girls
gossiping about?

31:33.745 --> 31:35.512
Andre here was just telling me
what a moron you are

31:35.514 --> 31:37.079
for kidnapping a cop.

31:37.081 --> 31:39.081
<i>Yeah, that came as a bit</i>
<i>of a surprise.</i>

31:39.083 --> 31:40.683
Since when are you
hanging out with cops, Dre?

31:40.685 --> 31:43.620
Lionel's a client,
and he's a good man.

31:43.622 --> 31:44.920
<i>Let him go.</i>

31:44.922 --> 31:46.588
It's too late for that, buddy.

31:46.590 --> 31:48.991
Now just tell me what
you've been saying to the DA

31:48.993 --> 31:50.159
about my little side job?

31:50.161 --> 31:51.927
I already told you.
Nothing.

31:51.929 --> 31:53.328
I want to believe that.

31:53.330 --> 31:55.264
You've known me for 15 years.

31:55.266 --> 31:57.033
You're like a brother.
You know I'm telling the truth.

31:57.035 --> 31:59.769
You were my brother,
but you abandoned me.

31:59.771 --> 32:01.270
Because you got greedy.

32:01.272 --> 32:04.039
You took an honest job
and you turned it dirty.

32:04.041 --> 32:05.374
I made a business deal.

32:05.376 --> 32:08.343
Yeah, with
a criminal street gang.

32:08.345 --> 32:10.812
Now you got good men
doing bad things.

32:10.814 --> 32:12.648
Good men do bad things
all the time.

32:12.650 --> 32:14.783
No, you're worse
than those dealers,

32:14.785 --> 32:17.451
'cause you turned on
your friends, like Milo.

32:17.453 --> 32:19.888
I did what I had to do.

32:19.890 --> 32:21.890
Look, if you kill a cop,

32:21.892 --> 32:24.325
the feds are gonna
come looking for you.

32:24.327 --> 32:26.360
No.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.730
They're gonna come looking
for you,

32:28.732 --> 32:30.999
'cause that is how
I'm gonna set it up.

32:34.436 --> 32:36.904
Get 'em ready.

32:40.909 --> 32:43.077
I saw nothing.
I told them--

32:43.079 --> 32:45.145
You were in Red Hook
the night the victim died.

32:45.147 --> 32:46.747
We traced your cell.

32:46.749 --> 32:49.650
I wasn't even there.

32:49.652 --> 32:51.384
I'm not lying.

32:51.386 --> 32:54.221
What if I help your memory?

32:54.223 --> 32:57.024
Here's how this works.

32:57.026 --> 32:59.426
You remember something useful,

32:59.428 --> 33:02.830
and I give you this envelope

33:02.832 --> 33:05.733
in exchange for one
of these lovely handbags.

33:05.735 --> 33:08.101
These are genuine, right?

33:09.737 --> 33:12.239
Sell me this purse,

33:12.241 --> 33:14.407
and you get to start
a new life.

33:16.611 --> 33:19.946
But first you need
to tell me what you saw.

33:23.416 --> 33:25.718
You're certain we can trust
these gentlemen?

33:25.720 --> 33:27.386
Trust 'em?
Of course not.

33:27.388 --> 33:28.921
You can't trust anyone, Egret.

33:28.923 --> 33:31.557
What world do you live in?

33:31.559 --> 33:34.260
This is gonna be interesting.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.929
It's going to be a lot less
interesting once we're dead,

33:36.931 --> 33:38.064
Ms. Groves.

33:50.043 --> 33:52.311
Okay, Bear, on three.

33:52.313 --> 33:55.314
One, two...

34:10.663 --> 34:11.929
<i>Zoek,</i> Bear.

34:11.931 --> 34:14.431
<i>Zoek.</i>

34:28.681 --> 34:30.414
I hired a friend to make sure

34:30.416 --> 34:32.016
this container never
reaches its destination.

34:32.018 --> 34:33.617
Don't worry.

34:33.619 --> 34:36.687
You'll probably die of
heat stroke before you drown.

34:39.791 --> 34:42.759
Let's go.

34:53.817 --> 34:58.252
The famous Mr. Egret.

34:58.254 --> 35:02.289
It seems you materialized
out of nowhere.

35:02.291 --> 35:05.926
Now you are everywhere.

35:05.928 --> 35:07.828
How is that?

35:07.830 --> 35:10.564
I'm a very private person.

35:14.903 --> 35:17.070
Yes.

35:17.072 --> 35:19.639
I am as well.

35:19.641 --> 35:21.842
You're lucky
you know my friend, Jerry.

35:21.844 --> 35:25.512
We don't trust outsiders.

35:38.325 --> 35:40.159
150,000.

35:40.161 --> 35:41.995
Would you like to count it?

35:41.997 --> 35:44.864
Mr. Egret and I are certain
the money's all there.

35:47.434 --> 35:48.934
No, I can't do this.

35:48.936 --> 35:50.269
- Harold--
- I'm sorry.

35:50.271 --> 35:53.439
This missile
is no longer for sale.

35:53.441 --> 35:57.276
I thought you were a man
of your word, Mr. Egret.

35:57.278 --> 36:00.879
Not if it involves selling
a rocket launcher to the mob.

36:00.881 --> 36:03.015
Any mob.

36:03.017 --> 36:06.651
That happens to be a line
I'm not willing to cross.

36:07.853 --> 36:10.322
She knows you so well, Harold.

36:10.324 --> 36:13.224
Now we get to kill two birds
with one stone.

36:19.131 --> 36:22.801
Should we tie 'em up
just in case?

36:26.139 --> 36:28.205
What was the point
of all this, Ms. Groves?

36:28.207 --> 36:31.242
How did this ridiculous
journey help anyone?

36:31.244 --> 36:34.078
Let me show you.

36:45.156 --> 36:46.824
You're right.

36:46.826 --> 36:48.926
These cufflinks
are good for something.

36:48.928 --> 36:52.195
Neat trick.

36:52.197 --> 36:54.998
Who are you really, Lionel?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.200
A concerned third party.

37:00.171 --> 37:02.072
What now?

37:02.074 --> 37:06.209
I think your friend wasn't
kidding about the heat stroke.

37:06.211 --> 37:09.179
There's no way
we can bust out of here.

37:10.414 --> 37:11.514
<i>Hey!</i>

37:11.516 --> 37:13.183
Hey!

37:13.185 --> 37:14.451
<i>Hey!</i>

37:14.453 --> 37:16.719
You think anyone can hear us?

37:24.060 --> 37:26.561
What are you doing here?

37:28.965 --> 37:30.232
Me?
What are you doing?

37:30.234 --> 37:32.634
I thought you were out
playing detective.

37:32.636 --> 37:36.037
My priority homicide
traced back to our number.

37:36.039 --> 37:37.939
The guy selling
knock-off handbags

37:37.941 --> 37:40.575
saw a dock worker
kill their victim.

37:40.577 --> 37:43.578
That homicide you picked up
was Milo Jacobs?

37:43.580 --> 37:45.580
That's our guy.

37:45.582 --> 37:47.115
Where's Fusco?

37:49.084 --> 37:51.619
Here somewhere.

37:51.621 --> 37:53.121
Bear, <i>zoek.</i>

37:58.427 --> 38:00.228
Mickey and his goons
are still out there.

38:00.230 --> 38:02.296
You get Fusco
and the pick-up artist.

38:02.298 --> 38:04.065
I'm gonna go hunting.

38:04.067 --> 38:05.266
<i>Hey!</i>

38:05.268 --> 38:06.467
Fusco?

38:06.469 --> 38:07.568
<i>We're in here!</i>

38:16.077 --> 38:17.745
Nice of you to show up,
partner.

38:17.747 --> 38:19.146
I was about to close
my third case of the day.

38:19.148 --> 38:20.581
Wanted to make sure
you didn't die

38:20.583 --> 38:22.249
before I had a chance
to brag about it.

38:22.251 --> 38:24.518
Mickey's still out there.
I'm gonna get him.

38:44.939 --> 38:46.139
They never give you
enough ammo.

39:10.063 --> 39:11.663
Look out, Lionel!

39:20.707 --> 39:23.241
<i>Bear, heel!</i>

39:26.980 --> 39:28.413
Thanks for the backup.

39:28.414 --> 39:29.750
Anytime.

39:32.585 --> 39:34.719
Nice moves, wingman.

39:34.721 --> 39:37.589
You too.

39:43.163 --> 39:44.762
Hey, guys, give me a hand here,
will you?

39:48.834 --> 39:50.701
Come on.

39:53.705 --> 39:56.774
I have you to thank for
this lovely knockoff, Riley?

39:56.776 --> 39:58.609
It wasn't my color.

39:58.611 --> 40:03.247
I heard your old one
smelled like an ashtray.

40:03.249 --> 40:04.615
Who are these mooks?

40:04.617 --> 40:06.750
Latvian mob.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.385
We got an anonymous phone call.

40:08.387 --> 40:10.187
Found 'em in
a Chinatown sweatshop.

40:10.189 --> 40:12.122
Very strange case.

40:12.124 --> 40:14.391
They were all shot
in the knees.

40:14.393 --> 40:15.859
If I didn't know any better,

40:15.861 --> 40:18.629
I'd think it was your doing,
Riley.

40:18.631 --> 40:20.596
Great work today, guys.

40:20.598 --> 40:23.099
You really managed
to turn things around.

40:23.101 --> 40:25.234
Thank you, Captain.

40:25.236 --> 40:27.704
Drinks on me tonight.

40:32.442 --> 40:34.243
I, uh...

40:34.245 --> 40:38.047
I guess you figured out
how to be a good cop after all.

40:38.049 --> 40:41.116
It's a process, Lionel.

40:41.118 --> 40:44.720
Listen, about those drinks
tonight, I, uh--

40:44.722 --> 40:47.423
I got somewhere to be.

40:47.425 --> 40:49.592
Cooper came through
on the dating front?

40:56.508 --> 40:58.112
Right over there.

41:00.469 --> 41:03.072
Thank you.

41:03.074 --> 41:04.306
I'll be back.
Okay?

41:04.308 --> 41:06.408
Okay.

41:08.011 --> 41:10.845
A club soda and a glass
of chardonnay, please.

41:10.847 --> 41:12.814
You spill your drink
on her yet?

41:14.450 --> 41:17.285
That's a mating ritual
in some cultures.

41:19.823 --> 41:22.824
I'm testifying against
Mickey and his boys.

41:22.826 --> 41:25.193
You were right.

41:25.195 --> 41:26.961
You can't run from your past,

41:26.963 --> 41:29.530
at least not without
getting shot at, right?

41:32.667 --> 41:35.937
Remember, eye contact,
confidence.

41:35.939 --> 41:37.605
Make sure you're having fun.

41:37.607 --> 41:39.273
Andre, I got this.

41:41.276 --> 41:42.943
I know you do.

41:42.945 --> 41:45.613
But if you ever need
a refresher course,

41:45.615 --> 41:47.114
you give me a call.

41:47.116 --> 41:49.316
Done.

41:53.455 --> 41:54.688
Here you go.

41:54.690 --> 41:55.822
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:55.824 --> 41:57.190
Thank you.

41:57.192 --> 41:59.226
Welcome back.

42:02.329 --> 42:05.866
Our Latvian friends won't be
needing these supplies anymore.

42:21.715 --> 42:23.549
This was the machine's plan?

42:26.387 --> 42:29.889
She believes in saving your
irrelevant numbers, Harold.

42:29.891 --> 42:32.191
And while you can't access

42:32.193 --> 42:34.559
any of your old
bank accounts right now...

42:37.563 --> 42:39.932
things are looking up.

42:50.276 --> 42:51.777
The only way the machine

42:51.779 --> 42:54.613
could give us this kind of
financial assistance

42:54.615 --> 43:00.352
was to do so in a way that
Samaritan would never discover.

43:00.354 --> 43:04.088
Ill-gotten gains
put to good use.

43:06.192 --> 43:09.294
Maybe it's time
you give her a second chance.

43:11.897 --> 43:16.201
What will we do
with the missile?

43:16.203 --> 43:19.403
I'm sure we'll think
of something.
