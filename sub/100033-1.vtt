WEBVTT

00:04.743 --> 00:07.137
- Previously on
"New Amsterdam."

00:07.181 --> 00:08.051
This may be one
of the last things I do.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.313
- Max!

00:09.357 --> 00:10.662
I am your doctor, Max.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.186
I'm taking you off the chemo
and radiation.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.274
I'm gonna find you
a different regimen

00:13.317 --> 00:14.927
and I'm gonna save your life.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.974
Could you, um, message this
to Dr. Valentina Castro?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.410
- Max's DNA?

00:19.454 --> 00:21.064
- I was actually here
to talk to Max

00:21.108 --> 00:23.545
about extending my leave.
- For how long?

00:23.588 --> 00:25.155
- Like, forever.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.070
- You know I got you, right?

00:28.637 --> 00:30.030
- The placenta previa
ruptured.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.379
I was about to call 911.

00:31.422 --> 00:34.382
- Max, the baby won't survive
another one.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.861
- So we have to get her out.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.778
- Luna.

01:28.610 --> 01:31.917
- Your turn.

01:34.398 --> 01:36.574
- It's always my turn.

01:52.460 --> 01:56.594
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:56.638 --> 01:58.161
Come here.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.555
- I know, I know, I know.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.689
Yeah.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.910
Hi.
Good morning, Luna.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.912
How you doing?
How you doing?

02:11.348 --> 02:13.263
How are you feeling?

02:13.307 --> 02:16.310
- Oh, not myself just yet.

02:16.353 --> 02:19.269
- It's okay, 'cause
I'm all over baby duty today.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.228
Oh, she wants her mama.

02:24.274 --> 02:27.451
- Hi.
Hi, Luna.

02:27.495 --> 02:32.456
♪ Baby, baby sweet baby

02:32.500 --> 02:36.460
♪ There's something that
I just got to say ♪

02:36.504 --> 02:40.334
- ♪ Baby, baby sweet baby

02:40.377 --> 02:44.381
both: ♪ I didn't mean
to run you away ♪

02:44.425 --> 02:45.730
- Okay, Luna.
Hit it.

02:45.774 --> 02:49.734
- ♪ Baby, baby sweet baby

02:49.778 --> 02:51.780
- Hey, Max.
- How can we help?

02:51.823 --> 02:53.825
- What's the key factor
in how much pain meds

02:53.869 --> 02:56.045
we prescribe to patients?
- How much pain they're in.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.177
Is this a trick question?
- Yes.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.308
- I thought it seemed too easy.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.266
- Well, the key factor
isn't pain.

02:59.309 --> 03:00.571
It's race.
- Ah.

03:00.615 --> 03:01.877
- When white
and black patients present

03:01.920 --> 03:03.313
with identical levels of pain,

03:03.357 --> 03:04.488
doctors tend to prescribe
the white patients

03:04.532 --> 03:05.924
high grade opioids.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.230
- And what do
the black patients get?

03:07.274 --> 03:08.536
- A lecture on how
to tough it out

03:08.579 --> 03:10.102
and a handful of Tylenol.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.061
Wow, so everybody loses.
- Exactly.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.236
That's why I want
New Amsterdam's

03:13.280 --> 03:14.368
patient bill of rights
to guarantee

03:14.411 --> 03:15.630
that each patient's pain

03:15.673 --> 03:18.198
is treated equitably
and responsibly.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.199
- Luna, if you think that's
a good idea,

03:19.242 --> 03:20.156
go ahead and be super cute.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.810
You're good.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.295
- Who's that little Muppet?
Look at me!

03:28.338 --> 03:30.514
Oh, let's see if I can touch
your nose with my nose!

03:30.558 --> 03:31.907
Oh!
- Yeah.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.387
Uh, how--how can I help?
Can you repeat it?

03:33.430 --> 03:34.823
- Yes.
Sorry, Capitan.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.694
Here's the sitch.
All right, come with me.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.305
So, I'll give you one guess
what all those kids

03:38.348 --> 03:40.045
in there have in common.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.699
- They all just heard you do
15 verses of "Baby Shark"?

03:41.743 --> 03:42.613
- Walked right into that one.
- Yeah.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.224
- No, they are all transgender

03:44.267 --> 03:45.529
and they have all been
denied medical care

03:45.573 --> 03:47.270
thanks to these so-called
"conscience laws"

03:47.314 --> 03:48.924
allowing hospitals
to just freely discriminate.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.795
- Hospitals are denying them
transition care?

03:50.839 --> 03:53.102
- No, hospitals are denying
them any care whatsoever.

03:53.145 --> 03:55.887
So I'm proposing that
New Amsterdam starts a fund

03:55.931 --> 03:59.021
to help shoulder the cost.
- A lot of art on these walls.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.589
- Yes, Max, art therapy is
a big part of what we do here,

04:01.632 --> 04:02.807
but I'm gonna need you
to focus up, okay?

04:02.851 --> 04:04.983
- What if we create
an art show annually,

04:05.027 --> 04:06.246
auction your patients' work,

04:06.289 --> 04:07.551
and use that money to,
you know,

04:07.595 --> 04:10.641
build the fund
you're talking about?

04:10.685 --> 04:13.383
- Who's the best
medical director ever?

04:13.427 --> 04:15.211
Who's the best medical
director ever?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.734
Your daddy!

04:16.778 --> 04:20.434
- 30% of doctors are over 63.
- Yeah, just one second.

04:20.477 --> 04:22.131
Marsha, we had a bit
of grunting

04:22.174 --> 04:24.394
after a morning diaper
and there is an extra bottle

04:24.438 --> 04:25.656
in there in case she has
a sudden growth spurt.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.745
Okay, I love you, baby.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.921
You have a good day.
- See you in five minutes.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.446
- Probably.
Uh, so doctors that are old.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.099
What's the, uh, problem?

04:34.143 --> 04:36.276
- Uh, we will soon face
an epidemic when they retire.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.886
- Vijay, you're not trying
to tell me something, are you?

04:37.929 --> 04:39.583
Are you hanging up your spurs?
- Certainly not.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.324
It's not about me.
- Oh, well, then--

04:41.368 --> 04:42.760
But you are over 60, right?

04:42.804 --> 04:44.284
- Legally, I don't have
to answer that.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.676
- Vijay, you look great.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.374
I'm just saying
that if doctors

04:47.417 --> 04:48.940
retire later
than most Americans,

04:48.984 --> 04:50.638
then the problem is not
that they're leaving.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.988
It's that they're sticking
around past their prime.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.859
- What?
No, no.

04:54.903 --> 04:57.906
You're twisting my words.
With age comes wisdom.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.082
- Yeah, and declining
mental acuity.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.693
Look, I--what we should do
is create new programs

05:02.737 --> 05:05.217
for senior physicians
like mentorships, you know?

05:05.261 --> 05:06.741
And--and lower patient loads.

05:06.784 --> 05:07.959
In fact,
that's a really good idea.

05:08.003 --> 05:10.440
Would you look into that?

05:10.484 --> 05:12.312
- Senior physicians?

05:12.355 --> 05:14.705
- The result speak
for themselves.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.099
- I'm rarely at
a loss for words,

05:17.142 --> 05:19.797
but, uh, wow.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.756
- "Wow" works.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.758
I want all my patients
to say wow.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.934
Wow is my preferred reaction.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.457
And I think they will.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.850
With precision-targeted
therapy--

05:28.893 --> 05:32.332
I mean,
you are the proof.

05:32.375 --> 05:36.858
- Thank you, Dr. Castro,
for, um,

05:36.901 --> 05:37.902
saving my life.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.862
Thanks isn't really enough,
is it?

05:40.905 --> 05:42.820
- It is for me.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.606
Look at this.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.172
By targeting your
defective DNA

05:47.216 --> 05:49.827
and not carpet bombing
your entire body with chemo,

05:49.871 --> 05:52.830
your tumor
is finally shrinking.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.355
All three of your blood lines
are in their normal range.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.445
- And I actually gained
a pound or five

05:58.488 --> 05:59.837
but who's counting?

05:59.881 --> 06:02.231
- I mean,
six more months like this

06:02.274 --> 06:03.406
and you'll be cured.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.062
Sorry.

06:09.281 --> 06:10.892
Cured?

06:12.894 --> 06:17.681
- Max, I know you've missed
Dr. Sharpe.

06:17.725 --> 06:20.597
If she were here,
she would say the same thing.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.470
You beat the odds.
You won the cancer lottery.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.737
- Sorry, I gotta--I gotta run.

06:29.780 --> 06:33.044
But, um, thank you,
Dr. Castro.

06:35.046 --> 06:37.048
Thank you.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.837
- Max.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.447
Max.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.972
Max.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.895
- Where--where--
where's Georgia?

06:57.939 --> 07:00.289
- Fractured left femur
and possible concussion.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.943
- Give me Bloom's vitals.

07:01.986 --> 07:04.249
- Alright, 110,
BP 150 over 95.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.469
O2 stats at 100%.
- Georgia?

07:06.513 --> 07:07.427
- Max.
- Huh?

07:07.470 --> 07:08.602
- Max.
Hey, Max.

07:08.645 --> 07:09.559
- What?
- You need to give me Luna.

07:09.603 --> 07:10.734
- No.
- Yes.

07:10.778 --> 07:11.779
She needs to be examined.
- No.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.171
- Yes.
- No, no, no.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.608
No, no, no.
- It's okay, it's okay.

07:14.651 --> 07:15.565
- Why? Why?
- Just give me her.

07:15.609 --> 07:16.697
It's okay.
I'll take her.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.176
She'll be fine,
I promise you.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.308
It's okay.
- Luna?

07:19.351 --> 07:20.483
- It's okay.
It's okay.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.658
- Max.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.574
Max.

07:24.618 --> 07:25.923
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.273
Thank God.

07:28.317 --> 07:31.712
It's not fair.

07:31.755 --> 07:32.626
Where's Luna?
- She's fine.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.062
- They're examining her.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.411
They'll bring her back
in just a few.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.674
- Max, your head.
- I'm good.

07:37.718 --> 07:41.286
- I want a CT on both of them.

07:41.330 --> 07:44.289
- Is everybody else okay?

07:47.336 --> 07:50.470
- No, where's Sharpe?

07:50.513 --> 07:52.297
Where's Sharpe?

07:55.257 --> 07:57.128
Where's Sharpe?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.831
- Max, take a look at this.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.485
- Another case came in.
Alma Pearson.

08:05.528 --> 08:06.964
She's a type 1 diabetic.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.618
This morning she suffered
full-blown ketoacidosis.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.577
It's her third one this year.
- Hey, Alma.

08:10.620 --> 08:11.795
I'm Dr. Goodwin.

08:11.839 --> 08:14.189
You wanna tell me
what happened?

08:18.976 --> 08:20.630
- She's been rationing
her insulin again.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.850
This time she could have died.

08:22.893 --> 08:26.201
- Alma, I'm gonna help you,
but you have to talk to me.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.032
- What's there to say?

08:31.075 --> 08:35.123
When I was first diagnosed,
insulin cost $21 a vial.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.255
Now it's $250.

08:37.299 --> 08:40.041
I'm a substitute teacher
and I can't afford it.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.874
I can't afford to live.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.137
How can you help with that?

08:51.226 --> 08:53.837
- Alma's the eighth diabetic
to come in this week.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.535
One guy was trying
to make insulin on his own

08:55.578 --> 08:58.320
in his garage.
- Hmm.

08:58.363 --> 09:01.236
Who supplies our insulin?
- Uh, Pacentia.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.890
- Pacentia.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.022
Yeah, okay, Alma,
we're--we're on this.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.807
Um, Kenmari,
I'm gonna go ahead

09:06.850 --> 09:08.591
and green light your plan.
- Uh, what's my plan?

09:08.635 --> 09:09.679
- Your plan to terminate
our contract

09:09.723 --> 09:11.594
with Pacentia Pharmaceuticals.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.726
- That's not my plan.
- No?

09:12.769 --> 09:14.205
Maybe it was mine.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.859
- Okay, Max,
how are we gonna buy insulin?

09:15.903 --> 09:16.904
- We're not gonna
buy insulin anymore.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.427
We're gonna make our own.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.041
- Hey, baby.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.826
- Good morning,
beautiful black woman.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.176
- Oh, yeah,
6:00 a.m. with pillow creases

09:28.219 --> 09:29.525
on my face?

09:29.569 --> 09:30.700
- Especially with
pillow creases.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.223
- Oy, keep talking like that,

09:32.267 --> 09:33.616
I might just have
to marry you.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.313
- Oh, that's gonna happen.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.880
But right now I just need you
back from San Francisco.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.055
I can't take it anymore.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.362
- I know.
I know.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.624
Two more weeks and counting.

09:41.668 --> 09:42.886
- Mm-hmm.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.105
- How much time do you have?

09:45.672 --> 09:47.064
- Three minutes.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.283
- You better make
the most of it.

09:48.326 --> 09:49.240
- Mm-hmm.
Yes, please.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.981
Thank you.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.680
- Dr. Reynolds, we could use
your help in the ED.

09:53.723 --> 09:54.724
- I'll be right there.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.076
- Are you sure that
you have some time?

09:59.120 --> 10:02.645
- I'm--I'm positive, all right?
We got 2 1/2 minutes.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.908
- Dr. Reynolds?
- What, Nottingham?

10:04.952 --> 10:06.431
- One of the interns
on our rotation

10:06.475 --> 10:07.868
is always showing up late.

10:07.911 --> 10:08.956
And when he is here,
I can't find him.

10:08.999 --> 10:11.175
- Cut him.
- Seriously?

10:11.219 --> 10:12.612
- Yeah, I don't got time
for dead weight

10:12.655 --> 10:13.700
or interruptions.

10:13.743 --> 10:17.138
- Okay, great.
Oh, hi, Evie.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.269
What are you guys--

10:25.712 --> 10:27.235
- Hey, love.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.845
Just calling to check
on Raffi and Saleem.

10:28.889 --> 10:29.803
Are they, uh--are they
at least trading off

10:29.846 --> 10:31.195
with the barfing now?

10:31.239 --> 10:33.937
- No, they're still
in perfect sync,

10:33.981 --> 10:37.114
like two violently ill
figure skaters.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.464
- Now Sameera says she's sick.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.944
- No, no, no, no.

10:40.988 --> 10:41.815
She's faking to stay home
with the boys.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.251
Don't believe that hype.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.992
- Uh, I told her
to get ready for school

10:45.035 --> 10:48.038
but the big headline
is head lice on Harper.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.779
- Again?
Are you kidding me?

10:49.823 --> 10:51.476
That kid's head is like
a cot at Rikers.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.218
I was having trouble
finding someone

10:54.262 --> 10:55.742
to take care of the boys.
Now with Harper,

10:55.785 --> 10:58.222
I'm gonna have
to cancel my patients.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.486
- Ah, I'm so sorry, Martin.
I-I wish I could be there.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.227
- Yeah, just promise
you'll be home by 7:00

11:03.271 --> 11:05.665
to put everyone to bed
so I can start drinking.

11:05.708 --> 11:08.015
- Daddy?

11:08.058 --> 11:10.495
- Sameera is not faking.
I-I gotta go.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.715
- Oh.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.122
- Hey.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.341
- Interesting.
Tweety Bird?

11:30.385 --> 11:32.474
I always thought of you
as a Yosemite Sam kind of guy.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.476
- Well, that's probably because
of my outlaw vibe.

11:34.519 --> 11:38.175
And I am not seeing
any bathroom breaks on here.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.786
- The residents are all taking
their board exam today

11:39.829 --> 11:41.309
so we're severely understaffed.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.006
I have everyone covering
three different wards.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.052
It's an impossible day.
- No, no, no.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.749
Nothing is impossible, Gladys,

11:46.793 --> 11:48.359
as long as you get me out
of here by 6:00 p.m.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.710
Oh, also can you, um--
can you find me some shoes?

11:50.753 --> 11:52.407
- Shoes, yep.
Got it.
