WEBVTT

00:28.095 --> 00:30.398
<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

00:30.398 --> 00:32.533
So what do you think
we should do about Frank?

00:33.300 --> 00:35.503
<i>Family first, right?
A snitch is a snitch.</i>

00:35.503 --> 00:37.605
<i>Tell me who's calling you,</i>

00:37.605 --> 00:39.306
'cause I know you're
hiding something from me.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.810
- Have we, uh, moved forward on Rollins?
- Not yet.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.579
Uh, no.
I can't keep this up anymore.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.747
You're joking me, right?

00:46.747 --> 00:48.282
Your parents think you're dead.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.184
<i>It's the only way
to guarantee your safety</i>

00:50.184 --> 00:51.452
while I build my case.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.587
That girl Effie?
She tried to kill me.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.290
You signed RSJ,
the billionaire?

00:56.290 --> 00:57.391
I did that shit.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.160
First, they buy
our crypto coins online.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.262
<i>Then they use that coin
to buy coffee through the app.</i>

01:01.262 --> 01:03.397
This the motherfucker
who killed Zeke.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.665
The fuck I am.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.534
<i>What's up, Cane?
You good?</i>

01:06.534 --> 01:08.669
Never been better,
'cause I know you killed Zeke.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.604
<i>Did you read
this report you gave me?</i>

01:10.604 --> 01:12.373
It says
Lorenzo Tejada's fingerprints

01:12.373 --> 01:14.375
match the partial prints
at Zeke's crime scene.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.611
Do not jump to conclusions.
Don't do anything.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.513
The plug just dropped off
a bunch of guns on us.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.283
I know this crazy-ass white dude.
He's always asking me for shit.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.551
Set it up.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.625
You're lucky you only got grazed.
I ain't even know I was hit.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.495
<i>What business
do you have with the Feds?</i>

01:34.495 --> 01:37.431
She's been pressuring me
to help her solve her case.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.700
- What case?
- The murder of Dante Spears.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.801
You know anything about that?

01:40.801 --> 01:42.636
Do you know when Monet and Lorenzo
won't be in the house?

01:42.636 --> 01:43.771
I'll leave a key.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.307
<i>When you get to the house,
check under the back doormat.</i>

01:46.307 --> 01:48.676
911, someone just
broke into my house!

01:48.676 --> 01:50.311
Please!

01:50.311 --> 01:51.345
Look, don't do this.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.613
There's no way
you get away with this.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.815

Anything else, Nancy Drew?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.551
What do you think
Detective Whitman wanted?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.320
Shit, fuck if I know.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.422
Whitman's had it in for my family
ever since he found out

03:41.422 --> 03:43.257
Zeke was sleeping
with the professor.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.926
He stalked me, harassed me,
vandalized my car.

03:45.926 --> 03:49.530
Which is all documented,
as you know, Ms. Sullivan.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.931
I was scared for my life.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.233
I didn't know what this fool
was gonna do to my daughter.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.935
My client has the right
to protect her home

03:54.935 --> 03:58.472
and her family from trespassers
in the state of New York.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.573
Are you done?

03:59.573 --> 04:02.610
One more thing, Mrs. Tejada.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.311
How did you have time
to grab your gun

04:04.311 --> 04:05.946
when Detective Whitman
charged at you?

04:05.946 --> 04:09.316
Why are you treating my wife
like she's the suspect?

04:10.451 --> 04:12.353
She--she's the victim.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.521
I almost lost her
and my daughter

04:14.521 --> 04:16.991
because you couldn't keep
a maniac on his leash.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.959
<i>I mean...</i>

04:18.959 --> 04:22.396
I heard his voice after
I heard my daughter scream.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.465
I went to grab my gun
before I approached him.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.866
I'm glad I did,
because if I hadn't--

04:25.866 --> 04:27.501
She'd probably be dead.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.902
And to answer
your next question,

04:28.902 --> 04:30.838
yes, her firearm is registered.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.740
Oh, trust me.
I've already looked into that.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.375
Good.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.743
Just so I can cross check...

04:36.910 --> 04:38.912
<i>I think my client
has given you and your team</i>

04:38.912 --> 04:40.414
<i>plenty to work with.</i>

04:40.414 --> 04:41.949
Her and her mother's stories align.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.852
Uh, you should, uh,
have everything you need.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.500
- You okay?
- Yeah.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.569
Thank you for your time,
Mrs. Tejada.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.971
Yeah, yeah, you're welcome.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.352
Everything should be back
to normal by end of day.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.721
Good, 'cause I'm tired of these
people runnin' around my house

05:20.721 --> 05:22.022
makin' my shit look hot.

05:22.022 --> 05:25.959
Mm-hmm. Well, you shot a cop,
so your shit is hot.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.828
Be careful
about your next few moves.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.497
You never know
who could be watching.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.000
And make sure the rest
of your family's alibis are tight

05:33.000 --> 05:34.101
in case we have to go to court.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.037
Wait. Whitman's file.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.072
I got rid of that shit.

05:38.072 --> 05:40.674
I don't want anyone
to ever even know I had it.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.975
I want this all behind me.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.644
That's a good idea.

05:43.644 --> 05:47.014
I mean, it was
a stolen police file.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.016
And, um...

05:49.016 --> 05:50.851
Your questions about Lorenzo?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.820
Well, you were right.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.089
I was jumping to conclusions.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.390
We all good.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.126
Good.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.671
Thank you, Salim.
You're welcome.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.939
Good morning, class!

06:11.939 --> 06:13.574
Good morning.
<i>Good morning!</i>

06:13.574 --> 06:16.443
Okay, I know you all are familiar
with Councilman Tate.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.512
You mean
future Congressman Tate?

06:18.512 --> 06:21.014
Ah, that's the spirit!
Thank you, BruShaundria.

06:21.014 --> 06:24.418
Yes, yes, keep hope alive.

06:24.418 --> 06:27.588
Okay, so here's here to help us
with our topic today.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.823
Uh, is America
the land of rebirth,

06:29.823 --> 06:32.025
redemption, and reinvention?

06:32.025 --> 06:36.630
Well, second chances
are the foundation of America.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.099
Mm.
- European settlers came here

06:39.099 --> 06:42.770
in search of political
and religious freedom.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.606
- Reinvention. And--
- And in the process,

06:45.606 --> 06:47.007
took the land of the Indigenous.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.176
Look, reinvention is a privilege

06:49.409 --> 06:51.578
that was afforded
based on who you are

06:51.578 --> 06:54.715
and, well, let's just face it,
the color of your skin.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.518
Must everything
be brought back to race?

06:57.518 --> 06:58.685
Damn right.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.821
You know, generations ago,
my family came here...

07:00.821 --> 07:03.190
- Please don't say it.
- On the <i>Mayflower.</i>

07:03.423 --> 07:04.525
He said it. He said it.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.626
Let--let him finish.
Let him finish.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.660
Thank you.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.495
Leaving Europe, their family,

07:08.495 --> 07:10.998
and their language behind
for a chance at a better life.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.600
Why do you think America has
the highest immigration rate?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.870
America the idea and America the reality
are two completely different beasts.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.005
Facts.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.473
I mean, the settlers taught us

07:19.473 --> 07:21.508
that you have to take
someone else's chance to get your own.

07:21.508 --> 07:25.078
Inequality--that is the foundation
of America, not redemption.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.480
<i>Hello?</i>

07:26.480 --> 07:27.881
Look at our prison system.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.116
The incarcerated are told

07:29.116 --> 07:31.618
they'll get a do-over
after they do their time,

07:31.618 --> 07:34.188
yet we stigmatize them
and take away their voting rights

07:34.188 --> 07:36.190
so they can't get jobs or housing.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.991
What kind of second chance is that?

07:37.991 --> 07:39.560
Sounds personal.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.961
Ooh.
- Maybe it is.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.496
Is that a problem, Jackie?

07:42.496 --> 07:44.998
You see that? That's the stigma
that she's talking about.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.568
Black Americans are incarcerated

07:47.568 --> 07:49.736
at five time the rate of whites.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.639
We can't have conversations
about equity or redemption

07:52.639 --> 07:54.074
without acknowledging race.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.542
<i>Yeah, I agree.</i>

07:55.542 --> 07:58.512
I mean, we all saw what happened
to my brother last semester.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.114
If he were BIPOC,
he wouldn't be on Wall Street right now.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.483
He'd be locked up
with no chance at redemption.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.018
You're talking
about decisions people make,

08:05.018 --> 08:07.054
not chances they're given.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.756
Look, if second chances are
so innately American,

08:09.756 --> 08:12.025
don't we all deserve one
despite our decisions?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.994
<i>Hmm.</i>

08:13.994 --> 08:16.230
<i>Okay, so the words "we" and "all"</i>

08:16.230 --> 08:18.866
<i>are used a lot in this country,</i>

08:18.866 --> 08:23.070
<i>but who believes that only
applies to a privileged few?</i>

08:25.906 --> 08:27.674
Uh, Professor Bennet?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.910
Can I have a word? Excuse me.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.980
Councilman Tate.
Hey, Tariq.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.683
I might have some useful information
for you

08:36.683 --> 08:38.752
based on our last conversation.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.187
Really?

08:40.187 --> 08:43.790
What kind of information
might that be, young brother?

08:43.790 --> 08:47.060
Information that
your Fed friends might like.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.631
I'm listening.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.535
A'ight, the streets are saying
International Guap killed Zeke.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.972
Supposedly it's a get-back kill
for all the bodies that dropped from GTG.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.007
He's dead now.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.943
The streets are saying this, huh?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.011
Yeah.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.746
You know, wrapping up
the murder investigation

09:05.746 --> 09:07.581
of New York's top NBA-bound
college student

09:07.581 --> 09:10.083
is exactly what they need
for press right now,

09:10.083 --> 09:12.920
seeing as Zeke is
my generation's Len Bias.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.156
Mm, all right.
I appreciate that.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.558
I, uh, will pass the information along.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.594
Let me get up out of here.
I'm running late.

09:27.601 --> 09:31.038
KeKe, our resident
tech investment guru,

09:31.038 --> 09:33.273
has brought us a step closer
to jumping in bed

09:33.273 --> 09:37.044
with emerging Italian
tech company Navona.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.912
Yes, and with
their newest products,

09:38.912 --> 09:41.081
they are projected to be
a giant in the industry

09:41.081 --> 09:42.649
within the next two years.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.785
And thanks to a little
relationship-building,

09:44.785 --> 09:46.653
we are first in line to invest.

09:46.653 --> 09:49.723
RSJ,
as our newest limited partner,

09:49.723 --> 09:51.692
we wanted to give you
the opportunity

09:51.692 --> 09:54.127
<i>to see the company
and meet the primary players</i>

09:54.127 --> 09:55.195
<i>before we consummate.</i>

09:55.195 --> 09:56.897
I'll be bringing Brayden along

09:56.897 --> 09:58.765
<i>to assist
with whatever we need.</i>

09:58.765 --> 10:00.000
And we also thank you

10:00.000 --> 10:01.802
for letting us use your jet
so last-minute.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.370
That's what it's there for.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.872
Brayden and Tariq have pulled together
some Navona research for us.

10:05.872 --> 10:08.141
Yes, I translated some
of their public statements

10:08.141 --> 10:10.811
and their local assessments
of management.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.347
<i>And it all matches
KeKe's analysis.</i>

10:13.347 --> 10:17.017
I'm interested to see
what I can get out of them face-to-face.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.187
Tariq, you'll be there
to translate?

10:20.187 --> 10:23.323
Tariq's a little junior
for a trip like this.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.192
But not too junior
to get my business?

10:26.693 --> 10:28.362
Unless there's
some other qualifications

10:28.362 --> 10:31.098
as to why you would have
your African American intern

10:31.098 --> 10:34.735
in meetings with me
but not the Italians.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.872
Tariq may be an intern,
but we hope he has a bright future here.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.641
Then you won't mind if I extend
an invitation to Tariq,

10:41.641 --> 10:45.012
considering he's the only one in this room
who speaks Italian.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.046
It's true.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.116
No objections whatsoever.

10:49.116 --> 10:52.319
Well, actually, me and my girlfriend
have plans this weekend.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.688
Oh, she'll understand,
I'm sure.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.990
I mean, what I was thinking was,
since we're going to explore

10:56.990 --> 10:59.259
the potential of a tech company,

10:59.259 --> 11:02.796
she's an engineering major
who specializes in robotics.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.364
You don't have to sell me.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.134
There's plenty of room
on the plane for your plus-one.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.803
Oh, and, Lucas, uh,

11:09.803 --> 11:12.439
I got us covered
with the junior team.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.776
Uh, the...

11:15.776 --> 11:19.679
Navona principals are
expecting me, so...

11:19.679 --> 11:22.816
I've found that in fact-finding missions
like these,

11:22.816 --> 11:25.685
sometimes the best approach is to...

11:25.685 --> 11:27.921
disrupt expectations,

11:27.921 --> 11:29.189
<i>make them sell me,</i>

11:29.189 --> 11:32.893
as opposed to letting them feel
that they have it all wrapped up.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.862
Trust me.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.231
It'll push negotiations
into our favor.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.402
You see?

11:42.402 --> 11:46.339
This is why I knew this
would be such a great fit.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.309
I'm learning so much already.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.178
I'll see the rest of you
on the tarmac.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.247
My assistant, Mickey, will make
sure you have the details.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.284
Lucas, KeKe.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.920
<i>Have a good day.</i>

12:10.730 --> 12:12.332
Long time, no see, Tariq.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.800
Yeah, I know.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.336
Last time I saw you,
Detective Whitman was still breathing.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.004
Well, he ain't a problem anymore.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.873
Everything he was doing
was off the clock.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.241
What he had died with him.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.809
Yeah, but what about 12?

12:22.809 --> 12:24.911
Sure they lookin' more closely
into you now.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.347
- Sure they didn't follow you here?
- I ain't stupid, nigga.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.117
- I'm just making sure you good.
- I'm always good.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.285
And I'm impatient.
What you got for me?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.356
A'ight.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.458
IG didn't lie to you, okay?

12:38.458 --> 12:40.794
He was in the Dominican Republic
the day Zeke got killed.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.963
- It wasn't him.
- Oh, fuck.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.499
Wait, how the fuck do you know that?
Are you sure?

12:45.499 --> 12:49.302
Let's just say the source doesn't get
more reliable than this.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.037
<i>IG didn't kill Zeke.</i>

12:55.809 --> 12:56.910
What's up, Ma?

12:56.910 --> 13:00.080
I had to run out on this poker game.
I'm tryna get this money.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.448
Why we meetin' in the truck?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.517
Who told you IG killed Zeke?

13:06.119 --> 13:08.155
What the fuck?
You bet your hearing in the game, boy?

13:08.155 --> 13:09.322
Answer me!

13:11.191 --> 13:12.192
Pops.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.029
Lorenzo told you IG killed Zeke?

13:17.397 --> 13:19.799
Well, what kind of proof he had?

13:19.799 --> 13:20.901
He said whoever attacked Dru

13:20.901 --> 13:23.336
was the same motherfucker
that killed Zeke.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.105
And you just believed him?

13:25.906 --> 13:28.041
Talkin' like it's some random nigga
on the street.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.509
This is Pops we talkin' about.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.045
I mean, we had a target on our back
for killing the Guaps,

13:32.045 --> 13:36.516
so it makes sense that one of them
would wanna kill Zeke.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.584
Right?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.388
- Of course.
- Right.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.372
RSJ.
- Hey.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.974
I wanted to thank you.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.609
You know, going as hard as you
did to get me on this trip,

14:02.842 --> 14:03.977
you didn't really have to do that.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.545
Appreciate it.
I kinda get the sense

14:05.545 --> 14:08.048
you aren't one of Lucas'
favorite interns.

14:08.048 --> 14:11.518
Let's just say he's still evaluating me
based on my past, you know?

14:11.518 --> 14:14.854
Mm, well, if I was judged
by who I was when I was 19,

14:14.854 --> 14:16.623
people wouldn't trust me today either.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.558
Mm. Growth is a real thing, huh?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.493
Mm-hmm.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.262
I wanted to flag something.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.630
My girlfriend's
robotics professor,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.899
he mentioned something
about Navona in class,

14:25.899 --> 14:27.500
and I thought that maybe
the information he shared

14:27.500 --> 14:28.568
might be helpful to you.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.539
Let me check in with the pilot.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.307
Then we can talk about it
when we take off, huh?

14:34.307 --> 14:35.909
Mm-hmm.

14:35.909 --> 14:36.977
- 'Sup, babe?
- What up?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.011
How are you?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.280
- How you feelin'? How you feelin'?
- I'm good.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.416
Um, I'm gonna knock out
so we're ready to party upon touchdown.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.618
I suggest you do the same.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.519
Okay, wait, Brayden.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.255
We're going to Milan to work.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.190
It's not an excuse
to go find a party.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.392
Yeah, no, I don't need
to find a party.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.494
The party finds me.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.396
This shit about to be a movie!

14:56.396 --> 14:57.631
Hey, wait. Brayden.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.299
<i>PJ!</i>

15:09.476 --> 15:12.145
Look at you cheesin' and shit.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.446
Lookin' all happy.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.448
- I am.
- You should be.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.451
Welcome. Welcome aboard.

15:44.377 --> 15:48.548
Monet Tejada's self-defense story
is fucking bullshit.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.351
She murdered a cop,
and we're not doing shit about it.

15:52.419 --> 15:55.588
Whitman was unhinged,
but he wasn't a criminal.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.190
This is on us.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.693
We should've fuckin' listened
to him.

15:59.693 --> 16:02.228
Ah, a lot of white hats go criminal

16:02.228 --> 16:05.498
when their boats are rocked
by a white whale.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.335
That sounds like some bullshit
your corrupt ass would come up with.

16:08.335 --> 16:12.072
Monet killed him
because he was onto something.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.540
Whatever he had...

16:14.474 --> 16:16.676
...it's gone now.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.179
Here's somethin'.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.751
The last known plug
of the Castillos' Brooklyn syndicate,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.252
this Russian, was found dead.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.590
Just a hunch, but I think the Tejadas
had something to do with it.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.659
So they could become
the Castillos' connect.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.128
Eh, that's a leap.

16:35.128 --> 16:38.565
We've spotted the Castillos' vehicles
outside the Tejadas' penthouse.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.034
Still a leap.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.335
Okay, the question is,

16:42.335 --> 16:45.538
who is supplying Tariq
and the Tejadas with drugs?

16:45.538 --> 16:47.607
Davis must know.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.642
Oh, sh--
he hasn't let anything slip.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.177
Come on!

16:51.177 --> 16:53.413
We are working off
of your consigliere theory, Saxe.

16:55.048 --> 16:58.218
Just give me something on Davis
I can use, please.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.022
Or how long before we all end up
like Whitman?

17:05.525 --> 17:06.726
To fuckin' Whitman.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.163
To fuckin' Whitman.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.203
- Love you
- Love you more.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.411
Mm.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.419
I think, um...

17:32.419 --> 17:34.187
I think Mom might know something.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.159
What makes you say that?

17:39.159 --> 17:42.095
I don't know how she found out,
but she know IG didn't do it.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.130
He was in DR
when Zeke was killed.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.368
Did she say
she thinks it was me?

17:48.368 --> 17:50.370
Nah. There's no way she could.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.738
I didn't say shit.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.341
Your mother never shows her hand, Cane.
You, of all people, should know that.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.578
You ever think about just telling her?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.447
I mean, this whole thing was
an accident, right?

18:00.447 --> 18:02.415
Yeah, it was.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.185
Okay. Okay.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.486
I can't.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.222
She'll never forgive me.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.825
Okay.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.726
But if she's figuring
this stuff out right now,

18:13.726 --> 18:16.362
I think it's best
if all this shit comes from you.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.631
You really think
that's gonna make a difference?

18:18.631 --> 18:20.333
I do.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.206
I don't.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.282
<i>♪ I'm not from around here ♪</i>

18:37.717 --> 18:40.119
<i>♪ But I'm not out of place ♪</i>

18:41.387 --> 18:45.191
<i>♪ I mix all up
In the atmosphere ♪</i>

18:45.191 --> 18:48.661
<i>♪ Up into outer space ♪</i>

18:48.661 --> 18:52.499
<i>♪ I'm a superhuman, baby ♪</i>

18:52.499 --> 18:54.300
No, no, no, no, no.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.402
No, no, no.
Fuck that phone, man.

18:56.402 --> 18:59.305
Just give me one second.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.378
Hey, what's wrong?

19:05.378 --> 19:07.247
Um, nothing, nothing.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.584
Something's going on.
Talk to me.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.655
You know those rednecks
that we shot?

19:16.789 --> 19:19.459
One of them is a CI
who's being medevacked

19:19.459 --> 19:22.495
to a hospital nearby,
so he's alive.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.531
I'm gonna handle it.

19:24.531 --> 19:28.368
The connect that you were locked up with
is a fucking CI,

19:28.368 --> 19:29.736
and you didn't know about it?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.204
Bro, fuck, no.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.172
And you expect me to believe that?

19:33.172 --> 19:36.242
Oh, come on, I know exactly what
people say about my family

19:36.242 --> 19:38.378
after what my pops did,
but I'm not a fucking snitch.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.913
Yeah, a'ight.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.715
Yo, you really think I would've gone
up there had I known this?

19:43.550 --> 19:47.453
Or that I would ever do anything
to hurt you or your family?

19:47.453 --> 19:50.890
Also, if I was a fucking snitch,
why would I tell you the truth, anyway?

19:57.764 --> 19:58.865
Fine.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.840
- What are we gon' do?
- No.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.875
My mess, my cleanup.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.711
If he's a CI,
he could take us all down.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.879
I'm in this.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.815
So what's the plan?

20:22.755 --> 20:24.357
<i>I'll be with you in a second.</i>

20:24.357 --> 20:25.625
<i>Sit anywhere.</i>

20:32.565 --> 20:33.566
Monet.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.406
I heard about what happened
with that cop at your house.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.708
You okay?

20:41.708 --> 20:43.309
I'm not here for that.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.985
What's going on?

20:51.985 --> 20:53.820
I seen a lot of people die.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.391
In our lives,
you get so used to losing people,

20:58.391 --> 21:00.693
you stop loving as hard so it hurts less.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.298
Losing Zeke, it was like...

21:05.298 --> 21:07.000
a part of me died, too.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.670
Why are you telling me this?

21:10.670 --> 21:12.505
'Cause I been thinking about you.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.676
This is how you must've felt
when Frank went missing.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.814
It's true.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.992
I just wish I knew
what happened to him, you know?

21:32.992 --> 21:34.894
I mean, it would give me some peace.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.867
I know what happened.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.071
That's not what you said before.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.341
I know, but I think
you deserve to know the truth.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.680
Lorenzo put a hit out on Frank
when he found out he snitched.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.025
Are you trying
to clear your conscience?

22:06.025 --> 22:08.428
I figured
you'd find out eventually.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.729
Look, I already lost one child.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.732
I didn't want this
to come back on the others.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.467
I thought you should know
who's responsible.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.603
Uh-uh. I know you.

22:17.603 --> 22:20.873
You just gave me
a very valuable piece of capital,

22:20.873 --> 22:22.842
enough to change your family forever.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.043
Why?

22:24.043 --> 22:27.013
My family's been changed
forever already, Evelyn.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.917
I cannot stop you
from doing what you have to do.

22:32.118 --> 22:36.122
What would happen if your sons found out
that me or one of my kids hurt Lorenzo?

22:37.090 --> 22:39.859
Look, I know the consequences
of me telling you this.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.896
But after Zeke...

22:43.896 --> 22:46.099
I just couldn't sit with this anymore.

22:57.744 --> 23:00.513
I loved Frank.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.615
But I love my boys even more.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.619
I can't risk losing one of them
for the sake of revenge.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.121
Your choice.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.492
But do you think
you can live with it?

23:13.059 --> 23:14.627
I think I'll have to.

23:16.662 --> 23:19.432
You're more forgiving than me.

23:22.435 --> 23:25.071
Regardless of the outcome,

23:25.071 --> 23:28.441
I don't want anyone to know
we had this conversation.

23:28.441 --> 23:29.642
Can I trust you?

23:33.913 --> 23:36.516
As much as I can trust you.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.533
What you've built here
is amazing.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.501
<i>There's no denying that.</i>

23:55.501 --> 23:59.105
But in order to expand, you're gonna need
a significant investment,

23:59.105 --> 24:01.440
and that's what we're offering.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.775
You've seen
what we've been able to do

24:02.775 --> 24:04.911
with other tech companies
in our portfolio.

24:05.545 --> 24:09.448
In order to give anyone 10%,

24:09.448 --> 24:13.019
we are going to need
the, eh, interest and commitment

24:13.019 --> 24:16.856
to be proven in a language
we all can understand.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.459
- Cash.
- Exactly.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.228
What is that expression?

24:27.567 --> 24:30.069
She basically just said,
"Put your money where your mouth is."

24:30.069 --> 24:32.839
Ah. We're willing.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.874
But first,
we're gonna need to address

24:34.874 --> 24:36.475
something you've been hiding.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.246
We haven't been hiding anything.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.548
Really?

24:42.548 --> 24:46.018
Our sources say that despite
your efforts to keep it quiet,

24:46.018 --> 24:47.220
you've been having some issues

24:47.220 --> 24:49.722
with the U.S. patent
of your debut product.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.090
You know,

24:51.090 --> 24:53.125
the one that caught
Weston Holdings' attention

24:53.125 --> 24:54.493
in the first place.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.496
And, you know,
per my research and assessment,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.031
without the patent,
the company isn't worth

24:59.031 --> 25:00.800
the gas it took
for us to jet over here.

25:02.568 --> 25:04.871
Now, with my connections
in the States,

25:04.871 --> 25:06.672
the patent issues go away.

25:06.672 --> 25:07.740
Pronto.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.976
That's Italian, right? Pronto?

25:09.976 --> 25:12.745
<i>Legitimizing Navona
in the field</i>

25:12.745 --> 25:14.247
<i>and boosting stock value.</i>

25:14.247 --> 25:15.681
See, an act like that sounds

25:15.681 --> 25:17.917
like a little more
than an investment to me.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.685
Sounds like a partnership, right?

25:19.685 --> 25:22.555
Agreed.
More like, uh, 20% ownership

25:22.555 --> 25:25.791
with a significant reduction
in the cash offer.

25:26.759 --> 25:27.994
<i>You know,</i>

25:27.994 --> 25:31.030
before your patent problems
begin to get out there.

25:34.066 --> 25:38.004
You have until the end of business today
to accept our offer.

25:38.804 --> 25:41.173
I can make these patent issues
go away by Monday.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.245
Thank you very much.

25:56.289 --> 25:57.957
We'll have
to get to the snitch...

25:57.957 --> 26:00.126
Before he can identify
any of us to the Feds, I know.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.597
Oh, fuck.
Might be too late.

26:04.597 --> 26:05.932
Shit. Come on, come on.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.105
<i>Code blue in room 319.</i>

26:13.105 --> 26:15.141
<i>Code blue, room 319.
Excuse me.</i>

26:15.141 --> 26:16.242
Step aside.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.344
I'm sorry,
coming through.

26:21.314 --> 26:23.916
Shit, them Navona motherfuckers,
they tried to lowball us.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.785
When we brought up
their little patent issue,

26:25.785 --> 26:27.620
you should've seen they face.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.822
- Appreciate you on the assist.
- Of course.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.190
Just make sure you break me off
a little something

26:31.190 --> 26:32.725
when them millions start
rolling in, okay?

26:32.725 --> 26:34.260
Come on, you know
I'ma break bread with my boo.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.263
You know that.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.365
I cannot believe
that we're in Italy.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.300
- Right?
- It's just crazy we had to come

26:41.300 --> 26:43.736
all the way out here
to get our first date.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.638
- First date?
- Yes.

26:45.638 --> 26:48.140
Well, I mean, you know,
with so much shit going on back at home,

26:48.140 --> 26:50.943
it's like we have no time
to even breathe.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.079
Between holding down school
and the business,

26:53.079 --> 26:55.681
I don't even remember
what breathing is like.

26:55.681 --> 26:57.883
I mean, you handle this shit
pretty well, though.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.019
I'm not gonna lie,
I kind of love this shit, too,

27:00.019 --> 27:01.654
especially having you by my side.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.089
It's pretty fun.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.859
Surely our date
doesn't end here, though.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.730
You know what shoes you're wearing
to the Teatro alla Scala tonight?

27:10.730 --> 27:11.831
Oh.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.099
You from here?

27:13.099 --> 27:15.067
Sounded all perfect saying that shit.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.069
But I was thinking
maybe the Ferragamos.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.138
Mm!
- You know, when in Italia.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.307
Gotta figure out what designer
dress I'm gonna throw on.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.010
Mm, I'm not sure.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.845
Got so many.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.213
But I was thinking, baby,

27:27.213 --> 27:30.249
you know, we've been
to the opera so many times.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.418
You know, I think it's time
for us to maybe ditch it,

27:32.651 --> 27:34.053
stay home,
and cook some dinner.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.788
Whoa.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.090
Whoa.
What?

27:38.090 --> 27:39.425
You can make up
anything you want,

27:39.658 --> 27:41.394
and you pick some corny shit
like cooking with me?

27:41.394 --> 27:44.063
Wait, wait, how is cooking
with my girlfriend corny?

27:44.063 --> 27:45.097
How is that corny?

27:45.097 --> 27:48.034
I think all that normal shit
is honestly the best.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.669
You know, we go to the market,
grocery shop.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.038
We come home, chef it up,

27:52.038 --> 27:54.373
and then we argue about what show
we're gonna binge next, no?

27:54.373 --> 27:57.043
- That doesn't sound boring to you?
- Hell, no.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.111
Listen...

27:59.111 --> 28:00.913
spending time not having to worry

28:00.913 --> 28:03.082
about shit that's going on
in this crazy world

28:03.082 --> 28:04.750
with the girl that I love?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.252
Sounds amazing to me.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.823
Is this future Tariq talking?

28:10.823 --> 28:11.857
Nah.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.426
It's just me right now.

28:13.426 --> 28:16.395
Promising that we're not gonna
have to hold our breath forever.

28:16.395 --> 28:20.433
We're gonna get the fuck outta this shit
and live a real life, together.

28:20.433 --> 28:21.700
How that sound?

28:27.339 --> 28:29.175
Well...

28:29.175 --> 28:31.410
Fancy running into you two.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.412
- You come here often?
- What the hell are y'all doing here?

28:33.412 --> 28:35.981
Well, that's just rude.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.884
Not the greeting we expected at all.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.921
I was surprised to hear that two
of my favorite contract employees

28:41.921 --> 28:44.490
were hopping on a private plane to Milan.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.959
But I'm sure you can imagine
how my attention was piqued

28:46.959 --> 28:49.028
when I found out
who the jet belonged to.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.429
Well, you have nothing
to worry about,

28:50.429 --> 28:52.832
being that RSJ knows nothing
about our business.

28:52.832 --> 28:55.267
And that's exactly
why I've come to see you.

28:55.267 --> 28:58.404
I need you to handle something for me
while you're here.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.340
I need you to retrieve a listening device
planted by Mecca.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.410
Who is no longer with us to retrieve it.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.145
BTW...

29:07.279 --> 29:10.149
...the police have not made any arrests
regarding his murder.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.320
You two haven't heard anything,
have you?

29:14.320 --> 29:17.056
Nothing. Nothing at all.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.924
Now tell us about this--this bug.

29:18.924 --> 29:21.427
Can't you just intercept it
and get the audio file?

29:21.427 --> 29:24.497
- I can find a way to transmit it.
- Not where it's located.

29:24.497 --> 29:25.898
Where is it?

29:25.898 --> 29:28.434
Francesco Lombardi's mansion.

29:28.434 --> 29:31.504
Now, to most of Europe, he's an oil giant,

29:31.504 --> 29:34.440
but he's one
of my biggest arms competitors.

29:34.440 --> 29:38.344
And my ex, who stole clients from me
after I kicked his ass to the curb.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.446
Sounds a little personal.
Oh, it is.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.948
So you know how important it is
that you succeed, right?

29:43.849 --> 29:46.352
A'ight, where do we get this shit?
How do we get in?

29:46.352 --> 29:50.523
He hosts these weekly salons
where the invites are exclusive

29:50.523 --> 29:52.391
and the attendees are
all one-percenters.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.227
It's... obnoxious.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.930
My people can't get
within a mile of the place.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.165
But you know who can?

30:00.032 --> 30:01.033
RSJ.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.102
Mm, I told you
he wasn't stupid.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.273
I'll leave the how up to you.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.474
But you need to get it to me

30:08.474 --> 30:11.343
without Francesco finding out
it ever existed.

30:11.343 --> 30:14.213
Understood?

30:14.213 --> 30:15.848
- Yes.
- Yes.

30:16.482 --> 30:20.486
You'll have no problems getting RSJ
and his guests on the list.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.987
Good luck,

30:21.987 --> 30:26.058
because if you fail, there are,
as always, consequences.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.945
They did everything they could,
but he didn't make it.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.013
<i>Fuck. I needed him.</i>

30:48.013 --> 30:50.015
We stripped off his phone and wallet
when he was brought in.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.383
You can collect at the floor desk.

30:51.383 --> 30:54.019

I'm glad you convinced me
to come out tonight, Tariq.

32:40.225 --> 32:43.495
This place is even more
impressive than the rumors.

32:43.495 --> 32:46.465
Beautiful, huh?
Yeah. It really is.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.473
Hey.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.009
<i>That's Francesco Lombardi.</i>

32:57.009 --> 32:58.377
<i>It's one of the few places
in Europe</i>

32:58.377 --> 33:00.245
where you're gonna find
Leonardo Del Vecchio

33:00.245 --> 33:02.247
hanging out
with Victoria Beckham.

33:03.582 --> 33:04.683
Good call.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.387
I've been impressed with you, Tariq.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.623
I-I'd be lying if I said

33:11.623 --> 33:13.625
I wasn't familiar with your story.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.527
Your father.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.429
I never really knew my father.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.232
Sounds like he had
at least two faces.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.701
One public, one private.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.603
Well, isn't everybody
like that?

33:27.639 --> 33:29.408
My father?

33:29.408 --> 33:30.709
He ran numbers.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.578
He was a petty criminal.

33:32.578 --> 33:35.781
Everybody told me
I was gonna end up like him.

33:36.014 --> 33:39.218
But I didn't let
their expectations box me in.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.753
I chose my own route.

33:42.087 --> 33:44.289
I hope you do the same.

33:59.104 --> 34:00.272
What the fuck?

34:00.773 --> 34:02.341
It could be fucking anywhere.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.743
It's gotta be under something,
somewhere he wouldn't normally look.

34:04.743 --> 34:07.479
Obi said this is where Lombardi
takes his private meetings.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.047
What the fuck?

34:18.123 --> 34:19.758
Oh, bingo.

34:19.758 --> 34:21.059
Hurry up.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.761
<i>Oh, I'm the fucking man.</i>

34:28.801 --> 34:30.803
What are you doing?

34:31.637 --> 34:33.605
You're not allowed to be up here.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.374
I, um...

34:35.374 --> 34:37.276
Why are you in here?

34:37.276 --> 34:38.777
Um, I, um...

34:39.812 --> 34:41.847
Good, thank you?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.749
Ah! Okay, fuck! Ah!

34:45.217 --> 34:47.352
Hey, chill the fuck out! Ah!

34:55.494 --> 34:57.296
Ah, fuck.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.188
Guests aren't allowed up here.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.125
Well, I won't tell
if you won't.

35:28.527 --> 35:31.263
This art is incredible,
isn't it?

35:31.263 --> 35:32.664
I was up here snooping around

35:32.664 --> 35:35.200
looking for Lombardi's
private art collection.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.603
I hear it's amazing.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.371
First time here?

35:40.539 --> 35:41.840
What gave it away?

35:42.708 --> 35:44.510
Hmm.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.379
His, uh, private collection
is this way.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.588
I'm glad to have you back, Di.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.390
I am happy to be here.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.592
Even happier to smell
<i>papi's</i> cooking again.

36:02.194 --> 36:05.497
Well, I know how much
your mother loves my sancocho.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.833
And it's cold outside.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.935
Perfect for it, right, Mo?

36:13.338 --> 36:15.674
You know what sancocho
reminds me of?

36:17.509 --> 36:19.411
Remember when we'd go
to G- <i>mami's</i> in Puerto Rico,

36:19.411 --> 36:22.614
play spades, and the losers
would have to serve everybody?

36:22.614 --> 36:23.882
No, I don't remember that,

36:23.882 --> 36:25.918
'cause I think me and my partner
never lost a game.

36:25.918 --> 36:26.952
I know that's right.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.487
Wow.
<i>Wow.</i>

36:28.487 --> 36:30.622
See, that shoulder injury
done went to your brain.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.524
Oh!
Oh! Yeah.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.759
You need me to jog your memory?
What's up?

36:33.759 --> 36:35.861
I do, and if you need me
to teach you something

36:35.861 --> 36:37.829
about how to play spades, dog...

36:37.829 --> 36:40.365
D. Come help me in the kitchen.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.701
<i>You can't beat me
in no spades, in nothing.</i>

36:42.701 --> 36:44.202
<i>I beat you at everything, bro.</i>

36:44.202 --> 36:45.237
Okay.
<i>It's real.</i>

36:45.237 --> 36:46.672
I hear you, Dr. Smartass.

36:46.672 --> 36:48.373
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:54.479 --> 36:55.647
You all right?

36:55.647 --> 36:57.583
I'm fine.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.985
I just don't have
the memories they have.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.488
All of my childhood memories of you
are visiting Sing Sing.

37:03.488 --> 37:06.458
Well, we're making up
for those memories right now.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.492
Are we?

37:07.492 --> 37:08.994
Because I feel like this is the first time

37:09.227 --> 37:12.230
we've talked about something
outside of the business in a long time,

37:12.230 --> 37:15.500
which, by the way,
is drawing a little too much attention

37:15.500 --> 37:16.802
from my manager at work.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.606
I'm sorry, <i>mamita.</i>

37:20.606 --> 37:22.374
I dragged you back into this

37:22.374 --> 37:23.976
just when you were getting
your taste of freedom.

37:23.976 --> 37:25.477
That's on me.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.613
I know what that's like.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.581
- You do?
- Yeah.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.817
You think I grew up
wanting to sell drugs?

37:32.918 --> 37:35.020
Baseball.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.255
- That was my game.
- Uh-uh.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.924
And I was nasty, too.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.559
What happened?

37:42.661 --> 37:44.029
Wasn't in the cards.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.667
Let's pull the plug.

37:49.668 --> 37:50.969
You're done.

37:50.969 --> 37:54.272
I'm gonna work something out with Cane
to go sell somewhere else.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.509
You're gonna be the first person
in this family to get a college degree,

37:57.509 --> 38:00.012
and I don't want you focusing
on anything else.

38:00.012 --> 38:02.047
Seriously?

38:03.315 --> 38:05.384
Thank you, <i>papi!</i>

38:10.989 --> 38:13.058
Okay, this is all
a big misunderstanding.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.693
I'm just here for the party!

38:15.827 --> 38:18.764
Weston? Brayden Weston?

38:18.764 --> 38:20.832
You can contact my family
if it's money you're after.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.634
Money's no problem, I swear.

38:22.634 --> 38:27.372
Yes, Mr. Weston.
We've done our research.

38:27.372 --> 38:29.574
Standard practice for anybody
who enters my home.

38:29.574 --> 38:33.045
Okay, perfect. Then you know
that I have no reason to steal from you.

38:33.045 --> 38:35.981
Only a few months ago...

38:35.981 --> 38:39.751
you were making headlines
as a drug dealer in New York,

38:39.751 --> 38:43.488
and now I find you spying

38:43.488 --> 38:44.990
in my library.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.692
<i>What should I make of that?</i>

38:46.692 --> 38:48.760
You have it all wrong.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.398
Who do you work for?

38:59.404 --> 39:00.739
No, no, no, no.
Come on. Come on, man.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.542
No, no, no.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.050
I didn't see where they took him.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.119
Why the fuck isn't he answering, yo?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.855
Because they took him!

39:18.890 --> 39:20.926
Who the fuck could that be?

39:26.865 --> 39:29.067
Hey, uh, is Brayden in here with you?

39:29.067 --> 39:31.837
Uh, no.
He's at the Lombardi mansion still.

39:32.738 --> 39:36.408
You got back over an hour ago.
He shouldn't still be there.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.410
Well, that's where we left him.

39:38.410 --> 39:42.447
You know, I'm sure he'll be back
during appropriate coworker social hours.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.117
Yeah. I'm sure he will.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.653
I will see you three
in the lobby tomorrow?

39:48.653 --> 39:50.122
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:50.122 --> 39:51.156
Okay.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.161
What the fuck are we gonna do?

40:00.031 --> 40:03.635
Look, we're gonna have to use the only
leverage we have against Lombardi.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.062
Oh, hey, what's up, Auntie?

40:31.062 --> 40:32.497
Hey, Gordo.

40:32.497 --> 40:34.199
Damn, ain't you cold?

40:35.867 --> 40:37.602
This is keeping me warm.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.571
My favorite kind of jacket.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.142
Hey, um...

40:44.142 --> 40:46.511
I'm sorry about missing
Zeke's funeral.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.147
I wanted to say it sooner,

40:49.147 --> 40:51.683
but this is the first time
I got you alone, so...

40:52.751 --> 40:54.119
I hope it's not too late.

40:58.657 --> 40:59.891
I know shit
got way worse for me

40:59.891 --> 41:01.960
those first few months
after losing my father.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.664
I didn't think it could get
any worse, but...

41:05.664 --> 41:06.965
somehow it does.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.534
You here for Dru?

41:11.236 --> 41:12.971
You be careful with my son.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.706
Or else, right?

41:14.706 --> 41:16.808
Damn right.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.176
I got you.

41:20.545 --> 41:22.080
When did it start
getting better?

41:24.149 --> 41:25.517
The grief.

41:28.887 --> 41:29.988
I don't know.

41:32.724 --> 41:35.927
It gets diluted,
but it's-it's always there.

41:37.062 --> 41:38.196
And the anger?

41:39.731 --> 41:41.132
Does it ever go away?

41:41.132 --> 41:42.901
For me?

41:43.802 --> 41:44.803
Nah.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.906
If I had the chance...

41:49.641 --> 41:52.677
...I'd slit the throat of the motherfucker
who killed my father.

41:54.045 --> 41:55.146
Me too.

41:57.082 --> 41:58.617
For Zeke.

42:24.109 --> 42:25.911
Yo.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.216
Take a look at that.

42:31.216 --> 42:34.185
<i>I found a constitutional violation</i>

42:34.185 --> 42:36.655
in the unredacted Theo Rollins case file.

42:36.655 --> 42:38.089
We could file a writ of habeas corpus.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.891
We might be able
to get Theo out of prison.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.126
Seriously?

42:41.126 --> 42:43.194
Prosecution misstepped.

42:45.864 --> 42:48.633
This might be the closest
we've ever gotten.

42:51.202 --> 42:54.105
I knew keeping you around
would pay off.

42:54.105 --> 42:55.307
You know what?

42:57.676 --> 42:58.677
Come on.

43:03.148 --> 43:06.051
Let's go see Theo,
tell him in person.

43:06.051 --> 43:08.086
- Oh.
- All right, yeah.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.821
So cool, so cool.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.323
Hey, you know what?
I-I shouldn't go.

43:11.323 --> 43:13.258
I gotta work on the brief.

43:13.258 --> 43:14.826
You don't want to be there
when I tell him?

43:14.826 --> 43:16.194
This is your moment.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.897
And he's not going anywhere
till I file the paperwork.

43:18.897 --> 43:21.733
Well, get on it, bruh.

43:41.386 --> 43:44.055
Motherfucker.

43:45.857 --> 43:47.292
Ah.

43:57.369 --> 43:59.004
Davis.

43:59.004 --> 44:01.006
Where the fuck did you get this?

44:09.314 --> 44:10.882
Motherfucker.

45:15.246 --> 45:17.449
You have what you promised?

45:17.449 --> 45:18.783
Yes.

45:18.783 --> 45:20.085
Recordings of you and your clients

45:20.085 --> 45:23.088
talking about arms deals,
drug deals, all of the above.

45:23.088 --> 45:24.722
I'm sure you want
to keep it confidential,

45:24.722 --> 45:27.292
but if you want this back,
I'ma need my friend first.

45:33.465 --> 45:35.800
You good, B?

45:36.968 --> 45:38.303
Are you okay?

45:38.303 --> 45:39.337
No.

45:44.142 --> 45:45.276
What the fuck?

45:47.278 --> 45:49.147
Who do you work for?

45:49.147 --> 45:51.182
Do you work for Mecca?

45:51.182 --> 45:52.484
Is that bastard alive?

45:52.484 --> 45:54.385
No.
Tell me!

45:56.421 --> 45:58.790
And I'll let them live.

45:58.790 --> 46:00.125
Tell me!

46:08.466 --> 46:09.534
What the fuck?

46:09.767 --> 46:10.935
What the fuck took y'all so long?

46:10.935 --> 46:12.971
We called you
so we wouldn't get shot.

46:12.971 --> 46:14.906
That's how you
express gratitude?

46:14.906 --> 46:17.408
Americans. So simple.

46:17.408 --> 46:18.810
Calm down.

46:18.810 --> 46:20.345
We weren't gonna let them
hurt you.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.947
We so appreciated your call.

46:22.947 --> 46:26.284
Luring Francesco out here
so I could eliminate him was genius,

46:26.284 --> 46:27.919
so thank you.

46:35.527 --> 46:37.829
And I'll take
the listening device.

46:48.873 --> 46:51.476
You're more clever
than I gave you credit for.

46:51.476 --> 46:55.079
That trial period I mentioned,
consider it complete.

46:56.047 --> 46:58.416
Now that I'll be taking over
Francesco's business,

46:58.416 --> 47:00.018
there'll be more work
for everyone.

47:00.885 --> 47:04.088
I think your team has a bright
and long future with me.

47:23.374 --> 47:26.477
<i>You've reached Jenny Sullivan.
Leave a message.</i>

47:35.386 --> 47:37.589
Where are you going, Jenny?

47:55.106 --> 47:56.307
'Riq.

47:56.307 --> 47:58.276
We're making it
outta Italy alive.

47:58.276 --> 48:00.545
Let's just take the fucking victory.
I can't, all right?

48:00.545 --> 48:02.247
Noma still owns us forever.

48:03.114 --> 48:05.250
Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure.

48:06.451 --> 48:07.585
May have a way out.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.320
How?

48:10.355 --> 48:12.290
She's our way out.

48:13.424 --> 48:16.461
One of the scariest things about Noma
was that she was this enigma.

48:16.461 --> 48:19.430
Took this picture getting a tour
of Lombardi's private art collection.

48:20.198 --> 48:22.033
Noma said that Lombardi
was her ex, right?

48:22.033 --> 48:25.970
If this is her kid,
this is her Achilles' heel.

48:25.970 --> 48:28.406
We find the girl, we can use her
to leverage our freedom.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.074
Yo, if you're right,
then that means the same man

48:30.074 --> 48:33.211
that Noma just fucking executed
is the father of her daughter.

48:33.211 --> 48:34.979
Yeah, what about it?

48:34.979 --> 48:36.347
What the fuck do you mean
what about it?

48:36.347 --> 48:38.950
Effie, the bitch is a savage.
We need to be careful, all right?

48:40.285 --> 48:41.552
Yeah.
<i>Car's here.</i>

48:41.552 --> 48:42.920
Y'all ready?

48:42.920 --> 48:45.189
Yeah. Let's do it.

49:00.171 --> 49:01.939
What's wrong, Mo?

49:01.939 --> 49:03.941
I just think
it's fucking ridiculous

49:03.941 --> 49:05.610
that the Feds were so quick

49:05.610 --> 49:07.345
to investigate
the Whitman murder,

49:07.345 --> 49:09.514
running through our house,
asking Diana questions,

49:09.514 --> 49:11.582
but when it came to Zeke,

49:11.582 --> 49:14.352
they chalked it up
as gang activity and moved on.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.367
I need to tell you something.

49:30.335 --> 49:32.203
I-I need you to look at me.

49:35.573 --> 49:37.241
I made a horrible mistake.

49:38.643 --> 49:40.278
What mistake?

49:41.979 --> 49:43.514
That night...

49:43.514 --> 49:46.351
I went to go see Mecca
at the hangar.

49:47.218 --> 49:49.520
You weren't supposed to be
at that hangar.

49:49.520 --> 49:50.688
I know.

49:50.688 --> 49:52.223
But you didn't show up.

49:53.758 --> 49:55.493
I thought Mecca
might've taken you.

49:56.627 --> 49:58.062
You didn't trust me.

49:58.996 --> 50:00.431
You thought I was gonna go away
with this nigga?

50:00.431 --> 50:01.466
No.

50:03.434 --> 50:05.103
Maybe. Maybe.

50:05.103 --> 50:07.672
I just--I wanted to kill
that motherfucker.

50:07.672 --> 50:10.708
I wasn't gonna stand for what
that man did to my family,

50:10.708 --> 50:12.076
to our life.

50:13.511 --> 50:15.380
I thought I was shootin' him.

50:24.756 --> 50:26.424
But it was Zeke.

50:27.425 --> 50:29.193
It was fuckin' Zeke.

50:31.763 --> 50:34.665
I never meant
to hurt your son, Mo.

50:34.665 --> 50:36.601
It was a fucking accident.

50:39.337 --> 50:41.339
Accident?

50:41.339 --> 50:43.574
You know what wasn't
a fuckin' accident?

50:43.574 --> 50:46.577
All the fuckin' months it took you
to fuckin' tell me this shit.

50:46.577 --> 50:49.180
You watched me
lose my fuckin' mind, lose myself.

50:49.180 --> 50:51.282
I couldn't eat.
I couldn't fuckin' sleep!

50:51.282 --> 50:54.619
You watched me kill IG
knowin' it was you the whole fuckin' time!

50:57.088 --> 50:58.790
You brought Zeke here.

51:00.124 --> 51:03.394
Y-you--you put him
in the middle of this life.

51:03.394 --> 51:05.496
And you didn't prepare him.

51:05.496 --> 51:09.066
And then you fucked Dante,
and you let him back into our lives!

51:09.066 --> 51:11.469
Oh, you motherfucker!
You tryna put this shit on me?

51:11.469 --> 51:14.539
I'm saying it's on you
as much as it is on me!

51:18.643 --> 51:22.513
Mo, I made a terrible mistake.

51:22.513 --> 51:24.215
We both have.

51:24.215 --> 51:27.618
But if you love me, you can--
you can forgive me.

51:27.618 --> 51:28.820
Love you?

51:29.687 --> 51:31.656
I fuckin' hate you.

51:31.656 --> 51:34.292
You killed all of that
when you shot my son.

51:34.292 --> 51:35.626
I can't even
fuckin' look at you.

51:35.626 --> 51:36.761
Mo.

51:38.162 --> 51:39.697
What about what we built?

51:41.132 --> 51:42.800
What about our family?

51:44.302 --> 51:46.170
Our kids, Mo?

51:47.605 --> 51:51.476
Out of respect for them, I'm not gonna
give you the bullet you deserve.

51:51.476 --> 51:53.744
But you need to get
the hell out of my house

51:53.744 --> 51:55.480
and get the fuck outta New York.

51:55.480 --> 51:56.581
Mo, please.

51:56.581 --> 51:58.282
No, we'll tell them we're separating.

51:59.217 --> 52:01.352
But I want your shit
outta my house tonight.

52:01.352 --> 52:02.420
Hold on--

52:02.420 --> 52:04.722
No, I'm so fuckin' done with your ass.
Get the fuck outta here.

52:06.457 --> 52:08.726
Go!

52:08.726 --> 52:09.760
Mo.

52:09.760 --> 52:12.230
Get the fuck outta here!

53:08.419 --> 53:09.520
Hey.

53:12.256 --> 53:14.926
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I-I-I'm here for Jenny Sullivan.

53:14.926 --> 53:16.727
Official business.

53:16.727 --> 53:18.763
- ID.
- Ah.

53:20.565 --> 53:22.800
Dang it.
I think I, uh, left it in the car.

53:22.800 --> 53:23.935
But she-she knows me.

53:23.935 --> 53:25.970
- If you just let me--
- Can't do that.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.872
Come on.
This is ridiculous.

53:27.872 --> 53:29.907
I'm-I'm here on behalf
of the DA's office.

53:29.907 --> 53:30.942
Saxe?

53:32.243 --> 53:33.544
What are you doing here?

53:33.544 --> 53:34.812
Just one second.

53:34.812 --> 53:36.647
Did you follow me?

53:38.983 --> 53:40.818
What the hell is all this, Jenny?

53:40.818 --> 53:42.720
- What are you hiding?
- Hiding?

53:42.720 --> 53:45.990
Please tell me you did not follow me
all the way here because you're jealous.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.759
You've been ignoring my calls and texts.

53:48.759 --> 53:51.362
What the hell is going on?
You have guards standing watch?

53:51.362 --> 53:54.732
- Who the fuck is in there?
- This is insane, even for you.

53:56.634 --> 53:59.503
I have been open and honest
this entire time.

53:59.503 --> 54:01.405
Oh.

54:01.405 --> 54:04.542
Hey, I'm risking my legal career
to go along with your theory

54:04.542 --> 54:06.711
that Tariq plotted
to have Lauren Baldwin killed,

54:06.711 --> 54:08.512
when I know he didn't do it!

54:08.512 --> 54:10.648
So, if you don't tell me
what the fuck is going on...

54:12.817 --> 54:13.884
...we're done.

54:15.886 --> 54:19.256
Or I can have you removed,
whichever you prefer.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.324
Wow.

54:23.661 --> 54:25.529
What was this for you, hmm?

54:25.529 --> 54:27.365
Did you feel anything?

54:27.365 --> 54:29.033
'Cause I did.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.902
Were you just using me
the way you used Lauren?

54:31.902 --> 54:33.537
I'm not sorry for anything,

54:33.537 --> 54:36.440
because when I'm done,
several killers will be in prison,

54:36.440 --> 54:38.009
and their fucking drugs
will be off the street.

54:38.009 --> 54:40.578
Isn't that our goal?
Isn't that what you want?

54:40.578 --> 54:43.781
If we're on the same team,
then what the fuck was all this about?

54:43.781 --> 54:46.450
Who's in there?
Why'd you keep this shit from me?

54:55.393 --> 54:56.994
Lauren.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.698
Unbelievable.

55:01.766 --> 55:03.768
You let me believe
she was dead.

55:05.536 --> 55:08.472
You--you betrayed me.

55:08.472 --> 55:09.974
You manipulated me.

55:09.974 --> 55:11.709
You manipulated her.

55:15.413 --> 55:16.547
I'm done.

55:17.448 --> 55:19.517
Wait, is what he's saying true?

55:19.517 --> 55:20.751
You lied to me, too?

55:20.751 --> 55:22.987
Just go back inside,
and I'll explain everything, okay?

55:22.987 --> 55:25.823
No. No, I want the truth now.

55:25.823 --> 55:27.625
He just said he doesn't think
Tariq tried to kill me,

55:27.625 --> 55:29.727
and I told you all along
it was Effie.

55:29.727 --> 55:32.930
And Brayden and Tariq
and the Tejadas.

55:32.930 --> 55:34.865
You know, she can't legally keep you here.

55:34.865 --> 55:35.966
Oh, come--

55:35.966 --> 55:37.802
I saw how he reacted when you died.

55:37.802 --> 55:40.438
Tariq didn't try to kill you.
He loved you.

55:43.908 --> 55:45.076
Lauren--

55:47.578 --> 55:48.913
Lauren!

55:50.648 --> 55:52.049
Everything's all ready.

55:52.049 --> 55:54.618
I'm just waiting on <i>papi</i> to get here,
unless y'all two want to partner up.

55:54.618 --> 55:56.721
Nah.
I don't play spades with anyone

55:56.721 --> 55:58.055
with less than five years' experience.

55:58.055 --> 55:59.090
I'm sorry, D.

55:59.090 --> 56:01.425
Ah! Yo.

56:01.425 --> 56:02.660
Y'all gonna lose regardless.

56:02.660 --> 56:03.961
<i>Exactly.</i>

56:03.961 --> 56:06.063
And <i>papi</i> said he would teach me
before we start.

56:06.063 --> 56:07.832
- Bet.
- Where is he?

56:08.599 --> 56:10.101
I don't know.
He must be running late.

56:10.101 --> 56:13.370
When he gets here, we need to talk
to you guys about something.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.441
Okay.

56:40.865 --> 56:42.633
What the fuck? Ma?

57:04.455 --> 57:06.157
Lauren, what the fuck?

57:07.725 --> 57:08.859
What the fuck are you doing?

57:08.859 --> 57:10.427
How are you here?
What the fuck is going on?

57:10.427 --> 57:12.897
Look, I came here
to ask you the same thing.

57:12.897 --> 57:14.632
Why did you do it, Tariq?

57:14.632 --> 57:16.500
- Why did you want me dead?
- Want you dead?

57:16.500 --> 57:17.802
What the fuck
are you talking about?

57:17.802 --> 57:19.837
You know, I don't know who
or what to believe anymore.

57:19.837 --> 57:21.872
Did you tell Brayden
to give me to her?

57:21.872 --> 57:22.907
You told her to kill me?

57:22.907 --> 57:24.809
Who? Who? Lauren, who the fuck
are you talking about?

57:24.809 --> 57:26.811
Your girlfriend, Effie.

57:26.811 --> 57:28.145
She took me from Brayden,

57:28.145 --> 57:30.648
knocked me out, and dumped me
in a fucking river.

57:30.648 --> 57:32.650
Oh, fuck.

57:32.650 --> 57:33.851
Look, I had n--

57:36.620 --> 57:38.823
I had no idea
about any of that, all right?

57:38.823 --> 57:41.859
- And how am I supposed to believe you?
- Because I care about you, Lauren.

57:42.893 --> 57:45.162
All right, why do you think
I sent you with Brayden?

57:45.162 --> 57:47.531
To get the fuck away from here,
to get away from this shit,

57:47.531 --> 57:48.799
to save you.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.936
Come on, you know I'd never do anything
to hurt you.

57:52.770 --> 57:54.705
Look, they fucking lied to me.

57:57.708 --> 57:59.143
Fuck this shit.
I need to go talk to--

57:59.143 --> 58:01.779
No, you don't, okay?

58:01.779 --> 58:02.947
They can't know I'm alive.

58:03.714 --> 58:05.516
Well, you have to believe me.

58:06.650 --> 58:08.719
Okay?
If I would've known you was--

58:09.987 --> 58:11.889
Lauren, where the fuck
have you been?

58:13.023 --> 58:14.725
I've been with the Feds.

58:15.793 --> 58:17.828
And they're building
a case against you.

58:19.730 --> 58:21.232
And you're their witness.

58:22.499 --> 58:26.570
If what you're saying is true,
me and the Feds,

58:26.570 --> 58:29.039
we're not the only people
you gotta worry about.

58:36.981 --> 58:38.082
Hey.

58:39.250 --> 58:40.584
You okay?

58:41.619 --> 58:44.088
Yeah, I just went for a walk.

58:45.222 --> 58:47.258
Time difference
got me fucked up.

58:50.828 --> 58:53.030
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you,

58:53.030 --> 58:56.600
but I feel like stuff has kinda
been getting in the way.

58:57.668 --> 58:58.936
What's up?

59:11.248 --> 59:12.783
I love you, too.

59:33.170 --> 59:34.705
Damn it!

1:00:38.402 --> 1:00:39.937
<i>Bleed, bitch.</i>

1:00:42.673 --> 1:00:44.775
<i>Bleed for what you did
to my father.</i>

1:01:08.799 --> 1:01:10.200
<i>Boom!
Oh, yes!</i>

1:01:10.200 --> 1:01:11.869
<i>Ooh, that's what
I wanted to do, though.</i>

1:01:11.869 --> 1:01:13.037
<i>Okay.
Huh? Huh?</i>

1:01:13.037 --> 1:01:14.204
<i>I'm not worried
about you, come on.</i>

1:01:14.204 --> 1:01:15.272
What you got, Ma?
Mm!

1:01:15.272 --> 1:01:16.373
- Ooh!
- That's what I like to see.

1:01:16.373 --> 1:01:17.708
<i>Take that.</i>

1:01:17.708 --> 1:01:19.076
<i>Go ahead.
Let's go, let's go.</i>

1:01:19.076 --> 1:01:20.210
<i>Bring it home.
Let's go, Di.</i>

1:01:20.210 --> 1:01:21.412
<i>Bring it home.
I got you.</i>

1:01:21.412 --> 1:01:22.713
<i>Watch this.
Oh, watch this.</i>

1:01:22.713 --> 1:01:23.914
<i>Yes!</i>

1:01:23.914 --> 1:01:25.049
<i>That's my partner.</i>

1:01:25.049 --> 1:01:26.350
<i>No, no, no.
Uh-uh-uh.</i>

1:01:26.350 --> 1:01:27.851
<i>We gotta celebrate
because it's--</i>

1:01:27.851 --> 1:01:29.319
<i>Whose partner is that?
Okay, come on.</i>

1:01:29.319 --> 1:01:30.854
<i>Whose partner is that?
Thank you!</i>

1:01:30.854 --> 1:01:32.089
I need to know
that you've been owned.

1:01:32.089 --> 1:01:33.257
That's it. Come on. Boom.

1:01:33.257 --> 1:01:34.358
<i>Come on with me.</i>
- Yes.

1:01:34.358 --> 1:01:35.959
