WEBVTT

00:05.050 --> 00:07.320
- Ow.
- Sorry.

00:09.980 --> 00:14.220
- Daddy, can I ask you something?
- We finish brushing first.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.320
Daddy! But I really
wanna ask you something.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.240
Okay, what do you want to ask me?

00:20.800 --> 00:22.810
When are we gonna
go to Mama's again?

00:23.560 --> 00:27.490
Okay. Tomorrow I take you to school.
And then Mama picks you up.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.820
And then you're with her for a few
days, and then you come back here.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.680
Well, okay.

00:34.020 --> 00:35.410
I like Mama's better.

00:36.630 --> 00:40.470
I like Mama's better
because she makes good food.

00:41.690 --> 00:45.050
And I love her more
so I like being there more.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.360
Okay. Alright, baby.

00:51.490 --> 00:53.310
I like being here too.

00:53.430 --> 00:55.690
It's just... Mama's better.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.050
Okay.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.640
Let's rinse and spit, alright?

01:05.150 --> 01:07.170
Go on! Alright, go get on your PJs!

01:07.290 --> 01:08.300
Okay baby!

01:59.160 --> 02:00.810
So, I've got 2 kids, 5 and 9.

02:00.930 --> 02:03.630
And I... I love it.
I love having kids, but it's hard.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.220
It can be very difficult.

02:05.770 --> 02:10.350
One thing that's difficult is that
they are very different ages, 5 and 9.

02:10.470 --> 02:12.870
Very different developmental stages.

02:12.990 --> 02:15.500
And, uh, I have them to myself
when I have them.

02:15.553 --> 02:18.160
My ex-wife and I split
custody. I'm with them half the week.

02:18.197 --> 02:21.510
I have to find things that
the three of us can do together.

02:21.910 --> 02:24.150
Now, my 9-year old can do a lot.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.350
She got a lot of skills,
a lot of things she can do.

02:26.376 --> 02:29.540
The 5-year old's not
much good at anything really.

02:29.990 --> 02:32.150
And it's not to put her down, she's five,

02:32.270 --> 02:36.130
but she's shitty at
pretty much everything.

02:36.250 --> 02:39.590
So, we can't do things that
outclass her abilities.

02:39.710 --> 02:43.750
So we just have to be all dragged
down to her shitty skill level.

02:44.210 --> 02:48.540
We're like three 5-year olds
of different sizes, basically.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.640
Because nothing... Let's go for a bike
riding at the river.

02:51.760 --> 02:55.590
"I'm not very confident on my
bicycle." Okay, let's just sit...

02:56.460 --> 02:58.960
And play the card game
where no one loses.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.670
We went swimming one time,
the three of us. That was a nightmare,

03:08.790 --> 03:11.230
because we're in this pool.
There was a deep end. There's a shallow end.

03:11.350 --> 03:13.870
The older one is in the deep end.
The 9-year old, she's having

03:13.899 --> 03:16.986
a ball, but she's lonely.
Who wants to swim by themselves?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.603
She's in the deep end doing flipper tricks,
and she's like,

03:19.723 --> 03:22.080
"Daddy, swim with me!"
I'm... I can't,

03:22.310 --> 03:25.090
Cause I'm in the shallow end with the
little one, who's clinging to my leg.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.200
In fear. "Don't put me
in the water!" I'm like...

03:28.320 --> 03:31.080
It's not... it's this... it's
to your tits at the highest.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.610
Just stand there.
It's fine.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.890
"No, I'm gonna drown,
there's sharks!"

03:37.550 --> 03:39.950
Why would I lie to you?

03:41.500 --> 03:44.710
Really? I would put you in
and "Haha, you're drowning!"

03:44.830 --> 03:46.450
"I tricked you to death."

03:46.570 --> 03:48.710
Really, I'm gonna do that?

03:50.190 --> 03:51.980
If I wanted to kill you,
I'd wait 'till you're asleep

03:52.100 --> 03:54.580
and go like this for 4 minutes.
And it's over.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.820
Okay? That's how easy
it would be to kill you.

03:56.940 --> 03:59.560
You should thank me every
morning you wake up alive.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.260
That's how easy it
would be to kill you.

04:03.683 --> 04:06.030
I know how to look after you!

04:06.972 --> 04:09.330
I'm good at it!
You're not dead yet!

04:54.150 --> 04:55.540
Lily, do your homework.

04:55.770 --> 04:58.640
Stop reading and do
your homework, please.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.830
Goddamn I hate being ignored.
I really do. I really hate it.

05:02.130 --> 05:04.020
Please. Homework.
Do it, please.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.770
- Sorry, daddy.
- It's okay, thank you very much.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.640
- Here you go.
- Thank you, daddy.

05:39.760 --> 05:40.710
You're welcome.

05:45.710 --> 05:47.480
Can I have a mango pop?

05:48.070 --> 05:49.110
No, there's only one.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.330
That's not fair.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.070
- It's not fair, daddy.
- What?

05:56.600 --> 05:59.300
Lily got a mango pop and I didn't get one.

05:59.420 --> 06:00.100
Yup.

06:01.790 --> 06:02.930
Well, that's not fair.

06:03.050 --> 06:04.440
I don't know even
know what that means.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.040
- Why does she get one, and not me?
- Cause she's a separate person from you.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.410
You're never gonna get the same things as
other people. It's never gonna be equal.

06:11.530 --> 06:14.510
It's not gonna happen every of your life so,
you must learn that now, okay?

06:15.180 --> 06:16.970
Well then I get something else yummy

06:17.610 --> 06:19.600
- I get something else.
- What do you mean you get?

06:20.750 --> 06:22.230
- I get something else yummy.
- No, nobody.

06:22.940 --> 06:24.710
Okay, nobody gets anything.

06:24.830 --> 06:27.350
She got something.
She got a mango pop.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.900
Yep. That's... That's...
Right now she's lucky.

06:30.020 --> 06:31.870
And you're not particularly lucky.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.260
Maybe later you'll be lucky.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.240
- Maybe...
- But it's so not fair!

06:35.360 --> 06:37.620
You only should be concerned with
what somebody else--

06:37.740 --> 06:38.850
It's not fair!

06:38.970 --> 06:42.150
I'm telling you something right now.
You should only ever be concerned

06:42.950 --> 06:45.330
- with...
- You are not fair.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.310
The only time you look
in your neighbors bowl

06:49.790 --> 06:51.820
is to make sure
that they have enough.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.150
You don't look at your neighbour's
bowl to see if they have..

06:55.270 --> 06:57.100
..it's to make sure you have

06:57.470 --> 07:01.660
as much as them. You want to
just make sure that they are...

07:03.550 --> 07:06.700
- Can I please have some calcium chocolate?
- Yes, you can have a calcium chocolate.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.430
Make sure your
sister gets one too.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.670
- Thank you, daddy.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.270
Oh my God!

07:28.390 --> 07:30.470
- Oh holy sh...
- Let me give you a hug, little brother.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.830
God!

07:33.950 --> 07:36.000
- Where are those little pieces of shit?
- Girls!

07:36.120 --> 07:37.640
- Hello!
- Girls!

07:37.760 --> 07:41.120
- It's your aunt Gretchen.
- Oh... my... God.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.230
- Yay.
- Oh my God!

07:43.350 --> 07:46.380
Oh, I want to kill you both,
I hate you so much.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.760
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm not staying,

07:49.880 --> 07:53.280
- I'm just in town to get procedure tomorrow.
- No, no, you're staying.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.220
- Dude, I'm fine.
- Shut up yourself.

07:55.340 --> 07:57.620
- You're staying.
- I just wanted to surprise you.

07:57.740 --> 07:59.370
Come on, get in.

08:00.260 --> 08:01.220
Get inside.

08:03.490 --> 08:06.220
- They're sleeping now.
- Huh. Wow.

08:06.700 --> 08:10.000
It's 8 o'clock. You're amazing.
And good dinner too.

08:10.380 --> 08:12.350
You're really doing the
dad thing for real.

08:12.570 --> 08:13.620
Yeah, well...

08:13.740 --> 08:17.150
Seriously, Louie. Some of didn't know
if you were gonna show up for this.

08:17.270 --> 08:20.180
- I know. Me too.
- But you're really doing it.

08:20.590 --> 08:23.430
No, you're not a bullshit
Sunday dad, like some people we know.

08:23.550 --> 08:25.720
You're raising your girls.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.360
Well, I get a lot out of it too.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.870
I love having 'em here,
they keep me company.

08:30.140 --> 08:32.720
- Yeah.
- You know it's not boring, I mean...

08:32.840 --> 08:35.670
Alright, there are times when
I wish that... they weren't alive.

08:37.030 --> 08:37.600
Yeah.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.610
It gets hard though.
It can be hard.

08:39.730 --> 08:43.150
Well, no shit. And they need it.
They need their dad.

08:43.510 --> 08:45.970
Especially when they're mom
is such a piece of shit.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.730
- Please, don't.
- She sucks shit out of a sprinkler.

08:48.850 --> 08:51.890
Listen, I gotta be at peace
with her, you know?

08:52.010 --> 08:54.550
I mean her folks probably
say the same shit about me.

08:54.670 --> 08:57.370
I'm sure they do.
And F them, and F her.

08:57.490 --> 08:59.990
I know you don't go there
but I get to say what I want.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.880
I had to go to that stupid wedding
of yours and pretend. Not anymore.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.030
- Please stop.
- Yeah, but kinda keep going, right?

09:08.820 --> 09:11.470
I know. She's your kid's mom.

09:11.590 --> 09:14.060
And you made her that and
when you made that choice.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.030
You had to live with that
but I didn't.

09:16.150 --> 09:18.380
So, I get to say that pasty,

09:18.500 --> 09:22.040
big tittied, black-eyed
Guinea bitch can suck my dick.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.960
Oh, wow, daddy, that's harsh.

09:26.530 --> 09:27.830
Okay.

09:29.940 --> 09:32.380
- When are you due?
- 2 months.

09:32.820 --> 09:34.780
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

09:34.900 --> 09:38.130
Well, since I lost the last one
I don't believe anything they say.

09:38.850 --> 09:41.610
- And so...
- So, who's the dad?

09:42.200 --> 09:44.870
- It's an interesting question.
- Who cares?

09:46.680 --> 09:48.840
- Okay.
- No, there is no dad.

09:49.330 --> 09:50.450
There's no dad?

09:50.570 --> 09:52.780
Donor number 647.

09:53.130 --> 09:55.200
- Ah, okay.
- And uhm...

09:55.320 --> 09:57.390
Carlos and I aren't together anymore.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.810
And after we lost the last one...

10:02.780 --> 10:04.360
I am sorry.

10:06.420 --> 10:07.470
Shit.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.460
When we lost the last one...

10:12.860 --> 10:14.470
We just went through too much.

10:14.590 --> 10:17.300
You know it got ugly. And...

10:17.550 --> 10:19.740
He left and...

10:20.020 --> 10:21.720
I looked in my life and...

10:22.160 --> 10:24.190
I said "screw it"!

10:25.220 --> 10:28.420
You know I'm in my 40s.
I'm fatter than shit.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.910
I don't want a man,
I wanna be a mom.

10:33.450 --> 10:36.840
Mom is... the only person
I ever admired, you know?

10:39.220 --> 10:39.960
Yeah.

10:41.050 --> 10:42.600
- You're going to be an uncle.
- Good, man.

10:43.330 --> 10:44.980
- That's alright.
- Yeah.

10:45.100 --> 10:48.810
When you get divorced, you
don't get divorced right on time.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.730
Nobody gets divorced right,

10:51.850 --> 10:55.740
perfect. It just went bah, just now!
Let's stop.

10:56.410 --> 10:58.200
That's not what happens.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.790
You get divorced after
being in a... just a shit

11:01.910 --> 11:05.170
marriage for several years.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.340
And you were only aware of it for one

11:07.790 --> 11:10.900
because... by the way I know you're
all getting quiet and sad.

11:11.020 --> 11:13.340
It's not... It's not...

11:14.960 --> 11:17.950
I'm not saying don't get married.
By the way: go ahead and get married.

11:18.190 --> 11:21.540
Fall in love. Get married.
And then get divorced.

11:22.530 --> 11:27.360
And raise your kids properly in
two well-adjusted happy homes.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.240
What can be better than that?

11:30.610 --> 11:34.970
Would you rather grow up
in a home full of just gnarly [beep].

11:35.090 --> 11:39.170
Just shit passed on
from generation to ge...

11:39.290 --> 11:44.160
You know, like an unbroken
chain of shitty marriages.

11:44.390 --> 11:47.729
And they're all like weigh
on this one little child's head. This big.

11:48.230 --> 11:51.530
And it's grandma and
grandpa's shit marriage.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.890
And the parent and the kids like...

11:55.260 --> 11:57.500
And the kid carries it through their life,

11:57.620 --> 12:00.190
until he finds someone else
to give him the half of it.

12:00.310 --> 12:04.290
And now they have two and they
[beep] crush it down on another kid's head.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.050
It's just humane...

12:08.830 --> 12:12.520
...to go let his kid be in two
houses full of people

12:12.640 --> 12:15.980
that are just [bleep] and having fun.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.400
And not yelling at each other.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.430
It's fair to do that.

12:26.134 --> 12:26.916
Ahh.

12:28.357 --> 12:29.271
Oh my God.

12:33.729 --> 12:34.958
Louie!

12:48.859 --> 12:49.829
Gretchen?

12:53.566 --> 12:55.499
- Oh Jesus.
- Gretchen.

12:55.619 --> 12:58.219
- What's the matter?
- That hurts.

12:58.339 --> 13:00.809
You're having a baby right now?

13:00.929 --> 13:03.259
No, it hurts in a different kinda hurt.

13:03.379 --> 13:06.159
- Ah, my baby's dying.
- No-no-no, it's okay.

13:07.349 --> 13:09.369
Oh no.
Get me to the hospital.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.679
- Just a second.
- Get me.

13:11.799 --> 13:14.709
- I'm calling 911.
- No, no, get me to a hospital!

13:15.029 --> 13:18.099
- Just get me there.
- Gretchen, I need you to just...

13:18.219 --> 13:20.349
Alright, just a second.

13:20.469 --> 13:22.349
- Get me to the hospital.
- Who's knocking at

13:22.469 --> 13:24.459
the goddamn door!

13:30.629 --> 13:31.219
What?

13:31.339 --> 13:33.729
- Who are you?
- We are neighbours from across the hall.

13:33.849 --> 13:34.759
We heard screaming.

13:34.879 --> 13:37.339
I'm sorry, we're having
a pregnant emergency right now.

13:37.459 --> 13:40.689
No, friend, you misunderstand. We didn't come
to complain, we came because someone's hurt.

13:43.849 --> 13:44.789
What? What?

13:44.909 --> 13:48.389
- We came to help. To help you.
- No, thank you very much.

13:48.509 --> 13:50.459
My friend, my friend.
Stop for a second.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.639
Think. Take a breath.
Thinking will help. Hyperventilating will not.

13:54.899 --> 13:56.429
Tell me your situation.

13:56.549 --> 13:59.669
Why she's screaming? We don't think you're
hurting her, but tell me what's going on.

14:00.859 --> 14:02.539
Alright, okay, okay!

14:03.789 --> 14:05.519
Okay, okay, okay.

14:05.639 --> 14:07.409
It's okay.

14:07.679 --> 14:09.099
Tell me. What?

14:10.719 --> 14:12.889
My sister's pregnant, and she's
having a bad pain.

14:13.009 --> 14:15.299
And I'm alone with her, but I
have my kids here. I don't know what--

14:15.419 --> 14:18.529
It's okay. Peter will stay with the children,
you and I will take your sister to the hospital.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.669
- No, no, no.
- Friend.

14:20.789 --> 14:22.279
You have no choice.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.959
We are your neighbours.
If we steal your kids,

14:25.079 --> 14:26.399
just come knock on the door,
and we'll give them back.

14:26.519 --> 14:29.959
Peter is a born mother. You need
help getting her to the hospital.

14:30.289 --> 14:31.489
I called 911.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.799
<i>If your emergency is of
a medical nature...</i>

14:33.919 --> 14:35.639
- 911 is for shit.
- Such assholes.

14:44.789 --> 14:45.809
Brother.

14:48.439 --> 14:50.779
Do not let your sister die
from pain or lose her baby,

14:50.899 --> 14:52.789
because you're awkward with strangers.

14:53.009 --> 14:55.389
You have to think fast
and make the right choice.

14:55.779 --> 14:56.909
Let's go.

15:03.999 --> 15:04.659
Let's go.

15:07.439 --> 15:08.519
Oh God no.

15:10.749 --> 15:12.249
Okay. We're going to the hospital.

15:13.459 --> 15:14.809
Oh my God.

15:17.439 --> 15:19.729
Do they have any food allergies?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.169
What? No!

15:26.349 --> 15:27.539
Oh shit.

15:35.189 --> 15:36.489
Taxi! Taxi!

15:37.399 --> 15:39.269
Taxi! Hey!

15:40.429 --> 15:41.609
Asshole!

15:41.729 --> 15:42.859
Nobody's stopping.

15:42.979 --> 15:45.119
Would you? Look at us.

15:45.469 --> 15:47.369
Take her please. Take her.

15:54.519 --> 15:56.809
[Spanish]

15:56.929 --> 15:58.519
Hey! He's going to take us.

15:59.179 --> 16:00.809
Oh God! Ow!

16:01.769 --> 16:02.519
Thank you!

16:05.569 --> 16:07.549
Help!

16:07.669 --> 16:09.769
Help now! Help!

16:10.139 --> 16:12.979
Please. Please.

16:36.069 --> 16:36.949
Two months! Two months!

16:49.269 --> 16:50.029
I'm sorry.

16:50.789 --> 16:51.879
I'm fine.

16:53.929 --> 16:54.639
Okay.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.379
Excuse me.

16:57.989 --> 16:59.559
Thank you very much, I'm sorry.

17:08.699 --> 17:09.799
Dude.

17:16.949 --> 17:18.069
So, you going to be OK?

17:18.349 --> 17:20.729
Yeah, she's already asleep, so...

17:20.849 --> 17:23.629
- The kids didn't wake up?
- No. Darn it. I wanted to see them.

17:24.629 --> 17:26.509
Well we should do that sometime.

17:27.809 --> 17:30.569
- Good night.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

17:30.689 --> 17:32.349
- Good night, my friend.
- Hey.

17:33.299 --> 17:35.699
Yes? Yes?

17:35.819 --> 17:38.469
I know it was just a fart, but...

17:39.069 --> 17:41.369
I couldn't have gone
through that without you.

17:45.199 --> 17:46.009
That's okay.

17:47.279 --> 17:48.869
I just I was really...

17:48.989 --> 17:50.069
...scared.

17:51.379 --> 17:52.779
I was really scared.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.859
That's because she's not my sister.

18:00.629 --> 18:01.899
That's why you need neighbours,

18:02.019 --> 18:05.299
people that aren't in your family to
help you when you need it.

18:07.679 --> 18:09.459
Well I didn't even know
you guys were there.

18:09.579 --> 18:11.129
No, you didn't.

18:11.249 --> 18:14.129
But now you do.
Now you who your neighbours are.

18:15.239 --> 18:16.809
Don't forget it.

18:18.039 --> 18:19.079
Good night!

18:28.329 --> 18:29.889
I have a new friend.

18:30.899 --> 18:34.459
Which is weird. I'm 43.

18:34.909 --> 18:37.669
And I'm a father, I'm divorced.
I have a new friend.

18:38.319 --> 18:40.919
And it makes me a little sick to
my stomach. I don't like it.

18:41.489 --> 18:43.339
Do you ever make a new friend?

18:43.459 --> 18:46.329
When you young people make new friends,
it's easy 'cause you're just young

18:46.449 --> 18:48.389
and you just... you're fabulous

18:48.509 --> 18:51.909
I'm 43, and when I'm starting
to make a friend it's creepy.

18:52.759 --> 18:56.919
It's creepy like... I hung out
with this guy who I don't know.

18:57.169 --> 19:00.999
And then I was like... I'm Inside my head,
I'm like, I want to see him again.

19:05.289 --> 19:07.419
I wanna see this guy again.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.789
If I just let him go,

19:10.039 --> 19:14.189
I'll never see him again.
I need to say something.

19:14.539 --> 19:18.519
And I felt so sick,
like I felt... so disgusting.

19:19.819 --> 19:23.909
Why did it bother me so much to say to
this fella, "I'd like to see you again."

19:24.469 --> 19:28.039
It's just... You know why? I realized
it was because I was afraid

19:28.159 --> 19:29.859
he might say no.

19:29.979 --> 19:31.689
I was afraid

19:34.289 --> 19:36.179
of being rejected!

19:36.299 --> 19:38.229
So I don't wanna make
him say that, but I did.

19:38.349 --> 19:41.629
I said I'd really like to...
hang out again.

19:41.989 --> 19:46.069
And he said "Yeah. Okay" and uhm...

19:46.189 --> 19:49.069
..and then I ate his asshole.

19:51.639 --> 19:52.499
It's my new friend!

19:55.499 --> 19:57.089
What are friends for?

20:00.439 --> 20:03.149
If you don't eat your friend's
asshole with your tongue,

20:03.269 --> 20:06.259
you're a piece of shit, you're not
a friend, you're not a friend.

20:08.109 --> 20:10.139
You're a fairweather friend.

20:18.219 --> 20:20.559
I love that kid!
I love that kid to pieces.

20:20.679 --> 20:23.539
But I wish she was never born.

20:23.659 --> 20:25.169
That's how it feels.

20:25.289 --> 20:27.499
In certain tiny moments.

20:27.869 --> 20:30.819
Any parent who's
honest will tell you

20:31.109 --> 20:33.199
that you live with that ambivalence.

20:33.419 --> 20:38.129
You just have it. You look at
the face of your beautiful, lovely child.

20:38.409 --> 20:41.139
And you think two things
at the exact same time.

20:41.629 --> 20:45.249
I love this kid so much
that it's changed my whole life.

20:45.519 --> 20:49.299
I love people, other people more,
because of how much I love her.

20:49.419 --> 20:52.159
I love people that died
years ago more.

20:52.279 --> 20:54.489
Like, my love has traveled time.

20:54.609 --> 20:56.739
Because of how much
I love her and she loves me back.

20:56.859 --> 21:00.579
She's completely given value
to life that didn't exist before.

21:00.699 --> 21:03.179
And I regret every decision
that led to her birth.

21:03.939 --> 21:05.329
That's how it feels!
