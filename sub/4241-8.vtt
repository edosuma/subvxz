00:00.220 --> 00:01.359
Here's what you missed on Glee:

00:01.359 --> 00:03.281
Kurt's still getting harassed and
doesn't know what to do about it.

00:03.282 --> 00:04.300
I am gonna kill you.

00:04.301 --> 00:06.140
Finn and Kurt got mad 
at each other, because Kurt had

00:06.141 --> 00:08.095
a crush on Finn, and then
Finn called him a nasty name,

00:08.096 --> 00:09.954
but it also wasn't cool that
Kurt couldn't take a hint,

00:09.955 --> 00:11.853
and their parents are dating,
so it's a little awkward.

00:11.854 --> 00:13.007
Sam and Quinn are sort of dating,

00:13.008 --> 00:14.209
and Sue sort of
dated Rod Remington.

00:14.210 --> 00:15.625
You sunk my battleship,

00:15.626 --> 00:17.527
Rod, and you sunk it hard.

00:17.528 --> 00:19.486
But then she caught him cheating,
so she's back on the market,

00:19.487 --> 00:21.278
and that's what you
missed on Glee.

00:29.965 --> 00:31.876
Oh. What's going on?

00:32.336 --> 00:33.928
Is this one of those
interventions, 'cause...?

00:33.929 --> 00:35.308
If it is, it's for the both of us.

00:35.309 --> 00:37.253
They bombarded me and forced
me to bring them to you.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.205
Okay, come on, tell 'em.

00:38.206 --> 00:38.994
- No, no, no, you.
- Come on.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.073
No. We said in the car.

00:40.074 --> 00:40.815
Come on, you, you.

00:40.816 --> 00:41.584
- Come on, you.
- Please!

00:41.585 --> 00:44.906
All right, so you know how I drive
Carole to work every Tuesday?

00:44.989 --> 00:47.277
Well, today I drove here,

00:47.278 --> 00:50.659
and we snuck into that classroom
where Kurt introduced us...

00:50.660 --> 00:53.450
very romantic of me,
I might add... And I...

00:53.451 --> 00:54.892
He proposed! He proposed!

00:54.893 --> 00:56.334
You stole the punch line!

00:56.588 --> 00:57.564
Come on!

00:57.565 --> 00:59.093
Wow. This just happened?

00:59.094 --> 01:00.420
Oh, Dad!

01:00.634 --> 01:02.539
Oh! We wanted the two of you
to be the first to know.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.031
Yeah, after the kids
in that homeroom.

01:04.032 --> 01:05.996
Come on, family hug, huh?

01:05.997 --> 01:07.060
Okay. Come on!

01:09.916 --> 01:11.677
I'm so excited and-and nervous!

01:11.678 --> 01:12.877
- Oh, don't be, don't be.
- Well, no. Okay.

01:12.878 --> 01:14.307
Oh, my God, this is
just what I needed.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.669
I will take care of it from here.

01:15.670 --> 01:18.626
I have a trunk full of wedding
magazines hidden under my bed.

01:18.627 --> 01:21.490
I'm thinking of a
russet and cognac theme.

01:21.491 --> 01:23.456
Those are colors, Finn.
Fall wedding colors.

01:23.457 --> 01:24.070
Autumnal.

01:24.071 --> 01:25.515
Nothing too extravagant,
Kurt, okay?

01:25.516 --> 01:26.761
We're gonna use whatever
savings we have.

01:26.762 --> 01:28.369
We are spending it
on the honeymoon.

01:28.370 --> 01:29.895
That's right.
We're going to Waikiki.

01:29.896 --> 01:30.770
We're gonna go to the hotel

01:30.771 --> 01:32.387
where they put up the
guest stars on Lost.

01:32.388 --> 01:34.292
Finn, you-you haven't
said anything.

01:34.293 --> 01:35.699
Uh, I'm...

01:35.700 --> 01:37.407
I guess I'm just kind of stunned.

01:37.517 --> 01:39.743
Hey, don't worry. I'm already
looking for a bigger house.

01:39.744 --> 01:42.016
One where everybody's gonna get
their own rooms. All right?

01:42.017 --> 01:44.488
Come on, honey. Be happy for me.

01:46.805 --> 01:47.974
I am, Mom.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.209
All right, now listen, Kurt,

01:49.210 --> 01:50.947
Mr. Wedding Planner, I want
you to take care of one thing.

01:50.948 --> 01:53.225
I don't care about the food
or the booze at this party,

01:53.226 --> 01:54.849
but I want one heck of a band.

01:55.005 --> 01:55.915
I've been eating right.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.148
I've been exercising.

01:57.928 --> 01:59.478
And I want to boogie with
Carole at this wedding.

02:00.705 --> 02:01.671
And I will boogie.

02:01.672 --> 02:03.284
All right. It's already
taken care of, Dad.

02:03.285 --> 02:05.691
I'm going to hire the New
Directions as your band.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.345
Right? It won't cost you a cent.

02:07.346 --> 02:08.663
They're cheap, they're available.

02:09.175 --> 02:10.424
Long story short...

02:11.030 --> 02:12.488
you're having a Glee wedding.

02:16.289 --> 02:18.787
Today is a red-letter day.

02:19.093 --> 02:22.621
The big day has finally
arrived for one Sue Sylvester.

02:22.622 --> 02:24.107
Becky, get in here!

02:24.108 --> 02:27.715
Get these invites down
to the post office, stat.

02:27.923 --> 02:29.108
Got it, Coach.

02:29.851 --> 02:34.407
And to think that this joyous
occasion began in horror.

02:34.408 --> 02:38.361
which is why I just prefer to
think of the homeless as outdoorsy.

02:38.362 --> 02:40.230
So shine on, urban campers!

02:40.231 --> 02:42.002
You smell like adventure!

02:42.003 --> 02:44.720
And that's how Sue sees it.

02:44.721 --> 02:47.236
Sue, you're the bee's knees.

02:47.237 --> 02:48.182
Before we break,

02:48.183 --> 02:49.697
I'd like to make an announcement.

02:49.698 --> 02:51.626
Rod and I are engaged.

02:52.556 --> 02:54.835
I popped the question
in my building's

02:54.836 --> 02:57.493
common-use hot tub. Booyah.

02:57.494 --> 02:58.639
Not to worry, ladies.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.118
It's an open marriage.

03:00.119 --> 03:01.305
We'll be right back.

03:01.377 --> 03:03.883
How dare you humiliate
me like that!

03:03.884 --> 03:05.394
People know you and I dated.

03:05.395 --> 03:08.531
Sue, you can't tame the tiger.

03:08.532 --> 03:10.260
You've read my tattoos.

03:10.261 --> 03:11.157
Face it, Sue.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.637
You're never going
to find someone,

03:12.638 --> 03:14.433
and you're going to die alone.

03:15.599 --> 03:18.927
So I decided to try online dating.

03:21.234 --> 03:24.244
And there was only one
match for Sue Sylvester.

03:26.292 --> 03:28.722
One Sue Sylvester.

03:30.416 --> 03:32.116
So thanks, eDesperate.

03:32.117 --> 03:33.873
I'm over the moon.

03:33.874 --> 03:36.220
Or maybe I'm a little
high off this adhesive,

03:36.221 --> 03:38.951
but I want to scream from
the highest mountain,

03:38.952 --> 03:42.440
"Sue Sylvester is
marrying herself."

03:46.227 --> 03:48.551
Hey, is that safe?

03:48.552 --> 03:50.080
With your shoulder
messed up and all?

03:50.081 --> 03:51.992
Doesn't feel messed up to me.
Now that I'm healthy,

03:51.993 --> 03:53.474
I'm going to be gunning
to get my job back.

03:53.698 --> 03:56.700
Well, Coach Beiste isn't going to
replace me while we're winning.

03:56.701 --> 03:58.066
You can't win every game.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.939
Look, I still want to
be friends. It's just,

03:59.940 --> 04:02.903
I'm kind of on the cusp of being one
of the most popular guys in school.

04:03.796 --> 04:05.065
Wow. I, uh...

04:05.206 --> 04:07.403
I didn't think you were the type
that cared about that stuff.

04:07.404 --> 04:09.311
Everyone does. Being on top

04:09.312 --> 04:10.764
means you don't have to
take crap from anybody.

04:10.765 --> 04:13.100
No teasing, no Slushee facials.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.668
Being quarterback isn't
going to put you on top,

04:16.601 --> 04:19.617
especially since you can't even
get Quinn to be your girlfriend.

04:19.618 --> 04:20.812
I'm working on that, too.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:30.403 --> 04:32.415
So, what do you want to
talk about in private?

04:32.416 --> 04:35.880
These galactic mobiles
aren't the stars of McKinley.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.504
We are.

04:37.868 --> 04:39.383
Or at least, I want us to be.

04:39.384 --> 04:40.445
Okay.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.311
I think I love you.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.424
Look, my shoulder's healed, I'm going
to be the quarterback again soon.

04:49.572 --> 04:51.253
And you're already
the head cheerleader.

04:53.299 --> 04:55.163
Oh, my God, are you proposing?

04:55.285 --> 04:57.470
We've known each other
for six weeks. Stand up.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.453
- You're freaking me out.
- I want to marry you...

04:59.780 --> 05:01.977
some day. Until then,

05:01.978 --> 05:03.801
will you accept this promise ring?

05:04.895 --> 05:06.570
What are you, six?

05:06.571 --> 05:08.043
If you accept,

05:08.983 --> 05:12.399
this ring will symbolize my
promise to you to be true,

05:12.400 --> 05:15.759
to never pressure you to
do anything more than kiss,

05:15.760 --> 05:16.855
to listen to your problems,

05:16.856 --> 05:19.412
to tell you when you
have food in your teeth

05:19.413 --> 05:21.715
or eye gunk, to come over to
your house whenever you need

05:21.716 --> 05:23.284
something super
heavy moved around.

05:23.742 --> 05:27.203
I promise to make you feel proud

05:27.204 --> 05:29.817
when you point down
the hall and say,

05:29.818 --> 05:31.531
"That dude's my boyfriend."

05:31.713 --> 05:34.265
And I promise to do
all of those things

05:34.293 --> 05:36.593
without ever trying to sound
like Matthew McConaughey.

05:41.973 --> 05:43.702
I really care about you, Quinn.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.810
And I want us to be together.

05:53.790 --> 05:54.915
Is that a no?

05:55.981 --> 05:57.257
It's a maybe.

06:09.558 --> 06:12.057
Hey, uh, so I've been
reviewing this itinerary,

06:12.058 --> 06:13.497
and I don't really get it.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.040
Are you sure we should release
300 live doves indoors?

06:16.041 --> 06:17.778
Won't that get kind of messy?

06:17.779 --> 06:19.681
That's why we feed
them glitter, Finn.

06:20.220 --> 06:23.457
Oh. Well, look,
I've been thinking about it.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.780
I really want to do something
special for the wedding, and

06:25.781 --> 06:27.022
I wanted to take this opportunity

06:27.023 --> 06:31.780
to sort of remind everyone that I'm,
you know, a leader.

06:32.132 --> 06:33.547
I have the perfect idea.

06:33.771 --> 06:35.255
After you walk your
mom down the aisle,

06:35.256 --> 06:36.567
and give her away to my dad...

06:36.568 --> 06:37.242
Incredibly creepy.

06:37.243 --> 06:38.733
and give your speech
to the newlyweds...

06:38.734 --> 06:40.294
which I will write,
although you are free

06:40.295 --> 06:41.642
to suggest overall themes...

06:41.643 --> 06:43.208
you and Carole will have a lovely

06:43.209 --> 06:44.696
mother-and-son dance
in front of everyone.

06:44.697 --> 06:45.992
Ah, that's a terrible idea.

06:45.993 --> 06:47.645
Everybody knows I'm
the worst dancer.

06:47.646 --> 06:48.725
Finn, trust me on this.

06:48.726 --> 06:50.677
I've been planning
weddings since I was two.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.435
My Power Rangers got
married and divorced

06:52.436 --> 06:54.277
in so many combinations,
they were like Fleetwood Mac.

06:54.278 --> 06:55.731
I guess if I could pull it off,

06:56.574 --> 06:58.698
it would make me seem
like a cool stud.

06:58.699 --> 06:59.836
Totally.

06:59.912 --> 07:01.780
Thanks. It's a plan.

07:11.201 --> 07:12.671
I don't want you near me.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.790
Can I have this?

07:28.292 --> 07:29.488
Thanks.

07:35.419 --> 07:36.351
Are you okay?

07:38.879 --> 07:39.739
No. No.

07:39.740 --> 07:41.822
Okay, let's go to the
principal, come on.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.096
Did he physically hurt you?

07:46.432 --> 07:47.014
No.

07:47.015 --> 07:48.667
You said he's shoved you
into the lockers before.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.269
Well, I can't expel
a kid for shoving.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.425
He'll just say, "I didn't mean
to shove that kid, I tripped!"

07:52.426 --> 07:53.543
Excuse works like a charm.

07:53.544 --> 07:54.501
I use it all the time.

07:54.502 --> 07:55.953
He didn't shove me this time.

07:55.954 --> 07:58.229
He just... terrified me.

07:58.230 --> 08:01.750
Lady, I can't suspend a
student because he scares you.

08:01.751 --> 08:04.690
High school is a dry run
for the rest of your life.

08:04.691 --> 08:07.030
It's rough. People can be mean.

08:07.031 --> 08:08.145
That's your advice?

08:08.372 --> 08:09.530
That's all you have to say?

08:09.531 --> 08:11.930
William, I was bullied
my entire life.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.295
I grew up with a
handicapable sister.

08:14.296 --> 08:17.040
I know very well how
cruel people can be.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.689
Was it difficult? Yes.

08:18.924 --> 08:20.329
Did it make me stronger?

08:21.139 --> 08:22.011
You bet it did.

08:22.012 --> 08:23.664
It's the fear that's the worst.

08:24.392 --> 08:26.986
I never know when it's coming,
I can't concentrate,

08:26.987 --> 08:28.799
I don't feel like I'm part
of this school at all.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.753
I feel like I'm in a horror
movie where this creature

08:30.754 --> 08:32.181
follows me around terrifying me,

08:32.182 --> 08:34.068
and there's nothing
that I can do about it?

08:34.070 --> 08:35.032
I mean, you...

08:35.416 --> 08:37.505
You don't know what's going
on in this kid's head.

08:37.506 --> 08:38.999
You don't know what
he's capable of.

08:42.053 --> 08:43.057
What does that mean?

08:43.192 --> 08:45.217
Nothing. Maybe I'm overreacting.

08:45.218 --> 08:48.959
Lady, this kid lays a finger on you,
you come straight to me,

08:48.960 --> 08:50.456
and I will expel him faster

08:50.457 --> 08:53.581
than a Thai take-out place can
read back your delivery order.

08:53.582 --> 08:54.735
Okay?

08:54.736 --> 08:55.733
But until that happens,

08:55.734 --> 08:58.151
and I'm genuinely
sorry to say this,

08:58.515 --> 09:01.360
there is nothing legally I
or the school board can do.

09:03.125 --> 09:03.641
Come on, Kurt.

09:03.642 --> 09:05.046
We're gonna be late for rehearsal.

09:09.890 --> 09:12.591
You know, when you call me lady...
That's bullying.

09:13.195 --> 09:14.151
And it's really hurtful.

09:14.152 --> 09:15.985
I'm sorry. I thought
that was your name.

09:15.986 --> 09:17.362
As an apology, I'll allow you

09:17.363 --> 09:19.142
to choose from the
following nicknames...

09:19.143 --> 09:22.756
Gelfling, Porcelain,
and Tickle-Me-Doughface.

09:24.214 --> 09:25.330
I guess I'll go with Porcelain.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.835
Damn. Totally wanted
Tickle-Me-Doughface.

09:29.514 --> 09:31.845
Ladies, the Kurt-Karofsky
bullying situation

09:31.846 --> 09:33.171
is getting way out of control.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.915
Kurt's miserable,
he's losing weight...

09:34.916 --> 09:36.127
and not in a good way.

09:36.128 --> 09:38.316
And he's barely even fighting
me for solos anymore.

09:38.317 --> 09:39.517
We've all been teased,
but something

09:39.518 --> 09:41.302
about what Karofsky's
doing is so much worse.

09:41.303 --> 09:43.236
We're all lucky enough to have
boyfriends on the football team.

09:43.237 --> 09:46.236
I say, we band together and demand
that they confront Karofsky.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.963
Okay, first off all,
I'm not dating Sam.

09:47.964 --> 09:49.063
And second of all,

09:49.064 --> 09:50.409
I think you personally just set

09:50.410 --> 09:52.013
the feminist movement
back 50 years.

09:52.014 --> 09:54.010
But guys like Karofsky
only respond to muscle.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.158
So we're going to fight
violence with violence? No!

09:56.159 --> 09:58.563
Look, I'm not saying
that they should hit him.

09:58.564 --> 10:00.458
What I'm saying is that
we need to defend Kurt,

10:00.459 --> 10:01.845
and there's strength in numbers.

10:01.846 --> 10:05.005
I'm confused. Are you and
Artie officially dating now?

10:05.147 --> 10:06.119
Deal with it.

10:07.462 --> 10:09.512
When you guys fooled around,
did he ever, like,

10:09.513 --> 10:10.608
just lie there?

10:10.830 --> 10:12.196
Why didn't you tell
me that we were having

10:12.197 --> 10:13.250
a Glee girls meeting?

10:13.251 --> 10:14.966
This is a meeting for Glee
girls with boyfriends.

10:14.967 --> 10:17.483
We're going to make them stop
Karofsky from bullying Kurt.

10:17.593 --> 10:20.264
Okay, I'm dating Puckerman.
You're getting naked with Puckerman.

10:20.265 --> 10:22.873
Besides, Puck can't mess with Karofsky;
He's on probation.

10:22.874 --> 10:24.919
If he gets in a fight with him,
he'll be sent back to juvee.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.224
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
so now if you'll excuse us.

10:28.487 --> 10:30.416
You're so on my list, dwarf.

10:31.606 --> 10:33.972
Look, if something
bad happens to Kurt,

10:33.973 --> 10:36.035
and we didn't do
anything to stop it,

10:36.281 --> 10:38.203
we'll never be able to
live with ourselves.

10:39.441 --> 10:40.621
I'm a little confused.

10:40.622 --> 10:43.353
I said not only am
I marrying myself,

10:43.354 --> 10:45.124
I will be officiating
the ceremony.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.090
I'm not, um...

10:46.091 --> 10:47.871
Marsha Dean, when I hired you

10:47.872 --> 10:50.102
and your crack team at
Marsha Dean Weddings,

10:50.103 --> 10:52.928
I did so because you
specialize in unique weddings.

10:52.929 --> 10:56.372
Well, that mostly means that
some of them take place outside.

10:56.373 --> 10:57.789
Marsha Dean, you are fired.

10:57.790 --> 10:58.972
You are out of your depth.

10:58.973 --> 11:01.449
And nothing is too
good for Sue Sylvester.

11:01.450 --> 11:03.354
Well, that's one
way to look at it.

11:03.524 --> 11:04.672
Hello.

11:05.306 --> 11:06.905
I'm Doris Sylvester.

11:06.906 --> 11:08.246
I'm this one's mother.

11:08.247 --> 11:11.400
Marsha, I'll bet people
say you look mannish.

11:11.401 --> 11:12.612
But you know something?

11:12.613 --> 11:16.075
I think it's perfectly all right
for a woman to be handsome.

11:19.190 --> 11:20.344
Takes all kinds.

11:20.868 --> 11:24.371
Susie, come give
your mother a hug.

11:25.364 --> 11:26.728
Please don't call me that.

11:26.865 --> 11:28.185
Come on, come on.

11:32.061 --> 11:34.276
Oh, you poked me in my sternum.

11:34.674 --> 11:37.565
I always forget that
you have this ribcage

11:37.566 --> 11:38.893
that's kind of weird...

11:38.894 --> 11:41.382
and adorable.
I think I'll sit down.

11:42.647 --> 11:44.571
Mom, what are you doing here?

11:44.572 --> 11:48.328
Good news, Suze.
We finally caught the last Nazi.

11:48.329 --> 11:50.719
For two and a half years,
we've been hot

11:50.720 --> 11:54.603
on the trail of Eva
Braun's great-nephew Chad.

11:54.604 --> 11:57.293
And you know what? He's been
under our noses this whole time.

11:57.294 --> 11:59.420
Working in Phoenix as a CPA.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.589
I felt bad taking him out.

12:03.817 --> 12:06.155
I mean, it's punishment
enough to live there.

12:06.403 --> 12:08.433
You ever been to Phoenix?
It's a hellhole.

12:08.434 --> 12:09.670
Mom, where have you been?

12:09.671 --> 12:11.468
I haven't seen you
or heard from you

12:11.469 --> 12:12.658
- in over three years.
- What do you mean?

12:12.659 --> 12:14.956
I-I wrote you all those postcards.

12:14.957 --> 12:17.270
I mean, granted, they were decoys.

12:17.271 --> 12:18.788
Have you been to see Jean yet?

12:18.789 --> 12:20.361
It's the top of my list.

12:21.373 --> 12:22.784
Look, I, uh...

12:23.129 --> 12:25.391
I know it's been a
long time, but...

12:25.994 --> 12:28.216
the work I was doing
was important.

12:28.426 --> 12:30.299
And I always wanted
to get back here

12:30.300 --> 12:33.326
and be a mother to
you girls again.

12:34.025 --> 12:35.725
And Susie, I have to ask you,

12:35.726 --> 12:38.366
what is it with this
ridiculous wedding?

12:38.367 --> 12:39.518
Have you given up on love?

12:39.519 --> 12:40.983
No, Mother. Quite the opposite.

12:40.984 --> 12:42.164
I mean, when you were little,

12:42.165 --> 12:44.979
the other mothers used to tell
me that you'd never find anybody,

12:44.980 --> 12:47.706
but I said, "No, no, no, no.

12:47.741 --> 12:50.120
"She's a perfectly okay child.

12:50.121 --> 12:51.923
She'll grow into her looks."

12:52.195 --> 12:53.143
And you know what?

12:55.117 --> 12:56.520
I believe you still might.

12:56.521 --> 12:58.296
Mother, I am going through
with this wedding.

12:58.297 --> 13:00.522
And you are free to accept
the invitation or not.

13:00.523 --> 13:02.571
- Are you inviting me?
- I'm inviting you now.

13:02.572 --> 13:04.912
Well, I am accepting.
Don't get so huffy.

13:06.472 --> 13:09.796
Since your father's no
longer with us, I want to

13:09.797 --> 13:11.737
- walk you down the aisle.
- No. I'm doing that.

13:11.738 --> 13:14.037
Then I know exactly
what I'm going to do.

13:14.839 --> 13:17.795
You remember when you
were a little girl,

13:17.796 --> 13:19.794
and you used to ask
me to sing to you?

13:19.795 --> 13:21.295
And I never had the time.

13:21.296 --> 13:23.704
So you'd line up
your little dollies

13:23.705 --> 13:25.334
and they'd sing to each other?

13:25.335 --> 13:27.290
Appalachian murder ballads,

13:27.755 --> 13:29.531
but it was touching.

13:30.714 --> 13:32.072
You know something, though?

13:32.944 --> 13:35.254
I'm going to be there
for you this time.

13:36.342 --> 13:38.434
I'm going to sing at your wedding.

13:39.408 --> 13:41.520
But why? Karofsky
plays right guard.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.419
If he gets pissed at me, I'm
going to get sacked more times

13:43.420 --> 13:46.058
than Jay Cutler,
which means we're going to lose,

13:46.059 --> 13:47.811
which means Beiste is going
to make Sam quarterback.

13:47.812 --> 13:49.228
Is being quarterback
more important to you

13:49.229 --> 13:51.796
than helping out the kid who's
going to be your stepbrother?

13:51.797 --> 13:53.933
Look, we both know I can help
him more if I stay on top.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.275
Look, Kurt's going to be fine.

13:55.787 --> 13:58.171
Rachel, I'm sorry.

13:58.457 --> 13:59.775
I want to, but I can't.

14:00.582 --> 14:03.264
I've never been so
disappointed in you before.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.344
But...

14:10.025 --> 14:11.303
Stop picking on Kurt.

14:11.304 --> 14:12.622
You mind? I'm changing.

14:12.623 --> 14:13.758
We're serious.

14:15.177 --> 14:16.661
This is a warning. Oh, yeah?

14:16.662 --> 14:18.108
From now on, you're
gonna leave him alone.

14:18.448 --> 14:21.098
Look, if he wants to be a homo,

14:21.656 --> 14:24.179
that's up to him,
but don't rub it in my face.

14:24.180 --> 14:25.591
We're not asking you.

14:25.592 --> 14:27.433
Yeah, we're done
talking about this.

14:28.271 --> 14:29.337
Just back off, all right?

14:29.338 --> 14:30.998
Look, you back off. Hey!

14:32.248 --> 14:33.262
Artie, are you okay?

14:40.677 --> 14:41.933
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?!

14:41.934 --> 14:44.683
Get up! Get up here! Get up!

14:46.266 --> 14:48.260
What the hell's going on here?

14:52.640 --> 14:53.983
Dude was a wild animal.

14:53.984 --> 14:56.149
Manimal. I'm so turned
on by you right now.

14:56.150 --> 14:58.773
How bad does it look?
It's pretty hot, actually.

14:58.774 --> 14:59.567
You have no idea how hard

14:59.568 --> 15:01.206
it was for me not to
jump into that beatdown.

15:01.207 --> 15:02.108
Where were you, Finn?

15:02.109 --> 15:03.524
I was still out on
the field, okay?

15:03.525 --> 15:04.668
I totally would have given

15:04.669 --> 15:05.846
him a beatdown if I had
been there, though.

15:05.847 --> 15:08.082
The fact is, it shouldn't have
gone down without you, Finn.

15:08.395 --> 15:09.950
You should have been
leading the charge.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.488
Lay off Finn, everyone.
It isn't his problem.

15:12.816 --> 15:14.432
It's none of your problems,
actually.

15:15.106 --> 15:18.082
But thank you for what you did,
especially Sam.

15:18.162 --> 15:20.391
Serious, an epitome of a leader.

15:20.532 --> 15:21.542
What's going on?

15:21.884 --> 15:22.925
What happened to Sam's eye?

15:22.926 --> 15:24.317
He stood up to Karofsky.

15:24.318 --> 15:27.127
All the guys did. Well, not Finn.

15:27.128 --> 15:28.057
Is everyone okay?

15:28.058 --> 15:30.542
- Do we all need to go talk to Principal Sylvester?
- No.

15:30.543 --> 15:33.459
I got in a few good licks, too,
so we can just call it even.

15:34.172 --> 15:35.860
And maybe this will send
a warning to Karofsky,

15:35.861 --> 15:37.109
telling him to back off Kurt.

15:39.050 --> 15:40.138
You okay, Kurt?

15:41.624 --> 15:43.628
All right, guys.
Let's take our places.

15:43.866 --> 15:45.262
We got a wedding to prepare for.

15:49.572 --> 15:50.850
Well, Mr. Piano Man,

15:50.851 --> 15:52.341
I think I owe you an apology.

15:52.566 --> 15:54.397
Not to worry, Susie-Q.

15:54.650 --> 15:57.067
I arranged for us to
spend an hour in here

15:57.068 --> 15:59.961
with that, uh, that cutie-pie,
what's his, uh...

15:59.962 --> 16:01.304
handsome guy, what's his name?

16:01.352 --> 16:02.614
Will Schuster?

16:03.144 --> 16:04.337
Let's get this over with.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.174
Look...

16:05.804 --> 16:09.053
I know you've always
resented my leaving.

16:09.522 --> 16:12.739
But I don't think you
ever truly appreciated

16:12.740 --> 16:16.443
the sacrifices I made to
be a famous Nazi hunter.

16:16.444 --> 16:19.970
I don't think you ever thought
about how hard it was on me.

16:21.030 --> 16:24.883
So, this is the song I'm going
to sing at your wedding.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.158
Yoo-hoo! There we are.

16:26.964 --> 16:28.857
I know you know it.

16:29.270 --> 16:31.201
It's one of my favorites.

16:34.292 --> 16:35.536
Well, hit it!

16:41.786 --> 16:47.288
* Why, oh why, oh why, oh *

16:47.968 --> 16:53.256
* Why did I ever leave Ohio? *

16:54.093 --> 16:56.898
* Why did I wander *

16:57.104 --> 17:00.021
* To find what lies yonder *

17:00.022 --> 17:06.444
* When life was so cozy at home? *

17:06.445 --> 17:12.224
* Wondr'ing while I wander*

17:12.886 --> 17:15.943
* Why did I fly? *

17:15.944 --> 17:18.776
* Why did I roam? *

17:19.210 --> 17:21.977
* Oh why, oh why, oh *

17:21.978 --> 17:25.001
* Did I leave Ohio? *

17:25.002 --> 17:29.158
* Maybe I'd better go... *

17:29.362 --> 17:33.632
* O-H-I-O * * Oh... *

17:33.633 --> 17:36.633
* Maybe I'd better go home. *

17:45.795 --> 17:47.482
Mother, this song
still doesn't explain

17:47.483 --> 17:49.390
why you abandoned your children.

17:49.391 --> 17:51.857
Ohio was stifling,
and we couldn't wait

17:51.858 --> 17:53.774
to get out of the place.
And I told you,

17:53.775 --> 17:56.203
"Sue, we're going to
be hunting Nazis."

17:56.204 --> 17:58.520
And Pop said, "Sue,
this might take a little while."

17:58.521 --> 18:00.171
Well, those Nazis are slippery,

18:00.172 --> 18:02.613
and me hunting them way
down in Lima, Peru...

18:02.614 --> 18:04.969
We'd get postcards
from Niagara Falls...

18:04.970 --> 18:07.553
While I'm stalking Mengele
in Bolivian malls.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.633
Three times a year,
we'd get crackling phone calls.

18:10.634 --> 18:12.429
Happy birthday! Hunting Nazis!

18:12.430 --> 18:14.357
Merry Christmas! Hunting Nazis!

18:14.358 --> 18:15.903
Homesick. Abandoned.

18:15.904 --> 18:17.705
Heartsick. Neglected.

18:17.706 --> 18:22.659
* Thank heavens we're free! *

18:24.454 --> 18:30.028
* Why, oh why, oh why, oh *

18:30.429 --> 18:36.222
* Why did I ever leave Ohio? *

18:43.132 --> 18:45.943
* Oh why, oh why, oh *

18:45.944 --> 18:50.103
* Did I leave Ohio? *

18:50.104 --> 18:53.301
* Maybe I'd better *

18:53.302 --> 18:55.902
* Stay home... *

19:11.346 --> 19:13.732
Well, that wasn't as good
as I thought it would be.

19:13.733 --> 19:15.566
Whoops! Wait a minute.

19:15.664 --> 19:17.458
I've got a fitting
for your wedding.

19:18.604 --> 19:21.178
I'm wearing white.
I know you won't mind.

19:21.179 --> 19:23.029
It goes with my skin tone.

19:23.030 --> 19:25.856
You? You got your
father's coloring.

19:26.378 --> 19:27.483
Give us a kiss.

19:31.410 --> 19:35.560
* Maybe I'd better stay home. *

19:37.078 --> 19:38.142
Thank you both for attending

19:38.143 --> 19:39.628
the Kurt Hummel
Wedding Dance Seminar.

19:40.005 --> 19:41.506
Dad, you're going
to have to pull off

19:41.507 --> 19:43.320
the first dance with Carole.
And if Uncle Andy's

19:43.321 --> 19:45.401
40th birthday party
was any indication,

19:45.402 --> 19:46.683
you're going to need some work.

19:46.684 --> 19:48.448
What are you talking about?
My moves were great, okay?

19:48.449 --> 19:50.484
It was the...
damn sangria... Okay.

19:50.485 --> 19:52.706
- We dance to the beat, not to the words.
- Affected my coordination.

19:52.707 --> 19:55.003
- I'm here, right?
- Yes, right here. Okay.

19:55.099 --> 19:57.296
All right, have you guys chosen a...
No... A wedding song?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.883
Uh, yes. We're thinking
"Stairway" or some Bubl?

19:59.919 --> 20:00.726
Okay. Great.

20:00.727 --> 20:02.958
So it's basically
one-two-three-four. Okay.

20:03.529 --> 20:05.329
Follow me, all right?
Gentleman leads on the left.

20:05.397 --> 20:06.431
Right. Opposite of me. Okay?

20:06.498 --> 20:07.665
Get ready? Opposite.

20:07.959 --> 20:10.095
One-two-three-four.

20:10.096 --> 20:11.061
Okay, getting back.

20:11.129 --> 20:12.596
Hey, look at me, I'm dancing, huh?

20:12.664 --> 20:14.031
Look at that! Yeah, okay.

20:14.098 --> 20:15.766
Come over here, and dance
with yourself, practice.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.467
Come on, Finn, no chickening out.

20:17.535 --> 20:19.136
I did it. You got to do it, too.

20:19.203 --> 20:21.038
Okay, uh...

20:22.974 --> 20:24.408
My feet are moving
and there's music.

20:24.475 --> 20:25.776
All right. Okay. Position.

20:25.843 --> 20:27.244
That's dancing. Uh...

20:27.312 --> 20:28.946
Can we... Can we shut the door?
I'm not really comfortable

20:29.013 --> 20:30.830
with people watching.
What are you talking about?

20:30.831 --> 20:32.534
You danced in front of
1,000 people at Regionals.

20:34.986 --> 20:36.820
Okay.

20:41.025 --> 20:43.727
What the hell was that?

20:43.795 --> 20:45.696
It's nothing, Dad.
That was not nothing.

20:45.763 --> 20:47.597
That guy was making fun of you.
What the hell's his name?

20:47.665 --> 20:49.132
Tell him, Kurt.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.834
Tell me what? Tell him, or I will.

20:50.902 --> 20:53.270
His name's Dave Karofsky.

20:53.338 --> 20:55.939
He's... been harassing
me for a few weeks now.

20:56.007 --> 20:57.274
Harassing you how?

20:57.342 --> 21:00.344
Just... Shoving me,
and giving me a hard time.

21:00.411 --> 21:01.945
There's more.

21:02.013 --> 21:03.313
There's something else
you're not telling me.

21:03.381 --> 21:04.581
He threatened to kill me.

21:06.150 --> 21:07.718
What? You've got to be kidding me.

21:07.785 --> 21:09.987
Burt!

21:10.054 --> 21:12.155
What the hell?
You like picking on people?

21:12.223 --> 21:14.024
What?! Why don't you try me?

21:14.092 --> 21:15.025
Burt! Stop!

21:15.093 --> 21:17.094
Please, you're sick. Come on.

21:23.352 --> 21:24.717
What the hell have you been doing

21:24.785 --> 21:26.378
while this is all going on, huh?

21:28.355 --> 21:29.288
Dad...

21:31.749 --> 21:34.184
So it seems the situation
has reached a boiling point.

21:34.252 --> 21:36.153
You're damn right, it has.
Nothing happened.

21:36.220 --> 21:38.355
I'll tell you what really happened.
Mr. Karofsky...

21:38.423 --> 21:39.689
My name's Paul.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.963
Paul, your kid threatened
the life of my son.

21:43.227 --> 21:45.376
Porcelain? Is that true?

21:46.264 --> 21:47.364
That's not true.
I didn't say anything.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.665
That's what he said.

21:48.733 --> 21:50.634
He said he would kill
me if I told anyone.

21:50.701 --> 21:52.803
If you told anyone what?

21:52.870 --> 21:56.606
Just... that he was picking on me.

21:56.674 --> 21:59.042
He's making all this stuff up.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.410
Oh, is that right? PAUL:
Hold on a sec.

22:00.478 --> 22:03.246
You have been acting
differently lately, David.

22:03.314 --> 22:04.714
You used to get A's and B's.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.217
You're talking back,
you're acting out,

22:07.285 --> 22:08.952
and now we're sitting here.

22:09.020 --> 22:13.762
So let me ask you:
Why would Kurt make that up?

22:14.826 --> 22:16.359
Maybe he likes me.

22:16.427 --> 22:19.930
I think we're wasting
our time here.

22:19.997 --> 22:21.631
It's your job to protect people.

22:21.699 --> 22:23.600
Couldn't agree more.

22:23.668 --> 22:26.808
After hearing both sides of the story,
you are hereby expelled.

22:26.809 --> 22:27.945
I will not have one student

22:27.946 --> 22:29.468
threatening the life of another.

22:29.469 --> 22:30.548
If you don't think this is fair,

22:30.549 --> 22:32.142
well, you can appeal
to the school board.

22:32.210 --> 22:33.910
You'll leave campus immediately.

22:36.576 --> 22:37.872
I appreciate your time.

22:46.133 --> 22:46.685
Thank you.

22:46.753 --> 22:48.123
Enjoy your wedding.

22:56.700 --> 22:57.480
Huh.

22:57.580 --> 22:59.114
Never learned how to tie a tie.

23:00.371 --> 23:01.646
Sit down, Frankenteen.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.775
I'm guessing you know
that you're losing it.

23:05.776 --> 23:08.784
I mean, Sam is clearly
the new Glee favorite,

23:08.785 --> 23:10.444
he's going to become
starting quarterback...

23:10.445 --> 23:12.255
What's your point? My point

23:12.256 --> 23:14.474
is that you need a
coolness injection.

23:14.668 --> 23:15.668
If you were honest and told people

23:15.736 --> 23:17.069
that we did it last year,

23:17.137 --> 23:19.212
you would go from uncool to
Chilly Willy in a heartbeat.

23:19.213 --> 23:21.184
Maybe, but I can't do that.

23:22.206 --> 23:23.306
Wait.

23:23.374 --> 23:24.278
What?

23:26.444 --> 23:28.378
There's something I
have to tell you.

23:28.446 --> 23:30.113
I didn't have sex with Jessie.

23:33.818 --> 23:37.654
I-I lied... to make you jealous.

23:37.722 --> 23:38.755
I-It's cool.

23:38.823 --> 23:40.157
Um, you know, I had a feeling,

23:40.224 --> 23:42.125
considering how much of a
prude you are with me...

23:42.193 --> 23:44.027
not that I'm complaining.
This is so much better

23:44.095 --> 23:47.464
because now neither of us have
done it and we can save it

23:47.532 --> 23:49.499
for each other.

23:49.567 --> 23:50.641
Awesome.

23:51.356 --> 23:53.193
If she found out,
she'd break up with me.

23:53.194 --> 23:54.571
And this would be bad because...?

23:54.572 --> 23:55.440
Because I'm in love with her

23:55.441 --> 23:56.546
and I don't want to
hurt her feelings.

23:56.547 --> 23:58.708
Okay, don't you see
that that midget is

23:58.776 --> 23:59.976
like an anchor dragging you

24:00.044 --> 24:01.912
down to the depths of Loserville?

24:01.979 --> 24:03.914
Oh, stop it, Santana,
that's my girlfriend.

24:03.981 --> 24:04.848
I think you should leave.

24:04.916 --> 24:05.941
All right.

24:05.942 --> 24:08.218
Well, maybe I'll tell her.

24:08.286 --> 24:09.352
I mean, if you two broke up,

24:09.420 --> 24:10.587
we'd be free to see
each other, right?

24:10.655 --> 24:11.521
Hey.

24:11.589 --> 24:13.356
What are you guys doing?

24:13.424 --> 24:14.459
Nothing.

24:14.559 --> 24:16.393
I was just leaving.

24:20.164 --> 24:22.132
Aren't you going to tell
me how pretty I look?

24:24.902 --> 24:26.836
You look amazing.

24:26.904 --> 24:29.573
What?

24:29.640 --> 24:31.575
I...

24:31.642 --> 24:34.211
I just really love you.

24:34.278 --> 24:35.912
I love you, too.

24:49.193 --> 24:51.361
* lt's a beautiful night *

24:51.429 --> 24:55.098
* We're looking for
something dumb to do *

24:55.166 --> 24:57.100
* Hey, baby *

24:57.168 --> 25:01.338
* I think I wanna marry you *

25:01.405 --> 25:02.416
* ls it the look in your eyes *

25:04.373 --> 25:05.062
Or is it?

25:05.063 --> 25:07.677
* This dancing juice? *

25:07.745 --> 25:10.647
* Who cares, baby? *

25:10.715 --> 25:13.416
* I think I wanna marry you *

25:13.484 --> 25:15.752
* Well, I know *

25:15.820 --> 25:20.590
* This little chapel on
the boulevard we can go *

25:20.658 --> 25:24.227
* No one will know *

25:24.295 --> 25:27.864
* Come on, girl *

25:27.932 --> 25:29.733
* Who cares if we're trashed? *

25:29.800 --> 25:31.468
* Got a pocket full of cash *

25:31.535 --> 25:33.603
* We can blow *

25:37.608 --> 25:40.310
* And it's on, girl *

25:40.378 --> 25:41.828
* Don't say no, no, no, no, no *

25:41.829 --> 25:43.980
* Just say yeah, yeah *

25:45.316 --> 25:46.883
*Yeah, yeah, yeah *

25:46.951 --> 25:49.626
* And we'll go, go, go, go, go *

25:49.726 --> 25:53.695
* If you're ready like I'm ready *

25:53.696 --> 25:56.012
* 'Cause it's a beautiful night *

25:56.013 --> 26:00.030
* We're looking for
something dumb to do *

26:00.097 --> 26:01.983
* Hey, baby *

26:01.984 --> 26:05.001
* I think I wanna marry you *

26:06.648 --> 26:09.136
* ls it the look in your eyes *

26:09.137 --> 26:12.328
?Or is it this dancing juice?

26:12.994 --> 26:14.716
* Who cares, baby? *

26:14.938 --> 26:17.530
* I think I wanna marry you! *

26:17.531 --> 26:18.625
* Ba, ba, ba, ba... *

26:18.693 --> 26:21.862
* Just say "I do" *

26:21.930 --> 26:24.431
* Oo-oo-ooh... *

26:24.499 --> 26:25.666
* Ba, ba, ba, ba... *

26:25.733 --> 26:28.468
* Tell me right now, baby *

26:28.536 --> 26:32.439
* Tell me right now, baby, baby *

26:32.507 --> 26:34.541
* 'Cause it's a beautiful night *

26:34.609 --> 26:38.445
* We're looking for
something dumb to do *

26:38.513 --> 26:40.447
* Hey, baby *

26:40.515 --> 26:43.050
* I think I wanna marry you *

26:43.117 --> 26:44.318
* Ba, ba, ba, ba... *

26:44.385 --> 26:45.619
* Just say "I do" *

26:45.687 --> 26:47.754
* ls it the look in your eyes *

26:47.822 --> 26:51.159
?Or is it this dancing juice?

26:51.941 --> 26:53.842
* Who cares, baby? *

26:53.843 --> 26:56.415
* I think I wanna marry you. *

27:04.111 --> 27:05.278
Please be seated.

27:06.447 --> 27:08.014
We usually start with a prayer.

27:08.082 --> 27:10.278
But a certain young
wedding planner,

27:10.279 --> 27:12.085
who shall remain nameless,

27:12.152 --> 27:14.786
was afraid that some in
attendance might fall asleep.

27:14.787 --> 27:17.536
So instead, I'm going
to let Burt and Carole

27:17.537 --> 27:21.087
tell you in their own words why
they've invited you here today.

27:22.463 --> 27:25.665
I'm not really known for
having a way with words.

27:25.733 --> 27:28.234
Uh... you know when you're a kid,

27:28.302 --> 27:32.071
adults will tell you
a lot of things.

27:32.139 --> 27:36.576
But one thing they neglect
to mention is how...

27:36.644 --> 27:38.609
sad life can be.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.788
I lost somebody I loved very much.

27:42.097 --> 27:43.302
But Kurt...

27:44.656 --> 27:46.122
he lost his mom.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.754
And that killed me.

27:49.490 --> 27:51.591
Well, we got by, but looking back?

27:51.659 --> 27:54.961
I-I want to apologize
to you, Kurt.

27:55.029 --> 27:59.032
What we were living just...
wasn't living.

27:59.099 --> 28:01.301
You know that saying,
that when God

28:01.368 --> 28:04.304
closes a door, he opens a window?

28:04.371 --> 28:08.775
Well, sometimes out of nowhere,
he'll do you one better,

28:08.842 --> 28:10.743
and he'll kick a whole wall down.

28:12.179 --> 28:15.415
He grabbed me by the shoulders,
and he pointed me

28:15.482 --> 28:17.951
towards this woman right here.

28:18.018 --> 28:21.621
And he said, "There she is.

28:21.689 --> 28:24.313
Go get her."

28:24.756 --> 28:27.691
You're everything, Carole.

28:27.759 --> 28:31.962
Words can't describe you.
You're everything.

28:32.030 --> 28:35.414
And I will love you
till the day I die.

28:36.902 --> 28:38.369
Oh, hey...

28:40.238 --> 28:42.273
I'm lucky.

28:42.340 --> 28:45.676
Most women, when they get married,
they get one man.

28:45.744 --> 28:47.211
I get two.

28:47.279 --> 28:51.182
One of you saved me
from my wardrobe,

28:51.249 --> 28:53.084
the other one just saved me.

28:55.854 --> 28:59.539
Kurt, you are an amazing person.

28:59.833 --> 29:02.827
I'm not only getting a son,
I'm getting a friend.

29:02.894 --> 29:04.161
Finn...

29:04.229 --> 29:06.130
I know you were
resistant at first,

29:06.198 --> 29:08.132
but I am so proud of you.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.601
I've watched you grow into a man.

29:11.603 --> 29:13.304
But I think I'm most proud

29:13.371 --> 29:17.741
that you've become
a brother to Kurt.

29:19.711 --> 29:21.679
We are four people.

29:21.746 --> 29:24.101
Becoming a family.

29:25.951 --> 29:27.251
Okay.

29:30.989 --> 29:32.056
Burt...

29:32.124 --> 29:33.724
Do you take Carole...
? You bet I do!

29:35.760 --> 29:37.328
And do you, Carole,
take this man...?

29:37.395 --> 29:39.971
Oh, yes I do! Yes, I do.

30:00.411 --> 30:03.615
* When marimba rhythms
start to play *

30:03.616 --> 30:07.631
* Dance with me, make me sway *

30:07.632 --> 30:11.379
* Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore *

30:11.468 --> 30:13.059
* Hold me close *

30:13.304 --> 30:15.022
* Sway me more *

30:15.416 --> 30:19.185
* Other dancers may
be on the floor *

30:19.253 --> 30:22.989
* Dear, but my eyes
will see only you *

30:23.057 --> 30:26.926
* Only you have that
magic technique *

30:26.994 --> 30:30.806
* When we sway, I go weak *

30:30.807 --> 30:34.100
* When marimba rhythms
start to play *

30:34.168 --> 30:35.869
* Dance with me *

30:35.936 --> 30:37.971
* Make me sway *

30:38.038 --> 30:42.318
* Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore *

30:42.319 --> 30:43.843
* Hold me close *

30:43.911 --> 30:45.945
* Sway me more *

30:47.581 --> 30:51.055
* Like a flower bending
in the breeze *

30:51.056 --> 30:52.809
* Bend with me *

30:52.810 --> 30:55.656
* Sway with ease *

30:55.657 --> 30:58.825
* When we dance,
you have a way with me *

30:58.893 --> 31:00.193
* Stay with me *

31:00.261 --> 31:04.097
* Sway with me! *

31:11.138 --> 31:14.274
And now, I'd like to introduce

31:14.341 --> 31:16.966
one of the best men: Finn Hudson!

31:19.113 --> 31:20.313
All right? You did good.

31:20.381 --> 31:22.782
It did the trick.

31:22.850 --> 31:25.819
Oh. Thanks.

31:25.886 --> 31:28.054
Hi. Uh, thank you.

31:28.122 --> 31:30.423
Best man.

31:30.491 --> 31:32.659
Right. Uh...

31:32.726 --> 31:34.928
Well, I want to propose
a toast to my mom...

31:34.995 --> 31:38.528
who is so awesome.

31:40.334 --> 31:43.841
I mean... somehow even
without one in the house,

31:43.842 --> 31:46.439
you taught me what
it means to be a man.

31:47.641 --> 31:51.842
In Glee Club, uh,
whenever two of us got together,

31:51.942 --> 31:53.379
we got a nickname.

31:53.447 --> 31:55.248
Rachel and I are Finnchel.

31:55.316 --> 31:57.784
Rachel and Puck were Puckleberry.

31:57.852 --> 32:01.354
And today, a new union was formed.

32:01.422 --> 32:04.791
Furt.

32:04.859 --> 32:06.993
You and me, man.

32:07.061 --> 32:09.295
We're brothers from
another mother.

32:09.363 --> 32:12.521
And quite frankly,
no one else has shown me

32:12.522 --> 32:16.594
as much as you about what
it means to be a man.

32:17.037 --> 32:20.940
And over the past few weeks,
uh, some stuff's gone down.

32:21.008 --> 32:24.310
And I haven't manned
up like I should've.

32:24.378 --> 32:30.167
From now on? No matter what
it costs me, I got your back.

32:31.430 --> 32:33.052
Okay?

32:34.410 --> 32:35.777
Even if it means getting a Slushee

32:35.845 --> 32:37.634
in the face every now and then.

32:39.282 --> 32:42.985
You put this entire wedding
together by yourself, Kurt.

32:45.188 --> 32:46.989
So as a thank you,
I had the Glee Club

32:47.056 --> 32:48.390
put together a little
number in your honor.

32:51.127 --> 32:53.762
You're going to dance
it with me, dude.

33:09.679 --> 33:12.814
* Oh, her eyes,
her eyes make the stars *

33:12.882 --> 33:14.983
* Look like they're not shinin' *

33:15.051 --> 33:16.365
* Her hair, her hair *

33:16.366 --> 33:19.221
* Falls perfectly
without her tryin' *

33:19.288 --> 33:21.923
* She's so beautiful *

33:21.991 --> 33:25.861
* And I tell her every day *

33:25.928 --> 33:27.996
* Oh *

33:28.064 --> 33:29.865
* You know, you know,
you know I'd never *

33:29.932 --> 33:31.667
* Ask you to change *

33:31.734 --> 33:34.436
* If perfect's what
you're searching for *

33:34.504 --> 33:36.505
* Then just stay the same *

33:36.572 --> 33:38.646
* So, don't even bother asking *

33:38.647 --> 33:40.271
* If you look okay *

33:40.272 --> 33:43.278
* You know I'll say *

33:43.346 --> 33:46.014
* When I see your face *

33:46.082 --> 33:48.316
* When I see your face *

33:48.384 --> 33:52.554
* There's not a thing
that I would change *

33:52.622 --> 33:54.723
* 'Cause you're amazing *

33:54.791 --> 33:56.291
* You're amazing *

33:56.359 --> 33:59.961
* Just the way you are *

34:01.964 --> 34:04.166
* And when you smile *

34:04.233 --> 34:05.867
* And when you smile *

34:06.259 --> 34:07.758
* The whole world stops *

34:07.759 --> 34:10.428
* And stares for a while *

34:10.495 --> 34:12.306
* 'Cause, girl, you're amazing *

34:12.308 --> 34:13.697
* You're amazing *

34:13.699 --> 34:17.942
* Just the way you are*

34:19.137 --> 34:22.706
* The way you are... *

34:22.774 --> 34:28.045
* The way you are... *

34:28.112 --> 34:31.248
* Girl, you're amazing *
* You're amazing *

34:31.315 --> 34:34.752
* Just the way you are *

34:36.955 --> 34:41.244
* When I see your face *
* I see your face *

34:41.245 --> 34:45.830
* There's not a thing
that I would change *

34:45.897 --> 34:48.933
* 'Cause you're amazing *
* You're amazing *

34:49.000 --> 34:51.534
* Just the way you are *

34:51.603 --> 34:53.838
* Just the way you are *

34:53.905 --> 34:56.873
* And when you smile *

34:56.942 --> 34:58.309
* When you smile *

34:58.377 --> 35:03.114
* The whole world stops
and stares for a while *

35:03.181 --> 35:06.250
* 'Cause, girl, you're amazing *
* You're amazing *

35:06.318 --> 35:09.220
* Just the way you are *

35:09.287 --> 35:12.123
* Just the way you are *

35:12.190 --> 35:12.957
* Yeah. *

35:23.438 --> 35:25.172
Well, I hope the real wedding

35:25.240 --> 35:27.908
is more exciting
than the rehearsal.

35:27.976 --> 35:29.877
You know what, Jeannie?

35:29.944 --> 35:32.946
There's nothing like
spending time with m'girls.

35:33.014 --> 35:34.464
Then why did you leave us?

35:34.465 --> 35:37.628
I was busy. I was
busy keeping you safe.

35:37.629 --> 35:40.854
Those Nazis, they're nasty people.

35:40.922 --> 35:44.275
You got the illustrated copy of
Mein Kampf I sent you, right?

35:44.276 --> 35:45.189
Yes, I did.

35:45.190 --> 35:47.517
Thank you. You're welcome.

35:49.931 --> 35:53.500
Oh, what in the G.D. Hell?

36:03.442 --> 36:04.885
That's enough.

36:07.115 --> 36:09.018
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered today

36:09.218 --> 36:12.853
to join Sue Sylvester and Sue
Sylvester in holy matrimony.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.254
Jeannie, give me the rings.

36:14.322 --> 36:16.523
This is insane.

36:16.591 --> 36:20.294
Sue, do you take Sue to be
your lawfully wedded spouse?

36:22.063 --> 36:23.564
I do.

36:23.942 --> 36:26.161
And Sue, do you take Sue

36:26.162 --> 36:28.318
to be your lawfully wedded spouse?

36:29.915 --> 36:31.215
I do.

36:34.319 --> 36:36.387
By the power vested
in me by a Web site,

36:36.454 --> 36:39.023
I hereby pronounce
you Sue and Sue.

36:40.091 --> 36:41.625
You may kiss yourself.

36:42.961 --> 36:45.129
I'm sorry.

36:45.197 --> 36:46.830
I'm sorry, but this is crazy.

36:46.898 --> 36:48.132
This whole thing is crazy.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.633
I had my heart

36:49.701 --> 36:52.399
set on singing
during the ceremony!

36:52.400 --> 36:54.909
I don't want to be singing
as you're walking out!

36:54.910 --> 36:57.942
I want to have a special
moment with you girls!

36:58.009 --> 37:00.711
We girls have had lots of
special moments, Mother.

37:00.779 --> 37:01.979
You just weren't there.

37:02.047 --> 37:03.516
I resent that.

37:03.772 --> 37:05.251
And I also resent the fact

37:05.252 --> 37:07.374
that you are keeping
me in the background

37:07.375 --> 37:09.231
at my own daughter's
wedding, which,

37:09.232 --> 37:12.281
I am sorry to say I
still think is bizarre!

37:12.282 --> 37:15.349
You know when I finally
began to like who I am?

37:15.417 --> 37:17.084
When I stopped
trying to please you.

37:17.152 --> 37:20.187
So Jean and I had to learn
how to become our own family,

37:20.255 --> 37:23.324
and you can't just waltz
in here after all this time

37:23.392 --> 37:25.860
and start calling the shots.
You're a bully, Mother.

37:25.928 --> 37:27.194
It's taken till now to realize it,

37:27.262 --> 37:29.484
but you are a bully. I am not!

37:29.485 --> 37:32.333
Mother, I cannot remember
a conversation with you

37:32.401 --> 37:35.503
where I didn't walk away
feeling worse about myself.

37:35.571 --> 37:36.624
Well, you know what, Susan?

37:36.724 --> 37:39.040
I'm disappointed in you.

37:39.107 --> 37:39.826
I'm sorry to say, Mother,

37:39.827 --> 37:41.542
you are no longer
invited to my wedding.

37:41.610 --> 37:42.777
What about my song?

37:42.844 --> 37:44.879
You are welcome to sing
"The Sound of Silence"

37:44.947 --> 37:46.480
in your hotel room right now.

37:48.650 --> 37:50.117
All right.

37:55.891 --> 37:58.233
And to think I was
going to send you

37:58.234 --> 38:00.188
to Israel for your honeymoon.

38:00.388 --> 38:02.335
They love me there.

38:04.138 --> 38:05.971
You look beautiful.

38:06.673 --> 38:08.241
You're beautiful.

38:12.433 --> 38:13.232
Hi.

38:13.300 --> 38:15.161
Arnica twice a day.

38:15.261 --> 38:16.903
It'll help your bruise.

38:16.971 --> 38:18.805
Thanks.

38:18.872 --> 38:21.941
I've been thinking a lot
about what you did for Kurt.

38:22.009 --> 38:23.236
It made a real impact.

38:23.237 --> 38:25.013
I thought the only
impact that was made was

38:25.014 --> 38:27.413
Karofsky's fist impacting my face.

38:27.481 --> 38:29.382
You saw what Finn
did at the wedding.

38:29.450 --> 38:31.951
That was because of you.

38:32.019 --> 38:32.885
We've been talking
this whole time,

38:32.886 --> 38:35.955
and you haven't even noticed
that I'm wearing your ring.

38:37.124 --> 38:39.225
How'd you get that?

38:39.293 --> 38:41.027
I broke into your locker.

38:41.095 --> 38:43.696
I've always been really
handy with a nail file.

38:43.764 --> 38:45.465
Really? Mm-hmm.

38:55.943 --> 38:57.644
This is absolutely unacceptable.

38:57.711 --> 38:59.646
This psycho threatens
my kid's life,

38:59.713 --> 39:02.582
and some school board made up of
a bunch of people I've never met

39:02.650 --> 39:04.584
tells me there's nothing
they can do about it?

39:04.652 --> 39:06.085
Oh, they could do
something about it.

39:06.153 --> 39:07.320
They just decided not to.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.689
No one reported witnessing
him being violent,

39:09.757 --> 39:11.424
and there's no way to prove

39:11.492 --> 39:12.992
that he threatened
you with violence.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.661
The school board president
issued a verbal warning

39:14.728 --> 39:17.163
to Karofsky,
and that's where we stand.

39:17.231 --> 39:19.332
I can't go back to being
terrified all the time.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.434
I jump every time a
locker slams shut.

39:21.502 --> 39:23.036
I flinch whenever
I turn the corner.

39:23.103 --> 39:25.004
I don't feel safe at the school.

39:25.072 --> 39:27.774
Kids who bully, for the most part,

39:27.841 --> 39:29.208
have been bullied themselves.

39:29.276 --> 39:30.576
And I for one don't flatter myself

39:30.644 --> 39:32.745
that that behavior can change.

39:32.813 --> 39:35.048
Now this kid Karofsky isn't
gonna all of a sudden

39:35.115 --> 39:37.383
be nice to you,
and I won't stand by

39:37.451 --> 39:39.185
unable to do anything about it.

39:39.253 --> 39:43.189
Effective noon tomorrow,
Figgins is back in charge

39:43.257 --> 39:46.059
as I've tendered my resignation
as principal in protest.

39:46.126 --> 39:48.695
I can't help you behind that desk,

39:48.762 --> 39:51.130
but I can be an extra pair of
eyes out in those hallways.

39:51.198 --> 39:53.066
Someone ought to have your back.

39:53.133 --> 39:56.169
Besides, I miss my office.
This room smells weird.

39:56.236 --> 39:59.172
I can't shake the feeling that
I'm inhaling a lot of dead skin.

40:02.810 --> 40:05.712
Well, I guess I'll try to
enjoy the rest of the day,

40:05.779 --> 40:07.180
before the terror starts anew.

40:07.247 --> 40:08.748
I'll see you at home.

40:10.718 --> 40:13.386
Hey, Kurt. Wait up a second.
There's something

40:13.454 --> 40:15.033
we want to talk to you about.

40:15.955 --> 40:18.316
Come on, guys.
The wedding was great,

40:18.317 --> 40:21.160
but we have got to get ready
for Sectionals next week.

40:21.385 --> 40:24.878
Kurt, good, I want to talk to
you about this amazing idea

40:24.879 --> 40:26.903
I had for a solo for
you at Sectionals.

40:26.904 --> 40:28.304
Can I make an announcement first?

40:28.372 --> 40:29.297
Yeah.

40:30.007 --> 40:32.809
First, I wanted to thank
everyone for what you did

40:32.877 --> 40:35.245
at my dad's wedding,
especially Finn.

40:35.312 --> 40:37.614
It's nice to know that I
have great friends here

40:37.681 --> 40:40.617
as well as a true brother.

40:40.684 --> 40:43.419
Which is why it's so
hard for me to leave.

40:44.788 --> 40:46.956
What do you mean, "Leave?"

40:47.024 --> 40:51.453
I'm transferring to Dalton
Academy... immediately.

40:52.263 --> 40:54.330
My parents are using
the money they saved up

40:54.398 --> 40:56.966
for their honeymoon to
pay for the tuition.

40:57.034 --> 40:58.701
Kurt, you can't leave.

40:58.769 --> 41:00.303
What the hell, dude?

41:00.371 --> 41:02.272
How about you talk with
me about this first?

41:02.339 --> 41:05.441
I'm sorry, Finn, but there's
nothing to talk about.

41:05.509 --> 41:06.676
Karofsky's coming back tomorrow,

41:06.744 --> 41:08.511
so that means I won't be.

41:08.579 --> 41:10.647
We can protect you.
Seriously, we can, like,

41:10.714 --> 41:12.448
form a perimeter around you
like the Secret Service.

41:12.516 --> 41:13.716
Yeah. The only thing

41:13.784 --> 41:15.094
that can really protect
me is what they have

41:15.095 --> 41:20.098
a zero tolerance, no-
bullying policy. It's enforced.
