00:01.960 --> 00:03.417
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.504 --> 00:05.496
<i>I now pronounce you
husband and wife.</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:08.289
I think it's time you introduce
these guys to your mean roommate.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.091
Tell Amunet I'm done.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.051
Nobody walks away from me, Frost.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.550
So, you think DeVoe and his wife
are supervillains?

00:15.766 --> 00:16.802
<i>Who are you, really?</i>

00:16.892 --> 00:19.555
<i>I was born
on the same evening you were.</i>

00:20.521 --> 00:22.262
I know every answer
to every question ever asked.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.431
Incredible. Clifford!

00:24.691 --> 00:27.479
<i>Your body's deteriorating
faster than the chair can handle.</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:29.526
It will survive long enough.

00:36.495 --> 00:37.485
What are you doing?

00:38.914 --> 00:39.904
Tinsel.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.911
Your tinsel-to-surface ratio
is terrible.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.454
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.663
I've done extensive research
to make sure that this tinsel

00:47.756 --> 00:49.418
is properly proportioned for this tree.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.090
- It's terrible.
- "It's terrible"?

00:51.176 --> 00:52.257
- I'll tell you what's terrible.
- What?

00:52.344 --> 00:53.676
Your Scrooge-to-Grinch
ratio is terrible.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.470
You're a mean one. I wouldn't touch you
with a 39-and-a-half foot pole.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.173
- Haven't heard that one before.
- Yeah.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.849
Hey, Cisco. Where's Gypsy?

00:59.935 --> 01:04.099
She had to work the holiday shift,
but I think I got her the perfect gift.

01:04.188 --> 01:07.933
A Gulag-class mech knife
forged in the unholy blood-fires

01:08.026 --> 01:10.268
of Earth-22 by none other than

01:10.362 --> 01:11.728
- Wells 2.0.
- Wells 2.0.

01:12.197 --> 01:15.190
Of course, Gypsy should've
sent something for me by now.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.403
Awkward.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.025
I'm sure it's fine.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.110
Yikes.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.321
Did Rudolph
just diarrhea all over your tree?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.702
Cool. Cool. Two humbugs.
It's a Festivus miracle.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.704
No, don't get me wrong.
Ralphy loves Christmas.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.626
I ring in every holiday season
with my nana.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.921
<i>She never remembers me but I am getting
that inheritance.</i>

01:30.674 --> 01:32.336
You are just incorrect.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.626
<i>If you don't want to spend Christmas
conning your grandma,</i>

01:34.886 --> 01:38.971
you're more than welcome to join
your friends at the West family party.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.053
Extremely obvious. I saw that.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.009
And, by the way,
that sounds like a snooze fest.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.930
Unless, of course,
you're serving baking soda!

01:47.190 --> 01:49.398
Baking soda!

01:50.611 --> 01:52.568
What... Sorry, what's that about?

01:52.821 --> 01:55.655
Well, it's a bit of an inside joke.

01:55.741 --> 01:58.484
- Actually, concerning Killer Frost.
- Classic Killer Frost.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.611
You guys were
hanging out with Killer Frost?

02:01.705 --> 02:02.695
Oh, yeah.

02:02.789 --> 02:03.870
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.409
I hope you had a great time.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.788
We had the best time.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.957
I mean, you're great, Snow Cone,
but my girl Frostbite...

02:12.132 --> 02:13.122
Come on.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.542
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.545
- Caitlin.
- Caitlin.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.050
Hey, if you see my girl
K-Frost later,

02:20.307 --> 02:23.015
tell her what I said
about the baking soda.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.059
- Dibny.
- Too much?

02:31.777 --> 02:35.691
Okay. From Oliver and Felicity...

02:36.615 --> 02:40.734
We have an espresso machine. All right.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.527
Okay, not on the registry.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.783
But I guess getting married

02:44.873 --> 02:46.330
during our wedding
wasn't on the registry either.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.329
- So, yeah, sure. I'm not bitter.
- All right.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.544
I'll put this in the return pile.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.872
Well, I guess that's everything.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.547
No, we got one more.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.841
There's no card.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.418
Um...

03:00.013 --> 03:01.879
Great, it's another set of knives.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.683
It's not even a full set.
Yeah, it's one knife.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.601
- That's just shoddy gifting.
- Let me see.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.011
I'm gonna clean up.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.652
So, what, no speed cleaning today?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.562
No, we're not in a rush.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.741
Barry, you barely
used your powers in Bali, either.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.238
I mean,
not even to put on suntan lotion.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.156
It was a spray-on bottle.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.159
What is going on, Barr?

03:27.624 --> 03:28.956
Nothing.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.494
I mean, I don't know.
I have been thinking recently that...

03:34.631 --> 03:38.375
You know, when I first got my powers,
I would use any excuse to use them.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.959
<i>It would just be me and the road</i>

03:40.053 --> 03:41.794
and everything around me
would disappear.

03:42.806 --> 03:46.846
It's like the first time in my life
I really felt like I was at peace.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.601
<i>I just...</i>

03:49.354 --> 03:51.220
Feel like that all the time now.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.768
I don't have to run when I'm with you.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.517
Aw.

03:57.821 --> 03:58.937
So sweet.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.316
I love you, Iris West Allen.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.318
I love you, too.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.463
Let me.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.553
The atrophy of my fine
motor skills is accelerating.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.813
I'm so sorry, my love.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.144
The pain is but fleeting.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.480
- After all, today is the day.
- How fitting.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.366
You'll share a birthday
with the Messiah.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.496
The Nazarene wasn't born until spring.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.620
<i>You can check the constellation patterns
to verify that.</i>

04:57.881 --> 05:00.214
You've heard this lecture before,
haven't you?

05:01.384 --> 05:02.420
Maybe.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.382
But I will never grow tired
of hearing your voice.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.801
The words are still mine
even if the voice isn't.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.856
Do you have any doubts?

05:17.651 --> 05:20.519
No, of course not.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.986
It will just take some getting used to.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.743
Don't be afraid, my love.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.206
This is the great work.

05:42.717 --> 05:47.212
I swear,
I will stand beside you in your time.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.272
Ho, ho, ho!

06:04.155 --> 06:05.612
<i>Well, let's see...</i>

06:06.491 --> 06:08.699
Dark roast. The light roast...

06:08.785 --> 06:11.448
What are you having,
the self-pity roast?

06:11.538 --> 06:12.699
I wish.

06:14.916 --> 06:18.751
- "The Killer Frost."
- Finally got a drink. Woo-hoo.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.454
I'm thrilled that she helped everybody
fight the Reichsmen,

06:21.548 --> 06:23.540
but now it's like I can't escape her.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.625
Everybody keeps saying,
"Killer Frost is so funny.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.051
"Killer Frost is so badass."

06:27.137 --> 06:29.345
I spent so long worried
that she was gonna hurt people.

06:29.681 --> 06:33.675
But now, turns out people would rather
hang out with my villainous alter-ego.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.476
Look, I...

06:36.313 --> 06:38.771
I get it. I know what it's like
to have the evil doppelganger,

06:38.857 --> 06:40.644
but you're not like me anyways.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.478
No, you're different. You're special.

06:44.946 --> 06:50.613
And your friends would much rather
be with you than with her.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.947
- Thanks, Harry.
- You're welcome.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.760
Ho, ho, ho.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.806
This is like a lifetime supply
of store credit.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.350
Why would Rory think that
we needed 40 toasters?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.769
He said that there was some
kind of fire sale...

07:19.522 --> 07:21.684
- He stole them. Yeah.
- He definitely stole them.

07:27.864 --> 07:28.980
Barry!

07:33.578 --> 07:34.819
Caity!

07:34.913 --> 07:36.779
- That's Amunet.
- Hide. Hide. Hide.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.626
I blocked your Glock.

07:45.340 --> 07:49.175
Hello, Iris. My deepest congratulations
on your wedding.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.187
No, no, no, dear.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.066
Frosty melted away.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.940
I've come for you, Caity.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.943
- You okay?
- Yeah.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.319
I'll be right back.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.078
Barry!

08:31.011 --> 08:34.095
DeVoe. He attacked us on the street.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.511
- He took Barry.
- What?

08:35.974 --> 08:37.885
- Are you kidding me?
- What happened to you?

08:37.976 --> 08:40.183
Amunet Black abducted Caitlin.

08:40.311 --> 08:43.099
Two people go missing at the same time.
That's quite a coinky-dink.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.226
Yeah, that's a great observation,
Captain Obvious.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.683
Can you set the satellite
to look for Caitlin's cryokinetic energy

08:47.777 --> 08:49.393
or Barry's Speed Force signatures?

08:49.487 --> 08:51.399
No. No.
We've got to look for both of them.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.823
Cisco, I need you to vibe Barry.
I need to know that he's alive.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.657
Holy poltergeist.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.167
Hey. Are you okay?

09:05.253 --> 09:08.587
Yeah, I'm just not gonna be vibing again
for a while.

09:08.673 --> 09:09.663
What about Allen?

09:10.300 --> 09:14.965
Wherever he is,
I've never experienced anything like it.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.028
Hello?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.260
Here we are.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.553
Really moving up in the world.

10:06.773 --> 10:11.814
You know, a sprinkle of enthusiasm
would not kill you.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.519
Listen, Amunet,
whatever it is you have planned,

10:13.780 --> 10:16.397
I guarantee you Killer Frost
wants nothing to do with it.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.984
It's all right, darling.
I don't need her. I need you.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.448
Meet your patient.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.908
What have you done?

10:28.169 --> 10:31.003
There's no need to be overdramatic.
He's alive.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.004
And I'm sure he'd be happy to meet you,

10:33.091 --> 10:36.129
just as soon
as that tranquilizer wears off.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.051
Why do you have him? What is he to you?

10:38.263 --> 10:40.425
My golden goose.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.802
You see, Dominic here
is a delightful new meta

10:43.017 --> 10:45.634
that I "found."

10:46.354 --> 10:48.346
And I'd intended on selling him,

10:48.439 --> 10:51.523
but unfortunately, he did not want to
go so gently into the good night.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.770
And...

10:56.114 --> 10:57.696
- I shot him.
- That is...

10:57.782 --> 11:00.274
In desperate need of medical attention.
I know.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.902
And now you know
why I need you, Caity, MD.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.612
You're talking about an intricate

11:04.706 --> 11:06.242
cranial foreign body
retraction, at best.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.448
At worst, that's an...

11:07.542 --> 11:08.749
I'm gonna stop you there

11:08.835 --> 11:10.872
'cause I have absolutely no idea
what you're saying.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.705
But, you see, it does not matter.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.007
Because I knew that you would understand
what needed to happen.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.670
Amunet, I won't. I can't.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.507
This environment isn't sterilized,
the equipment is ancient.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.479
I suppose I could
just yank it out myself.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.603
And risk him bleeding out
or a dozen other brain deficits.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.276
Right. Good point.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.737
Well, there's only one way to find out.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.944
No. No.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.405
I'll do what I can.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.746
Excellent.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.542
Oh! I almost forgot.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.461
Should he die,

11:55.298 --> 11:56.288
you die as well.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.090
This Killer Frost iced mocha
is really delicious.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.816
Hello, Mr. Allen.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.453
Not exactly S.T.A.R. Labs.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.832
- Who are you?
- My name is Caitlin Snow,

12:36.005 --> 12:38.748
and you're in St. Andrew's Hospital.
At least, I think that's where we are.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.673
This place has been closed down
for a while.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.377
Please, you have to help me
get out of here.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.928
Easier said than done.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.681
That blonde lady, she took you, too?

12:49.936 --> 12:52.474
God, I don't understand
why this is happening to us.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.063
Dominic, do you know
what a meta-human is?

12:56.025 --> 12:58.062
Listen, I didn't do anything wrong.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.984
- I didn't rob a bank or something.
- No, I know.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.609
People with abilities, people like you,

13:02.824 --> 13:05.612
they're a commodity, especially...

13:05.702 --> 13:06.909
Especially to Amunet.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.404
Yeah.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.248
Listen, I'm gonna be honest with you.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.543
It would be very difficult to fix
what she did to you,

13:16.629 --> 13:19.622
even under the best of circumstances
with the right equipment.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.174
But I feel fine.
My head doesn't even hurt.

13:22.260 --> 13:26.220
Which is a minor miracle.
But if that shard were to fracture...

13:26.306 --> 13:29.640
It could cause permanent motor skills
or permanent brain deficits.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.351
How did you...

13:35.189 --> 13:36.976
You have telepathic abilities.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.441
Can you hear
what I'm thinking right now?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.319
When did I get my powers?

13:43.531 --> 13:44.897
A couple months ago.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.569
I took the bus to my job
at the airport. TSA.

13:49.787 --> 13:50.903
<i>But when I got there,</i>

13:50.997 --> 13:54.365
it was like everyone was yelling at me,
screaming mad,

13:54.584 --> 13:55.870
but their mouths weren't moving.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.581
It only works when I'm close enough
to see someone.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.669
You don't think
we're getting out of here?

14:04.344 --> 14:06.176
I'm gonna do
everything I can to fix you,

14:06.846 --> 14:08.633
but I can't get you away from her.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.506
Not on my own.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.091
<i>Caitlin.</i>

14:13.311 --> 14:14.597
I'm scared, too.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.560
Wow.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.982
What an entrance.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.938
So, where are we?

14:23.488 --> 14:25.104
This is your sanctuary?

14:25.782 --> 14:27.148
What gave that away?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.820
DeVoe, if you wanted to kill me,

14:29.911 --> 14:32.870
you could have just electrocuted me
on the street. So...

14:34.082 --> 14:35.198
I'm here for a reason.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.829
Yes, Mr. Allen.
So that I may teach you.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.287
I am, after all,
first and foremost a teacher.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.039
God.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.970
All right. Fine. Teach me.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.305
<i>But first I wanna make sure
I'm all caught up.</i>

14:52.558 --> 14:55.722
You sent your Samuroid after me.

14:56.521 --> 15:00.561
You arranged to pull me
out of the Speed Force.

15:01.192 --> 15:05.357
You made sure that we turned
all those people on that bus

15:05.446 --> 15:07.062
into meta-humans.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.071
Why?

15:09.158 --> 15:13.493
You see, the finer points of my agenda
are not part of today's syllabus.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.661
Come on. We can squeeze it in.
I'm a fast learner.

15:15.748 --> 15:20.789
Please. You're about as capable
of seeing the breadth of my machinations

15:20.878 --> 15:23.996
as an infant mastering
multivariable physics.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.419
Well...

15:26.634 --> 15:29.001
But the lesson I have prepped for today
is much more simple.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.548
<i>Life 101.</i>

15:32.890 --> 15:34.927
There are no happy endings.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.976
<i>Oh.</i>

15:38.521 --> 15:39.511
We have a guest.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.362
DeVoe...

15:48.448 --> 15:52.158
You should learn to lose
every once in a while, Barr.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.493
A little humility will prepare you
for what lies ahead.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.163
Now, if you will excuse me.

15:58.958 --> 15:59.948
DeVoe!

16:00.710 --> 16:04.374
If you hurt him...
If you put a hand on him...

16:04.589 --> 16:06.171
DeVoe!

16:06.382 --> 16:07.714
DeVoe!

16:12.221 --> 16:13.632
<i>It's open.</i>

16:17.602 --> 16:19.138
Good evening, Detective West.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.644
Now, something tells me

16:20.730 --> 16:22.813
you're not here for more
of my wife's world-famous lemonade.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.106
Where's my son?

16:25.735 --> 16:28.227
Mr. Allen? Has he gone missing?

16:28.321 --> 16:32.110
He's not missing. He was taken.
By someone I am eager to meet.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.776
Thinly-veiled threats aside, Mr. West,

16:35.953 --> 16:39.037
I'm afraid I have not a clue
as to Barry Allen's location.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.992
I do know, however, that your colleague
is located behind my front porch,

16:43.085 --> 16:46.544
carrying an ionic subrepeating
pulse firearm.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.509
But the birdbath
it's a much better vantage point.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.382
A smart man
would've taken up position there.

16:54.931 --> 16:58.140
A smarter man would understand
that this gun has no safety

16:58.226 --> 17:00.013
and my finger is still on the trigger.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.479
Is there something you find funny?

17:04.857 --> 17:08.146
Well, it has occurred to me that
there is an amusing irony at play,

17:08.236 --> 17:10.068
you being a detective and all,

17:10.320 --> 17:11.857
yet you fail to acknowledge

17:12.073 --> 17:14.611
the most basic result
in missing-children cases.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.691
And what would that be?

17:17.203 --> 17:20.445
Perhaps your son just ran away.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.372
- Joe...
- Now, I do have

17:22.458 --> 17:24.619
a restraining order against your son.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.084
Shall I add you to the list?

17:26.170 --> 17:27.455
If something happened to Barry,

17:27.547 --> 17:30.631
there ain't a restraining order on Earth
that would keep me from getting you.

17:32.093 --> 17:35.336
- I'm coming back with a search warrant.
- Completely unnecessary, Detective.

17:35.429 --> 17:39.013
If you desire to search my abode,

17:39.350 --> 17:40.431
by all means.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.066
- You're not as smart as you think.
- Yes, I am.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.991
You're only hurting yourself.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.875
Running faster than sound,
vibrating through walls,

18:11.090 --> 18:12.581
even throwing lightning...

18:13.551 --> 18:15.759
None of that can destroy this barrier.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.173
You know a lot about my abilities.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.684
Is that why I'm here?

18:26.480 --> 18:27.812
DeVoe wants my powers?

18:31.360 --> 18:32.601
You don't have to do this.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.982
Whatever he has planned,
you don't have to help him.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.941
A helper. Is that what you think I am?

18:39.535 --> 18:42.824
A mindless minion
carrying out her master's bidding?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.363
Some sort of evil secretary?

18:44.582 --> 18:45.618
You tell me.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.574
No, Mr. Allen.

18:47.793 --> 18:53.289
I am now, and forever will be,
my husband's partner.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.334
I understand that.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.760
You're not the only one

18:58.846 --> 19:01.429
who promised to stand by your loved one
for better or for worse.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.675
In sickness and in health.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.264
<i>If you go down this path with DeVoe,</i>

19:07.355 --> 19:11.019
can't you see that you risk sacrificing
everything that you have together?

19:11.359 --> 19:12.440
Your entire marriage.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.518
You're missing the point.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.195
I am willing to sacrifice everything
for my marriage.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.365
I'd ask if you could do the same,
but there's no need.

19:21.535 --> 19:22.946
My husband already knows.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.779
His body may be human,

19:26.457 --> 19:28.790
but his brain is smarter than yours.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.220
- Zark me!
- What happened?

19:43.057 --> 19:46.050
Well, the satellite's trying to search
for Barry's Speed Force energy

19:46.143 --> 19:47.975
and Caitlin's cryokinetic signature,

19:48.062 --> 19:50.019
so the bandwidth limiters
are overheating.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.060
Well, that's what you get
when you rely on machines

19:53.150 --> 19:54.561
rather than a master private eye.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.484
I've had a ton a missing-person cases.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.819
There was this wife once,

19:57.905 --> 20:00.522
turns out she faked her own death,
she was just living in Arizona.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.408
Are you saying Barry faked his own death
and moved to Arizona?

20:04.245 --> 20:05.577
Well, no.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.112
Well, then shut up.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.279
Oh, boy.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.116
Tell me you got something.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.747
Got nothing.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.669
<i>Searched the DeVoe house thoroughly.
It's clean.</i>

20:15.339 --> 20:17.956
Your father's gone to check the scene
from where Barry was taken.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.175
You know,
there was this other case once.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.004
A woman couldn't find her husband.
Turns out she just had amnesia.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.721
He was home,
she just didn't recognize him.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.719
And I still got paid. Twice.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.015
Ralph.

20:28.394 --> 20:32.559
Please, shut up.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.857
You got something
you wanna say to me, Ramon?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.059
Yeah.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.819
Yeah, I got something to say to you,
Ralphy boy.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.696
Caitlin's been kidnapped.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.445
Of course, she wouldn't have been
at Jitters in the first place

20:44.535 --> 20:46.527
if you hadn't acted
like such a jackass today

20:46.662 --> 20:49.279
but of course,
in true Ralph Dibny fashion,

20:49.373 --> 20:51.535
you drove her away with your fat mouth!

20:51.625 --> 20:53.992
Maybe I should turn my hand
into a fat fist?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.918
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey, guys, cool it.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.330
Listen, the people we love are in danger

20:58.424 --> 20:59.881
and you two can't get it together?

21:00.843 --> 21:01.879
Really?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.043
Whatever.

21:04.805 --> 21:05.795
I'll be in my lab.

21:08.058 --> 21:11.096
And I will be in whatever room
is farthest from that.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.268
Speed lab.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.141
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.562
- What is wrong with those two?
- You.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.236
Excuse me?

21:26.243 --> 21:27.233
You're what's wrong.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.943
You are the team leader.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.405
Team leader is supposed
to make the tough call.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.992
I made a call. I said we would look
for both of them.

21:35.085 --> 21:38.169
No. Looking for both of them
is not a choice.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.087
We're overtaxing our resources,
our people,

21:40.174 --> 21:41.710
<i>because you won't face the hard truth.</i>

21:41.801 --> 21:43.793
And the hard truth is
we can't look for both.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.964
We can only look for one.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.803
Harry, I just made a vow

21:51.769 --> 21:54.853
to love and protect Barry,
to stand by him through thick and thin.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.396
And now you're asking me to choose

21:56.482 --> 21:58.439
between my husband's life
and my friend's?

21:59.610 --> 22:01.602
- I can't do that.
- You have to.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.029
Or you risk losing them both.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.200
You have to choose.

22:21.006 --> 22:21.996
Damn it.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.592
Who's Killer Frost?

22:27.721 --> 22:30.464
Sorry. She's just on your mind a lot,

22:30.724 --> 22:31.760
with a lot of cursing.

22:33.811 --> 22:37.100
She is my meta-power.

22:37.398 --> 22:39.355
Whenever I get scared or angry
she takes over.

22:39.441 --> 22:43.310
She is violent and dangerous
and unpredictable

22:43.404 --> 22:46.272
but she's a whole lot more useful
than I am.

22:46.407 --> 22:47.614
No, thanks.

22:48.576 --> 22:51.034
I'm already scared to death
of one psychotic woman.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.452
I'll take my chances with you.

22:55.833 --> 22:59.076
Dominic, I'm sorry, it's too risky
to perform this surgery here.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.245
<i>And I don't have
any powers to save us...</i>

23:02.673 --> 23:03.959
But you do.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.060
<i>Take a right.</i>

23:23.485 --> 23:24.566
Caitlin, get back.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.539
Somebody's made my naughty list.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.844
Gentlemen, can you please
take Dominic in?

23:58.938 --> 24:01.521
I need to have a word
with Caity in private.

24:05.319 --> 24:06.560
Thank you.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.695
Why can't you just appreciate
how nice I've been to you?

24:13.410 --> 24:15.367
I don't think you understand
the meaning of the word "nice."

24:15.454 --> 24:18.322
Now, now. It's not about words,
it's about actions.

24:18.415 --> 24:21.374
And I have not stabbed you
or punched you

24:21.460 --> 24:23.497
or shot a deadly piece of metal
at you once.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.120
Today.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.207
So why did you run away from me?

24:30.886 --> 24:33.253
Tried. Tried and failed.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.051
Killer Frost
would have been able to do it.

24:37.935 --> 24:38.971
Ah.

24:40.771 --> 24:41.761
I see.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.018
Caity, do you know what I was doing

24:45.109 --> 24:48.648
before I became the successful
entrepreneur you see before you today?

24:50.322 --> 24:52.234
Mean British nanny?

24:52.992 --> 24:53.982
No.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.489
I was a stewardess.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.488
You see, unlike you, I did not have
fancy scientists for parents.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.289
<i>I did not collect scholarships</i>

25:02.418 --> 25:03.875
or attend fine institutions.

25:04.336 --> 25:08.330
My career options were limited.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.966
So I spent my days
in a quaint little skirt and vest,

25:12.052 --> 25:14.920
serving coffee to handsy pilots,
powerless to stop them.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.015
But then,
the particle accelerator exploded

25:20.352 --> 25:23.686
and I was powerless no more.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.109
I showed those pilots
the error of their ways.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.366
Why are you telling me this?

25:36.452 --> 25:40.867
Because obtaining my powers
is quite literally what made me me.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.492
But the same cannot be said about you.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.284
There are any number of doctors
I could have come to for this procedure.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.706
I did not. I came to you.

25:47.880 --> 25:54.628
Because you, Caitlin Snow, are
and have always been remarkable.

25:57.181 --> 26:01.596
You are bright, resourceful, resilient.

26:02.478 --> 26:05.642
And I am more than certain
you can do this.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.441
<i>So, with that said,</i>

26:10.527 --> 26:13.110
unless you want to spend the rest
of your medical career in the morgue,

26:13.197 --> 26:14.813
I suggest you buck up, darling.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.277
You know, pull on your big-girl pants

26:17.868 --> 26:19.109
and do the bloody thing.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.532
Find Caitlin and Barry.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.125
Come on, you bum.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.409
Do it.

26:28.921 --> 26:29.911
Do it!

26:30.089 --> 26:31.421
Are you yelling at my satellite?

26:32.800 --> 26:34.507
No, I was just encouraging it.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.673
Although, Sally here
clearly doesn't wanna be encouraged.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.305
Okay, one, her name isn't Sally.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.422
Two...

26:43.519 --> 26:44.509
I'm sorry.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.892
Barry and Caitlin,
we've lost them both before,

26:48.607 --> 26:51.190
and it just feels like
we just got them back.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.190
So, sorry I was a dick.

26:54.780 --> 26:55.816
You weren't a dick.

26:56.365 --> 26:57.355
I'm the dick.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.065
Private and public.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.075
<i>You were just being honest.</i>

27:01.537 --> 27:04.245
If it wasn't for me, Caitlin would be
right here with you, me and Sally.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.412
Not "Sally."

27:05.499 --> 27:08.958
The truth is,
I haven't had friends in a while.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.286
I'm sure you find that hard to believe,

27:11.380 --> 27:13.121
given my good looks
and winning personality.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.376
Mmm-hmm.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.458
But I'm out of practice.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.422
I suck at being a friend.

27:20.514 --> 27:23.257
<i>Now Christmas is ruined,
everyone is kidnapped,</i>

27:24.518 --> 27:25.679
and it's all my fault.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.264
You're here.

27:27.813 --> 27:28.849
And you're helping.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.644
Caitlin's in a vulnerable
state right now

27:37.781 --> 27:38.988
and Barry can take care of himself.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.111
So let's turn off
the Speed Force satellite.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.325
We're going after Caitlin.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.323
We're on it.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.333
Let's go get our girl.

27:55.716 --> 27:57.753
<i>I used some equipment
that I found in the basement</i>

27:57.843 --> 28:00.711
to jerry-rig an MRI machine
so that I don't hit an artery.

28:01.763 --> 28:02.753
Now that's ingenuity.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.386
You know, I knew
you were the right doctor to kidnap.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.931
This is a very delicate procedure.
Do you mind giving me some space?

28:09.104 --> 28:10.811
Right. Sorry.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.272
I'll just... I'm gonna leave this
right here.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.484
You know, medical insurance and all.

28:16.862 --> 28:17.852
Great.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.606
- Ready?
- I trust you.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.159
Now I need you to hold still.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.329
You're gonna feel some pressure.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.795
Extracting the foreign object.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.726
Foreign object extracted.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.646
Applying some surgical glue.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.857
- He's going into shock.
- So un-shock him.

29:03.951 --> 29:04.941
I don't know if I can.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.083
That is not the rhythmic tone
of a steady heartbeat.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.130
I need to hear a beep-beep-beep, dearie,

29:20.217 --> 29:22.630
or Dominic won't be
the only flatliner in the room.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.005
Oh.

29:31.061 --> 29:32.177
Oh, you're good.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.269
We're clear.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.018
They're all out.

29:41.154 --> 29:44.318
Forty psi of inhalation anesthetic,
that'll keep 'em out, but not for long.

29:44.866 --> 29:45.902
Let's go.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.237
Satellite's pinging
Caitlin's latent cryokinetic signature.

29:50.789 --> 29:51.779
Where is she?

29:53.500 --> 29:56.459
East wing of St. Alexander Hospital.
That place has been closed for years.

29:56.545 --> 29:58.036
We'll breach over. You got your suit?

29:58.547 --> 29:59.708
Never leave home without it.

30:02.592 --> 30:03.582
Caitlin!

30:05.053 --> 30:07.921
Damn it! I was aiming for your head.

30:17.607 --> 30:20.224
So pointy! That is not very nice, lady.

30:24.114 --> 30:25.525
Are you a time traveler?

30:25.824 --> 30:28.191
'Cause those white-girl dreads
came straight from the '90s.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.913
Yeah, what he said.

30:39.463 --> 30:41.045
Although, if you wanna give me
your phone number

30:41.131 --> 30:42.292
we could Netflix and chill...

30:51.308 --> 30:52.344
Impossible.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.427
<i>Well, that's the thing.</i>

30:56.563 --> 30:57.644
I am the impossible.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.692
We built that cell
so you couldn't run your way out.

31:04.154 --> 31:05.144
I didn't run.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.860
I just stood still really fast.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.737
You vibrated faster
than the eye can process.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.072
Like your wife said,

31:12.412 --> 31:16.372
your brain may be smarter than mine,
but your body is still human.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.282
It's over, DeVoe.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.292
Far from it, Mr. Allen.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.677
<i>Flotation mode, activated.</i>

32:29.865 --> 32:31.572
Life raft was a good call, Cisco.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.207
Barry!

32:56.558 --> 32:57.639
There's no sign of DeVoe.

32:57.767 --> 33:01.056
The house is empty. Facial recognition
is not picking up him or his wife.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.182
So, what, he just drowned?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.021
Or he went back
to wherever he was holding Barry.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.139
Why do you think he took you?

33:05.525 --> 33:08.689
I'm not sure, but I think
that he's interested in my powers.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.572
Great. We've got evil Mary Poppins
collecting metas, too.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.824
Yeah, and Amunet won't back down.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.527
Nothing like a lingering threat
to put us all in the Christmas spirit.

33:17.621 --> 33:20.284
Speaking of which, with all this DeVoe
stuff and Cecile being out of town,

33:20.373 --> 33:21.864
<i>I didn't have a chance
to decorate the house.</i>

33:22.292 --> 33:24.329
Do you guys still wanna do Christmas?

33:24.544 --> 33:26.661
Yeah, of course,
we have a lot to celebrate.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.414
Do you mind if I invite Dominic,
that meta we just saved?

33:29.508 --> 33:30.589
The more the merrier.

33:30.675 --> 33:31.711
Let's get some nog.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.428
So, everything worked out, huh?

33:38.141 --> 33:39.257
Yeah, but what if it didn't?

33:40.519 --> 33:42.932
What if he killed you
because of a decision that I made?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.515
Honestly, Barry, I don't know
if I can keep doing this.

33:46.608 --> 33:50.352
Hey, Wells told me about the tough call
you had to make yesterday.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.231
You're gonna have to make
a lot more in the future.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.813
But you made the right call.

33:54.574 --> 33:55.985
And I'm proud of you for making it.

33:58.703 --> 33:59.693
So what now?

33:59.913 --> 34:02.405
Now we have ourselves
a merry little Christmas.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.074
- Let's go.
- Okay.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.208
- What the...
- Wow.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.252
Ho, ho, ho. Oh.

34:16.721 --> 34:17.802
Wait.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.299
Like a bowl full of jelly.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.012
Ralph, what is all this?

34:23.228 --> 34:25.219
Well, Joe said
he didn't have any time to decorate

34:25.938 --> 34:28.056
and I wanted to do something nice

34:28.650 --> 34:30.312
for my friends.

34:31.110 --> 34:34.070
I realize that I don't usually say
or do the right thing.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.147
So I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.159
Well, you really went all out,
Ralph, thanks.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.077
It looks great, man, thank you.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.491
I'm glad you like it.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.743
Oh, wow.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.074
Uh, Caitlin.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.503
It was wrong of me to say
that Killer Frost is better than you.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.871
Because the truth is

34:55.010 --> 34:56.045
no one is better than you.

34:56.803 --> 34:57.793
Thank you.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.637
And I know, I'm the one
who saved the day this time.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.222
You know, Cisco, a gift came for you

35:02.309 --> 35:04.016
through one of those death holes
that you call a breach.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.218
Oh, well...

35:05.729 --> 35:07.470
Looks like Gypsy came through, I guess.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.355
- Um...
- Wait.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.020
This is a breakup cube.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.851
I thought things were going so well
with you and Gypsy.

35:13.945 --> 35:14.981
That makes two of us.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.154
Ramon, that's not a breakup cube.
You should open that when you're alone.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.948
No, no, no. If she's gonna break up
with me, I wanna hear why.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.487
- No, Ramon, I wouldn't...
<i>- Cisco,</i>

35:21.745 --> 35:24.863
<i>somebody told me you've been
a very naughty boy this year.</i>

35:25.206 --> 35:26.947
<i>Why don't you come over
and jingle my bells, huh?</i>

35:27.042 --> 35:28.158
Sweet baby Jesus.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.288
Told you, not a breakup cube.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.335
<i>...and I promise it's not gonna be...</i>

35:32.422 --> 35:33.412
You use the same button to...

35:36.092 --> 35:39.130
- Joe, do you mind if I...
- Take that to your house.

35:39.429 --> 35:40.419
Yeah.

35:41.348 --> 35:42.384
No Wally?

35:42.807 --> 35:43.888
He couldn't make it.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.308
- He's still in Blue Valley?
- Cambodia.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.556
Dominic, I'm so glad you came.
Come on in.

35:52.651 --> 35:53.687
This is Joe.

35:54.444 --> 35:55.434
Thank you.

35:56.404 --> 35:57.394
This house is...

35:57.572 --> 35:58.779
Bitchin'?

35:59.074 --> 36:00.064
Festive.

36:00.367 --> 36:03.155
Thanks for the compliment
but who the hell are you again?

36:03.328 --> 36:04.364
He's the guy you just helped save.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.036
Yeah, the meta who can read your mind.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.619
Oh, good. Then he knows that I'm
thinking that there is only room

36:08.708 --> 36:11.041
for one new guy in this group
and that's me.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.703
I'm not here to fight crime
or get a code name.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.668
Just to brainstorm ideas
about my powers.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.758
I hereby christen thee "Brainstorm."

36:20.178 --> 36:21.168
Come on, man.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.174
I've been here for months
and I don't have a name yet.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.298
Uh-oh.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.683
- What? What is it?
- Security at the loft.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.888
It's probably just more gifts
being delivered.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.264
I'll be right back.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.108
Hello.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.488
Hello, Mr. Allen.

36:46.496 --> 36:47.486
Dominic?

36:48.081 --> 36:51.370
You really have an acute
sense of detection and wit.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.659
<i>But like I said, Mr. Allen,</i>

36:53.878 --> 36:56.712
you are incapable of seeing
the breadth of my machinations.

37:00.385 --> 37:01.375
DeVoe?

37:01.511 --> 37:03.252
You really should have listened
to your teacher.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.300
How is this possible?

37:22.240 --> 37:26.780
I told you
I have a very important buyer, Dom.

37:40.341 --> 37:41.422
As promised.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.753
Always a pleasure doing business
with another savvy woman.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.140
Please, don't do this to me.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.684
I won't be doing anything to you.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.982
Pleased to meet you, Dominic Lanse.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.489
Or should I say, Subject Six?

38:11.539 --> 38:14.748
I have created many meta-humans

38:15.502 --> 38:19.997
but only your unique abilities
will allow me to do...

38:24.969 --> 38:25.959
This.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.673
You see, Mr. Allen, three months ago

39:08.763 --> 39:10.629
you emerged from the Speed Force
a new man.

39:10.932 --> 39:14.096
And in order for you
and the world to experience my plan,

39:14.185 --> 39:16.051
I, too, needed to be reborn.

39:16.896 --> 39:18.307
If you hurt my family...

39:22.193 --> 39:24.310
I have no interest in your family.

39:24.904 --> 39:27.772
Besides, you're gonna need someone
to miss you when you're gone.

39:28.241 --> 39:29.231
What did you do?

39:29.325 --> 39:31.863
I merely left something for you.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.365
It's a regift, as it were.

39:35.456 --> 39:38.540
<i>I don't have need for it anymore.</i>

40:02.191 --> 40:04.604
<i>Allen! C.C.P.D. Open up.</i>

40:05.278 --> 40:06.268
<i>Open up in there.</i>

40:08.531 --> 40:09.817
<i>Breach, breach, breach!</i>

40:28.092 --> 40:29.128
Don't run.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.085
Move, move, move.

40:32.138 --> 40:33.424
Keep your hands
where I can see them, Barry.

40:38.353 --> 40:39.389
<i>Clear!</i>

40:40.104 --> 40:41.220
<i>Clear!</i>

40:48.404 --> 40:51.613
Barry Allen, you're under arrest
for the murder of Clifford DeVoe.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.947
Excuse me, I have to go.

41:00.083 --> 41:01.745
But thank you so much.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.041
Of course, thank you for coming.

41:03.670 --> 41:04.660
Merry Christmas to you all.

41:04.754 --> 41:05.961
Merry Christmas.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.344
I told you I would stand beside you.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.488
Always.

41:39.205 --> 41:40.696
Now, let's bring about
the Enlightenment.
