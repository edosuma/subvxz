02:19.400 --> 02:20.526
Coming in!

02:29.110 --> 02:31.943
- Come on. Double time!
- Let's go! Come on!

03:05.613 --> 03:08.480
- Don't blow it.
- Steady!

03:08.549 --> 03:11.677
All right, guys.
Move out! Let's go!

03:11.752 --> 03:14.721
- Where's Stark and Westlake?
- Didn't make it.

03:14.789 --> 03:16.654
- Rudy too?
- All three.

03:16.724 --> 03:18.749
Oh, man! What happened?

03:18.826 --> 03:21.260
Cuban soldiers caught us
in a cross fire on the beach...

03:21.329 --> 03:23.627
an hour after you guys took off.

03:23.698 --> 03:27.156
Shit, man, that's bad.
We're fucked now.

03:27.235 --> 03:29.533
Fidel Castro today accused
the United States...

03:29.604 --> 03:32.038
of being behind yesterday's
predawn raid...

03:32.106 --> 03:34.939
on what appears to have been
a drug processing plant...

03:35.009 --> 03:37.204
some 30 miles south of Havana.

03:37.278 --> 03:39.508
- A force of 20 men landed...
- Twenty?

03:39.580 --> 03:42.105
What an insult.
It should have felt like 50.

03:42.183 --> 03:44.879
Three of the men were killed
by Cuban military forces.

03:44.952 --> 03:48.513
They've been tentatively identified
as James Stark, Kevin Westlake...

03:48.589 --> 03:51.183
and Rudy Garcia, all from the U.S.

03:51.259 --> 03:53.284
Talk about how many we killed.

03:53.361 --> 03:55.295
Goddamned bureaucratic bitch.

03:55.363 --> 03:58.560
U.S. Officials deny involvement...

03:58.633 --> 04:01.966
in this independent venture...

04:02.036 --> 04:06.973
utilizing mercenaries and financed
by anti-Castro forces.

04:07.041 --> 04:10.738
Officials went on to say
there was no way such a raid...

04:10.811 --> 04:12.711
- could have been launched...
- In other words...

04:12.780 --> 04:14.975
we no longer officially exist.

04:15.049 --> 04:17.244
In other words,
we're out of a fucking job.

04:17.317 --> 04:20.116
Shit, man. I've got
a mortgage to pay.

04:20.187 --> 04:23.247
Congress will launch a full
investigation into the raid.

04:23.324 --> 04:25.417
Deny American involvement?

04:25.493 --> 04:27.290
Deny that, motherfucker.

04:27.361 --> 04:28.988
You couldn't just
change the channel?

04:29.063 --> 04:31.531
- Kick his ass!
- I fucking changed the channel.

04:31.599 --> 04:34.227
Me and fucking Elvis.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.404
So what do we do now?

04:38.472 --> 04:39.598
Nothing.

04:41.943 --> 04:43.410
We just wait.

04:43.477 --> 04:46.446
Something will come along.

05:06.634 --> 05:08.568
Who is that?

05:08.636 --> 05:11.867
Get that fool!
Get him, boy!

05:13.674 --> 05:14.800
I'll teach you!

05:16.243 --> 05:17.710
Now I'll show you.

05:22.249 --> 05:24.149
You ain't done yet.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.029
- Jerome, are you okay?
- Get off of me.

05:37.098 --> 05:39.464
I don't need your help, dude.

05:40.534 --> 05:42.331
Why don't you try me?

05:42.403 --> 05:45.338
Mr. Tay, I want you out of here.
Both of you, out!

05:45.406 --> 05:47.806
- Fuck you!
- Get out!

05:47.875 --> 05:49.672
Go to class!

05:51.379 --> 05:53.643
- Go to class.
- Please go to class.

05:53.714 --> 05:56.444
Go on. Get out of here.

05:58.019 --> 06:01.182
What is it with you?
You're determined to be O.T.'d?

06:01.255 --> 06:03.985
I'm standing here.
You're always hassling me.

06:04.058 --> 06:05.753
I'm not hassling you, Mr. Lacas.

06:05.826 --> 06:09.057
I'm speaking to you because you're
intelligent, you're a leader.

06:09.130 --> 06:12.725
I need you to look at me
for two minutes, Juan.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.233
I've heard the speeches, Jane.

06:14.301 --> 06:17.566
I don't make speeches. I'm speaking
to you with respect as a person.

06:17.638 --> 06:20.436
You're no person to me, bitch,
so back the fuck off.

06:20.508 --> 06:24.740
- 'Cause if you don't...
- If I don't, what?

06:24.812 --> 06:26.370
You'll fucking wish you did.

06:30.418 --> 06:31.816
What were his exact words?

06:31.851 --> 06:33.215
What were his exact words?

06:34.622 --> 06:37.113
That if I didn't back off,
I'd wish I did.

06:37.191 --> 06:39.250
- No, "fucking" wish you did.
- Yes.

06:39.326 --> 06:40.418
That's terrible.

06:40.494 --> 06:44.726
But technically speaking,
it wasn't a direct threat.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.960
You mean he didn't say he was going to
stab me with a knife at 4:15 p. m.

06:49.036 --> 06:52.369
- No, he didn't say that.
- But his attitude was threatening.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.034
- I can't O.T. Him for attitude.
- Look, Claude.

06:55.109 --> 06:58.567
You know me.
I don't quit on my kids.

06:58.646 --> 07:01.114
But this guy is dangerous.
The kids are scared of him.

07:01.182 --> 07:03.275
Believe it or not,
some are here to learn.

07:03.350 --> 07:05.682
I agree,
but I can't boot him out...

07:05.753 --> 07:08.813
without definite proof
of wrongdoing.

07:08.889 --> 07:10.823
I don't want a lawsuit.

07:11.959 --> 07:15.952
Fine. You want proof?
I'll get you proof.

07:22.403 --> 07:24.337
Here she comes.

07:33.814 --> 07:36.783
Cute, sweetheart.
All for nothing, mama.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.817
Have a beer with us.

07:41.889 --> 07:43.516
I want to see that beautiful ass.

07:57.638 --> 07:59.196
Fucking bitch.

08:02.276 --> 08:03.334
Fuck you up, bitch!

08:03.410 --> 08:05.674
I'm gonna lick your pussy like this.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.612
Get the fuck out of the car!

08:14.922 --> 08:17.789
See you later!

08:17.858 --> 08:20.156
I'll drop by the house.

09:27.928 --> 09:29.691
You bastard.

09:30.965 --> 09:32.933
I've never been so happy
to see anybody in my life.

09:34.535 --> 09:36.560
I missed you too.
What's going on?

09:36.637 --> 09:39.470
My students are trying
to kill me. How are you?

09:45.246 --> 09:47.908
Hey, come here.
Let me take care of it.

09:59.159 --> 10:01.719
Shale.

10:01.795 --> 10:04.593
Shale, you always had
the greatest hands.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.098
I missed you, cariÃ±a.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.501
What are you doing here anyway?

10:15.576 --> 10:17.976
Arert you supposed to be
off on some secret mission?

10:19.213 --> 10:21.408
No, they retired us.

10:21.482 --> 10:22.915
Really?

10:25.185 --> 10:26.447
You okay with that?

10:27.254 --> 10:28.687
No.

10:32.860 --> 10:35.454
What are you going to do?

10:36.864 --> 10:39.264
I guess I'll be a stockbroker.

10:42.636 --> 10:45.628
- Yeah, right.
- I could be a stockbroker.

11:16.537 --> 11:20.633
Shale? Joey. Got a gig.
Meet me at 10:00 at the strip joint.

11:20.708 --> 11:22.642
Hey, it's Uzi night.

11:59.346 --> 12:01.644
- Try your luck.
- Joey.

12:02.883 --> 12:04.578
Tell me about the gig.

12:04.651 --> 12:07.484
This guy's name is Wolfson.
He's a lawyer.

12:07.554 --> 12:09.647
I hate lawyers.

12:09.723 --> 12:11.520
He's money.

12:11.592 --> 12:14.356
This guy's got a client
who's looking for a trained crew.

12:14.428 --> 12:16.453
He wants to meet you tomorrow,
10:00.

12:16.530 --> 12:17.758
Trained crew for what?

12:18.999 --> 12:20.227
That's what the meeting's for.

12:25.172 --> 12:27.299
I don't know.
I don't like it.

12:27.374 --> 12:30.207
You don't even know
what it is yet.

12:30.277 --> 12:32.802
- Drugs?
- It's not drugs.

12:33.714 --> 12:36.774
Come on, I busted my ass
to set this up.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.648
Don't go in there
and fuck it up.

12:41.722 --> 12:43.570
When the world is giving
you trouble, think John Janus.

12:43.605 --> 12:45.418
When the world is giving
you trouble, think John Janus.

12:45.492 --> 12:49.258
"Soldier of Fortune" magazine
calls him the ultimate mercenary.

12:49.329 --> 12:52.059
- That's nice.
- From Tripoli to Panama he's proven it.

12:52.132 --> 12:55.465
Piano wire, knives,
artillery, land mines...

12:55.536 --> 12:57.766
- bayonets, helicopter repelling...
- Isn't that funny?

12:57.838 --> 12:59.829
Smoke jumping, parachuting,
karate...

12:59.907 --> 13:03.070
missiles, guns and his bare hands.

13:03.143 --> 13:05.805
They don't call him
a one-man army for nothing.

13:05.879 --> 13:09.474
So when you want clean, private
mercenary work at reasonable rates...

13:09.550 --> 13:12.178
think John Janus.

13:13.253 --> 13:15.517
- That was so hot.
- It really was.

13:15.589 --> 13:17.284
Great editing too.
Who was the editor?

13:17.357 --> 13:19.587
The guy that does rock videos.

13:20.394 --> 13:23.852
Thanks, John.
Stay and watch Mr. Shale's reel.

13:23.931 --> 13:25.091
I don't have a reel.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.627
I see.

13:28.702 --> 13:30.897
Why don't I show John out?

13:30.971 --> 13:33.701
- John.
- Thank you, Matt.

13:33.774 --> 13:36.470
Get yourself a video, old-timer.

13:38.412 --> 13:41.313
Thanks for coming.
Really very impressive.

13:41.381 --> 13:44.350
- We'll be in touch soon.
- Thank you very much.

13:44.418 --> 13:46.545
- See you, sweet thing.
- Talk to you soon.

13:53.627 --> 13:55.891
God, that's better.

13:55.963 --> 13:58.158
I've been holding that for 20 minutes
waiting for her to leave.

13:58.232 --> 14:02.464
- Thank you for sharing.
- Ten grams of fiber every morning.

14:02.536 --> 14:04.504
Flushes all the toxins
right out of your system.

14:04.571 --> 14:07.404
It's great.
Regularity is the key.

14:09.743 --> 14:13.110
- You want some?
- No, I flushed this morning.

14:13.180 --> 14:15.307
Orange juice, decaf, tea?

14:15.382 --> 14:17.407
No, thank you.
Can we talk about the job?

14:19.386 --> 14:22.116
You're a real cut-to-the-chase
kind of guy.

14:22.189 --> 14:24.316
- That's me.
- Thank you, Dierdre.

14:24.391 --> 14:26.951
- Sure, Matt.
- Good. I like that.

14:27.027 --> 14:29.188
Uh, all right.

14:29.263 --> 14:33.529
My client runs an import business
dealing in South American goods.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.728
Obviously, his business depends on
a steady flow of products.

14:36.803 --> 14:37.895
Regularity is the key?

14:39.673 --> 14:41.607
Very good. Exactly.

14:41.675 --> 14:44.667
Delays can cost you
a large chunk of the market.

14:44.745 --> 14:46.906
We're looking
for trained soldiers...

14:46.980 --> 14:48.971
who can guarantee the shipments...

14:49.049 --> 14:52.610
and have the ability to deal decisively
with anyone who tries to interfere.

14:54.354 --> 14:55.412
Like who?

14:55.489 --> 14:59.152
Well, our competitors...

14:59.226 --> 15:04.095
certain government agencies,
which sometimes is the same thing.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.325
Uh-huh.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.564
So what you're looking for is a crew
to protect your drug shipments...

15:10.637 --> 15:12.605
possibly kill any rival dealers...

15:13.807 --> 15:17.038
and maybe even government agents
if they happen to get in the way?

15:17.110 --> 15:20.170
Didn't I say you were
a cut-to-the-chase kind of guy?

15:21.381 --> 15:24.043
You don't want soldiers.
You want killers.

15:24.117 --> 15:26.677
You'll have to
excuse me here, Shale...

15:26.753 --> 15:28.687
because I wasn't aware
there was a difference.

15:28.755 --> 15:32.521
There's a difference.
You want to know what it is?

15:32.593 --> 15:35.653
Yeah, I'll play.
Tell me what the difference is.

15:35.729 --> 15:37.492
But I don't want any...

15:40.233 --> 15:42.758
The difference is...

15:42.836 --> 15:45.566
you're still breathing.

15:52.713 --> 15:54.340
That cereal does work.

15:59.052 --> 16:02.453
- What's with you?
- I told you no drugs.

16:02.522 --> 16:05.423
Did the plate in your head
shift or something?

16:05.492 --> 16:07.517
That's all that's out there.

16:07.594 --> 16:10.620
- At least it's a job.
- A job, Joey?

16:14.701 --> 16:17.295
You ever look up
the word "mercenary"?

16:17.371 --> 16:19.305
It's someone who works
merely for money.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.209
Everybody works for money.

16:23.276 --> 16:26.177
It's not the money that bothers me.
It's the "merely. "

16:57.978 --> 17:00.742
- Hi, Miss Andrewson.
- Hi. Um, Janie?

17:00.814 --> 17:03.578
- She went jogging at the beach.
- Thanks.

17:34.014 --> 17:35.106
Watch out!

18:16.223 --> 18:19.158
I know it hurts, baby.
Try not to move. Don't move.

18:32.105 --> 18:33.231
How are you feeling?

18:34.241 --> 18:36.607
I feel good.

18:36.676 --> 18:38.644
That's the painkillers.

18:38.712 --> 18:41.078
I talked to the cops.

18:41.148 --> 18:44.413
They got an "all-points" out
on a six-foot-six Seminole.

18:44.484 --> 18:48.944
Yeah? You'll find a zillion
of them in the Everglades.

18:50.290 --> 18:53.088
- Where are my clothes?
- They hid them so you can't find them.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.957
- Yeah, right.
- Lie down.

18:55.028 --> 18:57.519
- I hate hospitals.
- It's just for a couple of days.

18:57.597 --> 19:00.088
Come on. Your leg's busted.
You can't walk.

19:00.167 --> 19:01.828
It is busted.

19:02.903 --> 19:04.666
Lacas set me up.

19:04.738 --> 19:07.298
- Is he the one who hassled you?
- It had to be him.

19:07.374 --> 19:11.105
- I'll take care of him.
- You'll drop a grenade on him.

19:11.178 --> 19:12.839
If he did it, he deserves it.

19:12.913 --> 19:15.211
No, I don't want you
to get into it.

19:17.584 --> 19:19.677
Janie, would you relax?

19:19.753 --> 19:22.051
I'm not going to do anything
you don't want me to do.

19:22.122 --> 19:25.683
- Okay.
- Just get in and stay here...

19:25.759 --> 19:27.693
until it's better.

19:29.529 --> 19:33.124
Then help me
if you want to help me.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.328
Call Michael Jones.

19:36.403 --> 19:38.837
He's in the book.

19:38.905 --> 19:40.839
Tell him he's got to
substitute for me.

19:40.907 --> 19:43.569
Then I want you to call Arlene.

19:44.544 --> 19:47.342
I don't know where she is.
Tell her I won't be in for a while.

19:47.414 --> 19:48.847
Okay?

19:54.020 --> 19:56.113
Admissions!

19:56.189 --> 19:59.158
She's in Admissions, I think.

20:00.427 --> 20:02.622
I'm booked this week.

20:02.696 --> 20:04.630
Can you get somebody
to fill in until next week?

20:04.698 --> 20:07.690
Yeah, okay. Thanks anyway.

20:07.767 --> 20:10.531
- I'll give you a call next week.
- Okay. Bye.

20:41.368 --> 20:44.166
So I need a teaching certificate...

20:44.237 --> 20:47.070
and put me on the computer...

20:47.140 --> 20:49.472
at the school registry
by tomorrow morning.

20:49.542 --> 20:51.169
Oh, Rem?

20:51.244 --> 20:55.305
Give me some good academic
credentials. I mean good ones.

20:55.382 --> 20:58.408
Yeah, whatever.

20:58.485 --> 20:59.918
Name?

21:00.987 --> 21:04.787
Something unusual.
Smith. James Smith.

22:29.209 --> 22:30.699
- Morning, Jerome.
- Hey, man.

22:31.745 --> 22:35.112
How are you doing, Rolanda?
Great.

22:35.181 --> 22:38.309
Manuelo, you need a haircut, son.

22:39.486 --> 22:42.455
Good morning.
Can I help you?

22:42.522 --> 22:45.582
Maybe. I'm looking
for Miss Hetzko's room.

22:45.658 --> 22:47.785
My name's Smith.
I'm her substitute.

22:47.861 --> 22:50.227
- Claude Rolle. I'm the principal.
- Good to meet you.

22:50.296 --> 22:52.491
You're not one of our
regular subs.

22:52.565 --> 22:55.625
She wanted Michael Jones,
but he was booked so he called me.

22:55.702 --> 22:58.227
Well, good. I'll point you
in the right direction.

22:58.304 --> 23:00.932
- Thank you.
- Janie's ill?

23:01.007 --> 23:03.635
- She got mugged.
- No.

23:03.710 --> 23:06.611
That's terrible.

23:06.679 --> 23:09.375
Hey, put that skateboard
in your locker.

23:09.449 --> 23:13.510
- Is she okay?
- Apparently, but I don't know her.

23:13.586 --> 23:17.920
Can't be too careful these days.
She's a fighter. She'll pull through.

23:17.991 --> 23:19.549
Jimenez, you're late.

23:19.626 --> 23:22.459
- Upstairs, first class you see.
- Thank you.

23:22.529 --> 23:25.498
Bring your paperwork to the office,
or you won't get paid.

23:25.565 --> 23:28.398
Hey. Good luck.

23:29.903 --> 23:32.269
Okay, let's move it.
Get to class. You're late.

23:59.332 --> 24:01.732
Miss Hetzko's class?
Let's go.

24:01.801 --> 24:04.770
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the substitute. Come on.

24:06.840 --> 24:09.809
Okay, Romeo, that's enough.
Break it up.

24:37.570 --> 24:39.094
Good morning, class.

24:41.441 --> 24:44.933
My name is Mr. Smith.

24:47.113 --> 24:50.241
I will be Miss Hetzko's substitute
for the next few days.

24:50.316 --> 24:53.012
Is Miss Hetzko taking a break?

24:53.086 --> 24:55.020
Is that what happened?

25:02.395 --> 25:04.363
Mother, we ain't in church.

25:04.430 --> 25:05.863
Okay.

25:15.975 --> 25:17.254
Henry Alvin.

25:17.289 --> 25:18.534
Henry Alvin.

25:18.611 --> 25:20.545
Over here.

25:21.681 --> 25:23.740
If you can't talk, Henry,
just raise your hand.

25:27.587 --> 25:31.648
If so many of you can't talk,
it's going to be more quiet in here.

25:36.229 --> 25:38.163
Henry Alvin.

25:39.599 --> 25:40.827
Lisa Rodriguez.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.235
Bitch.

25:46.105 --> 25:48.699
- Michael Davis.
- You all seen Michael?

25:48.775 --> 25:51.710
That's right. He's in the hall
rubbing your mom's booty, man.

25:55.648 --> 25:57.741
- Frank Davis.
- Yo.

25:57.817 --> 26:00.684
I'm Frank.
He's just messing with you.

26:00.753 --> 26:03.415
- You two brothers?
- No. He wishes he was.

26:03.489 --> 26:06.481
Get off that damn
government cheese.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.794
Juan Lacas.

26:28.548 --> 26:30.914
That was sharp, dude.

26:30.984 --> 26:33.714
Sure was sharp.

26:33.786 --> 26:36.254
What era of history
are you studying now?

26:36.322 --> 26:37.482
The fuck-you era.

26:40.059 --> 26:42.220
And what have you covered so far?

26:42.295 --> 26:45.264
The button of that
ferret ass you got.

26:46.799 --> 26:49.666
- Who won World War II?
- Your mama, man.

26:52.138 --> 26:55.972
And... here comes a tough one...
who discovered America?

26:56.042 --> 26:57.134
Fat mama.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.562
- What's your name?
- I'm Jerome, dog.

27:01.597 --> 27:02.844
- What's your name?
- I'm Jerome, dog.

27:02.915 --> 27:05.213
A 16-inch woofer from Opa-Locka.

27:05.285 --> 27:07.446
Straight from the bottom.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.920
- Go up there, kid.
- Yeah.

27:09.989 --> 27:11.752
Opa-Locka, never drop-a

27:11.824 --> 27:15.157
Tie them on my peoples
Keep it real 'cause it's lethal

27:15.228 --> 27:17.856
Ain't nothing sweet, dude
Miami has us down

27:17.930 --> 27:20.057
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:24.437 --> 27:27.873
That bouncer's dead, yeah.

27:32.845 --> 27:36.372
That's real special, Jerome.

27:42.188 --> 27:44.656
Are you responsible
for this coffee, Hannah?

27:44.724 --> 27:46.817
Don't start with me, Darryl.

27:47.994 --> 27:51.395
I know it's yours... it stays black
after you pour cream in it.

27:56.402 --> 27:59.371
- You're subbing for Jane Hetzko?
- Right.

27:59.439 --> 28:01.464
Darryl Sherman, English and Drama.

28:01.541 --> 28:03.839
- Jim Smith. Good to meet you.
- You too.

28:05.478 --> 28:07.412
Is it true they broke
her kneecap?

28:08.815 --> 28:11.079
- That's what I heard.
- Sons of bitches.

28:11.150 --> 28:12.845
I get my hands on them,
I'll show them a thing or two.

28:12.919 --> 28:16.912
Life is too short
to mess with the K.O.D.

28:16.989 --> 28:20.186
I'm Hannah Dillon,
School Librarian.

28:20.259 --> 28:24.218
- Jim Smith. Good to meet you.
- Stay away from the coffee.

28:24.297 --> 28:25.389
You drink it.

28:25.465 --> 28:27.399
I'm immune.

28:29.469 --> 28:31.801
Excuse me.
What is the K.O.D.?

28:31.871 --> 28:34.931
The "Kings of Destruction,"
the top gang in the school.

28:35.007 --> 28:37.999
"Posse," please. You're so unip.

28:39.579 --> 28:42.548
Could they have been responsible
for what happened to Miss Hetzko?

28:42.615 --> 28:45.448
- It's possible.
- Possible?

28:45.518 --> 28:49.284
Nothing happens around here
that isn't inspired by the K.O.D.

28:49.355 --> 28:51.289
Or "KOD," as I think of them.

28:52.992 --> 28:55.051
Why would they have been after her?

28:55.128 --> 28:58.689
Lacas threatened her.
She wanted him transferred.

28:58.765 --> 29:02.792
- Juan Lacas?
- Yeah, he's the leader of the K.O.D.

29:02.869 --> 29:05.099
He's a pain in the ass,
is what he is.

29:05.171 --> 29:07.639
Why wasn't he just transferred?

29:07.707 --> 29:11.040
Ask Rolle.
It was his decision.

29:11.110 --> 29:14.102
Criticize Rolle all you want.
He was a cop and knows the law.

29:14.180 --> 29:16.444
No evidence, no case. Period.

29:16.516 --> 29:19.610
That's right, Darryl.
You keep the faith.

29:26.426 --> 29:28.485
If Hannah had her way,
we'd go back to the days...

29:28.561 --> 29:31.462
when you could bludgeon a kid
for looking at you cross-eyed.

29:31.531 --> 29:33.863
I know. I went to school here.

29:35.701 --> 29:37.225
Rolle was a cop?

29:37.303 --> 29:41.296
Yeah, the gang unit.
He's an amazing man.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.012
Excuse me, Mr. Rolle?

29:47.079 --> 29:50.640
I'm looking for Juan Lacas's file.
The secretary said you had it.

29:50.716 --> 29:52.911
The file is under review
at the moment, Mr...

29:53.753 --> 29:55.687
- Smith.
- Smith. Right.

29:55.755 --> 29:57.347
If it was Petarusky, I'd remember.

29:58.591 --> 29:59.922
Come on.

30:02.328 --> 30:04.262
Have a seat.

30:05.998 --> 30:08.558
Speaking of unusual commitment...

30:08.634 --> 30:12.866
how is it that a cop
becomes a high school principal?

30:12.939 --> 30:14.873
You want the short version?

30:14.941 --> 30:17.842
I was at the Liberty City riots
in 1980...

30:17.910 --> 30:20.310
not the best time to be
a black cop in Miami.

30:21.380 --> 30:23.780
You watch your own neighborhood
burn down...

30:23.850 --> 30:26.318
people you grew up with
getting shot and busted.

30:27.253 --> 30:29.380
You suddenly face a clear choice.

30:29.455 --> 30:32.788
Devastation or education.

30:32.859 --> 30:34.622
I chose the latter.

30:34.694 --> 30:36.924
I went to night school,
got my certificate...

30:36.996 --> 30:39.988
got my masters,
and now here I am.

30:40.066 --> 30:42.296
And running for city council,
I hear.

30:43.202 --> 30:44.863
If the voters are wise.

30:44.937 --> 30:47.804
What's your background, Mr. Smith?

30:47.874 --> 30:51.833
Standard liberal arts education.
I was a government bureaucratic worker.

30:51.911 --> 30:54.038
Mostly in Health, Education
and Welfare department.

30:55.681 --> 30:59.583
Then, uh, I guess, like you,
I wanted to teach.

31:00.753 --> 31:03.381
You won those scars
in the halls of academe?

31:04.290 --> 31:06.690
No. Nuns, eighth grade.

31:09.128 --> 31:12.325
Well, you better get back to work.

31:12.398 --> 31:16.266
I really can't issue those files
to a temporary employee.

31:16.335 --> 31:18.496
- Sorry.
- No problem at all.

31:18.571 --> 31:21.404
Thanks for your time.

31:21.474 --> 31:23.942
Oh, I've got to ask.

31:24.010 --> 31:26.706
Doesn't it make you nervous
wearing a watch like that around here?

31:26.779 --> 31:29.213
This watch was a gift
from the Junior League.

31:29.282 --> 31:31.682
Anyone trying to take this watch
will have to take this arm.

31:31.751 --> 31:35.744
It's been known to happen.
They hack them off with chain saws now.

31:36.722 --> 31:39.384
Students in Wood Shop
made these for me.

31:39.458 --> 31:43.724
Every year at first assembly,
I give a little demonstration.

31:50.136 --> 31:51.933
Power perceived...

31:53.005 --> 31:54.939
is power achieved.

31:57.677 --> 32:00.874
I'd remember that little truism,
Mr. Smith.

32:00.947 --> 32:03.472
It will assist you greatly
in your teaching.

32:26.739 --> 32:29.469
- Nice tie.
- We don't need any insurance.

32:29.542 --> 32:31.476
We might.
You haven't heard the gig yet.

32:31.544 --> 32:32.772
Tell us what it is.

32:33.946 --> 32:36.437
- It's something different.
- Who gives a shit?

32:36.515 --> 32:39.973
I just want to get back
in the action.

32:40.052 --> 32:43.112
- It's a school.
- Damn! It is a school.

32:43.189 --> 32:45.487
- I told you, man.
- What kind of school?

32:45.558 --> 32:47.992
A high school.
I'm substituting there.

32:48.060 --> 32:50.893
- Substitute for what?
- For Janie.

32:50.963 --> 32:53.523
She got kneecapped by a gang.
She's in the hospital now.

32:53.599 --> 32:55.897
Oh, shit.

32:55.968 --> 33:00.302
We all feel bad for Janie, right?
But a high school?

33:01.440 --> 33:04.170
What's in it for us?

33:04.243 --> 33:06.507
Well, probably nothing up front...

33:06.579 --> 33:08.638
but there might be something
on the back end.

33:10.650 --> 33:13.619
Maybe something on the back end.

33:13.686 --> 33:16.519
You mind telling me what the fuck
is wrong with this picture?

33:16.589 --> 33:18.853
First you turn down Wolfson.

33:18.924 --> 33:21.859
Now you want us to go do a job
at a high school on deferment.

33:21.927 --> 33:25.192
- Hollan, chill out.
- Chill out yourself!

33:25.264 --> 33:28.131
High school is bullshit, man.

33:28.200 --> 33:31.169
You all know what's wrong.
You ain't got the guts to say it.

33:31.237 --> 33:33.831
- Why don't you tell us, Hollan?
- I'll tell it, man.

33:33.906 --> 33:37.808
Cuba wimped you out.
You lost your mind and your balls.

33:37.877 --> 33:39.344
Maybe I'll borrow yours.

33:40.613 --> 33:43.047
On second thought,
maybe they're too small.

33:43.115 --> 33:45.049
Fuck you, man!

33:45.117 --> 33:46.846
Fucking queers.

33:54.660 --> 33:57.322
No promises, but I'm telling you,
there's something wrong there.

33:57.396 --> 33:59.330
They're not doing their homework?

34:02.268 --> 34:04.202
All I can tell you...

34:04.270 --> 34:07.103
is these kids are walking around
with cellular phones and pagers...

34:07.173 --> 34:09.107
and driving $50,000 BMWs.

34:09.175 --> 34:11.109
There's drugs, and where
there's drugs there's cash.

34:11.177 --> 34:14.543
We're not going to walk
out of there empty-handed.

34:14.612 --> 34:17.206
It's your decision.
You tell me.

35:22.848 --> 35:25.214
Violation, violation.

35:32.358 --> 35:34.155
Good morning, class.

35:39.999 --> 35:42.331
Today...

35:42.401 --> 35:44.392
we're going to talk
about Vietnam.

35:44.470 --> 35:45.801
Viet who?

35:45.871 --> 35:47.498
Fuck that shit.

35:59.185 --> 36:01.983
You had to be resourceful
in Vietnam.

36:02.054 --> 36:03.988
You had to grow eyes
in the back of your head.

36:05.057 --> 36:06.649
You're a dead motherfucker!

36:06.725 --> 36:10.627
I don't like disorder in my room.
Clean it up, Tay.

36:13.365 --> 36:15.856
Knock that nigger out,
my nigger.

36:15.935 --> 36:17.027
Fuck you!

36:19.572 --> 36:22.302
You're gonna fuck that nigger up?
He represent K.O.D.

36:22.374 --> 36:24.365
Stay down there
until it looks spotless.

36:26.111 --> 36:28.409
Ah, man, look at him, dog.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.414
All red and embarrassed.

36:30.482 --> 36:32.677
Shut up, Jerome.

36:32.751 --> 36:34.912
And you, hand over the ice pick.

36:34.987 --> 36:36.682
I ain't got no ice pick.

36:36.755 --> 36:39.417
This is my class, Rodriguez.

36:39.491 --> 36:41.356
I don't allow weapons in here.

36:41.427 --> 36:43.725
This ain't your class, bitch.
I'll carry what I want.

36:43.796 --> 36:45.388
Take that Superman shit
somewhere else.

36:46.665 --> 36:48.690
It's impolite to stick your finger
in somebody's chest.

36:48.767 --> 36:51.133
Would you like it
if I did that to you?

36:51.203 --> 36:53.171
Hand over the ice pick, please.

36:56.308 --> 36:57.502
Thank you.

36:58.444 --> 36:59.604
Sit down.

36:59.678 --> 37:01.168
You broke my hand.

37:01.247 --> 37:04.273
I bent it. I don't break them
on the first offense.

37:08.153 --> 37:12.852
I'm in charge of this class.
I'm the warrior chief.

37:13.926 --> 37:18.022
I'm the merciless god of anything
that stirs in my universe.

37:19.999 --> 37:24.095
You fuck with me
and you will suffer my wrath.

37:30.142 --> 37:31.302
Yeah.

37:31.377 --> 37:33.675
Can I go to the nurse's office?

37:34.847 --> 37:35.939
Sure, Rodriguez.

37:36.015 --> 37:38.006
Go ahead.
Take Tay with you.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.916
- Come on, bitch.
- Man, take this with you.

37:49.795 --> 37:51.729
Anybody else want to go?

37:53.365 --> 37:55.925
Okay, let's get back
to Vietnam.

38:00.272 --> 38:02.240
Anybody know where it is?

38:03.442 --> 38:04.636
It's in Korea?

38:08.881 --> 38:10.974
We facilitated a day care program...

38:11.050 --> 38:14.019
so young mothers can come back
to school and still see their children.

38:14.086 --> 38:16.054
Fuck! Ah, no!

38:16.121 --> 38:18.715
Excuse me.

38:18.791 --> 38:22.022
Get me some ice or something.
This is killing me.

38:22.094 --> 38:24.289
- What's going on here?
- Ask Mr. Smith.

38:24.363 --> 38:27.491
- I'm suing this fucking place.
- Stop that language.

38:28.801 --> 38:31.634
Marvin, we've got trouble
in room 3B.

38:33.439 --> 38:35.703
Hey, get to class.

38:39.411 --> 38:42.437
I was a member of a special ops
team called "Mercs. "

38:42.514 --> 38:45.813
Long-range reconnaissance teams
that were choppered to the jungle...

38:45.884 --> 38:48.318
in areas along
the Ho Chi Min Trail.

38:49.388 --> 38:52.687
Fighting with these
native mountain tribes.

38:53.592 --> 38:55.719
When we'd run out of bullets...

38:55.794 --> 38:58.592
we'd have to take the weapons...
their AK-47s...

38:58.664 --> 39:00.825
off the enemy dead
and use their ammo.

39:00.899 --> 39:03.595
That way we could keep fighting,
keep advancing.

39:03.669 --> 39:06.502
That sounds like a Saturday night
in Miami, you know?

39:07.940 --> 39:10.534
My uncle got his legs
blown off in Vietnam...

39:10.609 --> 39:12.941
but he doesn't talk about it.

39:13.012 --> 39:15.446
- We were there because of Hitler?
- Fuck no, dog.

39:15.514 --> 39:17.573
That's World War I
you're talking about.

39:17.649 --> 39:19.173
No, those were earlier wars.

39:19.251 --> 39:21.344
We were in Vietnam
to fight Communism.

39:21.420 --> 39:25.151
That's why my family left Cuba...
because Castro turned Communist.

39:25.224 --> 39:27.192
- Uh-huh.
- What's up, Mr. Smith?

39:27.259 --> 39:29.193
How many people did you kill
in Vietnam?

39:32.097 --> 39:33.496
I never counted.

39:33.565 --> 39:36.966
Mr. Smith,
you lost any homeboys?

39:38.470 --> 39:40.028
I lost some homeboys.

39:40.105 --> 39:43.871
Me too, dog.
Mostly drive-bys, though.

39:43.942 --> 39:48.106
You ever been shot,
Mr. Whatever Your Name Is?

39:48.180 --> 39:49.704
Sucker.

39:52.918 --> 39:54.442
Yeah, I've been shot.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.250
Check this out.
I've been sliced and shot.

39:57.322 --> 40:00.382
Fuck that shit.
I got shot, you know.

40:00.459 --> 40:03.951
I got an AK in the leg.
That's what I'm talking about.

40:07.766 --> 40:09.734
See you.

40:53.078 --> 40:56.241
Two of your students are in the
nurse's office talking a lawsuit.

40:56.315 --> 40:58.112
Why, is the nurse a lawyer?

40:59.918 --> 41:03.684
Corporal punishment is not allowed
in the Dade County school system.

41:03.755 --> 41:05.950
It wasn't corporal punishment.
It was self-defense.

41:06.024 --> 41:09.619
And power achieved
is power perceived.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.165
Well, I will admit
you got their attention.

41:15.234 --> 41:18.829
Which is good,
but I can't afford a lawsuit.

41:18.904 --> 41:21.702
Now, if you were to apologize
to these two young men...

41:21.773 --> 41:24.105
Oh, that'll be the fucking day.

41:25.444 --> 41:28.607
Then you leave me no choice.
I have to let you go.

41:29.381 --> 41:31.349
No, wait a minute.

41:31.416 --> 41:34.010
You can't fire me
without two weeks' notice...

41:34.086 --> 41:36.520
not unless you want a public hearing
in front of the school board.

41:36.588 --> 41:39.489
Hey, you do what you have to do.

41:45.330 --> 41:48.458
On the other hand,
I want to be fair.

41:48.534 --> 41:50.331
You take your two weeks.

41:51.403 --> 41:53.030
Thanks. That's all I wanted.

42:02.014 --> 42:03.948
- James Smith.
- Here we are.

42:04.016 --> 42:07.816
- He's in the computer?
- Yes.

42:07.886 --> 42:10.821
- What's his background?
- Smith, James.

42:10.889 --> 42:13.619
He's a Harvard grad
with a masters from Yale.

42:14.860 --> 42:17.260
Wait, make that
two masters from Yale.

42:17.329 --> 42:21.163
This guy is amazing.
And wow... a Ph. D. From Princeton.

42:23.035 --> 42:24.969
You laid it on a little thick.

42:25.037 --> 42:27.972
What do you want
on such short notice?

42:28.040 --> 42:32.033
I'm starting to think he's taking
this teaching shit seriously.

42:59.204 --> 43:01.138
You don't have to help me.
I'm not a baby.

43:14.820 --> 43:17.152
I'll get it. Easy.

43:19.524 --> 43:21.583
I'm home!

43:21.660 --> 43:24.026
I don't have any groceries
or Percocet.

43:24.096 --> 43:26.121
My God, look at the mail.

43:26.198 --> 43:28.393
Leave that stuff alone
and get something to eat.

43:28.467 --> 43:30.833
Why didn't you bring it to me?
I could have done something.

43:30.902 --> 43:33.268
I was just sitting there,
doing nothing.

43:37.576 --> 43:39.407
Miss Hetzko, this is Jim Smith.

43:39.478 --> 43:41.912
I want to tell you that everything
is under control at school.

43:41.980 --> 43:45.211
Get better and don't worry.
Talk to you later.

43:45.284 --> 43:47.946
Under control?
Is he teaching them at gunpoint?

43:48.854 --> 43:51.516
This is the "Miami Herald,"
and I just...

44:14.179 --> 44:16.113
What is it?

44:22.454 --> 44:26.254
"Miss H, you were the only
teacher who cared about me.

44:29.027 --> 44:31.518
Please get well
and don't give up on us.

44:31.596 --> 44:33.894
Love, Lisa Rodriguez. "

44:38.904 --> 44:41.202
- That was very nice.
- Yeah.

44:41.273 --> 44:44.106
Don't cry. Sit down
and have a shrimp roll.

44:44.176 --> 44:46.110
I'm not crying.

44:47.679 --> 44:49.704
Smith probably made her
send it anyway.

44:49.781 --> 44:51.976
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- How do you know?

44:52.050 --> 44:54.211
I don't know, okay?

44:54.286 --> 44:58.416
But it figures a few kids
might send you a card on their own.

44:58.490 --> 45:01.755
It's obvious you have never
taught at Columbus High.

45:28.787 --> 45:31.722
Ladies, go to class.
Let's go.

45:37.629 --> 45:41.258
So the war in Vietnam
was about turf.

45:41.333 --> 45:44.131
The gangs in the north wanted
to take over the turf...

45:44.202 --> 45:46.136
of the gangs in the south.

45:46.204 --> 45:48.138
Look who made it.

45:52.077 --> 45:54.910
You're late, Juan.
That'll be one demerit.

45:56.681 --> 45:58.615
One demerit?

46:00.018 --> 46:03.249
Do I write "I'm sorry" ten times
on the blackboard?

46:05.424 --> 46:09.019
No, you're going to
write it 100 times.

46:12.998 --> 46:14.863
Let's go.

46:15.734 --> 46:19.864
Life is a chess game, Juan.
This is a crucial move.

46:21.072 --> 46:23.597
I want you to think it over.

46:39.357 --> 46:42.485
You're the one who should have
thought it through, motherfucker.

46:42.561 --> 46:46.190
Believe me, I have, Juan.
I have.

46:48.633 --> 46:50.692
Freddy Krueger, knock it off.

46:50.769 --> 46:52.361
This is not a manicure shop.

46:54.206 --> 46:56.697
- Get some real nails, girl.
- These are real, baby.

46:58.710 --> 47:00.644
- Fuck you all.
- Hey, really?

47:00.712 --> 47:03.180
Jerome, you know what your name
means in Apache?

47:03.248 --> 47:05.148
No. What does it mean?

47:05.217 --> 47:06.616
Geronimo.

47:09.654 --> 47:13.988
That word Apache in their language
means "the outcast," "the shunned ones. "

47:14.059 --> 47:18.257
Like their emblem, like players
today... outlaws, bandits.

47:18.330 --> 47:22.596
That translates easy enough into
the biker gangs of the '50s and '60s.

47:22.667 --> 47:25.761
- My times.
- The Beaver days.

47:25.837 --> 47:30.331
Yeah, I belonged to
a group called the Dragons.

47:30.408 --> 47:31.898
What were the black bikers?

47:31.977 --> 47:34.036
What were the brothers?

47:34.112 --> 47:35.670
They were called the Chaplains.

47:37.716 --> 47:40.344
- The Chaplains were black?
- What, they wore penny loafers?

47:42.287 --> 47:44.915
They were the biggest, baddest
black group of the '50s.

47:44.990 --> 47:47.288
Where I grew up, it was
the Dragons and the Enchanters.

47:47.359 --> 47:49.691
The Enchanters were the girls.

47:55.867 --> 47:57.459
How old were you?

47:57.536 --> 48:02.303
I was 12 years old
when I became a Junior Dragon.

48:02.374 --> 48:04.308
So Mr. Smith was a bad ass, huh?

48:05.610 --> 48:08.704
So, Mr. Smith, what were some
of the other black gangs?

48:08.780 --> 48:11.044
Gangs died out a little bit
in the late '60s...

48:11.116 --> 48:14.210
but it came back in the '70s.

48:14.286 --> 48:17.380
There was a gang
called the Black Spades.

48:18.490 --> 48:20.981
So these Black Spades
were like homeboys?

48:21.059 --> 48:24.460
All homeboys, 5,000 strong
all over the city of Miami.

48:24.529 --> 48:27.623
Dang! Fucked up.

48:29.401 --> 48:32.734
If there were 5,000, why are we
sitting in this classroom?

48:34.706 --> 48:38.267
Okay. What's the future
of staying in a gang?

48:38.343 --> 48:39.674
Bitches.

48:40.679 --> 48:41.941
Money, whores and clothes.

48:44.382 --> 48:47.283
Yeah, yeah.

48:47.352 --> 48:49.081
Maybe a one-way ticket to the joint?

48:49.154 --> 48:52.248
Got ya. I wanna get high.

48:52.324 --> 48:55.885
- Straight up, smoking.
- I didn't mean that, Rodriguez.

48:55.961 --> 48:57.588
I'm talking about the joint.

48:57.662 --> 49:00.756
You know, Raeford Prison upstate?

49:02.634 --> 49:05.865
That can't happen, Mr. Smith.
We're all juveniles.

49:05.937 --> 49:08.098
Until you're 18, then they
throw your ass in a cell...

49:08.173 --> 49:10.971
and you become a punk
or somebody's sweet boy.

49:11.042 --> 49:14.034
- You're gonna get fucked in jail.
- They've got to catch me first.

49:15.113 --> 49:17.911
What are we supposed to do,
work in some fast food joint...

49:17.983 --> 49:20.315
making minimum wage or something?

49:20.385 --> 49:22.148
Better than a gang funeral.

49:25.357 --> 49:26.847
How many of those you been to?

49:26.925 --> 49:29.120
Too many.

49:30.295 --> 49:32.229
Too fucking many.

49:33.632 --> 49:35.497
Is that what you want
for yourselves...

49:38.103 --> 49:40.537
what you want for your kids?

49:43.675 --> 49:45.404
How many of you have kids?

49:48.713 --> 49:50.044
You got a kid?

49:50.115 --> 49:51.810
How many of you want them
to be in gangs?

49:54.219 --> 49:56.881
Why not, if it's so great?

49:56.955 --> 49:59.753
But it's different
when you talk about your kids.

49:59.824 --> 50:01.883
Why?

50:01.960 --> 50:05.555
You don't want to see your kids
get in trouble, get hurt or busted.

50:05.630 --> 50:09.862
I don't want to see you kids
get hurt or get busted.

50:09.934 --> 50:11.731
What are we supposed to do?

50:15.840 --> 50:18.832
I'm not going to bullshit you.
I don't have all the answers.

50:20.945 --> 50:24.108
But I'd like to see
all of you survive.

51:00.018 --> 51:02.543
Mr. Smith.

51:02.620 --> 51:05.680
I want to commend you
on the way you handled Lacas.

51:05.757 --> 51:07.987
The best part is
you did it without violence.

51:08.059 --> 51:10.823
I like that. I tell you what.

51:10.895 --> 51:15.264
Come by my office after the faculty
meeting and we'll talk, okay?

51:15.333 --> 51:17.665
Okay.

51:23.074 --> 51:25.736
Put those out
and get to class.

51:36.988 --> 51:40.253
Today after the faculty meeting.

51:59.611 --> 52:02.102
- You're too slow!
- Bullshit, man.

52:23.434 --> 52:25.902
Wait 'til he's off school grounds.

52:25.970 --> 52:29.371
I don't want to kill him right off.
I want to cut him up first.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.374
To the left!

52:46.457 --> 52:47.651
Look at him.

52:47.725 --> 52:49.659
He's scared shitless.

52:49.727 --> 52:51.251
Shit.

53:01.139 --> 53:04.040
Marvin, we have a code ten
in the front hall.

53:29.934 --> 53:32.630
Hannah, get down behind
the desk now. Get down!

53:32.704 --> 53:35.195
You stay there 'til
I tell you to come out.

53:48.019 --> 53:50.180
All right, that's good enough.
Freeze right there.

53:50.255 --> 53:51.620
Put your weapons in the can't.

53:52.724 --> 53:53.816
Let's go!

53:59.831 --> 54:00.923
You, push it over.

54:02.800 --> 54:04.233
Easy.

54:08.840 --> 54:11.274
That's good.

54:11.342 --> 54:13.572
Hannah, come out here, sweetheart.

54:13.645 --> 54:15.272
Come on.

54:17.282 --> 54:20.217
Look, I want you to roll this
into your office.

54:20.285 --> 54:21.946
Are you listening to me?

54:22.020 --> 54:24.318
Roll this in your office,
lock the door...

54:24.389 --> 54:27.358
wait 15 minutes,
then call the police.

54:27.425 --> 54:29.916
You got that? Go on.

54:45.810 --> 54:48.938
Oh, I can't tell you boys
how much I've needed this.

54:50.782 --> 54:53.512
When we're done, I want you
to say "I'm sorry" 100 times.

54:53.584 --> 54:55.848
Shh. No talking in the library.

54:57.055 --> 54:59.216
It's time you boys
started hitting the books.

54:59.290 --> 55:02.657
Here's one... required reading.
"Catcher In The Rye. "

55:02.727 --> 55:05.719
- My mistake. Did I say "catcher"?
- Move in!

55:14.906 --> 55:17.704
Marvin.

55:38.062 --> 55:39.927
Checkmate, motherfucker.

56:01.520 --> 56:05.012
911? I'd like to report
an accident.

56:05.090 --> 56:06.523
Shit!

56:14.466 --> 56:17.492
Um, sorry. My mistake.

56:36.988 --> 56:39.548
He's toast.
Kill this bitch and split.

57:48.593 --> 57:50.527
I'm sorry about those windows.

57:50.595 --> 57:53.826
Hey, fuck it.

58:11.516 --> 58:13.006
You wanted to see me.

58:15.787 --> 58:18.119
It's a little late.

58:19.491 --> 58:22.051
Okay. There's always tomorrow.

58:28.967 --> 58:31.492
- Who is it?
- Hey, hey!

58:31.569 --> 58:33.662
Sherman? Oh, man!

58:33.738 --> 58:36.298
Open the door. Come on.

58:36.374 --> 58:38.433
Hurry up. Look... for you.

58:38.510 --> 58:40.444
For me? Wow!

58:40.512 --> 58:44.073
Oh, man, they're so beautiful.
I need them.

58:44.149 --> 58:46.640
Thank you. Hi.
Thank you so much.

58:46.718 --> 58:49.050
- Let me take those.
- Let me hold them... they're mine.

58:49.120 --> 58:51.418
You just sit on the couch.

58:51.489 --> 58:54.185
- You got that?
- I'm better. I'm so strong.

58:54.259 --> 58:56.352
- How's your knee?
- It's great.

58:56.428 --> 58:59.625
- I'm sorry I didn't come by sooner.
- That's okay.

59:02.901 --> 59:05.802
Hey, you look like a cripple.

59:05.870 --> 59:07.963
- What's that?
- What's what?

59:08.039 --> 59:10.837
These are the hairdos
that I wish I had.

59:10.909 --> 59:12.171
Is that me?

59:12.243 --> 59:13.801
Yeah, that's you.

59:13.878 --> 59:16.403
I want my hair to be like yours,
and they wouldn't do it.

59:16.481 --> 59:19.507
Let's talk about school.
Everybody thinking about me?

59:19.584 --> 59:21.108
Nope.

59:21.186 --> 59:24.178
That substitute you hired is amazing.
Where'd you find him?

59:24.255 --> 59:26.689
- Shale found him.
- Shale?

59:26.758 --> 59:29.249
Yeah, the guy I met
in Nicaragua.

59:30.328 --> 59:33.058
Yeah? Is that picture
in Nicaragua?

59:33.131 --> 59:34.393
Yeah.

59:34.466 --> 59:37.629
- What were you doing in Nicaragua?
- I was teaching.

59:37.702 --> 59:41.832
He was in the military. One of those
on-again, off-again relationships.

59:52.550 --> 59:55.451
- What are you telling me?
- You tell me what happened.

59:55.520 --> 59:58.216
I don't know,
but something's going on.

59:58.289 --> 01:00:00.814
- He can't be no fucking teacher.
- I'll worry about him.

01:00:00.892 --> 01:00:04.384
Just do what you're supposed to,
and don't call me here again.

01:00:23.715 --> 01:00:27.173
Wellman, it's Joey.
They're switching cars.

01:00:27.252 --> 01:00:31.712
I'm at the fruit stand on Griffin Road.
Get over here as soon as possible.

01:00:48.606 --> 01:00:50.733
- Where'd you get those?
- Darryl Sherman sent them.

01:00:53.178 --> 01:00:56.614
- Is he a teacher?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:56.681 --> 01:00:58.444
What have we got here?

01:00:58.516 --> 01:01:01.041
- I hope you're hungry.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:04.054
Arroz, plantains,
habichuelas negras.

01:01:04.122 --> 01:01:06.647
- This must be the flan.
- Where are you working?

01:01:06.724 --> 01:01:08.954
And palomilla.

01:01:09.027 --> 01:01:11.495
- Home security.
- Home security?

01:01:11.563 --> 01:01:13.758
Those are two words I never
would have associated with you.

01:01:13.832 --> 01:01:18.496
- Doing what?
- Planning people's security systems.

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:20.697
- I hope you're hungry.
- I am.

01:01:20.772 --> 01:01:22.467
I'd love to have some rice.

01:01:31.182 --> 01:01:33.480
Darryl told you?

01:01:35.453 --> 01:01:36.545
May I explain?

01:01:37.689 --> 01:01:39.782
Go ahead.

01:02:49.494 --> 01:02:51.519
See, it's not just the K.O.D.

01:02:53.765 --> 01:02:56.461
Rolle's in on this too.

01:03:00.905 --> 01:03:03.339
Does that mean my classroom
is going to turn into...

01:03:03.408 --> 01:03:05.808
your own private
little drug war?

01:03:05.877 --> 01:03:09.677
No, I just want them out
of there, same as you do.

01:03:09.747 --> 01:03:11.840
- Why should you care?
- I didn't at first.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.850
But you do now?

01:03:16.921 --> 01:03:21.915
The other day I was talking
and happened to glance back.

01:03:21.993 --> 01:03:25.053
- The weirdest thing happened.
- What?

01:03:27.398 --> 01:03:29.161
They were listening.

01:03:33.705 --> 01:03:37.436
I don't know.
I guess I felt like, you know...

01:03:37.508 --> 01:03:40.306
Like you were actually teaching.

01:03:41.479 --> 01:03:42.571
Yeah.

01:03:44.248 --> 01:03:47.684
Oh, I remember the feeling.

01:04:40.938 --> 01:04:43.236
Hello.

01:04:43.307 --> 01:04:45.138
Hi, Joey.

01:04:45.209 --> 01:04:47.677
Fine. Yes, he's here.

01:04:53.651 --> 01:04:55.050
Where are you?

01:04:56.421 --> 01:04:57.979
I'll be there in ten minutes.

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:02.991
- I've got to go.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:08.933 --> 01:05:10.730
- Janie.
- Yeah?

01:05:10.802 --> 01:05:13.202
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
It's up to you.

01:05:13.271 --> 01:05:16.798
I just want what I've always wanted...
that you be straight with me.

01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:20.903
That's hard when your whole life's
a covert operation.

01:05:30.054 --> 01:05:31.402
Where is this guy?

01:05:31.437 --> 01:05:32.750
Where is this guy?

01:05:32.824 --> 01:05:35.384
You can always count on him.

01:05:51.509 --> 01:05:52.601
What's going on?

01:05:52.677 --> 01:05:57.205
He pulled a car switch
at the fruit stand on Griffin Road.

01:05:57.281 --> 01:05:59.215
It's owned by an Indian
named Johnny Glades.

01:05:59.283 --> 01:06:02.081
- You heard of him?
- Yeah. The drug dealer?

01:06:02.153 --> 01:06:05.145
No, reputed.
He's never been convicted.

01:06:05.223 --> 01:06:08.681
The police surveil him all the time
and never turn up shit.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.990
That's the Indian
that hit Janie.

01:06:11.062 --> 01:06:13.326
Yeah, he's the muscle.

01:06:13.397 --> 01:06:16.264
The other asshole must be
the one who knows how to count.

01:06:18.302 --> 01:06:20.736
Lacas supplying Glades.

01:06:20.805 --> 01:06:23.603
If that ain't the tail
wagging the dog, huh?

01:06:26.811 --> 01:06:28.574
Got him.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.004
Here. Check it out.

01:07:14.392 --> 01:07:15.950
It's right.

01:07:22.066 --> 01:07:24.728
You take the boat.
The Indian's mine.

01:07:27.772 --> 01:07:30.605
I can't believe these guys.
They're two hours late.

01:07:30.675 --> 01:07:32.643
- It's the same old horseshit.
- Freeze.

01:07:34.512 --> 01:07:36.878
Hey there, big guy.

01:07:36.948 --> 01:07:39.473
Get on the ground, on your faces,
arms out at your side.

01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:42.041
- Fuck!
- Let's go.

01:07:42.119 --> 01:07:44.679
Goddamn it, Bull.

01:07:53.264 --> 01:07:54.663
Your friend's boat's sinking.

01:08:08.713 --> 01:08:10.346
You don't know who you're
fucking with, asshole.

01:08:10.381 --> 01:08:11.980
You don't know who you're
fucking with, asshole.

01:08:13.451 --> 01:08:17.011
Payback time.
Get up, linebacker boy.

01:08:17.822 --> 01:08:20.188
Yeah, you, dummy!
Go on, get up.

01:08:22.126 --> 01:08:25.060
It's your lucky day, man.
Come on. Kick his ass.

01:08:26.264 --> 01:08:29.596
That looks like it hurts.
Lay into him, boy!

01:08:30.667 --> 01:08:33.501
Kick yourself a field goal!

01:08:33.571 --> 01:08:35.595
I'll be damned.
He can kick too.

01:08:41.379 --> 01:08:44.542
Not fair, Shale!
No goddamned ninja horseshit.

01:08:58.863 --> 01:09:00.194
Took you long enough.

01:09:01.465 --> 01:09:04.127
- No thanks to you, asshole.
- Payback's a bitch.

01:09:05.036 --> 01:09:06.298
I guess we're even.

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:08.361
- You fucking psycho.
- Oh, yeah?

01:09:15.246 --> 01:09:17.942
Who's a fucking psycho?

01:09:23.688 --> 01:09:27.215
- I knew you'd come back.
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:09:31.095 --> 01:09:33.723
What do you want
to do with this?

01:09:36.867 --> 01:09:38.801
Hey! No, no!

01:09:43.474 --> 01:09:46.136
Dade County,
South fucking Florida.

01:09:57.755 --> 01:10:00.019
Early morning joggers
made a grisly discovery...

01:10:00.091 --> 01:10:03.356
the results of what police believe
was a drug deal gone bad.

01:10:03.427 --> 01:10:05.861
Detectives have been
combing the scene all morning.

01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:08.490
They're looking for clues
and trying to establish...

01:10:08.566 --> 01:10:10.500
if the victims were killed here...

01:10:10.568 --> 01:10:14.231
or killed at another location
and their bodies dumped here.

01:10:14.305 --> 01:10:16.603
Toxicology tests will be
performed on the bodies.

01:10:16.674 --> 01:10:19.074
- Results won't be known for weeks.
- Hello.

01:10:19.143 --> 01:10:22.510
- Claude!
- Yeah?

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.515
Half a million bucks!
What's going on, Claude?

01:10:25.583 --> 01:10:28.381
- I wish I knew.
- You know, they shot Bull.

01:10:28.452 --> 01:10:31.615
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I want you to hear something.

01:10:31.689 --> 01:10:34.487
- Hear what?
- Come on, he was my buddy!

01:10:35.326 --> 01:10:38.693
Hear what happens to who's responsible
if I don't get my money back.

01:10:50.441 --> 01:10:51.806
What was that all about?

01:10:53.344 --> 01:10:55.369
Nothing.

01:11:08.225 --> 01:11:09.658
Lacas!

01:11:12.663 --> 01:11:17.566
Did you rip off Johnny Glades?
Lie and I'll rip your head off!

01:11:17.635 --> 01:11:19.125
Me?

01:11:19.203 --> 01:11:21.569
Did you tell anybody
about the buy last night?

01:11:21.639 --> 01:11:25.075
- Look at me, goddamn it!
- I did what I was supposed to.

01:11:25.142 --> 01:11:27.804
Then I split.

01:11:27.878 --> 01:11:31.336
You think those Indians
want me knowing their business?

01:11:31.415 --> 01:11:34.680
Well, somebody found out,
and we could be in deep shit.

01:11:44.528 --> 01:11:46.587
Everybody, we've got
some announcements here.

01:11:46.664 --> 01:11:49.258
The reclamation committee
has generously donated...

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:51.233
some equipment
to Columbus High School.

01:11:51.302 --> 01:11:54.863
They'll be giving it out
on the field in five minutes.

01:11:54.939 --> 01:11:56.804
We've got sports equipment...

01:11:58.142 --> 01:12:02.010
VCRs, laptop computers and books...

01:12:02.079 --> 01:12:05.071
musical instruments, art supplies
and lab equipment.

01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:07.947
And pizza for everybody...
no anchovies.

01:12:15.426 --> 01:12:19.795
You don't teach history anymore.
You are history.

01:12:19.864 --> 01:12:22.230
Don't these people
belong in class?

01:12:36.046 --> 01:12:38.640
Brand-new tubas for the band.

01:12:42.987 --> 01:12:46.013
Jerome, find your best friend
with your wife or something?

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:48.320
Yeah, that's why I divorced her.

01:12:52.163 --> 01:12:55.462
What's up, man?
What's going on?

01:12:55.533 --> 01:12:58.798
I saw how you handled them boys
yesterday. I liked that.

01:12:58.869 --> 01:13:01.099
As a matter of fact,
you're my dog now.

01:13:01.172 --> 01:13:03.265
As a matter of fact,
check it.

01:13:04.642 --> 01:13:07.440
- S-Dog.
- Thanks, Jerome.

01:13:07.511 --> 01:13:09.638
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- No doubt.

01:13:12.449 --> 01:13:13.814
Check you later.

01:13:19.456 --> 01:13:20.684
What?

01:13:21.759 --> 01:13:23.784
Mr. Shale.

01:13:25.996 --> 01:13:28.430
- It's Smith. Be cool.
- Oh, I'm cool.

01:13:28.499 --> 01:13:31.059
So this is a personal mission
or a joint operation...

01:13:31.135 --> 01:13:34.127
between the CIA and the PTA?

01:13:35.739 --> 01:13:37.900
I'm just messing with you.

01:13:37.975 --> 01:13:40.603
You're trying to get the K.O.D.,
and I want to help.

01:13:40.678 --> 01:13:42.942
- Forget it.
- What do you mean?

01:13:43.013 --> 01:13:46.847
You're the great white hope who's
gonna show us how to clean things up?

01:13:46.917 --> 01:13:48.248
This is my school.

01:13:48.319 --> 01:13:51.618
I'm the one that's still
going to be here after you leave.

01:13:51.689 --> 01:13:54.089
If there's a problem,
I want to help.

01:13:54.158 --> 01:13:56.353
All right, Mr. S-Dog?

01:13:56.427 --> 01:13:58.361
All right.

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:00.822
What do you want me to do?

01:14:02.666 --> 01:14:04.395
Nothing.

01:14:04.468 --> 01:14:06.493
The next move is Rolle's.

01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:09.266
Rolle? What does he
got to do with it?

01:14:12.343 --> 01:14:15.141
He's in business with Lacas
and a drug dealer named Johnny Glades.

01:14:15.212 --> 01:14:18.841
- No, man, that's bullshit.
- No, it's true.

01:14:18.916 --> 01:14:22.215
I don't know how they work it yet,
but it's a matter of time.

01:14:22.286 --> 01:14:25.517
The man has done too many things
for the community to be involved...

01:14:25.589 --> 01:14:28.353
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say anything.

01:14:28.425 --> 01:14:30.655
- Now I know what this is about.
- What's that?

01:14:30.728 --> 01:14:34.824
Politics. When you have a black man
running for office, making changes...

01:14:34.898 --> 01:14:37.423
you got a white man
trying to run him down.

01:14:37.501 --> 01:14:39.594
He's dealing drugs, Darryl.

01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:41.604
That's bullshit.

01:14:52.516 --> 01:14:55.178
Johnny, that money you lost?

01:14:55.252 --> 01:14:57.447
I know where it went.

01:15:02.259 --> 01:15:03.692
Beautiful.

01:15:07.197 --> 01:15:10.633
Tilt those little puppies
over here, baby.

01:15:10.701 --> 01:15:12.134
One for you.

01:15:14.004 --> 01:15:15.938
And one for me.

01:15:18.208 --> 01:15:20.733
To the very, very generous
Mr. Smith.

01:15:23.647 --> 01:15:27.276
Hey, what do you expect
from a Harvard, Princeton...

01:15:27.351 --> 01:15:30.081
Cornell, Rutgers, Yale grad?

01:15:31.388 --> 01:15:34.755
It's too bad most of my students
think that Yale is a lock.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:39.454
Okay, let's talk about
this parent-teacher conference.

01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:42.055
Come on, Janie,
I don't want to talk shop tonight.

01:15:42.132 --> 01:15:44.157
It's tomorrow night.
You've got to be briefed.

01:15:44.234 --> 01:15:46.862
I know. I just tell the parents
what the kids are doing.

01:15:46.937 --> 01:15:49.167
- It's so easy.
- I want you to be positive.

01:15:49.239 --> 01:15:53.437
I want you to think of one
good thing for every student.

01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:56.638
You have to educate and encourage
the parents as much as the kids.

01:15:56.714 --> 01:15:59.842
- Oh, God! So itchy.
- Not again.

01:15:59.917 --> 01:16:02.545
Why does it always have to itch
at a spot where I can't reach it?

01:16:02.619 --> 01:16:04.553
Oh, please.

01:16:05.989 --> 01:16:07.923
- Here, let me.
- I can't get it.

01:16:07.991 --> 01:16:10.357
- Let me try from here.
- It's right here.

01:16:14.231 --> 01:16:16.256
Oh, please hurry, Shale.

01:16:19.269 --> 01:16:22.466
Higher, higher. Okay.

01:16:41.158 --> 01:16:45.527
I can't get higher through your...

01:16:45.596 --> 01:16:49.532
I'm going to have to
come in from up top.

01:16:51.068 --> 01:16:52.535
You dog.

01:16:53.437 --> 01:16:56.406
- What?
- "What?"

01:16:56.473 --> 01:16:58.407
You know what.

01:17:00.344 --> 01:17:01.777
Come over here.

01:17:42.019 --> 01:17:43.167
Attention, parents and teachers.

01:17:43.202 --> 01:17:44.316
Attention, parents and teachers.

01:17:44.388 --> 01:17:47.016
School will be closing
in five minutes.

01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:50.253
Five minutes. Thank you.

01:17:56.433 --> 01:17:58.094
Lisa, you're still here.

01:17:58.168 --> 01:18:01.035
Yeah, I was helping Miss Adams
with some refreshments.

01:18:01.104 --> 01:18:03.038
There are some boys outside
that are bugging me.

01:18:03.106 --> 01:18:05.131
Do you mind if I just
wait here for a while?

01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:07.803
Sure, have a seat.
I've got some papers to finish.

01:18:07.878 --> 01:18:10.142
I'll be done in a minute.

01:18:15.352 --> 01:18:17.377
That's all I've got on Arturo.

01:18:17.454 --> 01:18:20.446
Miss Hetzko will have to
fill you in on the rest.

01:18:20.524 --> 01:18:23.584
- Thanks for coming in, Miss Suarez.
- Thank you.

01:19:29.459 --> 01:19:30.892
Yes?

01:19:33.397 --> 01:19:34.830
Good.

01:19:41.605 --> 01:19:44.506
I'm doing good, so I don't know
what else I'm supposed to do.

01:19:44.575 --> 01:19:47.544
If you want, I'll be happy
to talk to her.

01:19:47.611 --> 01:19:49.738
That would be good.

01:19:49.813 --> 01:19:52.748
Huh. What the hell is this?

01:19:52.816 --> 01:19:55.444
Have your mama call me,
and we'll set up a time...

01:19:55.519 --> 01:19:57.453
when we can get toge...

01:19:58.589 --> 01:20:01.183
These doors shouldn't be locked.

01:20:01.258 --> 01:20:05.092
Come on, we'll go out
through the basement.

01:20:07.364 --> 01:20:10.891
There's a security office down here.
They'll let us out.

01:20:14.972 --> 01:20:18.464
- You need a ride home?
- It's not out of your way?

01:20:18.542 --> 01:20:20.533
No, not at all.

01:20:24.281 --> 01:20:25.942
At least an hour and a half.

01:20:26.016 --> 01:20:27.449
Shit.

01:20:37.761 --> 01:20:39.194
Lacas.

01:21:05.489 --> 01:21:08.083
Come on, come on. Down here.

01:21:13.363 --> 01:21:15.831
You guys go that way.
You come with me.

01:21:22.572 --> 01:21:24.767
Whatever happens, stay put.

01:21:24.841 --> 01:21:26.365
- But, Mr. Sherman...
- No, listen.

01:21:26.443 --> 01:21:29.310
Tell Smith everything, okay?

01:21:34.818 --> 01:21:37.343
Got the guy. Over here!

01:21:49.266 --> 01:21:51.291
Here we go.

01:21:52.736 --> 01:21:54.670
Come down. You're going to
make me go up there and get you?

01:21:54.738 --> 01:21:57.866
- Where are you going, Darryl?
- Fuck you, Rolle!

01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:07.181
You're going down, Rolle.
Smith is putting you away.

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:09.741
Smith's dead, Darryl.
Drive-by. Very ugly.

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:11.082
You're a liar!

01:22:11.154 --> 01:22:13.918
I know. It upset me too.

01:22:14.658 --> 01:22:17.354
Give it up, Darryl.
It's over, get it?

01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:28.233
Nice aim.

01:22:28.305 --> 01:22:30.398
Fuck you, Rolle!

01:22:32.309 --> 01:22:35.836
Shame you have to end up this way,
crawling like a worm.

01:22:37.047 --> 01:22:38.412
That's how you lived,
so why not?

01:22:38.482 --> 01:22:41.076
At least I didn't sell out
my own people!

01:22:41.151 --> 01:22:42.618
Sell out?

01:22:44.621 --> 01:22:46.680
I look at you,
and you know what I see?

01:22:47.758 --> 01:22:51.091
I see me when I was young
and stupid.

01:22:51.161 --> 01:22:52.856
I see me when I was soft.

01:22:53.764 --> 01:22:56.961
That just don't cut it.

01:23:00.036 --> 01:23:02.596
Young man...

01:23:02.672 --> 01:23:05.266
I'm just doing you a favor.

01:23:45.816 --> 01:23:47.306
Who died?

01:23:48.752 --> 01:23:49.912
You did, sir.

01:23:51.788 --> 01:23:53.483
I guess I am a little late.

01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:16.342
Mr. Smith, what's going on?

01:24:16.413 --> 01:24:18.881
They said you got wasted
in some drive-by.

01:24:18.949 --> 01:24:20.780
- Who said that?
- Rolle.

01:24:20.851 --> 01:24:22.978
The principal made an announcement
over the loudspeaker this morning.

01:24:23.053 --> 01:24:25.920
- That's what we heard.
- Told us about Sherman too.

01:24:25.989 --> 01:24:29.481
- What about Mr. Sherman?
- Somebody found his body.

01:24:29.559 --> 01:24:31.493
- Wasted.
- Shot in the head.

01:24:31.561 --> 01:24:33.927
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:24:35.432 --> 01:24:39.198
- Let's take this guy out right here.
- Like you did last time?

01:24:39.269 --> 01:24:42.170
Either he's an undercover cop
or working for the mob.

01:24:42.239 --> 01:24:46.141
- How did he become Hetzko's substitute?
- Maybe you should ask her.

01:24:46.209 --> 01:24:49.474
Harvard, Princeton, my ass.
I should have my head examined.

01:24:49.546 --> 01:24:52.811
I don't know where he is,
Mr. Smith.

01:24:52.883 --> 01:24:57.081
He has nothing on his calendar
until 3:30.

01:24:57.153 --> 01:25:00.281
What's at 3:30?

01:25:00.357 --> 01:25:03.588
A Mr. Wolfson
at the jai alai fronton.

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.685
Thanks.

01:25:07.063 --> 01:25:08.189
Jerome.

01:25:09.933 --> 01:25:14.233
I have to go someplace.
I need you to take over my class.

01:25:14.304 --> 01:25:15.430
You're fucking with me?

01:25:15.505 --> 01:25:17.905
No, I'm counting on you, son.

01:25:22.712 --> 01:25:26.409
Yo, Mr. Smith asked me
to teach you motherfuckers today.

01:25:27.851 --> 01:25:31.252
- Babe, you the teacher?
- Mr. Smith hitting the crack pipe?

01:25:32.522 --> 01:25:34.752
The only crack around here
is in your head.

01:25:34.824 --> 01:25:37.850
I'll keep it open real good
if you don't pay attention.

01:25:38.662 --> 01:25:40.789
I'm Mr. Brown to you now.

01:25:40.864 --> 01:25:42.798
I'm the substitute for Mr. Smith.

01:25:42.866 --> 01:25:45.391
You dis me,
you're dissing Mr. Smith.

01:25:45.468 --> 01:25:48.904
Rodriguez, you're late.
That's one demerit.

01:25:48.972 --> 01:25:51.702
I need to see Mr. Smith.
Where is he?

01:25:51.775 --> 01:25:54.869
Jerome, it's important.

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:32.514
Wolfson!

01:26:33.917 --> 01:26:36.408
Shale, what a surprise.

01:26:37.554 --> 01:26:40.216
Tell me about Rolle
and Johnny Glades.

01:26:41.424 --> 01:26:43.824
Who? I never heard of them.

01:26:43.893 --> 01:26:46.384
You ever heard of getting
a cesta shoved up your ass?

01:26:46.463 --> 01:26:49.398
Jesus Christ, man.
What are you, nuts?

01:26:49.466 --> 01:26:51.764
You can't come into a public place
and threaten people.

01:26:51.835 --> 01:26:54.099
- I'll call the police.
- Go ahead.

01:26:54.170 --> 01:26:56.138
Just hold it right there.

01:26:56.206 --> 01:26:58.333
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

01:26:58.408 --> 01:26:59.739
I will defend myself.

01:27:22.832 --> 01:27:25.300
Okay, you got me.

01:27:25.368 --> 01:27:28.030
- Can we be reasonable about this?
- Sure.

01:27:29.139 --> 01:27:30.333
Jesus!

01:27:30.407 --> 01:27:33.843
- Tell me about Glades and Rolle.
- I don't know anything.

01:27:34.677 --> 01:27:36.770
Ah! Goddamn!

01:27:36.846 --> 01:27:38.313
God, I'm enjoying this.

01:27:38.381 --> 01:27:41.077
Listen to me now.

01:27:41.151 --> 01:27:43.619
All I know is they wanted me
to hire some people...

01:27:43.686 --> 01:27:46.519
to bodyguard the incoming shipment,
and that's all I know.

01:27:46.589 --> 01:27:49.080
Is that the gig
me and Janus were up for?

01:27:49.159 --> 01:27:52.651
I wanted you, Shale. I told him,
"Obviously this guy's the best. "

01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:55.495
Flattery's gonna get you killed.

01:27:56.299 --> 01:27:59.393
How long has Rolle
been on Glade's payroll, huh?

01:27:59.469 --> 01:28:01.494
I don't know. No!

01:28:01.571 --> 01:28:04.563
I know he was getting paid off
when he was a cop.

01:28:04.641 --> 01:28:07.906
When he became a teacher,
they started funneling the drugs...

01:28:07.977 --> 01:28:10.309
through the school,
and that's it.

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:12.211
How'd they do it?

01:28:14.017 --> 01:28:16.542
The K.O.D., I guess.

01:28:16.619 --> 01:28:18.610
The K.O.D., they said.

01:28:18.688 --> 01:28:21.748
But I don't know how they store it
and how they transport it.

01:28:21.825 --> 01:28:23.850
I don't know any of that shit.

01:28:23.927 --> 01:28:27.260
You're killing me!
You have no reason to kill me.

01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:29.821
Once I'm going to be reasonable.

01:28:29.899 --> 01:28:32.891
You're going to leave the country
and not come back, or I'll kill you.

01:28:32.969 --> 01:28:37.030
Otherwise, I'll be unreasonable.
Am I clear?

01:28:37.107 --> 01:28:38.574
If you don't hit me again.

01:28:59.295 --> 01:29:01.229
- You're sure?
- Yeah. Three.

01:29:07.637 --> 01:29:10.629
- Hello?
- It's Jerome and Lisa.

01:29:27.957 --> 01:29:32.792
Mr. Smith,
this is Jane Hetzko.

01:29:32.862 --> 01:29:36.889
I've got those papers graded,
if you could pick them up.

01:29:36.966 --> 01:29:38.058
Thank you.

01:30:30.286 --> 01:30:32.379
- Come here.
- Okay.

01:30:32.455 --> 01:30:34.889
Don't be stupid, you hear me?

01:30:38.261 --> 01:30:39.888
- Who is it?
- Shale.

01:30:41.898 --> 01:30:43.661
- Who's Shale?
- A friend of mine.

01:30:43.733 --> 01:30:46.031
Get rid of him.

01:30:46.102 --> 01:30:49.936
- I can't talk to you now.
- I brought you something from Smith.

01:30:50.006 --> 01:30:52.133
Okay, buzz him in.

01:31:00.450 --> 01:31:01.644
I'll be right here.

01:31:11.294 --> 01:31:13.194
Take the package.

01:31:16.065 --> 01:31:18.431
- Hi.
- Hola.

01:31:20.803 --> 01:31:23.271
Shale, the kids!

01:31:29.012 --> 01:31:31.572
Mr. Whatever Your Name Is,
you're in my classroom now.

01:31:34.984 --> 01:31:37.214
- You're no teacher. Who are you?
- Leave him alone!

01:31:39.188 --> 01:31:40.450
Stay down.

01:31:40.523 --> 01:31:43.754
- Who is he?
- He's a merc.

01:31:45.128 --> 01:31:49.394
A merc?
You hired a fucking merc?

01:31:49.465 --> 01:31:50.955
Get me the phone.

01:31:52.602 --> 01:31:53.665
I don't know what he's after,
who he's working for.

01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:54.728
I don't know what he's after,
who he's working for.

01:31:54.804 --> 01:31:58.035
All I know is he wanted to know
if you two had a deal.

01:31:58.107 --> 01:32:00.234
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:02.938
You think I'd be here
if I told him anything?

01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:07.416
- Do you know this Shale guy?
- Yeah, he did the Cuba raid.

01:32:07.483 --> 01:32:09.974
He's the guy I told you about
at Wolfsors place.

01:32:10.053 --> 01:32:11.953
The guy that made you
shit in your pants.

01:32:12.021 --> 01:32:14.751
Again with that.
That was the fiber.

01:32:16.626 --> 01:32:18.753
- I need my money now.
- What's the hurry?

01:32:18.828 --> 01:32:22.696
I have a plane to catch
in 40 minutes. My father...

01:32:22.765 --> 01:32:25.165
He's extremely ill,
and I have to go see him.

01:32:26.336 --> 01:32:28.270
Get him his money.

01:32:34.711 --> 01:32:38.579
Sounds like this Smith
and Shale are working together.

01:32:38.648 --> 01:32:42.140
Right. A merc working
with a high school teacher?

01:32:42.218 --> 01:32:44.311
He's not a teacher.
That's a cover.

01:32:44.387 --> 01:32:47.185
He's either a narc or a dealer
trying to muscle in.

01:32:53.329 --> 01:32:55.297
Yeah, hello. Talk.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.434
You're shitting me.

01:33:00.937 --> 01:33:02.928
You've got to be shitting me.

01:33:05.074 --> 01:33:07.838
I don't care who he is.
When we hang up, kill him.

01:33:14.183 --> 01:33:15.775
Are we enjoying this?

01:33:17.253 --> 01:33:20.654
Jane, what's all the racket?

01:33:21.724 --> 01:33:25.057
- It's my landlady.
- Will you open up?

01:33:25.128 --> 01:33:27.062
Get rid of her
or she dies too.

01:33:32.902 --> 01:33:35.666
- What's all the banging in there?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Andrewson.

01:33:35.738 --> 01:33:37.968
- I had the TV on too loud.
- What's wrong with your face?

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.668
I'm fine.
I'll turn the TV down.

01:33:46.215 --> 01:33:47.842
Take him out!

01:33:47.917 --> 01:33:49.043
Goddamn it, take him out!

01:33:54.223 --> 01:33:56.589
Give it up!

01:33:58.661 --> 01:34:00.322
Drop it or she dies.

01:34:01.130 --> 01:34:02.563
Now!

01:34:05.435 --> 01:34:08.427
Slow. Now back up.

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.503
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

01:34:18.981 --> 01:34:20.346
Lights out, motherfucker.

01:34:51.214 --> 01:34:53.978
It's not your fault.

01:35:04.193 --> 01:35:06.218
What were you two
doing here anyway?

01:35:07.463 --> 01:35:09.954
- Looking for you.
- Why?

01:35:11.567 --> 01:35:15.298
Rolle was bringing in dope on buses
and storing it in the boiler room.

01:35:16.205 --> 01:35:19.800
Mr. Sherman led them away from me
so they wouldn't find me.

01:35:19.876 --> 01:35:22.436
That's when they killed him.

01:35:33.422 --> 01:35:35.356
Stay here. It'll be safe.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.390
Where are you going?

01:35:40.463 --> 01:35:44.422
I have to go to the high school.
I've got to get the drugs.

01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.730
You think Rolle and Johnny Glades
are going to let you...

01:35:46.802 --> 01:35:50.397
just walk in and take their drugs?

01:35:50.473 --> 01:35:52.703
If we get there first.

01:36:01.183 --> 01:36:03.879
There's a key to the house.

01:36:03.953 --> 01:36:05.215
If anything happens to me...

01:36:06.355 --> 01:36:08.550
I want you to have this place.

01:36:13.963 --> 01:36:16.397
I don't want you to go.

01:36:20.036 --> 01:36:21.230
I'll be back, Jane.

01:36:23.272 --> 01:36:26.070
You better.

01:36:26.142 --> 01:36:27.234
I will.

01:36:57.106 --> 01:36:58.596
Goodness!

01:37:05.648 --> 01:37:07.741
He thinks he's funny, don't he?

01:37:11.487 --> 01:37:12.784
Joey, get that.

01:37:20.329 --> 01:37:21.421
Hello?

01:37:23.165 --> 01:37:24.257
Yeah.

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:27.359
Louie Beaver says he's seen
Shale and some other guys...

01:37:27.436 --> 01:37:29.904
going into the school.

01:37:29.972 --> 01:37:32.202
Tell them to sit tight
and keep a lookout.

01:37:53.329 --> 01:37:54.455
Oh, shit.

01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:07.275
Car approaching north perimeter.

01:38:08.477 --> 01:38:10.411
Be right there.

01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.979
Looks like we got our company.

01:38:13.049 --> 01:38:16.485
Don't worry. I'll throw them
a real nice surprise party.

01:38:16.552 --> 01:38:17.985
Good.

01:38:42.278 --> 01:38:44.769
That's far enough right there,
Rolle.

01:38:47.516 --> 01:38:49.609
Just take it easy.

01:38:49.685 --> 01:38:51.880
I just want to make a deal.

01:38:51.954 --> 01:38:53.717
Your deal sucks, Mr. Principal.

01:38:53.789 --> 01:38:55.950
Then tell us your terms.

01:38:56.025 --> 01:38:59.324
Quite simple: I want it all.

01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:01.321
Keep him talking.

01:39:01.397 --> 01:39:04.764
- I can't do that, Shale.
- It's done, Claude.

01:39:04.834 --> 01:39:07.598
You start anything now, you'll
bring the cops down on all of us.

01:39:07.670 --> 01:39:09.900
Don't worry about the cops.
They're taken care of.

01:39:09.972 --> 01:39:11.906
Anyway, you need us, Shale.

01:39:11.974 --> 01:39:13.908
For what?

01:39:13.976 --> 01:39:16.809
You won't be able to work
without our distribution system.

01:39:16.879 --> 01:39:18.847
What's so good about it?

01:39:18.914 --> 01:39:22.213
It's foolproof...
we bus it in, store it...

01:39:23.252 --> 01:39:25.550
use the K.O.D. To mainline it
directly into the school system.

01:39:25.621 --> 01:39:27.282
You can't do better than that.

01:39:27.356 --> 01:39:29.847
They said busing would never work.

01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:34.088
Sniper in the palm tree.

01:40:13.602 --> 01:40:16.901
There's more company moving in.

01:40:16.972 --> 01:40:18.064
There are two groups.

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.267
Janus and his men
are going around the back.

01:40:20.342 --> 01:40:21.969
Hollan, watch your back
down there.

01:40:25.381 --> 01:40:27.713
And also around the side.

01:41:08.490 --> 01:41:10.651
Oh, shit!

01:41:20.269 --> 01:41:22.260
Move it!

01:41:28.110 --> 01:41:29.338
Let's go!

01:42:03.879 --> 01:42:05.972
The lock is broken.
Check the stuff.

01:42:06.048 --> 01:42:07.481
Hurry!

01:43:24.326 --> 01:43:25.623
Smile.

01:43:25.694 --> 01:43:28.060
You're on candid camera.

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.964
All right, Shale, you got me.
What are you gonna do?

01:43:34.036 --> 01:43:35.970
I'm gonna put you
on my demo reel.

01:43:37.373 --> 01:43:40.342
Now, walk over to the blackboard
and face it.

01:43:42.244 --> 01:43:43.677
Easy.

01:43:45.447 --> 01:43:46.607
"I'm sorey"?

01:43:48.150 --> 01:43:51.415
It's a special mantra for flunkies.
Put the weapon down.

01:44:41.036 --> 01:44:42.367
Boom.

01:44:49.211 --> 01:44:50.644
Rem?

01:44:53.215 --> 01:44:55.149
Wellman.

01:44:56.785 --> 01:44:58.377
- Shit.
- Shale.

01:44:58.454 --> 01:45:00.718
I got four dead cowboys here...

01:45:00.789 --> 01:45:03.383
and one very fucked-up-looking
Indian, Johnny Glades.

01:45:03.459 --> 01:45:06.257
Can I put him out of his misery,
pretty please?

01:45:06.328 --> 01:45:09.263
No, wait 'til I get there,
Hollan.

01:45:13.435 --> 01:45:15.369
You hear that, Johnny?

01:45:15.437 --> 01:45:19.100
As soon as Shale gets here,
I'm gonna scalp you, motherfucker.

01:45:24.913 --> 01:45:27.541
You know what you look like
with that shit all over your face?

01:45:27.616 --> 01:45:30.449
You look like a little snow angel
at the top of a Christ...

01:45:38.994 --> 01:45:41.292
Shale, watch out. It's a trap.

01:45:47.269 --> 01:45:48.827
Watch that door.

01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:52.634
Where the fuck is he?

01:46:16.565 --> 01:46:18.055
Drop them.

01:46:27.943 --> 01:46:29.877
Where's my guy?

01:48:23.091 --> 01:48:25.025
Get up!

01:48:32.701 --> 01:48:35.431
Who are you working for, Shale?
Who are you working for?

01:48:35.504 --> 01:48:37.836
- Myself.
- Yeah, right. A great teacher.

01:48:37.906 --> 01:48:40.534
You're a mercenary, in it for
the money like everybody else.

01:48:40.609 --> 01:48:43.009
- It was never about the money.
- It's always about the money.

01:48:43.078 --> 01:48:45.046
If it's not about the money,
what else is there?

01:48:46.648 --> 01:48:50.448
I'd try to explain it to you,
but some things just can't be taught.

01:49:24.152 --> 01:49:25.585
Oh, God.

01:49:26.655 --> 01:49:27.917
I thought I lost you.

01:49:27.989 --> 01:49:30.355
Not this time, Joey.

01:49:35.997 --> 01:49:37.726
Rem and Wellman?

01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:46.669
Hollan too.

01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:56.747
You're just gonna stand there...

01:49:56.818 --> 01:49:59.446
bleeding and shit,
making a mess?

01:50:02.357 --> 01:50:04.291
Let's get out of here.

01:50:07.062 --> 01:50:10.259
Cops have got great response time.
What'd it take them, three hours?

01:50:10.332 --> 01:50:13.233
Rolle said they were on his payroll.
What do you expect?

01:50:13.301 --> 01:50:16.896
It's definitely time to relocate.

01:50:16.972 --> 01:50:18.462
Yeah.

01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.633
It's too bad we had to
fuck up the school.

01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:22.700
I feel bad for the kids tomorrow.

01:50:22.778 --> 01:50:25.406
They'll be okay.
At least it's their school again.

01:50:27.616 --> 01:50:31.279
Yeah. Where the hell
are we gonna go, man?

01:50:31.353 --> 01:50:34.186
Ah, how does L.A. Sound?

01:50:34.256 --> 01:50:36.190
Like more palm trees.

01:50:36.258 --> 01:50:38.249
I hear the schools out there
have a major drug problem.

01:50:38.326 --> 01:50:41.887
No. No more schools, man.
Forget it.

01:50:41.963 --> 01:50:44.659
- You could teach P.E.
- P.E.?

01:50:44.733 --> 01:50:46.530
What, I look retarded?

01:50:46.601 --> 01:50:49.331
- Okay, math.
- Fuck that.
