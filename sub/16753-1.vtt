Room.237.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFY

01:06.984 --> 01:11.279
- The poster
that came out in Europe,

01:11.280 --> 01:12.497
at least in England,
I believe,

01:12.498 --> 01:18.160
before the movie was released
in Europe said,

01:18.161 --> 01:22.331
"The wave of terror
that swept across America."

01:22.332 --> 01:25.506
And Kubrick controlled
the posters very carefully.

01:25.507 --> 01:28.671
Now,
it made you do a double take.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.089
I remember seeing it in Europe.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.637
I was the Rome Bureau Chief
at the time for ABC News.

01:31.638 --> 01:33.009
And I remember looking at it.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.512
It said, "The wave of terror
that swept across America."

01:34.513 --> 01:36.512
What's he talking about?

01:36.513 --> 01:41.267
And you'd sort of think
that he was talking about

01:41.268 --> 01:43.362
the impact
of the book The Shining.

01:43.363 --> 01:44.604
Maybe.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.324
The impact of the movie
that had just opened over there?

01:47.325 --> 01:48.316
Maybe.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.859
It didn't quite fit.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.658
The wave of terror
that swept across America

01:51.659 --> 01:53.906
from Portland, Maine,
to Portland, Oregon,

01:53.907 --> 01:56.704
was the genocidal armies
and the white men with their ax

01:56.705 --> 02:00.786
clearing it all and bringing in
extractive industries,

02:00.787 --> 02:02.288
among many other good things
as well.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.542
But that was the wave of terror
that swept across America,

02:04.543 --> 02:08.216
terrifying, of course,
the American Indians.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.281
- I went in to see this movie in
Leicester Square Movie Theater,

02:34.282 --> 02:36.619
right near
Leicester Square in London.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.454
And I remember it
quite clearly from...

02:38.455 --> 02:40.496
I can even remember the seats
we were sitting in.

02:40.497 --> 02:42.872
If I went back to that theater,
I could point them to you,

02:42.873 --> 02:47.500
sort of near the back
and over to the left.

02:47.501 --> 02:51.381
From the moment of the opening
astonishing helicopter shot,

02:51.382 --> 02:53.255
I was terrified.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.882
I had no idea what was coming.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.726
I remember sort of sitting
on the front edge

02:56.727 --> 03:01.263
of my theater seat there
to keep from falling off.

03:01.264 --> 03:05.144
And I remember gripping my
belt buckle with my left hand,

03:05.145 --> 03:06.435
I think it was...

03:06.436 --> 03:09.440
yes, my left hand,
sort of to keep from falling off

03:09.441 --> 03:14.443
the edge of the seat
and to try to control my terror

03:14.444 --> 03:15.739
as I watched this movie.

03:15.740 --> 03:17.113
I had no idea what was coming.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.327
I hadn't read the book.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.746
I had barely seen
any of the posters.

03:20.747 --> 03:25.871
And I remember that I was
stunned when the movie was over.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.624
We left the theater, went in...

03:28.625 --> 03:30.468
down into
our underground car park

03:30.469 --> 03:34.004
to get into the car to leave.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.804
And as we were driving up
out of the car park,

03:36.805 --> 03:39.468
I was sitting
in the back left seat.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.554
I was thinking, "What was that?
What was that?

03:41.555 --> 03:42.555
"What was it?
What was it?

03:42.556 --> 03:43.597
What was it?"

03:43.598 --> 03:47.435
And I think
my visual imagination

03:47.436 --> 03:49.109
looked at that
Calumet baking powder can,

03:49.110 --> 03:50.651
the one right behind
Hallorann's head

03:50.652 --> 03:52.898
when he was talking to Danny.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.196
I knew what "calumet" meant.

03:54.197 --> 03:56.694
It meant "peace pipe."

03:56.695 --> 04:01.157
And I thought to myself,
"peace pipe, Indians.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.450
"Oh, my goodness,

04:02.451 --> 04:04.499
they're all over the place
in that movie."

04:11.209 --> 04:13.928
- The loser
has to keep America clean.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.635
- And I suddenly
said to my friends,

04:21.636 --> 04:23.100
"That movie
was about the genocide

04:23.101 --> 04:24.560
of the American Indians."

04:24.561 --> 04:26.727
And they said,
"What are you talking about?"

04:26.728 --> 04:28.064
And I started explaining it,

04:28.065 --> 04:30.811
because I'd noticed
the Calumet baking soda can.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.860
In the first... the first time
we seen one,

04:32.861 --> 04:36.108
it's a single
baking powder can straight on.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.985
And you can see the whole word,
"Calumet,"

04:37.986 --> 04:40.196
so there's no duplicity,

04:40.197 --> 04:41.915
like the little girls
represent later.

04:41.916 --> 04:43.824
This is an honest truth,

04:43.825 --> 04:45.910
an honest peace pipe
between them.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.629
The other time we see
the Calumet baking powder cans

04:47.630 --> 04:49.874
is when they're
very carefully placed

04:49.875 --> 04:53.673
behind Jack Nicholson's head
when he's talking to Grady.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.634
- No need to rub it in,
Mr. Grady.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.058
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

05:06.059 --> 05:08.808
- There's about six
or seven of them stacked up,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.398
and they're
all turned different ways,

05:10.399 --> 05:12.564
and you can't read
any one of them completely.

05:12.565 --> 05:15.657
It's... I've always interpreted
those as being broken,

05:15.658 --> 05:18.067
dishonest peace pipe treaties.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.072
They're not... these two guys,
Grady and Jack,

05:21.073 --> 05:24.156
are not being honest
with each other.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.909
Grady is trying to get Jack
to go kill his family

05:26.910 --> 05:28.249
and commit genocide,

05:28.250 --> 05:29.747
in the larger sense
of the movie.

05:29.748 --> 05:32.039
You know, I mean,
Kubrick often,

05:32.040 --> 05:35.376
in many of his movies,

05:35.377 --> 05:37.048
he will end them
with a puzzle

05:37.049 --> 05:39.764
so that he forces you to go out
of the theater saying,

05:39.765 --> 05:41.632
"What was that about?"

05:41.633 --> 05:44.718
And he would put things
in the scenes

05:44.719 --> 05:46.266
that he knows will be,
among other things,

05:46.267 --> 05:49.312
like confirmers when people
start to try to figure out

05:49.313 --> 05:51.100
what the movie is about.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.894
And we know he took
this kind of care.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.896
There's a photograph
in one of the books

05:55.897 --> 05:57.523
that actually shows Kubrick

05:57.524 --> 05:59.367
carefully arranging
objects on the shelves

05:59.368 --> 06:01.861
in that dry goods room.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.487
I thought afterwards,

06:03.488 --> 06:06.617
"How come I saw this and
a lot of other people didn't?"

06:06.618 --> 06:08.409
And I've thought about it.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.749
It's a combination of factors.

06:09.750 --> 06:12.588
First, I grew up in Chicago
and, therefore,

06:12.589 --> 06:14.957
just north
of the Calumet Harbor

06:14.958 --> 06:19.420
and spent summers up
in the sand dunes of Michigan,

06:19.421 --> 06:21.139
around on the other side
of Lake Michigan.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.302
My father
took me and my sister out

06:23.303 --> 06:25.885
to collect little bits
of Indian pottery.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.308
I'd already...
I'd already covered,

06:27.309 --> 06:28.846
at that point in 1980,

06:28.847 --> 06:31.807
five years
of the Lebanese civil war.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.186
I was, at that point,
covering John Paul ll.

06:34.187 --> 06:35.686
I was the Rome Bureau Chief.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.609
And listening
to what he was saying about...

06:38.610 --> 06:41.235
because he had experienced
the Holocaust at its epicenter

06:41.236 --> 06:43.360
and also other horrors.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.405
And so all of those factors

06:46.406 --> 06:48.532
were very much alive in my mind

06:48.533 --> 06:50.326
when we went
to see The Shining,

06:50.327 --> 06:52.705
which I just thought was going
to be some kind of horror movie

06:52.706 --> 06:53.704
by this great moviemaker.

06:53.705 --> 06:58.626
And all of those coming together
along with the little key,

06:58.627 --> 07:01.503
the Calumet baking soda can,

07:01.504 --> 07:04.173
is why I just happened
to tune to it

07:04.174 --> 07:08.969
as we were driving up out of
that underground parking garage

07:08.970 --> 07:10.187
just off Leicester Square.

07:13.183 --> 07:16.733
- I first saw the movie in 1980
when it first came out

07:16.734 --> 07:19.605
and saw it probably two times.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.777
I can say that I remembered
the skier poster.

07:21.778 --> 07:24.198
That is one thing
that really stuck with me.

07:24.199 --> 07:26.028
And the window.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.368
The window in the office,

07:27.369 --> 07:29.537
that's another thing
that really stuck with me.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.582
I remember, you know,
in the newspapers afterwards,

07:34.583 --> 07:35.749
people being disappointed.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.498
And I remember people
that I knew,

07:37.499 --> 07:39.092
yes, in dialogue afterwards,

07:39.093 --> 07:42.920
being disappointed that it was
not more a horror film.

07:42.921 --> 07:47.257
Well, no Kubrick film's
really just a regular movie.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.093
I understood that from,

07:49.094 --> 07:51.893
well, when I was 10 years old
and I first saw 2001.

07:51.894 --> 07:52.888
I walked away.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.434
I thought, "This is a film

07:54.435 --> 07:56.480
that's supposed
to make me think."

07:58.770 --> 08:02.231
- I had my first
religious experience

08:02.232 --> 08:07.778
seeing the film
2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968.

08:07.779 --> 08:14.243
I was a smart kid
and liked art,

08:14.244 --> 08:16.578
but I really
did not like movies

08:16.579 --> 08:20.249
and thought that they
were really a substandard art.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.752
And, you know, films like

08:21.753 --> 08:24.795
My Fair Lady
and Doctor Dolittle were out.

08:24.796 --> 08:29.925
And it was a rather pathetic
time in the '60s for films.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.428
And my girlfriend,
she pulled up

08:32.429 --> 08:36.097
and told me that she'd
seen a movie the night before

08:36.099 --> 08:38.100
and she wanted to see it again.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.945
So she took me to the theater,
the Cinerama Dome,

08:40.946 --> 08:42.479
and I watched it.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.817
And I had never in my life
envisioned that a movie

08:46.818 --> 08:49.278
could do what this movie
was doing.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.123
And it was showing me things
that I had never seen,

08:52.124 --> 08:54.783
and it was
intellectually challenging.

08:54.784 --> 08:59.621
And it was an artistic
masterpiece in every way,

08:59.622 --> 09:04.126
from the soundtrack to
the visuals to the story line.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.051
And when the movie ended,
I couldn't get out of my seat.

09:07.052 --> 09:09.465
I was frozen in the seat,

09:09.466 --> 09:13.093
completely paralyzed
by what I'd just witnessed.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.722
And the usher actually
had to come and get me out.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.433
And I was the last person,
me and her.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.852
And I staggered
out of the theater

09:21.853 --> 09:24.563
completely changed
as a human being

09:24.564 --> 09:25.816
and decided at that moment

09:25.817 --> 09:27.816
that the only thing
that I wanted to do

09:27.817 --> 09:29.485
for the rest of my life

09:29.486 --> 09:32.988
was to make films
in one fashion or another.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.115
And so I have done that.

09:35.116 --> 09:40.037
So I owe Stanley Kubrick and
his film 2001: A Space Odyssey

09:40.038 --> 09:44.708
everything for everything that
I have become in my life, so...

10:02.018 --> 10:03.861
- I saw a number
of Kubrick films

10:03.862 --> 10:06.980
before I had
an academic interest in him.

10:06.981 --> 10:11.527
And then I went to see
The Shining in 1980.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.368
And frankly,
I didn't think that much of it.

10:14.369 --> 10:16.867
I thought the other
Kubrick films that I'd seen

10:16.868 --> 10:19.868
were far superior.

10:19.869 --> 10:24.581
But as I thought
about the film afterwards...

10:24.582 --> 10:26.753
and even when
I wasn't thinking about it...

10:26.754 --> 10:29.004
there were things
that bothered me about it.

10:29.005 --> 10:32.214
It seemed
as if I had missed something.

10:32.215 --> 10:35.384
And so I went back
to see it again.

10:35.385 --> 10:39.054
And I began to see
patterns and details

10:39.055 --> 10:42.057
that I hadn't noticed before.

10:42.058 --> 10:46.395
And so I kept watching the film
again and again and again.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.356
And since
I'm trained as an historian

10:49.357 --> 10:51.817
and my special expertise

10:51.818 --> 10:56.697
is in the history of Germany
and Nazi Germany in particular,

10:56.698 --> 10:58.291
I became
more and more convinced

10:58.292 --> 11:02.077
that there is,
in this film,

11:02.078 --> 11:06.049
a deeply laid subtext
that takes on The Holocaust.

11:07.917 --> 11:12.838
I think
it probably was the typewriter,

11:12.839 --> 11:16.925
which was a German brand,
which might seem arbitrary,

11:16.926 --> 11:20.387
but by that time,
I knew enough about Kubrick

11:20.388 --> 11:26.101
that most anything in his films
can't be regarded as arbitrary,

11:26.102 --> 11:29.149
that anything...
especially objects and colors

11:29.150 --> 11:33.027
and music and anything else,
probably have some intentional

11:33.028 --> 11:36.111
as well as
unintentional meaning to them.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.329
And so that struck me.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.072
Why a German typewriter?

11:39.073 --> 11:41.158
And in connection with that,

11:41.159 --> 11:47.039
I began to see the number 42
appear in the film.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.834
And for a German historian,
if you put the number 42

11:50.835 --> 11:53.088
and a German typewriter
together,

11:53.089 --> 11:54.463
you get the Holocaust,

11:54.464 --> 11:59.885
because it was in 1942
that the Nazis made the decision

11:59.886 --> 12:03.513
to go ahead and exterminate
all the Jews they could.

12:03.514 --> 12:07.267
And they did so in
a highly mechanical, industrial,

12:07.268 --> 12:09.728
and bureaucratic way.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.649
And so the juxtaposition
of the number 42

12:13.650 --> 12:16.574
and the typewriter was really
where it started for me

12:16.575 --> 12:19.988
in terms of the historical
content of the film.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.491
Of course "adler"
in German means "eagle."

12:22.492 --> 12:24.995
And eagle, of course,
is a symbol of Nazi Germany.

12:24.996 --> 12:27.290
It's also a symbol
of the United States.

12:27.291 --> 12:29.507
And Kubrick
generally has recourse to eagles

12:29.508 --> 12:31.297
to symbolize state power.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.217
Kubrick read Raul Hilberg's

12:40.218 --> 12:42.558
The Destruction
of the European Jews.

12:42.559 --> 12:44.897
And Hilberg's
major theme in there

12:44.898 --> 12:49.559
is that he focuses
on the apparatus of killing.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.154
And he emphasizes
how bureaucratic it was

12:52.155 --> 12:56.191
and how it was a matter
of lists and typewriters.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.819
Spielberg picked that up in
Schindler's List, of course.

12:58.820 --> 13:02.572
I mean, the film begins
with typewriters and lists

13:02.573 --> 13:04.700
and ends with a list,
of course.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.119
And so that informs...

13:07.120 --> 13:09.835
and I had a chance
to talk to Raul Hilberg.

13:09.836 --> 13:11.170
He visited Albion College.

13:11.171 --> 13:13.542
And he said that he and Kubrick
corresponded about this.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.672
And the fact that he read it
then, in the 1970s,

13:16.673 --> 13:19.049
when there was a big wave
of interest in Hitler

13:19.050 --> 13:22.342
and the Holocaust and the Nazis,
I think...

13:22.343 --> 13:25.387
I think just tells us
that that typewriter,

13:25.388 --> 13:27.014
that German typewriter...

13:27.015 --> 13:30.144
which by the way, changes color
in the course of the film,

13:30.145 --> 13:32.733
which typewriters
don't generally do...

13:32.734 --> 13:34.857
is terribly,
terribly important

13:34.858 --> 13:37.700
as a referent to that
particular historical event.

13:50.580 --> 13:54.124
- I worked in a film archive
for a decade,

13:54.125 --> 13:56.918
kind of like
fast-forwarding

13:56.919 --> 14:01.256
through World War II
ten times a day.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.008
But, you know, like,
when you see things

14:03.009 --> 14:04.676
over and over and again,

14:04.677 --> 14:06.553
their meanings change for you.

14:06.554 --> 14:14.853
Like, when you see these... see,
like, World War ll newsreels,

14:14.854 --> 14:17.606
like, after a while,
you come to realize

14:17.607 --> 14:20.400
that it's all faked on film.

14:20.401 --> 14:25.197
You are not seeing troops
storming Normandy.

14:25.198 --> 14:30.285
You're seeing troops
storming a beach in Hollywood.

14:30.286 --> 14:35.123
You know, like, you're not
seeing a plane flying to Japan.

14:35.124 --> 14:40.130
You're seeing a plane flying
over, you know, New Mexico.

14:42.298 --> 14:46.098
What you're really being shown
is, like, staged heroism.

14:46.099 --> 14:50.680
You know, like, you're seeing
men moving with machines,

14:50.681 --> 14:54.059
but you're not seeing what
they're talking about.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.781
And I think that that's
something that Kubrick plays on.

14:57.782 --> 15:02.901
Like, he plays on your
acceptance of visual infor...

15:02.902 --> 15:06.321
and also your ignorance
of visual information.

15:06.322 --> 15:10.742
Like he'll often, like,
put little special clues

15:10.743 --> 15:13.838
that you see,
like, in the corner.

15:17.291 --> 15:21.503
Every scene,
there's an impossibility,

15:21.504 --> 15:24.840
like the TV doesn't have a cord

15:24.841 --> 15:27.390
or even something as simple as,
like, them...

15:27.391 --> 15:30.846
they, like...
they bring too much luggage up.

15:30.847 --> 15:34.558
They, like... Jack, you know,
glances over at a pile

15:34.559 --> 15:36.027
of their luggage
that they brought,

15:36.028 --> 15:39.271
and ifs about the size
of a car.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.272
You know, a lot of it is jokes.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.191
Like, they're taking the tour.

15:43.192 --> 15:47.612
They're crossing the street
from the maze

15:47.613 --> 15:49.453
to go check out the garage.

15:49.454 --> 15:52.534
Like, a car
is just about to hit them.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.536
And then it cuts right before.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.842
- I had anticipated the film

16:08.843 --> 16:11.553
and had read
the Stephen King novel

16:11.554 --> 16:16.057
before the film came out and
found it a very appealing story.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.393
And I had spent
a lot of time

16:18.394 --> 16:23.231
at the Stanley Hotel
in Estes Park, Colorado,

16:23.232 --> 16:27.157
which is where he was inspired
to write the book The Shining.

16:27.158 --> 16:31.406
And so I, you know... I knew
a little bit of the background.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.246
And when
Kubrick's film came out,

16:33.247 --> 16:35.586
I was first in line to see it,
of course.

16:35.587 --> 16:38.872
And I was just
really disappointed

16:38.873 --> 16:40.999
and walked out of the theater

16:41.000 --> 16:43.674
wondering what the hell
I had just witnessed.

16:43.675 --> 16:50.675
And, I... actually,
my reverence for Stanley Kubrick

16:50.676 --> 16:52.678
diminished after that.

16:54.430 --> 16:58.600
I was disappointed, but I still
watched it every few years.

16:58.601 --> 17:02.105
I couldn't understand why I was
so attracted to watching a film

17:02.106 --> 17:04.105
that I actually didn't like.

17:04.106 --> 17:08.026
And now
in all these years later,

17:08.027 --> 17:11.613
I know why it is a great film.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.073
It is a masterpiece,

17:13.074 --> 17:15.667
but not for the reasons
that most people think.

17:19.829 --> 17:25.126
We are dealing with a guy
who has a 200 IQ.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.837
I believe
that when Stanley Kubrick

17:27.838 --> 17:33.343
finished with Barry Lyndon,
he was bored.

17:33.344 --> 17:36.846
He had conquered
the filmmaking landscape.

17:36.847 --> 17:41.518
He had succeeded in making
masterpiece after masterpiece,

17:41.519 --> 17:44.354
and he was bored.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.065
Barry Lyndon
is a boring movie.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.613
It is wonderfully shot.

17:48.614 --> 17:50.610
It is beautifully costumed.

17:50.611 --> 17:54.739
But it is a film
made by a guy who is bored.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.450
And I could see that.

17:57.451 --> 18:01.830
And so I think Stanley
retreated after Barry Lyndon.

18:01.831 --> 18:06.960
And he began working on
a new kind of film,

18:06.961 --> 18:11.214
a film that
had never been made before,

18:11.215 --> 18:14.509
a film that was made
by a bored genius

18:14.510 --> 18:21.099
who had thoroughly
emptied the jug of everything

18:21.100 --> 18:23.319
that could be done
in filmmaking.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.146
And he was looking
for the next thing.

18:26.147 --> 18:31.526
And what he did was he began
reading Subliminal Seduction

18:31.527 --> 18:34.952
and a number of other books
which were about how advertisers

18:34.953 --> 18:37.866
were injecting...

18:37.867 --> 18:40.827
injecting images,
subliminal images,

18:40.828 --> 18:44.581
into advertising
to sell products more.

18:44.582 --> 18:48.293
- Suggestible trends.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.218
- You know, there'll be
an ad for Gilbey's Gin,

18:51.219 --> 18:55.216
and inside, the ice cubes
will be various sex organs

18:55.217 --> 19:00.815
and things to add
a subliminal appeal to the ad.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.935
Kubrick went
to these advertisers,

19:05.936 --> 19:09.064
and he asked them
what their methods were.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.107
And then he took those methods

19:11.108 --> 19:15.153
and he applied them
to The Shining.

19:15.154 --> 19:19.574
Inside The Shining are
hundreds of subliminal images

19:19.575 --> 19:22.410
and shot line-ups.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.830
And what
these images are telling

19:25.831 --> 19:32.379
is an extremely disturbing
story about sexuality.

19:32.380 --> 19:36.549
And the subtext of the story,

19:36.550 --> 19:40.053
besides the other subtexts
of the story,

19:40.054 --> 19:46.559
is a story of haunted
phantoms and demons

19:46.560 --> 19:52.107
who are sexually attracted
to humans

19:52.108 --> 19:55.610
and are feeding off of them.

19:55.611 --> 20:00.490
You'd have to be able to be
a complete fanatic like I am

20:00.491 --> 20:02.117
in order to find all this,

20:02.118 --> 20:04.587
but, you know,
I'll give you my favorite.

20:04.588 --> 20:08.790
I'm only gonna give you one,
but I'll give you my favorite.

20:08.791 --> 20:12.669
When Jack meets
Stewart Ullman in the office

20:12.670 --> 20:14.798
at the very beginning
of the movie

20:14.799 --> 20:18.470
and he reaches over to shake
Jack Nicholson's hand...

20:18.471 --> 20:21.562
and so step through
that scene frame by frame.

20:21.563 --> 20:23.555
And the minute,
the moment,

20:23.556 --> 20:27.809
the frame that he
and Jack Nicholson touch hands

20:27.810 --> 20:31.479
and right after the line
that Barry Nelson says,

20:31.480 --> 20:34.649
which is, "Nice to see you,"

20:34.650 --> 20:41.030
you can see
that there's a paper...

20:41.031 --> 20:44.701
a paper tray on the desk.

20:44.702 --> 20:48.955
And as soon as they touch hands,
the paper tray

20:48.956 --> 20:53.543
turns into a very large
straight-on hard-on

20:53.544 --> 20:55.842
coming out of Barry nelson.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.048
Yeah, it's hilarious.

20:59.049 --> 21:04.012
It's a joke... a very serious
joke... but a joke by Stanley.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.723
And there's
many of these in the film.

21:06.724 --> 21:11.144
And very disturbing,
some of them.

21:11.145 --> 21:14.192
And this will all be in my film,
Kubrick the Magician.

21:14.193 --> 21:15.487
I'll give you one more.

21:15.488 --> 21:17.692
This one's harder to find, okay?

21:17.693 --> 21:20.365
And you have to know what
Stanley Kubrick looked like

21:20.366 --> 21:23.578
during the making of
The Shining to know this one.

21:23.579 --> 21:25.827
But if you go
to the opening credits

21:25.828 --> 21:27.660
and you pan the frame...

21:27.661 --> 21:30.246
you... you go through the frames,

21:30.247 --> 21:34.167
right after it says
"Directed by Stanley Kubrick,"

21:34.168 --> 21:38.880
as soon as his name
passes off the frame,

21:38.881 --> 21:44.511
stop and you will see that the
clouds have Stanley Kubrick

21:44.512 --> 21:49.390
airbrushed into them,
his face...

21:49.391 --> 21:52.732
with the beard and the wild hair
and the whole thing.

21:52.733 --> 21:54.774
I know this one's
a little harder to find.

21:54.775 --> 21:56.067
And I will have to...

21:56.068 --> 21:59.319
I will have to Photoshop
this one to show people it,

21:59.320 --> 22:03.198
but there is definitely the
photograph of Stanley Kubrick

22:03.199 --> 22:07.998
in one frame
airbrushed into the clouds.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.041
- In most films,
a dissolve is used

22:13.042 --> 22:16.835
to indicate a long passage
of time between two scenes.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.259
But in The Shining,
the dissolves go on for so long

22:20.260 --> 22:22.634
that they create
a superimposition,

22:22.635 --> 22:27.262
where different scenes seem to
be interacting with each other.

22:27.263 --> 22:31.266
For example,
you have the exterior image...

22:31.267 --> 22:35.395
a tracking shot of the lobby

22:35.396 --> 22:39.816
of the camera
moving along the western wall

22:39.817 --> 22:42.944
south towards the entrance.

22:42.945 --> 22:49.784
And you see
a janitor mopping the floor,

22:49.785 --> 22:52.370
but it looks like he's...

22:52.371 --> 22:54.465
it looks like
a he's a giant, mopping,

22:54.466 --> 22:58.167
like, clearing the forest

22:58.168 --> 23:03.506
because he's mopping, like,
a vacant area in the forest.

23:03.507 --> 23:07.677
And then the...

23:07.678 --> 23:12.098
then the ladder lines up...

23:12.099 --> 23:16.769
lines up with the pyramid form
of the exterior of the hotel,

23:16.770 --> 23:22.150
which, in the exterior set,
disappears.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.364
Like, we don't see...

23:23.365 --> 23:26.204
we only see that
in the Timberline exteriors.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.824
But the England movie set
exteriors of the hotel,

23:29.825 --> 23:31.910
like, the pyramid is missing,

23:31.911 --> 23:37.665
and it seems as if the hotel

23:37.666 --> 23:44.464
then takes both sides
of the Timberline Hotel

23:44.465 --> 23:47.685
and then kind of, like,
makes a composite of it.

23:47.686 --> 23:50.803
So it's... you know,
it's a perceptual shift

23:50.804 --> 23:55.016
of making people
look like giants,

23:55.017 --> 24:00.939
also making the hotel look
larger or smaller than it is.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.284
I mean, these things
kind of litter the movie.

24:03.285 --> 24:06.736
But then the shot goes on.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.780
We see a...

24:08.781 --> 24:14.959
we see a janitor pushing
a folded-up bed on wheels.

24:17.414 --> 24:21.209
And then he's followed
by another...

24:21.210 --> 24:25.296
he's followed by another guy,
who's carrying, like, one...

24:25.297 --> 24:27.757
like, one coffee table?

24:27.758 --> 24:31.056
And then another... like, another
guy is carrying one chair.

24:31.057 --> 24:35.229
Like, where are these guys going
with, like, these light loads,

24:35.230 --> 24:36.224
you know?

24:38.310 --> 24:42.605
Then we see Jack sitting
on a chair, eating lunch.

24:42.606 --> 24:46.150
And the manager
and his assistant crosses paths

24:46.151 --> 24:47.819
with two women who...

24:47.820 --> 24:50.448
and just as he's
in the corner of the screen...

24:50.449 --> 24:52.243
you just see it for a second.

24:52.244 --> 24:54.412
You see one of the women
is wearing, like, a 13,

24:54.413 --> 24:55.662
a number 13 jersey?

24:58.122 --> 24:59.122
Can you hear that?

24:59.123 --> 25:01.916
My boy, yelling?

25:01.917 --> 25:02.917
Hold on one second.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.088
I'm gonna see if I can...

25:04.089 --> 25:05.929
I can see
if I can calm him down.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.762
You know,
so, like, he's like,

25:14.763 --> 25:16.764
leaning back
and eating a sandwich.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.392
And he's got, you know,
a magazine in his lap.

25:19.393 --> 25:22.520
And as he stands up
to greet them,

25:22.521 --> 25:23.943
he, like, throws it down.

25:23.944 --> 25:26.107
And if you look at"
look at...

25:26.108 --> 25:28.401
look at it, you know,
close up,

25:28.402 --> 25:32.989
it's an actual
Playgirl magazine.

25:32.990 --> 25:36.369
Yeah, a Playgirl magazine
in the lobby of a hotel

25:36.370 --> 25:39.120
right in front of his boss,
like on his first day at work.

25:41.457 --> 25:42.999
Yeah.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.800
Like, the cover is like, people
getting ready for New Year's.

25:46.801 --> 25:49.297
There's an article about incest.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.846
At the beginning of the film,
Danny's been physically abused.

25:52.847 --> 25:54.095
But there's a suggestion

25:54.096 --> 25:56.643
that he's been
sexually abused as well.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.935
You know, so like,
just in that one...

26:02.936 --> 26:09.567
one shot, there's all these,
like, you know, complex things

26:09.568 --> 26:10.863
going on in the background,

26:10.864 --> 26:13.157
like things
that are choreographed

26:13.158 --> 26:14.498
to match up exactly.

26:14.499 --> 26:16.240
Like, we see a guy...

26:16.241 --> 26:20.161
we see a guy, carrying a...

26:20.162 --> 26:25.833
entering the room,
carrying a rug.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.506
And by the time
the scene is just ending,

26:28.507 --> 26:30.598
we see him
walking up the stairs.

26:30.599 --> 26:35.051
Like, he's crossed
the entire place,

26:35.052 --> 26:36.052
you know, timed exactly.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.053
I don't even...

26:40.599 --> 26:41.600
Yeah.

26:48.524 --> 26:51.651
- When Ullman
is leading the Torrances

26:51.652 --> 26:55.738
out of the elevator
and into the Colorado Lounge

26:55.739 --> 27:01.035
for the first time,
there's a pile of suitcases.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.955
And in the dissolve
into that scene,

27:03.956 --> 27:08.417
the scene before,
a group of tourists

27:08.418 --> 27:09.757
are standing in the lobby.

27:09.758 --> 27:13.007
And those tourists
dissolve into the suitcases.

27:13.008 --> 27:15.179
Now, as an historian
of the Holocaust,

27:15.180 --> 27:17.844
I find that
very, very striking

27:17.845 --> 27:19.222
and certainly not accidental

27:19.223 --> 27:22.682
'cause he's using those
sort of cross-dissolves.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.104
Now, that could be,
along with the ladder,

27:25.105 --> 27:27.821
where he's trying to make
substantive connections

27:27.822 --> 27:29.531
as well as formal ones.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.907
- Oh, the window
in Ullman's office,

27:37.908 --> 27:39.954
it is absolutely beautiful.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.712
The casual viewer
isn't going to see

27:43.713 --> 27:46.372
so many things
in Kubrick's films,

27:46.373 --> 27:49.377
although I think they may
register unconsciously.

27:49.378 --> 27:51.297
You know, but they're not
going to, you know,

27:51.298 --> 27:52.759
perceive
perhaps these things

27:52.760 --> 27:53.926
because as I've said,

27:53.927 --> 27:56.966
he presents them
as being real.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.262
You know, it's realism.

27:58.263 --> 28:00.011
And it's not
your typical horror...

28:00.012 --> 28:01.264
you don't have a horror film

28:01.265 --> 28:03.311
except for this one section
at the end,

28:03.312 --> 28:07.643
right where Wendy walks in
and the lobby is blue

28:07.644 --> 28:09.315
and you've got the cobwebs
all around.

28:09.316 --> 28:10.483
And it's almost like

28:10.484 --> 28:12.401
a Saturday morning
kind of horror film

28:12.402 --> 28:13.946
suddenly there for a second.

28:13.947 --> 28:15.401
And you kind of go.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.743
"Ooh, what is this with
the skeletons and the cobwebs?"

28:18.744 --> 28:20.284
And it's kind of cheesy.

28:20.285 --> 28:22.829
But then, after that,
following that,

28:22.830 --> 28:25.122
you've got her going down
the red hallway,

28:25.123 --> 28:26.667
which...
on the big screen,

28:26.668 --> 28:28.289
that's petrifying.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.509
So I think the kind of
cheesiness before it

28:30.510 --> 28:32.628
helps set up
that red hallway.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.131
So anyway, what was I saying?

28:37.132 --> 28:38.304
Right, the windows.

28:38.305 --> 28:40.468
So you got... Jack has entered.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.392
And you can see...
you are...

28:42.393 --> 28:43.804
Kubrick shows you.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.900
But he shows you this lobby,
and you get to see...

28:46.901 --> 28:51.103
as Jack moves across the lobby,
you see the elevator beyond.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.150
And you see beyond that,
a hallway.

28:53.151 --> 28:56.364
You don't see yet how far back
it goes, you know,

28:56.365 --> 28:59.364
the other things back there,
but you have an impression

28:59.365 --> 29:02.829
that this place is towards
the middle of the hotel.

29:02.830 --> 29:04.997
You just have that
impression that it's towards

29:04.998 --> 29:06.661
the middle of the hotel.

29:06.662 --> 29:10.212
And you go from the lobby into
the general manager's office

29:10.213 --> 29:15.419
and then into Ullman's office,
and there's this window.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.341
And the window's
a powerful window.

29:17.342 --> 29:19.717
I mean, the light coming
through there is glaring.

29:19.718 --> 29:22.093
It's like a character in itself.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.220
It takes over.

29:24.221 --> 29:27.687
And you've got these tendril-y,
sinister kind of trees

29:27.688 --> 29:29.060
that are outside the window.

29:29.061 --> 29:30.685
And you've got...

29:30.686 --> 29:32.357
it's just such
a forceful presence,

29:32.358 --> 29:34.072
this light
that comes over everything.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.065
And, you know...

29:36.066 --> 29:39.026
And there's
something wrong with it.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.199
There's something wrong with it,

29:40.200 --> 29:42.822
and I think it registers
as something wrong.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.496
This is an impossible window.

29:44.497 --> 29:46.784
It's not... it is impossible.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.205
It is physically impossible.

29:48.206 --> 29:49.203
It cannot be there.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.705
It should not be there.

29:50.706 --> 29:54.709
There's no place in the hotel
for this window to exist.

29:54.710 --> 29:55.710
It's only toward...

29:55.711 --> 29:57.179
finally,
towards the end of the film,

29:57.180 --> 30:00.548
that you have the realization
that there are several hallways

30:00.549 --> 30:04.218
in succession behind the office.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.971
You see it when Wendy,

30:06.972 --> 30:10.146
when she's later down there and
she sees Dick Hallorann's body

30:10.147 --> 30:11.934
after he's been killed.

30:11.935 --> 30:16.190
You have her behind... in that
hallway behind the office.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.323
So really, now, what
can I tell you about the maps?

30:22.324 --> 30:24.322
No, I did not sit down
with graph paper.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.076
I did not even begin to attempt
to do them to scale.

30:27.077 --> 30:28.284
Let me see.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.128
I can't say which room
I started off with.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.871
I don't remember.

30:31.872 --> 30:34.250
I just went through
and decided I was going to do...

30:34.251 --> 30:37.253
try to do as much as I could,
feeling that...

30:37.254 --> 30:39.048
I felt, eventually,
that there were places

30:39.049 --> 30:43.094
that I could plot out, such
as where the girls were killed.

30:43.095 --> 30:44.967
I was not absolutely sure
at that point,

30:44.968 --> 30:46.432
when I started out
doing the maps,

30:46.433 --> 30:47.680
where the girls were killed.

30:47.681 --> 30:50.148
But I felt that it was
somewhere back around

30:50.149 --> 30:53.726
the area where they lived.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.269
Suite number, what?

30:55.270 --> 30:57.068
They lived at
suite number 3.

31:00.692 --> 31:04.570
- When Jack is sitting,
typing at his typewriter,

31:04.571 --> 31:07.120
and Wendy comes in
and interrupts him

31:07.121 --> 31:08.616
while he's working...

31:08.617 --> 31:10.206
and in one shot of Jack...

31:10.207 --> 31:11.541
- You get a lot written today?

31:11.542 --> 31:14.288
- Sitting at the typewriter,
a one shot,

31:14.289 --> 31:15.414
you look back behind him.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.133
And of course,
you can see very clearly

31:17.134 --> 31:20.669
'cause Kubrick was the master
of depth of field.

31:20.670 --> 31:23.923
He kept everything in focus
so he would have lots of space

31:23.924 --> 31:27.144
in which to puts things
that he wanted you to notice.

31:27.145 --> 31:31.389
And in the first shot, behind
Jack sitting at his typewriter,

31:31.390 --> 31:35.440
back against a wall, behind him
probably 10 or 12 or 15 feet

31:35.441 --> 31:36.482
is a chair.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.862
And then there's a switch
to a one-shot of Wendy

31:40.863 --> 31:42.066
saying something.

31:42.067 --> 31:45.697
- Hey, the weather forecast
said it's gonna snow tonight.

31:45.698 --> 31:48.948
- And then the camera
switches back to Jack,

31:48.949 --> 31:51.158
and the chair is gone.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.832
- What do you want me
to do about it?

31:55.330 --> 31:58.504
- And my students and I
always have fun with that,

31:58.505 --> 32:01.335
saying,
"Well, continuity error?"

32:01.336 --> 32:02.837
Could be.

32:02.838 --> 32:06.632
Or it's not,
and the answer, if it's not...

32:06.633 --> 32:08.509
or if it was originally

32:08.510 --> 32:10.979
and then Kubrick saw it
and decided to keep it,

32:10.980 --> 32:15.224
is that he's
parodying honor films

32:15.225 --> 32:21.272
in order to remind you that
this isn't just a horror film.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.571
And there's another one
in The Shining that's, I think,

32:23.572 --> 32:25.192
less well-noticed.

32:25.193 --> 32:30.197
And I think it's even more
clearly substantive.

32:30.198 --> 32:35.744
When Danny has his first vision
of the elevator gushing blood

32:35.745 --> 32:39.039
and the camera
is tracking toward him,

32:39.040 --> 32:42.126
past the open door
of his bedroom

32:42.127 --> 32:44.674
and toward the hall
and the bathroom,

32:44.675 --> 32:46.969
the open bathroom door
across the hall...

32:46.970 --> 32:51.385
and his bedroom door, as you
would expect a kid's door,

32:51.386 --> 32:54.305
has lots
of cartoon characters on it

32:54.306 --> 32:57.475
And, the one
who is most apparent,

32:57.476 --> 32:59.315
because it's right
at the edge of the door

32:59.316 --> 33:01.530
and it's the largest one
that you can see

33:01.531 --> 33:05.900
and it's the last one you can
see as the camera moves past it,

33:05.901 --> 33:08.068
is one of the Seven Dwarves.

33:08.069 --> 33:11.414
And it happens to be Dopey,
okay?

33:13.074 --> 33:16.410
Subsequently,
after Danny has passed out,

33:16.411 --> 33:19.415
Wendy and the pediatrician
leave Danny's room.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.754
And as they do, they,
of course, go out his door.

33:21.755 --> 33:23.339
And you again see the door,

33:23.340 --> 33:26.259
the open door with all
the cartoon characters on it,

33:26.260 --> 33:29.006
and Dopey isn't there.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.926
Now, again continuity error?

33:31.927 --> 33:33.427
I don't think so.

33:33.428 --> 33:36.147
I think what Kubrick
is saying is that before,

33:36.148 --> 33:41.101
Danny had no idea about
the world, and now he knows.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.067
He is no longer a dope
about things.

33:43.068 --> 33:44.565
He has been enlightened.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.778
- Anything you say, Lloyd.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.247
Anything you say.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.295
- The the advocaat is spilled.

34:08.295 --> 34:09.295
There's the accident.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.467
Kubrick is setting it up

34:10.467 --> 34:12.761
as where they come around
in a circle,

34:12.762 --> 34:14.974
'cause I feel like
that's what the camera does.

34:14.975 --> 34:17.813
I feel like the camera
brings us around in a circle

34:17.815 --> 34:19.723
so that we're coming back.

34:19.724 --> 34:24.853
The bathroom seems to be
overlaying the Gold Room and...

34:24.853 --> 34:27.231
so that
the advocaat situation

34:27.232 --> 34:28.859
in the bathroom
is occurring about

34:28.860 --> 34:31.202
in the same area
that it did in the Gold Room.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.536
- They use the camera

34:38.536 --> 34:42.621
to create an emotional
architecture in your mind

34:42.621 --> 34:45.295
but at the same time,
showing you that it's false.

34:45.297 --> 34:48.918
The set is complete...
so completely plastic

34:48.920 --> 34:51.844
that its contradictions pile up
in your subconscious.

34:55.302 --> 34:58.470
Hallorann is showing...

34:58.471 --> 35:02.141
showing Wendy, you know,
the place where she will,

35:02.142 --> 35:08.314
you know, basically,
entrap Jack...

35:08.315 --> 35:10.691
entrap him both physically,

35:10.692 --> 35:16.822
but also, like, that will be
the last straw for him,

35:16.823 --> 35:20.868
last straw for
the management of the hotel.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.870
It's in the store room
that he finally is like,

35:22.871 --> 35:27.207
"Okay.
Now I'm gonna do it."

35:27.208 --> 35:29.631
And, you know,
the opening of that door

35:29.632 --> 35:35.215
is the famous, like,
only thing that's supernatural

35:35.216 --> 35:38.220
happens in the movie that can't
be explained any other way.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.220
Yeah.

35:41.931 --> 35:45.147
But except that it can be
explained another way,

35:45.148 --> 35:46.895
in that Danny lets him out.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.033
I do have this idea that Danny

35:56.034 --> 35:58.452
is a lot more consciously
murdering his father

35:58.453 --> 36:00.416
than the narrative lets on.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.085
I don't know.
It's weird.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.259
Like, you notice how, like,
Wendy's walking backwards

36:13.260 --> 36:17.591
when she's having
that confrontation with Jack

36:17.592 --> 36:20.761
in the lounge, you know.

36:20.762 --> 36:27.768
And she's being drawn up
to the hexagonal hallway room.

36:27.769 --> 36:31.563
And you see Danny shining
at the beginning of that.

36:31.564 --> 36:34.108
He's in his room,
and there's, like,

36:34.109 --> 36:36.658
lights flickering in his eyes.

36:38.071 --> 36:40.119
Like, is Danny drawing...
you know,

36:40.120 --> 36:44.618
drawing his mother up the stairs
so that she can, you know,

36:44.619 --> 36:49.216
sacrifice Jack on top of that,
you know, weird pyramid?

36:58.675 --> 37:00.222
- When I had a chance...
when I was doing a story

37:00.223 --> 37:02.016
out in Denver,
we went up to Estes Park.

37:02.017 --> 37:03.804
It was in the off-season.

37:03.805 --> 37:06.684
Went into the Stanley Hotel,
and I asked to see the manager.

37:06.685 --> 37:09.023
And he came out, and we were
just having lunch with him.

37:09.024 --> 37:11.520
And I said, "Can we talk to you?
I write about The Shining."

37:11.521 --> 37:12.738
He said, "Really?"

37:12.739 --> 37:14.481
This fellow told me

37:14.482 --> 37:19.278
that he got a phone call
from Stanley Kubrick, who said,

37:19.279 --> 37:21.623
"I think I want to make
a movie about The Shining."

37:21.624 --> 37:25.075
And then he would keep
this fellow on the phone

37:25.076 --> 37:26.785
for a long time.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.207
He said, "We had many
long, long conversations

37:29.208 --> 37:31.752
in which he picked my brain
about everything."

37:31.753 --> 37:32.958
And at that point, he said,

37:32.959 --> 37:34.757
"Kubrick was talking about
maybe coming here

37:34.758 --> 37:38.344
to make the movie here,"
which I expect, at that point,

37:38.345 --> 37:40.090
that fellow liked the idea of,

37:40.091 --> 37:41.592
so it would
make his hotel famous.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.267
And Kubrick said, "I'd like
to send out a research team."

37:44.268 --> 37:46.263
And so he then sent out...

37:46.264 --> 37:48.358
the man said it was something
like two or three people

37:48.359 --> 37:49.850
who came out here
and stayed here

37:49.851 --> 37:54.271
for two or three months,
taking photographs everywhere.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.195
And they spent a lot of time
also down in Denver

37:56.196 --> 37:58.068
in the Colorado state archives,

37:58.069 --> 38:00.611
finding out,
as I would now expect,

38:00.612 --> 38:04.406
the full history of Colorado,

38:04.407 --> 38:06.000
which... the flag of which
plays a part.

38:06.001 --> 38:09.995
And the gold rush,
the Colorado Gold Rush

38:09.996 --> 38:11.413
was also a very big event.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.836
And there's all...
there's still a lot

38:12.837 --> 38:15.756
of American Indian/white people
tension in Colorado

38:15.757 --> 38:19.046
with Navajos and Arapahos
just to the south.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.137
This research team found out
absolutely everything

38:21.138 --> 38:23.385
about Colorado,
about Estes Park,

38:23.386 --> 38:25.886
about the Stanley Hotel,
about its entire history,

38:25.887 --> 38:28.472
took photographs
all over the place.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.394
Three months was
the impression that I have

38:30.395 --> 38:32.985
of what he said about
how this research team

38:32.986 --> 38:35.562
gathered absolutely everything.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.908
Kubrick unearthed an enormous
amount about the real history

38:38.909 --> 38:41.443
of Colorado,
where this takes place,

38:41.444 --> 38:45.823
because what he has done
is found a way to dig

38:45.824 --> 38:48.577
into all of the patterns
of our civilization,

38:48.578 --> 38:50.911
our times
and our cultures,

38:50.912 --> 38:53.415
and the things that
we don't want to look at.

38:53.416 --> 38:56.750
And this movie is very much
also about denial

38:56.751 --> 38:58.547
of the genocides
that we committed...

38:58.548 --> 39:00.297
we white folk from Europe...

39:00.298 --> 39:03.131
committed here and not that...

39:03.132 --> 39:05.351
not that white folks are the
only people who do genocide.

39:05.352 --> 39:08.265
All humans do, as Kubrick
makes clear in this movie.

39:08.266 --> 39:11.229
He would research everything
and the full history and nature

39:11.230 --> 39:14.444
of everything you're gonna see
in the movie on the screen

39:14.445 --> 39:19.273
and then
boil it down and boil it down

39:19.274 --> 39:21.368
until he got the universal
human and global patterns

39:21.369 --> 39:24.361
that make it so real.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.698
- White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.451
White man's burden.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.833
I like you, Lloyd.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.710
I always liked you.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.296
You were always the best of 'em.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.756
The best goddamned bartender

39:44.757 --> 39:48.135
from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine,

39:48.136 --> 39:50.639
or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.352
- Thank you for saying so.

39:52.353 --> 39:53.599
- What does it mean?

39:53.600 --> 39:55.022
Jack saying, "You always
were the best of 'em."

39:55.023 --> 39:56.270
Starting in Timbuktu?

39:56.271 --> 39:58.270
Jack the schoolteacher
was never in Timbuktu,

39:58.271 --> 40:00.731
but Jack
the universal weak male

40:00.732 --> 40:02.985
hired by armies
to go commit atrocities

40:02.986 --> 40:04.611
has always been there.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.079
Now, of course,
the word "Portland"

40:07.080 --> 40:08.914
is neat because
it means where we landed

40:08.915 --> 40:12.200
or where the British
or the Europeans landed.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.791
And Portland, Maine... Oregon is
where they may have taken off

40:14.792 --> 40:16.084
from to go further west.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.250
Kubrick is thinking about
the implications

40:20.251 --> 40:22.253
of everything that exists.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.006
You know, the power of the genie
is in its confinement,

40:26.007 --> 40:28.886
as the great American poet
Richard Wilbur said.

40:28.887 --> 40:31.929
Boiling it down, you know,
10,000 years in a little lamp,

40:31.930 --> 40:33.225
you got to get
your act together.

40:33.226 --> 40:34.394
But that's the essence
of great art.

40:34.395 --> 40:35.766
It's like a dream.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.188
It's boiled everything down
to an emblematic symbol

40:38.189 --> 40:40.029
that's got all of life in it.

40:42.357 --> 40:44.530
Now, if you'll allow me to make
a little bit of a link here.

40:44.531 --> 40:46.446
As I've thinking of this more
in recent years,

40:46.447 --> 40:50.369
what we now understand to be
the nature of what dreams are,

40:50.370 --> 40:55.035
I mean, it seems to be,
the general theory is,

40:55.036 --> 40:57.414
that it's a way
for the brain to boil down

40:57.415 --> 40:59.039
all of the
previous experiences

40:59.040 --> 41:01.461
and then add in
that day's experiences

41:01.462 --> 41:04.429
as well to see what kind
of overall universal patterns

41:04.430 --> 41:06.546
there are to be found,

41:06.547 --> 41:09.344
so that you can be aware of what
the patterns are out there,

41:09.345 --> 41:11.720
so that your subconscious
will be all the more ready

41:11.721 --> 41:14.221
to react suddenly when you see
something dangerous happen

41:14.222 --> 41:16.850
or something important
happen that may lead you

41:16.851 --> 41:20.978
to a mate or to some food
or away from danger.

41:20.979 --> 41:27.567
And therefore, the way Kubrick
made movies was not unlike

41:27.568 --> 41:30.447
the way, according
to these current theories,

41:30.448 --> 41:35.158
our brains create memories
and, for that matter, dreams.

41:35.159 --> 41:39.329
That's the ultimate shining
that Kubrick does.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.331
He is like a mega brain
for the planet

41:41.332 --> 41:44.677
who is boiling down with
all of this extensive research,

41:44.678 --> 41:47.587
all of these
patterns of our world

41:47.588 --> 41:50.010
and then giving them back to us
in a dream of a movie...

41:50.011 --> 41:51.760
because movies
are like a dream...

41:51.761 --> 41:54.052
and that's related
to why I think

41:54.053 --> 41:55.771
there's a lot of evidence
that what Kubrick

41:55.772 --> 42:01.018
also gave us in The Shining
is a movie about the past.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.436
Not just any past.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.146
The past.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.440
I mean past-ness.

42:06.441 --> 42:11.278
It's a movie
about how the past impinges.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.280
That's what ghosts are.

42:13.281 --> 42:16.125
That's what those skitter-y
voices in the opening shot

42:16.126 --> 42:18.618
that are following are about.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.836
There's two phrases from T.S.
Eliot that I often think of

42:20.837 --> 42:21.955
when I'm thinking about
The Shining.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.540
One of them is "The night"...

42:23.541 --> 42:24.793
I think they're both
from T.S. Eliot...

42:24.794 --> 42:26.043
"The nightmare of history...

42:26.044 --> 42:28.797
how can we awake from
the nightmare of history?"

42:30.882 --> 42:34.136
- And the other is his phrase...
T.S. Eliot's phrase...

42:34.137 --> 42:37.014
"History has
many cunning passages."

42:38.473 --> 42:42.559
And I think both of those
phrases are directly apt

42:42.560 --> 42:44.399
for The Shining,
in which we see

42:44.400 --> 42:47.486
many cunning passages in the
maze and in the hotel itself

42:47.487 --> 42:50.235
and in which the past
becomes a nightmare,

42:50.236 --> 42:53.075
and in which Kubrick
shows us how you escape

42:53.076 --> 42:56.615
from the nightmare of the past
by retracing your steps,

42:56.616 --> 42:57.831
as Danny does
in that last line,

42:57.832 --> 42:59.326
which means
acknowledging what happened

42:59.327 --> 43:03.038
and learning about the past
and then getting out,

43:03.039 --> 43:05.754
only if you are
going to be able to shine

43:05.755 --> 43:06.958
and see what the patterns are

43:06.959 --> 43:08.176
so you know
to get away from them

43:08.177 --> 43:10.968
and avoid them
and go for the good things.

43:10.969 --> 43:15.592
I mean, The Shining is his movie
about how families break down,

43:15.593 --> 43:17.015
whether they are
an individual family

43:17.016 --> 43:20.222
or the larger societal family

43:20.223 --> 43:22.432
that tries to break up
individual families.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.434
And his hat movie,
Eyes Wide Shut is the opposite.

43:24.435 --> 43:28.355
It's about
a family sorely tried,

43:28.356 --> 43:30.527
Bill Hartford
and his wife and child,

43:30.528 --> 43:32.526
that survives
all the horrible temptations

43:32.527 --> 43:34.154
that are in our DNA.

43:43.538 --> 43:45.956
- This is our famous hedge maze.

43:45.957 --> 43:47.499
It's a lot of fun.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.797
But I wouldn't
want to go in there

43:48.798 --> 43:51.012
unless I had an hour to spare
to find my way out.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.759
- I did not look at it again
for a number of years

43:54.760 --> 43:56.555
until it came out in rental.

43:56.556 --> 43:59.511
And then I picked it up
a couple of times.

43:59.512 --> 44:02.472
And, what, you had three days
in order to watch a rental?

44:02.473 --> 44:03.690
And so, I can remember watching

44:03.691 --> 44:05.898
it over and over again
during those three days

44:05.899 --> 44:07.769
and really taking
a good look at it then.

44:07.770 --> 44:11.068
And I was able to think "Oh,
yes, this is what I remember.

44:11.069 --> 44:12.404
This is what I thought I saw,"

44:12.405 --> 44:13.652
and then catching more things.

44:13.653 --> 44:15.904
But it wasn't, of course,
until DVD came out

44:15.905 --> 44:17.742
that I was really able
to sit down

44:17.743 --> 44:21.584
and take a good look at it as
far as just running through it

44:21.585 --> 44:25.537
over and over and over again.

44:25.538 --> 44:29.875
Kubrick presents these things
where it's, you know, real...

44:29.876 --> 44:31.418
you know, it's realistic.

44:31.419 --> 44:33.467
You're not supposed to see
what's actually going on.

44:33.468 --> 44:34.588
You've got Danny.

44:34.589 --> 44:36.216
He's in the game room.
He turns around.

44:36.217 --> 44:39.469
We're supposed to be focused
on the two girls there.

44:39.470 --> 44:41.514
And than you... I saw...
over on the left,

44:41.515 --> 44:42.807
I see this skiing poster.

44:42.808 --> 44:45.226
And the thing is that
you already have Jack.

44:45.227 --> 44:47.100
He's already asked about skiing.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.819
But why isn't... you know,
"What about skiing?

44:48.820 --> 44:50.857
Isn't the skiing good here
in the hotel?"

44:50.858 --> 44:53.695
And he's already given the story
of why it isn't good,

44:53.696 --> 44:55.025
why they can't do that.

44:55.026 --> 44:56.026
But you got the skiing poster.

44:56.027 --> 44:57.199
And my eye is drawn to it.

44:57.200 --> 44:59.946
And I realize
that's not a skier.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.415
That's a... that's a minotaur.

45:01.416 --> 45:03.200
It just leaped out at me.

45:03.201 --> 45:04.201
And so that was something

45:04.202 --> 45:06.417
that I was able
to look at later on VHS

45:06.418 --> 45:09.378
and say, "Yes, I had actually
seen a minotaur there,"

45:09.379 --> 45:12.125
where the upper body, you've got
this really, you know,

45:12.126 --> 45:14.753
overblown physique,
very physical physique.

45:14.754 --> 45:16.301
And then you've got
the suggestion...

45:16.302 --> 45:19.507
you have a suggestion
of a skiing pole there,

45:19.508 --> 45:21.223
but it's not really there.

45:21.224 --> 45:22.687
It's just
a suggestion of one.

45:22.688 --> 45:25.013
And the lower body
is positioned,

45:25.014 --> 45:26.391
the way the legs are,

45:26.392 --> 45:27.974
it's like a minotaur,
the build is.

45:27.975 --> 45:29.522
And you've actually got
the tail there.

45:29.523 --> 45:31.353
And so it is a minotaur.

45:31.354 --> 45:34.733
And this is in...
on the opposite side of the door

45:34.734 --> 45:38.318
you have a cowboy
on a bucking bronco, so...

45:38.319 --> 45:40.367
and so you got
a kind of echo there,

45:40.368 --> 45:41.738
where you got the

45:41.739 --> 45:43.829
minotaur on one side,
the bull man,

45:43.830 --> 45:46.418
and on the other side,
you got the cowboy,

45:46.419 --> 45:48.828
the man on the bucking bronco.

45:48.829 --> 45:51.957
And this is just following
the scene where they...

45:51.958 --> 45:54.834
Ullman has been
taking Jack and Wendy

45:54.835 --> 45:56.211
through the Colorado Lounge,

45:56.212 --> 45:58.055
showing off the Colorado Lounge.

45:58.056 --> 45:59.839
And they go
into the hall

45:59.840 --> 46:01.638
behind the Colorado Lounge.

46:01.639 --> 46:04.219
And what's there,
but on the wall,

46:04.220 --> 46:06.848
there is a painting
of an American Indian

46:06.849 --> 46:09.349
with a buffalo headdress on.

46:09.350 --> 46:12.022
And at that point,
Ullman is discussing with Wendy

46:12.023 --> 46:14.020
who has stayed there
at the hotel.

46:14.021 --> 46:17.241
Royalty, the best people,
stars have stayed there.

46:17.242 --> 46:19.317
- Royalty?

46:19.318 --> 46:21.070
- All the best people.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.706
- You have "monarch" on
the bottom, which, you know,

46:27.707 --> 46:29.619
keys in with royalty.

46:29.620 --> 46:32.372
And you also have this
whole idea of the stars.

46:32.373 --> 46:36.293
And the minotaur's name is,
what, Asterius?

46:36.294 --> 46:39.337
His name is Asterius,
which means "starry."

46:39.338 --> 46:41.052
So you know, you got
several things there

46:41.053 --> 46:42.924
to do with mythology
that fit in.

46:42.925 --> 46:44.175
It's very exciting to me.

46:44.176 --> 46:45.427
That was the... you know,
that's the kind of

46:45.428 --> 46:46.645
leap-up-end-down moment
where you go,

46:46.646 --> 46:49.848
"Oh, wow, look at what
Kubrick has there."

46:49.849 --> 46:52.646
Yeah, I mean the minotaur lives
at the heart of the labyrinth.

46:52.647 --> 46:53.810
He's a part of the labyrinth.

46:53.811 --> 46:54.981
The labyrinth,
at least in the myth...

46:54.982 --> 46:56.196
you know,
in this particular myth...

46:56.197 --> 46:58.565
was built for the minotaur.

46:58.566 --> 47:00.989
The hotel is... you know,
it is the labyrinth.

47:00.990 --> 47:03.403
And Jack is the minotaur.

47:03.404 --> 47:06.656
You have scenes with him
where he...

47:06.657 --> 47:08.616
such as in...
what is it?

47:08.617 --> 47:10.035
The Thursday scene.

47:10.036 --> 47:11.911
The snowfall has started.

47:11.912 --> 47:15.457
You have Wendy and Danny
outside playing.

47:15.458 --> 47:17.254
And Jack
is inside the Colorado Lounge,

47:17.255 --> 47:18.715
and he's looking out at them.

47:18.716 --> 47:22.052
His head is tilted down,
and his eyes are somewhat...

47:22.053 --> 47:23.425
his eyes are elevated.

47:23.426 --> 47:24.424
They're pointing up.

47:24.425 --> 47:26.176
And his eyebrows are drawn up.

47:26.177 --> 47:28.053
But he has this
expression on his face

47:28.054 --> 47:30.682
that he gets progressively
throughout the film

47:30.683 --> 47:32.145
that is very bull-like.

47:32.146 --> 47:34.434
It has a very
minotaur-like expression.

47:34.435 --> 47:36.233
It's the same kind
of expression that Kubrick

47:36.234 --> 47:37.442
pulls out in other films,

47:37.443 --> 47:39.439
such as it was on
Private Pyle's face

47:39.440 --> 47:42.108
in the berserker scene
in the bathroom

47:42.109 --> 47:43.818
in Full Metal Jacket.

47:43.819 --> 47:46.446
So it's, you know,
not specific to this film.

47:46.447 --> 47:49.917
There's more minotaur imagery
and labyrinth imagery.

47:49.918 --> 47:52.410
There's the Gold Room.

47:52.411 --> 47:53.411
In front of the Gold Room,

47:53.412 --> 47:56.289
you have
the "Unwinding Hours" sign.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.133
And that plays in
with the labyrinth,

47:58.134 --> 47:59.793
where you have...

47:59.794 --> 48:01.508
Theseus
enters into the labyrinth,

48:01.509 --> 48:02.756
and he has
the thread with him

48:02.757 --> 48:04.970
that he ties
at the beginning that,

48:04.971 --> 48:07.305
you know, assists him
in going through the labyrinth,

48:07.306 --> 48:09.015
where he can
find his way back out.

48:09.016 --> 48:11.685
And so I see
the "Unwinding Hours" sign

48:11.686 --> 48:14.474
as having to do
with that thread.

48:14.475 --> 48:17.147
For a while there,
I was into baseball.

48:17.148 --> 48:19.771
And I get very excited with
baseball when I'm into baseball.

48:19.772 --> 48:20.897
You know, I can be by myself,

48:20.898 --> 48:22.649
and I will be
leaping up and down.

48:22.650 --> 48:24.489
And Kubrick
is like that for me,

48:24.490 --> 48:28.158
where all I have to do is see
the minotaur poster there,

48:28.159 --> 48:31.034
and I go, "Oh, my goodness.
Look at this!"

48:31.035 --> 48:34.458
Because you're not
supposed to see the minotaur.

48:38.541 --> 48:40.669
- Danny is shown
riding his big wheel

48:40.670 --> 48:43.545
through the hotel three times.

48:43.546 --> 48:48.341
The first ride, I think,
is about realism.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.051
That's Danny is a...

48:50.052 --> 48:56.057
Danny is doing a loop
around the lounge set.

48:56.058 --> 48:58.393
You know, he goes through
the service hallway

48:58.394 --> 48:59.816
and then he goes
through the lounge

48:59.817 --> 49:02.531
and then he goes back
into the service hallway.

49:02.532 --> 49:05.650
And, you know,
when you first see the movie,

49:05.651 --> 49:07.745
you're like,
"He's just wandering around.

49:07.746 --> 49:09.487
It's crazy, it's just"...

49:09.488 --> 49:10.705
But it... no, it's very...

49:10.706 --> 49:13.032
it's just a very simple loop.

49:13.033 --> 49:14.826
He does it once.

49:14.827 --> 49:18.580
But that gives you
an idea of where...

49:18.581 --> 49:20.748
of what that place is.

49:20.749 --> 49:22.296
I mean, you know,
all right, you understand

49:22.297 --> 49:24.794
that that set is real.

49:24.795 --> 49:26.966
You know, like,
it's a continuous shot.

49:26.967 --> 49:28.261
There are no tricks.

49:28.262 --> 49:32.927
In the second ride,
in the hexagonal hallway,

49:32.928 --> 49:33.928
there are a lot of...

49:33.929 --> 49:35.397
there are more tricks.

49:35.398 --> 49:37.348
Like, he doesn't do a loop.

49:37.349 --> 49:42.061
He does kind of like
a key-shaped...

49:42.062 --> 49:48.067
you know, or a p-shaped loop
around this hallway.

49:48.068 --> 49:54.371
And you see the realism of the
connection to the lounge set.

50:05.669 --> 50:09.970
And... but you also see the fakery
of the fake elevators.

50:11.717 --> 50:13.218
And you see...
for just one second,

50:13.219 --> 50:16.940
you see the big stained glass
windows out of the corner,

50:16.941 --> 50:19.933
in the corner of the frame

50:19.934 --> 50:24.187
right before he takes a turn
around the elevator.

50:24.188 --> 50:26.282
Like, that's incredible because,

50:26.283 --> 50:30.443
like, that connects
that whole hallway

50:30.444 --> 50:34.614
to the giant
Colorado Lounge set.

50:34.615 --> 50:35.958
I mean,
that's just for one second.

50:35.959 --> 50:37.873
They didn't have to do that,
you know?

50:41.872 --> 50:43.836
But it's also... you know,
it's a metaphor

50:43.837 --> 50:45.628
because he's also elevated.

50:45.629 --> 50:48.470
He's one level up
from where he was before.

50:48.471 --> 50:53.550
Like, he starts in the same
place, just one floor up,

50:53.551 --> 50:56.266
you know, in the northeast
corner of the set.

50:56.267 --> 50:59.812
So now he's in the northeast
corner and one level up.

50:59.813 --> 51:02.809
And if you take it
as a metaphor of, like,

51:02.810 --> 51:08.731
going from a mundane reality
to up into your head

51:08.732 --> 51:11.192
to more
of a fantastical reality...

51:11.193 --> 51:14.904
The third one is even stranger,

51:14.905 --> 51:17.033
'cause he starts off
in the service unit.

51:17.034 --> 51:18.283
He starts off in the same,

51:18.284 --> 51:21.452
you know, northeast corner
of the lobby hall,

51:21.453 --> 51:24.122
of the lobby service hallway.

51:24.123 --> 51:28.835
And then he takes a turn,
and suddenly he's upstairs

51:28.836 --> 51:34.468
in the area
outside their apartment

51:36.051 --> 51:38.641
So, like,
it's a kind of a combination

51:38.642 --> 51:41.139
of the first two,
where like he's down low

51:41.140 --> 51:43.808
and then he's up high.

51:43.809 --> 51:45.310
And then he takes a turn,
and he's suddenly...

51:45.311 --> 51:49.897
he's in that that yellow,
yellow and blue wallpaper.

51:49.898 --> 51:53.067
Let's say that's
in the service hallway area.

51:53.068 --> 51:55.537
He's, you know, right outside
his parents' bedroom,

51:55.538 --> 51:59.532
so there's this
connection between him

51:59.533 --> 52:03.036
going on these big wheel rides
and dreaming.

52:03.037 --> 52:05.288
Like, he's near his bedroom.

52:05.289 --> 52:09.044
He's near... like, you see his
parents are working downstairs,

52:09.045 --> 52:11.628
but he's upstairs.

52:11.629 --> 52:15.715
You know, like, you see his mom
on the telephone,

52:15.716 --> 52:18.676
and then he's flying.

52:18.677 --> 52:22.472
He goes above her
to the bedroom,

52:22.473 --> 52:24.271
which is above
where she's working,

52:24.272 --> 52:27.685
just as
the hexagonal hallway

52:27.686 --> 52:30.772
is above
where his dad is working.

52:30.773 --> 52:34.243
So these big wheel rides
become like a visionary way

52:34.244 --> 52:38.321
of Danny to explore
his parents' headspace.

52:41.408 --> 52:44.869
You know, like,
room 237 is his, like...

52:44.870 --> 52:47.914
that's his father's
fantasy chamber

52:47.915 --> 52:51.042
where, like, he gets it on
with the witches.

52:55.506 --> 53:01.844
And the twins are like
his mother's fantasy...

53:01.845 --> 53:07.475
fantasy headspace where, like,
they're these double blue women

53:07.476 --> 53:10.525
who want to play with Danny
forever and ever.

53:10.526 --> 53:13.481
- We're all gonna have
a real good time.

53:21.407 --> 53:23.080
- My interpretation
of The Shining

53:23.081 --> 53:26.994
is that there's many levels
to this film.

53:26.995 --> 53:29.122
This is like
three-dimensional chess.

53:29.123 --> 53:35.002
And he's trying
to tell us several stories

53:35.003 --> 53:39.799
that appear to be separate
but actually are not.

53:39.800 --> 53:45.221
And he's doing this both through
the overt script that he wrote.

53:45.222 --> 53:48.975
He's telling it through tricks
of the trade,

53:48.976 --> 53:52.276
the subliminal imagery
and these constant retakes,

53:52.277 --> 53:55.356
giving him odd angles
and things.

53:55.357 --> 53:58.484
And he's also telling you

53:58.485 --> 54:04.157
through the changes that he made
to the Stephen King novel.

54:04.158 --> 54:06.035
So if you watch
those three things,

54:06.036 --> 54:09.495
you begin to understand
this deeper story.

54:09.496 --> 54:14.333
And this deeper story
has its birth, I guess,

54:14.334 --> 54:18.171
in the idea
that Stanley Kubrick

54:18.172 --> 54:22.049
was involved with faking
the Apollo moon landings.

54:22.050 --> 54:24.766
In fact, I contend that
2001: A Space Odyssey,

54:24.767 --> 54:27.978
in part, was a research
and development project

54:27.979 --> 54:30.520
for the Apollo footage
that was shot.

54:30.521 --> 54:32.645
I'm not saying
we didn't go to the moon.

54:32.646 --> 54:34.896
I'm just saying
that what we saw was faked

54:34.897 --> 54:37.694
and that it was faked
by Stanley Kubrick.

54:37.695 --> 54:40.238
And I've had Hollywood
special effects people

54:40.239 --> 54:44.158
from the '60s and '70s who were
front-screen projection experts

54:44.159 --> 54:47.956
tell me that I absolutely
have nailed the Apollo footage

54:47.957 --> 54:51.871
as being the result of
front-screen projection.

54:51.872 --> 54:54.375
Just go to any Apollo site
and look,

54:54.376 --> 54:59.045
and you'll see that they have to
hide the bottom of the screen.

54:59.046 --> 55:03.174
And you can always see
the set/screen separation line

55:03.175 --> 55:07.136
in every Apollo footage,
every Apollo image,

55:07.137 --> 55:11.140
and the video footage
that has a background.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.976
And Richard Hoagland,
the researcher,

55:13.977 --> 55:15.945
has looked
into the Apollo imagery.

55:15.946 --> 55:19.315
And he has found
all sorts of problems with it

55:19.316 --> 55:21.569
because in the sky
around the astronauts,

55:21.570 --> 55:26.906
he's found reflecting lights
and refracting things and...

55:26.907 --> 55:29.951
kind of a junk
and geometry of things

55:29.952 --> 55:31.077
that are in the sky.

55:31.078 --> 55:33.871
And he concluded, wrongly,

55:33.872 --> 55:38.251
that there are gigantic
alien cities made out of glass.

55:38.252 --> 55:42.421
What he's really seeing
is the reflections of light

55:42.422 --> 55:46.634
of the tiny beads
on the scotch light screen

55:46.635 --> 55:50.185
which is being used in the
front-screen projection process.

55:50.186 --> 55:54.809
And so, once I nailed the
front-screen projection process

55:54.810 --> 55:57.854
inside the Apollo footage,

55:57.855 --> 56:02.567
then I became interested in
seeing if Kubrick left any clues

56:02.568 --> 56:06.198
in the rest of his career
to his possible involvement

56:06.199 --> 56:08.865
in faking
the Apollo moon footage.

56:08.866 --> 56:14.370
And I was overjoyed
about two years ago

56:14.371 --> 56:18.499
when I received my
Blu-Ray copy of The Shining.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.840
And I put it
in my Blu-Ray machine

56:20.841 --> 56:23.214
and sat down one night
to watch it.

56:23.215 --> 56:29.218
And I realized that all of the
things that one could imagine

56:29.219 --> 56:31.893
that Stanley Kubrick
would have had to go through

56:31.894 --> 56:35.266
to fake
the Apollo moon footage...

56:35.267 --> 56:36.735
and there in the movie,

56:36.736 --> 56:41.105
every time that Stanley deviated
from the Stephen King novel,

56:41.106 --> 56:44.525
he deviated
into those exact questions.

56:44.526 --> 56:46.779
You know, what was it like
to make a deal

56:46.780 --> 56:48.200
with the U.S. Government?

56:48.201 --> 56:53.242
What was it like to accidentally
tell someone what you were doing

56:53.243 --> 56:57.371
and to watch them possibly
have to suffer the consequences

56:57.372 --> 56:59.332
of your lack of integrity?

56:59.333 --> 57:03.336
What was it like
to lie to your wife

57:03.337 --> 57:05.508
and tell her
that you were doing one thing

57:05.509 --> 57:07.051
when you were doing another?

57:07.052 --> 57:09.514
What was it like
when your wife found out

57:09.515 --> 57:11.260
what you were really doing?

57:11.261 --> 57:14.183
These are the questions
that I had long before

57:14.184 --> 57:15.433
I had seen The Shining again

57:15.434 --> 57:18.561
after a maybe an eight...
or nine-year absence.

57:18.562 --> 57:23.022
And I didn't... wasn't sure
I was right for the first hour.

57:23.023 --> 57:25.276
I wasn't sure
that I had actually...

57:25.277 --> 57:27.744
you know, I wasn't sure
if I was blurring the line

57:27.745 --> 57:32.031
between what I wanted to see
and what I was seeing.

57:32.032 --> 57:34.704
And then at about
58 minutes in the film

57:34.705 --> 57:37.954
is the famous scene where
Danny's playing with his trucks,

57:37.955 --> 57:39.956
and he stands up

57:39.957 --> 57:41.709
and he's wearing
the Apollo 11 sweater

57:41.710 --> 57:43.626
with the rocket taking off.

57:43.627 --> 57:46.545
Then I knew I'd nabbed it.

57:46.546 --> 57:50.466
And then I started watching
the film with an intensity

57:50.467 --> 57:53.061
that I don't think I'd
ever watched a movie before,

57:53.062 --> 57:56.889
and every line
began ringing true.

57:56.890 --> 58:02.019
You know, "Wendy, that is
just so typical of you.

58:02.020 --> 58:03.363
"Don't you... don't you know

58:03.364 --> 58:05.898
"I have obligations
to my employers?

58:05.899 --> 58:09.026
"Do you have any idea
what a contract is?

58:09.027 --> 58:11.075
Do you know
what an agreement is?"

58:11.076 --> 58:15.366
jack Nicholson's whole tirade
against his wife...

58:15.367 --> 58:17.702
that's Stanley.

58:17.703 --> 58:21.626
That's Stanley telling his wife
that after she discovered

58:21.627 --> 58:24.593
what he was doing,
which was the Apollo footage.

58:44.896 --> 58:46.318
No, that's actually not true.

58:46.319 --> 58:48.774
If you call
the Mount Hood Resort

58:48.775 --> 58:50.818
and you ask for room 217

58:50.819 --> 58:53.163
you will find
there is no such room.

58:53.164 --> 58:54.947
So that's just not true.

58:54.948 --> 58:56.991
That statement's not true.

58:56.992 --> 59:00.870
And so what...

59:00.871 --> 59:02.455
Stanley was lying.

59:02.456 --> 59:04.629
Its not the reason
that he changed the room number

59:04.630 --> 59:07.668
from 217 to 237.

59:07.669 --> 59:11.464
The reason that
he changed it from 217 to 237

59:11.465 --> 59:17.178
was because the room,
room 237 in the film is...

59:17.179 --> 59:20.900
represents the moon landing
stage where he worked.

59:25.062 --> 59:30.524
And the moon, the standard
science textbook said...

59:30.525 --> 59:32.026
and they still say...

59:32.027 --> 59:35.156
but now with lasers, we've
gotten a little better reading.

59:35.157 --> 59:39.784
But... is that
the mean distance of the moon

59:39.785 --> 59:44.038
from the earth
is exactly 237,000 miles.

59:44.039 --> 59:47.213
So he changed that
so that you would understand

59:47.214 --> 59:49.460
that this was the moon room.

59:49.461 --> 59:51.170
So Danny stands up.

59:51.171 --> 59:53.589
He's got
the Apollo 11 sweater on.

59:53.590 --> 59:56.592
He begins
walking down the hallway

59:56.593 --> 59:58.761
towards room 237.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:01.680
And there's a key in the lock.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.557
And on the key are...

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:07.978
is the words "room"
and then the word "n-o,"

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:11.482
which is an old acronym
for "number."

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:13.192
So "room number 237,"

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:16.117
except that the only
capital letters on the key

01:00:16.118 --> 01:00:20.574
are r-o-o-m and then the "n"
from the acronym n-o.

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:23.916
And if there's only two words
that you can come up with

01:00:23.917 --> 01:00:25.958
that have those letters in 'em.

01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:27.708
And that's "moon" and "room."

01:00:27.709 --> 01:00:32.962
And so on the key, the tag,
it says "moon room."

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.383
And that is the moon room.

01:00:34.384 --> 01:00:35.758
This is where
everything happens,

01:00:35.759 --> 01:00:37.299
and none of it's real.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.552
And it all has to be lied about.

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:42.306
And he can't let anyone know
what's really going on

01:00:42.307 --> 01:00:44.932
in room 237.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:48.936
And there's many, many other
deviations from the book

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:50.062
to the movie.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:51.730
- It isn't real.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:54.780
- The deviations drove
Stephen King out of his mind.

01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:57.486
He just ranted
and ranted for years

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.572
how much he hated The Shining.

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:01.450
And he hated it
because he'd given Kubrick

01:01:01.451 --> 01:01:02.950
all this great source material

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:05.578
and Kubrick threw it out.

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:10.708
And the whole idea of this
is best exemplified

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:13.335
by the scene
where Dick Hallorann

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:15.007
is driving up the highway,

01:01:15.008 --> 01:01:18.009
trying to get to the Overlook
during a winter storm

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:20.259
and he passes a wreck.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:23.429
And in the wreck,
a semi has crashed

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:27.224
and crushed a red Volkswagen.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:31.103
And this is a direct message
from Kubrick to King,

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.272
because in the novel,

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:36.734
Jack Torrance's car
is a red Volkswagen.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:39.156
But in the movie,
it's a yellow Volkswagen.

01:01:39.157 --> 01:01:41.623
And what Kubrick
is saying in that scene

01:01:41.624 --> 01:01:44.742
is a big "F you"
to Stephen King.

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:47.912
He's saying,
'This is my vehicle.

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:49.955
"I have wrecked your vehicle.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:52.917
And everybody in the world
can see it.'

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:54.636
And this drove King crazy.

01:01:54.637 --> 01:01:56.295
And it should have.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.798
But what was really going on

01:01:57.799 --> 01:02:03.969
and what is just much more
deliciously fascinating

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.264
about all of this
is that, in fact,

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:11.560
Kubrick was faking the making
of the Stephen King novel

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:15.481
in order to reveal the idea
of what he went through

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:17.951
to do the Apollo moon footage.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.498
- My argument,
as far as Kubrick goes,

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:32.841
is that he was a
preternaturally observant child.

01:02:32.842 --> 01:02:35.000
He read omnivorously.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:37.169
He went to movies all the time.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:41.095
And I think if you're going to
movies and reading in the 1930s

01:02:41.096 --> 01:02:45.219
and the 1940s, a lot of what
you're seeing and reading

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:49.223
is Hitler and the Nazis
and the war.

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:55.521
So as a sensitive kid, he must
have been alive to these things.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:58.617
And I don't think he ever forgot
anything, and this is...

01:02:58.618 --> 01:03:01.157
which is why his films
are so rich.

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:04.863
- Little pigs, little pigs,

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:06.832
let me come in.

01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:11.625
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:17.543
Then I'll huff and I'll puff...

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:19.086
- And I'll blow your house in!

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:20.304
- Well,
The Three Little Pigs,

01:03:20.305 --> 01:03:21.924
I mean, I don't remember...

01:03:21.925 --> 01:03:24.472
That might have been one of
the things

01:03:24.473 --> 01:03:27.052
that Jack Nicholson

01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:29.096
might've ad-libbed initially.

01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:30.895
Kubrick was a great believer
in that.

01:03:30.896 --> 01:03:34.310
But even if it was,
I think the selection

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:38.314
of that particular little rhyme

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:41.775
certainly fits in
with the time periodization

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:43.369
I've just been talking about,

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:47.281
because Kubrick
would've run across that

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:49.535
when he saw
The Three Little Pigs

01:03:49.536 --> 01:03:53.412
as an Academy Award winning
cartoon in 1933.

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:56.749
And so it comes
out of that period.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:04:01.712
And so the whole idea of a wolf,
which, during the 1930s,

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:08.260
gradually transformed itself
in popular mythology

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:11.096
and popular culture
from being a symbol

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:16.185
of want and of hunger
in the Great Depression

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:19.730
into a symbol of enemies;

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:22.608
Enemy nations,
enemy peoples,

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:23.904
military aggression.

01:04:23.905 --> 01:04:26.824
And of course, this reflects
the rise of fascism

01:04:26.825 --> 01:04:28.118
and Nazis in Europe.

01:04:28.119 --> 01:04:31.450
But initially,
the wolf at the door

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:35.954
was an anti-Semitic
stereotype and caricature

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:39.917
that... initially the wolf
wears a disguise.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:41.135
And the background music

01:04:41.136 --> 01:04:44.671
is clearly Eastern European
sort of klezmer

01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:46.298
or Yiddish music.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:49.093
And it's a classic example

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:53.430
of early 1930s
Walt Disney anti-Semitism.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.475
So I think there
are layers of meaning

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.315
in The Three Little Pigs."

01:04:58.316 --> 01:05:00.312
And since Kubrick
was a Freudian

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:04.608
and we know
that he used Freudian work

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:07.533
in doing the screenplay
for The Shining...

01:05:07.534 --> 01:05:10.781
Bruno Bettelheim's
The Uses of Enchantment...

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:14.455
and it's a Freudian analysis
of the meaning of fairy tales.

01:05:14.456 --> 01:05:17.167
And in The Shining,
we can see the fruits of that

01:05:17.168 --> 01:05:20.332
when they're constantly making
references to Hansel and Gretel.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.880
- I feel like I'll have
to leave a trail of bread crumbs

01:05:21.881 --> 01:05:23.715
every time we come in here.

01:05:23.716 --> 01:05:25.838
- The witch in the oven
and children being burned

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:27.303
and so forth,
which of course,

01:05:27.304 --> 01:05:31.223
is also perhaps, suggestive
when it comes to the Holocaust.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:37.771
- The blood
is one of the main ghosts

01:05:37.772 --> 01:05:39.813
and perhaps
the overarching ghost,

01:05:39.814 --> 01:05:41.525
in a certain sense,
in this movie.

01:05:41.526 --> 01:05:45.107
We first see it when Danny,
at the beginning of the movie,

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:46.576
is at the sink
in the little apartment

01:05:46.577 --> 01:05:50.863
down in Denver or Boulder
or wherever it is.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.241
And he's talking to Danny,

01:05:52.242 --> 01:05:53.867
"Why don't
you want to go there?"

01:05:56.411 --> 01:06:00.041
And then suddenly
Danny shows him blood.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.750
And as we learn
a little bit later,

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:06.675
the Overlook was built
on the Indian burial ground

01:06:06.676 --> 01:06:08.338
between 1907 and 1909.

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:10.841
- Construction started in 1907.

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:13.010
It was finished in 1909.

01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:14.354
The site
is supposed to be located

01:06:14.355 --> 01:06:15.721
on an Indian burial ground,

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.142
and I believe they actually had

01:06:17.143 --> 01:06:19.689
to repel a few Indian attacks
as they were building it.

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:24.607
- So presumably,
we can imagine the elevator

01:06:24.608 --> 01:06:27.951
shaft sinks down into
the very bodies of the Indians,

01:06:27.952 --> 01:06:29.151
so to speak.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.153
And that's where
the blood is coming from;

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.122
Literal blood of the Indians.

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:52.305
And this movie is a movie about,
among other things,

01:06:52.306 --> 01:06:55.219
the blood on which
nations are built;

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.390
Certainly the United States,

01:06:56.391 --> 01:06:59.106
with the genocide
of the American Indians.

01:06:59.107 --> 01:07:00.933
But it's not only that.

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:04.279
This is a complete metaphor
for what Kubrick is on about,

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.565
because the elevator's doors
remain closed.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:10.737
In other words,
it's as if it's like a symbol

01:07:10.738 --> 01:07:11.949
of the repression.

01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:13.409
We don't want to admit to it.

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:16.870
But in spite of our attempting
to stay repressed about it,

01:07:16.871 --> 01:07:18.617
blood will out,
murder will out,

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.586
as Chaucer says
in one of his tales.

01:07:20.587 --> 01:07:26.291
And so the blood comes
squeezing out from the side

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:27.960
and overwhelms us.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:31.682
And it keeps recurring
over and over through the movie.

01:07:31.683 --> 01:07:33.298
And it's...

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:36.390
And finally Wendy, when,
at the very end of the movie,

01:07:36.391 --> 01:07:37.888
she starts seeing ghosts.

01:07:37.889 --> 01:07:39.139
She sees the blood.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:43.141
It's the symbol
of what we all have in common.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:44.359
And there's
lots of symbols in here

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.899
of what all humans
have in common.

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:52.442
- 42 shows up in other places.

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:56.905
Wendy and Danny
watch The Summer of '42

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.407
on a hotel television.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.993
And there are
a number of other

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:03.122
little references
to that number.

01:08:03.123 --> 01:08:05.249
And it's within a larger context

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:08.834
that Kubrick uses involving
numbers in The Shining.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.008
And they're all
multiples of seven.

01:08:11.009 --> 01:08:14.339
The hotel was built in 1907.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.640
The party in which Jack
is pictured at the end of film

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.470
occurred in 1921 in July,

01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:24.015
the seventh month of the year.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:29.770
These multiples of seven,
I think,

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:30.944
also reflect the fact

01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:34.151
that Kubrick was aware
of the importance

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:38.029
of Thomas Mann's novel of 1924,
The Magic Mountain,

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:41.033
which similarly concerns
a sanitarium...

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:44.578
though not a hotel...
high up in the mountains.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:51.627
And Mann uses the number 7
there as a matter,

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:56.756
a symbol of
the sort of dangerous fate

01:08:56.758 --> 01:09:00.228
that seems to have been
stalking Europe lately.

01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:13.649
And in the novel Lolita,
Nabokov uses the number 42

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.109
as a symbol of fate
and Humbert's paranoia,

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:19.738
the idea that
he is constantly being tracked

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.537
and that his life is doomed.

01:09:21.537 --> 01:09:24.868
And even though Kubrick,
in his film of Lolita,

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:27.287
only uses the number once,

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:30.085
interestingly enough
on a hotel room door,

01:09:30.086 --> 01:09:32.711
I think at some level
of consciousness,

01:09:32.712 --> 01:09:36.462
Kubrick was always
also drawing from Nabokov's use

01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:38.298
of that particular number

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:44.602
as a symbol of danger
and malevolence and disaster.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:53.236
- The opening sound
is from the great funeral mass,

01:09:53.237 --> 01:09:56.108
Dies Irae,
which is the day of judgment,

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:58.155
which announces,
"This is going to be a funeral.

01:09:58.156 --> 01:10:00.496
"This is going to be about
a judgment on the human race."

01:10:00.497 --> 01:10:02.155
It's about the past.

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:05.701
But I think I remembered

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:09.204
that my impression
from the opening scene

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.501
in which that astonishing
helicopter shot

01:10:11.502 --> 01:10:13.627
gives you
a totally creepy feeling.

01:10:13.628 --> 01:10:16.962
You're looking at great,
beautiful nature,

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:19.341
but you know
you're following something.

01:10:19.342 --> 01:10:20.592
You're, like, flying along

01:10:20.593 --> 01:10:24.302
on top of this little,
tiny, insignificant car.

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.518
It's the ultimate
point of view shot

01:10:26.519 --> 01:10:28.974
without telling you
who the point of view is.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:30.318
If you want
to stop and think about it,

01:10:30.319 --> 01:10:32.399
you think,
'This is a helicopter shot"

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.608
But for the general audience,

01:10:33.609 --> 01:10:35.731
all you know is that
you are like a ghost.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.152
You are like an angel.

01:10:37.153 --> 01:10:38.275
You are like something

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:41.027
that flies
with supernatural abilities

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:44.322
across the landscape
of the planet.

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:48.326
And the soundtrack had
that skittering...

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:49.578
I can't imitate it...

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:52.205
but that skittering music
that sounded to me...

01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:54.504
and I was conscious of this
the first time I saw the movie...

01:10:54.505 --> 01:10:58.086
like the thousands
of voices from the past.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:01.339
"The cloud of witness,"
as the phrase is in...

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.800
Dorothy Sayers uses it
as the title for some story.

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.849
The cloud of witness,
all the ghosts from the past;

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:07.017
And I didn't know.

01:11:07.018 --> 01:11:10.515
Were these the voices
of the many crowds

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:13.310
of aliens or of ghosts or...

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.358
I didn't know what.

01:11:14.359 --> 01:11:17.564
But already that
skittering, high music

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:19.693
with that follow shot
across the lake

01:11:19.694 --> 01:11:24.362
and then across the car itself,

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:26.072
it was the ultimate in spooky

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:28.200
because you had the feeling
this car is being followed

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:30.078
and it doesn't know it,
and we're following it.

01:11:30.079 --> 01:11:32.078
I mean, I could go on
for a long time

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:35.707
about the symbolism of that

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.632
with regard to what The Shining
really is.

01:11:38.633 --> 01:11:41.963
And The Shining,
as we come to understand it,

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:44.511
is seeing through
all the layers of history

01:11:44.512 --> 01:11:46.098
and the horrors of history,

01:11:46.099 --> 01:11:48.345
even autobiographically
in that scene

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:55.393
where Grady and Jack talk
in the blood-red men's room

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:57.646
and Grady says, "Your son
has a very great talent.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.149
"I don't think
you realize how great it is.

01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:00.398
He's a very willful boy."

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:01.399
And Jack says, "Yes, he is..."

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.527
- A very willful boy.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:06.112
- Did you know, Mr. Torrance,

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:11.159
that your son is attempting
to bring an outside party

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.828
into this situation?

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:15.038
- That's Kubrick.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:16.915
What he's trying to do
is bring the audience

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:19.292
and humanity
into this situation.

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:24.130
In this movie, he is trying
to get through to us all...

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:26.633
the human race in the movie
theaters watching this...

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:30.095
that we are doing these things
but don't see it,

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:32.806
that we are committing
these horrendous things

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.182
over and over again
and then forgetting them...

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.526
which is... of course,
he represents

01:12:35.527 --> 01:12:37.566
many, many times in the movie...

01:12:37.567 --> 01:12:40.897
by having characters
seem to know something

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:42.696
and then not know it
and forget it.

01:12:42.697 --> 01:12:49.823
- You, uh, chopped your wife and
daughter up into little bits.

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:52.327
- I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

01:12:52.328 --> 01:12:53.665
- That's like the human race.

01:12:53.666 --> 01:12:55.880
We commit atrocities
and then forget it.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.302
- Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

01:13:07.303 --> 01:13:08.300
- How do you do?

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:09.301
- Bill, how do you do?

01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.302
- It's nice to meet you.

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:11.303
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:13.346
- Some people think that,

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.691
like, not all
of the interview is real.

01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:18.894
Some of it is Jack's
imagination or fantasy

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:23.940
of what the interview
would be like.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:28.862
Like, also, Bill Watson's
clothes change.

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:31.531
Like,
his pants change patterns.

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:32.908
And what's also weird is,

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:36.334
he plays Pontius Pilate
in Jesus Christ Superstar.

01:13:36.335 --> 01:13:37.662
- ♪ Crucify him ♪

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:38.705
♪ Crucify him ♪

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:41.583
♪ Crucify, crucify, crucify ♪

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:42.881
- Really playing against type

01:13:42.882 --> 01:13:45.712
and just being
this sort of cipher.

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:51.301
I mean, in a way he's,
he's kind of Jack's double

01:13:51.302 --> 01:13:54.772
kind of in the same way that
Bill Hartford has a double

01:13:54.773 --> 01:13:57.891
in Eyes Wide Shut.

01:13:57.892 --> 01:14:00.983
You know, he goes
to that blonde woman's house

01:14:00.984 --> 01:14:02.321
whose father just died

01:14:02.322 --> 01:14:05.857
and her fiancé looks
exactly like Tom Cruise,

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:06.859
has the same haircut.

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:12.159
- I've always thought that Bill
Watson, the little assistant...

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.706
and by little, I mean that he's
sort of a shrunken figure...

01:14:15.707 --> 01:14:19.329
to Ullman, who's brought in
and sits there

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:22.874
looking sort of dour
and resentful and quiet

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:27.128
and whose skin color
is sort of a half...

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:28.129
it's not white.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.548
It's sort of toward brown.

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:34.554
I've always thought that he
sort of represents a subdued...

01:14:34.555 --> 01:14:36.393
somebody from a subdued race.

01:14:36.394 --> 01:14:39.393
He seems a little bit diffident
when Ullman says,

01:14:39.394 --> 01:14:41.313
"Will you go
collect their luggage?"

01:14:41.314 --> 01:14:42.310
He says, "Fine."

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:43.603
- Fine.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:45.698
- And as they're given the tour
around all the hotel,

01:14:45.699 --> 01:14:47.857
Bill Watson
is always trailing behind,

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:49.405
like somebody who's going
to be a little factotum

01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:50.777
to go get things.

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:52.654
I've always thought
he sort of maybe represented,

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:57.033
you know, the condition in
the dominant arrogant culture

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.332
that the Indians
had at that time.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:08.962
- He is the silent guardian

01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:10.922
for the government.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:15.093
Stewart Ullman represents
the face of the U.S. government.

01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:16.937
And that's why Kubrick
gave him the toupee

01:15:16.938 --> 01:15:19.931
that makes him look like
John F. Kennedy.

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:23.643
And I think that he is the guy

01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:27.480
who's silently watching
everything and, you know...

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:29.149
CIA, I guess.

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.109
Kind of NSA guy.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:34.279
And he probably represents

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.491
the real managers of the house,

01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:42.287
of the Overlook,
and Barry Nelson is the...

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:44.416
just the person
that's out in front.

01:15:44.417 --> 01:15:46.458
- He doesn't say a thing.

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:47.798
He's the summer caretaker.

01:15:47.799 --> 01:15:49.007
And he seems to me

01:15:49.008 --> 01:15:51.131
to have certain
correspondences with Wendy.

01:15:51.132 --> 01:15:53.383
Jack really doesn't
work around the hotel.

01:15:53.384 --> 01:15:55.678
Wendy gets in there,
and she does all the work.

01:15:55.679 --> 01:15:58.598
- You do get the feeling
that he's going...

01:15:58.599 --> 01:16:00.519
that Jack's going
to be doing his work,

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:04.100
because he seems a little,
like, leery of Jack.

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:05.477
Like, I've been
in job interviews,

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:07.479
and I've always found
that that second person

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.857
they call in is,
like, the person

01:16:08.858 --> 01:16:11.566
you're actually
interviewing for.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.911
He's making the decision,
like, that silent person,

01:16:13.912 --> 01:16:18.323
that, like...
kind of, like, glare...

01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:20.533
like, squints at you.

01:16:20.534 --> 01:16:26.664
Yeah, and he sighs when he's
asked to move Jack's luggage.

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:28.166
- Bill, would you have
the Torrances' things

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:29.214
brought to their apartment?

01:16:29.215 --> 01:16:30.427
- Fine.

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:37.722
- There's a dissolve
which fades from a wide shot

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:40.767
of the, you know,
final black-and-white photo

01:16:40.768 --> 01:16:43.098
to a close-up of Jack's face.

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:46.935
And just for a second there,

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:50.782
his hairline fades in
to form a Hitler moustache.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.789
- I think a lot of things
happened right here

01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:05.829
in this particular hotel
over the years

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:08.299
and not all of 'em was good.

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:11.584
- He once said,

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:12.880
"How do you get all of that"...

01:17:12.881 --> 01:17:13.970
meaning the Holocaust...

01:17:13.971 --> 01:17:15.797
"into a two-hour movie?"

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:22.428
I think he found the Holocaust
of such evil magnitude

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:24.773
that he just couldn't
bring himself

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:26.891
to treat it directly,

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:31.771
which is why he used
the form of a horror film

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:34.149
to treat it indirectly.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:37.819
- I believe Kubrick,
possibly consciously,

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:43.074
has solved a kind of problem
that history has,

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:46.244
which is that
it's very hard for many people

01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:49.169
to connect emotionally
to a gigantic big killing

01:17:49.170 --> 01:17:50.957
we hear about in the past.

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:53.585
People who don't have
direct family experience

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.712
of it themselves
may hear the statistic.

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:57.135
You know, Hitler,
among other things,

01:17:57.136 --> 01:17:59.177
killed 6 million Jews
in his Holocaust.

01:17:59.178 --> 01:18:00.677
6 million's a number too big.

01:18:00.678 --> 01:18:03.054
I mean Stalin is reputed
to have said, you know,

01:18:03.055 --> 01:18:05.224
"You kill one person,
it's a murder and a tragedy.

01:18:05.225 --> 01:18:07.849
"You kill a million people,
it's a statistic."

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:11.644
He was talking about
a psychological fact.

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:14.898
And, you know, Stalin himself
was... what is it...

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.321
starved about 3 million people

01:18:16.322 --> 01:18:19.867
in the western Ukraine
in the '30s on purpose.

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:25.283
My point is
it may be that Kubrick

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:27.956
was conscious of having
offered a kind of way to bridge

01:18:27.957 --> 01:18:32.170
that inability to feel for those
gigantic statistics in that,

01:18:32.171 --> 01:18:34.713
if you go and see The Shining
innocent the first time

01:18:34.714 --> 01:18:37.212
and are terrified...
you're just terrified

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:40.092
and you'll always remember
being terrified...

01:18:40.093 --> 01:18:44.010
and then go back
aware of what the symbolism

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:47.728
and the general larger pattern
meanings of the movie are,

01:18:47.729 --> 01:18:50.772
then you can begin to make
something of a connection,

01:18:50.773 --> 01:18:53.102
saying, "Oh, my God."

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:54.320
I remember being terrified

01:18:54.321 --> 01:18:57.941
for the individual
little Danny and Wendy here.

01:18:57.942 --> 01:19:01.361
And that feeling is actually
being...

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:03.740
is for people who are symbols
of victims

01:19:03.741 --> 01:19:06.583
of all kinds
of horrendous genocides.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:13.706
And of course, his wife
has subsequently talked about,

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:16.005
you know, how close he came
to making his Holocaust movie,

01:19:16.006 --> 01:19:18.628
The Aryan Papers,
but that he got mom and mom

01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:20.343
and more depressed
and was relieved

01:19:20.344 --> 01:19:22.182
when he had an excuse
not to do it.

01:19:22.183 --> 01:19:24.717
He used Schindler's List
as saying,

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:26.140
"Ah, it's already been done."

01:19:26.141 --> 01:19:29.347
I mean,
that struck a bell with me.

01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:31.442
And I've done a lot
of stories as a journalist

01:19:31.443 --> 01:19:34.894
about people who study...

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:37.193
either talked to people
who are victims of horrors

01:19:37.194 --> 01:19:38.606
or study it.

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:41.197
And there's... Freud talked
about it as the contagion.

01:19:41.198 --> 01:19:42.694
The depression seeps into you.

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:47.073
It's... you know what...
Kubrick had a wonderful comment

01:19:47.074 --> 01:19:49.327
about this
when somebody asked him.

01:19:49.328 --> 01:19:52.421
"Isn't it true that
your movies are showing us

01:19:52.422 --> 01:19:55.581
"just the horrendous side
of humanity.

01:19:55.582 --> 01:19:57.300
You know, that's awful bleak."

01:19:57.301 --> 01:19:58.501
And Kubrick said,

01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:02.219
"Ah, but there's something
very positive about it as well.

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.716
"And that is,
it shows at the very least

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:07.764
that we can get our minds
around what that horror is."

01:20:07.765 --> 01:20:09.432
And Danny,
from the beginning,

01:20:09.433 --> 01:20:10.894
has his mind
all over the problem.

01:20:10.895 --> 01:20:12.103
He's looking at it.

01:20:12.104 --> 01:20:15.065
In a way, Danny's
big wheeling back and forth,

01:20:15.066 --> 01:20:16.230
up and down the hallways...

01:20:16.231 --> 01:20:18.062
Danny is learning that hotel.

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:19.063
He's learning all the horrors.

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:20.064
He's seeing them.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.357
But they're just in the past,

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:22.734
and Hallorann
gave him the secret.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.449
He said, "Remember, Danny."

01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:26.279
Remember what Tony tells him.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.530
Remember
what Mr. Hallorann said:

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:29.078
"They're just like
pictures in a book.

01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:31.034
They're not real."

01:20:31.035 --> 01:20:34.912
Now, that's
a really important lesson.

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:37.290
People who shine,
who see through history,

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:41.794
understand that the past
simply does not exist

01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:43.046
except in one place.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:44.970
And that's the present tense
instant of the mind,

01:20:44.971 --> 01:20:46.007
remembering.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:49.763
That is, exactly... that is
a place you can go to somehow

01:20:49.764 --> 01:20:51.679
and yet it doesn't exist.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.891
And so Hallorann tells Danny,

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:56.144
"You're gonna see
some horrible things."

01:20:56.145 --> 01:20:57.143
Apparently, he told him.

01:20:57.144 --> 01:20:58.394
"You're gonna see
some horrible things,

01:20:58.395 --> 01:20:59.565
"but remember,
they're not real.

01:20:59.566 --> 01:21:00.780
"They're like
pictures in a book.

01:21:00.781 --> 01:21:02.899
They no longer exist."

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:06.029
That's a key to not
getting depressed about it.

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:11.282
And that's...

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:15.328
You see, this is a movie
about what the past...

01:21:15.329 --> 01:21:18.873
how the past impinges,
any past,

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.875
and about
how to get over that

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.844
and how not to be
a victim of history.

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:27.300
You know, if you doubt
what I've written about it,

01:21:27.301 --> 01:21:28.800
just go see the movie.

01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:30.678
I've figured all this out
from just seeing the movie.

01:21:30.679 --> 01:21:31.969
It's there.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.811
It's obvious, and most people
who went and saw the movie said,

01:21:33.812 --> 01:21:35.023
"Oh, my goodness.
It is there."

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:43.856
- Okay.

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:47.151
Yeah, I was, I mean, obsessed
with The Shining

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:52.824
and reading all
the online analyses of it

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:55.451
and was particularly
a big fan

01:21:55.452 --> 01:22:00.128
of the MSTRMND's lengthy
analysis of it.

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:05.211
And he had one phrase
that kind of stuck in my mind,

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:08.297
that The Shining was a film

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:11.677
meant to be seen
forwards and backwards.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:16.681
And, I mean,
he didn't mean at the same time.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:22.812
He meant that in,
with the mirror form metaphor

01:22:22.813 --> 01:22:27.358
that's central to the film

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:30.778
that things, you know...

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.700
that things
forwards and backwards

01:22:32.701 --> 01:22:34.166
happen throughout the film.

01:22:34.167 --> 01:22:39.162
That... people walk backwards
in the film, you know,

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:40.210
people talk backwards.

01:22:40.211 --> 01:22:43.040
- Redrum.
Redrum.

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:45.668
- You know,
if you reverse the film,

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:49.797
it has a format similar to 2001.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.766
All these kind of things happen.

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:53.718
At the end of The Shining,

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:55.558
he's reduced to a screaming ape,

01:22:55.559 --> 01:22:57.143
just like in the beginning
of 2001,

01:22:57.144 --> 01:22:58.231
there are screaming apes.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:07.982
But I was talking to my pals
at the Spectacle Theater,

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:12.487
riffing about experimental ways
of showing films.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:14.206
And they were like,
"Well, do you think

01:23:14.207 --> 01:23:16.908
"you could
come up with something,

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:18.411
you know, to show here?"

01:23:18.412 --> 01:23:22.083
I was like, "Sure, what we
should do is we should show

01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:24.752
The Shining forwards
and backwards at the same time.

01:23:24.753 --> 01:23:27.253
"You know not...
let's not be creative.

01:23:27.254 --> 01:23:29.921
"Let's just actually
reverse the film

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:34.018
and show it exactly mirrored,
superimposed."

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:42.101
The first image
is of the reflective lake.

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:48.648
And the last image
is of the inscription

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:49.862
on the photograph,

01:23:49.863 --> 01:23:52.452
in which Jack is frozen
for all time...

01:23:52.453 --> 01:23:56.197
The "Overlook Hotel,
July 4th Ball, 1921."

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:59.283
So those superimposed make it...

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:02.288
kind of make it seem like
a postcard, like an invitation.

01:24:02.289 --> 01:24:03.287
Like...

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:08.417
"Come to the July 4th Ball
here in Crater Lake."

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:12.505
There's a really cool part
where, like, you know,

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:16.217
the helicopters
are following his car

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:20.638
and his name scrolls up
in the credits

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:24.809
and, like, meets the car,
right...

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:29.313
right in the same position
where the grid of photographs,

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:32.154
right in that photograph
that he's trapped in.

01:24:32.155 --> 01:24:34.824
So his car,
his name and his photograph

01:24:34.825 --> 01:24:37.446
all line up for one second.

01:24:37.447 --> 01:24:38.447
Pretty cool.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:43.494
The interview has a, like...
it's great.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:45.166
While they're talking about...

01:24:45.167 --> 01:24:47.790
you know, very dryly about
all the murders that happened,

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:49.755
like, you know,
in the superimposition,

01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:52.595
Jack's running around with an
axe going bananas, you know.

01:24:55.882 --> 01:25:00.428
There's a lot of just great,
great, great superimpositions

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:04.307
of people's faces lining up,
like Jack's...

01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:08.019
Jack's, like,
got the death look,

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.567
and he's staring
through Danny's face

01:25:09.568 --> 01:25:12.362
as Danny's eating a sandwich.

01:25:13.859 --> 01:25:16.902
Then there's a lot of things...
there's a lot of, like...

01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:18.654
there's a... you know,
there's some fun jokes,

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.373
but then there's
serious stuff where,

01:25:20.374 --> 01:25:22.241
like, you...

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:26.495
where the hallucination...
the visions that Danny has,

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:28.122
where you'll see them,

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:30.376
like, overlaid
on top of other situations.

01:25:30.377 --> 01:25:33.379
Like the twin girls
are overlaid on top of Wendy,

01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:35.504
which, if you study the film,

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:38.554
you see that the twins
are associated with Wendy.

01:25:38.555 --> 01:25:42.219
They're like her,
like, visionary counterpart.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:45.556
All the symbols
in the movie start...

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:48.142
overlap
in the superimposition,

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:50.771
backwards/forwards
superimposition.

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:56.484
The murdered twins
are overlaid across Jack's face,

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.611
and he looks like a clown.

01:25:58.612 --> 01:26:00.488
It makes like a clown mask,

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:01.991
and there's blood everywhere

01:26:01.992 --> 01:26:03.741
and, like, blood on his lips.

01:26:04.951 --> 01:26:07.745
And blood
coming out of his eyes.

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:11.999
And, like, you know,
Danny takes it...

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.547
you know, like, Danny
has his hands over his face,

01:26:13.548 --> 01:26:17.463
and it's... Jack is looking out
from his head,

01:26:17.464 --> 01:26:22.343
and then he open... he, like,
peeks out and he sees Grady.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:26.764
And then Grady and Jack
continue their conversation

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:27.982
into the next scene,

01:26:27.983 --> 01:26:31.686
which is where
he's watching television.

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:33.781
And it's like they have this...

01:26:33.782 --> 01:26:36.273
their lips
are, like, in the TV.

01:26:36.274 --> 01:26:38.743
Jack and Grady's lips
are in the TV.

01:26:38.744 --> 01:26:42.988
And these masks
are formed by the windows.

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:46.283
And ifs like
Danny's envisioning this.

01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:49.954
Danny's envisioning...

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:54.291
you know, envisioning the pact
between Grady and jack.

01:26:54.292 --> 01:27:00.840
Like, he goes into...
he sneaks into the bedroom,

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:02.388
like, right through
Jack's head,

01:27:02.389 --> 01:27:05.094
right in between them.

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:10.141
And just like that scene is...

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:13.519
that's the scene
where Danny is testing

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.364
his father, like,
"Do you really, you know!"...

01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:18.357
"Do you like this place?

01:27:18.358 --> 01:27:19.780
You're not gonna hurt us,
are you?"

01:27:19.781 --> 01:27:22.996
Like, Danny kind of knows
that his dad has lost it.

01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:31.203
The last shot is 1921,

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:36.792
and the first shot
is of the road.

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:39.467
Ullman mentions
that it was finished in 1921.

01:27:39.468 --> 01:27:43.716
So it's, again, it's a way
of returning the narrative

01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:45.310
back to the beginning.

01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:02.786
- Mr. Hallorann,
what is in room 237?

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.280
- Nothing.

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:09.909
There ain't nothing in room 237.

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:13.255
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway,

01:28:13.256 --> 01:28:14.998
so stay out.

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:17.750
- In the sex room, 237,

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:20.630
where we see this beautiful,
sexual temptress,

01:28:20.631 --> 01:28:24.548
who then becomes
a rotting body...

01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:26.768
realistically depicted
as a rotting body...

01:28:26.769 --> 01:28:30.930
the design on the rug shows
basically the most...

01:28:30.931 --> 01:28:33.400
in geometric form
with round curves...

01:28:33.401 --> 01:28:36.143
the act of intercourse itself,

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.612
one after another
after another after another,

01:28:37.613 --> 01:28:38.729
sort of like a picture

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:42.608
of down through the generations
of what produces life.

01:28:42.609 --> 01:28:46.239
You go back out in the hallway,
in the larger society,

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.366
and the round curves
of that very same design

01:28:48.367 --> 01:28:50.658
have become hexagons,

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:52.878
not so nice and round,
and a little bit more

01:28:52.879 --> 01:28:54.912
like the beehive hexagon

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:57.209
but down the whole corridors
of history.

01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:58.925
I think he's got
an image of it there,

01:28:58.926 --> 01:29:02.002
so he's talking about
the family of man,

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:03.926
both in
an individual nuclear family

01:29:03.927 --> 01:29:07.301
and in the whole course
of our genetic history.

01:29:10.428 --> 01:29:15.766
- Once Denny enters room 237,
like, that's...

01:29:15.767 --> 01:29:17.314
that kind of is, like,
the activation

01:29:17.315 --> 01:29:20.729
of the rest of the movie.

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:27.069
Like, that's what causes Jack
to go insane finally.

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:32.042
That's what brings Hallorann
to the hotel.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:39.963
Like, the room 237 is, like,
is sort of this...

01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:45.838
I mean, I compare it
to the mysterious hotel room

01:29:45.839 --> 01:29:48.007
at the end of 2001,

01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:49.305
where there's...

01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:53.971
It's this strange,
strange place

01:29:53.972 --> 01:29:58.148
that somehow, like, transforms
the rest of the narrative.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.794
The Shining takes place
on the top of a mountain

01:30:19.795 --> 01:30:22.291
in kind of like a, you know,

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:26.045
magical shape-shifting
environment.

01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:29.632
And, like, travel is...

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:30.805
traveling out of it is...

01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:35.681
You know, instead of 2001, where
you're traveling to something,

01:30:35.682 --> 01:30:40.356
the point of The Shining
is to escape, is to travel out.

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:44.063
And room 237 is, like...

01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:50.569
it's kind of like
the escape pod of...

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:52.823
of the hotel.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:06.251
- If you multiply the numbers 2,
3 and 7, you get 42.

01:31:06.252 --> 01:31:09.347
Now, I admit, perhaps
I'm grasping at straws there,

01:31:09.348 --> 01:31:13.050
but it is consistent
with the pattern of reference

01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:14.551
in the film.

01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:16.975
- Another thing which
my film Kubrick's Odyssey

01:31:16.976 --> 01:31:19.473
really reveals

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:21.438
is the carpeting on the floor

01:31:21.439 --> 01:31:23.060
during the famous Danny scene,

01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:27.231
where he stands up
with his Apollo 11 shirt.

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:34.321
The patterns in the carpeting
exactly match launch pad 39-A.

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.996
You know, even the driveway
and everything.

01:31:36.997 --> 01:31:42.746
And if you notice in that shot,
the pattern on the rug changes

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:44.841
when Danny stands up.

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:48.836
- The carpet's reversed,

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:51.133
and there's
no pathway there anymore.

01:31:51.134 --> 01:31:54.761
The pathway that the ball took
rolling down towards Danny

01:31:54.762 --> 01:31:56.593
is gone now.

01:31:56.594 --> 01:31:58.434
It's no longer there
'cause it's reversed.

01:31:58.435 --> 01:32:00.558
And you get
a sense of a closure.

01:32:00.559 --> 01:32:02.309
Now the hexagon is closed.

01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:04.606
It's almost like
he's been closed in.

01:32:18.992 --> 01:32:20.710
- Seven years after
The Shining had come out,

01:32:20.711 --> 01:32:22.830
to my surprise,
nobody had written,

01:32:22.831 --> 01:32:24.293
as far as I could tell,

01:32:24.294 --> 01:32:26.633
about what the major themes
of the movie were,

01:32:26.634 --> 01:32:30.627
beyond the delightfully scary
immediate story

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:33.797
of the family
and the hotel itself.

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:38.052
And I was actually doing a story
somewhere over in Europe,

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:41.057
and I was told over the phone
that the posters were out

01:32:41.058 --> 01:32:42.353
for Full Metal Jacket.

01:32:42.354 --> 01:32:45.142
I asked about the description,

01:32:45.143 --> 01:32:48.647
and I was told it had a peace
sign right next to the words

01:32:48.648 --> 01:32:49.646
"Born to kill."

01:32:49.647 --> 01:32:50.898
And I said,
"Oh, my goodness.

01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:53.320
His next movie's gonna be
about some of the same themes."

01:32:53.321 --> 01:32:54.911
Anyway,
I thought, "My goodness."

01:32:54.912 --> 01:32:58.989
I had presumed that
it would have become obvious,

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:00.082
so I thought,
"What the heck?

01:33:00.083 --> 01:33:03.994
"I'll just see if I can write
an article about it

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:06.497
to give people more fun
when they see Full Metal Jacket,

01:33:06.498 --> 01:33:07.750
to know what
his last movie was about,

01:33:07.751 --> 01:33:09.046
in larger senses.

01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:18.675
- I've gotten a lot of flak
from people who work for NASA.

01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:21.473
And, you know, I want to tell
them, that I, you know,

01:33:21.474 --> 01:33:23.889
I'm not saying
that we didn't go to the moon.

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:25.516
And I'm not saying
that their technology

01:33:25.517 --> 01:33:26.856
that they helped build

01:33:26.857 --> 01:33:29.478
isn't great and awesome
and everything.

01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:31.355
I'm just saying
that what we saw was faked.

01:33:31.356 --> 01:33:33.607
And I know I have it proved

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:36.527
with the front-screen
projection process.

01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:39.488
As far as what
the government has done,

01:33:39.489 --> 01:33:42.661
I fully expect my taxes
to be audited next year,

01:33:42.662 --> 01:33:43.956
to be honest with you.

01:33:43.957 --> 01:33:49.164
And, you know,
I've had visitations, you know.

01:33:49.165 --> 01:33:52.005
And they're definitely
watching me for sure,

01:33:52.006 --> 01:33:54.711
and they're not too happy
with what's going on here.

01:33:54.712 --> 01:33:56.009
And I think
they're probably very worried

01:33:56.010 --> 01:33:58.048
about the next film.

01:33:58.049 --> 01:34:01.428
And that one will be
the really explosive film.

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:09.319
- We were walking
along the beach on vacation

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.479
with some people
in Costa Rica.

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:14.782
I had
this delightful experience.

01:34:14.783 --> 01:34:16.570
We were walking along
with a young couple

01:34:16.571 --> 01:34:18.286
who were from San Francisco.

01:34:18.287 --> 01:34:19.903
And it was a long walk.

01:34:19.904 --> 01:34:22.908
We'd gone through
this big, beautiful jungle.

01:34:22.909 --> 01:34:24.496
And were coming
back on the beach

01:34:24.497 --> 01:34:26.163
to walk back
to where the tent camp was.

01:34:26.164 --> 01:34:27.244
And the guy started...

01:34:27.245 --> 01:34:28.370
we started chatting
about Kubrick.

01:34:28.371 --> 01:34:29.463
I said, "Oh, Kubrick's great,"

01:34:29.464 --> 01:34:30.747
And the guy said, "You know,

01:34:30.748 --> 01:34:32.546
The Shining, it's actually
about the American Indians."

01:34:32.547 --> 01:34:33.589
I said, "Really?"

01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:37.087
And he went on talking,
and I said, "Really?"

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:39.928
And I just couldn't resist
just playing dumb for while

01:34:39.929 --> 01:34:41.847
while he told me
the whole thing.

01:34:42.844 --> 01:34:44.016
I was delighted!

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:53.103
♪ Dies irae, dies illa ♪

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:54.947
- Kubrick just sets up
synchronous space.

01:34:54.948 --> 01:34:57.232
His movies are...

01:34:57.233 --> 01:34:59.985
they create synchronous
situations in themselves.

01:34:59.986 --> 01:35:01.283
There's this man who says,
you know,

01:35:01.284 --> 01:35:02.905
"Quite a party, isn't it?"

01:35:02.906 --> 01:35:04.827
Why did Kubrick put him there,

01:35:04.828 --> 01:35:06.747
with the split down his head?

01:35:06.748 --> 01:35:08.493
Why did he put him there?

01:35:08.494 --> 01:35:10.462
And I was contemplating that.

01:35:10.463 --> 01:35:13.916
And in comes my son.

01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:16.257
And he was nine years old
at the time.

01:35:16.258 --> 01:35:17.966
And he didn't know
what I was working on.

01:35:17.967 --> 01:35:20.966
And he came in,
and he began to tell me a story.

01:35:20.967 --> 01:35:23.263
And he said,
"I've just thought this up."

01:35:23.264 --> 01:35:27.512
And his characters head was
split open with a chaos bolt.

01:35:27.513 --> 01:35:31.393
And the character says, "Talk
about a splitting headache."

01:35:31.394 --> 01:35:33.611
And out of the contents
of his head

01:35:33.612 --> 01:35:37.189
leaps a small person
who is his real self.

01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:39.659
And it goes running off,
saying in a high, squeaky voice,

01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:41.902
"Forget this.
I'm going home."

01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:45.451
And, yeah, I thought that was
really stunning synchronicity,

01:35:45.452 --> 01:35:47.997
I mean, 'cause you've got
all the elements there.

01:35:47.998 --> 01:35:49.243
You've got the ax.

01:35:49.244 --> 01:35:50.917
You've got the whole idea
of the lightning bolt,

01:35:50.918 --> 01:35:52.876
the chaos bolt,
striking the person's head,

01:35:52.877 --> 01:35:54.248
the splitting headache.

01:35:54.249 --> 01:35:55.832
You've got Tony...

01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:57.335
Tony's squeaky voice, yeah.

01:35:58.878 --> 01:36:00.968
I thought that was
quite a synchronicity.

01:36:00.969 --> 01:36:02.637
- One can always argue
that Kubrick

01:36:02.638 --> 01:36:06.551
had only some or even none
of these in mind.

01:36:06.552 --> 01:36:09.522
But we all know
from postmodern film criticism

01:36:09.523 --> 01:36:13.058
that author intent
is only part of the story

01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:14.977
of any work of art.

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:18.897
And those meanings
are there regardless

01:36:18.898 --> 01:36:22.484
of whether the creator
of the work

01:36:22.485 --> 01:36:24.027
was conscious of them.

01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:26.029
- I think... if you want
to know what I think,

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:28.451
I think the hotel
is so whacked out

01:36:28.452 --> 01:36:30.701
that I don't have any clue
what's going on

01:36:30.702 --> 01:36:32.202
from the beginning.

01:36:32.203 --> 01:36:34.456
When you really sit
and think about it, I mean...

01:36:34.457 --> 01:36:36.549
because the whole thing
is so whacked out,

01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:38.709
and it's so not put together...

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:42.045
it's so... everything
is so wildly out of place

01:36:42.046 --> 01:36:44.843
that when you...
the more... the closer you get

01:36:44.844 --> 01:36:48.013
into looking at things,
the more you look at them.

01:36:48.014 --> 01:36:51.606
It's kind of like, you know,
the scene in Eyes Wide Shut

01:36:51.607 --> 01:36:55.058
where Bill goes... you know,
he returns.

01:36:55.059 --> 01:36:56.893
He retraces his footsteps,

01:36:56.894 --> 01:37:00.814
and he goes back
to the mansion where he was.

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:03.442
And he's told, you know,
to stop your inquiries.

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:05.032
They will serve you no purpose.

01:37:05.033 --> 01:37:07.906
It's almost like it gets to that
with The Shining.

01:37:07.907 --> 01:37:10.784
The more you magnify things,
the more you look at them,

01:37:10.785 --> 01:37:14.581
the less purpose it serves
'cause it's so out of whack.

01:37:14.582 --> 01:37:17.247
None of it makes sense
from the beginning.

01:37:17.248 --> 01:37:18.716
- There must be
a lot of stuff in there

01:37:18.717 --> 01:37:21.126
that nobody has yet seen,

01:37:21.127 --> 01:37:23.425
so people
ought to keep watching it.

01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:32.888
- But why would he make
the movie so complicated?

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:38.894
- Yeah, I mean, but why did
Joyce write Finnegan's Wake?

01:37:40.605 --> 01:37:43.440
It's a way of, like,
opening doors

01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:45.614
from, like, a hermetically
sealed reality

01:37:45.615 --> 01:37:49.821
into possibilities.

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:52.541
And it's also a way of trapping
someone like me.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:59.581
Like, who goes looking for clues
and, like, keeps finding them.

01:37:59.582 --> 01:38:02.798
And next thing you know,
you're like, "Man, I've been...

01:38:02.799 --> 01:38:04.967
"I've been trapped
in this hotel forever.

01:38:04.968 --> 01:38:08.173
I'm dreaming about this place."

01:38:08.174 --> 01:38:09.299
You know, I'm like Jack.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.473
I'm, like,
all work and no play.

01:38:13.429 --> 01:38:14.474
Or the other way around.

01:38:14.475 --> 01:38:16.019
It doesn't really matter,
like...

01:38:17.975 --> 01:38:19.568
You're, like, in this loop.

01:38:23.481 --> 01:38:26.485
But, you know, there are
escape routes, like the...

01:38:26.486 --> 01:38:29.027
like, I think
he puts escape routes

01:38:29.028 --> 01:38:33.532
into it, into this maze,
into this trap.

01:38:33.533 --> 01:38:35.706
I mean,
there are ways out of it.

01:38:35.707 --> 01:38:38.829
And Danny finds a way out of it,

01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:41.206
you know,
by retracing his steps,

01:38:41.207 --> 01:38:43.084
by going backwards and forwards.

01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:48.048
And once you start, you know,
studying, you know,

01:38:48.049 --> 01:38:51.091
synchronicity and symbolism,

01:38:51.092 --> 01:38:52.180
then, like, suddenly, like,
