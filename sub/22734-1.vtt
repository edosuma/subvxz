01:06.339 --> 01:07.873
- Hello.
- Please sir, please.

01:07.875 --> 01:11.512
The Gestapo are chasing me,
may I take shelter in your home?

01:15.682 --> 01:17.818
Please sir, they're going to kill me.

01:18.586 --> 01:19.650
Okay, okay.

01:19.652 --> 01:21.488
Thank you, thank you.

01:24.592 --> 01:25.891
Wait.

01:25.893 --> 01:27.962
What's going on?

01:31.664 --> 01:32.966
Who is that?

01:38.705 --> 01:39.905
Just follow my lead.

01:39.907 --> 01:41.976
It will be all right.

02:13.973 --> 02:15.773
I'm Senior Stormleader Gebhardt.

02:15.775 --> 02:17.878
This is Under Stormleader Fegelein.

02:19.245 --> 02:21.148
What is this about?

02:22.515 --> 02:25.583
We are pursuing an enemy of the state.

02:25.585 --> 02:28.854
We have reason to believe he
may have entered your home.

02:28.856 --> 02:30.522
I'm afraid not.

02:30.524 --> 02:32.559
We haven't had any visitors tonight.

02:33.661 --> 02:35.226
What's your name?

02:35.228 --> 02:38.829
I'm Christophe Muller.
This is my wife, Brigitte.

02:38.831 --> 02:42.267
Is it just the two of you
in the house this evening?

02:42.269 --> 02:44.539
My daughter Esther is asleep upstairs.

02:48.675 --> 02:51.645
We would like to conduct
a search of the premises.

02:53.813 --> 02:55.547
Are there any objections?

02:55.549 --> 02:56.884
No.

02:57.717 --> 02:59.517
Sir, may I go upstairs

02:59.519 --> 03:01.721
and bring my daughter down to join us?

03:02.889 --> 03:04.655
She will be frightened

03:04.657 --> 03:06.993
if you enter her room without warning.

03:29.316 --> 03:30.952
You have two minutes.

03:40.426 --> 03:43.698
May I ask you what crime the man
you are looking for has committed?

03:46.532 --> 03:50.637
The man is considered a
threat to national security.

03:53.573 --> 03:55.406
Are you a supporter of the Fuehrer?

03:55.408 --> 03:56.808
Of course.

03:56.810 --> 03:59.344
Then you should want to
see the fugitive captured

03:59.346 --> 04:01.148
as soon as possible.

04:01.414 --> 04:02.817
I do.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.098
It's okay, sweetheart.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.501
These men need to look at the house

04:23.503 --> 04:24.938
to be sure of our safety.

04:29.910 --> 04:32.376
Now, before we begin,

04:32.378 --> 04:34.713
is there anything you wish to tell us

04:34.715 --> 04:38.083
that would make conducting
of a search unnecessary?

04:38.085 --> 04:40.384
I don't have any information.

04:40.386 --> 04:42.353
We live a very quiet life here.

04:42.355 --> 04:43.890
We're not used to this.

04:45.092 --> 04:47.928
If you cooperate you have nothing to fear.

04:50.097 --> 04:51.966
Fegelein, you search upstairs.

04:52.366 --> 04:53.801
Yes, sir.

05:25.032 --> 05:26.334
Nothing.

05:27.967 --> 05:29.533
It's clear.

05:29.535 --> 05:31.371
We thank you for your cooperation.

05:32.905 --> 05:34.275
Hold on.

05:34.975 --> 05:36.141
What?

05:36.143 --> 05:37.912
Did you check in there?

05:40.914 --> 05:42.350
No.

06:39.773 --> 06:41.241
Nothing of interest.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.244
Okay, let's go.

06:46.246 --> 06:47.782
Good night.

06:48.047 --> 06:50.250
Good night, officers.

07:10.837 --> 07:12.339
Hello?

07:18.277 --> 07:19.544
Have they gone?

07:19.546 --> 07:22.049
Yeah, you're safe.

07:34.727 --> 07:38.263
I am sorry we can't offer
you something more hospitable.

07:38.265 --> 07:41.368
But it's better you be hidden
should the officers return.

07:43.804 --> 07:45.636
Thank you, Christophe.

07:45.638 --> 07:48.273
I owe you a huge debt of gratitude.

07:48.275 --> 07:51.145
I'm happy to offer you temporary shelter.

07:52.112 --> 07:54.179
But my family will be
in danger if your stay

07:54.181 --> 07:56.250
becomes a long-term arrangement.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.016
Of course.

07:58.018 --> 08:00.187
Just a few days would be appreciated.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.987
I have friends on the east side of Bavaria.

08:02.989 --> 08:05.291
I'll head to them once
the search dies down.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.161
Good.

08:07.727 --> 08:09.295
Can I ask you something?

08:10.030 --> 08:11.365
Of course.

08:14.967 --> 08:16.134
The book.

08:16.136 --> 08:18.772
You haven't let it go since you arrived.

08:20.874 --> 08:22.543
What is the meaning of it?

08:24.076 --> 08:26.143
If I don't tell you,

08:26.145 --> 08:28.248
then you don't have to
lie when they ask you.

08:29.749 --> 08:32.183
But I assure you, I am no criminal.

08:32.184 --> 08:35.456
I pose no threat to you, or
your family, or anyone else.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.892
I was a historian by trade.

08:41.894 --> 08:44.430
Doing research for the Fuehrer.

08:45.766 --> 08:47.098
But I uncovered some dark secrets

08:47.100 --> 08:48.799
about the Fuehrer's plans for our country,

08:48.801 --> 08:51.505
and I felt it was my
duty to step and stop it.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.640
I understand.

08:55.642 --> 08:58.577
I don't support the current regime.

08:58.579 --> 09:02.383
Although I will not voice
that openly, of course.

09:03.783 --> 09:05.116
Indeed.

09:05.118 --> 09:07.919
We will provide you with food and shelter.

09:07.921 --> 09:11.091
All I expect in return
is respect for my family.

09:12.258 --> 09:13.961
Yes, of course.

09:14.927 --> 09:16.362
Thank you.

10:29.235 --> 10:30.938
Here you go, my love.

10:32.672 --> 10:34.974
Thank you, sweetheart.

10:38.845 --> 10:41.780
I like seeing sweat on
a working man's forehead.

10:41.782 --> 10:43.683
Oh, do you now?

10:51.391 --> 10:52.490
Christophe!

10:52.492 --> 10:53.824
Christophe.

10:53.826 --> 10:55.228
What is it?

10:55.696 --> 10:57.398
Christophe, look.

11:04.805 --> 11:06.340
They know he's here.

11:15.481 --> 11:17.115
Make sure Benjamin
returns to the attic, okay?

11:17.117 --> 11:18.282
Okay.

11:18.284 --> 11:20.184
Tell Esther we have visitors.

11:20.186 --> 11:21.218
Okay.

11:21.220 --> 11:22.990
It will be all right.

11:39.439 --> 11:40.804
The book!

11:40.806 --> 11:42.806
- I need the book!
- There's no time.

11:42.808 --> 11:45.511
Hide it. Whatever you do,
don't let them find it.

11:57.923 --> 11:59.392
Herr Muller.

11:59.759 --> 12:01.294
Yes?

12:02.128 --> 12:04.996
I am Colonel Ludolf von Alvensleben.

12:04.998 --> 12:07.101
How are you on this glorious day?

12:10.070 --> 12:12.072
Fine, thank you.

12:12.538 --> 12:13.671
Good.

12:13.673 --> 12:16.974
Uh, you may have guessed the
reason for my visit today.

12:16.976 --> 12:20.011
It's regarding the matter my officers
discussed with you a few days ago.

12:20.013 --> 12:21.913
They inspected my home.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.414
I'm aware of that.

12:23.416 --> 12:26.984
Forgive me, I hate to
trouble your family again,

12:26.986 --> 12:29.154
but it would be remiss
of me not to follow up

12:29.156 --> 12:31.322
on such an important
matter of national security.

12:31.324 --> 12:33.060
You understand, don't you?

12:33.325 --> 12:34.391
Of course.

12:34.393 --> 12:35.993
Good.

12:35.995 --> 12:37.563
May we go in for a moment?

12:38.498 --> 12:40.366
Yes, please.

12:58.350 --> 13:01.586
Ah, this must be your lovely wife.

13:01.588 --> 13:04.291
Yes, this is Brigitte.

13:04.891 --> 13:06.726
Frau Muller, a great pleasure.

13:09.428 --> 13:12.329
Would you like a drink?

13:12.331 --> 13:14.966
No thank you, I do not want to take up

13:14.968 --> 13:16.400
too much of your time.

13:16.402 --> 13:18.402
Though I'd love to meet
your lovely daughter,

13:18.404 --> 13:20.003
she's at home today?

13:20.005 --> 13:22.506
Uh, yes, she's upstairs in her bedroom.

13:22.508 --> 13:26.079
Excellent, perhaps I'll get
a chance to meet her later.

13:26.613 --> 13:27.645
Herr Muller...

13:27.647 --> 13:29.616
Please, call me Christophe.

13:30.182 --> 13:32.151
Very well, Christophe.

13:33.619 --> 13:35.389
May we speak privately?

13:36.255 --> 13:38.224
Yes, of course.

13:41.027 --> 13:42.359
I'll accompany her.

13:42.361 --> 13:44.163
Thank you, Fegelein.

13:49.569 --> 13:51.138
Please.

13:51.671 --> 13:53.273
Sit.

13:57.643 --> 13:59.243
Ahh.

13:59.245 --> 14:02.881
We are both busy men, so I'll
get straight to the point.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.649
The enemy of the state we are looking for

14:04.651 --> 14:07.517
is a man by the name of Benjamin Hoffman.

14:07.519 --> 14:10.121
He has stolen important
government documents which,

14:10.123 --> 14:11.655
if they fell into the hands of our enemies,

14:11.657 --> 14:14.794
would have grave consequences
for our national security.

14:15.961 --> 14:17.295
It is our understanding that Hoffman

14:17.297 --> 14:21.466
is intent on selling these
documents to a rival nation.

14:21.468 --> 14:24.404
I'm sure you understand it
is imperative we prevent it.

14:25.471 --> 14:26.538
Of course.

14:26.540 --> 14:29.439
I assume of course you
are loyal to the Fuehrer.

14:29.441 --> 14:31.675
I'm a very proud German.

14:31.677 --> 14:34.112
Of course you are.

14:34.114 --> 14:37.417
So, if you are to encounter this man,

14:38.284 --> 14:41.118
it would be your duty
as a proud German citizen

14:41.120 --> 14:44.021
to inform the authorities, yes?

14:44.023 --> 14:45.358
Of course.

14:50.129 --> 14:53.430
Do you know what exactly what
it is I do for the Fuehrer?

14:53.432 --> 14:54.800
No.

14:56.335 --> 14:59.405
Well, here in the Bavaria region,

15:00.306 --> 15:03.473
I am responsible for, amongst other things,

15:03.475 --> 15:06.611
finding and interrogating people

15:06.613 --> 15:09.683
suspected of harboring
enemies of the state.

15:11.518 --> 15:14.285
Do you know why I was
appointed to such a position?

15:14.287 --> 15:15.588
No.

15:16.989 --> 15:19.156
It is because unlike
the average human being,

15:19.158 --> 15:22.462
I do not treat lying
as an emotional matter.

15:23.463 --> 15:27.165
You see, lying is a science.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.333
And it's a very complex science.

15:29.335 --> 15:31.001
There are many different signals

15:31.003 --> 15:33.506
to tell if someone is lying.

15:34.206 --> 15:36.440
There are some people who can learn

15:36.442 --> 15:38.443
to control the overt symptoms,

15:38.445 --> 15:42.616
but there are some things
that we as human beings

15:43.450 --> 15:45.650
simply cannot control.

15:45.652 --> 15:49.289
Namely, the nervous system.

15:52.392 --> 15:55.626
When you are in a stressful situation,

15:55.628 --> 15:58.899
your autonomic and limbic systems react.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.467
Now this means that your whole body

16:02.469 --> 16:04.438
prepares you for the imminent threat.

16:05.004 --> 16:07.204
Your blood vessels constrict,

16:07.206 --> 16:08.606
you begin to breath faster,

16:08.608 --> 16:10.708
your heart beats more rapidly.

16:10.710 --> 16:13.211
This leads to sweating.

16:13.213 --> 16:16.546
Now, as the adrenaline
shoots through the body

16:16.548 --> 16:19.717
it is very difficult to
prevent the inevitable trembling

16:19.719 --> 16:24.591
in various body parts such
as your hands and feet.

16:27.826 --> 16:29.529
In this war,

16:30.629 --> 16:34.467
the most useful weapon is not a pistol.

16:37.070 --> 16:38.839
It is the nervous system.

16:42.108 --> 16:44.311
It tells me everything I need to know.

16:45.811 --> 16:48.078
I understand.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.247
What do you understand, Herr Muller?

16:50.249 --> 16:52.519
You are a human lie detector.

16:55.388 --> 16:59.656
Ha, that's something of
an over-simplification,

16:59.658 --> 17:03.396
but certainly an accurate sentiment.

17:05.432 --> 17:06.833
So,

17:07.199 --> 17:08.669
Christophe.

17:10.669 --> 17:13.306
Before we do one final search of your home,

17:14.607 --> 17:19.545
is there anything you'd
like to share with me?

17:20.146 --> 17:22.381
Any information you might have?

17:25.685 --> 17:27.788
I have no information.

17:34.627 --> 17:36.426
Of course.

17:36.428 --> 17:38.596
I would appreciate it if you and your wife

17:38.598 --> 17:41.866
would accompany me and my
men as we conduct our search.

17:41.868 --> 17:43.602
Of course.

18:12.331 --> 18:13.763
A bedroom?

18:13.765 --> 18:15.465
It's my daughter's.

18:15.467 --> 18:17.437
You will allow us to have a look?

18:32.385 --> 18:37.023
Esther, this is Colonel von Alvensleben.

18:38.390 --> 18:41.158
Please forgive her nervousness, Colonel.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.860
She's not used to visitors of such esteem.

18:43.862 --> 18:46.164
No need to be alarmed, young lady.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.968
I'm merely here to ensure
the safety of your family.

18:50.736 --> 18:52.538
She's a very beautiful girl.

19:05.984 --> 19:07.687
You play cards?

19:07.820 --> 19:09.156
Sometimes.

19:09.789 --> 19:11.655
Hmm.

19:11.657 --> 19:14.392
- Do you know poker?
- No.

19:14.394 --> 19:17.497
Well, this is a very interesting game.

19:19.331 --> 19:21.834
A key part of it is bluffing.

19:22.734 --> 19:24.470
You know what bluffing is?

19:24.803 --> 19:26.505
No.

19:26.673 --> 19:27.805
Hmm.

19:27.807 --> 19:31.545
Bluffing is an act of deception

19:34.680 --> 19:36.547
designed to make your weak hand

19:36.549 --> 19:38.150
look stronger than it is.

19:39.586 --> 19:42.019
And to get your opponent to fold.

19:42.021 --> 19:44.190
That means to lay down his hand.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.828
But you knew that already.

19:48.927 --> 19:50.663
She's very smart.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.970
Do you know what might
make a successful bluff?

19:58.705 --> 20:00.437
No.

20:00.439 --> 20:03.776
Well, first you need to
chose your moments wisely.

20:04.644 --> 20:07.011
There are several key elements to consider.

20:07.013 --> 20:11.150
First, you need to pick the
right opponent to bluff against.

20:12.051 --> 20:13.717
You don't want to bluff against a man

20:13.719 --> 20:15.586
who will not lay down his hand,

20:15.588 --> 20:17.823
even when he knows you have him beat.

20:19.324 --> 20:22.659
Bluffing on a hand which
has a small chance of success

20:22.661 --> 20:24.861
is much easier to do.

20:24.863 --> 20:28.898
Next, you need to determine
the size of your bet.

20:28.900 --> 20:32.435
Now ideally, you want to bet
the least amount necessary

20:32.437 --> 20:34.805
to get your opponent to fold.

20:34.807 --> 20:38.709
However, and this is most important,

20:38.711 --> 20:41.044
you never want to bluff against a man

20:41.046 --> 20:43.516
who knows when you are bluffing.

20:45.584 --> 20:47.052
See your hand.

20:55.093 --> 20:58.198
If your opponent can read your signals

21:00.366 --> 21:01.801
you will lose.

21:06.371 --> 21:09.339
The truth is, novice players

21:09.341 --> 21:12.312
fall into the trap of
bluffing far too often.

21:16.515 --> 21:18.549
I would suggest as a new player,

21:18.551 --> 21:20.853
avoiding the temptation to bluff at all.

21:21.654 --> 21:23.553
It is best to play a straight hand,

21:23.555 --> 21:25.891
and let fate decide your outcome.

21:26.892 --> 21:28.727
What do you think, Christophe?

21:30.029 --> 21:31.861
I'm sure you're a very formidable opponent

21:31.863 --> 21:34.033
at the poker table, Colonel.

21:42.875 --> 21:44.040
Your parents are going to show me

21:44.042 --> 21:45.879
the rest of the house now.

21:46.678 --> 21:48.678
Before they do,

21:48.680 --> 21:50.983
is there anything you'd
like to share with me?

21:52.685 --> 21:54.120
What about?

21:56.723 --> 22:00.659
Have you seen any house-guests
over the last few days?

22:03.596 --> 22:04.965
Yes.

22:12.705 --> 22:14.040
Who?

22:15.841 --> 22:18.178
My friend Sandra was here last week.

22:31.157 --> 22:32.726
How nice.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.832
Well, we will leave you
in peace for the moment.

22:41.934 --> 22:44.169
Thank you for allowing us to see your room.

22:45.772 --> 22:47.207
Christophe.

23:06.892 --> 23:08.827
Ah, your bedroom?

23:09.028 --> 23:10.697
Yes.

23:12.197 --> 23:13.732
May I?

23:14.533 --> 23:15.834
Of course.

23:27.045 --> 23:28.881
This is a magnificent house.

23:29.682 --> 23:30.984
Thank you.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.533
You're a very rich man, Christophe.

23:50.535 --> 23:53.537
- I'm afraid not.
- Oh, but you are.

23:53.539 --> 23:56.242
Every day you are
surrounded by such beauty.

23:56.708 --> 23:58.310
This is to be treasured.

23:59.044 --> 24:01.678
The beauty of nature,

24:01.680 --> 24:05.317
of your wife and daughter.

24:06.284 --> 24:07.920
And this house.

24:09.254 --> 24:12.057
This makes you a very rich man in my book.

24:12.692 --> 24:14.260
I suppose you're right.

24:27.205 --> 24:28.842
It is a shame.

24:30.109 --> 24:32.178
You are also a very foolish man.

24:45.190 --> 24:49.792
A fool is a man who does
not know how to fold,

24:49.794 --> 24:52.364
even when he knows you have him beat.

24:53.899 --> 24:56.299
But you knew that already.

24:56.301 --> 25:01.040
They say a fool is not merely
a man who does foolish things.

25:25.363 --> 25:27.065
Please...

25:42.915 --> 25:44.516
Ahh.

25:46.351 --> 25:48.051
They say in a man's last moments

25:48.053 --> 25:50.222
we find out who he really is.

25:51.223 --> 25:55.895
Unfortunately, we must now
find out who you really are.

25:56.094 --> 25:57.863
Kill them both.

27:35.461 --> 27:38.294
We're closed. Please
come back in the morning.

27:38.296 --> 27:41.197
No, please, please I have to come in!

27:41.199 --> 27:43.602
Please, let me in!

27:52.778 --> 27:54.514
What has happened to you?

27:56.381 --> 27:58.116
My dear child.

28:01.253 --> 28:03.089
What is your name?

28:05.256 --> 28:08.060
- Esther.
- Esther?

28:09.494 --> 28:11.761
Just stay still.

28:11.763 --> 28:13.265
Don't move.

28:14.100 --> 28:17.201
I have to phone up, I will call for help.

28:17.203 --> 28:20.273
No, it's too late.

28:24.909 --> 28:29.515
This book, the Nazis are looking for it.

28:32.984 --> 28:34.519
It's...

28:41.127 --> 28:42.526
No.

28:42.528 --> 28:44.097
No.

28:54.173 --> 28:55.640
Dear God.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.982
Anyone who gives shelter

29:04.984 --> 29:09.853
to a fugitive by the name of Esther Muller

29:09.855 --> 29:13.726
may be considered an enemy of the Fuehrer.

29:15.494 --> 29:17.063
Those...

29:18.263 --> 29:20.733
...who conceal information

29:21.332 --> 29:24.268
will be dealt with

29:24.270 --> 29:28.775
in the strongest possible terms!

31:18.516 --> 31:20.517
Good morning, Abigail.

31:20.519 --> 31:22.152
Good morning, Amos.

31:22.154 --> 31:24.687
Still talking to the dolls, I see?

31:24.689 --> 31:27.257
It may seem silly to some,

31:27.259 --> 31:30.126
but to me, they are my children.

31:30.128 --> 31:31.328
Yeah. It's understandable.

31:31.330 --> 31:33.262
You are their creator.

31:33.264 --> 31:34.699
I am indeed.

31:48.013 --> 31:49.415
Amos?

31:51.015 --> 31:52.584
Amos.

31:54.352 --> 31:55.720
Amos!

31:56.054 --> 31:57.386
Amos!

31:57.388 --> 31:59.021
Oh, sorry.

31:59.023 --> 32:00.357
Something on your mind?

32:00.359 --> 32:02.291
Oh, no.

32:02.293 --> 32:04.796
There's always something
to think about, no?

32:07.265 --> 32:08.900
The financial problem?

32:10.569 --> 32:12.304
No.

32:12.370 --> 32:13.672
Not so much.

32:20.779 --> 32:23.046
I will never understand why
you didn't leave the country

32:23.048 --> 32:25.682
with your sister when
you had the chance to.

32:25.684 --> 32:29.653
This business has been in the
family for many, many years.

32:29.655 --> 32:31.053
You know this.

32:31.055 --> 32:32.222
Yeah, I know.

32:32.224 --> 32:35.192
But business isn't doing great, Amos.

32:35.194 --> 32:37.763
To be honest, it's not even doing average.

32:42.201 --> 32:43.669
I know.

32:45.704 --> 32:48.440
Well, this shop...

32:49.207 --> 32:52.309
It sells the finest toys in Bavaria.

32:52.311 --> 32:54.543
And that must count for something.

32:54.545 --> 32:57.916
Yes, but people aren't
coming in to buy them.

33:01.619 --> 33:03.322
Do you know?

33:03.821 --> 33:06.525
My father, listen to me.

33:07.091 --> 33:10.295
My father used to say, "Amos,

33:11.362 --> 33:15.365
"don't let commerce become
more important than the art.

33:15.367 --> 33:17.533
"Because it's art that feeds the soul."

33:17.535 --> 33:20.537
Yes, not the money, I know.

33:22.107 --> 33:25.642
And artistry is very noble, Amos.

33:25.644 --> 33:29.982
But look, you can barely afford to pay me.

33:33.685 --> 33:35.353
I...

33:38.389 --> 33:40.490
To be honest, I...

33:40.492 --> 33:43.295
I don't think I'm going to
be able to stay much longer.

33:46.165 --> 33:47.566
Oh, my sweet.

33:47.765 --> 33:49.701
My sweet child.

33:51.469 --> 33:54.703
Look, you just give me a few more weeks.

33:54.705 --> 33:57.307
And I will find a solution.

33:57.309 --> 33:58.607
Okay?

33:58.609 --> 34:00.313
Okay.

34:02.313 --> 34:04.816
But that's what you said last month.

34:12.558 --> 34:14.357
Look, look.

34:14.359 --> 34:16.996
Things are looking up already.

34:17.763 --> 34:19.596
Morning, sir.

34:19.598 --> 34:22.601
Please, come in, good morning.

34:23.435 --> 34:26.438
I see you like the doll house, eh?

34:27.473 --> 34:29.905
This is one of my favorites, too.

34:29.907 --> 34:33.342
Tiny windows to another world.

34:33.344 --> 34:36.981
A safe world, full of fun and imagination.

34:50.194 --> 34:52.529
I'm gonna go home for
the day if that's okay.

34:52.531 --> 34:54.833
And do you need anything from the shop?

34:55.333 --> 34:57.869
No no, I'll be fine.

34:59.237 --> 35:01.637
You be careful out there tonight, okay?

35:01.639 --> 35:04.306
Yeah, you too, don't stay up too late.

35:04.308 --> 35:05.675
See you tomorrow.

35:05.677 --> 35:07.813
Good night, Abigail.

35:37.208 --> 35:38.977
My oh my.

35:56.828 --> 35:59.195
Several of us searched the Muller house.

35:59.197 --> 36:03.300
No sign of the book, the girl
must have taken it with her.

36:03.302 --> 36:07.503
I made inquiries with several residents
in the nearby village this morning.

36:07.505 --> 36:11.110
No one has provided any useful information.

36:13.344 --> 36:14.911
In a small town everyone keeps track

36:14.913 --> 36:17.346
of what their neighbors are doing.

36:17.348 --> 36:21.686
Someone in Rosenheim
knows where the girl is.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.987
Someone is harboring her.

36:24.989 --> 36:28.023
Please, return to the village immediately,

36:28.025 --> 36:30.393
begin questioning the villagers.

36:30.395 --> 36:32.997
If information is not forthcoming, then...

36:34.333 --> 36:37.570
I'm afraid more persuasive
tactics will be necessary.

36:38.036 --> 36:39.872
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

37:53.078 --> 37:55.113
What was I thinking?

38:23.674 --> 38:25.177
Robert,

38:26.777 --> 38:29.113
you're really alive?

38:31.882 --> 38:33.985
You look wonderful.

38:34.552 --> 38:37.856
Absolutely wonderful.

38:51.369 --> 38:53.372
Why, you look a little happier today.

38:54.373 --> 38:55.707
Indeed.

38:56.407 --> 38:59.611
I've made a wonderful discovery.

39:04.616 --> 39:06.051
See that doll?

39:07.719 --> 39:08.751
The ugly one.

39:08.753 --> 39:10.289
Don't say that.

39:10.788 --> 39:12.991
You will hurt his feelings.

39:13.625 --> 39:15.193
Okay.

39:16.460 --> 39:17.896
This is Robert.

39:24.201 --> 39:26.738
Now, what I'm about to tell you,

39:27.739 --> 39:30.672
it must never leave the shop.

39:30.674 --> 39:33.811
You understand, it stays between us, okay?

39:33.878 --> 39:35.677
Of course.

39:35.679 --> 39:37.148
Good.

39:39.451 --> 39:43.219
The other night, a girl came to the shop,

39:43.221 --> 39:46.659
and she left a book with me and then fled.

39:47.426 --> 39:48.794
A book?

39:49.627 --> 39:50.996
Yes.

39:51.462 --> 39:53.031
A book.

39:57.235 --> 39:59.238
The Nazis are looking for it.

40:00.438 --> 40:01.603
Why did she give it to you?

40:01.605 --> 40:04.773
I don't know. I really don't.

40:04.775 --> 40:07.009
But when I looked inside the book,

40:07.011 --> 40:09.078
it's pages were full of spells.

40:09.080 --> 40:12.681
Some I didn't understand, but one spell,

40:12.683 --> 40:16.788
a spell that brings life to the inanimate.

40:18.924 --> 40:20.790
Are you feeling all right today, Amos?

40:20.792 --> 40:22.227
Indeed.

40:22.726 --> 40:24.527
Indeed I am.

40:24.529 --> 40:27.663
Because now I can truly
bring these creations to life.

40:27.665 --> 40:29.400
Come on, Amos, no.

40:30.601 --> 40:32.037
See for yourself.

40:34.906 --> 40:36.341
Robert.

40:38.543 --> 40:40.145
Show Abigail.

40:43.815 --> 40:45.918
Come on, Robert.

40:46.951 --> 40:49.153
Show Abigail you're alive.

40:50.755 --> 40:52.858
Perhaps he's a little shy.

40:56.560 --> 41:00.198
He's not shy, no.

41:03.835 --> 41:05.701
I don't understand it.

41:05.703 --> 41:08.871
He was running about last night.

41:08.873 --> 41:10.739
Come on, you should rest today.

41:10.741 --> 41:11.808
I'll make you a drink.

41:11.810 --> 41:12.909
I don't want a drink.

41:12.911 --> 41:13.976
It's okay.

41:13.978 --> 41:15.744
You will show me later, come on.

41:15.746 --> 41:17.045
Please.

41:17.047 --> 41:18.547
Something's gone wrong.

41:18.549 --> 41:19.851
Yes.

41:30.694 --> 41:32.463
I hope you have good news.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.101
I'm afraid not, sir.

41:38.103 --> 41:41.073
We've questioned over a
dozen people in the village.

41:41.772 --> 41:44.942
The trail is still cold.

42:17.042 --> 42:19.909
I have a meeting with
the Fuehrer in a few days.

42:19.911 --> 42:21.643
How do you think he's going to react

42:21.645 --> 42:24.248
when I tell him we've been
outwitted by a bunch of...

42:40.297 --> 42:42.967
We need a change of tactics.

42:44.703 --> 42:47.372
Rosenheim is a poor village.

42:49.206 --> 42:51.543
We need something they will respond to.

42:53.877 --> 42:55.380
What's that, sir?

42:59.417 --> 43:03.786
We will offer a very handsome reward

43:03.788 --> 43:07.724
and a guarantee of no further harassment

43:07.726 --> 43:09.692
to anyone with information

43:09.694 --> 43:12.264
leading to the capture of the book.

43:14.398 --> 43:17.032
But do you think this
will have more impact, sir?

43:17.034 --> 43:19.271
Is fear not the ultimate persuasion?

43:31.782 --> 43:35.117
Hope has its place too, Fegelein.

43:35.119 --> 43:38.956
Twenty thousand Deutschmarks would
change the life of any poor man.

43:41.092 --> 43:43.125
But there is no way all of the villagers

43:43.127 --> 43:45.897
will harbor someone worth so much.

43:49.868 --> 43:53.670
Put the word out immediately.
20,000 for information

43:53.672 --> 43:55.607
leading to the capture of Esther Muller.

43:57.042 --> 43:58.510
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

44:58.136 --> 44:59.537
Hello?

46:19.350 --> 46:21.253
Amos!

46:23.253 --> 46:25.724
Stop that right now!

46:27.859 --> 46:29.625
This is Abigail.

46:29.627 --> 46:31.960
She is a friend, do you understand?

46:38.869 --> 46:40.338
Do you?

46:45.442 --> 46:48.145
Now give me that pencil.

46:54.284 --> 46:56.085
Look what you've done to her.

46:56.087 --> 46:57.555
Naughty boy!

47:05.096 --> 47:06.531
Oh, my dear.

47:06.998 --> 47:08.700
Come, come.

47:09.234 --> 47:10.769
It's all right.

47:11.969 --> 47:13.737
It's all right, my child.

47:20.578 --> 47:23.347
When you first told me about that book,

47:24.147 --> 47:26.417
I thought you were losing your mind.

47:31.956 --> 47:33.355
Now you know I'm not.

47:33.357 --> 47:35.659
But why did he want to hurt me?

47:36.159 --> 47:37.960
I don't know.

47:37.962 --> 47:40.295
I've been trying to work it out, Abigail.

47:40.297 --> 47:42.364
Do you know, I'm thinking that maybe

47:42.366 --> 47:45.467
it's something to do with the
source of the doll's parts.

47:45.469 --> 47:47.505
I thought you made him from scratch.

47:48.306 --> 47:49.774
No, no.

47:50.507 --> 47:52.007
Not Robert.

47:52.009 --> 47:55.277
He and the other dolls, Otto and Isabella,

47:55.279 --> 47:57.112
I sourced their parts from different places

47:57.114 --> 47:59.750
and assembled them right
here in the workshop.

48:01.618 --> 48:04.987
No, I first discovered Robert

48:04.989 --> 48:08.693
after reading in the newspapers
that a young boy had died.

48:10.060 --> 48:14.665
His body was found in a
local park, clutching a doll.

48:16.333 --> 48:19.470
Turned out that the boy's
father had killed him.

48:20.705 --> 48:23.139
God, that's horrible.

48:23.141 --> 48:25.310
Indeed, indeed.

48:26.710 --> 48:30.748
After the case was closed,
I purchased the doll.

48:33.150 --> 48:36.755
I remodeled his face,
I reinforced the limbs.

48:37.654 --> 48:39.757
I named him Robert.

48:40.991 --> 48:42.793
After the boy who had died.

48:43.962 --> 48:46.430
Why did you want such a morbid thing?

48:47.130 --> 48:49.431
You can call me an old fool,

48:49.433 --> 48:54.438
but I felt as if the boy's
soul had entered the doll.

48:56.340 --> 49:01.177
I felt that his soul would be in torment.

49:01.179 --> 49:05.146
So I brought him here to a
secure home, filled with toys.

49:05.148 --> 49:08.351
I thought a place full
of childhood innocence

49:08.353 --> 49:11.786
would allow his soul to
live in peace, you know.

49:11.788 --> 49:13.521
Okay, that thing

49:13.523 --> 49:16.692
did not seem like a soul
at peace to me, Amos.

49:16.694 --> 49:19.597
Okay? This is dangerous.

49:21.465 --> 49:24.769
Perhaps anger still remains
about the way the boy died.

49:30.808 --> 49:35.347
Look, I'm sorry but I
can't keep working here.

49:38.116 --> 49:39.584
Please...

49:41.118 --> 49:43.485
Please don't go, Abigail.

49:43.487 --> 49:46.221
I can't put myself in
danger like this anymore.

49:46.223 --> 49:49.693
I'm sorry, but today will be my last day.

49:55.632 --> 49:57.369
This is terrible.

49:58.536 --> 50:02.474
Of course I will be very sad to see you go.

50:04.174 --> 50:05.843
I will be sad, too.

51:03.167 --> 51:05.336
Abigail was like family to me.

51:06.871 --> 51:08.606
She really was.

51:16.714 --> 51:19.215
But now she's gone,

51:19.217 --> 51:22.486
perhaps it is time to
create a family of our own.

51:26.190 --> 51:29.961
Robert. This is it.

51:31.194 --> 51:35.099
We are about to become a real family.

52:16.773 --> 52:18.943
Oh, my!

52:22.246 --> 52:24.682
Robert, it's worked.

52:25.482 --> 52:27.551
It's really worked.

52:31.255 --> 52:34.692
Oh, Otto, Isabel.

52:46.904 --> 52:48.670
Good news, sir.

52:48.672 --> 52:51.340
We have an informant
waiting in the hallway.

52:51.342 --> 52:53.511
She's interested in the reward.

52:54.978 --> 52:56.878
Is the information genuine?

52:56.880 --> 52:58.413
I don't know yet.

52:58.415 --> 53:00.984
She wanted to talk to
someone in a senior position.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.688
Well let's hope so Gebhardt.

53:05.690 --> 53:07.422
I'm tired of dealing
with these lying idiots

53:07.424 --> 53:08.959
trying to claim the reward.

53:09.726 --> 53:11.162
Please, bring her in.

53:17.034 --> 53:20.972
So, you know for a fact this

53:22.038 --> 53:25.040
Amos Blackwood has the book?

53:25.042 --> 53:29.981
Yes, he told me that a girl
named Esther gave it to him.

53:31.715 --> 53:33.514
But you didn't actually see it.

53:33.516 --> 53:35.583
No.

53:35.585 --> 53:39.554
So how do you know Herr Blackwood
is not some senile old fool?

53:39.556 --> 53:41.824
Because he's been using the book.

53:41.826 --> 53:45.863
One toy in the shop, it
came to life and attacked me.

53:46.897 --> 53:48.832
It did, it did.

53:51.268 --> 53:55.337
Fraulein Kendrick, where
in the shop do you think

53:55.339 --> 53:57.642
Herr Blackwood would keep the book?

53:58.743 --> 54:05.514
Well, he has living
quarters above the shop.

54:05.516 --> 54:07.882
And there is a workshop in the back room.

54:07.884 --> 54:12.856
So I would say either one of
those places are a safe bet.

54:14.424 --> 54:15.757
Excellent.

54:15.759 --> 54:18.662
Thank you Fraulein,
you've been most helpful.

54:21.531 --> 54:23.065
So when do I get paid?

54:23.067 --> 54:24.366
Paid?

54:24.368 --> 54:26.169
Yes, the reward.

54:26.904 --> 54:28.673
Yes, of course.

54:28.973 --> 54:31.709
Gebhardt, please pay her.

54:41.451 --> 54:42.518
How much?

54:42.520 --> 54:44.055
Well, all of it.

54:45.822 --> 54:47.157
All of it.

54:52.096 --> 54:53.929
Tell me, Fraulein.

54:53.931 --> 54:56.931
Have you ever heard of
the correlation in behavior

54:56.933 --> 54:59.703
between humans and rats?

55:02.940 --> 55:05.541
I don't understand.

55:05.543 --> 55:10.445
Surprisingly, humans and rats are actually
more alike than they are different.

55:10.447 --> 55:15.784
For one thing, we are both
warm blooded and mammals.

55:15.786 --> 55:19.987
Rats eat everything we do,
and they live where we live.

55:19.989 --> 55:23.594
But you know what the most
amazing similarities are?

55:24.494 --> 55:25.863
No.

55:26.697 --> 55:30.735
Rats form social groups.

55:32.069 --> 55:36.137
And they exhibit many of
the same behaviors as humans.

55:36.139 --> 55:39.811
Also, this is my favorite part,

55:40.677 --> 55:43.814
rats have culture.

55:45.549 --> 55:49.053
Cultured rats, it's amazing, <i>ja?</i>

55:50.888 --> 55:55.190
Sadly, rats also exhibit many of the same

55:55.192 --> 55:57.860
negative behaviors as humans.

55:57.862 --> 56:01.496
For instance, when faced
with overpopulation,

56:01.498 --> 56:05.166
rats turn extremely violent.

56:05.168 --> 56:09.570
This is one of the sadder
aspects of the rat race, hmm?

56:09.572 --> 56:12.309
But you know what the real
trouble with the rat race is?

56:13.911 --> 56:16.314
Even if you win the race...

56:18.014 --> 56:20.050
You are still a rat.

56:32.730 --> 56:34.666
Forgive me.

56:49.846 --> 56:51.349
Please,

56:52.215 --> 56:54.049
go to the toymaker's shop.

56:54.051 --> 56:59.221
Find the book, and bring
Herr Blackwood to me, alive.

56:59.223 --> 57:01.690
I need to know what he's
been doing with the book.

57:01.692 --> 57:03.827
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

57:05.529 --> 57:11.302
Ah, but before you do,
please call the cleaners.

57:40.063 --> 57:41.499
That noise.

57:43.801 --> 57:45.202
Was it you?

57:50.574 --> 57:52.510
You all stay there.

58:08.292 --> 58:10.360
The old fucker's in the car boot.

58:10.594 --> 58:11.793
There we go.

58:11.795 --> 58:14.596
Burn that shit-hole to the ground.

58:14.598 --> 58:17.034
Then we meet later on in headquarters.

58:17.868 --> 58:19.202
Okay.

58:28.878 --> 58:31.079
Meet me at the headquarters?

58:31.081 --> 58:33.184
Fuck you, Gebhardt.

58:59.043 --> 59:01.345
Where are my matches?

59:48.958 --> 59:50.427
Herr Blackwood.

59:57.301 --> 01:00:01.037
Ah, forgive my delay.

01:00:01.739 --> 01:00:04.271
I had several hours worth

01:00:04.273 --> 01:00:07.211
of very important
appointments to attend to.

01:00:09.246 --> 01:00:11.415
Where have you brought me?

01:00:11.982 --> 01:00:13.617
Where am I?

01:00:14.418 --> 01:00:17.053
That is of minor importance right now.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.822
What is of major importance is who I am.

01:00:21.824 --> 01:00:23.894
And what you can do for me.

01:00:25.094 --> 01:00:26.563
Who are you?

01:00:29.065 --> 01:00:32.035
Right now, to you?

01:00:35.672 --> 01:00:36.940
I am God.

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:43.613
Whether you live or die
rests solely with me.

01:00:45.281 --> 01:00:47.417
So I would act accordingly.

01:00:52.156 --> 01:00:55.459
Tell me, what do you want?

01:00:56.826 --> 01:00:59.563
I want to ask questions.

01:01:05.469 --> 01:01:09.106
If the answers are helpful, then the Lord,

01:01:09.772 --> 01:01:12.375
that's me, will giveth.

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.546
If the answers are vague then

01:01:17.514 --> 01:01:20.418
the Lord will not be so generous.

01:01:26.857 --> 01:01:28.325
Understand?

01:01:34.931 --> 01:01:36.967
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:01:42.806 --> 01:01:44.408
Esther Muller.

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:48.212
What do you know about her?

01:01:55.518 --> 01:01:57.451
Herr Blackwood, please.

01:01:57.453 --> 01:01:59.389
Esther Muller?

01:02:07.364 --> 01:02:09.400
This is no way to begin.

01:02:19.476 --> 01:02:22.079
We already know many things.

01:02:30.453 --> 01:02:35.458
I simply want to have a nice conversation.

01:02:42.132 --> 01:02:43.467
So.

01:02:57.447 --> 01:02:59.116
Esther Muller.

01:03:09.359 --> 01:03:10.727
Very well.

01:03:12.161 --> 01:03:13.994
Allow me to elaborate.

01:03:17.234 --> 01:03:19.602
I'm not a big believer in violence.

01:03:21.038 --> 01:03:24.038
I prefer to use intellectual debate

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.576
and political discourse
to solve my problems.

01:03:28.612 --> 01:03:33.117
However, apparently you
don't understand these things.

01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:41.759
Unfortunately, violence
is the universal language.

01:03:43.627 --> 01:03:45.162
So.

01:03:48.331 --> 01:03:50.133
Esther Muller?

01:04:35.578 --> 01:04:37.145
What is the matter?

01:04:37.147 --> 01:04:39.346
Sir, I was looking for the Colonel.

01:04:39.348 --> 01:04:41.516
He's busy in the interrogation room!

01:04:41.518 --> 01:04:44.018
There has been a disturbance
in the dining area.

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.420
What kind of disturbance?

01:04:45.422 --> 01:04:48.123
The cutlery drawers are all over the floor.

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:51.293
Are you suggesting there
has been an intruder?

01:04:51.295 --> 01:04:54.665
No sir, I think it's most likely to
have been an incident with the cook.

01:04:55.264 --> 01:04:56.697
Incident?

01:04:56.699 --> 01:04:59.300
Yes, sir, he likes to drink,
and I imagine he has had

01:04:59.302 --> 01:05:01.436
one too many to drink last
night before he's gone home,

01:05:01.438 --> 01:05:02.704
and made a mess.

01:05:02.706 --> 01:05:04.139
Right.

01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:07.141
Go down to the dining
area and clean the mess up.

01:05:07.143 --> 01:05:10.712
Then contact the cook, and ask him to
report to me first thing in the morning,

01:05:10.714 --> 01:05:13.918
disciplinary action may be in order.

01:05:14.717 --> 01:05:16.452
Yes, sir.

01:05:37.507 --> 01:05:39.276
Please, Herr Blackwood.

01:05:41.011 --> 01:05:42.880
My hands are getting tired.

01:05:47.183 --> 01:05:48.785
I do not want to

01:05:51.188 --> 01:05:53.357
turn to other methods.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.688
Esther Muller.

01:06:29.493 --> 01:06:31.528
Esther Muller.

01:06:40.804 --> 01:06:43.337
She came to my shop!

01:06:43.339 --> 01:06:46.309
She came to my shop.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.779
She gave me the book.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.650
She gave me the book.

01:06:54.351 --> 01:06:55.853
That is all.

01:06:57.154 --> 01:06:58.520
Thank you, Herr Blackwood.

01:06:58.522 --> 01:07:00.855
You see, now we are getting somewhere.

01:07:00.857 --> 01:07:02.959
This is what I wanted to know.

01:07:31.455 --> 01:07:32.990
Hello?

01:07:38.895 --> 01:07:40.631
Hello?

01:09:53.029 --> 01:09:54.831
Tell me about the book.

01:09:57.234 --> 01:09:59.870
Do you understand its significance?

01:10:00.904 --> 01:10:03.371
No.

01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:08.644
I simply, I flipped through
a few pages, that is it.

01:10:09.678 --> 01:10:11.481
Don't know anything.

01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:15.786
Really.

01:10:16.852 --> 01:10:18.488
Don't.

01:10:23.459 --> 01:10:24.861
Very well.

01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:28.866
I will enlighten you.

01:10:31.868 --> 01:10:34.638
To me this book is a gift.

01:10:35.672 --> 01:10:39.540
However, in the wrong
hands, it could be a weapon.

01:10:39.542 --> 01:10:41.576
A very powerful weapon.

01:10:41.578 --> 01:10:45.345
The book was first written many years ago

01:10:45.347 --> 01:10:49.516
by a German scholar,
Joseph von Hammersmark.

01:10:49.518 --> 01:10:52.086
He spent many years studying ancient texts

01:10:52.088 --> 01:10:54.354
and mystical philosophies,

01:10:54.356 --> 01:10:57.860
in Egypt and Tibet.

01:11:00.864 --> 01:11:02.963
Of course, many of his contemporaries

01:11:02.965 --> 01:11:08.738
cast aspersions on his work,
but Himmler and the Fuehrer,

01:11:09.438 --> 01:11:11.541
they took a great interest in it.

01:11:14.377 --> 01:11:19.549
To them, this book could
be potentially as important

01:11:20.583 --> 01:11:22.219
as the Holy Grail.

01:11:22.384 --> 01:11:23.820
But why?

01:11:26.856 --> 01:11:28.959
Because it holds the key to life.

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.827
Eternal life.

01:11:32.829 --> 01:11:36.332
As well as many other important things,

01:11:37.499 --> 01:11:39.869
such as the gift of life

01:11:40.102 --> 01:11:42.572
for inanimate objects.

01:11:44.406 --> 01:11:46.843
Does this sound familiar, Herr Blackwood?

01:11:49.812 --> 01:11:51.180
No.

01:11:53.549 --> 01:11:55.151
It does not.

01:12:01.924 --> 01:12:03.123
This simply...

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:05.262
No, no no no.

01:12:09.132 --> 01:12:11.969
We were finally getting
somewhere, Herr Blackwood.

01:12:12.835 --> 01:12:18.605
You established Esther
had come to your shop.

01:12:18.607 --> 01:12:23.879
You had gotten the book
from here, <i>ja?</i>

01:12:25.382 --> 01:12:27.582
We were having an honest conversation,

01:12:27.584 --> 01:12:30.585
and then you retreat into deception again.

01:12:30.587 --> 01:12:32.255
This simply won't do.

01:12:39.695 --> 01:12:42.365
You are going to kill me, whatever I say.

01:12:43.031 --> 01:12:45.168
Aren't you?

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.342
Of course.

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:56.813
It's not a matter of if you will die.

01:13:01.183 --> 01:13:02.785
But how.

01:13:56.606 --> 01:13:59.242
What the hell is going on?

01:14:14.958 --> 01:14:16.727
Little bastard!

01:15:03.873 --> 01:15:09.079
Whatever you say next may get
chiseled onto a gravestone, so...

01:15:10.547 --> 01:15:13.849
I would suggest something...

01:15:15.584 --> 01:15:16.952
Poetic.

01:15:19.755 --> 01:15:22.092
Go fuck yourself,

01:15:22.558 --> 01:15:25.327
you son of a bitch.

01:15:37.039 --> 01:15:39.208
It's crude,

01:15:40.043 --> 01:15:44.281
yet poetic in its own way, I suppose.

01:15:46.782 --> 01:15:51.888
Your defiance is an admirable
quality, Herr Blackwood.

01:15:54.089 --> 01:15:55.892
And I envy you.

01:15:56.392 --> 01:15:58.792
You are about to discover

01:15:58.794 --> 01:16:00.963
what science never has.

01:16:01.697 --> 01:16:03.500
What exists beyond this world.

01:17:38.227 --> 01:17:40.563
Go ahead, kill me.

01:17:50.906 --> 01:17:52.942
Oh, my children.

01:17:54.477 --> 01:17:56.079
Isabel.

01:17:57.312 --> 01:17:58.948
Otto.

01:18:00.249 --> 01:18:01.618
Robert.

01:18:05.187 --> 01:18:08.124
I'm so very, very proud of you.

01:18:09.859 --> 01:18:12.728
You have all done so very, very well.

01:18:16.499 --> 01:18:19.736
But your father is not going to make it.

01:18:23.972 --> 01:18:26.508
But I want you to know

01:18:30.312 --> 01:18:32.115
you will

01:18:33.749 --> 01:18:38.721
always have each other.

01:20:27.996 --> 01:20:29.365
Shh!

01:20:35.504 --> 01:20:37.340
Be quiet in there.

01:20:38.106 --> 01:20:40.110
You're going to get us caught.

01:20:46.348 --> 01:20:49.419
Robert, stop pulling her hair.

01:20:50.218 --> 01:20:52.485
Don't worry, my children.

01:20:52.487 --> 01:20:54.488
As soon as we reach our destination,

01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:59.429
Papa will set you free.
Now be good in there.

01:21:19.181 --> 01:21:20.581
Here we go.

01:21:20.583 --> 01:21:22.751
Now be good, children.
