00:03.600 --> 00:06.080
We have to stop whoever's behind this
before someone else gets hurt.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.402
I think we're screwed.
The experiments were bad enough,

00:08.560 --> 00:11.609
but now that there are targets
on our backs, I don't know.

00:11.760 --> 00:14.843
My name's Julianna.
But I'm more interested in who you are

00:15.000 --> 00:16.764
and why you've been trying
to stop me.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.809
Because that's what we do,
stop people like you.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.371
In a city of 8 million people,

00:20.520 --> 00:23.330

by chance? I don't think so.

She did all this to stop somebody else?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.726
Hard to believe there's someone
out there that's worse than her.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.201
All I know is that
you're not loyal to me, J.T.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.681
I wanna be with someone

00:43.840 --> 00:45.763
who cares about what I need,
and that's not you.

00:45.920 --> 00:51.450
I wanna marry you, Vincent Keller,

01:12.760 --> 01:14.285
He's in prison.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.087
No, I specifically said orchids
at the altar, not peonies.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.242
Where do I go?
Like, should I be here or...?

01:19.400 --> 01:21.482
- There is fine, Heather.
- I'm Tess. This is Heather.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.244
Oh, sorry.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.844
Shouldn't we be at an angle
or something,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.446

01:28.600 --> 01:30.568
- Sure, if you like.
- It doesn't matter, right?

01:30.720 --> 01:33.485
No, this is not a misunderstanding.
It's a mistake. It's your mistake.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.444
- Oh, you look beautiful.
- I can't believe

01:36.600 --> 01:38.364
- this is actually happening.
- Me, neither.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.727
Will there be any more
bridesmaids or groomsmen?

- No, no, this is us.
- Flower girl? A ring bearer?

01:43.640 --> 01:46.246
- No, we're a pretty tight-knit group.
- Yeah, like family.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.686
Supposed to be.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.002
Okay, you know what?
The wedding starts at 11 tomorrow,

01:50.160 --> 01:52.766
so I expect orchids at the altar
by 9, you got it?

01:54.040 --> 01:58.011
- So, what's next?
- Uh, hold. Hold a minute.

He's a last-minute replacement.

But all that matters is that you're
finally getting married, right?

02:08.680 --> 02:11.047
Okay, okay. I gotta go over
foyer flowers with the bride,

02:11.200 --> 02:13.009
so we'll be right back.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.728
There was a minor hiccup with the
orchids, but don't worry about a thing.

Everything will be worked out, and
everything will be beautiful tomorrow.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.563
- What's up?
- Apparently Julianna just woke up

02:22.720 --> 02:24.085
- out of her coma.
J.T.: So?

02:24.240 --> 02:26.163
Not so loud.
We don't wanna worry Cat.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.563
Sorry, we didn't know that.
Besides, what's there to worry about?

02:29.720 --> 02:32.610
Julianna's behind all the superhuman
experiments. You caught her.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.444
Except she kept talking about
somebody else

02:34.600 --> 02:37.080
that she claimed she
was making the experiments to stop.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.969
But you said that
was her problem, not ours.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.691
I wanna make sure it's not ours,
especially before the wedding.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.366
- What are the chances?
- I don't know. I wanna talk to her.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.524
I don't want Cat to switch focus from
the wedding if she doesn't have to.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.001
Heather's taking her
to get ready for the rehearsal dinner.

- Okay. I'll get the car.

Vincent and I.

We gotta finish up the rehearsal.

We're still not telling anyone we
broke up until after the wedding, right?

But I still don't even know
why we broke up.

this entire ceremony.

You'll exchange vows,
and then you'll say your "I dos,"

"I now pronounce you man and wife.

to experiment on innocent people

I didn't, but I didn't have a choice,

- because somebody has to stop Liam.

all the power he's got.

he has to kill along the way,

- so she's got no idea.
- It won't be easy to keep this from her.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.650
- Frankly I'm not even sure we should.
- If we tell her Julianna escaped,

11:07.800 --> 11:10.371
- she'll call off the wedding.
- Tess is right. She will.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.284
Let's just think this through,
all right?

11:12.440 --> 11:14.966
All right, all that's happened so far
is Julianna escaped,

11:15.120 --> 11:17.248
and for all we know
it's just to avoid prosecution.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.688
Or there really is a Liam out there
and she's going after him.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.764
Yeah, but even if he does exist,
and we've found no evidence of that,

11:23.920 --> 11:26.924
it's still not a direct threat to us,
which means if you told Cat,

11:27.080 --> 11:28.844
she'd be cancelling the wedding
for no reason.

we keep this from Catherine?

11:31.880 --> 11:34.201
Yeah, I am.
At least until after the wedding.

10, 11 hours from now?

- Catherine is gonna kill rne

if she finds out about this
and it blows up in her face, right?

11:46.560 --> 11:49.450
But you're right, we're close, so...

11:50.720 --> 11:53.291
Okay, let's just find out
if Julianna really is on the run,

11:53.440 --> 11:57.570
- and if she's gonna hurt anyone else.
- Anybody like you, you mean?

11:57.720 --> 12:00.485
He told me she suggested
injecting him with the serum.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.688
Okay, so, then,
if it makes you feel any better,

12:02.840 --> 12:04.763

37:26.200 --> 37:28.771
lam. This whole thing is my fault.

37:28.920 --> 37:31.400
I don't care what Tess or J.T.
or Heather has to say.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.562
At the end of the day, it's on me.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.849
Catherine, I'm more sorry than
you could ever imagine, you know?

37:37.000 --> 37:40.721
I don't even know how you can
forgive rne on this one.

37:40.880 --> 37:44.805
For what? For loving me?
For wanting to marry me?

37:47.760 --> 37:52.163
- What a big mess, huh?
- Yeah, what a mess.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.805
Guess it's gonna be a while
before we can try again.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.843
That's if you do wanna try again.

38:01.720 --> 38:04.200
Oh, of course I do.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.488
I just think that
we should wait a little while.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.005
Ag reed.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.242
You know, I think first
we gotta stop Liam.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.970
- Vincent--
- No, Catherine, listen.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.600
I know it took me a while,
but I get what you meant now,

38:15.760 --> 38:18.525
about what you said about us
having a greater purpose.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.921
There are things
that we can't control.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.048
I have no idea what I was thinking,

38:23.200 --> 38:25.885
wanting us to get married
in the middle of all this.

38:26.040 --> 38:28.691
The stakes are too high.
We gotta stop this guy Liam first.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.320
Okay, we are not stopping Liam.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.528
We gotta. We gotta
at least try, Catherine.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.251
No, you don't understand.
lam done, Vincent.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.609
- I am not doing this anymore.
- What do you mean?

38:39.760 --> 38:42.923
I don't even know what I was thinking.
This is never-ending.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.003
It just keeps getting worse.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.485
Liam could've easily killed us today.

38:48.640 --> 38:52.964
So why are we going after him,
when he's not even coming after us?

38:53.120 --> 38:58.365
Why should we have to keep risking
our lives, our friends' lives, Heather's?

38:58.520 --> 39:02.684
Who says this has to be
our fight? It's not.

39:03.640 --> 39:04.971
It's over.

39:07.480 --> 39:08.606
I quit.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.324
Wait, come on...
