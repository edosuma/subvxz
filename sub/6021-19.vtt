WEBVTT

00:03.436 --> 00:05.700
-Tea with lemon.
-What happened to your voice?

00:05.872 --> 00:07.567
I was screaming at hecklers
all night.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.232
Last time I open for a rodeo.

00:10.977 --> 00:13.445
Well, Jerry, I've been thinking.

00:13.613 --> 00:17.071
I've gone as far as I can go
with George Costanza.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.411
Is this the suicide talk,
or the nickname talk?

00:19.586 --> 00:20.951
The nickname.

00:21.121 --> 00:24.420
"George." What is that?
It's nothing.

00:24.591 --> 00:27.389
It's got no snap. No zip.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.085
I need a nickname
that makes people light up.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.527
You mean like "Liza."

00:32.698 --> 00:34.690
I was thinking...

00:34.868 --> 00:36.358
...T-Bone.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.936
But there's no T in your name.
What about G-Bone?

00:39.105 --> 00:41.039
-There's no G-Bone.
-There's a G-Spot.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.970
That's a myth.

00:43.676 --> 00:46.941
T-Bone, the ladies
are gonna love you.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.921
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?

00:56.089 --> 00:58.455
They heard I opened
for Kenny Rogers once.

01:00.460 --> 01:03.520
Didn't he throw you off a bus
in the middle of Alabama?

01:03.696 --> 01:05.425
Oh, I had that coming to me.

01:05.598 --> 01:08.032
You know, Kenny Rogers has--

01:10.837 --> 01:12.202
Why did you get a maid?

01:12.372 --> 01:15.671
You don't have to whisper.
She knows she's a maid.

01:16.676 --> 01:17.973
Where did you get her?

01:19.712 --> 01:22.044
I hired her from a service.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.709
-All done.
-Thank you. Nice job.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.445
-Is this mine?
-Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.065 --> 01:42.398
-What?
-Come on, Jerry, you didn't notice?

01:42.569 --> 01:45.800
Notice what?
She's not really even a maid.

01:45.972 --> 01:47.963
She wants to be an actress...

01:48.141 --> 01:51.167
...or a model or a dancer...

01:51.344 --> 01:53.812
-...or a newswoman.
-Newswoman.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.174
Well, bad news, boys.

01:58.351 --> 02:01.081
Yeah, my life is over.
My girlfriend's moving away.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.916
-You have a girlfriend?
-Jerry, where have you been?

02:04.090 --> 02:05.580
At a rodeo.

02:05.992 --> 02:08.789
-Where's she moving?
-Downtown.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.827
-Downtown New York?
-Yeah.

02:10.997 --> 02:14.091
I don't know if I can handle one
of these long-distance relationships.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.632
It's like 10 minutes by subway.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.963
I don't know.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.737
Well, you got a maid.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.603
Come on, it's a whole different
world downtown.

02:26.779 --> 02:28.610
Different Gap,
different Tower Records.

02:28.781 --> 02:30.840
And she's a 646.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.242
-What? What's that?
-That's the new area code.

02:33.419 --> 02:36.820
They've run out of 212s so all
the new phone numbers are 646.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.653
I was a 718 when I first moved here.
I cried every night.

02:41.127 --> 02:42.219
Listen, heads up, Elaine.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.829
I'm gonna have to stop by later
and pick up a fax.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.863
-At work?
-No, at your apartment.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.327
I don't have a fax machine.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.093
Here we go.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.663
Well, now what are we gonna do?

02:53.907 --> 02:57.001
See, this is why you should get
a fax and a Xerox.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.077
And a deadbolt.

02:59.546 --> 03:00.774
You sure you don't have one?

03:00.947 --> 03:03.347
There's a lot of stuff in my apartment
I've never seen.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.848
Then maybe you have
a fax machine.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.253
You just blew my mind.

03:11.424 --> 03:12.686
Let's order lunch.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.884
Mary, I will have a chef's salad.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.460
Turkey sandwich.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.097
T-bone steak.

03:19.265 --> 03:24.066
-For lunch?
-Well, I am just a T-bone kind of guy.

03:24.237 --> 03:26.728
Love that T-bone.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.041
-In fact, you might as well call me--
-That sounds good.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.769
I'll have one too.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.574
-Watkins, you're having a T-bone?
-I love them.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.216
Well, then we should call you T-Bone.

03:42.021 --> 03:44.512
-No, no, no, we shouldn't.
-T-Bone.

03:44.691 --> 03:49.128
<i>T-Bone. T-Bone.
T-Bone. T-Bone. T-Bone.</i>

04:00.306 --> 04:02.001
Hello?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.511
What?

04:08.681 --> 04:12.014
<i>You have 57 messages.</i>

04:12.185 --> 04:14.244
<i>Message one.</i>

04:16.555 --> 04:18.649
<i>Message two.</i>

04:20.959 --> 04:22.587
<i>Message three.</i>

04:22.762 --> 04:24.093
<i>Hey, it's George. Listen, I--</i>

04:24.264 --> 04:26.494
<i>Message four.</i>

04:28.568 --> 04:30.092
Kramer.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.209
Hello?

04:48.655 --> 04:51.488
-Well, Cindy, the place looks great.
-Thanks, Jerry. Gotta run.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.558
Okay, I'll see you.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.429
Hi, Elaine.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.577
All right.

05:14.914 --> 05:19.647
Fooling around with your maid.
That is a wise decision.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.486
Elaine, do you think I would go
willy-nilly into a situation...

05:23.656 --> 05:27.490
...so obviously fraught
with potential complications?

05:29.796 --> 05:33.994
You're paying a woman to come
to your house and sleep with you.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.000
No. I pay her to clean.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.296
The rest is--

05:38.504 --> 05:40.472
What? A health plan?

05:42.275 --> 05:45.005
I was going to say,
being a good host.

05:46.446 --> 05:49.108
But the point is, we have
our personal relationship...

05:49.282 --> 05:51.011
...and we have our work
relationship.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.210
They're separate and I think
somewhat sophisticated.

05:54.387 --> 05:57.754
-So you consider this a relationship?
-Yes, I do.

05:58.558 --> 06:01.493
-Have you been out?
-Yes, we have.

06:01.661 --> 06:04.425
-Where did you go?
-The store.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.588
-To get what?
-Stuff.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.529
-Cleaning supplies?
-And gum.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.461
Well, there's nothing more
sophisticated...

06:12.638 --> 06:15.573
...than diddling the maid
and then chewing some gum.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.336
She's not a maid.
She might be a newswoman.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.375
Well, I just saw Madeline off.

06:23.549 --> 06:27.280
Yeah, she's in a cab
and on her way.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.183
I miss her already.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.653
Hey, Kramer, what was it
you were having faxed...

06:33.826 --> 06:37.091
...to my house every 30 seconds?

06:37.263 --> 06:41.529
Well, I signed up for a food delivery
service, "Now We're Cooking."

06:41.701 --> 06:43.965
It's a play on words.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.306
You know, they're faxing me
the menus from some restaurants.

06:48.474 --> 06:49.998
-Which ones?
-Well, all of them.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.700
That's the deluxe package.

06:51.878 --> 06:55.279
-So this is never gonna stop?
-Well, it better not.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.972
I paid for the whole year.

06:58.751 --> 07:02.243
-So should I pick those up later?
-You can pick them up right now.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.762
<i>I wonder if anyone knows
he's here.</i>

07:12.031 --> 07:14.397
<i>If he just disappeared...</i>

07:15.101 --> 07:17.001
<i>...would anybody notice?</i>

07:17.770 --> 07:21.797
All right, Miss Benes. All finished.
Here's your new number.

07:23.376 --> 07:27.176
-Six-four-six? What is this?
-That's your new area code.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.541
I thought 646
was just for new numbers.

07:29.749 --> 07:30.773
This is a new number.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.384
No, no, no.
It's not a new number.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.113
It's just a changed number.

07:36.289 --> 07:40.851
See, it's not different,
it's the same, just changed.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.860
Look, I work
for the phone company.

07:44.030 --> 07:46.555
I've had a lot of experience
with semantics.

07:46.732 --> 07:50.293
So don't try to lure me
into some maze of circular logic.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.339
You know, I could have killed you
and no one would have known.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.805
I could have killed you,
and no one would have known.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.205
Kramer, you're still on the phone?

08:03.382 --> 08:05.316
Madeline and I are watching
<i>Quincy</i> together.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.919
Jerry, you know this comes on
at the same time here...

08:08.087 --> 08:09.611
...as it is does there?

08:09.789 --> 08:12.781
Really? It's Tuesday here.
What day is it there?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.816
Jerry's teasing.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.325
Oh, oh, commercial.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.964
Oh, you're going to the bathroom?
Yeah, I'll go too.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.622
Madeline stays here.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.934
Hey, T-Bone.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.799
No, no T-Bone.

08:29.976 --> 08:33.104
-No T-Bone?
-Hey, is that T-Bone?

08:33.813 --> 08:35.246
No. There's no T-Bone.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.644
-Why no T-Bone?
-Why no T-Bone?

08:37.817 --> 08:40.479
Because Neil Watkins
from Accounting is T-Bone.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.986
I'm back. Hey, you wanna
play cards over the phone?

08:46.158 --> 08:47.648
All right.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.155
Oh, hey, listen, Jerry.

08:50.329 --> 08:53.662
Laundry's piling up there.
You might wanna tell your girlfriend.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.334
Your girlfriend
is doing your laundry?

09:00.506 --> 09:03.304
He's sleeping with his maid.

09:04.677 --> 09:07.339
-You're sleeping with the maid?
-Yes.

09:07.513 --> 09:09.378
I've done that.

09:10.750 --> 09:14.015
-Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
-No.

09:17.189 --> 09:20.625
You're probably one of those women
who doesn't give out her number.

09:20.793 --> 09:23.421
No, I'm not. Here you go.

09:24.363 --> 09:27.127
-Six-four-six?
-It's a new area code.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.860
What area? New Jersey?

09:30.036 --> 09:32.300
No, no, it's right here in the city.

09:32.471 --> 09:37.602
It's the same as 212,
they just multiplied it by three.

09:37.977 --> 09:41.606
And then they added one
to the middle number.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.271
It's the same.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.713
Do I have to dial a "1" first?

09:48.554 --> 09:50.351
I'm really kind of seeing somebody.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.583
Yeah? Well, so am l.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.822
Excuse me, can I talk to you
for a second there, Watkins?

09:57.997 --> 09:59.726
It's T-Bone.

09:59.932 --> 10:04.096
The thing is,
I'm supposed to be T-Bone.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.904
You're not a T-Bone.
You're a perfect George.

10:08.074 --> 10:10.770
What?
Now, you listen to me.

10:11.777 --> 10:16.714
Boy, look at George,
just giving it to T-Bone.

10:17.249 --> 10:20.810
He's jumping up and down
like some kind of monkey.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.921
Hey, what was the name of that--

10:26.092 --> 10:28.583
That monkey that could read
sign language?

10:28.761 --> 10:31.992
All right, you can have T-Bone.
Stop crying.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.997
I'm not crying.

10:36.535 --> 10:39.163
And I shouldn't have said that
about your wife.

10:39.338 --> 10:42.000
Please accept my apologies.

10:44.877 --> 10:48.335
Okay, everybody,
I have an announcement to make.

10:48.514 --> 10:51.574
From now on, I will be known as--

10:51.751 --> 10:53.776
Koko, the monkey.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.059
-What?
-<i>Koko.</i>

11:01.227 --> 11:05.288
<i>Koko. Koko. Koko....</i>

11:05.464 --> 11:07.864
Thank you both for being here.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.602
Excuse me, I live in the building.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.362
Did something happen
to Mrs. Krantz?

11:12.538 --> 11:13.664
She passed.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.535
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Thank you.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.873
Quick question...

11:19.045 --> 11:22.913
...did she by any chance
have a 212 phone number?

11:24.717 --> 11:27.049
I can't find my earring.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.680
Oh, here it is.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.880
Listen, can I borrow your suitcases?

11:32.058 --> 11:34.253
-Yeah, it's in your closet.
-No, no, no. I looked.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.759
They're behind my skis
and my tennis racket.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.863
-Thanks, buddy.
-Where you going?

11:39.031 --> 11:42.194
I'm getting out of town. I'm gonna
visit Madeline for the weekend.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.235
This place is looking kind of messy.
What happened to Cindy?

11:45.404 --> 11:48.237
Oh, she's here.
She's just didn't get around to it.

11:48.808 --> 11:50.537
Hi, Kramer.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.904
Thanks, Jerry. Bye.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.845
Well, what's the matter?

12:01.020 --> 12:02.544
What did I just pay for?

12:04.623 --> 12:06.887
You're a john.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.163
-Koko?
-Koko.

12:16.335 --> 12:19.634
Well, it's probably
the most intelligent ape there is.

12:20.206 --> 12:21.696
Yeah.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.874
So how's Cindy the maid?

12:25.044 --> 12:27.945
Everything's going great,
except basically, I'm paying for sex.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.548
Tell me about it.
I went out with a girl last week.

12:30.716 --> 12:32.581
-First I paid for dinner--
-No, George.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.882
She's coming over and not cleaning.
It's like I'm seeing a prostitute.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.921
-How much you pay this maid?
-Forty.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.752
Forty? I'm paying 60 to my maid.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.985
She doesn't do laundry
and I'm getting nothing.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.528
-All right.
-Once she pinched my ass...

12:45.698 --> 12:47.427
...but I don't know what that was.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.124
I don't know what this is.

12:49.301 --> 12:51.166
Hey, hey, hey.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.639
Jerry, you wouldn't believe
what it's like down there.

12:56.809 --> 13:00.301
Taxi cab drivers are insane.
You know, everybody is in a hurry.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.674
I can't eat with you
leaning over like this.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.338
Just look straight forward.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.086
-Well, now I can't see Jerry.
-I look about the same.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.085
-What?
-I was talking to him.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.019
-What?
-Never mind.

13:12.191 --> 13:13.886
-Come on, what did he say?
-Never mind.

13:14.059 --> 13:17.961
-Jerry, come on, what'd you say?
-What?

13:19.031 --> 13:21.499
-Where'd you go?
-Go back.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.796
-What'd you say?
-I said never mind.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.301
Yeah, I know that.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.197
I hate the counter.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.637
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.675
Oh, I hate the counter.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.210
Yeah, who's that?

13:34.380 --> 13:35.506
I got a 212 number...

13:35.681 --> 13:38.149
...from this little old lady
in my building, Mrs. Krantz.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.682
-She didn't mind?
-No, she died.

13:39.852 --> 13:42.013
-That's great.
-What happened to Mrs. Krantz?

13:42.188 --> 13:44.019
Elaine got a new number
because she died.

13:45.457 --> 13:47.118
Newman died?

13:47.293 --> 13:49.454
-What did he say?
-Some new kind of pie.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.721
-I'll try a piece.
-Who's down there?

13:51.897 --> 13:53.797
Hey, there's a booth.

13:55.367 --> 13:57.130
-Hey, Elaine.
-Oh, hi.

13:57.536 --> 14:00.630
-Did you hear about Newman?
-What?

14:03.409 --> 14:05.707
So how's it going at work?
Did they get tired of it?

14:05.878 --> 14:07.277
Oh, yeah.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.914
-Double zero?
-It's "oo."

14:14.086 --> 14:15.849
As in:

14:16.989 --> 14:18.547
Your nickname's Koko?

14:19.725 --> 14:22.159
One of the girls at the maid
service is named Coco.

14:22.328 --> 14:25.161
-Really? Coco?
-Yeah. Coco.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.458
That girl's all right.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.627
You know, if I could get this
Coco woman down to Kruger...

14:30.803 --> 14:33.203
...then they wouldn't be able to
call me Koko anymore.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.237
Because Kruger
would never allow two Kokos.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.568
Sounds like he runs a real
tight ship.

14:37.743 --> 14:40.371
Say goodbye to Koko.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.538
-Goodbye, Koko.
-Goodbye, Koko.

14:44.316 --> 14:47.513
Jerry, this relationship
is killing me.

14:47.686 --> 14:50.382
The distance, the longing,
the distance, the--

14:50.556 --> 14:53.582
You know, I didn't realize it,
but I'm a needy person.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.053
Kramer, maybe this relationship
isn't for you.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.890
Oh, yeah? So, what am I supposed
to do? Be more like you?

14:59.064 --> 15:02.033
All sealed up in here,
emotionally unavailable?

15:02.201 --> 15:04.726
Paying scrubwomen
for sexual favors?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.338
No. Jerry. I won't be like you.

15:07.506 --> 15:09.701
Never. I'll never be like you.

15:14.013 --> 15:16.777
-What was that?
-I didn't hear anything.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.940
-All right, I'm taking off.
-Okay.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.183
-Aren't you forgetting something?
-Oh, right.

15:22.354 --> 15:25.323
It was great seeing you again.
I love your outfit.

15:26.558 --> 15:27.923
No, my money.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.520
-For what?
-For my maid services.

15:30.696 --> 15:34.223
-You booked me for today.
-But you really didn't do any work.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.662
I made the bed.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.893
But you took a nap in it.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.161
So?

15:39.338 --> 15:42.239
I thought that was kind of
girlfriend bed-making.

15:42.408 --> 15:43.807
No, that was the maid.

15:43.976 --> 15:45.000
Who took the nap?

15:45.177 --> 15:46.439
The girlfriend.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.609
Forty dollars seems
kind of steep for a nap.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.909
So, what are you saying?
That I'm a bad maid...

15:52.084 --> 15:53.642
...or some kind of a prostitute?

15:57.156 --> 16:00.785
Hold on.
Let's keep this sophisticated.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.656
You know, I don't think I wanna be
your girlfriend or maid.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.821
So is this a break-up/quitting?

16:05.998 --> 16:08.330
Yeah. Don't ever call me
or hire me again.

16:08.500 --> 16:13.130
Oh, yeah? Well, then we're through
and you're fired.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.367
-Sign here.
-Yes.

16:17.543 --> 16:18.737
Two-one-two,

16:18.944 --> 16:21.003
Hey, what happened to the guy
I had last time?

16:21.180 --> 16:22.807
Oh, you know, it's an odd thing.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.951
He went out on a job,
never came back.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.710
Nobody knows what happened.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.150
All right. I am back in the game.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.453
-Hello?
-<i>Gammy.</i>

16:36.628 --> 16:39.620
-No, you got the wrong number, kid.
-<i>Gammy Krantz?</i>

16:39.798 --> 16:42.961
<i>It's your grandson Bobby.
Why haven't you called?</i>

16:43.135 --> 16:45.160
Oh, nuts.

16:46.071 --> 16:49.040
<i>Do you hate me
because of my lazy eye?</i>

16:50.075 --> 16:55.206
No, it's just that I've been
kind of buried over here.

16:57.916 --> 17:00.043
So the kid doesn't know
his grandmother is dead?

17:00.219 --> 17:02.483
-G-5.
-Hit.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.645
No, I guess his parents
didn't wanna tell him.

17:04.823 --> 17:07.314
-B-2?
-Miss.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.688
He called six times yesterday.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.694
What a nightmare it must be
to have a real family.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.799
I wouldn't worry about it.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.127
-B-6?
-Hit.

17:17.301 --> 17:19.098
You sank my submarine.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.296
Elaine?

17:29.782 --> 17:32.080
-Hello?
-<i>You have a collect call from--</i>

17:32.251 --> 17:34.583
-<i>Hey, buddy, don't say no!</i>
-I accept.

17:34.753 --> 17:37.745
I went down to Madeline's.
I told her you gotta move or it's over.

17:37.923 --> 17:40.255
-Well, what happened?
-I think it's over.

17:41.693 --> 17:43.524
We had a big fight,
she threw me out...

17:43.695 --> 17:45.788
...I started walking
and now I'm lost downtown.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.762
I don't have any money.
I don't recognize anybody.

17:48.934 --> 17:52.665
I miss home.
I don't even know how to get there.

17:53.972 --> 17:57.169
-What's around you?
-I'm looking at Ray's Pizza.

17:57.342 --> 17:59.469
-You know where that is?
-Is it Famous Ray's?

17:59.645 --> 18:02.614
-No, it's Original Ray's.
-Famous Original Ray's?

18:02.781 --> 18:04.214
It's just Original, Jerry.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.241
Well, what street are you on?

18:08.687 --> 18:10.917
Okay, I'm on 1st and 1st.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.650
How can the same street
intersect with itself?

18:13.826 --> 18:16.624
I must be at the nexus
of the universe.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.263
Just wait there. I'll pick you up.
And Kramer...

18:19.431 --> 18:23.891
...stay alive. No matter what occurs,
I will find you.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.604
-You Steinfeld?
-Yeah.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.835
My name is Maxwell.
I'm from Maid to Order.

18:33.011 --> 18:34.808
It's a pun.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.210
-I sent one of my girls to your place.
-Cindy.

18:37.382 --> 18:40.146
She says she had a little problem
with you, you didn't pay.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.583
She didn't really do
what she was supposed to do.

18:42.754 --> 18:44.745
Oh, yeah? She told me
what you like.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.550
You're a little sickie, aren't you?

18:46.725 --> 18:49.125
Disinfectant on the blinds,
vacuuming the couch.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.694
Hey, hey, come on, come on.
I gotta live around here.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.162
You know what I do to people
who stiff me on a job?

18:54.333 --> 18:56.995
-What?
-It kind of depends on the situation.

18:57.169 --> 19:00.627
But if I don't get my money from you,
I'm gonna get it from her.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.639
I don't want any trouble.
You want the money, here it is.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.606
Give it to the girl.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.802
I'm an independent contractor.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.141
Tax purposes.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.446
Bobby, you gotta
stop calling your gammy.

19:16.622 --> 19:17.884
Why?

19:18.056 --> 19:20.490
Because sometimes you call
very early in the morning...

19:20.659 --> 19:24.652
...when Gammy has been out late
the night before.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.957
And sometimes
when Gammy's not alone.

19:28.267 --> 19:32.397
Your parents still haven't said
anything to you about your gammy?

19:33.305 --> 19:35.830
All right. Here we go.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.868
Gammy doesn't feel so good.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.446
I think Gammy might be dying.

19:43.615 --> 19:47.711
Yup, yup. Okay. Goodbye, Bobby.
Don't call anymore.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.252
I'm dead now. Gotta go.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.551
Nine-one-one.

19:56.328 --> 19:59.320
Nexus of the universe.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.662
Hey.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.463
Cindy. Cindy.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.331
-What do you want?
-Here. I got your money.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.338
I don't want any money from you.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.602
Come on, take it. It's money.

20:12.778 --> 20:16.612
-Let me give it to you.
-<i>Looking for a good time, sir?</i>

20:16.782 --> 20:20.343
You wanna step out of the car,
sickie?

20:22.287 --> 20:26.053
Well, this is all very sophisticated.

20:28.961 --> 20:32.089
All right, hang on, Gammy.
You're gonna make it.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.929
Hey, you look a little lost.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.300
-You from around here?
-No.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.339
-You know where you're going?
-Not really.

20:44.509 --> 20:47.307
My friend was supposed to pick
me up. I don't know where he is.

20:47.479 --> 20:49.242
Doesn't sound like much
of a friend.

20:50.949 --> 20:53.281
-You got any money?
-No.

20:53.452 --> 20:54.783
You wanna make some?

20:55.354 --> 20:56.582
Okay.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.749
Do you know how
to use a mop wringer?

21:00.359 --> 21:01.758
Yeah, yeah.

21:03.328 --> 21:04.795
Why don't you get in the car?

21:08.734 --> 21:10.497
Hi.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.933
These are soft seats.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.312
Hey, Koko, who's this?

21:28.053 --> 21:31.819
This is our new vice president
of acquisitions, sir.

21:31.990 --> 21:34.652
So you're just hiring
new people now?

21:35.961 --> 21:38.657
That's your job?
To hire people?

21:40.766 --> 21:42.324
Yes.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.830
Okay, good enough for me, Koko.

21:47.439 --> 21:51.273
-Well, what's your name?
-My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.

21:51.443 --> 21:55.504
-What, Coco?
-We can't have two Cocos.

21:55.947 --> 21:57.710
So I guess you're back
to being George.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.115
Well, it was a hell of a ride.

22:00.285 --> 22:03.652
All right. The Grace Building.

22:04.323 --> 22:08.191
There's a big stain on the front.
How do we get it off?

22:08.694 --> 22:10.662
When I was a little girl in Jamaica...

22:10.829 --> 22:13.263
...my gammy taught me
to take a wet rag and--

22:13.432 --> 22:19.428
Excuse me, vice president Coco.
No one cares about your gammy.

22:19.905 --> 22:22.169
What did you say
about my gammy?

22:22.341 --> 22:23.365
Forget Gammy.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.703
-Who's Gammy?
-There's no Gammy.

22:25.877 --> 22:27.572
Maybe there should be a Gammy.

22:28.113 --> 22:31.207
-Oh, no.
-George.

22:31.383 --> 22:34.546
<i>Gammy. Gammy. Gammy.
Gammy. Gammy. Gammy.</i>

22:34.720 --> 22:36.745
Gammy's getting upset.

22:37.305 --> 22:43.222
