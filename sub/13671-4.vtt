00:01.040 --> 00:01.760
'Previously on St Elsewhere...'

00:01.760 --> 00:03.800
'Previously on St Elsewhere...'

00:03.800 --> 00:07.080
Maybe you like pushing papers,
but I need a piece of the OR action.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.280
The sooner I get home
and focus on this hand,

00:09.280 --> 00:10.520
the sooner I'll be back.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.520
Every July, I watch new residents.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.880
There are always one or two like you,

00:14.880 --> 00:16.800
who decide they want things
their own way.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.200
I'm not like that.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.000
I'm not like that.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.680
I'm not like that.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.240
He'll need chronic supportive care
somewhere else.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.680
We're taking you home, Daddy.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.200
You could become my assistant

00:27.200 --> 00:29.360
and work with me
until you finish college.

00:29.360 --> 00:33.360
Bend the rules a bit.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.280
(TV) 'There's a ¤2,000 space
on the wheel.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.160
'I'm sure that interests
our players.

01:59.160 --> 02:03.160
'We'll get to our next puzzle now.
"Person" is the category.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.560
'400.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.600
'I'd like an S, Pat.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.960
'We've got one for you.
In fact, we've got two,

02:12.960 --> 02:16.840
'and that's ¤800.'

02:16.840 --> 02:19.960
Person with two S's...

02:19.960 --> 02:23.160
Siegfried Sassoon.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.320
No, that's four.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.840
'I'll buy a vowel.
I'd like an E, please.'

02:27.840 --> 02:29.120
Obvious choice.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.560
'We can arrange that.

02:30.560 --> 02:34.560
'One E, two E's.'

02:35.320 --> 02:36.920
Bebe Rebozo.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.920
No, that's three Es and a Z.

02:41.840 --> 02:45.160
Who's that lady
in the evening gown,

02:45.160 --> 02:48.640
and why is she clapping?

02:48.640 --> 02:50.600
Glasses go
in this cupboard.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.640
Da.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.640
Silverware goes
in that top drawer.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.840
Dr Craig likes spoons
separated by size -

02:58.840 --> 03:01.000
table, tea, and soup.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.800
Da. What kind
doctor he is?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.200
A heart surgeon.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.160
Heart surgeon
is wonderful.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.120
Why is not
in surgery?

03:09.120 --> 03:11.480
He's injured
his hand.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.920
Oh, how terrible.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.480
Great artist stricken.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.760
The artist
should get up

03:16.760 --> 03:19.320
so you can
make the bed.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.600
&lt; (BABY CRIES)

03:20.600 --> 03:22.520
Barbara needs
her bottle.

03:22.520 --> 03:23.800
Mark...

03:23.800 --> 03:27.800
Mark!

03:28.440 --> 03:29.520
'400.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.480
'I'd like an L.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.120
'Sure. Three L's.'

03:33.120 --> 03:37.120
What kind of name
has two Ps and three Ls?

03:37.600 --> 03:38.880
'You have ¤1,800.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.640
'I'll solve the puzzle.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.160
'Priscilla Presley.'

03:42.160 --> 03:43.640
Priscilla Presley?

03:43.640 --> 03:46.960
Ellen, who the hell
is Priscilla Presley?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.640
Elvis' widow.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.280
Wives of rock'n'roll stars?

03:51.280 --> 03:53.680
How should I know that?

03:53.680 --> 03:56.080
You're unfamiliar
with popular culture.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.920
I hope so.
Leave that on.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.880
You're not lying
in bed today.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.680
I'm getting used
to the room

04:04.680 --> 04:06.120
since you redecorated.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.080
Natasha has to clean,

04:08.080 --> 04:10.160
and you can find
the scotch cooler.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.560
Who's Natasha?

04:11.560 --> 04:13.040
The new maid.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.280
Oh, yeah.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.519
First you hire
a troglodyte

04:16.519 --> 04:18.399
to assassinate
the shrubbery.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.279
Now some
KGB defector

04:20.279 --> 04:22.200
is sifting
through my drawers.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.240
The agency
recommended her.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.480
She's got
her green card.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.240
Her English is good.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.680
She'll do fine.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.000
And leave Dino alone.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.320
No problem.
He never shows up.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.480
Find the cooler.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.960
I'm taking Barbara
for a picnic.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.480
The attic's hot

04:39.480 --> 04:41.800
and packed
to the rafters.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.640
It'll take me to Donahue
to find the damn thing.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.680
Please.
I'm feeding Barbara.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.000
Mail in yet?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.280
No.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.480
Lesniak...probably
parked under a tree

04:51.480 --> 04:53.840
dreaming about
his Keogh Plan.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.880
How's your hand?

04:55.880 --> 04:57.000
Perfect.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.880
No strength, no grip.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.880
Couldn't crush an Oreo.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.200
'One N.'

05:15.920 --> 05:19.920
I knew I'd find you here.
Help me take these dudes to X-ray.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.800
I'm due in ER.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.200
You're working with me.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.400
I picked up another shift.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.960
You're really becoming
a physician's assistant?

05:27.960 --> 05:29.480
No doubt about it!

05:29.480 --> 05:31.840
It's four years
of night school

05:31.840 --> 05:34.560
before you can
enter the programme.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.000
You're jealous.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.440
No, sensible.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.640
I had a basketball
scholarship to BC.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.600
Tore up your knee
in sophomore year.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.280
Never played pro.
Never even finished school.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.040
Now I'm an orderly.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.960
Just because you rolled over,

05:47.960 --> 05:50.360
doesn't mean I have to.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.440
You're no better
than me.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.680
Where's
the Gardella chart?

05:54.680 --> 05:57.560
It's not my turn
to watch it.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.760
How was your
grandmother's party?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.720
Just another
Greek tragedy.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.240
Victor said he had
a wonderful time.

06:04.240 --> 06:08.240
Did Victor say why
he had a wonderful time?

06:08.640 --> 06:11.480
Yes. Ouzo,
bouzouki music,

06:11.480 --> 06:12.880
flying crockery.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.320
Sounds fun.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.080
3232, not 2323.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.960
I guess some people

06:18.960 --> 06:21.360
just aren't programmed
for happiness.

06:21.360 --> 06:22.800
Peggy,
how's tricks?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.280
Fine, fine, fine.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.680
Have you seen
Dr Axelrod?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.080
No, I haven't.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.320
We have
a pre-op counselling

06:30.320 --> 06:32.280
for an ostomy revision.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.160
If you see him,

06:34.160 --> 06:36.880
tell him Suzanne McConnell's
in 3126.

06:36.880 --> 06:40.880
All right.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.040
Elliot. How's your dim sum?

06:54.040 --> 06:55.520
What are you doing?

06:55.520 --> 06:56.920
Hiding.

06:56.920 --> 06:57.680
Craig's gone.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.160
Craig's gone.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.680
Papandrao said things
won't be the same.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.040
You're telling me.
She's one ornery gal.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.920
You're
one bloated guy.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.360
The hot weather.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.080
Ice cream, gelato.
It adds up.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.320
Summertime.
Got to be sleek.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.560
Easy for you to say.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.840
No. I slur my S's.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.680
I'm your
classic ectomorph.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.280
If I had
your body...

07:21.280 --> 07:22.440
You wouldn't be happier.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.440
You wouldn't be happier.

07:24.440 --> 07:27.400
It's tough looking  at  you.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.120
I gotta go.
Ostomy revision
pre-op. Yecch!

07:31.120 --> 07:34.360
An ostomy's
not a good time,

07:34.360 --> 07:37.720
but ulcerative colitis
is worse.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.440
The intestinal lining
becomes a mass of ulcers.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.480
Nobody knows the cause.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.440
An ostomy isn't pretty,

07:45.440 --> 07:48.240
but it beats a lifetime
of bloody diarrhoea.

07:48.240 --> 07:52.240
The whole thing
gives me the willies.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.120
It's primal stuff -
early childhood,

07:55.120 --> 07:56.640
dependency,
potty training.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.880
Wassner says
that body image

07:58.880 --> 08:01.600
is at the root
of identity

08:01.600 --> 08:03.040
and self-worth.

08:03.040 --> 08:07.040
He had no mirrors
in his house.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.760
Blade went through
the biceps.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.320
This will cut down
on Nautilus time.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.480
Free weights or die.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.680
You pop these sutures,
don't come back.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.800
Why'd he stab you?

08:18.800 --> 08:20.720
I stabbed him first.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.720
Sounds reasonable.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.680
Hold that thought.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.200
Luther, could you
dress that wound?

08:29.200 --> 08:33.200
Sure.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.799
Your father's weak
from the stroke.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.080
He'll require constant care.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.000
He'll require constant care.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.440
If complications arise
or you feel overwhelmed,

08:44.440 --> 08:47.360
we can re-admit him
to St Eligius.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.520
My father's
going to die.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.560
We should be together
in his home,

08:53.560 --> 08:55.560
not a hospital.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.320
Besides,
Thor is waiting.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.880
Thor?

08:59.880 --> 09:01.280
His golden retriever.

09:01.280 --> 09:04.600
He loves him
more than the Red Sox.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.520
I'm a trained paramedic.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.760
Get your hands off.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.800
No janitor's messing with me.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.760
Fine. I hope it gets infected.

09:14.760 --> 09:18.160
I'll come by later
and check on the part-time nurse.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.120
Thank you.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.560
Thank you.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.560
She thinks he belongs
in a nursing home.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.880
Will he know
where he is?

09:27.880 --> 09:31.880
Yes. If not, we'll tell him.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.080
I've never done
this before...

09:35.080 --> 09:37.000
watched my father die.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.080
Who has, right?

09:39.080 --> 09:41.640
One of those things
you do once.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.440
You're
doing it right.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.800
I want one last chance

09:45.800 --> 09:49.800
to get through
to my old man.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.600
The older sister
called. She's adamant.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.200
I found the best place
for Joe to die.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.200
I'm not sure.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.880
We can keep
people alive here.

10:06.880 --> 10:10.080
Why can't we
serve them in death?

10:10.080 --> 10:12.320
I've been here
40 years.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.280
Is it so hideous?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.480
If you ask me, yeah.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.480
Who asked you?

10:21.200 --> 10:24.480
Suzanne McConnell.
Hi, Suzanne.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.080
Chronic ulcerative colitis.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.880
Nearly 10 years' worth.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.160
Running to the bathroom
every 20 minutes.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.080
You had an ileostomy
18 months ago?

10:35.080 --> 10:36.960
To prevent
colon cancer.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.480
Now you're getting
a conversion

10:38.480 --> 10:40.720
to a continent
ileal reservoir.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.840
The surgeon fashions
an internal reservoir.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.600
Stools drain
intermittently.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.280
The stoma has
a nipple valve

10:48.280 --> 10:50.600
that you'll catheterise
through - no more bag.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.400
Cover the opening
with a bandage.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.240
God knows I don't
want a second hole

10:58.240 --> 11:00.120
punched in my side,

11:00.120 --> 11:02.480
but to get rid
of this bag,

11:02.480 --> 11:04.200
I'd even do
your laundry.

11:04.200 --> 11:08.200
Doctor, why don't you
examine for hernia?

11:08.680 --> 11:10.520
Oh, certainly.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.520
Glad to.

11:16.080 --> 11:20.080
Well, not much irritation
in the stoma.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.600
No hernia.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.600
This appliance
fits well.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.440
As long as I don't go
to dance class.

11:28.440 --> 11:32.440
Leg lifts
knock it loose.

11:33.080 --> 11:36.520
Could there be
a prolapse of the stoma?

11:36.520 --> 11:40.520
Let's take a look.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
You were probably
this bad with bras
in high school.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.840
As a matter
of fact, yeah.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.280
Let me help.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.120
Feel free.

11:54.120 --> 11:58.120
My ex-husband
saw my bag
and packed his own.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.760
That's terrible.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.480
I mean,
not the joke

12:02.480 --> 12:03.920
or the stoma,

12:03.920 --> 12:05.760
but I mean him.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.560
He never came
near me again.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.280
It's hard
to feel sexy

12:10.280 --> 12:14.280
with this backpack
on your side.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.960
Well,
it's not so bad.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.880
It looks fine.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.040
The surgery
should be no problem.

12:24.040 --> 12:28.040
Dr Kiem's
a real good doctor.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.160
It'll be, um...

12:32.160 --> 12:35.000
I, uh...

12:35.000 --> 12:37.640
Could you
finish this for me?

12:37.640 --> 12:39.560
I've got to, um...

12:39.560 --> 12:43.560
I've got to go.

12:47.160 --> 12:50.160
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.480
It's good to cut
with a variety
of surgeons.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.360
This ileal reservoir
conversion

12:55.360 --> 12:57.280
can be very tricky.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.720
Tomorrow I'll need

12:58.720 --> 13:01.880
all your expertise
and experience.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.000
I have faith
in your confidence.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.920
Training
with Mark Craig

13:05.920 --> 13:07.720
is training
with the best.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.880
Good-bye Victor, Jackie.

13:08.880 --> 13:09.920
Good-bye Victor, Jackie.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.880
See you in scrubs.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.760
The coast is clear.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.160
I'm dreading
working with her.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.600
She's excellent.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.320
The ambiance in OR.
is unbelievable.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.960
She's no Mark Craig.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.520
Yeah? So what?

13:23.520 --> 13:25.600
After accompanying
Stravinsky,

13:25.600 --> 13:29.600
you can't settle
for the Dave Clark Five.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.040
Did you find
the cooler?

13:33.040 --> 13:37.040
WHIRRING

13:37.560 --> 13:39.040
All aboard!

here at Fenway,

13:53.960 --> 13:56.480
'25 of Baylor's home runs
have been off righties.'

13:56.480 --> 13:58.880
What about
that kid pitcher?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.880
20 Ks in one game.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.960
Clemens.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.400
Clemens, right.
What a fan.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.640
Daddy brought
this from Oaxaca.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.200
Looks like
a Mexican menorah.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.760
Your father likes
my infield chatter.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.000
He loves the Bosox.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.960
Nice epitaph,
Mr Ewell.

14:17.960 --> 14:21.600
"All in all,
I'd rather be at Fenway."

14:21.600 --> 14:23.600
Lorraine.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.920
Lorraine's
not here now.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.920
She's coming tomorrow.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.920
Are you hungry?

14:34.800 --> 14:37.480
Try a protein powder
smoothie.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.000
A smoothie.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.360
We'd go
to the carnival.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.200
We'd get
cotton candy.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.000
Snow cones.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.440
You want a snow cone?

14:46.440 --> 14:50.440
DOORBELL RINGS

14:52.560 --> 14:55.640
We should put lotion on his
heels, elbows, and shoulders.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.640
We don't want bed sores.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.360
Dr Auschlander.
What are you doing here?

15:07.360 --> 15:11.080
Let's say I'm doing
personal field research.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.960
'Way over the scoreboard
it goes!'

15:13.960 --> 15:16.880
Would you give me
the injection

15:16.880 --> 15:19.760
before I swooze
into the ozone?

15:19.760 --> 15:22.320
Is this your kit?

15:22.320 --> 15:26.000
Mine and nobody else's.
I'm allergic to bee stings.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.920
Give me the shot!

15:27.920 --> 15:30.080
I'm too shaky.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.600
What's the problem?

15:31.600 --> 15:33.040
A bee sting.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.480
How old's
this kit?

15:34.480 --> 15:36.440
Would you
hurry up?

15:36.440 --> 15:39.360
I'm beginning
to zone out.

15:39.360 --> 15:43.360
(WHEEZES)

15:43.760 --> 15:46.720
Anaphylactic shock.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.080
I hope this
hasn't expired.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.320
It's up-to-date.
I live in fear.

15:52.320 --> 15:56.240
We're neighbours.
I'm from Roxbury.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.240
Let's lie her down.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.520
You'll be all right.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.440
So what happened?

16:04.440 --> 16:06.720
Jogging along the Charles,

16:06.720 --> 16:09.560
ran into two bees
bumping together

16:09.560 --> 16:11.080
in connubial bliss.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.600
They weren't happy
being interrupted.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.200
Well, I would have
stung you too.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.120
Want some oxygen?

16:19.120 --> 16:22.280
No, the epinephrine's
kicking in.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.720
Are you sure?

16:23.720 --> 16:24.560
Yeah, on second thought.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.640
Yeah, on second thought.

16:25.640 --> 16:29.520
I'll do that.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.960
Bee sting.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.360
Allergic reaction,
anaphylaxis.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.800
What's next?

16:34.800 --> 16:36.840
Run a glucose IV,

16:36.840 --> 16:38.680
monitor BP
and respiration.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.120
Sounds good.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.480
Correct me
if I'm wrong...

16:42.480 --> 16:43.160
Hawkins?

16:43.160 --> 16:44.200
Hawkins?

16:44.200 --> 16:45.040
You're an orderly.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.360
You're an orderly.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.320
Luther's training
for physician's assistant.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.280
Only licensed PA's
can give injections

16:51.280 --> 16:52.920
and run IVs.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.040
I completed
my paramedic courses.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.920
We need the help.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.200
I don't think
it's a good idea.

17:00.200 --> 17:04.200
I'll get the IV.

17:11.079 --> 17:15.079
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

17:16.800 --> 17:20.440
There she goes.
I haven't had this much fun

17:20.440 --> 17:23.880
since BJ Hunicutt and I
closed the Kim Chee Palace.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.319
DOORBELL RINGS

17:25.319 --> 17:26.760
Lesniak, at last.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.760
Here, take over
the throttle.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.240
Isn't it union
regulations that you
always ring twice?

17:39.480 --> 17:41.280
Here's today's catch.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.720
Hello, Mrs Craig.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.600
Nice train.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.240
Thanks.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.400
Stay away from
the transformer.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.760
Where were you?

17:49.760 --> 17:53.760
The postal system
should be given to
the private sector,

17:54.040 --> 17:55.840
then you'd work.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.920
Maybe I don't
save lives,

17:58.920 --> 18:02.320
but Duggan over there
depends on me

18:02.320 --> 18:04.520
to bring
social security checks.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.720
That Crowley girl's
expected

18:06.720 --> 18:09.560
a love letter
from her boyfriend.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.400
Just gave it to her.
You should've seen her.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.720
I delivered
your son Stephen's

18:15.720 --> 18:17.800
acceptance
to med school.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.320
He was waiting
in the driveway.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.200
You think I don't
count for squat,

18:23.200 --> 18:24.920
but I'm needed.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.920
I'm moved.
I'm touched.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.920
I'm closing
the door.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.960
Lesniak...the perfect end
to the perfect day.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.880
Could you run
to the store?

18:37.880 --> 18:41.520
All junk mail
and a get well card.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.080
What do you need?

18:43.080 --> 18:43.680
Pampers.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.360
Pampers.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.280
The dippy duck diaper
service didn't show.

18:48.280 --> 18:51.720
I warned you
never to trust
Barbara's bottom

18:51.720 --> 18:55.720
to that quackpot.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.560
Wade Boggs is
a threat to hit 400.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.560
We'll go to Fenway
sometime, Mr Ewell.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.720
Is Luis Tiant
still pitching?

19:11.720 --> 19:13.680
Luis Tiant?

19:13.680 --> 19:16.080
He should stop
smoking cigars.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.960
He's been gone
for years.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.840
I could swear
I saw him on TV.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.720
I'll make
that smoothie.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.520
Heavy on
the protein powder.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.720
Here's something
from the '60s.

19:27.720 --> 19:31.120
Got a back-beat,
you can't lose it.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.520
Tibetan bells.

19:32.520 --> 19:35.480
Ever read the Tibetan
Book Of The Dead?

19:35.480 --> 19:37.680
No. It's on the top
of my list.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.160
Familiar
with the bardo?

19:40.160 --> 19:42.080
No, only her movies.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.840
The bardo's
a realm of being.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.040
There are bardos of life
and of afterlife.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.520
Tibetans believe
death, or dying,

19:50.520 --> 19:53.240
is only a moment
of passage

19:53.240 --> 19:56.680
between the two realms.

19:56.680 --> 20:00.680
Only a moment.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.400
Here we go.
Are you hungry?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.880
Will you have
some of this?

20:05.880 --> 20:07.120
Please?

20:07.120 --> 20:08.360
Thor?

20:08.360 --> 20:10.440
Thor's
right here, OK?

20:10.440 --> 20:14.240
Lorraine?

20:14.240 --> 20:16.120
She'll be here soon.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.400
Your sister's
coming?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.960
If she gets
around to it.

20:19.960 --> 20:23.960
She'd better get
around to it soon.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.240
DOG WHINES

20:29.240 --> 20:31.600
No, I think
this is a good idea.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.440
We should eat lunch
every week

20:33.440 --> 20:35.360
and air departmental
grievances.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.520
If doctors would
do their job...

20:37.520 --> 20:40.800
We can't blame everything
on the doctors.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.240
Just the residents.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.120
Residents have
a very pressured life.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.440
Like I said,
Axelrod dropped
the ball.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.800
We shouldn't bear grudges
or be petty.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.720
Ah, where's
the cauldron?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.160
Get it?

20:55.160 --> 20:57.120
Macbeth,
the three witches?

20:57.120 --> 20:58.520
Take a hike.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.320
Then again,
some residents are scum.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.320
That's what I mean.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.200
She was going into
anaphylactic shock.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.640
Hidey-ho.
What's up?

21:07.640 --> 21:09.120
Bee sting.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.320
She was the colour
of Quaker oats.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.960
Saved her with epi.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.800
How many people die
from insect bites?

21:16.800 --> 21:19.200
Anybody play
the megabucks art lottery?

21:19.200 --> 21:20.560
Elliot?

21:20.560 --> 21:22.880
Uh...no.

21:22.880 --> 21:26.880
What's the story on
this Luther Hawkins?

21:26.920 --> 21:29.320
Upward mobility,
the American way.

21:29.320 --> 21:33.320
Pass the non-dairy
petrochemical creamer.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.280
One more number
for megabucks.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.480
Damn. So close,
yet so far.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.320
I was almost rich.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.200
Shotwell,
how's the ostomy racket?

21:44.200 --> 21:46.600
Some don't
handle it well.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.040
Take Dr Axelrod.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.600
Never do that again!

21:49.600 --> 21:51.040
Let's talk
privately.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.200
You're pathetic.

21:52.200 --> 21:56.200
Some of the patients
are braver than you are.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.240
I'll vouch for that.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.360
Using a bag
is a tough concept.

22:01.360 --> 22:04.120
Could we not talk
ostomies at lunch?

22:04.120 --> 22:07.280
This society's
hung up on toilets.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.840
Indoor plumbing's
the backbone of civilisation.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.320
We have to keep
ostomates comfortable.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.400
Don't say "ostomate".

22:14.400 --> 22:15.560
Sorry.

22:15.560 --> 22:19.560
What is it exactly,
Doctor, you can't handle?

22:20.200 --> 22:24.200
Uh, Suzanne living
with the hole
in her side.

22:24.520 --> 22:27.400
You know,
bag or no bag,

22:27.400 --> 22:29.800
talking about sex,
it's repulsive.

22:29.800 --> 22:33.800
You're not so delicious
yourself, haystack.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.240
Cause of death, mesothelioma,
probably contracted 20 years ago.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.640
When I was a resident, mesothelioma
was as rare as leprosy.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.040
Now it's turning up
frequently.

22:49.040 --> 22:52.480
We live in
a carcinogenic century.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.240
He's in his
apocalyptic mood.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.760
As health care improves,

22:56.760 --> 22:59.280
the world seems
to get sicker.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.280
That's all.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.080
I heard you caught hell
in the cafeteria.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.920
I didn't eat the tostada salad.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.360
I mean Shotwell.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.760
She really
hurt my feelings.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.760
Imagine how this
McConnell girl suffers.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.200
May I have a word
with you?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.440
No. Let's walk and talk, all right?

23:29.440 --> 23:32.120
Sure.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.080
It's about the ER.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.520
It's about the ER.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.520
There's
an unlicensed guy

23:36.520 --> 23:38.400
practising
on patients.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.280
He's running IVs,
giving physicals, injections.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.160
I just wanted
you to know

23:44.160 --> 23:46.640
because the hospital
could get sued.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.200
What's his name?

23:48.200 --> 23:49.920
An orderly, Hawkins.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.640
Luther is Auschlander's
special project.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.640
He's over-extended himself.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.200
Well, I'm no
wave-maker,

23:57.200 --> 23:58.840
and actually,
we're shorthanded.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.360
Still, I'm glad
you told me.

24:01.360 --> 24:05.360
It's for the good
of the hospital.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.440
I just hope
I don't embarrass Dr Kiem.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.760
Don't sell
her short.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.480
When you've played
with Stravinsky...

24:14.480 --> 24:15.760
I know.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.360
It's hard settling
for bits and pieces.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.440
Catch me
if you can.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.880
Shall we begin?

24:21.880 --> 24:25.880
Soft soap.

24:27.640 --> 24:31.640
I imagined this
would be different.

24:31.640 --> 24:35.400
I'm sure Joe appreciates
what you're doing for him.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.400
Probably not.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.800
I spent
my whole life

24:39.800 --> 24:43.120
trying to get him
to notice me.

24:43.120 --> 24:47.000
Even failed a course
to get a reaction.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.360
Nothing.

24:48.360 --> 24:52.360
He takes me
totally for granted.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.440
Lorraine could care less
what he thinks.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.880
You know what?

24:56.880 --> 24:59.280
She's the old man's
favourite.

24:59.280 --> 25:03.280
Maybe it pays
to be selfish.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.640
You think
you'll get over
these things,

25:06.640 --> 25:09.520
but they fester
your whole life.

25:09.520 --> 25:13.520
I've really gotten to know
your father the last few months.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.200
He loves you.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.080
Then why
won't he tell me?

25:19.080 --> 25:21.000
I brought him home

25:21.000 --> 25:23.880
because I thought
he'd see me,

25:23.880 --> 25:27.880
really connect
for the first time.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.800
Do you love me, Daddy?

25:33.800 --> 25:36.080
Then say it.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.400
Cos if you don't,
I'll never forgive you.

25:39.400 --> 25:43.400
Never.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.520
No hardball like
family hardball.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.000
# Two of hearts

25:51.000 --> 25:52.800
# Two hearts
that beat as one

25:52.800 --> 25:54.240
# Two of hearts

25:54.240 --> 25:56.440
# I need you, I need you

25:56.440 --> 25:57.920
# Two of hearts

25:57.920 --> 26:00.120
# Two hearts
that beat as one

26:00.120 --> 26:01.600
# Two of hearts

26:01.600 --> 26:04.520
# Come on, come on... #

26:04.520 --> 26:06.400
Hold your horses,
Pirelli.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.320
You were due here
at 3pm.

26:09.320 --> 26:13.160
Heat of the day,
cool of the night.

26:13.160 --> 26:16.520
What are you doing
to my hedge?

26:16.520 --> 26:19.360
Giving it
a New Wave haircut.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.720
Your razor-sharp wit
pierces my ventricles.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.120
This whole thing
is uneven.

26:25.120 --> 26:29.120
Close enough.
What do you expect
for slave wages?

26:29.160 --> 26:32.800
Middlebury, hmm?
Settled for
imitation Ivy League.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.200
What's your major -
music appreciation?

26:35.200 --> 26:36.320
Business.

26:36.320 --> 26:40.240
Always room
for pretzel hawkers
on the commons.

26:40.240 --> 26:44.000
My dad owns a sand
and gravel operation.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.560
I don't need this job.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.320
I feel sorry for Mrs Craig.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.720
What's that
supposed to mean?

26:49.720 --> 26:52.960
Home with the kid.
You can't pull your weight.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.960
Give me those.

26:54.960 --> 26:58.120
Show you how
it's done in the navy.

26:58.120 --> 27:02.120
# Come on, come on... #

27:03.960 --> 27:05.880
I dig your technique -

27:05.880 --> 27:07.320
non-violent gardening.

27:07.320 --> 27:11.320
Very vegetarian.

27:11.800 --> 27:12.920
Here.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.160
Turn off that noise.

27:15.160 --> 27:19.160
# I need... #

27:19.200 --> 27:20.640
BABY CRIES

27:20.640 --> 27:24.520
Dino doesn't
have the brains
of a dinosaur.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.880
He's clipping hedges
after dark.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.320
He's making mincemeat.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.200
Where have you been?

27:30.200 --> 27:32.600
I drove by
the hospital.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.560
I debated going in,

27:34.560 --> 27:36.000
then came home.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.280
What's wrong with Barbara?

27:37.280 --> 27:41.280
Mark, Pampers!

27:46.960 --> 27:48.680
Luther, how's it going?

27:48.680 --> 27:50.800
OK.

27:50.800 --> 27:54.400
You know I'm supportive
of what you're doing.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.760
Thank you.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.240
Weren't you limiting
your activities in ER
to observation?

27:58.240 --> 28:01.240
No, if I'm needed...

28:01.240 --> 28:04.320
You can't work there
until you're certified.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.360
I'm not doing anything
I'm not trained for.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.520
You have no licence.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.760
Rules.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.920
Unfortunately.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.720
You know medicine
is hands-on.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.520
Otherwise,
what's the point?

28:15.520 --> 28:17.480
Even so, don't
do clinical work

28:17.480 --> 28:20.480
till I've talked
to Dr Auschlander.

28:20.480 --> 28:24.480
OK?

28:29.840 --> 28:33.840
If Victor will oversew
his original excellent suture?

28:34.680 --> 28:37.560
This has to last
a lifetime.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.040
Very good. Excellent.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.800
Jackie, extend the incision
along the afferent limb.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.240
How long?

28:44.240 --> 28:45.000
Two centimetres.

28:45.000 --> 28:45.760
Two centimetres.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.480
Two centimetres.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.560
Good. Very good.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.400
We'll do
the intussusception

28:52.400 --> 28:55.400
of the distal ileum
to form the nipple valve.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.920
I'd like to try
the intuscept-intuss...

28:58.920 --> 29:00.600
Intussusception.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.640
Thanks.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.680
Length of the valve?

29:03.680 --> 29:05.600
Four to five
centimetres.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.440
Jackie, how shall
we secure it?

29:08.440 --> 29:09.920
Auto-suture staples.

29:09.920 --> 29:13.480
That would be my choice.
Please proceed.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.880
Very carefully now.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.200
The valve's
a critical element.

29:17.200 --> 29:21.200
The quality of the patient's life
depend on it.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.800
Goes without saying.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.720
Should never
go without saying.

29:26.720 --> 29:27.880
Good.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.000
Good.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.360
Deftly done.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.000
Dr Kiem...

29:32.000 --> 29:33.600
you're the tops.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.160
You're the coliseum.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.120
Cole Porter?

29:37.120 --> 29:39.880
Exactly. You and I
are simpatico. We're...

29:39.880 --> 29:42.600
You could be
an excellent surgeon.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.920
Thank you.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.680
More concentration
and less bull, please.

29:46.680 --> 29:50.680
Yes, ma'am.

29:50.800 --> 29:54.800
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

29:57.480 --> 29:59.720
Oh.

29:59.720 --> 30:03.720
Look, Ellen.
A milk tanker
and a cattle car.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.320
The whole
kit and caboodle.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.880
Mark, let's talk.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.440
About what?

30:09.440 --> 30:13.440
Turn that thing off!

30:14.520 --> 30:16.880
You've been
underfoot all week!

30:16.880 --> 30:20.880
You have nothing better to do
than watch television

30:21.040 --> 30:23.120
or terrorise
Natasha and Dino.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.360
Nonsense.

30:24.360 --> 30:27.520
You've upset
Barbara's schedule.
You've upset my schedule.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.280
Listen.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.960
This temporary,
premature retirement

30:32.960 --> 30:34.880
is a lot harder
on me than you.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.240
You have to find
something constructive to do.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.200
Take up charity work.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.600
I'll be
a candy striper.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.400
Then teach
or write your memoirs!

30:45.400 --> 30:47.280
Don't be ridiculous.
Memoirs!

30:47.280 --> 30:49.320
What about your hand?

30:49.320 --> 30:51.920
I'm doing
the best I can.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.640
You're not!
You're playing Christmas Day!

30:54.640 --> 30:58.000
Decide why you're home
and do something!

30:58.000 --> 31:00.600
Because this...

31:00.600 --> 31:03.760
..has got to stop!

31:03.760 --> 31:06.320
Oh, great, Ellen!

31:06.320 --> 31:09.560
That milk tanker
was full!

31:09.560 --> 31:13.560
On Saturday nights,
Lorraine and I

31:13.960 --> 31:16.880
waited to see you
before going out.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.400
Oh.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.320
As you kissed us,

31:20.320 --> 31:22.880
I'd smell your aftershave
and Mom's perfume.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.360
Remember?

31:24.360 --> 31:25.920
Hurts.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.400
I know, Daddy.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.280
I know it hurts.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.200
I'll call Dr Fiscus.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.600
He'll come and
give you something.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.600
Here.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.600
Take some more.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.360
Lorraine.

31:42.360 --> 31:46.360
Lorraine will be here
in the morning.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.000
Lorraine.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.520
She'll come tomorrow.

31:50.520 --> 31:51.920
She's been busy.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.320
She thinks
you'll live for ever.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.120
Lorraine.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.400
Something to tell you.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.600
Something to tell.

32:01.600 --> 32:05.000
1956.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Wind chimes.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.960
Lennox house.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.080
You. Your mother.

32:11.080 --> 32:15.080
I'm not Lorraine,
damn it.

32:17.440 --> 32:20.160
Katie.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.840
Daddy?

32:22.840 --> 32:26.840
Beautiful baby.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.560
Ellen,
I spilt Swiss Miss

32:40.560 --> 32:44.360
trying to
turn off the TV.

32:44.360 --> 32:46.000
Hello, Dr Craig.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.320
How is hand?

32:47.320 --> 32:49.000
It's fine. Thank you.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.520
Where's my wife?

32:50.520 --> 32:52.520
Mrs Craig
upstairs - baby.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.680
Say moose
and squirrel.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.040
Moose and squirrel.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.160
I thought so.

32:58.160 --> 33:02.160
That how they do it
in the Red Army barracks?

33:02.520 --> 33:04.920
I was not Red Army.

33:04.920 --> 33:08.920
I suppose I'll hear sad songs
about life in the Gulag.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.120
You missed over there.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.600
Excuse me.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.520
You fled
to the right place.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.440
The world's
flotsam and jetsam

33:17.440 --> 33:20.520
have washed into Boston Bay
for three and a half centuries.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.680
Was music teacher.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.000
Leningrad conservatory.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.080
Sign '77
Helsinki petition.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.960
Human rights. Da?

33:28.960 --> 33:31.240
Lost job.

33:31.240 --> 33:34.040
Applied immigrate.
Four years wait.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.640
And now...Boston

33:36.640 --> 33:39.040
working for
distinguished
heart surgeon.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.440
I'm sure you'll soon
find a position

33:42.440 --> 33:44.840
commensurate with
your qualifications.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.360
I no mind.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.360
Maid, music teacher -
makes no difference.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.840
Life is loss.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.280
You no agree?

33:53.280 --> 33:55.840
I do.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.320
For example...

33:57.320 --> 33:58.680
your hand, huh?

33:58.680 --> 34:00.040
Is very sad.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.560
Nonsense.
It's a minor injury.

34:02.560 --> 34:06.560
Besides, I'm spending this time
reflecting on my life.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.679
That's not
an even shine. Here.

34:11.679 --> 34:14.080
Get your back
into it.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.520
Strength with grace.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.679
Control the stroke.

34:17.679 --> 34:21.159
I know you didn't have
Mop And Glo in Moscovy.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.760
Here, you try.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.400
OK. Strength and grace.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.199
Control the stroke.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.880
Now you're plucking
the balalaika.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.320
Morning, dear.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.400
Morning.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.280
I got work to do.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.000
How you doing?

34:37.000 --> 34:38.679
Strength and grace.

34:38.679 --> 34:42.679
Control the stroke.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.080
Dr Craig -

34:45.080 --> 34:46.520
great man.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.960
Knows suffering, huh?

34:47.960 --> 34:51.960
Yeah. He thinks
he invented it.

34:59.280 --> 35:02.840
No respiration,
heartbeat, or pulse.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.920
What do I do?

35:05.920 --> 35:09.920
Nothing.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.320
Funny...

35:13.320 --> 35:17.080
I brought him home
so we could discuss

35:17.080 --> 35:19.280
the things
we never discussed.

35:19.280 --> 35:23.280
It didn't happen.

35:30.160 --> 35:34.160
Goodbye, Daddy.

35:57.880 --> 36:01.880
That's enough.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.200
Luther, I need...

36:09.200 --> 36:10.440
Luther, I need...

36:10.440 --> 36:10.920
What?

36:10.920 --> 36:12.720
What?

36:12.720 --> 36:16.720
And I apologise.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.600
Hi.

36:25.440 --> 36:28.200
I, uh...

36:28.200 --> 36:29.600
..came to apologise.

36:29.600 --> 36:33.160
I should have never
reacted that way.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.800
You know,
unprofessional.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.800
I put off
having that ostomy
for two years.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.080
Lost 40 pounds
and my job.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.000
Tried everything -
diets, steroids.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.880
Even went
to a faith healer.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.720
Doctor said, "If you
don't have the ostomy,

36:49.720 --> 36:52.160
"you'll die."

36:52.160 --> 36:55.000
After the operation,
I felt mutilated.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
I came home and cried
for two weeks.

37:05.400 --> 37:09.400
You know, last year
I was dating this girl.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.800
We both decided
to lose weight.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.480
She did,
and I didn't.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.120
Afterwards,
people told me,

37:17.120 --> 37:19.000
"Hey, it's all right.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
"Forget about it.
Learn to love yourself."

37:23.520 --> 37:26.680
But I was so upset
about losing her.

37:26.680 --> 37:30.680
I became angry
and cynical
and uncooperative.

37:33.160 --> 37:37.160
I really admire you
for accepting who you are.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.600
I showed you mine.
Show me yours.

37:45.960 --> 37:47.000
What?

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Your problem,
your physical deformity.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.400
I showed you mine.
Show me yours.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.520
I'm a doctor.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.560
Don't pull rank.
What's a little cellulite?

37:56.560 --> 37:59.640
Men don't have
cellulite. It's flab.

37:59.640 --> 38:03.000
So show some flab.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.400
I can't.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.120
You can leave
your hat on.

38:06.120 --> 38:09.680
I'm not
wearing a hat.

38:09.680 --> 38:13.000
It's a Randy Newman
song. It's a joke.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.440
Boy, are you square.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.240
Well...oblong.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.200
Oh, very funny.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.800
I'm waiting.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.400
I can't.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.720
You know
the old saying -

38:24.720 --> 38:28.240
you can run,
but you can't hide.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.240
Especially
from yourself.

38:30.240 --> 38:34.240
I don't see why I can't
keep on doing both.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.800
Nurse Rosenthal said
you were looking for me.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.920
How was the exam?

38:58.920 --> 39:00.840
I didn't take it.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.280
Why not?

39:02.280 --> 39:05.600
Dr Westphall forbid me
from doing hands-on

39:05.600 --> 39:08.240
until I get
into the PA programme.

39:08.240 --> 39:11.840
No reason
for not taking the test.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.800
The orderlies
hate me.

39:13.800 --> 39:17.800
The doctors won't let me
do what I know how to do.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.920
I'm behind
in my homework.

39:20.920 --> 39:24.200
I'm dead
on my feet.

39:24.200 --> 39:28.200
Feels like
I don't belong.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
I don't have six years
to waste on a pipe dream.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
I'll see what I can do
about speeding things along.

39:38.760 --> 39:42.000
You're promising
swimming lessons,
and I'm drowning.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.080
Patience.
That's all I ask.

39:44.080 --> 39:48.080
Forget it. I quit.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.000
What are you doing?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.880
Writing my memoirs.

40:01.880 --> 40:03.200
Why?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.600
For the love
of Mike.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.480
It was your idea.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.400
"By Mark Craig, MD."

40:09.400 --> 40:12.520
I can't get started
without a title.

40:12.520 --> 40:15.600
What about Surgeon?

40:15.600 --> 40:17.000
Too generic.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.880
I can just picture
the dust jacket.

40:19.880 --> 40:23.080
White glossy stock,
big black letters.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.640
Surgeon! With
an exclamation point.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.400
My life isn't
a Broadway musical.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.800
I'm afraid
with this hand,

40:30.800 --> 40:33.200
typing's
out of the question.

40:33.200 --> 40:36.600
I'll rough it out
on the Dictaphone.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.040
Whatever you write,

40:38.040 --> 40:40.440
I'm sure
it'll be brilliant,

40:40.440 --> 40:42.040
provocative and controversial.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.800
I've always wanted
to have my views known,

40:45.800 --> 40:48.720
share experiences,
set the record straight.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.760
Good idea. Thank you.

40:50.760 --> 40:53.520
You're welcome.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.800
Don't stay up too late.

40:55.800 --> 40:59.800
No. Sleep tight.

41:02.600 --> 41:06.600
Title, title, title.

41:08.040 --> 41:12.040
Your Heart, My Hands.

41:13.200 --> 41:17.200
Too sentimental.

41:17.480 --> 41:21.000
Cardiac Man.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
Sounds like
a bad documentary.

41:26.920 --> 41:30.920
The Cutting Edge.

41:33.320 --> 41:37.320
A memoir by
Dr Mark Craig, surgeon.

41:38.600 --> 41:42.120
Award-winning surgeon.

41:42.120 --> 41:44.040
Winner of the Cushing

41:44.040 --> 41:46.440
left anterior
descending artery award

41:46.440 --> 41:50.080
and doctor of the year.

41:50.080 --> 41:54.080
Chapter one.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.600
I have to go.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.040
Sorry about
leaving you alone.

42:00.040 --> 42:04.040
That's OK. Lorraine
and her kids are coming.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.360
They'll pick
through his junk -

42:07.360 --> 42:09.720
"He promised me this.
I want that."

42:09.720 --> 42:11.960
They can have it.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.840
What's wrong
with a remembrance?

42:13.840 --> 42:17.040
Right! Daddy's junk
becomes an icon.

42:17.040 --> 42:20.160
What did you expect
to get from this?

42:20.160 --> 42:22.840
Oh, nothing much.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.720
I needed him
to make up

42:25.720 --> 42:27.760
for 30 years of
emotional neglect.

42:27.760 --> 42:31.760
In a matter of days,
at his weakest?

42:32.000 --> 42:35.400
Anyway, he's gone, and
I've still got nothing.

42:35.400 --> 42:39.320
This was about helping him,
easing him into death.

42:39.320 --> 42:41.560
The caring you showed

42:41.560 --> 42:45.320
is worth more than
any Father's Day dinner.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.200
You're supposed
to say that.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.880
You feel empty
inside, right?

42:49.880 --> 42:53.600
Spend time with someone
who knew him.

42:53.600 --> 42:56.080
Always comes
back to my sister...

42:56.080 --> 43:00.080
No, his best friend.
Here, boy.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Why don't you
take Katie for a walk?

43:09.880 --> 43:12.240
Come on, Thor.

43:12.240 --> 43:16.240
Come on, boy.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.520
KNOCK ON DOOR

43:48.520 --> 43:49.200
Can I come in?

43:49.200 --> 43:50.200
Can I come in?

43:50.200 --> 43:51.480
I wanted to talk...

43:51.480 --> 43:55.480
I wanted to talk...

43:59.120 --> 44:02.600
I spent the day
watching a man die
in his home,

44:02.600 --> 44:06.280
an event
we doctors rarely see.

44:06.280 --> 44:08.200
He went the way

44:08.200 --> 44:10.520
we think
we all want to.

44:10.520 --> 44:14.520
Can't always be
that neatly arranged.

44:18.760 --> 44:22.120
Whether a man
dies in his bed

44:22.120 --> 44:25.000
or with tubes
in a hospital

44:25.000 --> 44:28.800
or in a swamp in
the South Pacific,

44:28.800 --> 44:31.960
whether he dies
surrounded
by his family

44:31.960 --> 44:33.400
or absolutely alone,

44:33.400 --> 44:35.280
it makes no difference.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.600
Ultimately, no.

44:36.600 --> 44:40.560
I strive to be
prepared for that moment,

44:40.560 --> 44:42.480
whenever it is.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.840
Easy for you.

44:43.840 --> 44:47.840
As my time shortens,
I fight even harder,

44:47.840 --> 44:51.840
because I'm more scared
of that one second,

44:52.480 --> 44:54.680
that journey,
than anything else.

44:54.680 --> 44:58.680
Where does one
find the courage to face...

45:01.160 --> 45:03.720
When Joe Ewell died,
I thought I saw a light,

45:03.720 --> 45:05.640
a soft light, like mist.

45:05.640 --> 45:09.640
I know what
that light was...

45:09.880 --> 45:13.880
The soul
leaving the body.

45:14.920 --> 45:18.920
Maybe the sun
was in your eyes.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.800
I'd like to believe
in something like that.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.320
Yeah.

45:23.320 --> 45:27.320
We die alone,
that's for sure.

45:27.920 --> 45:31.920
But while we're here,
we're all in this together.

45:34.480 --> 45:38.480
See you later.

45:46.640 --> 46:31.000
TIBETAN BELLS PLAY
