00:56.090 --> 00:59.760
Wow, baby, look.

01:02.630 --> 01:06.167
The furniture, it's in all
the places we asked for it.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.836
- It looks really nice.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.805
I don't think we
need too much change.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.975
This is so much
better than apartment.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.080
I'll go and look around.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.269
- Hey.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.803
- Hi.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.104
Look.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.439
That is a railroad
they talked about.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.740
- Oh yeah.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.609
I hope the noise level
won't be too terrible.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.945
That's the only thing I
worry about in this place.

01:59.787 --> 02:00.588
- Michael.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.458
- Thank you so much
for working hard

02:04.458 --> 02:07.094
so we can afford this big house.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.763
- Anything for you, baby.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.131
There's gonna be so
many wonderful things

02:11.131 --> 02:12.966
that we're going to
do in this house.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.038
- Like all the birthday
parties and anniversaries

02:18.038 --> 02:20.808
that we're going
to celebrate here,

02:20.808 --> 02:25.246
our first candlelight dinner,
our first movie night,

02:25.246 --> 02:27.415
my first promotion at
work since moving in.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.616
- Oh stop being such a showoff.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.784
You love it.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.680
- Get in there!

03:06.520 --> 03:07.355
Come on!

03:09.223 --> 03:10.624
Come on, come on!

03:20.801 --> 03:21.635
- Fuck!

03:36.550 --> 03:38.252
- You suck at tennis.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.587
- Look who's talking.

03:39.587 --> 03:43.190
"Oh look
who's talking."

03:43.190 --> 03:45.926
Whatever, I don't care
if I can play or not.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.996
I just wanna feel like
I'm in a place in my life

03:48.996 --> 03:51.131
where I can play
tennis in my home.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.600
- Yeah, I hear that.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.667
This is nice.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.804
- Thank you.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.306
You know what?

03:58.306 --> 03:59.106
You're welcome to come by any
time you want to practice.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.574
- Cool.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.076
Obviously I need the practice.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.480
Seriously though,
congratulations.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.682
I'm really happy
for you and Lily.

04:08.682 --> 04:09.517
- Thanks.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.721
Let's go inside and get
something cold to drink.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.155
- All right, man, your call.

04:15.155 --> 04:15.989
Let's do it.

04:24.097 --> 04:24.932
Here you go.

04:24.932 --> 04:25.766
- Thanks.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.307
So this is it, huh?

04:35.409 --> 04:36.510
- Everything.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.280
You got a good job,
you got married,

04:40.280 --> 04:41.849
you bought a house.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.150
Pretty soon you're
gonna start a family,

04:43.150 --> 04:46.987
the whole thing, man,
the whole package.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.390
- Yeah, I guess you can
look at it that way,

04:49.390 --> 04:52.092
but I'm looking forward to it.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.093
I want this.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.464
- Good for you, man.

04:56.464 --> 05:00.033
I'm glad to see you're
moving on to the next stage.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.208
Yeah.

05:10.077 --> 05:14.147
I guess it's hard for
me to believe in love.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.819
- I don't know.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.322
I've seen too many people
getting screwed over by love.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.992
It seems like you're
trying to win the lottery.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.093
- Oh come on.

05:27.294 --> 05:31.164
You can't take these
things for granted.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.167
Every single situation
is different.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.205
How did you know?

05:38.205 --> 05:39.573
How did you know
when you met the one?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.008
How did you know
Lily was the one?

05:48.281 --> 05:50.283
- I guess you just know.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.754
You just know.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.322
Great!

05:55.322 --> 05:56.857
Great advice.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.227
Awesome, I'll keep
that in mind.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.562
- I know it's vague,

06:01.562 --> 06:04.898
but it's the only way
I can describe it.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.835
Have faith.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.737
You'll find someone.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.405
- All right, will do.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.574
I'll have faith.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.144
Gotta have faith, right?

06:19.346 --> 06:20.180
Oh man.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.652
- I love you.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.755
- I love you too, Michael.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.502
Babe, I'm thinking about
getting some tenants

07:48.502 --> 07:50.170
for our guest rooms.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.507
What do you mean?

07:53.507 --> 07:56.877
- I think we should rent
out our guest rooms.

07:56.877 --> 08:00.113
It will help us with
the house payment.

08:01.515 --> 08:05.418
Also, it will be more people
for me to interact with.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.623
Otherwise, I would
just feel so lonely.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.831
- I'm so sorry.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.002
I know you gave up
so much to move here.

08:23.403 --> 08:24.905
- Stop teasing me.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.375
- Look, I'm gonna
do everything I can

08:28.375 --> 08:32.412
to make sure that you
feel happy and at home.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.615
If this is something
you wanna do,

08:34.615 --> 08:36.448
then I'm okay with it.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.020
- Thank you so much, love.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.121
You're so sweet.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.658
I'm so sweet, I'm so sweet!

08:46.026 --> 08:47.227
Oh, Michael, stop!

08:47.227 --> 08:48.061
Stop!

08:49.029 --> 08:50.731
Stop!

08:50.731 --> 08:52.866
Ow.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.047
Hi, how are you?

09:40.047 --> 09:40.881
- Hi.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.222
- Yes, just myself,

09:50.390 --> 09:53.627
but I have two dog,
sweet cat, and a pig.

09:57.765 --> 10:01.001
I'm hoping to bring
them over here too.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.972
- Okay, but did you read the
email I sent you yesterday

10:04.972 --> 10:06.239
saying no pets?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.776
- But they are so cute.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.510
I call my pig Pigget.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.080
Funny, right?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.216
You will change your mind,

10:16.216 --> 10:17.718
once you see them.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.320
- Okay, thank you.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.089
Thank you for coming.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.460
Are you moving by yourself?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.295
- Yeah.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.999
I do have a boyfriend, sort of.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.369
Maybe sometimes he
wants to come see me,

10:36.369 --> 10:41.341
but I want to ask, do you
have an open relationship?

10:41.341 --> 10:43.443
- Okay, I'm married.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.845
- I know, I know.

10:46.346 --> 10:50.150
I just want to ask, how do
you feel about switching?

10:56.089 --> 10:56.924
- Yeah.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.927
It would be very exciting.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.494
I saw your wedding
picture on the wall

11:01.494 --> 11:03.663
and you two are very cute.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.199
- I'm sorry.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.968
I'm not used to that.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.742
Well, I guess you do not
know what you are missing.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.752
- Yes, I love to shoot.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.291
- Oh my god.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.964
Please, there's no smoking rule.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.700
It's organic.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.668
- I'm sorry.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.436
You have to leave right now.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.537
I'm so sorry.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.841
- What a pussy.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.613
- Well, darling, far away.

11:58.986 --> 11:59.820
- Around.

12:03.623 --> 12:07.460
- Do you go to school
or you're working?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.295
- No.

12:11.164 --> 12:11.999
- No.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.105
- Maybe.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.407
- Great.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.113
Do you have any
jobs or you're...

12:28.515 --> 12:29.416
- A little.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.454
- I'm just trying to
make sure you can pay,

12:34.454 --> 12:37.124
afford the monthly rent.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.027
- How many yes or
nos does it take?

12:56.709 --> 12:57.544
- Hi.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.378
- Hi.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.646
I'm Oxana.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.714
I'm here for the
tenant interview.

13:01.714 --> 13:02.850
Are you Lily?

13:02.850 --> 13:03.683
- Yes I am.

13:03.683 --> 13:04.517
Thanks for coming.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.618
Come in.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.619
- Thank you.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.794
- This way please.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.795
- Thank you.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.706
- Tell me about yourself.

13:26.706 --> 13:29.076
- I'm foreign student.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.577
My school is near here,

13:30.577 --> 13:34.414
so I'm looking for a nice
place near here to live.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.616
- Great.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.052
Is a single bedroom
okay for you?

13:39.052 --> 13:40.520
- Yes, single bedroom's fine.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.722
I don't need much.

13:42.722 --> 13:43.623
- That's great.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.993
That's very simple.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.460
Do you want something to drink?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.496
- No, no, I'm okay.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.831
Thank you very much.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.867
By the way, you
have a lovely home.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.937
I really like the warm
and cozy atmosphere.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.205
- Thank you.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.739
Do you want me to
show you around?

13:59.739 --> 14:01.942
- Yes, please, that'd be great.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.748
- The upstairs.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.117
- Is that where all
the bedrooms are?

14:23.096 --> 14:24.031
Thank you, Lily.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.332
Thank you for the good time.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.799
- You're welcome.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.069
I'll give you a call as
soon as I make my decision.

14:29.069 --> 14:29.903
Thank you.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.144
- Goodbye.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.146
Thank you.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.013
See you.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.800
Hey,
Oxana, how are you?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.769
Hi, I'm
good, thank you.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.371
Do you need any help?

15:04.371 --> 15:06.873
- No, I'm okay, I only
have this luggage.

15:06.873 --> 15:07.774
- Oh great.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.980
Come here, sit.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.813
Michael.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.787
Michael, this is
Oxana, our new tenant.

15:20.787 --> 15:21.989
- Hi, I'm Michael.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.090
Welcome to our home.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.391
- Hi, nice to meet you.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.658
I'm Oxana.

15:25.658 --> 15:29.162
Thank you for accepting
me into your home.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.573
Hi, Julie.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.612
- Michael.

15:50.217 --> 15:51.985
Michael, come over.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.753
This is Julie, the other tenant.

15:53.753 --> 15:54.687
- Hi.

15:54.687 --> 15:55.488
Wow, all at the same time, huh?

15:55.488 --> 15:56.323
I'm Michael.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.190
Nice to meet you.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.791
- Nice to meet you.

16:16.209 --> 16:20.013
I'm surprised, your Chinese
is better than mine.

16:28.888 --> 16:33.060
(Lily, Michael,
and Julie laughing)

16:37.630 --> 16:39.266
Sorry.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.733
- Hi.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.202
My name's Julie.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.070
You're very pretty.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.437
- Thank you very much.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.438
I'm Oxana.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.539
It's nice to meet you.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.208
- Yeah, nice to meet you too.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.309
Where are you from?

16:49.309 --> 16:50.943
You have an accent.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.512
- I'm from Germany.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.515
- Oh, that's so cool.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.433
- Where do you
pick your tenants?

17:13.433 --> 17:15.801
- It didn't occur
to me until now.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.361
- So silly.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.863
- No, your husband is so cool.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.031
He has a good job.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.401
You have a great house together.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.802
He's so talented.

18:30.277 --> 18:33.346
- Oh sorry, I forgot
I was talking Chinese.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.315
I was
just telling Julie

18:35.315 --> 18:37.350
that don't praise
Michael so much.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.851
He's getting more
and more arrogant.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.253
(Lily, Julie, and
Oxana laughing)

18:40.253 --> 18:41.388
- Don't worry about it.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.655
I don't mind.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.057
Please speak however
you are comfortable.

18:45.057 --> 18:48.861
- I just feel bad
if I leave you out.

18:48.861 --> 18:52.499
Next time I have to use
proper English.

18:54.234 --> 18:57.704
You two, you seem like
the perfect couple.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.138
How did you meet?

19:00.407 --> 19:02.442
- It is actually a coincident.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.944
I was working the
same company with him.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.880
It was an oversea
branch in China.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.382
Oh great.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.319
- One day he just came to
our town on a business trip,

19:12.319 --> 19:14.721
and that was how
we met.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.423
- She is so lucky.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.024
You meet such a great guy

19:18.024 --> 19:20.460
due to such random
circumstances.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.828
- I agree.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.563
I wish I would be this lucky.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.766
- Oh, now stop, stop
talking about me, girls.

19:26.766 --> 19:30.437
I really wanna know
more about you guys.

19:30.437 --> 19:33.373
What makes you come
here and study?

19:34.941 --> 19:38.345
- I guess I wanted to
see a bigger world,

19:39.812 --> 19:42.382
and I know there's a world here

19:42.382 --> 19:45.385
with many different
types of people.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.819
- Oh great, yeah,

19:46.819 --> 19:48.555
there are different kinds
of people out there.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.691
- I know it would
be really hard to.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.694
But the sun is so
attractive here.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.062
- Oh yes.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.399
The Californian sun
is world-famous.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.601
That's why I came here too.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.103
I bet that's not why
you came here though.

20:04.103 --> 20:04.937
- Oh, no.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.384
- Sorry, we're talking
about Asian women,

20:17.384 --> 20:18.551
we're scared about the sun,

20:18.551 --> 20:19.852
because we don't wanna get tan,

20:19.852 --> 20:24.190
and we just wanna remain
this pale, fair skin.

20:24.190 --> 20:28.060
(Julie, Oxana,
and Lily laughing)

20:28.060 --> 20:29.829
- Yes, I think I am
a little too white,

20:29.829 --> 20:32.164
so I think I would
like to get darker.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.100
(Julie, Oxana,
and Lily laughing)

20:34.100 --> 20:35.368
- Seriously, girls,

20:35.368 --> 20:38.438
I came here because I
wanna get a good job

20:38.438 --> 20:40.373
and make a lot of money,

20:40.373 --> 20:44.544
maybe even meet a guy from
California and get married.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.883
- Hey, this is the
land of opportunity.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.619
- I think you are right,

20:52.619 --> 20:55.555
plenty of opportunities,
including love.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.624
- Yes, it is true,
but you know what?

20:57.624 --> 21:00.493
When I first came here,
I was just so lonely.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.662
It was just so hard to adjust.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.067
- Because back home I had
a very, very stable job,

21:08.067 --> 21:11.638
and it's just like
working, you stay busy,

21:11.638 --> 21:13.973
and I had so many friends

21:13.973 --> 21:16.208
and there were always
activities going on.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.078
Here it's like
nothing going on here.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.246
- It is.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.281
The nightclubs
close really early,

21:22.281 --> 21:25.352
and after 7:00, lots
of stores close.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.287
As soon as the sun goes down,

21:28.287 --> 21:31.057
all the people don't
go out anymore.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.192
It's a little bit boring.

21:33.192 --> 21:34.694
- Interesting.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.363
Maybe I will have to go
to your country to study.

21:36.363 --> 21:40.232
(Lily, Julie, and
Oxana laughing)

21:40.232 --> 21:42.802
- Oh, hey, we gotta go.

21:42.802 --> 21:43.870
The movie's starting
in half an hour.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.238
Let's go let's go let's go.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.206
Let's go let's go.

21:57.216 --> 21:58.351
- Bye, Michael.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.420
Dinner's in the refrigerator.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.220
- Okay.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.490
- Bye.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.222
- Good morning.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.357
- Guten morgen.

22:40.693 --> 22:41.628
- I have to get going,

22:41.628 --> 22:43.896
but I'll see you two later.

22:43.896 --> 22:44.731
Bye.

22:44.731 --> 22:45.598
- Bye.

23:02.014 --> 23:02.849
- Hi.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.385
How is everything going?

23:06.385 --> 23:09.689
- Everything is good, thank you.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.159
Yes, I did.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.094
- Oh, let me fix you some tea.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.429
Thank you very much.

23:27.607 --> 23:28.441
- Here you go.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.109
Thank you.

23:32.011 --> 23:35.882
- If you ever need anything,
please let me know.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.485
- Thank you very much.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.318
- Yeah.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.555
It's just so nice
to have you here.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.956
I don't feel lonely again.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.192
- It must be quite a change.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.595
- Yeah, at least for me.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.531
Sometimes it gets
really difficult.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.334
I love him.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.273
Five years ago since
the first time we met,

24:01.273 --> 24:04.410
and then we started
long-distance relationship.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.579
That was really difficult.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.281
We've been through a lot.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.883
- Yeah, but you did it anyway.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.051
I admire your courage.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.353
Thank you.

24:14.353 --> 24:15.622
He's a great guy.

24:15.622 --> 24:16.989
I trust him.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.257
- Ah, it must be nice

24:18.257 --> 24:21.193
to have that kind of
trust in your life.

24:23.496 --> 24:26.398
- You, do you have
someone special?

24:26.398 --> 24:28.701
- No, not right now.

24:28.701 --> 24:32.905
I think this will be a
new beginning for me.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.741
I move around too much,

24:34.741 --> 24:37.209
so I never really
have time to settle

24:37.209 --> 24:40.046
and make a connection
with anyone.

24:41.814 --> 24:42.749
- Interesting.

24:42.749 --> 24:45.117
Have you been to lots of places?

24:45.117 --> 24:46.753
- Some places.

24:46.753 --> 24:50.156
I tend to get bored when I
stay in one place too long,

24:50.156 --> 24:52.058
and I like discovering,

24:53.292 --> 24:56.829
discovering people
and places, food.

25:00.399 --> 25:01.668
I better do some studies

25:01.668 --> 25:04.236
because I have a test
in class later today.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.204
Great.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.673
Nice talking to you.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.140
- If you need something,
just come knock on my door.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.577
Of course, yeah.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.410
- Bye.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.962
- Hey, hi, Julie.

27:09.962 --> 27:10.797
What's up?

27:13.666 --> 27:15.067
- You're always in
this little room

27:15.067 --> 27:17.269
in all your spare time.

27:17.269 --> 27:20.873
I'm just curious what
you're doing in here.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.710
- I guess it's a hobby of mine.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.212
I like to compose music.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.680
- I didn't know that.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.749
That's really great.

27:29.749 --> 27:33.019
- I'm sorry it's
such a mess in here.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.687
I was gonna try and
fix up my computer,

27:34.687 --> 27:36.355
maybe get a new one.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.760
But hey, do you wanna
see how the stuff works?

27:40.760 --> 27:43.195
- Yeah, yeah, I
would love to see it.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.698
Come on in.

28:48.694 --> 28:51.163
- You are really talented.

28:51.163 --> 28:51.998
Thanks.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.332
You're too kind.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.306
- I should probably go.

29:00.306 --> 29:03.810
You got so much
creative stuff to do.

29:03.810 --> 29:06.112
- Don't worry about it.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.780
- I'll see you later.

29:07.780 --> 29:08.614
Bye.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.020
Thanks for showing me.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.587
I'll see you later.

30:39.005 --> 30:39.838
- Oh, hi.

30:40.706 --> 30:41.540
- Hey.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.376
Are you okay?

30:44.376 --> 30:47.613
- Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.081
- Yeah.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.283
Is something bothering you?

30:51.283 --> 30:52.518
- Yeah.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.554
I've been talking to
my mom on the internet.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.390
Sorry if I get a
little emotional.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.060
I really miss her.

31:03.062 --> 31:03.996
- I know.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.565
I can understand how that feels.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.969
Why don't you go visit her?

31:12.138 --> 31:15.407
- Actually, I've been
thinking about that,

31:15.407 --> 31:17.977
just see how she's doing.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.478
Why not?

31:20.913 --> 31:22.982
- I've just been
worrying about Michael,

31:22.982 --> 31:24.883
because no one's gonna
take care of him.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.652
- He will be fine.

31:26.652 --> 31:27.786
He's big boy.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.155
He can take care of himself.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.891
- I guess you're right.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.526
Yeah, he's a big boy.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.863
I'm sorry I have to say this.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.999
- Oh, no, no, don't be.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.434
Glad I can help you.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.203
- Thank you, Oxana.

31:44.203 --> 31:45.137
You're so sweet.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.438
- Hey, honey.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.007
Is there something wrong?

32:21.007 --> 32:23.342
You've been quiet all night.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.945
Hey.

32:26.945 --> 32:27.779
Tell me.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.916
Is something bothering you?

32:39.225 --> 32:40.059
- Honey.

32:40.926 --> 32:43.862
I hope you understand this.

32:43.862 --> 32:46.965
I appreciate everything
you have done,

32:46.965 --> 32:49.968
and I'm really happy
being with you,

32:51.537 --> 32:52.371
but

32:54.040 --> 32:56.675
it's just this loneliness.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.410
It's too much for me.

33:01.047 --> 33:04.216
It's just so
overwhelming, everything.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.219
I can't stand it anymore.

33:12.358 --> 33:16.195
- I can't imagine how
hard it must be for you.

33:18.730 --> 33:22.468
Hey, why don't you go
back home for a while

33:22.468 --> 33:24.303
and visit your mother?

33:33.312 --> 33:34.146
Really?

33:35.714 --> 33:36.982
You don't mind?

33:38.584 --> 33:39.885
- Not at all.

33:39.885 --> 33:42.788
I think it'll be good for you.

33:42.788 --> 33:45.091
We can think of it
as a little vacation

33:45.091 --> 33:47.025
away from our marriage.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.401
- You're so silly, Michael.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.808
Do you know how much I love you?

34:06.578 --> 34:08.914
You don't understand.

34:08.914 --> 34:10.416
- I do understand.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.286
I want you to have a great time,

34:16.722 --> 34:19.391
and don't worry too
much about me, okay?

35:41.340 --> 35:42.241
Hey there.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.575
You're still up?

35:45.177 --> 35:48.680
- What are you doing
there by the fire?

35:48.680 --> 35:49.515
- I don't know.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.517
Is it strange?

35:52.784 --> 35:54.953
because it's summer.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.489
- I guess it is
a little strange,

35:57.489 --> 35:58.990
but I like this fire.

36:17.409 --> 36:18.910
- Yeah, of course,

36:20.279 --> 36:24.483
but it's nice giving myself
a moment to be alone.

36:28.254 --> 36:30.622
- As strange as it sounds,

36:30.622 --> 36:33.024
I have this sense of freedom.

36:35.627 --> 36:39.631
I haven't slept alone
since we've moved in here.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.901
Now it just suddenly feels like

36:42.901 --> 36:46.238
I don't have to worry
about her anymore.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.641
- It's strange.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.811
Should I let you be then?

36:52.811 --> 36:54.780
- Oh no, I didn't
mean it like that.

36:54.780 --> 36:55.781
Feel free to stay.

37:06.492 --> 37:07.893
I hope you don't mind me saying,

37:07.893 --> 37:09.961
but you look really nice.

37:12.030 --> 37:16.201
- I guess it must be
the fire.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.872
- What do you like to do
during your free time?

37:20.872 --> 37:22.874
- It depends on my mood.

37:24.109 --> 37:27.346
- What about when you
have a lonely mood?

37:30.148 --> 37:32.384
- I write down my thoughts.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.119
In a diary?

37:34.119 --> 37:36.788
- No, not really, just thoughts,

37:37.956 --> 37:40.459
and then I burn
them right after.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.561
You don't like to keep them?

37:44.029 --> 37:48.334
I don't trust myself enough
to keep secrets around.

37:48.334 --> 37:49.535
What if I die

37:49.535 --> 37:52.137
and people go through my stuff

37:52.137 --> 37:57.042
and they're gonna find
out I'm a freak

37:57.042 --> 37:59.177
- You're a private
person, I suppose.

37:59.177 --> 38:00.178
- Yes, I am.

38:02.013 --> 38:06.017
Another thing I sometimes do
is a deep breathing exercise.

38:06.017 --> 38:09.488
It can really help you to sleep.

38:10.456 --> 38:11.523
I could use something like that.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.024
- Yeah, of course.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.727
This is how I do it.

38:18.229 --> 38:21.166
You'll want to relax
your shoulders,

38:21.166 --> 38:22.401
and then you start from here.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.577
Your turn.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.117
Yeah, very good.

38:39.117 --> 38:42.421
Now you just need to be
more fluid and more relaxed.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.162
You see?

38:53.632 --> 38:56.702
Watching you do it
relaxes me already.

38:56.702 --> 39:00.205
- Then I guess it's
time to say goodnight.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.273
- Goodnight, Oxana.

39:02.273 --> 39:03.609
Thanks for all your help.

39:03.609 --> 39:04.510
Of course.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.409
- All right.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.058
Hey, are you okay?

40:28.226 --> 40:29.360
- Yeah, I'm fine.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.195
Why?

40:31.396 --> 40:32.898
- I don't know, man.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.299
It seems like you've been
distracted all morning.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.401
No, I'm fine.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.037
- Yeah, I'm sure.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.439
- All right.

40:42.941 --> 40:43.742
So lunch?

40:45.176 --> 40:46.678
- Yeah, of course.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.249
Fast food, ramen, pad Thai?

40:55.521 --> 40:58.289
Why don't we try
something different today?

41:08.033 --> 41:11.603
You're right, this is
kind of refreshing.

41:11.603 --> 41:14.439
It's a little warm,
but it's nice.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.809
- Isn't it interesting how
you can discover something

41:17.809 --> 41:20.579
you didn't know
was there before?

41:21.613 --> 41:23.081
- Yeah, I guess.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.093
Hey, are you sure
you're okay today?

41:35.093 --> 41:36.762
You're acting weird.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.231
No, I'm fine.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.833
- You don't have to
stress it or anything,

41:41.833 --> 41:45.136
but you can talk
to me about things.

41:45.136 --> 41:46.805
- No really, I'm fine.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.373
Anyways, I think we should
get back to the office.

41:48.373 --> 41:51.042
- Wait wait wait, hold up.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.443
Something is up.

41:52.443 --> 41:53.879
Come on, man, spit it out.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.346
- Really, there's
really nothing.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.683
- Come on, man, spit it out!

41:59.651 --> 42:00.619
- All right.

42:02.287 --> 42:03.354
Have you ever

42:04.823 --> 42:07.993
unexpectedly fantasized
about someone?

42:11.663 --> 42:13.665
- Just like I asked you.

42:15.066 --> 42:18.269
- Yeah, sure, I
fantasize about it.

42:18.269 --> 42:21.272
I fantasize about
it all the time,

42:21.272 --> 42:23.909
but what's the unexpected part?

42:23.909 --> 42:28.647
- I didn't expect to be
fantasizing about this person.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.586
- One of my tenants.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.860
- She's really different.

42:43.762 --> 42:46.031
It's making me
really uncomfortable.

42:46.031 --> 42:49.467
I thought people only
fantasized when they were bored,

42:49.467 --> 42:51.436
and I'm not bored.

42:51.436 --> 42:54.572
- I don't think it
works that way, man.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.976
I think you can fantasize
whenever you want.

42:57.976 --> 43:01.780
It's not like you
cheated on your wife.

43:01.780 --> 43:02.614
Wait, did you?

43:02.614 --> 43:04.149
- No.

43:04.149 --> 43:06.484
- Then you're all good, man.

43:06.484 --> 43:07.753
Fantasize away.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.656
What's confusing?

43:13.258 --> 43:14.760
- Have you ever
been in a situation

43:14.760 --> 43:19.097
where you read this quote
and you say to yourself,

43:19.097 --> 43:21.099
"Yeah, that's my motto,"

43:22.300 --> 43:25.603
but then later you
read another quote

43:25.603 --> 43:28.774
and it's equally as
powerful and inspiring,

43:28.774 --> 43:29.941
and then you're just confused

43:29.941 --> 43:32.644
as to what your motto should be?

43:33.544 --> 43:35.546
Are you serious?

43:36.782 --> 43:40.051
- That's the weirdest
analogy I've ever heard.

43:41.687 --> 43:45.623
- You just compared women
to inspirational quotes.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.525
Who does that?

43:47.525 --> 43:50.729
Look, I can understand
comparing women to cars

43:50.729 --> 43:52.664
or your favorite food,

43:52.664 --> 43:55.967
but inspirational quotes,
that's just weird.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.103
- I don't know, it's
the best I can do.

43:58.103 --> 43:59.705
Anyways, never mind.

43:59.705 --> 44:03.308
- No, look, I'm not
judging you or anything.

44:05.510 --> 44:07.846
I've never heard
that one before.

44:07.846 --> 44:10.248
That must be a oriental thing.

44:10.248 --> 44:11.549
Shut up.

44:11.549 --> 44:13.318
- No, I'm serious, man.

44:13.318 --> 44:15.887
Look, I'm just joking.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.356
I've never heard
that one before.

44:18.356 --> 44:20.992
You're just gonna have to watch
yourself a little bit, okay?

44:20.992 --> 44:22.160
- Yeah, I know that.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.029
With Lily gone and
these two under my roof,

44:24.029 --> 44:27.298
I have to watch
myself constantly,

44:27.298 --> 44:29.000
and you know I'm not like that.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.268
- Yeah, I know
you're not like that,

44:30.268 --> 44:31.937
but I'm just saying,

44:34.740 --> 44:37.175
you never know
when it'll strike.

44:39.477 --> 44:41.246
- The perfect moment.

44:43.915 --> 44:47.152
The moment when the
only thing stopping you

44:47.152 --> 44:49.755
is your own willpower,

44:49.755 --> 44:53.091
and that willpower can
go either way, man.

44:53.091 --> 44:54.826
I'm just saying,

44:54.826 --> 44:58.797
that moment is the
hardest thing to face.

44:58.797 --> 45:01.399
It's like you find a bag of cash

45:02.667 --> 45:05.003
just lying in the
middle of nowhere.

45:05.003 --> 45:06.104
Are you gonna do the right thing

45:06.104 --> 45:08.306
or are you gonna take it?

45:08.306 --> 45:09.741
- Lunch is over.

45:09.741 --> 45:11.642
Let's go back.

45:11.642 --> 45:13.979
- All right, it's your call.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.895
Julie.

46:03.895 --> 46:04.996
Why did
you do that to me?

46:04.996 --> 46:06.731
Julie.

46:06.731 --> 46:07.665
Julie.

46:11.036 --> 46:12.437
I worked so hard.

46:13.338 --> 46:14.272
Julie.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.107
- You just leave me like this.

46:22.413 --> 46:23.248
- Julie.

46:27.953 --> 46:28.786
Julie.

46:31.722 --> 46:32.991
Julie, wake up.

46:36.694 --> 46:37.528
What happened?

46:37.528 --> 46:38.363
Are you okay?

46:38.363 --> 46:39.797
Did you get hurt?

46:42.100 --> 46:42.934
- Yeah.

46:44.669 --> 46:47.605
Yeah, Michael, my
heart is hurting.

46:51.009 --> 46:52.343
He broke it off.

46:53.444 --> 46:55.881
After three years together.

46:55.881 --> 47:00.051
He just couldn't handle
the long distance anymore.

47:07.725 --> 47:08.659
I'm so sad.

47:10.595 --> 47:12.763
I can't focus on anything.

47:13.598 --> 47:16.301
I don't know what to do.

47:16.301 --> 47:18.203
- Don't worry.

47:18.203 --> 47:19.938
Things will get better.

47:19.938 --> 47:22.373
Hey, you're a strong woman,

47:22.373 --> 47:24.542
and you're going to
get through this.

47:26.011 --> 47:27.913
Yeah, I know so.

47:27.913 --> 47:28.746
Trust me.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.782
- Thank you, Michael.

47:31.782 --> 47:33.018
You're so nice.

47:34.652 --> 47:36.654
You're so nice, Michael.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.458
- Let's get you
some water, okay?

47:40.458 --> 47:42.393
And then you can go to bed.

47:42.393 --> 47:43.895
I'm gonna get a cup.

47:43.895 --> 47:46.731
- Michael Michael Michael
Michael Michael Michael,

47:46.731 --> 47:47.565
don't go.

47:47.565 --> 47:48.799
Make me feel good.

47:48.799 --> 47:50.936
Make me feel good,
Michael, please.

47:50.936 --> 47:52.603
Make me feel good.

47:52.603 --> 47:54.839
Please make me
feel good, Michael.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.641
Make me feel good.

47:56.641 --> 47:58.509
Make me feel good, Michael.

47:58.509 --> 48:00.711
Michael, make me feel good.

48:01.846 --> 48:03.348
Make me feel good.

48:04.682 --> 48:05.516
Michael.

48:06.551 --> 48:09.420
Will you make me feel good?

48:09.420 --> 48:12.423
Michael, make me
feel good, Michael.

48:14.325 --> 48:16.594
Make me feel good, Michael.

48:16.594 --> 48:18.997
- Here, why don't you sit up.

48:21.967 --> 48:23.701
All right, come here.

48:25.036 --> 48:28.239
All right, take
deep breaths, okay,

48:28.239 --> 48:29.340
deep breaths.

48:31.676 --> 48:33.644
Just think about your breathing.

51:49.707 --> 51:50.541
- Yeah.

52:13.398 --> 52:16.000
I didn't think I hear anything.

52:17.302 --> 52:19.570
- I was playing in silence.

52:21.672 --> 52:23.908
I didn't wanna wake anyone.

52:30.181 --> 52:33.251
I want to know what
you were playing.

52:34.885 --> 52:37.388
- Yeah, but it's gonna
be really quiet because--

52:37.388 --> 52:40.891
- Oh no no, it's okay,
you can play in silence.

52:40.891 --> 52:44.662
I can follow the keys
and hear it in my head.

53:43.421 --> 53:45.823
I saw what you did for Julie.

53:46.691 --> 53:48.293
That was very nice.

53:50.961 --> 53:54.131
- I'm really not
that much of a saint.

53:56.901 --> 53:59.904
You have proven
something with this.

54:02.039 --> 54:06.043
- Maybe it was more just
a matter of preference.

54:13.518 --> 54:15.353
You're not gonna believe this,

54:15.353 --> 54:16.954
even if I tell you.

54:23.093 --> 54:23.894
- Try me.

54:32.703 --> 54:35.039
It's okay, you can trust me.

54:36.173 --> 54:39.243
Besides, nobody else is here.

54:39.243 --> 54:40.345
It's just us.

54:49.554 --> 54:51.889
- I had a fantasy about you.

54:59.630 --> 55:00.998
Yeah.

55:03.267 --> 55:04.101
- Tell me.

55:11.942 --> 55:12.877
- At first,

55:14.111 --> 55:17.715
I was running my fingers
through your hair,

55:19.650 --> 55:23.253
and then along your
face, across your body.

55:34.031 --> 55:36.367
- Then you get closer to me,

55:37.568 --> 55:40.638
and I feel your lips
with my fingertips.

55:50.247 --> 55:51.749
- Not a whole lot.

56:00.691 --> 56:03.594
- I want to know
what that is like.

56:08.332 --> 56:10.635
I want to experience
your fantasy.

57:09.660 --> 57:11.428
Is this what you saw?

57:20.004 --> 57:22.507
- It's really cold out,

57:22.507 --> 57:24.709
and it's getting late.

57:24.709 --> 57:26.010
I think you should go to bed,

57:26.010 --> 57:28.178
and I'm gonna do the same.

57:32.583 --> 57:34.519
- Good night, Michael.

57:34.519 --> 57:35.586
- Good night.

58:59.436 --> 59:01.639
Wait, maybe we should stop,

59:03.440 --> 59:05.242
before it's too late.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:13.210
- Harder.

01:00:14.779 --> 01:00:16.346
- I don't wanna hurt you.

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:18.548
- That's okay, I want you to.

01:00:34.699 --> 01:00:35.900
You're so sweet.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.801
Look at me.

01:04:42.947 --> 01:04:44.148
- Hey!

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:46.016
- Jeez, Dale, what's
wrong with you?

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:49.119
- Sorry, man, you
forgot these files.

01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:52.990
- Yeah.

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.924
- Thanks.

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:55.725
Are you okay?

01:04:58.095 --> 01:04:59.529
What gives, man?

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:02.132
We were gonna go get some
pastrami sandwiches after work.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:03.800
- Not tonight, Dale.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:08.238
I'm fine.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.373
- Dude, you need your wife back.

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:10.440
You're acting weird.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.808
- No.

01:05:11.808 --> 01:05:13.910
No no, just leave me alone.

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.146
- All right, man, your call.

01:05:16.146 --> 01:05:16.981
Your call.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:23.287
Your call!

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:04.828
- Sit, please.

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:06.396
Food will be ready.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:13.603
You're cooking?

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:14.438
- Of course.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:15.572
I hope you like it.

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:17.974
I haven't cooked for a while.

01:06:37.061 --> 01:06:39.063
Here, have a strawberry.

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:47.204
- I've been worried sick.

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:50.207
I thought something
happened to you.

01:06:53.877 --> 01:06:55.412
- I'm sorry.

01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:56.913
Please forgive me.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:01.885
Give me your phone.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.888
Come on,
give it, give it.

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:05.955
- No.

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:06.790
- Give me your phone.

01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:11.161
- Please.

01:07:21.205 --> 01:07:22.206
- My number.

01:07:22.206 --> 01:07:23.907
Now you can track me down.

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:24.808
- I'm not gonna track you down.

01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:26.943
- Forgive me, please.

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:27.777
Please.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.115
Please.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:33.750
Please.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:34.684
You smiled.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.388
I love your smile.

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.830
Can I ask a favor?

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:48.198
- Okay.

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:52.369
I want to see
what's around here,

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.871
but the public
transportation is so bad

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:57.274
I cannot go anywhere.

01:07:57.274 --> 01:07:59.809
- Sure, I could show
you some places.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:23.300
- What were you thinking
about during this past day?

01:08:24.968 --> 01:08:27.337
- I was worried about you.

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:29.839
I didn't know where you were.

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.575
I couldn't reach you.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.944
I thought maybe you left

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.546
after what happened between us.

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:44.754
- Because I care about you.

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:48.492
I thought I would never
get to see you again.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:50.960
I thought

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.264
you had just

01:08:54.264 --> 01:08:55.098
left.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.836
- How could I leave
within one day?

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:01.438
- I don't know.

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:03.372
I panicked, and my mind

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.711
goes weird places when I panic.

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:15.484
- What is one thing you
want from me right now?

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.791
I'll make it up to you
for making you worry sick.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.328
Anything, anything you want.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:48.285
Now is your chance.

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:56.646
What's going on behind
those eyes of yours?

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:58.482
- You.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.351
It's all about you.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.153
Your eyes, hair, lips,

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:07.957
your body light.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:16.833
I'm so torn.

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:21.004
I don't know what to do.

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.507
- Lay by me.

01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:24.340
What?

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.174
- Please.

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:38.021
- I'm so defenseless
against you.

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:43.092
- It's a statement.

01:12:49.265 --> 01:12:50.099
- Yeah.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:55.405
- I want to feel your
lips and your tongue.

01:12:57.273 --> 01:12:59.375
- I've never done that before.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:00.376
- Me either.

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:48.458
- Okay, Michael!

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:49.559
Michael!

01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:47.250
- Hey.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.719
Hey,
honey, how are you?

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:51.454
Sorry to call you at this time.

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:52.522
- No, that's okay.

01:14:52.522 --> 01:14:54.758
It's so good to hear from you.

01:14:54.758 --> 01:14:56.626
How's your stay?

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.194
Pretty good.

01:14:58.194 --> 01:15:01.030
Sorry I waited so
long to contact you.

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:02.131
I've been so busy.

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:03.933
- Don't worry about that.

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:07.604
I'm just really glad to hear
that you're enjoying yourself.

01:15:07.604 --> 01:15:08.805
How's your mother?

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:10.206
She's
doing pretty well.

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:12.776
She just wants to spend
more time with me.

01:15:12.776 --> 01:15:14.611
You wanna talk to her?

01:15:51.615 --> 01:15:54.117
Is everything
goes okay with you?

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:56.452
Have you been eating
and sleeping well?

01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:57.286
- No, thanks for asking.

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.421
I'm doing well.

01:15:58.421 --> 01:16:00.156
Don't worry about me.

01:16:02.626 --> 01:16:04.193
How are the tenants?

01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:07.496
They didn't cause too
much trouble, did they?

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:09.098
- Yeah, they're fine.

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:13.670
They're so busy on their own
I barely see any of them.

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:16.005
That is good to hear.

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:18.007
I'll call you back soon.

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:21.110
I'll let you know
when I'm coming back.

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:23.212
- Sure, just let me know.

01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:27.383
I miss you so much.

01:16:27.383 --> 01:16:28.818
- I miss you too.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.289
I miss you too, very much.

01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:37.560
I'll see you soon.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.662
- I'll see you soon.

01:16:38.662 --> 01:16:39.495
Bye.

01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:32.015
I'm a terrible person.

01:17:34.617 --> 01:17:37.620
I've hurt my wife
so badly, and you.

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:42.291
- Don't say that.

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.794
You are not a terrible person.

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:52.068
- I really did something
wrong this time.

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:56.139
I've always tried being
disciplined and faithful,

01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:01.344
but this time I really
messed things up.

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:07.951
- Will it make you feel better

01:18:07.951 --> 01:18:11.788
if I don't really see
it as that big an issue?

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:15.624
- No.

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.794
How can you say that?

01:18:17.794 --> 01:18:19.796
Everything is going to
fall apart from here.

01:18:19.796 --> 01:18:20.964
Why?

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:27.136
How can you keep on saying why?

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:32.876
- Because this is
between you and me.

01:18:32.876 --> 01:18:36.612
You haven't told
anybody else, right?

01:18:36.612 --> 01:18:40.116
- No, but aren't you
going to expect more?

01:18:42.886 --> 01:18:45.354
We can't do this anymore,

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:49.525
but you're not going to let
it go that easily, right?

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.997
- Do you want to
know why I did it?

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:01.304
I was attracted to the
love between you and Lily,

01:19:01.304 --> 01:19:03.006
and for the first
time in my life,

01:19:03.006 --> 01:19:05.341
I realized why people do it.

01:19:08.544 --> 01:19:09.478
- Marriage.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.148
As strange as it may sound,

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:15.819
you helped me to hope
for a brighter future.

01:19:17.353 --> 01:19:20.689
You helped me to build
a vision of love.

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:24.994
- I'm not sure what
you're trying to say.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.933
Did you think I'm going to
flip everything upside down

01:19:29.933 --> 01:19:32.301
and cause chaos in the house?

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:33.136
No.

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:35.604
I love it here.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:39.708
I love the harmony, the
serenity, the good people.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:45.581
I would never want
to destroy that.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.790
- I don't know, it
means that this is a

01:19:56.725 --> 01:20:00.663
sweet dream that we have
finally woken up from,

01:20:00.663 --> 01:20:04.834
or that my lease for your
love has come to an end.

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:08.104
- A dream.

01:20:08.104 --> 01:20:10.874
- Yeah, it's better
that way, no?

01:20:15.178 --> 01:20:17.680
Besides, I'm leaving, Michael.

01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:23.152
I've become more used
to the environment now,

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:26.589
and I'm moving in with
a bunch of friends.

01:20:26.589 --> 01:20:27.423
- Oxana.

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:28.892
- Please.

01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:32.595
Let's just leave this subject
at the best possible time,

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:33.997
no hard feelings.

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:43.606
The end of
the week actually.

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:45.108
- End of the week.

01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:50.413
- It's a perfect
transition for you, yeah?

01:20:51.915 --> 01:20:56.085
To help settle you back
into the right mind frame.

01:20:57.553 --> 01:21:01.590
It's just too bad I won't
get to say goodbye to Lily.

01:21:03.993 --> 01:21:06.662
- Oxana, this is all so surreal.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.300
How am I supposed to take this?

01:21:16.039 --> 01:21:17.406
- Time will help.

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:36.960
- Here.

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:47.136
What's up, man?

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:49.905
You look awful.

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:52.575
You look like you
haven't slept in days.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:54.077
- Yeah, I haven't.

01:21:55.178 --> 01:21:56.012
- Man.

01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:59.648
You need Lily back ASAP.

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:04.387
- I...

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:09.192
- I've been

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.628
having these dreams.

01:22:17.133 --> 01:22:18.367
- I'm not sure.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:21.904
I thought I could remember them,

01:22:21.904 --> 01:22:25.474
but they just seem
really blurry now.

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:28.577
- Dude, you've gotta
pull yourself together.

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:31.114
Is there anything I can do?

01:22:31.114 --> 01:22:33.782
- No, don't worry, I'll be fine.

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:41.924
- I know this is
none of my business,

01:22:41.924 --> 01:22:43.426
but I have to ask.

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.329
Did you...

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:53.836
Have an affair?

01:22:53.836 --> 01:22:56.172
- No, of course not.

01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:57.506
Only in my head.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:22:59.642
- Good.

01:23:01.177 --> 01:23:04.013
That's sad and
pathetic, but good.

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:05.748
- No.

01:23:07.016 --> 01:23:09.518
I've just stopped
fantasizing about my tenants,

01:23:09.518 --> 01:23:11.720
the whole DIY thing.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.522
I need Lily back.

01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:15.724
- Yeah, definitely.

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.893
Definitely your call, man.

01:23:21.364 --> 01:23:22.531
But seriously,

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:25.601
I admire you.

01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:33.442
- Not giving in
to the temptation.

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:35.010
It's gotta be hard.

01:23:35.911 --> 01:23:37.146
- Yeah.

01:23:37.146 --> 01:23:38.081
Why don't we stop
talking about this?

01:23:38.081 --> 01:23:40.549
It's putting ideas in my head.

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:43.319
- All right, man, your call.

01:23:43.319 --> 01:23:44.220
You got it.

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:16.064
- It's so quiet in
here with just us two.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:20.068
I guess most of the
time it's just you.

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.437
- Yeah.

01:27:21.437 --> 01:27:23.372
It is really quiet now.

01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:28.611
- Maybe that's a good thing.

01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:32.548
You can spend some time
with yourself to think.

01:27:36.519 --> 01:27:38.654
- I mean maybe it's a good thing

01:27:38.654 --> 01:27:41.524
you have some time by yourself.

01:27:41.524 --> 01:27:45.193
You can think about how
you feel about Lily.

01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:51.500
Sometimes we don't know what
we have until it's gone.

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:57.239
You are very lucky.

01:27:57.239 --> 01:28:00.409
Lily's gonna come back to you,

01:28:00.409 --> 01:28:02.978
and you two can be happy again.

01:28:04.547 --> 01:28:05.848
- Yeah.

01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:06.682
I agree.

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:16.825
- Thanks for being there
for me the other night.

01:28:16.825 --> 01:28:18.994
- Don't worry about it.

01:28:18.994 --> 01:28:20.162
Are you feeling better?

01:28:20.162 --> 01:28:21.997
You seemed really sad.

01:28:24.066 --> 01:28:26.134
- I was very heartbroken,

01:28:28.504 --> 01:28:31.006
but I have decided to move on,

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.242
so it's gonna be fine.

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:35.444
- Good.

01:28:35.444 --> 01:28:38.013
I'm glad you found
your sunshine.

01:28:38.013 --> 01:28:42.184
I like you a lot better when
you're happy and smiling.

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:44.319
- I gotta go.

01:28:45.421 --> 01:28:47.856
I got some shopping to do.

01:28:47.856 --> 01:28:48.691
- All right.

01:28:48.691 --> 01:28:49.858
You go, girl.

01:30:48.143 --> 01:30:49.512
I missed you so much.

01:32:02.484 --> 01:32:03.652
I am glad these words

01:32:03.652 --> 01:32:05.287
get one more chance
of being read

01:32:05.287 --> 01:32:08.591
before being burned
away forever.

01:32:08.591 --> 01:32:11.560
I am sorry that I left
before saying goodbye,

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.828
but I think you and I know

01:32:12.828 --> 01:32:15.530
that it is probably
the best thing.

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:18.601
I just want to wish you
all the best, Michael.

01:32:18.601 --> 01:32:20.903
Live well and love your wife,

01:32:20.903 --> 01:32:24.439
and if you want to,
please remember me too.

01:32:24.439 --> 01:32:26.575
I will certainly remember you.

01:32:26.575 --> 01:32:28.143
Felici.

01:34:26.461 --> 01:34:27.295
- Michael.

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.699
The breakfast is ready.

01:34:30.699 --> 01:34:31.900
Do you wanna come and join me?

01:34:32.305 --> 01:34:38.270
