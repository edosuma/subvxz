OUT OF MY OWN GARAGE.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.983
NO, HE CAN´T.

11:52.983 --> 11:55.145
I´LL GET MY TOOLS, I´LL CUT
THROUGH THIS THING RIGHT NOW.

11:55.145 --> 11:57.017

I´LL CUT THROUGH IT LIKE THAT.

12:06.496 --> 12:08.058
HOW´D YOU GET YOUR SKATES
OUT OF THE GARAGE?

12:08.058 --> 12:10.030
GRANDPA GAVE THEM TO ME
BEFORE HE LOCKED IT.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.231
OH, AND HEY...

12:11.231 --> 12:14.464
HE GAVE ME $50
TO BUY WHATEVER I WANTED.

12:14.464 --> 12:17.507
THAT´S MY $50.

12:17.507 --> 12:20.410
HE SAID
YOU´D SAY THAT.

12:20.410 --> 12:22.442
TELL ME THE COMBINATION

12:22.442 --> 12:23.974

12:40.190 --> 12:42.032
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

12:42.032 --> 12:44.264
I SAW GRANDPA WRITE ON
A PIECE OF PAPER

12:44.264 --> 12:45.535
AND SLIP IT UNDER THE MAT.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.812
WHAT?

13:01.812 --> 13:03.513
DO YOU KNOW YOUR DAD PUT A LOCK
ON THE GARAGE DOOR?

13:03.513 --> 13:06.356
NO, I WAS
AT THE STORE ALL MORNING.

13:06.356 --> 13:08.318
HE CAN´T DO THAT.

13:08.318 --> 13:09.820
OH, YES HE CAN,

13:09.820 --> 13:12.222
BECAUSE HE IS OUT OF HIS
MOJITO-DRINKIN´,

CHICKEN-CHASIN´ MIND!

13:16.997 --> 13:18.869
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT

13:18.869 --> 13:20.871
FOR FORCING ME
TO LET HIM IN THE GAME.

13:20.871 --> 13:24.034
I ADMIT, HE´S BEING
IMMATURE AND STUBBORN.

13:24.034 --> 13:26.877
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
SO ARE YOU.

13:26.877 --> 13:28.909
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

13:28.909 --> 13:32.012
OH, UH, I DON´T KNOW.
REMEMBER THIS?

13:37.888 --> 13:40.951
HOW CAN I FORGET
OUR WEEKEND AT THE LAKE?

IT´S ONLY $50.

13:48.899 --> 13:50.000
LET IT GO.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.002
MY DAD HAS DONE
A LOT FOR US.

13:52.002 --> 13:54.264
AND WE´VE DONE
A LOT FOR HIM.

13:54.264 --> 13:56.606
WE LET HIM STAY HERE
WHEN YOUR MOM LEFT HIM.

13:56.606 --> 13:59.940
I WENT HALFWAY TO CUBA TO PULL
HIS BROTHER OUT OF THE OCEAN.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.942
I COMFORTED HIM
WHEN THE GARBAGE MAN

14:01.942 --> 14:04.414
ACCIDENTALLY TOOK AWAY
HIS ANNOYING CONGA DRUM.

14:04.414 --> 14:07.077

THAT WAS STOLEN.

14:09.049 --> 14:13.123
WHO KNOWS
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

14:13.123 --> 14:14.925
THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL.

14:14.925 --> 14:16.356
I´M CALLING HIM RIGHT NOW

14:16.356 --> 14:18.929
AND GETTING HIM
TO TAKE OFF THAT LOCK.

14:18.929 --> 14:20.030

14:21.291 --> 14:23.133
MAX, YOU GOTTA LET ME
IN THE GARAGE.

14:23.133 --> 14:25.035
GRANDPA SAID NOT TO LET
ANYONE IN HIS GARAGE.

14:25.035 --> 14:27.968
MAX, IT´S MY GARAGE, OKAY?
TELL ME THE COMBINATION.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.000
MAX, I WILL RENT A LOWRIDER

14:30.000 --> 14:32.642

TO SCHOOL IN MY UNDERWEAR.

14:32.642 --> 14:35.105
COOL, CAN I GO
IN MY UNDERWEAR TOO?

14:35.105 --> 14:37.107
TELL ME THE COMBINATION.

TO A DYSLEXIC FIFTH-GRADER.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.193
THE MAN
IS AN EVIL GENIUS!

15:28.598 --> 15:31.101
GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

15:31.101 --> 15:32.562

PRIVATE JET TO KUWAIT RIGHT NOW.

I DON´T KNOW WHY I DIDN´T THINK
OF IT SOONER -- IT WAS SO EASY.

16:44.034 --> 16:45.705
OPEN EIGHT NEW CREDIT CARDS,

16:45.705 --> 16:48.338
AND TOOK OUT CASH ADVANCES
ON ALL OF THEM. AYE!

WE´RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY ON THIS?

16:56.015 --> 16:56.786
NO.

HOW CAN YOU PUT YOUR
FAMILY IN DEBT WITHOUT
TALKING TO YOUR WIFE?

17:19.569 --> 17:22.041
THAT´S NO WAY
TO RUN A MARRIAGE.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.543

ABOUT MARRIAGE?

NOT WITH ANOTHER MAN RIGHT NOW.

THAT WAS TOO MUCH.

17:42.132 --> 17:43.493
YEAH, IT WAS.
