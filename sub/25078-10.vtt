00:37.305 --> 00:38.262
Trees.

00:38.551 --> 00:44.055
Surely among the most magnificent
of all living things.

00:45.986 --> 00:49.210
Some are the largest organisms on Earth

00:49.287 --> 00:55.217
dwarfing all others,
and these are the tallest of them all.

01:07.975 --> 01:13.495
The deciduous and coniferous woodlands
that grow in the seasonal parts of our planet

01:13.663 --> 01:17.236
are the most extensive forests on Earth.

01:25.736 --> 01:29.811
Their sheer extent stuns the imagination.

01:42.433 --> 01:45.125
The barren snows of the Arctic.

01:45.216 --> 01:50.082
A thousand miles from the North Pole,
and heading south.

01:53.168 --> 01:56.955
This is the very first place
that trees can grow.

01:59.798 --> 02:02.520
To begin with the conifers are sparse

02:02.824 --> 02:06.003
but soon they dominate the land.

02:14.365 --> 02:17.863
This is the Taiga Forest.

02:19.641 --> 02:25.678
There are as many trees here,
as in all the world's rainforests combined.

02:26.470 --> 02:32.263
The Taiga circles the globe
and contains a third of all the trees on Earth.

02:32.627 --> 02:39.897
It produces so much oxygen, that it
refreshes the atmosphere of the entire planet.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.496
At the Taiga's northern extent

02:46.648 --> 02:51.407
the growing season can last
for just one month a year.

02:51.969 --> 02:56.973
It can take fifty years for a tree
to get bigger than a seedling.

03:10.628 --> 03:12.620
It's a silent world

03:13.000 --> 03:15.190
where little stirs

03:16.938 --> 03:23.037
But there are occasional signs of life.
Stories written in the snow.

03:24.466 --> 03:30.062
The prints of an Arctic fox
and the hare it might've been stalking.

03:35.551 --> 03:39.626
A female polar bear and her two cubs.

03:49.921 --> 03:55.183
Some animals are so difficult to glimpse
that they're like spirits.

03:55.488 --> 04:01.433
One could live a lifetime in these woods
and never see a lynx.

04:04.672 --> 04:08.640
The cat must roam hundreds of miles
in search of prey

04:08.929 --> 04:12.792
and may never visit
the same patch of forest twice.

04:14.572 --> 04:18.053
It's the very essence of wilderness.

04:22.707 --> 04:29.413
With so few prey animals here,
life for a hunter is particularly hard.

04:31.770 --> 04:36.225
Creatures are scarce
because few can eat conifer needles.

04:37.092 --> 04:39.449
The moose is an exception.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.611
Growth is so difficult

04:46.718 --> 04:51.097
that conifers protect their precious leaves
by filling them with resin.

04:51.234 --> 04:56.496
That reduces water loss,
but it also makes them very distasteful.

05:07.476 --> 05:11.141
At least the conifer's seeds are edible

05:11.384 --> 05:14.639
but they're protected within armor plated cones

05:14.942 --> 05:18.334
and it takes a specialist to reach them.

05:20.705 --> 05:22.850
The crossbill's extraordinary beak

05:23.048 --> 05:28.720
can prise apart the scales,
so that it's tongue can extract the seeds.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.814
Birds are fortunate.

05:34.073 --> 05:38.088
When the seasonal crop is gathered,
they can fly south

05:42.649 --> 05:47.668
But one animal is so expert at survival
in this frozen forest

05:47.911 --> 05:52.381
that it stays here and is active
all year long.

05:54.921 --> 05:59.681
In local folklore,
the wolverine is a link to the spirit world

05:59.849 --> 06:02.646
and a cross between a bear and a wolf.

06:02.981 --> 06:06.934
In reality,
it's a huge weasel.

06:09.050 --> 06:13.795
It's bulk helps to conserve body heat
and also broadens it's menu.

06:13.977 --> 06:19.437
It's so big and powerful,
it can even bring down an adult caribou.

06:20.987 --> 06:26.416
For it's size, it's said that the animal can eat
more in one sitting than any other

06:26.644 --> 06:30.339
which is why it's also known as the glutton.

06:47.887 --> 06:52.175
Being gluttonous here
is a very effective strategy.

06:52.221 --> 06:56.433
It's wise to eat all you can,
when you can

06:57.999 --> 07:01.101
and when even a glutton can't eat more

07:01.177 --> 07:06.697
it stores what's left for later,
in the surrounding deep freeze.

07:13.509 --> 07:16.398
Spring in the ice forest.

07:27.726 --> 07:32.287
The capercaillie can also digest conifer needles

07:32.485 --> 07:36.105
but feeding is not it's priority at the moment.

07:38.597 --> 07:43.114
Like gladiators,
the males square up for a battle.

07:54.064 --> 07:59.355
Each may have just a single chance
to impress a female.

08:00.435 --> 08:04.724
Neither can afford a lapse in concentration.

08:29.224 --> 08:33.328
The injured loser may not survive.

08:38.105 --> 08:40.918
The inhabitants of this great wilderness

08:40.919 --> 08:45.526
may live and die
without ever having contact with humanity.

08:46.163 --> 08:48.703
Long may it be that way.

08:58.572 --> 09:02.116
The northern forest may be the largest on Earth

09:02.117 --> 09:06.357
but to see coniferous trees
that have reached their full potential

09:06.585 --> 09:10.554
you must travel a thousand miles south of here.

09:16.135 --> 09:18.918
The Pacific Coast of North America.

09:25.456 --> 09:31.418
The land of hemlock, douglas fir
and giant redwood.

09:39.098 --> 09:42.671
Here, water is never locked up in ice

09:42.731 --> 09:44.557
and even if rains fail

09:44.784 --> 09:50.532
the needles can extract moisture
from the fogs that roll in from the sea.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.481
The Sun's energy powers these forests

10:01.482 --> 10:07.184
not for one month as it does in the Taiga
but for half the year.

10:15.989 --> 10:20.551
These conifers grow at ten times the rate
of those near the Arctic

10:20.856 --> 10:24.231
and they live for thousands of years.

10:34.102 --> 10:37.097
One grove of redwoods in California

10:37.159 --> 10:41.295
contains three of the tallest trees on Earth.

10:46.556 --> 10:52.821
This one is over a hundred meters high,
the size of a thirty story building.

11:21.117 --> 11:26.575
These forests were growing here
long before humans walked the Earth.

11:26.758 --> 11:30.113
They were in their prime
twenty million years ago

11:30.230 --> 11:36.138
and existed before the Swiss Alps
or the Rocky Mountains were even raised.

11:48.842 --> 11:55.318
There is more living matter in a forest
of giant conifers, than in any tropical rainforest

11:55.835 --> 11:59.206
but it's all contained within the trees.

11:59.456 --> 12:02.995
These are as inedible as those in the Taiga

12:03.211 --> 12:08.703
so animals are still scarce,
but they are present.

12:12.092 --> 12:19.568
A pine marten. It's spring,
the best time of year for a marten to find food.

12:35.008 --> 12:42.052
Bird's eggs are a seasonal snack
and for a short time, there's plenty of them

12:43.437 --> 12:46.374
Sometimes perhaps, too many.

12:49.663 --> 12:55.638
But to live here permanently,
the marten needs a more reliable food source.

12:56.355 --> 12:58.759
Squirrels fit the bill.

12:58.976 --> 13:03.900
They thrive here on the pine cones
and although these are also seasonal

13:03.983 --> 13:07.822
they can be stored and eaten
throughout the year.

13:12.129 --> 13:15.133
The squirrels are busy mating

13:18.906 --> 13:24.714
Good news for the hunter.
A distracted squirrel, is a vulnerable squirrel.

13:31.373 --> 13:34.862
But, this time, the amorous couple is safe.

13:35.062 --> 13:40.487
There is a loner stocking his larder,
who will be the easier target.

14:15.384 --> 14:20.850
Early summer,
and great grey owl chicks are fledging.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.983
Adults can only raise young here

14:26.046 --> 14:30.907
in years when the seasonal vole crop
is big enough to support them.

14:35.768 --> 14:39.691
The moment has arrived for their first flight.

14:44.406 --> 14:50.936
Leaping from the world's tallest trees
is not for the faint hearted.

15:16.179 --> 15:22.062
If you're going to fall here
it's quite a good idea to do it in stages.

15:40.381 --> 15:44.722
The ground is no place for an owl.

15:46.369 --> 15:51.397
If he's to climb to the top of his class
he'll need to persevere

15:53.985 --> 15:57.719
So now, let's have another go.

16:17.477 --> 16:22.964
The American conifer forests
may not be the richest in animal life

16:23.193 --> 16:26.406
but their trees are extraordinary.

16:26.949 --> 16:33.520
This giant sequoia, a relative of the redwood,
is the largest living thing on Earth.

16:33.895 --> 16:39.653
Known as General Sherman,
it's the weight of ten blue whales.

16:49.397 --> 16:57.680
Higher up in the nearby mountains, bristlecone pines,
the oldest organisms on the planet.

16:59.224 --> 17:03.105
Some have been here
for five thousand years.

17:03.106 --> 17:06.193
They were alive before the pyramids were built

17:06.359 --> 17:12.013
and were already three thousand years old
when Christ was born.

17:16.396 --> 17:24.450
Across the Equator, in the southern hemisphere
there are forests that mirror those of the north.

17:24.825 --> 17:26.515
Here in South America

17:26.557 --> 17:31.961
araucaria trees or monkey puzzles
are like the conifers of the Taiga.

17:32.566 --> 17:35.695
They have waterproof scales,
instead of needles

17:35.715 --> 17:41.182
and their cones look a little different
but the principles are the same.

17:45.521 --> 17:51.843
Slender billed parakeets
rather than crossbills, extract their seeds.

17:59.563 --> 18:06.885
Where the growing season is longerm,
there are alerce trees the redwoods of the south.

18:21.387 --> 18:28.377
As in the frozen north, the Valdivian forests
of Chile support very few animals

18:28.648 --> 18:32.299
but that is the end of the similarity.

18:35.512 --> 18:40.540
This is a bizarre world of miniature creatures.

18:42.814 --> 18:50.221
The pudu, the world's smallest deer
feeds on the giant leaves of the gunnera plant.

18:57.293 --> 19:01.424
The female is just thirty centimeters high
at the shoulder

19:01.445 --> 19:05.577
and her infants are hardly bigger than kittens.

19:22.329 --> 19:28.859
The male must stay alert.
There are hunters here who would snatch his young.

19:30.653 --> 19:34.367
Another miniature.
The kodkod cat.

19:37.913 --> 19:44.547
It's the smallest cat in all the Americas
and a young pudu would be a feast for it

19:45.758 --> 19:51.223
But, with the male on guard,
the kodkod must lower his sights.

19:56.273 --> 20:00.153
Moths are hatching.
They're the last of the summer.

20:00.467 --> 20:04.640
The tiny cat
should be able to score with these.

20:07.143 --> 20:10.357
No one knows why the creatures here are so small

20:10.419 --> 20:14.905
but at least they can survive on meager rations.

20:41.027 --> 20:45.262
You might call this
a game of cat and moth.

21:09.046 --> 21:15.764
As winter approaches in Chile
spring is arriving in the northern hemisphere.

21:23.546 --> 21:27.948
These are the deciduous forests of Homme.

21:28.679 --> 21:31.726
Dormant throughout the winter,
they now undergo

21:31.830 --> 21:36.691
one of the most magical transformations
in the natural world.

21:48.626 --> 21:53.841
By late spring the landscape is
wrapped in a vibrant fresh green.

21:54.238 --> 21:58.494
Here, instead of conifers,
there are broad leaved trees

21:58.724 --> 22:03.481
and that makes the character of this forest
entirely different.

22:07.653 --> 22:12.389
Being broad, these leaves trap
much more light than needles

22:12.660 --> 22:17.041
but they're also thin, soft and edible.

22:36.028 --> 22:39.679
And others can eat
the leaf eaters.

23:01.877 --> 23:09.012
It's spring in the great broad leaved forests
of Eastern Europe and Asiatic Russia.

23:09.930 --> 23:13.038
The mandarin ducks are courting.

23:26.411 --> 23:29.973
The female mandarin nests in a tree hole

23:30.167 --> 23:35.432
and when it's time for everyone to leave
she leads the way.

23:38.127 --> 23:42.051
The ducklings are only twenty four hours old.

23:44.202 --> 23:48.572
It's a long drop,
and a few calls of encouragement are required.

24:02.367 --> 24:05.314
Two down
seven to go.

24:39.607 --> 24:41.855
There are still two missing.

25:03.918 --> 25:06.194
All present and correct.

25:06.990 --> 25:09.964
But they won't be safe
until they reach water

25:10.159 --> 25:14.041
and the forest pool
is almost a mile away.

25:49.944 --> 25:53.170
By June the days are at their longest

25:53.282 --> 25:58.895
and all across the northern hemisphere
the broad leaves are hard at work.

26:08.197 --> 26:13.461
On the east coast of North America
it seems like any other summer's evening

26:15.723 --> 26:19.116
but tonight is special.

26:22.816 --> 26:25.931
After seventeen years underground

26:26.237 --> 26:29.002
creatures are stirring.

26:35.007 --> 26:40.229
The nymphs of the periodical cicada
have been biding their time.

26:40.454 --> 26:47.519
Now they march like zombies
towards the nearest tree, and start to climb.

26:55.268 --> 26:58.090
At first, there are merely thousands

26:58.411 --> 27:03.326
but soon, more than a billion
swarm all over the forest.

27:03.528 --> 27:08.294
The biggest insect emergence
on the planet is underway.

27:39.189 --> 27:44.792
They invade the upper branches,
where they climb out of their external skeletons

27:44.898 --> 27:48.842
and assume their adult winged form.

27:57.097 --> 28:03.451
At first they're white and soft, but they have
until dawn to complete their transformation.

28:17.938 --> 28:24.798
After an absence of seventeen years,
the forest is now overrun by cicadas.

28:33.019 --> 28:37.697
The adults are clumsy
and very edible.

28:46.895 --> 28:50.002
For turtles and other inhabitants of the forest

28:50.176 --> 28:53.963
this is a feast they're lucky to see
once in their lifetime

28:54.033 --> 28:57.279
and they gorge themselves while they can.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.094
Times have never been so good.

29:13.442 --> 29:19.586
The cicadas have no defenses
and virtually offer themselves to their attackers.

29:29.606 --> 29:32.538
The stream of insects is so relentless

29:32.591 --> 29:37.478
that soon all the predators are full
to the point of bursting

29:48.825 --> 29:51.443
and still the cicadas come.

29:51.653 --> 29:57.587
With the predators overwhelmed
the survivors can achieve their purpose.

30:00.241 --> 30:05.843
After mating, the adults lay their eggs
and then their job is done.

30:06.297 --> 30:11.639
In just a few days they will all die
and the forest will fall silent.

30:12.057 --> 30:18.481
The cicadas here, will not be heard again
for another seventeen years.

30:28.064 --> 30:34.976
Having fed the predators, the cicadas
leave one final gift for the forest itself.

30:35.134 --> 30:41.294
The nutrients in a generation of cicadas
are returned to the soil, all at once

30:41.539 --> 30:45.204
and the trees enjoy a marked spurt in growth.

30:45.570 --> 30:51.208
This may be the single largest dose
of fertilizer in the natural world.

31:12.467 --> 31:15.941
In the great
broad leaf forests of Eastern Europe

31:16.080 --> 31:24.598
the days are beginning to shorten,
and a primeval sound heralds the onset of autumn.

31:42.366 --> 31:46.922
Male red deer are starting their rut.

31:52.193 --> 31:56.521
The air is heavy with the scent of females.

32:07.867 --> 32:09.735
The rules are simple.

32:10.188 --> 32:12.440
Winner takes all.

33:06.602 --> 33:11.768
Across the northern hemisphere
the deciduous forests are changing.

33:12.083 --> 33:18.018
Leaves that have provided food and shelter
since the spring, are now shed.

33:22.450 --> 33:29.082
In the broad leaf forests of Russia
winter is particularly severe

33:33.692 --> 33:38.683
but there will always be some
who benefit from hardship.

33:42.524 --> 33:46.399
Black vultures scavenge from the carcass
of a seeker deer

33:46.486 --> 33:49.297
that has died of cold or starvation.

33:49.611 --> 33:52.037
These endangered birds are visitors.

33:52.072 --> 33:57.727
They've come down from the north to escape
the even colder conditions in Siberia.

34:35.271 --> 34:37.261
An Amur leopard.

34:37.453 --> 34:40.263
The rarest cat on Earth.

34:40.839 --> 34:43.963
Winter is a difficult time for this hunter.

34:44.068 --> 34:48.344
There are no leaves for cover
and no young prey animals.

34:48.607 --> 34:54.436
This female has the added pressure,
of having to provide for her one year old cub.

34:54.733 --> 35:00.179
It'll be another twelve months,
before he'll be able to fend for himself.

35:12.711 --> 35:16.655
The bickering vultures
have abandoned the carcass.

35:16.690 --> 35:20.443
It's a valuable discovery for the leopards.

35:25.121 --> 35:30.078
But the cub doesn't share
it's mother's sense of urgency.

35:59.512 --> 36:03.198
The vultures have left behind
plenty of good meat

36:03.575 --> 36:05.963
but it's stiff with frost.

36:08.631 --> 36:14.203
The mother works to open the hide,
and make feeding a little easier for her cub.

36:25.848 --> 36:30.302
There are only forty Amur leopards
left in the wild

36:32.537 --> 36:35.413
and that number is still falling.

36:36.447 --> 36:41.153
The harshness of the winter here
hinders their increasing numbers.

36:41.376 --> 36:45.622
It takes one of these females
longer to raise her young to independence

36:45.690 --> 36:48.470
than it does a leopard in Africa.

36:56.304 --> 37:00.549
If the mother can sustain her cub
for a few more weeks

37:00.633 --> 37:06.400
spring will bring an increase in prey
and her task will lighten.

37:11.524 --> 37:15.057
For all the inhabitants of this seasonal forest

37:15.267 --> 37:18.743
the long, cold wait is nearly over.

37:31.196 --> 37:35.414
Spring in a deciduous woodland
is special.

37:39.310 --> 37:44.393
With no leaves overhead, the rays of the sun
strike the forest floor directly

37:44.561 --> 37:48.778
and their warmth rouses plants
from their winter sleep.

37:56.123 --> 37:58.581
The ground living plants are in a hurry.

37:58.720 --> 38:03.719
Before long the trees above
will come into leaf and steal their light.

38:13.701 --> 38:16.438
Their flowers decorate the forest floor

38:16.494 --> 38:21.730
as they advertise their sweet nectar
to the newly emerged insects.

38:39.086 --> 38:43.331
The spring blooms of the deciduous woodlands
have no equivalent

38:43.441 --> 38:48.091
in either the great conifer forests,
or the tropical jungles.

38:53.034 --> 38:57.071
Within a matter of weeks
the canopy has closed

38:57.072 --> 39:02.278
and only a few wheeling shafts of light
penetrate the woodland.

39:10.629 --> 39:15.446
In the treetops, the broad leaves
rapidly expand to their full size

39:15.571 --> 39:19.384
to make the most of summer
while it lasts.

39:25.319 --> 39:30.066
Then, after a few months,
the days begin to shorten again

39:30.303 --> 39:34.660
and the trees must shut down
and shed their leaves in preparation

39:34.661 --> 39:38.053
for the cold dark time ahead.

39:42.452 --> 39:48.192
Great tracts of North America flush red
as the season progresses.

39:49.503 --> 39:53.791
The effect is so spectacular
and so extensive

39:54.028 --> 39:56.960
that it can be seen from space.

40:11.972 --> 40:18.243
The threat of winter frost is not
the only reason for trees to shed leaves.

40:22.682 --> 40:25.502
These forests stand in the tropics.

40:25.768 --> 40:28.547
Here day length never changes

40:28.728 --> 40:31.061
but the dry season is so severe

40:31.145 --> 40:34.315
that the trees can't afford to loose
the amount of water

40:34.384 --> 40:40.053
that would evaporate from their broad leaves,
so the leaves must be shed.

40:57.886 --> 41:02.479
The forest resembles a European woodland
in mid winter

41:02.870 --> 41:08.399
but the heat is overpowering,
and it's inhabitants, unfamiliar.

41:12.240 --> 41:18.161
For the creatures of India's teak forests,
these are desperate times

41:19.459 --> 41:21.735
but salvation is at hand.

41:21.986 --> 41:25.142
The mahwa tree is about to bloom.

41:29.472 --> 41:33.801
It's flowers are full of liquid
making them irresistible.

41:41.049 --> 41:45.977
The mahwa is an oasis
in a hot dry desert.

41:56.367 --> 42:02.106
Those that fly or climb
are not the only ones to get a share.

42:05.275 --> 42:08.389
Chital deer follow the langur monkeys

42:08.626 --> 42:11.810
collecting the flowers that fall.

42:17.382 --> 42:23.693
The monkeys welcome the deer,
for deer are unrivaled at spotting predators.

42:25.131 --> 42:29.279
If they are relaxed,
it must be safe to come down to the ground

42:29.390 --> 42:31.987
and gather the food that lies there

42:42.810 --> 42:47.502
but it's not wise to travel far
from the sentinels.

43:41.176 --> 43:43.075
Tropical Madagascar.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.700
The wet season.

43:52.319 --> 43:56.285
It's now that the baobab trees
regrow their leaves

43:56.481 --> 44:02.541
and collect water to store in their huge trunks,
ready for the dry season ahead.

44:23.990 --> 44:27.606
The prehistoric shape of these trees
is rightly famous

44:27.787 --> 44:31.544
but few have ever witnessed
the baobab's real magic

44:31.795 --> 44:36.376
for that happens at night
and high in the treetops.

44:41.511 --> 44:49.103
Flush with water, the baobab prepares itself
for an unforgettable display.

45:05.651 --> 45:11.603
Once started the foot long flowers
can open fully in less than a minute.

45:56.357 --> 46:01.437
As the flowers open,
the creatures of the forest wake.

46:13.130 --> 46:17.354
The mouse lemurs have been hibernating
throughout the dry season.

46:17.721 --> 46:22.137
With the return of rains
it's time to get busy.

46:26.883 --> 46:31.370
A dozen share this tree hole,
but there's plenty of room.

46:31.387 --> 46:36.344
The world's smallest primate
is no bigger than your hand.

46:41.668 --> 46:47.672
High in the branches above,
the baobab's nectar is starting to flow.

47:01.513 --> 47:04.935
A drink of this sugary energy packed liquid

47:05.161 --> 47:09.612
is an ideal way for the lemurs
to start their day.

47:13.208 --> 47:18.917
Liquid oozes from the flower's center
and trickles down the petals

47:35.062 --> 47:38.937
But the nectar is not intended for lemurs.

47:42.498 --> 47:48.992
These giant hawk moths
are the drinkers the tree needs to attract.

47:58.172 --> 48:06.306
As they sip, moving from tree to tree,
so they transfer pollen and fertilize the flowers.

48:20.113 --> 48:24.459
Nectar was an excellent first course
for the lemurs

48:24.687 --> 48:27.881
but moths are the main dish.

48:29.174 --> 48:31.966
The moths are very important to the lemurs

48:32.141 --> 48:39.088
for they will replenish the fat reserves
that the lemurs need to survive the barren dry season.

48:46.889 --> 48:50.415
The lemurs might seem to be a pest
for the baobab.

48:50.555 --> 48:53.993
They kill it's pollinators
and rob it of it's nectar

48:54.098 --> 48:56.908
but they do give something in return.

48:57.013 --> 49:02.528
For, as the wrestle with the moths,
their fur inevitably becomes dusted with pollen

49:02.772 --> 49:06.630
so they, too, become pollinators.

49:28.746 --> 49:35.554
As the alternation of wet and dry seasons
brings change to some tropical forests

49:35.693 --> 49:42.115
so the progression of summer to winter
dictates life in more temperate regions.

49:51.035 --> 49:54.596
Whether trees have needles or broad leaves

49:54.735 --> 50:00.705
it is their ability to survive annual change,
that has enabled them to cover

50:00.706 --> 50:03.393
such vast areas of the Earth

50:03.586 --> 50:05.837
and made the seasonal forests

50:06.030 --> 50:11.615
the greatest forests of all.
