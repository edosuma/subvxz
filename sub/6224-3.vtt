00:02.461 --> 00:05.749
Great dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:05.923 --> 00:10.963
The destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young man.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.003
His name: Merlin.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.807
Merlin:
You're still angry with me, aren't you?

00:23.482 --> 00:26.315
We spend the entire day hunting,
catch nothing...

00:26.485 --> 00:28.692
Because every time we got
anywhere near anything...

00:28.862 --> 00:30.443
You sneezed and frightened it away.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.321
- Not the last time.
- No, that time you fell into a stream.

00:33.492 --> 00:36.154
No one could accuse you
of being predictable, Merlin.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.741
- I think I'm getting a cold.
- Let's hope it's a bad one.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.997
- What was that?
- I think it was a bird.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.671
That? That was definitely
a woman screaming.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.384
Why couldn't it have just been a bird?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.724
Never just a bird.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.534
What are you doing?

01:19.705 --> 01:22.447
Well, I assume you want
to risk our lives and see what's going on.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.418
I never thought I'd say this, Merlin,
but you're learning.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.544
Arthur: Let the woman go.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.683
Man:
This woman has been sentenced to death

01:43.854 --> 01:45.014
it does not concern you.

01:45.188 --> 01:49.101
I am Arthur pendragon, king of Camelot,
and your village is in my lands.

01:49.276 --> 01:54.646
Her sorcery has brought sickness
and suffering to this village.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.188
Did she receive a fair trial?

01:56.366 --> 01:58.778
Your father would have shown her no mercy.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.826
I am not my father. Now cut her down.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.785
I will not endanger the lives
of all who live here.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.372
I said

02:12.382 --> 02:13.792
cut her down.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.815
Arthur: Is there anything more you can do?
- She won't make it through the night.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.900
Make her as comfortable as possible.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.118
Thank you.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.408
You should try and get some rest.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.665
My time has come.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.174
When you have lived as long as I...

02:57.886 --> 03:03.256
You no longer fear the journey
to the next world.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.390
A gift for you.

03:08.313 --> 03:12.431
Show it kindness and compassion.

03:13.235 --> 03:17.820
Those are the qualities of a true king.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.316
Open it.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.036
Arthur: It's beautiful.

03:31.962 --> 03:36.831
It has the power to summon
the spirits of the dead.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.553
Gaius: The horn of cathbad.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.513
When uther attacked
the isle of the blessed

04:30.687 --> 04:32.894
the horn of cathbad
was smuggled to safety...

04:33.064 --> 04:34.600
Before the temple fell.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.606
It hasn't been heard of since.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.577
The old woman said it could be used
to open a door to the spirit world.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.774
I have seen it with my own eyes.

04:41.948 --> 04:46.157
Long before the time of the great purge,
I took part in such ceremonies.

04:47.329 --> 04:52.869
Each year at beltane, the high priestesses
would gather at the great stones of nemeton...

04:54.461 --> 04:56.827
And summon the spirits
of their ancestors.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.707
It holds powerful magic.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.591
You must keep it safe.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.573
He's always like this
at the anniversary of his coronation.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.364
I thought it was a cause for celebration.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.542
It is

05:37.712 --> 05:40.920
but it's also the anniversary
of uther's death.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.169
Merlin: What are you doing?
- Nothing.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.297
Thinking.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.294
Shut up.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.679
Leave it. Why?

07:16.853 --> 07:19.845
Because I'm telling you to
and I'm the king of Camelot.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.856
Not that that seems to
mean anything to you.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.837
Ready the horses and gather some supplies.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.608
Uh, where are we going?
You don't need to know.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.153
Do not breathe a word of this to anyone.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.867
Not even Guinevere.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.248
You're threatening me with a spoon?

07:40.418 --> 07:42.500
Merlin: Ow!

07:53.014 --> 07:55.050
I'm getting a very bad feeling
about this place.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.887
That is because you are a coward.

07:58.061 --> 08:02.145
No, it's because I value my life
and I don't want to die horribly.

08:02.315 --> 08:06.183
- Fair point.
- So are we going to turn back?

08:06.361 --> 08:07.942
No

08:18.915 --> 08:20.030
What are they?

08:21.042 --> 08:22.907
The great stones of nemeton.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.337
- You're going to use it?
- This'll be the only chance...

08:37.433 --> 08:40.221
I'll have to see my father again.
I can't let it pass.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.976
This is powerful magic.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.317
My father was taken from me
before his time.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.491
Now, there isn't a day that passes
when I don't think of the things...

08:56.661 --> 08:58.151
I'd wished I'd said to him.

09:00.206 --> 09:04.745
If you were given the same chance
to see your father...

09:05.128 --> 09:06.868
Talk to him.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.621
Wouldn't you do the same?

09:51.841 --> 09:56.801
A rt ee a a me a a ae aa on = ea tar ea peo ees ser erase re ee
ag a eg so a tp crore es es ree er ee ee ee se ee a ee na eee

10:43.434 --> 10:44.970
Father.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.594
Arthur.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.223
I thought I'd never see you again.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.944
There isn't a day that passes
when I don't think of you.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.904
And I you.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.113
There are times when I feel so alone

11:02.287 --> 11:05.324
I wish more than anything
that you were by my side.

11:05.498 --> 11:11.459
If I were at your side, I fear you
would not like all that I have to say.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.371
- What do you mean?
- Many of the decisions you've made...

11:14.549 --> 11:18.292
Since you've become king
go against all that I taught you.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.505
I have done what I have
believed to be right.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.265
You have ignored our tradition,
our ancient lores.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.677
You have allowed common men
to become knights.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.768
And they are some of the finest knights
that Camelot's ever known.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.142
They would gladly give their lives
for the kingdom.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.357
They question your decisions.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.816
They make you look weak.

11:39.991 --> 11:43.779
Listening to others is a sign of strength,
not weakness

11:44.454 --> 11:50.950
how do you expect anyone to fear a king
who does not know his own mind?

11:51.419 --> 11:54.957
I don't want my people to respect me
because they fear me.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.998
Then they will not respect you at all.

11:59.886 --> 12:04.346
Your marriage should have served
to form an alliance with another kingdom.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.257
You choose to marry a serving girl.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.426
I married for love.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.595
I love Guinevere

12:12.565 --> 12:15.398
more than I can express.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.026
There are some things
that are more important than love.

12:19.989 --> 12:25.404
It is your duty to strengthen
and protect the kingdom.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.695
You have failed.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.711
I've always strived to make you proud.

12:36.881 --> 12:42.501
How can I be proud of a son who ignores
everything that I taught him...

12:43.346 --> 12:46.258
Who is destroying my legacy?

12:49.102 --> 12:52.640
- I've brought peace to the kingdom.
- At what price?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.350
The peace cannot last.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.732
If you are not strong,
the kingdom will fall.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.396
You must go now.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.443
I need more time.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.062
There's still so much I wish to say.

13:11.207 --> 13:15.496
If you stay, you will be forever trapped
in the world of the dead

13:15.670 --> 13:17.535
you must go now.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.670
(50.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.836
This

13:23.428 --> 13:25.188
can't be the last
time I'll ever see you.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.712
Think about everything
that I have said to you.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.097
It isn't too late.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.850
Now go.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.986
I will always love you, Arthur.

14:18.733 --> 14:19.768
Arthur.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.501
Do you want to talk about it?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.790
What happened at the stones?

14:47.178 --> 14:50.386
It seems my father doesn't approve
of the way I've chosen to rule his kingdom.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.219
You mean your kingdom.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.482
The things he said about the knights,
about marrying Guinevere.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.485
What if he's right? What if I have...

15:06.197 --> 15:07.983
Weakened Camelot?

15:08.157 --> 15:10.022
No. Do you really believe that?

15:10.201 --> 15:12.442
You've always done
what you believe to be right.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.735
People respect you.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.280
Thank you, Merlin.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.625
Some people still think
you're a foolish arrogant ass.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.044
Who?

15:27.885 --> 15:29.000
Very funny.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.010
We should get some sleep.

15:41.816 --> 15:45.229
We covered the area
from paulet down to meldreth

15:45.403 --> 15:49.692
this includes 30 troops at bawtry...

15:49.907 --> 15:54.116
15 at tallen, 10 at chime...

15:54.787 --> 15:56.573
Nine at broom...

16:14.474 --> 16:16.806
11 at bowell.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.484
I want the table repaired before
the next council meeting.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.444
Are you listening to me, Merlin?

16:34.619 --> 16:37.076
What? Sorry, I was just thinking
about what happened.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.446
Did you get a terrible fright?

16:38.581 --> 16:40.537
Yes, my heart nearly jumped out
through my mouth.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.666
Well, maybe you should have the rest
of the day off and put your feet up.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.292
Really?

16:47.548 --> 16:48.583
You were joking.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.750
There really is no limit
to your intelligence, is there, Merlin?

17:03.231 --> 17:04.811
Arthur: Merlin.

17:15.617 --> 17:19.702
Why does it always take you
twice as long to change out of your armor?

17:19.872 --> 17:22.534
Because I'm twice the
size of you, little man.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.540
Then why is it that your brain is so small?

18:05.251 --> 18:06.741
Hello?

18:10.673 --> 18:12.288
Someone there”?

18:16.304 --> 18:18.010
Show yourself.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.283
The ax must've fallen off the rack.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.746
I'm surprised that a falling ax
would cause such a deep wound.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.784
Percival:
Not surprised as I was.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.501
Quite. You're lucky you weren't
more severely injured.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.548
Strange.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.877
What's that?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.471
Just before it happened,
I sensed something...

19:02.642 --> 19:05.930
Lllke there was someone
there watching me.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.310
I'm sure it was just my mind
playing tricks on me.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.644
Gaius: Apply a second poultice
in the morning and no training.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.022
Thank you, Gaius.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.333
Is there something wrong, Merlin?

19:41.013 --> 19:45.256
Merlin, I get the distinct impression
there's something you're not telling me.

19:46.227 --> 19:49.094
No. Why would you say that?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.262
Because there usually is.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.474
We went to the stones of nemeton.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.486
- Merlin, I warned you of the dangers.
- I tried to stop him.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.068
He was insistent.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.609
What is it, Merlin?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.454
After the candelabra fell

20:09.625 --> 20:12.332
I was in the corridor
outside the council chambers.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.744
I could sense something.
It was like percival said

20:14.922 --> 20:16.253
a presence of some kind.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.257
In the days of the old religion...

20:20.428 --> 20:24.922
The priestesses trained for years
before entering into the spirit world.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.589
It was fraught with dangers.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.053
There was one thing they were schooled
never to do.

20:29.854 --> 20:34.769
As the vell closed, they were never
to look back at the spirit.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.648
What happened if they did?

20:36.819 --> 20:39.936
They'd release the spirit into this world.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.446
Arthur must have looked back.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.871
- What?
Merlin: At the stones of nemeton.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.908
I think that you may have released
your father's spirit.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.753
And what makes you think that?

21:05.931 --> 21:10.095
As the vell closed,
did you look back at your father?

21:15.816 --> 21:19.559
I may have glanced around for a second.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.237
In that second.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.023
You unleashed uther's spirit.

21:27.495 --> 21:30.612
All these strange things
that have been happening:

21:30.790 --> 21:34.032
- Candelabra falling onto the round table...
- Yes, because the chain broke.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.576
The ax falling on percival?
“Was an accident.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.039
Was it?

21:38.214 --> 21:41.422
Do you really expect me to believe
that my father's spirit...

21:41.592 --> 21:42.992
Is responsible for these things?

21:43.135 --> 21:47.378
The round table represents everything
that's changed since you became king.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.547
You told me how uther disapproved.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.432
He's angry with you,
and that makes him dangerous.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.403
I know my father.
He wouldn't do these things.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.179
I think he'd do anything
to protect his legacy.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.813
- Who knows what he's capable of?
- Enough. That's enough.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.104
I eave me.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.239
(50.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.830
Is someone there?

25:34.742 --> 25:36.027
(Wen!

25:44.668 --> 25:46.033
(Wen.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.193
Merlin: You know this was uther.
Arthur: We don't know what happened.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.682
So Gwen just mysteriously ended up
locked in the kitchen

26:02.853 --> 26:05.344
which just mysteriously caught fire?

26:07.900 --> 26:10.812
You said yourself uther disapproved
of you marrying Gwen.

26:10.986 --> 26:15.195
- He wouldn't do this.
- I know how hard this is for you.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.612
Gaius, how is she?

26:20.496 --> 26:24.614
Smoke has entered her lungs,
but with time, she'll heal.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.953
I've given her a sleeping draft.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.958
She was lucky to escape with her life.

26:32.424 --> 26:36.087
I've always known my father could be cruel,
but why would he do this to Guinevere?

26:36.261 --> 26:38.422
He knows how much I love her.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.762
(Saius.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.393
What do you know about ghosts?

26:49.149 --> 26:52.357
Gaius: We must force uther's spirit
fo return to the other world.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.519
Before he does any more harm.

26:56.907 --> 27:01.776
You must use the horn of cathbad
to re-open the veil between the worlds.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.242
But you must remember one thing:

27:09.419 --> 27:14.914
Only the person who summoned the spirit
cah force it from this world.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.678
Sorry.

27:22.266 --> 27:24.186
Well, you're fortunate
I'm not easily frightened.

27:24.351 --> 27:27.843
Really”? Because it looked like
you jumped out of your skin.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.763
Yeah, that's because you're a clumsy oat.
Now pick that lot up.

27:34.528 --> 27:37.110
Where is Gaius?
How long does it take to make a potion?

27:37.281 --> 27:41.194
These things take time,
if they're to be done properly.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.031
What is it?

27:51.920 --> 27:53.956
I heard something behind the door.

27:55.132 --> 27:57.123
You're imagining things, Merlin.

28:12.316 --> 28:13.931
What do we do?

29:14.795 --> 29:16.331
There's your ghost, Merlin.

29:27.891 --> 29:31.884
The potion will allow you
to see uther in his spirit form.

29:32.062 --> 29:36.931
Once you're in his presence,
you must blow the horn.

29:37.109 --> 29:41.352
It's the only way you can force him
to go back to the spirit world.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.564
Is it safe?

29:47.452 --> 29:49.818
I can't say I'm entirely sure.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.994
What are you waiting for?
“To see if it's safe.

30:00.257 --> 30:02.964
So if I don't die, you'll take yours?

30:03.135 --> 30:04.716
Precisely.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.968
(Set on with it

30:23.405 --> 30:25.862
Well, at least we know
it doesn't kill you instantly.

30:31.621 --> 30:32.906
That... oh.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.781
That is the foulest thing I've ever tasted.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.713
Sorry, did I forget to
tell you about that part?

31:00.859 --> 31:02.315
Merlin: There

31:02.652 --> 31:04.188
where?

31:09.701 --> 31:12.659
Oh. It's just our shadows.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.446
Ow!

31:36.520 --> 31:38.681
Arthur. Merlin.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.720
Both: Leon.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.604
- Is everything all right, my lord?
- It's perfectly fine.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.481
We're

31:49.074 --> 31:51.065
Merlin, tell Leon what we're doing.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.733
We're

31:54.329 --> 31:56.320
I'm teaching him some poetry.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.201
Poetry?

32:00.043 --> 32:02.204
I love poetry.

32:04.381 --> 32:07.623
I was as surprised as you are.
He can't get enough of it.

32:08.385 --> 32:11.923
I'll leave you to your
poetry then, my lord.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.342
Poetry? That's the best
you could come up with?

32:19.521 --> 32:21.887
- Oh, what did you want me to say?
- I don't know.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.932
Something that didn't make me
sound like a love-struck girl.

32:27.571 --> 32:31.109
- What was that?
- It was my father.

32:38.999 --> 32:42.457
Never thought the day would come
when I'd be hunting my own father.

32:43.712 --> 32:47.250
When I became king, more than anything,
I wanted to make him proud.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.503
What is it?

32:50.677 --> 32:52.713
You've always done
what you believe to be right...

32:52.888 --> 32:55.425
Even if you knew your father
would disapprove of it.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.028
Do you not see how different
you are to him?

32:58.185 --> 33:01.052
Camelot's a better place
since you became king.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.895
Father clearly doesn't think so.

33:04.065 --> 33:07.307
The people believe in you, Arthur.

33:08.111 --> 33:11.353
That counts for nothing
if you don't believe in yourself.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.668
Check the storeroom.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.333
Arthur!

35:30.337 --> 35:31.998
Merlin.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.629
Merlin, is that you?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.053
Father?

36:52.293 --> 36:54.329
I know it's you, father.

37:04.931 --> 37:08.594
- Why are you doing this?
- I did not spend my entire life...

37:08.768 --> 37:12.352
Building this kingdom
to see my own son destroy it.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.269
- You tried to kill Guinevere.
- For your own good.

37:17.444 --> 37:20.231
How can a serving girl
understand what it means to queen?

37:20.405 --> 37:25.240
Guinevere is wise and strong,
and I trust her more than anyone.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.900
And that is your weakness.

37:27.537 --> 37:30.324
You put too much trust in other people.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.907
You and you alone must rule Camelot.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.792
I would rather not rule
at all than rule alone.

37:38.214 --> 37:43.425
Your whole life, I tried to prepare you
for the day you would become king.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.128
Did you learn nothing?

37:47.307 --> 37:48.968
I watched you rule.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.800
I learned that if you trust no one,
you'll always live in fear.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.560
Your hatred came from fear, not strength.

37:55.565 --> 37:56.771
How dare you?

37:56.941 --> 37:58.602
I loved and respected you...

37:58.777 --> 38:00.768
Obut I have to rule the kingdom
in my own way.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.020
I have to do what I believe to be right.

38:04.199 --> 38:07.862
I will not allow you to
destroy all that I built.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.617
Then you'll have to kill me.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.828
I'm not you, father.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.034
I can't rule the way you did.

38:17.879 --> 38:21.246
Camelot must come before all else.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.424
Even you.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.234
Merlin:
Get away from him, uther.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.238
You've caused enough harm.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.240
You don't belong here.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.698
You must return to the other world.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.989
This is my kingdom.

38:56.960 --> 39:01.704
You think you can drive me from it?
You are nothing but a serving boy.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.126
I'm much more than that.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.175
You have magic.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.272
I was born with it.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.183
I made you Arthur's servant.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.693
- You are a sorcerer.
- Even while you were king...

39:29.868 --> 39:31.779
There was magic at the heart of Camelot.

39:31.953 --> 39:36.242
I will not allow you and your kind
to poison my kingdom!

39:36.416 --> 39:37.747
You're wrong. You're wrong.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.374
About so much.

39:42.630 --> 39:46.589
Arthur is a better and more worthy king
than you ever were.

41:27.694 --> 41:31.061
It will give me great pleasure killing you.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.355
Father!

41:39.330 --> 41:41.036
Arthur.

41:41.207 --> 41:44.415
No please.

41:44.585 --> 41:47.167
Whatever I've done, I've done for Camelot.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.252
You've had your turn.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.251
Now it's mine.

41:57.807 --> 41:58.842
Merlin has...

42:20.455 --> 42:22.135
Arthur:
I've always looked up to my father.

42:23.332 --> 42:26.039
I admired and respected him
more than anyone.

42:27.003 --> 42:32.043
I have to accept that I can't please him,
be true to myself.

42:33.760 --> 42:37.628
Uther did what he thought he had to do
to protect the kingdom.

42:38.014 --> 42:40.221
It doesn't mean he was right.

42:43.102 --> 42:46.310
I want to build a kingdom
that's fair and just.

42:48.274 --> 42:51.391
One where everyone's respected,
regardless of rank.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.185
Does that include me?

42:55.698 --> 42:56.983
Of course.

42:57.158 --> 42:58.614
So

42:59.118 --> 43:01.734
Does that mean that you're not
going to hit me anymore?

43:01.913 --> 43:04.825
When do I ever hit you?
“All the time.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.290
That's not hitting, Merlin. That's...

43:08.461 --> 43:09.496
Merely friendly slaps.

43:09.670 --> 43:13.162
- It's horseplay.
- So can I give you a friendly slap?

43:13.341 --> 43:15.377
You can certainly try.

43:34.195 --> 43:35.560
What the hell was that?

43:37.281 --> 43:38.817
It was, um...

43:40.076 --> 43:41.566
Horseplay.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.738
No, Merlin.

43:48.543 --> 43:50.249
You're doing it all wrong.

43:51.212 --> 43:53.077
Why don't I show you?

44:05.059 --> 44:06.720
Princess mithian!

44:10.148 --> 44:12.890
I have no one else to
turn to but you, Arthur.

44:25.538 --> 44:28.655
You kill me and you'll have
all of Camelot to answer to.
