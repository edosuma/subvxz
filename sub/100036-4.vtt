Okay, look, Randall,
you're a very nice guy,

I know it's a Saturday.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.867
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.202
‐You probably have
other appointments...
‐We have 30 minutes

17:58.244 --> 17:59.870
before people start showing up,

17:59.912 --> 18:02.081
and we can't have an opening
with this horrible smell.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.208
Can you get rid of it?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.251
I'll try.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.004
Be tricky if it's a dead family.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.005
Please stop saying that.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.090
RONNY:
You got the keys
to the crawl space?

18:11.132 --> 18:12.425
BETH:
Come on. I'll show you.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.426
I'll come with you.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.885
RANDALL:
Oh, actually, Carol‐‐

18:14.927 --> 18:18.389
I mean, Mama C,
maybe you should...

18:18.431 --> 18:21.267
‐What's that smell?
‐Uh, air freshener

18:21.267 --> 18:22.268
and dead animal thing.

18:22.310 --> 18:26.105
Look, uh, Randall,
he's‐he's a really nice guy,

18:26.147 --> 18:28.524
‐but sometimes our jokes are...
‐Hey, hey, hey.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.276
It's all good.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.903
(exhales)
Okay.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.614
Mr. Pearson!

18:34.614 --> 18:36.073
Hey.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.868
Uh, Randall, this is Malik.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.119
Malik, this is my dad, Randall.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.287
Randall, please don't do
anything weird.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.955
The famous Malik!

18:42.997 --> 18:44.415
‐(chuckles)
‐My man.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.626
‐How's, uh...
‐(chuckles)

18:46.667 --> 18:48.294
‐Ni‐Nice to meet you, sir.
‐(chuckles) Yeah.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.296
‐Nice to meet you.
‐Nice to‐‐ nice to...

18:50.338 --> 18:51.422
Got you.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.466
(chuckles)
So, uh...

18:53.507 --> 18:56.218
(exhales) what‐what grade
are you in, Malik?

18:56.260 --> 18:58.220
Oh, I‐I'm a junior.
I'm a junior.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.306
Um, but‐but Deja's
in my math class,

19:00.348 --> 19:02.475
'cause she's, uh...
'cause she's kind of a genius,

19:02.516 --> 19:03.976
‐so... (chuckles)
‐(chuckles)

19:03.976 --> 19:06.562
‐Shut up.
‐(chuckling)

19:06.604 --> 19:08.648
‐Yeah, we're in agreement
on that one.
‐(chuckles): Yeah.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.274
You live nearby?

19:10.316 --> 19:11.275
Not too far. Not too far.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.153
My‐my dad, he owns
a body shop over on 29th.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.905
And, uh, Mom's a manager
down at the Marriott, so...

19:15.946 --> 19:17.490
Ah, the Marriott!

19:17.531 --> 19:18.574
‐Yeah.
‐I'm a rewards member.

19:18.616 --> 19:19.575
‐Yeah?
‐(clicks tongue)

19:19.617 --> 19:20.951
‐Yes, sir.
‐Okay. Okay, yeah.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.328
I'm sure my folks
would love to meet you.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.372
You know,
after Deja told me who you were,

19:24.413 --> 19:26.957
I read up on you, and...
I‐I really love

19:26.999 --> 19:28.334
the work you're doing
down at the rec center.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.961
Really important stuff. Really.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.091
All right, listen, man.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.343
I'm gonna level with you, Malik.

19:37.385 --> 19:41.347
We're new to town
and Deja's making new friends,

19:41.347 --> 19:44.600
including a boy who is
two grades older than her,

19:44.642 --> 19:47.520
and it's all a bit overwhelming
for my wife and me.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.689
(sighs dramatically)

19:49.730 --> 19:51.649
But, um...

19:51.691 --> 19:55.194
but it means a lot
that you came down to say hi.

19:55.236 --> 19:58.114
And I like the firm handshake
and the way you looked me

19:58.155 --> 20:00.199
in the eye
and the fact that I feel

20:00.241 --> 20:02.702
confident that I could
physically squash you like a bug

20:02.743 --> 20:04.036
if I needed to.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.371
Do you feel me?

20:05.413 --> 20:07.748
‐(chuckles) Yeah.
‐(chuckles)

20:07.790 --> 20:11.001
Yeah. No, no, no, man.
No, I get it. Really.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.670
Man, when my daughter
gets old enough,

20:12.712 --> 20:14.547
I plan on installing
a tracking device on her.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.132
‐(laughs)
‐So... (chuckles)

20:16.173 --> 20:18.050
‐Right. Right. Yeah.
‐No, really. Like, my daughter,

20:18.092 --> 20:20.553
she created this little
flirty smile the other day.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.971
Gave it to the mailman.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.181
Yo, I was freaking out.
(chuckles)

20:24.223 --> 20:25.516
Uh...

20:25.558 --> 20:27.518
I'm sorry,
when you say "my daughter,"

20:27.560 --> 20:30.688
what do you mean by those words?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.693
I thought...

20:35.735 --> 20:38.028
I just assumed she told you.

20:40.448 --> 20:43.033
Mr. Pearson, I have a daughter.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.660
Six months old.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.163
Janelle. Janelle.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.748
I have full custody,
and my‐my parents help out

20:48.789 --> 20:49.832
with her sometimes.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.337
BETH:
He thinks it's just one

20:55.379 --> 20:57.631
dead possum, baby,
not a dead family.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.266
You know
the dude's wasting your time.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.269
He's just in there
calling everyone he knows

21:10.311 --> 21:12.229
and saying that the Manny
is in his office.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.440
(chuckles)
It's all right.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.775
My uncle's probably
not gonna let me

21:15.775 --> 21:18.235
buy him one
of these things anyway.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.403
But what about you?

21:20.446 --> 21:21.781
I mean, I know you really needed

21:21.822 --> 21:24.074
that meeting this morning, huh?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.618
Tell you what, I feel like I
needed a meeting this morning

21:25.618 --> 21:27.286
after finding out
that my show got canceled.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.497
Don't try to relate to me.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.457
Talking about a television
show‐‐ a television show

21:31.499 --> 21:33.125
you're not even on anymore
getting canceled.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.585
My marriage is getting canceled.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.842
Can't imagine why, you're so
pleasant to be around.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.308
No. Wait.
You know what? No.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.143
Here's the thing.
Maybe I didn't fight in a war

21:51.185 --> 21:52.478
but I'm allowed
to have a crappy day

21:52.520 --> 21:54.605
just like everyone else, okay?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.482
Something that was really
important to me ended.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.442
And, yeah, I know it was
a little goofy, okay?

21:58.484 --> 21:59.819
But it was a big part
of my life,

21:59.860 --> 22:01.320
and when big things end,
it's hard not to imagine

22:01.320 --> 22:02.780
how they started, so, please,

22:02.822 --> 22:04.824
if you could just ease up
for maybe two seconds.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.493
Oh, my God, it is you.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.328
(laughs)

22:09.328 --> 22:11.372
‐Hey.
‐I'm sorry.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.374
My husband works here
and he texted me at the gym,

22:13.415 --> 22:14.875
and I just... you know.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.169
My God, can‐can I have a hug?

22:17.169 --> 22:18.295
Well, yes, of cour‐‐

22:18.337 --> 22:19.505
Oh, you're coming in.
All right.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.799
Hey. (chuckles)

22:21.841 --> 22:24.343
‐There you go.
‐(both laugh)

22:24.343 --> 22:25.344
What's your name?

22:25.386 --> 22:26.846
‐Gina.
‐Gina.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.139
My husband and I, we just
loved you on that show.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.183
‐Thank you.
‐You were wonderful.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.685
‐Thank you.
‐(laughs)

22:32.726 --> 22:34.353
Would it be okay
to get a selfie?

22:34.353 --> 22:35.563
Well, yes, of course.
Yeah, no.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.648
I was actually, I was just gonna
ask you if I could get one.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.317
‐(both laugh)
‐This is gonna work out great.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.819
‐There you go. Oh.
‐Uh‐oh.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.529
‐My hand's a little...
‐You know what? Check this out.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.322
Watch this.
Here we go, Gina.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.532
I got long arms, right?

22:46.574 --> 22:48.534
‐And...
‐(camera clicks)

22:48.576 --> 22:49.869
You tell me if you think
that looks good.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.704
I think you look gorgeous
in that.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.706
‐Oh, my God.
‐Yeah. You like it?

22:53.747 --> 22:54.915
I love it.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.417
Oh, thank you so much.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.335
You're welcome.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.880
‐(sighs): Oh...
‐Ooh, watch your back there,
Gina. All right.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.548
‐Thank you.
‐Good to meet you, Gina.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.425
‐Good to meet you.
‐(chuckles)

23:07.720 --> 23:09.430
You have a weird life.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.349
Don't we all?

23:12.391 --> 23:15.519
I've been a dick.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.564
Yeah, well, you know, it's...

23:21.400 --> 23:23.903
I‐I haven't fought in a war, but
I have been through a divorce.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.864
You know? And I'm not trying
to relate to you,

23:26.906 --> 23:28.574
it's just...

23:28.616 --> 23:31.577
it's a fact.

23:31.619 --> 23:34.246
It really sucks.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.586
We got engaged in Spain.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.422
(scoffs) I'd just finished
my first tour,

23:43.422 --> 23:45.424
fixing helicopters overseas,
and...

23:45.424 --> 23:47.551
I knew‐I knew
he was gonna propose,

23:47.593 --> 23:49.261
'cause he insisted
on meeting me there

23:49.261 --> 23:51.722
when my ship came into port
at Rota.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.266
And I saw his phone

23:54.266 --> 23:56.769
when his bonehead buddy Triconi
texted him saying,

23:56.769 --> 23:58.437
"Did you put
that ring on it yet?"

23:58.479 --> 24:01.273
And he knew.
He saw that I saw it,

24:01.315 --> 24:03.233
but we both pretended
like I didn't.

24:03.275 --> 24:07.446
So... I got a manicure.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.616
And then for four days,
he just messed with me.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.618
You know, he'd point out, like,
these old couples and be like,

24:12.660 --> 24:15.287
"Oh, God. I want to be
like them someday.

24:15.329 --> 24:16.830
They're so cute and in love."

24:16.872 --> 24:21.794
And he'd get real serious again
and be like...

24:21.794 --> 24:23.420
"Do you want to get a beer?"

24:23.462 --> 24:26.298
He did this for four days.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.300
He messed with me for four days.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.302
‐But eventually... Yeah.
‐He did it.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.638
You know, on a bridge
where his grandparents met,

24:32.638 --> 24:34.848
yada yada.
Nailed it.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.313
I just can't picture you
in a manicure.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.315
(laughs)
I know, right?

24:43.315 --> 24:44.775
Yeah.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.318
Uh, it was the first and last.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.612
(both laugh)

24:48.654 --> 24:52.491
So now we're just living
in this little rental condo

24:52.491 --> 24:54.660
until I can figure out
what to do.

24:54.660 --> 24:58.872
God. You lost your husband
and your home.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.541
I cannot imagine.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.460
And Randall was supposed
to go to Howard University,

25:03.502 --> 25:08.007
but he decided to stay
closer to home.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.300
He's had a tough year.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.343
We've all had a tough year.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.511
Oh, I understand.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.013
I lost my husband last year.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.889
What?

25:17.850 --> 25:19.351
I had no idea.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.354
I was just blabbing on.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.023
I am so sorry.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.986
H‐How is your family coping?

25:30.863 --> 25:33.532
Well, they are a tough bunch.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.702
Although, Bethany
was Daddy's girl.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.412
They were inseparable.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.836
Are we supposed to take off
our wedding rings?

25:45.878 --> 25:48.047
No, ma'am.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.548
I'm not taking off mine.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.550
Yeah, I'm not either.
I don't want to.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.511
No, no, no. Not unless
Harry Belafonte comes knocking.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.015
(both laugh)

25:58.057 --> 26:01.351
How do you seem so together?

26:03.604 --> 26:05.689
'Cause I just feel like
at a moment's notice

26:05.731 --> 26:08.734
I‐I could completely break.

26:08.776 --> 26:11.361
Well, I've got a job
that I love.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.571
Mm.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.865
A classroom
full of wonderful students

26:14.907 --> 26:16.742
who are counting on me
showing up every day

26:16.742 --> 26:19.369
to make them love books.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.123
My husband loved books.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.375
You know, we used to read
in bed.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.586
Although, usually,
he would only get a page in

26:27.628 --> 26:29.421
before he was snoring.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.548
(laughs): And I would lie there
for hours reading,

26:31.590 --> 26:34.426
listening to him snore.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.428
It was about a couple
of months ago I realized

26:36.470 --> 26:40.766
that I haven't read a book
before bed since he passed

26:40.808 --> 26:43.602
and I wondered how he would...

26:43.644 --> 26:46.772
well, what he would think.

26:46.772 --> 26:50.067
What he would think about me
if he knew I'd stopped reading.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.946
So I picked up a book
and started a new chapter

26:53.946 --> 26:56.657
in every sense of the phrase.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.078
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.497
Oh, hell no.
She's 14.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.624

who puts babies in people.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.459
We are in lockstep.

27:07.501 --> 27:10.129
Okay, so we have taped up
the dryer sheets to the vent

27:10.129 --> 27:11.964
and that is helping
with the smell.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.966
S‐Sort of‐‐ What's wrong?

27:14.007 --> 27:15.801
It's nothing to be
concerned about, just...

27:15.843 --> 27:17.636
‐Deja likes a boy
who has a baby.
‐It's that.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.972
But we're gonna put
an end to it tonight,

27:20.013 --> 27:21.473
so don't worry about it now,
okay?

27:21.515 --> 27:24.101
Everything is gonna be
just fine.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.144
So there's no way
to get rid of the carcass

27:26.144 --> 27:28.605
without opening up
the entire wall.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.107
You just gotta let it decompose.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.609
The smell will fade away
in about a week or two.

Mm, no.
