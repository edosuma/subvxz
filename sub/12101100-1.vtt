01:02.897 --> 01:05.065
I think
about you all the time.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.636
The kind of life you
might be leading.

01:09.871 --> 01:11.839
I wonder what you're doing.

01:11.873 --> 01:13.206
Right now, for example.

01:14.876 --> 01:17.144
Sometimes I think about
the day we'll meet

01:17.177 --> 01:19.112
and what that will be like.

01:19.814 --> 01:20.848
The moment we see each other

01:20.882 --> 01:22.517
for the very first time.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.753
I imagine it taking place here

01:25.787 --> 01:29.156
on the seawall on
a day like this.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.225
And then I imagine us walking

01:32.259 --> 01:35.162
to the light house
and just talking.

01:36.531 --> 01:39.867
About your life and the things
that have happened here.

01:39.901 --> 01:42.402
I'd really like to build
up memories like that.

01:44.204 --> 01:47.274
By the way, do you
ever think about me?

03:25.338 --> 03:26.941
Welcome everyone.

03:29.376 --> 03:34.015
In a recent survey
98% of vets questioned

03:34.048 --> 03:36.784
said they'd been asked to
euthanize healthy pets.

03:37.752 --> 03:39.821
And in nearly all those cases

03:39.854 --> 03:42.355
bad behavior is
the reason given.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.325
Question, how do we deal
with such ethical dilemmas?

03:45.358 --> 03:47.795
And just to be clear,
this isn't some

03:47.829 --> 03:48.863
theoretical question about

03:48.896 --> 03:50.998
a situation that you won't
ever find yourself in.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.518
What time is it?

04:45.052 --> 04:45.887
I'm late.

04:46.821 --> 04:49.356
My dad, he's gonna kill me.

05:55.990 --> 05:57.357
Hello?

05:59.760 --> 06:00.561
Hello.

06:03.898 --> 06:04.899
Who is this?

07:07.228 --> 07:09.630
Derry, do you want to say
your last goodbye to Betty?

07:18.773 --> 07:21.075
So we're gonna administer
the injection now,

07:22.043 --> 07:23.511
she won't be in anymore pain.

07:27.081 --> 07:29.951
Okay, she'll experience
a shortening of breath

07:29.984 --> 07:31.619
and perhaps a
dryness of the mouth,

07:31.652 --> 07:33.988
but that's quiet normal Derry.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.456
Just a sign that the drug
is beginning to take effect.

08:00.281 --> 08:01.481
Rose.

08:03.184 --> 08:05.119
That's it Derry,
it's all over.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.752
You okay?

08:43.324 --> 08:44.191
That was hard.

08:45.326 --> 08:47.628
You'll have to toughen up.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.529
I know.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.200
When I volunteered
in the summer,

08:54.368 --> 08:58.305
I did a border collie, a poodle,

08:58.339 --> 09:01.776
three or four cats, two
rabbits, and a ferret.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.278
Really?

09:04.311 --> 09:06.280
Trust me, okay, you stop.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.376
I'll get that.

09:40.081 --> 09:40.915
Hello?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.351
Is this Ellen Wise?

09:45.252 --> 09:46.087
Yes.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.889
Formerly Ellen Bern?

09:53.227 --> 09:54.628
Love, I just need a minute.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.073
Who is this?

10:07.308 --> 10:08.342
My name is Rose.

10:10.311 --> 10:11.145
Okay.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.950
Does the name Julie
mean anything to you?

10:17.218 --> 10:18.385
Why?

10:18.419 --> 10:20.387
It's the name on
my birth certificate.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.993
I know from my adoption files
you requested no contact,

10:26.026 --> 10:28.262
and I really shouldn't
be calling like this,

10:28.295 --> 10:31.765
but I didn't know
what else to do.

10:34.101 --> 10:34.935
Hello?

10:38.472 --> 10:39.907
Hello, can you hear me?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.100
I like the name, Julie.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.302
When I think about Julie

11:08.335 --> 11:12.039
I picture her like
me but different.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.276
Different clothes, different
accent, different hair.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.311
For some reason, I
always imagined her

11:17.344 --> 11:19.747
with short hair and
I don't know why.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.185
I can't help thinking
that somehow,

11:25.419 --> 11:28.122
if you had managed
to hold onto me,

11:28.155 --> 11:30.357
I'd be living a
different life right now.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.760
I'd be this other person.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.830
Perhaps the person who I
was really meant to be,

11:37.532 --> 11:38.732
the real me.

12:29.383 --> 12:30.017
Hey dad.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.354
I'm sorry, I should have called,

12:33.387 --> 12:34.989
it's just been really busy here.

12:36.558 --> 12:37.424
How's Lottie?

12:40.394 --> 12:41.195
That's good.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.098
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:45.266 --> 12:48.503
We're doing a module
on euthanasia.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.138
Yesterday we had
to put down a dog.

12:52.339 --> 12:56.110
Yeah, I think the
next one is a horse.

12:58.546 --> 12:59.514
Yeah, it is.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.350
It's really tough.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.356
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:10.592 --> 13:12.059
Yeah, I'm sleeping fine.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.930
Actually, I meant to call you.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.799
I'm going to London on Thursday.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.570
No, it's just for the day.

13:24.606 --> 13:28.543
To a conference on epidemiology.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.985
Yeah, it should be interesting.

13:40.120 --> 13:40.954
I will.

13:43.625 --> 13:44.458
Okay.

13:47.529 --> 13:48.596
Love you to.

18:16.798 --> 18:21.803
Hi, I was calling to see
about one of your properties.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.640
I was just wondering if I
could arrange a viewing.

18:28.910 --> 18:30.377
Yeah, I'll hold, no problem.

18:38.886 --> 18:41.656
Yeah, the house
on Windsor Avenue.

18:43.625 --> 18:44.892
My name is Rosa O'Connor.

18:46.193 --> 18:49.162
At anytime today would be ideal.

18:54.535 --> 18:56.604
3:30 with Valerie.

19:28.936 --> 19:31.606
hi, I'm here for the viewing.

19:31.639 --> 19:33.240
I called Valerie earlier.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.242
Yes, she's on the
phone right now.

19:35.977 --> 19:37.210
Oh, okay.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.782
You could come
in and wait if you'd like.

19:41.983 --> 19:42.784
Yeah, sure.

19:51.559 --> 19:53.326
This is a really nice house.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.204
Is that you and your mom?

20:09.510 --> 20:10.978
You look like her.

20:11.012 --> 20:12.479
Think so?

20:12.513 --> 20:13.748
Yeah.

20:13.781 --> 20:16.283
Everyone
says like my dad.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.451
They're separated.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.890
My name's Rose by the way.

20:24.058 --> 20:25.727
Eva.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.995
Eva, that's nice.

20:32.066 --> 20:34.969
I have some revision to do so.

20:35.002 --> 20:37.905
Okay, yeah, yeah
don't worry about me.

20:39.874 --> 20:40.675
Okay.

20:42.810 --> 20:47.648
Actually, can I
ask you something?

20:51.085 --> 20:52.285
What age are you?

20:53.921 --> 20:55.656
I'm 16.

20:58.358 --> 20:58.993
I see.

21:00.094 --> 21:01.028
Thanks.

21:40.034 --> 21:40.868
Rose?

21:43.004 --> 21:45.072
It's Valerie, hi.

21:45.106 --> 21:48.009
And this is Ellen, the
owner of the property.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.981
Hi.

21:54.015 --> 21:55.883
You've already met
Ellen's daughter, Eva.

21:55.917 --> 21:56.784
Yeah, I have.

21:58.119 --> 21:59.854
Shall we make a start?

22:01.522 --> 22:02.890
That's okay with you Ellen?

22:02.924 --> 22:05.593
Yes, yup, that's fine.

22:05.626 --> 22:08.461
I was about to
suggest that we start upstairs.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.798
Yeah, great.

22:13.067 --> 22:14.836
This was the original
show house when

22:14.869 --> 22:16.403
they built the development.

22:17.104 --> 22:17.939
Ellen has made a few changes

22:17.972 --> 22:20.340
but she's kept a
lot of the features.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.844
The fireplace in the hallway,

22:22.877 --> 22:25.345
which I'm sure you
noted, and the wallpaper.

22:35.690 --> 22:37.124
Are you really looking
to buy the house?

22:37.158 --> 22:38.593
Why do you ask?

22:39.994 --> 22:41.762
Well it's just,
you look a little young

22:41.796 --> 22:44.632
and I, I really don't wanna
waste anyone's time here.

23:02.183 --> 23:05.786
The thing is you're right.

23:09.724 --> 23:14.427
I'm looking on behalf of.

23:15.196 --> 23:16.396
What?

23:19.466 --> 23:20.433
A client.

23:28.542 --> 23:31.779
So how many square
feet is the property?

23:33.214 --> 23:34.414
3,000.

23:40.487 --> 23:41.722
Can we see Eva's room now?

23:59.073 --> 24:00.241
Valerie.

24:00.274 --> 24:02.910
I was just about to point
out the ample storage space.

24:02.944 --> 24:04.512
Could I have a word?

24:04.545 --> 24:05.513
Sure.

24:05.546 --> 24:06.446
Outside, please.

24:35.643 --> 24:36.944
I don't want an argument.

24:36.978 --> 24:37.778
Neither do it.

24:37.812 --> 24:39.747
Good, that's good.

24:39.780 --> 24:40.881
You need to leave now.

24:40.915 --> 24:42.083
What if I say no?

24:42.116 --> 24:44.251
You just said you
didn't want an argument.

24:44.285 --> 24:46.253
I just don't, I don't
want to cause any trouble.

24:46.287 --> 24:48.055
I just want to talk, that's all.

24:49.156 --> 24:50.257
Mum.

24:50.291 --> 24:51.759
My flight leaves at nine.

24:51.792 --> 24:53.260
Then I'll be gone.

25:11.779 --> 25:14.215
When I need to be on my
own, getaway from things,

25:14.248 --> 25:15.149
this where I come.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.518
Do you like walking?

25:20.621 --> 25:21.555
Not particularly.

25:23.057 --> 25:23.824
Well it's good for you.

25:23.858 --> 25:24.992
It's good for stress.

25:26.961 --> 25:28.062
Calms you down.

25:30.297 --> 25:31.699
That's the theory at least.

25:33.334 --> 25:34.702
I should take it up then.

25:37.605 --> 25:38.906
Can I ask you something?

25:40.274 --> 25:41.108
Okay.

25:44.378 --> 25:47.815
Eva, did you say
anything to her?

25:49.350 --> 25:50.151
No.

25:51.385 --> 25:53.120
Cause she knows
nothing about you.

25:55.623 --> 25:56.657
Nobody does.

26:03.998 --> 26:04.832
Listen.

26:06.767 --> 26:07.835
That's a nightingale.

26:34.095 --> 26:35.262
I was raped.

26:42.169 --> 26:44.004
So, that's it.

27:50.204 --> 27:51.772
How did it happen?

27:53.508 --> 27:54.675
Or can you tell me?

28:04.818 --> 28:07.154
I was in my early thirties.

28:09.490 --> 28:13.427
Things weren't so great for me.

28:14.495 --> 28:16.063
To take my mind off things

28:16.096 --> 28:18.999
I volunteered for an
archeological dig.

28:20.801 --> 28:22.803
I thought it'd be interesting.

28:22.836 --> 28:24.271
And the site was out

28:24.305 --> 28:29.076
by the coast and it backed
onto this golf course.

28:39.521 --> 28:44.725
And it was summer and he was.

28:57.238 --> 29:00.107
Sorry, I'm sorry,
I can't, I can't.

29:16.957 --> 29:19.393
I need to know
who he is, his name.

29:22.863 --> 29:23.931
Why?

29:25.432 --> 29:28.335
Because I think I
have a right to know.

29:28.369 --> 29:30.904
And if I tell you his
name what will you do?

29:30.938 --> 29:31.772
Nothing.

29:32.940 --> 29:35.075
I just want the
name, that's all.

29:41.482 --> 29:42.783
After all this time.

29:46.186 --> 29:47.921
I can't say the name.

29:55.329 --> 29:57.498
Can you write it?

31:46.974 --> 31:48.676
I've always imagined
different scenarios

31:48.710 --> 31:50.944
as to why I might've
been adopted.

31:52.279 --> 31:56.316
One was of two young people,
teenagers who were in love,

31:56.350 --> 31:58.085
expecting their first child,

31:59.554 --> 32:02.923
but they'd realized they'd
made a mistake and panicked.

32:05.259 --> 32:09.496
A part of me has always
held onto the idea that

32:10.665 --> 32:14.001
whatever the reason,
at least I was wanted.

32:15.637 --> 32:19.507
I wasn't the problem,
it wasn't my fault.

32:20.742 --> 32:23.511
It wasn't because of what I was.

32:23.545 --> 32:28.550
Some operation,
which is what I have.

33:21.101 --> 33:22.369
So from the initial report,

33:22.402 --> 33:25.072
we know that she died
from an infectious disease

33:25.105 --> 33:27.709
specific to ruminants,
which in turn

33:27.742 --> 33:29.443
she passed on to her offspring.

33:30.612 --> 33:34.181
Our job, your job
is to ascertain

33:34.214 --> 33:35.550
the nature of that disease.

33:36.483 --> 33:38.786
So as you examine each organ

33:38.820 --> 33:42.489
I want you to feed back
on your observations.

33:42.524 --> 33:47.529
Size, color, swellings,
unusual lesions.

33:48.395 --> 33:50.464
Yeah, okay.

33:50.497 --> 33:51.833
Jump in, don't be shy.

34:48.890 --> 34:50.290
Fuck you.

36:26.020 --> 36:27.755
I can't say the name.

36:30.490 --> 36:31.993
Can you write it?

37:33.353 --> 37:37.558
Hi, I'm calling about the
book launch this evening.

37:39.093 --> 37:39.894
Yeah, could you tell me where

37:39.927 --> 37:41.896
exactly it's taking
place please?

37:43.765 --> 37:45.733
Okay, okay great.

37:45.767 --> 37:48.268
And do I need a ticket or?

37:49.804 --> 37:51.639
Okay, thank you.

39:00.842 --> 39:01.676
Interesting?

39:04.045 --> 39:09.050
It's about a nun who
has psychic powers.

39:09.650 --> 39:10.551
Seriously?

39:11.786 --> 39:13.788
It's not bad actually.

39:16.423 --> 39:17.725
I called your dad

39:17.758 --> 39:19.660
and I told him
you'd be over later.

39:20.862 --> 39:23.731
How long will
you be in Dublin?

39:23.764 --> 39:24.699
Not long.

39:25.967 --> 39:27.367
It's a small part.

39:32.974 --> 39:37.979
Sweet pea, that girl Rose
who came to view the house.

39:39.113 --> 39:39.947
Yeah.

39:41.983 --> 39:43.618
That's not her real name.

39:47.889 --> 39:50.691
Before she used to
be called Julie.

40:55.022 --> 40:55.823
Hi.

40:56.824 --> 40:58.092
Hi.

40:58.125 --> 41:01.529
I'm looking for Peter Doyle.

41:01.562 --> 41:03.264
Could you tell me where he is?

41:03.297 --> 41:04.765
Yeah, Peter.

41:11.706 --> 41:13.207
See those two guys over there?

41:14.308 --> 41:15.943
He's the one in the dark jacket.

41:17.078 --> 41:18.679
Yeah, I see him.

41:19.647 --> 41:20.480
Thank you.

41:51.779 --> 41:52.580
Excuse me.

41:54.749 --> 41:55.616
Excuse me.

41:57.818 --> 42:00.287
I was wondering if I could
volunteer for the dig.

42:01.589 --> 42:06.594
Okay, have you
got any experience?

42:08.796 --> 42:13.801
No, it's just, I got
this part in a play.

42:14.869 --> 42:17.104
My character is an archeologist.

42:17.138 --> 42:18.839
So you're an actress?

42:18.873 --> 42:20.141
Yeah.

42:20.174 --> 42:23.611
So I was hoping, if
it's okay that is

42:23.644 --> 42:26.580
if I could spend
some time on the dig.

42:26.614 --> 42:30.918
Sorta like, for the play
kind of background research.

42:30.951 --> 42:32.286
Yeah, exactly.

42:37.091 --> 42:38.859
Yeah, I mean can you
come back tomorrow?

42:38.893 --> 42:39.727
Sure.

42:40.961 --> 42:43.197
Sorry, I should have
asked your name, I'm Peter.

42:45.866 --> 42:46.700
Julie

42:52.006 --> 42:53.741
What's the play called?

42:55.976 --> 42:59.046
It's called The Archeologist.

43:01.782 --> 43:03.918
You're
the archeologists?

43:03.951 --> 43:04.752
Yes.

43:58.706 --> 43:59.773
Okay, come on.

44:02.443 --> 44:04.678
Just push your
hands in the front.

44:04.712 --> 44:05.746
Come on, come on.

44:05.779 --> 44:08.415
You can stay in
the corner there.

44:29.036 --> 44:30.471
Okay.

44:30.505 --> 44:32.173
Everybody happy?

44:32.206 --> 44:34.341
We've rechecked the
way of the horse.

44:34.375 --> 44:35.743
We're good with our calculations

44:35.776 --> 44:37.912
as to the volume
of pentobarbital?

44:37.945 --> 44:39.246
Yes.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.114
Okay.

44:41.916 --> 44:43.884
Now don't forget,
only when the horse

44:43.918 --> 44:46.187
is properly secured
for euthanasia,

44:46.220 --> 44:47.788
can we begin the procedure.

45:01.268 --> 45:03.003
I think if it were me,

45:03.037 --> 45:04.705
I would have had an abortion.

45:07.509 --> 45:08.776
I thought about it.

45:10.878 --> 45:11.779
Came close.

45:13.280 --> 45:16.183
I'm sitting alone
in the waiting room.

45:17.284 --> 45:18.852
That's when I
decided to have you

45:20.187 --> 45:23.924
so that instead of
thinking about him

45:23.958 --> 45:27.461
and what he did, I
could think about you.

45:29.496 --> 45:33.734
Out there somewhere and the
life you might be leading.

45:37.104 --> 45:38.439
I thought if I could do that,

45:38.472 --> 45:42.076
then maybe I might
salvage something good.

47:13.601 --> 47:14.868
Hi, it's me.

47:17.137 --> 47:20.974
I'm here in Dublin,
working on something.

47:21.942 --> 47:22.943
A costume drama.

47:26.514 --> 47:30.084
If you're free, I thought
maybe we could meet up.

47:32.654 --> 47:33.854
I'd like that.

47:35.657 --> 47:37.257
Okay.

48:35.249 --> 48:36.950
That's
really good work.

48:37.719 --> 48:38.686
You're a quick learner.

48:38.720 --> 48:39.554
Thank you.

48:40.755 --> 48:41.922
That's okay.

48:42.857 --> 48:45.426
Could you want me to
stay a little longer or,

48:45.459 --> 48:46.927
so you got the hang of it?

48:48.128 --> 48:49.463
I'm fine, thanks.

48:50.565 --> 48:51.699
That's great.

48:58.740 --> 49:01.375
Okay, I'll leave you to it then.

49:35.743 --> 49:37.077
What's he like?

49:37.110 --> 49:38.111
Who?

49:38.145 --> 49:38.979
Doyle.

49:40.113 --> 49:41.549
Oh Peter.

49:41.583 --> 49:44.051
You've worked with
him before, right?

49:44.084 --> 49:45.219
Yeah, he's nice.

49:47.555 --> 49:48.388
Why do you ask?

49:51.258 --> 49:53.728
No reason, just curious.

50:12.479 --> 50:13.280
Hey.

50:13.313 --> 50:14.448
Hey.

50:14.481 --> 50:15.315
I'm sweaty.

50:16.684 --> 50:19.119
Did anyone notice
I was missing today?

50:19.152 --> 50:20.454
Yeah, I did.

50:21.823 --> 50:23.056
It's okay.

50:23.090 --> 50:24.592
I covered for you again.

50:26.293 --> 50:27.227
What's this?

50:29.631 --> 50:32.065
That's just for a party.

50:33.233 --> 50:34.301
What party?

50:37.872 --> 50:41.709
Not a specific party,
just if one were to come up,

50:41.743 --> 50:43.845
I thought I'd buy a wig.

50:43.878 --> 50:47.615
So like a wig party?

50:47.649 --> 50:48.448
Yeah.

50:51.686 --> 50:52.654
What do you think?

50:53.821 --> 50:55.222
Not sure it's really you.

50:58.325 --> 51:01.128
There was a lady
here looking for you.

51:01.161 --> 51:02.329
Who?

51:02.362 --> 51:03.531
She didn't say.

51:04.398 --> 51:05.232
Where is she?

51:07.234 --> 51:08.703
She's in your room.

51:08.736 --> 51:09.571
Really?

51:15.877 --> 51:20.882
Your friend, Molly,
yeah, she let me in.

51:24.752 --> 51:25.853
She seems nice.

51:28.188 --> 51:28.856
She is.

51:31.191 --> 51:32.527
I played a vet once.

51:34.194 --> 51:35.262
Yeah, I know.

51:36.898 --> 51:37.765
How'd I do?

51:39.299 --> 51:41.134
You did okay.

51:42.804 --> 51:44.137
That bad huh?

51:50.477 --> 51:53.347
That's the hotel
where I'm staying.

51:56.283 --> 51:57.117
I know it.

51:58.753 --> 52:02.356
It's odd to be back
after all these years.

52:05.459 --> 52:07.160
I never thought I
would come back.

52:09.229 --> 52:09.897
Why did you?

52:11.264 --> 52:12.734
I came back because of you.

52:22.242 --> 52:23.243
Is that you?

52:24.244 --> 52:25.680
Yeah.

52:25.713 --> 52:27.915
That photo was actually taken

52:27.949 --> 52:30.350
the day my parents
told me I was adopted.

52:31.753 --> 52:34.154
We went for a walk to
the lighthouse afterward.

52:35.990 --> 52:39.292
And my mum, she wanted
to take a picture of me.

52:40.427 --> 52:43.665
She asked me to turn
around, but I wouldn't.

52:46.433 --> 52:47.467
I don't know why.

52:51.371 --> 52:52.674
But I just, I couldn't.

52:59.446 --> 53:00.882
She passed away two years ago.

53:03.651 --> 53:04.652
What was her name?

53:05.787 --> 53:06.621
Patsy.

53:08.556 --> 53:09.389
Patsy.

53:11.993 --> 53:14.729
I think you's two would've
gotten on really well.

53:21.035 --> 53:22.369
Can I ask you something?

53:24.471 --> 53:25.305
Yeah.

53:28.308 --> 53:29.309
Have you seen him?

53:30.712 --> 53:31.546
No.

53:34.015 --> 53:36.617
Yes, I have.

53:37.785 --> 53:39.854
From a distance a
couple of times.

53:42.023 --> 53:43.191
I see.

53:44.324 --> 53:48.462
But, haven't spoken to him or?

53:48.495 --> 53:49.697
No, not yet.

53:52.700 --> 53:53.534
Not yet?

53:57.337 --> 53:58.405
Doesn't it bother you?

54:00.875 --> 54:05.680
That he's out there, acting
as if nothing happened?

54:08.049 --> 54:11.018
Is he?

54:11.052 --> 54:12.720
That's how it looked to me.

54:15.056 --> 54:17.658
And I am struggling,
really struggling

54:20.460 --> 54:22.530
with how that makes me feel.

56:01.562 --> 56:02.163
Okay.

56:02.196 --> 56:03.164
Turn around.

56:03.197 --> 56:04.632
Okay, okay, so.

56:05.900 --> 56:08.736
Kiss passionately, bravely.

56:08.769 --> 56:09.637
The baron.

56:09.670 --> 56:10.872
What about him?

56:10.905 --> 56:11.873
Consider madam,
the difficulty.

56:11.906 --> 56:12.740
I have considered it.

56:12.773 --> 56:13.608
And your child to.

56:13.641 --> 56:14.842
Yes, and the child to.

56:14.876 --> 56:17.044
You would risk,
you would risk,

56:17.078 --> 56:18.880
just give us that
line, will you?

56:18.913 --> 56:21.015
Yes, yes, and the child to.

56:21.048 --> 56:22.482
You would risk
all of this for me?

56:22.516 --> 56:23.383
I would.

56:31.225 --> 56:33.493
Come on down, take a look.

56:33.527 --> 56:34.394
Sure.

56:49.810 --> 56:51.411
What do you think that is?

56:53.781 --> 56:55.182
Looks like an animal bone.

56:56.951 --> 57:00.788
A dog or small bore maybe.

57:00.821 --> 57:04.792
You know I was
thinking I'm going

57:04.825 --> 57:06.994
to have to take this
sample in for testing.

57:07.028 --> 57:10.798
And I thought only
if you wanted to,

57:10.831 --> 57:12.767
maybe we could meet up

57:12.800 --> 57:15.435
and talk in greater detail
about the work that we do.

57:17.104 --> 57:18.506
Give you more insight.

57:19.907 --> 57:21.709
Just thought that
might be useful.

57:21.742 --> 57:22.643
What do you think?

57:25.212 --> 57:27.715
Yeah, I think I'd like that.

57:28.849 --> 57:29.650
Good.

57:33.220 --> 57:34.055
Sh.

57:38.159 --> 57:39.226
Beautiful eh?

57:46.233 --> 57:49.036
You wouldn't believe the
damage they can do to our work.

58:54.835 --> 58:56.637
So you've never
been here before?

58:58.339 --> 59:01.976
Actually yeah, once before
on a school trip years ago.

59:04.211 --> 59:06.580
What did you make
of the exhibits?

59:06.614 --> 59:08.916
Pretty interesting,
don't you think?

59:08.949 --> 59:10.051
Yeah, I do.

59:11.385 --> 59:12.286
I mean, they're there.

59:12.319 --> 59:14.655
They're just right
there in front of us.

59:15.856 --> 59:19.627
Yet they possess
all of this history.

59:21.062 --> 59:25.099
You know I think that's what
I'm most drawn to in my work.

59:27.001 --> 59:29.103
Unlocking the past.

59:29.136 --> 59:29.970
Why?

59:32.406 --> 59:33.574
I don't know exactly.

59:37.945 --> 59:39.580
Oh, before I forgot.

59:44.085 --> 59:46.153
Now this photo is
a publishers idea

59:46.187 --> 59:49.657
so it's a little embarrassing.

59:50.658 --> 59:51.459
There you go.

59:54.995 --> 59:58.699
No, I think you
look really good.

59:58.732 --> 1:00:00.167
Really?

1:00:01.268 --> 1:00:02.736
Do you think you look good?

1:00:04.071 --> 1:00:05.606
Is that a trick question?

1:00:07.041 --> 1:00:08.242
Yeah, it is.

1:00:18.886 --> 1:00:21.689
Just in case you
ever need to call me.

1:00:21.722 --> 1:00:23.691
I mean you never know,
just put it in your phone.

1:00:30.698 --> 1:00:31.699
Can I say something?

1:00:33.067 --> 1:00:33.901
Sure.

1:00:35.136 --> 1:00:35.970
Your hair.

1:00:36.904 --> 1:00:37.938
What about it?

1:00:38.906 --> 1:00:39.840
I really like it.

1:00:41.709 --> 1:00:45.446
The color the style, it
just really suits you.

1:00:45.479 --> 1:00:47.681
Suits your face,
shape of your face.

1:00:49.950 --> 1:00:50.851
Why are we here?

1:00:52.953 --> 1:00:54.188
Excuse me.

1:00:54.221 --> 1:00:55.823
Why did you ask
me to come here?

1:00:58.993 --> 1:01:00.794
I just wanted you to
know how pleased I am

1:01:00.828 --> 1:01:03.430
that you volunteered
to work on the dig.

1:01:03.464 --> 1:01:05.900
I mean, I know you just,
you know, this research

1:01:05.933 --> 1:01:10.938
for this acting thing, but
you've got this natural ability.

1:01:14.208 --> 1:01:15.676
You're really good.

1:01:16.410 --> 1:01:17.778
Really, that's all?

1:01:19.046 --> 1:01:19.880
Yeah.

1:01:26.053 --> 1:01:27.688
Can I ask you a question?

1:01:28.523 --> 1:01:29.723
Sure.

1:01:31.492 --> 1:01:32.860
What weight are you?

1:01:47.542 --> 1:01:52.713
I'm going up now.

1:01:54.181 --> 1:01:55.816
Goodnight.

1:06:13.173 --> 1:06:13.775
Julie.

1:06:13.808 --> 1:06:15.743
HI, I was in the area

1:06:15.777 --> 1:06:17.978
and I thought I'd
stop by, say hello.

1:06:19.246 --> 1:06:21.315
How did you know
where I lived?

1:06:21.348 --> 1:06:25.753
I called your
office and here I am.

1:06:25.787 --> 1:06:26.987
Come on in.

1:06:29.223 --> 1:06:30.991
Just go straight through there.

1:06:48.843 --> 1:06:50.043
Your wife?

1:06:51.078 --> 1:06:52.279
Yeah, that's Teresa.

1:06:58.653 --> 1:06:59.787
Your sons?

1:06:59.821 --> 1:07:01.188
Yeah, well no.

1:07:01.221 --> 1:07:03.825
They're Theresa sons,
Thomas and Shaun,

1:07:03.858 --> 1:07:06.026
but they do see me
as their father.

1:07:08.730 --> 1:07:10.130
We met when they were young.

1:07:15.402 --> 1:07:18.506
Do you have any
brothers and sisters?

1:07:20.140 --> 1:07:21.275
I do.

1:07:21.308 --> 1:07:24.612
Yeah, I have a
younger sister, Eva.

1:07:25.580 --> 1:07:26.413
That's nice.

1:07:27.515 --> 1:07:28.348
It is.

1:07:34.187 --> 1:07:35.389
You have a lovely home.

1:07:35.422 --> 1:07:39.159
Thank you, except it's
really Teresa's home.

1:07:40.127 --> 1:07:41.228
Oh?

1:07:41.261 --> 1:07:42.496
Yeah, her parents
built it for her

1:07:42.530 --> 1:07:44.566
and her first husband
when they got married.

1:07:46.768 --> 1:07:48.268
Wow.

1:07:48.302 --> 1:07:49.571
What?

1:07:51.204 --> 1:07:53.440
I don't know, all of this

1:07:57.545 --> 1:07:59.446
just makes me think
how lucky you are.

1:08:00.882 --> 1:08:02.750
Yeah, I never really
thought about that before.

1:08:02.784 --> 1:08:03.651
Really?

1:08:03.685 --> 1:08:04.519
No.

1:08:07.622 --> 1:08:10.157
Would you mind telling
me where your bathroom is?

1:08:11.291 --> 1:08:14.428
Yeah, sure, it's
upstairs on the left.

1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:41.248
I'm in here.

1:09:48.956 --> 1:09:49.791
You were right.

1:09:51.358 --> 1:09:51.959
About what?

1:09:51.993 --> 1:09:53.528
About me being lucky.

1:09:54.996 --> 1:09:58.700
To have this home to live in.

1:10:00.001 --> 1:10:02.202
You know, Theresa,
the boys, my work.

1:10:03.671 --> 1:10:06.507
I do think about it, you know,
I don't take it for granted.

1:10:08.609 --> 1:10:13.213
Do you know what the really
great thing is about my work?

1:10:15.449 --> 1:10:16.984
The surprises it brings.

1:10:18.485 --> 1:10:19.319
Like what?

1:10:20.822 --> 1:10:25.827
Like a rare artifact for
example, or someone like you.

1:10:35.435 --> 1:10:36.537
Am I embarrassing you?

1:10:38.873 --> 1:10:39.674
No.

1:10:41.609 --> 1:10:42.844
You know,

1:10:42.877 --> 1:10:44.679
it's funny you being
here, don't you think?

1:10:44.712 --> 1:10:45.580
Funny how?

1:10:46.948 --> 1:10:49.316
Well people
might be forgiven

1:10:49.349 --> 1:10:52.019
for thinking that there's
something going on.

1:10:52.053 --> 1:10:53.420
But nothing is going on.

1:10:53.453 --> 1:10:54.055
Really?

1:10:54.088 --> 1:10:55.990
No.

1:10:56.023 --> 1:11:00.928
An attractive young woman
alone with a man in his house.

1:11:02.930 --> 1:11:06.567
In the middle of the day,
when his wife is out.

1:11:09.737 --> 1:11:11.471
Do you see what I'm getting at?

1:11:13.674 --> 1:11:14.575
Yeah, I do.

1:11:15.777 --> 1:11:17.512
Can you recall
when we first met?

1:11:19.547 --> 1:11:20.181
Yeah.

1:11:21.348 --> 1:11:22.917
Can you recall an attraction?

1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:26.754
I can.

1:11:29.524 --> 1:11:31.826
Isn't that why you've
come around to my house?

1:11:35.563 --> 1:11:36.396
To see me?

1:11:37.397 --> 1:11:40.433
No.

1:11:40.467 --> 1:11:41.068
No?

1:11:41.102 --> 1:11:42.069
No.

1:11:45.740 --> 1:11:50.711
I think that really,
deep down, you want this.

1:11:54.615 --> 1:11:55.415
Stop.

1:11:56.818 --> 1:11:59.086
In fact, I think you've
wanted this since we first met.

1:11:59.120 --> 1:12:01.488
No, just stop.

1:12:01.522 --> 1:12:03.356
Listen, I want you to stop.

1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:06.894
You know what?

1:12:06.928 --> 1:12:08.395
I don't think I will stop.

1:12:40.962 --> 1:12:42.429
Fuck.

1:12:42.462 --> 1:12:45.766
When someone says stop you stop!

1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:48.970
And one more thing,
you are my father!

1:14:00.708 --> 1:14:01.542
Stop.

1:14:13.921 --> 1:14:16.691
When someone says
stop, you stop!

1:14:18.225 --> 1:14:21.562
And one more thing,
you are my father!

1:14:42.883 --> 1:14:44.285
Does he know who you are?

1:14:44.318 --> 1:14:45.186
No.

1:14:46.587 --> 1:14:47.989
Who does he think you are?

1:14:49.857 --> 1:14:52.193
He thinks I'm
someone called Julie.

1:14:54.295 --> 1:14:56.163
And that Julia is his daughter.

1:14:57.765 --> 1:14:59.967
You know I would have done it

1:15:01.335 --> 1:15:04.271
if the syringe hadn't broken,
I would have put him down.

1:15:04.305 --> 1:15:05.239
I wanted to.

1:15:07.008 --> 1:15:07.842
Okay.

1:15:08.943 --> 1:15:11.145
Did you tell Eva about me?

1:15:11.178 --> 1:15:13.280
Yes, I told her
she has a sister.

1:15:13.314 --> 1:15:14.582
And that's all?

1:15:14.615 --> 1:15:15.716
That's all.

1:15:17.318 --> 1:15:21.722
I'm not sure that I want
her to know everything.

1:15:21.756 --> 1:15:24.091
Not what I am.

1:15:26.660 --> 1:15:29.530
I don't want her to
have to stop herself

1:15:30.865 --> 1:15:32.867
when she remembers
who she's talking to.

1:16:25.019 --> 1:16:26.087
How was the gym?

1:16:52.913 --> 1:16:53.914
Can we sit down?

1:16:53.948 --> 1:16:56.083
I don't want to sit down.

1:16:56.117 --> 1:17:01.021
What I want, Peter, is
for you to explain this

1:17:02.857 --> 1:17:04.391
and whatever happened in there.

1:17:04.425 --> 1:17:06.026
That Peter, is what I want.

1:17:07.995 --> 1:17:08.829
Okay

1:17:12.199 --> 1:17:15.669
There's this girl,
a young woman.

1:17:15.703 --> 1:17:16.637
What young woman?

1:17:17.705 --> 1:17:19.006
Julie.

1:17:19.039 --> 1:17:22.743
Julie, do I know her?

1:17:22.776 --> 1:17:23.644
No.

1:17:24.879 --> 1:17:26.413
Well?

1:17:26.447 --> 1:17:28.716
Apparently she
thinks I'm her father.

1:17:29.950 --> 1:17:30.818
And are you?

1:17:34.155 --> 1:17:34.989
No.

1:17:36.790 --> 1:17:38.159
So she's lying then?

1:17:39.994 --> 1:17:44.999
Yes, or she's confused,
or she's mistaken.

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:51.172
Or maybe, just maybe
you really are her father.

1:17:57.077 --> 1:17:58.245
Not feeling too good.

1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:00.347
You know what?

1:18:02.049 --> 1:18:03.083
I am going to sit down.

1:18:03.117 --> 1:18:04.084
What age is she?

1:18:04.118 --> 1:18:05.019
What difference does it make?

1:18:05.052 --> 1:18:05.953
Just tell me her age.

1:18:05.986 --> 1:18:09.924
Don't know, 22, 23, maybe.

1:18:09.957 --> 1:18:11.225
Okay well at least
that's something.

1:18:11.258 --> 1:18:12.960
Jesus Christ, how many
times do I have to say

1:18:12.993 --> 1:18:15.329
I have never cheated on you?

1:18:15.362 --> 1:18:16.197
Never.

1:18:18.032 --> 1:18:19.233
What about her mother?

1:18:21.268 --> 1:18:22.136
Who is she?

1:18:24.138 --> 1:18:25.206
I'm not sure.

1:18:25.239 --> 1:18:26.073
Peter.

1:18:28.142 --> 1:18:29.376
I'm really not sure.

1:18:33.881 --> 1:18:34.715
Look.

1:18:39.820 --> 1:18:40.821
Look.

1:18:43.558 --> 1:18:44.758
Look at you.

1:18:50.464 --> 1:18:52.800
What the fuck is going on?

1:19:23.297 --> 1:19:26.834
You have one new
message, first new message.

1:19:26.867 --> 1:19:30.104
Hi, my mother
told me to call you,

1:19:30.137 --> 1:19:33.307
we got your number from
the sign at the dig site

1:19:33.340 --> 1:19:36.877
but there's this
deer and it's injured

1:19:37.845 --> 1:19:39.847
so my mom said that you
should get over here

1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:42.550
and she's gone to get a vet.

1:19:42.584 --> 1:19:43.817
Okay, bye.

1:20:09.977 --> 1:20:12.514
I would have put
him down, I wanted to.

1:20:23.490 --> 1:20:24.892
Shouldn't we wait for the vet?

1:20:24.925 --> 1:20:27.194
Yeah but, how long
is that gonna take?

1:20:28.162 --> 1:20:31.533
out here, I mean
just look at it.

1:20:31.566 --> 1:20:33.467
Don't you think it
would be cruel to just,

1:20:33.500 --> 1:20:35.336
leave it here like
that in such pain?

1:20:37.104 --> 1:20:39.206
You might wanna
look away for this.

1:20:39.239 --> 1:20:40.908
It's not gonna be
nice, look away!

1:21:33.528 --> 1:21:34.361
Rose.

1:21:37.532 --> 1:21:40.067
You need to get rid
of all of these.

1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:41.502
Is this the place you go?

1:21:41.536 --> 1:21:42.704
Yeah.

1:21:42.737 --> 1:21:43.605
Is there anything else?

1:21:46.340 --> 1:21:49.977
There's some syringes
back in my room to.

1:21:50.010 --> 1:21:51.679
Where in your room?

1:21:51.713 --> 1:21:57.017
In a, it's a box
file in my study desk.

1:21:57.619 --> 1:21:58.452
Anything else?

1:21:58.485 --> 1:21:59.286
No.

1:21:59.319 --> 1:22:00.120
You're sure?

1:22:02.122 --> 1:22:04.191
Actually there's two bottles.

1:22:04.224 --> 1:22:06.594
You have to be really
careful with them.

1:22:06.628 --> 1:22:07.461
Okay.

1:22:24.612 --> 1:22:26.146
You were my first pregnancy

1:22:28.248 --> 1:22:31.952
and I had always wanted a
child more than anything.

1:22:34.722 --> 1:22:37.659
And yet when you were born, I
never actually looked at you.

1:22:40.795 --> 1:22:41.962
Not really.

1:22:46.099 --> 1:22:51.104
Wasn't able to, I
felt empty inside

1:22:55.108 --> 1:22:56.644
like I didn't know who I was.

1:23:02.316 --> 1:23:03.283
Then there you are.

1:23:04.786 --> 1:23:06.487
I never actually held you.

1:23:09.256 --> 1:23:10.625
Can I hold you now?

1:23:26.841 --> 1:23:28.676
I thought I could
never love you.

1:23:29.811 --> 1:23:31.211
That you were his child.

1:23:33.815 --> 1:23:36.818
I felt like I could
never be your mother.

1:23:36.851 --> 1:23:38.018
You are my mother.

1:23:40.788 --> 1:23:41.623
I am.

1:25:00.467 --> 1:25:01.268
Fucker.

1:25:04.672 --> 1:25:05.506
Hello?

1:25:07.207 --> 1:25:07.875
Yes.

1:25:09.711 --> 1:25:10.545
Yeah.

1:25:13.615 --> 1:25:14.448
Yes.

1:25:19.319 --> 1:25:20.153
Yes.

1:25:26.326 --> 1:25:27.160
Okay.

1:25:30.932 --> 1:25:31.799
Yes.

1:27:01.689 --> 1:27:03.958
Do you know why I said
we should meet here?

1:27:04.926 --> 1:27:05.993
I can imagine.

1:27:06.027 --> 1:27:06.961
Really?

1:27:06.994 --> 1:27:08.563
Yeah, I haven't forgotten.

1:27:11.933 --> 1:27:12.934
Okay, that's good.

1:27:16.336 --> 1:27:17.471
But the details.

1:27:18.973 --> 1:27:20.240
Do you remember them?

1:27:22.643 --> 1:27:23.945
I'll refresh your memory.

1:27:24.846 --> 1:27:26.013
There's no need.

1:27:26.047 --> 1:27:27.314
I insist.

1:27:33.453 --> 1:27:35.056
Everyone is packing up to leave

1:27:35.089 --> 1:27:36.991
when you asked me to stay back.

1:27:38.526 --> 1:27:40.995
I recall feeling flattered
so I said I would.

1:27:42.964 --> 1:27:44.364
You said you had
something to show me

1:27:44.397 --> 1:27:46.033
so I followed her
away from the site

1:27:46.067 --> 1:27:47.535
and onto the golf course.

1:27:50.805 --> 1:27:52.305
We went over by a bunker.

1:27:54.909 --> 1:27:55.977
It was very isolated.

1:27:57.945 --> 1:27:59.781
You began with small talk.

1:28:01.582 --> 1:28:06.587
The view, the weather, the
usual and then you changed.

1:28:10.725 --> 1:28:11.526
I could see it.

1:28:14.562 --> 1:28:16.296
And I told you I
was uncomfortable.

1:28:18.833 --> 1:28:21.334
I looked around and I could
see how alone we were.

1:28:25.106 --> 1:28:26.641
And I got frightened.

1:28:30.443 --> 1:28:35.049
Maybe you sensed
that, liked it even.

1:28:42.422 --> 1:28:43.423
And then it started.

1:28:51.464 --> 1:28:52.767
I told you to stop.

1:28:55.736 --> 1:28:56.604
I said no.

1:28:59.140 --> 1:28:59.974
I said no.

1:29:03.443 --> 1:29:08.115
And then you punched
me, hard in the chest.

1:29:10.417 --> 1:29:11.418
I was winded.

1:29:16.724 --> 1:29:21.529
I was terrified.

1:29:21.562 --> 1:29:22.395
Do you remember?

1:29:28.435 --> 1:29:29.837
I need you to respond.

1:29:30.738 --> 1:29:32.139
Yes.

1:29:32.173 --> 1:29:33.440
Yes what?

1:29:36.577 --> 1:29:37.945
I remember you said no.

1:29:39.046 --> 1:29:40.548
But you didn't stop.

1:29:42.550 --> 1:29:43.517
Did you?

1:29:43.551 --> 1:29:44.384
No.

1:29:54.528 --> 1:29:57.098
When it was over
we both walked back

1:29:58.199 --> 1:29:59.499
and I stood under that tree.

1:29:59.533 --> 1:30:00.400
Do you remember?

1:30:01.869 --> 1:30:02.970
Yes, I remember.

1:30:05.706 --> 1:30:07.775
I didn't know what to do.

1:30:07.808 --> 1:30:08.743
Where to look.

1:30:12.079 --> 1:30:14.115
I felt ashamed, somehow.

1:30:15.516 --> 1:30:16.584
Like I smelled bad.

1:30:19.253 --> 1:30:24.058
Whereas you, you,
you seemed relaxed.

1:30:25.492 --> 1:30:26.794
Like nothing had happened.

1:30:28.863 --> 1:30:30.598
This woman asked if I was okay

1:30:33.668 --> 1:30:36.436
and she brushed some grass
and mud from my clothes.

1:30:40.875 --> 1:30:42.510
I don't know, I was lost.

1:30:52.753 --> 1:30:54.522
And I didn't tell
her what happened.

1:30:59.260 --> 1:31:00.493
I said nothing.

1:31:14.709 --> 1:31:19.513
Julie, Julie is
Rose, my daughter.

1:31:26.887 --> 1:31:28.289
if I had known...

1:31:28.322 --> 1:31:30.725
She was your daughter you
wouldn't have tried to rape her.

1:31:33.561 --> 1:31:34.895
I was someones daughter.

1:31:37.631 --> 1:31:42.636
I, inside me is not very nice.

1:31:49.276 --> 1:31:50.077
No.

1:31:53.814 --> 1:31:55.883
No I don't imagine it is.

1:32:22.810 --> 1:32:25.312
Okay stop, stop, please.

1:32:25.346 --> 1:32:27.048
Just stop, please.

1:32:27.081 --> 1:32:29.917
It's okay, it's
okay, just let go.

1:32:37.825 --> 1:32:40.661
I'll keep my hands away,
I'm not gonna touch it.

1:32:45.366 --> 1:32:47.968
I just, I just need a moment.

1:35:34.569 --> 1:35:36.103
I'm sorry.

1:35:36.136 --> 1:35:37.471
No, it's okay.

1:35:39.974 --> 1:35:42.409
I was just dreaming about us.

1:35:48.882 --> 1:35:51.819
I dreamt I was on the sea wall.

1:35:51.852 --> 1:35:54.188
The sun was breaking
through the clouds.

1:35:57.391 --> 1:36:01.862
And I'm waiting, for you.

1:36:43.966 --> 1:36:48.966
