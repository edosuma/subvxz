00:07.374 --> 00:08.141
I am sick!

I don't want you getting
any sicker.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.177
Just go talk to our son
so we can heal.

00:11.244 --> 00:13.279
He's afraid you're gonna
break his heart again.

00:13.346 --> 00:16.216

you owned up to what you did.

BODE:
He broke Riley's heart.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.483
The night of the accident,
the last thing she felt

00:50.550 --> 00:52.585

01:25.652 --> 01:28.588
Before us, before Riley.

01:28.655 --> 01:31.691

Hell yeah.

All right, listen up.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.677

The bark beetle.

We're exterminators now?

MANNY:
California's in a multi-year
mega-drought, which means

02:33.720 --> 02:36.923
heat-stressed trees
can't defend themselves

02:36.990 --> 02:40.260
against these little critters.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.196
Nasty.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.365
Dead trees are just matchsticks
just waiting to be lit up.

02:45.431 --> 02:48.635
So we work in pairs to remove
the infested limbs.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.604

the other one swamps.

eagle became my best inmate.

And they say we don't
rehabilitate folks here.

03:04.551 --> 03:07.687
Fire Camp's like a vacation
compared to practicing law.

03:07.754 --> 03:10.423
Instead of arguing
with egomaniacs all day,

03:10.490 --> 03:12.825
I get exercise, fresh air.

03:16.963 --> 03:17.830
Hey.

03:17.897 --> 03:20.800
You've been quiet
since your folks visited.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.836
Your mom left brownies so it
couldn't have been that bad.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.973
Yeah, Mom's not
the problem.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.708
Dads are tough.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.944
Mine's impossible.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.513
He acts like Fire Camp
is an embarrassment.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.548
Fire Camp's
our second chance.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.517
He only sees the guy
I used to be,

03:37.584 --> 03:40.353
when I'm in here trying
to be better, you know?

03:40.420 --> 03:41.821

something you didn't do?

04:22.362 --> 04:24.430
So either you fired
the probie whose job this is,

04:24.497 --> 04:25.898
or you're still pissed.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.402
Well...

04:29.469 --> 04:31.604
he did break
our daughter's heart

04:31.671 --> 04:33.973
while we were treating him like
our own son and...

04:34.040 --> 04:35.508
we didn't even know
they were dating.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.744
He had years to tell us,
and he, and he didn't.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.012
So I don't know.

04:39.078 --> 04:42.281
Yeah, that doesn't
burn you up at all?

04:42.915 --> 04:45.451
I'm just glad she got
to have that kind of love.

04:46.719 --> 04:49.322
Even if it ended badly.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.558
And I do love him
like one of our own.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.894
Mistakes and all.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.665
Yeah, well, you're more

04:58.731 --> 05:00.366
Yeah.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.641
'Cause I'm totally ready
for that road trip.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.977
It's a clinical trial.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.013
Phase three, new
medication, I qualify.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.651
Yeah, but you're
doing good right now.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.920
Yes, that's why I qualify.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.822
This trial is
at the forefront of slowing

05:22.889 --> 05:25.324
chronic kidney disease.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.360
Okay, um...

05:27.427 --> 05:29.495
how many patients
are they taking?

05:29.562 --> 05:30.863
500.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.066
I'm so hopeful!

05:33.132 --> 05:36.035
I mean, Bode's here and
I'm gonna get into this trial

05:36.102 --> 05:39.338
and I'm gonna live to take
this road trip with you.

05:43.976 --> 05:46.846
Why don't we just skip
to the road trip now?

05:46.913 --> 05:50.416
You haven't finished
your sweeping.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.751
Here you go.

Eve?

05:53.519 --> 05:56.355
Wait!
Hey, Aydan.

05:58.624 --> 06:01.994
I got to unload
1000 pesto crostinis.

06:02.061 --> 06:03.896
They're totally edible,
they're just imperfect,

06:03.963 --> 06:05.531
so it won't do
for a wedding.

06:05.598 --> 06:06.666
Aw, I love a wedding.

06:06.733 --> 06:07.867
(laughs)

06:07.934 --> 06:09.969
Now you probably think
I'm fishing

06:10.036 --> 06:11.771
to be your plus-one
or something.

06:11.838 --> 06:12.939
Oh, I'm the caterer.

06:13.005 --> 06:14.674
I don't even get a plus-one.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.776
You're probably wishing
you were back in San Francisco.

06:16.843 --> 06:19.045
Big city. Lots of people.
Less chance

06:19.112 --> 06:21.848
of continually bumping
into a certain awkward woman.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.417
Um, nah.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.986
I was ready to leave.
I got divorced.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.922
Oh, I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

06:29.989 --> 06:31.924
It's okay.
I married my best friend.

06:31.991 --> 06:34.761
But it turns out that's
all she was, so...

06:34.827 --> 06:36.629
I came here to start fresh...

06:36.696 --> 06:38.998
And not to pour my heart out
to the nice firefighter

06:39.065 --> 06:41.000
who ordered coffee
and not my life story.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.435
It's an interesting story.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.504
And now I'm late
to go cater

06:44.570 --> 06:46.439
somebody else's
happily ever after.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.074
Uh...
For you.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.744
Thank you for the food.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.546
Mm-hmm.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.852
I heard Engine 8 has
"my baby, my baby"

06:59.919 --> 07:01.988
and 1560 had
"glove and screw."

07:02.054 --> 07:03.623
What language are you speaking?

07:03.689 --> 07:05.024
Cal Fire.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.126
"Glove and screw"
means we sort our screws

07:07.193 --> 07:09.462
while wearing our gloves,
and "my baby, my baby..."

07:09.529 --> 07:12.098
It's a distraction
exercise,

07:12.165 --> 07:15.034
meant to see if a hysterical
citizen can pull your focus

07:15.101 --> 07:17.703
from the original task at hand.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.505
Speaking of which...

07:19.572 --> 07:22.175
Steps and positions
on the line, recruits.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.781
So you made it through week one
of training without quitting.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.617
Now you have the attention
of a division chief.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.155
Eve tells me
you're a real bookworm

07:36.222 --> 07:38.224
when it comes
to Cal Fire manuals.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.159
That's nice.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.595
I'm here to see you
in action.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.096
Pushups, now.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.033

You should eat now

Bless. I've been
on a liquid diet

08:12.825 --> 08:14.493
Well, compliment taken.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.729
They want us to take
some photos on the sky bridge.
Mm.

08:16.796 --> 08:19.832
Something about your dress
in the atrium light, which...

08:19.899 --> 08:21.267
It's a really good dress.

And funny.

08:38.851 --> 08:39.919
Did you call me to tell me that?

08:39.986 --> 08:41.754
No. Uh,

08:41.821 --> 08:45.725
I wanted to apologize
for being so awkward around you.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.694

bumping into each other,

08:53.633 --> 08:57.036
there aren't that many
queer folks here,

08:57.103 --> 08:59.972

21:26.385 --> 21:28.387
(clears throat)

21:30.789 --> 21:32.724
How you liking Cal Fire?

21:32.791 --> 21:34.660
Training, week two.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.495
One minute, I'm trying knots,
and the next,

21:36.561 --> 21:38.030
your mom's taking me
on a ride-along.

21:38.096 --> 21:40.532
She must really like you.
Doesn't feel like it.

21:40.599 --> 21:42.067
Cal Fire means
a lot to my family.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.569
That's why she goes hard
on recruits. Tough love.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.772
Still waiting
on the "love" part.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.940
Just be happy you have her
and not my dad, trust me.

21:49.007 --> 21:50.609
Hang in there.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.577
Thanks.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.680
This really seems
like a lot of blood.

21:54.746 --> 21:58.583
I'm-I'm feeling dizzy.
Hey.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.319
Who cried first?
Bride or the groom?

22:01.386 --> 22:02.821
Wha-What?

22:02.888 --> 22:04.690
Oh, you know, uh,

22:04.756 --> 22:07.359
during the vows--
who cried first?

22:07.426 --> 22:08.694
(stammers)

22:08.760 --> 22:09.928
I-I didn't see the vows.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.697
I'm in the... the wedding band.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.999
I-I play bass.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.901
So...

22:15.967 --> 22:18.570
what kind of music
does your band really play?

22:18.637 --> 22:20.806
Alt... alt country.

22:20.872 --> 22:26.378
Our, uh...
our side hustle is top for...

22:26.445 --> 22:28.046
Is...
Right here.

22:28.113 --> 22:32.718
Our side hustle is to-top 40
covers at weddings.

22:33.552 --> 22:36.054
Wish I had bailed
on this one today.

22:36.121 --> 22:39.091
What's the status
on that med bag?

22:42.127 --> 22:44.830
Thank you. All right. Here.
Lean on me. Lean on me.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.632
All right, let's get you
over here where it's safe

22:47.699 --> 22:49.634
so I can take a look
at your leg.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.370
(groans softly)

22:53.672 --> 22:55.674
(cries quietly)

22:55.741 --> 22:57.709
Have you seen my husband?

22:57.776 --> 22:59.778
He was holding my hand,

22:59.845 --> 23:02.714
and then we fell,
and I lost him.

23:02.781 --> 23:05.517
I haven't. I'm sorry,
but I have some good news.

23:05.584 --> 23:08.754
I don't think your ankle
is broken, just a bad sprain.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.957
We're out of bandages,
so I'm gonna use your veil

23:12.023 --> 23:14.693
to wrap your ankle.
Is that okay?

23:16.161 --> 23:17.729
(crying)

23:21.666 --> 23:25.804
This is supposed to be
the happiest day of my life.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.473
Where is he?!

23:29.274 --> 23:32.511
I can't...
I can't feel my fingers.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.715
Should we move the beam
without the med bag?

23:36.782 --> 23:38.984
Think we're gonna have to.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.787
I got your med bag.

23:41.853 --> 23:43.155
All right.

23:43.221 --> 23:45.791
Let's get that tourniquet on.
Let's go!

23:45.857 --> 23:47.592
All right.

23:47.659 --> 23:49.795
I can't leave.

23:49.861 --> 23:51.630
What if Kai's not okay?

23:51.696 --> 23:54.432
What if he's still in there,
trapped under all of that?

23:54.499 --> 23:56.201
What if he's gone?

23:56.268 --> 23:58.804
It's really scary living
in the unknown, but, ma'am,

23:58.870 --> 24:00.872
as soon I get you out
to the triage tent,

24:00.939 --> 24:02.674
I can come back in
and look for him.

24:02.741 --> 24:05.010
No, no, no.
It's my wedding!

24:05.076 --> 24:07.445
I can't leave without him.

24:07.512 --> 24:10.015
Okay, what if he's hurt?
Or what if...?
Hey, hey.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.783
I know exactly how you feel.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.852
Your wedding caterer
is my friend.

24:13.919 --> 24:15.620
And I haven't found her, either.

24:15.687 --> 24:16.755
Aydan?
Yeah.

24:16.822 --> 24:18.924
She's amazing.
She is.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.926
Tourniquet's secure.

24:20.992 --> 24:23.795
All right, Nash. We got you.
Take a deep breath.

24:23.862 --> 24:27.532
Ready? On my count. Three.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.501
But we have to be brave
together, you and I.

24:29.568 --> 24:30.602
I got you.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.504
Two.

24:32.571 --> 24:35.507
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop!

24:35.574 --> 24:36.908
One.
(groaning)

24:36.975 --> 24:38.643
Take him to triage.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.245
Stop! That's unstable.
(shrieks)

24:40.312 --> 24:42.180
All right, we're clear.
No one else here.

24:42.247 --> 24:43.849
(rumbling)

24:43.915 --> 24:45.584
Chief, do you hear that?

24:46.718 --> 24:49.888
Look out!
(others yelling)

24:52.791 --> 24:56.761
(coughing)

24:56.828 --> 24:59.197
Chief? You out there?

24:59.264 --> 25:01.066
Chief?!

25:07.939 --> 25:10.876
Chief? (coughs)

25:10.942 --> 25:13.245
Vince?! (panting)

25:15.046 --> 25:17.249
VINCE:
Jake? You can you hear me?
I'm in one piece.

25:17.315 --> 25:20.252
(coughing)

25:20.318 --> 25:25.090
Yeah. Yeah. Keep talking. I'm...
I'm following your voice.

25:25.156 --> 25:26.124
I got lucky, sort of.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.927
All that rubble we moved away
from the bass player

25:28.994 --> 25:30.729
created a small void hole.

25:30.795 --> 25:32.264
I'm in it.

25:32.330 --> 25:35.600
But I would very much
like to get out.
Okay.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.068
(sighs)

25:37.135 --> 25:40.305
All right, yeah.
I see you.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.140
Hang tight.

25:43.842 --> 25:45.677
(grunts)

25:45.744 --> 25:50.215
(loud grunting)

25:50.282 --> 25:51.950
(coughs)

25:52.017 --> 25:55.253
(panting)

25:55.320 --> 25:57.756
Eve, please tell me you're free.

25:57.822 --> 26:01.126
EVE: Negative. I'm trying
to access the 15 people trapped

26:01.192 --> 26:02.794
under debris in the bravo side.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.129
All right.

26:04.195 --> 26:06.731
(grunts)
That's good.

26:06.798 --> 26:08.700
(indistinct radio chatter)

26:12.704 --> 26:15.607
Hey, Rebecca, I'm Bode.

26:15.674 --> 26:17.676
Uh, you know, I'm sorry.
I know we're super busy.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.311
I just didn't want to miss
the chance to talk to you.

26:19.377 --> 26:21.947
Oh, yeah? Is it
this very fashionable jumpsuit

26:22.013 --> 26:23.648
that caught your eye or...?

26:23.715 --> 26:25.583
Who's wearing it best?

26:25.650 --> 26:27.018
Me, obviously.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.920
I won't argue with a lawyer.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.356
You know what I do?

26:31.423 --> 26:33.124
Yeah, that's, um...

26:33.191 --> 26:34.859
that's actually what I want
to talk to you about.

26:34.926 --> 26:38.997
Look, my, uh, my boy Freddy--
he was falsely accused, and,

26:39.064 --> 26:40.632
well, now he's in here,
and even his own...

26:40.699 --> 26:42.600
his own dad won't come
visit him, and so I was

26:42.667 --> 26:44.602
wondering if maybe you could
look... look at his case?

26:44.669 --> 26:46.371
(laughs)
You know, I got inmates
banging down my door

26:46.438 --> 26:49.107
for legal advice.
(siren approaching)

26:49.174 --> 26:52.811
You're asking for your friend,
not for you?

26:52.877 --> 26:55.680
Yeah. I mean, Freddy's the one
who took a bad plea deal.

26:58.216 --> 27:01.119
Yeah, uh, I'll take a look
at his case.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.789
Thank you.

27:04.856 --> 27:06.024
I'll see you around?

27:06.091 --> 27:08.126
I hope so.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.229
Manny, that crane
is seven minutes out.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.832
How much longer till we have
the space to set it up?

27:13.898 --> 27:16.234
About 20 minutes, Chief.

27:16.301 --> 27:19.137
We have 15 trapped people
whose lives depend on that.

27:19.204 --> 27:20.705
We'll pick up the pace.

27:20.772 --> 27:22.240
JAKE:
D.C. Leone, the last piece

27:22.307 --> 27:23.908
of sky bridge that just fell--

27:23.975 --> 27:25.377
it crashed onto the sublevel.

27:25.443 --> 27:27.245
Chief's under it.
He's also trapped now.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.147
Vince? What's his status?

27:29.214 --> 27:32.150
No, he's okay. He's fine.
I'm here with him.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.152
My dad's trapped.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.754
Your mom's Superwoman.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.188
She'll figure it out, right?

27:37.255 --> 27:38.857
JAKE:
All right, look,
you give me that crane,

27:38.923 --> 27:40.725
I'll get him out of here.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.395
The one crane has
to do double the duty now.

27:43.461 --> 27:45.964
What if it's not fast enough?
Then...

27:46.031 --> 27:48.133
Hey, you know
what Dad would say.

27:48.199 --> 27:50.135
"Work, don't worry." Right?

27:50.201 --> 27:52.737
Yeah. Yeah.

27:52.804 --> 27:54.672
Okay. Thank you.

27:57.208 --> 27:59.277
Hey, I heard one
of the firefighters say

27:59.344 --> 28:01.413
the hotel has a broken
forklift in the delivery area.

28:01.479 --> 28:02.914
Yeah?

28:02.981 --> 28:04.716
You used to hot-wire cars,
right?

28:04.783 --> 28:06.284
Think you can fix it?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.820
Maybe with an assist.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.889
Let's go.

28:10.955 --> 28:12.857
(grunting)

28:12.924 --> 28:15.994
Come on. Damn it!

28:16.061 --> 28:17.228
(groans)

28:17.295 --> 28:18.897
Chief, I can't get
a purchase point.

28:18.963 --> 28:19.998
Jake, stop!

28:20.065 --> 28:22.033
It's too heavy, and you know it.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.768
Hurting yourself's
not gonna help.

28:23.835 --> 28:26.104
I'm sorry. I...

28:26.171 --> 28:29.407
I am... trying. I'm...

28:29.474 --> 28:32.744
Just calm down
and wait for the crane.

28:32.811 --> 28:35.313
A little concrete is no match
for my wife.

28:35.380 --> 28:39.217
We've both seen that woman
move mountains. (groans)

28:39.284 --> 28:41.486
(water rushing)

28:44.522 --> 28:46.825
Uh, Jake?

28:48.026 --> 28:49.461
We got another problem.

28:49.527 --> 28:51.463
Try to start it up.
See what happens.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.501
(engine starting)

28:56.568 --> 28:57.869
All right.

28:57.936 --> 29:00.338
It starts, but I can't
put it in gear.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.340
You open this thing up
and see what's going on?

29:05.276 --> 29:08.079
"Work, don't worry."
I like that, man.

29:08.146 --> 29:10.048
(chuckles)
It drove me crazy as a kid.

29:10.115 --> 29:12.350
I'd be worrying about some
massive test I had coming up,

29:12.417 --> 29:14.352
and I just wanted
to whine about it,

29:14.419 --> 29:16.354
but my dad was always right.

29:16.421 --> 29:19.257
Annoyingly, it helps.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.159
Well, that's one thing
you guys both agree on.

29:21.226 --> 29:22.494
And now here you are making room

29:22.560 --> 29:24.829
for the crane
that's gonna save his life.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.231
I don't want to see him,

29:26.297 --> 29:27.832
but I don't want him
to die in some hole, either.

29:27.899 --> 29:30.435
Yeah, I got you.

29:31.069 --> 29:32.804
This cotter pin's missing.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.806
The damn thing's not gonna shift
without the cotter pin.

29:34.873 --> 29:37.308
Hey, what about the prong
in your belt buckle?

29:40.111 --> 29:42.447
That just might work.

29:44.249 --> 29:46.451
Let's see.

29:49.254 --> 29:52.190
Yeah, baby. Yeah!

29:52.257 --> 29:53.925
All right, hold on.

29:54.592 --> 29:57.529
We got it
from here, Chief.

30:00.331 --> 30:02.567
Chief Dillon,
the crane is landing.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.569
We're going to punch the boom
through the glass

30:04.636 --> 30:08.206
and drop it inside to you.
Stand by!

30:08.273 --> 30:10.175
DILLON:
Which segment do we move first?

30:10.241 --> 30:13.444
The one with 15 trapped,
or Chief Leone?

30:13.511 --> 30:14.546
Say again.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.581
Which segment do we move first?

30:16.648 --> 30:20.418
The one with 15 trapped,
or Chief Leone?

30:20.485 --> 30:22.921
It's your call, Chief.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.861
The 15 first.

30:29.928 --> 30:32.330
They've been trapped longer,
and there's more of them.

30:32.397 --> 30:34.899
I'm sorry, Vince.

30:34.966 --> 30:37.035
Jake, you will get
the crane second.

30:37.101 --> 30:38.369
You do whatever it takes

30:38.436 --> 30:40.572
to keep my husband alive
a little longer.

30:40.638 --> 30:42.507
Copy.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.051
(glass shatters)

30:53.117 --> 30:54.586
Hear that, Chief?

30:54.652 --> 30:59.290
The crane's gonna free the 15,
then it's all ours.

31:00.158 --> 31:02.060
Where's the water at now?

31:02.126 --> 31:04.329
(grunts)

31:04.395 --> 31:07.632
It's at my neck.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.474
God, I'm so, so sorry.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.277
I'm sorry I kept Riley
a secret all those years.

31:19.344 --> 31:21.346
I'm sorry I can't
help you now.

31:21.412 --> 31:24.582
Hey, stop!
Shut up!

31:24.649 --> 31:27.318
Stop talking like you're not
gonna get me out of here,

31:27.385 --> 31:29.087
that you're gonna
let me die in a hole.

31:29.153 --> 31:30.321
It's not happening.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.123
I trained you to be smart,

31:32.190 --> 31:36.427
resourceful, trained you to be
the best. Start acting like it.

31:36.494 --> 31:39.197
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

31:39.264 --> 31:41.099
Work, don't worry, Jake.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.433
You can figure this out.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.902
(sighs)
Work, don't worry.
