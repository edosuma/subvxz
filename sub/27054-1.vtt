welcome to my micasa.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.764
-I'm in kind of a hurry.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.550
-Just for a second.

07:00.594 --> 07:01.595
We talk, no?

07:01.638 --> 07:04.336
-All right, all
right, all right.

07:05.773 --> 07:08.602
-They rent by the week
so I figured how bad

07:08.645 --> 07:10.430
could that be, huh?

07:11.300 --> 07:12.649
-Nice picture, here you go.

07:12.693 --> 07:13.476
-Thanks.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.348
Sit down please.

07:16.392 --> 07:20.396
We'll order up some tacos,
drink some Dos Equis.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.920
-Listen, I gotta go.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.488
-Okay, no tacos,
how about burritos?

07:25.532 --> 07:26.489
-No thanks.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.666
-You know what this for?

07:31.059 --> 07:32.147
-Not really.

07:32.190 --> 07:35.759
-He's paying me
to kill two cops.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.500
You knew that, yes?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.200
You must have known.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.334
-I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.031
Kain said you were old friends

07:47.075 --> 07:49.643
and you needed to
borrow some money.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.079
And if you're involved
in some murder plot

07:51.122 --> 07:53.821
which I have absolutely
no involvement in

07:53.864 --> 07:55.910
or knowledge of, then
you need to go straight

07:55.953 --> 08:00.523
to the police and confess
your crimes young man.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.308
Is there someone in the bedroom?

08:03.352 --> 08:06.964
-No way man, don't go
getting all loco on me, okay?

08:07.008 --> 08:08.531
-Freeze scumbag.

08:11.055 --> 08:11.839
-Ho!

08:14.537 --> 08:15.320
Shit.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.557
Guess what, you're under arrest.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.648
Nice shot partner.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.667
You can't play the bad cop.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.669
-I'm playing the bad cop.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.237
-You know what happened
last time you played

09:02.280 --> 09:03.455
the bad cop?

09:03.499 --> 09:04.674
-Yeah, it wasn't my
fault, I didn't know

09:04.718 --> 09:05.806
it was a plastic bat.

09:05.849 --> 09:06.981
-That's my point.

09:07.024 --> 09:09.592
It's not the kind of
guy you can scare.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.289
-Because I'm a woman?

09:11.333 --> 09:12.813
-I didn't say that.

09:12.856 --> 09:17.469
It's just your not an
intimidating person really.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.689
-You keep this up, and
I'm gonna slap a sexual

09:19.733 --> 09:23.388
discrimination suit on you
and this whole department.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.608
-Okay, we'll try
it your way honey,

09:25.652 --> 09:27.610
but when it doesn't
work, follow my lead

09:27.654 --> 09:28.568
and I'll be the bad cop.

09:28.611 --> 09:29.786
-No.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.702
If it doesn't work,
you follow my lead.

09:47.761 --> 09:51.155
-All right, we know you
work for Kain Lawton.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.114
-Lots of people
work for Kain Lawton.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.638
-Yeah, but we know
you're his courier.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.031
-So?

09:57.074 --> 09:59.207
-Listen jackass, we heard
you say you helped him

09:59.250 --> 10:00.643
set up the hit.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.645
You're an accessory
to commit murder.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.820
-What?

10:03.864 --> 10:06.301
I never said that,
play the recording.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.694
-Recording broke.

10:09.739 --> 10:10.522
-Oops.

10:11.349 --> 10:12.568
-Hey what are you doin'?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.917
What the hell is this?

10:13.961 --> 10:15.005
-So we got an eye witness
and two veteran cops

10:15.049 --> 10:16.659
who heard you setting
up the murder.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.270
- All right, all right.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.532
Hang on a sec.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.753
Let's hear what he has to say.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.669
-Kain said it was
a loan for a friend.

10:26.713 --> 10:27.496
-A loan?

10:27.539 --> 10:28.628
-Yeah, a loan.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.501
-You know what?

10:32.544 --> 10:33.589
I believe you.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.764
-Thank you.

10:34.808 --> 10:35.852
-But a jury won't.

10:35.896 --> 10:36.940
-What?

10:36.984 --> 10:39.116
-Well think about it.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.640
My partner here is
willing to testify

10:40.683 --> 10:43.686
that she heard you
set up the hit.

10:44.818 --> 10:48.604
I think a jury's gonna believe
whatever she has to say.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.258
She's a decorated officer.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.781
Everyone loves her.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.218
-Not everyone.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.006
-Hey buddy, you been in
this career for 20 years.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.834
20 long years.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.923
I think the jury's gonna believe

11:02.966 --> 11:06.361
that you knew exactly
what that money was for.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.711
-But he didn't
tell me anything.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.758
-Well if he told you something,

11:11.801 --> 11:14.064
maybe I can offer you
witness protection.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.370
-What?

11:15.413 --> 11:16.937
Witness protection for
this piece of garbage?

11:16.980 --> 11:21.637
-Think about it man, a condo
on a golf course in Arizona.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.683
$3000 a month, tax free.

11:24.901 --> 11:29.340
Condo's paid for, use that
money to buy food, booze,

11:31.603 --> 11:34.563
those hookers you like so much.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.826
It's a pretty sweet deal man.

11:38.654 --> 11:41.222
What's it gonna be Rob?

11:41.265 --> 11:44.051
You gonna play ball with me,

11:44.094 --> 11:46.967
or gonna be a
stupid little shit?

11:47.010 --> 11:48.533
Huh?

11:48.577 --> 11:50.971
-No, I'm not gonna flip.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.930
-Listen Rob, you
better start wising up.

11:53.974 --> 11:56.585
The alternative is hard
time with a bunkmate

11:56.628 --> 11:59.762
named Bubba who hasn't
seen a woman in 20 years.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.416
You wanna be Bubba's bitch?

12:01.459 --> 12:04.767
-All right, all right, all
right, lemme handle this.

12:04.811 --> 12:05.637
Yes.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.118
-This is crazy.
-Hey hey hey,

12:08.162 --> 12:09.816
it's not fucking crazy
man, it's a fucking deal.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.382
It's the last one you're
gonna fucking get.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.384
So you fucking play ball with me

12:13.428 --> 12:15.604
or that deal's fucking gone.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.171
- I can't
do it, I'm sorry.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.739
-Hold on a second, calm down.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.480
How flexible is
your asshole Rob?

12:22.524 --> 12:25.614
Have you ever been
with two men at once?

12:25.657 --> 12:29.226
I'm not gonna lie to
you, it can hurt a lot.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.664
-So what's it gonna be Rob?

12:32.708 --> 12:34.928
Drinking margaritas
on the back nine,

12:34.971 --> 12:37.452
or do laundry for, I
don't know, say 20 years

12:37.495 --> 12:40.107
for a few thousand
California's finest?

12:40.150 --> 12:42.370
-I need to talk to my lawyer.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.720
-God damn right you do.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.028
Come on let's get
the fuck out of here.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.560
-So what's the deal?

12:58.603 --> 13:00.605
-You got a hearing
in three days.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.694
I'm gonna try and get
your bail extended,

13:02.738 --> 13:05.785
but be prepared to be
taken into custody.

13:05.828 --> 13:09.658
Chin up, everything
is gonna be awesome.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.573
We'll probably get a
settlement out of this

13:11.616 --> 13:13.880
for police brutality.

13:13.923 --> 13:17.405
You watch, you're gonna end
up making a tightly little sum

13:17.448 --> 13:19.189
from all of this.

13:19.233 --> 13:22.671
This just might be the best
day of your entire life.

13:22.714 --> 13:23.715
-I doubt that.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.630
-Hey, positive thoughts.

13:28.633 --> 13:32.986
Kain wants to see you
tomorrow at nine a.m. sharp.

13:33.029 --> 13:33.943
-Okay.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.816
-I'll see you in
court on Monday?

13:36.859 --> 13:38.948
You just wait,
everything is gonna

13:38.992 --> 13:41.211
be super grandtastic baby.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.997
Best day of your life.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.459
-Happy birthday.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.383
What's wrong?

14:27.779 --> 14:28.911
-I didn't get all the details,

14:28.955 --> 14:32.175
but I knew he wasn't
giving him 20 grand

14:32.219 --> 14:34.351
because he liked
the way he looked.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.005
-Fucking Kain.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.702
You've been loyal
to him for 20 years

14:37.746 --> 14:39.617
and this is the
shit he does to you.

14:39.661 --> 14:42.577
-Yeah, and with a slimy
tongued ball licker lawyer

14:42.620 --> 14:45.101
representing me, I'll
get lucky if I don't

14:45.145 --> 14:46.581
get the electric chair.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.542
-Maybe we should take the deal?

14:51.586 --> 14:52.674
-No, I can't.

14:52.717 --> 14:53.718
-Why not?

14:53.762 --> 14:56.983
It would be good for both of us.

14:57.026 --> 14:57.809
-Yeah, but,

14:57.853 --> 14:58.898
-No buts!

14:58.941 --> 15:01.901
We could use a
change of scenery.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.556
I could get a nice part
time job at a pet store

15:05.600 --> 15:07.776
taking care of the animals.

15:07.819 --> 15:12.650
And you could run every day
and do 10k's every weekend.

15:12.694 --> 15:16.263
I'd have time to cook
some actual food.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.656
Baby, we would live
the nice, quiet life

15:18.700 --> 15:21.703
we've always dreamed of.

15:21.746 --> 15:22.834
-Yeah maybe.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.666
- Look.

15:28.710 --> 15:32.932
It's after midnight, you're
officially over the hill.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.065
- Thanks.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.328
-Happy birthday, my love.

15:41.070 --> 15:41.897
Come on.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.378
-What?
-I have a surprise.

15:44.421 --> 15:47.120
-What is it?
-It's a surprise.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.730
But I will give you a hint.

15:48.773 --> 15:49.861
-All right.

15:49.905 --> 15:53.561
-It involves my
mouth, and your penis.

15:53.604 --> 15:54.649
-Mmm.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.434
You're a great wife.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.045
-I have my moments.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.392
Where are you going?

17:27.262 --> 17:32.094
-Kain wanted to see me
first thing this morning.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.965
-What about the deal?

17:35.619 --> 17:37.839
-We've known each
other our whole lives.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.667
He'll take care of me.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.135
-Go on.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.789
-They want you, Kain, bad.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.617
They're gonna keep
pouring sugar on his deal

18:16.660 --> 18:20.621
until he flips, and
eventually he will.

18:20.664 --> 18:23.667
-Thanks Emory,
that's good to know.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.019
-What'd he say?

18:30.457 --> 18:32.676
-I have some
fantastic news for you.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.374
-Really?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.767
-You're not going to jail.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.683
-What about the
hearing on Monday?

18:39.727 --> 18:42.860
-You're not going
to that either.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.514
-What's going on?

18:44.558 --> 18:47.648
-How would you like an
all expense paid trip

18:47.691 --> 18:51.608
to a little country in
the southeast of Asia?

18:52.479 --> 18:54.785
-Okay, but for how long?

18:54.829 --> 18:55.612
-Forever.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.355
I'm gonna give you $500,000.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.841
-I don't know what to say.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.451
-In some of these
small countries,

19:08.495 --> 19:13.064
$500,000 should last you for
the rest of your life, easily.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.024
-Gina always could
stretch a dollar,

19:16.067 --> 19:18.766
but Kain, are you sure?

19:18.809 --> 19:20.637
-It's a win-win.

19:20.681 --> 19:23.727
You get to live in
a tropical paradise,

19:23.771 --> 19:26.774
and I'm secure knowing
the police will never ever

19:26.817 --> 19:28.645
be able to find you.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.519
You've been loyal
to me for decades,

19:32.562 --> 19:33.868
you deserve this.

19:35.391 --> 19:38.220
-Are these cops really
gonna stop looking for us?

19:38.264 --> 19:40.962
-They're not even
interested in you.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.486
They're not even
interested in me.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.533
They're just trying to pinch
me for a couple of bucks.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.056
-Fucking assholes.

19:50.014 --> 19:54.715
-Are you guys in a position
to just pack up and leave?

19:55.759 --> 19:58.632
-Um, hadn't really
thought about it.

19:59.937 --> 20:02.766
But I think we can make it work.

20:03.680 --> 20:07.467
-I'll get you a couple
passports, some tickets,

20:07.510 --> 20:10.252
little seed money
to get you started.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.299
I'll send Scotty over to
your place in a couple hours.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.388
-What about the 500?

20:15.431 --> 20:19.218
-I'll get it to you,
don't you worry about that.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.481
Don't wanna travel
with that kinda money.

20:21.524 --> 20:22.308
Trust me.

20:24.571 --> 20:25.354
-Okay.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.793
-Just one last thing.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.404
-Yeah?

20:31.447 --> 20:33.797
-Don't you ever flip on me.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.538
No matter what happens, no
matter how bad things get,

20:35.582 --> 20:38.628
don't you ever,
never, flip on me.

20:42.763 --> 20:44.243
-You have my word.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.159
If we're living on Kain's dime,

20:48.203 --> 20:49.900
I don't have to be a rat.

20:49.944 --> 20:52.555
-The guy is a murderer.

20:52.599 --> 20:57.256
What makes you think he's
not just gonna kill you too?

20:59.301 --> 21:00.084
Rob?

21:03.349 --> 21:04.480
-I've been with him
since the beginning,

21:04.524 --> 21:07.266
he wouldn't do that to me.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.919
-I don't like it.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.008
-I'll pick you up in a few
minutes, we'll get our stuff,

21:11.052 --> 21:13.794
and get out of here, okay?

21:13.837 --> 21:14.621
-Okay.

21:16.187 --> 21:17.798
-All right, I love you.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.016
-Love you.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.192
Don't forget to get
grandmother's clock.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.368
-I won't forget.

21:22.411 --> 21:26.763
All right, bye.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.539
-Yo, so how we gonna do this?

22:07.761 --> 22:10.546
-I'm gonna knock on the
door, and when he opens it,

22:10.590 --> 22:12.069
I'm gonna punch
him in the throat

22:12.113 --> 22:13.767
and poke him with this.

22:13.810 --> 22:17.553
Then we just wait
for him to pass out.

22:17.597 --> 22:20.774
-Do you think maybe um, you
know, I could do the punch?

22:20.817 --> 22:21.644
-You can forget it.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.603
You just watch and learn.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.126
-Well, can I at least
poke him with the needle?

22:25.169 --> 22:27.694
-I'll let you knock on
the door and that's it.

22:27.737 --> 22:29.304
-All right fine.

22:49.846 --> 22:52.196
- Hey Robby,
Kain sent me over here

22:52.240 --> 22:53.676
to drop off your
birthday present.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.418
Open up man, this bag is heavy.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.563
-You want me to pick it?

23:10.606 --> 23:12.391
-Yeah, pick the lock.

23:49.558 --> 23:51.473
Guns are the last resort.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.606
Kain wants it to
look like he fled,

23:53.649 --> 23:55.477
not like he was murdered.

23:55.521 --> 23:56.609
-Okay, gotcha.

23:59.742 --> 24:04.138
-Blood splatter with a knife
is just the same as a bullet.

24:04.181 --> 24:08.272
If you're gonna stab him,
don't pull out the knife.

24:08.316 --> 24:09.535
-I gotcha.

24:09.578 --> 24:10.753
-Up the stairs.

25:19.605 --> 25:20.693
- Okay,

25:22.825 --> 25:23.609
okay.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.762
-His bag is still
sitting on his bed.

25:47.763 --> 25:51.811
-Yeah, look like he
stepped out for a minute.

25:53.073 --> 25:57.077
Nah, he's not gone, all
his stuff is still here.

25:58.861 --> 25:59.688
Got it.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.301
He want us to wait for him here.

26:19.229 --> 26:22.232
-That's weird, he
forgot his phone.

26:22.276 --> 26:24.278
-Just means that he's close by

26:24.321 --> 26:26.236
and he'll be back soon.

26:34.157 --> 26:36.203
-So he pays us five
grand a month just to sit

26:36.246 --> 26:38.422
on our asses and do
these little errands.

26:38.466 --> 26:41.295
- He pay me a hell
of a lot more than that.

26:41.338 --> 26:42.644
-Of course.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.254
-You just stay alert.

26:44.298 --> 26:47.606
Things can go
sideways real quick.

26:47.649 --> 26:50.043
-Don't worry about a
motherfucking thing.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.784
I was born to do this shit.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.450
The injection will
just knock him out?

27:06.494 --> 27:08.801
- It'll take a
few minutes, but yeah.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.324
- And then we
just dump him in a hole

27:10.367 --> 27:11.673
in the desert?

27:11.717 --> 27:13.762
- That's the plan.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.291
-I'm hungry, you hungry?

27:22.162 --> 27:24.033
-It's not time to eat.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.514
-What's the big deal if
we eat some of his food?

27:26.557 --> 27:31.258
He's gonna be dead in a few
minutes, he's not gonna care.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.826
You like Indian?

28:17.870 --> 28:19.654
-Holy shit!

28:19.698 --> 28:21.525
-What, it's not that bad.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.571
-Hands up, both of you.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.358
Tie his hands.

28:28.402 --> 28:29.620
Tie his hands!

28:34.800 --> 28:35.670
-Hey Rob, how's it going?

28:35.714 --> 28:36.976
-Good.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.760
-Coming over tonight to
watch the Dodger game?

28:38.804 --> 28:40.414
- Uh yeah sure.

28:40.457 --> 28:42.416
-Don't just tell me yes
and then not show up,

28:42.459 --> 28:43.678
I mean, I either gotta cook

28:43.722 --> 28:46.159
an extra Dodger dog or I don't.

28:47.160 --> 28:50.729
-Grab my knife and
cut these things off.

28:55.777 --> 28:56.778
-Everything okay?

28:56.822 --> 28:58.693
You seem kinda jumpy.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.667
-Rob, where are you?

29:16.711 --> 29:18.757
I'm just gonna walk home.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.722
- What
the hell am I gonna do

29:27.766 --> 29:30.681
with him if this thing
does knock him out?

29:39.473 --> 29:42.084
-Hey Rob, what
are you doing here?

29:42.128 --> 29:43.607
Oh know you didn't.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.698
It's been a while since I've
choked someone to death.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.530
In all the years we've
known each other,

29:53.574 --> 29:55.445
did you think I'd be the one?

29:55.489 --> 29:56.229
Did ya?

30:46.845 --> 30:48.368
Think, think, think.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.326
Where can I take him?

30:50.370 --> 30:51.632
Yeah.

30:51.675 --> 30:53.634
Aunt Margaret's house.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.766
It'll be empty for weeks.

31:17.788 --> 31:19.312
-Can I help you?

31:19.355 --> 31:22.924
-LAPD, we have a warrant to
search this entire complex.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.534
-Oh, okay, yeah.

31:25.884 --> 31:26.754
Come on in.

31:41.638 --> 31:44.250
-Well, well, what
do we have here.

31:44.293 --> 31:45.599
-Looks like a full kilo.

31:45.642 --> 31:46.687
-Yep.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.472
-Excuse me.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.648
Can you come in
here for a second?

31:51.692 --> 31:52.475
-Okay.

31:58.307 --> 32:01.702
-So, you know anything
about the drugs we found

32:01.745 --> 32:03.095
on Mr. Lawton's desk?

32:03.138 --> 32:03.965
-What?

32:04.009 --> 32:05.967
No, he hates drugs.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.490
-Where is he?

32:07.534 --> 32:08.578
-Really, I don't know.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.232
He missed his 12
o'clock appointment.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.756
He never misses an appointment.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.382
-What are you doing?

32:29.425 --> 32:31.297
-Don't worry about it.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.344
-Where are we?

32:35.388 --> 32:39.479
-You promised me $500,000 and
you're gonna give it to me.

32:39.522 --> 32:42.134
-Sure Rob, whatever you say.

32:42.177 --> 32:44.179
Why don't we take a nice
little walk down the street

32:44.223 --> 32:45.006
to the bank?

32:45.050 --> 32:46.529
-Why?

32:46.573 --> 32:48.270
Why couldn't you just give
me the money and let me go?

32:48.314 --> 32:49.184
-What are you talking about?

32:49.228 --> 32:50.969
That's exactly what I was doing.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.274
-Bullshit.

32:52.318 --> 32:53.580
I heard Scotty say that
you told him to drug me

32:53.623 --> 32:57.105
and drag me out to the
desert and kill me.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.802
-Scotty's an idiot.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.065
-Yeah he is.

33:00.108 --> 33:03.416
But he's also loyal
and he follows orders.

33:06.636 --> 33:09.683
-Wanna consider your
options carefully.

33:09.726 --> 33:12.381
You gotta chance to
get out of this alive.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.775
But if you keep doing
what you're doing,

33:14.818 --> 33:16.690
you're gonna end up dead.

33:36.623 --> 33:37.624
- Kain?

33:37.667 --> 33:38.799
-No it's me.

33:39.756 --> 33:40.975
-Yo, it's him?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.542
-Got him right here.

33:42.585 --> 33:44.413
I want the $500,000 he promised,

33:44.457 --> 33:45.371
and I want it today.

33:45.414 --> 33:46.981
-Don't give him a penny.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.200
- I'm gonna kill him.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.679
- He ain't
gonna kill shit.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.899
Grab his wife, make a trade.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.167
-What are you doing?

33:59.211 --> 34:00.603
-Whatever the fuck I want.

34:00.647 --> 34:01.735
-You're gonna call 'em back.

34:01.778 --> 34:04.433
-I ain't gonna call nobody.

34:04.477 --> 34:06.566
In about 15 minutes,
my men are gonna

34:06.609 --> 34:08.742
be gang raping your wife.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.248
-Where are you?

34:47.998 --> 34:49.174
- Yeah?

34:49.217 --> 34:51.089
-Listen, I'm gonna
kill your boss

34:51.132 --> 34:52.699
if you don't bring me the money.

34:52.742 --> 34:55.397
-Look I'm sorry buddy,
but we don't work for you.

34:55.440 --> 34:59.575
We work for Kain and he
told us not to pay you.

34:59.619 --> 35:03.492
-Listen dipshit, we
not gonna pay you a dime

35:03.536 --> 35:08.193
till Kain tell us to.

35:21.771 --> 35:24.426
-How long did he
know this guy for?

35:24.470 --> 35:25.819
-I don't know.

35:25.862 --> 35:28.169
Since they were kids.

35:28.213 --> 35:29.518
-That don't seem a
little harsh to rub

35:29.562 --> 35:31.433
out a childhood friend?

35:31.477 --> 35:33.348
-No, he's fucking rat.

35:35.002 --> 35:37.352
-I heard he refused to talk.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.789
-That's bullshit, he's a rat.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.663
-That don't make
you a little nervous?

35:43.706 --> 35:45.230
I mean where does it end for us?

35:45.273 --> 35:49.321
Maybe one day he decides
to have us rubbed out too.

35:49.364 --> 35:53.238
-Just don't be a rat
and you'll be fine, okay?

35:55.805 --> 35:56.589
Shhh.

36:11.473 --> 36:12.779
- Hey Gina.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.694
-Oh, hey Tristan.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.478
-I saw Rob a little while ago,

36:16.522 --> 36:17.566
he was acting kinda weird.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.699
-Yeah, we got a lot going on.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.005
-I'm gonna grab
her from behind,

36:22.049 --> 36:24.704
I'm gonna cover her mouth.

36:24.747 --> 36:27.010
I want you to hogtie
the shit out of her.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.708
- I invited him
over to watch the Dodger game,

36:28.751 --> 36:30.884
but he kinda blew me off.

36:30.927 --> 36:32.712
- Well, sorry,
he's really busy.

36:32.755 --> 36:33.800
-You can come.

36:33.843 --> 36:36.585
-Oh, um, I'm kind of busy too.

36:37.673 --> 36:39.022
-Yeah, that's what he said.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.546
I wasn't sure if he was
telling me the truth,

36:40.589 --> 36:43.157
or if he was just jealous
of our friendship.

36:46.595 --> 36:47.901
-Hold on a second.

36:47.944 --> 36:50.773
-That's rude, we're
having a conversation.

36:50.817 --> 36:51.600
-Hello?

36:51.644 --> 36:53.646
-Gina, thank god, listen.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.213
-What's going on?

36:55.256 --> 36:57.127
-Don't go back to the house.

36:57.171 --> 36:59.478
He's sending his two
goons to kidnap you.

36:59.521 --> 37:00.522
-What?

37:00.566 --> 37:01.697
-Don't go anywhere
near the house.

37:01.741 --> 37:02.655
-Too late!

37:04.744 --> 37:05.788
-Shit!

37:08.878 --> 37:09.662
-Gina!

37:11.794 --> 37:13.013
Who the hell are you?

37:13.056 --> 37:14.580
-Mind your own business, bud.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.190
- This is
my business bitch,

37:16.234 --> 37:17.670
I live next door.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.732
-They almost fucking had me.

37:36.776 --> 37:39.257
-Go to a hotel, pay cash.

37:39.300 --> 37:40.606
Don't tell anyone
where you're staying.

37:40.649 --> 37:41.737
-Like hell I am.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.696
I am going to the
god damn police

37:43.739 --> 37:46.525
and telling them what's
going on and you are too.

37:46.568 --> 37:47.656
-No no no listen.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.744
He's gonna give me the money.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.311
-Like hell he is.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.487
-Just, just give me
a little more time.

37:52.531 --> 37:55.925
-We're both going
to end up dead.

37:55.969 --> 37:59.407
-No we're not,
please, go to a hotel.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.670
I'll call you later.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.759
Gina?

38:03.803 --> 38:04.586
Gina?

38:16.206 --> 38:17.469
You're calling Scotty
and telling him

38:17.512 --> 38:18.731
to bring us the money.

38:18.774 --> 38:20.559
-Nope, not gonna happen.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.822
- Yes, it is.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.824
-More than a dozen men
have pointed a loaded weapon

38:24.867 --> 38:28.567
at me, some of 'em
even took shots.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.743
But not a single
one is still alive.

38:30.786 --> 38:32.745
Put down the gun now.

38:35.225 --> 38:38.577
Rob, you got a pinky dick and
the balls the size of peas.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.056
-Shut up.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.494
-You're not gonna shoot me.

38:44.757 --> 38:49.675
Untie me, put down the gun
before you make me really angry.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.678
-You're making the call.

38:52.721 --> 38:55.115
-Get that gun out of my face.

38:56.421 --> 39:00.425
Now you've done it you
little piece of shit.

39:00.468 --> 39:01.600
Untie me now.

39:02.557 --> 39:05.343
Now, now, now,
now, now, now, now.

39:08.607 --> 39:09.912
Untie me now.

39:09.956 --> 39:12.698
Now, now, now, untie me now.

39:14.917 --> 39:15.788
Now, now, now!

39:15.831 --> 39:17.746
Don't step out of this garage!

39:17.790 --> 39:19.357
Get back in here.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.446
I will not be treated
like an animal!

39:21.489 --> 39:23.448
Get back in here
and untie me now!

39:27.016 --> 39:28.278
- Seven vehicle

39:28.322 --> 39:30.019
returns at 72 and Dearborn
and go to to door,

39:30.063 --> 39:33.675
one five
suspects inside one for 211

39:33.719 --> 39:37.070
suspects armed southbound
Harvard Freeway,

39:37.113 --> 39:38.724
1507 new location.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.253
-Who is he?

39:46.296 --> 39:47.385
-Who knows?

39:47.428 --> 39:48.864
But you know who lives here?

39:48.908 --> 39:49.648
-Who?

39:49.691 --> 39:51.214
-Rob Carobrese.

39:51.258 --> 39:52.041
-Rob?

39:53.652 --> 39:55.784
Isn't that just one
hell of a coincidence?

39:55.828 --> 39:58.308
-We need to get
him in here ASAP.

39:58.352 --> 39:59.353
-Yes we do.

40:00.267 --> 40:01.050
-Officer.

40:02.661 --> 40:04.097
- Yes.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.881
-I want a list of every
relative within a hundred miles

40:05.925 --> 40:08.623
of here, brother,
sisters, grandmothers,

40:08.667 --> 40:10.625
aunts, uncles, everyone.

40:10.669 --> 40:11.713
-Got it.

41:00.414 --> 41:01.720
-Hey Rob.

41:01.763 --> 41:03.678
Are you starting to get hungry?

41:03.722 --> 41:04.984
I'm starving.

41:05.027 --> 41:08.030
Do you think we
could order a pizza?

41:10.250 --> 41:13.558
You know what Rob, I've
been doing a lot of thinking

41:13.601 --> 41:18.040
and I give in, you win.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.610
-Really?

41:22.654 --> 41:23.481
-Yeah.

41:24.612 --> 41:27.702
I hate losing but,
this is so stupid.

41:27.746 --> 41:29.138
You're eventually
gonna wear me down

41:29.182 --> 41:31.663
and get what you want
anyway, so might as well get

41:31.706 --> 41:34.709
this whole thing
over and done with.

41:39.758 --> 41:43.501
-You make the call
and I'll feed ya.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.677
-Nah, I've gotta eat first.

41:49.594 --> 41:50.943
The banks are closed now.

41:50.986 --> 41:53.380
You're gonna have to wait
till the morning anyway.

41:53.423 --> 41:55.425
So we might as well eat.

42:01.649 --> 42:03.303
-Yeah, all right.

42:04.391 --> 42:07.612
-Oh, don't forget, extra
pepperoni and sausage.

42:07.655 --> 42:10.310
You can't have too much meat.

42:16.795 --> 42:17.578
-Awesome.

42:19.711 --> 42:21.277
Keep the change.

42:21.321 --> 42:22.452
Pizza's here.

42:25.325 --> 42:27.980
-Aww yeah.
-Like being served.

42:28.023 --> 42:29.590
-Nice.

42:29.634 --> 42:31.461
I am fucking starving.

42:33.812 --> 42:35.553
What the fuck is this?

42:35.596 --> 42:37.250
Priscilla's Pizza?

42:37.293 --> 42:38.033
-So?

42:38.077 --> 42:39.513
-Mother fucker.

42:41.123 --> 42:43.735
You're un-fucking-believable.

42:43.778 --> 42:44.605
-What?

42:44.649 --> 42:46.085
-How long have you known me?

42:46.128 --> 42:48.696
When have you ever seen me
eat one motherfucking bite

42:48.740 --> 42:50.655
of Priscilla's Pizza?

42:51.873 --> 42:54.136
Get that fucking
shit out of here.

42:54.180 --> 42:55.660
-Oh come on, it's not that bad.

42:55.703 --> 42:57.270
-Like fuck it ain't!

42:57.313 --> 42:59.707
That shit's an abomination.

42:59.751 --> 43:02.667
That's a waste of
flour and sauce.

43:02.710 --> 43:05.757
Get that fucking
shit out of here.

43:09.195 --> 43:10.631
I'm getting you what you want.

43:10.675 --> 43:13.068
The least you can do is show
me some fucking respect.

43:13.112 --> 43:14.853
Get me some premium pizza.

43:35.830 --> 43:38.616
-I had to bribe Pieworks
guy a hundred fucking dollars

43:38.659 --> 43:40.966
to drive this thing out here.

43:41.009 --> 43:42.620
-Aww, what a shame.

43:43.838 --> 43:47.146
I'll tell you what
I'll do, I'll add $100

43:47.189 --> 43:51.672
to the 500,000 fucking
dollars I'm about to give you.

43:53.369 --> 43:54.153
-Shut up.

43:56.808 --> 43:57.635
-Mmm.

44:00.289 --> 44:01.073
Mm mmm.

44:05.686 --> 44:08.820
That is the best pizza
I've ever tasted.

44:11.910 --> 44:15.653
Pieworks sure knows how
to make a good pizza.

44:18.612 --> 44:23.182
Totally worth the extra effort
paying for premium pizza.

44:23.225 --> 44:25.575
That's why you never
made it in this business.

44:25.619 --> 44:28.448
Missed too many of
the small details.

44:28.491 --> 44:30.232
-I never made it because
you kept promising

44:30.276 --> 44:32.452
to promote me and you never did.

44:32.495 --> 44:35.760
-No, you never made
it because of you.

44:35.803 --> 44:38.763
In this business you
get what you take.

44:38.806 --> 44:40.982
You didn't take anything,
so you got nothing.

44:41.026 --> 44:42.157
-That's not true.

44:42.201 --> 44:45.900
You kept telling me
to hang in there.

44:45.944 --> 44:48.903
-Do you want the god's
honest unfiltered truth?

44:48.947 --> 44:50.600
-No, I don't think I do.

44:50.644 --> 44:53.429
-Fuck, I'm gonna
give it to you anyway.

44:53.473 --> 44:57.869
See in this business,
takes a certain skillset.

44:57.912 --> 45:01.568
Either born with
it or you learn it.

45:01.611 --> 45:03.135
But who the fuck cares?

45:03.178 --> 45:04.832
The fact is, you don't have it,

45:04.876 --> 45:06.660
and you're never gonna make it.

45:06.704 --> 45:07.792
-And you don't think--

45:07.835 --> 45:09.837
-Fuck no, you're
just a fucking courier

45:09.881 --> 45:11.752
and that's all
you're ever gonna be.

45:11.796 --> 45:13.145
-That's not true.

45:14.059 --> 45:16.714
-Do you remember Jimmy Nunsy?

45:16.757 --> 45:20.282
-Yeah, I remember Jimmy Nunsy.

45:20.326 --> 45:22.589
-I killed him when I was 17.

45:22.632 --> 45:23.677
-You did?

45:25.113 --> 45:27.855
-I just came over from
England, didn't know anyone,

45:27.899 --> 45:31.554
no friends, there was
Jimmy fucking Nunsy.

45:32.773 --> 45:37.560
Selling weed, popular, hot
fucking cheerleader girlfriend.

45:38.648 --> 45:40.041
I can sell weed.

45:41.695 --> 45:45.307
Why couldn't I be popular and
have a fucking hot girlfriend?

45:45.351 --> 45:47.005
So I slit his throat.

45:47.919 --> 45:50.269
Cut his body up
into small pieces.

45:50.312 --> 45:53.968
Went fishing with
him off Dana Point.

45:54.012 --> 45:56.928
I caught a 50 pound halibut.

45:56.971 --> 45:59.713
That night I slept like a baby.

46:01.280 --> 46:02.629
It was right then
and there I realized

46:02.672 --> 46:05.806
I had what it takes to
make it in this business.

46:05.850 --> 46:08.461
I could be trusted to
make the hard decisions

46:08.504 --> 46:10.768
and not think twice about it.

46:12.030 --> 46:14.380
-You're wrong about me.

46:14.423 --> 46:15.555
-No I'm not.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.820
Don't you think that if I
were in your shoes right now,

46:19.864 --> 46:21.430
wouldn't have the money already?

46:21.474 --> 46:22.388
- No.

46:24.259 --> 46:27.610
-Can't even bring
yourself to hurt me.

46:27.654 --> 46:30.439
-You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

46:30.483 --> 46:32.833
-You don't have what it takes
to make it in this business

46:32.877 --> 46:36.402
and you should have
realized that years ago.

46:36.445 --> 46:37.620
You didn't.

46:37.664 --> 46:38.926
It's not my fault.

46:38.970 --> 46:40.232
That's on you.

46:41.363 --> 46:43.670
You took all of the
stupid jobs I sent you on

46:43.713 --> 46:46.934
as my courier, all
the little errands,

46:46.978 --> 46:49.589
taking all the risk
with no real upside.

46:49.632 --> 46:53.288
That's a sucker bet,
you're the sucker.

46:53.332 --> 46:55.508
-I'm gonna get that money.

46:55.551 --> 46:57.336
Or I'm gonna kill you.

46:58.859 --> 47:00.643
Now make the fucking call.

47:00.687 --> 47:01.819
-I'm not calling anyone.

47:01.862 --> 47:02.645
-But you said!

47:02.689 --> 47:04.125
-So?

47:04.169 --> 47:06.214
The only person I'm
gonna call is your wife

47:06.258 --> 47:09.827
to find out how big
Scotty's dick is.

47:09.870 --> 47:13.700
Now you listen to me you
little fucking bitch.

47:13.743 --> 47:15.528
Eventually I'm gonna
pull this dolly apart

47:15.571 --> 47:18.052
and when I do, you're
gonna be the sorriest

47:18.096 --> 47:19.967
son of a bitch that ever lived.

47:20.011 --> 47:21.795
I promise you that.

47:32.023 --> 47:33.676
- Fucker
thinks he's so smart.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.157
But he couldn't tell the
difference between Pieworks

47:36.201 --> 47:39.508
and the cheap-ass
pizza I made him eat.

47:45.123 --> 47:46.994
Mmmm, fuck that's good.

47:48.213 --> 47:51.216
Pieworks really knows how
to make a premium pizza.

49:43.110 --> 49:45.634
-What the fuck are you doing?

49:45.678 --> 49:47.897
-I'm not gonna let you talk
to me like this anymore.

49:47.941 --> 49:51.031
-I'll talk to you any
way I fucking want.

49:51.075 --> 49:53.642
-Well, I'm not gonna listen.

49:57.516 --> 49:59.561
-All right, that's it.

49:59.605 --> 50:02.608
I'll give you the
money, I'll make a call.

50:02.651 --> 50:05.567
-I gotta prove to you and
myself that I can do this.

50:05.611 --> 50:07.308
-I'll make the call.

50:11.182 --> 50:12.966
I'll make the call!

50:13.010 --> 50:15.099
-I'm gonna torture
you for five minutes.

50:15.142 --> 50:18.015
After that, I'm gonna give you
the chance to make the call.

50:18.058 --> 50:19.407
-I'll make the call.

50:19.451 --> 50:20.713
I'll make the call.

50:20.756 --> 50:23.107
I'll make the call!
I'll make the call!

50:23.150 --> 50:24.586
I'll make the call!
I'll make the call!

50:56.705 --> 51:00.796
-Okay maybe five minutes of
torture was a bit too long.

51:07.803 --> 51:09.370
-Kain.

51:09.414 --> 51:12.199
-Tomorrow morning go to the
bank and get the fucking money.

51:12.243 --> 51:13.679
-$500,000.

51:13.722 --> 51:14.897
-Yes, $500,000.

51:15.898 --> 51:17.465
-Are you sure boss?

51:17.509 --> 51:20.555
Sounds like you're
being coerced.

51:20.599 --> 51:21.991
-Of course I'm getting coerced!

51:22.035 --> 51:24.211
What the fuck
difference does it make?

51:24.255 --> 51:26.648
Go to the bank tomorrow, get
500 fucking thousand dollars,

51:26.692 --> 51:29.608
stop asking stupid
fucking questions, okay?

51:29.651 --> 51:31.914
He's gonna drill ever
square inch of my body.

51:31.958 --> 51:32.741
-Okay.

51:33.655 --> 51:34.874
Where are you?

51:34.917 --> 51:37.529
-Get the money
tomorrow morning, right

51:37.572 --> 51:39.705
and call me, I'll give
you the address then.

51:53.414 --> 51:55.808
-Thanks for patching me up.

51:55.851 --> 51:57.940
-Ah, it's the least I could do.

51:57.984 --> 51:59.507
-Nah, it's cool.

52:00.465 --> 52:03.555
I done some pretty messed up
things to people in the past.

52:03.598 --> 52:06.035
And I never bothered
fixin' 'em up later.

52:06.079 --> 52:08.299
Even after I got what I wanted.

52:08.342 --> 52:09.952
-Hopefully this whole
thing's over tomorrow,

52:09.996 --> 52:12.477
and you can see a doctor.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.740
-Don't worry, it will be.

52:19.701 --> 52:22.051
So have you thought
this through?

52:22.095 --> 52:25.098
I mean, really
thought this through.

52:25.142 --> 52:28.710
Yeah, sure, they're gonna
show up with the cash,

52:28.754 --> 52:32.671
they're not just
gonna give it to you.

52:32.714 --> 52:36.414
If you want it, you're
gonna have to take it.

52:41.723 --> 52:42.724
-Yeah of course.

52:42.768 --> 52:44.639
I got a bulletproof plan.

52:46.206 --> 52:47.773
-I certainly hope so.

53:11.057 --> 53:12.667
-You better start wising up.

53:12.711 --> 53:14.974
The alternative is hard
time with a bunkmate

53:15.017 --> 53:18.020
named Bubba who hasn't
seen a woman in 20 years.

53:19.587 --> 53:21.633
-So what's it gonna be Rob?

53:21.676 --> 53:23.939
Drinking margaritas
on the back nine

53:23.983 --> 53:26.246
or doing laundry for
I would say 20 years

53:26.290 --> 53:30.032
for a few thousand of
California's finest?

53:30.076 --> 53:33.079
-Maybe we should take the deal?

53:33.122 --> 53:35.777
We could use a
change of scenery.

53:35.821 --> 53:38.345
Would be good for both of us.

54:29.309 --> 54:31.268
-All right, you got me.

54:32.356 --> 54:34.009
What the hell you
doing out here?

54:34.053 --> 54:36.664
-I tracked him to
his dead aunt's house.

54:36.708 --> 54:38.710
He seems to be laying low.

54:38.753 --> 54:39.667
-Any sign of Lawton?

54:39.711 --> 54:40.755
-Nope.

55:03.648 --> 55:06.912
- Fuck!

55:31.502 --> 55:33.460
-Gonna move on in
the living room.

55:33.504 --> 55:34.809
-Whatever you say.

55:34.853 --> 55:37.464
Got you mother fucker.

55:37.508 --> 55:38.726
God this reminds me
of the first time

55:38.770 --> 55:40.728
I ever suffocated someone.

55:40.772 --> 55:43.078
It was a grandmother of a girl--

55:44.776 --> 55:46.299
She found out I was married.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.866
She was gonna tell my wife.

55:47.909 --> 55:49.781
What a rotten
thing to do, right?

55:49.824 --> 55:52.523
Come here
you little pussy!

55:52.566 --> 55:53.350
Come here!

55:56.788 --> 55:59.312
You little fucking weasel.

56:17.809 --> 56:21.378
If you let me die,
you'll never get a penny!

56:40.222 --> 56:41.572
-It's his aunt's house.

56:41.615 --> 56:43.225
He's out on bail, so he's
not breaking any laws.

56:43.269 --> 56:44.052
-Got it.

56:45.358 --> 56:46.751
-See this?

56:46.794 --> 56:48.013
That's the one we want.

56:48.056 --> 56:50.015
-We found a kilo of
cocaine in his office.

56:50.058 --> 56:51.538
You don't want that scum
on the street do you?

56:51.582 --> 56:53.366
-No ma'am.

56:53.410 --> 56:56.151
-The trick is if
you can get in there,

56:56.195 --> 56:58.850
you can ID him,
and get a warrant.

56:58.893 --> 57:02.201
Get a warrant, we
can arrest him.

57:02.244 --> 57:02.984
-Aye aye Captain.

57:03.028 --> 57:05.683
-Oh hold on one second.

57:05.726 --> 57:08.381
What's the difference
between being a terrible cop

57:08.425 --> 57:09.556
and a great cop?

57:09.600 --> 57:11.776
-A great cop will
get into that house

57:11.819 --> 57:13.168
no matter what.

57:13.212 --> 57:14.866
-And a terrible cop
is gonna walk back here

57:14.909 --> 57:17.216
with his tail between his legs.

57:17.259 --> 57:19.784
-Lives will be lost if
we don't get this guy

57:19.827 --> 57:20.654
off the street this morning.

57:20.698 --> 57:21.786
-Don't worry.

57:21.829 --> 57:23.614
I did door to door
sales in college.

57:23.657 --> 57:24.832
And I was number
one in my region

57:24.876 --> 57:26.834
for eight consecutive months.

57:26.878 --> 57:29.794
I can talk my way
into any house.

57:29.837 --> 57:31.578
-Go get 'em tiger.

57:38.716 --> 57:41.762
-It's 500 fucking grand, I'm
not just gonna give it to ya.

57:41.806 --> 57:42.633
-Why not?

57:42.676 --> 57:44.417
Don't I deserve it?

57:44.461 --> 57:47.464
-If you can get
it, you deserve it.

57:48.465 --> 57:51.119
You know, I'm glad you
drilled holes in my feet.

57:51.163 --> 57:52.730
Nearly gas me to death.

57:52.773 --> 57:53.731
-Yeah right.

57:53.774 --> 57:55.646
-No I'm serious.

57:55.689 --> 57:56.647
It's moments like this that you

57:56.690 --> 57:59.519
get the most clarity in life.

57:59.563 --> 58:01.652
-Now you're just
fucking with me.

58:01.695 --> 58:03.088
-No, I'm serious.

58:05.482 --> 58:07.527
I know I'm a
borderline sociopath.

58:07.571 --> 58:10.661
-Mmm you're not borderline.

58:10.704 --> 58:14.360
-I am, I took an
online test once.

58:14.403 --> 58:15.666
I was borderline.

58:17.058 --> 58:20.584
I lack conscience,
I have no empathy.

58:20.627 --> 58:24.588
I don't have a narcicisstic
personality disorder.

58:24.631 --> 58:27.286
A full blown sociopath
is very impulsive

58:27.329 --> 58:30.594
and does not consider
the consequences.

58:31.595 --> 58:35.860
I spent my whole life
considering consequences.

58:35.903 --> 58:38.558
-I stand corrected.

58:38.602 --> 58:42.040
-I don't feel guilty for
the things that I've done.

58:42.083 --> 58:45.565
I don't feel guilty
for not feeling guilty.

58:45.609 --> 58:50.439
I wonder if I'd applied
myself to a legitimate career

58:50.483 --> 58:52.267
how far I coulda gone.

58:53.268 --> 58:55.749
Maybe it's not too late for me.

58:57.708 --> 58:58.578
-It's not.

58:59.927 --> 59:01.799
It's not too late for any of us.

59:01.842 --> 59:03.278
-For you maybe.

59:07.195 --> 59:09.110
-You can do what you want,

59:09.154 --> 59:12.505
but if I get this money,
I'm gonna slip away

59:12.549 --> 59:17.075
to a third world country
and I'm gonna do it right.

59:17.118 --> 59:18.598
-Well part of me
hopes that you do.

59:19.947 --> 59:22.559
-Yeah, it's the other
part I'm worried about.

59:22.602 --> 59:24.169
-I'm serious.

59:24.212 --> 59:26.606
It's a romantic idea.

59:26.650 --> 59:30.610
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
make it easy for ya.

59:30.654 --> 59:32.351
But I hope ya get it.

59:33.570 --> 59:34.353
-Thanks.

59:52.371 --> 59:55.069
-Hey there partner,
name's Jim Hasslup.

59:55.113 --> 59:56.636
I'm a local realtor.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.072
Can I come in for a second?

59:58.116 --> 01:00:00.814
-Uh, no, I'm kinda in
the middle of something.

01:00:00.858 --> 01:00:02.511
-Listen, I've got
this nice young couple

01:00:02.555 --> 01:00:04.383
that really loves the
neighborhood and they think

01:00:04.426 --> 01:00:07.647
that this house could be
the perfect fit for them.

01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:08.735
-That's great.

01:00:08.779 --> 01:00:09.649
- Yeah, I
think they're gonna

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:10.824
make an offer this afternoon.

01:00:10.868 --> 01:00:11.956
-I'll make sure I
let the family know.

01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:15.481
-But I need to take a
few pictures for them.

01:00:15.524 --> 01:00:16.917
-Sorry, this place is a mess.

01:00:16.961 --> 01:00:19.659
They're repainting
and everything is

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:20.878
-They're not gonna care.

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:23.141
They just wanna get a
feel for the layout.

01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:24.621
-Can you come back
this afternoon?

01:00:24.664 --> 01:00:27.449
-No, I'm running an open
house the other side of town.

01:00:27.493 --> 01:00:29.930
Gonna be tied up all afternoon.

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:31.018
-What about tomorrow?

01:00:31.062 --> 01:00:33.673
- Not in
this market, fella.

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:36.328
Look, I don't wanna let a
buyer sit on this over night.

01:00:36.371 --> 01:00:37.677
They're ready to make a deal.

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:39.636
We'll be in escrow by tomorrow.

01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:43.901
Come on, come on, it's
only gonna take a second.

01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:46.294
What? You got a
dead body in there?

01:00:46.338 --> 01:00:48.340
-Listen man, I
can't let you in.

01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:49.907
It's really not my call.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:51.648
I'm just the cousin, ya know?

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:53.867
Trying to clean
the place up a bit.

01:00:53.911 --> 01:00:56.783
Call Michael, that's her
son, maybe he can let you in.

01:00:56.827 --> 01:00:57.697
-Okay I'd love to.

01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.481
I'll call him right now.

01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:00.613
What's his number?

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.834
-Uh, I lost my
phone so I don't have

01:01:03.877 --> 01:01:05.879
his number on me, sorry.

01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:31.644
-That's it?

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:32.906
That's it?

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:35.474
That's your fucking best
number one sales guy

01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:37.041
for six straight months effort?

01:01:37.084 --> 01:01:38.216
-It was eight months.

01:01:38.259 --> 01:01:40.131
-That was a pretty
weak effort officer.

01:01:40.174 --> 01:01:41.828
You might wanna reconsider
your career choice.

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:43.917
-He shut the door in my face.

01:01:43.961 --> 01:01:45.571
What was I supposed to do?

01:01:45.614 --> 01:01:49.706
-If Lawton's in there,
we're gonna need his help.

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.359
-All right.

01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:53.753
All right, look, let's
call his attorney

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:56.060
and we sweeten the deal.

01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:59.063
-Yeah, we'll offer
him 80 grand a year

01:01:59.106 --> 01:02:01.152
and a full three bedroom house.

01:02:01.195 --> 01:02:03.632
-Are you guys
authorized to do that?

01:02:03.676 --> 01:02:05.765
-Well, the question is not
whether we're authorized,

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.899
the question is is he
dumb enough to believe it?

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:10.552
-The whole witness
protection program

01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:13.164
is only quasi-legal anyway.

01:02:13.207 --> 01:02:15.427
-And before he
realizes what happened,

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:17.385
he'll be living in a shitty
one bedroom apartment

01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:20.649
for the rest of his life,
already having testified.

01:02:20.693 --> 01:02:23.261
-We'll apologize and say
it was a clerical error.

01:02:23.304 --> 01:02:25.306
-And a very very bad
man will be serving

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.830
three to four life sentences.

01:02:26.873 --> 01:02:28.440
-And you can do that?

01:02:28.483 --> 01:02:30.094
-Do you want the
criminals to win?

01:02:30.137 --> 01:02:32.096
-No, of course not.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:34.228
-Ya got a lot to learn
about law enforcement son.

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:38.755
-I'm sorry, I just didn't
know that's how it worked.

01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:45.065
-Hey Robert, did they call yet?

01:02:48.025 --> 01:02:48.808
-Not yet.

01:02:53.073 --> 01:02:55.946
-Well, I hope
you're ready to die.

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:58.296
-I am, thanks.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.822
-Good, 'cause that's
exactly what's gonna happen.

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:03.823
-We'll see.

01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:08.219
-I'm not kidding.

01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:11.526
These guys are fucking animals.

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:12.789
I don't mean to be a dick,

01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:14.399
but if you wanna live,
you should probably

01:03:14.442 --> 01:03:16.227
get the fuck out of here.

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:17.750
-And do what?

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:21.928
Go back to my apartment and
wait for you to kill me?

01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:26.411
-Yeah, probably wouldn't
go back to your apartment.

01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:32.417
-I got no other options.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:35.550
This is my one chance
and I'm gonna take it.

01:03:35.594 --> 01:03:36.943
It might not work.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.207
Then again it might.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.429
-You're not thinking clearly.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.519
I'm just trying to help you out.

01:03:47.562 --> 01:03:49.651
Don't say I didn't
try and warn you.

01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:51.044
-Believe I won't.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.573
-Help me to the bathroom,
I need to go take a leak.

01:03:58.617 --> 01:03:59.923
-You can wait.

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:02.664
-Like fuck it can.

01:04:03.665 --> 01:04:05.276
Help me to the bathroom now,

01:04:05.319 --> 01:04:07.669
I need to take a piss!

01:04:28.299 --> 01:04:28.995
-What are you doing here?

01:04:29.039 --> 01:04:30.867
-Nice to see you too.

01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:33.565
-Sorry, but it
could be dangerous.

01:04:33.608 --> 01:04:36.002
-No shit, that's why
I'm here to get you.

01:04:36.046 --> 01:04:37.656
-Look, it's almost
over, they're bringing

01:04:37.699 --> 01:04:38.962
the money this morning.

01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:41.965
-Your lawyer just called me.

01:04:42.008 --> 01:04:43.096
-All right, close your eyes.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.315
-What?

01:04:44.358 --> 01:04:45.316
-Just close your eyes
and don't open 'em

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:46.665
until I tell ya, okay?

01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:47.579
-Okay.

01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:48.623
-All right.

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:57.458
-Jesus Rob!

01:04:57.502 --> 01:04:58.764
What the hell are you thinking?

01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:01.375
-I told you to keep
your eyes closed.

01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:02.811
-Hey Gina.

01:05:02.855 --> 01:05:03.725
-Hey Kain.

01:05:10.645 --> 01:05:12.778
-What'd the lawyer want.

01:05:12.821 --> 01:05:15.694
-He said they're
sweetening the deal.

01:05:15.737 --> 01:05:17.826
They're gonna give
us $80,000 a year

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:22.614
and a full stand alone house,
not some cheap-ass condo.

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:24.703
-Are you sure?

01:05:24.746 --> 01:05:26.183
-Yes.

01:05:26.226 --> 01:05:27.793
And we won't be fugitives
and we won't have to worry

01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:30.361
about Kain trying to find us.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:33.451
-Believe me if I flip on Kain,

01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:34.756
we'll have to worry about him.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.236
-He'll be in jail.

01:05:39.848 --> 01:05:40.632
-Really?

01:05:40.675 --> 01:05:42.808
$80,000 a year?

01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:43.983
-That's what he said.

01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:45.419
-Come on, babe.

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:52.078
I can't do it.

01:05:52.122 --> 01:05:53.558
Gina, I'm sorry.

01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:58.171
-You've got to get
over this macho honor

01:05:58.215 --> 01:05:59.956
amongst thieves bullshit.

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:01.653
-When I went to work
for Kain that was the one

01:06:01.696 --> 01:06:05.004
thing he made me
promise, I wouldn't flip.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:06.745
-He tried to kill you.

01:06:06.788 --> 01:06:08.616
-And I knew he might.

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:11.184
That's part of the deal.

01:06:11.228 --> 01:06:12.707
And not I'm trying to
pinch him for the money.

01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:15.797
-It doesn't have
to be this way.

01:06:15.841 --> 01:06:18.148
-He's a lot of awful things.

01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:20.498
But he won't go to the police
and tell them I kidnapped him

01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:22.108
and try to have me arrested.

01:06:22.152 --> 01:06:26.504
He'll handle it himself,
and that's what I'm doing.

01:06:32.379 --> 01:06:34.686
You're asking me to do
the one thing I can't do.

01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:36.993
It might not be right, it
might be totally stupid.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.037
-It is.

01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:40.170
-But I'm just not gonna do it.

01:06:40.213 --> 01:06:42.041
Where would I be if I
threw away the one rule

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:43.042
that I have?

01:06:48.395 --> 01:06:49.440
-Shit Rob.

01:06:49.483 --> 01:06:50.223
-Trust me.

01:06:50.267 --> 01:06:52.269
-Just be careful, okay?

01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:27.739
-I haven't pissed my
pants since first grade,

01:07:27.782 --> 01:07:32.396
just get me a fucking bottle
and I'll piss right here.

01:07:33.788 --> 01:07:36.487
-You need to shut the hell up.

01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:42.667
-You did not just slap me.

01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:45.713
Oh now you fucked up.

01:07:45.757 --> 01:07:48.934
Now you done it, that's
it, you fucked up!

01:08:24.448 --> 01:08:27.625
-We're gonna go in
with a bag full of paper

01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:30.367
and if everything
checks out, we come back

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:31.716
and get the money.

01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:32.542
Got it?

01:08:33.761 --> 01:08:34.587
-Got it.

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:38.636
Are we going to give it to him?

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:42.205
-It's Kain's money,
so it's Kain's call.

01:08:43.728 --> 01:08:45.947
We work for him, remember?

01:08:47.732 --> 01:08:49.212
-Yeah, I remember.

01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:02.399
-You got the money?

01:09:02.442 --> 01:09:04.314
-Yeah, I got the money.

01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:06.620
Tell us where you are.

01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:11.799
-I've been thinking.

01:09:12.756 --> 01:09:15.846
I'm not sure this
is the life for me.

01:09:16.848 --> 01:09:19.590
-What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:09:19.633 --> 01:09:22.723
-The sneaking around,
the guns, the killing.

01:09:22.767 --> 01:09:24.725
And the knives.

01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:26.640
Fuck me Scotty, I didn't know
we were gonna be involved

01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:28.816
in some hand to hand combat.

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:30.514
-What did you think?

01:09:30.557 --> 01:09:32.993
We were selling
Girl Scout cookies?

01:09:33.037 --> 01:09:35.562
-I haven't slept a
wink since we started.

01:09:35.606 --> 01:09:37.999
-Oh fuck me, are you serious?

01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:39.523
-Yes.

01:09:39.566 --> 01:09:40.698
This shit is not for me.

01:09:40.741 --> 01:09:43.439
I was not cut out for this.

01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:47.661
-All right fine, but you're
gonna have to tell Kain.

01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:49.533
-I know.

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:52.057
-He's gonna go ape shit on you.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:53.754
He might not let you quit.

01:09:53.798 --> 01:09:55.408
You know that right?

01:09:55.452 --> 01:09:56.757
-Yeah, I know.

01:09:58.629 --> 01:09:59.673
-Shit.

01:10:01.066 --> 01:10:03.764
Now I'm gonna have to find
somebody else to train.

01:10:03.808 --> 01:10:07.203
Thanks for being a big
fat unshaven pussy.

01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:11.772
-I'm sorry.

01:10:14.297 --> 01:10:17.474
-This is gonna set my
promotion back at least

01:10:17.517 --> 01:10:19.606
another couple months.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.608
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:10:51.638 --> 01:10:54.902
You better get your shit
together and man the fuck up.

01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:55.816
You understand?

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.078
-Yeah, of course.

01:10:57.122 --> 01:11:00.604
-And if I get so much
as a scratch on me,

01:11:00.647 --> 01:11:04.085
I will pound your ass
into the pavement.

01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:07.393
You got it?

01:11:07.437 --> 01:11:08.351
-I got it.

01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:47.041
-Put your guns
in the flower pot.

01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:49.479
- Sure, no problem.

01:11:58.662 --> 01:12:00.968
-What the hell is going on now?

01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:04.668
-I don't know, maybe
they're paying him off?

01:12:08.019 --> 01:12:10.021
Ready to redeem yourself?

01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:11.152
-I guess so.

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:14.895
-Lemme see the money.

01:12:14.939 --> 01:12:16.506
-Sure, have a look.

01:12:16.549 --> 01:12:18.769
-Throw the bag over here.

01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:31.825
Hey, what are you
trying to pull?

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:35.612
-We got company.

01:12:37.048 --> 01:12:39.398
-Any chance I could
get those pictures now?

01:12:39.442 --> 01:12:40.573
-Oh shit.

01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:41.444
-Who the fuck is that?

01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:42.749
- Shhh.

01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:44.795
It's the realtor, just
be quiet, he'll go away.

01:12:44.838 --> 01:12:46.710
- I can hear you.

01:12:46.753 --> 01:12:47.928
-We need to get in there.

01:12:47.972 --> 01:12:49.277
-Jesus Christ.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.676
-I'm not going away
until you let me in

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.635
and let me get some pictures.

01:12:58.678 --> 01:13:01.289
-That's not no fucking realtor.

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:04.554
-Oh hey there big guy.

01:13:09.559 --> 01:13:10.821
-Darren, cut me loose!

01:13:13.867 --> 01:13:14.651
Come on!

01:13:23.573 --> 01:13:24.704
Hold 'em off.

01:13:26.271 --> 01:13:27.141
Did you hear me?

01:13:27.185 --> 01:13:28.708
Get your shooter, hold them off.

01:13:28.752 --> 01:13:29.796
-Okay.

01:14:32.685 --> 01:14:34.600
-Get out of there now.

01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:49.572
-Take a long good look.

01:14:49.615 --> 01:14:52.313
This is gonna be you next.

01:14:59.756 --> 01:15:01.497
That was fun.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:04.848
Not as much fun as I'm
going to have killing you.

01:15:04.891 --> 01:15:05.675
Kneel.

01:15:10.114 --> 01:15:12.508
How would you like to die?

01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:14.684
Maybe I'll kick your head in.

01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:17.861
Slice an artery,
watch you bleed out.

01:15:18.818 --> 01:15:21.342
Maybe I'll twist your
stupid fucking head off

01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:22.822
with my bare hands.

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:27.261
You shoulda let
me take that piss.

01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:29.481
'Cause no matter how I kill you,

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.701
first thing I'm gonna do,

01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:35.618
take a long hard piss all
over your fucking body.

01:15:38.359 --> 01:15:41.362
Let's start off
with a nice gunshot.

01:15:48.979 --> 01:15:52.722
Doesn't matter, we'll
just do this old school.

01:15:52.765 --> 01:15:55.594
Nice strangulation's
going to be in order.

01:16:18.138 --> 01:16:18.922
Well?

01:16:19.966 --> 01:16:21.533
Don't be a pussy.

01:16:22.882 --> 01:16:27.800
Don't fuck this up, you'll
never get this chance again.

01:16:27.844 --> 01:16:28.627
Do it!

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.765
-You're right.

01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:39.595
I wasn't meant for this.

01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:42.728
I don't have it in me.

01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:44.643
-So what are you gonna do?

01:16:44.687 --> 01:16:46.645
Take the plea bargain?

01:16:46.689 --> 01:16:47.777
Turn me in?

01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:51.911
-No.

01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:55.001
I'm not a rat.

01:16:56.742 --> 01:16:58.788
-So what are you gonna do?

01:17:00.703 --> 01:17:02.008
-I don't know.

01:17:05.316 --> 01:17:07.666
-You're cagey as fuck.

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.233
Loyal to a fault.

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.671
Should have promoted you.

01:17:12.715 --> 01:17:14.368
-It's a little late.

01:17:18.808 --> 01:17:19.635
-Hey,

01:17:20.723 --> 01:17:22.681
don't forget your money.

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:25.989
You deserve it.

01:17:27.468 --> 01:17:29.645
-It was newspaper.

01:17:29.688 --> 01:17:33.649
-You never carry cash
to a hot situation.

01:17:33.692 --> 01:17:37.391
You always keep it by,
in case you need it.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:40.786
Check the trunk.
