00:05.005 --> 00:07.275
( theme music playing )

00:11.945 --> 00:14.115
( scratching )

00:22.456 --> 00:26.260
LET ME, UH--
LET ME GIVE YOU
A LITTLE TIP, OKAY?

00:26.360 --> 00:29.530
- MM-HMM.
- FOR TRAVELING--
A LITTLE TRAVELING TIP.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.433
TRY NOT
TO WEAR SHORTS.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.336
IT'S NOT ALL THAT ATTRACTIVE
TO LOOK AT FOR FIVE HOURS.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.305
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
- HONESTLY. NO, I'M NOT.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.672
- I WEAR THESE ON EVERY
FLIGHT WHEN I TRAVEL...
- REALLY?

00:38.772 --> 00:40.374
- ...'CAUSE IT'S
VERY COMFORTABLE.
- YES. YEAH.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.510
THESE PLANES,
IF YOU NOTICE,
GET VERY HOT.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.446
- AH. YES, THEY DO.
- I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T SEE
WHERE I HAD TO CHECK

00:45.546 --> 00:47.548
WITH THE PERSON
I'M SITTING NEXT TO
WHAT I SHOULD WEAR.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.917
I'M COMFORTABLE
IN PAJAMAS, BUT I DON'T
WEAR PAJAMAS ON A PLANE.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.885
I LIKE TO SING.
I LIKE TO WHISTLE.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.454
I LIKE TO PLAY
THE BONGOS ON MY LEG.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.123
- I LIKE
TO IMITATE HORSES...
- OKAY.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.024
- ...BUT I DON'T DO IT, OKAY?
- ALL RIGHT.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.059
- BECAUSE THERE'S SOMEBODY
SITTING NEXT TO ME.
- YEAH, OKAY. OKAY.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.662
WOW, YOU'RE VERY
UPTIGHT, DUDE.
VERY UPTIGHT.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.831
- UPTIGHT? I DON'T
THINK IT'S "UPTIGHT."
- IT'S JUST SHORTS, MAN.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.534
- YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN A MAN'S LEGS?
- YEAH, THEY'RE GROTESQUE.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.736
WHAT IF THEY WERE
A WOMAN'S IN A SKIRT?

01:08.836 --> 01:11.505
WOULD YOU SAY THAT
TO HER IF A WOMAN'S
IN A SKIRT?

01:11.605 --> 01:14.142
- IF THEY WERE HAIRY.
- OKAY.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.577
ARE YOU READY
FOR A HOT TOWEL?

01:18.646 --> 01:20.581
( yelling )

01:23.484 --> 01:25.819
SHE MUST'VE PUT IT
IN THE MICROWAVE.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.357
DON'T YOU THINK? I MEAN,
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS IS YOUR LIFE?

01:29.457 --> 01:31.492
- HUH.
- ONLY ME. ONLY ME
THIS HAPPENS TO.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.061
I BET YOU
I COULD SUE 'EM.
DON'T YOU THINK?

01:34.162 --> 01:35.896
DO I HAVE A CASE?
TELL ME.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.132
- WOULD YOU
TESTIFY FOR ME?
- NO.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.800
- YOU WOULDN'T TESTIFY?
- NO, I WOULDN'T.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.469
I FIND THAT ODD
AND TROUBLING.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.205
YEAH, IT WOULD BE HARD
TO FIND A DOCTOR WHO,
IN GOOD CONSCIENCE,

01:44.305 --> 01:47.841
COULD RECOMMEND
A HIGH-VALUE SETTLEMENT
FOR THAT BURN.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.444
OKAY.
I'LL DROP IT.

01:50.544 --> 01:53.080
- FORGET ABOUT IT.
- OKAY. BY THE WAY,

01:53.181 --> 01:55.115
I AM LOVING THE MUSIC
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.951
- OH.
- THE OPERA?
FABULOUS.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.553
I'M GLAD
YOU LIKE IT.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.922
I GOT THE IDEA
FROM AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT--

02:02.022 --> 02:03.957
A NEW ITALIAN RESTAURANT
CALLED MATTEO'S.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.760
THEY HAVE LIVE SINGERS
WHO DO SOME ARIAS

02:06.860 --> 02:08.696
- FROM VARIOUS ITALIAN OPERAS.
- NO KIDDING?

02:08.796 --> 02:10.831
- YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH.
- WHAT A FABULOUS IDEA.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.800
I NEED TO BUY
AN ANNIVERSARY GIFT
FOR MY FRIENDS.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.135
I'LL BET YOU-- THAT WOULD BE
A GOOD GIFT, WOULD IT NOT?

02:15.236 --> 02:17.271
- IT'D BE A GREAT GIFT.
- A GIFT CERTIFICATE
TO THIS RESTAURANT?

02:17.371 --> 02:19.139
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH. DO IT.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.642
- ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.111
- I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU, YOU KNOW.
- NO PROBLEM.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.580
- WELL, SHOULD I COME BACK?
- NO, YOU DON'T NEED
TO COME BACK.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.783
- IT'LL BE HEALED BEFORE
YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR.
- ( laughs )

02:29.883 --> 02:31.619
OKAY.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.821
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:33.921 --> 02:36.123
I WAS JUST THINKING.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.526
I'D LOVE TO GET
YOUR HOME PHONE NUMBER

02:38.626 --> 02:40.761
JUST IN CASE
OF AN EMERGENCY
OR SOMETHING ELSE

02:40.861 --> 02:42.763
WITH THE HAND. WHO KNOWS?
SOMETHING COMES UP,

02:42.863 --> 02:45.966
- IT'S NICE TO HAVE.
- I DON'T GIVE OUT
MY HOME PHONE NUMBER.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.301
YOU KNOW,
I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT,

02:47.401 --> 02:50.170
BUT I WOULD
FEEL BETTER, YOU KNOW.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.373
IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
MORE SECURE.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.408
NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN.
I'M NEVER GONNA CALL.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.377
YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE
THE ODDS OF SOMETHING
HAPPENING? ZERO.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.412
WELL, IF ANYTHING HAPPENED,
YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL
THE SERVICE

02:58.512 --> 03:01.615
- AND THEY'LL CONTACT ME.
- YEAH, THEN I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE MIDDLEMAN,

03:01.715 --> 03:03.817
SORT OF, AND MAYBE
THE SERVICE ISN'T THERE.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.520
WHY DOES HE HAVE
THE PRIVILEGE OF TALKING
TO YOU AND NOT ME?

03:06.620 --> 03:09.257
- I'M YOUR PATIENT.
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

03:09.357 --> 03:12.059
YOU MAKE THE CALL.
THEY CALL ME,

03:12.159 --> 03:14.127
THEN I RESPOND TO YOU.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.963
IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM!
IT WORKS EVERY TIME!

03:16.063 --> 03:19.300
I LIKE THE IDEA
OF HAVING MY DOCTOR'S
NUMBER IN MY WALLET.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.469
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN YOUR WALLET.

03:21.569 --> 03:24.805
I WANT YOU
IN MY WALLET.

03:24.905 --> 03:28.242
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION
IN YOUR CASE

03:28.342 --> 03:31.445
PURELY IN THE INTEREST
OF GETTING ON WITH MY DAY.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.447
- FANTASTIC.
THANKS SO MUCH.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.449
I DO NOT EXPECT YOU
TO ABUSE IT

03:35.549 --> 03:38.319
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO CALL ME DIRECTLY
AT HOME, ALL RIGHT?

03:38.419 --> 03:39.687
BUT IF IT'LL
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER,

03:39.787 --> 03:42.456
GET THE NUMBER
FROM MY RECEPTIONIST

03:42.556 --> 03:44.057
- ON THE WAY OUT.
- OKAY.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.793
- KEEP IT DRY...
- KEEP IT DRY.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.561
...AND DON'T CALL.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.735
- HELLO.
- Larry: REALLY?

03:54.835 --> 03:56.704
- WOW.
- WOW.

03:56.804 --> 04:00.107
JEEZ. MARY JANE.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.009
- HEY. HI.
- HI. HI.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.278
- HI.
- HOW ARE YOU?

04:04.378 --> 04:06.347
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
- UH, YEAH.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.049
- WELL, YOU LOOK GOOD.
- SO DO YOU.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.452
THANK YOU.
HOW ARE THINGS?

04:11.552 --> 04:13.987
I JUST CAME FROM THE DOCTOR.
I'VE GOT TWO MONTHS TO LIVE.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.456
- IT'S TERRIBLE.
- NOT VERY FUNNY.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.890
YEAH, I'M TRYING TO GET
WOMEN TO TAKE PITY ON ME,

04:16.990 --> 04:18.626
SO THEY'LL SLEEP WITH ME,
YOU KNOW. THAT'S ALL.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.828
SO I JUST TELL
EVERYBODY THAT.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.196
- HMM.
- SO, UM,

04:23.297 --> 04:25.098
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT'S YOUR SOCIAL SITUATION?

04:25.198 --> 04:27.267
- ARE YOU MARRIED?
- GOD NO.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.836
YOU REGRET BREAKING UP
WITH ME THOUGH.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.571
YOU'RE STILL--
YOU'RE STILL HAVING
NIGHTMARES ABOUT THAT?

04:30.671 --> 04:32.306
YOU-- OH, LARRY,
YOU'RE THE SAME!

04:32.406 --> 04:34.542
YOU CAN ADMIT IT--
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.545
WE SHOULD GO OUT.
WE SHOULD GO OUT
AND CATCH UP.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.212
- YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD
BE FANTASTIC.
- YEAH?

04:39.313 --> 04:40.814
- YEAH, LET'S DO THAT.
- WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT?

04:40.914 --> 04:44.685
TONIGHT I'M GOING
TO TED DANSON'S
ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.255
OH, YEAH. YEAH, MY FRIEND
CHRISTIAN SLATER'S
GONNA BE THERE.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.823
- CHRISTIAN SLATER?
- YEAH.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.392
- HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS?
- YEAH, TELL HIM I SAID HI.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.594
UH, NO, BUT I'LL--
I'LL SEE HIM.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.497
- UM, HOW ABOUT TOMORROW?
- OKAY.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.198
- WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A DATE?
- YEAH.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.067
- DO YOU HAVE
MY NUMBER?
- I DO.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.035
- WHAT? DO YOU THINK
I THREW AWAY YOUR NUMBER?
- YOU DO NOT HAVE MY--

05:02.135 --> 05:04.304
I'VE GOT THE NUMBER
OF EVERY WOMAN I'VE EVER
GONE OUT WITH IN MY LIFE.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.074
BELIEVE ME. I'M GONNA
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.677
- YEAH. ( laughs )
- I'VE CHANGED.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.845
- BYE.
- BYE.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.985
( chatting )

05:18.085 --> 05:20.654
MOZZARELLA? YEAH.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.559
- HEY.
- HI.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.095
DO YOU REMEMBER
MARY JANE PORTER?

05:28.195 --> 05:29.797
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.999
- I RAN INTO HER TODAY.
- HOW'S SHE LOOK?

05:32.099 --> 05:33.701
- FANTASTIC.
- REALLY?

05:33.801 --> 05:35.703
- OH MY GOD,
SHE'S A DOLL.
- OH GOD.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.838
- YOU KNOW?
- YEAH. WHY'D SHE
GO OUT WITH YOU?

05:37.938 --> 05:39.840
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE WENT OUT WITH ME.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.809
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.711
- A BIG BOWL
OF OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.
- WAY OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.946
- HUGE TIME.
- WELL, THAT'S WHY
SHE GOT RID OF ME.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.115
- YEAH. REALLY?
- WELL, I WAS SO DESPERATE.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.083
SHE COULD SENSE
THE INSECURITY.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.453
- THEY PICK UP ON IT.
- INSTANTLY.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.422
- I'M SEEING HER
TOMORROW NIGHT.
- REALLY?

05:54.522 --> 05:56.156
YEAH.  SHE ASKED ME.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.358
MAYBE SHE'S GOT
THE DESPERATION THIS TIME.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.127
- HOPEFULLY.
- HOPEFULLY.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.630
IT'S A LOT EASIER
TO WORK WITH THEIR
DESPERATION THAN MINE.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.698
- LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION. SEXUALLY...
- YEAH. YEAH.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.700
...CAN I-- CAN I PICK UP
WHERE I LEFT OFF WITH HER?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.602
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU PUT IN YOUR TIME.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.571
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
15 YEARS LATER, BUT...

06:10.671 --> 06:12.305
EVERYTHING YOU'VE
DONE BEFORE COUNTS.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.074
YES. I DON'T KNOW.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.744
IN TERMS OF UNHOOKING BRAS,
I'M REALLY GONNA
BE IN TROUBLE.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.379
- LOOK AT THIS?
- WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU USE YOUR RIGHT HAND?

06:19.480 --> 06:21.649
I'M-- I'M A LEFTY UNHOOKER.
I CAN'T UNHOOK RIGHTY.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.217
IT'S FROM THE CAR,
I THINK, WHEN YOU PARK.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.386
- RIGHT.
- YOU'RE MAKING OUT
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,

06:26.487 --> 06:28.756
YOU LEAN OVER,
IT'S YOUR LEFT HAND
THAT'S DOING THE UNHOOKING.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.591
RIGHT, YOU GET
USED TO THE LEFT.
IT'S LIKE THE ONE THING

06:30.691 --> 06:32.159
IF YOU'RE A RIGHTY
THAT YOU DO WITH YOUR
LEFT HAND WITH SKILL.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.595
- THAT'S TRUE.
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH CHERYL?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.630
HOPEFULLY WE CAN
CAST HER IN THIS THING

06:36.730 --> 06:38.466
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.768
WHAT ABOUT THE WHOLE
MEG RYAN SITUATION?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.603
OH, IT'S GONNA--
IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT JERRY.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.539
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW, I'VE JUST
GOTTA CONVINCE JERRY

06:45.639 --> 06:48.241
TO USE CHERYL,
'CAUSE IF I CAST HER...

06:48.341 --> 06:50.478
THEN I THINK
I'LL HAVE A SHOT.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.245
- I THINK IT'S A GREAT PLAN.
- IN THE MEANTIME,

06:52.345 --> 06:53.981
I'M ALLOWED TO HAVE
SOME FUN, RIGHT?

06:54.081 --> 06:55.315
PLEASE! WHY NOT?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.284
MARY JANE PORTER
ASKING YOU.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.186
HEY, WHAT DID

06:59.286 --> 07:01.789

07:26.947 --> 07:28.916
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE?
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE GREAT.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.451
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANNA
GIVE THAT MUCH?

07:31.552 --> 07:33.420
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

07:33.521 --> 07:34.855
WHAT? WHY ARE

07:34.955 --> 07:36.456

07:41.161 --> 07:43.564
- AND IT WAS EXPENSIVE TOO.
- THIS IS GREAT. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE EVEN BROUGHT THAT UP.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.365
- I'M SORRY.
THIS IS GREAT.
- NO, IT'S REALLY NICE.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.768

07:53.541 --> 07:55.375
- NO.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.344

08:10.658 --> 08:13.293
EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK
TO THE HOSTS OF COURSE.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.629
I UNDERSTAND.
"OH, I'M THE HOST.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.398
HELLO, I'M THE HOST
OF THE PARTY."

08:18.498 --> 08:20.634
- HEY.
- HEY, L.D.
HOW ARE YOU, MAN?

08:20.734 --> 08:23.436
GOOD. YOU KNOW,
I RAN INTO A FRIEND
OF YOURS TODAY.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.338
- WHO'S THAT?
- MARY-- MARY JANE PORTER.

08:25.438 --> 08:28.676
- MMM! I LOVE HER.
SHE'S GREAT.
- MMM.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.779
( chuckles )
JESUS CHRIST.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.381
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE REALLY GOING
TO TOWN ON THAT CAVIAR.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.483
IT'S THE BEST CAVIAR
THEY COULD POSSIBLY GET.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.652
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M
GONNA DO, PASS THIS UP?

08:38.752 --> 08:41.689
I KNOW, BUT I THINK
YOU'RE GOING OVER YOUR
ALLOTMENT A LITTLE BIT. NO?

08:41.789 --> 08:43.456
- MY ALLOTMENT?
- YOU KNOW,

08:43.557 --> 08:45.593
WE'RE EACH ENTITLED
TO TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT

08:45.693 --> 08:48.662
SO EVERYBODY ELSE CAN HAVE
A LITTLE BIT TOO.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.264
- UMM.
- IT FEELS LIKE
YOU'RE GOING OVER.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.733
JUST AN OBSERVATION.
NOT A BIG DEAL.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.635
- OKAY.
- JUST SOMETHING
I'M OBSERVING.

08:54.735 --> 08:58.071
WELL, IT'S GOOD THAT
YOU'RE HERE TO PATROL
THE HOR D'OEUVRES AREA.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.607
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.109
WE HAVE UNWRITTEN LAWS
IN THIS SOCIETY.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.178
IF I'M TALKING
TO SOMEBODY AND THEY SAID
THEIR FRIEND HAS CANCER,

09:05.278 --> 09:07.480
I GO "OH. OH. OH."

09:07.581 --> 09:09.883
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW
THE PERSON, I GO "OH."

09:09.983 --> 09:11.284
YOU KNOW,
IT'S AN UNWRITTEN LAW.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.920
YOU DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.922
- MMM. OKAY.
- IT'S A NICE THING TO DO.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.124
WHAT YOU SHOULD
BE DOING HERE IS
YOU TAKE A LITTLE BIT,

09:17.224 --> 09:20.293
THEN YOU STEP AWAY
FOR 20 MINUTES, SEE WHAT
KIND OF ACTION THERE IS.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.862
- OH.
- IF NOBODY'S TAKING ANY,

09:21.962 --> 09:24.097
MAYBE TAKE
A LITTLE BIT MORE,
STEP AWAY AGAIN.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.399
- SO FORTH AND SO ON.
- OKAY, LOOK.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.336
LET ME JUST SCOOP
A LITTLE MORE ON HERE

09:29.436 --> 09:32.673
AND I'M GONNA
STEP AWAY THEN.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.808
- WOW.
- ENJOY THE PARTY.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.344
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
- ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.681
Mary:
LARRY, DID YOU EAT
ALL THAT CAVIAR?

09:40.781 --> 09:43.617
- HUH? NO.
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

09:43.717 --> 09:45.853
I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOU TAKE A LITTLE, RIGHT?

09:45.953 --> 09:48.188
- HEY, IT WASN'T ME.
- THEN WHO WAS IT?

09:48.288 --> 09:51.524
CHRISTIAN SLATER WAS
EATING GOBFULS OF IT.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.860
- I HATE THAT.
- I COULDN'T EVEN
LOOK AT IT.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.561
- ( glass clinking )
- THAT'S...

09:54.662 --> 09:56.263
- SO INCONSIDERATE, NO?
- IT'S AN UNWRITTEN RULE.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.165
- YOU TAKE YOUR--
- UNWRITTEN RULE, EXACTLY.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.333
CAN I HAVE EVERYONE'S
ATTENTION, PLEASE?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.435
TED AND MARY,
OUR GRACIOUS HOSTS--

10:02.535 --> 10:05.605
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
TO AN INCREDIBLE COUPLE.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.974
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO GET YOU.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.809
YOU CLEARLY HAVE
EVERYTHING.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.610
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET YOU
A TOASTER OR A BLENDER,

10:10.711 --> 10:14.848
SO OUR INCREDIBLY
TALENTED DAUGHTER SAMMY,

10:14.948 --> 10:19.119
AS OUR GIFT TO YOU,
IS GONNA SING A SPECIAL SONG.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.122
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.
- Susie: SO LET'S HAVE
A NICE ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.425
- THAT'S A GIFT?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
- Susie: SAMMY IS GONNA SING.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.127
- LET'S HEAR IT FOR SAMMY.
- HOW IS THAT A GIFT?

10:27.227 --> 10:31.531
* YOU'RE JUST
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE *

10:31.631 --> 10:35.535
* CAN'T TAKE
MY EYES OFF OF YOU... *

10:35.635 --> 10:38.972
- ( whispers ) OH MY GOD.
- * YOU WOULD BE LIKE
HEAVEN TO TOUCH *

10:39.072 --> 10:42.509
* I WANNA
HOLD YOU SO MUCH *

10:42.609 --> 10:46.346
* AT LONG LAST
LOVE HAS ARRIVED *

10:46.446 --> 10:49.149
* AND I THANK GOD
I'M ALIVE... *

10:49.249 --> 10:51.384
( chuckles, whispers )
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.186
ARE YOU KIDDING?

10:53.286 --> 10:55.222
THIS IS THE WORST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.091
- * I LOVE YOU, BABY...
- Larry: ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.460
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.195
- VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD!
OKAY, THAT WAS WONDERFUL.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:02.295 --> 11:04.131
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- VERY GOOD TALENT.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.733
- I'M NOT-- I'M NOT DONE.
- NO NO NO NO, THAT WAS
TERRIFIC.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.767
NO NO, SHE'S NOT DONE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:06.867 --> 11:07.968
THAT WAS VERY GOOD.
VERY GOOD.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.903
WHY ARE YOU
INTERRUPTING HER, LARRY?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.739
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT
UNTIL SHE WAS FINISHED
SINGING THE SONG?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.573
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING?
- WHAT? THE SONG'S OVER.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.043
NO, THE SONG WAS
NOT OVER. YOU KNOW
THE SONG WAS NOT OVER

11:16.143 --> 11:18.045
- AND YOU CUT HER OFF!
- THE SONG IS OVER.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.981
YOU RUINED THE WHOLE GIFT!
THAT WAS OUR GIFT
FOR GOD'S SAKE!

11:21.081 --> 11:23.050
- OH, I THOUGHT
THE SONG WAS OVER.
- SAMMY, THAT WAS GREAT.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.119
LET'S GIVE HER A NICE
ROUND OF APPLAUSE.
THAT WAS GOOD.

11:26.219 --> 11:29.689
THAT WAS GOOD. YEAH.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.959
I'LL TELL YOU--
THAT'S A TALENTED KID.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.333
HEY! REAL NICE.
REAL NICE.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.173
COME-- I MEAN,
MARY IS PISSED AT ME
ABOUT THE CAVIAR.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.408
THANKS. THANKS A LOT.
THANK YOU.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.778
WHAT?
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

11:50.878 --> 11:52.245
SHE SAID
THAT YOU TOLD HER

11:52.345 --> 11:55.783
THAT I HELPED MYSELF
TO TOO MUCH CAVIAR.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.618
WELL, SHE NOTICED
THE CAVIAR

11:58.718 --> 11:59.853
AND ASKED ME
WHO ATE IT.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.721
WHAT? WHAT?
WAS I SUPPOSED TO LIE?

12:01.822 --> 12:04.291
- I WAS NOT TAKING
TOO MUCH CAVIAR!
- OH, PLEASE. ARE YOU KIDDING?

12:04.391 --> 12:07.194
- WHO ARE YOU?!
- YOU WERE EATING IT
LIKE IT WAS POTATO CHIPS!

12:07.294 --> 12:09.062
IT'S THERE
TO BE EATEN, YOU KNOW?

12:09.162 --> 12:11.264
- NOT BY ONE PERSON!
- IT WAS OUT THERE
ON THE TABLE.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.367
- YOU MADE IT
YOUR DINNER.
- OH GOD.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.203
( chuckles )

12:20.173 --> 12:21.741
SMILE.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.046
HEY, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.615
"SMILE."

12:28.715 --> 12:30.951
( beeps )

12:31.051 --> 12:33.053
- ( rings )
- HELLO.

12:33.153 --> 12:37.490
- Larry: Fat boy!
- WHAT? HELLO?

12:37.590 --> 12:40.828
- Jeff?
- UMM, NO.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.096
- NO, THERE'S NO JEFF HERE.
- IS THIS DR. MORRISON?

12:43.196 --> 12:45.899
UH, YEAH, IT IS.
IT IS. WHO'S THIS?

12:45.999 --> 12:47.667
OH MY GOD!
IT'S LARRY DAVID!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.302
Your patient
Larry David.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.738
AND WASN'T IT JUST
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO

12:51.839 --> 12:54.541
THAT I SAW YOU
AND ASKED YOU NOT
TO CALL HERE?

12:54.641 --> 12:56.910
NO, I WASN'T CALLING YOU.
I WAS CALLING JEFF GREENE--

12:57.010 --> 13:00.047
LISTEN-- AND YOUR NAME IS
RIGHT UNDER HIS

13:00.147 --> 13:01.949
AND I MUST HAVE PRESSED
YOURS BY ACCIDENT.

13:02.049 --> 13:05.752
I DISTINCTLY RECALL
ASKING YOU NOT TO CALL ME.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.054
NO NO, I DIDN'T CALL.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.189
HOW CAN YOU SAY
YOU DIDN'T CALL?!

13:09.289 --> 13:12.259
- YOU DID CALL.
- I DIDN'T CALL
PURPOSEFULLY.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.795
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
- AN ACCIDENT CALL IS
STILL A CALL.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.630
TECHNICALLY,
I CALLED, BUT--

13:17.730 --> 13:19.532
LOOK.
I'M IN THE OTHER ROOM

13:19.632 --> 13:21.368
I'M WORKING.
I HAD TO WALK IN HERE.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.170
I HAD TO PICK UP
THE PHONE.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.672
NOW I'M TALKING TO YOU.
THAT'S A CALL.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.307
IT'S A WRONG NUMBER.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.442
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
AN HOURGLASS SET UP HERE,

13:29.542 --> 13:31.178
BUT IT'S
THE LONGEST WRONG NUMBER

13:31.278 --> 13:32.880
I'VE EVER HAD
IN MY LIFE.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.714
I have things
to do, Mr. David.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.084
- REALLY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'm changing light bulbs

13:37.184 --> 13:39.319
AND CLEANING
THE CAT'S LITTER BOX.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.155
WHAT DO YOU DO AT HOME?
DOES ANYBODY ASK YOU
WHAT YOU DO--

13:42.255 --> 13:43.723
DON'T ASK ME
WHAT I DO AT HOME.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.692
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA HANG UP THEN.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.895
You don't have to tell me
everything you're doing.
Just hang up.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.063
Okay. The next time
you hear from me

13:50.163 --> 13:52.099
WILL BE IN CASE
OF AN EMERGENCY,

13:52.199 --> 13:53.867
AND I HOPE
YOU DON'T HEAR FROM ME.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.802
YOU STILL HAVE
MY SERVICE NUMBER.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.938
Call them,
ask about their day.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.672
DON'T BOTHER ME.

13:59.772 --> 14:03.110
- HMM.
- So did
you hang up yet?

14:03.210 --> 14:07.147
NOT YET.
SHOULD I HANG UP NOW?

14:07.247 --> 14:09.282
YES, I'M GOING
TO HANG UP NOW.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.184
DID I MENTION
THAT I'M GOING TO
THE RESTAURANT TONIGHT?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.120
- GOODBYE.
- ( phone clatters )

14:15.422 --> 14:18.625
BY THE WAY,
I'M NOT THAT IMPRESSED
WITH THE FOOD.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.027
IT'S GOOD.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.395
NO, I'M HAVING
A REAL PROBLEM
WITH THIS OSSO BUCO.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.631
I CAN'T BELIEVE
DR. MORRISON RECOMMENDED IT.
IT'S TERRIBLE.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.901
- YOU DON'T LIKE FOOD.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
I DON'T LIKE FOOD?

14:28.001 --> 14:29.869
YOU DON'T LIKE FOOD.
EVERY TIME WE'VE GONE OUT,

14:29.970 --> 14:32.039
- YOU'RE LIKE
"I DON'T LIKE THIS FOOD."
- NO, I DIDN'T LIKE YOUR FOOD.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.606
- THAT'S WHAT--
- YOU DIDN'T LIKE MY FOOD?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.442
YOUR FOOD-- COME ON,
YOU WERE THE WORST COOK
IN THE WORLD.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.310
- OH, STOP IT.
- YOU KNOW THAT.
"STOP IT."

14:37.410 --> 14:39.446
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
THAT THINKS THAT.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.615
- I THINK YOU'RE
NOT A GOOD... EATER.
- ( both laugh )

14:42.715 --> 14:46.186
- REALLY? YOU THINK I'M--
- YEAH, YOU'RE NOT
A GOOD EATER.

14:46.286 --> 14:50.323
ANYWAY, I'D BETTER SHUT UP,
BECAUSE I'M PLANNING ON--

14:50.423 --> 14:52.225
I'M PLANNING
ON A BIG MOVE LATER

14:52.325 --> 14:54.227
AND I THINK
I MIGHT HURT MY CHANCES

14:54.327 --> 14:56.196
IF I KEEP
CRITICIZING YOUR FOOD.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.398
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- YEAH.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.533
A BIG BIG MOVE.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.635
- IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.605
- A BIG STORM WARNING?
- I'M BABE RUTH CALLING
THE SHOT.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.408
ALL RIGHT.
OH, THERE'S YOUR
FRIEND TED DANSON.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.877
TED DANSON?

15:10.978 --> 15:13.280
NO, HE'S OVER THERE.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.751
- Mary Jane:
IS THAT WEIRD?
- IT WAS GREAT.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.453
YEAH, IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.490
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.295
- YOU'RE-- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- TO THE VINEYARD?

15:28.395 --> 15:30.163
- YEAH.
- YEAH, YOU COULD.
YOU COULD.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.599
- HEY, LARRY.
- Mary: HI.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.068
- HI, LAR.
- HEY, BUDDY.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.271
- ARE YOU HAVING A NICE TIME?
- YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.573
- THANK YOU, BUDDY.
- I FIND IT A LITTLE ODD,

15:40.673 --> 15:42.509
FRANKLY,

15:42.609 --> 15:46.046
THAT I GOT YOU THIS

15:46.146 --> 15:48.415
$300 GIFT CERTIFICATE
TO THE RESTAURANT

15:49.549 --> 15:52.619
AND YOU CHOSE
TO TAKE THEM AND NOT ME.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.721
BUT IF WE TOOK YOU,

15:54.821 --> 15:58.691
WOULDN'T THAT
BE YOU GIVING
A GIFT TO YOURSELF?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.460
- NO, NOT REALLY.
- YOU SOMEHOW--

16:00.560 --> 16:03.196
NO, I GAVE YOU A GIFT
AND I JUST THINK THAT

16:03.296 --> 16:05.265
THE NICE THING TO DO
WOULD HAVE BEEN

16:05.365 --> 16:07.467
"HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH US?"

16:07.567 --> 16:10.070
WAS THERE A STIPULATION
ON THE GIFT CERTIFICATE"

16:10.170 --> 16:12.205
- "$300 PLUS TAKE ME"?
- NO. NO,

16:12.305 --> 16:14.274
BUT DON'T YOU FEEL
A LITTLE BIT FUNNY

16:14.374 --> 16:16.343
- THAT YOU'RE EATING DINNER
UNDER-- IT'S MY MONEY?
- NOT AT ALL.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.012
- I PAID FOR YOUR GIFT.
- WHAT, HAVE YOU GOT
A BEEF WITH ME NOW?

16:19.112 --> 16:20.480
- YEAH?
- I'VE GOT
A SIDE BEEF WITH YOU.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.382
- I'VE GOT A BEEF WITH HIM.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.617
- WE'VE HAD A REALLY
NICE FUN NIGHT...
- DO ME A FAVOR.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.653
...WHICH IS MORE
THAN WE WOULD'VE HAD
IF WE'D BROUGHT YOU.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.188
FROM NOW ON
DON'T GET US A GIFT.
NO MORE GIFTS.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.023
AT LEAST I GOT YOU
A GIFT, OKAY?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.758
I DIDN'T LET MY DAUGHTER
GO UP AND SING A SONG.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.726
- WHAT THE HELL DOES
THAT MEAN, LARRY?
- OH, COME ON NOW.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.463
- IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE A GIFT?
- YES, THAT WAS A GIFT
FROM THE HEART.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.065
- THAT IS NOT A GIFT.
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:38.165 --> 16:39.699
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO SHUT HER UP.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.269
- THAT WAS MEAN.
THAT WAS CRUEL.
- IT WAS HORRIBLE.

16:42.369 --> 16:45.805
- IT WAS OVER THE LINE.
- HER SELF-ESTEEM IS DOWN
THE TOILET NOW.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.341
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT,
BUT IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH HER.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.810
I JUST-- I CAN'T
STAND THE SOUND
OF THE HUMAN VOICE.

16:50.910 --> 16:54.714
- YOU CAN'T STAND THE
SOUND OF THE HUMAN VOICE?!
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:54.814 --> 16:57.350
MY FATHER USED TO SING
IN THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME.
I COULDN'T TAKE IT.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.552
AND TO THIS DAY,
ANY SINGING AROUND ME--

16:59.652 --> 17:02.122
- YOU'RE FULL OF IT.
- Ted: BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.790
IT'S BULLSHIT.
HE'S MAKING IT UP.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.825
I'M NOT MAKING IT UP.
THIS HAPPENS TO
BE THE TRUTH.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.628
- Mary: I'VE NEVER HEARD
THIS ABOUT YOU, EVER.
- Ted: YEAH.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.231
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- ( accordion music playing )

17:11.331 --> 17:13.466
( singing Italian aria )

17:23.810 --> 17:25.312
HEY HEY HEY.
HEY HEY.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.414
THAT'S OKAY.
WE'VE GOT IT.
WE'VE GOT IT.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.282
WE'VE GOT IT.
WE'RE GOOD. HEY.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.418
( shushes )
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.386
PIPE IT DOWN.
WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.323
THAT'S OKAY. LOCK IT UP.
LOCK IT UP. WE'RE GOOD.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.258
VERY GOOD.
IT WAS VERY GOOD.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.693
- HONESTLY.
VERY GOOD. YEAH.
- ( applauding )

17:40.793 --> 17:43.062
YEAH, WE'RE--
WE'RE EATING NOW.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.965
WE'RE EATING.
WE CAN'T LISTEN NOW.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.901
COME ON.
RIGHT, PEOPLE?

17:49.001 --> 17:51.104
HUH? WHILE WE'RE EATING?
WE DON'T--

17:51.204 --> 17:53.506
WE DON'T NEED THAT.
COME ON.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.842
( Larry moaning )

18:01.981 --> 18:04.651
( groans )
DAMN IT.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.661
HEY, WOULD YOU MIND
SWITCHING SIDES?

18:15.962 --> 18:19.166
SWITCH SI-- SIDES?
UH, OKAY.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.733
- OKAY.
- I KINDA PREFER
THAT SIDE.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.068
- OH. ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.870
OH, HERE,
YOU-- YOU GO.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.173
- THANKS.
- BETTER?

18:26.273 --> 18:27.674
- MUCH BETTER.
- ALL GOOD?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.609
YOU'RE SO AGREEABLE.
I REALLY LOVE THAT
ABOUT YOU.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.444
UH-HUH. THANKS.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.554
( groaning )

18:43.556 --> 18:45.858
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
( laughs )

18:45.958 --> 18:48.595
OH, DAMN IT.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.003
- DO YOU WANT
SOME PIE?
- PIE?

18:57.103 --> 18:59.772
OH MY GOD,
IT'S DELICIOUS.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.874
- MMM.
- OH.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.710
- THIS IS SO GOOD.
- REALLY?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.445
I MADE IT.
DO YOU WANT SOME?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.947
- YOU MADE IT?
- YEAH, I TOOK
A DESSERT CLASS.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.250
IT IS DELICIOUS
AND I'M NOT KIDDING.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.419
- ( phone ringing )
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY IT.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.053
- HAVE IT.
IT'S GOOD. HONESTLY.
- OKAY, FINE.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.988
- ALL RIGHT.
- SORRY.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.057
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT KIND?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.959
OH, SHIT.

19:20.059 --> 19:22.695
- IT'S MY BOYFRIEND.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE QUIET.
- ( phone beeps )

19:22.795 --> 19:25.031
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING--
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU HAD A BOYFRIEND.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.800
HELLO?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:27.900 --> 19:29.436
UH-- OH, NOTHING.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.138
YOU KNOW, I WAS
JUST HANGING OUT,

19:32.239 --> 19:34.106
- NOT REALLY DOING
ANYTHING ACTUALLY.
- AH!

19:34.207 --> 19:37.544
- OH, WOW! WOW!
- OH! OH!

19:37.644 --> 19:40.247
OH, GOD.
NO NO, I'M WATCHING TV.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.581
IT'S LIKE
ON THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.883
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT IT TOMORROW?

19:43.983 --> 19:47.354
OH. OH, YOU ARE.

19:47.454 --> 19:50.757
THEN I'LL-- I'LL SEE YOU
IN A MINUTE. OKAY. BYE.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.325
- ( beeps )
- FUCK.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.126
- YOU'VE GOTTA GO.
- WHAT?

19:54.227 --> 19:55.362
MY BOYFRIEND'S
COMING OVER.

19:55.462 --> 19:56.663
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU HAD A BOYFRIEND.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.164
IT DIDN'T COME UP.
YOU DIDN'T ASK ME.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.899
WELL, IT SHOULD'VE
COME UP. NO?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.434
LISTEN.
YOU'VE GOTTA GO

20:01.534 --> 20:03.570
'CAUSE THIS WILL SUCK--
SERIOUSLY-- FOR ME.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.972
- DO YOU LIKE HIM?
- LARRY, YOU'VE GOT TO GO.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.540
I-- I CAN'T GET
INTO THIS NOW.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.175
- DID I LEAVE ANYTHING HERE?
- HELLO? NO, YOU'RE FINE.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.377
YOU'VE GOT TO GO.
LARRY, PLEASE.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.111
HE WILL NOT UNDERSTAND
THIS SITUATION.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.746
YEAH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE SITUATION.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.582
HE WILL KILL ME.
HE WILL KILL YOU.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.451
- KILL ME? IS HE A BIG GUY?
- YOU DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.722
I'M NOT KIDDING.
THE FOOD WAS JUST AWFUL.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.925
TERRIBLE. HONESTLY,
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
YOU RECOMMENDED THAT.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.727
WELL, I LIKED
THE OSSO BUCO.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.497
IT DIDN'T TASTE
LIKE OSSO BUCO TO ME.
IT WAS BAD OSSO BUCO.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.699
IT'D BE HARD
TO FIND A BETTER
OSSO BUCO THAN THAT.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.201
AH. ANYWAY,
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE CALL AGAIN.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.836
IT WAS
A COMPLETE ACCIDENT.

20:36.936 --> 20:40.106
YOU KNOW WHO
NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE
LIKE THAT? MY SERVICE.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.774
- REALLY? INTERESTING.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.710
- PLEASE DON'T CALL AGAIN.
- OKAY, BUT LIKE I SAID,

20:43.810 --> 20:46.212
IT WAS A WRONG NUMBER.
I DID NOT INTEND
TO CALL YOU.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.014
WELL, PERHAPS,
BUT IT WAS INTRUSIVE.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.016
YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL HOME,
BY THE WAY.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.352
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

20:52.452 --> 20:55.021
YOUR ASSISTANT GAVE ME
ALL YOUR INFO WHEN I ASKED
FOR YOUR HOME PHONE NUMBER.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.724
YOU'RE RIGHT
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
YOU'RE RIGHT UP THE STREET.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.759
YOU'RE THE HOUSE
ON THE CORNER WITH
THAT TRELLIS--

20:59.859 --> 21:01.394
- WHAT DO YOU
CALL IT, AN ARBOR?
- AN ARBOR.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.129
ARBOR. YEAH,
YOU'VE GOT THE ARBOR
IN THE FRONT.

21:03.229 --> 21:06.232
- I KNOW THAT HOUSE.
- YOU KNOW, I'M A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE

21:06.333 --> 21:09.235
- WITH YOU HAVING
ALL THIS INFORMATION.
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

21:09.336 --> 21:11.571
THERE SHOULD BE
A LITTLE MORE OPENNESS
IN THE DOCTOR BUSINESS.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.573
EVERYTHING IS
SO CONFIDENTIAL, YOU KNOW?

21:13.673 --> 21:16.476
I HAVE TOO MANY PATIENTS.
I DON'T WANT THEM ALL TO
HAVE MY INFORMATION.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.144
WELL, I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAS IT.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.746
WELL, DON'T CALL,
DON'T KNOCK ON THE DOOR...

21:19.846 --> 21:21.948
- OH YEAH.
- ...BUT YOU'RE
WELCOME HERE ANY TIME

21:22.048 --> 21:23.816
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
- OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.353
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK WE SHOULD DO
ABOUT THE HAND?

21:26.453 --> 21:28.388
THERE ARE TWO WAYS
TO GO WITH THE HAND:

21:28.488 --> 21:30.823
PUT A BANDAGE ON;
NOT PUT A BANDAGE ON.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.259
IN MY OPINION,
IT'D BE BETTER
TO LEAVE IT OPEN.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.563
WELL, ARE YOU
THE SAME PERSON

21:36.663 --> 21:39.131
WHO RECOMMENDED
THAT RESTAURANT
WITH THE OSSO BUCO?

21:39.231 --> 21:40.633
I DON'T QUITE
SEE THE CONNECTION.

21:40.733 --> 21:43.836
WELL, YOUR RESTAURANT
RECOMMENDATION WAS SO AWFUL,

21:43.936 --> 21:47.106
I JUST DON'T SEE
HOW I CAN TRUST
YOUR MEDICAL RECOMMENDATION.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.808
THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.710
NOT TO ME.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.580
- WRAP IT UP.
- YOU WANT IT WRAPPED UP?

21:53.680 --> 21:56.516
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.857
( phone rings )

22:04.957 --> 22:06.393
( beeps )

22:06.493 --> 22:08.495
- HELLO?
- LARRY?
HI, IT'S MARY JANE.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.563
OH, HEY,
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?
I'M EXERCISING.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.400
UH, NO, YOU KNOW,
MY FRIEND--

22:13.500 --> 22:15.435
HE FOUND YOUR BANDAGE
IN THE GARBAGE CAN HERE

22:15.535 --> 22:17.236
AND HE KNOWS IT'S YOU.
HE KNOWS YOU WERE HERE.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.338
- WHAT?
- Yeah, it was
really horrible.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.374
I KIND OF FREAKED OUT
AND I ENDED UP GIVING HIM

22:21.474 --> 22:23.309
YOUR-- YOUR PHONE NUMBER
AND YOUR ADDRESS.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.211
ARE YOU CRAZY?!
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

22:25.311 --> 22:26.679
I know, I'm sorry.
It's crazy,

22:26.779 --> 22:28.415
BUT HE JUST--
HE JUST WORE ME DOWN.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.483
IT WAS SO HORRIBLE,

22:30.583 --> 22:33.119
AND HE'S ON HIS WAY
TO YOUR HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.854
- OH MY.
- ( beeps )

22:36.188 --> 22:38.458
( car approaches )

22:40.460 --> 22:42.629
OH, SHIT.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.821
HI, DR. MORRISON.
I'M SO SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,

23:08.921 --> 23:11.323
HONESTLY--
SOMEBODY'S AFTER ME.
THEY'RE AT MY HOUSE.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.125
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO!

23:13.225 --> 23:16.328
I WAS RUNNING
AND I SAW YOUR HOUSE.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.064
MR. DAVID, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:18.164 --> 23:19.832
I'M-- I'M TELLING YOU--
I JUST NEED A PLACE TO STAY.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.502
IF I COULD JUST
STAY HERE FOR A WHILE,
SPEND THE NIGHT.

23:22.602 --> 23:25.438
- YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN'T.
YOU CAN'T-- SPEND THE NIGHT?
- I'LL GO IN THE GUEST ROOM.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.206
I'LL CLOSE THE DOOR.
YOU WON'T EVEN
KNOW I'M HERE!

23:27.306 --> 23:29.742
I'M SITTING HERE
HAVING A NICE, QUIET
NIGHT WITH MY WIFE,

23:29.842 --> 23:32.311
WE'RE HAVING A GLASS OF WINE,
AND YOU BUST IN HERE SAYING

23:32.411 --> 23:35.014
- YOU WANT TO STAY
HERE ALL NIGHT?!
- HELLO. I'M SO SORRY.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.650
PLEASE PLEASE
PLEASE DON'T INVOLVE
MRS. MORRISON.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.418
I'M NOT INVOLVING HER.
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HOME
BY THE WAY.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.387
- THANK YOU.
- LOVELY. I LOVE
THAT PRINT.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.490
AND I THINK IT'S
A LITTLE PROVOCATIVE,

23:43.590 --> 23:45.224
COMING IN HERE LIKE THIS
IN FRONT OF MY WIFE

23:45.324 --> 23:47.460
WITH NO PANTS ON!
YOU SHOULD GO HOME
AND GET DRESSED.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.462
I WAS RUNNING OUT!
I RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.097
I GIVE YOU
MY PHONE NUMBER,
YOU CALL ME.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.733
YOU DRIVE BY MY HOUSE.
NOW YOU'RE IN MY HOUSE?

23:53.833 --> 23:56.135
HOW ABOUT IF
I JUST HANG OUT HERE?
I'LL SIT ON THE STEPS.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.937
WHAT, ALL NIGHT?
SIT ON THE STEPS?

23:58.037 --> 24:00.072
- WELL, I CAN'T GO OUT!
- MY FAMILY IS HERE!

24:00.172 --> 24:02.575
DO YOU MIND IF I STAY
ON THE STEPS, MRS. MORRISON?

24:02.675 --> 24:04.677
NO NO, MRS. MORRISON DOES--
YOU'RE NOT STAYING
ON THE STEPS.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.179
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
YOU'RE SENDING ME
OUT TO GET HURT.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.648
WHAT ABOUT
THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH?

24:08.748 --> 24:10.583
WHEN YOU'RE HURT, COME BACK
AND I'LL TREAT YOU.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.585
- GO HOME, MR. DAVID!
- DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS?

24:12.685 --> 24:14.386
- YOU SAY YOU ONLY LIVE--
- DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS?

24:14.487 --> 24:16.222
PLEASE! DON'T BRING
MRS. MORRISON INTO THIS.

24:16.322 --> 24:18.157
- FINE.
- AND I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO PUT SOME PANTS ON.

24:18.257 --> 24:20.426
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
GETTING A CALL FROM ME SOON--

24:20.527 --> 24:22.428
AN EMERGENCY CALL.
I HAVE YOUR HOME PHONE NUMBER

24:22.529 --> 24:24.731
- AND I'M GOING TO BE
MAKING AN EMERGENCY CALL!
- CALL MY SERVICE!

24:24.831 --> 24:26.365
I'M CALLING
AN EMERGENCY CALL TO YOU!

24:26.465 --> 24:28.601
DON'T CALL ME,
AND I'LL CALL YOU!

24:43.650 --> 24:46.418
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HOME.
YOU'VE GOT TO LET ME COME IN
AND SPEND THE NIGHT.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.420
SOMEBODY'S CHASING ME.
THERE'S A GUY AFTER ME.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.289
I SWEAR TO GOD!
I'M NOT MAKING IT UP!

24:50.389 --> 24:53.125
- WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
- WHAT? I'M WEARING SHORTS.

24:53.225 --> 24:56.062
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.
- I WORKOUT IN SHORTS.
I'M SORRY.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.065
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU REALLY DISAPPOINTED
ME LAST NIGHT.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.634
THAT SWEET GUY TRYING
TO SING A SONG--

25:01.734 --> 25:04.436
YOU ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED
HIS CONFIDENCE.
YOU KNOW THAT?

25:04.537 --> 25:06.305
HE CAN'T SING
ANYMORE BECAUSE OF YOU.

25:06.405 --> 25:09.876
WELL, I'LL-- YOU KNOW,
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.544
- TALK TO HIM?
- I WILL. I WILL.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.645
YEAH, BUILD UP
HIS CONFIDENCE AFTER THAT.

25:12.745 --> 25:13.846
I ACTUALLY WILL.
I'LL DO THAT.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.114
YOU ARE A SELFISH
MOTHERFUCKER.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.115
- I'M SELFISH?
- YOU ARE.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.650
I BUY YOU
A FANTASTIC GIFT,

25:17.750 --> 25:19.852
AND YOU TAKE JEFF GREENE?
THAT'S $150.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.821
- SO WHAT?
- THAT'S MY $150!

25:21.921 --> 25:23.355
- IS THAT WHAT'S
BOTHERING YOU? $150?
- AT LEAST I GAVE YOU

25:23.455 --> 25:24.924
A PRESENT.
I DIDN'T HAVE MY DAUGHTER

25:25.024 --> 25:26.793
- SING SOME BULLSHIT SONG...
- HERE. HERE'S YOUR $150.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.327
- TAKE YOUR $150...
- ...AND NOT BE ABLE
TO CARRY A TUNE!

25:28.427 --> 25:31.631
...AND GO BUY YOURSELF SOME
FUCKING PANTS, WILL YOU?

25:36.268 --> 25:38.605
( tires screech )
