Okay. You have an extra one?

00:20.139 --> 00:21.765
Go ahead, put it on. Hurry.

00:21.848 --> 00:24.017
Yeah, I do, but, like,
I was all up in there.

00:24.101 --> 00:25.978
Are you on birth control and stuff?

00:26.061 --> 00:28.147
No, but you didn't finish, right?

There's those little guys

You know?

Should we maybe get a pill to be safe?

00:36.905 --> 00:40.159

00:40.241 --> 00:41.576
No, no.

00:41.660 --> 00:42.953
You can't get pregnant from pre-come.

same situation.

00:47.874 --> 00:49.292
Now they got a kid. His name's Samson.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.585

No, no. I know this guy.

00:51.670 --> 00:52.754
He's a friend of mine.

00:52.838 --> 00:53.839
That's what anecdotal means.

00:53.922 --> 00:55.090
You take one example,

00:55.174 --> 00:56.675
and you apply it to everything else.

00:56.758 --> 00:58.927
- Oh, then that's anecdotal.
- Yeah.

00:59.011 --> 01:00.804

01:00.887 --> 01:02.014

01:02.097 --> 01:03.098

Let's just Google it now,

01:05.851 --> 01:07.102
Okay, peace of mind. Okay.

01:07.186 --> 01:09.270
- Peace of mind. Yeah.
- Great. Okay.

01:17.237 --> 01:19.531
All right.

01:19.614 --> 01:21.908
Uh...

01:21.992 --> 01:23.409
Okay, right here.

01:23.493 --> 01:25.328
"Pre-come does not contain sperm."

01:25.411 --> 01:26.955
Okay.

01:27.039 --> 01:29.582
Um, I'm on this other site,

01:29.666 --> 01:31.417
and it says,

01:31.501 --> 01:34.129
"Yes, the pre-ejaculate fluid
itself does not contain sperm.

01:34.213 --> 01:36.089
As the pre-ejaculate
leaves the body, however,

01:36.173 --> 01:38.383
it may pick up sperm
from a previous ejaculation

01:38.466 --> 01:40.468
that remains in the urethra."

these other guys are just hanging out,

the last time you ejaculated?

Mm...

01:47.267 --> 01:48.727
I mean, earlier tonight.

01:48.810 --> 01:50.062

Fine. You guys get vanilla.

17:30.126 --> 17:31.794
I'm gonna try
the strawberry cheesecake.

17:31.877 --> 17:33.004
No, you have to get vanilla.

17:33.087 --> 17:34.005
We all get vanilla.

17:34.088 --> 17:35.255
Vanilla.

17:35.339 --> 17:36.548
But I want to try the cheesecake.

17:36.632 --> 17:38.383
No! Vanilla!

17:38.467 --> 17:41.179
Vanilla, vanilla, vanilla!

17:41.261 --> 17:44.015
Another reason I want to be a spy is,

17:44.098 --> 17:45.683
I'll get a laser gun.

17:47.392 --> 17:48.602
Whoa.

17:48.686 --> 17:50.729
Dev, I have to use the bathroom.

17:50.813 --> 17:52.481
All right, well, can we go at your house?

17:52.564 --> 17:53.732
We're almost there.

17:53.816 --> 17:55.317
Now!

17:55.400 --> 17:56.986
All right.

17:57.069 --> 17:57.987
Come on.

17:59.363 --> 18:00.322
All right, that's you.

18:00.405 --> 18:01.406
Go for it.

18:01.490 --> 18:02.867
No, I want you to come.

18:02.950 --> 18:04.535
In the bathroom? No, I can't do that.

18:04.618 --> 18:06.120
That's frowned upon in the adult world.

18:06.204 --> 18:07.246
But I want you to come.

18:07.329 --> 18:09.248
I can't go in there by myself.

18:09.331 --> 18:11.083
I'll be right here. It'll be fine.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.127
But it's scary when the door closes.

18:13.211 --> 18:14.962
I get scared.

18:15.046 --> 18:19.133
All right, let me see if one
of these ladies will go, okay?

18:19.217 --> 18:21.886
Um, excuse me, madam,

18:21.969 --> 18:24.680
would you mind accompanying
this young lady I'm babysitting

18:24.763 --> 18:25.764
into the bathroom?

18:25.848 --> 18:27.016
She's a little scared.

18:27.099 --> 18:28.184
Why didn't you ask me?

18:28.267 --> 18:30.602
Am I not enough of a madam?

18:30.686 --> 18:32.646
Uh, no, I just thought she looked like

18:32.730 --> 18:34.314
more of a mom-type person.

18:34.398 --> 18:35.858
Oh, so you think I'm old?

18:35.941 --> 18:37.235
Aw, come on. I didn't say old.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.485
I said mom-type.

18:38.569 --> 18:39.820
I didn't mean anything by that.

18:39.904 --> 18:42.031
I mean, come on. Just-- Do you mind?

18:42.114 --> 18:43.949
It would really--
I just don't want--

18:44.033 --> 18:46.368
I need to go now.

18:47.828 --> 18:50.039
All right, well, guess I'm doing this.

18:50.122 --> 18:51.249
Thanks.

18:54.585 --> 18:56.336
You know,

18:56.420 --> 18:58.547
I understand why you're not helping me.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.216
But I just want you to know in my heart,

19:00.299 --> 19:03.094
I meant no offense to either of you.

19:03.177 --> 19:04.428
Please watch Grant.

19:07.389 --> 19:08.807
So...

19:08.891 --> 19:10.475
what exactly do you need me to do here?

19:10.559 --> 19:12.728
Just keep me company.

19:12.811 --> 19:13.979
So don't clean up or anything?

19:14.063 --> 19:14.980
No.

19:15.064 --> 19:15.981
I'm a big girl.

19:16.065 --> 19:17.608
Great. I got that.

19:17.691 --> 19:19.151
All right,
so I'll just stand in the corner,

19:19.235 --> 19:20.360
and you do your thing, okay?

19:20.444 --> 19:21.653
Mm-hmm.

19:21.737 --> 19:22.988
And, you know, don't tell anyone

19:23.072 --> 19:23.989
I took you to the bathroom.

19:24.073 --> 19:25.324
It's a little weird.

19:25.407 --> 19:27.451
- I know it's weird.
- All right.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.911
Go for it.

19:30.454 --> 19:31.997
Uh, you know, I'm gonna make a noise

19:32.081 --> 19:33.457
so I don't hear what's happening,
all right?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.334
- Okay.
- Don't get scared, okay?

19:35.417 --> 19:38.796
All right. I'm not scared.

19:50.808 --> 19:52.517
- Done?
- Yeah.

19:52.601 --> 19:54.478
Cool. Wash your hands.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.813
Let's get the fuck out of here.

19:55.896 --> 19:58.023
- Yeah!
- I hate melons!

20:00.109 --> 20:01.693
Guys, we're two minutes from your house.

20:01.777 --> 20:02.903
Do you really need to do this?

20:02.987 --> 20:04.613
- Yes, let's go!
- Yeah, fun!

20:07.950 --> 20:09.285
Ah, shit, okay.

20:09.368 --> 20:10.744
We got to go get some beer for your mom.

20:10.828 --> 20:12.997
Come on, let's go.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.333
Hmm, summer ale.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.126
Hey, where's Grant?

20:17.209 --> 20:18.169
I don't know.

20:18.252 --> 20:19.753
Grant?

20:19.837 --> 20:20.879
Grant.

20:20.963 --> 20:22.298
Grant!

20:22.381 --> 20:23.299
Hey, Grant!

20:23.382 --> 20:24.549
Where are you?

20:24.633 --> 20:26.177
Excuse me. Is he with you, sir?

20:26.260 --> 20:28.553
Uh, yeah, he's my friend's kid.

20:28.637 --> 20:29.554
Everything okay?

20:29.680 --> 20:31.265
He's taking his penis

20:31.349 --> 20:32.975
and rubbing it on all
the packages of frozen waffles.

20:33.058 --> 20:34.476
Wha-- Grant!

20:34.559 --> 20:35.978
You can't do that!
Why are you doing that?

20:36.061 --> 20:37.313
It's cold, and when I put

20:37.396 --> 20:39.106
my wiener against it, it feels good.

20:41.066 --> 20:42.693
I'm gonna need you
to pay for the waffles, sir.

20:42.776 --> 20:44.444
All right, fine.
Just give it to me. I'll buy it.

20:44.528 --> 20:45.696
No, I'm gonna need you to pay
for all 30 packages

20:45.779 --> 20:46.864
in the display case.

20:46.947 --> 20:47.948
30 packages? Come on, man.

20:48.032 --> 20:49.533
He was gone for a minute.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.118
He didn't put his thing
on all those packages.

20:51.202 --> 20:52.452
We can't sell waffles
that have made contact

20:52.536 --> 20:54.038
with a young boy's genitals.

20:54.121 --> 20:55.664
Just pay for the waffles.

20:55.747 --> 20:57.708
All right, fine. I'll pay for it.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.793
I can pay for it. I have a wallet.

20:59.877 --> 21:01.086
Whose wallet is this?

21:01.170 --> 21:02.254
I took it from the party.

21:02.338 --> 21:03.964
This is Kyle's wallet.

21:04.048 --> 21:05.966
He went to the bathroom with me

21:06.050 --> 21:07.801
and said not to tell anybody.

21:11.055 --> 21:13.557
Goddamn.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.599
Oof.

21:16.727 --> 21:18.270
Hey, man.

21:18.354 --> 21:22.024
Sorry,
I guess Grant stole your wallet earlier.

21:22.107 --> 21:24.818
Oh, thanks. Just put it anywhere.

21:24.902 --> 21:26.320
All right.

21:26.404 --> 21:28.989
You mind if I use your restroom
real quick?

21:29.073 --> 21:30.866
Yeah, it's upstairs.

21:30.949 --> 21:32.576
I'll show you.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.578
Thanks.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.706
Hey, you guys, you sit here.

21:37.789 --> 21:40.167
You don't touch anything.
You don't steal anything.

21:40.251 --> 21:42.794
Okay, and Grant,
you stay away from the freezer.

21:48.133 --> 21:51.220
Man, I was just watching
those guys for, like, an hour,

21:51.303 --> 21:52.346
and I'm destroyed.

21:52.430 --> 21:53.889
You had a kid for a year.

21:53.972 --> 21:55.557
How do you do it? What's your secret?

21:55.640 --> 21:58.227
My secret is, I'm getting a divorce.

21:59.853 --> 22:02.398
What? Are you serious?

22:02.481 --> 22:04.442
We've just been dealing
with some issues lately.

22:04.524 --> 22:07.111
We tried to figure it out.
I don't think it's gonna work.

22:07.194 --> 22:08.820
I thought everything
was going really well.

22:08.904 --> 22:10.530
What about all that stuff
you said earlier?

22:10.614 --> 22:11.573
Oh, come on, man.

22:11.656 --> 22:12.991
That's bullshit you say at a party.

22:13.075 --> 22:14.618
What am I supposed to say?

22:14.701 --> 22:16.412
I don't sleep. I haven't fucked in a year.

22:16.495 --> 22:19.415
I never see my friends. I hate my wife.

22:19.498 --> 22:21.166
God.

22:21.250 --> 22:25.212
Yeah,
I guess that's not really good party...

22:25.296 --> 22:27.839
What's the word?

22:27.923 --> 22:29.883
Party...

22:29.967 --> 22:30.884
fodder.

22:30.968 --> 22:32.428
Fodder, yeah.

22:32.511 --> 22:33.845
It's tough, man.

22:33.929 --> 22:35.473
We'd only been dating six months.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.974
Brenda got pregnant,

22:37.057 --> 22:38.850
and we really thought
we could pull it off.

22:38.934 --> 22:40.102
It started off okay,

22:40.185 --> 22:41.937
but then things got a little rocky.

22:42.020 --> 22:44.064
It was just too soon.

22:44.148 --> 22:45.565
And then you throw a kid in the mix...

22:45.649 --> 22:46.691
And Zach's awesome.

22:46.775 --> 22:48.319
We couldn't love him any more,

22:48.402 --> 22:51.822
but it just wasn't enough
to keep us together.

22:51.905 --> 22:53.198
Anyway, here's the bathroom.

22:53.282 --> 22:55.534
All right.

22:55.617 --> 22:58.078
Man, it smells really nice in there.

22:58.162 --> 23:00.289
You got to hit me
with the deets on that candle.

23:00.372 --> 23:02.666
Sorry.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.460
It is a great candle.

Hey, Nathan's coming with the sandwiches.

23:57.762 --> 23:59.723
- Oh, great.
- Hey, penguin.

23:59.806 --> 24:00.640
How did it go?

24:00.724 --> 24:01.725
Oh, my God.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.394
It felt like ten years.

24:03.477 --> 24:05.479
Anytime I turned around,
they were just causing mayhem.

24:05.563 --> 24:06.897
I'm sure you did fine.

24:06.980 --> 24:08.732
I didn't see any blood, so that's good.

You guys, come with me.

24:20.994 --> 24:22.538
Hey, what's happening? You okay?

24:22.621 --> 24:25.541
I just watched Grant and Lila
for a couple hours.

24:25.624 --> 24:26.625
Jesus.

24:26.708 --> 24:28.001
It was so crazy.

24:28.085 --> 24:29.253
They're just, like, running around

24:29.336 --> 24:30.421
and screaming and yelling,

24:30.504 --> 24:31.422
causing a ruckus.

24:31.505 --> 24:32.423
That's rough, man.

24:32.506 --> 24:34.425
That's why I enjoy being the uncle,
you know?

24:34.508 --> 24:35.842
Like, 'cause you just show up.

24:35.926 --> 24:37.219
You hug 'em. You kiss 'em.

24:37.302 --> 24:38.845
You play with 'em. You make a mess.

24:38.929 --> 24:41.098
And then when they start getting
gross and being dicks,

24:41.181 --> 24:43.100
you're like,
"I'm getting the fuck out of here."

24:43.183 --> 24:44.726
- And you do. You leave.
- Yeah.

24:44.809 --> 24:47.521
Yeah, I get why you and Kate
don't have kids.

24:47.605 --> 24:49.565
Yeah, it can definitely be very nice.

24:49.648 --> 24:51.983
You know,
we have a lot of time to ourselves.

24:52.067 --> 24:53.693
Are you guys doing
anything fun for the summer?

24:53.777 --> 24:56.363
Yeah, we are going to Italy.

24:56.447 --> 24:58.031
We rented a villa in the Amalfi Coast.

24:58.115 --> 24:59.824
That sounds amazing.

24:59.908 --> 25:02.244
You know what Amanda
and James are doing this summer?

25:02.327 --> 25:04.162
They're taking a trip to Costco--

25:04.246 --> 25:05.872
Yeah, to buy a bunch of grape juice

25:05.956 --> 25:08.917
and diapers or whatever fucking
kid shit they have to buy.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.335
I love Costco.

25:10.419 --> 25:12.254
They're nice to me over there.

25:12.337 --> 25:14.005
Like, they act like they know me,

25:14.089 --> 25:16.883
even though, like, thousands
of people go in there every day.

25:16.967 --> 25:18.469
You know, they always are like,

25:18.552 --> 25:19.761
"Hey, that's that guy."

25:19.886 --> 25:21.054
I'm there a lot.

25:21.138 --> 25:22.514
Hey, guys. Get ready.

25:22.598 --> 25:23.682
These Parm sandwiches are delicious.

25:23.807 --> 25:25.225
Oh, my God.

25:25.309 --> 25:27.060
Thanks so much for grabbing these, Nathan.

25:27.144 --> 25:28.646
Dude, I'm so hungry.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.398
Mommy, we finished our sandwiches.

25:31.482 --> 25:33.609
Oh, you made that for me.

25:33.692 --> 25:35.569
Mm-hmm.

25:35.653 --> 25:38.196
It's our first sandwich ever.
We want you to have it.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.532
It has peanut butter and lettuce.

25:40.616 --> 25:42.033
I added the ketchup.

25:42.117 --> 25:45.496
Oh, wow. This looks delicious.

25:45.579 --> 25:47.456
You know, the sandwiches look pretty good,

25:47.539 --> 25:51.293
but I think I'm gonna have to go
with Grant and Lila's instead.

25:55.046 --> 25:56.340
We made one for Dev, too.

25:56.423 --> 25:58.967
Whoa. You made one for me?

25:59.050 --> 26:00.636
- Yes.
- Aw, thanks.

26:00.719 --> 26:02.971
And we drew you a picture to go with it.

26:03.054 --> 26:04.640
Whoa.

26:04.723 --> 26:06.350
Grant, Lila, and Dev.
