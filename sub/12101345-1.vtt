[gunship engines roaring]

<i>Separatists pushed to the brink.</i>

00:55.513 --> 00:58.099
<i>Republic forces</i>
<i>continue to mount victories</i>

00:58.183 --> 01:00.185
<i>on battlefronts across the galaxy.</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:04.689
<i>After the Jedi Knights thwarted an attempt</i>
<i>to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine,</i>

01:04.773 --> 01:08.026
<i>the evil droid, General Grievous,</i>
<i>retreated to the Outer Rim.</i>

01:08.443 --> 01:11.196
<i>With his legions of battle droids</i>
<i>severely depleted,</i>

01:11.279 --> 01:15.784
<i>Grievous mounts a desperate and brutal</i>
<i>counterattack across several star systems.</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:19.704
<i>We find Republic clone troopers</i>
<i>locked in deadly combat</i>

01:19.788 --> 01:21.664
<i>on the besieged world of Kaller.</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:24.292
<i>Lead by Jedi Master Depa Billaba,</i>

01:24.376 --> 01:29.381

01:42.102 --> 01:43.103
Fire.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.068
[clone troopers screaming, groaning]

01:52.237 --> 01:53.488
Not to be a pessimist,

01:53.571 --> 01:56.282
but if the commander isn't back soon
with those reinforcements...

01:56.366 --> 01:58.493
My Padawan will be here.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.577
[Caleb] Master!

02:02.664 --> 02:04.916
Here. I'm here.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.836
Caleb, where are the reinforcements?

02:07.919 --> 02:10.171
Don't worry. They're right behind me.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.551
Uh, where are they?

02:14.634 --> 02:15.802
Caleb.

02:15.885 --> 02:16.928
Trust me.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.347
-Well, how many are there?
-Five of them.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.975
Five? We're done.

02:22.058 --> 02:25.311
Yeah, that's what I thought,
but you gotta see these clones.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.230
They're different.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.733
[rumbling]

02:32.694 --> 02:33.945
Halt.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.410
[rumbling continues]

02:40.493 --> 02:41.578
Fire.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.334
No. No.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.878
Hold your positions.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.882
Make a hole!

02:53.965 --> 02:55.008
[battle droid] Hey!

03:15.445 --> 03:18.531
I don't believe it. That's Clone Force 99.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.660
[Wrecker laughing]

03:23.703 --> 03:26.039
Crosshair, let's get these tanks moving.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.919
Sir, yes, sir.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.510
[grunting]

03:46.434 --> 03:49.312
Huh? Hey. Stop that.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.315
Adjust the stabilizers. We're going over.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.318
Hey, clanker. Catch.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.278
Huh? [groans]

04:15.338 --> 04:17.132
I guess I'm in charge now.

04:19.384 --> 04:22.012
Hey. What's that?

04:23.888 --> 04:24.889
Oh, no--

04:44.117 --> 04:46.036
[battle droid]
Drop your weapons and surrender.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.871
[groans]

04:53.793 --> 04:58.340
If you're done hiding down there,
I suggest you launch a counterattack.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.467
Another droid battalion's approaching.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.094
The general is the one
who gives the orders around here.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.597
He's right, Captain. This is our chance.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.640
Launch the counterattack.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.809
Yes, General.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.853
All right, men. Let's go!

05:11.936 --> 05:14.356
[clone trooper]
Sir, yes, sir. Move it! Move it!

05:14.939 --> 05:16.649
[clone trooper shouting]

05:17.484 --> 05:20.820
There you are, little Jedi.
You missed all the fun.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.615
Watching your team in action was the fun.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.034
Care to introduce your new friends, Caleb?

05:26.117 --> 05:27.160
Yes, Master.

05:27.243 --> 05:32.916
This is Wrecker, Hunter,
Echo, Tech and Crosshair.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.836
While I'm not sure "fun"
is the sentiment I would express,

05:36.920 --> 05:38.713
I agree with my Padawan.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.466
Your exploits were quite impressive.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.259
Exploits?

05:43.927 --> 05:45.595
Don't overthink it, Wrecker.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.055
Thank you, General.

05:47.138 --> 05:51.768
Now, would one of you please explain
where my actual reinforcements are?

05:51.851 --> 05:55.563
Rerouted to the capital.
We're all you're getting.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.899
Ha! We're all you need.

05:57.982 --> 06:02.195
Actually, if my intel is correct,
the general will not need any of us.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.614
The Clone War may soon be over.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.409
Better tell that
to the clankers headed our way.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.495
I am referring
to the encrypted comm chatter.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.957
Clone intelligence is reporting
Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi

06:14.040 --> 06:17.544
has found and engaged
General Grievous on Utapau.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.755
If he captures or kills Grievous,

06:20.839 --> 06:23.466
the Separatist command structure
will collapse.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.136
And most likely the droid armies
along with them.

06:26.219 --> 06:30.807
A fascinating theory, yet unfortunately
not something we can control from here.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.518
I suggest we focus on the task at hand.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.979
Any orders?

06:36.062 --> 06:39.024
Or shall we do what we do?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.526
Let's blow something up. Yeah!

06:42.360 --> 06:47.073
Well, Caleb, shall we let them
do what they do?

06:47.157 --> 06:49.117
Only if I can go with them.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.410
Very well.

06:50.493 --> 06:55.081
Hey, kid. You ready for this?
We move fast.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.834
Good. That's the only way I know.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.170
[Wrecker laughs]

07:00.253 --> 07:01.796
I like him.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.299
[comm beeps]

07:10.972 --> 07:12.849

07:12.932 --> 07:16.686
<i>Execute Order 66.</i>

07:21.524 --> 07:24.194
[blasters firing]

07:32.410 --> 07:33.703
Master.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.916
Master!

07:49.928 --> 07:51.346
You must run!

07:55.016 --> 07:56.393
Run, Caleb!

07:58.603 --> 08:01.815
[groaning, screams]

08:01.898 --> 08:03.108
[gasps]

08:06.486 --> 08:07.821
Stay away from me!

08:11.032 --> 08:12.200
Kid, wait!

08:17.455 --> 08:19.708
What-- What just happened?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.918
The comm channel
is repeating one directive,

08:22.002 --> 08:24.587
"Execute Order 66."

08:24.671 --> 08:26.464
Yeah, I heard that too.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.425
What's Order 66?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.593
I am not certain.

08:31.678 --> 08:35.515
Echo. Tech. Talk to the reg Captain.
Find out what you can.

08:36.516 --> 08:40.186
Crosshair, you and I will track down the
kid and make sure nothing happens to him.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.314
Wrecker, stall anyone
who tries to follow us.

09:11.593 --> 09:12.635
He's close.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.972
[footsteps]

09:16.431 --> 09:17.432
There.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.811
Come on down, kid.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.855
We're here to help. No!

09:24.647 --> 09:25.857
Liar.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.443
What are you doing?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.279
Following orders.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.365
We don't even know what the order is.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.451
Stand down until we know what's going on.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.083
Good soldiers follow orders.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.342
Where's the Padawan?

09:52.425 --> 09:55.929
Yeah, don't worry. Hunter's handling it.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.182
We have orders
from the Supreme Chancellor himself.

09:59.265 --> 10:04.145
That's great,
but like I said, Hunter's handling it.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.563
Step aside, Trooper.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.234
Sure thing, boss.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.862
Hunter, you've got regs inbound.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.322
[Hunter] Copy that.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.491
[Tech] <i>We have a situation.</i>

10:17.033 --> 10:18.868
Tell me something I don't know, Tech.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.038
<i>It appears the regs have been ordered</i>
<i>to execute the Jedi.</i>

10:22.122 --> 10:24.040
What? Which Jedi?

10:24.124 --> 10:28.378
<i>All of them. They're saying</i>
<i>the Jedi have committed treason.</i>

10:28.461 --> 10:30.338
[Crosshair] That would explain things.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.716
It doesn't begin to explain things.

10:33.216 --> 10:34.884
[Tech] <i>I suggest you get back here.</i>

10:35.301 --> 10:37.053
Can't. Haven't found the kid yet.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.057
Wrong.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.518
[Caleb grunting]

10:55.447 --> 10:56.948
[Hunter] Crosshair, stand down.

11:00.910 --> 11:01.911
Don't!

11:07.000 --> 11:08.418
[Hunter] Take it easy, kid.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.298
Easy.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.469
I'm on your side.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.064
[water rushing]

11:40.658 --> 11:41.785
Stay back.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.081
Just hear me out.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.667
No! You killed her!

11:49.376 --> 11:54.089
[sighs] The others did.
I'm just as confused as you are.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.230
Stay back. Stay back!

12:12.065 --> 12:15.944
I can help you. Come with me.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.710
[clone trooper]
<i>I'm sure he went this way. Come on!</i>

12:34.087 --> 12:35.296
No!

12:54.566 --> 12:55.900
Where's the Jedi?

12:56.401 --> 12:59.738
I stunned him when he jumped.
He didn't make it.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.894
We're coming up on Kamino.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.563
It's good to be home.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.065
How long has it been?

13:35.565 --> 13:38.318
One hundred and eighty rotations
in a standard cycle,

13:38.401 --> 13:42.655
but galactic zone changes
put the adjusted figure at around 205.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.449
What?

13:44.532 --> 13:46.868
[sighs] A long time.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.953
You got that right.

13:51.414 --> 13:52.540
What?

13:52.624 --> 13:55.627
You sure that Padawan died when he fell?

13:56.127 --> 13:58.129
Sure I'm sure. Why?

13:58.630 --> 14:03.176
Well, usually when someone falls
you look down, not across.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.720
Well, some of us don't like to watch.

14:15.939 --> 14:19.275
[V-wing pilot] <i>Unidentified transport,</i>
<i>transmit your clearance code.</i>

14:19.359 --> 14:22.278
Clearance code?
Don't they know who we are?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.988
Must be a protocol drill.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.159
[thunderclap, thunder rumbling]

14:28.243 --> 14:29.744
Transmitting clearance code.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.832

<i>Proceed to landing bay one-tac-one.</i>

<i>Level five lockdown remains in effect...</i>

15:11.661 --> 15:13.663
Shock troopers?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.915
What's the Coruscant Guard doing here?

15:16.499 --> 15:19.252
[PA announcer]
<i>Level five lockdown remains in effect.</i>

15:19.336 --> 15:22.339
<i>Security teams,</i>
<i>report to the command center.</i>

15:22.422 --> 15:24.215
This isn't a drill.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.968
Oh, man. What did we miss now?

15:27.677 --> 15:28.928
The end of the war.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.889
Say again, Trooper.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.933
General Grievous was defeated on Utapau.

15:34.017 --> 15:37.354
The Separatist leadership has collapsed.
The war is over.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.647
-Just like I said.
-[Wrecker gasps]

15:39.731 --> 15:41.983
It is just like you said.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.290
Is there a problem?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.751
No problem.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.796
We'll just head to our barracks then.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.217
Best hurry. There's a mandatory
general assembly at 1500.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.978
It's not just the clones on Kaller.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.189
All the regs are acting strange.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.649
Let's test that theory.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.318
Excuse me, Trooper.
What division are you from?

16:25.402 --> 16:26.403
Step aside.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.823
Oh. Well, they seem the same to me.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.956
[Wrecker] Ah!

16:38.039 --> 16:39.708
Good to be back.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.459
The smell's getting worse.

16:41.543 --> 16:44.212
You're still new. You'll get used to it.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.047
[Crosshair] Speak for yourself.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.508
Well, I'll get the board.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.893
Eleven more successful missions.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.646
[chuckles] Like there was any doubt.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.606
Kaller wasn't a win.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.444
Says who? We completed our objective.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.904
Not every objective.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.368
Hunter let that Jedi kid escape.

17:15.452 --> 17:18.329
Or do you want to keep lying to us?

17:19.789 --> 17:24.794
I don't like to think of executing
our commanders as a mission objective.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.464
An order is an order.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.549
Since when?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.262
None of this makes sense.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.640
Those clones served
alongside General Billaba for years.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.060
How could they turn on her like that?

17:40.143 --> 17:41.686
Because of the regs programming.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.439
What programming?

17:44.522 --> 17:47.150
It's been well documented
that the Kaminoans

17:47.233 --> 17:49.527
inhibited the cognitive functions
of clones

17:49.611 --> 17:52.864
to engineer them to follow orders
without question.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.991
Ha! We sure don't.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.118
Obviously, we are different.

17:57.202 --> 18:00.580
They manipulated preexisting aberrations
in our DNA,

18:00.663 --> 18:04.626
resulting in your brute strength,
Crosshair's sharpshooting skills,

18:04.709 --> 18:08.463
Hunter's enhanced senses
and my exceptional mind.

18:09.047 --> 18:12.425
My guess is we are immune
to the effects of the programming.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.928
Though I can't be 100% certain of it.

18:15.804 --> 18:19.599
What about Echo?
He was a reg before he joined us.

18:19.683 --> 18:24.521
Yeah, if all regs were programmed,
why didn't I react like the others?

18:25.105 --> 18:27.190
The damage you sustained on Skako Minor

18:27.273 --> 18:31.027
most likely wiped out all
of your preset behavioral modifications.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.782
You are more machine than man...
percentagewise, at least.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.451
[sighs] Lucky me.

18:39.202 --> 18:41.037
[PA announcer]
<i>All personnel report to the staging area</i>

18:41.121 --> 18:43.581
<i>for a briefing</i>
<i>on the state of the Republic.</i>

18:44.165 --> 18:47.210
This is one meeting I don't want to miss.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.379
First time for everything.

18:52.132 --> 18:57.137
[Palpatine]
<i>And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.</i>

18:58.138 --> 19:03.893
<i>The remaining Jedi</i>
<i>will be hunted down and defeated.</i>

19:05.186 --> 19:07.897
<i>The attempt on my life</i>

19:07.981 --> 19:12.485
<i>has left me scarred and deformed.</i>

19:12.569 --> 19:14.237
You can say that again.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.740
<i>But I assure you.</i>

19:16.823 --> 19:22.078
<i>My resolve has never been stronger!</i>

19:23.455 --> 19:27.417
<i>In order to ensure the security</i>
<i>and continuing stability...</i>

19:27.500 --> 19:28.668
What is it?

19:29.836 --> 19:33.506
<i>...the Republic will be reorganized...</i>

19:33.590 --> 19:35.675
-<i>...into the first...</i>
-Nothing.

19:35.759 --> 19:39.095
<i>...Galactic Empire!</i>

19:39.179 --> 19:41.848
Galactic Empire?

19:41.931 --> 19:47.729
<i>For a safe and secure society.</i>

19:47.812 --> 19:50.899
-[cheering, shouting]
-Yeah!

19:51.858 --> 19:54.444
Still don't think the regs are programmed?

20:02.911 --> 20:04.746
[thunder rumbling]

20:09.834 --> 20:13.880
Galactic Empire?
We're soldiers of the Republic.

20:13.963 --> 20:18.426
Republic, Empire... What's the difference?

20:18.510 --> 20:23.431
The systematic termination of the Jedi
is a big one for me.

20:23.515 --> 20:26.142
Lads, we've got company.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.104
Hello.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.439
What's that?

20:32.649 --> 20:36.986
Adolescent human female.
Origins... uncertain.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.032
My name's Omega. I was wondering
when you guys would come back.

20:41.616 --> 20:44.452
You know who we are?

20:44.536 --> 20:48.957
Hunter, Echo, Tech, Wrecker and Crosshair.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.209
You're Clone Force 99.

20:52.002 --> 20:54.045
What are you doing on Kamino, kid?

20:54.671 --> 20:56.881
Her job, of course.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.011
She is my medical assistant,

21:01.094 --> 21:04.764
one with a curious mind
that causes her to wander.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.393
Come, Omega. There is work to do.

21:17.986 --> 21:21.740
This day keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

21:55.857 --> 22:00.362
Admiral Tarkin,
this news is most surprising.

22:00.945 --> 22:06.326
Chancellor Palpatine has always supported
our cloning advancements in the past.

22:06.409 --> 22:10.580
Emperor Palpatine's priorities
have changed.

22:10.663 --> 22:14.918
With the war at an end, the need
for future clones is being questioned.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.505
Our contracts stipulate
the continued production.

22:18.588 --> 22:22.050
Your contracts were with the Republic,
which no longer exists.

22:22.133 --> 22:27.138
Surely you realize the precarious state
this newly formed Empire is in.

22:27.639 --> 22:31.810
Clone troopers will be needed
to maintain order throughout the galaxy.

22:32.477 --> 22:36.940
Indeed. A service conscription soldiers
could provide at half the cost.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.984
The skill level and efficiency
of our clones

22:40.068 --> 22:44.155
is far superior to that
of any recruited body.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.367
I shall be the judge of that,
Prime Minister.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.217
His shuttle arrived earlier today.

23:04.759 --> 23:07.679
I heard he's evaluating all the clones.

23:07.762 --> 23:11.182
Good. It's about time some of the fat
got trimmed around here.

23:17.313 --> 23:21.401
Clones being programmed.
Nothing controls me.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.029
Wrecker, it is a logical conclusion

23:24.112 --> 23:27.115
that your affinity for destruction
would stem from your conditioning.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.284
You take that back!

23:29.367 --> 23:33.747
I am merely stating a scientific
hypothesis based on factual data.

23:33.830 --> 23:36.249
Well, I got a fact for you.

23:36.332 --> 23:41.254
I like to blow things up
because I like to blow things up!

23:41.755 --> 23:42.922
Got it?

23:43.006 --> 23:45.842
Well, I'm convinced.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.845
An Imperial's been sent
to evaluate the clones.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.805
Everybody's talking about it.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.891
What kind of evaluation?

23:52.974 --> 23:56.644
Hopefully not mental.
Clearly we'd never pass that.

23:58.521 --> 23:59.606
Hello again.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.947
Omega. From earlier?

24:10.200 --> 24:11.993
In the corridor?

24:12.077 --> 24:14.579
Yeah, kid. We remember.

24:14.662 --> 24:17.499
Don't you have someplace to be?

24:18.333 --> 24:19.793
No. I'll stay.

24:19.876 --> 24:23.630
You want to sit with us?
That's never happened before.

24:23.713 --> 24:25.298
Wow.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.135
I like you.
You don't fit in around here either.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.430
What are you really doing here
on Kamino, kid?

24:32.514 --> 24:35.558
Don't you have
a family somewhere? Parents?

24:35.642 --> 24:37.060
Parents?

24:37.143 --> 24:42.190
Check it out. The defect squad's
got themselves a new recruit.

24:42.273 --> 24:43.400
[chuckles]

24:43.483 --> 24:46.653
Another member added to the Sad Batch.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.822
[clone troopers laughing]

24:48.905 --> 24:49.906
What the--

24:51.157 --> 24:52.283
Who threw that?

24:53.451 --> 24:57.288
I did. Now apologize to my friends.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.582
I like this kid!

25:00.166 --> 25:01.876
What did you say to me?

25:01.960 --> 25:04.337
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back off.

25:04.421 --> 25:07.257
I suggest you keep moving.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.181
[scoffs]

25:15.265 --> 25:17.475
Know your place, lab scrabber.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.024
[grunts]

25:25.900 --> 25:26.985
Oops.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.570
That's it.

25:28.653 --> 25:29.821
Oh, yeah!

25:30.739 --> 25:32.532
[clone troopers shouting]

25:32.615 --> 25:34.576
Oh, not again.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.521
Echo, watch out.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.984
[Echo groaning]

26:08.068 --> 26:11.446
[AZI-3] But mistress Nala Se summoned you
to the sub-level medical wing.

26:11.529 --> 26:13.448
-You must go.
-[Omega] No.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.617
I'm staying here until he wakes up.

26:16.159 --> 26:18.370
Whe-- Where?

26:19.662 --> 26:22.624
[grunting, groaning]

26:25.418 --> 26:27.337
No! Get them off!

26:28.129 --> 26:30.006
But my tests are not yet complete.

26:30.090 --> 26:34.135
Echo. Echo, it's-- It's okay.
It's me. Omega.

26:34.844 --> 26:36.262
I understand.

26:36.346 --> 26:38.807
I don't like being hooked up
to their machines either.

26:39.933 --> 26:42.268
Hello, CT-1409.

26:42.352 --> 26:44.020
His name is Echo.

26:44.104 --> 26:51.027
I am AZI-345211896246498721347,

26:51.111 --> 26:52.821
your assigned medical droid.

26:52.904 --> 26:55.198
Ha! Told you he's alive!

26:55.281 --> 26:57.450
You owe me two credits.

26:57.534 --> 27:00.286
CT-1409's condition is stable.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.997
But I have some distressing news
for the rest of you.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.291
According to your test results,

27:05.375 --> 27:09.295
you all appear to be
genetically defective clones.

27:13.925 --> 27:16.678
I will leave you
to process the shock of this revelation.

27:18.179 --> 27:19.472
We've got a problem.

27:19.556 --> 27:22.350
Not really. We're more deviant
than we are defective.

27:22.434 --> 27:26.062
Not that. Admiral Tarkin's here.

27:26.146 --> 27:28.398
He's the one evaluating the clones.

27:28.481 --> 27:32.193
The same Tarkin
from the Citadel rescue when you, uh...

27:32.277 --> 27:34.696
-How shall I put this?
-Blew up.

27:34.779 --> 27:36.698
And turned into that.

27:36.781 --> 27:38.575
[sighs] Yes.

27:39.409 --> 27:41.995
And he's not a big supporter of clones.

27:42.078 --> 27:46.124
We'll soon find out. We've been
summoned by the prime minister.

27:46.207 --> 27:50.795
Guess he didn't find that mess hall fight
amusing. But I sure did.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.298
Come on. Let's get this over with.

27:57.469 --> 27:58.470
Wait.

27:58.553 --> 28:01.931
The fight was my fault. I'm going too.

28:02.015 --> 28:05.060
Not happening. We'll handle this.

28:05.143 --> 28:06.394
-But I--
-Listen, kid.

28:06.478 --> 28:08.480
Our squad's nothing but trouble.

28:08.563 --> 28:11.107
For your sake, keep your distance.

28:11.191 --> 28:12.359
Got it?

28:23.411 --> 28:26.831
Where do you think you're going?
The training facility is that way.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.084
Training facility?

28:29.167 --> 28:31.169
For a battle simulation.

28:31.252 --> 28:34.464
Admiral Tarkin has requested
to see more of your squad in action.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.675
Then we are not being reprimanded?

28:37.258 --> 28:39.344
No, you're being tested.

28:39.427 --> 28:40.595
Now, go gear up.

28:41.346 --> 28:45.684
So, we're not in trouble,
and they want us to fight more?

28:46.309 --> 28:50.188
Ha! Maybe this Empire thing's
not so bad after all.

29:02.575 --> 29:06.621
The value of all clone troopers
is being challenged by the Empire.

29:06.705 --> 29:11.251
To demonstrate your effectiveness,
a combat-proficiency test is in order.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.211
Take your positions.

29:13.294 --> 29:17.007
We've done these a thousand times, boys.
You know what to do.

29:17.507 --> 29:21.511
A battle simulation?
Give us a real challenge.

29:23.430 --> 29:25.223
You may begin.

29:25.306 --> 29:28.393
-[beeping]
-[whirring]

29:43.616 --> 29:44.868
Crosshair, take the towers.

30:13.605 --> 30:14.689
Move in.

30:14.773 --> 30:16.316
[Wrecker] Finally!

30:18.902 --> 30:19.903
I'll cover you.

30:31.039 --> 30:33.041
This is taking way too long!

30:33.583 --> 30:35.794
[shouts]

30:42.550 --> 30:45.387
Huh? Huh? [laughing]

30:48.598 --> 30:51.685
What else ya got? Gimme more!

30:52.435 --> 30:56.773
If the Galactic Empire is to be stronger
than the Republic which preceded it,

30:56.856 --> 30:59.025
it's soldiers must follow suit.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.111
Switch to live fire.

31:01.194 --> 31:04.239
Admiral Tarkin, I must protest.

31:04.322 --> 31:09.202
Live rounds could damage my clones
and my facility.

31:09.285 --> 31:12.747
For which you will be fairly compensated.
Do it!

31:25.301 --> 31:27.846
[Wrecker laughs]

31:27.929 --> 31:31.057
New toys. Now we're talking.

31:34.894 --> 31:35.979
Yeah!

31:37.147 --> 31:38.356
Huh?

31:43.028 --> 31:44.070
[groans]

31:45.196 --> 31:46.406
They're using live rounds.

31:46.489 --> 31:47.907
Get Wrecker. We'll cover you.

31:56.458 --> 31:57.917
Wrecker, are you all right?

31:58.001 --> 32:00.170
[groans] I felt that one.

32:23.318 --> 32:24.319
[Hunter] Fall back.

32:32.285 --> 32:33.620
[Crosshair] This is going well.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.247
[Echo] These training blasters
are useless on them.

32:36.331 --> 32:38.166
[Hunter] Then we improvise.

32:38.249 --> 32:41.419
If Tarkin wants to test us,
let's not disappoint him.

32:42.462 --> 32:43.463
[whistles]

32:49.010 --> 32:51.638
Oh! I hate hand signals.

32:51.721 --> 32:53.473
Perhaps if you memorized them.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.141
Why don't you memorize them?

32:55.225 --> 32:56.226
I have.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.605
What we did on Felucia.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.816
Well, why didn't you just say that?

33:15.328 --> 33:16.329
Incoming.

33:29.342 --> 33:31.970
Reprogramming this thing
will be pointless if you crush it.

33:32.637 --> 33:34.389
You better be right about this.

33:40.603 --> 33:42.981
These are rather unusual tactics.

33:43.565 --> 33:46.192
The clones of experimental Unit 99

33:46.276 --> 33:50.196
have a tendency to veer
from standard combat protocol.

33:53.992 --> 33:56.119
[grunting]

33:56.202 --> 33:57.203
Hurry up.

33:57.829 --> 33:59.205
Done. Let him go.

33:59.289 --> 34:00.874
[device beeping]

34:29.611 --> 34:31.321
[grunting]

34:31.404 --> 34:32.947
-Wrecker. Look alive.
-Huh?

34:36.451 --> 34:37.952
Stay down!

34:39.245 --> 34:41.081
I can't sustain the connection.

34:46.795 --> 34:48.338
-[groans]
-Tech!

34:55.929 --> 34:57.347
Crosshair, we need more cover fire.

35:04.729 --> 35:06.648
[Wrecker] Tech! Hold tight, buddy.

35:06.731 --> 35:09.442
I'm not going anywhere.

35:13.238 --> 35:14.322
Wrecker, knife.

35:21.913 --> 35:24.082
[powers down]

35:25.000 --> 35:26.459
Wow.

35:31.673 --> 35:32.674
Nice work.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.827
[Nala] Extraordinary, aren't they?

36:01.327 --> 36:05.999
That remains to be seen.
Tell me about Clone Force 99.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.960
They are medically defective clones

36:09.044 --> 36:14.049
whose cellular mutations
enhanced traits desirable in a soldier.

36:15.675 --> 36:19.346
How many of these enhanced clones
do you possess?

36:20.138 --> 36:22.349
Five are all that remain.

36:23.099 --> 36:26.186
They could be an asset to your new Empire.

36:26.269 --> 36:30.273
Yet reports indicate they exhibit
a concerning level

36:30.357 --> 36:32.942
of disobedience and disregard for orders.

36:33.026 --> 36:35.320
A side effect of their mutation.

36:35.403 --> 36:39.616
Yet one that has never hindered
the completion of their missions.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.620
Then they executed Order 66?

36:44.662 --> 36:49.668
Since both the Jedi General and Padawan
on Kaller were eliminated,

36:49.751 --> 36:50.919
one would assume.

36:51.002 --> 36:54.589
Assume nothing.
Only the general's death is confirmed.

36:55.256 --> 36:59.761
A counter-report, filed by one
of their own, says the Padawan escaped.

37:00.428 --> 37:03.848
Let us see where the loyalty
of these clones truly lies.

37:10.647 --> 37:15.985
Live rounds? They used live rounds! On us!

37:16.069 --> 37:18.154
We were there, Wrecker. We know.

37:18.238 --> 37:19.739
I tried to warn you about Tarkin.

37:20.323 --> 37:23.076
Who's that Imperial snake think he is?

37:23.159 --> 37:27.747
Stow it, already. You got shot.
It happens all the time.

37:28.873 --> 37:31.835
There's a fundamental difference
between taking fire in battle

37:31.918 --> 37:34.170
and being used for target practice.

37:34.254 --> 37:37.382
Exactly! We're not dummy droids.

37:37.465 --> 37:38.883
That much we agree on.

37:47.726 --> 37:49.894
That was quite an impressive display.

37:50.478 --> 37:51.938
Didn't have much choice.

37:52.022 --> 37:56.943
Our new empire may have methods
which seem a bit unorthodox,

37:57.027 --> 37:58.987
but so does this squadron.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.989
Both certainly have their merits.

38:01.781 --> 38:05.160
Nala Se speaks quite highly
of her five enhanced clones.

38:05.243 --> 38:08.079
She claims you're more capable
than an army.

38:08.163 --> 38:10.790
You have a mission for us, sir?

38:11.374 --> 38:15.879
Indeed. We have tracked a group
of insurgents to the Onderon sector.

38:15.962 --> 38:17.547
They must be dealt with.

38:17.630 --> 38:19.382
What sort of insurgents?

38:19.883 --> 38:24.262
Separatist forces intent on keeping
the galaxy at war.

38:24.346 --> 38:28.892
If you neutralize this grave threat,
you will be looked upon most favorably

38:28.975 --> 38:31.728
as I assess the needs
of the Imperial Army.

38:47.494 --> 38:49.829
Find any more intel on the insurgents?

38:49.913 --> 38:53.083
Negative. Imperial files
are locked down tight.

38:53.166 --> 38:55.335
Give me time. I'll crack them.

38:55.835 --> 38:59.631
I'll say this for the Empire,
they know firepower.

38:59.714 --> 39:01.800
You should see the new armory.

39:01.883 --> 39:03.760
He actually cried.

39:03.843 --> 39:05.595
Hey, we both did.

39:06.179 --> 39:07.681
There's no room onboard for that.

39:07.764 --> 39:10.558
Yeah? Well, I'll make room.

39:10.642 --> 39:11.810
[sighs]

39:11.893 --> 39:15.105
A new mission and unlimited explosives.

39:15.188 --> 39:17.232
Things are back to normal.

39:17.315 --> 39:21.319
That's not going near my rack.
I refuse to sleep by a projectile again.

39:24.656 --> 39:25.657
[Omega] Hunter.

39:26.825 --> 39:29.077
I told you to keep your distance.

39:29.703 --> 39:31.830
I know, but I need to talk to you.

39:31.913 --> 39:34.541
All right. What is it?

39:35.750 --> 39:40.005
That Imperial officer,
I think he has it out for you.

39:40.088 --> 39:43.967
I overheard him talking to Lama Su.
He doesn't like clones.

39:44.050 --> 39:45.176
[chuckles]

39:45.260 --> 39:48.680
Ah, that's nothing new for us.
But we get the job done.

39:48.763 --> 39:50.640
I don't trust him.

39:50.724 --> 39:54.644
A mission's a mission.
It's nothing to worry about.

39:55.145 --> 39:56.980
Then let me come with you.

39:57.522 --> 40:01.026
Kid, you're not a soldier. It's dangerous.

40:01.109 --> 40:03.403
It's dangerous here too.

40:03.486 --> 40:06.614
Things aren't like before.
We need to leave Kamino.

40:06.698 --> 40:08.533
[Wrecker] Hunter, let's go!

40:09.826 --> 40:14.372
Change takes getting used to.
You'll see. Just give it time.

40:18.710 --> 40:19.711
Hunter.

40:22.255 --> 40:24.132
Um, n-never mind.

40:30.638 --> 40:32.098
Problem?

40:32.182 --> 40:35.560
Um, something about her
I can't figure out.

40:39.356 --> 40:43.693
Well, I guess kids
aren't your area of expertise.

41:03.963 --> 41:06.633
Omega. Come along.

41:06.716 --> 41:08.551
I told you to stay close.

41:38.164 --> 41:40.417
[creature roaring]

41:40.500 --> 41:41.793
[Echo] What was that?

41:41.876 --> 41:43.378
[Tech] You don't want to know.

41:43.461 --> 41:45.422
[Wrecker] Well, at least it's not a swamp.

41:45.505 --> 41:47.298
[Crosshair] Close enough.

41:47.382 --> 41:49.968
[Hunter] The Separatist encampment's
two klicks south.

41:50.051 --> 41:52.637
We'll continue on foot
and do a full perimeter scan.

41:54.556 --> 41:56.349
Covertly.

41:56.433 --> 42:00.770
Oh, come on. It's been days
since I've blown something up.

42:00.854 --> 42:03.231
Easy, Wrecker.
Your programming's kicking in.

42:03.314 --> 42:05.233
Hey, don't start with that!

42:06.317 --> 42:08.236
[grumbles]

42:09.738 --> 42:12.449
[creatures chirping, chittering]

42:12.532 --> 42:16.536
[scanner beeping]

42:26.296 --> 42:28.214
[Hunter] How many droids
are we talking about, Tech?

42:28.715 --> 42:32.552
I can't tell from this distance.
Something's blocking my scan.

42:32.635 --> 42:35.013
[Hunter] Clankers always travel in packs.

42:35.096 --> 42:37.390
Let's get a closer look
at what we're walking into.

42:59.371 --> 43:01.081
[Hunter] Tell me what you see, Tech.

43:01.164 --> 43:05.251
I'm clocking 25 heat signatures
ahead but zero droids.

43:06.086 --> 43:10.006
[Crosshair]
Tarkin said insurgents, not droids.

43:10.840 --> 43:13.218
[Echo] I'm not sure they're either.

43:14.844 --> 43:17.681
There are children down there.

43:17.764 --> 43:20.183
[Hunter] Children? Out here?

43:22.060 --> 43:23.895
Something's not right.

43:24.688 --> 43:25.980
[Crosshair] What are you waiting for?

43:26.606 --> 43:28.608
Give the order.

43:28.692 --> 43:32.028
-[Hunter] Negative. Stand down.
-What?

43:32.112 --> 43:35.031
[Wrecker]
You mean, we're not blasting any droids?

43:35.115 --> 43:36.783
[Tech] There aren't any droids, Wrecker.

43:36.866 --> 43:38.952
[Wrecker] Well, so what do we do?

43:39.035 --> 43:41.329
[Crosshair] We finish the mission.

43:41.413 --> 43:43.373
Make the call, Hunter.

43:44.624 --> 43:46.292
We're not alone.

43:46.876 --> 43:48.378
Now stand down.

43:57.262 --> 43:59.597
You heard him. Stand down.

44:00.849 --> 44:04.561
Let's hear them out. Trust me.

44:10.275 --> 44:12.277
[sighs]

44:41.389 --> 44:43.600
These aren't Separatists.

44:43.683 --> 44:45.560
They're Republic fighters.

44:46.436 --> 44:49.147
Why would Tarkin send us
to attack our own forces?

44:50.398 --> 44:53.151
Because we refuse to fight for an Empire.

44:54.152 --> 44:55.779
You're Saw Gerrera.

44:56.446 --> 45:00.450
Trained by Captain Rex and General
Skywalker to fight for the Republic.

45:12.545 --> 45:18.426
So, the newly declared empire
sent you to wipe us out?

45:19.052 --> 45:21.471
Well, we're here to neutralize
a group of insurgents.

45:21.554 --> 45:23.014
[chuckles]

45:23.098 --> 45:25.475
Well... here we are.

45:25.558 --> 45:26.935
What are you gonna do?

45:27.018 --> 45:29.646
Strike us down like you did the Jedi?

45:29.729 --> 45:31.731
Is that a request?

45:31.815 --> 45:32.857
Enough.

45:32.941 --> 45:35.944
We expected to find battle droids, not--

45:36.027 --> 45:40.532
Civilians? Times change, targets change.

45:40.615 --> 45:44.619
Why don't you take a look at
the insurgents you were sent to destroy?

45:50.375 --> 45:53.128
Makes you wonder
what else they're lying about.

45:55.296 --> 45:57.465
Let's mobilize. Pack up the camp.

46:04.347 --> 46:07.559
What's going on here?
Who are these people?

46:08.518 --> 46:12.689
Villagers, croppers,
former Republic fighters,

46:12.772 --> 46:18.945
all now displaced refugees since Palpatine
unjustly appointed himself Emperor.

46:19.529 --> 46:24.659
According to reports, the Jedi made an
attempt on the Supreme Chancellor's life.

46:24.743 --> 46:27.537
His actions were a defensive measure.

46:28.163 --> 46:29.831
And I figured you for the smart one.

46:30.582 --> 46:34.502
With the Jedi decimated
and the clone army under his command,

46:34.586 --> 46:38.381
Palpatine will have control
over the entire galaxy.

46:38.465 --> 46:40.300
Unless we stop him.

46:40.383 --> 46:43.345
The war is over.

46:43.928 --> 46:47.390
If we give up now,
everything we fought for...

46:48.391 --> 46:51.561
everyone we lost,
will have been for nothing.

46:52.395 --> 46:54.314
I won't let that happen.

46:54.397 --> 46:59.402
The Clone War may have ended,
but a civil war is about to begin.

47:00.153 --> 47:04.657
With a handful of fighters and limited
firepower? You don't stand a chance.

47:04.741 --> 47:06.451
Not alone we don't.

47:06.993 --> 47:09.287
We should leave
if we're gonna make the rendezvous.

47:09.913 --> 47:11.164
What do we do with them?

47:15.168 --> 47:20.840
The clones once helped us free Onderon,
so we'll give them a choice.

47:20.924 --> 47:23.468
The old ways are done.

47:23.551 --> 47:27.847
You can either adapt and survive,
or die with the past.

47:28.473 --> 47:29.974
The decision is yours.

48:11.850 --> 48:14.144
[droid chatter]

48:21.401 --> 48:24.320
[Tech] At least with the Republic
we knew where we stood.

48:24.988 --> 48:29.034
Tarkin and this Empire
are a whole different story.

48:29.117 --> 48:32.954
Why are we debating this?
We need to complete the mission.

48:33.455 --> 48:37.751
Wake up, Crosshair. They sent us
to eliminate innocent civilians.

48:37.834 --> 48:39.502
Who said they're innocent?

48:39.586 --> 48:40.920
What's wrong with you?

48:41.463 --> 48:43.965
Me? I'm following orders.

48:44.049 --> 48:45.967
Exactly.

48:46.051 --> 48:48.678
Those insurgents
are plotting against the Emperor.

48:49.387 --> 48:53.099
If you don't have the stomach
to do what needs to be done,

48:53.183 --> 48:56.686
then you're not fit to lead this squad.

49:01.483 --> 49:03.026
[branch snaps]

49:07.989 --> 49:09.199
We're being followed.

49:15.622 --> 49:17.415
[Tech] That is a probe droid.

49:17.499 --> 49:19.501
[Wrecker] Tarkin's spying on us now?

49:20.001 --> 49:21.586
The Jedi never did that.

49:21.670 --> 49:23.546
[Crosshair] Not that you know of.

49:26.508 --> 49:27.509
Omega.

49:28.218 --> 49:29.469
What about her?

49:30.095 --> 49:33.098
She warned me about the mission.
And Tarkin.

49:33.181 --> 49:37.769
She said not to return to Kamino,
that it's not safe for us anymore.

49:37.852 --> 49:40.438
[Wrecker grunts] Maybe she's right.

49:40.522 --> 49:43.942
We're taking the word of a child now?

49:44.442 --> 49:46.361
I would not discount Omega's insight.

49:47.195 --> 49:49.447
A state of heightened awareness
is not unusual

49:49.531 --> 49:52.200
for an enhanced clone such as herself.

49:52.283 --> 49:55.829
[laughs] Good one, Tech.
You almost had me.

49:55.912 --> 49:58.331
When Nala Se spoke of five clones,

49:58.415 --> 50:01.876
Tarkin assumed that meant us,
but Echo's a reg.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.920
The fifth is Omega.

50:04.004 --> 50:08.717
I confirmed my suspicions after analyzing
her DNA while we were in the infirmary.

50:08.800 --> 50:11.636
And you waited until now to mention it?

50:11.720 --> 50:13.680
Well, I thought it was obvious.

50:13.763 --> 50:15.765
How is it obvious?

50:16.307 --> 50:17.726
We're going back for her.

50:19.894 --> 50:23.857
Disobeying orders again over a kid?

50:23.940 --> 50:26.151
Bad play, Hunter.

50:33.283 --> 50:36.953
She's one of us.
We're not leaving her there.

50:41.583 --> 50:44.085
[engine starting]

50:49.174 --> 50:51.676
[thunder rumbling]

50:52.594 --> 50:53.887
Wow.

50:54.721 --> 50:57.307
What is all this stuff, AZI?

50:57.390 --> 51:00.518
My scanners are indicating
an assortment of armament,

51:00.602 --> 51:03.897
curios and detritus of little to no value.

51:03.980 --> 51:05.607
I like it.

51:05.690 --> 51:07.567
We should not be here, Omega.

51:07.650 --> 51:10.362
Nala Se instructed us to stay
in the medical wing.

51:10.445 --> 51:14.532
Don't worry.
We're on... a research assignment.

51:14.616 --> 51:19.079
A research assignment?
Those are my favorite.

51:19.162 --> 51:22.248
What is it we are searching for?
Is it this?

51:23.291 --> 51:24.584
[object clatters]

51:24.668 --> 51:26.419
What about this?

51:28.213 --> 51:29.214
[AZI-3] Or this?

51:31.424 --> 51:32.425
Is it this?

51:33.468 --> 51:34.469
Perhaps this?

51:36.846 --> 51:37.847
What about this?

51:48.900 --> 51:52.237
This is a curious keepsake.

51:53.196 --> 51:54.572
[screams]

51:55.573 --> 51:58.243
Shh! People will hear us.

51:58.326 --> 52:01.246
I have concluded this space
is unfit for habitation.

52:01.329 --> 52:03.331
[shock troopers chattering, faint]

52:04.833 --> 52:07.585
Someone is coming. Time to go.

52:11.715 --> 52:13.717
You're not authorized to be in here.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.844
I... got lost.

52:15.927 --> 52:17.262
Sorry. It won't happen again.

52:17.887 --> 52:20.056
Pack up their gear
and take it to the hangar.

52:20.140 --> 52:21.933
You, you're coming with me.

52:22.017 --> 52:24.561
We will not. We are official
Kaminoan medical personnel--

52:24.644 --> 52:25.895
Don't touch me, droid.

52:26.312 --> 52:27.939
-[screams]
-AZI!

52:40.618 --> 52:45.165
I'm getting no response from com-scan.
This is unusual.

52:45.248 --> 52:48.209
Bring us in.
We'll find out what's going on.

53:12.317 --> 53:15.904
[thunderclap, thunder rumbling]

53:17.906 --> 53:19.407
Stick to the plan.

53:19.491 --> 53:22.744
Split up, find Omega,
meet back here at the ship.

53:45.475 --> 53:46.476
Freeze!

53:50.689 --> 53:52.524
As expected.

53:57.737 --> 54:00.699
The Empire does not
tolerate failure, Sergeant.

54:00.782 --> 54:03.618
There were complications.

54:03.702 --> 54:06.788
Yes, the probe droid's report
was quite detailed.

54:07.414 --> 54:09.958
Conspiring with Saw Gerrera.

54:10.041 --> 54:12.752
I assume you know
the punishment for treason.

54:12.836 --> 54:14.337
Treason?

54:14.421 --> 54:16.172
Throw them in the brig.

54:33.106 --> 54:34.399
[sniffs]

54:34.482 --> 54:35.734
Smells weird.

54:35.817 --> 54:37.318
Because it's clean.

54:37.819 --> 54:39.612
Well, the plan wasn't a total failure.

54:43.074 --> 54:44.159
Goody.

54:46.036 --> 54:47.912
I warned you not to come back.

54:47.996 --> 54:50.665
Had to. We were looking for you.

54:52.167 --> 54:53.251
Me?

54:53.335 --> 54:55.003
What do you say, kid?

54:55.086 --> 54:58.423
You wanna come with us
or did we get captured for nothing?

54:58.506 --> 55:00.967
You came back for me?

55:01.051 --> 55:04.637
That's right.
Or you can stay on Kamino if--

55:04.721 --> 55:08.308
No, it's like I said before.
I want to go with you.

55:09.142 --> 55:11.478
How touching.

55:14.064 --> 55:15.231
[clears throat]

55:15.315 --> 55:18.735
Uh, Hunter,
how are we breaking outta here?

55:18.818 --> 55:20.653
I'm working on it.

55:20.737 --> 55:23.073
You know what you should work on?

55:23.156 --> 55:25.408
Explaining when you went soft.

55:25.492 --> 55:26.910
Stow it, Crosshair.

55:26.993 --> 55:30.789
Don't you see we're locked up in here
because of him?

55:30.872 --> 55:32.624
He had us disobey orders.

55:32.707 --> 55:35.835
I never thought you disobeying orders
was a problem.

55:35.919 --> 55:38.380
Yeah. We do it all the time.

55:38.463 --> 55:40.674
Good soldiers follow orders.

55:40.757 --> 55:44.094
Every choice you've made since Kaller
has been wrong.

55:44.678 --> 55:47.931
First the Padawan, then Gerrera.

55:48.014 --> 55:50.350
You're becoming a liability.

55:50.850 --> 55:52.852
We can debate my choices later.

55:52.936 --> 55:55.772
For now,
let's focus on getting outta here.

56:02.612 --> 56:04.114
[exhales]

56:07.158 --> 56:08.243
[Omega] You're angry.

56:12.497 --> 56:14.833
How perceptive.

56:15.750 --> 56:20.088
I know what you're going to do,
but please don't.

56:20.171 --> 56:22.090
What do you know?

56:22.882 --> 56:26.386
I know it's not your fault.

56:27.846 --> 56:29.097
You can't help it.

56:34.269 --> 56:36.479
CT-9904, you're coming with us.

56:36.563 --> 56:38.857
Oh, no, no, no. We stay together.

56:41.067 --> 56:41.943
Stand down!

57:13.099 --> 57:15.185
Well, what is his status?

57:15.810 --> 57:22.317
CT-9904's genetic mutations
have altered much of his cranial activity,

57:22.400 --> 57:24.444
including his inhibitor chip.

57:25.111 --> 57:29.282
Yet he exhibited loyalty to the Empire
during their mission.

57:29.366 --> 57:33.370
While the chip is not as active
as a standard clone's,

57:33.453 --> 57:35.997
the order does appear to be working.

57:36.081 --> 57:39.459
Can you intensify the programming?

57:39.542 --> 57:40.710
Yes.

57:40.794 --> 57:42.212
Then proceed.

57:44.464 --> 57:47.676
[whirring]

57:52.555 --> 57:56.017
[beeping]

58:24.295 --> 58:27.215
I've got it.
Why didn't I think of it before?

58:27.298 --> 58:29.134
This is not a prison.

58:29.217 --> 58:30.969
Yeah, well, I beg to differ.

58:31.052 --> 58:35.056
This is a Kaminoan facility.
It was built prior to the Clone Wars.

58:35.140 --> 58:37.726
There were no barracks or prisons
when it was constructed.

58:38.393 --> 58:39.978
Well, how does that help us?

58:40.061 --> 58:44.315
Because while these cells were
retrofitted to hold normal individuals,

58:44.399 --> 58:48.403
they could not possibly account
for someone like Wrecker.

58:48.486 --> 58:51.031
Oh! You mean I could punch our way out?

58:52.157 --> 58:53.658
-Shh!
-Shh!

58:53.742 --> 58:55.326
Oh. Right.

58:55.410 --> 58:57.620
[whispers]
You mean I could punch our way out?

58:57.704 --> 58:59.998
If you punch the correct spot.

59:00.081 --> 59:01.666
Right. Show me where.

59:02.250 --> 59:06.254
If this is gonna work,
we'll need some cover. Form a wall.

59:17.307 --> 59:19.142
Hit this. Here.

59:20.435 --> 59:21.436
Right.

59:27.067 --> 59:28.485
Tell me when.

59:29.694 --> 59:30.528
Now.

59:37.035 --> 59:38.661
[grumbles]

59:38.745 --> 59:39.913
Nothing happened.

59:40.538 --> 59:42.290
Are you sure this is gonna work?

59:42.374 --> 59:44.626
Try it again. A little harder.

59:45.794 --> 59:48.004
You're all clear. Make it count.

59:48.088 --> 59:49.381
Okay.

59:58.264 --> 59:59.933
[chattering, faint]

1:00:00.016 --> 1:00:01.976
Oh, it still didn't work.

1:00:07.315 --> 1:00:09.025
Oh, yes, it did.

1:00:09.109 --> 1:00:10.193
Look.

1:00:12.445 --> 1:00:14.781
I'll never fit through that.

1:00:14.864 --> 1:00:18.785
Astute as always, Wrecker,
but I was actually going to suggest--

1:00:18.868 --> 1:00:19.869
I'll do it.

1:00:20.787 --> 1:00:22.038
You sure, kid?

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:23.748
I'm sure.

1:00:24.582 --> 1:00:29.295
Okay. Get to the console
and hit the lever to lower the ray shield.

1:00:35.635 --> 1:00:36.803
Incoming.

1:00:39.639 --> 1:00:41.599
Wait, where's the girl?

1:00:41.683 --> 1:00:43.184
You tell us.

1:00:43.268 --> 1:00:45.353
Harm her and you're a dead man.

1:00:45.437 --> 1:00:48.523
Operations, we need a status report
on prisoner 0219.

1:00:51.359 --> 1:00:52.527
[clank]

1:00:52.610 --> 1:00:53.653
What was that?

1:00:53.737 --> 1:00:54.738
Sorry.

1:00:54.821 --> 1:00:58.533
These floors don't hold me so well
on account of them

1:00:58.616 --> 1:01:03.038
not being designed
for abnormal individuals such as myself.

1:01:03.747 --> 1:01:05.498
What's behind you?

1:01:05.582 --> 1:01:07.083
Nothing.

1:01:07.167 --> 1:01:09.210
Move away from the wall. Now.

1:01:09.294 --> 1:01:11.129
Why don't you come here and make me?

1:01:11.212 --> 1:01:12.589
[comm beeps]

1:01:12.672 --> 1:01:15.508
Copy that.
The girl's still registered in lockdown.

1:01:15.592 --> 1:01:17.010
Tell us where she is.

1:01:20.472 --> 1:01:21.473
Hit the switch, Omega!

1:01:25.894 --> 1:01:27.395
Ah! [grunts]

1:01:27.479 --> 1:01:28.480
Get off!

1:01:29.731 --> 1:01:30.732
Hey, Red.

1:01:39.741 --> 1:01:41.493
Ha! Not bad.

1:01:43.453 --> 1:01:47.040
We need to find out
where they took Crosshair. Let's move.

1:02:10.271 --> 1:02:13.316
[sighs] We're not going to get very far
without our gear.

1:02:14.067 --> 1:02:17.696
They started moving all your things to
the hangar. Your gear might be there too.

1:02:18.822 --> 1:02:19.823
This way.

1:02:33.795 --> 1:02:37.340
All right, boys, suit up.
Let's make this quick.

1:02:40.343 --> 1:02:45.140
Right. No. No! Where is it? Where is it?

1:02:45.223 --> 1:02:46.641
[grunting]

1:02:46.725 --> 1:02:48.226
It's gotta be here somewhere.

1:02:53.648 --> 1:02:57.068
Tech, power up the ship.
The rest of us will go after Crosshair.

1:03:09.497 --> 1:03:11.750
I don't think we'll have to go far.

1:03:18.381 --> 1:03:20.800
Is that Crosshair?

1:03:34.856 --> 1:03:37.025
Best stand down, Sergeant.

1:03:37.609 --> 1:03:39.444
Make it easy on yourself.

1:03:39.527 --> 1:03:40.904
Have you lost your mind?

1:03:41.905 --> 1:03:44.407
We should've killed that Jedi.

1:03:44.491 --> 1:03:47.494
You disobeyed orders.

1:03:48.244 --> 1:03:50.288
I did what I thought was right.

1:03:50.372 --> 1:03:52.957
You never could see the bigger picture.

1:03:53.708 --> 1:03:54.918
Now surrender.

1:04:01.299 --> 1:04:02.717
Is that an order?

1:04:03.510 --> 1:04:04.719
Heh.

1:04:05.470 --> 1:04:07.305
I guess it is.

1:04:08.348 --> 1:04:12.310
Well, I guess I'm disobeying that one too.

1:04:18.191 --> 1:04:19.192
[spits]

1:04:25.949 --> 1:04:28.368
[thunderclap, thunder rumbling]

1:04:59.065 --> 1:05:00.775
Tech, we gotta move. Now!

1:05:00.859 --> 1:05:01.776
I'm working on it.

1:05:02.402 --> 1:05:04.029
Wrecker, clear the smoke on three.

1:05:04.112 --> 1:05:05.613
You got it, boss.

1:05:06.740 --> 1:05:08.116
Omega, stay low.

1:05:09.534 --> 1:05:13.121
One... two...

1:05:13.747 --> 1:05:15.081
Three!

1:05:23.923 --> 1:05:25.508
[groans]

1:05:27.635 --> 1:05:28.762
[Hunter] Omega, don't!

1:05:29.846 --> 1:05:31.306
He's using Wrecker as bait.

1:05:31.389 --> 1:05:32.807
But he needs help.

1:05:33.266 --> 1:05:35.727
-Tech, we're out of time.
-Almost got it.

1:05:41.858 --> 1:05:43.068
Seal the bay doors!

1:05:45.612 --> 1:05:46.613
[beeps]

1:05:46.696 --> 1:05:49.491
[metal clunking]

1:05:49.574 --> 1:05:50.533
[alarm blaring]

1:05:53.495 --> 1:05:56.998
-[blaring continues]
-Sir, someone's overriding the controls.

1:06:01.795 --> 1:06:05.215
When I say "go," you head for that ramp
and don't stop. Got it?

1:06:06.341 --> 1:06:07.509
Echo, we go for Wrecker.

1:06:09.886 --> 1:06:12.055
[Crosshair] Only one way out, Hunter.

1:06:12.138 --> 1:06:14.349
Your move.

1:06:15.058 --> 1:06:16.226
Go!

1:07:04.607 --> 1:07:05.608
[beeps]

1:07:15.201 --> 1:07:18.121
Has the matter been rectified?

1:07:18.204 --> 1:07:21.875
The inhibitor chip augmentation
was a success.

1:07:21.958 --> 1:07:27.714
However, the remaining clones
of squad 99 have escaped,

1:07:28.465 --> 1:07:30.467
along with Omega.

1:07:31.217 --> 1:07:34.429
Mmm. We must be cautious.

1:07:34.512 --> 1:07:39.517
Until the Empire's intentions
are made clear, say nothing.

1:07:40.185 --> 1:07:42.437
Yes, Prime Minister.

1:07:59.746 --> 1:08:01.081
Ouch!

1:08:01.164 --> 1:08:04.084
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. What's that gonna do?

1:08:04.167 --> 1:08:06.169
You'll be okay. Just hold still.

1:08:07.295 --> 1:08:09.339
[Omega] Is this what you were looking for?

1:08:09.422 --> 1:08:10.632
[gasps]

1:08:10.715 --> 1:08:12.342
You found my Lula!

1:08:12.425 --> 1:08:14.344
-Ow!
-[giggling]

1:08:15.470 --> 1:08:16.596
[scanner beeps]

1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:19.349
Let's see here. Hold still.

1:08:19.432 --> 1:08:22.018
Don't examine me. I'm not a computer.

1:08:22.102 --> 1:08:23.895
-This will take just a second.
-[beeping]

1:08:23.978 --> 1:08:26.398
Get that thing away from me. [grunts]

1:08:47.085 --> 1:08:49.337
Your first time in space?

1:08:50.672 --> 1:08:53.508
First time anywhere.

1:08:56.553 --> 1:08:59.222
Impressive shot back there.

1:08:59.305 --> 1:09:01.057
Where'd you learn to do that?

1:09:01.683 --> 1:09:03.143
I don't know.

1:09:03.226 --> 1:09:05.812
I never fired a blaster before.

1:09:05.895 --> 1:09:06.980
I guess I got lucky.

1:09:07.063 --> 1:09:08.940
She's not the only one.

1:09:09.024 --> 1:09:10.442
I'm fine.

1:09:10.525 --> 1:09:13.778
It'll take more than a blaster shot
to take me down. [chuckles]

1:09:13.862 --> 1:09:15.280
You were down.

1:09:15.363 --> 1:09:17.866
Yeah, well, not for long. [laughs]

1:09:17.949 --> 1:09:19.242
[groans]

1:09:19.325 --> 1:09:21.077
What's the plan, Hunter?

1:09:21.161 --> 1:09:24.998
I thought we could go off
on our own. Lay low.

1:09:25.582 --> 1:09:29.377
But with Crosshair gunning for us,
I'm not so sure.

1:09:29.461 --> 1:09:32.505
What about your friends?
Could any of them help us?

1:09:32.589 --> 1:09:34.883
That would be a short list.

1:09:36.426 --> 1:09:38.345
I can think of one.

1:09:38.428 --> 1:09:40.930
Plot a course for J-19.

1:09:41.014 --> 1:09:42.098
J-19?

1:09:42.766 --> 1:09:44.267
We know a guy.

1:09:44.351 --> 1:09:46.603
[laughs] Yeah!

1:09:47.645 --> 1:09:51.149
Strap in, kid.
You're not gonna wanna miss this view.

1:09:59.115 --> 1:10:02.035
[beeping]
