02:12.291 --> 02:14.500
-You lose. You lose!
-You cheated!

02:14.583 --> 02:15.416
No!

02:37.666 --> 02:41.041
By the way, it's not a dinner.
It's your surprise birthday party.

02:41.833 --> 02:44.458
-I hate you.
-Just don't ruin it for them.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.958
Surprise!

03:04.625 --> 03:06.291
Why aren't you surprised?

03:06.375 --> 03:08.833
Seems like you knew, little one.

03:08.916 --> 03:10.791
No, of course not. How could I know?

03:11.875 --> 03:13.750
Happy birthday, darling.

03:13.833 --> 03:14.833
Thanks, Mama.

03:15.916 --> 03:18.458
Now go to your room
and change your clothes.

03:18.541 --> 03:21.625
OK, everyone, let's eat. Help yourselves.

03:37.041 --> 03:39.791
<i>The Syrian revolution is starting.</i>

03:40.750 --> 03:42.500
<i>People all on the streets,</i>

03:42.583 --> 03:46.833
<i>demanding the removal</i>
<i>of President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus.</i>

03:47.666 --> 03:49.666
<i>We are together, Sunnis and Alawites…</i>

03:49.750 --> 03:52.166
Sara, what are you doing?
Come dance with us.

03:52.250 --> 03:55.125
-In a minute.
-What are you watching?

03:55.208 --> 03:57.375
<i>A group of Syrian women</i>
<i>are shouting…</i>

03:57.458 --> 03:59.625
I told you
not to watch these things.

03:59.708 --> 04:00.916
This is reality, Mama.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.333
What happened in Tunisia,
Egypt, and Libya is happening here.

04:03.416 --> 04:05.916
And I've told you
nothing like that can happen in Syria.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.500
<i>The anger is building--</i>

04:07.583 --> 04:09.083
<i>Yalla, </i>darling.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.791
The party's boring.
I don't want to.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.791
Come on, for your sister's sake.

04:19.208 --> 04:20.833
Uncle, come on.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.333
Everyone say "cheese."

04:22.416 --> 04:25.333
Cheese!

04:27.333 --> 04:31.000
I thank God day and night
for blessing me with three daughters,

04:31.083 --> 04:33.416
stronger than a thousand sons.

04:34.375 --> 04:39.791
But don't forget how lucky these girls are
that I'm their dad

04:40.541 --> 04:41.583
and their coach.

04:41.666 --> 04:43.291
Here he goes.

04:44.708 --> 04:48.291
Two weeks ago, at the qualifying meet
for the National Championships,

04:48.375 --> 04:53.583
Yusra improved her personal best
in the 100m butterfly.

04:55.541 --> 04:56.916
Congrats, Yusra.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.750
But Sara won her heat too.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.541
Yeah, Sara is headstrong
and a leader like me.

05:03.625 --> 05:09.166
But Yusra has discipline,
strength, and perseverance.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.750
She is my powerhouse.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.250
What about me?

05:12.333 --> 05:15.416
And you, Shahed, Daddy's darling,

05:15.500 --> 05:17.875
are my little warrior.

05:18.875 --> 05:22.583
Dear guests,
I will be the first father in history

05:22.666 --> 05:26.000
to have three daughters
swimming in the Olympics.

05:41.958 --> 05:45.416
-Isn't that your cousin?
-Nizar.

05:47.416 --> 05:50.083
Nizar!

05:52.375 --> 05:53.875
-How you doing?
-Good.

05:53.958 --> 05:55.125
Play a song for us.

05:55.208 --> 05:57.083
-What?
-Play a song for us.

05:57.166 --> 05:59.625
-What's it worth?
-I'll buy you a shot.

06:04.958 --> 06:06.166
For you guys.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.583
Go, Sara, go! Kick his ass!

07:19.666 --> 07:21.500
Show me, then.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.916
No, you can't do that.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.708
No, I swear you can't do that.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.833
It's late. We should go home.

07:31.916 --> 07:32.750
Why?

07:32.833 --> 07:34.583
We have to be
at the pool at six.

07:34.666 --> 07:37.458
Do you seriously think
there's any point in training anymore?

07:37.541 --> 07:40.916
-If I want to make the Olympics.
-The Olympics?

07:42.500 --> 07:44.083
Swimming for who?

07:44.166 --> 07:46.250
There's no country left anymore.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.541
Syria's gone! Bah. Haven't you noticed?

07:50.625 --> 07:51.958
It is still early.

07:55.583 --> 07:56.666
What?

07:58.458 --> 08:01.083
-What?
-Razan Haddad is dead.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.333
In a bombing.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.625
It's all over Facebook.

08:07.833 --> 08:08.916
My God…

08:09.000 --> 08:11.041
I just saw her.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.958
You see?
All the more reason to go home.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.208
All the more reason to party.

08:44.125 --> 08:47.083
Sara, be careful. Get back in.

08:50.750 --> 08:54.166
You're so annoying.
Hala, you can help me, you know.

08:58.583 --> 09:03.500
Razan Haddad!
We'll never forget you!

09:09.041 --> 09:10.000
Bye!

09:14.791 --> 09:16.000
Hey, beautiful.

09:16.791 --> 09:17.958
What's up, ladies?

09:18.041 --> 09:21.458
Come have a drink with us.
Unless you don't like the look of me?

09:21.541 --> 09:23.541
Aren't we good enough for you?

09:26.500 --> 09:28.750
I hate living
in this neighborhood.

09:29.708 --> 09:31.958
-Where have you been?

09:33.375 --> 09:35.333
Aren't you out a little late tonight?

09:50.250 --> 09:52.875
Sara, shush, be careful.

09:52.958 --> 09:55.083
Give me the keys.

09:55.166 --> 09:57.208
-You'll wake Baba and Mama.
-Shh.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.250
Lulu.

10:10.708 --> 10:11.958
How are you, darling?

10:18.458 --> 10:21.458
-Don't be frightened.

10:22.666 --> 10:23.875
Good night, my love.

10:27.041 --> 10:28.000
Shh.

10:28.958 --> 10:30.708
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

10:30.791 --> 10:33.916
Do you know what your dad
would do if he knew?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.083
Sorry.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.208
Did you hear about
Razan Haddad?

10:46.500 --> 10:47.791
I heard.

10:50.791 --> 10:54.708
God bless her soul
and give her mother strength.

11:05.791 --> 11:09.708
<i>Yalla,</i> darling. Time to sleep.
You have training in the morning.

11:25.625 --> 11:26.875
What was my time?

11:26.958 --> 11:28.125
You're tired.

11:28.208 --> 11:29.750
What was my time, Baba?

11:30.791 --> 11:33.083
Coach. I'll see you at home.

11:39.958 --> 11:42.125
<i> And it's Michael Phelps</i>
<i>here in the 100m fly,</i>

11:42.208 --> 11:46.000
<i>going for his seventh gold medal</i>
<i>of these Games. Phelps in lane five.</i>

11:48.333 --> 11:51.291
You see?
It's all arm propulsion, not the kick.

11:51.375 --> 11:53.458
<i>…about 24 flat at the first turn.</i>

11:53.541 --> 11:54.875
<i>Čavić is gonna…</i>

11:54.958 --> 11:57.916
You know he went to Sydney when he was 15?

11:59.166 --> 12:00.708
<i>But here comes Phelps!</i>

12:01.416 --> 12:04.666
The youngest American swimmer
to compete at the Olympics.

12:05.666 --> 12:08.916
<i>He gets it done!</i>
<i>A new Olympic record.</i>

12:09.000 --> 12:13.541
You aren't a true athlete
unless your dream is the Olympics.

12:15.458 --> 12:18.958
You're not going to represent us
at the Nationals this time.

12:19.041 --> 12:22.208
Yusra and Arwa got better times than you.

12:24.166 --> 12:28.458
<i>Everything going perfectly</i>
<i>for Michael Phelps here in Beijing.</i>

12:29.458 --> 12:32.375
-Hala left for Germany.
-What?

12:32.458 --> 12:35.458
-She went alone without her family.
-Why didn't she tell us?

12:35.541 --> 12:38.250
She's gonna apply
for this family reunion thing.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.625
When younger than 18, you have to write
for your family to join you.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.541
Can't believe she didn't tell us.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.791
-You're disgusting.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.750
I'm gonna post it!

13:04.833 --> 13:07.291
No, actually,
I don't wanna lose followers.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.500
IDs.

13:16.625 --> 13:17.791
Omar?

13:17.875 --> 13:20.833
From Duma? What are you doing here?

13:22.166 --> 13:23.833
-Sara.

13:24.291 --> 13:25.625
Why are you laughing?

13:25.708 --> 13:28.625
Since when has laughing become illegal?

13:28.708 --> 13:29.625
Give me your ID.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.458
Please, she didn't mean disrespect.

13:31.541 --> 13:32.958
Shut up, you.

13:34.791 --> 13:36.375
I'm not disrespecting.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.625
Don't talk too much. Understand?

13:40.125 --> 13:41.583
Raise your arms.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.750
You'd do this to your sisters?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.291
You're not my sister.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.333
Is this your sister?

14:03.208 --> 14:04.625
Stand up.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.375
<i>Yalla.</i>

14:12.000 --> 14:13.291
Raise your arms.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.041
Sniper!

14:34.541 --> 14:35.791
Eyes up!

14:37.375 --> 14:38.875
Look up!

14:38.958 --> 14:41.250
Go. There are people on the bus.

14:56.250 --> 15:00.083
YOUR PLANES CAN'T BOMB OUR DREAMS

15:04.083 --> 15:07.416
<i>How can I let my girls</i>
<i>travel across Europe on their own?</i>

15:08.791 --> 15:11.666
What happened to
the strong daughters you raised?

15:14.291 --> 15:17.791
You know Razan Haddad is
my third friend to die this month?

15:18.958 --> 15:21.208
You know how many times
we've come close to death?

15:21.833 --> 15:25.750
We need to get Yusra to Germany
as soon as possible before she turns 18.

15:27.416 --> 15:30.208
The problem is
it's so dangerous, my love.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.166
I wish you could go on a plane.

15:32.250 --> 15:35.666
Because European countries
are just handing out visas to Syrians.

15:36.625 --> 15:41.250
Mama, it's very easy. We get to Germany
and apply for family reunion,

15:41.333 --> 15:43.708
and you can all come on a plane.
It's simple.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.750
So I let you two risk your lives,

15:45.833 --> 15:49.166
crawl through the most dangerous parts
of Europe, to get us plane tickets?

15:49.250 --> 15:52.208
Everyone's doing it. Hala did it.
She told me it's really easy…

15:53.291 --> 15:54.958
My darling, come here.

15:56.958 --> 15:59.750
-It's out in the neighborhood.
-I'm scared of the dark.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.250
Don't be scared, little one.

16:01.916 --> 16:04.250
I hope the car battery will last.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.791
<i>Yalla, </i>see? Now eat up.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.458
I wish we could go back to Darayya.

16:17.791 --> 16:21.833
-Darayya is still too dangerous.
-The whole of Syria is too dangerous.

16:21.916 --> 16:25.125
But you and your sister walking
across Europe isn't dangerous at all?

16:25.208 --> 16:27.625
Yes, but once we arrive,
we'll all be safe.

16:27.708 --> 16:29.166
That's if you arrive.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.666
And if you arrive, what will you be?

16:33.333 --> 16:34.833
Refugees?

16:34.916 --> 16:36.791
And you'll ruin your swimming careers.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.041
It's the best way.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.791
She always thinks
she has the best way.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.083
You're not going.

16:44.041 --> 16:45.416
That's the end of it.

16:46.583 --> 16:50.000
If I was the one who was 17,
you'd let me go on my own.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.666
It's your precious Yusra
you don't want to risk.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.791
Baba, about Sara…

17:11.375 --> 17:12.916
Stop thinking about her.

17:13.000 --> 17:13.958
Concentrate.

17:15.375 --> 17:18.333
In the water, you're on your own.
It's your fight.

17:18.416 --> 17:20.625
Your aim is to win.
It's not about being nice.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.625
You have a goal, and you must reach it.

17:23.708 --> 17:26.375
Focus on all the things
you have control over.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
The start.

17:28.875 --> 17:29.833
Streamline.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.333
The kick off the wall. Your breathing.

17:35.958 --> 17:38.625
Find your lane.
Swim your race.

18:07.541 --> 18:09.375
Take your marks.

18:22.625 --> 18:24.375
Yusra! Yusra!

18:36.041 --> 18:40.458
Yusra! Yusra! Yusra! Yusra! Yusra!

18:52.750 --> 18:54.625
Yusra! Yusra!

19:27.083 --> 19:28.208
Yusra!

19:55.416 --> 19:56.791
Yusra!

20:16.541 --> 20:19.333
Two people died
on the football field.

20:29.708 --> 20:30.625
<i> Baba.</i>

20:31.750 --> 20:33.375
<i>Nizar is going to Germany.</i>

20:33.958 --> 20:35.541
Nizar?

20:38.083 --> 20:40.250
He'll travel with me and Sara
and protect us.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.250
I wouldn't trust him
to cross the road with you,

20:42.333 --> 20:44.000
let alone take you all the way to Germany.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.750
But, Ezzat,
Nizar is their cousin.

20:45.833 --> 20:49.541
-You know he would never leave them.
-Whose side are you on?

20:49.625 --> 20:50.916
I'm not taking sides.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.333
This isn't about us.
It's about the girls' lives.

20:54.416 --> 20:56.416
They don't have a future here anymore.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.916
They're not going to summer camp.
Aren't you a mother?

21:13.125 --> 21:17.791
Baba, you see what's happening.
The situation's gone from bad to worse.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.750
How am I gonna make it
to the Olympics if I can't swim?

21:21.375 --> 21:25.000
I promise, when I get to Europe,
I'll keep training.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.083
All the swimmers are leaving.

21:29.166 --> 21:32.458
See? I want to go.
I want to keep training.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.916
I'll have to go with you.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.166
And leave Mama and Shahed
on their own?

21:37.500 --> 21:39.833
What will become of me
if something happens to her?

21:39.916 --> 21:42.875
Nothing will happen.
Nizar and I will be with her.

21:42.958 --> 21:44.166
I promise.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.083
Thank you, Baba.

21:55.625 --> 21:57.958
<i>Please,</i>
<i>don't make me look like a liar.</i>

21:58.041 --> 21:59.916
I'm not going with you.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.583
OK? It's cold there,
and I don't like the cold.

22:03.666 --> 22:08.500
And I don't speak German. I speak English.
Romy knows a sponsor in Canada.

22:08.583 --> 22:11.166
He's gonna help me with my papers,
so I can go to Toronto.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.250
-It never works, these things.

22:14.291 --> 22:18.708
Canada is colder than Germany.
So good luck!

22:24.375 --> 22:25.625
Is she right?

22:26.125 --> 22:27.125
Dunno.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.083
Canada is
colder than Germany?

22:32.166 --> 22:35.041
-Of course.
-Don't think Germany. Think Berlin.

22:35.125 --> 22:39.250
DJ capital of the world,
parties that go on all weekend.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.666
Underground clubs.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.083
Berghain.

22:42.916 --> 22:45.541
-How do you know Berghain?
-Of course I know.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.833
DJ Niz needs European exposure.

22:49.791 --> 22:51.708
More people will listen to your mixes.

22:51.791 --> 22:56.041
How can you let your two favorite cousins
go to Europe without you?

22:56.541 --> 23:01.083
But you're not my favorite cousins.
I have other cousins who are nice to me.

23:01.166 --> 23:03.708
Fine. I will go without you.

23:09.625 --> 23:12.375
You fly to Istanbul
on a tourist visa.

23:12.458 --> 23:16.291
If anyone asks anything, you're tourists
going to Turkey on holiday.

23:16.375 --> 23:19.000
Find a smuggler
to take you over the Bulgarian border.

23:19.875 --> 23:24.083
This route is more expensive
than the sea crossing, but much safer.

23:28.208 --> 23:32.500
-Ten thousand euros. Guard it.
-How did you get it?

23:34.750 --> 23:36.000
I borrowed it.

23:36.083 --> 23:39.916
Isn't it too much, Baba?
Keep some for yourselves.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.083
I'll try to get more
in case you get stuck.

23:46.625 --> 23:50.833
But if you do get stuck,
you do the talking.

23:51.791 --> 23:54.208
Of course. Don't worry, Uncle.

23:57.250 --> 23:58.333
This is yours.

24:02.791 --> 24:06.291
Tell people you swam for your country.

24:06.791 --> 24:08.458
That has to matter.

24:09.458 --> 24:10.750
You too, Sara.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.500
Can I borrow your Converse?

24:21.583 --> 24:24.625
No, they are too big for you,
and I'm taking them with me.

24:24.708 --> 24:27.416
Can I use your nail polish?

24:29.416 --> 24:30.666
No, you'll ruin it.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.750
Can I come with you?

24:39.250 --> 24:41.041
Who would take care of Lulu?

24:54.625 --> 24:56.458
Look what I made you.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.291
You made this?

25:01.625 --> 25:04.208
It's to help you get to Germany.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.291
Oh, my love.

25:07.708 --> 25:09.416
I'm going to take it with me.

25:10.916 --> 25:14.166
Let's put Lulu in her cage
before she poops on your bed.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.375
Lulu.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.125
-Come help us.
-What are you doing?

25:29.291 --> 25:30.875
Lulu's flying!

25:46.708 --> 25:48.458
<i>When you were born,</i>

25:50.125 --> 25:52.833
<i>I decided to give you</i>
<i>the things I didn't have.</i>

25:56.250 --> 26:00.125
Freedom to choose
whatever you want in life.

26:00.208 --> 26:03.000
When I closed my eyes
and imagined your futures…

26:04.708 --> 26:05.708
Here he comes.

26:06.958 --> 26:10.583
<i>…I didn't picture you in</i>
<i>a wedding dress like the other mothers.</i>

26:11.666 --> 26:13.166
Sorry I'm late.

26:13.250 --> 26:14.916
What happened to you?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.250
I forgot my passport.

26:16.333 --> 26:17.541
<i>Habibi…</i>

26:17.625 --> 26:20.458
All I hoped was for you
to graduate from the best universities…

26:20.541 --> 26:24.750
Don't worry. They are like my sisters.
I'll guard them with my life.

26:24.833 --> 26:25.916
Come here.

26:27.833 --> 26:30.166
<i>Having wonderful careers</i>
<i>and living the best life,</i>

26:31.375 --> 26:33.041
<i>that was everything I wished for.</i>

26:36.375 --> 26:38.458
And we'll have all these things, Mama.

26:38.541 --> 26:40.000
Hopefully.

26:52.916 --> 26:54.250
Oh, my love.

27:02.208 --> 27:05.583
-I'll keep her safe. Don't worry.
-Keep yourself safe too.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.000
As soon as you arrive, call us, OK?

27:12.791 --> 27:14.750
Do you know that I love you?

27:14.833 --> 27:15.666
I know.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.083
Do you really know?

27:18.958 --> 27:21.791
Don't go. Please don't go.

27:21.875 --> 27:23.958
We'll meet in Germany soon.

27:24.041 --> 27:25.666
I swear. Really soon.

27:25.750 --> 27:28.666
-Passports. Where are you going?
-Istanbul.

27:29.666 --> 27:32.916
-Laptop, telephone…
-Have a safe journey.

27:35.208 --> 27:37.708
Laptop,
telephone, computer.

27:42.291 --> 27:43.916
May God protect you.

27:46.875 --> 27:50.541
<i>Passengers landing on flight number 221</i>

27:50.625 --> 27:52.625
<i>to Istanbul via Beirut,</i>

27:52.708 --> 27:55.083
<i>make your way to the gate now.</i>

28:01.750 --> 28:05.583
<i>Welcome aboard this flight to Istanbul.</i>

28:06.250 --> 28:08.000
<i>We would like to remind you</i>

28:08.083 --> 28:11.000
<i>that life jackets are</i>
<i>the property of the airline.</i>

28:11.083 --> 28:13.166
<i>Any attempt to take them</i>
<i>will be considered</i>

28:13.250 --> 28:16.875
<i>an act of theft,</i>
<i>and you will be prosecuted.</i>

28:16.958 --> 28:19.083
And the airline
would like to remind you

28:19.166 --> 28:22.458
that you're a bunch
of homeless refugees now.

28:25.541 --> 28:27.125
We're not refugees.

28:27.208 --> 28:28.500
We have a home.

28:45.083 --> 28:47.416
-<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>
<i>-Wa 'alaikum as-salaam.</i>

28:47.500 --> 28:49.083
We want one room.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.083
Oh, OK.

29:01.166 --> 29:02.875
So this is how it's gonna be.

29:02.958 --> 29:07.000
Yes. Yusra and me in the beds,
you on the floor next to the door

29:07.083 --> 29:09.166
so you can protect us
like you're meant to.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.666
Get used to it.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.750
Amazing.

29:13.875 --> 29:18.000
I saw on Facebook that there's a square
all the Syrians go to. We should go there.

29:18.083 --> 29:20.250
You think you're gonna handle
all the arrangements?

29:20.333 --> 29:22.208
This is what you agreed with Baba.

29:22.291 --> 29:24.833
-Exactly.
-Yeah, whatever.

29:25.833 --> 29:28.416
-You are keeping it there?
-Yeah, where no one looks.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.125
-Not what I heard!
-What did you hear?

29:33.250 --> 29:34.500
-<i>Yalla!</i>
-Yeah?

29:38.250 --> 29:40.208
Don't hurt my sister.

29:41.041 --> 29:42.125
That's my bed!

29:42.208 --> 29:44.250
-No, my bed.
-I'm gonna pass out here.

29:44.333 --> 29:46.250
-It's my bed!

29:47.375 --> 29:48.958
Enough. What?

29:51.041 --> 29:52.666
The floor it is.

29:54.166 --> 29:55.875
I love you guys.

30:27.208 --> 30:29.000
We're looking for a smuggler.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.250
Do you know someone reliable?

30:34.375 --> 30:35.750
<i>We have to cross that bridge.</i>

30:35.833 --> 30:37.083
I think we walked that way.

30:37.166 --> 30:41.375
Turkey has more than two million Syrians,
and he can't find any of them.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.916
We're still
on the European side.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.333
Yeah, so where do we go?

30:46.416 --> 30:47.958
We've taken the wrong bridge.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.125
Change of plan.
No more following Nizar. Following them.

30:54.750 --> 30:57.875
-What?
-From now on, we share leadership. <i>Yalla.</i>

30:58.666 --> 31:01.083
When exactly did I have leadership?

31:06.708 --> 31:09.708
See? We should have been
in charge from the start.

31:21.916 --> 31:23.666
They have SIM cards.

31:25.375 --> 31:27.708
-Do you speak English?
-A little.

31:27.791 --> 31:29.333
We want SIM cards for Europe.

31:40.916 --> 31:43.416
What?
Why are they dressed like that?

31:43.500 --> 31:47.291
They can't sell the suits,
so they put life jackets on them.

31:48.416 --> 31:50.625
-How much, please?
-$2,000 each.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.375
-$2,000?
-Yes.

31:56.041 --> 31:59.000
He says he can get us
on a boat straight to Lesbos.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.583
A bus will take us down to the coast.
It's $2,000 each.

32:02.666 --> 32:04.666
We pay half now and half when we arrive.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.791
Baba said not to get on a boat.

32:06.875 --> 32:09.166
He says the boats
have been getting through now.

32:10.041 --> 32:12.625
Do you know how long it takes
to walk the Bulgarian route?

32:12.708 --> 32:15.083
I don't know.
I think it's the best option.

32:15.166 --> 32:20.583
It's one boat, a few hours,
and then we're in Greece. In Europe.

32:20.666 --> 32:22.916
I can't believe
we're talking about taking a boat

32:23.000 --> 32:24.708
with the only Mardini who can't swim.

32:24.791 --> 32:27.958
-No, <i>habibi, </i>I can swim.
-I think we should go with him.

32:45.625 --> 32:49.083
No phone, no GP-Z,
no open curtain, no food, no toilet.

32:49.708 --> 32:51.541
No toilets for ten hours?

32:51.625 --> 32:53.416
-It's OK.

33:31.458 --> 33:32.333
<i>Yalla.</i>

33:36.666 --> 33:40.625
My friend, money,
dollar, euro, masari, fluz<i>…</i>

33:41.750 --> 33:43.666
Dollar, euro. OK?

33:43.750 --> 33:45.083
One?

33:45.166 --> 33:46.333
-Two.
-You?

33:46.416 --> 33:48.000
-For me and my sister.
-OK.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.375
One thousand?

33:51.500 --> 33:52.625
Good.

33:52.708 --> 33:54.166
They're my daughters.

33:54.250 --> 33:56.500
Euro, masari, fluz, dollar.

33:56.583 --> 33:57.416
<i>Yalla.</i>

33:57.500 --> 33:59.708
Everybody, go down. I bring boat.

34:00.875 --> 34:01.875
Go down.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.041
Down.

34:06.708 --> 34:08.041
We go down here?

34:12.458 --> 34:14.666
-You OK?
-Yeah.

34:32.583 --> 34:33.416
Hi!

34:35.500 --> 34:37.333
Do you speak English?

34:37.416 --> 34:38.250
Yes.

34:38.875 --> 34:40.625
Is it a boy or a girl?

34:40.708 --> 34:41.791
It's a girl.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.333
So cute!

34:49.500 --> 34:50.625
Hello!

34:54.625 --> 34:57.291
I'm Emad. Nice to meet you.

34:57.375 --> 34:58.416
I'm Yusra.

34:59.541 --> 35:02.750
And I'm Sara, her sister.
We come from Syria.

35:02.833 --> 35:05.500
-You're Syrian?
-Yeah, Syrian.

35:06.083 --> 35:08.416
-Hello, I'm Nizar Mardini.
-Hi.

35:09.125 --> 35:10.750
-What's your name?
-Ninar.

35:10.833 --> 35:13.666
-Where are you from?
-Afghanistan. Kabul.

35:13.750 --> 35:14.583
Oof.

35:14.666 --> 35:17.666
But this guy came
all the way from Somalia.

35:17.750 --> 35:19.375
He's been following me since Iran.

35:19.458 --> 35:22.291
You been following <i>me.</i>
He likes my cooking.

35:23.291 --> 35:25.500
I used to cook food
in a restaurant back home.

35:25.583 --> 35:27.333
-I'm Bilal.
-Hi.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.625
I'm going to miss him
when I get to Berlin.

35:30.125 --> 35:33.791
Oh, we are also going to Germany.
To Hanover. We have a friend there.

35:33.875 --> 35:34.708
Oh.

35:34.791 --> 35:36.541
-Where you from?

35:36.625 --> 35:40.375
I've come from Sudan with my wife, Onnab.
We're going to Sweden, hopefully.

35:40.875 --> 35:43.083
Hello, nice to meet you.

35:44.625 --> 35:47.250
What about you?
Where are you from?

35:47.333 --> 35:49.250
I am from Eritrea.

35:50.083 --> 35:51.333
And what's your name?

35:51.416 --> 35:52.375
Shada.

35:53.083 --> 35:54.875
We are going to the UK.

35:54.958 --> 35:56.000
Nice to meet you.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.416
Where's the smuggler?

36:04.416 --> 36:05.666
I hope he comes back.

36:58.291 --> 37:01.541
No, don't answer. They'll worry
if they know what we're doing.

37:01.625 --> 37:04.791
-I'll just text them, no?
-No. You wanna say what?

37:13.416 --> 37:15.083
I just saw a shooting star.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.666
Yeah, it's an angel
throwing away his cigarette

37:17.750 --> 37:19.750
so Allah can't catch him smoking.

37:21.583 --> 37:24.416
Why do you have to ruin everything
all the time?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.083
Thank you.

37:37.041 --> 37:38.041
Arsenal.

37:45.666 --> 37:47.541
-Are you OK?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

37:47.625 --> 37:48.625
Are you sure?

37:48.708 --> 37:51.666
Yeah, it's from yesterday, but I'm fine.
It's good.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.250
Let me see.

37:55.625 --> 37:59.500
Ooh, it's hurting you, huh?
One second. I'm gonna have to chop it off.

37:59.583 --> 38:00.916
-Like this.
-No! No!

38:03.000 --> 38:04.208
Not funny!

38:05.208 --> 38:07.083
-Then why are you laughing?

38:09.916 --> 38:11.125
We go down.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.625
<i>Yalla.</i>

38:18.958 --> 38:20.375
Come. Come.

38:21.583 --> 38:22.791
<i>Yalla, yalla.</i>

38:45.291 --> 38:47.666
OK, everybody. Now good to go.

38:47.750 --> 38:48.958
-OK?
-Now?

38:49.041 --> 38:50.291
Now good. No coastguard.

38:51.041 --> 38:52.625
No problem. No problem.

38:53.666 --> 38:56.000
OK. One person, one bag.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.791
One person, one bag.

38:57.875 --> 38:58.708
OK?

39:07.750 --> 39:10.041
-Can you take my daughter?
-Carry her?

39:15.458 --> 39:16.958
Take the bag.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.041
No, no, no, listen.

39:21.375 --> 39:22.500
<i>Baba.</i>

39:22.583 --> 39:25.708
Look at its condition.
It's impossible. Look how many people.

39:25.791 --> 39:26.958
We're not going.

39:28.916 --> 39:31.000
Sara, come.

39:31.083 --> 39:32.666
We've paid using everything we have.

39:32.750 --> 39:33.583
No, no.

39:33.666 --> 39:36.416
Shush!
Shush! No problem. Shush!

39:38.250 --> 39:41.416
We are too many.
We need a second boat. Second boat.

39:42.000 --> 39:42.958
No more room.

39:43.041 --> 39:45.833
-Inside!
-There's no more room in the boat.

39:45.916 --> 39:48.375
Listen. Don't shout.
Police come. No shout.

39:48.458 --> 39:50.708
-Wait, please, for everyone.
-Go!

39:50.791 --> 39:53.458
-We need another boat.
-We're a lot on the boat.

39:56.375 --> 39:58.166
OK, look.

39:58.250 --> 39:59.333
Left, right. OK?

39:59.416 --> 40:02.291
This, front, back. OK? Slow, good.

40:02.375 --> 40:04.583
Fast, no good, OK? Slow, OK?

40:09.375 --> 40:11.333
Friend? Not working.

40:11.416 --> 40:13.500
-Why is it not working?

40:13.583 --> 40:15.291
We paid $2,000, man.

40:15.375 --> 40:16.583
This boat's broken.

40:16.666 --> 40:18.541
-OK, let's get out.
-Go down.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.375
Wait. He's not going with us?

41:05.125 --> 41:08.416
Sara? What if
they don't know how to swim?

41:13.500 --> 41:15.250
Who here knows how to swim?

41:15.333 --> 41:16.791
Who knows how to swim?

41:20.041 --> 41:22.208
OK,
the people with their hands up,

41:22.291 --> 41:24.166
choose someone with their hands down.

41:24.250 --> 41:28.125
It's your duty to help them.
It's your responsibility.

41:28.208 --> 41:31.125
If your hand is up,
help those with their hands down.

41:34.083 --> 41:36.958
Shada. Don't worry.

41:38.166 --> 41:39.000
Both of us?

41:39.916 --> 41:40.916
Yes.

41:41.833 --> 41:42.708
Nizar.

41:44.166 --> 41:46.666
We're in this together.
We need to work together.

41:46.750 --> 41:50.416
We're in this together.
We'll help each other.

41:58.750 --> 41:59.791
God is great.

42:01.250 --> 42:03.583
Put your faith in God, guys.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.958
This boat is damaged.
I swear it's damaged.

42:32.458 --> 42:34.583
Oh God, we're gonna sink.

42:35.916 --> 42:37.250
It's leaking.

42:38.666 --> 42:40.541
It's from the waves. Don't worry.

42:40.625 --> 42:42.083
It's full of water, man.

42:42.166 --> 42:43.791
Guys, it won't sink.

42:43.875 --> 42:45.250
We won't sink.

42:46.333 --> 42:48.791
We can handle this. Don't worry.

42:49.708 --> 42:50.541
<i>Baba…</i>

42:51.208 --> 42:52.708
Don't be scared, son.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.416
Why the engine stops?

43:00.875 --> 43:03.208
-Why did the engine stop?
-Calm down!

43:03.291 --> 43:05.250
-Everybody, calm down, OK?

43:05.333 --> 43:06.583
Calm down.

43:06.666 --> 43:08.416
Calm down. It's OK.

43:14.375 --> 43:16.125
-Go.

43:16.750 --> 43:17.708
Emad.

43:17.791 --> 43:18.958
One more time.

43:19.041 --> 43:20.333
-Go.

43:20.416 --> 43:22.875
-We're trying. Do we have enough fuel?

43:24.166 --> 43:25.958
Yes, that's fuel. It's good.

43:26.041 --> 43:27.833
We're gonna be good. Don't worry.

43:31.750 --> 43:33.541
-Bilal.
-OK.

43:34.958 --> 43:35.958
Hold it.

43:42.375 --> 43:43.458
Let me pass.

43:44.666 --> 43:47.125
Sit down.
You have to keep the balance of the boat.

43:47.208 --> 43:49.625
Watch out for the kids.
The kids!

43:51.250 --> 43:52.500
Listen to me. Listen.

43:52.583 --> 43:54.541
I studied
mechanical engineering.

43:54.625 --> 43:58.416
I studied mechanical
engineering. I'll try to fix the engine.

44:07.958 --> 44:09.500
Stay calm.

44:14.041 --> 44:16.791
-What do you know?
-Sir, you know how to do this?

44:17.375 --> 44:20.625
I don't know, but I will try.
I'm in my first year, OK?

44:20.708 --> 44:26.583
God is the greatest.

44:34.208 --> 44:35.666
This one?

44:36.583 --> 44:39.833
-Put it back in.

44:42.083 --> 44:42.958
Pull!

45:35.166 --> 45:36.375
We're too heavy.

45:36.458 --> 45:40.291
Everything we don't need, in the sea.
Throw everything we don't need.

45:41.583 --> 45:42.916
Throw everything!

45:46.250 --> 45:47.708
We're too heavy!

45:53.500 --> 45:55.458
-Keep bailing!
-Please!

45:55.541 --> 45:57.333
We need to get the water out.

45:57.416 --> 45:58.291
Quickly!

45:58.375 --> 46:00.166
-Keep bailing!

46:08.958 --> 46:10.708
Keep bailing!

46:38.291 --> 46:41.291
We're doing
the same thing over and over again.

46:41.875 --> 46:45.416
Guys, I've got network.
The coastguards. It's ringing.

46:46.250 --> 46:47.083
Hello?

46:47.166 --> 46:50.083
Help. We need emergency assistance.

46:50.166 --> 46:53.000
We're in a boat
stuck between Ayvalik, Turkey, and Lesbos.

46:53.083 --> 46:54.166
Our engine has stopped.

46:57.250 --> 46:59.250
But we are in Greek waters!

46:59.333 --> 47:03.041
-<i>Can you go back?</i>
-No, we can't go back. We are sinking.

47:03.125 --> 47:06.583
You don't understand. We have children.
We have women. We are going to die.

47:06.666 --> 47:10.208
Please, I don't understand.
We will die. Please. Hello?

47:14.041 --> 47:15.750
He said it's not their policy.

47:25.541 --> 47:26.791
Bail out the water!

47:27.291 --> 47:29.000
We must try. Bilal.

47:29.083 --> 47:31.125
Abdo. Give me your knife.

47:31.916 --> 47:34.416
Sit down!
Keep the balance of the boat!

47:34.500 --> 47:36.875
Sara. Sara, what are you doing?

47:38.166 --> 47:40.250
-Help me with the rope.
-Sara!

47:42.041 --> 47:44.500
-Sara, sit down.
-Sara, what are you doing?

47:44.583 --> 47:46.750
We need to
make the boat lighter.

47:47.541 --> 47:48.541
Please!

47:50.583 --> 47:51.458
Sara.

47:52.208 --> 47:54.000
-Just keep bailing.
-OK.

47:55.708 --> 47:57.416
-Sara!

47:58.583 --> 47:59.583
Sara!

48:04.041 --> 48:04.875
Sara!

48:10.208 --> 48:13.541
No. No, Yusra. You'll die.
For God's sake, don't do this!

48:13.625 --> 48:17.291
Please! I'm not letting her
in the water. Leave me alone!

48:20.541 --> 48:22.291
Don't let her get in.

48:22.375 --> 48:23.916
What can I do?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
If you go in, I go in.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.250
No!

48:41.833 --> 48:43.958
Sara's right. We're too heavy.

48:44.041 --> 48:46.208
I can't swim.
If I could swim, I'd be in there.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.291
It's OK. It's OK.

48:50.208 --> 48:51.291
No!

48:57.375 --> 48:59.958
What are you doing? No!

49:05.250 --> 49:06.375
Are you crazy?

49:15.666 --> 49:17.666
It's working! The engine's working!

49:18.458 --> 49:20.041
The engine's started!

49:22.875 --> 49:24.291
Pull, Nizar.

49:33.083 --> 49:34.458
We are sinking!

49:40.208 --> 49:43.708
Sara, the engine's started!
Come in.

49:43.791 --> 49:46.416
No. The boat will sink.

49:46.500 --> 49:49.041
It's too dangerous.

50:00.708 --> 50:01.833
Sara!

50:35.458 --> 50:36.708
<i>Find your lane.</i>

50:38.166 --> 50:39.333
<i>Swim your race.</i>

51:50.000 --> 51:51.166
<i>Yusra!</i>

51:52.791 --> 51:53.666
Yusra!

51:54.375 --> 51:55.291
Look.

51:57.041 --> 51:59.750
Almost there! I see land!

52:31.958 --> 52:33.375
Push. <i>Yalla.</i>

52:39.291 --> 52:41.458
Women and children are first.

52:51.708 --> 52:56.291
We made it! We made it! We made it!

52:57.250 --> 52:58.416
We made it!

56:28.666 --> 56:29.916
-Excuse me.
-Sir.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.166
Can we have water
for everyone, please?

56:32.250 --> 56:33.166
No refugee.

56:33.250 --> 56:36.500
-No, sir, we have money. We can pay.
-No refugee, no.

56:37.500 --> 56:38.791
-Let's go.

56:44.583 --> 56:45.583
There's a tap.

56:45.666 --> 56:47.375
Guys, there's water.

56:47.458 --> 56:50.125
-Come. There's water.

56:51.208 --> 56:52.583
Bring the children.

56:53.791 --> 56:54.833
-Go.
-No, you go.

56:54.916 --> 56:56.166
-No.
<i>-Habibi, </i>you go.

56:56.250 --> 56:57.791
No, let her finish.

57:25.208 --> 57:28.083
-A missed call from your mother.
-You still have your phone?

57:28.166 --> 57:30.666
-I can share it. We can all share it.
-OK.

57:30.750 --> 57:32.916
<i>I called a million times.</i>

57:33.000 --> 57:34.791
<i>-Are you OK? Where are you?</i>

57:34.875 --> 57:36.916
In Lesbos. We're in Europe, Mama.

57:37.000 --> 57:43.208
<i>Thank God.</i>
<i>I've been praying for you every day.</i>

57:43.291 --> 57:46.833
Bless you, Auntie.
Update my mother and look after her.

57:46.916 --> 57:48.458
<i>Mama's crying.</i>

57:48.541 --> 57:49.750
<i>Yalla, </i>Shahed!

57:49.833 --> 57:53.166
<i>Joey's out of </i>American Idol,
<i>and it's not fair.</i>

57:53.250 --> 57:54.583
<i>And I miss--</i>

57:56.958 --> 57:58.750
We will find a charger, huh?

58:12.916 --> 58:15.041
It's over there by the truck.

58:19.583 --> 58:21.083
Thank you.

58:21.166 --> 58:24.541
Yes, you can put them
over here. We have plenty of supplies.

58:25.333 --> 58:27.291
-Thank you.
-For the baby.

58:27.791 --> 58:30.458
Thank you so much. Thank you.

58:31.333 --> 58:33.250
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

58:33.333 --> 58:34.916
OK. For you.

58:35.416 --> 58:37.625
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

58:49.166 --> 58:51.333
Oh, that one with the writing.

59:20.208 --> 59:22.083
I saw this seagull
floating above us.

59:23.916 --> 59:25.916
It stayed with us for a long time.

59:28.416 --> 59:30.875
For some reason,
it felt like it was guiding us.

59:32.541 --> 59:35.541
All I was thinking was how
Mama and Baba had no idea where we were.

59:35.625 --> 59:37.250
And how we didn't answer the phone.

59:40.291 --> 59:43.375
And how stupid it would be
for swimmers to die in the sea.

59:48.625 --> 59:51.833
Do you know what Baba will do
if he knows I let you get in the water?

59:54.125 --> 59:55.708
He'll be proud.

1:00:11.208 --> 1:00:13.416
-One tea for Sara.
-Thank you.

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:14.916
One tea for me,

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:18.333
and one, two, three, four… 125 sugar…

1:00:18.416 --> 1:00:19.916
-Three.
-…for Sara.

1:00:22.833 --> 1:00:24.875
Now, what you both did in the sea,

1:00:25.458 --> 1:00:26.583
it was…

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:30.958
I'm sorry I couldn't stay in, you know.

1:00:32.291 --> 1:00:33.708
I don't know how you…

1:00:34.208 --> 1:00:35.750
Well, she got in the sea first.

1:00:37.125 --> 1:00:38.666
She's a superhero.

1:00:39.791 --> 1:00:40.791
I agree.

1:00:42.791 --> 1:00:45.916
You could have told me that
you were professional swimmers.

1:00:47.375 --> 1:00:49.750
If there's anything you both need,
you just ask me.

1:00:49.833 --> 1:00:52.666
Well, the only thing I need now
is to wash my hair.

1:00:52.750 --> 1:00:55.958
-It's full of salt.
-Ah, there's showers behind this building.

1:00:56.041 --> 1:00:57.041
Really?

1:00:57.125 --> 1:00:59.583
-But the queue was very long.
-Queue?

1:00:59.666 --> 1:01:01.916
Come on. Superheroes don't queue.

1:01:02.416 --> 1:01:03.333
OK.

1:01:03.916 --> 1:01:06.125
I'll find a shower without a queue.

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:13.000
<i>-Yalla, </i>let's do it.
-What are you doing?

1:01:13.083 --> 1:01:15.500
-We need to look European.
-And rich.

1:01:15.583 --> 1:01:17.583
This way, you will see that I have money.

1:01:17.666 --> 1:01:19.458
-We need to work on this boy here.
-No.

1:01:20.458 --> 1:01:22.750
-Unbutton this.
-Trust us.

1:01:22.833 --> 1:01:24.208
I don't trust you.

1:01:24.291 --> 1:01:25.541
Look at me.

1:01:25.625 --> 1:01:27.541
-What is this hair?
-I like my hair.

1:01:27.625 --> 1:01:29.166
It's awful.

1:01:29.250 --> 1:01:32.750
You look like a very big businessman,
very proud of himself.

1:01:32.833 --> 1:01:34.875
-I look European and rich. Come on.
-Let's go.

1:01:34.958 --> 1:01:35.791
Yeah.

1:01:43.375 --> 1:01:44.458
Ciao.

1:02:10.083 --> 1:02:12.833
They have no idea
people are dying in that sea.

1:02:59.541 --> 1:03:01.541
<i>So how are we gonna get to Germany?</i>

1:03:02.333 --> 1:03:05.375
<i>We should all follow</i>
<i>the train tracks from city to city,</i>

1:03:05.458 --> 1:03:09.000
<i>through Greece, Macedonia,</i>
<i>Serbia, and Hungary,</i>

1:03:09.083 --> 1:03:10.875
<i>Austria, to Germany.</i>

1:03:11.875 --> 1:03:14.041
<i>It will be safer if we travel together.</i>

1:03:37.333 --> 1:03:38.458
It looks bad.

1:03:52.583 --> 1:03:53.666
Why the UK?

1:03:54.291 --> 1:03:55.625
Is your husband there?

1:03:57.666 --> 1:03:58.625
Shh…

1:03:58.708 --> 1:03:59.958
Is he dead?

1:04:02.458 --> 1:04:03.625
My husband is

1:04:04.875 --> 1:04:05.875
not good man.

1:04:15.833 --> 1:04:18.750
You don't wear hijab. You swim.

1:04:20.541 --> 1:04:23.125
I have never met a girl like you before.

1:04:24.333 --> 1:04:27.500
Well, my dad was a professional swimmer.

1:04:28.666 --> 1:04:32.291
He swam for Syria,
and he loved it so much.

1:04:34.791 --> 1:04:36.666
But he had to stop.

1:04:37.958 --> 1:04:41.916
And, actually, he only had daughters,
so he had to train us.

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.625
He was our coach, my sister and I.

1:04:44.708 --> 1:04:46.666
And now you are his ambition.

1:04:46.750 --> 1:04:47.791
Yes.

1:04:49.166 --> 1:04:51.541
I love it. Swimming is home for me.

1:04:52.916 --> 1:04:54.958
I feel like it's where I belong.

1:04:56.875 --> 1:04:58.791
And…

1:05:00.250 --> 1:05:03.041
one day, I want to swim in the Olympics.

1:05:03.125 --> 1:05:04.833
I was hoping Rio.

1:05:08.333 --> 1:05:10.583
But it feels so far away right now.

1:05:16.041 --> 1:05:17.958
I don't know if I can do it.

1:05:21.250 --> 1:05:23.083
I believe you can do it.

1:06:13.750 --> 1:06:15.583
So what will you do in Hanover?

1:06:16.083 --> 1:06:18.416
Bring the rest of my family over.

1:06:19.791 --> 1:06:20.791
And then?

1:06:21.291 --> 1:06:24.416
I don't know. Sing a song, plant a tree.

1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:27.041
-And I want to study.

1:06:28.166 --> 1:06:29.166
Art, maybe.

1:06:29.250 --> 1:06:31.708
I want to study too. Literature.

1:06:33.041 --> 1:06:36.833
Yeah, I must also find a job.
I have to send money home.

1:06:37.458 --> 1:06:38.541
To your wife?

1:06:38.625 --> 1:06:40.250
No, I am not married.

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:44.166
-Are you?
-Hey.

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:46.375
Name one married superhero.

1:06:46.458 --> 1:06:49.541
-Ah, didn't Superman marry Lois Lane?
-You speak English?

1:06:49.625 --> 1:06:50.875
<i>Female </i>superhero.

1:06:51.625 --> 1:06:53.250
Hey, you speak English?

1:06:54.708 --> 1:06:55.708
-English?
-Yes.

1:06:56.208 --> 1:06:58.791
You cross border at Tabanovce,
they will put you in camp.

1:06:58.875 --> 1:06:59.708
Who?

1:06:59.791 --> 1:07:00.791
Serbian police.

1:07:08.541 --> 1:07:10.291
They will take your fingerprints.

1:07:10.791 --> 1:07:13.291
Once they take your fingerprints,
you are stuck.

1:07:13.375 --> 1:07:15.416
I can take you to Hungary.

1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:18.416
No police. No fingerprint. No problem.

1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:21.208
-<i>How much?</i>
-<i>Five hundred euro each.</i>

1:07:21.291 --> 1:07:22.625
-<i>Yeah?</i>
-<i>Yeah.</i>

1:07:23.125 --> 1:07:25.125
<i>Are we crazy to do this?</i>

1:07:45.583 --> 1:07:46.666
-Out.
-Get out.

1:07:46.750 --> 1:07:48.541
-No go to Hungary.
-Out of my truck.

1:07:49.125 --> 1:07:50.166
-Out.
-Listen.

1:07:50.250 --> 1:07:51.791
Get the fuck out!

1:07:51.875 --> 1:07:53.625
-But we paid them.
-Give me my money!

1:07:53.708 --> 1:07:54.625
-You hear me?
-Out.

1:07:54.708 --> 1:07:56.833
Hey, stop.

1:07:56.916 --> 1:07:59.833
You said you'd take us to Hungary!
Where are we?

1:08:02.916 --> 1:08:03.916
I don't know.

1:08:05.083 --> 1:08:06.958
Let's just go this way, OK?

1:08:26.875 --> 1:08:28.166
What's happening?

1:08:29.166 --> 1:08:31.208
-It's razor wire.
-Careful.

1:08:31.291 --> 1:08:32.375
Push.

1:08:33.166 --> 1:08:35.000
It's OK.

1:08:35.750 --> 1:08:37.500
Be careful.

1:08:37.583 --> 1:08:38.833
-I have her.
-Careful.

1:08:38.916 --> 1:08:40.541
OK. It's OK.

1:08:41.916 --> 1:08:44.083
There's English. English.

1:08:48.333 --> 1:08:50.750
-Where do they want to go?
-Budapest, Hungary.

1:08:50.833 --> 1:08:51.958
Eight hundred euro.

1:08:52.458 --> 1:08:53.458
For everyone?

1:08:54.333 --> 1:08:55.791
-Each?!
-No, that's too much.

1:08:56.625 --> 1:08:58.708
Maybe you want police to catch you.

1:09:00.750 --> 1:09:02.000
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1:09:09.916 --> 1:09:11.375
What are you doing?

1:09:12.083 --> 1:09:13.958
Better not to look so foreign.

1:09:22.416 --> 1:09:23.916
Maybe it's better?

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.291
Yes, no problem.

1:09:29.208 --> 1:09:30.333
Please.

1:09:52.833 --> 1:09:56.416
You need one English speaker
in each car for border guard.

1:09:56.500 --> 1:09:58.916
-Go.
-<i>Yalla, </i>get in the car.

1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.208
We can't split up.

1:10:00.291 --> 1:10:02.833
She said one English speaker each car, OK?

1:10:02.916 --> 1:10:04.583
I speak English if you want to.

1:10:04.666 --> 1:10:06.708
I want to be
in the same car as you. Please.

1:10:06.791 --> 1:10:09.125
What about the border guards?
We need to help the others.

1:10:09.208 --> 1:10:11.625
-Please.
-Don't worry. I'll see you in Hungary.

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:12.708
<i>Yalla!</i>

1:10:12.791 --> 1:10:14.166
-Sara, please.
-Get in.

1:10:14.250 --> 1:10:15.083
Sara!

1:10:17.041 --> 1:10:18.458
Go. Get in car.

1:10:21.250 --> 1:10:22.750
Get in car! Go!

1:10:38.541 --> 1:10:39.750
Shit.

1:10:53.750 --> 1:10:55.333
-Hold on.

1:11:15.416 --> 1:11:17.250
Hungary border.
Be careful.

1:12:24.375 --> 1:12:26.208
Quick. We have two minutes
and then they come.

1:13:17.375 --> 1:13:19.333
Thank God you're safe.

1:13:19.416 --> 1:13:21.250
-Welcome to Hungary.
-Praise God.

1:13:21.333 --> 1:13:24.333
-Where's Sara?
-Still hasn't arrived.

1:13:25.833 --> 1:13:28.166
Why don't you bring a sign?
"We're refugees."

1:13:28.791 --> 1:13:30.666
Go inside. You wait inside.

1:13:31.333 --> 1:13:33.541
Don't worry.
She'll be here soon.

1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:48.708
<i>It is not quite on a biblical scale,</i>

1:13:48.791 --> 1:13:50.791
<i>but an exodus it certainly is.</i>

1:13:50.875 --> 1:13:53.916
<i>The refugees and migrants</i>
<i>who've been trapped now deciding to walk.</i>

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.833
They're marching all the way to Germany.

1:13:55.916 --> 1:13:59.250
<i>They've set out on a hopeless quest,</i>
<i>but the fact they've done this at all</i>

1:13:59.333 --> 1:14:02.083
<i>reflects their desperation</i>
<i>being stuck in Budapest.</i>

1:14:02.166 --> 1:14:04.375
You can come to the UK with us.

1:14:05.125 --> 1:14:06.208
If you need to.

1:14:06.875 --> 1:14:09.166
<i>The German chancellor Angela Merkel</i>

1:14:09.250 --> 1:14:12.708
<i>has been calling for a coordinated</i>
<i>European response to the crisis.</i>

1:14:13.208 --> 1:14:14.916
Thinks Merkel is his mother.

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.291
<i>Germany, help us!</i>

1:14:17.375 --> 1:14:18.708
<i>My country is war.</i>

1:14:18.791 --> 1:14:22.583
<i>No help. The children,</i>
<i>they no help, the family. Why no help?</i>

1:14:22.666 --> 1:14:25.291
-<i>Germany, help us!</i>
-<i>Germany, help us!</i>

1:14:46.375 --> 1:14:47.416
<i>Yusra.</i>

1:14:50.333 --> 1:14:51.375
<i>Yusra.</i>

1:14:54.916 --> 1:14:56.833
Always late, but worth the wait.

1:14:59.416 --> 1:15:01.750
They stopped us. They had a big dog.

1:15:01.833 --> 1:15:04.958
But we were so lucky.
The driver convinced them to let us go,

1:15:05.041 --> 1:15:07.041
and now I'm here. I made it.

1:15:18.625 --> 1:15:19.708
Finally.

1:15:21.958 --> 1:15:24.166
She was scared
you wouldn't make it.

1:15:33.166 --> 1:15:34.916
Oh. I'm sorry.

1:15:37.708 --> 1:15:38.708
You're OK.

1:16:32.916 --> 1:16:34.208
Animal!

1:16:47.458 --> 1:16:49.500
You have water in there
and oxygen.

1:16:49.583 --> 1:16:51.250
I'm not one of these criminals.

1:16:51.333 --> 1:16:54.791
You can tell your friends
this is good business. You understand?

1:16:54.875 --> 1:16:57.416
70% of my drivers get through to Germany.

1:17:05.583 --> 1:17:06.583
-Viktor.
-Yeah?

1:17:06.666 --> 1:17:08.500
-Can we have a look?
-Come.

1:17:08.583 --> 1:17:10.375
I'm not getting in that truck.

1:17:11.416 --> 1:17:12.958
But we have to stay together.

1:17:13.458 --> 1:17:16.250
He was recommended to Bilal
by someone who got through.

1:17:16.333 --> 1:17:17.166
I can't.

1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:24.708
-I know, but we have to go. We need to go.
-I told you, I can't.

1:17:25.333 --> 1:17:28.041
Go alone if you want to.
We'll meet in Germany.

1:17:28.583 --> 1:17:31.708
-You expect me to leave you?
-You already did.

1:17:35.666 --> 1:17:36.708
What's going on?

1:17:39.041 --> 1:17:40.625
She won't get into the truck.

1:17:51.583 --> 1:17:53.666
You OK? What happen?

1:17:53.750 --> 1:17:55.791
We've decided
not to take the truck.

1:17:56.916 --> 1:17:58.375
But what will you do?

1:17:59.583 --> 1:18:02.083
Join the march to Germany, I guess.

1:18:03.083 --> 1:18:04.875
I can't walk anymore.

1:18:16.041 --> 1:18:17.625
We will all meet again.

1:18:18.125 --> 1:18:19.625
I'm sure of it.

1:18:21.125 --> 1:18:24.708
Let's see if you will be happy
when she lives on your carpet for months.

1:18:24.791 --> 1:18:26.958
You are welcome on my carpet anytime.

1:18:29.583 --> 1:18:31.041
-Take care.
-Nizar.

1:18:31.125 --> 1:18:32.333
Take care.

1:18:38.916 --> 1:18:41.083
-She told me.
-Guys?

1:18:42.416 --> 1:18:43.291
You stay safe.

1:18:43.375 --> 1:18:44.333
We're gonna…

1:18:44.416 --> 1:18:45.666
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1:18:45.750 --> 1:18:48.250
…find a new way with Nizar and Yusra.

1:18:50.416 --> 1:18:51.500
So we're gonna go.

1:18:51.583 --> 1:18:54.291
-Please take care.
-I'm gonna miss you.

1:18:54.375 --> 1:18:56.041
We will go a new way.

1:18:57.500 --> 1:19:00.000
-There you are.

1:19:03.166 --> 1:19:04.041
Bye.

1:19:04.666 --> 1:19:05.666
Bye.

1:19:15.083 --> 1:19:16.583
Emad? <i>Yalla, </i>let's go.

1:19:26.583 --> 1:19:27.833
Wait, wait.

1:19:28.541 --> 1:19:30.708
I don't think we can afford this.

1:19:30.791 --> 1:19:34.208
-How much money do we have?
-I'll spend all my money if I have to.

1:19:35.750 --> 1:19:37.041
She has to rest.

1:20:11.125 --> 1:20:12.000
What?

1:20:12.875 --> 1:20:14.291
Can you smell it?

1:20:14.375 --> 1:20:17.000
-No.
-Mama's making <i>barazek.</i>

1:20:17.083 --> 1:20:18.791
-Stop it.
-What?

1:20:18.875 --> 1:20:20.291
I'm not in the mood.

1:20:23.916 --> 1:20:26.041
I miss them so much.

1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.083
Me too. And Lulu.

1:20:35.166 --> 1:20:38.208
She's shitting
all over your bed!

1:20:39.416 --> 1:20:40.958
Oh no. Guess who's here.

1:20:41.041 --> 1:20:42.416
-Who?
-Baba.

1:20:42.500 --> 1:20:45.208
Baba's coming with the resistance bands.

1:20:45.291 --> 1:20:47.541
-I don't want to stretch! No!
-No, come on.

1:20:47.625 --> 1:20:50.083
-I refuse! No, I don't want it.
-No.

1:20:50.166 --> 1:20:52.916
-I miss the resistance bands. I miss them.
-No.

1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.708
-I refuse. Say no.
-I won't.

1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.583
Pack your bags and get ready
because Nizar is taking you to Germany.

1:21:01.166 --> 1:21:02.916
-What?
-I'm serious. <i>Yalla, </i>quick.

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.416
Get your things. There's a bus.

1:21:05.250 --> 1:21:08.166
It has been sent by the Austrians
or maybe the Germans. I don't know.

1:21:08.250 --> 1:21:12.625
But they saw the march,
and they want to help us. Hmm?

1:21:13.541 --> 1:21:16.083
Do you know what's the best part?
We don't need tickets.

1:21:18.166 --> 1:21:19.333
What? It's free?

1:21:19.958 --> 1:21:23.208
-How did you know about it?
-I'm good at some things, you know.

1:21:23.291 --> 1:21:26.166
Now pack your bags and admit it.

1:21:32.833 --> 1:21:34.708
Get up. We need to dress.

1:21:36.791 --> 1:21:38.208
-Go. we need to pack.
-Quick.

1:21:38.291 --> 1:21:40.708
I'll be waiting at the reception. Quick.

1:21:46.083 --> 1:21:46.958
<i>Yalla.</i>

1:21:48.083 --> 1:21:49.333
It's a trap.

1:21:51.291 --> 1:21:55.041
They'll put us in a refugee camp,
and we won't ever get out.

1:21:55.708 --> 1:21:57.250
No one cares.

1:22:00.541 --> 1:22:02.625
Maybe we should go home.

1:22:03.458 --> 1:22:05.458
We're not going back now, Yusra.

1:22:05.541 --> 1:22:07.375
Don't you see how far we've come?

1:22:08.375 --> 1:22:10.125
I'm not giving up now.

1:22:10.958 --> 1:22:11.958
Look at me.

1:22:23.416 --> 1:22:26.458
I listened to you before.
Now you need to listen to me.

1:22:26.958 --> 1:22:28.125
Listen to you?

1:22:34.291 --> 1:22:35.541
If we went with the others.

1:22:35.625 --> 1:22:37.291
If we didn't come at all.

1:22:37.375 --> 1:22:38.916
So it's my fault?

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.500
Is it mine?

1:22:43.041 --> 1:22:45.125
Why did you bring me here if you hate me?

1:22:46.583 --> 1:22:47.750
To save you.

1:22:48.333 --> 1:22:49.583
And save the family.

1:23:14.250 --> 1:23:16.416
Was that man trying to save me?

1:23:18.458 --> 1:23:20.375
I wouldn't have let him hurt you.

1:23:21.958 --> 1:23:23.875
I wouldn't let him do anything to you.

1:23:32.625 --> 1:23:35.291
I'm scared something bad
will happen again.

1:23:37.583 --> 1:23:39.250
I wouldn't be able to take it.

1:23:47.166 --> 1:23:48.416
If I say no…

1:23:50.875 --> 1:23:52.541
would you go without me?

1:23:54.375 --> 1:23:55.791
Of course, yes.

1:23:56.500 --> 1:23:59.375
No. We go together or not at all.

1:24:02.041 --> 1:24:03.333
And I don't hate you.

1:24:04.875 --> 1:24:06.500
I don't hate you either.

1:24:09.666 --> 1:24:11.000
Most of the time.

1:24:16.250 --> 1:24:19.583
-<i>Passengers for bus two, please.</i>
-Quickly.

1:24:19.666 --> 1:24:21.041
Which one though?

1:24:21.125 --> 1:24:23.083
He said number seven.

1:24:23.166 --> 1:24:25.375
-<i>Bus number five…</i>
-Hey, excuse me.

1:24:25.458 --> 1:24:28.291
-God, there's a lot of people.
-<i>Passengers for bus five.</i>

1:24:28.375 --> 1:24:30.750
No, that's number three.

1:24:31.583 --> 1:24:34.041
-Bus number seven?
-Go, <i>yalla!</i>

1:24:34.833 --> 1:24:37.416
<i>Passengers for bus seven, please.</i>

1:25:12.250 --> 1:25:13.916
-Is this Germany?

1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:15.583
Yes, we are in Berlin.

1:25:17.750 --> 1:25:19.125
We've arrived!

1:25:30.333 --> 1:25:33.625
Hello, Baba. We've arrived in Berlin.

1:25:33.708 --> 1:25:36.750
Uncle, we've arrived in Germany!

1:25:36.833 --> 1:25:38.833
We'll be seeing you soon.

1:25:38.916 --> 1:25:39.833
I love you all.

1:25:45.750 --> 1:25:47.875
Hi.
Welcome to Germany.

1:25:48.750 --> 1:25:50.958
-Hey, welcome to Berlin.
-Thank you.

1:25:51.041 --> 1:25:52.625
The Germans are welcoming us.

1:25:52.708 --> 1:25:54.166
Enough. We made it.

1:25:54.916 --> 1:25:56.083
We made it.

1:25:57.875 --> 1:26:01.625
<i>Please have passports</i>
<i>and paperwork ready. Thank you.</i>

1:26:05.166 --> 1:26:07.708
And your name?
Passport, please.

1:26:17.125 --> 1:26:18.041
The form, please.

1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:29.000
Thank you.

1:26:41.416 --> 1:26:44.250
Uh, Yusra Mardini <i>und</i> Sara Mardini?

1:26:45.125 --> 1:26:47.750
Hi, I am Diana.
Please, come with me.

1:26:47.833 --> 1:26:50.250
-OK.
-Uh, what about our cousin?

1:26:51.333 --> 1:26:53.000
He will be housed with the men.

1:26:53.083 --> 1:26:55.916
-I will be able to see them later, right?
-Yeah.

1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.333
OK, thank you.

1:26:57.416 --> 1:27:00.041
<i>…please report</i>
<i>to hangar seven at 2:00 p.m.</i>

1:27:00.125 --> 1:27:00.958
Bye.

1:27:01.458 --> 1:27:05.166
<i>There are buses outside</i>
<i>the main entrance that go into Berlin.</i>

1:27:05.250 --> 1:27:09.166
Um, the locker number,
your locker number is on your ID card.

1:27:10.416 --> 1:27:13.375
-We actually need to go to Hanover.
-Yes.

1:27:13.458 --> 1:27:14.666
Our friend is there.

1:27:15.291 --> 1:27:17.750
You… You are registered here.

1:27:17.833 --> 1:27:21.791
You will be eligible for nothing
if you move to Hanover, I'm afraid.

1:27:22.875 --> 1:27:24.791
-What?
-I dunno.

1:27:25.375 --> 1:27:26.916
You are here.

1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:30.375
Unit C3 in hangar five.

1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:32.125
There's no doors.

1:27:32.208 --> 1:27:33.750
Ah, it's a fire risk.

1:27:33.833 --> 1:27:35.416
Uh, there is a curtain.

1:27:39.375 --> 1:27:40.416
Thank you.

1:27:42.666 --> 1:27:44.041
-Hi.
-Hello.

1:27:44.833 --> 1:27:45.791
-Hi.
-Hello.

1:28:08.791 --> 1:28:11.916
You're not going to bed
on our first night in Berlin, huh?

1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.625
You promised me clubs.
I need to hear some music.

1:28:14.708 --> 1:28:15.916
-Nizar…
<i>-Yalla, </i>get up.

1:28:16.791 --> 1:28:19.375
-We don't have enough money.
-Just come.

1:28:21.291 --> 1:28:23.500
We're really going to a club
in our pajamas?

1:28:23.583 --> 1:28:25.291
Just trust me, OK?

1:28:25.375 --> 1:28:29.583
It's not Berghain,
but DJ Niz is on the decks!

1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:54.083
<i>Don't worry. The bomb</i>
<i>landed in waste ground behind the house.</i>

1:29:54.166 --> 1:29:58.041
<i>Baba is checking on Uncle Ahmed.</i>
<i>Did you see about the asylum papers?</i>

1:29:58.125 --> 1:30:01.791
Not yet. We're still waiting.
They have to give us an appointment first.

1:30:04.250 --> 1:30:07.083
<i>The upper house of</i>
<i>the Russian parliament earlier granted</i>

1:30:07.166 --> 1:30:10.916
<i>President Vladimir Putin permission</i>
<i>to deploy the Russian air force in Syria.</i>

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:12.458
It's not Damascus.

1:30:15.125 --> 1:30:16.666
Our turn is coming.

1:30:16.750 --> 1:30:20.125
<i>…rebel-controlled areas,</i>
<i>resulting in the deaths of 36 people.</i>

1:30:25.375 --> 1:30:27.625
<i>The US</i>
<i>and its allies have insisted…</i>

1:32:15.125 --> 1:32:16.458
It will never work.

1:32:23.041 --> 1:32:25.583
Yusra, he's training.

1:32:25.666 --> 1:32:29.541
Hi. We're swimmers,
and we need training twice a day.

1:32:29.625 --> 1:32:31.541
We'd like to swim for your club.

1:32:32.166 --> 1:32:33.125
Please.

1:32:33.208 --> 1:32:34.791
I'm sorry. What?

1:32:34.875 --> 1:32:37.291
We both swam for our country, in Syria,

1:32:37.375 --> 1:32:39.416
and I even competed
in the world championship.

1:32:39.500 --> 1:32:41.208
I went to Russia, and…

1:32:41.291 --> 1:32:42.958
This is a real swimming club, yes?

1:32:43.041 --> 1:32:45.250
I mean, people train
to be professional here?

1:32:45.333 --> 1:32:48.708
Because I wanna go to the Olympics.
My father was training us.

1:32:49.291 --> 1:32:52.625
-I wish I could help. The club is full.
-I told them already.

1:32:52.708 --> 1:32:55.458
-Yeah, have a good day.
-Have a nice day. Thank you.

1:32:56.583 --> 1:32:59.750
Wait. I swim 200m freestyle in 2.12

1:32:59.833 --> 1:33:02.291
and the 100m butterfly in 1.09.

1:33:02.875 --> 1:33:04.541
-Butterfly in 1.09?
-Yes.

1:33:05.333 --> 1:33:07.833
-She kidding?
-No, no. She swims. She swims.

1:33:09.416 --> 1:33:10.291
OK.

1:33:12.333 --> 1:33:15.375
OK, I have a small break
before my eleven o'clock session,

1:33:15.458 --> 1:33:17.958
so in the indoor pool if you're quick.

1:33:18.041 --> 1:33:19.916
Thank you.

1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:21.000
OK.

1:33:21.083 --> 1:33:23.166
But I don't have swimsuit.

1:33:25.083 --> 1:33:26.583
You don't have a swimsuit?

1:33:27.666 --> 1:33:28.708
And goggles.

1:33:31.125 --> 1:33:33.875
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-OK. Yes, you're welcome.

1:33:33.958 --> 1:33:34.875
Let's go.

1:33:36.208 --> 1:33:37.250
Hey, hey.

1:33:37.333 --> 1:33:38.416
What's your name?

1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:40.000
Yusra Mardini.

1:33:40.791 --> 1:33:42.000
Yeah, and I'm Sara.

1:33:42.583 --> 1:33:43.500
Who are you?

1:33:44.208 --> 1:33:45.041
Sven.

1:33:45.625 --> 1:33:46.708
Thank you, Sven.

1:33:47.208 --> 1:33:49.250
-Nice to meet you.
-Let's go, girls.

1:33:49.333 --> 1:33:51.750
-We've gotta swim now!

1:34:03.166 --> 1:34:04.000
OK.

1:34:04.583 --> 1:34:06.083
Ready, set--

1:34:07.708 --> 1:34:09.000
Sara!

1:34:38.625 --> 1:34:39.958
Why did you do that?

1:34:41.833 --> 1:34:43.583
Very good. You can both swim.

1:34:46.083 --> 1:34:49.666
<i>We have two training sessions</i>
<i>every day except Sunday.</i>

1:34:54.458 --> 1:34:55.541
Yep, this one.

1:34:56.541 --> 1:34:57.750
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

1:34:57.833 --> 1:35:02.125
<i>If you think you might be suffering</i>
<i>from post-traumatic stress disorder</i>

1:35:02.208 --> 1:35:05.625
<i>or would like to discuss</i>
<i>your mental health with a professional,</i>

1:35:05.708 --> 1:35:08.958
<i>a nurse will be available</i>
<i>on Saturday mornings in hangar five.</i>

1:35:09.041 --> 1:35:10.916
Thank you so much for all this.

1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:14.458
Yeah, you're welcome.
It's just whatever I could get.

1:35:15.416 --> 1:35:17.458
But if you're serious,
we need to go shopping,

1:35:17.541 --> 1:35:19.166
find you things that properly fit.

1:35:19.250 --> 1:35:20.875
You don't think I'm a serious swimmer?

1:35:23.083 --> 1:35:25.041
I want you to write
to the Syrian national team.

1:35:25.125 --> 1:35:27.500
-He's done enough.
-I want you to tell them my times.

1:35:27.583 --> 1:35:29.916
I don't want them to think
I'm not training for the Olympics<i>,</i>

1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.041
so please tell them I'll be ready for Rio.

1:35:32.125 --> 1:35:37.625
OK. But there are some local swim meets
I want us to aim for first. OK?

1:35:40.625 --> 1:35:44.000
OK. Uh…
How do you sleep with all this noise?

1:35:45.583 --> 1:35:46.583
We don't.

1:35:59.666 --> 1:36:03.125
Yusra told me what happened,
about you swimming across the Greek sea.

1:36:03.791 --> 1:36:06.708
Hey, you both deserve a medal for that.

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.083
Yeah, but we weren't the only ones.

1:36:11.875 --> 1:36:12.791
Just, um…

1:36:13.625 --> 1:36:16.833
We're actually pretty lucky we survived.
Many don't.

1:36:17.416 --> 1:36:18.333
So…

1:36:19.625 --> 1:36:20.958
Nah, I don't want a medal.

1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:24.583
I'm… I'm sorry.

1:36:26.125 --> 1:36:29.208
Hey. Yusra, here.
This is your room.

1:36:29.291 --> 1:36:30.458
You're so kind.

1:36:30.541 --> 1:36:34.625
The club management said you can use it
until your papers come through.

1:36:34.708 --> 1:36:35.916
Thank you.

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.500
It's not much, I know,
but no visiting teams.

1:36:38.583 --> 1:36:41.500
But at least it's quiet.
And it's close to the pool.

1:36:41.583 --> 1:36:42.625
This is amazing.

1:36:42.708 --> 1:36:46.916
And I'm your guarantor, so no parties, OK?

1:36:47.416 --> 1:36:49.500
-Or I get in trouble.

1:36:49.583 --> 1:36:52.791
OK, settle in,
then we're gonna see us for training.

1:36:52.875 --> 1:36:53.958
Thank you so much.

1:36:54.041 --> 1:36:55.208
-Welcome.
-See you.

1:36:56.375 --> 1:36:57.625
Yeah!

1:37:07.125 --> 1:37:08.833
<i>OK, come.</i>

1:37:14.458 --> 1:37:15.708
You need a break.

1:37:15.791 --> 1:37:18.708
-No.
-It's not a question. Take a break.

1:37:20.541 --> 1:37:21.375
Sara.

1:37:26.166 --> 1:37:29.583
My shoulder…

1:37:33.666 --> 1:37:34.916
Mmm.

1:37:35.541 --> 1:37:37.666
It's always the swimming sisters.

1:37:38.291 --> 1:37:41.291
The sisters did this.
The sisters did that.

1:37:41.375 --> 1:37:42.750
The sisters won this.

1:37:42.833 --> 1:37:44.500
The sisters won that.

1:37:45.625 --> 1:37:48.625
I still have to sleep
with five strangers in a room.

1:37:48.708 --> 1:37:51.166
Oh, stop it, Nizar. Eat something.

1:37:51.250 --> 1:37:53.791
We don't like you
being stuck there either.

1:37:53.875 --> 1:37:55.416
But if only you could swim.

1:37:59.375 --> 1:38:00.333
Exactly.

1:38:01.750 --> 1:38:03.291
If only I could swim.

1:38:04.791 --> 1:38:06.541
I can't do anything here.

1:38:06.625 --> 1:38:09.625
And I'm not allowed to work
until I get my papers.

1:38:11.083 --> 1:38:14.166
I wish I never agreed with you
to come here.

1:38:14.750 --> 1:38:18.208
Even if you're one of the lucky ones
and you actually make it,

1:38:18.291 --> 1:38:23.291
there's nothing here to come for, nothing,
except waiting and paperwork.

1:38:26.083 --> 1:38:27.750
Unless you are the Mardini sisters.

1:38:35.791 --> 1:38:37.666
My times are better back home.

1:38:38.333 --> 1:38:41.000
You had to escape a war.
Of course it will set you back.

1:38:45.416 --> 1:38:46.833
You tried, right?

1:38:47.458 --> 1:38:48.500
For the Olympics.

1:38:50.583 --> 1:38:54.000
-I saw your pictures on the wall.
-Yeah. Yeah, I tried.

1:38:55.041 --> 1:38:58.333
And why didn't you succeed?
Was it talent or discipline?

1:39:01.041 --> 1:39:01.916
It, um…

1:39:03.541 --> 1:39:06.791
OK, I think
it's not always so black and white.

1:39:06.875 --> 1:39:07.708
Um…

1:39:09.416 --> 1:39:10.958
I didn't believe in myself.

1:39:13.083 --> 1:39:16.000
I was swimming to avoid losing,
not to win.

1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.875
Hey, you need to give yourself a break.
Stop being so hard on yourself, OK?

1:39:23.958 --> 1:39:25.041
Get some rest.

1:39:25.125 --> 1:39:26.208
-Rest?
-Yeah.

1:39:26.750 --> 1:39:28.166
And what about Rio?

1:39:31.916 --> 1:39:33.791
OK. How do I say this? Um…

1:39:33.875 --> 1:39:35.958
Yusra, um…

1:39:36.041 --> 1:39:38.416
It's fantastic that you have dreams,

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.458
but we need to be realistic.
I want to keep working with you,

1:39:43.541 --> 1:39:45.833
but you're not going to be
swimming for Syria.

1:39:47.916 --> 1:39:49.583
You're not gonna make it to Rio.

1:39:51.166 --> 1:39:52.333
I'm sorry.

1:39:53.500 --> 1:39:57.250
There are other competitions
we can focus on. We can focus on…

1:39:58.375 --> 1:39:59.250
Yusra.

1:40:00.541 --> 1:40:03.666
Yusra. Hey, it's step-by-step.

1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:06.833
Yusra, that's not your session!

1:40:40.625 --> 1:40:43.416
-You forgot evening training.
-Yeah, I was busy.

1:40:43.500 --> 1:40:47.583
Busy partying with friends?
You know it's disrespectful to Sven.

1:40:47.666 --> 1:40:49.916
You need to tell him
instead of not showing up.

1:40:55.041 --> 1:40:58.250
Do you realize
that neither of us chose to swim?

1:41:00.125 --> 1:41:03.500
-Do you remember starting?
-I remember us loving swimming.

1:41:05.666 --> 1:41:08.750
If we're not here to do our best,
why did we bother coming?

1:41:08.833 --> 1:41:12.833
Maybe it's not as easy being here
for everyone else as it is for you.

1:41:19.750 --> 1:41:22.291
FOREIGNERS OUT

1:41:22.375 --> 1:41:23.250
Nizar.

1:41:23.333 --> 1:41:25.291
You can't be on Arab time here.

1:41:26.791 --> 1:41:28.500
-Sorry. Sorry.
-It's been one hour!

1:41:28.583 --> 1:41:29.916
I'm not sleeping well.

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.541
-No?
-Nizar! Sara!

1:41:34.041 --> 1:41:35.916
-Nizar!
-Oh, Emad!

1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.916
-No, you can't come through here.
-We're coming.

1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:40.250
-We're coming.
-OK.

1:41:42.083 --> 1:41:43.583
How are we gonna pass?

1:41:44.375 --> 1:41:45.416
I'm sorry.

1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:47.500
-OK, sorry.
-Come!

1:41:47.583 --> 1:41:49.041
-Sorry.
-Come!

1:41:49.125 --> 1:41:51.250
Nizar, here. Sorry, they're my friends.

1:41:51.333 --> 1:41:52.583
-Sorry, sorry.
<i>-Yalla.</i>

1:41:52.666 --> 1:41:53.958
This way. Sorry.

1:41:57.250 --> 1:42:00.291
-Sorry.
-How are you? I can't believe you're here.

1:42:00.375 --> 1:42:02.791
-Yes, I'm here.
-Sorry. Sorry. Hey, Emad!

1:42:04.375 --> 1:42:06.250
-How are you?
-I miss you, man. Oh my God.

1:42:06.333 --> 1:42:08.333
You look like a pop star, man.

1:42:08.416 --> 1:42:10.500
-What is this?
-This is pop star.

1:42:10.583 --> 1:42:11.708
You look like refugee.

1:42:12.541 --> 1:42:14.000
-Good to see you.
-I miss you.

1:42:14.083 --> 1:42:16.958
-You look great. How are you?
-I'm good.

1:42:17.041 --> 1:42:19.166
How's everything? How's everyone?

1:42:19.250 --> 1:42:20.500
The others?

1:42:20.583 --> 1:42:22.833
No, the others
were turned back at the border.

1:42:22.916 --> 1:42:25.750
-What?
-There was nobody there to help us cross.

1:42:25.833 --> 1:42:27.375
So we had to run,

1:42:27.958 --> 1:42:31.458
and everybody split up.
I didn't see them again.

1:42:32.041 --> 1:42:33.333
God, that's awful.

1:42:34.916 --> 1:42:35.750
Yeah.

1:42:38.875 --> 1:42:41.416
Your asylum request
has now been registered.

1:42:41.500 --> 1:42:45.416
You will receive a certificate
for temporary permission to reside

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:47.875
until your application has been processed.

1:42:47.958 --> 1:42:50.916
That's it?
You don't have to ask questions?

1:42:51.583 --> 1:42:53.708
Why we left Syria, anything?

1:42:53.791 --> 1:42:56.666
You will be contacted
for an interview in a few months.

1:42:58.083 --> 1:43:01.708
Yeah, but how long until we know
whether it's been successful or no?

1:43:01.791 --> 1:43:06.041
We have a lot of people to process.
It's currently taking a year or two.

1:43:07.500 --> 1:43:10.708
Yeah, but we need to apply also
for the family reunion.

1:43:10.791 --> 1:43:12.708
My sister Yusra is still 17.

1:43:23.041 --> 1:43:23.916
Yeah.

1:43:24.916 --> 1:43:27.666
Your sister will be 18 in March.

1:43:28.833 --> 1:43:30.458
That's not enough time.

1:43:31.750 --> 1:43:35.500
We require a minimum of six months
for family reunion.

1:43:37.166 --> 1:43:40.458
Yeah, but my younger sister
and my parents are still in Damascus.

1:43:43.875 --> 1:43:46.250
It's very dangerous.
They have to come here.

1:43:46.791 --> 1:43:48.208
Syria's being bombed.

1:43:52.750 --> 1:43:53.750
I'm sorry.

1:43:55.666 --> 1:43:56.541
Please.

1:43:59.958 --> 1:44:01.125
There's nothing I can do.

1:44:19.750 --> 1:44:20.708
<i>Yusra.</i>

1:44:22.916 --> 1:44:24.375
<i>Yusra, please.</i>

1:44:28.958 --> 1:44:30.458
<i>It's a processing thing.</i>

1:44:32.958 --> 1:44:35.458
So, they have to come the same way we did?

1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:39.541
We should never have left.

1:44:39.625 --> 1:44:42.291
I lost vital training.
My swimming is shit.

1:44:43.125 --> 1:44:44.875
That's all you care about? Swimming?

1:44:46.625 --> 1:44:48.291
Think you're being selfish?

1:44:48.375 --> 1:44:52.333
Selfish? I'm selfish?
Mama, Baba, and Shahed are in my heart.

1:44:53.458 --> 1:44:57.208
I keep thinking about them.
But you don't, you just carry on.

1:44:57.291 --> 1:45:00.625
You're reckless.
They're in danger now because of you.

1:45:00.708 --> 1:45:03.875
-You can talk.
-What?

1:45:03.958 --> 1:45:05.625
At least I have a goal.

1:45:05.708 --> 1:45:07.375
What are you doing here?

1:45:07.458 --> 1:45:09.875
You try to be cool
and waste your time partying.

1:45:10.750 --> 1:45:11.916
I don't know you anymore.

1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.375
You're not swimming.
You're not doing anything.

1:45:14.458 --> 1:45:16.583
You're never going to achieve anything.

1:45:20.291 --> 1:45:21.916
Right, OK.

1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:23.250
You missed the second turn.

1:45:23.333 --> 1:45:26.458
Your frequency was too slow
in the last 25 meters. What's wrong?

1:45:26.541 --> 1:45:27.583
Nothing.

1:45:29.625 --> 1:45:31.041
-Sure?
-Yes.

1:45:32.333 --> 1:45:34.958
OK. I wanted to tell you later,

1:45:36.041 --> 1:45:38.833
but I have something
that will make you smile.

1:45:39.500 --> 1:45:40.333
What?

1:45:40.416 --> 1:45:42.375
I heard
the International Olympic Committee

1:45:42.458 --> 1:45:46.125
gave a press conference, and they were
announcing help for refugee athletes.

1:45:46.208 --> 1:45:49.583
They're forming a refugee team for Rio.

1:45:49.666 --> 1:45:51.000
OK.

1:45:51.083 --> 1:45:55.000
I sent them your times and told them
about your swim across the sea,

1:45:55.083 --> 1:45:58.333
and, hey, if we work hard
and your times improve,

1:45:58.416 --> 1:46:00.000
you can get onto the team.

1:46:04.666 --> 1:46:05.583
What?

1:46:06.833 --> 1:46:09.708
If you had the chance,
would you want to compete

1:46:09.791 --> 1:46:13.791
because you were good enough
or because people felt sorry for you?

1:46:15.666 --> 1:46:18.458
I want to go to the Olympics
more than anything.

1:46:19.708 --> 1:46:23.458
But when I go,
I will be there swimming for my country.

1:46:37.541 --> 1:46:38.458
I'm sorry.

1:46:39.041 --> 1:46:40.958
About what I said last night.

1:46:42.041 --> 1:46:43.166
You meant it.

1:46:49.375 --> 1:46:50.875
Not in the way I said it.

1:46:52.541 --> 1:46:55.916
You're so soft on the outside.
So hard underneath.

1:46:58.208 --> 1:47:00.375
But I kind of admire this about you.

1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:04.708
I'm so happy you're swimming.

1:47:08.916 --> 1:47:10.541
Sven called, by the way.

1:47:11.791 --> 1:47:13.166
About the refugee team.

1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:15.250
You should do it.

1:47:18.083 --> 1:47:20.166
This was everything you ever wanted.

1:47:22.166 --> 1:47:23.875
Not in the way I want it.

1:47:23.958 --> 1:47:27.083
Yeah, but nothing has been
the way we wanted it.

1:47:28.166 --> 1:47:29.958
Why would this be any different?

1:47:32.125 --> 1:47:34.000
I want to swim for Syria.

1:47:35.708 --> 1:47:36.583
No.

1:47:36.666 --> 1:47:38.541
That's what Baba wanted.

1:47:44.166 --> 1:47:46.916
Baba ever tell you
why he stopped swimming for Syria?

1:47:49.375 --> 1:47:50.833
Military service.

1:47:55.791 --> 1:47:57.125
He was actually very good.

1:47:57.208 --> 1:48:00.166
At the beginning,
I thought it was an excuse, but it wasn't.

1:48:01.250 --> 1:48:05.791
And he had to lose two years of training
just to carry a gun.

1:48:08.583 --> 1:48:09.875
Life is not fair.

1:48:13.500 --> 1:48:15.125
I'm Sara Mardini.

1:48:16.875 --> 1:48:18.500
I have no country anymore.

1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.666
This might be
the only opportunity of your life.

1:48:26.958 --> 1:48:27.958
Look at me.

1:48:29.416 --> 1:48:31.291
Don't be stupid. Take it.

1:48:54.041 --> 1:48:56.250
Oh, I was looking for you.

1:48:57.583 --> 1:49:00.041
I wanted to go to the Olympics
for Team Syria,

1:49:00.125 --> 1:49:02.750
but if I can't,
I'd like to swim for Team Sven.

1:49:02.833 --> 1:49:04.166
If you still want me to,

1:49:04.250 --> 1:49:06.916
even though I'm stupid,
and I don't deserve it.

1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:12.791
For 2020, we will train for Syria,
but for 2016, I'm Team Refugee.

1:49:14.916 --> 1:49:16.583
We have a lot of work to do.

1:49:17.708 --> 1:49:18.541
Ready?

1:49:26.833 --> 1:49:28.916
<i>Tell me about your training.</i>

1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:30.125
<i>Of course, Baba.</i>

1:49:32.958 --> 1:49:35.083
<i>I want you to describe</i>
<i>every detail.</i>

1:49:36.541 --> 1:49:38.041
<i>The feeling underwater.</i>

1:49:39.208 --> 1:49:41.583
<i>Every stroke, every move you make.</i>

1:49:48.625 --> 1:49:51.083
<i> I want to know</i>
<i>what this German has done.</i>

1:49:51.833 --> 1:49:54.541
That was kind of "flop-flop."
No, you have to…

1:50:20.291 --> 1:50:22.708
The head is too high. Focus on the elbow.

1:50:23.458 --> 1:50:24.291
OK?

1:50:43.500 --> 1:50:44.625
What was my time?

1:50:44.708 --> 1:50:45.666
Sven?

1:50:45.750 --> 1:50:47.166
What was my time?

1:50:47.750 --> 1:50:49.666
-We're going to Rio.
-No.

1:50:50.291 --> 1:50:52.666
-We're going to Rio.
-We're going to Rio?

1:50:54.416 --> 1:50:55.916
We're going to Rio!

1:51:03.166 --> 1:51:07.250
-Hey! We are going to Rio!

1:51:16.083 --> 1:51:18.666
But I can't stop thinking about them.

1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.208
I saw on Facebook that 100,000 people

1:51:24.291 --> 1:51:27.416
had to cross the sea to Greece
in the last two months.

1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.458
You know,
what we've been through isn't special.

1:51:32.625 --> 1:51:33.541
Well…

1:51:34.791 --> 1:51:36.250
What I saw on Facebook

1:51:36.333 --> 1:51:38.125
was this place in Sonnenallee

1:51:38.708 --> 1:51:40.583
run by this guy from Damascus.

1:51:40.666 --> 1:51:44.250
He makes the same whipped ice cream
that he made back there.

1:51:45.333 --> 1:51:46.500
We should try it.

1:51:50.208 --> 1:51:52.041
<i>An Olympian,</i>
<i>my own daughter.</i>

1:51:52.125 --> 1:51:54.250
<i>An Olympian, I don't believe it.</i>

1:51:54.333 --> 1:51:56.708
All that time at the poolside
wasn't for nothing.

1:51:56.791 --> 1:51:59.083
<i>It's good. It's as it should be.</i>

1:51:59.833 --> 1:52:02.291
<i>And Sara? You didn't have the times?</i>

1:52:03.583 --> 1:52:05.041
<i>Even for this refugee team?</i>

1:52:05.125 --> 1:52:06.583
No, Baba. I didn't.

1:52:07.583 --> 1:52:10.583
"Refugee team"?
You say it like it doesn't count.

1:52:47.666 --> 1:52:49.000
Nice tracksuit.

1:52:49.083 --> 1:52:51.708
-What have you done?
-It's good at the back?

1:52:52.250 --> 1:52:53.375
It's beautiful.

1:52:53.458 --> 1:52:55.291
I always wanted it short.

1:52:56.541 --> 1:52:57.375
Look.

1:52:58.000 --> 1:52:59.458
I wanna tell you something.

1:53:01.208 --> 1:53:02.250
I've decided…

1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:06.625
I'm going back to Lesbos.

1:53:08.083 --> 1:53:09.000
What?

1:53:09.666 --> 1:53:13.000
I found this organization,
and I've been emailing them,

1:53:13.083 --> 1:53:15.416
and they help everyone who's crossing.

1:53:16.625 --> 1:53:19.541
-I want to be part of this.
-No, Sara, please.

1:53:19.625 --> 1:53:21.750
We need to move on, go forward.

1:53:22.333 --> 1:53:25.958
-What are you doing?
-I need to be there. To help everyone.

1:53:26.041 --> 1:53:29.500
Give them water, shoes,
everything we didn't have.

1:53:30.875 --> 1:53:34.041
You know, Mama, Shahed, Baba
will come the same way, maybe.

1:53:39.500 --> 1:53:41.166
So you won't come with me to Rio?

1:53:44.416 --> 1:53:47.541
Look, you were right.
I've never done anything with my life.

1:53:48.750 --> 1:53:51.000
This is the first time I feel this.

1:53:52.916 --> 1:53:54.250
Look, you can move on.

1:53:54.833 --> 1:53:56.458
You can become an Olympian.

1:53:57.041 --> 1:53:57.958
I can't.

1:54:02.375 --> 1:54:04.291
This is the right thing for me.

1:54:17.958 --> 1:54:18.791
Nizar.

1:54:20.833 --> 1:54:22.083
What's this?

1:54:22.166 --> 1:54:24.416
I was going to wait
for your birthday.

1:54:24.500 --> 1:54:26.375
Happy early birthday!

1:54:28.333 --> 1:54:29.958
You remembered my birthday?

1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:32.875
You're not allowed to give up.

1:54:39.666 --> 1:54:42.125
-Thank you.
-No, thank you.

1:54:46.166 --> 1:54:48.250
Maybe you <i>are </i>my favorite cousin.

1:54:48.333 --> 1:54:51.000
I don't believe you.
You said this to Sara last week, so…

1:54:51.083 --> 1:54:55.083
I think I'll get going.
I'll leave you prepare your stuff.

1:54:58.916 --> 1:55:01.958
Uh…
You've made us walk taller.

1:55:03.666 --> 1:55:05.208
Don't worry about winning.

1:55:06.958 --> 1:55:08.375
I am so proud of you.

1:55:21.333 --> 1:55:22.208
Peace.

1:55:25.500 --> 1:55:26.583
Bye.

1:55:38.458 --> 1:55:40.541
<i>Next stop,</i>
<i>the Olympic Village.</i>

1:55:44.166 --> 1:55:46.416
<i>Welcome to Rio de Janeiro.</i>

1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:52.500
<i>11,238 athletes from 207 nations</i>

1:56:01.875 --> 1:56:02.708
Thank you.

1:56:02.791 --> 1:56:05.083
-What's that?
-I don't know!

1:56:05.166 --> 1:56:08.333
<i>But one new team</i>
<i>has been generating a special buzz.</i>

1:56:08.833 --> 1:56:10.333
<i>The Refugee Olympic Team.</i>

1:56:11.083 --> 1:56:13.500
-So, Yusra, welcome to Rio.
-Thank you.

1:56:15.166 --> 1:56:17.791
-Oh my God, that's David Rudisha.
-Who?

1:56:17.875 --> 1:56:19.291
Don't you know anybody?

1:56:22.375 --> 1:56:25.500
I've been swimming since I was a kid.

1:56:25.583 --> 1:56:27.625
#2016.

1:56:28.666 --> 1:56:32.375
<i>Welcome to the world-famous</i>
<i>Maracanã Stadium</i>

1:56:32.458 --> 1:56:36.500
<i>in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,</i>
<i>for the opening ceremony.</i>

1:56:36.583 --> 1:56:39.750
<i>They have traveled</i>

1:56:39.833 --> 1:56:43.250
<i>and have spent a lifetime</i>

1:56:43.333 --> 1:56:47.041
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1:56:47.916 --> 1:56:50.916
<i>We welcome</i>

1:56:55.625 --> 1:56:57.833
<i>A journey</i>

<i>all the way from Greece to Rio.</i>

1:57:17.375 --> 1:57:21.708
Refugees!

1:57:28.666 --> 1:57:29.500
Sara!

1:57:39.750 --> 1:57:41.125
Sara!

1:57:55.458 --> 1:57:58.125
Sara!

1:58:16.708 --> 1:58:21.333
<i>I want to know, for everyone out there,</i>
<i>what's been your main motivation…</i>

1:58:21.416 --> 1:58:24.000
That's the Syrian girl
that's racing today.

1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:27.625
I mean, I'm all for charity, but…

1:58:27.708 --> 1:58:30.916
Exactly. The rest of us
had to work to be here.

1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:33.583
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it's such an honor to be part of it.</i>

1:58:33.666 --> 1:58:38.125
<i>It's a chance to be a voice</i>
<i>and to give hope.</i>

1:58:45.750 --> 1:58:46.583
Hi.

1:58:46.666 --> 1:58:48.583
<i>So, aren't you</i>
<i>about to swim your race?</i>

1:58:48.666 --> 1:58:51.250
-Yes.
<i>-What are you doing sitting on your ass?</i>

1:58:52.041 --> 1:58:53.041
How do you--

1:58:56.250 --> 1:58:58.625
I can't believe you're here!

1:58:59.375 --> 1:59:00.750
This is crazy!

1:59:01.625 --> 1:59:02.500
Sister.

1:59:06.458 --> 1:59:08.041
How did you get here?

1:59:08.125 --> 1:59:10.708
I contacted the sponsor
of the refugee team,

1:59:10.791 --> 1:59:15.625
and I told them that I was the sister
of the world-famous Yusra Mardini.

1:59:15.708 --> 1:59:18.250
-And I even flew business class.
-What?!

1:59:18.333 --> 1:59:21.083
-We were in economy.
-I don't fly economy, <i>habibi.</i>

1:59:24.916 --> 1:59:28.583
-And what about Lesbos?
-I'm gonna go straight after.

1:59:32.291 --> 1:59:34.041
I wanna show you something.

1:59:36.708 --> 1:59:40.541
<i>Good luck, my love.</i>
<i>I'm not worried because you're lucky.</i>

1:59:40.625 --> 1:59:44.333
<i>Luck has nothing to do with it.</i>
<i>Remember everything I've taught you.</i>

1:59:44.416 --> 1:59:45.833
Yalla, <i>Shahed.</i>

1:59:45.916 --> 1:59:47.083
<i>I hope you win.</i>

1:59:48.541 --> 1:59:51.916
<i>Good luck, Yusra.</i>
<i>We love you. We miss you.</i>

1:59:54.291 --> 1:59:55.625
So grown-up!

1:59:56.500 --> 1:59:57.333
<i>Good luck.</i>

1:59:57.416 --> 1:59:59.833
Actually, I didn't really
wanna show you this one.

1:59:59.916 --> 2:00:03.000
Why? Is she back in Eritrea?

2:00:05.250 --> 2:00:06.208
Hm.

2:00:07.125 --> 2:00:08.375
Is she safe?

2:00:19.875 --> 2:00:21.875
I heard other swimmers talking.

2:00:24.333 --> 2:00:26.250
They said I shouldn't be here.

2:00:27.916 --> 2:00:29.833
They said I don't deserve it.

2:00:29.916 --> 2:00:32.583
Well, they're right. You shouldn't.

2:00:34.250 --> 2:00:36.625
You should be
at the bottom of the Greek sea.

2:00:38.125 --> 2:00:41.333
Or sleeping on the roadside of <i>Hungaria.</i>

2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.750
Or you should be dead
in a hole in Dariyya.

2:00:46.625 --> 2:00:48.291
I just wanna be a swimmer.

2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:52.291
You know Olympians are people
who are supposed to do amazing things.

2:00:53.833 --> 2:00:54.875
Don't do that.

2:00:55.375 --> 2:00:57.208
Remember what Baba used to say?

2:00:58.291 --> 2:01:00.500
"Find your lane. Swim your race."

2:01:01.458 --> 2:01:02.916
It's all bullshit.

2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.541
<i>Please welcome</i>
<i>the athletes in heat one</i>

2:01:05.625 --> 2:01:08.250
<i>of the women's 100m butterfly.</i>

2:01:08.333 --> 2:01:10.250
<i>You should swim for all of us.</i>

2:01:20.416 --> 2:01:21.916
<i>You should swim for Baba</i>

2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:23.125
because he didn't.

2:01:27.125 --> 2:01:28.250
<i>Swim for me</i>

2:01:29.458 --> 2:01:30.500
because I couldn't.

2:01:33.083 --> 2:01:35.375
<i>Swim for Sven because he couldn't.</i>

2:01:37.625 --> 2:01:38.875
Swim for Shada.

2:01:41.750 --> 2:01:43.916
Swim for Razan Haddad.

2:01:44.666 --> 2:01:49.083
<i>Swimming for Qatar</i>
<i>in lane two, Nada Arakji.</i>

2:01:49.750 --> 2:01:53.000
And for everyone who died
trying to find a new life.

2:01:57.333 --> 2:01:58.666
Swim for them.

2:01:58.750 --> 2:02:03.625
<i>Swimming in lane three</i>
<i>for Rwanda, Johanna Umurungi.</i>

2:02:05.750 --> 2:02:07.958
You're so much more than an Olympian.

2:02:09.416 --> 2:02:13.000
<i>Swimming in lane four</i>
<i>for the Refugee Olympic Team,</i>

2:02:13.083 --> 2:02:15.750
<i>Yusra Mardini.</i>

2:02:55.458 --> 2:02:57.041
<i>Take your marks.</i>

2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:17.458
-Yusra, go!
-Faster!

2:04:43.041 --> 2:04:45.041
Come! Come! Come! Come! Come!

2:04:48.125 --> 2:04:49.750
Come! Come! Come! Come!

2:04:56.916 --> 2:04:57.875
Yeah!

2:05:03.250 --> 2:05:04.916
Yusra!

2:05:09.166 --> 2:05:12.291
Yeah! Yeah!

2:05:15.666 --> 2:05:17.666
Yeah!

2:05:52.083 --> 2:05:54.375
-Are you racing me?
-Are we racing?

2:05:54.458 --> 2:05:56.541
<i>…finals will begin in 15 minutes…</i>

2:05:59.041 --> 2:06:00.541
Sara, please, I'm tired.

2:06:00.625 --> 2:06:03.333
-No one's forcing you to race.
-I hate you.

2:06:03.416 --> 2:06:05.333
You love me!

2:06:05.833 --> 2:06:07.083
Kiss my Olympic ass.

2:06:07.166 --> 2:06:09.166
I'm gonna kick your Olympic ass!

2:06:14.875 --> 2:06:17.541
No! No!
