00:00.271 --> 00:01.520
<i>Previously on</i> The Fosters...

00:01.535 --> 00:02.400
Brandon: We found our Romeo.

00:02.436 --> 00:04.135
All we need to do is find our Juliet.

00:04.171 --> 00:05.203
Mat: I don't want you in my musical,

00:05.238 --> 00:07.205
but you were hands down the best.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.367
Privatization is incredibly effective.

00:09.386 --> 00:11.269
We can get so much more done.

00:11.321 --> 00:13.204
This is Callie, my sister.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.240
Cortney: She's the girl you
loved and couldn't be with.

00:15.275 --> 00:16.574
Stef: She's trying to help Gabe get off

00:16.610 --> 00:17.625
the sex offender registry.

00:17.661 --> 00:19.477
He's on that list because of me.

00:19.513 --> 00:21.479
Talked to a lawyer and she
said it was almost impossible.

00:21.515 --> 00:24.382
I had cancer and I had to have
both of my breasts removed.

00:25.785 --> 00:26.884
Since I met Daphne,

00:26.920 --> 00:28.853
all she's talked about is
getting her daughter back.

00:29.188 --> 00:31.756
She was a role model at Girls United

00:31.791 --> 00:33.658
and she really worked the program

00:33.693 --> 00:35.693
and got her high school diploma.

00:35.728 --> 00:37.628
She's a good friend and a good person.

00:38.698 --> 00:40.998
She's made some mistakes,

00:41.034 --> 00:42.600
but she's taken responsibility for them

00:42.635 --> 00:44.952
and she's worked really
hard to turn her life around

00:45.004 --> 00:46.571
for her daughter.

00:47.941 --> 00:49.991
I'm... I'm sure both of
you have done a great job

00:50.026 --> 00:52.844
taking care of Tasha, and...
and I think it's wonderful

00:52.879 --> 00:53.845
that you want to adopt her.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.847
I was a foster kid and I got adopted,

00:55.882 --> 00:58.749
and I have an amazing family now.

01:01.688 --> 01:04.721
But if my mother were alive and...

01:04.757 --> 01:06.657
she wanted to raise me...

01:07.760 --> 01:09.694
I'd want to be with her.

01:09.729 --> 01:13.531
I think if a foster kid
has a biological parent

01:13.566 --> 01:15.700
who loves them and
can take care of them,

01:15.735 --> 01:17.602
they deserve a chance.

01:17.637 --> 01:19.504
And at what cost to the child?

01:19.539 --> 01:20.588
If she can't take care of her.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.907
I understand that this is very emotional

01:22.942 --> 01:24.876
for both parties, but let's...

01:24.911 --> 01:26.844
not speak out of turn.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.979
Thank you, Callie.

01:28.014 --> 01:30.982
Daphne obviously has a
good friend in you as well.

01:31.017 --> 01:34.852
Your Honor, can I ask
Callie a few questions?

01:34.888 --> 01:35.920
Judge: Go ahead.

01:35.955 --> 01:40.808
Callie, didn't your good
friend Daphne beat you up

01:40.860 --> 01:42.827
in juvenile detention?

01:42.829 --> 01:45.796
Well, that was before we
really knew each other.

01:45.832 --> 01:47.782
So, you were a total stranger
when she assaulted you?

01:47.817 --> 01:50.601
She's not that person anymore.

01:50.637 --> 01:52.603
Did you do anything to provoke her?

01:52.639 --> 01:53.871
No.

01:53.923 --> 01:56.674
So, Daphne's capable of striking
out randomly for no reason?

01:56.676 --> 01:58.676
No, I wouldn't say that,
and Daphne has changed.

01:58.711 --> 02:01.946
Yes, yes, she's graduated
from assault to kidnapping.

02:07.864 --> 02:09.714
So I'll meet you at the doctor's office?

02:09.765 --> 02:10.781
You don't have to come.

02:10.817 --> 02:12.733
They're just gonna pump
me up full of saline.

02:12.735 --> 02:14.836
Well, I know, but it's not nothing.

02:14.838 --> 02:16.671
It's emotional.

02:16.706 --> 02:17.772
I'm just not looking forward

02:17.807 --> 02:19.657
to being filled up like
a balloon every week.

02:19.709 --> 02:21.626
Should've done the implants
when they did the mastectomy.

02:21.661 --> 02:24.645
Well, it seemed like a lot
to go through all at once.

02:24.681 --> 02:26.664
Definitely not looking
forward to going under again.

02:26.699 --> 02:28.583
(sighs)

02:28.618 --> 02:29.684
Well, you know, you don't have to.

02:29.719 --> 02:31.519
I don't want to be awake for it.

02:31.571 --> 02:33.688
No, I mean have the surgery period.

02:36.559 --> 02:38.493
Well, then what would I do?

02:38.528 --> 02:40.578
You would just take the expanders out

02:40.630 --> 02:42.430
and be done with it.

02:42.465 --> 02:44.599
(chuckles) Oh, yeah, that would be...
that'd be great for our sex life.

02:44.601 --> 02:45.900
Why do you say that?

02:45.902 --> 02:49.470
I'm self-conscious
enough as it is, Lena.

02:49.506 --> 02:50.888
You know, about the way I... I look

02:50.940 --> 02:52.907
and not being touched, and...

02:52.942 --> 02:54.458
I certainly don't feel sexy.

02:55.762 --> 02:57.895
Well, you haven't fully
recovered yet either.

02:57.947 --> 02:59.814
It's...

02:59.816 --> 03:02.800
It would just take time to get
used to seeing yourself differently.

03:02.852 --> 03:04.685
Yeah? What about you?

03:04.721 --> 03:06.654
You think you'd get used to it?

03:06.656 --> 03:07.738
Still be attracted
to me without breasts?

03:07.790 --> 03:09.757
I'd have sex with you
right now if you wanted.

03:09.792 --> 03:11.726
Why? You wanna buy me dinner first?

03:11.728 --> 03:13.744
I'm just saying,

03:13.780 --> 03:15.663
it's not an issue for me.

03:15.715 --> 03:17.698
So then what would I do?

03:17.734 --> 03:20.535
Go get a prosthetic bra or something?

03:20.570 --> 03:21.669
If you wanted.

03:21.721 --> 03:23.521
- But you wouldn't even have to do that.
- (chuckles)

03:23.556 --> 03:24.605
Yeah, right.

03:24.641 --> 03:26.541
A cop with a flat chest. I
can hear the comments now.

03:26.593 --> 03:28.509
People already think I'm butch.

03:28.545 --> 03:30.511
- Who cares what they think?
- Yeah, well...

03:30.547 --> 03:31.495
(knocking)

03:31.531 --> 03:33.464
- Yeah?
- (door opens)

03:34.851 --> 03:36.784
Hey...

03:36.819 --> 03:39.854
Stef: Certainly hope you don't think
you're going anywhere in those shorts.

03:39.889 --> 03:41.722
- What's wrong with them?
- (Lena scoffs)

03:41.724 --> 03:43.891
Well, the only cheeks I want the
world to see are on your face.

03:43.927 --> 03:45.459
(chuckles)

03:45.511 --> 03:48.663
Oh, but it's okay for Jesus'
pants to be around his thighs?

03:48.698 --> 03:51.716
Uh, no. You need to put a
belt on or change those pants.

03:51.751 --> 03:53.634
Stef: What's that?

03:53.653 --> 03:55.570
Letters of support for Gabe to get off

03:55.605 --> 03:58.639
the sex offenders list
from Victor, Elena, and Ana.

03:58.675 --> 04:01.509
Victor and Elena? They wrote a letter...

04:01.544 --> 04:03.544
even after Ana showed up
to your party like she did?

04:03.580 --> 04:05.479
It wasn't Gabe's fault.

04:05.515 --> 04:07.481
Besides, Ana's going to,
like, two meetings a day.

04:07.533 --> 04:10.468
She wants to make it
right and so do we, so...

04:11.621 --> 04:13.487
we wrote letters too.

04:13.523 --> 04:14.855
You wrote a letter too?

04:14.891 --> 04:17.757
Even if he doesn't want
anything to do with us,

04:17.810 --> 04:19.777
it's unfair he's gotta live like this.

04:19.829 --> 04:21.428
Mariana: But since we can't give them

04:21.464 --> 04:24.732
to Gabe ourselves, we were
wondering if you could.

04:30.503 --> 04:33.471
Clearly, both parties
love this little girl

04:33.506 --> 04:35.406
and want to be a parent to her.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.542
The court is inclined
to reunify children

04:37.577 --> 04:40.478
with their birth
parents when appropriate.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.398
But in this case, I'm
not certain that it is.

04:44.434 --> 04:48.386
I would like to stay my custody ruling

04:48.421 --> 04:52.323
for another 30 days,
in which time Ms. Keene

04:52.358 --> 04:54.292
must prove she can
find gainful employment

04:54.327 --> 04:56.594
and provide financially for Tasha

04:56.629 --> 04:58.529
without any government aid.

Hey, this is good.

05:44.327 --> 05:46.244
She's giving you a chance.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.328
She ain't giving me no chance.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.664
She knows I can't get a job
that's gonna pay me enough

05:49.716 --> 05:52.250
to take care of me and
Tasha without food stamps.

05:52.382 --> 05:54.715
She's just covering her ass.

Well. Good. Fine.

06:32.789 --> 06:34.372
You don't know what
you're doing, do you?

06:34.374 --> 06:35.706
Brandon: Mariana.

06:37.377 --> 06:39.293
We need to rehearse. Come on.

06:39.345 --> 06:41.712
No, what we need is someone who
actually knows how to build a set.

06:41.714 --> 06:43.714
Look, it's fine, and
I got it under control.

06:43.766 --> 06:45.716
See? He has it under control. Let's go.

06:45.718 --> 06:46.717
(drilling, clattering)

06:46.769 --> 06:48.302
(people gasp and laugh)

06:48.354 --> 06:49.387
Ah, okay.

06:49.389 --> 06:51.389
Uh, it's cool. We're all good.

06:53.359 --> 06:56.360
See? That's going to be me
falling to my death opening night.

06:56.396 --> 06:57.645
Are you not worried?

06:57.697 --> 07:00.281
No, what I'm worried about
is the rest of the cast

07:00.316 --> 07:03.317
is off-book and killing
it except for my leads.

07:03.369 --> 07:05.286
- I'm off-book.
- Well, you're not killing it.

07:05.321 --> 07:07.705
Well, if Mat detached
himself from Zoey's face,

07:07.740 --> 07:09.323
maybe we could actually
get something done.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.242
Seriously, it's not too late to make

07:11.294 --> 07:12.326
a no cast and crew dating rule.

07:12.378 --> 07:15.629
Sure, and you can't date
James Dean over there.

07:15.665 --> 07:16.664
Whatever.

07:16.716 --> 07:18.716
At least I'm not
macking on Amy Winehouse.

07:18.751 --> 07:20.301
Okay, guys, you're
supposed to be in love.

07:20.336 --> 07:21.335
It's called acting.

07:21.387 --> 07:22.720
I don't know if the song's working.

07:22.755 --> 07:25.256
Maybe we might have to tweak
the lyrics of something.

07:25.308 --> 07:27.758
Is it my words or Shakespeare's
that you're not feeling?

07:27.760 --> 07:30.661
Well, it could be the fact that
Juliet is supposed to be a virgin,

07:30.697 --> 07:34.265
and our actress is singing
like she's Ariana Grande.

07:35.768 --> 07:37.685
I need a bathroom break.

07:40.406 --> 07:42.606
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

07:44.327 --> 07:47.278
What? I was just giving her
some constructive criticism.

07:48.698 --> 07:49.697
Hey.

07:51.334 --> 07:53.617
Look, I know that you and
Mariana have a history,

07:53.669 --> 07:55.669
but you broke up with her.

07:55.705 --> 07:56.787
How is this your business?

07:56.839 --> 08:00.624
Well, she's my girlfriend
and this is my warehouse.

08:00.626 --> 08:03.260
- Your daddy's warehouse.
- Which Nick is letting us use,

08:03.262 --> 08:04.261
so Mat, walk away.

08:04.297 --> 08:06.614
Mat, walk away.

08:08.584 --> 08:11.602
FYI, Mat had a good reason
to break up with Mariana.

08:11.654 --> 08:13.587
She cheated on him.

08:17.881 --> 08:18.411
Come in.

08:18.485 --> 08:20.110
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

08:22.270 --> 08:24.153
So is everything okay?

08:24.189 --> 08:26.038
Yeah, fine. I just...

08:26.040 --> 08:28.057
- Your address was all I had, so...
- What's this?

08:28.093 --> 08:31.077
Those are letters of support
from Ana and her parents

08:31.112 --> 08:33.044
as well as Jesus and Mariana.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.014
Jesus and Mariana?

08:35.049 --> 08:37.950
Yes. They would like to
help you get off the list.

08:37.986 --> 08:39.852
So...

08:40.989 --> 08:42.955
Do you... do you have any interest

08:42.957 --> 08:44.891
in getting to know the twins?

08:44.926 --> 08:47.260
It's fine if you don't.

08:47.295 --> 08:48.416
It's just I know that Jesus, for one,

08:48.417 --> 08:49.760
would like to get to know you better.

08:50.231 --> 08:52.281
I don't know how to be a parent.

08:52.317 --> 08:54.133
Well, he's not looking for a parent.

08:54.169 --> 08:55.301
He has parents.

08:57.155 --> 08:59.138
I would like to get to know him.

08:59.174 --> 09:01.140
And her.

09:01.142 --> 09:04.143
But, uh, I don't...

09:04.179 --> 09:07.029
really know what I have to offer.

09:08.993 --> 09:10.960
Thank you so much for doing this.

09:10.995 --> 09:12.812
You're really, really saving my life.

09:12.847 --> 09:14.764
I'm so behind on my senior project.

09:14.799 --> 09:15.915
- It's my pleasure.
- Great.

09:15.950 --> 09:17.834
Do you mind if I record this?

09:17.836 --> 09:18.835
Uh, no, no. Of course not.

09:18.887 --> 09:20.803
- (beep)
- All right, so...

09:20.805 --> 09:25.758
Tell me where you're from
and how you grew up, I guess.

09:25.810 --> 09:28.177
Well, I was raised
in Evanston, Illinois.

09:28.213 --> 09:30.113
Um, I'm an only child.

09:30.148 --> 09:34.067
Um, I grew up in a
middle class suburban home

09:34.119 --> 09:35.251
with two loving parents.

09:35.286 --> 09:38.087
So what got you
interested in foster care?

09:38.123 --> 09:40.957
Well, when I was about seven years old,

09:40.992 --> 09:44.927
a girl my age moved
in with our neighbors.

09:44.963 --> 09:46.963
Her name was Elizabeth, Lizzie,

09:46.998 --> 09:50.066
and she became my... my first BFF.

09:50.101 --> 09:53.970
I loved her so much that I
gave her my Mrs. Beasley doll.

09:53.972 --> 09:55.004
What's that?

09:55.039 --> 09:56.906
Well, it's from this TV
show when I was a kid.

09:56.941 --> 09:57.924
It's called <i> Family Affair.</i>

09:57.959 --> 09:59.876
And anyway, the youngest
girl had this doll

09:59.911 --> 10:00.943
that she'd call Mrs. Beasley,

10:00.945 --> 10:03.279
and, like, every girl in
America had to have one.

10:03.281 --> 10:04.797
(both laugh)

10:04.833 --> 10:06.182
So what happened to Lizzie?

10:06.234 --> 10:07.817
Did they adopt her?

10:07.869 --> 10:08.835
No.

10:08.870 --> 10:10.169
They wanted to.

10:11.306 --> 10:15.124
But one day Social Services
came and took her away.

10:15.126 --> 10:16.142
Why?

10:17.228 --> 10:20.029
Well, they placed her
back with her birth mom.

10:22.183 --> 10:25.001
Well, maybe she was better off.

10:25.036 --> 10:26.102
Not in this case.

10:27.939 --> 10:33.876
Lizzie's birth mom lost
custody again, and...

10:34.946 --> 10:37.296
she went back into the system.

10:37.348 --> 10:39.816
Then we lost track of her.

10:40.919 --> 10:42.251
That's awful.

10:42.253 --> 10:44.887
Yeah. You know what's
really awful? They...

10:44.923 --> 10:47.290
they wouldn't even let
her take Mrs. Beasley.

10:47.325 --> 10:50.126
I mean, they took her from a house

10:50.178 --> 10:54.163
where she was happy
and safe and loved...

10:58.069 --> 11:00.153
and they wouldn't even
let her take her doll.

11:00.205 --> 11:01.904
(sighs)

11:02.974 --> 11:04.857
(chuckles)

11:07.789 --> 11:08.971
(sighs) So, to answer your question,

11:09.007 --> 11:11.891
that is why I have dedicated my life

11:11.926 --> 11:13.826
to reform the system.

11:13.862 --> 11:16.179
For Lizzie and for kids like her.

11:17.766 --> 11:19.782
You are an amazing person.

11:19.834 --> 11:21.167
So are you.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.802
You're helping so many people

11:22.837 --> 11:25.738
by telling your story
and supporting this bill.

11:25.757 --> 11:28.107
I actually, um...

11:28.143 --> 11:31.127
I have a friend who needs help.

11:31.162 --> 11:33.179
She's got a daughter in foster care

11:33.214 --> 11:34.180
and she's trying to get her back,

11:34.215 --> 11:36.082
but the judge won't give her custody

11:36.117 --> 11:38.117
unless she gets a good-paying job.

11:39.954 --> 11:42.088
So, I... I was wondering maybe...

11:42.123 --> 11:45.892
is there anything for
her at your office?

11:45.910 --> 11:47.827
Oh, I wish I could help, Callie,

11:47.829 --> 11:49.896
but we're... I mean, we're
a really small operation

11:49.931 --> 11:51.848
and there are just... there's
nothing available right now.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.866
But, um...

11:53.902 --> 11:55.835
I mean, I'll keep that in mind.

11:55.870 --> 11:57.870
Yeah, thanks. I just thought I'd ask.

11:59.274 --> 12:00.840
Hey!

12:00.892 --> 12:02.809
Thought I'd surprise you and come
check out the sets before work.

12:02.844 --> 12:05.711
Oh. Well, the sets aren't
much to check out right now.

12:05.747 --> 12:07.079
- I can hear you.
- Oh, I'm aware.

12:07.115 --> 12:08.681
Stef: Hey, guys! How's it goin'?

12:08.733 --> 12:11.083
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:11.119 --> 12:12.118
What are... what are you doing here?

12:12.170 --> 12:15.087
Uh, your mom said that
you might need some help.

12:15.123 --> 12:16.189
Yeah, we do actually.

12:16.191 --> 12:17.957
Stef: Brandon, this is Gabe.

12:17.992 --> 12:20.092
This is Jesus and
Mariana's birth father.

12:20.128 --> 12:22.028
Nice to meet you.

12:23.081 --> 12:24.914
Uh, you work in construction, right?

12:24.966 --> 12:26.999
Uh, yeah. Yeah, happy to help...

12:27.035 --> 12:29.886
if that's cool with you?

12:29.938 --> 12:32.805
Uh, yeah. Yeah, totally.

12:32.841 --> 12:34.824
Yeah. Show me what needs to be done.

12:37.846 --> 12:39.879
- Is it okay for him to be here?
- Yeah.

12:39.914 --> 12:40.897
Absolutely. As long as...

12:40.949 --> 12:43.182
as long as I'm here to supervise.

12:43.218 --> 12:44.834
Hi, I'm...

12:44.886 --> 12:47.737
- I'm Stef. Brandon's mom.
- Hi.

12:47.772 --> 12:50.122
Sorry, this is Cort... ney.

12:50.158 --> 12:53.142
Cortney. Um, we work
together at The Smokehouse.

12:53.194 --> 12:55.077
Oh, that's right. You're
one of the bartenders.

12:55.129 --> 12:57.013
- I thought I recognized you.
- Yeah.

12:57.048 --> 12:59.932
I'm just stopping in on my way to work

12:59.968 --> 13:00.950
to check out the space.

13:01.002 --> 13:03.002
So, I'm thinking

13:03.004 --> 13:04.103
depending on how many people are coming,

13:04.138 --> 13:06.873
we could have two bar areas?

13:06.908 --> 13:08.808
I... I think that'd be... good.

13:08.843 --> 13:11.777
Okay. I'll see if I can work out
a deal with one of our vendors.

13:11.813 --> 13:12.845
Well, thank you so much for helping out.

13:12.881 --> 13:14.931
- Yeah. Um, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you!

13:14.983 --> 13:17.750
Uh... okay.

13:17.819 --> 13:19.819
Well, thank you for coming by, and...

13:19.854 --> 13:21.854
you know, I'll... I'll walk you out.

13:21.890 --> 13:23.689
(sighs)

13:29.847 --> 13:32.782
- So thanks for...
- Oh, it's fine.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.051
I have a kid.

13:35.086 --> 13:38.054
I'm not exactly San Diego's
most eligible bachelorette.

13:38.106 --> 13:41.073
That's not gonna be an issue.

13:41.075 --> 13:43.142
Seriously, my moms are cool.

13:43.177 --> 13:47.079
I just haven't told them that
I'm seeing, like, anyone, so...

13:47.115 --> 13:48.114
But... but I want them to meet you,

13:48.166 --> 13:50.049
like, really meet you.

13:50.084 --> 13:51.217
Okay. Slow your roll.

13:51.269 --> 13:55.888
I'm not exactly ready to really
meet the parents yet either.

13:55.924 --> 13:58.858
Why are you so perfect?

14:01.930 --> 14:03.796
(sighs)

14:18.693 --> 14:20.677
You can say it. I suck.

14:20.712 --> 14:22.295
(chuckles) No, you don't.

14:22.297 --> 14:23.763
And it's not so bad.

14:23.782 --> 14:25.665
I'm gonna need a...

14:25.700 --> 14:28.601
a few cross pieces every 16 inches

14:28.637 --> 14:29.736
unless you want your
sister to fall through

14:29.771 --> 14:31.538
in the middle of the play.

14:31.590 --> 14:32.539
Hey, don't tempt me.

14:32.591 --> 14:34.507
You guys don't get along?

14:35.527 --> 14:39.462
We get along... ish. You know how it is.

14:39.514 --> 14:41.481
I mean, you said you
had a sister, right?

14:42.534 --> 14:44.500
Yeah.

14:44.553 --> 14:47.303
Yeah, we... we fought I guess.

14:49.324 --> 14:50.490
Do you guys get along now?

14:52.427 --> 14:54.360
No, we don't talk.

14:55.664 --> 14:59.315
After I went to prison, the
family pretty much wrote me off.

14:59.351 --> 15:01.734
And she's got kids, so...

15:01.770 --> 15:04.621
It's not like I can exactly go
to birthday parties and stuff.

15:06.691 --> 15:07.740
Oh...

15:07.776 --> 15:10.677
Is... is that...

15:10.712 --> 15:13.596
is that why you... you
never tried to see us?

15:13.648 --> 15:15.665
I mean, 'cause you couldn't?

15:15.700 --> 15:17.667
No.

15:17.702 --> 15:21.588
Look, I was 18 when Ana
told me she was pregnant.

15:21.623 --> 15:23.456
Wait, you knew?

15:23.458 --> 15:25.425
Yeah.

15:25.460 --> 15:28.595
Yeah, but I was in prison
and, you know, she was 15

15:28.630 --> 15:32.398
and I told her to...

15:32.434 --> 15:34.484
you know, not to do it.

15:34.519 --> 15:37.420
She was too young to have a kid,

15:37.472 --> 15:39.472
and I wasn't in any
position to take care of one,

15:39.474 --> 15:42.342
and I didn't think that
she could do it on her own.

15:43.428 --> 15:44.377
And I was right.

15:47.415 --> 15:48.748
Being with her,

15:48.783 --> 15:50.717
choices I made to be with her...

15:52.354 --> 15:54.671
ruined my life.

15:54.706 --> 15:56.756
Nothing good came out of
anything I did back then.

Wait, no, I still got a
ton of stuff I gotta do.

16:04.566 --> 16:05.615
Well, I... I can stay.

16:12.175 --> 16:14.424
Well, thank you, Gabe. That's very nice.

16:14.459 --> 16:16.309
Appreciate it.

16:16.361 --> 16:17.477
Yeah, thanks.

16:19.381 --> 16:22.348
Oh. Uh, the alarm
arms itself on at 6:00.

16:22.384 --> 16:24.484
Code's seven, eight, seven, nine.

16:24.519 --> 16:26.369
Okay. Got it.

16:32.661 --> 16:35.261
Stef: Hey, babe? Can we have a word?

16:36.348 --> 16:37.764
Uh, yeah.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.282
What's up?

16:39.334 --> 16:41.668
We, uh, we wanted to talk
to you about Cortney, is it?

16:41.703 --> 16:43.703
Uh, yeah. What...
what... what about her?

16:43.738 --> 16:45.672
Uh, well, I saw you guys
kissing in the parking lot.

16:45.707 --> 16:48.441
What, were you spying on us?

16:48.493 --> 16:49.609
- No.
- Are you guys dating?

16:51.513 --> 16:52.545
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

16:52.597 --> 16:54.447
I mean, I guess. You know, it's new.

16:54.482 --> 16:57.483
Okay. And she's a bartender,
so she's at least 21, yeah?

16:57.519 --> 17:00.453
- So?
- So you're 17.

17:00.488 --> 17:02.305
Well, yeah, I'm almost 18, though,

17:02.340 --> 17:03.423
and she's just 21.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.425
Okay, but that's still
a three-year difference.

17:05.460 --> 17:08.328
Well... well, you're three
years older than Mama.

17:08.363 --> 17:09.679
Mama was 26 when we met.

17:09.731 --> 17:11.364
Okay, well, I'm not... I'm
not gonna stop seeing her.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.299
No one is asking you to do that.

17:13.335 --> 17:15.734
B, are you guys having sex?

17:15.770 --> 17:17.637
- No.
- Okay, good,

17:17.672 --> 17:19.672
and since Cort is older,
we're asking you not to

17:19.708 --> 17:21.607
until you are 18, at least.

17:21.659 --> 17:23.659
- This is ridiculous.
- Stef: Hey, is it?

17:23.712 --> 17:25.645
Gabe and Ana were three years apart.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.530
and he was arrested for statutory rape.

17:27.565 --> 17:29.582
Wait, so you're gonna arrest Cortney

17:29.634 --> 17:30.633
- if we have sex?
- Stef: No...

17:30.685 --> 17:31.952
What about heavy petting?

17:32.004 --> 17:34.087
I mean, how far can we go
before you throw her in a jail?

17:34.222 --> 17:36.256
Okay, calm down. Nobody
is arresting Cortney.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.091
We just want you to be careful, Brandon.

17:38.126 --> 17:40.143
We want you to focus on
school and on Julliard.

17:40.195 --> 17:42.062
I am focused.

17:42.097 --> 17:45.432
I am. I... I've written
music to an entire play

17:45.467 --> 17:47.467
and... and I'm probably
the only senior who's

17:47.502 --> 17:49.052
almost done with his thesis project,

17:49.087 --> 17:52.372
so I've got it handled, okay?

17:54.376 --> 17:55.975
So, are we, like, done here?

17:56.027 --> 17:57.360
For now, yes.

18:01.416 --> 18:04.317
I really don't see
why he's being so mean.

18:04.352 --> 18:07.320
I mean, he moved on
with rockabilly Barbie.

18:09.141 --> 18:11.291
You know, Zoey, Junior...

18:11.326 --> 18:13.293
never met a cherry
print she didn't like.

18:15.197 --> 18:17.197
Are you even listening?

18:17.199 --> 18:19.165
Sorry, um...

18:19.201 --> 18:21.067
I'm trying to track down

18:21.103 --> 18:23.002
this girl Justina was friends with

18:23.038 --> 18:24.053
- when she was little.
- (phone rings)

18:24.089 --> 18:26.139
She got lost in the system and...

18:26.174 --> 18:30.043
I was thinking I could,
like, reunite them.

18:30.078 --> 18:33.980
Well, what else did
Justina tell you about her?

18:36.118 --> 18:39.385
Sometimes a specific detail can help.

18:46.328 --> 18:48.228
"Mrs. Beasley doll"?

18:48.263 --> 18:50.263
Yeah, it's a long story.

18:51.366 --> 18:53.233
Is that her?

19:00.176 --> 19:02.709
<i>My mother was a drug addict.</i>

19:03.111 --> 19:06.112
<i>The first time I was taken from her,</i>

19:06.148 --> 19:08.047
<i>I was two-years-old</i>

19:08.083 --> 19:12.051
<i>and I was placed in several foster homes</i>

19:12.087 --> 19:15.021
<i>until I was around seven
when I was finally placed</i>

19:15.056 --> 19:17.390
<i>with a loving couple</i>

19:17.392 --> 19:19.292
<i>whom weren't able to have
children of their own,</i>

19:19.327 --> 19:22.295
<i>and I made my first best friend there.</i>

19:22.330 --> 19:24.247
<i>She gave me her Mrs. Beasley doll.</i>

19:24.299 --> 19:26.299
<i>But one night,</i>

19:26.334 --> 19:29.269
<i>social workers came
and they took me away.</i>

19:29.304 --> 19:31.204
<i>They didn't even let me take my doll.</i>

19:31.239 --> 19:33.173
Wait, so...

19:33.208 --> 19:35.074
Justina's a foster kid?

19:35.110 --> 19:41.047
Justina is Lizzie. The friend
that she told me about was her.

Then how did she know about Wyatt?

19:53.393 --> 19:54.392
Wyatt?

19:54.427 --> 19:56.294
Well, maybe he's talking, but I'm not.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.328
Well, Zoey told Nick

19:57.363 --> 19:59.330
and now he's probably
gonna break up with me.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.299
So, you can thank your
girlfriend for slut-shaming me.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.400
I swear, I didn't...

20:04.404 --> 20:06.237
I didn't say anything.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.105
Then tell Zoey to keep her mouth shut.

20:10.260 --> 20:13.177
Do you remember Karen, art
teach from Anchor Beach?

20:14.280 --> 20:16.163
Stef: Uh, vaguely.

20:16.199 --> 20:18.182
Yeah, she had breast cancer.

20:18.218 --> 20:21.068
Had a double mastectomy a few years ago.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.086
Oh, yeah?

20:22.121 --> 20:25.122
Yeah, I ran into her
in the hall today...

20:25.158 --> 20:29.010
and it occurred to me that she might
be someone you'd like to talk to,

20:29.062 --> 20:32.096
you know, about reconstruction
and your concerns.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.365
How do you know she'd
like to talk to me?

20:34.400 --> 20:38.286
Well, I also remembered that
she was in a support group

20:38.338 --> 20:40.238
and that she actually
had a friend who...

20:40.273 --> 20:41.339
who opted to go flat.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.242
"Go flat"?

20:44.277 --> 20:46.310
Yeah, that's the expression
they use apparently.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.130
And all this just occurred
to you in the hall?

20:51.267 --> 20:52.250
Okay.

20:53.319 --> 20:57.154
Love, I'm really not into
talking with total strangers

20:57.190 --> 20:59.073
about this, you know?

20:59.108 --> 21:02.126
I know you're a private person

21:02.161 --> 21:05.396
and you don't actually
know these women, but...

21:05.431 --> 21:07.398
they've been through what you have.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.001
I don't...

21:10.036 --> 21:12.453
I don't know what to say
or how to advise you...

21:14.023 --> 21:16.440
and I think you need to
talk to someone who does.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.392
<i>♪ This far north ♪</i>

21:18.428 --> 21:20.344

21:22.248 --> 21:24.382
<i>♪ Without a set of teeth ♪</i>

21:24.417 --> 21:28.119
If you're here to pile on,
I already feel like crap.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.220
No, I'm not.

21:32.091 --> 21:34.041
We all make mistakes.

21:40.199 --> 21:42.500
I lost my virginity...

21:42.535 --> 21:45.102
to some guy I didn't even care about.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.105
That's bigger than a mistake.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.475
<i>♪ Alone ♪</i>

21:53.079 --> 21:55.279
Do you think I'm a horrible person?

21:55.315 --> 21:56.280
No.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.350
And...

21:59.385 --> 22:02.219
I have no right to judge.

22:02.255 --> 22:03.220
Why?

22:03.256 --> 22:04.388
Have you ever cheated on someone?

22:04.424 --> 22:07.191
No, but...

22:07.193 --> 22:10.061
I've done things that...

22:11.197 --> 22:13.197
I had sex with someone...

22:15.134 --> 22:17.001
and it was wrong...

22:18.071 --> 22:19.153
and I regret it.

22:21.257 --> 22:24.975
But you just have to live with it and...

22:25.028 --> 22:26.977
carry on.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.294

22:43.296 --> 22:45.396
I knew right away that
I wanted reconstruction.

22:45.431 --> 22:48.232
I thought my husband would be happier,

22:48.234 --> 22:49.333
though he was totally supportive

22:49.385 --> 22:51.335
of whatever decision I wanted to make.

22:51.337 --> 22:52.303
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.157
I've lived my whole life with breasts,

22:56.209 --> 22:59.276
so without them, I mean,
personally, I just...

22:59.312 --> 23:02.046
I felt like I wouldn't feel whole.

23:02.081 --> 23:05.049
And see, I personally didn't feel
I needed breasts to feel whole.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.183
I just didn't want more surgeries

23:06.219 --> 23:08.953
with more possible complications, and...

23:09.005 --> 23:11.389
I didn't want anything
artificial inside my body.

23:11.441 --> 23:14.058
- And see, I love my new boobs.
- (both laugh)

23:14.093 --> 23:17.061
They are perkier than ever
and I haven't had any issues,

23:17.096 --> 23:18.362
and for the first time in my life,

23:18.398 --> 23:20.464
- I can go bra-less, so...
- So can I.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.300
(both laugh)

23:23.336 --> 23:25.269
Hey, sometimes you just
gotta laugh about it.

23:26.272 --> 23:28.372
Did you, um, I mean, did you...

23:28.374 --> 23:33.277
I mean, were you ever worried
about people staring at you?

23:33.279 --> 23:35.379
Well, I was, but, you know,
people don't really notice.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.248
- Yeah.
- Oh.

23:38.367 --> 23:40.234
What'd you, um, what did you do

23:40.286 --> 23:43.170
about the... about
the... about the nipples?

23:43.222 --> 23:45.072
- I had them tattooed.
- Ah.

23:45.108 --> 23:46.240
I didn't do nipples, but...

23:46.275 --> 23:49.043
Oh, she has the most gorgeous tattoo

23:49.095 --> 23:50.127
- Aww.
- across her chest.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.495
It's... You should show them.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.097
Would you like to see?

23:53.132 --> 23:54.498
And I'm happy to show you my implants.

23:56.502 --> 23:58.436
- Uh...
- I think that would be very helpful.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.425
- Oh.
- (gasps) Oh.

24:04.460 --> 24:07.044
Wow, that is so beautiful.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.413
What made you to decide to do a peacock?

24:09.449 --> 24:11.382
Peacocks symbolize self-expression

24:11.384 --> 24:13.984
and confidence and immortality.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.386
And I guess I like being reminded

24:15.421 --> 24:18.355
that no matter what
happens, life is eternal.

24:21.294 --> 24:22.393
Those look great.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.311
(both laugh)

24:24.347 --> 24:28.132
Yeah, they do. They
look... they look good.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.201
- Nice.
- And the nipples are... are very dimensional.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.218
Yeah, I'll give you my guy's info.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.103
- He is a true artist.
- Mm.

24:33.122 --> 24:35.139
Do you wanna feel them?

24:35.174 --> 24:37.107
- Oh, I...
- Oh, no, go ahead.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.043
You can give them a squeeze.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.078
- Well...
- (laughter)

24:43.082 --> 24:44.431
Yeah, sure.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.483
Let's...

24:47.053 --> 24:48.068
- Wow, those... yeah, those...
- Right?

24:48.120 --> 24:50.004
they... they do feel really natural.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.088
It's pretty amazing.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.473
That's... Yeah.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.024
Lena?

24:54.026 --> 24:55.392
Do you want to feel?

24:55.428 --> 24:57.328
I mean, you'll be touching them too.

24:58.347 --> 24:59.930
Um, sure.

25:02.401 --> 25:03.400
(laughs nervously)

25:05.338 --> 25:06.403
Oh.

25:06.439 --> 25:09.240
- They do feel really, really real.
- (door opens)

25:09.242 --> 25:10.374
Oh!

25:10.409 --> 25:12.226
Uh...

25:12.261 --> 25:13.260
Jesus, it's not... It's because...

25:13.312 --> 25:15.279
- It... It...
- It's a medical thing for Mom.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.248
- I'm so sorry.
- This is Ellen and, uh,

25:17.300 --> 25:20.067
you know Karen from school.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.118
Hi.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.189
- Stef: So sorry.
- It's okay.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.143
So I went online last night.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.045
Um...

25:31.080 --> 25:33.147
I was trying to surprise you.

25:33.182 --> 25:35.065
I was trying to find Lizzie.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.036
I think it's gonna be pretty
hard to track her down.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.071
Because you're Lizzie.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.474
I, um, I founds this video

25:43.509 --> 25:47.411
and in it, you were
telling the same story.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.296
Her story.

25:49.348 --> 25:53.267
Why wouldn't you want me to know
that you were a foster kid too?

25:53.302 --> 25:55.419
Call, I didn't tell you I was
a foster kid because I wasn't.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.356
I don't get it.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.275
I used to go to these
fund-raisers all the time

26:01.327 --> 26:03.193
and I would tell Lizzie's story

26:03.229 --> 26:05.229
and people would listen politely...

26:07.266 --> 26:09.133
but they were never moved by it...

26:11.070 --> 26:14.171
until one day, I told it as my own.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.140
So, you lied.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.058
The story is not a lie.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.176
It happened.

26:19.211 --> 26:23.013
And when I made Lizzie's story my own,

26:23.049 --> 26:27.001
it not only opened people's hearts,

26:27.036 --> 26:28.986
but it opened their wallets.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.355
So, that's why you need me.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.458
You're using me and my story
to get money from people?

26:34.460 --> 26:37.294
Well, Callie, money is
what get things done.

26:37.330 --> 26:40.264
Without money, there'd be no reform.

26:40.299 --> 26:43.267
I mean, you can say
that I'm using you...

26:44.403 --> 26:46.236
but for good.

26:46.255 --> 26:48.172
And you're using me too.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.108
- How am I using you?
- Fost and Found.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.077
You need me to help you expand it,

26:53.079 --> 26:55.045
get it out there, right?

26:56.098 --> 26:58.148
And you need me to get
your friend Daphne a job.

26:59.201 --> 27:02.052
I mean, if it's that important to you...

27:02.088 --> 27:03.988
I can do it.

27:08.427 --> 27:09.426
Nick?

27:13.082 --> 27:15.349
Look...

27:15.384 --> 27:19.286
Cheating on Mat was just about
the worst thing I've ever done.

27:20.373 --> 27:22.306
It was a mistake,

27:22.341 --> 27:24.241
one that I'll never make again.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.211
Uh-huh.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.282
I understand if you don't
want to see me anymore.

27:34.286 --> 27:38.105
Look, I was just really surprised

27:38.157 --> 27:40.290
at what Zoey told me, and I...

27:40.326 --> 27:42.192
I don't like surprises.

27:44.113 --> 27:47.197
Hey, look, if you're ever not feeling...

27:47.199 --> 27:51.101
this anymore, then
just be honest with me.

27:51.137 --> 27:55.422
Okay? 'Cause I'd rather
be hurt than surprised.

27:57.443 --> 27:58.392
Deal.

27:59.962 --> 28:02.012
But I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

28:06.335 --> 28:08.285
Come on.

28:08.337 --> 28:09.353
(shutter clicks)

28:10.389 --> 28:12.356
- (shutter clicks)
- There you go.

28:12.408 --> 28:14.224
(shutter clicks)

28:14.260 --> 28:15.376
Daphne: See? Fill mine up too.

28:15.428 --> 28:17.361
- Do both of them. Ready?
- (Tasha laughs)

28:19.281 --> 28:20.297
What happened?

28:20.332 --> 28:23.133
What happened? What happened?

28:29.175 --> 28:30.224
Can you take one of the two of us?

28:30.259 --> 28:32.142
Yeah.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.144
Okay. Ready, Tasha?

28:34.146 --> 28:36.964
That's it. Big smile.

28:36.999 --> 28:38.048
- All right.
- (shutter clicks)

28:38.100 --> 28:39.083
Got it.

28:41.020 --> 28:44.121
Listen, Tashi-bear, I'll see you soon.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.389
Okay, baby?

28:59.972 --> 29:02.222
Every time feels like
it's gonna be the last.

29:03.359 --> 29:05.943
Thanks for the pictures.
You know, in case...

29:05.945 --> 29:07.411
Hey, no. You can't think like that.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.929
I have to.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.181
If the judge lets Tasha's
foster parents adopt her,

29:11.217 --> 29:12.366
it's not like they're
gonna give me visitation.

29:12.401 --> 29:15.219
Okay, well, that's not gonna happen

29:15.254 --> 29:16.386
'cause I got you a job.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.123
What? Where?

29:19.158 --> 29:20.274
With Justina.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.226
It's full-time, 800 bucks a week

29:22.261 --> 29:23.293
- and, like, health insurance.
- Oh, my God.

29:23.345 --> 29:26.180
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
thank you, thank you.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.015
Thank you.

29:30.547 --> 29:32.298
I'm just gonna take pictures.

29:32.350 --> 29:34.150
- Oh, right.
- He asked.

29:34.202 --> 29:36.119
Cortney: You're really good at that.

29:38.139 --> 29:39.222
- Hey!
- Hey.

29:39.257 --> 29:41.574
We just, um, ran into
each other outside.

29:41.610 --> 29:43.243
Yeah, I can... I can see that.

29:44.296 --> 29:46.129
- Hey.
- Hello.

29:46.181 --> 29:49.115
How's it going? Uh...

29:49.150 --> 29:50.516
So the whole cast isn't here yet, but...

29:50.552 --> 29:51.551
It's no problem.

29:51.586 --> 29:53.086
So you're looking for, like, a...

29:53.138 --> 29:54.520
Yeah, I'm kind of going
for, like, a post...

29:54.556 --> 29:57.490
- modern steam...
- modern steampunk thing. Exactly.

29:59.461 --> 30:01.494
So what can I do?

30:01.529 --> 30:03.413
Uh... Paint. Follow me.

30:27.639 --> 30:32.191
Uh, listen. I wanted to
thank you and your sister

30:32.227 --> 30:34.544
for writing those letters for me.

30:34.596 --> 30:36.229
I was, uh...

30:38.233 --> 30:40.550
It meant a lot.

30:40.585 --> 30:42.552
Don't worry about it.

30:43.605 --> 30:45.455
You okay?

30:45.507 --> 30:46.623
You're usually a lot more chatty.

30:46.675 --> 30:48.641
Yeah, well, you don't like chatty.

30:48.677 --> 30:51.444
In fact, I'm pretty sure
you don't even like me.

30:51.479 --> 30:52.578
So why are you doing this?

30:52.631 --> 30:54.380
(stammering) Why would
you think I don't like you?

30:54.432 --> 30:57.317
Because you don't think anything
good came from you and Ana.

30:57.319 --> 30:59.285
I mean, that's what you
said yesterday, right?

30:59.287 --> 31:01.387
No, that's not... Look, I...

31:02.457 --> 31:05.325
I... I didn't mean it like that.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.211
Look, I'm not good at this.

31:09.481 --> 31:13.199
I'm here... because I can't be your dad,

31:13.201 --> 31:15.234
but I want to get to know you.

31:16.271 --> 31:19.238
And I want to... I want
to give you something.

31:19.274 --> 31:24.143
And I'm probably gonna say
and do the wrong thing a lot.

31:24.195 --> 31:25.545
You just got to tell me.

31:25.580 --> 31:28.514
It can't get all pent up inside.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.583
Okay?

31:34.522 --> 31:37.440
All right, Jesus, it's time to go home.

31:37.492 --> 31:39.492
Uh, yeah. I'll go grab a bite

31:39.494 --> 31:42.395
and come back later when nobody's here.

31:42.430 --> 31:45.365
We'll get it done. Don't worry.

31:45.367 --> 31:46.416
Okay.

31:49.537 --> 31:51.454
Is everything going all right?

31:51.489 --> 31:53.373
Yeah... Yeah.

31:53.425 --> 31:55.341
Okay.

31:55.377 --> 31:57.176
Thank you.

31:57.228 --> 31:59.245
For what?

31:59.280 --> 32:01.214
For doing this.

32:03.385 --> 32:05.301
(softly) Oh, baby.

32:08.156 --> 32:11.224
Hey. Um, so I talked to Zoey,

32:11.259 --> 32:15.094
and, um, I guess Wyatt told Talya

32:15.146 --> 32:17.130
and Talya told her, and, um...

32:17.165 --> 32:20.133
Anyway, I'm sorry.

32:21.603 --> 32:25.471
It's not your fault, but... thanks.

32:25.507 --> 32:28.424
Okay. (Sighs)

32:28.476 --> 32:30.109
You guys ready to do this?

32:30.161 --> 32:32.412
- (chuckles nervously)
- (softly) Yeah.

were desperately in love.

33:22.530 --> 33:24.464
That was...

33:24.499 --> 33:26.466
Let's do it again. Yeah?

33:34.542 --> 33:36.374
- Stef: Hey, Ma!
- Hey!

33:37.523 --> 33:40.357
Anything new and exciting happen today?

33:40.409 --> 33:43.594
Uh... No, not really. How's
the set building going?

33:43.629 --> 33:47.331
Uh, you know, there's still
a lot to do and time is short.

33:47.366 --> 33:48.415
Yeah?

33:53.322 --> 33:54.438
(clears throat)

33:55.741 --> 33:58.225
I, uh...

33:58.260 --> 33:59.393
I decided to get the implants.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.645
(gasps)

34:03.349 --> 34:05.666
- Do you hate it?
- Oh, my God. I love it.

34:05.718 --> 34:08.268
It's so sexy.

34:10.356 --> 34:13.290
Oh! What inspired this change?

34:13.292 --> 34:14.675
Look at you!

34:14.710 --> 34:19.646
I think it's my own version
of... of... of Ellen's tatoo.

34:19.697 --> 34:22.666
The peacock. I think
it's, you know, my...

34:22.668 --> 34:25.534
my symbol of confidence.

34:25.571 --> 34:28.405
I've always wanted to
cut my hair really short.

34:28.456 --> 34:30.540
Well, why haven't you done it until now?

34:30.592 --> 34:33.527
'Cause I was afraid I was
going to look like a dyke.

34:33.562 --> 34:36.413
I hate that I have my own
internalized homophobia.

34:36.415 --> 34:39.349
But, um... just really been
struggling, really been struggling with,

34:39.385 --> 34:42.369
with... the way people are going
to look at me without breasts.

34:42.404 --> 34:46.306
As if I, uh... as if I'm
somehow less of a woman,

34:46.342 --> 34:47.690
less feminine.

34:47.726 --> 34:51.328
But you know what? Breasts and
long hair do not make me a woman.

34:51.330 --> 34:55.299
And what the hell do I care
if people think that I'm butch

34:55.351 --> 34:58.402
because they have an idea of what
a woman is supposed to look like.

34:58.404 --> 35:01.221
I just... I just...

35:01.273 --> 35:03.607
I just want to look
the way I want to look.

35:03.642 --> 35:07.244
And letting go...
letting go of that fear,

35:07.246 --> 35:09.579
I guess, just...

35:12.618 --> 35:14.584
I've never felt more feminine.

35:16.638 --> 35:18.188
So...

35:18.240 --> 35:20.457
And I'm gonna need implants
'cause I like having boobs,

35:20.492 --> 35:22.476
not because I'm not me without them.

35:23.645 --> 35:26.396
I love you so much.

35:26.432 --> 35:28.465
I love you too.

35:30.386 --> 35:35.405
And FYI, um, this hair
is getting me a little...

35:35.441 --> 35:37.474
- Oh really?
- Mm-hmm.

35:37.509 --> 35:40.460
- Hmm?
- We have a little time before dinner, you know.

35:41.530 --> 35:45.365
We could, uh... you
know, we don't have to...

35:45.417 --> 35:48.435
We could just get naked and...

35:48.470 --> 35:50.437
- Mm-mm-mm!
- Mm?

35:50.489 --> 35:52.406
(both laugh)

35:52.458 --> 35:54.324
Come on.

35:55.377 --> 35:57.294
- Come.
- Oh!

35:57.296 --> 35:59.229
Am I gonna be the first woman?

35:59.281 --> 36:00.313
- (giggling)
- Get up there!

36:00.366 --> 36:02.332
(shrieking and laughing)

36:04.303 --> 36:06.553
(door sliding open)

36:06.605 --> 36:08.188
Hello?

36:08.223 --> 36:10.240
Oh, um... I'm sorry if I scared you.

36:10.242 --> 36:12.242
I just forgot my script.

36:12.244 --> 36:13.593
Oh.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.617
Thanks so much for helping us out.

36:20.619 --> 36:23.620
You really saved our
asses, mostly Jesus's.

36:23.655 --> 36:25.622
Oh, be nice to your brother.

36:25.657 --> 36:28.425
Actually, he did a great job.

36:28.460 --> 36:32.362
Well, I... really hope
to see you opening night.

36:33.565 --> 36:34.531
I mean...

36:34.533 --> 36:37.401
I'm sorry. Are you not allowed to?

36:37.436 --> 36:39.403
No. Uh, I could.

36:39.438 --> 36:41.488
There'd be enough adults there, but...

36:41.540 --> 36:44.374
Yeah, I don't want to
make anyone uncomfortable.

36:44.410 --> 36:46.476
Like who?

36:46.512 --> 36:49.312
Ana and... her parents.

36:49.364 --> 36:52.349
Well, they did write letters for you.

36:52.384 --> 36:54.434
And so did you.

36:54.470 --> 36:56.319
Thank you for that.

36:59.291 --> 37:01.291
I'd really like you to come.

37:01.293 --> 37:03.260
I mean, if you want to.

37:03.262 --> 37:05.262
Yeah, okay.

37:05.297 --> 37:06.596
Yeah, I'll be there.

37:08.667 --> 37:11.268
Uh, by the way, um,

37:11.303 --> 37:14.538
heard your singing over
the past couple days.

37:14.573 --> 37:16.490
Got a great voice.

37:17.576 --> 37:18.608
Thanks.

37:18.644 --> 37:23.480
My mom, your grandmother,
biological grandmother,

37:23.515 --> 37:25.582
she had a beautiful voice too.

37:25.617 --> 37:27.534
Really?

37:27.586 --> 37:28.618
- Yeah.
- (siren blares)

37:28.620 --> 37:30.554
What's going on?

37:30.556 --> 37:32.556
Police! Hands where I can see 'em!

37:32.558 --> 37:34.491
We got a silent alarm tripped.

37:34.526 --> 37:37.394
Oh God. I forgot. Uh, I
actually have the code.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.429
It's seven, eight, seven, nine.

37:39.498 --> 37:41.431
It's okay. My boyfriend's
dad owns this place.

37:41.483 --> 37:42.566
We're rehearsing for a play.

37:42.568 --> 37:45.469
Still gonna need to see some IDs.

37:45.504 --> 37:47.354
Is that really necessary?

37:47.389 --> 37:48.388
I mean, I can give you his number.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.473
You can call him right now.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.374
Still need those IDs.

37:59.384 --> 38:02.185
These are fantastic.

38:02.221 --> 38:06.339
Mariana going full diva here,
but not exactly your fault.

38:06.391 --> 38:09.192
Yeah, as though I could've stopped her.

38:11.296 --> 38:13.697
Hey, can I, um... ask you a question?

38:13.732 --> 38:15.565
Yeah.

38:15.601 --> 38:17.267
Does Cort have a baby?

38:18.637 --> 38:19.669
What makes you say that?

38:19.705 --> 38:21.171
Her key chain.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.507
It had one of those card things

38:23.559 --> 38:25.575
for a... for a baby store.

38:27.579 --> 38:29.513
Yes, she has a two-year-old.

38:30.682 --> 38:32.432
Do Moms know?

38:32.484 --> 38:34.451
No, and I'd like to keep it that way.

38:34.486 --> 38:36.853
So, what, are you going to be
like the step-dad or something?

38:36.888 --> 38:39.623
No. But you know what? This
isn't any of your business.

38:41.627 --> 38:44.444
Okay. Sorry. Just, um...

38:44.479 --> 38:46.563
didn't want you to do something else

38:46.565 --> 38:48.582
you were going to regret, so...

38:48.617 --> 38:51.334
Whoa. What does that mean?

38:51.386 --> 38:52.402
I, um...

38:54.506 --> 38:58.408
I heard what you told
Mariana last night,

38:58.443 --> 39:01.428
about how you wish
you could take it back.

39:01.463 --> 39:04.347
I wasn't talking about you.

39:04.383 --> 39:06.216
Yeah, right.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.419
I was talking about Dani.

39:09.454 --> 39:11.421
Dani?

39:11.456 --> 39:14.324
Yeah, my dad's girlfriend.

39:14.359 --> 39:16.309
My dad had already broken up with her,

39:16.361 --> 39:19.412
but she came by the apartment and...

39:19.448 --> 39:22.399
I was there, um...

39:22.434 --> 39:25.185
I'd had a few beers...

39:28.707 --> 39:31.308
and I had sex with her.

39:33.245 --> 39:34.678
Brandon, that wasn't sex.

39:34.713 --> 39:37.314
She took advantage of you.
It's like Liam, it's rape.

39:37.349 --> 39:40.200
Statutory rape, it's not the
same, okay? I never said no.

39:40.252 --> 39:41.534
It was still wrong.

39:42.654 --> 39:46.256
She was older and you had been drinking.

39:46.291 --> 39:47.591
Does anyone know?

39:47.609 --> 39:50.226
Moms and... and my dad.

39:52.664 --> 39:54.631
Dani was arrested.

39:58.253 --> 39:59.669
Um...

39:59.671 --> 40:02.672
For a really long time, I...

40:02.708 --> 40:05.609
I thought what happened
with Liam was my fault too.

40:05.644 --> 40:06.693
I felt...

40:09.648 --> 40:13.383
like ashamed and ugly.

40:15.721 --> 40:19.556
It's not how we should
feel. It's how they should.

<i>♪ Morning breaks ♪</i>

40:23.462 --> 40:24.527
You okay?

40:25.580 --> 40:28.465
It wasn't until you...

40:30.519 --> 40:34.471
that I could be with someone...

40:34.473 --> 40:37.524
the way you're supposed to,
without the shame and the guilt,

40:37.576 --> 40:40.510
at least in the moment.

40:42.531 --> 40:44.514
I don't want to regret that.

40:47.502 --> 40:49.452
I don't.

40:50.522 --> 40:52.522
I don't regret it.

40:53.592 --> 40:55.458
At all.

41:02.467 --> 41:04.434
Mr. Duncroft, you're under arrest

41:04.469 --> 41:06.469
for being in proximity
to an unaccompanied minor.

41:06.521 --> 41:08.438
Uh, no, no, no. You can't.

41:08.473 --> 41:09.522
He didn't do anything. I'm his daughter.

41:09.558 --> 41:11.441
- Take a step back, Miss.
- Mariana, it's okay.

41:11.476 --> 41:12.475
No, it's not okay. My mom's a cop.

41:12.477 --> 41:14.394
Stef Adams Foster. You can call her.

41:14.446 --> 41:16.529
- You can't arrest him...
- Mariana, calm down.

41:16.565 --> 41:19.366
I'll be okay. Just call your mom.
