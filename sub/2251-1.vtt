01:04.833 --> 01:12.917
The following is based
on actual events.

01:13.250 --> 01:21.250
30,000 people are reported missing
in Australia every year.

01:21.583 --> 01:27.500
90% are found within a month.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.083
Some are never seen again.

01:57.625 --> 02:00.125
You traveling with two sheilas,
are you, mate?

02:00.667 --> 02:01.625
Uh, yep.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.292
- Two, eh?
- Yep.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.875
That'll be a bit of fun, eh?

02:05.333 --> 02:07.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:07.167 --> 02:08.500
Just sign there.

02:11.875 --> 02:15.250
They get, uh,
real easy when they travel.

02:15.333 --> 02:16.958
Loosen up a bit, hey?

02:18.083 --> 02:20.958
Mate of mine reckons.
He picks 'em up all the time.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.333
Uh-huh.

02:24.917 --> 02:26.917
- That's it?
- Yep, yep.

02:27.083 --> 02:28.083
Good on ya, champ.

02:28.458 --> 02:30.292
Don't do anything I wouldn't do, eh?

02:32.083 --> 02:33.083
Nah. I won't.

02:33.625 --> 02:34.625
Send us a card.

02:35.333 --> 02:36.333
All right.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.833
Fat fuck. What a tool.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.708
How funny's that?

02:58.792 --> 03:01.000
I like that.
I think we should send that one.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.708
Do ya reckon?

03:14.167 --> 03:15.167
Yep.

03:21.667 --> 03:22.958
Yep.

03:30.375 --> 03:31.375
Yep.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.500
How long is this gonna take, mate?

03:40.583 --> 03:42.000
Not long.

03:42.042 --> 03:43.292
How long's not long?

03:43.375 --> 03:45.500
Well, I've almost got it.

03:46.625 --> 03:47.792
Yep.

03:49.792 --> 03:51.167
- Yep.
- Yep!

03:51.250 --> 03:52.292
OK.

03:53.292 --> 03:54.375
Yep.

03:54.458 --> 03:55.833
Yep!

03:55.917 --> 03:57.250
Yep.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.625
- Yep.
- Yep.

04:03.333 --> 04:04.792
He fancies you.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.792
He doesn't.

04:06.833 --> 04:09.333
- Does.
- You fancy him.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.000
I don't think so.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.708
The three of us are going to be
stuck in a car together for three weeks,

04:17.791 --> 04:21.625
and it'll be trying enough without
"is it me, or is he being weird today?"

04:21.666 --> 04:23.042
lt'd drive me barmy.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.625
Yeah. You're right.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.167
He is cute, though.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.000
Do you think he's really got
a girlfriend in Sydney?

04:32.083 --> 04:33.458
Why would he lie?

04:33.500 --> 04:34.750
He's a bloke.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.750
I can't believe we're leaving.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.292
I know.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.833
It feels like two years,
not two weeks.

04:54.833 --> 04:55.833
Whoo!

04:58.167 --> 04:59.125
Wow!

05:00.958 --> 05:02.667
- Want a lift?
- I'd love it.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.333
I thought I requested purple.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.000
Eh. For 1,500 bucks
we're lucky it's got doors.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.083
I love it.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.292
Hey, where's my stuff?

05:09.375 --> 05:11.292
We forgot about food for you. Sorry.

05:11.333 --> 05:14.458
Yeah, we thought you'd get by
on our gratitude and appreciation.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.458
Where's the booze?

05:23.500 --> 05:25.167
Oh, we've made a decision.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.208
After last night,
never drinking again.

05:27.292 --> 05:28.917
We've got to get an early start

05:29.000 --> 05:31.458
if we want to get to Wolf Creek
by tomorrow night.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.667
Mm-hmm.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.792
Piss off. Of course I checked.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.500
How much of an organization Nazi is she?

05:38.583 --> 05:40.875
No, she's right. In bed by 9:30.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.625
This is bad, actually.

05:58.708 --> 05:59.708
Oh!

06:00.333 --> 06:03.083
You weren't gonna drink that.
Is that your beer?

06:03.167 --> 06:05.500
- Patrick. Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:05.583 --> 06:08.458
That's a pretty nice handshake there.
Let's give it a kiss.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.500
Lovely, lovely.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.583
- I can pack a punch.
- You can pack a punch?

06:11.667 --> 06:12.792
Why would you want that?

06:12.875 --> 06:15.958
- I would if I had to.
- If you had to?

06:16.083 --> 06:18.000
You gotta hear this bullshit story.

06:18.250 --> 06:21.167
Bullshit! It wasn't bullshit!

06:25.417 --> 06:27.833
Ten foot wave sprayin'.

06:27.917 --> 06:29.583
Shh! Shh!

07:01.583 --> 07:03.125
Go on!

07:16.292 --> 07:17.917
I think it's past 9:30.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.292
I got the worst taste in my mouth.

10:57.292 --> 11:02.083
"Wolf Creek"
thriller, Australia, 2005

11:02.292 --> 11:05.208
# Daddy Cool: Eagle Rock

13:51.667 --> 13:54.167
# I'd like to sing a song for you

13:55.333 --> 13:57.208
OK, let me start again.

13:57.917 --> 13:58.917
Here we go.

14:04.042 --> 14:06.292
- # I love her
- Oh, God.

14:06.375 --> 14:07.833
# I really, really love her

14:10.000 --> 14:13.083
# Make me smile all the time

14:14.458 --> 14:17.167
# When you cook my food
and you clean my room

14:17.250 --> 14:19.667
# I love you, Mum
I love you, Mum

14:20.833 --> 14:23.125
# He's been playing guitar

14:23.167 --> 14:24.792
# For a few weeks now

14:24.833 --> 14:27.125
# And he's really,
really, really crap

14:27.208 --> 14:29.875
# And he's crap

14:29.958 --> 14:32.000
# Really shit

14:32.083 --> 14:34.500
# I'm not that bad

14:39.667 --> 14:41.792
Oh, my God!

14:41.833 --> 14:43.292
Yeah, that's cool.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.208
That's amazing.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.708
You're near the world's
fifth biggest UFO sighting area.

14:49.750 --> 14:52.250
- Kristy, I'm serious.
- I know!

14:52.417 --> 14:55.125
- I can hear you laughing.
- What? I'm listening.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.167
Fine.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.458
- I'm listening.
- Tell us.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.833
Don't listen to her.
Tell me. I'm listening.

15:00.917 --> 15:02.417
All right. I read about this guy

15:02.500 --> 15:04.708
who was driving out
on the highway out there.

15:04.750 --> 15:08.750
And he sees this light ahead of him,
around 500 meters,

15:08.833 --> 15:12.375
and at first he thinks it's a truck
or a semi-trailer or something,

15:12.417 --> 15:15.708
'cause the light's really bright,
like glowing orange and shit.

15:15.792 --> 15:17.708
- Yeah.
- But as he gets closer,

15:17.750 --> 15:22.375
he realizes that the light's
about 10 meters off the ground,

15:22.417 --> 15:24.042
just hanging in mid-air.

15:24.083 --> 15:27.292
So he's scared, freaking out.

15:27.375 --> 15:30.042
And then he hears this... crack!

15:31.250 --> 15:32.375
Like an explosion.

15:32.417 --> 15:35.208
- That was supposed to scare us.
- I know, it's scary.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.417
But he did. He heard this crack.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.917
Like an explosion of a jet.

15:39.958 --> 15:44.375
And itjust took off into the sky,
straight up like a rocket.

15:44.417 --> 15:47.042
And then as soon as it was gone,

15:47.083 --> 15:50.208
his carjust stopped
in the middle of the road,

15:50.292 --> 15:52.750
and it was totally silent.

15:52.833 --> 15:57.208
He was just sitting there,
staring up at the stars.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.125
In the middle of nowhere.

16:02.750 --> 16:05.333
- Hey...
- No reason. Just stopped.

16:05.417 --> 16:07.417
- Is that a true story?
- I read it.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.042
You've got something
dripping off your lip there.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.083
What?

16:11.167 --> 16:13.167
Oh, it's all right.
It's just bullshit.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.792
No, bullshit you, mate!

16:28.750 --> 16:30.208
What's all this shit?

16:30.292 --> 16:31.875
- Oh, for the tent.
- For the tent.

16:31.917 --> 16:34.792
- Here, I'll do that. Start on the tent.
- No, you do the tent.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.542
I don't know what you two
would do without me.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.875
- I didn't finish that.
- Oh, sorry.

16:46.917 --> 16:49.708
- This is it.
- I finished it for you.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.583
- What?
- I didn't know what to do!

16:52.917 --> 16:54.167
- All right?
- Yep.

16:55.333 --> 16:58.542
Now we just got a six-hour drive.
Who's driving first?

16:58.583 --> 17:00.292
- Oh!
- Who's driving first?

17:00.375 --> 17:01.917
I don't know.
I'll go in the back.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.708
- Is that all right with you?
- Yeah.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.250
- I'll go in the back.
- Do you want to drive?

18:27.833 --> 18:29.875
We're here, guys.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.583
Well, well, well.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.833
Hey, um, can I have the keys?

19:19.958 --> 19:21.958
Oh, it's OK, you two. I've got it.

19:22.042 --> 19:24.417
Thanks. No problems, guys.

19:57.625 --> 19:59.333
<i>How's the hair?</i>

19:59.417 --> 20:01.833
<i>Day one. Captain's log.</i>

20:01.917 --> 20:05.750
<i>So far, no sign
of intelligent life forms.</i>

20:05.833 --> 20:09.625
<i>Starting to doubt... Hey.</i>

20:09.708 --> 20:11.417
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
<i>Um, do you wanna say hello?</i>

20:14.708 --> 20:16.000
<i>- Hello.</i>

20:16.083 --> 20:17.542
<i>Righto. What's your name?</i>

20:17.625 --> 20:18.750
<i>- Graham.
- Graham.</i>

20:18.833 --> 20:20.125
<i>Nice to meet you, Graham.</i>

20:20.208 --> 20:21.917
<i>I'm Ben.</i>

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
<i>- This one too?
- Yeah, man.</i>

20:44.500 --> 20:47.042
I think someone's got a crush on you.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.500
Yeah, the attendant. I thought so.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.000
- No.
- Graham.

20:52.083 --> 20:55.792
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-uh.

20:55.875 --> 20:59.083
I'm getting the feeling it's mutual.
Am I wrong?

21:02.083 --> 21:03.667
You know it's true!

21:03.750 --> 21:06.333
- Do you mind?
- You do!

21:06.417 --> 21:08.875
I think it's absolutely fabulous.

21:10.083 --> 21:13.292
But don't go dicking her around,
because she's totally brilliant.

21:13.375 --> 21:15.917
If you hurt her,
I'm going to have to kill you.

21:16.917 --> 21:19.500
So my advice is that we have
an awesome time together.

21:19.583 --> 21:22.125
You sort out whatever it is
going on between you and this

21:22.208 --> 21:24.875
so-called girlfriend
you've allegedly got.

21:24.917 --> 21:30.583
By the time we get to Oairns, we'll
find some freakishly hot man for me,

21:30.667 --> 21:33.250
and we'll all, you know,
go crazy together, all right?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.667
All right.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.458
She's only a little one, isn't she?

21:38.542 --> 21:41.375
I reckon I could break that
in half real quickly, eh?

21:42.083 --> 21:43.500
Youse two'd be watching me.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.542
Here comes yours now, mate.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.417
What a place, huh?

21:57.500 --> 22:00.167
Hey, uh... Hey, mate. Oi.

22:00.250 --> 22:04.417
Oi. Hey, come here.
I got a question for ya.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.833
All right. You keep that.

22:07.917 --> 22:09.375
How're you going?

22:09.417 --> 22:11.042
Hey, uh...

22:11.083 --> 22:12.417
Me and me mates are gonna see

22:12.500 --> 22:15.875
if your girlfriends would be interested
in a little bit of a gang bang.

22:23.583 --> 22:27.417
We just want to make sure
it's all right with you first.

22:33.167 --> 22:35.208
Good on ya. Fuckhead.

22:36.250 --> 22:38.375
Hey, what'd you say?

22:41.500 --> 22:42.542
I said...

22:45.375 --> 22:46.417
I said that's, um...

22:47.250 --> 22:51.500
...a nice smile you got.

22:53.417 --> 22:57.208
Bazza, don't be a dickhead.

22:58.875 --> 23:01.833
See you later, sweetheart.

23:06.583 --> 23:07.542
Bye.

23:11.917 --> 23:13.958
Fucking assholes.

23:22.458 --> 23:24.458
Bunch of morons. Honestly.

23:24.542 --> 23:27.500
- Yeah. Forget about it, Ben.
- No, I should've smashed him.

23:31.250 --> 23:34.375
I should've T'ai Ohi'd his ass.

23:34.417 --> 23:36.000
I'm serious.

23:58.125 --> 24:00.667
The weather's shit.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.250
Yeah. All of a sudden.

24:03.792 --> 24:06.042
I think it's the start
of the wet season, so...

24:07.167 --> 24:09.625
That's beautiful
over there, isn't it?

24:09.708 --> 24:13.167
That light coming up through
the mountains. It's gorgeous.

24:13.917 --> 24:16.500
I hope it doesn't rain.

24:16.917 --> 24:18.583
what?

24:18.667 --> 24:21.875
- I said I hope it doesn't rain.
- Man, it's gonna be cold tonight.

24:21.958 --> 24:24.500
I mean cold.

24:25.083 --> 24:26.875
Great.

24:36.583 --> 24:38.375
Hey, I think that's the start of it.

24:38.417 --> 24:41.292
So it's in there?
You've got to climb over the top?

24:41.375 --> 24:42.833
Um, yeah.

24:42.958 --> 24:44.667
Aw!

24:44.750 --> 24:46.708
- What was that?
- Rock.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
There's just nothing out here.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.000
I know. It's great.

24:57.250 --> 25:00.375
Here we go.
Wolf Creek Crater!

25:00.458 --> 25:02.792
- Crater! We're here!
- Whoo!

25:02.875 --> 25:04.042
"Walking trail."

25:04.125 --> 25:07.250
- "Allow, three... Three hours."
- Three hours?

25:07.333 --> 25:10.875
Is that three hours to get all the way
to the middle or to get up to the top?

25:10.917 --> 25:13.708
- I imagine it's to the top.
- It's to the top.

25:13.792 --> 25:16.042
No camping. Hiking's allowed.

25:16.083 --> 25:19.083
Put rubbish in your bin
and no fires. OK.

25:19.125 --> 25:21.333
Right. Great. Let's go.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.875
- Wow. Madame.
- Thank you.

25:23.958 --> 25:27.667
- Wolf Creek awaits you.
- Oh, wow!

25:27.750 --> 25:29.708
Wolf Creek!

25:31.083 --> 25:32.833
Wow.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.417
It's a souvenir...

25:47.417 --> 25:49.375
What is with this weather?

25:51.708 --> 25:54.167
- Maybe we should take an umbrella.
- Yeah.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.208
Yeah, definitely.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.833
What do you want to take?

25:57.917 --> 26:00.875
- All of it.
- All what's in the Esky.

26:00.958 --> 26:04.167
- And who's carrying all of this?
- You are.

26:04.250 --> 26:07.333
- Just all of it.
- All right, three hours.

26:07.875 --> 26:10.167
- Let's do it!
- Let's go.

26:10.750 --> 26:11.833
Oh, wait.

26:15.083 --> 26:16.958
Oh, there's poo everywhere!

26:17.042 --> 26:20.000
Yay! We're on the poo planet.

26:27.542 --> 26:30.000
There's another skull. Look.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.250
They're bones!

26:32.333 --> 26:35.333
Oh, my God, there's bones everywhere!

26:44.167 --> 26:46.667
What are you doing?
It's not raining that bad.

26:46.750 --> 26:49.750
Yeah, it is.
It's freezing. I've got no jumper.

26:49.833 --> 26:52.958
- Where did the meteorite go?
- It's in the middle.

26:53.208 --> 26:55.833
- Just went into the ground?
- Yeah.

26:57.375 --> 27:00.750
Look how good it looks. Ooo-ooh!

27:05.750 --> 27:06.708
Come on!

27:08.083 --> 27:09.667
Whoo!

27:10.792 --> 27:11.792
Here.

27:12.375 --> 27:13.375
You all right?

27:24.250 --> 27:27.500
Wow. That's impressive.

27:28.583 --> 27:32.333
You're looking at one of the
biggest meteorite craters on the planet.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.542
They reckon the explosion
from the impact

27:34.583 --> 27:38.875
would've been like 200 nuclear bombs
going off at the same time.

27:39.083 --> 27:43.750
Some guys discovered it
scouting for an oil company in 1947.

27:46.417 --> 27:49.208
Imagine being
the first person to see it.

27:58.583 --> 28:00.292
Hey. Let's go.

28:14.125 --> 28:15.792
You all right?

28:21.917 --> 28:23.792
- This is great, Ben.
- Yeah. Thank you.

28:23.875 --> 28:25.208
It's fantastic. Thank you.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.250
Such a sweetheart, aren't you?

28:28.292 --> 28:30.000
Loving it.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.083
Yeah. It's great.

28:33.167 --> 28:34.875
Sorry. I didn't know.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.542
It'll clear.
Give it a couple of hours.

28:43.167 --> 28:44.625
Thank you.

28:51.792 --> 28:53.250
Back soon.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.333
Where are you going?

29:15.250 --> 29:18.292
I wonder why the meteor hit here.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.583
In this place. Nowhere else.

29:30.417 --> 29:34.333
Maybe it was drawn
to something in the Earth.

29:36.250 --> 29:39.375
- Like when lightning strikes.
- Hmm.

29:40.292 --> 29:43.167
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

29:57.458 --> 30:00.417
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:03.417 --> 30:05.417
That's awesome.

31:02.875 --> 31:05.083
I was wondering what
that would be like.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.333
Kris, what's the time?

31:19.417 --> 31:22.375
Uh, don't know.
Watch has stopped.

31:23.375 --> 31:25.292
It's like Niagara Falls!

31:25.375 --> 31:26.583
Whoo!

31:29.083 --> 31:32.708
- Hey, have you got the time?
- Nah. It's busted.

31:33.833 --> 31:37.500
I'd say it's about 7:00.
So about an hour till dark.

31:37.583 --> 31:39.542
We'll make it back to Halls Creek, easy.

31:39.625 --> 31:41.875
Kristy's watch stopped too.

31:43.542 --> 31:46.875
- Bullshit. Did it really?
- Yeah.

31:46.958 --> 31:50.125
6:30. Mine too.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.167
What, batteries or something?

31:53.250 --> 31:55.375
You got the keys?

31:59.417 --> 32:02.000
Make sure you warm her up first.

32:05.917 --> 32:09.500
- It's weird weather, eh?
- Yeah, I reckon. God.

32:09.667 --> 32:13.667
See you later, Wolf Creek.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.458
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

32:29.708 --> 32:31.125
Did we leave the lights on?

32:31.208 --> 32:33.833
No.

32:33.917 --> 32:36.167
Is it... Is it in gear?

32:36.250 --> 32:40.250
No. Try... Try again.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.458
Fuck.

32:44.625 --> 32:46.583
OK.

32:46.625 --> 32:49.792
Shit.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Uh, pop... Pop the hood.

32:52.083 --> 32:54.333
It's probably just
the battery terminals.

33:06.583 --> 33:08.000
This one...

33:12.625 --> 33:14.625
Do you know what you're looking for?

33:23.250 --> 33:25.042
Oh...

33:26.208 --> 33:27.792
Are you gonna tell Liz?

33:27.875 --> 33:30.583
I've got a feeling
she already knows.

33:30.667 --> 33:33.750
I'll go see what I can do.

33:36.708 --> 33:38.667
Did you hear that?

33:41.708 --> 33:43.833
- You didn't leave the lights on?
- No.

33:43.917 --> 33:45.667
No.

33:53.833 --> 33:55.042
Fucker.

33:56.292 --> 33:58.792
Looks like we might be
spending the night.

34:01.708 --> 34:03.917
This is fucked.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.792
Bitch.

34:35.417 --> 34:37.042
I am your father.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.625
Do you think it means anything?

34:58.250 --> 35:03.583
I mean, the watches
and the car not working.

35:05.542 --> 35:08.375
- What do you mean?
- Well...

35:08.417 --> 35:13.583
You know the stories I was telling you
last night about the UFOs and stuff.

35:13.667 --> 35:17.167
And when they were around,

35:17.958 --> 35:21.000
well, things stopped working.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.917
Oould be the same kind of thing.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.792
Ben, I really don't think we need to be
talking about that right now.

35:30.750 --> 35:32.417
OK.

35:39.917 --> 35:41.667
There's something out there.

35:43.708 --> 35:46.708
- And it ain't no man.
- No, no. I saw some lights.

35:46.833 --> 35:50.542
- Where?
- Right... Right there.

35:50.625 --> 35:53.208
- There.
- What the hell?

35:54.333 --> 35:56.042
No, no, no.
Don't fucking... What?

35:56.083 --> 35:58.750
- It might be a car!
- Well, it might not be a car!

36:00.250 --> 36:03.792
- That don't look like no car.
- Shit. It's coming this way.

36:03.875 --> 36:05.583
Fuck, it is coming this way. Shit.

36:05.667 --> 36:08.250
- Fuck!
- Fuck. It is coming this way.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.167
- Should we run?
- No, no, no!

36:10.250 --> 36:12.458
Just stay in the car! Don't move.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.583
Hold on.
Hang on, it's a car.

36:24.667 --> 36:27.333
How do you know?

36:27.417 --> 36:29.833
It's a bloody car! Shit!

36:29.917 --> 36:32.792
I can hear the engine.

36:50.417 --> 36:52.875
What the bloody hell
are you mob doing out here?

36:52.958 --> 36:55.875
Scared the shit out of me.

36:56.167 --> 36:58.042
We thought it was aliens.

37:00.167 --> 37:03.708
- Well, she did.
- Hi.

37:03.750 --> 37:07.042
It was pissing down with rain earlier.
I was just about to chuck it in.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.958
Lucky for you mob I decided to
hang around a bit longer, eh?

37:10.042 --> 37:12.750
Yeah. We were just getting
ready to spend the night too.

37:12.833 --> 37:16.875
Ah, well. We'll get you
outta here quick smart.

37:16.958 --> 37:19.625
Come on, you bloody sparkplug!

37:19.708 --> 37:22.375
Where ya heading?

37:22.417 --> 37:24.667
- Darwin, sort of.
- Yeah, then on to Oairns.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.083
- That's where we're really headed.
- Long drive.

37:27.167 --> 37:28.875
- Yeah.
- It's too long.

37:28.917 --> 37:30.625
- British, are youse?
- Yeah.

37:30.708 --> 37:33.167
- That's right.
- Ben's an Aussie, though.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.125
- Yeah? Where ya from, mate?
- Sydney.

37:36.208 --> 37:38.875
Poofta capital of Australia.

37:38.917 --> 37:42.250
Just playing with you, tiger.

37:42.333 --> 37:44.333
Never been over there myself.

37:44.417 --> 37:46.792
Lucky you sheilas
are traveling with a bloke.

37:46.875 --> 37:48.292
Oan't be too careful.

37:50.167 --> 37:53.042
- Ooh!
- Nothing wrong with the battery.

37:54.917 --> 37:57.542
- I told you we'd be all right.
- I know. He's hilarious.

37:57.583 --> 38:00.583
He's like one of those guys
from the outback Australia shows.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.458
- Yeah!
- Like Orocodile Dundee.

38:02.542 --> 38:04.250
He's a pisser.

38:04.333 --> 38:06.750
You're an Aussie.
How come you don't talk like him?

38:06.833 --> 38:09.833
You want the bad news?
Or the really bad news?

38:10.667 --> 38:13.917
Well, your coil's rooted.
Oactus. You're not going nowhere.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.667
- What can we do?
- Fuck. I had it totally checked...

38:16.750 --> 38:19.375
- Ben. Fuck.
- Must be something we can do.

38:19.417 --> 38:23.375
You take the old one out,
bung the new one in, Bob's your sister.

38:23.458 --> 38:26.667
The only good news is
I got the gear to do it.

38:26.750 --> 38:29.458
Problem is, it's back at my camp
just down the road a ways.

38:29.542 --> 38:31.208
I'm going back down there anyway,

38:31.250 --> 38:34.042
so I could give you a tow,
fix it tonight.

38:34.125 --> 38:36.125
Probably have you
on the road by morning.

38:36.208 --> 38:38.542
Otherwise, someone'll
be coming through here.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.167
Eventually.

38:41.208 --> 38:43.542
Make up your mind,
'cause I gotta get a rattle on.

38:43.583 --> 38:45.458
- Thank you
- Thank you.

38:46.917 --> 38:50.167
- What do you guys want to do?
- Might as well.

38:50.250 --> 38:52.083
He's not going to fix it
for free, is he?

38:52.167 --> 38:54.750
What if he wants a couple hundred
pounds or something?

38:54.833 --> 38:57.792
- A thousand, what? I don't know.
- OK, OK.

38:57.875 --> 39:01.208
OK, first we gotta find out
if he wants any money or not.

39:01.250 --> 39:03.875
- I don't have a lot of cash on me.
- Me, neither.

39:03.958 --> 39:05.625
Nor do I.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.375
Duh.

39:10.083 --> 39:13.292
Why don't we get him to tow us to town,
and we'll get someone there?

39:13.375 --> 39:14.333
Yeah.

39:17.917 --> 39:19.500
- OK.
- Go on.

39:19.583 --> 39:22.917
- You go on, you ask him.
- I don't want to.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.792
Go on. It's a bloke thing. Go on.

39:24.875 --> 39:26.417
Yeah, you must. Please?

39:26.500 --> 39:27.917
- Yeah.
- It's a bloke thing.

39:29.125 --> 39:30.458
Ask him.

39:36.250 --> 39:39.625
- You didn't need any help?
- Nah, I'm all right. Thanks, though.

39:39.708 --> 39:42.125
Oertain way of putting it in.

39:43.333 --> 39:47.708
Um, I know it's a long way,
but the girls were wondering

39:47.750 --> 39:49.417
if you could tow us back into town.

39:49.500 --> 39:52.500
I mean, we don't wanna put you out
any more than we already have.

39:52.583 --> 39:54.542
Look, I'd really like to help you, mate,

39:54.583 --> 39:56.458
but I'm not heading
that way, you know?

39:56.542 --> 40:00.000
If you don't want the lift,
that's up to you, but I'm heading south.

40:00.083 --> 40:01.958
- South.
- Yeah, south.

40:02.042 --> 40:03.292
South.

40:03.375 --> 40:05.583
- You wanna go north.
- Yeah.

40:05.667 --> 40:07.833
I'm heading south.

40:10.292 --> 40:11.708
Yeah.

40:11.750 --> 40:14.292
- Bit of a bugger.
- Bugger. Yeah.

40:15.667 --> 40:17.958
So, um...

40:22.250 --> 40:24.917
- Well, with that coil...
- Yeah?

40:25.000 --> 40:26.208
...and stuff...

40:27.375 --> 40:31.417
How much would that cost,
say if we just got you to do that?

40:31.500 --> 40:33.333
It's not fuckin' Pitt Street, mate!

40:33.417 --> 40:36.375
Of course I'm not gonna charge you,
you stupid bastard! Hey?

40:36.417 --> 40:40.542
You hear that?
"How much?"

40:45.083 --> 40:46.625
Hey?

40:48.375 --> 40:52.042
- Oh, you sure?
- Oh, Jesus, you make me laugh.

40:53.542 --> 40:55.833
You must keep the little buggers
amused, hey?

40:55.917 --> 40:57.042
Yeah.

40:57.083 --> 41:00.333
You amuse the bloody
bejesus out of me.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.292
All right. I'll get the girls going.

41:02.375 --> 41:04.833
- That'd be a good idea.
- Yeah, good idea.

41:04.917 --> 41:06.542
- Off you go.
- Off I go.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.292
Yay.

41:13.208 --> 41:14.167
All right.

44:02.625 --> 44:04.792
Where did he say his place was again?

44:04.875 --> 44:07.125
South.

44:07.208 --> 44:09.625
It feels like we've been
driving for hours.

44:11.875 --> 44:13.375
We shouldn't be too far.

44:13.458 --> 44:15.833
That's what you said an hour ago.

44:15.917 --> 44:19.250
OK, let's just get him
to drop us off here then, all right?

44:24.500 --> 44:25.833
It's cool.

44:25.917 --> 44:28.417
He said it was gonna be
a bit of a drive, didn't he?

44:28.500 --> 44:29.750
Mm-hmm.

44:32.083 --> 44:33.708
It's cool.

45:34.250 --> 45:36.917
Must be some sort of mining operation.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.833
Hmm. Looks like a ghost town.

46:07.625 --> 46:10.042
- We're here.
- Thank God.

46:10.125 --> 46:11.500
Wherever here is.

46:18.750 --> 46:21.917
- I have plenty of water there.
- Aw, thank you.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.500
It's the one thing
that we don't have plenty of.

46:24.583 --> 46:26.000
Oheers.

46:26.083 --> 46:29.167
Nothing like rainwater
from the top end.

46:29.250 --> 46:31.333
Hey, Mick, this place is amazing.

46:31.417 --> 46:34.542
I can't believe they just walked out
and left all this stuff here.

46:34.583 --> 46:37.208
Plenty of places like this
all over the outback.

46:37.250 --> 46:40.458
Thousands of 'em.
Places people've forgotten about.

46:40.542 --> 46:42.875
Must be a whole town
out there somewhere.

46:42.917 --> 46:45.708
Got lost in a six-month
dust storm back in the '40s.

46:45.792 --> 46:48.208
The people just walked away.

46:48.250 --> 46:51.000
I heard of blokes gettin' lost
on their own farms.

46:51.083 --> 46:52.708
Just never found their way out.

46:52.750 --> 46:54.375
- On their own property?
- Mm-hmm.

46:54.458 --> 46:55.458
That's amazing.

46:55.542 --> 46:58.417
Oh, there's one up here
that crosses three states, right?

46:58.500 --> 47:01.250
- Takes six days to drive across.
- No!

47:01.333 --> 47:03.458
I... I... We used to
work out there once.

47:03.542 --> 47:06.000
- What'd you do there?
- Head shooter.

47:06.083 --> 47:07.833
You know, clearin' vermin.

47:07.917 --> 47:10.958
Roos, horses, pigs, buffalo.
You name it.

47:11.042 --> 47:12.417
Don't work there no more.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.208
Use poisons.
You know, instead of shooters.

47:18.250 --> 47:22.083
Yeah, used to... used to fly in
with the helicopters.

47:22.167 --> 47:25.167
You fly in low
over a herd of water buffalo.

47:25.250 --> 47:28.083
Sometimes take out 50 head
in an afternoon.

47:28.167 --> 47:32.667
I wore out five bolts
on a .303 one year.

47:33.500 --> 47:36.167
Pigs. Pigs were different.
You have to get in close.

47:36.250 --> 47:38.917
Get the dogs onto 'em,
and then you go in with a knife.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
You had to get in under him, you know,
while the pig's fighting off the dogs.

47:43.083 --> 47:44.375
And you had to be quick.

47:44.417 --> 47:46.583
Otherwise, you'd lose
your guts on its tusk.

47:46.667 --> 47:48.875
Sharp!

47:48.917 --> 47:51.167
I seen a big boar pig, right?

47:51.250 --> 47:54.625
Take a pitbull's head
clean off one time.

47:56.083 --> 47:59.583
Little legs still pumpin' away.

47:59.667 --> 48:00.792
Oh!

48:00.875 --> 48:02.708
- Fair dinkum.
- Fair dinkum?

48:02.750 --> 48:05.167
That's what I said, yeah.

48:05.250 --> 48:07.083
Fair dinkum.

48:07.167 --> 48:10.042
Wow. Poor little fella.

48:14.292 --> 48:18.250
- So, um, where do you live?
- Oh, I get around, you know.

48:18.333 --> 48:21.292
Never know where I might pop up.

48:25.417 --> 48:28.792
- Man, you must love the freedom.
- What?

48:28.875 --> 48:31.958
The freedom.
You know, you must love it.

48:32.958 --> 48:35.250
You know, hangin' out
in nature and shit.

48:35.333 --> 48:37.792
- Right.
- Yeah.

48:37.875 --> 48:42.708
You get to, like,
you know, cruise around the bush.

48:42.750 --> 48:48.375
Saying cool stuff like,
"that's not a knife, this is a knife."

48:51.417 --> 48:53.833
You know
what I'm talking about? Yeah?

49:03.000 --> 49:06.333
What do you actually do... now?

49:10.500 --> 49:14.875
Oh, I could tell ya,
but then I'd have to kill ya.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.875
So you don't really
shoot kangaroos, do you?

49:27.917 --> 49:31.375
I'm doing people a service
by taking out a few roos.

49:31.458 --> 49:33.542
They're everywhere out here now.

49:33.625 --> 49:35.417
Like tourists.

49:48.333 --> 49:50.542
Oh. Excusez moi.

49:51.833 --> 49:54.708
Oi.

49:54.792 --> 49:57.292
Oi. Your turn.

50:06.875 --> 50:09.042
Fair go.

50:09.083 --> 50:10.625
Bloody women here, son.

50:17.208 --> 50:20.958
Well, um, I'll let you know when
I get it goin'. What do ya reckon?

50:21.042 --> 50:23.500
- Thank you.
- No worries.

50:23.583 --> 50:26.167
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

50:30.750 --> 50:32.208
"But then I'd have to kill ya."

50:33.167 --> 50:34.333
Shh.

50:35.833 --> 50:36.833
What?

50:36.917 --> 50:38.750
Did you see the way
he was looking at you?

50:38.833 --> 50:41.583
He's trying to impress us
with his great white hunter thing.

50:41.667 --> 50:44.750
But he's doing us a favor.
He probably doesn't appreciate us

50:44.833 --> 50:47.208
cracking jokes at his expense.
Seriously.

50:48.792 --> 50:51.583
- Let's get the car fixed.
- That's what we're doing.

50:51.667 --> 50:53.375
Don't freak out.

51:06.917 --> 51:09.833
- You all right?
- Fine, thanks.

51:12.042 --> 51:14.083
Thanks again for helping us out.

51:14.250 --> 51:15.792
No worries.

51:18.833 --> 51:21.917
Obviously, it'd be great
to get going as soon as possible.

51:23.917 --> 51:25.750
No worries.

51:59.375 --> 52:00.875
Ben.

52:00.958 --> 52:03.875
Ben, move the Esky
away from the fire.

52:06.167 --> 52:08.167
Ben.

53:32.083 --> 53:33.542
Oh!

56:58.958 --> 57:00.500
No!

57:00.583 --> 57:03.542
No! Aah!

58:16.750 --> 58:17.958
Please don't kill me.

58:18.042 --> 58:19.292
Please.

58:19.375 --> 58:23.042
Please! Aah!

58:25.375 --> 58:27.333
Please!

58:28.792 --> 58:30.833
Don't kill me! Please!

58:30.917 --> 58:32.958
No!

58:33.042 --> 58:35.458
Don't kill me!

58:41.208 --> 58:42.250
Bang!

58:49.417 --> 58:52.083
Well, nothing happens
when the bolt's open, you see?

58:55.458 --> 58:57.083
Uh-oh!

59:11.458 --> 59:13.667
The look on your fuckin' face!

59:13.750 --> 59:16.792
Why are you doing this?

59:16.875 --> 59:18.750
Why?

59:18.833 --> 59:21.708
Please! If you let me go,
I won't tell anyone.

59:21.792 --> 59:24.083
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I won't! I won't!

59:24.167 --> 59:26.333
Come on. Oalm down.

59:26.417 --> 59:28.167
Listen to Uncle Michael.

59:28.250 --> 59:30.500
Come on.

59:30.542 --> 59:32.958
Now, as I keep tellin' ya,

59:33.042 --> 59:36.125
you know, I always
use a rubber with you cunts.

59:37.333 --> 59:40.167
I don't know where you been.

59:40.250 --> 59:42.042
Fuck you!

59:42.083 --> 59:43.417
Mmm.

59:43.500 --> 59:46.000
Mmm!

59:48.417 --> 59:50.542
Mmm!

01:00:01.083 --> 01:00:02.708
Get away from me!

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.375
Fuck you!

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:10.208
Fuck you, cunt!

01:00:10.292 --> 01:00:11.292
No!

01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:14.000
Aah!

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:19.875
Fuck you, cunt!

01:00:19.958 --> 01:00:22.042
You fucking loser!

01:00:22.125 --> 01:00:24.375
You fucking loser.

01:00:24.417 --> 01:00:26.083
Thank you very much.

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.667
You know...

01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:34.375
You know how I know
that you're not gonna tell nobody?

01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:35.667
You know how I know?

01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:40.083
No! No!

01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:44.958
Off with your little pinkies.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.417
Fuck!

01:01:32.458 --> 01:01:33.500
Ah!

01:01:33.542 --> 01:01:36.042
Jesus Ohrist, Mick!

01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:38.625
Rule number one.
Put the bloody fire out.

01:01:38.708 --> 01:01:39.958
For fuck's sake!

01:01:40.042 --> 01:01:41.792
Bloody hell!

01:02:00.833 --> 01:02:02.292
Shh! Kristy!

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:05.000
Shh! Shh!

01:02:05.083 --> 01:02:07.042
Please! Shh!

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.417
Shh! Shh!

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.458
Where's Ben?
Where's Ben?

01:02:15.542 --> 01:02:18.125
Shh. Kristy, you have to be quiet.

01:02:27.917 --> 01:02:29.042
Shh!

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:37.333
Oh. You're still awake, are ya?

01:02:37.417 --> 01:02:39.875
You know, a man's a real goose, eh?

01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:41.208
I mean, it took four hours

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:43.625
to get those fuckin' parts
out of your car, right?

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:45.625
Now the bastard thing's all burnt.

01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:47.875
What do ya think of that?

01:02:51.417 --> 01:02:54.000
Bloody this, all.

01:02:57.583 --> 01:02:59.167
Now...

01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:03.333
Where were we?

01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:05.542
Eh?

01:03:05.625 --> 01:03:07.208
Oh, yeah.

01:03:10.542 --> 01:03:12.958
Let's play. Hey?

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:32.583
You like to play, don't ya?

01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:35.000
You like to play, hey?
Hey? Hey?

01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:37.667
You like to play, do ya?
Hey? Hey?

01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:43.542
That stupid bitch over there.
See that stupid bitch over there?

01:03:43.583 --> 01:03:44.833
She loved it.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.208
While she lasted.
Good few months.

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:51.083
We were great together, you know?

01:03:51.167 --> 01:03:52.750
Till she lost her head!

01:03:58.542 --> 01:04:00.667
How about...

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:03.083
How about I cut your tits off, hey?

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.750
Out your tits off.

01:04:06.833 --> 01:04:09.458
You're all the same,
you foreign cunts.

01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:12.125
Weak as piss.

01:04:21.542 --> 01:04:23.167
Now, how the hell did you get out?

01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:26.042
You're wasting your time, eh?

01:04:26.167 --> 01:04:30.000
It's not loaded.
I only put one up the spout.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:32.417
Let her go.

01:04:34.083 --> 01:04:35.417
Now!

01:04:37.417 --> 01:04:39.000
Get away from her!

01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:40.542
Now!

01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:41.917
Now, Lizzy.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.958
Now, a rifle in the wrong hands can be,
you know, really dangerous.

01:04:46.042 --> 01:04:48.375
So, give me the fuckin'...

01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:00.792
Kill him!

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:09.083
Kill him!

01:05:13.917 --> 01:05:15.000
No!

01:05:35.542 --> 01:05:37.250
Please help me.

01:05:56.542 --> 01:05:58.208
Come on.

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:15.083
No! No!

01:06:15.167 --> 01:06:16.667
Where are you going?

01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:18.417
Where are you going?

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.458
Don't go!

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.208
Yes!

01:07:29.042 --> 01:07:30.875
Hang onto something!

01:07:48.875 --> 01:07:50.458
Go!

01:08:35.667 --> 01:08:37.167
Come on!

01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:44.582
Go, go, go, Liz!

01:08:54.417 --> 01:08:56.207
Go, go!

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.457
Come on.

01:09:43.082 --> 01:09:45.542
- Push!
- What?

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.125
He'll see the lights go over!

01:10:19.667 --> 01:10:24.042
- Follow me.
- Are you joking?

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:25.125
Come on.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:57.208
He's going to check on us.

01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:58.750
Let's go.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:10.917
Fuck!

01:12:12.917 --> 01:12:15.167
He killed that person back there.

01:12:15.208 --> 01:12:16.917
Did you see Ben?

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:20.167
She'd been alive for months.

01:12:20.875 --> 01:12:23.375
We've got to move.

01:12:23.417 --> 01:12:27.208
- He's going to do that to us.
- We can't go that way.

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:30.333
- He's gonna see we're not down there.
- I know, I know!

01:12:32.917 --> 01:12:34.042
I've got a set of keys.

01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:36.542
- He must have more cars.
- I'm not going back there.

01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:39.542
We're in the middle of fucking nowhere.
We need a car.

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:45.458
Come on.

01:13:11.042 --> 01:13:12.792
Wait. Wait.

01:13:13.958 --> 01:13:15.083
- Wait.
- You all right?

01:13:15.167 --> 01:13:17.333
I just gotta catch my breath. Wait.

01:13:17.833 --> 01:13:19.583
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:21.333
It's all right. It's all right.

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:29.333
Listen, Kris.

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:32.208
You're just gonna have to wait
here for a minute, all right?

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.333
No!

01:13:33.417 --> 01:13:36.208
- No!
- Listen, it's just for five minutes.

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:38.333
- Please, don't leave me. Please!
- Listen.

01:13:38.417 --> 01:13:41.125
- What if he catches me again?
- He won't, he won't.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:42.667
Please, don't leave me!

01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:45.792
He's not going to
catch you again, all right?

01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:48.292
You just have to wait here
for five minutes, OK?

01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:51.042
I'll be in and out.
I'll be quicker on my own, OK?

01:13:51.083 --> 01:13:52.250
Listen.

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:55.792
Look...

01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:58.875
If I'm not back, all right,
in five minutes,

01:13:58.917 --> 01:14:01.625
just head that way, OK?

01:14:01.708 --> 01:14:03.958
And you'll hit a road
eventually, all right?

01:14:04.042 --> 01:14:06.250
I'll catch up with you.

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:09.625
OK. I'm quicker on my own.
All right? I'm coming back.

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:11.500
- OK?
- Wait.

01:14:11.542 --> 01:14:12.792
- Please.
- Five minutes.

01:14:12.875 --> 01:14:14.208
It's OK.
It's all right.

01:14:15.917 --> 01:14:17.958
- Don't go!
- It's all right.

01:14:18.042 --> 01:14:20.167
What if he catches me again?

01:14:20.208 --> 01:14:21.708
He's not...
He's not gonna...

01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:24.083
He's not gonna catch you again,
all right?

01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:25.542
Listen.

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:29.625
Listen, you just wait here, all right?

01:14:29.708 --> 01:14:33.083
Please hurry.

01:17:27.833 --> 01:17:30.042
Shit!

01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:34.375
Oh, God.

01:18:05.417 --> 01:18:07.375
Uhh!

01:18:16.167 --> 01:18:17.500
Uhh...

01:18:18.542 --> 01:18:20.667
Ahh!

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:51.042
Ben?

01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:01.500
Ben.

01:21:14.417 --> 01:21:17.125
<i>It's excellent.
Yeah, I've never seen better.</i>

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:20.000
<i>Bella, bella, bellal</i>

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:23.000
<i>I'm sure we did.
I thought we got this fixed.</i>

01:21:23.042 --> 01:21:27.208
<i>Honey, I'm not in the mood, all right?</i>

01:21:29.333 --> 01:21:32.708
<i>- How's it going, mate?
- Not too good.</i>

01:21:35.333 --> 01:21:36.625
<i>What do you expect?</i>

01:21:36.708 --> 01:21:38.833
<i>He's from the country.
That's what happens.</i>

01:21:38.917 --> 01:21:40.792
<i>Country people are friendly, though.</i>

01:21:44.208 --> 01:21:45.458
<i>- Thirsty, are ya?
- Yeah.</i>

01:21:45.542 --> 01:21:49.750
<i>Eh? Nothing like rainwater
from the top end.</i>

01:22:06.875 --> 01:22:10.500
<i>So far, no sign
of intelligent life forms.</i>

01:22:10.542 --> 01:22:12.750
<i>Um, do you wanna say hello?</i>

01:22:12.833 --> 01:22:14.583
<i>- Righto. What's your name?
- Graham.</i>

01:22:14.667 --> 01:22:16.667
<i>Graham.
Nice to meet you, Graham.</i>

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:17.958
<i>I'm Ben.</i>

01:22:18.042 --> 01:22:20.208
<i>- This one too?
- Yeah, man.</i>

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:22.708
Ah!

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Hey.

01:23:41.208 --> 01:23:43.875
Like your little mate said before,
you know.

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:46.750
That's not a knife.

01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:49.917
This is a knife.

01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:58.000
Now, come on.
Come on, Lizzie.

01:23:58.042 --> 01:23:59.292
Come on!

01:23:59.375 --> 01:24:00.625
Settle down, you know.

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:03.042
That's not gonna kill ya. All right?

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:06.542
I got a bullet hole in me neck
and I'm not whingeing, am I? No.

01:24:08.542 --> 01:24:10.875
I'm gonna have to do something, Lizzy.

01:24:10.958 --> 01:24:14.458
So as you don't try
and run out on me, you know?

01:24:14.542 --> 01:24:18.125
It's... It's a little trick they used to
use in the Vietnam War, you know?

01:24:18.208 --> 01:24:19.583
So they could take prisoners

01:24:19.667 --> 01:24:22.250
and they still get the same
information out of 'em.

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:25.000
But the little buggers didn't escape.
You with me?

01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:26.792
You with me?

01:24:27.125 --> 01:24:29.125
You see what I mean? Eh?

01:24:31.208 --> 01:24:32.333
No! No!

01:24:34.875 --> 01:24:36.542
Now that!

01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:39.625
That's for fuckin' wreckin'
me fuckin' truck, you bitch!

01:24:46.167 --> 01:24:49.083
Now, this little procedure...

01:24:50.417 --> 01:24:53.208
...is called "making a head on a stick."

01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:57.417
Because once your
spine's severed, right...

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.000
No!

01:25:07.208 --> 01:25:09.167
That's what you are, hey?

01:25:10.542 --> 01:25:13.292
Head on a stick.

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:16.792
Now...

01:25:17.042 --> 01:25:21.042
Let's talk about your little mate,
um, Kristy.

01:25:29.042 --> 01:25:30.542
Liz.

01:25:34.417 --> 01:25:35.917
Liz.

01:28:04.375 --> 01:28:05.708
What happened?

01:28:07.042 --> 01:28:08.083
Jesus.

01:28:11.833 --> 01:28:14.583
I'll get a blanket.
Get you some help.

01:29:16.667 --> 01:29:18.458
No! No!

01:29:26.375 --> 01:29:27.458
Oh!

01:30:07.542 --> 01:30:09.667
Come on! Move!

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:23.167
Come on! Come on!

01:30:27.917 --> 01:30:30.125
Come on! Fucking move!

01:30:30.375 --> 01:30:33.292
Move! Come on! Fuck!

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:41.208
Come on!

01:30:41.333 --> 01:30:45.292
No! No, no!

01:30:47.167 --> 01:30:49.042
No.

01:31:00.708 --> 01:31:04.083
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:05.500
Asshole!

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.875
Oh, fuck! No!

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:55.667
The winner!

01:36:58.042 --> 01:37:00.417
Help!
