00:33.220 --> 00:40.490
<b>Do you all remember the Red Ribbon Army?</b>

00:40.490 --> 00:46.710
<b>Under the leadership of Commander Red, this evil army plotted world domination</b>

00:46.710 --> 00:53.590
<b>but was wiped out by a single boy by the name of Son Goku.</b>

00:56.320 --> 01:07.680
<b>At the time, the brilliant scientist Dr. Gero, who was developing special weapons called 'androids', managed to survive.</b>

01:07.680 --> 01:14.830
<b>Meanwhile, Commander Red's orphaned son Magenta carried on his father's will.</b>

01:14.830 --> 01:22.980
<b>Using the enormous funds from his front company Red Pharmaceuticals, he quietly awaited the army's revival.</b>

01:22.980 --> 01:24.550
<b>Time passed.</b>

01:24.550 --> 01:28.820
<b>Dr. Gero carried on developing his androids in secret</b>

01:28.820 --> 01:32.530
<b>and even converted himself into an android.</b>

01:32.530 --> 01:35.040
<b>Yet he was once again defeated by Goku and his allies</b>

01:35.040 --> 01:40.640
<b>and finally killed by his own creation, Android #17.</b>

01:42.290 --> 01:51.500
<b>Soon afterwards, Goku and co. faced off against Cell, the ultimate living weapon</b>

01:51.510 --> 01:54.840
<b>and finally managed to defeat him after a difficult struggle.</b>

01:57.150 --> 02:04.460
<b>While Magenta nearly gave up on the Red Ribbon Army's revival after these numerous setbacks</b>

02:04.460 --> 02:11.040
<b>he was fortunate enough to discover
Dr. Gero's even more brilliant grandson, Dr. Hedo.</b>

02:11.040 --> 02:18.150
<b>Thanks to Hedo's genius, Magenta's burning desire for revenge blazed forth once more.</b>

03:21.920 --> 03:24.920
<b>So this is Dr. Gero's grandson?</b>

03:27.760 --> 03:30.400
<b>Dr. Hedo, age 24.</b>

03:32.840 --> 03:35.740
<b>Is he a professor, or a medical doctor?</b>

03:35.740 --> 03:40.010
<b>He holds both qualifications. Observe.</b>

03:41.350 --> 03:43.660
<b>"Carmine Presents"</b>

03:45.530 --> 03:47.670
<b>Did you make this?</b>

03:47.670 --> 03:48.670
<b>Indeed.</b>

03:49.430 --> 03:52.540
<b>His father was the younger son of Dr. Gero's late wife.</b>

03:52.550 --> 03:56.780
<b>When Hedo was in elementary school, he lost both of his parents in an accident.</b>

03:56.780 --> 04:00.590
<b>While Hedo was still a child, he used his inheritance to live on his own.</b>

04:00.590 --> 04:03.770
<b>He was brilliant enough to obtain his doctorate at the age of 14.</b>

04:03.770 --> 04:09.070
<b>However, his eccentric personality prevented him from fitting in at any laboratories</b>

04:09.070 --> 04:13.590
<b>so it seems he used his scant remaining inheritance to continue his research on his own.</b>

04:13.590 --> 04:18.560
<b>That suits our purposes. Let's headhunt him right away.</b>

04:20.090 --> 04:21.730
<b>Bring me some tea!</b>

04:21.730 --> 04:23.000
<b>Right away.</b>

04:23.010 --> 04:24.680
<b>Please wait three months.</b>

04:24.680 --> 04:25.680
<b>For the tea?</b>

04:25.680 --> 04:30.110
<b>No, for Dr. Hedo. He is currently serving time in prison.</b>

04:30.110 --> 04:31.320
<b>Pardon me.</b>

04:31.320 --> 04:33.960
<b>He's in prison? What for?</b>

04:33.960 --> 04:40.900
<b>Well… It seems he stole three corpses from a morgue and turned them into simplistic androids</b>

04:40.900 --> 04:44.120
<b>then earned money by having them work at a convenience store.</b>

04:44.120 --> 04:48.420
<b>I can't tell if he's a genius or an idiot. Either way...</b>

04:48.420 --> 04:54.670
<b>It looks like he shares Dr. Gero's talent for android technology.</b>

04:58.610 --> 05:03.660
<b>A-Anyway, we need his skills in order to revive the Red Ribbon Army!</b>

05:03.660 --> 05:04.860
<b>H-HOT!</b>

05:18.010 --> 05:19.480
<b>Dumbass!</b>

05:19.480 --> 05:21.280
<b>Dirtbag!</b>

05:37.120 --> 05:40.820
<b>Are you Dr. Hedo? I've been waiting for you.</b>

05:41.990 --> 05:44.140
<b>How rude of me. Allow me to introduce mys—</b>

05:44.140 --> 05:46.300
<b>You're the president of Red Pharmaceuticals, right?</b>

05:51.210 --> 05:51.740
<b>Hey!</b>

05:53.790 --> 05:57.530
<b>How do you know who I am?</b>

05:57.530 --> 05:59.230
<b>I've looked into you.</b>

05:59.230 --> 06:00.860
<b>Looked into me?</b>

06:00.860 --> 06:02.700
<b>You there in the driver's seat.</b>

06:02.700 --> 06:07.910
<b>You watched me when I was out in the prison exercise yard, didn't you?</b>

06:07.910 --> 06:11.020
<b>I thought it was fishy, so I had you followed.</b>

06:11.020 --> 06:12.580
<b>How?</b>

06:14.160 --> 06:16.560
<b>Hachi-Maru, come here!</b>

06:23.950 --> 06:28.150
<b>He's my cyborg agent. I made him by modifying a bee.</b>

06:28.150 --> 06:34.500
<b>He followed you into the president's office at Red Pharmaceuticals and watched you report on me.</b>

06:34.500 --> 06:36.340
<b>How astonishing.</b>

06:36.340 --> 06:39.440
<b>Still, I bet you don't know the reason we've been investigating you.</b>

06:39.440 --> 06:42.040
<b>I can guess.</b>

06:42.040 --> 06:44.390
<b>Your conversation was a bit hard to make out</b>

06:44.390 --> 06:48.260
<b>but I managed to hear you say 'Red Ribbon Army'.</b>

06:48.260 --> 06:51.830
<b>Well… At any rate, let us give you a lift.</b>

06:51.830 --> 06:55.240
<b>We know all your favorite foods.</b>

06:56.310 --> 06:58.780
<b>Scoot over a bit.</b>

06:58.780 --> 07:00.780
<b>Fasten your seatbelt.</b>

07:05.560 --> 07:07.630
<b>How were things in prison?</b>

07:07.630 --> 07:10.570
<b>Did the other inmates pick on you?</b>

07:10.570 --> 07:13.240
<b>Some of them did, at first.</b>

07:13.240 --> 07:17.420
<b>But they all died mysteriously!</b>

07:17.420 --> 07:19.490
<b>I… I see.</b>

07:19.490 --> 07:24.290
<b>It's a shame what happened to your grandfather, Dr. Gero.</b>

07:24.300 --> 07:26.600
<b>Frankly, I don't care.</b>

07:26.600 --> 07:30.880
<b>I was still a kid at the time. I'm not sure how he died.</b>

07:30.880 --> 07:33.980
<b>And I never even met him.</b>

07:33.990 --> 07:37.290
<b>Still, by a remarkable coincidence</b>

07:37.290 --> 07:40.430
<b>your enthusiasm for android research is as great as your grandfather.</b>

07:40.430 --> 07:42.800
<b>Research on making the ultimate android, yeah?</b>

07:44.080 --> 07:47.040
<b>Marvelous! That's exactly what I'm after.</b>

07:47.650 --> 07:50.750
<b>It was a major setback to lose such a genius.</b>

07:50.750 --> 07:55.600
<b>After my father Red died, I financed his research.</b>

07:55.600 --> 07:57.000
<b>I get the picture.</b>

07:57.000 --> 07:59.230
<b>Now that the genius Dr. Gero is gone</b>

07:59.230 --> 08:03.200
<b>you want to replace him with the super genius Dr. Hedo.</b>

08:03.200 --> 08:07.520
<b>Exactly. Well, how about it? Will you lend me a hand?</b>

08:07.520 --> 08:10.690
<b>You can have all the research funds and equipment you want.</b>

08:10.690 --> 08:13.960
<b>I'll pay you 300 million per android!</b>

08:13.970 --> 08:15.970
<b>Hmm…I'm not so sure.</b>

08:16.640 --> 08:18.040
<b>Why not?</b>

08:18.040 --> 08:25.720
<b>While it's not public knowledge, Red Pharmaceuticals is a front for the Red Ribbon Army. That's where all its money comes from, right?</b>

08:25.720 --> 08:32.000
<b>When I was a kid, my parents hated grandfather for being influenced by the Red Ribbon Army.</b>

08:32.630 --> 08:36.780
<b>Wow, I never expected you to know so much.</b>

08:36.780 --> 08:41.050
<b>And besides, I'm a big fan of strong, cool superheroes.</b>

08:41.050 --> 08:45.660
<b>If the Red Ribbon Army is still after world domination like in the old days</b>

08:45.660 --> 08:48.300
<b>that makes them the natural enemy of superheroes, right?</b>

08:49.770 --> 08:51.900
<b>You're an interesting man.</b>

08:51.900 --> 08:54.570
<b>While it may seem like world domination</b>

08:54.580 --> 08:59.420
<b>my true goal is to purge the world of dangerous or rebellious individuals</b>

08:59.420 --> 09:03.790
<b>in order to establish an honest society and a peaceful world.</b>

09:03.790 --> 09:06.700
<b>In a certain sense, I'm on the side of justice.</b>

09:06.700 --> 09:12.680
<b>In other words, you want to use force to create your ideal world?</b>

09:12.680 --> 09:15.560
<b>Well, I don't care about having authority.</b>

09:15.560 --> 09:18.090
<b>I'm only interested in research.</b>

09:18.090 --> 09:24.800
<b>If you're feeling reluctant, then how about I pay you one billion per android?</b>

09:24.810 --> 09:26.510
<b>Seems like an offer I can't refuse.</b>

09:26.510 --> 09:27.710
<b>Perhaps.</b>

09:27.710 --> 09:29.850
<b>Guess I've got no choice then.</b>

09:29.850 --> 09:33.250
<b>Indeed, this is in your best interest.</b>

09:33.250 --> 09:36.660
<b>For the record, I'm not agreeing simply because you held me at gunpoint.</b>

09:36.660 --> 09:42.400
<b>I've injected my skin with a special drug that makes it impervious to shocks.</b>

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
<b>And besides…</b>

09:44.400 --> 09:47.520
<b>Hachi-Maru's poison stinger is deadly!</b>

09:47.520 --> 09:52.690
<b>Even for an android, as long as some part of them remains human, I doubt they could survive a single sting.</b>

09:56.140 --> 09:58.170
<b>The only reason I'm agreeing</b>

09:58.170 --> 10:04.080
<b>is because I love the idea of having a big budget to build the best androids in history!</b>

10:04.080 --> 10:08.790
<b>Just so we're clear, I have no interest in President Magenta's ambitions.</b>

10:08.790 --> 10:09.990
<b>Got that?</b>

10:09.990 --> 10:11.530
<b>Fine, fine!</b>

10:15.480 --> 10:17.680
<b>So, who's the biggest enemy you have in mind?</b>

10:18.980 --> 10:21.350
<b>It's the group who defeated Cell.</b>

10:21.350 --> 10:23.280
<b>What, you mean Mister Satan?</b>

10:23.280 --> 10:25.650
<b>No, not quite.</b>

10:25.660 --> 10:28.300
<b>He's affiliated with them, but according to our investigation</b>

10:28.300 --> 10:33.400
<b>they are a fearsome secret society whose true leader is Bulma of Capsule Corporation.</b>

10:33.400 --> 10:37.480
<b>Capsule Corporation? The richest company in the world?</b>

10:37.480 --> 10:40.050
<b>I've never heard a single nasty rumor about them.</b>

10:40.050 --> 10:41.420
<b>There's no doubt it.</b>

10:41.420 --> 10:48.270
<b>Numerous witnesses have seen flying humanoids coming in and out of Capsule Corporation HQ.</b>

10:48.270 --> 10:51.910
<b>Our investigation shows that these are most likely aliens.</b>

10:51.910 --> 10:53.080
<b>Aliens?</b>

10:53.080 --> 10:55.250
<b>That's right. Think about it!</b>

10:55.260 --> 11:01.160
<b>Do you really think they could have created their revolutionary Capsule system or spaceships without the help of alien technology?</b>

11:01.160 --> 11:07.810
<b>These aliens are planning to use Capsule Corporation to take over the Earth!</b>

11:07.810 --> 11:10.050
<b>That's an unbelievable story.</b>

11:10.050 --> 11:12.080
<b>I figured you'd say that.</b>

11:12.080 --> 11:15.890
<b>But look at this. It was taken several years ago.</b>

11:15.900 --> 11:18.270
<b>Did you ever imagine such beings existed?</b>

11:18.270 --> 11:23.070
<b>They're aliens! Aliens have battled each other right here on Earth.</b>

11:23.070 --> 11:26.580
<b>Most likely to decide who had the right to claim Earth as their territory.</b>

11:26.580 --> 11:29.950
<b>It seems that this is when Bulma's organization was first established.</b>

11:29.950 --> 11:36.470
<b>But in that case, why don't Bulma and her minions just take over the Earth by force?</b>

11:36.470 --> 11:41.310
<b>Obviously they want to use Earthlings as a labor force.</b>

11:41.310 --> 11:44.550
<b>Once they've made Earth into a paradise for themselves</b>

11:44.550 --> 11:50.090
<b>they'll exterminate us Earthlings and summon their alien friends.</b>

11:50.090 --> 11:54.160
<b>Cell was your grandfather's masterpiece.</b>

11:54.160 --> 11:59.650
<b>He sent forth Cell to fight back against Capsule Corporation and their plot to hoard the world's wealth for themselves</b>

11:59.650 --> 12:04.520
<b>with the help of their secret alien organization.</b>

12:04.520 --> 12:07.500
<b>But sadly, he died in the attempt.</b>

12:07.500 --> 12:14.840
<b>Even Androids #17 and #18 betrayed their creator and joined the enemy.</b>

12:14.840 --> 12:17.580
<b>They sound like pretty tough foes.</b>

12:17.580 --> 12:24.220
<b>Indeed. Their organization even includes the fearsome Majin Buu and the great demon king Piccolo.</b>

12:24.220 --> 12:27.640
<b>Is the famous Dr. Bulma an alien as well?</b>

12:28.810 --> 12:30.240
<b>Most likely.</b>

12:38.930 --> 12:42.060
<b>Sounds like what we need is some heroes.</b>

12:42.060 --> 12:44.100
<b>Exactly right.</b>

12:44.100 --> 12:48.980
<b>Can you create androids strong enough to defeat them?</b>

12:50.350 --> 12:52.750
<b>What a dumb question.</b>

12:52.750 --> 12:55.290
<b>I've got a new goal now:</b>

12:55.290 --> 12:59.470
<b>to build the most powerful androids in the universe!</b>

12:59.470 --> 13:01.100
<b>Cool, right?</b>

13:01.100 --> 13:02.640
<b>Y-Yeah…</b>

13:02.640 --> 13:06.080
<b>Alright! The return of the Red Ribbon Army is at hand!</b>

13:32.160 --> 13:33.460
<b>Ow!</b>

13:33.460 --> 13:34.630
<b>Are you OK?</b>

13:34.630 --> 13:35.900
<b>No problem!</b>

13:35.900 --> 13:38.310
<b>Alright, that's enough for today.</b>

13:42.620 --> 13:43.750
<b>Here!</b>

13:50.100 --> 13:51.800
<b>You're doing well.</b>

13:51.800 --> 13:56.270
<b>I'd almost say you've got a better knack for this than Gohan…I mean, than your father.</b>

13:56.280 --> 14:00.620
<b>Then teach me how to fire <i>ki</i> blasts from my hands.</b>

14:00.620 --> 14:02.990
<b>Like Goten-<i>kun</i> and Trunks-<i>kun</i> do.</b>

14:02.990 --> 14:07.370
<b>I've already told you: things like that only come once you've perfected the basics.</b>

14:07.370 --> 14:09.140
<b>Why, you can't even fly yet!</b>

14:09.140 --> 14:10.640
<b>It's so hard!</b>

14:10.640 --> 14:11.910
<b>Of course it's hard.</b>

14:11.910 --> 14:12.610
<b>Bah!</b>

14:12.610 --> 14:13.510
<b>But give it a try.</b>

14:28.280 --> 14:30.250
<b>Don't strain yourself. Focus on your desire!</b>

14:30.250 --> 14:33.150
<b>If you do that, your <i>ki</i> will obey you.</b>

14:34.790 --> 14:36.190
<b>It's no use!</b>

14:37.030 --> 14:38.730
<b>There's no hurry.</b>

14:38.730 --> 14:41.940
<b>You're still only three years old. You've got plenty of time.</b>

14:41.940 --> 14:45.540
<b>Besides, you have Saiyan blood.</b>

14:45.540 --> 14:48.220
<b>It will be simple once you get the hang of it.</b>

14:49.390 --> 14:50.750
<b>Hey, Piccolo-<i>san</i>.</b>

14:50.750 --> 14:51.760
<b>What is it?</b>

14:51.760 --> 14:55.530
<b>Is it true that Papa could be stronger than Grandpa if he wanted?</b>

14:55.530 --> 14:58.670
<b>Grandpa? You mean Goku?</b>

14:58.670 --> 15:02.640
<b>Yeah, it's true. Though these days I'm not so sure.</b>

15:03.780 --> 15:06.980
<b>I've never even seen Papa fight.</b>

15:06.990 --> 15:09.060
<b>He hasn't needed to.</b>

15:09.060 --> 15:11.730
<b>But he will, if the time comes.</b>

15:13.530 --> 15:15.700
<b>Let's head back. You're going to be late.</b>

15:16.940 --> 15:20.250
<b>OK, I'll come back once kindergarten is over!</b>

15:56.010 --> 15:57.010
<b>What is it, Videl?</b>

15:57.020 --> 15:59.090
<b>Oh, Piccolo-<i>san</i>! Good morning!</b>

15:59.090 --> 16:02.960
<b>Say, are you free this afternoon?</b>

16:02.960 --> 16:07.370
<b>The afternoon? Well, I'm always busy training, but… what do you want?</b>

16:07.380 --> 16:11.620
<b>The martial arts class I teach has a tournament today</b>

16:11.620 --> 16:14.950
<b>so I can't pick Pan up from kindergarten.</b>

16:14.950 --> 16:19.330
<b>If you don't mind, could you go pick her up for me?</b>

16:19.330 --> 16:20.500
<b>What about Gohan?</b>

16:20.500 --> 16:25.270
<b>He's busy writing the next research report he'll be presenting.</b>

16:25.270 --> 16:27.770
<b>He hasn't left his room in days.</b>

16:27.780 --> 16:29.950
<b>That idiot! Not again.</b>

16:29.950 --> 16:31.820
<b>Piccolo-<i>san</i>, please.</b>

16:31.820 --> 16:32.620
<b>Fine.</b>

16:32.620 --> 16:34.760
<b>Thanks! You're a huge help!</b>

16:34.760 --> 16:38.160
<b>Pick her up at 3, OK? I'll bring you back something tasty.</b>

16:38.170 --> 16:40.310
<b>I've told you, I only drink water!</b>

16:40.310 --> 16:41.610
<b>Oh, that's right.</b>

16:41.610 --> 16:44.680
<b>In that case, I'll buy you another cute stuffed animal!</b>

16:47.590 --> 16:50.390
<b>W-Why always stuffed animals?...</b>

16:57.480 --> 16:58.850
<b>Piccolo-<i>san</i>!</b>

17:00.180 --> 17:03.650
<b>Sorry, looks like we need you to go pick up Pan again.</b>

17:03.650 --> 17:06.390
<b>Give me a break! What do you think you're doing?!</b>

17:06.390 --> 17:08.570
<b>I'm writing a report on insects…</b>

17:08.570 --> 17:13.100
<b>A little while ago, an amazing type of ant was discovered on a southern island.</b>

17:13.100 --> 17:17.770
<b>When in danger, this ant gives off a faint glow and transforms.</b>

17:17.780 --> 17:19.990
<b>Doesn't it remind you of a Super Saiyan?</b>

17:19.990 --> 17:22.160
<b>I wasn't asking about that!</b>

17:22.160 --> 17:27.730
<b>I was asking if your research is really more important than going to pick up your kid?!</b>

17:27.740 --> 17:31.170
<b>N-No… But then, we've got you around to help out, right Piccolo?</b>

17:33.640 --> 17:37.250
<b>And how about doing a little training every now and then?!</b>

17:37.250 --> 17:39.830
<b>You never know when another crisis will come.</b>

17:39.830 --> 17:43.230
<b>Gee, you really think something like that might happen again?</b>

17:43.230 --> 17:47.940
<b>Still, even if it does, there's always Dad and Vegeta—</b>

17:49.880 --> 17:51.880
<b>I still haven't lost my edge!</b>

18:00.670 --> 18:02.000
<b>S-So heavy!</b>

18:02.000 --> 18:04.200
<b>Well? Bring back any memories?</b>

18:04.200 --> 18:06.810
<b>It… It'll be hard to work like this.</b>

18:06.810 --> 18:09.650
<b>Don't whine. I'll go get Pan.</b>

18:09.650 --> 18:12.520
<b>Sheesh, she's your own kid!</b>

18:12.520 --> 18:16.390
<b>I really am sorry! We'll buy another stuffed animal for you!</b>

18:16.390 --> 18:19.070
<b>No! When did I ever say I liked those things?!</b>

18:22.680 --> 18:25.950
<b>Piccolo-<i>san's</i> sure in a bad mood.</b>

18:47.290 --> 18:49.670
<b>You're interfering with my training.</b>

18:55.470 --> 18:57.840
<b>You must be the great demon king Piccolo.</b>

18:59.590 --> 19:02.590
<b>Sorry, I'm just Piccolo now.</b>

19:02.590 --> 19:03.990
<b>What's that supposed to mean?</b>

19:03.990 --> 19:10.140
<b>Long story. And who are you, in that cheesy old hero outfit?</b>

19:10.140 --> 19:14.280
<b>Geez, you could at least call it 'retro'.</b>

19:14.280 --> 19:17.010
<b>And unfortunately for you, my identity…</b>

19:19.030 --> 19:20.430
<b>Is still a secret!</b>

19:25.470 --> 19:28.870
<b>That mark… I remember it from back when I was a god.</b>

19:28.880 --> 19:32.120
<b>Doesn't it belong to the Red Ribbon Army?</b>

19:32.120 --> 19:35.620
<b>Ah man, I blew it!</b>

19:35.620 --> 19:38.860
<b>By the way…what do you mean 'back when you were a god'?</b>

19:38.870 --> 19:42.470
<b>Ha! You should've done your homework. Why should I tell you?</b>

19:42.470 --> 19:44.140
<b>Such a tightwad!</b>

19:44.140 --> 19:47.640
<b>The Red Ribbon Army was wiped out ages ago.</b>

19:47.640 --> 19:52.890
<b>Doctor Gero hung on for a bit longer, but all his plans failed in the end.</b>

19:52.890 --> 19:54.690
<b>And that includes Cell.</b>

19:55.930 --> 19:59.360
<b>I just came today for some friendly sparring...</b>

19:59.370 --> 20:01.340
<b>but it looks like I can't leave it at that anymore.</b>

20:01.340 --> 20:03.210
<b>I can't sense your <i>ki</i>.</b>

20:03.210 --> 20:05.680
<b>You must be a robot or an android.</b>

20:05.680 --> 20:07.380
<b>Who built you?</b>

20:07.380 --> 20:09.630
<b>So you even know that?</b>

20:09.630 --> 20:13.730
<b>I should've figured. Still, I won't reveal my secrets.</b>

20:13.730 --> 20:18.630
<b>Don't tell me you actually plan on fighting me?</b>

20:18.630 --> 20:24.450
<b>Bingo! And now I'll have to kill you too.</b>

20:24.450 --> 20:28.090
<b>Don't blame me, orders are orders.</b>

20:29.130 --> 20:31.100
<b>Well, let's get this over with!</b>

20:41.250 --> 20:42.190
<b>What?!</b>

20:49.540 --> 20:51.370
<b>Where did those letters come from?!</b>

20:52.640 --> 20:55.040
<b>I'm a bit disappointed!</b>

20:55.040 --> 20:57.450
<b>I thought you'd be a lot better than this!</b>

21:14.350 --> 21:15.650
<b>It's over!</b>

21:23.500 --> 21:26.740
<b>Oh? Blown to bits, huh?</b>

21:26.740 --> 21:29.010
<b>I wanted to see his corpse's face.</b>

21:34.060 --> 21:36.390
<b>Guess I'll have to follow him.</b>

21:48.410 --> 21:51.030
<b>What's that building?</b>

22:03.280 --> 22:04.650
<b>Oh, Gamma-<i>san</i>!</b>

22:04.650 --> 22:05.520
<b>Yo!</b>

22:08.620 --> 22:09.600
<b>Looks like you've been working hard!</b>

22:09.600 --> 22:10.930
<b>Welcome back!</b>

22:17.240 --> 22:18.570
<b>He disappeared?!</b>

22:44.760 --> 22:46.500
<b>Over there?</b>

22:54.850 --> 22:56.550
<b>Oh Gamma-<i>san</i>, welcome back!</b>

22:56.550 --> 22:59.020
<b>Glad to be back!</b>

22:59.360 --> 23:00.430
<b>Gamma?</b>

23:23.640 --> 23:26.010
<b>Great job, Gamma #2!</b>

23:26.010 --> 23:28.410
<b>I watched it all through your eyes.</b>

23:28.410 --> 23:30.280
<b>Thank you very much, Dr. Hedo!</b>

23:30.290 --> 23:33.400
<b>Still, I might've gone overboard for a mere test.</b>

23:35.130 --> 23:37.100
<b>What? Another one?</b>

23:37.100 --> 23:37.670
<b>Hm?</b>

23:37.670 --> 23:38.570
<b>Oh, it's nothing!</b>

23:38.570 --> 23:40.700
<b>No, you made the right decision.</b>

23:40.710 --> 23:46.120
<b>Still, you probably could've struck a pose during your intro and big finish.</b>

23:46.120 --> 23:49.090
<b>I can't believe the enemy realized his true identity.</b>

23:49.090 --> 23:53.400
<b>Hey, you're the one who wanted them to have the Red Ribbon mark.</b>

23:53.400 --> 23:54.870
<b>Did you locate his corpse?</b>

23:54.870 --> 23:55.870
<b>Corpse?</b>

23:55.870 --> 23:58.970
<b>No, he was blown to bits, so there was no need.</b>

23:58.970 --> 24:00.910
<b>You're too lax.</b>

24:00.920 --> 24:04.690
<b>There's no way he could've survived that. You were watching, right?</b>

24:05.760 --> 24:07.960
<b>Look here.</b>

24:07.960 --> 24:09.060
<b>It's so faint.</b>

24:09.060 --> 24:13.210
<b>If that is Piccolo, then it's possible the enemy organization has learned of our existence.</b>

24:13.210 --> 24:17.910
<b>Don't worry! Even if they have, there's no way they could ever find our secret base!</b>

24:17.910 --> 24:24.230
<b>And if they did, we could just beat their entire organization in one go! You're too strict, #1!</b>

24:24.230 --> 24:25.500
<b>Organization?</b>

24:26.200 --> 24:28.270
<b>Well you're too easy-going!</b>

24:29.070 --> 24:31.270
<b>"Carmine Presents"</b>

24:31.280 --> 24:39.150
<b>While they appear to be merely the enemy's mid-level bosses, these Son Goku and Vegeta fellows seem like quite formidable foes.</b>

24:39.150 --> 24:45.170
<b>And they also have the fearsome Majin Buu. What's more, we still haven't seen the true power of that miserable Mister Satan.</b>

24:45.170 --> 24:51.380
<b>Don't sweat it. We've now proven through live combat just how incredible my masterpieces the Gammas are.</b>

24:51.390 --> 24:52.350
<b>Not enough flair.</b>

24:52.350 --> 24:54.020
<b>Darn it. How 'bout this?</b>

24:54.020 --> 24:57.390
<b>Demon King Piccolo was a pushover, right Gamma?</b>

24:57.390 --> 25:00.000
<b>Sure was! A big disappointment.</b>

25:00.330 --> 25:04.110
<b>I'd expect no less from the grandson of the ingenious Dr. Gero.</b>

25:05.140 --> 25:08.350
<b>I'm more like a super genius!</b>

25:09.180 --> 25:12.660
<b>Well, 'super genius', if you've let Piccolo get away</b>

25:12.660 --> 25:14.730
<b>we'll have to rush our plans forward.</b>

25:14.730 --> 25:16.470
<b>Don't worry!</b>

25:16.470 --> 25:18.830
<b>Now that I've proven the Gammas' power</b>

25:18.830 --> 25:24.650
<b>I can use their data to make as many copies of them as we need in no time flat.</b>

25:24.650 --> 25:29.590
<b>Once we get rid of Bulma and the power of her evil secret society</b>

25:29.590 --> 25:34.840
<b>then the armies and police who serve as their minions will offer no resistance.</b>

25:34.840 --> 25:38.440
<b>We'll be able to take control of this rotten world in a flash!</b>

25:38.440 --> 25:44.120
<b>More importantly, Dr. Hedo: when will Cell Max be complete?</b>

25:44.120 --> 25:45.990
<b>Cell Max?!</b>

25:45.990 --> 25:49.760
<b>Don't worry, with the Gammas here, there's no need for Cell Max.</b>

25:49.760 --> 25:51.900
<b>I asked you: when?</b>

25:51.910 --> 25:56.610
<b>Geez, this guy… Alright. He'll probably take a bit longer.</b>

25:56.610 --> 25:59.410
<b>I thought you said he was nearly complete?</b>

25:59.410 --> 26:05.930
<b>Cell Max himself is already finished, but it will take more time to complete his mind control program.</b>

26:08.500 --> 26:10.740
<b>How long do you expect me to wait?!</b>

26:10.740 --> 26:13.180
<b>If you'll pardon me for saying so Commander Magenta</b>

26:13.180 --> 26:19.290
<b>you were the one who told me to create 'unimaginable power', even if it takes a while.</b>

26:19.290 --> 26:22.840
<b>It seems like you don't much care for Cell Max.</b>

26:22.840 --> 26:25.640
<b>Well, he certainly doesn't look like a superhero.</b>

26:25.640 --> 26:30.340
<b>And besides, I don't like how he's based off Dr. Gero's data.</b>

26:30.340 --> 26:35.620
<b>Cell's strength is well-established. I'm sure you saw the news reports at the time.</b>

26:35.620 --> 26:40.630
<b>However, his data was too complex for us to recreate him on our own.</b>

26:40.630 --> 26:45.140
<b>I figured that you would be able to bring him back even stronger than before.</b>

26:45.140 --> 26:50.020
<b>Of course, there's nothing to it. I just think it's a waste of time.</b>

26:50.020 --> 26:53.660
<b>If you didn't focus so much on the Gammas rather than on Cell Max</b>

26:53.660 --> 26:55.830
<b>surely he would be finished by now?</b>

26:55.830 --> 27:00.340
<b>An android like Cell is grown by gradually creating special cells</b>

27:00.340 --> 27:03.020
<b>so obviously this requires a long wait.</b>

27:03.020 --> 27:08.190
<b>If anything, you should thank me for effectively using this wait time to develop the Gammas.</b>

27:08.190 --> 27:13.300
<b>Enough already! I don't care, just activate Cell Max!</b>

27:14.940 --> 27:18.110
<b>Don't rush it, Commander Magenta.</b>

27:18.110 --> 27:21.910
<b>He's a far greater monster than the original Cell ever was.</b>

27:21.920 --> 27:25.520
<b>B-But he'd be the perfect means of showing off the power of the Red Ribbon!</b>

27:25.520 --> 27:31.060
<b>Still, if we unleashed him on the world in his current state, it would be a disaster!</b>

27:31.060 --> 27:31.770
<b>Why's that?</b>

27:31.770 --> 27:37.610
<b>He'd be uncontrollable. Do you really want to destroy the world you were planning to rule?</b>

27:39.450 --> 27:44.530
<b>Even without Cell Max, the Gammas will take care of any dangerous foes.</b>

27:44.530 --> 27:49.900
<b>You can just wait until later to activate Cell Max and show off your power to the world.</b>

27:49.900 --> 27:54.320
<b>I hope I can trust you.</b>

27:54.320 --> 27:55.820
<b>Of course you can.</b>

27:55.820 --> 27:58.290
<b>T-This is bad…</b>

28:03.840 --> 28:08.110
<b>Who is it? Oh wow, I never expected a call from you.</b>

28:08.110 --> 28:09.940
<b>Bulma, is Vegeta there?</b>

28:09.940 --> 28:13.160
<b>No, as usual he's off on Lord Beerus' planet.</b>

28:13.160 --> 28:15.560
<b>It's probably been three weeks since I last saw him.</b>

28:15.560 --> 28:16.490
<b>Is Goku there too?</b>

28:16.490 --> 28:18.130
<b>Of course.</b>

28:18.130 --> 28:21.430
<b>You had a device for contacting Whis, right?</b>

28:21.430 --> 28:23.840
<b>Tell them to come back at once.</b>

28:23.840 --> 28:26.340
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

28:26.340 --> 28:30.350
<b>Yeah, I can't explain now, but it looks like something awful might happen.</b>

28:30.350 --> 28:33.700
<b>OK, got it. I'll try to get ahold of them.</b>

28:34.430 --> 28:37.900
<b>I'll have to manage on my own for now.</b>

28:37.900 --> 28:40.470
<b>Oh yeah! There might be some Senzu.</b>

28:58.070 --> 28:59.710
<b>Wait wait wait!</b>

29:04.420 --> 29:08.160
<b>You were gonna go berserk again!</b>

29:08.160 --> 29:11.600
<b>How many times I gotta tell ya to hold it in?</b>

29:11.600 --> 29:14.040
<b>I'm sorry… I didn't mean to…</b>

29:18.210 --> 29:25.000
<b>Hey, cut it out! If you sit still so long, you're gonna get rusty!</b>

29:25.000 --> 29:31.300
<b>The world is full of guys like Jiren, and Broly here</b>

29:31.300 --> 29:35.350
<b>and loads of other amazin' folks!</b>

29:35.350 --> 29:39.220
<b>Shut up and don't interfere. This is training too.</b>

29:39.220 --> 29:43.800
<b>You fibber! No way is that a form of trainin'!</b>

29:43.800 --> 29:46.470
<b>You just don't get it.</b>

29:46.470 --> 29:48.010
<b>What's to get?</b>

29:48.010 --> 29:55.660
<b>Jiren was so overwhelmingly strong. And yet, his power really wasn't so different from our own.</b>

29:55.660 --> 29:56.930
<b>Huh?</b>

29:56.930 --> 30:00.860
<b>But he used his power with total efficiency. Didn't you notice?</b>

30:00.860 --> 30:07.350
<b>Even in the midst of battle, his body and spirit were both fully relaxed until the moment he struck.</b>

30:07.350 --> 30:08.180
<b>Really?</b>

30:08.180 --> 30:13.590
<b>Such an attack from nowhere can't be predicted by the enemy, and packs a tremendous punch.</b>

30:13.600 --> 30:16.360
<b>What's more, it allows one to conserve stamina.</b>

30:16.360 --> 30:18.100
<b>Maybe so...</b>

30:18.100 --> 30:20.940
<b>Jiren probably achieved it by instinct.</b>

30:20.940 --> 30:25.120
<b>So since I can't manage it myself, I'm starting out with mental training.</b>

30:25.120 --> 30:28.250
<b>Ding ding ding! Outstanding!</b>

30:28.250 --> 30:33.660
<b>Truly outstanding, Vegeta-<i>san</i>! I'm impressed you've realized that.</b>

30:33.670 --> 30:40.640
<b>You're absolutely correct! It's not training to simply beef up your body like an idiot!</b>

30:40.640 --> 30:42.010
<b>Yeah...</b>

30:42.780 --> 30:46.220
<b>Although it did take you quite a while to catch on.</b>

30:46.220 --> 30:49.830
<b>It seems this still hasn't fully clicked for Goku.</b>

30:49.830 --> 30:54.280
<b>I know! Why don't the three of you test it out in a sparring match?</b>

30:54.280 --> 30:57.210
<b>Broly too?! You've got to be kidding!</b>

30:57.210 --> 31:02.420
<b>He's a bit better than he used to be, but he still goes wild at times.</b>

31:02.420 --> 31:06.400
<b>If he really cuts loose, this tiny planet will be toast!</b>

31:06.400 --> 31:08.200
<b>I suppose that's true.</b>

31:08.200 --> 31:17.820
<b>In that case, Goku-<i>san</i> and Vegeta-<i>san</i> can show Broly-<i>san</i> what a properly restrained sparring match looks like.</b>

31:17.820 --> 31:18.790
<b>Got it.</b>

31:20.220 --> 31:21.250
<b>Whis!</b>

31:22.290 --> 31:24.840
<b>How long have I been napping?</b>

31:24.840 --> 31:27.440
<b>Good morning. Let's see…</b>

31:27.440 --> 31:30.640
<b>In terms of Earth time, I suppose it's been four months.</b>

31:30.640 --> 31:36.990
<b>What? Man, I woke up earlier than I thought. It's so noisy! And I smell something tasty!</b>

31:38.160 --> 31:39.630
<b>Who is that?</b>

31:39.630 --> 31:41.700
<b>This is Broly.</b>

31:41.700 --> 31:44.680
<b>Broly?! What's he doing here?!</b>

31:44.680 --> 31:47.780
<b>There's no way Freeza could find him here, right?</b>

31:47.780 --> 31:49.680
<b>So we brought him along to be safe.</b>

31:49.680 --> 31:52.180
<b>Don't just bring anyone you want over here!</b>

31:52.180 --> 31:54.530
<b>This isn't a hotel!</b>

31:57.330 --> 31:59.770
<b>There you are. Say hello.</b>

31:59.770 --> 32:03.000
<b>Uh… Um… Sorry to intrude.</b>

32:04.020 --> 32:06.320
<b>You too, huh? And who are you, exactly?!</b>

32:06.320 --> 32:09.950
<b>M-My name is Lemo. I'm a former member of Freeza's army…</b>

32:11.590 --> 32:15.340
<b>So that's what smelled so good. Bring it over.</b>

32:15.340 --> 32:17.170
<b>Y-Yes sir…</b>

32:24.220 --> 32:27.430
<b>Hey, not bad! What did you do back when you were in Freeza's army?</b>

32:27.430 --> 32:30.400
<b>I did odd jobs, and occasionally cooking.</b>

32:30.400 --> 32:32.800
<b>OK, you can stay.</b>

32:32.800 --> 32:35.440
<b>Man, it's so far…</b>

32:35.440 --> 32:37.110
<b>Hey, looks like you're doing well!</b>

32:37.110 --> 32:37.910
<b>Yeah!</b>

32:37.910 --> 32:38.910
<b>Yo!</b>

32:38.910 --> 32:40.520
<b>You guys are here too, huh?</b>

32:40.520 --> 32:43.920
<b>This place hardly has anything valuable. What a letdown!</b>

32:43.930 --> 32:46.330
<b>C-Cheelai! Zip it!</b>

32:52.500 --> 32:55.080
<b>U-Um… I-I'll go do some cleaning…</b>

32:55.080 --> 32:56.880
<b>And who is this now?</b>

32:56.880 --> 32:59.790
<b>M-My name is Cheelai! Um… Are you…</b>

32:59.790 --> 33:04.590
<b>I mean, would you sir happen to be Lord Beerus, the God of Destruction?</b>

33:04.600 --> 33:05.840
<b>That's right.</b>

33:05.840 --> 33:10.170
<b>T-The one they say is the most fearsome in the entire universe?...</b>

33:23.870 --> 33:25.440
<b>You sure are cute…</b>

33:25.440 --> 33:26.380
<b>Huh?!</b>

33:26.380 --> 33:28.410
<b>You can stay here as long as you like!</b>

33:30.280 --> 33:32.550
<b>Wha… What the…?</b>

33:32.550 --> 33:37.030
<b>I never expected Lord Beerus' tastes to be so… traditional.</b>

33:37.030 --> 33:41.240
<b>Alright then! Never mind all that, you two begin your match!</b>

33:41.240 --> 33:43.600
<b>The last man standing is the winner.</b>

33:43.600 --> 33:49.090
<b>Transformations and projectiles like the Kamehameha are forbidden. Is that alright?</b>

33:50.460 --> 33:54.470
<b>Let's eat first. I'm starvin'!</b>

33:55.640 --> 33:58.370
<b>Well, that's a Saiyan for you.</b>

33:58.870 --> 34:00.710
<b>Huh?</b>

34:00.710 --> 34:04.650
<b>Where's my communicator? My communicator! Ow!</b>

34:04.660 --> 34:07.090
<b>Where the heck did I put it?</b>

34:08.690 --> 34:13.200
<b>There's no more left of the delicious Earth food that Vegeta-<i>san</i> brought us</b>

34:13.200 --> 34:17.350
<b>so I've had Lemo prepare us a meal.</b>

34:17.350 --> 34:19.680
<b>Hopefully it tastes alright.</b>

34:21.320 --> 34:26.630
<b>Marvelous! How did you make this? It's just like magic, Lemo-<i>san</i>!</b>

34:26.630 --> 34:29.230
<b>I put in some spices…</b>

34:29.230 --> 34:31.540
<b>Hey, what's different about it?</b>

34:31.540 --> 34:33.040
<b>No clue.</b>

34:34.210 --> 34:38.890
<b>I like it! Lemo-<i>san</i>, you can be in charge of cooking from now on! Whis, you're fired!</b>

34:38.890 --> 34:41.960
<b>Oh dear, I'm so sad!</b>

34:58.590 --> 35:00.560
<b>Begin!</b>

36:16.150 --> 36:17.320
<b>I'm not done yet!</b>

36:29.370 --> 36:32.180
<b>Don't get carried away, Kakarot!</b>

36:38.690 --> 36:40.130
<b>Don't underestimate me!</b>

36:53.150 --> 36:57.770
<b>Vegeta's movements are slightly different from before.</b>

36:59.570 --> 37:02.070
<b>I suppose it's the result of his training.</b>

37:02.070 --> 37:04.970
<b>This looks like it'll take a while.</b>

37:04.970 --> 37:07.790
<b>How about some dessert?</b>

37:07.790 --> 37:08.920
<b>Such as?</b>

37:08.920 --> 37:13.260
<b>We still have plenty of the ice cream that Vegeta-<i>san</i> brought.</b>

37:13.260 --> 37:16.390
<b>In that case, I'll go get it!</b>

37:16.400 --> 37:18.740
<b>Then I'll help you.</b>

37:18.740 --> 37:19.810
<b>Oh?</b>

37:22.580 --> 37:27.530
<b>Ice cream… ice cream… ah, here it is. Hey, Lemo!</b>

37:27.530 --> 37:28.790
<b>Y… Yes sir?</b>

37:28.790 --> 37:32.630
<b>You can do the dishes later. Come eat ice cream with us.</b>

37:32.630 --> 37:34.730
<b>…Much obliged.</b>

37:34.730 --> 37:40.080
<b>Aha! Here it is!</b>

37:44.120 --> 37:47.030
<b>Broly! Eat with us!</b>

38:12.340 --> 38:17.420
<b>You're so kind, Lord Beerus. I wonder who you did that for…</b>

38:17.420 --> 38:19.230
<b>Shut up and eat!</b>

38:28.410 --> 38:31.020
<b>Whis-<i>san</i>! Whis-<i>san</i>!</b>

38:32.020 --> 38:37.700
<b>Come on! Why won't you pick up?!</b>

38:37.970 --> 38:42.240
<b>I see, I had no idea that was going on.</b>

38:42.240 --> 38:44.640
<b>Oh… I'm so sorry.</b>

38:44.640 --> 38:46.110
<b>I only have these two beans at the moment.</b>

38:46.110 --> 38:49.690
<b>Two, huh? Fine. Thank you.</b>

38:49.690 --> 38:52.390
<b>Lord God, please be careful.</b>

38:52.390 --> 38:53.960
<b>I'm no longer a god.</b>

38:53.960 --> 38:55.960
<b>Oh… right.</b>

38:58.670 --> 39:02.240
<b>Bulma! Well, did you get a hold of them?</b>

39:02.240 --> 39:06.080
<b>Well, no. They won't pick up at all!</b>

39:06.080 --> 39:08.290
<b>But I'll keep on trying a bit longer.</b>

39:08.290 --> 39:10.830
<b>I see. Thank you, please do.</b>

39:10.830 --> 39:13.000
<b>She can't get in touch with them?</b>

39:13.000 --> 39:16.370
<b>Guess not. It will be tough doing this without Goku or Vegeta.</b>

39:16.380 --> 39:23.680
<b>Judging by my battle, those Gamma androids seem on par with them.</b>

39:23.680 --> 39:26.190
<b>That's certainly bad news…</b>

39:26.190 --> 39:28.000
<b>What about Son Gohan?</b>

39:28.000 --> 39:35.210
<b>Didn't you once say he could be stronger than anyone else on Earth if he put his mind to it?</b>

39:35.210 --> 39:38.020
<b>The way he is now, I can't rely on him.</b>

39:38.020 --> 39:39.920
<b>I see…</b>

39:39.920 --> 39:45.430
<b>Dr. Hedo might have data on #17 and #18's weaknesses.</b>

39:45.430 --> 39:49.140
<b>And Majin Buu is currently hibernating.</b>

39:49.140 --> 39:51.140
<b>Which means…</b>

39:51.140 --> 39:55.550
<b>I can't believe it… I'll have to handle this by myself.</b>

39:55.550 --> 39:57.120
<b>I know!</b>

40:00.360 --> 40:01.600
<b>Piccolo-<i>san</i>!</b>

40:01.600 --> 40:02.700
<b>Dende!</b>

40:03.400 --> 40:04.970
<b>Do you understand the situation?</b>

40:04.970 --> 40:07.570
<b>Yes! I've been watching from up above!</b>

40:07.580 --> 40:11.450
<b>Things are looking grim. Is there anything I can do?</b>

40:11.450 --> 40:13.220
<b>I've heard that back on Planet Namek</b>

40:13.220 --> 40:18.770
<b>Kuririn and Gohan had their potential drawn out by the Great Elder.</b>

40:18.770 --> 40:21.030
<b>Yes, I saw it.</b>

40:21.700 --> 40:23.470
<b>Do the same to me.</b>

40:23.470 --> 40:24.940
<b>Who, me?</b>

40:24.940 --> 40:26.310
<b>That's right.</b>

40:26.310 --> 40:30.150
<b>You're the same type of Namekian as the Great Elder.</b>

40:30.150 --> 40:31.520
<b>You should be able to.</b>

40:31.520 --> 40:36.990
<b>Unfortunately, one can only use that ability after a certain age.</b>

40:37.000 --> 40:38.770
<b>W-What?</b>

40:38.770 --> 40:42.410
<b>I know! Why don't we use the dragon balls?</b>

40:42.410 --> 40:44.010
<b>The dragon balls?</b>

40:44.010 --> 40:46.610
<b>We could wish for the Red Ribbon Army to be wiped out!</b>

40:47.820 --> 40:51.030
<b>But I can see your pride would never allow that.</b>

40:51.030 --> 40:56.830
<b>In that case, why don't we have Shenlong draw out your potential just like the Great Elder?</b>

40:56.830 --> 40:59.510
<b>Could Shenlong do that?</b>

40:59.510 --> 41:01.580
<b>Probably, if I upgrade him.</b>

41:01.580 --> 41:02.950
<b>Upgrade?</b>

41:02.950 --> 41:07.290
<b>Yeah, remember how the number of wishes granted was raised from one to three?</b>

41:07.300 --> 41:11.000
<b>Just like that. Please wait here.</b>

41:39.290 --> 41:42.930
<b>Alright, Shenlong should be upgraded now.</b>

41:42.930 --> 41:45.670
<b>Even as a former god, I didn't know this was possible.</b>

41:45.670 --> 41:48.910
<b>It's because you came to Earth so long ago.</b>

41:48.910 --> 41:52.450
<b>Still, we'll need time to gather the dragon balls.</b>

41:52.450 --> 41:56.920
<b>I think Bulma should have all seven right now.</b>

41:56.920 --> 42:00.430
<b>For the last few years, Bulma and her staff have gathered the balls</b>

42:00.430 --> 42:07.070
<b>and made insignificant wishes in order to keep them from being used for evil.</b>

42:07.070 --> 42:09.990
<b>Surely she doesn't need to actually make wishes just for that?</b>

42:09.990 --> 42:14.590
<b>But remember how they were stolen by Freeza's army not too long ago?</b>

42:14.590 --> 42:17.990
<b>After granting a wish, the dragon balls scattered again.</b>

42:18.000 --> 42:21.310
<b>I see. Well, it's lucky for us at any rate.</b>

42:23.110 --> 42:24.240
<b>Bulma!</b>

42:24.240 --> 42:26.610
<b>Yes, yes, I hear you.</b>

42:26.610 --> 42:27.810
<b>Have you managed to contact them yet?</b>

42:27.820 --> 42:30.060
<b>Not yet I'm afraid.</b>

42:30.060 --> 42:33.360
<b>Bulma, do you have the dragon balls by any chance?</b>

42:33.360 --> 42:37.070
<b>The dragon balls? Why yes, I have all seven.</b>

42:37.070 --> 42:41.620
<b>Alright! Sorry, I know you worked hard to collect them, but could you let me use them instead?</b>

42:41.620 --> 42:42.850
<b>Huh?!</b>

42:42.850 --> 42:46.950
<b>Please! After all, you were just going to use them for something insignificant anyway, right?</b>

42:46.950 --> 42:49.600
<b>There's nothing insignificant about it!</b>

42:49.600 --> 42:53.040
<b>…Oh well, if it's for your sake Piccolo, then I guess it's OK.</b>

42:53.040 --> 42:55.040
<b>Thanks, I'll be there right away!</b>

42:55.040 --> 42:57.040
<b>Wait for me out in the garden.</b>

43:01.150 --> 43:06.330
<b>Come forth Shenlong, and grant my wish!</b>

43:24.500 --> 43:31.510
<b>Speak your wish! I shall grant yo— Oh! Lord Piccolo?!</b>

43:31.510 --> 43:40.000
<b>Shenlong! Can you fully draw out my potential, just as the late Great Elder of Namek could?</b>

43:40.000 --> 43:44.340
<b>Yes, of course. Is that your first wish?</b>

43:44.340 --> 43:46.610
<b>That's right. Please do that.</b>

44:02.410 --> 44:06.080
<b>Th-This feeling… M-My power… has risen this much?!</b>

44:06.080 --> 44:08.860
<b>I've included a small bonus as well.</b>

44:13.930 --> 44:17.230
<b>Now then, please state your other two wishes.</b>

44:17.230 --> 44:18.540
<b>I've got all I want.</b>

44:18.550 --> 44:20.950
<b>What, really?! That's all?!</b>

44:20.950 --> 44:23.950
<b>Then, may I use the other two wishes?</b>

44:23.950 --> 44:26.290
<b>Of course. Feel free.</b>

44:26.290 --> 44:32.500
<b>In that case… How about I make my butt a little tighter? Just like a young babe.</b>

44:32.500 --> 44:33.470
<b>Huh?</b>

44:33.470 --> 44:38.340
<b>A simple wish. There, it is granted.</b>

44:38.340 --> 44:43.690
<b>Then for the third… Maybe I should have him remove my crow's feet again.</b>

44:43.690 --> 44:44.860
<b>H-Hang on a second.</b>

44:44.860 --> 44:46.090
<b>What's the matter?</b>

44:46.090 --> 44:49.260
<b>Isn't there… anything else you'd rather wish for…?</b>

44:49.270 --> 44:51.470
<b>What's wrong with that?!</b>

44:51.470 --> 44:55.480
<b>Fine, how about I make my eyelashes 2mm longer?</b>

44:56.110 --> 44:57.880
<b>It is granted.</b>

44:57.880 --> 45:01.560
<b>Well then, Lord Piccolo, I bid you farewell.</b>

45:10.680 --> 45:13.820
<b>Are your wishes always like that?</b>

45:13.820 --> 45:14.880
<b>Is that so wrong?</b>

45:14.880 --> 45:17.090
<b>N-No. Do what you want.</b>

45:17.090 --> 45:20.270
<b>Oh no!</b>

45:20.270 --> 45:21.400
<b>W-What?</b>

45:21.400 --> 45:25.610
<b>We should've just wished for him to bring Goku and Vegeta here!</b>

45:25.610 --> 45:29.340
<b>Ah! Thanks to your stupid butt lift—</b>

45:29.350 --> 45:32.920
<b>What?! You didn't think of it either!</b>

45:32.920 --> 45:36.290
<b>…I'll go infiltrate their HQ again.</b>

45:38.560 --> 45:43.240
<b>How about picking Son Goku or Vegeta for the next target?</b>

45:43.240 --> 45:48.520
<b>We should eliminate all boss-class enemies before they have a chance to formulate a counterattack.</b>

45:48.520 --> 45:53.100
<b>Our spies say they are unable to locate them at the moment.</b>

45:48.520 --> 45:49.850
<b>—Where'd you go?</b>

45:49.860 --> 45:53.060
<b>—I had a stomachache and went to the toilet.</b>

45:53.060 --> 45:56.100
<b>—Are you OK? You look a little green.</b>

45:53.100 --> 45:55.900
<b>In that case, what about the traitors #17 and #18</b>

45:55.900 --> 45:59.680
<b>or that wretched Mister Satan?</b>

45:56.100 --> 45:58.600
<b>—I-I'm fine.</b>

45:58.600 --> 46:00.850
<b>—If you can't hold it in, tell me right away.</b>

46:00.850 --> 46:01.550
<b>—Right.</b>

46:01.550 --> 46:05.490
<b>Then how about Son Goku's son, Son Gohan?</b>

46:05.490 --> 46:07.920
<b>While he now poses as a biologist</b>

46:07.920 --> 46:15.000
<b>according to our spy cameras he is really a terrifying being who defeated Cell while still a child.</b>

46:15.000 --> 46:19.340
<b>And judging by the way in which Piccolo frequently visited his hideout</b>

46:19.350 --> 46:21.690
<b>it's even possible that Gohan is their secret boss.</b>

46:21.690 --> 46:26.190
<b>He could prove dangerous if we don't eliminate him now.</b>

46:26.190 --> 46:33.140
<b>Alright. But I don't want the world at large to learn of our army's existence until Cell Max is complete</b>

46:33.140 --> 46:35.580
<b>so we must avoid causing an uproar in the city.</b>

46:35.580 --> 46:39.780
<b>It might prove difficult. He hardly ever leaves his lair.</b>

46:39.790 --> 46:43.360
<b>Hm. Perhaps we should have him fight here?</b>

46:43.360 --> 46:44.330
<b>Here?</b>

46:44.330 --> 46:48.570
<b>Son Gohan's supposed to have a daughter who attends kindergarten.</b>

46:48.570 --> 46:52.850
<b>We can kidnap her to lure Gohan here alone.</b>

46:52.850 --> 46:56.990
<b>It also might be fun to watch the Gammas fight in person.</b>

46:56.990 --> 47:01.530
<b>I see, that could also raise our troop morale.</b>

47:01.530 --> 47:06.370
<b>Even if they're our enemies, I can't endorse kidnapping a child.</b>

47:08.540 --> 47:11.920
<b>Nobody asked your opinion, scientist. Hey!</b>

47:12.720 --> 47:13.660
<b>Sir, yes sir!</b>

47:13.660 --> 47:17.390
<b>Send two men out to kidnap Son Gohan's daughter and bring her back here.</b>

47:17.390 --> 47:18.960
<b>Roger!</b>

47:18.960 --> 47:20.530
<b>#15, can you go?</b>

47:20.540 --> 47:21.840
<b>Leave it to me.</b>

47:21.840 --> 47:24.010
<b>In that case, please let me go too!</b>

47:24.010 --> 47:27.250
<b>Who do you think you are?! Don't talk out of turn!</b>

47:27.250 --> 47:34.000
<b>I-I happen to live near Son Gohan's house, and I've seen his daughter before.</b>

47:34.000 --> 47:36.570
<b>You've seen her before? How odd.</b>

47:36.570 --> 47:39.040
<b>Why do you know Son Gohan's daughter?</b>

47:39.040 --> 47:41.650
<b>Huh? Well, uh, see…</b>

47:41.650 --> 47:45.920
<b>T-That girl is also the granddaughter of the famous Mister Satan!</b>

47:45.920 --> 47:50.090
<b>I see now. Still, I'm the one who selects men for the job.</b>

47:50.100 --> 47:54.740
<b>#94, you're still a rookie. Keep quiet and stand on guard.</b>

47:54.740 --> 47:57.870
<b>No, if he already knows that girl, that'll be convenient.</b>

47:57.870 --> 47:59.480
<b>Let him go.</b>

47:59.480 --> 48:01.090
<b>Yes sir, understood.</b>

48:03.360 --> 48:09.230
<b><i>I see… This might be the perfect opportunity to help Gohan awaken!</i></b>

48:09.230 --> 48:12.540
<b>You sure are quiet. Nervous?</b>

48:12.540 --> 48:15.550
<b>Y-Yes. Um… how are we going to kidnap her?</b>

48:15.550 --> 48:18.150
<b>Kindergarten should be ending soon.</b>

48:18.150 --> 48:21.460
<b>Most likely her mother or someone will be coming to pick her up.</b>

48:21.460 --> 48:26.930
<b>While they're on the move, we can seize the chance to kidnap both mother and daughter.</b>

48:28.470 --> 48:30.570
<b>#79 told me about you.</b>

48:30.580 --> 48:31.210
<b>Hm?</b>

48:31.210 --> 48:34.650
<b>We'll be landing soon, so don't shit your pants.</b>

48:34.650 --> 48:36.420
<b>I'll… try not to.</b>

48:39.690 --> 48:42.270
<b>Bye-bye!</b>

48:42.270 --> 48:44.140
<b>Sorry for being late.</b>

48:44.140 --> 48:45.710
<b>No biggie!</b>

48:45.710 --> 48:47.270
<b>Is that the girl?</b>

48:47.270 --> 48:48.540
<b>Yes.</b>

48:48.540 --> 48:50.380
<b>Looks like all the other kids are gone.</b>

48:50.390 --> 48:53.820
<b>OK, her mom's not here yet, but let's kidnap her right away.</b>

48:53.820 --> 48:54.820
<b>What?</b>

48:54.820 --> 48:56.860
<b>It's just one little brat. This'll be a cinch.</b>

48:56.860 --> 48:59.700
<b>Do you think your mother will be here soon?</b>

48:59.700 --> 49:03.040
<b>Pan-<i>chan</i>, sorry I'm late!</b>

49:03.040 --> 49:06.210
<b>Your mom asked me to come pick you up for her.</b>

49:06.210 --> 49:10.430
<b>Well, shall we head home? Tell your teacher goodbye.</b>

49:11.290 --> 49:12.530
<b>Uh-oh!</b>

49:12.530 --> 49:15.530
<b>Oh! What's the matter!</b>

49:15.530 --> 49:17.630
<b>I don't know this man!</b>

49:18.730 --> 49:20.270
<b>Huh? Piccolo-<i>san</i>?</b>

49:20.270 --> 49:21.780
<b>Oh, I'm impressed you knew it was me!</b>

49:21.780 --> 49:25.480
<b>It's easy. I can tell from your <i>ki</i>.</b>

49:25.480 --> 49:26.590
<b>I should've guessed.</b>

49:26.590 --> 49:30.320
<b>Then is that man a friend of yours, Piccolo-<i>san</i>?</b>

49:30.320 --> 49:33.600
<b>Sorry for startling you. This was part of her training.</b>

49:33.600 --> 49:34.500
<b>Oh!</b>

49:34.500 --> 49:37.540
<b>She's the granddaughter of the wealthy Mister Satan, after all.</b>

49:37.540 --> 49:40.720
<b>Oh, I see! Thank goodness!</b>

49:41.890 --> 49:44.690
<b>You can't park here!</b>

49:44.690 --> 49:46.430
<b>Yeah, guess we'd better get out of here quick.</b>

49:46.430 --> 49:48.330
<b>Whose plane is this?</b>

49:48.330 --> 49:51.160
<b>It belongs to some bad people called the Red Ribbon Army.</b>

49:51.170 --> 49:52.380
<b>Pan, you can ride in back.</b>

49:54.280 --> 49:55.380
<b>What's going on?</b>

49:55.380 --> 49:56.650
<b>I'll tell you once we take off.</b>

49:56.650 --> 49:58.450
<b>For now, just put on these handcuffs.</b>

49:58.450 --> 50:00.750
<b>But you can get out of these at any time, right?</b>

50:00.760 --> 50:01.960
<b>Piece of cake!</b>

50:09.140 --> 50:11.310
<b>Teacher, bye-bye! Oh!</b>

50:13.450 --> 50:14.180
<b>My!</b>

50:17.620 --> 50:20.320
<b>Piccolo, you're a real bad pilot!</b>

50:20.320 --> 50:22.030
<b>This isn't my forte.</b>

50:22.030 --> 50:23.040
<b>So, what's up?</b>

50:23.040 --> 50:23.900
<b>Right.</b>

50:23.900 --> 50:30.380
<b>I followed a fearsome android in order to infiltrate an evil organization known as the Red Ribbon Army.</b>

50:30.380 --> 50:34.890
<b>I learned they're planning to eliminate us before we can stop them from taking over the world.</b>

50:34.890 --> 50:36.590
<b>Infiltrate?</b>

50:36.590 --> 50:39.800
<b>It means that I snuck in by pretending to be one of them, and checked things out.</b>

50:39.800 --> 50:42.210
<b>Oh, so that's why you're dressed like that!</b>

50:42.210 --> 50:49.080
<b>Exactly. Then I found out they were planning to kidnap you so they could lure your dad out and defeat him.</b>

50:49.080 --> 50:51.150
<b>Whoa! That sounds fun!</b>

50:51.160 --> 50:54.860
<b>Don't take them lightly, they mean business.</b>

50:54.860 --> 50:58.130
<b>Pretend that you've really been kidnapped and are scared.</b>

50:58.130 --> 51:00.970
<b>But don't worry, I'll protect you.</b>

51:02.620 --> 51:06.020
<b>But Papa seems real busy. Will he come?</b>

51:06.020 --> 51:07.390
<b>Of course he will!</b>

51:07.390 --> 51:10.890
<b>If this doesn't bring him out, I'll beat him half to death!</b>

51:14.240 --> 51:15.970
<b>Help!</b>

51:16.340 --> 51:18.270
<b>I'm scared!</b>

51:18.270 --> 51:19.680
<b>You awake?</b>

51:19.680 --> 51:21.710
<b>D-Did you get her?</b>

51:21.720 --> 51:22.590
<b>Yeah.</b>

51:22.590 --> 51:24.590
<b>Please don't tell anyone.</b>

51:24.590 --> 51:25.290
<b>What?</b>

51:25.290 --> 51:27.290
<b>Don't say how… I got beat up by a kid.</b>

51:27.290 --> 51:28.560
<b>Roger.</b>

51:33.580 --> 51:37.950
<b>No! Let me go! I'm scared!</b>

51:43.330 --> 51:46.230
<b>Papa, I'm scared! Save me!</b>

51:46.230 --> 51:47.300
<b>I've made the recording.</b>

51:47.300 --> 51:51.100
<b>Alright, show that to Son Gohan and bring him here.</b>

51:51.100 --> 51:52.140
<b>Roger.</b>

51:52.150 --> 51:57.850
<b>Hey hey hey. Those snacks aren't for you. Don't push your luck.</b>

51:58.620 --> 51:59.820
<b>Hey, #94.</b>

51:59.820 --> 52:00.390
<b>Yes sir?</b>

52:00.390 --> 52:03.470
<b>You can go this time too. You seem pretty familiar with the area.</b>

52:03.470 --> 52:05.200
<b>R-Roger!</b>

52:06.670 --> 52:08.410
<b>So, this is the place?</b>

52:10.280 --> 52:12.090
<b>That won't work. Come this way.</b>

52:15.620 --> 52:18.360
<b>Man, it's like you live here.</b>

52:19.760 --> 52:21.800
<b>Who are you people?</b>

52:21.810 --> 52:23.340
<b>Are you Son Gohan?</b>

52:23.340 --> 52:25.010
<b>That's right.</b>

52:25.010 --> 52:27.950
<b>What's with that crazy outfit?</b>

52:27.950 --> 52:29.050
<b>What, this?</b>

52:29.050 --> 52:34.430
<b>…Doesn't he realize it's me? Why not? Even Pan knew right away.</b>

52:34.430 --> 52:38.630
<b>Come with us if you want to live.</b>

52:38.630 --> 52:40.470
<b>I'm busy right now.</b>

52:40.470 --> 52:42.510
<b>Are you blind?!</b>

52:45.180 --> 52:48.220
<b>Please leave, or I'll call the police.</b>

52:48.220 --> 52:49.590
<b>Get a load of this!</b>

52:49.590 --> 52:51.120
<b>Papa, I'm scared! Save me!</b>

52:51.120 --> 52:51.790
<b>Pan!</b>

52:51.800 --> 52:55.370
<b>That's the situation. We've got your little girl.</b>

52:55.370 --> 53:00.080
<b>Come with us if you don't want anything… unfortunate to happen to her.</b>

53:01.840 --> 53:03.420
<b>Man oh man...</b>

53:15.580 --> 53:18.680
<b>What have you done with Pan?!</b>

53:18.680 --> 53:21.850
<b>D-D-Don't worry! She's still safe!</b>

53:21.850 --> 53:24.260
<b>U-Um… Won't you please come along with us… sir?</b>

53:24.260 --> 53:28.070
<b>Let's hurry! If anything happens to Pan, you'll pay the price!</b>

53:28.070 --> 53:29.870
<b>G-Got it!</b>

53:29.870 --> 53:31.900
<b>Alright, this is more like it!</b>

53:43.640 --> 53:45.600
<b>He'll be here any moment now!</b>

53:56.660 --> 53:58.360
<b>Over there?</b>

54:09.620 --> 54:11.520
<b>He's here! Papa's here!</b>

54:11.520 --> 54:12.660
<b>Pan!</b>

54:16.730 --> 54:17.470
<b>He's fast!</b>

54:17.470 --> 54:18.170
<b>#2!</b>

54:20.340 --> 54:21.640
<b>Papa!</b>

54:24.080 --> 54:24.950
<b>Alright!</b>

54:27.750 --> 54:29.660
<b>You scoundrel!</b>

54:30.720 --> 54:32.220
<b>#1!</b>

54:32.220 --> 54:34.400
<b>I'll take you on.</b>

54:36.000 --> 54:38.940
<b>If you want to save your daughter, then try and beat him.</b>

54:39.440 --> 54:41.840
<b>Who are you people?</b>

55:14.550 --> 55:15.680
<b>Y-You've got to be kidding me!</b>

55:19.890 --> 55:21.490
<b>I'm glad he came.</b>

55:21.490 --> 55:25.770
<b>Yeah. But that other guy is strong. Can Papa win?</b>

55:25.770 --> 55:26.640
<b>Not at this rate.</b>

55:26.640 --> 55:27.370
<b>Huh?</b>

55:27.370 --> 55:32.920
<b>We can only hope that Gohan awakens and fully regains his knack for battle.</b>

55:34.990 --> 55:37.690
<b>Who are you?</b>

55:38.630 --> 55:40.330
<b>A superhero.</b>

55:40.330 --> 55:41.530
<b>Huh?</b>

55:55.860 --> 55:59.370
<b>You're no robot. Could you be an android?</b>

55:59.370 --> 56:01.440
<b>Guess there's no fooling you.</b>

56:01.440 --> 56:05.920
<b>I see. But why have you done something so cowardly?</b>

56:05.920 --> 56:08.420
<b>The kidnapping wasn't my idea.</b>

56:08.420 --> 56:12.990
<b>I merely carry out my orders, for the sake of justice.</b>

56:12.990 --> 56:14.870
<b>Justice? Orders?</b>

56:14.870 --> 56:18.770
<b>My orders are to wipe out evil secret societies like you and your friends!</b>

56:18.770 --> 56:19.910
<b>What?</b>

56:35.540 --> 56:37.210
<b>W-What the?!</b>

56:37.210 --> 56:40.120
<b>It's no trick! So he's a real alien?!</b>

56:45.200 --> 56:47.470
<b>I've been expecting this transformation.</b>

57:14.390 --> 57:15.490
<b>Dang it!</b>

57:28.780 --> 57:31.420
<b>Alright Papa! Hang in there!</b>

57:31.420 --> 57:33.320
<b>Damn, this is bad.</b>

57:33.320 --> 57:33.830
<b>Huh?</b>

57:33.830 --> 57:37.730
<b>It looks like he studies his opponent's powers and movements as he fights.</b>

57:41.070 --> 57:43.670
<b>Is this all the power you've got?</b>

57:43.670 --> 57:44.820
<b>What?</b>

57:44.820 --> 57:46.990
<b>If so, then you haven't a prayer.</b>

57:46.990 --> 57:48.550
<b>What was that?!</b>

57:55.600 --> 57:58.110
<b>He's great! Fantastic!</b>

57:58.110 --> 58:00.340
<b>That's my Gamma for you!</b>

58:07.190 --> 58:08.990
<b>When I give the word, shout!</b>

58:12.000 --> 58:15.080
<b>Ow! That hurts!</b>

58:21.020 --> 58:21.650
<b>Pan!</b>

58:21.650 --> 58:23.650
<b>Stop! What are you doing?!</b>

58:23.650 --> 58:25.800
<b>Unhand that child!</b>

58:25.800 --> 58:26.700
<b>Huh?</b>

58:49.710 --> 58:50.580
<b>W-What the?!</b>

58:55.720 --> 58:58.030
<b>Great! He's finally awakened!</b>

58:58.030 --> 58:59.490
<b>Oh yeah!</b>

59:01.360 --> 59:03.300
<b>This can't be happening!</b>

59:06.640 --> 59:09.950
<b>An evil secret society? Who do you mean?</b>

59:09.950 --> 59:12.020
<b>You people, of course!</b>

59:12.020 --> 59:13.920
<b>Don't be absurd!</b>

59:16.030 --> 59:22.140
<b>You took my child! Clearly you're the bad guys!</b>

59:22.140 --> 59:24.110
<b>It's not like that!</b>

59:24.110 --> 59:25.580
<b>Calm down, Gamma!</b>

59:25.580 --> 59:27.890
<b>#2, go help him out!</b>

59:27.890 --> 59:28.850
<b>Right!</b>

59:30.360 --> 59:32.020
<b>Sorry.</b>

59:32.020 --> 59:33.760
<b>Don't butt in!</b>

59:33.760 --> 59:38.410
<b>W-What? You're Demon King Piccolo?</b>

59:38.410 --> 59:42.280
<b>I told you, I'm no demon king. It's just 'Piccolo' now.</b>

59:42.910 --> 59:44.180
<b>Piccolo-<i>san</i>?</b>

59:46.390 --> 59:48.690
<b>Seems you really did survive.</b>

59:48.690 --> 59:52.100
<b>Guess one beating wasn't enough for you to learn your lesson.</b>

59:52.100 --> 59:54.370
<b>I'm not quite the same as last time.</b>

59:54.370 --> 59:56.080
<b>Don't run away again!</b>

1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:05.100
<b>Piccolo, why are you here?</b>

1:00:05.730 --> 1:00:08.700
<b>I'll explain later! Focus on your fight!</b>

1:00:08.700 --> 1:00:10.540
<b>R-Right!</b>

1:00:14.010 --> 1:00:19.420
<b>How'd you improve in so short a time? Or were you hiding this power before?</b>

1:00:19.420 --> 1:00:22.290
<b>Hmph! I'm not telling!</b>

1:00:22.290 --> 1:00:23.520
<b>Still tight-lipped, huh?</b>

1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:28.440
<b>But sadly, you're still no match for me!</b>

1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:29.170
<b>What?</b>

1:00:36.020 --> 1:00:38.130
<b>Don't you ever get tired?</b>

1:00:38.130 --> 1:00:43.330
<b>I'm an android, so I can fight at full power until my energy runs out.</b>

1:00:43.330 --> 1:00:44.870
<b>How much energy do you have left?</b>

1:00:44.870 --> 1:00:46.910
<b>Still 82%!</b>

1:00:46.910 --> 1:00:48.710
<b>What?! Seriously?!</b>

1:00:49.110 --> 1:00:51.320
<b>Damn, you really are something!</b>

1:00:54.150 --> 1:00:57.230
<b>Even with this big of a power-up, I still can't keep up with him!</b>

1:00:57.230 --> 1:00:59.130
<b>Well, I am Dr. Hedo's masterpiece after all!</b>

1:00:59.130 --> 1:01:01.130
<b>It's a real shame.</b>

1:01:03.070 --> 1:01:05.110
<b>A shame? What do you mean?</b>

1:01:07.050 --> 1:01:11.890
<b>You're not a bad person. You're just following orders.</b>

1:01:17.010 --> 1:01:18.470
<b>So what?!</b>

1:01:20.110 --> 1:01:23.310
<b>T-That's what we were made for!</b>

1:01:23.310 --> 1:01:29.030
<b>Your orders come from Dr. Hedo. What if he's been misinformed by Magenta?</b>

1:01:29.030 --> 1:01:31.330
<b>That's not possible!</b>

1:01:45.430 --> 1:01:47.800
<b>You must at least suspect the truth.</b>

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:49.400
<b>Shut up!</b>

1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:08.910
<b><i>I've included a small bonus as well.</i></b>

1:02:40.070 --> 1:02:43.140
<b>Now what?!</b>

1:03:01.940 --> 1:03:06.780
<b>Beats me! Shenlong threw in one hell of a bonus!</b>

1:03:06.790 --> 1:03:08.530
<b>It…It can't be!</b>

1:03:08.530 --> 1:03:12.560
<b>What are you people doing?! Fire! Shoot him dead!</b>

1:03:18.380 --> 1:03:20.150
<b>Damn it!</b>

1:03:20.150 --> 1:03:21.280
<b>Commander.</b>

1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:23.050
<b>Yeah… We've got one last chance.</b>

1:03:27.970 --> 1:03:30.230
<b>T-Those guys!</b>

1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:34.010
<b>Hold it! Get back here!</b>

1:03:35.010 --> 1:03:36.570
<b>Commander, you run on ahead.</b>

1:03:36.580 --> 1:03:37.450
<b>Damn kid!</b>

1:03:42.220 --> 1:03:44.690
<b>What's the idea, Gamma?!</b>

1:03:44.690 --> 1:03:47.670
<b>I now know…</b>

1:03:47.670 --> 1:03:49.610
<b>who the bad guys are!</b>

1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:05.730
<b>Gohan! That's enough! Stop fighting!</b>

1:04:05.730 --> 1:04:08.610
<b>What… What happened?</b>

1:04:09.610 --> 1:04:13.580
<b>It seems we misunderstood each other.</b>

1:04:20.170 --> 1:04:22.200
<b>What are you doing?</b>

1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:23.900
<b>Don't tell me...!</b>

1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:27.080
<b>That's right! I'm going to activate Cell Max!</b>

1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:39.340
<b>Don't be a fool! The Gammas are still fighting!</b>

1:04:39.340 --> 1:04:46.580
<b>You're the fool! This was supposed to be an easy win! It's thanks to you that we're in this pinch!</b>

1:04:46.580 --> 1:04:51.830
<b>The Gammas are just confused! They can tell their enemies aren't evil!</b>

1:04:52.630 --> 1:04:56.910
<b>That wouldn't be a problem if you hadn't given them dumb ideas about being heroes!</b>

1:04:57.340 --> 1:05:01.520
<b>I've been looking forward to killing you!</b>

1:05:18.290 --> 1:05:19.390
<b>Alright!</b>

1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:24.660
<b>Dr. Hedo?!</b>

1:05:24.660 --> 1:05:31.240
<b>Did you forget? My skin's been modified to withstand shocks!</b>

1:05:37.220 --> 1:05:41.700
<b>Oh yeah… I do remember you saying that.</b>

1:05:41.700 --> 1:05:45.900
<b>However, I'm in the same boat!</b>

1:05:55.350 --> 1:06:01.500
<b>I'm no genius, but these modifications should be enough to beat you!</b>

1:06:04.510 --> 1:06:08.150
<b>Now you really are done for!</b>

1:06:10.390 --> 1:06:11.190
<b>Hachi-Maru!</b>

1:06:19.070 --> 1:06:26.350
<b>Didn't I tell you? As long as some part of you remains human, one poison sting from Hachi-Maru is all it takes!</b>

1:06:29.090 --> 1:06:34.060
<b>As a researcher, I couldn't resist your generous funds.</b>

1:06:34.060 --> 1:06:38.650
<b>I'll take all the money I want and escape with the Gammas.</b>

1:06:42.580 --> 1:06:46.790
<b>Oh... Crap!</b>

1:06:52.370 --> 1:06:54.170
<b>What's wrong, #2?</b>

1:06:54.170 --> 1:06:57.370
<b>It seems the situation has changed.</b>

1:07:04.390 --> 1:07:05.490
<b>Alright!</b>

1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:16.950
<b>I brought along some helping hands!</b>

1:07:16.950 --> 1:07:18.830
<b>Well, except for Kuririn!</b>

1:07:18.830 --> 1:07:24.530
<b>That hurts! I may not look it, but at the police station I'm known as a superhuman!</b>

1:07:25.030 --> 1:07:28.950
<b>Wow, how odd. Even my brother came to fight!</b>

1:07:28.950 --> 1:07:30.550
<b>Goten?</b>

1:07:32.620 --> 1:07:36.190
<b>Hang on, Pan-<i>chan</i>'s here too!</b>

1:07:36.190 --> 1:07:37.760
<b>How old are you now?</b>

1:07:37.770 --> 1:07:39.570
<b>Um… three!</b>

1:07:39.570 --> 1:07:42.740
<b>So those are the new androids?</b>

1:07:42.740 --> 1:07:43.140
<b>Yeah.</b>

1:07:43.140 --> 1:07:44.870
<b>They're kinda cool.</b>

1:07:44.870 --> 1:07:45.710
<b>Yeah!</b>

1:07:45.710 --> 1:07:48.240
<b>Don't tell me those two are…</b>

1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:50.420
<b>It's Trunks-<i>kun</i> and Goten-<i>kun</i>.</b>

1:07:50.420 --> 1:07:54.120
<b>They've really gotten big since the last time I saw them.</b>

1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:59.070
<b>Saiyans stay small for a long time, then hit a sudden growth spurt.</b>

1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:08.880
<b>What's going on? I thought you were fighting with those guys?</b>

1:08:08.890 --> 1:08:15.070
<b>Sorta. Say, where did my glasses go? I can't see too well.</b>

1:08:15.070 --> 1:08:18.480
<b>Does your eyesight get better when you transform?</b>

1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:36.470
<b>By the way Piccolo-<i>san</i>, what happened to you back there?</b>

1:08:36.470 --> 1:08:42.560
<b>It was incredible! You turned orange and your <i>ki</i> went through the roof.</b>

1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:47.590
<b>Orange? Huh, I couldn't tell.</b>

1:08:47.590 --> 1:08:51.410
<b>In short, you might say I've awakened just like you.</b>

1:08:51.410 --> 1:08:53.740
<b>You looked super cool, Piccolo-<i>san</i>!</b>

1:08:53.740 --> 1:08:57.510
<b>You should give it a name, like with Super Saiyan.</b>

1:08:57.510 --> 1:09:00.830
<b>A name? Why bother?</b>

1:09:00.830 --> 1:09:03.830
<b>Oh well, I suppose if I did give it a name, it'd be… Orange Piccolo.</b>

1:09:03.830 --> 1:09:05.970
<b>Orange Piccolo…?</b>

1:09:51.130 --> 1:09:52.400
<b>What's that?</b>

1:10:04.990 --> 1:10:08.160
<b>It's Cell… Cell Max is active!</b>

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:10.070
<b>Cell Max?</b>

1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:33.280
<b>Doctor!</b>

1:10:52.580 --> 1:10:53.820
<b>W-What is that?!</b>

1:10:57.420 --> 1:10:59.300
<b>No way! It's a huge Cell!</b>

1:11:03.870 --> 1:11:05.070
<b>D-Damn it!</b>

1:11:05.070 --> 1:11:06.270
<b>#2!</b>

1:11:07.910 --> 1:11:09.920
<b>Let's do this!</b>

1:11:15.990 --> 1:11:17.760
<b>Let's go too!</b>

1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:19.830
<b>You mean… all of us?</b>

1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:21.740
<b>Gohan! Here's a Senzu!</b>

1:11:26.250 --> 1:11:28.150
<b>H-Hang on!</b>

1:11:29.630 --> 1:11:31.430
<b>How could you drop it?!</b>

1:11:31.430 --> 1:11:33.730
<b>Sorry, I don't have my glasses!</b>

1:11:33.730 --> 1:11:36.400
<b>Fine! You'll just have to fight without a Senzu!</b>

1:11:37.430 --> 1:11:40.480
<b>R-Right! Bulma, take care of Pan!</b>

1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:41.620
<b>Leave it to me!</b>

1:11:43.620 --> 1:11:45.490
<b>This looks like fun! Let's go!</b>

1:11:45.490 --> 1:11:46.820
<b>OK!</b>

1:11:48.590 --> 1:11:50.330
<b>Guess we gotta!</b>

1:11:51.170 --> 1:11:53.040
<b>Yeah! Go get 'em!</b>

1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:55.910
<b>I'll protect Bulma and Pan!</b>

1:11:55.910 --> 1:11:58.070
<b>You sure picked a cushy job.</b>

1:12:20.890 --> 1:12:22.200
<b>Don't forget us!</b>

1:12:26.130 --> 1:12:27.370
<b>Kamehame—</b>

1:12:27.370 --> 1:12:29.200
<b>HA!</b>

1:12:38.790 --> 1:12:39.990
<b>Damn!</b>

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.300
<b>Aim for the top of his head! That's his one weakness!</b>

1:12:43.300 --> 1:12:45.610
<b>The top of his head?!</b>

1:12:45.610 --> 1:12:50.480
<b>The doctor figured something like this might happen, so he gave Cell Max a weakness just in case.</b>

1:12:50.490 --> 1:12:51.420
<b>A weakness?</b>

1:12:51.420 --> 1:12:54.060
<b>But you must be willing to lay down your life!</b>

1:12:54.060 --> 1:13:00.060
<b>Hitting Cell Max's weakness triggers an explosion that wipes out every cell in his body!</b>

1:13:00.070 --> 1:13:01.940
<b>You'll die too!</b>

1:13:19.570 --> 1:13:20.780
<b>Gohan!</b>

1:13:23.750 --> 1:13:27.020
<b>Aim for the head, he says! At this rate, we'll never hit it!</b>

1:13:28.250 --> 1:13:29.490
<b>Damn, he's so fast!</b>

1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:34.040
<b>Take this!</b>

1:13:41.890 --> 1:13:43.320
<b>Got you!</b>

1:13:50.610 --> 1:13:51.610
<b>He did it!</b>

1:13:55.010 --> 1:13:56.510
<b>It didn't work…</b>

1:14:07.970 --> 1:14:09.500
<b>N-No fair!</b>

1:14:17.750 --> 1:14:19.090
<b>Pan!</b>

1:14:20.970 --> 1:14:23.440
<b>Pan, fly!</b>

1:14:33.660 --> 1:14:35.460
<b>Pan, are you ok?!</b>

1:14:35.460 --> 1:14:36.330
<b>Yep!</b>

1:14:36.330 --> 1:14:38.160
<b>Thank goodness!</b>

1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:41.230
<b>See, good thing I was around!</b>

1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:47.450
<b>Guess so! But it would've been better if I'd brought along the plane so we could escape.</b>

1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:52.630
<b>Hey Goten, let's fuse! We can use Fusion!</b>

1:14:52.630 --> 1:14:56.200
<b>Fusion? Gee, I'm not sure I remember how.</b>

1:14:58.130 --> 1:15:01.410
<b>Fu… sion… Ha!</b>

1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:10.360
<b>I… I blew it! Damn, guess I'll just have to make do!</b>

1:15:11.570 --> 1:15:13.200
<b>Super Saiyan!</b>

1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:16.710
<b>H-Huh…?</b>

1:15:18.470 --> 1:15:22.060
<b>Rats! In that case… charge!</b>

1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:30.930
<b>Bullseye!</b>

1:15:39.220 --> 1:15:41.890
<b>It's the first time a failed fusion has come in handy!</b>

1:15:53.620 --> 1:15:55.320
<b>Crap!</b>

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:01.220
<b>We'll have to use stronger attacks…</b>

1:16:01.230 --> 1:16:03.700
<b>Hey, you guys!</b>

1:16:03.700 --> 1:16:08.140
<b>Keep your distance and fire on Cell Max all at once!</b>

1:16:08.140 --> 1:16:10.610
<b>Anywhere on his body is fine!</b>

1:16:10.610 --> 1:16:12.260
<b>What are you planning?</b>

1:16:12.260 --> 1:16:14.690
<b>Don't tell me you're—</b>

1:16:16.130 --> 1:16:17.190
<b>Stop!</b>

1:16:17.190 --> 1:16:18.190
<b>Too late!</b>

1:16:18.190 --> 1:16:19.900
<b>Then I should go too!</b>

1:16:19.900 --> 1:16:22.840
<b>#1, go save Dr. Hedo.</b>

1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:23.880
<b>What?!</b>

1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:25.880
<b>Check your Life Scope.</b>

1:16:27.180 --> 1:16:29.380
<b>The doctor's not dead yet.</b>

1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:34.560
<b>You're too lax.</b>

1:16:41.450 --> 1:16:47.290
<b>Do it now! Then once I attack, run as far as you can!</b>

1:16:48.550 --> 1:16:51.190
<b>What's he going to do?</b>

1:16:51.190 --> 1:16:52.770
<b>He's going to charge.</b>

1:16:56.770 --> 1:16:59.040
<b>W-What are they doing?</b>

1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:02.110
<b>It looks like they're attacking all at once.</b>

1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:03.060
<b>I'd better join them!</b>

1:17:03.060 --> 1:17:05.890
<b>Kuririn, be careful!</b>

1:17:32.150 --> 1:17:33.050
<b>Oh no!</b>

1:17:33.050 --> 1:17:34.620
<b>Kienzan!</b>

1:17:36.290 --> 1:17:37.620
<b>Kuririn-<i>san</i>!</b>

1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:38.920
<b>#18-<i>san</i>!</b>

1:17:38.920 --> 1:17:39.860
<b>I owe you one.</b>

1:17:41.690 --> 1:17:43.740
<b>Here he comes! Get away!</b>

1:17:43.740 --> 1:17:45.640
<b>Everyone, close your eyes!</b>

1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:47.710
<b>Taiyo-Ken!</b>

1:17:51.210 --> 1:17:54.390
<b>Yay! Spanky spank!</b>

1:18:09.250 --> 1:18:10.450
<b>Go!</b>

1:18:32.020 --> 1:18:33.970
<b>He… He did it!</b>

1:18:36.570 --> 1:18:37.910
<b>It's not over yet!</b>

1:18:53.740 --> 1:18:57.050
<b>Stop!</b>

1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:13.220
<b>How ya like that?!</b>

1:19:26.470 --> 1:19:29.310
<b>Piccolo, grow big!</b>

1:19:29.310 --> 1:19:30.240
<b>What?</b>

1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:33.250
<b>Back in the old days, you grew into a giant, right?</b>

1:19:33.260 --> 1:19:35.360
<b>At the Tenkaichi Budokai!</b>

1:19:36.590 --> 1:19:39.930
<b>That's right! I'd forgotten!</b>

1:19:50.250 --> 1:19:51.550
<b>Yeah!</b>

1:20:04.550 --> 1:20:10.220
<b>Piccolo-<i>san</i>, can you beat him now that you're so big?</b>

1:20:10.220 --> 1:20:11.960
<b>It's not that simple.</b>

1:20:11.960 --> 1:20:16.870
<b>Although I'm bigger, my strength's not much different than before. This is just a bluff.</b>

1:20:18.210 --> 1:20:18.870
<b>I know!</b>

1:20:19.940 --> 1:20:22.380
<b>Hm? It's hard to find it when I'm this size.</b>

1:20:22.780 --> 1:20:24.360
<b>There it is!</b>

1:20:24.360 --> 1:20:28.590
<b>It's the Senzu I was planning to eat. You can have it.</b>

1:20:28.590 --> 1:20:31.330
<b>You didn't eat it earlier?</b>

1:20:31.330 --> 1:20:34.280
<b>Then you should take it.</b>

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.310
<b>Just eat it!</b>

1:20:35.310 --> 1:20:36.610
<b>But…</b>

1:20:36.610 --> 1:20:38.480
<b>I've got a plan.</b>

1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:40.480
<b>A-Alright.</b>

1:20:51.370 --> 1:20:54.120
<b>Gohan, listen up!</b>

1:20:54.120 --> 1:20:57.990
<b>If you put your mind to it, you could be the strongest in this world.</b>

1:20:57.990 --> 1:21:02.220
<b>Believe in yourself, and cut loose!</b>

1:21:02.220 --> 1:21:05.200
<b>Let me see your true power!</b>

1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:08.240
<b>And use it to save the world!</b>

1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:08.970
<b>I will!</b>

1:21:10.910 --> 1:21:11.810
<b>Here goes!</b>

1:22:01.610 --> 1:22:04.790
<b>Damn it! You guys, get over here!</b>

1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:11.660
<b>Gohan!</b>

1:22:11.660 --> 1:22:12.430
<b>Yes!</b>

1:22:12.430 --> 1:22:15.710
<b>I'll knock that bastard to the ground!</b>

1:22:15.710 --> 1:22:19.180
<b>Once you see your chance, use a Kamehameha or something.</b>

1:22:19.180 --> 1:22:22.920
<b>Charge up all the power you can and then pierce through his head!</b>

1:22:22.920 --> 1:22:24.620
<b>U-Understood!</b>

1:22:24.630 --> 1:22:26.230
<b>All the power you can manage!</b>

1:22:26.230 --> 1:22:30.540
<b>Don't hold back! Pack everything into this one attack!</b>

1:22:30.540 --> 1:22:31.600
<b>Yes!</b>

1:22:32.670 --> 1:22:33.600
<b>Here he comes.</b>

1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:48.270
<b>Gohan!</b>

1:22:48.270 --> 1:22:49.210
<b>Right!</b>

1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:07.850
<b>Piccolo-<i>san</i>!</b>

1:23:08.350 --> 1:23:09.550
<b>Stay away!</b>

1:23:09.550 --> 1:23:11.650
<b>Concentrate your <i>ki</i>!</b>

1:23:12.250 --> 1:23:15.800
<b>The real battle… begins now!</b>

1:23:26.620 --> 1:23:28.220
<b>Gohan, aren't you ready yet?!</b>

1:23:28.220 --> 1:23:30.320
<b>Piccolo's gonna die!</b>

1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:32.020
<b>Just a… little more…</b>

1:23:40.210 --> 1:23:41.340
<b>You idiot!</b>

1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:01.380
<b>Damn it…</b>

1:24:03.290 --> 1:24:05.530
<b>If I don't stop him…</b>

1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:22.660
<b>At this rate, Piccolo-<i>san</i> will…</b>

1:24:22.990 --> 1:24:24.060
<b>Hold it!</b>

1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:27.170
<b>I swear… I'll stop… him…</b>

1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:51.840
<b>That all you got?</b>

1:25:54.010 --> 1:25:55.920
<b>Now it's my turn!</b>

1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:41.340
<b>Gohan!</b>

1:27:05.510 --> 1:27:07.530
<b>Simmer down!</b>

1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:15.980
<b>Gohan! Fire!</b>

1:27:18.450 --> 1:27:23.920
<b>Makankosappo!</b>

1:28:01.630 --> 1:28:03.770
<b>He did it! He really did it!</b>

1:28:03.770 --> 1:28:06.610
<b>He's gonna blow! Get away!</b>

1:28:28.790 --> 1:28:31.990
<b>Thank goodness we got away in time.</b>

1:28:31.990 --> 1:28:34.860
<b>Oh, that monster is gone.</b>

1:28:34.860 --> 1:28:37.110
<b>I wonder if everyone's OK.</b>

1:28:41.780 --> 1:28:43.710
<b>Looks like they're all safe.</b>

1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:08.430
<b>You look good orange.</b>

1:29:08.430 --> 1:29:11.170
<b>You're quite a sight yourself. Oh?</b>

1:29:11.770 --> 1:29:12.430
<b>Yikes!</b>

1:29:42.100 --> 1:29:45.270
<b>We never could have won without their help.</b>

1:29:45.270 --> 1:29:50.520
<b>Even Dad or Vegeta might not have been able to beat that Cell monster.</b>

1:29:50.520 --> 1:29:54.190
<b>That's why I told you never to let your guard down, even when things seem peaceful.</b>

1:29:54.190 --> 1:29:57.090
<b>You were right! I'm sorry.</b>

1:29:57.100 --> 1:30:00.230
<b>By the way, just now you fired a—</b>

1:30:00.230 --> 1:30:03.300
<b>It was supposed to be a Makankosappo.</b>

1:30:03.300 --> 1:30:04.440
<b>When did you learn that?</b>

1:30:05.840 --> 1:30:09.250
<b>I've been practicing in secret.</b>

1:30:11.920 --> 1:30:14.090
<b>It was marvelous.</b>

1:30:39.150 --> 1:30:40.850
<b>Is he dead?</b>

1:30:40.850 --> 1:30:42.320
<b>Yes.</b>

1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:46.120
<b>I tried to save him, but it was no use.</b>

1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:49.270
<b>What did he do back there?</b>

1:30:50.970 --> 1:30:53.740
<b>He used up all his remaining energy in one burst.</b>

1:30:53.740 --> 1:30:57.040
<b>Thanks to him, Cell's attack power dropped.</b>

1:30:59.850 --> 1:31:02.760
<b>He was a superhero.</b>

1:31:04.290 --> 1:31:05.890
<b>You people are the real heroes.</b>

1:31:05.890 --> 1:31:09.370
<b>Thank you. You saved the world.</b>

1:31:09.370 --> 1:31:11.940
<b>#2 is the one you should thank.</b>

1:31:11.940 --> 1:31:13.710
<b>It's all my fault.</b>

1:31:13.710 --> 1:31:16.580
<b>I'm the one who created Cell Max.</b>

1:31:16.580 --> 1:31:19.090
<b>#2 took responsibility for my mistakes.</b>

1:31:20.290 --> 1:31:23.300
<b>Weren't you just being used?</b>

1:31:23.300 --> 1:31:25.730
<b>No, somehow I could tell what was really going on.</b>

1:31:25.730 --> 1:31:28.180
<b>I just wanted their research funds.</b>

1:31:29.180 --> 1:31:32.820
<b>Still, I'm amazed you survived.</b>

1:31:32.820 --> 1:31:37.360
<b>I've modified my skin to endure small shocks.</b>

1:31:37.360 --> 1:31:41.000
<b>You modified your skin?! That's kinda creepy!</b>

1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:43.240
<b>How's that any different from getting rid of crow's feet?</b>

1:31:43.240 --> 1:31:45.540
<b>That was Trunks talking, wasn't it?!</b>

1:31:47.650 --> 1:31:51.790
<b>By the way Goten-<i>kun</i>, could you keep today a secret from Chi-Chi?</b>

1:31:51.790 --> 1:31:55.160
<b>If she found out I invited you to this battle, she'd kill me!</b>

1:31:55.160 --> 1:31:55.930
<b>You got it!</b>

1:31:55.930 --> 1:32:00.470
<b>Your name was Dr. Hedo, wasn't it? What will you do now?</b>

1:32:02.140 --> 1:32:06.650
<b>Gamma and I will turn ourselves in to the police.</b>

1:32:06.650 --> 1:32:09.390
<b>N-N-No! You've gotta be kidding!</b>

1:32:09.390 --> 1:32:12.630
<b>The cops wouldn't know what to do with you!</b>

1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:16.600
<b>Why not just pretend this all never happened?</b>

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:21.350
<b>You guys weren't good, but you weren't evil either.</b>

1:32:22.380 --> 1:32:24.290
<b>Then…</b>

1:32:24.290 --> 1:32:28.590
<b>Would you let me and Gamma work at Capsule Corporation?</b>

1:32:28.600 --> 1:32:33.040
<b>Huh?! No way! How dare you ask that?!</b>

1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:36.410
<b>…Say, are you any good with cosmetics?</b>

1:32:36.410 --> 1:32:37.580
<b>Cosmetics?</b>

1:32:37.580 --> 1:32:38.620
<b>Come over here.</b>

1:32:41.990 --> 1:32:44.660
<b>Like, could you make skin look younger?</b>

1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:49.240
<b>Well… obviously I know all about biology</b>

1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:51.240
<b>and I have a medical license as well</b>

1:32:51.240 --> 1:32:52.810
<b>so that should be simple.</b>

1:32:52.810 --> 1:32:54.080
<b>I see.</b>

1:32:54.080 --> 1:32:58.080
<b>Your amazing abilities are perfect for our company.</b>

1:32:58.090 --> 1:33:00.930
<b>Plus you've got an outstanding bodyguard.</b>

1:33:00.930 --> 1:33:05.470
<b>And I certainly don't want to let you go off and plot more evil schemes.</b>

1:33:05.470 --> 1:33:07.030
<b>What do you say, Piccolo?</b>

1:33:07.030 --> 1:33:08.600
<b>I've got no objection.</b>

1:33:08.610 --> 1:33:12.550
<b>And it means you won't have to use the dragon balls for that crap anymore. Right?</b>

1:33:12.550 --> 1:33:16.220
<b>Shut it! OK, that settles it! You're hired!</b>

1:33:16.220 --> 1:33:17.820
<b>Thank you so much!</b>

1:33:17.820 --> 1:33:19.300
<b>Hey, thank her too!</b>

1:33:19.300 --> 1:33:20.570
<b>Thank you very much!</b>

1:33:58.140 --> 1:34:02.180
<b>Tomorrow you'll begin the next step of your training!</b>

1:34:04.020 --> 1:34:05.350
<b>Yeah!</b>

1:38:11.210 --> 1:38:12.950
<b>Alright.</b>

1:38:30.790 --> 1:38:33.660
<b>I lose!</b>

1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:36.830
<b>Oh, right.</b>

1:38:36.830 --> 1:38:39.730
<b>Vegeta-<i>san</i> is the winner!</b>

1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:43.540
<b>I… I did it.</b>

1:38:43.540 --> 1:38:51.030
<b>I fi… finally beat… Kakarot!</b>

1:38:56.130 --> 1:38:57.870
<b>I really… did it…</b>

1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:03.180
<b>Good grief! So they finally finished.</b>

1:39:03.180 --> 1:39:05.150
<b>How dumb was that?</b>

1:39:05.150 --> 1:39:07.150
<b>Right, Broly?</b>

1:39:10.930 --> 1:39:13.000
<b>Men are…</b>

1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000
<b>...such morons!</b>

1:39:18.930 --> 1:39:23.410
<b>Huh? Did you need something, Bulma?</b>

1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:26.210
<b>Sheesh, took you long enough, Whis!</b>

1:39:26.230 --> 1:39:31.000
<b>My sincerest apologies. By the way, do you have anything tasty over there?</b>

1:39:31.750 --> 1:39:36.420
<b>I did, but it’s cold now. You’ll have to come over next time. Later!</b>

1:39:37.910 --> 1:39:40.910
<b>My, I wonder what that was all about…?</b>
