00:00.010 --> 00:01.910
Previously on Broadchurch...

00:01.960 --> 00:04.870
Did you recognise the
man carrying the body?

00:04.920 --> 00:07.630
~ Yeah, I did.
~ Can you name that man for the court?

00:07.680 --> 00:10.320
Nigel Carter. He's my son.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.790
There's going to be a
charity in Danny's name.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.230
There's a small group. They
work with known sex offenders.

00:17.280 --> 00:20.510
A girl's body is still missing.
The killer is walking free.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.790
That case is tainted.
That's my failing.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.590
~ I said I was with Lee all night.
~ Was that true?

00:26.640 --> 00:28.950
No, I was at a friend's house.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.350
~ What happened that night?
~ He drugged me.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.630
I woke up at 5.00am and he
was cleaning the whole house.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.830
~ Sorry to hear about you and Ricky.
~ It was a long time coming.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.070
Even the moment his daughter
was being killed

00:41.120 --> 00:42.990
he was shagging one
of the bridesmaids.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.070
You were at the wedding together? You said
you were together. You never mentioned that.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.470
~ Ricky.
~ You leave Cate alone.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.990
Why would a father not
want an investigation

00:52.040 --> 00:53.710
into the death of his own daughter?

00:53.760 --> 00:56.360
What if Lee Ashworth didn't do it?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:32.120 --> 01:35.560
Come in, sweetheart. She won't bite.

01:40.030 --> 01:41.030
Hey.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.830
~ You're not gonna cry, are you, Mum?
~ No.

01:43.880 --> 01:47.600
~ Don't talk to your mum like that.
~ It's fine, thanks, Luce.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.800
~ Thanks for agreeing to see me.
~ Aunt Lucy said I had to.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.080
How's school?

01:59.200 --> 02:01.630
Tell me about the trial.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.190
Really?

02:03.240 --> 02:06.030
Did you think we're not
going to mention it?

02:06.080 --> 02:07.790
Right, OK, er...

02:07.840 --> 02:10.229
Well, it's hard seeing
your dad there.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.630
If you're so sure he did it,
why is he pleading 'not guilty'?

02:13.680 --> 02:16.030
I wish I knew but I think
because he's scared

02:16.080 --> 02:20.270
and I think he can't bear to face up
to what's happened. People do that.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.590
Well, you've got it wrong.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.680
Tom, I know you want that to
be true and I know you blame me.

02:27.760 --> 02:32.230
But your dad killed Danny and if I
could have spotted what was going on

02:32.280 --> 02:36.800
or if I could go back and make it
un-happen, I would, but I can't.

02:39.840 --> 02:43.430
Who is on his side? Who's
speaking up for Dad?

02:43.480 --> 02:46.830
You don't have to worry about
him. He's got a good barrister.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.070
But what I wanted to suggest was
that you came back to live with me

02:51.120 --> 02:53.910
and I give up the flat and
we go back to the house.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.430
No.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.270
~ Would you just listen for a moment?
~ No!

02:58.320 --> 03:00.400
I am not going back.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.400
Well, soon, yeah?

03:06.840 --> 03:08.040
No.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.960
OK. Can I at least have a hug?

03:29.680 --> 03:33.000
I love you, even more than chocolate.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.310
You don't have to come with
me to question this woman.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.910
No, I want to. My life
has all gone to shit.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.670
At least fixing your mess
gives me a distraction.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.110
Are you going to move back in here?

04:19.160 --> 04:23.030
Only when I've got Tom
back. Are we going or not?

04:23.080 --> 04:25.430
Where did you say you were from?

04:25.480 --> 04:28.950
South Mercia police. We're
looking at an old case.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.110
On 14 April 2012, were
you the bridesmaid

04:31.160 --> 04:33.990
for Martin and Esther Kelly's
wedding at Longthorne Hotel?

04:34.040 --> 04:36.550
I don't know if that was the
date but I was at the wedding.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.590
Did you have sex with a man called
Ricky Gillespie that night?

04:39.640 --> 04:42.150
Wow, you don't mess about!

04:42.200 --> 04:45.310
You mean Ricky whose girl was killed?

04:45.360 --> 04:46.350
Yeah.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.550
No, I didn't. I mean, he tried
it on. He was after me all night.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.390
He even followed me to my room
when I went to change my shoes,

04:53.440 --> 04:54.950
cos my heels were killing me,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.190
and he had this little
silver hip flask.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.590
He kept trying to make
me have a drink with him

05:00.640 --> 05:04.030
but I threw him out. A bit much.
He was there with his wife.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.310
The last I saw, he was heading
back through the car park.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.510
~ How long was he in your room for?
~ Five or ten minutes.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.760
I didn't see him for
the rest of the evening.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.830
Cate Gillespie was wrong. Ricky
wasn't with another woman.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.990
Nobody saw him for two
hours. Where was he?

05:23.040 --> 05:25.750
And who takes a hip
flask to a wedding?

05:25.800 --> 05:28.630
Do you think he was
going to drug her?

05:28.680 --> 05:32.310
I haven't heard any reports of
him trying that sort of thing.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.110
Claire said that's what
Lee used to do to her.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.070
Do think it's something all
four of them used to do?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.880
I don't know.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.460
When we're done in court
today we'll talk to her.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.240
When was the last time you
had your eyesight tested?

05:56.400 --> 05:58.710
What about your night vision?

05:58.760 --> 06:00.790
Ever had that tested?

06:00.840 --> 06:02.710
Never had a test.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.830
But I eat a lot of carrots.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.270
So, you have no idea
how far you can see

06:09.320 --> 06:12.350
either in the daytime or at night?

06:12.400 --> 06:16.270
I can see the moon and
that's a fair distance.

06:16.320 --> 06:21.440
Very good. Can we turn
to your son, Mr Carter?

06:23.520 --> 06:27.070
You hadn't seen him
for 28 years, had you?

06:27.120 --> 06:30.390
I know what he looks like, if
that's what you're getting at.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.790
In Mr Carter's sworn statement
to the police he says,

06:34.840 --> 06:37.350
"I don't even know who she is."

06:37.400 --> 06:39.910
"I don't want anything
to do with her."

06:39.960 --> 06:43.750
Police got it wrong. Police
get it wrong all the time.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.990
~ It's a fact.
~ It's not, actually.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.590
I thought you'd prepped her.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.710
~ She's a bloody liability!
~ She wasn't like this with me.

06:51.760 --> 06:55.390
Stick to answering the questions
you've been asked, Miss Wright.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.830
OK!

06:56.880 --> 06:59.550
When you first saw Danny's
body on the beach,

06:59.600 --> 07:01.910
why didn't you call for an ambulance?

07:01.960 --> 07:03.390
A bit late by then.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.110
You seem very certain. Did you check?

07:07.160 --> 07:11.430
~ Are you medically qualified?
~ It was obvious what had happened.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.950
Why didn't you call the police?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.920
I didn't want to dump Nigel in it.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.310
How do you explain police
forensics finding

07:22.360 --> 07:26.630
four cigarette butts with your
DNA on them next to Danny's body?

07:26.680 --> 07:29.470
I've smoked a lot of
cigarettes on that beach.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.750
~ Why did you take the skateboard?
~ I thought it might get nicked.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.270
It did get nicked, didn't it? By you!

07:36.320 --> 07:39.600
I thought the family
would want it back.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.100
Do you know who Maggie Radcliffe is?

07:45.760 --> 07:47.270
No.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.990
The editor of the Broadchurch Echo.

07:51.120 --> 07:56.830
Whose office you broke into around
11.37pm on 24 July, 2013

07:56.880 --> 08:01.150
and whom you threatened
by saying, and I quote,

08:01.200 --> 08:03.270
"I know men who would rape you."

08:03.320 --> 08:06.440
~ What?
~ I don't have that.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.350
Not true.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.670
What's not true? You don't
know men like that or you do?

08:14.720 --> 08:16.230
I never said it!

08:16.280 --> 08:18.520
Why would she lie?

08:19.760 --> 08:22.320
~ She's a journalist.
~ Right!

08:23.440 --> 08:27.960
Journalists and police lie and
you're the only honest woman here.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.230
If you like.

08:32.280 --> 08:36.230
Isn't it true that every word
you have told this court

08:36.280 --> 08:39.350
since you stood up in the
witness box is a lie?

08:39.400 --> 08:41.510
~ No.
~ You didn't see Nigel Carter.

08:41.559 --> 08:44.150
~ You saw Joe Miller.
~ No!

08:44.200 --> 08:47.670
But you want to pin the blame
on the son who's rejected you.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.710
No!

08:48.760 --> 08:51.110
You've lied to this
court time and again,

08:51.160 --> 08:53.030
just as you've lied to the police!

08:53.080 --> 08:57.360
~ No!
~ Why should the jury believe
a single word you say?

09:00.480 --> 09:02.680
You ain't all that.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.630
I wouldn't have gone anywhere
near her if I'd seen that!

09:09.680 --> 09:10.910
I know. I'm sorry!

09:10.960 --> 09:14.150
Do you know what, maybe if
you spent a little less time

09:14.200 --> 09:17.830
trying to tell me how to do my job
and a bit more time on your own work

09:17.880 --> 09:20.820
we'd stand a chance
of getting him off.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.280
Chin up.

09:45.080 --> 09:48.020
Did you enjoy yourself,
lying in there?

09:49.160 --> 09:51.670
It's not my husband in the dock.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.790
~ I suppose you knew all along.
~ No!

09:54.840 --> 09:56.870
Of course you did.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.750
We all know.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.990
~ We all turn a blind eye.
~ Not me - that's not what happened.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.830
Of course not(!)

10:03.880 --> 10:06.620
You just keep telling yourself that.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.910
~ Are you all right?
~ They'll always think I knew.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.790
No matter what the verdict, they'll
always think I was in on it.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.470
Just give them time.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.670
Oh, brilliant(!)

10:36.720 --> 10:41.190
Thanks for that shitty platitude.
That's fixed everything(!)

10:41.240 --> 10:44.350
~ Does Claire know we're coming?
~ No.

10:46.600 --> 10:50.840
I want you to tell me what you
told Miller about that night.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.710
That was supposed to be between us.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.110
There are no secrets
between him and me.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.430
Oh! Is that right?

10:59.480 --> 11:03.350
Claire, I don't care what you've
said before. I want the truth now.

11:03.400 --> 11:07.680
That night I went to see a friend,
Marie, like I told you before.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.480
Except...

11:11.560 --> 11:15.710
I didn't stay over. I came home
and I had a drink with Lee.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.880
I think he spiked my
drink with Rohypnol.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.190
I was out for a long time and
when I woke, it was morning.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.550
~ He was cleaning.
~ What sort of cleaning?

11:26.600 --> 11:28.740
Bathroom. Washing linen.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.470
Hoovering. Washing floors. He
said he fancied a spring clean.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.390
So, he's drugged you, now
he's cleaning the house

11:36.440 --> 11:39.390
and the next morning two girls get
reported missing from next door

11:39.440 --> 11:41.350
but you don't think to tell anyone?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.510
I didn't want to think
it was possible.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.750
What about now?

11:44.800 --> 11:47.270
~ Do you think he could
have killed those girls?
~ No.

11:47.320 --> 11:51.030
This is now the third version of
that night you've come up with.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.790
Why couldn't you tell me this before?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.830
I didn't want you knowing
what he used to do.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.950
What are you doing?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.940
Whose number's that?

12:02.960 --> 12:04.830
I don't know. It was
an incoming call.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.030
~ It was a wrong number.
~ It was an outgoing call.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.550
Because I called it back to
check and it just rang and-

12:09.600 --> 12:12.510
This area code, that's
where you lived with Lee.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.870
~ Now I feel I'm being questioned!
~ Too bloody right!

12:14.920 --> 12:17.710
You were my key witness and now
you say you're lying all along.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.150
~ I'm not lying!
~ What, then?

12:19.200 --> 12:21.070
~ Trying to protect him.
~ Him or yourself?

12:21.120 --> 12:22.430
That's not fair!

12:22.480 --> 12:25.550
So this is now definitively, this
is what happened that night?

12:25.600 --> 12:26.800
Yes.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.640
Really?

12:36.240 --> 12:38.120
Claire?

12:40.280 --> 12:42.080
There is erm...

12:47.400 --> 12:50.430
He was here when you went away
and we had sex upstairs.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.990
~ What, Claire?!
~ You left me alone, Alec.

12:53.040 --> 12:57.440
I've told you, he's like a drug.
I can't stop myself! I can't!

13:05.440 --> 13:07.070
~ Come on, Miller.
~ Are you going?

13:07.120 --> 13:10.710
~ I don't want to be on my own.
~ Child care. Sorry.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.150
What happens now, then?

13:12.200 --> 13:13.540
Miller!

13:26.800 --> 13:29.270
The thing we were speaking about -

13:29.320 --> 13:31.230
meeting reformed sex offenders.

13:31.280 --> 13:35.310
~ I've managed to arrange it for you.
~ Oh, right. That was quick.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.830
You still want to do it?

13:36.880 --> 13:40.270
I think so. I don't know.
I'm a bit scared of it.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.630
Maggie and I will be there too.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.990
I know you've got a lot on with the
trial, so if you want to delay...

13:47.040 --> 13:49.580
~ No, it's good.
~ What about Mark?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.800
I'll talk to him.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.950
OK, I'd better go, but I'll let you
know the details once it's all set.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.320
~ OK. Bye-bye.
~ Bye.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.940
Aren't you a beautiful little girlie?

14:16.920 --> 14:20.120
You are, aren't you? You are, I know.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.430
(Yeah. Little wriggler, aren't you?)

14:25.480 --> 14:27.630
~ Showing her the sights?
~ Yeah.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.070
Telling her what's
happening in court.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.550
She doesn't want to hear that!

14:31.600 --> 14:33.830
Of course she does
- she's interested.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.790
Who's sticking up for
us, who's telling lies.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.470
How are you feeling?

14:38.520 --> 14:42.360
Yeah. You know we talked about
doing something in Danny's name?

14:43.800 --> 14:46.630
~ Right...
~ What have you got that voice on for?

14:46.680 --> 14:49.910
~ I haven't got any voice on.
~ Yeah, like you're not interested.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.670
~ Do we have to talk about this?
~ Why won't you engage with this?

14:52.720 --> 14:54.230
I don't understand why...

14:54.280 --> 14:57.350
I don't understand why you
need to do it, I really don't.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.910
You're picking at a scab,
trying to make it bleed.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.630
~ What?
~ Look at what we've got here.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.630
She'll be grown up before we know it
and I don't want to miss that again.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.550
I want to be here for
her, every moment.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.910
I'm here for her, but I can
still think about Danny.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.110
It's not one or the other.
I need to do this.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.560
Fine. I don't.

15:19.440 --> 15:23.510
We sent you a letter asking you to
be a character witness for Joe Miller.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.150
~ Joe is really relying on you.
~ I've said no.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.070
Joe Miller is guilty.

15:28.120 --> 15:32.480
Has he ever categorically
confessed his guilt to you?

15:34.280 --> 15:37.190
No.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.470
Why not let the jury decide?

15:39.520 --> 15:42.190
Besides, if you're so
sure about his guilt,

15:42.240 --> 15:44.710
why have you been visiting him?

15:45.200 --> 15:46.830
He told you?

15:46.880 --> 15:49.950
There are no secrets between
a barrister and her client.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.030
Like the Seal of the Confessional.

15:52.080 --> 15:56.510
I went to see him because I believe
in forgiveness and redemption.

15:56.560 --> 16:00.110
I hoped to find a repentant
man, but since you showed up

16:00.160 --> 16:01.950
that seems to have
gone out the window.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.310
You gave the service
at Danny's funeral.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.670
I did.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.020
Do the Latimers know you've
been visiting Joe?

16:09.080 --> 16:11.790
~ What is this? Bad cop, bad cop?
~ Look...

16:11.840 --> 16:14.830
I get it. You don't
want to give evidence,

16:14.880 --> 16:17.990
because you're worried the
Latimers will feel betrayed.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.070
That is not it!

16:19.120 --> 16:22.750
"All have sinned and fall
short of the glory of God."

16:22.800 --> 16:24.750
Romans 3.23.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.750
You are not the only
churchgoer here, Reverend.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.830
Now, a member of your
parish is in crisis.

16:31.880 --> 16:35.040
Are you really going to desert
him in his hour of need?

16:36.360 --> 16:39.720
Have another think
about it, would you?

16:42.360 --> 16:44.300
I like your church.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.230
See? It's good to get out.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.910
You spend way too much
time around dead people.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.350
Shall I just keep talking or are
you going to join in at some point?

17:03.400 --> 17:06.030
Becca, there's something
I want to tell you.

17:06.079 --> 17:09.020
I've been visiting
Joe Miller in prison.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.599
Praying with him.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.460
You're kidding.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.670
I thought I could save him.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.160
I thought he was repentant.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.260
Repentant? Have you not
been at the trial?!

17:25.560 --> 17:28.230
Becca, I think I've made a mistake.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.800
I just needed to tell someone.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.200
Say something.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.180
I feel like you've
made me a part of it.

17:51.640 --> 17:55.510
I sent you those audio files of
those documents read onto tape.

17:55.560 --> 17:59.950
Oh good. Now, I need you to
read and record these as well.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.800
~ What?
~ And... these.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.310
And these.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.910
Please?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.550
~ I can't!
~ Well, you have to.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.990
~ I have far too much else to do.
~ Well, then, work faster!

18:13.040 --> 18:15.590
No! Read your own documents.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.550
I'm not sitting up to
3.00am reading aloud

18:18.600 --> 18:20.950
so you can sit back
with your eyes closed.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.910
I can't work like this!
You're a bloody nightmare.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.950
I'm going home to see my family.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.470
I'll see you tomorrow at court.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.620
Don't give me that look!

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
~ How much did you hear?
~ Enough.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.760
You haven't told him, have you?

18:45.680 --> 18:47.200
Uh-uh.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.960
Oh, bumper cars, Hardy!

19:01.000 --> 19:03.270
I think this is brilliant!

19:04.320 --> 19:07.630
Did you not know this was going
to be behind your house?

19:07.680 --> 19:11.710
The rental company forgot to
mention it when I took it on.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.990
Oh, Fred, we could go on
the teacups, couldn't we?

19:15.040 --> 19:17.800
We could take uncle Alec.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.590
Ricky, what are you doing here?

19:25.520 --> 19:27.310
Is this really your gaff?

19:27.360 --> 19:31.510
~ Sorry. Ricky Gillespie.
~ Ellie Miller. We work together.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.700
What are you doing here?

19:35.360 --> 19:37.150
I came to apologise.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.950
When Cate told me you'd been
around, I overreacted.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.470
A long way to come to say that.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.660
I know Ashworth is down
here. You seen him?

19:47.760 --> 19:50.630
~ Tell me where he is.
~ Ricky, that won't help anyone.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.350
It's eating me up knowing
he's back in the country.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.630
You really want to help?
Talk to Miller here.

19:55.680 --> 19:59.040
She's going through the case looking
to see if we've missed anything.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.040
What do you want to know?

20:34.040 --> 20:35.520
(Shh.)

20:43.840 --> 20:46.040
Can't hide from me, mate!

21:03.600 --> 21:06.190
Tell me about your daughter Pippa.

21:06.240 --> 21:09.080
She was my baby girl, you know.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.480
She was sporty.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.030
Good runner.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.750
Played netball for the school team.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.070
Demon at table tennis.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.350
Competitive.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.520
Didn't like losing.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.780
I always spoilt her.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.150
My only child.

21:39.240 --> 21:42.240
What did she want to
be when she grew up?

21:43.640 --> 21:45.440
It kept changing.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.620
The last few months it was er...

21:53.960 --> 21:55.700
.. hairdresser.

21:58.480 --> 22:02.310
The night both girls disappeared,
you were at a wedding with Cate.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.190
You were together all night?

22:04.240 --> 22:06.750
I had to look after
her. She was pissed.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.140
Sign of things to come, 'ey?

22:17.240 --> 22:19.470
And tell me about Lisa.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.320
She was my niece.

22:22.400 --> 22:26.470
Tricky relationship with her dad.
Still uses her mum's surname.

22:26.520 --> 22:30.670
~ She babysat for you quite regularly?
~ Every other week.

22:30.720 --> 22:34.110
Sometimes she'd stay over,
other times I'd take her home.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.800
~ Did she have a boyfriend?
~ No-one regular.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.040
Did you fancy her, Ricky?

22:42.600 --> 22:45.000
She was my niece.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.120
I had to ask.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.440
No, you didn't.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.310
~ You all right?
~ Fine.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.590
How much did you look
into Ricky at the time?

23:04.640 --> 23:06.190
He had a solid alibi.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.670
He and Cate said they were
at the wedding together.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.430
She's changed her story and
the florist confirmed it.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.670
~ Looks like he's lying.
~ Looks that way.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.630
So, who are our suspects?

23:15.680 --> 23:19.790
Got Ashworth, Ricky, Claire,
and that stalker on the estate.

23:19.840 --> 23:23.310
~ Possibly Cate.
~ That's right - don't trust anyone.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.550
You should go. Take Fred. Sleep.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.310
I don't sleep much at the moment,
and I don't like my flat

23:29.360 --> 23:31.830
and I want to take a proper
look at all your files.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.470
Don't get pulled into this.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.710
This case has done enough
damage to people.

23:35.760 --> 23:38.400
Not me. I'm going to solve it.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.740
I'm going to need your wall.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.020
You all right out there?

24:01.560 --> 24:05.640
You going to put your bear to sleep?
She used to have a bear too.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.360
I'm going for a walk.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.760
Leave the key under the thing.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.670
OK.

25:58.800 --> 26:02.070
Oh, for heaven's sake! I need
a lock put on that gate.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.830
You busy?

26:03.880 --> 26:07.380
Of course I'm busy. I'm
in the middle of a trial!

26:07.560 --> 26:08.870
What do you want?

26:08.920 --> 26:11.830
Could you do my will?

26:13.840 --> 26:17.150
Anyone would think I was
a high-street solicitor.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.790
It's not exactly complicated.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.520
So, everything to your daughter.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.640
Held till she is 18. Hm, lucky girl.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.190
~ You got kids?
~ I never married.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.190
That through choice?

26:34.240 --> 26:37.030
What is this, a police interview?

26:37.080 --> 26:39.840
No. Sorry. Just conversation.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.190
Well...

26:45.240 --> 26:49.310
Things were complicated and
I made... I made them more so.

26:49.360 --> 26:54.070
I was at a point when I, when
I should have been strong

26:54.120 --> 26:55.990
and I wasn't,

26:56.040 --> 26:59.160
and I missed the person
I was supposed to be with.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.350
Did you ever tell him?

27:03.360 --> 27:04.790
No.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.590
Maybe you should.

27:06.640 --> 27:10.160
It's always easy to recognise
mistakes in hindsight.

27:12.520 --> 27:14.860
Much harder to fix them now.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.400
Anyway, why do you... why
do you need this now?

27:23.040 --> 27:25.360
Just putting things right.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.990
What's your sense of the trial?

27:29.640 --> 27:32.910
Susan Wright was a mistake
for the defence.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.110
It makes them look like amateurs.

27:35.160 --> 27:39.400
Not going into the witness box is going
to damage Miller's credibility.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.030
He has GOT to be convicted.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.750
I don't need you to tell me that!

27:46.800 --> 27:49.740
I'll do the best I
can with what I have.

27:54.680 --> 27:57.510
Why won't she sleep?
She's had two feeds.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.960
Give her to me, come on. I've
got her. You go back to bed.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.160
That's it.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.350
(That's it, that's it.)

28:07.400 --> 28:10.270
(Shh. I know.)

28:11.640 --> 28:13.910
What are we going to do with you?

28:13.960 --> 28:17.070
You're making all that racket
and waking everyone up.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.720
What are we going to do with you?

28:54.800 --> 28:55.830
Shh!

28:55.880 --> 29:00.150
Did you see this scribbled on the
back of an old vehicle check form?

29:00.200 --> 29:03.550
Thorp Agriservices. What's that?
Have you come across that?

29:03.600 --> 29:07.550
And next to it, Gary Thorp, dash,
Lee Ashworth, question mark.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.790
~ Have you been here all night?
~ Yeah, I suppose I have.

29:10.840 --> 29:14.070
~ Fred is sleeping next door. Shh!
~ I need a cup of tea.

29:14.120 --> 29:17.390
Ah, you're out of teabags and milk

29:17.440 --> 29:20.180
and I've used the last of the bread.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.870
I couldn't find any note
of Thorp Agriservices

29:23.920 --> 29:25.550
ever being cross-checked.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.310
I don't think I've ever heard of it.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.630
I went through that stuff
Lee Ashworth gave you.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.310
It's all useless or irrelevant.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.310
He's just trying to
put us off the scent.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.590
~ How far did you ever look into Lisa Newbery?
~ How do you mean?

29:37.640 --> 29:39.430
The last use of Lisa's bank account

29:39.480 --> 29:41.430
was at 3.54pm on the
day she disappeared

29:41.480 --> 29:43.310
before she went to babysit.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.150
The last call was made at 5.17pm

29:46.200 --> 29:48.470
on her mobile to her mum.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.550
Then no more cash withdrawals
or calls made after that,

29:51.600 --> 29:54.550
but her phone was on
for another 18 hours.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.350
The last signal triangulated
in Portsmouth.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.190
How did her phone get to Portsmouth?

29:59.240 --> 30:01.390
Were any of our suspects
near Portsmouth then?

30:01.440 --> 30:04.040
No, we checked. We know all this.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.070
OK, here's the thing.

30:07.120 --> 30:10.310
Lisa killed Pippa by accident.

30:10.360 --> 30:13.150
Got rid of the body
and went on the run.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.310
She did that and she's still alive.

30:15.360 --> 30:18.300
You've got to admit,
it's a possibility.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.120
You ready? Come on.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.710
You're a prosecution
rebuttal witness.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.960
You are there specifically to
rebut part of the defence case.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.430
Hello, Mr Carter. Was anyone
with you that night?

30:44.480 --> 30:45.510
No.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.070
~ Did anyone see you?
~ No.

30:48.120 --> 30:51.630
So, nobody can
corroborate your story?

30:51.680 --> 30:54.080
Only the pheasants I poached.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.030
Is this funny to you, Mr Carter?

30:58.080 --> 30:59.990
Not at all.

31:00.040 --> 31:04.590
Your own mother identified you
with Danny's body, didn't she?

31:04.640 --> 31:07.670
If I killed Danny, then where
is my DNA on him, 'ey?

31:07.720 --> 31:09.110
Where are my prints at the hut?

31:09.160 --> 31:11.600
Who said you killed him?

31:12.640 --> 31:15.670
I'm not suggesting you killed Danny.

31:15.720 --> 31:19.910
I AM suggesting that you
put his body on the beach

31:19.960 --> 31:22.070
where Susan Wright saw you.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.260
~ Isn't that correct?
~ No!

31:26.720 --> 31:27.790
Thank you.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.180
Mate...

31:52.920 --> 31:54.590
What happened?

31:57.160 --> 31:59.430
Tell me what it was about.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.720
Were there witnesses?

32:06.000 --> 32:10.190
Do they know who did this? Is
someone being punished for this?

32:12.320 --> 32:15.190
Are you getting proper
protection now?

32:17.760 --> 32:19.840
Jonah, say something!

32:28.240 --> 32:32.680
Ever since I was a boy
you said, "I'm your mum."

32:34.200 --> 32:38.000
"Tell me, and I'll
make it all right."

32:41.520 --> 32:44.120
Why can't you get me out of here?

32:58.040 --> 33:01.630
No, it's not your fault.
You did your best.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.950
All right, stop worrying
now. I'll see you tomorrow.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.840
Yeah, bye.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.430
That was Nige. He's er...

33:10.480 --> 33:12.990
He's all torn up about today.

33:13.040 --> 33:16.080
I told him we weren't worried,
so he shouldn't be.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.840
Beth?

33:21.840 --> 33:24.470
I do worry, though.

33:24.520 --> 33:26.590
I worry the jury will believe her.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.240
I worry the truth won't be enough.

34:35.590 --> 34:36.590
What?

34:36.639 --> 34:39.590
Did you tell Ricky Gillespie
where I was working?

34:39.639 --> 34:41.389
No, why?

34:41.440 --> 34:43.639
Because he's come for me.

34:57.240 --> 34:58.840
Here you go.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.470
Oh, shit!

35:05.520 --> 35:08.240
Ricky, get off him! Ricky!

35:15.160 --> 35:17.160
Get off him. Come on!

35:18.480 --> 35:20.820
Do you think that will help?

35:21.840 --> 35:24.070
I got what I came for.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.790
You're nothing!

35:38.200 --> 35:40.350
Are you going to report it?

35:40.400 --> 35:42.400
No, what's the point?

35:43.440 --> 35:45.840
Is this where you're sleeping?

35:47.280 --> 35:49.420
The farmer said I could.

35:50.920 --> 35:52.390
I like it.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.510
I hear you saw Claire.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.360
Did you?

36:01.920 --> 36:04.190
You two ever use Rohypnol?

36:07.760 --> 36:10.520
~ Once.
~ Where did you get it from?

36:11.880 --> 36:13.620
Ricky Gillespie.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.430
He used to go to Amsterdam,

36:16.480 --> 36:19.510
bring back all sorts of stuff.

36:19.560 --> 36:22.360
~ Ricky gave you Rohypnol?
~ He did.

36:23.600 --> 36:27.640
Have you ever heard of a business
called Thorp Agriservices?

36:32.280 --> 36:34.350
No.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.390
You sure about that?

36:36.440 --> 36:40.440
Unless it's one of the businesses
Cate did the books for.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.600
Did you ever sleep with Cate?

36:52.080 --> 36:55.280
~ Bye, Mum!
~ Bye, sweetheart. Have a great day.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.560
No.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.510
The defence want the jury to
believe that I killed Dan.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.750
Got Nige to dispose of the body.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.470
That's clearly where they're going.

37:18.560 --> 37:21.150
I was reading about another family.

37:21.200 --> 37:24.310
They were saying the trial was as
bad as the murder and I thought,

37:24.360 --> 37:26.070
"That can't be right."

37:26.120 --> 37:29.600
Then going in every day, seeing
our lives get turned inside out...

37:31.040 --> 37:33.780
.. when all we did was love our son.

37:34.360 --> 37:35.960
I get it.

37:38.240 --> 37:41.470
You want me to go in the
witness box, don't you?

37:41.520 --> 37:44.150
Honestly? I'm torn.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.750
There's an hour missing
in your account

37:46.800 --> 37:48.270
the night Danny was killed.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.030
You don't need to protect me.

37:50.080 --> 37:54.150
You said yourself somebody needs
to speak up for Dan. Well...

37:54.200 --> 37:57.600
I'm his dad. It should
be down to me, you know.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.350
~ No Mark?
~ No.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.270
They're here.

38:03.320 --> 38:06.190
Yep, they're inside
with the group leader.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.510
Why am I doing this again?

38:09.520 --> 38:10.990
Maybe this is too soon.

38:11.040 --> 38:14.040
No, no, no, I can do
it. I can face them.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.360
What?

39:29.160 --> 39:31.750
Hello. I think you're
in the wrong room.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.150
I'm Tom Miller.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.200
Joe Miller is my dad.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.070
Of course you are. I
didn't recognise you.

39:40.120 --> 39:44.120
~ What are you doing here?
~ Why don't you call me in court?

39:44.400 --> 39:46.540
I want to give evidence.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.840
Good morning.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.270
~ What did you say?!
~ Good morning.

39:55.320 --> 39:59.550
~ Isn't that what people normally say?
~ You talk about being normal...

39:59.600 --> 40:03.880
That's my son! That's what
they've done to him in prison!

40:04.920 --> 40:07.390
Don't you dare make this
my responsibility.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.790
Of course not! Life doesn't
touch you, does it?

40:09.840 --> 40:12.790
~ All right, Sharon.
~ Seven years I took shit from you!

40:12.840 --> 40:14.790
Seven years,

40:14.840 --> 40:18.950
and the one time I ask you for
anything, you don't raise a finger.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.230
Why should I be always
mopping up your mess?

40:21.280 --> 40:23.310
~ What?!
~ All the time you worked for me.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.390
All those 'poor me single
mother' speeches.

40:25.440 --> 40:29.070
Don't put this on me! It's
down to you and no-one else.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.030
What would you know
about being a mother?

40:31.080 --> 40:33.230
You're barely bloody human!

40:33.280 --> 40:36.230
A man died because of your boy.

40:36.280 --> 40:39.990
Yes, he was trying to
help someone in trouble.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.270
Haven't we heard that
defence before(?)

40:42.320 --> 40:44.720
Why didn't you take his case?

40:46.720 --> 40:49.390
Because I didn't like you enough...

40:50.120 --> 40:52.830
.. and I always knew you
would blame me if you lost,

40:52.880 --> 40:55.510
because that's what you always did.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.430
Every time you didn't win,

40:57.480 --> 40:59.830
every time you missed
out on a big brief,

40:59.880 --> 41:02.280
you always blame someone else.

41:03.920 --> 41:07.320
I had such high expectations of you.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.350
You should have stayed
retired, Jocelyn,

41:16.400 --> 41:20.080
because I'm going to see that
you leave that court a failure.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.110
Thorp Agriservices.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.710
I googled it, It's a business in the Sandbrook
area five miles from the Gillespie house.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.350
I need to go back there to
visit this Agriservices place.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.230
I could see where you found Pippa
and the woods by the river.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.110
Fresh eyes - that's what you wanted.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.990
There you are! Don't
you answer your phone?

41:48.040 --> 41:51.990
I've been looking all over for you.
What the hell is all that stuff?

41:52.040 --> 41:54.470
Excuse me. This is my house!

41:54.520 --> 41:55.870
What do you want, Luce?

41:55.920 --> 41:59.350
I just want you to know I
didn't know he'd done it.

41:59.400 --> 42:00.870
Didn't know he'd done what?

42:00.920 --> 42:03.710
Tom is going to give evidence
on behalf of Joe.

42:03.760 --> 42:04.870
What?

42:04.920 --> 42:08.520
He went to see Joe's legal
team without my knowing.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.510
He can't do that without
my permission, can he?

42:11.560 --> 42:12.790
Apparently, he can.

42:12.840 --> 42:15.920
I tried to talk him out of it,
but he's dead set on it, Elle.

42:39.680 --> 42:41.790
So, Lisa's phone in Portsmouth.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.110
What do you do in Portsmouth

42:43.160 --> 42:45.390
apart from being in the
navy or looking at ships?

42:45.440 --> 42:47.590
~ Go on, dazzle me.
~ You get a ferry to France.

42:47.640 --> 42:50.230
~ Portsmouth to Cherbourg.
~ So?

42:50.280 --> 42:53.070
~ So, who else was in France?
~ Lee Ashworth.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.800
Exactly. OK, this is the place.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.910
What is it they do?

43:01.960 --> 43:05.190
Services to the
agricultural industries.

43:05.240 --> 43:08.740
I couldn't find anything
more specific than that.

43:11.640 --> 43:15.080
It doesn't seem like a place Lee
Ashworth would be connected to.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.960
So, what is he not telling us?

43:20.200 --> 43:22.270
It looks pretty closed.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.920
It must have gone out of business.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.310
Let's look round the back.

43:36.440 --> 43:39.750
Are you going to talk to Tom
before he gets in the box?

43:39.800 --> 43:42.200
I don't want to talk about it.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.390
What's that smell?

44:07.080 --> 44:09.000
It's blood!

44:23.720 --> 44:25.520
What is that?!

44:40.920 --> 44:42.990
Oh, look, here you go.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.480
Oh, God. It's a furnace.

45:04.680 --> 45:08.080
Agricultural services - they
burned dead animals here.

45:10.640 --> 45:13.510
You still think Lisa
Newbery is alive?

45:18.320 --> 45:21.270
* And if you take my hand

45:21.320 --> 45:26.190
* Please pull me from the turmoil

45:26.240 --> 45:31.080
* And show me home again

45:34.360 --> 45:38.150
* We'll run side by side

45:38.200 --> 45:43.070
* No secrets left to hide

45:43.120 --> 45:47.040
* Sheltered from the pain *
