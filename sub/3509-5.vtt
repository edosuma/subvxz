WEBVTT

00:00.187 --> 00:01.136
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.193 --> 00:02.793
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.127 --> 00:04.853
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.091 --> 00:06.113
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.514 --> 00:07.114
Who am I?

00:07.203 --> 00:08.342
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.343 --> 00:08.743
Castle.

00:08.777 --> 00:09.437
Castle.

00:09.438 --> 00:11.138
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.192 --> 00:13.382
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:13.592 --> 00:14.411
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:14.658 --> 00:15.925
Beckett.
Aah!

00:16.198 --> 00:18.283
Beckett?
Could you get some backup, please?

00:18.634 --> 00:20.518
<i>And thanks to my friendship</i>
<i>with the Mayor,</i>

00:20.569 --> 00:22.203
<i>I get to be on her case.</i>
Oh!

00:22.237 --> 00:24.806
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.474
<i>And together,</i>
<i>we catch killers.</i>

00:27.022 --> 00:29.924
I hate this case.
I know. Isn't it great?

00:30.446 --> 00:32.046
Ephraim Mankofsky,

00:32.081 --> 00:35.317
or simply Mank,
as he liked to be called,

00:35.351 --> 00:37.185
lived a fruitful life.

00:37.220 --> 00:40.755
A proud father
of ten wonderful children...

00:40.790 --> 00:45.660
Mank was so very,
very blessed.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.097
Ah!

00:51.567 --> 00:54.236
Oh!
Oh.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.037
Who's the shiksa?

00:56.462 --> 00:58.763
I'm thinking
bubblegum fantasy...

00:58.797 --> 01:01.947
Mm-Hmm
or maybe frosted iris.

01:02.047 --> 01:05.015
I'm thinking tickle-the-toe red.
It's my go-to color.

01:06.485 --> 01:07.985
Oh.

01:08.019 --> 01:09.487
You expecting someone?

01:09.488 --> 01:11.828
Gina got promotional freebies
at a new spa

01:11.928 --> 01:14.735
and asked us if we wanted to go
get manis, pedis, and massages.

01:15.065 --> 01:16.498
And <i>you're</i> going?

01:16.533 --> 01:18.134
When it comes to
your ex-wife, darling,

01:18.234 --> 01:20.969
perks outweigh
personal considerations.

01:21.003 --> 01:23.271
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:23.306 --> 01:25.040
You look great.
Well, thank you.

01:26.424 --> 01:28.793
Uh, am I invited?

01:28.805 --> 01:30.706
Uh, no.
It's a girls' day out.

01:30.740 --> 01:33.008
I want to spend time
with Martha and Alexis.

01:33.042 --> 01:34.476
Uh, but I love massages,

01:34.511 --> 01:36.912
and I don't want
the three of you conspiring.

01:36.946 --> 01:37.662
Don't worry, dad.

01:37.762 --> 01:39.462
We've got a lot of other stuff
to talk about.

01:39.562 --> 01:41.864
I want to hear all about
Alexis' new boyfriend

01:41.898 --> 01:43.365
from her point of view.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.953
Did you know
that they have a song?

01:46.053 --> 01:47.112
You have a song?

01:47.213 --> 01:48.947
Yeah. Taylor Swift's "Mine."

01:48.982 --> 01:50.312
It was playing the first time
Ash and I kissed-

01:50.512 --> 01:51.417
La, la, la, la.

01:51.518 --> 01:53.352
I don't want to hear that.

01:53.386 --> 01:55.588
That's why I wanted
those tickets so badly.

01:55.661 --> 01:57.561
Taylor's playing an exclusive
acoustic show on Tuesday,

01:57.596 --> 01:59.764
and I wanted to take Ash,
but it was sold out

01:59.831 --> 02:01.003
before we could get tickets.

02:01.203 --> 02:04.184
Well, have you checked on eBay
or your father's ticket broker?

02:04.452 --> 02:05.886
The only ones available

02:05.920 --> 02:07.821
would've cost Ash and I
six years of allowance...

02:07.855 --> 02:09.222
Ah, well.
Each.

02:09.257 --> 02:11.591
- Mm.
- Do you remember our song?

02:11.626 --> 02:14.261
AC/DC's "You Shook Me
All Night Long."

02:14.295 --> 02:16.414
La, la, la, la.
Don't want to hear it.
Ohh.

02:16.514 --> 02:18.414
You girls have a great day.

02:18.449 --> 02:20.550
Remember, it won't be
the same without me.
No.

02:22.553 --> 02:24.554
Mm.

02:25.723 --> 02:28.391
Mm. Looks like
you have plans anyway.

02:32.957 --> 02:35.061
Don't we usually get to
the victim before the funeral?

02:35.910 --> 02:37.242
What have we got?

02:37.342 --> 02:39.310
Mourners found a body
in the casket.

02:39.344 --> 02:41.245
And that's unusual how?

02:41.279 --> 02:42.980
Well,
the family was bidding

02:43.014 --> 02:44.748
a fond farewell
to Mr. Mank here,

02:44.783 --> 02:46.684
and discovered that he wasn't
going to the grave alone.

02:46.718 --> 02:49.286
Is it just me,
or is Mr. Mank smiling?

02:49.321 --> 02:52.056
Our stowaway
is Dr. Valerie Monroe,

02:52.090 --> 02:55.030
an attending internist
at County Hospital.

02:55.345 --> 02:57.480
A doctor? Any connection
to the deceased?

02:57.573 --> 02:58.879
Ryan's talking
to the family now

02:59.079 --> 02:59.700
Cause of death?

02:59.800 --> 03:02.001
Liver failure.
He drank like a fish.

03:02.036 --> 03:05.822
We may know what killed
Mr. Mank,

03:05.922 --> 03:08.405
but your dead doctor here
is more of a mystery.

03:08.824 --> 03:11.159
No bullet holes, stab wounds
or ligature marks.

03:11.193 --> 03:13.695
She has a perimortem bruise

03:13.729 --> 03:16.031
on the back of her neck here,

03:16.065 --> 03:17.999
but it wasn't severe enough
to have been fatal.

03:18.034 --> 03:19.935
Lividity indicates she died

03:19.969 --> 03:21.870
sometime between
7:00 and 9:00 last night.

03:21.904 --> 03:23.805
But until I can perform
an autopsy,

03:23.839 --> 03:25.086
cause of death is unknown.

03:25.286 --> 03:25.820
Well, what we do know

03:25.920 --> 03:28.060
is that somebody was trying
to get rid of her body.

03:28.153 --> 03:30.136
Along with her purse
and her phone.

03:30.336 --> 03:32.202
You know, it's kind of brilliant
when you think about it--

03:32.376 --> 03:35.177
disappearing a body
in an already occupied coffin.

03:35.212 --> 03:37.146
And because
Jewish tradition demands

03:37.180 --> 03:38.158
that you bury the body
right away,

03:38.258 --> 03:39.332
there's less time
to get caught.

03:39.432 --> 03:41.192
And if it wasn't for
the pallbearers' fumble,

03:41.261 --> 03:43.298
the good doctor would've
disappeared forever.

03:43.398 --> 03:44.532
All right. Talk to
the funeral director.

03:44.632 --> 03:47.753
See if anyone had access to this
coffin in the last 24 hours.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.268
I'm telling you,
I don't know her.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.334
I've never seen her before,

03:51.359 --> 03:54.131
and I have no idea how
her body got in that casket.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.548
This morning when I came in,

03:55.567 --> 03:57.589
I found one of
my back windows smashed.

03:57.689 --> 03:59.176
So you're saying somebody
broke in here

03:59.369 --> 04:00.893
and stashed a body
in one of your coffins?

04:00.974 --> 04:03.375
I called the police,
but since nothing was missing,

04:03.510 --> 04:05.911
you guys didn't bother
showinup. Maybe if you had,

04:05.979 --> 04:08.447
I wouldn't have Mrs. Manks
out for my blood.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.083
So according
to County Hospital,

04:12.117 --> 04:16.224
Dr. Monroe finished her shift
at 6:00 P.M. last night,

04:16.386 --> 04:20.122
which is about an hour or two
before she was murdered,

04:20.156 --> 04:22.224
so hopefully her colleagues
will be able to tell us

04:22.258 --> 04:24.493
where she was headed.

04:25.314 --> 04:26.981
Castle, stop playing
with her phone.

04:27.046 --> 04:28.613
I wasn't playing.

04:28.648 --> 04:30.549
I wasn't. The last
Web searches on her phone

04:30.583 --> 04:32.484
were after
6:00 P.M. yesterday.

04:32.518 --> 04:34.453
She was looking for a hotel
in Katonah, New York.

04:34.487 --> 04:35.798
I thought
it might be relevant.

04:39.093 --> 04:40.727
Oh.

04:40.761 --> 04:42.729
She also has
the new slot car app,

04:42.763 --> 04:46.533
so I'm thinking maybe she has
friends or family in Katonah.

04:46.567 --> 04:48.702
Or perhaps she was planning
a liaison with her lover.

04:48.736 --> 04:49.863
Her boyfriend found out,

04:49.963 --> 04:51.115
and killed her
in a jealous rage.

04:51.215 --> 04:52.398
Yeah, no visible marks
on her body

04:52.499 --> 04:54.834
other than a small bruise
on the back of her neck--

04:54.868 --> 04:56.397
that sounds like
a jealous rage to me.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.470
Castle.

04:58.569 --> 05:00.103
For you.
Oh, yes! Thank you.

05:00.145 --> 05:01.321
Are you
getting mail here now?

05:01.371 --> 05:04.072
Only when I don't want
my daughter to see it.

05:04.107 --> 05:06.167
♪ La ♪

05:06.367 --> 05:07.803
You're a Taylor swift fan?

05:08.168 --> 05:09.089
They're for Alexis.

05:09.189 --> 05:09.789
Oh.

05:09.856 --> 05:12.303
Cost me an arm and a leg,
but Alexis will be thrilled.

05:12.655 --> 05:15.029
Apparently she and Ash
have a song.

05:15.129 --> 05:16.391
Yeah? Well, we have
a song as well.

05:16.772 --> 05:17.973
- We do?
- Mm-Hmm.

05:18.058 --> 05:19.725
"You Talk Too Much"
by Clarence Carter.

05:19.759 --> 05:21.560
Hey. Funeral director's
story checked out.

05:22.687 --> 05:24.889
- Somebody did break in.
- Did you get any foreign prints

05:24.923 --> 05:25.652
on the casket or the window?

05:25.852 --> 05:26.672
Sorry. Struck out.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.655
But we may have
another at bat.

05:28.689 --> 05:30.857
Dr. Monroe's financials,
and I found something unusual.

05:30.891 --> 05:33.626
Almost every morning,
she bought coffee--

05:33.661 --> 05:36.362
a doctor who buys coffee?
Wow. That is unusual.

05:36.397 --> 05:39.832
It is if the coffee shop is
20 blocks from her apartment.

05:41.260 --> 05:42.294
Maybe it's on her way
to work

05:42.394 --> 05:44.389
Nope.
Complete opposite direction.

05:44.396 --> 05:45.897
Boyfriend
in the neighborhood?

05:45.931 --> 05:47.519
On my way to find out.

05:49.454 --> 05:51.255
Great. Now he's mad at me.

05:51.289 --> 05:53.290
Beckett.

05:53.325 --> 05:56.060
I found these on
the victim's clothes and hair--

05:56.094 --> 05:58.029
Gray nylon.

05:58.063 --> 06:00.275
Carpet fibers?

06:00.375 --> 06:02.195
Sent 'em over to the lab

06:02.240 --> 06:03.132
to see if they could
determine the manufacturer.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.421
How about cause of death?

06:04.621 --> 06:07.556
Well, that's where things
get a little interesting.

06:08.954 --> 06:12.590
The bruise on her head
was made with a blunt object.

06:12.624 --> 06:14.558
Mm-Hmm.
May have knocked her out,

06:14.593 --> 06:17.227
but as I suspected,
it's not what killed her.

06:17.262 --> 06:19.930
I found a needle mark
on the side of her neck.

06:19.998 --> 06:21.652
She was injected
with a syringe.

06:22.196 --> 06:23.663
She was poisoned?

06:23.697 --> 06:25.331
Not exactly.

06:25.366 --> 06:29.068
The killer inserted the needle
of an empty syringe

06:29.103 --> 06:31.604
into Dr. Monroe's
carotid artery,

06:31.639 --> 06:33.106
then pushed the plunger,

06:33.140 --> 06:36.609
forcing air directly into
the brain, causing a fatal--

06:36.644 --> 06:38.978
- air embolism.
- Gold star for Castle.

06:39.013 --> 06:41.181
And judging by the skill
of the injection,

06:41.215 --> 06:43.816
I'd say it was done
by a medical professional.

06:43.851 --> 06:45.692
Like one her colleagues
at County Hospital.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.226
Looks like someone gave her
20 cc's of death.

You know,
with the state of health care

07:02.202 --> 07:05.160
and how stressful this can be
for families and for patients,

07:05.246 --> 07:07.214
I'm surprised that
more medical professionals

07:07.248 --> 07:08.281
aren't killed every day.

07:08.381 --> 07:10.006
Yeah, not to mention
the betrayal,

07:10.192 --> 07:12.527
the lust, the bed hopping.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.529
I've watched enough
medical dramas to know

07:14.564 --> 07:17.065
that doctors are notorious
for sleeping with each other.

07:17.099 --> 07:19.668
I bet, as we speak,
in this hospital,

07:19.702 --> 07:22.170
two doctors are
in a break room <i>doing it,</i>

07:22.204 --> 07:24.339
and by "it," I mean--

07:24.373 --> 07:27.342
I know what "it" means, Castle,
and that is just a fantasy.

07:27.376 --> 07:29.177
Four out of five doctors

07:29.211 --> 07:31.061
prefer sleeping with someone
outside of their profession.

07:31.161 --> 07:32.281
Four out of five?

07:32.314 --> 07:32.839
Mm-Hmm.

07:32.939 --> 07:34.059
How many of them
like detectives?

07:34.717 --> 07:36.217
One that I know of.

07:36.252 --> 07:38.219
Whoa. You mean
motorcycle boy is a doctor?

07:38.254 --> 07:41.056
"Man," Castle.
Motorcycle man.

07:41.090 --> 07:42.791
Fine, but he's a doctor?

07:42.825 --> 07:44.526
Yeah, he is.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.094
Huh.

07:46.128 --> 07:48.129
What kind of doctor?
Urologist?

07:48.164 --> 07:49.898
Proctologist?

07:49.932 --> 07:51.900
Don't tell me
he's a gynecologist.

07:51.934 --> 07:52.743
He's a cardiac surgeon.

07:52.843 --> 07:56.246
Oh. A cardiac surgeon.
Wow. That's--

07:56.280 --> 07:57.947
impressive. Yes, it is,

07:57.982 --> 08:01.084
in fact, he did an emergency
bypass on someone this morning,

08:01.118 --> 08:02.585
saved the patient's life.

08:02.620 --> 08:05.455
What'd you do this morning,
Castle?

08:05.489 --> 08:08.324
Made waffles.

08:09.416 --> 08:11.750
A patient could be terminal
and would suddenly just smile

08:11.818 --> 08:14.386
every time Dr. Monroe
walked into a room.

08:14.421 --> 08:16.822
It's a huge, huge loss
for us.

08:16.856 --> 08:18.824
Did she have any family?

08:18.858 --> 08:21.060
Uh, a brother, I think,
in San Diego.

08:21.094 --> 08:22.394
Boyfriend?

08:22.429 --> 08:24.063
Not that she ever mentioned.

08:24.097 --> 08:25.977
She used to always say that
the hospital was her family.

08:26.352 --> 08:28.386
Was there any friction
with any of her colleagues?

08:28.421 --> 08:30.388
Well, yesterday,

08:30.423 --> 08:32.323
just before the end
of her shift,

08:32.357 --> 08:34.692
Dr. Monroe had a private meeting
with one of our nurses.

08:34.727 --> 08:37.062
Is that unusual?

08:37.096 --> 08:39.164
No, but, um, the nurse
came out of the meeting

08:39.198 --> 08:40.832
looking shaken.

08:40.866 --> 08:42.833
I asked Dr. Monroe
about the meeting,

08:42.868 --> 08:45.336
and she said that it was
a personal situation

08:45.371 --> 08:48.073
that she was looking into
and trying to solve.

08:48.107 --> 08:49.841
I'll need to speak
with that nurse.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.409
Nurse McClintock? Of course.

08:51.444 --> 08:53.011
Personal situation
with a nurse--

08:53.045 --> 08:54.579
you thinking
what I'm thinking?

08:54.613 --> 08:56.081
Probably not.

08:56.115 --> 08:57.649
Hospital love triangle.

08:57.683 --> 08:59.651
Check it out--
our dead Dr. Monroe,

08:59.685 --> 09:02.687
she's hot and heavy
with her manly mcdreamy,

09:02.721 --> 09:05.090
until she catches him
in the on-call room

09:05.124 --> 09:07.092
with his scrubs
around his ankles,

09:07.126 --> 09:09.928
shagging
naughty nurse McClintock.

09:09.962 --> 09:11.930
Then the inevitable catfight
ensues

09:11.964 --> 09:14.065
between said nurse
and Dr. Monroe--

09:14.100 --> 09:16.267
a catfight to the death.

09:16.302 --> 09:19.270
Ooh, that's a good title
for something.

09:19.338 --> 09:20.939
"Catfight to the death."

09:20.973 --> 09:23.208
How much TV
do you actually watch?

09:23.242 --> 09:24.321
Enough to know

09:24.377 --> 09:26.498
that this nurse McClintock
will probably be super hot.

09:26.598 --> 09:27.798
Detective.

09:28.047 --> 09:29.576
You wanted to see me.

09:29.676 --> 09:30.515
And you are?

09:30.716 --> 09:33.118
Nurse McClintock.

09:33.152 --> 09:35.120
Care to revise your theory?

09:35.154 --> 09:38.523
Not what I was expecting,
but no, I'll stand by it.

09:38.557 --> 09:40.058
Hey, Greg.

09:40.092 --> 09:42.293
Hey, Dr. Akerman.

09:43.525 --> 09:44.707
So what can I do
for you?

09:44.807 --> 09:46.909
Well, we're here
about Dr. Monroe's murder.

09:47.009 --> 09:48.399
Yeah, it's pretty awful.

09:48.499 --> 09:50.467
We understand that you had
a meeting with her

09:50.501 --> 09:51.975
right before her shift ended
last night.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.083
Yeah. I saw her.

09:54.118 --> 09:56.786
I love the way your hair
frames your face.

09:56.820 --> 09:59.589
Do you always
wear it like that?

09:59.623 --> 10:02.925
Uh, for work, yeah,
but, uh, so about Dr. Monroe?

10:02.960 --> 10:04.393
Hey, Greg.

10:04.428 --> 10:06.162
Hey, Dr. Phelps.

10:06.196 --> 10:09.365
You seem, uh, pretty popular
around here.

10:09.399 --> 10:11.100
Though from what we've heard,

10:11.135 --> 10:13.703
maybe not so much
with Dr. Monroe.

10:13.737 --> 10:16.472
What did you meet with her about
last night?

10:16.507 --> 10:17.940
Nothing, really. It's just,

10:17.975 --> 10:22.071
she thought I was too flirty
with her female residents.

10:22.231 --> 10:23.199
Imagine that.

10:23.299 --> 10:24.419
What's wrong
with being friendly?

10:25.047 --> 10:26.333
So what happened afterwards?

10:26.349 --> 10:28.150
I walked her
to the ambulance dock

10:28.184 --> 10:30.519
and promised to keep
my distance from her residents.

10:30.553 --> 10:32.454
She thanked me,
and then headed off

10:32.488 --> 10:34.389
with some guy
I'd never seen before.

10:34.423 --> 10:36.791
Hmm. So you walked
Dr. Monroe out

10:36.826 --> 10:41.893
and then conveniently saw her
with some mystery man.

10:42.589 --> 10:43.454
That's what happened.

10:43.554 --> 10:44.570
Oh.

10:44.670 --> 10:47.371
Where were you last night
between 7:00 and 9:00?

10:47.406 --> 10:49.473
Are you asking
for my alibi?

10:49.508 --> 10:51.048
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

10:51.052 --> 10:52.242
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

10:52.748 --> 10:54.374
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

10:54.539 --> 10:57.174
Okay. Uh, I was...

10:58.208 --> 10:59.903
Getting coffee with Imani.

11:00.003 --> 11:01.503
I mean, Dr. Phelps.

11:01.538 --> 11:03.005
Uh--
no, wait.

11:03.039 --> 11:04.940
At that time,
I was with Rhonda--

11:04.974 --> 11:07.476
Dr. Chimes.

11:07.510 --> 11:09.212
You can ask her.
She'll verify where I was.

11:09.450 --> 11:11.351
Dr. Rhonda Chimes,
who's smokin' hot, by the way,

11:11.385 --> 11:12.852
confirms his story.

11:12.887 --> 11:15.221
She went on and on about
how Greg's such a great listener

11:15.256 --> 11:18.730
and brings her all these cute
"thinking of you" gifts.

11:18.894 --> 11:21.578
Well, I knew my "homicidal hospital
love triangle" theory had weight.

11:21.678 --> 11:23.278
That makes Greg mcdreamy.

11:23.384 --> 11:25.652
See, that's what I thought,
but Dr. Chimes says

11:25.686 --> 11:27.620
the relationship
was strictly platonic.

11:27.655 --> 11:29.555
So I spoke to more members
of the staff,

11:29.590 --> 11:31.491
and that's when I found
the others.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.059
"The others"?

11:33.093 --> 11:35.295
The other women
in what I call...

11:36.038 --> 11:37.472
The galaxy of Greg.

11:37.498 --> 11:40.678
Each one of these women
orbits Greg

11:40.859 --> 11:43.234
and considers him to be
their special friend.

11:43.315 --> 11:44.809
Well, that totally
makes him mcsteamy.

11:44.850 --> 11:46.751
Nope. Spoke with all
the planets in the galaxy,

11:46.786 --> 11:48.653
and none of them
are sleeping with him.

11:48.687 --> 11:50.555
And C.S.U. did a sweep
of the facility.

11:50.589 --> 11:52.423
None of their carpeting
matches the fibers

11:52.458 --> 11:53.516
they found from the body.

11:53.616 --> 11:55.796
No, makes no sense.
Why spend all that time

11:55.896 --> 11:57.221
listening to women
and buying them things

11:57.321 --> 11:58.630
if you're not gonna try
and sleep with them?

11:59.556 --> 12:00.589
Beckett's here.

12:00.789 --> 12:01.827
Maybe Greg is gay.

12:01.892 --> 12:04.338
With the way he was hitting
on me? No. He's so not gay.

12:04.795 --> 12:06.996
Well, he's working an angle
or he's hiding something.

12:07.031 --> 12:08.765
He's not the only one.

12:08.799 --> 12:10.266
Our victim's student loans.

12:10.301 --> 12:11.801
Since graduating med school,

12:11.835 --> 12:15.171
Dr. Monroe has been regularly
making minimum-amount payments

12:15.205 --> 12:17.610
on her $440,000 student loan.

12:17.710 --> 12:19.368
That's how much it costs
to become a doctor?

12:19.545 --> 12:20.456
Glad I became a cop.

12:20.556 --> 12:22.894
And without any increase
in pay at the hospital,

12:23.459 --> 12:26.141
6 months ago, she started
paying $10,000 a week.

12:26.317 --> 12:28.017
40 grand a month?

12:28.052 --> 12:30.053
Any idea where the money
was coming from?

12:30.087 --> 12:32.122
Not from a bank account.
From money orders.

12:32.156 --> 12:34.224
So someone was making
the payments on her behalf.
Mm-Hmm.

12:34.258 --> 12:36.025
Just got a fax
from hospital security.

12:36.060 --> 12:38.461
They got this off
the ambulance dock camera.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.930
Your boy Greg was telling
the truth. Dr. Monroe did

12:40.965 --> 12:42.429
head out with another guy.
Security showed

12:42.529 --> 12:44.034
this photo around,
but no one recognized him.

12:44.134 --> 12:45.513
Well, whoever this man is,
he might have been

12:45.613 --> 12:47.602
the last one to see
Dr. Monroe alive.

12:47.702 --> 12:48.942
Especially if he killed her.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:00.222 --> 13:01.821
I'm home,
and guess what I've--

13:01.921 --> 13:04.049
Dad, Gina got tickets
for Taylor Swift!
What?

13:04.279 --> 13:06.561
They're front row, center,
and come with backstage passes.

13:06.634 --> 13:07.847
We're going to meet her.

13:08.047 --> 13:09.002
That's great.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.990
We just made a deal
for her autobiography.

13:12.025 --> 13:12.614
It's no big deal.

13:12.714 --> 13:14.848
I gotta call Ash.
He's gonna be so excited.

13:21.337 --> 13:23.272
I can't believe
you did that.

13:23.306 --> 13:24.940
What?

13:24.974 --> 13:25.889
I got tickets.

13:26.257 --> 13:28.825
I mean, you didn't even call me
to ask me if it was okay?

13:28.860 --> 13:30.601
I didn't imagine
that you would disapprove,

13:30.701 --> 13:32.060
and Alexis was delighted.

13:32.160 --> 13:32.945
No, that's not the point.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.847
No, it's not. The point is
that I was trying

13:35.881 --> 13:37.782
to do something nice
for Alexis.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.218
And apparently,
all you can see is that I...

13:40.252 --> 13:43.120
Stole your hero moment.

13:43.121 --> 13:43.221
That's not--

13:44.426 --> 13:46.527
Good night.

13:49.130 --> 13:50.788
Any luck
on the mystery guy?

13:50.988 --> 13:52.190
No, sir. Nothing yet.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.076
Listen, go on home. You can
start fresh in the morning.

13:54.276 --> 13:54.902
Uh, no--

13:54.903 --> 13:55.520
I wouldn't leave just yet.

13:55.620 --> 13:56.168
Where you been?

13:56.268 --> 13:57.765
- Getting coffee.
- All day?

13:57.781 --> 13:59.515
At Dr. Monroe's coffee shop.

13:59.549 --> 14:02.117
Turns out it's right next to
the Faircross Hotel.

14:02.152 --> 14:04.010
I showed the manager
Dr. Monroe's picture.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.196
And?

14:05.315 --> 14:06.916
Pay dirt.
Several nights a week...

14:07.003 --> 14:08.690
Our victim was
spending the night in a suite

14:08.790 --> 14:11.574
belonging to a permanent
resident--one Cesar Calderon.

14:11.575 --> 14:12.530
The drug lord?

14:12.531 --> 14:13.244
Mm-Hmm.

14:13.448 --> 14:15.230
They call him <i>el diablo,</i>
the devil.

14:15.537 --> 14:17.037
They say Calderon
was responsible

14:17.071 --> 14:18.672
for half the coke
on the streets in the '80s,

14:18.772 --> 14:20.073
but he was so big,
no one could touch him.

14:20.273 --> 14:21.580
So what was
our Saint of a doctor

14:21.675 --> 14:23.291
doing spending the night
with a drug lord?

14:23.391 --> 14:25.441
Nightly visits,
mystery cash gifts--

14:25.541 --> 14:27.975
sounds like Valerie Monroe
was the devil's mistress.

14:32.857 --> 14:36.006
A known criminal
living in a swanky hotel.

14:36.189 --> 14:38.390
Very Al Capone.

14:39.617 --> 14:40.918
A murdered mistress,

14:40.919 --> 14:42.786
a <i>brutal</i>
Columbian drug lord--

14:42.854 --> 14:45.189
what do you think,
revenge from a rival cartel,

14:45.223 --> 14:46.790
a drug deal gone wrong?

14:46.825 --> 14:49.493
Maybe murder is simply
Calderon's way of saying

14:49.527 --> 14:50.333
"I'm just not that into you."

14:50.433 --> 14:51.362
I don't know. An air embolism

14:51.463 --> 14:53.530
doesn't exactly strike me
like a drug lord's M.O.

14:53.565 --> 14:54.865
Unless...

14:54.899 --> 14:56.734
Calderon did that on purpose

14:56.768 --> 14:58.635
to throw suspicion
towards the hospital staff

14:58.670 --> 15:00.571
on the off chance
the body was found.

15:00.605 --> 15:03.474
The thing I don't get
is how a respected doctor

15:03.508 --> 15:06.210
could literally get into bed
with a known drug lord.

15:06.244 --> 15:08.449
Ah, ladies love the bad boys.

15:08.549 --> 15:09.179
Mm.

15:09.180 --> 15:12.449
Cesar <i>"el diablo"</i> Calderon...
Ultimate bad boy.

15:13.134 --> 15:16.403
I mean, who knows what kind
of twisted, depraved,

15:16.438 --> 15:19.039
unholy world
we're about to step into.

15:19.074 --> 15:22.343
Sir,
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

15:22.377 --> 15:23.790
This is Richard Castle.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.891
We need to speak
with Cesar Calderon.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.427
I'm sorry. I think
you have the wrong room.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.995
I don't know anyone named--

15:30.029 --> 15:33.065
Richard Castle?
<i>The</i> Richard Castle?

15:33.099 --> 15:36.134
Let them come, Manolo.
Let 'em in.

15:43.492 --> 15:46.027
Welcome. Welcome.

15:46.061 --> 15:48.696
Mr. Calderon,
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

15:48.731 --> 15:53.301
Pleasure. And you, sir,
need no introduction.

15:53.335 --> 15:56.738
I am a huge admirer
of your fictions.

15:56.772 --> 16:00.608
Whenever I desire a taste
of my old, grittier life,

16:00.643 --> 16:02.910
I call upon your works.

16:02.945 --> 16:05.146
My favorite
is Nikki Fuego.

16:05.180 --> 16:07.382
Nikki Fue--
oh, you mean Nikki Heat.

16:07.416 --> 16:09.684
No, I mean Nikki Fuego.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.653
I only read
the Spanish translations.

16:11.687 --> 16:13.888
Have you read
your novels in Spanish?

16:13.922 --> 16:15.690
No.

16:15.724 --> 16:19.560
Oh, you should.
Everything is better in Spanish.

16:19.595 --> 16:20.862
Please.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.330
Thank you.

16:22.364 --> 16:23.865
Thank you.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.201
So...

16:27.236 --> 16:30.138
A best-selling novelist

16:30.172 --> 16:32.540
and a... gorgeous Detective

16:32.574 --> 16:35.543
have come to pay me a visit.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.278
Why?

16:38.564 --> 16:39.831
We're investigating
a murder.

16:39.864 --> 16:42.466
Ah. How exciting.
Who's the victim?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.436
Dr. Valerie Monroe.

16:45.470 --> 16:50.107
Valerie Monroe? No.

16:50.141 --> 16:51.809
Valerie is dead?

16:52.904 --> 16:55.339
What was your relationship
with Dr. Monroe?

16:55.373 --> 16:58.442
She, uh...

16:58.476 --> 17:01.445
She was my, uh...

17:03.114 --> 17:06.349
My... private physician.

17:06.384 --> 17:09.752
I have a bad heart.

17:09.787 --> 17:13.056
Six months ago,
I had a heart attack.

17:13.090 --> 17:15.291
My...

17:15.326 --> 17:19.463
My brother Manuel
took me to the hospital.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.031
Valerie was there, and...

17:22.066 --> 17:24.968
She took care of me.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.174
I offered her a position

17:30.209 --> 17:31.843
as my concierge...

17:32.737 --> 17:34.438
Physician.

17:34.472 --> 17:36.640
Two nights a week,

17:36.675 --> 17:38.709
my brother is my caregiver.

17:38.743 --> 17:42.346
The other five--Valerie.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.315
That explains the money.

17:44.349 --> 17:46.517
So she was
just your doctor?

17:46.551 --> 17:48.252
No, she was my--

17:48.286 --> 17:50.120
my miracle worker.

17:51.162 --> 17:54.798
She gave me back
my strength.

17:54.832 --> 17:56.800
Valerie...

17:56.834 --> 17:59.269
Forced me back into the world.

17:59.303 --> 18:02.472
She made me
walk beside her.

18:02.506 --> 18:07.010
At night, sometimes we would
drive in to the park.

18:09.580 --> 18:12.582
Whoever did this evil
must be punished.

18:12.617 --> 18:16.186
We intend to do just that,
Mr. Calderon.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.089
Where were you between
7:00 and 9:00 last night?

18:19.123 --> 18:23.026
I was right here.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.995
I ordered room service.

18:25.029 --> 18:28.598
The hotel staff
can attest to that.

18:28.633 --> 18:30.333
The carpet's brown, not gray.

18:30.368 --> 18:32.636
She wasn't killed here.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.237
Do you recognize
this man?

18:43.968 --> 18:45.836
No.

18:45.870 --> 18:47.105
Is he the one
who killed her?

18:47.169 --> 18:50.372
All we know is that he was
with her just before she died.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.637
I've seen this man before.

18:54.283 --> 18:56.051
A few times,

18:56.085 --> 18:58.141
Valerie had me drop her off
at a diner by her place.

18:58.990 --> 19:00.924
This man
was sometimes waiting.

19:00.958 --> 19:03.727
Do you remember
the name of the diner?

19:06.597 --> 19:08.532
The waitstaff said
he's a lunch regular,

19:08.566 --> 19:10.500
but he hasn't
been in yet today.

19:10.535 --> 19:11.197
They don't know his name.

19:11.297 --> 19:13.901
Ah. Maybe he killed Dr. Monroe
and then got outta dodge.

19:14.305 --> 19:16.506
Maybe. Let's just
wait here, though.

19:16.541 --> 19:18.008
Calderon's alibi?

19:18.042 --> 19:20.043
The hotel staff
confirmed it.

19:21.546 --> 19:23.446
How'd Alexis' surprise go?

19:23.481 --> 19:25.415
Turns out,
surprise was on me.

19:25.449 --> 19:27.918
Gina got her tickets, too--
front row,

19:27.952 --> 19:29.352
backstage access.

19:29.387 --> 19:31.321
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

19:31.355 --> 19:34.257
Well, she should've checked
with me first.
Maybe.

19:34.292 --> 19:38.195
But at least it means, she cared
enough to do it, right?

19:41.592 --> 19:43.259
There he is.

19:43.294 --> 19:44.237
Excuse me, sir.

19:44.636 --> 19:47.171
NYPD. We need
to ask you a few questions

19:47.205 --> 19:48.839
about Dr. Valerie Monroe.

19:49.674 --> 19:52.310
You want talk about Valerie,
call my office.

19:52.344 --> 19:53.878
If you don't cooperate,

19:53.939 --> 19:55.679
I'm gonna be forced
to arrest you.

19:56.074 --> 19:58.509
Hey, drop it!

19:58.543 --> 20:00.177
No, you drop it.

20:00.212 --> 20:03.614
Leonard Maloney,
Attorney General's office.

20:03.648 --> 20:05.416
What the hell's going on?

20:05.450 --> 20:08.852
We're investigating
the murder of Dr. Monroe.

20:08.887 --> 20:10.588
Murder? Valerie's dead?

20:10.622 --> 20:12.423
Exactly how did you know her?

20:12.457 --> 20:15.292
She was working for me...

20:15.327 --> 20:17.461
Undercover.

20:20.624 --> 20:22.295
It's like
an Alfred Hitchcock movie--

20:22.794 --> 20:23.596
a beautiful professional

20:23.696 --> 20:26.441
goes undercover
to trap an infamous drug lord.

20:26.442 --> 20:27.196
Drug lord?

20:27.199 --> 20:30.538
Cesar caldron--the target
of your investigation.

20:30.823 --> 20:33.158
Calderon? No.

20:33.676 --> 20:36.378
The investigation of Calderon's
way above my pay grade.

20:36.412 --> 20:38.037
Besides, he's been out
of the drug game for years.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.320
Then what was your target?

20:39.536 --> 20:42.105
County Hospital.
The state comptroller

20:42.139 --> 20:44.040
was investigating
misappropriations of funds,

20:44.074 --> 20:46.142
prescription fraud,
and equipment theft.

20:46.176 --> 20:47.057
Medical fraud?

20:47.257 --> 20:48.462
And we couldn't find
the source,

20:48.538 --> 20:50.639
so, uh, I asked Dr. Monroe

20:50.674 --> 20:53.008
to be our eyes and ears
on the inside.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.610
And did she find anything?

20:54.644 --> 20:57.279
No. And then, uh,
the day before yesterday,

20:57.314 --> 20:59.515
she calls me out of the blue
and wants to meet.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.884
By the ambulance dock.

21:01.918 --> 21:04.153
When I got there, she said
she was on to something

21:04.187 --> 21:06.922
that involved prescription fraud
and a possible smuggling ring.

21:06.956 --> 21:09.525
But, uh, she didn't want
to point fingers

21:09.559 --> 21:11.827
until she had verified some
things up North this weekend.

21:11.861 --> 21:13.529
Up North?

21:13.563 --> 21:16.231
The searches on Dr. Monroe's
phone--Katonah, New York.

21:16.826 --> 21:17.865
What
does a smuggling ring

21:17.953 --> 21:19.323
have to do with Katonah?

21:19.523 --> 21:20.771
It's basically a nothing town.

21:21.105 --> 21:23.409
Three reasons
why Katonah is awesome--

21:23.620 --> 21:26.155
one, gorgeous countrysides,
two, it's where

21:26.190 --> 21:28.424
"Doonesbury" cartoonist
Garry Trudeau went to school,

21:28.459 --> 21:30.359
and three, and perhaps
most importantly...

21:30.394 --> 21:32.235
It's where
Martha Stewart lives.

21:32.435 --> 21:33.635
You like Martha Stewart?

21:34.305 --> 21:35.091
Doesn't everyone?

21:35.291 --> 21:36.306
Yeah, I-I liked her,

21:36.307 --> 21:38.442
until she went to prison
for insider trading.

21:38.476 --> 21:41.678
Wait a minute. Prison. Next to
Katonah is Bedford Hills.

21:41.713 --> 21:44.014
And what's in Bedford Hills,
Detective?

21:44.048 --> 21:45.615
There's a women's prison.

21:45.650 --> 21:47.399
Do you think
she suspected someone there?

21:47.599 --> 21:48.226
If we're talking about

21:48.326 --> 21:49.824
a field trip to
a women's prison, I'm in.

21:50.024 --> 21:52.423
Easy, tiger.
Listen, call the prison,

21:52.523 --> 21:55.058
have 'em fax over the visitor's
log for the past six months

21:55.092 --> 21:56.559
and an inmate list.

21:56.594 --> 21:58.034
See if anyone there connects
to the hospital or our victim.

21:58.042 --> 21:59.189
Okay.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.712
Uh, if we're talking about
wading through

22:01.746 --> 22:03.613
hospital staff lists
and prison logs, I'm out.

22:03.648 --> 22:06.717
Besides... I've got
some amends to make,

22:06.751 --> 22:10.253
and it's gonna take
a little bribery.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.155
Okay, Rick.
I'm here.

22:12.190 --> 22:14.591
What's so important?

22:20.533 --> 22:22.119
What is this?

22:22.219 --> 22:23.550
Well, nothing says...

22:24.975 --> 22:25.679
"I'm an ass"

22:25.779 --> 22:28.047
like a bunch
of helium-filled rubber.

22:32.152 --> 22:34.220
And you're not smiling.

22:34.254 --> 22:35.722
No.

22:35.756 --> 22:37.323
It's just, uh...

22:37.358 --> 22:40.259
That I had this sick feeling
all day.

22:40.294 --> 22:42.829
I felt like we had
had this fight before,

22:42.863 --> 22:44.998
and then I remembered
the doll debacle.

22:45.032 --> 22:47.633
You bought a doll
for Alexis for Christmas.

22:47.668 --> 22:49.135
And you already had one

22:49.169 --> 22:51.137
stashed away in the closet
as a surprise.

22:51.171 --> 22:54.540
And it was a battle deciding
which one she would keep.

22:54.575 --> 22:56.542
And you won, like always.

22:56.577 --> 22:58.878
But yours was so creepy.
Its eyes followed you.

22:58.912 --> 23:01.698
This is exactly
what I'm talking about, Rick.

23:02.433 --> 23:05.779
Even when we were married,
you built a wall around Alexis,

23:05.879 --> 23:08.089
like you didn't want
anyone else to be close to her.

23:08.782 --> 23:10.140
When it came
to the two of you,

23:10.313 --> 23:13.088
I was on the outside,
looking in.

23:14.105 --> 23:15.939
I just...

23:15.973 --> 23:17.829
I don't want to feel
like an outsider anymore.

23:20.044 --> 23:22.846
She's growing up.

23:22.880 --> 23:26.116
She has a boyfriend now.

23:27.652 --> 23:31.054
You want to know the truth?

23:31.088 --> 23:33.323
I feel like
an outsider, too.

23:36.928 --> 23:39.529
But you're very right.

23:39.563 --> 23:41.431
And I was wrong.

23:41.465 --> 23:44.968
And you should be
the hero this time.

23:52.935 --> 23:54.836
That's sweet.

23:54.870 --> 23:57.805
You're sweet.

24:10.319 --> 24:12.720
<i>Hello.</i>
Yeah.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.528
So how did it go with
the amends last night?

24:14.590 --> 24:15.929
Did bribery work?

24:16.019 --> 24:18.213
That and sincerity.

24:18.413 --> 24:19.648
Well, it's always
a good combination.

24:19.156 --> 24:21.524
Mm-Hmm. How goes
the haystack? Any needles?

24:21.558 --> 24:23.025
More like a pitchfork.

24:23.060 --> 24:25.761
There's no record of Dr. Monroe
ever visiting the prison,

24:25.796 --> 24:27.230
<i>but</i> the logs do show

24:27.264 --> 24:29.732
that another member of
the hospital staff was making

24:29.766 --> 24:32.169
weekly visits to
Bedford Hills prison facility.

24:32.369 --> 24:33.553
Anyone we know?

24:33.554 --> 24:35.022
Oh, yeah.

24:35.056 --> 24:37.557
Nurse Greg, seriously?

24:37.592 --> 24:39.393
Seriously.
For the past three years,

24:39.427 --> 24:41.194
Greg has been making
weekly visits

24:41.229 --> 24:43.897
to an inmate named Amy Porter,
who is doing 30 years to life

24:43.931 --> 24:45.866
for her role
as a getaway driver

24:45.900 --> 24:48.402
in a failed robbery where
a security guard was killed.

24:49.336 --> 24:50.180
So I did a little bit
of digging,

24:50.280 --> 24:53.182
and apparently, Greg was her
character witness at her trial.

24:53.282 --> 24:54.493
Amy is Greg's girlfriend.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.294
Mm-Hmm.

24:55.367 --> 24:56.325
Dr. Monroe was on to

24:56.425 --> 24:58.827
prescription fraud
and a smuggling ring.

24:58.861 --> 25:01.563
She thought Greg was
stealing meds from the hospital

25:01.597 --> 25:02.711
and smuggling them into Amy.

25:02.811 --> 25:04.329
For her to distribute
on the inside.

25:04.429 --> 25:06.397
So I was right.
Greg was working an angle.

25:06.431 --> 25:08.833
He was friends with all these
women so they would help him.

25:08.867 --> 25:10.801
Probably without
any of them realizing it,

25:10.836 --> 25:14.105
so I asked the prison warden
to go and search Amy's cell

25:14.139 --> 25:15.514
and then bring her down here
for questioning.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.432
Yo. I just got off the phone

25:17.532 --> 25:18.677
with the warden
from Bedford Hills.

25:18.777 --> 25:21.312
Amy Porter suffered a stroke
this morning.

25:21.346 --> 25:22.801
At 25?

25:22.901 --> 25:23.986
They sent her
to County Hospital.

25:24.086 --> 25:28.033
Here? Why not bring her
to a hospital

25:26.054 --> 25:26.836
a little closer to the prison?

25:27.036 --> 25:28.236
Well, county is
the nearest hospital

25:28.333 --> 25:28.870
with a secured Ward.

25:28.970 --> 25:31.184
And that's also
where Greg works.

25:33.303 --> 25:35.271
Dr. Phelps.
Dr. Phelps, we understand

25:35.405 --> 25:37.373
that you're treating
a patient named Amy Porter.

25:37.407 --> 25:39.141
She's a prison transfer.

25:39.175 --> 25:42.444
I was. Unfortunately, she died
while having an M.R.I.

25:42.479 --> 25:44.713
She's dead?
Where's the body?

25:52.288 --> 25:53.856
Greg switched the body.

25:53.890 --> 25:56.358
This wasn't about smuggling
something into jail.

25:56.393 --> 25:58.761
It was about smuggling
something out. Oh!

25:58.795 --> 26:01.663
Greg pulled a prison break.

26:04.161 --> 26:05.910
- A prison break?
- Yes, sir.

26:06.530 --> 26:08.679
We swept the hospital, but we
didn't find either of them.

26:08.879 --> 26:10.960
Turns out Greg isn't
mcdreamy or mcsteamy.

26:11.049 --> 26:13.584
- He's mcschemey.
- Do we know how he pulled this off?

26:13.618 --> 26:15.025
Well, sir, after reviewing
the evidence,

26:15.099 --> 26:16.833
and also with
Dr. Parish's expertise,

26:16.867 --> 26:18.835
we think
that we figured it out.

26:18.869 --> 26:22.338
The key was forging friendships
with specific doctors

26:22.373 --> 26:24.440
who could provide
documents and drugs.

26:24.475 --> 26:27.310
That's why he was just friends
and not sleeping with them all.

26:27.344 --> 26:29.305
He was committed to Amy
the whole time.

26:29.480 --> 26:32.352
Without knowing it, every woman
in the galaxy of Greg

26:32.422 --> 26:34.390
helped him
with his escape plan--

26:34.424 --> 26:36.225
signatures
on death certificates,

26:36.259 --> 26:38.260
medical orders, body releases.

26:38.294 --> 26:40.729
O-okay, but how did he
fake Amy's death?

26:40.764 --> 26:43.799
Pharmacist Lissa Akerman
gave Greg a container

26:43.833 --> 26:46.682
of acetyl hexapeptide-3.

26:46.782 --> 26:49.350
It's a botox-like
topical cream,

26:49.384 --> 26:50.851
effective in small doses.

26:50.886 --> 26:53.354
Akerman thought it was
a gift for Greg's mother,

26:53.388 --> 26:55.089
but Greg instead
smuggled it into Amy.

26:55.123 --> 26:58.537
Amy lathered half her face with
it, temporarily diminishing

26:58.637 --> 27:00.252
her facial muscles' ability
to contract.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.302
Simulating a stroke.

27:01.314 --> 27:04.536
And then according
to prison protocol, Amy was sent to county

27:04.656 --> 27:07.926
to receive advanced medical treatment.
And like any good physician,

27:08.046 --> 27:10.985
<i>Dr. Phelps immediately ordered an M.R.I.</i>

27:11.105 --> 27:13.053
Kicking Greg's plan
into high gear.

27:13.173 --> 27:17.468
Greg used his connections at the E.R.
to get both morphine and naloxone.

27:17.588 --> 27:19.895
When he escorted Amy
into the MR.I.,

27:20.015 --> 27:23.046
he gave her enough morphine
to cause her vital signs to drop

27:23.166 --> 27:24.914
to where she had
no recordable pulse.

27:25.034 --> 27:27.141
Creating the illusion of death,

27:27.261 --> 27:30.250
and since Amy had
a do-not-resuscitate order...

27:30.291 --> 27:33.019
- Uh, courtesy of Dr. Zha...
- She was pronounced dead.

27:33.064 --> 27:36.238
Not wanting to waste a second,
Greg wheels Amy into the morgue.

27:36.358 --> 27:38.211
And then injects her
with the naloxone,

27:38.331 --> 27:41.392
- bringing her out of the O.D.
- Very "Pulp Fiction."

27:41.512 --> 27:43.265
And very dangerous,
but effective.

27:43.316 --> 27:44.892
Greg had the morgue supervisor

27:45.012 --> 27:47.884
sign all of the documents
necessary to release the body,

27:47.944 --> 27:51.042
and then placed
Jane Doe's body in Amy's bag.

27:51.162 --> 27:53.153
Then like
any other couple in love,

27:53.273 --> 27:56.290
they walked arm in arm out of the hospital
and into the sunrise...

27:56.758 --> 27:58.781
Risking everything for love.

27:58.901 --> 28:01.454
If it weren't for the fact that
Dr. Monroe was killed... - Mm.

28:01.574 --> 28:03.574
- It'd be a pretty romantic story.
- Hold on now.

28:03.636 --> 28:05.419
I thought Greg had a solid alibi
for her murder.

28:05.539 --> 28:08.445
Well, sir, we think that an accomplice
was helping him out.

28:08.565 --> 28:10.010
So we're looking in
to known associates,

28:10.130 --> 28:12.528
and we've also got a team out
at Greg's apartment

28:12.648 --> 28:14.217
looking to see
if they can find any leads.

28:14.337 --> 28:15.934
We're also monitoring
his credit cards,

28:16.054 --> 28:17.844
and we've issued A.P.B.s
for the tristate area,

28:17.891 --> 28:19.115
but given all of the planning,

28:19.235 --> 28:21.491
they probably already had
an escape route planned.

28:22.178 --> 28:26.750
- But if we're lucky, we'll catch a break.
- I think we just did.

28:27.726 --> 28:29.283
Greg's letters to Amy.

28:29.403 --> 28:32.466
If they've been planning this for a long
time, there's gotta be a clue in the letters.

28:32.586 --> 28:33.648
Call the crew over at Greg's.

28:33.768 --> 28:35.814
If we can find Amy's letters to Greg,
then we'll have a full set.

28:35.934 --> 28:36.940
Yes, sir.

28:38.111 --> 28:41.423
These are just love notes.
There's nothing in here about the escape.

28:41.543 --> 28:45.074
Well, then we have to look
at these like a romance novel,
not a murder mystery.

28:45.194 --> 28:47.719
These people are baring
their souls in these letters,

28:47.839 --> 28:50.029
and if we're lucky,
we'll find our zihuatenjo.

28:52.057 --> 28:53.949
In "The Shawshank Redemption,"
Andy was trying...

28:54.069 --> 28:57.850
No, I know what it is.
I'm a cop. I've seen the movie.

28:58.736 --> 29:00.840
It's just, there's nothing
about that in here.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.457
The only thing that Amy talks
about is being innocent

29:03.577 --> 29:06.439
of the crime she was convicted of
and how much she misses Greg.

29:06.473 --> 29:08.280
Yeah, it's pretty clear Greg
misses her, too.

29:08.321 --> 29:11.010
Listen to this. "The days
without you grow longer,

29:11.130 --> 29:14.513
- but my love for you grows"...
- Stronger?

29:14.548 --> 29:15.715
"Harder."

29:16.448 --> 29:17.583
A poet he's not.

29:17.617 --> 29:20.453
Yeah, well, not everyone is
a best-selling crime novelist.

29:20.487 --> 29:22.934
And it doesn't mean that
their love was any less.

29:22.979 --> 29:24.690
Listen to what
she wrote to him.

29:25.395 --> 29:27.629
"I can't bear
to see you suffer.

29:27.749 --> 29:30.478
"Make a new life with someone else.
Just be happy.

29:30.842 --> 29:32.821
If anyone deserves it,
it's you."

29:32.941 --> 29:35.205
I think I have
his response to that.

29:37.191 --> 29:39.719
"I don't believe in much,
but I believe in us."

29:39.839 --> 29:40.951
- I like this guy.
- Mm-hmm.

29:41.071 --> 29:43.778
"And no matter the obstacles,
no matter how hard you try,

29:43.898 --> 29:46.430
you'll never get rid of me.
I love you."

29:50.895 --> 29:53.644
You're right.
These are worthless.

29:56.584 --> 30:01.420
Uh, so two lovers reunite
after three years.

30:02.164 --> 30:04.672
- Where would you go?
- A motel.

30:05.956 --> 30:08.475
Really?
That's what you call "special"?

30:09.729 --> 30:12.219
Well, I'm assuming
they're on a budget.

30:13.009 --> 30:14.392
All right, where's
the first place you'd go?

30:14.444 --> 30:16.068
I don't know.
Someplace romantic.

30:16.125 --> 30:18.061
Someplace with
special meaning maybe.

30:18.967 --> 30:20.804
Like the first place they met?

30:23.558 --> 30:25.372
Yeah. "I'll never forget

30:25.492 --> 30:27.961
"the first time I laid eyes
on you that cold, rainy night

30:28.081 --> 30:31.418
inside the Burgeropolis in Hillsdale."

30:31.763 --> 30:32.966
Hillsdale, New Jersey.

30:33.497 --> 30:34.623
Burgeropolis?

30:35.129 --> 30:36.592
You think that's their special place?

30:39.578 --> 30:42.237
Yeah. No, that's...
That's stupid.

30:43.601 --> 30:45.492
Maybe we'll get lucky
with the A.P.B.s.

30:48.591 --> 30:49.869
Well, let me know.

30:50.279 --> 30:54.711
Ugh. Nothing from airports,
bus or train stations.

30:54.767 --> 30:56.315
There's no
credit card activity.

30:56.343 --> 30:57.714
Apparently Greg pulled
all of his money

30:57.834 --> 30:59.866
out of his bank account
a week ago.

30:59.986 --> 31:02.793
$8,000. That's more than enough
money to get out of the country.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.298
They're probably
halfway to Canada by now.

31:04.418 --> 31:06.228
Well, we sent their photos
to border patrol,

31:06.250 --> 31:08.245
so if they try to leave,
we'll catch 'em.

31:08.365 --> 31:10.341
Unless they're hidden in the trunk
of their buddy's car.

31:10.461 --> 31:13.208
Lab I.D.'ed those carpet fibers
from Dr. Monroe's body.

31:13.328 --> 31:15.021
They're from the lining
of a car trunk,

31:15.141 --> 31:17.814
a Deville, manufactured
within the last five years.

31:18.067 --> 31:20.599
Well, that's probably how the accomplice
got the body to the funeral home.

31:20.719 --> 31:23.862
All right. Check into surveillance cameras
within the vicinity of the funeral home.

31:23.982 --> 31:26.903
Maybe we'll get lucky, get a license plate,
and track down that accomplice.

31:26.937 --> 31:30.136
Or you could just ask Greg
who his accomplice is. - Sir?

31:30.537 --> 31:33.309
Those Jersey state troopers
you had staking out the Burgeropolis

31:33.344 --> 31:35.578
just pulled your fugitive love
birds from the drive-thru,

31:35.613 --> 31:36.682
and they're bringing 'em in now.

31:37.076 --> 31:39.623
You had Jersey troopers
stake out the Burgeropolis?

31:39.663 --> 31:42.361
- Yeah.
- But you said that was stupid.

31:42.481 --> 31:44.555
No, you said it was stupid,

31:44.675 --> 31:46.071
and it looks like
you were wrong.

31:46.353 --> 31:48.393
No. No, no, I was right.

31:48.513 --> 31:49.476
I love her.

31:49.986 --> 31:53.643
What was I supposed to do,
leave her in that prison to rot?

31:54.213 --> 31:55.254
What would you have done?

31:55.422 --> 31:57.898
The love of your life
stuck behind bars

31:57.948 --> 31:59.483
for a crime she didn't commit--

31:59.514 --> 32:01.431
That's not what this is about,
Mr. McClintock.

32:01.471 --> 32:04.919
Yes, it is. Amy didn't drive
the getaway car in that robbery.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.190
Her car was stolen.
She got screwed by the s--

32:07.310 --> 32:08.850
Get focused, Greg.

32:08.970 --> 32:11.593
We're not interested
in your girlfriend's crimes.

32:11.713 --> 32:14.660
We're here because of
Dr. Monroe's murder.

32:15.008 --> 32:16.063
What?

32:17.160 --> 32:18.460
I have an alibi, remember?

32:18.580 --> 32:19.775
We know you have an alibi.

32:19.895 --> 32:22.520
We also know that you have
an accomplice.

32:22.686 --> 32:24.232
I don't have an accomplice.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.137
I don't know anything
about her murder.

32:26.257 --> 32:28.951
Right. And Dr. Monroe really
pulled you into that meeting

32:29.007 --> 32:31.198
to scold you for flirting
with her residents.

32:31.660 --> 32:34.418
She was on to you.
She knew about the drugs,

32:34.752 --> 32:37.803
she knew about the plan,
she knew about Bedford Hills,

32:37.832 --> 32:38.948
and that's why
you had her killed.

32:39.068 --> 32:42.473
No. When she pulled me
into her office,

32:42.593 --> 32:43.874
I knew she was on to me.

32:43.994 --> 32:45.871
I had to move fast before
she ruined everything.

32:46.139 --> 32:48.455
- So you killed her.
- No, I didn't kill...

32:49.158 --> 32:52.015
All I did was change
the date of Amy's escape.

32:52.135 --> 32:54.988
I had to get her out before
Dr. Monroe found out everything.

32:55.108 --> 32:56.640
Or maybe she already
knew everything.

32:57.048 --> 32:58.652
Maybe she threatened
to turn you in.

32:58.772 --> 33:02.081
No. From her questions,
I could tell she was fishing,

33:02.201 --> 33:03.513
trying to put
the pieces together.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.859
She was off shift for
the next two days,

33:05.979 --> 33:08.785
so I figured if I could distract her
and get the hell out of her office,

33:08.819 --> 33:11.803
- our plan might still have a chance.
- What do you mean, you distracted her?

33:11.923 --> 33:13.308
You know, change the subject.

33:13.428 --> 33:16.645
I started asking her about
this new bracelet she had,

33:16.765 --> 33:18.944
how it was a special gift
from her boyfriend.

33:19.064 --> 33:22.165
Then a few minutes later, her phone
rang, and I got the hell outta there.

33:22.759 --> 33:24.574
- Well, that's a pretty good story.
- Mm.

33:25.083 --> 33:27.728
Only Dr. Monroe
didn't have a boyfriend.

33:27.848 --> 33:30.357
No, I swear. The way she was
talking about that bracelet,

33:30.403 --> 33:32.074
she definitely had a boyfriend.

33:32.835 --> 33:37.505
In this whole investigation, there has
not been one mention of a boyfriend.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.306
Probably because he was lying.
Look.

33:39.426 --> 33:42.572
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
See? No bracelet.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.629
Nearby bank cam
caught a photo of a Deville

33:45.667 --> 33:47.379
heading towards the direction
of our funeral home

33:47.415 --> 33:48.974
shortly after our window
for time of death.

33:49.094 --> 33:50.329
It was the only one that passed by
that night.

33:50.449 --> 33:53.084
Well, is there a better angle so we could
see the license plate or the driver?

33:53.204 --> 33:54.812
Nope. That's the best one.

33:55.107 --> 33:57.940
Oh, look. He wasn't lying.

33:58.510 --> 34:00.338
She was wearing a bracelet
right before she was killed.

34:01.231 --> 34:02.314
Well, where did it go?

34:02.434 --> 34:04.762
C.S.U.s didn't find one
in the coffin or anywhere else.

34:04.882 --> 34:06.389
- The killer took it.
- Why?

34:06.509 --> 34:08.359
I mean, it doesn't look like
it was worth very much.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.281
And if it was about money, how
come he didn't take her purse?

34:10.400 --> 34:11.955
Because it wasn't about money.
It was about passion.

34:12.074 --> 34:13.784
Do you recognize that bracelet?

34:18.463 --> 34:20.404
I've seen that design before.

34:23.989 --> 34:26.737
Detective, Mr. Castle,

34:27.159 --> 34:29.931
have you made any progress
finding Valerie's killer?

34:30.052 --> 34:31.500
We believe we have.

34:31.620 --> 34:35.637
Tell me, what was the exact nature
of your relationship with Dr. Monroe?

34:35.757 --> 34:37.687
I told you already.
She was my physician.

34:37.806 --> 34:40.617
You said that before, but I'm confused.
You see, unlike you,

34:41.243 --> 34:44.598
I don't take long, romantic drives with
my doctor. I do that with my girlfriend.

34:44.943 --> 34:49.360
We don't yet live in a world where
passion is a crime, do we, Detective?

34:49.481 --> 34:53.606
No, but crimes of passion are,
especially murder.

34:53.992 --> 34:56.370
That's a lovely necklace
you're wearing, Mr. Calderon.

34:56.489 --> 34:57.361
May I?
Yeah.

34:57.395 --> 35:00.479
I couldn't help but notice,
it bears a similar design

35:00.599 --> 35:03.334
to the bracelet that Valerie was wearing
the night she was killed.

35:05.745 --> 35:10.289
That's because I gave it to her
as a token of my affection.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.522
It belonged to my mother.

35:12.642 --> 35:14.305
This belonged to my father.

35:15.009 --> 35:16.401
They're a set.

35:16.521 --> 35:18.132
Well, considering it's
an heirloom,

35:18.374 --> 35:19.616
no wonder you wanted it back.

35:20.086 --> 35:21.633
I don't know what you mean.

35:21.753 --> 35:24.154
It wasn't on her body
when she was found.

35:24.274 --> 35:25.666
Someone removed it.

35:25.786 --> 35:29.042
What happened?
Did she reject you?

35:29.745 --> 35:32.116
Is that when
the old Calderon returned--

35:32.396 --> 35:36.804
not the, uh, cognac swirling renaissance
man we see before us,

35:37.000 --> 35:38.323
but the ruthless killer?

35:38.358 --> 35:39.791
Be careful, Mr. Castle.

35:39.826 --> 35:43.092
This is not one of your fictions
where people bleed ink.

35:43.396 --> 35:47.594
I loved her, yes.
But I did not kill her.

35:47.714 --> 35:49.177
I was here.

35:49.219 --> 35:51.714
And you're wealthy enough
to have bought that alibi.

35:51.834 --> 35:53.245
This is outrageous.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.060
I will not be slandered.

35:55.095 --> 35:57.555
It is not slander
if there is proof.

35:57.601 --> 36:00.246
This is a photo
from an A.T.M. camera

36:00.697 --> 36:05.024
the night that she was killed, about a
block and a half away from the funeral home

36:05.144 --> 36:06.842
where her body was dumped.

36:06.962 --> 36:08.488
That's your car,
Mr. Calderon.

36:08.882 --> 36:12.096
The same one you and Valerie used
to take your long, romantic drives.

36:12.216 --> 36:14.361
No, no, you're mistaken..

36:14.412 --> 36:16.890
Save it, Calderon. We found
nylon fibers on her body--

36:17.143 --> 36:17.929
Gray,

36:18.395 --> 36:21.380
just like the color of the carpet
on the back of your Deville.

36:21.419 --> 36:23.054
So what was her body doing

36:23.174 --> 36:26.009
- stuffed in the trunk of your car?
- I was here. I...

36:27.333 --> 36:29.556
I-I remember the...

36:31.682 --> 36:34.264
I was here.

36:35.136 --> 36:36.641
But you...

36:38.621 --> 36:40.421
You took the keys that night.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.314
<i>Madre de dios.</i>

36:46.958 --> 36:49.379
Oh, it was you.

36:49.897 --> 36:53.752
I can see it in your eyes,
Manolo. It was you.

36:53.872 --> 36:55.452
<i>You don't understand,
hermano.</i>

36:56.449 --> 36:59.199
I had to.
I did it for you.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.550
- Why?!
- She was an informant, Cesar.

37:01.670 --> 37:03.776
When I saw her
with that man at the diner,

37:04.353 --> 37:05.662
I followed him.

37:06.406 --> 37:07.916
And you know what I found?

37:08.690 --> 37:10.547
He worked
for the Attorney General.

37:10.667 --> 37:11.988
She betrayed you.

37:12.108 --> 37:13.972
Why didn't you come to me?

37:14.022 --> 37:16.310
Because you were
too blinded, brother.

37:18.554 --> 37:20.538
And when you gave her
mother's bracelet,

37:20.658 --> 37:23.480
I knew it was up to me to keep
Valerie from hurting you.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.900
What did you do, Manolo?

37:26.223 --> 37:28.981
He hit her
in the head, knocked her out.

37:29.919 --> 37:31.652
And then using
the syringe skills

37:31.679 --> 37:34.475
he developed caring for you,
he injected her with air.

37:34.595 --> 37:36.711
Leaving no blood evidence.

37:37.401 --> 37:42.707
And then he stuffed her body into someone
else's coffin so that you would never know.

37:43.981 --> 37:46.133
How could you do this?

37:46.752 --> 37:48.679
I made them disappear...

37:50.199 --> 37:52.084
<i>Just like you taught me, hermano.</i>

37:53.630 --> 37:54.854
No body...

37:56.036 --> 37:57.204
No murder.

37:58.006 --> 38:02.474
Manuel Calderon, you're under arrest
for the murder of Dr. Valerie Monroe.

38:03.819 --> 38:05.328
I couldn't let her hurt you.

38:05.448 --> 38:07.930
The fact is, she wasn't going to.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.097
She wasn't investigating
your brother.

38:10.459 --> 38:12.936
She was looking into corruption
at County Hospital.

38:13.056 --> 38:14.498
You killed her for nothing.

38:15.297 --> 38:16.398
Let's go.

38:29.774 --> 38:31.730
You know,
that nurse Greg fellow?

38:32.081 --> 38:33.446
He impresses me.

38:33.566 --> 38:35.883
You know, someone willing
to risk it all

38:35.918 --> 38:38.024
to break his lover
out of the big house.

38:38.144 --> 38:41.055
We should all
have that in our lives.

38:41.915 --> 38:43.458
Yeah, we should.

38:46.154 --> 38:47.730
Hey! You're home.

38:47.850 --> 38:48.926
How was it?

38:49.046 --> 38:50.733
Taylor was amazing.

38:50.853 --> 38:54.602
Ash and I held hands while she sang
our song. It was so great.

38:56.641 --> 38:58.118
Thank you so much.

38:58.354 --> 38:59.441
For what?

38:59.561 --> 39:00.552
It's okay.

39:00.992 --> 39:03.791
Gina told me. The tickets
were from both of you.

39:05.569 --> 39:06.614
Good night.

39:09.098 --> 39:11.925
Very considerate of Gina.

39:12.530 --> 39:14.049
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

39:14.322 --> 39:15.330
Mm-hmm.

39:16.774 --> 39:18.083
You're starting to like her,
aren't you?

39:18.203 --> 39:21.018
I stopped being emotionally invested
in your girlfriends after you dumped

39:21.138 --> 39:23.869
that darling Lizzie
in eleventh grade.

39:24.032 --> 39:25.466
Gina's very nice.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.318
She's a little over the top,
but, you know...

39:27.438 --> 39:29.808
You're happy, I'm happy.

39:30.463 --> 39:33.811
But... the question is this,

39:33.931 --> 39:35.642
when you come right down to it,

39:36.288 --> 39:38.694
would you be willing
to break her out of prison?

39:39.637 --> 39:41.283
Because that, my boy,

39:41.902 --> 39:43.182
is true love.

39:53.268 --> 39:54.914
Oh, God.
I love you so much.

39:55.561 --> 39:56.884
I love you, too.

39:58.940 --> 40:01.528
I can't stand the thought of you
getting locked up over me.

40:01.859 --> 40:04.138
Well, you might not have to.

40:05.291 --> 40:08.024
After hearing all your,
uh, claims of innocence,

40:08.144 --> 40:10.767
we decided to go over
your arrest file.

40:10.887 --> 40:12.838
Turns out, there were
a lot of discrepancies.

40:12.958 --> 40:16.659
So we sent the files to Leonard Maloney
over at the Attorney General's office,

40:16.779 --> 40:18.152
and he agreed.

40:18.186 --> 40:21.328
Apparently your public
defender was a real hack.

40:21.448 --> 40:23.438
He overlooked several
key pieces of evidence.

40:23.558 --> 40:27.303
Including a statement that was ignored
because of the eyewitness' mental illness,

40:27.423 --> 40:30.811
so Maloney has agreed
to reopen your case,

40:30.931 --> 40:33.287
and he believes that you have
cause to be hopeful.

40:33.407 --> 40:34.601
Oh.

40:36.565 --> 40:38.134
What about Greg?

40:38.190 --> 40:42.614
Well, in the spirit of justice, Maloney
has said that if you get exonerated,

40:42.734 --> 40:44.752
he will recommend
that Greg gets probation.

40:46.700 --> 40:48.519
W-why are you doing all this?

40:48.639 --> 40:50.615
Because someone convinced me

40:50.645 --> 40:52.251
that a love story
as good as yours

40:52.371 --> 40:54.277
deserves a shot
at a happy ending.

41:01.492 --> 41:02.786
Oh.

41:03.553 --> 41:04.310
Um...

41:04.761 --> 41:08.194
We feel bad
that the state troopers
picked you up at Burgeropolis

41:08.217 --> 41:10.226
before you were able to relive
your first date.

41:10.983 --> 41:12.606
So until you do get out...

41:14.027 --> 41:15.265
We brought you this.

41:18.332 --> 41:20.998
I, uh, told 'em
to hold the onions.

41:28.868 --> 41:30.769
That was a nice thing
you guys did in there.

41:31.330 --> 41:35.240
Well, I just thought that after everything
Greg did for her, they deserved a chance.

41:35.810 --> 41:38.109
Besides, if it were
you and I in Amy's shoes,

41:38.144 --> 41:42.091
- we'd still be rotting in prison.
- Speak for yourself, bro. I'd escape.

41:42.211 --> 41:44.282
- What, you'd just leave me in there?
- It's the law of the jungle.

41:44.316 --> 41:46.792
- I gotta look out for numero uno.
- Wow.

41:47.319 --> 41:50.444
Nothing like a hypothetical prison term
to let you know who your friends really are.

41:50.564 --> 41:52.524
Don't worry, Castle.
I'd get you out.

41:52.861 --> 41:56.237

41:56.357 --> 41:59.121
♪ I'll see you walk in again ♪

41:59.241 --> 42:01.973

- Yeah.
