00:02.262 --> 00:04.003
<i>Everyone had gathered,
because today</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:06.660
<i>was Carla's first day back
since she had the baby.</i>

00:06.704 --> 00:10.154
She's coming! This is not a drill,
repeat. This is not a drill.

00:10.529 --> 00:12.680
Remember, one group says
"Welcome", one group says "back",

00:12.871 --> 00:15.037
one group says "Carla".
Ok, get ready, let's go!

00:18.449 --> 00:19.075
Elliot?

00:19.075 --> 00:22.641
Fine, it was a drill. But I
just want us to be ready.

00:22.953 --> 00:24.204
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

00:24.239 --> 00:25.288
Hey everyone!

00:25.412 --> 00:26.606
Okay, let's have it.

00:26.752 --> 00:28.770
Back, Carla, back!

00:28.912 --> 00:30.042
Dammit, people!

00:30.042 --> 00:32.372
- It's ok, baby.
- No, it's not ok!

00:32.531 --> 00:34.104
One more time, go!

00:34.238 --> 00:35.277
Hey, everyone.

00:35.515 --> 00:37.825
Welcome Back, Carckle...

00:37.949 --> 00:39.482
Who the hell came up with "pickle"?!

00:39.549 --> 00:41.795
I did. If you call Carla pickle,

00:41.841 --> 00:45.613
I can call Isabella "Little Gurken".
I need this.

00:45.903 --> 00:46.700
Done.

00:47.501 --> 00:49.687
Actually babe, I'm just
heading back home.

00:49.687 --> 00:53.239
It turned out my maternity lead
doesn't end until next week.

00:53.759 --> 00:56.054
Ooh, pickle, I'm sorry.

00:56.955 --> 00:59.625
What is all this fuss about
nurse Turkleton returning?

00:59.655 --> 01:01.425
She's only been gone six days.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.768
She's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo.
But wait, before I make you look

01:04.769 --> 01:08.275
like a complete idiot, we'd all like
to thank you for setting up the new

01:08.275 --> 01:10.479
employee discount of
copydump.

01:10.575 --> 01:11.150
Gang!

01:11.748 --> 01:13.646
- Cheers!
- Pickle!

01:14.144 --> 01:16.748
Stop, if it had taken any effort
I wouldn't have done it.

01:16.854 --> 01:18.831
And I mean that.
I really do.

01:18.931 --> 01:22.288
And back to insulting you,
she's been gone 6 weeks, Bobo,

01:22.361 --> 01:26.612
the 6 days that you're referring to are
the 6 days you actually worked this month.

01:27.356 --> 01:31.593
<i>Dr. Cox was right. This year Dr. Kelso
had gotten a little lazy.</i>

01:32.010 --> 01:34.500
<i>There was the way he
handled requests.</i>

01:37.722 --> 01:39.986
Thanks. I'm working to it.

01:40.486 --> 01:43.705
<i>Or how he found a way to eliminate
any facetime with the patients.</i>

01:43.795 --> 01:46.172
<i>Welcome to Sacred Heart, Mr...</i>

01:46.553 --> 01:47.491
Hartly.

01:47.702 --> 01:50.230

dr. Bob Kelso.</i>

01:50.557 --> 01:52.397
<i>I see you're here for a...</i>

01:52.622 --> 01:53.573
Vasectomy.

01:53.756 --> 01:55.653
<i>Enjoy your stay.</i>

01:56.124 --> 01:59.037
<i>Ted, you have not to forget the tape.</i>

01:59.423 --> 02:01.316
How does he always know?

02:04.274 --> 02:07.161
<i>He didn't even bothered to
learn the new interns' names.</i>

02:07.161 --> 02:10.610
Listen up, faces. In order to
save us all some time,

02:10.610 --> 02:13.698
I will call all the males "Daves"
and all the females "Debbies".

02:14.142 --> 02:15.613
Debbie is actually my name.

02:15.913 --> 02:19.366
Then our reference is to the others,
you will be Slugathor.

02:19.817 --> 02:23.003
Daves, Debbies, Slugathor...
I will be in my office.

02:23.125 --> 02:25.776
If you need anything, feel
free to bother Dorian.

02:26.525 --> 02:29.162
<i>I always wondered what he
did in his office all day.</i>

02:30.435 --> 02:35.999
Human Magic 8 Ball, tell me
if I should play golf this weekend.

02:40.241 --> 02:45.101
- I'm a lawyer!
- I said, should I play golf?

02:48.576 --> 02:50.522
Ask again later.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.856
Why would I say that?

02:55.528 --> 02:57.773
My daydreams are crazy.

02:58.884 --> 03:00.453
Oooh...dizzy.

<i>Since Elliot bought a house,
I had to look for a place to live.</i>

03:21.067 --> 03:24.038
<i>Time to get out of my
head and into an apartment.</i>

03:24.205 --> 03:25.342
Hey, Dr.Kelso.

03:26.766 --> 03:28.961
<i>I actually don't mind

<i>Dr. Reid.</i>

03:44.027 --> 03:47.785
<i>Ever since she quit the hospital for private

<i>Skittle-a-dee, skittle-a-doo!</i>

03:54.228 --> 03:55.171
Dr. Kelso.

03:55.270 --> 03:57.217
<i>What if this isnt',
Nurse Buzzkiller.</i>

03:57.374 --> 04:00.519
- Good morning, nurse Roberts.
- Carla's gone, another week.

04:00.684 --> 04:02.379
We need a substitute Head Nurse.

04:02.528 --> 04:06.862
Laverne, from now on if you need
something just take care of it yourself.

04:07.109 --> 04:08.537
In fact, all of you
should hear this.

04:08.740 --> 04:13.132
I believe that it was Robin Zender, of "Chip
Trick", who said "I want you to want me",

04:13.185 --> 04:16.865
well if I sang that song it would go
"I don't want you to want me".

04:18.438 --> 04:20.471
<i>Skittle-a-dee, skittle-a-doo!</i>

04:21.538 --> 04:24.655

<i>Brian Dancer has high dull suffer, so
ok, turn on the down-home, crapulon.</i>

04:35.298 --> 04:39.128
Hey there, young. Hella.
Holla. Bob Kelso here.

04:39.434 --> 04:43.492
I understand that since you're headwound,
you have some short term memory loss.

04:44.211 --> 04:45.129
Headwound?

04:46.240 --> 04:48.435
No, I'm just kidding, Doctor.

04:51.009 --> 04:55.008
Ah, see, now I'm embarrassed
because that wound's real.

04:55.567 --> 04:56.931
That doesn't matter, son.

04:57.031 --> 04:58.995
<i>Bob Kelso, write it
down, dammit!</i>

04:59.282 --> 05:01.390
So, I see you're in the Service.

05:01.390 --> 05:03.575
Yessir, Private Brian Dancer.

05:03.437 --> 05:07.777
Private Dancer? Tough name.
Must had your share of big dance.

05:08.141 --> 05:12.478
- How d'you hurt your noggin?
- An I.E.D. got our transport vehicle,

05:12.478 --> 05:17.335
I accidentally left a couple of chunks
of my skull in Baghdad.

05:17.888 --> 05:21.764
<i>Iraq! You know how controversial that
topic is, Bob, quick, change the subject.</i>

05:22.048 --> 05:25.365
So, Pluto's not a planet anymore,
what's up with that?

05:25.824 --> 05:30.900
<i>Well played, Bobby. Lord knows you've
seen this hot bottom topics before.</i>

05:31.022 --> 05:33.851
Oh, please Laverne.
Global warming?

05:33.851 --> 05:37.960
Here's an inconvenient truth
for you. Nobody cares.

05:40.791 --> 05:44.299
So you think it's OK to
just kill animals for sport?

05:44.656 --> 05:46.813
If it serves or use for purpose,
yes I do.

05:47.855 --> 05:48.384
Salt?

05:51.002 --> 05:52.336
Crack black pepper?

05:55.046 --> 05:56.489
Thank you, Bingo.

05:59.429 --> 06:01.639
Well, I'll check on you later, son.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.862
<i>Yep, Iraq is just the type of devicing subject,</i>

06:04.978 --> 06:08.599
<i>that would spread around this
damn hospital like wildfire.</i>

06:08.813 --> 06:13.055
Poor kid, said he's blown
off...all for nothing.

06:13.637 --> 06:19.017
All for nothing? My nephew Lance is over there
fighting to give those people democracy.

06:19.410 --> 06:24.373
Ooh, so that's why we're over there.
Here I thought it was a rude act of terrorism, or

06:24.505 --> 06:28.899
was it for the oil? Or for mama Hussein
secret Falafel rest I've been ashklashf...

06:28.900 --> 06:30.777
Gosh, that hard to keep track.

06:33.056 --> 06:34.779
Dude, I hear they have laws
that make women

06:34.843 --> 06:37.201
completely cover their
bodies, when around in public.

06:37.241 --> 06:40.704
The war in I-raq? Try the war
to C-rack. [the bra sustaining part]

06:42.042 --> 06:45.711
Do you get it, Turk? All the
terrorists want to do is kill you.

06:45.811 --> 06:48.036
They want to kill you.

06:48.036 --> 06:49.885
- Elliot, if you...
- Kill you!

06:50.097 --> 06:53.983
You guys, in case I find an apartment I like...
I need someone to write a reference for me.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.604
J.D., we're in the middle of something.

06:56.187 --> 06:58.778
Elliot, the only good that's come
from our occupation of Iraq

06:58.779 --> 07:01.792
is exposing the neo-conservative
conspiracy to prepatch with the american

07:01.793 --> 07:05.983
- cultural/economical imperialism!
- What do you think, JD?

07:06.396 --> 07:07.802
Can you excuse me a second?!

07:08.652 --> 07:10.513
Did you bring her back in
stubbing a newspapers?

07:10.514 --> 07:13.106
Carla is making me normally up when
I go near things after the funnies.

07:13.106 --> 07:15.077
Oh, of course the funnies!
The funnies don't count,

07:15.078 --> 07:16.634
by the way dream what would i do today?

07:17.086 --> 07:20.348
Can you believe your pizza
delivery guy outbowl is a tip?

07:20.383 --> 07:23.085
No, but that's what's going about momma
dookie is always sticking on his feet.

07:23.086 --> 07:25.110
- I think you mean "pause".
- No!

07:25.720 --> 07:26.613
-Shh!
- Shh! Sorry!

07:26.614 --> 07:27.306
- Let's keep it real.
- Jeez.

07:27.690 --> 07:31.216
- Well, JD...the war?
- I don't have time for this, Elliot.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.433
I have to find an apartment.

07:33.408 --> 07:37.217
If you get the chance, read the Boone
Docks. Man, that little kid hates hunkies!

07:37.218 --> 07:38.747
Ha ha! Who doesn't?!

07:39.667 --> 07:42.798
Typical Dorian. Running away from an
argument you know nothing about.

07:42.799 --> 07:45.685
- I know all about the war.
- Really?

07:47.748 --> 07:48.667
Point to Iraq.

07:49.423 --> 07:51.710
Why do you keep a globe
on your janitor cart?

07:51.711 --> 07:54.613
Guess i get lost. I'll give you a hand.
It's not the countryship like a boot.

07:56.244 --> 07:56.947
That's Iraq.

07:57.378 --> 07:59.131
- That's China.
- You're China.

08:02.020 --> 08:03.692
Some rageous accusation.

08:06.628 --> 08:09.726
Need salt. Where's my bunny? Bingo?

08:12.271 --> 08:18.441
So, this is a picture of my unit after we
secured the bridge outside of...of Fallujah.

08:19.002 --> 08:21.697
And...oh, here's my unit
when we're playing poker.

08:22.266 --> 08:23.797
And...wheew...uhm...

08:24.830 --> 08:26.657
This is a...picture of my unit.

08:28.172 --> 08:31.206
I was gonna send it to my girlfriend
but...she broke up with me.

08:31.874 --> 08:34.778
Well, send it to her anyway...she
should know what she's missing.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.118
Sir?

08:36.423 --> 08:38.216
<i>I like this kid. He gets me.</i>

08:39.106 --> 08:44.065
No, i was in the Navy. It's important to
remember the good men that you serve with.

08:44.893 --> 08:48.391
That's why i carry around a a little
reminder of my buddy Johhny.

08:49.053 --> 08:50.933
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.105
Fantastic!

08:54.270 --> 08:58.902
And Johhny got a tattoo on the same
cheek that says "Bobby".

08:59.455 --> 09:01.484
He probably doesn't regret that at all

09:01.713 --> 09:05.360
No, you just can't find that
kind of bond in civilian life.

09:06.466 --> 09:10.096
Although I've often wondered what my life
would be like if I'd stayed in the Service.

09:15.371 --> 09:23.254
<i>* "Up Where we Belong" from "An officer
and a gentleman" in Vietnamian *</i>

09:23.255 --> 09:31.934

09:32.688 --> 09:35.602
I would have asked to be
stationed in South East Asia...

09:36.513 --> 09:37.871
...for the food.

09:38.303 --> 09:42.077
You goin' crap wise all you lots. But all the
boys over there are doing the Lord's will.

09:42.079 --> 09:44.494
And when you say Lord you
mean Halliburton, right?

09:45.553 --> 09:48.842
Ok, who here thinks democracy
is worth fighting for?

09:48.843 --> 09:50.128
- Me! - I do!
- Yeah! - Oh yeah!

09:50.334 --> 09:54.051
Who here thinks we were manupulated by
false claims of WMDs ?

09:54.052 --> 09:55.910
- We're here!
- We do! - Me!

09:55.945 --> 09:58.504
Neat. Everyone's sitting
on the appropriate side.

09:59.435 --> 10:04.898
- Ted, what do you think?
- I think both sides have valid points.

10:04.899 --> 10:06.883
Why d'you take a stand, Swept Balls?

10:08.256 --> 10:11.310
Oh, you liberals survey and every
american agrees with you,

10:11.311 --> 10:14.474
that's why Jonh Kerry and
Al Gore built one in landslides.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.584
Oh, my God. Elliot, you're
one of them, aren't you?

10:21.116 --> 10:27.535
You know what? I don't need to be ashamed
of this, anymore. Yes, I'm a Republican.

10:28.515 --> 10:31.123
- Me too!
- Me too.

10:31.777 --> 10:32.437
Elliot!

10:34.251 --> 10:35.505
Me too.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.447
President Reagan? Should
be on or under Bob Dole?

10:43.448 --> 10:44.400
How about another time?

10:46.053 --> 10:48.734
- WHat do you think about Hillary?
- I hate that bitch.

11:08.737 --> 11:11.604
a Mild's fever, but I don't know who to
talk to, beacuse everyone's arguing.

11:11.639 --> 11:14.159
Sluggy, if you want to get people's attention

11:14.194 --> 11:17.602
you've got to be more aggressive
or more attractive, pick one.

are the one that we are here to protect.</i>

11:40.747 --> 11:42.431
Good morning Private Dancer

11:44.232 --> 11:44.540
Son?!

11:48.483 --> 11:51.958
Get respiratory for a blood-gas
and set up for a lombar puncture!

11:58.382 --> 11:59.520
He's stable.

12:00.896 --> 12:01.854
Whose fault is this?

12:02.274 --> 12:05.668
<i>* Turk, Elliot and Cox exculpating *</i>

12:05.808 --> 12:08.159
<i>They need a leader Bob, give them one.</i>

12:09.075 --> 12:10.238
That's enough!

12:11.376 --> 12:13.330
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!

12:14.344 --> 12:16.546
Just a second on the yelling there Bob

12:16.645 --> 12:20.480
Do you think you can actually be an
absentee chief of medicine and still matter?

12:21.098 --> 12:23.152
Let me see if I can make this real clear for you.

12:23.188 --> 12:27.342
If this hospital were a human
body, you'd be the appendix

12:27.343 --> 12:29.900
because at one time you served some function,

12:29.914 --> 12:33.907
but it was so long ago, nobody is
quite sure what that was...anymore.

12:35.574 --> 12:37.849
'Xcuse us, we're gonna
talk it out over here.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.378
<i>Well, you've got what you asked for, Bob.</i>

12:46.502 --> 12:47.876
<i>They don't need you.</i>

12:51.204 --> 12:52.034
Hey, son.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.503
How're you doing?

12:55.803 --> 12:58.674
Well, even though non one ever comes

12:58.709 --> 13:01.698
everytime I hit this nurse's
button, I feel a little better.

13:02.061 --> 13:03.032
That's morphine.

13:03.689 --> 13:04.670
That explains it.

13:05.639 --> 13:08.091
Hey, uhm, thanks for checkin' in on me.

13:08.851 --> 13:11.528
You're all like my Sergeant.

13:11.793 --> 13:12.906
Sergeant Bourne.

13:14.252 --> 13:18.588
He was hands-on, too. Always
trying to be in the game.

13:20.410 --> 13:22.915
<i>That's how you get people around
you to listen to you, Bob.</i>

13:23.063 --> 13:25.717
<i>Be like this kid's Sergeant,
and get back in the game.</i>

13:26.204 --> 13:29.538
<i>Right after you follow that coop cake,
if she'd put it down for even a second</i>

13:29.539 --> 13:32.435
<i>it's yours! No! Now, dammit!</i>

13:33.111 --> 13:33.765
Hey, buddy,

13:33.766 --> 13:35.049
<i>You've found an apartment yet?</i>

13:35.084 --> 13:39.245
No, man, i feel like an idiot so i've been
reading up on this whole Iraq war situation.

13:39.445 --> 13:42.699
You know what's so messed up? I just
got to the power President Bush

13:42.700 --> 13:44.843
gave his "mission accomplished"
speech on a battleship,

13:44.844 --> 13:45.844
and i still got 400 more pages to go.

13:48.485 --> 13:49.644
Hey, uhm, i gotta go.

13:50.629 --> 13:51.675
All right, listen up people.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.471
I am here to roll at my sleeves

13:54.506 --> 13:57.585
and put an end to all this nonsense
so that we can go back to work.

13:58.611 --> 14:02.756
We are working. You see, even though
we currently despise each other,

14:02.791 --> 14:04.712
we're professionals. For example,

14:05.362 --> 14:09.351
I can lend Barbie a hand
despite the fact that she is a heartless

14:09.351 --> 14:12.719
"red state" supporting , NRA backing
and illegal immigrant hating

14:12.719 --> 14:17.487
self-righteous missing form dope
essentially Karl Rove with smaller boobs.

14:18.140 --> 14:20.579
And I can help out Dr. Cox,
even though he got a punch

14:20.580 --> 14:22.743
demming his piss on the government
until Jabar's cropped

14:22.744 --> 14:26.198
this team a condo of anthrax,
and PR listening out frankly face.

14:27.629 --> 14:30.508
You know if you're really serious about
helping out I can use a hand of my

14:30.543 --> 14:33.273
to-do list... I need to...

14:33.375 --> 14:37.912
...clean the toilets? I'm just tired
of staring at that. Good-bye.

14:37.953 --> 14:42.428
I need the Tivo crossing over V-Jap networks,
i need to turn a cat into a spice rack,

14:42.506 --> 14:45.549
and I need to return this
thing to the patient in 307.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.763
All doable, don't need you. Thanks!

14:48.381 --> 14:50.767
So, nobody needs any help.

14:51.668 --> 14:53.474
When is your wife coming back to work?

14:53.521 --> 14:55.523
I'm drowning here without
the Head Nurse.

15:01.810 --> 15:06.802
Ok, ladies, I posted your room assignments
on the board and we'll pass out

15:06.837 --> 15:09.429
the new weekly schedules
before your shifts are over.

15:11.252 --> 15:13.145
Being a nurse isn't so bad.

15:14.459 --> 15:16.336
What did you think
it would be like?

15:17.890 --> 15:18.938
We're losing him.

15:18.970 --> 15:20.268
BP's falling.

15:20.315 --> 15:23.131
Nurse Kelso I need
1 mg of epy! Stack!

15:24.375 --> 15:26.378
Now nurse, now!

15:30.358 --> 15:38.879
<i>* "Up Where we Belong" from "An officer
and a gentleman" in Vietnamian *</i>

15:41.186 --> 15:45.377
Way to go Bob, way to go! That a boy!

15:46.061 --> 15:47.797
I'm sorry what
was the question?

15:52.037 --> 15:55.853
Jumbo Latte for Dr. Reid,
with the employee discount.

15:56.078 --> 15:58.722
- YEAAAH!
- YEAAAH!

15:59.535 --> 16:02.921
- Employee's discount
- YEAAH!

16:02.956 --> 16:04.370
Uhm, neat.

16:04.514 --> 16:07.284
Would you like to see something
else that's really neat?

16:07.331 --> 16:09.208
Check out to this quote written on your cup.

16:09.318 --> 16:11.836
"I enjoy laughing at poor people"

16:11.868 --> 16:14.739
Elliot Reid - April 2006

16:14.848 --> 16:17.977
When I said that, I was watching "Good Time"!

16:18.060 --> 16:22.253
That's gonna be on every Jumbo Cup for
a month, courtesy of my anti-war peeps.

16:22.253 --> 16:23.553
Can I get a hell HEAH?

16:23.853 --> 16:25.562
HELL YEAH!!

16:25.562 --> 16:27.126
OH YEAH!!

16:27.233 --> 16:30.539
Typical lame liberal tactic,
taking something out of context

16:30.540 --> 16:31.540
in order to defame someone's integrity.
Am I right my pro-war amigos?

16:35.986 --> 16:39.330
- YEAH!!
- OH YEAH!!

16:39.651 --> 16:40.627
Gods, there seems to be a lot of

16:40.628 --> 16:44.011
high volume over enthusiastic
opinion sharing, going on today.

16:44.114 --> 16:46.148
I think I'll join it.

16:52.375 --> 16:55.645
- Employee discount!
- OH YEAAAH!

16:56.543 --> 17:00.454
- Ok...I've...I've seen enough.
- Replying that.

17:06.565 --> 17:09.756
Uhm, consider that a little gift
from Nurse Roberts' nephew,

17:09.835 --> 17:11.320
Corporal Roberts.

17:13.519 --> 17:14.896
Hell, yeah!

17:18.885 --> 17:23.047
Ok, Janice I'm going to need you to
make sure Mr. Jeffers gets his meds,

17:23.137 --> 17:26.861
and FYI, don't lean over him, he's handsy.

17:26.993 --> 17:31.640
and Denise, could you do me a major large
and cover Jessica shift this weekend?

17:31.750 --> 17:33.314
I have to have a pap smear.

17:33.623 --> 17:37.946
Have you seen Georgina lately? She
looks like she's been eating for two...

17:38.040 --> 17:39.917
- Oh, stop it!
- You stop it.

17:39.980 --> 17:43.961
Oh, Nurse Kelso, ooh,
purple is not your color.

17:44.044 --> 17:46.860
Listen, could you con out the
housekeeping and maybe send up

17:46.861 --> 17:49.348
some fresh scrubs for me
and--psst, come here.

17:50.267 --> 17:53.443
Please put on a bra, you're distracting
some of the other doctors.

17:53.940 --> 17:58.008
<i>Let him joke, you look spippy
and you're doing great.</i>

17:58.297 --> 18:02.037
Why did he tell me to give meds to Mr.
Jeffers? I did that five minutes ago.

18:02.209 --> 18:05.651
Girl, just homily. He'll be outta here, eventually.

18:08.862 --> 18:11.506
Private, I'm gonna let you
hand on a little secret.

18:11.971 --> 18:15.914
That you were never in the navy,
and Johnny is your husband?

18:16.610 --> 18:17.324
If only.

18:18.266 --> 18:19.497
<i> I love you, Johnny.</i>

18:19.817 --> 18:24.167
Your fighting in that war has provoked some
pretty idiot argument amongst the staff.

18:26.095 --> 18:30.335
See, the thing is they think they can
just put their squabbles in a box

18:30.413 --> 18:32.940
that won't affect their work.
But they're wrong.

18:33.472 --> 18:38.271
I mean... judging from the
coffee stains on Dr. Cox's scrubs

18:38.302 --> 18:41.447
and the quote on this coffee cup attributed to Dr. Reid

18:42.046 --> 18:46.645
"My bagingo's on fire"
May 2004

18:48.230 --> 18:49.748
What's a "Bagingo"?

18:50.499 --> 18:53.190
Eventually, your page is gonna go unreturned

18:53.237 --> 18:56.413
your test isn't gonna get run as quickly
as they should have been, and

18:58.345 --> 19:00.692
sounds like kids like yourself
gonna pay the price.

19:01.376 --> 19:04.557
What bothers me about it,
is that I know this is going on,

19:04.558 --> 19:06.120
but there's nothing I can do to change it.

19:06.574 --> 19:07.341
Why not?

19:07.669 --> 19:12.989
Let's just say that 'round here I'm not
as loved as your sergent was.

19:13.579 --> 19:15.254
We hated Sgt. Bourne

19:16.310 --> 19:20.096
- Come again?
- Yeah, he demeaned us, overworked us.

19:21.105 --> 19:24.828
Still, maybe sometimes that's
what being a good leader is...

19:29.248 --> 19:34.083
...uniting everybody...by
giving them someone to hate.

19:34.701 --> 19:38.143
All right, listen up gang.
I'm only going to say this once.

19:38.639 --> 19:41.909
<i>All right Bob, time to bring it home</i>

19:42.218 --> 19:46.849
From this point on there will be
no more employee discounts, here.

19:46.896 --> 19:49.642
Everyone pays full price,

19:49.736 --> 19:53.397
except for me, of course.
Where's my Jumbo latte?

19:55.310 --> 19:57.171
You mind telling us why?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.463
Why the hell not?

20:00.423 --> 20:01.627
<i>That i will do it.</i>

20:03.672 --> 20:04.939
<i>[ people complaining ]</i>

20:08.143 --> 20:11.362
<i>Since I've spent this afternoon
researching the war in Iraq,</i>

20:11.393 --> 20:13.811
<i>I couldn't wait to dive right
into the spirit of debate.</i>

20:14.452 --> 20:17.847
- What a jackass!

20:17.972 --> 20:20.256
Come on, no one wants to debate Iraq with me?

20:21.074 --> 20:24.828
- I'll debate Iraq with you.
- Prepare to be dazzled.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.881
Ok, in my opinion we should be
looking for Bin Laden in Pakistan.

20:30.091 --> 20:32.033
You've that globe nearby?

20:34.982 --> 20:37.798
<i>In life it seems we all have a role to play...</i>

20:37.908 --> 20:39.551
<i>...someone of us are meant to be loved...</i>

20:41.711 --> 20:44.214
<i>...and some of us, unfortunately,
are meant to be hated.</i>

20:44.761 --> 20:47.093
Good night minions, Slugathor.

20:47.160 --> 20:51.055
<i>For Dr. Kelso, he wouldn't have
it any other way [love, TN]</i>

20:51.056 --> 20:52.018
