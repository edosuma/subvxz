WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.837
- Next is a Bravo
original comedy.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.577
- Happy Valentine's Day,
honey!

00:09.610 --> 00:12.346
- What?
What's going on?

00:12.380 --> 00:13.847
We don't do Valentine's day.

00:13.881 --> 00:16.317
- I know.
But just open it.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.156
- I love it.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.491
Thank you.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.759
- Now read the card.

00:25.793 --> 00:29.763
- "I love you and I really don't
want to end up like this guy."

00:29.797 --> 00:31.765
I don't get it.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.833
With your head
on my boobs?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.001
I thought you liked that.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.503
- I meant like a dead man.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.338
We're having dinner
at my mother's tonight

00:37.371 --> 00:39.473
to celebrate Brooke and Lex
getting back together.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.175
I'm sorry!
- At her place?

00:41.209 --> 00:43.144
But she hasn't invited us
back there since--

00:43.177 --> 00:45.113
- I know;
I was surprised too.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.614
I guess she's forgotten.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.651
- No, she remembers.
She's the human iCloud.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.121
She's setting a trap for me.
She's planning something.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.489
- Jill, you spilled a little
red wine on her couch.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.526
- Her white couch,
custom-made in Milan.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.862
And it wasn't exactly a little.
It was the flag of Japan.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.331
- Well, she seems to have
let it go,

01:03.364 --> 01:06.400
so can you please try to
for me?

01:06.434 --> 01:08.536
- Yes, because I love you,

01:08.569 --> 01:11.372
I'm willing to risk my life
and go back to your mother's.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.407
- Okay, my mother
is a lot of things.

01:13.441 --> 01:16.810
But she's not a murderer.
Jill.

01:16.844 --> 01:20.548
- All I know is, the dry cleaner
who ruined her Chanel suit

01:20.581 --> 01:22.250
vanished into thin air.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.385
Coincidence?
I think not.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.054
- * Hey, yes, you know

01:27.155 --> 01:30.624
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:33.794 --> 01:35.196
- Ooh!

01:35.229 --> 01:38.366
A von Weber Valentine's Day!
How romantic.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.334
Maybe you should get
everyone lingerie.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.869
See where the night takes you.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.205
- Vaness, this is food.
I have to digest it.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.073
- And now we turn our attention
back to Yak Polio...

01:46.174 --> 01:48.442
- Ugh.
More Yak Polio.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.178
- Claimed another life,
this time in the United States.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.846
The virus was first discovered
in southeast Asia.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.849
It is thought to originate
with yaks themselves.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.451
- Should I be freaking out
about that?

01:57.485 --> 01:58.886
- No.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.654
I mean, I wouldn't
go to a yak petting zoo,

02:00.688 --> 02:03.691
but you know how the media
latches onto this stuff.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.026
Hey, your divorced dude
finally called me.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.027
We're going out tonight.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.362
- Bruce?
Yay!

02:08.396 --> 02:09.963
I've been waiting
four years

02:09.997 --> 02:11.465
for his sucky marriage
to crumble

02:11.499 --> 02:12.733
so I could fix you guys up.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.702
- And you're sure he's not gay?

02:14.735 --> 02:18.872
Every Bruce I've ever known
is LGBTQQIA.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.708
Sensitivity training.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.211
- He is none of those letters;
he's a non-gay Bruce.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.112
- And he's not hung up
on his ex?

02:25.213 --> 02:27.080
I'm convinced
newly-divorced guys

02:27.114 --> 02:28.949
only date for the free therapy.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.718
- Stop trying to find excuses.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.085
And text me updates.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.754
I'm going to need
a distraction

02:33.787 --> 02:34.955
while I'm getting von-tortured
at Candace's.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.458
[cell phone vibrating]

02:37.491 --> 02:39.227
- Weird number.
Should I get it?

02:39.227 --> 02:41.629
Could be a solicitor!
No!

02:41.662 --> 02:43.731
- You love a good
phone confrontation.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.267
I've gotta go anyway.
Happy VD.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.968
- Hello?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.970
- Am I speaking
with Vanessa Wrigley?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.839
- Uh, depends.
Who is this?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.907
- I'm calling from the Centers
for Disease Control.

02:53.941 --> 02:57.010
You're listed as the emergency
contact for Graham Whitman.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.979
He collapsed on the Jetway
at JFK.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.648
We need you to come for him
immediately.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.650
- I'm his emergency contact?

03:02.683 --> 03:05.319
I mean, I'll be right there.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.792
- [gasps]
Look at this!

03:11.825 --> 03:12.826
This is magic.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.262
We're in "The Jetsons."

03:14.262 --> 03:15.796
- I mean, who asks their guests

03:15.829 --> 03:18.799
to scour the city
for $500 worth of peonies?

03:18.832 --> 03:20.768
It's like she thinks
we're her Oompa Loompas.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.102
- Come on.
That was fun.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.671
I've never been
to the flower district.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.439
- And you know
she's never gonna pay us back.

03:25.473 --> 03:28.476
I haven't been paid one red cent
for all the luncheons

03:28.509 --> 03:30.478
I shot for her charities
this year.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.912
- Come on, Valentine.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.283
- Like, why do we have to come
two hours early?

03:35.283 --> 03:36.550
- You know, she's just nervous.
She gets--

03:36.584 --> 03:38.352
- Holy shit!

03:38.386 --> 03:40.454
all: Demand insurance
for Yak Polio.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.189
- I forgot the doorman strike.
[cell phone ringing]

03:42.290 --> 03:44.292
Everyone was freaking out
about it at drop-off.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.294
- Hello, Mother.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.195
- What's that horrible noise?

03:48.296 --> 03:49.897
Are you in a discotheque?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.332
- No, the doormen are on strike.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.801
You may want to rethink
this dinner.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.736
- We're New Yorkers, Anderson.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.539
We don't stop living just
because of a little strike.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.574
Otherwise, the terrorists win.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.142
- They're doormen,
not terrorists,

04:02.175 --> 04:04.177
and I'm assuming
there's no elevator service.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.347
- Well, then you're going
to have wait for the caterers

04:06.380 --> 04:08.148
to help them
bring everything up,

04:08.181 --> 04:10.217
and tell Jill she's gonna
be writing the place cards.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.386
- Yours is going to say,
"Oedipus."

04:12.420 --> 04:14.221
Bionic ears.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.756
- Be right there.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.962
[monitor beeping]

04:24.865 --> 04:28.836
- V?
What are you doing here?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.938
- I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.940
- Really?
- No!

04:32.973 --> 04:34.542
I'm here because
you haven't updated

04:34.575 --> 04:37.378
your emergency contact
for 11 years.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.946
Want to tell me what's going on?

04:38.979 --> 04:41.549
- Dr. Whitman has been working
with a mobile clinic

04:41.582 --> 04:44.752
in the Himalayas, and he's been
exposed to Yak Polio.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.355
- I have none
of the diagnostic signs.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.923
Classic CDC overreaction.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.360
- Even if your supplies were
being hauled by yaks,

04:52.393 --> 04:54.227
did you lick one of them?

04:54.261 --> 04:55.729
- Hey, what happens
in the Himalayas

04:55.763 --> 04:57.531
stays in the Himalayas.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.532
- Okay, he's fine.

04:58.566 --> 04:59.867
- Sorry, doctors,

04:59.900 --> 05:01.435
but the exposed patient
needs to be kept

05:01.469 --> 05:03.704
in isolation for 24 hours.

05:03.737 --> 05:07.074
And no flying for 30 days.
Can he stay with you?

05:07.107 --> 05:09.977
I assume you're friends
or family?

05:10.010 --> 05:12.713
- Yes, he can stay with me,
but no.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.716
We're not friends or family.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.184
He's my ex-husband.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.891
- Oh, my God.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.394
It's like a One-Percenter's
apocalypse.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.061
Do I smell...
[sniffs]

05:28.095 --> 05:29.797
rotting Camembert?

05:29.830 --> 05:30.798
- [chuckles]

05:30.831 --> 05:33.233
[groans]

05:33.266 --> 05:35.603
Okay, full disclosure:

05:35.636 --> 05:37.170
I do know
how to work the elevator.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.639
- You do?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.073
- When I was a kid,
I spent a lot of time

05:40.107 --> 05:41.575
riding it with
my favorite doorman, Ivan.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.944
He called me "Elevator Andy."

05:43.977 --> 05:47.014
- Oh, good!
Then let's do this.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.682
- I don't think we're supposed
to work the elevator

05:48.716 --> 05:50.183
during a strike.

05:50.217 --> 05:53.754
- My seizure medication
is upstairs.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.189
- Just this one trip.

05:56.223 --> 05:59.993
Honey, if you please,
Elevator Andy is here!

06:04.465 --> 06:07.768
- I'm so sick
of these whiny doormen.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.770
Let's go.
- Jill, are you coming?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.672
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Actually, no.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.474
I'm taking the stairs.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.875
This doesn't feel right.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.112
- I don't know,
but I've been told...

06:19.146 --> 06:22.483
- Oh, my God.
I am dead.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.984
- Jill, no bread!

06:24.017 --> 06:25.352
Take that back down to the van.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.720
They must have messed up
my order.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.556
- What?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.724
- Ah, the peonies!

06:30.758 --> 06:32.292
Oh, my God,
they're the wrong color.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.495
I specifically said sorbet.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.464
- Well, the guy
in the flower district said

06:36.464 --> 06:38.999
that was just
"pretentious for pink."

06:39.032 --> 06:40.233
His words, not mine.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.070
- Well, he's wrong.
These are wrong.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.539
You're a driver now--
why don't you zip back there

06:45.573 --> 06:47.207
and trade them in for white?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.210
And while you're down there,
could you ask the doormen

06:50.243 --> 06:51.912
to keep it down?

06:51.945 --> 06:55.983
- Well, they are chanting
because they're angry.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.819
And they feel
taken advantage of.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.589
- Oh, here comes Hanoi Jill.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.191
You know, I don't have time
for a political debate.

07:04.224 --> 07:07.227
You could have been
there and back by now.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.696
- Okay.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.667
[all chanting "scab"]

07:13.701 --> 07:15.903
Carlton, hi.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.071
Did somebody cross
the picket line?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.607
- Yeah, your husband.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.341
I heard he took my elevator.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.344
- Oh, right, that's only
'cause he has mommy issues.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.179
all: Scab! Scab! Scab!

07:26.213 --> 07:28.115
- No, no, guys!

07:28.148 --> 07:30.884
I'm with you.
I live in a walk-up, okay?

07:30.918 --> 07:34.354
My front door is, like,
a collage of UPS post-its.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.525
I know what it feels like
to be disrespected

07:37.558 --> 07:39.059
and misunderstood...

07:39.092 --> 07:42.395
Here, have a baguette.
Take some bread, please.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.865
She is a gluten-phobe.
She doesn't want it.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.199
I think it's sourdough.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.769
[indistinct]
They're all yours.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.938
Here, and you know what?
Take the peonies.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.041
She doesn't want 'em,
'cause they're not sorbet.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.375
- Thank you.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.044
Would you like a sign?

07:57.077 --> 07:58.546
- Um...

07:58.546 --> 08:00.548
Yes.
Yes, I do.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.188
- They buy their food
from Dean & DeLuca!

08:09.990 --> 08:11.258
all: Buy their food
from Dean & DeLuca!

08:11.291 --> 08:13.561
- Their attitude
just makes me puke-a.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.595
all: Their attitude
just makes me puke-a.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.330
- Anderson, I'm famished.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.399
Be a dear, would you,
and make me a martini.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.302
No olives, no vermouth.
- So a shot of gin?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.604
- And I'm out of Xanax.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.905
It should have come
in today's mail,

08:24.938 --> 08:26.306
which hasn't arrived,
for some reason.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.908
- That's because
of the strike, Mother.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.409
Your mail is not gonna
get sorted or delivered

08:29.442 --> 08:31.579
until it's over.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.648
- How many people's lives
have to be destroyed

08:34.682 --> 08:37.184
for this madness to end?

08:37.217 --> 08:39.687
Be a dear, would you,
and fetch it for me?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.089
You know I haven't entertained
since...

08:42.122 --> 08:44.024
- Yes, we all know.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.960
And Jill really appreciates you
opening your doors to us again.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.862
- Well, she has a funny way
of showing it.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.364
What is she,
on the Pony Express?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.466
- They drive out
to their Hamptons house!

08:53.500 --> 08:55.703
all: They drive out
to their Hamptons house!

08:55.736 --> 08:58.438
- But treat me
like a freakin' louse.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.307
all: But treat me
like a freakin' louse.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.042
- Okay, guys, one more time!

09:02.075 --> 09:06.013
I don't think they can hear us
in the penthouse!

09:06.046 --> 09:09.116
- Von Weber Xanax,
you have to be here somewhere...

09:09.149 --> 09:11.819
von Patrick...

09:11.852 --> 09:13.987
von Essen...

09:14.021 --> 09:15.522
- On their asses!

09:15.623 --> 09:17.057
For these Marie Antoinettes,

09:17.090 --> 09:18.892
this is nothing,
your pay raise!

09:18.926 --> 09:20.961
- Jill?
- Revolution!

09:20.994 --> 09:22.796
Fight, fight, fight!

09:22.830 --> 09:24.898
- Anderson,
what is taking so long?

09:24.932 --> 09:26.667
I need my Xanax.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.035
- Mother, how did you
get down here?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.737
- The stairs.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.706
I'm doing Barry's Boot Camp
four times a week.

09:32.740 --> 09:36.343
Ooh, Express Scripts!
I'd know that package anywhere!

09:36.376 --> 09:38.511
- No, that is
Mrs. von Hewson's Vicodin.

09:38.545 --> 09:39.913
She's already called down
about it.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.149
And this is Mrs. von Trier's
Percocet.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.351
I have a system.

09:44.384 --> 09:48.255
- Why don't I just deliver these
on my way back up?

09:48.288 --> 09:49.522
[pills rattling]

09:49.556 --> 09:52.726
Takes a village, right?

09:52.760 --> 09:55.729
- Mother, it's a felony
to tamper with U.S. mail!

10:00.467 --> 10:02.602
- Welcome
to your isolation chamber.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.238
Can I get you anything?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.539
Some water?

10:06.573 --> 10:09.677
- Uh, no, thanks.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.011
- Oh my God,

10:11.044 --> 10:12.680
please don't make me
feel guilty

10:12.713 --> 10:14.381
for having
running water again.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.249
- People in Burundi would kill
for that stuff.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.952
You know what's going on
over there, right?

10:18.986 --> 10:21.855
- Yes, Graham, we all know
what's going on over there.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.757
It's awful.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.625
So I'm going to go shower,

10:25.659 --> 10:27.795
and it's gonna take
longer than 90 seconds.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.897
Do you think
you can handle that?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.364
- Let's find out.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.934
- So, help yourself
to soy sauce packets

10:33.967 --> 10:36.536
and anything else in the fridge.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.038
I'm gonna go get ready
for my date.

10:38.071 --> 10:41.241
- Oh, you have a...
tonight?

10:41.274 --> 10:43.243
- Yes.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.712
Why, is it medically
irresponsible

10:44.745 --> 10:46.113
for me to leave you alone here?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.381
- No, I don't have Yak Polio, V.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.484
I might have a few hundred
parasites, but that's it.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.920
- I am not checking you
for pinworms again.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.421
Fool me once...

10:54.454 --> 10:56.724
- Just go on your date--
I know how to self-check now

10:56.757 --> 10:58.826
with a hand mirror
and an iPhone.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.994
It's called
the Burundi-up-and-undi.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.730
- Bye.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.500
- Come on, guys,
a little more pep.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.602
We're getting soggy here.
Okay, listen up!

11:09.636 --> 11:11.972
Their highlights cost
more than my rent.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.941
- Excuse-o me-o!

11:13.974 --> 11:15.575
Pear-don-o.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.812
"Mi siento."
Grazie.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.414
- Jill.
What are you doing?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.083
- Fighting injustice.
[megaphone feeds back]

11:23.116 --> 11:25.118
- Jilly-Beans,
if you'd come upstairs with us,

11:25.152 --> 11:26.754
I can tell you what I learned

11:26.787 --> 11:29.156
about compassionate capitalism
at Electric Forest.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.092
This is an outdated model
for conflict resolution.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.593
- So we're supposed to do
nothing

11:33.626 --> 11:35.495
while people's rights
are being violated?

11:35.528 --> 11:36.997
- Do what you want,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.999
but Candace's caterers
have been slaving

11:39.032 --> 11:40.834
over a hot stove
for this dinner.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.202
Let's go, Lex.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.038
- But I just really want Jill
to be there.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.040
Don't be long, Jill.
- What's the big deal?

11:47.074 --> 11:48.375
You've been acting weird
all day.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.677
Did you take your bee pollen?
Come on.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.446
- So Jill...

11:53.480 --> 11:54.882
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.550
We appreciate
all that you're doing here.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.419
- Well, I completely
support you.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.189
I'm a freelance photographer,
and you'd be amazed

12:02.222 --> 12:04.057
how many people never pay me.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.059
All right, guys, how 'bout
a little Bob Marley?

12:06.093 --> 12:07.861
"Get up, stand up!"
Or Les Mis!

12:07.895 --> 12:09.362
"Do you hear the people sing?"

12:09.396 --> 12:11.498
- Some of the guys are asking
for a little break

12:11.531 --> 12:13.867
from all the chanting,
but how would you feel

12:13.901 --> 12:15.202
about doing a coffee run?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.237
- Oh, okay, I mean...

12:17.270 --> 12:18.471
Sure.
Whatever you need.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.639
- Great.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.809
So two grande skinny lattes,

12:21.809 --> 12:25.846
one mega Earl Grey,
one half-caf red spice mocha.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.248
- Okay, I'm gonna need a pen.

12:33.821 --> 12:36.824
[cell phone ringing musically]

12:37.825 --> 12:40.093
- You will not believe my day.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.829
- Me first:
what is happening in Burundi?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.263
- Uh...

12:43.296 --> 12:44.832
I don't know.
Civil war?

12:44.832 --> 12:47.200
Drought? Floods?
Why?

12:47.234 --> 12:48.601
- Graham is here!

12:48.635 --> 12:51.872
- Graham...
Graham-Graham?

12:51.905 --> 12:54.207
Oh, my God.
You cannot see him.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.676
- Well, that's impossible.
He's in my apartment.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.112
- What? Why?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.547
- Long story,
but it's only for a few days.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.183
Like, no more than 30.
- No!

13:03.216 --> 13:04.684
You're meeting non-gay Bruce

13:04.717 --> 13:06.219
and I don't want Graham
to ruin it.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.222
How does he look?
Is he still scorchingly hot?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.524
- He's aged annoyingly well.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.060
But don't worry,
my date is still on.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.694
- Okay, good.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.930
Because Graham had his chance
with you and he blew it.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.567
Big time--so keep you eyes
on the non-gay prize

13:20.600 --> 13:23.036
and don't let Graham
suck you back in.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.438
Oh, and tell him I say hi.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.777
- All right, ma'am, sir!
If you will.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.312
Tell Mom I'll be right there.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.881
Just gotta park this thing,
pick up Norma Rae,

13:33.914 --> 13:35.448
and be right back up.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.893
[thud]

13:45.926 --> 13:47.895
Shit.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.663
Lex? Brooke?

13:50.697 --> 13:52.365
[elevator clanks ominously]

13:52.399 --> 13:54.001
Guys?

13:54.034 --> 13:56.036
[cell phone rings musically]

13:58.071 --> 14:00.173
- Andy, I know this is hard,

14:00.207 --> 14:01.774
but I really need you
to understand

14:01.808 --> 14:03.610
why I need to stay down here.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.979
- The walls are closing in,
Jill...

14:06.013 --> 14:08.949
[cries]
- Hello? Where are you?

14:08.982 --> 14:11.985
- I need air.
Can't...breathe.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.923
- Yes, that's exactly how I feel
every time I'm at your mother's.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.324
- [breaking up]
I'm not...the apartment.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.159
I'm stuck

14:19.192 --> 14:20.493
in the...

14:20.527 --> 14:21.929
- You're stuck where?

14:21.929 --> 14:23.830
- Oh!
Oh, God.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.532
- Hello?

14:29.402 --> 14:30.437
- Andy, we're coming for you.
It's all gonna be okay.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.174
- Oh, my God...
Oh, my God.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.276
- Guys, I'm breaking
the strike right now,

14:36.309 --> 14:38.111
so you better make it
worth my while.

14:38.145 --> 14:41.514
- Do you have anything?
- Um, I have about eight bucks.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.217
And some dinosaur gummies.
- What?

14:44.251 --> 14:46.486
- Oh, my God.
- Um, what about photography?

14:46.519 --> 14:49.656
I do weddings, baptisms,
any bar mitzvahs coming up?

14:49.689 --> 14:52.325
- Hey, you know what, the
union's overhauling the website.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.594
Will you shoot our headshots
and waive the fee?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.629
- Done.
Seems to be my specialty.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.566
- Okay, Andy, listen up.
- Yeah!

14:59.599 --> 15:01.301
- These things become
death machines

15:01.334 --> 15:02.970
if you don't know
how to use 'em right.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.172
- Oh, no!
I'm gonna die in here!

15:05.205 --> 15:07.174
- No, you're not!
You're Elevator Andy!

15:07.207 --> 15:08.375
He can do this!

15:08.408 --> 15:10.477
- He is a complex superhero.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.844
He has issues.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.313
- Just shut up

15:13.346 --> 15:15.715
and jimmy the lever left,
and then right,

15:15.748 --> 15:17.484
and then give it two bangs.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.019
Can you do that?

15:19.052 --> 15:20.587
- I don't know.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.689
- Yes, you can.
I believe in you.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.024
- Okay.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.059
[mutters indistinctly]

15:26.093 --> 15:30.263
[dramatic music]

15:30.297 --> 15:33.800
*

15:36.236 --> 15:38.238
- [in a low voice]
I think the couple behind us

15:38.271 --> 15:40.173
is gonna be divorced
by St. Patty's day.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.708
- [chuckles]

15:41.741 --> 15:43.876
- And how's my hottest couple
doing?

15:43.910 --> 15:46.713
Have you decided
on your dirty desserts yet?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.448
It is Valentine's Day.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.683
- I'll have
the "Jamaican Me Horny."

15:50.717 --> 15:53.286
Can I get that with extra rum,
please?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.655
- And I will have
one "Chocogasm"

15:55.688 --> 15:58.358
with special sauce, please.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.261
Is everything okay?
[cell phone vibrates]

16:01.294 --> 16:04.931
- Actually, sorry,
do you mind if I take this?

16:05.032 --> 16:06.266
You were supposed to text.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.934
You okay?

16:08.035 --> 16:10.203
You sure?
No temperature?

16:10.237 --> 16:13.440
Good.
But don't call again.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.909
No, I have no idea if "Jurassic
World" is a good movie.

16:16.943 --> 16:20.047
Get some sleep.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.482
- Jill didn't say
that you had kids.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.951
- Kids?
Ha, no.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.954
No, that was my ex-husband.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.456
- Ah.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.324
She also didn't mention
that you were divorced.

16:31.358 --> 16:34.127
- Oh, trust me,
I forget half the time.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.497
We were married for ten minutes
eons ago.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.167
I mean, we're talking
dial-up modem age.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.771
Most of my friends
don't even know he exists.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.906
So tell me about your ex?

16:46.939 --> 16:48.241
- [chuckles]

16:49.642 --> 16:51.244
- [whispers] Okay.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.845
- Yes, I survived,

16:52.879 --> 16:54.581
but I also had a lot of time
to think in there,

16:54.614 --> 16:56.349
and you still
haven't answered me:

16:56.383 --> 16:58.851
Did you make Ivan babysit me
on YaYa's days off?

16:58.885 --> 17:00.720
Is that why I spent
so much time in the elevator?

17:00.753 --> 17:04.357
- He didn't mind.
It was part of his job.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.594
- Okay, did you deliver any of
those pills to your neighbors?

17:07.627 --> 17:10.263
- Oh, baby, baby...

17:10.297 --> 17:12.365
honey, come on, now.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.667
Just relax.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.670
It's so good to have
all my chickens home to roost.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.139
- Cocktail, please?

17:19.172 --> 17:23.176
- So damned good...
- Gazpacho is served.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.346
[glass clinks]
Excuse me.

17:28.215 --> 17:32.485
As the great philosopher
Eckhart Tolle once said,

17:32.519 --> 17:35.522
"You can lose something
that you have,

17:35.555 --> 17:39.526
but you can't lose something
that you are."

17:39.559 --> 17:41.561
- Okay...

17:41.594 --> 17:44.497
- Brooke, I've realized
something.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.799
I...

17:46.833 --> 17:50.837
am you, Brooke.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.140
You are the best me

17:53.173 --> 17:55.142
that I am.

17:55.142 --> 17:59.146
And I want to ask you,
on this beloved holiday,

17:59.146 --> 18:03.416
in front of all of the people
who love me most,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.252
for your hand

18:05.285 --> 18:09.055
in re-marriage.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.424
Brooke von Weber,

18:11.458 --> 18:14.060
will you be my re-bride?

18:14.161 --> 18:16.329
- What?

18:16.363 --> 18:20.032
So that's why
you've been acting so weird.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.601
Yes!

18:21.634 --> 18:25.172
The answer is yes!

18:25.205 --> 18:27.340
On one condition.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.509
And I think you know
what that is.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.512
- This?

18:32.545 --> 18:36.249
Babe, no,
because this is a symbol

18:36.283 --> 18:38.285
of everything
that we've been through.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.921
It's a symbol of
my emotional vulnerability,

18:41.954 --> 18:43.523
my openness.
I--

18:43.556 --> 18:44.524
- Here you go.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.558
- Thank you.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.928
- [sighs]

18:55.268 --> 18:57.003
- I can't believe it!

18:57.036 --> 18:58.905
We're getting married!

18:58.938 --> 18:59.939
- Again.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.809
[glass clinks]

19:12.051 --> 19:15.021
[indistinct chatter
on television]

19:16.956 --> 19:18.258
- Hey!

19:18.291 --> 19:20.126
I want you to know I skipped
"Jurassic World"

19:20.227 --> 19:21.928
so that we could watch it
together tomorrow.

19:21.961 --> 19:25.665
Or whenever you're not out
painting the town red.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.400
- Yeah.
Listen.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.836
- Uh-oh.
Bad date?

19:29.869 --> 19:33.240
- No, it was fine, but you can't
stay here after tomorrow.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.242
- Really?
Why?

19:35.275 --> 19:37.444
- Come on.
We did not end well.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.448
- Yeah.
I still feel bad.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.617
- No, I feel bad.
- Why would you feel bad?

19:44.651 --> 19:46.152
- Maybe just embarrassed.

19:46.253 --> 19:50.089
I was like,
"It's me or Zimbabwe."

19:50.122 --> 19:51.758
What was that trip,
like, a month?

19:51.791 --> 19:53.626
- Well, yeah,
but I could have stayed longer,

19:53.660 --> 19:55.662
to work things out.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.997
- Can't we just blame our 20s
and call it even?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.666
- Sure.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.934
But I'm kinda bummed.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.803
It's good to see you.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.004
- Really?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.739
- Yeah.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.881
- Oh, my God.
That didn't happen.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.182
Control+Z.
Good night.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.784
- No, no.
I just felt weird.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.186
But I'm fine.
Come back.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.823
- Are you sure?

20:24.924 --> 20:32.865
*

20:34.501 --> 20:37.437
- Well, the good news is,
we won't be having dinner

20:37.470 --> 20:39.739
at your mother's apartment
any time soon.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.841
- Yeah, well, I'll need
the time to process the fact

20:41.874 --> 20:44.644
that I was raised by my doorman.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.347
- Oh, Scabby the Rat
is deflating.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.616
Carlton, what happened?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.751
- Oh, guys downtown
worked out a settlement.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.253
We got more overtime pay
and more help.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.456
No summer uniforms,
but I'm okay with that.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.426
- Well, thank you again
for saving me, Carlton.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.994
And I am very sorry
about the whole scab thing.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.764
- All is forgiven.
I mean, grudges are like rocks.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.334
The more you hold,
the heavier you get.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.768
- That's so true.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.870
- "Joy Manifesto."

21:10.903 --> 21:12.539
Uh, Mrs. Weber,
I'll give you a call

21:12.572 --> 21:14.073
about those head shots
for the union.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.207
- Great.
- All right.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.242
Good night, folks.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.944
- Night.
- Yep.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.479
[mutters]
So sick of enlightenment.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.084
