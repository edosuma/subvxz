Congratulations,
everybody.

Now, who's ready
for a nice boiled egg?

10:09.677 --> 10:10.944
Both: Me!

10:10.978 --> 10:13.013
Wait a minute.
What even happened in there?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.848
Where's
the telemetry capsule?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.684
Don't you see, Jermaine?

10:16.717 --> 10:19.186
You were inside the capsule
all along,

10:19.219 --> 10:21.354
learning valuable lessons
while you programmed

10:21.388 --> 10:24.792
its Jake-extracting telemetry
with your minds.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.159
Of course.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.828
And you, Betty --

10:27.861 --> 10:31.131
finally, you've learned
that most pressing of lessons --

10:31.164 --> 10:33.266
that sometimes,
for our own good,

10:33.300 --> 10:37.004
we must accept the loss
of that which we hold most dear.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.774
I've learned that I just
got to work even harder

10:40.808 --> 10:41.809
to get it back.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.976
What?!

10:43.010 --> 10:44.477
Like, did you see Finn
in there?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.947
He was indomitable!

10:46.980 --> 10:48.348
Yeah, I guess, but --

10:48.381 --> 10:51.284
So, as I stared
into that endless white void,

10:51.318 --> 10:53.386
I came up with a plan.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.822
A plan?

10:54.855 --> 10:57.124
For me --
to save my Simon.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.227
And for you --
to finally pull Margles back

11:00.260 --> 11:02.863
