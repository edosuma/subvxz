00:04.045 --> 00:05.588
- No, no, no, I got it.

You got more important things
to do like scrapbooking,

surprise slumber party.

my scrapbooking kit.

- Dad, there's no way
we're going.

- Please, guys, look,
since the school year started,

00:30.280 --> 00:33.783
Maddie's just driving everyone
insane at Iridium.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.535
- So what's new?
- Well, it's getting worse.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.496
And you know I've got teachers
asking me to be transferred

00:38.580 --> 00:39.956
out of the district?

00:40.039 --> 00:42.751
There's only so much
a principal can do.

- So you want us to suffer
through a sleepover

00:46.671 --> 00:47.922

00:48.006 --> 00:49.924

I--I mean, just
please--please help me.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.970
I'm desperate, please?

00:54.053 --> 00:55.889
- Okay.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.307
- Yes!

00:57.390 --> 00:58.808
Thank you.

01:00.059 --> 01:00.769
- Hold up!

01:00.852 --> 01:03.271
I never said yes.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.772
What's in it for me?

01:04.855 --> 01:08.485
- Besides knowing
that you helped saved

01:08.568 --> 01:10.612
the sanity of Iridium High?

01:10.695 --> 01:12.280
- Yeah.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.990
How about a master key
that opens all the doors

01:14.073 --> 01:16.659
to the school?
- No way.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.661
- Okay, an unrestricted,
anytime hall pass?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.371
- Try again.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.666
- Unlimited free mozzarella
sticks from the cafeteria?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.084
- Is this ever gonna end?

01:25.168 --> 01:28.546
- Okay, an air freshener
for my locker?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.215
- Fine, that I can do.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.926
- Okay, well, then I'll need
to go home to get my bo staff.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.470
- Bo staff?
What for?

01:35.553 --> 01:38.640
- To keep Maddie at least five
feet away from me at all times.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.558
- I'll meet you
outside Maddie's.

if we try to use it,

07:32.451 --> 07:33.828

pizzas with her gross
