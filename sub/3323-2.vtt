you'd like to go to that party with me?

00:21.981 --> 00:23.096
Definitely yes.

Is this a party or a date?

00:25.234 --> 00:26.064
Maybe both.

- Allison.

- Hunters.

Maybe she gets
how much being the new girl can suck.

12:41.678 --> 12:42.713
Where did you get that?

12:43.472 --> 12:45.337
My jacket? It was in my locker.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.714
I think Lydia brought it back from the party.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.511
- She has my combination...
- Did she say she brought it back?

12:48.769 --> 12:49.929
Or did somebody give her the jacket?

12:50.145 --> 12:51.100
Like who?

12:51.355 --> 12:52.219
Like Derek.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.972
- Your friend?
- He's not my friend.

12:55.234 --> 12:57.816
How much did you talk to him
when he drove you home?

12:58.028 --> 12:58.938
Mmm, not much at all.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.143
What did you say?

13:02.532 --> 13:03.567
I gotta get to class.

13:03.825 --> 13:04.814
- I...
- Allison...

13:05.035 --> 13:06.991
No, I really have to go.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.665
Derek!

13:15.629 --> 13:17.335
Derek!

13:27.099 --> 13:28.054
Stay away from her!

13:28.976 --> 13:32.935
- She doesn't know anything.
- Yeah? What if she does?

13:33.981 --> 13:36.518
You think your little buddy Stiles
can just google "Werewolves"

13:36.775 --> 13:38.811
and now you've got all the answers,
is that it?

13:38.986 --> 13:41.352
You don't get it yet, Scott,
but I'm looking out for you.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.569
Think about what could happen.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.530
You're out on the field,

13:45.784 --> 13:47.866
the aggression takes over and you shift

13:48.078 --> 13:49.409
in front of everyone.

13:53.292 --> 13:54.953
Your mom, all your friends,

13:55.210 --> 13:56.950
and when they see you,

14:00.757 --> 14:03.009
everything falls apart.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.684
What did you find? How did you find it?
Where did you find it?

14:17.941 --> 14:19.477
And yes, I've had a lot of Adderall. So...

14:19.735 --> 14:20.895
I found something at Derek Hale's.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.022
- Are you kidding? What?
- There's something buried there.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.315
I could smell blood.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.064
That's awesome. I mean, that's terrible.
Whose blood?

14:27.784 --> 14:28.648
I don't know.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.401
But when we do,
your dad nails Derek for the murder.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.154
And then you help me figure out
how to play lacrosse without changing.

14:34.416 --> 14:38.250
Because there's no way
I'm not playing that game.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.514
Hey.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.217
Okay.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.022
- Good luck, I guess.
- Yeah.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.237
Oh, my God.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.659
Hey, Lydia.

15:12.913 --> 15:16.622
You probably don't remember me,
um, I sit behind you in biology.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.496
Uh, anyway, I always thought

15:21.046 --> 15:23.332
that we just had this kind of connection.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.881
You know, unspoken, of course.

15:26.051 --> 15:29.919
Maybe, it'd be kind of cool
to get to know each other a little better.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.220
Hold on. Give me a second.

15:32.474 --> 15:33.884
Yeah, I didn't get any of what you just said.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.219
Is it worth repeating?

15:35.477 --> 15:36.967
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

15:37.187 --> 15:39.269
No. Sorry.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.479
- I'm gonna sit. You don't care.
- Okay.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.717
(PANTING)

16:46.715 --> 16:47.545
Did he do it?

16:47.799 --> 16:50.632
He said not to make a habit of it,
but one cortisone shot won't kill me.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.337
You should get one
right before the game, too.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.345
The pros do it all the time.

16:55.599 --> 16:56.805
You want to be
a little high school amateur?

16:57.058 --> 16:57.968
Or,

16:59.227 --> 17:02.014
do you want to go pro?

17:11.114 --> 17:12.069
Holy God!

17:12.491 --> 17:13.446
The scent was the same.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.900
- You sure?
- Yes.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.693
(SIGHS) So he did bury
the other half of the body on his property.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.911
Which means
we have proof he killed the girl.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.824
- I say we use it.
- How?

17:24.085 --> 17:25.621
Tell me something first.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.164
Are you doing this
because you want to stop Derek

17:27.422 --> 17:29.287
or because you want to play
in the game and he said you couldn't?

17:29.508 --> 17:31.874
There were bite marks
on the legs, Stiles. Bite marks.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.508
Okay. Then we're gonna need a shovel.

18:10.340 --> 18:14.174
SCOTT: Wait, something's different.
STILES: Different how?

18:15.262 --> 18:18.095
I don't know.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.924
Let's just get this over with.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.663
- This is taking way too long.
- Just keep going.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.418
- What if he comes back?
- Then we get the hell out of here.

18:47.669 --> 18:48.784
What if he catches us?

18:49.379 --> 18:50.243
l have a plan for that.

18:50.505 --> 18:51.665
Which is?

18:53.091 --> 18:54.171
You run one way, I run the other.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.291
Whoever he catches first, too bad.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.008
I hate that plan.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.052
STILES: All right. Stop, stop, stop!

19:08.815 --> 19:10.146
- Hurry.
- I'm trying.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.062
Did he have to tie the thing
in like 900 knots?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.810
SCOTT: I'll do it.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.034
BOTH: Whoa!

19:27.250 --> 19:29.036
What the hell is that?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.959
- It's a wolf.
- Yeah. I can see that.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.963
I thought you said you smelled blood?
As in human blood?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.248
I told you something was different.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.297
- This doesn't make sense.
- We gotta get out of here.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.011
Yeah, okay, help me cover this up.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.759
- What's wrong?
- Do you see that flower?

19:49.105 --> 19:52.063
- What about it?
- I think it's wolfsbane.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.023
What's that?

19:55.528 --> 19:56.517
Haven't you ever seen "The Wolf Man?"

19:56.780 --> 19:57.610
No.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.105
Lon Chaney Jr? Claude Rains?

20:01.493 --> 20:03.029

20:03.244 --> 20:04.199
No, what?

20:05.580 --> 20:06.865
You are so unprepared for this.

20:48.957 --> 20:50.242

20:54.254 --> 20:55.334
Oh!

21:35.003 --> 21:36.083
(WHISPERS) No.

21:42.260 --> 21:45.218
Okay, just so you know,
I'm not afraid of you.

21:47.974 --> 21:52.764
Okay, maybe I am. Doesn't matter.
I just wanna know something.

21:52.979 --> 21:53.934
The girl you killed,

21:54.773 --> 21:56.058
she was a werewolf.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.352
She was a different kind, wasn't she?

21:58.610 --> 22:00.316
I mean, she can
turn herself into an actual wolf

22:00.528 --> 22:01.643
and I know Scott can't do that.

22:02.781 --> 22:03.816
Is that why you killed her?

22:05.074 --> 22:08.157
Why are you so worried about me
when it's your friend who's the problem?

22:08.411 --> 22:11.323
When he shifts on the field,
what do you think they're gonna do, huh?

22:11.581 --> 22:13.071
Just keep cheering him on?

22:13.583 --> 22:15.039
I can't stop him from playing, but you can.

22:17.170 --> 22:20.879

Uh-huh. Okay, well,
how about you help me understand

22:36.940 --> 22:38.521
exactly how you came across this.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.562
(SIGHS) We were looking for Scott's inhaler.

22:41.820 --> 22:42.650
Which he dropped when?

22:42.904 --> 22:43.734
The other night.

22:43.947 --> 22:44.777
The other night when you were out here

22:44.948 --> 22:45.778
looking for the first half of the body?

22:45.949 --> 22:46.779
Yes.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.198
The night that you told me
you were alone and Scott was at home?

22:49.452 --> 22:50.487
Yes.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.115
No. Oh, crap.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.320
So you lied to me?

22:54.791 --> 22:56.031
That depends on how you define lying.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.871
Well, I define it as not telling the truth.
How do you define it?

23:00.421 --> 23:04.255
Reclining your body
in a horizontal position?

23:04.592 --> 23:06.924
- Get the hell out of here.
- Absolutely.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.136
I can't find anything
about wolfsbane being used for burial.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.350
Just keep looking.

23:16.729 --> 23:20.563
Maybe, it's like a ritual or something.
Like, maybe they bury you as a wolf.

23:20.817 --> 23:21.772
Or maybe it's like a special skill.

23:21.943 --> 23:23.103
You know,
like something you have to learn.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.773

I'm playing this game tonight."

- Okay, stop it.

23:32.745 --> 23:33.609
Stop what?

23:33.872 --> 23:36.329
Stop saying "werewolves."
Stop enjoying this so much.

- Are you okay?
- No! .

23:38.710 --> 23:41.622
No, I'm not. I'm so far from being okay.
