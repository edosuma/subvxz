00:09.133 --> 00:11.200
- Where's Scott?
- Scott and Tyga have

00:11.200 --> 00:14.600
been hanging out at his house,
all day and night.

00:14.600 --> 00:18.333
I almost want to, like, call
Tyga and just literally go off

00:18.333 --> 00:22.067
- on him.
- But don't we kind of

00:22.067 --> 00:25.800
think it's a miracle?
That Rob wants to be so public

00:25.800 --> 00:28.100
- blows my mind.
- She gave him confidence.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.367
- More power to her.
- Am I happy he's out

00:31.367 --> 00:32.867
and about?
For sure.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.267
Am I disappointed that Rob isn't
talking to me?

00:35.267 --> 00:36.933
Yeah.
That's just where it gets

00:36.933 --> 00:39.967
frustrating.

00:43.900 --> 00:47.433
- Whoa, guys.
- How awesome is this?

00:47.433 --> 00:49.833
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hi, how you guys doing?

00:49.833 --> 00:51.167
- I'm Flip.
- Hi, how are you?

00:51.167 --> 00:52.567
- Khloe. Your name's Flip?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

00:52.567 --> 00:53.733
- Yes, ma'am.
- How cool!

00:53.733 --> 00:55.233
Thank you.
Are you scared of heights?

00:55.233 --> 00:56.833
- No.
- No? Are you sure?

00:56.833 --> 00:58.333
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I'm gonna test

00:58.333 --> 00:59.767
- that today.
- Okay.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.100
All right?

01:01.100 --> 01:02.500
You just come on over here.
Come on, bud.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.367
See if you can climb all the way
to the middle, Mase.

01:04.367 --> 01:06.367
- With your hands only.
- Khlo, take a

01:06.367 --> 01:08.600
picture of Mase.
I'm videotaping him.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.867
- Can I let go?
- Yeah, you can let go.

01:10.867 --> 01:12.500
There you go.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.900
Oh, my goodness.
Khlo, you have to do

01:14.900 --> 01:17.133
something... like, you just have
to jump off there.

01:17.133 --> 01:18.433
I don't like heights,
though.

01:18.433 --> 01:19.867
Yeah, go do it with
Mase; I'll do it with you.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.900
That gives you more of
a reason to do it.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.367
- Oh, my God.
- It's like, sorry, I

01:24.367 --> 01:26.500
- can't handle this.
- Mase, you gonna show

01:26.500 --> 01:29.367
them how to do it?
Go for it!

01:29.367 --> 01:32.433
- Oh!
- Three, two, one.

01:32.433 --> 01:35.000
Who would ever choose

01:35.000 --> 01:36.867
- to do this?
- KoKo, jump, okay?

01:36.867 --> 01:39.367
Come on, KoKo, you can do it.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.100
Oh, my, I literally
just...

01:41.100 --> 01:42.533
- Walk in.
- Just do it.

01:42.533 --> 01:47.800
One, two... Ah!

01:47.800 --> 01:49.267
- Just do it.
- KoKo!

01:49.267 --> 01:53.267
- I'll give you my 100 bucks!
- Stop pressuring me!

01:53.267 --> 01:55.400
- Here.
- Okay.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.400
Oh, my God, I just
can't do this.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.233
Stop pressuring...
Oh, my God, it's coming.

01:59.233 --> 02:01.967
Just go.

02:01.967 --> 02:04.033
Nice job!
That was an adrenaline rush,

02:04.033 --> 02:06.533
- huh?
- My sock!

02:25.567 --> 02:28.500
Khlo, your thing
doesn't work.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.467
I have chargers right
here.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.567
And it does.
One's a Blackberry.

02:32.567 --> 02:35.033
- I see one gray hair.
- On me?

02:35.033 --> 02:36.933
Yeah.
Like, a long, gray hair.

02:36.933 --> 02:40.400
Ooh, yes.
I love that. Where?

02:40.400 --> 02:41.867
- Right there.
- Don't pull it out.

02:41.867 --> 02:43.233
I'm not.
It makes you a little older,

02:43.233 --> 02:44.967
- though.
- That's okay.

02:44.967 --> 02:48.600
- I'm 36.
- It's crazy that I'm 35.

02:48.600 --> 02:53.167
So weird. I'm 28.

02:53.167 --> 02:56.533
- Is Rob 28?
- Who's Rob?

02:56.533 --> 02:58.800
- Good question.
- Good question.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.400
- Who's Rob?
- I think that Rob

03:03.400 --> 03:07.467
has his life with Chyna.
And I'm happy that Rob is at

03:07.467 --> 03:10.767
least getting out of the house
and living life, but I just hope

03:10.767 --> 03:13.767
that it will just get to the
place where he wants to hang out

03:13.767 --> 03:17.267
- with his family again.
- You guys, I wonder what

03:17.267 --> 03:20.233
my boobs are gonna look like
when I'm done breastfeeding.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.733
Years ago, I used to tape up my
boobs.

03:22.733 --> 03:25.867
This is 2009.
And I'm like, it is masking tape

03:25.867 --> 03:28.067
on another level, and now it's
duct tape.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.433
How do you take that
off? Does it kill?

03:29.433 --> 03:31.700
It kills.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.933
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

03:41.933 --> 03:44.267
- Do you want anything to drink?
- Uh...

03:44.267 --> 03:45.800
- Want a water?
- Sure.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.433
- That'd be great.
- I'll get it.

03:47.433 --> 03:52.600
So what was the last vacation
that you guys went on, with your

03:52.600 --> 03:54.633
- family?
- Well...

03:54.633 --> 03:56.167
Besides, you go to Palm
Springs all the time.

03:56.167 --> 03:58.000
I was just going to
say, Palm Springs.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.433
You know how we go on a

03:59.433 --> 04:01.833
family trip, you know, once or
twice a year?

04:01.833 --> 04:03.567
Mm-hmm.
- Nobody can ever decide

04:03.567 --> 04:08.500
where to go.
So I'm thinking Vail.

04:08.500 --> 04:13.033
Like, I have not been back to
Vail... in 20 years.

04:13.033 --> 04:15.867
- Our kids grew up in Vail.
- Don't make me cry.

04:15.867 --> 04:19.000
Oh...
Going to Vail on the family

04:19.000 --> 04:23.367
vacation is brilliant, because
that's where my kids and I, and

04:23.367 --> 04:27.333
their dad, spent most of their
childhood on every family

04:27.333 --> 04:30.233
vacation during the winter.
They were some of the happiest

04:30.233 --> 04:35.367
times of my family's life and
memories that we made that will

04:35.367 --> 04:38.700
last a lifetime.
And it's just the perfect place

04:38.700 --> 04:41.400
to take the family.
Remember that house we used to

04:41.400 --> 04:43.500
- stay in?
- Oh, God, yes.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.333
- The kids always looked so great.
- The outfits.

04:46.333 --> 04:47.733
- The Bogner outfits...
- The Bogner outfits.

04:47.733 --> 04:49.667
Oh, my...
Oh, my God.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.167
Lots of memories.
Lots of... lots and lots of

04:52.167 --> 04:55.400
- great, great memories.
- I would really like to

04:55.400 --> 04:57.700
not tell 'em.
Like, I'll surprise 'em.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.600
- Oh, my God.
- I'll get 'em to meet me

04:59.600 --> 05:01.667
at the airport.
I'll tell the pilots not to say

05:01.667 --> 05:04.433

what...

gonna take the kids on a
surprise vacation, and I would

05:45.700 --> 05:47.967
like to take you, because I
think you'd have a really good

05:47.967 --> 05:51.467
time.
Um, do you want to come?

05:51.467 --> 05:56.133

- Kourtney and the kids,

05:56.133 --> 06:01.733
Kanye and Kim, and Khloe and
Kendall and Kylie.

06:01.733 --> 06:04.267

- right?
- I don't think Tyga's

06:06.533 --> 06:08.833
gonna go, no.
He's not going.

06:08.833 --> 06:11.533
- And I just wanted to know...
- I don't want him to pop

06:11.533 --> 06:13.133

I'm just saying, it just puts me

06:13.133 --> 06:15.033
in a-a situation that...
- Yeah.

06:15.033 --> 06:16.433
He will not be popping
up.

06:16.433 --> 06:19.933
- It's just me and my kids.
- I got it.

06:19.933 --> 06:22.867
Uh, well, we'll see.
Uh, where are you guys going?

06:22.867 --> 06:25.400
- Can't tell you.
- I can't tell you,

06:25.400 --> 06:28.067
'cause it's a surprise, but it's
like a one-and-a-half-hour

06:28.067 --> 06:31.633
flight, and it's a walk down
memory lane, but I don't want

06:31.633 --> 06:34.433
you to say that to the girls,
because I'm not telling them

06:34.433 --> 06:38.633
even that.
Planning this family vacation is

06:38.633 --> 06:42.233
more difficult than it seems,
because of all the things that I

06:42.233 --> 06:45.633
have to navigate about who is
gonna show up.

06:45.633 --> 06:49.400
It's just a little crazy.
You would go with me, I promise

birthday."

Is it just the girls?

08:21.600 --> 08:24.033
No.
It's as many family members as

08:24.033 --> 08:26.533
we can pull together who want to
go.

a trip it is, and Scott wanted

- I'll be his nanny.

Is he gonna be...
Like, do I have to worry if he's

08:51.733 --> 08:54.500
- drinking?
- Okay, but if he's

08:54.500 --> 08:58.067
there, he's there with his kids,
having a good time.

08:58.067 --> 09:01.267
I think Scott should
come, poor guy.

09:01.267 --> 09:04.700

family trips, have definitely

09:04.700 --> 09:06.300

little bit more and a little

09:09.733 --> 09:11.433
- bit more.
- Don't worry about me.

Like, do you just write down all
the reasons to pick at Scott

09:14.100 --> 09:16.267
every day?
Yeah, I don't want to be here.

09:16.267 --> 09:18.833

kids.
Like, have a great time.

I would just say do it.
Especially, like, maybe Rob will

09:26.733 --> 09:32.400
feel more comfortable, if he
ever goes.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.500
We're not gonna tell
the passengers where we're

09:34.500 --> 09:35.967
- going.

No!

whole family.

09:46.967 --> 09:52.067

Don't use that word in front of
my daughter, please.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.667
- that word all day.
- Really?

10:07.667 --> 10:10.133
It's what he calls
the paparazzi.

10:10.133 --> 10:12.967
I just want to know if
Scott's definitely coming on the

10:12.967 --> 10:15.267

- I don't know.

10:15.267 --> 10:20.300
I just want to have fun without
having to worry about, you know,

somebody else.
Is T coming or not?

10:22.833 --> 10:24.133
Has anyone decided?

10:25.400 --> 10:28.933
He's not gonna come if
Rob's coming.

10:28.933 --> 10:31.933
If Tyga does come
on the family trip, there's

10:31.933 --> 10:36.100
definitely more of a chance of
Scott just going crazy.

10:36.100 --> 10:40.533
Hanging out with somebody that,
like, brings out certain

10:40.533 --> 10:44.300
behaviors in you, like, is also
a scary thing.

10:44.300 --> 10:47.433
I just remember how sad
last time was when he saw all

10:47.433 --> 10:50.500
having a good time on the family
vacation.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.067
That's called
consequences to your actions.

10:53.067 --> 10:55.800
But I still felt bad.
So what do you think?

10:55.800 --> 10:57.833
I'm leaning towards
yes.

10:57.833 --> 11:00.100
Great.
I'm gonna call him right now

11:00.100 --> 11:04.600
and invite him.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.733
- Hello?
- Hi!

11:06.733 --> 11:08.833
- Hi.
- How are you?

11:08.833 --> 11:10.633
Good, what are you
doing?

11:10.633 --> 11:12.967
Good, just standing
here with Kourtney having a

11:12.967 --> 11:15.233
- salad.
- I just said that I

11:15.233 --> 11:17.933
made a decision.
If you wanted to come on the

11:17.933 --> 11:21.933
family trip, but you just need
to keep it together, dude,

11:21.933 --> 11:25.600
and have a great time with your
kids and your family.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.533
Well, you got yourself
a deal, kid.

11:27.533 --> 11:30.600
- You got yourself a deal.
- You're gonna stay

11:30.600 --> 11:33.167
at a hotel right next door to
our hotel.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.300
- Just like you like it.
- That's not how I like

11:35.300 --> 11:38.100
- it, but okay.
- Scott really wants

11:38.100 --> 11:40.633
to go on this trip with the
kids.

11:40.633 --> 11:44.400
And I just, like, I don't know,
I just feel like it's a good

11:44.400 --> 11:48.567
opportunity to see if, like, he
can handle coming on family

11:48.567 --> 11:51.867
vacations.
If I never try, then, you know,

11:51.867 --> 11:54.200
- I'll never know.
- Perfect.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.300
- Okay, cool.
- All right, love you.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.600
Okay, love you guys,
bye.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.167
Okay, bye.
See, that wasn't hard.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.900
We're not gonna tell
the passengers where we're

12:09.900 --> 12:11.633
- going.
- I know, I know all

12:11.633 --> 12:15.133
about it.
It's a surprise.

12:15.133 --> 12:18.467
♪ Sister... ♪
Hi!

12:18.467 --> 12:20.167
- Welcome to the...
- Hi.

12:20.167 --> 12:22.000
Hi.
family trip.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.833
- Hi!
- Hi!

12:23.833 --> 12:25.133
Do you know where
we're going?

12:25.133 --> 12:27.600
- No.
- Today's the day that we

12:27.600 --> 12:31.233
go to Vail, and I am so excited
to surprise the kids.

12:31.233 --> 12:35.333
Get ready for the
adventure of a lifetime, okay?

12:35.333 --> 12:36.967
M'kay.
They still don't know where

12:36.967 --> 12:39.100
we're going and that makes me
really happy because I pulled it

12:39.100 --> 12:41.700
- off.
- Love you.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.600
Love you.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.900
You guys, where
should we all sit?

12:49.900 --> 12:52.667
Why don't we sit the
four of us here.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.367
- Okay.
- You, me, Kanye, and

12:54.367 --> 12:58.900
Scott.
And then kids can hang out here.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.367
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.

13:01.367 --> 13:02.900
- How are you?
- Good.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.633
- So, there's two planes?
- Yeah, the other one's

13:05.633 --> 13:07.500
- right there.
- Sister?

13:07.500 --> 13:11.433
- Sister!
- Whoa.

13:11.433 --> 13:13.233
Hey is, um, Rob
coming?

13:13.233 --> 13:15.767
Rob flaked.

13:15.767 --> 13:18.233
- You never texted him?
- Rob went to Kentucky.

13:18.233 --> 13:20.667
- Well, he was going to.
- He told me days ago he

13:20.667 --> 13:23.600
- was going to Kentucky.
- Wait, is this a joke?

13:23.600 --> 13:26.600
You know, I guess I could've
expected that my brother wasn't

13:26.600 --> 13:30.133
gonna come, but he's been so
good lately, and he's been,

13:30.133 --> 13:32.900
like, hanging out.
I just thought, like, maybe he

13:32.900 --> 13:34.833
would come.
I don't know, I think it's,

13:34.833 --> 13:37.933
like, so disappointing for my
mom since she worked so hard to

13:37.933 --> 13:40.700
get this trip together.
And it's just, like, I feel bad

13:40.700 --> 13:45.667
for my brother.
It's like too bad for you.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.267
Hurry up.

13:47.267 --> 13:48.933
Someone's here, you
guys.

13:48.933 --> 13:52.067
Who's here?
Somebody's knocking on the door.

13:52.067 --> 13:57.300
I have another surprise
for the kids.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.600
- Rob!
- It's just a different

13:59.600 --> 14:07.133
- dynamic when he's not around.
- We need you down here.

14:07.133 --> 14:09.033
Oh my God, now Rob's

14:09.033 --> 14:12.433
- not coming?
- Wait, what?

14:12.433 --> 14:17.567
- Are you serious?
- I am so disappointed.

14:17.567 --> 14:21.433
It makes me so sad that Rob's
not coming on the ski trip,

14:21.433 --> 14:26.767
and making yet another memory
without him truly breaks my

14:26.767 --> 14:29.467
heart.
And he's been doing so much

14:29.467 --> 14:32.433
better lately.
He gets a little bit better each

14:32.433 --> 14:36.700
and every day, and this would've
been so good for him, and just

14:36.700 --> 14:42.500
really great to connect with the
family again.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.533
I just invited T.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.533
- Tyga's coming?
- Oh, my God.

14:48.533 --> 14:51.167
I know Kourt is not
gonna be happy about Tyga

14:51.167 --> 14:54.767
joining the family trip, but I
don't want Kylie to feel upset,

14:54.767 --> 14:57.333
or disappointed.
At the end of the day these are

14:57.333 --> 15:01.667
Kourtney's issues, so I'm
staying out of this one.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.833
So, we don't know where we're
going 'cause Kris Jenner won't

15:03.833 --> 15:07.100
tell us, but, as long as the
sisters are together,

15:07.100 --> 15:09.233
♪ We're okay! ♪

15:09.233 --> 15:11.800
Running.
Running down the hall.

15:11.800 --> 15:12.900
- Good.
- "Running down the

15:12.900 --> 15:14.267
hall?"
Good.

15:14.267 --> 15:17.633
- Down the hall.
- I want the stupid

15:17.633 --> 15:20.367
jumbo jet.
I want that double decker.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.300
- I want the south...
- 747?

15:22.300 --> 15:24.367
- Double decker, yes.
- Like you could go

15:24.367 --> 15:26.467
- overseas...
- I need a 50-foot

15:26.467 --> 15:27.700
- screen in the jet.
- Yeah.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.067
I want the roller
coaster up in the jet.

15:29.067 --> 15:30.700
No, you got to have a
roller coaster.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.767
If you don't have a hot tub, you
ain't popping.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.267
Okay, so , we're going

15:34.267 --> 15:37.667
towards Middle America.
I feel like it's just Colorado.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.100
Why do you think we're
going to Colorado?

15:40.100 --> 15:42.533
I just said it to see
if you acted shady.

15:42.533 --> 15:45.467
And you're acting the
most shady with Colorado.

15:45.467 --> 15:49.400
- We might.
- Oh, we're landing

15:49.400 --> 15:51.100
- very fast.
- Don't look it up,

15:51.100 --> 15:53.200
- guys, don't ruin it.
- Who's gonna tell me

15:53.200 --> 15:55.233
- before I look at my map?
- Don't look at your

15:55.233 --> 15:58.267
maps!
It ruins all the fun.

15:58.267 --> 16:00.700
- Yeah, Kylie.
- We're in Vail.

16:00.700 --> 16:04.367
- Vail Valley.
- Vail Valley, it says

16:04.367 --> 16:07.233
Vail Valley!

16:07.233 --> 16:09.800
- Welcome to Vail.
- Vail, Utah!

16:09.800 --> 16:12.933
I am so excited to be

16:12.933 --> 16:15.400
here in Vail.
My dad used to take us to Vail

16:15.400 --> 16:18.100
every year for Thanksgiving
my entire life, and when he

16:18.100 --> 16:20.967
passed away, we have not been
back since.

16:20.967 --> 16:24.667
And I think it's so cute that my
mom brought us all here together

16:24.667 --> 16:27.233
- as a family.
- Welcome to Vail, kids!

16:27.233 --> 16:28.533
Have you guys ever
been to Vail?

16:28.533 --> 16:30.067
- No, never.
- Stop it.

16:30.067 --> 16:32.267
We're gonna have a walk down
memory lane.

16:32.267 --> 16:34.567
I've heard all about
Vail, and all the family stories

16:34.567 --> 16:36.933
about everyone going to Vail
because my sisters would go

16:36.933 --> 16:39.067
there all the time with my mom
and their dad.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.600
I've never been before.
It'll be awesome.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.867
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, have

16:41.867 --> 16:45.233
- nice time.
- Thank you.

16:45.233 --> 16:49.867
Hello, everybody.
Where are we?

16:49.867 --> 16:51.767
Kourtney, do you know
where you are?

16:51.767 --> 16:54.333
- We're in Colorado!
- Where?

16:54.333 --> 17:01.667
- Vail.
- Welcome to Vail!

17:01.667 --> 17:03.933
Thank you.
Oh, are Kim and

17:03.933 --> 17:06.867
- Kanye coming in here?
- Do you want me to go in

17:06.867 --> 17:11.300
- the back?
- I feel like we're on

17:11.300 --> 17:13.167
a road trip.
'Cause there's no, like, snow

17:13.167 --> 17:15.367
yet, it just feels very
road trip-y.

17:15.367 --> 17:19.767
- You good back there, Corey?
- Good and sleepy.

17:19.767 --> 17:23.300
Guys, look outside.
Get off your phones.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.767
All right, let's
look.

17:24.767 --> 17:26.867
- Please.
- I am, like, doe-hauling

17:26.867 --> 17:28.933
for Rocky Mountain Chocolate
Factory.

17:28.933 --> 17:31.000
Just let Mom
surprise us.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.133
I haven't missed a
thing.

17:33.133 --> 17:35.233
I don't know why I
didn't think of Vail.

17:35.233 --> 17:38.000
For some reason, this is not the
place that I thought my mom was

17:38.000 --> 17:40.333
planning.
It's gonna be so much fun to

17:40.333 --> 17:43.367
walk around and go to all the
places that we used to go to.

17:43.367 --> 17:46.367
And just to have, you know, my
husband there, and the kids all

17:46.367 --> 17:49.400
get hang out and ski together,
and do all the things that we

17:49.400 --> 17:52.000
did when we were little.
North is left-handed, and Kanye

17:52.000 --> 17:55.900
was left-handed, but his mom had
him change to right-handed, so

17:55.900 --> 17:57.967
he still--
I'm like the ultimate

17:57.967 --> 17:59.733
- example of a left-handed person.
- So are you

17:59.733 --> 18:01.333
ambidextrous?
Like, can you write with your

18:01.333 --> 18:03.200
- left?
- Not as well.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.933
- He goes both ways.
- No, I don't go both

18:05.933 --> 18:08.333
ways.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.467
Khloe, let's talk about your

18:10.467 --> 18:12.400
- accents.
- >> KHLOE:

18:12.400 --> 18:15.533
Kourtney, do you want a pink
, flamingo pink?

18:15.533 --> 18:18.367
- No, no, hot pink.
- Hot pink.

18:18.367 --> 18:20.367
- Ballerina pink...
- Let's

18:20.367 --> 18:22.400
- ask your followers.
- ...or gangrene.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
No, I want to know
from Kanye-- do you want a

18:24.400 --> 18:27.000
of choice?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.800
- Baby pink.
- It was baby pink,

18:28.800 --> 18:30.800
- hot pink or flourescent green?
- Baby pink-- Kanye wins

18:30.800 --> 18:32.800
- again!
- Baby pink.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.800
Ka... You know what
French said?

18:34.800 --> 18:37.900
- Hot pink!
- French said he wanted

18:37.900 --> 18:41.167
- a hot pink.
- Welcome to Vail, kids.

18:48.733 --> 18:53.600
Oh, look at this!
Welcome to Inspirato.

18:53.600 --> 18:58.167
Ooh, nice!
Look how beautiful!

18:58.167 --> 19:01.367
Hi, guys.
How are you?

19:01.367 --> 19:05.133
This is amazing.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.400
Oh, my God!
Look at the pictures!

19:07.400 --> 19:10.033
So cute!
The fact that my mom went

19:10.033 --> 19:13.233
the extra mile and put so
much effort into this trip and

19:13.233 --> 19:16.033
having my dad's pictures all
around the apartment, it just...

19:16.033 --> 19:18.933
Love is in the details, and my
mom showed us a lot of love.

19:18.933 --> 19:21.033
- Isn't this great?
- Look!

19:21.033 --> 19:23.033
- Hi, guys.
- There's pictures

19:23.033 --> 19:25.300
- everywhere.
- This is so cute!

19:25.300 --> 19:27.400
Yeah, Scott, look at
all the great pictures!

19:27.400 --> 19:30.433
They're of Dad and
everything.

19:30.433 --> 19:34.233
Look, Mase, look.
That was me and KiKi.

19:34.233 --> 19:37.567
- Look, that's Uncle Robbie.
- This is nice.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.500
- Mom!
- Yeah?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.500
I want to see the
snow.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.500
You want to see the
snow?

19:44.500 --> 19:47.000
You guys, how pretty
is this?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.867
- pretty.
- Oh, my God, guys!

19:48.867 --> 19:51.367
We're here.

19:51.367 --> 19:53.367
Isn't this good?
Look at this.

19:53.367 --> 19:55.667
- Look at the ice skating rink.
- Yes!

19:55.667 --> 19:59.433
Isn't that great?

19:59.433 --> 20:02.733
Why don't you go answer the
door?

20:02.733 --> 20:05.033
- Hurry up.
- Someone's here, you

20:05.033 --> 20:07.033
guys-- knock, knock...
- Who is here?

20:07.033 --> 20:11.433
Somebody's knocking on the door.
I have so many memories of Vail

20:11.433 --> 20:14.400
back in the day.
And I have another surprise for

20:14.400 --> 20:17.267
the kids at the door.
And I cannot wait to see their

20:17.267 --> 20:20.533
- reaction.
- What's happening?

20:20.533 --> 20:24.433
Surprise!

20:24.433 --> 20:29.333
Oh, my God!

20:29.333 --> 20:33.467
- How are you?
- Oh, my God!

20:33.467 --> 20:38.033
- Ooh!
- How are you?

20:38.033 --> 20:40.033
I'm so happy you're
here.

20:40.033 --> 20:42.033
- How you doing?
- Yo, baby!

20:42.033 --> 20:44.033
- Nice to see you.
- Great to see you.

20:44.033 --> 20:46.033
- Kris, aw!
- Hey!

20:46.033 --> 20:49.133
Every single trip that the kids
ever took to Vail on these

20:49.133 --> 20:51.500
wonderful vacations, they went
with the Kolkers and the

20:51.500 --> 20:55.300
Kraines, so I thought what an
amazing surprise if I invited

20:55.300 --> 20:59.600
them on the trip and we could
all share a reunion together.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.600
Now that you're here--
We're doing this 20

21:01.600 --> 21:04.467
years later, you know?
This is the 20-year reunion!

21:04.467 --> 21:06.467
- Before you were born.
- Yeah, I was gonna

21:06.467 --> 21:08.133
- say I wasn't born.
- They don't,

21:08.133 --> 21:09.567
- like, get it.
- No, you were not,

21:09.567 --> 21:11.267
- but...
- They don't get it.

21:11.267 --> 21:13.067
We used to come up
with, with Robert every single

21:13.067 --> 21:15.067
- year.
- They tell me all the

21:15.067 --> 21:17.067
- time.
- Will you say, "Hi,

21:17.067 --> 21:19.067
Auntie Kris, it's me, Todd
Kraines..."?

21:19.067 --> 21:21.067
Yeah, Scott, you got
to do it.

21:21.067 --> 21:24.233
What do you want me to

21:24.233 --> 21:26.233
- do?
- Just say, "It's me, Todd

21:26.233 --> 21:29.067
Kraines," and then I'm gonna go,
"And the real Todd Kraines."

21:29.067 --> 21:31.633
- Come on, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

21:31.633 --> 21:35.633
- One, two, three.
- Auntie Kris, it's me!

21:35.633 --> 21:38.733
- It's Todd Kraines!
- Oh, you better

21:38.733 --> 21:41.533
- believe it!
- You know, a long time

21:41.533 --> 21:44.567
ago, when we started prank
calling Kris with the whole Todd

21:44.567 --> 21:47.300
Kraines thing, I never even knew
who the person was.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.300
And then it became, like, an
on-going joke.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.300
You need to call
right now.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.300
Hello?

21:53.300 --> 21:56.033
Auntie Kris, it's me.
It's Todd Kraines.

21:56.033 --> 21:58.233
- Where are you?
- Stop calling this

21:58.233 --> 22:00.533
- number.
- Let's do a Todd

22:00.533 --> 22:03.367
Kraines prank.
Come on, Todd Kraines it up.

22:03.367 --> 22:06.100
It's me...
It's Todd Kraines!

22:06.100 --> 22:08.367
Surprise!
Auntie Kris, it's me.

22:08.367 --> 22:10.400
- Todd Kraines.
- It's me.

22:10.400 --> 22:14.367
It's Todd Kraines!
Auntie Kris, it's me!

22:14.367 --> 22:16.500
But I never thought I'd
actually, like, go on a ski trip

22:16.500 --> 22:19.233
with him.

22:19.233 --> 22:21.500
Auntie
Kris, it's me!

22:21.500 --> 22:23.633
- It's Todd Kraines!
- Perfect.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.633
Okay, so I wanted to
show you guys this.

22:25.633 --> 22:27.633
- Oh, wow.
- I put together a little

22:27.633 --> 22:30.400
walk down memory lane for you
guys.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.967
- Oh, wow.
- Look at you all...

22:32.967 --> 22:35.267
Oh, my God!
Look at the hair!

22:35.267 --> 22:37.667
You're gonna make me
cry.

22:37.667 --> 22:40.133
When we were, like, 14
and 15, we used to always say

22:40.133 --> 22:45.300
and 15, we used to always say
families and kids, we can never

22:45.300 --> 22:47.533
break this tradition of coming
to Vail.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.867
We have to come with our kids.
And so, the fact that my mom

22:50.867 --> 22:53.633
made that happen for us, it's
such a cool thing that we're

22:53.633 --> 22:56.900
- carrying on this tradition.
- Look at this-- baby Rob.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.033
I can't believe Rob
isn't here.

22:59.033 --> 23:01.033
Aw, we miss him so
much.

23:01.033 --> 23:03.433
Uh, that is the ugliest
picture I've ever seen of me.

23:11.633 --> 23:15.900
Let's touch the snow!

23:15.900 --> 23:18.533
Guys, stick a little
closer there.

23:18.533 --> 23:22.867
- Mase...
- Look at the river.

23:22.867 --> 23:25.233
- I can't see it.
- Look.

23:25.233 --> 23:28.300
You know, when Mom was little, I
took my Christmas card picture

23:28.300 --> 23:31.633
here with my daddy.
We stood on the bridge and we

23:31.633 --> 23:34.967
took a picture with Uncle Bob
and KoKo and KiKi.

23:34.967 --> 23:39.733
My best friend surprised me...

23:39.733 --> 23:42.167
- Hi!
- ...and is on our

23:42.167 --> 23:49.000
family vacation.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.333
Mason, let's put our
foot in the snow.

23:52.333 --> 23:56.633
Just for a minute...
I think the one thing I want to

23:56.633 --> 24:00.567
really get out of this trip is
that we can go places together

24:00.567 --> 24:04.400
and be a family even though
we're not dating or together.

24:04.400 --> 24:08.567
- The biggest snowball!
- And I just want her to

24:08.567 --> 24:12.167
- see that I'm fine.
- Let's go.

24:12.167 --> 24:14.233
All right, let's go,
girls.

24:14.233 --> 24:16.933
All right, Kourt, I'm
gonna go check into my hotel.

24:16.933 --> 24:28.100
Okay.♪ ♪

24:28.100 --> 24:30.700
- Ye, do you ski?
- I mean, I do ski...

24:30.700 --> 24:33.000
- Not today?
- I just feel like I'm

24:33.000 --> 24:35.867
- about to die every moment.
- Go show Daddy your

24:35.867 --> 24:37.867
- boots, North.
- Oh, there's are cool!

24:37.867 --> 24:39.733
Zoe's on her way
here.

24:39.733 --> 24:41.733
Are your boots
so heavy?

24:41.733 --> 24:44.133
- Are these boots so heavy?
- I grew up skiing and

24:44.133 --> 24:47.333
Kanye didn't.
And it's so fun having, like,

24:47.333 --> 24:50.533
Kanye be so excited, and we're
teaching our little girl how to

24:50.533 --> 24:53.967
ski, and you know, it really is
crazy.

24:53.967 --> 24:57.100
It's, like, I've envisioned this
since I was little of having

24:57.100 --> 24:59.867
these memories with my family,
and the fact that it's all

24:59.867 --> 25:02.000
happening is really special to
me.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.367
- We all made it!
- It's so hard to walk

25:05.367 --> 25:07.367
- in those, right?
- Yeah.

25:07.367 --> 25:09.033
- Hold my hand.
- Does that fit,

25:09.033 --> 25:10.367
- Mase?
- Kourt, what are--?

25:10.367 --> 25:12.100
Are we gonna watch the kids
or what?

25:12.100 --> 25:14.100
Yeah, let's watch
them for a sec and then go.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.100
We're gonna ski this
way.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.467
- We're gonna, let's go this way.
- You're doing it,

25:18.467 --> 25:21.733
Mase!

25:21.733 --> 25:24.633
You ready?
Go, put your arms out.

25:24.633 --> 25:28.367
Arms out for Dad.

25:28.367 --> 25:31.900
- Are we going?
- Yeah, let's go.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.933
- You did it.
- Bye, P!

25:33.933 --> 25:35.600
Wait, wait!
Tell my mom!

25:35.600 --> 25:37.633
- Bye, Mase!
- All right, we're not

25:37.633 --> 25:41.000
leaving them forever!
Bye, guys, bye! Bye!

25:41.000 --> 25:43.400
You'll probably never
see them again.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.733
Oh, P, bye!
Titanic,

25:46.733 --> 25:49.033
and they were getting on, like,
the little boat.

25:49.033 --> 25:51.133
Kanye's a really good
dad.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.700
Kanye has great family morals
and how he always wants us

25:53.700 --> 25:55.867
- together.
- Yeah, totally.

25:55.867 --> 25:58.467
Probably even wants
us, like, in the studio with

25:58.467 --> 26:00.733
him or, like, it's good, just
like, I love that.

26:00.733 --> 26:03.033
- Yeah, me, too.
- It's not at all how I

26:03.033 --> 26:05.533
ever imagined he would be.
You don't know when someone has

26:05.533 --> 26:07.933
- kids.
- Yeah, totally.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.433
And he has, like,
surprised me for the best.

26:10.433 --> 26:12.600
Where you wanna go,
Northy?

26:12.600 --> 26:14.767
Where you going?
You gonna make a snow angel

26:14.767 --> 26:19.667
like Daddy?
Here.

26:19.667 --> 26:24.933
Oh, I need a picture.

26:24.933 --> 26:28.867
Oh, is that too cute.

26:28.867 --> 26:32.600
You gonna help me up?
Ah, so much snow.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.267
Ah, it's snowing, it's snowing!

26:35.267 --> 26:37.867
It's snowing.
I love you, Northy.

26:37.867 --> 26:40.033
- Oh, where'd it go?
- Coming back!

27:04.300 --> 27:06.533
We used to yell
"Cowabunga" the whole time

27:06.533 --> 27:08.500
- skiing.
- I'll yell it with you.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.133
'Cause Ninja
Turtles were cool.

27:10.133 --> 27:12.133
Oh, good.
Well, Mason can do that now.

27:23.700 --> 27:26.933
Okay, who wants to go
to Sweet Basil?

27:26.933 --> 27:29.667
Hi, boo...
Oh!

27:29.667 --> 27:32.267
Yeah!
These hats are everything.

27:32.267 --> 27:33.833
- Where'd you get these hats?
- You look so cool, Mom.

27:33.833 --> 27:35.167
- Thank you.
- Khloe's.

27:35.167 --> 27:37.167
This outfit is from
1985.

27:37.167 --> 27:38.667
- Is it actually?
- Is it actually?

27:38.667 --> 27:40.000
- Yeah.
- Was it yours?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.700
Yeah.
I cannot button the pants.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.633
- You are so cool.
- Wait.

27:43.633 --> 27:46.567
Mom, you look like

27:46.567 --> 27:49.667
Elton John or something.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.667
Oh.
Let's go, we're gonna walk.

27:51.667 --> 27:55.233
Don't eat any more.
Sweet Basil is an amazing

27:55.233 --> 27:58.700
restaurant in Vail and it's one
of the places that we would come

27:58.700 --> 28:01.433
to every single time we would
come to Vail.

28:01.433 --> 28:04.267
And the kids continued to go
there through the years and I

28:04.267 --> 28:08.567
- think it'll be a great memory.
- Kourt, where's

28:08.567 --> 28:10.267
- Scott?
- He's coming.

28:10.267 --> 28:14.067
Cheers, babe.
There he is!

28:14.067 --> 28:18.800
Hey. Hey!
Want to say hi to your dad?

28:18.800 --> 28:21.700
- Oh, boy!
- Oh, my God, look at

28:21.700 --> 28:23.633
them taking selfies, you guys.
Look at them taking selfies

28:23.633 --> 28:25.000
- together.
- Yeah.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.967
I think... I think they're,
like, a little bit crushing.

28:26.967 --> 28:30.667
Scott's been great
on this trip so far, but I'm

28:30.667 --> 28:33.700
definitely a little nervous,
because I know how out of

28:33.700 --> 28:37.467
- control things can get.
- Why don't we do a toast?

28:37.467 --> 28:43.633
Thank you, Mom, for bringing us
all to Vail, our favorite, most

28:43.633 --> 28:49.333
memorable place in the world,
and surprising us with the

28:49.333 --> 28:53.200
Kraines and the Kolkers and
making it old-school, just like

28:53.200 --> 28:55.567
my dad would've wanted.
Thank you, Mom, for putting this

28:55.567 --> 28:57.133
- all together.
- I love you guys.

28:57.133 --> 28:58.533
- Love you.
- Cheers.

28:58.533 --> 29:00.167
Cheers, everybody.
Thank you, everyone, for being

29:00.167 --> 29:03.433
here.

29:03.433 --> 29:06.600
Let's call... Rob.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.067
Oh, look, he's gonna answer you.
Say "Hi, Bob."

29:09.067 --> 29:11.233
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, P!

29:11.233 --> 29:15.400
Oh, Rob!
We're at Sweet Basil.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.233
Are you drinking?
What are you drinking?

29:17.233 --> 29:19.233
- Tell him I said hi.
- Red wine.

29:19.233 --> 29:20.600
- Red wine.
- Red wine.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.033
- Bobby!
- And here's Todd

29:23.033 --> 29:24.900
Kraines.
Todd Kraines.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.233
Can I... can I say
hello?

29:26.233 --> 29:27.667
- Can we say hello?
- And Uncle Randy.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.033
- We miss you.
- Pull it.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.333
- Give it to Kanye.
- Just hop on a plane.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.967
- We need you down here.
- Get over here.

29:33.967 --> 29:35.767
- You need to come.
- I need to give you a

29:35.767 --> 29:37.267
- big hug.
- It's a family vacation.

29:37.267 --> 29:40.067
You need to, come on.
I'm serious.

29:40.067 --> 29:41.600
We have a whole room for
you.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.300
Hi, Bob.
I miss you.

29:44.300 --> 29:48.633
- I miss you.
- Rob, I think, definitely

29:48.633 --> 29:51.867
has some things that he has to
work out.

29:51.867 --> 29:55.133
We've always been a close
family, so it is just a

29:55.133 --> 29:57.533
different dynamic when he's not
around.

29:57.533 --> 30:00.000
It's just kind of sad.
We like him to, you know, have

30:00.000 --> 30:03.567
all these memories and live in
the moment with us.

30:03.567 --> 30:05.467
Love you.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.367
Have you spoken to
Kylie?

30:13.367 --> 30:16.067
- No, I haven't. Why?
- I guess, like, T's

30:16.067 --> 30:18.467
coming on the trip.
wasn't

30:18.467 --> 30:22.600
- coming.
- Rob is just a.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.733
Everyone's calling us,
asking if it's true, and we just

30:24.733 --> 30:27.267
don't know.
How does our own brother not

30:27.267 --> 30:29.700
tell us?

30:33.133 --> 30:36.867
- ♪ ♪- Hello, Kim!

This is a place that I used to
take my kids every time we went

to Vail, so it's really special,
because I took my kids and now

41:55.133 --> 41:57.200
'Cause we're not--
hello, we at least involved

41:57.200 --> 41:58.433
- everybody in our.
- Just be happy that

41:58.433 --> 42:02.767
- he's been exiting the house.
- It's not our  decision.

42:02.767 --> 42:05.633
I said, "It's God's plan, it's
not yours."

42:05.633 --> 42:10.433
My brother is the happiest I've
seen him in a long time, and I

42:10.433 --> 42:14.333
just hope that, like, everything
is genuine and sincere, and,

42:14.333 --> 42:17.600
like, that's all we can hope.
It's not up to us.

42:17.600 --> 42:21.933
And, so why cause any tension or
add any drama, like, we should

42:21.933 --> 42:24.200
just be happy for them.
It definitely...

42:24.200 --> 42:25.633
But I'm not being a
bitch.

42:25.633 --> 42:28.100
Like, I haven't even said
anything to him, how I feel

42:28.100 --> 42:31.133
about him, and how I think he's,
like, a lunatic.

42:31.133 --> 42:33.000
That's nice.
And that's exactly why he didn't

42:33.000 --> 42:36.567
tell you, 'cause you're a
bitch.

42:36.567 --> 42:39.733
We all are reacting
differently to this news, and as

42:39.733 --> 42:42.200
we should.
He never mentioned anything, not

42:42.200 --> 42:45.567
even, like, an inkling that this
was about to happen.

42:45.567 --> 42:48.600
Finding out on social media
leaves a really bad taste in my

42:48.600 --> 42:50.800
mouth.
All of us have always wanted

42:50.800 --> 42:53.433
the best for him.
Now that Rob has figured out

42:53.433 --> 42:57.833
where his happy is, instead of
sharing that with his family,

42:57.833 --> 43:01.867
he's, like, pushing us more away
and he just keeps doing things

43:01.867 --> 43:04.867
to keep this divide between us,
which I find disturbing.

43:04.867 --> 43:08.400
It's almost like there's someone
in his ear giving him all this

43:08.400 --> 43:11.133
information that he should stay
away from us, and I can't handle

43:11.133 --> 43:17.833
- it.
- That's  up.

43:17.833 --> 43:20.300
- Coming up next week...
- You all right?

43:20.300 --> 43:22.367
- Rob got engaged.
- Stop.

43:22.367 --> 43:24.933
I-I think I'm just in
shock.

43:24.933 --> 43:26.900
He has not spoken to any
of us.

43:26.900 --> 43:32.367
He must legitimately hate our
whole family.

43:32.367 --> 43:34.767
- Oh, yeah!
- I know Kourt had a ton

43:34.767 --> 43:36.700
of anxiety, but I could see
those nerves are completely

43:36.700 --> 43:38.700
leaving her.
There's no loyalty or

43:38.700 --> 43:40.867
or family unity with him.
Other people know more about our

43:40.867 --> 43:42.700
family than we know.
