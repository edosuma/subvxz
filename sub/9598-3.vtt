00:26.920 --> 00:29.388
- Chicken pox?
- No.

00:29.423 --> 00:30.489
Chlamydia?

00:30.524 --> 00:34.360
- Really?
- I'll take that as a "no."

00:34.394 --> 00:36.629
- Deep vein thrombosis?
- No.

00:36.696 --> 00:38.230
How about depression?

00:38.265 --> 00:40.766
Only since you started
asking me all these questions.

00:40.801 --> 00:43.536
Let me remind you that if
you'd gone to your regular O.B.,

00:43.570 --> 00:45.838
We wouldn't have to fill
out new-patient forms.

00:45.872 --> 00:47.840
Well, let me remind you my regular O.B.

00:47.874 --> 00:49.909
is two blocks from
the house I grew up in.

00:49.943 --> 00:54.246
The staff knows people in my
neighborhood, and people talk.

00:54.281 --> 00:56.248
I don't want Casey's mom
finding out about this pregnancy

00:56.283 --> 00:57.716
before I have a chance to tell him.

01:01.822 --> 01:05.324
Are you having second thoughts
about not marrying Casey?

01:05.391 --> 01:07.259
No.

01:07.294 --> 01:11.831
I mean, I love Casey, and
I know that he loves me.

01:11.865 --> 01:15.868
But we decided that marriage
isn't right for us now.

01:15.902 --> 01:18.370
Are you worried he won't understand?

01:18.405 --> 01:20.439
Yeah.

01:20.474 --> 01:22.675
I don't want to hurt him.

01:22.742 --> 01:25.945
You just need to talk to
him and speak from the heart.

01:27.414 --> 01:28.848
Yeah.

01:28.882 --> 01:31.250
Well, until I get it figured out,

01:31.284 --> 01:34.720
The only person that I trust
knowing about this pregnancy is you.

01:34.754 --> 01:39.291
You and this complete stranger
who will now be my O.B.-gyn.

01:39.326 --> 01:40.726
Uh, I...

01:40.760 --> 01:43.262
Otherwise, I just... I just
want to keep it a secret.

01:43.296 --> 01:44.563
Um...

01:49.669 --> 01:53.939
Your mom knows you're pregnant.
I'll wait in the car.

02:16.894 --> 02:19.542
<b>5x03 - "Too Good to Be True"</b>

02:21.868 --> 02:24.737
I didn't actually tell your mother.

02:24.771 --> 02:27.506
She somehow knew, and
then I confirmed it.

02:27.541 --> 02:29.742
I don't really even
know how it happened.

02:29.776 --> 02:33.546
- I am so sorry.
- She use the Latin thing on you?

02:33.580 --> 02:37.416
<i>Et non dico mendacium quaestiones?</i>

02:37.450 --> 02:39.018
Yeah, that's it.

02:39.052 --> 02:41.020
And then did she tell you
about her psychic grandmother

02:41.054 --> 02:43.856
and take your hand and say
that she could tell if you

02:43.857 --> 02:46.659
were lying just by running
her fingers across your palm?

02:48.028 --> 02:50.596
But it felt so real and honest.

02:50.664 --> 02:52.498
Her grandmother died when she was 5.

02:52.532 --> 02:55.968
- I'm such an idiot!
- No, no.

02:56.002 --> 02:58.537
You just fell for her
well-oiled routine.

02:58.572 --> 03:00.906
I mean, Frankie couldn't get
away with anything as a kid

03:00.941 --> 03:03.742
because she was always weaseling
a confession out of him.

03:03.777 --> 03:05.344
Sounds like a cop I know.

03:05.378 --> 03:08.447
Maybe the apple doesn't
fall too far from the tree.

03:08.481 --> 03:11.951
Was that a veiled reference to
my potential parenting style?

03:11.985 --> 03:14.086
I wouldn't call it "veiled."

03:15.922 --> 03:17.656
All right, well, let me handle this.

03:17.724 --> 03:19.592
I don't want her to make it about you.

03:19.626 --> 03:22.094
Don't let her use the Latin on you.

03:30.050 --> 03:31.584
What?

03:31.618 --> 03:32.885
Is there something you
want to ask me about?

03:32.953 --> 03:35.521
Why? No, no.
Is there something you want to tell me?

03:36.857 --> 03:38.491
What is it you think I know?

03:38.525 --> 03:40.392
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.528
Ma, I know you know.
I spoke to Maura.

03:42.562 --> 03:44.296
Ohhh!

03:44.331 --> 03:46.699
Thank you for finally telling me!

03:46.733 --> 03:50.579
I'm so happy for you, Jane.
I am so proud of you!

03:51.438 --> 03:54.840
- Thank you.
- So, what about you and Casey?

03:54.908 --> 03:57.476
We've already made a decision
about our relationship, okay?

03:57.511 --> 03:58.844
Jane, you have to have...

03:58.912 --> 04:01.046
Ma, this baby is my
responsibility, okay?

04:01.114 --> 04:02.781
Don't push the Casey thing.

04:04.117 --> 04:05.784
Okay, fine.

04:05.852 --> 04:09.622
- And don't tell anybody.
- Me?

04:09.689 --> 04:11.056
I'm serious, Ma, okay?

04:11.091 --> 04:13.058
If the department finds
out that I'm pregnant,

04:13.093 --> 04:14.693
I could be reassigned to desk duty.

04:14.728 --> 04:16.695
Okay, what's so bad about a desk job?

04:16.730 --> 04:20.065
- I like being a cop.
- You're about to be a mother, too.

04:25.505 --> 04:27.506
Today, I'm still just a cop.

04:35.749 --> 04:38.951
You know, that's not
exactly all-terrain footwear.

04:38.985 --> 04:42.354
Maybe we should have
sacrificed fashion for comfort.

04:42.422 --> 04:45.925
I'm getting my field boots resoled.
I'm fine.

04:45.959 --> 04:48.694
Yeah, "fine" and wincing
don't exactly go together.

04:48.728 --> 04:50.329
Well, my feet only hurt

04:50.363 --> 04:52.531
because I'm taking a new
yoga class to strengthen them.

04:52.566 --> 04:53.999
But I'm in a transition period,

04:54.034 --> 04:57.636
and soon, I'll be able to
wear any size heel anywhere.

04:57.671 --> 05:01.073
Lady Gaga will be so proud of you.

05:01.107 --> 05:02.575
What do we got?

05:02.609 --> 05:04.410
Park worker found him
this morning around 8:00.

05:04.444 --> 05:06.078
- Witnesses?
- No.

05:06.112 --> 05:07.947
There are two wounds...

05:08.014 --> 05:10.616
one to the ear with
significant tissue loss

05:10.650 --> 05:12.818
and an entrance wound to the chest.

05:12.852 --> 05:14.520
- So through and through?
- Maura: No.

05:14.588 --> 05:17.756
I feel it is likely a projectile
in the subcutaneous tissue.

05:17.791 --> 05:19.391
Shot alert picked up two shots...

05:19.426 --> 05:21.393
10:58, 10:59 last night.

05:21.428 --> 05:22.728
Well, given the stage of rigor mortis,

05:22.762 --> 05:24.096
that fits the window
for the time of death.

05:24.130 --> 05:26.098
I got Frankie setting up a line search.

05:26.132 --> 05:30.799
- Anything else?
- I've got footprints heading up the hill.

05:31.079 --> 05:34.740
- Yeah, two sets.
- And we have blood drops.

05:37.077 --> 05:39.545
Okay, so... he was shot

05:39.579 --> 05:43.115
and then took off running
with someone chasing him.

05:43.149 --> 05:48.053
- .30-30.
- And where's the other shell casing?

05:48.088 --> 05:49.688
Mm.

05:49.723 --> 05:50.823
Korsak.

05:55.562 --> 05:57.442
Who leaves a murder weapon
where we can find it?

05:57.464 --> 06:00.933
Somebody who thinks it doesn't matter.
I'll get CSRU to process it.

06:01.001 --> 06:03.068
What the hell was going
on up here last night?

06:03.103 --> 06:04.903
Well, the victim didn't have a wallet.

06:04.938 --> 06:06.538
It's a lot of work to steal a wallet.

06:06.573 --> 06:10.643
Maybe it was a sex crime,
drug deal gone wrong,

06:10.677 --> 06:12.578
random shooting.

06:12.612 --> 06:15.914
So, outside of an attack by aliens,
you're not willing to rule anything out?

06:15.949 --> 06:19.428
I won't even rule out the little
green men. They're a slippery bunch.

06:20.153 --> 06:23.022
You're gonna want to see what we found.

06:28.895 --> 06:30.863
You okay?

06:30.897 --> 06:33.666
Since when do I need help
walking through the woods?

06:33.733 --> 06:36.001
Can't a brother just
give his sister a hand?

06:36.036 --> 06:37.836
Yeah, if he wants to lose it.

06:43.877 --> 06:46.011
Does that look like
a fresh grave to you?

06:46.046 --> 06:47.046
Yep.

06:48.548 --> 06:50.926
Well, I guess we can scratch
one thing off your list.

06:51.718 --> 06:53.652
This wasn't random.

07:01.259 --> 07:03.894
Got a hit on the victim's fingerprints.

07:03.929 --> 07:06.764
He was in the army
reserve back in the '90s.

07:06.832 --> 07:09.400
Carl Ulrich, 37.

07:09.434 --> 07:14.739
Our victim was a steelworker,
but he lost his job six years ago.

07:14.773 --> 07:18.642
No vehicle registration, no
credit cards, no phone listing.

07:18.710 --> 07:20.644
His last known address
is five years old.

07:20.712 --> 07:22.046
Criminal record?

07:22.080 --> 07:23.114
This guy didn't even
have a parking ticket.

07:23.148 --> 07:24.648
Well, he only died yesterday,

07:24.683 --> 07:25.916
so he's been somewhere, doing something.

07:25.951 --> 07:27.151
Let's figure out what that was.

07:27.185 --> 07:28.185
All right.

07:34.209 --> 07:36.911
Someone didn't want you
finding this serial number.

07:36.945 --> 07:38.045
You changed the oil.

07:38.113 --> 07:39.780
I was working on an art project,

07:39.815 --> 07:41.248
and that's all I could
find at the hardware store.

07:41.283 --> 07:43.484
It actually mixes better
with the metal particles

07:43.518 --> 07:44.785
than what we were using before.

07:44.820 --> 07:45.886
Art project?

07:45.921 --> 07:50.224
I etched the bust and skyline
on a salvaged piece of flatiron.

07:50.258 --> 07:51.726
Then I filed it off.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.495
We're ready.
You can attach the magnets.

07:54.563 --> 07:59.133
Everyone thought I was trying to
make some statement on disposability,

07:59.167 --> 08:01.602
but when the tiny metal particles

08:01.637 --> 08:05.039
started to fill in the
imperceptible grooves...

08:05.073 --> 08:07.241
Voilса.
Cityscape.

08:07.275 --> 08:09.944
- Which was a statement on...?
- I just thought it was cool.

08:11.113 --> 08:12.880
I didn't know you were an artist.

08:12.914 --> 08:15.650
Before medical school, I
studied art in Paris for a year.

08:15.684 --> 08:18.185
So, tell me something
that'll surprise me

08:18.220 --> 08:20.721
about Sergeant Detective Vince Korsak.

08:22.824 --> 08:25.192
I cut an album before I was a cop.

08:25.227 --> 08:27.294
Look at that.

08:27.329 --> 08:29.930
A riddle wrapped inside of an enigma.

08:33.769 --> 08:36.904
Y...
You're standing on balls.

08:36.972 --> 08:38.673
They're massaging my feet.

08:38.707 --> 08:42.009
I have a simpler fix...
stop wearing high heels.

08:42.044 --> 08:44.178
Like I said, it's not from the heels.

08:44.212 --> 08:46.747
This is part of my new
strengthening regime.

08:46.782 --> 08:49.684
I e-mailed my yoga teacher
about my metatarsal discomfort,

08:49.718 --> 08:51.886
and she suggested knobby balls.

08:51.953 --> 08:53.320
Not even gonna go there.

08:53.355 --> 08:55.556
It's a spin on the
ancient Chinese practice

08:55.624 --> 08:57.501
- of walking on cobblestones.
- Mm-hmm.

08:57.533 --> 09:00.027
The balls... they connect with
the pressure points on my feet,

09:00.062 --> 09:01.929
which correspond to major organs.

09:01.963 --> 09:04.165
You should think about some
elements of Chinese medicine

09:04.232 --> 09:06.267
now that you're... pregnant.

09:08.136 --> 09:09.603
Thought about it. No.

09:09.638 --> 09:11.639
Well, at least you're
keeping an open mind.

09:11.707 --> 09:14.108
What do we know about ballistics?

09:14.142 --> 09:15.976
The bullet that I
removed from our victim

09:16.011 --> 09:17.978
was a .22 caliber.

09:18.013 --> 09:20.781
We found a .30-30 rifle
at the crime scene.

09:20.849 --> 09:23.250
Yeah, and our victim
nearly got his ear shot off

09:23.285 --> 09:26.887
by a large-caliber bullet consistent
with the rifle you recovered,

09:26.922 --> 09:28.622
but the fatal shot came from a .22.

09:28.657 --> 09:30.791
It entered his chest at
the second intercostal

09:30.826 --> 09:32.293
and nicked his subclavian artery.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.095
How long would it have
taken him to bleed out?

09:34.129 --> 09:36.997
The elevated heart rate from
adrenaline and physical exertion

09:37.032 --> 09:40.301
resulted in massive internal bleeding.
It happened very quickly.

09:40.335 --> 09:43.237
So... He ran himself to death?

09:43.271 --> 09:45.039
In a manner of speaking, yes.

09:45.073 --> 09:48.142
Also, while his jeans and
shirt were worn and frayed,

09:48.176 --> 09:50.377
they were also clean and ironed.

09:50.445 --> 09:53.614
And the even growth of his
hair indicates a recent haircut,

09:53.648 --> 09:55.950
and the work boots he
was wearing were new.

09:55.984 --> 09:58.986
So wherever he was going,
he dressed himself up a bit.

09:59.054 --> 09:59.820
What's that about?

09:59.855 --> 10:02.123
My life coach
always stresses the importance

10:02.124 --> 10:04.225
- of dressing for success.
- Usually, that's good advice.

10:04.259 --> 10:05.979
Susie raised the serial
number on the rifle.

10:05.994 --> 10:07.294
We also realized it was jammed,

10:07.329 --> 10:09.130
which is probably why
the killer dropped it.

10:09.164 --> 10:12.266
And the chase is why the
victim wasn't buried as planned.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.269
Let's run the serial
number through NCIC.

10:19.441 --> 10:22.843
- Did he say "life coach"?
- Don't ask.

10:26.047 --> 10:28.349
I found someone who worked
with Ulrich six years ago.

10:28.383 --> 10:31.152
He said he was a good
guy but kept to himself.

10:31.219 --> 10:33.454
Did he know what he'd been
doing since he lost his job?

10:33.488 --> 10:35.723
Someone on the plant floor
said that they saw him

10:35.791 --> 10:38.959
go into a soup kitchen near
the steelyard awhile back.

10:38.994 --> 10:40.761
Word was he lost his house

10:40.796 --> 10:42.276
and was living out of a storage unit.

10:42.297 --> 10:44.231
- Did you check it out?
- The unit was empty.

10:44.266 --> 10:46.267
Manager said he'd cleaned
it out two days ago.

10:46.301 --> 10:47.968
I also went to the soup kitchen.

10:48.036 --> 10:50.671
Minister told me that he'd
been in there last week.

10:50.705 --> 10:53.040
He was upbeat because
he just landed a new job.

10:53.074 --> 10:55.109
- Where?
- Minister didn't know.

10:56.511 --> 11:00.948
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

11:01.016 --> 11:03.083
Have a seat.

11:03.118 --> 11:06.387
- Thanks.
- Uh, decaf, right?

11:07.489 --> 11:10.024
- Frankie.
- Yeah?

11:10.058 --> 11:12.026
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

11:15.130 --> 11:19.133
Yes.
It's been killing me.

11:19.167 --> 11:21.402
Congratulations.

11:26.908 --> 11:28.709
Now I can stop being
nice to you for no reason.

11:28.743 --> 11:30.944
Oh, yeah. I wouldn't want
you to develop any bad habits.

11:30.946 --> 11:33.214
- How'd you find out?
- Ma.

11:34.282 --> 11:36.336
- Hello.
- Ma!

11:36.449 --> 11:38.919
You promised me that you
wouldn't say anything to anybody.

11:38.954 --> 11:43.457
Jane, Frankie isn't anybody.
He's your brother.

11:43.491 --> 11:45.326
Telling anybody would
be like blabbing it

11:45.360 --> 11:46.794
to a perfect stranger.

11:46.828 --> 11:49.296
Hey, you, did you hear me say anything

11:49.331 --> 11:51.198
about my daughter being pregnant?

11:51.233 --> 11:53.033
<i>Ni zai shuo shщnme?!</i>

11:53.101 --> 11:54.435
Mnh.

11:57.005 --> 12:00.274
- See?
- You have no idea what he just said.

12:00.308 --> 12:03.177
No, but did you hear him
say anything about... a baby?

12:04.312 --> 12:06.347
How do you argue with that?

12:06.381 --> 12:10.384
I'm warning you... one
word gets out about this,

12:10.418 --> 12:12.519
and I'm gonna name the
baby after Constantina.

12:12.554 --> 12:14.788
You are never to speak her name.

12:15.824 --> 12:16.924
Who's Constantina?

12:16.958 --> 12:18.559
- Her cousin.
- El diablo!

12:18.593 --> 12:23.297
- Why, you. You wouldn't dare.
- Boy or girl...

12:23.331 --> 12:26.433
Constantina Rizzoli.

12:26.468 --> 12:30.871
And now... I go to lunch.

12:30.939 --> 12:34.275
Have Ma fill you in
on old cousin Consty.

12:40.382 --> 12:43.668
- Hey.
- We got a hit on the rifle.

12:43.669 --> 12:45.419
It belongs to John Brooks,

12:45.453 --> 12:47.454
<i>a 39-year-old white
male with a record</i>

12:47.489 --> 12:49.857
<i>of drunk and disorderly
conduct and assault.</i>

12:49.891 --> 12:52.326
- We have a current address?
- Yeah, D street in Southie.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.861
I guess lunch will have to wait.

12:53.895 --> 12:55.529
Guess again.

12:55.563 --> 12:59.833
- That's the best reuben I've ever had.
- Also is with the meat.

12:59.868 --> 13:01.535
O'Malley's cures their own corned beef.

13:01.569 --> 13:04.204
Why do they call it corned beef?

13:04.239 --> 13:07.141
I mean, what's corn got to do with it?

13:10.512 --> 13:14.148
- That's John Brooks' car.
- And that looks like our guy.

13:23.425 --> 13:24.558
I got him.

13:26.361 --> 13:29.496
- Boston police.
- What the hell's going on?!

13:29.531 --> 13:32.499
- Are you John Brooks?
- No. I'm Ralph Comstock.

13:34.569 --> 13:36.503
That's what his license says.

13:36.571 --> 13:38.205
Why are you driving Brooks' car?

13:38.239 --> 13:40.107
We were roommates.
I bought it from him.

13:40.141 --> 13:42.509
I just, uh, haven't gotten
around to re-registering it.

13:42.544 --> 13:45.980
- Where is he?
- John? I don't have any idea.

13:46.014 --> 13:49.483
That's why I called you guys a year ago.
That's when he went missing.

13:56.786 --> 13:58.147
I'm telling you, John's no killer.

13:58.187 --> 14:00.389
Then how did his rifle
end up at a murder scene?

14:00.423 --> 14:03.490
I don't know. But I know John.

14:03.575 --> 14:05.743
We... we've been best
friends since we were kids.

14:05.811 --> 14:08.279
We grew up in Southie, played
Mighty Mites baseball together.

14:08.313 --> 14:10.414
Well, then, you know
about his criminal record.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.083
He's not exactly an altar boy.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.085
Sure, but that was
because of his drinking.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.821
He cleaned up his act way
before he went missing.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.355
So, what happened a year ago?

14:18.423 --> 14:23.427
John got a new job.
He was gonna be a caretaker on a farm.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.996
- Who was he working for?
- I don't know.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.433
- Where was the farm?
- I'm not sure.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.701
Ah, come on. You got
to do better than that.

14:30.735 --> 14:32.069
I wish I could.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.838
All I know is he answered
an ad on the internet.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.840
He interviewed, got the job,

14:35.874 --> 14:39.110
packed up all of his stuff...
his clothes, his tools.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.345
- His rifle?
- Everything.

14:41.379 --> 14:44.915
He even took our Mighty
Mites baseball trophy.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.184
Said it would remind
him of the good times.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.720
If he applied for a job online,
whose computer did he use?

14:49.754 --> 14:51.355
We shared an old laptop.

14:51.389 --> 14:53.057
Did he take it with him,
or do you still have it?

14:53.091 --> 14:54.425
I have it.

14:54.459 --> 14:56.861
I spilled coffee on the keys.
It fritzed up.

14:56.895 --> 14:58.195
We're gonna need to see that.

14:58.263 --> 15:00.364
Sure. It's in the
closet of my apartment.

15:00.398 --> 15:01.932
What else can you tell us about John?

15:04.202 --> 15:07.771
He loves dogs, pizza...

15:07.806 --> 15:10.341
hmm...
he's diabetic.

15:10.375 --> 15:13.344
<i>Look, I know he made some bad choices,</i>

15:13.378 --> 15:16.413
but I'm telling you, John
Brooks was a good guy.

15:16.448 --> 15:19.150
Whatever you think he did, you're wrong.

15:21.219 --> 15:23.320
<i>Korsak: Both these guys are similar.</i>

15:23.355 --> 15:25.923
<i>Both grew up in Southie,
both out of work.</i>

15:25.957 --> 15:28.893
Both down on their luck
when they find a new job.

15:28.927 --> 15:31.362
And then, one's dead and
the other goes missing.

15:31.396 --> 15:33.931
When did Ralph say that
Brooks went missing?

15:35.867 --> 15:38.169
March 23rd, last year.

15:39.208 --> 15:42.740
Shot alert recorded a single
gunshot near Blackstone Park.

15:42.774 --> 15:45.109
Unit responded but didn't find anything.

15:45.143 --> 15:46.343
It's a big park.

15:46.378 --> 15:49.180
I'll organize a team
to search it tomorrow.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.814
Alright. I guess that means
we're done for the day.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.350
Well, there is...

15:53.385 --> 15:54.952
one other thing we have to talk about.

15:59.057 --> 16:00.424
What's this?

16:00.458 --> 16:01.959
It's a file with the names
and the service records

16:01.993 --> 16:04.195
of potential replacements for Frost.

16:05.830 --> 16:08.499
- What?
- Brass gave it to me this morning.

16:10.936 --> 16:12.770
It's... it's too soon
to talk about this.

16:12.837 --> 16:15.039
Nobody's saying we have to
bring someone in right away.

16:15.073 --> 16:18.042
We can't replace him, Vince.
He's irreplaceable.

16:18.076 --> 16:20.978
I know. I know. I know.

16:21.012 --> 16:24.248
But... I've got orders
to begin the process, and...

16:24.282 --> 16:26.917
I wanted you to have some say in it.

16:28.286 --> 16:31.755
I'll go organize the
search for tomorrow.

16:49.307 --> 16:52.810
I can't believe that they
want to replace him already.

16:52.877 --> 16:54.411
I just think they don't want your job

16:54.446 --> 16:56.213
to be any harder than it already is.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.349
Yeah, but replacing Frost
isn't gonna help that.

16:58.383 --> 17:00.417
No, but a bureaucracy can't know that.

17:03.288 --> 17:06.423
- I just miss him so much.
- I know.

17:08.326 --> 17:10.327
You know, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to dump this on you.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.930
- I know you're sad, too.
- It's okay.

17:16.635 --> 17:19.369
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi.

17:19.404 --> 17:23.473
- What's going on?
- Well, uh, we were gonna go to dinner

17:23.508 --> 17:25.876
and wanted to know if
you wanted to join us.

17:27.512 --> 17:30.047
Ma told you I was back in A.A.?

17:30.081 --> 17:32.583
Yeah.
I'm really proud of you.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.587
That the only reason you came by?

17:39.057 --> 17:41.025
And I figured
she told you I was pregnant.

17:41.059 --> 17:45.929
- My big sister's gonna have a baby!
- It's so exciting.

17:45.964 --> 17:49.400
- Yeah. "Exciting."
- Oh, the first thing we got to get you

17:49.434 --> 17:52.236
is the tough love carrier.
It's waterproof, which is key,

17:52.304 --> 17:54.571
'cause little ones are
pooping and peeing machines.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.240
Mm-hmm.

17:56.308 --> 17:58.942
No, what I need is... is
for you to keep this quiet.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.577
Yeah, absolutely.
No problem. Totally get it.

18:00.612 --> 18:01.879
Thank you.

18:01.913 --> 18:04.415
Hey, everyone, this is Jane.

18:04.449 --> 18:08.252
Oh!
Congratulations on the baby.

18:10.121 --> 18:13.057
- Thanks.
- Bye, Judy.

18:13.124 --> 18:15.225
Is there anyone in
Boston you haven't told?

18:15.260 --> 18:18.262
Don't worry.
Everything in A.A. is confidential.

18:19.564 --> 18:20.664
Let's get something to eat.

18:20.699 --> 18:23.434
- Yes. Let's.
- Yes.

18:23.468 --> 18:25.669
So, did you have any trouble

18:25.737 --> 18:28.405
with the collapsible triggers
on the jogging stroller?

18:28.473 --> 18:30.908
Oh, instructions on all
baby gear is impossible.

18:30.942 --> 18:32.443
You just got to take your time

18:32.510 --> 18:34.411
and have a good Swedish
dictionary handy.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.612
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.082
<i>- I don't know any Swedish.
- Me neither.</i>

18:44.456 --> 18:47.224
- What's the word?
- Corrupted.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.259
The hard drive is fried.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.428
All we've been able to
retrieve is a photo of a farm

18:51.496 --> 18:53.697
that we think was connected
to an ad for the job.

18:53.732 --> 18:56.200
Trouble is, we don't know
if Brooks created the ad.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.035
He could have just been answering it.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.943
All right, well, let's analyze the
photo, see if we can locate the farm.

19:01.005 --> 19:03.073
Maybe that'll help us I.D. the killer.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.341
<i>Maura: Oh, my god!</i>

19:04.376 --> 19:07.244
Is that what you call a breakfast?

19:07.278 --> 19:10.180
- No... not without coffee.
- May I please see the package?

19:15.387 --> 19:18.422
- Do you know what's in here?
- Yummy goodness?

19:18.456 --> 19:21.492
Calcium carbonate.
Does that sound yummy?

19:21.526 --> 19:24.762
It comes from rocks.
Oh!

19:24.796 --> 19:27.765
Sodium stearate... that's used in soap.

19:27.799 --> 19:31.068
And do you know where you
can find titanium dioxide?

19:32.704 --> 19:33.771
Right there.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.439
Latex paint.

19:35.473 --> 19:38.142
Do industrial chemicals
sound like a good thing

19:38.176 --> 19:41.478
- to be putting in your body?
- Not anymore.

19:48.586 --> 19:51.021
Hey, Korsak.
<i>Buzzkill.</i>

19:52.424 --> 19:55.359
Well, she's right here.
Okay, we'll be right there.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.429
I am not a buzzkill.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.336
Nutrition's more
important now than ever.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.338
The first trimester is the most critical

20:08.373 --> 20:10.407
in terms of the
development of the organs,

20:10.475 --> 20:13.043
the nervous system, the
arms, the fingers, legs, toes.

20:13.077 --> 20:16.180
I was just eating a cupcake.
I didn't mean it as a hostile act.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.217
Euggggh.

20:20.251 --> 20:22.052
Korsak: Can you tell how
long he's been in the ground?

20:22.086 --> 20:24.188
I can't be certain until
I examine the remains.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.223
Maura, "approximately"
isn't gonna hurt you.

20:26.257 --> 20:27.825
Science is not a guessing game.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.393
You want me to get another cupcake?

20:30.628 --> 20:34.531
- A year or more is likely.
- What's that by his wrist?

20:42.707 --> 20:45.409
Diabetes bracelet.

20:47.145 --> 20:49.246
Well, now we know John
Brooks didn't go missing.

20:50.348 --> 20:52.749
All this poor guy wanted was a job.

20:52.784 --> 20:55.319
This is what he got instead.

21:03.904 --> 21:05.271
Hey. Anything new?

21:05.306 --> 21:06.740
No. We searched the hell
out of the internet.

21:06.774 --> 21:09.409
We found an ad with the same
farm photo on two other websites.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.977
Did you I.D. who placed the ad?

21:11.011 --> 21:13.513
Guy used a fake name and paid
for his bill with bitcoins.

21:13.547 --> 21:14.814
What about I.P. addresses?

21:14.849 --> 21:15.915
Back to internet cafщs.

21:15.950 --> 21:19.819
- Looks like the ad's a dead end.
- Well, the photo isn't.

21:22.323 --> 21:26.292
Susie identified those
as fraxinus quadrangus.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.629
- English?
- The trees... blue ash.

21:29.663 --> 21:32.432
They're found almost
exclusively in Western Ohio.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.401
Did you get an address?

21:34.435 --> 21:35.702
No.

21:36.704 --> 21:39.472
<i>But we found a highway
number... Route 422.</i>

21:39.507 --> 21:42.442
- Runs East/West.
- I'm guessing through Western Ohio.

21:42.476 --> 21:43.476
Yeah.

21:46.313 --> 21:49.015
This landmass matches
something called Campbell Hill.

21:49.049 --> 21:51.551
Which I bet is also in Western Ohio.

21:51.585 --> 21:52.852
Mm-hmm.

21:55.423 --> 21:58.758
This storage facility has
been there for 15 years.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.463
Well, if the farm no longer
exists, the ad is a fake.

22:03.497 --> 22:06.499
Just a way to lure out men looking
for work in order to kill them.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.368
We found that ad in multiple places,

22:08.402 --> 22:10.970
which could mean the killer has
attempted this several times.

22:11.005 --> 22:13.673
I'll run the profile through
NCIC for similar crimes.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.743
I'll dig into the farm.
Maybe our killer is connected to it.

22:16.777 --> 22:19.018
Let's hope so. Might be the
only way we have to find him.

22:25.052 --> 22:29.589
Dental records confirmed...
this is John Brooks.

22:29.623 --> 22:31.958
Single gunshot wound
through the occipital region

22:31.992 --> 22:33.626
with a large-caliber bullet.

22:33.661 --> 22:35.462
Like one from the gun we
found at the first crime scene?

22:35.496 --> 22:36.696
Certainly possible.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.131
I don't know if "irony"
is the right word

22:38.165 --> 22:40.790
for getting killed with your own gun.

22:41.135 --> 22:42.735
What can I do for you, sergeant?

22:42.770 --> 22:46.573
I ran an NCIC search on unsolved
murders that match our victims...

22:46.607 --> 22:49.108
urban areas, unemployed men
between the ages of 25 and 40.

22:49.143 --> 22:51.478
Well, I suspect that
yielded a plethora of hits.

22:51.512 --> 22:53.746
I'll be retired
before I get through them all.

22:53.781 --> 22:56.015
I was hoping maybe you could
help me narrow my search.

22:56.050 --> 22:57.784
We only have two data points.

22:57.852 --> 22:58.952
Well, do the best you can.

23:03.023 --> 23:08.495
The killer is taking the victims
away from where they live.

23:08.529 --> 23:11.798
He's stealing their wallets, their
identities, and burying them...

23:11.832 --> 23:15.468
not only, I suspect, to ensure
that he gets away with the crimes,

23:15.503 --> 23:17.470
but also to make them anonymous.

23:17.505 --> 23:18.938
Okay.

23:18.973 --> 23:21.708
I'm not a psychiatrist,
so it wouldn't be ethical

23:21.742 --> 23:23.877
for me to make a clinical diagnosis.

23:23.911 --> 23:26.846
But hypothetically, I'd say...

23:26.914 --> 23:28.848
he's a malignant narcissist...

23:28.916 --> 23:31.918
unable to empathize,

23:31.952 --> 23:35.788
only investing emotionally
in things he can control.

23:35.823 --> 23:38.725
- Like our victims' destinies.
- Yes.

23:38.792 --> 23:42.395
And to him, these victims are
worthless, as he himself feels.

23:42.463 --> 23:45.098
- He strips them of everything.
- Even the dignity

23:45.132 --> 23:47.100
for their loved ones to
know that they're dead.

23:50.971 --> 23:54.874
I would do a search
and include John Does

23:54.909 --> 23:57.076
whose bodies have never
been claimed by family.

23:57.111 --> 23:59.445
Thanks, doc.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.648
I knew there was a
reason I come down here.

24:01.682 --> 24:03.683
Anytime, sergeant.

24:11.191 --> 24:13.726
The only trace evidence
we found on Brooks' remains

24:13.761 --> 24:15.094
is a single, long, gray hair.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.597
Well, that obviously
didn't come from the victim.

24:17.631 --> 24:19.849
No, but if it came from
the killer, that would

24:19.850 --> 24:22.368
make him a middle-aged
male with long, gray hair.

24:23.137 --> 24:25.104
Thanks for going out on a limb.

24:25.139 --> 24:27.507
Well, a Llama seemed unlikely.

24:30.578 --> 24:34.781
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

24:36.951 --> 24:39.752
- No.
- Want to talk about it?

24:42.590 --> 24:43.990
I just... I feel like

24:44.058 --> 24:47.193
I finally got everything
settled with Casey...

24:47.227 --> 24:49.228
you know, about our lives,
our... our marriage.

24:49.263 --> 24:50.897
- You did.
- Right.

24:50.931 --> 24:54.000
But now that I'm
pregnant with his child,

24:54.034 --> 24:56.235
it just makes it so
much more complicated.

24:56.303 --> 24:57.937
I know.

24:57.972 --> 25:00.173
I mean, even the way I
tell him seems difficult.

25:00.207 --> 25:04.110
Do I e-mail him or...
or call or Skype?

25:04.178 --> 25:06.179
And how is he gonna
react when I tell him

25:06.213 --> 25:08.047
that I intend on raising
this child without him?

25:08.082 --> 25:09.749
Is he gonna be mad?
Is he gonna be hurt?

25:09.817 --> 25:11.284
Is... is he gonna fight me?

25:11.318 --> 25:15.788
- Is he gonna come running back?
- You know, it's overwhelming,

25:17.791 --> 25:21.761
But, uh, you don't have to rush it.

25:21.795 --> 25:23.997
You know, you can talk
to him when you're ready.

25:24.031 --> 25:28.901
Yeah.
Except that he contacted me...

25:28.936 --> 25:32.205
and he wants to talk... tonight.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.073
Oh.

25:36.810 --> 25:39.646
- Hey.
- I reran the NCIC search

25:39.680 --> 25:41.814
and found several murders
that fit our profile.

25:41.849 --> 25:43.950
They go from Columbus
to Pittsburgh to Boston.

25:44.018 --> 25:47.654
There's a direct line from that
farm in Ohio to our backyard.

25:47.688 --> 25:50.223
What's the most recent case?

25:50.257 --> 25:53.626
<i>Korsak: The unsolved murder of
a 31-year-old, unemployed man.</i>

25:53.694 --> 25:56.262
<i>His body was found in the woods
near a rest stop 18 months ago.</i>

25:56.296 --> 25:58.698
Let me guess... shot
in the back of the head.

25:58.732 --> 25:59.932
Yep. And get this.

25:59.967 --> 26:02.702
He left a message for his landlord
the day before he disappeared

26:02.736 --> 26:05.271
saying that he just landed
a great job at a farm.

26:06.573 --> 26:07.974
What about his belongings?

26:08.008 --> 26:11.678
All his stuff, including his 2004
green Ford pickup, still missing.

26:11.712 --> 26:15.148
What if these crimes are just
old-fashioned robbery/homicides?

26:15.182 --> 26:17.016
None of these guys are that well off.

26:17.084 --> 26:18.804
But their stuff can be
easily liquidated...

26:18.819 --> 26:21.187
I mean, tools, guns, trucks.

26:21.221 --> 26:23.890
What's a 2004 Ford pickup
truck go for these days?

26:24.725 --> 26:26.259
10, 11 grand.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.760
Well, that's a lot more than
you get in a bank robbery.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.356
And the killer is anonymous to everyone

26:29.363 --> 26:30.897
except the person he's
pretending to hire.

26:30.931 --> 26:32.999
Mm-hmm. And that person
has no connections.

26:33.033 --> 26:36.235
You know what? Maybe it's
time we applied for a new job.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.705
We should answer that internet ad.

26:38.739 --> 26:41.174
Yes.
I will, uh, pick a job application.

26:41.241 --> 26:43.643
Oh, I got it.
Why don't you call it a day?

26:46.413 --> 26:49.215
- What are you talking about?
- I'll do the application.

26:49.283 --> 26:50.616
I've got something
else to do here tonight.

26:50.651 --> 26:51.751
I was gonna stay anyway.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.319
<i>Go. Get some rest.</i>

26:55.656 --> 26:58.124
Okay. Uh...

26:58.158 --> 26:59.759
Okay.

26:59.793 --> 27:02.328
I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

27:06.900 --> 27:11.404
"I'm a 32-year-old, single,
former construction worker

27:11.438 --> 27:13.306
looking for a new lease on life."

27:13.340 --> 27:14.907
Blah, blah, blah.

27:14.942 --> 27:16.976
"mechanically inclined...
Have my own tools."

27:17.044 --> 27:20.646
That's good.
I would maybe just make the time spent

27:20.714 --> 27:24.172
at your previous job shorter
so it seems like you bounced around.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.452
Great.
I also thought I would add that

27:26.453 --> 27:29.188
my father recently passed away
and I have no other relations.

27:29.223 --> 27:32.825
I suspect that would be
very appealing to our killer.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.728
- What? No heels?
- Cramps.

27:35.763 --> 27:37.630
Long story.

27:37.698 --> 27:38.698
But don't tell Jane.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.670
- Is everything okay with her?
- Why?

27:44.705 --> 27:46.672
Well, I mean, I know she's
taken Frost's death hard,

27:46.707 --> 27:49.408
but it seems like there's
something else bothering her.

27:49.443 --> 27:53.446
- You're a very nice man.
- Is there anything I can do?

27:53.480 --> 27:55.281
I think you're doing it already.

28:05.025 --> 28:06.225
Hey, Maura.

28:07.961 --> 28:10.830
Yes, I-I took your advice,
and I wrote down notes

28:10.864 --> 28:14.934
to direct the conversation
in a focused way.

28:14.968 --> 28:17.970
Really?
Okay, fine. I'll read them to you.

28:18.005 --> 28:21.874
Okay.
Baby... yes.

28:21.942 --> 28:24.944
Us married...
still no.

28:24.978 --> 28:29.282
Raising child...
just me.

28:29.316 --> 28:33.386
His role... uh...
I don't know.

28:33.453 --> 28:37.890
Something about understanding
and arm wrestling.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.293
I'm kidding.

28:42.129 --> 28:44.997
Yeah, no, no. It's...
it's gonna go great, don't you think?

28:47.167 --> 28:50.136
Okay, um... Maura, I got to go.

28:50.170 --> 28:52.004
This is him.

28:52.039 --> 28:55.041
Okay.
I hope so, too. Thanks.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.350
Hey, Casey.

29:14.888 --> 29:19.725
- So? How'd it go with Casey?
- Fine.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.728
Can you be a little bit
more specific than "fine"?

29:22.763 --> 29:25.098
I mean, what can I tell you?

29:25.132 --> 29:27.467
It... it... it went fine.

29:27.501 --> 29:30.570
Okay. How did he react when
you told him you were pregnant?

29:30.604 --> 29:35.641
He was surprised.
Um... but he understood

29:35.676 --> 29:37.810
that that's not a reason
to get married, so...

29:37.845 --> 29:40.446
And what about your plans
to raise a child on your own?

29:40.481 --> 29:42.482
We're gonna figure out
his level of involvement

29:42.516 --> 29:46.486
once he's had a chance to
digest all the information.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.921
Well, that sounds like it
went better than "fine."

29:48.989 --> 29:51.057
I don't know what
more you could ask for.

29:51.091 --> 29:52.771
Yeah. No, you're right. You're right.

29:52.806 --> 29:55.928
So, why aren't you more relieved?

29:55.963 --> 29:58.931
Because when I was
finished dealing with Casey,

29:58.966 --> 30:01.767
the thought of having a baby

30:01.802 --> 30:04.820
just hit me like a freight train.

30:05.873 --> 30:07.907
I'm... I'm scared, Maura.

30:07.941 --> 30:11.711
Of course you're scared.
That's how you're supposed to feel.

30:11.745 --> 30:14.614
There's the support I was looking for.

30:14.648 --> 30:19.685
Okay, nothing about giving birth
or raising children is easy.

30:19.720 --> 30:23.623
You and your brothers caused
me a whole bunch of trouble.

30:23.657 --> 30:27.760
But I wouldn't trade it for a minute!

30:27.794 --> 30:30.496
Because you've been my greatest joy!

30:31.932 --> 30:36.002
And your child will do the same for you.

30:36.036 --> 30:40.139
Fear is normal.
Keeps us on our toes.

30:40.174 --> 30:41.707
Thanks, Ma.

30:42.976 --> 30:45.444
What kind of problems could
I have possibly caused you?

30:45.479 --> 30:46.979
Don't get me started.

30:48.749 --> 30:50.816
Oh, please... start.

30:50.851 --> 30:55.054
She threw a football through
Mr. Mac's front window.

30:55.122 --> 30:57.557
- That was Tommy.
- You made him.

30:57.591 --> 30:59.625
She didn't come home on prom night.

30:59.693 --> 31:02.528
- Oh!
- Well, that was a misunderstanding.

31:02.596 --> 31:05.498
- Okay.
- She duct-taped Frankie

31:05.499 --> 31:08.401
- to a chair for laughs.
- That was funny.

31:08.468 --> 31:09.936
That poor boy still jumps

31:09.970 --> 31:12.538
every time he hears
that "chkkkk!" sound.

31:13.774 --> 31:16.676
You were bad, Jane.
She was bad.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.084
I've been waiting for you.

31:25.118 --> 31:27.920
Did you get a reply
to my job application?

31:27.955 --> 31:31.123
We got an automated response
that the job had been filled.

31:31.158 --> 31:34.660
- Then why are you smiling?
- Because I started thinking...

31:34.695 --> 31:36.729
if we got an automated response,

31:36.797 --> 31:39.031
maybe the other guys who
applied got the same thing.

31:39.066 --> 31:41.067
I like where this is going.

31:41.101 --> 31:43.636
So I contacted the website
and got the e-mail addresses

31:43.670 --> 31:46.872
of the other men who received
the same automated response.

31:46.907 --> 31:48.741
You think one of them may have
interacted with the killer?

31:48.775 --> 31:50.743
Mm-hmm.
One actually met for the job.

31:50.777 --> 31:52.912
And he's waiting in the
interview room right now.

31:52.946 --> 31:55.972
Early bird, meet worm.

31:57.117 --> 32:00.052
I answered the ad and, uh, got
a reply from this guy... Greg.

32:00.087 --> 32:03.522
- We met at a diner for the interview.
- Did you get his last name?

32:03.557 --> 32:05.958
- No.
- What can you tell us about him?

32:06.026 --> 32:07.226
Seemed like a good guy.

32:07.261 --> 32:09.495
We both liked bikes...
bonded over Harleys.

32:09.529 --> 32:12.064
- What kind of Harley you got?
- '77 Electra Glide.

32:12.099 --> 32:14.834
1,200cc shovelhead. Nice ride.

32:14.868 --> 32:18.170
- I bet Greg liked the bike.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

32:18.205 --> 32:19.939
And he was impressed, too, you know,

32:19.973 --> 32:21.774
that even through all the hard times,

32:21.808 --> 32:23.209
I found a way to hang on to it.

32:23.243 --> 32:25.077
Well, sounds like you
two really hit it off.

32:25.112 --> 32:27.680
- We did.
- Well, why didn't you get the job?

32:29.182 --> 32:31.851
He, uh, he got pissed when he
found out I had a girlfriend.

32:31.885 --> 32:34.053
I hadn't mentioned
that on the application.

32:34.087 --> 32:35.521
What did Greg look like?

32:35.555 --> 32:39.792
White guy, mid-50s, big...
maybe 6'5",

32:39.860 --> 32:42.495
long, gray hair pulled
back in a ponytail.

32:42.529 --> 32:43.562
Where did you meet him?

32:44.965 --> 32:46.699
Bayview diner in Southie.

32:49.169 --> 32:51.804
- Frankie's looking for us.
- Okay.

32:51.838 --> 32:52.838
Thank you very much, Steve.

32:52.873 --> 32:54.874
So, what did this guy do?

32:54.908 --> 32:58.878
Well, let's just say you're lucky
this is the one job you didn't get.

32:59.914 --> 33:02.715
I sent the photo to the local sheriff
where the farm was located.

33:02.749 --> 33:05.017
He remembers the family that
owned the place, the Danielsons.

33:05.085 --> 33:07.119
According to bankruptcy records,

33:07.154 --> 33:09.889
the dad, Harry, lost
it to the bank in 1984.

33:09.923 --> 33:13.559
- You think Harry's our killer?
- No. He's deceased.

33:13.593 --> 33:18.130
- But his son, Greg, might be.
- Korsak: Description matches.

33:18.165 --> 33:21.600
And Greg seems to have dropped
off the radar in the late '90s.

33:21.635 --> 33:23.236
That's about the time the murders began.

33:23.270 --> 33:25.971
- Yeah.
- Jane, you thinking what I'm thinking?

33:26.006 --> 33:28.350
Yeah.
It's never too early for lunch.

33:32.879 --> 33:35.848
Yeah, I've seen him.
But he's older now.

33:35.882 --> 33:38.617
His hair is gray.
It's in one of them damn ponytails.

33:38.652 --> 33:40.753
Looks ridiculous on an old guy like him.

33:40.787 --> 33:42.021
I know what you mean.

33:42.055 --> 33:44.990
- You won't catch me growing mine out.
- Hm. Is he a regular?

33:45.025 --> 33:46.826
No. He comes in from time to time.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.695
- When's the last time you saw him?
- I don't know. Couple days ago.

33:49.730 --> 33:53.032
- Was he with this man?
- Yeah. They went out of here laughing.

33:53.066 --> 33:54.900
Can you remember
anything else about him?

33:54.968 --> 33:56.869
Like, does he ever talk
about where he lives?

33:56.903 --> 33:58.871
- No.
- What about a car?

33:58.905 --> 34:02.374
I saw him getting into an old,
green pickup across the street.

34:03.310 --> 34:05.111
Now, unless you're
ordering the daily special,

34:05.145 --> 34:07.920
I got to get back to
my paying customers.

34:10.283 --> 34:13.351
The victim 18 months ago
owned a 2004 green Ford pickup

34:13.387 --> 34:14.987
that's been missing since the murder.

34:15.021 --> 34:16.621
Let's put a BOLO out on that

34:16.656 --> 34:19.576
and let them know the
driver's armed and dangerous.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.068
- Anything on the BOLO?
- Nothing.

34:26.136 --> 34:27.469
All right, well, I set up
surveillance on the diner

34:27.504 --> 34:29.438
and every large park in the city.

34:33.342 --> 34:35.110
There's something
else I got to tell you.

34:36.413 --> 34:40.416
Uh...
I'm, um...

34:43.253 --> 34:45.054
I-I'm... I'm pregnant.

34:49.525 --> 34:53.228
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

34:53.263 --> 34:55.364
Only Maura and my family know, so...

34:55.399 --> 35:00.136
- Well, thank you for including me.
- Well, you're family, Vince.

35:00.170 --> 35:01.904
And... and I want to keep it a secret

35:01.972 --> 35:04.540
<i>until I... can't keep it a secret.</i>

35:04.574 --> 35:08.377
- I mean, Brass finds out, I'll be riding...
- We got a hit on our BOLO.

35:08.412 --> 35:10.780
A patrol officer pulled over
a green 2004 Ford pickup.

35:10.814 --> 35:12.081
We got our guy.

35:30.233 --> 35:31.967
Over there.

35:35.505 --> 35:37.572
Which way did he go?

35:38.041 --> 35:39.241
Okay. Get him an ambulance.

35:39.276 --> 35:41.077
- Spread out.
- What happened?

35:41.111 --> 35:44.180
I hit the lights. The guy pulls
over, bolts from the truck.

35:44.214 --> 35:45.848
I chased him before I
realized he had a gun.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.216
You're gonna be okay.

35:47.284 --> 35:50.453
I've got an officer down.
Send me an ambulance ASAP.

36:57.187 --> 36:58.621
He's dead.

36:58.655 --> 37:00.089
Jane?

37:06.329 --> 37:09.999
Jane!
Jane! Jane!!

37:10.033 --> 37:12.101
Hey! Hey, look at me.
You okay?

37:12.135 --> 37:14.003
Okay. Come on.

37:14.037 --> 37:16.338
All right. Okay, okay.

37:16.373 --> 37:19.108
Get up.
Come on, come on.

37:19.142 --> 37:20.209
Come on. Come on.

37:20.243 --> 37:21.510
Get up. Come on. Get up.

37:21.545 --> 37:22.611
All right, all right.

37:22.646 --> 37:24.547
You're okay. Breathe.

37:24.581 --> 37:25.514
Breathe for me.

37:25.549 --> 37:28.284
That's it. Okay.

37:28.318 --> 37:30.419
- You okay, you okay?
- Thank you.

37:30.453 --> 37:31.921
Come here, come here.

37:31.955 --> 37:33.522
All right.

37:38.695 --> 37:41.463
I mean, none of this stuff
is worth killing over.

37:41.531 --> 37:44.166
Losing the family farm
clearly screwed him up.

37:44.201 --> 37:47.036
Maybe he felt he was owed
something because of it.

37:47.070 --> 37:51.640
- Yeah, or he was just an asshole.
- Certainly more concise.

37:57.547 --> 38:01.517
I figured something bad happened.
I just kept hoping that one day,

38:01.551 --> 38:04.053
he'd walk through my door
and everything would be okay.

38:04.087 --> 38:08.090
It was because of your friendship
we were able to find his murderer.

38:08.124 --> 38:10.259
Danielson would have killed
again. You saved lives.

38:10.293 --> 38:13.028
I just wish I could have saved Brooks.

38:16.266 --> 38:18.667
I told him he didn't
have to take that job.

38:18.702 --> 38:21.303
I don't know why he
wouldn't let me help him.

38:21.371 --> 38:24.473
Everybody needs help sometimes.

38:33.450 --> 38:36.118
How are you doing with the shooting?

38:36.186 --> 38:39.688
I'm okay.
I mean, he made his decision.

38:39.723 --> 38:42.224
I had no choice. I just reacted.

38:42.259 --> 38:48.297
- That's a very healthy attitude.
- I'm all about the healthy choices.

38:48.331 --> 38:51.200
So, is that why you
decided to join me tonight?

38:51.234 --> 38:53.435
Well, you said it'd be good for me.

38:53.470 --> 38:55.344
As simple as that?

38:56.673 --> 38:59.341
All right, well, you are
going to love it here.

38:59.409 --> 39:02.511
It's very peaceful, and
the staff is very friendly.

39:02.545 --> 39:05.114
Remind me again why it's so good for me.

39:05.148 --> 39:07.633
Well, as your pregnancy advances
and you gain more and more

39:07.634 --> 39:10.119
weight, there's an increased
strain on your legs and your feet.

39:10.186 --> 39:13.155
- Sounds lovely.
- You'll be fine.

39:13.189 --> 39:15.291
This class is all about
building up the muscles

39:15.325 --> 39:17.593
that you'll need to
handle your new body.

39:19.596 --> 39:21.096
Mm.

39:21.164 --> 39:22.824
Jane, those are someone else's shoes.

39:26.269 --> 39:29.071
My feet are clean.

39:30.407 --> 39:33.275
Ooh.
They do look fabulous on you.

39:33.310 --> 39:34.343
Ohhh!

39:36.079 --> 39:38.280
What?!

39:38.348 --> 39:40.582
Mm...

39:40.617 --> 39:42.251
Mm-mm.

39:42.285 --> 39:46.585
Not bad for a pregnant lady, hmm?

39:47.390 --> 39:50.159
Jane, why are you really here?

39:51.895 --> 39:56.230
Because I realized I have to
let you help me with this baby.

39:56.265 --> 40:00.001
Wow.
It's not easy for you to ask for help.

40:01.404 --> 40:03.205
I can't do this alone, Maura.

40:03.239 --> 40:06.375
Nobody can. It takes a village.

40:06.409 --> 40:10.779
And your family and me... we
are happy to be your village.

40:14.451 --> 40:19.355
- Are those yours?
- Uh... no.

40:19.389 --> 40:21.685
Then what do you think you're doing?

40:22.492 --> 40:24.493
Admiring them?

40:24.527 --> 40:26.829
Yeah, this isn't a shoe store.
They don't belong to you.

40:26.863 --> 40:30.249
- She was just...
- Trying on other people's shoes.

40:31.167 --> 40:33.167
Who does that?

40:34.537 --> 40:38.140
- I'll just take them off.
- Yes, you will.

40:38.174 --> 40:40.574
And you'll wait right here while
I go speak to an instructor.

40:44.214 --> 40:47.432
Oh, you're right.
The staff is "so friendly."

40:47.467 --> 40:50.185
I am suddenly not feeling
like taking a class tonight.

40:50.220 --> 40:51.320
Oh, good.

40:51.354 --> 40:53.188
Well, why don't I take my
village out for a burger?

40:53.223 --> 40:54.923
Oh. You know what?

40:54.958 --> 40:57.559
This villager thinks
that's an excellent idea.

40:57.594 --> 40:59.628
Just hurry.

40:59.696 --> 41:02.131
You know, burgers can be a little fatty.

41:02.165 --> 41:04.433
Okay, fine.
I'll have the turkey burger.

41:04.467 --> 41:07.202
You know, a quinoa burger
actually isn't a bad choice.

41:07.237 --> 41:08.837
Don't push it, Maura.

41:08.872 --> 41:13.388
<i>Maybe you should have a...
Toe burger with your new shoes.</i>

41:13.423 --> 41:15.444
<i>I can't believe I did that.</i>

41:15.478 --> 41:18.580
<i>W-why didn't you stand up
and stop me or something?</i>

41:18.615 --> 41:21.316
<i>- She scared me.
- Okay, ready?</i>

41:21.351 --> 41:23.132
<i>1, 2, 3. Kick!</i>
