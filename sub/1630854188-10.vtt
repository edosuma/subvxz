WEBVTT

00:05.939 --> 00:07.041
<i>We're hosting Christmas
at our house.</i>

00:07.141 --> 00:08.142
This is the dream.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.510
Yeah, well, it's just my sister

00:09.610 --> 00:11.545
and probably a bag
of her laundry, but sure.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.281
Thor hate Christmas.

00:13.381 --> 00:16.617
Are you gonna bring Nigel by
for a special holiday treat?

00:16.717 --> 00:18.619
Well, we're not really ones
for public displays.

00:18.719 --> 00:19.953
So y'all haven't
kissed yet?

00:20.054 --> 00:22.590
I don't owe any of you
an explanation.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.692
<i>I think our relationship</i>

00:24.792 --> 00:26.194
should end.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.896
Oh, I hope it's okay I brought
someone. This is Eric.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.030
Who's this schmuck?

00:30.131 --> 00:31.465
Would you let Trevor
possess your body

00:31.565 --> 00:33.134
so that we can be together?
I'm in.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.636
When Eric gets electrocuted
he'll fly back into your body.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.805
Bela's trying to get
Eric possessed by Trevor.

00:37.905 --> 00:38.906
I'm going to bed.

00:39.006 --> 00:39.940
Merry Christmas.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.909
<i>I should screw that back on.</i>

00:42.009 --> 00:44.011
Aah!

00:56.190 --> 00:57.325
Mmm.

00:57.425 --> 01:00.361
Sam? Did you just
take a large bite

01:00.461 --> 01:02.096
out of a stick of butter?

01:02.196 --> 01:04.665
No. Normal bite.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.066
Okay.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.802
Oh, my God.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.271
Sass, you won't believe
what just happened.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.905
I was fixing a light
and I got shocked

01:12.005 --> 01:13.741
and then I think Thor
possessed me.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.976
Yeah, I was starting
to put those pieces together.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.745
Okay, I just
have to do what Jay did

01:17.845 --> 01:19.713
when Hetty possessed him.
I've got to get into the car,

01:19.813 --> 01:21.149
then drive through
the ghost boundary,

01:21.249 --> 01:23.317
and then Thor will just
pop out of my body.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.119
Okay, where are my keys?

01:25.219 --> 01:26.487
Just throwing this out there.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.622
What if you didn't
eject Thor right away?

01:28.722 --> 01:30.724
You know, what if you
let the big guy hang out?

01:30.824 --> 01:32.059
You know, let him
live it up a little?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.362
No. I'm taking care
of this right now.

01:34.462 --> 01:35.663
Oh, come on.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.399
He's been a ghost
for a thousand years.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.434
Just give him a few hours.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.636
You're always talking
about the Christmas spirit.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.872
This is literally a spirit
you can help on Christmas.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.240
No, I'm sorry.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.376
At least let him
have some cod.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.945
Cod? Where cod?

01:52.045 --> 01:53.281
Thor, is that you?

01:53.381 --> 01:55.216
Yes. Help me, Sass.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.917
Sam no want to let me live.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.619
Okay, we need
to consult an expert.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.888
Someone who knows
about possession.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.690
You have come
to the right place.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.825
By the end
of my time inside Jay,

02:04.925 --> 02:06.894
I had learned
to fully suppress the host.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.463
Lessons I will
impart unto you...

02:09.563 --> 02:11.098
for a price.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.566
What she mean?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.668
I think she wants something
in return for helping us.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.771
Yesterday, Jay showed me a video
that rocked me to my core.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.640
When I asked Samantha to replay

02:19.740 --> 02:22.042
the short lumberjack film
for me, she refused,

02:22.142 --> 02:24.345
saying that she needed
her phone for personal affairs.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.314
So you want Thor
to use Sam's hands

02:26.414 --> 02:27.615
to play the video for you?

02:27.715 --> 02:29.417
Of the muscled man
and his wood, yes.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.586
This is ridiculous.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.488
You are all gonna be
in so much trouble.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.357
Thor, run toward the light.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.359
Run toward the light
and close the door behind you.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.661
Hetty, are you helping him?
Why are you doing this?

02:40.761 --> 02:42.230
You had your chance
to do the right thing.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.464
Now, Thor, the light.
Run!

02:44.998 --> 02:46.800
It working. Thor back.
Yes!

02:46.900 --> 02:48.669
Good!
Now, her phone is downstairs

02:48.769 --> 02:49.870
charging in the kitchen.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.104
Thor on it.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.708
Ah, right.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.578
Meant to warn you
about the solid wood doors.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.788
That was a lovely dinner.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.557
It was a pity the Bradfords
couldn't make it.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.991
They were busy, my dearest?

03:11.091 --> 03:13.261
Oh, no. Last week they
all died of smallpox.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.128
Oh, that's a relief.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.197
I thought they were avoiding us.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.600
You know, next week's
our anniversary.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.834
And I must say it has been

03:20.934 --> 03:23.371
another blissful year. Indeed.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.038
One delight after another.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.307
Although,

03:26.407 --> 03:28.409
if I were to lodge
one small complaint,

03:28.509 --> 03:30.744
it's that you're a big gay liar.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.813
Excuse me?

03:32.913 --> 03:34.315
Your mother's also a tad nosy,

03:34.415 --> 03:36.417
but, yes, I'd say, overall,
the worst part about

03:36.517 --> 03:37.818
our marriage
is that it's a total sham

03:37.918 --> 03:40.053
because, again,
you're a big gay liar.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.221
Wh... Uh...

03:41.322 --> 03:42.256
Greetings!
Oh.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.725
Greetings and salutations.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.628
Ben Franklin,
what are you doing here?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.162
Well, I happened
to be passing by,

03:49.263 --> 03:51.799
and I couldn't help but overhear
the words "big gay liar,"

03:51.899 --> 03:54.167
so I automatically assumed

03:54.268 --> 03:56.437
that someone was discussing
my old pal Higgintoot.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.440
You know too?
I mean, no, I-I'm not.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.941
Well, I, uh,

04:01.041 --> 04:04.111
not discovering any
electricity between you two.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.951
It was only a dream.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.121
<i>How you feeling, Trev?</i>

04:14.221 --> 04:15.989
Sorry you didn't
get to possess Eric.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.458
Oh, it would've been
the second greatest thing

04:17.558 --> 04:18.859
a Jew ever did on Hanukkah.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.595
It would have been the Maccabees
and then T-Money.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.165
Where the hell
is all the butter?

04:26.199 --> 04:27.200
Well, Eric left.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.736
I woke up to a note saying

04:28.836 --> 04:30.704
he was taking the afternoon
train back to Boston.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.640
And he apologized
for ruining Christmas.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.708
I'm sorry, Bela.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.209
The guy just left
his car for her?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.745
I appreciate what this guy
was gonna do for me,

04:37.845 --> 04:39.747
but he is a total tool.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.682
Look, I know from where you're
standing this all seems nuts.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.050
I get it, I'm not an idiot.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.553
But Trevor and I
had a real connection.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.855
It's true. We both love
Hamptons share houses

04:47.955 --> 04:49.289
and partying at Surf Lodge.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.824
Okay, it's not exactly
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

04:50.924 --> 04:52.225
but it's a start.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.327
You're lucky, Jay.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.695
You found the love of your life

04:54.795 --> 04:55.963
and you get to spend
every day with her.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.332
I don't have that.
And now, thanks to you,

04:58.432 --> 04:59.633
I don't even get to be

04:59.733 --> 05:01.268
with the one guy I like
for one day.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.903
Hello.

05:03.003 --> 05:03.904
Is Sam.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.406
What?

05:05.506 --> 05:06.640
Just ask what's happening.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.576
What happen?

05:08.676 --> 05:10.143
Can't literally
just repeat what I said?

05:10.243 --> 05:11.745
Jay will fill you in.
I'm going upstairs.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.080
Merry Christmas.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.515
You okay, babe?

05:14.615 --> 05:15.583
You sound a little funny.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.250
Have cold.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.387
Aw, man, on Christmas?
That's a bummer.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.988
Uh, what's going on?

05:21.088 --> 05:22.790
Thor accidentally possessed Sam

05:22.890 --> 05:24.725
and Hetty taught him
how to stay in there.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.259
Seriously? That is so unfair.

05:26.360 --> 05:29.763
Eric is at the train
station. He's leaving.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.064
Let me ask you something.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.266
Do you think
I was too hard on Bela?

05:33.367 --> 05:35.903
Yes. Yes, tell him yes.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.304
Keep it brief, okay?
If he figures out you're Thor,

05:37.405 --> 05:38.706
he'll drive you
across the ghost boundary

05:38.806 --> 05:40.340
and you'll be out of Sam's body.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.009
Well, Sam?
Yah.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.212
"Yes." The word is "yes," Thor.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.947
I was too harsh?
Yes.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.282
I did it.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.851
Is that a ghost thing?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.953
Yes.
So what should I do?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.856
Tell him to go to the train
station and get Eric back here.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.925
That's too many words, man.
He'll figure it out.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.026
Get Eric.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.227
Like, from
the train station?

06:00.327 --> 06:01.962
That could...
That's kind of fun.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.564
It's like at the end
of <i>Single and Ready to Kringle,</i>

06:03.664 --> 06:06.534
when Derek chased down Holly
at the North Pole airport.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.136
Yes. And bring back cod.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.905
Okay, my girl
wants Christmas dinner.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.040
We'll make it happen.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.576
Oh, move over, Judah Maccabee.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.645
There's a new
Hanukkah hero in town.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.080
Stupid little man. No idea.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.255
Evil tree, decorated
to mock my people.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.659
Whoa.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.327
Ghost power still
work inside Sam.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.029
Pretty cool.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.398
I guess the rumors are true.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.133
This a wacky turn of events.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.570
Yes. Watch this.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.106
Thor can eat now.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.975
Oh, boy, I'm happy
for you, buddy.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.209
How is that Christmas cookie?

06:49.309 --> 06:51.712
This Christmas cookie?

06:51.812 --> 06:53.647
But is amazing.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.948
That's the thing
about Christmas.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.316
It's got the best foods.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.787
And not just desserts.
Honey baked hams, turkeys.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.523
Trevor was telling me his family
used to do Chinese food.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.659
What your family eat?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.327
Well, we're Italian,
so we did something called

07:07.427 --> 07:08.962
the Feast of Seven Fishes.

07:09.062 --> 07:09.963
Shut up!

07:10.063 --> 07:11.031
No, I'm serious.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.966
It was like, uh, fried cod,

07:13.066 --> 07:14.167
baked halibut.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.936
Ooh, have you heard of calamari?

07:16.036 --> 07:17.571
I've heard tales.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.206
Okay,

07:19.306 --> 07:21.408
so Christmas food pretty good.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.977
Is this what you like about it?
I mean,

07:24.077 --> 07:25.813
partly, but honestly,

07:25.913 --> 07:28.215
the best thing about
Christmas is family,

07:28.315 --> 07:29.817
being with the people you love.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.554
Thor do like family.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.757
Thor miss celebrate holidays
with family.

07:36.857 --> 07:40.227
Well, in a way, I mean,
the ghosts, Sam and Jay,

07:40.327 --> 07:41.562
we're all sort of like
your family.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.797
So if you did
feel like celebrating,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.766
you could celebrate
with all of us.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.235
That would be...

07:48.335 --> 07:51.371
very nice, but...

07:51.471 --> 07:53.674
of course,
Thor no into Christmas.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.175
Right, sure.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.744
That's too bad.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.246
Damn.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.014
This cookie good.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.885
Eric? Eric! Hey!

08:04.985 --> 08:06.253
Oh!

08:06.353 --> 08:07.454
Thank God I caught you.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.856
Jay, what-what
are you doing here?

08:08.956 --> 08:10.157
I'm here to ask you

08:10.257 --> 08:11.892
to come back to
the mansion with me.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.161
Ah, fancy pants over here's
got a mansion,

08:14.261 --> 08:15.328
wants everyone to know.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.930
My wife inherited it.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.799
Wait. I don't need to get
into the whole story.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.100
Jay, I'm really sorry,

08:20.200 --> 08:21.268
it's just, things got too weird.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.736
I think it's best if I just go.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.004
No.
Yeah.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.139
Look, can-can we talk
somewhere privately?

08:26.239 --> 08:27.407
Uh, I-I would, it's just,

08:27.507 --> 08:28.876
I don't want to
lose my place in line.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.510
If I end up with one of
the backward-facing chairs,

08:30.611 --> 08:31.812
I'm gonna get trainsick.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.246
Fine.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.616
I realized I was
too judgmental

08:35.716 --> 08:37.217
about that thing
that you wanted to do

08:37.317 --> 08:38.552
with my sister last night.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.788
Whoa!
Come on, man! Grow up!

08:40.888 --> 08:43.557
Look, I just want
Bela to be happy.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.458
Yeah, that's all I want too.
Okay, great,

08:45.559 --> 08:46.960
so will you
come back with me?

08:47.060 --> 08:48.862
Oh, uh...

08:48.962 --> 08:49.997
Is it gonna hurt?

08:50.097 --> 08:53.300
Honestly, yeah, man,
a little bit.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.402
But once they're
fully inside,

08:55.502 --> 08:57.204
it's not that bad.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.907
Come on, man,
it's frickin' Christmas.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.842
This guy.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.678
<i>I just don't know how Thor's
pulled this off for so long.</i>

09:04.778 --> 09:06.546
I mean, at some point,
Jay's gonna notice

09:06.647 --> 09:08.616
Sam's not using a lot of verbs. Seriously.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.384
I saw Sam carrying a
rotisserie chicken like a baby.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.120
That's got to raise
some red flags.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.424
Everything okay, Isaac?
Well, no.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.127
I had the most
troubling nightmare.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.494
Ooh, tell me.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.330
I'm really good
at interpreting dreams.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.265
It was kind of
my thing in the cult.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.635
That and tracking down runners.

09:27.735 --> 09:31.204
Well, in the dream,
my dear Beatrice

09:31.304 --> 09:32.973
accused me of being

09:33.073 --> 09:34.775
a "big gay liar,"

09:34.875 --> 09:37.144
and saying that
I wasted her life.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.012
Hmm, this is a tough one.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.881
Did you have all your teeth?

09:40.981 --> 09:42.683
It-it wasn't your fault,
though. I mean,

09:42.783 --> 09:44.618
you were still
figuring things out yourself.

09:44.718 --> 09:48.021
Yes, but I still trapped her
in a sham marriage.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.090
Maybe that's why you haven't
been able to kiss Nigel.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.692
Because you feel guilty.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.329
You're right.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.631
Why should I be happy

09:57.731 --> 09:59.432
when she never
got to be happy?

09:59.532 --> 10:01.902
This is great news. Now
you know what the problem is. Yeah.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.704
The problem is
that I wronged somebody

10:03.804 --> 10:05.505
who died 200 years ago

10:05.605 --> 10:06.940
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.542
That's very useful information.
Thank you, Pete.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.378
You are my little
chicken baby.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.646
Yes, you are.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.247
But I will eat you!

10:14.347 --> 10:16.116
Okay, it's kind of weird, but...

10:16.216 --> 10:19.519
I like seeing this
maternal side of Sam.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.222
Now watch me handle my wood.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.057
Split it.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.759
Split that log.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.929
Yes, a decisive blow.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.130
Again.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.466
Alexa, add mead
to shopping list.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.036
I have put mead
on your shopping list.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.437
Yes!
Okay, uh,

10:37.537 --> 10:38.806
now do, uh, frozen pizzas.

10:38.906 --> 10:42.609
Alexa, now add
frozen pizzas.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.212
I put frozen pizzas
on your shopping list.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.279
Yes!

10:46.379 --> 10:48.448
Hey, have you seen Jay?

10:48.548 --> 10:50.183
Yes. Many times.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.584
Good one.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.153
You should really
take some DayQuil for that.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.024
Oh! Did you get the ghosts
Christmas presents?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.293
Huh. So sweet.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.795
Well, it's Christmas day.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.497
Should we open any for them?
Are any of them in here?

11:05.432 --> 11:06.867
Thor.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.436
You want to do the honors?

11:09.536 --> 11:11.371
What is it?

11:11.471 --> 11:12.873
Sam would know
what it is.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.507
Jay get.

11:14.607 --> 11:15.876
Good save.

11:17.644 --> 11:21.014
Is nice, feeling of
anticipation and mystery.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.017
Did you get into the eggnog?
You sound a little loopy.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.465
This for me.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.400
Is what Thor said.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.835
Does he like it?

11:42.803 --> 11:45.605
Thor... love... it.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.307
Merry Christmas,
big guy,

11:47.407 --> 11:48.742
wherever in the room you are.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.111
He says thank you.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.646
Look who I found.

11:53.747 --> 11:54.647
Merry Christmas.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.416
What the hell, Jay?

11:56.516 --> 11:58.018
Did you get Eric
from the train station?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.453
I don't know if you
and Trevor have a future

12:00.553 --> 12:02.455
or what you see in him.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.457
I don't know why Eric
is signing up for this,

12:04.557 --> 12:07.694
but you're my sister
and it's Christmas.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.496
So let's get a ghost
in this dude, huh?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.499
Yes!

12:12.599 --> 12:14.334
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

12:14.434 --> 12:16.336
It's what you want, and that's
what's important to me.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.071
This guy is a mensch.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.807
I'm gonna do some pushups
when I get in there.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.175
I'll leave your body
better than I found it.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.811
Okay, are we ready?

12:23.911 --> 12:26.279
Hetty, they're gonna zap him!
You want to come watch?

12:26.379 --> 12:27.447
I'm good!

12:27.547 --> 12:29.516
Really?
It's a possession!

12:29.616 --> 12:32.085
I'll catch the next one!

12:32.185 --> 12:33.753
Okay, proceed.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.597
Oh, my God. Eric,

12:44.697 --> 12:47.034
are you okay?
Trevor, are you in there?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.335
Uh, nope.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.337
Oh, my God.
He doesn't have a pulse.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.205
That not good.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.542
My God.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.212
Did it work?

12:59.312 --> 13:00.547
Uh, no, dude.
You're dead.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.149
Oh, no.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.416
Hi, I'm Flower.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.684
I wandered over to the property

13:04.784 --> 13:06.820
from a music festival
in the 60s,

13:06.920 --> 13:08.822
and then
I tried to befriend a bear.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.024
Drugs were involved.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.994
And he's staying.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.036
Eric! Come back! Eric!
Okay, I got the defibrillator!

13:23.136 --> 13:25.038
Everybody stand back!

13:25.138 --> 13:26.974
I just have to check
a quick YouTube video.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.475
Hurry, Jay!

13:28.575 --> 13:30.243
Why would you put an ad
in front of something like this?

13:30.343 --> 13:31.979
So, uh, you
must be Trevor?

13:32.079 --> 13:33.680
Yeah, bro.
Thanks for the effort.

13:33.780 --> 13:34.848
Oh, yeah.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.150
He's gonna regret
that reindeer sweater.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.552
Thor, take the body,
weigh it down,

13:39.652 --> 13:41.688
throw it in
the lake with Trevor.

13:41.788 --> 13:42.890
I'm so sorry, Eric.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.224
I should have
given you a chance.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.093
I'll regret it for
the rest of my life.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.561
That is unfortunate timing.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.797
If I yell "clear,"
will it know what to do?

13:50.898 --> 13:53.600
Move aside, small man!

14:02.842 --> 14:04.111
Oh, thank God.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.013
I'm so sorry, Eric.
Are you okay?

14:06.113 --> 14:07.614
I don't want to do that again.

14:07.714 --> 14:08.781
You don't have to.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.550
Come on, let's
get you upstairs.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.853
I think I saw Trevor.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.388
Impressive jawline.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.257
He's a really great guy.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.226
Whoa, whoa.
What the hell was that?

14:19.326 --> 14:22.329
Uh, what you mean?

14:23.130 --> 14:24.831
I think it's time
to give it up, big guy.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.867
Okay, I am Thor.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.172
But you weren't Thor
last night, were you?

14:35.675 --> 14:38.345
No, it-it was me.
But... really?

14:38.445 --> 14:40.413
A whole day, Jay?
You didn't notice?

14:40.513 --> 14:41.748
Well, I mean,
I had a lot going on.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.251
Bela, Christmas.
I went to a train station.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.652
Get the car keys, Jay.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.854
We're driving through
the ghost boundary.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.791
Aah!

14:51.891 --> 14:54.227
Was fun,

14:54.327 --> 14:56.696
but I missed wolf urine.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.732
Mmm.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.901
Is good to be back.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.371
<i>So, how's he doing?</i>

15:04.471 --> 15:07.440
I think he's gonna be okay.
That was so scary.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.876
Yeah, it was a pretty
crazy thing Eric did, huh?

15:09.977 --> 15:13.513
Definitely not the actions
of a safe, predictable guy.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.649
So you're saying Eric
is kind of... dangerous?

15:16.749 --> 15:17.917
I'm saying Eric

15:18.018 --> 15:19.886
is deeply unstable.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.158
Huh.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.628
Well, I successfully
removed myself

15:28.728 --> 15:31.298
from the unrelenting grip
of the TikToks.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.101
It mustered all my
self-control, but I did it.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.435
Sam took her phone back,
didn't she?

15:35.535 --> 15:37.170
Very first minute
she could.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.905
What is that
on your handkerchief?

15:39.006 --> 15:40.540
Hmm? Oh, it's a cricket.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.309
Beatrice embroidered
it on there.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.177
That was her
nickname for me.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.678
She said I had a tendency

15:45.778 --> 15:48.215
to chirp endlessly
like a cricket.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.983
Huh. Cricket.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.384
I remember during the war

15:51.484 --> 15:53.120
when you were here,
dying on the property,

15:53.220 --> 15:54.587
there was a woman
who came to visit,

15:54.687 --> 15:56.456
and she called you cricket.

15:57.357 --> 16:01.261
Are you saying Beatrice came
to visit me on my deathbed?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.097
<i>I was in the medical
tent, seeing if anyone cool</i>

16:04.197 --> 16:06.799
<i>was gonna become a ghost,
when I saw something strange.</i>

16:06.899 --> 16:10.637
I must see Captain Higgintoot.
I've come a long way.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.272
<i>A woman, who I assume
was a nurse,</i>

16:12.372 --> 16:14.541
<i>was adamant about
changing you into your uniform</i>

16:14.641 --> 16:16.409
<i>before you passed.</i>

16:16.509 --> 16:18.378
I'm here now, Cricket.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.348
Let's get you
out of these filthy rags.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.318
Beatrice came all that way

16:25.418 --> 16:27.387
just to change my clothes

16:27.487 --> 16:29.422
and be with me
in my final moments?

16:32.125 --> 16:34.561
Seems like your wife
really cared about you, Isaac.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.863
Doesn't sound like someone
who thought you ruined her life.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.399
But she knew.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.568
She-she had to have known.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.037
And yet she came.
What does that tell you?

16:45.372 --> 16:48.375
That she... forgave me.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.876
And if she forgave you then,

16:49.976 --> 16:51.711
don't you think
she'd want you to be happy now?

16:53.213 --> 16:55.382
Oh...

16:55.482 --> 16:57.150
Oh, thank you, guys.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.086
You got it, Cricket.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.887
Oh. God, it's so funny.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.523
I thought my men were the ones
who changed my clothes.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.858
They checked in on me
frequently, I assume.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.928
Oh, yeah, yeah.
A lot-lot of checking in.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.797
This is such a relief.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.266
Oh, I feel such a flutter.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.069
No, that is the dysentery.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.039
<i>Morning, Sam.</i>

17:20.140 --> 17:22.075
It is Sam, right?

17:22.175 --> 17:23.643
How do you feel
about Danes?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.912
Honestly, I don't know
anything about them.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.314
That's my girl.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.415
How you doing?

17:28.515 --> 17:30.783
Glad to be alone in my body,

17:30.883 --> 17:32.785
but sad
to have missed Christmas,

17:32.885 --> 17:35.188
and not loving the fish burps.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.757
Yeah, you ate a lot of haddock.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.660
In retrospect,
the signs were there.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.495
Oh, my God,

17:42.595 --> 17:44.297
it's snowing.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.598
Aw, one day
too late, huh?

17:45.698 --> 17:49.369
♪ I'm dreaming of a white... ♪

17:49.469 --> 17:51.371
What's that?

17:51.471 --> 17:52.372
Coffee?

17:52.472 --> 17:53.573
No, the singing.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.208
Oh, I don't hear
any singing,

18:18.431 --> 18:19.566

18:19.666 --> 18:21.401

Because Christmas

18:21.501 --> 18:23.603
isn't just day on calendar.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.772
It is time with people you love.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.642
Hey, babe, somebody ripped
the head off a Santa.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.646
That was before I
learn lesson.

Great job, babe.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.793
Well, it wasn't exactly

19:20.893 --> 19:23.062
the wholesome
Christmas movie I wanted,

19:23.162 --> 19:24.531
but we got there.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.599
I just hope
he doesn't sue us.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.034
We should probably
get him to sign a waiver

19:28.134 --> 19:30.803
or something
before he goes home.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.673
Samantha, Thor
have great idea.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.808
What if we make
me possessing you

19:35.908 --> 19:37.610
Christmas tradition?

19:37.710 --> 19:39.812
I'm gonna say
hard no to that.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.482
Don't answer now.
Think about it.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.151
Merry Christmas, everyone.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.620
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.589
And happy Hanukkah.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.324
Happy Hanukkah, right.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.136
That was some day, huh?

20:04.237 --> 20:06.005
Aye, indeed it was.

20:06.105 --> 20:08.007
I was so close.

I... I'm happy for Bela.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.678
I just...

20:11.778 --> 20:13.480
I'm just a little...

20:13.580 --> 20:15.415
revved up,
if you know what I mean.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.585
Sorry, I shouldn't
say that in front of you.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.754
No, no, I know
exactly what you mean.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.557
To lust for one just
out of reach, it's torture.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.259
Tell me about it.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.696
Leaves you
feeling... hungry.

20:29.796 --> 20:30.897
Starving.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.064
Ravenous.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.766
Horned up.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.001
How dare you?

20:35.101 --> 20:36.469
Did I go too far?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.605
Not nearly far enough,
you pantless son of a bitch.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.206
