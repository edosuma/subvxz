WEBVTT

00:01.242 --> 00:03.620
(static buzzing)

00:03.620 --> 00:07.440
- Beyond the trauma of human failure

00:07.440 --> 00:10.803
lies the stillness of cosmic wisdom.

00:10.803 --> 00:11.636
(static buzzing)

00:11.636 --> 00:15.853
When people with poor wisdom
tread among sleeping tigers

00:15.853 --> 00:16.950
(static buzzing)

00:16.950 --> 00:18.873
they shall meet with disaster.

00:20.609 --> 00:21.990
(static buzzing)

00:21.990 --> 00:25.143
I have thrown the three coins six times.

00:26.146 --> 00:29.503
I have read the upper and lower trigrams.

00:29.503 --> 00:31.430
(static buzzing)

00:31.430 --> 00:34.569
This reading is for
those who come after us.

00:34.569 --> 00:35.914
(mysterious whirring)

00:35.914 --> 00:37.164
Who survive us!

00:38.796 --> 00:41.546
(static buzzing)

00:42.683 --> 00:45.433
(static buzzing)

00:46.485 --> 00:48.112
(mysterious whirring)

00:48.112 --> 00:51.295
(static buzzing)

00:51.295 --> 00:56.295
(static buzzing)
(static whooshing)

00:57.254 --> 01:00.103
(static buzzing)

01:00.103 --> 01:03.020
(foreboding music)

01:18.783 --> 01:21.950
(wind howling softly)

01:24.199 --> 01:27.116
(foreboding music)

01:45.966 --> 01:48.966
(adventurous music)

02:28.044 --> 02:30.877
(thrilling music)

02:56.357 --> 02:59.183
(mysterious music)

02:59.183 --> 03:01.240
- [Link] Acting Captain Babylon.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.520
- [Babylon] Yes.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.760
- [Raven] You have to be ready.

03:04.760 --> 03:06.250
- [Babylon] Raven?

03:06.250 --> 03:08.583
- [Oracle] A one-eyed man is able to see.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.213
A lame man is able to tread.

03:13.340 --> 03:15.483
But he treads on the tail of the tiger.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.363
The tiger bites the man.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.791
And thus is the reading
of The Book of Changes.

03:22.791 --> 03:26.374
(ominous electronic music)

03:30.727 --> 03:32.375
(electricity whirring)

03:32.375 --> 03:35.208
(Babylon gasping)

03:37.540 --> 03:39.014
- Maybe it's time to clock out.

03:39.014 --> 03:41.290
- (sighs) We're too close
to the planet, Kondor.

03:41.290 --> 03:42.553
Need to stay frosty.

03:43.495 --> 03:46.328
(buttons beeping)

03:49.152 --> 03:50.423
- Aye, aye.

03:50.423 --> 03:53.300
End of the rainbow dead ahead, Captain.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.497
- Just fly it in a straight line, okay?

03:55.497 --> 03:58.664
(electronics beeping)

04:00.565 --> 04:03.315
(ship whooshing)

04:04.670 --> 04:06.817
- [Kondor] Can you just think about it?

04:06.817 --> 04:09.667
- (sighs) I guess I'm just an
old-fashioned girl, Kondor.

04:14.103 --> 04:15.506
(sighs) I just think a marriage is

04:15.506 --> 04:18.177
between two men and two women.

04:18.177 --> 04:20.584
- You sound like my grandmas.

04:20.584 --> 04:24.000
- Raven wasn't just a captain,
she was a great first wife.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.220
And I don't think we're
ready for another captain

04:26.220 --> 04:28.110
or a new wife.

04:28.110 --> 04:29.802
Besides, you were brought on as a crewman,

04:29.802 --> 04:32.169
not a third husband.

04:32.169 --> 04:33.780
- Why not both?

04:33.780 --> 04:35.070
- [Link] We are nearing Caliban.

04:35.070 --> 04:37.900
Orbit in retrograde.

04:37.900 --> 04:41.220
Terraforming is a three of five.

04:41.220 --> 04:42.220
- Sounds good, Link.

04:43.090 --> 04:45.513
Oh, what about the robot?

04:46.530 --> 04:48.690
- Does that thing even
have a pleasure circuit?

04:48.690 --> 04:50.840
- Depends on what you call pleasure.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.690
- Crew member, Kondor, is that a question?

04:54.690 --> 04:55.780
- Uh, no.

04:55.780 --> 04:57.484
I'd rather not know.

04:57.484 --> 05:00.067
(keys beeping)

05:02.018 --> 05:04.672
(dramatic whooshing)
(energy blasting)

05:04.672 --> 05:06.385
(mysterious music)

05:06.385 --> 05:08.818
(light blasting)

05:08.818 --> 05:11.485
(alarm blaring)

05:14.687 --> 05:19.687
(Babylon sighing)
(alarm blaring)

05:21.438 --> 05:24.355
(mysterious music)

05:26.269 --> 05:29.673
(static buzzing)

05:29.673 --> 05:34.673
(alarm blaring)
(man groaning)

05:35.460 --> 05:37.176
- Link, do you have a reading on that?

05:37.176 --> 05:42.176
(alarm blaring)
(eerie whirring)

05:45.205 --> 05:46.524
What?

05:46.524 --> 05:49.191
(alarm blaring)

05:50.510 --> 05:52.690
Was that a passing meteor or something?

05:52.690 --> 05:53.940
- Acting Captain Babylon,

05:54.922 --> 05:57.080
it was from the surface of Caliban.

05:59.188 --> 06:02.703
(machine buzzing)

06:02.703 --> 06:05.176
- Somebody messing with us down there?

06:05.176 --> 06:07.310
- Negative, Crew member Kondor.

06:07.310 --> 06:10.907
There are no human lifeforms
registered on Caliban.

06:10.907 --> 06:13.531
It is currently operated
by machine systems.

06:13.531 --> 06:14.860
(machine whirring)

06:14.860 --> 06:16.281
- Registered down there
and being down there

06:16.281 --> 06:17.890
are two different things.

06:17.890 --> 06:21.250
- Is that a question,
Acting Captain Babylon?

06:21.250 --> 06:22.465
- Pirates?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.390
- I don't know if there
are pirates out this far,

06:24.390 --> 06:26.240
but there are 27 moons out here.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.540
Hard to tell what this is.

06:28.690 --> 06:30.719
This is the mining ship
Robert Indiana from the port

06:30.719 --> 06:34.080
of Elysium Mons and flying a Martian flag.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.050
Calling moon Caliban.

06:36.050 --> 06:39.230
Again, this is the Robert
Indiana under Martian flag.

06:39.230 --> 06:41.284
We have a license to repair
and maintain the mining

06:41.284 --> 06:44.343
equipment under authorization
from the Pangaea Supergov.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.360
- [Kidd] Babylon, it's Kidd.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.473
I've got bad news.

06:48.473 --> 06:50.422
- I don't need it, but go ahead.

06:50.422 --> 06:53.400
- We got power dropping in
the engine since that blast.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.500
What did we get hit with?

06:55.500 --> 06:56.333
- Unknown.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.150
All Link could tell us is
what it couldn't have been.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.910
- Yeah, droids are funny that way.

07:00.910 --> 07:02.563
What does your gut tell ya, Babs?

07:03.510 --> 07:05.830
- I don't think it was
passing space debris.

07:05.830 --> 07:07.680
It's from the surface.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.680
- [Kidd] Roger that.

07:11.380 --> 07:12.213
- Did you hit your head?

07:12.213 --> 07:14.843
- [Babylon] I, I don't think so.

07:18.192 --> 07:20.941
(explosion blasting)

07:20.941 --> 07:22.454
(dramatic whirring)

07:22.454 --> 07:23.595
Are you okay?

07:23.595 --> 07:26.320
(objects clattering)

07:26.320 --> 07:27.153
- Do you feel it?

07:27.153 --> 07:29.150
- What?
- Under your ribs.

07:30.142 --> 07:33.112
(machines buzzing)

07:33.112 --> 07:36.945
(mysterious electronic music)

07:39.365 --> 07:41.665
- We're falling, we're
falling toward Caliban!

07:43.620 --> 07:45.450
Kidd, are you there?

07:45.450 --> 07:47.880
- Here, Babs, but the engines are gone.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.670
Get ready to tuck and roll.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.132
- Good advice, Kidd.

07:51.132 --> 07:54.382
(electricity whirring)

07:57.136 --> 08:00.812
(announcer muttering)

08:00.812 --> 08:03.140
- Have you checked on our husband?

08:03.140 --> 08:04.440
- Oh, no.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.040
He was supposed to be
checking on the mining drones.

08:07.970 --> 08:09.590
Chafe, are you there?

08:09.590 --> 08:10.885
Chafe?

08:10.885 --> 08:12.770
- I'm good, Babylon.

08:12.770 --> 08:14.205
Just took a tumble.

08:14.205 --> 08:16.100
- You're about to take another one.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.858
Everyone, hang on.

08:17.858 --> 08:19.557
(mysterious electronic music)

08:19.557 --> 08:22.390
(devices buzzing)

08:24.966 --> 08:28.000
- Collision imminent, collision imminent.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.270
Chance of survival of human crew--

08:30.270 --> 08:31.500
- Shut up, Link!

08:31.500 --> 08:32.333
- Hang on!

08:34.304 --> 08:37.190
(dramatic music)

08:37.190 --> 08:39.516
(ship crashing)

08:39.516 --> 08:44.516
(metal scratching)
(devices buzzing)

08:47.816 --> 08:50.483
(alarm blaring)

08:54.084 --> 08:57.917
(mysterious electronic music)

09:06.073 --> 09:09.406
(mysterious vocalizing)

09:13.036 --> 09:15.507
(dramatic music)

09:15.507 --> 09:17.519
(wind howling)

09:17.519 --> 09:18.860
(static buzzing)

09:18.860 --> 09:20.410
- [Raven] You have to be ready.

09:21.910 --> 09:24.133
You have to be ready.

09:25.824 --> 09:27.180
(electricity blasting)

09:27.180 --> 09:29.703
Listen to him, Babylon.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.493
Come back to us.

09:38.007 --> 09:39.623
(electricity blasting)

09:39.623 --> 09:43.983
- When people with poor wisdom
tread among sleeping tigers,

09:45.300 --> 09:47.143
they shall meet with disaster.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.006
(electricity blasting)

09:49.006 --> 09:52.006
(creature growling)

09:53.464 --> 09:58.384
(electricity blasting)
(mysterious vocalizing)

09:58.384 --> 10:01.134
(static buzzing)

10:06.990 --> 10:07.823
(eerie whirring)

10:07.823 --> 10:11.287
(energy blasting)

10:11.287 --> 10:14.037
(static buzzing)

10:16.024 --> 10:21.024
(energy blasting)
(Babylon groaning)

10:24.422 --> 10:25.255
- Kondor?

10:27.718 --> 10:31.629
(alarm blaring softly)

10:31.629 --> 10:32.654
(keys beeping)

10:32.654 --> 10:33.487
Kidd?

10:34.470 --> 10:35.693
Kidd, are you there?

10:38.434 --> 10:41.783
(keys beeping)
Chafe, is anyone there?

10:42.991 --> 10:43.824
Link!

10:45.130 --> 10:45.963
- Babs.

10:47.177 --> 10:50.073
We're all going to die, Babs.

10:53.269 --> 10:56.069
(eerie whooshing)

10:56.069 --> 10:57.018
(energy blasting)

10:57.018 --> 10:57.851
(Babylon screams)

10:57.851 --> 10:59.200
- Hey, hey, whoa, you're all right.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.610
You're all right.

11:00.610 --> 11:01.443
Everyone's all right.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.180
- I thought I saw.

11:03.180 --> 11:05.380
- We crash landed, but
everyone's all right.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.633
Are you all right?

11:08.670 --> 11:09.816
- Nevermind that.

11:09.816 --> 11:11.970
Link, status update?

11:11.970 --> 11:14.693
- Caliban had its origins
in the Edgeworth Belt.

11:14.693 --> 11:19.170
Moved by a gas strike in
the proto-planetary depths.

11:19.170 --> 11:23.230
And before terraforming was
composed of methane, ammonium--

11:23.230 --> 11:25.540
- Something freaking useful, Link!

11:25.540 --> 11:29.320
- Acting Captain Babylon,
we have crash landed.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.663
- Ain't robots great?

11:31.640 --> 11:36.480
- There is a nearby
station designated A-119.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.759
It could be the location of the attack

11:38.759 --> 11:42.075
or it could be a source for assistance.

11:42.075 --> 11:44.658
(wind howling)

11:47.296 --> 11:50.046
(metal clanging)

11:50.980 --> 11:54.610
- I thought this planet had
only been populated by machines?

11:54.610 --> 11:57.373
- [Link] Crew member
Kondor, is that a question?

11:57.373 --> 12:00.206
(devices buzzing)

12:02.240 --> 12:05.220
- Everyone okay?
- Oh, husbands!

12:05.220 --> 12:08.320
- This is all very sweet,
but I'm trying not to die

12:08.320 --> 12:11.445
so if we could figure that out.

12:11.445 --> 12:14.760
- (sighs) Caliban has gotten
to level three terraforming

12:14.760 --> 12:17.670
so plenty of air, but
the scenery ain't great.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.316
- (sighs) Link said there
was a base built here.

12:20.316 --> 12:21.796
I'm assuming it was dropped from orbit

12:21.796 --> 12:26.050
by the last mining mission
but it could be habitable.

12:26.050 --> 12:30.120
- So what, we walk to
this base, this A-119?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.610
- What base?

12:31.610 --> 12:33.560
I thought the last mission was automated.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.840
- Might have been left for
a later mining expedition.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.136
- And if that's where the attack from?

12:39.136 --> 12:42.514
- (sighs) Kidd, can we fix
the ship with what's here?

12:42.514 --> 12:44.720
- (chuckles) Fix?

12:44.720 --> 12:48.100
Maybe, fly back to the
space lanes. (grunts)

12:48.100 --> 12:50.453
- And this base Link detected, is it safe?

12:51.307 --> 12:52.140
- 50-50?

12:52.140 --> 12:55.930
- 50-50, I'd say more like 25-75, but hey.

12:55.930 --> 12:58.210
I ain't the acting captain, so.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.610
Link?

12:59.610 --> 13:00.710
- Is there a question?

13:01.690 --> 13:04.467
- Man, I've had pocket
calculators more useful than you.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.617
- (sigh) Let's figure
out a plan of action.

13:10.021 --> 13:11.370
(wind howling)

13:11.370 --> 13:12.486
- [Kidd] What are you doing?

13:12.486 --> 13:14.870
- [Chafe] I'm starting new
mining drones while we're gone.

13:14.870 --> 13:16.718
If we get back with a
hull full of dispersium,

13:16.718 --> 13:19.418
we'll all be able to retire
and clone a bunch of kids.

13:22.608 --> 13:24.140
- (sighs) I need to
ask you about something

13:24.140 --> 13:25.560
strange that happened.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.393
- Go on.

13:28.510 --> 13:31.070
- We were hit with something,
some sort of blast,

13:31.070 --> 13:34.730
but whatever it was gave
me a hell of a migraine.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.500
- Did you hit your head?

13:36.500 --> 13:38.580
- No, people need to stop asking me that.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.410
I don't think so.

13:40.410 --> 13:43.670
But even if I did, that's
not the weird part.

13:43.670 --> 13:46.253
I've been having visions.

13:47.330 --> 13:48.710
- Visions of what?

13:49.910 --> 13:53.583
- Cloaked figures,
masked figures, and Link.

13:56.032 --> 13:58.023
- Link what?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.950
Acting Captain, are
you all right to serve?

14:02.950 --> 14:06.000
- Stop calling me that,
Raven was the captain.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.950
- But you are the one who has
to get us through this, Babs.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.270
- [Babylon] I'm just
asking, Chief Engineer,

14:12.270 --> 14:14.830
is it possible that we were
hit with a psychic blast?

14:14.830 --> 14:18.180
- That's like saying a
magic wand can fly the ship.

14:18.180 --> 14:20.231
There's no psychic ability that we know of

14:20.231 --> 14:22.380
of that magnitude.

14:22.380 --> 14:24.203
- No human psychic power.

14:25.070 --> 14:29.560
- This mining operation is
automated by robotics, Babs.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.040
Those were the mission specs.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.250
- I guess you've always
trusted the Pangaea Supergov

14:34.250 --> 14:35.383
more than I do.

14:35.383 --> 14:37.360
I don't think we ever
got a straight answer

14:37.360 --> 14:40.462
on what made Raven sick
after that last repair run.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.420
- (sighs) The Supergov
doctors said she had a

14:42.420 --> 14:44.680
predetermined genetic inclination.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.321
It had nothing to do with
whatever we ran into on Triton.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.969
- Genetic inclination is a funny way

14:49.969 --> 14:51.910
of saying it wasn't their fault.

14:51.910 --> 14:53.569
- You're jumping at shadows.

14:53.569 --> 14:54.503
- Am I?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.560
- So, this dispersium
stuff's the real deal, huh?

15:01.698 --> 15:03.775
- Well, if you mean dispersium can be used

15:03.775 --> 15:06.533
as an energy source for
all types of engines, yeah.

15:07.410 --> 15:09.650
- I wouldn't know about that,
I'm just a space jockey.

15:09.650 --> 15:11.130
You're the route guy.

15:11.130 --> 15:13.690
All I know is this
chick back at Tycho City

15:13.690 --> 15:15.560
had some crushed up dispersium,

15:15.560 --> 15:17.100
wanted me to snort it with her

15:17.100 --> 15:18.744
the night before we shipped out.

15:18.744 --> 15:19.580
(device beeping)

15:19.580 --> 15:21.840
I mean, isn't the brain
just a wet machine?

15:21.840 --> 15:24.540
I didn't do it, I told her I don't snort

15:24.540 --> 15:26.913
crushed rocks up my nose, baby, but.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.120
- I wouldn't know anything about that.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.430
- Hey, you're right,
that's a lot of money.

15:32.430 --> 15:35.240
Seems odd that Pangaea would
pick a small group like us

15:35.240 --> 15:36.193
to do the mining.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.103
- It's a long way from home

15:38.103 --> 15:42.059
and there's a lot of bad
stories about this place.

15:42.059 --> 15:43.633
- Bad stories?

15:44.940 --> 15:47.650
- (sighs) Listen, we
did a lot of space runs

15:47.650 --> 15:49.324
before you joined up, Kondor.

15:49.324 --> 15:53.720
We lost our way from a repair
on Triton and there were a lot

15:53.720 --> 15:56.920
of engineers that said we
shouldn't go there either.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.765
- Who told you not to go there?

15:58.765 --> 16:01.771
(Chafe sighs)

16:01.771 --> 16:03.321
We're not finished on that one.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.573
- Everybody ready?

16:06.700 --> 16:07.923
- Do we got a choice?

16:09.408 --> 16:11.908
(tense music)

16:14.719 --> 16:17.302
(wind howling)

16:23.521 --> 16:26.271
(sand crunching)

16:36.451 --> 16:39.368
(mysterious music)

17:03.760 --> 17:05.895
- Transforming has proceeded by robotics

17:05.895 --> 17:08.200
for 20 Martian years.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.770
Oxygen levels are acceptable.

17:11.770 --> 17:14.540
- It ain't exactly the
pleasure domes of Vegas, is it?

17:14.540 --> 17:16.570
- We're miners, not pioneers.

17:16.570 --> 17:19.546
- Well, we don't want to end
up pioneers, let's say that.

17:19.546 --> 17:22.213
(eerie buzzing)

17:26.810 --> 17:28.628
- The mining drones are on the move.

17:28.628 --> 17:31.110
By the time we get the parts for the ship,

17:31.110 --> 17:33.710
we should be well on our way
for a full load of dispersium.

17:33.710 --> 17:35.058
- Let's do the same.

17:35.058 --> 17:37.641
(wind howling)

17:42.394 --> 17:45.144
(sand crunching)

18:02.090 --> 18:03.653
- Wait, hold up a second.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.301
- What is it?

18:07.154 --> 18:08.613
- It looks like trails.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.450
- I don't see any tracks.

18:11.450 --> 18:12.950
- I don't mean machine tracks.

18:15.176 --> 18:17.759
(wind howling)

18:21.200 --> 18:22.233
- Is it an animal?

18:23.856 --> 18:26.358
- Before the terraformers
landed here 20 years ago,

18:26.358 --> 18:28.390
there wasn't any oxygen.

18:28.390 --> 18:30.933
- I'd say it needed oxygen to survive.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.300
Link.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.843
- Is there a question, Crew member Kidd?

18:36.890 --> 18:40.630
- Are there any other
bases in that direction?

18:40.630 --> 18:44.053
- The only registered base is A-119.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.756
- And it's the direction
we were already going?

18:48.756 --> 18:50.093
- That is affirmative.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.490
- What's your point, Kidd?

18:53.490 --> 18:56.370
I know geography and I
can read surroundings,

18:56.370 --> 18:58.490
and no machine made this.

18:58.490 --> 19:02.180
- Calm down, I hate to see
Daddies and Mommy fight.

19:02.180 --> 19:04.200
- Curiouser and curiouser.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.267
We need to check this out.

19:05.267 --> 19:06.940
- That's what guns are for.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.398
- Let's go.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.981
(wind howling)

19:16.282 --> 19:19.949
(distant, eerie vocalizing)

19:26.651 --> 19:29.401
(device beeping)

19:32.335 --> 19:34.682
(mysterious music)

19:34.682 --> 19:37.432
(device beeping)

19:39.966 --> 19:41.315
(ground blasting)

19:41.315 --> 19:44.315
(creature growling)

19:45.184 --> 19:46.463
(mysterious music)

19:46.463 --> 19:50.040
(creature growling)

19:50.040 --> 19:53.123
(mysterious buzzing)

20:02.559 --> 20:07.559
(sand crunching)
(wind howling)

20:28.260 --> 20:31.054
There's something up there.

20:31.054 --> 20:36.054
(sand crunching)
(wind howling)

20:48.880 --> 20:51.020
- So, we're not the
first humans on Caliban.

20:51.020 --> 20:53.420
- The mission launched 20 Earth years ago

20:53.420 --> 20:55.443
on the ship Sigrid Unset.

20:56.966 --> 20:58.920
The mission was to setup automation

20:58.920 --> 21:00.870
to begin mining dispersium.

21:02.836 --> 21:05.780
- I've flown the
spaceways for a long time,

21:05.780 --> 21:10.300
moon to moon, and I've never
heard of a Sigrid Unset.

21:10.300 --> 21:14.430
- Link, was the Sigrid Unset automated

21:14.430 --> 21:16.940
or was it under human power?

21:16.940 --> 21:18.237
- That information is not available

21:18.237 --> 21:19.843
from the Pangaea Supergov.

21:21.050 --> 21:23.638
- [Kondor] You gonna
answer already or what?

21:23.638 --> 21:26.221
(wind howling)

21:27.440 --> 21:31.240
- Link, was this station A-119 intended

21:31.240 --> 21:34.722
to be a workstation for human miners?

21:34.722 --> 21:36.312
- That information is not available

21:36.312 --> 21:37.683
from the Pangaea Supergov.

21:39.086 --> 21:41.420
- Are you finally ready
to slag this robot?

21:41.420 --> 21:45.000
- So, that's why there weren't
any bids on this place.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.555
I mean, I heard rumors in the spaceway

21:46.555 --> 21:49.570
but there are always
rumors in the spaceway.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.370
- Funny how much of that comes true.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.730
- [Chafe] I know I've
seen this stuff before.

21:55.730 --> 21:58.059
- So, the Sigrid Unset
didn't drop all the equipment

21:58.059 --> 22:00.330
and drones from orbit.

22:00.330 --> 22:03.452
Somebody came down here
and started it all up.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.835
- [Chafe] This is why they
used the ruddy old mining

22:04.835 --> 22:06.960
drones, all right.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.579
- Yeah, but how does
someone die holding one?

22:10.579 --> 22:14.420
- Maybe this person had
an accident or an injury.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.830
- No space burial?

22:15.830 --> 22:17.450
I don't know a single space jockey

22:17.450 --> 22:19.508
that someone would leave dirt-side.

22:19.508 --> 22:22.900
(alarm blaring)

22:22.900 --> 22:23.853
- Well, damn.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.060
- Great, well, I'm guessing
he just killed himself.

22:29.060 --> 22:30.370
Seriously?

22:30.370 --> 22:33.183
- Try turning it off
then turning it back on.

22:33.183 --> 22:35.933
- I hate it when the tech guys say that.

22:35.933 --> 22:39.232
(eerie groaning)

22:39.232 --> 22:41.563
- What the hell was that?

22:41.563 --> 22:44.042
- Someone took down our ship?

22:44.042 --> 22:45.197
- That's weird.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.236
- It's coming from the ground not the sky!

22:47.236 --> 22:48.069
Run!

22:48.069 --> 22:49.258
(dramatic music)

22:49.258 --> 22:52.949
(ground blasting)
(creature growling)

22:52.949 --> 22:53.782
Run!

22:54.632 --> 22:57.638
(Chafe screams)
Chafe, no!

22:57.638 --> 22:58.975
(weapon blasting)

22:58.975 --> 23:00.438
- Juice that bastard!

23:00.438 --> 23:05.438
(weapons blasting)
(creature roaring)

23:07.886 --> 23:12.599
(creature roaring)
(weapons blasting)

23:12.599 --> 23:15.291
- Acting Captain, we gotta go.

23:15.291 --> 23:17.275
(weapons blasting)

23:17.275 --> 23:19.823
(creature roaring)

23:19.823 --> 23:21.253
(Link buzzing)

23:21.253 --> 23:22.490
- Is Link?
- Wait.

23:22.490 --> 23:23.679
- We might need it.

23:23.679 --> 23:26.692
- I am honored, Acting Captain Babylon.

23:26.692 --> 23:28.404
(thrilling music)

23:28.404 --> 23:31.321
(creature roaring)

23:34.952 --> 23:39.952
(creature roaring)
(creature screeching)

23:43.461 --> 23:46.294
(thrilling music)

23:53.336 --> 23:54.850
- What was that thing?

23:54.850 --> 23:56.520
- Whatever it was, a snake, a worm,

23:56.520 --> 23:59.150
it was the mining
equipment that drew it out.

23:59.150 --> 24:00.444
- How?

24:00.444 --> 24:03.440
- (sighs) It must have been
attracted to the sound.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.060
I didn't see any eyes
on that thing, did you?

24:06.060 --> 24:07.890
- I only saw teeth.

24:07.890 --> 24:09.437
- [Kidd] Then it must have been sonar.

24:09.437 --> 24:11.633
- What, you're a zoologist now?

24:11.633 --> 24:15.300
- I'm being logical,
Kondor, try it sometime.

24:15.300 --> 24:17.370
- I got this far on instinct, gearhead.

24:17.370 --> 24:19.210
- Will both of you shut up?

24:19.210 --> 24:23.367
Link, were there any indigenous
creatures on Caliban?

24:23.367 --> 24:27.793
- It was not reported
to the Pangaea Supergov.

24:28.937 --> 24:32.816
- So, the whole crew died before
they got to send a report.

24:32.816 --> 24:34.905
It's been that way since the beginning.

24:34.905 --> 24:36.113
- It's looking that way.

24:37.410 --> 24:38.792
- And now the government waits 20 years

24:38.792 --> 24:40.283
to send another crew.

24:41.230 --> 24:44.000
So, it's all just a bunch
of spaceways rumors.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.310
- It doesn't matter, we lost a husband.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.950
It's just the two of
us now, don't you see?

24:49.950 --> 24:51.813
- It doesn't have to be that way.

24:52.975 --> 24:56.720
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, easy, easy.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.488
We can mourn our husband soon,

24:59.488 --> 25:02.510
but right now we gotta get to that base,

25:02.510 --> 25:05.940
get to ground, and figure
out what that was out here.

25:05.940 --> 25:06.773
Link.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.080
Are we still on track for A-119?

25:11.080 --> 25:12.813
- Negative, Crew member Kidd.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.555
- Can we get back on track?

25:16.555 --> 25:19.576
- Affirmative, Crew member Kidd.

25:19.576 --> 25:22.409
(thrilling music)

25:28.205 --> 25:30.788
(wind howling)

25:35.215 --> 25:36.165
(static buzzing)

25:36.165 --> 25:39.582
(tense electronic music)

25:58.777 --> 25:59.684
(static buzzing)

25:59.684 --> 26:02.517
(energy whirring)

26:07.218 --> 26:09.831
(static buzzing)

26:09.831 --> 26:11.945
(light buzzing)

26:11.945 --> 26:13.570
(static buzzing)

26:13.570 --> 26:15.733
- My husband, my wife.

26:17.330 --> 26:20.230
Do not fight the inhabitants.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.943
Do not try to leave Caliban.

26:24.260 --> 26:26.333
We can all be together once more.

26:28.060 --> 26:31.193
We must embrace the world
that we are making together.

26:32.204 --> 26:33.037
(static buzzing)

26:33.037 --> 26:35.870
(energy whirring)

26:40.036 --> 26:43.944
(energy whirring)
(energy buzzing)

26:43.944 --> 26:44.950
(static buzzing)

26:44.950 --> 26:46.773
- This is Oracle,

26:47.611 --> 26:50.820
the official holder of The Book of Changes

26:50.820 --> 26:53.730
for the Caliban mission.
(static buzzing)

26:53.730 --> 26:56.873
I have thrown three coins six times.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.143
I have read the upper and lower trigrams.

27:02.400 --> 27:06.332
This reading is for
those who come after us,

27:06.332 --> 27:09.767
who survive us.
(energy whirring)

27:09.767 --> 27:11.542
(wind howling)

27:11.542 --> 27:15.125
(uptempo electronic music)

27:43.166 --> 27:46.249
(mysterious buzzing)

27:49.030 --> 27:50.897
- Where did that come from?

27:52.549 --> 27:54.466
It's that damn android!

27:55.657 --> 27:58.187
- Link, status report.

27:58.187 --> 28:00.529
- This unit seems to have sustained damage

28:00.529 --> 28:02.437
in the indigenous beam attack.

28:03.551 --> 28:06.040
(mysterious buzzing)

28:06.040 --> 28:07.560
- He better shut that switch off

28:07.560 --> 28:10.411
before I nail him down
and do a dinner plate.

28:10.411 --> 28:13.310
- Like I said, we might need this android.

28:13.310 --> 28:15.960
Link, shut off external sounds.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.742
- [Link] That would include
my vocal parameters,

28:17.742 --> 28:20.947
Acting Captain Babylon.
(Link buzzing)

28:20.947 --> 28:23.530
- Finally, some good news!

28:23.530 --> 28:26.498
- So, we're still on track to the base.

28:26.498 --> 28:28.146
- Recalculating.

28:28.146 --> 28:31.667
- Recalculating, damn, so
this thing broke its GPS.

28:31.667 --> 28:34.500
(ground rumbling)

28:36.300 --> 28:37.410
- Damn it!

28:37.410 --> 28:42.410
(ground blasting)
(creature roaring)

28:43.244 --> 28:47.297
(ground blasting)
(creature growling)

28:47.297 --> 28:48.163
Damn it!

28:48.163 --> 28:49.020
- Burn it fast!

28:49.020 --> 28:54.020
(weapons blasting)
(creatures groaning)

28:55.458 --> 28:58.375
(weapons blasting)

29:00.775 --> 29:05.775
(weapons blasting)
(flames roaring)

29:07.018 --> 29:12.018
(weapons blasting)
(creatures groaning)

29:15.520 --> 29:16.870
- Think we got it?

29:16.870 --> 29:18.650
- It's ass wasn't totally on fire

29:18.650 --> 29:20.450
so I don't think we got it.

29:20.450 --> 29:22.590
We better use our inside voices.

29:22.590 --> 29:24.497
- Do you have a new lock on A-119?

29:27.740 --> 29:29.590
- Are you really gonna trust his ass?

29:30.426 --> 29:31.637
- It's the only way.

29:35.606 --> 29:38.523
(eerie vocalizing)

29:39.436 --> 29:44.436
(sand crunching)
(wind howling)

29:49.107 --> 29:51.857
(device buzzing)

29:56.042 --> 30:01.042
(wind howling)
(sand crunching)

30:08.276 --> 30:11.026
(device buzzing)

30:18.395 --> 30:20.123
- Fine, so if this damn
thing's finally broken,

30:20.123 --> 30:22.730
dibs on using its head as a salad bowl.

30:25.953 --> 30:26.995
(thrilling music)

30:26.995 --> 30:29.610
- Link, turn your voice back on.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.163
Status report, quietly.

30:32.195 --> 30:34.130
(electricity whirring)

30:34.130 --> 30:37.253
- We have arrived at location A-119.

30:38.384 --> 30:40.884
- Damn it, so this thing
is broken, we're screwed.

30:42.790 --> 30:45.350
I mean, what, it's just gone?

30:45.350 --> 30:46.723
- If it was a module dropped from a ship

30:46.723 --> 30:49.428
it could have gotten moved somewhere.

30:49.428 --> 30:51.413
- Was that a question?

30:51.413 --> 30:53.580
- Damn it, Link, yes,
consider that a question.

30:53.580 --> 30:58.203
- A-119 was not dropped from
the atmosphere, it was built.

30:59.430 --> 31:03.540
- Okay, so if it was built
by humans or even bots

31:03.540 --> 31:05.793
there had to be a foundation somewhere.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.083
- Damn!

31:09.083 --> 31:11.583
(tense music)

31:14.300 --> 31:16.130
- There's a hatch over
there, help me move it.

31:16.130 --> 31:18.690
- Uh, could be anything down there.

31:18.690 --> 31:20.480
- Probably more skeletons.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.473
- It ain't the dead I'm worried about.

31:24.712 --> 31:29.712
(wind howling)
(sand crunching)

31:29.926 --> 31:32.593
(ominous music)

31:36.896 --> 31:41.278
(energy buzzing)
(door clatters)

31:41.278 --> 31:43.945
(ominous music)

32:03.992 --> 32:07.159
(footsteps pattering)

32:19.644 --> 32:21.269
(creature roaring)

32:21.269 --> 32:24.436
(footsteps pattering)

32:30.867 --> 32:33.534
(ominous music)

32:48.623 --> 32:51.717
(latch clatters)
(door creaks)

32:51.717 --> 32:53.035
- Relax.

32:53.035 --> 32:55.702
(door creaking)

32:58.460 --> 33:02.614
(Kidd chuckles)
(door creaks)

33:02.614 --> 33:05.864
(electricity whirring)

33:17.637 --> 33:20.554
(mysterious music)

33:27.690 --> 33:29.120
- Just more junk.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.807
- Wait, I feel like there
might be some answers

33:30.807 --> 33:32.520
here somewhere.

33:32.520 --> 33:33.621
- If you can make
something out of this crap,

33:33.621 --> 33:35.530
you're a better engineer than I am.

33:35.530 --> 33:37.745
- That's not saying much.

33:37.745 --> 33:41.328
(bright, mysterious music)

34:10.081 --> 34:12.316
Come on, sweetheart.

34:12.316 --> 34:15.733
(computer keys clicking)

34:17.080 --> 34:20.663
(bright, mysterious music)

34:23.400 --> 34:25.174
(computer keys clicking)

34:25.174 --> 34:28.007
(buttons beeping)

34:31.730 --> 34:32.857
- This is Oracle,

34:34.060 --> 34:36.820
the official holder of The Book of Changes

34:36.820 --> 34:38.293
for the Caliban mission.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.807
I have thrown the three coins six times.

34:46.807 --> 34:47.780
(static buzzing)

34:47.780 --> 34:50.423
I have read the upper and lower trigrams.

34:51.696 --> 34:54.833
This reading is for
those who come after us,

34:56.260 --> 34:57.153
who survive us.

34:59.340 --> 35:01.320
- Who survive us?

35:01.320 --> 35:04.044
I wonder if the Oracle thought
it'd be 20 years later.

35:04.044 --> 35:05.573
- The ship had an oracle?

35:06.456 --> 35:09.440
- (sighs) 20 years ago, bigger
crews often had a member

35:09.440 --> 35:11.170
who could read the I Ching.

35:11.170 --> 35:13.150
The old captain swore by it.

35:13.150 --> 35:14.126
- I mean I knew it happened,

35:14.126 --> 35:17.741
I just never crewed a ship with an oracle.

35:17.741 --> 35:20.150
- All right, you two figure this out.

35:20.150 --> 35:21.096
I'm an old space jockey.

35:21.096 --> 35:23.996
I don't like being down here
with nobody watching my segs.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.342
I don't want to be down in a hole

35:26.342 --> 35:29.033
with nobody watching the only way in.

35:30.190 --> 35:31.173
- You do that then.

35:34.185 --> 35:37.102
(mysterious music)

35:38.140 --> 35:41.310
When I served on the Leonardo
Padoro we had an oracle.

35:41.310 --> 35:43.017
- I didn't know that ship had an oracle.

35:43.017 --> 35:44.610
What was that like?

35:44.610 --> 35:47.210
- She was never wrong, if
that's what you're asking.

35:50.400 --> 35:55.273
- Hidden dragon, dragon
appearing in a field.

35:56.210 --> 35:58.632
Dragons fight in the meadow.

35:58.632 --> 36:01.033
Their blood is black and yellow.

36:02.550 --> 36:07.550
Horse and wagon parked, bloody tears flow.

36:08.070 --> 36:11.823
Wading in the mud brings about
the arrival of the enemy.

36:13.110 --> 36:14.393
Wading in blood.

36:15.516 --> 36:17.183
Get out of the pits!

36:18.598 --> 36:21.515
(mysterious music)

36:26.559 --> 36:29.892
(mysterious vocalizing)

36:38.456 --> 36:41.373
(mysterious music)

36:46.327 --> 36:49.044
(energy whooshing)
(static buzzing)

36:49.044 --> 36:51.627
(wind howling)

37:04.851 --> 37:07.768
(mysterious music)

37:10.625 --> 37:12.292
Get out of the pits!

37:14.522 --> 37:16.189
Get out of the pits!

37:19.294 --> 37:21.877
(wind howling)

37:27.764 --> 37:30.514
(device beeping)

37:34.380 --> 37:37.020
- After we get home, I'm
taking a milk run to Venus.

37:37.020 --> 37:38.203
Screw this shit.

37:39.632 --> 37:42.299
(ominous music)

37:45.060 --> 37:47.620
Those oracles will mess with your mind.

37:47.620 --> 37:50.357
I don't dick around
with that I Ching shit.

37:50.357 --> 37:53.274
(eerie vocalizing)

37:55.112 --> 37:57.557
Now, that's more like it.

37:57.557 --> 38:00.470
It's one thing to shoot
a giant worm with teeth.

38:00.470 --> 38:03.123
It's another to shoot a guy
in a mask with a bathrobe.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.770
(eerie buzzing)

38:06.770 --> 38:08.542
All right, buddy, I gave you a chance.

38:08.542 --> 38:10.476
Not much of one, but.

38:10.476 --> 38:13.309
(weapon blasting)

38:15.224 --> 38:18.141
(eerie vocalizing)

38:19.966 --> 38:22.799
(energy whirring)

38:27.599 --> 38:31.432
(mysterious electronic music)

38:36.509 --> 38:39.176
(eerie buzzing)

38:40.380 --> 38:44.213
(mysterious electronic music)

38:46.472 --> 38:49.139
(eerie buzzing)

38:52.332 --> 38:56.165
(mysterious electronic music)

39:28.577 --> 39:32.005
- The one-eyed man is able to see.

39:32.005 --> 39:35.630
A lame man is able to tread,

39:35.630 --> 39:38.920
but he treads on the tail of the tiger.

39:38.920 --> 39:42.016
The tiger bites the man,

39:42.016 --> 39:45.531
and thus is the reading
of The Book of Changes.

39:45.531 --> 39:48.281
(static buzzing)

39:50.460 --> 39:51.293
- Well?

39:52.130 --> 39:54.063
- Keep both eyes open for a start.

39:55.576 --> 39:56.409
- Nothin'.

40:00.029 --> 40:02.612
(Link buzzing)

40:03.491 --> 40:05.991
(tense music)

40:07.200 --> 40:10.611
(eerie vocalizing)

40:10.611 --> 40:13.278
(eerie buzzing)

40:14.289 --> 40:18.420
(eerie, mysterious music)

40:18.420 --> 40:20.540
Hey, there's something up here.

40:20.540 --> 40:22.276
Let's check it out.

40:22.276 --> 40:25.776
(eerie, mysterious music)

40:27.426 --> 40:30.593
(footsteps pattering)

40:34.560 --> 40:35.890
Jackpot.

40:35.890 --> 40:37.571
- Looks like 20 year old junk.

40:37.571 --> 40:39.490
- Oh, I wouldn't call it 20 year old junk,

40:39.490 --> 40:40.810
but it's 20 year old something.

40:40.810 --> 40:42.500
- But will it work?

40:42.500 --> 40:43.483
- It's worth a try.

40:44.561 --> 40:46.163
- Well, it's all we got, Kidd.

40:46.163 --> 40:47.900
- Then I guess it has to work.

40:49.786 --> 40:52.297
(static buzzing)

40:52.297 --> 40:55.689
- The one-eyed man is able to see.

40:55.689 --> 40:58.473
A lame man is able to tread,

40:59.590 --> 41:02.920
but he treads on the tail of the tiger.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.753
The tiger bites the man.

41:05.753 --> 41:09.850
And thus is the reading
of The Book of Changes.

41:09.850 --> 41:10.690
(static buzzing)

41:10.690 --> 41:15.443
- My husband, my wife,
don't fight the inhabitants.

41:16.550 --> 41:18.990
Don't try to leave Caliban.

41:18.990 --> 41:21.362
We can all be together once more.

41:21.362 --> 41:24.112
(static buzzing)

41:26.776 --> 41:30.238
(mysterious music)

41:30.238 --> 41:31.071
- Keep.

41:32.028 --> 41:32.861
Chuck.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.260
Keep.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.780
Chuck.

41:36.780 --> 41:40.642
Ooh, this little buddy is our ticket

41:40.642 --> 41:42.800
back to the spaceways.

41:45.340 --> 41:47.823
- Good, I was hoping this
wasn't a one-way trip.

41:48.717 --> 41:53.717
(device beeping)
(device buzzing)

41:58.507 --> 42:03.507
(ground blasting)
(creature roaring)

42:04.137 --> 42:05.002
(thrilling music)

42:05.002 --> 42:06.040
- It can't be.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.861
- Turn it off, Kidd.

42:07.861 --> 42:10.694
(ground rumbling)

42:12.191 --> 42:15.596
(thrilling music)

42:15.596 --> 42:16.429
- Run!

42:17.311 --> 42:18.728
(wall exploding)

42:18.728 --> 42:19.681
Run!

42:19.681 --> 42:22.699
- No! (screams)

42:22.699 --> 42:25.699
(creature growling)

42:27.715 --> 42:30.548
(thrilling music)

42:31.675 --> 42:32.880
Let's go, Link!

42:32.880 --> 42:34.900
- Activating Protocol Nine.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.390
- Link!

42:36.390 --> 42:38.788
- Activating Protocol Nine.

42:38.788 --> 42:42.020
Protocol Nine activated.
(creature growling)

42:42.020 --> 42:44.853
(energy whirring)

42:59.022 --> 43:02.278
(energy whirring)

43:02.278 --> 43:05.753
(energy whirring)
(energy buzzing)

43:05.753 --> 43:07.421
- It's gone.

43:07.421 --> 43:09.794
- [Link] Protocol Nine activated.

43:09.794 --> 43:11.310
- Link?

43:11.310 --> 43:12.143
- No.

43:12.143 --> 43:14.801
(thrilling music)

43:17.168 --> 43:20.085
(eerie vocalizing)

43:22.460 --> 43:23.293
Babylon.

43:24.344 --> 43:26.920
(Babylon panting)

43:26.920 --> 43:28.393
Babs, it's me.

43:29.830 --> 43:31.683
Babs, it's Kidd.

43:39.012 --> 43:40.656
- Kidd?

43:40.656 --> 43:41.489
How?

43:42.390 --> 43:46.060
- Before we left Mars, I
uploaded a copy of my brainwaves

43:46.060 --> 43:48.559
into a personality circuit in Link.

43:48.559 --> 43:51.994
Then I slaved that circuit
into my biorhythm monitor

43:51.994 --> 43:54.363
so it would only kick in if I died.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.743
So, I'm dead, right, Babs?

43:59.858 --> 44:02.820
- (sighs) Yes, you're dead.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.260
- I did the upload before we left Mars

44:07.260 --> 44:10.248
so I don't know what's
happened since then.

44:10.248 --> 44:11.930
Are we on Caliban?

44:13.825 --> 44:16.703
- (sighs) We're in the base
built by the first mission.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.685
- And the rest of the crew?

44:19.685 --> 44:22.445
- Kondor's watching the
backdoor to this place.

44:22.445 --> 44:27.445
Chafe was killed by the same
creatures that killed you.

44:28.170 --> 44:29.390
- Creatures?

44:29.390 --> 44:30.883
- Some kind of giant worm.

44:31.810 --> 44:35.250
- Seems like a crappy way
to die on a space mission.

44:35.250 --> 44:38.853
- Well, these worms have
teeth, if that helps.

44:39.890 --> 44:40.883
- I guess it does.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.033
So, we lost Chafe and Raven this year?

44:45.349 --> 44:49.599
Four have become two, maybe
a little less than two.

44:51.285 --> 44:54.045
- (sighs) Let's not think
like that right now.

44:54.045 --> 44:56.450
You're here in some way.

44:56.450 --> 44:57.973
You're still Kidd in some way.

44:58.880 --> 45:02.035
- You're right, of course you're right.

45:02.035 --> 45:05.180
- (sighs) Right now we need
to get back to the ship.

45:05.180 --> 45:06.650
- Well, the good thing is that I'm also

45:06.650 --> 45:08.720
connected to our ship.

45:08.720 --> 45:11.230
It needs repairs.

45:11.230 --> 45:15.331
But I can see the schematics
so clearly even from here.

45:15.331 --> 45:17.833
I think I can fix it.

45:17.833 --> 45:20.220
- That's good 'cause the
parts you were needing

45:20.220 --> 45:22.890
from here went down that creature's mouth.

45:22.890 --> 45:26.720
- Along with me, the flesh me.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.963
- Kidd.

45:27.963 --> 45:31.530
- No, you're right,
this is actually better.

45:31.530 --> 45:34.790
The mathematics of the universe
are so clear to me now.

45:34.790 --> 45:36.480
I should have downloaded my personality

45:36.480 --> 45:38.237
into an android long ago.

45:39.959 --> 45:42.626
(Babylon sighs)

45:44.994 --> 45:46.089
(wind howling)

45:46.089 --> 45:49.006
(eerie vocalizing)

45:50.524 --> 45:53.024
(tense music)

46:06.340 --> 46:08.830
You said Kondor was
watching this entrance?

46:08.830 --> 46:09.870
- Yeah.

46:09.870 --> 46:12.150
Maybe he headed back to the ship.

46:12.150 --> 46:13.800
- Why would he go without us?

46:13.800 --> 46:16.784
- I don't know, we'll just
ask him when we find him.

46:16.784 --> 46:19.284
(tense music)

46:23.700 --> 46:25.400
- That isn't a good sign, Babs.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.252
He wouldn't have dropped that on purpose.

46:27.252 --> 46:29.900
- Then we need to catch up
to him, sooner than later.

46:29.900 --> 46:31.048
Let's go, Kidd.

46:31.048 --> 46:33.631
(quirky music)

46:38.530 --> 46:40.970
- [Kidd] I'm in touch, with the ship.

46:40.970 --> 46:45.970
We're not far away, she's
eager to be reunited with us.

46:46.850 --> 46:49.182
- [Babylon] Don't forget
who you're married to.

46:49.182 --> 46:52.099
(eerie vocalizing)

46:54.682 --> 46:57.182
(tense music)

47:03.526 --> 47:06.443
(eerie vocalizing)

47:08.500 --> 47:12.240
I'm Captain Babylon from
mining shop Robert Indiana,

47:12.240 --> 47:13.728
flying a Martian flag.

47:13.728 --> 47:15.586
We mean no harm.

47:15.586 --> 47:18.169
(wind howling)

47:19.820 --> 47:23.003
We ran into some creatures
and lost two crew members.

47:24.490 --> 47:27.122
We are just trying to
get back to our ship.

47:27.122 --> 47:29.763
We didn't know there were
other inhabitants here.

47:32.327 --> 47:35.535
Were your people here
when the first ship came,

47:35.535 --> 47:37.323
the Sigrid Unset?

47:40.050 --> 47:42.463
Did you know the crew
from the Sigrid Unset?

47:43.510 --> 47:46.000
Did you know the Oracle from that ship?

47:46.000 --> 47:47.970
Do you know what happened to the crew?

47:47.970 --> 47:49.907
Are any of them still alive?

47:49.907 --> 47:52.310
We are here in peace!

47:52.310 --> 47:54.820
We just want to get back to our ship.

47:54.820 --> 47:56.583
This is a peaceful mission.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.820
- If we don't get out of
here, it won't be, come on.

48:05.011 --> 48:07.928
(eerie vocalizing)

48:09.844 --> 48:12.594
(energy buzzing)

48:17.268 --> 48:19.727
(tense music)

48:19.727 --> 48:22.243
(energy whirring)

48:22.243 --> 48:24.826
(wind howling)

48:26.740 --> 48:28.518
We gotta go back down below.

48:28.518 --> 48:29.543
- It's a dead end.

48:33.375 --> 48:36.013
- We're dead if we stay up here, Babs.

48:36.870 --> 48:39.283
It's the only way, we gotta try.

48:41.496 --> 48:43.719
(tense music)

48:43.719 --> 48:46.386
(door creaking)

48:47.680 --> 48:49.283
They quit following us.

48:49.283 --> 48:51.190
- Whatever they are.

48:51.190 --> 48:52.860
We can't stay down here forever.

48:52.860 --> 48:55.670
- I know that, Babs, but
we need to figure out

48:55.670 --> 48:58.920
who and what those beings are first.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.290
Maybe there are some more files

49:00.290 --> 49:03.340
on that data station we
came across back there.

49:03.340 --> 49:05.730
In this form, I might
be able to dig deeper

49:05.730 --> 49:07.081
than I could before.

49:07.081 --> 49:08.631
- (sighs) Let's give it a shot.

49:12.130 --> 49:13.783
- [Raven] Babylon, Kidd.

49:16.125 --> 49:17.393
Babylon.

49:18.482 --> 49:19.315
Kidd.

49:21.530 --> 49:24.013
My wife, my husband.

49:25.100 --> 49:27.100
- [Kidd] That sounds like.

49:27.100 --> 49:28.100
- Raven?

49:28.100 --> 49:29.900
- [Raven] You have to stop fighting.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.000
- No.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.123
- [Raven] I'm waiting for you.

49:36.460 --> 49:41.460
- That's Raven, but that doesn't compute.

49:41.830 --> 49:44.880
- [Raven] Caliban is waiting for you.

49:44.880 --> 49:48.210
- No, Raven would never
tell us to stop fighting.

49:48.210 --> 49:49.503
- Does not compute.

49:51.673 --> 49:53.090
Does not compute.

49:56.079 --> 49:58.996
(eerie vocalizing)

50:11.610 --> 50:14.360
(device beeping)

50:22.720 --> 50:24.330
- Hold it together,
Kidd, I still need you.

50:24.330 --> 50:25.653
- I will.

50:29.878 --> 50:32.795
(mysterious music)

50:41.156 --> 50:43.906
(static buzzing)

50:45.940 --> 50:47.520
- Anything?

50:47.520 --> 50:51.063
- This base is only sleeping.

50:53.330 --> 50:55.823
- Beyond the trauma of human failure,

50:56.750 --> 51:00.389
lies the stillness of cosmic wisdom.

51:00.389 --> 51:04.443
When people with poor wisdom
tread among sleeping tigers,

51:05.418 --> 51:07.623
they shall meet with disaster.

51:08.733 --> 51:10.883
- Can you change the
channel on that thing?

51:11.874 --> 51:13.510
(device beeping)
(static buzzing)

51:13.510 --> 51:15.603
- My husband, my wife.

51:16.610 --> 51:17.443
- Raven?

51:18.540 --> 51:20.170
Raven?

51:20.170 --> 51:22.802
- Don't fight the inhabitants.

51:22.802 --> 51:25.193
Don't try to leave Caliban.

51:26.290 --> 51:29.223
We can all be together again.

51:30.600 --> 51:32.717
- Kidd, that can't be Raven.

51:32.717 --> 51:35.810
- My logic circuits are not registering.

51:35.810 --> 51:38.200
- But it just can't be.

51:38.200 --> 51:40.720
- We must all embrace the world

51:40.720 --> 51:43.635
that we are making together.
- Raven.

51:43.635 --> 51:44.468
Raven.

51:46.121 --> 51:47.919
(electricity crackling)

51:47.919 --> 51:48.857
- Kidd!

51:48.857 --> 51:51.791
(loud buzzing)

51:51.791 --> 51:54.366
What now?
(electricity crackling)

51:54.366 --> 51:55.199
Kidd!

51:56.162 --> 51:58.252
Kidd, no!
(loud buzzing)

51:58.252 --> 52:00.214
(loud buzzing)

52:00.214 --> 52:02.319
Kidd, I can't lose you a second time.

52:02.319 --> 52:03.624
You're all that's left.

52:03.624 --> 52:05.105
- I...

52:05.105 --> 52:07.755
I can feel the circuits fading.

52:07.755 --> 52:08.588
- No.

52:09.914 --> 52:13.472
- But it doesn't hurt, Babs.

52:13.472 --> 52:16.017
- It's, it's hurting me!

52:16.017 --> 52:19.658
- Babylon, let me tell you something.

52:19.658 --> 52:23.600
I downloaded my consciousness into Link,

52:23.600 --> 52:25.328
but I also downloaded my consciousness

52:25.328 --> 52:27.233
into a probe on the ship.

52:28.203 --> 52:31.890
It launched when my first body died.

52:31.890 --> 52:33.273
It's beyond Pluto now.

52:34.510 --> 52:36.093
Beyond Hydra now.

52:37.290 --> 52:39.110
It's beyond Styx now.

52:39.110 --> 52:40.833
- Kidd, stay with me!

52:40.833 --> 52:45.169
- I am beyond any place any
human mind has ever seen.

52:45.169 --> 52:48.203
Babs, there are other human beings

52:48.203 --> 52:50.703
out here beyond human knowledge.

52:52.320 --> 52:53.470
I'm going to know them.

52:54.338 --> 52:59.338
(distorted) One day
you may know them, too.

53:00.470 --> 53:03.053
(Kidd buzzing)

53:04.686 --> 53:06.290
(Babylon sighs)

53:06.290 --> 53:08.130
(loud whirring)

53:08.130 --> 53:10.713
One day you may know them, too.

53:16.901 --> 53:19.651
(device beeping)

53:23.617 --> 53:25.407
But I also downloaded my consciousness

53:25.407 --> 53:28.518
into a probe on the ship.

53:28.518 --> 53:31.581
It launched when my first body died.

53:31.581 --> 53:34.916
(eerie vocalizing)

53:34.916 --> 53:37.567
(mysterious music)

53:37.567 --> 53:40.150
(wind howling)

53:44.088 --> 53:46.838
(static buzzing)

53:49.980 --> 53:53.147
(mysterious whirring)

53:54.748 --> 53:58.050
(dramatic thudding)

53:58.050 --> 54:00.700
- I don't know how to kill
you or if you can even die,

54:00.700 --> 54:02.533
but I have to try, don't I?

54:02.533 --> 54:04.263
I don't have anything else left.

54:06.330 --> 54:07.245
You're not just the inhabitants

54:07.245 --> 54:09.570
of this half-formed planet.

54:09.570 --> 54:13.053
You are, you are the
original crew, aren't you?

54:17.800 --> 54:20.230
The worms are the native species.

54:20.230 --> 54:22.130
You don't have anything to do with it!

54:24.077 --> 54:25.763
What happened to you?

54:33.535 --> 54:36.285
(static buzzing)

54:41.039 --> 54:43.706
What did they do to you, Kondor?

54:46.493 --> 54:48.683
What did they do to your brain?

54:49.950 --> 54:51.963
- They did nothing.

54:53.960 --> 54:55.598
- No!

54:55.598 --> 55:00.423
- The minerals we're mining, the dust.

55:01.780 --> 55:05.503
It's in the air, it gets in your brain.

55:07.580 --> 55:12.123
It works on your brain, we're evolving.

55:17.736 --> 55:19.319
And it's beautiful.

55:20.700 --> 55:24.093
- It's, it's not you anymore, Kondor!

55:25.430 --> 55:28.130
It's not human, it's alien!

55:28.130 --> 55:30.714
It's not evolution at all.

55:30.714 --> 55:35.714
- It's better, I'm better than human now,

55:36.170 --> 55:37.383
and you will be, too.

55:38.750 --> 55:40.220
- No.

55:40.220 --> 55:41.903
- You will join us.

55:43.120 --> 55:47.343
When the next mission
comes, whenever it comes,

55:49.359 --> 55:53.183
we will welcome them, too.

55:54.780 --> 55:57.693
- No, there won't be anymore missions!

56:00.000 --> 56:01.550
- There will be a next mission,

56:02.990 --> 56:04.993
even if it is in 20 years.

56:07.106 --> 56:08.973
The minerals here are too valuable.

56:10.470 --> 56:13.660
- When the government knows
what these minerals can do...

56:13.660 --> 56:14.693
- They already know.

56:17.104 --> 56:20.170
There will be another
mission and another mission.

56:23.966 --> 56:26.508
And we will grow stronger.

56:26.508 --> 56:27.341
- No!

56:30.590 --> 56:31.423
Goodbye.

56:32.900 --> 56:34.663
- This is not goodbye.

56:36.382 --> 56:39.355
(weapon blasting)

56:39.355 --> 56:42.580
(light whirring)

56:42.580 --> 56:46.288
You were a good pilot, Kondor,
despite the rest of it!

56:46.288 --> 56:49.205
(eerie vocalizing)

56:51.262 --> 56:54.012
(static buzzing)

56:56.365 --> 56:59.282
(eerie vocalizing)

57:00.660 --> 57:02.487
- [Raven] Listen to him, Babylon.

57:03.423 --> 57:05.623
Come back to us!

57:07.580 --> 57:09.743
My husband, my wife.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.273
Do not fight the inhabitants.

57:14.250 --> 57:16.753
Do not try to leave Caliban.

57:18.270 --> 57:20.813
We can all be together once more.

57:22.070 --> 57:25.833
We must embrace the world
that we are making together.

57:27.720 --> 57:30.103
You have to be ready.

57:31.670 --> 57:34.580
You have to stop fighting.

57:34.580 --> 57:36.453
I'm waiting for you.

57:37.380 --> 57:42.157
Caliban is waiting for you.
(eerie vocalizing)

57:43.418 --> 57:46.085
(ominous music)

57:49.701 --> 57:51.701
- The simulation's over.

57:53.346 --> 57:54.554
- What?

57:54.554 --> 57:57.134
- The simulation's over.

57:57.134 --> 58:00.240
- What, what are you saying?

58:00.240 --> 58:02.150
- [Raven] Listen to him, Babylon!

58:02.150 --> 58:04.823
Come back to us!

58:06.170 --> 58:09.090
Do not fight the inhabitants.

58:09.090 --> 58:11.573
Do not try to leave Caliban.

58:13.120 --> 58:15.388
We can all be together once more.

58:15.388 --> 58:16.449
(Babylon panting)

58:16.449 --> 58:17.282
- No!

58:17.282 --> 58:18.900
- [Raven] We must
embrace the world that we

58:18.900 --> 58:20.752
are making together.

58:20.752 --> 58:23.585
(thrilling music)

58:24.735 --> 58:29.735
(weapon blasting)
(dramatic whooshing)

58:31.921 --> 58:35.088
(explosions blasting)

58:42.360 --> 58:47.360
(eerie whirring)
(wind howling)

58:52.390 --> 58:53.223
- Run!

58:55.164 --> 58:55.997
Run!

59:01.923 --> 59:05.855
- This is the mining ship Robert Indiana

59:05.855 --> 59:10.855
from the port of Elysium Mons
and flying the Martian flag.

59:12.565 --> 59:16.540
Calling on Caliban.

59:16.540 --> 59:20.957
Again, this is the Robert
Indiana under Martian flag,

59:22.988 --> 59:25.071
calling the moon Caliban.

59:26.640 --> 59:30.768
We have a license to repair
and maintain the mining

59:30.768 --> 59:35.768
equipment under authorization
from the Pangaea Supergov.

59:38.721 --> 59:40.266
(static buzzing)

59:40.266 --> 59:41.099
No!

59:43.449 --> 59:46.366
(mysterious music)

59:48.710 --> 59:49.543
Kidd?

59:51.644 --> 59:53.553
- Acting Captain Babylon.

59:55.246 --> 59:56.230
- I...

59:56.230 --> 59:59.437
I'm on Mars?

59:59.437 --> 1:00:02.519
(devices buzzing)

1:00:02.519 --> 1:00:07.519
(device beeping)
(wind howling)

1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:13.240
- We are in the training
center at Olympus Mons.

1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:17.060
You have been in deep REM VR.

1:00:17.060 --> 1:00:19.893
Your orientation to reality
should return momentarily.

1:00:22.471 --> 1:00:25.337
- We were supposed to go to Caliban.

1:00:25.337 --> 1:00:28.480
- The Pangaea Supergov required your crew

1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:31.330
to simulate the mission
first for viability.

1:00:31.330 --> 1:00:35.153
Result, the simulation of
the mining mission to Caliban

1:00:35.153 --> 1:00:36.427
is over.

1:00:36.427 --> 1:00:38.353
The mission will be a failure.

1:00:40.430 --> 1:00:41.790
- A failure.

1:00:41.790 --> 1:00:44.943
- You have returned to reality,
Acting Captain Babylon.

1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:48.363
Are you in operating status?

1:00:49.770 --> 1:00:51.071
- I'm okay.

1:00:51.071 --> 1:00:54.010
Good thing we ran that simulation.

1:00:54.010 --> 1:00:56.503
But there were a lot of
weird glitches in there.

1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:59.710
- Acting Captain Babylon,

1:00:59.710 --> 1:01:02.412
those with strong emotions, a strong will,

1:01:02.412 --> 1:01:06.090
can sometimes overwhelm the simulation.

1:01:06.090 --> 1:01:09.953
It is clear from your simulation
that you and your husbands

1:01:09.953 --> 1:01:13.260
are not ready to return to space flight

1:01:13.260 --> 1:01:16.963
since the death of your first
wife and captain, Raven.

1:01:18.653 --> 1:01:20.302
- No, that's not all of it.

1:01:20.302 --> 1:01:22.889
There were those weird people on Caliban.

1:01:22.889 --> 1:01:24.777
What was that about?

1:01:24.777 --> 1:01:27.803
- An extrapolation of scenarios.

1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:33.060
- So, there was an original
human crew sent to Caliban,

1:01:33.060 --> 1:01:34.612
like in the simulation.

1:01:34.612 --> 1:01:37.060
(devices beeping)

1:01:37.060 --> 1:01:38.643
- It can be extrapolated.

1:01:39.829 --> 1:01:41.885
- And what happened to them?

1:01:41.885 --> 1:01:44.050
(devices beeping)

1:01:44.050 --> 1:01:46.560
- That cannot be extrapolated from data

1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:48.243
supplied by the Pangaea Supergov.

1:01:50.026 --> 1:01:52.563
- (sighs) Well, that sounds familiar.

1:01:55.020 --> 1:01:56.270
Where are Kidd and Chafe?

1:01:57.370 --> 1:01:59.523
- Just finishing their own simulations.

1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:02.620
- I need to see them.

1:02:02.620 --> 1:02:03.460
We...

1:02:04.410 --> 1:02:06.380
We need time together.

1:02:06.380 --> 1:02:09.743
- Acting Captain Babylon, a
reminder that the simulation

1:02:09.743 --> 1:02:12.920
will fade from your mind in a short time.

1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:14.291
The scenario you experienced

1:02:14.291 --> 1:02:17.670
in the simulation was
just that, a simulation.

1:02:19.244 --> 1:02:23.059
- That's good, there's
a lot I want to forget.

1:02:23.059 --> 1:02:25.993
But maybe a few things good to remember.

1:02:27.515 --> 1:02:30.985
(device droning)

1:02:30.985 --> 1:02:32.193
Husbands!

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:39.190
- How did you guys do?

1:02:39.190 --> 1:02:41.440
In my simulation, the
engines kept conking out

1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:43.364
and we never even made it to the planet.

1:02:43.364 --> 1:02:46.110
- In my simulation, the
mining drones hadn't gotten

1:02:46.110 --> 1:02:48.460
far enough into the
terraforming to sustain us.

1:02:50.490 --> 1:02:51.713
- How about you, Babs?

1:02:53.978 --> 1:02:57.927
- The planet was hostile,
we didn't make it.

1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:00.960
- Wow.

1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:03.283
So, I guess we all had a total party kill.

1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:05.780
- I survived mine.

1:03:09.380 --> 1:03:11.500
- Well, it's a good thing
the Supergov gave us these

1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:14.140
simulations before they
gave us the contract.

1:03:14.140 --> 1:03:16.263
Saved everybody a lotta time.

1:03:17.470 --> 1:03:18.630
- Yeah.

1:03:18.630 --> 1:03:20.800
Guess we weren't ready for Caliban.

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:21.960
- I'll tell you what, we'll keep looking

1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:25.080
for another repair contract,
maybe the other direction,

1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:26.440
towards Sol. (chuckles)

1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:28.610
I wouldn't mind being warm for a change.

1:03:28.610 --> 1:03:29.970
- Sure.

1:03:29.970 --> 1:03:32.567
But where's Kondor?

1:03:36.630 --> 1:03:37.463
- Who's Kondor?

1:03:39.505 --> 1:03:40.793
- Nevermind.

1:03:42.780 --> 1:03:45.483
- Seems like your simulation
was a little rough.

1:03:46.490 --> 1:03:48.900
- Mine just had some weird stuff in it.

1:03:48.900 --> 1:03:49.973
Raven was there.

1:03:52.166 --> 1:03:53.093
- Raven?

1:03:58.430 --> 1:04:00.600
- Yeah, hey, don't worry about it.

1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:03.150
The important thing is
that we're all together.

1:04:03.150 --> 1:04:04.390
- What else would we be?

1:04:04.390 --> 1:04:07.653
After Raven, now more than ever.

1:04:07.653 --> 1:04:09.403
- Now more than ever.

1:04:12.170 --> 1:04:13.853
Thank you, Link.

1:04:13.853 --> 1:04:14.977
(eerie vocalizing)

1:04:14.977 --> 1:04:17.833
(light whooshing)

1:04:17.833 --> 1:04:21.879
(eerie electronic music)

1:04:21.879 --> 1:04:24.595
(light whooshing)

1:04:24.595 --> 1:04:28.012
(eerie electronic music)

1:04:35.925 --> 1:04:38.758
(light whooshing)

1:04:39.660 --> 1:04:42.493
Link, is this real?

1:04:44.550 --> 1:04:46.223
- Is that a question?

1:04:48.977 --> 1:04:49.810
- No.

1:04:51.390 --> 1:04:53.140
- Acting Captain Babylon,

1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:55.893
are you returned to operating status?

1:04:58.985 --> 1:05:00.200
(mysterious music)

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.393
- [Raven] My husband, my wife.

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:06.810
Don't fight the inhabitants.

1:05:06.810 --> 1:05:08.713
Don't try to leave Caliban.

1:05:09.930 --> 1:05:13.084
We can all be together once more.

1:05:13.084 --> 1:05:15.917
(devices beeping)

1:05:17.253 --> 1:05:19.836
(wind howling)

1:05:24.383 --> 1:05:27.300
(mysterious music)

1:05:43.352 --> 1:05:45.935
(wind howling)

1:05:59.782 --> 1:06:02.699
(eerie vocalizing)

1:06:03.594 --> 1:06:04.654
(static buzzing)

1:06:04.654 --> 1:06:08.404
(energetic electronic music)

1:07:01.517 --> 1:07:04.850
(energetic vocal music)

1:07:26.815 --> 1:07:30.565
(energetic electronic music)

1:10:04.185 --> 1:10:05.657
(static buzzing)
