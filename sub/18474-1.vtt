01:01.200 --> 01:03.848
I'm here to see Rod McCain.

01:03.948 --> 01:05.870
Willa Weston.

01:10.909 --> 01:13.226
I'm not gettin' an answer.

01:13.326 --> 01:15.662
You'll have to wait, ma'am.

01:15.762 --> 01:18.830
I'm starting work here today,
and I can't be late.

01:18.930 --> 01:20.735
Can I help?

01:20.835 --> 01:22.400
I don't think so.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.104
Could you try Mr. McCain's assistant
again, please?

01:25.204 --> 01:27.441
I already did, ma'am.

01:27.541 --> 01:29.607
You sure I can't help?

01:29.707 --> 01:31.913
Am I not on the list?

01:32.013 --> 01:35.615
Don't worry, Bill. I'll take her up.
She's from the White House.

01:35.715 --> 01:38.068
Whatever you say, Mr. McCain.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.323
Vince McCain. I'm the son.

01:42.423 --> 01:45.504
This way. You are?

01:46.448 --> 01:49.530
Willa Weston.
I'm here to manage WOCT networks.

01:49.630 --> 01:51.536
And you are vice president
of marketing.

01:51.636 --> 01:55.317
Yes, but mostly I just
wait for my father to die.

01:56.458 --> 01:58.707
What was that thing
about the White House?

01:58.807 --> 02:01.309
I was just changing
his perception of the situation.

02:01.409 --> 02:03.315
First law of marketing.

02:03.415 --> 02:07.962
So, what would you like to know about
the most powerful man alive?

02:12.142 --> 02:15.201
Around here, he's known
as "Rod Almighty."

02:17.114 --> 02:19.229
Wait right here.

02:19.329 --> 02:21.066
He called me.

02:21.166 --> 02:23.814
I'll be right out.
He called me.

02:26.957 --> 02:28.875
Hi, Neville. How's it going?

02:28.975 --> 02:31.005
Rod's busy.

02:31.105 --> 02:32.905
Yes. Yes.

02:34.399 --> 02:37.284
Oh, yeah! Oh, God.

02:37.384 --> 02:39.998
Oh, God. Oh, yes!

02:45.043 --> 02:47.394
I did it. I did the deal.

02:47.494 --> 02:49.228
One-four-five?

02:49.328 --> 02:52.132
One-three-bloody-eight. Hit me.

02:52.232 --> 02:54.651
You bloody beauty!

02:56.221 --> 02:58.156
Way to go, Dad! We did it again!

02:59.158 --> 03:01.172
- Oh, it's you.
- Dad, can I introduce...

03:01.272 --> 03:03.376
I don't have time.
I'm late for the finance meeting.

03:03.476 --> 03:05.212
- But, Dad...
- Shut up.

03:05.312 --> 03:07.311
- What do we do about Detroit?
- Close it.

03:07.411 --> 03:08.493
It's done.

03:15.508 --> 03:17.224
Call me Rod.

03:17.324 --> 03:19.094
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

03:19.194 --> 03:21.763
- Dad, I'd like to introduce...
- Just signed a beautiful deal.

03:21.863 --> 03:24.268
Alliance Leisure, U.K.
The sweetest part is...

03:24.368 --> 03:26.900
I snatched it from under the nose
of that bastard Murdoch.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.906
- What are the crown jewels?
- Northeast Television...

03:29.006 --> 03:30.469
and Great British Publishing.

03:30.569 --> 03:34.744
There's a film distribution company,
14 multiplexes, some bingo halls...

03:34.844 --> 03:38.649
- Three ice rinks, a crematorium...
- Nice little owner, that, and a zoo.

03:38.749 --> 03:40.651
- A zoo?
- Yep.

03:40.751 --> 03:42.850
Gotta go, Willa. Finance meeting.

03:42.950 --> 03:47.272
Back, Neville. So, make a lot
of money for me at...

03:48.879 --> 03:51.094
- WOCT.
- Sorry.

03:51.194 --> 03:53.599
- What?
- Sold it this morning.

03:53.699 --> 03:55.601
Don't worry.
We'll find something for ya.

03:55.701 --> 03:57.619
Talk to you later.

04:00.857 --> 04:02.776
- That's it?
- That's Dad.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.778
- You mean I don't have a job?
- Look, Willa...

04:04.878 --> 04:07.877
- I just gave up a vice presidency.
- No worries, Willa.

04:07.977 --> 04:10.648
We've got lots of jobs.
We're always expanding.

04:10.748 --> 04:13.086
Neville, check our liability
on the Detroit pension rights.

04:13.186 --> 04:16.072
- Righto.
- Vince, go away.

04:19.144 --> 04:21.124
- Where are my grapes?
- I'm sorry, Mr. McCain.

04:21.224 --> 04:23.362
I wanted grapes!

04:23.462 --> 04:25.098
It was a natural mistake.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.482
I wanted grapes. Get the fruit.

04:33.592 --> 04:36.477
- What's going on at that zoo?
- What zoo?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.514
The one you just acquired
in Britain.

04:38.614 --> 04:40.847
We put in a guy from Octopus TV,
Hong Kong.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.615
Hard-nosed little Chinese bastard
called Lee.

04:43.715 --> 04:47.089
He used to bein the Hong Kong police.
Speaks good English, but...

04:47.189 --> 04:50.093
- Big cats over there, right?
- Yes.

04:50.193 --> 04:53.062
And small mammal house there.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.897
- That's right.
- Good.

04:55.997 --> 04:57.597
Mammals.

04:58.001 --> 05:00.465
Have you any background in animals?

05:00.565 --> 05:03.285
Well, I've eaten a lot, you know.
Sorry.Joke.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.152
Good evening.

05:13.836 --> 05:17.722
Now, for those of you who have
not met me yet, my name is Rollo Lee...

05:17.822 --> 05:23.195
and as of yesterday morning,
I have assumed command of this zoo...

05:23.295 --> 05:28.181
and I shall be reporting to our new
owners, Octopus, Inc., of Atlanta.

05:28.984 --> 05:32.736
Now, Octopus, of course,
is owned by Mr. Rod McCain, who...

05:32.836 --> 05:36.742
as I'm sure you were aware,
is a remarkable man.

05:36.842 --> 05:40.146
Starting with his father's
radio stations in New Zealand...

05:40.246 --> 05:43.346
he has built up a global empire...

05:43.446 --> 05:47.551
currently worth more than
six billion dollars...

05:47.651 --> 05:49.489
and growing.

05:49.589 --> 05:52.190
How much does he want in the end?

05:52.290 --> 05:53.290
Yeah.

05:53.890 --> 05:57.230
- What?
- How much bigger does he wanna get?

05:57.330 --> 05:59.767
Well, there aren't any limits.
He wants growth.

05:59.867 --> 06:02.602
Presumably, he's aware
of Dr. E.F. Schumacher's...

06:02.702 --> 06:06.507
concept of limited resources or,
as Jean-Paul Sartre puts it...

06:06.607 --> 06:08.842
Any sensible questions? Yes.

06:08.942 --> 06:11.522
- Are you going to close the zoo?
- Yeah.

06:13.633 --> 06:15.780
I'm very glad you asked me that.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.119
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

06:18.219 --> 06:20.433
- No, you're not.
- Now, look.

06:21.274 --> 06:23.192
This zoo has to make money.

06:23.292 --> 06:24.458
It does.

06:24.558 --> 06:26.794
- Yes, yes, but not enough.
- Enough for what?

06:26.894 --> 06:28.798
Now, don't...

06:28.898 --> 06:31.100
Actually, I will tell you precisely.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.504
Mr. McCain requires
a 20% return on capital...

06:35.604 --> 06:39.071
from each and every asset
in his empire.

06:39.171 --> 06:40.627
Why 20%?

06:41.830 --> 06:43.944
Because he does, that's why.

06:44.044 --> 06:45.950
Could we explore
that thinking a little?

06:46.050 --> 06:47.050
Yeah.

06:49.171 --> 06:50.420
I thought not.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.158
Despite the fact that current
management theory regards...

06:52.258 --> 06:53.006
Despite the fact that current
management theory regards...

06:53.106 --> 06:56.261
Now, the big problem is this:
How do we cut costs...

06:56.361 --> 06:59.326
and attract more visitors?

06:59.426 --> 07:02.897
I'll tell you from my experience
at Octopus Television...

07:02.997 --> 07:07.151
exactly what draws the biggest
audiences all over the world.

07:11.195 --> 07:13.477
Violence. Oh, yes.

07:13.577 --> 07:17.012
Mr. Sylvester Stallone
did not get where he is today...

07:17.112 --> 07:19.019
by playing in Jane Austen.

07:19.119 --> 07:21.285
- What's that got to do with it?
- Therefore, in this zoo...

07:21.385 --> 07:25.590
we require only animals
that are potentially violent.

07:25.690 --> 07:28.156
Fierce animals.

07:28.256 --> 07:31.261
All the rest, I'm afraid,
will have to go.

07:31.361 --> 07:33.268
What d'you mean, go?

07:33.368 --> 07:36.833
- We'll have to find them other homes.
- What? Outside the zoo?

07:36.933 --> 07:39.003
This zoo is dedicated
to conservation.

07:39.103 --> 07:42.808
- Yes.
- I am all in favour of conservation...

07:42.908 --> 07:46.343
and the three things that I
want to conserve are this zoo...

07:46.443 --> 07:49.352
your jobs and fierce animals.

07:49.452 --> 07:52.484
He barges in here without
the slightest idea of what...

07:52.584 --> 07:54.923
- You two don't seem very upset.
- We are, really.

07:55.023 --> 07:57.224
- Because your animals are fierce?
- No, we think it's...

07:57.324 --> 08:00.196
- Diabolical.
- What does he mean by "fierce"?

08:00.296 --> 08:02.998
A giraffe can kick a man's head off,
but you wouldn't call them "fierce."

08:03.098 --> 08:05.300
It's the same
with sea lions and penguins.

08:05.400 --> 08:10.119
I mean, people don't think of them
as violent, but they can be killers.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.442
Why have you all gone quiet?

08:19.944 --> 08:22.363
Are you trying to tell me
that coati is fierce?

08:22.463 --> 08:25.995
Please! This is a wild animal.
It's not domesticated.

08:26.095 --> 08:28.535
You take a liberty with one of these
things, they give you a very nasty nip.

08:28.635 --> 08:32.203
A safety pin would give me a nasty nip.

08:32.304 --> 08:36.143
I'll tell you what's fierce.
Fierce is biting the whole hand off.

08:36.243 --> 08:37.842
- The whole hand?
- Thank you.

08:37.943 --> 08:40.179
It is all right
if it wrenches the hand off?

08:40.279 --> 08:42.650
Oh, yes, fine.

08:42.751 --> 08:46.320
Lotterby, could I have
a word with you, please?

08:46.420 --> 08:49.326
- These are your meerkats, correct?
- Don't do that, please, sir.

08:49.426 --> 08:52.594
- They go straight for the throat.
- This new plaque of yours...

08:52.694 --> 08:54.598
says that they're known as
"The Piranhas of the Desert."

08:54.698 --> 08:55.762
Is that right?

08:55.862 --> 08:58.065
They can strip a human
carcass in three minutes.

08:58.165 --> 09:02.703
My encyclopedia says they're
easily tamed and often kept as pets.

09:02.803 --> 09:05.107
You've not been attacked
by one, sir.

09:05.207 --> 09:07.374
Nobody's been attacked
by one, Lotterby...

09:07.474 --> 09:10.612
or, rather, if they have,
they never noticed.

09:10.712 --> 09:14.314
Now, these Patagonian maras of yours...

09:14.414 --> 09:17.552
devastate entire
Argentinian villages, do they?

09:17.652 --> 09:19.557
They completely wipe 'em out, sir.
Shocking to watch.

09:19.657 --> 09:21.575
It says here they eat grass.

09:22.744 --> 09:25.027
That's for hors d'oeuvres, sir.
When their blood's up...

09:25.127 --> 09:27.065
Lotterby, you are trying
to deceive me into thinking...

09:27.165 --> 09:30.367
- some of your animals are fierce...
- I'm talkin' about the rogue ones, sir.

09:30.467 --> 09:34.841
when they are, in fact, loveable, cuddly
and surplus to requirements.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.843
You want ever animal here a psycho?

09:36.943 --> 09:40.312
Exactly. I want
a lethal weapon in every cage.

09:40.412 --> 09:44.060
- So what do we do with all the others?
- Simple. Get rid of'em.

09:54.746 --> 09:56.893
- Willa, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

09:56.993 --> 09:59.175
- Are those breasts real?
- Yes.

10:04.490 --> 10:07.105
You know, Willa, you better be careful
dressed like that around here.

10:07.205 --> 10:10.308
People will think you're
sleeping your way to the top.

10:10.408 --> 10:13.455
Just as long as they don't think
I'm sleeping my way to the middle.

10:16.336 --> 10:17.916
What are you doing?

10:18.016 --> 10:20.456
I'm going to ask your father
if I can go run the zoo.

10:20.556 --> 10:21.556
What?

10:22.424 --> 10:24.760
You want to go to the Third World
and operate an animal toilet?

10:24.860 --> 10:28.860
Animals, paper clips, television
companies. It's all business.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.632
Willa, these things smell.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.869
With enough zoos up and running,
we are talking billions.

10:34.969 --> 10:37.638
Wow! How about dinner tonight?
You can wear your office clothes.

10:37.738 --> 10:41.342
No, I have to get up early.
I'm pitching it to Rod in the morning.

10:41.442 --> 10:43.347
- What's the hurry?
- I don't want to give our ruthless...

10:43.447 --> 10:46.580
little Chinese friend
time to make an impact.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.485
I dare say they are upset,
Di, but I have a job to do.

10:49.585 --> 10:52.922
- Yes, I know, but I...
- Look, I have to be hard-nosed, okay?

10:53.022 --> 10:58.192
McCain demands it. All the time,
you've got to be tough, tough, tough.

10:58.292 --> 10:59.698
God knows why.

10:59.798 --> 11:01.579
You mean Octopus is ruled by fear?

11:03.686 --> 11:05.502
No, no. Terror.

11:05.602 --> 11:09.184
I've got this one chance to show that
I can run something or I'm out...

11:10.260 --> 11:13.809
and at my age, scrap heap.

11:13.909 --> 11:16.912
Mr. Lee, there's a call
from Atlantis.

11:17.012 --> 11:19.717
- Atlantis?
- Atlanta.

11:19.817 --> 11:21.051
Hello. Lee here.

11:21.151 --> 11:24.233
Rollo, Nev here.
Rod would like a word with you.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.193
That's right.
The wife and kids settled in yet?

11:28.293 --> 11:31.260
Yes. Everything's absolutely
terrified here, thanks.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.267
Sir, how kind of you to ask.

11:33.367 --> 11:35.533
Rollo, Rod here.
Got the wife and kids settled in?

11:35.633 --> 11:37.233
Yes, yes, yes, sir.

11:37.333 --> 11:41.505
Let me know what you're gonna do to push
earnings up to our favourite 20%, okay?

11:41.605 --> 11:45.209
It's marvelous to have this opportunity
of explaining what I've got in mind.

11:45.309 --> 11:48.847
- Hello, Rollo?
- Hello again, Mr. McCain.

11:48.947 --> 11:52.185
It's Nev, mate. So the wife and kids
are settled in all right?

11:52.285 --> 11:54.189
Look, I don't want to seem awkward...

11:54.289 --> 11:56.191
but I'm not married
and I haven't got any children.

11:56.291 --> 11:57.754
What happened to Rod?

11:57.854 --> 12:01.291
He's been called away.
So let Rod know your plans, okay?

12:01.391 --> 12:03.299
Zoos are not moneymakers, Willa.

12:03.399 --> 12:06.533
Mr. McCain, with good marketing,
cash comes walking in the gate...

12:06.633 --> 12:08.701
and with sponsorships, even more cash.

12:08.801 --> 12:10.768
That was my idea, Dad.
I've got several lined up already.

12:10.868 --> 12:15.306
Just think of it as a prototype
for a chain of cash cows.

12:15.406 --> 12:17.315
Sort of a cash dairy, eh?

12:17.415 --> 12:18.415
Sort of a cash dairy, eh?

12:26.775 --> 12:31.358
This inclination towards absolutism
within the Austro-Hungarian empire.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.380
C.B. Wedgewood in...

12:40.756 --> 12:42.781
Yes? Come in.

12:47.097 --> 12:48.086
Yes?

12:48.186 --> 12:50.814
- Here are the animals, sir.
- What animals?

12:50.914 --> 12:53.515
The first batch of animals
that are definitely not fierce, sir.

12:53.615 --> 12:55.415
Ah, good.

12:58.708 --> 12:59.666
Yes?

12:59.766 --> 13:03.293
We tried to place them
with other zoos. No takers.

13:03.393 --> 13:07.464
Do you mean of all the zoos in this
country, you can't find a single one...

13:07.564 --> 13:10.436
Zoos are keeping
less and less species, sir.

13:10.536 --> 13:13.941
Well, what about having people
take them as pets?

13:14.041 --> 13:16.140
- Pets?
- Oh, come on, now.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.113
They need expert attention.

13:18.213 --> 13:21.515
Anyway, it's not allowed, sir.
Quarantine regulations.

13:21.615 --> 13:24.985
Well, can we release them
back into the wild?

13:25.085 --> 13:28.040
In the wild, there's no
safe habitat for this one.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.123
What do you propose?

13:32.223 --> 13:35.996
There's only one solution, Mr. Lee.
What the London Zoo proposed...

13:36.096 --> 13:38.130
a few years ago when the government
wouldn't give any more funds.

13:38.230 --> 13:40.378
- What was that?
- Shoot 'em.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.370
Are you seriously telling me...

13:45.470 --> 13:47.777
there's no other way of getting rid
of these animals?

13:47.877 --> 13:49.077
Not...

13:50.278 --> 13:52.378
unless you were to change
the Fierce Animal Policy.

13:52.478 --> 13:53.478
Nope.

13:53.815 --> 13:55.826
You sure about that
in the circumstances, sir?

13:57.805 --> 13:59.419
Perfectly sure, thank you.

13:59.519 --> 14:02.427
- They're very dear creatures.
- That's not in dispute.

14:02.527 --> 14:04.430
But you would like them killed
in line with your policy?

14:04.530 --> 14:08.062
If you really have explored
all the other avenues, yes.

14:08.162 --> 14:11.570
I mean, if extermination
is the only choice, so be it.

14:11.670 --> 14:13.539
I'm sorry, but I see no alternative.

14:13.639 --> 14:15.540
The Fierce Animal Policy...

14:15.640 --> 14:17.705
is absolutely essential...

14:17.805 --> 14:21.111
for the continuing survival of...

14:21.211 --> 14:23.311
- What are you doing?
- Well, it's just that...

14:23.411 --> 14:26.251
we'd rather not shoot them
ourselves, sir.

14:26.351 --> 14:28.416
- We're very fond of them.
- We're keepers...

14:28.516 --> 14:32.066
and now we're not keeping them.

14:33.510 --> 14:36.070
Oh, I see.
I'm shooting them, am I?

14:36.946 --> 14:39.595
- If it's not too much trouble.
- No, no, fine.

14:39.695 --> 14:43.619
Do you have my diary there?
Thank you.

14:44.755 --> 14:47.770
You will make it quick, sir,
won't you?

14:47.870 --> 14:50.441
Do you mean I'm not allowed to
torture them a bit first just for fun?

14:50.541 --> 14:53.780
- You wouldn't do that!
- I wasn't being serious, stupid girl!

14:53.880 --> 14:56.751
Hardly the time for jokes.

14:56.851 --> 14:58.803
Bye-bye, Suzie.

14:59.705 --> 15:01.056
Bye-bye, Petal.

15:01.156 --> 15:02.732
I tried.

15:05.145 --> 15:07.442
Be brave, Mitzi.

15:09.148 --> 15:10.739
Bye, Rollo.

15:11.784 --> 15:13.931
I'd prefer it
if you called me "Director."

15:14.031 --> 15:17.081
I was talking to the lemur!

15:18.058 --> 15:20.606
The lemur is called "Rollo"?

15:20.706 --> 15:24.790
She named him after you.
It was a mark of respect.

15:33.006 --> 15:34.769
Would you pass
the marmalade, please?

15:39.782 --> 15:43.183
You should have seen his face when he
realized he was supposed to shoot them.

15:44.453 --> 15:48.003
Without wishing to detract from your
award-winning performances...

15:48.103 --> 15:52.308
may I be so bold as to inquire
what you hope to achieve by this prank?

15:52.408 --> 15:55.246
It wasn't a prank, Bugsy. We're tryin'
to confront him with the reality.

15:55.346 --> 15:59.116
If you paint him into a corner,
you'll find that he will...

15:59.216 --> 16:02.216
Shut up. He's not
a cold-blooded murderer.

16:02.316 --> 16:06.401
We've given him the five sweetest,
cuddliest, most loveable...

16:53.594 --> 16:56.010
- I told you so.
- Shut up!

16:56.110 --> 16:59.064
Bugsy, he'll start on yours next.

17:20.550 --> 17:22.097
- Yes?
- Hello, Rollo.

17:22.196 --> 17:24.199
- Yes?
- Vince here. How you doin'?

17:24.299 --> 17:28.269
- You having dinner?
- Dinner? It's 2:00 in the morning.

17:28.368 --> 17:30.277
Oh, were you asleep?

17:30.377 --> 17:32.779
Yes, I frequently am
at2:00a.m., I'm afraid.

17:32.879 --> 17:35.215
Filthy habit I picked up
in the Far East.

17:35.315 --> 17:38.415
Gee, if this communique
is in anyway sleep-interruptive...

17:38.515 --> 17:41.984
- I'll re-telephone you later.
- It's not sleep-interruptive, really.

17:42.084 --> 17:46.068
Let's chat now. I can always catch up
on some rest. Christmas probably.

17:49.514 --> 17:52.130
- Right.
- Good. Let's talk marketing, shall we?

17:52.230 --> 17:54.298
- Good.
- Yeah. First thing tomorrow...

17:54.398 --> 17:57.468
I'd like you to send me the most current
marketing figures you've got, okey doke?

17:57.568 --> 17:58.768
Right.

17:59.906 --> 18:01.276
Rollo, hi.

18:01.376 --> 18:03.279
Willa Weston here.
Are you all right?

18:03.379 --> 18:05.457
No, no. Not now. Not now.

18:06.366 --> 18:08.846
- You got a problem with now?
- No, no. I'm fine.

18:08.946 --> 18:11.585
Don't do that.
Sorry. Hang on a moment.

18:11.685 --> 18:13.935
Suzie, be quiet.

18:15.008 --> 18:17.894
Hello? I'm going to put you
on hold just for one moment.

18:17.994 --> 18:19.469
Okay? Thank you.

18:21.749 --> 18:24.634
Another filthy habit
he picked up in the Far East.

18:24.734 --> 18:27.834
Now, you just go over there.
Right. Stay.

18:27.934 --> 18:29.537
Don't, don't, don't.
Just stop it.

18:29.637 --> 18:32.510
I've got to talk
with those marketing Moonies.

18:32.610 --> 18:35.513
Just go over there and play
with each other. Right. Go on.

18:35.613 --> 18:38.111
- He's got two girls.
- Go away, Suzie.

18:38.211 --> 18:40.430
Suzie, what are you
going down there for?

18:41.804 --> 18:44.398
No, stop licking my... Careful!

18:46.076 --> 18:48.055
Don't bite.

18:48.155 --> 18:50.237
No, I can't fool around with you now.

18:51.448 --> 18:53.630
Don't pull. Don't pull.

18:53.730 --> 18:56.832
Get... There.
There. Stay. Stay.

18:56.932 --> 18:58.871
Cindy, get off the bed.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.605
Cindy, off, off!

19:01.705 --> 19:04.375
- I don't want you now.
- Three girls?

19:04.475 --> 19:07.475
Cindy, go away!

19:07.677 --> 19:09.723
All right, all right.
Just go.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.736
Oh, that is disgusting.

19:18.777 --> 19:21.358
Sorry. I had a bit of a cramp.

19:21.458 --> 19:24.058
Hello? Hello!

19:26.319 --> 19:28.912
He must have eaten
a whole rhino horn.

19:30.323 --> 19:32.553
Now, there's a thought.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.558
I'll be right back.

19:37.497 --> 19:39.431
Take your time.

19:40.833 --> 19:43.097
How does he get three girls?

19:44.604 --> 19:47.038
Where does the third one go?

19:50.411 --> 19:52.011
Bastard.

19:52.159 --> 19:57.230
The place is probably crawling with
young, beautiful female zoo keepers.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.330
Damn!

20:00.554 --> 20:03.069
I hate it when people abuse
positions of trust...

20:03.169 --> 20:06.320
for their own personal,
sexual gratification.

20:09.097 --> 20:11.312
It's demeaning to women.

20:11.412 --> 20:14.618
- Tell me about the sponsorships.
- What sponsorships?

20:14.718 --> 20:17.286
The ones you told Rod about.

20:17.386 --> 20:20.639
- I made that up.
- Vince, I told...

20:22.045 --> 20:24.172
What are you doing?

20:25.248 --> 20:29.184
I'm getting undressed for sex.
I thought you were in the bedroom.

20:32.656 --> 20:35.608
I was getting us dinner.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.592
You wanna eat first?

20:48.206 --> 20:50.435
Oh, goody-goody. Goody.

20:54.078 --> 20:57.362
Vince, I invited you
here tonight...

20:57.462 --> 21:01.113
to say "thank you"
for helping me with Rod.

21:03.189 --> 21:06.407
Not to jump in the sack with you.

21:06.507 --> 21:10.360
Whoa, wait, wait...
What is the problem?

21:12.032 --> 21:14.213
I really like you.

21:14.313 --> 21:17.153
Who knows what might've happened?

21:17.253 --> 21:20.386
Oh, you mean if you weren't
going to England tomorrow?

21:20.486 --> 21:22.031
Exactly.

21:23.877 --> 21:25.969
Look, it's all right.
I understand.

21:26.946 --> 21:28.504
- Really?
- Yes.

21:29.749 --> 21:33.069
- You sure you're okay with this?
- Yes.

21:33.169 --> 21:35.246
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

21:37.358 --> 21:38.758
Thanks.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.722
'Cause I'm going with you.

21:44.031 --> 21:45.951
- What?
- Yes! Surprise!

21:46.051 --> 21:49.402
I talked to Rod, and he said
we could run the zoo together!

21:51.240 --> 21:52.440
Great!

21:55.912 --> 21:58.926
You're not gonna let him
go to Marwood Zoo?

21:59.026 --> 22:03.099
I know it's only 4,000 miles away,
Nev, but it's a start.

22:03.199 --> 22:06.668
Still, it's tough on Willa,
getting landed with the idiot son.

22:06.768 --> 22:09.473
She can manage him.
She's a natural-born corporate killer.

22:09.573 --> 22:11.478
Right this way, Mr. McCain.

22:11.578 --> 22:13.877
- You have the questions?
- Yes.

22:13.977 --> 22:15.897
Back, Nev.

22:17.267 --> 22:18.667
No. No.

22:21.051 --> 22:22.051
No!

22:23.590 --> 22:26.891
You better send a good
book keeper with him.

22:26.991 --> 22:29.070
He would never dare
try to steal again.

22:30.148 --> 22:32.066
Fakin' my signature.

22:32.166 --> 22:35.069
Not after what happened
to him last time.

22:35.169 --> 22:40.041
That's enough. You must be the
intellectuals. What do you wanna know?

22:40.141 --> 22:44.301
What about the 5,000 layoffs
if you close down in Chicago?

22:44.544 --> 22:45.681
If any employees were let go, it would
depend on second-quarter growth...

22:45.781 --> 22:48.482
If any employees were let go, it would
depend on second-quarter growth...

22:48.582 --> 22:52.937
because we don't wanna lose anyone
unless it is absolutely necessary.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.890
Weat Octopus are in the business
of job creation.

22:56.990 --> 23:00.796
Currently, we employ more
than 70,000people worldwide.

23:00.896 --> 23:05.396
Sometimes circumstances require
parts of the company to be relocated.

23:05.496 --> 23:09.286
It's inevitable in any business that's
going to face the competition, and...

23:18.267 --> 23:22.417
Scared? Don't worry about Terry.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

23:22.517 --> 23:24.854
Actually, he would hurt a fly
being a Mexican red knee tarantula...

23:24.954 --> 23:28.273
Brachypelmasmithi, and therefore
particularly partial to flies.

23:29.111 --> 23:31.362
The point is that Terry...

23:31.462 --> 23:35.267
has a bite relatively
harmless to human beings.

23:35.367 --> 23:38.287
Yet you reacted
as though he were fierce...

23:39.356 --> 23:40.788
which he isn't!

23:44.059 --> 23:46.575
Yes, I've always had a bit of a thing
about spiders, actually.

23:46.675 --> 23:51.214
So, if creatures
are thought to be fierce...

23:51.314 --> 23:54.532
they are, ipso facto, fierce!

23:55.106 --> 23:57.024
Sorry, Director.
We need the guns.

23:57.124 --> 23:59.120
- What?
- Animal has escaped. We must catch it.

23:59.220 --> 24:01.392
- We need three, sir.
- Tranquillizer darts?

24:01.492 --> 24:04.927
Gerry's got the blowpipe, sir.
We need the real thing just in case.

24:05.027 --> 24:07.985
- Okay, I'll get one too.
- Don't worry. We can handle this.

24:16.094 --> 24:18.012
Keep back, everybody.
Please, keep back.

24:18.112 --> 24:20.245
- What's going on?
- Just recapturing an animal.

24:20.345 --> 24:22.250
Nothing to worry about.
It's not fierce.

24:22.350 --> 24:24.482
Why have you got the guns then?

24:24.582 --> 24:27.022
Just a precaution. Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

24:27.122 --> 24:30.187
How did the black widow spider
get its name, Mr. Lee?

24:30.287 --> 24:32.472
Because it eats its mate.

24:34.314 --> 24:37.166
We've caught it, ladies and gentlemen,
so we can all relax.

24:37.266 --> 24:41.266
And thank you very much
for your cooperation. Thank you.

24:41.366 --> 24:44.802
Well done, everyone. Well done.

24:44.902 --> 24:46.811
- What is that?
- That is an anteater.

24:46.911 --> 24:48.814
Not too close! He's angry.

24:48.914 --> 24:50.815
- Angry?
- They got wicked tempers, sir.

24:50.915 --> 24:53.480
- Devastate small towns, do they?
- No, not...

24:53.580 --> 24:56.149
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Look at the claws. They're diabolical.

24:56.249 --> 24:58.521
Lotterby, you did not need
three guns to recapture this.

24:58.621 --> 24:59.899
A sharp stick would've sufficed.

24:59.999 --> 25:00.699
A sharp stick would've sufficed.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.497
A sharp stick?
Believe you me, sir, his jaws...

25:02.597 --> 25:04.768
It's an anteater, not a man-eater.

25:04.868 --> 25:07.335
What would you be saying
if he jumped into that pram?

25:07.435 --> 25:09.343
- What would you say to the child's mum?
- I'd be saying...

25:09.443 --> 25:11.974
"Madam, you were the victim of
an eight billion-to-one chance...

25:12.074 --> 25:16.782
a leaping anteater, an evolutionary
mutant previously unknown to science."

25:16.882 --> 25:19.186
- They climb like monkeys.
- Will you be quiet?

25:19.286 --> 25:21.689
Just get this fluffy toy
back in its enclosure...

25:21.789 --> 25:23.708
and stop insulting my intelligence!

25:25.545 --> 25:28.057
The tsetse fly, Muscidaeglossina.

25:28.157 --> 25:30.831
- Ten blood-sucking millimeters long.
- Are you all right?

25:30.931 --> 25:34.066
- One of the major disease carriers.
- I'm fine. I'll be okay.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.303
- Is she hurt?
- Little local difficulty.

25:36.403 --> 25:39.309
- She took a liberty with a bandicoot.
- A bandicoot?

25:39.409 --> 25:41.311
- My God!
- It's just a flesh wound.

25:41.411 --> 25:43.441
- A few stitches, I'll be back at work.
- Are you sure?

25:43.541 --> 25:46.315
Don't worry. It's part of the job
with the bandicoots.

25:46.415 --> 25:48.616
- Just be careful of those bandicoots.
- The bandicoots.

25:48.716 --> 25:51.385
- Bandicoots, right.
- Pity about Pip's leg.

25:51.485 --> 25:53.423
- But it's good for the zoo, isn't it?
- What?

25:53.523 --> 25:55.425
- All this fierceness.
- What's that?

25:55.525 --> 25:58.444
- Just a bite, sir.
- From what?

26:02.450 --> 26:04.998
- What's going on now?
- It's the sea lions, sir.

26:05.098 --> 26:08.021
Sea lions? What?
Are they attacking someone?

26:13.229 --> 26:15.147
Thank you! Everything's fine.

26:15.247 --> 26:17.166
Nothing to worry about.

26:22.639 --> 26:25.233
Nice crowds today, Director.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.408
Yes, yes, very good.

26:37.889 --> 26:40.172
And she's a fully trained
telephone engineer.

26:40.272 --> 26:41.674
- Really?
- Yes.

26:41.774 --> 26:43.771
I didn't know that.
Enjoying the show?

26:43.871 --> 26:46.679
- Stunning creatures, sea lions.
- Wonderful plumage.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.813
Lovely movers, too,
considering the flippers.

26:49.913 --> 26:51.267
God at His best, I'd say.

27:02.282 --> 27:04.998
- She couldn't do that if it were fierce.
- What?

27:05.098 --> 27:06.968
If it were fierce,
she couldn't go in there with them.

27:07.068 --> 27:10.670
I'm 100% behind the
Fierce Animals Policy.

27:10.770 --> 27:14.508
But in a case of animals like that,
the attendances speak for themselves.

27:14.608 --> 27:17.879
I understand the purpose of the policy
is to increase attendances.

27:17.979 --> 27:19.978
But where attendances are already high
for non-fierce animals...

27:20.078 --> 27:23.684
I would've thought there'd be
an exception to the general rule.

27:23.784 --> 27:27.264
Then there's the African
migratory locust...

27:28.410 --> 27:30.010
Perfect.

27:30.989 --> 27:31.989
Stay.

27:32.827 --> 27:34.731
It's typical, isn't it,
these management types?

27:34.831 --> 27:37.734
No inkling of interest in any
subject other than their own.

27:37.834 --> 27:40.737
- Bit more.
- Not too much. Gotta look real.

27:40.837 --> 27:44.140
Right. Better not do anyone else today
or he might get a bit suspicious.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.145
- Oh, yeah.
- We don't want to make him too fierce.

27:47.245 --> 27:50.844
I have a suggestion.
To make a complete idiot of him...

27:50.944 --> 27:54.562
let's make those wounds
as realistic as possible, shall we?

27:58.641 --> 28:00.040
Open the door!

28:10.754 --> 28:12.706
Something wrong
with the sights on this.

28:12.806 --> 28:15.573
I keep hitting coffee mugs. Right.

28:15.673 --> 28:19.596
I'll see you three in my office,
9:00 tomorrow morning.

28:24.201 --> 28:25.691
Oh, my God!

28:26.904 --> 28:30.120
Did you know that the anopheles
mosquito kills more people in a year...

28:30.220 --> 28:32.559
than all the wild animals
in Africa in a century?

28:32.659 --> 28:35.860
- Were you shooting more animals?
- No, just culling a few keepers.

28:35.960 --> 28:39.734
Leg better, is it?
Miracle recovery or...

28:39.834 --> 28:43.069
He's just shot a keeper!
Watch out!

28:43.169 --> 28:47.389
- No, I haven't!
- He is in there dying! Look out.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.444
Be quiet! Stop that or I'll...

28:50.544 --> 28:53.612
- Everything under control.
- Oh, my God, he's gone mad!

28:53.712 --> 28:55.225
Nothing to worry about.

28:58.472 --> 29:00.336
Here we are. Yeah.

29:02.310 --> 29:03.510
Right.

29:07.783 --> 29:10.234
Mr. Lee, I'm afraid
there's been an accident.

29:10.334 --> 29:14.102
Of course there has, Lotterby, and I
can promise you, it's the last one.

29:14.202 --> 29:16.106
- What?
- This lady fell, Mr. Lee...

29:16.206 --> 29:19.509
No, surely she's been savaged
by a chipmunk or gored by a gopher...

29:19.609 --> 29:22.011
or disembowelled by a chicken,
hasn't she?

29:22.111 --> 29:24.014
- Come on. Get off. I've had enough.
- What?

29:24.114 --> 29:26.248
- Put that stretcher down, you two.
- I fell.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.584
- She did. Scout's honour.
- I'm warning you, Lotterby.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.089
Put the stretcher down now!

29:31.189 --> 29:33.092
What are you doing?

29:33.192 --> 29:35.392
- Oh, come off it.Just get up.
- She needs treatment.

29:35.492 --> 29:37.396
- No, she doesn't.
- She's hurt her leg.

29:37.496 --> 29:38.797
- No, it's fake.
- What?

29:38.897 --> 29:41.042
It's fake blood.
Look. Taste it.

29:44.054 --> 29:45.804
- It's fake.
- Fake?

29:45.904 --> 29:48.381
Yes, fake. Try it yourself.

29:50.294 --> 29:52.943
- Who is this?
- He's the director of the zoo.

29:53.043 --> 29:55.578
- He's in charge.
- You've been rumbled, okay?

29:55.678 --> 29:58.680
- What?
- You're not fooling anyone, so get up.

29:58.780 --> 30:01.655
- What is going on?
- Don't you understand?

30:01.755 --> 30:04.754
This is artificial blood.
The whole thing's a charade.

30:04.854 --> 30:06.857
- She's not hurt.
- She is hurt.

30:06.957 --> 30:08.991
She's just one of the keeper's wives.

30:09.091 --> 30:11.094
- She's my wife!
- Look, taste the blood!

30:11.194 --> 30:12.831
She's my wife!

30:12.931 --> 30:15.216
- Taste the blood. She's your wife?
- She's my wife!

30:18.825 --> 30:21.816
- Wait a moment.
- He's drinking her blood! Stop!

30:23.696 --> 30:25.648
- Are you sure she's your wife?
- Of course!

30:25.748 --> 30:28.381
- Just get away from her!
- Let's be sensible about this.

30:28.481 --> 30:30.582
Count Dracula's telling me
to be sensible?

30:30.682 --> 30:32.886
- What is happening here?
- He's sucking her blood!

30:32.986 --> 30:34.553
- He's what?
- Look at his lips!

30:34.653 --> 30:37.189
- He's the director of the zoo.
- You're Rollo Lee?

30:37.289 --> 30:39.358
- Christopher Lee, more like.
- This woman is injured.

30:39.458 --> 30:41.595
- She needs attention.
- I know she needs treatment.

30:41.695 --> 30:44.696
- You just told everyone she didn't.
- Before you bit her.

30:44.796 --> 30:47.535
- Are you in pain, Mrs....
- Pike. No, but it's tender.

30:47.635 --> 30:49.540
- I can handle this.
- No, you can't.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.907
- I'm in charge. Yes, I am!
- No, you're not.

30:52.007 --> 30:56.260
By God, you Americans are pushy!
Who the hell do you think you are?

31:00.669 --> 31:02.587
Welcome to Marwood Zoo.

31:02.687 --> 31:04.752
Can I offer you a coffee, doughnut?

31:04.852 --> 31:07.366
- Cappuccino.
- That's him!

31:08.444 --> 31:10.694
- There he is.
- You're under arrest. Come here.

31:10.794 --> 31:13.394
- He shot a keeper.
- No, he didn't.

31:13.494 --> 31:15.434
He tried to, but he missed.

31:15.534 --> 31:17.987
Missed? Look at that.

31:24.127 --> 31:27.097
- Get off her, you pervert!
- Rape!

31:31.035 --> 31:33.162
So the big question is...

31:35.239 --> 31:37.174
what am I gonna do with you all?

31:38.109 --> 31:41.271
'Cause I'm almost certainly
on the scrap heap, you see.

31:42.548 --> 31:44.348
Ah, well.

31:45.885 --> 31:48.911
A pity. I like it here.

31:50.990 --> 31:54.240
Look what you've done!
That's the second time.

31:54.340 --> 31:57.023
Don't they teach you
any manners in Argentina?

31:58.364 --> 32:00.696
If you do that again,
I will shoot you.

32:02.535 --> 32:05.151
Coming! Come on.

32:05.251 --> 32:06.954
Get in there. Quick. Quick.

32:07.054 --> 32:09.925
- I still say we should just fire him.
- Okay, fine.

32:10.025 --> 32:12.535
- You call your father.
- Come here, darling.

32:14.180 --> 32:16.566
Now, quiet, you two.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.968
All right. Suzie?
Suzie, come here.

32:19.068 --> 32:20.970
He's at it again.

32:21.070 --> 32:22.871
Come on. Get in there.

32:22.971 --> 32:25.892
No fighting. Stop it.
Cut it out.

32:30.332 --> 32:32.323
Oh, hello.

32:34.303 --> 32:35.861
Can we come in?

32:37.273 --> 32:40.658
You are still working, right?
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.

32:40.758 --> 32:43.094
- Oh, do you want the report?
- Yes.

32:43.194 --> 32:47.081
- So, we can come in. Okay? Yeah?
- Good idea. Good idea.

32:49.786 --> 32:52.254
Bit of a mess, I'm afraid.
I just spilled something.

32:54.424 --> 32:56.808
Look, Rollo, we've been
reviewing your situation...

32:56.908 --> 32:58.811
and we've decided...

32:58.911 --> 33:02.715
to reappraise your position.

33:02.815 --> 33:05.719
- Away from the public.
- You saw the local paper?

33:05.819 --> 33:10.386
Yeah, the "Vampire Gunman
Runs Amok" story?

33:10.486 --> 33:13.443
That? Yes.
Bloody newspapers. Ha!

33:14.979 --> 33:17.528
Report to me tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.
and we'll discuss the position.

33:17.628 --> 33:19.534
And your new office.

33:19.634 --> 33:21.902
One thing before you go.

33:22.002 --> 33:24.738
About those five animals
that I'm supposed to have shot...

33:24.838 --> 33:27.107
- Smart career move, bub.
- What?

33:27.207 --> 33:29.218
Killing them saved
your ass from extinction.

33:30.831 --> 33:33.924
- Oh, I see.
- No, they just put it in.

33:35.202 --> 33:37.619
Well, it wasn't an easy
decision, obviously.

33:37.719 --> 33:41.521
You know, you've gotta
be hard-nosed, because...

33:41.621 --> 33:44.621
toughness is the name of the game
if you want no-nonsense management.

33:44.721 --> 33:48.030
After all, toughness
is what it's all about these days.

33:48.130 --> 33:51.933
Toughness and hard-noseness. Well,
hard-nasality, as I mentioned before.

33:52.033 --> 33:55.033
That is the bottom line,
as Rod often says.

33:55.133 --> 33:58.087
Rod is right. Remarkable man.
Absolutely remarkable man.

33:58.187 --> 33:59.138
Rod is right. Remarkable man.
Absolutely remarkable man.

33:59.238 --> 34:02.075
Six billion dollars!
How extraordinary!

34:09.284 --> 34:11.364
Damn radiator.

34:11.465 --> 34:14.855
- Hardly slept last night.
- I bet.

34:17.827 --> 34:20.375
Listen, Rollo, I don't like you.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.849
You're weird and unattractive.
You'd better reposition your attitude...

34:23.949 --> 34:26.614
vis-a-vis certain
members of the female staff...

34:26.715 --> 34:28.898
or you're gonna be out of here.

34:32.009 --> 34:34.101
"Certain members
of the female staff"?

34:35.612 --> 34:37.545
Oh, please.

34:39.815 --> 34:43.398
- Well, I think he's sexy.
- Sexy?

34:43.498 --> 34:46.203
He looks like a giraffe in drag.

34:46.303 --> 34:51.145
Did you get a whiff of his cologne?
Eau de Monkey Fart. He's a geek.

34:51.245 --> 34:53.344
The way he moves, it's like he's
borrowed his body for the weekend...

34:53.444 --> 34:55.350
and hasn't figured out
how it works yet.

34:55.449 --> 34:59.116
He's got something. He's been demoted,
and the girls are still all over him.

34:59.216 --> 35:03.423
I bet they're real dogs. Mangy,
nearsighted, weight-watcher rejects.

35:03.523 --> 35:05.726
God, he's so male.

35:05.826 --> 35:07.959
- Him?
- No, Jambo.

35:08.059 --> 35:10.311
Look. Isn't he wonderful?

35:11.050 --> 35:13.484
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Reminds me of my father.

35:14.420 --> 35:16.373
Was your father ugly?

35:16.473 --> 35:18.375
No, it's just I didn't
get to see him very much.

35:18.475 --> 35:21.241
But when I did, he used to
take me to the Atlanta Zoo...

35:21.341 --> 35:24.443
to see Willy B., the gorilla there.

35:24.543 --> 35:27.679
That's when I felt close to him.

35:27.779 --> 35:29.700
To the gorilla?

35:31.137 --> 35:33.072
No, to my father.

35:35.810 --> 35:38.262
Life just seemed simple then.

35:38.362 --> 35:39.938
Yeah. Yeah.

35:40.981 --> 35:42.961
Is this all he does?

35:43.061 --> 35:47.269
I mean, because the zoo is after
the entertainment dollar, right?

35:47.369 --> 35:49.706
Is that the show? Because if
this is the evening performance...

35:49.806 --> 35:51.709
I'm glad I missed the matinee.

35:51.809 --> 35:54.228
What do you do for an encore?
Fall asleep?

35:55.865 --> 35:57.844
You really don't
like animals, do you?

35:57.944 --> 36:01.219
It's not that I don't like them.
I just don't see the point.

36:01.319 --> 36:05.590
I remember when I was five,
my mother got me this dog.

36:05.690 --> 36:08.188
I just didn't get it.

36:08.288 --> 36:11.495
I suppose I had nothing
I needed fetched. So I sold him.

36:11.595 --> 36:15.298
- Oh, that's sad.
- Oh, he got over it.

36:15.398 --> 36:19.550
No, for you. It's very sad for you
because you couldn't love a puppy.

36:23.595 --> 36:27.827
This is the kind of conversation two
people have when one of them is female.

36:30.367 --> 36:32.167
Surprise!

36:36.075 --> 36:39.223
- Celebrate our partnership.
- Our partnership.

36:39.323 --> 36:40.993
That's right.

36:41.093 --> 36:43.761
However, there's just one thing
I couldn't help noticing.

36:43.861 --> 36:46.284
I don't know if you did.
We still have separate bedrooms.

36:49.155 --> 36:51.235
Just missed.

36:51.335 --> 36:54.541
I mean, we have
taken over the zoo.

36:54.641 --> 36:56.562
We are here in England.

36:59.228 --> 37:00.426
To us.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.479
I think it's too soon.

37:09.224 --> 37:10.224
Why?

37:12.345 --> 37:14.426
Because what we have is special.

37:14.526 --> 37:15.770
No, it isn't.

37:16.691 --> 37:17.925
Yes, it is.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.918
It's too soon.

37:28.462 --> 37:30.293
How too soon?

37:31.768 --> 37:34.382
Goddamn it! Thanks, asshole!

37:34.482 --> 37:36.404
This is your fault!

37:45.180 --> 37:46.180
You!

37:47.065 --> 37:49.986
Oh, hello. Lovely evening.

37:50.989 --> 37:52.906
What are you doing with that?

37:53.006 --> 37:54.908
- Oh, the lemur?
- Yeah.

37:55.008 --> 37:56.910
Oh, just putting it back
in its enclosure.

37:57.010 --> 37:58.928
Why'd you take it out?

38:00.097 --> 38:02.280
For a walk, you know, exercise.

38:02.380 --> 38:05.015
It can hardly move in there.

38:05.115 --> 38:07.251
The exercise is for me.

38:07.351 --> 38:09.453
So what do you need that for?

38:09.553 --> 38:11.458
That's a good point, actually.

38:11.558 --> 38:14.637
Well, perhaps I won't bother
in future. Thanks for the hint.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.315
Were you gonna use that
for target practice?

38:19.719 --> 38:23.119
Or one of your orgies?

38:29.761 --> 38:31.714
- Orgies?
- Yeah!

38:31.814 --> 38:33.580
I'm onto you.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.533
You were gonna put that somewhere.
You're sick!

38:38.273 --> 38:40.785
Is there a history
of insanity in your family...

38:40.885 --> 38:44.822
or is smashing up trolleys
the latest American craze?

38:44.922 --> 38:49.732
No, the latest American craze, pal,
is firing weirdos like you!

38:49.832 --> 38:54.468
Come on, Rollo, let's get you back home
before some loony attacks this trolley.

38:54.568 --> 38:56.906
"Come on, Rollo"?

38:57.006 --> 39:00.039
He's talking to himself,
and I'm the loony!

39:00.139 --> 39:02.879
Animals are boring!

39:02.979 --> 39:06.946
But people pay money to see them,
which led me to my latest inspiration.

39:07.046 --> 39:09.617
We are talking about a whole
new concept in sponsorship...

39:09.717 --> 39:12.819
that completely eliminates
the non-event impact deficit.

39:12.919 --> 39:15.292
For instance... What have we here?

39:15.392 --> 39:18.505
An African spurred tortoise.

39:20.916 --> 39:23.318
Who gives a shit, right?
I mean, look at it.

39:24.087 --> 39:26.201
If it died, would we know?

39:26.301 --> 39:31.592
My grandmother's grave is
a bigger attraction. But wait.

39:49.015 --> 39:52.197
It's not just some
nonentity tortoise now.

39:52.297 --> 39:55.202
It's Bruce Springsteen's tortoise.

39:55.302 --> 39:57.333
Immediately, it's an event!

39:57.433 --> 39:59.401
It's practically a celebrity itself.

39:59.501 --> 40:01.504
Will he come and visit it?

40:01.604 --> 40:04.061
- What?
- Will he come and visit it?

40:05.264 --> 40:08.446
- Yeah, when his schedule allows.
- So he's agreed to sponsor it?

40:08.546 --> 40:12.016
I'm expecting his call any minute.
But the potential!

40:12.116 --> 40:15.254
We can market little
Bruce Springsteen tortoises.

40:15.354 --> 40:19.392
Jurassic Park made half of its money
from those little plastic dinosaurs.

40:19.492 --> 40:23.075
And they're even deader than
this heap of garbage! Follow me!

40:23.884 --> 40:26.615
Now here we have a Brazilian tapir.

40:28.390 --> 40:30.368
I have to say I've dated
better-looking women.

40:30.468 --> 40:33.377
Now, listen to this
experience-enhancing...

40:33.477 --> 40:36.414
digitally-manipulated
educational tool.

40:36.514 --> 40:38.416
Brazilian tapirs.

40:38.516 --> 40:43.285
Solitary, three-toedungulates which
inhabit lowland forests in sunny Brazil.

40:43.385 --> 40:47.021
Reachable no win less than 14hours
via British Airways'...

40:47.121 --> 40:50.555
nonstop flights to stunning
Rio de Janeiro.

40:50.655 --> 40:53.463
I mean, it's bad enough
having to wear this rubbish!

40:53.563 --> 40:55.467
- I do know what you mean.
- I can only assume he's planning...

40:55.567 --> 40:57.665
to turn the entire zoo
into a supermarket...

40:57.765 --> 41:00.402
where he can sell videos
about animals in other zoos.

41:00.502 --> 41:02.571
- I agree.
- The cheap little souvenirs...

41:02.671 --> 41:05.708
the ones they didn't have time to see
because they were too busy shopping.

41:05.808 --> 41:08.113
I'm surprised he hasn't started
selling all the animals here.

41:08.213 --> 41:10.814
- Look, the point is this...
- Special summer sale.

41:10.914 --> 41:12.819
Antelope, 50% off.

41:12.919 --> 41:15.952
Ocelots, 200 pounds each
or six for a thousand.

41:16.052 --> 41:18.459
Rhino horn, just the job
for a Friday night.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.461
- Could I say something?
- One free porcupine...

41:20.561 --> 41:22.862
with every purchase
of two overpriced T-shirts.

41:22.962 --> 41:24.362
Please!

41:27.151 --> 41:29.699
- Thank you. I wanna make this point...
- If you ask me...

41:29.799 --> 41:31.937
I don't!
I can't get a word in edgewise...

41:32.037 --> 41:34.538
let alone ask you anything.

41:34.638 --> 41:36.560
- You didn't kill them!
- What?

41:37.563 --> 41:40.143
We checked! They're all alive!

41:40.243 --> 41:42.848
You rascal. He was only kidding.

41:42.948 --> 41:45.388
- Just figured that out, have you?
- I say.

41:45.488 --> 41:47.391
And now over here,
this used to be the lion house...

41:47.491 --> 41:49.393
but as it's no longer suitable
for animals...

41:49.493 --> 41:51.910
we're using it for middle management.

41:53.713 --> 41:57.363
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

41:57.463 --> 41:59.859
Can you keep a lid on it till
the sun goes down, for God's sake?

41:59.959 --> 42:00.691
Can you keep a lid on it till
the sun goes down, for God's sake?

42:00.791 --> 42:03.627
You're supposed to be working,
not prancing around your cell...

42:03.727 --> 42:06.343
like a flamingo with a boner!

42:07.986 --> 42:09.903
Terribly sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
We're having a little problem...

42:10.003 --> 42:11.967
getting the right balance
with his medication.

42:12.067 --> 42:16.017
This is a family zoo,
not the Playboy Mansion, you pervert!

42:17.028 --> 42:19.576
This is your last warning, Lee!

42:19.676 --> 42:22.313
Follow me, ladies and gentlemen. It's
perfectly all right. Sorry about that.

42:22.413 --> 42:25.049
Right this way. Right this way.

42:25.149 --> 42:27.539
Now I know why
they keep him in a cage.

42:35.314 --> 42:37.733
Yes, but we thought
you had actually killed them.

42:37.833 --> 42:40.534
- I had to pretend I shot them.
- Why?

42:40.634 --> 42:43.669
- To preserve my authority.
- What authority?

42:43.769 --> 42:45.675
Yeah, all right, all right.
Anyway...

42:45.775 --> 42:48.509
I'm just praying that Vince
doesn't fire me, 'cause I love it here.

42:48.609 --> 42:53.017
Oh, come on, you just love putting
things in cages, being an ex-cop.

42:53.117 --> 42:56.052
It's true, but this place
is still special.

42:56.152 --> 42:58.520
- It used to be.
- What?

42:58.620 --> 43:00.253
Before Vince McCain.

43:00.353 --> 43:03.260
He is right at the bottom
of the food chain, isn't he?

43:03.360 --> 43:06.872
I fail to see how
you can criticize him.

43:08.651 --> 43:09.651
What?

43:09.864 --> 43:11.770
He's bringing
the crowds in, isn't he?

43:11.870 --> 43:14.536
In order to raise the revenue
to the 20% profit margin...

43:14.636 --> 43:18.573
that you yourself were advocating
so vociferously less than a month ago...

43:18.673 --> 43:20.581
No, that's not what I was saying.

43:20.681 --> 43:22.312
- Yes, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

43:22.412 --> 43:24.148
- Yes, you were!
- No, I wasn't.

43:24.248 --> 43:26.152
What was the point
of raising it to 20%...

43:26.252 --> 43:29.452
All right, insect breath.
You really want to know what I think?

43:29.552 --> 43:31.923
- Yes.
- Right. I'll tell you.

43:32.023 --> 43:36.308
I think the whole
Octopus philosophy is poison.

43:37.647 --> 43:41.398
The only aim of any and every
McCain business...

43:41.498 --> 43:44.302
is to downsize
and halve the quality...

43:44.402 --> 43:47.774
to make enough money to acquire
another business to downsize...

43:47.874 --> 43:49.777
and halve the quality
to make enough money...

43:49.877 --> 43:52.408
to acquire another business to downsize,
et cetera, et cetera...

43:52.508 --> 43:55.830
without ever running
a single one of them really well.

43:56.077 --> 43:58.481
And if anyone ever
raises the question of quality...

43:58.581 --> 44:00.523
they're immediately attacked
as an elitist...

44:00.623 --> 44:03.323
because at Octopus it's considered
morally offensive...

44:03.423 --> 44:05.362
to talk about anything but money.

44:05.462 --> 44:10.062
All so that Mr. Rod McCain can feel
a little more powerful every day.

44:10.162 --> 44:13.068
That's why, instead of running...

44:13.168 --> 44:15.333
this wonderful zoo properly...

44:15.433 --> 44:17.339
we have to spoil it...

44:17.439 --> 44:20.393
in order to finance
his next mindless acquisition.

44:25.899 --> 44:28.446
On the other hand,
he is a remarkable man...

44:28.546 --> 44:31.550
- Tea time!
- Half past 8:00. We should be going.

44:31.650 --> 44:34.091
I haven't finished! I haven't finished!

44:34.191 --> 44:38.292
He is a true visionary of...
Hello.

44:38.392 --> 44:41.697
- I was just...
- Trashing Octopus. I know.

44:41.797 --> 44:44.567
It didn't really sound
like that, did it?

44:44.667 --> 44:46.589
Why do you work for us, Rollo?

44:49.660 --> 44:51.660
Cowardice?

44:52.929 --> 44:55.848
We all have to live in the real world,
or this place is gonna close...

44:55.948 --> 45:01.754
but I just want you all to know I intend
to run this one business really well.

45:01.854 --> 45:04.623
And if you do, we could open a chain
of them all over the world.

45:04.723 --> 45:07.689
Little zoos popping up everywhere,
all exactly the same.

45:07.789 --> 45:11.327
Leopards on the left, rhinos
on the right, monkeys in the middle...

45:11.427 --> 45:14.747
sea lions in the center,
ferrets in the front...

45:28.832 --> 45:30.767
I hate these banners.

45:35.342 --> 45:36.542
Hello.

45:51.524 --> 45:54.550
Oh, Vince, you idiot.

47:16.615 --> 47:18.583
Are you all right?

47:19.920 --> 47:21.854
Yeah, I'm fine.

47:36.002 --> 47:37.162
Come on, Jambo.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.233
Come on.

47:45.146 --> 47:47.410
Good boy. There you go.

47:52.653 --> 47:55.714
I have it. Yes, I do.
I do have it.

47:58.060 --> 47:59.924
You okay, Miss Weston?

48:05.634 --> 48:07.568
No, I'm fine, I...

48:10.140 --> 48:11.940
I just...

48:12.421 --> 48:14.899
Oh, you made contact.

48:16.981 --> 48:18.881
That's great.

48:24.554 --> 48:26.973
You don't understand.
I wasn't lying.

48:27.073 --> 48:30.641
Oh, really? Just what? Altering
my perception of the situation?

48:30.741 --> 48:32.646
I spoke with Springsteen direct!

48:32.746 --> 48:35.047
Direct? Oh, really?

48:35.147 --> 48:38.649
Yeah, he said, "Vince, you were born to
run with this. You have my blessing."

48:38.749 --> 48:41.784
Then how come I have this
pissed-off fax from his agent?

48:41.884 --> 48:45.489
Oh, this is just a negotiating ploy.

48:45.589 --> 48:49.058
Just offer him 50% of
the total tortoise revenue.

48:49.158 --> 48:51.532
There is no tortoise revenue.

48:51.632 --> 48:54.501
- Exactly. The point is...
- The point is, Vince...

48:54.601 --> 48:58.613
that this sponsorship stuff
is degrading to the animals.

49:00.193 --> 49:02.112
Like what?

49:02.212 --> 49:04.163
Like that.

49:06.165 --> 49:10.586
That's genius! There's not one
major award I won't win for that!

49:10.686 --> 49:13.752
That is unacceptable.

49:13.852 --> 49:17.058
- Take it off.
- But... But...

49:17.158 --> 49:19.442
It's brilliant.
It's never been done before!

49:21.115 --> 49:23.640
Try to work out why.

49:25.086 --> 49:27.004
- It's for the zoo.
- It's a perfectly reasonable...

49:27.104 --> 49:29.339
- request for information.
- She won't tell me!

49:29.439 --> 49:31.742
- She will!
- Not after what I said about Octopus.

49:31.842 --> 49:33.277
She likes you.

49:33.377 --> 49:35.876
She's the one who's always
on about consultations.

49:35.976 --> 49:37.882
- She likes you.
- What do you mean?

49:37.982 --> 49:39.884
What she means is, the pheromones...

49:39.984 --> 49:42.751
that you are unconsciously releasing
into the atmosphere...

49:42.851 --> 49:45.054
have the physiological
effect of increasing...

49:45.154 --> 49:47.288
the statistical probability of her
taking part...

49:47.388 --> 49:50.905
in some form of mounting behaviour, not
unlike that of an African grasshopper!

49:55.009 --> 49:57.067
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

49:58.212 --> 50:01.661
- What are you doing?
- Just visiting some little friends.

50:01.761 --> 50:05.135
Plenty of them at the zoo,
I've heard.

50:05.235 --> 50:08.803
- Yes. Look, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

50:08.903 --> 50:11.371
About some of these sponsorship ideas...

50:11.471 --> 50:14.176
I wonder if you and your fiance
don't feel that...

50:14.276 --> 50:15.676
Fiance?

50:16.378 --> 50:18.818
We're not together.

50:18.918 --> 50:20.718
Oh, good.

50:21.151 --> 50:22.333
"Good"?

50:27.009 --> 50:29.090
I know we're not making 20%yet...

50:29.190 --> 50:33.363
but some of the marketing
devices are a bit crude.

50:33.463 --> 50:36.147
- Yes.
- Good.

50:37.554 --> 50:39.269
Because, you know, the keepers...

50:39.369 --> 50:41.290
and I were...

50:42.893 --> 50:45.678
Oh, look at that.

50:45.778 --> 50:47.682
Aren't they gorgeous?

50:47.782 --> 50:50.701
Oh, they just make you
want to fondle them.

50:51.770 --> 50:54.121
Oh, yes! Yes!
I see what you mean.

50:54.221 --> 50:55.221
Yes.

50:58.444 --> 51:00.308
Is this one your favourite?

51:01.481 --> 51:03.399
Yes, I like him breast of...

51:03.499 --> 51:06.233
best of all the small mammaries.

51:06.333 --> 51:08.237
Mammals! Sorry.

51:08.337 --> 51:10.984
- Yes, his name's Rollo, actually.
- Really?

51:12.325 --> 51:16.286
Yes, so I sort of feed him
some special tits bits...

51:17.365 --> 51:20.094
Sorry. Tidbits.
I keep making boobs...

51:21.601 --> 51:24.298
Anyway, he just loves his nuts.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.640
Does he?

51:32.714 --> 51:34.514
And is...

51:34.995 --> 51:37.867
Rollo very sexually active?

51:37.967 --> 51:41.502
Well, he doesn't have a partner
at the moment, you know, if he had one.

51:41.602 --> 51:42.602
One?

51:43.608 --> 51:47.311
I mean, just one?
He wouldn't get bored or...

51:47.411 --> 51:51.649
I mean, you had two
in your cage the other day.

51:51.749 --> 51:53.549
Yes. Yes.

51:53.982 --> 51:58.919
Only some of the sponsorship gimmicks
are a bit sexessive...

51:59.019 --> 52:01.259
- Excessive.
- That's it. Sorry.

52:01.359 --> 52:03.859
Freudian slit... slut...

52:03.959 --> 52:04.959
Slip.

52:06.432 --> 52:08.350
Sorry. Slip.

52:10.488 --> 52:13.684
Rollo, do you really
want to talk about the zoo?

52:15.024 --> 52:16.960
Well, I think we ought.

52:20.131 --> 52:22.429
How about dinner, tomorrow night?

52:23.534 --> 52:24.934
Dinner?

52:25.349 --> 52:26.349
Yes.

52:27.917 --> 52:31.090
Well, yes, I don't think
I've got anything else on as yet.

52:31.190 --> 52:33.792
No, that'd be fine.

52:33.892 --> 52:35.814
Good. Dinner.

52:40.119 --> 52:41.719
Rollo...

52:42.436 --> 52:44.481
I think I like you.

52:47.061 --> 52:48.995
Something in the air.

52:52.332 --> 52:54.267
Fucking hell.

52:59.073 --> 53:00.673
Damn it!

53:01.355 --> 53:05.210
I can't have dinner with you tomorrow.
I'm having dinner with Rod McCain.

53:06.380 --> 53:07.526
What, here?

53:07.626 --> 53:10.933
No, at the Marwood Arms.
Wednesday, then.

53:11.033 --> 53:13.201
Yes, but...

53:13.301 --> 53:16.122
he's not gonna close us down, is he?

53:17.393 --> 53:21.043
The zoo's safe. Rod trusts me.
Don't worry.

53:21.143 --> 53:23.244
- Good.
- See you Wednesday.

53:23.344 --> 53:24.344
Good.

53:27.403 --> 53:29.517
I'd like to know what
McCain's really thinking.

53:29.617 --> 53:31.957
Just because she trusts him
doesn't mean we have to.

53:32.057 --> 53:34.325
I tell you, what you need to deal
with these big corporations...

53:34.425 --> 53:37.869
is inside information.

53:44.887 --> 53:47.807
- Where shall I put this?
- On the bed in our room.

53:47.907 --> 53:49.809
We didn't have to use
something this big, did we?

53:49.909 --> 53:52.812
The Revox A-77 is known as being
heavier than comparable models...

53:52.912 --> 53:56.148
owing to its three-motor design
and 1 0-1 /2 inch reel capacity.

53:56.248 --> 53:58.152
Would you like your bed
turned down now, Mr. Lee?

53:58.252 --> 54:00.899
No, everything's fine, thank you.
Good evening.

54:01.974 --> 54:03.892
- Acoustic response is required.
- Please, Bugsy.

54:03.992 --> 54:05.894
How much longer will it take
to get this mike...

54:05.994 --> 54:08.329
This FM transmitter will give
you wire-free remote sound...

54:08.429 --> 54:10.927
Shut up! Sorry.

54:11.027 --> 54:13.334
- I'm a bit on edge.
- We've got plenty of time.

54:13.434 --> 54:16.102
- We have not got plenty of time.
- McCain's not due for half an hour.

54:16.202 --> 54:18.106
Do you know the risk
we're taking here?

54:18.206 --> 54:20.671
If McCain finds us, we're dead meat.

54:20.771 --> 54:22.678
We'll be safely in there.

54:22.778 --> 54:24.944
You do realize this is a criminal act.

54:25.044 --> 54:26.449
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

54:26.549 --> 54:29.682
Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1957,
clause five, subsection three.

54:29.782 --> 54:32.953
- How soon? How soon?
- Just one microphone to check.

54:33.053 --> 54:35.305
- Right.Just one?
- Yeah.

54:37.445 --> 54:40.094
Another interesting thing about
the combination of the A-77...

54:40.194 --> 54:42.479
with a standard
hyper cardioid microphone...

54:43.951 --> 54:45.613
Dead wasp.

54:46.688 --> 54:48.451
Lucky you, Terry.

54:51.460 --> 54:52.674
- You all right?
- Yeah.

54:52.774 --> 54:54.678
- Any sign of anything?
- No, not yet.

54:54.778 --> 54:56.612
- Everything all right?
- Fine.

54:56.712 --> 54:59.082
- You can see the back entrance?
- Everything.

54:59.182 --> 55:01.034
Great. Keep your eyes peeled.

55:06.409 --> 55:08.240
Hey, over here!

55:10.313 --> 55:13.475
Right over here!
Here we go! Yep! Whoa!

55:14.217 --> 55:16.136
Let me get that, Dad.

55:16.236 --> 55:18.036
Oh, damn.

55:18.238 --> 55:20.639
Andas Professor Stephen Hawking
has pointed out...

55:20.739 --> 55:23.874
if you're watching a star collapse
to form a black hole...

55:23.974 --> 55:26.210
we must remember that
in the Theory of Relativity...

55:26.310 --> 55:28.776
- Hurry up!
- May I point out that...

55:28.876 --> 55:30.786
- Is the microphone fixed?
- Yeah, yeah.

55:30.886 --> 55:32.984
Let's get in the next room, please,
and close the door.

55:33.084 --> 55:36.891
- I'd just like to make a point...
- I don't care. I want you to be quiet.

55:36.991 --> 55:38.894
- Look, I know my loquacity...
- Will you can it?

55:38.994 --> 55:40.896
I mean, just for once?

55:40.996 --> 55:44.311
Are you aware what
a complete windbag you are?

55:52.275 --> 55:53.475
Rollo!

55:54.827 --> 55:56.027
Rollo!

55:57.714 --> 55:58.827
- They're here!
- What?

55:58.927 --> 56:00.127
Quick!

56:00.630 --> 56:02.430
The door!

56:06.758 --> 56:09.007
Other door!
Other door!

56:09.107 --> 56:11.376
It's our special, sir.
The Churchill Suite.

56:11.476 --> 56:14.943
I don't care what it's bloody called.
I just wanna know how much money it is.

56:15.043 --> 56:17.162
We've had many famous visitors
over the years.

56:19.806 --> 56:21.420
It's called the Churchill Suite
because...

56:21.520 --> 56:24.258
Sir Winston stayed here
on two separate occasions.

56:24.358 --> 56:27.093
We do hope you will enjoy your stay.
If there's anything at all...

56:27.193 --> 56:29.261
- It's Melbourne.
- All right. Gentlemen, ladies...

56:29.361 --> 56:33.033
if you'll excuse me,
I have a rather important call.

56:33.133 --> 56:36.168
A little bubbly? Have some champagne.
Come on. It's a big day.

56:36.268 --> 56:38.539
I'm so glad to see you.

56:38.639 --> 56:41.977
Yes, yes.
A grand day this is.

56:42.077 --> 56:44.209
All right, how much?

56:44.309 --> 56:45.709
Waiter.

56:48.969 --> 56:51.460
Right. Right.

56:54.642 --> 56:56.906
What'd be the cost of a plant
in Papua, New Guinea?

56:58.045 --> 56:59.876
I'm gonna close Melbourne down.

57:01.416 --> 57:04.201
- What?
- It's not being recorded.

57:04.301 --> 57:09.107
I know!
That's why I'm trying to listen!

57:09.207 --> 57:11.110
They shouldn't be so greedy.

57:11.210 --> 57:13.578
Right.
Fax Atlanta about this.

57:13.678 --> 57:15.412
Beijing called.

57:15.512 --> 57:19.481
We've got the television rights
to their public executions.

57:19.581 --> 57:20.649
Worldwide?

57:20.749 --> 57:23.229
- Five guys a week, guaranteed!
- Beauty!

57:24.842 --> 57:28.823
This is what satellite television was
invented for. Totally cross-cultural.

57:28.923 --> 57:31.927
So Vic... Vince...
what do want to talk about?

57:32.027 --> 57:35.144
- The zoo's going really well, Dad.
- Have you got the figures?

57:37.221 --> 57:39.701
It's taken some time to whip
the Brits into shape.

57:39.801 --> 57:42.338
Got some amazing plans.
You're going to be proud of me.

57:42.438 --> 57:43.859
Just give me the figures.

57:45.129 --> 57:47.446
You're not gonna believe
what I put together, Dad.

57:47.546 --> 57:49.022
Probably not.

57:51.337 --> 57:53.688
I really want to thank you, Dad,
for accommodating me, schedule-wise.

57:53.788 --> 57:57.524
It means a lot to me, both as
an employee and flesh- and blood-wise.

57:57.624 --> 58:00.444
Cut the crap.
It was on my way.

58:06.353 --> 58:08.378
Done really well, haven't I, Dad?

58:10.223 --> 58:12.507
Chip off the old block, eh?

58:12.607 --> 58:15.445
- I'm reading.
- Sorry.

58:15.545 --> 58:19.281
- Something here doesn't add up.
- If you read between the lines...

58:19.381 --> 58:21.082
What are you doing?

58:21.182 --> 58:23.102
The tarantula's escaped.

58:27.641 --> 58:29.788
What? What?

58:29.888 --> 58:32.472
- The tarantula's loose.
- What?

58:33.982 --> 58:35.962
Told you I'd kick ass, Dad.

58:36.062 --> 58:38.369
What I really wanted to ask is...

58:38.469 --> 58:41.305
I feel really close to you, Dad...

58:41.405 --> 58:43.369
these last few moments...

58:43.469 --> 58:45.378
and I was wondering,
could I get a raise?

58:45.478 --> 58:48.693
- Out of the question.
- Why?

58:49.733 --> 58:52.382
- I don't have the money.
- You got six billion dollars!

58:52.482 --> 58:55.388
Seven, but things
are tight right now.

58:55.488 --> 58:57.985
What the hell's making
all this bloody noise?

58:58.085 --> 58:59.371
Who's there?

59:01.011 --> 59:03.762
What about a small advance
on my inheritance?

59:03.862 --> 59:04.939
What inheritance?

59:07.884 --> 59:09.836
I'm your son.
You have to leave me something.

59:09.936 --> 59:10.936
Why?

59:11.499 --> 59:14.503
'Cause you screwed up
my whole childhood!

59:14.603 --> 59:17.287
How could I have?
Wasn't even there.

59:20.032 --> 59:22.192
Besides, I'm not leaving.

59:26.872 --> 59:30.224
- What do you mean?
- The moment I become seriously ill...

59:30.324 --> 59:33.729
I'm being cryogenically frozen
till they find a cure.

59:33.829 --> 59:36.631
All the money goes into a trust
till I get back.

59:36.731 --> 59:38.863
You mean you're not gonna die?

59:38.963 --> 59:40.544
Bad news, eh?

59:41.888 --> 59:43.287
Get ahold of yourself.

59:47.394 --> 59:49.442
That was a sheep.

59:49.542 --> 59:52.847
You mean, you're gonna be immortal?

59:52.947 --> 59:55.649
Now you got it!

59:55.749 --> 01:00:00.196
This cryogenic stuff isn't cheap.
It's costing me an arm and a leg.

01:00:06.749 --> 01:00:09.999
Sheep are exactly
like people, you know.

01:00:10.099 --> 01:00:14.403
Give 'em a couple of meals a day,
they just stand there quietly...

01:00:14.503 --> 01:00:16.423
till you eat 'em.

01:00:23.766 --> 01:00:26.082
- Christ!
- What?

01:00:26.182 --> 01:00:29.386
That's the biggest
goddamn spider I ever saw.

01:00:29.486 --> 01:00:31.857
Yeah. That's probably what was
making the bleating noise.

01:00:31.957 --> 01:00:35.957
- I don't like spiders. Kill it!
- It's terminated.

01:00:36.057 --> 01:00:37.057
Damn!

01:00:37.597 --> 01:00:39.397
I missed!

01:00:40.065 --> 01:00:43.233
It must've gone under the sofa.
I'll wait here.

01:00:43.333 --> 01:00:45.536
Listen, Vince, you might
have to close the zoo down.

01:00:45.636 --> 01:00:46.635
What?

01:00:46.735 --> 01:00:51.341
I can make a lot of money if I sell it
to the Japanese as a golf course.

01:00:51.441 --> 01:00:53.680
- But Dad, I'm...
- Shut up.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:57.394
And don't mention it to Willa yet.
Come on. Let's eat. I'm starving.

01:00:59.471 --> 01:01:01.017
- Hello, Mr. McCain.
- Hello, Willa.

01:01:01.117 --> 01:01:03.456
- Am I early?
- You're just in time. How's business?

01:01:03.556 --> 01:01:05.874
- So great. I have so much...
- Good, let's eat.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.997
- Do I look all right?
- Great, yeah. Never better.

01:01:11.097 --> 01:01:14.017
- How'd it go?
- Really well. Let's go.

01:01:16.689 --> 01:01:18.770
- Is that blood?
- Yeah, spider bite.

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:20.793
Come on. Let's go.

01:01:24.064 --> 01:01:26.111
Terry? Terry!

01:01:26.211 --> 01:01:29.646
There you are.
Terry-erries!

01:01:29.746 --> 01:01:32.399
- Got him!
- Her bag!

01:01:47.657 --> 01:01:49.283
Never again.

01:01:52.395 --> 01:01:53.985
Not at my age.

01:01:58.432 --> 01:01:59.632
Hello.

01:02:02.205 --> 01:02:03.405
Hello.

01:02:04.706 --> 01:02:06.389
What are you doing?

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:10.192
- Well, to cut a long story short...
- No, give me the long version.

01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:13.862
Oh, right.
Well, I took the room next door...

01:02:13.962 --> 01:02:17.134
just for the evening...
and just now I noticed that...

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:20.972
the interconnecting door wasn't locked,
so I strolled in out of curiosity.

01:02:21.072 --> 01:02:23.739
You took the room next door?

01:02:23.839 --> 01:02:25.745
- Yes, I wanted to...
- Just for the evening?

01:02:25.845 --> 01:02:27.763
listen to some music!

01:02:52.358 --> 01:02:54.505
Good news.
Customer pull-through...

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:56.943
way, way, way up!

01:02:57.043 --> 01:03:00.281
And the feedback
has been sensational.

01:03:00.381 --> 01:03:03.083
And I want to thank you
all personally for...

01:03:03.183 --> 01:03:08.355
the enthusiasm you've shown vis-a-vis
our latest, new, innovative initiative.

01:03:08.455 --> 01:03:10.759
You look fantastic!

01:03:10.859 --> 01:03:14.461
You're no longer a bunch
of smelly old animal keepers!

01:03:14.561 --> 01:03:16.697
No. As of today, you are official...

01:03:16.797 --> 01:03:20.482
theme-zoo visitation
enhancement facilitators.

01:03:21.356 --> 01:03:23.504
Now for the really big news.

01:03:23.604 --> 01:03:26.976
This is it, ladies and gentlemen,
the coup de zoo.

01:03:27.076 --> 01:03:29.996
If you'll just look this way.

01:03:40.876 --> 01:03:44.323
- Look! A panda! How did you get it?
- It wasn't easy.

01:03:44.423 --> 01:03:48.198
- It's beautiful. Look.
- Don't!

01:03:48.298 --> 01:03:50.866
- Don't! Stop!
- It's a dangerous animal!

01:03:50.966 --> 01:03:53.649
Stay away!
Back! Go on!

01:03:54.791 --> 01:03:56.692
Get out, get out,
get out, get out!

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:08.269
You diabolical bastard!

01:04:10.142 --> 01:04:12.701
You can't put an
animatronic animal in a zoo!

01:04:13.512 --> 01:04:15.993
- Why not?
- It's not real!

01:04:16.093 --> 01:04:18.534
So what?
It gave you a thrill.

01:04:18.634 --> 01:04:20.536
People come from
all over the world...

01:04:20.636 --> 01:04:23.571
who have never seen a panda
in their whole miserable life.

01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:26.669
It's not a real thrill, is it?
It's artificial!

01:04:26.769 --> 01:04:30.342
Having pandas in England
is artificial, for God's sake!

01:04:30.442 --> 01:04:33.679
What do you want me to do? Put everyone
on a plane and fly them to Africa?

01:04:33.779 --> 01:04:35.179
Africa?

01:04:35.649 --> 01:04:39.184
- They come from China.
- Not this baby.

01:04:39.284 --> 01:04:42.299
This was handmade in Belgium.
I don't want some cheap Chinese panda.

01:04:44.211 --> 01:04:47.529
What's the matter?
What is wrong with you people?

01:04:47.629 --> 01:04:51.297
I can't stand
all this negativity!

01:04:51.532 --> 01:04:52.624
- Why aren't you pleased?
- Go home!

01:04:55.468 --> 01:04:57.650
What does it take to get
appreciated around here?

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.157
This is a hit zoo, thanks to me!

01:05:00.257 --> 01:05:03.221
People come here to feel
their connection with nature.

01:05:03.321 --> 01:05:05.228
You don't get that
with electric pandas.

01:05:05.328 --> 01:05:07.230
We're just giving them
what they want!

01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:09.733
What about the quality
of the experience?

01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:11.701
No, Rod says quality
has never worked for him.

01:05:11.801 --> 01:05:13.601
Right! Everything he touches
gets tackier.

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:16.271
- That's the price of success.
- Vince!

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:20.306
I had an extraordinary
experience yesterday.

01:05:20.406 --> 01:05:22.329
What sort of experience?

01:05:23.466 --> 01:05:25.625
- With him.
- With him?

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.701
A sort of contact.

01:05:30.339 --> 01:05:31.339
What?

01:05:33.709 --> 01:05:37.095
- You couldn't understand, could you?
- Wait! Yes, yes, yes!

01:05:37.195 --> 01:05:39.863
Yes, yes, yes!
I think I do!

01:05:39.963 --> 01:05:43.442
I don't turn you on anymore because
you've got the hots for a gorilla!

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.703
It's not sexual.

01:05:46.803 --> 01:05:49.608
He's clearly more attractive
than I am, isn't he? Yes!

01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:52.443
But let me ask you something.
How much does he earn?

01:05:52.543 --> 01:05:56.146
How much does Mr. Gorilla
take home at the end of the week?

01:05:56.246 --> 01:05:59.681
Not a lot!
A couple of bananas!

01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:02.189
You know how much I'm worth?
Do you have any idea how much money...

01:06:02.289 --> 01:06:05.694
I have made since I've been
at this stinking zoo?

01:06:05.794 --> 01:06:09.861
1 .2 million dollars!

01:06:09.961 --> 01:06:14.032
- Yeah! Think about it!
- What are you talking about?

01:06:14.132 --> 01:06:18.568
I've made nearly 800,000
in sponsorship deals in cash...

01:06:18.668 --> 01:06:21.909
plus consultancy fees,
plus commission on animal futures.

01:06:22.009 --> 01:06:24.429
You've been stealing?

01:06:26.198 --> 01:06:29.949
No matter what I do or what I wear,
I can never impress you.

01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:33.219
- You're just like my father!
- This is going to close the zoo.

01:06:33.319 --> 01:06:34.919
So what?

01:06:36.557 --> 01:06:38.726
You and me, we walk away
with two million dollars.

01:06:38.826 --> 01:06:41.427
The place closes. What a shame.
The Japs buy it...

01:06:41.527 --> 01:06:44.495
Fore! "Hore" in one!

01:06:44.595 --> 01:06:46.836
You know what you are?

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.501
You're pronoid.

01:06:48.601 --> 01:06:50.204
"Pronoid?"

01:06:50.304 --> 01:06:52.804
It means that contrary to all
the available evidence...

01:06:52.904 --> 01:06:54.828
you actually think
that people like you.

01:06:55.831 --> 01:06:59.914
Your perception of life is that it's one
long benefit dinner in your honour...

01:07:00.014 --> 01:07:03.984
with everybody cheering you on
and wanting you to win everything.

01:07:04.084 --> 01:07:06.458
You think you're
the prince, Vince.

01:07:06.558 --> 01:07:10.091
Well, let me tell you something.
You will put back every last cent...

01:07:10.191 --> 01:07:12.630
into that zoo account
by 10:00 tomorrow morning...

01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:15.729
or I am gonna call your daddy...

01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:17.718
and tell on you.

01:07:31.703 --> 01:07:33.226
Hello.
Ready for dinner?

01:07:34.104 --> 01:07:36.129
Fine, let's leave it.

01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:41.724
Perhaps I should explain why I didn't
have any trousers on last night.

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:44.393
- It doesn't matter.
- No, right.

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:47.043
But you're wondering why the girls
didn't have any kit on either?

01:07:51.123 --> 01:07:53.638
Look, I'm sorry, I...

01:07:53.738 --> 01:07:56.355
I don't know what I've done
to upset you.

01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:59.826
It's not you, Rollo.

01:08:03.837 --> 01:08:06.018
I love this zoo.

01:08:06.118 --> 01:08:08.152
I love zoo too.

01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:10.037
The... The zoo too.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:20.201
It's all going wrong.
And now Vince has been stealing.

01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:23.037
- Stealing?
- Yeah, and if McCain finds out...

01:08:23.136 --> 01:08:25.339
I don't know what he's gonna do.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:30.510
Okay, look. Let's find out
how obvious it is to Atlanta, all right?

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:33.613
First we'll see if the bank
reconciliation figures...

01:08:33.712 --> 01:08:36.417
and the cash flow tie up.

01:08:36.518 --> 01:08:39.031
Then we'll...

01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:47.710
Thank you.

01:08:55.625 --> 01:08:57.372
You know about this stuff?

01:08:57.473 --> 01:08:59.377
I was in the police for 20 years.

01:08:59.477 --> 01:09:03.281
It's not just hitting people on the head
with dicks... Sticks! Sticks.

01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:04.581
Sorry.

01:09:06.303 --> 01:09:08.770
Damn.
You see, it is pretty obvious to...

01:09:13.243 --> 01:09:15.975
It is pretty obvious
if they know what they're...

01:09:22.754 --> 01:09:26.703
Willa!
I'm putting the money back...

01:09:26.803 --> 01:09:28.805
but only because
I have feelings fory...

01:09:28.906 --> 01:09:31.814
Oh, Rollo, not again!

01:09:31.913 --> 01:09:34.979
How do you do it? I'm gonna call
the zoo vet and get you fixed.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.002
Get the bimbo
out of Miss Weston's office.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:47.359
I can understand the gorilla,
but not Mr. Disgusting.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.029
- Vince!
- What is it? He drugged you?

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:53.131
Do you owe him money?
Was it a dare? What?

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:55.188
He's very attractive.

01:09:58.224 --> 01:09:59.954
Attractive?

01:10:01.396 --> 01:10:05.614
Attractive? How can you touch him?
Look at that suit!

01:10:05.714 --> 01:10:07.964
The suit comes off.

01:10:09.971 --> 01:10:13.020
I just got an image of that!
You must be desperate!

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.394
- Don't speak to her like that.
- "Don't speak to her like that!"

01:10:16.494 --> 01:10:19.926
Oh, engaged already, are we? You broke
up with that lemur pretty quick.

01:10:20.026 --> 01:10:23.666
Whose heart are you gonna break
next week? Some warthog's?

01:10:23.766 --> 01:10:25.603
- Where are you going?
- I'm out of here.

01:10:25.703 --> 01:10:27.735
- Leave me the money.
- I think not.

01:10:27.835 --> 01:10:30.743
- Vince, it's not yours!
- It is too!

01:10:30.843 --> 01:10:34.713
I stole it while you were two-timing me
with the Creature from the Black Lagoon.

01:10:34.813 --> 01:10:37.250
I wasn't even one-timing you.

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:39.286
- We never had a relationship.
- You were in love with me.

01:10:39.386 --> 01:10:41.985
- Oh, please!
- You just can't admit it, can you?

01:10:42.085 --> 01:10:44.562
You better hand that back
if you know what's best for you.

01:10:47.411 --> 01:10:49.571
What century are you from?

01:10:54.285 --> 01:10:55.810
Paisley!

01:10:57.488 --> 01:11:01.673
Are you insane?
I mean, what is the attraction?

01:11:01.773 --> 01:11:04.409
Well, for one thing,
he likes animals.

01:11:04.509 --> 01:11:07.381
- He doesn't just like 'em. He f...
- Miss Weston...

01:11:07.481 --> 01:11:09.384
finds them very attractive.

01:11:09.484 --> 01:11:12.049
Do you mind? We're trying
to have a board meeting here.

01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:16.221
We've been delegated by an emergency
meeting of the Keepers Committee.

01:11:16.321 --> 01:11:17.457
What emergency?

01:11:17.557 --> 01:11:20.862
Last night Rod McCain said
he might turn us into a golf course.

01:11:20.962 --> 01:11:22.865
- He did not!
- Yes, he did.

01:11:22.965 --> 01:11:25.098
- I was in the cupboard listening.
- The cupboard?

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:29.302
- He was too.
- It's true.

01:11:29.402 --> 01:11:32.574
- I want your cage cleared by 9:00!
- What did he say?

01:11:32.674 --> 01:11:34.578
- I'd like to make five points.
- In a moment.

01:11:34.678 --> 01:11:38.514
One: This zoo provides
a invaluable amenity.

01:11:38.614 --> 01:11:41.451
- If we didn't have the 20%...
- Any attempt to close it down...

01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:43.081
by the end of the month...

01:11:43.181 --> 01:11:45.989
- Bugsy, please!
- Shut up! I can't think!

01:11:46.089 --> 01:11:48.622
- Not to mention mass protests...
- Hey! Yo!

01:11:48.722 --> 01:11:51.736
Mouth-boy! Zip it!

01:11:52.781 --> 01:11:55.132
Not to mention
mass protests...

01:11:55.232 --> 01:11:57.697
My life is falling apart.
He will not shut up!

01:11:57.797 --> 01:12:00.312
- Financial markets of the world...
- Shut up!

01:12:02.593 --> 01:12:06.174
Second: In the conservation view,
there'd be considerable disruption...

01:12:06.274 --> 01:12:08.478
I don't believe it.

01:12:08.578 --> 01:12:11.213
I want to have a private word with
Vince while you're getting the police.

01:12:11.313 --> 01:12:13.685
Okay, Rod.
So you're gonna close the zoo?

01:12:13.785 --> 01:12:16.188
Too right. It's way under the 20%.

01:12:16.288 --> 01:12:18.123
You realize you're going
to have to shoot the animals.

01:12:18.223 --> 01:12:21.426
- So?
- Well, this is England, mate.

01:12:21.526 --> 01:12:25.996
We'll get some tame vet to say
they've caught some disgusting disease.

01:12:26.096 --> 01:12:27.901
- Pity this isn't Texas.
- Why?

01:12:28.001 --> 01:12:30.251
We could charge people
to do it for us.

01:12:49.575 --> 01:12:52.658
Fifthly: May I remind you
it takes at least 18 months...

01:12:52.758 --> 01:12:54.961
to decommission a zoological
facility of this kind.

01:12:55.061 --> 01:12:57.663
- Shut up or I'll shoot!
- My God! He's gone mad.

01:12:57.763 --> 01:13:00.102
What's this, the latest
Harvard Business School technique?

01:13:00.202 --> 01:13:02.801
Or merely an extension
of your policy of consultation?

01:13:02.901 --> 01:13:04.672
- You would rather talk than live?
- You won't shoot me.

01:13:04.772 --> 01:13:07.374
- I will!
- Not with a 7.65 Baretta .34.

01:13:07.474 --> 01:13:11.057
- Oh, really? Why not?
- The safety catch is still on.

01:13:12.066 --> 01:13:14.534
Grab him!
Get the gun, get the gun!

01:13:15.971 --> 01:13:19.020
What in bloody hell's
going on here?

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.991
Dad! You look great!
How ya doin'?

01:13:22.091 --> 01:13:24.068
Clear off, you freaks!

01:13:25.647 --> 01:13:27.614
- Who in bloody hell are you?
- This is Rollo Lee.

01:13:29.017 --> 01:13:32.201
Mr. McCain. I'd like to make
five points about the zoo.

01:13:32.301 --> 01:13:34.255
- Go away.
- Point one: The zoo...

01:13:37.326 --> 01:13:42.112
- You've been stealing from me again.
- Stealing?

01:13:42.212 --> 01:13:45.950
- My God, I've caught you red-handed.
- Oh, that!

01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:47.717
I was just putting that back.
I borrowed that...

01:13:47.817 --> 01:13:50.554
- Neville's gone to the police.
- What?

01:13:50.654 --> 01:13:55.894
- You're going to jail, Vince.
- Oh, no! Not again!

01:13:55.994 --> 01:13:58.995
Mr. McCain, Vince'll put the money back.
I promise.

01:13:59.095 --> 01:14:02.532
Sorry, Willa, but I'm gonna
have to close the zoo too.

01:14:02.632 --> 01:14:06.068
What? Why? We're up to 20%!

01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:09.442
- No, you're not.
- Oh, we are! We are with this!

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:11.743
- Are you sure?
- I swear it.

01:14:11.843 --> 01:14:13.127
Nearly 25.

01:14:15.334 --> 01:14:18.516
All right, I'll leave it open.
But don't let it drop.

01:14:18.616 --> 01:14:20.594
Say you won't have me arrested
or I'll kill you.

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:28.395
- You won't shoot me.
- Oh, yes, I will.

01:14:28.495 --> 01:14:31.434
You haven't got the guts
to shoot your own father.

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:34.646
Yes, I do! Get back!

01:14:36.255 --> 01:14:38.121
Go on then.

01:14:39.359 --> 01:14:41.941
Go on, you spineless twat!

01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:45.781
See?
You're no son of mine.

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:48.251
Oh, yeah, good idea!

01:14:48.351 --> 01:14:51.120
Give us all a good laugh,
you wuss!

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.420
I am not a wuss!

01:14:54.725 --> 01:14:56.492
Wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss!

01:14:56.592 --> 01:15:00.246
- Oh, God, I hate you.
- I hate you!

01:15:02.348 --> 01:15:05.840
- Gimme that gun.
- It's all right. It's a Baretta .34...

01:15:09.555 --> 01:15:11.284
You're fired.

01:15:24.904 --> 01:15:26.964
Is he dead?

01:15:31.147 --> 01:15:33.147
Oh, great.

01:15:34.065 --> 01:15:38.145
Terrific. He decides to keep
the zoo open, so you kill him.

01:15:39.422 --> 01:15:41.002
Brilliant. Well done.

01:15:41.102 --> 01:15:44.773
Thank you so much, especially for
shooting him right between the eyes...

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:47.443
so that it doesn't
look like an accident...

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.748
because the people at Octopus will know
he was coming here to close us down.

01:15:50.848 --> 01:15:53.848
So there's our motive
for murdering him. Stunning.

01:15:53.948 --> 01:15:57.255
Well, Mr. Brain of Britain,
what are we going to tell the police...

01:15:57.355 --> 01:15:59.956
who are, of course,
already on their way here?

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:04.194
Another example
of the thoroughness of your plan.

01:16:04.294 --> 01:16:05.942
Go on. I'm all ears.

01:16:08.118 --> 01:16:10.164
What do you suggest we do
with the dead body...

01:16:10.264 --> 01:16:12.233
of the incredibly famous man...

01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:15.383
who you have just assassinated?

01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:20.346
Sorry, I didn't quite catch it.
What?

01:16:20.446 --> 01:16:23.492
What was it?
Pop him in the blender?

01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:29.156
I know he's dead!
I did notice!

01:16:29.256 --> 01:16:31.004
Well... What?

01:16:41.855 --> 01:16:43.604
Give it, give it, give it...

01:16:43.704 --> 01:16:45.818
before you shoot somebody else!

01:16:50.965 --> 01:16:52.523
What are you doing?

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.481
- I'm freezing him.
- Why?

01:16:55.581 --> 01:16:58.488
He's gotta be cryogenically
frozen until they find a cure!

01:16:58.588 --> 01:17:00.553
- A cure?
- Yeah.

01:17:00.653 --> 01:17:03.493
- He has a bullet in the brain.
- Well, get more ice!

01:17:03.593 --> 01:17:07.498
Vince, there is no cure
for a bullet in the brain.

01:17:07.598 --> 01:17:10.746
It is very fatal.

01:17:15.525 --> 01:17:18.756
- You mean he's dead?
- Yes.

01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:24.564
- And he's not coming back?
- No. I'm sorry.

01:17:33.776 --> 01:17:37.461
I'm so happy!
You're dead!

01:17:37.561 --> 01:17:40.933
You're dead!
You're dead!

01:17:41.033 --> 01:17:44.967
You big, fat bastard!

01:17:45.067 --> 01:17:46.989
Yes, Bugsy!

01:17:48.525 --> 01:17:50.459
High five! Low five!
I love ya!

01:17:51.895 --> 01:17:53.920
Life begins!

01:17:57.268 --> 01:17:59.517
So what are we gonna do?

01:17:59.617 --> 01:18:01.585
I never have to listen
to you again, do I?

01:18:01.685 --> 01:18:05.059
With your, "You're no son of mine,
you miserable little worm.

01:18:05.159 --> 01:18:09.125
You've been a disappointment
to me since the day...

01:18:09.225 --> 01:18:11.965
your mother
farted you out of her womb."

01:18:12.065 --> 01:18:13.299
Good idea!

01:18:13.399 --> 01:18:15.771
I need something to glue
the mustache down with.

01:18:15.871 --> 01:18:18.119
I need things for the hair.

01:18:20.327 --> 01:18:22.779
- Neville, that's good, mate.
- That's terrible.

01:18:22.879 --> 01:18:25.111
Oh, no, those eyebrows are terrible.

01:18:25.211 --> 01:18:27.150
- Squint your eyes together.
- Like that?

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:29.314
- Right like that. Hold that.
- Careful!

01:18:29.414 --> 01:18:31.703
- Glasses!
- Oh, yeah, get the glasses.

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:36.337
- Give me cotton balls.
- Hello, Inspector.

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:39.571
Let's compare them.
Come on.

01:18:40.815 --> 01:18:42.997
Mr. McCain looks paler... much.

01:18:43.097 --> 01:18:45.035
- What do you think?
- He's dead, you idiot.

01:18:45.135 --> 01:18:49.541
- Oh, my God, it's not going to work.
- Oh, yes, it will.

01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:53.673
- No, no, no. We shall all go to jail.
- It's gonna go like clockwork.

01:18:53.773 --> 01:18:58.115
Hello, Neville.
Hello, Inspector.

01:18:58.215 --> 01:19:00.985
- That's very good!
- Do you have the will?

01:19:01.085 --> 01:19:04.119
- Very good indeed.
- It's very short.

01:19:04.219 --> 01:19:06.320
Yeah. The simpler it is,
the more watertight.

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.827
So we're going to set the zoo up
as a trust... that's for all of us...

01:19:08.927 --> 01:19:12.095
and everything else goes to
"my son Vincent McCain, absolutely."

01:19:12.195 --> 01:19:15.709
- You mean, we get the zoo?
- Yeah.

01:19:18.457 --> 01:19:20.841
Let's get this body
up to my office. Let's go!

01:19:20.941 --> 01:19:24.041
- I don't think this is fair.
- Fair?

01:19:24.141 --> 01:19:26.546
- You get to run the zoo with Willa.
- Yes.

01:19:26.646 --> 01:19:29.515
Well, I think I love her.

01:19:29.615 --> 01:19:32.092
- What?
- I love Willa.

01:19:34.239 --> 01:19:35.717
No, I love her.

01:19:35.817 --> 01:19:38.258
No, I love her.

01:19:38.358 --> 01:19:40.857
- I love her.
- I love Willa!

01:19:40.957 --> 01:19:45.042
Look, I get Willa,
you get seven billion dollars.

01:19:47.919 --> 01:19:51.184
- Right. Right, okay.
- There's the gun.

01:19:52.391 --> 01:19:53.571
Here we go.

01:19:53.671 --> 01:19:56.374
Come along, come along.
We haven't got much time.

01:19:56.474 --> 01:20:00.045
- I'm worried about fooling Neville.
- Neville's gonna be tough.

01:20:00.145 --> 01:20:02.519
- Oh, my God!
- Hello, Willa.

01:20:02.619 --> 01:20:05.555
Hello, Neville! Hello!

01:20:05.655 --> 01:20:10.893
Hello, Neville. Excuse me, I'm going
to go have a pee. I'll be right there.

01:20:10.993 --> 01:20:14.162
- Right, boss.
- Hi! Great to see you.

01:20:14.262 --> 01:20:16.397
Hello. Willa Weston.

01:20:16.497 --> 01:20:19.133
Chief Superintendent Masefield,
Sgt. Scott and Sgt. Irving.

01:20:19.233 --> 01:20:22.121
- Rod will be with you in a moment.
- I'll be a moment.

01:20:24.193 --> 01:20:28.545
Power!
Gets 'em every time.

01:20:28.645 --> 01:20:31.122
Oh, yeah. That's better.

01:20:35.603 --> 01:20:37.988
Thank you, my dear.

01:20:38.088 --> 01:20:41.323
Hello, Neville.
Hello, Inspector.

01:20:41.423 --> 01:20:44.560
I'd like to introduce you
to Inspector Masefield.

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.795
G'day. Good on ya.

01:20:46.895 --> 01:20:49.466
- Good outfit.
- It's an honour to meet you, Mr. McCain.

01:20:49.566 --> 01:20:52.905
Well, goody.
Hello, Neville.

01:20:53.005 --> 01:20:55.822
- Hello, Rod.
- Hello, Nev.

01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:02.080
- Have you spoken to Vince?
- Yes, I have.

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.018
- Shall we arrest him now, sir?
- No, that won't be necessary.

01:21:05.118 --> 01:21:08.285
Vince and I have had a long talk.

01:21:08.385 --> 01:21:11.759
Between ourselves,
it was quite emotional.

01:21:11.859 --> 01:21:14.025
You haven't killed him,
have you, Rod?

01:21:14.125 --> 01:21:16.047
Nobody's killed anybody!

01:21:18.684 --> 01:21:21.698
Moron! No, I mean...

01:21:21.798 --> 01:21:23.603
that we've had a reconciliation.

01:21:23.703 --> 01:21:26.338
- Isn't it wonderful?
- A reconciliation?

01:21:26.438 --> 01:21:28.937
That's right, Neville.
Back, Neville.

01:21:29.037 --> 01:21:33.914
- So you're not pressing charges?
- On the contrary, Inspector.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:36.082
Not at all.
But I would like your assistance.

01:21:36.182 --> 01:21:38.819
I've just made out a new will
and I'd like you to witness it.

01:21:38.919 --> 01:21:41.188
- A new will?
- Bend down, Neville.

01:21:41.288 --> 01:21:43.557
- It would be a privilege, Mr. McCain.
- Thank you.

01:21:43.657 --> 01:21:45.895
What do you mean, a new will?

01:21:45.995 --> 01:21:49.866
As a result of my talk with Vince,
I've decided to leave Octopus to him.

01:21:49.966 --> 01:21:52.402
- What?
- Hold still!

01:21:52.502 --> 01:21:55.738
- Leave Octopus to Vince?
- Shut up! He's a good boy.

01:21:55.838 --> 01:21:58.742
Good boy?
He's a total wanker, Rod!

01:21:58.842 --> 01:22:00.761
I won't have you
talk about him like that!

01:22:02.931 --> 01:22:05.315
Rod, he steals from you.

01:22:05.415 --> 01:22:08.583
That's only to get the attention I
should've given him when he was a child!

01:22:08.683 --> 01:22:11.555
But you can't leave Octopus
to that asshole!

01:22:11.655 --> 01:22:15.202
That asshole is my son!

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:19.092
I love him.

01:22:19.192 --> 01:22:22.162
But you're always saying
what a complete wuss he is.

01:22:22.262 --> 01:22:23.616
I am not...

01:22:24.655 --> 01:22:28.751
going to let you
talk about him in that way.

01:22:45.564 --> 01:22:47.780
- Are you all right, mate?
- I'm feeling emotional.

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.459
What's that?

01:22:50.803 --> 01:22:54.555
- It's where I keep my Kleenex.
- He's very depressed, Neville.

01:22:54.655 --> 01:22:57.459
Isn't it wonderful to see a man
get in touch with his feelings?

01:22:57.559 --> 01:22:59.793
- There's something going on here.
- Oh, I hope so.

01:22:59.893 --> 01:23:03.828
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I need to be alone.

01:23:03.928 --> 01:23:07.669
Feeling a bit suicidal.

01:23:07.769 --> 01:23:12.021
What?
This isn't like Rod!

01:23:13.394 --> 01:23:15.610
Hey! He's in the shed!

01:23:15.710 --> 01:23:18.529
- What?
- He's in the shed!

01:23:20.267 --> 01:23:22.348
Gentlemen, I admit it.

01:23:22.448 --> 01:23:25.985
I behaved disgracefully
to my son in the past.

01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:28.424
I don't know if I can
live with myself.

01:23:28.524 --> 01:23:31.863
So, going to the shed.

01:23:31.963 --> 01:23:34.928
Mother always said that when
you're naughty, you go to the shed.

01:23:35.028 --> 01:23:36.712
And I've been naughty.

01:23:38.654 --> 01:23:40.588
God, I'm depressed!

01:23:49.999 --> 01:23:51.296
Going to the shed.

01:23:55.306 --> 01:23:57.397
- It's going well. Where's the body?
- Over there.

01:23:58.808 --> 01:24:02.210
Come on, come on! Give it here.
Let's go! We gotta go!

01:24:04.415 --> 01:24:06.063
What is going on?

01:24:06.163 --> 01:24:09.501
- He and Vince did get very upset.
- It was so touching.

01:24:09.601 --> 01:24:13.737
Oh, God. I've undervalued
Vince's talent all these years.

01:24:13.837 --> 01:24:17.407
And his extraordinary charm.
Let's not forget that.

01:24:17.507 --> 01:24:20.746
What a dear boy he was,
my Vince, and still is.

01:24:20.846 --> 01:24:25.151
Good-looking young lad.
Christ, he's attractive.

01:24:25.251 --> 01:24:27.418
- Such style!
- Where is Vince?

01:24:27.518 --> 01:24:30.987
- That's a good question.
- Vince?

01:24:31.087 --> 01:24:34.861
I never went to one of my
birthday parties, the bastard!

01:24:34.961 --> 01:24:38.597
- His! His!
- His birthday parties, the bastard!

01:24:38.697 --> 01:24:43.303
I'm the bastard! I'm such a bastard
I can't stand it anymore!

01:24:43.403 --> 01:24:47.311
I can't face it! Oh, the shame!
I feel terrible!

01:24:47.411 --> 01:24:51.011
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
but I've got a pretty shrewd idea...

01:24:51.111 --> 01:24:53.347
it's not gonna be very nice!

01:24:53.447 --> 01:24:56.218
- I'm taking the wuss's way out!
- Is he all right?

01:24:56.318 --> 01:24:58.919
He's probably in one
of his black moods.

01:24:59.019 --> 01:25:00.789
What black moods?

01:25:00.889 --> 01:25:06.230
End of the road! I can't take it
any longer! I'm going to finish it now!

01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:07.730
My God!

01:25:09.064 --> 01:25:11.468
- Has he got a gun?
- Gun? What gun?

01:25:11.568 --> 01:25:13.701
Where's the gun?
The gun!

01:25:13.801 --> 01:25:14.801
What?

01:25:16.458 --> 01:25:20.075
I'm at the end of the road!
I'm very near the end.

01:25:20.175 --> 01:25:22.676
I'm gonna...
I can see the end of the road.

01:25:22.776 --> 01:25:25.881
I'm makin' up my mind.
It's not an easy...

01:25:25.981 --> 01:25:28.651
He's forgiven you.
Be sensible!

01:25:28.751 --> 01:25:31.922
At least it looks like
the end of the road.

01:25:32.022 --> 01:25:34.171
Now I'm thinkin' about it.

01:25:37.815 --> 01:25:39.282
I'll make my mind up
any moment now.

01:25:50.027 --> 01:25:54.123
I love you, kid.
Forgive me.

01:26:17.858 --> 01:26:19.972
Hurry! Hurry!

01:26:20.072 --> 01:26:22.757
One! Two! Come on!

01:26:26.567 --> 01:26:29.648
- Oh, no!
- Don't look!

01:26:29.748 --> 01:26:32.657
- Why were your men so slow?
- Sorry, we didn't realize...

01:26:32.757 --> 01:26:34.754
- This isn't Rod McCain.
- What?

01:26:34.854 --> 01:26:39.425
I spent 15 years working at Octopus,
and this isn't Rod McCa...

01:26:39.525 --> 01:26:41.431
I was in the garden
when I heard a gunshot...

01:26:41.531 --> 01:26:44.232
- Father!
- I'm afraid he's dead.

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:45.581
- No!
- Yes.

01:26:47.956 --> 01:26:50.571
- What are you doing?
- He shot himself.

01:26:50.671 --> 01:26:52.271
No! Why?

01:26:52.710 --> 01:26:55.242
He wasn't in one of his
black moods, was he?

01:26:55.342 --> 01:26:58.080
He just couldn't live
with what he'd done to you.

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.215
- But I'd forgiven him.
- I know.

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:03.915
Oh, Dad! Dad! Dad!

01:27:05.175 --> 01:27:06.457
- Vince.
- What?

01:27:06.557 --> 01:27:08.461
- There's something you should know.
- What?

01:27:08.561 --> 01:27:11.207
He left Octopus to you.

01:27:13.383 --> 01:27:16.410
So he did love me after all!

01:27:25.797 --> 01:27:27.889
You're fired.

01:27:57.330 --> 01:28:00.216
Rollo, there's something
I need to ask you.

01:28:00.316 --> 01:28:02.551
It's about sex.

01:28:02.651 --> 01:28:03.651
What?

01:28:04.385 --> 01:28:07.189
Look, I know what you like.

01:28:07.289 --> 01:28:10.694
When we first called,
you had three women in your bed.

01:28:10.794 --> 01:28:16.032
- What?
- Remember Mitzi and Suzie and Cindy?

01:28:16.132 --> 01:28:19.733
And then
when we came to your room...

01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:22.517
you had at least four girls
in the bathroom.

01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:27.810
They were all over you
in the cage.

01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:30.411
And then the other night in the hotel,
you had two girls...

01:28:30.511 --> 01:28:33.697
as well as the...

01:28:37.548 --> 01:28:38.953
Look, Willa...

01:28:39.053 --> 01:28:42.663
Look, Rollo,
I really like you.

01:28:43.313 --> 01:28:46.806
But I was just wondering
if one woman...

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:49.698
could ever be enough...

01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:52.520
for a man like you.

01:28:56.165 --> 01:28:59.051
Oh, what the hell.
Let's give it a try.

01:29:08.707 --> 01:29:11.628
- But I have to warn you, Wanda...
- Willa.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.409
I haven't slept with one woman
for a very, very long time.
