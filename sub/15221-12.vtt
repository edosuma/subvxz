not use that word again, you-

I talked to the guys.
I told them you're confused,

that you felt sorry for Phillip
because he was your roommate.

Is this true?
Yes, sir. Yes, Admiral.

Last night, outside my quarters.
That's a lie. I wasn't anywhere
near your quarters last night.

21:53.912 --> 21:58.042
I think the Lieutenant Commander
should be reminded
of the honor code, sir.

21:58.116 --> 22:01.415
Commander York should be reminded
that the navy's not a breeding ground
for sexual deviants.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.080

Phillip, Ronnie's going to kill you.

28:27.338 --> 28:30.466
- Chambers?
- Yeah.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.875
- He's the head of the Chain, right?
- Right.

28:33.945 --> 28:36.914
Which is all the more reason
for you to listen to me.

28:36.981 --> 28:40.348
All I'm suggesting is that you just
get out of here for a couple of days.

28:40.418 --> 28:43.751
No way. Hey, look, Tommy,
I'm over 21 years old.
<i>Phillip-</i>

28:43.822 --> 28:46.052
I'm a big boy now.
I don't know about you,

28:46.124 --> 28:48.388
but I don't need anybody
telling me what to do.

28:49.794 --> 28:52.160
I'm tired of running.
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.658
<i>[ Bell Tolling ]</i>

28:57.736 --> 29:00.296
<i>[ Al ] Did you tell him</i>
<i>that he was in danger?</i>
<i>[ Sam ] Yes.</i>

29:00.371 --> 29:02.305
I don't even think he heard me.

29:02.373 --> 29:05.001
Then I told him that Ronnie
was the head of the Chain, right?

29:05.076 --> 29:08.239
And he seemed even more set
on publishing the list.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.781
Well, according to Ziggy,
it doesn't change a thing.

29:10.849 --> 29:13.317
Meaning what?
Meaning he still dies.

29:15.053 --> 29:19.319
Where you goin'?
If I can't stop Phillip,
I can stop Ronnie.

29:19.390 --> 29:22.450
Sir!

29:22.527 --> 29:25.155
Now what?

29:25.230 --> 29:27.664
<i>[ Knocking ]</i>
Enter.

29:27.732 --> 29:29.723
Dismissed, Chambers.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.476
<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>

29:39.544 --> 29:41.535
[ Sighs ]
Sit down, York.

29:49.354 --> 29:54.621
<i>You do understand</i>
<i>why the military looks down</i>
<i>on homosexuals.</i>

29:54.692 --> 29:57.855
No, sir, I don't.

29:57.929 --> 30:01.387
Homosexuals are a security risk.

30:01.466 --> 30:05.232
They're easily blackmailed,
and they lack leadership qualities.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.294
If you'll excuse my saying so, sir,

30:07.372 --> 30:11.035
I don't believe that a person's
sexual preference has anything to do
with their ability to lead,

30:11.109 --> 30:13.373
or anything else for that matter.

30:13.444 --> 30:17.813
I'm sure from where you stand,
that's true. But I disagree with you,
and so does the navy.

30:17.882 --> 30:19.816
So do I.

30:19.884 --> 30:23.320
When a man is shipped off to war,
he wants to know who's beside him.

30:23.388 --> 30:26.448
He wants to know there's someone
there he can depend on.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.719
Exactly.

30:28.793 --> 30:34.425
Phillip Ashcroft was a straight-A student,
a leader, a cadet commander.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.730
And no one,
including yourself, sir,

30:37.802 --> 30:41.294
<i>doubted his leadership</i>
<i>until they found out he was different.</i>

30:41.372 --> 30:44.432
This is not about Mr. Ashcroft!

30:47.278 --> 30:50.907
<i>Now you've shown outstanding</i>
<i>leadership in your time</i>
<i>here at Prescott.</i>

30:50.982 --> 30:55.112
<i>But in light of recent facts,</i>
<i>I'm afraid I'm forced to</i>
<i>confine you to quarters...</i>

30:55.186 --> 30:57.245
<i>until we convene</i>
<i>a board of inquiry.</i>

30:57.322 --> 31:00.553
<i>Oh, Sam,you can't let him do</i>
<i>that, because ifhe locks you in,</i>

31:00.625 --> 31:02.786
you won't, be able to stop Ronnie
from killing Phillip.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.627
Sir, this letter does nothing more than
prove my desire to stop an injustice.

31:07.632 --> 31:10.430
Nevertheless,
it's sufficient to cast doubts.

31:12.604 --> 31:17.564
I promise you'll get a fair hearing
when the time comes. Dismissed.

31:17.642 --> 31:19.735
- Sir, please-
- Dismissed.

31:28.853 --> 31:31.617
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Well, I don't know</i>
<i>why you're mad at me.</i>

31:33.591 --> 31:36.719
I didn't lock you in here.
No, but you agreed with him.

31:36.794 --> 31:39.524
Well, never mind that.
You got to figure out a way
to get out of here.

31:39.597 --> 31:41.622
No kidding.

31:41.699 --> 31:45.135
Now, I got two cadets outside
the door; I got a three-story drop
outside the window.

31:45.203 --> 31:47.899
I'm open for suggestions.

31:47.972 --> 31:49.997
Mind if I come in?

31:51.009 --> 31:55.673
What are you doin' here, Coach?
I, uh, heard about
what happened.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.238
Thought I'd come by
to see how you're doin'.

31:58.316 --> 32:01.251
I'm okay.
You sure you want to be seen with me?

32:01.319 --> 32:04.311
I'm not exactly the most
popular guy in college.

32:04.389 --> 32:07.119
I'll take my chances.
Sit down, Tommy.

32:10.028 --> 32:12.553
Why didn't you come
and talk to me?

32:14.699 --> 32:20.035
- Well, I, uh- I thought this was
somethin' I could handle by myself.
- Hey, he can help you get out of here.

32:20.104 --> 32:23.596
Is there anything I can do?

32:23.675 --> 32:27.008
Coach, I really need
to get out of here.

32:27.078 --> 32:30.707
Now, now, this isn't going to
make a whole lot of sense,

32:30.782 --> 32:32.773
but bear with me on this.

32:32.850 --> 32:36.286
I have reason to believe that Ronnie
and a couple of his buddies...

32:36.354 --> 32:38.652
are going to kill
someone tonight.
What?

32:38.723 --> 32:42.159
Ronnie is the leader of this group
called the Chain.

32:42.226 --> 32:44.387
Now they've been going around
attacking gays.

32:44.462 --> 32:48.023
They're gonna do it again tonight.
Only this time, they're gonna kill him.

32:48.099 --> 32:50.067
Who?
Phillip Ashcroft.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.965
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Ronnie and the others are</i>
<i>in the locker room right now.</i>

32:52.036 --> 32:54.334
Ronnie and the others are
in the locker room right now.

32:55.740 --> 32:59.232
I want this little fairy wiped out.
[ All ]
Yeah! Let's get him!

32:59.310 --> 33:02.677
Does everybody know
what they're going to do?
Let's do it, Ronnie.

33:02.747 --> 33:06.274
[ Chattering ]
Is this a private club, people,

33:06.351 --> 33:10.811
or can any idiot join?
I like that one.

33:10.888 --> 33:13.152
Coach. Uh, what-what
are you doin' here?

33:15.026 --> 33:18.928
We're here to stop you.
Stop us? From what?

33:18.997 --> 33:23.559
From whatever it is that
makes you feel like you have to
wear masks to hide behind.

33:23.634 --> 33:26.125
Coach, will you
excuse us a minute?

33:27.438 --> 33:29.702
I'll be outside.

33:31.776 --> 33:34.244
Sit down, guys.

33:34.312 --> 33:37.372
So, what, you had a little late practice
meeting or something?

33:37.448 --> 33:40.747
We had some business to discuss.
Business, huh?

33:40.818 --> 33:44.720
Ha. Well, you must be
real proud of your work.

33:44.789 --> 33:46.780
Coach is right.
You guys are pathetic.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.658
Hey, don't come in here
and pass judgment.

33:50.728 --> 33:52.696
At least we're not defending
some little fairy.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.460
What is it that
you are so afraid of?

33:55.533 --> 33:59.264
I'm not afraid of anything.
Really? It sure seems
like it to me.

33:59.337 --> 34:02.067
In fact, if I didn't know better,
I'd think you were hidin' something.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.904
What the hell are you talkin' about?

34:04.976 --> 34:07.376
- Nothin'.
- <i>You could be onto something there.</i>

34:07.445 --> 34:12.882
Maybe.
It just seems to me that you're
taking a lot of this very personally.

34:12.949 --> 34:17.545
You know,
like it was your problem.
I'm not a fag.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.612
Says who?

34:19.690 --> 34:22.591
I haven't seen you
with any girls lately.

34:22.659 --> 34:25.891
You always seem to be
hangin' around the locker room.

34:25.963 --> 34:28.523
I don't know, maybe it's just me.
It just seems kind of weird,
that's all.

34:28.599 --> 34:30.760
You son of a bitch-

34:33.571 --> 34:37.302
All right, now everybody
take a good look at yourselves
in the mirror, all right?

34:37.375 --> 34:39.467
<i>A good look.</i>

34:39.543 --> 34:43.411
Because if you do, I don't think
you're gonna like what you see.

34:44.649 --> 34:48.813
Hey, maybe he's right, Ronnie.

34:48.886 --> 34:52.754
I mean, maybe this thing's gone too far.

34:55.426 --> 34:58.293
Well, what about the rest
of you chickens, huh?

34:58.362 --> 35:01.092
You gonna let some queer tell you
what you're gonna do?

35:01.165 --> 35:04.259
It's over, man.
Let it go.

35:04.335 --> 35:07.498

<i>Well, when does Ziggy</i>

he dies sometime
in the next couple of hours.

40:52.116 --> 40:55.552
Phillip, they didn't believe you.

40:55.619 --> 41:00.249
Don't you see?
If you kill yourself,
Ronnie wins.

41:00.324 --> 41:05.193
<i>Look, I know you're hurting.</i>
<i>You said you wanted to make</i>
<i>a statement. So make one.</i>

41:06.597 --> 41:08.792
Show the whole world
you're not ashamed.

41:08.866 --> 41:11.130
I can't do this alone.
<i>[ Thunder ]</i>

41:11.202 --> 41:15.036
<i>Ashcroft.!</i>
<i>What the hell's goin'on?</i>

41:17.041 --> 41:19.669
- Get down from that ladder.
- I can't, Coach.

41:19.743 --> 41:23.907
- Yes, you can.
- Don't you come any closer!

41:23.981 --> 41:27.144
Coach, maybe you ought to
just back off a little bit.

41:27.218 --> 41:30.710
- You're a coward, Ashcroft.
- No, I'm not.

41:36.527 --> 41:41.021
- No, I, uh- I guess maybe I am.
- What?

41:41.098 --> 41:43.362
You're not alone, Phillip.

41:44.902 --> 41:49.305
I know about the guilt,
the shame, the fear.

41:49.373 --> 41:52.035
I've spent my whole life that way.

41:52.109 --> 41:54.339
Wonderin' why
I had to be different.

41:56.614 --> 41:59.082
Hoping that it'd just pass.

42:00.084 --> 42:02.052
Well, it's okay to be different.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.385
<i>And the only ones we have to</i>
<i>be afraid of are ourselves.</i>

42:07.458 --> 42:10.894
You and Tommy
made me realize that.

42:10.961 --> 42:15.728
You and I?
Hey, we got nothing
to be ashamed of.

42:17.034 --> 42:20.936
<i>Now, come on down.</i>

42:21.005 --> 42:23.735
We'll save the cops
a lot of paperwork.

42:40.157 --> 42:43.558
Hey.
[ Sobbing ]

42:43.627 --> 42:46.357
Are you okay?
Yeah.

42:53.103 --> 42:55.162
Yeah, I'm okay.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.804
Okay. Let's go.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.807
Oh, that was close, Sam.

43:04.882 --> 43:09.410
He was really gonna do it.
<i>Yeah.</i>

43:09.486 --> 43:12.922
But he doesn't try to
commit suicide again.

43:12.990 --> 43:15.185
[ Sighs ]

43:15.259 --> 43:19.958
So- So I guess
I can leap now, huh?

43:21.031 --> 43:24.467
Uh, uh, no. Not yet.

43:24.535 --> 43:26.833
Why not?

43:26.904 --> 43:28.963
I can't believe this.

43:29.039 --> 43:33.601
I mean, it's not enough
that I save somebody's life, right?
I got to win the damn race too?

43:33.677 --> 43:38.307
Well, it's not just any old race, Sam.
This gives Prescott a chance
to beat Hillview.

43:38.382 --> 43:41.215
They haven't beat 'em in five years.
I'm sorry. What could I have
been thinking? I mean-

43:43.621 --> 43:46.613
I'm just on my way to the track.
So what?

43:49.994 --> 43:53.225
You goin' somewhere?
I'm droppin' out of Prescott.

43:53.297 --> 43:55.629
Where you gonna go?

43:55.699 --> 43:58.463
Somewhere where I don't have to
deal with people like you.

44:04.541 --> 44:08.375
There goes a troubled young guy.

44:08.445 --> 44:12.575
Gosh, it-it's a shame he had to
drive a kid like Phillip
out of the service.

44:12.650 --> 44:16.484
Yeah, I know.
Wait a second.

44:16.553 --> 44:19.283
Aren't you the guy who said
the military is no place-

44:20.424 --> 44:23.393
What's goin' on with you?
I was- I was wrong.

44:23.460 --> 44:27.362
I was wrong, all right. I was-
You were right. I was wrong.

44:29.133 --> 44:31.067
What made you change your mind?

44:31.135 --> 44:33.695
Uh, you,

44:33.771 --> 44:36.433
the coach,

44:36.507 --> 44:38.498
Phillip-
mostly Phillip.

44:38.575 --> 44:42.739
So I realized that, uh,
I was wrong.

44:42.813 --> 44:45.873
I'm not always right.
I was wrong.

44:47.217 --> 44:50.675
We better get to that track meet,
huh, so I can leap out of here?

44:50.754 --> 44:53.552
- I don't know how to run track, Al.
- <i>[ Man ] Let's go, Tommy.!</i>

44:53.624 --> 44:57.321
Oh. Well, you just-You pump-
Look, you pump your arms
and you pump your legs,

44:57.394 --> 45:00.386
and then you drive
through the tape.

45:00.464 --> 45:02.398
You were a runner too?

45:02.466 --> 45:04.764
No. But it sounds good,
doesn't it?

45:08.539 --> 45:10.632
What happens with Phillip?

45:10.708 --> 45:15.338
Uh, he goes to work at a place
called the Stonewall Bar.

45:15.412 --> 45:18.540
Oh, this was the-the birthplace
of the Gay Liberation movement,

45:18.615 --> 45:20.640
and he helped to get it started.

45:20.718 --> 45:25.087
- Martz?
- <i>Martz? Uh, he quit.</i>

45:25.155 --> 45:30.457
And, uh,
he became an athletic director
in a little college out west.

45:30.527 --> 45:34.725
- Tommy?
- <i>Tommy? He, uh, graduates</i>
<i>in a few weeks...</i>

45:34.798 --> 45:36.891
<i>and gets a commission</i>
<i>in the navy.</i>

45:36.967 --> 45:40.767
- <i>[ Whistle Blows ]</i>
- <i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Runners, to your marks.!</i>

45:43.073 --> 45:47.567
<i>You know, there's one thing that</i>
<i>I-I</i>- <i>Itjust doesn't figure for me.</i>

45:47.644 --> 45:49.942
- What's that?
- <i>[ Man ] Get set...</i>

45:50.013 --> 45:53.073
Well, was Tommy gay or not?

45:53.150 --> 45:55.812
Does it matter?

45:55.886 --> 45:57.911
<i>[ Starter Gun Fires ]</i>

46:03.193 --> 46:05.718
<i>You got a light balance on that?</i>
Dylan, come on, over here.

46:05.796 --> 46:09.493
Right here. Come on.
<i>Over here, with those</i>
<i>people in the background.</i>

46:09.566 --> 46:12.057
Hey, take the mike. Here.
Huh?

46:12.136 --> 46:16.038
The mike.
[ Man On Earpiece ] And now we'll be
switching live to Dylan Powell,

46:16.106 --> 46:19.906
who's at the scene of another
brutal strangulation murder
in Chinatown.

46:19.977 --> 46:23.378
You're on in five, four, three, two-

46:23.447 --> 46:24.971
Oh, boy.
