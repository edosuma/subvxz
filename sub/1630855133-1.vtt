- Hi.

01:49.849 --> 01:51.718
(both chuckling)

01:51.754 --> 01:52.851
- [America] I missed you.

01:52.886 --> 01:54.120
- I missed you so much.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.448
- Still, I can't believe
you're finally here.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.285
You, (laughs) um, I'm sorry.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.754

02:00.761 --> 02:01.624

02:06.263 --> 02:06.994
Do you wanna see our dorm?

02:07.029 --> 02:07.998
- Yes.

02:08.034 --> 02:09.066
- Because we're roommates.

02:09.102 --> 02:10.204
- Yeah.
- Yes, it's so awesome.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.101
Oh, my God.

02:12.137 --> 02:13.401
It is so good to see you.

02:19.279 --> 02:21.212
Yeah, the neighbors
are pretty decent.

02:21.247 --> 02:22.312
Though, the guy
across the hall vapes

02:22.347 --> 02:24.215
that horrendous
blueberry shit 24/7

02:24.250 --> 02:26.214
and also plays
Nickelback nonstop.

02:26.249 --> 02:27.314
- [Abby] Crazy.
- Yeah.

02:27.349 --> 02:28.681
Also, the showers suck.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.585
- I'm sure the
showers don't suck.

02:31.620 --> 02:34.054
So you really
spruced up the place.

02:34.089 --> 02:35.460
- Yeah.

02:35.495 --> 02:37.363
You know, I just wanted to
wait for you to get here.

02:38.293 --> 02:39.827
- What's his name?

02:41.636 --> 02:43.131
- Shepley.

02:43.166 --> 02:45.404
And he is so hot.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.634
- Hm.

02:47.669 --> 02:49.175
He doesn't have
any face piercings.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.238
- Yeah, well, sometimes
you just wake up one day

02:51.274 --> 02:53.206
and like pistachios.

02:53.242 --> 02:54.707
(both chuckle)

02:54.743 --> 02:56.311
He's really excited
to meet you though

02:56.346 --> 02:58.247
and he is taking us out tonight.

02:58.282 --> 03:00.312
- Oh no, Mer, I'm so tired.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.649
- [America] No.

03:01.684 --> 03:02.989
- I just got here, it
was a long bus ride.

03:03.025 --> 03:04.185
I just wanna stay
here and study.

03:04.221 --> 03:05.521
- It'll be so chill.

03:05.557 --> 03:07.289
Catholic school will let
you off for one night.

03:07.324 --> 03:08.288
Come on.
- No, I'm not going.

03:08.324 --> 03:09.796
- Yes, we're going.

03:09.832 --> 03:11.229
Take off the chastity belt

03:11.264 --> 03:12.324
and let's go.
- No, I don't wanna go.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.159
I have to study,

03:13.195 --> 03:14.161
Mer, Mer!

03:14.197 --> 03:15.395
(upbeat music)

03:15.430 --> 03:16.231
So where are we going?

03:16.266 --> 03:17.865
- Oh, it's a surprise.

03:18.707 --> 03:20.202
(man panting)

03:20.237 --> 03:21.506
- I think there's a guy,

03:22.776 --> 03:23.673
never mind.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.140
(crowd chattering)

03:28.175 --> 03:31.618
- Oh, hey, oh, by the way, we
don't talk about the circle.

03:31.654 --> 03:32.213
It's a secret.

03:32.248 --> 03:33.278
- What's a secret?

03:33.314 --> 03:34.753
- Exactly.

03:34.789 --> 03:37.423
(siren wailing)

03:41.523 --> 03:44.463
- Welcome to the bloodbath!

03:45.668 --> 03:46.225

03:46.260 --> 03:48.068
Whoo!

03:48.103 --> 03:49.531
If you're looking
for Economics 101,

03:49.566 --> 03:52.370
you are in the
wrong fucking place,

03:52.405 --> 03:55.301
but if you seek the
circle, this is Mecca.

03:55.337 --> 03:56.709
(crowd cheering)

03:56.745 --> 03:57.770
My name is Adam.

03:57.806 --> 03:59.980
I make the rules and
I call the fight.

04:00.016 --> 04:02.908
Tonight, we have
a new challenger,

04:02.943 --> 04:06.785
Eastern star varsity
wrestler Marek Young.

04:06.821 --> 04:09.554
(crowd booing)

04:10.485 --> 04:12.390
All right, all right.

04:12.425 --> 04:15.459
Now, reigning champ
needs no introduction,

04:15.494 --> 04:16.863
but because he scares
the shit out of me,

04:16.898 --> 04:18.531
I'm gonna give him one.

04:18.567 --> 04:21.398
So shake in your boots, boys,
and drop your panties, ladies.

04:21.433 --> 04:23.931
I give you Travis
"Mad Dog" Maddox!

04:26.201 --> 04:27.200
- Whoo!

04:27.235 --> 04:28.667
- Whoo!

04:28.702 --> 04:29.869
- You know, this isn't for me.

04:29.904 --> 04:32.610
I'm gonna go back to
the dorm and study.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.376
Hello.

I don't know if
that's good for me.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.078

distracted like that.

You're a liar.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.417
- Wow.

08:00.452 --> 08:02.688
- [Man] What are you doing?

08:03.925 --> 08:06.252
(cloth rips)

08:08.623 --> 08:09.823
- Listen, Abby,

08:09.859 --> 08:11.728
tuition payments
need to be issued

08:11.763 --> 08:13.895
through a bank account
or a credit card.

08:13.930 --> 08:15.530
There is accountability
to be considered,

08:15.566 --> 08:17.733
not to mention the taxes.

08:17.769 --> 08:19.604
- I'm in the process
of setting one up.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.872
- [Bursar] Can't your
parents help you out?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.806
- It's complicated.

08:24.842 --> 08:26.905
My mom, I haven't
spoken to in years,

08:26.940 --> 08:31.585
and my dad is not the best guy.

08:32.783 --> 08:33.881
- I'll allow it
for this semester,

08:33.916 --> 08:35.785
but sort yourself
out a bank account

08:35.820 --> 08:38.254
because this will not
be happening again.

08:38.289 --> 08:39.225
- Thank you.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.624
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

08:40.660 --> 08:42.459
So I talked to the
bursar this morning

08:42.495 --> 08:43.761
and she ended up
taking the cash.

08:43.796 --> 08:46.292
I mean, at least I'm
covered for the semester.

08:46.327 --> 08:48.429
- [America] Oh, what happens
when the money runs out?

08:48.465 --> 08:49.799
- I don't know.

08:49.834 --> 08:51.632
I'll find a job or
I'll get a scholarship.

08:51.668 --> 08:53.004
I'll figure something out.

08:53.040 --> 08:53.838
Incoming.

08:55.142 --> 08:56.208
- Hey, pumpkin.

08:56.243 --> 08:57.671
I got you a coffee here.

08:57.706 --> 08:58.607
- Thank you.
- Aw.

08:58.642 --> 09:00.275
- [Shepley] That's for you.

09:00.311 --> 09:01.114
- Thanks.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.477
- How was last night?

09:02.512 --> 09:03.380
Did you have fun?

09:03.416 --> 09:04.780
- Yeah, it was memorable.

09:04.816 --> 09:06.078
So what was the deal
with the one guy,

09:06.113 --> 09:08.154
the guy that was
covered in tattoos?

09:08.189 --> 09:09.022
- Oh, that's his cousin.

09:09.057 --> 09:10.586
He's a sophomore.

09:10.621 --> 09:12.751
- Oh, that guy goes to college?

09:12.786 --> 09:13.687
- [America] Mm-hm.

09:13.723 --> 09:15.393
- Wow, that is surprising.

09:15.428 --> 09:16.391
- [Travis] What's surprising?

09:16.426 --> 09:17.693
(Abby gasps)

09:17.729 --> 09:18.691
- [Shepley] That
you go to college.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.628
(Shepley giggles)

09:19.663 --> 09:20.895
- Why can't I go to college?

09:20.930 --> 09:21.527
- I didn't say it,
bro, she said it.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.531
- What?

09:22.566 --> 09:23.433
No, I didn't say that.

09:23.468 --> 09:24.733
- Sorry, have we met?

09:24.769 --> 09:25.766
- Oh, you don't
remember, Travis?

09:25.801 --> 09:27.306
You, you ruined her sweater.

09:27.341 --> 09:28.906
- I ruin a lot of sweaters.

09:28.941 --> 09:31.141
- I'm pretty sure they
retired bad double entendres.

09:31.177 --> 09:32.406
- Pigeon.

09:32.441 --> 09:33.210
- Abby.

09:33.246 --> 09:34.980
My name is Abby.

09:35.016 --> 09:35.608
- Travis.

09:35.644 --> 09:36.983
Travis Maddox.

09:37.018 --> 09:38.383
(lips smack)

09:38.418 --> 09:39.680
- Does that move really work?

09:39.715 --> 09:41.582
- No, not a single time,

09:41.617 --> 09:42.821
but it is sincere.

09:43.587 --> 09:45.422
- You're not my type.

09:45.457 --> 09:46.993
- I'm everybody's type.

09:47.029 --> 09:47.587
(Abby giggles)

09:47.623 --> 09:48.722
See, I got you.

09:48.758 --> 09:49.823
I got a smile out of you.

09:49.858 --> 09:51.894
- No, no, that was not a smile.

09:51.929 --> 09:53.900
That was actually a
condescending chuckle.

09:53.935 --> 09:54.734
- Yeah.

09:56.735 --> 09:58.771
Hey, I'm gonna come
over, all right?

09:59.570 --> 10:00.501
See you later, pigeon.

10:00.537 --> 10:01.537
(chair clanks)

10:01.572 --> 10:02.539
- Abby, my name is Abby.

10:02.575 --> 10:03.705
- [Travis] Well,
it's pigeon now.

10:03.740 --> 10:05.206
- Can you believe that guy?

10:06.512 --> 10:07.841
- And that is what brings us

10:07.876 --> 10:10.476
to the discovery of game theory.

10:10.511 --> 10:15.755
Now, game theory is a term
that was pioneered in the 1950s

10:16.555 --> 10:17.755
by mathematician John Nash.

10:17.790 --> 10:20.721
The term game is defined
as any interaction

10:20.757 --> 10:22.693
where each person's payoff

10:22.728 --> 10:24.756
is affected by the decisions.
- Mm.

10:24.792 --> 10:28.065
(gentle music)

10:28.101 --> 10:28.834
Wow.

10:36.571 --> 10:37.810
So hot.

10:40.447 --> 10:41.715
- That one's my favorite.

10:43.582 --> 10:45.246
It's too late to close it now.

10:46.821 --> 10:49.088
- Has anyone ever told you
that it's not very polite.

10:49.124 --> 10:50.086
- Young lady?

10:51.555 --> 10:53.091
What is your name?

10:53.126 --> 10:54.594
- Abby.

10:54.629 --> 10:57.226
- Ms. Abby, would you
care to educate us

10:57.261 --> 11:00.561
as to why Nash's equilibrium
is irrelevant to game theory?

11:00.597 --> 11:02.100
- Irrelevant?

11:02.135 --> 11:03.770
I can't.

11:03.805 --> 11:05.231
- Well, then perhaps you
should focus a little more on.

11:05.266 --> 11:07.967
- Well, but that's
because it is relevant.

11:08.002 --> 11:09.809
If equilibrium is achieved,

11:09.844 --> 11:11.808
that means that both players
can't increase payoff

11:11.843 --> 11:14.107
by changing decisions
unilaterally.

11:14.142 --> 11:15.914
It can also be
known as no regrets

11:15.949 --> 11:17.509
in the sense that once a
player does make a decision,

11:17.544 --> 11:20.787
they'll have no regrets
thinking about the consequences.

11:21.587 --> 11:23.990
- Have you been reading ahead?

11:24.025 --> 11:24.824
- A bit.

11:26.854 --> 11:27.789
- As I was saying.

11:27.824 --> 11:29.491
- Wow, pigeon, that was so hot.

11:29.527 --> 11:30.456
You got brains.

11:31.464 --> 11:32.698
- Why are you here?

11:32.733 --> 11:34.161
- Why are you sending
me a mixed signal?

11:34.196 --> 11:35.799
- There's nothing
mixed about my signals.

11:35.835 --> 11:37.733
- I just caught you
Insta stalking me.

11:37.768 --> 11:40.333
- I was not Insta stalking.

11:40.369 --> 11:42.804
Look, I'm going to save
you a lot of wasted time.

11:42.839 --> 11:44.574
You can stop the antics, okay?

11:44.610 --> 11:45.877
I'm not sleeping with you.

11:45.912 --> 11:48.746
- I'm not trying to sleep
with you or bag you.

11:48.782 --> 11:50.049
I'm just trying to
take you to dinner.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.251
- Bag me?

11:51.286 --> 11:52.918
What am I, groceries?

11:52.953 --> 11:55.081
Have you not read a newspaper
in the last four years?

11:55.117 --> 11:56.716
Men don't talk
like that anymore.

11:56.751 --> 11:57.923
- Which men?

11:59.022 --> 12:01.960
- The evolved men
of planet Earth.

12:01.996 --> 12:04.490
The ones who are actually in
touch with their feelings.

12:06.696 --> 12:07.933
I don't like you.

12:09.599 --> 12:10.400
(Abby sighs)

12:10.436 --> 12:11.937
Leave me alone.

12:14.676 --> 12:17.102
You're not going to let
this go, aren't you?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.878
- I'll pick you up at eight.

12:19.845 --> 12:21.780
- But wait, you
don't have my number.

12:21.815 --> 12:24.183
- [Professor] Interest
to play his part.

12:24.218 --> 12:25.285
(Abby sighs)

12:25.320 --> 12:28.481
(motor engine revving)

12:30.820 --> 12:34.457
(crickets chirping)

12:34.493 --> 12:36.792
(Travis sighs)

12:36.827 --> 12:38.161
- [Travis] You dress up for me?

12:38.196 --> 12:41.665
- No, I didn't have to
because this is not a date.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.664
- Well, I hope you're hungry.

12:43.700 --> 12:44.467
(helmet thuds)

12:44.503 --> 12:46.137
- No, no, no.

12:46.172 --> 12:48.471
I don't need this because I'm
not getting on that thing.

12:48.507 --> 12:50.141
- Yeah, you are.

12:50.176 --> 12:52.304
- Do you know the statistics
of motorcycles in accidents?

12:52.339 --> 12:55.313
No, I'm not putting
on that thing.

12:55.349 --> 12:56.447
- Yeah, you are.

12:56.482 --> 12:59.880
(helmet thudding)

12:59.915 --> 13:01.987
I can do this all night.

13:04.820 --> 13:05.991
- (sighs) Fine.

13:07.361 --> 13:08.594
(scanner beeps)

13:08.630 --> 13:09.159
- [Travis] Thanks, Miguel.
- Yep.

13:11.295 --> 13:12.959
- You're really not gonna
let me buy you dinner?

13:12.994 --> 13:14.835
- No, this isn't a date.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.667
- Yes, I'm aware.

13:16.702 --> 13:18.030
You've said that twice now.

13:18.066 --> 13:19.237
- [Abby] Oh, you noticed.

13:19.272 --> 13:20.604
- Mm-hm.

13:20.639 --> 13:21.804
That and your outfit,

13:21.839 --> 13:23.805
which screams "I detest Travis."

13:23.840 --> 13:25.107
- I don't detest you.

13:25.143 --> 13:27.376
I just don't like being
a foregone conclusion

13:27.411 --> 13:31.449
for one of the many, many,
many notches on your bedpost.

13:31.485 --> 13:32.779
- Oh, you're smart.

13:32.814 --> 13:34.382
I like that.

13:34.417 --> 13:35.982
- Something you're probably
not used to in a woman.

13:36.017 --> 13:38.488
- Oh, I'm striking out.

13:38.523 --> 13:39.921
I surrender.

13:39.956 --> 13:41.461
We can at least be friends.

13:41.496 --> 13:43.061
- Friends, but with no benefits.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.764
- We're not sleeping together.

13:45.799 --> 13:47.664
I won't even think
about the benefits

13:47.699 --> 13:49.100
unless you want me to.

13:49.135 --> 13:52.037
- No, that can't happen so
that we can stay friends.

13:53.373 --> 13:54.204
- Friends.

13:55.242 --> 13:56.041
Friends.

13:58.043 --> 13:59.977
I've been coming to
this place for years.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.214
My family home is only
three miles that way.

14:02.249 --> 14:03.344
- Aw.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.681
You couldn't move farther
away from your mommy?

14:05.717 --> 14:06.953
- No, that's not it.

14:08.053 --> 14:10.554
- Her grilled cheese
was just that good?

14:10.590 --> 14:11.985
- Well, she's dead.

14:12.020 --> 14:13.157
- (chuckles) Shut up.

14:16.430 --> 14:17.594
Are you serious?

14:17.629 --> 14:19.930
(Travis chuckles)

14:19.965 --> 14:22.361
I'm such an asshole,
I'm so sorry.

14:22.396 --> 14:24.029
I feel horrible.
- It's okay, it's okay.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.703
I was only three.

14:25.738 --> 14:27.000
- Okay, I'm not that sorry.

14:27.035 --> 14:28.073
Get your hand off me.

14:29.905 --> 14:31.076
How's your dad?

14:32.111 --> 14:33.774
- He's still alive, so
you can make fun of him.

14:33.810 --> 14:34.577
(Abby chuckles)

14:34.613 --> 14:35.847
He's a good man.

14:35.882 --> 14:37.076
He raised five boys
all on his own.

14:37.111 --> 14:38.679
- Five Maddox brothers?

14:38.714 --> 14:40.116
- Yeah.

14:40.151 --> 14:42.153
Thomas, Taylor, Tyler,
Trent, and Travis.

14:43.318 --> 14:45.056
If you wanna get
good at fighting,

14:45.091 --> 14:46.118
having four older brothers
beat your ass daily

14:46.154 --> 14:47.491
is a good place to start.

14:47.526 --> 14:48.291
- Why do it?

14:49.761 --> 14:51.060
- College ain't cheap.

14:51.095 --> 14:52.764
Fighting is a good
way to make money.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.300
- Just seems
unnecessarily risky.

14:55.335 --> 14:56.436
- Why?

14:56.471 --> 14:57.735
You worried about me?

14:57.770 --> 14:59.533
- Not even in the slightest.

15:01.003 --> 15:02.567
- What's your story?

15:02.603 --> 15:05.807
- Just your average girl
from your ordinary town.

15:05.842 --> 15:08.039
- Oh, mom and dad?

15:08.075 --> 15:09.177
- One of each.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.347
- Wow, you're a
wealth of information.

15:11.383 --> 15:13.483
- Well, I can't give away
all the goods in one night.

15:13.519 --> 15:14.816
- Most do.

15:14.852 --> 15:16.121
I actually enjoy it.

15:17.823 --> 15:19.050
Are you seriously leaving?

15:19.086 --> 15:20.625
- Dinner's over.

15:20.660 --> 15:22.127
- We just got started.

15:22.695 --> 15:23.997
- Good night, Travis.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.193
(car door thuds)

15:27.228 --> 15:31.070
(gentle instrumental music)

15:34.069 --> 15:35.772
- Hey, purple sweater.

15:35.807 --> 15:37.241
Little help?
- Yeah.

15:39.007 --> 15:39.741
(frisbee thuds)

15:39.777 --> 15:40.743
- [Crowd] Ooh!

15:40.779 --> 15:42.040
- Oh, no! (grunting)

15:42.076 --> 15:43.141
- Oh, my god.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.780
(Parker grunting)

15:44.816 --> 15:45.616
- [Passerby] Police.

15:45.651 --> 15:47.420
- He's, he's fine.

15:47.455 --> 15:48.354
(Parker grunting)

15:48.390 --> 15:48.914
Okay, it's okay.

15:48.950 --> 15:50.048
He's okay.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.084
- I'm fine.

15:51.119 --> 15:52.358
- Okay, are you okay?

15:52.394 --> 15:53.387
- Oh, I'm fine.

15:53.422 --> 15:55.261
- Okay, I'm so sorry.
(Parker grunting)

15:55.297 --> 15:56.360
- Oh, God.

15:56.396 --> 15:57.422
Oh!

15:57.458 --> 15:58.929
- You're so cute
and you're crying,

15:58.965 --> 16:00.192
I swear.
- I'm not, I'm not crying.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.498
It's, uh, it's the wind.

16:02.534 --> 16:04.902
How long have you been captain
of the Frisbee club? (groans)

16:04.938 --> 16:06.366
- Oh, no, no, no,
I'm not captain

16:06.402 --> 16:07.373
of the Frisbee club.
- Oh, it was, uh,

16:07.409 --> 16:08.102
it was a joke.

16:08.137 --> 16:09.508
It was a joke, I'll be okay.

16:09.544 --> 16:10.475
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.345
- Hi, I'm Abby.

16:12.381 --> 16:12.974
- I'm gonna go.

16:13.009 --> 16:15.178
I'm, I'm gonna wobble.

16:15.213 --> 16:16.981
- You should put some
ice on your balls.

16:17.016 --> 16:19.177
- You should put
some ice on my balls.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.281
- Okay. (chuckles)

16:20.316 --> 16:22.482
- [Parker] Oh,
yeah, I'm gonna go.

16:22.517 --> 16:24.722
- It was really nice
to meet you, Parker.

16:24.758 --> 16:25.558
(ball whooshes and thuds)

16:25.593 --> 16:27.360
Oh!
(Parker groans)

16:27.396 --> 16:28.461
- Thanks, man.

16:28.496 --> 16:29.362
- [Man] Fuck you!

16:29.398 --> 16:30.327
- Be careful!

16:31.499 --> 16:34.364
(water splashing)

16:35.362 --> 16:39.204
(gentle instrumental music)

16:40.242 --> 16:41.074
Ow!

16:42.343 --> 16:43.238
Ow.

16:43.273 --> 16:45.378
Could someone turn
the water back on?

16:45.414 --> 16:46.473
(bags thudding)

16:46.508 --> 16:48.377
So the RA said we're
gonna be without water

16:48.413 --> 16:50.982
for the next 24 hours, so
it's just for the night.

16:51.018 --> 16:53.180
Are you sure Shepley
is cool with this?

16:53.215 --> 16:55.218
- Hey, Abby's staying over.

16:55.254 --> 16:57.488
- Just stay out of
Travis's room, all right?

16:57.523 --> 16:58.051
- What?

16:58.086 --> 16:59.354
You didn't tell me

16:59.390 --> 17:00.285
that Travis lives here.
- No, of course I did.

17:00.321 --> 17:00.987
No, remember, I told you.

17:01.023 --> 17:02.158
No, no, no, no,

17:02.193 --> 17:03.224
no, no, no.
- I'm not staying here.

17:03.260 --> 17:04.425
- Abby, Abby!
- No, I'm leaving.

17:04.460 --> 17:05.961
- No, I promise you
will never see him.

17:05.996 --> 17:06.930
He's never even here.

17:06.965 --> 17:08.163
You won't see him, I promise.

17:08.199 --> 17:09.363
You have to stay,
It'll be so fun.

17:09.399 --> 17:11.432
Hey, tell her that
Travis will be okay.

17:11.467 --> 17:12.638
- [Shepley] Oh, he won't
care, he likes you.

17:12.673 --> 17:13.736
- He doesn't know me.

17:13.772 --> 17:14.707
- He likes you.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.675
We're gonna have a sleepover.

17:15.710 --> 17:17.509
So much fun, we'll make s'mores.

17:17.545 --> 17:18.476
Hey, let's go.

17:18.511 --> 17:19.609
- Bye.

17:19.644 --> 17:20.410
- Bye.

17:21.813 --> 17:25.146
(crowd chattering)

17:25.181 --> 17:28.451
- [Mick] Abby, babe, it's Dad.

17:29.656 --> 17:31.322
Where'd you go?

17:31.357 --> 17:35.392
Could you return the call
or at least text me back?

17:37.829 --> 17:40.394
(Carmen moaning)

17:40.430 --> 17:44.800
(Carmen speaking in
foreign language)

17:44.836 --> 17:46.103
(door clicks)

17:46.139 --> 17:49.541
(Carmen speaking in
foreign language)

17:49.577 --> 17:50.608
(Carmen moaning)

17:50.643 --> 17:51.637
(door thuds)

17:51.672 --> 17:52.973
- [Abby] Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

17:53.009 --> 17:53.811
(gentle music)

17:53.846 --> 17:55.812
(door creaks and clicks)

17:55.848 --> 17:57.348
(footsteps tapping)

17:57.383 --> 17:59.683
- [Carmen] Excuse me.
(speaks in foreign language)

17:59.719 --> 18:00.312
- [Abby] Sure.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.385
- [Carmen] Okay, merci.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.493
(door thuds)

18:07.529 --> 18:09.822
(gentle music)

18:18.738 --> 18:19.804
(floor creaks)

18:19.840 --> 18:21.266
- [Abby] (screams) Jesus.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.236
- Enjoy the show?

18:22.271 --> 18:23.570
- You scared the crap out of me.

18:23.606 --> 18:25.405
- You know that's not
a very attractive idiom

18:25.441 --> 18:26.978
once you stop and
think about it.

18:27.014 --> 18:28.506
- Because in your
sexist universe,

18:28.541 --> 18:30.413
women don't actually defecate?

18:30.449 --> 18:32.615
- Wow, that's a perfect
word for someone like you.

18:32.650 --> 18:36.220
Did you know that the saying
used to be "bejesus out of me?"

18:36.256 --> 18:39.219
- Your friend gave this
to me to give to you.

18:39.255 --> 18:41.119
(paper crumples and thuds)

18:41.154 --> 18:42.456
What?

18:42.491 --> 18:43.755
The woman that you
just had sex with

18:43.791 --> 18:46.229
gives you her number and
you just throw it away?

18:46.264 --> 18:47.900
- That's not her
leaving her number.

18:47.936 --> 18:49.532
That's her marking
her territory.

18:49.567 --> 18:51.433
- Well, then maybe you
shouldn't have sex with her.

18:51.468 --> 18:53.670
- I don't remember
promising her a thing.

18:53.705 --> 18:54.900
- Wow.

18:54.935 --> 18:56.773
You embody everything that
is wrong with your gender.

18:56.809 --> 18:57.774
She's an adult.

18:57.810 --> 18:58.776
I'm an adult.

18:58.811 --> 19:00.271
It was consensual.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.811
Look at this.

19:01.847 --> 19:03.445
- Consent date.

19:03.481 --> 19:05.150
- [Travis] Can never be
too careful nowadays.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.945
- How many women do you
have contracts with?

19:06.980 --> 19:09.514
- [Travis] No idea, I'm a
quality guy over quantity.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.649
- (groans) I'm gonna throw up.

19:11.685 --> 19:13.456
- Well, my bedroom
is down the hall

19:13.492 --> 19:15.554
and the bed is all yours
for when you wanna crash.

19:15.590 --> 19:16.825
- I'm not gonna
sleep in your bed.

19:16.860 --> 19:17.929
- Why?

19:17.964 --> 19:19.897
No one but me sleeps in my bed.

19:19.932 --> 19:21.166
My bed is sacred ground.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.796
- Well, then why would I
be allowed in your bed?

19:22.831 --> 19:24.866
- Are you planning on
having sex with me tonight?

19:24.901 --> 19:25.733
- No.

19:26.906 --> 19:27.933
- Then it's settled.

19:31.778 --> 19:33.945
(door clicks)

19:33.980 --> 19:35.612
Wow, make yourself at home.

19:35.647 --> 19:38.281
- Sorry, I just have a big
10 a.m. Bio test to cram for,

19:38.316 --> 19:39.646
but I can move back
to the kitchen.

19:39.681 --> 19:41.017
- No, you're fine,
stay where you're at.

19:41.052 --> 19:42.181
Don't be silly. (groans)

19:42.216 --> 19:43.552
- Thank you.

19:43.588 --> 19:44.816
- Do you want me to make
you some tea or something?

19:44.851 --> 19:47.055
- No, but, uh, my
highlighter just died.

19:47.090 --> 19:48.356
Can I borrow one?

19:48.392 --> 19:49.790
- Oh, yeah, check
the top drawer.

19:52.061 --> 19:52.926
Wait, um,

19:52.962 --> 19:53.794
no.

19:55.096 --> 19:56.800
- Wow.

19:56.836 --> 19:57.829
That's a lot.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.768
- Is practicing safe
sex a crime? (chuckles)

20:02.611 --> 20:03.671
- What's this?

20:03.706 --> 20:05.073
- It's not a highlighter,
I'll tell you that.

20:05.108 --> 20:08.281
(device vibrating)

20:09.880 --> 20:11.078
Um.

20:11.114 --> 20:11.949
- It's a yo-yo?

20:11.984 --> 20:13.916
- No, definitely not.

20:13.952 --> 20:14.819
It's awkward.

20:14.855 --> 20:16.421
I'm gonna go shower.

20:22.126 --> 20:25.463
(disinfectant hissing)

20:26.866 --> 20:29.599
(device vibrating)

20:30.969 --> 20:34.300
(Travis whistling)

20:34.336 --> 20:37.442
(crickets chirping)

20:39.978 --> 20:42.513
(gentle music)

21:00.669 --> 21:02.962
(Travis sighs)

21:11.177 --> 21:16.045
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

21:16.081 --> 21:19.451
(singers vocalizing)

21:26.521 --> 21:30.660
- (giggling) What are you doing?

21:31.458 --> 21:34.667
(cat squeaking)

21:34.703 --> 21:36.936
(Abby laughs)

21:36.971 --> 21:38.803
Bad kitty.
(cat squeaking)

21:38.839 --> 21:41.673
Mouse. (giggles)

21:41.708 --> 21:42.771
Mouse.

21:45.275 --> 21:48.573
(Abby giggling)
- Abby.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.715
Pigeon.
- Really cute.

21:50.751 --> 21:51.483
How much?

21:52.213 --> 21:53.579
- Um.

21:53.615 --> 21:56.620
It's not what do
you think it is.

21:58.155 --> 21:59.222
Abby, you're.

21:59.257 --> 22:01.287
- Wait, what are you doing?

22:01.323 --> 22:03.125
(Abby screaming)

22:03.160 --> 22:05.225
(wings whooshing)

22:05.261 --> 22:07.228
(door clicks)

22:07.263 --> 22:08.295
- [Shepley] Abby!

22:08.330 --> 22:09.363
- [America] Abby!

22:09.399 --> 22:10.332
- [Travis] What the heck?

22:10.367 --> 22:11.266
- [Abby] What is wrong with you?

22:11.301 --> 22:12.034
- I didn't do anything.

22:12.070 --> 22:13.272
You touched me.

22:13.307 --> 22:14.973
- Oh, says the man with
the raging hard-on.

22:15.008 --> 22:16.208
You should be locked up.

22:16.243 --> 22:17.537
- You're the sleepy
cock toucher.

22:17.572 --> 22:19.410
I didn't put your hand there.

22:19.446 --> 22:21.307
And if you bothered to
read a biology textbook,

22:21.343 --> 22:22.710
you'd find out

22:22.746 --> 22:23.909
that it's called
parasympathetic nerve response

22:23.944 --> 22:24.983
and you'd know that
if you knew anything

22:25.018 --> 22:26.345
about biology or men.

22:26.381 --> 22:27.885
- Oh, shit, Bio!

22:27.921 --> 22:28.819
What time is it?

22:28.854 --> 22:29.821
- 9:42.

22:29.857 --> 22:30.583
- Oh, my God.

22:30.618 --> 22:32.618
- [Both] What are you wearing?

22:32.654 --> 22:33.593
- We were playing.
- We were

22:33.628 --> 22:34.460
playing.

22:35.491 --> 22:36.424
- Let me give you a ride.

22:36.459 --> 22:38.464
- No, this is just a madhouse.

22:39.667 --> 22:40.832
A nurse?

22:40.868 --> 22:41.698
- Yeah, no, I.

22:42.299 --> 22:43.530
- Sorry, excuse me.

22:43.565 --> 22:45.836
(gentle instrumental music)

22:45.871 --> 22:46.937
Sorry.

22:46.972 --> 22:47.938
Oh, my God!

22:47.974 --> 22:50.168
(Abby groans)

22:51.307 --> 22:54.414
(crowd chattering)

22:55.278 --> 22:57.813
(phone beeps)

22:59.149 --> 23:00.547
I slipped.

23:00.582 --> 23:02.247
But I still aced my Bio test.

23:02.282 --> 23:04.955
- (chuckles) Well, I'm glad
you're not drawing attention

23:04.990 --> 23:05.550
to yourself.

23:05.586 --> 23:07.455
- [Abby] Hilarious.

23:07.490 --> 23:08.990
- Okay, I have to run to class,

23:09.025 --> 23:10.326
but I want a full play-by-play
of what happened last night.

23:10.361 --> 23:11.393
- Nothing happened last night.

23:11.428 --> 23:12.126
- Yeah?
- I do not like him.

23:12.161 --> 23:13.565
- Yeah,

23:13.601 --> 23:14.393
and that's why you're giving
him a good morning handy.

23:14.429 --> 23:15.963
(phone beeps)

23:18.600 --> 23:19.871
Is Mick still bothering you?

23:19.907 --> 23:20.965
- [Abby] Yeah.

23:21.001 --> 23:22.909
- You got to cut him
out of your life.

23:22.944 --> 23:24.109
- He is out of my life.

23:24.144 --> 23:25.110
- He is not out of your life

23:25.145 --> 23:26.473
because he is still texting you.

23:26.508 --> 23:28.043
I-I gotta go to class.

23:28.078 --> 23:28.844
- What?

23:32.346 --> 23:33.480
- Hey.

23:33.515 --> 23:35.350
Parker, we meet again.

23:35.385 --> 23:37.884
- Abby, are you okay?

23:37.919 --> 23:40.555
- Yeah, yeah, it's a
long story. (chuckles)

23:40.591 --> 23:42.858
Hey, um, how are
your, your balls?

23:43.798 --> 23:44.357
- Not good.

23:44.393 --> 23:45.391
- Oh, my God.

23:45.427 --> 23:47.028
- That's okay.

23:47.063 --> 23:50.668
I think they said I had a 20%
chance of a normal sex life.

23:52.601 --> 23:53.531
- Are you messing with me?

23:53.566 --> 23:54.634
- Not funny?

23:54.669 --> 23:57.371
- No, it was, it was hilarious.

23:57.407 --> 23:59.641
Well, um, okay, bye.

23:59.676 --> 24:01.373
- Do you have dinner
plans tonight?

24:01.408 --> 24:02.979
- Me?

24:03.014 --> 24:04.283
- Yes.

24:04.319 --> 24:06.514
- No, I-I-I-I do not
have dinner plans.

24:06.549 --> 24:08.512
- I know a great Italian spot.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.821
- Um, um.

24:11.856 --> 24:13.522
- Is that a, is that?
- (gasps) No, that is a yes.

24:13.558 --> 24:15.186
Yes, I would love
that very much.

24:15.222 --> 24:18.196
Pick me up at seven, I
live at Tucker dormitory.

24:18.231 --> 24:20.029
- Sure, I'll pick you up then.

24:20.064 --> 24:20.897
- Okay.

24:20.933 --> 24:21.765
Bye.

24:23.333 --> 24:24.836
(gentle music)

24:24.872 --> 24:25.703
I see you!

24:29.406 --> 24:32.140
(laughs) Oh, Parker.

24:32.175 --> 24:33.504
Really?

24:33.540 --> 24:34.441
Thank you.

24:34.476 --> 24:35.342
Thank you, Parker.

24:35.378 --> 24:36.543
(phone beeps)

24:36.579 --> 24:38.750
Oh, no way, Travis Maddox.

24:38.785 --> 24:42.415
You can keep knocking but I
am not gonna answer that door.

24:42.451 --> 24:45.420
No way. (laughs)

24:45.456 --> 24:46.625
I'll see you soon, Parker.

24:48.458 --> 24:49.324
- Thanks again, Sonny.

24:49.359 --> 24:50.057
- Anytime, doctor.

24:51.427 --> 24:52.792
- Doctor Hayes.

24:52.828 --> 24:54.727
- He's jumping
the gun, you know.

24:54.762 --> 24:56.562
I just started, that's all.

24:56.598 --> 24:59.002
- Wow, fancy-fancy.

24:59.037 --> 24:59.836
- Yeah.

25:01.941 --> 25:02.773
Wow.

25:04.110 --> 25:05.743
- Are you on call?

25:05.778 --> 25:08.677
- No, I-I just got a heads-up
about a show tonight.

25:08.713 --> 25:10.646
- Oh, oh, I can get
my own ride home.

25:10.681 --> 25:12.649
- No, no, no, we-we
should both go.

25:12.685 --> 25:15.249
Unless you've got work
or sick of seeing me.

25:15.284 --> 25:16.319
- No.

25:16.354 --> 25:17.651
No, I would love to go.

25:17.686 --> 25:19.592
- This is-this is gonna be fun.

25:20.456 --> 25:21.858
(Abby chuckles)

25:21.893 --> 25:23.926
- You know, I've always wanted
to see Titus Andronicus.

25:23.961 --> 25:27.330
It's considered to be
Shakespeare's most violent play.

25:27.366 --> 25:28.632
- You don't mind violence?

25:28.668 --> 25:30.768
- No, I was something
of a tomboy growing up.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.667
- Well, then you're
in for a treat.

25:33.702 --> 25:34.970
- Ooh, I guess it's starting.

25:36.675 --> 25:37.836
- (speaks indistinctly)
he's a state champ.

25:37.871 --> 25:39.544
He's gonna come out swinging.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.838
He's not gonna be
wasting any sort of time.

25:40.874 --> 25:42.241
Okay, what are you doing?

25:43.747 --> 25:45.280
- Abby hasn't texted
me back today.

25:45.316 --> 25:46.218
- Oh, my God.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.649
Would you forget about Abby?

25:47.685 --> 25:49.050
Have you, have
you seen this guy?

25:49.085 --> 25:52.955
He's got a white robe and
a belt that's huge, okay?

25:52.991 --> 25:54.620
I mean, you're acting like
the kissing booth over here.

25:54.655 --> 25:56.324
You need to focus.

25:56.359 --> 25:57.490
(hand slaps)

25:57.526 --> 25:58.997
- I am focused.

25:59.033 --> 26:01.895
(hands slapping)

26:01.931 --> 26:03.836
- (scoffs) That's
the Travis we need.

26:03.871 --> 26:05.263
Come on.

26:05.299 --> 26:07.701
- I just don't know why
she hasn't texted me back.

26:07.736 --> 26:08.803
I'm gonna go outside and see

26:08.838 --> 26:10.140
if I can get better
cell reception.

26:10.176 --> 26:10.943
(upbeat music)

26:10.979 --> 26:12.640
- We're dead.

26:12.675 --> 26:15.314
(crowd cheering and clapping)

26:15.350 --> 26:17.049
- Oh, wow, modern
interpretation.

26:17.085 --> 26:18.013
I love Shakespeare.

26:19.415 --> 26:20.351
(foot thuds)

26:20.386 --> 26:23.386
(crowd cheering and clapping)

26:23.421 --> 26:24.355
- All right, all right.

26:24.390 --> 26:26.921
Next up, we have the main event:

26:26.956 --> 26:29.992
Freddy Heflin versus
Travis "Mad Dog" Maddox!

26:33.201 --> 26:34.694
- This is gonna be great.

26:34.729 --> 26:37.032
Travis is a real animal.

26:40.602 --> 26:42.068
Are you okay?

26:42.104 --> 26:44.969
- Yeah, yeah, it's just
a little hot in here.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.474
I'm gonna go find a bathroom.

26:47.510 --> 26:48.576
(door clicks)

26:48.611 --> 26:49.748
- What the fuck, Abby?

26:51.013 --> 26:52.682
You don't respond
to any of my texts,

26:52.718 --> 26:54.814
and now you're here
dressed like that

26:54.849 --> 26:55.749
with your titties hanging out.

26:55.784 --> 26:57.214
- They are not hanging out.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.419
This is a tasteful
amount of cleavage.

26:59.454 --> 27:00.391
- Yeah?

27:00.426 --> 27:01.292
Well, they're distracting me.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.461
- Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.657
It's all about
you, you egomaniac.

27:04.693 --> 27:06.160
- I must break you.

27:07.232 --> 27:08.063
- Go for it.

27:09.699 --> 27:11.233
- That's who you're fighting?

27:11.268 --> 27:11.962
- Yes.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.564
- That guy could kill you.

27:13.599 --> 27:16.570
- Is this your weird little
way of admitting you like me?

27:16.606 --> 27:17.803
- I don't like you.

27:17.839 --> 27:18.870
But I do worry about you.

27:18.906 --> 27:20.071
I worry about the planet.

27:20.107 --> 27:22.009
They're two very
different things.

27:22.044 --> 27:24.514
- Okay, well, if it
puts your mind at ease,

27:24.549 --> 27:25.710
he's not even gonna hit me.

27:25.745 --> 27:26.746
- Hilarious.

27:26.781 --> 27:27.579
- Are you doubting me?

27:27.614 --> 27:28.446
- Yeah.

27:29.554 --> 27:30.585
- Care to make it interesting?

27:30.620 --> 27:32.090
- Make it interesting?

27:32.125 --> 27:33.025
Like a bet?

27:33.061 --> 27:33.586
- [Travis] Yeah.

27:33.622 --> 27:34.719
- I don't bet.

27:34.755 --> 27:35.922
(door clicks)

27:35.958 --> 27:36.756
- Come on, Travis,
they need you.

27:36.791 --> 27:38.459
- Yeah, just a minute.

27:38.494 --> 27:39.860
How's this?

27:39.896 --> 27:42.026
If he manages to
lay a hand on me,

27:42.061 --> 27:44.365
I'll go without sex for a week.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.663
- Ooh.

27:45.699 --> 27:46.706
- A month.

27:47.603 --> 27:48.436
Three months.

27:48.472 --> 27:49.938
- Three months?

27:49.973 --> 27:52.141
That's impossible
for someone like you.

27:52.176 --> 27:56.477
- Okay, and if I win, you have
to stay with me for a month.

27:56.512 --> 27:57.613
- You're on.

27:57.648 --> 27:59.015
But get it through your head,

28:00.651 --> 28:02.315
I am never having sex with you.

28:05.186 --> 28:06.852
- I don't wanna have
sex with you, pidge.

28:06.887 --> 28:08.893
I wanna be around you.

28:09.758 --> 28:10.730
You're good for me.

28:13.101 --> 28:16.098
(crowd cheering)

28:17.171 --> 28:18.532
You are handsome.

28:18.568 --> 28:19.335
- You're dead.

28:19.371 --> 28:20.765
(Freddy grunts)

28:20.801 --> 28:23.501
(crowd cheering)

28:25.078 --> 28:25.772
- Hah.

28:25.808 --> 28:27.940
You are handsome as hell.

28:27.975 --> 28:29.243
No wonder you're the champ.

28:30.349 --> 28:31.278
Champ of my heart.

28:32.781 --> 28:33.779
(punches whooshing)

28:33.815 --> 28:35.015
- Come on, hit him!

28:35.050 --> 28:36.448
- You ever hiked
Brokeback Mountain?

28:37.752 --> 28:38.885
Do you wanna?

28:38.920 --> 28:40.419
- I'll be gentle, you know.

28:42.124 --> 28:43.895
- How are you gonna
kill me, big boy?

28:45.794 --> 28:46.658
(punches whooshing)

28:46.694 --> 28:47.525
Giddy up.

28:55.268 --> 28:57.109
- [Woman]
(indistinctly) kill you!

28:57.145 --> 28:58.243
(crowd cheering)

28:58.278 --> 29:00.906
(Freddy growling)

29:00.941 --> 29:02.179
- What are you doing?

29:02.215 --> 29:03.109
- Shut up.

29:03.144 --> 29:04.346
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

29:04.382 --> 29:05.683
- Hit him!

29:05.718 --> 29:07.251
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

29:07.287 --> 29:08.251
(cage clanks)

29:08.287 --> 29:09.217
Just once!

29:10.184 --> 29:11.552
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

29:11.587 --> 29:13.787
(body thuds)

29:13.822 --> 29:15.758
- Oh-oh, baby fell down.

29:15.794 --> 29:17.555
Get back in your
crib, little baby.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.094
(Freddy growls)

29:21.129 --> 29:22.728
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

29:22.764 --> 29:23.629
(cage clanks)

29:23.665 --> 29:24.496
Oh-ho-ho.

29:25.669 --> 29:27.101
Now, (indistinctly).

29:27.137 --> 29:29.540
So I'm saving the upper
left sock throw for you.

29:29.575 --> 29:31.008
- [Freddy] Fuck you, bitch.

29:32.412 --> 29:34.006
- You cover those up.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.642
- [Freddy] You bitch. (growls)

29:35.677 --> 29:36.978
- Excuse me.

29:37.013 --> 29:38.946
(Freddy grunting)
(fists whooshing)

29:38.982 --> 29:43.916
(Travis grunting)
(fists thudding)

29:43.951 --> 29:45.952
- Just once, hit him!

29:45.988 --> 29:49.689
(Freddy grunts)
(fists thuds)

29:49.725 --> 29:50.525
- Here we go!

29:50.560 --> 29:52.362
(kick thuds)

29:52.398 --> 29:55.098
(fists thudding)

29:58.602 --> 30:01.236
(gentle music)

30:05.741 --> 30:08.141
(crowd cheering)

30:08.176 --> 30:11.943
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Travis Maddox!

30:11.978 --> 30:14.980
(Travis grunting)

30:15.016 --> 30:16.752
- Pack your bags, pigeon.

30:16.787 --> 30:19.151
You're coming home with me.

30:19.187 --> 30:22.427
(Travis imitating
monkey whooping)

30:22.462 --> 30:23.258
- How did this happen?

30:24.357 --> 30:28.560
(Travis imitating
monkey whooping)

30:29.998 --> 30:32.403
- Hey, I got you a water.

30:32.438 --> 30:34.899
(Travis grunting)

30:34.935 --> 30:36.271
What's going on?

30:37.311 --> 30:39.612
(gentle music)

30:39.647 --> 30:41.707
(sighs) I just need
to process this.

30:41.743 --> 30:43.075
- I know.

30:43.110 --> 30:45.075
- We go out for a great dinner.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.847
Get on really well.

30:46.882 --> 30:48.415
I take you to a show.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.423
I leave you for five minutes.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.956
And during that time,

30:52.992 --> 30:56.690
you've decided to move
in with Travis Maddox.

30:56.726 --> 30:58.196
- I lost a bet.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.057
- Right.

30:59.092 --> 31:00.059
- We're just friends.

31:00.094 --> 31:01.431
I mean, we're not even friends.

31:01.467 --> 31:02.768
We're nothing.

31:02.803 --> 31:04.899
I had a really nice
time with you tonight

31:04.934 --> 31:06.301
and I would love to do it again.

31:07.935 --> 31:09.875
(Parker chuckles)

31:09.911 --> 31:12.307
Do you think I can, I can
get a good-night kiss?

31:15.976 --> 31:16.878
(Travis screams)

31:16.913 --> 31:18.347
(Abby screams)
- Oh, God!

31:18.383 --> 31:19.349
No!

31:19.385 --> 31:20.318
- Travis!

31:20.354 --> 31:21.413
- Time to go.

31:21.449 --> 31:22.951
- Yeah, you need to, you
need to leave the car.

31:22.987 --> 31:26.388
- He is not going
to do anything.

31:26.424 --> 31:27.993
See?

31:28.028 --> 31:28.955
- No, he's gonna hurt me.
- He's not gonna hurt you.

31:28.991 --> 31:29.789
- No, he's gonna hurt me.

31:29.825 --> 31:30.894
- Open the door.

31:30.929 --> 31:31.660
- Get out of the car.
- [Abby] No.

31:31.695 --> 31:32.563
(knuckles rapping)

31:32.599 --> 31:33.499
- Please get out the car!

31:33.534 --> 31:34.466
- You are strong, it's okay.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.434
- No, he is a maniac.

31:36.470 --> 31:37.836
He is gonna hurt me,

31:37.871 --> 31:38.935
leave the car!
- He's not going to hurt.

31:38.970 --> 31:40.703
- Leave the car now!
- Oh, my God.

31:40.739 --> 31:43.104
- Get out the fucking car!

31:43.139 --> 31:44.741
- Open the door!
- You're being insane.

31:44.776 --> 31:45.976
Okay, okay.
- Leave the car.

31:46.011 --> 31:48.445
Go, go, leave the car!
- Okay, I'm leaving.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.446
Okay, okay.

31:49.482 --> 31:50.380
- Go, please.

31:50.415 --> 31:51.547
Go now.

31:51.583 --> 31:52.316
- [Travis] Okay.

31:52.351 --> 31:53.812
- Okay.

31:53.847 --> 31:55.147
Okay.

31:55.182 --> 31:56.821
(Travis screams)
- Oh, Jesus.

31:56.856 --> 31:59.691
Yeah, on it, yeah.
(Travis giggling)

31:59.727 --> 32:00.991
(Travis imitating
monkey whooping)

32:01.027 --> 32:02.494
- [Abby] I cannot believe
this is happening.

32:02.529 --> 32:03.828
- Well, for the record,

32:03.864 --> 32:04.794
I didn't think you'd
really settle up.

32:04.829 --> 32:05.862
- Well, I made a bet, I lost.

32:05.898 --> 32:08.133
You're only as
good as your word.

32:08.168 --> 32:10.032
I made it through one night
without any funny business.

32:10.068 --> 32:12.062
I think I can make
it through 30 more.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.470
(Travis laughs)

32:14.505 --> 32:15.271
What?

32:16.610 --> 32:17.840
- Well, you did give me a.

32:17.875 --> 32:20.078
- I did not give you a handy.

32:20.113 --> 32:23.582
I have no interest in
touching your dick ever again.

32:23.617 --> 32:25.075
- Oh, oh.
- Okay, got it?

32:25.111 --> 32:26.145
- Okay, okay.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.583
You're getting a little aggro.

32:27.618 --> 32:28.820
- Oh, what?

32:28.855 --> 32:29.815
Do women with emotions
make you scared?

32:29.850 --> 32:31.021
- Uh-uh.

32:31.056 --> 32:32.424
- You wait till I'm
on my period, okay?

32:32.459 --> 32:33.991
I might stab you.

32:34.026 --> 32:36.088
- Sorry, I thought this
would be a fun idea.

32:36.124 --> 32:37.794
- [Abby] Well, it wasn't.

32:37.829 --> 32:39.563
- How about we just go to sleep?

32:39.598 --> 32:41.093
- Yeah, you think?

32:41.129 --> 32:43.002
Give me this, I want that.

32:43.966 --> 32:45.736

when I found it.

34:38.246 --> 34:39.277
- Oh, you're fucking worthless.

34:39.313 --> 34:40.982
Just hand me a seven-16th.

34:41.018 --> 34:42.118
- Hey, I'm not your bitch.

34:42.153 --> 34:43.647
- And you're a
pretty little bitch.

34:43.683 --> 34:45.149
- [Tyler] Call me
a bitch again, huh?

34:45.185 --> 34:46.183
- Bitch, bitch.

34:46.219 --> 34:46.953
- Hey, dipshits.

34:46.988 --> 34:47.723
(hand claps)

34:47.759 --> 34:48.352
We got company.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.125
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, my.

34:50.161 --> 34:52.631
Baby bro is bringing
home a girl.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.231
- Guys, this is Abby.

34:54.267 --> 34:56.566
Abby, these are the moron
twins, Tyler and Taylor.

34:56.601 --> 34:57.328
- Hi.

34:57.363 --> 34:59.066
- Fraternal, obviously.

34:59.101 --> 35:00.968
- And we're not morons.

35:01.004 --> 35:02.238
Travis is the moron.

35:02.274 --> 35:04.201
- Can you guys not act
like assholes just yet?

35:04.236 --> 35:05.505
- [Both] Oh.

35:05.541 --> 35:07.405
- Brother's mouthing off
in front of his woman.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.739
You're a big guy, aren't you?

35:08.775 --> 35:10.374
- Yeah, you're the big
man on campus, right?

35:10.410 --> 35:11.749
- Doesn't make any sense.

35:11.785 --> 35:13.111
- Well, this makes sense.

35:13.147 --> 35:13.913
(Travis groans)

35:13.948 --> 35:14.716
- Oh.

35:14.752 --> 35:15.720
- Taylor!

35:15.755 --> 35:17.723
- [Taylor] Cobra kai!

35:17.758 --> 35:18.655
- [Travis] Get back, Taylor.

35:18.691 --> 35:20.318
- So immature.

35:20.354 --> 35:22.493
Oh, you're Abigail, right?

35:22.528 --> 35:23.287
- Mm-hm.

35:23.323 --> 35:25.095
- I'm, uh, Trenton.

35:25.130 --> 35:27.092
The most attractive
Maddox brother.

35:27.128 --> 35:28.363
- [Abby] Hey.

35:28.399 --> 35:29.126
- Has anyone ever told
you you have the most.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.335
- No!

35:30.371 --> 35:31.265
No.

35:31.301 --> 35:34.331
- Ladies, not in
front of my bike.

35:34.367 --> 35:35.640
Take it in the ring.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.075
- [Boys] Yes, sir.

35:37.110 --> 35:38.269
- Put my tools back
where you found them.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.409
- [Boys] Yes, sir.

35:40.174 --> 35:42.313
- Hey, I'm Jeff.

35:43.649 --> 35:44.616
- I'm Abby.

35:44.652 --> 35:46.079
- Nice to meet you.

35:46.114 --> 35:47.347
- [Abby] You too.

35:47.383 --> 35:48.179
- Come on inside.
- [Abby] Thanks.

35:48.215 --> 35:51.523
(boys grunting)

35:51.559 --> 35:52.422
- So, uh, Abby,

35:54.326 --> 35:56.795
have you ever experienced
the deliciousness

35:56.830 --> 35:58.461
of fried chicken from Kentucky?

35:58.496 --> 36:00.763
- [Tyler] Moron, not every
chicken is from Kentucky.

36:00.799 --> 36:02.100
- Yeah, it is.

36:02.136 --> 36:02.998
That's why they call it
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

36:03.033 --> 36:03.964
- What's going on here?

36:04.000 --> 36:04.767
Are you serious?

36:04.802 --> 36:06.036
You're back.

36:06.072 --> 36:06.999
- What's up, boys?
- [Trenton] Yo.

36:07.034 --> 36:07.937
- Hey.

36:07.973 --> 36:08.871
- Dude, hey, you made it.

36:08.906 --> 36:09.841
- What's going on?

36:09.876 --> 36:11.241
- Hey, sorry, uh, work ran late.

36:11.276 --> 36:13.043
All right, you must
be, um, is it Abby?

36:13.079 --> 36:14.943
- Yeah, and you're
Thomas, right?

36:14.978 --> 36:16.213
You're the oldest.

36:16.248 --> 36:17.875
- I see Travis warned
you about us, huh?

36:17.911 --> 36:19.377
- [Taylor] Riveting
conversation, let's dig in.

36:19.412 --> 36:20.177
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.484
- Grace.

36:23.754 --> 36:24.586
Travis.

36:28.125 --> 36:30.295
- (sighs) Oh, Heavenly Father.

36:30.330 --> 36:33.395
Thank you for the food,
for we remember the hungry.

36:33.430 --> 36:35.459
Please look after our
dear mother, Diane.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.195
May she rest in peace.

36:37.231 --> 36:37.964
- [All] Amen.

36:38.000 --> 36:38.934
- Give me.

36:38.970 --> 36:39.904
- Can we?
- Okay.

36:39.939 --> 36:41.035
- Is this all drumsticks, Dad?

36:41.070 --> 36:42.303
- I want breasts,

36:42.339 --> 36:43.437
I want breasts.
- I want breasts.

36:43.472 --> 36:44.436
- Guys, guys, there's
a lady present.

36:44.471 --> 36:45.972
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

36:46.008 --> 36:47.241
- Oh, wow.

36:47.276 --> 36:48.176
- They're being nice today.

36:48.211 --> 36:49.144
Those are some good pieces.

36:49.179 --> 36:50.709
- Really sweet, thank you, guys.

36:50.744 --> 36:52.912
- Uh, I don't wanna
rain on Travis's parade,

36:52.947 --> 36:55.416
but my shift starts at 10, so
let's get down to business.

36:55.451 --> 36:57.155
- [Taylor] 10, God.
- That's like.

36:57.191 --> 36:58.750
- I'm just saying if you
wanna play, let's play.

36:58.785 --> 37:01.252
- I'm gonna have to
whoop your butt fast.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.827
- Oh, yeah.

37:02.863 --> 37:04.322
I-I can carry some stuff.

37:04.357 --> 37:07.464
(brother humming)

37:12.835 --> 37:15.573
- All right, the name of the
game is Texas hold 'em, Abby,

37:15.608 --> 37:16.500
you in?

37:16.535 --> 37:18.510
- Oh, that's not for me.

37:18.545 --> 37:19.743
Drinks?

37:19.779 --> 37:21.377
- [Boys] Yeah.

37:21.412 --> 37:23.544
- Beer for me and
there's chips up there

37:23.579 --> 37:25.213
and there's dip and
there's like you know,

37:25.248 --> 37:26.376
just whatever you can carry.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.646
- [Abby] Okay.

37:27.682 --> 37:28.620
- Deal, deal, deal,
deal, deal, deal.

37:28.655 --> 37:29.580
- Let's go.

37:29.615 --> 37:30.822
- [Thomas] Let me get the chip.

37:30.857 --> 37:31.950
- [Trenton] Got nothing.

37:33.088 --> 37:33.919
- Eat shit.

37:35.758 --> 37:38.763
Straight on the river and
he does it again, boys.

37:38.798 --> 37:39.490
(boys chattering)

37:39.525 --> 37:40.791
- Are you kidding me?

37:40.827 --> 37:42.326
- Abby, you've been
watching a while.

37:42.362 --> 37:43.360
You wanna join?

37:43.396 --> 37:44.361
- Oh, I'm okay.

37:44.397 --> 37:45.698
- Don't worry.

37:45.733 --> 37:47.639
We take it easy on
the ladies over here.

37:47.675 --> 37:48.501
(Abby chuckles)

37:48.537 --> 37:49.701
- We can play Go
Fish if you like.

37:49.736 --> 37:51.242
- You know, I
actually don't think

37:51.278 --> 37:52.374
it's a question of you
guys going easy on me.

37:52.409 --> 37:53.537
I actually think
it's a question of me

37:53.572 --> 37:55.339
going easy on you guys.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.414
- [Boys] Oh.

37:57.412 --> 37:59.376
- Okay, you're being serious.

37:59.412 --> 38:00.179
- [Abby] Mm-hm.

38:00.215 --> 38:00.948
- [Jeff] Okay.

38:00.983 --> 38:01.815
- Okay.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.450
- Abby, you might
not wanna do that.

38:04.485 --> 38:06.051
Taylor may look like an idiot,

38:06.086 --> 38:08.286
but he happens to be one of
the best poker players in town.

38:08.322 --> 38:10.420
- Oh, in town.

38:10.456 --> 38:11.594
- In the county.

38:12.866 --> 38:14.098
- Oh, wow, the county.

38:14.134 --> 38:15.634
- [Tyler] He's
even played on TV.

38:15.669 --> 38:17.796
- Oh, on TV.

38:17.831 --> 38:19.767
That's pretty
impressive, I don't know.

38:21.302 --> 38:24.002
(cards flipping)

38:25.712 --> 38:26.710
Let's go.

38:26.745 --> 38:27.511
- Okay.

38:28.716 --> 38:31.350
(intense music)

38:36.120 --> 38:38.616
Fold, beginner's luck.

38:38.651 --> 38:40.620
- This is no beginner's luck.

38:40.656 --> 38:42.559
- Well, I never said
I was a beginner.

38:44.092 --> 38:44.891
Call.

38:45.764 --> 38:49.393
- Flash.

38:49.429 --> 38:50.768
- Pair of aces.

38:50.804 --> 38:52.131
- [Twins] Yes!

38:52.166 --> 38:53.435
- Yes!

38:53.471 --> 38:55.269
- [Twins] Da, da,
da, da, da, da, da.

38:55.304 --> 38:56.972
- Aces and eights, boys.

38:57.008 --> 38:58.568
- Don't tell me!

38:58.604 --> 39:00.437
That's a full house.

39:00.473 --> 39:01.740
- Yes, it is.

39:01.775 --> 39:03.613
- You just got
hustled, bro. (laughs)

39:03.648 --> 39:06.684
- Well, no, it's only
hustling if I keep your money.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.478
- Oh.

39:07.513 --> 39:08.745
- Oh, no, no, no.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.957
Sweetheart, that money's yours.

39:11.992 --> 39:13.757
You won it fair and square.

39:13.792 --> 39:14.619
- Shit.

39:14.654 --> 39:17.190
- Where did you learn to play?

39:17.226 --> 39:18.597
- [Abby] Home.

39:18.632 --> 39:19.728
- Home?

39:20.900 --> 39:21.763
Where was that?

39:22.702 --> 39:23.765
- Vegas.

39:24.596 --> 39:25.800
My dad taught me.

39:27.035 --> 39:30.035
- Used to be a high-stakes
poker player named Abernathy.

39:31.774 --> 39:34.339
I remember hearing stories
about him in Vegas.

39:34.375 --> 39:35.277
- What happened?

39:35.312 --> 39:37.674
- Uh, he had this daughter.

39:37.710 --> 39:39.011
Went with him everywhere.

39:40.286 --> 39:41.548
I think the mom
walked out on him

39:41.584 --> 39:43.015
so he was raising
her on his own.

39:44.391 --> 39:45.754
- [Mick] Your eyes even
when you're shuffling.

39:45.789 --> 39:46.750
- [Jeff] While she was way
too young to play legally

39:46.786 --> 39:50.721
but man, she was
a poker prodigy.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.827
As she got better, he got worse.

39:53.829 --> 39:57.269
So she was left bailing
him out even as a kid.

39:57.304 --> 39:58.998
- [Mick] Look your
opponent in the eyes.

40:00.533 --> 40:02.106
- I remember this.

40:02.141 --> 40:03.940
They called her Lucky Charms.

40:03.975 --> 40:05.442
- Lucky 13.

40:05.477 --> 40:07.771
Abby, you must have
heard of her, right?

40:07.806 --> 40:09.712
She must be about your age.

40:12.145 --> 40:17.151
After all, this is you
in the article, isn't it?

40:17.187 --> 40:19.821
(intense music)

40:24.029 --> 40:25.057
- You're Lucky 13?

40:26.597 --> 40:28.559
- [Tyler] We just got
hustled by Lucky 13?

40:28.594 --> 40:29.626
- No fucking way.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.229
- Guys, I'm sorry.

40:31.264 --> 40:33.435
I wasn't trying to hustle you
guys or anything, I swear.

40:33.471 --> 40:36.136
I'm.
- Lucky 13's in this house?

40:36.171 --> 40:37.273
- Yeah.

40:37.308 --> 40:39.604
- [Twins] Lucky 13 in the house!

40:39.639 --> 40:40.905
- Lucky 13 in the house.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.113
- Abby, can I get
a photo with you?

40:42.148 --> 40:43.178
- No, guys, it wasn't really.

40:43.213 --> 40:44.480
- Guys, guys, hey.

40:44.516 --> 40:45.512
You're acting like
a bunch of fangirls.

40:45.547 --> 40:46.313
- [Tyler] Get out of my way.

40:46.349 --> 40:47.082
- You're a fangirl.

40:47.118 --> 40:47.711
- She beat me.

40:47.746 --> 40:48.479
You're a fangirl, move!

40:48.515 --> 40:49.754
(Jeff laughs)

40:49.789 --> 40:50.816
Shut up!

40:50.852 --> 40:51.688
Get your ugly ass
face out of the way!

41:58.355 --> 41:59.451
- That is bullshit.

41:59.487 --> 42:00.255
- I don't know.

42:00.290 --> 42:01.491
- Bitch, you know.

42:01.526 --> 42:02.786
- Okay, yeah,
look, I will admit.

42:02.822 --> 42:03.922
His physique is appealing.

42:03.957 --> 42:06.023
- (chuckles) His
physique is appealing?

42:06.058 --> 42:08.631
- Yes, his physique
is appealing.

42:08.666 --> 42:09.860
But I've learned not
to court excitement

42:09.895 --> 42:11.194
for the sake of excitement.

42:11.230 --> 42:14.035
I mean, truthfully, he
seems a little crazy.

42:14.070 --> 42:17.975
And we both know that the last
thing I need is more crazy.

42:18.011 --> 42:18.970
- Absolutely.

Ugh.

my side of the bed.

- Yeah, just about.

42:53.145 --> 42:53.870
You need any help?

42:53.906 --> 42:55.009

gonna clip your toenails in bed.

- You hear, or you eavesdropped?

43:11.693 --> 43:13.129
That was between Mer and I.

private conversation.

43:16.068 --> 43:17.196
- That hurt.

43:17.231 --> 43:18.628
- Well, it serves you right
for eavesdrop (snorts).

43:18.664 --> 43:20.504

43:20.540 --> 43:21.602
What did I just get
out of you there?

43:21.637 --> 43:22.503

Oh, you are a snort.

I didn't realize this.
- Mm, I'm not ticklish.

43:29.676 --> 43:30.743

You loved it.

You want to hear how I
really feel about you, Abby?

47:33.424 --> 47:34.991
(cat hisses)

47:35.027 --> 47:37.124

know in this house.

cat, Rumpleteazer.

isn't this Tabby?

a collar right there.

- Hey, bud.

47:55.748 --> 47:57.311
- The hell are you
still doing here?

47:59.214 --> 48:01.551

worried about you.

48:01.586 --> 48:03.351
- (laughs) That's rich.

48:03.386 --> 48:06.257
Shouldn't you be worried about
your boyfriend or something?

48:06.293 --> 48:07.588
- My boyfriend?

48:07.624 --> 48:09.992
- Yeah, Mick.

48:10.028 --> 48:12.991
That's right, I saw the
text on your computer.

48:13.026 --> 48:14.291
Very nice, very nice.

48:18.636 --> 48:20.097
(scoffs) What a joke.

48:20.133 --> 48:22.941
- Travis, Mick is my dad.

48:24.209 --> 48:26.437
And how often are you going
through my text messages?

48:26.472 --> 48:31.510
- "Can I come see
you?" would make sense.

48:31.946 --> 48:33.284
So it was your dad?

48:33.320 --> 48:35.285
(Travis laughs)

48:35.320 --> 48:36.817
No way.

48:36.852 --> 48:38.154
That's terrible of me.

48:38.954 --> 48:40.684
Well, I misinterpreted that.

48:41.988 --> 48:42.686
That's great news.

48:43.826 --> 48:45.662
- Is it great news?

48:45.697 --> 48:47.161
Travis, you invaded my privacy

48:47.196 --> 48:49.926
and then you turned
around and ghosted me.

48:49.961 --> 48:50.830
Goodbye.

48:50.866 --> 48:51.800
- Abby, wait, wait.

48:51.835 --> 48:53.571
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48:53.606 --> 48:55.904
I-I was jealous, I messed up.

48:55.940 --> 48:57.734
- No, Travis, you
didn't mess up.

48:57.769 --> 49:00.806
If anything, you just showed
me who you really are.

49:00.842 --> 49:02.238

49:02.274 --> 49:03.644
- Abby, wait, can we talk?

49:03.680 --> 49:04.645

49:04.681 --> 49:05.811

49:05.847 --> 49:06.911
- [Travis] Hey.

49:20.598 --> 49:23.595
(crowd chattering)

49:31.338 --> 49:32.808
- [Parker] Did
anyone ever tell you

49:32.843 --> 49:35.643
that you're a very cute sleeper?

49:35.679 --> 49:37.545
- Hi, Parker.

49:37.580 --> 49:39.142
- Hi.

49:39.177 --> 49:40.716
Is Travis nearby?

49:40.751 --> 49:41.648
Do I need to be worried?

49:41.684 --> 49:43.454
- Ugh, no.

49:43.490 --> 49:44.951
- It's been a while.

49:44.986 --> 49:46.753
How-how have you been?

49:46.789 --> 49:47.685
- Pretty shitty.

49:48.988 --> 49:50.193
- Postmates?

49:50.827 --> 49:52.063
- I would love that.

49:54.064 --> 49:56.230
- So, I spent most
of fifth grade

49:56.266 --> 49:59.068
with a broken leg that
they had to reset twice.

49:59.103 --> 50:01.367
So I got to know the
doctors pretty well,

50:01.402 --> 50:03.035
and realized that's
what I wanted to do

50:03.071 --> 50:04.875
with the rest of my life.

50:04.910 --> 50:06.577
- What kind of doctor
do you wanna be?

50:06.612 --> 50:07.637
- Pediatric medicine.

50:07.673 --> 50:09.372
- Right, yeah, of
course, because it's you.

50:09.408 --> 50:11.916
- Anyway, that's
enough about me.

50:11.951 --> 50:13.711
- What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

50:14.579 --> 50:16.114
- I'm still trying
to figure it out.

50:16.149 --> 50:19.183

50:22.154 --> 50:23.859
Really good ramen.

50:23.894 --> 50:25.858
- Do you wanna get out of here?

50:25.894 --> 50:28.699
- Yes, yes, yes.

50:28.734 --> 50:31.833
I'm saying yes a lot, but yes.

50:31.868 --> 50:33.137
- It is right up here.

50:34.502 --> 50:36.874
- [Abby] We're not gonna
a show again, are we?

50:36.910 --> 50:37.903
- I would not make
that mistake again.

50:37.939 --> 50:39.542
(Abby chuckles)

50:39.578 --> 50:40.511
(door creaks)

50:40.547 --> 50:42.043
Right through here.

50:42.079 --> 50:44.075
- [Abby] Why is it
so dark in here?

50:44.110 --> 50:46.317
- [All] Surprise!

50:46.352 --> 50:47.211
- Whoo.

50:47.246 --> 50:48.144
All right, everybody.

50:48.180 --> 50:49.145
Get some drinks.

50:49.181 --> 50:50.214
Get some shots.

50:50.249 --> 50:51.554
Happy birthday, Abby.

50:51.589 --> 50:52.387
- Thank you.

50:53.420 --> 50:54.292
- [Shepley] Hey,
are you surprised?

50:54.327 --> 50:55.019
- Yeah.

50:55.054 --> 50:56.825
- Touchdown.

50:56.860 --> 50:58.662
And, uh, nice work, doc.

50:58.697 --> 50:59.995
- Were you in on this?

51:00.031 --> 51:01.831
- Uh, only for the
last 10 minutes.

51:01.866 --> 51:03.194
Shepley put out an APB for you.

51:03.230 --> 51:05.436
- Babe, success, success.

51:05.472 --> 51:06.902
Take some shots.

51:06.937 --> 51:08.270
Told you this would work out,

51:08.306 --> 51:09.307
did I not, I said it.
- You did, you really did.

51:09.342 --> 51:10.834
Yeah.

51:10.869 --> 51:13.004
- I'm gonna grab us a
drink and I will take this.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.912
- Oh, thank you.

51:14.947 --> 51:16.809
- How are you, birthday pal?
- Hi.

51:16.845 --> 51:17.680
Thank you.

51:17.716 --> 51:18.911
- Isn't this great?

51:18.947 --> 51:20.849
- Yeah, yeah.

51:20.885 --> 51:22.112
Who are all these people?

51:22.148 --> 51:23.786
- Mm, no idea.

51:23.822 --> 51:25.088
Travis got it in his head

51:25.124 --> 51:26.320
that this was the only
way to say he was sorry

51:26.355 --> 51:28.960
and then Shepley got
like really excited and,

51:28.995 --> 51:30.590
and I couldn't talk
them off the ledge.

51:32.026 --> 51:33.128
- There he is.

51:33.163 --> 51:35.091
I should probably
go talk to Travis.

51:35.126 --> 51:36.534
- Yeah.

51:36.569 --> 51:37.234
Bye, little bird.

51:38.230 --> 51:41.131
(keg tapping)

51:41.166 --> 51:43.204
- You busy?

51:43.239 --> 51:46.476
- Hey, it's the
almost birthday girl.

51:46.512 --> 51:47.978
Surprised?

51:48.014 --> 51:49.680
- Yeah, surprised is
an understatement.

51:49.716 --> 51:51.682
You even recruited Parker.

51:51.717 --> 51:53.184
- Well, he found you.

51:54.419 --> 51:56.814
I should have known that you
guys would be hanging out.

51:57.822 --> 51:58.849
- Well, I can trust him.

52:00.393 --> 52:00.917
- Cool.

52:02.527 --> 52:03.260
- Cool.

52:07.161 --> 52:08.324
Um, well, I'm gonna.

52:08.359 --> 52:10.060
- Yeah, have fun.

52:10.095 --> 52:10.927
- Yeah.

52:13.066 --> 52:13.798
- You okay?

52:14.671 --> 52:15.503
- No.

52:16.775 --> 52:17.835
I need to get fucked up.

52:19.405 --> 52:21.210
- I can make that happen.

52:21.245 --> 52:25.383
- [Crowd] Shot, shot,
shot, shot, shot.

52:25.418 --> 52:26.978
- Whoo!

52:27.013 --> 52:27.812
- Ooh!

52:28.820 --> 52:30.548
- Oh, two.
- Oh.

52:30.583 --> 52:33.149
- Shoot, oh, all right.
- Damn, girl.

52:33.184 --> 52:34.120
- Whoo!

52:34.156 --> 52:35.556
- It's that kind of night.

52:37.155 --> 52:38.088
Oh.

52:38.123 --> 52:39.530
- Oh.

52:39.565 --> 52:40.124
- Slow down.

52:40.160 --> 52:41.061
- I'm so sorry.

52:41.097 --> 52:41.828
The line was interminable.

52:41.863 --> 52:43.162
- Oh.

52:43.198 --> 52:44.900
- I got, I got us merlots.

52:44.935 --> 52:46.063
- Parker, concentrating.

52:46.098 --> 52:48.564
- Uh.

52:48.599 --> 52:49.632
- Why are you so good at this?

52:49.668 --> 52:51.269
- I'll be over
there on the sofa.

52:51.305 --> 52:52.301
- You played this before.

52:52.337 --> 52:53.743
You played this.

52:53.779 --> 52:56.808
(electro-pop music)

53:08.592 --> 53:10.721
- If you look at the health
care system under Obamacare,

53:10.756 --> 53:14.027
we are obviously on
a collision course.

53:14.062 --> 53:16.064
I know, it's bad.

53:16.099 --> 53:20.599
(electro-pop music continues)

53:20.634 --> 53:22.970
Oh, come on.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

53:23.005 --> 53:24.102
Abby, Abby, Abby.

53:24.138 --> 53:25.234
- You're good.

53:25.270 --> 53:26.310
He's got.

53:28.012 --> 53:31.645
(electro-pop music continues)

53:36.855 --> 53:38.520
- No, I don't want kids!

53:38.555 --> 53:40.858
- What do you, what do you
mean you don't want kids?

53:40.893 --> 53:42.518
It's.
- I don't want kids.

53:42.553 --> 53:43.419
I don't wanna.
- Why?

53:43.454 --> 53:44.454
I never knew this.

53:44.489 --> 53:46.489
- I don't want any kids.

53:46.524 --> 53:47.963
- I want like five kids.

53:47.998 --> 53:49.194
- Five kids?
- Yes.

53:49.229 --> 53:50.493
I want Ted Junior.

53:50.528 --> 53:51.998
- Don't, who is Ted One?

53:52.033 --> 53:53.334
- Millicent.

53:53.369 --> 53:55.431
- I'm not a baby factory.
- This is,

53:55.467 --> 53:56.700
this is like whole.

53:56.736 --> 53:58.370
- And I'm not naming
my kid Millicent.

53:58.405 --> 53:59.635
- This is the point of life.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.946
- (screams) I hate Millicent.

54:02.981 --> 54:04.376
- [Shepley] Well, I hate you.

54:04.411 --> 54:05.716
- [America] I hate you more.

54:05.751 --> 54:07.046
(Shepley sobbing)

54:07.082 --> 54:08.616
- Are you okay?

54:09.621 --> 54:10.687
- No.

54:10.723 --> 54:11.982
No, it's over.

54:12.985 --> 54:15.689
I'm never giving my heart
to anyone ever again.

54:15.957 --> 54:16.859
- No!

54:16.895 --> 54:17.993
No, don't say that.

54:18.028 --> 54:19.658
You just need to dance.

54:19.693 --> 54:21.391
You just need to dance
your troubles away.

54:21.426 --> 54:23.059
Just do what I do.

54:25.164 --> 54:26.969
Oh, hi.

54:27.004 --> 54:28.534
- Babe, I am so sorry.

54:28.570 --> 54:30.039
I don't know why I
said that out there.

54:30.074 --> 54:31.903
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

54:34.675 --> 54:36.109
Do you wanna go
and make have make up sex?

54:36.144 --> 54:37.474
- Yes, right now?

54:37.509 --> 54:39.948
Yeah, let's go.
- Okay.

54:39.983 --> 54:41.616
- [Abby] Have fun.

54:44.423 --> 54:46.319
- This has been great,
I'm gonna get out of here.

54:46.354 --> 54:49.453
- No, come on, dance with me.

54:49.489 --> 54:50.586
- I'm-I'm not in the mood.

54:50.622 --> 54:53.191
- Oh, come on, loosen up.

54:53.226 --> 54:54.423
Oh, I know.

54:54.459 --> 54:56.667
I'm twerking.

54:56.703 --> 54:57.429
- [Parker] Uh.

54:57.464 --> 54:58.264
- The boys like the twerking.

54:58.299 --> 54:59.500
- No, no, you're not.

54:59.535 --> 55:00.736
No, this is, uh, yeah.
- This is twerking.

55:00.772 --> 55:01.531
Twerking.

55:01.566 --> 55:02.799
- Yeah, yeah, it's good.

55:02.834 --> 55:04.700
- Come on, have
fun, you're not fun.

55:04.735 --> 55:07.578
Come on, loosen up, have fun.

55:07.613 --> 55:08.406
Come on.

55:08.441 --> 55:09.710
- He's in the back room.

55:10.441 --> 55:11.714
- Excuse me.

55:11.750 --> 55:12.543
- Travis?

55:12.578 --> 55:14.578
The guy you're looking for.

55:14.613 --> 55:16.013
- No, I came here with you.

55:18.250 --> 55:19.120
- Wow!

55:19.156 --> 55:20.287
Oh, you actually recoiled.

55:20.322 --> 55:22.288
- You just caught me off guard.

55:22.324 --> 55:23.589
- Be honest with yourself

55:23.625 --> 55:25.830
and see this thing
through with Travis.

55:25.865 --> 55:27.229
- He's not good for me.

55:27.265 --> 55:28.828
- You keep telling
yourself that.

55:36.006 --> 55:37.466
- Hello, hello.

55:37.502 --> 55:38.541
Okay, thank you.

55:40.839 --> 55:43.607
- Hey, what the
fuck are you doing?

55:43.642 --> 55:44.742
You heard of alcohol poisoning?

55:44.777 --> 55:46.477
You hit double
digits an hour ago.

55:46.513 --> 55:48.346
- What are you, counting?

55:48.381 --> 55:49.580
- Yeah, actually.

55:49.615 --> 55:50.621
You've had enough for tonight.

55:50.656 --> 55:51.683
- No.

55:51.718 --> 55:52.987
- Have you got
anything to eat today?

55:53.022 --> 55:54.385
- Yes, soup.

55:54.420 --> 55:56.018
- Soup?
- Soup.

55:56.053 --> 55:58.421
- Okay, well, that's
gonna end badly for you.

55:58.457 --> 55:59.663
Stop drinking.

55:59.698 --> 56:00.823
- No.

56:00.859 --> 56:02.426
- [Travis] You're
beyond stubborn.

56:02.461 --> 56:03.862
- Oh, I'm so sorry

56:03.898 --> 56:06.095
I'm not one of your
subservient little wenches.

56:06.131 --> 56:07.498
- Do you know how hard
this was to put together?

56:07.533 --> 56:08.898
I did all this for you.

56:08.933 --> 56:11.701
- I didn't ask you
to do any of this.

56:11.736 --> 56:14.573
- I-I know, that's the point.

56:14.609 --> 56:16.739
I did it because
I care about you.

56:16.774 --> 56:18.615
- Well, Travis, you're too late.

56:18.650 --> 56:22.013
Tomorrow the bet's over, and
you never have to see me again.

56:24.549 --> 56:25.588
- [Travis] Shit.

56:26.418 --> 56:27.187
Abby, wait.

56:27.222 --> 56:27.956
- [Abby] Go away!

56:27.992 --> 56:29.057
- Stand still.

56:29.092 --> 56:30.520
I, you're a mess.

56:30.556 --> 56:31.289
Why are you running?

56:31.325 --> 56:32.460
- You're a mess.

56:32.495 --> 56:33.224
- I'm faster than you.
- No, no, no.

56:33.259 --> 56:34.523
- Abby!

56:34.559 --> 56:36.064
- Get off, no!

56:36.100 --> 56:37.365
- Okay, okay, okay.

56:37.401 --> 56:39.536
- You know, you
are such a coward.

56:39.571 --> 56:41.234
You're such a coward.
- You're not making any sense.

56:41.269 --> 56:42.698
- No, you're not.

56:42.734 --> 56:44.536
You just run away from me.

56:44.571 --> 56:47.104
Rather than ask me who Mick was.

56:47.139 --> 56:50.239
You just-you just run away
and then you just throw me

56:50.274 --> 56:54.548
this really big surprise
birthday party for my birthday.

56:54.583 --> 56:55.778
And you think it's
all gonna be okay

56:55.813 --> 56:57.485
where I don't even know anybody.

56:57.521 --> 56:59.950
And then you just
ignore me all night.

56:59.985 --> 57:02.758
And you think I'm just
gonna forgive you?

57:02.793 --> 57:06.891
Because you throw me this really
big surprise birthday party

57:06.927 --> 57:09.692
for my birthday where
I don't know anybody.

57:09.727 --> 57:11.464
- You said that already.

57:11.499 --> 57:12.836
- Stop telling me what to do!

57:12.872 --> 57:14.500
- Okay, okay.

57:14.536 --> 57:17.705
First off, I did
apologize to you

57:17.741 --> 57:19.672
and I tried to have a
conversation with you too.

57:19.708 --> 57:21.475
But you ran off to
the fucking library

57:21.511 --> 57:23.512
only to show up
later with Parker

57:23.547 --> 57:25.713
and then proceed to
get beyond fucked up.

57:25.749 --> 57:28.582
So, pidge, you're gonna
have to walk away from me

57:28.617 --> 57:30.114
because I can't
walk away from you.

57:38.557 --> 57:40.226
(vomits splashes)

57:40.262 --> 57:42.524
(gentle music)

57:42.560 --> 57:43.693
Beautiful.

57:43.729 --> 57:45.096
- When did I have noodles?

57:47.566 --> 57:50.666
(Abby coughing)

57:50.701 --> 57:51.641
I think I'm done.

57:53.539 --> 57:54.910
(both groaning)

57:54.945 --> 57:55.945
- Okay.

57:55.980 --> 57:56.739
- Oh, sorry.

57:56.774 --> 57:58.379
- Oh, you're all right.

57:58.414 --> 58:00.476
Well, I sure hope you're done.

58:00.511 --> 58:02.853
I'm not sure if you
have anything left
in there to throw up.

58:02.889 --> 58:05.583
(both laughs)

58:05.619 --> 58:08.119
- Hey, you wanna make out?

58:10.028 --> 58:11.089
- Not really, no.

58:12.094 --> 58:13.061
I don't.

58:13.097 --> 58:14.895
(Abby laughs)

58:14.930 --> 58:17.064
You know what the best
part about this is, pigeon?

58:17.099 --> 58:18.534
- Hm.

58:18.569 --> 58:20.166
- You're not gonna
remember any of this.

58:20.202 --> 58:21.002
- I'm not?

58:21.037 --> 58:22.573
- No.

58:22.608 --> 58:26.302
So when I tell you that
I'm madly in love with you.

58:27.376 --> 58:28.271
- I won't remember.

58:30.280 --> 58:31.582
- But I really mean it.

58:32.411 --> 58:33.309
- Hm.

58:34.084 --> 58:35.684
(Abby gasps)

58:35.720 --> 58:38.054
Do you wanna go to
International House of Pancakes

58:38.089 --> 58:39.120
and get pancakes?

58:39.156 --> 58:40.087
(Travis gasps)

58:40.122 --> 58:40.891
Yeah?

58:40.927 --> 58:42.118
You wanna go?

58:42.154 --> 58:43.526
I love pancakes.
- Oh, man, what a great idea.

58:43.561 --> 58:44.992
I'm gonna get you up.
- Do you wanna go?

58:45.027 --> 58:46.030
- I'm gonna stand you up.
- Oh, I wanna go to pancakes.

58:46.065 --> 58:47.056
Okay, I want pancakes.

58:47.091 --> 58:48.894
- I got you a clean
shirt instead,

58:48.930 --> 58:51.195
I'll be back.
- Thank you, that's very nice.

58:51.562 --> 58:53.137
- Um.

58:53.172 --> 58:56.073
- I'm a monster. (chuckles)

58:56.108 --> 58:57.536
- Okay, let me help you.

58:57.571 --> 58:58.438
- I'm stuck out here.

58:58.473 --> 58:59.770
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

58:59.806 --> 59:01.538
- Okay, there we
go, put this on.

59:01.574 --> 59:02.580
- Turn around.

59:03.982 --> 59:05.410
I'm decent.

59:05.446 --> 59:06.447
Just kidding.

59:06.483 --> 59:08.483
(Abby laughs)
- Oh, my God.

59:08.519 --> 59:09.417
- I got you.
- Put your shirt on.

59:09.452 --> 59:11.153
- I got you.
- Put it on.

59:11.189 --> 59:11.954
- I'm putting it on.

59:11.989 --> 59:12.650
- Okay.

59:12.686 --> 59:14.353
- Okay, it's on. (laughs)

59:14.389 --> 59:15.157
- Oh, my God.

59:15.192 --> 59:16.257
Oh, I can't trust.

59:16.292 --> 59:18.128
- I got you again.

59:18.163 --> 59:18.888
- You did, you got me,

59:18.923 --> 59:20.594
and I really wanna look again,

59:20.630 --> 59:21.826
but you should
put your shirt on.

59:21.862 --> 59:23.367
- I'm a little
prankster tonight.

59:23.402 --> 59:25.831
- You are very
silly, I'll say that.

59:25.867 --> 59:28.768
Okay, you did it,
I'm so proud of you.

59:28.803 --> 59:30.472
I'm gonna get you
some water, okay?

59:30.508 --> 59:31.336
I'll be back.
- That's so nice.

59:31.372 --> 59:32.640
Thank you,

59:32.676 --> 59:33.772
you're really nice.
- I'm very sweet.

59:33.807 --> 59:35.506
- Thanks.
- Who's your daddy?

59:35.541 --> 59:38.110
(door thuds)

59:40.448 --> 59:42.579
(crowd screaming)

59:42.615 --> 59:45.582
(phone ringing)

59:45.617 --> 59:46.855
- Hey, baby.

59:47.619 --> 59:49.289
- Hi, Mick.

59:49.325 --> 59:50.720
- How are you?

59:50.756 --> 59:52.793
- It's my birthday.

59:52.828 --> 59:55.496
I was just wondering
if you were gonna call.

59:55.531 --> 59:56.959
- I know it's your birthday.

59:56.994 --> 59:58.896
I, uh, I wanted to come see you

59:58.932 --> 1:00:01.034
but I have no idea
where you are.

1:00:02.133 --> 1:00:05.038
- [Abby] I'm in
college in Sacramento.

1:00:06.475 --> 1:00:07.242
- [Mick] How's college?

1:00:07.277 --> 1:00:08.011
How are you doing?

1:00:08.046 --> 1:00:08.877
- I'm good.

1:00:09.641 --> 1:00:10.774
I'm good.

1:00:10.810 --> 1:00:11.877
- I haven't talked to you

1:00:11.912 --> 1:00:14.718
and I-I-I really
miss talking to you.

1:00:15.615 --> 1:00:16.581
- [Travis] Pidge?

1:00:16.617 --> 1:00:17.550
- Oh, I have to go.

1:00:17.585 --> 1:00:21.685
I love you, Dad, bye.

1:00:21.721 --> 1:00:24.860
(car engine revving)

1:00:32.764 --> 1:00:34.465
What time is it?

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:35.468
- One.

1:00:35.504 --> 1:00:36.734
- In the afternoon?

1:00:36.769 --> 1:00:38.869
How am I not hung over?

1:00:38.905 --> 1:00:40.973
- Well, I forced
a liter of water

1:00:41.008 --> 1:00:41.871
down your throat along
with two ibuprofens

1:00:41.907 --> 1:00:43.642
before you went to sleep.

1:00:43.677 --> 1:00:45.714
(Abby chuckles)
What?

1:00:45.749 --> 1:00:47.977
- It's just that one
night, you're drunk.

1:00:48.012 --> 1:00:50.017
Then the next night, I'm drunk.

1:00:51.722 --> 1:00:53.757
- Yeah, we're not
really in sync, are we?

1:00:54.886 --> 1:00:56.386
- We're like a disaster.

1:00:59.460 --> 1:01:00.225
- You know,

1:01:01.666 --> 1:01:02.794
just thinking we can
kick this birthday off

1:01:02.829 --> 1:01:04.762
with some breakfast in bed.

1:01:04.797 --> 1:01:06.865
- I would love a coffee.

1:01:06.900 --> 1:01:08.706
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

1:01:14.475 --> 1:01:17.044
(sniffs) Oh.

1:01:19.183 --> 1:01:21.312
(Abby sighs)

1:01:25.818 --> 1:01:26.749
(footsteps tapping)

1:01:26.785 --> 1:01:28.621
(door creaks)

1:01:28.656 --> 1:01:29.620
- [Travis] Here you go.

1:01:29.655 --> 1:01:31.056
- Thank you.

1:01:31.092 --> 1:01:33.993
You know I was thinking
since it's my birthday

1:01:34.028 --> 1:01:35.993
and our last night
together as roommates

1:01:36.029 --> 1:01:39.330
that maybe we do
something special.

1:01:40.834 --> 1:01:42.098
- What do you have in mind?

1:01:42.134 --> 1:01:44.137
- Let's look in
the magic drawer.

1:01:48.510 --> 1:01:49.373
A foot massage.

1:01:51.811 --> 1:01:52.849
- Anything you want.

1:01:53.647 --> 1:01:56.149
(gentle music)

1:02:00.225 --> 1:02:01.123
(Abby groans)

1:02:01.159 --> 1:02:01.985
Too much?

1:02:02.020 --> 1:02:03.160
- No, it's good, it's good.

1:02:03.195 --> 1:02:04.721
It's really good.

1:02:04.756 --> 1:02:05.689
Do it again.

1:02:05.725 --> 1:02:06.492
(Abby groaning)

1:02:06.527 --> 1:02:07.691
Okay, okay.

1:02:07.727 --> 1:02:08.461
Maybe lighter.

1:02:08.497 --> 1:02:09.830
Maybe lighter,

1:02:09.866 --> 1:02:11.101
lighter, lighter.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1:02:11.136 --> 1:02:12.532
(Abby sighs)

1:02:12.567 --> 1:02:14.368
- Yeah. (chuckles)

1:02:14.403 --> 1:02:15.234
That's good.

1:02:17.376 --> 1:02:19.441
My calf's kind of hurting.

1:02:19.476 --> 1:02:20.638
- And you want me to?

1:02:20.674 --> 1:02:21.878
- Yes, please.

1:02:23.808 --> 1:02:25.777
(Abby moans)

1:02:25.812 --> 1:02:28.147
Yeah, that feels good.

1:02:28.183 --> 1:02:32.350
- Is there anyone else do
you want me to massage?

1:02:33.487 --> 1:02:34.319
- Here.

1:02:38.394 --> 1:02:40.557
(Abby moans)

1:02:40.593 --> 1:02:41.392
And,

1:02:44.367 --> 1:02:45.665

1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:52.334

1:03:52.370 --> 1:03:53.629
I got impatient.

1:03:55.406 --> 1:03:57.173

1:03:57.209 --> 1:03:58.007
- Uh-huh.

1:03:59.211 --> 1:04:00.009
Is it in?

1:04:00.839 --> 1:04:01.607

1:04:06.285 --> 1:04:09.585
(Abby chuckles)

1:04:09.620 --> 1:04:11.988

1:04:35.874 --> 1:04:37.879
(lips smack)

1:04:37.914 --> 1:04:41.009
- Well, you've
exhausted me officially.

1:04:41.045 --> 1:04:41.980
(Abby giggling)

1:04:42.015 --> 1:04:43.045
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:44.553
Good night, Abby.

1:04:44.588 --> 1:04:46.421
- Good night, Travis.

1:04:46.457 --> 1:04:49.058

1:05:02.033 --> 1:05:04.634
(intense music)

1:05:07.278 --> 1:05:08.509
- Abby?

1:05:08.545 --> 1:05:10.379
Abby Abernathy.

1:05:10.415 --> 1:05:10.973
Good morning.

1:05:11.009 --> 1:05:12.546
- Good morning.

1:05:12.582 --> 1:05:13.308
Can I help you?

1:05:13.343 --> 1:05:15.510
- Uh, this might sound weird,

1:05:15.546 --> 1:05:17.647
but I'm gonna need
you to come with me.

1:05:19.022 --> 1:05:21.150
- Yeah, no, that's
not going to happen.

1:05:21.186 --> 1:05:22.586
- What if I asked nicely?

1:05:23.659 --> 1:05:24.588
- Have a nice day.

1:05:25.729 --> 1:05:27.195
- [Vince] It's about your dad.

1:05:31.732 --> 1:05:32.632
- My dad?

1:05:32.668 --> 1:05:33.498
- [Vince] Yeah.

1:05:34.802 --> 1:05:36.104
- What about him?

1:05:36.140 --> 1:05:38.635
- [Vince] He's placing
bad bets and owes my boss.

1:05:38.671 --> 1:05:41.476
They're gonna break his legs
if you don't come with me.

1:05:41.512 --> 1:05:44.113

1:06:18.714 --> 1:06:21.183
(phone beeps)

1:06:25.182 --> 1:06:26.450
- What?
- Hey.

1:06:26.485 --> 1:06:27.788
- There you guys are,
where have you been?

1:06:27.823 --> 1:06:28.588
- What's going on, man?

1:06:28.624 --> 1:06:29.218
Just geez.

1:06:29.253 --> 1:06:30.861
- Abby's disappeared.

1:06:30.896 --> 1:06:32.828
Now help me look for
a clue or anything.

1:06:32.864 --> 1:06:34.428
- First of all,
don't yell at me.

1:06:34.463 --> 1:06:35.927
Second of all, there's a lot
about Abby that you don't know.

1:06:35.963 --> 1:06:37.227
- I know everything.

1:06:37.262 --> 1:06:38.729
I know that she's Lucky 13,

1:06:38.764 --> 1:06:42.938
and now I know that she packed
her mattress full of money.

1:06:42.973 --> 1:06:44.635
- Hang on, I'm
tracking her location.

1:06:46.743 --> 1:06:48.003
She's headed to Vegas.

1:06:48.038 --> 1:06:48.808
- Vegas?

1:06:48.843 --> 1:06:50.240
- This isn't good.

1:06:50.275 --> 1:06:52.010
Wait, hey, that's my phone!

1:06:52.046 --> 1:06:53.745
- Buy yourself a new one.

- Dick.

Hey, Mick.

- (clears throat) I'm sorry.

1:07:10.933 --> 1:07:12.635
- How much do you owe Benny?

1:07:12.671 --> 1:07:14.166
- [Mick] A hundred grand.

1:07:14.202 --> 1:07:15.869
- $100,000, Dad?
- I know, I know.

1:07:15.905 --> 1:07:17.104

this stuff, I swear.

Isn't that what they say, Mick?

1:07:26.110 --> 1:07:27.150
Hello, Abby.

1:07:28.487 --> 1:07:29.683
How's your game?

1:07:29.719 --> 1:07:31.151
- I'm retired.

1:07:31.186 --> 1:07:34.817
- Oh, Abigail, anonymous
college student.

1:07:36.290 --> 1:07:39.129
Well, uh, for your
father's sake,

1:07:39.164 --> 1:07:42.792
I hope it's a short time
because he owes me 100 grand

1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:44.961
by midnight tonight.

1:07:44.997 --> 1:07:46.266
- Come on.

1:07:46.302 --> 1:07:47.670
Your own dad wouldn't
even lend him any money.

1:07:47.706 --> 1:07:49.302
You know he has a problem.

1:07:49.337 --> 1:07:52.306
- Unlike my father,
may he rest in peace,

1:07:52.342 --> 1:07:54.208
I'm not running a daycare,
I'm running a business.

1:07:54.243 --> 1:07:57.275
- Well, 100 grand by
tonight is impossible.

1:07:57.311 --> 1:07:58.407
- We both know,
with your talent,

1:07:58.442 --> 1:07:59.942
you can make that in a day.

1:07:59.977 --> 1:08:03.380
I used to watch you win 30
grand in 30 minutes underground.

1:08:03.416 --> 1:08:05.620
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1:08:05.656 --> 1:08:06.782
- I'm underage.

1:08:06.818 --> 1:08:09.025
- If I get caught, I have
to drop out of college.

1:08:09.060 --> 1:08:10.388
- You've lived here
long enough, kiddo.

1:08:10.423 --> 1:08:12.294
You know how to
avoid getting caught.

1:08:13.694 --> 1:08:15.691
- There has to be another
way that we can handle this.

1:08:15.727 --> 1:08:17.731
- There it is, but
you're not gonna like it.

1:08:17.767 --> 1:08:18.568
(fingers snaps)

1:08:18.603 --> 1:08:20.203
- [Abby] Hey, hey!

1:08:20.239 --> 1:08:24.104
- No, no, no, no, please no!
- I'll do it, I'll do it!

1:08:24.140 --> 1:08:25.837
- Good to see you
again, Abigail.

1:08:25.872 --> 1:08:27.238
Mick.

1:08:27.273 --> 1:08:30.073
Hey, enough with the buffet.

1:08:30.109 --> 1:08:31.681
Get her a room.

1:08:31.717 --> 1:08:33.515
Leave her the fuck alone.

1:08:33.551 --> 1:08:34.211
Let's go.

1:08:34.247 --> 1:08:35.685
Come on, take the top off.

1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:36.412
What are you doing here?

1:08:36.447 --> 1:08:40.289
(motorcycle engine revving)

1:08:44.794 --> 1:08:47.761
(taser crackling)

1:08:47.797 --> 1:08:50.398
(upbeat music)

1:08:53.836 --> 1:08:56.602
(elevator pings)

1:09:08.785 --> 1:09:11.050
- Wow, wow, wow.

1:09:11.086 --> 1:09:12.614
- Did you do what I asked?

1:09:12.650 --> 1:09:14.554
- Yeah, just like
you instructed.

1:09:16.323 --> 1:09:17.488
Are you sure you
wanna stay here?

1:09:17.523 --> 1:09:18.960
There are bigger
whales at the Bellagio.

1:09:18.995 --> 1:09:20.259
- They'll recognize me there.

1:09:20.295 --> 1:09:21.897
I'm trying to stay
under the radar.

1:09:21.932 --> 1:09:23.261
- Anything else, Your Majesty?

1:09:23.296 --> 1:09:24.999
- Yeah, give the waitress 200

1:09:25.034 --> 1:09:26.695
to start watering down my drinks

1:09:26.731 --> 1:09:28.802
and go wait outside
until I call you.

1:09:28.838 --> 1:09:29.971
- You got it.

1:09:30.006 --> 1:09:33.674
(motorcycle engine revving)

1:09:33.709 --> 1:09:34.910
- Hey.

1:09:34.945 --> 1:09:36.844
Are you guys playing poker?

1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:38.746
- No, it's roulette.

1:09:38.782 --> 1:09:41.350
(Abby groaning)

1:09:42.813 --> 1:09:44.820
- There's a minimum
buy-in of five grand.

1:09:44.855 --> 1:09:47.857
- Ooh, okay, Lion King.

1:09:47.892 --> 1:09:49.221
- Look at you, you look nice.

1:09:49.256 --> 1:09:50.819
But this is a high-stakes room.

1:09:50.854 --> 1:09:53.095
Do yourself a favor and
go to the main floor

1:09:53.130 --> 1:09:54.657
and pick out a
shiny slot machine.

1:09:54.692 --> 1:09:56.659
- I can't go back
to the main floor.

1:09:56.695 --> 1:09:58.529
You see, I'm at this
bachelorette party

1:09:58.564 --> 1:10:01.338
and Cheryl invited
this twat, Terry,

1:10:01.373 --> 1:10:04.671
who hates me because Lyle
finger-banged me on Halloween,

1:10:04.706 --> 1:10:07.842
which in my defense I thought
that they were separated.

1:10:07.878 --> 1:10:09.139
Where's my vibrator?

1:10:09.175 --> 1:10:10.140
- [Players] Huh?

1:10:10.176 --> 1:10:12.645
(upbeat music)

1:10:15.282 --> 1:10:17.749
- Psst, is this a good hand?

1:10:20.586 --> 1:10:22.721
What's up with the
silent treatment?

1:10:25.895 --> 1:10:28.628
(chips clattering)

1:10:33.467 --> 1:10:36.673
Hey, Cliff, I like
your tiger shirt.

1:10:36.708 --> 1:10:37.707
Or is it cheetah?

1:10:37.743 --> 1:10:38.873
- Can you be quiet?

1:10:38.908 --> 1:10:39.808
- Can I be quiet?

1:10:39.843 --> 1:10:41.437
Can you be quiet?

1:10:41.472 --> 1:10:42.972
I'm as quiet as a mouse.

1:10:44.782 --> 1:10:45.548
Asshole, say what?

1:10:45.583 --> 1:10:46.549
- What?

1:10:46.585 --> 1:10:48.013
- Exactly.

1:10:48.049 --> 1:10:50.952
(upbeat music)

1:10:50.988 --> 1:10:52.347
I've got two black cards.

1:10:52.383 --> 1:10:53.450
Is that good?

1:10:53.485 --> 1:10:56.285
- You gotta show your hand.

1:10:56.320 --> 1:10:57.294
- The cards!

1:11:01.592 --> 1:11:02.797
- You gotta be kidding me.

1:11:02.833 --> 1:11:03.927
- Hey, Cliff.

1:11:12.610 --> 1:11:13.442
Rawr.

1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:17.006
(upbeat music)

1:11:21.649 --> 1:11:25.151
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
meet up with my peeps.

1:11:25.186 --> 1:11:26.923
It's been real, fellas.

1:11:26.958 --> 1:11:28.952
And like my dad used to say,

1:11:28.987 --> 1:11:32.092
if you can't spot the chump
in the first 30 seconds,

1:11:32.127 --> 1:11:33.088
then you're the chump.

1:11:34.962 --> 1:11:35.794
Bye.

1:11:37.703 --> 1:11:40.029
(phone beeps)

1:11:47.108 --> 1:11:48.270
(crowd chattering)

1:11:48.305 --> 1:11:49.038
- Ma'am?

1:11:51.443 --> 1:11:52.976
You in the blue dress?

1:11:54.047 --> 1:11:54.846
Stop.

1:11:57.986 --> 1:11:58.984
I gotcha.

1:11:59.019 --> 1:12:00.088
- Jesse.

1:12:00.123 --> 1:12:01.483
- I totally got you.
- Hi.

1:12:01.519 --> 1:12:02.792
- [Jesse] Come here.

1:12:02.828 --> 1:12:04.289
- Oh, you scared me.

1:12:04.324 --> 1:12:05.122
- [Jesse] I bet I did.

1:12:05.157 --> 1:12:06.426
- Yeah.

1:12:06.461 --> 1:12:07.422
- [Jesse] Jesus,
you look fantastic.

1:12:07.457 --> 1:12:08.631
- Thank you.

1:12:08.667 --> 1:12:09.192
So do you.

1:12:09.228 --> 1:12:10.031
- Thanks.

1:12:10.066 --> 1:12:11.426
Yeah, security, right?

1:12:11.462 --> 1:12:12.730
- [Abby] Great.

1:12:12.766 --> 1:12:14.002
- Man, I knew I should
have asked you to prom.

1:12:14.037 --> 1:12:15.337
- Right?
- For real.

1:12:15.373 --> 1:12:17.532
- Um, well, I have a, I
have a thing to get to.

1:12:17.567 --> 1:12:18.808
- Oh, yeah, right.

1:12:18.843 --> 1:12:19.975
- Can I call you?

1:12:20.011 --> 1:12:21.174
- Yeah, I would love that.

1:12:21.209 --> 1:12:22.275
I have the same number.

1:12:22.310 --> 1:12:23.539
- Yeah, I'll give you a call.

1:12:23.574 --> 1:12:24.779
We'll hang out later.

1:12:24.815 --> 1:12:26.178
- Awesome.

1:12:26.214 --> 1:12:27.309
Just one more thing.

1:12:27.344 --> 1:12:28.746
- Yeah?

1:12:28.781 --> 1:12:31.347
- I'm gonna need you
to give me these chips.

1:12:31.382 --> 1:12:32.480
- Excuse me?

1:12:32.516 --> 1:12:34.383
- Come on, Abby.

1:12:34.419 --> 1:12:35.721
You're underage.

1:12:35.757 --> 1:12:36.759
You know you can't gamble
when you're underage.

1:12:36.795 --> 1:12:37.721
It's illegal.

1:12:37.757 --> 1:12:38.758
I don't wanna see
you get in trouble.

1:12:40.293 --> 1:12:41.061
- Jesse, please.

1:12:41.097 --> 1:12:42.799
I-I need this money.

1:12:42.834 --> 1:12:44.267
- This is my job.

1:12:44.302 --> 1:12:46.903
And I would hate to
see you go to jail.

1:12:46.938 --> 1:12:47.930
Abby, give me the chips.

1:12:47.965 --> 1:12:50.099
I'll totally cover you
with my boss, okay?

1:12:51.269 --> 1:12:52.604
Call me.

1:12:52.639 --> 1:12:57.678
(footsteps tapping)
(intense music)

1:13:03.118 --> 1:13:04.346
(phone ringing)

1:13:04.381 --> 1:13:05.151
- Hey.

1:13:05.187 --> 1:13:05.987
- [Abby] It's Abby.

1:13:06.023 --> 1:13:07.017
Are you at the club?

1:13:08.322 --> 1:13:09.253
- Why, are you okay?

1:13:09.289 --> 1:13:10.658
- I got caught.

1:13:11.663 --> 1:13:12.422
- What?

1:13:12.458 --> 1:13:14.028
- Listen to me, Dad.

1:13:14.064 --> 1:13:14.797
Get out of the club.

1:13:14.833 --> 1:13:15.525
Get out of town.

1:13:15.561 --> 1:13:16.825
Don't use your cell phone.

1:13:16.861 --> 1:13:18.092
Don't use any of
your credit cards

1:13:18.128 --> 1:13:20.100
and text me when you get
a burner phone, okay?

1:13:20.136 --> 1:13:20.965
We'll figure it out.

1:13:22.306 --> 1:13:23.136
- [Mick] I guess
I'll leave tonight.

1:13:23.172 --> 1:13:24.368
I'll hike to Denver.

1:13:24.404 --> 1:13:26.402
- I'm so sorry, Dad.

1:13:26.438 --> 1:13:27.510
I let you down.

1:13:34.017 --> 1:13:35.083
- You called me.

1:13:35.119 --> 1:13:35.885
You said you had my money.

1:13:35.921 --> 1:13:37.178
- I had your money,

1:13:37.214 --> 1:13:39.385
and then it was taken
from me by Jesse Viveros.

1:13:39.420 --> 1:13:40.820
- And that is my problem how?

1:13:41.893 --> 1:13:43.521
Where's Mick?

1:13:43.556 --> 1:13:45.088
- He's gone, but we'll find him.

1:13:47.296 --> 1:13:50.764
(motorcycle engine revving)

1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:54.333
- Just go find Jesse.

1:13:54.368 --> 1:13:55.668
Jesse has your money.

1:13:55.703 --> 1:13:58.774
- I'm not a charity,
and I don't run errands.

1:13:58.809 --> 1:13:59.974
- Shit.

1:14:00.010 --> 1:14:00.774
- You know what?

1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:04.580
Abby, I like you.

1:14:05.542 --> 1:14:06.681
You're nice.

1:14:07.314 --> 1:14:09.678
So why don't you?

1:14:09.713 --> 1:14:11.150
- What are you doing?

1:14:11.186 --> 1:14:12.484
- Oh, I'm gay.

1:14:12.519 --> 1:14:14.117
Trust me, you're not my type.

1:14:15.492 --> 1:14:18.590
I will sponsor all of
your entrance fees.

1:14:18.626 --> 1:14:20.794
The legal age in
California is 18,

1:14:21.959 --> 1:14:23.894
and we'll split
the profits 50-50.

1:14:23.930 --> 1:14:25.662
- Well, I don't wanna
play poker for a living.

1:14:25.697 --> 1:14:27.433
I just wanna go to college.

1:14:27.468 --> 1:14:29.531
- I'm offering you a compromise.

1:14:29.567 --> 1:14:31.038
(door thudding)

1:14:31.074 --> 1:14:31.973
- [Travis] Abby!

1:14:32.008 --> 1:14:33.406
(door slams)

1:14:33.441 --> 1:14:35.278
- What the fuck?
- Travis?

1:14:35.313 --> 1:14:36.610
- [Benny] Security.
- Are you okay?

1:14:36.645 --> 1:14:38.442
- Hey, you got to
leave right now, okay?

1:14:38.477 --> 1:14:41.279
(punches thudding)

1:14:41.314 --> 1:14:43.385
(body thuds)

1:14:43.420 --> 1:14:45.350
(Dane speaking in
foreign language)

1:14:45.385 --> 1:14:46.382
(clothes ripping)

1:14:46.417 --> 1:14:47.351
- What?

1:14:47.387 --> 1:14:50.156
(lively music)

1:14:50.192 --> 1:14:52.826
(both grunting)

1:14:54.295 --> 1:14:55.626
(monitor clatters)

1:14:55.662 --> 1:15:00.702
(both grunting)
(fists thudding)

1:15:02.566 --> 1:15:03.573
- Travis?

1:15:08.507 --> 1:15:10.708
- That's your one.

1:15:10.744 --> 1:15:11.540
(Dane speaks in
foreign language)

1:15:11.576 --> 1:15:14.650
(both grunting)

1:15:20.056 --> 1:15:21.517
(head thuds)

1:15:21.552 --> 1:15:24.025
(fist thuds)

1:15:24.060 --> 1:15:26.357
(body thuds)

1:15:26.393 --> 1:15:27.828
- You're good.

1:15:30.632 --> 1:15:32.230
- Taxi.
- [Passerby] Call me, bro.

1:15:32.266 --> 1:15:33.462
- Pigeon?

1:15:33.497 --> 1:15:34.769
Pigeon?

1:15:35.436 --> 1:15:36.466
Where are you going?

1:15:36.502 --> 1:15:37.907
What the heck?

1:15:37.943 --> 1:15:39.173
(elevator pings)

1:15:39.209 --> 1:15:40.106
- Don't talk to me.

1:15:40.141 --> 1:15:40.702
- Why?

1:15:40.738 --> 1:15:42.341
Where are we going?

1:15:42.377 --> 1:15:43.572
Will you talk to me?

1:15:43.607 --> 1:15:45.144
Abby, stop!

1:15:45.179 --> 1:15:46.411
- What?

1:15:46.446 --> 1:15:47.916
What do you want?

1:15:47.951 --> 1:15:49.113
- I, uh.

1:15:50.455 --> 1:15:52.915
- Do you have any idea
what you just did?

1:15:52.951 --> 1:15:54.555
- I wasn't gonna
let them hurt you.

1:15:54.590 --> 1:15:56.621
- They weren't hurting
me, I was fine.

1:15:56.656 --> 1:15:58.260
I was handling it on my own.

1:15:58.295 --> 1:15:59.593
- How am I supposed to know

1:15:59.628 --> 1:16:01.729
when you keep
everything a secret?

1:16:01.765 --> 1:16:05.368
I had to track you down
to a strip club in Vegas.

1:16:05.403 --> 1:16:06.532
One day you're
dressed like a nun,

1:16:06.567 --> 1:16:07.400
and then you're wearing this.

1:16:07.435 --> 1:16:08.233
Who the hell are you?

1:16:08.268 --> 1:16:09.468
- God.

1:16:09.503 --> 1:16:10.871
- [Travis] I love you.

1:16:12.604 --> 1:16:14.439
- You love me?

1:16:14.474 --> 1:16:15.209
You don't know me.

1:16:15.244 --> 1:16:16.778
- That's not true.

1:16:16.813 --> 1:16:20.678
Whatever you're going
through, we can figure it out.

1:16:20.713 --> 1:16:22.311
- I don't wanna figure it out.

1:16:23.113 --> 1:16:24.748
I've had enough
crazy in my life.

1:16:24.783 --> 1:16:26.684
I don't want any more crazy.

1:16:26.719 --> 1:16:29.153
And Travis, you make me crazy!

1:16:33.865 --> 1:16:34.928
Shit!

1:16:37.265 --> 1:16:38.066
(body thud)

1:16:38.102 --> 1:16:40.530
(upbeat music)

1:16:40.566 --> 1:16:43.332
(both moaning)

1:16:49.707 --> 1:16:51.708
(mirror shatters)

1:16:51.743 --> 1:16:52.509
Get it out, get it out.

1:16:52.545 --> 1:16:53.642
- I'm trying.

1:16:53.678 --> 1:16:55.314
(tracker rips)

1:16:55.350 --> 1:16:56.985
- (groans) Shit.

1:16:57.021 --> 1:16:58.185
Come here.

1:16:58.220 --> 1:17:00.551
(Abby moans)

1:17:00.586 --> 1:17:03.957
(glass shattering)

1:17:04.922 --> 1:17:05.687
I'm so horny, I'm so horny.

1:17:05.722 --> 1:17:06.658
- I'll try!

1:17:06.693 --> 1:17:08.360
Okay, I'm trying, I'm trying!

1:17:08.396 --> 1:17:09.163
(Travis thuds)

1:17:09.198 --> 1:17:10.798
- Oh, shit.

1:17:10.834 --> 1:17:12.628
- [Man] Hey, what the fuck
is going on over there?

1:17:12.664 --> 1:17:13.764
- Get these off.

1:17:13.799 --> 1:17:14.999
What's wrong with your button?

1:17:15.034 --> 1:17:16.764
- Hey, keep it down,
we're trying to sleep.

1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:17.568
(Abby groans)

1:17:17.603 --> 1:17:18.571
- Oh, oh, my gosh.

1:17:18.606 --> 1:17:19.405
I'm so sorry, you all right?

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:20.840
I-I-I just needed

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:21.705
to take off my shoe.
- It's okay, come here.

1:17:21.740 --> 1:17:23.476
(cabinet thud)
Aw.

1:17:23.512 --> 1:17:24.574
- [Man] Hey, knock it off!

1:17:24.610 --> 1:17:25.576
(lamp shatters)

1:17:25.611 --> 1:17:26.812
- [Travis] Jesus.

1:17:26.847 --> 1:17:27.511
- [Woman] What's
going on over there?

1:17:27.547 --> 1:17:28.780
(phone ringing)

1:17:28.816 --> 1:17:33.252
(cabinet clanking
and clattering)

1:17:33.287 --> 1:17:33.982
- No.

1:17:34.017 --> 1:17:34.883
(mirror thuds and shatters)

1:17:34.919 --> 1:17:35.817
(phone ringing continues)

1:17:35.852 --> 1:17:37.320
Go back.
- Yeah.

1:17:40.197 --> 1:17:41.459
(water splashing)

1:17:41.494 --> 1:17:42.430
(Abby gasps)

1:17:42.465 --> 1:17:44.199
(sink crashing)
(cat meows)

1:17:44.234 --> 1:17:45.429
- Oh, no, in here.

1:17:45.464 --> 1:17:47.102
- Yeah.

1:17:47.138 --> 1:17:49.599
(door banging)

1:17:49.635 --> 1:17:50.666
- Take this off.

1:17:50.702 --> 1:17:51.941
Help me get it.

1:17:51.976 --> 1:17:52.571
- Yeah.

1:17:52.606 --> 1:17:53.637
(shower knob squeaks)

1:17:53.672 --> 1:17:55.803
(water splashing)

1:17:55.839 --> 1:17:56.804
(Abby giggles)

1:17:56.840 --> 1:17:59.914
(siren wailing)

1:18:05.550 --> 1:18:06.382
- No.

1:18:07.521 --> 1:18:08.456
(water splashing)

1:18:08.491 --> 1:18:11.060
(cat meows)
(Abby groaning)

1:18:11.096 --> 1:18:13.763
(clothes rip)

1:18:14.595 --> 1:18:15.527
- Do you mind?
- Okay.

1:18:15.562 --> 1:18:16.529
- Yeah, put it in.

1:18:16.564 --> 1:18:17.732
- I don't think it's in.

1:18:17.767 --> 1:18:18.430
- I-I don't think it's
in, I don't think.

1:18:18.466 --> 1:18:19.067
- It's not in.

1:18:19.102 --> 1:18:20.102
- Ow!

1:18:20.137 --> 1:18:20.895
- Oh, sorry.

1:18:20.930 --> 1:18:22.099
- Ow, okay, okay.

1:18:22.134 --> 1:18:25.500
Yeah, no, hold on,
let's switch, switch.

1:18:29.310 --> 1:18:30.043
- Ow!

1:18:30.908 --> 1:18:33.046
- I can't feel anything.

1:18:34.514 --> 1:18:35.317
- No, no.

1:18:35.352 --> 1:18:36.084
- Let's get out of here.

1:18:36.119 --> 1:18:37.050
- Okay.

1:18:38.915 --> 1:18:40.222
(curtains rattles)

1:18:40.257 --> 1:18:43.056
(phone vibrating)

1:18:50.228 --> 1:18:53.399
- [Benny] Abby, Mick
still owes me 100 grand

1:18:53.435 --> 1:18:55.070
and it's on you.

1:18:55.105 --> 1:18:56.171
Call me.

1:18:56.207 --> 1:18:58.841
(intense music)

1:19:19.857 --> 1:19:21.690
(phone ringing)

1:19:21.725 --> 1:19:22.694
Abby.

1:19:22.730 --> 1:19:25.030
- No, it's her boyfriend.

1:19:25.065 --> 1:19:27.131
Look, I-I know that
she owes you money,

1:19:27.167 --> 1:19:29.437
but I think I have a way
to get it back to you.

1:19:29.472 --> 1:19:30.565
- [Benny] I'm listening.

1:19:32.069 --> 1:19:34.903
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

1:19:34.939 --> 1:19:37.508
(Abby groans softly)

1:19:37.544 --> 1:19:38.309
- Travis?

1:19:51.494 --> 1:19:55.023
(phone message beeps)

1:19:55.058 --> 1:19:58.131
(phone keys clacking)

1:20:02.766 --> 1:20:03.598
What?

1:20:07.906 --> 1:20:09.945
- Pigeon, don't be mad.

1:20:11.042 --> 1:20:12.541
I worked out a deal with Benny.

1:20:12.576 --> 1:20:16.013
I'm gonna fight for him
tonight and settle your debt.

1:20:16.049 --> 1:20:18.215
You and your dad
are off the hook.

1:20:18.250 --> 1:20:19.717
I left a rental car
in the parking garage

1:20:19.753 --> 1:20:21.050
for you to get home.

1:20:21.085 --> 1:20:22.619
I'll be back before you know it.

1:20:22.654 --> 1:20:24.952
- Shit.

1:20:24.988 --> 1:20:26.190
(phone rings)

1:20:26.225 --> 1:20:27.460
- [Travis] It's Travis,
you know what to do.

1:20:27.496 --> 1:20:28.222
(phone beeps)

1:20:28.257 --> 1:20:30.163
- Hey, it's me, call me back.

1:20:30.198 --> 1:20:32.462
You have no idea what
you've gotten yourself into.

1:20:36.067 --> 1:20:38.065
- I see you found my new car.

1:20:38.101 --> 1:20:39.308
Pretty sick, right?

1:20:39.343 --> 1:20:40.305
- Yeah, it's nice.

1:20:42.339 --> 1:20:44.246
Tons of room in
there, I like that.

1:20:44.281 --> 1:20:45.612
- Yeah, man.

1:20:45.648 --> 1:20:46.812
- [Mick] So it went okay?

1:20:46.847 --> 1:20:48.210
- Oh, she told me about it.

1:20:48.246 --> 1:20:50.183
Handed over the
chips, no problem.

1:20:51.316 --> 1:20:54.086
So what do you think
she's gonna do now?

1:20:54.121 --> 1:20:56.321
She gonna start working
for Benny or what?

1:20:57.558 --> 1:20:59.258
- Ah, yeah,

1:20:59.293 --> 1:21:01.626
I don't think she has much
of a choice at this point.

1:21:01.662 --> 1:21:03.261
(Jesse chuckles)

1:21:03.296 --> 1:21:05.660
One of the greatest things
that I ever heard is

1:21:05.695 --> 1:21:09.438
if you don't spot the chump
in the first 30 seconds,

1:21:09.473 --> 1:21:10.368
then you are the chump.

1:21:11.707 --> 1:21:12.938
I, uh, I wanna come see you

1:21:12.974 --> 1:21:15.543
but I have no idea
where you are.

1:21:15.578 --> 1:21:16.638
- [Abby] I'm in college.

1:21:17.944 --> 1:21:19.377
- [Vince] It's about your dad.

1:21:21.084 --> 1:21:25.117
- Mick still owes me 100
grand by midnight tonight.

1:21:25.152 --> 1:21:27.185
- I'm gonna need you
to give me these chips.

1:21:27.221 --> 1:21:29.424
- Get out of the club,
get out of town, okay?

1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:30.752
We'll figure it out.

1:21:30.787 --> 1:21:34.095
- [Mick] I guess I'll leave
tonight, I'll hike to Denver.

1:21:35.228 --> 1:21:38.099
- You know, Abby, she's
looking pretty hot.

1:21:38.134 --> 1:21:39.093
- [Mick] Can you not talk
about my daughter, thanks.

1:21:39.128 --> 1:21:40.161
- No, no, I know.

1:21:40.196 --> 1:21:41.636
I was just like, "Dang."

1:21:41.672 --> 1:21:42.898
(Jesse grunts)
(taser crackles)

1:21:42.933 --> 1:21:44.236
(body thuds)

1:21:44.272 --> 1:21:45.474
- Ho, Abby, what are you.
- You son of a bitch.

1:21:45.509 --> 1:21:46.101
- What are you doing?

1:21:46.136 --> 1:21:47.441
- How's Denver, Mick?

1:21:47.477 --> 1:21:48.473
- What the hell?

1:21:48.509 --> 1:21:49.277
Aw.

1:21:49.312 --> 1:21:50.040
Shit.

1:21:50.075 --> 1:21:50.875
Obviously, I'm not in Denver.

1:21:50.910 --> 1:21:51.711
That's not what I meant.

1:21:51.746 --> 1:21:54.145
I'm going to Den, ow!

1:21:54.180 --> 1:21:56.046
- You have two
seconds to come clean.

1:21:56.081 --> 1:21:57.214
- To come clean about wha-ow!

1:21:57.250 --> 1:22:00.248
- You, Benny, Jesse,
you guys set me up

1:22:00.283 --> 1:22:02.018
from the beginning, didn't you?

1:22:02.053 --> 1:22:03.287
- [Mick] Abby, Abby, I.

1:22:03.322 --> 1:22:04.452
- You don't owe Benny
any fucking money.

1:22:04.488 --> 1:22:05.926
- Look at me, I'm
an old fucking man.

1:22:05.962 --> 1:22:08.160
I can't play as good
as you play, okay?

1:22:08.195 --> 1:22:10.194
And I need money, I
need money to live.

1:22:10.229 --> 1:22:12.834
- Then get a job
like a normal person.

1:22:12.869 --> 1:22:14.632
- I know this doesn't
look good, okay?

1:22:14.668 --> 1:22:15.871
I get it.

1:22:15.906 --> 1:22:18.538
This does not look good.
- Yeah, right, yeah.

1:22:18.574 --> 1:22:19.571
- I love you.

1:22:19.607 --> 1:22:20.376
- Get out.

1:22:20.411 --> 1:22:22.343
Get out!
- Okay.

1:22:22.379 --> 1:22:22.938
- Get out!

1:22:22.974 --> 1:22:23.773
Out of my life.

1:22:23.808 --> 1:22:24.776
Get out!

1:22:24.812 --> 1:22:25.744
- Can I get my bag?

1:22:25.779 --> 1:22:26.876
- [Abby] Get out!

1:22:26.912 --> 1:22:27.711
(tires screech)

1:22:27.746 --> 1:22:28.578
- Abby!

1:22:30.751 --> 1:22:33.850
(upbeat music)

1:22:33.886 --> 1:22:35.419
(crowd cheering)

1:22:35.454 --> 1:22:40.293
(punches and kicks thudding)
(fighter groaning)

1:22:41.025 --> 1:22:42.227
(phone ringing)

1:22:42.262 --> 1:22:42.991
- [Travis] It's Travis,
you know what to do.

1:22:43.027 --> 1:22:44.094
(phone beeps)

1:22:44.129 --> 1:22:44.995
- [Abby] Travis, call me back.

1:22:45.030 --> 1:22:45.931
You don't have to fight.

1:22:45.966 --> 1:22:47.399
No one owes Benny anything.

1:22:49.973 --> 1:22:52.674
- And now, for the
first event this evening

1:22:52.709 --> 1:22:54.404
we have something very special,

1:22:54.439 --> 1:22:57.112
the challenger, Travis
"Mad Dog" Maddox!

1:23:01.551 --> 1:23:03.913
(crowd chattering)

1:23:03.949 --> 1:23:06.349
(crowd booing)

1:23:06.385 --> 1:23:08.417
- Man, when you said
come out to Vegas,

1:23:08.452 --> 1:23:10.026
I thought you
meant the Bellagio.

1:23:10.061 --> 1:23:10.721
- [Man] Hey, I'm gonna fuck
your mother, all right?

1:23:10.756 --> 1:23:11.555
Mad Dog.

1:23:12.727 --> 1:23:13.695
- Thanks, yeah.

1:23:13.730 --> 1:23:16.498
Well, she's dead, so you can't.

1:23:16.533 --> 1:23:19.327
(car engine revs)

1:23:19.363 --> 1:23:20.595
(car door thuds)
(siren blaring)

1:23:20.630 --> 1:23:22.604
- [Woman] The lockdown
is about to begin

1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:25.269
in five, four, three, two.

1:23:25.305 --> 1:23:26.872
- Is there any way
I can (indistinct)?

1:23:26.907 --> 1:23:27.841
- Whore, whore!
- Okay.

1:23:27.876 --> 1:23:29.042
Okay, I'm going, I'm going.

1:23:29.077 --> 1:23:31.641
- And now, the
champion, Chernobyl!

1:23:33.816 --> 1:23:37.647
(crowd cheering and applauding)

1:23:40.657 --> 1:23:42.586
- [Both] What the fuck.

1:23:44.057 --> 1:23:47.728
(crowd cheering and applauding)

1:23:47.763 --> 1:23:49.527
- You're going to die.

1:23:51.094 --> 1:23:51.760
- Thank you.

1:23:54.067 --> 1:23:58.107
(crowd cheering and applauding)

1:24:00.743 --> 1:24:02.238
- Whoever dies, loses.

1:24:02.273 --> 1:24:03.974
- [Crowd] Chernobyl, Chernobyl.

1:24:04.009 --> 1:24:05.076
- How's it going?

1:24:05.111 --> 1:24:07.547
- [Crowd] Chernobyl, Chernobyl.

1:24:07.583 --> 1:24:08.447
- Awesome.

1:24:09.884 --> 1:24:10.946
- Come on, can we go?

1:24:10.981 --> 1:24:11.782
Please.

1:24:11.818 --> 1:24:12.787
- Shut up!

1:24:12.822 --> 1:24:13.819
(man belches)
(Abby sighs)

1:24:13.854 --> 1:24:16.218
(Chernobyl growls)

1:24:16.253 --> 1:24:17.019
- This is gonna suck.

1:24:17.054 --> 1:24:17.857
- Yeah, wow.

1:24:17.892 --> 1:24:20.187
- Let the battle begin.

1:24:20.223 --> 1:24:22.764
(intense music)

1:24:22.799 --> 1:24:25.063
(kicks and punches thudding)

1:24:25.098 --> 1:24:26.193
- [Shepley] Yeah, there you go.

1:24:26.229 --> 1:24:27.361
There you go.

1:24:27.397 --> 1:24:29.204
- Come on!
- Whoo-hoo.

1:24:30.407 --> 1:24:31.506
- What?

1:24:31.542 --> 1:24:33.134
(Travis grunts)

1:24:33.169 --> 1:24:34.168
Stay in it.

1:24:34.204 --> 1:24:36.445
(fists thudding)

1:24:36.481 --> 1:24:38.205
Nice, way to go.

1:24:38.241 --> 1:24:39.379
There you go!

1:24:40.682 --> 1:24:42.917
(fist thuds)

1:24:42.953 --> 1:24:47.816
(Travis groaning)
(crowd cheering)

1:24:48.792 --> 1:24:50.184
- Here, I'll pay for him.

1:24:50.219 --> 1:24:52.186
(man smooch)

1:24:52.221 --> 1:24:53.222
(kick thuds)

1:24:53.257 --> 1:24:54.158
- [Shepley] Nice kick!

1:24:54.193 --> 1:24:56.696
There you go, there you go.

1:24:56.731 --> 1:24:57.765
(kick thuds)

1:24:57.801 --> 1:25:00.569
Nice, give him the combo.

1:25:00.604 --> 1:25:03.201
(Chernobyl grunts)

1:25:03.237 --> 1:25:05.867
- [Chernobyl] No
bitch, Chernobyl.

1:25:06.908 --> 1:25:07.674
- You can't use a chain.

1:25:07.710 --> 1:25:08.837
What is this?

1:25:10.548 --> 1:25:11.105
(Travis grunts)

1:25:11.140 --> 1:25:12.239
- Ref!

1:25:12.275 --> 1:25:13.241
Stop the fight.

1:25:13.276 --> 1:25:16.552
(punches thudding)

1:25:16.587 --> 1:25:17.816
This is bullshit.

1:25:17.852 --> 1:25:19.246
(chains clank)

1:25:19.282 --> 1:25:22.755
(intense music)

1:25:22.790 --> 1:25:24.452
(both grunt)

1:25:24.487 --> 1:25:26.694
Come here, you son of a bitch.

1:25:26.729 --> 1:25:28.522
(punches thudding)

1:25:28.557 --> 1:25:31.427
(heads thud)
(Shepley grunts)

1:25:31.463 --> 1:25:32.468
- [Abby] Can I get
through, please?

1:25:32.503 --> 1:25:33.433
- No, whoa!

1:25:36.333 --> 1:25:37.506
- [Shepley] Oh, shit.

1:25:37.542 --> 1:25:39.868
(Travis grunts)

1:25:41.611 --> 1:25:43.108
(kick thuds)

1:25:43.143 --> 1:25:48.184
That's my boy, man. (groans)

1:25:49.981 --> 1:25:51.212
- Shit.

1:25:51.248 --> 1:25:52.050
(bottle cracks)

1:25:52.085 --> 1:25:54.889
(electricity crackles)

1:25:54.924 --> 1:25:59.756
(kick thuds)
(Shepley groans)

1:26:03.594 --> 1:26:08.699
(Chernobyl growling)
(crowd cheering)

1:26:10.905 --> 1:26:12.234
(flames crackling)

1:26:12.270 --> 1:26:14.576
(Chernobyl growling)

1:26:14.612 --> 1:26:16.578
(chair thuds)

1:26:16.614 --> 1:26:19.347
(crowd shouting)

1:26:20.277 --> 1:26:21.683
- Shit, fire!

1:26:21.718 --> 1:26:22.980
(flames crackling)

1:26:23.016 --> 1:26:23.945
- Fire, fire!

1:26:25.084 --> 1:26:26.048
(flames whooshing)

1:26:26.084 --> 1:26:26.882
- Oh, God!

1:26:29.119 --> 1:26:29.918
- Hey.

1:26:31.825 --> 1:26:32.593
- Abby?

1:26:32.628 --> 1:26:33.460
- Hi.

1:26:36.162 --> 1:26:37.257
- Shepley, come on.

1:26:37.293 --> 1:26:38.500
- Come on.

1:26:38.536 --> 1:26:39.293
- Come on.

1:26:39.329 --> 1:26:41.930
(Shepley groans)

1:26:45.504 --> 1:26:47.473
- I talked to Shepley
and he's fine.

1:26:47.508 --> 1:26:50.338
I'll be on the first
flight to Vegas tomorrow.

1:26:50.374 --> 1:26:51.809
Hey, just a thought,

1:26:51.844 --> 1:26:54.112
but maybe you wanna check
into the Mirage or the Luxor.

1:26:54.148 --> 1:26:55.177
I-I hear they have deals.

1:26:55.212 --> 1:26:56.148
- It's fine.

1:26:56.183 --> 1:26:57.517
Benny's not gonna do anything.

1:26:57.552 --> 1:26:59.882
His scam didn't work out
and no one owes him a dime.

1:27:00.616 --> 1:27:02.820
Mer, you just have to trust me.

1:27:02.856 --> 1:27:03.853
Bye.

1:27:07.859 --> 1:27:10.324
- I don't know if I ever
wanna leave this bed, pigeon.

1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:11.726
- Hey, Travis?

1:27:11.761 --> 1:27:13.694
- Hm?
- Why do you call me pigeon?

1:27:13.730 --> 1:27:15.998
- You don't know
what a pigeon is?

1:27:16.034 --> 1:27:19.002
- Yeah, it's an annoying bird
that craps on people's heads.

1:27:19.037 --> 1:27:20.240
- No.

1:27:20.275 --> 1:27:23.537
It's a dove, an
attractive girl, a.

1:27:23.573 --> 1:27:25.712
- A winning hand in poker.

1:27:25.747 --> 1:27:26.781
- See?

1:27:26.816 --> 1:27:27.481
You're my pigeon.

1:27:29.084 --> 1:27:30.519
- I'm an exhausted pigeon.

1:27:30.554 --> 1:27:31.520
- I bet.

1:27:31.555 --> 1:27:32.618
- You?

1:27:33.586 --> 1:27:35.249
- I'm gonna stay up
for a little while.

1:27:35.284 --> 1:27:36.855
- Oh.

1:27:36.890 --> 1:27:39.894
Are you scared I'm
gonna disappear again
if you go to sleep?

1:27:39.929 --> 1:27:40.989
- It crossed my mind.

1:27:43.261 --> 1:27:43.992
- I love you.

1:27:45.562 --> 1:27:49.305
I love you, Travis Maddox.

1:27:51.775 --> 1:27:52.741
- You love me?

1:27:52.777 --> 1:27:54.002
- It's the tattoos.

1:27:55.505 --> 1:27:56.271
- They're pretty cool.

1:27:56.307 --> 1:27:58.842
(Abby giggles)

1:28:04.019 --> 1:28:05.615
Sure you wanna do this?

1:28:05.650 --> 1:28:08.750
- (scoffs) Dude, I
was born to ride.

1:28:08.786 --> 1:28:10.651
- You got some brain
damage back there.

1:28:10.686 --> 1:28:12.655
- (scoffs) I love you, Mommy.

1:28:12.690 --> 1:28:14.530
Hey, I'll see you
back at the ranch.

1:28:14.565 --> 1:28:15.696
- What?

1:28:15.731 --> 1:28:16.997
- Corn.

1:28:17.032 --> 1:28:18.661
(motorbike engine revs)

1:28:18.696 --> 1:28:20.736
Ah, let's see what
this puppy can do.

1:28:20.771 --> 1:28:22.563
(cans clattering)

1:28:22.598 --> 1:28:23.530
- Is he gonna be okay?

1:28:23.566 --> 1:28:24.639
- [Shepley] Yee-ha!

1:28:24.674 --> 1:28:25.801
- No.

1:28:25.836 --> 1:28:28.170
- [Shepley] I need to
get me one of these.

1:28:28.205 --> 1:28:29.142
Whoo!

1:28:29.177 --> 1:28:29.776
- [Travis] Whose bag is this?

1:28:29.812 --> 1:28:31.179
- Jesse's.

1:28:31.214 --> 1:28:32.576
- Who's Jesse?
- I love this thing.

1:28:32.611 --> 1:28:34.080
- Doesn't matter.
(objects clanking)

1:28:34.116 --> 1:28:35.750
- Does Jesse have a shirt?

1:28:35.785 --> 1:28:36.781
- He might.

1:28:40.220 --> 1:28:41.722
- He does have a shirt.

1:28:41.757 --> 1:28:42.650
- Hey.

1:28:42.685 --> 1:28:44.419
- It's not my favorite style.

1:28:44.454 --> 1:28:45.823
A little loud but.

1:28:54.534 --> 1:28:56.064
He also has a ton
of money in here.

1:28:57.535 --> 1:29:00.368
- Actually, no, that's my money.

1:29:00.404 --> 1:29:02.105
- You won this?

1:29:02.140 --> 1:29:03.242
- Yeah.

1:29:03.277 --> 1:29:04.705
Told you I'm good.
- Yeah.

1:29:04.740 --> 1:29:07.880
So then, this is yours too?

1:29:07.915 --> 1:29:08.884
- Mm-hm.

1:29:08.919 --> 1:29:09.784
- You have great taste.

1:29:09.820 --> 1:29:10.785
(Abby laughs)

1:29:10.821 --> 1:29:11.651
Here's to you.

1:29:14.724 --> 1:29:15.482
Ow.

1:29:15.518 --> 1:29:16.722
- Here's to us.

1:29:19.896 --> 1:29:20.726
- How's my face?

1:29:23.700 --> 1:29:24.763
- Ooh.

1:29:26.332 --> 1:29:28.200
You look better already.

1:29:28.235 --> 1:29:29.537
Vegas for another night?

1:29:30.502 --> 1:29:31.707
- That would be a disaster.

1:29:31.742 --> 1:29:32.837
Let's do it.

1:29:33.636 --> 1:29:36.874
(electro-pop music)

1:29:40.346 --> 1:29:43.716
(electricity crackles)

1:30:04.767 --> 1:30:08.609
(electro-pop music continues)

1:30:34.599 --> 1:30:38.232
(electro-pop music continues)

1:30:46.543 --> 1:30:49.078
(gentle music)

1:31:16.673 --> 1:31:20.010
(gentle music continues)

1:31:39.629 --> 1:31:42.230
(upbeat music)

1:32:09.693 --> 1:32:13.228
(upbeat music continues)

1:32:39.690 --> 1:32:43.225
(upbeat music continues)

1:32:47.565 --> 1:32:50.199
(intense music)

1:33:17.762 --> 1:33:21.164
(intense music continues)

1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:41.822
(gentle music)

1:34:09.945 --> 1:34:13.381
(gentle music continues)

1:34:21.362 --> 1:34:24.095
(gentle music)

1:34:51.723 --> 1:34:55.258
(gentle music continues)
