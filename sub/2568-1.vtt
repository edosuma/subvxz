02:15.743 --> 02:20.789
MARSHLAND

02:35.777 --> 02:40.519
SEPTEMBER 20TH, 1980

03:27.895 --> 03:29.521
We thought you weren't coming.

03:29.522 --> 03:31.883
Our car broke down.

03:34.526 --> 03:36.527
We gave one of the rooms away.

03:36.529 --> 03:38.905
You'll have to share
a room tonight.

03:38.906 --> 03:41.767
Upstairs on the right.
Thanks.

03:52.127 --> 03:54.113
Your new country.

04:05.556 --> 04:09.543
We'll grab dinner and go to bed.
We want to start first thing.

04:11.770 --> 04:13.689
Yeah, I miss you.
A lot.

04:13.690 --> 04:15.549
How are you?

04:16.899 --> 04:18.802
Have you been throwing up?

04:22.866 --> 04:24.516
Sure.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.980
I have to go.
We'll talk tomorrow.

04:31.249 --> 04:34.791
Estrella's the eldest, she's 17.
Carmen is 15, I think.

04:34.793 --> 04:36.501
- Sixteen.
- Hey.

04:36.503 --> 04:38.113
Excuse me.

04:38.505 --> 04:41.464
- Where were they seen last?
- At the edge of town.

04:41.466 --> 04:44.773
Their father runs the ferry at the Point.
They live a couple miles down the road.

04:44.808 --> 04:49.306
They were walking home.
A neighbor saw them get in a car.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.928
- She's the last one who saw them.
- What kind of car?

04:51.963 --> 04:53.719
- A Citroën.
- Model?

04:53.937 --> 04:56.606
A Dyane 6 or a 2CV.
The lady isn't sure.

04:56.641 --> 04:58.464
- How long ago was that?
- Three days.

04:58.664 --> 05:01.284
- Nice marinade. What fish is it?
- Striped mullet.

05:01.319 --> 05:03.250
Never tried it.
Very tasty.

05:04.865 --> 05:06.865
Is this the first time
they've gone missing?

05:06.900 --> 05:09.158
No.
They have a reputation.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.758
- But they were always home by bedtime.
- What for?

05:13.413 --> 05:15.522
A reputation.
You know.

05:15.665 --> 05:17.787
No, I don't.

05:18.377 --> 05:21.589
- They like to have a good time.
- You don't?

05:23.673 --> 05:25.826
A reputation for being easy.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.290
Give me another ten.

05:40.065 --> 05:43.592
Bad time to pick
on the military.

05:47.571 --> 05:50.073
What that fascist said
is antidemocratic.

05:50.075 --> 05:53.077
All I did was write a letter to
the paper. That's not a crime.

05:53.078 --> 05:56.022
This country isn't a democracy.
They're not used to it.

05:56.121 --> 05:59.249
You can't criticize a general
and expect a pat on the back.

05:59.251 --> 06:00.986
The military still has power.

06:01.253 --> 06:03.070
So what do we do?

06:03.421 --> 06:05.280
Leave it like it was?

06:06.299 --> 06:08.257
Look where it got you.

06:08.259 --> 06:10.433
- Yeah, with you.
- No.

06:10.468 --> 06:12.552
I'm not the cop with
a future in Madrid.

06:12.553 --> 06:15.329
For me this isn't a punishment.
I don't want to be a hero.

06:17.101 --> 06:19.961
You'd rather extort money
from hookers and bars.

06:20.228 --> 06:22.857
- Who told you that?
- I have a good ear.

06:23.385 --> 06:26.589
- What else have you heard?
- That's not enough for you?

06:29.363 --> 06:31.889
A bottle of sweet wine
and two glasses.

06:33.742 --> 06:35.517
No, one.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.519
Good night.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.628
What are they drinking?

07:03.395 --> 07:05.381
- Gin.
- Gin?

07:05.857 --> 07:09.138
- Give them another round. Is this enough?
- Plenty.

07:09.651 --> 07:13.529
And a donut or some churros.
Keep them lucid.

07:13.564 --> 07:16.052
- And for you?
- Another beer.

07:16.825 --> 07:18.950
I'd better not mix anymore.

07:18.952 --> 07:20.903
Well, okay.

07:20.938 --> 07:22.855
Give me both.

07:30.028 --> 07:31.730
- What time is it?
- Late.

07:31.925 --> 07:35.108
Get up. They gave us a car
while they fix ours.

07:38.764 --> 07:40.353
FAIR WAGES

07:40.388 --> 07:42.682
I heard last night the
girls wanted to leave town.

07:42.717 --> 07:45.686
- People talk a lot when they drink.
- And go where?

07:45.769 --> 07:47.277
Anywhere.

07:47.312 --> 07:49.852
Their father wasn't
very happy with them.

08:37.570 --> 08:38.929
Rocio.

08:44.325 --> 08:46.017
Give these gentlemen some wine.

08:57.923 --> 08:59.241
Say when.

09:02.428 --> 09:03.661
When.

09:09.767 --> 09:11.502
- For you?
- No, thank you.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.102
Smells good.
What is it?

09:14.137 --> 09:16.230
- River crabs.
- Spicy?

09:20.819 --> 09:23.515
- So what now?
- Which is their bedroom?

09:47.261 --> 09:48.788
May I?

10:07.448 --> 10:10.309
WELCOME TO THE
LABOR MARKET

10:11.660 --> 10:14.436
Any idea where they
may have gone?

10:19.752 --> 10:21.361
Did you argue about anything?

10:29.427 --> 10:31.060
Notice anything missing?

10:31.095 --> 10:35.041
A bankbook, for their savings account.
And clothing.

10:35.350 --> 10:38.211
Do you know why your daughters
wanted to leave?

10:38.729 --> 10:41.089
My daughters didn't want
to go anywhere.

10:42.649 --> 10:44.343
Did anyone want to hurt them?

10:54.911 --> 10:58.855
- Any money, anything valuable?
- Do you know why you're here?

11:00.666 --> 11:03.674
- To find your daughters.
- No one gives a shit about them.

11:03.709 --> 11:06.713
You're here because her cousin
served with Judge Andrade.

11:06.714 --> 11:09.657
So skip the song and dance
and just find them.

11:10.384 --> 11:13.113
- Lunch.
- I'm coming.

11:19.756 --> 11:20.934
I found it in the brazier.

11:20.935 --> 11:24.354
Please don't tell my husband.
If he finds out he'll kill them.

11:24.356 --> 11:27.383
They've already brought him
enough shame.

12:06.896 --> 12:09.524
- Were they with anyone?
- They were alone.

12:09.525 --> 12:12.115
- Did you talk to them?
- They were far away.

12:12.445 --> 12:15.076
- We were with them after that.
- Where?

12:15.362 --> 12:18.407
At the bumper cars for a while,
then we went home.

12:18.408 --> 12:20.205
- What time was it?
- Midnight.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.764
- I know because we had to go.
- Where did you leave them?

12:23.799 --> 12:25.811
On the road.
At the edge of town.

12:25.956 --> 12:28.165
- Did they have boyfriends?
- No.

12:29.043 --> 12:31.003
Is it true they wanted
to leave town?

12:31.004 --> 12:32.879
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.048
- You're lame.
- And you're jealous.

12:35.436 --> 12:36.533
Okay.

12:36.592 --> 12:40.436
- Did they ever say where?
- Anywhere is better than this.

12:41.096 --> 12:44.772
- Any friends with a white car, a Citroën?
- No.

12:47.895 --> 12:49.463
It's Quini.

12:50.022 --> 12:52.858
- What?
- Her boyfriend is outside.

12:55.777 --> 12:57.388
Can we go now?

12:57.446 --> 12:59.221
You can leave.

13:02.743 --> 13:05.286
- Your son?
- The youngest. He's in Germany.

13:05.834 --> 13:09.592
He's been working there for two years.
I have two more in Barcelona...

13:09.624 --> 13:13.206
- ...and my daughter's in France.
- Can you tell me what you saw?

13:13.253 --> 13:16.689
On the bend.
That's where it stopped.

13:16.724 --> 13:19.419
- Did you see how many people were in the car?
- No.

13:19.467 --> 13:22.445
- Were they forced into the car?
- I think they knew each other.

13:22.731 --> 13:25.789
- Because they were laughing.
- I drew a sketch for you.

13:26.349 --> 13:29.935
This one is a 2CV,
with round headlights on the hood.

13:29.970 --> 13:32.186
And the Dyane 6
has them built in.

13:32.187 --> 13:35.049
It was more like this one.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.516
The Dyane 6.

13:37.859 --> 13:41.303
- Who are they?
- Pickers. Here for the harvest.

13:43.366 --> 13:45.767
He's from the town.
They know him.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.953
Could be a picker
who comes every year.

13:47.954 --> 13:50.146
Or someone who works
at the fair.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.123
The father has a Dyane 6.
Yellow.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.775
It was parked outside the house.
Yellow looks like white at night.

13:56.810 --> 14:00.156
- And gray. It's a common car.
- Excuse me.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.824
Someone wants to talk to you.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.580
Angelita is psychic,
she sees stuff.

14:12.615 --> 14:14.686
She talks to the
dead in her sleep.

14:14.688 --> 14:19.425
She asks them what she wants
to know and the dead tell her.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.744
Have a seat.

14:56.686 --> 14:59.855
I've been talking to my dead
mother the last two nights.

14:59.890 --> 15:01.716
And she said...

15:02.107 --> 15:04.969
she saw the girls at the
abandoned farmhouse.

15:16.206 --> 15:19.175
- Something wrong?
- Nothing.

16:05.670 --> 16:10.657
LONG LIVE FRANCO
VICTORY WAS OURS AND ALWAYS WILL BE

16:25.939 --> 16:27.674
Pedro!

16:28.357 --> 16:30.050
Over here!

16:32.112 --> 16:33.679
What's up?

16:48.795 --> 16:50.947
I'll get the car.

16:54.564 --> 16:56.051
I'll see if I can reach it.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.512
I'm almost touching the water.

17:16.155 --> 17:17.430
Careful!

17:19.240 --> 17:20.809
Are you okay?

17:23.369 --> 17:25.438
I got it, pull me up!

17:36.632 --> 17:38.768
Estrella was wearing hose
like those.

18:54.332 --> 18:55.733
Freeze!

18:56.793 --> 18:58.153
Stop!

19:07.971 --> 19:09.705
Why are you running?

19:10.472 --> 19:12.832
- I don't have a permit.
- What is that?

19:12.975 --> 19:15.892
- A baby deer?
- Roebuck.

19:16.733 --> 19:18.790
- Where are you from?
- The town.

19:19.816 --> 19:21.259
Get up.

19:25.530 --> 19:28.250
- What's your name?
- Jesus.

19:28.491 --> 19:31.325
You and I met the other night
at the fair, remember?

19:31.326 --> 19:33.560
My head still hurts
from the gin.

19:34.371 --> 19:37.107
- How did you get here?
- I walked.

19:37.165 --> 19:40.032
- It's along walk.
- Not if you know the trails.

19:40.169 --> 19:42.336
See anyone go in or out
of the farmhouse?

19:42.337 --> 19:45.006
I don't like that place.
Nothing but ghosts around.

19:45.007 --> 19:46.532
Can I go?

19:50.359 --> 19:53.201
- How much do you get for Bambi?
- 250 pesetas a kilo.

19:53.347 --> 19:55.708
Don't sell it, you owe us.

19:55.893 --> 19:58.753
So find someone who knows
how to cook it.

20:00.313 --> 20:02.381
Son of a bitch!

20:02.440 --> 20:04.522
Get out of here or
I'll peg you in the head!

20:04.557 --> 20:07.127
- Find anything?
- No, nothing.

20:07.612 --> 20:09.370
In the well?

20:09.864 --> 20:11.390
Garbage.

20:31.008 --> 20:33.577
Tie up the geese,
I need to take a leak.

20:42.062 --> 20:43.462
Abelardo!

20:43.896 --> 20:45.714
Abelardo, come here!

21:04.124 --> 21:05.567
Carmen.

21:21.725 --> 21:23.250
Estrellla.

21:28.815 --> 21:32.093
Go back to the oar,
I forgot my notebook.

22:00.721 --> 22:02.790
- Where was that?
- Back there.

22:03.473 --> 22:05.474
Then why are you
putting it here?

22:05.475 --> 22:07.392
- With the other stuff.
- What stuff?

22:07.393 --> 22:10.396
The pile. All together
so nothing gets lost.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.105
I'll put it back if you want.

22:12.107 --> 22:14.591
No, leave it there.
Don't touch anything else.

22:20.239 --> 22:23.484
Write this down.
"Apart from the breasts...

22:23.519 --> 22:26.133
"Several cuts,
apparently stab wounds.

22:26.168 --> 22:29.024
First degree burn
on the left hand."

22:30.626 --> 22:32.485
Let's move to the other body.

22:35.670 --> 22:40.050
Write down that she has cuts
across her neck, abdomen and thorax.

22:40.051 --> 22:43.995
Three fingers cut off
on her left hand.

22:49.644 --> 22:53.737
Signs of vaginal injury. She was
probably raped like her sister.

22:54.064 --> 22:55.966
Help me turn her over.

22:58.485 --> 23:00.638
She was forced from behind too.

23:08.494 --> 23:11.897
They have been in the
water for two days.

23:12.331 --> 23:15.108
- Where does this road lead?
- To the river.

23:20.464 --> 23:22.557
- What are those photos for?
- El Caso.

23:22.884 --> 23:24.592
- How did you find out?
- I got a call.

23:24.593 --> 23:26.595
- Who?
- I don't know.

23:26.596 --> 23:28.455
Get out of here.

23:31.559 --> 23:34.227
Weren't you listening?
Get the hell out of here!

23:34.229 --> 23:36.186
I'm leaving, I'm leaving!

23:36.187 --> 23:37.755
Go on.

23:47.950 --> 23:52.119
Handle this discreetly and
solve it as soon as possible.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.496
I promise you'll be rewarded.

23:54.498 --> 23:56.832
The harvest begins soon,
and we can't lose it.

23:56.833 --> 24:00.111
We already have enough
problems with the strike.

24:06.759 --> 24:08.743
Your ticket back to Madrid.

24:10.847 --> 24:13.056
They weren't killed here,
there's no blood.

24:13.057 --> 24:15.433
Someone drove them here
and dumped them.

24:15.791 --> 24:19.845
The tire tracks double back.
He changed his mind and turned around.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.132
Maybe he saw someone
and got nervous.

24:24.777 --> 24:27.990
Someone has to tell the parents.
You're from here, they know you.

24:28.065 --> 24:32.153
You guys do it.
We have to see them every day.

24:35.747 --> 24:37.689
I'll do it.

26:09.629 --> 26:11.821
Let's get a drink.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.419
Thanks.

26:30.983 --> 26:32.566
Excuse me.

26:32.567 --> 26:35.429
This came for you earlier.

26:36.321 --> 26:40.225
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.

27:29.187 --> 27:30.289
What's wrong?

27:30.290 --> 27:33.901
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.

27:44.802 --> 27:46.870
Who are you guys?

27:47.639 --> 27:49.332
We're police.

27:49.474 --> 27:53.069
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.

27:53.104 --> 27:55.629
No, you guys aren't cops.

27:55.688 --> 27:58.608
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.

27:58.609 --> 28:01.442
- Wanna see my badge?
- Stay back.

28:07.534 --> 28:10.521
I'll show you my badge and
you put down the shotgun.

28:17.210 --> 28:18.735
It's not loaded.

28:19.337 --> 28:21.239
I only wanted to talk.

28:21.714 --> 28:23.072
I'm sorry.

28:25.217 --> 28:27.203
Beatriz was my girlfriend.

28:28.096 --> 28:29.955
He killed her.

28:32.724 --> 28:35.085
He killed Adela too.

28:37.062 --> 28:39.939
He chops them up and
dumps them in the river.

28:39.941 --> 28:42.192
That's why they
only found the foot.

28:42.193 --> 28:43.802
What foot?

28:46.238 --> 28:48.222
It was her shoe.

28:48.531 --> 28:51.100
I gave it to her.

28:53.537 --> 28:55.954
She said she was coming back.

28:55.955 --> 28:58.249
Back from where?

28:58.250 --> 29:00.860
The Costa del Sol.

29:01.962 --> 29:04.071
She found a job there.

29:06.299 --> 29:08.327
She loved me.

29:09.176 --> 29:11.953
Nobody commits suicide
with a suitcase.

29:12.806 --> 29:15.999
- What suitcase?
- Hers.

29:16.034 --> 29:19.126
They found it floating
in the river.

29:27.403 --> 29:28.679
Castro.

29:29.279 --> 29:31.056
Who was it?

29:35.411 --> 29:37.354
I don't know.

30:51.692 --> 30:54.777
We got back to the hotel late.
I didn't want to wake you.

30:54.778 --> 30:56.971
Late means late.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.615
What do I do if there's no phone,
paint one?

30:59.616 --> 31:01.701
I'm working, don't start.

31:01.702 --> 31:04.814
I am calm.
You're the one who isn't!

31:04.872 --> 31:06.523
Good morning.

31:08.125 --> 31:09.986
I'm sorry.

31:24.141 --> 31:26.125
- Morning.
- Morning.

31:29.333 --> 31:32.395
- Try the manteca colorá.
- I'm not hungry.

31:36.152 --> 31:39.096
The girls' autopsy just came.

31:41.574 --> 31:44.393
Estrella's pantyhose
had semen on them.

31:45.202 --> 31:47.021
Blood type AB.

31:49.901 --> 31:51.398
I talked to Miguel.

31:51.458 --> 31:54.753
I asked him for a list of all
the Dyane 6's in the area.

31:54.754 --> 31:56.633
When did you talk to him?

31:58.506 --> 32:01.056
- Early.
- You never sleep?

32:01.761 --> 32:04.219
- Sure I do.
- When?

32:04.220 --> 32:07.415
When you do, that's why
you never see me.

32:45.512 --> 32:48.039
The forensic said it
was a boat propeller.

32:52.559 --> 32:56.087
Nobody in her family knew
she was leaving town to work.

33:05.947 --> 33:08.334
The girls had one just like it.

33:12.329 --> 33:15.272
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
FOR WOMEN

33:20.878 --> 33:24.018
These places aren't on the map.
We don't know where they are.

33:27.592 --> 33:30.329
- What's in it for me?
- What do you want?

33:34.724 --> 33:36.251
What size are those?

33:37.270 --> 33:38.588
Size big.

33:39.437 --> 33:42.340
These places are hard to find.

33:45.448 --> 33:47.336
Almost 500 pesetas.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.830
- Five hundred.
- And the smokes.

34:00.959 --> 34:02.902
For the ride.

34:24.231 --> 34:26.966
I told you, nobody lives there.
It's abandoned.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.433
Want me to open it?

35:03.353 --> 35:05.838
Looks like they left in a hurry.

35:06.271 --> 35:09.900
They left when they found out
their daughter had drowned.

35:09.935 --> 35:12.950
They couldn't set foot
in the house after that.

35:35.008 --> 35:36.658
You know them?

35:39.846 --> 35:43.348
Beatriz, Estrella and Carmen.
Charlie's Angels.

35:43.350 --> 35:46.044
The one in the middle is Quini.

36:40.404 --> 36:42.597
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:42.949 --> 36:46.576
His mother disappeared
three years ago.

36:46.578 --> 36:50.252
My husband gave her this cross.
She never took it off.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.812
My Adela said it was good luck.

36:52.847 --> 36:54.905
I have something to show you.

36:57.672 --> 37:00.240
Did you notice anything
strange before she left?

37:00.798 --> 37:04.027
- My granddaughter was very sad when Quini left her.
- Quini?

37:04.062 --> 37:07.122
Quini, from Villa-Franco.
The good-looking one.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.059
She didn't say where
she was going?

37:10.094 --> 37:14.133
To find work. She said
she'd come back for us after.

37:18.316 --> 37:20.760
These books are hers.

37:21.736 --> 37:25.222
She was going to night
school to get her diploma.

37:32.455 --> 37:35.165
- Can we take these?
- Please don't lose them.

37:35.398 --> 37:37.166
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.855
Who are you?
What the fuck do you want?

39:44.625 --> 39:46.360
Okay, okay!

39:49.170 --> 39:51.343
You, stay put.

39:58.044 --> 40:01.179
- Did you know Carmen and Estrella?
- Everyone did.

40:01.224 --> 40:02.890
What was your relationship?

40:02.892 --> 40:04.808
You already know.
I dated Carmen for a couple months.

40:04.810 --> 40:07.661
- A little young, no?
- Young for what?

40:12.026 --> 40:14.960
- Did you take photos of her?
- Do I look like a photographer?

40:14.995 --> 40:16.910
Want me to hit you again?

40:19.116 --> 40:21.852
Where were you the
night they disappeared?

40:21.910 --> 40:25.163
September 17th, six days ago.
Where?

40:25.198 --> 40:26.883
With a friend.

40:26.918 --> 40:29.200
Blonde, long hair, 16 years old?

40:29.235 --> 40:31.486
- Is that how you like them?
- Motherfucker!

40:33.546 --> 40:35.546
Stop, stop, stop!

40:35.548 --> 40:37.950
Okay, okay.

40:42.514 --> 40:44.230
Where were you?

40:48.086 --> 40:50.820
You already know,
I was with Marina the whole time.

40:57.278 --> 40:59.347
How do you know her?

40:59.488 --> 41:01.057
I don't.

41:04.118 --> 41:06.849
- And this one?
- Nope.

41:07.413 --> 41:09.647
Why are you in the photo?

41:10.355 --> 41:12.613
Must have met her that night.

41:26.806 --> 41:28.674
Can I go now?

41:29.935 --> 41:31.502
Get out.

41:36.441 --> 41:38.508
That's my knife.

41:43.238 --> 41:45.057
Take it.

42:12.433 --> 42:14.768
They're all the same age.

42:14.770 --> 42:16.078
Very young.

42:16.113 --> 42:17.778
Adela disappeared
on September 14th,

42:17.813 --> 42:20.482
Beatriz the 15th,
Carmen and Estrella the 17th.

42:20.484 --> 42:24.735
In '77, '78 and '80.
During the fair.

42:24.770 --> 42:26.614
- The town is busier.
- People drink more,

42:26.649 --> 42:28.616
it takes longer to notice
someone missing,

42:28.651 --> 42:30.333
more people meet...

42:30.368 --> 42:32.703
It could be an outsider,
but they all knew Quini.

42:33.104 --> 42:35.104
- And they all wanted to leave.
- Did you see his hand?

42:35.393 --> 42:38.149
Triangle tattoo.
Like in the photo.

42:39.626 --> 42:41.028
Boss.

42:43.421 --> 42:46.574
- What's her name? The one in green.
- Macarena.

42:47.550 --> 42:50.412
Give her this and another round.

42:52.807 --> 42:54.971
- It's strange.
- What is?

42:54.975 --> 42:57.267
He's good-looking,
he could have any girl.

42:57.269 --> 42:58.711
Why does he do it?

43:06.236 --> 43:09.112
You look tired.
You should go to bed.

43:09.114 --> 43:12.851
Take the car, I don't mind.
I'll walk back.

43:21.333 --> 43:24.962
<i>Wednesday morning
200 workers with pickets</i>

43:24.997 --> 43:27.505
<i>blocked the national highway</i>

43:27.507 --> 43:29.469
<i>at four different spots...</i>

43:38.975 --> 43:41.044
- Evening.
- Evening.

43:48.026 --> 43:49.635
I'm coming!

43:53.073 --> 43:54.557
I'm alone.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.033
- Can I come in'?
- Yeah, sure.

43:57.035 --> 43:59.102
Just a moment.

44:13.259 --> 44:15.786
What can you tell me about this?

44:18.931 --> 44:22.599
- That she has nice tits.
- It's Carmen, she's dead.

44:23.518 --> 44:26.213
She had nice tits.

44:27.313 --> 44:29.650
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.

44:29.685 --> 44:32.160
- Where did you get it?
- That's not your concern.

44:32.195 --> 44:35.179
- I'm a journalist.
- Don't make me laugh.

44:38.773 --> 44:41.685
- Send it to Madrid. See what they say.
- I don't have time.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.805
What do you want?

44:44.455 --> 44:46.607
Something I don't know.

44:48.459 --> 44:50.361
They were tortured.

44:51.046 --> 44:52.974
Were they raped?

45:04.392 --> 45:06.877
I read your letter in the paper.
I liked it.

45:07.687 --> 45:11.089
If you catch me younger,
I make you a hero.

45:14.568 --> 45:16.993
It's a very rare film.

45:17.028 --> 45:19.112
Not a common brand.
Imported.

45:19.114 --> 45:23.059
I don't think many people
around here use a roll like that.

45:24.244 --> 45:26.479
I can find out who does.

45:29.041 --> 45:32.210
But I want the photos
of their cadavers.

45:32.211 --> 45:34.028
From the autopsy.

45:34.128 --> 45:37.636
I have a family. I have to put
food on the table.

45:38.383 --> 45:40.342
Does your family
know what you do?

45:40.344 --> 45:43.411
My family thinks I'm the
next Truman Capote.

45:45.306 --> 45:48.542
He's an American writer.
Never mind.

45:49.352 --> 45:50.962
Find out.

45:53.230 --> 45:56.190
I've seen your partner too,
but I don't remember where.

45:56.192 --> 45:59.428
Do you know if he ever
worked in Vallecas?

46:53.121 --> 46:55.315
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

46:55.458 --> 46:56.817
I'm sorry.

47:02.632 --> 47:06.243
I found my daughters' bankbook.

47:07.553 --> 47:11.290
My husband had it
hidden in the car.

48:36.263 --> 48:39.499
We found this in the glove
compartment of your car.

48:47.983 --> 48:50.509
What's going on, Rodrigo?

48:53.697 --> 48:56.974
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.

48:58.576 --> 49:00.270
Pay who?

49:00.454 --> 49:02.521
A loan shark.

49:03.123 --> 49:04.815
Why?

49:05.333 --> 49:08.985
Because I wanted to get
my family out of here.

49:11.213 --> 49:14.242
I didn't want my daughters
in this town anymore.

49:19.180 --> 49:22.332
You borrowed money
for your daughters?

50:02.722 --> 50:03.937
Stop...

50:03.972 --> 50:05.999
What's wrong with you?

50:09.061 --> 50:10.545
What is it?

50:10.771 --> 50:12.590
What's wrong?

50:13.565 --> 50:17.010
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.

50:20.446 --> 50:22.387
A brick of what?
Tobacco?

50:22.908 --> 50:24.600
Heroin.

50:25.451 --> 50:27.732
You know what that is?

50:29.455 --> 50:31.399
How much did it weigh?

50:34.335 --> 50:35.861
One kilo.

50:36.296 --> 50:38.364
What did you do with it?

50:40.091 --> 50:41.785
I sold it.

50:43.136 --> 50:45.913
What did you do with the money?

50:48.350 --> 50:49.909
I spent it.

50:50.060 --> 50:51.822
On what?

50:53.729 --> 50:56.298
The car outside.

50:57.066 --> 51:00.053
Do you think that's why
they killed your daughters?

51:01.695 --> 51:03.347
I don't know.

51:05.407 --> 51:07.963
They came here for their money.

51:08.785 --> 51:11.104
They took the washing machine,

51:11.621 --> 51:15.150
the fridge, the television...

51:17.086 --> 51:20.990
If I don't pay,
they'll take the car and the boat.

51:23.132 --> 51:25.784
We'll have to move away.

51:49.241 --> 51:51.072
We need to talk
to the Civil Guard.

51:51.107 --> 51:53.224
Have them step up surveillance
at the Point.

51:53.259 --> 51:55.769
We have to find
whoever owns that heroin.

51:55.804 --> 51:57.903
I'll take the river.

51:57.938 --> 51:59.719
I'll take Quini.

53:38.931 --> 53:41.916
HUNTING LODGE FOR RENT

56:03.571 --> 56:05.221
Yes.

56:05.781 --> 56:08.225
Okay, thanks a lot.

56:09.243 --> 56:11.076
Marina's at her house.

56:11.078 --> 56:13.647
Her mother says she's fine.

56:17.042 --> 56:19.710
The Civil Guard is mixed
up in all of this.

56:19.712 --> 56:21.469
Someone's tipping them off.

56:21.504 --> 56:23.589
The whole town smokes
American tobacco

56:23.591 --> 56:26.451
and there's not a single butt
on any of the boats.

56:26.926 --> 56:29.829
They have to get by on something
between harvests.

56:30.095 --> 56:31.539
Go in.

56:39.021 --> 56:40.465
Sit there.

56:41.481 --> 56:44.363
- I'm fine standing.
- Sit, damn it.

56:51.742 --> 56:53.973
What were you doing at
the hunting lodge earlier?

56:54.008 --> 56:56.204
I was with my girlfriend.
Wanna hear the details?

56:56.206 --> 56:57.921
Yes, I do.

56:57.956 --> 56:59.941
Nobody ever explained it to you?

57:05.547 --> 57:08.846
- Who's the man in the hat?
- What man?

57:08.884 --> 57:11.761
The guy who went in after you,
before I got my head bashed in.

57:11.796 --> 57:14.518
Nobody came in.
I told you, we were alone.

57:16.658 --> 57:19.418
You want my blood, is that it?

57:20.520 --> 57:23.407
Call the doctor, I'll wait.

57:25.400 --> 57:29.761
Too bad you didn't bring your pajamas.
You're sleeping here.

57:38.204 --> 57:40.726
<i>...including Lora del Rio
and other towns.</i>

57:40.761 --> 57:43.249
<i>The situation is
becoming very serious.</i>

57:43.251 --> 57:45.807
<i>Similar incidents are
taking place as they had</i>

57:45.842 --> 57:48.363
<i>in recent years in the
Andalusian countryside.</i>

57:48.381 --> 57:49.580
Damn!

57:53.385 --> 57:55.079
Are you okay?

58:03.270 --> 58:06.827
These are Joaquin Varela's
blood test results. Quini.

58:06.862 --> 58:10.384
His blood type doesn't match
the one we're looking for.

58:15.739 --> 58:18.058
I remind you this
is a democracy.

58:18.576 --> 58:22.078
Next time you want to arrest
someone, you ask me first.

58:22.079 --> 58:24.273
This country isn't what it was.

58:25.161 --> 58:28.058
The harvest is soon
and people are nervous.

58:28.109 --> 58:31.279
Please don't waste any more time.
Good day.

58:35.466 --> 58:37.199
You're not going
to school today?

58:37.234 --> 58:39.711
I'm sick.
My stomach hurts.

58:40.305 --> 58:42.624
What did you do
yesterday afternoon?

58:42.682 --> 58:44.626
I went to a movie.

58:44.977 --> 58:46.696
With who?

58:46.731 --> 58:49.720
- With some friends.
- What friends?

58:51.191 --> 58:53.760
One moment, I'll be right back.

59:01.035 --> 59:03.834
Who were you with yesterday
at the hunting lodge?

59:05.454 --> 59:07.998
Who was the man in the hat,
Marina?

59:08.033 --> 59:09.692
What man?

59:10.585 --> 59:12.753
Aren't you a little hot
in that sweater?

59:12.788 --> 59:14.614
I'm sick.

59:15.590 --> 59:17.340
How did you hurt yourself?

59:17.342 --> 59:19.467
- What?
- Your wrist.

59:19.469 --> 59:21.746
My watch gives me a rash.

59:22.597 --> 59:25.231
Cut the nonsense.
Who was the man in the hat?

59:25.266 --> 59:27.738
- I don't know who you mean.
- Where's Quini? - I don't know.

59:27.773 --> 59:29.779
- You're sick and he hasn't come to visit?
- I didn't tell him.

59:29.833 --> 59:31.261
Why don't you call him?

59:31.410 --> 59:33.054
- Mom!
- Marina, look at me.

59:33.190 --> 59:36.261
- Does your mom know what you do at the lodge?
- Mom!

59:36.401 --> 59:38.909
- Tell us who the man is or we'll tell her.
- Mom!

59:42.698 --> 59:45.314
- What is it?
- I don't feel well.

59:45.701 --> 59:49.540
- My stomach hurts. I'm going to throw up.
- Honey, what's wrong?

59:49.575 --> 59:52.149
Don't worry, ma'am.
We were just leaving.

59:52.750 --> 59:55.192
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

59:55.379 --> 59:57.074
Marina?

01:00:03.303 --> 01:00:06.380
- What are you doing?
- Did you believe a word she said?

01:00:06.415 --> 01:00:09.458
Me neither. She's scared
and I'm going to find out why.

01:00:51.683 --> 01:00:54.731
There are five bedrooms,
each with several beds.

01:00:55.477 --> 01:00:58.714
I have extra beds if
there are more of you.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.174
There's room outside
for the dogs.

01:01:01.526 --> 01:01:04.469
There's water, electricity...
Anyway...

01:01:04.736 --> 01:01:06.237
All the comforts.

01:01:06.239 --> 01:01:08.014
- Can I have a look?
- Yes.

01:01:08.823 --> 01:01:10.904
Do you know the area?

01:01:10.975 --> 01:01:13.520
- Is the house yours?
- I wish.

01:01:15.914 --> 01:01:20.151
We have fans available
if you need them.

01:01:36.017 --> 01:01:39.969
- Whose house is it?
- The owner lives in Valencia.

01:01:39.978 --> 01:01:42.708
She hasn't come in years,
she's very old...

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:45.362
- Who rented it last?
- I don't remember.

01:01:45.484 --> 01:01:48.276
It's been closed for a long time.
It's the off season.

01:01:49.112 --> 01:01:53.141
I was here yesterday and I saw
three people enter the house.

01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:00.524
Nice, very pretty.

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.431
You're hurting me!

01:02:05.462 --> 01:02:07.922
I asked you a question.
Who was here yesterday?

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:09.340
I don't know who rents it.

01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:11.745
You rent it and you
don't know to who?

01:02:12.093 --> 01:02:14.358
I rent it to him by the day.

01:02:14.576 --> 01:02:18.932
He calls me right before and
puts the money in an account.

01:02:18.934 --> 01:02:21.864
Lower your voice.
Who's the man in the hat?

01:02:22.229 --> 01:02:23.479
Who is he?

01:02:23.514 --> 01:02:26.631
I don't know anything.
I get paid not to meddle.

01:02:27.608 --> 01:02:29.135
What are you doing?

01:02:39.579 --> 01:02:41.286
What's going on here?

01:02:41.288 --> 01:02:45.817
Nothing. These gentlemen came to
see the house. They were just leaving.

01:02:49.003 --> 01:02:50.739
Good afternoon.

01:02:59.181 --> 01:03:01.641
- Who is that? Do you know him?
- The watchman?

01:03:01.676 --> 01:03:04.127
Never seen him in my life.

01:03:31.588 --> 01:03:33.406
Take a stroll, Jesus.

01:03:40.178 --> 01:03:42.496
Drive.
I'll tell you where to go.

01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:14.194
Go inside.

01:04:15.712 --> 01:04:17.238
Go on.

01:04:27.642 --> 01:04:29.627
Have a seat.

01:04:31.562 --> 01:04:35.138
Eugenio, give them something
to drink, it's hot.

01:04:40.196 --> 01:04:42.655
The heroin Rodrigo
found was mine,

01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:45.285
but he didn't find it,
he stole it.

01:04:45.492 --> 01:04:47.894
But I didn't kill anyone.

01:04:48.244 --> 01:04:51.932
That's Fermin over there.
Angelita is his wife.

01:04:51.967 --> 01:04:54.155
You've already met.
She's not psychic.

01:04:54.272 --> 01:04:57.581
Fermin was at the farmhouse
the night the girls were killed.

01:04:57.663 --> 01:05:01.266
He knows more than what was
in the well. But there's a price.

01:05:01.301 --> 01:05:02.611
What do you want?

01:05:02.646 --> 01:05:05.001
Withdraw the Civil Guard
from the Point.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.746
Okay or not?

01:05:10.599 --> 01:05:12.376
- Okay.
- Tell them, Fermin.

01:05:12.601 --> 01:05:15.185
I saw the man who
threw the bag in the well.

01:05:15.187 --> 01:05:18.405
- What did he look like?
- I didn't see his face, it was too dark.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.593
But he was normal,
a normal person.

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:24.521
It was the same day
the girls disappeared.

01:05:24.571 --> 01:05:27.640
I was at the farmhouse
waiting for a brick.

01:05:27.658 --> 01:05:30.825
- It was five in the morning.
- What kind of car was it?

01:05:30.828 --> 01:05:34.386
A white Dyane 6.
He drove right past me.

01:05:34.707 --> 01:05:37.666
The car had a sticker
on the back window.

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:39.175
What kind of sticker?

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:41.988
A woman with long
hair and a hat.

01:05:43.131 --> 01:05:47.341
- How long? This long?
- A little shorter.

01:05:47.552 --> 01:05:51.593
- What was the hat like?
- Big. Like a priest.

01:05:52.557 --> 01:05:53.756
Like this?

01:05:56.059 --> 01:05:58.503
I've seen this before somewhere.

01:06:04.985 --> 01:06:08.138
- Anything else, Fermin?
- That's what I saw.

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:22.609
Hey.

01:06:25.004 --> 01:06:27.073
I did see your problem.

01:06:27.089 --> 01:06:30.252
The dead are waiting for you.
It's almost time.

01:07:23.101 --> 01:07:25.603
He gave her these towels.

01:07:25.605 --> 01:07:29.049
They were from the hotel
where he worked in Malaga.

01:07:35.447 --> 01:07:37.574
- What was her friend's name?
- Sebastian.

01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:39.615
- Sebastian what?
- I don't know.

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:41.575
- Is he from around here?
- I don't know.

01:07:41.595 --> 01:07:43.538
- Have you ever seen him?
- Never.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:46.419
- What else did she say?
- That he was nice to her.

01:07:46.454 --> 01:07:48.508
That he helped her
get over Quini.

01:07:50.629 --> 01:07:52.113
Thank you.

01:07:54.758 --> 01:07:56.033
Bye, buddy.

01:07:56.385 --> 01:07:57.785
Goodbye.

01:08:02.098 --> 01:08:03.786
His name is Sebastian
Rovira Galvez.

01:08:03.821 --> 01:08:06.063
He doesn't work at the hotel
anymore. He got fired.

01:08:06.098 --> 01:08:08.176
They still have some
of his things there.

01:08:08.229 --> 01:08:09.914
We need to get them.

01:08:22.951 --> 01:08:24.770
MOTHER WITH FRIEND

01:08:49.185 --> 01:08:52.837
TOMORROW AT 7:30 AT THE CROSS.
GO ALONE.

01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:31.247
The photos of the girls were
taken with a roll like that one.

01:09:33.103 --> 01:09:35.895
- Only one place sells them.
- Where?

01:09:35.898 --> 01:09:37.482
Where are my photos?

01:09:37.517 --> 01:09:40.752
- I don't have them yet.
- And what do you have?

01:09:48.911 --> 01:09:50.893
Aguila Photography, in Seville.

01:09:50.928 --> 01:09:53.988
Someone places a prepaid
order every month.

01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:57.947
- Who?
- A good-looking guy named Quino or Quini.

01:09:58.419 --> 01:10:01.212
They develop them there too,
but they wouldn't tell me about them.

01:10:01.214 --> 01:10:03.825
But definitely not
communion photos.

01:10:09.054 --> 01:10:10.846
I think there's
someone else there.

01:10:10.848 --> 01:10:14.614
You can see the reflection of whoever
took the photo. He's blurred by the flash.

01:10:14.649 --> 01:10:16.879
Tell me who he is and
you'll get your photos.

01:10:17.897 --> 01:10:22.402
All right, but I'll need the negative.
Otherwise it's impossible.

01:10:22.527 --> 01:10:25.194
I won't use it.
You can trust me.

01:10:25.229 --> 01:10:27.860
Would you trust
someone like you?

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.686
You have my word.

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.991
Can he sleep at night?

01:10:46.465 --> 01:10:47.665
Your partner.

01:10:48.593 --> 01:10:50.285
I remembered.

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:53.762
He was in the
Social-Political Brigade.

01:10:53.763 --> 01:10:56.208
You know, Franco's Gestapo.

01:10:56.307 --> 01:11:00.394
He killed a girl at a protest
in Vallecas in '71.

01:11:00.467 --> 01:11:02.323
Shot her twice.

01:11:02.397 --> 01:11:04.565
He's aged badly.

01:11:05.109 --> 01:11:06.634
And I'm glad.

01:12:48.788 --> 01:12:50.527
Hello.
How are you?

01:13:05.349 --> 01:13:06.625
That's Marina.

01:13:08.895 --> 01:13:11.505
She and my daughters
were close friends.

01:13:13.607 --> 01:13:16.776
Quini took her to the hunting
lodge the other day.

01:13:16.777 --> 01:13:19.696
After they were together he
asked her not to get dressed,

01:13:19.697 --> 01:13:21.641
and he tied her to the bed.

01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:26.227
Then he left the room and
came back with another man.

01:13:33.711 --> 01:13:35.279
Who was he?

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:38.187
She didn't see his face.

01:13:38.222 --> 01:13:41.517
All she knows is he smelled good,
like expensive cologne.

01:13:41.552 --> 01:13:43.804
And that he had very soft hands.

01:13:48.016 --> 01:13:50.336
He took photographs of her.

01:13:50.351 --> 01:13:53.396
Quini threatened to show
them to everyone in town,

01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:55.464
if she told anyone.

01:13:59.027 --> 01:14:01.930
The night my daughters
were killed...

01:14:03.948 --> 01:14:08.101
Marina was with Quini,
but not the whole night.

01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:16.569
Do you think she'd be
able to tell a judge?

01:14:17.377 --> 01:14:20.082
She couldn't even tell you.

01:14:30.682 --> 01:14:32.666
I have to go.

01:15:06.342 --> 01:15:08.588
Good afternoon.
I'm Pedro Suarez.

01:15:08.623 --> 01:15:11.205
- The manager is expecting me.
- One moment, please.

01:15:15.017 --> 01:15:19.379
ACCESS PROHIBITED
TO NON-EMPLOYEES

01:15:22.525 --> 01:15:23.900
It's this suitcase.

01:15:23.901 --> 01:15:26.303
- Shall I open it?
- Yes, open it.

01:15:32.784 --> 01:15:36.078
The guy was really weird.
He had a problem with a guest.

01:15:36.079 --> 01:15:37.325
What problem?

01:15:37.372 --> 01:15:39.892
Something weird
with a very young girl.

01:15:39.927 --> 01:15:43.256
I think that's why he vanished
all of a sudden. Poof...

01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:45.304
...and he was gone.

01:15:50.134 --> 01:15:52.369
Rovira Galvez, Sebastian.

01:15:52.721 --> 01:15:55.164
Sexual assault on a minor?

01:15:55.222 --> 01:15:57.458
Whereabouts unknown...

01:15:57.892 --> 01:15:59.976
A two-year-old
warrant for his arrest...

01:15:59.977 --> 01:16:01.520
Anything else?

01:16:01.521 --> 01:16:05.287
Any friends who know him?
No, he has no family.

01:16:05.322 --> 01:16:07.524
Nobody in his town
ever saw him again.

01:16:07.525 --> 01:16:10.261
He didn't even go to
his mother's funeral.

01:16:12.489 --> 01:16:13.988
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:14.023 --> 01:16:15.869
Thank you very much.

01:16:33.842 --> 01:16:37.636
The wages are nothing!
It's not enough to survive on!

01:16:37.638 --> 01:16:41.582
You should know we're
going through rough times.

01:16:41.934 --> 01:16:45.895
Mr. Alfonso is offering
20% more than last year.

01:16:45.897 --> 01:16:49.648
- 150 pesetas more per day.
- That's nothing!

01:16:59.952 --> 01:17:05.133
Silence, please!
170 pesetas. That's his final offer.

01:17:05.269 --> 01:17:08.102
Anyone who doesn't want
to work can stay home.

01:17:08.188 --> 01:17:10.245
We've too many people already.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.731
If you want to sign up,
get in line.

01:17:30.607 --> 01:17:32.482
Sir!

01:17:32.483 --> 01:17:33.884
Hey!

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.520
Excuse me.

01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:41.907
Juan Robles. I just wanted
to introduce myself.

01:17:41.909 --> 01:17:43.243
Alfonso Corrales.

01:17:43.244 --> 01:17:46.224
I'm with the police.
I'm here about the murders.

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:49.472
If I can be of any help...
Let me know if you need anything.

01:17:49.769 --> 01:17:51.651
- See you around.
- Thank you.

01:20:52.718 --> 01:20:54.078
Yes.

01:20:55.137 --> 01:20:57.331
Yes, don't worry.

01:20:57.599 --> 01:20:58.798
Of course.

01:21:00.517 --> 01:21:02.293
Good night, Manuel, and thanks.

01:21:04.271 --> 01:21:08.311
The field boss says there's no
Dyane 6 on the Corrales property,

01:21:08.346 --> 01:21:09.968
neither registered
or unregistered.

01:21:10.003 --> 01:21:12.484
And Marina's mother says
her daughter is at a movie.

01:21:12.988 --> 01:21:16.407
I'll call Mr. Corrales tomorrow and
have him come in for a blood test.

01:21:16.442 --> 01:21:18.725
- It's late for today.
- It's 11 o'clock.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.752
I don't think it's late.
I'll call him tomorrow morning.

01:21:22.205 --> 01:21:24.250
I don't think there
will be any problem.

01:21:24.285 --> 01:21:27.815
Right now I'm going to have
them check on the girl.

01:21:27.919 --> 01:21:30.780
I'm not asking you to
call him on the telephone.

01:21:30.815 --> 01:21:34.704
I'm asking you to authorize
a blood test. Right now.

01:21:35.051 --> 01:21:39.773
And I also want authorization to
question Corrales and Quini together.

01:21:41.264 --> 01:21:43.633
I heard you were a troublemaker.

01:21:43.668 --> 01:21:45.048
What did you say?

01:21:45.102 --> 01:21:47.199
All you have is literature.

01:21:47.313 --> 01:21:50.664
Your partner saw a man in a hat.
Nothing more.

01:21:50.699 --> 01:21:51.958
Isn't that right?

01:21:52.485 --> 01:21:53.880
That's right.

01:21:54.277 --> 01:21:57.945
I wear a hat too.
Does that make me a suspect too?

01:21:58.991 --> 01:22:02.430
I won't authorize anything until
you bring me something conclusive.

01:22:02.465 --> 01:22:05.480
Now please leave.
I'll call you when I hear back.

01:22:05.515 --> 01:22:07.465
You're protecting him.

01:22:10.169 --> 01:22:11.570
What?

01:22:16.173 --> 01:22:18.485
You don't know how things
work around here.

01:22:18.593 --> 01:22:21.310
Yes, I do.
Just like everywhere else.

01:22:23.181 --> 01:22:24.892
You're going to be a father.

01:22:24.927 --> 01:22:28.018
You should be more careful
about what you do.

01:22:28.645 --> 01:22:30.338
Get out.

01:22:41.407 --> 01:22:43.182
Why didn't you say anything?

01:22:44.118 --> 01:22:46.535
Whose side are you on?
Are you with them too?

01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:48.913
I just want to solve this case.
I don't want to be taken off it.

01:22:48.948 --> 01:22:51.174
You're just like
the rest of them.

01:22:51.209 --> 01:22:53.400
You'd rather things
were like before.

01:22:53.627 --> 01:22:56.003
I know what you used to do.
I know about Vallecas.

01:22:56.038 --> 01:22:58.530
You don't know anything.
Nothing!

01:23:00.258 --> 01:23:02.903
Be careful who you get
your information from.

01:23:02.938 --> 01:23:05.098
- That guy is out for blood.
- Let me go.

01:23:11.979 --> 01:23:15.006
It was an accident.
And it wasn't me.

01:23:15.439 --> 01:23:18.551
It was my partner.
I didn't even draw my weapon.

01:23:18.984 --> 01:23:22.971
If you killed someone,
I'd cover for you too. Is that wrong?

01:23:24.282 --> 01:23:26.391
Let's go to Marina's house.

01:23:32.497 --> 01:23:36.068
<i>No, how could he be the father?
He's 87 years old!</i>

01:23:39.921 --> 01:23:42.949
<i>Tell them I'll do anything,
I don't care.</i>

01:24:06.363 --> 01:24:08.385
<i>- Hello?
- It's me.</i>

01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:10.102
<i>Hi, Marina.</i>

01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:13.496
<i>I wanted to know what's
happening with Malaga.</i>

01:24:13.531 --> 01:24:15.563
<i>When will they call me?</i>

01:24:15.748 --> 01:24:19.192
<i>Look, there was a problem
with your contract.</i>

01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:22.070
<i>They're not hiring anyone
until next year.</i>

01:24:23.254 --> 01:24:24.947
<i>Talk to them.</i>

01:24:25.508 --> 01:24:28.744
<i>Tell them I'll do anything,
I don't care.</i>

01:24:29.428 --> 01:24:31.746
<i>I have to get out of here.</i>

01:24:31.763 --> 01:24:33.956
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

01:24:33.973 --> 01:24:37.084
<i>Let's meet. At the usual
spot in half an hour.</i>

01:24:37.602 --> 01:24:40.464
She called this number.
It's the hunting lodge.

01:24:51.031 --> 01:24:52.766
It's okay.

01:24:55.244 --> 01:24:56.896
Coming!

01:24:57.704 --> 01:24:59.565
Who is it?

01:25:03.794 --> 01:25:06.088
- Who else lives in this house?
- Nobody.

01:25:06.123 --> 01:25:08.138
- Who?
- The watchman.

01:25:08.173 --> 01:25:10.258
- What's his name?
- Antonio.

01:25:10.259 --> 01:25:12.386
- Who is Sebastian?
- I don't know.

01:25:12.387 --> 01:25:14.305
- Stop.
- Where is Sebastian?

01:25:14.738 --> 01:25:16.457
I said stop!

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.172
Sit down.

01:25:37.327 --> 01:25:40.526
Do you know who
Carmen and Estrella were?

01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:47.666
Before they killed them,
they tortured them.

01:25:50.297 --> 01:25:53.547
With a hunting knife and pliers.

01:25:54.342 --> 01:25:57.121
They ripped off their nipples.

01:25:58.221 --> 01:26:00.900
They cut off their toes.

01:26:02.268 --> 01:26:06.712
They stuck something in their
ass and vagina until they bled.

01:26:10.025 --> 01:26:12.941
They were awake the whole time.

01:26:14.988 --> 01:26:19.224
You can't imagine how much pain
a person can bear before fainting.

01:26:19.576 --> 01:26:21.686
I didn't know.

01:26:23.621 --> 01:26:26.290
I didn't know, I didn't know...

01:26:26.325 --> 01:26:27.817
Look at me.

01:26:30.003 --> 01:26:32.405
What's the watchman's name?

01:26:35.716 --> 01:26:37.076
Sebastian.

01:26:37.802 --> 01:26:41.487
He came looking for work and I hired him.
His mother was my friend.

01:26:41.848 --> 01:26:45.485
- He needed to hide.
- Hide from what?

01:26:47.228 --> 01:26:48.879
I don't know.

01:26:49.356 --> 01:26:51.632
He had changed a lot.

01:26:52.857 --> 01:26:54.441
I hardly recognized him.

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:57.446
- Do you know Alfonso Corrales?
- Yes.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.455
Have you ever seen
him in this house?

01:27:00.490 --> 01:27:04.770
I don't come here when
the house is rented out.

01:27:07.705 --> 01:27:09.273
Where is Sebastian?

01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:14.112
Where?

01:27:16.423 --> 01:27:19.437
At the abandoned house
at the lodge.

01:27:47.035 --> 01:27:48.395
Open it.

01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:24.361
Juan!

01:29:27.507 --> 01:29:30.759
A contract in Estrella Blanco's name
to work at the Hotel Medio Dia.

01:29:30.761 --> 01:29:33.163
And there are more,
with other girls' names.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.970
Hey!

01:29:41.021 --> 01:29:43.021
There goes the car!

01:29:43.022 --> 01:29:44.716
Come on!

01:29:49.488 --> 01:29:52.098
Careful,
it's slippery in the rain.

01:29:52.156 --> 01:29:54.607
Careful!

01:30:00.372 --> 01:30:02.358
Go, go, go!

01:30:02.457 --> 01:30:03.874
It's stuck.

01:30:03.876 --> 01:30:06.568
This road leads only
to the Marshland.

01:30:07.547 --> 01:30:09.364
There's a shortcut over here!

01:31:44.723 --> 01:31:46.167
Freeze!

01:34:39.225 --> 01:34:41.168
Murderer!

01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:05.442
Yeah?
They asked about me?

01:35:05.667 --> 01:35:06.986
Who?

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:09.028
To congratulate me?

01:35:10.422 --> 01:35:13.326
A telegram?
Open it.

01:35:14.551 --> 01:35:16.996
DEATH IN MARSHLAND
GIRLS BUTCHERED

01:35:19.389 --> 01:35:22.792
No, skip that.
Where it says "Destination."

01:35:24.103 --> 01:35:26.576
Alcobendas?
That's Madrid.

01:35:26.611 --> 01:35:29.050
I can practically walk there.

01:35:29.524 --> 01:35:31.268
How are you?

01:35:31.818 --> 01:35:34.819
Of course I miss you.
A lot.

01:35:34.854 --> 01:35:37.170
I can't wait to see you both.

01:35:41.952 --> 01:35:43.460
Pedro, come here.

01:35:43.495 --> 01:35:46.747
This is Macarena and...

01:35:46.749 --> 01:35:48.666
Don't tell me...
Tell me.

01:35:48.668 --> 01:35:50.175
Marivi.

01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:53.355
Turn around, let him get a
look at you. Go on, turn.

01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:55.522
You two are gorgeous.

01:35:55.557 --> 01:35:57.164
My partner, Pedro.

01:35:57.199 --> 01:35:59.323
- Say hi to Pedro.
- Hi, Pedro.

01:35:59.358 --> 01:36:01.888
They work at the crab factory.

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:04.791
We're celebrating
because they got a raise.

01:36:04.975 --> 01:36:07.810
They won the strike.
Long live the working class!

01:36:08.561 --> 01:36:11.451
You want another drink?
Come on, my treat.

01:36:11.486 --> 01:36:13.162
Let's have a drink.

01:36:13.197 --> 01:36:14.571
Pedro, Pedro...

01:36:14.610 --> 01:36:16.242
Where is it?

01:36:16.277 --> 01:36:18.936
- Where have you got it?
- Right here.

01:36:19.364 --> 01:36:20.830
Here.

01:36:22.325 --> 01:36:24.748
Who's that?
Who?

01:36:24.783 --> 01:36:26.855
DOUBLE HOMICIDE SOLVED
IN MARSHLAND

01:36:26.871 --> 01:36:28.087
It's him.

01:36:28.457 --> 01:36:30.590
It's him, he's my friend.

01:36:32.210 --> 01:36:34.087
Here, hold onto it.

01:36:34.122 --> 01:36:35.992
For your son.

01:36:36.027 --> 01:36:37.760
Don't lose it.

01:36:37.882 --> 01:36:40.160
Don't lose it, Pedro.

01:36:42.302 --> 01:36:45.334
Well?
How about that drink?

01:37:08.411 --> 01:37:10.370
You're a hero now.

01:37:13.123 --> 01:37:14.817
Your photos.

01:37:16.586 --> 01:37:18.521
There's somebody else
but you can't see who.

01:37:18.627 --> 01:37:20.594
It's just a spot.

01:37:34.729 --> 01:37:36.212
To Truman Capote.

01:37:37.232 --> 01:37:39.258
To Truman Capote.

01:37:45.863 --> 01:37:49.886
You were misinformed.
It wasn't him. It was an accident.

01:37:59.545 --> 01:38:01.071
A gift.

01:38:02.339 --> 01:38:04.782
This enlargement
came out better.

01:38:04.799 --> 01:38:07.868
Taken the day the girl
was killed at the protest.

01:38:10.972 --> 01:38:13.318
They called him the Crow.

01:38:13.516 --> 01:38:17.622
He alone tortured
over 100 people.

01:38:17.969 --> 01:38:19.870
And he was the best at it.

01:38:25.611 --> 01:38:27.513
Take care, Pedro.

01:39:29.506 --> 01:39:32.534
Jesus made us some
food for the road.

01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:36.363
- Here, I owed you this.
- What is it?

01:39:36.507 --> 01:39:38.498
Bambi stew.

01:39:39.684 --> 01:39:41.995
- Watch yourself.
- You too.

01:39:56.116 --> 01:39:58.059
We're good, right?
