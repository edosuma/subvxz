The Tardis is in the same place but
the Earth has gone. Exterminate!

00:10.881 --> 00:13.526
Welcome to my new empire.

00:13.561 --> 00:16.041
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

00:16.076 --> 00:18.401
Exterminate Torchwood!

00:25.321 --> 00:27.441
I surrender! I'm sorry!

00:27.476 --> 00:29.561
The Doctor is coming.

00:31.721 --> 00:34.581
He's dying, and you know
what happens next. He can't.

00:34.616 --> 00:37.441
What do you mean, what happens next?
I'm regenerating.

01:34.441 --> 01:36.841
Now then. Where were we?

01:39.201 --> 01:41.441
Exterminate. Exterminate.

01:47.561 --> 01:48.885
Mickey?

01:48.920 --> 01:51.446
Us Smiths gotta stick together!

01:51.481 --> 01:54.721
Jackie Tyler. Rose's mum.
Now where the hell is my daughter?!

02:24.041 --> 02:26.101
What the hell?

02:26.136 --> 02:28.161
There now...

02:31.801 --> 02:34.006
You see?

02:34.041 --> 02:40.365
Used the regeneration energy
to heal myself,

02:40.400 --> 02:44.520
To stop the energy going all
the way, I siphoned off the rest
into a bio-matching receptacle,

02:44.555 --> 02:48.606
namely, my hand,
my hand there, my handy spare hand!

02:48.641 --> 02:53.521
Remember, Christmas Day, Sycorax,
lost my hand in a swordfight?

02:53.556 --> 02:55.120
What d'you think?

02:59.761 --> 03:01.921
You're still you?

03:02.841 --> 03:04.321
I'm still me.

03:10.721 --> 03:12.880
You can hug me, if you want.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.161
No, really, you can hug me.

03:21.761 --> 03:24.926
It's a Time Lock!
The ultimate defence programme.

03:24.961 --> 03:28.521
Tosh was working on it, I never
thought she finished it, but she did!

03:28.556 --> 03:32.040
The Hub's sealed in a time bubble,
nothing can get in!

03:32.075 --> 03:33.686
But that means we can't get out.

03:33.721 --> 03:36.280
Nope.
Not without unlocking that Dalek.

03:36.315 --> 03:38.197
We're trapped inside.

03:38.232 --> 03:40.045
It's all up to Jack now.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.440
Report! Tardis has been located!

03:42.475 --> 03:44.246
Bring it here!

03:44.281 --> 03:46.881
Bring the Doctor to me!

03:46.916 --> 03:49.481
Initiate temporal prison!

03:52.321 --> 03:55.361
Temporal prison initiated!

03:58.840 --> 04:02.080
They've got us! Power's gone!

04:03.801 --> 04:05.440
Some kind of chronon loop.

04:06.681 --> 04:10.601
Transferring Tardis to the Crucible.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.404
Those teleport things,
can we use them?

04:20.440 --> 04:24.365
If they've taken the Doctor
to the Dalek spaceship,
that's where we need to be.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.880
It's not just a teleport,
it's a Dimension Jump. It rips
a hole in the fabric of space.

04:28.915 --> 04:32.841
But can we use it? Not yet,
it burns up energy,
needs half an hour between jumps.

04:32.876 --> 04:35.046
Then put down your guns. Do what?

04:35.081 --> 04:38.241
If you're carrying a gun,
they'll shoot you dead.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.766
Daleks!

04:41.801 --> 04:43.686
I surrender!

04:43.721 --> 04:48.766
All humans in this Sector
will be taken to the Crucible!

04:48.801 --> 04:53.200
She's bloody mad!
Yeah, but Mickey, if they've got
the Doctor, then they've got Rose.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.041
And us! We surrender!

05:02.280 --> 05:06.446
Jack's explained the base code, I
know how the teleport works. I think.

05:06.481 --> 05:11.240
But you stay indoors,
there's no Daleks on this street,
you should be OK, just keep quiet.

05:11.275 --> 05:15.241
But where are you going?
I'm a member of UNIT. They gave me
the Osterhagen Key.

05:15.276 --> 05:18.481
I've got to do my job. I'm sorry.

05:18.516 --> 05:20.006
Martha.

05:20.041 --> 05:22.401
What's an Osterhagen Key?

05:22.436 --> 05:24.406
Tell me.

05:24.441 --> 05:26.200
What does it do?

05:26.235 --> 05:27.721
Love you.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.600
Exterminieren! Exterminieren! Halt!

05:39.635 --> 05:42.886
Sonst werden wir Sie exterminieren!

05:42.921 --> 05:45.801
Sie sind jetzt
ein Gefangener der Daleks!

05:49.000 --> 05:52.441
Exterminieren! Exterminieren!

05:55.240 --> 06:00.201
There's a massive Dalek ship
at the centre of the planets.
They're calling it the Crucible.

06:00.236 --> 06:02.006
Guess that's our destination.

06:02.041 --> 06:04.606
You said these planets were
like an engine. But what for?

06:04.641 --> 06:08.201
Rose? You've been in a parallel
world, that world's running
ahead of this universe.

06:08.236 --> 06:10.800
You've seen the future. What was it?

06:10.835 --> 06:12.766
It's the darkness.

06:12.801 --> 06:14.566
The stars were going out.

06:14.601 --> 06:18.960
One by one. We looked up at the sky
and they were just dying.

06:18.995 --> 06:22.166
Basically, we've been
building this, um...

06:22.201 --> 06:27.201
travel machine, this, er,
Dimension Cannon, so I could...

06:27.236 --> 06:30.001
Well...so I could... What?

06:30.036 --> 06:31.960
So I could come back.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.125
Shut up.

06:34.160 --> 06:39.446
Anyway, suddenly,
it started to work and
the dimensions started to collapse.

06:39.481 --> 06:43.841
Not just in our world or yours,
but the whole of reality.
Even the Void was dead.

06:43.876 --> 06:46.561
Something is destroying everything.

06:46.596 --> 06:48.525
In that parallel world...

06:48.560 --> 06:52.841
You said something about me.
The Dimension Cannon
could measure Time Lines.

06:52.876 --> 06:56.001
It's weird, Donna, but they
all seemed to converge on you.

06:56.036 --> 06:57.601
But why me?

06:58.561 --> 07:00.920
I mean, what have I ever done?

07:00.955 --> 07:03.280
I'm a temp. From Chiswick!

07:05.560 --> 07:09.160
The Dalek Crucible. All aboard!

07:24.801 --> 07:27.001
The Tardis is secured.

07:29.401 --> 07:33.520
Doctor, you will step forth or die.

07:34.801 --> 07:38.000
We'll have to go out.
Cos if we don't, they'll get in.

07:38.035 --> 07:41.200
You told me nothing could
get through those doors.

07:41.235 --> 07:43.966
You've got Extrapolator shielding!

07:44.001 --> 07:48.080
Last time we fought the Daleks,
they were scavengers and hybrids...
and mad,

07:48.115 --> 07:50.521
but this is a fully-fledged
Dalek Empire,

07:50.556 --> 07:52.645
at the height of its power,

07:52.680 --> 07:55.760
experts at fighting Tardises,
they can do anything.

07:55.795 --> 07:58.761
Right now, that wooden door...

07:58.796 --> 08:00.365
is just wood.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.925
What about your Dimension Jump?

08:02.960 --> 08:06.565
It needs another 20 minutes,
and anyway, I'm not leaving.

08:06.600 --> 08:12.441
What about your Teleport? Went
down with the power loss. Right,
then, all of us together. Yeah.

08:12.476 --> 08:14.761
Donna?

08:18.480 --> 08:21.245
Donna? Yeah.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.800
I'm sorry.
There's nothing else we can do.

08:23.835 --> 08:25.321
Look, I know.

08:27.640 --> 08:31.760
Surrender, Doctor,
and face your Dalek masters.

08:31.795 --> 08:34.600
Crucible on maximum alert.

08:34.635 --> 08:36.198
Daleks.

08:36.232 --> 08:37.760
Oh, God!

08:40.600 --> 08:42.480
It's been good, though, hasn't it?

08:42.515 --> 08:44.477
All of us, all of it.

08:44.512 --> 08:46.440
Everything we did.

08:48.481 --> 08:50.561
You were brilliant.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.641
And you were brilliant.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.961
And you were brilliant.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.521
Blimey!

09:11.001 --> 09:14.361
Daleks reign supreme.

09:14.396 --> 09:17.686
All hail the Daleks!

09:17.721 --> 09:21.081
Daleks reign supreme.
All hail the Daleks!

09:21.116 --> 09:27.766
Daleks reign supreme.

09:27.801 --> 09:31.525
All hail the Daleks! Behold, Doctor!

09:31.560 --> 09:36.160
Behold the might
of the true Dalek race!

09:40.880 --> 09:44.080
Donna, you're no safer in there.

09:48.681 --> 09:52.006
Doctor? What have you done?

09:52.041 --> 09:56.040
It wasn't me, I didn't do anything!
Oi, oi, I'm not staying behind!

09:56.075 --> 10:00.080
What did you do?!
This is not of Dalek origin.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.126
Doctor!

10:02.161 --> 10:05.601
Stop it, she's my friend,
now open the door and let her out.

10:05.636 --> 10:07.606
This is Time Lord treachery.

10:07.641 --> 10:11.681
Please, the door just
closed on its own!

10:11.716 --> 10:15.721
Nevertheless, the Tardis is a weapon.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.520
What are you doing? Bring it back!

10:26.480 --> 10:28.406
Doctor!

10:28.441 --> 10:30.485
What've you done, where's it going?!

10:30.520 --> 10:35.040
The Crucible
has a heart of Z-Neutrino Energy.

10:35.075 --> 10:38.597
The Tardis will be deposited
into the core.

10:38.632 --> 10:42.120
You can't,
you've taken the defences down,

10:42.155 --> 10:43.681
it'll be torn apart!

11:01.161 --> 11:03.361
But Donna's still in there!
Let her go!

11:06.040 --> 11:09.960
The female and the Tardis
will perish together.

11:09.995 --> 11:12.325
Observe!

11:12.360 --> 11:17.401
The last child of Gallifrey
is powerless.

11:22.401 --> 11:24.925
Please,
I'm begging you, I'll do anything!

11:24.960 --> 11:29.961
Put me in her place, you can do
anything to me, I don't care,
just get her out of there!

12:00.721 --> 12:04.200
You are connected to the Tardis.

12:04.235 --> 12:07.081
Now feel it die!

12:37.320 --> 12:39.321
It's you. Oh, yes!

12:41.481 --> 12:44.401
You're naked. Oh, yes!

12:45.321 --> 12:49.360
Total Tardis destruction
in ten rels,

12:49.395 --> 12:53.080
nine, eight, seven,

12:53.115 --> 12:55.518
six, five,

12:55.553 --> 12:58.196
four, three,

12:58.231 --> 13:00.805
two, one...

13:00.840 --> 13:03.201
The Tardis has been destroyed.

13:03.236 --> 13:06.158
Now tell me, Doctor.

13:06.193 --> 13:09.081
What do you feel?

13:09.116 --> 13:10.898
Anger?

13:10.933 --> 13:12.626
Sorrow?

13:12.661 --> 13:14.320
Despair?

13:16.001 --> 13:17.286
Yeah.

13:17.321 --> 13:21.761
Then if emotions are so important,

13:21.796 --> 13:24.280
surely we have enhanced you?

13:24.315 --> 13:26.878
Yeah? Feel this!

13:26.913 --> 13:29.177
Exterminate!

13:29.212 --> 13:31.441
Aaaargh!

13:33.241 --> 13:35.606
Jack!

13:35.641 --> 13:37.606
Oh, my God! Oh, no!

13:37.641 --> 13:40.886
Rose, come here, leave him.

13:40.921 --> 13:44.961
They killed him. I know. I'm sorry.

13:44.996 --> 13:47.218
Escort them to the Vault.

13:47.253 --> 13:49.406
There's nothing we can do.

13:49.441 --> 13:52.921
They are the playthings
of Davros now.

14:03.040 --> 14:07.725
All repaired. Lovely. Ssh! No-one
knows we're here. Gotta keep quiet.

14:07.760 --> 14:11.841
Silent running, like on submarines!
Don't drop a spanner. I like blue.
What d'you think?

14:11.876 --> 14:14.125
You are bonkers!

14:14.160 --> 14:18.880
What's wrong with blue? Is that what
Time Lords do? Lop a bit off, grow
another? You're like worms! No.

14:18.915 --> 14:23.561
I'm unique. Never been another
like me. Cos all that regeneration
energy went into the hand.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.760
Look at my hand! I love that hand!
But then you touched it, wham!

14:26.795 --> 14:30.040
Ssh! Instantaneous
biological metacrisis.

14:30.075 --> 14:33.445
I grew...out of you.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.921
space man! Oi! Watch it, Earth girl!

14:36.956 --> 14:39.401
Oh...I sound like you.

14:40.641 --> 14:43.881
I sound all sort of...rough. Oi!

14:43.916 --> 14:46.246
Oi! Oi! Spanners! Ssh!

14:46.281 --> 14:49.840
I must've picked up a bit of your
voice, that's all. Is it? Did I? No!

14:49.875 --> 14:53.457
Oh, you are kidding me, no way.

14:53.492 --> 14:56.446
One heart. I've got one heart!

14:56.481 --> 14:59.400
This body has got only one heart!

14:59.435 --> 15:01.766
What?

15:01.801 --> 15:04.445
What, like you're human?

15:04.480 --> 15:08.240
Oh, that's disgusting. Oi!
Oi! Stop it!

15:08.275 --> 15:12.801
No, wait,

15:14.440 --> 15:19.500
Well, isn't that wizard?
I kept hearing that noise,
that heartbeat...

15:19.535 --> 15:24.560
That was my single heart. Cos I'm a
complicated event in time and space,

15:24.595 --> 15:28.041
must have rippled back.
Converging on you. But why me?

15:28.076 --> 15:31.521
Cos you're special.
I keep telling you, I'm not!

15:31.556 --> 15:32.720
No, but you are.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.205
Oh.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.280
You really don't believe that,
do you?

15:40.880 --> 15:42.845
I can see, Donna.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.360
What you're thinking.
All that attitude. All that lip.

15:46.395 --> 15:49.977
Cos all this time...
you think you're not worth it.

15:50.012 --> 15:53.560
Stop it. Shouting at the world.
Cos no-one's listening.

15:53.595 --> 15:56.058
Well, why should they? Doctor.

15:56.093 --> 15:58.521
Stop it. But look at what you did.

15:58.556 --> 16:02.200
No, it's more than that,

16:02.235 --> 16:03.321
it's like...

16:04.761 --> 16:06.761
..we were always heading for this.

16:12.521 --> 16:14.565
Your granddad! Your car.

16:14.600 --> 16:19.641
Donna, your car, you parked your car
right where the Tardis was going
to land, that's not coincidence!

16:19.676 --> 16:23.641
We've been blind.
Something's been drawing us together
for such a long time.

16:23.676 --> 16:26.045
But you're talking like...destiny.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.846
There's no such thing, is there?
It's still not finished.

16:29.881 --> 16:35.241
It's like the pattern's not complete,
the strands are still
drawing together.

16:35.276 --> 16:37.720
But heading for what?

16:42.560 --> 16:44.285
Hier ist niemand.

16:44.320 --> 16:47.006
Was immer Sie wollen,
gehen Sie fort.

16:47.041 --> 16:51.685
Lassen Sie mich in Ruhe.
Ich heisse Martha Jones.
Ich komme von UNIT.

16:51.720 --> 16:57.081
Agentin funf sechs sechs sieben
eins, von der medizinicshen
Abteilung. Es hiess Sie kamen vorbei.

16:57.116 --> 17:02.645
That accent, that is London, ja?
I went to London.

17:02.680 --> 17:07.881
Long time ago. I thought this place
was supposed to be guarded.
They were soldiers. Boys.

17:07.915 --> 17:09.964
I brought them food, every day.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.961
But when der Albtraum came from
the sky... They went home to die.

17:13.996 --> 17:16.880
But not you? I've got a job to do.

17:41.401 --> 17:44.241
London, in those days. To see it!

17:44.276 --> 17:47.081
So much glamour. I was so young.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.001
I heard the soldiers talking.

17:51.036 --> 17:52.885
Many times.

17:52.920 --> 17:55.080
They would speak of
the Osterhagen Key.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.521
I think London must be changed now,
yes?

18:00.556 --> 18:02.121
But still...the glamour.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.200
You will not go.

18:08.235 --> 18:10.726
I've got no choice.

18:10.761 --> 18:14.160
I know the Key. What it does.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.880
Sie sind der Albtraum.
Nicht die anderen, Sie!

18:20.641 --> 18:25.441
Ich sollte Sie umbringen,
am besten gleich jetzt!

18:25.476 --> 18:27.081
Then do it.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.045
Martha...

18:37.080 --> 18:39.801
Zur Hoelle mit Dir!

18:42.201 --> 18:44.525
I know.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.601
Commence disposal. Incinerate!

18:53.560 --> 18:56.001
Disposal completed.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.960
This is Osterhagen Station One.
My name is Martha Jones.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.761
Is there anyone there? Over.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.960
Prisoners now on board the Crucible!

19:38.995 --> 19:40.977
They will be taken for testing!

19:41.012 --> 19:42.960
One step closer to the Doctor.

19:48.201 --> 19:50.641
Activate the Holding Cells.

19:53.961 --> 19:55.966
Excellent.

19:56.001 --> 20:00.560
Even when powerless,
a Time Lord is best contained.

20:00.595 --> 20:02.777
Still scared of me, then?

20:02.812 --> 20:04.960
It is time we talked, Doctor.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.045
After so very long.

20:07.080 --> 20:11.161
No, we're not doing the nostalgia
tour, I want to know what's
happening, right here, right now,

20:11.196 --> 20:13.641
cos the Supreme Dalek
said Vault, yeah?

20:13.676 --> 20:16.000
As in dungeon, cellar?

20:16.035 --> 20:17.726
Prison?

20:17.761 --> 20:20.005
You're not in charge of
the Daleks, are you?

20:20.040 --> 20:25.840
They've got you locked away down
here in the basement like, what,
a servant? A slave?

20:25.875 --> 20:28.045
Court jester? We have...

20:28.080 --> 20:33.840
an arrangement. No, no, no, no,
I've got the word.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.366
You're the Dalek's pet!

20:35.401 --> 20:39.326
So very full of fire, is he not?

20:39.361 --> 20:43.161
And to think you crossed
entire universes,

20:43.196 --> 20:46.966
to find him again.

20:47.001 --> 20:50.760
Leave her alone.
She is mine, to do as I please.

20:50.795 --> 20:52.486
Then why am I still alive?

20:52.521 --> 20:56.126
You must be here. It was foretold.

20:56.161 --> 21:02.161
Even the Supreme Dalek
would not dare to contradict
the prophecies of Dalek Caan.

21:03.321 --> 21:05.645
So cold and dark,

21:05.680 --> 21:11.041
fire is coming,
the endless flames.

21:11.076 --> 21:12.838
What is that thing?

21:12.873 --> 21:14.566
You've met before.

21:14.601 --> 21:16.561
The last of the Cult of Skaro.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.200
But it flew into the Time War,
unprotected.

21:21.235 --> 21:26.086
Caan did more than that,

21:26.121 --> 21:30.721
Its infinite complexity and majesty,
raging through his mind.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.686
And he saw you.

21:33.721 --> 21:39.321
Both of you. This I have foreseen,
in the wild, and the wind,

21:39.356 --> 21:42.726
the Doctor will be here,
as witness.

21:42.761 --> 21:48.121
At the end of everything. The Doctor
and his precious Children of Time.

21:50.841 --> 21:53.605
And one of them will die.

21:53.640 --> 21:58.321
Was it you, Caan?
Did you kill Donna? Why did
the Tardis door close, tell me!

21:58.356 --> 22:01.726
Oh, that's it! The anger!

22:01.761 --> 22:07.240
The fire! The rage of a Time Lord
who butchered millions!

22:07.275 --> 22:10.601
There he is!

22:11.761 --> 22:13.926
Why so shy?

22:13.961 --> 22:16.081
Show your companion.

22:16.116 --> 22:18.166
Show her your true self.

22:18.201 --> 22:21.780
Dalek Caan has promised me that,
too.

22:21.815 --> 22:25.608
I have seen. At the time of ending.

22:25.643 --> 22:29.366
The Doctor's soul will be revealed.

22:29.401 --> 22:33.241
What does that mean?
We will discover it together.

22:33.276 --> 22:35.366
Our final journey.

22:35.401 --> 22:38.480
Because the ending approaches,

22:38.515 --> 22:40.358
the testing begins!

22:40.393 --> 22:42.201
Testing of what?

22:44.841 --> 22:46.681
The Reality Bomb.

22:49.481 --> 22:54.320
Prisoners will stand
in the designated area!

22:54.355 --> 22:56.681
Move! Move!

23:02.041 --> 23:03.406
Ohh!

23:03.441 --> 23:06.285
You will stand!

23:06.320 --> 23:09.601
I can't... You will stand!

23:09.636 --> 23:11.606
I can't. Please!

23:11.641 --> 23:14.360
On your feet. On your feet!

23:14.395 --> 23:15.658
Mickey.

23:15.693 --> 23:16.886
Mickey.

23:16.921 --> 23:22.000
Jackie! Prisoners will stand
in the designated area!

23:22.035 --> 23:24.680
We can't just leave her!
No, Mickey, wait!

23:28.561 --> 23:32.361
What does it mean? What are they
testing, what are they gonna do?

23:35.481 --> 23:38.486
I reckon it's that thing there.

23:38.521 --> 23:42.001
Testing calibration
of Reality Bomb!

23:42.036 --> 23:45.321
Firing in ten rels, nine,

23:45.356 --> 23:47.726
eight, seven...

23:47.761 --> 23:53.080
Behold the apotheosis of my genius!

23:53.115 --> 23:55.966
..two, one, zero...

23:56.001 --> 23:59.081
Activate planetary alignment field!

24:03.081 --> 24:06.721
It's the planets. The 27 planets!

24:15.880 --> 24:18.125
But that's Z-Neutrino Energy...

24:18.160 --> 24:22.160
Flattened by the alignment of
the planets into a single string.
No! Davros!

24:22.195 --> 24:23.837
Davros, you can't!

24:23.872 --> 24:25.445
YOU CAN'T! No!

24:25.480 --> 24:28.681
Single-string Z-Neutrinos
compressed into...

24:30.081 --> 24:31.941
No.

24:31.976 --> 24:33.801
No way!

24:54.841 --> 24:57.921
30 minutes...it's recharged!

25:08.720 --> 25:10.321
I'm so sorry.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.080
Test completed.

25:42.115 --> 25:44.405
What was it?

25:44.440 --> 25:47.841
Doctor? What did it do?

25:50.361 --> 25:55.220
Doctor? What happened?
Electrical energy, Miss Tyler.

25:55.255 --> 26:00.080
Every atom in existence
is bound by an electrical field.

26:00.115 --> 26:02.480
The Reality Bomb cancels it out.

26:02.515 --> 26:05.125
Structure falls apart.

26:05.160 --> 26:09.005
That test was focused on the
prisoners alone.

26:09.040 --> 26:16.120
Full transmission will dissolve
every form of matter.

26:16.155 --> 26:17.721
Stars are going out.

26:17.756 --> 26:19.325
The 27 planets.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.160
They become one vast transmitter.

26:22.195 --> 26:24.857
Blasting that wavelength...

26:24.892 --> 26:27.485
Across the entire universe.

26:27.520 --> 26:31.320
Never stopping, never faltering,
never fading.

26:31.355 --> 26:35.085
People and planets and stars
will become dust,

26:35.120 --> 26:40.120
and the dust will become atoms,
and the atoms will become...nothing.

26:40.155 --> 26:42.925
And the wavelength will continue,

26:42.960 --> 26:47.041
breaking through the Rift
at the heart of the Medusa Cascade

26:47.076 --> 26:49.281
into every dimension,

26:49.316 --> 26:51.046
every parallel,

26:51.081 --> 26:55.500
every single corner of creation!

26:55.535 --> 26:59.920
This is my ultimate victory, Doctor!

26:59.955 --> 27:02.697
The destruction...

27:02.732 --> 27:05.405
of reality itself!

27:05.440 --> 27:08.246
Prepare for universal detonation!

27:08.281 --> 27:10.885
The fleet will gather
at the Crucible!

27:10.920 --> 27:16.360
All Daleks will return
to shelter from the cataclysm!

27:16.395 --> 27:21.166
We will become the only life forms
in existence!

27:21.201 --> 27:26.800
They're leaving! Dad, the Daleks
are going! Going where, though?

27:26.835 --> 27:29.157
And Donna's still out there.

27:29.192 --> 27:31.480
It's not over yet, sweetheart.

27:44.761 --> 27:50.521
Just my luck. I climb through
two miles of ventilation shafts,
chasing life signs on this thing...

27:50.556 --> 27:53.206
And who do I find? Mickey Mouse.

27:53.241 --> 27:56.921
You can talk, Captain Cheesecake!
Ha ha ha!

27:56.956 --> 28:00.601
Good to see you...
and that's beefcake.

28:00.636 --> 28:01.961
And that's enough hugging.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.805
We meet at last, Miss Smith.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.041
There is something we can do.
You've got to understand.

28:10.076 --> 28:11.800
I have a son down there on Earth.

28:11.835 --> 28:14.480
He's only 14 years old.

28:14.515 --> 28:17.005
I've brought this.

28:17.040 --> 28:20.920
It was given to me
by a Verron Soothsayer. He said...

28:20.955 --> 28:23.440
"This is for the End of Days."

28:25.641 --> 28:27.806
Is that a Warp Star?

28:27.841 --> 28:30.526
Gonna tell me what a Warp Star is?

28:30.561 --> 28:33.400
A warpfold conjugation
trapped in a carbonised shell.

28:33.435 --> 28:35.281
It's an explosion, Mickey.

28:36.521 --> 28:38.806
An explosion waiting to happen.

28:38.841 --> 28:42.925
This is Osterhagen Station Five.
Are you receiving, Station One?

28:42.960 --> 28:48.481
I've got you. That makes three of us.
Three is all we need. My name is
Anna Zhou, what's yours?

28:48.516 --> 28:50.958
Martha Jones.
What about you, Station Four?

28:50.993 --> 28:53.401
You never said.
I don't want my name on this.

28:53.436 --> 28:56.658
Given what we're about to do.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.880
So what happens now? Do we do it?

28:59.915 --> 29:01.205
No. Not yet.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.565
UNIT instructions say, once three
Osterhagen Stations are online...

29:04.600 --> 29:09.845
I've got a higher authority,
way above UNIT. And there's one more
thing the Doctor would do.

29:09.880 --> 29:15.361
What's this thing? Our only hope,
a Z-Neutrino biological inversion
catalyser. Earth girl, remember?

29:15.396 --> 29:19.418
Davros built those Daleks
from himself. His genetic code
runs through the race.

29:19.453 --> 29:23.440
If I can lock the Crucible's
transmission onto Davros...
It destroys the Daleks!

29:23.475 --> 29:25.240
Biggest backfire in history!

29:25.275 --> 29:27.117
Incoming transmission!

29:27.152 --> 29:28.960
Origin Planet Earth.

29:28.995 --> 29:31.366
Display!

29:31.401 --> 29:36.481
This is Martha Jones, representing
the Unified Intelligence Taskforce,
on behalf of the Human Race.

29:36.516 --> 29:41.286
Send transmission to the Vault.
Continue to monitor.

29:41.321 --> 29:44.761
This message is for the Dalek
Crucible, repeat, can you hear me?

29:44.796 --> 29:49.765
Put me through.
It begins. As Dalek Caan foretold.

29:49.800 --> 29:55.081
The Children of Time will gather.
And one of them will die.

29:55.116 --> 29:57.200
Stop saying that! Put me through!

29:57.235 --> 29:59.006
Doctor.

29:59.041 --> 30:01.325
I'm sorry. I had to...

30:01.360 --> 30:04.140
Oh, but the Doctor is powerless.

30:04.175 --> 30:06.468
My prisoner! State your intent.

30:06.503 --> 30:08.726
I've got the Osterhagen Key.

30:08.761 --> 30:12.360
Leave this planet and its people
alone. Or I'll use it.

30:12.395 --> 30:14.445
Osterhagen what?
What's an Osterhagen Key?!

30:14.480 --> 30:20.681
There's a chain of 25 nuclear
warheads, placed in strategic points
beneath the Earth's crust.

30:20.716 --> 30:22.998
If I use the key...they detonate.

30:23.033 --> 30:25.246
And the Earth gets ripped apart.

30:25.281 --> 30:30.640
What?! Who invented that?!
Well, someone called Osterhagen,
I suppose. Martha, are you insane?

30:30.675 --> 30:36.801
The Osterhagen Key is to be
used...if the suffering of
the Human Race is so great,

30:36.836 --> 30:39.405
so without hope,

30:39.440 --> 30:41.680
that this becomes the final option.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.245
That's never an option!

30:43.280 --> 30:46.366
Don't argue with me, Doctor!
Cos it's more than that.

30:46.401 --> 30:51.201
Now, I reckon the Daleks need
these 27 planets for something,
but what if it becomes 26?

30:51.236 --> 30:54.960
What happens then? Daleks?
Would you risk it?

30:54.995 --> 30:56.765
She's good.

30:56.800 --> 31:00.441
- Who's that?
- My name's Rose. Rose Tyler.

31:00.476 --> 31:02.618
Oh, my God!

31:02.653 --> 31:04.761
He found you.

31:06.921 --> 31:09.360
Second transmission, internal!

31:09.395 --> 31:11.046
Display!

31:11.081 --> 31:17.481
Captain Jack Harkness,
calling all Dalek boys and girls,
are you receiving me?

31:17.516 --> 31:20.681
Don't send in your goons,
or I'll set this thing off!

31:20.716 --> 31:22.685
He's still alive!

31:22.720 --> 31:26.966
Captain, what are you doing?

31:27.001 --> 31:32.440
I've got a Warp Star wired into
the mainframe. I break this shell,
the entire Crucible goes up.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.446
You can't! Where did you get
a Warp Star?! From me.

31:35.481 --> 31:38.401
We had no choice. We saw
what happened to the prisoners.

31:38.436 --> 31:42.160
Impossible. That face.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.606
Davros?

31:47.641 --> 31:50.001
It's been quite a while.

31:50.036 --> 31:52.898
Sarah Jane Smith, remember?

31:52.933 --> 31:55.725
Oh, this is meant to be!

31:55.760 --> 31:58.006
The Circle of Time is closing.

31:58.041 --> 32:03.366
You were there, on Skaro, at
the very beginning of my creation.

32:03.401 --> 32:08.720
And I've learnt how to fight since
then. Let the Doctor go, or this
Warp Star gets opened. I'll do it!

32:08.755 --> 32:10.445
Don't imagine I wouldn't.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.321
Now that's what I call a ransom!

32:14.800 --> 32:16.085
Doctor?

32:16.120 --> 32:19.846
And the prophecy unfolds.

32:19.881 --> 32:23.401
The Doctor's soul is revealed.
Ha-ha-ha!

32:23.436 --> 32:27.178
See him! See the heart of him!

32:27.213 --> 32:30.921
The man who abhors violence.

32:30.956 --> 32:32.806
Never carrying a gun.

32:32.841 --> 32:35.006
But this is the truth, Doctor!

32:35.041 --> 32:40.241
You take ordinary people
and you fashion THEM into weapons.

32:40.276 --> 32:45.441
Behold your Children of Time,
transformed into murderers.

32:45.476 --> 32:47.326
I made the Daleks, Doctor.

32:47.361 --> 32:50.125
You made this.
They're trying to help.

32:50.160 --> 32:56.401
Already, I have seen them sacrificed
today, for their beloved Doctor.

32:56.436 --> 33:01.240
The Earth woman, who fell,
opening the Subwave Network.

33:01.275 --> 33:02.925
Who was that? Harriet Jones.

33:02.960 --> 33:06.481
She gave her life to get you here.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.565
How many more? Just think!

33:13.600 --> 33:17.520
How many have died? In your name?

33:42.481 --> 33:44.126
The Doctor.

33:44.161 --> 33:47.841
The man who keeps running,
never looking back.

33:47.876 --> 33:51.058
Because he dare not, out of shame.

33:51.093 --> 33:54.241
This is my final victory, Doctor.

33:54.276 --> 33:56.601
I have shown you...

33:56.636 --> 33:57.921
yourself.

34:00.601 --> 34:02.366
Enough.

34:02.401 --> 34:05.045
Engage defence zero-five.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.321
It's the Crucible or the Earth.

34:07.356 --> 34:09.920
Transmat engaged!

34:15.639 --> 34:18.320
I've got you.
Don't move, all of you, stay still!

34:18.355 --> 34:21.840
Guard them!
On your knees, all of you!

34:21.875 --> 34:23.721
Surrender! Do as he says.

34:30.201 --> 34:31.739
Mum. I told you not to.

34:31.775 --> 34:33.280
I couldn't leave you.

34:35.360 --> 34:38.446
The final prophecy is in place.

34:38.481 --> 34:48.001
The Doctor and his children,
all gathered as witnesses!

34:48.036 --> 34:49.081
Now...

34:50.561 --> 34:53.840
..detonate the Reality Bomb!

35:02.401 --> 35:05.840
Activate planetary alignment field!

35:10.761 --> 35:14.940
Universal Reality Detonation
in 200 rels.

35:14.975 --> 35:19.120
You can't, Davros,
just listen to me!

35:19.155 --> 35:20.401
Just stop!

35:24.641 --> 35:28.365
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

35:28.400 --> 35:32.001
Nothing can stop the detonation.

35:32.036 --> 35:35.281
Nothing and no-one!

35:38.361 --> 35:41.321
Ready? Maximum power!

35:49.401 --> 35:51.760
But that's...

35:54.921 --> 35:56.645
Impossible!

36:04.120 --> 36:05.481
Brilliant!

36:14.561 --> 36:16.361
Don't!

36:25.801 --> 36:27.880
Activate Holding Cell.

36:27.915 --> 36:29.881
Doctor...

36:32.320 --> 36:34.085
I've got it.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.521
But I don't know what to do!

36:39.520 --> 36:41.161
Donna!

36:42.280 --> 36:44.440
Donna! Are you all right, Donna?

36:44.475 --> 36:46.081
Destroy the weapon.

36:48.160 --> 36:51.520
I was wrong about your warriors,
Doctor.

36:51.555 --> 36:53.805
They are pathetic!

36:53.840 --> 36:55.445
How come there's two of you?

36:55.480 --> 37:00.641
Human biological metacrisis.
Never mind that. Now we've got
no way of stopping the Reality Bomb!

37:00.676 --> 37:03.041
Detonation in 20 rels...

37:03.076 --> 37:04.445
19...

37:04.480 --> 37:06.600
Stand witness, Time Lord!

37:06.635 --> 37:08.685
Stand witness, humans!

37:08.720 --> 37:11.380
Your strategies have failed!

37:11.415 --> 37:14.006
Your weapons are useless!

37:14.041 --> 37:17.801
And, oh, the end of the universe
is come.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.761
Nine...eight...seven...

37:20.796 --> 37:23.358
six...five...

37:23.393 --> 37:25.877
four...three...

37:25.912 --> 37:28.361
two...one...

37:33.600 --> 37:39.480
Closing all Z-Neutrino relay loops
using an internalised synchronous
back-feed reversal loop.

37:39.515 --> 37:42.718
That button there!

37:42.753 --> 37:45.617
System in shutdown!

37:45.652 --> 37:48.481
Explain! Explain!

37:48.516 --> 37:50.605
EXPLAIN!!

37:50.640 --> 37:54.081
Donna, you can't even change a plug!
D'you wanna bet, Time Boy?

37:54.116 --> 37:55.441
You'll suffer for this!

37:56.641 --> 37:58.925
Aaaargh!

37:58.960 --> 38:04.800
Oh, bio-electric dampening field
with a retrogressive arc inversion?
Exterminate her!

38:04.835 --> 38:06.738
Exterminate!

38:06.773 --> 38:08.587
Exterminate!

38:08.622 --> 38:10.401
Exterminate!

38:16.841 --> 38:18.526
Weapons non-functional.

38:18.561 --> 38:21.606
Macrotransmission
of a K-filter wavelength

38:21.641 --> 38:25.881
blocking Dalek weaponry in a
self-replicating energy blindfold
matrix? How d'you work that out?

38:25.916 --> 38:27.618
You... Time Lord!

38:27.653 --> 38:29.286
Part Time Lord!

38:29.321 --> 38:33.241
Part human! Oh, yes! That was
a two-way biological metacrisis.

38:35.280 --> 38:39.045
Half Doctor, half Donna.
The DoctorDonna!

38:39.080 --> 38:42.921
Just like the Ood said, remember?
They saw it coming!

38:42.956 --> 38:45.005
The DoctorDonna!

38:45.040 --> 38:47.281
Holding Cells deactivated!

38:47.316 --> 38:49.046
Unseal the Vault.

38:49.081 --> 38:53.960
Well, don't just stand there, you
skinny boys in suits! Get to work!

38:53.995 --> 38:56.680
Stop them!
Get them away from the controls.

38:56.715 --> 38:59.120
A-A-And spin.

38:59.881 --> 39:02.245
Help me, help me!

39:02.280 --> 39:05.001
A-A-And the other way.

39:08.281 --> 39:10.006
What did you do?!

39:10.041 --> 39:14.280
Trip-stitch circuit-breaker
in the psycho-kinetic threshold
manipulator! Brilliant!

39:14.315 --> 39:18.698
Why did we never think of that?
Because you two were just
Time Lords, you dumbos,

39:18.733 --> 39:23.046
lacking that little bit of human,
that gut instinct
that comes with Planet Earth.

39:23.081 --> 39:28.120
I can think of ideas you wouldn't
dream of in a million years! The
universe has been waiting for me!

39:28.155 --> 39:31.366
Now, let's send that
trip-stitch all over the ship!

39:31.401 --> 39:35.880
Did I ever tell you? Best temp
in Chiswick, 100 words per minute!

39:35.915 --> 39:38.245
Ha!

39:38.280 --> 39:42.721
System... malfunction!
Motor casing interference!

39:42.756 --> 39:45.001
What is happening?

39:45.036 --> 39:46.840
Explain!

39:50.121 --> 39:53.001
Come on then, boys, we've got
27 planets to send home!

39:53.036 --> 39:55.338
Activate Magnetron!

39:55.373 --> 39:57.640
Stop this at once!

39:57.675 --> 39:58.805
Mickey!

39:58.840 --> 40:01.966
You will desist.

40:02.001 --> 40:04.000
Just stay where you are, mister.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.000
Out of the way!

40:09.520 --> 40:12.280
Good to see you again!
Oh, you too!

40:17.721 --> 40:20.045
Ready?

40:20.080 --> 40:21.601
And reverse!

40:27.120 --> 40:30.526
Off you go, Clom!
Back home, Adipose 3!

40:30.561 --> 40:35.481
Shallacatop, Pyrovillia and
the Lost Moon of Poosh, sorted! Ha!

40:36.561 --> 40:41.566
Ha! We need more power. Is anyone
gonna tell us what's going on?

40:41.601 --> 40:46.360
He poured his regeneration energy
into his spare hand, I touched
the hand, he grew out of that.

40:46.395 --> 40:49.406
stayed dormant in my head

40:49.441 --> 40:53.721
till the synapses got
that extra spark, kicking them
into life. Thank you, Davros!

40:58.121 --> 41:01.165
Part human, part Time Lord.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.240
And I got the best bit
of the Doctor.

41:04.275 --> 41:06.046
I got his mind!

41:06.081 --> 41:08.246
So there's three of you?
Three Doctors?

41:08.281 --> 41:10.685
I can't tell you
what I'm thinking right now.

41:10.720 --> 41:14.800
You're so unique the Time Lines
were converging on you.
A human with a Time Lord brain!

41:14.835 --> 41:17.738
But you promised me, Dalek Caan!

41:17.773 --> 41:20.641
Why did you not foresee this?

41:20.676 --> 41:23.166
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

41:23.201 --> 41:24.646
Oh, I think he did.

41:24.681 --> 41:27.581
Something's been manipulating
the Time Lines for ages.

41:27.616 --> 41:30.481
Getting Donna Noble to
the right place at the right time.

41:30.516 --> 41:33.001
This would always have happened.

41:33.036 --> 41:36.118
I only helped, Doctor.

41:36.153 --> 41:39.166
You betrayed the Daleks!

41:39.201 --> 41:44.800
I saw the Daleks. What we have done,
throughout time and space,

41:44.835 --> 41:51.080
I saw the truth of us, Creator,
and I decreed, "No more!"

41:51.115 --> 41:54.281
I will descend...to the Vault!

41:55.600 --> 42:00.206
Heads up!
Davros! You have betrayed us!

42:00.241 --> 42:02.841
It was Dalek Caan.
The Vault will be purged!

42:02.876 --> 42:06.361
You will all be exterminated!

42:09.480 --> 42:12.481
Like I was saying. Feel this!

42:16.281 --> 42:19.600
We've lost the Magnetron!
And there's only one planet left!

42:19.635 --> 42:22.761
Guess which one?
But we can use the Tardis.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.600
Holding Earth stability.
Maintaining atmospheric shell.

42:29.635 --> 42:31.841
The prophecy must complete.

42:31.876 --> 42:33.246
Don't listen to him!

42:33.281 --> 42:36.641
I have seen the end of everything,
Dalek,

42:36.676 --> 42:39.846
and you must make it happen,
Doctor.

42:39.881 --> 42:46.401
He's right. Cos with or without a
Reality Bomb, this Dalek Empire's
big enough to slaughter the cosmos.

42:46.436 --> 42:49.481
They've got to be stopped.
Just wait for the Doctor.

42:49.516 --> 42:51.725
I am the Doctor!

42:51.760 --> 42:55.161
Maximising Dalekenium power feeds!
Blasting them back!

43:12.560 --> 43:13.965
What have you done?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.961
Fulfilling the prophecy.

43:28.240 --> 43:29.761
There goes the Time Lock!

43:35.241 --> 43:38.361
D'you know what you've done?
Now get in the Tardis!

43:40.761 --> 43:43.126
Everyone! All of you, inside!

43:43.161 --> 43:45.921
Run! In! In! In! In!
Sarah Jane! Rose!

43:45.956 --> 43:49.240
Jackie! Jack! Mickey!

43:56.481 --> 43:58.961
Davros! Come with me!

43:58.996 --> 44:01.406
I promise I can save you.

44:01.441 --> 44:04.561
Never forget, Doctor. You did this!

44:04.596 --> 44:07.885
I name you, forever...

44:07.920 --> 44:12.201
you are the Destroyer of the Worlds!

44:12.236 --> 44:14.960
Aaaargh!

44:16.920 --> 44:19.520
One will still die.

44:23.800 --> 44:27.121
And...off we go.

44:37.840 --> 44:39.760
But what about the Earth? It's
stuck in the wrong part of space!

44:39.795 --> 44:41.566
I'm on it! Torchwood Hub!

44:41.601 --> 44:45.520
This is the Doctor!
Are you receiving me?
Loud and clear! Is Jack there?

44:45.555 --> 44:49.438
Can't get rid of him!
Jack, what's her name? Gwen Cooper.

44:49.473 --> 44:53.321
Tell me, Gwen Cooper, are you
from an old Cardiff family?

44:53.356 --> 44:55.885
Yes, all the way back to the 1800s!

44:55.920 --> 45:00.205
Thought so, spatial genetic
multiplicity, funny old world.

45:00.240 --> 45:03.321
Torchwood,
open that Rift Manipulator.
Send all the power to me.

45:03.356 --> 45:06.005
Doing it now, sir! What's that for?

45:06.040 --> 45:09.520
It's a tow-rope. Sarah, what was
your son's name? He's called Luke.

45:09.555 --> 45:11.285
The computer's called Mr Smith.

45:11.320 --> 45:15.241
Calling Luke and Mr Smith.
This is the Doctor.
Come on Luke, shake your leg.

45:15.560 --> 45:20.640
Is Mum there? Oh, she's fine and
dandy. Now Mr Smith, I want you to
harness the Rift Power and loop it

45:20.675 --> 45:26.200
around the Tardis, you got that?
I regret, I will need remote access
to Tardis basecode numerals.

45:26.235 --> 45:29.121
Oh, blimey, that's gonna take
a while. No, no, no, let me!

45:30.681 --> 45:34.521
K9! Out you come!
Affirmative, Mistress!

45:34.556 --> 45:36.525
Oh, good dog!

45:36.560 --> 45:39.580
K9, give Mr Smith the basecode!
Master!

45:39.615 --> 45:42.601
Tardis basecode now
being transferred.

45:42.636 --> 45:44.326
The process is simple!

45:44.361 --> 45:49.005
Now then, you lot... Sarah, hold
that down. Mickey, you hold that.

45:49.040 --> 45:54.120
D'you know why this Tardis always
rattles about? Rose, that, there.
It's designed to have six pilots.

45:54.155 --> 45:59.201
I do it single handed! Martha,
keep that level. But not any more!
Jack, there you go, steady that...

45:59.236 --> 46:00.845
Now we can fly this thing...

46:00.880 --> 46:04.521
No, Jackie, no, no, not you,
don't touch anything, just...

46:04.556 --> 46:07.406
stand back.
..Like it's meant to be flown!

46:07.441 --> 46:10.680
We've got the Torchwood Rift looped
around the Tardis by Mr Smith,

46:10.715 --> 46:13.081
and we're gonna
fly Planet Earth back home!

46:15.481 --> 46:17.121
Right then! Off we go!

47:24.321 --> 47:27.321
That's really good, Jack.
I think you're the best.

48:40.161 --> 48:45.841
You know, you act like such
a lonely man. But look at you.

48:45.876 --> 48:48.281
You've got the biggest family
on Earth!

48:54.320 --> 48:56.566
Gotta go. He's only 14.

48:56.601 --> 49:00.121
It's a long story. And thank you!

49:05.761 --> 49:08.241
Yeah, I'm fine, are you all right?

49:10.320 --> 49:12.365
I'm gonna miss you.

49:12.400 --> 49:16.841
More than anyone. What d'you mean?
The Doctor's going to take us home,
isn't he?

49:16.876 --> 49:18.561
Well, that's the point.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.800
I told you.

49:24.835 --> 49:26.925
No teleport!

49:26.960 --> 49:30.880
And Martha, get rid of
that Osterhagen thing, eh?

49:30.915 --> 49:32.560
Save the world one more time.

49:32.595 --> 49:34.921
Consider it done.

49:39.560 --> 49:42.640
You know, I'm not sure
about UNIT these days.

49:42.675 --> 49:45.721
Maybe there's something else
you could be doing.

49:48.481 --> 49:50.526
Oi, where are you going?

49:50.561 --> 49:53.365
I'm not stupid.
I can work out what happens next.

49:53.400 --> 49:57.321
And hey, I had a good time
in that parallel world,
but my gran passed away.

49:57.356 --> 50:00.681
Nice and peaceful. She spent her
last years living in a mansion!

50:00.716 --> 50:03.601
There's nothing there for me now,
certainly not Rose.

50:03.636 --> 50:06.125
What will you do?

50:06.160 --> 50:09.161
Anything! Brand new life!

50:09.196 --> 50:10.960
Just you watch.

50:12.361 --> 50:13.526
See you, boss.

50:13.561 --> 50:18.040
Hey, you two! Oh, I thought
I'd got rid of you.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.440
Just time for one last trip.

50:30.281 --> 50:32.680
Darlig Ulv Stranden.

50:32.715 --> 50:35.080
Better known as...

50:50.280 --> 50:52.080
Well, fat lot of good this is!

50:52.115 --> 50:53.846
Back of beyond. Bloody Norway!

50:53.881 --> 50:57.860
I'm going to have to phone your
father, he's on the nursery run.

50:57.895 --> 51:01.840
I was pregnant, do you remember?
Had a baby boy. Ah, brilliant.

51:01.875 --> 51:04.120
What did you call him? Doctor.

51:05.200 --> 51:09.526
Really? No, you plum!
He's called Tony.

51:09.561 --> 51:13.085
Hold on. This is the parallel
universe, right? You're back home.

51:13.120 --> 51:19.560
The walls of the world are closing
again, now the Reality Bomb never
happened. Dimensional retroclosure.

51:19.595 --> 51:22.366
See, I really get that stuff now.

51:22.401 --> 51:26.121
I spent all that time trying
to find you. I'm not going back now.

51:26.156 --> 51:27.605
But you've got to.

51:27.640 --> 51:32.281
Cos we saved the universe,
but at a cost, and the cost is him.

51:33.720 --> 51:36.286
He destroyed the Daleks.
He committed genocide.

51:36.321 --> 51:39.085
He's too dangerous to be left
on his own. You made me.

51:39.120 --> 51:43.201
Exactly. You were born in battle.
Full of blood and anger and revenge.

51:44.720 --> 51:46.601
Remind you of someone?

51:49.401 --> 51:52.321
That's me, when we first met.

51:54.721 --> 51:56.806
And you made me better.

51:56.841 --> 51:58.961
Now you can do the same for him.

51:58.996 --> 52:01.081
But he's not you. He needs you.

52:01.116 --> 52:03.481
That's very me.

52:04.440 --> 52:08.601
But it's better than that,
though. Don't you see
what he's trying to give you?

52:08.636 --> 52:09.801
Tell her, go on.

52:13.281 --> 52:15.245
I look like him. I think like him.

52:15.280 --> 52:18.460
Same memories, same thoughts,
same everything,

52:18.495 --> 52:21.641
except I've only got one heart.
Which means?

52:21.676 --> 52:24.605
I'm part human.

52:24.640 --> 52:32.161
Specifically, the ageing part.
I'll grow old and never regenerate.
I've only got one life, Rose Tyler.

52:34.601 --> 52:38.101
I could spend it with you...
if you want.

52:38.136 --> 52:41.601
You'll grow old...
at the same time as me?

52:41.636 --> 52:43.401
Together.

52:55.840 --> 53:00.601
We've got to go, this reality
is sealing itself off...

53:00.636 --> 53:01.965
for ever.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.201
But...it's still not right.

53:05.281 --> 53:09.040
Cos the Doctor's...still you.

53:09.075 --> 53:11.726
And I'm him! All right.

53:11.761 --> 53:13.921
Both of you. Answer me this.

53:15.920 --> 53:20.681
When I last stood on this beach,
on the worst day of my life,

53:20.716 --> 53:23.481
what was the last thing
you said to me?

53:23.516 --> 53:25.761
Go on, say it.

53:27.321 --> 53:29.885
I said, "Rose Tyler."

53:29.920 --> 53:32.521
Yeah, and how was
that sentence gonna end?

53:34.360 --> 53:36.041
Does it need saying?

53:39.001 --> 53:40.480
And you, Doctor?

53:42.640 --> 53:45.360
What was the end of that sentence?

54:31.880 --> 54:34.960
I thought we could try
the planet Felspoon! Just cos...

54:34.995 --> 54:36.566
What a good name! Felspoon!

54:36.601 --> 54:41.325
Apparently, it's got mountains
that sway in the breeze and move,
can you imagine?

54:41.360 --> 54:46.120
And how d'you know that?
Because it's in your head. And if
it's in your head, it's in mine!

54:46.155 --> 54:48.646
And how does that feel? Brilliant!

54:48.681 --> 54:52.165
Fantastic! Molto bene! Great big
universe, packed into my brain!

54:52.200 --> 54:55.766
You could fix that chameleon circuit
if you hotbind the fragment-links

54:55.801 --> 55:00.840
and supersede the binary, binary,
binary, binary, binary, binary,
binary, binary, binary,

55:00.875 --> 55:02.765
binary, binary...I'm fine!

55:02.800 --> 55:08.045
Nah, never mind Felspoon.
Know who I'd like to meet?
Charlie Chaplin! shall we do that?

55:08.080 --> 55:12.681
Shall we go see Charlie Chaplin?
Charlie Chaplin? Charlie Chester?
Charlie Brown, no, he's fiction,

55:12.716 --> 55:15.721
friction, fixing, mixing,
Rickston, Brixton...

55:18.321 --> 55:20.166
Oh, my God!

55:20.201 --> 55:22.801
D'you know what's happening?

55:26.841 --> 55:31.681
Yeah. There's never been
a Human/Time Lord metacrisis
before now.

55:33.321 --> 55:34.925
And you know why.

55:34.960 --> 55:37.281
Because there can't be.

55:40.081 --> 55:41.661
I want to stay.

55:41.696 --> 55:43.206
Look at me.

55:43.241 --> 55:46.201
Donna. Look at me.

55:49.800 --> 55:54.001
I was gonna be with you.

55:54.036 --> 55:55.938
Forever.

55:55.973 --> 55:57.841
I know.

55:59.001 --> 56:01.600
Rest of my life.

56:01.635 --> 56:04.017
Travelling.

56:04.052 --> 56:06.006
In the Tardis.

56:06.041 --> 56:07.960
The DoctorDonna.

56:12.121 --> 56:13.121
Oh!

56:14.761 --> 56:17.521
Oh, but I...I can't go back.

56:19.280 --> 56:20.885
Don't make me go back.

56:20.920 --> 56:25.481
Doctor, please,
please don't make me go back.

56:25.516 --> 56:26.721
Donna.

56:28.161 --> 56:31.521
Oh, Donna Noble. I am so sorry.

56:34.121 --> 56:37.320
But we had the best of times.

56:38.960 --> 56:40.400
The best.

56:45.121 --> 56:48.040
Goodbye. No, no, no, please!

56:48.075 --> 56:50.320
Please, no, no!

56:57.361 --> 56:58.920
No!

57:07.720 --> 57:10.800
That must be her! Donna?

57:14.361 --> 57:16.841
Help me. Donna?

57:18.120 --> 57:19.600
Donna?

57:28.801 --> 57:33.801
She took my mind into her own head.
But that's a Time Lord
consciousness.

57:33.836 --> 57:36.360
All that knowledge,
it was killing her.

57:36.395 --> 57:38.086
But she'll get better now?

57:38.121 --> 57:40.486
I had to wipe her mind completely.

57:40.521 --> 57:46.881
Every trace of me, or the Tardis,
anything we did together,
anywhere we went...had to go.

57:46.916 --> 57:49.200
All those wonderful things she did.

57:49.235 --> 57:51.685
I know.

57:51.720 --> 57:53.801
But that version of Donna is dead.

57:55.401 --> 57:58.320
Cos if she remembers,
just for a second, she'll burn up.

57:58.355 --> 57:59.920
You can never tell her.

58:01.561 --> 58:04.521
You can't mention me or any of it...

58:04.556 --> 58:06.605
for the rest of her life.

58:06.640 --> 58:11.600
The whole world's talking about it,
we travelled across space.

58:11.635 --> 58:13.281
It'll just be a story.

58:14.480 --> 58:18.480
One of those Donna Noble stories
where she missed it all again.

58:18.515 --> 58:20.558
But she was better with you.

58:20.593 --> 58:22.566
Don't say that. No, she was.

58:22.601 --> 58:26.680
I just want you to know
there are worlds out there,

58:26.715 --> 58:29.041
safe in the sky, because of her.

58:30.281 --> 58:33.801
That there are people
living in the light,

58:33.836 --> 58:36.878
and singing songs of Donna Noble,

58:36.913 --> 58:39.920
a thousand million light years away.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.920
They will never forget her...

58:46.360 --> 58:49.800
..while she can never remember.

58:51.920 --> 58:53.560
And for one moment...

58:56.121 --> 58:58.081
..one shining moment...

59:01.600 --> 59:05.481
..she was the most important woman
in the whole wide universe.

59:05.516 --> 59:08.845
She still is. She's my daughter.

59:08.880 --> 59:12.006
Then maybe you should tell her that
once in a while.

59:12.041 --> 59:16.801
I was asleep! On my bed! In my
clothes! Like a flippin' kid!

59:16.836 --> 59:20.680
What d'you let me do that for?
Don't mind me. Donna.

59:22.081 --> 59:23.446
John Smith.

59:23.481 --> 59:25.126
Mr Smith was just leaving.

59:25.161 --> 59:29.601
My phone's gone mad, 32 texts!
Veena's gone barmy,
she's saying planets in the sky!

59:29.636 --> 59:31.681
What have I missed now?
Nice to meet you.

59:33.161 --> 59:37.040
As I said...I think you should go.

59:44.121 --> 59:46.966
How thick d'you think I am?
Planets!

59:47.001 --> 59:53.560
That was those two-for-one lagers
you get down the offy cos you fancy
that little man with the goatee!

59:53.595 --> 59:55.637
Yes, you do. I've seen you!

59:55.672 --> 59:57.680
Donna. I was just going.

59:57.715 --> 59:59.645
Yeah, see you.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:05.521
You're wasting your time with that
one, because Susie Mair, she went on
that dating site, and she saw him...

01:00:05.556 --> 01:00:07.641
No, listen, this is important!

01:00:07.676 --> 01:00:10.325
Susie Mair wouldn't lie!

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.561
Not unless it was about calories!

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.606
Ah.

01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:18.921
You'll have quite a bit of this.

01:00:18.956 --> 01:00:20.641
Atmospheric disturbance.

01:00:20.676 --> 01:00:22.758
Still, it'll pass.

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:24.840
Everything does.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.721
Bye then, Wilfred.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.161
Oh, Doctor.

01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:37.741
What about you now?
Who have you got?

01:00:37.776 --> 01:00:40.961
I mean, all those friends of yours...

01:00:40.996 --> 01:00:43.080
They've all got someone else.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.045
Still, that's fine.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.641
I'm fine.
I'll watch out for you, sir.

01:00:49.676 --> 01:00:51.640
You can't ever tell her.

01:00:51.675 --> 01:00:53.246
No, no, no.

01:00:53.281 --> 01:00:57.081
But every night, Doctor,

01:00:57.116 --> 01:00:59.326
when it gets dark,

01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:01.520
and the stars come out,

01:01:01.555 --> 01:01:03.361
I'll look up...

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.401
..on her behalf.

01:01:07.401 --> 01:01:12.161
I'll look up at the sky...
and think of you.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.521
Thank you.
