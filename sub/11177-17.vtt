"no less than three" if it exceeds six?

You've just won the gold medal
at the sexual Special Olympics!

10:32.753 --> 10:36.814
She can't ever find you again.
Don't you see that you're so lucky?

10:36.924 --> 10:40.087
- God! How do you not s...
- What's the matter with you?

10:40.194 --> 10:44.130
- Didn't you "bag" some woman
you're never going to see again?
- Well, I screwed up.

10:44.231 --> 10:46.563
I broke a couple of my own rules last night.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.601
She knows that I'm Gob Bluth...

10:48.702 --> 10:51.569
and we got married and I just...

10:51.672 --> 10:54.539
- What?
- Well, she was a darer.

10:54.641 --> 10:57.439
She's one of those girls
who just dares you to do things.

10:57.544 --> 11:00.138
- You married her?
- I needed a dare!

11:00.247 --> 11:02.511
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>What had started as an innocent flirtation...</i>

11:02.616 --> 11:05.176

11:05.285 --> 11:08.584
<i>Unfortunately, the evening was draining...</i>

11:08.689 --> 11:11.590
<i>and the one thing they never dared each other</i>

11:11.692 --> 11:14.092
Well, guess it's time to seal the deal.

11:14.194 --> 11:16.992
Oh, wait! What time is it?
Oh, God! "Seal the deal."

11:17.097 --> 11:19.588
My seal deal! I gotta get to Sea Land.

11:19.700 --> 11:22.635
I'm selling five of their sickest seals
to a third-world zoo.

11:22.736 --> 11:26.536
- Did you say seals?
- Yes! I told you four hours ago, I sell seals!

11:26.640 --> 11:28.540
God! Do you ever listen to what I say?

11:28.642 --> 11:31.110
I'm sorry I don't memorize every word
that comes out of your mouth.

11:31.211 --> 11:34.305
Sometimes I just like to think...
think my thoughts.

11:34.414 --> 11:36.882
We'll talk about this when I get home.

11:36.984 --> 11:39.111
It was hot.

11:39.219 --> 11:41.779
Boy, the lengths you'll go
to sleep with a woman.

11:41.888 --> 11:44.789
Believe me, we didn't do any sleeping.
I had sex last night.

11:44.891 --> 11:47.485
- <i>[Narrator] But he really didn't.</i>
- Yes, I did.

11:47.594 --> 11:49.789
<i>And later, Michael arrived for his date.</i>

11:49.896 --> 11:51.830
- Hey!
- I'm so sorry that I'm late.

11:51.932 --> 11:55.129
- I thought I smelled you coming.
- Mm. Yeah, here I am.

11:55.235 --> 11:57.135
I thought so. Did you smell him?

11:57.237 --> 12:00.206
- Did you smell the handsome man, Justice?
- "Handsome."

12:00.307 --> 12:02.969
- You don't have any evidence of handsome.
- Well, that's true.

12:03.076 --> 12:05.374
But I can feel handsome.

12:05.479 --> 12:06.480
- Mmm.
- That feels handsomey. { Chuckles]

12:06.480 --> 12:08.710
- Mmm.
- That feels handsomey. { Chuckles]

12:08.815 --> 12:12.649
So you didn't get a case of"I just had
a one-night stand with a blind girl"-itus?

12:12.753 --> 12:14.983
No, of course not.
One-night stand? Please!

12:15.088 --> 12:16.988
This is our second date now.
And I wanna see...

12:17.090 --> 12:19.854
And I wanna see you again tonight, so, um...

12:19.960 --> 12:22.656
if it's a one-night stand, I'm not very good at it.

12:22.763 --> 12:25.994
But now, listen, aren't you busy with the trial?

12:26.099 --> 12:29.694
Um, yes, of course. I'm very, very busy.
But not too busy for you.

12:29.803 --> 12:31.703
Not too busy for a little walk right now maybe.

12:31.805 --> 12:33.705
I'll be your Seeing Eye dog.
What do you think?

12:33.807 --> 12:36.275
- Okay?
- Oh. Should we leaveJustice here?

12:36.376 --> 12:39.903
Um, yes. He'll be fine, won't you, boy? Huh?

12:40.013 --> 12:43.676
<i>Justice, stay.! Stay.!</i>

12:43.784 --> 12:46.344
Describe this to me, Chareth.

12:46.453 --> 12:48.853
Describe to me how beautiful the park is.

12:48.955 --> 12:52.015
Oh, I wish you could see it. It's just beautiful.

12:52.125 --> 12:55.458
There's an elderly couple walking hand in hand.

12:55.562 --> 12:57.860
- They're having a wonderful time.
- Yeah?

12:57.964 --> 13:02.765
"Already served, not to exceed six years
but no less than three..."

13:02.869 --> 13:06.737
Uh, three years is what I give them...

13:06.840 --> 13:10.071
and then one of them dies
and the other one is not too far behind.

13:10.177 --> 13:13.476
I can smell right through you, Chareth.
You're reading.

13:13.580 --> 13:15.741

you... { Beeps]

13:15.849 --> 13:18.249
- Uh, yes.
- { Chuckles] Yeah.

- Inmate Bluth.
- Yes, sir?

13:25.425 --> 13:27.325
I want you to know that last night...

13:27.427 --> 13:31.056
I watched a very impressive videotape
of the title <i>Caged Wisdom.</i>

13:31.164 --> 13:34.998
I was struck by the dual life
of the spiritual man.

13:35.102 --> 13:40.005
And I did very much enjoy the blooper bonus
footage at the end. { Laughs]

13:40.107 --> 13:42.905
Well, you know, I almost did strangle myself
on my own prayer shawl.

13:43.009 --> 13:45.068
A self-choking for the ages.

13:45.178 --> 13:48.306
- There's a Shasta can there
you seemed to have missed.
- Okay.

13:48.415 --> 13:50.315
- <i>[Narrator] Moments later, Cindi arrived.</i>
- Thank you, Warden.

13:50.417 --> 13:52.749
George! I had to see you.

13:52.853 --> 13:56.448
I'm sorry I left before. I just felt so awful.

13:56.556 --> 13:58.786
But I kept thinking about us.

13:58.892 --> 14:00.792
- Yes.
- About our future.

14:00.894 --> 14:03.260
- Yes, l...
- And I know for a fact we can have one.

14:03.363 --> 14:05.524
Okay. What evidence do they have on me?

14:05.632 --> 14:08.931
You keep talking about a fact?
You keep saying, "I know for a fact."

14:09.035 --> 14:11.503
- What fact?
- Faith.

14:11.605 --> 14:15.837
I have faith my prayers will free you.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.934
- Faith is not a fact!
- Oh, yes, it is.

14:19.045 --> 14:21.707
You said so yourself in <i>Caged Wisdom.</i>

No. Faith is a facet.

Great job. Take some more money.

14:51.778 --> 14:54.804
Look. I gotta go.
I'm going to this fund-raiser for a sick girl, okay?

<i>And later, at the courthouse</i>...

15:04.391 --> 15:07.155
- Good afternoon.
- Thank God.

15:07.260 --> 15:10.320
So did you read the plea?
We've got minutes here, not hours.

15:10.430 --> 15:13.024
I did read it. Most of it. Um, I definitely...

15:13.133 --> 15:17.001
definitely read this, uh...
the first part of this first, uh, section.

15:17.103 --> 15:19.628
- Uh, no. Did not read it.
- <i>Oh, come on, Michael.</i>

15:19.739 --> 15:21.639
<i>How many times are you going to screw up...</i>

15:21.741 --> 15:24.539
before the rest of this family
sees you for the screwup you are?

15:24.644 --> 15:26.544
I'm not the lawyer. All right?
Why didn't you read it?

15:26.646 --> 15:28.637
Excuse me.
I got busy with my other clients.

15:28.748 --> 15:30.716
- What other clients?
- He doesn't know about the divorce?

15:30.817 --> 15:33.308
- It's an annulment.
- Oh, I looked into that too.

15:33.420 --> 15:36.981
<i>You can only get an annulment</i>
<i>if you haven't consummated the marriage first.</i>

15:37.090 --> 15:40.150
Well, I guess I'll just stay married then...

15:40.260 --> 15:44.959
because we all know
that I closed that deal, right?

You and Dad are getting divorced?

15:51.304 --> 15:53.704
Oh, don't worry, sweetie.
No one is fighting over you.

15:53.807 --> 15:56.367
And don't worry about Barry reading the plea.

15:56.476 --> 15:58.444
We'll let your father rot in prison.

15:58.545 --> 16:00.513
Take the plea. We're taking the plea!

<i>We're going to trial, you're going to lose,</i>

- That's enough, Mom.
- For him? Nothing's enough.

16:07.487 --> 16:11.048
You'd think a man locked up in prison
would be able to abstain.

16:11.157 --> 16:15.389
Your father, with his disgusting tweaking!

16:15.495 --> 16:17.895
I couldn't breast-feed any of you kids

Lucille, for God's sakes. She was an informant.
She was working for the government.

<i>The only thing I was pumping her</i>
<i>for was information, honey.</i>

<i>An informant. Dad, are you crazy?</i>
<i>You're gonna blow this whole case.</i>

16:30.443 --> 16:34.539
It's blown. It's over. It's dead.
Take the plea. Get me out there.

16:34.648 --> 16:37.378
Lets take the plea, okay?
Look. It's so nice and thick.

16:37.484 --> 16:41.079
<i>Oh, George, I should have never doubted you.</i>

16:41.187 --> 16:44.156
Even when you slept with my sister,
it was for a good reason.

Got her to stop drinking, didn't it?

You can get all the information we need.

Wait a minute. How do we know it's not a trap?
Maybe she's setting you up.

18:24.624 --> 18:28.025
It's not a setup, okay? She gave me her real name.
She said that she was a lawyer.

18:28.128 --> 18:30.221
I'm the one that lied to her.
I gotta go talk to her.

- No!
- No, Michael! You can save this family.
