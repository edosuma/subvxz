WEBVTT

00:00.978 --> 00:02.230
And cut.

00:02.231 --> 00:03.280
That was great.

00:03.281 --> 00:05.376
Previously on "Famous in Love..."

00:05.377 --> 00:08.057
Congratulations Paige you
are trending on Twitter.

00:08.058 --> 00:10.572
They aren't exactly
shipping you and Jake.

00:10.573 --> 00:12.369
#PaigeSucks?

00:12.481 --> 00:14.196
Why are people hating so much?

00:14.197 --> 00:17.001
Oh, they just found out
you didn't pick Rainer.

00:17.002 --> 00:18.918
I need to talk to you in there.

00:19.668 --> 00:22.081
I thought we were going to...

00:24.118 --> 00:26.145
Rainer. You've got visitors.

00:26.176 --> 00:30.346
He's agreed to see Alan again but
he still refuses to meet with you.

00:30.347 --> 00:31.398
Unacceptable.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.189
That is your contract.

00:33.190 --> 00:36.147
Did you even bother to
read it before you signed?

00:36.267 --> 00:38.935
You're exclusive to Locked
until the films completion.

00:38.936 --> 00:40.462
You're all fired.

00:40.561 --> 00:44.214
If I have to pull the plug on Locked,
your mother's career is dead.

00:44.215 --> 00:45.436
That's her problem.

00:46.502 --> 00:48.690
My best friend Tangey Turner.

00:48.691 --> 00:52.019
- I thought this was a girls night?
- My life is an open book now.

00:52.056 --> 00:53.430
Want to get naked?

00:54.955 --> 00:56.117
Let's go.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.136 --> 01:30.136
What up? I'm gonna join you.

01:35.077 --> 01:37.178
Too late.

01:37.179 --> 01:39.245
You can hand me a towel.

01:45.053 --> 01:46.286
Thank you.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.259
Rainer's back.

02:17.285 --> 02:19.320
Hey, you're back.

02:19.321 --> 02:20.354
Oh, wait, I, I thought you weren't

02:20.355 --> 02:21.355
checkin' out yet, what happened?

02:21.356 --> 02:24.425
I had a little... encouragement.

02:24.426 --> 02:27.228
Oh, yeah. I just met her.

02:27.229 --> 02:29.029
So, is she from rehab?

02:29.030 --> 02:32.333
Yeah, she's so great.

02:32.334 --> 02:34.434
Yeah. But you're good?

02:35.437 --> 02:38.072
Yeah, I'm good.

02:38.073 --> 02:41.275
Does this mean we're going
back to work?

02:41.276 --> 02:44.478
I don't know, man. Just, just
takin' it one day at a time.

02:44.479 --> 02:46.480
Umm-hmm. Okay. 'Cause I'm here.

02:46.481 --> 02:48.248
Whatever you need.

02:51.086 --> 02:53.487
Well, we didn't really get
to meet properly.

02:53.488 --> 02:56.189
- I'm Harper.
- Nice to meet you.

02:57.259 --> 02:59.193
So I'm gonna head out.

02:59.194 --> 03:01.061
- Now?
- Yeah.

03:01.062 --> 03:03.063
My beach clean-up starts at nine.

03:03.064 --> 03:05.332
It's for my charity, Trending Ocean.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.368
I planned it months ago
and it's one of the reasons

03:07.369 --> 03:09.069
that I checked out last night.

03:09.070 --> 03:10.304
Oh, wait, I'll come with.

03:10.305 --> 03:13.140
No, please. You were in rehab
as long as I was.

03:13.141 --> 03:15.142
I'm sure you could use a day
to get your life back in order.

03:15.143 --> 03:17.110
I can do that later.

03:22.217 --> 03:24.118
I'll call you when I'm done, okay?

03:24.119 --> 03:26.020
We'll have dinner or something.

03:26.021 --> 03:27.186
Bye, Jordan.

03:30.091 --> 03:32.193
Alright, that leaves you and me.

03:32.194 --> 03:34.361
- What do you wanna do?
- Oh, I can't.

03:34.362 --> 03:37.164
Man, goin' for this Oscar noms
like a full-time job.

03:37.165 --> 03:39.433
I got four interviews before lunch.

03:39.434 --> 03:41.235
Then I have to head down
to City Block Kids.

03:41.236 --> 03:43.137
- Then another interview..
- City Block Kids.

03:43.138 --> 03:45.172
Isn't that a charity?
You have to volunteer?

03:45.173 --> 03:48.375
Yup. Gotta hit this Oscar stuff hard.

03:48.376 --> 03:50.344
Look, I'm sorry, man. If I would
have known you were comin' out...

03:50.345 --> 03:53.180
No, I get it.

03:53.181 --> 03:54.248
Get out of here.

03:54.249 --> 03:55.516
Later, I promise.

03:55.517 --> 03:57.351
I'm glad you're home, man.

03:57.352 --> 03:58.519
I missed you.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.121
The Rain man is back.

04:01.122 --> 04:02.256
He's back.

04:10.332 --> 04:13.267
Scene 17A, take three. Mark.

04:13.268 --> 04:15.335
- 'Quiet everyone.'
- And action!

04:16.271 --> 04:18.471
Quick! Let me lock the door.

04:18.473 --> 04:20.173
I took care of everything, Georgia.

04:20.175 --> 04:22.209
No one's followin' us.

04:22.210 --> 04:25.212
- Where is the boat meeting us?
- Tomorrow morning.

04:25.213 --> 04:26.380
Off Selma.

04:26.381 --> 04:28.415
Stop worrying.

04:28.416 --> 04:30.350
We got away with it.

04:34.222 --> 04:36.123
Yeah, we did.

04:36.124 --> 04:39.026
We did it, baby. We did it,
we did it, we did it.

04:39.027 --> 04:40.326
Oh, Lord!

04:42.063 --> 04:45.298
Oh, money, money, money, babe. Ah.

04:47.035 --> 04:50.403
I can't wait to make love to you
on all this money.

04:51.439 --> 04:53.140
- And cut!
- 'That's a cut.'

04:53.141 --> 04:55.042
- That was great. Nice, guys.
- 'Alright.'

04:55.043 --> 04:56.243
- How's sound?
- 'Good for sound.'

04:56.244 --> 04:58.279
Okay. We're gonna move into
single coverage of both of you.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.346
Shane, when do you have to bartend?

04:59.347 --> 05:00.314
- Uh, 2:00.
- Cool.

05:00.315 --> 05:01.315
We'll get you out of here by then.

05:01.316 --> 05:02.316
Paige, you can take a break.

05:02.317 --> 05:03.937
We're gonna do Shane's coverage first.

05:05.453 --> 05:07.354
Go, please.

05:07.355 --> 05:08.389
Come here, Mr. Director.

05:11.426 --> 05:13.192
Uh, let's take five.

05:14.029 --> 05:15.261
Real quick.

06:42.450 --> 06:43.550
Mmm.

06:53.398 --> 06:54.631
Okay, Alan.

06:54.632 --> 06:56.667
Alan, we have to go.

06:56.668 --> 06:58.569
We overslept.

06:58.570 --> 07:02.272
Though, why I am rushing back to a job

07:02.273 --> 07:03.607
that I'm about get fired from

07:03.608 --> 07:05.342
'I don't know.'

07:05.343 --> 07:07.377
Just so you know

07:07.378 --> 07:09.213
we are never doing that again.

07:09.214 --> 07:10.547
Why? That was amazing.

07:10.548 --> 07:13.517
We can't stay close for Rainer
if we're having sex.

07:13.518 --> 07:15.252
This always ends badly.

07:15.253 --> 07:16.453
I can't argue with that.

07:16.454 --> 07:18.555
Well, I'm glad we agree.

07:18.556 --> 07:22.159
I'm actually supposed to go
ring shopping for Treena today.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.193
Who?

07:23.194 --> 07:24.194
My girlfriend who I was

07:24.195 --> 07:25.495
going to make my fiancee.

07:25.496 --> 07:28.165
Oh. Well, don't let me stop you.

07:28.166 --> 07:29.433
No, you know what, you should let me

07:29.434 --> 07:31.568
help you pick out the ring.

07:31.569 --> 07:33.470
- What?
- Yeah, Alan.

07:33.471 --> 07:34.605
You have terrible taste.

07:34.606 --> 07:36.340
Your last two wives returned the rings

07:36.341 --> 07:37.541
for an upgrade, so..

07:37.542 --> 07:38.642
You know what? We can do it at lunch.

07:38.643 --> 07:40.376
I'll clear my schedule.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.413
What?

07:43.414 --> 07:45.515
You are so nuts.

07:45.516 --> 07:47.316
I love that about you.

07:48.186 --> 07:49.419
Alan, we just agreed...

07:49.420 --> 07:51.288
Yeah, but we're here, in the moment.

07:51.289 --> 07:55.291
So technically, it's still
the one and only time.

07:56.594 --> 07:59.328
You do have a good point.

08:00.164 --> 08:01.464
Yeah, you tell me.

08:05.336 --> 08:07.237
Is that your phone or mine?

08:07.238 --> 08:10.374
- I don't know.
- And I don't care.

08:11.509 --> 08:13.443
- S-stop it.
- We-we're at a hotel.

08:13.444 --> 08:15.245
- They'll never find us.
- Okay, okay, wait.

08:15.246 --> 08:16.346
Alan, Alan, something's happening.

08:16.347 --> 08:18.248
- Oh, yes, it is.
- I gotta answer the phone.

08:18.249 --> 08:19.416
What?

08:19.417 --> 08:21.217
Alright, what is it?

08:22.253 --> 08:24.421
'Oh, crap! It's "TMZ."'

08:24.422 --> 08:27.291
Rainer's out of rehab.

08:27.292 --> 08:29.293
Okay. Uh, I'll drive you.

08:29.294 --> 08:30.460
- No, uh, I'll take a taxi.
- Rainer will never know.

08:30.461 --> 08:32.195
Absolutely not showing up with you.

08:32.196 --> 08:33.376
- Alan..
- Hand me my pants.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.504
Hey, it's my favorite client.

08:40.505 --> 08:42.572
Oh, I didn't know you were
coming to my set today.

08:42.573 --> 08:45.208
Your phone's off.
Here, I got you a latte.

08:45.209 --> 08:46.510
Tsk. You didn't need
to come all the way

08:46.511 --> 08:47.611
down here to give me a latte.

08:47.612 --> 08:48.645
I didn't.

08:48.646 --> 08:50.180
Came all the way here

08:50.181 --> 08:52.382
to tell you that..

08:52.383 --> 08:54.383
...Rainer is out of rehab.

08:56.487 --> 08:58.322
Oh.

08:58.323 --> 09:01.458
Well, maybe that's a photo from rehab.

09:01.459 --> 09:03.427
Wait, is that Harper Tate?

09:03.428 --> 09:05.362
The childhood star
from "My Secret Diary"

09:05.363 --> 09:08.265
who's been doing vodka shots
since she was nine? The same.

09:08.266 --> 09:09.566
Rainer is actually volunteering

09:09.567 --> 09:11.601
at her charity beach clean-up
that's going on right now.

09:11.602 --> 09:14.438
Which means you'll likely be
starting on "Locked" next week.

09:14.439 --> 09:17.507
Which means we gotta get you
a make-up artist, a stylist

09:17.508 --> 09:19.142
and maybe even a PR firm

09:19.143 --> 09:20.243
because this time I wanna

09:20.244 --> 09:21.411
stay ahead of the online haters

09:21.412 --> 09:22.446
and make a game plan.

09:22.447 --> 09:23.679
Got it?

09:45.760 --> 09:49.330
Right. One bag of trash
gets you one selfie.

09:49.331 --> 09:51.699
And don't forget to wear
plastic gloves, people.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.667
Hey, anyone that wants to hit
the beach down that way

09:53.668 --> 09:56.370
they'll find a large pod of dolphins.

09:56.371 --> 09:57.705
I counted 13.

09:57.706 --> 09:59.473
That's what we're here for, people.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.475
Clean oceans are trending.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.643
- And so are you!
- 'Yeah.'

10:02.644 --> 10:03.744
Yeah.

10:07.716 --> 10:09.783
I can't believe
I told you not to come.

10:09.784 --> 10:11.652
This is the best turnout
we've ever had.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.621
That's great. I love bein' here.

10:24.366 --> 10:26.734
Well, if it isn't mom and dad.

10:26.735 --> 10:28.602
Hey, Rainer.

10:28.603 --> 10:29.802
What are you doing?

10:30.438 --> 10:32.339
Um..

10:32.340 --> 10:33.741
Think it's obvious
what I'm doing, I'm..

10:33.742 --> 10:35.776
...trying to rid this
lovely, pristine planet

10:35.777 --> 10:37.811
of unwanted trash.

10:37.812 --> 10:41.415
If only it were that easy
in my personal life.

10:41.416 --> 10:43.517
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got work to do.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.386
Uh, wait, Rainer!

10:45.387 --> 10:47.454
We really need to talk.

10:47.455 --> 10:49.557
No, no, no. We don't.

10:49.558 --> 10:50.791
Okay, come on, Rainer. Let's talk.

10:50.792 --> 10:52.359
I mean, now that you left rehab

10:52.360 --> 10:53.460
we need to talk about, uh

10:53.461 --> 10:55.628
you know, are you ready
to come back to work?

10:56.498 --> 10:58.832
- Why?
- Why?

10:58.833 --> 11:02.570
Because the movie's been on hold
for two months is why.

11:02.571 --> 11:03.671
And the insurance money has run out

11:03.672 --> 11:05.573
and the studio
is about to pull the plug.

11:05.574 --> 11:06.674
That's not my problem, Nina.

11:06.675 --> 11:08.442
But if we were to tell
them that you were ready

11:08.443 --> 11:11.512
to go back to work, say, Monday,
we could save it.

11:11.513 --> 11:13.380
Do you hear yourself?

11:13.381 --> 11:14.515
I just got out of rehab.

11:14.516 --> 11:15.749
Not even 12 hours ago

11:15.750 --> 11:17.585
and all you care about is work

11:17.586 --> 11:19.353
and money and the movie.

11:19.354 --> 11:22.489
That is not fair,
and that is not true.

11:22.490 --> 11:23.557
Even your counselor said that you were

11:23.558 --> 11:24.692
healthy enough to go back to work.

11:24.693 --> 11:26.794
Healthy enough to check out.

11:26.795 --> 11:28.696
No one but you
is pressuring me to go back.

11:28.697 --> 11:32.566
Okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Rainer, hey, come on.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.435
You know we love you
and care about you.

11:36.605 --> 11:38.539
But this isn't about us,
a lot of people

11:38.540 --> 11:40.808
are depending on you to come
back and finish "Locked."

11:40.809 --> 11:42.610
A crew of about 300 people.

11:42.611 --> 11:44.378
For one.

11:44.379 --> 11:45.779
Come on.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.548
We're done here.

11:47.549 --> 11:49.783
But if you'd like to pick up
some trash..

11:49.784 --> 11:51.551
...that'd be great.

11:52.654 --> 11:54.421
I..

11:54.422 --> 11:55.422
- We even made his bed.
- Okay, okay, let's not..

11:55.423 --> 11:56.457
Pick up trash.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.359
Are you kidding me?

12:09.337 --> 12:11.371
Yeah. Oh.

12:13.308 --> 12:15.342
Whoa! You whopped my butt.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.511
Whoa, I, uh, probably
shouldn't have said butt.

12:17.512 --> 12:19.380
No, you got it right the first time.

12:19.381 --> 12:22.449
I did whoop your butt,
and I'll do it again.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.451
Alright, y'all.
You come take some photos.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.552
- 'That was so funny.'
- 'I know.'

12:30.792 --> 12:33.560
Hey, what's your director's name
over there?

12:33.561 --> 12:35.728
- Maricel.
- Maricel.

12:36.731 --> 12:37.831
Hey, Maricel.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.668
Wanna join? Take a photo?

12:40.669 --> 12:42.436
No. This is their moment.

12:42.437 --> 12:43.736
But thanks for coming.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.584
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah.

12:57.585 --> 12:59.753
You okay without having Shane
here? He decided he has to go.

12:59.754 --> 13:01.421
Sure, no problem.

13:02.624 --> 13:04.725
- You okay?
- Rainer's out.

13:04.726 --> 13:06.694
- What?
- Yeah, Rainer's out of rehab.

13:06.695 --> 13:08.362
That's actually why Joanie came by

13:08.363 --> 13:10.397
was to tell me and warn me
because people are still

13:10.398 --> 13:12.633
hating me and blaming me
on social media

13:12.634 --> 13:16.537
for putting him in rehab.
And now he's out.

13:16.538 --> 13:17.538
Does this mean you're gonna
have to go back

13:17.539 --> 13:18.919
to shooting "Locked" right away?

13:20.342 --> 13:21.342
I don't know.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.476
We still got at least three

13:22.477 --> 13:23.744
more weeks of shooting
before we finish.

13:23.745 --> 13:25.379
You know, maybe he doesn't wanna

13:25.380 --> 13:26.447
go back to work right away.

13:26.448 --> 13:27.748
Did he tell you that?

13:27.749 --> 13:29.583
No, y-you know I haven't talked to him

13:29.584 --> 13:31.518
since the press conference.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.653
Okay, what's Joanie think?

13:34.756 --> 13:37.324
Uh, she wants me to get ready.

13:37.325 --> 13:39.360
She's having people
come over later tonight

13:39.361 --> 13:41.695
for interviews, uh, styling

13:41.696 --> 13:43.497
and a PR firm and..

13:43.498 --> 13:45.332
So she thinks
you're going back right away.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.801
Yeah, but she doesn't know.
N-no one does.

13:47.802 --> 13:49.603
It's just a guess.

13:49.604 --> 13:51.538
Oh, wow! Okay.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.706
Uh, let's go!

13:52.707 --> 13:54.608
And, Georgia, remember,
you've never been happier

13:54.609 --> 13:55.875
in your entire life.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.584
This was fun. I'd like to come back.

14:03.585 --> 14:06.419
- Work with kids some more.
- Yeah, right.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.556
No, I r.. I really mean it.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.326
Mm, you all mean it when you say it.

14:12.327 --> 14:14.495
Wait. Who is "You all?"

14:14.496 --> 14:16.430
Celebrities with a cause.

14:16.431 --> 14:19.333
You come, play a few games
with the kids.

14:19.334 --> 14:20.367
Take a lot of photos

14:20.368 --> 14:22.469
and then we never see you again.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.371
No. No, that's not me.

14:24.372 --> 14:25.572
'Yo, Jordan, we gotta make a move'

14:25.573 --> 14:27.373
'or we're gonna be late for Ellen.'

14:28.643 --> 14:30.644
Thanks for coming.

14:30.645 --> 14:33.447
You'll see. I'm different.
Alright, I'll be back.

14:33.448 --> 14:35.449
In fact, the kids want me
to come back for game night.

14:35.450 --> 14:37.718
- When is that?
- Tomorrow, six o'clock.

14:37.719 --> 14:40.454
Alright then, I'll see you
tomorrow at six.

14:40.455 --> 14:41.622
Bye, Jordan.

14:41.623 --> 14:43.557
You'll see. I'm different.

14:51.332 --> 14:52.533
- Positive.
- There you go.

14:52.534 --> 14:54.802
- Oh, thank you, roomie.
- Okay, great.

14:54.803 --> 14:57.404
- Alright, Alexis, you ready?
- Mm-hm.

14:57.405 --> 14:58.638
Okay, great.

15:00.341 --> 15:01.442
So..

15:01.443 --> 15:03.577
...now, Alexis, did you
get to visit Rainer

15:03.578 --> 15:05.512
while he was in rehab?

15:05.513 --> 15:08.348
No, I didn't.

15:08.349 --> 15:10.551
But now that you asked that,
I kinda feel like an asshole.

15:10.552 --> 15:13.587
I probably should've. We were in
rehab together the first time.

15:13.588 --> 15:15.422
His first time.

15:15.423 --> 15:17.591
I had a real coke problem
back in the day.

15:17.592 --> 15:19.359
Oh, so now that he's out though

15:19.360 --> 15:21.462
you'll, you'll get
to see him again, you know

15:21.463 --> 15:23.564
work together
with all your old friends.

15:23.565 --> 15:26.433
Actors you worked with
on "Backsplash."

15:26.434 --> 15:29.636
People like Jordan Wilder,
and Tangey Turner...

15:29.637 --> 15:32.306
Oh, I love Jordan and Tangey.
They're great.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.741
Ah, so we wanna show you something

15:34.742 --> 15:38.377
'and then ask you what
you were feeling at the time?'

15:42.650 --> 15:44.518
Alexis?

15:44.519 --> 15:47.421
- This stays between us, okay?
- Okay.

15:47.422 --> 15:50.324
I didn't know you had cameras
in my bedroom.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.658
Is this about Jordan?

15:51.659 --> 15:54.761
I found out that he and Nina
had an affair.

15:54.762 --> 15:57.531
'Girl, that's a kaboom-ass bombshell.'

15:57.532 --> 16:00.367
I said no cameras that night.

16:00.368 --> 16:02.336
I can't believe you.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.371
Stop! Stop filming. Cut!

16:04.372 --> 16:06.373
Keep going. What are you
talking about, Alexis?

16:06.374 --> 16:07.441
You know the deal.

16:07.442 --> 16:09.409
You agreed to be on camera 24/7

16:09.410 --> 16:11.411
whether you knew it or not,
whether you liked it or not.

16:11.412 --> 16:13.313
You know what? I said stop filming!

16:13.314 --> 16:14.381
- Keep going.
- Ida.

16:14.382 --> 16:15.549
We need to talk in private.

16:15.550 --> 16:17.751
There is no such thing
as privacy anymore.

16:17.752 --> 16:20.754
Okay, my best friend, your daughter

16:20.755 --> 16:22.556
told me that in confidence.

16:22.557 --> 16:24.358
We can't betray her like that.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.293
You want a season two pickup?

16:26.294 --> 16:27.461
Then you gotta make a choice.

16:27.462 --> 16:30.529
Friends or fame.
Now what's it gonna be?

16:52.468 --> 16:55.637
I'm exhausted and starving.

16:55.638 --> 16:57.471
Let's see what we got.

17:00.743 --> 17:03.444
I can offer you..

17:03.445 --> 17:05.346
...saltines and olives?

17:05.347 --> 17:06.613
Maybe we should go out.

17:10.586 --> 17:12.486
I'd love to stay in.

17:20.762 --> 17:23.079
So, I might've overheard your parents

17:23.080 --> 17:26.050
asking you to go back to "Locked."

17:26.050 --> 17:27.251
Wanna talk about it?

17:27.252 --> 17:28.679
I really don't think
that's the best plan

17:28.680 --> 17:30.481
for my recovery.

17:30.482 --> 17:31.615
Well, let's be real, Rainer.

17:31.616 --> 17:33.450
I mean, you were in rehab
a month longer

17:33.451 --> 17:35.419
than you needed to be.

17:35.420 --> 17:36.420
Okay.

17:36.421 --> 17:37.421
I think you should go back

17:37.422 --> 17:38.655
to work, Rainer.

17:38.656 --> 17:39.690
I mean, post rehab you need something

17:39.691 --> 17:41.625
that gives your life purpose.

17:41.626 --> 17:42.760
Something that gives you meaning.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.561
What the hell are you talkin' about?

17:44.562 --> 17:45.729
I'm an actor.

17:45.730 --> 17:46.897
It's probably the most purpose-free

17:46.898 --> 17:49.700
meaningless career one can have.

17:49.701 --> 17:50.901
What you do has purpose.

17:50.902 --> 17:54.838
Over 300 people showed up
today just to see you.

17:54.839 --> 17:57.875
Just to take a selfie
with Rainer Devon.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.910
And then they stayed all day
long picking up trash

17:59.911 --> 18:01.712
because you asked them to.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.580
I think you're looking
at this all wrong

18:03.581 --> 18:06.515
because you can choose
how to use your celebrity.

18:07.552 --> 18:09.452
It's up to you, Rainer.

18:11.823 --> 18:13.556
Come here.

18:27.572 --> 18:31.408
Are you sure you can't extend
our policy one more week?

18:31.409 --> 18:33.809
No? Then why am I talking to you?

18:35.713 --> 18:37.714
They won't renew our insurance?

18:37.715 --> 18:38.848
Nope.

18:40.852 --> 18:43.587
Listen, you don't have to tell me.

18:43.588 --> 18:44.755
I'm gonna pack up my office

18:44.756 --> 18:46.889
so I can avoid
the walk of shame tomorrow.

18:49.727 --> 18:50.828
It's over.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.930
If you need anything, you let me know.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.603
Alan..

19:01.806 --> 19:02.806
He looked good, right?

19:02.807 --> 19:05.843
I mean... Rainer seems healthy.

19:05.844 --> 19:08.712
Yeah, I think he's still
battling with his demons

19:08.713 --> 19:09.746
but he's doing better.

19:09.747 --> 19:11.515
Because I was not gonna force him

19:11.516 --> 19:13.750
to go back on to the movie
if he wasn't ready.

19:13.751 --> 19:16.620
- I would never do that.
- No. I know that, Nina.

19:16.621 --> 19:18.455
But sadly, it's not up to you anymore

19:18.456 --> 19:20.790
so stop beating yourself up.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.541
See?

19:37.542 --> 19:39.775
It's sexy without being slutty.

19:41.679 --> 19:43.747
- I love it.
- Yeah?

19:43.748 --> 19:46.516
You don't think maybe
the skirt's a little too short?

19:46.517 --> 19:48.751
- No, no, no.
- No, no. It's gorgeous.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.590
Oh, hey! Uh, we're almost done.

19:53.591 --> 19:55.726
Jake, what do you think
of Paige's new look?

19:55.727 --> 19:57.628
- Ta-da!
- Great. She looks great.

19:57.629 --> 19:59.730
Uh, can I talk to you? Alone.

19:59.731 --> 20:02.633
Um, thank you so much, Sergei.

20:02.634 --> 20:03.901
We will let you know by tomorrow.

20:03.902 --> 20:06.603
I also picked something out
for your boyfriend.

20:06.604 --> 20:08.605
He's very Liam Hemsworth.

20:08.606 --> 20:11.475
Uh, you can take them. I'm good.

20:11.476 --> 20:13.443
Um, thanks, Sergei.

20:13.444 --> 20:14.878
That's very generous.

20:14.879 --> 20:15.879
Oui.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.680
Thank you.

20:18.683 --> 20:19.882
Thanks.

20:22.754 --> 20:26.456
Sergei dresses Ryan Gosling

20:26.457 --> 20:27.724
Liam Hemsworth, Zac Efron...

20:27.725 --> 20:29.559
I don't need anyone to dress me.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.794
Your Keds and hoodies
suggest otherwise.

20:30.795 --> 20:33.463
No, seriously, I think I'm fine
just the way I am.

20:33.464 --> 20:35.565
Well, if you wanna run
with the big boys in Hollywood

20:35.566 --> 20:37.901
your shirt needs to be
James Perse, not Jockey.

20:37.902 --> 20:39.937
I'm not having this conversation
right now.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.473
I really need to talk to you.

20:43.474 --> 20:45.808
Yeah, I'll go see
if the next stylist is ready.

20:49.914 --> 20:51.648
What's wrong?

20:51.649 --> 20:53.817
What's not wrong?

20:53.818 --> 20:55.652
Paige, I feel like you're acting
like nothing is wrong

20:55.653 --> 20:56.954
when everything is falling apart.

20:56.955 --> 20:59.790
Look, I got a hold of
the Sundance submissions office

20:59.791 --> 21:01.825
and they won't extend
the deadline. Not even a day.

21:01.826 --> 21:03.760
Alright. We'll step up production.

21:03.761 --> 21:05.562
Rest of the shoot days
are exterior days.

21:05.563 --> 21:06.730
There's just not enough time.

21:06.731 --> 21:08.632
Then rewrite the scenes.
Change 'em tonight.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.767
You seriously think that you can
work all night on "Georgia"

21:10.768 --> 21:12.636
after working all day on "Locked?"

21:12.637 --> 21:14.438
For how long, Paige?

21:14.439 --> 21:15.738
That's just not realistic.

21:17.675 --> 21:20.777
I'm gonna go for Sundance.

21:20.778 --> 21:22.913
I need to recast your part.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.614
Now.

21:24.615 --> 21:27.584
Well, what if you apply
to Sundance next year?

21:27.585 --> 21:28.885
And then we finish the film together

21:28.886 --> 21:30.787
after I'm done with "Locked."

21:30.788 --> 21:32.556
Do you want me to just wait,
an entire year?

21:32.557 --> 21:34.624
No, of course..

21:34.625 --> 21:36.927
No, I don't want you to wait
an entire year.

21:36.928 --> 21:38.628
I know how important this is to you.

21:38.629 --> 21:41.665
It is. Hey, I cannot wait.

21:41.666 --> 21:43.734
Because next year, you'll
probably just book another movie

21:43.735 --> 21:46.470
or the sequel to "Locked,"
and you should.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.471
I mean, that's what you want, right?

21:47.472 --> 21:48.605
Why are you getting mad at me?

21:48.606 --> 21:50.640
I don't wanna give up on all the work

21:50.641 --> 21:52.642
we've put into this film
just as much as you do.

21:52.643 --> 21:54.778
I love the role of Georgia, okay?

21:54.779 --> 21:56.946
I just wish there was a way
I could do both.

21:59.550 --> 22:00.884
But..

22:00.885 --> 22:03.520
...I understand if you can't wait.

22:03.521 --> 22:06.456
No, I-I want to get.. Come in.

22:06.457 --> 22:07.837
This is the last one, I promise.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.461
Paige, this is Suki Namaguchi.

22:11.462 --> 22:14.531
Okay, look, Paige. It's gonna be fine.

22:14.532 --> 22:15.699
We're gonna figure it out.

22:15.700 --> 22:16.900
Cassy and I are gonna be
down at the bar.

22:16.901 --> 22:18.801
Just meet us if you want.

22:29.781 --> 22:31.815
I don't even know
where to hold auditions.

22:31.816 --> 22:33.717
At our apartment. Adam won't mind.

22:33.718 --> 22:35.652
I couldn't ask you to do that.

22:35.653 --> 22:36.920
You don't have to.

22:36.921 --> 22:39.489
I'm like a filmmaking fairy godmother.

22:39.490 --> 22:40.557
What else do you got?

22:40.558 --> 22:41.792
A new lead actress and a time machine

22:41.793 --> 22:44.561
so I can film everything
before the Sundance deadline.

22:44.562 --> 22:46.563
But even then, I don't think
I'm gonna make the deadline.

22:46.564 --> 22:48.598
You shut up. Okay?

22:48.599 --> 22:50.634
You gotta be positive.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.469
We'll make it happen.

22:52.470 --> 22:53.703
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

22:53.704 --> 22:55.704
- Hey, Cassy.
- Hi.

22:56.808 --> 22:57.908
Is that, uh, what you're gonna wear

22:57.909 --> 22:59.669
when you see
Rainer for the first time again?

23:01.813 --> 23:05.582
Okay, how's the think tank going?

23:05.583 --> 23:07.451
It's good, I mean, Cassy's been great

23:07.452 --> 23:09.885
at helping me figure out
this fuckin' problem I'm in.

23:10.888 --> 23:14.524
Wait, I think I just solved it.

23:14.525 --> 23:16.827
W-w-why, why don't I recast
your part with Cassy?

23:16.828 --> 23:18.628
You know all the lines.
You'd be great.

23:18.629 --> 23:20.664
Uh, seriously? Uh, yes.

23:20.665 --> 23:21.964
I love that idea.

23:23.868 --> 23:27.537
I mean, Paige, if,
if it's cool with you.

23:27.538 --> 23:28.738
No, I mean, of course it's cool.

23:28.739 --> 23:32.442
It's just, that would mean
that Jake has to

23:32.443 --> 23:35.512
recast your part, so he has to reshoot

23:35.513 --> 23:38.514
not only my scenes but your scenes..

23:39.617 --> 23:40.749
It's the entire film.

23:41.853 --> 23:43.653
- Oh!
- Oh!

23:43.654 --> 23:44.788
Mm.

23:44.789 --> 23:46.923
See, hi.. Can I get
another round, please?

23:46.924 --> 23:48.692
Thanks.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.627
Uh..

23:50.628 --> 23:52.562
Oh, what about, um..

23:52.563 --> 23:53.797
...the waitress at the diner?

23:53.798 --> 23:55.832
You said she read your script
and that she was really good.

23:55.833 --> 23:57.601
- Vera, right?
- Yeah.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.736
Although, I might be more impressed

23:59.737 --> 24:01.438
because she was roller-skatin'

24:01.439 --> 24:03.406
and pouring coffee at the same time.

24:03.407 --> 24:04.541
But, yeah, let's audition her.

24:04.542 --> 24:05.609
Uh, i-if not her, there's gotta be

24:05.610 --> 24:06.743
other actresses out there.

24:06.744 --> 24:08.678
That is the spirit.

24:08.679 --> 24:10.413
Okay, and I will help you post

24:10.414 --> 24:11.715
on all the right casting websites.

24:11.716 --> 24:15.452
Okay. Yeah. I'll hold an audition.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.486
And get a hold of Vera and..

24:18.789 --> 24:21.625
Gosh, we're..
We're still makin' a movie.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.827
- To "Stealing Georgia."
- To "Stealing Georgia."

24:23.828 --> 24:25.862
Yes!

24:28.766 --> 24:31.468
- Ugh!
- That was disgusting.

24:43.514 --> 24:44.614
Hm.

24:46.484 --> 24:47.616
Hey!

24:48.586 --> 24:50.586
- Honey..
- Don't get up.

24:52.523 --> 24:53.822
I'll finish "Locked."

24:54.825 --> 24:57.727
Okay. Well, thank you.

24:57.728 --> 25:00.497
I'm not doing it for you.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.532
I'm doing it for the 300 crew
members who depend on this job.

25:04.735 --> 25:06.468
But after this..

25:07.705 --> 25:09.439
...I'm done working with you.

25:42.109 --> 25:45.378
Thank you, Rainer, for making
the decision to come back.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.479
What is it, Nina?

25:46.480 --> 25:48.514
We are going to resume
production on Monday.

25:48.515 --> 25:51.117
Julie what's-her-name
won't be there, right?

25:51.118 --> 25:53.452
No, but we're hoping that you
and the entire cast

25:53.453 --> 25:56.122
can be there tonight for
a Facebook Live announcement.

25:56.123 --> 25:58.291
I'll have to reschedule some
TV interviews but that's cool.

25:58.292 --> 26:00.192
Look for a call sheet in your inbox.

26:00.193 --> 26:02.194
Yes, I will be there.

26:02.195 --> 26:04.163
Bye. Great!

26:04.164 --> 26:07.166
Now I have to put the frickin'
fat suit back on. Stop!

26:07.167 --> 26:09.100
Great news, Nina.

26:10.337 --> 26:13.571
No, I'm not doing
Jake's film any longer.

26:15.442 --> 26:18.077
Okay, cool.

26:18.078 --> 26:19.512
Yay! See you then.

26:22.449 --> 26:24.182
So, it's official?

26:26.486 --> 26:29.488
Yes. Also it's back to work on Monday.

26:29.489 --> 26:31.257
And how do you feel?

26:31.258 --> 26:33.159
Besides hung-over.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.493
Nervous.

26:34.494 --> 26:36.195
I just don't know
how I'm supposed to do

26:36.196 --> 26:38.197
all these romantic love scenes
with someone

26:38.198 --> 26:40.399
who won't even talk to me.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.169
I tried to text Rainer when he
got out of rehab to talk

26:43.170 --> 26:45.504
and he didn't even text me back.

26:45.505 --> 26:49.141
Well, maybe when he has
to see you he'll come around.

26:49.142 --> 26:50.443
Yeah, maybe.

26:50.444 --> 26:53.278
And I've to see him in
the Facebook Live event today.

26:55.549 --> 26:58.384
I'm really glad you slept over, Cass.

26:58.385 --> 26:59.517
Me too.

27:02.222 --> 27:04.155
Is Jake still breathing?

27:09.029 --> 27:11.030
When did that happen?

27:11.031 --> 27:14.333
I don't know
but isn't it so cute though?

27:14.334 --> 27:17.236
Um, uh.. I don't kn..
I'm going back to bed.

27:18.372 --> 27:19.571
Poke!

27:32.119 --> 27:34.186
- Hi.
- Hey!

27:34.187 --> 27:35.421
- Hi.
- Mwah.

27:35.422 --> 27:37.323
- Hi.
- Wait.

27:37.324 --> 27:40.493
Just, just you and me again?
No cameras?

27:40.494 --> 27:43.161
No, no, no.
It's just, just the two of us.

27:43.530 --> 27:45.097
Wow!

27:45.098 --> 27:46.432
I feel so special.

27:46.433 --> 27:48.501
- Two nights in a row.
- Do you?

27:48.502 --> 27:51.303
Because you know you're
really special to me, right?

27:51.304 --> 27:53.172
And, like, that's what I am
to you, too, right?

27:53.173 --> 27:54.440
Like, that's the kinda
relationship we have

27:54.441 --> 27:56.542
like best-friends-forever
type of friends, right?

27:56.543 --> 27:59.178
Are you okay, Lexi?

27:59.179 --> 28:00.379
You-you're not on anything, are you?

28:00.380 --> 28:03.349
No! God, no. It's just..

28:03.350 --> 28:05.451
This show, these cameras.

28:05.452 --> 28:08.320
Like, I'm never alone,
they follow me everywhere.

28:08.321 --> 28:11.357
I had to lie and say that
I had a gyno appointment

28:11.358 --> 28:12.458
to get rid of them.

28:12.459 --> 28:14.093
- Stop.
- Yeah.

28:14.094 --> 28:15.227
It's, like, taken away any amount

28:15.228 --> 28:17.396
of normal life that I have
which, you know

28:17.397 --> 28:20.099
makes me really cherish a real friend

28:20.100 --> 28:21.434
which is you.

28:21.435 --> 28:23.269
Wait, we really are best friends...

28:23.270 --> 28:25.271
Will you stop it?

28:25.272 --> 28:27.506
Of course, we're best friends, okay?

28:27.507 --> 28:29.208
And I love you.

28:29.209 --> 28:31.444
I love you. I do. I love you.

28:31.445 --> 28:34.180
Okay? Breathe.

28:34.181 --> 28:35.514
Alright.

28:35.515 --> 28:39.085
Now, can we drink or not?

28:39.086 --> 28:41.220
You know what? Let's go out.

28:41.221 --> 28:43.289
It's still early. We could
probably get into Katsuya.

28:43.290 --> 28:45.191
Whatever. Let's go.

28:52.099 --> 28:55.101
Okay, I know my apartment
is the set of a reality show

28:55.102 --> 28:58.170
but I would like a heads up
if you're gonna hang out here.

28:58.171 --> 29:00.306
I'm not hangin' out.
I'm waitin' on you.

29:00.307 --> 29:02.073
On your answer.

29:04.111 --> 29:05.211
No.

29:05.445 --> 29:07.145
Never.

29:10.050 --> 29:11.350
- Really?
- Look, Ida.

29:11.351 --> 29:14.120
Tangey's the only friend I have.

29:14.121 --> 29:15.321
We're not airing it.

29:15.322 --> 29:17.022
I'm an equal producer to you

29:17.023 --> 29:18.090
and I say we don't need it.

29:18.091 --> 29:20.059
Is that right?

29:20.060 --> 29:21.393
Well, you better bring me
something better.

29:21.394 --> 29:24.396
I will. I promise.

29:24.397 --> 29:26.332
I'll get you
see-behind-the-scenes footage

29:26.333 --> 29:28.100
of "Locked."

29:28.101 --> 29:29.502
After all, Rainer's fresh out of rehab

29:29.503 --> 29:31.437
and Paige chose Jake over him

29:31.438 --> 29:33.372
and all they have left
are their love scenes.

29:33.373 --> 29:36.408
So, trust me, there'll be plenty
of shocking, juicy stuff

29:36.409 --> 29:38.377
and I'll be there for all of that.

29:38.378 --> 29:40.513
And if there's not..

29:40.514 --> 29:43.281
...I'll just turn up the heat
and stir the pot myself.

29:58.116 --> 29:59.781
Oh, we just closed the kitchen
for lunch.

29:59.782 --> 30:00.815
But you're more than welcome to sit

30:00.816 --> 30:02.384
and order a beverage if you like.

30:02.385 --> 30:03.451
Uh, actually, I'm looking

30:03.452 --> 30:04.586
for one of your waitresses.

30:04.587 --> 30:06.488
Vera, blonde hair, roller skates.

30:06.489 --> 30:09.357
Uh, sorry, she was fired.

30:09.358 --> 30:10.425
- Fired?
- 'Yeah.'

30:10.426 --> 30:12.727
She was givin' out cold fries
and hot monologue.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.762
She had to go.

30:13.763 --> 30:15.530
Well, can you give me her number

30:15.531 --> 30:16.731
or where she works now or somethin'?

30:16.732 --> 30:18.533
Look, she wasn't the best waitress

30:18.534 --> 30:20.502
but I'm not handin' out
her number to any guy

30:20.503 --> 30:21.503
who walks through the door.

30:21.504 --> 30:22.604
No, it's not like that.

30:22.605 --> 30:23.738
Uh, I'm a director.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.507
That's what they all say.

30:25.508 --> 30:27.409
Sorry.

30:28.778 --> 30:29.878
Awesome.

30:33.683 --> 30:34.849
'Hey, Maricel.'

30:34.850 --> 30:37.819
Yeah, as soon as this work gets done.

30:37.820 --> 30:40.555
'I'll change into
my game night clothes.'

30:40.556 --> 30:41.723
That's right.

30:41.724 --> 30:43.557
See you soon.

30:43.859 --> 30:45.559
Thanks.

30:45.861 --> 30:47.495
Hey, Paige.

30:47.496 --> 30:50.465
Hey! Jordan, how are you?

30:50.466 --> 30:53.601
Um, congrats on all
your Oscar, buzz. That's huge.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.769
Don't congratulate me just yet.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.605
I got a long way before
those Oscar noms come out.

30:57.606 --> 30:58.840
Well, I loved your film.

30:58.841 --> 31:00.408
I thought you were really great in it.

31:00.409 --> 31:01.810
- Thanks, Paige.
- Um..

31:01.811 --> 31:04.646
Hey, so, uh, how is Rainer doing?

31:04.647 --> 31:06.648
Getting out of rehab. Is he okay?

31:06.649 --> 31:09.550
He's alright.
Takin' it one day at a time.

31:11.387 --> 31:13.488
He's gonna be fine.

31:13.489 --> 31:15.390
I'm headed over. You comin'?

31:15.391 --> 31:16.458
Yeah, well

31:16.459 --> 31:17.826
Jordan, um..

31:17.827 --> 31:20.462
You and Rainer are friends,
best friends

31:20.463 --> 31:22.597
and you're an actor I really admire

31:22.598 --> 31:24.466
so I could really use your advice

31:24.467 --> 31:25.834
because Rainer won't even talk to me.

31:25.835 --> 31:27.769
And then next week
we go back to playing

31:27.770 --> 31:29.704
these two people who are in love.

31:29.705 --> 31:31.539
Look, I know he'll come around.

31:31.540 --> 31:33.408
Really? 'Cause he hasn't so far.

31:33.409 --> 31:35.610
He wouldn't even see me
in rehab, as I'm sure you know.

31:35.611 --> 31:37.712
And I just feel like he, he blames me.

31:37.713 --> 31:40.582
Oh, his addiction has nothing
to do with you, Paige.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.748
Okay, but..

31:43.519 --> 31:45.653
...all we have left
is romantic love scenes.

31:45.654 --> 31:46.855
How are we supposed to do those?

31:46.856 --> 31:49.491
Look. You're still into Jake, right?

31:49.492 --> 31:50.792
Well, y-yeah.

31:50.793 --> 31:53.660
So, if Rainer's still hating,
use your feelings for Jake.

31:56.432 --> 31:57.764
Come on, let's head over.

32:00.770 --> 32:02.337
- Almost, almost.
- Alright.

32:02.338 --> 32:03.571
- Almost show time.
- So far, so good.

32:03.572 --> 32:07.342
Now that we are finally,
finally back on Monday

32:07.343 --> 32:08.676
'we are gonna be doing
an announcement..'

32:08.677 --> 32:10.412
Are you kidding me?

32:10.413 --> 32:13.415
We're gonna be announcing it
for Facebook Live.

32:13.416 --> 32:16.451
No! No cameras!

32:16.452 --> 32:18.586
...where we will announce it
to the world..

32:18.587 --> 32:20.522
- Hey, Nina.
- You can't bring those in here.

32:20.523 --> 32:22.624
I'm allowed to film my reality show.

32:22.625 --> 32:25.460
Well, I'm sure you are,
but not on the "Locked" set.

32:25.461 --> 32:28.430
This is not the
"Locked" set, this is Facebook.

32:28.431 --> 32:29.764
- Um, no!
- Excuse me?

32:29.765 --> 32:31.599
It's a complete sentence.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.767
You're not allowed
to bring the cameras in.

32:32.768 --> 32:34.402
And I've already discussed
this with Ida.

32:34.403 --> 32:36.471
Nina, that's ridiculous,
there's cameras in there

32:36.472 --> 32:37.772
filming anyway. What's the big deal?

32:37.773 --> 32:39.607
Uh, the big deal
is that we get to control

32:39.608 --> 32:41.609
the information
and the content that goes out

32:41.610 --> 32:44.579
not some trashy reality show.

32:44.580 --> 32:47.682
Hey, get that camera
off of Rainer. Stop that.

32:47.683 --> 32:49.784
Nina, I can assure you,
my show will be airing

32:49.785 --> 32:52.387
well after this Facebook Live
announcement.

32:52.388 --> 32:54.456
There are no cameras allowed.

32:54.457 --> 32:57.492
Not here, and not
on the "Locked" set. Period.

32:57.493 --> 32:58.660
I can't have you spoiling
plot points...

32:58.661 --> 33:00.361
Well, that's not
what my show is about.

33:00.362 --> 33:02.430
That's right, it's about
getting nipple rings

33:02.431 --> 33:03.798
and trashing everyone in Hollywood.

33:03.799 --> 33:06.367
I do not have..
I don't have nipple rings.

33:06.368 --> 33:07.702
But that's not who we hired.

33:07.703 --> 33:08.803
We hired someone who we thought

33:08.804 --> 33:10.438
to be a top-notch actress

33:10.439 --> 33:12.574
not some sell-out who's pandering

33:12.575 --> 33:14.809
to the lowest common denominator.

33:14.810 --> 33:16.811
How dare you?

33:16.812 --> 33:18.646
If your camera crew
doesn't turn around

33:18.647 --> 33:21.349
and exit this lot with security now

33:21.350 --> 33:23.617
you will also be escorted off the lot.

33:24.453 --> 33:25.786
So, which will it be?

33:28.390 --> 33:30.658
If my cameras can't come in

33:30.659 --> 33:32.760
I'm not either.

33:32.761 --> 33:34.496
Fine.

33:34.497 --> 33:36.631
Your choice.

33:36.632 --> 33:39.434
- Close the doors.
- Wait, what?

33:39.435 --> 33:41.536
Uh, excuse me.

33:41.537 --> 33:42.837
Hey!

33:42.838 --> 33:44.671
Screw you, Nina!

33:46.709 --> 33:48.543
Keep telling yourself that.

33:48.544 --> 33:51.679
Heh-heh! I am so excited
to get back to work.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.581
I really miss our cast and crew.

33:53.582 --> 33:56.851
It's really, really exciting.

33:56.852 --> 33:59.387
And I just want to say
thank you to all my fans

33:59.388 --> 34:01.389
who supported me when I was in rehab.

34:01.390 --> 34:03.558
All your letters and cards

34:03.559 --> 34:05.426
your encouragement

34:05.427 --> 34:06.594
really got me through.

34:06.595 --> 34:08.496
Yeah. So we're back
and we're a family.

34:08.496 --> 34:10.291
Be on the lookout
for those trailers comin'.

34:10.292 --> 34:12.333
'In theaters and on TV.'

34:12.333 --> 34:14.435
Yes, uh, I heard the trailers

34:14.436 --> 34:16.771
will be hitting theaters next weekend.

34:16.772 --> 34:18.672
It's coming your way, fans.

34:18.674 --> 34:20.808
"Locked, 2019."

34:20.809 --> 34:22.810
- Whoo!
- Yay! So exciting!

34:25.414 --> 34:26.748
We're back. We're back.

34:26.748 --> 34:29.417
- Way to step it up.
- Rainer, can I talk to you fo..

34:29.418 --> 34:32.587
- W-wait.. Rainer..
- That was great, guys.

34:32.588 --> 34:34.489
- 'Thank you.'
- 'Copy that. We're out.'

34:34.489 --> 34:35.590
'Rainer!'

34:36.592 --> 34:38.725
- Rainer. Hey!
- Shh.

34:44.766 --> 34:46.434
Rainer!

34:46.435 --> 34:48.702
Rainer, stop! Please!

34:54.710 --> 34:55.810
I wanna talk to you

34:55.811 --> 34:58.712
but I think you already know that.

35:00.649 --> 35:02.417
Okay.

35:02.418 --> 35:03.518
Talk.

35:06.388 --> 35:10.592
Well, we're about to go back
to work playing two people

35:10.593 --> 35:14.329
who are madly in love, and..

35:14.330 --> 35:17.565
You know, maybe we should
talk about what happened.

35:17.566 --> 35:20.434
You know, get some closure, move on.

35:21.337 --> 35:22.604
Closure?

35:22.605 --> 35:26.574
Why would I need closure
for something that never was?

35:26.575 --> 35:29.744
Closure is for two people
who had something.

35:29.745 --> 35:32.347
But, if you're talking about
bailing on me

35:32.348 --> 35:34.414
at the press conference..

35:35.584 --> 35:37.785
...I should thank you.

35:37.786 --> 35:40.821
It was the single best thing
that's ever happened to me..

35:42.491 --> 35:45.493
...because I found someone
really special.

35:45.494 --> 35:47.428
You and me..

35:47.429 --> 35:49.597
...we would've burned out by now.

35:53.502 --> 35:56.371
But instead, I found this new person

35:56.372 --> 35:59.707
who I have a deep,
soulful connection with.

35:59.708 --> 36:01.708
Crazy for each other.

36:04.780 --> 36:07.581
That's great.
I'm really happy for you.

36:09.551 --> 36:11.486
Don't worry about playing two people

36:11.487 --> 36:13.553
who are madly in love.

36:18.427 --> 36:20.460
It's called acting.

36:49.337 --> 36:50.603
What are you lookin' for?

36:55.243 --> 36:56.343
Somethin' to eat.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.543
I'm starvin'.

36:59.414 --> 37:01.081
What are we..

37:01.082 --> 37:04.151
You.. What do you..
Uh, you headin' out?

37:04.152 --> 37:07.154
Yeah, I'm going
to the City Block Kids.

37:07.155 --> 37:09.156
- Oh, well, good, good, good.
- What are you up to?

37:09.157 --> 37:11.091
- You and Harper hangin' out?
- Uh, no.

37:11.092 --> 37:12.359
We're... she's doin' a meetin'

37:12.360 --> 37:14.361
with her board of her charity
or somethin'.

37:14.362 --> 37:16.163
Ah, right.

37:16.164 --> 37:18.598
So, did you find
what you were lookin' for?

37:21.202 --> 37:23.103
To eat.

37:23.104 --> 37:25.339
There's nothin' really here, man.

37:25.340 --> 37:26.606
I haven't had time to shop.

37:28.443 --> 37:31.444
Yeah, you're not really
the domestic type, or..

37:33.114 --> 37:35.282
Um..

37:35.283 --> 37:36.583
You know what, it's kinda late.

37:36.584 --> 37:38.452
I'll, uh, volunteer later.

37:38.453 --> 37:42.155
Yeah? I think I'm gonna stay in.

37:42.156 --> 37:44.358
Wanna order some Thai food?
Sound good?

37:44.359 --> 37:46.126
That's..

37:46.127 --> 37:47.394
That'd be great. Thanks.

37:47.395 --> 37:51.131
Cool. I'll order. The usual?

37:51.132 --> 37:54.334
Double up the satay.
I'm really hungry.

37:54.335 --> 37:56.435
Uh, I'm gonna go get out of this suit.

38:07.549 --> 38:09.315
Coming.

38:14.556 --> 38:16.323
Oh, hi. Wow.

38:16.324 --> 38:18.492
You look.. You look amazing.

38:18.493 --> 38:21.528
I don't think I've ever seen you
so dressed up before.

38:21.529 --> 38:24.331
It's, uh, what Sergei
picked out for me.

38:24.332 --> 38:26.133
Me and Liam Hemsworth.

38:26.134 --> 38:27.401
I feel bad for Liam.

38:27.402 --> 38:29.536
Look, Paige, I just want to apologize.

38:29.537 --> 38:31.572
Uh, since you told me
you have to go back to work

38:31.573 --> 38:34.174
all I kept thinking about was
all the things I was losing...

38:34.175 --> 38:38.211
No, no. I, I'm sorry, too.

38:38.212 --> 38:40.414
Uh, he was acting like
it was no big deal, and...

38:40.415 --> 38:42.549
No. I messed up.

38:42.550 --> 38:45.218
I-I was so worried about all
the things I was losing

38:45.219 --> 38:47.653
that I overlooked everything
that we could gain.

38:50.191 --> 38:51.358
I mean, maybe we made our relationship

38:51.359 --> 38:52.392
too much about working together

38:52.393 --> 38:54.460
instead of being together.

38:55.597 --> 38:58.332
Because I realized, in all the years

38:58.333 --> 39:01.101
we've been roommates and friends

39:01.102 --> 39:02.602
never once taken you out on a date.

39:04.339 --> 39:07.206
So, Paige Townsen..

39:08.376 --> 39:10.477
...will you go on a date with me?

39:13.314 --> 39:15.414
- Can you spin?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll spin.

39:20.088 --> 39:21.455
Yes. Yes. Yes.

39:39.340 --> 39:40.507
'Paige! Paige!'

39:44.512 --> 39:47.214
'Paige, over here. Over here.'

40:00.461 --> 40:02.262
If your camera
crew doesn't turn around

40:02.263 --> 40:04.531
and exit this lot with security now

40:04.532 --> 40:07.167
you will also be escorted off the lot.

40:07.168 --> 40:09.269
'Uh, excuse me?'

40:09.270 --> 40:10.703
'Well, screw you, Nina.'

40:35.596 --> 40:38.532
How did I feel when I first
found out Jordan and Nina

40:38.533 --> 40:40.566
had been having an affair?

40:41.536 --> 40:43.437
I was shocked.

40:43.438 --> 40:45.539
'I didn't even believe it at first.'

40:45.540 --> 40:48.275
I mean, for a mother to be having sex

40:48.276 --> 40:50.509
with her son's best friend?

40:51.679 --> 40:54.648
And then it got worse.

40:54.649 --> 40:56.650
Tangey told me they first
started sleeping together

40:56.651 --> 40:59.386
'when we were filming "Backsplash."'

40:59.387 --> 41:01.254
Yes, "Backsplash."

41:01.255 --> 41:04.191
When Jordan was 16.

41:04.192 --> 41:06.426
I mean, who does that?

41:06.427 --> 41:08.628
Who would take an advantage
of a young a-actor

41:08.629 --> 41:11.531
a-at such a sensitive time
in his life after his parents

41:11.532 --> 41:13.599
just died in a car crash?

41:15.169 --> 41:17.236
So you wanna know what I think?

41:18.439 --> 41:21.341
I think Nina Devon should go to jail

41:21.342 --> 41:22.576
for what she's done.
