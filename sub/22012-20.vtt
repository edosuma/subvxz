WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.960
ADULT ADAM: Ah, baseball.
America's pastime.

00:04.047 --> 00:06.180
Growing up, my brother Barry
was one of those kids

00:06.267 --> 00:08.660
whose dream
was to take the mound
at Veterans Stadium.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.488
And then, one day,
he got an actual shot

00:10.575 --> 00:12.447
to become
a Philadelphia Philly,

00:12.534 --> 00:16.277
thanks to one of the greatest gimmicks of the '80s, the radio call-in contest.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.496
ANNOUNCER:
Angelo Cataldi here with the
opportunity of a lifetime,

00:18.583 --> 00:22.848
the 100th caller
throws out the first pitch
at the Phillies game.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.721
Lucky, Adam,
thank you for joining me.

00:25.808 --> 00:29.725
Today, Big Tasty wins the most
coveted prize in AM radio.

00:29.812 --> 00:32.510
You do realize these are
virtually impossible
to win, right?

00:32.597 --> 00:35.122
Not when you invented
a top-secret formula

00:35.209 --> 00:37.124
that guarantees me to be
the 100th caller.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.429
Seriously

00:38.516 --> 00:41.258
Two words,
math matics.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.608
Just hit caller 85.
So close.

00:43.695 --> 00:46.046
It's 1.7 seconds
per call,

00:46.133 --> 00:49.005
so if I multiply
the amount of callers
by the rate of calls,

00:49.092 --> 00:51.051
then I dial them up
in exactly...

00:51.138 --> 00:53.270
Dial right now!
Don't wait another second!

00:53.357 --> 00:55.620
37 minutes.
Yeah, that's not right.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.100
Just hit caller 90.

00:57.187 --> 00:58.580
You should call
right now!

00:58.667 --> 01:00.843
You dare question
my Texas Instruments?

01:00.930 --> 01:03.454
It's from Texas.
That's where NASA is, bro!

01:03.541 --> 01:06.892
Caller 95!
Get off your ass and call!

01:06.979 --> 01:09.156
Now we just sit and wait,
Lucky.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.549
Congrats.
You're the 100th caller.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.247
What?
That's impossible!

01:13.334 --> 01:15.075
What's your name,
and where you from?

01:15.162 --> 01:16.989
ADAM: Adam Goldberg.
I'm from Jenkintown.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.340
Oh, no.

01:19.427 --> 01:22.169
This is amazing.
I've literally
never won anything.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.561
What the hell
are you doing?

01:23.648 --> 01:24.910
Yeah, I'll hold.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.782
Just stole
your stupid baseball pitch.

01:26.869 --> 01:28.436
You can't, dude!

01:28.523 --> 01:31.308
This pitch is an opportunity
of a lifetime!How?

01:31.395 --> 01:33.745
'Cause once the Phillies
see my flamethrower,

01:33.832 --> 01:36.531
they'll give me a brand-new
Mustang as a signing bonus.

01:36.618 --> 01:39.925
Aw, that's a shame,
'cause instead,
you get to watch me.

01:40.012 --> 01:43.146
Please, I'll give you
anything you want.Go on.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.540
My Sports Illustrated
football phone.No.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.933
A Rubik's Cube with
all the stickers taken off

01:48.020 --> 01:49.631
so you always win.
No.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.676
A leaf that looks
like a boob.Nope.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.591
This incredibly
stretched-out Coke bottle

01:53.678 --> 01:55.637
filled with colored sand.
Nah.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.204
A limited-edition butt mug.
Pass.

01:57.291 --> 02:00.032
Super Madball Touchdown Terror
football.Uh-uh.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.035
This awesome drawing
I made of a leopard.Do better.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.429
My prized
Kathy Ireland poster

02:05.516 --> 02:07.083
personally autographed
to me.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.824
You misspelled "Kathy."

02:08.911 --> 02:10.391
Final offer,

02:10.478 --> 02:13.524
whenever Mom tries
to snuggle you in any way,

02:13.611 --> 02:16.005
I will act as a human shield
to protect.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.311
Now that I'll take.

02:17.398 --> 02:19.617
Ha, sucker.
Oh, yeah?

02:19.704 --> 02:22.751
Hey, Mama. Those vanilla-chunk
cookies smell amazing.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.449
You know what else
is an amazing vanilla chunk?

02:25.536 --> 02:27.495
You.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.540
Not on my watch.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.238
Barry, no.
This neck nuzzle is for Adam.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.805
Well, you have no choice
but to nuzzle my neck instead.

02:33.892 --> 02:36.547
Well, that's an
unexpected win-win.

02:36.634 --> 02:39.811
Ah! Don't doubt yourself,
Barry. Do it for the Phillies.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.944
This is so worth it.

02:42.031 --> 02:44.338
This really is!

02:44.425 --> 02:45.774
♪ I'm twisted up inside

02:45.861 --> 02:49.169
♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:52.172 --> 02:53.782
♪ I don't know the future

02:53.869 --> 02:57.568
♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪

02:57.655 --> 02:59.440
ADULT ADAM: It was May 2nd,
1980-something,

02:59.527 --> 03:01.703
and Erica was showing
her best friend, Lainey,

03:01.790 --> 03:03.313
around the greatest place
on Earth.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.967
Seriously,
college is the best.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.099
My classes are, like,
so interesting.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.494
Mine, too. I'm always like,
"I did not know that."

03:10.581 --> 03:12.844
I love the parties
and meeting smart people

03:12.931 --> 03:15.151
and living with my roommate,
who is awesome.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.370
Tell me about it.

03:16.457 --> 03:18.633
I love my roommate,
The Raven.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.678
The what?
It's her Wiccan name.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.985
She's so cool and artsy
and chain smokes

03:23.072 --> 03:24.378
and flicks the ashes at me
while I sleep.

03:24.465 --> 03:25.814
Yeah,
she doesn't sound great.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.251
That's 'cause she's not!
She's horrible and scary!

03:28.338 --> 03:30.210
And I hate her
and everything
else at college.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.646
Well, thank God.
Me too!

03:31.733 --> 03:32.864
Really?
Yes!

03:32.951 --> 03:34.126
I only said that college
is the best

03:34.214 --> 03:36.041
because you seemed
really positive about it.

03:36.128 --> 03:39.131
Oh, no. Fashion school
was such a mistake.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.264
I like buying clothes
and the wearing them part,

03:41.351 --> 03:43.788
but making my own stuff
sucks 'cause I have to do
the sewing.

03:43.875 --> 03:44.876
You know what's worse?

03:44.963 --> 03:46.095
I came here
to play music,

03:46.182 --> 03:47.618
but all they make me do
is read these big,

03:47.705 --> 03:49.054
boring textbooks
about it.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.621
You could sue.
For sure!

03:50.708 --> 03:52.275
I'm not a lawyer,
but I have a real case here.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.364
God, I miss high school
so much.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.105
You and me,
singing in my room,

03:56.192 --> 03:57.585
dreaming of being stars.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.543
We were so young last year.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.023
Such a happy time.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.894
Honestly, I wish we could
just forget about college,

04:02.981 --> 04:04.331
start a band,
and have fun again.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.725
Then let's do it.
Do what?

04:07.812 --> 04:09.031
Lainey, we're adults now.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.902
We can do
whatever the hell we want.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.383
Yeah, I don't think
I can just blow off school
to start a band.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.124
I have a mid-term project
due next week.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.474
So? I have
a music theory final
tomorrow

04:17.561 --> 04:19.694
and I haven't even
cracked open
this giant book.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.609
Is this really happening?

04:21.696 --> 04:23.088
Are we blowing off school
to become a rock 'n' roll
super

04:23.175 --> 04:25.134
We'll be like Joan Jett
meets The Bangles.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.657
Meets Madonna.
Obviously!

04:26.744 --> 04:28.703
All we need now is
a kick-ass lady drummer.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.270
Ooh, that's gonna be
hard to find.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.836
I'll do it.
Wait, really?

04:31.923 --> 04:33.969
I thought you were
an Art History major.

04:34.056 --> 04:36.232
My stupid mom forced me
to take marching band
in middle school.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.451
So you still play?

04:37.538 --> 04:39.931
No, but I air-drum
to Genesis,

04:40.018 --> 04:41.890
like, all the time
and I'm, like, sick at it.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.284
Okay, we got our drummer!
It's fate!

04:44.371 --> 04:46.547
Seriously,
what are the chances
you end up with a roommate

04:46.634 --> 04:47.635
who likes the idea
of drumming?

04:47.722 --> 04:49.289
This literally
can't fail.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.813
Dude,
look at her go!

04:51.900 --> 04:54.468
That probably sounds
amazing.

04:54.555 --> 04:57.427
ADULT ADAM: And so,
my sister happily threw away
her college education.

04:57.514 --> 04:58.733
Meanwhile,
my dad was about to learn

04:58.820 --> 05:01.736
that Barry was one throw away from baseball glory.

05:01.823 --> 05:05.305
Father! In preparation
for my pitch at the Vet,

05:05.392 --> 05:08.133
it is essential I have
a top-of-the-line radar gun

05:08.220 --> 05:10.179
that clocks
my explosive fastball.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.224
How are you throwing out
the first pitch
at a Phillies game?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.705
W.I.P. call-in contest.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.707
My boy's throwing out
the first pitch?

05:16.794 --> 05:19.406
Here, take my card.
Buy whatever you need.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.016
I cannot wait
to show Mike Schmidt

05:21.103 --> 05:23.453
the nasty aspirin tablet
I fire-hose in there!

05:23.540 --> 05:26.151
You only have one chance
to dazzle the Phillies
with your arm. Am I right?

05:26.238 --> 05:27.936
That's what
I was thinking

05:28.023 --> 05:30.330
'cause there is a world
where they see my bazooka

05:30.417 --> 05:32.462
and I immediately
get a contract
and uniform.

05:32.549 --> 05:35.160
65,000 people at the Vet

05:35.247 --> 05:37.206
are gonna see
that flamethrower
of yours.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.730
I'm sorry. I was just
deturding some shrimp

05:39.817 --> 05:41.950
and I couldn't help
but overhear.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.604
65,000 people?

05:43.691 --> 05:45.214
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.390
My boy's gonna make
the Goldberg name proud.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.784
I won't let you down, Dad.
I'm gonna bring the thunder.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.047
I cannot believe
you're gonna be standing

05:52.134 --> 05:54.005
on the same grass
with Mike Schmidt.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.267
It's too much!

05:55.355 --> 05:57.792
"Same grass"?
We're gonna be
on the same team.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.533
Can you imagine sharing
a locker room with Schmidty?

05:59.620 --> 06:01.578
I'll grow a sweet mustache
to match his

06:01.665 --> 06:03.624
and then we'll date
twin weather girls.

06:03.711 --> 06:06.366
Promise me you'll grow
a 'stache. Promise!

06:06.453 --> 06:09.151
Murray,
are you sure about this?

06:09.238 --> 06:12.241
You know how Barry caves under
the slightest pressure.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.199
I played baseball
in high school.
Barry's got this.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.853
That makes no sense!

06:15.940 --> 06:17.681
One thing has nothing to do
with the other.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.597
Every day,
my moron kids come in here

06:20.684 --> 06:23.208
asking me for money
for the dumbest of dreams.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.210
Finally, I found one
I can get behind.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.648
But you don't
actually believe

06:27.735 --> 06:30.259
that Barry will be scouted
onto the Phillies.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.435
Of course not,
but you never know.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.219
So you do think so?
Not a chance!

06:34.306 --> 06:35.525
Unless it happens.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.092
Okay, kind of giving me
mixed signals here.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.702
Listen to my words.

06:38.789 --> 06:42.967
I know Barry will never play
for the Phillies,

06:43.054 --> 06:46.884
although crazier things
have happened.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.016
ADULT ADAM:
For the first time ever,

06:48.103 --> 06:50.279
my mom was doubting one of her precious children.

06:50.366 --> 06:53.630
As for Erica, she was certain of her rock 'n' roll destiny.

06:53.717 --> 06:57.460
A-one, two.
A-one, two, three, four.

06:57.547 --> 07:00.071
That's sounded
awesome, guys!

07:00.158 --> 07:02.247
That's, like,
a totally tight intro.

07:02.334 --> 07:04.162
What a crazy-productive
first day.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.425
I mean,
we decided on our look.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.861
Super-feminine but tough.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.732
And our band name,
"The Tangles."

07:08.819 --> 07:11.735
It, like, captures who we are,
but also doesn't, at all.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.433
Now all that's left
is the easy part,

07:13.520 --> 07:14.956
writing a totally original
hit song

07:15.043 --> 07:16.784
that changes
rock 'n' roll forever.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.960
Actually, I've been
working on a little riff.Let's hear it.

07:21.919 --> 07:25.532
♪♪

07:25.619 --> 07:26.837
Keep going.
I think I got something.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.360
♪♪

07:28.448 --> 07:31.189
♪ I enjoy rockin' out

07:31.276 --> 07:34.366
♪ So put another tape
in the boom box, baby

07:34.454 --> 07:37.065
ADULT ADAM: Within seconds,
The Tangles stumbled upon
an epic hit.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.197
But in their excitement,
no one realized

07:39.284 --> 07:42.287
how shockingly similar it was to a little song written by Joan Jett.

07:42.374 --> 07:45.160
♪ I like rockin' out

07:45.247 --> 07:47.815
♪ So come on over
and jam with me ♪

07:47.902 --> 07:50.121
I have chills!

07:50.208 --> 07:52.472
Oh, my God.
Am I crazy,
or is this a hit song?

07:52.559 --> 07:55.126
Oh, my God.
You are not crazy.
It's bad-ass...

07:55.213 --> 07:56.301
Like, oh, my God!

07:56.388 --> 07:58.216
...and totally defines
The Tangles.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.262
Okay, I wasn't gonna mention
this in case we sucked,

08:00.349 --> 08:02.307
but now that we're amazing,
I think it's time

08:02.394 --> 08:04.571
I make a call and get us
a gig at CBGB's.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.747
What?
What?

08:06.834 --> 08:09.140
My Uncle Louie's a bookie
who knows the booker.

08:09.227 --> 08:10.620
Your uncle's
the booker's bookie

08:10.707 --> 08:12.317
at the grittiest rock club
in the world?

08:12.404 --> 08:14.537
Guys, playing New York
has been my dream

08:14.624 --> 08:16.278
ever since we got together
this morning.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.453
We got to make
a bunch of fliers

08:17.540 --> 08:19.760
and rent a van
for all our gear.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.805
Plus we need to make
some super-cute merch
that our fans will demand.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.459
We're gonna need money
and lots of it.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.113
I'll cash in my meal card.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.116
It's like
every decision we make
continues to be perfect.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.553
Ooh, Tangles forever!

08:31.423 --> 08:32.860
COACH MELLOR: Let's go.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.514
Look that ball in the face
and catch it!

08:36.254 --> 08:39.214
No flinching!
Rick, we need to talk.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.999
Lemme guess.
Barry's throwing out the first
pitch and you're worried.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.132
Oh, you know
about the pitch?Everyone does.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.743
He got on the P.A. and assured
us we'd all be forgotten

08:46.830 --> 08:48.440
when he becomes
a Major League star.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.877
Well, he is
throwing out a ball

08:49.964 --> 08:51.661
in front of
Mike Schmidt, so...

08:51.748 --> 08:53.228
There's a small chance,
right?

08:53.315 --> 08:54.577
Wrong.

08:54.664 --> 08:55.926
You see that boy
right there?

08:56.013 --> 08:59.669
That's Ruben Amaro Jr.,
baseball star,

08:59.756 --> 09:02.454
recruited nationally
and currently dominating

09:02.542 --> 09:05.066
seven of his peers with the
sheer power of his rifle arm.

09:06.720 --> 09:10.158
And yet his chances
of making it to the pros
are almost zero.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.551
Wait, what?

09:11.638 --> 09:13.117
If anybody can do it,
it's you, Ruben!

09:13.204 --> 09:15.119
BEVERLY: So if Ruben
might not be a Philly,

09:15.206 --> 09:16.991
what's the best case
for Barry here?

09:17.078 --> 09:18.340
Best case?

09:18.427 --> 09:21.604
Barry uncorks a wild pitch
and blinds a peanut vendor.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.127
I don't get it.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.347
Murray usually destroys
the kids' dreams,

09:25.434 --> 09:28.568
but for some reason,
this one time, he's on board.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.657
Well, unfortunately,
your husband is suffering from

09:30.744 --> 09:33.921
what we in the
athletic community call
"sports goggles."

09:34.008 --> 09:36.358
I heard something crack
inside of me. Oh!

09:36.445 --> 09:38.099
"Sports goggles"
are when a father gets

09:38.186 --> 09:41.363
so swept up by the promise
of his son's athleticism,

09:41.450 --> 09:43.887
he's unable to see
his own child's limitations.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.107
Interesting.
I have never heard of that.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.283
Well, it's not unlike
the thick "mom goggles"

09:48.370 --> 09:50.459
that you strap on every day
that prevents you from seeing

09:50.546 --> 09:53.157
the staggering mediocrity
of your children.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.203
Please.
I would never be so blind

09:55.290 --> 09:57.901
as to think that Barry
could become a Philly.

09:57.988 --> 10:01.818
A professional model, sure,
or doctor or doctor-model.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.124
The point is,
you got to get those

10:03.211 --> 10:04.342
sports goggles
off your husband.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.475
But how?

10:06.562 --> 10:08.477
This is the first time
I've ever seen that
light in his eyes.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.000
If you really
love your son,

10:10.087 --> 10:12.829
you better figure out a way
to snuff that light out.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.788
I'd like to go back
to band now.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.006
COACH MELLOR: No flinching!

10:19.444 --> 10:21.185
ADULT ADAM: My mom
was determined
to protect Barry

10:21.272 --> 10:22.839
from becoming
a laughing stock,

10:22.926 --> 10:25.581
and so began her mission
to shut down the big pitch.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.018
Murray, we have a major issue
we have to talk about
right now.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.411
Sure thing.

10:29.498 --> 10:32.109
Just need another 20 minutes
for the lotion to settle in.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.155
What am I looking at?
Why is this happening?

10:34.242 --> 10:36.810
My pitching coach is loosening
up the ol' slingshot

10:36.897 --> 10:38.768
so I can show
Tug McGraw what's what.

10:38.855 --> 10:42.990
And you're gonna be doing it
in style.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.993
Is that what I think it is?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.864
A Phillies jersey?

10:47.951 --> 10:50.171
I can't wait to call
all my friends and tell them.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.955
It's nothing.
No, Dad.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.696
You made me the happiest boy
in the world.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.743
You know,
I always had a dream...

10:56.830 --> 10:58.614
Mur?
Really gotta talk.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.791
...to one day pitch
for the Phillies
and that never happened.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.620
Really gotta talk.
And now, with you?
You never know.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.796
We don't know, do we?

11:06.883 --> 11:08.885
And that's why I'm here.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.409
I have some information
that suggests we know more
than we think we do...

11:11.496 --> 11:12.889
Oh, God, I see Murray tears.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.108
I can't help it!

11:14.195 --> 11:16.501
No, don't you cry.
If you cry, I'll cry.

11:16.588 --> 11:19.417
I'm just so damn proud.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.681
You know what?
Talk to your mom.
Let me get my bearings.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.900
I... I just...

11:23.987 --> 11:25.206
I wanted to tell Barry,
uh...

11:28.426 --> 11:29.297
Don't pitch.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.648
Did you just call me
a dumb bitch?

11:32.735 --> 11:34.911
No, I said
"don't pitch."

11:34.998 --> 11:36.913
What?
That's even worse!

11:37.000 --> 11:38.132
Look, I spoke to
Coach Mellor.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.134
He said
the most likely outcome here

11:40.221 --> 11:42.484
is that you'll be
a city-wide pariah.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.573
The fish
that have teeth? Yes!

11:44.660 --> 11:45.966
They're the sharks
of the river.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.489
Not "piranha," Barry.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.534
I'm saying you'll be
a laughing stock.

11:49.621 --> 11:52.929
Wow! This is just
so typical of you.

11:53.016 --> 11:56.019
Beverly Goldberg, always
stepping on her kids' dreams.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.543
No, I do the opposite!
Everyone knows that!

11:58.630 --> 12:00.067
Murray, back me up here.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.460
I have to side with Bar
on this one.

12:02.547 --> 12:05.072
You know, if I don't
support his talent,

12:05.159 --> 12:06.682
then I have failed
as a father.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.553
No!
That's the thing that I say.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.468
"I failed as a mother."

12:10.555 --> 12:12.122
You said it, not me.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.692
What's up, Manhattan?
We are The Tangles!

12:16.779 --> 12:19.303
Whoo!
I'm dating the lead singer
and I took a bus up here

12:19.390 --> 12:22.089
at the drop of a hat 'cause
I wanted to be supportive!

12:22.176 --> 12:23.873
We're gonna play now.
I love you.

It was catchy,
it was rocking,

No. This club has

No cover bands.
What?

13:03.652 --> 13:06.263

it sounded so familiar.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.765
Okay, well...

13:29.852 --> 13:31.593
That happens,
but you know what?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.551
We promise,
there is no band

13:33.638 --> 13:36.076
as groundbreaking
as The Tangles.I agree.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.381
Now that you say it
out loud,

13:37.468 --> 13:38.992
our name sounds
a lot like The Bangles.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.776
Also true.
ERICA: Okay.

13:40.863 --> 13:44.345
Well, aside from ripping off
our song and name,

13:44.432 --> 13:46.564
our style and look
is totally original.

13:46.651 --> 13:49.393
You do realize that you're all
dressed like Madonna, right?

13:49.480 --> 13:51.831
You're supposed to be on
our side, Uncle Louie!

13:51.918 --> 13:53.180
Just play
something else.

13:53.267 --> 13:56.313
Stop pressuring us.
I am freaking out.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.620
Okay, don't freak out.
We got this, girls.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.187
Two, three, four.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.059
We got nothin'.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.322
I love you.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.758
ADULT ADAM: As The Tangles
flamed out,

14:06.846 --> 14:09.109
my brother's baseball career
was heating up

14:09.196 --> 14:12.112
and that meant locking down
the perfect look
for his Topps trading card.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.027
But not everyone around him
was stoking the flames.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.680
Whatcha boys doing?

14:15.767 --> 14:19.162
We're working on some poses
for our rookie baseball card.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.251
I like the stance.
Very rugged.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.514
Bup, bup, only people
who believe in me

14:23.601 --> 14:26.213
are allowed to comment
on how rugged this stance is.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.085
About that.
I'm sorry I panicked.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.870
Of course
I believe in you, boopie.

14:30.957 --> 14:34.830
In fact, I bought you
some balls so Mama
can see that arm cannon.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.701
All right, 17.
Go get your glove.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.660
Wow, we haven't had
a game of catch

14:38.747 --> 14:40.444
since I got kicked out
of t-ball for throwing
the bat.

14:40.531 --> 14:43.447
Ooh! You put some hot sauce
on that one.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.797
Here comes some cheese
with extra hot sauce.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.669
See, Bevy?
Kid's a natural.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.671
He really is.

14:49.758 --> 14:52.892
You know, I cannot wait
to watch you pitch
from 60 feet, 6 inches.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.676
Why would we do that?

14:54.763 --> 14:58.071
'Cause that's how far
the mound is from home plate.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.334
I... I thought they just threw
from where it feels right.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.031
Come on. You got this.
Back it up.

15:03.424 --> 15:06.209
Okay.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.080
Go back a little further,
schmoopie.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.170
Okay, halfway there.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.782
Ah, keep going.
Almost there.

15:13.869 --> 15:14.914
And stop.

15:16.828 --> 15:19.092
Oh, I forgot
I marked it with tape.

15:19.179 --> 15:20.571
Anyway, let 'er rip!

15:22.225 --> 15:24.880
Man,
looks closer on TV!

15:24.967 --> 15:27.187
You got this, 17!
Smoke it in here! Let's go!

15:29.841 --> 15:31.931
Oop.

15:32.018 --> 15:35.021
It's got the height!
I just need control!

15:35.108 --> 15:38.459
Just a warm-up.
Are you sure it's this far?

15:38.546 --> 15:41.636
Kind of seems
like it'd be very taxing
on a pitcher's arm!

15:41.723 --> 15:44.160
No, that's right.
I looked it up in the library.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.379
Okay.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.424
Here comes the heat
for real this time.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.209
♪♪

15:55.519 --> 15:56.999
This is bad.
Yes, it is.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.784
Whoo!

15:59.871 --> 16:02.135
When I throw,
I feel God's power!

16:03.266 --> 16:04.920
We can't let him
do this.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.356
We're
Ooh.

16:06.443 --> 16:07.618
ADULT ADAM: My dad
finally saw the light.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.970
As for The Tangles, they were facing their dark future.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.058
I don't know what's worse.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.407
The fact that
we bombed so hard

16:13.494 --> 16:15.148
or the fact that we blew
all our money on merch.

16:15.235 --> 16:18.064
Way to make a splash,
rock stars!

16:18.151 --> 16:20.588
Geoff, I love you,
but please don't try
to spin this disaster.

16:20.675 --> 16:21.981
Okay, so you got
a little ambitious,

16:22.068 --> 16:23.460
but forget about the merch.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.636
At the end of the day,
you're still in college

16:25.723 --> 16:27.769
with a roof over your head
and food in your tummy.

16:27.856 --> 16:29.249
I cashed in my meal plan.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.555
Uh-huh, that makes sense,
but why would you do that?

16:31.642 --> 16:33.862
But it's fine because
it's all about the sacrifice.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.255
Just ask The Beatles.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.170
We failed out,
which at the time made sense

16:37.257 --> 16:38.562
because we were
gonna be rock stars.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.173
Say what now?

16:42.088 --> 16:45.004
LAINEY: And...
Someone stole the van.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.483
We are not good
at this.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.706
ADULT ADAM: My dad
was desperate
to protect Barry,

16:51.793 --> 16:53.969
so he turned to a seasoned
athletic scrub, me.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.710
Hey, pal.
Looking spry.

16:55.797 --> 16:56.885
It's a Power Pad.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.626
Look at my son,
the sports nut.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.541
It's more like
tap-dancing than sports.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.457
