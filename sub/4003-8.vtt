50:33.333 --> 50:34.500
YOU'RE TAKING LEAD.

50:34.500 --> 50:37.000
- MOTHERFUCKER, REALLY?

50:37.000 --> 50:39.333
WELL, WHAT ABOUT LUNDY'S CASE?
- THAT'S MY CASE NOW.

50:39.333 --> 50:43.750
DON'T WORRY, I'M GONNA FIND
THE SHITHEAD THAT SHOT YOU.

50:43.750 --> 50:45.000
- OH, OH, WHOA...

50:45.000 --> 50:47.208
- OH, ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M F--I'M FINE.

50:47.208 --> 50:48.375
- YOU OKAY?

50:48.375 --> 50:50.083
- [laughs]

50:50.083 --> 50:54.041
- WELL, WE'RE DONE HERE.
- WE'RE DONE.

50:54.041 --> 50:58.041
- MORGAN, UPDATE THE SQUAD
AT 3:00, PLEASE.

51:00.375 --> 51:02.333
- GLAD THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
LAST NIGHT.

51:06.125 --> 51:08.542
- ANY REGRETS?

51:08.542 --> 51:13.750
- THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE
BREAKFAST TOGETHER.

51:17.709 --> 51:21.542
- AT LEAST
I'LL GET TRINITY...

51:21.542 --> 51:22.667
PROMISE.

51:30.750 --> 51:36.333
- I'VE KILLED AN INNOCENT MAN,
AND I'VE SAVED A GUILTY ONE.

51:36.333 --> 51:40.041
I WON'T MAKE
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

51:40.041 --> 51:41.458
IS THAT THE PURPOSE
OF REMORSE,

51:41.458 --> 51:46.834
TO KEEP YOU
FROM REPEATING MISTAKES?

51:46.834 --> 51:51.083
- YOU'RE WATCHING ME.

51:51.083 --> 51:55.000
- I'M JUST CONCERNED.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
- NO NEED.
I WAS CONFUSED BEFORE.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.750
- BUT YOU'RE NOT ANYMORE.

51:59.750 --> 52:02.417
- NO.
EMBARRASSED, PERHAPS.

52:02.417 --> 52:05.250
IN FACT, I'D APPRECIATE IT

52:05.250 --> 52:08.542
IF YOU'D THINK OF
THIS WEEKEND'S EVENTS AS A...

52:08.542 --> 52:10.750
A LITTLE ACCIDENT.

52:10.750 --> 52:14.583
- YOU STEPPED OFF A ROOF.

52:14.583 --> 52:18.208
- IT WAS A MISTAKE.

52:18.208 --> 52:22.959
WE ALL MAKE THEM.

52:22.959 --> 52:24.458
DON'T WORRY.

52:24.458 --> 52:27.208
YOUR ACCIDENT
WILL NEVER BE SPOKEN OF BY ME.

52:27.208 --> 52:29.250
TO ERR IS HUMAN.

52:32.417 --> 52:37.417
LITTLE EARLY
FOR A DRUNK-DRIVING CHECKPOINT.

52:38.709 --> 52:40.750
- LOOKS LIKE
ONE OF DEBRA'S DNA SWEEPS.

52:40.750 --> 52:43.959
- STAND OVER HERE,
SIR, PLEASE.

52:43.959 --> 52:48.083
- YOU, SIR,
PULL OVER HERE.

52:48.083 --> 52:50.959
- STEP ON OUT OF THE CAR,
SIR, PLEASE.

52:50.959 --> 52:52.500
- YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THIS
ON THE RADIO.

52:52.500 --> 52:56.959
THE POLICE ARE LOOKING
FOR SOME HUGE SERIAL KILLER.

52:58.500 --> 53:03.375
THEY HAVE HIS DNA.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A MATCH.

53:03.375 --> 53:05.125
- SOUNDS SCARY.

53:05.125 --> 53:08.542
- EXACTLY HOW MUCH DO YOU
WANT TO LIVE, ARTHUR?

53:10.625 --> 53:13.250
- I THINK THIS GENTLEMAN IN
THE RED CAR HAS THE RIGHT IDEA.

53:13.250 --> 53:17.834
THIS LINE IS ENDLESS.

53:17.834 --> 53:19.709
WHAT SAY WE TAKE
THE SCENIC ROUTE?

53:19.709 --> 53:23.959
- YEAH, SURE, ARTHUR.

53:25.542 --> 53:28.458
- A CHANGED MAN
AT PEACE WITH HIMSELF.

53:32.041 --> 53:37.792
MAYBE ONLY MONSTERS
FEEL NO REGRET.

53:37.792 --> 53:43.875
IF ERRING IS HUMAN,
THEN REMORSE MUST BE TOO.

53:43.875 --> 53:47.750
WAIT, DOES THAT
MAKE ME HUMAN?

53:47.750 --> 53:49.792
HUH.
