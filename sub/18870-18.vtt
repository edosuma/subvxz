WEBVTT

00:04.037 --> 00:05.505
This is wrong.

00:05.572 --> 00:06.740
I'm going to Paris.

00:06.806 --> 00:09.075
Garrett's sending you
to cover the hacking story?

00:09.142 --> 00:10.310
I asked to go.

00:10.377 --> 00:14.347
It had been 44 years
since I laid eyes on Frank,

00:14.414 --> 00:17.317
and when you re-enlisted,
I was in a bind.

00:17.384 --> 00:20.120
- Pregnant?
- Frank is your blood.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.455
- These came for you after you left.
- From Aaliyah?

00:22.522 --> 00:24.457
No, they're from Justin.

00:26.659 --> 00:29.329
- Please, don't go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

00:29.396 --> 00:30.497
This is for you.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.515
Hello? This is Pauletta. Who is this?

00:50.216 --> 00:52.452
It keeps not ringing.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.502
She ain't here anymore, Frank.
You can stop calling.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.505
Shit.

01:17.444 --> 01:18.378
Damn it.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.416
Damn it, I said stop calling this house!

01:23.483 --> 01:26.686
Dad, hey, it's me.
What's got you worked up so early?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.054
Pauletta!

01:28.955 --> 01:32.358
Some pranksters keep calling
and hanging up.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.429
Yeah, no, I was just checking in.
I hadn't spoken to you in days.

01:36.496 --> 01:39.632
- I was hoping you didn't get cold feet.
- Why would I get cold feet?

01:39.699 --> 01:44.070
Because you're about to share your famous
rib recipe with the entire world.

01:44.137 --> 01:46.206
You're talking about your show.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.341
Of course, I'm talking
about my show, Dad.

01:48.408 --> 01:51.945
Everyone else has paraded their parents,
talking up their summer traditions.

01:52.011 --> 01:54.080
It's time the Patterson's
show how it's done.

01:54.147 --> 01:55.248
Right. Right.

01:55.315 --> 01:59.052
You know the car's picking you up
this afternoon, right?

01:59.118 --> 02:00.820
Of course.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.722
You know your mother. She's already got

02:02.789 --> 02:04.891
her suitcase
sitting by the door ready to go.

02:06.693 --> 02:07.894
Not to worry.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.832
- Frank.
- So, it's true.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.535
Paul did ask you to leave the house.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.576
Why didn't you tell me, Helen?

02:23.643 --> 02:25.745
Don't take it personally, Frank.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.947
I just needed time.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.215
I know.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.384
You and Paul have been together
for a long time.

02:31.451 --> 02:32.552
A lifetime.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.455
But we aren't getting any younger.

02:35.522 --> 02:38.625
I agree. I just need a couple of days.

02:38.691 --> 02:40.226
That's all I'm asking for you.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.828
Okay. Fine.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.264
But at the end of the week,

02:44.330 --> 02:46.099
I want you to come
to New Orleans with me.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.701
- New Orleans?
- I want us to be together.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.539
Finally, after all these years.

02:55.141 --> 02:56.175
Well...

02:56.776 --> 03:00.380
At the time, there was nothing
I wanted to hear more, but...

03:00.880 --> 03:03.283
Frank, I can't talk about this right now.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.819
I'm trying to get out of here
to go to New York to Pauletta's show.

03:06.886 --> 03:09.322
I understand. I understand, Helen.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.092
I don't wanna make things
more difficult for you.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.663
I'll give you your space.
But when you get back from New York,

03:17.397 --> 03:20.767
I want you to think about
starting a new life with me.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.103
Yeah, I'll talk to my agent.

03:26.639 --> 03:27.807
Okay.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.876
Yeah, it was great talking to you, too.

03:30.877 --> 03:31.878
Okay, thanks.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.915
Weren't those Gumbel's producers?

03:35.982 --> 03:37.850
What did they say?

03:39.185 --> 03:41.354
The official call's on Monday,

03:41.421 --> 03:44.490
but they want me to host
a new sports show they're developing.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.260
- My God!
- I get to finish out the season,

03:47.327 --> 03:50.530
but once I make my retirement official,
they'll make the announcement.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.565
<i>My God, congratulations, papi!</i>

03:56.235 --> 03:57.770
I'm so happy for you!

03:58.771 --> 04:01.908
This means I'm not gonna have you
as a producer to coach me anymore.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.676
We'll still prep together,

04:04.310 --> 04:06.412
and you'll have a new EP.

04:06.813 --> 04:09.682
- Come on, it's good.
- But I want someone like "Hamptons."

04:10.416 --> 04:11.818
You mean Garrett?

04:11.884 --> 04:14.053
Yeah. I mean, he's like you. He gets me.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.388
He loves sports...

04:15.455 --> 04:16.956
My God.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.025
What?

04:20.126 --> 04:21.828
That's genius.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.529
My gosh.

04:24.263 --> 04:26.499
Getting Garrett as your new showrunner.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.336
- He'd never leave GDU. That'd be crazy.
- You don't know that.

04:30.403 --> 04:33.272
You could put that out
to the producers and see what they say.

04:33.339 --> 04:36.676
- You're miles ahead, aren't you?
- I'll explain it at breakfast.

04:36.743 --> 04:40.613
<i>We'll have arroz con gandules,
huevos fritos, olvídate.</i>

04:40.680 --> 04:42.115
Come on, why not smoothies?

04:42.181 --> 04:43.216
A smoothie? No.

04:43.916 --> 04:46.586
You don't want "Big Papi"
rolling into the new show, do you?

04:46.653 --> 04:50.690
No, no. When you get back to your place,
you can blend all the smoothies you want.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.026
<i>This is Kara's kitchen, papi, okay?</i>

04:53.092 --> 04:55.662
<i>We're gonna have
some leftover arroz con gandules.</i>

04:56.229 --> 04:58.731
<i>Huevos fritos. We've gotta celebrate!</i>

05:04.904 --> 05:06.639
Don't look at me that way.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.508
We've got a plane to catch.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.810
Your suitcase's packed and ready?

05:13.079 --> 05:15.982
No, my bags are not packed and ready.

05:18.317 --> 05:19.385
I just forgot.

05:19.452 --> 05:22.422
Well, if you'd answered my calls,
I would've reminded you.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.157
- I'll pack your bags.
- No, no.

05:24.223 --> 05:26.659
I'll pack my own damn bag,
thank you very much.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.430
Fine.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.367
But before you do,
we need to speak with Patrick.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.503
No, what we need to do
is forget the whole damn trip.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.940
But Pauletta is expecting us.

05:42.408 --> 05:45.745
We can't go on television pretending
that we're a happily married couple.

05:45.812 --> 05:46.846
That's a farce!

05:46.913 --> 05:49.782
So, you want our daughter,

05:50.483 --> 05:53.152
the one black woman on the entire show,

05:53.219 --> 05:56.689
to be the only host
that doesn't have family coming in?

05:58.858 --> 06:01.194
This is a big deal to Pauletta.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.796
Patrick is on very shaky ground.

06:04.430 --> 06:07.867
We've rocked the very foundation
that he's worked so hard to build.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.303
But that's the reason
we need to talk to him.

06:12.572 --> 06:13.573
Patrick!

06:16.909 --> 06:18.544
Y'all still going to New York?

06:18.611 --> 06:21.247
Pauletta ain't dumb.
She'll smell the bullshit a mile away.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.749
Probably already does.

06:22.815 --> 06:25.017
You watch your mouth
while in this house.

06:25.084 --> 06:26.686
I don't care how mad you are.

06:27.186 --> 06:30.857
Now we're going to tell her
when we arrive.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.493
We just wanna know
that you're all right while we're gone.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.027
Don't worry about me.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.130
- I know this is a...
- I said don't worry.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.699
Y'all go and have fun in New York.

06:42.268 --> 06:43.302
Patrick.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.777
Mom, you're here!

07:26.312 --> 07:27.380
Come on in.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.448
I'm so glad to be here.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.083
I'm glad you're here.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.086
Oh, my...

07:35.555 --> 07:38.791
Look at this fancy place.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.226
Mom.

07:41.594 --> 07:42.762
Where's Dad?

07:42.829 --> 07:45.264
And why didn't you leave
your luggage at the hotel?

07:45.331 --> 07:47.834
Your show wouldn't pay
for two hotel rooms.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.870
And why would you and Dad
need two hotel rooms?

07:51.437 --> 07:54.674
You guys had an argument
on the flight in or something?

07:54.740 --> 07:57.810
No, nothing like that.

07:57.877 --> 08:01.047
Okay, so, then what is it, exactly, Mom?

08:03.349 --> 08:04.684
Pauletta...

08:06.452 --> 08:08.988
Your father is asking for a divorce,

08:09.622 --> 08:12.558
and I've decided to give it to him.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.277
For the first time in my life,
I'm speechless. I just...

08:31.344 --> 08:35.014
Your mom cheated on your dad?
And your dad wants a divorce?

08:35.081 --> 08:37.650
And Patrick has a different father. Yeah.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.685
God, none of this makes any sense.

08:39.752 --> 08:42.021
I can't help but feel
like I'm partly to blame.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.190
What? What do you mean?

08:44.757 --> 08:46.926
The way my mom describes Frank...

08:46.993 --> 08:48.928
He's like an addiction.

08:48.995 --> 08:52.798
And here I go breaking up with Lee
for Justin? My mom fell off the wagon.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.835
Okay, girl, how did you just manage
to make this all about you?

08:55.902 --> 09:00.206
You and your mother are two
grown-ass women making your life choices.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.874
Maybe you're right.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.509
But, silver lining.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.411
I have an idea
for the prime time special.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.513
- I'm listening.
- Black women.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.549
Are they destined to be alone,
and is it their fault?

09:11.250 --> 09:14.654
- It could be a hard sell for the network.
- Jesus, don't shoot me when I'm down.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.490
I'm not shooting you,
and you're not down.

09:17.556 --> 09:19.759
Keep your chin up
and we'll keep discussing.

09:20.559 --> 09:21.761
I've got a conference call.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.407
- Helen.
- Hello, Frank.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.542
<i>Aren't you due to go
on the morning show?</i>

09:36.609 --> 09:38.444
I'm on my way to the studio now.

09:38.511 --> 09:39.545
Everything okay?

09:39.979 --> 09:41.280
Frank...

09:42.949 --> 09:44.517
there's something you should know.

09:45.484 --> 09:48.587
You're not gonna wanna take me
to New Orleans with you when you hear it.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.189
What is it, Helen?

09:50.256 --> 09:51.524
I lied to you, Frank.

09:52.658 --> 09:57.263
<i>Years ago, when you asked me
about my eldest son, Patrick.</i>

09:57.663 --> 09:59.398
I didn't tell you the truth.

09:59.465 --> 10:00.833
Patrick?

10:03.235 --> 10:04.503
What you're saying is...

10:05.404 --> 10:06.639
Is Patrick...?

10:07.139 --> 10:08.207
Yes, Frank.

10:09.909 --> 10:12.478
Well, see, after you left town

10:13.179 --> 10:14.947
<i>I found out I was pregnant.</i>

10:15.581 --> 10:18.684
<i>Now, my plan was to leave Hattiesburg.</i>

10:19.118 --> 10:20.619
<i>But you know yourself,</i>

10:21.087 --> 10:24.590
a pregnant black woman,
unwed, in the South,

10:24.657 --> 10:26.492
it was just not a good time.

10:26.559 --> 10:30.029
Now I know why you and Paul
were in such a hurry to get married.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.531
Well, I knew that he fancied me and...

10:33.466 --> 10:35.434
I wanted my child to have a father.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.371
And you knew I wasn't ready for that.

10:39.572 --> 10:40.773
To be a father.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.475
<i>Does Patrick know?</i>

10:44.810 --> 10:46.412
Well, he does now.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.983
He also knows
about your troubles with drinking.

10:53.419 --> 10:54.820
<i>So everything is out in the open.</i>

10:55.821 --> 11:00.426
It's been a terrible burden
to carry for so many years.

11:01.627 --> 11:05.398
<i>I guess you're not gonna want
to have anything to do with me now.</i>

11:07.066 --> 11:08.134
No.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.202
No, on the contrary.

11:11.470 --> 11:12.638
<i>I'm happy.</i>

11:12.705 --> 11:13.739
<i>We have a son.</i>

11:14.673 --> 11:16.409
We have a son together.

11:16.475 --> 11:19.678
That makes me want you more than ever
to come to New Orleans with me.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.888
Can you keep an eye out for my family?
They should be here any minute.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.125
Hi, this is Mary Jane Paul.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.661
Hello, Ms. Paul, this is Dr. Taketa.

11:37.263 --> 11:38.397
Hi, yeah.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.934
I wanted to go over a couple of things
before today's appointment.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.236
Appointment?

11:44.303 --> 11:47.239
We can reschedule if today doesn't work.
But if you and Lee

11:47.306 --> 11:50.176
wanna do the frozen embryo transfer
before the end of summer...

11:50.242 --> 11:52.078
That was the plan, wasn't it?

11:52.711 --> 11:54.847
<i>We can wait, if now isn't a good time.</i>

11:56.315 --> 11:58.117
No, no, it's not that. It's...

11:58.584 --> 12:00.086
My boyfriend, Lee, and I, we...

12:01.087 --> 12:02.788
<i>- We broke up.
- I'm sorry to heart that.</i>

12:02.855 --> 12:06.225
Did the two of you determine
what you'll do with the stored embryos?

12:06.292 --> 12:08.694
It was sort of abrupt,
you know, the break-up.

12:08.761 --> 12:10.262
We can continue storing them.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.164
We would need both of you
to agree to that.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.468
Yeah, I don't know if Lee
has this appointment in his calendar.

12:15.534 --> 12:17.570
- We'll follow up with him.
- Great. Yeah.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.472
- I'll see you this afternoon.
- All right.

12:23.476 --> 12:27.012
Pauletta, somebody by the name
of Hippity-Hop said this was your office.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.615
There's my girl!

12:29.682 --> 12:30.616
God.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.053
I am so glad that you came early.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.123
Yeah, I wanted a minute alone
before your mother arrived.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.425
How are you handling the news?

12:39.925 --> 12:41.160
To be honest?

12:41.794 --> 12:44.396
I'm shocked. I feel numb.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.999
Yes, there's a lot to think about
and a lot to process,

12:47.066 --> 12:48.968
but, darling, to tell you the truth,

12:49.034 --> 12:50.469
it's for the best.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.939
- That can't be true, Dad.
- Yes, it really is.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.342
Good morning.

12:56.775 --> 12:58.911
The Patterson's are all here now.

12:59.845 --> 13:00.913
Hi, Mom!

13:01.814 --> 13:02.848
Yes.

13:02.915 --> 13:06.085
My goodness, look at this office.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.455
Pauletta, it's just gorgeous.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.856
Yeah?

13:10.923 --> 13:13.993
Okay, well,
now that I have you both here

13:14.059 --> 13:17.129
I have to ask,
given everything that's going on,

13:17.196 --> 13:19.331
are you guys gonna be okay doing this?

13:19.832 --> 13:20.966
Well, of course.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.768
Your father and I have discussed it,

13:22.835 --> 13:24.503
and we're all ready, right, Paul?

13:24.803 --> 13:25.905
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.575
Letta, we are so proud of you,

13:29.642 --> 13:33.679
and I'm just so happy that we can do this
as a family, together.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.582
Speaking of family. Have either of you
heard from Patrick?

13:37.016 --> 13:39.919
I tried to text him last night,
this morning. No reply.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.589
Well, I did call him last night
to let him know that we arrived safely.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.224
Me, too. I haven't heard anything.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.995
Atlanta in the house!

13:50.062 --> 13:51.797
- Girl, it's been a long time.
- Hi!

13:51.864 --> 13:54.700
- Good to see you, too.
- Look at you.

13:54.767 --> 13:58.037
- And I love this jacket. It's gorgeous.
- Thank you.

13:58.103 --> 14:00.639
Thank you. You guys look amazing.

14:00.706 --> 14:03.576
Are you ready
for your national TV debut?

14:03.642 --> 14:06.445
- I'm ready as I'll ever be.
- Good. Okay.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.547
Well, at least Paul will be cooking.

14:08.614 --> 14:12.117
I'm gonna be standing around
trying not to look like a fool.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.986
No, it's gonna be a great segment.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.155
And I will see the two of you
after the show, okay?

14:16.222 --> 14:17.556
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.960
Excuse me. Mary Jane,
it's time to start the show.

14:24.063 --> 14:25.197
Okay.

14:25.965 --> 14:26.932
All right, well.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.701
Don't worry.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.769
I'm gonna be doing most of the talking,

14:30.836 --> 14:33.339
and asking all the questions.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.174
You do what you do.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.508
We'll follow your lead.

14:36.575 --> 14:38.077
- Here we go.
- Yes.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.282
Hey, gang, thanks for a great session.
That's what has to be done.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.451
You throw it onto the table
and I appreciate it.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.353
Let's end with our mantra.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.655
Grant me serenity to accept the things

14:49.722 --> 14:51.090
that I cannot change,

14:51.156 --> 14:53.525
courage to change the things that I can,

14:53.592 --> 14:55.794
and the wisdom to know the difference.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.029
Give yourself a hand.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.867
- Call each other if you need help.
- Thank you.

15:01.934 --> 15:02.968
We're family.

15:05.471 --> 15:08.407
It isn't pretty,
but that's what gonna happen.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.313
Patrick?

15:15.381 --> 15:17.049
I hope you don't mind me

15:17.116 --> 15:18.617
dropping in on you like this,

15:18.684 --> 15:20.653
but these are unusual circumstances.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.758
I thought maybe we could grab
a cup of coffee, have a chat.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.159
You wanna talk?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.461
And you chose to show up here?

15:29.528 --> 15:31.397
Your mother broke your anonymity.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.499
Yeah, mom thinks the rules
don't apply to her.

15:33.565 --> 15:36.235
- You can't tell Helen what to do.
- You got that right.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.837
But I'm not some school boy
looking for a pat on the back.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.739
Yeah, but neither am I.

15:41.473 --> 15:42.675
So, what do you say?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.448
Mary Jane, green room, 9-1-1.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.151
<i>We should never have left Patrick alone.</i>

15:52.217 --> 15:53.986
Even Niecy hasn't heard from him.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.854
- Listen to you?
- Yes, listen to me!

15:55.921 --> 15:57.389
Mom, Dad, please, stop!

15:58.090 --> 15:59.758
Have you lost your damn mind?

15:59.825 --> 16:01.460
- Yes! Yes!
- Mary Jane!

16:01.527 --> 16:03.595
- You're driving me...
- You're crazy already.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.331
Mary Jane.

16:05.864 --> 16:08.334
You cannot put your parents
on TV like this.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.405
Mom, Mom, are you...

16:13.472 --> 16:15.441
No, no. Mary Jane, listen.

16:15.507 --> 16:16.875
No, no. Look at me.

16:16.942 --> 16:19.044
Your dad needs to do this segment alone.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.780
Do you want me to go in
and break the news to him?

16:21.847 --> 16:23.315
No, I...

16:23.382 --> 16:24.850
- I'll do it myself.
- Okay.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.621
Dad?

16:32.491 --> 16:33.625
- Kara!
- Yes?

16:33.692 --> 16:35.961
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's perfect.

16:36.028 --> 16:39.064
- I was going over some details with them.
- Should I go and meet them?

16:39.131 --> 16:40.833
No, let's wait until after the show

16:40.899 --> 16:43.469
because Mrs. Patterson,
she's got a little stage fright.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.171
And Mary Jane's dad's gonna
do the segment by himself.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.073
- Good call.
- Hey.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.176
Have you heard Orlando's news?

16:51.243 --> 16:53.078
- Isn't it amazing?
- What news?

16:53.579 --> 16:55.614
Well, it's not official yet,

16:55.681 --> 16:59.785
but Gumbel's producers want him to host
a new show they're developing.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.587
- What?
- Yep.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.556
Does this mean
now they know he's retiring?

17:06.225 --> 17:08.594
He's gonna announce it
at the end of the season.

17:08.660 --> 17:09.962
Here? On GDU?

17:10.028 --> 17:12.531
Of course. I wouldn't let him
announce it anywhere else.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.799
- That's amazing!
- I know.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.067
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.702
- Are you ready?
- Let's do this.

17:16.769 --> 17:17.870
All right.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.038
How are you doing, mama?

17:21.707 --> 17:23.409
Okay, that's my girl.

17:23.475 --> 17:24.610
We're live in five.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.251
Welcome back, everyone
to "Great Day USA."

17:32.317 --> 17:35.487
I'm Mary Jane Paul
and this is my father, Paul Patterson.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.688
Hello, everybody!

17:36.755 --> 17:39.625
One of my fondest memories
of those hot Atlanta summers

17:39.691 --> 17:41.326
<i>were our backyard barbeques,</i>

17:41.393 --> 17:44.263
<i>and a key component
were my dad's baby back ribs.</i>

17:44.763 --> 17:47.166
The barbeque sauce
is what made it special.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.535
<i>It was something I perfected
over many, many years.</i>

17:49.601 --> 17:51.403
My father is being modest.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.239
This is the best barbeque sauce
in the South.

17:54.306 --> 17:56.975
And trust me, I've had ribs
up and down the Eastern Seaboard.

17:57.943 --> 18:00.045
Isn't she sweet? We're related.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.315
<i>So, Dad, tell our audience
how you came up with this recipe</i>

18:03.382 --> 18:05.317
that is impossible to duplicate.

18:05.384 --> 18:08.020
Trust me, I have tried
unsuccessfully many times.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.289
I got married young,

18:10.355 --> 18:13.725
and my wife and I didn't have much money,
but we had mouths to feed,

18:13.792 --> 18:16.428
so, I started experimenting
in the kitchen

18:16.495 --> 18:18.530
while she took care of the little ones.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.637
I'm sorry, that's not exactly true.

18:27.139 --> 18:30.776
<i>I came up with a recipe
for the sauce that was...</i>

18:31.944 --> 18:33.612
<i>mediocre, at best.</i>

18:34.379 --> 18:35.881
<i>What made it legendary</i>

18:36.715 --> 18:38.317
was a secret ingredient.

18:39.151 --> 18:40.118
My wife, Helen.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.656
She would sneak
into the kitchen every night

18:45.491 --> 18:47.826
and add a dash of this, a dash of that,

18:47.893 --> 18:49.695
to every batch I made.

18:50.496 --> 18:54.433
<i>I can't even imagine
ever making this recipe without her.</i>

19:00.038 --> 19:01.707
You did a really great job, Dad.

19:02.274 --> 19:05.177
Everyone was really moved
by your story, including me.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.778
Come on, stop.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.414
Seriously.
You turned a silly food segment

19:09.481 --> 19:10.749
into something meaningful.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.285
I appreciate that, Letta,

19:13.352 --> 19:16.154
but I've got to apologize
for upsetting your mother to the point

19:16.221 --> 19:18.156
where she couldn't do
the segment with us.

19:18.857 --> 19:22.794
- Everything turned out in the end, right?
- Yeah, well, I still feel awful about it.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.532
I haven't seen the two of you
argue like that in years.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.668
Are you okay, Dad?

19:32.337 --> 19:34.740
I'll tell you
it's a bitter pill to swallow

19:34.806 --> 19:37.042
knowing after 40 years of being together,

19:38.477 --> 19:40.078
I'm still not enough.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.350
Well...

19:46.084 --> 19:48.420
Before you decide to end the marriage,

19:49.254 --> 19:52.124
you owe it to each other
to have a serious conversation.

19:52.190 --> 19:53.992
We've had plenty of conversations.

19:54.726 --> 19:57.496
I just don't believe it'll do any good
to have another one.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.398
It can't get any worse, Dad.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.503
Amen to that.

20:05.904 --> 20:07.205
So, you'll talk to her?

20:10.108 --> 20:13.211
Now this is a real man's car.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.380
It's a 442.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.382
No, no!

20:17.449 --> 20:19.418
Not just a 442.

20:19.484 --> 20:24.790
It's a 1970 Oldsmobile Nugget Gold 442.

20:26.325 --> 20:29.094
I'm telling you, I've been
into vintage cars most of my life.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.629
I've always wanted one of these.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.631
You know, maybe
it was a good thing that...

20:33.332 --> 20:34.633
I never got one.

20:35.133 --> 20:36.301
I probably would've

20:36.935 --> 20:40.138
totaled it and hurt myself,
not to mention hurting other people.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.374
But after 20 years of being sober.

20:43.475 --> 20:44.643
maybe it's time.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.111
For real.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.479
Twenty years?

20:48.180 --> 20:49.181
Yeah.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.083
Twenty years.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.085
And you?

20:55.053 --> 20:56.221
No judgment, man.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.690
A little over a year.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.527
It could've helped
to have someone who understood

21:02.594 --> 21:03.929
when I was going through it.

21:03.996 --> 21:04.963
Yeah.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.965
I can feel you on that.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.306
Don't hold it against Helen, man.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.642
You were in the dark, too.
You don't have a problem?

21:16.708 --> 21:18.677
I don't harbor grudges anymore, Patrick.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.112
She did the right thing.

21:20.178 --> 21:23.081
Lying to a man about where he comes from?
That was the right thing?

21:23.148 --> 21:25.350
Listen,
back when Helen and I were young,

21:25.984 --> 21:28.487
she gave me an ultimatum.
She wanted me to stop drinking.

21:28.553 --> 21:29.688
What'd you do?

21:30.222 --> 21:33.425
I guess what any respectable
alcoholic would do.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.394
I left her.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.029
Yeah, it sounds about right.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.330
Look...

21:38.397 --> 21:40.298
I didn't know
she was pregnant at the time.

21:40.365 --> 21:43.035
I had my suspicions, but truth be told,
even if I had known

21:43.101 --> 21:44.903
it probably
wouldn't have changed anything.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.472
I knew when she got married
she wasn't in love.

21:48.407 --> 21:49.741
But she loved you.

21:51.877 --> 21:54.846
She figured Paul could give her
more of a life than I could at the time.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.549
She was right.

22:07.626 --> 22:08.727
Hello, Frank.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.662
Helen, how's New York treating you?

22:10.729 --> 22:13.065
The city is treating me fine,

22:13.131 --> 22:15.934
and the weather is hot and humid.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.537
Just like Atlanta. How are you?

22:19.071 --> 22:20.238
<i>Hey, it's all good here.</i>

22:20.305 --> 22:22.107
I had a talk with Patrick today.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.542
<i>I hope you don't mind.</i>

22:23.608 --> 22:26.845
Well, I'll be.
I've been trying to reach him.

22:26.912 --> 22:29.414
You can blame me for that.
I've been talking his ears off.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.149
You always did love to talk.

22:31.216 --> 22:33.318
I haven't had a new audience
in quite a while.

22:33.385 --> 22:34.986
<i>You've been a good mother.</i>

22:35.053 --> 22:37.222
<i>You have raised a good man.</i>

22:37.956 --> 22:39.825
I appreciate that, Frank.

22:41.426 --> 22:43.628
And I'm happy that you two are together.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.299
It warms my heart
that you're getting to know one another.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.635
Well, that should make your decision

22:50.702 --> 22:52.738
a lot easier to come
to New Orleans with me.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.508
I still can't give you
a definite answer, Frank.

22:57.342 --> 22:58.944
<i>I need more time.</i>

22:59.010 --> 23:00.912
<i>I do hope you understand that.</i>

23:00.979 --> 23:03.448
I've waited all these years
for us to be together.

23:03.515 --> 23:06.051
I suppose I can wait
a little while longer.

23:06.451 --> 23:07.519
Thank you.

23:12.624 --> 23:14.292
Hey, so, what did "Hamptons" say?

23:14.359 --> 23:17.395
He has an idea for a show for you
and he wants to run it by you.

23:17.462 --> 23:18.497
Really?

23:18.964 --> 23:21.633
I thought he'd be making
a gazillion dollars at GDU.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.502
Do you think he'd consider leaving?

23:24.035 --> 23:27.405
If you get your producers to make him
a development deal, he might.

23:28.006 --> 23:30.475
Is that just something I bring up
in a phone call or...?

23:31.643 --> 23:33.745
<i>Papi, please, I will coach you.</i>

23:33.812 --> 23:34.980
You know that's what I do.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.682
<i>So, I'll admit it.</i>

23:37.749 --> 23:42.587
It's about a 50/50 chance
Lee actually shows.

23:42.654 --> 23:43.889
I just spoke with him.

23:44.723 --> 23:46.024
You did?

23:46.091 --> 23:47.592
He preferred not to come in today.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.562
Yeah, that's not surprising.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.999
He also does not want to continue
storing the embryos.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.204
Also, not surprising.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.774
That leaves only a few options,
which I can share with you now.

24:03.308 --> 24:05.076
Yeah. Please.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.546
You have two viable embryos.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.214
You can donate them to another couple,

24:09.681 --> 24:12.117
make them available
for medical research,

24:12.184 --> 24:13.451
or have them disposed.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.923
Mr. Truitt was only comfortable
with one of these options.

24:18.757 --> 24:20.025
Disposing them.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.426
He faxed over his signature.

24:21.493 --> 24:24.162
Unfortunately, on this matter,
you both have to agree.

24:25.063 --> 24:27.098
If you're willing to have them disposed,

24:27.165 --> 24:28.867
all we need is your signature.

24:29.768 --> 24:31.937
<i>You missed my doctor's appointment.</i>

24:32.003 --> 24:34.840
<i>If you are not committed to this, to me,</i>

24:34.906 --> 24:37.042
<i>why are we having another baby?</i>

24:37.542 --> 24:40.045
<i>Helen Patterson,
you're just looking for a fight</i>

24:40.111 --> 24:41.646
<i>and I will not give it to you.</i>

24:41.713 --> 24:43.014
<i>- Not tonight.
- Ms. Paul?</i>

24:43.481 --> 24:44.549
Ms. Paul?

24:47.953 --> 24:49.588
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

24:50.956 --> 24:52.257
You can sign here.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.596
Only the embryos will be destroyed.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.599
If you like, you can keep the two eggs
you have frozen in storage.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.401
Would you like to do that?

25:03.802 --> 25:04.870
Yeah.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.038
That'd be great.

25:14.412 --> 25:17.015
Can we also discuss
sperm donors, please?

25:27.592 --> 25:29.461
Where have you been?

25:29.527 --> 25:32.097
Between you and Patrick,
I've been worried sick.

25:32.631 --> 25:35.734
I've been at the fertility clinic
flushing your grandchildren.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.068
The children I made with Lee.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.905
Flushing my grandchildren?

25:39.971 --> 25:43.208
Yeah, I mean,
I didn't want to, of course.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.076
You know, but Lee and I aren't together.

25:45.911 --> 25:48.079
And now I'm with Justin,
so, what could I do, Mom?

25:48.146 --> 25:49.514
You know, it was a pickle.

25:49.581 --> 25:52.117
I'm sorry, can you speak plainly?

25:52.183 --> 25:54.686
You were right, Mom!
How's that for plainly?

25:54.753 --> 25:56.488
I sabotaged things with Lee!

25:56.554 --> 25:59.991
You're right! He was a fine black man
who was madly in love with me.

26:00.058 --> 26:02.627
We could have had a future together.

26:02.694 --> 26:04.930
Pauletta, I thought
you were happy with Justin.

26:04.996 --> 26:07.198
I am happy with Justin, Mom!

26:07.265 --> 26:10.702
I am wildly happy with Justin,

26:10.769 --> 26:14.606
and yet I just picked out a sperm donor
for my future children

26:14.673 --> 26:15.707
and do you know why?

26:16.441 --> 26:20.645
I don't know, I guess insurance,
maybe, in case things don't work out.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.614
But both of us really know what this is.

26:23.114 --> 26:25.717
I'm looking for ways to sabotage
this relationship as well.

26:26.551 --> 26:27.786
And do you know why, Mom?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.355
Because sabotage is my jam.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.824
And I learned from the best.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.093
- You.
- Pauletta Patterson...

26:35.160 --> 26:36.261
Don't you... Don't!

26:37.295 --> 26:40.332
You do not get to roll out
your motherly indignation, not...

26:40.398 --> 26:41.800
Not today, Mom.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.203
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about those...

26:46.838 --> 26:49.174
fights that you and Dad
would have when I was little.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.943
They were about Frank.

26:55.847 --> 26:56.881
Yes.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.351
Why wasn't Dad enough?

27:03.822 --> 27:05.457
For the same reasons...

27:06.491 --> 27:09.461
Lee wasn't, I suppose.

27:11.363 --> 27:16.568
In my mind, I just always thought
that love was fireworks.

27:17.702 --> 27:22.707
I just didn't trust that steady burn
your father offered me.

27:25.243 --> 27:27.912
So, you pushed him,

27:28.847 --> 27:33.018
and you tested him
until he just couldn't take it anymore.

27:33.084 --> 27:34.352
Right?

27:36.588 --> 27:37.589
Yes.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.226
Jesus, that's what I have done
with every man I have ever been with.

27:43.061 --> 27:45.230
Pauletta, I'm so sorry.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.466
- Kara. Guess what?
- What?

27:48.533 --> 27:50.902
You were right. None of it is my fault.

27:50.969 --> 27:52.337
What's not your fault?

27:52.404 --> 27:54.572
Me driving my mother
to cheat on my father.

27:54.639 --> 27:56.041
Are you still harping on that?

27:56.107 --> 27:59.677
No, listen, everything I've learned
yesterday showed me that my parents,

27:59.744 --> 28:02.580
who I previously thought
were immune to relationship woes,

28:02.647 --> 28:04.115
are victims, too.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.618
See, crazy runs in the Patterson DNA.

28:07.419 --> 28:10.922
Honey, I'm so sorry. I know this divorce
has brought up a lot of stuff for you.

28:10.989 --> 28:14.125
No, don't be sorry,
because I've had a revelation.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.628
We have been looking
for an interview topic

28:16.694 --> 28:19.030
- in all the wrong places.
- We have?

28:19.097 --> 28:22.567
Yes. See, originally, I wanted
to do a piece about black women,

28:22.634 --> 28:25.637
more specifically, I wanted to talk
about how black women

28:25.703 --> 28:28.473
hold the key to everything
that ails us right now.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.909
- Okay.
- We bear the burden of America.

28:30.975 --> 28:33.711
Now that America is crumbling,
we can provide the pathway out

28:33.778 --> 28:35.713
because we have been there.

28:37.749 --> 28:40.785
Right? We know all about
the decline in marriage rates.

28:40.852 --> 28:42.987
We know about the increase
in drug addiction.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.557
We know all about limited access
to reproductive care

28:45.623 --> 28:48.860
because we have been dealing
with this shit for decades!

28:48.927 --> 28:50.128
True, but...

28:50.995 --> 28:54.132
I don't think Garrett'll sign off on it
because it's not global enough.

28:54.199 --> 28:55.900
Here's where Garrett would be wrong.

28:55.967 --> 28:59.237
Now white women,
they're facing the lash, too.

28:59.304 --> 29:02.273
See, they think that Trump is the answer.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.042
But we are.

29:04.943 --> 29:06.811
That is my angle.

29:09.614 --> 29:10.849
Okay.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.518
Maybe we can get it through

29:13.585 --> 29:15.854
if we get some kick-ass black women
to speak on it.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.888
- Hell, yes!
- Right?

29:17.422 --> 29:18.389
Girl.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.558
Forgive me for being bold,

29:20.625 --> 29:23.161
but what about Beyoncé?

29:23.228 --> 29:25.797
Or... Michelle Obama?

29:25.864 --> 29:27.499
- Nothing is off the table.
- Right?

29:27.565 --> 29:29.901
- Just shoot for the sky.
- Yes! Absolutely.

29:35.206 --> 29:39.410
- Our daughter insisted that we talk.
- Then I guess you'd better come in.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.050
Helen, I owe you an apology
for making you so upset

29:46.117 --> 29:48.353
you couldn't do the segment.
That was wrong.

29:50.155 --> 29:51.189
Paul, I...

29:52.257 --> 29:54.792
I know I have hurt you deeply.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.729
And it isn't the first time.

29:58.663 --> 30:02.534
The first ten years of our marriage
I spent pushing you away,

30:02.600 --> 30:05.069
just to see
if you would keep coming back.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.705
For that, I'm sorry.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.709
Well...

30:11.776 --> 30:13.244
What makes that so funny?

30:14.512 --> 30:16.948
I never expected you
to own up to any of this.

30:18.816 --> 30:21.486
I guess I'm surprised.

30:24.589 --> 30:27.725
I guess I never realized
the damage I did until...

30:28.760 --> 30:30.795
I saw how it affected Pauletta.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.799
You know, I always thought
the kids were protected

30:34.866 --> 30:37.635
as long as I was never with Frank.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.239
But I was still in love with him.

30:42.273 --> 30:45.543
Testing you, despite my feelings.

30:47.879 --> 30:48.880
Paul...

30:51.149 --> 30:54.419
We aren't the cause
of our problems, I am.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.390
You've been in love
with Frank all these years?

30:59.457 --> 31:01.192
No, I wasn't.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.496
When I decided to stay,

31:05.563 --> 31:08.166
and we had Paul Jr

31:09.133 --> 31:13.037
I made that decision
because I was deeply in love with you.

31:13.104 --> 31:15.106
I hope you understand that.

31:17.842 --> 31:19.043
I do.

31:20.078 --> 31:21.913
And I accept your apology.

31:23.748 --> 31:25.250
Better late than never.

31:25.316 --> 31:29.821
Hearing what you said
on the show moved me deeply.

31:31.522 --> 31:34.392
Paul, I want the damage to stop here.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.163
I'm not going to be with Frank.

31:42.267 --> 31:44.002
Thank you for sharing, Helen.

31:45.436 --> 31:47.505
But that doesn't change anything for me.

31:48.539 --> 31:49.941
I still want the divorce.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.348
Yeah.

31:58.883 --> 32:00.285
Can I call you right back?

32:01.386 --> 32:02.353
Thanks.

32:03.288 --> 32:04.322
Kara!

32:04.389 --> 32:07.725
Just the bitch I've been wanting to see.
Have a seat.

32:08.526 --> 32:10.261
<i>Dios mío. What'd I do now?</i>

32:10.328 --> 32:14.165
Aaliyah, she says that there's rumors
just flying all around

32:14.232 --> 32:15.967
that Garrett is considering

32:16.034 --> 32:18.936
EPing Orlando's new sports show.

32:20.571 --> 32:22.173
I don't know anything about that.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.442
No, no. Spill the tea, bitch.

32:24.509 --> 32:26.911
I didn't say anything
because if this works,

32:26.978 --> 32:30.348
and Garrett leaves GDU
I wanna be considered for his job.

32:30.948 --> 32:32.717
And I know Justin will, too.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.086
I appreciate you
looking out for our friendship.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.722
Well, after everything
we've been through, we have to.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.190
- Of course.
- Yeah.

32:39.257 --> 32:43.728
But the good news is I will have
no say in who replaces Garrett.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.864
So, let's just hope he's out,
and whatever happens after that...

32:47.598 --> 32:49.534
Is on you and Justin.

32:55.873 --> 32:58.242
Patrick. I thought it was room service.

32:58.309 --> 33:01.813
When you were a no-show at the meeting,
I thought on checking on you. You good?

33:01.879 --> 33:02.914
Yeah.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.682
Your mother called about an hour ago.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.651
She's not coming
to New Orleans with me.

33:08.219 --> 33:09.887
I didn't know that was on the table.

33:09.954 --> 33:11.856
Yeah, well, not anymore.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.728
- Do you need to talk to your sponsor?
- No.

33:17.762 --> 33:20.698
The program works if you work it, right?

33:29.974 --> 33:31.309
I know that look.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.710
Silent judgment.

33:33.478 --> 33:36.247
No, no judgment here, Frank.
I just know where you're at.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.416
Been there more times
than I care to remember.

33:38.483 --> 33:40.318
You think you know where I'm at, boy?

33:42.553 --> 33:44.088
This is about me

33:44.922 --> 33:46.157
and your mother.

33:47.658 --> 33:49.127
Damn woman.

33:49.193 --> 33:50.995
What happened to not harboring grudges?

33:51.929 --> 33:53.231
This time it's different.

33:53.631 --> 33:54.599
How so?

33:55.266 --> 33:56.567
Before there was always

33:58.002 --> 33:59.270
a sliver of hope.

34:00.772 --> 34:01.973
But now

34:02.573 --> 34:06.544
I know I'm gonna die without ever knowing
what it's truly like to be with her.

34:08.379 --> 34:09.680
That's where I'm at.

34:11.749 --> 34:14.886
<i>- You hanging in, big bro?
- I'm just a half-brother now, Letta.</i>

34:14.952 --> 34:17.822
Are you serious? You have been
my big brother for 40 years,

34:17.889 --> 34:21.058
<i>and if you think Frank coming to town
is gonna change that, you're crazy.</i>

34:21.125 --> 34:24.162
- How are you handling everything?
- I don't know.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.664
- It changes by the hour.
- Is there anything I can do?

34:26.731 --> 34:28.666
Well, I was gonna loop PJ in.

34:29.567 --> 34:33.037
- Our little brother is going to freak.
- Yeah.

34:33.504 --> 34:36.507
- I don't think I wanna be the messenger.
- I'll talk to him.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.242
How's Mom and...

34:39.210 --> 34:40.344
Dad?

34:41.212 --> 34:42.914
What was it like having them in New York?

34:43.748 --> 34:46.417
Not gonna lie.
There were some bumps in the road.

34:46.484 --> 34:51.122
I refereed a good old Patterson
smack down right before the segment,

34:51.189 --> 34:53.558
<i>and had to have Dad
do the show by himself.</i>

34:53.624 --> 34:54.725
Yeah, I saw that.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.594
That was a good call.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.263
You don't wanna change
Mom's mind about being with Frank?

34:59.330 --> 35:01.532
You know? I'm not sure.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.568
<i>Let me tell you what I am sure of.</i>

35:03.634 --> 35:05.002
Our troubles,

35:05.069 --> 35:09.040
my need to create drama
in every relationship,

35:09.106 --> 35:13.144
and your substance abuse,
they're rooted in our family dynamic.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.112
There's some truth to that.

35:15.179 --> 35:16.647
We're not our parents, Patrick.

35:16.714 --> 35:19.116
<i>All our drama, our baggage.</i>

35:19.584 --> 35:23.054
We can say
it ends right here, right now.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.356
You're saying I have control
over my situation?

35:25.423 --> 35:29.026
Well, aren't you the one who always says
"awareness is just the first step"?

35:29.093 --> 35:30.294
Yeah, I do.

35:31.229 --> 35:34.465
And now comes the hard part,
putting that awareness into action.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.534
Yeah.

35:45.276 --> 35:48.246
Somebody's in a good mood.
What the heck is that about?

35:48.779 --> 35:51.749
It looks like
the show is really happening.

35:52.650 --> 35:53.784
But not with Garrett.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.054
- What?
- Well, there's still a lot to celebrate.

35:57.121 --> 35:59.624
When CTS heard rumors
that Garrett might be leaving,

35:59.690 --> 36:01.192
they offered to promote him.

36:01.659 --> 36:02.727
You're kidding?

36:03.361 --> 36:05.963
He's gonna make it official
in a few weeks, but yeah.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.064
My gosh.

36:07.131 --> 36:11.035
And when Garrett announces,
I'm gonna go after his job big time.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.404
- I love it.
- There's no way you're not gonna get it.

36:13.471 --> 36:17.875
You know? I've been working my ass off
trying to get a great guest for MJ.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.911
- If the stars align...
- Who are you gonna get?

36:22.413 --> 36:23.814
I don't wanna jinx it.

36:24.282 --> 36:26.984
Let's just say, though,
that this'll be the biggest "get"

36:27.051 --> 36:28.019
of my career.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.655
Girl, you are such a mover and shaker.

36:31.088 --> 36:32.790
This is yours. I can feel it.

36:33.891 --> 36:34.959
Yep. Yep.

36:37.461 --> 36:39.564
No more of this green mush. No.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.500
We're gonna have some good food
to celebrate with.

36:42.567 --> 36:44.101
Baby, what about my diet?

36:44.168 --> 36:46.003
Yeah, your diet.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.874
Screw your diet

36:51.042 --> 36:52.310
for one night.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.343
<i>Orlando...</i>

37:27.111 --> 37:28.379
All set.

37:28.446 --> 37:30.481
I'll be out of your hair
in the morning, Letta.

37:32.950 --> 37:35.720
Mom, what are you gonna do?
Just gonna go to another hotel?

37:37.221 --> 37:40.625
I am going to have some alone time.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.293
And it's not a bad thing.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.161
I haven't had it in years.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.732
Pauletta. Come.

37:52.903 --> 37:54.438
Your independence,

37:55.139 --> 37:56.507
well, it's a blessing.

37:57.842 --> 37:58.909
I mean,

37:58.976 --> 38:02.613
I know
I've been overly critical at times.

38:02.680 --> 38:07.818
But, secretly, I admire the way
you just navigate your life

38:07.885 --> 38:10.354
through the bumps and all.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.027
I wish I could've lived
my life like that.

38:17.762 --> 38:20.598
It's funny because I always
wanted your life.

38:22.199 --> 38:27.238
The amazing, supportive good husband,
the house, the kids.

38:28.072 --> 38:31.475
But you have a chance to make all of that

38:32.677 --> 38:35.379
and with a man you're passionate about.

38:35.446 --> 38:38.949
But maybe it doesn't work
when there's that kind of passion.

38:39.016 --> 38:41.285
Well, you're never gonna know
if you don't try.

38:42.053 --> 38:45.122
Let me live vicariously through you.

38:45.189 --> 38:46.657
Mom, what are you saying?

38:46.724 --> 38:50.261
I'm saying, go get your man!

38:53.397 --> 38:54.765
My baby.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.642
- Girl, I did it!
- You did what?

39:04.709 --> 39:07.845
I did it! I milked every connection
I've ever made.

39:07.912 --> 39:10.948
I did everything but get on my knees
and beg and plead.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.250
I even tapped that Old Girls' Network.

39:13.317 --> 39:16.087
- What did you do, exactly?
- Okay, focus. Listen to me.

39:16.153 --> 39:19.890
I just booked our dream guest
for the prime-time show.

39:19.957 --> 39:22.226
- Holy shit, you got Beyoncé!
- Better!

39:22.860 --> 39:24.128
Beautiful Mary Jane Paul,

39:24.195 --> 39:26.964
you will now be interviewing
the former First Lady,

39:27.031 --> 39:29.066
Michelle Obama.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.002
Did you just say Michelle Obama?

39:32.069 --> 39:33.738
Yes, I did. I did. Yes, I did.

39:33.804 --> 39:36.507
Only the baddest,
most beautiful black woman on the planet!

39:36.574 --> 39:38.976
- That Michelle Obama?
- Yes, that Michelle Obama!

39:39.043 --> 39:40.444
- I'm about to be...
- Yes!

39:40.511 --> 39:43.714
- The Black Diane Sawyer!
- Yes, the beautiful Black Diane Sawyer!

39:43.781 --> 39:44.982
Can you believe it?

39:45.049 --> 39:46.917
- It's crazy!
- It's time to go!
