Jake, why didn't you
stick to the plan?

00:43.752 --> 00:44.674
Pssh.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.505
Hey, you want to
bump baby lumps?

00:46.588 --> 00:48.135
Sick. No.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.058
Just try to follow
the plans, okay?

00:50.133 --> 00:50.929
Yeah.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.556
Bleeaghhh!

00:52.636 --> 00:53.808
Come on out, cuties.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.480
It's safe now.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.523
Now get out of here!

01:00.602 --> 01:01.602
Hee hee hee hee.

01:02.646 --> 01:03.568
Hey.

01:03.647 --> 01:04.899
You hear something?

01:04.982 --> 01:08.361
Up there!

01:08.443 --> 01:10.195
It's a fat, fat warrior beat.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.873
It's all kshh! Kshh! Kshh!

01:12.948 --> 01:14.700
It calls me forth. Kshh!

01:14.783 --> 01:17.536
Man, it's probably
just puberty calling.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.338
Fighters.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.338
Fighters!

01:27.421 --> 01:32.097
Seek you glory from
the Fight King?

01:32.175 --> 01:33.722
Mmmaybe.

01:33.802 --> 01:41.802
Then step forth beyond the
moonlight seal to ba-a-a-a-the

01:42.811 --> 01:48.068
in blood and glory forever!

01:48.150 --> 01:49.527
Nah.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.532
This is a trap.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.658
K-pshh!

01:51.737 --> 01:53.489
We sniffed out that
trap like champs...

01:53.572 --> 01:55.825
Tryin' to get us up
in that cursed arena.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.286
Then I bet the exits would all
magically seal behind us.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.168
We'd probably have to
fight gladiator ghosts.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.169
Yeah!

02:03.248 --> 02:04.875
That sounds... so dumb.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.678
And flippin' awesome!

02:09.755 --> 02:11.632
We're back!

02:11.715 --> 02:13.388
Fools!

02:13.467 --> 02:17.563
All exits are sealed!

02:17.638 --> 02:23.896
Now you must fight my
gl-l-adiator gho-o-sts!

02:23.977 --> 02:25.979
Yeah. Okay!

02:40.410 --> 02:42.378
I'm-a beat you with
your own thing!

02:42.454 --> 02:43.501
Give it up!

02:43.580 --> 02:45.298
Ha-ha! Ohh!

02:45.374 --> 02:49.720
Hyperion, I'm sorry.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.513
Hyperion!

02:51.588 --> 02:56.310
My love.

02:56.385 --> 03:01.482
I'll kill you for
breaking your promise!

03:01.556 --> 03:03.684
Aah!

03:03.767 --> 03:05.644
Ugh! Yeah!

03:05.727 --> 03:07.604
Good!

03:07.688 --> 03:11.158
Take these branches of palm!

03:11.233 --> 03:12.280
Yeah!

03:12.359 --> 03:13.702
That prize kind of stinks.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.871
Let's go, Finn. My thighs hurt.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.198
Aw, man.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.532
Okay, it was fun.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.037
I'm keepin' the branch.

03:20.117 --> 03:24.213
Where do you think
you're going?!

03:27.040 --> 03:33.138
You must earn thy freedom by
defeating each of my ghosts.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.389
When you are ready, speak
the Fight King's name,

03:37.467 --> 03:44.100
and I shall raise
you for battle.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.604
Whoa!

03:45.684 --> 03:47.357
Ooh!

03:47.436 --> 03:48.779
Hmm.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.731
Okay. I have a plan.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.042
We'll do what the Fight King
says and defeat his ghosts to

03:53.066 --> 03:54.409
earn our freedom.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.578
You're gonna follow
my plan, right?

03:56.653 --> 03:57.653
Mm-hmm.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.449
But, hey, if you replace
me with a dummy,

04:00.532 --> 04:03.411
I could stay down here
and dig for lava!

04:03.493 --> 04:05.336
Then I'd forge a
molten hula-hoop!

04:05.412 --> 04:08.586
That's an entirely different
plan than my plan.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.008
What's the hula-hoop for?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.209
Morale, dude!

04:11.293 --> 04:12.840

04:29.561 --> 04:30.983
Badabada!

04:31.062 --> 04:34.316
It's a dirt dummy Jake...
Just like in the plan!

04:41.281 --> 04:44.034
We're ready, I
guess, Fight King.

04:47.412 --> 04:51.542
Gladitoria continues
for you, human.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.754
And, uh, uh... dog?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.759
Yep. This is dog.

04:57.881 --> 05:02.011
Arise, Priscus, Verus!

05:06.181 --> 05:08.024
Raaawrr!

05:08.099 --> 05:10.067
Yaahh!

05:11.770 --> 05:15.525
Forgive me, Priscus.

05:15.607 --> 05:20.408
Pity. The dog falls.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.954
Et tu, Verus?

05:28.078 --> 05:30.456
The combat endeth.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.840
Now come closer, champion.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.238

goin' on up there.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.437
It's me, Jake... Being
here the whole time.

05:47.472 --> 05:51.898
Come closer, my champion.

05:51.977 --> 05:57.950
You have proven
worthy of my favor.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.699
Word.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.405
Uh... this is bad.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.742
Accept your prize.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.245

06:18.378 --> 06:20.005
Yeah, I lives.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.305
Finn, come with me, man.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.381
Raah!

06:22.424 --> 06:24.347
Whoa! Dude.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.723
Sorry, man.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.179
But you crossed my kill zone.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.731
Fighters, rest now.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.025
Hwa! Hwa! Hwa! Hwa!

06:33.101 --> 06:34.023
So...

06:34.102 --> 06:35.729

the plan going?

06:35.812 --> 06:36.688
Yaah!

06:36.771 --> 06:38.273
Plan? What plan?

06:38.356 --> 06:39.278
To escape.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.200

you fight to win.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.292
Hmm.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.873
Finn is acting weird.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.050
Probably due to a
decrease in morale.
