a mythical legend.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.653
- You need to start training,
like, now.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.655
- I have to focus on staying
at this school.

00:54.721 --> 00:58.325
- Next audition will determine
who is in and who is out.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.727

from whatever is after her.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.330

01:05.098 --> 01:06.300
You might as well not be
dancing at all.

01:06.366 --> 01:07.434

01:07.501 --> 01:08.869
- Why wouldn't you use magic?

01:08.936 --> 01:10.070
- When you need to
be your best,

01:10.136 --> 01:11.638
let the others fall to rest.

01:11.705 --> 01:12.906
- What's happening?

01:12.973 --> 01:14.641
- The spell's making them
really sick.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.976
- We have an emergency.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.012
You will be dancing
on the main stage.

01:18.078 --> 01:22.015
I will make my selections based
on tomorrow's performance.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.631

to carb ratio for today.

I cut off the crusts.

- Nervous?

01:51.244 --> 01:54.115
I am. I even spritzed with
Calm Me Downtown.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.783
- Good call.
I love that blend.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.320
But I was gonna say beautiful.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.155
- I don't want to
embarrass myself.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.423
- Mm, no. Me either.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.159
I try to avoid that
at all costs.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.294
- You don't understand.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.095
I'm already at a disadvantage
because I have

02:09.162 --> 02:12.499
different training, but also,
I can't rehearse in the morning

02:12.566 --> 02:14.301

at the school.

02:20.607 --> 02:23.143
and you dance to
the best of your ability.

02:23.210 --> 02:26.080
And you commit to it being
better than yesterday.

02:26.147 --> 02:30.017
That is how you rise
to the top.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.985

- I know.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.154
You have to work harder.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.356
The rules in ballet
weren't written for us,

02:36.423 --> 02:38.726
so you have to work harder
than everyone else.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.127
You have to show them.

02:40.194 --> 02:44.298
You have to bring
everything to the table.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.466
- Yeah, I know.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.435
And if I could get
extra studio time...

02:48.502 --> 02:51.004
- You bring your Black
girl magic.

02:51.071 --> 02:54.241
Your extra sparkle.
- Yeah, okay.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.578

You hired me the other day.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.818
Huh.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.220
I guess I did.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.956
Well, you can start by
sweeping the shop.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.258
- Mm.
- And then

03:44.324 --> 03:46.360

04:03.476 --> 04:06.046
- You alone?
- For a minute. Yeah.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.115
- Don't be nervous.
Shake it off.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.084
You'll be fine.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.919
Look, I get it.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.755
I was trained by
mystic hunters.

04:14.821 --> 04:17.858
I worked in the field.
You only ever had books.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.260
But you need to trust me.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.329
I'm running this now.

reminding me.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.433
I just passed her,

04:26.499 --> 04:28.869
but there was no time
to search for the location.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.404
- [laughs]
Oh, boy.

04:31.471 --> 04:34.575
You're gonna need to
get out of your book talk.

04:34.642 --> 04:38.412
But sure, if you make a move
at the wrong time

04:38.479 --> 04:40.614
you'll start
an epic battle and

04:40.680 --> 04:43.150
if we lose,
we might never find her again.

04:43.217 --> 04:46.653
So we don't lose.
Got it?

04:46.720 --> 04:47.988
- But she's never alone.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.357
She's either at school
or with her aunt.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.893
And tonight, she has this
big performance.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.995
- That's perfect.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.764
No one will be able
to single you out.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.935
Blend in, drain her,
then get out of there. Got it?

I prefer to have a hard copy

of my schedule because
A, digital copies

05:52.653 --> 05:58.025
aren't reliable and B, makes me
feel better to hold it.

out there tonight,

stupid tarot cards.

Benoit lets the stress
get to him, that's for sure.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.493

07:16.804 --> 07:18.405

elevate or destroy each other.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.502
Ooh, Four of Cups.
- What does that even mean?

07:48.568 --> 07:50.871
- Rejection maybe.
- Rejection?

07:50.938 --> 07:53.039
As in rejection
from the school.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.377

gonna go rogue like that.
