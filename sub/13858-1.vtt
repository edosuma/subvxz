WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:04.004
(silence)

00:09.477 --> 00:11.779
(ominous music *)

01:17.445 --> 01:19.180
(knocking)

01:22.383 --> 01:23.351
- Yeah?

01:23.384 --> 01:24.818
- Hi.

01:24.852 --> 01:29.823
Um... Is this 216 Turnston
Drive, Apartment 6?

01:29.857 --> 01:31.559
Are you Janice,
with the daughter?

01:31.592 --> 01:34.362
- Seems to be.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.597
You Mr. Vanook?

01:36.630 --> 01:39.267
- That's the way they pronounced
it in the old country, but

01:39.300 --> 01:41.402
here it's Vanuk.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.337
Richard T. Vanuk.

01:43.371 --> 01:46.540
- You're Benson's guy.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.108
- Yep.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.679
- The witch doctor.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.381
- Yeah.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.522
(chuckling)

02:02.723 --> 02:05.293
- Are you drunk?

02:05.326 --> 02:07.628
- No. No.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.497
(growling)

02:15.236 --> 02:16.937
- She vomits constantly.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.273
She doesn't eat.

02:21.809 --> 02:25.246
She babbles nonsense,

02:25.279 --> 02:27.381
when it isn't
perverted bullshit,

02:27.415 --> 02:29.617
throughout the day and night.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.187
One night she screamed
for 20 minutes straight

02:33.221 --> 02:35.556
without taking a breath.

02:38.392 --> 02:42.496
Two days ago,
right after I called...

02:42.530 --> 02:43.664
Benson?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.833
- Yeah, that's his name.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.703
- She slapped herself
here on the table

02:49.737 --> 02:52.406
just like you see here.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.644
She doesn't move.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.382
She doesn't even listen.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.220
Doctors are damn useless.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.390
So, is this common?

03:09.423 --> 03:13.727
Is she like...
you know?

03:15.596 --> 03:17.865
- Yeah, she is.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.900
(snarling)

03:20.734 --> 03:22.736
- So, you can help her?

03:23.804 --> 03:25.373
- Yeah.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.442
- So what are you gonna do?

03:28.476 --> 03:32.480
- Work my witch
doctor magical powers.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.654
- So.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.263
How old are you?

03:49.297 --> 03:51.765
(growling and screeching)

03:52.533 --> 03:55.369
- Can you leave the room please?

03:55.403 --> 03:56.537
- Why?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.005
- It's technical.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.374
It doesn't concern you.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.377
- Why?

04:04.478 --> 04:05.946
- Please?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.420
Oh, God.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.300
Oh, God.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.470
God damnit!

05:23.957 --> 05:24.958
So...

05:27.094 --> 05:29.730
So, you like horses, huh?

05:30.798 --> 05:32.466
Horses.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.335
(growling)

05:36.837 --> 05:38.739
Yeah, I do, too.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.875
Different kinds.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.111
All different kinds.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.979
You know, I think it
stems back to the days of

05:46.013 --> 05:49.917
me watching really
cheesy 80s fantasy movies

05:49.950 --> 05:53.454
and reruns of
"Little House on the Prairie."

05:53.487 --> 05:55.423
Remember that show?

05:56.524 --> 05:58.392
You know, I could
never ride one.

05:58.426 --> 06:02.463
Because...I'm deathly
allergic to the hair,

06:02.496 --> 06:04.565
the dander on it.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.768
I mean, it's crazy.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.136
I just pet the
horse and instantly,

06:09.169 --> 06:12.105
my eyes, they just
come out of my sockets

06:12.139 --> 06:14.675
and I get hives
everywhere and I sweat

06:14.708 --> 06:16.109
and I breathe heavily.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.111
I had to have an
inhaler and shit.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.047
Even though I don't
have fucking asthma.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.417
There was this neighbor of
ours when I was growing up.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.620
He had this old codger
of a horse named Stretch.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.989
But, you know, an old
horse looks majestic.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.158
It kind of looks
like Robert Redford,

06:31.191 --> 06:33.627
the way he looks today,
only as a horse.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.806
It's gonna be a good one.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.943
Anyway, Stretch, the horse.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.211
Yeah.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.879
I remember when I was a kid,

07:25.913 --> 07:27.214
I was sitting in the
woods looking at him

07:27.247 --> 07:29.550
from a good distance
and I always thought,

07:29.583 --> 07:34.154
what would it be like to
go up to this horse and

07:34.187 --> 07:36.924
suck out all the shit
that was in my inhaler

07:36.957 --> 07:39.527
and get on top of
him and ride him.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.497
Just to feel like,
to be in control

07:43.531 --> 07:48.035
of a massive, powerful
animal like that.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.470
(panting and gasping)

07:56.143 --> 08:00.714
Not to be in control of some

08:00.748 --> 08:03.651
young, innocent
12-year-old girl.

08:05.085 --> 08:09.757
Only spineless, brainless,
dickless pussies do that shit.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.832
You fucking tightwad.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.552
Oh, God dammit.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.054
(growling)

08:41.088 --> 08:43.691
Look at this shit.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.893
Oh God, why the fuck does
it always taste like

08:45.926 --> 08:48.195
cream of fucking mushroom?

08:49.697 --> 08:52.232
(growling and snarling)

08:53.967 --> 08:55.703
God damnit!

08:56.937 --> 08:59.640
(suspenseful music *)

08:59.907 --> 09:00.908
Damnit!

09:04.077 --> 09:05.946
God damnit!

09:07.948 --> 09:09.683
(grunting)

09:45.653 --> 09:47.621
(gasping)

09:51.191 --> 09:53.126
(coughing)

10:10.844 --> 10:12.112
God.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.936
(panting)

10:52.452 --> 10:54.287
(coughing)

10:58.191 --> 11:01.194
(intense music *,
police siren)

11:16.043 --> 11:18.011
(glass clattering)

11:39.967 --> 11:41.434
(groaning)

11:45.372 --> 11:46.940
Oh, God.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.983
Fuck.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.819
(loud knocking)

13:17.197 --> 13:20.300
Oh, hey Burgess.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.035
- You're four days past due.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.404
Mama needs the rent.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.975
- Yeah, fine, I know.
All right.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.042
Well, you're in luck.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.411
I just got paid today but
I know it's not enough.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.281
I can give you half now and
half later if that's cool.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.448
- That's not cool.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.150
That's a fucking mind game.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.485
I know how you
drunk fuckers work.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.387
You been scamming
my mama forever.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.122
You pay half now and
you say you're gonna

13:42.155 --> 13:44.491
pay half later but
later never comes.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.593
And then, you say
you paid it all,

13:46.626 --> 13:48.461
but it's your word
against Mama's,

13:48.495 --> 13:50.297
but Mama ain't got
time or money for

13:50.330 --> 13:51.631
lawyers and courts and shit,

13:51.664 --> 13:54.067
so you see where I'm
coming from, dickwad?

13:54.101 --> 13:54.902
- All right.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.870
I mean, I appreciate
your situation.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.038
- You know what
happens to dickwads

13:58.071 --> 13:59.606
that don't pay
their rent on time?

13:59.639 --> 14:01.408
- I'm sure it's
anything but good, but--

14:01.441 --> 14:03.610
- You ever hear of Gobakev?

14:03.643 --> 14:04.611
- What?

14:04.644 --> 14:06.880
- Gobakev.

14:06.914 --> 14:10.117
Gobakev, that Russian
mongoloid with that red shit

14:10.150 --> 14:13.253
all over his forehead?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.621
- Gorbachev.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.489
- That's exactly what I
said, you fucking moron.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.590
Smart guy.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.392
You're so fucking smart,
why don't you take a shower?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.929
You're filthy.
You're disgusting.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.596
You stink. Look at this place.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.999
Boozing it up with a bunch
of blacks and Mexicans

14:26.033 --> 14:27.067
and Jews and shit.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.435
You know what?

14:28.468 --> 14:31.438
What's that little
contraption over there?

14:31.471 --> 14:33.006
- It's worthless, Burgess.

14:33.040 --> 14:33.974
It's a typewriter.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.475
It's obsolete.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.244
I have it because I can't afford

14:37.277 --> 14:38.979
a fucking computer, you know,

14:39.012 --> 14:40.347
but I need this
for my second job.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.950
- What's you do for work?

14:44.184 --> 14:45.518
- I write.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.454
- Well, that makes
you half a faggot.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.522
You can take those faggoty
skills and hit the streets

14:49.556 --> 14:51.624
and do some dick-sucking
over the next few days.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.526
I bet you'd be able to
collect a lot of money

14:53.560 --> 14:55.695
with those pretty little
dick-sucking lips you got.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.630
So, get your dick-sucking
skills in line and

14:57.664 --> 15:00.267
go suck some cock, okay?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.334
How's that sound?

15:01.368 --> 15:05.405
I'll be back on Friday for
all the rent, not half,

15:05.438 --> 15:06.606
and if you don't have all of it,

15:06.639 --> 15:08.541
I'm going to schedule
a summit meeting

15:08.575 --> 15:13.280
with you and Mr.
Gorbachev, all right?

15:13.313 --> 15:16.283
So go fuck yourself
and your mama.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.457
No matter.

15:24.491 --> 15:29.596
As long as he continues
to finance my
steel-based factories,

15:29.629 --> 15:32.632
we shall all be gods.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.068
Excuse me...

15:38.738 --> 15:45.212
Those damned Devoz's are going
to turn GR into a bigger
shit-hole than it already is.

15:50.083 --> 15:53.086
...are ready.
Commence combat.

15:55.488 --> 15:59.092
Deacon, that well...

15:59.126 --> 16:02.462
Deacon, will you please
reconsider on coming tonight?

16:02.495 --> 16:05.098
A god cannot be summoned!

16:30.690 --> 16:32.592
- What the fuck?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.131
Fucking ones.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.086
(telephone ringing)

17:10.630 --> 17:12.399
Hello, hi, hello.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.235
- [man on phone]
Hey there, big guy.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.769
Feeling all right?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.538
You did get home okay?

17:18.571 --> 17:19.572
- Yeah.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.541
Yeah.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.543
Who cleaned me up?

17:23.576 --> 17:26.446
- [man on phone]
Janice. The mother.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.748
She insisted.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.419
- Oh, yeah, her.

17:32.452 --> 17:36.556
Did she take off my clothes?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.159
Did she take advantage?

17:39.192 --> 17:42.262
- [laughs] You wish.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.597
I don't think she's
into vomit porn, man.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.466
You were a mess.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.568
She just did your laundry.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.571
I had to call up Mike,
have him come down,

17:51.604 --> 17:54.307
look in on you.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.709
- Yeah. Mike.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.712
The story of my
fucking life, man.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.686
No, you know something?

18:06.719 --> 18:08.755
Fuck, how long was I out?

18:08.788 --> 18:10.123
- Don't worry about it.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.158
Things are looking up.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.760
They're on their way,
I promise you that.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.828
- Jesus man, it better.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.530
Dude--
Seriously, man.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.433
75 fucking ones?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.335
Seriously?

18:22.369 --> 18:24.604
I mean, shit.
I mean...

18:24.637 --> 18:26.473
I have the landlord--
- No.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.475
- Dude, I'm gonna get
evicted and shit, man.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.909
I have bills to fucking pay.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.212
- That is not my
fucking responsibility.
- I can't live like this.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.282
Getting evicted from your
place ain't my problem.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.751
Why don't you ease
up on the sauce?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.754
- Sauce? Sauce?
The sauce.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.724
What are you, my Pa?

18:46.326 --> 18:48.661
Who calls it the sauce anymore?

18:48.695 --> 18:51.264
- Oh, fuck you.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.466
Well, you're in luck.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.403
I got another one
for you, right away.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.637
It's tomorrow.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.239
You sober for it?

18:59.272 --> 19:01.641
- Tomorrow already?
- [man on phone]
Yes, right away.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.609
- Seriously, dude.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.910
Jesus, Mary, fucking
Judas Priest and Joseph.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.313
- [man on phone] Just get a
pen, write down the address.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.614
- No.
- Yes.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.915
- Just get the--
- Can it wait, like--?

19:08.948 --> 19:11.484
- No, it cannot wait at all.
- ...wait.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.685
Get a pen.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.455
I know you've got one because
you write on my phone,

19:15.488 --> 19:17.257
on company property.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.426
[bottle clanks]
- I don't-- Wait, what?
- Start writing

19:19.459 --> 19:20.693
now because
I'm going to give you

19:20.727 --> 19:23.596
- the address--
- Write it down.
- Yes, write it down.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.431
- What's the address?

19:24.464 --> 19:28.501
- 555...
- Yeah, I know, okay.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.769
All right, hold on.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.271
- [sighs]
You know, you're going to

19:31.304 --> 19:32.805
give me a heart attack
one of these days.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.407
- Yeah, okay, bye.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.577
- No, I need to know whether
or not-- I didn't say--
- Yeah, love you, bye!

19:47.354 --> 19:48.755
[bottle clanks]

20:08.508 --> 20:10.677
(loud rustling)

20:11.611 --> 20:14.347
(suspenseful music *)

21:00.660 --> 21:02.662
(wind blowing)

21:10.002 --> 21:12.605
(loud knocking)

21:12.639 --> 21:13.773
Hello?

21:22.815 --> 21:24.551
Hello?

21:32.959 --> 21:36.796
Richard Vanuk, is this
the right address?

21:36.829 --> 21:38.631
Hello?

21:42.435 --> 21:43.436
Shit.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.874
(clicking)

21:59.786 --> 22:00.853
Hello?

22:07.126 --> 22:08.595
Shit.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.667
Hey, hey, are you okay?

22:20.873 --> 22:21.974
What's that?

22:23.876 --> 22:26.112
I'm not going to hurt you,
I'm just going to take that.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.581
Okay? I'm going to take that.

22:28.615 --> 22:31.884
No, please stop.
Don't do that, don't!

22:31.918 --> 22:34.521
Please! Please. Please.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.022
Please. Please.

22:36.055 --> 22:39.492
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

22:44.431 --> 22:49.436
You got--
You got folks around here?
Are they here?

22:51.638 --> 22:53.506
Where are they?

22:57.076 --> 22:59.879
Down there, that way? That way?

22:59.912 --> 23:00.913
Down.

23:02.615 --> 23:07.019
They're downstairs.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

23:07.053 --> 23:09.055
Okay, you don't like that.
I know, I'm sorry.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.790
I'm gonna be right back.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.158
Okay.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.528
Oh jeez.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.882
Okay, I'm just gonna
go downstairs.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.117
Okay? Stay here.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.891
Oh, shit.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.160
Oh, shit.

23:48.828 --> 23:52.431
Quit scaring me, okay?
Oh my God.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.071
Fuck.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.851
Oh, shit.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.157
Hello?

24:30.537 --> 24:32.071
Who's there?

24:34.541 --> 24:35.842
Hello?

25:03.102 --> 25:04.170
Hello?

25:17.316 --> 25:21.854
[thud]
Fuck me! Jesus Christ.

25:22.822 --> 25:26.192
Short people a hundred
fucking years ago.

25:29.328 --> 25:30.930
Hello?

25:40.072 --> 25:42.675
Fucking Ringo or something?

25:56.956 --> 26:01.060
Hello? Oh God.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.256
Hello?

26:57.750 --> 27:00.286
Oh fuck. What the fuck?

27:02.021 --> 27:04.290
Oh Jesus, God, fuck.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.170
I don't know--

27:21.007 --> 27:22.742
(gurgling)

27:22.775 --> 27:25.745
Okay, okay, okay!

27:25.778 --> 27:27.646
(coughing)

27:31.884 --> 27:34.386
You okay?
You all right there?

27:36.055 --> 27:37.790
You called me.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.160
- Oh my God!

27:42.795 --> 27:44.330
(loud crying)

27:45.064 --> 27:46.065
Slow down.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.205
You tried to kill me!

28:08.220 --> 28:10.322
You tore up our Bible!

28:14.426 --> 28:16.996
- Fifteen percent accurate
is not the greatest--

28:17.029 --> 28:18.865
- I know it wasn't right.

28:18.898 --> 28:25.071
He started that thing, started
burning his fingernails.

28:25.104 --> 28:29.809
And he kept biting
them and biting them.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.378
There was nothing left.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.221
Where's my daughter?
- [Richard] No, she's upstairs.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.490
Where's my daughter?
- [Richard] She's upstairs.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.193
She's safe and sound,
she's a little bloody.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.494
I don't know if it
was her blood or not,

28:48.527 --> 28:51.497
I don't know.
I just walked in here.

28:51.530 --> 28:54.133
You called me, right?

28:54.166 --> 28:57.937
- Yes.
- I'm here, I can try.
- You can't help him.

28:59.939 --> 29:04.176
You can't help him, no one can.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.312
I have to go to my daughter.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.816
I don't want anything
to do with him.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.321
- You'll be all right!

29:15.354 --> 29:17.489
(loud growling)

29:37.409 --> 29:38.878
Smile, Reverend.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.913
(moans)

30:07.907 --> 30:11.477
Man, keep your hands
to yourself, buddy.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.347
You know what, stop that.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.417
God damnit.

30:28.627 --> 30:31.230
Jesus, it's heavy.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.968
I've never seen one
this wet before.

30:38.905 --> 30:43.342
Jesus, no wonder why
this book is

30:43.375 --> 30:45.544
the New York Times
Bestseller forever.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.018
- Come in.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.319
- No.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.223
- Please. Come in.

30:57.256 --> 31:00.159
- No, I'm not that
kind of guy, man.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.593
- Come in.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.229
- All right, I'm
gettin' really fuckin'

31:03.262 --> 31:05.998
tired of this game, all right?

31:06.032 --> 31:07.599
All right so--

31:07.633 --> 31:09.135
(loud growling)

31:09.168 --> 31:11.303
Hey, whoa.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.644
- Come in.

31:18.677 --> 31:19.878
- Oh, man.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.581
Come in. Come in.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.550
Please, come in.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.019
Come in.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.622
Come in.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.424
(grunting and screaming)

32:25.611 --> 32:27.213
(coughing)

32:29.115 --> 32:31.450
(spits)
Oh, fuck.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.558
(suspenseful music *)

33:04.383 --> 33:05.517
Fuck.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.220
(bar room chatter)

33:08.254 --> 33:09.455
(rock music *)

33:09.488 --> 33:11.490
- Is this the only
shit that's on?

33:11.523 --> 33:13.392
Turn down Patsy Cline!

33:32.111 --> 33:36.082
- Hey, you give
head to strangers?

33:36.115 --> 33:37.049
- No.

33:37.083 --> 33:40.619
- Well then, allow me
to introduce myself.

33:40.652 --> 33:44.523
- Hey, the name's Steve.
It's Steve.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.158
Because I'm gonna be
down there for so long

33:46.192 --> 33:49.761
you're gonna forget what
the fuck my name was.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.230
(men jeering)

33:51.263 --> 33:54.166
- You know I'm sick
of watching these
guys bother you all night long.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.136
If I could one thing and just
one weekend with you,

33:57.169 --> 33:58.637
your ass and a jar of Cheez Whiz

33:58.670 --> 34:00.639
would make me a very happy man.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.575
(men jeering and laughing)

34:11.750 --> 34:15.321
- How 'bout you, you got a
line for me, Eddie Munster?

34:17.189 --> 34:20.492
- Lurch, you TV illiterate.

34:20.526 --> 34:23.595
Yeah, I got a line.

34:27.433 --> 34:31.203
Here's to swimming
with bowlegged women.

34:32.171 --> 34:33.305
- What?

34:33.339 --> 34:36.675
- That's from Jaws I,
you fuckin' moron.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.677
(men jeering)

34:38.710 --> 34:41.480
- Best shot I ever heard.

34:41.513 --> 34:42.714
- Nice.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.751
- Come on, god damnit.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.853
- Hey, Burgess!

34:47.886 --> 34:49.688
You come to this shit-hole,
too?

34:49.721 --> 34:51.357
- Fuck you!

35:09.575 --> 35:10.476
- [Male voice]
You know dogs have

35:10.509 --> 35:13.479
unconditional love
but people don't.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.615
Even after all the
evil things he did

35:16.648 --> 35:20.352
and how horrible he was
to everyone around him,

35:20.386 --> 35:24.590
that there was still
somebody who loved him.

35:24.623 --> 35:31.197
And that tells me
that he was also

35:31.230 --> 35:33.499
capable of loving.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.701
- [Female voice]
It's not the same.

35:35.734 --> 35:40.939
- [Male voice]
It's the same.
It's exactly the same company.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.674
Because it doesn't
matter how crazy

35:42.708 --> 35:46.345
or how difficult or
evil somebody is.

35:46.378 --> 35:49.181
They deserve to be loved.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.388
You care for it.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.798
(typewriter clacking]

36:08.234 --> 36:12.238
(loud tapping)

36:28.720 --> 36:30.656
(typewriter clacking)

36:34.993 --> 36:35.961
(glass breaks)

36:35.994 --> 36:37.329
Hello!

36:37.363 --> 36:39.365
(phone ringing)
Oh.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.375
Shit.

36:52.778 --> 36:55.347
(dark, dramatic music *)

37:14.366 --> 37:16.768
(loud knocking)

37:20.739 --> 37:23.975
- Are you the one
who brings the taffy?

37:24.009 --> 37:25.377
- Yeah.

37:26.378 --> 37:29.615
- You're gonna help my boy.
Come on in.

37:32.351 --> 37:35.020
I made all his favorite food but

37:35.053 --> 37:38.390
his jaw just keeps going
and he won't eat anything.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.900
Can you help him?

38:00.546 --> 38:05.050
I made all his favorite food,
he won't eat anything.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.423
- Jesus.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.593
- As you can see,
he hasn't ate today.

38:14.626 --> 38:18.397
We've tried
feeding him but...

38:18.430 --> 38:19.931
Pretty effortless.

38:21.099 --> 38:26.638
- Well what's the deal with
those restraints there?

38:26.672 --> 38:28.474
- He can get violent.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.811
- Well what's the deal
with that apparatus

38:32.844 --> 38:35.113
on his face, what does that do?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.882
- Here, I'll show you.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.052
(loud chomping)

38:52.764 --> 38:55.801
Then when we try to feed him.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.619
So, what do you think?

39:13.652 --> 39:15.521
What can you do about this?

39:15.554 --> 39:17.456
- Well right now I'm gonna ask

39:17.489 --> 39:19.090
you if you can leave the room.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.859
- Sir, I'm a healthcare
professional.

39:20.892 --> 39:25.864
I'm responsible for him,
I'm not leaving his side.

39:25.897 --> 39:31.437
- Look, it's technical.
Doesn't concern you.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.551
- Fine.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.408
(loud chomping)

40:31.229 --> 40:33.665
- What a delightful spread.

40:36.802 --> 40:40.472
Could you please stop that?
It's kind of annoying.

40:43.709 --> 40:44.710
Thank you.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.681
Are you gonna eat this?

40:56.988 --> 40:58.990
Vienna sausage.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.032
It's like a gatling gun.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.502
I'm sorry.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.208
Oh, that's good.

41:39.698 --> 41:43.134
Oh, man. Mashed potatoes.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.239
I remember as a kid when my mom

41:48.273 --> 41:50.842
used to make this
for me and my brother

41:50.876 --> 41:53.645
and used to sit there
at dinnertime and,

41:53.679 --> 41:55.947
did you ever see
Close Encounters?

41:55.981 --> 41:58.850
Well anyway, Richard Dreyfuss
starts making

41:58.884 --> 42:01.853
the mountain out of
mashed potatoes and

42:01.887 --> 42:03.755
I don't know, we always
thought that was neat.

42:03.789 --> 42:05.957
We've probably been doing
it for close to 25 years.

42:05.991 --> 42:07.859
Even going to restaurants,
we still do it.

42:07.893 --> 42:09.127
It becomes just a habit.

42:09.160 --> 42:13.632
Just a routine,
kind of like this job.

42:13.665 --> 42:15.300
I come in here,
I say some dumb shit

42:15.333 --> 42:18.303
that you can't
even comprehend

42:18.336 --> 42:20.706
and then I do my job.

42:22.674 --> 42:24.643
I guess that's what
happens when you turn pro.

42:24.676 --> 42:26.578
Just don't think anymore,
just under hypnosis.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.313
It's like the drive
to work and back.

42:28.346 --> 42:32.183
If you work at the same job
for 20 years, forget the drive.

42:32.217 --> 42:34.352
You're like, "Holy shit,
I'm here."

42:34.385 --> 42:37.923
Which is weird because I was
never the best at anything.

42:37.956 --> 42:39.190
Sports.

42:40.926 --> 42:43.995
Schooling, books,
you know, homework, no.

42:44.029 --> 42:46.932
Tests? Oh shit.
Never went to college.

42:46.965 --> 42:50.268
Just barely passed high school.

42:50.301 --> 42:56.942
But then you find
what you want in life

42:56.975 --> 43:01.079
and I don't know if you
find it or it finds you,

43:01.112 --> 43:06.017
but, you know, I found
something I'm good at.

43:08.787 --> 43:09.955
See?

43:13.892 --> 43:15.827
Did it again, didn't even know.

43:29.107 --> 43:32.177
- Richie. Richie!

43:33.244 --> 43:37.015
Do you understand how
much agony I'm in?

43:39.150 --> 43:40.618
So much pain.

43:41.452 --> 43:45.290
Everywhere around
people are salivating.

43:46.391 --> 43:48.359
They're raping me.

43:49.895 --> 43:53.765
I can't help this
feeling in hell.

43:54.733 --> 43:58.904
I want your hand,
just pull me up.

43:58.937 --> 44:01.239
I'm being crushed.

44:02.207 --> 44:06.211
They're forcing me
to do so many things.

44:06.244 --> 44:10.415
I just, I just,
I want to be free.

44:20.859 --> 44:23.661
- I didn't like
that bitch anyway.

44:32.337 --> 44:34.773
(loud growling)

45:00.365 --> 45:01.867
- Beans.

45:04.169 --> 45:06.838
Want any of these?

45:09.975 --> 45:12.811
- No, I'm okay,
thank you very much.

45:19.150 --> 45:22.120
- Actually, pass the peas.

45:22.153 --> 45:24.222
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.500
(loud chewing)

45:54.019 --> 45:55.887
- What is that,
mayonnaise or something?

45:55.921 --> 45:58.957
With all the peeps
swimming in it?

46:00.425 --> 46:02.460
- It's tapioca.

46:20.979 --> 46:22.547
- Oh, I'm--
(burps)

46:22.580 --> 46:26.351
- Oh, I'm sorry, man,
I mouthed it.

46:26.384 --> 46:29.888
You don't have cups
or anything, do ya?

46:56.281 --> 46:58.449
(loud burping)

46:58.483 --> 47:00.085
Gross.

47:20.005 --> 47:22.373
(loud growling)

47:39.357 --> 47:41.592
Eat shit and die.

47:45.663 --> 47:47.565
Unbelievable.

48:00.045 --> 48:01.046
Bastard!

48:17.528 --> 48:19.430
Drown in it, you fuck!

48:26.237 --> 48:27.638
Shit!

48:35.713 --> 48:38.316
Suck...bitch!

48:42.487 --> 48:45.490
Fuck off!
Fuck!

48:46.257 --> 48:48.393
(loud growling)

49:43.214 --> 49:44.515
Burgess.

49:46.784 --> 49:47.985
Bur--

49:52.623 --> 49:55.460
Knife throwing
Richard Vanuk comes

49:55.493 --> 49:58.629
with everything you see here.

49:58.663 --> 50:01.132
Vehicle sold separately.

50:14.379 --> 50:16.747
Fuckin' a, Morgan Freeman.

50:16.781 --> 50:19.350
(phone ringing)

50:28.159 --> 50:30.027
What's up, Chief?

50:30.661 --> 50:32.097
Cool.

50:35.500 --> 50:38.503
6655...

50:44.175 --> 50:45.476
Tonight?

50:49.380 --> 50:52.117
Yeah? Fuck, really?

50:53.618 --> 50:55.820
Yeah I still got it.

50:57.655 --> 50:58.723
Shit.

51:11.869 --> 51:14.071
(low growling)

51:51.176 --> 51:53.144
- Four days are up. Rent's due.

51:53.178 --> 51:57.615
And I scheduled a G-8 summit
with you and Gorbachev.

51:57.648 --> 51:59.016
See that shit?

51:59.049 --> 52:00.285
That's what happened to the last
motherfucker didn't
pay his rent.

52:00.318 --> 52:04.722
Now it's time for me to make an
example out of your dumb ass.

52:04.755 --> 52:06.324
- Look.

52:08.593 --> 52:09.894
Burgess.

52:12.330 --> 52:14.365
I know we do this
dance quite often--

52:14.399 --> 52:15.566
- What is this?

52:15.600 --> 52:16.601
- What?

52:16.634 --> 52:19.504
- What's that?

52:23.541 --> 52:26.244
- This is my first job.

52:33.684 --> 52:35.286
- Oh, shit.

52:37.388 --> 52:44.262
Jesus Christ, Father,
I am really sorry.

52:44.295 --> 52:45.663
I didn't know.

52:45.696 --> 52:47.598
- Yeah, I know Burgess.
- You gotta tell me this shit.

52:47.632 --> 52:48.799
- You gotta work with me, man.

52:48.833 --> 52:50.935
- I'm sorry, Burgess, it's
kind of hard to tell you when

52:50.968 --> 52:54.205
you obviously see how
I live and what I drink.

52:54.239 --> 52:59.344
And priests are people too, we
can all the stuff that you do.

53:02.447 --> 53:03.481
Surprise.

53:03.514 --> 53:07.285
- Yeah, surprise.
Cocksucking priest, but look.

53:07.318 --> 53:09.587
I ain't gonna whoop
your ass today.

53:09.620 --> 53:11.556
You got another day
to get this done, okay?

53:11.589 --> 53:14.959
Go do what you do and get
back tomorrow, all right?

53:14.992 --> 53:17.662
- Okay. Thank you.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.502
- Father Vanuk.

53:24.535 --> 53:25.836
- Hello.

53:25.870 --> 53:26.837
- Father Vanuk.

53:26.871 --> 53:28.005
- Yes, that's me.

53:28.038 --> 53:30.241
- Father Vanuk.

53:35.946 --> 53:38.283
Jeans, Father?

53:40.017 --> 53:45.456
- Yeah, it's casual Friday
today down at the rectory.

53:51.396 --> 53:52.963
Can I come in?

53:53.063 --> 53:56.667
(old jazzy music *)

53:56.701 --> 53:59.337
- Things started happening
a few weeks ago, Father.

53:59.370 --> 54:01.339
The last week strange things.

54:01.372 --> 54:02.373
- Strange things?

54:02.940 --> 54:04.742
- Strange things.

54:04.775 --> 54:07.312
Every night he stands
in a different corner

54:07.345 --> 54:09.013
and just stares for hours.

54:09.046 --> 54:10.615
I wonder what he's looking at.

54:10.648 --> 54:13.017
- So, what's wrong with that?

54:13.050 --> 54:15.553
- He's blind, Father.

54:15.586 --> 54:18.489
And he makes things move.

54:18.523 --> 54:20.925
- You mean, move?

54:21.826 --> 54:24.329
- Yes. With his mind.

54:24.362 --> 54:26.497
(loud growling)

54:32.337 --> 54:35.406
Why is the devil in my house?

54:39.944 --> 54:45.916
- I don't know, maybe you
pull your pecker too much.

54:47.752 --> 54:52.022
- Father, I don't do that.
That's a sin.

54:52.056 --> 54:53.691
- Right.

54:53.724 --> 54:55.660
Yeah, yeah, forgot about that.

54:55.693 --> 54:57.294
I'm sorry I mentioned--

54:59.597 --> 55:01.065
- What's that?

55:01.098 --> 55:02.166
- Holy water.

55:02.199 --> 55:05.903
- Anyhow I baked cookies
for the sister's bake sale.

55:05.936 --> 55:09.774
We give $21.35 each
week to the church.

55:09.807 --> 55:13.110
Pancakes and he ushers
an over-30 softball league

55:13.143 --> 55:16.681
and we help Girl Scouts sell
the Girl Scouts for the church.

55:16.714 --> 55:18.916
Girl Scout cookies for
the church last year.

55:18.949 --> 55:20.718
We do the stations of the cross,

55:20.751 --> 55:22.487
we've done the offering,
I've done readings

55:22.520 --> 55:25.022
on Sunday five times this year.

55:25.055 --> 55:27.692
Jeremiah? Six.

55:27.725 --> 55:29.860
- Can I ask you
to leave the room?

55:29.894 --> 55:32.997
- Father, no, I need
to help my brother.

55:33.030 --> 55:36.467
I need to help you.
Father, I need to help God.

55:36.501 --> 55:39.504
- It's technical,
it doesn't concern you.

55:39.537 --> 55:41.105
- I'm a
eucharistic minister.

55:41.138 --> 55:42.873
- Can you leave
the room, please?

55:42.907 --> 55:47.344
- I need to be here.
You don't understand.

55:48.145 --> 55:52.383
- All right, okay. Well...
You wanna help?

55:52.417 --> 55:53.484
- Yes, yes, Father.

55:53.518 --> 55:54.452
- Okay,
you wanna be my altar boy?

55:54.485 --> 55:55.853
- Yes, yes, Father.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.388
- Well I'm gonna need
a few things from you.

55:57.422 --> 55:58.423
- Okay, okay.

55:58.456 --> 56:01.826
- Okay, number one I'm gonna
need some candles.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.994
And I'm talking like
a fuck-ton of candles.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.996
- You mean a bunch of candles?

56:06.030 --> 56:07.932
- Yeah a bunch of candles,
I'm sorry, my son.

56:07.965 --> 56:11.135
I apologize, I'll go
to reconciliation
tomorrow for that.

56:11.168 --> 56:14.138
I'm sorry, I'm just talking
about a crap-ton, I need a lot.

56:14.171 --> 56:17.608
- A lot of candles, yes.
- I'm just gonna say crap-ton,
that's fine.

56:17.642 --> 56:19.143
Also, I'm gonna need a Bible.

56:19.176 --> 56:20.878
- Father, you don't carry
your own Bible?

56:20.911 --> 56:22.980
- I'm talking about
a household Bible, okay?

56:23.013 --> 56:25.916
So with the
love of the family,

56:25.950 --> 56:27.051
That one will do right there.

56:27.084 --> 56:29.487
I'm sure that is a Bible,
yeah, this will work fine.

56:29.520 --> 56:33.524
Also, I'm going to need two
bottles of your best wine.

56:34.692 --> 56:36.026
- Wine?

56:36.060 --> 56:38.028
- Yeah, it's a new tradition.

56:38.062 --> 56:39.630
What you do is you make
a circle of protection

56:39.664 --> 56:42.166
with the blood of Christ,
I have to bless it first.

56:42.199 --> 56:43.901
You just sprinkle it
around the ground,

56:43.934 --> 56:45.970
you make a circle,
you put yourself in it.

56:46.003 --> 56:49.039
Demons hate it,
it's a new tradition.

56:54.011 --> 56:55.680
- I don't...

56:57.882 --> 57:01.185
I just don't understand.

57:01.218 --> 57:04.421
I just don't get it.

57:11.028 --> 57:12.229
Jeans, Father?

57:12.262 --> 57:14.532
- Oh, Jesus, give
me a fucking break.

57:14.565 --> 57:16.200
Would you just get the fucking,
god damn wine

57:16.233 --> 57:21.739
and all the candles and all
that shit that I told you to?!

57:21.772 --> 57:23.774
Sorry, my son.

57:30.715 --> 57:32.483
(loud growling)

58:11.021 --> 58:12.890
(loud growling)

58:43.821 --> 58:46.691
- Here's the wine and
the candles, Father.

58:48.959 --> 58:50.360
(burps)

58:54.231 --> 58:56.233
(loud jazz music *)

59:21.358 --> 59:24.695
- (burps) Oh, shit.

1:00:02.733 --> 1:00:04.835
- What was that
wine for, Father?

1:00:04.869 --> 1:00:06.370
- Well that wine was
for me, that one there

1:00:06.403 --> 1:00:09.239
is for the circle of protection.

1:00:10.207 --> 1:00:12.276
- What about the
invocation of St. Michael?

1:00:12.309 --> 1:00:13.343
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:00:13.377 --> 1:00:16.213
All right fine, fine, you
wanna do the invocations

1:00:16.246 --> 1:00:19.750
and the explorations
and of his exfoliations

1:00:19.784 --> 1:00:21.218
and all this vacation
toxin bullshit?

1:00:21.251 --> 1:00:22.753
Come on, come on,
set that shit down, dude.

1:00:22.787 --> 1:00:25.122
Come on, up and at 'em,
look alive there, Sonny.

1:00:25.155 --> 1:00:28.759
You're a altar boy now, okay?

1:00:28.793 --> 1:00:31.361
Somewhere in the back here.

1:00:31.395 --> 1:00:34.264
Oh shit, I was on the page.

1:00:34.298 --> 1:00:36.266
Just breathe in, breathe out.

1:00:36.300 --> 1:00:38.635
Comfy. You ready?

1:00:40.905 --> 1:00:43.307
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.

1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:44.842
Amen.

1:00:47.311 --> 1:00:52.382
Holy Jesus Christ
our Lord and savior

1:00:52.416 --> 1:00:55.019
and the feast of all saints.

1:00:55.052 --> 1:00:57.354
What a life thou hast I mean.

1:00:57.387 --> 1:00:59.757
Thy Father is power.

1:01:03.761 --> 1:01:08.933
And with thy angels goes
though with light, life.

1:01:13.203 --> 1:01:16.273
But thou has Michael
somewhere in there

1:01:16.306 --> 1:01:19.209
amongst the thousands of guys.

1:01:19.243 --> 1:01:23.781
One, one Michael...

1:01:23.814 --> 1:01:26.316
which means
I shouldn't mention

1:01:26.350 --> 1:01:29.787
crosses and sea serpents
and dragons and

1:01:29.820 --> 1:01:32.757
slithery other
reptiles so Michael

1:01:32.790 --> 1:01:39.029
couldn't thou see thy way
of lending us thy crown

1:01:39.063 --> 1:01:42.199
and thy powers,
it is holy God...

1:01:42.232 --> 1:01:48.072
(electricity crackles)

1:01:48.105 --> 1:01:49.840
...with thetans.

1:01:51.842 --> 1:01:53.410
- The Bible!
- Shit!

1:01:56.513 --> 1:01:58.415
- That doesn't work!
- Father!

1:01:59.984 --> 1:02:02.252
I know what to do!
I know what to do!

1:02:06.891 --> 1:02:08.725
You're no priest!

1:02:12.462 --> 1:02:14.464
(music changes to ballad *)

1:02:24.909 --> 1:02:26.911
(growling)

1:02:41.291 --> 1:02:44.294
(no sound other than music)

1:03:26.603 --> 1:03:29.073
(loud taps)

1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:38.215
(coughing)

1:03:47.892 --> 1:03:49.826
- Good morning, friend.

1:03:53.230 --> 1:03:56.833
- Hey man, you clean up nice.

1:04:01.238 --> 1:04:02.973
Clean me up, too?

1:04:03.908 --> 1:04:05.642
- Couple of your
associates showed up,

1:04:05.675 --> 1:04:07.544
wanted to take you away.

1:04:08.545 --> 1:04:13.350
I wouldn't let them,
you needed the sleep.

1:04:16.186 --> 1:04:17.621
- Much obliged.

1:04:17.654 --> 1:04:20.357
Yeah, well...

1:04:20.390 --> 1:04:26.997
usually they'll dump
my ass off in a city park, or...

1:04:27.531 --> 1:04:29.266
- Have a seat.

1:04:31.501 --> 1:04:32.869
- Sure.

1:04:42.679 --> 1:04:47.517
- You know, I've been
blind since birth.

1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:53.623
And I've always felt
the sun on my face.

1:04:59.696 --> 1:05:03.000
But I've never seen a sunrise.

1:05:13.643 --> 1:05:15.445
Thank you.

1:05:18.048 --> 1:05:20.317
- No, you got the
wrong idea about me.

1:05:20.350 --> 1:05:21.351
I'm just...

1:05:25.322 --> 1:05:27.924
just a washed-up drunk asshole.

1:05:31.461 --> 1:05:34.598
- You know, when you walked in,

1:05:37.767 --> 1:05:43.007
that thing inside me,
it laughed.

1:05:44.541 --> 1:05:48.045
"I can handle a
priest's hypocrisy."

1:05:50.347 --> 1:05:57.021
But when you touched me,
it was confused.

1:05:57.787 --> 1:06:00.390
And you drove it out.

1:06:00.424 --> 1:06:05.229
And I knew right then that
you were not a priest.

1:06:07.797 --> 1:06:10.200
- I don't know what this is.

1:06:10.234 --> 1:06:13.337
I don't know what
this and all this is.

1:06:13.370 --> 1:06:15.372
I mean, you tell me.

1:06:15.405 --> 1:06:17.641
- You have a gift.

1:06:19.576 --> 1:06:21.645
You're a healer.

1:06:21.678 --> 1:06:24.114
You're a blessing
to other people.

1:06:24.148 --> 1:06:27.351
I don't know where
that gift comes from.

1:06:27.384 --> 1:06:31.021
A higher power within yourself.

1:06:31.055 --> 1:06:35.525
No one is given
that kind of a gift

1:06:35.559 --> 1:06:37.194
who is not meant to use it.

1:06:40.064 --> 1:06:43.500
Look, I know you have your
own demons, that's obvious.

1:06:43.533 --> 1:06:45.335
- (chuckles)
I know it is.

1:06:45.369 --> 1:06:48.605
Taking on other people's
demons must not be easy.

1:06:48.638 --> 1:06:52.142
When that darkness
was inside me,

1:06:55.545 --> 1:06:57.047
I remember everything.

1:07:01.385 --> 1:07:02.819
- I'm sorry.

1:07:02.852 --> 1:07:06.756
I didn't know that
that happened.

1:07:09.493 --> 1:07:11.728
- Did you ever ask?

1:07:20.204 --> 1:07:23.473
- Well, maybe I should
start asking him,

1:07:23.507 --> 1:07:26.210
see if he remembers anything.

1:07:30.314 --> 1:07:33.717
- I don't think he's
gonna remember a thing.

1:07:35.485 --> 1:07:37.687
- You're all right, man.

1:07:37.721 --> 1:07:40.424
What do they call you?

1:07:40.457 --> 1:07:42.226
- Jeremiah.

1:07:43.327 --> 1:07:44.761
- Jeremiah.

1:07:46.863 --> 1:07:49.666
It's a good biblical name,
isn't it?

1:07:49.699 --> 1:07:51.301
- Obviously.

1:07:51.335 --> 1:07:52.269
(laughing)

1:08:03.613 --> 1:08:05.449
Take care, Jeremiah.

1:08:06.916 --> 1:08:08.452
- You, too.

1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:13.790
Remember, you were
meant for this.

1:08:15.525 --> 1:08:18.128
- I'll keep that in mind.

1:08:19.696 --> 1:08:22.266
Oh, shit! Son of a bitch!

1:08:22.299 --> 1:08:25.202
I don't give a fuck what the
hell you fucking have to do.

1:08:25.235 --> 1:08:29.139
We have to create some sort
of a system, you know, a plan.

1:08:29.173 --> 1:08:32.509
None of this "buy one, get one
free" coupon code bullshit.

1:08:32.542 --> 1:08:34.344
If people would
just listen to me

1:08:34.378 --> 1:08:36.480
and just fucking leave
the room when I tell them to,

1:08:36.513 --> 1:08:38.348
none of this shit would happen.

1:08:38.382 --> 1:08:40.884
So there's no slowing down
in this god damn business,
okay?!

1:08:40.917 --> 1:08:42.552
You know what?
I'm the exorcist,

1:08:42.586 --> 1:08:45.489
I have all the
brainwave energy powers,

1:08:45.522 --> 1:08:47.624
all that shazaam bullshit
and you're the god damn

1:08:47.657 --> 1:08:52.496
fat-ass corporate America boss
that's micro-managing shit!

1:08:52.529 --> 1:08:54.298
You know what?
You get off your ass,

1:08:54.331 --> 1:08:55.632
you get with the program and you

1:08:55.665 --> 1:08:56.900
fucking do something about this.

1:08:56.933 --> 1:08:59.203
You get me that fucking money,
man!

1:08:59.236 --> 1:09:01.705
Look, I'm out of fucking
puke rags over here!

1:09:01.738 --> 1:09:05.375
You don't have a
fucking choice here!

1:09:07.677 --> 1:09:10.814
Fuck me?! Fuck you!

1:09:32.769 --> 1:09:36.172
Oh shit. God damnit!

1:09:42.712 --> 1:09:44.881
You're a good man.

1:09:45.615 --> 1:09:47.384
You help people.

1:09:48.518 --> 1:09:52.222
You help people and this
is where it gets you.

1:09:52.256 --> 1:09:53.957
It gives you these looks,
it gives you this

1:09:53.990 --> 1:09:56.426
and all this,
everything I see around me,

1:09:56.460 --> 1:09:59.195
this is my fucking palace.

1:09:59.996 --> 1:10:01.197
Yeah...

1:10:05.535 --> 1:10:07.437
I definitely earned this.

1:10:08.772 --> 1:10:10.907
You've earned this.

1:10:12.409 --> 1:10:15.345
Look at this after-jiggle.

1:10:20.617 --> 1:10:23.353
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1:10:23.387 --> 1:10:26.690
Mmn-Nn, no sir, it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

1:10:26.723 --> 1:10:28.892
There's no same
in this, no shame,

1:10:28.925 --> 1:10:32.329
there's no shame,
no shame in this.

1:10:32.362 --> 1:10:35.632
This is something
to be proud of.

1:10:37.066 --> 1:10:39.603
Because you're American.

1:10:40.570 --> 1:10:42.439
You've earned this.

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:46.443
You work for a living.

1:10:49.045 --> 1:10:53.650
You're in America.
There's also baseball.

1:10:58.922 --> 1:11:02.792
Richard Vanuk steps
up to the plate and--

1:11:02.826 --> 1:11:04.561
Jesus, fuck.

1:11:07.531 --> 1:11:09.433
But that's okay.

1:11:11.668 --> 1:11:14.604
Because now I got two bats.

1:11:15.739 --> 1:11:18.675
One for each of ya, Ty Cobb.

1:11:25.715 --> 1:11:28.352
Yeah, steps up to the plate.

1:11:31.555 --> 1:11:33.457
(loud knocking)

1:11:40.764 --> 1:11:42.466
Holy shit.

1:11:42.499 --> 1:11:44.634
- Richie.
- Kevin, Kelly--

1:11:44.668 --> 1:11:46.670
- Kenny.

1:11:46.703 --> 1:11:48.071
- Kenny!
- Kenny.

1:11:48.104 --> 1:11:51.541
- Yeah! How the fuck are ya?

1:11:51.575 --> 1:11:55.412
- Come in.
I'm sorry, I gotta tell you.

1:11:55.445 --> 1:11:57.080
I know it takes some
getting used to,

1:11:57.113 --> 1:11:59.683
but it smells like a
crackpot of chlamydia

1:11:59.716 --> 1:12:03.086
in a Burger King
bathroom in here.

1:12:07.023 --> 1:12:09.025
(soft rock plays
in background *)

1:12:13.530 --> 1:12:16.099
I don't know how you
always talk me into this.

1:12:16.132 --> 1:12:19.703
- Hey man, I was always the
prince of peer pressure.

1:12:19.736 --> 1:12:23.573
- Speaking of that,
little role reversal.

1:12:25.709 --> 1:12:28.912
I have a business opportunity.

1:12:33.617 --> 1:12:36.420
- Give that back.
Give that back.

1:12:37.421 --> 1:12:38.422
Give that--

1:12:47.196 --> 1:12:48.932
$12.75.

1:12:50.033 --> 1:12:51.535
- What are you talking about?

1:12:51.568 --> 1:12:53.036
- Well, you came over
in your free will,

1:12:53.069 --> 1:12:55.138
and if this is a business
opportunity not like,

1:12:55.171 --> 1:12:58.141
you don't care about me
or anything like that,

1:12:58.174 --> 1:13:01.411
it's like, that's $12.75.
I gotta treat this
like a bar, man.

1:13:01.445 --> 1:13:03.547
It's a business,
this shit's expensive--

1:13:03.580 --> 1:13:05.715
- Three honest Abes.

1:13:07.083 --> 1:13:10.119
I know you are living so
exquisitely right now, but--

1:13:10.153 --> 1:13:13.790
- You know what?
you could have been something
one day, man.

1:13:13.823 --> 1:13:15.659
You could have had all this.

1:13:15.692 --> 1:13:20.897
11-inch screen TV
with aluminum foil

1:13:20.930 --> 1:13:23.933
amplification on the antennae.

1:13:23.967 --> 1:13:26.636
I don't even need
to go through walls

1:13:26.670 --> 1:13:27.937
to get to my toilet, man.

1:13:27.971 --> 1:13:29.973
I'm a king of my own castle,

1:13:30.006 --> 1:13:33.643
I have pills that
is paid for by the--

1:13:33.677 --> 1:13:34.678
(clapping loudly)

1:13:36.580 --> 1:13:41.785
- I am offering you a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

1:13:41.818 --> 1:13:43.086
- For?

1:13:43.119 --> 1:13:44.153
- Marketing.

1:13:44.187 --> 1:13:47.924
We do pigmentation for
sporting goods equipment.

1:13:49.926 --> 1:13:51.461
- Are you serious?

1:13:51.495 --> 1:13:52.662
- That's not,
listen, that's not--

1:13:52.696 --> 1:13:54.998
- You guys don't make
the sports equipment

1:13:55.031 --> 1:13:56.800
or any of that shit,
you just supply

1:13:56.833 --> 1:13:58.768
the pigmentation for the color?

1:13:58.802 --> 1:14:00.604
- You don't have to
worry yourself with that.
You are--

1:14:00.637 --> 1:14:02.572
- It's a powder?
Wait, wait--

1:14:02.606 --> 1:14:04.107
- For sporting goods, yes.
- Color-coating?

1:14:04.140 --> 1:14:07.443
- You get a million
bucks for that?

1:14:11.515 --> 1:14:13.950
You remember Mother Teresa?

1:14:13.983 --> 1:14:14.818
Remember her?

1:14:14.851 --> 1:14:16.820
- Yeah, I keep up
on current events.

1:14:16.853 --> 1:14:18.187
I know who Mother Teresa is.

1:14:18.221 --> 1:14:23.960
- She was famous
but she died poor.

1:14:23.993 --> 1:14:27.030
She loved what she did.

1:14:27.063 --> 1:14:28.832
- What I need you
to do, what I think

1:14:28.865 --> 1:14:33.970
you're capable of doing, is
being a marketing director.

1:14:34.003 --> 1:14:35.572
Because you're a good writer.

1:14:35.605 --> 1:14:38.608
You write, I know
you write still.

1:14:39.776 --> 1:14:42.612
That's not there for show.

1:14:42.646 --> 1:14:44.247
And this isn't here for show.

1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:46.282
- When you go home
from work don't

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:48.585
you feel like you
wanted to make a change,

1:14:48.618 --> 1:14:52.055
like, where you can go to
sleep at nights going,

1:14:52.088 --> 1:14:55.158
"I did something for the world."

1:14:58.294 --> 1:15:02.131
You just supply a color
for padding in--

1:15:02.165 --> 1:15:04.267
(loud clapping)

1:15:04.300 --> 1:15:06.035
- Wake up!

1:15:06.069 --> 1:15:08.638
I'm trying to help you.

1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:12.642
- Drink it.

1:15:13.643 --> 1:15:15.144
- I don't even
know why I'm here.

1:15:15.178 --> 1:15:17.146
I don't even know why
I'm trying to help you.

1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:19.148
- Drink it.

1:15:19.182 --> 1:15:23.587
- All I know is...
I wanna help.

1:15:24.788 --> 1:15:26.289
- Drink it.

1:15:26.322 --> 1:15:28.091
- I can help.

1:15:28.124 --> 1:15:32.562
And I will help if you
allow that to happen.

1:15:34.230 --> 1:15:36.933
- Please drink it right now.

1:15:42.338 --> 1:15:46.309
- Look, tomorrow opportunity
is literally calling.

1:15:46.342 --> 1:15:48.077
(chuckles)

1:15:48.111 --> 1:15:49.879
Just be smart enough to answer.

1:15:50.980 --> 1:15:53.316
And you know what, open
a window in this place.

1:15:53.349 --> 1:15:55.752
It smells like shit.

1:15:56.352 --> 1:15:58.554
(growling)

1:16:04.293 --> 1:16:06.763
(loud buzzing)

1:16:17.140 --> 1:16:18.241
- Hey Benson,
I'm sorry to wake ya,

1:16:18.274 --> 1:16:20.076
I just want to tell
you three things:

1:16:20.109 --> 1:16:21.344
number one, I hate
this fucking job,

1:16:21.377 --> 1:16:23.279
number two, I fucking hate you,

1:16:23.312 --> 1:16:25.915
and number three, I quit.

1:16:25.949 --> 1:16:27.717
I'm fucking done.

1:16:27.751 --> 1:16:29.152
Bye.

1:16:32.789 --> 1:16:34.123
- Well, Rich, I've brought you

1:16:34.157 --> 1:16:35.291
everything that you need to know

1:16:35.324 --> 1:16:37.293
about the new CF-140 line.

1:16:37.326 --> 1:16:40.229
Um, Derek's not in yet but
when he does get here

1:16:40.263 --> 1:16:43.299
he's gonna have your
DVD-ROM training packet.

1:16:43.332 --> 1:16:45.301
Wanna see you get started
on that right away.

1:16:45.334 --> 1:16:47.370
Good to have you on board.

1:16:47.403 --> 1:16:49.138
- [Computer voice] I'm very
sorry that your Graybar

1:16:49.172 --> 1:16:51.107
Plastic Pigment
Powder was incorrect.

1:16:51.140 --> 1:16:53.342
Graybar Plastic Pigment
Powder Coating's

1:16:53.376 --> 1:16:55.879
goal is 100% satisfaction.

1:16:55.912 --> 1:16:59.282
100% satisfaction is
Graybar Plastic Pigment

1:16:59.315 --> 1:17:01.117
Powder Coating's
first and only goal.

1:17:01.150 --> 1:17:03.119
That and manufacturing
the finest

1:17:03.152 --> 1:17:06.856
plastic pigment powder
coating for our customers.

1:17:06.890 --> 1:17:11.861
You're saying you ordered
the FS-16473 aircraft gray.

1:17:11.895 --> 1:17:14.898
FS-36622 camel gray.

1:17:15.899 --> 1:17:17.233
Yes, but I'm looking
at it right here, sir,

1:17:17.266 --> 1:17:20.236
and the order you placed on
Graybar Plastic
Pigment Coating

1:17:20.269 --> 1:17:25.374
online form is for
FS-36622 camel gray.

1:17:27.811 --> 1:17:30.279
- (robot voice): What's up?
Hey, new guy.

1:17:30.313 --> 1:17:31.414
Kenny's brother, right?

1:17:31.447 --> 1:17:32.548
- Yeah.

1:17:32.581 --> 1:17:34.350
- I'm Derek, the one everybody
talks about around here.

1:17:34.383 --> 1:17:37.420
Welcome to Graybar and the
relentless revolution of

1:17:37.453 --> 1:17:39.288
powder coating for
sports plastics.

1:17:39.322 --> 1:17:41.891
Albert told me to give
you this instructional set

1:17:41.925 --> 1:17:44.994
of DVD-ROMs,
it's a 13-DVD-ROM set

1:17:45.028 --> 1:17:46.730
with an online
quiz at the end.

1:17:46.763 --> 1:17:48.297
Each module takes about
40 minutes to complete,

1:17:48.331 --> 1:17:49.298
I can do it in 30.

1:17:49.332 --> 1:17:52.435
This, uh, "Slips, Trips,
and Falls" is scratched.

1:17:52.468 --> 1:17:53.336
You don't need to
worry about it because

1:17:53.369 --> 1:17:54.203
you don't even need
to watch that one.

1:17:54.237 --> 1:17:56.139
We got a hard copy
of the ditto quiz

1:17:56.172 --> 1:17:57.440
module for you to complete.

1:17:57.473 --> 1:17:59.342
Make sure you finish all DVD-ROM

1:17:59.375 --> 1:18:01.077
modules before next Wednesday.

1:18:01.110 --> 1:18:05.314
That's uh...
18th, I think.

1:18:05.348 --> 1:18:07.383
We got another new guy
coming in next week

1:18:07.416 --> 1:18:08.451
and we don't have a spare set.
(high-pitched sounds)

1:18:08.484 --> 1:18:10.787
Also Stephanie in payroll,
she send you an email

1:18:10.820 --> 1:18:12.321
stating there was
some kind of a problem

1:18:12.355 --> 1:18:13.322
with your routing
number you wrote

1:18:13.356 --> 1:18:14.958
on your direct deposit form?

1:18:14.991 --> 1:18:16.425
Get that fixed.

1:18:16.459 --> 1:18:18.461
(muffled voices)
If you don't get that email,
Virgil comes in Monday...

1:18:18.494 --> 1:18:20.463
Plastic pigment
powder coating...

1:18:20.496 --> 1:18:23.466
...a lot for you to swallow and
sometimes this job blows ass.

1:18:23.499 --> 1:18:25.769
It'll really suck if
we merge with Dual Core

1:18:25.802 --> 1:18:27.403
in the next seven years
and the rumors are true.

1:18:27.436 --> 1:18:30.473
Nancy, Ethan, Lucas, me: we go
to Shepherd Dave's
(demonic voice): on Tuesdays.

1:18:30.506 --> 1:18:31.941
Free onion ring
blossom with a purchase

1:18:31.975 --> 1:18:34.343
of two margaritas or
20-ounce brewmeisters.

1:18:34.377 --> 1:18:36.079
You can't beat that.
(demonic voice): You can't.

1:18:36.112 --> 1:18:37.480
(muffled voices)
We do karaoke every Friday...

1:18:37.513 --> 1:18:39.015
...Graybar plastic pigment
powder coating...

1:18:39.048 --> 1:18:41.484
...if you're interested.
If you do, you could be our
fourth man for carpool.

1:18:41.517 --> 1:18:44.120
Actually, you could save me
a butt-ton of money.

1:18:44.153 --> 1:18:46.089
Fifteen bucks...
Gas prices went up.

1:18:46.122 --> 1:18:48.091
Fax me your number.

1:18:48.124 --> 1:18:51.127
(amplified sounds)

1:18:51.861 --> 1:18:53.362
...free pitchers if
you show your boobs,

1:18:53.396 --> 1:18:56.966
doesn't say that it doesn't
apply to guys so, I go in there.
(clicks tongue)

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:58.501
Hey, gotta give me my free beer.
(laughs)

1:18:58.534 --> 1:19:00.369
Know what I mean? So, anyway.

1:19:00.403 --> 1:19:03.739
DVD-ROM modules,
get to them man.

1:19:05.408 --> 1:19:08.311
- Benson, hey guess what?
I had another epiphany.

1:19:08.344 --> 1:19:09.445
Yeah I know what I
have to do and I just

1:19:09.478 --> 1:19:11.147
wanna fucking do this shit, man,

1:19:11.180 --> 1:19:12.315
I wanna make a difference, okay?

1:19:12.348 --> 1:19:16.385
It's like what Vermin said
in the movie Warriors,

1:19:16.419 --> 1:19:19.188
we came this far, we're gonna
go the rest of the way.

1:19:20.890 --> 1:19:24.293
- [Benson] Good, that's
very good actually.

1:19:24.327 --> 1:19:26.195
I have a job for you right away.

1:19:26.229 --> 1:19:28.331
I had to put you
on cleanup detail.

1:19:28.364 --> 1:19:31.034
I gotta send you back.

1:19:31.067 --> 1:19:32.535
- Back?

1:19:32.568 --> 1:19:33.536
Where?

1:19:33.569 --> 1:19:35.771
(loud knocking)

1:19:44.313 --> 1:19:47.884
- Hey, horse girl.

1:19:49.252 --> 1:19:51.254
You clean up nice.

1:19:55.458 --> 1:19:59.262
I like what you did with
your hair and everything.

1:20:17.113 --> 1:20:19.315
- Four days.

1:20:19.348 --> 1:20:22.551
She's been like
this for four days.

1:20:25.488 --> 1:20:31.227
She doesn't talk to me,
she doesn't recognize me.

1:20:34.463 --> 1:20:36.099
She sews.

1:20:41.337 --> 1:20:45.374
And the thing is, I don't
even know where she gets it.

1:20:45.408 --> 1:20:47.443
- What?

1:20:47.476 --> 1:20:49.178
- The fabric.

1:20:54.383 --> 1:20:56.219
Mr. Vanuk?

1:20:56.252 --> 1:20:57.620
- Rich.

1:20:57.653 --> 1:20:58.687
- Rich?

1:20:58.721 --> 1:21:00.623
- No formalities,
I'm not the pope or anything.

1:21:00.656 --> 1:21:02.858
Just Rich.

1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:09.165
- She's got my sickness.

1:21:10.666 --> 1:21:13.102
- I can fix this.

1:21:36.125 --> 1:21:37.560
Stretch.

1:21:49.472 --> 1:21:52.075
It's just you and me, buddy.

1:22:30.379 --> 1:22:36.319
- I thought that bawling,
sniveling quim
would never leave.

1:22:36.352 --> 1:22:39.355
We have words to exchange.

1:22:40.289 --> 1:22:43.559
We and you.

1:22:48.097 --> 1:22:51.534
- You know, you're lucky that
that shit's black material

1:22:51.567 --> 1:22:54.670
because nothing gets
blood stains out.
(punches table)

1:22:55.771 --> 1:23:00.043
- Is this the part where
you infuriate us with words?

1:23:00.076 --> 1:23:02.745
Play the sharp-tongued
drunkard?

1:23:02.778 --> 1:23:06.182
Or the incessant fool?

1:23:08.451 --> 1:23:11.287
Some of us hate you.

1:23:14.490 --> 1:23:18.694
- Well, you're wrong,
'cos everyone hates me.

1:23:18.727 --> 1:23:20.229
What are you sewing?

1:23:20.263 --> 1:23:23.299
- Swaddling cloth.

1:23:23.332 --> 1:23:26.635
- Swaddling cloth. For whom?

1:23:28.271 --> 1:23:29.638
- For you.

1:23:32.641 --> 1:23:35.411
- Whatever you think,
it's not mine.

1:23:35.444 --> 1:23:38.247
Okay, you were all over
me last time I was here

1:23:38.281 --> 1:23:41.117
and that's cool, you're a
hot chick and yes I would

1:23:41.150 --> 1:23:43.452
go out with you, but you know,
this job of mine,

1:23:43.486 --> 1:23:45.788
I've been limp for
fucking two weeks.

1:23:45.821 --> 1:23:47.556
- Some of us would
fight you because

1:23:47.590 --> 1:23:49.792
we do not see your use.

1:23:49.825 --> 1:23:54.130
We want to see
you gibbeted...

1:23:54.163 --> 1:23:57.533
dance in your
whiskey-soaked innards.

1:23:57.566 --> 1:24:01.437
We would nail the gate
shut to keep you out.

1:24:01.470 --> 1:24:05.040
Locking the door
makes one a prisoner.

1:24:05.841 --> 1:24:08.043
Your brother is not yet born.

1:24:10.479 --> 1:24:12.081
(machine stops)

1:24:14.850 --> 1:24:18.254
Are you going to
take my picture?

1:24:21.124 --> 1:24:22.458
- Yeah.

1:24:23.126 --> 1:24:25.594
Hold on one second.

1:24:30.599 --> 1:24:31.700
Cheese.

1:24:36.805 --> 1:24:40.809
Shit, this thing always jams up.

1:24:41.410 --> 1:24:44.447
All right, it's an antique,
but it works, okay?

1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:47.316
All right, let's do this again.

1:24:47.350 --> 1:24:50.419
- No. Put it away.

1:24:50.453 --> 1:24:51.687
- What?

1:24:54.623 --> 1:24:55.891
Why don't you want
your picture taken?

1:24:55.924 --> 1:24:57.360
- Because we'll
give you something

1:24:57.393 --> 1:24:59.728
better to remember us by.

1:25:01.264 --> 1:25:03.232
(suspenseful music *)

1:25:36.665 --> 1:25:39.134
(classical music *)

1:25:44.940 --> 1:25:47.543
(no sound other than music)

1:27:11.294 --> 1:27:14.530
(music ends,
loud applause)

1:27:23.339 --> 1:27:25.240
(knocking)

1:27:29.712 --> 1:27:32.315
- Who the hell are you?

1:27:32.348 --> 1:27:34.016
And I tell you what
the problem is,

1:27:34.049 --> 1:27:35.718
it's those god damn
horror movies.

1:27:35.751 --> 1:27:38.321
He lays in there weeks on
end making those masks,

1:27:38.354 --> 1:27:39.622
those god damn masks.

1:27:39.655 --> 1:27:41.390
What are they good for, huh?

1:27:41.424 --> 1:27:42.591
Like the devil's in there.

1:27:42.625 --> 1:27:45.027
I told the little son of a
bitch, you join the military.

1:27:45.060 --> 1:27:49.264
You need to go to
god damn church.

1:27:50.933 --> 1:27:52.735
What's that, camo?

1:27:52.768 --> 1:27:54.303
- Yeah, that's camo.

1:27:54.337 --> 1:27:55.270
- You in the military?

1:27:55.304 --> 1:28:00.509
- Yeah, a long time
ago I was in the shit.

1:28:00.543 --> 1:28:01.644
- You a religious man?

1:28:01.677 --> 1:28:03.412
- Yeah, kinda.

1:28:03.446 --> 1:28:07.650
I listened to the Bible
for five minutes on CD.

1:28:09.084 --> 1:28:11.053
James Earl Jones read it.

1:28:12.688 --> 1:28:15.057
That's Darth Vader.

1:28:15.090 --> 1:28:19.462
The voice, not the
guy in the suit.

1:28:19.495 --> 1:28:22.765
- You go on in there,
you got five minutes.

1:28:22.798 --> 1:28:25.834
Get it done, get the fuck out.

1:28:27.636 --> 1:28:30.072
(carnival music *)

1:28:34.577 --> 1:28:36.679
(growling)

1:29:04.740 --> 1:29:06.709
(laughing)

1:29:12.147 --> 1:29:14.349
(chuckles)

1:29:15.751 --> 1:29:16.952
- What?

1:29:18.454 --> 1:29:20.355
This is ridiculous.

1:29:26.161 --> 1:29:28.597
Why are you fuckers scary?

1:29:28.631 --> 1:29:30.365
Okay, you know...

1:29:53.689 --> 1:29:56.124
Is this seat taken?

1:30:08.070 --> 1:30:10.005
Sorry.

1:30:10.038 --> 1:30:11.907
Broke it, I think.

1:30:11.940 --> 1:30:13.942
I don't know, is she
supposed to do that?

1:30:27.255 --> 1:30:29.458
(doll laughing)

1:30:42.671 --> 1:30:47.075
I dig your masks,
they're really good, man.

1:30:48.544 --> 1:30:50.012
I like the one you
got going on here,

1:30:50.045 --> 1:30:53.682
it looks like Cyrano de
Bergerac meets Rocketeer.

1:30:53.716 --> 1:30:57.686
It was funny, my dad
let me watch The Exorcist

1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:01.089
in third grade but he would
never let me touch Robocop.

1:31:01.123 --> 1:31:04.793
"It's too violent,
you can't watch that shit."

1:31:04.827 --> 1:31:06.495
Guess they wanted to
teach me something

1:31:06.529 --> 1:31:10.032
or scare the shit out of me
but it didn't really work.

1:31:10.533 --> 1:31:12.535
(liquid hitting floor)

1:31:36.291 --> 1:31:37.893
(bones crunching)

1:31:41.630 --> 1:31:46.769
- The only way to give
light is to burn, Richard.

1:31:46.802 --> 1:31:49.905
Oh, and you will burn.

1:32:02.084 --> 1:32:03.686
(music ends *)

1:32:04.219 --> 1:32:06.154
(tapping)

1:32:36.084 --> 1:32:37.686
(retching)

1:32:43.826 --> 1:32:45.227
(dialing phone)

1:32:47.229 --> 1:32:49.197
(ringing)

1:32:51.366 --> 1:32:52.968
(line busy)

1:32:56.004 --> 1:32:58.573
(ominous music *)

1:33:06.815 --> 1:33:08.617
(glass breaking)

1:33:21.396 --> 1:33:22.998
(dialing phone)

1:33:25.968 --> 1:33:27.369
(phone ringing)

1:33:27.402 --> 1:33:29.004
Come on, man.

1:33:29.738 --> 1:33:30.739
Just pick up.

1:33:39.948 --> 1:33:43.251
- Hey, hey!
Hey man, how you doing?

1:33:44.419 --> 1:33:45.654
Yeah?

1:33:49.424 --> 1:33:51.727
Yeah, it's all good, man.

1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:54.129
It's good. Me?

1:33:54.162 --> 1:33:59.167
Me?
You know... I've been...

1:34:02.738 --> 1:34:06.008
Fuck it. Me?

1:34:06.041 --> 1:34:12.180
[stuttering]
That was nothing.
That was just nothing, okay?

1:34:12.214 --> 1:34:16.218
Look, you're probably
wondering why I'm calling...

1:34:16.785 --> 1:34:19.654
Because I'm just wondering...

1:34:21.356 --> 1:34:23.358
Do you have any jobs available?

1:34:25.193 --> 1:34:30.833
Anything at all, like...
any time soon?

1:34:36.204 --> 1:34:42.845
Yeah, I mean, dude,
it doesn't need to

1:34:42.878 --> 1:34:45.814
an exorcism or anything,
none of that crap,

1:34:45.848 --> 1:34:51.453
I can-- if your office needs
painting or marketing

1:34:51.486 --> 1:34:55.924
I'm one hell of a
fucking writer, man.
One hell of a fucking writer.

1:34:55.958 --> 1:34:58.727
Just broke, man.
All I got to my name
is just cough syrup.

1:34:58.761 --> 1:35:02.998
I'm broke, I guess I put
myself out of business.

1:35:03.031 --> 1:35:03.932
(laughing)

1:35:03.966 --> 1:35:05.467
I gotta pay my bills too.

1:35:05.500 --> 1:35:07.936
Hurts good, hurts bad.
Yeah! Really bad.

1:35:07.970 --> 1:35:10.338
Okay.
Are we out of business?

1:35:10.372 --> 1:35:14.276
You gotta promise me,
man, if anything comes up,

1:35:14.309 --> 1:35:17.112
I'll be the first
to know, right?

1:35:18.847 --> 1:35:19.982
Yeah.

1:35:23.318 --> 1:35:25.320
Okay, yeah.

1:35:29.457 --> 1:35:30.392
Thanks.

1:36:00.555 --> 1:36:02.157
(weeping)

1:36:04.559 --> 1:36:06.761
(yelling)

1:36:11.466 --> 1:36:14.436
- Fuck, this machine
isn't fucking working!

1:36:17.105 --> 1:36:18.273
- Welcome back.

1:36:18.306 --> 1:36:20.542
- Thanks, it's awful to be back.

1:36:20.575 --> 1:36:23.445
Can I please have a beer?

1:36:23.478 --> 1:36:26.849
- Yeah, I can get you a beer.
Your tab is covered.

1:36:26.882 --> 1:36:27.682
- What?

1:36:27.715 --> 1:36:30.385
- Yeah, just covered
your tab for ya.

1:36:31.954 --> 1:36:33.421
- No shit?

1:36:34.990 --> 1:36:37.960
Fuck yeah, the usual?

1:36:44.532 --> 1:36:45.367
(burps)

1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:48.303
- So, even if you
swam in raw sewage

1:36:48.336 --> 1:36:50.405
I'd fuck the shit out you.
(men laughing)

1:37:06.354 --> 1:37:09.624
- They just supplied the
color for the plastics,

1:37:09.657 --> 1:37:13.261
they didn't make the sports
products or anything.

1:37:13.295 --> 1:37:16.231
- So what do you do?

1:37:17.632 --> 1:37:18.833
- Guess.

1:37:19.902 --> 1:37:24.039
- Judging by your eyes,
you're not a lazy fellow.

1:37:25.273 --> 1:37:27.976
I've got it, a writer.

1:37:28.010 --> 1:37:30.478
- And a shitty one at that.

1:37:30.512 --> 1:37:33.048
Ah, I used to tinker
with writing from

1:37:33.081 --> 1:37:36.084
time to time as a hobby.

1:37:36.118 --> 1:37:40.989
- You're... I give up,
what the hell are you?

1:37:44.159 --> 1:37:46.194
(cheering)

1:37:50.232 --> 1:37:53.969
I'm into therapy.
Healin'.

1:37:54.002 --> 1:37:56.438
- So you're into medicine?

1:37:58.106 --> 1:37:59.641
- Yeah, kinda.

1:38:00.342 --> 1:38:02.410
I'm a rare item.

1:38:02.444 --> 1:38:04.212
I don't have a
pot to piss in and

1:38:04.246 --> 1:38:07.049
I don't really enjoy my job.

1:38:07.082 --> 1:38:10.652
Thought I did for
a little bit but,

1:38:10.685 --> 1:38:13.888
I guess I really don't
have to live this way.

1:38:15.991 --> 1:38:17.559
But I choose to.

1:38:19.561 --> 1:38:23.465
- So what do you do?

1:38:23.498 --> 1:38:26.568
- I heal, therefore, I drink.

1:38:28.436 --> 1:38:31.573
- So are you Jesus or something?

1:38:31.606 --> 1:38:35.210
- No, no, I'm not white enough.
(laughs)

1:38:37.379 --> 1:38:38.380
No, I'm--

1:38:45.287 --> 1:38:47.122
- What's going on?

1:38:47.155 --> 1:38:48.290
- Not much.

1:38:48.323 --> 1:38:49.357
- I got an idea.
- What's that?

1:38:49.391 --> 1:38:51.693
- Why don't we swap numbers
then swap some spit?

1:38:51.726 --> 1:38:53.962
What do you think about that?

1:38:53.996 --> 1:38:54.696
Be all right?

1:38:54.729 --> 1:38:56.031
- I like it.

1:38:56.064 --> 1:38:58.166
- Good. Right.

Hey, bartender.

Silver Foam, Boysenberry IPA.

1:39:02.270 --> 1:39:08.276
- Oh, simply a Burgess choice
there, Burgess Belle.

1:39:08.310 --> 1:39:09.677
- It's good shit, you
should try it sometime.

1:39:09.711 --> 1:39:11.446
- Simply a marvelous drink.

1:39:11.479 --> 1:39:14.116
A simply Burgess
drink for someone

1:39:14.149 --> 1:39:17.385
by the name of
Burgess fucking Belle.

1:39:17.419 --> 1:39:20.488
- Oh, I found out you're
just a cocksucker,

1:39:20.522 --> 1:39:22.457
you're not a cocksucking priest.

1:39:22.490 --> 1:39:25.093
You're just a cocksucking homo.

1:39:25.127 --> 1:39:27.395
(men jeering)

1:39:27.429 --> 1:39:29.097
- Well it's true, but,

1:39:29.131 --> 1:39:34.336
only dicksuckers drink that
boysenberry skunk anus juice.

1:39:34.369 --> 1:39:35.970
- You can't tell
me what to drink.

1:39:36.004 --> 1:39:38.740
- Go fuck yourself, I can
tell you what to drink.
- Don't tell me what to drink!

1:39:38.773 --> 1:39:40.442
- I'll tell you to
drink whatever the fuck

1:39:40.475 --> 1:39:42.144
I want you to drink!

1:39:42.177 --> 1:39:44.679
- I'll drink whatever
the fuck I want!
Who's paying rent?!

1:39:44.712 --> 1:39:46.348
- How 'bout half?!

1:39:46.381 --> 1:39:49.251
- That's it, faggot. Outside.

1:39:49.284 --> 1:39:51.019
- Giddy up!

1:39:51.153 --> 1:39:53.321
(men cheering)

1:39:53.355 --> 1:39:56.324
Missed a spot right here,

- Hi.

1:40:42.137 --> 1:40:44.306
You should see the other guy.

1:40:45.707 --> 1:40:47.475
Why do you keep
following me around?

1:40:47.509 --> 1:40:50.412
You don't want me, I'm gross.

1:40:51.846 --> 1:40:54.249
- I like gross things.

1:41:05.593 --> 1:41:08.263
(dramatic orchestral music *)

1:42:56.438 --> 1:42:58.373
(screaming)

1:43:04.979 --> 1:43:06.948
(screaming)

1:43:06.981 --> 1:43:08.916
- God damnit, Vanuk!

1:43:08.950 --> 1:43:10.418
What the fuck?

- Give me that fucking thing!

1:43:18.426 --> 1:43:20.328
(screaming)

1:43:27.369 --> 1:43:31.939
Now we're all
in the fucking shadows,
you fucking asshole!

1:43:31.973 --> 1:43:34.442
I was gonna bang that chick!

1:43:34.476 --> 1:43:37.545
God damnit show yourself!

You come out, come
out wherever you are!

1:43:42.350 --> 1:43:43.651
You fuck!

1:43:43.685 --> 1:43:48.590
This is what I fought
all night to get back to!

1:43:48.623 --> 1:43:50.458
(loud smashing)

1:44:19.521 --> 1:44:21.323
(screaming)

1:44:24.058 --> 1:44:26.260
(sobbing indistinctly)

1:44:39.006 --> 1:44:41.275
(laughing)

1:44:53.688 --> 1:44:56.290
Can you dig it?!

1:44:56.491 --> 1:45:00.995
Can you dig it?!!

1:45:07.669 --> 1:45:09.571
(sirens wailing)

1:45:12.106 --> 1:45:14.308
(coughing)

1:45:36.831 --> 1:45:38.800
(loud growling)

1:45:52.146 --> 1:45:54.348
(teeth gnashing)

1:45:58.152 --> 1:45:59.854
You real?

1:46:03.491 --> 1:46:04.892
Jesus Christ.

1:46:06.561 --> 1:46:08.830
Well, this makes sense.

1:46:20.675 --> 1:46:22.710
(phone ringing)

1:46:44.532 --> 1:46:45.533
(ringing stops)
