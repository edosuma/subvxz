00:20.720 --> 00:23.480
Et dimitte a nobis...

00:23.480 --> 00:25.920
..debita nostra sicut

00:25.920 --> 00:29.160
et nos dimittimus a debitoribus nostris.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.600
Only you can save us from
the beast, Sir William.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.280
God bless and keep
you in this enterprise.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.360
Father.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.400
Sir William.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.880
Will you take this for your protection?

01:03.240 --> 01:04.959
It will keep you from fear.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.760
My lady.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.440
Where is he?

02:23.680 --> 02:25.640
Where's Rex?

02:25.640 --> 02:29.000
Jack...where's Rex?

02:30.680 --> 02:33.080
He's with my mate, Tony.
I said he could borrow him.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.800
He loves lizards.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.480
You idiot! He's bringing
him back this morning,

02:38.480 --> 02:40.280
I swear.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.520
He better be here by the
time I get back from work.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.120
He's just a stupid lizard.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.440
Show some respect, Jack!

02:54.440 --> 02:56.600
Reptiles have feelings too, you know.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.560
Who's there?

04:11.360 --> 04:13.120
Connor? Yo.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.280
Something suspicious
has come up on the Net.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.240
What kind of suspicious?

04:17.240 --> 04:18.880
Have a look.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.040
Rex. What?

04:27.040 --> 04:29.400
Huh? Oh, no.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.200
That's just a bearded dragon.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.880
I am gonna kill Jack.

04:33.760 --> 04:37.200
Really? That's a good idea
(!) Any particular reason?

04:37.200 --> 04:39.320
He lent Rex to a friend.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.200
Isn't that what you just said? Me?

04:42.200 --> 04:44.040
What? When?

04:44.040 --> 04:46.560
When you looked at the
screen, you said, "Rex."

04:47.600 --> 04:50.680
Next. I said, "Next," as in,
you know, "We've done that.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.520
What else have you got?"

04:52.520 --> 04:54.760
Whatever. Are you OK?

04:54.760 --> 04:57.840
So we don't need to take any
action? No action. OK, fine.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.200
Action? What action? Nothing, nothing.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.240
What's with all the...questions?

05:05.040 --> 05:08.160
So Jack definitely
said he lent him to...?

05:08.160 --> 05:10.120
Yes. Why?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.000
Stop.

05:27.440 --> 05:31.240
Hello? 'Jack, do me a favour.'

05:31.240 --> 05:34.080
Explain to me why Rex is up
for auction on the Internet.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.080
Gambled him at poker.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.120
You had no right to use Rex
to pay off your gambling debt.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.000
What do you think student loans are for?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.320
Get him back. How? 'Just do it.'

05:45.080 --> 05:46.680
OK?

06:19.280 --> 06:21.280
So where is it? Not far.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.000
Where are you going?

06:23.000 --> 06:26.040
Danny, I am sick of working on
the artifact. I need a break.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.800
No, no, no. We need you
here. Well, I'm coming.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.440
He's gonna kill it.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.160
Yeah!

07:41.920 --> 07:44.000
This is madness. Come on!

07:47.720 --> 07:49.400
Stop! Oi!

07:49.400 --> 07:51.000
Stop!

07:55.040 --> 07:57.440
Get him out of there! MAN: Oi, what?

07:59.400 --> 08:01.880
What is that thing?
You don't wanna know.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.680
It's injured. We have to help it.
Afraid you were gonna say that.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.440
Abby!

08:07.440 --> 08:09.520
Sarah, wait! Get back! I can help.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.440
We're gonna push it back to the anomaly.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.760
If it's gonna die, it's gonna die
in its own world. It's not gonna die.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.800
Where's the anomaly?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.560
It's close.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.320
Abby, how's it injured?

08:20.320 --> 08:22.480
It's got something stuck in its side.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.920
Abby!

08:32.320 --> 08:34.000
Oi!

08:34.559 --> 08:36.200
Oi!

08:38.679 --> 08:40.799
Danny! I'll make a noise.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.720
Go on.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.480
Go.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Grab something.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.200
Go on!

09:08.960 --> 09:10.880
That was easy.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.600
Why is it coming back?

09:24.560 --> 09:29.720
Ego in Abysso sum! Meam
quaesitionem persequor. Ad Gloriam.

09:41.470 --> 09:43.710
Anyone else? Hey?

09:43.710 --> 09:46.670
Well, we've had a dragon,
a knight in shining armour...

09:46.670 --> 09:49.790
A damsel in distress would be nice.
It's not a real dragon, though.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.550
Dracorex, late cretaceous, herbivore.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.270
It's still dangerous. It's wounded.

09:56.070 --> 09:58.790
Close the anomaly. We'll
try and get it back to you.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.630
What did he say, anyway?

10:21.630 --> 10:24.550
"This is Hell. I carry on
to Glory." You speak Latin?

10:24.550 --> 10:27.630
A copper can't have a classical
education? No, I didn't say that.

10:27.630 --> 10:29.910
It's just it was more, "This is Hell,

10:29.910 --> 10:33.190
my quest continues onto
Glory." I was paraphrasing.

10:33.190 --> 10:36.710
The dracorex must have come through
an anomaly into Medieval England.

10:36.710 --> 10:38.910
This is a waste of
time. It's a maze here.

10:38.910 --> 10:41.430
I'm gonna go and get Connor,
we'll go after the knight.

10:41.430 --> 10:44.470
Abby, take Becker, chase down the
dragony thing. You go too, Sarah.

10:44.470 --> 10:46.430
Erm...Danny?

10:47.870 --> 10:49.630
I think I'll stay here.

10:49.630 --> 10:52.950
I thought you said you wanted to get
involved. I know, but you're right,

10:52.950 --> 10:54.710
I'm probably more of a back room girl.

10:54.710 --> 10:57.950
Look, if you're frightened, it's
nothing to be ashamed of. Yeah.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.910
I'll keep that in mind.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.030
He's on the high
street! He's over there!

12:00.750 --> 12:02.510
Come on!

12:24.870 --> 12:26.630
It's over there.

12:28.990 --> 12:30.710
Don't lose it.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.270
Die!

13:00.150 --> 13:01.830
Die!

13:02.510 --> 13:04.230
Our knight?

13:04.230 --> 13:06.630
So what happens when we
actually catch up with him?

13:06.630 --> 13:09.230
We sit and talk to him like
rational human beings. Yeah?

13:09.230 --> 13:10.950
Yeah.

13:20.510 --> 13:22.470
I think we found it.

13:23.710 --> 13:25.470
I don't want it harmed.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.750
We use tranquillisers. Is that clear?

13:27.750 --> 13:30.590
Look, it's my job to protect
you, not the creatures.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.150
All right?

14:36.990 --> 14:39.190
Bye. Thanks.

14:56.590 --> 14:59.190
Stand back, demon.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.950
We're not demons. We're flesh
and blood, just like you.

15:01.950 --> 15:05.590
You are demons and I am in Hell.

15:07.830 --> 15:09.590
Technically, it's London.

15:10.270 --> 15:12.230
But it's an easy mistake to make.

15:12.230 --> 15:14.270
We can help you get home.

15:14.270 --> 15:18.950
My only way home is to slay the
beast and to complete my quest.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.830
Killing the dragon
will not get you back.

15:20.830 --> 15:23.270
It's not a dragon. We can help you.

15:33.710 --> 15:35.390
I know this seems weird, but -

15:38.910 --> 15:40.550
Peasants.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.830
Look, we're never gonna find him.

16:08.830 --> 16:12.190
Danny, he's wearing a full suit
of armour and carrying a sword.

16:12.190 --> 16:14.310
Even in London, that's
gonna get noticed.

16:14.310 --> 16:16.670
Don't worry, he's gonna
stand out like a sore...

16:21.430 --> 16:23.150
..thumb.

16:35.510 --> 16:37.230
Don't ask.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.150
Just unlock the anomaly.

16:39.150 --> 16:40.870
Well...

16:40.870 --> 16:42.990
Look, Lester instructed it.

16:42.990 --> 16:44.950
You sure? Yes, I'm sure.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.510
OK.

16:48.550 --> 16:51.550
Right, as soon as I get
through, seal it again,

16:51.550 --> 16:54.270
and then unlock it in exactly
an hour's time. You got that?

16:54.270 --> 16:56.350
Yeah.

16:58.070 --> 16:59.790
Wish me luck.

17:27.390 --> 17:29.030
No.

17:30.110 --> 17:33.230
I told you, I don't
want it to be harmed.

17:36.070 --> 17:37.910
Abby, what are you doing?

17:38.790 --> 17:40.590
Go, go, go!

17:41.430 --> 17:43.350
Yargh!

17:51.350 --> 17:53.830
If it comes any closer,
I'm going to kill it.

17:53.830 --> 17:55.990
That is not the answer. (ROARS)

18:07.630 --> 18:09.310
I think you should take a look at it.

18:15.190 --> 18:16.910
Hey.

18:17.590 --> 18:20.230
It's OK, we're not gonna hurt you.

18:22.710 --> 18:25.990
Looks as if it's on its last
legs. Yeah, we need to get it back.

18:25.990 --> 18:28.110
Yeah, how? Well...

18:28.990 --> 18:32.550
that's your department.
Oh, dinosaur transportation?

18:33.710 --> 18:35.830
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

19:22.990 --> 19:25.670
Hurry up, we haven't got much time.

19:25.670 --> 19:27.630
Here's your field hospital.

19:29.430 --> 19:31.190
Hang in there, dragon.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.550
I know this place.

20:04.430 --> 20:06.510
Ooh, very nice.

20:17.030 --> 20:18.870
All right, mate?

20:19.710 --> 20:21.670
Nice costume.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.390
Recycled, is it?

20:31.350 --> 20:33.390
Satan?

20:33.390 --> 20:35.950
No, his name's Brian, actually.

20:43.190 --> 20:45.590
The mark of the beast! Sling your 'ook!

20:45.590 --> 20:47.910
Oi, you two. Take it outside now.

20:49.670 --> 20:51.630
Take it outside!

21:16.950 --> 21:18.550
Sir Lancelot? Yeah.

21:27.470 --> 21:29.430
Satan!

21:32.310 --> 21:33.990
Oi!

21:35.030 --> 21:38.310
See how your master cowers before me!

21:38.310 --> 21:40.470
I don't think he's who you think he is.

21:41.990 --> 21:45.390
How many demons must I slay this day?

21:45.390 --> 21:47.750
Sort something out.
I'll keep him busy. What?

21:47.750 --> 21:49.470
Go on.

21:49.470 --> 21:51.150
Can't we just talk about this?

21:52.190 --> 21:54.190
Obviously not. What's that up there?

21:58.750 --> 22:00.710
Ah, that's just made
you cross, hasn't it?

22:12.350 --> 22:15.590
You are too feeble an
opponent to be worth killing.

22:15.590 --> 22:17.470
But do not try my patience again.

22:20.510 --> 22:22.670
State of my pub!

22:22.670 --> 22:24.310
Quick! We can't lose him!

22:25.150 --> 22:27.150
This is worse than the wife's hen night!

22:29.230 --> 22:31.310
Oh, it's all right.
You can come out now.

22:43.470 --> 22:45.510
Gotcha!

22:45.510 --> 22:47.670
Now what?

22:51.230 --> 22:53.190
Come on!

23:01.090 --> 23:02.850
Stop.

23:02.850 --> 23:04.650
We need a vet. I'll call the ARC.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.690
There's not enough time.

23:06.690 --> 23:08.810
I'm gonna have to do it.

23:27.090 --> 23:28.890
You can do this, Abby.

23:36.410 --> 23:38.210
Come on, I need your help. Right.

23:39.490 --> 23:42.050
Right, so put your hands
round there and pull. Yep.

23:42.050 --> 23:43.730
OK. Just really steady.

23:51.290 --> 23:52.970
Not gonna let you die, dragon.

24:16.490 --> 24:18.330
Halt!

24:18.330 --> 24:20.330
Are you a witch? No.

24:21.170 --> 24:22.890
Oh. Why?

24:22.890 --> 24:25.290
You were out there and
the dragon didn't eat you.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.370
I hid.

24:27.370 --> 24:29.810
How long have you been in here
- in the church?

24:29.810 --> 24:31.690
Since the dragon came.

24:31.690 --> 24:33.890
But the knight will save us. Really?

24:34.650 --> 24:38.810
And who is this knight?
Sir William de Mornay.

24:40.010 --> 24:41.850
Where are you from?

24:41.850 --> 24:45.130
Well, I'm from a place
that's very, very far away.

24:45.130 --> 24:48.090
The Holy Land? Bit further than that.

24:48.890 --> 24:50.610
Tell me more about the village.

24:51.770 --> 24:53.410
Why should I?

24:54.250 --> 24:55.970
Good question.

24:58.690 --> 25:00.570
There you go. That's why.

25:01.770 --> 25:03.490
It looks like mud.

25:03.490 --> 25:05.490
It certainly doesn't taste like mud.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.530
Go on.

25:14.810 --> 25:18.050
Hey, slow down. That stuff
can ruin your teeth, OK?

25:20.770 --> 25:23.370
Know what? Here, have the whole bar.

25:24.890 --> 25:27.130
So, what else do you wanna know?

25:27.130 --> 25:29.570
Well, this knight...

26:14.970 --> 26:16.810
You never saw me, this didn't happen.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.530
Right. Good.

26:30.490 --> 26:32.210
Bingo.

26:54.730 --> 26:56.450
We should split up? Split up?

26:56.450 --> 26:59.130
I'm not splitting up. Have
you not seen horror films?

26:59.130 --> 27:01.210
We've got to find him
before he kills someone.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.650
It's me. Talk to me.

27:07.650 --> 27:10.890
The knight's name
- it's William de Mornay.

27:10.890 --> 27:15.530
He was a mercenary who fought all
over Europe for whoever paid him.

27:15.530 --> 27:18.850
He's killed a lot of men, Danny,
and he's looking for redemption,

27:18.850 --> 27:21.130
and he thinks killing
the dragon is gonna do it.

27:21.130 --> 27:23.210
How do you know all this?

27:23.210 --> 27:25.530
My job is to research, so I researched.

27:25.530 --> 27:28.170
Well, you're very good.
Better than you think.

27:28.170 --> 27:31.250
We have to find him. He's lost
in a world he doesn't understand.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.610
I mean, maybe he's not
trying to find the dragon.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.210
Maybe he's just trying to
get home. Well, in that case,

27:36.210 --> 27:39.490
there's a ruins of the old parish
church by the river. Shh-shh-shh.

27:39.490 --> 27:42.330
Erm...I'm sending you
the map reference now.

27:42.330 --> 27:44.490
'OK, you get Becker and meet me there.'

27:44.490 --> 27:47.050
Well, he can't at the
moment. He's helping Abby.

27:47.050 --> 27:48.770
What's he doing?

27:48.770 --> 27:50.850
She's operating on the dracorex.

27:50.850 --> 27:54.450
All right, wait for Becker and meet
me at the church. I can come now.

27:54.450 --> 27:57.250
Sarah, you do not leave
without backup. That's an order.

27:57.250 --> 27:59.290
Do you understand? I
can't hear you, Danny.

27:59.290 --> 28:01.450
'Sarah, do not hang
up!' You're breaking up.

28:01.450 --> 28:03.090
'Sarah, do not hang up the
-' Oh...

28:03.730 --> 28:05.490
shame.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.650
What's going on? How's Abby? She's fine.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.570
She's trying to save the dragon.

28:14.570 --> 28:16.210
Really?

28:17.250 --> 28:19.050
I should be with her.
Maybe I could help.

28:20.010 --> 28:21.650
Well, go on, then.

28:59.810 --> 29:01.690
Really bad time, Jack.

29:01.690 --> 29:04.090
The bidding for Rex is up to two grand.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.850
You better get hold of the cash, then.

29:05.850 --> 29:07.610
Where am I gonna get £2,000 from?

29:08.490 --> 29:10.730
There's nothing I can
do. Abby's gonna kill me.

29:10.730 --> 29:12.690
Really? She'll have to join the queue.

29:12.690 --> 29:15.650
Look, just leave it with
me. I'll think of something.

29:15.650 --> 29:17.490
OK?

29:17.490 --> 29:19.450
Thank you.

29:19.450 --> 29:21.490
How's he doing? I think the wound's OK.

29:21.490 --> 29:23.450
It's the shock that's killing him.

29:24.970 --> 29:28.930
If he survives for another
hour, I think he might make it.

29:28.930 --> 29:30.690
Is there anything I can do to help?

29:39.090 --> 29:40.770
We need to put pressure on the wound.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.170
OK.

29:45.930 --> 29:47.890
Is he OK? Yeah.

30:06.170 --> 30:08.010
My grave.

30:08.690 --> 30:10.490
I am dead and gone to Hell.

30:14.410 --> 30:16.850
I am too, God help me.

30:39.090 --> 30:40.890
William.

30:42.170 --> 30:45.170
I know none of this makes
any sense but I can explain.

30:45.170 --> 30:48.370
You just have to trust me.
Are you the devil's champion?

30:49.130 --> 30:52.490
No, I'm not the devil's
champion and you're not in Hell,

30:52.490 --> 30:54.450
but I can help you.

30:58.970 --> 31:00.690
With God on my side...

31:02.410 --> 31:04.050
..I will not be defeated.

31:08.490 --> 31:11.250
I don't want to fight you.
Because you are a coward.

31:11.250 --> 31:13.730
That's a bit harsh, isn't
it? This will be over quickly.

31:26.610 --> 31:31.730
You are an infernal imp
sent to torment my soul.

31:34.050 --> 31:36.250
You sound just like my mother.

32:57.050 --> 32:58.930
Stop! Sir William!

33:00.290 --> 33:02.530
Stop!

33:02.530 --> 33:05.530
Sir William...there's
something that you must see.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.330
Do you know what this is, William?

33:17.330 --> 33:18.890
It's my grave.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.050
I am dead and gone to Hell.

33:23.050 --> 33:24.690
You're not dead yet.

33:25.810 --> 33:27.530
See...what it says here?

33:29.330 --> 33:31.050
You have many years to live.

33:32.450 --> 33:34.570
Then why am I already
in the world to come?

33:35.610 --> 33:37.570
Look...closely.

33:42.090 --> 33:44.010
My wife lies here beside me.

33:59.930 --> 34:02.210
I have no wife. Not yet.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.210
But you will when you get back.

34:05.930 --> 34:07.890
Lady Elizabeth Langley.

34:10.010 --> 34:13.530
How do you know her? You
will marry her, William.

34:13.530 --> 34:15.610
You will have three children together.

34:19.770 --> 34:24.130
I am just a wandering
knight, far below her in rank.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.090
Listen to me. Just calm down.

34:27.090 --> 34:29.770
You must have done something
to impress her, William.

34:30.570 --> 34:32.969
You will live a long
and happy life together.

34:32.969 --> 34:35.449
It's written here...in stone.

34:35.449 --> 34:39.850
It's your fate, your destiny.
If you let us take you back.

34:40.770 --> 34:42.850
My only way back is to kill the beast.

34:42.850 --> 34:44.810
That is not your quest, William.

34:45.610 --> 34:48.650
Your quest is to leave this
place and marry Elizabeth.

34:49.929 --> 34:52.730
The beast is wounded and likely to die.

34:53.530 --> 34:55.250
Honour is satisfied.

34:55.250 --> 34:56.969
Well, you know where it is?

34:56.969 --> 34:58.730
Take me to it!

34:58.730 --> 35:01.570
Take another step and I will
dispatch her without mercy!

35:01.570 --> 35:03.690
All right. You will
not hurt me, William.

35:04.490 --> 35:06.450
It goes against all laws of chivalry.

35:16.970 --> 35:18.650
Bleeding stopped?

35:20.130 --> 35:21.930
He's gonna be OK.

35:27.530 --> 35:29.210
One tough little dragon, eh?

35:45.450 --> 35:48.410
Becker, change of plan.
I need picking up. Now.

36:01.930 --> 36:04.090
It ends at last.

36:10.050 --> 36:11.730
Out of my way.

36:12.810 --> 36:14.570
No.

36:14.570 --> 36:17.650
Out...of my way.

36:48.930 --> 36:51.090
You show strange courage for a demon.

36:51.090 --> 36:53.690
Oh, I'm a demon all right.

37:03.410 --> 37:05.210
William! William!

37:06.130 --> 37:08.090
Elizabeth is waiting for you.

37:09.010 --> 37:10.970
You have my word of honour.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.770
The dragon will never
come to your village again.

37:14.770 --> 37:17.650
Your quest can end in triumph.

37:17.650 --> 37:19.610
I am weary of killing.

37:19.610 --> 37:21.490
I know.

37:21.490 --> 37:24.810
I crave only of rest and
the pleasures of peace.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.530
And they can all be yours.

37:28.970 --> 37:31.330
If I kill the beast! No! No!

37:31.330 --> 37:33.170
I will never let you kill him!

37:33.170 --> 37:35.970
Then I will cut you both down!
Abby, move out of the way!

37:35.970 --> 37:39.330
William! Drop your weapon
and get down on your knees!

37:39.330 --> 37:41.370
Becker, no! What?!

37:41.370 --> 37:43.170
If you kill him, then history changes.

37:43.170 --> 37:47.290
His children will never be born.
And who knows where it will end.

37:48.210 --> 37:50.090
He has to go back.

37:50.090 --> 37:52.610
No, he's gonna kill Abby. Becker, do it!

37:59.290 --> 38:01.330
You would sacrifice your life...

38:02.650 --> 38:04.450
..for this savage beast?

38:05.370 --> 38:07.530
Willingly.

38:07.530 --> 38:10.690
This is not how demons
behave, is it, William?

38:15.330 --> 38:17.010
No, this is some sort of trick.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.690
No trick and in your heart, you know it.

38:21.770 --> 38:25.090
We're humans...just like you.

38:27.170 --> 38:28.810
You've done enough, William.

38:30.770 --> 38:32.690
Your quest is over.

38:54.650 --> 38:56.490
Yargh!

38:56.490 --> 38:58.330
No!

39:18.210 --> 39:19.930
I thought this might be Hell.

39:21.690 --> 39:23.730
Yeah, we got that.

39:26.850 --> 39:30.690
But if it is not... can it be paradise?

39:30.690 --> 39:33.130
Well, it's not exactly paradise, no.

39:34.330 --> 39:37.810
Thank God, for it is an awful place.

39:39.130 --> 39:41.050
Yeah, sometimes.

39:41.050 --> 39:43.090
But it's home and er...

39:43.090 --> 39:44.850
And your home is...

39:47.090 --> 39:49.210
Through there. Yeah.

40:08.930 --> 40:10.690
Sarah.

40:16.290 --> 40:19.770
Ego vos relinquo in pacis.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.210
What did he say?

40:45.010 --> 40:47.370
He said, "I depart in peace."

40:47.370 --> 40:49.810
It was more like, "I
leave you in peace."

40:50.930 --> 40:52.730
Oh, yeah.

40:53.810 --> 40:55.610
What did he leave you?

40:56.370 --> 40:59.290
It's from Jerusalem.
It's seven centuries old.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.050
Worth a few quid on eBay.

41:01.050 --> 41:02.890
Well, you expect we'll have difficulty

41:02.890 --> 41:04.690
explaining why it's still brand new.

41:05.970 --> 41:07.890
So, look, tell me something.

41:07.890 --> 41:10.450
Where did you find out all
that stuff about William?

41:11.370 --> 41:16.970
You know, a bit of luck,
intuition, a few educated guesses.

41:16.970 --> 41:19.650
Amazing. It's almost
like you were there.

41:19.650 --> 41:22.490
Well, I did tell you I
was very good, didn't I?

41:28.410 --> 41:30.410
So...

41:30.410 --> 41:32.210
what are you gonna do with the dracorex?

41:33.650 --> 41:37.410
I'm gonna wait till an anomaly
opens to the right time period

41:37.410 --> 41:39.450
and then put him back.

41:39.450 --> 41:41.290
You can't keep him, you know.

41:42.330 --> 41:45.130
I mean, for one thing, I don't
think he'd fit in the flat.

41:46.010 --> 41:47.730
I wasn't going to.

41:47.730 --> 41:49.890
Well, not forever.

41:53.530 --> 41:55.170
I've gotta go. Where?

41:55.770 --> 41:58.050
Just some stuff to...do.

42:03.370 --> 42:05.050
Open the doors!

42:07.570 --> 42:09.210
It's Sir William!

42:20.490 --> 42:22.370
The beast is...

42:22.370 --> 42:24.250
vanquished!

42:33.770 --> 42:35.570
My lady Elizabeth.

42:41.770 --> 42:43.770
I believe this is yours.

43:15.130 --> 43:16.850
I've come for the lizard.

43:16.850 --> 43:18.570
Cost you three grand.

43:19.770 --> 43:23.330
How about you bring him to me?
Or I'll come in and get him.

43:24.210 --> 43:26.290
Yeah? You and whose army?

43:33.770 --> 43:35.490
Mine...

43:35.490 --> 43:37.570
actually.

43:37.570 --> 43:39.290
You better come in.

43:39.290 --> 43:41.330
Thank you.

43:41.330 --> 43:43.290
He's found my detector.

43:43.290 --> 43:45.690
It's your responsibility
to keep that safe!

43:45.690 --> 43:47.730
He's gone through the anomaly.

43:47.730 --> 43:50.930
The bug is from the same place
as the artifact. It's possible.

43:50.930 --> 43:54.410
Which means that the future could be
just the other side of the anomaly.

43:54.410 --> 43:57.090
If those things got loose,
humanity never stood a chance.

43:59.690 --> 44:01.810
Connor, get him out of here!
