WEBVTT

00:07.908 --> 00:10.678
Rosie:
IT'S FINE-- OLD.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.282
MM-HMM.

00:14.382 --> 00:18.052
ACTUALLY, MOM, DAD SAID
HE LIKED MY HAIR.

00:21.322 --> 00:24.192
- ( bangs )
- MM-HMM.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.427
NO.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.697
ANYWAY, MOM, I GOTTA GO.
DAD'S GOING TO MAKE
BREAKFAST.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.533
YES, ON THE STOVE.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.738
OKAY, LOVE YOU TOO.
BYE.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.974
WHERE DID SHE THINK I WAS
GOING TO MAKE BREAKFAST--
IN THE WASHING MACHINE?

00:41.075 --> 00:43.644
( sighs )
SHE JUST ASSUMED
WE'D GO OUT.

00:43.744 --> 00:47.615
OH.
DID YOU-- DID YOU
WANT TO GO OUT?

00:47.715 --> 00:49.517
I DON'T CARE.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.586
I JUST DON'T WANT
A "KRAMER VS. KRAMER"
MOMENT, YOU KNOW?

00:52.686 --> 00:55.289
THAT HAPPENS TO BE ONE
OF YOUR MOM'S FAVORITE MOVIES.

00:55.389 --> 00:59.493
- ( knocks )
- AND ONE OF MINE,
INCIDENTALLY.

00:59.593 --> 01:03.364
- WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
QUITE A BIT.
- YES, IT DOES.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.336
PAUL WESTON?

01:09.303 --> 01:11.105
SIGN HERE, PLEASE.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.541
SURE.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.844
- WHAT IS IT?
- THANK YOU.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.011
THANKS.

01:18.112 --> 01:21.215
IT'S FROM
A LAW FIRM.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.584
- IT'S NOTHING.
- WHAT IS IT?

01:23.684 --> 01:27.521
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
BEING SUED, ARE YOU?

01:29.623 --> 01:32.526
BY WHO?
MOM?!

01:32.626 --> 01:36.264
( groans )
YOU KNOW THAT'S--
THAT'S ALL SETTLED.

01:36.364 --> 01:39.467
THEN WHO?
IT'S NOT ONE
OF YOUR PATIENTS?

01:40.868 --> 01:43.371
IT IS, ISN'T IT?

01:43.471 --> 01:45.473
YOU KNOW I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.442
- WELL, THEN WHO CAN
YOU TALK ABOUT IT WITH?
- I HAVE A LAWYER.

01:48.542 --> 01:52.213
- YOU CAN'T TALK TO A LAWYER.
- ROSIE, IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

01:53.547 --> 01:56.184
RIGHT.
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS
CONTROL EVERYTHING SO WELL.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.622
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?
I DON'T GET IT!

02:01.722 --> 02:06.327
YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE CONDEMNING YOURSELF
TO A LIFE OF LONELINESS.

02:06.427 --> 02:09.029
AND FOR WHAT, DAD?
FOR PATIENTS WHO SUE YOU

02:09.129 --> 02:10.631
WHEN YOU TRY TO HELP THEM?

02:10.731 --> 02:14.568
I MEAN, IS THIS REALLY HOW YOU
WANTED EVERYTHING TO TURN OUT?

02:16.404 --> 02:18.739
IT'S GONNA BE FINE,
ROSIE, REALLY.

02:18.839 --> 02:22.476
PLEASE!
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT.
YOU'RE JUST MAKING SHIT UP.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.482
- ( sighs )
- NO NO, I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.951
NO MORE HUGS--
NOT UNTIL YOU COME HOME.

02:31.051 --> 02:34.522
ROSIE, YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.226
( whimpers )

02:41.962 --> 02:44.198
YOU DON'T DESERVE IT.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.781
NICE TURTLE.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.388
( theme music playing )

03:30.143 --> 03:32.880
SO I'M SURE THIS WEEK
YOU READ UP ON ME.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.616
YOU MEAN ABOUT
YOUR COMPANY?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.651
I WON'T HOLD IT
AGAINST YOU.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.587
WE'VE GOT A TARGET
ON OUR BACKS.

03:39.687 --> 03:43.056
MOVED OFF THAT BUSINESS
SECTION YOU NEVER READ

03:43.156 --> 03:45.526
INTO THE FRONT SECTION,

03:45.626 --> 03:47.795
ANY DAY NOW THERE'S GOING
TO BE A FEEDING FRENZY.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.532
ACTUALLY I DID READ
A FEW ARTICLES, BUT MOSTLY
ABOUT THE INDUSTRY.

03:51.632 --> 03:55.403
- NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT YOU.
- FINE, FELLOW, FINE.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.007
CONNIE THINKS THIS
REPORTER AT "THE TIMES"
HAS IT IN FOR ME.

04:00.107 --> 04:02.843
- DO YOU THINK SHE'S RIGHT?
- WELL, LIKE YOU SAID,

04:02.943 --> 04:05.178
THE WHOLE INDUSTRY
IS REELING FROM THIS,

04:05.279 --> 04:07.315
BUT FOR SOME REASON

04:07.415 --> 04:11.251
BRENDA STARR OVER THERE HAS
DECIDED TO MAKE ME THE POSTER
CHILD FOR THE SCANDAL.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.754
IT GOT SO BAD THIS WEEK
THAT CONNIE ASKED ME

04:13.854 --> 04:15.923
IF I'D EVER LAID OFF
THE GIRL'S FATHER.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.792
DO YOU AGREE WITH HER
THAT THIS REPORTER IS
OUT TO GET YOU?

04:18.892 --> 04:21.529
THOSE ARTICLES--
THEY'RE NOT BASED ON FACTS.

04:21.629 --> 04:25.132
SHE'S JUST
LISTENING TO SOMEBODY.
I DON'T KNOW WHO,

04:25.232 --> 04:30.070
SOME MALCONTENT WHO HAS
JUST ENOUGH INFORMATION
TO SOUND KNOWLEDGEABLE

04:30.170 --> 04:31.839
AND DO SERIOUS DAMAGE.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.441
SO IF I FOLLOW YOU THEN,

04:33.541 --> 04:36.109
THIS MAY NOT BE
A REPORTER'S VENDETTA,

04:36.209 --> 04:40.614
BUT IT COULD ACTUALLY
BE THE WORK OF SOMEBODY
FROM INSIDE THE COMPANY.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.617
WELL, I DIDN'T
WANT TO THINK THAT,
BUT THE DONALDSONS--

04:43.717 --> 04:45.953
THAT'S THE FAMILY
WITH THE MAJORITY STAKE--

04:46.053 --> 04:47.955
THEY'RE CONVINCED OF IT.

04:48.055 --> 04:51.625
OLD MAN DONALDSON SAID,
"WALTER, WE HAVE A JUDAS
IN OUR MIDST."

04:51.725 --> 04:54.562
THAT MUST BE
PRETTY DISTURBING,

04:54.662 --> 04:58.065
NOT KNOWING WHO TO TRUST
IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.967
WELL, THAT'S BUSINESS.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.603
BUT WHAT'S REALLY
DISTURBING IS FOR
HER TO IMPLY

05:02.703 --> 05:04.872
THAT I WOULD ENDANGER
THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN

05:04.972 --> 05:08.742
JUST TO TURN A PROFIT.
I MEAN, THAT'S COMPLETELY
IRRESPONSIBLE.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.644
I'M A FATHER,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.481
GOT A DAUGHTER
WHO'S PROBABLY READING
ABOUT THIS ONLINE.

05:13.581 --> 05:17.050
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
HOW SHE MIGHT REACT?

05:18.285 --> 05:20.053
NO NO.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.189
SHE KNOWS
WHO HER OLD MAN IS.

05:22.289 --> 05:25.359
BUT I AM WORRIED
THAT THESE ARTICLES

05:25.459 --> 05:27.528
MIGHT BE PUTTING
NATALIE IN JEOPARDY.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.330
- I'M NOT SURE THAT I FOLLOW.
- WELL, GOD FORBID

05:30.431 --> 05:32.232
THEY FIND OUT
SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.334
FOR ALL I KNOW THEY
PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.604
MAYBE SHE'S ALREADY
DISAPPEARED.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.640
MAYBE THEY'RE
STALLING FOR TIME

05:39.740 --> 05:42.910
WHILE HE DECIDES
HOW MUCH RANSOM HE
THINKS HE CAN ASK FOR.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.848
DO YOU THINK
I SOUND CRAZY?

05:47.948 --> 05:51.218
I THINK YOUR ANXIETY MIGHT
BE INFLUENCING YOUR JUDGMENT.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.487
WELL, I'M NOT
THE ONLY ONE.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.990
CONNIE'S ALLERGIES
ARE ACTING UP.
SHE'S LOSING WEIGHT.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.460
OR MAYBE SHE'S
WORRIED FOR YOU.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.896
ME? ABOUT WHAT?
MY JOB?

06:02.996 --> 06:05.799
NO, THAT REPORTER
FROM "THE TIMES" WHO'S
TRYING TO GET ME FIRED,

06:05.899 --> 06:08.702
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE WORRIED.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.672
OR DO I SOUND
CRAZY AGAIN?

06:11.772 --> 06:14.608
ACTUALLY I THINK
YOU SOUND QUITE CONFIDENT

06:14.708 --> 06:17.344
FOR A MAN IN THE MIDST OF A...

06:17.445 --> 06:19.547
WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?
A FEEDING FRENZY?

06:19.647 --> 06:22.015
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S
A REASON FOR THAT--

06:22.115 --> 06:24.151
THE DONALDSONS.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.353
I'VE WORKED FOR THEM
FOR OVER 35 YEARS.

06:26.454 --> 06:29.089
I'M LIKE
A SON TO THEM.

06:36.997 --> 06:40.100
CAN I ASK YOU WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT NOW?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.403
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.674
YOU'RE THE FELLOW
WHO WANTS ME TO SAY
WHATEVER POPS INTO MY HEAD.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.812
I WAS JUST THINKING--
THEY HAD A SON.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.614
JAMES.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.617
WE WERE IN
THE WAR TOGETHER--

06:56.717 --> 06:59.252
ARMY CORPS
OF ENGINEERS.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.990
WE TRIED TO BUILD
BRIDGES OVER THERE,

07:03.090 --> 07:06.259
HELPING PEOPLE WHO
WERE TAKING SHOTS AT US.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.195
WHEN WE GOT
BACK TO THE STATES,

07:08.295 --> 07:10.998
I GOT MY DEGREE
AND HE BROUGHT ME
INTO THE COMPANY.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.568
IF I'D LOOKED OUT FOR HIM
AS MUCH OVER HERE

07:14.668 --> 07:16.704
AS WE DID FOR EACH OTHER
OVER THERE,

07:16.804 --> 07:20.674
- HE MIGHT STILL BE AROUND.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

07:23.076 --> 07:25.579
HE DROVE TOO FAST.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.685
YOU SEE A FAMILY
THROUGH A LOSS LIKE THAT
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA...

07:33.120 --> 07:36.624
AW, THIS CRISIS'LL BLOW OVER.
THEY ALWAYS DO.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.162
I THINK I'VE TALKED ENOUGH.

07:42.262 --> 07:46.133
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING?

07:46.233 --> 07:49.102
WELL, JUST NOW I WAS STRUCK
BY THE WAY YOU SAID THAT THE...

07:49.202 --> 07:52.706
THE CRISIS WOULD BLOW OVER.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.743
IT REMINDED ME
OF WHAT YOU SAID LAST WEEK

07:55.843 --> 07:57.878
AS-- AS YOU WERE LEAVING.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.914
- WHAT DID I SAY?
- I ASKED YOU IF YOU SHOULD
CALL YOUR DOCTOR,

08:01.014 --> 08:03.951
AND YOU SAID
IT WILL GO AWAY.
IT ALWAYS GOES AWAY.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.319
YEAH, LAST WEEK.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.522
LOOK, I THINK
I ALSO SAID I WAS SORRY

08:08.622 --> 08:11.058
IF I GAVE YOU A SCARE.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.661
UH, BUT...

08:13.761 --> 08:16.730
THESE THINGS, THEY LOOK
WORSE THAN THEY ARE.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.932
AND WHAT ARE THEY EXACTLY?

08:19.032 --> 08:21.569
WELL, WHATEVER THEY ARE,
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KILL ME.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.971
THEY'RE INCONVENIENT,
SURE, BUT--

08:24.071 --> 08:25.573
THEY GO AWAY.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.708
AND HAVE YOU EVER
MENTIONED THEM TO ANYONE?

08:27.808 --> 08:30.410
I HAVE A GOLD-PLATED
EXECUTIVE HEALTH PLAN.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.246
I DON'T REALLY NEED IT,
BUT THE COMPANY
INSISTS ON IT.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.949
IF THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG,
THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.886
SO YOU TOLD YOUR DOCTOR
THAT YOU WERE HAVING
TROUBLE SLEEPING,

08:38.986 --> 08:41.154
BUT YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE PANIC ATTACKS.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.758
- THEY'RE NOT PANIC ATTACKS.
- WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

08:46.159 --> 08:49.462
THEY DON'T HAPPEN UNDER
STRESSFUL SITUATIONS.

08:49.563 --> 08:52.600
THEY HAPPEN
AT DINNER SOMETIMES,
OR A MOVIE.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.836
OR, EVIDENTLY,
DURING A THERAPY SESSION.

08:55.936 --> 08:59.807
HAVE YOU HAD ONE
SINCE THEN?

08:59.907 --> 09:03.644
ACTUALLY I HAD ONE THIS WEEK
IN THE ELEVATOR, OF ALL PLACES.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.380
WOULD YOU CARE
TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT?

09:07.480 --> 09:10.851
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
DESCRIBE THE ELEVATOR FOR YOU?

09:10.951 --> 09:14.722
WELL, DID ANYTHING UNUSUAL
HAPPEN THAT MORNING?

09:14.822 --> 09:16.924
NO.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.627
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DESCRIBE THEN...

09:19.727 --> 09:22.663
THE DETAILS OF THAT MORNING
AS YOU REMEMBER?

09:22.763 --> 09:25.032
( groans )
THIS IS LIKE THE GAME
MY WIFE USED TO PLAY

09:25.132 --> 09:26.767
WITH OUR KIDS
AT THE DINNER TABLE.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.737
WE'D ASK THEM
HOW SCHOOL WAS,

09:29.837 --> 09:34.174
THEY'D SAY, "FINE."
ASK THEM WHAT HAPPENED--
"NOTHING."

09:34.274 --> 09:38.111
FINALLY MY WIFE
MADE THEM WALK THROUGH
THE DAY STEP BY STEP.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.580
IS THAT REALLY WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

09:40.681 --> 09:43.016
HUMOR ME.

09:43.116 --> 09:47.554
OKAY,
GOT OUT OF THE TOWN CAR,
WENT INTO THE BUILDING,

09:47.655 --> 09:51.124
MET THE NEW
SECURITY GUARD,

09:51.224 --> 09:54.594
SHOWED HIM MY PASSPORT,
WENT THROUGH THE GATES,

09:54.695 --> 09:58.198
GOT ON THE ELEVATOR,

09:58.298 --> 10:02.135
MY HEART STARTED RACING,
MY THROAT CLOSED UP,

10:02.235 --> 10:06.339
ELEVATOR DOORS OPENED,
WENT INTO MY OFFICE.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.742
THIS IS ABOUT THE TIME

10:08.842 --> 10:11.845
THAT NATALIE
WOULD USUALLY SAY,
"CAN I BE EXCUSED NOW?"

10:11.945 --> 10:14.414
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU FIND
THIS EXERCISE POINTLESS?

10:14.514 --> 10:17.317
I DON'T MEAN TO BE
A DOUBTING THOMAS,
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING

10:17.417 --> 10:19.987
THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED
A PANIC ATTACK, DO YOU?

10:21.655 --> 10:24.291
YOU SAID THERE WAS
A NEW SECURITY GUARD.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.593
YEAH, A KID.
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

10:26.694 --> 10:29.162
ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THAT?

10:29.262 --> 10:32.833
DID IT UPSET YOU, MAYBE,
THAT YOU HAD TO SHOW HIM
YOUR I.D.?

10:32.933 --> 10:35.035
PFFFT, NO.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.871
I KNEW BOB
FOR OVER 30 YEARS

10:37.971 --> 10:41.441
AND I ALWAYS MADE A POINT
OF SHOWING HIM MY I.D.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.011
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO BOB?

10:44.111 --> 10:46.613
HE DIED,
ACCORDING TO THE KID.

10:46.714 --> 10:49.783
UH, DROPPED DEAD
OF HEART FAILURE.

10:51.018 --> 10:54.722
- DISAPPEARED.
- WERE YOU AND BOB CLOSE?

10:54.822 --> 10:56.890
I'D NOD TO HIM
IN THE MORNING.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.160
HE'D SAY, "HEY, MR. B,
HOW ABOUT THOSE KNICKS?"

11:00.260 --> 11:02.529
I'D SAY, "THEY'RE BREAKING
MY HEART, BOB."

11:02.629 --> 11:05.966
AND JUST SAME CONVERSATION
FOR 30 YEARS.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.036
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU TWO
HAD A MORNING RITUAL.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.272
- DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU MISS HIM?
- BOB?!

11:12.372 --> 11:16.176
NO, PAUL,
I DON'T MISS BOB.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.980
I-- I ENJOYED OUR BANTER

11:20.080 --> 11:22.349
AND I FEEL SORRY
FOR HIS FAMILY, BUT...

11:24.017 --> 11:26.019
HE MEANT NOTHING TO ME.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.488
I JUST WONDER IF THERE
MIGHT BE SOME CONNECTION

11:28.588 --> 11:30.623
BETWEEN BOB'S DEATH AND--

11:30.724 --> 11:32.760
YOUR ATTACK IN THE ELEVATOR,
THAT'S ALL.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.528
I THINK YOU'RE GRASPING
FOR STRAWS THERE, FELLA.

11:35.628 --> 11:38.065
OKAY.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.239
WHERE DID YOU
GO TO SCHOOL?

11:46.339 --> 11:49.743
HERE-- IN THE CITY.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.447
ARE YOU WORRIED I'M NOT
QUALIFIED TO TREAT YOU?

11:57.017 --> 11:59.419
IT WAS JUST A QUESTION.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.924
ANYWAY,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.326
LIKE I SAID, I'VE HAD
THESE SINCE I WAS A KID.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.428
I'M USED TO THEM.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.765
FROM WHEN YOU WERE A KID?
REALLY?

12:11.865 --> 12:14.768
OFF AND ON.

12:14.868 --> 12:19.239
WELL, DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW OLD YOU WERE WHEN YOU
EXPERIENCED YOUR FIRST ONE?

12:19.339 --> 12:23.043
- FOUR OR FIVE, I GUESS.
- FOUR OR FIVE, THAT SEEMS
VERY YOUNG.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.279
NO, RIGHT...

12:26.379 --> 12:30.784
SIX, I HAD TO BE SIX.
I WAS ALREADY SLEEPING
IN MY BROTHER'S ROOM.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.955
WERE YOU CLOSE
WITH YOUR BROTHER?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.224
HE DIED
WHEN I WAS A BOY.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.932
HE DROWNED.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.938
UH-- HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

12:53.473 --> 12:56.276
OH, WELL, THIS WAS
IN RURAL PENNSYLVANIA.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.612
IT WAS AN OLD
LIMESTONE QUARRY LAKE.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.315
A SWIMMING HOLE REALLY.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.385
40' CLIFFS.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.988
IT WAS A HOT SUMMER NIGHT.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.390
AND WHAT AGE WAS HE?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.292
16.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.627
GETTING READY TO GO
TO COLLEGE IN THE FALL--

13:14.727 --> 13:16.696
YALE.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.598
HE SEEMED
KINDA YOUNG FOR THAT,

13:18.698 --> 13:20.267
BUT HE SKIPPED
A FEW GRADES.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.303
ALL THE BRIGHTEST KIDS DID
BACK THEN.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.606
BUT OF ALL OF THEM,
TOMMY WAS THE BRIGHTEST.

13:26.706 --> 13:29.276
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.945
A REAL GOLDEN BOY--
VALEDICTORIAN,

13:32.045 --> 13:34.814
FULL SCHOLARSHIP.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.885
TOMMY WALKED ON WATER.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.325
HOW WAS IT FOR YOU WHEN HE...

13:45.425 --> 13:47.194
WHEN HE DIED?

13:47.294 --> 13:50.763
FINE.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.700
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I REALLY
KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON,
I WAS SO YOUNG.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.935
MM-HMM.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.704
AND YOUR PARENTS...

13:57.804 --> 14:00.407
HOW DID THEY--
HOW DID THEY GRIEVE?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.242
THEY DIDN'T.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.744
WELL, OF COURSE THEY DID.
THEY HAD TO,

14:04.844 --> 14:08.148
BUT THEY
SHIELDED ME FROM THAT.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.352
BUT YOU KNEW SOMETHING
WAS GOING ON?

14:12.452 --> 14:16.189
ALL I KNOW IS THAT ONE DAY
TOMMY JUST WASN'T THERE.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.792
AND I THINK I STAYED
WITH THE NEIGHBORS
FOR A FEW NIGHTS.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.828
AND THEN I WENT HOME.

14:21.929 --> 14:25.332
MY DAD WAS SITTING ON THE PORCH,
DRINKING HIS LAGER,
WAITING FOR ME.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.501
HE WALKED ME UP
TO MY BROTHER'S ROOM.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.238
ALL HIS STUFF
WAS STILL THERE.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.706
NOTHING CHANGED.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.543
MY FATHER SAID,
"THIS IS YOURS NOW.

14:36.643 --> 14:41.081
I JUST TOLD YOUR MOTHER
NOW I KNOW WHY WE HAD YOU."

14:42.349 --> 14:45.118
THEN HE TURNS AROUND
AND LEAVES ME THERE.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.588
OR AT LEAST THAT'S
HOW I REMEMBER IT.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.628
IT'S A VERY--
THAT'S A VERY
POWERFUL MEMORY.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.565
WELL, LIKE
I SAID, I WAS YOUNG.
I MIGHT HAVE IT WRONG.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.669
AND WHEN YOU
TELL IT NOW TO ME,

15:02.769 --> 15:05.605
WHAT EMOTIONS DOES IT
BRING UP FOR YOU?

15:07.707 --> 15:09.476
I JUST FEEL SORRY
FOR THE OLD MAN.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.378
TOMMY WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.447
AND YOUR MOTHER?
HOW DID SHE REACT?

15:17.050 --> 15:19.119
HER HAIR TURNED WHITE.

15:19.219 --> 15:22.289
SHE HAD THIS GORGEOUS
AUBURN HAIR.

15:22.389 --> 15:27.127
AND THEN OVERNIGHT
SHE CHANGED INTO AN OLD WOMAN.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.464
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
A CHANGELING FOR A WHILE.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.901
THAT MY REAL MOTHER
WAS TRAPPED SOMEWHERE

15:35.002 --> 15:37.237
FAR AWAY.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.276
WALTER, WHAT--

15:43.376 --> 15:45.945
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT--

15:46.046 --> 15:49.282
DESCRIBING, IT'S--

15:50.150 --> 15:52.952
( sighs )
IT'S SIGNIFICANT.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.523
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
HARD FOR YOU

15:56.623 --> 15:59.792
TO COPE WITH
THE LOSS OF YOUR BROTHER
AND YOUR PARENTS' GRIEF.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.962
KIDS ARE RESILIENT.
THEY SURVIVE.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.166
BUT YOU BEGAN TO HAVE
THESE ATTACKS

16:06.266 --> 16:08.801
AFTER YOU WERE SLEEPING
IN TOMMY'S ROOM.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.171
YEAH, I DID.
SO-- SO WHAT?

16:13.540 --> 16:16.643
LIKE I SAID, THEY ONLY OCCURRED
WHILE I WAS SLEEPING.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.112
AND WHAT WERE THEY LIKE
BACK THEN?

16:19.212 --> 16:21.814
I'D WAKE UP SWEATING
AND SHAKING.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.283
DID YOU EVER
TELL YOUR PARENTS?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.018
NO, THEY HAD ENOUGH
ON THEIR MINDS.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.287
AND THESE PANIC ATTACKS,
JUST LIKE NOW,

16:27.387 --> 16:30.023
- THEY WOULD GO AWAY.
- THERE YOU GO AGAIN
WITH THIS PANIC.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.524
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN LISTENING?

16:33.026 --> 16:36.263
HOW COULD THEY BE PANIC ATTACKS?
THEY HAPPENED WHEN I WAS ASLEEP.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.331
HOW STRESSED OUT
COULD I HAVE BEEN?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.300
AS A CHILD WHOSE BROTHER
HAD JUST VANISHED,

16:40.400 --> 16:42.602
AND WHOSE PARENTS
OFFERED NO EXPLANATION,

16:42.702 --> 16:45.105
I THINK, WALTER, YOU COULD HAVE
BEEN VERY STRESSED OUT

16:45.205 --> 16:48.441
EVEN IN YOUR DREAMS.
ESPECIALLY IN YOUR DREAMS.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.412
YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOUR PARENTS

16:52.512 --> 16:56.683
PLACED A HEAVY BURDEN ON YOU
AFTER TOMMY DIED.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.419
DID YOU EVER FEEL THAT
THEY WANTED YOU TO FULFILL
HIS POTENTIAL?

16:59.519 --> 17:03.323
OHHH, NOBODY COULD EVER
FULFILL TOMMY'S POTENTIAL.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.792
BUT I TRIED.
I DID TRY.

17:05.892 --> 17:10.263
YET YOU ARE A VERY
SUCCESSFUL MAN.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.465
WELL, I'M R.O.T.C.
FROM PENN STATE.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.135
TOMMY HAD AN IVY LEAGUE
SCHOLARSHIP.

17:15.235 --> 17:18.205
TOMMY WOULD HAVE
CURED CANCER.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.542
DO YOU THINK
ABOUT TOMMY A LOT?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.511
NO.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.579
BUT ACTUALLY, I'VE...

17:26.679 --> 17:30.717
BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT
IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE
FOR MY FOLKS

17:30.817 --> 17:33.052
WHEN I WAS IN VIETNAM.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.989
THEY'D ALREADY LOST ONE
AND THEIR ONLY SPARE WAS
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.359
I MUST HAVE PUT THEM
THROUGH HELL.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.794
DID THEY EVER SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU ABOUT THAT?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.531
NO, LIKE I SAID,
THEY...

17:44.631 --> 17:46.899
UH, THEY DIDN'T TALK A LOT
ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.836
HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR DAUGHTER
HOW WORRIED YOU ARE FOR HER?

17:51.003 --> 17:52.539
WHERE'S THAT COMING FROM?

17:52.639 --> 17:56.609
WELL, NATALIE IS NOW ALSO
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.249
DO YOU RECALL
THE WORD YOU USED

18:02.349 --> 18:04.817
WHEN YOU WERE DESCRIBING
TOMMY'S DEATH?

18:04.917 --> 18:07.820
NO, BUT I'M SURE
YOU DO.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.856
YOU SAID HE DISAPPEARED.

18:09.956 --> 18:13.160
IT'S THE SAME WORD YOU USED
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU FEAR
MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO NATALIE.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.062
AND ALSO
WHAT HAPPENED TO BOB.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.831
DON'T READ
TOO FAR INTO THIS.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.202
THAT'S A STRANGE THING
TO SAY TO A THERAPIST.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.936
OH, COME ON.
I'M JOKING.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.806
WERE YOU?
REALLY?

18:28.275 --> 18:30.042
IT SEEMS TO ME,
THIS WHOLE SESSION, WALT,

18:30.143 --> 18:33.079
ANY TIME I'VE TRIED
TO READ INTO THINGS,

18:33.180 --> 18:35.215
OR SUGGEST ANOTHER WAY
OF LOOKING AT A PROBLEM,

18:35.315 --> 18:37.049
YOU'VE SHUT ME DOWN.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.420
IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST THAT IF
YOU'RE WRONG, YOU'RE WRONG.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.390
- AM I SUPPOSED TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS?
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

18:43.490 --> 18:47.494
BUT I'M SUPPOSED TO PAY
ATTENTION TO YOURS AND YOU'VE
GIVEN ME THE STRONG SENSE,

18:47.594 --> 18:50.497
I HAVE TO SAY,
THAT IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR

18:50.597 --> 18:53.566
YOU MIGHT VERY WELL JUST
WALK OUT OF THE ROOM.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.203
YOU MEAN FIRE YOU.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.505
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG
ABOUT THAT TOO.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.774
LOOK, IF YOU THINK I NEED
TO HEAR SOMETHING

19:01.874 --> 19:03.510
JUST COME ON OUT
AND SAY IT.

19:03.610 --> 19:07.079
I'M A BIG BOY.
YOU THINK BOB THE SECURITY GUARD
IS MY ROSEBUD,

19:07.180 --> 19:09.716
TELL ME HOW.

19:09.816 --> 19:14.754
ACTUALLY I THINK THIS
PRECEDES BOB AND NATALIE.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.590
GO ON.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.595
( clears throat )

19:24.731 --> 19:27.200
I DON'T THINK THAT
YOU TRUST THAT

19:27.300 --> 19:30.169
PEOPLE WHO LEAVE YOU
WILL EVER COME BACK.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.642
YOUR BROTHER NEVER RETURNED.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.478
YOUR MOTHER LOOKING LIKE
A DIFFERENT PERSON.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.281
YOUR FATHER
WAS NEVER THE SAME.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.950
AND NOBODY MADE SENSE
OF IT ALL FOR YOU

19:44.050 --> 19:45.652
AS A KID.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.890
PERHAPS YOU STILL FEAR
THAT IF SOMEONE

19:50.990 --> 19:53.293
DISAPPEARS,

19:53.393 --> 19:56.128
EVEN MOMENTARILY--
WHETHER THEY'RE OVERSEAS

19:56.229 --> 19:57.897
OR JUST OUT OF TOUCH
FOR A FEW DAYS--

19:57.997 --> 20:00.800
THAT SOMETHING HORRIBLE
MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.672
PERHAPS IN CERTAIN
SITUATIONS, WALTER,
YOU EXPERIENCE

20:05.772 --> 20:09.676
A DISPROPORTIONATELY
STRESSFUL RESPONSE.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.550
SO IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOU,

20:17.650 --> 20:20.553
ALL THIS STARTED WHEN
MY DAUGHTER LEFT FOR RWANDA.

20:20.653 --> 20:24.357
IT'S AN OVERREACTION--
LIKE MY WIFE'S ALLERGIES.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.760
DOES THAT
MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

20:29.929 --> 20:32.899
DO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF
PSYCHOLOGICAL ANTIHISTAMINE?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.634
DO YOU MEAN A PRESCRIPTION?

20:36.603 --> 20:38.971
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE PILLS.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.442
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE THAT WAS
BECAUSE MY DOCTOR DIDN'T
HAVE YOUR DIAGNOSIS.

20:42.542 --> 20:46.012
THERE IS MEDICATION
FOR PANIC ATTACKS, WALTER.

20:49.015 --> 20:52.018
BUT I THINK IT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT

20:52.118 --> 20:55.087
THAT WE CONTINUE THE WORK THAT
WE'RE BEGINNING TO DO HERE.

20:55.187 --> 20:58.425
WELL, CALL MY DOCTOR.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.861
TELL HIM WHAT YOU THINK.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.596
I'LL DO THAT.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.866
GOOD. THANKS,
I APPRECIATE IT.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.471
- OUR TIME'S UP, ISN'T IT?
- YES, IT IS.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.144
OH, YOU CAN
PAY ME AT THE END
OF THE MONTH, IF YOU--

21:18.244 --> 21:20.747
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
ONE THING I LEARNED
FROM MY FATHER,

21:20.847 --> 21:24.784
PAY AS YOU GO.
IT'S CLEANER THAT WAY.

21:26.453 --> 21:30.390
- MAYBE THE MEDICATION
WILL HELP.
- THANK YOU.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.959
THANK YOU.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.961
- GOODBYE.
- GOODBYE, WALTER.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.876
( exhales )

21:56.182 --> 21:58.518
( theme music playing )
