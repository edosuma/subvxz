WOMAN:
 Previously on East Los High:

00:01.635 --> 00:04.505
JOCELYN:
 I've never done
anything like that.

00:04.571 --> 00:06.673
With a girl.
But it felt good, didn't it?

00:06.740 --> 00:10.110
I want us to always be
best friends. Promise me, right?

00:10.177 --> 00:12.179
What's up, sis?
Nicholas!

00:12.246 --> 00:14.281
You've changed.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.217
Hey, what's going on?

00:17.284 --> 00:19.386
I swear, you're the only girl
getting a taste of this.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.721
June's a virgin.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.489
Why are you still with her?
You're my girl.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.424
You're my man.
And you're my lady.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.760
( speaking in Spanish )

00:27.027 --> 00:28.595
CECI:
 You have no discipline,

00:28.662 --> 00:31.031
no technique,
and absolutely no game.

00:31.098 --> 00:32.766
Thanks for telling us
how shitty we are.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.768
Any more trouble from you,
and you're out of here.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.671
Do you understand?
Do you?

00:39.239 --> 00:41.708
Where the hell
is everybody?

00:41.775 --> 00:45.612
I'm gonna go
Ceci Camayo on their asses.

00:45.679 --> 00:49.383
Oh, shit, I forgot.
Life Skills class.

00:49.449 --> 00:54.521
VANESSA:
Isn't it just drug addicts
and old gay guys who get HIV?

00:54.588 --> 00:58.592
No. All of you
are at risk.

00:58.659 --> 01:03.030
Almost 40% of all new
HIV infections in the U.S.

01:03.096 --> 01:07.100
are young people
between 13 and 29.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.102
Did that answer
your question?

01:11.238 --> 01:13.740
"Me and my boyfriend don't like
to plan when we do it,

01:14.007 --> 01:17.010
so we get busy
without condoms."

01:17.077 --> 01:18.579
And guess what,

01:18.645 --> 01:21.582
when I got HIV,
I had to start planning

01:21.648 --> 01:24.151
everything in my life
to stay healthy.

01:24.218 --> 01:28.288
I'm talking meds, meals,
workouts, sleep.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.390
So if you're gonna
plan one thing,

01:30.457 --> 01:32.259
plan to wear a condom.

01:34.394 --> 01:36.597
This is just nasty.
I'm not reading this one.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.466
( class snickers )

01:39.533 --> 01:41.468
"Why should I get tested?

01:41.535 --> 01:42.769
My boyfriend's penis
looks good."

01:43.036 --> 01:44.171
( class laughs )

01:44.238 --> 01:46.139
Okay, I hate to break it
to you guys,

01:46.206 --> 01:49.443
but cute dicks
can spread infection too, okay?

01:49.509 --> 01:53.280
So get tested if you've ever
had sex without a condom.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.182
Vanessa?

01:56.416 --> 01:58.118
Ceci.

01:59.386 --> 02:00.787
What are you doing here?

02:01.054 --> 02:04.157
Talking to the students
about safe sex.

02:04.224 --> 02:07.160
Why are you in school?
So you can drop out again?

02:07.227 --> 02:09.096
I'm the Bomb Squad's
new coach.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.565
You? You have
the IQ of a churro.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.268
Why would they ask you
instead of me?

02:14.334 --> 02:15.702
'Cause I got the moves.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.138
Only moves you got
got you pregnant.

02:18.205 --> 02:21.341
CLASSMATES:
Ooh.

02:21.408 --> 02:22.676
There's a lot
I could say right now,

02:22.743 --> 02:24.244
but I'm a paid educator.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.214
Paid?
Mm-hm.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.783
Ms. Alvarez!

02:30.050 --> 02:32.552
Why didn't you ask me
to be the coach?

02:32.619 --> 02:34.688
I'm the better dancer.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.557
You stole that move
from me!

02:37.624 --> 02:40.127
Ms. A hired me
because I'm not a rude bitch.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.496
No, just a dumb one.
MS. ALVAREZ: Stop it!

02:42.562 --> 02:45.465
May I remind you both you're not
in high school anymore?

02:45.532 --> 02:48.435
You made
a horrible mistake, Ms. A,

02:48.502 --> 02:50.203
but here's
how you fix it:

02:50.270 --> 02:52.506
You fire her
and you hire me.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.308
Then I fire
every single one

02:54.374 --> 02:57.577
of those skonka losers,
and we start all over again.

02:57.644 --> 03:00.414
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.583
CECI:
 You're all fired.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.585
What?
You can't do that!

03:05.652 --> 03:07.254
Yeah, who do you think
you are?

03:07.321 --> 03:09.089
The only person who wants
to win around here.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.425
I'm not going down
with you losers.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.493
So get your shit
and get outta here--

03:13.560 --> 03:15.395
that is, if you think
you can manage that move.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.631
Let's go.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.433
See you at tryouts.
Don't hold your breath.

03:19.499 --> 03:20.701
CECI:
Oh, I'm not.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.469
Good luck
finding another Tiffany.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.037
Not looking.
Not worried.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.173
FILIBERTA:
You should be.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.175
Bye, bitches.

Here you go.
WOMAN: Gracias, mija.

04:11.518 --> 04:14.621
You let me know if you
need anything, okay?

04:17.257 --> 04:20.127
Wow, Zac.
Cool sketch.

04:20.193 --> 04:22.562
You're so talented.
What do you want?

04:22.629 --> 04:24.564
Okay, how many girls
has Diego been with before me?

04:24.631 --> 04:26.366
Why don't you just
ask him yourself?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.668
I can't talk to Diego
like I talk to you.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.238
Diego's my boyfriend,
and you're my friend.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.407
Why do I always end up
in the friend zone?

04:33.473 --> 04:35.575
Come on, just tell me.

04:35.642 --> 04:38.145
Do you think I'm the one,
or am I just another one

04:38.211 --> 04:39.579
of all the ones
he's been with before me?

04:39.646 --> 04:42.416
Gina, I don't speak girl.

04:42.482 --> 04:46.620
Do you think what Diego and I
have is different?

04:46.686 --> 04:48.321
I think he's
seriously into you.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.757
He invited you to his parents'
anniversary dinner,

04:51.024 --> 04:53.059
and not me,
so you tell me.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.362

thank you!

04:56.530 --> 04:57.731
Hey, babe.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.567
That for me?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.269
No, it's for my Sweet G.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.537
Will you go
to Homecoming with me?

05:03.603 --> 05:05.005
Hell, yeah.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.341
Is everybody on break?

05:08.408 --> 05:10.310
I just got asked
to Homecoming.

05:10.377 --> 05:13.146
But don't worry,
Zac's gonna cover for me.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.615
What? How do you know
I'm not going?

05:15.682 --> 05:18.051
Why don't you both go?

05:18.118 --> 05:19.319
I'll cover for you.

05:21.354 --> 05:24.224
Yeah, well, Maya's not
covering for you right now,

05:24.291 --> 05:27.327

05:27.394 --> 05:29.196
Dude, you've never been
to a school dance.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.565
You always say
you're too cool for that.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.515
Can I have one?
No!

05:48.582 --> 05:50.317
I didn't make 'em
for you.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.619
Why won't you just tell me
who your mystery boyfriend is?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.554
Because you're
a gossip queen.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.289
Now, hurry up,
we're late.

Shh.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.083
Will you go
to Homecoming?

06:23.149 --> 06:24.618
What the hell?
Get outta my truck.

06:24.684 --> 06:27.220
Why?
What's wrong?

06:28.355 --> 06:30.223
What if Gina sees this?

06:30.290 --> 06:32.259
Then she'll break up with you,
and we'll be together.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.027
I told you
I'd do it my way.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.029
Your way's
taking too long.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.364
You just blew it, girl.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.065
Now for sure
I'm taking Gina.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.467
You dick.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.235
It was always
gonna be Gina, wasn't it?

06:42.302 --> 06:45.205
Shh! Tiff, what
you and me got--

06:45.272 --> 06:47.374
Is nothing!
We're done.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.379
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.048
Let's see how long
you can go without having sex.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.716
Me? You!

06:56.783 --> 06:59.152
Come on, Tiff,
I liked your brownies.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.021
Enjoy them, because
it's the last thing of mine

07:01.087 --> 07:02.389
you're ever gonna eat.

Unh!
All right.

07:13.477 --> 07:15.579
Nice.

07:15.646 --> 07:17.615
Sweet tracks, Nick.

07:17.681 --> 07:19.183
There's nice fusion
on this.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.885
That's
my Mexi-rican vibe.

07:20.951 --> 07:22.853
You're looking at the next
Pit Bull, only younger.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.055
And with a lot more hair.

07:24.121 --> 07:26.957
Yeah, you got
a little swag.

07:27.024 --> 07:31.662
Listen, how'd you like
an internship at R & R Music?

07:31.729 --> 07:33.597
No shit.
When do I start?

07:33.664 --> 07:35.232
( chuckles ):
Slow your roll, bro.

07:35.499 --> 07:38.035
I said internship, which means
you'll be working for free.

07:38.102 --> 07:40.604
Free?
But you stay in line,

07:40.671 --> 07:42.106
you pay your dues,

07:42.173 --> 07:44.708
I can hook you up with
some big dogs in the industry.

07:44.775 --> 07:46.010
Yeah? For what
you're paying me,

07:46.077 --> 07:47.745
there better be
some Great Danes.

Hey, I'll do whatever it takes
to make it right with you.

07:56.687 --> 07:57.922
I like that.
For real.

07:57.988 --> 07:59.657
I'm gonna hold you to it.

08:11.669 --> 08:14.004
Yo, yo, yo,
work of art here.

08:14.071 --> 08:16.140
I hate Homecoming.

08:16.207 --> 08:18.509
Well, don't take it out
on my banner.

08:20.544 --> 08:21.712
Wait.

08:21.779 --> 08:25.549
You're new, right?
Yeah.

08:25.616 --> 08:27.918
It's always like that when
you come into a new school.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.220

08:29.487 --> 08:31.222
I should have never left
Yuma High.

08:31.489 --> 08:33.023
I was class secretary,

08:33.090 --> 08:36.894
I was Miss Teen Yuma,
and dance captain.

08:36.961 --> 08:39.029
Yeah, I heard you're
a pretty good dancer.

08:39.096 --> 08:40.764
Yeah? Who said that?

08:40.831 --> 08:43.267
Gina. She's dating
my boy, Diego.

08:43.534 --> 08:45.536
You're friends
with Diego?

08:45.603 --> 08:46.871
Yeah. You know him?

08:46.937 --> 08:48.506
I've seen him around.

08:50.241 --> 08:53.844
So you're an artist?

08:57.515 --> 08:59.250
You're driving me crazy.
What are you doing?

08:59.517 --> 09:02.720
Just because I'm a virgin
doesn't mean we can't have fun.

09:02.786 --> 09:04.922
Good, 'cause Starfighter's
ready to meet you.

09:04.989 --> 09:06.790
You have a name
for your penis?

09:06.857 --> 09:08.092
He's yours, too.
Come on, say "Hi."

09:08.159 --> 09:09.827
Oh, not here.

09:09.894 --> 09:11.495
At least shake hands.
( unzips zipper )

09:11.562 --> 09:13.697

Oh, my God.

09:13.764 --> 09:15.566
Okay, then when?

09:17.735 --> 09:19.036
Okay, well,
I've been thinking.

09:19.103 --> 09:20.604
The dance is coming up,

09:20.671 --> 09:24.575
and I'm making
this really sexy dress.

09:24.642 --> 09:27.144
It's black, short,

09:27.211 --> 09:29.246
and tight
in all the right places.

09:29.513 --> 09:31.482
Stop. Starfighter's
gonna blast off.

09:31.549 --> 09:33.884
I can see that.

09:33.951 --> 09:36.153
First time is not
going to be in your truck.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.989
It's gonna be indoors,

09:39.056 --> 09:42.193
in a bed,
with flowers

09:42.259 --> 09:43.761
and scented candles,

09:43.827 --> 09:45.129
and Drake playing--

09:45.196 --> 09:46.997
Damn, girl, you got
more rules than the Army.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.899
Well, that's the way
it's gonna be.

09:48.966 --> 09:50.534
Right.

09:50.601 --> 09:53.103
( zips up zipper )
( class bell rings )

09:53.170 --> 09:54.872
( sighs )

09:54.939 --> 09:56.807
Hi.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.077
Um, so I heard
you were a DJ.

10:00.144 --> 10:01.512
Are you any good?

10:01.579 --> 10:04.782
I just got an internship
at R & R Records.

10:04.848 --> 10:05.983
So you tell me.

10:06.050 --> 10:08.219
Well, I'm Fili.

10:08.485 --> 10:09.887
Nick.

10:09.954 --> 10:12.122
And I'm on the music committee
for Homecoming.

10:12.189 --> 10:13.857
Um, we really need
a DJ.

10:13.924 --> 10:15.826
Cool, what's it pay?

10:15.893 --> 10:18.162
Um, nothing.

10:18.229 --> 10:21.699
Damn, do I got an "I'll work
for free" sign on my forehead?

10:21.765 --> 10:22.900
Well, you get
two free tickets,

10:22.967 --> 10:25.569
and I'm available.

10:25.636 --> 10:27.137
You're still available.

10:27.204 --> 10:29.206
I already got somebody
in mind.

10:30.808 --> 10:33.210
Wait, so does that mean
you'll do it?

10:33.277 --> 10:35.613
Yes!

10:35.679 --> 10:38.849
I can't believe it.
Thank you.

10:40.784 --> 10:42.086
What?

10:42.152 --> 10:44.788
Wow,
I just got invited

10:44.855 --> 10:47.057
to this year's
Young Voice Poetry Slam.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.993
What?
That's amazing!

10:49.059 --> 10:50.928
Yeah.
Can I come?

10:50.995 --> 10:52.630
Sure.

10:54.198 --> 10:57.601
Um, full disclosure...

10:57.668 --> 11:00.704
The poetry slam is
the same night as the dance.

11:00.771 --> 11:04.041
So? I don't care
about Homecoming.

11:04.108 --> 11:05.242
Cool.

11:05.509 --> 11:07.745
And there's
a $500 prize.

11:07.811 --> 11:10.214
Shopping spree!
( laughs )

11:10.481 --> 11:13.250
What are you gonna buy me?
Well, first, I gotta win.

11:13.517 --> 11:15.019
Which you will.

11:15.085 --> 11:18.188
And second,
if I do win,

11:18.255 --> 11:20.257
the money's going
to Amber's fund.

11:20.524 --> 11:22.259
Amber?

11:22.526 --> 11:25.729
You know that loca's
probably partying in T.J.

11:25.796 --> 11:27.831
Okay.

11:27.898 --> 11:29.767
It's a date.

11:34.872 --> 11:37.141
( bell rings )

11:37.207 --> 11:39.710
Yo, Camila!
Hold up.

11:41.545 --> 11:44.248
Hey, wanna come
to Homecoming with me?

11:44.515 --> 11:47.885
Sorry, I got plans.
You got a date?

11:47.951 --> 11:50.688
What you think?
You're hot, I get it.

11:50.754 --> 11:53.590
But you're gonna regret
turning me down when I'm famous.

11:53.657 --> 11:55.559
I'm working
at R & R Records.

11:55.626 --> 11:58.095
Wretched and raggedy?
Never heard of them.

11:58.162 --> 12:01.732
R & R, come on.
Remy Ramirez's company.

12:01.799 --> 12:03.634
He's the hottest
producer in town.

12:03.701 --> 12:05.102
I thought
that was Pharrell.

12:05.169 --> 12:07.838
Okay, second hottest.

12:07.905 --> 12:10.174
Hey, you watch,

12:10.240 --> 12:12.643
Remy's
gonna change my life.

12:15.646 --> 12:18.682
( hop hop theme playing )

12:18.749 --> 12:22.019
Don't forget Bomb Squad tryouts
are this afternoon.

12:22.086 --> 12:23.887
What a joke.

12:23.954 --> 12:26.023
You're not gonna find
my ass there.

12:26.090 --> 12:28.592
Yeah! I'm not taking orders
from that ho.

12:28.659 --> 12:30.928
Yeah.

12:30.994 --> 12:33.897
Oh, yeah,
I hate that ho, too.

12:33.964 --> 12:37.067
I can't wait to see Ceci's face
when no one shows up.

12:39.036 --> 12:41.271
What are you doing here?

12:41.538 --> 12:43.974
What? I already
got a uniform.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.743
What's your excuse?

12:45.809 --> 12:48.946
I'm just checkin' it out.
Me too.

12:49.012 --> 12:52.249
CECI ( clapping ):
All right, ladies,
let's get started.

12:52.516 --> 12:53.851
Come on, line up.

12:56.153 --> 12:58.689
Okay,
this new Bomb Squad

12:58.756 --> 13:01.925
is going to do what I say,
when I say it.

13:01.992 --> 13:03.260
So when I say, "Jump,"

13:03.527 --> 13:05.729
you all say,
"From what rooftop?"

13:05.796 --> 13:08.699
If anybody has a problem
with that-- out.

13:11.702 --> 13:14.505
Okay, we're gonna
break up into groups.

13:14.571 --> 13:15.973
So go ahead
and go off.

13:16.039 --> 13:18.008
Group one, you're out first.
Let's go!

13:19.643 --> 13:22.613
( Latin pop music playing
over speakers )

14:02.553 --> 14:04.121
Um, okay. Thank you.
( music stops )

14:04.188 --> 14:06.590
Hey, what's your name?
Jasmine.

14:06.657 --> 14:08.058
Thank you, Jasmine.
Go ahead and go back.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.560
Thanks.
Thank you, ladies.

14:09.626 --> 14:11.562
Camila, I don't know
what that was.

14:11.628 --> 14:13.931
It was not hip hop,
it was something like hip flop.

14:13.997 --> 14:16.633
( group laughs )
Come on over to the front.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.101
Don't be scared.

14:18.168 --> 14:20.137
I want you to take it
from the top.

14:20.204 --> 14:21.705
With counts.

14:21.772 --> 14:24.708
Five, six, seven, eight.

14:24.775 --> 14:28.078
One, two, three,
four, five--

14:28.145 --> 14:29.580
Uh-uh, stop.

14:29.646 --> 14:30.814
So you think
you can dance?

14:30.881 --> 14:32.115
Well, you can't.

14:32.182 --> 14:34.151
Stupid.
CECI: Do it again!

14:34.218 --> 14:37.154
Five, six, seven, eight!
GIRL: Come on, girl.

14:37.221 --> 14:40.157
One, two, three, four,

14:40.224 --> 14:42.226
five, six--

14:42.493 --> 14:44.628
Girl, your twerk
does not work.

14:44.695 --> 14:46.964
( class groans )
CECI: Again!

14:47.030 --> 14:50.734
Five, six, seven, eight!

14:50.801 --> 14:53.637
One, two, three, four--
GIRL: Come on, Camila!

14:55.138 --> 14:57.574
No. I quit.

14:57.641 --> 15:01.078
You quit?
Girl, you're cut.

15:01.144 --> 15:03.814
Fili!
You're up next!

15:03.881 --> 15:05.749
Come on, don't keep me waiting!
Let's go!

15:05.816 --> 15:08.552
Five, six, seven, eight!

15:08.619 --> 15:11.054
One, two, three, four,

15:11.121 --> 15:13.690
five, six, seven, eight!

15:13.757 --> 15:15.859
( dramatic theme playing )

15:25.168 --> 15:27.704
So you sure
Diego's the one?

15:27.771 --> 15:29.673
Yeah.

15:29.740 --> 15:31.174
I love him.

15:31.241 --> 15:33.277
Look, he even
baked me some brownies.

15:33.510 --> 15:34.945
( chuckles )

15:35.012 --> 15:37.614
You know you can still
love him and wait.

15:37.681 --> 15:39.216
I know.

15:39.483 --> 15:41.518
But I don't want to.

15:41.585 --> 15:44.688
I already went down to
the clinic and got on the pill.

15:44.755 --> 15:46.590
Is that what you use?

15:48.225 --> 15:49.560
Kinda.

15:49.626 --> 15:51.495
Kinda?

15:51.562 --> 15:53.130
Are you crazy?
You wanna end up like mom?

15:53.196 --> 15:55.032
( scoffs ):
Hell, no.

15:55.098 --> 15:56.700
Cami...

15:56.767 --> 15:58.235
What was
your first time like?

16:00.737 --> 16:02.172
I don't remember.

16:02.239 --> 16:03.840
Yeah, right.

16:03.907 --> 16:06.843
Losing your virginity
is a big deal.

16:06.910 --> 16:09.046
Tell me,
were you scared?

16:09.112 --> 16:11.214
I said
I don't remember.

16:11.481 --> 16:13.684
Were you drunk or something?
No.

16:13.750 --> 16:17.487
How old were you?
Just stop it.

16:17.554 --> 16:18.989
Did it hurt?

16:19.056 --> 16:21.091
Gina, I'm not talking
about it.

16:21.158 --> 16:22.793
Who was the guy?
Do I know him?

16:22.859 --> 16:24.161
Are you deaf?

16:24.227 --> 16:26.563
I said I don't want
to talk about it!

16:28.699 --> 16:30.233
Bitch.

16:34.204 --> 16:36.807
( dramatic theme playing )

16:45.983 --> 16:48.018
( crying )

16:51.822 --> 16:53.557
( grunts )

17:14.945 --> 17:16.947
( soft dramatic theme playing )

17:20.065 --> 17:24.102
JOCELYN:
It's okay, I'm here.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.709
Why did you do it?

17:34.613 --> 17:36.748
All her questions...

17:38.517 --> 17:41.653
All the memories
just came back.

17:44.156 --> 17:46.825
You know
it wasn't your fault.

17:59.438 --> 18:04.109
I mean, do you wanna talk
to someone?

18:04.176 --> 18:06.945
You know that hotline
is open 24/7.

18:07.012 --> 18:08.580
I can call them
if you want.

18:08.647 --> 18:10.849
No.

18:10.916 --> 18:13.485
I've got you.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.654
That's all I need
right now.

18:20.993 --> 18:23.695
I was gonna give this
to you on Friday, but...

18:32.804 --> 18:34.640
This is so you know...

18:37.042 --> 18:40.112
that I am always here
for you.

18:42.748 --> 18:44.416
Okay?

18:49.054 --> 18:51.490
It's beautiful.

18:57.529 --> 18:59.164
Thank you.

19:07.973 --> 19:10.175
Look, it's two
 corazoncitos.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.045
It's like a mini-me
 corazoncito with a big one.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.414
( both laughing )

19:15.480 --> 19:18.483
( clicking tongue )

19:18.550 --> 19:20.719
You do know
it's 90 degrees outside.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.120
Yeah, yeah,
laugh all you want,

19:22.187 --> 19:24.856
but East Los
is feeling my New York vibe,

19:24.923 --> 19:28.460
'cause I just got nominated
for Homecoming King.

19:28.527 --> 19:30.595
What?
That's awesome.

19:30.662 --> 19:32.698
What?
You just got here.

19:32.764 --> 19:35.100
I guess
I just got it like that.

19:35.167 --> 19:39.104
Well, we know who made it on
the Bomb Squad and who didn't.

19:39.171 --> 19:42.007
I'm happy
for you guys, and Gina,

19:42.074 --> 19:44.009
and I'm even
happier for me.

19:44.076 --> 19:46.745
I know, right? You got nominated
for Homecoming Queen!

19:46.812 --> 19:50.615
I did? No way!

19:51.750 --> 19:53.418
Um, too bad
I'm not going.

19:53.485 --> 19:54.786
The hell you aren't.

19:54.853 --> 19:56.755
What could be more important
than Homecoming?

19:56.822 --> 19:58.957
I'm going to see Jocelyn
at her poetry slam.

19:59.024 --> 20:02.794
Like I said, what could be more
important than Homecoming?

20:02.861 --> 20:05.163
Joss, you don't mind if Camila
goes to the dance with me?

20:05.430 --> 20:07.666
Yeah, I do mind.
We made plans.

20:07.733 --> 20:09.034
She has to go.

20:09.101 --> 20:11.036
What if Camila wins,
and she's not there?

20:11.103 --> 20:12.704
She's gonna win.
Look at her.

20:12.771 --> 20:14.873
Thank you.
What do you say, Joss?

20:14.940 --> 20:17.008
Stop asking me.
It's up to her.

20:17.075 --> 20:19.478
I'm okay
with whatever she decides.

20:21.079 --> 20:24.015
Are you sure?
Of course!

20:24.082 --> 20:25.717
What if you won,
and you weren't there?

20:25.784 --> 20:27.886
The world would end!
Exactly!

20:30.555 --> 20:31.923
We could all go together.

20:31.990 --> 20:33.992
No way
I'm missing my show.

20:35.761 --> 20:37.729
Then it's settled.

20:37.796 --> 20:40.165
I guess you and me
got a date.

20:40.432 --> 20:42.934
Dang!
I got nominated!

20:43.001 --> 20:45.470
CAMILA:
Right!

20:45.537 --> 20:48.573
FILIBERTA:
Gonna be awesome.
What are you gonna wear?

20:48.640 --> 20:51.877
Oh, shit,
you're letting me take this?

20:51.943 --> 20:53.745
Come on, boy.

20:53.812 --> 20:55.881
You really like this girl
you're going to the dance with?

20:55.947 --> 20:58.583
Man, I've been feelin' her
since we were kids.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.952
I know it's
a little dirty,

21:01.019 --> 21:03.121
but if this ride
don't get you laid,

21:03.188 --> 21:05.157
then nothing will.

21:05.423 --> 21:07.993
You da man.
Don't sweat it.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.028
I may hit you for an errand
after your date, all right?

21:10.095 --> 21:11.530
Anything you need, boss.

21:11.596 --> 21:13.865
Hey, I owe you big time.

21:15.467 --> 21:16.968
Whoa-ho-ho!

21:19.471 --> 21:21.640
Thanks for volunteering,
but we still need

21:21.706 --> 21:23.942
a couple more chaperones
for the dance.

21:24.009 --> 21:26.511
Oh!
How about Ceci?

21:26.578 --> 21:28.547
She knows where
the kids hide the vodka.

21:28.613 --> 21:29.981
Good call.

21:30.048 --> 21:32.551
I will see you
Friday night.

21:32.617 --> 21:34.753
Anything you want, Ms. A.

21:34.820 --> 21:36.988
Jacob, I'm gonna kick your ass!
Get back here!

21:37.055 --> 21:38.790
Nice.

21:38.857 --> 21:41.626
Only 28 hours.
Till the dance?

21:41.693 --> 21:43.595
No, until after the dance.
( laughs )

21:43.662 --> 21:45.397
What's up, guys?
Hey, what up?

21:45.463 --> 21:47.032
How's it goin?
Hey, did you find a date?

21:47.098 --> 21:49.801
What you think?
No.

21:49.868 --> 21:52.137
Who?
Me.

21:52.404 --> 21:54.906
Tiffany?
Jack, you scored!

21:54.973 --> 21:56.107
Thank you.

21:56.174 --> 21:58.109
Oh, my God, we can
double date now.

21:58.176 --> 22:00.445
GINA: Yeah!
That'd be great.

22:00.512 --> 22:02.747
Yeah, great.

22:04.549 --> 22:07.085
( dramatic theme playing )

22:16.494 --> 22:18.830
When you're done,
wash the car.

22:21.766 --> 22:24.903
( Latin pop theme playing )
