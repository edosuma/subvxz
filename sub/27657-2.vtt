00:02.730 --> 00:06.030
Could I make my mum magic
if I had an extraordinary potion?

00:06.080 --> 00:10.240
A wishing star. The most highly
concentrated potion in witchcraft.

00:10.290 --> 00:11.510
She cheated!

00:11.560 --> 00:15.110
Mildred Hubble is an honest witch.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.720
Miss Cackle offered me the job
earlier and I accepted.

Mum!

01:04.599 --> 01:06.600
That's Ms Hubble, to you!

01:08.000 --> 01:11.560
It really is
a most dangerous decision.

01:11.610 --> 01:13.350
I disagree.

01:13.400 --> 01:16.120
The girls will benefit from
a more balanced education.

01:16.170 --> 01:18.270
Mildred will be a problem shared

01:18.320 --> 01:21.720
and Ms Hubble,
to whom we owe a debt of gratitude,

01:21.770 --> 01:24.560
will get a well-deserved
opportunity.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.280
Well, I for one intend to
give her a wide berth.

01:29.330 --> 01:31.720
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Who is it?

01:31.770 --> 01:34.160
Ethel Hallow, Miss Cackle.

01:43.280 --> 01:45.190
Well met, Miss Cackle,
Miss Hardbroom.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.840
I wanted to talk to you,
at your earliest convenience.

01:48.890 --> 01:50.510
I don't know about convenient,

01:50.560 --> 01:53.000
I've got an important
announcement to make.

01:53.050 --> 01:54.840
But come on in.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.415
Now, what's this all about?

01:58.465 --> 02:00.310
The wishing star, Miss Cackle,

02:00.360 --> 02:03.355
and how Mildred Hubble
cost me what's rightfully mine.

02:03.405 --> 02:06.400
I'm definitely not picking
Spell Science as an option.

02:06.450 --> 02:08.280
I think it's compulsory.

02:11.520 --> 02:16.400
Well met, Ms Hubble, and welcome.
We're delighted your joining us.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.555
I've assigned Miss Hardbroom
as your mentor.

02:20.605 --> 02:23.670
She'll show you around,
help you get settled in.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.800
Hard luck, Miss H. You're stuck
with the new girl who doesn't know

02:27.850 --> 02:30.680
one end of a broom from the other!

02:30.730 --> 02:32.240
Shall we?

02:33.200 --> 02:34.880
Here goes everything.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.470
- Good morning, everyone.
- ALL: Good morning, Miss Cackle!

02:44.520 --> 02:49.080
I wanted to take this opportunity
to introduce you to Ms Hubble,

02:49.130 --> 02:50.590
your new art teacher.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.040
What? Since when?!
Is that Mildred's mum?

02:54.090 --> 02:56.300
It can't be, she's not a witch!

02:56.350 --> 02:58.560
You've got to be kidding me!

03:00.440 --> 03:02.160
If there are any questions...

03:08.680 --> 03:09.830
Right.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.800
In that case, breakfast on.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.555
Snail and suet porridge.

03:17.605 --> 03:20.400
I'm fine, thank you.

03:25.240 --> 03:31.440
Ah, Miss Bat. Welcome to Cackles,
onward, ever striving on.

03:31.490 --> 03:32.750
Mr Rowan Webb.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.320
Delighted, my dear.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.870
I'm so happy you're here!

03:37.920 --> 03:40.480
I think Miss Drill is grateful
to have a colleague

03:40.530 --> 03:42.620
who is not quite so ancient!

03:42.670 --> 03:44.710
Well, we're all young at heart.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.600
Though slightly older
in other places.

03:49.120 --> 03:54.120
Perhaps I should show
Ms Hubble around the academy.

03:54.170 --> 03:57.070
Right. Yes. Good idea.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.310
Come and find as at break time.
We'll fill you in.

04:00.360 --> 04:05.600
Carry on, girls, as you can see,
Ms Hubble is quite unremarkable.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.950
I expect they'll settle down,
get used to me.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.480
Perhaps, if you last
the preliminary probation period.

04:13.530 --> 04:15.800
Oh, Miss Cackle
didn't mention anything about...

04:15.850 --> 04:17.149
It is standard practice,

04:17.200 --> 04:19.680
a safety net
for both employer and employee.

04:19.730 --> 04:21.310
Yes, of course.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.230
You may grow weary
of our witchy ways.

04:24.280 --> 04:29.320
And we may discover there is nothing
we can learn from you.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.590
I hope not.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.240
Do not force yourself to fit in
where you do not belong.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.315
My mum would make
a much better teacher.

04:44.365 --> 04:46.910
She'd raise the IQ
of the whole academy.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.320
Well, people can be clever
in different ways.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.080
I just wanted to say,
you were fantastic in the air.

04:54.130 --> 04:56.590
The wishing star
should definitely be yours.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.520
It's a complete travesty, but Miss
Cackle won't listen to reason.

04:59.570 --> 05:01.560
Your control was masterful.

05:01.610 --> 05:03.550
And Mildred Hubble cheated.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.590
I know. And I can't abide a cheat.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.160
But what about the time you cloned
yourself, and the time you...?

05:09.210 --> 05:10.670
Thank you, Sybil.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.640
Everyone including the Great Wizard
knows how you feel about me.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.880
Look at her, as happy
as a witch in a broomstick factory.

05:18.930 --> 05:21.320
It's like Miss Cackle's
rewarding her

05:21.370 --> 05:23.310
for tricking me out of my prize.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.070
First that drippy dog,
now her mother.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.560
It is a bit weird that she's
employed a non-magical teacher.

05:29.610 --> 05:32.920
Yeah. We're here to learn
witchcraft, not handicrafts.

05:32.970 --> 05:35.990
[SHE LAUGHS]
You are funny, Claris!

05:36.040 --> 05:40.000
You're learning about fly
transformations, aren't you?

05:40.050 --> 05:42.720
Anyone want to learn some
next-level stuff?

05:42.770 --> 05:45.480
Yes, yes. We'd love to! Wouldn't we?

05:45.530 --> 05:48.630
No? Not interested?

05:48.680 --> 05:50.920
Looks like it's just
you and me, then.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.670
It's amazing, isn't it?

05:53.720 --> 05:55.880
Your mum will be the first-ever
non-magical teacher

05:55.930 --> 05:57.640
at any witching academy ever.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.840
Well, you've seen the plaque.
Us Hubbles make history.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.080
[BELL RINGS]

06:10.200 --> 06:11.800
We've run out of time.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.960
But there's plenty more
where that came from.

Are you ready to
knock their boots off?

06:19.130 --> 06:21.630
Totally. You're the best teacher.

You mustn't let the others
hold you back, OK?

06:24.170 --> 06:26.600
You're a star, you deserve to shine.

06:26.650 --> 06:27.950
Thanks, Ethel.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.720
We've both got
a lot to do this morning.

06:38.080 --> 06:41.430
A-ha! Latecomer penalty question.

06:41.480 --> 06:47.110
What is the difference between
a bird and a fly?

06:47.160 --> 06:50.840
A fly is an arthropod insect whilst
a bird is a warm-blooded vertebrate.

06:50.890 --> 06:52.110
No!

06:52.160 --> 06:55.680
A bird can fly,
but a fly can't bird!

06:55.730 --> 06:59.390
Ha-ha-ha, a fly can't...bird.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.320
Art isn't something
that can really be taught.

07:03.370 --> 07:06.560
I mean, it is, that's why I'm here.

07:06.610 --> 07:08.430
But...

07:08.480 --> 07:14.640
But, take these plants. I mean,
I would say that they're green.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.920
But are they?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.675
Oh, glad you could
make it, Ethel.

07:22.725 --> 07:24.910
Late but worth the wait, Ms Hubble.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.030
Good to know.
We were just getting started.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.800
Now, all great artists
take inspiration from nature.

07:31.850 --> 07:36.280
So, give me your interpretation

07:36.330 --> 07:39.760
of this Venus flytrap.

07:41.080 --> 07:46.160
Now, there's no right or wrong.
Just have a go.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.640

08:01.657 --> 08:04.463

08:04.513 --> 08:07.320

08:22.160 --> 08:24.470
It's a masterpiece.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.560
But it's not your masterpiece.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.110
I was experimenting.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.815
Well, that's good,
that's good, but, you know,

08:33.865 --> 08:36.520
my classes are about
using your own skills,

08:36.570 --> 08:38.309
not magic.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.320
If you were magic, you'd realise
that was pretty pointless.

08:41.370 --> 08:44.440
Well, I'd like you to
do it again, please.

08:44.490 --> 08:47.910
And this time, paint it yourself.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.920
Remember, an original is always
worth more than a copy.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.760
Brambles mixed with Burdock root

through the air with glee,

09:03.010 --> 09:04.320
this pencil now becomes a bee.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.200
Wait a minute!

09:07.480 --> 09:10.400
These are extra difficult
because of the stripes.

Ethel and I are doing ladybirds
next in...

09:13.050 --> 09:14.990

09:15.040 --> 09:20.360
Not only was that
not the spell I requested,

09:20.410 --> 09:23.400
but it's very rude to interrupt.

09:23.450 --> 09:24.510
You just interrupted me!

09:24.560 --> 09:26.470
I was interrupting
your interruption!

09:26.520 --> 09:28.920
Is it not interrupting
if you interrupt an interruption?

That's enough, Miss Twigg.

May I suggest you read up on
classroom protocol,

or you will find yourself
in charge of a circus.

Good advice, noted.

you check that ego, amigo?

definitely up to something.

any worse.

14:00.450 --> 14:04.400
Total twaddle.
He's just trying to dim your light.

14:04.450 --> 14:06.150
I know what'll cheer you up.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.960
Meet me in the art room at
break-time to see some major magic.

14:10.010 --> 14:12.000
Really? I'll be there.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.070
How's your new friend?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.880
Almost exactly where I want her.

14:17.930 --> 14:19.720
Is Old Mother Hubble OK?

14:19.770 --> 14:21.560
Put a sock in it, Ethel.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.630
Less dawdling.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.230
Today's task is to brew up
a digestion potion.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.120
We've got to do something.
Make Mum the best teacher.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.480
Concentrate.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.440
It's such a relief to be
back in a controlled classroom.

14:35.490 --> 14:37.510
What do you mean?

14:37.560 --> 14:41.870
- I wouldn't like to speak out of turn.
- Naturally.

14:41.920 --> 14:47.120
Art with Miss Mould was horribly
hopeless, but at least we felt safe.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.910
I see. Thank you, Ethel.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.115
What would be
the best art lesson ever?

14:54.165 --> 14:56.270
We could turbo-power
the paintbrushes.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.510
Yeah, but we can't use magic.
I promised my mum.

14:58.560 --> 15:04.400
I have some business to take care
of. Continue in absolute silence.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.830
Did we have a meeting?

15:11.880 --> 15:14.760
I thought might like
the Hubble headlines.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.510
What are you doing?

15:19.560 --> 15:23.520
I'm making a living paint potion
to teach Ms Hubble a lesson.

15:23.570 --> 15:25.680
Which is more than she can do.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.615
All the pictures we have painted

15:29.665 --> 15:32.067
Come to life and get acquainted

15:32.117 --> 15:34.470

15:34.520 --> 15:37.640
And leave poor Mildred high and dry.

15:54.240 --> 15:59.195
0801: Ms Hubble was spotted wearing
non-regulation footwear.

15:59.245 --> 16:04.200
Rule five, paragraph two of
the witches code expressly states...

16:04.250 --> 16:06.320
Right, but she's not
actually a witch.

16:06.370 --> 16:07.830
So we can't...

16:07.880 --> 16:11.870
Hold her to the same standards?

16:11.920 --> 16:16.760
Julie's here to bring some balance.
Take Mildred under her wing.

16:18.360 --> 16:21.720

addressing a teacher

Get it off me!

17:13.560 --> 17:15.310
Can't you do something magicky?

17:15.359 --> 17:18.160
I didn't look up the reversal spell!

17:21.720 --> 17:24.069
I'll get help.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.839
No! Don't leave me!

What on Earth is going on?

18:45.200 --> 18:48.415
Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom
were just looking for your mum.

18:48.465 --> 18:51.630
What?! You don't think they're
sacking her already, do you?

18:51.680 --> 18:54.800
Are you coming to see Ethel's
spell? I hope we haven't missed it.

18:54.850 --> 18:56.030
What spell?

18:56.080 --> 18:58.440
I'm not sure. She just told me
to go to the art room.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.520
It was water-based paint,
so I thought...

19:04.570 --> 19:06.470
Clever. Very clever.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.310
Mum, is everything all right?
What happened?

19:09.360 --> 19:12.680
Thank you, Mildred. That's what
we're trying to work out.

19:14.240 --> 19:18.720
I think Miss Hallow
might have some explaining to do.

19:18.770 --> 19:19.950
I...

19:20.000 --> 19:22.295
I cast a living paint spell.

19:22.345 --> 19:24.590
What on Earth possessed you?

19:24.640 --> 19:27.840
She was trying to make my mum look
bad while she was still on trial.

19:27.890 --> 19:32.280
Miss Hardbroom told me about
the preliminary probation period.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.960
We'll discuss this later.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.070
Right now I'd like Ethel to explain

19:39.120 --> 19:42.480
why she felt the need to torment
Ms Hubble in the first place.

19:42.530 --> 19:45.040
I don't want a non-magical teacher.

19:45.090 --> 19:47.550
There's nothing
I can learn from her.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.320
Cackles girls
are the witches of the future.

19:50.370 --> 19:52.150
With an attitude like yours,

19:52.200 --> 19:55.000
I shudder to think
what that future will be.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.030
Tidy up this mess.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.880
Then go to your room while I decide
on an appropriate punishment.

20:07.480 --> 20:11.200
It seems we owe you yet another
debt of gratitude, Ms Hubble.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.990
I wish common-sense was more common.

20:14.040 --> 20:18.830
We witches tend to rely on magic -
spell first, think later.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.560
It's one of the reasons you're
such a great addition to the team.

20:22.610 --> 20:26.240
Rest assured,
your probationary period is over.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.560
You know why
I did what I did, right?

20:36.240 --> 20:37.630
We came here to learn,

20:37.680 --> 20:40.400
to be the best witches
we can possibly be.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.390
The others won't get it.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.720
But you're clever, you understand.

20:47.770 --> 20:49.510
I did it for us.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.075
Clarice, we heard what happened.
Are you OK?

20:52.125 --> 20:54.640
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

20:54.690 --> 20:56.630
Don't bother with the tears.

20:56.680 --> 21:00.120
I'm glad you finally got
a taste of your own potion.

Can you finish tidying up, Clarice?

21:03.010 --> 21:04.760

You'll come and see me later,
won't you?

21:09.085 --> 21:11.320
We can move on from
beasts to ladybirds.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.440
You don't have to.

21:13.490 --> 21:14.920

21:17.560 --> 21:20.110
Stop. Clarice, she's using you.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.595
Ethel never does anything for anyone

21:22.645 --> 21:25.030

in return.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.310
How can you be so mean
about your own sister?

21:27.360 --> 21:31.200
You've seen what she is capable of.
You could have all been plant food.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.560
She said you wouldn't understand.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.760
- Oh, Miss Hardbroom, you made me...
- Jump?

21:46.440 --> 21:50.760

our ways, Ms Hubble.

any misunderstandings.

23:30.050 --> 23:32.760
that Mildred cost me
the wishing star.

23:32.810 --> 23:34.830
Sybil said that was the reason.

What Sybil doesn't understand is,
I wanted to win it for her.

23:39.370 --> 23:41.390
I'd do anything for my sisters.

23:41.440 --> 23:44.110

for Esmerelda,

I wanted to restore
the family name for Sybil.

23:46.650 --> 23:48.080
You'd give up your wish for her?

23:48.130 --> 23:49.390
Absolutely.

If I wasn't in so much trouble
already, I'd go get the star myself.
