01:10.023 --> 01:12.512
Cameron!

01:18.480 --> 01:21.904
Hi.
-My boss is gonna kill me for leaving early.

01:22.029 --> 01:24.941
What is your emergency?
I can't believe you brought me out in the rain.

01:24.976 --> 01:27.225
Stop, i love a little summer rain.

01:27.282 --> 01:30.343
I think it's romantic.
And what are you talking about?

01:30.398 --> 01:32.531
I thought you quit the travel agency
to supervise your remodelling..

01:32.558 --> 01:36.833
I did but Owen's out of control,
and now i'm working like a dog to pay for it.

01:36.872 --> 01:38.498
And Cameron, i can't tell Ben.

01:38.535 --> 01:40.857
What's the rush?
You know the market would turn around.

01:40.903 --> 01:42.757
There's only one Hamptons.

01:42.791 --> 01:44.546
Why am i here?
What is your emergency?

01:45.016 --> 01:47.131
Okay..

01:47.610 --> 01:50.349
Speaking of the old Hamptons getaway..

01:50.474 --> 01:53.126
I need to borrow it.

01:53.251 --> 01:54.238
Why?

01:54.301 --> 01:56.686
I'm having a little open house myself.

01:57.013 --> 01:58.587
But only one guy is coming.

01:58.614 --> 02:01.209
Read.. His name is Hugh.

02:05.753 --> 02:07.994
I mean she's my future baby mama.

02:08.030 --> 02:11.791
I love me my Kate.
-It's not about love, how's your sex life?

02:13.048 --> 02:14.864
It's..

02:14.963 --> 02:17.450
It's fine.
-My point percisely.

02:17.486 --> 02:19.810
You gotta spice it up.
-By banging other girls?

02:19.837 --> 02:22.720
Slow down buddy,
you're not there yet.

02:22.972 --> 02:23.992
Slow down.

02:24.046 --> 02:26.134
Start by..

02:26.333 --> 02:27.969
Asking Kate for a threesome.

02:28.004 --> 02:29.035
Are you out of your mind?

02:29.071 --> 02:30.948
Why not? You ever had one?
-No.

02:30.983 --> 02:32.737
See, you know i know women.

02:32.782 --> 02:36.181
You know this, but you gotta grow a pair
and ask her.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.781
You know what?
I'm not even supposed to say this..

02:38.835 --> 02:41.483
But Kate has asked Cameron about it.

02:41.512 --> 02:44.469
No, that don't work me.
That is bull.

02:44.486 --> 02:47.704
There are clear cut signs,
for when a woman wants to sleep around.

02:47.723 --> 02:51.467
I know this, perfect hair, good panties,
night time make up in the morning..

02:51.494 --> 02:53.719
Like you would know good panties.

02:54.025 --> 02:58.562
I'm just saying, if the sex is already boring
and you're not even married yet..

02:58.589 --> 03:01.120
Why not throw it out?

03:02.520 --> 03:04.491
I couldn't handle a threesome.

03:04.526 --> 03:05.982
I couldn't do it, honestly.

03:06.009 --> 03:08.901
I'm just not well-verse enough
on threeway ettiquete.

03:08.946 --> 03:10.395
I mean where to start..

03:10.412 --> 03:12.410
What to put where,
who do you do first..

03:12.437 --> 03:15.034
Am i paying too much attention,
not enough attention..

03:15.070 --> 03:17.239
Who to thank..
The pressure.

03:17.257 --> 03:18.677
You thank everybody.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.811
I can't believe you're having an affair.

03:20.838 --> 03:22.727
Not an affair.

03:22.781 --> 03:26.298
A fling, a larc, a bump, bootycall.

03:26.379 --> 03:27.482
Little bump and grind.

03:27.510 --> 03:29.227
What about your husband?

03:29.272 --> 03:31.275
It was Vince's idea.

03:31.311 --> 03:34.032
You're having an open marriage?
How come you never told me this?

03:34.049 --> 03:37.631
Over 50% of marriages fail because of infidelity.

03:37.649 --> 03:39.549
So, right before we got married..

03:39.606 --> 03:42.873
Vince came out with the 10 rules
to a healthy open relationship.

03:42.909 --> 03:44.464
How many men have you been with?

03:44.479 --> 03:46.749
That we would never end up divorce because of cheating.
-How many?

03:46.763 --> 03:49.410
Men biologically have the need to spread their seeds..

03:49.432 --> 03:51.254
How many men?
-Doesn't matter.

03:51.282 --> 03:52.982
Do you think Hugh would like this?

03:53.107 --> 03:55.128
It has no zippers or buttons.

03:55.352 --> 03:56.394
He'll love it.

03:57.283 --> 03:59.653
So, he made up 10 rules.

03:59.675 --> 04:02.945
Yeah, 1.. Never go out with an ex.
-Right.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.226
2.. No more than 3 dates with the same person.

04:06.241 --> 04:11.536
3.. no pictures, video, or media yet to be invented
throughout the universe.

04:11.571 --> 04:15.991
4.. Always an away game, never on home turf.
That includes friends and neighbor's beds.

04:16.012 --> 04:17.807
It can be wrong.
-Yeah.

04:18.334 --> 04:21.236
Number 5 AKA the no Marv Albert play by play..

04:21.250 --> 04:23.517
No announcements, no intros,
no details..

04:23.545 --> 04:26.256
You see each other in public,
you keep walking.

04:26.278 --> 04:29.737
Hold it Cammie, this is way to Maxim.

04:29.863 --> 04:32.955
And i don't even read Maxim.

04:34.192 --> 04:37.062
What happened if you just woke up one morning, and you were like..

04:38.359 --> 04:40.990
Time for some fresh dick.

04:41.937 --> 04:42.836
Sorry.

04:42.871 --> 04:44.672
Number 6, the neighborhood blackout rule.

04:44.719 --> 04:47.860
Stay away from favorite restaurants,
clubs, hangouts.

04:47.902 --> 04:50.478
7.. The group maxed no more than 5 at a time.

04:50.513 --> 04:53.261
Time out, flag on the play.

04:53.290 --> 04:56.107
What does it matter how many people if you're open about it?

04:56.136 --> 04:58.912
More than 5 people becomes an orgy,
i have standard..

04:58.927 --> 05:00.799
But as high as a limbo stick.

05:00.828 --> 05:03.583
8.. No gifts, giving or receiving..

05:03.640 --> 05:06.279
9.. The no sleeping with friends and family plan.

05:06.294 --> 05:07.894
That includes second and third cousins.

05:07.924 --> 05:11.561
God, that is so gross. Only you Vince, would need a rule like that.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.744
The number 1..

05:13.946 --> 05:16.506
On the Letterman's top 10,
this is important..

05:16.615 --> 05:18.315
Never ever ever..

05:18.365 --> 05:20.976
Ever say i love you.

05:21.315 --> 05:23.708
Maybe you should consider separation.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.667
Hell no.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.079
How can i blame him for something i stupidly agree?

05:28.108 --> 05:31.145
You don't have to,
that's what divorce lawyers are for.

05:31.625 --> 05:33.425
You don't get it, girl.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.626
I love him.

05:34.654 --> 05:37.643
Right, but this makes stupid.
Like..

05:38.170 --> 05:39.920
Stupid.
-Taxi!

05:40.496 --> 05:42.310
Taxi!

05:43.214 --> 05:44.841
Stay, stay, stay.

05:46.045 --> 05:49.081
Please.
-Owen is at Loraine's in the Hamptons, so you'll be good.

05:49.111 --> 05:50.340
Great.

05:50.388 --> 05:52.296
Hey, can you keep this for me
til tomorrow?

05:52.311 --> 05:54.255
I don't want Vince to see it.
-Sure.

05:54.524 --> 05:56.215
I love you.

05:56.540 --> 05:59.044
You and your summer rain.

06:10.117 --> 06:13.416
You two should only be as lucky as us.

06:13.445 --> 06:15.210
And you know why?
-Enlighten us.

06:15.246 --> 06:18.900
It's because we're always completely honest
and open with each other.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.717
And because we keep surprising each other..

06:21.760 --> 06:25.064
This year for your birthday,
i'm taking you antiqing in Rhode Island.

06:25.101 --> 06:27.739
No..
-What, no!
-Yes..

06:27.783 --> 06:29.019
You're so sweet.

06:29.033 --> 06:30.660
Quaint little B&B..

06:30.786 --> 06:34.663
No television, no phone,
just you and me my dear, that's it.

06:34.789 --> 06:36.492
I love you.
-I love you.

06:36.557 --> 06:38.856
I have been asking him to do this forever.

06:38.871 --> 06:39.897
No TV?

06:39.904 --> 06:41.676
It's after the playoffs,
don't worry about it.

06:41.705 --> 06:45.629
Hey guys, so what brings us to this two credit card dinner?

06:45.664 --> 06:48.369
Who is the hottest children's author..

06:48.421 --> 06:50.402
Since Harry Potter?

06:50.527 --> 06:52.643
Emma Cooney.
-Boom, there you go.
-What?

06:52.678 --> 06:55.161
Vince is going to be meeting with her on Friday.
-No..

06:55.183 --> 06:56.701
To discuss the publishing of her new book..

06:56.723 --> 06:58.263
Oh my god, why didn't you tell me?

06:58.285 --> 07:00.400
Because you would have bought a new dress.

07:00.450 --> 07:03.226
This one can shop more than a speedfreak on Ebay.

07:03.284 --> 07:06.343
He's got that right, wait til Hugh sees her in that new dress.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.651
You can really go from..

07:08.672 --> 07:12.768
Sweet to shitty in one second.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom..

07:12.992 --> 07:14.907
I will be right back.

07:15.032 --> 07:18.276
No more working, and travels for you.

07:18.306 --> 07:22.360
I am just gonna leave you two alone
for a minute.

07:25.376 --> 07:26.591
ask her.

07:27.409 --> 07:28.970
What's going on?

07:29.095 --> 07:30.864
I have to ask you something.

07:31.702 --> 07:32.382
Sure.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.516
You know it's only taking me this long to propose to you because..

07:34.544 --> 07:38.980
I don't want us to end up miserable like my folks,
because they constantly broke..

07:39.002 --> 07:40.990
I can still hear my mom said..

07:41.041 --> 07:44.290
No money comes in the door,
love flies out the window.

07:44.341 --> 07:47.118
I love you.
-I keep telling you, it doesn't matter to me.

07:47.168 --> 07:50.040
We'll do our house up, and we'll sell it..

07:50.090 --> 07:53.048
And it'll be our little nest egg, you and i.

07:53.308 --> 07:56.218
Thank god we pulled the plug on that fru fru decorator guy..

07:56.240 --> 07:59.349
Otherwise our nest egg, will be a tree house.

07:59.370 --> 08:03.147
That's besides the point, that's your money.
I don't want it.

08:04.130 --> 08:08.304
I'm sorry that our sex life hasn't exactly been..
-Ben, don't worry. You know what?

08:08.340 --> 08:12.782
We've both been really busy and you're focusing on the business, it's fine.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.101
Right. No, wrong.
-Wrong.

08:15.188 --> 08:16.214
Way wrong.

08:16.243 --> 08:18.109
Okay, i've been thinking about something.

08:20.295 --> 08:22.421
I don't even know how to say this.

08:23.281 --> 08:25.423
I'm nervous.
-It's okay.

08:25.480 --> 08:26.978
I think..

08:27.103 --> 08:29.992
That the way to take our relationship
to the next level..

08:30.026 --> 08:31.689
Yeah..

08:36.755 --> 08:38.717
Is..
-It's okay.

08:38.783 --> 08:40.323
I'm gonna say yes..

08:40.345 --> 08:42.087
Well..

08:44.370 --> 08:46.258
Will you have a threesome with me?

08:48.645 --> 08:52.219
Well, you.. I can't wait to get you fuck me.

08:52.277 --> 08:55.044
Because i have a surprise..

08:55.065 --> 08:57.257
Probably Chlamydia..
Hurry up.

09:00.267 --> 09:02.725
Really?
Really you'll have a threesome with me?

09:02.748 --> 09:04.367
Definitely.

09:04.389 --> 09:08.215
I've always wanted to know
what it would be like with..

09:08.562 --> 09:10.161
Two guys.

09:16.198 --> 09:21.124
The only question is, tomorrow morning do i text you
or do i nudge you.

09:23.315 --> 09:25.904
What's up, cool breeze?
How did it go?

09:25.943 --> 09:28.516
Awful, the worst possible way it could have gone..

09:28.530 --> 09:30.404
Then you didn't sell it right.

09:30.425 --> 09:33.109
I definitely sold it, she said yes.

09:33.123 --> 09:34.504
Then what's the problem?

09:36.588 --> 09:38.446
Hey, is that you?

09:39.097 --> 09:41.642
Oh my God.
Hi.

09:41.699 --> 09:43.017
Matt!

09:43.046 --> 09:45.041
How are you?
-So good to see you.

09:45.078 --> 09:48.065
You still look amazing.

09:48.107 --> 09:49.923
Nice to see some things don't change.

09:49.944 --> 09:51.678
You still look like you're in shape.

09:51.738 --> 09:54.638
You always did like breaking a sweat.
-Yeah, i remember our litte work out.

09:55.369 --> 09:57.075
Let's do punch tomorrow.

09:57.774 --> 09:59.929
i'm only in town for two days on business.

09:59.950 --> 10:01.708
We got a lot of catching up to do.

10:02.467 --> 10:04.266
9am. Lugo's.

10:04.302 --> 10:05.965
Okay.
-See you tomorrow.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.419
Bye.

10:12.792 --> 10:17.032
Hello.. Who was that?

10:17.230 --> 10:19.183
Matt.

10:19.308 --> 10:21.045
Exboyfriend Matt?

10:21.083 --> 10:24.652
Highschool pole vaulter Matt..

10:24.696 --> 10:28.085
Damn, he can stick it to me anytime.

10:29.152 --> 10:31.168
Ladies..

10:36.461 --> 10:38.829
Perfect time.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.365
A threeway?

10:40.447 --> 10:44.009
Ben can't even get a boner
with a cat in the room.

10:44.134 --> 10:46.747
Matt would never share me with anyone.

10:48.403 --> 10:50.716
At least Benny's getting laid.

10:50.841 --> 10:52.804
I wonder what the Yanks are doing tonight?

10:54.316 --> 10:57.181
It's not slutty,
we're evolved.

10:57.245 --> 10:59.431
It's so European.

11:01.396 --> 11:05.400
Great, i'm gonna have some guy's balls
in my face.

11:05.734 --> 11:07.831
I'm gonna kill Vince.

11:15.815 --> 11:19.702
We're here at the palatial estate of media Tsar,
Jeffery Field.

11:19.738 --> 11:24.974
His legendary summer, starstudded
la Dolce Vita Ball is the party of the season.

11:25.020 --> 11:26.568
The place to be.

11:26.614 --> 11:28.385
Security is tight.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.626
But i had a chance to sit down with the..

11:30.672 --> 11:33.859
Always controversial Field,
and talk to him about..

11:33.904 --> 11:38.533
His legendary career as well as his notoriously
open lifestyle..

11:38.541 --> 11:41.827
Which is being followed by
his new reality series..

11:41.952 --> 11:43.734
"Fields of Dreams".

11:43.798 --> 11:46.511
Mr Fields, the stories are legendary.

11:46.557 --> 11:49.368
How you started in the mailroom,
work your way all the way up..

11:49.430 --> 11:53.088
To owning your own multimillion dollar empire.

11:53.134 --> 11:55.790
Bullshit, i fucked my way to the top.

11:55.817 --> 11:58.448
I fucked whoever and whatever i had to.

11:58.485 --> 12:02.562
Men, women, i fucked a camel once.
I don't give a shit.

12:02.580 --> 12:06.206
Put it right here in front of my cock,
and i'll fuck it if it means i'll get my way.

12:06.243 --> 12:11.380
I'll fuck you and your cameraman right now,
if it'll make more people watch this shit.

12:13.531 --> 12:16.189
Why don't we talk about your fabulous ball?

12:16.522 --> 12:18.826
Your guest list is the creme de la creme..

12:18.844 --> 12:22.715
Wallstreet, Hollywood celebrities, socialites,
industrial titans..

12:22.749 --> 12:25.745
And my ever presence entourage,
my boys and girls..

12:25.763 --> 12:27.435
The beautiful people..
-yes.

12:27.462 --> 12:30.093
What's your secret?
-I have no secrets.

12:30.128 --> 12:32.513
I'm a media whore, remember?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.239
But i don't give anything away.

12:34.284 --> 12:36.914
So, go to my newest global venture..

12:36.960 --> 12:39.377
FieldEPublishing.com..

12:39.441 --> 12:43.418
And for $9.95, you can download
all the juicy tidbits.

12:43.426 --> 12:46.221
In my best selling autobiography..

12:46.294 --> 12:48.138
I fucked everyone..

12:49.024 --> 12:52.237
And as in all Jeffery Field's gala..

12:52.273 --> 12:55.571
It don't end until the sun shines.

12:55.788 --> 12:57.343
I'm Michael Corbit.

12:58.519 --> 13:01.520
Mr Owen, i was told you want to move the cigar box by 4 feet?

13:01.556 --> 13:03.309
Yes, please thank you.

13:03.336 --> 13:05.355
But.. It's a massive undertaking.

13:05.391 --> 13:07.644
Massive undertaking? Do you feel that breeze?
-Yeah.

13:07.689 --> 13:11.134
See the way the smoke from the cigar is going this way?
If you're smoking a cigar..

13:11.168 --> 13:14.233
Here, and i'm here talking to Gwyneth Paltrow
and Miley Cyrus..

13:14.295 --> 13:17.350
The cigar smoke comes to them,
now they smell like Fidel Castro.

13:17.405 --> 13:21.673
You want that? No, me neither. So, 4 feet, thank you.
-Okay.

13:21.798 --> 13:24.412
Excuse me, why is this purple?

13:24.448 --> 13:26.725
Why is it purple?
I want it violet.

13:26.748 --> 13:30.228
Perfection is our sanctity,
if you don't understand, i'll get someone else.

13:30.300 --> 13:33.021
Thank you, you can take it away now.
Go.

13:33.066 --> 13:36.354
Cherrie..
-Somebody really knows how to crack the whip.

13:36.389 --> 13:39.200
Cherrie, you should see me in the bedroom..

13:39.245 --> 13:40.807
That can be arranged.

13:40.916 --> 13:44.811
If i have met you before that summer
in Vankemp, who knows..

13:44.848 --> 13:46.745
My life might have taken a different turn.

13:46.791 --> 13:50.799
I've got first dibs on Owen.

13:51.025 --> 13:52.967
Besides, i don't think you're his type.

13:53.122 --> 13:55.239
Behave, i'm not a piece of meat.

13:55.284 --> 13:57.706
What is my nosey neighbor Barbara
doing here today?

13:57.778 --> 13:59.027
Being nosey.

13:59.044 --> 14:03.167
I think you're trying to steal my stylist.
Don't worry Barb, i don't think there's a thing he can do to you..

14:03.184 --> 14:05.443
That your plastic surgeon hasn't done already.

14:05.462 --> 14:06.763
I said it.

14:06.808 --> 14:10.942
Stop flirting, if your boyfriend Hans see you touch me,
he's gonna have your nuts in a sling.

14:10.959 --> 14:13.718
If this party isn't uber fabulous,
i'll have your nuts..

14:13.728 --> 14:16.050
And they won't be in a sling.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.117
No no, that sucked.

14:22.172 --> 14:23.717
Let's shoot that again.

14:23.762 --> 14:25.119
Give me the line again.

14:25.165 --> 14:30.136
He'll have nuts..
-Screw it, we'll fix it on the post.

14:30.415 --> 14:32.169
I heard that.

14:48.823 --> 14:51.183
I brought you muffins.

14:51.983 --> 14:56.132
What is IW2SUTYTC mean?

14:56.186 --> 14:58.942
I want to screw you until your toes crawl.
-Oh God.

14:59.024 --> 15:02.748
Cameron, that's disgusting, i need
a wetnap.

15:02.821 --> 15:04.854
I need the keys to your house.

15:04.908 --> 15:06.437
So get this..

15:06.472 --> 15:09.663
Last night, i thought Ben was gonna propose.

15:09.698 --> 15:13.515
Instead, the jerk asked me
for a threeway.
-No.

15:13.559 --> 15:17.238
So i burned him and made up some
BS about wanting 2 guys.

15:17.285 --> 15:19.862
Cameron, Cameron,
this is important to me.

15:19.879 --> 15:21.707
Honey, i'm listening.

15:25.828 --> 15:28.838
Okay okay.
All guys want it..

15:28.884 --> 15:31.812
The only difference is
some have the guts to ask.

15:31.819 --> 15:32.983
Vince asked?

15:33.108 --> 15:36.045
No guts, i'm his Madonna,
the Virgin Mary.

15:36.082 --> 15:40.133
Who's on her way to hook up with some guy
for the weekend.

15:40.682 --> 15:43.395
Why aren't you hooking up
in some hotel in the city?

15:43.425 --> 15:47.642
Because, i told you, Hugh is taking me
to Jeffery Field's La Dolce Vida Ball.

15:47.664 --> 15:50.888
The house is under construction,
i haven't been down there for weeks. Owen is..

15:50.926 --> 15:52.898
He's temperamental.
It's totally a mess.

15:52.927 --> 15:56.845
Every room from South Hamptons to Montaugh is sold out.

15:57.786 --> 15:59.153
Thank you, thank you.
I love you.

15:59.188 --> 16:01.618
I'm sorry i have to run on you big time,
big kiss.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.362
I'm not happy about this.

16:07.629 --> 16:09.504
Oh shit, Cameron.

16:10.089 --> 16:11.593
Cameron, your dress!

16:11.644 --> 16:13.625
Next stop, Hamptons.

16:15.393 --> 16:18.256
Your dress!

16:22.124 --> 16:24.539
Miss Cooney, can i get your autograph please?

16:24.561 --> 16:26.045
Of course, dear.

16:26.435 --> 16:28.185
When is your next book coming out?

16:28.272 --> 16:30.435
It's called
'The Magical Princess'

16:30.472 --> 16:32.648
And it's coming out shortly.

16:39.431 --> 16:40.921
Hi.

16:41.046 --> 16:42.670
Hi.

16:42.996 --> 16:45.028
Hello.
-Hey there.

16:45.591 --> 16:47.297
Weird.

16:48.237 --> 16:53.154
We are auditioning for the "Cooney Magical Princess" book cover, please. Thank you.

16:53.537 --> 16:55.279
Getting a little ahead of ourselves?

16:58.278 --> 16:59.514
Hold on.

17:00.808 --> 17:01.789
Shit.

17:01.832 --> 17:03.416
Oh shit?
-Oh shit?

17:03.453 --> 17:05.946
Why did you say shit for?
I know what shit means, what does it mean?

17:07.561 --> 17:10.771
Need to reschedule Friday lunch
to Monday drinks?

17:10.815 --> 17:13.672
Off to Field's summer ball,
Emma Cooney Ta?

17:13.715 --> 17:14.584
Shit!

17:14.598 --> 17:17.655
I was at his party last year,
and it was ab fab.

17:18.011 --> 17:21.087
Oh my God, you need to get out of here right now.
Sorry.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.728
Really.
-I'm only here about the cover.

17:22.749 --> 17:23.679
What?

17:23.724 --> 17:25.957
Vince said not only do i look like a princess..

17:25.998 --> 17:27.912
But i have that magical quality too.

17:27.935 --> 17:31.327
We don't have much time for magic, but disappear.
Now, seriously.

17:31.344 --> 17:34.094
Hey, ladies audition's over.
Go home.

17:34.464 --> 17:36.860
DUde, this is like Spielberg's boy, okay?

17:36.884 --> 17:39.706
We invited Cooney so we can scoop the deal.
-Do you think?

17:39.781 --> 17:41.569
Yeah, i think.
So what are we gonna do?

17:41.603 --> 17:44.041
Give me the keys to the Hampton's house.
-Why?

17:44.166 --> 17:47.112
I'm gonna get down there to close Cooney
before Field can.

17:47.298 --> 17:51.482
How are you gonna stroll in uninvited
to the party of the summer?

17:52.176 --> 17:53.998
I'm gonna have to crash it.
-Oh my God.

17:54.202 --> 17:56.435
Want me to tell Cameron you're going so she knows it's legit?
-No no.

17:56.459 --> 17:59.249
She thinks i'm golfing whole weekend.
I don't want to confuse things, it's very important.

17:59.388 --> 18:01.279
Excuse me, hey Vince.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.148
God.

18:05.149 --> 18:06.248
Vince!

18:06.479 --> 18:07.499
Vince!
-Yes!

18:07.528 --> 18:08.632
Stay focus.
-Yeah.

18:08.656 --> 18:10.909
You hear me?
None of your bull.

18:11.250 --> 18:14.051
Vince, we need this.
-I know, Cooney not the pooney.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.271
Got it.

18:15.451 --> 18:16.791
Really?

18:20.262 --> 18:21.840
Oh no, Gaby.

18:23.629 --> 18:24.816
Gaby, pick up?

18:36.735 --> 18:39.103
Hi, it's Gabriella.
Please send message.

18:39.138 --> 18:40.948
Gaby, call me as soon as you get this, okay?

18:40.977 --> 18:43.575
My partner Vince is on his way
to the house right now..

18:43.615 --> 18:46.455
So you gotta get to the hotel and get there quick.
I'll pay for it.

18:46.818 --> 18:49.803
Fast, my sweety, very fast.

18:49.827 --> 18:51.402
Ah!

19:00.953 --> 19:03.605
If i had popped the question,
we'd probably on our second kid?

19:03.629 --> 19:05.191
Oh really?

19:07.434 --> 19:09.363
I've been invited to the Dolce La Vita Ball.

19:09.393 --> 19:10.854
You made the guest list?

19:10.926 --> 19:12.609
Yeah.
-One sec.

19:13.344 --> 19:17.352
Sorry, my best friend Cameron is going to that,
i hear it's the party of the year.

19:17.831 --> 19:19.103
Come with me.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.058
He can stick it to me anytime.

19:25.282 --> 19:27.695
I would love to, but..

19:29.378 --> 19:30.685
I can't.

19:37.963 --> 19:39.485
Baby, i'm home.

19:39.599 --> 19:41.046
Hey, honey.

19:42.493 --> 19:43.499
Babe?

19:46.826 --> 19:48.475
What the hell..

19:48.807 --> 19:50.079
Hey.
-Hey.

19:50.121 --> 19:51.327
Where were you?

19:52.130 --> 19:54.077
I was running errands, why?

19:54.095 --> 19:55.421
I've been calling you.

19:55.452 --> 19:56.811
Why are you so dressed up?

19:56.920 --> 19:57.776
I'm not.

19:57.806 --> 20:01.368
Better question, what is with this $1700 dress?

20:01.429 --> 20:02.620
We haven't closed the deal yet.

20:02.645 --> 20:04.110
Relax, it's not even mine.

20:04.141 --> 20:06.438
I'm just returning it for a friend, Ben.

20:12.984 --> 20:14.582
So, what did you..

20:15.082 --> 20:16.510
Ask me about?

20:16.939 --> 20:20.078
The Hampton house,
i thought maybe..

20:21.194 --> 20:22.665
I should take a loan out on it.

20:22.790 --> 20:23.546
A loan?

20:23.593 --> 20:25.854
To offer Emma Cooney a huge advance
on her book.

20:25.958 --> 20:26.936
Why?

20:26.964 --> 20:29.989
Jeffery Field is gonna try and steal our deal.

20:31.192 --> 20:33.190
Unfortunately..

20:33.678 --> 20:37.342
I maxed out the equity we paid for the remodeling.

20:37.401 --> 20:39.134
Jesus Christ!

20:39.654 --> 20:42.186
What did that rip off decorator charge you?

20:42.442 --> 20:44.056
Nevermind, you know what?

20:44.319 --> 20:48.160
Let's just hope that Vince
talks her into it.

20:48.825 --> 20:50.400
He's on his way up there..
-What?

20:50.438 --> 20:52.187
Ben, you should have asked me.

20:52.230 --> 20:57.121
I'll find the money.
-No, about Vince. You shouldn't just let him stay at the house without asking me.

20:57.626 --> 20:58.589
Why is that?

20:58.626 --> 21:00.956
Cause it's a mess.

21:01.513 --> 21:04.637
Vince would live in a leper colony to close a deal.

21:07.025 --> 21:08.804
Is there something else going on?

21:09.599 --> 21:12.132
Ben, don't be silly, it's just..

21:12.591 --> 21:17.304
I would appreciate it if you consulted me
on things that were mine.

21:17.696 --> 21:21.138
Last night, i thought it was our nest egg.

21:22.269 --> 21:24.893
You went ahead and you spend without talking to me.

21:28.207 --> 21:31.807
Vince, via text, what is IW2..

21:31.853 --> 21:34.112
SUTWTC means?

21:34.564 --> 21:36.833
I want to screw you til your toes curl.

21:36.893 --> 21:37.896
Oh my God.

21:37.933 --> 21:39.959
Lucky you, who's texting you?

21:40.027 --> 21:43.102
Vince, i think she's cheating.
-Calm down.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.730
Shit..

21:47.168 --> 21:49.430
Cameron, you idiot.

21:50.041 --> 21:51.714
No, you didn't.

21:52.113 --> 21:55.851
She's wearing night time make up
and it's morning.

22:01.304 --> 22:05.027
Taxi! taxi!
Come on, why don't you stop?

22:05.999 --> 22:08.155
Off to the Hamptons?

22:19.385 --> 22:20.922
Can you take me to the Hamptons?

22:20.960 --> 22:22.797
Hamptons?
-How much for the Hamptons?

22:22.820 --> 22:24.327
No way..

22:38.950 --> 22:41.550
Not the threesome i had in mind.

22:41.588 --> 22:45.465
Baby, i gotta go.
I'm pulling off to Field's mansion now.

22:45.774 --> 22:48.676
Alright, i'm just gonna go the cottage, hurry.

22:54.350 --> 22:59.096
She is the freaking hottest thing
that you have ever seen.

23:01.179 --> 23:03.213
Duncan, i'm telling you.

23:03.274 --> 23:06.321
I'm banging a real cougar tonight.

23:06.404 --> 23:08.982
She's like 28-29 years old.

23:09.019 --> 23:10.743
And she's a real cougar.

23:10.766 --> 23:13.908
No way, no way.
-You'll see her at the party.

23:14.034 --> 23:15.527
Boo yeah!

23:18.159 --> 23:19.951
Hey baby..

23:30.752 --> 23:31.943
Upstairs.

23:31.982 --> 23:34.506
No, no..
We're gonna go right here.

23:35.427 --> 23:38.125
I'm taking you from the couch.

23:38.178 --> 23:39.489
Wow..

23:42.622 --> 23:45.048
Not gonna need these anymore.

23:45.608 --> 23:48.970
Oh my God, you have the prettiest feet i have ever seen.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.539
And i've seen a lot of feet.

23:54.373 --> 23:58.058
It's like two basketballs
hiding under your skirt.

23:58.382 --> 24:00.297
You always this aggresive?

24:00.523 --> 24:03.037
Don't interrupt my skill.

24:03.617 --> 24:06.142
It's time for some butt bongo, baby.

24:06.165 --> 24:09.321
I want to worship your ass.

24:11.052 --> 24:12.711
Aw..

24:14.843 --> 24:16.673
Have you seen Owen?

24:16.786 --> 24:19.733
Yes, he left on an errand,
saying something about the fa grua..

24:19.764 --> 24:21.942
I think a little too much pistachio.

24:23.404 --> 24:26.058
Your guest?
-Go and get your door for Miss Cooney.

24:28.514 --> 24:31.220
Emma. My darling.

24:31.689 --> 24:35.790
Mon Rocchie is chilled, the berries are freshly baked.

24:35.820 --> 24:37.477
You settle in..

24:37.696 --> 24:39.581
And you get ready for a fabulous feta.

24:39.706 --> 24:43.736
After spending a wet winter, freezing my bum off at Sussex,
i'm more than ready.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.791
Take Miss Cooney's things to the lake house.

24:45.814 --> 24:48.128
I have to get ready for the suarrey.

24:48.188 --> 24:52.163
My son is coming home from Andover,
i'm planning a little surprise for him.

24:52.193 --> 24:54.131
You just make yourself at home..

24:54.152 --> 24:56.339
I am so thrilled you're here.

24:56.464 --> 24:58.090
I'm thrilled to be here.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.109
See you.
-Thank you so much.

25:01.610 --> 25:04.389
Crashing this joint is a piece of cake.

25:04.735 --> 25:06.997
Emma Conney, here i come.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.959
Hi, it's Gabriella,
missing you.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.613
Gaby, if you get this,
get out of the house!

25:14.634 --> 25:17.890
Just stay with me,
let your staff do the work.

25:17.920 --> 25:21.212
Are you kidding?
It's the most important event of my career.

25:21.257 --> 25:22.907
Please.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.474
I'll do the thing with my big toe.

25:42.437 --> 25:45.097
You remind me of my aunt.

25:45.288 --> 25:47.420
Only hotter.

25:50.443 --> 25:53.187
Your body is banging.

25:54.612 --> 25:58.077
Oh my God, you are too cool for words.

25:58.130 --> 26:01.434
And way too hot for clothes.

26:13.052 --> 26:17.150
I told you that i have a surprise..

26:17.226 --> 26:19.500
For you.
-Oh my God!

26:19.757 --> 26:22.945
Oh my God!
-Nice surprise.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.792
Kate, what are you doing here?

26:24.815 --> 26:27.272
One second, pitstop,
but don't worry ladies..

26:27.287 --> 26:30.892
My engine is revved up
and i'm ready to go.

26:32.075 --> 26:34.088
How old is he?

26:34.213 --> 26:35.086
Old enough.

26:35.108 --> 26:38.319
He's gotta go, Vince is here to meet Cooney,
the deal is in trouble, he will be here any minute.

26:38.341 --> 26:40.270
What?
Why don't you call me?

26:40.338 --> 26:42.395
Do you hear me now?
-Shit!

26:44.292 --> 26:45.875
Oh my God!

26:45.898 --> 26:48.083
Put it out!
Oh my God, your hand!

26:48.106 --> 26:50.727
What are you doing?
-Putting the fire out!

26:50.772 --> 26:52.920
I'm naked, i'm hitting it.

26:52.943 --> 26:55.389
And then her girlfriend walks in.

26:55.427 --> 26:56.489
No way!

26:56.557 --> 27:00.713
Not one, but two hot and horny cougars!

27:01.633 --> 27:03.637
Excuse me, excuse me..

27:03.690 --> 27:05.965
Can you come over here please?
-Yeah, hi.

27:06.024 --> 27:09.024
Who are you with?
-I'm with the guys.

27:09.047 --> 27:10.291
The guys?

27:10.350 --> 27:11.617
Yeah.

27:11.647 --> 27:13.245
Just doing my thing.

27:13.268 --> 27:14.339
Your thing?

27:14.345 --> 27:17.419
That's cool, cause i thought that you might be
a sneaky snake sneaking in.

27:17.433 --> 27:20.296
Why would i sneak in?
I'm already here.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.825
Doing what?

27:22.217 --> 27:23.717
Landscaping?

27:23.815 --> 27:25.409
Skimming the pool?

27:25.455 --> 27:28.077
Okay, moaching.

27:28.507 --> 27:29.999
Decorating.

27:30.036 --> 27:31.958
Breaking and entering.

27:32.177 --> 27:33.473
You don't understand.

27:33.526 --> 27:37.515
Is that because you think i make $12 an hour with no benefits, i'm an idiot?

27:37.793 --> 27:40.122
Or maybe because you think i'm black?

27:40.182 --> 27:41.727
Guess what, I'm Dominican.

27:41.758 --> 27:43.959
Really?
-Let's go.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.330
I'm here to see Emma Cooney.

27:45.376 --> 27:46.205
Who?
-Emma Cooney.

27:46.234 --> 27:47.720
You're here to see me?

27:47.845 --> 27:49.283
Yes!

27:50.172 --> 27:51.414
Hi, glad to see you.

27:51.466 --> 27:55.942
Vince.. Ben Roberts, Family Quality Publishing.

27:55.956 --> 27:59.589
You're gonna meet my partner Vince on Monday, yes..
-Yes.

27:59.714 --> 28:00.915
Of course.

28:00.946 --> 28:04.339
I got a little place down the beach,
310 Hampton Road..

28:04.414 --> 28:06.629
Come buy for a sunset cocktail.

28:07.003 --> 28:09.785
I'd love to, but i've only just arrived.

28:09.806 --> 28:12.634
I look forward to meeting Vince on Monday..

28:12.873 --> 28:15.767
If you're here tonight,
do say hello.

28:16.151 --> 28:17.968
Ta..
-Ta!

28:19.048 --> 28:20.338
Da.. See?

28:20.375 --> 28:22.365
She said if i'd..
Not invite.

28:22.402 --> 28:23.111
Go.

28:30.261 --> 28:32.386
You better get the guys to this party.

28:32.425 --> 28:36.590
They are in for the shock of their lives.

28:36.649 --> 28:37.916
Done, i am there.

28:37.953 --> 28:42.239
Hey, Hugh right now is banging cougar.
He's banging cougar right now.

28:46.398 --> 28:48.314
What are we gonna tell Hugh?

28:49.443 --> 28:50.913
What's that noise?

28:51.327 --> 28:53.047
What noise?
-Did you hear that?

28:56.338 --> 28:58.811
When are you gonna stop this gay masquarade?

28:58.848 --> 29:01.395
There are straight 500 designers.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.362
Now can you let me make the bed?

29:03.400 --> 29:07.369
It's a shame nobody sees you for the man you really are.

29:07.408 --> 29:12.049
Every woman wants to believe she's got the magic to turn a gay man straight.

29:12.147 --> 29:15.394
Owen, is that you.
-Admit it, you shit.

29:15.431 --> 29:18.437
I want more down, it's disgusting.

29:18.482 --> 29:20.834
It's like chicken feathers.
-Owen!

29:21.247 --> 29:22.310
Kate!

29:22.370 --> 29:24.043
What are you doing here?

29:24.081 --> 29:26.865
I told you i would call you Monday,
the house is not ready for you to see yet.

29:26.949 --> 29:28.313
Who's this?
-Who are you?

29:28.328 --> 29:29.376
Who are they?
-What's going on?

29:29.383 --> 29:31.101
Who's asking?
-No more questions.

29:32.209 --> 29:35.766
I am Owen Manners, i am Kate's personal lifestylers..

29:35.789 --> 29:38.184
Kate, shoo shoo, your hair is a disaster.

29:38.215 --> 29:41.267
Look at this flyaway, my god you need some hair serum.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.768
Nice to meet you,
how are you?

29:44.078 --> 29:45.766
This is Gabriella.
She is..

29:45.796 --> 29:47.681
Benny's houseguest.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.327
Benny?

29:50.380 --> 29:52.727
So, this is what Benny had in mind.

29:52.757 --> 29:55.215
A threesome with this chiquita.

29:59.655 --> 30:02.217
Global warming in this room
is affecting my chi.

30:02.254 --> 30:03.908
Ciao!

30:04.587 --> 30:07.051
I'm gonna call Benny right now..

30:07.066 --> 30:09.416
We're gonna sort this out.

30:09.492 --> 30:12.250
Fine, it's his house.
-It's my house!

30:13.064 --> 30:15.803
He told me i could stay here
to write my book.

30:15.841 --> 30:17.672
You're a writer?
-Yes.

30:18.509 --> 30:21.096
Like John Gris-ham.

30:23.885 --> 30:24.971
Right.

30:24.993 --> 30:28.465
I'm sure she thinks the thesaurus is a dinosaur.

30:31.495 --> 30:32.809
Hello?
-Hi Ben.

30:32.847 --> 30:34.889
Kate, hey baby. Hi.

30:34.933 --> 30:37.345
Do you have a woman staying in my house?

30:37.368 --> 30:40.676
And before you lie, i'd like to remind you
that i'm here right now.

30:40.737 --> 30:43.706
And she's right in front of me.

30:44.768 --> 30:47.322
I know you will never believe this by looking at her..

30:47.359 --> 30:51.024
But she's a very talented writer.
She has this great idea for a book.

30:51.054 --> 30:54.135
And because the business is running on fume,
In advance..

30:54.180 --> 30:56.910
I thought she can stay at the house for free while she writes.

30:56.948 --> 31:00.422
And at the same time, housesit,
as to protect your investment.

31:00.618 --> 31:02.579
And as for not telling you..

31:02.677 --> 31:04.365
Quite honestly i forgot.

31:05.519 --> 31:08.121
You know, keys and glasses you forget..

31:08.490 --> 31:12.998
A Brazillian bombshell staying in the master bedroom of your girlfriend's house, you don't forget!

31:13.057 --> 31:15.641
Don't you think that if i knew that if you were going there..

31:15.692 --> 31:17.720
I would call her and tell her to leave?

31:18.189 --> 31:19.215
This is not over.

31:19.267 --> 31:20.842
I love me my Kate.
Your my Kate.

31:20.873 --> 31:22.320
Is Vince there yet?

31:22.538 --> 31:24.626
We're definitely gonna talk about this.

31:30.809 --> 31:32.587
There's nothing going on.

31:34.245 --> 31:37.757
I actually think it's her cheating on me,
but she puts me on the defense, weird.

31:38.233 --> 31:40.509
First i get that crazy sextext..

31:40.546 --> 31:42.685
And that brand new dress she never worn..

31:42.723 --> 31:44.772
And my sex maniac partner goes to the hamptons..

31:44.788 --> 31:48.638
To figure out our business, and at the same time
she's there and i can't get a hold of them?

31:50.289 --> 31:51.956
Are you saying something, young man?

31:51.978 --> 31:54.314
He is a three time loser.

31:54.352 --> 31:57.901
His business is going under,
his girl is two-timing him..

31:57.930 --> 32:01.735
And on top of it all,
his partner is stuping her.

32:01.766 --> 32:03.928
That's certainly one interpretation.

32:09.136 --> 32:11.142
So here's where you've been hiding.

32:11.734 --> 32:13.400
What's smell like burn cat hair?

32:13.430 --> 32:14.892
You gotta go.

32:15.156 --> 32:18.322
My husband would murder you.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.206
Your husband?

32:20.327 --> 32:21.954
You're married?

32:27.001 --> 32:28.486
I knew it.

32:28.524 --> 32:30.649
Writer my ass.

32:30.679 --> 32:32.367
That liar!

32:33.611 --> 32:35.661
Where are my pants?

32:35.930 --> 32:38.137
They were right here.

32:38.447 --> 32:40.007
Cameron!

32:40.534 --> 32:43.067
Wait, i'll find you some clothes.
-You see this?

32:44.243 --> 32:45.562
Where are my clothes?

32:45.600 --> 32:46.578
All burned up.
-How?

32:46.623 --> 32:49.382
No time for explanations.
-That bastard is cheating on me.

32:49.434 --> 32:50.909
I need pants.

32:50.932 --> 32:54.512
He's on his way.
-No, your husband can't come.

32:54.550 --> 32:56.238
I'm naked.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.790
Oh my god.

33:12.910 --> 33:15.645
Shit. He looks mean.

33:16.059 --> 33:17.520
Fuck.

33:22.735 --> 33:24.649
Your husband is here.

33:24.680 --> 33:25.674
What?

33:30.951 --> 33:34.034
Vince is at the door.
-Good, let him in, i'll ask him how long Ben's been banging the bimbo.

33:34.071 --> 33:35.722
Come on.

33:54.621 --> 33:55.910
No, this way.

33:55.939 --> 33:57.658
This way!

34:05.833 --> 34:07.259
This is great.

34:07.304 --> 34:09.518
Where did baby Huey go?
-Stop it.

34:09.643 --> 34:11.704
He just looks young.

34:16.574 --> 34:18.710
You're here, hi.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.378
Didn't hear you come in.

34:20.416 --> 34:22.476
You are beautiful.

34:22.514 --> 34:25.190
God damn, you find the place okay?

34:25.547 --> 34:27.301
Who the hell are you?

34:27.530 --> 34:28.896
I'm Vinnie.

34:29.179 --> 34:32.146
Are you not Jannie, my naughty craiglist hottie?

34:32.193 --> 34:33.905
I'm calling the police.

34:33.980 --> 34:35.978
Relax, anybody's calling the police, it's me.

34:36.016 --> 34:37.880
Ben didn't tell me anybody was staying here.

34:37.918 --> 34:41.001
He didn't tell that circus was coming to town either.

34:41.068 --> 34:43.525
Sounds hinky, i'm Ben's partner.

34:43.563 --> 34:45.317
And that sounds hinky to me.

34:45.353 --> 34:48.937
If you were Ben's partner,
you should know i'm here.

34:49.897 --> 34:51.413
The bastard's cheating on me.

34:51.471 --> 34:53.433
That bastard's cheating on you.

34:53.471 --> 34:55.205
I'm gonna circumsized him.

34:53.471 --> 34:55.205
.

35:23.152 --> 35:26.101
This is exaclty why Vince and i
have an open relationship.

35:26.148 --> 35:29.118
Then why are we hiding in the boathouse?

35:29.523 --> 35:31.896
Maybe he's having an affair too.

35:32.439 --> 35:36.884
No, Vince would never, rule number 4 remember?
Always an away game.

35:37.009 --> 35:38.966
But you're here.

35:39.802 --> 35:41.273
I didn't think of that.

35:41.310 --> 35:44.479
Never mind about you,
i am getting even..

35:44.501 --> 35:45.654
Tonight.

35:45.857 --> 35:49.022
To think, i could have hooked up with Matt at the party, but i said no.

35:49.148 --> 35:52.070
You would not even cheat on a math test.

35:52.107 --> 35:54.715
I can just see you dining on Wiener and Balls.

35:55.151 --> 35:56.855
No, i'm doing it.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.447
Even if it's Owen.

36:00.201 --> 36:01.954
Owen's gay.

36:02.746 --> 36:04.238
Not tonight he's not.

36:21.641 --> 36:23.441
Kate?

36:24.518 --> 36:25.981
Gaby?

36:26.395 --> 36:28.241
Vince?
-Hey!

36:28.339 --> 36:29.864
Don't do that!
-Do what?

36:29.931 --> 36:32.124
Is she here?
-Oh yeah.

36:32.185 --> 36:35.332
No, she's not, but why are you holding out on me?

36:35.574 --> 36:37.458
Is Kate here?

36:37.526 --> 36:41.461
No, you can stop acting like all freaked out now, okay?

36:41.529 --> 36:43.450
She's gone.

36:45.010 --> 36:46.412
Did you talk to Emma Cooney yet?

36:46.442 --> 36:48.078
Of course, relax.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.946
She couldn't been more pleasant.
-That's great.

36:49.977 --> 36:51.339
When do we meet?
-Tonight at the party.

36:51.384 --> 36:52.853
SHe invited you?

36:52.967 --> 36:53.826
Not exactly.

36:53.946 --> 36:55.642
But she gave you an invitation?

36:55.767 --> 36:57.089
Not exactly.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.460
But you're on the list?

36:58.845 --> 36:59.997
Not exactly.
-Stop it.

36:59.998 --> 37:01.262
How are we going to the party?

37:01.263 --> 37:03.185
I don't know about you,
but i'm crashing.

37:11.765 --> 37:14.018
Vincy Wincey!

37:17.159 --> 37:19.134
I'm Vince.
-Oh my God!

37:19.224 --> 37:20.596
Yes!

37:21.765 --> 37:24.418
And you brought a friend.
-My best friend Wendy!

37:24.433 --> 37:25.983
Hello.

37:26.029 --> 37:27.316
Since we never see each other..

37:27.354 --> 37:28.916
I didn't know if you're gonna be like a creep..

37:28.959 --> 37:31.560
Or one of those gadget predator freaks
or whatever..

37:31.597 --> 37:32.976
I'm no creep.

37:33.006 --> 37:34.521
He doesn't look like a creep.

37:34.605 --> 37:36.029
Come on, this is Ben.

37:36.066 --> 37:38.145
Vince told me.

37:38.190 --> 37:40.519
You're the guy with the women problem.

37:40.534 --> 37:42.230
Poor little fella.

37:42.283 --> 37:44.580
Your casa is tight..

37:44.597 --> 37:47.204
We are gonna have mad fun.

37:48.557 --> 37:51.730
Excuse me, what are you doing inviting the Jersey Shore in here?

37:51.760 --> 37:53.579
Kate's already think i'm cheating with gaby.

37:53.624 --> 37:56.164
Aren't you?
-No, of course not.

37:56.216 --> 37:57.550
Why  not?

37:57.573 --> 38:02.033
The fact that you're hiding Gaby from Kate mean subconsiencely, you want something to happen.

38:02.101 --> 38:04.081
Hold on, just because you have a screw up relationship, doesn't mean..

38:04.118 --> 38:05.687
I'll stop you right there.

38:05.715 --> 38:08.609
I love my wife..

38:08.647 --> 38:12.283
I'd die for her, do not judge what you don't understand.

38:12.408 --> 38:14.695
Yo Vinnie, when are we going to the beach?

38:14.725 --> 38:16.225
Very soon.

38:16.270 --> 38:19.977
I just don't get how you're fine with your wife banging every swinger in a tri-state area.

38:20.007 --> 38:21.912
You think Cam has fooled around?

38:21.943 --> 38:23.518
Cam is a shopper.

38:23.571 --> 38:25.690
The way to get her off
is to yell Sale.

38:32.396 --> 38:36.486
Honestly Vince, is the Emma Cooney thing bolt
so you can have your little..

38:37.820 --> 38:39.168
Vince Gone Wild weekend?

38:39.198 --> 38:40.669
Vin, where can we put our stuff?

38:40.692 --> 38:42.899
Upstairs, but first..

38:42.915 --> 38:46.320
Who wants martinis?
Only they won't be tinies..

38:46.554 --> 38:48.581
He's so ready.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.053
Get them out of here right now.

38:50.076 --> 38:51.915
I can't.
-Why not?

38:51.938 --> 38:54.502
They are our ticket into the party.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.819
Martinis are nice,
but mojitos are nicer.

39:02.985 --> 39:05.020
Go, go!

39:05.145 --> 39:07.005
Shuh..

39:07.254 --> 39:09.364
Bad, bad..

39:10.371 --> 39:12.120
Did baby Hugh go home to mommy?

39:12.135 --> 39:13.703
Stop it with the baby jokes.

39:13.733 --> 39:15.886
He told me he was 24.

39:18.073 --> 39:19.646
That's gross.

39:19.771 --> 39:21.124
Why did you get a dog?

39:21.176 --> 39:22.894
Sorry.

39:31.405 --> 39:33.507
Why me?

39:40.843 --> 39:45.108
See that?
Would you look at that? Is that beautiful?

39:48.833 --> 39:50.664
What?
-Nothing.

39:50.867 --> 39:52.289
The beach!

39:52.350 --> 39:54.189
We need sunbathing.

39:54.314 --> 39:56.219
Oh my God, you are bad.

39:56.257 --> 40:00.174
You're bad.
-You're bad.
-Ladies, you're both bad.

40:02.238 --> 40:05.267
He is so tomorrow's obituary.

40:09.685 --> 40:11.705
God damn it.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.759
You girls have lovely tan.

40:13.789 --> 40:16.382
We got them dyed in..

40:16.471 --> 40:18.428
Turks and Cacos.

40:18.465 --> 40:20.448
I love to dye for konk..

40:21.699 --> 40:23.246
Me too.

40:24.776 --> 40:26.630
I don't get it.

40:27.082 --> 40:28.832
What about your open relationship?

40:28.861 --> 40:31.055
It's just slammed shut.

40:38.446 --> 40:39.966
Cameron, i don't understand.

40:40.018 --> 40:41.715
I thought that you agreed to this.

40:41.730 --> 40:43.132
I did, but..

40:43.915 --> 40:46.371
It's only because i didn't want to lose him.

41:03.206 --> 41:05.676
Benjamin, thank you.
Thank you.

41:05.801 --> 41:07.130
Thank you.

41:07.621 --> 41:09.179
This is 3, you need one.

41:09.224 --> 41:11.221
Make a fourth, please.
-I need that one.

41:11.259 --> 41:12.872
Before Vince and i got married..

41:12.895 --> 41:15.220
I knew he was wild and..

41:15.258 --> 41:16.735
Unpredictable.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.423
How do i love him, right?

41:18.548 --> 41:22.377
I guess i kinda thought if i let him be with
other women afterwards..

41:22.400 --> 41:23.938
He'd..

41:24.063 --> 41:26.668
He'd realized that i'm the only one he wants.

41:34.430 --> 41:35.786
You've never done it.

41:36.879 --> 41:38.537
You can't do it.

41:39.615 --> 41:41.815
You're a monogamous.

41:42.810 --> 41:44.430
How about some music, Benny?

41:44.452 --> 41:46.002
We need music.

41:46.019 --> 41:47.842
Music, can you put the music on, Ben?

41:48.347 --> 41:50.458
There you go, music.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.435
Come on, come on.

41:53.481 --> 41:55.410
I got some moves to show you.

41:55.433 --> 41:57.620
I got some moves to show you..

42:07.069 --> 42:08.810
Come on ladies, let's get you upstairs.

42:08.869 --> 42:11.312
Come on, let's go.

42:15.393 --> 42:16.673
Hell no!

42:17.961 --> 42:19.521
Your room, ladies..

42:19.603 --> 42:21.277
Oh, there's only one bed.

42:21.322 --> 42:22.576
That's okay.

42:22.606 --> 42:24.068
We can sleep together.

42:24.107 --> 42:26.217
Why didn't i think of that?

42:28.282 --> 42:29.645
Go away, dog.

42:29.676 --> 42:31.831
Stop it..

42:37.318 --> 42:39.849
Keys, keys, where did she put those keys?

42:43.751 --> 42:45.666
Wait, what?

42:45.689 --> 42:48.145
I don't mean to get all uptight, and judgey..

42:48.198 --> 42:49.855
Or anything, i just..
-It's all good.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.310
I'm not you, man.

42:51.355 --> 42:54.415
I can't sign up for the Vince's idiot Guide to a marriage.

42:54.445 --> 42:56.707
I didn't mean that,
that came out wrong.

42:57.618 --> 43:01.670
I'm just saying, if Kate cheated on me..

43:02.273 --> 43:04.353
I'd consider killing myself.
-No!

43:04.933 --> 43:07.102
Any pricks doing your old lady would be dead meat, alright?

43:07.132 --> 43:09.506
You're my boy, Ben.
I'd go Goodfellas on them.

43:09.528 --> 43:10.868
Mid-evil torture stuff?
-No.

43:10.891 --> 43:14.372
That's Pulp Fiction, get your movie straight.
I'm trying to be sincere, you're fucking it up.

43:14.583 --> 43:16.943
Not only do i got your back,
i'll take the boat out..

43:16.966 --> 43:18.676
And i'd cut that weasel up.

43:19.378 --> 43:20.996
I'm so..

43:21.561 --> 43:22.436
Fucked.

43:22.466 --> 43:24.327
Soprano style.
-Soprano style.

43:39.709 --> 43:41.554
Come on ladies, we want to be early.

43:41.584 --> 43:43.340
I'll stay here and wait for Kate.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.156
You do that, good luck.

43:45.282 --> 43:46.622
Bye bye Benny.

43:46.683 --> 43:49.184
We'll see you later, right?

43:51.980 --> 43:54.994
Don't worry, i'm gonna have Cooney signed
by the time i get back.

44:00.237 --> 44:02.150
Who doesn't have a door knob?

44:02.198 --> 44:05.507
How are you supposed to get out of the closet
when you're in the closet?

44:05.854 --> 44:08.453
Your chariot awaits.

44:10.382 --> 44:12.581
Come here.
-Oh, how sweet.

44:12.626 --> 44:14.449
He likes you.

44:16.044 --> 44:17.670
Somebody needs a doggy mint.

44:17.731 --> 44:19.328
Yes, you do.

44:19.358 --> 44:22.750
I'm gonna die over cougars.

44:28.574 --> 44:30.888
You must think i'm pretty stupid, huh?

44:30.918 --> 44:32.116
No..

44:32.214 --> 44:33.013
No.

44:33.020 --> 44:34.898
I think you're a woman in love.

44:36.677 --> 44:38.161
Let's just go home.

44:38.199 --> 44:40.851
No, we're going to the Dolce Vita Ball.

44:40.918 --> 44:42.530
Okay?
Come on.

44:42.989 --> 44:45.166
Let's go, you'll have fun.

44:45.506 --> 44:47.187
Come on.

44:50.924 --> 44:52.741
Oh crap.

44:53.720 --> 44:54.445
Cameron?

44:54.476 --> 44:57.317
Hugh was our ticket to the party,
how are we gonna get in?

44:57.875 --> 45:00.967
The old fashion way, baby.

45:01.524 --> 45:02.806
Damn.

45:02.836 --> 45:04.879
This is the new you.

45:05.004 --> 45:08.428
Let's freaking do it, we got 3 hours til this party starts.

45:08.458 --> 45:12.242
So, let's whore up, baby..

45:19.074 --> 45:21.267
I'd die a virgin.

45:22.452 --> 45:26.159
Those Jersey Girls, who likes fake tits?
Nobody.

45:28.462 --> 45:31.876
i have nothing to wear,
i'm not even wearing my good panties.

45:31.907 --> 45:33.619
Why wear any?

45:33.657 --> 45:36.589
Let's steal some of that Brazillian bimbo's clothes.

45:36.626 --> 45:39.510
No, i would never..
-I'll wear something of hers..

45:39.564 --> 45:41.937
And you can wear my new dress.
-No.

45:42.186 --> 45:45.013
How do you not work and afford such expensive clothes?

45:45.051 --> 45:47.674
I can't, Vince may have his 10 rules..

45:47.704 --> 45:48.848
But i've got 1.

45:48.878 --> 45:50.573
The wife shopping code of conduct.

45:50.596 --> 45:54.704
Bang him into that credit card, mortgage,
maternity, whatever it takes.

45:54.733 --> 45:56.602
Too confession of a shopaholic.

45:56.633 --> 45:58.652
Til death do you part.

45:59.394 --> 46:01.933
You know what?
Let's get this party started.

46:01.979 --> 46:04.589
I am gonna get us some shots.
-Okay, i'm gonna take a bath.

46:14.278 --> 46:17.715
I didn't even get to see them make out.

46:20.729 --> 46:22.643
Bad idea.

46:29.552 --> 46:32.017
Short cut..

46:32.055 --> 46:33.371
This is so thrilling.

46:33.417 --> 46:35.173
It's like adventure.

46:35.204 --> 46:36.718
It should be right here.

46:36.824 --> 46:40.207
I still have so much to do, and you're dragging me up.
The party stars at 2 hours.

46:40.228 --> 46:44.103
There's no way i'm taking a shower with that pervert,
i'll be quick.

46:44.473 --> 46:46.048
Dwayne!
-Yes sir.

46:46.071 --> 46:48.290
I have to help Miss Shorbin pick up an outfit.

46:48.334 --> 46:50.197
She needs a man's touch.

46:51.530 --> 46:52.894
Don't we all?

46:53.956 --> 46:57.317
Be careful with that, please.
And move that fucking tree!

47:01.413 --> 47:04.172
Aren't you a little old to be playing
hide and seek?

47:04.254 --> 47:06.164
Ha ha.. Very funny.

47:06.231 --> 47:08.786
What did you do?
Bite the head off something?

47:09.625 --> 47:11.005
Oh God.

47:11.201 --> 47:13.552
Shit!

47:14.102 --> 47:16.996
Stop it, Hugh!
You're not wearing this dress, it's for Kate.

47:17.043 --> 47:19.002
I'm tired of being naked.

47:19.046 --> 47:21.193
Please, i'm begging you.

47:24.179 --> 47:26.694
I told you this was a good shortcut.

47:26.715 --> 47:28.879
Ladies, you go work your magic..

47:28.910 --> 47:31.595
And tell him your Vincy Wincy is on his way.
-Okay.

47:44.600 --> 47:47.861
Hurry up, let's go chop-chop,
let's get it.

47:47.898 --> 47:50.190
Thank you, thank you,
whoa!

47:50.235 --> 47:51.273
Where are you going?

47:51.398 --> 47:53.944
I'm with the ladies, they put me on the list.

47:54.069 --> 47:55.213
I don't think so.
-Just now.

47:55.258 --> 47:57.888
They did tell me they expect a Vincy Wincy though..

47:57.971 --> 48:00.184
But not a little sneaky snake named Ben.

48:00.223 --> 48:02.084
If i see you again, i'm calling the cops.

48:02.153 --> 48:03.486
You got that.

48:04.120 --> 48:06.185
White people get locked up too.

48:08.688 --> 48:11.536
Please hurry, if Fields finds out i left,
he's gonna kill me.

48:11.574 --> 48:15.260
For once, can you think of someone
other than your paycheck?

48:16.517 --> 48:17.527
Hey.
-Hey.

48:17.557 --> 48:19.027
Look who i found.

48:19.222 --> 48:20.873
Feathers, nice..

48:20.919 --> 48:22.930
Pants will be better.

48:22.960 --> 48:26.698
How the hell did i become a naked man trying to escape?

48:26.823 --> 48:29.752
I've begun questioning many things myself.

48:29.797 --> 48:31.667
Cheers.
-Thanks.

48:31.727 --> 48:33.805
Crazy bitches.

48:34.732 --> 48:37.258
Here, don't you dare leave without me.

48:37.287 --> 48:39.781
Hurry up please.
-I will.

48:40.030 --> 48:41.478
Ladies..

48:41.726 --> 48:42.811
I'm out of here.

48:42.849 --> 48:45.093
No no..

48:45.138 --> 48:46.992
You promised to take us to that party.

48:47.006 --> 48:49.283
And that's exactly what you're gonna do.

48:49.375 --> 48:53.247
You know what, i think Vince has some clothes,
why don't you go in there and find some of his?

48:53.269 --> 48:54.942
I'll help you.

48:56.699 --> 48:59.653
You know what? I'm gonna get a shower, okay?
-Okay.

49:05.320 --> 49:07.046
Oh shit.

49:07.137 --> 49:09.624
Shit! Shit!

49:13.724 --> 49:17.206
Hey Mattie, it's me Kitty Kate.

49:17.820 --> 49:20.692
Gaby, i'm dying!

49:21.678 --> 49:23.158
Who the hell are you and
why are you drinking my beer?

49:23.241 --> 49:25.871
You must be the perv.

49:29.762 --> 49:32.340
Cameron..
-I'm in the shower.

49:32.529 --> 49:33.673
Mind if i come in?

49:33.710 --> 49:36.205
So, change of plans.
I'm in the Hamptons.

49:36.235 --> 49:38.129
And i would love to see you.

49:38.190 --> 49:40.578
Please hurry, if i don't get to the party..

49:40.594 --> 49:42.227
Field's going to castrate me.

49:42.249 --> 49:43.320
You're going to the party?

49:43.342 --> 49:45.648
Honey, i am the party.

49:45.723 --> 49:48.844
Man buddy, you gotta get me in.
I will do anything.

49:50.864 --> 49:53.557
Almost anything.

49:53.682 --> 49:55.012
No.

49:55.297 --> 49:59.307
Gaby, come on!
I'm dying!

49:59.857 --> 50:01.251
Owen?

50:09.416 --> 50:10.780
Ben?

50:10.856 --> 50:11.979
What are you doing up there?

50:12.031 --> 50:13.824
Looking for a cellphone service.

50:13.854 --> 50:15.321
Help me, dude.

50:15.705 --> 50:17.928
Gaby, it's time to go.

50:18.053 --> 50:20.016
Gaby, i'm getting old waiting for you.

50:20.076 --> 50:22.684
Make love to me.
-What?

50:25.704 --> 50:27.392
Owen?

50:28.485 --> 50:29.668
Come on, baby.

50:29.743 --> 50:32.015

51:31.513 --> 51:33.629

51:49.687 --> 51:51.435
Your homosexual..

51:51.496 --> 51:53.723
Bixesual fling?

51:55.838 --> 51:57.454
I'm disappointed in you.

51:58.715 --> 52:01.491
Ben! hey buddy, wait up!

52:01.504 --> 52:02.830
Slow down!

52:05.195 --> 52:06.703

52:06.727 --> 52:08.360
Get out, what are you doing?
-Okay!

52:08.401 --> 52:09.825
Where are you going?
-To Field's.

52:09.879 --> 52:10.958
I'll close Cooney myself.

52:10.988 --> 52:14.516
How are you gonna get in?
-With a little novelty called the truth.

52:14.561 --> 52:15.631
Would you please put a shirt on?

52:15.654 --> 52:18.993
I hate you! Get out!

52:19.118 --> 52:20.217
Have you seen Owen?

52:20.262 --> 52:22.101
You're phony french phony!

52:22.131 --> 52:24.496
Your lifestylist is upstairs..

52:24.518 --> 52:27.548
Having an identity crisis with my best friend's fiance.

52:29.129 --> 52:31.360
Okay, okay!

52:34.929 --> 52:37.695
I don't believe this,
this doesn't make sense.

52:37.820 --> 52:40.130
I swear to God, i'm gonna kick his puffy ass.

52:40.159 --> 52:41.742
You better be sure.

53:05.798 --> 53:07.946
Stop, get up!

53:07.998 --> 53:09.808
Get your boy jewels off me!

53:12.943 --> 53:14.895
It touched me!

53:14.932 --> 53:15.812
Who the hell is that?

53:15.857 --> 53:17.153
You travel with your own boy toy?

53:17.192 --> 53:17.983
Who is he?

53:18.028 --> 53:19.438
We weren't boinking,
we were hiding.

53:19.483 --> 53:20.832
Between his cheeks?

53:20.884 --> 53:22.340
I'm not into boys.

53:22.897 --> 53:25.037
Not that young anyway,
Gaby i wasn't with him, you know that.

53:25.091 --> 53:28.454
Yeah right, cause you're in there with that skinny bitch.

53:28.462 --> 53:29.554
Yeah, so?

53:29.563 --> 53:33.128
So what are you doing with her
when you are with me?

53:34.183 --> 53:36.180
It's just business!

53:38.130 --> 53:39.969
Christ, hear me!

53:40.423 --> 53:42.502
You're really hurting me!

53:44.993 --> 53:47.043
You're.. Ow!

53:47.805 --> 53:49.078
That really hurts!

53:49.116 --> 53:51.347
That was a bitchslapping.

54:08.308 --> 54:09.755
Get out of my house.

54:10.078 --> 54:11.919
What?
-You heard me, out!

54:12.227 --> 54:13.780
What's your problem?

54:16.378 --> 54:20.147
If it wasn't for you and your moronic open relationship..

54:20.200 --> 54:22.692
I wouldn't come down here
and safe your sorry ass..

54:22.744 --> 54:25.684
And stumble upon that slut and those condoms.

54:26.023 --> 54:28.701
Which force me to have an affair.

54:29.394 --> 54:30.713
With a gay man.

54:30.759 --> 54:35.966
So now, i'm the one who's being blamed for having an affair
when it's really Ben who's been cheating.

54:36.268 --> 54:39.494
So Ben breaks up with me,
and said it's my fault.

54:41.318 --> 54:44.183
But it's all your fault.

54:44.803 --> 54:49.966
It is not my fault your boyfriend is banging some Rio bimbo.

54:50.004 --> 54:53.867
Get out of my house,
i never want to see you again.

55:00.846 --> 55:03.257
Where are you going? I need you.
-I'm out of here, i'm leaving.

55:03.295 --> 55:06.428
Please, you have to tell Ben that nothing happened.
Please.

55:06.450 --> 55:07.890
Are you crazy? I quit.

55:07.906 --> 55:08.861
Expect my bill in the mail.

55:08.891 --> 55:11.454
Fine, Quit but please talk to Ben and
tell him nothing happened, please.

55:11.469 --> 55:15.021
Where the hell is my car? Gaby, damn it!

55:15.145 --> 55:17.840
My life is falling apart, and all anyone care about is this stupid girl.

55:17.877 --> 55:20.091
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

55:21.169 --> 55:22.518
Pardon me.

55:22.570 --> 55:24.455
I hope i'm not interupting anything.

55:24.469 --> 55:25.699
You're..

55:26.105 --> 55:27.341
Emma Cooney.

55:27.952 --> 55:29.951
Oh my God, i'm sorry.

55:29.989 --> 55:32.084
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

55:32.145 --> 55:34.195
Ben will be so pleased that you're here.
-There he is.

55:34.239 --> 55:35.253
Ben!

55:36.435 --> 55:37.875
Emma!

55:38.116 --> 55:39.517
Hi!

55:39.585 --> 55:40.684
Ben?

55:41.114 --> 55:43.315
Come in, come in..

55:43.721 --> 55:45.288
Welcome.

55:45.605 --> 55:48.874
So glad you can come,
isn't this nice?

55:48.911 --> 55:52.680
I assume that you've already met my lovely wife..

55:53.079 --> 55:55.512
Right here.
-Your wife?

55:56.077 --> 55:57.456
No..

55:58.052 --> 56:00.354
But you two..

56:00.479 --> 56:03.150
Don't be silly, he's teasing..

56:03.173 --> 56:05.235
No, i'm Cameron..

56:06.878 --> 56:09.645
I'm Vince's wife.

56:11.897 --> 56:14.022
You're Vince?

56:15.334 --> 56:19.206
You look nothing like how i'd imagine you
from your e-mails.

56:20.397 --> 56:22.407
But who looks like their e-mails?

56:26.776 --> 56:28.999
True..
-Nobody.

56:29.224 --> 56:30.687
Nobody.

56:32.065 --> 56:34.644
I hate to be a bother,
i just thought i'd..

56:34.683 --> 56:36.892
Take Ben up on his..

56:36.938 --> 56:40.636
Kind offer of a pre-gala libation.

56:40.666 --> 56:42.480
You like mojitos?
-I don't know.

56:42.524 --> 56:46.143
Let's discover now, please..

56:47.016 --> 56:47.949
I don't want to be Vince.

56:47.972 --> 56:49.396
Tough, you owe Ben this much.

56:49.510 --> 56:50.399
I don't owe him anything.

56:50.470 --> 56:54.091
You know what? I owe you a ball straight,
so if you ever want to collect.

56:55.786 --> 56:57.015
You got 15 seconds.

56:57.044 --> 56:58.962
You probably heard a tons of crazy stories today..

56:58.980 --> 57:01.022
But i'm gonna go a little different direction,
a little honesty.

57:01.065 --> 57:03.386
I'm not on the guestlist.

57:03.434 --> 57:05.251
I don't even like parties,
i don't want to be here..

57:05.293 --> 57:07.482
I just need to talk to Emma Cooney.

57:07.783 --> 57:09.109
You know Emma Cooney?

57:09.154 --> 57:10.173
Yeah.

57:10.764 --> 57:12.193
Ben Roberts.

57:12.892 --> 57:14.198
Ben Roberts?

57:14.276 --> 57:15.760
I know Ben Roberts.
-What?

57:15.801 --> 57:18.819
You're not him, you're just a sneaky snake trying to get into this party.

57:18.873 --> 57:20.671
I'm not a sneaky snake.
-Yes you are.

57:20.689 --> 57:22.617
But guess what,
i got something for you.

57:22.635 --> 57:23.606
Fellas.

57:25.166 --> 57:26.626
Get him!

57:29.266 --> 57:32.343
I love froggy the detective,
it was so..

57:33.386 --> 57:34.909
Moving.

57:35.545 --> 57:39.123
So, is your wife here Ben?
I'd love to meet her,

57:39.248 --> 57:42.325
Wife? No we're not married.

57:42.385 --> 57:44.586
They're not even engaged.

57:46.806 --> 57:48.156
Kate's upstairs.

57:48.185 --> 57:50.876
Look, there's Kate right now.

57:51.001 --> 57:52.770
You are here.

57:53.267 --> 57:56.506
Kate, meet Emma Cooney, the author.

57:56.769 --> 57:58.254
Nice to meet you, Kate.

57:58.298 --> 58:00.606
Lovely home you have here.

58:04.371 --> 58:05.479
Thank you.

58:05.509 --> 58:08.996
I thought it felt a bit gouched..

58:09.049 --> 58:11.830
Austintatious, new Vouge rich..

58:11.868 --> 58:14.357
No, i think it'll be lovely when it's finished.

58:14.372 --> 58:17.786
Do you think so?
I don't know.

58:18.701 --> 58:20.020
Katy.

58:21.588 --> 58:22.620
Vince.

58:22.688 --> 58:24.560
Drink up, Kate.

58:26.158 --> 58:27.394
You've got to be kidding me.

58:27.431 --> 58:28.794
So, Emma..

58:29.419 --> 58:30.693
Ben?

58:33.197 --> 58:34.735
Ben..

58:34.802 --> 58:36.860
Look who it is. It's..

58:37.275 --> 58:38.442
Owen.

58:38.711 --> 58:40.211
Yes, Owen.

58:40.256 --> 58:41.801
Our interior designer.

58:41.839 --> 58:43.924
He prefers lifestyler.

58:43.954 --> 58:45.221
Whatever.
-It doesn't matter.

58:45.243 --> 58:46.774
Owen Manners?

58:46.788 --> 58:49.931
What are you doing here?
Aren't you the wonderkid who's in charge of tonight's ball?

58:49.954 --> 58:51.488
Not for long.

58:51.613 --> 58:53.381
What the hell is going on?

58:53.506 --> 58:54.841
What are you guys doing?

58:55.063 --> 58:56.551
Who the fuck..

58:58.050 --> 58:59.830
Oh my God.. No way.

58:59.875 --> 59:02.110
Excuse us..

59:02.155 --> 59:04.665
Owen insists we go to the party.
-That's awesome.

59:04.740 --> 59:05.802
Kate, what is she doing here?

59:05.832 --> 59:07.458
Pay attention, Owen is Vince..

59:07.481 --> 59:10.501
Vince is you, I'm Cameron,
Cameron is me, go with it.

59:10.539 --> 59:11.511
What? Why?

59:11.534 --> 59:13.900
Because it's the only truth that'll make it work.

59:14.164 --> 59:15.136
Wait.

59:15.309 --> 59:17.803
If Owen is Vince,
and Vince is me..

59:18.074 --> 59:19.702
Does that mean that i'm..

59:20.433 --> 59:21.576
Yup.

59:21.629 --> 59:24.561
Do you want this Magical princess book or not?

59:24.659 --> 59:25.820
Go.

59:29.588 --> 59:30.604
Oh my God.

59:30.634 --> 59:33.242
Oh my God Emma Cooney,
i'm such a big fan of yours.

59:33.294 --> 59:35.231
I's so nice to meet you.
Give me your hands.

59:35.292 --> 59:36.784
I'm Owen.

59:40.176 --> 59:42.630
I'm so sorry, it went down the wrong..

59:42.719 --> 59:44.122
Hole.

59:46.593 --> 59:47.964
Let me get that for you.
Wait.

59:47.994 --> 59:49.133
There you go.
You look beautiful.

59:49.155 --> 59:50.452
Really big fans.

59:50.497 --> 59:53.261
We're huge fans.
-Right. Kate?

59:54.129 --> 59:57.519
Yes! Big fans!

59:59.837 --> 01:00:01.172
I'll get it.

01:00:01.217 --> 01:00:03.176
It's probably for me.

01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:05.018
Hello?

01:00:05.545 --> 01:00:06.556
Who?

01:00:06.774 --> 01:00:08.598
Hugh? What?

01:00:09.518 --> 01:00:11.771
How would i know if Hugh is banging cougars or not?

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:13.278
It doesn't make any sense.

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:19.888
Wrong number.

01:00:19.981 --> 01:00:21.706
Perhaps i should be going.

01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:24.342
Absolutely not, you can't go.
You should be sitting, you should be sitting down.

01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:28.382
I think i will join you, i'm just gonna go upstairs and freshen up.

01:00:28.835 --> 01:00:30.598
Please sit.
Come on.

01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:33.068
Come on.
-No?

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:34.236
Chips?

01:00:34.682 --> 01:00:37.554
So Emma, how's your new E-book?
Any popups in it?

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:39.868
Idiot.
-I'm so sorry.

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:43.687
So sorry. Ben, you publish electronic books, not porn.

01:00:43.718 --> 01:00:46.009
And we got spam blockers for the pop-ups.

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:47.651
The children will be safe.

01:00:49.113 --> 01:00:50.312
Hey, where are you going?

01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:52.114
To make up for lost times.

01:00:52.129 --> 01:00:54.525
Hey, why did you come down here
and spy on me anyway?

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:55.797
You know the rules.

01:00:55.843 --> 01:00:58.482
Maybe i cam down here to have a little fun myself.

01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:01.546
Did you ever think about that?

01:01:03.656 --> 01:01:05.296
That's what the phonecall was?

01:01:05.333 --> 01:01:07.368
And the naked kid in the bedroom?

01:01:07.406 --> 01:01:10.240
I'm gonna make sharkbait
out of your jailbait.

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:12.041
Owen was telling the truth.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:15.312
You came down here to rob the cradle, Mrs Robinson?

01:01:20.119 --> 01:01:22.108
Cammie, come on.
-Go away!

01:01:25.395 --> 01:01:27.226
You have a dog?

01:01:27.438 --> 01:01:29.037
Neighbor's.

01:01:30.755 --> 01:01:32.240
I'm sorry.

01:01:32.292 --> 01:01:33.698
Stop.

01:01:37.035 --> 01:01:38.512
Fucking dog.

01:01:38.888 --> 01:01:40.396
Shut up!

01:01:46.013 --> 01:01:48.013
I have a labradoodle.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:50.040
I named him Snoodle.

01:01:56.961 --> 01:01:58.620
Sshh.. Quiet.

01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:14.822
Motherfu...

01:02:14.947 --> 01:02:16.999
Christ's sake!
-Beg your pardon?

01:02:17.053 --> 01:02:18.477
Neighbor's dog's name.

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:20.309
is Christsake..

01:02:20.361 --> 01:02:21.965
Very religious.

01:02:22.327 --> 01:02:25.054
All we hear all day long is
Here, Christsake.

01:02:25.114 --> 01:02:27.982
Good, Christsake.
Come here, Christsake!

01:02:28.107 --> 01:02:30.876
Nice name, Christsake.

01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:33.519
God..

01:02:34.198 --> 01:02:35.630
No no..

01:02:37.622 --> 01:02:39.333
No, stop.

01:02:42.398 --> 01:02:44.341
Whoa!
-Oh my god, christsake!

01:02:44.395 --> 01:02:46.384
Where?

01:02:50.773 --> 01:02:54.295
I just love my wife, Cameron.

01:02:54.311 --> 01:02:56.217
That's lovely.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.603
No!

01:03:07.112 --> 01:03:08.868
No means no!

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.324
No!

01:03:13.058 --> 01:03:16.146
Darling, little tiny darling.
Can we talk outside for a second?

01:03:16.161 --> 01:03:17.510
If you insist.

01:03:18.188 --> 01:03:20.088
I love you.

01:03:22.168 --> 01:03:24.843
She's a pistol.

01:03:27.788 --> 01:03:30.511
She's a pistol.

01:03:35.336 --> 01:03:37.545
Yup, that's..

01:03:38.276 --> 01:03:40.113
She doesn't like children.

01:03:42.457 --> 01:03:43.844
I do.

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:54.799
Just because you've been servicing the queen,
doesn't mean you have to advertise it.

01:03:54.837 --> 01:03:56.953
I'm not having an affair with Owen.

01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:59.326
God, even your lies have lies.

01:03:59.364 --> 01:04:02.197
Our lies are honest.
-So why are you pretending to be me?

01:04:02.474 --> 01:04:04.155
there was this prick security guard..

01:04:04.283 --> 01:04:07.547
I didn't want Cooney to think i.. We..
We were stalking.

01:04:08.028 --> 01:04:09.251
I was winging it.

01:04:09.282 --> 01:04:10.126
What an idiot.

01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:14.093
Look who's preaching from the pulpit,
little miss shopping code of conduct.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.487
There's a code, what code?

01:04:15.501 --> 01:04:17.250
Shut up, Mr threeway!

01:04:17.376 --> 01:04:18.843
No, have you no shame!

01:04:18.881 --> 01:04:19.929
For christsake.

01:04:19.988 --> 01:04:21.745
He's not in here, dear.

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:25.291
Stop it.

01:04:25.322 --> 01:04:28.131
After tonight we can all just flip each other off..

01:04:28.161 --> 01:04:29.433
And go our merryways.

01:04:29.478 --> 01:04:32.725
But sitting out there is the only way to save your..

01:04:32.762 --> 01:04:35.717
Hanging by a thread business,
so i suggest..

01:04:35.763 --> 01:04:37.994
We all just suck it up..

01:04:38.119 --> 01:04:39.969
Put on your best phony faces..

01:04:40.157 --> 01:04:42.392
And lay the bullshit on that.

01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:48.386
Fine.

01:04:59.527 --> 01:05:01.569
Emma, what's the book about?

01:05:06.467 --> 01:05:08.322
I'll get it.
I get it.

01:05:10.385 --> 01:05:12.542
Hey.
-It's the cutie..

01:05:12.587 --> 01:05:15.544
What are you doing here?
-I just love your dog.

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:18.047
What is his name?

01:05:18.327 --> 01:05:19.803
Christsake!

01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:23.583
Sorry, i was just asking.

01:05:24.239 --> 01:05:26.385
Why don't you guys at the party?
It's already started.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.217
Come on.

01:05:28.254 --> 01:05:30.496
Yeah, you're missing a lot of good stuff.
Just head back.

01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:33.111
Yeah, good idea.
-I forgot my weed.

01:05:34.543 --> 01:05:36.383
Did she just say weed?

01:05:36.443 --> 01:05:37.966
No..

01:05:38.637 --> 01:05:40.959
We.. like the video game thing.

01:05:40.996 --> 01:05:42.436
They love games.

01:05:49.247 --> 01:05:50.890
Ladies, can you come back later?

01:05:50.928 --> 01:05:53.370
Cause they need the party and whatever you do..

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.559
Oh my God!

01:05:56.124 --> 01:05:58.890
No no..

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.758
Ladies, ladies, i'm begging you.

01:06:09.781 --> 01:06:11.650
Ladies, not now!

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:18.405
What the fuck..

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.902
The naked man..

01:06:22.195 --> 01:06:24.772
Best room service.

01:06:25.407 --> 01:06:27.209
Who the fuck are you?

01:06:27.334 --> 01:06:29.274
Someone's angry.

01:06:29.498 --> 01:06:32.046
You, crazy naked man.
Get out of here!

01:06:32.171 --> 01:06:33.440
Get out of here now!

01:06:33.471 --> 01:06:38.077
I'm gonna kill you!
-I swear, i didn't know she was married.

01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:39.374
Get off me!

01:06:39.498 --> 01:06:42.436
Sounds like an active game.

01:06:43.529 --> 01:06:44.755
Yeah.

01:06:46.043 --> 01:06:47.664
I'm gonna go..

01:06:47.997 --> 01:06:51.500
Check on the game real quick.

01:06:57.131 --> 01:07:00.206
Hey Vincy!

01:07:00.264 --> 01:07:01.538
What is this, Burning Man?

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.453
He must have escaped from hospital.

01:07:03.483 --> 01:07:05.460
Help me throw this guy off the balcony right now.

01:07:05.513 --> 01:07:07.661
Grab!
-You!

01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:10.155
I'll just see for myself.

01:07:11.893 --> 01:07:14.259
Oh my God!

01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:20.850
Help! They're doing things to me!

01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:22.680
Oh My God!
-Oh my God!

01:07:22.733 --> 01:07:25.115
Damn it.
-Oh my!

01:07:28.068 --> 01:07:29.553
Miss Cooney!

01:07:29.756 --> 01:07:31.444
Take this pill.

01:07:31.497 --> 01:07:34.819
I'm appauled.
You should all be ashamed of yourselves.

01:07:35.158 --> 01:07:37.409
Coming ladies?
-Yes.

01:07:39.015 --> 01:07:40.967
Get in, get in.

01:07:40.982 --> 01:07:43.432
No, no..
You're not getting in.

01:07:45.188 --> 01:07:47.153
Let me just squeeze in.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.430
Shit!

01:07:51.555 --> 01:07:53.194
Damn it!

01:07:57.344 --> 01:07:58.271
New plan.

01:07:58.294 --> 01:07:59.704
Stick a fork in it.

01:08:00.623 --> 01:08:01.778
It's done.

01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:04.829
2004.

01:08:04.859 --> 01:08:08.723
Greates comeback in sport's history,
Redsox down 3-0..

01:08:08.761 --> 01:08:11.774
3 outs from World Series Elimination,
facing Mariana Libera..

01:08:11.822 --> 01:08:14.026
Baseball's greatest closure,
did they quit?

01:08:14.064 --> 01:08:15.100
Hell no!

01:08:15.204 --> 01:08:17.596
As if things aren't bad enough..

01:08:17.721 --> 01:08:19.434
Now you're plugging the Redsox?

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:20.760
That's not the point.

01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:22.276
It's done!

01:08:22.917 --> 01:08:25.442
I just lost everything, Vince.

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:29.394
Fine, you stay here quitter.

01:08:29.478 --> 01:08:30.760
I'm gonna go do what i do.

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:33.453
Do what you do?
Let me tell you what you do.

01:08:34.221 --> 01:08:36.549
You sell bullshit.

01:08:36.586 --> 01:08:39.752
You are a bullshit salesman.

01:08:39.808 --> 01:08:43.129
You swore to me that E-publishing was the future..

01:08:43.255 --> 01:08:46.785
Paperless books, there's green in going green.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:48.232
Where's the green, Vince?

01:08:48.261 --> 01:08:51.031
At least i'm not afraid to try.

01:08:51.153 --> 01:08:53.564
You put your whole life on hold.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:57.595
You're just waiting for something to happen,
and it's passing you by, my friend.

01:08:57.707 --> 01:08:59.178
That's no bullshit.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:02.475
We're ready.
-Vinny, let's go go go.

01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:05.358
Ready to go to this party, ladies?

01:09:07.202 --> 01:09:10.743
They have house made entirely out of chocolate.

01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:20.908
Where's Owen?

01:09:20.984 --> 01:09:24.309
He left to select the Brazillian gir's ensemble.

01:09:24.318 --> 01:09:25.943
Says she needs a man's touch.

01:09:25.981 --> 01:09:27.626
Who doesn't.

01:09:27.707 --> 01:09:29.261
Where's Cooney?
-She left.

01:09:29.283 --> 01:09:30.979
Motherfucker!

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:34.206
Isn't anyone gonna be at my party?

01:09:34.221 --> 01:09:35.526
This is your fault.

01:09:35.555 --> 01:09:38.569
Once they're in,
they don't get out. Understood?

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.778
Yes sir.
-Unless i throw them out.

01:09:45.261 --> 01:09:47.946
Hey, woah woah..

01:09:47.997 --> 01:09:49.781
Stop, hey guys..

01:09:49.907 --> 01:09:51.334
You want a ride with us?

01:09:51.372 --> 01:09:52.716
YEs!

01:09:52.758 --> 01:09:55.545
Are we negotiating?
-I can't get you in, Dwayne knows what you look like.

01:09:55.586 --> 01:09:58.678
We got that covered, i just need you to help out for my friends here.

01:09:58.714 --> 01:10:01.040
Whatever, fine.

01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:30.617
Here's to be single,
seeing doubles..

01:10:30.639 --> 01:10:32.182
And sleeping triple.

01:10:32.219 --> 01:10:34.841
I'm Duncan.
ANd you are?

01:10:37.013 --> 01:10:38.923
How old are you?

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:40.591
Old enough.

01:10:44.871 --> 01:10:47.777
Man, things people do to get into a party, go.

01:10:47.989 --> 01:10:50.070
Don't let them play hard to get.

01:10:51.559 --> 01:10:53.905
Matt, it's me Kate.

01:10:53.953 --> 01:10:55.887
I'm here at the party, surprise.

01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:58.902
Where are you? Call me, i'm here, bye!

01:10:58.944 --> 01:11:00.524
Sorry, excuse me.

01:11:14.527 --> 01:11:17.310
Vince is not the only one who can crash the party.

01:11:49.796 --> 01:11:53.390
Welcome to the Dolce Vita Ball.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:58.139
The night belongs to you,
please enjoy it..

01:11:58.193 --> 01:12:00.316
Irresponsibly!

01:12:02.943 --> 01:12:05.571
Hey, fucking idiot.
You're gonna get killed out here.

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:07.277
Sorry, my bad!

01:12:42.957 --> 01:12:45.109
Wow, Vince..

01:12:45.234 --> 01:12:49.465
If this is the new you, i do not want to see you
going through my closet.

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:50.696
Yeah yeah.

01:12:50.726 --> 01:12:52.752
And..

01:12:52.818 --> 01:12:55.154
We need to talk about those 10 rules.

01:12:55.221 --> 01:12:56.861
What about them?

01:12:57.561 --> 01:12:59.811
They're too many.

01:13:09.889 --> 01:13:12.594
Attention, come on you free loaders!

01:13:12.605 --> 01:13:15.723
I will close this open bar..

01:13:16.048 --> 01:13:18.390
That got your attention.

01:13:18.757 --> 01:13:20.554
I am a man of few words.

01:13:20.579 --> 01:13:22.612
Most of those have 4 letters.

01:13:24.638 --> 01:13:26.472
Actually, i moved up to 7.

01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:28.172
Fuck you.

01:13:30.949 --> 01:13:35.367
It's not everyday that a fella gets to see
his boy become a man.

01:13:35.591 --> 01:13:38.141
Don't worry, it's not a surprise Barmitzvah.

01:13:39.619 --> 01:13:42.723
Tonight is my pride and joy's 18th birhtday.

01:13:42.777 --> 01:13:45.496
So belly up to the bar
and join me in a toast..

01:13:45.622 --> 01:13:46.888
To..

01:13:47.293 --> 01:13:48.709
Move your asses people!

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.337
Watch it!

01:14:02.996 --> 01:14:04.353
What the hell?

01:14:04.389 --> 01:14:05.923
Get off, get off me.

01:14:06.224 --> 01:14:08.177
This is one hell of a coming out party.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.166
Look at you.

01:14:09.177 --> 01:14:11.281
He's got a fucking dress.

01:14:11.324 --> 01:14:13.203
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:14:14.445 --> 01:14:15.959
That's my boy.

01:14:17.692 --> 01:14:19.978
Let's the fireworks begin!

01:14:24.066 --> 01:14:25.736
Mambo!

01:14:36.049 --> 01:14:38.226
You know you make me very proud, son.

01:14:38.311 --> 01:14:40.078
If you need someone to talk to..

01:14:40.121 --> 01:14:41.477
You should have come to me.

01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:44.259
That lipstick's shade is all wrong on you.

01:14:46.057 --> 01:14:47.913
For Christsake..

01:14:56.613 --> 01:14:58.102
Oh my God.

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.975
It's Benny Bunny.

01:15:00.198 --> 01:15:02.693
Skinny dipping!

01:15:30.645 --> 01:15:33.198
It's about to make perfect unity..
-I need your help.

01:15:33.263 --> 01:15:34.481
I'll talk to you in a second.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:35.494
Get away from me!

01:15:35.524 --> 01:15:37.713
You gotta distract Fields,
so i can talk to Emma.

01:15:37.754 --> 01:15:40.041
Has your tong cut the circulation to your brain?

01:15:40.071 --> 01:15:41.933
We negotiated, i got you in..

01:15:41.952 --> 01:15:43.169
I'm done, get away.

01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:46.238
I don't know why you take such immediate dislike to me.

01:15:46.364 --> 01:15:47.316
Save time..

01:15:47.353 --> 01:15:49.065
If you don't distract Fields..

01:15:49.101 --> 01:15:53.484
Even if it means taking one for the team,
i'm gonna out you for the phony homo that you are.

01:15:53.609 --> 01:15:55.053
Oh no.

01:15:57.187 --> 01:16:00.063
Bartender, we need something special for this beautiful lady.

01:16:00.111 --> 01:16:02.034
What do you like?
Cosmo?

01:16:02.239 --> 01:16:04.857
Mercedes, yatch?

01:16:04.869 --> 01:16:06.261
How about my watch?

01:16:10.925 --> 01:16:13.904
Eduardo, throw me another Robusto.

01:16:13.941 --> 01:16:15.883
Sure, Mr Jeffery.

01:16:16.008 --> 01:16:17.565
Owen..

01:16:20.545 --> 01:16:21.497
Magnificent job.

01:16:21.526 --> 01:16:23.625
I'm so glad you're thrilled.

01:16:23.812 --> 01:16:25.882
Thrilled? I'd poop myself.

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:28.421
He's so silly.

01:16:28.457 --> 01:16:30.529
If you like what i've done here..

01:16:30.854 --> 01:16:34.844
Just think what i'd do with your
New Year's eve bash.

01:16:34.904 --> 01:16:36.816
If the position is still open.

01:16:36.889 --> 01:16:38.582
The position is open.

01:16:38.602 --> 01:16:40.757
One of many positions i have in mind for you.

01:16:40.781 --> 01:16:42.787
Mr Fields, thank you so much.

01:16:42.836 --> 01:16:45.233
You won't be disappointed,
i promise.

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.447
It's strong..

01:16:48.572 --> 01:16:50.178
Thank you..

01:16:50.215 --> 01:16:51.437
Owen?

01:16:51.475 --> 01:16:53.755
It's true, you are in love with Jeffery Fields.

01:16:53.774 --> 01:16:54.707
Are you?

01:16:54.745 --> 01:16:56.732
He told me but i didn't believe him.

01:16:56.789 --> 01:17:01.258
To think i was a week away from the operation, bitch!

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.074
I can explain.
-No.

01:17:03.113 --> 01:17:06.022
You're letting your true feelings
bubble to the surface.

01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:08.443
No..
-No..

01:17:09.121 --> 01:17:11.373
Demure doesn't become you.

01:17:11.498 --> 01:17:13.267
Let's take a walk.

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.873
A break, fellas.

01:17:16.948 --> 01:17:19.426
Excuse us,
date with destiny.

01:17:30.392 --> 01:17:32.334
Would you like a 16 Stogey?

01:17:32.362 --> 01:17:34.604
Can you handle my things to you?

01:17:34.839 --> 01:17:37.505
Cigars, senorita.

01:17:38.937 --> 01:17:40.926
Don't tempt me.

01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:45.338
I haven't been honest with you.

01:17:45.377 --> 01:17:48.805
You will thank me for this in 7 minutes.

01:17:53.334 --> 01:17:55.953
So, you pretended to be your partner..

01:17:56.009 --> 01:17:58.167
Who pretended to be Owen.
-Yeah.

01:17:58.195 --> 01:17:59.973
Who pretends to be gay.
-Yeah.

01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:02.017
You lost your wife..
-Yeah.

01:18:02.055 --> 01:18:06.040
Ben lost his fiance, all because you want to publish my book?

01:18:06.165 --> 01:18:08.713
Yeah, we area really big fans.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.498
I'm sorry Vince, but i signed with Fields.

01:18:11.513 --> 01:18:13.985
Just before i arrived,
i only drop by to tell you..

01:18:14.007 --> 01:18:17.240
In person, because i thought it's the right thing to do.

01:18:30.909 --> 01:18:33.720
Fields, he has multimillion dollars deals in play.

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:35.074
We were talking happy meals..

01:18:35.097 --> 01:18:38.269
You left your old publisher because you were against all of that comercialness.

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.583
Stop being so bloody naive.

01:18:40.929 --> 01:18:44.239
I don't mind being exploited,
if i'm making money.

01:18:46.568 --> 01:18:49.008
And why should i be freezing my ass off in Sussex..

01:18:49.054 --> 01:18:51.413
When i could tan it in Marbella?

01:18:52.786 --> 01:18:54.648
Keep doing it for the love.

01:18:59.107 --> 01:19:00.509
Are you gay?
-No.

01:19:00.532 --> 01:19:02.506
Pretending to be gay?
-No.

01:19:02.536 --> 01:19:04.180
Bisexual?

01:19:04.232 --> 01:19:06.372
Never have the Bi yet.

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.558
Vince, did you close Cooney yet?
Please say yes..

01:19:09.596 --> 01:19:11.812
She sold out faster than the Ipad.
-No..

01:19:11.851 --> 01:19:14.894
She wants theme park rides
and soft drinks..

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:16.839
Probably hocking an infomercial right now.
-No..

01:19:16.877 --> 01:19:18.643
- No Vince, that's not okay.
- I know.

01:19:18.673 --> 01:19:20.882
Stop..
Oh no, oh shit.

01:19:21.003 --> 01:19:23.015
- We have a breach.
- I got to go.

01:19:23.143 --> 01:19:24.264
What?

01:19:31.006 --> 01:19:32.702
Oh my god..
Oh.

01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:35.356
Oh that's not good.
That is not good.

01:19:35.393 --> 01:19:37.934
Oh I didn't do that.
Okay, cool.

01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:40.520
- No.. Ah. Ah.
- Uh..

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:41.723
Look at you.
- Thank you.

01:19:41.746 --> 01:19:44.112
No, No if I could just..

01:19:44.324 --> 01:19:46.222
Oh God..
Oh..

01:19:46.334 --> 01:19:48.769
Oh.. You smell like apricots.

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:51.081
Just relax and do it.

01:19:51.104 --> 01:19:52.866
And vice versa.
- I..

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:57.227
Help, Mr Fields..

01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:58.810
That's my security ring.

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:01.483
Hello..

01:20:01.528 --> 01:20:02.907
Are you busy?

01:20:03.141 --> 01:20:04.565
Kinda busy.

01:20:04.973 --> 01:20:06.910
We have a security breach.

01:20:10.128 --> 01:20:11.964
Kate. Shh.. shh..

01:20:12.046 --> 01:20:13.396
Security is looking for me Kate.

01:20:13.433 --> 01:20:15.310
- Out of the bush.
- Be quiet.

01:20:15.371 --> 01:20:17.570
Why are you in Hamptons?
I'm serious, tell me the truth right now.

01:20:17.631 --> 01:20:20.773
Because like an idiot I thought I could safe Cameron from herself.

01:20:20.803 --> 01:20:22.411
- What?
- Ben, look at me.

01:20:22.456 --> 01:20:24.106
I'm not cheating on you.

01:20:24.232 --> 01:20:26.172
But..
- But what Kate?

01:20:26.232 --> 01:20:28.886
Who's XL condoms are in the bedroom?

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:32.652
You of all people now that I don't wear XL condoms.

01:20:32.691 --> 01:20:34.417
- Right.
- So what the hell's going on?

01:20:34.431 --> 01:20:38.224
We are way to sober to figure this out, can we go get a drink?

01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:43.783
- You take care of it?
- No sir Mr.Fields.

01:20:43.867 --> 01:20:46.504
If I am copulating I do not wish to be disturbed.

01:20:46.527 --> 01:20:48.464
Okay, I apologize sir.
Okay.

01:20:50.853 --> 01:20:51.757
Fuck!

01:20:51.882 --> 01:20:53.813
Two mojitos please.

01:20:54.551 --> 01:20:55.742
Cool party huh?

01:20:55.764 --> 01:20:57.525
Yeah, it's getting better.

01:20:59.959 --> 01:21:02.302
Got to get much better.

01:21:02.348 --> 01:21:04.421
Kitty Kate, how great?

01:21:04.488 --> 01:21:05.770
Kitty Kate?

01:21:05.815 --> 01:21:07.879
Wait, I'm sorry.
You two guys know each other?

01:21:07.947 --> 01:21:11.505
She was my high school prom date,
We were just laughing about it this morning.

01:21:11.776 --> 01:21:13.873
You have breakfast with her?

01:21:13.919 --> 01:21:15.705
You've already hooked up with the brazilian bimbo?

01:21:15.719 --> 01:21:18.002
I'm not a bimbo chikita, I'm a professional.

01:21:18.038 --> 01:21:19.833
- Oh there is no doubt you're a..
- Bitch!

01:21:19.848 --> 01:21:21.988
- Get off me. What the hell?
- Wow.. wow..

01:21:22.113 --> 01:21:24.235
Stop!
- Let go of my hand..

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.212
- Please..
- Ow..
- Get off me..
-Come on..

01:21:27.446 --> 01:21:30.019
- What the hell?
- I knew you were fucked up beyond believe.

01:21:30.366 --> 01:21:31.677
Gaby..

01:21:31.903 --> 01:21:32.966
Who the hell is this guy?

01:21:32.996 --> 01:21:34.745
I'm Matt, Who are y..

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:36.152
Are you Ben?

01:21:36.175 --> 01:21:39.099
- The pole vaulter?
- I can explain everything.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:41.095
Do still have feelings for him Kate?
- No.

01:21:41.109 --> 01:21:43.092
Ben you ask me for a 3-way.

01:21:43.138 --> 01:21:44.826
And you want one with him?
- No.

01:21:44.849 --> 01:21:46.932
But i would like someone to listen.

01:21:46.992 --> 01:21:48.823
Well why don't you just talk to me, Kate?

01:21:48.854 --> 01:21:51.424
- I'm gonna give you guys a minute.
- Great idea.

01:21:53.618 --> 01:21:55.437
I do know one thing.

01:21:55.563 --> 01:21:58.931
If a girl buys an expensive dress and doesn't wear it for her man..

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.247
That's the most expensive mistake of her life.

01:22:06.234 --> 01:22:08.390
Here, before you choose..

01:22:08.427 --> 01:22:11.637
Which life's path your gonna follow tonight..

01:22:11.762 --> 01:22:14.184
I'm gonna give you something to remember.

01:22:14.214 --> 01:22:16.754
And based on life's experience..

01:22:16.776 --> 01:22:21.441
Trust me it'll have a profound life altering affect.

01:22:25.095 --> 01:22:27.786
Wait, you're not married are you?

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.844
Before we....

01:22:50.005 --> 01:22:51.566
You know..

01:22:52.199 --> 01:22:54.564
My lady, I am not who you think I am.

01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:58.526
And I think you're masquerading as twikle toes' lifestylist Owen Manners.

01:22:58.565 --> 01:23:03.133
When in reality you're the Hampton's notorious seducing all the deperate housewives.

01:23:03.163 --> 01:23:05.855
All their husbands don't have a clue.

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.719
I am who you think I am.

01:23:12.642 --> 01:23:15.144
Am I who you think I am?

01:23:18.662 --> 01:23:19.687
Hey..

01:23:19.732 --> 01:23:21.896
Hey..
- I know you.

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:24.737
Yeah you're that polevaulter.

01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:27.956
- You're Kate's friend aren't you?
- Yes I am.

01:23:29.101 --> 01:23:31.120
- Want a shot?
- Yeah.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.591
It's good..

01:23:35.651 --> 01:23:36.834
Where is yours?

01:23:37.557 --> 01:23:39.020
Hey..

01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:43.649
Ah thank you very much..
Bottom's up, mister.

01:23:47.237 --> 01:23:50.174
There you are.. Where have you been?
- Hi ladies..

01:23:50.299 --> 01:23:51.735
We missed you.

01:23:51.758 --> 01:23:55.074
Want to see a surprise?
-Yeah.

01:24:23.248 --> 01:24:25.040
That's okay..

01:24:25.529 --> 01:24:29.562
It happens to old guys like all the time.

01:24:29.615 --> 01:24:32.050
We won't tell anyone, don't worry.

01:24:32.306 --> 01:24:34.460
Now we can take care of each other.

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:35.808
You can watch.

01:24:35.854 --> 01:24:38.913
It will be pay per view only free.

01:24:39.569 --> 01:24:41.447
- Poor thing.
- Yeah..

01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:07.644
I have been so stupid.

01:26:07.769 --> 01:26:09.535
No, I've been stupid.

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:13.517
I have not been making very good decisions lately.

01:26:14.259 --> 01:26:15.817
God..

01:26:16.317 --> 01:26:20.240
Can you believe that I came out here to hook up with Hugh?

01:26:20.912 --> 01:26:24.437
Didn't know whether I should hump him or burp him.

01:26:27.681 --> 01:26:29.489
And worst of all..

01:26:30.071 --> 01:26:33.153
I have hurt the person that I care most about.

01:26:34.052 --> 01:26:35.898
Vince will understand.

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.591
I'm talking about you.

01:26:41.553 --> 01:26:44.661
Well, I nearly made the same mistake with Matt.

01:26:45.116 --> 01:26:47.131
I mean at least you had fun with him, right?

01:26:47.148 --> 01:26:48.527
Oh my God.

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.272
Kate, I did not sleep with Matt, he's your ex.

01:26:52.296 --> 01:26:54.034
There is a girl code.

01:26:54.058 --> 01:26:57.716
It is small but it does exist.

01:26:58.392 --> 01:27:00.335
We just stayed up talking all night.

01:27:00.347 --> 01:27:03.434
- You're right he's a very good listener.
- That's good, yeah.

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:17.018
Vince ran off with the doinks sisters.

01:27:19.117 --> 01:27:21.568
Ben left with Gaby.

01:27:49.504 --> 01:27:50.649
I've been..

01:27:50.774 --> 01:27:52.337
I've been thinking our..

01:27:53.341 --> 01:27:54.566
Arrangement.

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.284
Yeah, you uhm..
