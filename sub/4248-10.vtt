WEBVTT

00:35.869 --> 00:40.039
TRUDY, WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.460
{\an1}WE DIDN'T MEAN TO GET YOU INTO
TROUBLE. HONESTLY WE DIDN'T.

00:43.543 --> 00:50.884
I KNOW. IT'S MY OWN FAULT FOR
BELIEVING YOUR SILLY STORIES.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.762
WE'RE GOING TO MISS YOU.

00:55.472 --> 00:59.517
{\an1}AND I'M GOING TO MISS YOU
TOO. ALL OF YOU.

00:59.601 --> 01:03.563
YOUR TAXI'S HERE.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.650
HOW CAN YOU
DO THIS?

01:07.734 --> 01:09.819
TRUDY HASN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.989
GOODBYE, TRUDY.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.096
UGH!

01:37.347 --> 01:39.349

TRUDY ALWAYS GAVE US TOAST,
WITH OUR CHOICE OF JAM AND,

01:42.435 --> 01:43.645
FORGET TRUDY.

01:43.728 --> 01:48.858
{\an4}AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY
COOKING, YOU CAN ALWAYS
DO IT YOURSELF.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.402
{\an5}HOW ABOUT WE GO AND GET
BREAKFAST FROM THE VENDING
MACHINES IN SCHOOL GUYS?

01:51.486 --> 01:54.781
(everybody) YEAH.

01:59.118 --> 02:02.372
{\an1}NO WAY! THEY'RE INSTALLING
SECURITY CAMERAS.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.291
{\an1}THEY CAN'T DO THAT. IT'S A
TOTAL INVASION OF OUR PRIVACY.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.377
AND THE CAMERA ADDS
TWENTY POUNDS!

02:07.460 --> 02:11.256
{\an4}THE SCHOOL IS ALWAYS STRIVING
TO IMPROVE YOUR PERSONAL
SECURITY.

02:11.339 --> 02:18.263
THIS IS OUR LATEST MEASURE TO
HELP YOU FEEL SAFE AND SECURE.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.850
- THIS IS A JOKE.
- SAFE AND SECURE?

02:23.476 --> 02:27.564
{\an4}I DIDN'T REALISE THERE WERE
SO MANY OPTIONS FOR A CAREER
IN SPORTS.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.107
IT REALLY CAN TAKE
YOU ANYWHERE.

02:29.190 --> 02:32.235
WELL LOOK, HERE'S A
SCHOLARSHIP COMING UP

02:32.318 --> 02:36.030

THING ABOUT SPORTS.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.361
{\an1}I BET I KNOW MORE THAN YOU
MR MIGHTY MICK CAMPBELL.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.238

{\an4}HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KEEP
SEARCHING THE HOUSE WITH
CAMERAS EVERYWHERE?

07:13.599 --> 07:15.685
{\an1}IT'S LIKE WE'RE ON A REALLY
DULL REALITY SHOW.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.854
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M STILL
TRYING.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.856
{\an1}RUFUS IS NEVER GOING

07:21.899 --> 07:22.525
EXCEPT WE KNOW WHO

07:22.608 --> 07:23.901
WE DON'T KNOW WHO

{\an1}OKAY I HAVE HAD AN IDEA
ABOUT THESE CAMERAS.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.592

08:14.660 --> 08:20.833
GET AWAY FROM THOSE

<i>GET DOWN FROM THERE AT ONCE!</i>

08:26.964 --> 08:28.674
<i>LEWIS! CLARKE!</i>

08:28.758 --> 08:31.969
WHAT'S WRONG, VICTOR? WE'RE
ONLY DOING THE SAME AS YOU.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.847
WE'RE WATCHING YOU,
WATCHING US.

08:35.932 --> 08:36.432
YOU IMPUDENT.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.976
IT'S A PEACEFUL PROTEST.

08:39.059 --> 08:45.233
{\an4}FINE. FINE. YOU STAND UP THERE
ON YOUR LITTLE CHAIRS UNTIL
LIGHTS OUT.

08:45.316 --> 08:50.863
{\an1}YOU'LL SOON BECOME BORED OF
THIS NONSENSE.

08:54.033 --> 09:05.378
(ghoulish wails)

09:21.310 --> 09:27.316
CLARKE! LEWIS! I KNOW IT'S
YOU. YOU ARE BOTH GROUNDED!

09:27.400 --> 09:32.154
{\an4}AND THE NEXT PERSON TO STEP
OUT OF LINE WILL GET WORSE
THAN THAT.

09:32.238 --> 09:38.160
{\an1}I CAN AND I WILL BRING YOUR TIME
AT THIS SCHOOL TO AN END.

09:38.244 --> 09:43.249
GO TO YOUR ROOMS
IMMEDIATELY.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.965
(Well played guitar)

09:53.092 --> 09:55.136
SORRY. I PROBABLY SHOULD
HAVE KNOCKED.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.514
BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.

10:00.558 --> 10:05.479
{\an4}I WAS DOING SOME RESEARCH FOR
ANCIENT HISTORY PROJECT AND I
FOUND SOMETHING AMAZING.

10:05.563 --> 10:10.026
{\an4}THIS IS ABOUT HOWARD CARTER AND
WHEN HIS TEAM RE-DISCOVERED
TUTANKHAMEN'S TOMB IN 1922.

10:10.109 --> 10:15.156
{\an4}THERE WERE 23 PEOPLE IN HIS
EXPEDITION PARTY AND TWO OF
THEM USED TO LIVE RIGHT HERE.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.325
THE FROBISHER-SMYTHES?

10:17.408 --> 10:18.993
{\an1}YES! BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN THE
MOST AMAZING PART.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.787
LOOK AT THIS.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.498
THEY WERE LATER INVOLVED IN
A HIGH-PROFILE COURT CASE.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.709
THEY WERE ACCUSED OF STEALING
ITEMS FROM TUTANKHAMEN'S TOMB

10:26.792 --> 10:28.753
{\an1}AND SMUGGLING THEM BACK
TO BRITAIN.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.048
{\an1}THEY WERE BOTH FOUND
NOT GUILTY.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.799
{\an1}BUT ONLY BY A MAJORITY
VERDICT.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.135
{\an1}AFTER THE TRIAL, SOME OF THE
JURY WERE REPORTED SAYING

10:36.218 --> 10:39.138
{\an1}THAT THEY BELIEVED THE COUPLE
HAD HIDDEN THE ITEMS.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.222
AND?

10:40.306 --> 10:43.392
{\an1}AND I CHECKED - AND TO
THIS DAY,

10:43.476 --> 10:46.020
{\an1}THE ITEMS HAVE NEVER BEEN
RECOVERED.

10:46.103 --> 10:50.399
{\an1}SO, YOU'RE SAYING THE TREASURE
WE ARE LOOKING FOR

10:50.483 --> 10:54.236
COULD HAVE COME FROM
TUTANKHAMEN'S TOMB?

10:54.320 --> 10:59.784
{\an1}THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M
SAYING....

11:05.790 --> 11:09.418
WHO'S EATEN ALL THE
BRANFLAKES?

11:09.502 --> 11:11.253
(all shouting at each other)

11:11.337 --> 11:13.881
WHO TAKES A SHOE?

11:13.964 --> 11:18.052
- AHH!
- MICK!

11:18.135 --> 11:21.347
PATRICIA, WHAT'S BURNING?

11:21.430 --> 11:24.934
{\an1}I HOPE YOU ALL LIKE YOUR
BACON WELL DONE.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.437
STOP!

11:28.521 --> 11:31.273
{\an1}WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS.
WE'RE GOING TO STARVE.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.733
WE NEED TRUDY BACK.

11:32.817 --> 11:33.651
AND THOSE CAMERAS
TAKEN DOWN.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.779
{\an1}WE NEED TO SHOW THEM WE
MEAN BUSINESS.

11:36.862 --> 11:40.616
{\an1}AND I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW TO DO IT!

11:59.885 --> 12:05.766
{\an1}WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? GET
TO YOUR LESSONS IMMEDIATELY!

12:05.850 --> 12:07.810
{\an1}NOT UNTIL YOU'VE TAKEN DOWN
THE SECURITY CAMERAS.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.019
AND BROUGHT TRUDY BACK!

12:09.103 --> 12:11.522
AND GOTTEN SOFTER TOILET
PAPER!

12:11.814 --> 12:14.525
{\an1}WHAT? AS LONG AS WE'RE
MAKING DEMANDS.

12:14.608 --> 12:19.780
YOU DARE DELIVER
ULTIMATUMS TO ME?

12:19.864 --> 12:21.240
{\an1}I'LL SOON BRING YOU ALL
TO YOUR SENSES

12:21.323 --> 12:26.203
{\an4}WHEN I SPEAK TO MR SWEET ABOUT
HAVING YOU ALL THROWN OUT OF
SCHOOL.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.498
YOU DON'T HAVE THE
POWER....DO YOU?

12:29.582 --> 12:32.084
OH MISS WILLIAMSON,

12:32.168 --> 12:36.464
I HAVE MORE POWER THAN YOU
COULD EVER IMAGINE.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.756
NOW GET TO SCHOOL ALL OF YOU.

12:37.840 --> 12:43.471
UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO
SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.

12:52.146 --> 12:56.692
{\an1}THING IS, IT'S THIS SPORTS
SCHOLARSHIP.

12:56.775 --> 13:01.530
{\an1}I NEED A GOOD REFERENCE
FROM THE SCHOOL.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.283
{\an1}THERE'S A CLASS ON SEA COWS
I REALLY WANT TO HEAR.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.911
SORRY PATRICIA.

13:06.994 --> 13:09.538
{\an4}MY PARENTAL UNITS WOULD KILL
ME IF I GET EXPELLED FROM YET
ANOTHER SCHOOL.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.833
{\an1}YEAH. BAD IDEA ANYWAY.
I'M OUT.

13:12.917 --> 13:17.546
OH WELL, SO MUCH FOR
SOLIDARITY.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.631
AMBER?

13:18.714 --> 13:23.344
{\an1}I'M SORRY. I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.429
I'M JUST SCARED OF

13:25.513 --> 13:27.223
(Whispers) "THE CONSEQUENCE.

13:27.306 --> 13:34.480
{\an1}VERY WISE MISS MILLINGTON.
VERY WISE INDEED.

13:38.025 --> 13:44.240
AND SO WE HAVE THE
RINGLEADERS.

13:44.323 --> 13:48.160
{\an1}I'M GIVING YOU ONE LAST CHANCE
TO OBEY MY ORDERS.

13:48.244 --> 13:53.541
GO TO SCHOOL.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.834
NO.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.590
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

14:01.674 --> 14:04.843
I THINK I SAID "NO."

14:04.927 --> 14:09.932
YEAH. SHE SAID NO.

14:10.015 --> 14:13.435
NO.

14:13.519 --> 14:17.064
(Together) NO!!!

14:29.076 --> 14:32.162
{\an1}MICK! MICK, SOMEONE TO SEE
YOU IN MY OFFICE.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.455
HEY CAREFUL MICK,

14:33.539 --> 14:36.292
{\an1}LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED WITH
JOY, SHE NEVER CAME OUT AGAIN!

14:36.375 --> 14:38.210
MOST AMUSING. IT'S YOUR FATHER.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.796
COME ON.

14:40.879 --> 14:43.299
DAD. THIS IS A SURPRISE.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.925
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.012
{\an4}SO, WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT
YOU CHANGING YOUR STUDY
CHOICES.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.807
I KNOW YOU HAD YOUR HEART
SET ON ME BEING A DOCTOR.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.851
NO, YOU'D SET YOUR HEART ON IT.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.312
{\an1}WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS
SINCE YOU WERE SMALL.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.479
(Knock knock knock)

14:57.563 --> 14:59.607
MRS ANDREWS WONDERED IF.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.151
{\an1}OH, SORRY. I WAS LOOKING
FOR MR SWEET.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.402
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE'S
GONE, SORRY.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.446
DAD THIS IS MARA.

15:05.529 --> 15:10.743
{\an4}SHE'S HELPING ME PUT TOGETHER
MY SUBMISSION FOR THE UCLA
SUMMER SCHOOL.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.162
{\an1}MARA, THAT'S VERY GOOD OF
YOU I'M SURE,

15:13.245 --> 15:14.997
{\an1}BUT MICK WON'T BE NEEDING
YOUR HELP ANY MORE.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.040
DAD!

15:16.123 --> 15:20.794
{\an1}WHAT?! LOOK, WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT MR CAMPBELL.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.131
I DON'T WANT MICK TO HAVE TO GO
THROUGH WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.717
MY PARENTS WERE PUSHY AS WELL.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.676
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.345
THEY'RE ATHLETES SEE.

15:29.428 --> 15:34.725
{\an4}I TRIED TO LIVE UP TO THEIR
EXPECTATIONS, BUT BASICALLY
I STRUGGLED WITH SPORTS.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.811
{\an1}AND MICK STRUGGLES WITH
SCIENCE,

15:37.895 --> 15:41.065
{\an1}AND THAT'S A PROBLEM IF YOU'RE
GOING TO BE A DOCTOR.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.776
{\an4}YOU SEEM TO BE TAKING A
GREAT INTEREST IN MY SON'S
CAREER MARA?

15:43.859 --> 15:45.694
{\an1}THAT'S BECAUSE I CARE
ABOUT HIM.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.071
AND SO DO I.

15:47.154 --> 15:52.993
{\an4}THEN WHY CAN'T YOU LET HIM
DO WHAT HE WANTS? WHAT HE'S
GOOD AT?

15:55.621 --> 15:59.208
QUITE A GIRL, EH MICK?

15:59.291 --> 16:03.045
I SUPPOSE YOU'D BETTER LET ME
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT BROCHURE.

16:27.736 --> 16:31.699
{\an1}1922? THE YEAR TUTANKHAMEN'S
TOMB WAS DISCOVERED?

16:31.782 --> 16:33.367
THAT IS WHAT THE NUMBERS
MEANT.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.577
CHECK YOU OUT!

16:35.661 --> 16:40.541
{\an4}CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THERE REALLY
ARE RELICS FROM TUTANKAHMEN'S
TOMB HIDDEN IN ANUBIS HOUSE.

16:40.624 --> 16:47.923
{\an4}THIS COULD BE HUGE. AND OUR
NEXT CLUE MUST BE LINKED TO
THIS DATE SOMEHOW.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.592
{\an1}MR CAMPBELL. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

16:50.676 --> 16:53.011
HELLO AMBER, JUST BEEN
VISITING MICK.

16:53.095 --> 16:53.637
HOW ARE YOU?

16:53.721 --> 16:54.930
WELL, I HAVE BEEN BETTER.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.932
{\an4}COME AND HAVE A
CARAMELLOLATTECCINO WITH
ME IN THE COMMON ROOM

16:57.015 --> 16:57.599
{\an1}AND I'LL TELL
YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

16:57.683 --> 17:02.354
IT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.775
{\an1}OH SOME SILLY PROTEST OVER
NOTHING MRS ANDREWS,

17:06.858 --> 17:16.326
{\an4}IT WILL ALL BE OVER BY
LUNCHTIME YOU MARK MY...
I HAVE TO GO. SORRY.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.589
(Whispers) WELL?

17:28.672 --> 17:29.965
(Whispers) IT'S 1922.

17:30.048 --> 17:31.800
YES!

17:31.884 --> 17:38.724
{\an5}OKAY, WHEN I SAY "GO" YOU'VE
GOT AROUND ABOUT 30 SECONDS MAX
TO GET A CLOSER LOOK, OKAY?

17:38.807 --> 17:42.478
YOU DO HAVE A PLAN, RIGHT?

17:42.561 --> 17:45.856
EHH...YEAH!

17:45.939 --> 17:47.316
WHAT IS GOING ON?

17:47.399 --> 17:50.152
GO!

17:54.907 --> 17:57.534
{\an5}NOW, I'M NOT THAT TECHNICAL
VICTOR, BUT I THINK ONE OF
YOUR CAMERAS HAS GONE DOWN.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.037
I KNOW. OUT OF MY WAY.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.164
{\an5}SHOULDN'T YOU CALL THE
SECURITY COMPANY, AND GET
THEM TO TAKE A LOOK?

18:02.247 --> 18:03.165
YOU COULD GET YOUR MONEY
BACK.

18:03.248 --> 18:07.336
I SAID, OUT OF MY WAY!

18:07.419 --> 18:09.671
OH SORRY VICTOR.

18:09.755 --> 18:15.803
I SAID OUT OF MY WAY!

18:19.139 --> 18:29.358
HA HA HA. OH YES. YES HOW
VERY AMUSING.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.068
{\an1}THAT'S IT. I'VE HEARD
ENOUGH.

18:31.151 --> 18:34.196
{\an4}I'M GOING TO INFORM MR SWEET
THAT I'LL BE REMOVING MICK
FROM THE SCHOOL.

18:34.279 --> 18:38.408
{\an1}LET'S SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY
ABOUT THAT!

18:39.493 --> 18:41.787
(Hard knocking at the door)

18:41.870 --> 18:43.789
COME.

18:43.872 --> 18:48.418
AH MR CAMPBELL. STILL HERE?

18:50.254 --> 18:53.173
UM, IS THERE A PROBLEM?

18:53.257 --> 18:55.884
{\an1}YES, I RATHER THINK THERE IS
MR SWEET.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.219
OH DEAR.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.679
{\an1}I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE SAID
TO HIM,

18:58.762 --> 19:01.557
{\an4}BUT HE DEFINITELY SAID HE
WAS GOING TO REMOVE YOU
FROM THE SCHOOL.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.351
{\an1}I'LL KILL HER. HE WAS ABOUT
TO CAVE.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.105
DAD WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:08.188 --> 19:10.774
{\an4}I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE ANY MORE PROBLEMS WITH
SECURITY CAMERAS.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.276
{\an1}THANKS TO THAT YOUNG LADY
OVER THERE.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.153
{\an1}NICE WORK MR. CAMPBELL! WHAT
ABOUT TRUDY?

19:15.237 --> 19:15.654
TO BE RE-INSTATED.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.865
YES! THANK-YOU!

19:17.948 --> 19:18.949
MY PLEASURE.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.118
SO YOU'RE NOT REMOVING ME
FROM THE SCHOOL THEN?

19:21.201 --> 19:24.121
{\an1}SSH! THEY STILL THINK I
MIGHT BE.

19:28.500 --> 19:33.005
{\an1}HE'S GONE OUT. QUICK. LET'S
CHECK OUT THAT NEW CLUE.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.423
"BELEATHERED AND CLASPED.

19:34.506 --> 19:39.720
{\an4}HERE IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE
YESTERDAY ALWAYS FOLLOWS
TOMORROW".

19:39.803 --> 19:41.930
BELEATHERED AND CLASPED?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.432
AN OLD BRIEFCASE?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.851
{\an1}WHAT ABOUT AN OLD DIARY
OR A BOOK?

19:45.934 --> 19:47.102
LIKE IT!

19:47.185 --> 19:49.438
{\an4}REMEMBER WHEN WE GOT THAT
CHANDELIER FROM UNDER THE
STAIRS?

19:49.521 --> 19:51.106
{\an4}THERE WAS A BIG BOX OF
LEATHER BOUND BOOKS IN
THERE.

19:51.189 --> 19:53.609
{\an1}RIGHT! OKAY, LET'S TAKE A
LOOK WHILE HE'S OUT.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.153
OKAY.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.864
{\an1}I'M NOT SURE SECURITY CAMERAS
ARE THE BEST IDEA VICTOR.

19:58.947 --> 20:04.369
{\an4}IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT
WE KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THIS
PARTICULAR GROUP OF STUDENTS.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.039
{\an1}BUT IT HAS BROUGHT UNWANTED
ATTENTION TO THE SCHOOL.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.373
{\an1}YOU KNOW WE CAN'T AFFORD
SUCH COMPLAINTS.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.752
{\an1}RORY CAMPBELL IS THREATENING
TO REMOVE MICK FROM THE SCHOOL

20:11.835 --> 20:13.378
{\an1}UNLESS THEY'RE TAKEN
DOWN IMMEDIATELY.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.504
SO WHAT?

20:14.588 --> 20:18.300
{\an1}THEIR FEES DO FUND YOUR
RESEARCH VICTOR AFTER ALL.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.509
ERIC?

20:19.593 --> 20:22.638
{\an1}ACTUALLY I DO CONCUR WITH MRS
ANDREWS ON THIS ONE VICTOR.

20:22.721 --> 20:29.061
I'M SORRY, THE CAMERAS MUST GO.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.400
I CAN'T FIND ONE WITH A CLASP.

20:35.484 --> 20:39.321
{\an1}WE NEED SOMETHING THAT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CLUE.

20:39.404 --> 20:44.701
{\an1}"THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YESTERDAY
ALWAYS FOLLOWS TOMORROW".

20:48.080 --> 20:50.582
FABIAN.

20:50.666 --> 20:54.628
LOOK. IT'S FROM 1925.

20:58.465 --> 21:03.220
{\an1}VICTOR! BUT HE LOOKS EXACTLY
THE SAME AS HE DOES NOW.

21:03.303 --> 21:08.183
HURRY UP. HE COULD BE BACK
ANY MINUTE.

21:08.266 --> 21:12.270
{\an1}WHAT'S WRONG? YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

21:12.354 --> 21:15.732
I THINK WE HAVE.
