01:39.641 --> 01:40.600
You're late.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.144
Yeah. My roommate
forgot to set the alarm.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.922
The boss wants a word.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.893
I was cursed with boils.
Adriel saved me.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.019
Piss off, man.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.980
-You can't run from his judgment.
-I'm not running.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.359
Everyone will follow his lightâ€¦ or perish.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.631
Holy Father,
have I caught you at a bad time?

23:44.714 --> 23:47.092
It's always
a bad time in this job.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.678
I can't, for the life of me,
recall why I wanted it so badly.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.388
What's troubling you?

23:51.471 --> 23:53.098
Adriel is rallying his forces.

23:53.181 --> 23:56.059
I fear something terrible is coming.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.019
I'm all too aware.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.605
Then I must know
what we're doing about this situation.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.359
Where does the Church stand?
We need direction.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.069
We plan to release a statement

24:06.153 --> 24:08.488
denying that Adriel
is what he claims to be.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.866
That is our official position.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.951
A statement?

24:13.034 --> 24:14.077
Your Eminence,

24:14.161 --> 24:17.456
the Vatican has delayed
its response to Adriel for too long.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.208
It has allowed him
to galvanize Catholics into his fold.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.418
I realize that.

24:21.501 --> 24:26.965
But until Adriel takes direct action,
this remains a political situation.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.800
Should he advance to physical attacks,

24:28.884 --> 24:31.845
I will unleash the full power of the OCS.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.222
I only hope it is not too late.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.851
Trust in God, Mother Superion. Good night.

24:45.775 --> 24:49.070
Trust in God, Mother Superion. Good night.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.544
- Start lining them up.
-Oi.
