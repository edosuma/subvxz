WEBVTT

00:10.719 --> 00:12.137
Maybe we should help him.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.056
Wait, wait. He'll get it.
Thumbs are tricky.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.070
He doesn't know how to use a can opener?

00:29.612 --> 00:33.033
You're never gonna integrate back
into society if you can't do basic shit.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.206
It's simple, okay? You clamp it on,

00:41.624 --> 00:44.002
and you…

00:44.586 --> 00:45.670
Shit!

00:47.088 --> 00:48.423
It's broken.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.232
-Excuse me?
-Oh, God, no!

01:06.316 --> 01:08.693
Do you work here? I have a complaint.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.487
What seems to be the problem?

01:10.570 --> 01:13.490
I rented this costume
for my husband's birthday,

01:13.573 --> 01:16.284
and now I can't get the bloody mask off.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.953
Uh, sorry,
did you say your husband's birthday?

01:19.037 --> 01:19.996
Yes.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.122
Okay.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.292
So, your husband likes strong women?

01:24.375 --> 01:26.503
I think it's some sort of vacuum effect.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.254
Have you tried greasing it up?

01:28.338 --> 01:29.756
You could use butter. Or lube.

01:31.091 --> 01:35.178
Excuse me,
but why would I have lube in my house?

01:35.261 --> 01:36.387
Oh, come on.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.555
You've got lube.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.350
I want this mask off now.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.520
And it goes without saying,
I expect a full refund.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.231
Oh, I'm afraid we can only offer refunds

01:46.314 --> 01:50.318
if the costume's been used
for its intended purpose.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.070
What are you implying?

01:53.321 --> 01:56.241
You can't imply a customer is pegging
their husband as Margaret Thatcher.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.325
She is!

01:57.408 --> 01:59.869
Of course she is, but you can't say that.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.832
Sometimes I wonder
if you're cut out for customer service.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.041
You're absolutely right.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.960
No, I think the best thing to do is
to let me go

02:07.043 --> 02:08.419
with a generous redundancy package.

02:08.503 --> 02:12.090
You are a manager. Great liar.

02:12.173 --> 02:15.510
You hate people just the right amount.
I've never seen you miss a fag break.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.178
You could flourish here.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.763
Take my place when I die.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.599
That's a lovely thing to say, Ange.
But this is just temporary.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.226
Tim said that too when he started.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.353
He's been here seven years.
He still loves it.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.538
Absolutely not.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.125
Are you fucking mad? I'm not signing it.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.295
Listen, this is a very good deal for you.

02:50.378 --> 02:55.300
Your music in the lift
of every cruise ship in the fleet.

02:55.383 --> 02:58.052
They might even want your early stuff
for the hold lines on the phone.

02:58.136 --> 03:01.931
I sold out the
Bradford Ballroom five nights in a row.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.809
I've fucked 75% of the Rolling Stones.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.936
A cruise ship? I think not.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.606
It's time for a comeback.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.900
Valerie,
you know we love you at the label.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.445
But only one person with your condition
has made a comeback, and that's Jesus.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.947
I can still sing. I'm still relevant.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.658
Fuck it. I'll even do a duet.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.119
What's Whitney Houston up to these days?

03:41.346 --> 03:44.015
Get out. I'm literally about
to start auditioning people.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.808
-Can I watch?
-Why?

03:46.809 --> 03:48.603
I just wanna learn how to human again.

03:50.188 --> 03:53.983
Fine. But don't do anything weird.
Or say anything. Or touch anyone.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.151
It's very important to me.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.487
And not just to me, okay?

03:58.404 --> 04:00.615
I'm doing this for the city.
For the vulnerable.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.992
Jen says you're doing it
because you're a feckless loser

04:03.076 --> 04:04.953
who sponges off his girlfriends.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.997
And, uh,
this nostalgic imitation of virility

04:08.081 --> 04:11.918
gives you the illusion of control over
your emasculated, directionless existence.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.678
Although. I don't know
what most of that means,

04:21.761 --> 04:22.762
is that right?

04:35.858 --> 04:36.859
All right?

04:36.943 --> 04:38.987
She took the news very well.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.531
Yeah, that was very impressive in there.
Crystal clear.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.700
How do you feel about some moonlighting?

04:43.783 --> 04:47.203
We have another life-challenged artist
on our books

04:47.287 --> 04:49.038
that I think you'd work well with.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.542
Is it an estates dispute?
Because I'm quite junior.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.878
I'm sure there's nothing you can't handle.
You're very impressive, Carrie.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.924
Yes. Yes.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.385
I can handle it. I'll do it.

05:02.468 --> 05:05.763
Great. Saturday at 2.00.
I'll send you the addy.

05:05.847 --> 05:06.848
Yeah, great.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.117
Uh, name?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.036
Sebastian. Seb-- Seb.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.622
Seb. And your power?

05:57.315 --> 05:59.025
I can summon sea creatures.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.443
Can you command them?

06:02.028 --> 06:03.905
Um, no.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.326
I have a rich father.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.800
-Your name?
-Uh, Ade.

06:23.883 --> 06:24.926
Megan.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.637
Uh, what-what can you do?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.431
Uh, I can, uh,
phase through solid objects.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.308
I can turn anything into a PDF.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.560
-So, what? Like a fridge?
-Anything.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.647
-A person?
-Anything.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.815
I'm basically a magnet.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.901
It's not active all the time,
but when it happens, you'll know.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.365
It happened.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.003
Nice.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.296
We'll be in touch.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.760
Oh. I'm stuck.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.013
Don't mind me, though.
I'll be-- I'll get there.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.227
Mmm. Still stuck.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.191
Uh…

07:22.275 --> 07:24.402
-Do you have more people coming?
-We do, yeah.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.908
Excuse me. What are you doing?

07:30.992 --> 07:32.994
I have a 3D printing arse.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.538
I can do whatever you want
as long as it's aerodynamic.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.500
Can you do a spoon?

07:40.751 --> 07:42.420
So sorry. Sorry to interrupt.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.011
-Sorry.
-Come on. You can do it.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.013
-Come on. Oh, my God, yes!
-You can do it.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.306
-Dig deep.
-Oh, my God.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.640
-Come on, dig deep.
-Wow.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.767
Keep going with it.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.227
-Squeeze!
-Yeah!

07:58.311 --> 07:59.812
Come on!

08:01.481 --> 08:03.608
-Come on!
-Wow.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.279
No.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.823
Can I join?

08:11.616 --> 08:12.909
How did you get into the flat?

08:18.039 --> 08:21.000
Super speed. Like you have to ask.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.878
All right, how fast are we ta--

08:27.757 --> 08:29.509
Been to the Tate Modern and back.

08:30.384 --> 08:33.304
Their Dada retrospective is…
underwhelming.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.182
Cheers.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.733
Peace.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.122
Thanks so much for coming in.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.749
Oh, no problem.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.003
Sometimes I feel a bit like a photocopier
they wheeled out.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.256
So it's nice to get asked
to do actual legal stuff.

09:08.339 --> 09:11.008
'Cause I can do that,
but they never really ask me to.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.595
-Oh, is this a recording studio?
-Smart as a button.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.765
We have an artist who died
before he could finish his last album.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.060
Tragic, really.
His fans are still super passionate.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.063
And we already paid him the advance.
Uh-oh!

09:24.146 --> 09:26.357
So, if he could sing through you,

09:26.440 --> 09:27.900
then we could finish the tracks

09:27.984 --> 09:31.612
and bada-bing-bada platinum sales
in 30, 40 territories worldwide.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.697
Is that cool?

09:33.990 --> 09:35.032
Uh.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.247
-Three, two, one.

09:41.330 --> 09:44.125
-They want you to channel who now?
-<i>Colt Callaghan.</i>

09:44.208 --> 09:47.420
He was some big country music singer
in the '80s, apparently.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.297
I thought you were there
for some legal bullshit?

09:49.380 --> 09:51.382
<i>Me too,</i>
<i>but they just want me for my power.</i>

09:51.465 --> 09:53.634
Why doesn't anybody care
what Carrie has to offer?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.386
Probably because
Carrie talks about herself

09:55.469 --> 09:56.762
in the third person a bit too much.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.391
Can you come down? For moral support?

10:00.474 --> 10:02.268
I'm at work. I can't just bail.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.020
I'm saving up for the clinic.
I need the money.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.771
You can have a cut. They're paying me.

10:05.855 --> 10:06.939
How much are they paying you?

10:07.023 --> 10:09.483
I don't know.
It's a bit rude to ask, isn't it?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.736
<i>Please come.</i>
<i>I really need a friend right now.</i>

10:11.819 --> 10:13.112
No, you don't need a friend.

10:13.195 --> 10:16.032
You need someone who can get you
a decent deal. A real hard-ass.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.368
You need--

10:19.452 --> 10:21.621
Jen Regan, Jen Regan Talent Management.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.123
This is handwritten.

10:24.206 --> 10:27.376
We're a-a boutique agency
with a personal touch.

10:27.460 --> 10:32.632
Now, this national treasure is not opening
her money hole until we talk shop.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.883
Here is her rider.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.805
"Sushi platter.
Room temperature ice water."

10:41.015 --> 10:42.183
We can deal with this later.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.518
What I need to do right now, yeah,
is talk to Colt.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.145
He's gonna be pretty confused.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.355
Uh, money first.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.357
-We can offer you 250.
-Oh, please.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.235
Ms Jackson doesn't put on a bra
on a Saturday for 250.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.446
-Five hundred. Final offer.
-300.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.783
I think my client would
be content with £300.

10:58.866 --> 10:59.700
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.410
£300,000.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.750
May I just have a moment alone
with my client?

11:15.341 --> 11:19.679
Did he say £300,000?

11:20.179 --> 11:22.431
I could buy a flat. I could go on holiday.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.100
I could buy the Tenderstem broccoli.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.395
Tenderstem, Jen.
It is so much more tender.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.438
You could pay for the clinic.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.491
That amount would be acceptable, yes.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.084
When are our friends coming?

11:52.169 --> 11:54.547
They're not our friends.
They're my vigilante group.

11:55.881 --> 11:56.966
What are you hiding?

11:57.049 --> 11:59.677
You said that you needed snacks, so…

12:02.388 --> 12:04.473
-So, where should I sit?

12:04.557 --> 12:09.395
Uh, actually, um, I-I need you to
do something very important for me.

12:09.478 --> 12:10.312
Okay.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.649
Okay, um, I need you to

12:15.151 --> 12:16.152
get these for me.

12:16.986 --> 12:20.406
Okay, okay. Yeah, I can do that.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.450
I can do that. I'll get you your…

12:22.533 --> 12:24.243
…"tampons."

12:24.326 --> 12:25.953
-Great.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.622
-Where-- Where would I get a tampon?
-Chemist.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.207
Chemist. Yeah.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.087
Um, Jen says it's too soon for me
to be out in the world.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.380
Well, Jen's not here. Okay?

12:36.464 --> 12:38.424
-Okay, I won't let you down.
-Yeah.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.736
The miniature horse is unavailable.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.446
Unacceptable.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.031
Either you get us a big horse

13:02.114 --> 13:05.451
that we can look at through
the wrong end of a telescope, or we walk.

13:05.534 --> 13:09.747
Yeah, totally.
I'll sort all that after she gets Colt.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.669
Heads up, by the way,
Colt could be a little difficult.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.588
What kind of difficult?

13:18.088 --> 13:20.341
Where am I? Did I black out?

13:22.426 --> 13:25.971
How old are you?
Ah, wait. I don't wanna know.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.517
You told me you were 18,
and that's the line we're gonna go with.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.353
Colt, mate, don't panic,
but you're dead.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.815
My fucking wife.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.526
She finally did it.
She always said she would.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.610
Gotta respect that.

13:39.693 --> 13:43.072
No one killed you, mate.
We brought you back to finish your album.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.367
Sugar tits, you look
a bit like Margaret Thatcher.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.202
I like that.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.371
Thank you. Your tits look pretty good too.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.874
Wha--

13:54.708 --> 13:55.626
Holy shit!

13:55.709 --> 13:58.629
Maybe being in a woman's body
will give you a bit more respect.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.757
Nice! I can work with these.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.843
Now, what are these, a C cup?

14:03.926 --> 14:06.720
You've been gone a while. Is there
anything you wanna get caught up on?

14:06.804 --> 14:08.806
There's only three things
I need to know.

14:08.889 --> 14:14.019
Is beer still cold? Are guns still cool?
And is Jesus still white?

14:14.937 --> 14:18.524
-Oh, yeah. Come on, now.
-'Kay, stop that. Don't be touching them.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.318
-Get off them. Get off.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.862
-All right!
-Dirty bastard.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.368
Congratulations, men.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.954
You've all been selected because you
demonstrated to me

14:32.037 --> 14:34.290
that you are hero material.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.083
You've passed the first test.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.504
Will there be more tests?
I'm dyslexic, and I need more time.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.923
It's more a series of trials than tests.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.301
It's, like, informal trials
of the spirit and body.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.385
It's more of a metaphor.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.554
Really, I probably shouldn't have used
the word "test."

14:50.764 --> 14:52.474
Uh, any-- Words aside-- Um.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.185
We're all here for one noble purpose:
fighting crime.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.979
What does that mean, specifically?

14:57.062 --> 15:00.399
Uh, like, going after crime.
Stopping it and stuff.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.485
-There's lots of different types of crime.
-I know. I don't think we need--

15:03.569 --> 15:07.406
I suggest targeting child sex offenders.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.368
Go after the real bad guys.
Anyone else got a suggestion?

15:11.452 --> 15:13.871
-Fly-tippers? No! Murderers!
-Yes.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.289
What about the elderly?

15:15.372 --> 15:16.665
-Yeah, fuck 'em.
-No. No.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.210
I mean, like, people who scam the elderly.
Like telemarketers.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.712
Or the drug dealers,

15:21.795 --> 15:25.007
uh, people who put their bag next to them
on the empty seat in the train,

15:25.090 --> 15:26.425
rapists?

15:28.928 --> 15:32.473
I swear I had another
marker here somewhere. Sorry.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.643
I can get you one. Give me two minutes.

15:40.856 --> 15:41.690
What colour?

16:02.294 --> 16:03.379
Tampons?

16:23.190 --> 16:26.527
Okay, so we're down to nonces
versus children.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.696
Uh, surely that's a tautology?

16:28.779 --> 16:31.573
Uh, wouldn't we be protecting the children
from the nonces?

16:31.657 --> 16:32.992
They cancel each other out.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.411
It should be children versus women.

16:36.286 --> 16:40.708
If we help women, like, protecting them
walking home at night or something,

16:40.791 --> 16:42.751
I think they'd be really grateful.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.087
Not that we'd ask them
for anything in return.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.674
But if they did want to thank us,
just a perk of the job.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.843
Yeah, we're talking
about them fucking us, right?

16:51.343 --> 16:53.178
-No.
-What? No!

16:53.262 --> 16:55.222
No one sleeps with anyone they save.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.057
I'm drawing this ethical line
in the sand now.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.809
What if someone wants to give us money?

16:58.892 --> 17:00.519
Well, that's just tipping. That's fine.

17:00.602 --> 17:03.564
I'd like to put myself forward
as task force leader for this one.

17:03.647 --> 17:08.235
I know women. I respect women.
I love women.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.822
-Well, I love women more than you do.
-I have four sisters.

17:11.905 --> 17:12.906
I have a mum.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.285
-I've got two mums.
-I've got a girlfriend. Do you?

17:17.202 --> 17:19.329
-I don't currently have--
-Ha! Three-two.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.082
But that also means

17:23.125 --> 17:25.544
that I don't view women
solely as sexual objects.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.337
Neither do I. I barely fuck my girlfriend.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.549
I read Jane Austen novels for fun.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.180
I know where the clitoris is.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.729
Prove it.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.359
Have some water, pet.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.660
It's just… a lot.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.496
You buying the tampons
for your girlfriend?

18:00.579 --> 18:01.830
No, he's a boyfriend.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.917
Oh. You kids and your genders. Love it.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.836
I've been away for a while.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.589
There's too much everything.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.217
I'm sorry. I'm useless.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.887
Oh, chicken, no.
We all learn at our own pace.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.972
I can help you get what you need.

18:19.056 --> 18:23.352
What's their period like?
Heavy? A lot of clotting?

18:23.435 --> 18:25.229
Do they like an applicator or non?

18:25.312 --> 18:26.522
What's a period?

18:27.564 --> 18:30.275
Oh, Lord. Okay.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.487
I can see we're gonna have to start
from the beginning.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.996
Come on, chica.
Is this strictly necessary?

18:43.080 --> 18:46.708
When you stop trying to unhook your bra,
then the shame mitts can come off.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.919
-Honey pie! Sorry. Sorry.
-Stop that!

18:52.131 --> 18:54.299
Darlin', can you turn these for me?

18:54.383 --> 18:57.052
I ain't looked at these songs in 30 years.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.221
Need a refresher on the old lyrics.

19:04.726 --> 19:07.312
Jen, have you read these lyrics?

19:07.896 --> 19:11.191
I'm not a prude, but they're not exactly
very respectful to women or Canadians.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.987
I'm sure they're not that ba--
Okay. Oh, no.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.530
I don't think I can do this.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.616
What? Of course you can.
No, you can do this.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.201
Do this, please.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.454
I don't think I feel comfortable
saying this stuff.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.082
But it's not really you saying it, though.
Is it?

19:27.166 --> 19:30.377
It's coming out of my mouth.
My mouth is making the shape of the words.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.920
I don't wanna have a sexist mouth.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.714
What if I ever meet Malala?
I'll be mortified.

19:33.797 --> 19:34.798
Look, Carrie, babe.

19:34.882 --> 19:39.344
Look, you know I would never ask you to
do something you're uncomfortable with.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.222
Unless someone's going to pay us
£300,000 to do it, okay?

19:42.306 --> 19:43.348
So, maybe just do it?

19:49.188 --> 19:52.649
Oh, if I could just make some adjustments
to the source material.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.067
He barely remembers what he wrote.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.903
He'll sing
whatever you put in front of him.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.655
Yes. Okay, compromise.
It's the beauty of negotiation.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.618
Oh, where are you going?

20:03.577 --> 20:05.746
I made them get me
a handsome Latin masseur, Carrie.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.289
I'm not passing that up.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.458
You've got this, okay?
Don't worry about it.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.905
Honestly, this is too easy.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.282
Well, do it then. Or do you not know?

20:42.366 --> 20:45.786
How can you lead a group saving women
when you don't know where the "clid" is?

20:46.536 --> 20:47.579
The what?

20:48.372 --> 20:49.289
The "clid."

20:49.373 --> 20:51.458
-Do you mean the clit?
-That's what I said.

20:51.541 --> 20:52.709
No, you said "clid" with a "D."

20:52.793 --> 20:54.670
-He's stalling. I think we should--
-I can do it.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.362
Kash! I did it. I got, uh, your--

21:20.445 --> 21:22.906
-What's going on?
-We're locating the clitoris.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.075
Oh, it's right there at the top
underneath the clitoral hood

21:25.158 --> 21:26.326
at the crest of the labia minora.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.371
…Ora. Exactly.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.790
Guys, come on. It's basic knowledge.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.876
-That doesn't mean you win.
-Kash, I have your tampons.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.755
See? I buy my girlfriend tampons.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.091
Maybe you would too, if you had one.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.386
Thank you.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.654
You know, I like my women
the way I like my guns.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.822
With a silencer.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.701
This here is a tribute
to the perfect woman.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.055
This doesn't sound right.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.140
-We may have made some minor changes.

22:30.223 --> 22:32.976
-Creative differences.
-You can't just do that.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.696
You can barely notice it.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.251
Whoa! Hey! Man, I know that's not right.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.462
What the hell, man? What the hell?

23:00.545 --> 23:02.964
"I licked her out"?

23:03.048 --> 23:04.341
I think there's a market for it.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.968
Maggie, you know
I got a soft spot for you,

23:07.052 --> 23:09.679
but I sure as hell
would never, ever lick you out, Maggie.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.307
Do you hear me? That shit is nasty.

23:12.808 --> 23:16.895
Who changed things? This is my song.
Who changed these lyrics?

23:32.035 --> 23:34.454
£300,000.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.046
Okay.

23:44.339 --> 23:45.841
You don't have to eat them all.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.385
I'll never get to live
the high life again, Carrie.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.762
I'm not even good
at pretending to be successful.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.432
You were. For, like, an hour.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.477
Maybe I should've just
sung the song as it was.

23:57.561 --> 24:01.148
I should say I'm proud of you
for standing up for what you believe in.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.862
-Oh, you're really not going to, are you?
-No.

24:11.992 --> 24:15.203
It was so much money, Carrie. Oh, my God.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.876
Maybe channelling other people
is all I'm good for.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.754
Hey, shut the fuck up, you gorgeous idiot.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.591
-Your lyrics were good. Your lyrics.

24:28.091 --> 24:29.342
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

24:31.678 --> 24:34.055
And it's just money at the end of the day.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.140
It's only £300,000--

24:35.223 --> 24:38.852
Please don't say the amount.
It causes me physical pain when I hear it.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.941
Come on!

25:07.005 --> 25:08.340
It was his idea.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.426
-I love it.
-It was my idea.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.560
-What did you do today?
-I know where the clitoris is.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.647
Okay, I am not unpacking that.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.399
How do you play this thing?

25:26.483 --> 25:29.611
-Okay, so everyone starts with five tamps.
-Mm-hmm.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.906
And you have to get
from the Sanitary Valley

25:32.989 --> 25:34.991
to the Wings of Heaven.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.911
Mm-hmm. Don't get stuck
in Absorbency Marshes though.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.871
-That loses you ten points.
-Okay.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.915
And you'll start over here…

26:19.828 --> 26:22.122
-I think I left my umbrella here.
-Magnet girl.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.206
I have a name.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.211
-Have you got any piercings?
-No.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.298
Well, you're hardly microchipped, are you?
