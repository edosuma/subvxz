09:25.098 --> 09:28.233
Now, you don't see
Ty Pennington lose
his cool, do you?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.035
You want to be like him?
Yeah.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.103
Then just breathe for me.
Feel what I'm doing.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.205
Yeah, dude. I just--
I'm sorry, bro.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.741
But I get very passionate
about Sears.
No, I--

09:36.743 --> 09:40.245
I mean,
Extreme Home Make--
I mean, wha--

09:40.247 --> 09:42.080
Helping people.
Helping people.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.016
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.
Don't stop.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.885
Give me a hug.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.671
Baseball. Huh?

10:06.673 --> 10:09.240
Frank, what the hell
are you doing here?

10:09.242 --> 10:11.910
Those dickwads threw me
off my own work site!

10:11.912 --> 10:15.113
So how's the old
vision board coming?
You getting everything you want?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.248
No. Actually, we just started
the whole makeover process.

10:17.250 --> 10:21.219
We realized the reason why the
Juarez family hasn't achieved
the American dream yet...

10:21.221 --> 10:23.254
is because they haven't
envisioned it strong enough.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.824
So we're having them do
their own vision boards.
Ah.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.360
Why don't you be a lamb
and pass out some materials.
What?

10:28.362 --> 10:31.763
Go on.
Be helpful! Do something
positive with your life.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.299
Piece of shit.
Magazines, magazines.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.834
Here! Magazines.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.036
Cut 'em out with this?
What are you looking at?

10:38.038 --> 10:40.071
Frank, she doesn't understand
what you're saying.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.742
You gotta say "corte."
That means "cut."
¡Corte! ¡Corte!

10:43.744 --> 10:45.777
[ Screaming ]

10:45.779 --> 10:46.978
Oh, no!

10:46.980 --> 10:49.848
I am gonna blast
your face off!
[ Spanish ]

10:49.850 --> 10:51.783
I am gonna blast
your face off.
Shh! Shh!

10:51.785 --> 10:54.319
No one's gonna
blast anything.
No one's gonna blast your face.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.054
No one's gonna do that.
What did you say to her?

10:56.056 --> 11:00.892
I said what you said to say
to her and she stabbed me in the
leg with the goddamn scissors!

11:00.894 --> 11:03.194
Deal with it.
Deal with this.
All right.

11:03.196 --> 11:07.298
Baje tu herramienta
de corte, por favor.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.301
Um-- Hombre está loco
con pistola.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.470
Loco. Very loco.
Right?

11:12.472 --> 11:15.907
Y hace peligro
para todos nosotros.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.410
Yeah.
Okay. Careful. Watch it.

11:18.412 --> 11:22.881
Um, um, um-- No hace
que hombre le lastima.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.216
¿Sí?
That makes sense, yeah?
Sí, sí, sí.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.286
Oh, God.
I'm really good at this.
They got it.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.957
Dennis! Yo.
Last-minute thing.

11:32.959 --> 11:36.061
Gotta have this.
Brilliant idea.
We need a project for 'em, dude.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.063
Huh?
So, we got ourselves
a little Mexican girl here.

11:38.065 --> 11:42.467
I'm thinking, well, what does
a little Mexican girl love more
than anything else in the world?

11:42.469 --> 11:44.936
Mmm. Tacos.
Tacos, buddy!

11:44.938 --> 11:47.806
So, why not make for her
a taco bed?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.240
You know what I mean?
Okay!

11:49.242 --> 11:52.010
She gets to, like,
be in a taco every day.
So, okay.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.512
I got yellow sheets.
That's cheese.
Green, guacamole.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.380
Red little pillow
for salsa.

11:55.382 --> 11:59.084
I got cute little brown p.j.'s
so she gets to feel like ground
meat while she's sleeping.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.319
She's the ground meat
in the middle.
She's the ground meat!

12:01.321 --> 12:03.822
I like that, man.
That's a good idea.
Uh-oh.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.357
Hey, what is this,
um, blowtorch for, man?

12:06.359 --> 12:10.328
Well, that's a propane torch.
That thing's badass.
It's like a flamethrower.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.996
Okay. But what function
is it gonna serve?

12:11.998 --> 12:14.933
It's for the renovation, man.
It's for the controlled burns.
Oh.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.102
I don't think they do
controlled burns, man.
Are you kidding me?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.904
Bro, they definitely do
controlled burns on the--
They do it off screen.

12:19.906 --> 12:23.007
Off screen!
How do you think they tear down
an entire wall so quickly?

12:23.009 --> 12:24.943
They burn it up.
The community's got
a lot to do with it.

12:24.945 --> 12:28.012
And then maybe it's for
burning the actual rubble.
It's for tearing stuff down.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.515
Are you sure we need it?
I'm not sure we--
They take stuff outside--

12:30.517 --> 12:33.952
I'm buying it,
so ring that up.
What are we looking at here?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.453
That'll be $3,212.11.

12:35.455 --> 12:40.792
We're just gonna go ahead
and put all this on the
Extreme Home Makeover account.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.928
Ring it up.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.232
Really?
Uh, we're performing
an extreme home makeover.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.267
So do you not have
a button for that?
Yeah, yeah.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.136
We're helping out
a family in need.
We're gonna do some good deeds.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.038
We got a vision board thing
going. This is a legitimate
operation here, okay?

12:54.040 --> 12:56.508
This is the real deal.
I got a whole taco bed--
You know what?

12:56.510 --> 13:00.278
Um, if you just
give us the stuff,
we'll be on our way.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.480
I'm sorry. We don't
just give stuff away.

13:02.482 --> 13:06.217
Okay.
I don't know why you're
breaking my balls here.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.186
Sears does this.
Okay, Sears gives
people stuff.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.955
Sears doesn't
get anything out of it! Sears
doesn't come in and start--

13:10.957 --> 13:14.292
Look, we don't have
any money, okay? What are
we supposed to do here?

13:14.294 --> 13:15.426
I don't know
what to tell you.

13:15.428 --> 13:19.397
If you don't have
a bad credit history, you can
open up a store credit card.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.400
Well, yeah.
Credit card, huh?

13:22.402 --> 13:23.601
Yeah.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.805
All right. Just go ahead
and sign right there,
and we're all set.

13:26.807 --> 13:30.275
Now, this is smart.
The first step to becoming an
American, get a credit card.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.076
We need this guy to build up
copious amounts of debt.

13:32.078 --> 13:35.213
That's the best way
for him to build up his credit.
We're doing him a favor here.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.448
We're doing him a huge favor!
And do you realize
how extreme this is?

13:37.450 --> 13:40.919
To go from no debt to good,
old-fashioned American debt?
That's the way to do it.

13:40.921 --> 13:45.023
Plus, I've been envisioning
someone else paying for
this thing the entire time.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.158
I'm also envisioning him
unloading all the shit
into the car.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.461
Well, that's a great vision.
Guys, no can do. We're on
a very tight schedule.

13:50.463 --> 13:54.699
But we got him here.
Does anyone know why Frank has
been pointing a camera at us?

13:54.701 --> 13:58.102
I'll tell you why.
Because I'm tired of
this Secret bullshit.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.205
All it got me was
a stab wound in the leg.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.074
So I'm gonna record
everything you do.
Why?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.475
Because I know you're
gonna fail.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.611
Then I can watch it
over and over again.
That's ridiculous.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.947
Whatever, Frank.
You know, I'm glad you're
getting all this on tape.

14:08.949 --> 14:12.116
Then we'll have proof
of how amazingly generous
we're being today.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.218
You're gonna prove
that The Secret is real.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.487
We are all done here,
so I'm gonna roll.
All right, grab him.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.156
Thank you very much.
Let's go and do this.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.959
Most gracias--
Good luck. All right.
Got the store card now.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.293
Let's go ahead
and ring that up.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.229
[ Charlie ]
Bro, I'm not sure I have
the right look here.

14:24.231 --> 14:28.499
No, you do, man. You just gotta
start thinking of the tool belt
as an extension of yourself.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.302
It needs to reflect you
as an individual.
Do you feel that?

14:31.304 --> 14:33.504
Is that all that it is?
That's all it is, bro.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.407
How come you got awesome fray
on your shorts?
I don't have that.

14:36.409 --> 14:40.345
Well, ha-ha!
That, sir, is because you
purchased blue jean shorts,

14:40.347 --> 14:43.114
whereas I purchased
blue jeans and cut 'em,
thus the fray.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.516
It's a more authentic look.
I think that's what
you're feeling.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.019
And then why did you
cut them so high?
Way higher than mine.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.455
I thought you might ask that.
It limits restriction
of leg movement.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.957
You're gonna get more work done
'cause you got more legroom.
Exactly.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.093
Are you sure about that?
Let me do a little
demonstration on you.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.128
Take the tool belt off
for a second.
Yeah, yeah.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.030
Let me just
demonstrate something.
Let's get a demo.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.366
Take a wide stance.
Take the widest stance
that you possibly can.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.401
Let me see
what that looks like.
Okay. Leg movement. This is--

15:03.403 --> 15:06.704
Go wide as you can.
If I'm going wide--
and I'm being honest with you--

15:06.706 --> 15:10.575
- I'm maxing out about here.
- That's not bad.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.244
But check this out.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.647
Go. Go, go.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.415
Whoa! Any more?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.317
That's it.
But that's pretty wide,
right?

15:19.319 --> 15:21.586
That is good. You know?
And you're not getting
any high ride.

15:21.588 --> 15:26.691
I'm getting a high ride,
but the shorts aren't preventing
me from doing what I need to do.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.960
And that's the shorts.
That's exactly right, man.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.996
See, your shorts, they're
holding you back, man.
That and your hips.

15:31.998 --> 15:34.198
But I gotta tell ya,
the shorts aren't helping.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.769
Oh, this-- this is
really all good shit.
This is like gold.

15:37.771 --> 15:40.138
What are you gonna do next?
You are catching
all this, right?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.040
I got everything.
This is what we're
gonna do next.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.075
Charlie, grab me
that propane torch.
I'm gonna burn the wall.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.611
Let's go at it
with the wrecking ball
for a little while.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.680
Really?
It'll be more extreme,
and kinda awesome.

15:48.682 --> 15:51.149
Let's do that then.
You do the wrecking
ball thing.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.185
I'm gonna do a little
introduction thing, then you
do the wrecking ball.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.453
Do you want to wear the belt?
Mm-mmm.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.289
I'm gonna be the only one
wearing the belt?
Just jeans and no shirt.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.659
Wait. Can I see the stance
one more time?
Yeah.

16:03.128 --> 16:08.599
- That-- I can go lower.
- Bro, that is badass.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.637
[ Dennis ] All right.
[ Charlie ]
Is yours wedged in too?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.005
Mine is completely
wedged in.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.607
We can't even get anything
past the surface of this thing.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.210
There's like a hard surface
past the thin surface.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.311
Concrete or brick
or something behind--

16:20.313 --> 16:24.082
I was envisioning this
being a lot easier than
it's turning out to be.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.651
Use the blowtorch.
Great. It's time.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.053
No. Hang on a second.
Let me grab the flame.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.656
He's absolutely right.
I think I know
what the problem is.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.458
Look, I'm the one
who watches Home Makeover.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.393
I think I know what
we're not doing right here.
What?

16:35.395 --> 16:38.029
We haven't brought
the neighborhood in yet.
Absolutely great idea.

16:38.031 --> 16:42.066
Bring the neighbors in.
Oh, my neighbors are great.

16:43.135 --> 16:47.038
[ Whistles ]
Yo. Hey, come here.

17:02.254 --> 17:03.721
So did the neighborhood
rob us?
Oh, oh!

17:03.723 --> 17:06.657
Did the neighborhood rob--
Yeah, Charlie. And they took
my goddamn tool belt!

17:06.659 --> 17:10.094
I could not have anticipated--
You want to talk into
the camera and cry a little?

17:10.096 --> 17:12.463
You invaded our face
with that camera, man!
You know what, man?

17:12.465 --> 17:16.634
You know what? Just-- [ Sighs ]
Get me the flamethrower.
I'm so sick of this wall.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.604
I want to burn it up now!
Okay, it's time.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.572
Okay, there's also
a fire extinguisher too.
Great.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.408
I think we should
use this, man.
I think we should too.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.711
So here's how
this is gonna go down.
I will light a fire on the wall.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.312
Charlie, have that
extinguisher ready...

17:28.314 --> 17:31.282
'cause I don't want
the fire to spread past
the parameters of this wall.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.217
I will create a parameter
with the fire extinguisher.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.319
The only safe way
to do this, okay?
It'll be perfectly safe.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.088
Then once the wall's
all weakened from
the burned-up fires,

17:37.090 --> 17:40.491
we're gonna kick it to pieces,
smash it, take the rubble
outside and burn that too.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.194
Burn that too.
And then I'll put it out
with this. Perfect.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.862
And then I'll get started
on my taco bed.
That sounds good.

17:44.864 --> 17:52.503
Hey, hey, before you do that,
why don't you open that window
there and get a nice back draft?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.138
Now he wants
to start helping us.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.307
That's the first sensible thing
you've said all day, Frank.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.410
It's extreme,
just like we are. Charlie,
go crank open a window.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.612
Let's get a back draft going.
Frank, you ready?

18:01.614 --> 18:06.717
I've never been ready
for anything more
in my entire life!

18:06.719 --> 18:10.655
Well, all right.
Let's do this.

18:11.190 --> 18:17.328
Well, Mac, I think we
have successfully pulled off
one extreme makeover.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.630
Yeah. I love their eyes.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.667
Now while we wait, I was
thinking we expose them...

18:22.669 --> 18:25.369
to some good,
old-fashioned American cinema.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.337
Oh.
Apocalypto.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.639
They can learn about
how their ancestors
used to be savages...

18:28.641 --> 18:32.276
until Mel Gibson
and the Catholics came in
and saved everybody.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.711
Oh!

18:33.713 --> 18:34.612
Oh, hey, Frank.
Hey, Frank.

18:34.614 --> 18:39.650
You're just in time. Point
that video camera at the new
and improved Juarez family.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.086
Whoa.
They look freaky as shit.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.388
[ Mac ]
Wait till you get a load
of their ancestors.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.557
Pop a squat, bro,
'cause we're gonna watch
a sweet-ass flick.

18:46.559 --> 18:51.262
Oh, no, no, no.
I got something better to do.
Bag 'em and bring 'em with us.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.363
Come on. Yes, let's go.

18:52.365 --> 18:56.367
In fact, bag yourselves, too,
because I want this
to be a surprise.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.269
Okay.
All right.

18:58.604 --> 19:01.772
Come on. Right this way.
Keep walking straight.
[ Dee ] Frank. Goddamn it.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.143
It's hard to breathe
in these bags.
Straight, straight, straight.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.410
Okay.
Hold it right here.

19:06.412 --> 19:09.614
All right now--
Excuse me. Please, come
over here-- the family.

19:09.616 --> 19:13.284
I want you on this side.
[ Mac ] My head is sweating
like shit, Frank!

19:13.286 --> 19:15.753
All right.
Take the bags off.

19:15.755 --> 19:19.223
Whoa!
You got-- You got a bus,
just like in the show!

19:19.225 --> 19:21.526
It's all about the reveal.
Ready?

19:21.528 --> 19:25.229
Okay, yeah.
One, two, three!

19:25.231 --> 19:28.499
[ Together ]
Move that bus!

19:35.974 --> 19:39.243
[ Frank Laughing ]

19:44.750 --> 19:46.584
[ Frank ]
Whoo!

19:48.320 --> 19:49.820
Unbelievable.

19:49.822 --> 19:55.393
I cannot believe the judge
made me give my mansion
to the Juarez family.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.827
I can't believe
their name isn't Juarez.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.729
Was anyone else
surprised by that?
It was a shocker.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.666
Yeah. You know, it's a
broken system we got here.
It's a broken system.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.868
But at least we managed to
avoid arson charges, right?
Boom.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.437
That's good. Yeah.
Frank, I guess you're right.
The Secret's bullshit.

20:06.439 --> 20:11.609
Yeah.
You try to help people, and you
just wind up getting screwed.
