00:00.135 --> 00:02.135
Previously on Good Trouble...

00:02.235 --> 00:03.836
Welcome to your new home.

00:03.871 --> 00:05.938
I can't believe you
moved us into a commune.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.173
Gael! I'm so gonna smash him.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.209
I'm a terrible person.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.777
I had sex with Gael.

00:11.812 --> 00:12.911
I forgive you.

00:12.947 --> 00:15.047
I just got a job at a tech startup.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.716
Okay, well we'll get you
started on some data entry.

00:17.752 --> 00:19.796
She's working as a clerk
for a federal judge.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.054
Police shot 19-year-old Jamal Thompson.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.756
Who's going to clerk this case?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.135
I'll decide after I read your memos.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.126
I'm clerking the Jamal Thompson case.

Right.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.135
- Those are cute. Are they new?
- Yeah.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.805
Ooh! I also got you something.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.775
For work.

01:16.811 --> 01:17.876
Do you like it?

01:17.912 --> 01:20.045
I love it. How much did you spend?

01:20.081 --> 01:21.113
A lot.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.082
So I expect you to kiss
my ass for about a week.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.983
I don't want you spending money on me.

01:25.019 --> 01:26.051
It's fine.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.087
You know, you could
show your appreciation

01:28.122 --> 01:29.922
by going to the party.

01:29.957 --> 01:30.957
I have to work.

01:33.961 --> 01:34.993
It's called having fun.

01:35.029 --> 01:36.795
You should try it sometime.

01:36.831 --> 01:37.996
I don't have time for fun.

01:38.032 --> 01:40.732
'Cause in addition to
the Jamal Thompson case,

01:40.768 --> 01:43.168
I have like, 50 other cases
I'm supposed to be clerking.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.105
And I have no idea when I'm
supposed to find the time

01:46.140 --> 01:47.840
to study for the bar.

01:52.847 --> 01:54.024
Where do you think the judge is leaning?

01:54.048 --> 01:56.126
On the Jamal case? Do you
think he's gonna dismiss it?

01:56.150 --> 01:58.183
I don't know. And I'm not
supposed to discuss it.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.985
To be honest, I could
even get in trouble

02:00.020 --> 02:01.887
for telling you I'm
the clerk on the case.

02:01.922 --> 02:02.955
Come on!

02:02.990 --> 02:04.790
You worked all day,

02:04.825 --> 02:06.069
Judge Wilson gave you the night off,

02:06.093 --> 02:08.926
just have a couple drinks with me.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.730
I have to be careful about
who I'm seen partying with.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.832
I just can't wind up
on someone's Instagram

02:13.868 --> 02:16.068
surround by people who
are taking body shots,

02:16.103 --> 02:17.903
and like, smoking weed.

02:22.877 --> 02:25.911
I have to avoid any
appearance of impropriety.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.848
Are you sure that's all you're avoiding?

02:29.884 --> 02:33.051
Are you sure you're not
hiding out in here from Gael?

02:33.087 --> 02:34.853
I'm not avoiding Gael.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.793
Don't you think he should have
told you that he's bisexual?

02:41.829 --> 02:44.029
If it were me, I'd be super insecure

02:44.064 --> 02:45.931
dating a guy who's into both sexes.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.111
Knowing that I couldn't give
him what another guy could,

02:48.135 --> 02:50.736
that would just drive me crazy.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.038
Well, it's not an issue
because we're not dating.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.073
Don't hold back on my account.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.149
I don't have time to date.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.177
Well then, just have sex with him.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.778
Come on!

02:59.813 --> 03:01.146
Get dolled up.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.148
Let's get wasted.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.784
Come out of your cave.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.920
And maybe tonight you'll get laid.

03:07.955 --> 03:11.089
I can't get wasted.
I have work tomorrow.

Hello again.

Hey.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.085
Great party.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.720
Yeah.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.125
See you out there.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.830
What did he say to you?

04:24.865 --> 04:26.131
Nothing.

Oh my god. This is my song.

_

05:09.043 --> 05:10.175
Everything okay?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.777
Yeah, fine.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.046
You sure?

05:14.081 --> 05:16.882
You seem kind of standoff-ish.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.850
I'm just trying to get
my work done, Rebecca.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.822
If I said or did something...

05:23.857 --> 05:26.091
It's clear you're the
one with the problem.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.159
I am?

05:27.194 --> 05:28.894
Yeah, you're angry that the judge

05:28.929 --> 05:30.729
gave me the Jamal Thompson case.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.731
Because I said you're the counter clerk?

05:32.766 --> 05:33.910
I was just pointing out the obvious.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.768
That I'm just being used by Judge Wilson

05:36.804 --> 05:38.704
to shoot down the liberal argument.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.083
It's not really a victory for me at all.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.740
No, no. I didn't mean it like that...

05:41.775 --> 05:42.819
The judge just said we can go.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.843
And take tomorrow too.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.713
A night off, amazing.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.715
Not for me.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.017
I have summations on
two precedents still.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.119
- Want help?
- No, thanks.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.157
Have a nice weekend.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.696
Rebecca doesn't play well with others.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.797
It's not you, you know?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.866
She and the last clerk were like...

06:07.901 --> 06:09.501
Yeah, I think it's a girl on girl thing.

06:10.838 --> 06:11.937
For her.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.705
She's not like us.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.141
Elite political family. She's
had everything handed to her.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.043
It's not like you didn't go to Harvard.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.879
Yeah, and I have a mountain
of debt to show for it.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.127
Why don't you let me take
one of those summaries?

06:24.151 --> 06:26.752
Everybody needs a night off.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.860
Thank ya, thank ya.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.937
Jude!

06:47.741 --> 06:49.941
- You scared the hell out of me.
- Sorry.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.744
- I thought you had plans tonight.
- I did.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.980
To come to this party.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.882
Mariana made me swear not to tell you.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.718
Yeah, she's determined
to get me out there.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.921
Mhm. It's probably why she
invited your favorite brother.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.689
Probably.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.692
How are you doing?

07:07.728 --> 07:08.994
How's the dorm this year?

07:09.029 --> 07:10.729
It's better.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.963
And you're studying?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.098
Yeah.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.667
Trust me, I don't want to
lose my scholarship, so...

07:15.702 --> 07:17.068
So you're okay?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.037
Yeah, I am.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.039
Okay, so seriously...

07:21.074 --> 07:23.842
We're not gonna like, hide
out in here all night, are we?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.884
Ooh! What are we drinking to?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.052
Davia just got written up

07:34.087 --> 07:36.721
as top body positive
Instagram influencer.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.094
And the trolls are on the attack.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.830
Like this bitch.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.064
"Why don't you stop drinkin'

07:46.099 --> 07:49.167
n hit da gym u cow?!"

07:50.838 --> 07:51.903
It's not even clever.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.805
To all the closeted chubby chasers.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.741
Why else would they be stalking
my Insta on a Saturday night?

07:56.777 --> 07:57.777
I agree.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.051
Stop watching the door.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.819
I just want to be ready with the cake.

08:07.855 --> 08:08.932
Ooh! Is it someone's birthday?

08:08.956 --> 08:10.033
Yeah. My best friend, Sumi.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.100
You met her the other morning.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.725
Oh. I thought that was your girlfriend.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.668
Shoot! I'm late for my
circus class. Clean up for me?

08:23.704 --> 08:24.803
Sure.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.082
Oh! Can I borrow a 20 from your wallet?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.073
Yeah, it's in my room.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.841
- Great.
- Is that my hoodie?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.109
You gave it to me.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.744
No, I didn't.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.011
You should. Love you!

08:36.717 --> 08:38.049
She was my girlfriend.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.085
It's a lesbian thing.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.686
Everyone's besties with their exes.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.855
Because lesbians are more
mature than straight people

08:43.890 --> 08:46.102
who just break up and never
speak to each other ever again.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.126
I don't talk to my ex.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.160
But than again, he cheated on me, so...

08:49.196 --> 08:50.896
Oh, didn't Sumi cheat on you?

08:53.100 --> 08:54.833
Excuse me.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.979
I have to check on the cake.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.736
It needs to be served
at room temperature.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.706
She totally won't admit it

09:01.742 --> 09:03.074
but she's still in love with Sumi

09:03.110 --> 09:05.877
who, in my opinion, is a selfish bitch.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.851
You got Callie out of her work cave!

09:12.886 --> 09:14.086
Wasn't that your plan?

09:14.121 --> 09:15.820
Kinda.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.100
I see you're wearing my clothes.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.924
Yeah, I had nothing to wear.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.892
Are you sure you're not dressing up

09:20.928 --> 09:22.861
for a certain someone?

09:22.896 --> 09:25.764
- What's this?
- Nothing. There's no one.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.732
Are you seeing anyone?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.002
No one special.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.037
Maybe someone not so special?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.838
I'm gonna grab a beer.

09:33.874 --> 09:36.074
- You want one?
- No, I have to work tomorrow.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.109
Margarita it is.

09:45.852 --> 09:48.154
- Hey, do you think that's him?
- Who?

09:48.188 --> 09:50.896
The guy we saw hooking up
with Gael the other night.

10:14.264 --> 10:15.430
He's super cute.

10:15.466 --> 10:16.565
You don't know if it's him.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.334
Yeah, not with his clothes on.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.471
What are you toasting
to "Davi-bo-hefty"?

10:22.506 --> 10:24.439
Diabetes?

10:24.475 --> 10:26.608
Drink! Mariana, come on!

10:26.643 --> 10:28.610
- This is a good one.
- Coming.

10:28.645 --> 10:30.412
We're drinking to chubby chasers.

10:30.447 --> 10:31.447
I'll explain later.

10:48.332 --> 10:49.332
Here you go.

10:52.269 --> 10:54.236
So...

10:54.271 --> 10:55.315
Are you making any new friends?

10:55.339 --> 10:57.606
Not really. Not yet.

11:02.279 --> 11:03.279
Hey, Callie.

11:03.313 --> 11:05.247
This is Brian.

11:05.282 --> 11:07.115
You are beautiful.

11:08.318 --> 11:10.485
Uh, this is my brother, Jude.

11:10.521 --> 11:12.420
Gael. Nice to meet you.

11:12.456 --> 11:15.156
- Brian.
- You guys live here?

11:15.192 --> 11:16.525
He does. I don't.

11:18.228 --> 11:19.472
I haven't seen you
around much this week.

11:19.496 --> 11:20.595
Have you been avoiding me?

11:28.205 --> 11:29.205
Oh God.

11:48.258 --> 11:50.392
No. Work's been crazy.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.295
That looks good.

11:53.330 --> 11:54.529
You want one?

11:54.565 --> 11:56.264
Not right now. I'm gonna make my own.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.499
You have a heavy pour.

11:57.534 --> 11:59.267
It was nice meeting you.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.535
You too.

12:04.174 --> 12:05.174
He's hot.

12:05.208 --> 12:06.408
Which one?

12:06.443 --> 12:08.510
Well both, but the gay one.

12:10.247 --> 12:11.279
Which one's the gay one?

12:12.349 --> 12:13.349
Brian.

12:14.351 --> 12:15.351
Duh.

12:17.521 --> 12:19.354
Hey, do you remember in Turks

12:19.389 --> 12:20.555
you said you hooked up

12:20.591 --> 12:23.191
with a lot of guys with girlfriends?

12:23.226 --> 12:25.226
Do you think those guys were...

12:25.262 --> 12:27.295
Like, bisexual or...

12:27.331 --> 12:29.297
Really just gay and in the closet?

12:29.333 --> 12:31.232
They were gay when they were with me.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.448
I don't know why you're so
uptight about my sex life.

12:35.472 --> 12:36.571
I'm not.

12:36.607 --> 12:38.384
Haven't you ever just
hooked up with a random guy?

12:38.408 --> 12:39.688
I try not to make a habit of it.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.281
We should hang out with Mariana.

12:46.316 --> 12:48.650
Oh, I left my phone in
my loft. Be right back.

12:48.719 --> 12:51.252
- ... Not a rapper. Prove me wrong.
- Excuse me.

12:51.288 --> 12:52.554
He raps sometimes.

12:52.589 --> 12:53.600
Can we at least all agree that

12:53.624 --> 12:55.490
the best Drake covers are sung by women?

12:55.525 --> 12:56.558
Yes! Yes!

13:01.164 --> 13:02.164
Hey.

13:03.634 --> 13:04.634
Hey.

13:07.471 --> 13:09.337
I heard about Judge Lawrence.

13:09.373 --> 13:12.474
Why didn't you tell me that
your judge got Jamal's case now?

13:12.509 --> 13:14.476
I'm not allowed to talk about it

13:14.511 --> 13:15.588
until it's in the public record.

13:15.612 --> 13:18.613
Well, Jamal's mother tweeted
about it today so it's out there.

13:18.649 --> 13:21.282
She also tweeted that Judge Wilson

13:21.318 --> 13:23.318
has never ruled against the police.

13:24.421 --> 13:26.454
There are some special circumstances.

13:28.358 --> 13:30.225
So he's gonna dismiss
the case, isn't he?

13:30.260 --> 13:32.360
- I don't know.
- What do you think?

13:32.396 --> 13:33.461
I can't talk about it.

13:33.497 --> 13:35.196
Well, are you even talking to him?

13:37.334 --> 13:39.445
Because you said that you took
this job with a conservative judge

13:39.469 --> 13:41.169
so that you could influence him.

13:42.205 --> 13:43.304
So what are you doing?

13:46.343 --> 13:47.542
Ooh! I got one.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.611
From VegLover2.

13:49.646 --> 13:51.212
They said,

13:51.248 --> 13:53.348
"If you didn't put
yourself out there like this

13:53.383 --> 13:55.662
you wouldn't be attracting all
of this negative attention."

13:55.686 --> 13:58.186
Well, that's not even
mean enough to drink to.

13:58.221 --> 14:00.299
You're gonna have to do better
than that, vegetable lover.

14:00.323 --> 14:01.323
Seriously.

14:01.358 --> 14:02.557
You know what? I'm over this.

14:09.399 --> 14:12.133
- Oh my god!
- What?

14:12.169 --> 14:13.301
Laser tag?

14:14.538 --> 14:16.571
Seriously? That's why
they're missing the party?

14:16.606 --> 14:18.440
And you invited those assholes?

14:20.177 --> 14:22.210
So team, come on. Talk
to me, where we at?

14:22.245 --> 14:25.346
Uh, we are working on a new gif feature

14:25.382 --> 14:27.148
- that allows users to create...
- Uh...

14:27.184 --> 14:28.550
Actually... Hey, Josh.

14:28.585 --> 14:30.585
Um. Mariana's not up to speed.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.220
We decided to move forward

14:32.255 --> 14:33.499
with a re-factor on client side code

14:33.523 --> 14:35.290
before we add any new features.

14:35.325 --> 14:36.725
Smart. Sounds good.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.104
Alright, give it to me
as soon as it's ready

14:38.105 --> 14:40.261
and I'll pass it up to Evan.

14:45.502 --> 14:47.168
Okay...

14:47.204 --> 14:48.470
When did we decide that?

14:48.505 --> 14:49.571
Last night.

14:49.606 --> 14:51.239
Uh, I think.

14:53.243 --> 14:54.642
Last night?

14:54.678 --> 14:56.177
At the King's game?

14:58.415 --> 14:59.614
Team night out?

15:01.184 --> 15:02.350
Yeah, I saw your Instagram.

15:02.385 --> 15:04.230
We didn't think you'd want
to go to a hockey game.

15:04.254 --> 15:05.565
I didn't even want to
go to a hockey game.

15:05.589 --> 15:07.155
I love hockey.

15:08.291 --> 15:13.194
- Oh. What's your favorite team?
- The Ducks.

15:13.230 --> 15:15.396
Ohh. The San Francisco Ducks.

15:15.432 --> 15:17.198
- Yep.
- The Ducks play for Anaheim.

15:19.436 --> 15:22.203
Okay. Alex, can I talk
to you for a second?

15:29.179 --> 15:30.345
Look.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.614
I am really trying to
be a part of this team

15:32.649 --> 15:35.384
- and have my voice heard but...
- I get that.

15:35.418 --> 15:37.318
And we want to hear from you.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.354
But, to be honest,

15:39.389 --> 15:43.191
sometimes you're a little abrasive.

15:43.226 --> 15:44.626
Look, you're new here.

15:44.661 --> 15:47.362
If you come off as too ambitious,

15:47.397 --> 15:50.265
you might, like, rub
people the wrong way.

15:50.300 --> 15:51.466
You know what I mean?

15:55.605 --> 15:58.239
I thought, like, if we
could all get drunk together,

15:58.275 --> 16:00.586
that maybe they would let me
join their stupid little club.

16:00.610 --> 16:03.578
You wanna get these
bro-holes here? I got you.

16:03.613 --> 16:05.547
Hey, guys.

16:05.582 --> 16:07.182
This is Rain.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.328
Hi Rain. Perfect timing. Do you
want to get in a picture with us?

16:09.352 --> 16:11.486
Oh, um. Sure.

16:11.521 --> 16:13.588
Okay. Hey, you! With the boobs!

16:13.623 --> 16:15.290
Come get in a picture with us.

16:15.325 --> 16:17.403
You know, you're setting
feminism back like, 30 years.

16:17.427 --> 16:20.128
Yeah, well feminism doesn't
bring all the boys to the yard.

16:20.163 --> 16:21.462
- You too.
- I'm good.

16:21.498 --> 16:24.165
Okay. Everybody.

16:24.201 --> 16:26.201
Pretend like you're
having the best time ever.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.513
And if you could look
like you're totally open

16:27.537 --> 16:29.549
to getting laid by some
nerds, that would be great.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.239
No. No, no, no. Turn around.

16:31.274 --> 16:33.274
This way. This way.

16:33.310 --> 16:34.442
Oh, yeah.

16:34.477 --> 16:36.144
Say "cheese".

16:36.179 --> 16:37.278
There you go. Work it.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.149
You're having a great time.

16:41.184 --> 16:42.417
So much fun.

16:48.458 --> 16:49.524
What is happening?

16:49.559 --> 16:51.392
It's the Coterie anthem!

16:57.200 --> 16:58.266
♪ Let's go! ♪

16:58.301 --> 17:01.536

So, does your sister have a boyfriend?

17:20.323 --> 17:22.357
Uh, no. She's all about work right now.

17:22.392 --> 17:24.392
Yeah. Looks like it.

17:24.426 --> 17:27.362
- ♪ We just wanna see you ♪
- Shake that!

17:40.377 --> 17:41.409
So much for a night off.

17:41.444 --> 17:43.278
So much for trying to have a date.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.445
You had a date?

17:44.481 --> 17:46.214
Dressed like that?

17:46.249 --> 17:48.349
Yes. I have a personal life, Ben.

17:48.385 --> 17:51.586
Also, who files an exparte
motion on a Saturday night?

17:51.621 --> 17:53.053
Someone who thinks the police are about

17:53.054 --> 17:55.156
to destroy evidence, apparently.

17:55.191 --> 17:58.159
This is Callie's case.
Where the hell is she?

17:58.194 --> 17:59.472
Maybe she hasn't gotten the message yet.

17:59.496 --> 18:00.528
Yeah, well...

18:00.563 --> 18:02.497
She's not gonna want to miss this one.

18:11.341 --> 18:14.509
Hey, Coterie! Does
this belong to anybody?

18:14.544 --> 18:17.145
I found it in a bathroom stall.

18:19.382 --> 18:20.448
Uh, mine.

18:40.570 --> 18:45.773
Callie is one drink away
from being white-girl wasted.

18:45.809 --> 18:47.675
She needs a break.

18:47.711 --> 18:50.578
If a hangover's the way
she's gonna get it, so be it.

18:50.613 --> 18:51.646
And maybe she'll hook up

18:51.681 --> 18:53.748
and stop obsessing about my sex life.

18:55.452 --> 18:57.418
What do you mean?

18:57.454 --> 19:01.389
She just wants to know about
the straight guys I hook up with.

19:01.424 --> 19:02.623
What about them?

19:02.659 --> 19:07.328
If they're actually bi,
or just in the closet?

19:08.465 --> 19:09.465
Aww.

19:09.499 --> 19:10.499
What?

19:12.469 --> 19:13.634
It's not about you.

19:18.675 --> 19:20.308
Can you get me a refill?

19:23.613 --> 19:25.346
Ooh!

19:25.382 --> 19:27.315
Damn. We see you got
a new groupie, Dennis.

19:27.350 --> 19:29.517
Oh yeah, do we have to
hide all of our stuff

19:29.552 --> 19:30.752
from this one too?

19:30.787 --> 19:32.631
You can't prove that other
girl stole your sweatshirt.

19:32.655 --> 19:34.622
Then how come I saw her
wearing it on Instagram?

19:34.657 --> 19:35.790
- Exactly.
- Dang!

19:35.825 --> 19:37.525
This cake is busted.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.328
It looks like something
straight out of "Nailed It".

19:40.363 --> 19:41.596
Hey, don't...

19:41.631 --> 19:43.331
What wrong with you? Don't touch that.

19:43.366 --> 19:44.599
- Sorry!
- Malika!

19:44.634 --> 19:46.401
Teach your friends some manners, okay?

19:46.436 --> 19:47.446
- Wow.
- Is your name Sumi?

19:47.470 --> 19:49.404
Is it your birthday? I don't think so.

19:49.439 --> 19:50.638
Are you kidding me?

19:50.673 --> 19:51.739
What's wrong with them?

19:51.775 --> 19:54.642
Malika. That's your
friend. She trippin'.

19:58.481 --> 19:59.614
Excuse me.

19:59.649 --> 20:01.382
Pardon.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.421
So...

20:06.456 --> 20:08.589
These straight guys you hook up with

20:08.625 --> 20:09.625
who have boyfriends.

20:09.659 --> 20:11.659
What do you think?

20:11.694 --> 20:13.828
Are they bi or really just straight?

20:13.863 --> 20:15.730
Where's Mariana? I'm gonna kill her.

20:16.833 --> 20:19.600
Look, I shouldn't have said what I said

20:19.636 --> 20:22.603
about the straight guys I
hook up with really being gay.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.772
They may have been bi.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.607
Or pan.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.543
Fluid, questioning.

20:28.578 --> 20:29.777
Or, drunk.

20:33.616 --> 20:34.682
So do you like this guy?

20:38.788 --> 20:40.488
Yes, I like him.

20:41.624 --> 20:42.624
But...

20:44.794 --> 20:46.494
But...

20:46.529 --> 20:48.563
I don't know how I feel about...

20:48.598 --> 20:51.532
having sex with a guy who
has sex with other guys.

20:51.568 --> 20:52.767
And I'm not bi-phobic.

20:52.802 --> 20:55.503
- I just...
- It's new.

20:55.538 --> 20:56.804
Yeah.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.774
Bisexuality is a hard thing

20:59.809 --> 21:01.642
for some people to
wrap their head around.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.811
I mean, why do we have
to put ourselves in boxes

21:03.847 --> 21:05.713
when it comes to who we want to be with?

21:06.816 --> 21:08.649
Shouldn't it just be about the person?

21:11.454 --> 21:13.788
Were you like, born a wise old man?

21:13.823 --> 21:15.590
Kinda.

21:15.625 --> 21:17.692
Someone had to be the mature one.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.565
Is this bitch not even
gonna answer our texts?

21:24.601 --> 21:26.801
She's probably asleep buried
under all those summaries.

21:26.836 --> 21:28.669
She's not.

21:28.705 --> 21:29.770
I helped her finish them.

21:31.441 --> 21:32.618
I thought she didn't want any help.

21:32.642 --> 21:34.475
From you, I guess.

21:34.511 --> 21:35.743
She's actually pretty smart.

21:35.778 --> 21:37.612
I wouldn't be surprised
if she could pull

21:37.647 --> 21:40.381
a few liberal decisions out of Wilson.

21:40.416 --> 21:41.582
I doubt it.

21:41.618 --> 21:43.496
Well, he obviously sees
something special in her.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.620
Like you said, you have seniority

21:45.655 --> 21:47.533
and yet he gave her the
only constitutional case

21:47.557 --> 21:48.997
he's likely to get while we're here.

21:50.493 --> 21:51.493
You know what?

21:51.528 --> 21:52.627
We can't wait for Callie.

21:52.662 --> 21:54.462
Let's just write this memo ourselves.

21:54.497 --> 21:55.741
We already pulled the precedents,

21:55.765 --> 21:58.699
- it's really a one person job.
- Fine. I'll do it.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.468
And get all the credit?

22:00.503 --> 22:01.802
No. Why don't we flip for it?

22:01.838 --> 22:03.471
- We're not flipping...
- Head or tails?

22:03.506 --> 22:04.539
Heads.

22:07.644 --> 22:08.776
It was heads.

22:08.811 --> 22:09.811
You win.

22:09.846 --> 22:11.479
Damnit.

22:11.514 --> 22:12.580
It was your idea.

22:12.615 --> 22:14.615
Fine. You write the memo.

22:14.651 --> 22:15.931
I could use a good nights sleep.

22:25.795 --> 22:29.564
I don't know. I don't think
I'm ever going to date again.

22:29.599 --> 22:30.698
He is fine.

22:30.733 --> 22:31.799
Who is that?

22:39.809 --> 22:41.742
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:42.879 --> 22:44.345
I didn't think you'd come.

22:45.882 --> 22:47.648
Is there somewhere else we can talk?

22:48.885 --> 22:49.885
Yeah.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.456
Okay, now they're at a strip club.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.504
It's like they're mocking me.

22:58.528 --> 23:01.329
Okay. Time to go
Insta-Live. Let's fire it up.

23:01.364 --> 23:02.697
No, I'm over them.

23:02.732 --> 23:04.398
Go big or go home.

23:04.434 --> 23:06.434
You want these boys to respect you?

23:06.469 --> 23:08.569
Let's show them how
the big girls get down.

23:08.605 --> 23:09.605
Let's go.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.539
Okay.

23:11.574 --> 23:12.773
'Sup, fam?

23:12.809 --> 23:15.710
Ha! Look what's going
down at the Coterie.

23:15.745 --> 23:19.447
We're getting lit and not taking shit.

23:19.482 --> 23:20.715
Uh-uh. Look at.

23:20.750 --> 23:22.783
How dumb are you to not come through?

23:22.819 --> 23:24.685
Alex, you giant asshole.

23:24.721 --> 23:26.454
- Dude!
- What?

23:26.489 --> 23:27.622
Alex is like my boss.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.423
So? You didn't say it. I did.

23:29.459 --> 23:31.704
Okay but he's gonna know that
you said it because I said it.

23:31.728 --> 23:33.427
Oh.

23:33.463 --> 23:35.496
Well, take it down.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.633
He already saw it.

23:40.637 --> 23:41.702
I am so fired.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.770
So all we have is some hipster beer.

23:58.805 --> 23:59.971
Hope that's okay.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.039
Yeah.

24:01.074 --> 24:02.740
It's fine, thanks.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.347
It's the only picture I have of us.

24:22.162 --> 24:23.227
It's been a minute.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.764
You look good.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.767
Still got that baby face.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.135
You still don't.

24:31.171 --> 24:33.783
Well, it's not my fault nobody ever
believed you were my big brother.

24:33.807 --> 24:34.884
You know, with your hair so high,

24:34.908 --> 24:36.819
it always make you look,
like, a foot taller than me.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.109
Okay, that's why you're short

24:38.144 --> 24:40.122
- 'cause my hair.
- You know what? Don't even go there. Okay.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.221
You wanna see the roof?

24:50.256 --> 24:51.856
It's beautiful up there.

24:53.827 --> 24:54.937
Where you been living?

24:54.961 --> 24:56.127
What you up to?

24:56.162 --> 24:58.096
Look, I ain't really come here to chat.

25:02.869 --> 25:03.968
Mom is sick.

25:07.140 --> 25:08.140
For real this time?

25:08.174 --> 25:09.974
Why you gotta be so hard on her?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.876
How many times has she played us?

25:13.046 --> 25:14.126
I shouldn't have come here.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.981
You cut her out of your
life a long time ago.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.082
No, I was protecting us.

25:18.118 --> 25:19.784
No, you should've let me protect us.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.130
- You were 11.
- And we were okay.

25:21.154 --> 25:22.154
No! We were hungry.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.236
We were hunting for change in the couch

25:27.260 --> 25:29.138
so that we could get
chips at the corner store.

25:29.162 --> 25:31.763
- You shouldn't have called CPS.
- Why didn't you call?

25:31.798 --> 25:34.132
I was 10 and I knew we weren't okay.

25:34.167 --> 25:36.734
Was the system any better for you?

25:38.972 --> 25:40.838
'Cause it sure as hell wasn't for me.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.330
I thought they would keep us together.

25:48.081 --> 25:50.148
Just do what you want, Malika.

25:50.183 --> 25:51.749
You always have.

25:53.153 --> 25:55.887
I still think you should
see Mom before it's too late.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.798
Maybe you could come through again?

26:11.905 --> 26:12.970
I don't know.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.063
Hey.

26:40.133 --> 26:42.900
I hope I didn't make
things weird with anyone.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.168
What do you mean?

26:44.204 --> 26:46.037
Callie.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.061
Are you hooking up with her?

26:50.076 --> 26:52.910
- Did Davia tell you that?
- No.

26:52.946 --> 26:55.046
It's just that two pretty
girls moved into the loft.

26:56.816 --> 26:57.882
It's none of my business.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.016
We're not hooking up.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.918
'Cause I wouldn't blame you if you were.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.754
She is gorgeous.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.972
I'm not your date tonight.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.874
You could be.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.877
I've got another party to go to.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.880
Maybe I'll text you later.

27:39.259 --> 27:43.160
- Hey! You Callie right?
- Yeah.

27:43.196 --> 27:45.963
Girl, Malika has told
us so much about you.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
You're clerking for the
new judge on Jamal's case.

27:48.034 --> 27:51.068
I just wanna say it
feels so good to know

27:51.104 --> 27:53.104
that we got an ally on the inside.

27:56.242 --> 27:59.977
Sorry about that Insta.

28:00.013 --> 28:02.914
My friend's wasted.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.749
Oh sure, throw me under the bus.

28:04.784 --> 28:05.995
You deserve to be under the bus.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.818
He's writing back.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.054
You guys! You guys! I
have something to tell you.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.756
Oh my god. Sumi's here.

28:12.859 --> 28:13.958
Out of my way.

28:16.963 --> 28:18.863
Uh... Damn.

28:18.898 --> 28:21.799
- Maybe I should call him.
- No, don't call him.

28:21.834 --> 28:22.912
The bigger deal you make of this,

28:22.936 --> 28:24.016
the bigger deal it will be.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.173
Hey, Alex. Um...

28:29.208 --> 28:31.142
I'm not sure if you saw my text.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.743
I just...

28:32.779 --> 28:34.745
I wanted to explain
about my friend Davia...

28:34.781 --> 28:37.148
Uh, who... You know,
actually, I hardly know at all.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.216
I think she might be on molly.

28:39.252 --> 28:40.952
Or shrooms.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.754
You know, I have no
idea why she said that.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.957
You guys, you know how it's my birthday?

28:45.992 --> 28:48.759
So, Meera took me to
my favorite restaurant

28:48.795 --> 28:49.994
and this happened.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.729
We're engaged!

29:14.787 --> 29:15.953
Can we come in?

29:19.092 --> 29:20.858
I'm not sharing the cake.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.860
Bitch.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.766
You know that joke?

29:28.801 --> 29:32.069
What does a lesbian
bring on the second date?

29:32.105 --> 29:34.772
A U-Haul.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.941
Well, what does she
bring on a first date?

29:36.976 --> 29:39.944
Her ex-girlfriend.

29:41.114 --> 29:43.814
I went with Sumi on her
first date with Meera.

29:43.850 --> 29:46.117
Except I didn't even know
it was a date until she...

29:46.152 --> 29:49.220
started making out with
her right in front of me.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.756
I had to order for them.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.824
I mean, I felt bad for the waiter.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.794
He was standing there.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.863
What about feeling bad for yourself?

30:01.934 --> 30:03.868
You know, she is my best friend.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.169
I just...

30:05.204 --> 30:08.105
Also happen to still
be in love with her.

30:10.243 --> 30:11.976
Just tell her.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.112
I can't! Okay?

30:15.148 --> 30:17.148
I don't want to make things weird.

30:17.183 --> 30:20.017
Honey, things are already weird.

30:20.053 --> 30:24.822
Maybe you should draw some boundaries.

30:24.857 --> 30:27.091
I will, okay?

30:27.126 --> 30:28.126
I promise.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.195
Alice!

30:30.229 --> 30:31.862
What are you doing in here?

30:31.898 --> 30:33.197
You missed the big announcement.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.800
We're engaged!

30:37.136 --> 30:38.936
Oh my god! Wow.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.105
No, that's... that's amazing.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.907
That's amazing. Wow.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.976
And... I want you to
be my maid of honor.

30:51.084 --> 30:53.084
Sure. Sure, sure, sure. Of course.

30:54.187 --> 30:55.252
Of course.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.799
You told your friends I'm
clerking the Jamal case?

31:08.835 --> 31:10.101
Was I not supposed to?

31:10.136 --> 31:11.980
No, no one's supposed to know
what cases I'm working on.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.871
Okay, I'm sorry.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.107
- But you're like our only hope right now.
- No, I'm not.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.982
I'm not gonna have an
influence on this judge.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.010
It's not why he hired me.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.856
- Then why are you there?
- Because I can't quit.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.880
It would completely ruin my career.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.281
So you think you can just stand by

31:24.317 --> 31:26.917
and watch your judge let two
more police get away with murder?

31:26.953 --> 31:28.085
Callie!

31:29.989 --> 31:31.021
You know about this?

31:31.057 --> 31:32.089
What?

31:32.125 --> 31:34.892
The police are refusing
to hand over the 911 calls

31:34.927 --> 31:36.171
on the night that Jamal was killed

31:36.195 --> 31:37.862
and now his family is afraid

31:37.897 --> 31:38.974
that they're gonna destroy them.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.165
- When did this happen?
- I guess tonight.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.033
Jamal's mamma tweeted it out.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.903
She filed some emergency
motion to stop it.

31:54.247 --> 31:55.946
Did anyone see a phone?

31:58.951 --> 31:59.984
Oh my god!

32:05.024 --> 32:06.824
Hey, Alex.

32:06.859 --> 32:08.959
Trying you again. Just...

32:08.995 --> 32:10.161
Call me when you get this.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.097
Have you seen my phone?

32:13.132 --> 32:14.165
Why?

32:14.200 --> 32:16.233
'Cause I need it. I need to check

32:16.269 --> 32:17.902
if someone from work called.

32:25.278 --> 32:27.077
What's it doing in your pocket?

32:27.113 --> 32:28.779
Someone found it in the bathroom.

32:28.815 --> 32:31.015
Oh my god! Judge Wilson
called like hours ago.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.316
Why didn't you bring it to me?

32:32.351 --> 32:35.019
- I forgot I had it.
- No you just didn't want me to work.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.253
Hey. What's going on?

32:36.289 --> 32:38.055
Mariana might have just cost me my job.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.824
No, you missed that
call all on your own.

32:39.859 --> 32:42.026
'Cause you forced me to
come to this stupid party.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.160
Shit!

32:43.196 --> 32:46.063
- What are you doing?
- Going to work.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.932
That is a bad idea.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.111
You are really drunk right now.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.935
- I could get fired.
- If you show up drunk,

32:50.970 --> 32:52.047
you definitely will get fired.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.004
He's right. You can't go in like that.

33:04.150 --> 33:07.417
_

33:14.160 --> 33:17.761
_

33:17.797 --> 33:19.763
_

33:52.632 --> 33:53.764
Hey.

33:55.501 --> 33:56.734
You okay?

33:59.472 --> 34:00.738
No.

34:00.773 --> 34:02.673
I screwed up.

34:05.678 --> 34:06.744
What happened?

34:06.779 --> 34:09.746
I missed an important
call from work tonight.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.619
I don't even know why I took this job.

34:15.655 --> 34:19.456
Or how I'm supposed to keep doing it.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.592
I'm not allowed to
talk to anyone about it.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.864
I mean I don't... think
the place is bugged.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.543
You can talk to me about anything.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.400
I saw you having sex with
a guy the other night.

34:45.751 --> 34:49.553
Hey, Alex... So...

34:49.588 --> 34:52.589
I'm sure you realize that my friend
said that because I was venting.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.469
I have a lot of good ideas.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.793
Like, I had this thought
that we could incorporate

34:56.829 --> 34:58.729
photo filters in the eGIFany app.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.365
Yeah, I'd love to talk about this more.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.633
Um...

35:02.668 --> 35:04.680
I invited you to my party so we could

35:04.704 --> 35:06.437
you know, have like a couple drinks...

35:06.472 --> 35:07.816
Users could... I had this thought...

35:07.840 --> 35:10.407
I'm actually, like, really
fun to hang out with.

35:10.443 --> 35:12.443
You know... I didn't
call you an asshole.

35:13.746 --> 35:15.846
Sorry about all the calls.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.848
If you don't want to call me back,

35:17.883 --> 35:20.384
you can just... We can talk Monday.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.754
Mkay. Bye.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.461
What do you think? Did
I sound too desperate?

35:32.765 --> 35:34.845
You might want to think
about closing your curtains.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.703
Is that why I haven't seen you all week?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.440
I just didn't know what to say.

35:45.878 --> 35:47.644
Does it freak you out?

35:47.680 --> 35:49.680
That I'm bi?

35:49.715 --> 35:50.715
No.

35:52.752 --> 35:54.752
I was just surprised.

35:54.787 --> 35:56.787
Yeah well, you wouldn't
be the first person

35:56.822 --> 35:57.822
it's been an issue with.

35:58.858 --> 36:00.624
I don't think it's an issue.

36:03.396 --> 36:04.728
I really like you.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.499
And I wasn't cheating.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.434
Brian and I aren't...

36:11.604 --> 36:13.537
It's new, casual.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.372
How many new and casual people

36:15.408 --> 36:16.640
do you usually see at a time?

36:17.810 --> 36:19.376
Not many.

36:21.647 --> 36:24.648
But we aren't seeing each other anymore.

36:24.683 --> 36:25.783
Right?

36:25.818 --> 36:28.519
'Cause of Mariana.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.421
Actually, I..

36:31.524 --> 36:33.457
Told Mariana about us.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.460
She's cool with it.

36:36.495 --> 36:37.628
Really?

36:39.532 --> 36:40.664
Yeah.

36:50.576 --> 36:51.608
Sorry.

36:51.644 --> 36:54.445
It's just my head is...
everything's spinning.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.647
I think I really drank too much.

36:57.783 --> 37:00.751
Yeah then, maybe we should
get down from here, right?

37:02.855 --> 37:03.855
Come on.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.846
Hey.

37:30.483 --> 37:31.582
Hey.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.719
I'm heading out.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.387
I love you.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.524
I love you too.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.392
Bye, Jud-icorn.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.594
Bye.

37:49.635 --> 37:50.801
I'm sorry.

37:52.471 --> 37:53.537
It's okay.

37:54.740 --> 37:57.574
If it's any consolation,

37:57.610 --> 37:59.543
I might be fired too.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.656
Sorry I went postal on your boss.

38:12.691 --> 38:17.594
- I was in a pissed off mood.
- It's okay.

38:17.630 --> 38:19.670
Those trolls gotta get to
you at some point, right?

38:21.867 --> 38:23.467
It wasn't them.

38:25.838 --> 38:27.571
VegLover?

38:27.606 --> 38:29.540
The polite troller?

38:30.876 --> 38:32.609
That's my mother.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.546
Even when I was a kid
and I'd get bullied,

38:35.581 --> 38:37.514
she'd always ask what
I did to deserve it.

38:37.550 --> 38:42.486
It doesn't bother me that
she thinks I'm fat, I just...

38:42.521 --> 38:45.422
Wish once in my life she
would stand up for me.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.498
I heard Sumi got engaged.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.536
I'm happy for her.

38:58.571 --> 39:00.804
She always wanted to get married.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.742
I mean, of course, you know,

39:05.778 --> 39:07.744
I wish she was getting married to me.

39:20.593 --> 39:21.725
Where's Storm?

39:22.828 --> 39:24.461
What do I look like? The weatherman?

39:27.433 --> 39:28.832
And it's Rain, okay, Alice?

39:28.867 --> 39:30.434
Close enough.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.769
Hopefully she's not
ransacking the place.

39:32.805 --> 39:35.706
Oh, no, no, no. She ran off
with some guy in his 20s, so...

39:35.741 --> 39:37.474
Oohh.

39:37.509 --> 39:38.609
Ouch.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.811
Classic Storm.

39:54.627 --> 39:55.726
I'll be in soon.

39:57.630 --> 39:58.630
Love you.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.631
Jinx.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.666
- Night.
- Night, guys.
