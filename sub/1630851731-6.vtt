WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:05.037
- That's quite the scoop
your boyfriend got, mary.

00:05.105 --> 00:07.772
You must be proud.
- I am. Proud, I mean,

00:07.842 --> 00:10.508
Because steven and I are...
We're not officially...

00:10.578 --> 00:12.644
- Haven't you been on a date
three saturdays in a row?

00:12.712 --> 00:15.647
- Well, yes, but...

00:15.649 --> 00:18.183
- Sounds like a boyfriend to me.
- Any news, gentlemen?

00:18.252 --> 00:20.819
- Based on the eyewitness's
recanted testimony,

00:20.821 --> 00:23.322
Mr. Logan has been released
and a new trial ordered.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.057
- Are you confident
about the retrial?

00:25.125 --> 00:27.793
- I believe justice will prevail
and my client will be
exonerated.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.928
- And, mr. Logan, how do you
feel about this development?

00:29.997 --> 00:33.598
- Like a man who's breathing
fresh air for the first time
in three years.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.567
- Do you have anything to say
to the toronto police force?

00:35.635 --> 00:37.869
- Yeah. They railroaded me
for that girl's murder.

00:37.938 --> 00:41.206
What they did was wrong
and I intend to set it right.
- All right, that's enough.

00:41.275 --> 00:44.209
(clamouring)

00:44.278 --> 00:46.278
- So, this woman, she worked

00:46.346 --> 00:48.547
As a salesgirl at the eaton's
perfume counter?

00:48.549 --> 00:52.016
- Christine mayfield. But logan
always insisted he was innocent

00:52.086 --> 00:54.486
And now the evidence used
to convict him is in question.

00:54.555 --> 00:58.157
Frankly, it's mortifying the
police did such a shoddy job.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.894
- Sorry, mary,
but no surprise there.
- The police screwed up again.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.896
- That's where you're wrong.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.964
Derek walston.

01:06.032 --> 01:08.967
Christine mayfield's uncle.
- We're so sorry for your loss.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.036
- Well, I don't need
your sympathies.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.838
I need you to prove
logan's guilt.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.508
- But the judge just said--
- I don't give a hoot
what the judge said.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.910
Logan killed christine

01:18.979 --> 01:21.313
And I'm not gonna let him
get away with it.

01:21.381 --> 01:23.682
The question is:
Will you help me?

01:25.653 --> 01:27.586
- Why don't you give me
your telephone number

01:27.588 --> 01:29.521
And then frankie and I
will discuss it.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.058
- We don't need to.
We'll take the case.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.398
(jazzy theme music)

01:40.467 --> 01:43.035
(woman scatting)

02:05.359 --> 02:08.827
Hey. So, mary is gonna see
if she can get a copy

02:08.896 --> 02:12.164
Of the original police file,
but steven's article really
lays out the case.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.232
- Should we really be
doing this, frankie?

02:14.301 --> 02:17.236
Pursuing an innocent man
doesn't feel right.
- Well, if he is innocent.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.838
- Walston hasn't given us
a single reason as to why
logan's guilty.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.106
- If it doesn't go anywhere,
I'll drop it.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.842
- Ok, talk me through the case.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.779
- All right...
On may 9th, 1921,

02:27.781 --> 02:30.182
Christine mayfield left work
with her co-worker,

02:30.250 --> 02:33.084
Connie reynolds. They walked
together for a short time,

02:33.153 --> 02:35.587
Then christine took a shortcut
through the park.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.189
The next morning, her body
was found in a pond,

02:38.259 --> 02:40.192
Strangled and drowned.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.527
- So, what made the police
suspect logan?

02:42.596 --> 02:46.265
- They found boot prints and a
bottle with his fingerprints
close to the body.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.300
- And then connie id'd him
in a police lineup?

02:48.368 --> 02:51.135
- That is a lot of evidence.
- But then she recanted

02:51.205 --> 02:52.537
Her testimony.
That's not nothing.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.805
We have to talk to her, frankie.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.341
- She's gonna be here
any minute. Do you mind?

02:56.410 --> 02:58.276
- Wait--
where are you going?

02:58.345 --> 03:01.513
- Well, flo pulled the autopsy
report. I want to take a look.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.818
(knocking)
- come in!

03:06.820 --> 03:09.354
Do you still believe it was
ernie logan you saw that night?

03:09.423 --> 03:11.956
- Like I told the judge,
I can't say.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.692
Not for sure, anyway.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.430
I like those paintings
of the mountains.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.333
Is it the rockies?

03:23.037 --> 03:25.904
- Those are actually photographs

03:25.906 --> 03:27.506
Of pyramids.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.979
- Oh, yep, those are
the pyramids all right.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.647
- Connie, how long have you been
wearing glasses?

03:35.716 --> 03:39.184
- I bought these a couple months
ago. Took me years to save up.

03:39.253 --> 03:43.121
Truth is, I'm half blind
without them.

03:44.424 --> 03:46.225
- Hm.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.463
- According to the autopsy,
christine had a high level

03:52.533 --> 03:55.333
Of alcohol in her stomach.
Likely gin.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.535
- Maybe she went somewhere
after she left connie?

03:57.604 --> 03:59.337
- Or maybe she drank
with her killer.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.140
- There was a bottle
found at the scene.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.576
Are these ligature marks?
- Yep.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.612
She was tied up at some point,
but when they found her in the
pond her hands were free.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.681
- Any idea what
she was tied up with?
- Whatever it was,

04:09.750 --> 04:13.151
It cut deep. But there is
nothing about it in the file.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.754
I'll see what I can figure out.
- We really could use something.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.022
- New evidence in
a three-year-old case?

04:18.092 --> 04:19.958
I am a morgue attendant,
not a magician.

04:20.026 --> 04:23.161
- You never know, you might pull
a rabbit out of your hat.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.696
Thanks.

04:31.171 --> 04:34.172
(phones ringing,
typewriters clicking)

04:39.380 --> 04:41.580
- What's the mayfield's file
doing on your desk?

04:41.648 --> 04:43.915
- That any business of yours,
mcintosh?

04:43.984 --> 04:45.784
- You were the investigating
officer.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.320
Best stay clear of the case now
that it's set to be retried.

04:48.388 --> 04:51.056
- I was just
checking on a detail.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.924
- You didn't hear me.

05:00.266 --> 05:02.467
I'm gonna keep my eye
on this from now on.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.469
- Mm. Good idea.
Can't be too careful.

05:04.537 --> 05:06.671
- Mm, you got that.
- We've got him, right,

05:06.740 --> 05:08.940
Don't we? Logan, I mean.
- Dead to rights.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.209
We matched his boot prints to
the scene and his fingerprints

05:11.278 --> 05:14.012
Were all over a bottle we found
near the poor girl's body.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.681
- Ooh, you don't say.
What kind of bottle?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.617
- It was identified by detective
lyle as being

05:18.685 --> 05:20.685
From some place called
bridley's.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.620
Logan moonlighted there
as a delivery man.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.791
- That's pretty damning
evidence.
- Amen to that.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.565
- Yeah, ernie logan's
worked for me.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.233
So, who are you?

05:35.302 --> 05:38.236
- I'm a private detective. I was
hired by mr. Logan's lawyer.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.839
- Oh, well, obviously
not much of one.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.707
Ernie spent a long time
in custody

05:42.709 --> 05:44.909
For something he didn't do.
- Are you sure about that?

05:44.978 --> 05:48.246
- Who's ever sure
about anything? But he was
working for me at the time.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.048
Nights.
- Even the night in question?

05:50.116 --> 05:52.850
- Probably.
- You spoke up for him in court.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.786
- Of course I did.
He's a friend.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.988
That's what friends do.
You wouldn't do the same?

05:57.056 --> 05:58.990
- Not if my friend
committed murder. No.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.993
- Well, you might feel different
depending on the someone
who was murdered.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.197
Hey, speak of the devil.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.799
- Hi, bert. Come
for my old job back.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.503
- You got it. Your lawyer's
investigator was just leaving.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.772
- Frankie drake.
It's nice to meet you.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.874
- You're working for my lawyer,
are you?
- Mm-hm.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.743
They're pulling out
all the stops to create
a top-notch defence.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.278
- Oh,

06:20.347 --> 06:23.315
You missed the part about lunch
being a half hour, miss ohanian?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.684
- Sorry, sir.
- Miss?

06:25.686 --> 06:28.019
Still lookin' for
the right man, eh, stella?

06:28.021 --> 06:30.088
You're getting a bit old
to be so picky.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.957
- Good to see you back, ernie.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.894
- Now, look here, sweetheart,
I don't know who you really are,

06:35.896 --> 06:39.431
But I fired my lawyer
the minute I hit the bottom
of the courthouse steps,

06:39.433 --> 06:41.366
So why don't you drop that charm
and beat it.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.635
- Suit yourself.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.177
- You met logan?
- Yeah. He made me right away.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.245
- Doesn't make him the murderer.
- How's connie?

06:54.314 --> 06:57.582
- Blind as a bat without her
glasses, which she didn't have
on when she id'd logan.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.084
- Oh.
- Gals...

07:00.153 --> 07:03.188
Ok. I have not seen a file yet,

07:03.256 --> 07:05.991
But I do have a scrap of info.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.192
The beer bottle found at the
scene was from a place

07:08.262 --> 07:11.529
Called bridley's. Logan used to
work there as a delivery driver.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.665
- Yeah, ok, but flo said that
the high level of alcohol

07:13.733 --> 07:16.067
In christine's system was likely
from gin, not beer.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.871
- And if logan delivered beer,
he could have easily gotten his
fingerprints on any bottle.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.139
- Yeah.
- But it still proves
he was in the park that night.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.877
- That's not enough. Walston
is going to expect airtight
evidence. So is the judge.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.812
- What about the boot prints?
Between that

07:27.814 --> 07:29.948
And the bottles in the park,
it's a pretty compelling case.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.550
- We should take a look.
Do you think you can get
into the evidence locker?

07:32.619 --> 07:33.618
- I can try.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.955
(engine choking)

07:37.023 --> 07:40.625
- Ugh!
- I'm sorry I haven't had a
chance to look at the file yet.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.694
Detective lyle
was working on it,

07:42.696 --> 07:45.096
But then detective mcintosh
took it away from him.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.432
He said lyle shouldn't go
near it, what with the retrial

07:47.434 --> 07:50.168
Coming up. Anyway,
it was a whole thing,

07:50.236 --> 07:53.638
But I'm hoping I should be able
to check it out today.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.573
- This is what I get
for putting off a tune-up.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.243
- Doesn't alessandro contento
know about engines?

07:58.311 --> 08:01.045
- Well, he drives racing cars.
It's a far cry from
the tin lizzie.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.114
And I am more than capable
of doing it myself.

08:03.182 --> 08:04.382
- I know you are,

08:04.450 --> 08:07.519
But maybe alessandro contento
has some expertise--

08:07.521 --> 08:10.322
- You know, you don't need
to say his full name
every single time.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.991
- I know.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.727
It's just such
a delicious name to say:

08:15.795 --> 08:18.730
Alessandro content--

08:18.798 --> 08:20.765
Hello.
- Hello.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.934
- Mr. West.
- Mr. West?

08:22.936 --> 08:25.270
I thought we'd be past
formalities by now.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.672
You did break into
my apartment, after all.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.708
- And I thought we were past
bringing that up,

08:30.777 --> 08:33.745
Considering I apologised
with a bottle of gin.

08:35.214 --> 08:38.083
- Well, friend, sounds like
your car's on the fritz.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.151
Thought maybe
you could use a ride.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.954
- Well, that's
awfully nice of you...

08:43.023 --> 08:44.489
Um, mary?

08:44.557 --> 08:46.758
Do you mind if sebastian gives
you a ride to the station?

08:46.826 --> 08:49.994
- Oh, that's
a very friendly offer.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.031
But, ah, no, thank you.
I can--I can walk.

08:53.099 --> 08:56.401
- Suit yourself.
See you around, frankie.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.172
- Oh, frankie, I never
thought I'd say this,

09:01.174 --> 09:04.042
But forget alessandro contento.
- What are you talking about?

09:04.110 --> 09:06.711
- Did you hear how
he said the word 'friend'?

09:06.780 --> 09:09.581
Talk about delicious.
- Mary!

09:09.583 --> 09:11.783
(laughing)

09:35.542 --> 09:37.876
- It's a bottle.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.352
- Hm.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.221
Ah!

09:50.290 --> 09:51.690
Oh!

10:06.306 --> 10:08.906
- Why didn't you put this back
in the evidence box
with the boots?

10:08.975 --> 10:10.709
- I panicked.
What if someone finds out

10:10.777 --> 10:13.578
I compromised evidence? I could
be kicked off the force, flo.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.313
- Well, there's no use
in crying over spilled soil.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.917
Maybe we can make use of this.

10:18.985 --> 10:22.187
Frankie said logan swore he was
never in the park that night.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.189
Maybe we can prove he was.
- How do we do that?

10:25.258 --> 10:27.659
- By matching the soil samples.
Grab it and let's go.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.195
Where did connie say
she saw logan?

10:30.197 --> 10:32.797
- By the sycamore tree
near the fountain.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.367
That's the only sycamore I see.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.411
- Darn.
- What?

10:46.413 --> 10:48.379
- No match.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.149
- This was a good idea, flo,
but a bit of a long shot.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.551
This soil sample from logan's
boot is three years old.

10:53.620 --> 10:57.088
- Interesting. This soil
has manure in it.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.291
I'm gonna chat with that fella.
You coming?

11:00.359 --> 11:03.094
Excuse me.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.696
- The dirt on logan's boot
had manure in it!

11:05.766 --> 11:07.699
- And we talked to the
groundskeeper at the park.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.234
It turns out he only
fertilises once a year

11:10.303 --> 11:12.437
On his mother's birthday,
may 12th.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.105
- Three days after
christine mayfield

11:14.173 --> 11:16.441
Was murdered.
- Logan was already
in prison then.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.576
- One guess as to how the wrong
soil got in his boot.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.779
- The cops put it there
to incriminate him.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.581
- Told you it was big news.
- I spoke to connie again.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.718
She was able to pick out logan
from the police lineup.
- Well, that's not unusual.

11:26.786 --> 11:30.054
- No, but she was sure it was
him because of the checkered
scarf that he was wearing.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.989
The man she saw in the park
had a similar one.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.660
- Let me guess. She told
the police about the scarf
in her initial statement.

11:35.728 --> 11:39.464
- Exactly. Looks like lyle
rigged the police lineup so
that connie would id him.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.499
- This stinks of evidence
tampering.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.935
- It looks like logan was right,
the police were trying
to railroad him.

11:44.003 --> 11:46.204
- You were right.
Logan's innocent.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.173
Christine's killer
is still out there.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.747
<i> - Obviously you've made</i>
<i> a mistake.</i>

11:55.749 --> 11:58.349
- We've investigated thoroughly.
Logan is not the killer.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.819
- We believe the evidence used
to convict him was planted.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.621
- I hired you to find
new evidence,

12:03.690 --> 12:05.824
Not to refute what the police
already have.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.092
- Justice works both ways,
for christine and for logan.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.161
- The man's a monster.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.163
Even his co-workers
at the laundry know it.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.765
- That may be,
but he's not the killer.
- I don't need to be lectured,

12:14.835 --> 12:17.301
Miss drake. Good day

12:17.370 --> 12:19.871
And goodbye.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.041
- Well, that's one
satisfied client.

12:23.043 --> 12:26.177
- I wish I knew why
he was so sure it's logan.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.379
Well, there's only one way
to prove him wrong.
- How?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.949
- By finding christine
mayfield's real killer.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.189
What have you done to my car?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.657
- Look, frankie,

12:39.725 --> 12:42.160
Look how it turns and turns.
Beautiful, no?

12:42.162 --> 12:44.596
- This was supposed to be
a simple tune-up. My car
is in pieces.

12:44.598 --> 12:48.266
- No-no-no. Improvements.
Look, this was hand-crafted

12:48.268 --> 12:50.268
By my mechanic in Italy.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.537
Your wheels are going
to move with such grace.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.806
- The wheels moving was never
the problem.
- Ok,

12:54.874 --> 12:57.642
Let's put aside the troubles
with your car.
- I would love that.

12:57.710 --> 13:01.145
- And instead discuss
its clumsy design.
- Sandro!

13:01.214 --> 13:04.482
- A car should have the sleek
lines of a woman's body,

13:04.551 --> 13:07.218
Not the shape
of a deformed animal.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.353
- Ford's genius isn't form,

13:09.422 --> 13:11.489
It's purpose.

13:11.557 --> 13:14.626
He makes cars that are within
the means of every man.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.627
And woman.
- Who are you?

13:16.696 --> 13:18.830
And what do you know
about ford's genius?

13:18.832 --> 13:22.567
- You two haven't formally met.
Alessandro, this is sebastian,

13:22.635 --> 13:25.637
He just moved his studio
into the building.

13:25.705 --> 13:28.239
This is alessandro.
- Ah, this is your odysseus.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.375
Right.
- Hm. He is not a fan
of the tin lizzie.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.378
- Within means or no,
functionality

13:34.447 --> 13:37.115
Without beauty is like, uh,

13:37.183 --> 13:39.450
Wine without grapes.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.719
And frankie deserves both.

13:41.788 --> 13:45.223
- Frankie does deserve the best.
Can't argue with you there.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.795
- I thank you
for the chivalry, gentlemen,

13:51.865 --> 13:54.265
But I have a meeting
across town in 20 minutes.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.467
- 20 minutes?
No, it's not possible.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.270
I need two, three hours more.
- Three hours? It--

13:59.338 --> 14:02.606
Is your offer for a ride
still good?

14:02.676 --> 14:06.244
- Of course.
- I'll grab trudy.
I'll be right back.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.982
- It's very heroic of you
to offer a ride.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.420
Just make sure

14:15.488 --> 14:18.623
That's the only thing that
you offer to my frankie, ah?

14:20.626 --> 14:23.228
- Enjoy your tinkering, signore.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.036
- I managed to take a peek
at the mayfield file.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.906
- Anything useful?
- There was one thing.

14:34.974 --> 14:38.843
Turns out detective lyle first
suspected christine's boyfriend.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.912
A man named dan harper.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.713
He worked at hook's garments.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.849
It seems he was
the jealous type.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.451
- The cops follow up?
- No.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.387
Soon as logan was arrested, they
stopped investigating harper.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.189
- Is there any mention of derek
walston in the file?

14:52.258 --> 14:54.758
- Walston? No,
not that I saw.

14:54.828 --> 14:57.528
Hey, gals, is that everything?
I really gotta scoot.

14:57.596 --> 14:59.130
- Thanks, mary.
- Ok.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.067
- So, what do you think?
Should we continue on
with the investigation?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.336
- I think we could afford
a day or two, talk to harper.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.071
Should we go?
- You go ahead.

15:07.140 --> 15:10.741
I'm going to follow a hunch,
assuming alessandro has put
my car back together.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.577
- Right. What's the hunch?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.879
- Walston was all over us
about logan.

15:14.947 --> 15:17.548
Why didn't he ever mention
anything to the police?

15:17.617 --> 15:19.216
(engine starting)

15:19.285 --> 15:22.820
That is what I like to hear.
(chuckling)

15:22.822 --> 15:25.089
- A car should
purr like a cat.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.692
Not make the sound
like a wild elephant.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.161
- Aw, it's running like a top,
thanks to you.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.230
Those wheels are gonna be
spinning like an italian
race car.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.966
- Yeah, I hope so.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.902
I'm only sorry it took so long.
You must allow me to make it up
to you.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.438
- Oh, you don't have to.
- No, no. I insist!

15:40.440 --> 15:43.174
After the pace of my tune-up
forced you to ride

15:43.242 --> 15:45.576
In that mangiapatate's truck--
<i>mamma mia!</i>

15:45.578 --> 15:47.445
- Sebastian is hardly
an idler.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.113
He's a carpenter,
and a pretty good one.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.716
- Oh. Yeah?

15:53.653 --> 15:56.454
How about
I take you for a drive

15:56.522 --> 16:00.058
So you can see what it's like
to ride behind the wheel
of a real car?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.859
- Mm, I would love that.

16:01.927 --> 16:04.095
But first I have
a murder to solve.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.733
(chuckling)

16:08.801 --> 16:11.268
- So, how does it feel,
knowing your work

16:11.337 --> 16:13.805
Helped free an innocent man?
- Good, yeah.

16:13.873 --> 16:17.208
Great, actually,
but my work isn't done

16:17.276 --> 16:19.010
Just 'cause ernie logan's
out of jail.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.011
- What do you mean?
- Detective lyle

16:21.081 --> 16:23.080
Fabricated evidence
to put logan behind bars

16:23.149 --> 16:24.782
And I won't rest
until I've proven it.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.618
- Well, how are you
going to do that?
- Well, I, uh,

16:27.686 --> 16:30.755
Got a pal on the inside.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.657
- Do you mean me?
- Well, who else?

16:33.726 --> 16:37.294
All I need is proof he accessed
the mayfield evidence

16:37.363 --> 16:39.097
After logan
was arrested.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.766
I thought you could
have a look at the logbook?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.702
- Oh, I don't have
access to that.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.237
- Well, not officially,
maybe, but...

16:47.307 --> 16:49.841
Sure you could manage a peek?

16:51.343 --> 16:54.178
- Steven, you're asking me
to take an awfully big risk.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.547
- I know.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.385
So, what do you say?

17:01.387 --> 17:04.622
Will you have a look
at the evidence log for me?

17:07.260 --> 17:09.594
- I'll see what I can do.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.262
- Hm.

17:13.332 --> 17:16.400
- Mr. Harper? Trudy clarke,
I'm a private detective.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.269
I'm covering christine
mayfield's case.

17:18.337 --> 17:21.005
Can I ask you a few questions?
- Yeah, sure,

17:21.073 --> 17:24.608
If you make it quick. My boss
considers 15 minutes
a lunch hour, eh?

17:24.677 --> 17:26.878
(chuckling)

17:26.880 --> 17:28.879
- I'm sure you being
so close to christine,

17:28.948 --> 17:30.881
This retrial must be
stirring things up.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.816
- Mostly things
I'm trying to forget.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.219
- What made the police
suspect you?

17:35.221 --> 17:38.790
- Let's just say I'm the jealous
type. Christine was a flirt.

17:40.025 --> 17:42.493
- You two fought.
- All the time.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.830
She said being charming to the
men at her perfume counter

17:45.898 --> 17:47.765
Was part of the job.
It got them

17:47.833 --> 17:50.033
To buy more for
their sweethearts.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.769
- But you didn't believe that.
- Not a word.

17:52.839 --> 17:56.107
She got that job and thought
she was too good for me.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.576
She was all fancy.
Best restaurants,

17:58.578 --> 18:02.046
Spending money on clothes,
dry cleaning. Stupid stuff.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.915
I tried to better myself.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.384
I went to night school
for piano tuning...

18:07.386 --> 18:09.253
Nothing changed.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.656
- Bet that made you mad.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.526
- I didn't kill her, if that's
what you're getting at.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.662
- Do you have an alibi?

18:17.730 --> 18:20.531
- Christine didn't show up
for our date the night she died.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.200
Thought she was with another
man, so I went and drowned
my sorrows.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.503
- Where?
- A speakeasy on shuter.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.672
What's with all the questions?

18:28.741 --> 18:30.942
Who are you working for?
- Christine's uncle,

18:31.010 --> 18:33.744
Derek walston, he hired us.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.881
- Nice try. Christine
doesn't have an uncle.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.751
Whoever you are, just stay away
from me, all right?

18:49.428 --> 18:52.029
- If walston isn't christine's
uncle, then who is he?

18:52.097 --> 18:54.632
- More importantly,
why did he hire us to
investigate her murder?

18:54.634 --> 18:57.301
- I don't know. He must be
connected in some other way.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.473
Who locks their garden shed?

19:04.577 --> 19:06.377
- Someone with more
to hide than tools.

19:20.193 --> 19:23.461
Time to take a look?
- You read my mind.
Care to join me?

19:23.463 --> 19:25.463
- As much as I love
a musty old shed,

19:25.531 --> 19:28.065
I gotta check on harper's alibi
for the night christine
was killed.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.268
- Good luck.
- You too.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.985
- What are you doing
in here, shaw?

19:49.022 --> 19:51.888
- Oh, nothing.
Just doing a little dusting,

19:51.958 --> 19:54.125
Keeping busy, you know.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.227
Oh, is that the mayfield
evidence box?

19:56.295 --> 19:59.763
- I'm testifying at the retrial.
Need to refresh my memory.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.499
- Didn't mcintosh tell you
to keep away from that case?

20:02.568 --> 20:04.702
- What are you, his spy now?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.837
- No. No, not at all.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.839
- I sure hope not.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.642
Guys like mcintosh?
They're old school.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.778
Can't teach you
like I can, shaw.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.315
- Speaking of teaching,

20:17.383 --> 20:20.317
I was wondering about the beer
bottle that was found

20:20.386 --> 20:22.586
So close to poor
miss mayfield's body--

20:22.588 --> 20:24.655
The one with logan's
fingerprints all over it.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.259
- What about it?
- Logan was the delivery driver
for the bootlegger,

20:28.327 --> 20:31.862
So wouldn't his fingerprints be
on a lot of beer bottles?

20:31.930 --> 20:33.530
- What are you getting at?

20:33.599 --> 20:36.200
- Oh, I'm just interested in how
it proves he's the killer,

20:36.202 --> 20:38.135
That's all.
- Alone, it doesn't.

20:38.203 --> 20:41.005
But you add in the boot prints

20:41.073 --> 20:43.941
And the eyewitness?
That's a home run.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.710
- Hm.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.678
- You're asking
a lot of questions.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.682
- No, no, I'm just seizing
the opportunity to learn.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.385
Sorry for bothering you.

21:01.194 --> 21:03.995
- Shall we?

21:08.167 --> 21:10.167
You look lovely.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.841
Beautiful day.

21:33.859 --> 21:36.327
(mysterious music)

22:37.590 --> 22:39.156
(suspenseful music)

22:48.601 --> 22:50.801
- Here you go.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.270
- Do you remember a woman
named maude vickers?

22:53.338 --> 22:56.006
I believe she used to work here.
- Yes, I remember maude.

22:56.074 --> 22:58.475
We used to work in the kitchen
together. I was shocked

22:58.544 --> 23:01.011
When she took her life.
- What can you tell me
about her?

23:01.079 --> 23:03.948
- Well, she wasn't in toronto
long. She didn't like it here.

23:04.016 --> 23:07.083
She was nervous, always
looking over her shoulder.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.086
- Do you have any idea
what she was nervous about?

23:09.088 --> 23:11.755
- No. Although
there was an older man

23:11.824 --> 23:14.224
Who would sometimes loiter by
the back door when maude
was working.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.960
- Was this him?

23:16.028 --> 23:18.095
- Yes, I think so.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.096
What's this all about,
frankie?

23:20.166 --> 23:22.633
- That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

23:27.773 --> 23:30.975
- Extensor carpi
radialis brevis...

23:31.043 --> 23:33.511
Extensor digiti minimi...

23:33.513 --> 23:35.645
Palmaris brevis...

23:35.715 --> 23:38.182
- You know I never mind being
your anatomical guinea pig,

23:38.250 --> 23:40.451
But what can you tell me
about maude vickers?

23:40.453 --> 23:43.053
- Maude vickers. Found
drowned in small's pond,

23:43.055 --> 23:45.389
July 21st, 1919.

23:45.457 --> 23:48.058
Ruled a suicide,
but I'm not so sure.

23:48.127 --> 23:51.328
- Why's that?
- The water in her lungs had
no bacterial content in it.

23:51.397 --> 23:54.398
- Water from a pond would have
bacteria from the algae.
- Exactly.

23:54.466 --> 23:57.534
It seemed like municipal water
to me. There's no way she
drowned in any pond.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.904
- It wasn't a suicide.
Can you do me a favour

24:00.973 --> 24:02.873
And pull christine mayfield's
lab results?

24:02.941 --> 24:05.543
- Sure. You think
the two cases are related?

24:07.246 --> 24:10.747
Ok, let's see here...

24:10.749 --> 24:13.884
This is, no-- uh...

24:15.521 --> 24:18.622
The sample is crystal clear.
There's no bacterial content.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.893
- Both women are small-boned,

24:22.962 --> 24:25.162
Brunette. They look a lot alike.

24:25.231 --> 24:28.632
- So, it's possible--
- christine wasn't
the killer's first victim.

24:36.442 --> 24:40.076
What's the common denominator?
- Well, sometimes a similar look
is enough for a killer.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.314
- So, you still suspect walston?
- He did lie about being
christine's uncle.

24:43.382 --> 24:46.049
- Well, that's not a crime
and neither is keeping
newspaper clippings.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.652
- No, but keeping them in secret
is a little bit suspicious.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.854
Plus, ai lin said that he was
hanging around quon's

24:50.923 --> 24:52.856
During the time that maude
was working there.

24:52.858 --> 24:55.326
- All right, let's say he did
kill her. Why shine a light

24:55.328 --> 24:57.794
On himself by hiring us to
investigate christine's murder?

24:57.863 --> 25:00.464
- So logan goes back to jail
and he's off the hook.

25:00.532 --> 25:03.000
- I don't buy it.
Harper, on the other hand.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.069
- The jealous boyfriend.
- I checked his alibi.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.137
No one can confirm it.
And the beer

25:07.205 --> 25:09.072
That they found at the crime
scene-- it's his brand.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.175
- So, what's his connection
to maude?

25:11.243 --> 25:13.377
- Well, it's not a rabbit,
frankie, but I got something.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.345
- A rabbit?
- Oh, you had to be there.

25:15.414 --> 25:18.215
I think I figured out what
christine was tied up with.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.751
Piano wire. That helpful?

25:20.819 --> 25:23.721
- Sure is. Harper was studying
to be a piano tuner.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.690
- Ah! Sounds like a fit to me.
- Not necessarily. This looks

25:26.692 --> 25:28.959
<i> Like the same wire</i>
<i>that I saw in walston's shed.</i>

25:29.028 --> 25:31.661
- Oh, it's used for all kinds of
things. My father tied his lures

25:31.731 --> 25:33.897
With it. "good for toothy fish,"
he used to say.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.700
- My money is still on the piano
tuner. I'm gonna go talk
to harper.

25:36.769 --> 25:39.736
- I'll go talk to walston.
- Be careful, both of you.

25:39.805 --> 25:42.373
Whoever used this on christine
is a dangerous man.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.245
- Excuse me. Is dan--?
- Hey! I thought I told you
to stay away from here.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.247
- Is that how you grabbed
christine before you tied her up

25:50.316 --> 25:52.316
In the park that night?
- What the hell are you
talking about?

25:52.384 --> 25:55.386
- Christine was tied up
with piano wire.
Isn't that convenient?

25:55.454 --> 25:57.721
- I told you I had nothing
to do with what happened.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.924
Yeah, we fought,
but I loved her.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.792
I thought we were gonna get
married until she won
that competition.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.996
- What competition?
- When we met,

26:05.998 --> 26:09.199
Christine was working in the
kitchen at mr. Eaton's
restaurant.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.267
He had a contest
to promote some perfume;

26:11.337 --> 26:13.404
She won and then got
all high and mighty.

26:13.472 --> 26:16.273
- Look, that's a nice story,
but you're not off the hook.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.141
You have means and motive.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.276
- You need to leave me alone.

26:20.346 --> 26:23.680
Things could get really rough
for you, you hear me?

26:23.749 --> 26:26.016
- I'd be careful if I were you.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.919
A man could get arrested
for threatening a lady.

26:39.631 --> 26:43.033
- I like steven, I do...
- But?

26:43.102 --> 26:45.702
- But, I'm afraid lyle
might be on to me

26:45.771 --> 26:49.506
And, I don't know, something
about it just feels wrong, flo.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.908
- But you break the rules
for frankie all the time.

26:51.977 --> 26:53.444
- That's different.
- How so?

26:53.512 --> 26:56.513
- Frankie's a friend.
- What's steven? A basa fish?

26:56.515 --> 26:58.315
- No.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.784
But that's just my point!
I don't know what he is.

27:00.853 --> 27:03.987
I could-- I could just be a
source of information for him.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.590
- Well, first of all,
no one takes "just a source

27:06.592 --> 27:08.659
Of information" for dinner
at chez rudolpho.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.260
- I suppose.

27:10.262 --> 27:13.864
- And let's forget steven
for a second. Just go with me:

27:13.932 --> 27:17.334
If there's a detective
at the station who's crooked,
don't you want to know?

27:17.403 --> 27:19.936
- Well, of course I do!
- And just because you look
at the logbook

27:20.005 --> 27:22.472
Doesn't mean you have to tell
steven what you saw.

27:22.541 --> 27:24.741
- So, you think
I should lie to him?

27:24.810 --> 27:27.677
- Oh, no, I'm not saying that.
- I don't get it.

27:27.747 --> 27:30.080
- Well, I'm just saying
take it a step at a time.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.816
Ew. Blech!

27:37.690 --> 27:39.657
(suspenseful music)

27:48.534 --> 27:50.701
- Ok.

27:50.703 --> 27:54.238
Logan was arrested on may 10th.

28:06.619 --> 28:09.820
Oh! Oh, so--I am so sorry, sir.

28:09.888 --> 28:11.654
I was just lost in my thoughts.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.024
- Hm. What seems to be
the trouble?

28:16.595 --> 28:19.129
- Detective, what
would happen, say,

28:19.198 --> 28:22.199
If it was discovered that an
officer had planted evidence?

28:23.736 --> 28:25.335
- Well,

28:25.337 --> 28:27.203
Do you believe such a thing
is happening, mary?

28:27.273 --> 28:29.272
- No, I'm not--
I'm not saying that.

28:29.341 --> 28:32.209
It's--it's just been on my mind
since you told detective lyle

28:32.211 --> 28:34.478
To keep away from
the mayfield case,

28:34.480 --> 28:37.281
And with the retrial
coming up and all...

28:37.349 --> 28:39.349
- I'm impressed
with your concern, mary,

28:39.418 --> 28:41.151
But you needn't worry.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.154
The I's are all dotted and t's
are all crossed on that one.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.156
I made sure myself.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.758
- Well, that is a relief.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.827
All right, well, thank you.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.397
Good night, sir.

28:59.104 --> 29:01.505
(lively music)

29:03.041 --> 29:05.843
<i>- I've terminated our business</i>
<i> arrangement, miss drake,</i>

29:05.911 --> 29:07.911
So why did you drag me away
from my dinner table?

29:07.980 --> 29:10.914
- Did you kill maude vickers
because she refused
your advances?

29:10.983 --> 29:13.884
- I don't know who or what
you're talking about.

29:13.952 --> 29:16.320
- What about christine mayfield?
Did she remind you of maude?

29:17.889 --> 29:20.657
- I don't need
to listen to this.
- You tried to use me.

29:20.725 --> 29:23.393
You wanted me to get logan
convicted to get you
off the hook.

29:23.395 --> 29:25.729
- No. I wanted logan convicted

29:25.797 --> 29:29.266
Because he murdered both of
them, christine and maude!

29:32.137 --> 29:34.871
Maude...

29:34.940 --> 29:36.907
My lovely girl.

29:39.612 --> 29:43.147
- You two were lovers.
- She was such a gentle soul.

29:46.151 --> 29:48.752
And she's dead because of me.

29:51.223 --> 29:54.925
- Why don't you sit down
and tell me what happened?

30:03.101 --> 30:05.836
- Maude told me
about some...

30:05.838 --> 30:08.705
Laundry man who was
delivering to quon's

30:08.773 --> 30:11.408
Who was following her.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.913
I said it was her imagination.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.515
I dismissed her concerns.

30:20.719 --> 30:23.954
And she was found dead
in that pond the next day.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.991
They said it was suicide,

30:28.060 --> 30:30.059
But I never believed them.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.929
- Did you go to the police?
- No.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.199
I was worried that
if our affair came out

30:36.268 --> 30:38.134
It would jeopardise my marriage.

30:38.203 --> 30:42.072
And, by then, it wasn't as if
that would bring back maude.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.341
But then--
- the same thing
happened to christine.

30:44.409 --> 30:47.611
- In the exact manner
that happened to my maude.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.479
I knew it was the same man.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.982
- Logan.
- Yes. He was the delivery man

30:52.050 --> 30:53.951
That was making maude afraid.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.486
I was positive that he had
killed them both,

30:56.554 --> 30:59.423
But I needed the police
to be able to prove it.

30:59.491 --> 31:02.826
- So, what did you do?
- I confided in a police officer

31:02.895 --> 31:06.429
That I knew from church. I told
him the story, he believed me.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.832
He got logan arrested,

31:08.901 --> 31:11.034
But the case against him

31:11.103 --> 31:13.370
Wasn't strong enough to
guarantee a conviction.

31:14.239 --> 31:16.840
- So he planted evidence.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.978
What was this officer's name?

31:21.046 --> 31:22.913
- I--I couldn't give you that.

31:22.915 --> 31:25.916
- Well, then, I can't help you.
- Please, miss drake,

31:25.918 --> 31:28.251
I know I don't deserve it,

31:28.320 --> 31:30.687
But I am begging for your help.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.326
- If you won't tell me the
officer's name who planted
the evidence,

31:36.328 --> 31:37.994
The only other thing you can do

31:38.063 --> 31:40.230
Is go to the police and tell
them what happened to maude.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.202
- And do you really think
that will help convict logan?

31:45.204 --> 31:46.870
- I do.

31:49.074 --> 31:52.776
- Then I will speak up
for maude.

31:54.279 --> 31:57.814
And if that's the end
of my marriage, so be it.

31:57.883 --> 32:00.683
- Look, just go home,
talk to your wife.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.754
She might be more accepting
than you realise.

32:03.756 --> 32:06.390
Come back here tomorrow and
we'll go the police together.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.694
- Thank you, miss drake.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.562
I'll be here by eleven.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.097
- Ok.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.070
- Miss clarke.
- Mr. Walston.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.108
What was that about?
- It's a long story.

32:25.177 --> 32:27.044
Pour yourself a drink.

32:27.112 --> 32:30.047
(exhaling)

32:30.115 --> 32:32.582
- So, logan killed both of them?
- Looks like it.

32:32.650 --> 32:36.053
That's why we need to make sure
he gets nailed at the retrial.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.589
- Need to start over.
- I've asked mary to take
another look at the evidence

32:39.658 --> 32:41.658
To see what's legit
and what's not.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.727
I'm gonna go back
to the laundry and have
another chat with logan.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.729
- All right. I'll try
connie again.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.799
We should really get some
information about that first
murder of maude vickers.

32:48.801 --> 32:51.534
- That's why walston's statement
is so critical.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.004
(mysterious music)

32:58.477 --> 33:00.077
(grunting)

33:09.754 --> 33:13.090
- Checking to make sure the I's
are dotted on the evidence
you planted?

33:13.092 --> 33:15.325
- What?
- You entered that boot print
into evidence.

33:15.394 --> 33:18.161
I saw the logbook.
- Yeah, I collected

33:18.229 --> 33:20.363
The boot prints. What's that got
to do with planting evidence?

33:20.432 --> 33:22.566
- They were made three days
after christine mayfield

33:22.634 --> 33:25.101
Was killed, that's what.
(chuckling)

33:25.170 --> 33:28.037
- You're letting your
imagination run away, mary.

33:28.107 --> 33:31.708
Besides, no one could know
something like that.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.512
- That's where you're wrong,
detective mcintosh.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.248
That boot print you collected
has manure in it

33:38.316 --> 33:40.383
And the groundskeeper
at the park only fertilises

33:40.385 --> 33:42.352
Once a year, on may 12th.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.723
- You don't understand.
- I think I do.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.392
- Christine mayfield
wasn't logan's first victim.

33:49.461 --> 33:52.796
Five years ago, he murdered
a woman not much older than you.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.932
He's a cold-blooded killer.
- He still deserves
a fair trial.

33:55.934 --> 33:58.468
- Nothing about police work
is straightforward, mary.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.470
You'll learn that with time.

34:02.541 --> 34:05.475
- If planting evidence is
your brand of police work...

34:06.778 --> 34:09.679
I'm not sure you should be
a member of this force.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.015
- What are you saying, mary?

34:12.084 --> 34:14.851
You're not going
to report me, are you?

34:18.891 --> 34:22.459
- And let's try again. Maybe
this time, close your eyes.

34:26.832 --> 34:28.898
- You're wasting your time.
I don't remember

34:28.967 --> 34:30.934
Anything new
about that night.

34:33.505 --> 34:36.706
- You and christine are
walking towards the park.

34:36.775 --> 34:40.243
It's twilight.
You see a little.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.578
- Yes. Things on the street

34:42.648 --> 34:44.648
Look more like shapes
than clear objects.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.850
- That's all right.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.619
Now, what do you remember?

34:49.621 --> 34:51.721
- Um...

34:51.790 --> 34:54.924
A couple leave the park.

34:54.993 --> 34:57.794
They have a dog, a terrier.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.929
- Good. Which way
are they walking?

34:59.998 --> 35:02.465
- I don't know.
I can't see them now.
- Why not?

35:02.467 --> 35:05.068
- There's a truck
parked in the way.

35:05.070 --> 35:06.736
- Towards the entrance
to the park?

35:06.805 --> 35:08.605
- Yes.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.141
- Any markings
on the truck?

35:11.143 --> 35:14.410
- It's black.
And I think...

35:14.479 --> 35:17.079
There are sacks
in the back.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.449
- Ok. Now,
what's in them?

35:20.619 --> 35:22.352
- Flour?

35:22.354 --> 35:24.020
Or...

35:24.088 --> 35:25.688
No.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.691
I think it's laundry.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.898
I'd forgotten all about the dog
and the truck.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.833
- Hm.
- Was that helpful?

35:36.901 --> 35:40.436
- Very. Thanks, connie.

35:40.505 --> 35:43.974
- So, mr. Logan's not here?
- No, thank god.

35:44.042 --> 35:46.109
- He does seem like
a bit of a creep.

35:46.177 --> 35:48.344
- Aren't they all?

35:48.413 --> 35:50.647
- Did he leave any
of his things here?

35:50.649 --> 35:53.717
- Sure. Mr. Thistlewood never
even cleaned out his locker.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.853
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- If you're quick.

35:56.922 --> 36:00.790
- Yeah.
- Hey, did he really
kill that girl?

36:02.361 --> 36:04.794
- I can't say.

36:04.862 --> 36:07.631
But if I were you,
I'd look for another job.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.834
- Follow me.

36:19.144 --> 36:21.545
That sty's his. It's not locked.

36:36.828 --> 36:39.663
(suspenseful music)

36:44.436 --> 36:46.970
He and mr. Thistlewood
liked to go fishing.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.606
Take off to the don and
leave me with everything.

36:50.575 --> 36:52.475
- My father tied
his lures with it.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.511
"good for toothy fish,"
he used to say.

37:04.189 --> 37:07.590
- That's funny.
- Why's that?

37:07.659 --> 37:11.228
- Ernie doesn't drink gin.
Says it's a lady's drink.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.665
- Connie remembered seeing
a laundry delivery truck

37:15.667 --> 37:17.600
At the scene.
It's something. You?

37:17.669 --> 37:20.202
- Found some piano wire and
a half-empty bottle of gin

37:20.272 --> 37:23.073
In logan's locker. I'm guessing
christine's fingerprints are
going to be all over it.

37:23.141 --> 37:26.009
- Ok, so far so good.
All we need is mr. Walston.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.944
Where is he?
- He should've been here by now.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.879
- You think his wife talked him
out of giving a statement?

37:29.881 --> 37:32.749
- He seemed pretty adamant about
coming forward, even if it did
wreck his marriage.

37:32.817 --> 37:35.752
- Well, we need him here.
He's the key to nailing logan.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.521
- Maybe we aren't the only ones
who know that?

37:41.693 --> 37:44.694
(dramatic music)

37:44.763 --> 37:47.697
- What's your plan here, logan?
- You're looking at it.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.633
- This won't help you.
- It's a little late

37:50.635 --> 37:52.569
To pretend you care
about what's good for me.

37:52.637 --> 37:56.172
- You won't get away with it.
Shooting a respectable man

37:56.240 --> 37:58.775
Isn't the same as faking
a poor girl's suicide.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.844
- Shut up!
- Why are you doing this?

38:00.846 --> 38:03.379
- You know why, walston!
- Please, just let me go.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.849
- I can't do that.
If you'd just left me alone--

38:05.917 --> 38:08.451
- You killed the woman I loved.
- I didn't kill anyone!

38:08.520 --> 38:10.520
Until now.
- Don't.

38:10.588 --> 38:12.922
- Why not? You're not going
to stop dogging me

38:12.991 --> 38:15.424
Until I'm at the end of a noose,
isn't that right?

38:15.494 --> 38:18.328
Why couldn't you just
let me live my life?

38:18.396 --> 38:20.663
- Put the gun down, mr. Logan.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.332
- You.
- I said put it down.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.934
- You're as bad has he is.
- We can talk about this calmly.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.970
- You're both railroading me!

38:29.173 --> 38:31.107
- Stop!

38:32.944 --> 38:34.377
- Frankie!

38:37.716 --> 38:40.316
- Don't do it.
- No.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.420
Let him.

38:43.422 --> 38:46.222
He won't stop hounding me.
- You killed maude!

38:46.290 --> 38:49.392
An innocent girl.
And then another?

38:49.461 --> 38:51.695
- I did not.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.963
I only ever saw that girl once!

38:53.965 --> 38:56.299
And christine?
I never laid eyes on.

38:56.367 --> 38:58.501
- So, you admit
to seeing maude vickers?
- Sure, dropping off stuff

38:58.570 --> 39:00.936
For quon's.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.305
Bert told me hands off.

39:03.375 --> 39:06.142
Look, I only saw
that girl one time.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.946
And then she was dead.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.317
- Here.

39:18.256 --> 39:22.325
- Frankie, christine's boyfriend
said something funny. He said

39:22.327 --> 39:25.595
That she spent lots
of money on dry cleaning.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.198
Didn't think
much of it until--

39:28.200 --> 39:30.867
- He and mr. Thistlewood
liked to go fishing,

39:30.935 --> 39:32.535
Take off to the don
and leave me with everything.

39:35.673 --> 39:37.139
- It wasn't him.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.808
- But...

39:40.044 --> 39:42.211
- Give me the gun, ok?

39:42.280 --> 39:44.681
It wasn't him.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.817
Don't let them leave.

39:51.022 --> 39:54.824
- You sure I can't convince you?
Couple days in niagara falls.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.494
No one need be the wiser.
- No, thank you.

39:58.663 --> 40:00.496
- You know, miss ohanian,
sometimes I wonder

40:00.565 --> 40:02.832
How much you value
your job.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.901
- Good thing
she values her life more.

40:07.105 --> 40:10.306
You should get out of here.
(scoffing)

40:10.375 --> 40:13.510
- What are you talking about?
- Maude vickers.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.044
Sweet young thing.

40:15.112 --> 40:17.780
She would come in here and
drop off things from quon's.

40:17.782 --> 40:21.050
Christine mayfield, she came
in here as well, and, you know,

40:21.118 --> 40:23.586
She looked a lot like maude.
- The police have the man
who killed her.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.021
- No, they have the man
that you framed.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.724
I think that you hinted
to mr. Walston

40:28.793 --> 40:31.127
That ernie was a bad egg.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.795
You planted the seed
that it was him

40:32.797 --> 40:34.764
And everyone looked exactly
where you wanted them to.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.534
- Prove it.
- I don't need to.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.935
There's more than enough
for the police to take
a good hard look at you

40:40.005 --> 40:42.005
And I don't think they're going
to like what they find. Do you?

40:49.380 --> 40:52.081
(gasping)
- oh...

40:53.518 --> 40:55.051
- That's one way
to press charges.

41:03.628 --> 41:06.596
- "laundry room lothario
murders two."

41:09.033 --> 41:11.901
I'm surprised the<i> workers</i>
<i> gazette</i> is in the murder
business.

41:11.970 --> 41:15.371
- Hey, even a socialist
has to pay the bills, huh?

41:16.841 --> 41:19.709
So, did you manage to have
a look at the logbook?

41:19.777 --> 41:22.378
I'm sure it was lyle that
planted that evidence.

41:22.447 --> 41:24.914
- I did, but...

41:24.982 --> 41:27.517
I wasn't able to find anything.

41:27.519 --> 41:29.986
It seems the cops closed ranks.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.255
- Huh.

41:32.323 --> 41:36.192
Same old story: Cops
covering for other cops.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.227
- I guess.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.796
Are we still on for Saturday?

41:40.865 --> 41:43.066
- Of course.

41:43.068 --> 41:45.168
You're my gal, aren't you?

42:01.219 --> 42:02.986
- For lyle. On the tab.

42:04.622 --> 42:07.357
Seems I screwed that one up.

42:07.359 --> 42:09.358
- Detective lyle. Hello.

42:09.427 --> 42:12.295
- Seems I was looking at the
wrong man the whole time.

42:12.297 --> 42:15.631
- Well, at least the right one's
free. Excuse me.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.100
- You hear about mcintosh?

42:18.169 --> 42:21.304
He resigned. Either that,
or he got fired.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.973
- Fired? Why?
- Seems he planted evidence.

42:24.042 --> 42:27.443
And someone found out.
- Oh, wow.

42:27.445 --> 42:30.747
I didn't know about that.
- Funny that. He says you did.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.452
Maybe I was right about you
investigating a fellow officer.

42:36.520 --> 42:40.723
Maybe I was just wrong about
the one you were investigating.

42:46.664 --> 42:48.598
- Impressive.
- Paid in full.

42:48.666 --> 42:51.000
- How'd it work out
with his wife?
- Well, he wanted to pay us

42:51.069 --> 42:54.269
Before his divorce went through.
- Good for her.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.739
- Hop in.
- You're kidding.

42:56.808 --> 42:58.741
- Alessandro wanted me
to see what it's like

42:58.810 --> 43:00.877
To drive a real car.

43:00.879 --> 43:02.945
- Wait, you know
how to drive this thing?

43:02.947 --> 43:04.881
- We'll find out.
(laughing)

43:11.889 --> 43:14.057
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
