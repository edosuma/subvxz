Pilot to navigator, where the heck are we?

01:13.417 --> 01:15.959
Six miles southwest of Cape Suzette.

01:16.041 --> 01:19.125
Smack in the middle
of some great cloud surfing.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.625
You're an ace, little britches.

01:21.709 --> 01:24.291
Don't know where I'd be without you.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.125
OK. Hit the mist.

01:45.083 --> 01:46.750
[yells]

02:07.417 --> 02:11.208
All right. Cool it, kid.
Don't go getting show-offity.

02:13.291 --> 02:14.750
Quit showing off!

02:14.834 --> 02:16.125
[thunder rumbles]

02:19.667 --> 02:22.959
Hey, mister, watch this!

02:30.083 --> 02:31.834
[thunder rumbles]

02:31.917 --> 02:37.125
Kit! Kit! No, no!

02:37.208 --> 02:38.417
[Kit] Guess who?

02:39.834 --> 02:44.458
Oh... doggonit, Kit. Don't you ever pull
a bonehead stunt like that again.

02:44.542 --> 02:46.417
I... I thought that you'd...

02:46.500 --> 02:48.542
I... I... I...

02:48.625 --> 02:49.542
You could've--

02:49.625 --> 02:53.333
Aw, Papa Bear, it was just a half-gainer
and a flying dismount.

02:53.417 --> 02:55.583
Oh, don't give me that fancy talk.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.917
You were just showing off
for that other show-off.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.458
-Come on, I knew what I was doing.
-What you were doing wasn't safe.

03:04.542 --> 03:07.166
[Kit]
Since when do you care about safe?

03:07.250 --> 03:09.709
Who flew two tons of dynamite
through a hurricane?

03:09.792 --> 03:11.583
[Baloo] That was a job.

03:11.667 --> 03:15.500
There's a difference
between that and taking chances.

03:16.667 --> 03:19.625
-[Kit] Oh, Baloo.
-[Baloo] You don't understand.

03:19.709 --> 03:22.959
There's chances and there's...
there's chances,

03:23.041 --> 03:26.208
and some of them just shouldn't be took.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.834
Are you writing
the Kit Cloudkicker rule book?

03:28.917 --> 03:30.875
What are you two arguing about?

03:30.959 --> 03:33.750
Aw, Papa Bear's turned into a mother hen.

03:33.834 --> 03:36.750
I was just doing a little cloud surfing.
And he says--

03:36.834 --> 03:40.417
Cloud surfing in this weather?
Isn't that dangerous?

03:40.500 --> 03:46.375
Yeah. What if you wiped out and fell down,
and bumped your head or something?

03:46.458 --> 03:49.208
[Kit groans] You're all against me!

03:49.291 --> 03:53.041
I knew what I was doing.
Won't anybody believe me?

03:57.667 --> 03:58.500
Hey!

03:58.583 --> 04:02.875
There you are, Ace.
Just the man I'm looking for.

04:02.959 --> 04:06.333
Oh, that was the greatest exhibition
of aerial stuntsmanship

04:06.417 --> 04:10.208
it has ever been
my privilege to behold.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.875
-It was?
-Oh. You mean you don't know?

04:13.959 --> 04:17.709
You, courageous captain of the clouds,
you were...

04:17.791 --> 04:19.834
Oh... great!

04:20.416 --> 04:22.625
Yeah, I guess I was.

04:22.709 --> 04:26.667
Now, hold on.
Who are you anyway?

04:26.750 --> 04:31.625
Dan Dawson of Daring Dan's
Dazzling Circus of the Air

04:31.709 --> 04:35.208
now at the Cape Suzette airdrome.
Three shows daily and matinees and...

04:35.291 --> 04:39.125
[gasps]
You must be the proud parents of Ace here.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.709
Me, married to him?

04:41.792 --> 04:45.166
Baloo and Becky aren't my folks.
I'm an orphan.

04:45.250 --> 04:49.083
Oh, you don't say? Me, too!

04:50.125 --> 04:53.750
-You ever been to an air circus?
-Uh, no I...

04:53.834 --> 04:58.709
Ho-ho-ho, my sky-skiing wonder boy,

04:58.792 --> 05:00.792
you haven't lived!

05:00.875 --> 05:02.750
On the house.

05:02.834 --> 05:06.792
You're a personal guest
of Daring Dan Dawson.

05:06.875 --> 05:09.166
Here's looking at you, Ace.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.709
Oh, brother!

05:16.166 --> 05:18.959
Wow! Did you see that, Baloo?

05:19.041 --> 05:21.417
Yeah, I saw it.

05:28.709 --> 05:32.542
Baloo, look!
Those guys are good.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.500
Thrilling. I'm one big goose bump
of excitement.

Yahoo! Did you see that, Baloo?

06:15.834 --> 06:19.750
Oh, that's nothing.
Hey, remember when we lost both engines

06:19.834 --> 06:23.208
over Spango-pango
and went into that dive?

06:23.291 --> 06:28.875
Ooh, 10,000 feet!
Baby, there was real danger.

06:29.417 --> 06:33.834
Then, pow! [laughs]
Blew the engine to macaroni.

06:33.917 --> 06:38.083
Boy, was Becky ever mad. [laughs]
Remember?

06:38.166 --> 06:40.083
Huh? Oh, yeah, sure.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.291
-Hey, Dan!
-[Dan] Hey, Ace!

06:43.375 --> 06:45.041
Oh, no.

-You were great!

06:49.959 --> 06:53.083
Oh... [chuckles] Takes one to know one.

06:53.166 --> 06:56.208
Ace, how'd you like to join my show?

06:56.291 --> 06:57.500
[clears throat]

06:57.583 --> 07:01.417
-Me?
-You. I'll make you a star.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.792
The roar of the crowd,
your name in lights.

07:03.875 --> 07:08.000
And more money
than you've ever dreamed of.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.500
-You think I'm that good?
-Uh, Kit...

07:10.583 --> 07:14.917
Hey, I know guys making three,
four, five hundred a week

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
not half as good as you.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.625
You're one in a million.

07:18.709 --> 07:21.750
You fly with me
and nothing will hold you down.

07:21.834 --> 07:26.083
-Kit, time to go.
-Except, of course, the little people.

07:26.166 --> 07:30.583
Kid, don't let the little people
hold you down,

07:30.667 --> 07:33.333
no matter how big they are.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.458
All right, kid. Come on.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.750
See you soon, Ace.

07:37.834 --> 07:38.959
[Kit] Real soon!

07:41.875 --> 07:45.041
[Kit making flying noises]

07:45.125 --> 07:47.375
Man, what a pilot!

07:47.458 --> 07:50.750
And then he asked me to join his show!

07:50.834 --> 07:55.291
Says I'm one in a million.
Dan says I'll make tons of money.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.750
And get my name up in lights.

07:57.834 --> 08:02.000
Hey, what do you think of Ace Cloudkicker?

08:02.083 --> 08:03.750
Well, good night, Ace.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.959
Man, you should've seen this one stunt.

08:07.792 --> 08:11.583
Dan goes into a stall, pretends his
plane's on fire, then he...

08:15.375 --> 08:18.792
Baloo, he's just... excited.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.625
I... I'm losing him, Becky.

08:21.709 --> 08:27.208
That Dippy Dan's a bag of hot wind
blowing Kit right out of my life.

08:27.291 --> 08:29.750
I know but Kit is talented.

08:29.834 --> 08:33.542
Maybe he's cut out for something better
than hauling cargo.

08:33.667 --> 08:37.000
And if he is,
who are we to hold him down?

08:37.082 --> 08:40.625
Then again I never knew you
to give up without a fight before.

08:40.708 --> 08:42.041
Yeah.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.125
Yeah!

08:44.625 --> 08:48.083
I'm... I'm gonna win that kid back.
Yeah!

08:48.166 --> 08:52.125
We'll spend tomorrow at Louie's
for some fishing and swimming and...

08:52.208 --> 08:55.792
[laughing]
Oh, man, is he going to be surprised!

08:56.291 --> 08:57.834
Good night, Baloo.

09:00.917 --> 09:03.041
[rooster crows]

09:03.417 --> 09:05.875
Rise and shinola, kid!

09:05.959 --> 09:09.166
Wait till you hear what we're doing today.
We're gonna...

09:12.417 --> 09:14.792
Kid? Hey, kid!

09:14.875 --> 09:19.625
Wildcat, what are you doing?
Kit and me are taking off in two minutes.

09:19.750 --> 09:24.250
You are? Well, Kit said,
"I'm going to the airfield."

09:24.333 --> 09:28.125
Come on. Gas her up.
Get her ready.

09:28.208 --> 09:32.125
Me and my partner got places to go
and things to do.

09:32.208 --> 09:34.542
Ah... Right, Baloo.

09:34.625 --> 09:39.375
He'll be back any second now.
Yes, sir, any second.

09:39.458 --> 09:41.000
Yee-ha!

09:48.917 --> 09:50.542
Whoopsie-daisy.

09:50.625 --> 09:55.458
-I slipped.
-Hey, that's what the people pay to see.

09:56.875 --> 10:01.125
[Kit] "Captain Kit Cloudkicker,
Ace of the Skies!"

10:01.208 --> 10:03.875
-Wow!
-Thought you'd like it.

10:03.959 --> 10:09.000
So, you want to join the show?
Make the big bucks, hmm?

10:09.083 --> 10:12.375
Yeah! I mean, I don't know.

10:13.458 --> 10:16.458
Me and Baloo, we're sort of partners.

10:16.542 --> 10:19.500
Um... can I think about it?

10:19.583 --> 10:23.041
Yeah, well, think fast, Ace.
We pull out tomorrow morning.

10:23.125 --> 10:27.000
If you want to come,
be at the airfield at dawn.

10:27.083 --> 10:28.583
Ah, here we are.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.500
Ready to show them
the new stunt I taught you?

10:30.583 --> 10:32.166
You bet.

10:38.709 --> 10:41.583
[muttering]

10:42.875 --> 10:47.083
Baloo, how about letting Wildcat
get back to work on the engines?

10:47.166 --> 10:50.750
-If Kit isn't showing up--
-He'll show up. He'll show up!

10:50.834 --> 10:53.291
Hey, he'll be dropping in any second.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.792
Man, when he's right, he's right!

10:57.875 --> 10:59.125
Kit?

11:00.125 --> 11:02.834
Kit!

11:25.500 --> 11:27.125
Wow!

11:27.375 --> 11:28.375
Pretty slick, huh?

11:28.458 --> 11:30.125
You... you... you...

11:30.208 --> 11:32.041
What were you doing?

11:32.125 --> 11:36.750
Dan and I call it
the Cloudkicker Dive to Doom.

11:36.834 --> 11:40.458
Hey, wait till we try it
in front of a real audience.

11:40.542 --> 11:42.917
Dan says they'll pay
big bucks to see me do...

11:43.750 --> 11:48.959
Uh, to see me...
Gee, I didn't scare you, did I?

11:49.041 --> 11:53.375
Scare? Kid, scare doesn't cover
half of it.

11:53.417 --> 11:56.875
Hey! Baloo, that's mine!

11:56.959 --> 11:59.917
Come on. Give it back! Baloo!

12:05.375 --> 12:09.333
[Kit] Look, I wasn't in any danger.
I knew what I was doing.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.583
[Baloo] And I'm telling you
there's no point

12:11.667 --> 12:14.041
in taking chances that shouldn't be took.

12:14.125 --> 12:18.792
How's 500 a week?! How's that for a point!
I'm going to be rich!

12:18.875 --> 12:23.834
Oh, kid, wake up.
You'll never see a dime.

12:23.917 --> 12:28.166
-That phony's all baloney.
-He is not!

12:28.250 --> 12:29.542
Dan was right.

12:29.625 --> 12:33.250
You're just one of those
big little people holding me down!

12:33.750 --> 12:37.083
Now, look,
he's filling your head with guava.

12:37.166 --> 12:41.792
He's a... [groans]
You just stay away from that guy!

12:42.166 --> 12:46.625
No! You can't tell me what to do!
You're not my dad!

12:47.208 --> 12:51.500
Now, kid, don't go and take it like that.
I was just...

12:51.583 --> 12:53.458
I mean... I...

12:53.875 --> 12:55.166
Kit?

12:56.083 --> 12:59.709
[sighs] Good night, little britches.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.500
[ringing]

13:10.250 --> 13:12.583
Help! Police!

13:12.667 --> 13:14.417
Kidnappers!

13:14.500 --> 13:16.375
Becky, Becky, call the cops!

13:16.458 --> 13:19.125
Hang on, Kit!
I'm coming for you!

13:19.208 --> 13:23.041
Baloo, he wasn't kidnapped. He left.

13:24.291 --> 13:28.083
-I think you know where he's gone.
-I do?

13:29.125 --> 13:30.875
Oh, no!

13:36.041 --> 13:37.917
Kit? Kit?

13:39.333 --> 13:43.375
[man on PA]
<i>And now the star of our show, Daring Dan!</i>

13:43.458 --> 13:48.333
<i>And introducing his newest partner,</i>
<i>Kit Cloudkicker!</i>

13:48.417 --> 13:50.041
[crowd cheering]

13:50.125 --> 13:51.083
Partner?

13:51.166 --> 13:54.125
Hear that, Ace? They love you!

13:54.208 --> 13:57.417
[sighs]
I just wish Baloo could see me.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.500
Kit, no! Wait!

14:01.291 --> 14:04.792
Right, right. Here we go, Ace.
Can't keep your fans waiting.

14:04.875 --> 14:08.083
Kit! Kit!

14:11.041 --> 14:13.250
[coughing]

14:39.917 --> 14:42.625
Oh, Kit, no!

14:48.834 --> 14:53.250
[man on PA] <i>Don't worry, folks.</i>
<i>It's all part of the show!</i>

14:53.959 --> 14:57.667
<i>Let's hear it for that high-flying</i>
<i>ace of the skies,</i>

14:57.750 --> 15:00.333
<i>Kit Cloudkicker!</i>

15:02.458 --> 15:05.375
Who am I kidding? They love him.

15:13.709 --> 15:14.875
[crowd cheering]

15:14.959 --> 15:17.041
[Baloo] Maybe Becky was right.

15:17.208 --> 15:21.208
Maybe the kid is cut out
for something special,

15:21.291 --> 15:27.041
something better than hauling cargo
with a fat, stupid old bear like me.

15:27.125 --> 15:31.208
So long, kid. I knew you when.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.458
[Dan sighs] What did I tell you, partner?

15:36.542 --> 15:40.583
When Dan says big bucks, he means big.

15:40.667 --> 15:43.709
Oops. Forgot your share.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.417
Is this all I get? You said--

15:47.500 --> 15:52.542
Hey, hey, hey. You got your dressing room
to pay for and your new uniform.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.208
It all adds up, Ace.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.834
Uh, of course,
you could pay it off sooner,

15:58.917 --> 16:02.750
if you gave the room something
they'd really pay for,

16:02.834 --> 16:06.959
like, oh, I don't know, a new stunt.

16:07.041 --> 16:08.792
New stunt?

16:08.875 --> 16:12.083
Great idea, Ace! New stunt.

16:12.166 --> 16:15.667
I call it the Flaming Tunnel of Fear!

16:15.750 --> 16:19.709
What do you think, Ace?
Is this going to wow the rubes or not?

16:19.792 --> 16:21.041
[gulps]

16:21.458 --> 16:25.375
Surf through all that fire?
I don't mind taking chances, but--

16:25.458 --> 16:30.208
Well, guess I figured you wrong, Ace.
Didn't think you were chicken.

16:30.291 --> 16:34.834
Who you calling chicken?
I'm Kit Cloudkicker, remember?

16:34.917 --> 16:38.959
Look, anything goes wrong,
and I'm toast.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.250
Ha! Nothing's going to go wrong.

16:41.333 --> 16:45.041
Old Dan here will have
everything under control.

16:45.166 --> 16:50.333
You want the big bucks, don't you?
The more danger, the more the dummies pay.

16:50.417 --> 16:53.709
You got to take
a little chance now and then.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.625
[sighs] OK, Dan. It's just that--

16:56.709 --> 17:00.750
Attaboy.
I knew I could count on you... partner.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.333
Wonder what you're up to tonight, Baloo.

17:06.416 --> 17:09.416
[sighs] Having fun, I bet.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.791
Nothing shipped in a week.

17:17.083 --> 17:20.333
We can't go on like this.
I'm gonna have to do something.

17:20.416 --> 17:22.416
I'm looking for a pilot named Baloo.

17:25.500 --> 17:31.125
-Your name Baloo?
-OK. I surrender. Lock me up.

17:31.208 --> 17:34.458
-I got nothing to live for anyway.
-Huh?

17:34.542 --> 17:38.583
You're... you're not here
about the parking tickets?

17:38.667 --> 17:41.917
No. Gathering information on this guy.
Know him?

17:42.000 --> 17:47.250
Dan Dawson, alias Dan Debronci,
alias Daring Dan, alias--

17:47.333 --> 17:50.625
What you want him for,
besides shooting off his mouth?

17:50.709 --> 17:54.542
We've heard stories people have been hurt
doing those crazy stunts of his.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.834
No proof yet,
so we're asking anybody who's seen--

17:57.917 --> 17:59.458
People hurt? Where is he?

17:59.542 --> 18:02.083
We'll be watching him
tomorrow in New Fedora.

18:02.166 --> 18:05.000
Gotta catch him in the act, see.
Now, if you...

18:05.083 --> 18:07.667
-Hey!
-Baloo, no!

18:08.083 --> 18:09.917
When I get through with that guy,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.875
he'll be able to
count all his teeth on one finger!

18:13.083 --> 18:14.875
[plane engine starts]

18:19.417 --> 18:22.500
[Dan groans]
What do you mean wait till later?

18:22.583 --> 18:24.250
The show's on now!

18:24.333 --> 18:27.208
The rubes have paid their money, sonny!

18:27.291 --> 18:29.959
But, Dan, there's a storm coming.

18:30.166 --> 18:35.458
Look, there's no point in taking chances
that... that shouldn't be took.

18:35.542 --> 18:39.041
Do the stunt, or you're fired, flyboy.

18:39.125 --> 18:40.875
How's that for a point?

18:41.208 --> 18:42.166
What?

18:42.250 --> 18:45.125
Come on, partner.
Can't keep your fans waiting.

18:45.208 --> 18:49.166
-Let's hit the clouds.
-Hit your own clouds, partner.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.834
You can't fire me. I quit!

18:51.917 --> 18:53.208
[thunder rumbles]

18:53.291 --> 18:57.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Silly me. Forget what I said.

18:57.542 --> 18:59.542
Bad Dan. Bad!

18:59.625 --> 19:02.333
Guys, cancel the stunt! <i>Finito!</i>

19:02.417 --> 19:05.875
See, no stunt. My fault.
You were right.

19:05.959 --> 19:08.500
I'm real sorry. You want to leave?

19:08.583 --> 19:12.834
It's OK. Anything.
Just, please, don't be mad at me.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.875
Well, uh...

19:16.750 --> 19:19.166
Ah, Ace, you're the greatest!

19:19.250 --> 19:21.709
You're not sore. I'm not sore.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.417
I know how it is.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.208
Listen... [clears throat]

19:26.291 --> 19:29.750
Since the show's over,
I got some time on my hands.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.834
How about I give you a ride home.

19:32.917 --> 19:36.375
One last flight for old times' sake?
Hmm?

19:36.458 --> 19:39.667
-OK.
-That's my boy!

19:45.458 --> 19:46.583
[thunder rumbles]

19:46.667 --> 19:48.625
[groaning]

19:51.458 --> 19:54.875
Oh, where's my navigator
when he needs me?

19:58.917 --> 20:02.208
[grunts] I guess I ought to give
this stuff back to you.

20:02.291 --> 20:08.000
Nah, keep it.
Call it a souvenir of your next stunt.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.834
Huh? You said you'd take me home.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.500
Light them.

20:16.417 --> 20:18.542
Dan, what are you going to do?

20:18.625 --> 20:23.500
[Dan] I'm not going to do anything, Ace.
You are. Fly or fall.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.709
It's all the same to the crowd.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.083
[yells]

20:27.166 --> 20:30.875
[man on PA] <i>Don't worry, folks.</i>
<i>It's all part of the show!</i>

<i>Flaming Tunnel of Fear!</i>

20:35.291 --> 20:36.375

20:52.542 --> 20:56.375

It's all part of the show!

[yells]

21:02.417 --> 21:03.291
Oh, Baloo.

21:03.375 --> 21:07.375
Now, now, you want to miss
the best part of the show?

Dan Debronci, alias et cetera, et cetera,
you're under arrest.

21:44.375 --> 21:47.500
Here's looking at you... Ace!

21:50.834 --> 21:55.583
Thanks for saving me, Papa Bear.
I'm sorry I left.

21:55.667 --> 21:58.417
If you'll have me back, I...

21:58.500 --> 22:01.166
[Baloo] Pilot to passenger,
you wouldn't know where

22:01.250 --> 22:03.792
I could find me
a good navigator, would you?

Navigator to pilot,
Cape Suzette straight ahead.

22:11.166 --> 22:16.083
