00:02.536 --> 00:03.869
(man on TV)
'And our next contestant
is Miss Tasmania.'

00:03.871 --> 00:06.405
'Okay, Miss Tasmania,
your question is'

00:06.407 --> 00:07.906
'what do you say
to people who claim'

00:07.908 --> 00:09.908
'you're merely
a beautiful face and body'

00:09.910 --> 00:11.276
'without a brain?'

00:11.278 --> 00:12.378
(Miss Tasmania)
'Thank you.'

00:12.380 --> 00:14.446
[audience applauding]

00:14.448 --> 00:15.881
What are you watching?

00:15.883 --> 00:19.084
I think it's
a United Nations meeting.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.919
That's not the United Nations.

00:20.921 --> 00:24.256
- It's a beauty pageant.
- Are you sure?

00:24.258 --> 00:27.059
A minute ago, they asked
the ambassador from Spain

00:27.061 --> 00:29.828
"What she would do
for world peace?"

00:29.830 --> 00:33.432
She's not the ambassador.
She's a contestant.

00:33.434 --> 00:38.037
Oh. Well, I guess that explains
why the ambassador from Sweden

00:38.039 --> 00:39.538
was juggling.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.411
[theme music]

01:01.595 --> 01:03.529
[music continues]

01:46.140 --> 01:47.606
[audience applauding on TV]

01:50.244 --> 01:53.979
On Melmac, the judges paraded
around in swimsuits

01:53.981 --> 01:57.583
while the contestants sat
in the audience.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.551
Well, why were the judges
in swimsuits

01:59.553 --> 02:01.553
and not the contestants?

02:01.555 --> 02:03.689
The judges had better bodies.

02:04.825 --> 02:08.127
Hey, Kate. I'd like
to see you do that.

02:08.129 --> 02:10.095
Plate spinning
was never my sport.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.566
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.702
Hey, you're home early.
Where's Rick?

02:16.704 --> 02:19.571
Yeah, where's that jerk
with the earring?

02:19.573 --> 02:22.040
He's still at the dance.

02:22.042 --> 02:25.744
- Honey, is something wrong?
- No-no, nothing is wrong.

02:25.746 --> 02:26.645
[crying]

02:26.647 --> 02:28.847
Lynn, what's the matter?

02:28.849 --> 02:31.216
ALF, will you turn
that thing off?

02:31.218 --> 02:33.719
But it's the losers'
production number.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.991
ALF, can't you see
that Lynnie is upset?

02:38.993 --> 02:40.759
Oh. Sorry.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.163
Lynn, what happened?

02:45.332 --> 02:46.632
Rick and I were at the dance.

02:46.634 --> 02:47.900
We're having a really good time

02:47.902 --> 02:49.701
and then Cindy Bennett
showed up.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.270
And Rick asked me
if he could dance with her.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.704
So I said, "I suppose."

02:52.706 --> 02:55.774
So, he danced with her,
the whole night!

02:56.710 --> 03:00.579
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.947
Cindy Bennett.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.850
Is that that blonde cheerleader
in your yearbook?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.385
Yeah.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.920
Wow!

03:09.723 --> 03:12.157
I mean, she's not
as pretty as you.

03:12.159 --> 03:14.426
Rick's a jerk
for doing what he did.

03:14.428 --> 03:17.029
You know, I don't even
blame him. Cindy is gorgeous.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.664
Any guy would want her
instead of me.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.599
- Oh, Lynn, that's not true.
- Yes, it is.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.234
Oh, honey, I know
that you're upset

03:22.236 --> 03:25.837
but you know, these kind
of things happen all the time.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.840
Great, you've given me
a lot to look forward to.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.910
That's not what I meant.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.712
Let-let me tell you
a little story

03:33.714 --> 03:35.247
that might make you
feel better.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.050
When I was in high school,
I was at this dance

03:38.052 --> 03:39.885
and this really cute-looking guy
came over

03:39.887 --> 03:41.453
and started
talking to me.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.921
Well, we spent
the whole evening together.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.624
It was wonderful
until I found out

03:45.626 --> 03:48.060
that he had left his date
to be with me.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.596
And?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.766
And even though
I kept dating him

03:54.768 --> 03:57.236
I always felt that
what he did was wrong.

03:58.973 --> 04:00.105
Thanks, mom.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.475
- I feel much better now.
- Sorry.

04:03.477 --> 04:07.279
Excuse me but what happened
to the girl who got dumped?

04:07.281 --> 04:08.947
It's not important.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.984
Well, not to you.
You got your guy.

04:14.288 --> 04:19.024
I think what your mother
is trying to say in her own..

04:19.026 --> 04:21.260
...special way..

04:21.262 --> 04:23.729
...is that, you know..

04:23.731 --> 04:25.063
...you're too good for Rick.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.266
Well, I didn't get that at all.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.334
It sounds to me
like she's being punished

04:29.336 --> 04:31.570
for something Kate did.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.473
Don't you have a pageant
to watch?

04:34.475 --> 04:37.042
I'm trying to help Lynn.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.379
Well, you're not.
Watch your TV show.

04:40.381 --> 04:44.683
Fine! If you need me, Lynn,
I'm here for you.

04:46.253 --> 04:48.487
Mom.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.322
Do you think I'm pretty?

04:50.324 --> 04:53.492
Oh. Well, of course, you are.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.961
You are a beautiful young girl.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.864
You have to say that,
you're my mother.

04:58.866 --> 05:02.200
Dad, if you were my age,
would you ask me out?

05:02.202 --> 05:06.738
Well, if I were your age
and you weren't my daughter

05:06.740 --> 05:10.008
and if I weren't married
and if I had a car back then--

05:10.010 --> 05:12.744
See? Dad won't even ask me out.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.746
- Willie..
- Of course, I would.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.815
Lynn, you're a wonderful girl.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.751
You've got a great personality.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.821
Thanks, dad.
That's the kiss of death.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.759
Lynnie.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.095
I suppose you're gonna
blame me for this.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.365
No, of course not.
This isn't your fault.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.068
I know. I just wanted
to hear you say it.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.072
Watch your pageant.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.306
[audience applauding on TV]

05:41.308 --> 05:44.109
Oh, hey, look!
There's John Candy.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.046
No, wait, that's Miss Bulgaria.

05:51.952 --> 05:55.754
Alright, what do you give me
for a Mickey Mackerel card?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.622
What are you guys doing?

05:57.624 --> 05:59.925
Trading bouillabaisseball cards.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.660
What's bouillabaisseball?

06:01.662 --> 06:03.228
It's baseball in Melmac.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.797
Instead of a ball
they throw fish guts.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.100
Fish parts.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.802
The guts are sold
at the concession stand.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.572
Sorry I asked.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.141
These are neat. Did they come
with bubble gum too?

06:16.143 --> 06:19.478
Yeah, two flavors
Tabby and Persian.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.813
[telephone rings]

06:21.815 --> 06:24.149
Hello? Yes?

06:25.119 --> 06:27.419
The Miss Southland Pageant?

06:27.421 --> 06:29.688
I-I'm sorry. I'm afraid
you must have the wrong number.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.323
No, that's for me.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.896
You'll have
to excuse Aunt Sophie.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.264
Sometimes she's here

06:39.266 --> 06:42.033
and sometimes we don't know
where she is.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.436
What's ALF doing?

06:44.438 --> 06:46.671
I think that he's entered
a beauty pageant.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.306
Shh!

06:48.308 --> 06:50.675
Yeah. Uh-huh.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.511
Yeah. Oh, great!

06:52.513 --> 06:54.212
Yeah, no problem!

06:54.214 --> 06:56.014
Thanks. Ta-ta.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.917
Are you gonna be Miss Southland?

06:58.919 --> 07:01.753
No, unfortunately,
the contest isn't open

07:01.755 --> 07:03.789
to professional models.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.757
I entered Lynn.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.159
What?

07:08.429 --> 07:10.362
Hold that thought, Kate.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.663
You're wearing that?

07:11.665 --> 07:14.866
There's a dress code
for taking out the garbage?

07:14.868 --> 07:16.701
Brian, take it out for her.

07:16.703 --> 07:20.305
Our little beauty shouldn't be
seen carrying trash.

07:20.307 --> 07:23.442
She was ugly enough
to take it out yesterday.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.145
- I'll give you a dollar.
- Okay.

07:27.147 --> 07:31.016
You owe Brian a dollar.
Lynn, you should change.

07:31.018 --> 07:34.186
The lady from Miss Southland
will be here any minute.

07:34.188 --> 07:38.557
- What are you talking about?
- Connect the dots here.

07:38.559 --> 07:42.093
I entered you
in the Miss Southland pageant.

07:42.095 --> 07:45.497
What? ALF, why would you do
something like that?

07:45.499 --> 07:47.566
Well, isn't it obvious?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.367
Tell her why, Kate.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.903
Because, he's an idiot!

07:51.905 --> 07:54.606
Thanks for clearing that up.

07:54.608 --> 07:58.577
Lynn, I saw how upset you were
after that dance thing.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.313
And I figured
if you won this contest..

08:01.315 --> 08:04.015
Hey, you'd feel better
about yourself.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.718
But why didn't you
ask me first?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.920
I was afraid you might say no.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.689
You were right.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.591
See, Kate, I'm not an idiot!

08:14.194 --> 08:16.228
I'm not entering
the contest, ALF.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.462
But, you'll win!

08:17.464 --> 08:19.364
ALF, I want you to call the
pageant people

08:19.366 --> 08:21.566
right this minute. Tell them
that Lynn is withdrawing.

08:21.568 --> 08:24.569
See, even my own mother knows
I wouldn't have a chance.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.105
Oh, real supportive, Kate.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.907
Honey, that's not what I meant.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.676
Look, I'm not exactly
beauty contest material.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.178
Sure you are! Hey!

08:33.180 --> 08:35.547
You should have heard what
they thought about your picture.

08:35.549 --> 08:36.815
What picture?

08:36.817 --> 08:39.317
The one from your
sweet 16 party.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.553
Oh, ALF, I looked terrible
in that picture!

08:41.555 --> 08:43.121
I still had my braces on.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.957
Don't worry.
I whited them out!

08:47.261 --> 08:49.194
Oh, great.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.097
Now, before the contest
coordinator gets here

08:52.099 --> 08:54.366
I think we should
go over your application.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.700
What application?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.402
The one on the desk.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.577
ALF, why did you say
my talent was clog dancing?

09:05.579 --> 09:09.881
Well, it's not singing.
I've heard you do that.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.851
I have never clog danced
in my life!

09:12.853 --> 09:15.453
Oh, it's easy.
I mean, what do you do?

09:15.455 --> 09:19.524
You just clog up a sink
and dance around it, right?

09:19.526 --> 09:22.894
ALF, you don't
clog up a sink to clog dance.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.262
Then, what's the name
of the dance

09:24.264 --> 09:26.798
where you do clog up a sink?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.266
There isn't one.

09:28.268 --> 09:31.269
Well, I suggest we call it
the funky ALF.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.173
I'm not sending in
that application.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.909
Well, too late.
They already have a copy.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.945
Forget the contest, ALF.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.113
Fine, give up the scholarship.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.517
- Scholarship?
- Give up the car!

09:45.519 --> 09:46.685
Car?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.020
What kind of a car?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.656
Well, I'll give you a hint.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.458
It's spelled with a Z.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.261
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to meet this woman.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.430
I think I'll go change.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.299
ALF, just what kind of car
is this?

10:01.301 --> 10:04.436
Used. That's spelled with a Z,
isn't it?

10:06.039 --> 10:07.639
[instrumental music]

10:09.309 --> 10:12.444
And that's not all that beauty
pageants have to offer.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.981
They also teach you about life,
help you develop poise

10:15.983 --> 10:20.318
and they lead to lots and lots
of wonderful opportunities.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.689
In fact many of our girls have
gone on to become hostesses.

10:24.691 --> 10:28.460
Not-not waitresses, mind you.
But hostesses.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.462
Oh.

10:30.464 --> 10:34.065
Of course I can't promise
you will become a hostess.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.967
I won't get my hopes up.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.269
Listen, do you really think
I have a chance of winning.

10:38.271 --> 10:41.940
Well, of course you do.
Oh, you're such a pretty girl.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.509
And you have such a lovely
smile.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.078
Although it doesn't seem quite
as bright

10:47.080 --> 10:49.314
as it does in your picture.

10:49.316 --> 10:53.418
Oh, Lynn's built up a bit of
plaque since then.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.186
I see.

10:55.188 --> 10:58.289
Oh, before I forget,
it says on your application

10:58.291 --> 11:00.659
that you're a clog dancer.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.395
Do you need any special
equipment for that?

11:03.397 --> 11:09.034
No. You just clog up a sink
and I'll dance around it.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.735
What?

11:10.737 --> 11:11.970
[laughing]

11:11.972 --> 11:14.839
Oh, oh, you're just joking.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.610
[chuckling]
Ah, there's never a dull moment
with ol' Lynn around.

11:18.612 --> 11:21.546
Well, I guess I have
all the information I need.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.148
I'd better be going.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.716
I start my shift in half an hour

11:24.718 --> 11:27.752
and customers won't know
where to sit if I'm not there.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.656
Oh, Miss Bartley, before you go

11:31.658 --> 11:33.124
can I ask you a question?

11:34.494 --> 11:38.563
If I don't win is there some
sort of a consolation prize?

11:38.565 --> 11:42.167
Oh, yes, each contest wins a
copy of the Miss Southland

11:42.169 --> 11:44.669
home game
and a big pumice stone.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.206
Oh, then I guess I can't lose.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.711
Right. Have a pretty day. Bye.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.579
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.883
Well, what do you think?

11:58.885 --> 12:01.052
Well, now that we know her,
she might give us a good table

12:01.054 --> 12:03.321
at the pizza bar.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.758
No, no, I mean what do you think
about me entering the pageant?

12:06.760 --> 12:09.828
Well, Lynn, you're not really
considering it, are you?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.529
Sure, why not?

12:11.531 --> 12:13.898
Well, I don't know,
I-I guess I always thought

12:13.900 --> 12:17.001
that beauty pageants were
demeaning to women.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.436
Well, maybe you're right, Willie

12:18.438 --> 12:20.338
but one contest
isn't gonna hurt her

12:20.340 --> 12:22.474
as long as she doesn't take it
too seriously.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.709
You're not gonna take it too
seriously, are you?

12:24.711 --> 12:27.779
Mom, I'm clog dancing for a
pumice stone.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.314
How serious can I be?

12:31.618 --> 12:36.621
I guess it could be fun, maybe
even a learning experience.

12:36.623 --> 12:41.259
- There's nothing to lose.
- Just the registration fee.

12:41.261 --> 12:45.363
- How much?
- $200.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.832
I guess you know what
my reaction's going to be.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.268
Yeah, but I don't think I care
to hear it.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.340
[instrumental music]

12:57.144 --> 13:00.178
Come on!
Keep those clogs moving!

13:00.180 --> 13:03.882
That's it! Pretend
you're mashing boll weevils.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.686
ALF, we're not
getting anywhere here.

13:08.688 --> 13:09.988
Sure we are.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.458
A week ago, we didn't even know
what clog dancing was.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.627
Now, we're both
sick to death of it.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.564
That's it.
I'm taking a rest.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.698
[music stops]

13:20.700 --> 13:22.133
There's no time!

13:22.135 --> 13:24.903
We only have six hours
until the pageant.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.938
My feet are killing me.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.640
Alright. Alright.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.943
We can work on your
saccharine smile, instead.

13:31.945 --> 13:36.581
No! No, please, no more smiling.
My face is gonna lock up.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.683
Great!

13:38.685 --> 13:40.819
ALF, you're taking this thing
way too seriously.

13:40.821 --> 13:44.389
- I wanted it to be fun.
- Hey, you know what's fun?

13:44.391 --> 13:46.958
Cramming for the interview
segment.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.995
Now I jotted down a few things
that the judges might ask.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.397
Oh, no.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.465
Let's start with the As.

13:54.467 --> 13:58.937
"What do Americans
and Australians have in common?"

13:58.939 --> 14:00.405
I don't know.

14:00.407 --> 14:03.007
Alright.
I'll give you this one.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.944
They both want world peace.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.948
Question number two.

14:09.950 --> 14:14.018
"What do Americans
and Albanians have in common?"

14:14.020 --> 14:15.753
They both want world peace?

14:15.755 --> 14:17.755
Very good.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.357
Question number three.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.292
- "What do Americans--"
- ALF!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.194
I don't want to go through
a zillion questions

14:23.196 --> 14:24.596
that are all the same.

14:24.598 --> 14:27.332
You don't want to do anything,
do you?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.267
Why do I even try?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.436
I mean, I go out of my way
to help someone

14:31.438 --> 14:34.405
through a rough period
and do they appreciate it?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.641
No, they just complain.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.143
You know,
maybe Dear Abby was right.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.379
Maybe I do care too much.

14:42.782 --> 14:47.218
Alright, ALF,
what's the next question?

14:47.220 --> 14:50.655
- Are you sure this time?
- Yes.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.923
Okay.

14:51.925 --> 14:56.094
"What do Americans and Alpha
Centaurians have in common?"

14:56.096 --> 15:01.599
- They both want world peace.
- No! Eaah! Wrong!

15:01.601 --> 15:05.336
The Alpha Centaurians
have world peace.

15:05.338 --> 15:09.707
- What they want is shoes.
- Shoes.

15:09.709 --> 15:13.344
Come on, now.
Think before you answer.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.547
Question number four.
"What do Americans.."

15:18.985 --> 15:22.520
I don't believe this, 96
stations, and not one of them

15:22.522 --> 15:25.790
is carrying
the Miss Southland pageant.

15:25.792 --> 15:30.261
- Well, what do you think?
- Oh, Lynn!

15:30.263 --> 15:34.599
You look...stunning!

15:36.169 --> 15:37.635
Thanks, daddy.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.737
Brian, don't you think
your sister looks pretty?

15:39.739 --> 15:42.874
If I say yes, am I gonna
have to take out the garbage?

15:42.876 --> 15:46.277
- No.
- Then I guess she's pretty.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.679
Thanks, Bri.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.414
So, dad, do you really think
I have a chance?

15:49.416 --> 15:51.716
Are you kidding?
You'll do great.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.319
Now, is this the same Willie
who said that beauty pageants

15:54.321 --> 15:55.720
were demeaning to women?

15:55.722 --> 15:57.922
Yeah, but that Willie didn't
have a daughter

15:57.924 --> 15:59.657
who's going to win!

15:59.659 --> 16:01.759
ALF, you haven't said anything,

16:01.761 --> 16:04.295
Please, Kate,
don't spoil the moment.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.930
What do you think, ALF?

16:05.932 --> 16:09.100
Well, as Grandma Shumway
used to tell me

16:09.102 --> 16:12.270
"If you don't have
anything nice to say to someone

16:12.272 --> 16:14.605
don't say anything at all."

16:14.607 --> 16:17.342
Then she never
spoke to me again.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.810
You don't think I look good?

16:18.812 --> 16:21.546
Well, not as good
as you usually do.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.682
- What do you mean?
- Let's take it from the top.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.585
Your hair.
What happened to it?

16:27.587 --> 16:30.521
I got a permanent.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.257
You mean, it's gonna
look like that forever?

16:33.259 --> 16:35.526
[chuckling]
No, no, just till it grows out.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.996
Yeah, that's what
they said about

16:37.998 --> 16:41.366
this orange dye job of mine.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.900
And that dress.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.436
You look like
you're 22 years old.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.171
I was hoping for 25.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.074
Why don't you go the distance
and try to look as old as Kate?

16:52.112 --> 16:55.680
You're gonna go the distance,
out the door.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.882
ALF, we think she looks nice.

16:57.884 --> 17:02.186
I do too, but she's lost
that natural glow.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.555
Now she just looks..

17:04.557 --> 17:06.224
...glamorous.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.992
I'll take that as a compliment.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.861
You know, maybe it's the makeup
and everything

17:09.863 --> 17:12.096
but I really think
that maybe I do have a chance.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.298
You know, I wanted
to take a photo of you guys

17:14.300 --> 17:18.302
but now I don't know if I could
fit all of Lynn's hair in it.

17:18.304 --> 17:21.439
- Well, let's give it a shot.
- Oh, good idea. Come on, Bri.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.574
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Right over here.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.877
Oh, wait a minute.
Uh, ALF, that's my new camera.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.612
Uh, maybe I should
show you how it works.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.714
If I can hot wire your car

17:29.716 --> 17:31.783
I can certainly work a camera.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.653
- You hot wired my--
- Will you stop talking?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.488
You'll ruin the picture.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.457
'Alright, come on,
everybody, get together.'

17:39.459 --> 17:41.192
And ready!

17:41.194 --> 17:45.163
One, two, three

17:45.165 --> 17:48.032
'four, five, six--'

17:48.034 --> 17:49.534
What are you doing?

17:49.536 --> 17:51.469
On Melmac, we count to 21

17:51.471 --> 17:53.438
before we take a picture.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.474
Come on, Lynn,
we'd better get going.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.042
We don't want to keep
those judges waiting.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.844
Sweetheart, we're gonna be back
in two hours, alright?

17:59.846 --> 18:02.547
If you have any problems,
you call Mrs. Ochmonek.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.649
- '..thirteen, fourteen..'
- Goodbye. Good luck.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.652
- Thanks, Bri. Love you.
- '...fifteen, sixteen..'

18:07.654 --> 18:13.458
Seventeen, eighteen
nineteen, twenty, twenty one!

18:13.460 --> 18:15.293
[camera clicks]

18:15.295 --> 18:17.028
Perfect!

18:17.030 --> 18:18.996
[instrumental music]

18:21.768 --> 18:25.436
I wonder where they are?
It's been over two hours.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.971
Well, why don't we
play another game?

18:26.973 --> 18:30.675
- How about hide and seek?
- Yeah, why not?

18:30.677 --> 18:33.277
Okay, close your eyes
and count to ten.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.113
Right.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.448
One, two

18:37.450 --> 18:39.750
three, four

18:39.752 --> 18:42.553
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.056
Okay, Brian.
Try to find me.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.858
(Brian)
'You're supposed to find me!'

18:48.528 --> 18:50.428
Well, where are you?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.497
(Brian)
'You have to look for me.'

18:52.499 --> 18:54.866
Why would I wanna do that?

18:54.868 --> 18:57.568
Haven't you ever played
hide and seek before?

18:57.570 --> 19:00.505
Yeah. There you are. I win.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.575
- We're back!
- What happened?

19:04.577 --> 19:06.577
- Where's your crown?
- The winner has it.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.247
Well, get it back from her.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.517
ALF, Lynn didn't exactly win.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.619
- Who beat you?
- Everybody.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.187
The hair, huh?

19:16.189 --> 19:18.389
ALF, I didn't lose
because of my hair.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.791
And do you know that there
were four other clog dancers

19:20.793 --> 19:23.294
including one girl
who flew in from the Ozarks?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.062
Lynn, you did your best.

19:25.064 --> 19:28.232
You should really
feel good about that.

19:28.234 --> 19:31.536
I know. I just...I just,
I really thought I had a chance.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.172
Look, the other girls just
had more experience than you.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.175
They've probably entered dozens
of these contests.

19:37.177 --> 19:41.145
I guess. You know, I just
feel bad about coming in last.

19:41.147 --> 19:45.550
Well, you know, if something
happens to those other 32 girls

19:45.552 --> 19:47.752
that crown goes to you.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.222
Thanks, dad.
I'll remember that.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.490
If you don't mind,
I'm just gonna go

19:52.492 --> 19:54.258
into my room for a while.

19:57.163 --> 20:01.032
Gee. Maybe I should go
talk to her.

20:01.034 --> 20:04.001
I was the one
who entered her in this thing.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.004
The least I could do is to try
to get rid of my guilt.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.708
[instrumental music]

20:13.680 --> 20:15.546
[doorknob rattling]

20:16.950 --> 20:19.550
It's locked, ALF. Go away.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.485
(ALF)
'How'd you know it was me?'

20:21.487 --> 20:23.221
Everyone else knocks first.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.224
[knocking on door]

20:26.226 --> 20:29.126
Alright! Alright!
I am coming, ALF.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.698
Now how did you know it was me?

20:34.901 --> 20:37.868
Look, I don't think
I wanna talk right now.

20:37.870 --> 20:41.772
You know, my Grandma Shumway
used to say that

20:41.774 --> 20:45.109
people should
talk about their problems.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.144
She was very wise.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.746
She used to go around
warning people

20:48.748 --> 20:51.682
that Melmac
was gonna blow up.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.651
And she might have escaped
the explosion too

20:53.653 --> 20:55.853
if we hadn't had her committed.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.856
Do you know I actually
got to the point

20:58.858 --> 21:00.758
where I thought I might win?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.426
Must have been nuts.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.761
You would have won

21:03.763 --> 21:06.330
if it weren't
for that crazy hairdo.

21:06.332 --> 21:08.733
It wasn't the hair.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.269
The other girls were gorgeous.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.937
What are you talking about?

21:12.939 --> 21:15.306
You were the prettiest
girl there.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.041
How do you know?

21:17.043 --> 21:20.378
Well, because you're
the prettiest girl anywhere.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.046
Come on.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.781
I mean it.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.250
Lynn, I've been everywhere.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.619
From one end of the universe
to the other.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.389
Through countless galaxies.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.224
And in all my travels

21:33.226 --> 21:36.260
I've never seen
a more beautiful girl

21:36.262 --> 21:37.762
than you.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.133
Thanks, ALF.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.169
[clears throat]

21:45.171 --> 21:46.604
Dad.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.606
Furball, Willie?

21:48.608 --> 21:49.907
Yeah.

21:49.909 --> 21:54.245
ALF...that was very nice.

21:54.247 --> 21:57.982
- Hey, it's the truth.
- I know.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.118
I was just coming in
to tell Lynn the same thing.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.486
Dad..

22:02.488 --> 22:04.655
Well, ALF's right, you know.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.357
You should have won.

22:06.359 --> 22:09.960
My clog went flying across
the stage.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.028
So what?

22:11.030 --> 22:13.731
Yeah. As long as
no one was killed.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.435
Look, I don't know
what sort of a scoring system

22:17.437 --> 22:18.703
those judges were using

22:18.705 --> 22:20.404
but I do know
they didn't judge you

22:20.406 --> 22:22.239
on any of the important things.

22:22.241 --> 22:25.976
- Like what?
- Like who you really are.

22:25.978 --> 22:29.180
A girl who's warm and caring

22:29.182 --> 22:32.750
and...who we love.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.853
So as far as I'm concerned,
you won that contest.

22:35.855 --> 22:39.056
I don't think anyone
else even came close.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.827
- Thanks, daddy.
- Yeah.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.763
This is beautiful.

22:45.765 --> 22:48.632
Don't move.
I'll go get the camera.

22:48.634 --> 22:52.536
ALF, it takes you forever
to take a picture.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.306
Don't worry.
I'll start counting now.

22:55.308 --> 22:57.475
One, two, three

22:57.477 --> 22:59.443
'four, five..'

23:01.714 --> 23:03.314
[instrumental music]

23:03.316 --> 23:05.449
- Hi, ALF!
- Hi.

23:05.451 --> 23:08.486
Hey, Kate.
Do you think I'm good-looking?

23:10.189 --> 23:11.722
Yeah, sure.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.691
Well, if you were my age

23:13.693 --> 23:16.160
would you go out with me?

23:16.162 --> 23:18.562
Well, if I were your age,
and, uh, if I weren't married

23:18.564 --> 23:23.434
and if we were
the same species...I guess so.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.870
Yeah? Where would we go?

23:25.872 --> 23:28.406
I don't know.
How-how about a "Rocky" film?

23:28.408 --> 23:30.040
Nah, he hasn't been funny

23:30.042 --> 23:32.376
since he broke up
with Bullwinkle.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.981
What else you got?

23:36.983 --> 23:38.883
That was it, ALF.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.851
You know, it doesn't sound like
you put much thought

23:40.853 --> 23:42.820
into this date.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.722
That's because I haven't.

23:44.724 --> 23:48.192
Well, fine! Why don't we just
forget the whole thing, okay?

23:49.495 --> 23:51.495
- Fine with me.
- Fine.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.232
Probably wouldn't have
worked out anyway.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.301
People would have just stared.
