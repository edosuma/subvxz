Yeah.

17:20.924 --> 17:26.094
Um, can reading feel just, like,
a little tough sometimes?

17:26.129 --> 17:28.229
A lot of tough.
Oh, yeah.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.615
You know what?
For me, too.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.566
Really?
Yeah, yeah.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.536
But I found some tricks
over the years

17:35.571 --> 17:36.570
to help make it easier.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.623
Like, look.

17:38.675 --> 17:41.626
You see the beginning of each
of the words is highlighted?

17:41.678 --> 17:44.595
That helps make sense out of
the whole word "minestrone."

17:44.631 --> 17:48.082
See, the story's about
a little girl who, um,

17:48.101 --> 17:51.719
had to read things a few times
till they made sense.

17:51.754 --> 17:53.420
And, sometimes,
some of the other kids

17:53.440 --> 17:55.256
would make fun of her.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.442
But at the end,
she figures out

17:57.477 --> 18:00.311
that it doesn't matter
how fast or slow you read.

18:00.363 --> 18:02.480
Reading's about having fun.

18:02.532 --> 18:07.101
See, my teacher gave this to me
when I was a little girl,

18:07.120 --> 18:08.903
just about your age,

18:08.938 --> 18:12.957
and I promise you,
I grew up to love reading.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.611
Ms. Schemmenti?
Yeah, hon?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.664
I still wish
we would have won.

18:19.716 --> 18:22.667
Yeah, me, too, kiddo, but,
you know, what are you gonna do?

18:22.719 --> 18:23.501
The rules are the rules.

18:23.553 --> 18:24.836
Rules stink.

18:24.888 --> 18:26.337
Yeah, they do.

18:26.389 --> 18:27.922
Go have some pizza.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.510
[ Door opens ]

18:32.562 --> 18:33.594
[ Door closes ]

18:35.148 --> 18:36.514
What happened to
your little podcast club?

18:36.566 --> 18:38.349
Oh. [ Sighs ]

18:38.401 --> 18:40.151
Kids decided they didn't want
to do it anymore.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.602
Yeah, I don't blame them.

18:41.637 --> 18:43.354
I almost fell asleep listening
to the first episode.

18:43.406 --> 18:44.355
And I was driving.

18:44.407 --> 18:46.691
Your podcast
could have killed me.

18:46.743 --> 18:49.827
I just wanted to give the kids
something new

18:49.863 --> 18:51.329
and exciting to do,
you know?

18:51.364 --> 18:53.197
New and exciting for them
or for<i> you?</i>

18:53.249 --> 18:54.481
'Cause it sounds like you
were trying to force them

18:54.501 --> 18:57.285
to do something
that you want to do.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.504
[ Mockingly ]
You're a bad teacher.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.322
Oh, my God.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.374
I've had this exact
nightmare before.

19:03.426 --> 19:04.792
Yeah, people tell me that
a lot.

19:04.827 --> 19:06.677
I call it "Ava vu."
[déjà vu]

19:06.713 --> 19:07.661
Now get out of here.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.662
There's a new episode
of "Below Deck"

19:08.681 --> 19:10.664
that I got to review
for my podcast,

19:10.683 --> 19:13.551
"Small Deck Energy."

19:13.603 --> 19:15.469
I wanted to be like
Sarah Koenig,

19:15.504 --> 19:19.640
you know, a graceful hand to
hold through gripping stories.

19:19.675 --> 19:21.642
And, instead, I tried to force
my agenda

19:21.677 --> 19:23.644
onto impressionable listeners.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.315
I Rogan'd.

19:28.785 --> 19:31.485
Melissa, I'm sorry you lost.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.021
What do you think Jacob's gonna
ask you on that podcast?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.990
Oh, I'm not doing
that crap.

19:39.629 --> 19:40.912
[ Laughs ] See that?

19:40.964 --> 19:43.714
I'm like a tall Simone Biles.
[ Exhales deeply ]

19:43.750 --> 19:46.884
Times like these, I'm reminded
of Sir LeVar Burton,

19:46.920 --> 19:50.338
who taught us that reading
is like a rainbow,

19:50.373 --> 19:53.224
and the pot of gold
is that I won.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.259
You know, Janine,
I re-read the rules

19:55.311 --> 19:57.544
that Dough Nuts prints out
on their form.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.679
Um, you know, sometimes,

19:58.714 --> 19:59.931
it takes me reading
through things

19:59.983 --> 20:02.600
a couple of times
before I get everything.

20:02.652 --> 20:04.718
"The winning teacher
is determined

20:04.737 --> 20:07.772
by whichever classroom
reads the most books."

20:07.824 --> 20:09.890
And since my
second-and-third-grade class

20:09.909 --> 20:12.777
are in one room,
the classroom,

20:12.829 --> 20:14.579
I get to add
their totals together,

20:14.614 --> 20:18.732
which, unfortunately for you,
means I won.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.834
Dough Nuts said whats?

20:27.492 --> 20:29.360
I'm glad to be back, Mr. C.
Yeah.

20:29.379 --> 20:30.912
Thanks for letting us
make it our own.

20:30.964 --> 20:35.383
For "This Abbott Life,"
here's Clarence and Raheem.

20:35.418 --> 20:38.836
So, what questions do you little
reporters have for me today?

20:38.871 --> 20:41.255
My mama said she saw you
at the club grindin'

20:41.307 --> 20:45.259
all up on
Producer Mr. Eddie.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.611
Oh, uh --
Uh --

20:46.646 --> 20:47.711
What kind of podcast
is this?

20:47.730 --> 20:49.713
Okay, so you<i> were</i> grinding.

20:49.732 --> 20:51.399
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I was not --

20:51.434 --> 20:54.685
We were dancing, you know, just
how normal people dance, right?

20:54.720 --> 20:56.387
Like normal people.
Yeah.

20:56.406 --> 20:58.555
Clarence's mom said
she saw you leave<i> together.</i>

20:58.574 --> 20:59.523
What?!
That is not true.

20:59.558 --> 21:00.858
Hmm.
Then what happened?

21:00.893 --> 21:02.910
I was outside talking
to his friend Maurice.

21:02.946 --> 21:04.445
What?

21:04.497 --> 21:07.081
Uh, Jacob, isn't this exactly
the kind of podcast

21:07.116 --> 21:09.450
you wanted
to steer away from?

21:09.502 --> 21:10.701
Actually,
I would love to hear,

21:10.736 --> 21:11.869
if you have anything
you'd like to add.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.372
You know,
for journalistic purposes.

21:16.793 --> 21:19.460
This episode was brought to you
by the Coleman Podcast Network.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.212
Yeah, we're still waiting
for that answer.
