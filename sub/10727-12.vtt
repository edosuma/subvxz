Aww,
it's the first day of school,

00:29.697 --> 00:31.330
but what's this?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.899
Pokey oaks kindergarten is
closed?

00:33.901 --> 00:36.068
What happened?
Don't you remember?

00:36.070 --> 00:39.204
For my spring break,
I fought a giant space crab

00:39.206 --> 00:41.907
on a radioactive comet
with my sisters.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.576
I found this goo
after he exploded.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.944
Oops.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.154
Oh, yeah.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.355
Hi, Pee Wee!

00:57.892 --> 00:59.191
Where are we gonna go
to school now?

00:59.193 --> 01:02.694
This new bigger, better school.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.233
We're going to prison? Sweet.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.270
No, no, no, girls.
<i>Next</i> to the prison.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.741
Wait, you mean we'll be going
to school with the...

01:15.743 --> 01:17.042
Big kids?

01:17.044 --> 01:20.412
Yep, but that's okay.
It's all part of...

01:20.414 --> 01:22.281
of...

01:22.283 --> 01:25.484
Oh, you are growing up so fast!

01:26.954 --> 01:29.188
Have a great day, kids.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.957
Don't worry, girls.
It's just a new school.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.859
I'm sure we'll fit right in.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.499
Well, this isn't too bad.

01:44.637 --> 01:46.839
This is the worst.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.707
Hey!

01:48.709 --> 01:50.676
Hi.
I'm blossom.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.145
Hey! I'm blossom!

01:53.147 --> 01:54.880
That's not what I sound like.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.748
You sound like a baby.

01:56.750 --> 02:00.385
Baby voice! Baby voice!

02:01.454 --> 02:05.023
Hey, who does your hair...
your daddy?

02:05.025 --> 02:06.825
Yes.
Yes, he does.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.561
It looks like baby hair.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.099
- Baby hair.
- Baby hair. Baby hair.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.635
What is up with your skin?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.871
It's not cool like mine.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.908
Yeesh.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.576
Baby face.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.382
We're not babies!

02:30.384 --> 02:33.852
Now, girls,
it's just the first day.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.888
Make us older.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.723
I'm sure you'll fit in
in no ti...

02:37.725 --> 02:39.024
Older!
It's too danger...

02:39.026 --> 02:41.760
Older! Older!
Older! Older!

02:41.762 --> 02:44.329
Ple-e-e-e-e-ase?

02:46.233 --> 02:49.368
Fiber, prunes,
and everything mild...

02:49.370 --> 02:51.069
these were
the ingredients chosen

02:51.071 --> 02:54.239
to make the perfect little girls
slightly older.

02:54.241 --> 02:57.142
But professor utonium
did everything correctly,

02:57.144 --> 02:58.677
and there were no accidents.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.212
The whole thing went smoothly.

03:00.214 --> 03:03.081
Pretty anticlimactic,
if you ask me.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.385
Now, girls, only one teaspoon
for each of you.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.788
Otherwise, the ramifications
of this could be dangerous.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.456
We know!

03:11.458 --> 03:12.658
Good night, girls.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.126
Good night, professor!

03:17.530 --> 03:19.431
Do you think it's working?

03:19.433 --> 03:21.633
Maybe we need to wait a little.

03:21.635 --> 03:22.968
Waiting is for babies!

03:22.970 --> 03:25.070
We need more
of that magic juice.

03:25.072 --> 03:28.006
Dun, dun, dun, dun-dun!

03:28.008 --> 03:29.841
We are sneaking.
Bubbles!

03:29.843 --> 03:31.443
Sorry!

03:32.845 --> 03:34.780
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.815
Maybe we could try talking
to the other kids in...

03:39.453 --> 03:41.753
Or we just drink the formula
and see what happens.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.022
Cheers!

03:51.565 --> 03:53.465
Aaaaah!

03:53.467 --> 03:54.766
I'm old!

03:55.970 --> 03:58.370
We're all old!

03:58.372 --> 04:01.173
Maybe the professor
won't notice.

04:01.175 --> 04:04.509
Of course I noticed.
And I'm very disappointed.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.912
<i>You're</i> disappointed?

04:06.914 --> 04:09.581
My teeth won't even stay in!

04:09.583 --> 04:10.749
What?!

04:10.751 --> 04:13.118
Speak up!
I can't hear you!

04:14.521 --> 04:15.787
Who are you people?

04:17.156 --> 04:20.459
Professor, you got
to make us young again.

04:20.461 --> 04:23.362
I'll work on an antidote
while you're at school.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.596
School?!

04:24.598 --> 04:26.898
You don't want to ruin
your perfect attendance

04:26.900 --> 04:28.367
on the second day.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.872
Well, now that we're old,
at least we'll get some respect.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.012
I take it back.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.881
<i>This</i> is officially the worst.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.352
Whatcha knitting...

04:47.354 --> 04:49.855
booties for your grandkids?

04:51.258 --> 04:55.994
No, it's a caboodle
for your noodle, my child.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.030
Totes sweet!

04:58.032 --> 04:59.665
Us next!

05:01.135 --> 05:03.335
Give us your lunch money,
old lady!

05:03.337 --> 05:07.606
I don't have any money,
but I have some hard candy.

05:07.608 --> 05:11.009
We don't want
hard candy, grandma!

05:11.011 --> 05:13.245
I understand.

05:13.247 --> 05:16.114
This candy is probably
too hard for you anyways.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.616
What are you saying?

05:17.618 --> 05:21.320
"Big" Joey here can't handle
your little bit of candy?

05:23.257 --> 05:26.825
Hey, this ain't
totally terrible.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.959
Can we have some more?

05:27.961 --> 05:29.795
Us, too!

05:29.797 --> 05:31.129
And that is

05:31.131 --> 05:34.099
how Christopher Columbus
discovered America.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.701
Boring...

05:35.703 --> 05:39.638
Christopher Columbus
didn't discover America!

05:39.640 --> 05:41.640
It was the vikings.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.841
I should know.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.743
I was on leif eriksson's boat.

05:46.313 --> 05:50.916
So, that's how we defeated
Dracula and the shark people

05:50.918 --> 05:53.885
and discovered salt lake city!

05:55.756 --> 05:59.725
Hmm, I think I may have
figured out the antidote.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.429
Or maybe not.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.133
Thank you for the hat!

06:08.135 --> 06:10.001
Thank you for the hard candy.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.104
Great stories, granny buttercup.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.305
All right.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.006
Tomorrow, I'll tell you

06:15.008 --> 06:17.976
about the battle
with the plutonians.

06:19.947 --> 06:23.115
Darn these dentures!

06:23.117 --> 06:25.350
Here, grandma buttercup.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.586
I also got you
some denture cream...

06:27.588 --> 06:29.821
same as my Nana.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.156
Stronger than mega glue.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.358
Mm-hmm!

06:34.227 --> 06:35.861
Thanks, sport!

06:35.863 --> 06:40.365
Who knew being super-old would
get us so much street cred?

06:40.367 --> 06:42.467
Still, what I wouldn't give

06:42.469 --> 06:45.804
to have one more stab
at youth again.

06:47.341 --> 06:50.242
Nothing, mom.
Just walking the dog.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.911
Or should I say
he is walking Mojo.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.748
- What's that?
- Hm?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.751
Uh, yeah, of course, I'm getting
you a birthday present.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.052
Hmm?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.788
Powerpuff girls!

07:02.790 --> 07:04.322
Mojo!

07:04.324 --> 07:07.192
You are wrinkly old ladies!

07:07.194 --> 07:10.162
Are you sure that's Mojo?

07:10.164 --> 07:12.297
Looks like a cactus
or something.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.665
Yes, it is Mojo!

07:13.667 --> 07:16.067
The hat, the evil laugh...
ha, ha, ha!...

07:16.069 --> 07:18.069
the winning smile.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.337
Oh, hi, Mojo.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.640
You're so old and wrinkly,

07:21.642 --> 07:25.343
you will never again interfere
with my genius master plans!

07:28.615 --> 07:30.449
We might be old,

07:30.451 --> 07:33.218
but we still got pep
in our step!

07:33.220 --> 07:34.953
Come on, girls!

07:34.955 --> 07:36.321
Let's get him!

07:49.469 --> 07:51.069
Mojo grows tired of this.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.404
He would love to stay,

07:52.406 --> 07:55.207
but he has important crimes
to commit...

07:55.209 --> 07:56.942
And personal errands to run.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.511
You stay here, buddy,
and watch those grannies...

07:59.513 --> 08:02.047
...until I return...
with money and stuff.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.324
Hmm...

08:17.697 --> 08:19.397
♪ Miss Suzy had
a steamboat ♪

08:19.399 --> 08:21.132
♪ The steamboat had
a bell, ding, ding ♪

08:24.471 --> 08:26.371
Mom, you like rubies, right?

08:26.373 --> 08:27.606
They match your eyes...

08:27.608 --> 08:30.242
Your red, red eyes.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.779
We have to stop Mojo!

08:34.780 --> 08:36.047
What?

08:36.049 --> 08:38.015
Let's just fly.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.284
Oof!

08:40.287 --> 08:42.354
Being old stinks!

08:44.224 --> 08:46.791
Okay, mom, I have to go.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.059
But, mom!

08:48.061 --> 08:49.928
I am in the middle
of a crime spree

08:49.930 --> 08:51.162
for your birthday!

08:51.164 --> 08:52.731
Okay.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.634
- I love you, too.
- Mwah!

08:55.636 --> 08:58.370
Now it's time to get
a little present for myself...

08:58.372 --> 09:01.706
the annihilation
of the Powerpuff girls!

09:06.747 --> 09:08.113
Aah!

09:08.115 --> 09:09.447
Mojo!

09:09.449 --> 09:11.516
What are we gonna do?

09:11.518 --> 09:15.253
We're just old bags
of wrinkles and bones.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.223
Listen, ladies, did we give up

09:18.225 --> 09:20.492
when fuzzy lumpkins kidnapped
the mayor

09:20.494 --> 09:22.127
and turned him into cheese?

09:22.129 --> 09:23.628
Huh?
No!

09:23.630 --> 09:27.299
Did we give up when
Princess morbucks attacked us

09:27.301 --> 09:29.434
with an army of robot goats?

09:29.436 --> 09:31.503
No!
Did we give up

09:31.505 --> 09:34.205
on the Teddy bear
in the claw machine,

09:34.207 --> 09:37.175
even after bubbles' hand
got stuck in it?

09:37.177 --> 09:38.410
No!

09:38.412 --> 09:40.378
Are you with me?!

09:40.380 --> 09:41.546
Yeah!

09:41.548 --> 09:43.682
Okay.
Let's do this.

09:46.620 --> 09:50.822
Get ready for the sweet taste
of justice.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.761
Things are about to get sticky!

09:58.030 --> 09:59.331
Aah!

09:59.333 --> 10:01.399
Time to wrap this up.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.444
You can't stop me
with your silly old-lady tricks!

10:12.446 --> 10:14.679
I am Mojo Jo...

10:14.681 --> 10:16.915
Hey, are you picking
on our grannies?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.483
Uh-oh.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.652
Now, that's what I call

10:20.654 --> 10:22.120
an old-fashioned whupping.

10:23.357 --> 10:25.924
Hey, girls,
I've got the antidote.

10:27.259 --> 10:30.795
Wow, those kids
really respected us.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.831
I think I'm gonna miss
being old.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.099
Me, too.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.402
And I think I speak
for all of us when I say...

10:38.672 --> 10:41.406
'Scuse me, ladies.

10:42.074 --> 10:43.208
Cheers.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.146
We're really sorry, professor.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.915
We shouldn't have been
in such a rush to grow up.

10:50.917 --> 10:54.586
Oh, girls,
I never want you to grow up.

10:54.588 --> 10:58.790
Mm.
This is nice.
