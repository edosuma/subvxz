Excuse me. Hi.

01:59.921 --> 02:02.489
- Hi.
- Um, may I have a cigarette?

02:02.523 --> 02:05.158
Uh, you wanna bum a smoke?

02:05.192 --> 02:06.928
- Sure.
- Yeah, for sure.

02:06.961 --> 02:07.494
-There you go.
-Thank you.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.495
Enjoy.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.864
You know, those things
will kill you, right?

02:13.433 --> 02:14.769
Actually, can I have two more?

02:16.504 --> 02:18.806
Yeah, sure.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.608
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Thanks.

02:20.642 --> 02:21.609
All right.

02:21.643 --> 02:23.911
Oh, and matches. Do you have...

02:23.945 --> 02:25.412
- Matches?
- Matches or--

02:25.445 --> 02:26.614
You want cocaine also?

02:28.248 --> 02:29.617
-No, I just--
-I'll give you a lighter.

02:29.651 --> 02:31.218
I got a lighter--

02:31.251 --> 02:32.687
-Okay.
-Somewhere in here. Hold up.

02:34.722 --> 02:35.923
Oh, where the heck is it?

03:01.749 --> 03:02.850
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

03:02.884 --> 03:04.919

03:04.952 --> 03:06.087
<i>do not disturb,</i>

03:06.120 --> 03:09.557

<i>that this mornin'--</i>

03:13.326 --> 03:15.630
<i>I learned how to slap the bass!</i>

03:15.663 --> 03:17.364
<i>Pretty cool, right?</i>

03:17.397 --> 03:19.232
<i>Give me a call if you want.</i>

03:19.266 --> 03:21.268
<i>All right. Love you. Bye.</i>

03:25.372 --> 03:28.776

04:04.879 --> 04:07.815
<i>No more phone calls, for reals.</i>

04:07.849 --> 04:08.850
<i>Bye.</i>

04:44.952 --> 04:45.920
Hmm.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.600
That looks nice.

04:59.634 --> 05:00.535
What are you doing?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.590
Just start unloading, I guess,
yeah?

05:22.623 --> 05:23.591
Okay. Thanks, guys.

05:25.960 --> 05:29.597
Uh, yeah. Oh! Hey!

05:29.630 --> 05:31.065
I'm Sandra, the party planner.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.701
Did you want us to set up
in front or around back?

05:35.503 --> 05:37.004
Am I stupid?

05:37.038 --> 05:38.539
I'm sorry.

05:38.573 --> 05:40.508
No, I'm sorry, I--
I thought I cancelled this.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.777
The-- the party's cancelled.

05:42.810 --> 05:46.814
Oh! No, I don't think so.

05:46.848 --> 05:48.516
No, no, I'm--
I'm cancelling it now.

05:50.051 --> 05:51.652
No, you can't do that.

05:51.686 --> 05:54.454
You are-- you're way past
the 24-hour cancellation period,

05:54.487 --> 05:55.690
so...

05:55.723 --> 05:58.425
Okay, well, I don't want it,
so take it back.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.460
Uh, uh, I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.929
There's nothing you can do?

06:01.963 --> 06:04.565
All you have to do
is not do anything.

06:04.599 --> 06:05.867
That's how
you don't have a party.

06:07.034 --> 06:10.605
Okay, legally,
because you missed

06:10.638 --> 06:13.406
the 24-hour
cancellation deadline,

06:13.440 --> 06:14.976
I have to set up a party.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.678
I legally have to have a party?

06:18.980 --> 06:22.083
Uh, I-- I guess I could try
to do something.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.050
- Uh, yeah.
- I guess you could.

06:23.084 --> 06:24.619
- That'd be nice. Thank you.
- So...

06:24.652 --> 06:25.653
What I need to do is

06:25.686 --> 06:27.889
talk to the person
who authorized the payment,

06:27.922 --> 06:31.559
and that would be
Jennifer Martinez.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.860
Okay. Yeah, great.

06:32.894 --> 06:34.028
- Let me get her.
- Okay.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.496
Jennifer! Jennifer!

06:38.498 --> 06:39.432
Jen!

06:40.701 --> 06:42.169
Oh, that's right. She's dead.

06:44.639 --> 06:47.174
- Shit.
- Yeah.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.744
I'm sure you could reach her
if you have a medium

06:49.777 --> 06:51.078
or a shovel.

06:51.112 --> 06:53.214
So, sh-- she was your, um...

06:53.247 --> 06:55.983
We were best friends
and business partners.

06:56.017 --> 06:58.686
We made an organic soda
and we just

06:58.719 --> 07:01.454
-got a distribution deal
to be in stores.
-Oh, that's big!

07:01.488 --> 07:02.990
Yeah, I know, Sandra,
it's very big.

07:03.024 --> 07:04.225
- It's huge.
- Mmhmm.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.928
That's why we rented this place
originally.

07:06.961 --> 07:09.063
That's why we were
gonna throw a party originally.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.666
But none of that matters now,
because she's gone.

07:12.934 --> 07:16.537
So, could you please
just cancel the party?

07:20.608 --> 07:21.609
What are you doing?

07:26.213 --> 07:30.651
No, because you missed
the cancellation deadline.

07:30.685 --> 07:31.585
Okay, got it.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.988
You know what?

07:34.021 --> 07:37.925
I'll-- I'll bet it'd be fun if
you threw yourself a party, huh?

07:37.959 --> 07:42.096
I bet your friend would--
would have liked that.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.834
Would you like a Xanax?

07:46.867 --> 07:47.935
- No. What?
- Okay.

07:47.969 --> 07:50.237
Okay, yeah, all right,
I'll take one.

07:50.271 --> 07:51.939
What if I take half?

07:51.973 --> 07:54.141
Just--
no, you need the whole one.

07:54.175 --> 07:56.010
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.047
Okay. Yeah, Sandra here.

08:00.081 --> 08:00.915
Just keep setting it up.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.150
Yeah,
it's gonna be a party for one.

08:03.184 --> 08:04.685
Yeah, but we're gonna
just download the...

08:04.719 --> 08:07.254
Hi, I'm supposed to tell you
that the uh,

08:07.288 --> 08:10.224
the trays marked with an M
are for meat, they have meat,

08:10.257 --> 08:12.626
and then the ones marked
with a V have veggie.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.928
Did you get veggie or is that--

08:13.961 --> 08:15.763
I don't fuckin' know.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.064
Just put it in the house.

08:17.098 --> 08:18.099
Okay.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.218
Stupid fuckin' sunset.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.129

09:32.807 --> 09:33.908
Okay.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.113
No.

13:23.571 --> 13:24.471
Yeah. Thanks, Jen.

Jesus!

14:16.658 --> 14:17.592
Pancakes.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.162
No.

14:25.032 --> 14:25.966
What...

14:28.335 --> 14:30.938
I know this is an odd encounter.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.641
My appearance resembles
your perished companion.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.612
Unfortunately,
Jennifer continues

14:37.645 --> 14:40.582
and will continue
to remain deceased.

14:40.615 --> 14:43.551
I am simply an extraterrestrial
who has taken her form.

14:55.597 --> 14:58.399
Now that you have had ample time
to comprehend what I have said,

15:00.300 --> 15:01.569
please stop leaving!

15:04.506 --> 15:05.673

<i>what's goin' on?</i>

15:07.374 --> 15:08.208
<i>Are you okay? Are you hurt?</i>

15:08.242 --> 15:09.611
No, I just-- I was, um...

15:11.579 --> 15:14.248
I don't know,
I was inside and then...

15:14.281 --> 15:15.382
I don't know.

15:15.416 --> 15:17.484
I'm--
I feel like I'm going crazy.

15:17.519 --> 15:20.187
<i>Babe,</i>
<i>your best friend passed away.</i>

15:20.220 --> 15:21.321
<i>It's gonna take time.</i>

15:21.355 --> 15:23.725
<i>You're-- you're processing.</i>

15:23.758 --> 15:26.528
I'm processing.

15:26.561 --> 15:28.128
<i>Yes. Yeah, yeah!</i>

15:28.162 --> 15:29.597
<i>You're-- you're--</i>
<i>you're havin' a moment!</i>

15:29.631 --> 15:32.366
Yeah, I was having a moment.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.967
<i>Exactly!</i>

15:34.001 --> 15:36.036
I just don't wanna totally
lose it out here, Eric.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.237
<i>Come on.</i>

15:37.271 --> 15:40.073
<i>Come on, Vanessa,</i>
<i>you're not gonna lose it!</i>

15:40.107 --> 15:42.976
<i>You're like a freak of nature.</i>

15:43.010 --> 15:45.513
Like a total freakin' freak
of nature.

15:45.547 --> 15:49.149
Okay, I feel um, better.

15:49.183 --> 15:51.118
I'm-- I'm breathing at least.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.286
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

15:52.319 --> 15:56.056
<i>You know, maybe go outside,</i>
<i>take a hike,</i>

15:56.089 --> 15:57.391
<i>get some fresh air.</i>

15:57.424 --> 15:58.626
<i>That might be nice.</i>

15:58.660 --> 16:00.394
Okay. Thank you.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.731
Don't come out here, I'm fine.

16:03.765 --> 16:06.333
<i>Nope, wasn't thinkin'</i>
<i>about comin' out there.</i>

16:06.366 --> 16:08.368
<i>I was thinkin'</i>
<i>about goin' halfway, though.</i>

16:08.402 --> 16:10.037
Eric, I'm-- I'm fine.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.438
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

16:11.472 --> 16:14.041
<i>But maybe I just</i>
<i>look at hotel prices</i>

16:14.074 --> 16:14.742
<i>just in case.</i>

16:14.776 --> 16:16.443
Honey, stop.

16:16.477 --> 16:19.514
<i>Okay, okay. I-- I love you.</i>

16:19.547 --> 16:20.481
I love you.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.318
<i>Bye.</i>

17:08.462 --> 17:09.496
What were you gonna do?

17:09.531 --> 17:10.497
Key your friend?

17:33.821 --> 17:34.722
You've returned.

17:34.756 --> 17:35.823
Shall we proceed?

17:37.559 --> 17:40.093
No, no, no, no.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.529
I don't wanna go crazy.

17:46.701 --> 17:49.436
I can assure you
my appearance is not a result

17:49.469 --> 17:50.805
of you going crazy.

17:51.873 --> 17:52.807
Okay.

18:02.617 --> 18:05.152
You are watching
your dead best friend

18:05.185 --> 18:06.353
chug olive oil.

18:10.457 --> 18:13.226
This galaxy sun
damages my structure.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.564
We have discovered that oil
provides protective lubrication.

18:16.598 --> 18:18.332
Margarita?

18:18.365 --> 18:19.834
No!

18:19.867 --> 18:22.804
No, I don't want a margarita.

18:22.837 --> 18:24.304
I wanna know what's happening.

18:25.540 --> 18:27.374
Then shall we begin orientation?

18:29.276 --> 18:30.645
What?

18:30.678 --> 18:31.646
Shall we?

18:33.915 --> 18:35.115
Oh, you want me to sit?

18:37.785 --> 18:38.720
Shall we?

18:39.921 --> 18:41.254
Are you just
gonna keep saying "shall we"

18:41.288 --> 18:42.456
until I sit down?

18:43.591 --> 18:45.158
-Shall we?
-Okay, okay.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.234
Hello.

18:58.372 --> 18:59.272
Hi.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.586
Oh. Okay.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.690
I am
a species observation officer.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.594
Is that supposed to be me?

19:19.627 --> 19:21.562
Yes, and that is me.

19:21.596 --> 19:22.730
On this maiden voyage,

19:22.764 --> 19:24.666
our mission is
to study human subjects,

19:24.699 --> 19:26.534
so that we may have
a full comprehension

19:26.567 --> 19:27.735
of your species.

19:29.871 --> 19:31.204
Why? To kill us?

19:33.306 --> 19:35.409
We have not discovered a benefit
to your destruction.

19:36.944 --> 19:39.914
We will focus on your physical
and cognitive abilities,

19:39.947 --> 19:43.417
as well as other behaviors
and emotive response.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.619
It is similar

19:44.652 --> 19:46.788
to how your species
studies other species.

19:46.821 --> 19:49.991
After 48 hours, I will depart
without having harmed you

19:50.024 --> 19:51.559
in any way.

19:51.592 --> 19:52.527
That's nice.

19:58.666 --> 20:01.869
So, I shouldn't have taken
that Xanax

20:01.903 --> 20:03.771
with a bottle of champagne.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.941
And I probably choked
on my own vomit.

20:08.509 --> 20:12.013
And I died on this lounge chair,
which is why I'm back.

20:12.046 --> 20:13.014
Okay.

20:13.047 --> 20:15.583
No, incorrect narrative.

20:15.616 --> 20:16.584
Okey dokey.

20:18.485 --> 20:19.887
You must have inquiries.

20:19.921 --> 20:21.923
No, I-- I think I'm gonna go.

20:23.057 --> 20:24.324
Where will you go?

20:24.357 --> 20:25.660
To the hospital.

20:27.762 --> 20:30.430
No, I just charged,
this was at 30%.

20:31.733 --> 20:33.868
That is because of
your device's proximity to me.

20:34.902 --> 20:35.837
My planet is made up

20:35.870 --> 20:38.539
of what you would call
"lightning storms",

20:38.573 --> 20:40.373
which we have adapted to.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.745
Thus, we absorb the battery life
of anything around us

20:43.778 --> 20:45.780
with a battery life.

20:48.816 --> 20:49.984
And we can conduct heat.

20:50.017 --> 20:50.785
Observe.

20:55.823 --> 20:58.860
Okay. It's part of the process.

20:58.893 --> 21:02.496
Just you miss your best friend
who died,

21:02.530 --> 21:06.500
so you conjured up
this fucked up-- no offence,

21:06.534 --> 21:08.368
alien version of her.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.771
Inaccurate.

21:09.804 --> 21:13.574
If I'm truly hallucinating,
then this won't hurt.

21:13.608 --> 21:16.309
-Injury imminent.
-Ow! Mm, ow!

21:16.343 --> 21:18.846
That-- okay, that's real.

21:18.880 --> 21:22.315
That is very real,
which means

21:22.349 --> 21:24.986
I must have blacked out,
started the fire,

21:25.019 --> 21:27.688
and then blacked back in.

21:27.722 --> 21:28.923
Blacked back in.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.490
I don't know. Let me think.

21:39.634 --> 21:40.701
What are you doing?

21:40.735 --> 21:42.036
These hair pouches torment me.

21:43.805 --> 21:45.372
They are always there
when I look up.

21:47.642 --> 21:49.010
Have you ceased thinking?

21:49.043 --> 21:50.410
Do you consent to testing?

21:52.113 --> 21:53.446
It's my choice?

21:53.480 --> 21:54.682
Yes, you have control.

21:57.552 --> 21:59.654
Yes. Yes, I do.

21:59.687 --> 22:03.024
It is in my control,
because I am a strong,

22:03.057 --> 22:05.059
powerful woman.

22:05.092 --> 22:07.394
A freak of nature,
some have said.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.096
And I am perfectly capable

22:09.130 --> 22:11.032
of taking charge
of my own mental breakdown.

22:13.601 --> 22:14.969
It's my decision.

22:15.002 --> 22:17.805
So, my decision next will be
to have this margarita.

22:17.839 --> 22:18.773
Cheers.

22:21.576 --> 22:22.944
I would also like to--
oh, that's delicious.

22:24.745 --> 22:26.113
Wait, how do you know

22:26.147 --> 22:29.150
I like pomegranate
and jalapenos?

22:29.183 --> 22:31.919
I have
all of Jennifer's memories.

22:31.953 --> 22:34.454
In exchange
for your participation,

22:34.487 --> 22:38.025
you receive two days
with your dead best friend.

22:38.059 --> 22:39.694
Why did you not lead with that?

22:40.895 --> 22:42.563
My brain.

22:42.597 --> 22:43.598
I will make a note.

22:44.966 --> 22:47.935
For future visits,
lead with memories.

22:47.969 --> 22:50.071
So I can just ask you
anything I want?

22:50.104 --> 22:50.938
You may.

22:53.708 --> 22:55.109
This is good. I like that.

22:56.944 --> 22:58.546
Okay. I'm gonna test you.

23:01.215 --> 23:02.917
What is
Jennifer's favorite color?

23:02.950 --> 23:03.751
Wait, that's a stupid question.

23:03.784 --> 23:05.152
Hot pink.

23:05.186 --> 23:06.721
I mean, of course,
you get the clue from the hair.

23:08.623 --> 23:10.490
In college, I had a pet lizard.

23:10.524 --> 23:13.561
I went away for the weekend
and Jennifer told me

23:13.594 --> 23:14.729
that he died of natural causes.

23:14.762 --> 23:15.630
Is that true?

23:15.663 --> 23:16.964
No.

23:16.998 --> 23:19.800
Jennifer accidentally impaled it
with a high heel.

23:19.834 --> 23:20.768
Franklin.

23:22.803 --> 23:24.538
I mean I have no way of knowing
if any of this is real.

23:25.973 --> 23:29.476
Okay, this is something
I only told Jennifer.

23:29.510 --> 23:32.780
In second grade, I told everyone
that I kissed Tyler,

23:32.813 --> 23:34.015
but the real person

23:34.048 --> 23:35.816
that I kissed
behind the dumpster was--

23:35.850 --> 23:37.450
Cody who smells grody.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.519
Dammit.

23:41.022 --> 23:43.490
Whatever. Fine. I guess I'm in.

23:44.759 --> 23:46.994
It might be fun to see
how unstable I can get.

23:47.028 --> 23:48.629
If this is
what you find to be fun,

23:48.663 --> 23:50.031
then I do hope we achieve it!

23:54.201 --> 23:57.505
So, if you are really an alien,

23:57.538 --> 23:59.206
why was I chosen
as the human subject?

24:00.641 --> 24:02.777
Species observation officers

24:02.810 --> 24:05.680
do not have jurisdiction
over who their subject is.

24:05.713 --> 24:06.814
I was assigned to you.

24:10.685 --> 24:11.719
Oh, sorry.

24:12.853 --> 24:13.988
That is Jennifer's ring?

24:15.056 --> 24:15.990
Yeah.

24:18.125 --> 24:21.595
Jennifer uh, got us these
for my 8th birthday.

24:22.830 --> 24:24.832
I asked all the girls
in our class

24:24.865 --> 24:26.267
to come over
for a slumber party,

24:26.300 --> 24:28.169
but Jennifer was the only one
who showed up.

24:30.571 --> 24:32.239
My mom went hard
for the theme, too.

24:32.273 --> 24:34.241
It was out of this world,

24:36.744 --> 24:39.046
which is why
I am imagining this.

24:40.614 --> 24:43.050
Jennifer mixed syrupy soda
with fizzy candy

24:43.084 --> 24:44.986
and experienced
excessive regurgitation

24:45.019 --> 24:46.821
that night.

24:46.854 --> 24:49.724
Yeah, she--
she puked really hard.

24:51.892 --> 24:54.729
It was probably
more of a positive memory

24:54.762 --> 24:55.796
for me than her.

24:58.666 --> 25:01.135
Jennifer wrote in her diary,
"Best night ever".

25:03.771 --> 25:05.306
Test complete next.

25:05.339 --> 25:08.776
Fifth grade,
we rode our bikes downtown,

25:08.809 --> 25:10.644
got lost, had to call my parents
to pick us up.

25:11.846 --> 25:13.080
And I was grounded for a month.

25:14.215 --> 25:16.150
Tell me which letter you see.

25:16.183 --> 25:18.019
I mean are we--
this is how we're starting?

25:18.052 --> 25:20.121
Tell me what letter you see.

25:20.154 --> 25:21.689
Q.

25:21.722 --> 25:23.691
- And now?
- E.

25:25.993 --> 25:28.162
Jennifer's favorite movie
was Fight Club.

25:29.330 --> 25:31.165
I don't know
where this one's coming from.

25:31.198 --> 25:32.767
Oh, summer boot camp!

25:32.800 --> 25:34.135
We quit June 1st.

25:42.977 --> 25:46.347
Subject bladder evacuation speed
below average.

25:46.380 --> 25:47.882
Well, just give me a second.

25:47.915 --> 25:49.116
I can get one more second out.

25:54.388 --> 25:55.956
Dammit.

25:55.990 --> 25:58.893
Okay, am I following you,
'cause I'm not doing that.

26:01.362 --> 26:02.563
What are you doing?

26:03.998 --> 26:06.967
Now, I will be performing
an audiometry evaluation.

26:07.001 --> 26:07.835
Please turn around.

26:10.104 --> 26:12.339
Identify where the sound
is coming from.

26:14.308 --> 26:15.976
I don't hear any-- left.

26:16.010 --> 26:17.311
Right.

26:17.344 --> 26:18.612
Right again.

26:18.646 --> 26:20.047
Both sides now.

26:20.081 --> 26:23.284
Adult female hearing, average.

26:23.317 --> 26:27.188
What? I was just being playful.

26:27.221 --> 26:30.991
Adult female being playful.

26:31.025 --> 26:33.160
Okay, what's next?

26:33.194 --> 26:35.930
Oh!

26:35.963 --> 26:37.932
Aquatic Agility Assessment.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.701
What are you doing?

26:40.734 --> 26:42.069
I am being playful.

26:45.673 --> 26:47.341
Are you trying to s-- smile?

26:47.374 --> 26:48.709
Am I succeeding?

26:50.344 --> 26:51.912
No. No.

26:56.117 --> 26:59.120
-All right, so--
-Like don't suck your bottom lip
under your whole mouth.

27:02.756 --> 27:04.391
What are we doing?

27:04.425 --> 27:05.594
What are we doing right now?

27:05.626 --> 27:09.263
-Aquatic agility analysis.
-Then, let's start. Let's start.

27:16.303 --> 27:17.905
45 seconds.

27:17.938 --> 27:18.772
Nice.

27:20.207 --> 27:23.277
Lung capacity of human female
minimally above average.

27:23.310 --> 27:24.912
Oh.

27:24.945 --> 27:26.247
And don't you forget it.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.882
No, please do not touch this.

27:27.915 --> 27:28.883
Oh, sorry.

27:28.916 --> 27:31.185
I didn't mean
to touch your recorder thingy.

27:32.386 --> 27:33.254
Why are you still here,
by the way?

27:33.287 --> 27:34.989
Shouldn't you have disappeared
by now?

27:36.190 --> 27:38.659
I am not sure how you have come
to this conclusion.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.328
I said my goodbyes to Jennifer.

27:41.362 --> 27:42.863
I mourned her.

27:42.897 --> 27:45.900
I mean I'm-- I'm good unless--

27:45.933 --> 27:48.435
Oh, is there something
that she needs to tell me

27:48.469 --> 27:50.237
before she can cross over?

27:50.271 --> 27:51.071
Oh!

27:51.105 --> 27:54.041
No, I am afraid
oxygen deprivation

27:54.074 --> 27:55.142
has confused you.

27:55.176 --> 27:57.077
I am not a ghost.

27:57.111 --> 27:59.213
Shall we do orientation
once more?

27:59.246 --> 28:00.047
No, no. No, no, no.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.081
We're good. We're good.

28:01.115 --> 28:01.949
You're not a ghost. Noted.

28:03.150 --> 28:04.952
You wanna see me do
a cannonball?

28:04.985 --> 28:07.922
Like Jennifer did at the end
of every swim meet?

28:07.955 --> 28:11.992
Yes, which is exactly why I am
hallucinating this scenario.

28:13.427 --> 28:16.063
Your dad came to every meet.

28:16.096 --> 28:17.164
Yeah.

28:17.198 --> 28:18.199
God, he was so embarrassing.

28:19.934 --> 28:22.736
Jennifer's dad never came
to a swim meet.

28:22.770 --> 28:24.972
He did not even know
she was on the team.

28:25.005 --> 28:26.006
He knew.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.309
He just uh, didn't care.

28:30.110 --> 28:31.011
Same for the funeral.

28:33.047 --> 28:34.048
All right, time this one.

28:58.138 --> 28:59.840
Do you eat?

29:01.175 --> 29:02.876
It is not necessary
for survival,

29:02.910 --> 29:05.212
but I am capable of doing so.

29:05.246 --> 29:07.081
On my planet,
we receive sustenance

29:07.114 --> 29:09.783
via injection of vitamins.

29:09.817 --> 29:11.519
The human body
is gravely inefficient

29:11.553 --> 29:13.187
at processing nutrients.

29:14.922 --> 29:16.957
It's not
about processing nutrients.

29:18.058 --> 29:20.060
I really like cooking.

29:20.094 --> 29:21.262
Something about it calms me.

29:21.295 --> 29:23.531
It's the predictability
or something.

29:23.565 --> 29:27.301
You mix flour with sugar,
you're gonna make cookies.

29:28.869 --> 29:30.871
Well, there's other steps
in between, but you get it.

29:32.473 --> 29:34.208
Your soda recipe was a mistake.

29:35.376 --> 29:36.277
Not my mistake.

29:37.545 --> 29:39.280
Jennifer?

29:39.313 --> 29:39.847
Yeah.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.915
Uh, it was a decent soda

29:41.949 --> 29:45.853
before Jennifer accidentally
put way too much ginger in it,

29:45.886 --> 29:49.456
and then it was just um,
too good to deny.

29:51.559 --> 29:52.560
That's Jennifer.

29:56.564 --> 29:58.198
Hmm. Oh.

30:05.005 --> 30:06.140
You just put the whole thing in?

30:08.375 --> 30:10.377
How's it going? Eating food?

30:12.913 --> 30:15.482
Jennifer's memories indicate
you were a chef,

30:15.517 --> 30:19.353
but the flavors and textures
of that small sandwich

30:20.487 --> 30:24.124
are causing positive explosions
of saliva in my mouth!

30:25.560 --> 30:26.594
That's-- that's good.

30:28.596 --> 30:32.366
Human sense memory inferior
to present experience.

30:33.668 --> 30:34.602
Thank you.

30:41.108 --> 30:43.077
Shall we continue?

30:44.512 --> 30:46.013
What is that cracking sound?

30:46.046 --> 30:47.314
I'm 36.

30:48.415 --> 30:50.317
Elevate your arms.

30:50.351 --> 30:52.453
Move your head
on a vertical axis.

30:52.486 --> 30:53.822
What is-- oh, nod?

30:56.423 --> 30:58.992
♪ Cut my life into pieces ♪

30:59.026 --> 31:00.928
♪ This is my last resort ♪

31:00.961 --> 31:03.531
Yes, that's where this is from.

31:03.565 --> 31:06.534
Papa Roach, middle School.

31:06.568 --> 31:07.535
We were obsessed with them.

31:09.169 --> 31:11.506
When we finally saw them
in concert,

31:11.539 --> 31:13.907
oh, Jennifer pulled me
into the mosh pit,

31:13.941 --> 31:16.443
and I immediately
got a black eye.

31:16.477 --> 31:19.246
Oh, my mom was pissed,
but it was amazing.

31:21.115 --> 31:22.249
Breathe.

31:24.118 --> 31:26.253
-Jennifer enjoyed that evening
also.
-Yeah.

31:27.187 --> 31:29.923
I mean that was
our first time seeing them,

31:29.957 --> 31:31.158
so we talked about it
for months.

31:33.193 --> 31:34.629
It was not
Jennifer's first time.

31:36.631 --> 31:37.565
What?

31:39.166 --> 31:42.202
She saw them the year before
with her sister.

31:42.236 --> 31:44.304
No, she-- no, she didn't.

31:44.338 --> 31:45.272
She did.

31:46.340 --> 31:47.374
No, she, uh...

31:48.610 --> 31:49.544
She would have told me.

31:51.245 --> 31:52.212
She never told you.

31:53.380 --> 31:54.481
Why wouldn't she tell me?

31:54.516 --> 31:55.949
She wouldn't lie to me.

31:55.983 --> 31:57.619
Her memories indicate
she lied to you,

31:57.652 --> 31:59.153
because she felt
telling you the truth

31:59.186 --> 32:00.087
would hurt you.

32:09.163 --> 32:10.532
No, please do not leave again.

32:10.565 --> 32:13.033
No, I just-- I have to pee again

32:13.066 --> 32:14.569
and you already
have that research,

32:14.602 --> 32:15.737
so just stay here.

32:19.641 --> 32:21.041
<i>Vanessa?</i>

32:21.074 --> 32:23.110
Hey, Megan.

32:23.143 --> 32:24.378
<i>How are you doing?</i>

32:24.411 --> 32:26.614
You know, going crazy.

32:26.648 --> 32:28.516
<i>Yeah, us too.</i>

32:28.550 --> 32:30.618
Hey, tell your mom I said "hi".

32:30.652 --> 32:31.786
<i>I will.</i>

32:31.820 --> 32:35.022
I was actually calling you
to ask you something weird.

32:36.423 --> 32:37.525
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

32:39.159 --> 32:43.631
Um, did you and Jennifer
go see Papa Roach

32:43.665 --> 32:45.332
a year before we went?

32:47.401 --> 32:48.268
<i>What?</i>

32:52.039 --> 32:54.107
Okay, never mind. I...

32:54.141 --> 32:56.009
<i>She told you?</i>

32:56.043 --> 32:58.212
<i>She swore me to secrecy.</i>

32:58.245 --> 32:59.647
<i>It was so hard</i>
<i>not to say anything</i>

32:59.681 --> 33:03.116
<i>when you guys went on and on</i>
<i>about that night you saw them.</i>

33:03.150 --> 33:04.418
<i>When did she tell you?</i>

33:06.788 --> 33:10.792
<i>Um, earlier this year.</i>

33:10.825 --> 33:13.293
Actually, uh,
I thought she was just tryin'

33:13.327 --> 33:14.762
to piss me off.

33:14.796 --> 33:16.497
<i>Vanessa, she literally told me</i>

33:16.531 --> 33:17.765
<i>she would take that</i>
<i>to the grave.</i>

33:19.099 --> 33:20.535
<i>She loved you so much, Ness.</i>

33:22.269 --> 33:23.571
<i>Goddamn it.</i>
<i>I keep thinking like--</i>

33:23.605 --> 33:24.672
I have to go, actually.

33:49.363 --> 33:51.098
Subject seems to be in distress.

33:51.131 --> 33:53.400
Jesus,
you scared the shit out of me.

34:05.212 --> 34:07.649
What? What are you doing?

34:10.183 --> 34:11.251
We do not have this.

34:13.721 --> 34:14.622
What? Tears?

34:16.223 --> 34:17.725
We do not have crying.

34:21.194 --> 34:22.630
This is valuable data.

34:24.498 --> 34:25.432
Thank you.

34:35.142 --> 34:37.779
This is where you hibernate
for six to eight hours nightly?

34:42.316 --> 34:45.285
I hibernate in a jelled capsule
of dioxane.

34:47.321 --> 34:50.324
I awake in three months
feeling rejuvenated.

34:54.929 --> 34:56.496
You look so much like her.

35:00.902 --> 35:01.736
I know.

35:04.271 --> 35:05.840
Everything is exactly the same.

35:07.307 --> 35:09.176
Except for my coccyx bone.

35:10.277 --> 35:12.312
Mine looks like...

35:16.483 --> 35:17.417
Like this.

35:22.590 --> 35:23.591
I wanna show you something.

35:24.959 --> 35:25.793
Okay.

35:31.532 --> 35:32.399

Jennifer and I
never got to see our soda

36:07.334 --> 36:08.201
in the store together.

36:09.804 --> 36:12.807
Seeing soda at the store

Have we arrived at the store?

36:40.333 --> 36:41.468
No, I'm not slowing down.

36:41.501 --> 36:43.571
I-- uh, my foot is on the gas.

36:44.806 --> 36:46.574
Why is the battery charge
going down?

36:48.743 --> 36:50.477
Are you draining us?

36:50.511 --> 36:51.311
Like my phone?

36:52.479 --> 36:54.515
I thought automobiles
were powered by gas.

36:55.215 --> 36:56.951
Not this one. It's electric!

36:58.285 --> 36:59.554
Boogie woogie woogie.

36:59.587 --> 37:01.488
That was Jennifer's favorite
wedding song.

37:01.522 --> 37:02.657
Out. Out of the car.

37:04.826 --> 37:06.359
Damn it. Damn it!

37:10.965 --> 37:13.034
Vanessa, how do I get out?

37:13.067 --> 37:14.769
- It--
Vanessa, how do I get
out?

37:14.802 --> 37:16.571
It's the fucking button.

37:16.604 --> 37:17.505
The button.

37:18.940 --> 37:20.240
Oh. Oh.

37:32.887 --> 37:33.888
What is your plan?

37:35.690 --> 37:37.058
I don't know.

37:37.091 --> 37:40.828
I don't know anything
about cars, but oh, my phone.

37:40.862 --> 37:42.663
I don't have my phone.

37:42.697 --> 37:44.532
I don't have my phone!

37:45.133 --> 37:46.601
Extreme levels of stress

37:46.634 --> 37:48.703
caused by minor deviation
in plan.

37:48.736 --> 37:51.304
It's not a minor deviation,
we are stranded.

37:51.338 --> 37:53.406
Except for this person.

37:54.776 --> 37:57.344
There are vehicles passing by
that are not electric.

37:57.377 --> 37:59.412
We could ask for transportation.

37:59.446 --> 38:00.815
No, I'm not doing that.

38:00.848 --> 38:02.617
Jennifer's memories indicate

38:02.650 --> 38:04.752
that this will
lure male drivers.

38:04.786 --> 38:05.820
What are you do-- s-- no, no!

38:05.853 --> 38:06.654
Put that down.

38:06.687 --> 38:08.455
Get out of the road.

38:08.488 --> 38:09.657
No.

38:09.690 --> 38:10.825
The only people
who pick up hitchhikers

38:10.858 --> 38:11.759
are murderers.

38:11.793 --> 38:12.693
Thank you.

38:14.729 --> 38:17.665
I should be home with Eric
watching him practice

38:17.698 --> 38:19.499
on his stupid fucking bass!

38:21.936 --> 38:24.337
Human has turned anger
onto herself

38:24.371 --> 38:26.908
and Eric's stupid fucking bass.

38:26.941 --> 38:29.442
We're walking. We're walking!

38:29.476 --> 38:30.845
We cannot walk back.

38:30.878 --> 38:32.780
We're walking, that's the plan.

38:32.814 --> 38:34.414
I cannot walk.

38:34.447 --> 38:36.517
Why? Why? Why?

38:39.086 --> 38:40.387
Oh, that's gross.

38:42.824 --> 38:44.992
I have been too long
without oil.

38:47.494 --> 38:48.428
Oh, shit.

38:53.568 --> 38:55.036
Hello!

38:58.039 --> 38:59.406
[engine stops]

39:00.741 --> 39:02.342
Hey, y'all need a jump?

39:02.844 --> 39:04.946
Um, no. No, we're good.

39:04.979 --> 39:06.413
Thank you.

39:07.081 --> 39:09.617
Hey,
you wanna bum another smoke?

39:10.551 --> 39:13.020
Oh, yes. Hello. No, I'm good.

39:13.054 --> 39:16.090
We're-- we're pretty good
across the board, so thank you.

39:16.123 --> 39:17.490
All right.

39:17.525 --> 39:18.826
Nice seeing you again.

39:20.127 --> 39:21.394
-No.
-It's fine. Just--

39:21.428 --> 39:22.730
-No.
-Okay. All right.

39:22.763 --> 39:27.068
Um, actually,
could I use your cell phone

39:27.101 --> 39:28.536
to call Triple A?

39:28.569 --> 39:31.873
Uh, Triple A is a scam. No dice.

39:31.906 --> 39:35.442
If you need a tow, I'll go ahead
and call one of my friends.

39:35.475 --> 39:37.410
No, no, I think we're uh, good.

39:37.444 --> 39:38.913
Vanessa.

39:38.946 --> 39:41.716
This man is offering aid,
which is what we are in need of.

39:41.749 --> 39:43.450
He wants to help.

39:43.483 --> 39:45.519
Yeah,
he wants to help murder us.

39:45.987 --> 39:47.755
Murder is not really my thing.

39:47.788 --> 39:49.824
Mm, I didn't realize
I said that so loud.

39:49.857 --> 39:51.158
Exceptional news!

39:52.059 --> 39:53.761
Holy!

39:53.794 --> 39:55.563
Is this
one of those computer cars?

39:55.596 --> 39:57.098
Uh, yes,
but don't touch it, please.

39:57.131 --> 39:58.065
- Oh, my gosh!
- Okay.

39:58.099 --> 40:00.201
This is some high fancy crap!

40:00.234 --> 40:02.837
It's actually my boyfriend's uh,
car.

40:02.870 --> 40:06.974
Yeah, he's super strong
and it has a tracking device,

40:07.008 --> 40:08.910
so he knows
where we are right now.

40:08.943 --> 40:10.711
Also, he plays bass.

40:10.745 --> 40:12.914
Uh, he sounds
like a pretty cool dude.

40:12.947 --> 40:17.218
Uh, hey, I got a buddy Marcus
who's a huge nerd.

40:17.251 --> 40:18.686
I guarantee
he could hack this thing

40:18.719 --> 40:19.520
in like 20 seconds.

40:19.553 --> 40:21.789
Umm, I don't think we need a
nerd.

40:21.822 --> 40:22.790
No, I think we're good.

40:22.823 --> 40:24.225
No Marcus, I think.

40:24.258 --> 40:25.559
- Okay.
- Yeah?

40:25.593 --> 40:27.561
I'm gonna go ahead and text him.

40:27.595 --> 40:28.896
- Vanessa.
- Hmm.

40:28.930 --> 40:30.497
What does it feel like?

40:30.531 --> 40:31.699
What?

40:31.732 --> 40:33.067
To be unreasonable.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.435
I'm not unreasonable,
we don't know this man.

40:36.837 --> 40:37.638
You're an alien.

40:37.672 --> 40:41.008
Can't you just beam us up,
Scotty?

40:42.209 --> 40:44.477
I do not know
what is beam us up, Scotty,

40:44.512 --> 40:46.479
but I do not think I can do it.

40:48.049 --> 40:49.449
I am parched.

40:51.719 --> 40:53.087
These are pestering me.

40:53.120 --> 40:53.988
Just leave them alone.

40:54.021 --> 40:55.022
Your eyebrows.

40:56.057 --> 40:58.092
Uh, is this a TV in here?

40:58.125 --> 40:58.960
What are you doing?

40:58.993 --> 41:00.661
Can you watch TV
while you're driving?

41:00.695 --> 41:02.129
No! You can't--
sh-- shoo, shoo, shoo.

41:02.163 --> 41:03.731
All right. Dang!

41:05.666 --> 41:06.701
Oh, hey.

41:07.601 --> 41:08.803
Marcus said his shift is
about to end.

41:08.836 --> 41:10.271
He could be here in 25 minutes.

41:10.304 --> 41:12.472
Vanessa, my skin is boiling.

41:13.307 --> 41:15.543
I need oil.

41:15.576 --> 41:17.044
If he kills us,
I'm gonna be pissed.

41:18.579 --> 41:20.247
25? Is that what you said?

41:20.281 --> 41:20.948
Yeah.

41:20.982 --> 41:22.616
Great. We'll wait for Marcus.

41:25.052 --> 41:26.754
You guys want any Subway?

41:26.787 --> 41:28.622
Um, I don't think we...

41:28.656 --> 41:29.991
I-- I think we're good.

41:30.024 --> 41:32.760
All right,
I'm gonna get cold cut trio.

41:45.339 --> 41:46.874
It's a rad jacket.

41:49.910 --> 41:51.112
Hey, so what's your name?

41:53.080 --> 41:55.116
Vane-- la.

41:56.617 --> 41:58.152
What brings you out here,
Vanilla?

42:01.255 --> 42:02.256
I'm celebrating.

42:04.258 --> 42:05.259
What's the occasion?

42:08.963 --> 42:09.797
Do you really care?

42:09.830 --> 42:11.632
We don't have to do this.

42:11.665 --> 42:13.034
Yeah, I care.

42:18.372 --> 42:20.007
A distribution deal.

42:21.242 --> 42:22.576
For what?

42:24.812 --> 42:26.981
My friend and I
made an organic soda.

42:28.115 --> 42:29.250
Organic soda.

42:29.283 --> 42:31.185
Like you put grass in it
or whatever?

42:31.218 --> 42:35.056
What? No, it's just natural
ingredients.

42:35.089 --> 42:36.323
Oh,
I probably wouldn't like that.

42:37.691 --> 42:38.726
That's fine.

42:40.895 --> 42:43.731
So is the party over?

42:43.764 --> 42:47.268
No, uh, it never started
because of my partner.

42:47.301 --> 42:48.335
Oh.

42:49.870 --> 42:51.639
They screw you over
or something?

42:52.706 --> 42:54.575
Yeah. She died.

42:58.179 --> 42:59.246
Uh.

43:01.749 --> 43:02.750
I'm sorry to hear that.

43:04.385 --> 43:05.653
How did she croak?

43:07.254 --> 43:08.322
Hole in the heart.

43:09.957 --> 43:10.925
No one knew.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.928
She had a stroke.

43:16.730 --> 43:18.632
And now, you have a hole
in your heart.

43:20.201 --> 43:22.937
You have a hole in your heart,
'cause you missed a great party.

43:24.271 --> 43:25.840
That's so stupid.

43:25.873 --> 43:27.341
I can't believe
I just laughed at that.

43:30.144 --> 43:32.813
So, did you guys have a clause
in your shareholders agreement

43:32.847 --> 43:35.282
in case of the event
of the death of a partner?

43:38.219 --> 43:39.820
Are you a businessman?

43:40.888 --> 43:41.856
Yeah.

43:42.923 --> 43:43.691
Really?

43:44.325 --> 43:44.892
Yeah.

43:44.925 --> 43:45.926
All right.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.629
Uh, no, we didn't have that.

43:49.830 --> 43:52.433
So, what are you gonna do now?

43:52.466 --> 43:53.834
I don't know.

43:56.270 --> 43:58.706
That's not true.

43:58.739 --> 44:00.374
I'm dissolving her half
of the business

44:00.407 --> 44:03.878
and I'm--
I'll own all the shares.

44:05.412 --> 44:08.816
And now you have to
run the whole thing by yourself.

44:12.386 --> 44:14.188
Man,
she really did screw you over.

44:17.057 --> 44:18.292
Yeah, she really did.

44:24.498 --> 44:25.900
Hey, Marcus.

44:27.268 --> 44:31.205
No, we're on Highway 51,
at the mile marker, uh-- uh--

44:33.040 --> 44:36.343
Marcus? Marcus?

44:38.245 --> 44:40.347
My phone died.

44:40.381 --> 44:42.016
I-- I just charged this.

44:43.851 --> 44:45.019
I can give you guys a ride.

44:46.754 --> 44:48.122
Hop in.

44:48.155 --> 44:49.323
Do you have seatbelts?

44:49.356 --> 44:50.257
No.

46:10.337 --> 46:12.139
This is good. Thanks.

46:14.308 --> 46:16.243
Hey, as soon as my phone
comes back online,

46:16.277 --> 46:18.178
I'll call Marcus
and have him drop the car here.

46:19.213 --> 46:21.448
Oh, great. Thank you so much.

46:21.482 --> 46:22.950
You've been very helpful.

46:22.983 --> 46:23.951
Yeah, no problem.

46:24.885 --> 46:25.819
Hey!

46:25.853 --> 46:26.887
Yeah.

46:27.855 --> 46:29.223
She's not comin' back.

46:31.559 --> 46:33.160
What the fuck?

46:52.112 --> 46:56.884
Vanessa, did you see the hues
of the sunset on our way back?

46:58.218 --> 47:00.354
I have never seen anything
that beautiful.

47:02.256 --> 47:03.857
They were pink and gold.

47:05.359 --> 47:07.027
It made my skin tingle.

47:16.504 --> 47:18.005
Although,
we have arrived to base safely,

47:18.038 --> 47:19.541
the human
has not yet de-escalated

47:19.574 --> 47:20.407
from previous incident.

47:20.441 --> 47:21.342
Will you stop
with that fucking thing?

47:21.375 --> 47:22.443
Just stop!

47:24.512 --> 47:27.147
This weekend
has been exhausting.

47:27.181 --> 47:29.850
You are draining me
like you drained my car.

47:30.984 --> 47:32.520
Vanessa, I am not supposed
to interfere

47:32.554 --> 47:34.021
with your emotive response,

47:34.054 --> 47:36.558
but I do think
you may be overreacting.

47:36.591 --> 47:38.926
I'm overreacting. Me?

47:38.959 --> 47:40.994
This is not about me,
this is about you.

47:41.028 --> 47:43.931
You drained my car
and you forced us

47:43.964 --> 47:45.999
to go into a vehicle
with a stranger!

47:46.033 --> 47:47.901
We don't know him.

47:47.935 --> 47:50.003
And now,
he knows where we're staying,

47:50.037 --> 47:51.405
he has my car.

47:51.438 --> 47:52.306
We will be safe.

47:52.339 --> 47:55.109
You don't know that, Jen!

48:01.415 --> 48:02.983
I apologize.

48:07.655 --> 48:08.623
Thank you.

48:11.058 --> 48:12.259
We could eat something.

48:12.292 --> 48:13.460
Eating is the best.

48:14.094 --> 48:15.462
Sit.

48:15.496 --> 48:16.463
Relax.

48:17.164 --> 48:18.999
Take a sip of--

48:19.032 --> 48:20.702
What is that?

48:20.735 --> 48:22.570
Vodka and tequila.

48:22.604 --> 48:25.573
Okay, take a sip of your vodka
and tequila.

48:25.607 --> 48:27.509
I will create a snack.

48:54.636 --> 48:56.036
I'm sorry.

48:57.438 --> 49:02.042
I think that that guy just um,
really freaked me out.

49:03.177 --> 49:04.311
And um--

49:45.820 --> 49:47.555
Stop it. Stop!

49:54.428 --> 49:58.232
I know you were just trying
to help with that candy face.

50:02.436 --> 50:04.004
I thought
that would make you happy.

50:05.305 --> 50:08.510
Because Jennifer used to do it
for me when I was sad.

50:10.077 --> 50:11.245
You have that memory.

50:11.278 --> 50:12.346
I know, but...

50:14.214 --> 50:17.084
You're not Jennifer, are you?

50:19.554 --> 50:21.054
I am not.

50:27.294 --> 50:29.496
I think in that moment
I just realized that...

50:31.866 --> 50:33.200
Jennifer's never
gonna make me

50:33.233 --> 50:35.035
one of those stupid faces again.

50:38.472 --> 50:40.642
We're never gonna
do anything together again.

50:45.312 --> 50:47.314
We were supposed
to get rich together

50:49.283 --> 50:53.086
and go to France
and Australia together.

50:58.325 --> 51:00.394
Our kids were supposed
to fall in love with each other.

51:03.865 --> 51:08.435
We're supposed to grow old
and go flirt with the servers

51:08.468 --> 51:11.338
at IHOP
for free stuffed French toast.

51:19.146 --> 51:20.548
She's never coming back.

51:54.549 --> 51:56.751
You were not going to do
any of that.

51:59.887 --> 52:00.822
What?

52:02.356 --> 52:04.458
You were not going to
grow old together.

52:05.927 --> 52:07.662
What are you talking about?

52:07.695 --> 52:10.263
You were going to
have an argument.

52:10.297 --> 52:11.431
I don't understand.

52:12.667 --> 52:14.902
Can you see the future
or something?

52:14.936 --> 52:15.837
Yes.

52:18.405 --> 52:20.708
You would have fought.

52:20.742 --> 52:22.777
You would have fought
at this event.

52:22.810 --> 52:23.611
So, what?

52:23.645 --> 52:25.479
We would have fought
at this event

52:25.513 --> 52:27.782
and then
we would have gotten over it.

52:27.815 --> 52:28.783
No.

52:30.317 --> 52:32.754
You would have
never seen each other again.

52:47.267 --> 52:49.537
You said he wasn't
gonna come back to kill us.

52:54.341 --> 52:57.411
Do murderers
usually ring a doorbell?

52:57.444 --> 52:58.746
Who is it?

52:58.780 --> 53:00.848
DJ Twisted Bristle!

53:03.818 --> 53:05.385
Yo, yo!

53:05.419 --> 53:07.454
Why am I forgetting everything?

53:07.487 --> 53:09.356
Uh, where should I set up?

53:09.389 --> 53:10.992
Uh, we don't need a DJ.

53:11.025 --> 53:12.426
I forgot to cancel you

53:12.459 --> 53:14.494
like I forgot
to cancel the party.

53:14.529 --> 53:15.697
What?

53:15.730 --> 53:17.264
Yeah. I'm sorry.

53:17.297 --> 53:18.398
Oh, okay.

53:18.432 --> 53:21.401
Uh, yeah, no-- no worries. Cool.

53:21.435 --> 53:22.870
Uh, all right.

53:24.371 --> 53:28.241
Jennifer's memories indicate
that DJs are fun.

53:28.275 --> 53:29.644
Yeah, but it's weird
to have a DJ play

53:29.677 --> 53:30.712
for just the two of us.

53:30.745 --> 53:31.813
Oh, I got that song.

53:31.846 --> 53:32.747
Just the--

53:33.881 --> 53:34.414
Yeah,
which one do you wannna hear?

53:34.448 --> 53:35.415
The Will Smith version

53:35.449 --> 53:37.384
or the Dr. Evil
and the little guy version,

53:37.417 --> 53:38.686
'cause I got them both.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.621
No, I just meant that it's weird
to have a DJ play

53:40.655 --> 53:42.757
for clearly no one.

53:42.790 --> 53:44.759
Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

53:44.792 --> 53:46.561
Well, if you're worried about
like not havin' a crowd,

53:46.594 --> 53:48.629
I can have my boys here
like in 10 minutes tops.

53:48.663 --> 53:49.831
Absolutely not.

53:49.864 --> 53:51.532
Right, no,
they're probably busy, so yeah.

53:56.070 --> 53:57.739
So should I go or...

53:58.806 --> 53:59.907
Have I paid you already?

53:59.941 --> 54:00.775
You did.

54:00.808 --> 54:03.511
You paid me already, but no tip,
so...

54:04.712 --> 54:06.647
I do still need
to study the physical effects

54:06.681 --> 54:08.649
of increased serotonin levels.

54:08.683 --> 54:11.485
I doubt a DJ is gonna
to increase my serotonin levels.

54:11.519 --> 54:15.656
Oh, that's where you're wrong,
because uh, you know why?

54:15.690 --> 54:17.424
I got molly.

54:23.531 --> 54:24.065
Screw it.

54:24.098 --> 54:24.866
Hell yeah!

54:25.833 --> 54:26.634
No, not inside the house.

54:26.667 --> 54:27.635
Just through the back.

54:27.668 --> 54:29.704
Hell no! Yeah.

54:29.737 --> 54:31.672
Vanessa,
did you see that jacket?

54:31.706 --> 54:33.941
I did.

54:51.559 --> 54:54.896
Tiny pill with woman's name
causes elation and--

54:54.929 --> 54:56.564
Jennifer stopped doing that.

54:56.597 --> 54:57.632
Okay!

55:02.837 --> 55:05.540
This body seems to be designed
for dancing.

55:10.377 --> 55:12.079
You're smiling
and it looks natural!

55:12.113 --> 55:14.414
I am getting used to the bones
in my mouth!

55:16.383 --> 55:17.685
Drug, am I right?

55:17.718 --> 55:20.555
Drugs!

55:21.756 --> 55:23.390
I wanna go somewhere else!

55:23.423 --> 55:24.992
Okay!

55:33.067 --> 55:35.102
Do you know about corn?

55:35.136 --> 55:37.038
The food or the band?

55:37.071 --> 55:39.707
C-O-R-N.

55:39.740 --> 55:41.976
Hmm, the food.

55:42.009 --> 55:44.111
I do know some things.

55:44.145 --> 55:49.650
I know that it's on a cob
and you can pop it.

55:49.684 --> 55:52.153
We believe it
is another alien species

55:52.186 --> 55:54.121
living on your planet in secret.

55:54.155 --> 55:55.823
Shit. For real?

55:55.857 --> 55:57.390
It is a theory.

55:58.993 --> 56:00.161
I'm still thirsty.

56:00.194 --> 56:01.596
Can I have that?

56:01.629 --> 56:03.064
Yes.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.168
Mm.

Eric and I wanna get a condo

58:40.221 --> 58:43.557
because it's
like a step above an apartment.

58:43.591 --> 58:47.895
And then we wanna have babies,
and then we wanna go to Japan,

58:47.928 --> 58:51.966
and go to that
Jiro's Dreams of Sushi

58:51.999 --> 58:53.768
or whatever the place is called.

58:54.602 --> 58:56.203
Oh, that's sweet.

58:57.605 --> 58:59.640
Do you wanna go to Japan
with us?

59:01.242 --> 59:03.744
I wanna go with you anywhere.

59:19.126 --> 59:20.895
You left this at my house.

59:22.196 --> 59:25.099
I was supposed to give it back
before the burial.

59:27.668 --> 59:28.969
I'm sorry, Jen.

59:30.337 --> 59:31.939
It's okay.

59:35.309 --> 59:37.111
I want you to have it now.

1:00:00.701 --> 1:00:02.002
Are you sure?

1:00:09.243 --> 1:00:11.846
No one has ever given me
anything.

1:00:13.881 --> 1:00:15.182
It feels...

1:00:17.318 --> 1:00:18.819
I feel...

1:00:21.755 --> 1:00:23.090
I don't know.

1:00:24.725 --> 1:00:28.129
I never experienced emotions.

1:00:28.162 --> 1:00:30.231
No one on my planet has.

1:00:31.966 --> 1:00:35.169
It is believed to be the reason
we are ahead of your species.

1:00:37.738 --> 1:00:41.809
Jen, you totally have feelings,

1:00:41.842 --> 1:00:45.045
but something about your planet
doesn't let you access them.

1:00:45.079 --> 1:00:48.115
Damn. That's some good molly.

1:00:50.751 --> 1:00:55.055
Perhaps coming here
has developed emotions in me.

1:00:57.725 --> 1:01:01.195
How does it feel
to feel the feelings?

1:01:03.063 --> 1:01:05.833
I do not have the words
to explain.

1:01:09.170 --> 1:01:11.005
Yeah, I don't know either.

1:01:13.340 --> 1:01:16.977
Vanessa, I just remembered

1:01:17.011 --> 1:01:19.713
the sun will rise and set again
tomorrow.

1:01:21.415 --> 1:01:24.852
Yeah. It does that every day.

1:01:27.288 --> 1:01:29.957
That is my favorite part
about it.

1:02:10.364 --> 1:02:13.267
Yo, yo, yo-- oh, you're asleep.

1:02:14.902 --> 1:02:17.238
I'm gonna head out, all right?

1:02:17.271 --> 1:02:19.006
Glad you had a good time.

1:02:19.039 --> 1:02:20.941
I'm gonna take my mic.

1:02:20.975 --> 1:02:23.010
Make sure you like me
on Instagram, right,

1:02:23.043 --> 1:02:25.246
at DJ Twisted Bristle.

1:02:27.281 --> 1:02:29.450
All right, I left some stickers
out on the table.

1:02:29.483 --> 1:02:31.485
You'll find them.

1:03:08.455 --> 1:03:10.190
Jen?

1:03:25.973 --> 1:03:27.474
Jennifer?

1:03:32.046 --> 1:03:33.447
Holy shit.

1:03:41.422 --> 1:03:43.390
Jennifer?

1:03:45.627 --> 1:03:47.161
Jen!

1:03:47.194 --> 1:03:48.162
Jen?

1:03:49.363 --> 1:03:50.998
Hello!

1:03:52.266 --> 1:03:54.501
Oh, my God.

1:03:54.536 --> 1:03:56.470
I thought you were gone.

1:03:56.503 --> 1:03:59.373
I was for a moment,
but I have returned.

1:03:59.406 --> 1:04:01.942
I am sorry if I scared you.

1:04:01.975 --> 1:04:03.344
Where were you?

1:04:03.377 --> 1:04:05.179
We did not reach the store
yesterday,

1:04:05.212 --> 1:04:08.182
so I went and got your soda
from the store.

1:04:08.215 --> 1:04:10.417
Here is the receipt,
so that you can see.

1:04:13.153 --> 1:04:14.955
Thank you.

1:04:14.988 --> 1:04:16.624
I hitchhiked there and back.

1:04:16.658 --> 1:04:19.126
I know you do not like that,
so I went alone.

1:04:25.667 --> 1:04:28.102
What are your feelings?

1:04:29.336 --> 1:04:31.539
I feel great. Thank you.

1:04:36.110 --> 1:04:39.046
I feel happy
that I made you happy.

1:04:39.079 --> 1:04:40.648
You made me very happy.

1:04:42.416 --> 1:04:43.884
I like that.

1:04:45.452 --> 1:04:46.887
Okay. Come on.

1:04:48.355 --> 1:04:50.124
I also bought olive oil,

1:04:50.157 --> 1:04:53.293
because I noticed
I had depleted your supply.

1:04:53.327 --> 1:04:55.996
Oh, it's the house's,
but thank you.

1:05:09.977 --> 1:05:11.979
Oh,
they really marked up our soda.

1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:14.682
Can I try it?

1:05:14.716 --> 1:05:16.283
Yes, of course!

1:05:16.316 --> 1:05:18.118
It's the whole point.

1:05:32.767 --> 1:05:35.570
I like the flavor of cardamom.

1:05:35.603 --> 1:05:37.971
Really?

1:05:38.005 --> 1:05:39.674
Uh, Jennifer always fought me
on that.

1:05:40.742 --> 1:05:42.476
Uh.

1:05:45.479 --> 1:05:48.248
So, what are we doin' today?

1:05:48.282 --> 1:05:52.352
You're gonna make me run a mile,
solve a Rubik's cube?

1:05:52.386 --> 1:05:54.221
I have completed my research.

1:05:55.690 --> 1:05:57.057
You have?

1:05:58.192 --> 1:06:01.028
I finished organizing everything
early this morning,

1:06:01.061 --> 1:06:03.397
so that we did not have to work

1:06:03.430 --> 1:06:05.132
and we could
spend the day together

1:06:05.165 --> 1:06:06.734
before I depart this evening.

1:06:09.336 --> 1:06:10.738
Oh, right.

1:06:12.674 --> 1:06:15.342
I thought
you were leaving tomorrow.

1:06:15.375 --> 1:06:16.678
No.

1:06:16.711 --> 1:06:19.279
I leave tonight at 11:32 p.m.,

1:06:19.313 --> 1:06:21.516
exactly 48 hours
after I arrived.

1:06:24.151 --> 1:06:26.588
Okay, but uh, we didn't meet
till the next morning,

1:06:26.621 --> 1:06:29.691
so shouldn't they, I don't know,
start the clock there?

1:06:31.358 --> 1:06:32.493
They do not.

1:06:33.661 --> 1:06:35.229
Why not?

1:06:35.262 --> 1:06:36.631
I do not know.

1:06:51.078 --> 1:06:54.214
You know, it's really insane
what you guys do.

1:06:54.248 --> 1:06:57.785
You know, you come here
and you-- you torture humans

1:06:57.819 --> 1:07:00.555
who are already going through
the worst shit of their lives.

1:07:01.623 --> 1:07:03.257
It's not a good plan.

1:07:03.290 --> 1:07:04.424
You should rethink it.

1:07:09.196 --> 1:07:10.832
I did not torture you.

1:07:10.865 --> 1:07:11.933
I would never do that.

1:07:11.966 --> 1:07:16.036
Oh, are we not just um, animals
at the zoo to you?

1:07:16.871 --> 1:07:18.706
'Cause I thought that was
in the presentation.

1:07:18.740 --> 1:07:19.541
You know what?

1:07:19.574 --> 1:07:20.542
You guys are like--
you're like--

1:07:20.575 --> 1:07:24.846
you're like those people
who dress like pandas

1:07:24.879 --> 1:07:26.446
to go into panda cages.

1:07:28.248 --> 1:07:30.450
I do not know
who these people are.

1:07:30.484 --> 1:07:31.853
They're liars is who they are.

1:07:31.886 --> 1:07:33.487
They're lying to the pandas.

1:07:37.892 --> 1:07:40.294
I do not understand.

1:07:40.327 --> 1:07:42.496
I was truthful to you
about my research.

1:07:43.598 --> 1:07:44.766
You are upset.

1:07:44.799 --> 1:07:46.333
I'm not upset! I'm just--

1:07:47.735 --> 1:07:49.269
I'm a little upset.

1:07:49.303 --> 1:07:50.838
I just don't think
that you should go yet.

1:07:54.509 --> 1:07:56.376
I must return.

1:07:56.410 --> 1:07:58.111
I have completed my assignment.

1:07:58.145 --> 1:08:00.782
No, you have not
completed your assignment.

1:08:00.815 --> 1:08:03.450
You can't just figure me out
in 48 hours.

1:08:03.483 --> 1:08:04.451
That's nuts.

1:08:04.484 --> 1:08:07.755
It's less than 48 hours,
by the way, technically.

1:08:11.626 --> 1:08:12.492
Oh!

1:08:12.527 --> 1:08:13.360
This is just like you.

1:08:13.393 --> 1:08:14.562
This is just like you!

1:08:14.596 --> 1:08:15.663
You're always cutting corners!

1:08:15.697 --> 1:08:16.831
You're just like this!

1:08:16.864 --> 1:08:18.566
Like this.

1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:21.569
I haven't seen Two Rings
on the shelves.

1:08:21.603 --> 1:08:22.837
All you did was
bring me something

1:08:22.870 --> 1:08:25.773
I've seen a million times
and some trash.

1:08:36.383 --> 1:08:37.819
I did not think about that.

1:08:37.852 --> 1:08:39.787
Yeah, you don't think.

1:08:39.821 --> 1:08:41.488
This is exactly why
I didn't take

1:08:41.522 --> 1:08:43.625
that distribution deal
six years ago.

1:08:48.596 --> 1:08:49.897
You feel guilt?

1:08:50.898 --> 1:08:55.469
We could have had this party
six years ago!

1:08:55.502 --> 1:08:57.270
We could have been
doing business together

1:08:57.304 --> 1:08:58.740
for six years!

1:09:00.307 --> 1:09:02.577
And maybe...

1:09:02.610 --> 1:09:04.311
What are you saying?

1:09:04.344 --> 1:09:05.747
That she would have lived?

1:09:08.816 --> 1:09:11.586
Maybe she would have had
enough money

1:09:11.619 --> 1:09:13.286
for good health insurance,

1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:14.589
and she could have had
a physical,

1:09:14.622 --> 1:09:16.390
and they would have
seen her heart.

1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:22.195
That would not have
changed anything.

1:09:23.363 --> 1:09:25.533
W-- it-- it wouldn't have?

1:09:25.566 --> 1:09:26.934
You tell me.

1:09:26.968 --> 1:09:28.368
You're the one
who could see the future.

1:09:28.402 --> 1:09:30.672
Would--
if we had taken the offer,

1:09:30.705 --> 1:09:32.940
would she still be alive?

1:09:38.478 --> 1:09:39.747
I do not know.

1:09:41.883 --> 1:09:43.851
I do not see the future.

1:09:45.419 --> 1:09:46.788
I lied to you.

1:09:48.890 --> 1:09:49.924
Why would you lie to me?

1:09:51.324 --> 1:09:52.426
Why would you do that?

1:09:53.628 --> 1:09:55.495
Because you were crying.

1:09:57.765 --> 1:09:59.901
Jennifer lied to you,
so you would not hurt,

1:09:59.934 --> 1:10:02.737
so I lied to you,
so you would not hurt.

1:10:04.337 --> 1:10:05.506
I was emotional.

1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:06.774
That is the problem.

1:10:06.808 --> 1:10:09.811
I cannot
start feeling like this.

1:10:10.545 --> 1:10:12.613
What are you doing?

1:10:12.647 --> 1:10:13.981
What are you doing?

1:10:14.015 --> 1:10:16.884
I should have not allowed myself
to get close to you.

1:10:18.351 --> 1:10:19.620
What-- what is that?

1:10:19.654 --> 1:10:20.855
What did you do?

1:10:20.888 --> 1:10:23.024
I have some in my superiors
to retrieve me.

1:10:23.057 --> 1:10:24.458
They will reward me

1:10:24.491 --> 1:10:25.793
for completing my assignment
early.

1:10:25.827 --> 1:10:26.761
Reward you with what?

1:10:26.794 --> 1:10:28.495
An extra vitamin injection?

1:10:28.529 --> 1:10:29.463
Maybe!

1:10:30.765 --> 1:10:32.033
Turn it off!

1:10:32.066 --> 1:10:32.700
No!

1:10:32.734 --> 1:10:33.300
Cancel it!

1:10:33.333 --> 1:10:34.535
It cannot be cancelled!

1:10:34.569 --> 1:10:36.003
We were gonna hang out!

1:10:36.037 --> 1:10:38.740
We have like eight more hours,
that's a lot.

1:10:48.381 --> 1:10:49.684
I am sorry!

1:10:59.861 --> 1:11:01.896
Jennifer, don't do that, please.

1:11:12.874 --> 1:11:14.341
I am not Jennifer.

1:11:25.352 --> 1:11:26.020
What are you doing?

1:11:29.724 --> 1:11:31.726
Your efforts are futile.

1:11:31.759 --> 1:11:33.761
Not going home!

1:11:33.795 --> 1:11:35.395
It is indestructible.

1:11:35.428 --> 1:11:36.597
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

1:11:36.631 --> 1:11:37.632
Check this out.

1:11:45.807 --> 1:11:47.942
No! No!

1:11:48.910 --> 1:11:51.411
The device is programmed
to return to me.

1:11:51.444 --> 1:11:53.014
That's a stupid thing
for your device to do

1:11:53.047 --> 1:11:54.949
and you're a--
you're a stupid alien.

1:11:57.151 --> 1:11:59.486
That is the last thing
you want to say to me?

1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:00.555
No! No!

1:12:00.588 --> 1:12:01.756
I also want to say,

1:12:03.423 --> 1:12:05.092
"F you and F your planet!"

1:12:31.418 --> 1:12:35.790
Wait! No! No, no, no!

1:12:35.823 --> 1:12:36.791
What are you doing?

1:12:36.824 --> 1:12:39.327
No, don't take her yet.

1:12:41.762 --> 1:12:45.398
Vanessa, that is an airplane
from Earth.

1:12:56.476 --> 1:12:58.779
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1:13:02.016 --> 1:13:04.552
I ruin everything.

1:13:04.585 --> 1:13:06.419
I should have just
spent the day with you.

1:13:09.090 --> 1:13:10.925
I have regrets as well.

1:13:14.829 --> 1:13:16.697
I reacted impulsively.

1:13:17.965 --> 1:13:20.067
I wish I had not
summoned them early.

1:13:22.036 --> 1:13:23.671
I messed up with Jennifer.

1:13:25.206 --> 1:13:28.142
I should have had more fun
with her when she was here.

1:13:29.977 --> 1:13:31.512
Said "yes" more.

1:13:34.715 --> 1:13:36.416
She loved you, Vanessa.

1:13:38.152 --> 1:13:40.521
It is not complicated
to see why.

1:13:42.590 --> 1:13:43.925
I know she loved me.

1:13:47.494 --> 1:13:49.096
We would have been
best friends forever.

1:14:03.010 --> 1:14:05.579
Would you like to hug Jennifer
one last time?

1:14:08.983 --> 1:14:10.518
Jennifer is gone.

1:14:18.626 --> 1:14:20.227
They will be here soon.

1:14:28.569 --> 1:14:30.004
Are you sure you can't stay?

1:14:30.838 --> 1:14:32.106
I am sure.

1:14:33.808 --> 1:14:35.743
But now, I look forward
to seeing the sunset

1:14:35.776 --> 1:14:37.511
on my own planet.

1:14:40.047 --> 1:14:41.882
Now, I have to lose you.

1:14:44.685 --> 1:14:47.822
What we once enjoyed,
we can never lose.

1:14:47.855 --> 1:14:51.092
All that we love
becomes a part of us.

1:15:08.209 --> 1:15:09.744
Wait here.

1:15:09.777 --> 1:15:12.747
I wanna grab something,
so you don't forget me.

1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:33.801
Shit.

1:15:35.903 --> 1:15:37.605
Oh, my God.

1:17:53.874 --> 1:17:55.342
Hey, sorry,
I missed your FaceTime.

1:17:55.376 --> 1:17:59.380
I was practicin' the bass,
but is-- is everything okay?

1:17:59.413 --> 1:18:02.416
I was thinking
we should throw a party.

1:18:02.449 --> 1:18:04.051
A-- a party?

1:18:04.084 --> 1:18:05.319
Yeah.

1:18:05.352 --> 1:18:10.157
Um, something
to celebrate Jennifer's life.

1:18:10.191 --> 1:18:12.793
Yeah. O-- okay.

1:18:12.826 --> 1:18:15.062
Y-- you sound really good.

1:18:15.095 --> 1:18:17.765
Yeah, I'm okay.

1:18:17.798 --> 1:18:19.033
You sure?

1:18:20.401 --> 1:18:25.105
