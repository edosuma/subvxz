01:36.138 --> 01:38.004
<i>It's Mr. Hicks
from the school again.</i>

01:38.432 --> 01:40.424
<i>This is the third time
I've called</i>

01:40.517 --> 01:42.317
<i>about the incident
that happened this morning.</i>

01:44.396 --> 01:45.396
<i>Look,</i>

01:45.480 --> 01:47.142
<i>we both know Elijah is
a good kid.</i>

01:48.150 --> 01:49.150
<i>And...</i>

01:49.443 --> 01:51.480
<i>I know your family's
been through a lot lately,</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:54.153
<i>but I have been seeing
some changes in him</i>

01:54.239 --> 01:55.639
<i>that I'd like to
talk to you about.</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:57.116
<i>So please,</i>

01:58.827 --> 02:00.387
<i>give me a call back
as soon as you can.</i>

02:00.454 --> 02:02.161
<i>All right? Thanks. Bye.</i>

02:09.588 --> 02:10.588
I called your dad.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.089
He can't make it.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.676
Come on, I'll drive you home.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.878
<i>What's up?
You got another haul for us, or what?</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:56.902
<i>Almost there.</i>

03:57.195 --> 03:58.195
What's copper at?

03:58.780 --> 04:01.488
Copper and aluminum,
70 cents a pound this week.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.802
Hello?

05:23.114 --> 05:24.230
Anyone there?

05:30.747 --> 05:31.747
Hello?

05:48.974 --> 05:49.974
Oh, my God.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.038
Elijah.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.207
Elijah!

07:38.959 --> 07:40.075
Suspension, huh?

07:43.838 --> 07:46.581
Get your shoes on.
I need your help out back.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.770
Why you getting in fistfights, son?

08:06.569 --> 08:07.776
He was talking about Mom.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.449
Come here.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.703
Come here, sit down.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.626
You know,

08:23.795 --> 08:25.081
if I'm hard on you,

08:26.589 --> 08:27.921
it's because the world is hard.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.426
You've seen that.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.511
But this,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.554
this is not what your mom would've wanted.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.063
Come on, come on.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.478
You take my tool box.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.480
We're gonna need a third place
for dinner tonight.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.156
Your brother got out.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.030
I want you to be careful around him.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.261
Remember what I told you.

09:20.769 --> 09:21.769
El i.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.896
Man...

09:24.481 --> 09:27.098
Six years didn't seem like
such a long time until just now.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.487
You got big.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.210
Hey.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.745
This is just for a week or two.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.466
I know.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.802
Thanks.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.912
Let's go see what you did to my digs.

10:13.988 --> 10:14.988
What are those?

10:15.990 --> 10:16.901
My shoes.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.152
You wear those in public?

10:20.328 --> 10:21.614
I'm saving for new ones.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.075
With what? Dad's cheap-ass allowance?

10:26.209 --> 10:27.666
Oh, you got a little

10:28.461 --> 10:29.827
lemonade stand thing going?

10:31.673 --> 10:32.673
I can respect that.

10:37.762 --> 10:41.176
Hey, I got a pair of Chucks
hiding in a trunk around here somewhere.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.942
If I find them, you can have them.
Sound good?

10:45.937 --> 10:48.850
Cool. 'Cause those smell like shit, man.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.156
Wow.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.053
You guys wouldn't believe
how much you miss

11:01.077 --> 11:02.238
a home-cooked meal in prison.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.372
Glad you like.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.249
I do.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.298
Those are new.

11:14.924 --> 11:15.924
Yeah.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.217
You like them?

11:17.760 --> 11:18.760
These...

11:19.804 --> 11:21.136
ward off evil spirits.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.013
That one wards off Mexicans.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.275
Sorry.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.111
Just glad to be home.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.363
What's your next step?

11:39.324 --> 11:40.484
- I'm gonna get a job.
- Yeah?

11:41.618 --> 11:42.618
Doing what?

11:44.454 --> 11:45.454
Well, actually,

11:45.580 --> 11:47.391
I was hoping that you might
put in a good word for me

11:47.415 --> 11:49.095
- down at the site you're working on.
- No.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.542
Can't do that.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.582
- Why not?
- Because I can't clear an ex-con.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.071
- If you told them I was your son...
- Doesn't work that way.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.428
Great, so...

12:02.513 --> 12:05.256
- Six years, no visit, no word.
- I visited.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.012
Once, to tell me my mom was dead.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.228
Thanks, Hal.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.433
And I come home, no complaints.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.766
I just ask one small favor,

12:15.151 --> 12:17.129
and you'd rather see your own son
flipping burgers?

12:17.153 --> 12:18.360
Better than being a thief.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.859
I gotta step out, bro. I'm sorry.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.240
I got people I need to see.

12:29.874 --> 12:30.990
Don't bother waiting up.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.311
Hey.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.804
Jimmy. Taylor told me to come through.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.378
He's got this bag on his head.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.360
They got the shovel, right?
Because they're gonna, you know...

13:21.384 --> 13:22.545
Afterwards, right?

13:23.011 --> 13:24.673
He swings back, hits...

13:25.263 --> 13:26.970
Hey, Solinski!

13:27.849 --> 13:28.930
Welcome home, my man.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.517
Remember my brother, Dutch?

13:31.853 --> 13:32.853
Yeah.

13:32.979 --> 13:33.979
How's it going?

13:37.984 --> 13:38.984
That's Remy.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.101
Don't worry about him, he's in a time-out.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.148
Tay, man, come on.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.980
Stick your nose back in that corner.

13:45.783 --> 13:46.983
That is, if you wanna keep it.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.697
Contemplate that shitty attitude.

13:50.997 --> 13:51.997
So, Jimmy...

13:52.665 --> 13:54.657
You wanna burn one
or just get right to it?

13:55.877 --> 13:58.119
I'm good, I don't wanna take up
any of your time.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.580
I just came by to say

14:01.299 --> 14:03.006
that I know I owe you guys some money.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.713
And I'm taking that real serious.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.635
Good. 'Cause protection ain't cheap.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.590
Dutch, what's he into us for?

14:11.017 --> 14:12.017
Sixty?

14:17.523 --> 14:18.523
You don't got our 60?

14:19.776 --> 14:20.776
No.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.153
No, but I just wanted you guys to know
I'm not dodging you.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.074
Man.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.570
That is a bummer.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.038
You see, Jimmy,

14:33.790 --> 14:35.201
me and my brother, we don't...

14:36.250 --> 14:38.492
We don't project any illusions about

14:38.961 --> 14:40.873
who we are or what we do, you know?

14:41.506 --> 14:44.874
We were very clear that first day,
post-charges or what have you,

14:45.635 --> 14:47.467
about how we deal with loans.

14:48.846 --> 14:49.846
Because,

14:50.848 --> 14:52.589
there are people who do business like you.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.012
And there's people
that do business like us.

14:58.523 --> 14:59.523
So...

15:00.441 --> 15:02.294
Is there something funny
about the language on that

15:02.318 --> 15:03.434
you didn't understand?

15:04.612 --> 15:07.195
Some kind of... fine print problem?

15:07.281 --> 15:08.281
No.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.284
No.

15:11.702 --> 15:12.702
Because,

15:13.621 --> 15:16.329
we know you have a father.
What's his name, Harold?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.492
And that... little colored brother,
too, right?

15:21.337 --> 15:22.337
I got that right?

15:22.880 --> 15:23.996
Yeah. Yeah.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.291
I mean, I guess
we can go collect from them.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.552
Hang on. I was just saying
I didn't have it here.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.015
I didn't say I don't have it.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.648
Okay, then.

16:27.737 --> 16:28.737
What?

16:28.946 --> 16:30.733
They... They were right here.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.920
Have a good night.

18:18.848 --> 18:19.848
Jimmy,

18:20.016 --> 18:21.016
I wanna help you.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.184
I really do.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.921
But you gotta understand something.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.015
'Cause you've got a decade

18:30.818 --> 18:32.810
of bad decisions under your belt.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.531
You're gonna have to work
at some jobs that you don't like.

18:40.995 --> 18:44.079
You have to gain experience.
You're gonna have to gain trust.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.166
Now, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.088
No, we should talk now.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.639
60K.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.722
I need $60,000.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.793
I didn't want to ask you,
but I've got no other options.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.810
What? $60,000?
I don't have that kind of money.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.442
- Look, you gotta hear me out, okay.
- No, no, I don't.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.988
No. Not in my house.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.034
- Whatever it is, I'm not interested.
- There's a safe in your office.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.948
Please, I will never ask you
for anything ever again.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.241
- I swear.
- You want me to steal for you?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.076
Let you steal, what's this?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.810
- This isn't for me.
- Who's it for, then?

19:33.381 --> 19:34.917
- Who?
- Dangerous people.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.873
People you can't just not pay back.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.963
These guys kept me alive in jail.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.260
If I don't pay them back,
who knows what they'll do.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.870
Do you understand what I'm trying...

19:43.099 --> 19:44.635
I'm trying to help you guys.

19:44.892 --> 19:45.928
You get out of my house.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.538
- Get out of my house. Out.
- Dad. Dad.

19:48.396 --> 19:49.396
Dad.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.492
You know, I really hoped
I was gonna come back

19:54.527 --> 19:56.268
to the house that time forgot, but...

19:57.863 --> 19:59.104
you've made some changes.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.650
My room, that's gone.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.116
You got your replacement son
sleeping up there in my bed.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.995
You've erased every trace of me.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.907
What do you think Mom would've said?

20:20.720 --> 20:21.920
Don't you talk about your mom.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.797
Now you get out of my house.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.760
I'm not gonna tell you again.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.077
Here's a list.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.653
Things I need done today.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.247
All of this?

20:49.290 --> 20:50.451
Before I get home.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.201
You don't go to school, you work for me.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.568
Look at this guy.

21:19.737 --> 21:20.737
He's a chump.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.530
You say something?

21:23.407 --> 21:24.864
You trying to hurt my family?

21:59.735 --> 22:00.735
What is this?

22:02.446 --> 22:05.359
Well, there's a bunch of old scrapyards
that pay money for...

22:05.449 --> 22:06.449
You're scrapping now?

22:08.285 --> 22:09.285
Where?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.327
Just this place off Grand River.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.539
Does this place...

22:13.207 --> 22:15.665
Does it have a fence around it
and a locked gate?

22:15.751 --> 22:17.431
Does it have a sign that says, "Stay out"?

22:18.295 --> 22:19.295
Huh?

22:19.755 --> 22:20.755
Yes.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.205
All right.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.087
I've got a list of property developers
at my office

22:25.719 --> 22:27.335
that you and I are gonna go down there,

22:27.680 --> 22:31.424
and you are gonna call each
and every single one of these places...

22:31.517 --> 22:33.133
Dad, it's just a bunch of old metal.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.559
It's not yours, Elijah.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.063
None of it.

22:38.399 --> 22:39.399
Go get in the truck.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.837
- Dad, I didn't...
- Do I call the police? What?

22:41.861 --> 22:42.861
What am I gonna do?

22:45.948 --> 22:46.948
No.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.203
It was just stuff
that's been sitting there for years.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.411
Everything that has ever been stolen

22:56.500 --> 22:58.366
was something that was just sitting there.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.192
I don't even know why I listen to you.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.373
You don't have a choice in that, kid.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.254
- I'm your father.
- No, you're not.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.365
The only reason I'm here
is because you guys wanted

23:10.389 --> 23:12.472
some kind of replacement kid.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.028
Look at me.

23:28.532 --> 23:30.273
You are nobody's replacement.

23:32.870 --> 23:33.986
Your mother is...

23:34.622 --> 23:36.033
She's not here anymore.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.704
But you are our son.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.708
And now it is my job to raise you right.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.551
And I am doing the best job that I can

23:50.429 --> 23:51.465
without her.

23:55.768 --> 23:56.849
I love you, son,

23:57.603 --> 23:58.810
and that's why we're here.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.136
Stay in the truck.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.360
- Dad?
- "Dad?"

24:53.450 --> 24:55.533
Shit. Look, you can't be here.
You gotta turn around.

24:55.619 --> 24:56.619
This is Dad?

24:56.787 --> 24:58.528
Whoa, whoa, hold on. You gotta leave.

24:58.831 --> 24:59.831
Hey, Dad.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.449
- Hang on, man.
- What are you doing in here?

25:03.627 --> 25:05.539
We're just taking the money
out of this safe.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.395
Dad, you gotta get out of here right now.

25:08.674 --> 25:09.674
Just turn around,

25:10.050 --> 25:11.416
just walk out of here, trust me.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.924
I don't know what my son promised you,

25:15.014 --> 25:19.008
but that is not his to give,
and it is not yours to take.

25:19.935 --> 25:20.935
It isn't?

25:21.228 --> 25:22.685
- No.
- Taylor, please, man,

25:22.771 --> 25:24.082
- this doesn't have anything...
- Jimmy.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.291
It's got nothing to do
with him, all right?

25:25.315 --> 25:26.396
Your father was talking.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.278
Please. You were saying?

25:31.405 --> 25:33.021
I don't have a gripe with you.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.308
But we gotta put all the money back?

25:38.996 --> 25:39.996
You do.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.358
- All right, hang on.
- No, look...

25:43.459 --> 25:44.459
I love this part.

25:51.633 --> 25:52.669
Please, Dad.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.100
No, no!

26:12.613 --> 26:14.275
Dutch. Dutch.

26:18.452 --> 26:19.943
Dad. Dad.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.870
Dad, Dad, hold on, hold on.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.207
No, no, no, no.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.110
Shit!

27:02.246 --> 27:03.306
- What's up?
- What are you doing?

27:03.330 --> 27:04.696
Where's... Where's Dad?

27:27.813 --> 27:29.224
You see that chain that was broken?

27:29.690 --> 27:30.690
- No.
- At the...

27:31.441 --> 27:32.441
At the south gate?

27:33.235 --> 27:34.235
Yeah.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.227
These guys broke in and they...

27:36.780 --> 27:39.864
dumped over a whole shit-ton
of concrete back there.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.158
And he called you to pick me up?

27:42.244 --> 27:44.201
Yeah. Yeah, why wouldn't he?

27:45.956 --> 27:47.618
Well, I heard you two arguing last night.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.417
Yeah?

27:51.295 --> 27:52.295
How much did you hear?

27:52.796 --> 27:54.076
Well, he was kind of pissed off.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.671
I heard him kick you out.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.631
Yeah. We're family, that shit happens.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.010
Well, why are you so sweaty?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.680
Huh?

28:04.683 --> 28:06.094
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.477
Yeah, it's fine, man.

28:52.940 --> 28:53.940
Guess so.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.068
Yeah.

28:58.654 --> 28:59.654
He's here.

29:02.532 --> 29:03.532
You wanna talk to him?

29:04.910 --> 29:06.276
All right, yeah. Sounds good.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.287
Bye.

29:10.791 --> 29:11.791
What?

29:13.085 --> 29:15.005
Sounds like it's a real shit-show
out there, man.

29:15.504 --> 29:17.245
That spill's gonna take
a week to clean up.

29:17.506 --> 29:18.587
Round-the-clock shifts.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.211
He said something about after-school...

29:22.010 --> 29:23.046
- Daycare.
- Daycare?

29:23.804 --> 29:26.217
- I'm 14, I'm not six.
- I told him, I told him.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.429
We gotta pull together, dude.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.522
I mean, I know I've been away
for a long time.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.900
And you've been busy
with school and stuff.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.023
I got suspended.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.238
No shit?

29:42.864 --> 29:44.400
Well, even more reason, then.

29:45.409 --> 29:46.409
For what?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.505
I told Dad that we should go
on a road trip.

29:48.829 --> 29:49.829
Me, you, and him.

29:50.289 --> 29:53.373
Well, just me and you at first,
but he'll come find us later.

29:54.084 --> 29:55.165
We could go out west.

29:55.252 --> 29:56.252
Lake Tahoe.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.043
Mom loved it out there.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.646
Hey, it's gotta be warmer than here, man.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.679
And Dad's okay with this?

30:09.433 --> 30:11.015
Yeah. He's fine with it. I called him.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.933
You wanna talk to him? Call him.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.933
Look, you wanna have an adventure
or you wanna do chores?

30:24.406 --> 30:25.406
I know what I'm doing.

30:29.995 --> 30:30.995
Great.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.079
Go pack some shit.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.621
- Now?
- We're out of here in 10.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.054
Come on, come on, come on.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.062
Yo. All right, you ready?

30:58.565 --> 30:59.565
Give me that bag.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.067
Nice.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.966
Did you put your whole room in here?

31:04.738 --> 31:05.738
All right, jump in.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.031
Let's go, come on.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.193
Toss this shit.

32:10.637 --> 32:11.844
Hey, there he is.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.222
Rise and shine, welcome to Iowa.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.594
Man, I'm starving.
How about some breakfast?

32:58.852 --> 33:00.388
By the time we came of age,

33:00.812 --> 33:03.646
the game to beat down on Klinger Street...

33:05.567 --> 33:07.149
This fella named Big Reggie.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.238
Never forget...

33:12.324 --> 33:14.065
the day Big Reg

33:14.659 --> 33:16.446
decided to lay claim to my Walkman.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.946
I came home crying and bleeding.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.909
When he saw the state I was in,
before I knew it,

33:24.002 --> 33:25.538
we were walking back up the block

33:25.629 --> 33:27.712
to... Big Reggie's house.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.707
Dutch busted in the door,

33:32.427 --> 33:35.295
caught him on the shitter,
and stabbed him six times in the ear.

33:36.556 --> 33:37.556
For me.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.017
He did it for me.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.429
If I'd have known how
you were gonna end up...

33:50.487 --> 33:52.023
would've kept this Walkman on me

33:53.156 --> 33:54.317
every day of my life.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.530
You were a monster, Dutchy.

34:06.336 --> 34:07.702
And I'll love you forever for it.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.097
Thank you for coming.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.018
Find Solinski.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.437
I want his head.

37:31.791 --> 37:32.872
Hey! Who's there?

37:33.960 --> 37:35.880
Come on, guys.
You're not supposed to be in here.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.831
<i>This is Hal. Try the office
or leave a message.</i>

39:05.009 --> 39:06.009
Hey, Dad.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.429
Jimmy says you're busy,
so I hope everything's okay.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.467
I guess we'll see you in Tahoe.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.271
All right.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.308
Oh, and I'm sorry...

39:22.861 --> 39:23.861
for stealing.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.608
You know, if you're still mad,

39:26.698 --> 39:29.031
and if you still want me to make
those phone calls, I will.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.579
I miss you.

39:34.747 --> 39:35.747
Bye.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.092
Tay.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.177
Tay.

39:50.263 --> 39:53.472
This cell you got off that dead guy,
it rang while you were asleep.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.057
Some guy named Jimmy left a message.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.160
Tell Snick we're gonna need his phone guy.

40:06.863 --> 40:07.863
Now.

40:08.781 --> 40:09.781
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

40:09.991 --> 40:11.277
<i>Jimmy says you're busy, so...</i>

40:15.121 --> 40:16.121
Jimmy.

40:16.706 --> 40:17.706
Jimmy.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.083
- Jimmy.
- What?

40:21.377 --> 40:23.217
We're supposed to check out
twenty minutes ago.

40:25.924 --> 40:26.924
Okay.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.212
Go pull up the truck.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.261
I can't drive.

40:31.804 --> 40:34.592
- Yeah, you can. Nobody gives a shit.
- No, look, I don't know how.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.314
You got it. All right,
lock the wheel to the left.

40:41.397 --> 40:42.416
Like this, are you serious?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.648
Yeah, yeah, yeah. More gas, more gas.

40:45.735 --> 40:46.735
Yeah, hold it.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.062
- Now?
- Now.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.700
There you go.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.288
Yeah.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.659
Yeah!

41:00.583 --> 41:02.916
Sweet. Keep it going,
come on, come on, come on.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.794
Yeah, keep going,
tighter, tighter, tighter!

41:06.089 --> 41:07.876
Come on! Come on!

42:02.186 --> 42:03.186
I'm sacked.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.228
You wanna call it quits
in the Rockies tonight, man?

42:06.649 --> 42:07.649
Yeah, all right.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.232
Hey, are you into performance art?

42:13.114 --> 42:14.321
Is that your kind of thing?

42:31.257 --> 42:32.338
Are you sure this is okay?

42:32.550 --> 42:33.550
Definitely.

42:34.177 --> 42:35.177
Thousand percent.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.555
What's that for?

42:38.598 --> 42:39.839
That's for the girls you like.

42:41.976 --> 42:43.308
You guys been taken care of?

42:44.228 --> 42:45.228
Well,

42:45.688 --> 42:47.771
I'm gonna have a shot and a beer,

42:48.274 --> 42:50.231
and my older brother here
is gonna have a pop.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.315
- What's your name?
- Venus.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.571
I'm Jimmy. Pleasure to meet you.

43:05.750 --> 43:06.750
Have you talked to Dad?

43:07.335 --> 43:08.335
Yeah.

43:08.961 --> 43:09.961
We were texting.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.623
I told him we were behaving ourselves.

43:16.677 --> 43:17.677
Thank you, Venus.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.180
Cheers.

43:28.106 --> 43:29.106
Whoa.

43:29.732 --> 43:30.732
Here we go.

44:08.646 --> 44:09.646
I like her.

44:10.022 --> 44:11.022
She seems nice.

44:12.233 --> 44:13.815
Hey, Steve. Can I get a whiskey?

44:14.443 --> 44:15.443
Thanks.

44:19.407 --> 44:20.407
I'll take a beer.

44:26.122 --> 44:27.122
So who's your friend?

44:29.709 --> 44:31.120
Oh, he's my brother.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.536
Adopted, obviously.

44:34.714 --> 44:36.634
And do you think it's a good idea
that he's here?

44:39.051 --> 44:40.167
Well, he's 14,

44:40.761 --> 44:43.504
he's surrounded by beautiful,
half-naked women,

44:43.598 --> 44:45.806
and I'm giving him
as much pop as he wants, so...

44:47.018 --> 44:48.930
- Yeah, I'd say it's pretty good.
- Right.

44:52.023 --> 44:53.355
I have a lot of money on me.

44:54.192 --> 44:57.230
I'm looking to get pretty drunk,
he's looking to get pretty caffeinated,

44:57.695 --> 44:59.402
and it would be great if you'd join us.

45:04.076 --> 45:06.363
Hey, the kid's asking, not me.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.369
Can I get another round of shots?

45:19.425 --> 45:21.257
Chug, chug, chug, chug.

45:33.689 --> 45:34.689
Where you guys headed?

45:35.399 --> 45:36.856
A cottage near Tahoe.

45:38.194 --> 45:39.935
It was my mom's favorite place to go to.

45:41.781 --> 45:42.781
So we're going there.

45:42.949 --> 45:44.468
And your dad, he let you get in the car

45:44.492 --> 45:46.859
with this crazy guy, this maniac?

45:46.953 --> 45:47.953
I guess.

45:48.329 --> 45:50.070
Hey, we're here to do life lessons.

45:50.790 --> 45:52.577
He's here to become a man,
aren't you, bro?

45:55.378 --> 45:57.165
Is it working? Do you feel manly yet?

46:00.216 --> 46:01.496
Let me tell you something, okay?

46:02.051 --> 46:04.509
Coming to a place like this
never made anybody a man.

46:05.096 --> 46:06.096
Ever.

46:06.973 --> 46:09.056
Your brother's cool, he's fun, but...

46:10.601 --> 46:11.933
He's about as grown as you are.

46:13.187 --> 46:14.303
You can tell him said that.

46:14.522 --> 46:16.684
- Milly, you're up next, girl.
- I gotta go.

46:19.527 --> 46:20.527
Be good.

46:21.362 --> 46:22.362
Okay.

46:23.239 --> 46:24.239
Oh, hey.

46:25.283 --> 46:26.283
Yeah?

46:28.995 --> 46:29.995
It's for you.

46:30.246 --> 46:31.246
You guys got to leave?

46:34.125 --> 46:35.125
Thank you.

46:44.135 --> 46:45.135
You got her number?

46:45.594 --> 46:46.594
No.

46:51.309 --> 46:52.309
Okay, look, you...

46:52.476 --> 46:54.388
You asked me before if I had a girlfriend.

46:55.354 --> 46:56.354
I don't.

46:58.190 --> 47:00.471
It's just I don't talk to many kids
in my grade, you know?

47:01.861 --> 47:04.478
Just never felt like I fit in,
like anywhere, really.

47:04.697 --> 47:05.983
Hey, an outsider, man.

47:07.783 --> 47:08.783
I dig that.

47:09.702 --> 47:10.702
Cheers.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.081
What's up with you and Dad?

47:24.216 --> 47:26.879
I mean, he never talks about you much,
and when he does, he's...

47:28.179 --> 47:29.179
always mad.

47:30.973 --> 47:31.973
Me and Dad...

47:33.934 --> 47:35.534
We were just never there for each other.

47:37.229 --> 47:38.229
And now...

47:43.361 --> 47:45.148
Why are we talking about this shit, man?

47:45.988 --> 47:47.570
I mean, we're on vacation here, right?

47:47.656 --> 47:49.272
We're supposed to be enjoying ourselves.

47:49.492 --> 47:51.609
Let's just try and enjoy tonight, okay?

47:52.870 --> 47:53.870
Cheers, brother.

47:57.333 --> 47:58.915
Perfect. There's <i>Sparkles.</i>

47:59.251 --> 48:01.091
I'm gonna go have a dance with her,
watch this.

48:02.171 --> 48:03.171
Jimmy.

48:03.756 --> 48:04.756
Jimmy.

48:05.383 --> 48:06.669
- Hey!
- You can't be up here.

48:06.759 --> 48:08.679
Seriously, you can't be up here.
Mike, it's fine.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.599
- Whoa, whoa!
- It's okay. It's fine, it's fine.

48:10.638 --> 48:12.220
- I know her, man.
- Off the stage.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.117
- It's fine.
- Whoa, whoa. Hang on, I know her.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.723
- Jimmy.
- What are these guys...

48:16.060 --> 48:17.180
You can't come up here, man.

48:17.686 --> 48:18.686
It's Lyle Lovett.

48:19.772 --> 48:22.059
- Lee, actually.
- It's a nice place, Lyle.

48:22.316 --> 48:24.252
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna have a dance with this girl.

48:24.276 --> 48:25.608
No, silly boy,

48:26.070 --> 48:28.187
we don't allow johns on the stage.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.966
If it wasn't for all that cash
you're throwing down,

48:29.990 --> 48:31.760
we wouldn't let your
little friend here, neither.

48:31.784 --> 48:33.821
- Lee, I got it, he'll sit down.
- Bitch,

48:35.246 --> 48:37.112
who told you to stop dancing?

48:38.290 --> 48:41.078
You got two seconds
to start shaking that ass.

48:41.168 --> 48:42.375
Whoa.

48:43.254 --> 48:44.916
That's not how you talk to women, man.

48:48.551 --> 48:49.632
All right, how about this?

48:49.969 --> 48:50.969
You guys,

48:51.762 --> 48:54.095
all right, just look the other way,

48:55.141 --> 48:56.507
buy yourselves a drink. On me.

48:57.309 --> 48:58.675
Jimmy! Leave him alone!

48:59.478 --> 49:01.014
Stop! Calm down!

49:03.899 --> 49:05.310
- Stop!
- Move.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.313
He's mine.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.118
- Stop!
- Zip it, bitch.

49:19.665 --> 49:20.665
Let him go.

49:24.336 --> 49:25.336
Let him go,

49:27.047 --> 49:28.047
and we'll leave.

49:51.739 --> 49:52.739
Come on, we're leaving.

49:54.617 --> 49:55.617
Let's go.

49:55.910 --> 49:56.910
Give me your keys.

49:56.994 --> 49:57.994
Milly!

49:58.746 --> 50:00.106
I hope you know what you're doing.

50:01.123 --> 50:02.123
Yeah, me, too.

50:37.701 --> 50:38.701
I found it.

50:39.078 --> 50:40.078
Found it where?

50:40.412 --> 50:42.028
This place I've been going for scrap.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.076
You found this thing in a vacant?

50:44.583 --> 50:46.728
- Let me see.
- You're drunk and you have a concussion,

50:46.752 --> 50:48.744
- I really don't...
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

50:49.630 --> 50:50.950
I just want to see it, all right?

50:51.423 --> 50:53.506
Man, somebody's got to be
looking for this thing.

50:54.134 --> 50:55.134
Oh, shit.

50:56.929 --> 50:57.929
What happened?

50:58.430 --> 50:59.295
It just closed up.

50:59.390 --> 51:00.430
Maybe it doesn't like you.

51:00.641 --> 51:02.507
- You try it.
- I'm not touching that thing.

51:08.691 --> 51:09.691
Make it work.

51:16.532 --> 51:17.693
It likes you just fine, huh?

51:17.783 --> 51:19.783
I didn't even know
what it can do until back there.

51:20.202 --> 51:22.122
Yeah, but you had a pretty good idea,
didn't you?

51:23.455 --> 51:24.455
Well, shit, man.

51:24.790 --> 51:25.790
Let's see it again.

51:26.333 --> 51:27.733
Light up that haystack right there.

51:29.128 --> 51:31.745
Come on, man, don't be shy now.
You got this.

51:38.721 --> 51:39.757
Holy shit.

51:41.015 --> 51:43.098
Oh, my God, did you see that?

51:43.183 --> 51:44.424
Yes, I saw that.

51:45.394 --> 51:46.475
All right, don't stop now.

51:46.937 --> 51:47.937
Please be careful.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.562
This shit is crazy.

51:57.072 --> 51:59.985
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

52:00.075 --> 52:01.441
Oh, my God.

52:01.827 --> 52:03.159
That thing is a cannon.

52:03.662 --> 52:04.698
It's insane.

52:05.080 --> 52:07.663
I can't believe we just left this thing
in the back of the truck.

52:08.083 --> 52:09.949
What, you want me
walking around with this?

52:10.044 --> 52:11.080
I can't believe this guy.

52:13.297 --> 52:14.297
Wow.

52:14.381 --> 52:16.168
Those guys' faces back at the club.

52:20.095 --> 52:21.095
Shit.

52:21.555 --> 52:23.046
- What?
- Jimmy, what?

52:23.140 --> 52:25.507
- Shit. Shit!
- What?

52:26.644 --> 52:27.644
My bag.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.558
My bag with all my money,
I left it in the bar.

52:31.899 --> 52:33.099
Well, how much are we talking?

52:33.692 --> 52:35.979
- Sixty, seventy.
- What, thousand?

52:36.070 --> 52:37.606
- Yeah.
- Thousand?

52:37.988 --> 52:39.650
Sixty grand and a space gun?

52:39.907 --> 52:41.523
Who the hell are you people?

52:41.784 --> 52:42.864
Get in the truck, let's go.

52:45.829 --> 52:46.829
Come on.

52:47.331 --> 52:48.617
Point that thing backwards.

52:50.417 --> 52:52.750
Are you guys serious?

52:58.884 --> 53:00.466
Twenty, forty, fifty...

53:01.095 --> 53:03.838
Sixty, one, two, three and sixty-four.

53:09.228 --> 53:10.228
Sorry.

53:31.458 --> 53:32.790
'Cause this is the Ritz, right?

53:51.228 --> 53:52.228
Sorry.

53:54.022 --> 53:55.022
It does that.

53:55.649 --> 53:56.649
Okay.

54:00.571 --> 54:01.571
Here.

54:03.449 --> 54:04.449
Thanks.

54:09.413 --> 54:10.773
Where'd you get that on your hand?

54:12.458 --> 54:13.458
My parents.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.283
Well, my original ones.

54:16.587 --> 54:17.587
Mom or Dad?

54:18.881 --> 54:19.881
I don't know.

54:20.466 --> 54:21.832
I mean, I was just a baby, so...

54:22.176 --> 54:23.576
That's how you wound up with the...

54:25.012 --> 54:26.012
From a shelter.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.471
I mean, I was just
a couple months old, so...

54:34.438 --> 54:35.438
Check it out.

54:36.315 --> 54:38.602
My parents gave me these, for crying.

54:41.153 --> 54:43.987
Yeah. Sometimes people who aren't ready
to have kids have them anyway.

54:48.702 --> 54:49.702
What'd you do?

54:51.371 --> 54:52.371
At the time?

54:53.874 --> 54:55.536
Probably kept on crying.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.956
Yeah, I left home eventually.

55:01.924 --> 55:04.404
When I was, I don't know,
a couple years older than you, maybe?

55:06.553 --> 55:08.010
Been on the move ever since.

55:11.475 --> 55:13.216
You know, I've had to say "peace"

55:13.310 --> 55:15.927
to pretty much everyone I've ever met.

55:18.023 --> 55:19.264
It's pretty messed up, huh?

55:19.483 --> 55:20.483
Yeah.

55:24.988 --> 55:25.988
Hey.

55:27.241 --> 55:28.241
Don't hide it, okay?

55:29.701 --> 55:30.942
It's proof you're a survivor.

55:33.831 --> 55:34.831
And it looks cool.

55:45.884 --> 55:47.000
Where can I take a piss?

55:48.053 --> 55:50.295
Bathroom's for employees only, friend.

56:10.242 --> 56:12.282
Can't go if you're gonna be
staring at me like that.

56:36.059 --> 56:37.059
Tay, man.

56:39.229 --> 56:40.229
Look...

56:40.480 --> 56:43.814
the guys are wondering
if we're planning on stopping for a rest.

56:45.485 --> 56:47.477
Kid said Tahoe, so we're going to Tahoe.

56:48.196 --> 56:49.476
They can rest when they're dead.

56:51.909 --> 56:53.491
Watch yourself, it's slippery there.

56:59.166 --> 57:00.166
So what's your angle?

57:01.960 --> 57:03.667
Don't get me wrong, I mean, I like you.

57:04.504 --> 57:06.040
I know he really likes you.

57:07.382 --> 57:09.444
But you can't expect us to believe
you just joined us

57:09.468 --> 57:11.068
out of the goodness of your heart, so...

57:11.428 --> 57:12.428
Yep.

57:13.138 --> 57:15.450
The plan was to rob you
and bail in the middle of the night,

57:15.474 --> 57:17.466
but, oh, wait, you're broke.

57:19.227 --> 57:20.843
- You're an asshole.
- You're an asshole.

57:30.030 --> 57:31.566
I was stuck there, all right?

57:34.076 --> 57:37.160
Lee has a way
of getting girls he likes to stay,

57:38.413 --> 57:39.745
as long as he sees fit.

57:41.208 --> 57:42.208
You feel me?

57:44.544 --> 57:46.825
The two of you guys walking in there,
handing it to him...

57:48.298 --> 57:49.298
First I'd ever seen that.

57:52.052 --> 57:54.972
I got in your truck because you guys
seemed like some good guys, you know.

57:56.014 --> 57:58.631
Plus, if you... did try anything funny,

57:58.725 --> 58:01.045
I'm pretty sure even I could take you
in a fistfight, so...

58:07.150 --> 58:08.150
To fistfights.

58:19.538 --> 58:20.538
That...

58:22.249 --> 58:23.249
thing...

58:23.792 --> 58:24.999
your brother has in there...

58:27.462 --> 58:29.419
You need to call someone about that.

58:29.506 --> 58:30.506
Can't do that.

58:31.967 --> 58:32.967
Right.

58:37.639 --> 58:38.639
Well,

58:39.474 --> 58:43.309
whatever it is you've gotten him into,
he's gonna figure it out eventually.

58:44.896 --> 58:46.056
I hope you're ready for that.

58:51.069 --> 58:52.810
What if I knew a way
to get your money back?

58:56.867 --> 58:58.028
But if I tell you,

58:58.994 --> 58:59.994
I want a cut.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.321
I want a cut of everything you get,

59:04.207 --> 59:05.539
over the money you need returned.

59:06.877 --> 59:08.243
And you guys give me a ride west.

59:13.133 --> 59:14.133
You ever rob anyone?

59:16.261 --> 59:17.261
It's been a minute.

59:19.931 --> 59:20.967
What about card games?

59:23.060 --> 59:24.801
Look, man, it's your choice, either way,

59:25.353 --> 59:27.060
Okay? But I've gotta do this.

59:30.734 --> 59:32.214
Look, I just don't wanna hurt anyone.

59:33.153 --> 59:34.689
We're not, that's what I'm saying.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.612
We're gonna scare 'em,
but we're not gonna hurt 'em.

59:40.827 --> 59:41.827
Promise.

59:44.206 --> 59:45.206
Promise.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.125
And besides, we got a giant ray gun, dude.

59:50.212 --> 59:51.874
They're gonna be pissing in their pants.

59:58.678 --> 59:59.678
Okay.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:01.087
Lee's here, that's his truck.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:09.730
You ready?

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:12.102
You got this.

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:27.915
Hey.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:30.543
This is some real shit.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:32.442
They're not messing around in there.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:34.505
Neither are we.

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:50.729
All right.

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:52.690
Okay, ready?

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.150
Let's go.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:05.286
Okay.

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:11.245
Jimmy, you didn't say anything
about a cow farm.

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:22.377
- I'm in the drink.
- Look at the big shot here.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:30.638
I'm being played.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.768
Remember, you're the boss, okay?

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:42.237
Three, two, one.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:45.448
All right, hands up!

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:47.777
Hey. This is a robbery.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.287
Hands up, you know what this is.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.209
All right.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.667
Lyle, you stand up.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:57.796
On your feet.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.216
Up.

01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:03.988
Now, did you tell all your buddies

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:05.924
about our little incident
back at the club?

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:07.306
Huh?

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:10.447
Did you tell these guys what happens
when the kid fires that thing?

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:12.684
Huh?

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.639
Do we need another demonstration
of the ray gun?

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:20.860
Clever. All right,
here's what's gonna happen,

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:23.209
me and this guy are gonna walk to the pot,

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.778
the rest of you are gonna stay here
and play the statue game.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:28.953
Lyle,

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:30.403
I'd like my money back.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.114
Let's go.

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:54.639
Okay, okay, okay.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:58.893
Jimmy, please hurry up.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.352
Come on. Come on.

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:06.356
- He ain't coming back, kid.
- Stop talking.

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:09.445
And don't look at me, either.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:19.795
Is that for me?

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:23.257
Thanks.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:25.583
All right, keep them up,
nothing's changed.

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:27.877
Go. Get out of here. All right.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680
Guys,

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.718
genuinely sorry for the interruption.

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.303
I'll take my leave.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:34.727
Oh, and Lyle?

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:36.937
Milly sends her love.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:40.441
Get them!

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:43.483
Go, go, go! Go!

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:46.028
Go! Left! Go left!

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:48.943
Get up, kid, come on!

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.988
They're coming, man, move, move, move!

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:57.249
Quick, through there!

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:03.375
Out of the way, cows!

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:05.673
Come on, come on, come on!

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:08.838
- Go, go, go, go!
- Guys, we gotta go!

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:10.763
- Jimmy!
- Come on.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.181
Eli, let's go!

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:14.076
- Guys! get into the truck.
- Eli, get in the truck!

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.100
Get in the car right now!

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:16.852
Eli, we gotta move!

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.360
Later, bitches!

01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:36.954
I can't believe you flipped his truck.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.908
Eli, you are one
big-balled son of a bitch!

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:41.959
That was amazing, dude.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.045
- Well...
- How'd we do?

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:46.372
- I got a bag of money here.
- Yes, I knew it!

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:50.042
I happened to obliterate his nuts.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.341
Why thank you, you are my hero, cowboy.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:55.764
Like that, huh?
What do you think about that, huh?

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:57.370
- Yeah.
- What do you think about that?

01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:59.195
Yeah.
[- What do you think of that, brother?

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:01.522
Yeah!

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:42.956
Elijah.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.334
Morning, sleepyhead.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:49.379
Breakfast slushie?

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:52.591
No, I'm good.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:54.718
Suit yourself.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:57.346
So tell me, kid.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:58.838
How's it feel to be rich?

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:00.766
I don't know.

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:04.556
But seriously,
Dad's not gonna be cool with this.

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.315
Well...

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:11.228
Nevada's 10 miles away.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.193
We're on a hot streak.

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.229
<i>Should we keep that shit going?</i>

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.372
Hey. How's your room?

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:07.699
It's got two beds.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:09.626
Nice.

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:16.341
I'm glad you're here.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.511
I wanted to talk to you
about something. Sit down.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:28.770
All right.

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:37.277
It's been pretty incredible...

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.028
this last little while
that we've had to...

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.661
be brothers for the first time.

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:54.002
I wanna make sure that you know

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:56.332
that this is important to me.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:59.252
And you're important to me.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.888
And there's something
that I've gotta tell you,

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.176
and...

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.185
It's kind of hard to get out.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:14.733
Hey, guys.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.934
Check out what I got in the gift shop.

01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:19.193
Pretty cool, huh?

01:09:20.238 --> 01:09:21.238
It's cool.

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.471
- I'm sorry, did I...
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:28.203
I was gonna go
to the tables anyways, so...

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.372
We can talk about this later, man, yeah?

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:39.241
- I didn't mean to interrupt, sorry.
- It's fine, it's fine.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:40.841
Hide your gun.

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.469
Keep the door locked.

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:43.636
Yeah.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.587
- Jimmy, you okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:48.975
Jimmy.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:55.357
He's fine.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:00.487
So...

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:03.150
What do you wanna do?

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:06.404
We could...

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:08.735
go downstairs and find you a girlfriend.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:39.818
Can I use your phone?

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.229
- Who you calling?
- My dad.

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:45.509
He's still coming to meet you, right?

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:46.927
- Everything's...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:48.487
Just wanted to talk to him.

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:52.038
Yeah, okay.

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:56.293
- Thanks.
- No worries.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:04.069
<i>Police are now confirming
that the two suspects in the murder</i>

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.959
<i>are Harold Solinski's own sons.</i>

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:08.052
<i>Twenty-eight-year-old James Solinski</i>

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.256
<i>and his adopted
African-American brother...</i>

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:11.885
- What?
<i>- ...14-year-old Elijah.</i>

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.142
<i>According to police,</i>

01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:16.936
<i>Elijah Solinski has
no previous criminal history.</i>

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:20.878
<i>...extensive criminal background,</i>

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:23.110
<i>including multiple felony convictions.</i>

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:26.279
<i>Authorities believe James
to be the likely ringleader</i>

01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:29.408
<i>and are strongly urging caution
in the event of any sightings,</i>

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.781
<i>as they believe James
to be armed and dangerous.</i>

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:35.155
<i>Police have previously revealed
the identity of the victim</i>

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:37.206
<i>killed during the robbery
as Harold Solinski,</i>

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:40.206
<i>a local area man, who neighbors
have described as hard-working...</i>

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:42.955
Eli. Eli, we have to go.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.881
Come on, come on.

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:49.719
I'm so sorry. Thank you so much.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:56.935
Two-hundred on black.

01:11:58.231 --> 01:11:59.767
- Young man, young man!
- Eli!

01:11:59.857 --> 01:12:00.857
Excuse me, sir.

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.170
- He can't be here.
- I know. I'm so sorry,

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.275
I'll grab him. I'm sorry.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:05.982
We got a minor on the floor.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:17.698
Hey.

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.311
- It's all right.
- Did you do it? Huh?

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.792
- It's all right.
- Huh?

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:21.958
What are you talking about?

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:23.878
- You lied, you lied.
- Stop it.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:26.799
I can't believe this whole time,
you haven't told me this.

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:29.124
- Wait a minute. What you talking about?
- You're a liar.

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.177
- All right.
- You killed him, Jimmy.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:32.800
- All right?
- You did.

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:35.112
Listen, I know you wanna hit me right now,

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.142
but we gotta go, okay?

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:37.263
Come on, we gotta go.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.580
- We gotta go now.
- Get off of me.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:39.890
<i>Security to the main floor.</i>

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:42.034
- Yeah.
<i>- Security needed on the main floor.</i>

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:30.706
Tay, look, I think we might have
something here, man.

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:33.083
Just got sent this from Audre.

01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:35.335
He's in Nevada, cops got him.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.555
Looks like we're headed
to Sulaco County, boys.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:43.812
Let's go.

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:47.355
Try and hide, Jimmy.

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:50.142
Try and fucking hide.

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:00.537
Okay. Let's

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:01.621
go.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:18.430
Here you go, kid.

01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:37.030
They treating you all right?

01:15:41.328 --> 01:15:44.036
- They haven't charged you...
- Jimmy, they only gave me 10 minutes.

01:15:57.678 --> 01:15:59.590
It didn't happen the way
they're saying, okay?

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:03.016
Eli.

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.095
Me and these guys...

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.267
We were stealing money from his safe.

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:12.857
That part's true.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.402
I owed them money.

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:17.688
And they were gonna kill me
if I didn't do it, and...

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:20.141
they were gonna kill you guys, too.

01:16:30.211 --> 01:16:31.327
Dad walked in...

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:34.839
and...

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:36.549
I begged him.

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:39.302
Eli.

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:41.844
Eli, look at me, please.

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:45.674
I pleaded with him

01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:48.893
to turn around and walk out the door.

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:50.230
But he wouldn't do it.

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:00.989
I know I'm not a good guy.

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:03.512
But there was nothing I could do

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:04.554
- in the situation.
- Jimmy.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.298
I didn't want any of this...
Stop talking.

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:12.037
If he was hard on us...

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:15.587
it's because the world is hard.

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:20.166
A good man does the right thing,

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:23.837
even when it's not the easy thing.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:30.597
My father taught me that.

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:33.898
I'm sorry.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.820
I'm sorry.

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:40.196
I don't know what to say.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:41.906
Eli.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:44.403
Eli, wait.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.131
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for a...

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:03.552
Caucasian degenerate brought in here
a couple hours ago?

01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:05.037
Had a little black fellow with him?

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:06.097
Yeah?

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:07.932
And who are you?

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:09.851
They here?

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:14.099
I couldn't give you
that information even if they were.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:15.848
- Okay, pal?
- Got it.

01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:37.921
Shots fired.

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:47.513
Yeah, they're here.

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:03.863
Take it off.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:14.540
Hello?

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:22.046
- Freeze, freeze!
- Show me your hands!

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:35.594
Get back behind that desk.

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:37.558
I'll hold them. I'll hold...

01:19:38.232 --> 01:19:40.474
Hey... My bag?

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:42.860
Where is it?

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:48.366
Please.

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:50.243
You've seen what I have.

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:57.375
Evidence lockup.

01:19:57.668 --> 01:19:59.330
Down the hall, through the door.

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:02.588
Stay low.

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:15.727
Cover the front.

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:23.266
Find them. He's here somewhere.

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:27.354
Come on, come on, come on.

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:42.619
I got one!

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.340
No!

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:50.760
No, no.

01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:53.139
No.

01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:54.724
Mondays, right?

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:56.392
No!

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:07.278
Eli?

01:21:22.753 --> 01:21:23.753
Look at you, Jimmy.

01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:27.418
Went and found yourself another jail cell.

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:33.429
This is nice.

01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:36.756
Someone get me some keys!

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:42.683
Come on, big boy.

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:44.857
Fuck.

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:53.903
Where's your little brother?

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:55.535
Huh?

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:57.412
Huh?

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.162
I'm gonna do something I want him to see.

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:12.793
Morgan Hunter, FBI.

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:14.806
- Well, we're all set if you wanna go in.
- Okay.

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:18.182
Gun!

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:28.776
Get back, go, go!

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:30.570
Go!

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:32.738
Now watch him.

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:34.991
He likes to run.

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:39.495
Oh, boy.

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:40.908
Hey.

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:44.999
You're pretty scruffy-looking.

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:54.258
Hey.

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:56.381
Get away from my brother.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:58.842
So...

01:23:00.601 --> 01:23:01.721
What the hell is that thing?

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:34.842
You all right?

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:36.344
Stay down!

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:42.970
Hey. Where are you guys? Come on!

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.676
- Any ideas?
- What?

01:23:44.895 --> 01:23:46.102
Got any ideas?

01:23:52.069 --> 01:23:53.069
What the hell was that?

01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:55.982
What the hell was that?

01:23:58.951 --> 01:24:01.364
Dude, he's reloading! Shoot him now!

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:02.787
Go!

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:14.459
Well, that's one way to do it.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:20.888
Be careful, man.

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:29.981
Get down!

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:42.908
Eli, talk to me!

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:47.038
Talk to me, Eli!

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.376
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:25:10.981 --> 01:25:12.973
Maybe keep that thing
on the first mode, yeah?

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:35.087
I got this, okay?

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:37.465
Stay behind me.

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:45.139
Come on, man.

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:49.138
Zero One NCL, we've got
two unknowns in the lobby.

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:00.945
<i>In the lobby, you are surrounded.</i>

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:02.397
<i>Lay down your weapons</i>

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:03.823
<i>and get on your knees.</i>

01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:05.869
You never should've had
to go through any of this.

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:12.497
Be more like Dad.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:15.211
Less like me.

01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:19.292
Just be better than me.

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:27.369
Check it out, go around the building.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.400
Listen, man,

01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:40.226
I don't have the words,

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.030
and you don't have to forgive me.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.818
But you have to know how sorry I am.

01:26:57.671 --> 01:26:58.912
<i>TAC squad in position.</i>

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:02.050
Lock your fingers
and put your hands on your head.

01:27:03.677 --> 01:27:05.517
When they come in,
just do everything they say.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:12.476
Jimmy.

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:15.894
I think we'll be okay.

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:21.318
I love you, kid.

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:34.373
All this for me, huh?

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:38.037
Looks like we all die today.

01:27:38.128 --> 01:27:39.128
No.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.041
Heard a lot about you, kid.

01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:44.256
Nice to finally meet you.

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:47.756
I had a brother, too, once.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:51.140
Jimmy met him.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.100
Didn't you?

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:01.696
I got a vehicle approaching
the north perimeter.

01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:09.448
<i>You got two bikes coming at you fast!</i>

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:11.818
<i>This is the police!</i>

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:13.911
<i>You're approaching an active crime scene!</i>

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:15.488
We got two bikes approaching!

01:28:15.582 --> 01:28:17.289
<i>Stop or we will open fire!</i>

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.619
Don't look. Don't look.

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:24.877
<i>- I repeat, we will shoot!</i>
- Open fire!

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.047
Eli, stay down, stay down.

01:28:34.684 --> 01:28:35.684
Stop them!

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:42.931
Things we do for brothers, huh?

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:48.897
- Breach the door! Go! Go!
- Go, go, go!

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:52.066
No! Eli!

01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:14.323
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:19.586
All right, let's just talk a minute.
All right?

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:22.788
We're not here to hurt you.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.960
But that weapon?

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.500
We're gonna need that back.

01:30:27.297 --> 01:30:28.297
It doesn't belong here.

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:31.780
I'm gonna need you to trust me, okay?

01:30:35.472 --> 01:30:36.472
Elijah...

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:39.097
You're one of us.

01:30:43.813 --> 01:30:45.850
Look, let me show you, all right?

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:49.693
Under that scar?

01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:52.356
It's the reason
why you're able to operate that thing.

01:30:55.325 --> 01:30:57.362
Those soldiers you found in that factory,

01:30:58.036 --> 01:30:59.152
they were sent to kill you.

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:01.369
We took them out, but...

01:31:01.998 --> 01:31:03.614
you weren't supposed to see any of that.

01:31:05.752 --> 01:31:06.752
Listen.

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.296
Look at me.

01:31:14.761 --> 01:31:15.761
Come on, man.

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:18.220
I'm going to need you
to hand this gun over

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.034
- because we're running out of time.
- We got two minutes.

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:21.218
It's okay, this is important.

01:31:21.726 --> 01:31:23.308
It's okay. Come on. There you go.

01:31:23.687 --> 01:31:25.269
Come on, relax.

01:31:25.647 --> 01:31:26.647
It's okay.

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:36.323
Thank you.

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:42.285
Hey. Don't worry about her.

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:44.280
She's just looking for a doorway.

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:46.417
Back to our world.

01:31:48.712 --> 01:31:49.712
And yours.

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:53.668
You were hidden here to keep you safe.

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:56.341
Because our people are at war, Elijah.

01:31:57.929 --> 01:31:59.249
Right now you're still too young.

01:32:00.974 --> 01:32:02.215
But we are gonna need you, man.

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.184
Soon enough.

01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:07.563
I got one.

01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:17.448
Kind of cool, huh?

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:27.958
Come on.

01:32:29.794 --> 01:32:30.794
What about my brother?

01:32:40.597 --> 01:32:42.805
Hey, your brother? He's gonna be fine.

01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:47.712
Doesn't look good for him, though.

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:49.646
Sixty seconds.

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:51.398
Look,

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:53.246
I know things have been
tough for you here.

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:54.943
And all this?

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:56.485
It ain't making it any easier.

01:32:57.781 --> 01:32:59.581
But remember, just because
you're by yourself,

01:33:00.533 --> 01:33:01.819
doesn't mean you're alone.

01:33:05.705 --> 01:33:06.705
You've got me.

01:33:10.877 --> 01:33:12.477
You've just looked out for your brother.

01:33:17.509 --> 01:33:19.216
And now I'm doing the same thing for mine.

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:23.928
We'll be seeing you again.

01:33:24.891 --> 01:33:25.891
We're all counting on it.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:06.972
Don't move! Drop your weapon.

01:34:07.058 --> 01:34:08.424
- Get down!
- Let's see your hands.

01:34:08.518 --> 01:34:09.518
Left clear.

01:34:10.019 --> 01:34:11.019
Let me see your hands!

01:34:11.104 --> 01:34:12.498
- I'm unarmed!
- Hands behind your head.

01:34:12.522 --> 01:34:13.683
- Don't move!
- I'm unarmed.

01:34:17.569 --> 01:34:18.569
You're all right?

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:20.353
It's gonna be okay, Eli.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:21.780
We're going to be okay.

01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:24.827
Find those two riders,
they're in here somewhere.

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:26.201
Check the back.

01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:46.814
I found the statement
you were giving inside.

01:34:48.474 --> 01:34:50.636
Your brother seems to be
matching it blow for blow.

01:34:51.144 --> 01:34:52.760
With the exception of a few things.

01:34:55.273 --> 01:34:57.060
I'd say he's covering for you.

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:02.273
Which I might just
advise you to let him do.

01:35:06.242 --> 01:35:07.322
What's gonna happen to him?

01:35:09.287 --> 01:35:10.619
He's gonna go away for a while.

01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:17.160
But if he keeps cooperating,
it might not be for as long as he thinks.

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:24.439
Are you gonna tell me
where that weapon is?

01:35:29.974 --> 01:35:30.974
Okay.

01:35:35.146 --> 01:35:36.146
We're not done.

01:36:06.302 --> 01:36:07.338
Yo, Eli!
