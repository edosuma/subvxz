<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:04.246 --> 00:07.541
There are many safe and ethnically diverse
neighbourhoods in Pittsburgh.

00:07.625 --> 00:10.377
- Shane, who are you talking to?
- Dad.

00:13.255 --> 00:15.049
I need to rent your empty house.

00:15.132 --> 00:17.176
We need a grow house.
Can you deal with that?

00:17.259 --> 00:20.054
Hello, Eve Meriweather,
education coordinator,

00:20.137 --> 00:22.681
Absolute Truth Ministries campus.

00:22.765 --> 00:25.351
The wrath of Doug. It's coming.

00:25.434 --> 00:29.063
What kind of man tears a cross
off the roof of a church?

00:29.188 --> 00:32.441
An impressive one, I'm guessing.
That's a big fucking cross.

00:32.524 --> 00:35.694
I read an article in the paper
about this cross of theirs that got stolen.

00:35.778 --> 00:37.112
I think I just found it.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.241
- You got a call.
- From who?

00:40.324 --> 00:43.536
Roy Till. He's with the DEA.

00:43.619 --> 00:46.372
- I have questions.
- You do?

00:46.455 --> 00:48.624
Our business arrangement's
not gonna work out.

00:48.707 --> 00:49.750
And why's that?

00:49.833 --> 00:52.336
My customers
don't seem to like your product.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.796
That's a shame.

00:53.879 --> 00:56.423
Three guys on motorcycles
pulled me out of the car.

00:56.507 --> 00:59.218
They said they're coming after you,
after all of us.

00:59.301 --> 01:00.886
So what do you want from me?

01:00.970 --> 01:03.639
What kind of protection would I get
for half of everything?

01:03.722 --> 01:06.183
Anyone fucks with you, they fuck with me.

01:06.267 --> 01:09.311
When they go down, they go down hard.

01:09.395 --> 01:10.437
Fine.

01:10.521 --> 01:14.149
The fire started in their grow field.
Someone torched it.

01:14.233 --> 01:17.111
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

01:28.038 --> 01:30.833
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:30.916 --> 01:33.544
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:33.627 --> 01:36.213
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:36.297 --> 01:38.591
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:38.674 --> 01:41.343
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:41.427 --> 01:43.971
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:44.054 --> 01:46.515
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:46.599 --> 01:49.268
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:50.436 --> 01:53.314
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

01:53.397 --> 01:55.774
<i># All went to the university</i>

01:55.858 --> 01:58.444
<i># Where they were put in boxes</i>

01:58.527 --> 02:00.988
<i># And they came out all the same</i>

02:01.071 --> 02:03.699
<i># And there's doctors and lawyers</i>

02:03.782 --> 02:06.535
<i># And business executives</i>

02:06.619 --> 02:09.913
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

02:09.955 --> 02:13.250
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

02:15.669 --> 02:19.381
<i>Good morning. After a long night
battling darkness, treacherous conditions,</i>

02:19.465 --> 02:20.841
<i>and high walls of flame,</i>

02:20.925 --> 02:24.678
<i>fire-fighters still do not have
this searing blaze under control.</i>

02:24.762 --> 02:27.556
<i>The west end of the charter school is gone.</i>

02:27.640 --> 02:30.893
<i>We're trying to save the worship hall now,
but we're just not equipped...</i>

02:30.976 --> 02:32.394
Oi vey!

02:32.478 --> 02:35.773
<i>Almost 300 acres
and several homes have burned,</i>

02:35.856 --> 02:39.860
<i>and with Santa Ana winds blowing strong
and tinder-dry conditions,</i>

02:39.944 --> 02:42.154
<i>this fire shows no signs of weakness.</i>

02:42.238 --> 02:45.824
They say arson is a sexual crime.

02:46.408 --> 02:48.494
Couldn't you have just rubbed one out?

02:48.577 --> 02:50.955
- You did this?
- Of course not.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.831
You took care of the bikers, didn't you?

02:52.915 --> 02:58.337
There are tinder-dry conditions out there,
warm temperatures, low rainfall,

02:58.420 --> 03:02.007
high-density housing in a natural habitat,
Santa Ana winds.

03:02.925 --> 03:04.426
Not my fault.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.720
- You're a gangster.
- Shut up.

03:06.804 --> 03:07.846
I'm proud of you.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.557
- Don't be.
- Don't be.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.978
Well, what's our next move?

03:14.061 --> 03:16.105
Don't even fucking say Pittsburgh, OK?

03:16.188 --> 03:18.691
We've had enough of that shit.
Just deal like the rest of us.

03:18.774 --> 03:20.192
- Pittsburgh.
- Dipshit.

03:20.276 --> 03:23.195
- Dad!
- OK, enough, everybody.

03:23.320 --> 03:28.200
Time to pack up. We're leaving.
Take only what's really important, OK?

03:28.951 --> 03:30.286
Everybody, go!

03:31.203 --> 03:33.789
<i>Fire-fighters continue
to lose ground in Majestic</i>

03:33.873 --> 03:36.208
<i>despite the efforts
of several local agencies.</i>

03:36.292 --> 03:37.877
<i>We take you there live for an update.</i>

03:37.918 --> 03:41.046
<i>Everything we couldn't get into the van
we wrapped in trash bags,</i>

03:41.130 --> 03:43.007
<i>which we sunk to the bottom of the pool.</i>

03:43.132 --> 03:45.593
<i>Because we figure the pool can't burn, right?</i>

03:45.676 --> 03:47.720
<i>Now we're just praying</i>

03:47.803 --> 03:50.431
<i>the water doesn't get into the bags
and destroy the Bowflex.</i>

03:50.514 --> 03:53.017
<i>I am sorry to interrupt.
We have just received word</i>

03:53.100 --> 03:56.395
<i>that the evacuation of
lower Majestic is now mandatory.</i>

03:56.478 --> 04:01.358
<i>I repeat, there is now a mandatory call
for evacuation in lower Majestic.</i>

04:01.442 --> 04:05.029
<i>Fire-fighters are going door-to-door
telling people to get out immediately</i>

04:05.112 --> 04:09.033
<i>as this insatiable conflagration
continues to rage.</i>

04:09.533 --> 04:12.494
Hello? Hello?

04:13.621 --> 04:16.916
Hello? Firemen?

04:17.750 --> 04:22.004
Hello? You're blocking my driveway.
I can't pull my car out.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.547
We can't move the truck now.

04:23.631 --> 04:27.676
We asked for a voluntary evacuation
of this area hours ago.

04:28.135 --> 04:33.432
Well, how am I supposed to evacuate with your
truck parked in front of my fucking driveway?

04:33.515 --> 04:37.811
There are shuttle buses running to
the evacuation centre every two blocks, ma'am.

04:37.895 --> 04:40.522
I just finished loading up the car.

04:40.606 --> 04:45.110
Come on, it'll take you two seconds,
and I'll be on my merry way.

04:46.570 --> 04:48.239
- Please?
- OK. Got it?

04:48.322 --> 04:51.617
<i>All residents are required
to leave their homes now.</i>

04:51.700 --> 04:55.663
<i>- This is a mandatory evacuation.
- You spiteful, fucking piece of shit.</i>

04:56.330 --> 04:59.500
What if this was your house?
All of your things.

04:59.583 --> 05:03.879
I live in a shitty apartment. My ex-wife has
all the good stuff, so I wouldn't give a shit.

05:03.963 --> 05:06.507
But you're welcome
that I'm risking my life and lungs

05:06.590 --> 05:10.302
trying to save your home,
your hybrid, and all your crap.

05:17.101 --> 05:20.187
You know what? Fair enough.

05:21.272 --> 05:23.774
You know, I don't need any of this.

05:24.358 --> 05:27.152
- I'm going to the shuttle!
- Good for you.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.662
Here's my phone number. Call me.

05:37.663 --> 05:41.083
A few drinks, some angry sex.

05:44.003 --> 05:45.421
Here I go.

05:49.842 --> 05:52.928
OK, we need to be leaving. I smell smoke.

05:53.012 --> 05:55.389
Damn, Heylia, you get nervous
around a barbecue.

05:55.472 --> 05:57.391
Just let me pack a few more plants.

05:57.474 --> 06:01.061
Look, we done most of what we can do.
House burns down, we start again.

06:01.145 --> 06:03.606
House still standing,
we go back to work in a few days.

06:03.689 --> 06:08.694
Oh, no. I'm getting too old for this shit.
Growing here and running there.

06:08.777 --> 06:10.863
Fuck it. I'm going legit.

06:13.073 --> 06:17.161
- Now what the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm opening up a club.

06:17.786 --> 06:19.705
Heylia's Compassionate Care.

06:20.206 --> 06:24.043
- What? I still got my connections.
- You gonna buy from me?

06:24.126 --> 06:26.253
So long as I don't know where you growing it,

06:26.337 --> 06:28.797
and I don't have to see your fucking girlfriend.

06:28.923 --> 06:31.008
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Fine.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.344
Your cock-charming fuck buddy.

06:33.928 --> 06:36.847
I'm done fighting it,
cos I know you gonna do what you gonna do.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.850
I'm simply asking
that you keep it out my face,

06:39.934 --> 06:43.896
and I hope she make a decent turkey cos
she ain't coming to my house for Thanksgiving.

06:46.232 --> 06:49.109
Now, look at that timing. There you go.

06:50.819 --> 06:54.406
<i>Residents in northern Majestic
have been ordered to evacuate</i>

06:54.448 --> 06:57.993
<i>and voluntary evacuations
are in effect for lower Majestic</i>

06:58.118 --> 07:01.539
<i>and the area formerly known as
Agrestic Township.</i>

07:01.622 --> 07:05.167
<i>All evacuees are welcome here to
the Summer Canyon Recreation Centre.</i>

07:05.251 --> 07:07.836
Dan, back to you in the studio.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.715
All right, that's it, guys.
Let's get back as soon as we can.

07:14.176 --> 07:17.429
Careful.
This is my dad, not a washing machine.

07:17.513 --> 07:19.598
- I'm fine, honey.
- No, you're not.

07:19.682 --> 07:21.892
You were banging around in there like a pinball.

07:21.976 --> 07:25.229
Were you trying to hit every pothole,
or do you just suck at your job?

07:25.312 --> 07:28.107
It's been a long night. She's tired, cranky.

07:28.190 --> 07:32.278
Dad, you need to stop being such a pussy.
I'm not always gonna be around.

07:32.528 --> 07:33.529
Here we go.

07:33.612 --> 07:35.072
I'm ready.

07:36.198 --> 07:38.325
- What's that?
- My turtles.

07:39.451 --> 07:41.912
- You have turtles?
- Franco and Warhol.

07:42.580 --> 07:46.667
- How long have you had turtles?
- I won them last year at a carnival.

07:46.750 --> 07:50.629
Turtles. How did I not know
you had turtles... for a year?

07:52.756 --> 07:55.426
No, honey. No waffle maker.
We don't need it.

07:55.509 --> 08:00.139
Homeowner's insurance policy,
deed to the house, birth certificates.

08:00.222 --> 08:04.184
- Daddy's earthquake box.
- He reminded me about it this morning.

08:05.269 --> 08:06.979
Well, tell him thanks.

08:08.022 --> 08:09.857
He doesn't want to leave the house, Mom.

08:09.940 --> 08:13.736
It's a good thing he can't catch fire,
but we can. Does he understand that?

08:13.819 --> 08:15.779
I'm not leaving if he's not leaving.

08:19.617 --> 08:24.747
- Shane, this has gone far enough, really.
- I'm not leaving.

08:29.752 --> 08:31.670
Judah? Listen...

08:34.798 --> 08:36.508
Judah, listen to me.

08:36.592 --> 08:40.179
No, it's my turn to talk.
Can I talk, please? Thank you.

08:41.679 --> 08:47.645
Kindly tell our son that he needs to leave,
because his safety is more important

08:47.728 --> 08:52.149
than hanging out with you
in this prefab shitbox you loved so well.

08:52.233 --> 08:54.401
You both need to let it go.

08:55.486 --> 08:58.322
No, my hair's the same.
OK, I stopped straightening it.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.908
All right, are you gonna tell him? Fine.

09:02.326 --> 09:03.577
Shane,

09:04.078 --> 09:06.330
your father wants you to go.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.752
I'll start loading the car.

09:11.835 --> 09:16.799
The evacuation centre, captive audience,
high anxiety level.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.426
Where there's smoke, there's smoke.

09:19.510 --> 09:22.555
We need to stop off
and get my seedlings at the grow house.

09:22.638 --> 09:25.599
- No.
- I'm not leaving without my work.

09:27.476 --> 09:31.188
Fine, I'll go and get it. You guys take the van
and go to the rec centre.

09:31.272 --> 09:33.607
I'll meet you there. Start loading.

09:38.028 --> 09:41.574
- Did you know Shane had turtles?
- Franco and Warhol.

09:41.657 --> 09:43.576
Right. Go.

09:43.659 --> 09:45.119
<i>Live at the scene here,</i>

09:45.202 --> 09:49.290
<i>mandatory evacuations of areas of Majestic...</i>

09:49.373 --> 09:52.376
Look at that!
It's right behind the golf course.

09:52.459 --> 09:57.131
OK, team, we're in a giant room
full of unhappy people with lots of cash.

09:57.214 --> 10:00.259
So, let's take their cash
and make them happy, OK?

10:00.342 --> 10:01.886
On my count. One, two, three.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.345
- Break!
- Break!

10:03.804 --> 10:06.932
<i># Where there's fire, people like to smoke</i>

10:06.974 --> 10:10.060
<i># Where there's fire, people like to toke</i>

10:10.144 --> 10:13.188
<i># Where there's fire, we can all get paid</i>

10:13.272 --> 10:16.525
<i># And if we're lucky, maybe we'll get laid</i>

10:17.776 --> 10:22.448
<i>We're live outside
the evacuation centre. The parking lot is full of...</i>

10:25.367 --> 10:27.494
- Your phone broken?
- Sorry about that.

10:27.578 --> 10:30.539
I was trying to get as much out
as I could before I lock up.

10:30.623 --> 10:34.293
It's nuts out there.
Couldn't even drive over here.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.713
I had to park
and sneak under the barricade.

10:37.796 --> 10:40.466
- Should you even be here?
- I was sent.

10:40.549 --> 10:43.302
Got to rescue the magical Silas strain.

10:44.428 --> 10:47.139
Plus, I hear there's a fire
barrelling towards this house.

10:47.223 --> 10:51.810
I was wondering if there's anything
I could take with me.

10:51.894 --> 10:55.272
Heylia took a bunch of it,
but grab what you can.

10:56.106 --> 10:57.775
Dole it out as slow as you can,

10:57.858 --> 11:00.277
because I think that's gonna be it for a while.

11:00.361 --> 11:02.947
- Wildfire.
- Guillermo fire.

11:03.822 --> 11:04.823
No shit?

11:04.907 --> 11:08.911
I don't think he meant for it to spread.
He was burning out the bikers.

11:08.994 --> 11:12.623
That's what happens
when you make a deal with the devil...

11:12.706 --> 11:13.958
fire.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.211
"Fire. Fire on the mountain. "

11:18.087 --> 11:19.088
Huh?

11:21.340 --> 11:23.175
Grateful Dead.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.348
Can you make a turkey?

11:29.431 --> 11:31.642
Can I make a turkey?
Where did that come from?

11:31.725 --> 11:34.103
Just answer the question.

11:34.186 --> 11:37.022
I can buy a turkey.

11:37.106 --> 11:40.776
Heylia makes these deep-fried turkeys.

11:43.362 --> 11:45.865
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

11:47.408 --> 11:52.246
Can't really see myself deep-frying.
I'm more of a bake and broil kind of girl.

11:54.707 --> 11:58.419
Microwaves. Think I could fit
a turkey in the microwave?

11:58.460 --> 12:00.671
You'd have to have a pretty big microwave.

12:00.754 --> 12:02.798
Or a pretty small turkey.

12:06.594 --> 12:08.012
Nancy.

12:09.597 --> 12:11.640
What are you gonna do

12:12.516 --> 12:14.393
if it all burns down?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.813
Your house, your suburb.

12:22.902 --> 12:24.194
Well...

12:26.322 --> 12:27.573
Well...

12:30.117 --> 12:31.535
I guess...

12:33.370 --> 12:35.331
I guess I'd have to go.

12:52.056 --> 12:53.432
Drink up.

12:54.391 --> 12:57.645
So, what's our next move, Nance?

12:58.062 --> 13:01.815
I thought I'd get some cheese.
They're making fondue at Cot 14.

13:01.899 --> 13:06.987
No, not that.
The business, our friend Mary Jane.

13:07.071 --> 13:10.366
Why don't we see how the fire goes
and then we can regroup?

13:10.449 --> 13:14.286
Well, don't forget that I am in the group
when we regroup.

13:14.370 --> 13:17.331
Fine. If we regroup the group,
you'll be in the group.

13:18.290 --> 13:21.710
- She's got a great ass, your mom.
- Don't be gross.

13:22.294 --> 13:24.088
I was just kidding.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.465
Isabelle,

13:27.633 --> 13:29.718
are you really a lesbian?

13:32.263 --> 13:34.723
Do you really talk to your dead father?

13:37.810 --> 13:40.771
- I got to go to the bathroom.
- Go.

13:42.815 --> 13:46.986
Agrestic... Shit, Majestic police!
Hello! Anyone here?

13:47.778 --> 13:51.740
Holy shit. Hello? Anyone here?

13:51.824 --> 13:55.494
You really got to clear out now.
The fire's up the block and it's moving fast.

13:55.578 --> 13:56.579
Holy shit.

13:56.662 --> 13:59.331
I think they shot Peckers of the Caribbean here.

13:59.415 --> 14:03.377
OK, the fire just took out the Olive Garden.
Come on, guys, we really got to go.

14:06.088 --> 14:08.465
Franco, like the Spanish dictator?

14:08.549 --> 14:12.469
Franco, like Franco Harris,
the Steelers hall of fame football player.

14:12.553 --> 14:15.139
Honey, I know where you're going with this.

14:15.222 --> 14:18.100
We are never going to move to Pittsburgh.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.395
Mommy hates the cold.

14:21.478 --> 14:24.273
If you still feel this strongly about it in five years,

14:24.398 --> 14:26.025
you can apply to Carnegie Mellon.

14:26.108 --> 14:30.404
"And he doth great wonders,
so that he maketh fire come from heaven... "

14:30.487 --> 14:33.949
- Creepy.
- What about Tampa?

14:38.120 --> 14:39.830
I got to go.

14:39.914 --> 14:43.542
"And men were scorched with great heat,
and blasphemed the name of God,

14:43.626 --> 14:45.878
"which hath power over these plagues. "

14:45.961 --> 14:47.463
- Amen!
- Amen!

14:47.546 --> 14:48.547
Stand up.

14:49.757 --> 14:52.801
Raise your hands high and pray for him!

14:56.472 --> 14:58.933
<i># Oh, the Jesus freaks are singing</i>

14:59.016 --> 15:01.227
<i># The Jesus freaks are singing</i>

15:01.727 --> 15:04.188
<i># The Jesus freaks are singing</i>

15:04.772 --> 15:07.399
<i># They're annoying, self-righteous and mean #</i>

15:16.825 --> 15:19.161
Everybody, come on. All together now.

15:21.956 --> 15:25.459
- So, it's not your house?
- No. No.

15:26.043 --> 15:31.423
That house belongs to Celia.
Celia Hodes. H-O-D-E-S.

15:31.590 --> 15:34.510
Then, why is it in the name
of a company that you own?

15:34.593 --> 15:38.055
Well, because my company bought it,
and then I gave it to Celia.

15:38.138 --> 15:42.685
Now, why would you give
this Celia person a house, Mr. Groff?

15:44.687 --> 15:48.274
Because she was my lover, and it was good.

15:49.525 --> 15:52.695
And she was getting a divorce,
and she wanted a house,

15:52.778 --> 15:57.491
but I couldn't put it in her name because
the divorce hadn't gone through yet.

15:57.575 --> 16:01.912
The power of passion makes you
do crazy things... Captain Till, is it?

16:01.996 --> 16:04.290
OK, so, you buy her a house,

16:05.666 --> 16:07.960
and I assume you're fucking her in said house,

16:08.043 --> 16:10.796
she of the magical house-earning pussy.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.132
Did you not notice the many marijuana plants

16:13.215 --> 16:14.925
that were growing in her living room?

16:15.009 --> 16:16.635
Well, we broke up a few weeks ago,

16:16.719 --> 16:19.763
so she must have started
growing it right after that.

16:20.389 --> 16:24.560
You know, it's funny. I would have never
pegged her as the drug-dealing type.

16:24.643 --> 16:26.437
She's a very complicated woman.

16:26.520 --> 16:31.567
Jesus, Groff, if I let you stick your finger
up my ass, can I get a Porsche?

16:33.611 --> 16:36.155
May I go now, Captain Till?
My work here is finished.

16:36.238 --> 16:40.868
I'm due in Colorado Springs in three days,
and it's time for me to hit the road.

16:40.993 --> 16:43.037
Leave a number where I can reach you.

16:44.121 --> 16:45.789
- Will do.
- Go.

17:00.054 --> 17:03.140
I just got a call from Guillermo,
and I need to go meet him.

17:03.224 --> 17:04.642
No.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.936
Nancy, no. Just stay here.

17:08.020 --> 17:11.732
Stay here with me and the kids.
Get your toes done, sell some weed.

17:11.815 --> 17:15.528
- I hear there's fondue at Cot 14.
- It was just a cheese plate.

17:16.737 --> 17:19.198
You need to stop hanging out with bad people.

17:19.281 --> 17:23.577
- The man set a town on fire.
- All the more reason not to piss him off.

17:23.661 --> 17:27.665
We just need to talk, Guillermo and me.
I'll be back soon.

17:27.748 --> 17:30.209
Do you have some sort of a plan?

17:32.503 --> 17:36.632
I'm working on it. Work in progress.
I got to get going.

17:37.716 --> 17:40.219
They found the cross! It's in a house in Majestic.

17:40.302 --> 17:42.096
We have to save it!

17:42.680 --> 17:44.932
- Majestic's on fire.
- Jesus will protect us.

17:45.015 --> 17:47.017
Jesus will protect us!

17:47.643 --> 17:50.396
- Jesus does not make you flame-retardant.
- I have to go.

17:50.479 --> 17:51.689
Hallelujah! Praise God!

17:54.358 --> 17:56.485
This was not what I had in mind.

17:56.569 --> 17:59.905
Act of God, baby. Fire's part of nature.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.157
Act of stupidity.

18:03.492 --> 18:05.578
Those are people's homes.

18:05.661 --> 18:08.581
FEMA's gonna set them up at the Marriott.

18:08.664 --> 18:13.252
They're gonna get room service
for two months, premium cable.

18:13.335 --> 18:18.966
Then they'll come back,
see it all built up bigger, brighter.

18:20.050 --> 18:23.304
And then God's gonna burn it down again,

18:23.387 --> 18:27.099
cos they don't belong here in the first place.

18:27.182 --> 18:29.977
And the whole thing starts over.

18:30.060 --> 18:33.314
- It's the circle of life.
- Hakuna matata.

18:33.397 --> 18:37.318
- My house is about to burn to the ground.
- You got insurance?

18:37.401 --> 18:39.320
My weed is about to burn to the ground.

18:39.403 --> 18:42.489
My customer base
is about to burn to the ground.

18:42.573 --> 18:44.867
For that, I don't have insurance.

18:44.950 --> 18:49.246
Couldn't get them to offer me
a drug-dealer loss-of-product policy.

18:49.288 --> 18:52.333
- Then, it's a sign.
- A sign?

18:52.958 --> 18:54.835
That it's time to move on.

18:55.502 --> 18:59.840
That you don't belong here.
This is not your home.

19:02.092 --> 19:05.095
- What happened to the bikers?
- They moving on, too.

19:05.930 --> 19:08.891
But I don't think
your paths are gonna cross.

19:09.099 --> 19:10.935
What am I gonna do?

19:12.728 --> 19:17.524
You're white. You're smart, pretty.

19:17.608 --> 19:23.197
Yeah, I'll think of something, huh?
Fuck you! That's my entire life. All that.

19:23.280 --> 19:28.827
Entire life. Come on. This is one tiny valley.

19:28.911 --> 19:31.664
Over the hill, there's another one just like it.

19:31.747 --> 19:34.792
Then another hill and another valley.

19:34.875 --> 19:39.672
And it goes like that, just over and over,
all the way south to Mexico.

19:42.508 --> 19:44.593
You're facing west.

19:46.095 --> 19:50.432
See, I could use you.
You tell me which way is south.

19:51.350 --> 19:54.144
- You be my navigator.
- Hand off the ass.

19:55.521 --> 19:58.023
And thank you for the muscle.

19:59.567 --> 20:03.946
Sorry I can't pay you. It's not my fault, is it?

20:04.530 --> 20:08.242
- I bring a lot of mota across the border.
- Yeah.

20:09.159 --> 20:12.496
I'm not selling for you.
I'm nobody's bitch anymore.

20:13.789 --> 20:17.710
We'd take you off the sales floor.
That's for the little people.

20:17.793 --> 20:19.253
Navigator.

20:20.379 --> 20:22.673
I get stuck in traffic a lot.

20:24.216 --> 20:25.885
Traffic?

20:25.968 --> 20:28.095
Which one is your house?

20:30.431 --> 20:31.807
That one.

20:32.892 --> 20:34.643
No, it's that one?

20:36.020 --> 20:38.731
I don't know. It's over there somewhere.

20:38.772 --> 20:40.608
Maybe the fire won't get there.

20:42.318 --> 20:44.403
You could stay here forever.

20:46.030 --> 20:47.323
Got to go.

20:54.830 --> 20:57.583
<i># Oh, this is just like the Superdome</i>

20:57.666 --> 21:00.586
<i># Except nowhere for piles of human waste</i>

21:00.628 --> 21:03.631
<i># It's still not quite like home
even though we got wi-fi</i>

21:03.756 --> 21:06.133
<i># Some cookies and toothpaste</i>

21:06.217 --> 21:08.928
<i># Yes, just like the Superdome</i>

21:09.011 --> 21:11.388
<i># Except everyone's white and middle class</i>

21:11.472 --> 21:14.558
<i># We got some yoga people chanting,
there's lot of Gatorade</i>

21:14.642 --> 21:17.394
<i># And toilet paper to wipe our ass</i>

21:17.478 --> 21:22.566
<i># This is just like the Superdome #</i>

21:22.650 --> 21:25.152
<i>We now go live to Majestic
for an update.</i>

21:25.236 --> 21:28.739
<i>- A group chanting "Jesus will protect us"...
- Check it out.</i>

21:28.822 --> 21:33.452
<i>...forced their way into the burning house
in an attempt to rescue the Majestic cross.</i>

21:33.536 --> 21:37.998
<i>Now those members are being treated in
hospital for minor burns and smoke inhalation.</i>

21:38.082 --> 21:41.418
<i>Can you tell us
why you ran into a burning house?</i>

21:41.502 --> 21:43.379
<i>The Lord told us to go.</i>

21:44.213 --> 21:46.006
OK, I'm over her.

21:46.090 --> 21:48.425
<i>Hodes? Celia Hodes?</i>

21:48.509 --> 21:52.429
<i>If Celia Hodes is in the room,
could you please raise your hand?</i>

21:52.513 --> 21:54.557
<i>Hodes? Celia Hodes?</i>

21:56.267 --> 21:59.687
I think they're calling you.
Is there some kind of raffle I didn't get in on?

21:59.770 --> 22:02.231
- I hate it when I miss out!
- I don't think so.

22:02.314 --> 22:04.525
Well, raise your hand. See what they want.

22:04.608 --> 22:06.986
Here! She's right here!

22:07.069 --> 22:09.071
- Celia Hodes?
- Yeah?

22:20.457 --> 22:22.042
Nancy Botwin.

22:31.719 --> 22:34.847
Sorry, ma'am.
This whole area's been evacuated.

22:34.930 --> 22:39.184
I know. I live here. I evacuated.
It's just my house is right there. Please?

22:39.268 --> 22:42.479
Ma'am, the fire's ripping
through the canyon behind your house.

22:42.563 --> 22:44.648
- It's not safe.
- I know. Look.

22:45.941 --> 22:50.905
My husband's ashes are in there.
Please, I forgot my husband's ashes.

22:50.988 --> 22:55.326
Let me go in there. My house is right there.
I'm begging you. Please.

22:56.202 --> 22:59.872
- You live right there?
- Yeah, that's my house right there.

23:00.372 --> 23:02.666
Two minutes. I'm counting. Go.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.891
<i># One gonna heal my body</i>

23:18.974 --> 23:21.060
<i># Another gonna heal my pain</i>

<i># One gonna settle me down</i>

24:14.864 --> 24:18.325
Andy, get the kids ready to go.
I'm coming back.

24:18.409 --> 24:20.536
It's time to hit the road.

24:20.911 --> 24:23.080
No, now, Andy! Do it!

24:24.874 --> 24:27.167
Well, then, don't make me yell.

24:27.918 --> 24:29.503
All right. See you soon.

24:38.929 --> 24:40.180
Judah,

24:41.307 --> 24:43.183
if you're still here,

24:44.602 --> 24:45.936
I tried.

25:20.554 --> 25:22.306
Oh, er...

25:22.389 --> 25:26.477
I forgot that we buried him.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.438
Thanks, though. Gotta go.
