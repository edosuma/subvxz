WEBVTT

00:01.426 --> 00:02.208
What's up, guys? I'm Paige.

00:02.244 --> 00:03.418
I'm Frankie.

00:03.453 --> 00:04.811
And we're Bizaardvark.

00:04.846 --> 00:07.473
Coming to you live
from my kitchen.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.817
We have exciting news. Tomorrow is our
first day of high school at Sierra High.

00:10.852 --> 00:13.729
- Go Terriers!
- (cheers and applause)

00:13.764 --> 00:15.029
- Dolphins?
- Whales?

00:15.065 --> 00:16.048
- Sheep.
- Sharks.

00:16.083 --> 00:17.198
- Rat.
- Fish.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.258
- Goose.
- Salmon.

00:18.293 --> 00:19.434
(both laughing)

00:19.469 --> 00:20.844
We should look that up.

00:20.879 --> 00:23.538
Anyways, our old school,
Hollander Prep,

00:23.574 --> 00:26.494
was a serious place, where everyone
only cared about learning and homework.

00:26.518 --> 00:29.611
Here's a highlight reel of all
our favorite moments there.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.616
- (high-pitched hum)
- Paige: Footage not available.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.866
- They also made us wear these horrible uniforms.
- (booing and jeering)

00:34.901 --> 00:36.092
Which we don't need anymore.

00:36.127 --> 00:37.138
- We don't have to wear this...
- Ow!

00:37.162 --> 00:38.653
I'm sorry!

00:38.689 --> 00:40.839
So, to honor
that fine institution,

00:40.875 --> 00:43.358
we're gonna fold them up,
and lay them to rest.

00:43.393 --> 00:45.702
Both: In a wood chipper!

00:45.738 --> 00:47.087
- I'm so excited!
- Ready?

00:47.122 --> 00:49.164
One, - Both: Two, three!

00:51.451 --> 00:55.070
That was the greatest thing
I've ever seen in my life!

00:55.105 --> 00:57.089
I wanna wood chip everything!

00:57.124 --> 00:59.215
Both: Eggs!

00:59.251 --> 01:00.500
Both: Scrambled eggs!

01:00.535 --> 01:01.535
Pillows!

01:03.705 --> 01:04.805
Both: Scrambled pillows!

01:04.840 --> 01:05.840
Both: Paint!

01:07.476 --> 01:09.267
Huh. We just made
beautiful abstract art.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.822
Both: Abstract art!

01:13.857 --> 01:15.232
Our birth certificates!

01:18.837 --> 01:20.094
Now we're no one.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.313
(clap of thunder)

01:21.348 --> 01:23.164
Both: Glitter!

01:23.199 --> 01:24.199
Both: Still glitter!

01:24.226 --> 01:25.191
Both: Bernie!

01:25.226 --> 01:27.118
Really?

01:27.154 --> 01:29.320
Sorry. Heat of the moment.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.036
Honestly, I'm just happy
you thought of me.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.662

02:32.343 --> 02:34.477
It's nothing like
our stuffy old school!

02:34.513 --> 02:36.905
I know, everything is so normal.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.316
Normal clothes. Normal lockers.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.785
Normal jerks!

02:42.821 --> 02:45.155
(both laugh)

02:45.190 --> 02:49.042
Hey, everyone! Can I have
your attensh for a mome?

02:49.077 --> 02:51.477
I'm Principal Karen.
But don't think of me

02:51.513 --> 02:53.229
as your principal.

02:53.264 --> 02:54.714
Think of me as your friend!

02:54.750 --> 02:56.708
Ha! What up!

03:00.564 --> 03:03.115
(sneezes) Ooh!

03:03.150 --> 03:05.525
Your schedules are available
in the cafeteria.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.910
Have a great first day,
and feel free to swing by

03:07.946 --> 03:09.696
my oficina anytime.

03:09.732 --> 03:12.148
I've got four bars of WiFi
up in there.

03:12.184 --> 03:14.201
Okay? (Laughs)

03:14.236 --> 03:16.745
Hello, Sierra High!

03:16.780 --> 03:20.106
(cheering)

03:24.146 --> 03:25.487
- Swish!
- (cheering)

03:29.175 --> 03:30.283
- Ham swish!
- (cheering)

03:35.423 --> 03:36.973
(cheering)

03:37.008 --> 03:39.234
(applause)

03:39.269 --> 03:41.169
- Welcome back, Dirk.
- What up, P.K.?

03:43.865 --> 03:46.849
Ssss!

03:46.885 --> 03:50.145
Even though you've graduated, you
will always be my favorite student.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.547
And, good news.
We saved your old locker.

03:52.582 --> 03:54.432
Sweet!

03:56.829 --> 04:01.431
My school chainsaw!

04:01.466 --> 04:05.435
Also, you know that dare you do every
year, where you grease yourself up

04:05.471 --> 04:07.887
and slide head first from
the cafeteria to the gym?

04:07.923 --> 04:12.834
<i>The Tarzana Times</i> called it,
"dangerous and unnecessary."

04:12.870 --> 04:15.770
Okay, don't be mad at me. But we
had to build some new classrooms,

04:15.806 --> 04:19.449
and so now there's a wall between
the cafeteria and the gym.

04:19.484 --> 04:21.529
"I forgive you, Principal Karen, wanna go
to a party?" (laughs) I'd love to, Dirk,

04:21.553 --> 04:23.620
I'm sorry we fought.

04:23.655 --> 04:26.957
It's cool.
I'll figure out the dare.

04:26.992 --> 04:28.791
You don't graduate
from Sierra High

04:28.827 --> 04:30.947
without learning a thing or
two about problem solving!

04:38.195 --> 04:40.061
Well... that's in there forever.

04:42.891 --> 04:46.702
This can't be right. We don't have any
classes together, not even lunch?

04:46.778 --> 04:49.596
- How are we gonna survive?
- (laughs) Paige, relax.

04:49.631 --> 04:52.807
This isn't our old school.
We're gonna fit in great here.

04:52.843 --> 04:55.744
And at the end of the day, we'll
catch up on everything we missed.

04:55.779 --> 04:56.694
We can do this.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.330
Yeah.

04:58.365 --> 05:04.076
(laughs) Oh, no. I have a
teacher named Mr. Fartelli.

05:04.112 --> 05:05.929
How am I not gonna laugh
when I say his name?

05:05.931 --> 05:08.506
Paige? We're in high school
now? Okay, be mature.

05:10.927 --> 05:12.218
You're right. I'm sorry.

05:15.823 --> 05:18.791
- (fart noises)
- (laughing)

05:18.826 --> 05:19.906
- Love you.
- Love you more.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.981
Maya Sanderson?

05:25.016 --> 05:27.683
(to himself) <i>Okay, Bernie.
First day at a new school.</i>

05:27.719 --> 05:30.436
<i>Nobody knows you here.
You can erase the past</i>

05:30.472 --> 05:33.222
<i>and make a perfect
first impression.</i>

05:33.258 --> 05:35.917
<i>Just listen for your name and
then confidently say "Here."</i>

05:35.952 --> 05:37.494
- Bernie Schotz?
- Rear!

05:40.448 --> 05:43.500
Uh, sitting on my rear.
I love butts!

05:46.563 --> 05:48.505
<i>Just stop, it's over.
You're Butt Guy.</i>

05:51.802 --> 05:54.761
Introducin' the one and only,
Amelia Duckworth.

05:56.915 --> 06:00.241
Young lady... that is not
how we enter my classroom.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.559
You're right. I'm so sorry.

06:06.792 --> 06:08.441
<i>♪</i>

06:08.477 --> 06:12.203
<i>♪ Amelia, Amelia ♪</i>

06:12.238 --> 06:13.488
<i>♪ I'm kinda super famous ♪</i>

06:15.441 --> 06:19.260
Hey! You're Amelia
from<i> Perfect Perfection!</i>

06:19.296 --> 06:22.122
Hey! I'm Mr. Hattleberg
from I Don't Care, Iowa.

06:27.245 --> 06:30.071
Take a seat. -(Gasps) Ooh,
I'll take this big one!

06:30.107 --> 06:31.631
With the students.

06:31.666 --> 06:32.674
Ew.

06:35.787 --> 06:39.488
Sorry. I've never been in a
classroom with other kids before.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.508
I've been homeschooled
my whole life.

06:41.543 --> 06:45.771
But I promise
I know how to behave.

06:45.806 --> 06:49.399
- Mr. Hattleberg, I have a question about...
- Hey Ameliacs, I'm comin' to you

06:49.434 --> 06:52.569
live from my first day
of public school.

06:52.604 --> 06:55.179
It's already goin' great,
and everybody loves me!

06:55.215 --> 06:58.783
The only thing missin' is a light dusting
of my Purposely Perfect perfume!

07:01.504 --> 07:05.781
(students coughing)

07:05.817 --> 07:07.897
Now seems like a good time
to put on a movie. (Sighs)

07:10.747 --> 07:13.022
(to himself) <i>Okay, Bernie.
Second chance.</i>

07:13.057 --> 07:15.491
<i>Amelia took all of the
attention off of you.</i>

07:15.527 --> 07:18.135
<i>Just don't associate with her
and you're in the clear.</i>

07:18.171 --> 07:19.679
I'm gonna marry that girl!

07:22.693 --> 07:24.700
- (school bell ringing)
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

07:24.736 --> 07:27.770
Aw! Come on, I was only
like five seconds late!

07:36.940 --> 07:38.031
Aah!

07:41.419 --> 07:42.702
Lockers, am I right?

07:45.957 --> 07:49.842
Please pair up and find your
lab partner for the year.

07:49.878 --> 07:53.630
Hey, do you...? Oh. Uh, huh... Hey.
Do you wanna be... Oh.

07:53.665 --> 07:56.098
You're with him. He looks smart.
Good for you.

07:56.134 --> 07:58.468
Um... ah...

08:00.564 --> 08:02.455
Somebody gets to be
partners with the teacher.

08:02.491 --> 08:04.032
Awkward.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.067
(students laughing)

08:06.520 --> 08:09.095
Whoa. A laugh.

08:09.130 --> 08:11.548
That felt good.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.543
Looks like I'll be picking
on you a lot this year.

08:16.312 --> 08:17.737
Aah!

08:19.416 --> 08:21.241
Whose side are you on, locker?

08:25.012 --> 08:28.156
Oh, hey, is that seat...? Oh.

08:28.191 --> 08:30.625
Hey, do you mind if I...? Saved.

08:35.531 --> 08:37.048
And, I'll stand.

08:44.833 --> 08:46.993
And, I'll clean up my food
while everyone stares at me.

08:49.897 --> 08:53.573
(to himself) <i>Okay, Dirk, this wall
is the only thing stopping you</i>

08:53.608 --> 08:55.216
<i>from sliding from the cafeteria</i>

08:55.251 --> 08:57.134
<i>to the gym. But you're smart.</i>

08:57.170 --> 09:00.596
<i>You can think of a super clever
way to solve this problem.</i>

09:00.631 --> 09:03.024
Hey, wall! Look over there!

09:03.059 --> 09:04.284
(thud)

09:04.319 --> 09:06.286
Oh! Ohh! Ohh!

09:08.423 --> 09:10.415
<i>Your toe hurts
because you kicked a wall.</i>

09:12.461 --> 09:14.327
Waaaaaaaah!

09:14.362 --> 09:15.795
(thud)

09:19.367 --> 09:20.550
(thud)

09:20.585 --> 09:21.718
Aah!

09:24.481 --> 09:25.881
I'll put that
in the "maybe" column.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.554
- Paige! Finally!
- Hey! I've been dying to talk to you!

09:33.590 --> 09:37.283
Me too. This day has been...
unbelievable.

09:37.318 --> 09:39.694
I know, I love it here!

09:39.729 --> 09:42.272
People are so friendly, I've
met all these cool new people.

09:42.307 --> 09:46.226
Really?
Uh, that's... that's great.

09:46.261 --> 09:49.779
Oh, and Mr. Fartelli?
That guy's an inspiration.

09:49.814 --> 09:55.335
He told me I could do anything, and for the
first time in my life... I believed it.

09:55.370 --> 09:58.404
Wow. Yeah, that... um,
that sounds like Mr. Hattleberg.

09:58.439 --> 10:01.341
He told me to sit down,
and I... I did.

10:03.069 --> 10:06.003
Can you believe we thought we
weren't gonna fit in at this place?

10:06.039 --> 10:09.324
- What did we think we were, losers?
- Losers! (Laughs)

10:09.359 --> 10:11.584
No, not these girls!

10:11.620 --> 10:14.106
So, what else? I wanna hear all
about your day, tell me everything.

10:14.130 --> 10:16.263
Leave out nothing.

10:16.299 --> 10:19.367
<i>Come on!
I was only five seconds late!</i>

10:19.403 --> 10:20.968
<i>Awkward.</i>

10:21.004 --> 10:22.511
<i>Ohh!</i>

10:22.547 --> 10:23.696
(crash)

10:24.891 --> 10:29.260
It was great. Everything was great.
I had... I had

10:29.295 --> 10:30.245
a perfect first day.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.121
- Yay!
- Ha!

10:32.156 --> 10:33.676
- I'm so proud of us. I'll call you later.
- Cool.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.008
I'll just... I'll be here.

10:36.043 --> 10:38.545
Totally loving school!

10:38.580 --> 10:41.756
Ohh!

10:41.791 --> 10:44.150
Did I hear someone say
they're totally loving school?

10:44.185 --> 10:45.718
I am doin' the job!

10:58.708 --> 11:00.741
Hey, Sofie, can you
grab that for me?

11:00.777 --> 11:01.777
Sure thing.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.275
(horn honking)

11:13.623 --> 11:15.832
Okay, I feel like
you're just showing off.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.875
Please. If I was showing
off, I woulda done this...

11:28.388 --> 11:30.154
Free candy!

11:30.189 --> 11:32.064
(cheering)

11:32.099 --> 11:33.700
(festive music playing)

11:33.735 --> 11:34.892
Foot five!

11:43.861 --> 11:46.862
Take that, wall! Ahhhh!

11:46.897 --> 11:50.074
Hm. Doesn't work
when I'm small, either.

11:51.853 --> 11:53.528
Hey, Dirk. You got a sec?

11:53.563 --> 11:55.454
Yeah, sure. What's up?

11:55.490 --> 11:56.742
You're a legend
at school, right?

11:56.766 --> 11:58.758
M... Maybe you can
give me some advice?

11:58.793 --> 12:01.494
Totally. You have
my full attention.

12:01.529 --> 12:04.505
Great.
So, um... here's the thing.

12:06.876 --> 12:08.860
My first day at school
has been terrible.

12:08.895 --> 12:12.888
I feel like no one likes me, I never
see Paige, and all these crows

12:12.924 --> 12:15.841
have been staring at me.

12:15.876 --> 12:18.276
That's not really a school
problem, but it's freakin' me out.

12:19.897 --> 12:21.463
Maybe if you had a car.

12:21.499 --> 12:23.274
Sure, but I'm 14.

12:25.111 --> 12:29.121
I just feel lost. And I...
I don't wanna tell Paige

12:29.157 --> 12:30.935
what I'm going through 'cause
she's having so much fun.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.659
Who built this wall?

12:33.694 --> 12:35.870
Well, I... I guess,
metaphorically, I did.

12:39.475 --> 12:42.009
Wow, Dirk,
you're a really deep guy.

12:42.045 --> 12:44.281
(as Bigfoot) Don't worry Dirk.
Bigfoot's here to help you.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.981
Smash! Smash! Smash!

12:47.017 --> 12:48.417
Dirk, were you even
listening to me?

12:50.920 --> 12:53.930
(whirring noise)

12:58.019 --> 13:01.921
That's it! I'll strap five
leaf blowers to my back,

13:01.956 --> 13:05.066
fill them with nitro fuel,
and then blast through the wall!

13:05.101 --> 13:06.901
Frankie! You just solved
both of our problems!

13:09.105 --> 13:11.489
What? No! We just solved yours!

13:13.510 --> 13:14.510
What just happened?

13:20.975 --> 13:23.303
(to herself) <i>All right, Amelia.
You've been at school two days.</i>

13:23.327 --> 13:26.178
<i>Time to make
your first new friend.</i>

13:26.214 --> 13:29.132
(imitating Amelia) I'm perfectly annoyin'.
Spritz, spritz.

13:29.167 --> 13:30.141
Spritz, spritz.

13:30.176 --> 13:34.546
(laughs) Wow. I don't know
who you're impersonatin',

13:34.581 --> 13:36.556
but that person sounds terrible!

13:40.020 --> 13:41.020
Oh.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.438
Is it you?

13:48.478 --> 13:49.478
Oh.

13:54.809 --> 13:56.153
(to herself)
<i>It can't be that hard to fit i.</i>

13:56.177 --> 13:57.654
<i>I mean, what is Paige doing
that I'm not?</i>

13:57.678 --> 14:00.646
My mom burned the pot roast.

14:00.681 --> 14:03.716
- So, pizza again! (Laughs)
- (others laughing)

14:03.793 --> 14:06.093
<i>Oh, okay, tell a story
about your family.</i>

14:06.128 --> 14:08.296
<i>Everyone can relate to that.</i>

14:08.331 --> 14:12.049
And my Aunt Helen burned the
house down, so... prison again!

14:17.081 --> 14:21.133
Oh my gosh, twinsies... (screams)

14:21.169 --> 14:23.118
<i>Oh, okay. Find common
ground with someone,</i>

14:23.154 --> 14:25.379
<i>and react with excitement.</i>

14:25.414 --> 14:27.415
Hey! We both have backpacks!

14:27.450 --> 14:29.609
(screams)

14:33.189 --> 14:35.656
Check me out, I'm a balloon man

14:35.691 --> 14:37.677
at a car dealership, tryin' to
get the teacher's attention.

14:37.701 --> 14:40.361
Call on me! Oh, shoot.

14:40.396 --> 14:44.098
Call on me! Oh, shoot.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.700
- (students laughing)
- <i>Duh, make people laugh.</i>

14:46.736 --> 14:49.178
<i>Why didn't I think of that
in the first place?</i>

14:49.213 --> 14:50.938
Hey! Everyone! Check it out!

14:50.974 --> 14:53.683
I'm a mummy
taking its driver's test!

14:53.718 --> 14:55.318
- I hope it's a green light...
- (grunts)

14:55.862 --> 14:57.178
(grunts)

15:00.008 --> 15:01.008
Dude! What's your deal?

15:03.886 --> 15:06.479
I'm so sorry, I didn't...
I didn't mean...

15:12.937 --> 15:15.096
Whoa! Whoa!
Frankie, are you okay?

15:15.131 --> 15:16.891
Not everyone fits in here
like you do, Paige.

15:21.346 --> 15:24.163
Did you hear? They're giving away
free spaghetti in the cafeteria!

15:31.564 --> 15:32.997
Frankie... what's going on?

15:33.033 --> 15:38.744
Paige, I'm sorry. Okay, I...
I'm sorry I blew up at you.

15:38.779 --> 15:40.939
It's just this week
has been so crazy.

15:41.015 --> 15:43.055
I... I keep trying to fit in,
but nothing's working.

15:44.501 --> 15:45.593
What?

15:45.628 --> 15:47.770
(sigh)

15:47.805 --> 15:49.885
I had no idea, y... you said
you were loving it here.

15:50.858 --> 15:52.241
Why didn't you tell me?

15:52.276 --> 15:54.018
I was too embarrassed.

15:54.053 --> 15:58.289
Like, at Hollander Prep I didn't care
that we didn't fit in because I knew

15:58.324 --> 15:59.568
those academic kids
were wrong about us.

15:59.592 --> 16:04.203
And then we came here, and I saw how
easy it was for you to make friends,

16:04.238 --> 16:06.396
and now I finally realize
what the problem was...

16:06.432 --> 16:09.108
it's me.

16:09.143 --> 16:11.919
Hey, don't talk about
my best friend like that.

16:14.457 --> 16:16.499
There's nothing wrong with you.

16:16.534 --> 16:19.335
It doesn't seem like that.

16:19.370 --> 16:21.281
(sigh) Feels like I need to change
every single thing about me

16:21.305 --> 16:22.855
to fit in here. (Sigh)

16:22.890 --> 16:25.850
Whoa. We need to talk this out.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.269
Step into my office.

16:29.305 --> 16:30.896
What, you got an office?

16:30.932 --> 16:32.481
How good was your week?

16:34.752 --> 16:36.027
I meant the stairs.

16:39.023 --> 16:40.815
Good thing
I wore my cargo pants,

16:40.850 --> 16:42.992
these are
very meatball friendly.

16:46.014 --> 16:47.755
Amelia?

16:47.791 --> 16:48.956
Are you okay?

16:50.751 --> 16:52.585
Nobody likes me here.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.217
Frankie, I get
what you're going through.

17:00.252 --> 17:03.104
But that doesn't mean you
need to change who you are.

17:03.139 --> 17:04.659
I think you need
to change who you are.

17:07.268 --> 17:10.227
Remember that time we met
at that crazy music class?

17:10.262 --> 17:12.997
As soon as I saw you,
I knew you were cool.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.483
I knew you were flawed,
like, right off the bat!

17:17.704 --> 17:20.521
You were funny, and original.

17:20.557 --> 17:22.782
And selfish, and arrogant,
and condescending, and...

17:25.035 --> 17:27.419
You gave me confidence.

17:27.455 --> 17:30.581
- You said...
- I was the size of a pea with the eyes of a rat.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.994
I feel so lucky to know you.

17:36.030 --> 17:37.357
You know, some nights
I write in my journal...

17:37.381 --> 17:39.390
"Why do you talk to this girl?"

17:39.425 --> 17:41.342
And then I'm like,
"Oh, 'cause she's hot."

17:43.871 --> 17:46.931
And that's why
you're my best friend.

17:46.966 --> 17:51.368
That's literally the only
reason we still hang out.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.604
Like, if you weren't pretty...

17:55.116 --> 17:57.299
Think about our first week
at Vuuugle.

17:57.335 --> 18:00.936
We freaked out and thought that
there was something wrong with us.

18:00.972 --> 18:03.672
Then we met people
who like us for who we are.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.392
And the same thing
is gonna happen here.

18:06.427 --> 18:07.285
You just gotta give it time.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.019
A lot of time.

18:09.055 --> 18:12.164
You're gonna need it to make these
drastic personality changes.

18:14.368 --> 18:15.368
Wow!

18:18.072 --> 18:21.398
Look, Amelia, I know there's a
sweet, sensitive girl in there,

18:21.434 --> 18:23.274
and with a little work,
other people will, too.

18:25.763 --> 18:28.697
You know what, Bernie?

18:28.732 --> 18:32.001
When I listened to you just now
and looked into your deep, black,

18:32.036 --> 18:36.422
rat eyes, I realized
you're right.

18:36.457 --> 18:40.476
I do have a lot to work on
and, from this day forward,

18:40.511 --> 18:42.528
I'll work on being
a better person.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.941
Thank you.

18:47.976 --> 18:51.028
(to himself) <i>Okay, Bernie. All
you need to do is nothing.</i>

18:51.063 --> 18:53.472
<i>She said, "Thank you."</i>

18:53.507 --> 18:54.507
(screams)

18:58.545 --> 18:59.545
She thought about it.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.391
Thanks. I feel a lot better.

19:04.426 --> 19:06.510
I just... I got so overwhelmed.

19:06.545 --> 19:09.605
Hey, next time you're having a
hard time, don't be embarrassed.

19:09.641 --> 19:11.732
Just tell me.

19:11.767 --> 19:14.135
I'm always gonna
be here for you.

19:14.170 --> 19:15.570
Oh, hey, I wanna
show you something.

19:21.302 --> 19:23.994
You got me an "and" symbol?

19:24.029 --> 19:25.237
- Open your locker.
- (laughs)

19:28.951 --> 19:32.377
Aww, poops and farts.

19:32.413 --> 19:34.533
Paige and Frankie. -(Laughs) I know.
I know, I know.

19:36.083 --> 19:36.898
- Love you.
- I love you more.

19:36.934 --> 19:37.934
(laughs)

19:39.971 --> 19:42.546
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask you this all week,

19:42.582 --> 19:44.656
but, are you guys Bizaardvark?

19:44.691 --> 19:46.133
- (laughs)
- Yeah, we are!

19:46.169 --> 19:47.910
- I'm... I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

19:47.945 --> 19:50.004
I told you, I told you,
I told you!

19:50.039 --> 19:52.631
I'm Claire.
You guys are hilarious.

19:52.666 --> 19:54.500
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

19:54.535 --> 19:55.910
Do you wanna hang out
after school?

19:55.945 --> 19:57.144
We're getting froyo.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.147
That sounds awesome.

20:03.026 --> 20:04.377
Dirk's doing the dare!

20:04.412 --> 20:07.288
He's doing the dare!

20:07.365 --> 20:10.032
Everybody, post pics,
and make sure you tag me!

20:13.387 --> 20:15.120
Thanks for coming, everybody!

20:15.156 --> 20:18.632
And thank you to Principal Karen

20:18.667 --> 20:23.220
for letting the entire school skip class
to watch me blast through that wall!

20:23.255 --> 20:26.656
(cheering and applause)

20:26.692 --> 20:28.592
I'm cool!

20:31.947 --> 20:34.531
I've got five leaf blowers
strapped to my back,

20:34.567 --> 20:36.516
and a tank full of nitro fuel.

20:36.552 --> 20:38.569
Let's fire up the engines!

20:38.604 --> 20:41.413
(cheering and applause)

20:41.448 --> 20:43.448
Fire one!

20:43.484 --> 20:44.667
(heavy wind)

20:44.702 --> 20:45.784
Fire two!

20:45.820 --> 20:47.494
(heavy wind)

20:47.530 --> 20:48.530
Fire three!

20:54.094 --> 20:57.662
Hey, Sierra High,
what do you say?

20:57.698 --> 20:58.698
Students: Here we go!

21:02.687 --> 21:04.920
(crash)

21:04.956 --> 21:06.013
Dirk: Dare completed!

21:06.048 --> 21:07.931
(cheering and applause)

21:07.967 --> 21:09.791
Yeah, yeah!

21:09.826 --> 21:11.234
(crash)

21:11.270 --> 21:12.553
Dirk: Okay! I'm outside now!

21:14.557 --> 21:16.882
Dirkie, no!

21:16.918 --> 21:19.668
Dirk: Uh-oh, I'm headed
back towards the school!

21:19.703 --> 21:22.021
- Uh...
- Principal Karen?

21:22.056 --> 21:24.056
I wouldn't stand there.
Pretty obvious you're gonna

21:24.083 --> 21:25.875
get destroyed
when he comes back...

21:25.910 --> 21:27.042
- (crash)
- Ohhhhh!

21:27.077 --> 21:28.527
All: Ohhhhhhhhhh!

21:30.723 --> 21:35.551
Hey, guys! Bizaardvark here
with some back-to-school tips.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.755
Do you ever find that your long
hair gets caught in your locker?

21:37.779 --> 21:39.864
Probably not 'cause
that's really specific.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.239
Well, don't worry,
'cause there's

21:41.275 --> 21:43.300
a hot new product
out there just for you.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.369
It's called a haircut.

21:45.404 --> 21:48.222
Whoa! How did this happen?

21:48.257 --> 21:51.133
- Editing.
- Way to ruin the magic, Paige.

21:51.168 --> 21:52.320
Check out all the
new looks I can do.

21:52.344 --> 21:54.628
Surprised hair... what?

21:54.663 --> 21:56.530
Tacos?

21:56.566 --> 21:58.498
Horror movie hair...
don't go in there!

21:58.533 --> 22:02.069
The killer's in there! Nooo!

22:02.104 --> 22:04.213
Abraham Lincoln hair!

22:04.248 --> 22:06.010
(patriotic music) - Four
score and seven years ago...

22:06.034 --> 22:08.450
- Paige's hair! Oh, no...
- All r... All right,

22:08.485 --> 22:11.086
that bit's over.
Time to show everybody

22:11.121 --> 22:13.539
Bizaardvark's newest video
