00:04.752 --> 00:06.019

00:06.020 --> 00:08.021
And you're
about to need adjusting!

[Roaring]

00:09.089 --> 00:10.657
What in the hell was that?

00:10.658 --> 00:13.693
[Magnus]: How does he manage
to fly like that without wings?

00:13.693 --> 00:15.461
I've never seen an abnormal
with that ability before.

00:15.462 --> 00:16.996
That is Walter's suit.

00:16.997 --> 00:18.698
Walter's suit is made of bugs?

00:18.699 --> 00:20.767
Walter isn't an abnormal,
he's wearing one.

00:20.768 --> 00:22.936
[Walter]: I must have
slipped down into a sinkhole

00:22.937 --> 00:24.404
or something,

00:24.405 --> 00:25.705
because
the next thing I know,

00:25.706 --> 00:27.440
I woke up in a cave
covered in slime.

00:27.441 --> 00:28.641
The suit's
living off you

00:28.642 --> 00:30.076
in exchange for
giving you these powers.

00:30.077 --> 00:31.444
You don't understand.

00:31.445 --> 00:33.112
I can't
take it off.

00:33.113 --> 00:34.080
It's stuck.

00:34.081 --> 00:35.048
Whoa!

00:35.049 --> 00:36.182
Uh, it's leaving.

00:37.751 --> 00:39.152
For the first time
since I got it,

00:39.153 --> 00:40.119
I truly wanted it off.

I'll miss you, little buddy.

Normandy, 1944.

00:46.927 --> 00:48.061
Allied invasion.

00:48.062 --> 00:49.996
You were on French soil
when it happened.

00:49.997 --> 00:51.831
Do you have that
inventory I asked for?

00:51.832 --> 00:52.999
A-ha.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.167
Sorry, Hank.

00:54.168 --> 00:55.001
What do you mean,
"a-ha"?

00:55.002 --> 00:55.969
That wasn't
a denial.

00:55.970 --> 00:57.103
She didn't
say "false",

00:57.104 --> 00:58.471
she asked you
for your homework.

00:58.472 --> 00:59.372
The weapons inventory
you promised me a week ago.

00:59.373 --> 01:00.473
Do you have it?

01:00.474 --> 01:02.308
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:02.309 --> 01:04.444
Yes, I know
I asked for the job,

01:04.444 --> 01:05.879
and I will get it to you.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.313
Henry can do it
if you're too busy.

01:07.314 --> 01:09.048
I will get it done.

01:09.049 --> 01:11.517
All right, pay up.
I won the bet.

01:11.518 --> 01:13.453
A Hitler youth knife
and a vintage Luger

01:13.454 --> 01:15.121
are not evidence
that she was in France

01:15.122 --> 01:16.289

01:16.290 --> 01:17.490
Yeah, they are

a ranking Gestapo Agent

understand.

01:27.768 --> 01:29.102
So, is it true?

01:29.103 --> 01:31.771
Were you part of
the invasion in 1944?

02:13.480 --> 02:14.480
Any idea what caused it?

02:14.481 --> 02:15.448
It's hard to say.

what could have caused it.

I don't know,

06:04.882 --> 06:06.249
Walter's suit was

was because the environmental

get the idea

08:47.344 --> 08:49.245
for all of this?

08:51.415 --> 08:52.815
Can you keep a secret?

08:52.816 --> 08:54.817
Yeah.

08:56.553 --> 08:58.454
I swear,

08:58.455 --> 09:01.357
I thought she was
from the studio.

09:01.358 --> 09:03.726
What happened
to her?

09:03.727 --> 09:04.927
I never saw her again.

09:06.263 --> 09:07.930
I really screwed up, didn't I?

[Gasps]

[Grunting with effort]

Don't bother.

09:25.716 --> 09:26.916
It's a reinforced
titanium alloy.

09:26.917 --> 09:28.718
Completely suitproof.

09:28.719 --> 09:30.453
Where the hell am I?

09:30.454 --> 09:32.521
Just relax.
You're in no danger.

09:33.690 --> 09:34.890
What is that?

09:34.891 --> 09:36.392
Dopamine inhibitor.

09:36.393 --> 09:37.693
It'll help with
the extraction process.

No, get that thing
away from me.

a slight pinch

So where does that
leave us?

At a dead end,
I'm afraid.

10:34.751 --> 10:36.285
[Will]:
Not necessarily.

10:36.286 --> 10:38.954
I think I solved the problem
of the environmental alarm.

10:38.955 --> 10:41.490
Henry's diagnostics
found a built-in protocol

10:41.491 --> 10:43.692

It was remotely

at the precise moment
our alarm went off.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.531

10:48.532 --> 10:49.565
Well, who would have
that kind of control?

10:49.566 --> 10:51.433
Well, somebody else
did a little digging

10:51.434 --> 10:52.868
in the FBI database.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.303

know them?

call him?

could overcome it.

in all of this?

find anything

to the attacks,

of payments they made

Now, Vorotech
is completely private,

experimental things.

15:54.027 --> 15:55.661

15:55.662 --> 15:56.996
So he used his connection
at Inverset

15:56.997 --> 15:57.997
to set off
our environmental alarms.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.598

to the main office.

17:39.833 --> 17:42.234
Just my luck.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.208
I hate that guy.

17:50.977 --> 17:53.345
[Beeping]

17:53.346 --> 17:56.148
Come on.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.333
Hi, handsome.

18:21.207 --> 18:22.074
[Chuckles]

18:23.643 --> 18:25.844
Oh, I like this.

18:33.253 --> 18:34.987
Magnus, come in.

18:34.988 --> 18:35.854
Go ahead.

18:35.855 --> 18:36.855
<i>Receiving chatter.</i>

18:36.856 --> 18:38.190
<i>Massive power surge</i>

18:38.191 --> 18:39.825
<i>at the warehouse</i>
<i>headed to.</i>

18:39.826 --> 18:40.826
Copy that.

18:40.827 --> 18:41.827
Just arriving
there now.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.233
Is that... the suit?

18:48.234 --> 18:49.301
Kate, thank God!

18:49.302 --> 18:51.770
Come with us,
quickly.

18:51.771 --> 18:53.172
[Laughs] Hell no.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.909
I'm just getting started.

19:04.918 --> 19:06.084
Sweet.

19:24.343 --> 19:25.644
What the hell was that?

19:25.645 --> 19:27.679
Why was she wearing the suit?

19:27.680 --> 19:30.182
It must have slipped
onto her at some point.

19:30.183 --> 19:31.483
Probably looking for
safe harbor.

19:31.484 --> 19:33.552
It went for somebody
it already knew.

19:33.553 --> 19:34.853
We have to get
after her.

19:38.291 --> 19:39.624
Dammit!

19:39.625 --> 19:41.693
Come on!

19:41.694 --> 19:44.262
[Sighs heavily]

19:44.263 --> 19:45.597
Hey, Magnus.

19:45.598 --> 19:49.568
First we need to see
what we're getting into.

19:50.937 --> 19:52.337
I'll call in
our available operatives,

19:52.338 --> 19:54.806
start the search.

19:54.807 --> 19:56.174
[Magnus]: Well, well.
Virgil St. Pierre,

19:56.175 --> 19:57.242
I presume.

19:58.277 --> 19:59.311
No offense,

19:59.312 --> 20:01.213
but I was
really hoping

20:01.214 --> 20:04.149
we wouldn't run into each other.

20:04.150 --> 20:05.951
It's kinda awkward.

20:05.952 --> 20:07.919
You attacked my people
this morning.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.554
Explain to me

20:09.555 --> 20:10.722
why I shouldn't just hand
you over to the police.

20:10.723 --> 20:12.424
Proof?

20:12.425 --> 20:13.692
Or shoot you.

20:13.693 --> 20:15.160
I was just trying
to get my suit back.

20:15.161 --> 20:16.194
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

20:16.195 --> 20:17.529
your suit?

20:17.530 --> 20:18.497
Yeah, my suit.

20:18.498 --> 20:19.631
I built it,

20:19.632 --> 20:21.366
with my scientists,

20:21.367 --> 20:23.435
in my lab, using my money,

20:23.436 --> 20:24.636
so it's--

20:25.738 --> 20:27.272
well, technically not my money,

20:27.273 --> 20:28.840
which is why
I have to get it back.

20:28.841 --> 20:29.708
What are you
talking about, dude?

20:29.709 --> 20:31.176
Our friend found that suit.

20:31.177 --> 20:32.444
In the hole in the woods?

20:32.445 --> 20:34.246
Yeah, I read
that script.

20:34.247 --> 20:36.248
That might be where he found it,

20:36.249 --> 20:37.182
but it wasn't

20:37.183 --> 20:39.184
where it was made.

20:39.185 --> 20:40.819
I was working on

20:40.820 --> 20:42.053
a ballistics protection suit

20:42.054 --> 20:46.191
using a species
of telepathic bacteria...

20:46.192 --> 20:47.292
And we had a little incident

20:47.293 --> 20:48.360
at our lab--

20:48.361 --> 20:49.327
The suit got away.

20:49.328 --> 20:50.562
Yes, the suit got away!

20:51.797 --> 20:53.164
I've been
trying to find it

20:53.165 --> 20:54.232
ever since,

20:54.233 --> 20:55.567
and I ran out of leads

20:55.568 --> 20:57.168
until your friend showed up
with the movie script.

20:57.169 --> 21:00.772
And you
sent that girl along.

21:00.773 --> 21:03.408
Well, the easiest way
to get information

21:03.409 --> 21:04.809
is to send a hot girl
to ask for it,

21:04.810 --> 21:06.778
right, Magnus?

21:06.779 --> 21:10.382
Not exactly a CIA spook,
your guy.

21:10.383 --> 21:13.184
You still haven't explained
how it ended up on Kate.

21:14.287 --> 21:15.186
That's a long story--

21:15.187 --> 21:16.388
make it a short one.

21:16.389 --> 21:17.689
Okay.

21:17.690 --> 21:19.658
Uh-huh...

21:19.659 --> 21:21.192
All right, will do.

21:21.193 --> 21:22.027
Who was that?

21:22.028 --> 21:23.094
Magnus.

21:23.095 --> 21:24.296
She wants me to
dispatch a search team

21:24.297 --> 21:25.497
to find Kate.

21:25.498 --> 21:26.464
Well, what are
they doing?

21:26.465 --> 21:28.133
Investigating
Virgil St. Pierre's lab.

21:28.134 --> 21:29.134
Well, they need
people on the street.

21:29.135 --> 21:30.168
Maybe you and I
could--

21:30.169 --> 21:31.136
No.

21:31.137 --> 21:31.970
Well, I could at least--

21:31.971 --> 21:33.338
No.

21:33.339 --> 21:36.274
You've done enough.

21:36.275 --> 21:37.409
Look...

21:37.410 --> 21:38.910
I know you're still
pissed off at me

21:38.911 --> 21:39.811
for what happened.

21:39.812 --> 21:40.645
And?

21:40.646 --> 21:41.713
And I can
help, okay?

21:41.714 --> 21:43.848
I know that suit.
I have mad skills.

21:43.849 --> 21:45.584
What kind of mad skills?

21:45.585 --> 21:47.619
I have an above average IQ

21:47.620 --> 21:49.454
and tremendous powers
of persuasion.

21:49.455 --> 21:50.622
Right.

21:50.623 --> 21:53.391
I'm a storyteller.

21:55.428 --> 21:58.229
All right, fine, okay?

21:58.230 --> 22:00.799
But I'm a fast learner,
and you can train me.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.834
I'll be Cyclops
to your Professor X.

22:02.835 --> 22:04.202
[Sighs]

22:04.203 --> 22:05.670
Please, just tell me
what I have to do

22:05.671 --> 22:06.571
to become one
of you guys.

22:06.572 --> 22:08.773
What's the application process?

22:08.774 --> 22:09.708
Interviews?

22:09.709 --> 22:10.875
I rock the interview!

22:10.876 --> 22:11.843
Job fairs?

22:11.844 --> 22:12.677
You really want to help?

22:12.678 --> 22:13.678
Yes, of course!

22:13.679 --> 22:14.512
Stay out of our way.

22:14.513 --> 22:15.447
No--

22:19.251 --> 22:20.885
that's cool.

22:20.886 --> 22:22.921
[Clears throat] That's cool.

22:22.922 --> 22:24.623
It's designed

22:24.624 --> 22:26.358
to separate the suit
from the host

22:26.359 --> 22:29.694
by suppressing
the pre-frontal cortex.

22:29.695 --> 22:30.795
The area of the brain

22:30.796 --> 22:32.163
that controls
decision-making

22:32.164 --> 22:33.431
and social behavior.

22:33.432 --> 22:35.233
Well, when these
cognitive functions

22:35.234 --> 22:36.501
are interfered with,

22:36.502 --> 22:38.770
the suit can't communicate
with the host

22:38.771 --> 22:40.772
and slides off.

22:40.773 --> 22:41.873
Unfortunately,

22:41.874 --> 22:43.508
we experienced
a power surge

22:43.509 --> 22:44.909
when the machine was in
the middle of its cycle.

22:44.910 --> 22:46.611
What effect
would that have?

22:46.612 --> 22:48.580
To be honest,
I don't know.

22:48.581 --> 22:49.681
We never accounted
for this possibility

22:49.682 --> 22:50.715
in the tests.

22:50.716 --> 22:52.951
Oh, good,
nice job. Great.

22:52.952 --> 22:54.886
If her
executive function

22:54.887 --> 22:56.221
has been compromised,

22:56.222 --> 22:57.889
she has no inhibitors.

22:57.890 --> 23:00.859
Her primary emotions
will rule her every move.

23:00.860 --> 23:02.327
Well, that could
get weird.

23:02.328 --> 23:04.529
That's not my first concern.

23:04.530 --> 23:05.930
How long do these effects last?

23:07.667 --> 23:09.934
The machine re-maps
the subject's neural pathways.

23:09.935 --> 23:11.936
Unless the damage
is undone,

23:11.937 --> 23:13.538
the brain will continue

23:13.539 --> 23:14.673
to re-map itself,

23:14.674 --> 23:17.275
potentially leading
to an aneurysm.

23:17.276 --> 23:19.444
We have to get the suit off

23:19.445 --> 23:20.945
before
it kills her.

23:20.946 --> 23:22.247
What do we do?

23:22.248 --> 23:23.648
I have an idea.

23:41.534 --> 23:43.301
So this guy tells me

23:43.302 --> 23:45.570
he can't finish this thing
until Tuesday, and then--

23:45.571 --> 23:47.005
[door crashes open]

23:48.274 --> 23:49.507
Who the hell?

23:53.479 --> 23:55.613
Kate Freelander.

23:55.614 --> 23:57.248
Hello, Brad.

23:59.251 --> 24:00.485
Long time no see.

24:00.486 --> 24:03.621
Nice outfit.

24:03.622 --> 24:05.557
Surprised
to see you

24:05.558 --> 24:07.425
after what went down
the last time.

24:07.426 --> 24:08.693
Aw...

24:08.694 --> 24:11.396
You stole my money
and hung me out to dry.

24:11.397 --> 24:14.599
Still holding a grudge.

24:14.600 --> 24:15.467
Me?

24:15.468 --> 24:17.869
No, I'm over it.

24:17.870 --> 24:20.472
I just came for an apology.

24:20.473 --> 24:21.639
[Snorts with laughter]

24:21.640 --> 24:22.607
[Laughing]

24:25.644 --> 24:27.278
Oh.

24:27.279 --> 24:29.380
I don't know what you're on,

24:29.381 --> 24:31.583
but you made
a big mistake

24:31.584 --> 24:33.184
coming here.

24:33.185 --> 24:35.553
I warned you I'd kill you
if I ever saw you again.

24:38.491 --> 24:40.692
Boys?

25:13.593 --> 25:14.491
Look

25:14.527 --> 25:16.561
Katie...

25:16.562 --> 25:18.363
[Laughs ingratiatingly]

25:19.465 --> 25:21.699
Aren't you
forgetting something?

25:21.700 --> 25:23.468
Um...

25:31.043 --> 25:34.412
My apology.

25:34.413 --> 25:36.047
I'm...

25:36.048 --> 25:37.715
Sorry?

25:37.716 --> 25:39.317
No.

25:40.319 --> 25:41.653
Like you mean it.

25:41.654 --> 25:45.056
I'm really, truly sorry.

25:46.559 --> 25:48.426
[Chuckles in satisfaction]

25:53.899 --> 25:55.667
Good boy.

25:55.668 --> 25:58.002
That wasn't
so hard, was it?

25:58.003 --> 26:00.405
If I ever see you again,

26:00.406 --> 26:01.973
I'll kill you.

26:01.974 --> 26:04.475
You understand?

26:14.920 --> 26:15.887
[Magnus]: You found it!

26:15.888 --> 26:16.721
Affirmative.

26:16.722 --> 26:18.590
[Will]: What is it?

26:18.591 --> 26:20.425
A terahertz
radiation generator.

26:20.426 --> 26:21.893
Cool.

26:21.894 --> 26:23.862
It's a specific range
of the em spectrum

26:23.863 --> 26:25.363
between infrared and microwaves.

26:25.364 --> 26:26.431
During the past year

26:26.432 --> 26:27.799
of studying
this creature,

26:27.800 --> 26:29.033
it's the only stimulus

26:29.034 --> 26:30.101
it ever responded to.

26:30.102 --> 26:31.102
If we can get
within a range

26:31.103 --> 26:32.503
of about three blocks,

26:32.504 --> 26:33.805
I think we can use this

26:33.806 --> 26:35.139
to lure the creature
towards us.

26:35.140 --> 26:36.074
Literally summon it,

26:36.075 --> 26:37.842
like targeting a beacon.

26:37.843 --> 26:39.978
Okay, so we get close to her
and we stun her.

26:39.979 --> 26:41.012
Actually, no.

26:41.013 --> 26:42.213
The sonic impulse

26:42.214 --> 26:43.982
could further damage
her neurological systems.

26:43.983 --> 26:45.750
We need a more
subtle solution.

26:45.751 --> 26:46.985
Such as?

26:46.986 --> 26:49.020
We transfer the suit to Walter.

26:49.021 --> 26:50.121
Right.

26:50.122 --> 26:51.956
Wait, what?

26:51.957 --> 26:54.692
Clearly, it won't
latch onto just anyone.

26:54.693 --> 26:55.994
You're the obvious
choice.

26:55.995 --> 26:56.861
[Will]: Well,
hold on a second.

26:56.862 --> 26:58.529
Is that gonna work?

26:58.530 --> 27:00.064
I mean, doesn't Kate
have to... wish it off?

27:00.065 --> 27:01.432
I don't think she has

27:01.433 --> 27:02.600
sufficient control
of her emotions at the moment

27:02.601 --> 27:03.902
to make that kind of decision.

27:03.903 --> 27:04.869
I'm hoping the suit

27:04.870 --> 27:06.070
will take the initiative
on its own.

27:06.071 --> 27:07.138
Hey, heads up,
everyone.

27:07.139 --> 27:08.339
A report just came through

27:08.340 --> 27:09.807
about a fight
in the warehouse district.

27:09.808 --> 27:10.942
Witnesses report a woman
in a leather suit

27:10.943 --> 27:13.044
leaving the scene.

27:15.781 --> 27:17.615
All right, we should be
safe in here.

27:17.616 --> 27:18.650
Between me and you,
this feels like...

27:18.651 --> 27:21.152
What's the word,
a long shot?

27:21.153 --> 27:23.087
Can't say
I disagree with you,

27:23.088 --> 27:25.523
but we've no choice.

27:25.524 --> 27:26.891
All right, stand back.

27:29.962 --> 27:31.596
[Sighs]

27:31.597 --> 27:32.730
[Beeps remote]

27:53.585 --> 27:55.453
[Emitter hums]

27:59.224 --> 28:01.559
Easy, no sudden moves.

28:07.933 --> 28:10.034
Go ahead, Walter.

28:13.505 --> 28:15.773
Hey, Kate.

28:15.774 --> 28:16.874
I-it's me.

28:16.875 --> 28:17.875
Don't you remember?

28:17.876 --> 28:19.110
Oh, the superhero.

28:23.048 --> 28:25.850
You want to play
with me?

28:25.851 --> 28:27.018
Come on.

28:27.019 --> 28:28.720
That's it,
little buddy.

28:28.721 --> 28:30.521

Oh, no.

doing?

Get back!

I thought we were
working together.

Please.
You're a child with money.

29:40.313 --> 29:41.947
Oh, that's mature.
It's my suit, Magnus--

29:41.948 --> 29:43.582
and that's a member of my team!

29:44.851 --> 29:46.718
Once she's
out of danger,

29:46.719 --> 29:47.753
we will discuss
the return of your suit,

Hey.

You okay?

30:03.870 --> 30:05.270
Why did it slip away?

30:05.271 --> 30:07.506
I don't know,
maybe it was scared.

30:07.507 --> 30:08.907
But I'm-I'm its friend.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.443
We were partners.

I think it didn't
like me anymore.

one more chance.

I think I can
convince it.

30:24.724 --> 30:25.590
It's too dangerous.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.759
We need to proceed
to plan B.

brings her down,

31:41.000 --> 31:42.100
there's no way

that she's turning
that suit over to us.

thing worse

32:09.629 --> 32:11.396
than not giving them
what they paid for

is letting it fall into
the hands of somebody else,

your little movie script,

who actually designed that suit,

some real liberties.

No.

sneak me a copy.

I could do

you through.

Well, I still
gotta do the movie,

it's a piece of crap.

41:51.876 --> 41:54.444
You know, you should fight.

41:54.445 --> 41:55.945
Tell 'em you want to
do it your way.

They own the rights, man.
