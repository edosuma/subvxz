WEBVTT

00:01.813 --> 00:05.480
- Someone broke into your car.
- They gained control of it remotely.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.212
Get this letter to Taylor.

00:07.237 --> 00:09.365
- I don't know where she is.
- Yes, you do.

00:09.390 --> 00:12.369
My mom's birth certificate
says she was underage.

00:12.445 --> 00:15.312
Guys like David get off with nothing.

00:15.333 --> 00:18.023
First order of business will be
to create a statement of claim.

00:18.048 --> 00:20.427
Everything you remember about
your encounters with David Hanley.

00:20.505 --> 00:22.290
<i>We don't have any kind of freedom!</i>

00:22.315 --> 00:24.290
- State your name for the court.
- Mara Tran.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.191
What's your relationship
to the accused?

00:26.216 --> 00:28.175
- I'm his girlfriend.
- Your Majesty.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.663
Joanna Chang, counsel for the accused.

00:33.857 --> 00:36.071
Manual roll-down windows
front and back,

00:36.153 --> 00:37.873
every door needs a key to open it,

00:37.898 --> 00:40.071
or ya pop it up from the inside here.

00:40.096 --> 00:42.202
- So nothing automatic?
- Nope.

00:42.227 --> 00:45.495
- But ah, the radio's busted.
- I'll take it.

00:46.137 --> 00:48.344
It's great.

00:48.451 --> 00:50.191
Pharmacy Benefit Managers

00:50.216 --> 00:52.764
stopped covering over a
thousand active ingredients

00:52.789 --> 00:54.362
in compounded drugs.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.162
So since your PBM limited
their insurance policy,

00:57.187 --> 00:59.188
you've received...

01:00.184 --> 01:02.915
Um, with your current policy,

01:02.985 --> 01:06.151
you've received 14 lawsuits
that aren't covered,

01:06.176 --> 01:10.785
but would have been... What
we're trying to decipher is...

01:10.810 --> 01:12.213
Under the previous policy...

01:12.272 --> 01:15.572
And due to vague laws governing PBMs...

01:18.087 --> 01:19.993
- Can I be excused?
- I'll take over.

01:20.069 --> 01:22.096
- It's going viral!
- What is?

01:22.121 --> 01:23.510
The video of me in court!

01:23.535 --> 01:25.670
Let me get this straight.
You interrupted a meeting

01:25.695 --> 01:28.530
with potential new clients because
you got new Twitter followers?

01:28.625 --> 01:32.461
I'm trending alt-right. Racists
and misogynists are claiming me.

01:32.608 --> 01:34.609
How's that possible?

01:34.781 --> 01:37.289
<i>Without choice, we don't have freedom.</i>

01:37.357 --> 01:39.879
<i>Take away our privacy
and we don't have anything!</i>

01:40.059 --> 01:42.321
A neo-Nazi posted
this ridiculous tweet.

01:42.878 --> 01:44.590
"Noah Achari fights for free speech".

01:44.615 --> 01:47.409
"No more left liberal censorship.
Demand privacy now".

01:47.434 --> 01:50.192
♪ firstamendment ♪freespeech"?
You didn't say that.

01:50.220 --> 01:53.249
Yeah. They're equating protecting
privacy with protecting hate speech,

01:53.346 --> 01:54.540
online harassment...

01:54.565 --> 01:56.539
Your followers are smart.
They'll see right through this.

01:56.583 --> 02:00.351
OK, how naïve are you?
I already have 3,000 retweets.

02:03.349 --> 02:05.879
Look, Joanna, it's
just that my parents,

02:05.904 --> 02:07.905
they immigrated here for me.

02:07.981 --> 02:09.495
They gave up everything.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.588
The idea of them getting
hate mail, threats...

02:12.654 --> 02:14.220
I-I can't let that happen.

02:14.321 --> 02:16.122
They're good people.

02:17.824 --> 02:19.025
- Listen...
- Boss,

02:19.126 --> 02:20.821
thought I'd stop in and check

02:20.846 --> 02:23.114
if you needed any help with the, uh...

02:25.421 --> 02:26.811
Is he okay?

02:26.900 --> 02:29.368
Noah! What are you doing?

02:31.348 --> 02:34.405
- What the hell is going on?
- Do you know what this is?!

02:34.430 --> 02:38.266
- It's a smoke detector!
- No. A surveillance camera.

02:38.380 --> 02:39.643
There's no download,

02:39.668 --> 02:43.298
it's just Wi-Fi so it can
livestream your every move and mine.

02:43.552 --> 02:47.137
Sunil, that plumbing inspection you
set up, that was Saturday morning?

02:47.524 --> 02:51.190
It was a standard inspection,
municipal government ordered it.

02:51.821 --> 02:53.771
Lovand, pulling strings
through government?

02:53.854 --> 02:56.926
OK, we do not stay here. It's not safe.

02:57.053 --> 02:59.465
- We'll go work from my house.
- I want to nail them.

02:59.525 --> 03:00.924
OK, well, use that rage.

03:00.949 --> 03:02.151
Keep this thing from snowballing.

03:02.176 --> 03:04.509
His popularity is supposed to help us.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.175 --> 03:43.768
Sharp!

03:57.224 --> 03:58.770
Hey, buddy.

03:58.969 --> 04:01.618
You want a granola bar? No? Okay.

04:02.679 --> 04:04.238
Who's this?

04:05.012 --> 04:06.980
- Get back here, man!
- I didn't take your money!

04:07.031 --> 04:09.496
- Get back here!
- It's okay. Go.

04:23.797 --> 04:29.070
Hey! Hey! Stop it!

04:29.277 --> 04:30.623
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

04:30.724 --> 04:33.292
I said stop it!

04:34.974 --> 04:37.209
Hey, Angie! I've got
one of your strays!

04:38.108 --> 04:40.199
Grab first aid.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.502
If he's been cut, we need
to get him to the hospital.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.295
You gonna eat that?

05:19.440 --> 05:21.105
Oh, you can have it.

05:21.426 --> 05:24.194
- I can...
- No, no, it's good.

05:43.959 --> 05:45.631
Oh...

05:46.192 --> 05:48.016
You meeting a date?

05:49.628 --> 05:53.239
- New shirt.
- That's perceptive.

05:53.572 --> 05:55.303
You ever considered law?

05:55.369 --> 05:59.001
- I prefer more honest work.
- I don't blame you.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.847
How you holding up?

06:01.948 --> 06:04.083
Waiting on his statement
of defense, not knowing

06:04.108 --> 06:06.009
how he's going to respond...
it's agony.

06:06.759 --> 06:08.164
You haven't heard anything
from their side?

06:12.343 --> 06:15.475
It's not the case.
Just my idiot brother.

06:16.383 --> 06:18.118
- Hey Shane, what's up?
- <i>Billy!</i>

06:18.191 --> 06:19.897
- I'm with Wendy.
- Hi.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.928
Ah, I am so sorry about this.

06:21.974 --> 06:25.165
- <i>About what?</i>
- Wendy's broken car.

06:25.312 --> 06:26.572
We are stranded

06:26.600 --> 06:29.202
- <i>about an hour out of town.</i>
- Where?

06:29.759 --> 06:31.425
A certain relative's residence.

06:31.498 --> 06:34.278
Alright, so, get that certain
relative to drive you.

06:34.374 --> 06:36.708
Yeah, no dice.

06:36.917 --> 06:39.051
Let me guess. He lost
his license again?

06:41.978 --> 06:44.775
Alright. I'm on my way.

06:45.711 --> 06:47.605
I thought you said
your place wasn't safe.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.909
Yeah, I dealt with that.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.569
Twitter is up to 8,000 mentions.

07:03.594 --> 07:05.635
You look guilty
not responding. Just deny it.

07:05.689 --> 07:07.298
Tweeting a denial will only make Noah

07:07.323 --> 07:09.244
look insensitive to hate speech.

07:09.269 --> 07:12.581
A thoughtful, personal
statement will not.

07:14.940 --> 07:16.680
To strip someone of their credibility

07:16.705 --> 07:18.335
takes specific strikes.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.996
We have to get ahead of Lovand
before they drop their next bomb.

07:21.034 --> 07:22.787
Oh really? A military analogy?

07:22.812 --> 07:24.395
How about, 'before they
play their next card'?

07:24.420 --> 07:26.921
- No. It'll be a bomb.
- They want you to give up.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.727
They're not gonna stop
at a smear campaign.

07:28.827 --> 07:30.492
Look how far they went
with Jared Lapinski.

07:30.593 --> 07:32.563
Wait. How do you know about that?

07:32.663 --> 07:35.205
I sent her the documents
we hacked on Jared.

07:35.339 --> 07:37.680
You weren't gonna do it
and she had to know.

07:37.867 --> 07:40.369
Noah and Jared, they were friends.

07:41.886 --> 07:43.601
Yeah.

07:43.848 --> 07:45.815
He helped me with the code
for the scrambling app.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.484
When he saw what Lovand
was doing, he came to me.

07:49.746 --> 07:52.814
He made GenBreach possible.
He trusted me.

07:53.282 --> 07:55.892
I couldn't even go to his funeral.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.503
I'm sorry.

07:58.950 --> 08:01.177
They went after his family.

08:01.202 --> 08:03.377
That's what finally broke him.

08:03.601 --> 08:06.787
And that's the kind of battle
you two are up against...

08:07.123 --> 08:09.562
if you leave GenBreach online.

08:13.703 --> 08:16.071
Hey, whatever happens...

08:19.088 --> 08:22.907
Yeah, uh, I'm not
taking down GenBreach.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.430
Then let's get to work.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.587
Hey! Doreen, right?

08:36.750 --> 08:39.934
Oh hey! Yeah. What's your name?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.539
- Luna.
- That's moon, right?

08:42.653 --> 08:46.790
- You a night owl?
- Not really.

08:46.968 --> 08:48.738
What First Nation are you from?

08:48.940 --> 08:51.007
Long Grass. What about you?

08:51.272 --> 08:53.176
I'm from Peguis.

08:53.645 --> 08:56.313
Ah shoot! I forgot my pads.

08:56.608 --> 08:58.981
Oh, hey, I probably have
a tampon somewhere in here.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.516
No, no, no, it's for my bra.
I leak milk like every night.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.575
Oh, you're breastfeeding.

09:08.119 --> 09:10.299
She yanks at my hair.

09:10.532 --> 09:13.296
- She's super cute.
- Yeah, I know.

09:13.321 --> 09:17.258
She looks just like her dad.
Not that she'll ever meet him.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.203
She's good,

09:20.786 --> 09:22.461
barely cries.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.441
Plus, these?

09:24.541 --> 09:26.131
I was flat.

09:29.776 --> 09:32.182
Well, thank god.

09:32.736 --> 09:35.738
Do you have a bag? I want to
grab some things from my van.

09:40.930 --> 09:43.532
What are you doing? Hop out.

09:44.243 --> 09:45.929
I'm good.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.065
Wendy's gonna take a minute.
Stretch your legs.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.937
You know, Dad was asking about you.

09:54.330 --> 09:56.106
I told him about the brewery.

09:56.212 --> 09:57.258
He said that

09:57.283 --> 09:59.539
if you want to start a business...

10:00.350 --> 10:02.369
Okay, if you go talk to him...

10:02.441 --> 10:07.065
Billy, I see what you're doing.

10:07.471 --> 10:11.121
You can't walk from here
to there and say hi?

10:11.212 --> 10:14.592
Alright, I'm leaving! Get in, stay,

10:14.656 --> 10:15.823
I don't care.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.282
- Shotgun.
- No.

10:24.595 --> 10:27.130
Look at us all together.

10:31.221 --> 10:33.779
<i>"I advocate for online
privacy laws to protect us"</i>

10:33.804 --> 10:36.301
<i>"from corporate manipulation
and government control."</i>

10:36.326 --> 10:39.188
"I do not support hate
speech or online harassment."

10:39.213 --> 10:41.455
"I do not tolerate bigotry."

10:42.995 --> 10:44.548
OK, I'm happy with that.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.194
Take a final read.

10:50.032 --> 10:53.434
Yeah. Yeah, no it's good.

10:54.265 --> 10:57.632
- "Noah Achari murdered Jared Lapinski"?
- What? Who said that?

10:57.872 --> 11:00.307
- I don't know.
- Don't open it. It's a virus.

11:00.407 --> 11:02.568
If you open that on our network,
it's gonna wipe our whole system.

11:02.744 --> 11:05.253
- Jesus. I can't do this...
- Noah,

11:05.321 --> 11:08.998
you need to focus. We need
to post that statement now.

11:10.135 --> 11:12.222
- Sent to you.
- Yeah, OK.

11:14.209 --> 11:16.743
Posted. Oh God.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.214
Now what do we do? Wait?

11:20.253 --> 11:22.180
No. Help me understand why

11:22.205 --> 11:25.620
keeping your data scrambling
app online is worth this fight.

11:25.645 --> 11:27.999
When you say
micro-expression data mining,

11:28.079 --> 11:32.158
- it sounds like sci-fi to me.
- Yeah, you and everybody else.

11:32.578 --> 11:34.836
Lovand doesn't want people
seeing the data

11:34.861 --> 11:37.296
that they're mining
from Hidden Complex.

11:38.538 --> 11:40.642
The people playing are their lab rats.

11:40.743 --> 11:44.994
- No, no, you play. I'll watch.
- It's the only way you'll understand.

11:50.610 --> 11:51.929
<i>New Player.</i>

11:51.954 --> 11:53.649
Yes.

11:55.046 --> 11:57.235
You got your baseline.
Now, you navigate.

11:57.260 --> 11:58.635
- Right.
- OK.

11:58.660 --> 12:01.592
Press Level 1. There.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.841
I'll bring some food
back for you two, OK?

12:09.094 --> 12:10.481
He's a dick.

12:10.687 --> 12:12.619
He never pays their full rate.

12:13.295 --> 12:15.835
Some kind of demented power trip.

12:15.930 --> 12:17.865
I wish I believed in hell;

12:18.174 --> 12:20.542
it would be satisfying
to know he'd end up in it.

12:21.096 --> 12:23.197
You could believe in karma.

12:30.865 --> 12:33.200
From my personal experience,

12:33.492 --> 12:35.764
karma is soft on men like him.

12:37.205 --> 12:38.583
Hi.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.332
Your call.

13:03.009 --> 13:04.509
I know you're working,

13:05.143 --> 13:07.004
but I read your claim

13:07.143 --> 13:10.665
and I felt that you deserved
to hear this in person.

13:11.952 --> 13:13.256
I'm sorry.

13:13.423 --> 13:15.753
I... I'm really sorry.

13:15.940 --> 13:17.624
I know what you're doing.

13:17.764 --> 13:21.712
You can save whatever backdoor offer
you're about to make for my lawyer.

13:41.435 --> 13:42.964
It's less than I claimed.

13:43.188 --> 13:46.381
It's way more than you'll get
going before a judge, believe me.

13:46.406 --> 13:47.923
I don't care.

13:48.143 --> 13:50.769
I want you exposed publicly
for what you did to me.

13:50.887 --> 13:54.426
And then what? When will it be enough?

13:54.886 --> 13:57.178
Because if I recall, you thought
the house was enough.

13:57.345 --> 13:59.314
But now you want justice,

13:59.415 --> 14:01.395
coincidentally right after
losing your job at the mill.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.895
No. I decided to sue you

14:03.920 --> 14:07.176
after I found out our criminal
justice system isn't exactly just.

14:07.236 --> 14:10.055
- I could've told you that.
- This isn't about your money.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.565
Yeah, OK.

14:11.728 --> 14:14.714
I'll be at the motel
for two days. Let me know.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.437
I don't want this.

14:17.784 --> 14:19.501
Then tear it up.

14:20.043 --> 14:21.840
Go ahead, tear it up.

14:24.833 --> 14:26.383
I thought so.

14:37.159 --> 14:39.199
<i>You know how long
it takes to register fear?</i>

14:39.246 --> 14:40.872
12,000ths of a second.

14:40.956 --> 14:42.890
That is what this app measures...

14:42.931 --> 14:45.901
the whites of your eyes,
the tiny expressions.

14:45.954 --> 14:49.379
The more you play the game, the more
it makes inferences about who you are.

14:49.404 --> 14:52.645
OK. Lovand wants to monopolize
the data mining industry.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.042
They have over 200 surveillance and
data mining contracts in the works.

14:56.122 --> 14:57.683
Yeah, one of the contracts

14:57.708 --> 15:00.088
is from a Toronto security company,

15:00.214 --> 15:02.388
represented by your old firm, CTS.

15:02.413 --> 15:03.851
Not surprising.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.881
So if Lovand can prove
the premise of their tech

15:06.906 --> 15:09.037
with Hidden Complex, they'll
release it on the market?

15:09.062 --> 15:10.852
We don't have proof, but yes.

15:10.928 --> 15:13.188
And your app scrambles the data,

15:13.289 --> 15:15.702
which sabotages their R and D.

15:15.727 --> 15:18.414
Yeah, but not enough people
know about my app.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.747
That's why I booked all those
university talks next month.

15:20.850 --> 15:23.164
To try and reach the mainstream.

15:23.671 --> 15:25.633
It's synthesizing.

15:30.873 --> 15:35.366
OK, keep in mind this is
just from the first levels.

15:35.546 --> 15:37.043
Get ready.

15:48.889 --> 15:50.692
Were you an orphan?

15:51.689 --> 15:53.228
No. My mom was sick.

15:53.675 --> 15:55.503
And my dad...

16:01.690 --> 16:03.199
Can you stop it?

16:03.524 --> 16:05.859
Turn it off.

16:10.151 --> 16:11.885
Let's fry the bastards.

16:25.487 --> 16:27.688
- Who is this?
- <i>Noah.</i>

16:28.934 --> 16:30.765
What happened?

16:30.951 --> 16:33.066
Lovand just dropped their next bomb.

16:33.468 --> 16:36.504
They found a photo. It's compromising.

16:38.907 --> 16:42.066
Josh Hentig is a featured speaker
at white nationalist rallies

16:42.091 --> 16:44.862
- and you took a picture with him?
- He ambushed me

16:44.887 --> 16:46.625
after a Silicon Valley tech conference.

16:46.725 --> 16:50.317
I just got off stage, and he was
like: "Noah! Long time, buddy!"

16:50.342 --> 16:52.617
And threw his arm around me
and took that photo.

16:52.795 --> 16:54.822
- You went to Stanford together?
- They weren't friends.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.595
Definitely not friends.
He used to call me turd-boy,

16:57.620 --> 17:01.011
which was not very creative,
but everyone laughed. So did I,

17:01.036 --> 17:03.074
because that's what you do.

17:03.252 --> 17:06.621
It's survival and it sucked.
One sec. Sorry.

17:07.016 --> 17:09.054
Okay, hey, what's up?

17:10.201 --> 17:14.192
The stress... Noah doesn't seem
to be handling it very well.

17:14.217 --> 17:15.663
Should we be worried?

17:16.034 --> 17:19.185
Well, he's not exactly
a happy guy to begin with.

17:20.550 --> 17:23.556
People throw the word depression
around, but when I met Noah?

17:23.580 --> 17:25.063
That was dark.

17:26.500 --> 17:30.403
I have this thought... If I can't
find him a way out, then he will.

17:31.194 --> 17:32.705
Like Jared.

17:34.755 --> 17:36.485
Uh, Noah and I weren't
gonna ask you this,

17:36.510 --> 17:38.341
but I don't know what else to do.

17:39.094 --> 17:42.588
Remember Noah said that CTS
represents one of Lovand's clients?

17:42.628 --> 17:44.006
The Toronto security company.

17:44.031 --> 17:47.294
We couldn't hack into their contract
with Lovand, but if you got it...

17:47.319 --> 17:49.964
I don't have access
to CTS contracts anymore.

17:50.065 --> 17:51.999
No, but your dad does.

17:55.321 --> 17:56.978
That was my agent.

17:57.293 --> 18:00.575
U of T and Dalhousie
just canceled my talk.

18:02.744 --> 18:05.492
I have liquids.

18:12.006 --> 18:14.846
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:14.926 --> 18:17.749
What happened last night?

18:18.182 --> 18:20.035
Are you OK?

18:26.711 --> 18:29.604
Sex workers shouldn't have
to put their lives in danger.

18:30.947 --> 18:32.982
There's so little being
done to help them.

18:33.016 --> 18:36.826
- You're helping, Lu.
- I'm handing out granola bars, smalls.

18:36.870 --> 18:38.743
I'm not changing the law.

18:41.515 --> 18:44.034
Maybe you should take a break

18:44.059 --> 18:45.820
from volunteering.

18:46.531 --> 18:48.706
The North End is so depressing.

18:48.731 --> 18:50.811
What? You have to admit
it's been getting you down.

18:50.836 --> 18:52.268
Let's just drop it, OK?

18:52.293 --> 18:54.278
I never know what to
say to you anymore.

18:54.303 --> 18:56.808
It's like, just tell me the
politically correct thing

18:56.833 --> 18:59.416
- you want me to say, and I'll say that.
- Just listen, OK?

18:59.441 --> 19:02.685
- Actually listen to me for once.
- For once?

19:02.765 --> 19:05.284
It's Taylor.

19:05.309 --> 19:09.247
She's borrowing the car to go
to Millwood. Don't get up.

19:11.853 --> 19:13.335
<i>- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

19:13.360 --> 19:14.455
<i>How are you?</i>

19:14.480 --> 19:17.179
<i>- I'm alright, how are you guys?
- Good. Um,</i>

19:17.258 --> 19:19.466
keys, keys... Don't know
where they are.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.691
I put them here every time, um.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.717
I always put them right here.

19:24.742 --> 19:27.443
Luna, have you seen my car keys?

19:27.510 --> 19:28.757
No.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.989
- Don't rush. There's no stress.
- Ugh!

19:32.395 --> 19:35.685
So what's the deal with visiting
your dad? What changed?

19:35.832 --> 19:37.772
I read his letter.

19:38.174 --> 19:40.908
- He kind of sounded sad.
- Well, duh. He messed up.

19:42.986 --> 19:44.130
Yeah.

19:44.213 --> 19:45.680
Kind of scared me, actually.

19:45.781 --> 19:47.557
Yes! Here.

19:50.604 --> 19:52.856
Hey, mind if I join you, actually?

19:52.881 --> 19:54.833
I want to go visit my mom.

19:54.956 --> 19:56.470
Yeah, sure.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.257
Um, do you want to come too?

20:04.220 --> 20:07.412
You know, I would, but I'm
feeling a little mom'd out.

20:34.017 --> 20:36.817
- You're dead!
- It's tradition, Billy! I'm sorry!

20:36.844 --> 20:38.633
I'm sorry! It's tradition!

20:41.994 --> 20:44.692
It's tradition!
It's tradition, Billy boy!

20:44.717 --> 20:47.908
- Come on!
- The Crawford Cup? Seriously?

20:48.747 --> 20:50.715
- I have work to do.
- OK, cool.

20:50.789 --> 20:52.713
- Yeah.
- Then the cup is mine.

20:52.879 --> 20:55.871
Any reigning champ that doesn't
accept a challenger immediately

20:55.896 --> 20:58.066
forfeits his or her title.
Bro, you made the rules.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.281
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, wait.

21:00.724 --> 21:03.527
Are you afraid that you don't
got it anymore, old man?

21:16.792 --> 21:19.133
- Joanna?
- <i>Hi, Dad.</i>

21:19.902 --> 21:21.602
Hi.

21:22.079 --> 21:24.643
I guess you can say you told me so.

21:24.739 --> 21:27.541
I'm in over my head with a case.

21:28.691 --> 21:31.178
Well, I'm sure it's nothing

21:31.203 --> 21:33.049
that we haven't weathered before.

21:33.183 --> 21:36.024
Um, how can I help?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.286
It isn't exactly above board.

21:40.527 --> 21:42.320
Is it ever?

21:43.966 --> 21:46.429
Why don't I meet you for lunch tomorrow

21:46.454 --> 21:48.455
and you can tell me all about it.

21:50.737 --> 21:52.132
It's kind of time sensitive.

21:52.597 --> 21:54.701
Oh, um...

21:56.999 --> 21:58.732
I'm in Millwood right now.

21:58.842 --> 22:02.231
<i>But I could meet you in the
city tonight for a late dinner.</i>

22:02.692 --> 22:04.989
<i>Nine, at Arturo's? What do you say?</i>

22:06.181 --> 22:09.316
You know what, I'm not doing this. Bye.

22:09.733 --> 22:11.233
Joanna?

22:25.894 --> 22:28.369
- What'd he say? - It's a dead end.
- He's not gonna help us?

22:28.517 --> 22:31.344
He's too busy in Millwood
fighting his civil suit.

22:32.734 --> 22:36.074
Ugh! Over 200,000 likes.

22:36.114 --> 22:39.146
60,000 retweets.
Josh Hentig is a popular guy.

22:39.506 --> 22:41.088
I got a million more followers.

22:41.142 --> 22:43.089
Guess what side of the
political spectrum they're on?

22:43.121 --> 22:44.315
OK,

22:44.342 --> 22:46.196
they hijacked your Twitter account,

22:46.221 --> 22:48.077
but what about your YouTube channel?

22:48.356 --> 22:51.625
Speak directly to your
most avid supporters.

22:52.569 --> 22:54.094
Yeah, that's a good idea.

22:54.195 --> 22:56.864
Forget the spin doctor crap.
Just do you.

22:58.693 --> 23:00.404
I think it's a good strategy.

23:00.484 --> 23:02.706
Keep me updated as it evolves.

23:07.976 --> 23:10.211
- Oof!
- Whoo!

23:10.319 --> 23:13.355
♪ I've got a feeling ♪
♪ Shane is gonna win the cup ♪

23:13.441 --> 23:15.088
I'm heading out.

23:15.221 --> 23:16.406
Only one more round.

23:16.431 --> 23:18.644
- I gotta figure out my van.
- No, Billy needs you to stay

23:18.669 --> 23:21.857
- so he can have a shoulder to cry on.
- I already called a cab.

23:22.031 --> 23:24.294
I've been with you
48 hours. I gotta go.

23:24.432 --> 23:27.201
- Bye, Billy! Don't kill each other.
- No promises.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.623
- Where you going?
- Hydrate.

23:30.672 --> 23:34.342
Ah, good idea. Check my bag
if there's none cold!

23:59.709 --> 24:02.077
Yo, check my bag, there's brews.

24:02.330 --> 24:06.003
It's the brand I buy for my truck.
Same ones I put in Wendy's van.

24:06.370 --> 24:08.176
That is some twisted psychology, Shane.

24:08.209 --> 24:10.344
- You did that to get me to see Dad?
- You caught me red-handed.

24:10.369 --> 24:12.127
How many times have
you called for help?

24:12.319 --> 24:13.887
Every time, I come through... why?

24:13.940 --> 24:15.699
Because that's you, man.

24:15.804 --> 24:17.596
You're the hero, not me.

24:17.679 --> 24:20.711
That's always the way it is.
Shane, the screw-up.

24:20.788 --> 24:23.846
- God forbid I try to help you for once.
- Is that what you call this?

24:25.167 --> 24:29.176
Man, your grudge against
Dad... I don't get it.

24:29.298 --> 24:31.151
I don't. You need to move on.

24:31.226 --> 24:34.994
- I don't need your advice.
- Talk about it, OK?

24:35.223 --> 24:37.233
Yes, he kicked the shit

24:37.258 --> 24:39.192
out of us, but with Mom gone,
he's the one we have left.

24:39.217 --> 24:42.519
- Shane.
- Please, go see him.

24:42.771 --> 24:45.444
He'll apologize to you.
It'll make things better.

24:45.469 --> 24:46.570
You don't know.

24:46.595 --> 24:48.135
You got to be a kid.

24:48.409 --> 24:50.510
I didn't. I had to
take care of everyone.

24:50.535 --> 24:53.211
- And that was your choice.
- My choice?

24:53.375 --> 24:57.397
My choice? The day he left, you
were playing in the backyard.

24:57.647 --> 24:59.396
He took me aside in the
kitchen and he said,

24:59.421 --> 25:01.599
"I guess you're the
man of the house now."

25:01.959 --> 25:03.183
I was eight.

25:03.318 --> 25:06.491
I had to be her little husband
at eight.

25:12.914 --> 25:14.815
I didn't know that.

25:15.010 --> 25:16.488
Now you do.

25:18.814 --> 25:20.234
I want you to leave.

25:20.702 --> 25:22.874
I need some space,
a couple nights on my own.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.007
Dude...

25:24.066 --> 25:26.254
What part of that don't you
understand, Shane?

25:27.489 --> 25:29.072
Pack your shit.

25:34.223 --> 25:36.731
Hey, have you seen Noah's video?

25:36.832 --> 25:39.305
- No. He posted it?
- I've got it right here.

25:39.441 --> 25:41.432
<i>Hi, Noah Achari here.</i>

25:41.503 --> 25:44.809
<i>It seems that a lot of people are
confused about what I stand for,</i>

25:44.940 --> 25:48.363
<i>so here's a little about me.</i>

25:48.388 --> 25:50.642
<i>I was hired by Lovand</i>

25:50.667 --> 25:53.275
<i>the multinational war
profiteering corporation</i>

25:53.300 --> 25:55.074
<i>when I was 19 years old.</i>

25:55.814 --> 25:59.304
<i>I thought I was going to go
protect the society.</i>

25:59.788 --> 26:03.191
<i>I was very ignorant, having
spent my whole life coding.</i>

26:03.565 --> 26:05.900
- <i>The projects I worked on for Lovand</i>
- What's he doing?

26:06.014 --> 26:07.915
<i>taught me how wrong I was.</i>

26:08.921 --> 26:11.265
He can't speak about
his contract with Lovand.

26:11.290 --> 26:14.826
- He has an NDA.
- <i>Money, making as much money</i>

26:14.977 --> 26:18.439
<i>as they can, that's what they
protect. And get this...</i>

26:18.534 --> 26:21.770
<i>Hey, this is Noah's voicemail.
Leave a message or not.</i>

26:23.026 --> 26:24.473
He breached his DNA.

26:24.532 --> 26:27.552
- What are the liquidated damages?
- Two million.

26:28.183 --> 26:31.218
<i>I don't regret working for Lovand. No.</i>

26:31.824 --> 26:33.092
<i>Even though I contributed</i>

26:33.117 --> 26:35.620
<i>to people's privacy
being outright violated.</i>

26:35.710 --> 26:37.207
<i>Because after quitting...</i>

26:37.232 --> 26:40.001
<i>Hey, this is Noah's voicemail.
Leave a message or not.</i>

26:40.655 --> 26:42.696
<i>What if you took all the evil crap</i>

26:42.721 --> 26:45.022
<i>that you knew that you did</i>

26:45.313 --> 26:47.381
<i>and use it to protect people?</i>

26:47.661 --> 26:49.167
<i>Make a difference.</i>

26:52.154 --> 26:53.688
Yeah, that...

26:55.177 --> 26:56.839
that didn't work out.

26:57.779 --> 26:59.249
I'm sorry.

27:00.068 --> 27:03.304
Forgive me. Forgive me.

27:04.813 --> 27:06.479
He's giving up.

27:10.159 --> 27:13.107
Scour the NDA agreement for
mistakes, things like "and/or".

27:13.132 --> 27:14.636
Lovand needs to prove damages,

27:14.661 --> 27:16.286
- but it's not...
- Joanna. Do you have a minute?

27:18.983 --> 27:21.747
I'm taking you off this case
and appointing Sunil as lead.

27:21.780 --> 27:24.448
What? No, this is my case.

27:24.797 --> 27:28.031
With respect, Sunil is not ready.

27:28.179 --> 27:31.930
To mitigate damages in a
losing trial? He will be fine.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.321
We landed the pharmacist class-action.

27:34.394 --> 27:36.671
This is an opportunity
to set precedent.

27:36.791 --> 27:37.886
I can do both.

27:37.911 --> 27:40.282
How? Noah has you running
from one fire to the next.

27:40.307 --> 27:42.315
Joanna, you are far too valuable

27:42.340 --> 27:44.855
- for damage control.
- Just let me talk to him

27:44.880 --> 27:46.453
and I can turn things around.

27:46.491 --> 27:49.293
I'm sorry, Joanna. This is
my call. And I'm making it.

27:50.602 --> 27:53.419
OK. Can I let him down in person?

27:53.444 --> 27:56.119
It will be an easier
transition to Sunil.

27:56.230 --> 27:59.448
- Of course. Just make it quick.
- OK.

28:21.826 --> 28:24.996
- Mom?
- Luna?

28:25.319 --> 28:28.003
- Hey, baby!
- Hi!

28:28.707 --> 28:30.448
This is a nice surprise.

28:30.473 --> 28:32.594
If you told me,
I would've gotten tonight off work.

28:32.619 --> 28:34.155
That's OK.

28:35.387 --> 28:36.873
What's the matter?

28:37.120 --> 28:40.077
I've just missed you. I've missed home.

28:40.524 --> 28:42.362
OK, now I know something's wrong.

28:45.089 --> 28:47.700
- I met this woman...
- Someone at university?

28:47.726 --> 28:50.561
No, no, no, not like that.
Molly and I, we're fine.

28:51.143 --> 28:53.090
It was with Bear Clan Patrol.

28:54.061 --> 28:55.593
Her name's Doreen.

28:56.607 --> 28:59.130
She's Native and she's a single mom.

28:59.231 --> 29:02.199
Doreen's this amazing person,
like funny,

29:02.224 --> 29:05.751
and smart, and she protected me,

29:05.878 --> 29:08.951
and-and she's getting into cars

29:08.977 --> 29:12.296
with strange men and there is no one

29:12.350 --> 29:14.284
protecting <i>her.</i>

29:15.578 --> 29:17.815
- And she...
- Come here, come here.

29:17.916 --> 29:21.441
Shh. It's OK.

29:39.471 --> 29:42.573
Hi. One second.

29:46.178 --> 29:49.732
Wow! Look at you.

29:49.974 --> 29:53.317
Um, I brought this for you, it's a...

29:54.039 --> 29:57.674
- Vanilla latte, your favourite, right?
- Thanks.

29:59.734 --> 30:01.635
Do you want to sit down?
Do you wanna go for a walk?

30:01.660 --> 30:04.362
- No, this is good. This is fine here.
- OK.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.301
You look good.

30:10.512 --> 30:11.996
Older.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.745
You look different too.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.515
It's, it's the hair.
I think I'm thinning.

30:19.265 --> 30:20.878
You gonna drink that or what?

30:21.312 --> 30:24.382
Uh, my naturopath actually
has me off sugar.

30:24.626 --> 30:27.351
You have a naturopath? Wow.

30:27.541 --> 30:30.047
Well, glad that you're
taking care of yourself.

30:31.086 --> 30:32.590
But no sugar, really?

30:32.624 --> 30:35.870
Don't people need sugar? Fruit?

30:36.270 --> 30:39.530
Yeah, I have most fruits.
It's just processed sugars.

30:39.631 --> 30:42.934
Oh, OK, gotcha. 'Cause
you need your vitamin C.

30:44.389 --> 30:46.290
I'm just concerned about your health.

30:46.384 --> 30:48.319
You're concerned about my health?

30:52.252 --> 30:54.145
Dad, you made us sick.

30:54.175 --> 30:56.813
Hey, Taylor, you know what?
I know that you took the money,

30:56.948 --> 30:59.982
and it's OK, I don't want
any of it back.

31:00.262 --> 31:03.046
This is about moving on from all that.

31:04.403 --> 31:08.206
I'm living in a fog most days.

31:08.849 --> 31:11.341
And I don't know
if that's from depression

31:11.366 --> 31:13.276
or the treatments.

31:13.438 --> 31:16.240
My cancer might come back, Dad.

31:16.567 --> 31:19.057
I don't know how to move on from that.

31:24.564 --> 31:26.241
What? Wait. Where are you going?

31:26.288 --> 31:28.389
This was obviously a mistake.

31:28.613 --> 31:31.182
- Please don't contact me again.
- Taylor, don't.

31:31.408 --> 31:33.379
Taylor, come back!

31:38.676 --> 31:40.115
Oh.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.261
Hey. How'd it go?

31:45.744 --> 31:48.779
He just doesn't care.
He just doesn't care.

31:52.771 --> 31:54.371
Let's hang out tonight, yeah?

31:54.927 --> 31:57.394
Uh, we can, we can watch sad movies

31:57.419 --> 32:00.875
and cry into an extra-large pizza.

32:02.901 --> 32:04.869
I thought you were with your mom?

32:05.216 --> 32:07.985
She goes to work at eight.
I can come over then.

32:08.167 --> 32:10.557
Okay. Yeah. Thanks.

32:17.529 --> 32:20.290
- It's over, Mara.
- No. What do we say?

32:20.403 --> 32:22.333
Whatever happens...

32:22.434 --> 32:24.668
Whatever happens...

32:25.342 --> 32:27.341
Don't watch it burn.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.488
Joanna, do you have
the injunction documents?

32:32.535 --> 32:34.945
- I wanna sign them.
- Take your app down?

32:35.046 --> 32:36.480
- Are you sure?
- No, you can't take it down.

32:36.505 --> 32:40.047
Noah, this is bigger than you,
or me... or any of them.

32:40.253 --> 32:42.774
Caleb? He's flying in tonight.

32:42.847 --> 32:46.689
And so are Jackie
and Fuzhan. To help us.

32:46.849 --> 32:48.879
OK. Now. I want to sign them now.

32:48.927 --> 32:53.445
- Yes.
- Noah, please...

32:54.393 --> 32:57.928
Don't give up on this.
Don't give up on us.

33:02.646 --> 33:04.008
Are you happy?

33:04.109 --> 33:06.820
Is this what you wanted
from the beginning?

33:07.492 --> 33:09.925
Mara, OK? They're gonna
come after you next.

33:09.957 --> 33:12.485
And then my parents? I can't have that.

33:12.665 --> 33:15.072
OK? It's over. Mara, it's OK.

33:15.097 --> 33:16.658
It's over.

33:18.016 --> 33:21.218
I'm not gonna stand by
to watch it burn.

33:28.117 --> 33:29.833
I...

33:30.475 --> 33:32.476
will take it down by midnight.

33:37.102 --> 33:41.443
Caleb, Jackie and Fuzhan...
Who are they?

33:42.022 --> 33:43.902
Friends, I guess.
Other Internet hacktivists.

33:43.927 --> 33:46.362
Lab rats I tested GenBreach on.

33:49.729 --> 33:51.488
Mara said they're coming in tonight.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.959
Yeah. I don't wanna see them.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.084
No, before you take GenBreach offline,

33:57.268 --> 33:59.108
maybe there's something we can try.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.373
I spoke with Lovand's lawyers.

34:03.398 --> 34:05.437
It seemed like they were
anticipating you

34:05.484 --> 34:06.510
calling this sit-in.

34:06.535 --> 34:08.263
I'm not surprised. Their smear campaign

34:08.288 --> 34:10.603
destroyed my client
in less than 48 hours.

34:10.628 --> 34:13.167
OK, you're hard to read,
but you don't seem upset.

34:13.192 --> 34:14.382
This isn't over yet.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.230
You got an ace up your sleeve?

34:16.328 --> 34:18.020
Do tell.

34:24.849 --> 34:27.462
Make me a copy of this.
And it is classified,

34:27.543 --> 34:30.868
- so don't leave it around.
- You got it, boss.

34:45.577 --> 34:49.743
- Why would you do this?
- No, I take them for my own records...

34:49.795 --> 34:50.980
You're working for Lovand?

34:51.052 --> 34:53.320
- No, no, Joanna, it's for me.
- Security!

34:53.538 --> 34:55.655
Do you know what happens
to lawyers who trade secrets?

34:55.748 --> 34:57.788
- They get disbarred.
- What's going on?

34:58.077 --> 34:59.957
I caught him red-handed.

35:00.281 --> 35:04.324
The smoke detector.
You let them surveil me.

35:04.551 --> 35:06.730
Confiscate his computer. And
don't let him out of your sight.

35:06.831 --> 35:09.840
Joanna, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

35:10.613 --> 35:13.480
Joanna, this is serious. You
still keeping the Lovand meeting?

35:13.554 --> 35:16.106
You better believe it.
This doesn't change a thing.

35:21.267 --> 35:25.415
<i>Just gonna finish this up.
Then I'll be out of your hair.</i>

35:32.011 --> 35:33.912
- You staying at Wendy's?
- No.

35:34.013 --> 35:37.706
I think I've officially
maxed out my sibs.

35:37.910 --> 35:39.676
I'll stay at the motel.

35:43.461 --> 35:44.853
Yo.

35:47.566 --> 35:49.428
I, uh...

35:51.150 --> 35:53.904
I never realized
how hard it was for you.

35:57.129 --> 35:59.133
Well, then I did my job.

36:21.272 --> 36:23.019
What are <i>you doing here?</i>

36:24.564 --> 36:28.069
Believe me, if there were another
hotel within 30 miles I'd be there.

36:28.249 --> 36:30.095
I don't know what your mother
told you, but it's a good offer.

36:30.119 --> 36:31.970
She should take it.

36:32.071 --> 36:34.890
What are you talking about? What offer?

36:36.855 --> 36:39.715
Never mind. Go home.

36:40.168 --> 36:42.178
Wait, you offered her money?!

36:42.984 --> 36:44.342
- Go talk to your mother.
- No.

36:44.367 --> 36:46.029
I'm talking to you.

36:46.112 --> 36:49.585
And I'll decide when I go,
Dad. You're my dad.

36:49.692 --> 36:51.025
You are!

36:51.117 --> 36:55.794
You slept with a teenager
and then you left her.

36:55.895 --> 36:58.322
You live in this delusional world,

36:58.347 --> 37:00.884
but my mom didn't get to.

37:01.037 --> 37:03.135
She had to raise me alone

37:03.160 --> 37:05.580
in the very real world.

37:05.647 --> 37:08.073
Like every other
single mother out there...

37:08.731 --> 37:10.856
- What are you doing?
- I've had enough

37:10.897 --> 37:14.258
crazy bitch for one evening.
I'm calling the police.

37:15.248 --> 37:17.115
- Gimme that!
- Hey!

37:18.399 --> 37:20.191
Let go of me!

37:21.745 --> 37:23.496
Give me that!

37:25.432 --> 37:26.869
<i>First of all, thank you</i>

37:26.894 --> 37:30.833
for meeting on such short notice
and giving up your evening.

37:31.464 --> 37:33.498
I notice your client didn't make it.

37:33.910 --> 37:36.902
- He's had a difficult two days.
- So have we.

37:37.003 --> 37:38.726
Your client violated his NDA

37:38.751 --> 37:41.172
and purposefully attacked
my client's reputation.

37:41.532 --> 37:43.656
We just want this all to
be over and done with.

37:43.747 --> 37:45.619
My client feels the same.

37:45.873 --> 37:49.377
It took him reaching the point
of having nothing left to lose.

38:32.238 --> 38:34.306
The attention my
client's received online

38:34.331 --> 38:36.939
has placed him in a rare limelight.

38:37.032 --> 38:40.371
Anything that he posts next
will predictably trend.

38:40.396 --> 38:41.701
Ms. Chang,

38:41.846 --> 38:44.010
you've told us Noah
was willing to comply

38:44.035 --> 38:46.577
with the court injunction
to remove GenBreach.

38:46.672 --> 38:48.773
If you could get on with your terms.

38:49.314 --> 38:50.933
Of course.

38:55.787 --> 38:57.641
Hidden Complex fine print.

38:57.784 --> 39:00.188
"...granting the Company
unrestricted license"

39:00.213 --> 39:03.246
"to use, copy, adapt, and sublicense"

39:03.271 --> 39:04.340
"your data."

39:04.365 --> 39:06.394
That's what the players agree to?

39:06.534 --> 39:08.251
Seems fairly benign.

39:09.105 --> 39:11.508
This, on the other hand,

39:11.603 --> 39:13.805
does not.

39:17.123 --> 39:20.321
It will be posted on my client's
Twitter account in an hour.

39:20.387 --> 39:23.263
That's theft. The data is
proprietary of Lovand.

39:23.309 --> 39:26.695
Really? It says Jackie has
conflicting responses to intimacy.

39:26.788 --> 39:28.680
Caleb is Type A,

39:28.787 --> 39:32.873
and Fuzhan suffers PTSD
from a possible assault.

39:33.027 --> 39:35.858
Is that your data? Because
it feels like it's theirs.

39:35.883 --> 39:37.489
Posting it would be a criminal offence.

39:37.725 --> 39:40.492
Funny what happens when
someone in the public eye

39:40.517 --> 39:42.573
has nothing left to lose.

39:53.570 --> 39:55.240
Waive your rights to sue my client

39:55.265 --> 39:57.340
for violation of his NDA,

39:57.610 --> 40:00.720
and drop your lawsuit and injunction
against his app, GenBreach,

40:00.745 --> 40:03.714
and none of this will go public.

40:05.784 --> 40:08.875
You have a half hour
to complete the paperwork.

40:24.715 --> 40:26.568
Tell Noah we'll see him around.

40:30.148 --> 40:33.078
- She's basic, but it was all her, OK?
- We make a good team.

40:33.103 --> 40:35.556
No. As you can see, she
doesn't take praise very well.

40:35.581 --> 40:36.705
What if I give you another
compliment right now?

40:36.729 --> 40:38.307
I will drop you as a client.

40:42.794 --> 40:46.262
Hey, I know Lovand's come back
twice as hard at us,

40:46.287 --> 40:49.149
but let's just enjoy the moment.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.024
- Right?
- OK.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.361
- Billy?
- <i>Joanna?</i>

40:58.540 --> 41:01.881
I'm just out with a client right now.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.758
Sorry, I can't hear you.

41:03.975 --> 41:05.441
Joanna?

41:05.595 --> 41:07.575
Joanna, can you hear me?

41:08.701 --> 41:10.756
No, can you hear me?

41:11.252 --> 41:13.018
<i>The line is bad. You're breaking up.</i>

41:13.650 --> 41:17.747
Joanna, you need to come home.
No. No, listen.

41:17.794 --> 41:21.192
Listen to me. I'm at the motel.

41:23.170 --> 41:24.829
It's your dad.

41:25.634 --> 41:28.967
- What are you saying?
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

41:30.408 --> 41:32.335
They found him in his room.

41:42.003 --> 41:43.569
<i>Where are you?</i>

41:43.669 --> 41:45.904
<i>Can you hear me? Where are you?</i>
