Hey, Alan,
meet my mother, Robin.

00:05.132 --> 00:07.349
- Nice to meet you, Alan.
- Likewise.

- Bridget?
- I can't sign the divorce papers.

00:13.390 --> 00:16.725
I love you, and
I want you back.

00:17.660 --> 00:20.612
I want you so badly.

00:20.614 --> 00:23.115
I... want you, too.

I don't think it's a good
idea to sleep with you,

00:24.671 --> 00:25.889

someone new,

00:25.914 --> 00:27.481
and I think she might
be the real deal.

00:27.921 --> 00:30.122
Not that you weren't the
real deal; you're just

00:30.124 --> 00:34.259
the ex-real deal, and
she's the next real deal.

00:34.261 --> 00:36.411
I can't believe you waited till
I was half-naked in your bed

00:36.413 --> 00:37.963
to tell me you were seeing
someone else.

00:37.965 --> 00:40.766

you're taking off my pants.

Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

02:16.864 --> 02:18.697

the company

02:18.699 --> 02:21.800

way I want.

The stock of the company is

03:55.068 --> 03:56.484

to name a fourth
