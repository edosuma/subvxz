to kill my brother.

00:10.428 --> 00:12.168
You're going to need this.
Thanks.

00:12.305 --> 00:14.512
I want Johnny Jaqobis
to go free.
You have a deal.

00:14.599 --> 00:16.590
This is why we needed
Dutch's DNA.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.764
So what did I miss?

00:17.852 --> 00:19.843
THE LADY:
What are you to me
if you don’t deliver?

00:19.937 --> 00:23.646
Either find Pree or find
someone who will burn
down the galaxy for him.

00:23.733 --> 00:26.099
We need to
wake up Westerley.
Yeah, starting with Gared.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.479
TU RIN: He’s safer in the dark.

00:27.570 --> 00:30.562
I'm in the middle
of a prison beef
with my old pal Coren Jeers.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.237

got us a chip.

So long as we survive
the next few hours,
nothing's changed.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.803
We still need the ship,

to get the message out.

01:42.812 --> 01:47.101
Yeah, but then
Sparlo and Jeers
hijacked our hijack,

01:47.191 --> 01:50.354
so, you know,
it's kind of a wash.

01:51.279 --> 01:54.146

That's about the
primest one they can find.

the Qreshis come
to negotiate on a ship

05:38.547 --> 05:40.333
You need
a cover story,
like,

05:40.424 --> 05:43.166
the Warden lost control
of one wing during
the Bellaxion.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.716
Her Qreshi guests
were taken

05:44.803 --> 05:46.930
and she doesn't
want to come in
guns blazing

05:47.014 --> 05:49.847
until the Qreshis are out
safely, so she'll negotiate
for their return.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.174
That actually makes sense.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.804
Except we don't
have the Warden.

I trust you?

there was one place
I would be safe.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.009
So he put me back
in a cube.

into the Quad to save my dad.

for passage.

putting it out there,

take the credit
for this.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.854

leave me a gun

08:44.942 --> 08:46.773

will take her from me.

No ransom, no questions.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.066

to Westerley.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.816
There's no
going home for me.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.287

But ifyou actually
want her back alive,
let me find her.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.944
And you're gonna
do that how, exactly?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.696
She gave me
this signal receiver.

10:20.996 --> 10:24.113

track her back to
wherever she is.

to the Warden's office.

to do the negotiating,

finding the Qreshi.

I don't need anymore
is you, Sparlo.

one for partnerships.

to die like that.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.861
No, he didn't.

But what's done is done,
and we need the ransom
to survive.

of sense, Mace.

use another

and go see some Qreshis
about a ransom.

getting used to

the more it shocks you?

12:04.975 --> 12:06.181
Yes, pretty much.

seem like
a very good idea.

a Qreshi champion
at the end.

it was a bad idea.

and arms trading,

can alter a subject's memory

22:02.864 --> 22:05.776
You don't get to change
our plans without
consulting me.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.903
That's very
human of you.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.781
Wow, ifyou have
something to say, say it.
Mom?

22:10.872 --> 22:12.487
BOTH: Which one?

22:16.294 --> 22:19.411
You cheated.
We want our money back.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.418
Well, it's nice
to want things.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.716
But cards is
a game of chance.
We were just lucky.

22:24.802 --> 22:27.214
Bullshit. I saw this one.

22:27.972 --> 22:31.260
Whispering in your ear
before every damn round.

22:31.351 --> 22:34.218
You seemed to know every time
what we were gonna play.

22:34.312 --> 22:35.427
lcachatcheaﬂng.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.888
And I call this
refunding you
your whole ass.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.139
Argh!

22:39.234 --> 22:41.566
Oh, right. Not Hullen.
Keep forgetting.

22:41.653 --> 22:42.984
Enough!

22:45.698 --> 22:49.031
l have had
a very trying day.

22:50.161 --> 22:54.871
Touch my family again,
and I will feed you
your own skin.

22:58.336 --> 23:01.703
and lwill put my foot
so far up your ass,

23:01.798 --> 23:04.881
you will taste
my ancestor's boots.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.551
Who's first?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.050
Thoughtso.

23:17.522 --> 23:18.932
That's my mom.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.482
WARDEN: I'll say this
forthe Killjoys.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.816
Never seen a crew
so dedicated to each other.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.064
JOHN: What do you mean?

23:27.282 --> 23:29.238
The only way I could keep
Yardeen in those fights

23:29.325 --> 23:30.735
was to promise to let you go.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.035
She was fighting
to get me off
the ship?

23:36.249 --> 23:37.705
You didn't know?

23:37.792 --> 23:39.748
NEWCY: Johnny?
Newcy?

23:39.836 --> 23:41.246
I’m in the mainframe.

23:41.337 --> 23:42.873
l have control
of the comms array,

23:42.964 --> 23:44.750
the loudspeaker system,
everything.

23:44.841 --> 23:46.502
Look!

23:46.593 --> 23:48.834
Okay. Easy there, girl.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.340
(DOOR OPENING)

23:54.434 --> 23:55.844
All right,
shouldn't be long.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.893
Just a slight delay.
All right, Captain Pike.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.720
Let's cut the
bullshit now,
shall we?

24:00.815 --> 24:04.023
I know the difference
between negotiating
and stalling for time,

24:04.110 --> 24:06.772
and you are definitely
doing the latter.
The only question is, why?

24:06.863 --> 24:09.696
What the hells are you doing?
You're screwing up my deal.

24:09.782 --> 24:10.897
Your deal?

24:10.992 --> 24:13.734
NEWCY:
Dutch, you’re in danger.
Lucy?

24:13.828 --> 24:15.864
How does ajunker
like this have Al?

24:15.955 --> 24:17.456
And who the shit is Dutch?

24:17.749 --> 24:20.081
Whoa, whoa,
everyone relax.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.667
NEWCY:
Since the situation
is deteriorating,

24:22.754 --> 24:24.836
John would
like me to inform you
that the Qreshi team

24:24.922 --> 24:26.958
is planting explosives
throughout the ship.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.921
We can still work this out.
Coren, you idiot.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.798
Don't you see
what's going on?

24:32.889 --> 24:34.299
They're not here
to save their people.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.802
They're here to
make sure their people
never get out alive.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.475
Well, give
the lady a prize.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.761
You cheating
rat bastard!

24:47.278 --> 24:49.189
Forget them!
They're dead anyway!

24:58.289 --> 25:00.871
(BOTH GRUNTING)

25:05.088 --> 25:06.419
Argh!

25:15.932 --> 25:17.888
DUTCH:
Mace, you don't
want to do this.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.300
Shoot, you stupid
piece of...
(GUN FIRES)

25:26.359 --> 25:28.224
Sparlo was
a son of a bitch.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.310
But he didn't deserve
to die like that.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.199
Then help me honor his memory.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.613
We always figured
we'd die on this ship.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.491
I'm still okay with that.
Good luck...

25:47.296 --> 25:48.627
Killjoy.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.582
Good luck, Mace.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.469
Okay, boys. Here I come.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.179
Coren? Mace?

26:03.271 --> 26:04.886
Is there anybody?
Fall over.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.437
Excuse me?
Sitting on the floor
is bad enough.

26:07.525 --> 26:08.890
I said fall over.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.896
Ooh!

26:12.488 --> 26:15.901
Hey, hey.
Something's wrong.
She's not breathing.

26:17.744 --> 26:20.201
Hey, come on, man.
You don't wanna lose
a hostage, do you?

26:36.053 --> 26:37.509
(BODY THUDS)

26:38.139 --> 26:39.595
Okay, we gotta figure out
what's going on.
(GUN COCKS)

26:39.682 --> 26:40.797
EVI: I'm gonna finish this.

26:40.892 --> 26:42.382
Now!

26:42.477 --> 26:44.092
Oh, come on!

27:05.708 --> 27:07.244
Put it down.
You first.

27:07.710 --> 27:08.950
She's on our side, Dutch.

27:10.213 --> 27:12.920
Okay, side-ish.
But we all want
the same thing,

27:13.007 --> 27:14.292
to get this ship
back from Coren.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.634
Coren's dead.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.583
Our biggest problem
is the Qreshi kill squad.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.464
Where the hells are they,
and where are their bombs?

27:19.555 --> 27:21.716
NEWCY: Johnny.
Yes, Newcy?

27:21.808 --> 27:25.676
l have identified three more
sites where the fusion
charges have been laid,

27:25.770 --> 27:30.264
but I’m also tracking five
individuals heading
directly to section 5-C.

27:30.358 --> 27:31.848
That's the personal
quarters area.

27:31.943 --> 27:33.479
If that's where D'av
and the Robbels are...

27:33.569 --> 27:35.855
I'll take care of the bombs.
You go save your friend.

27:35.947 --> 27:37.483
Why would you trust her?

27:37.573 --> 27:40.030
'Cause she hasn't
tried to kick me off
the ship, for one.

27:42.036 --> 27:43.867
Um, Johnny, maybe
this isn't the time.

27:43.955 --> 27:45.491
I didn't try
to kick you off.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.162
It was so you could get
a message out to Zeph.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.366
We're in a floating
satellite dish, Dutch.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.961
I think I'm pretty good
at hitting send.

27:51.045 --> 27:52.831
Okay, I'm gonna
go take care of
the bombs,

27:52.922 --> 27:54.583
but, as a former
psychiatrist,

27:54.674 --> 27:56.414
I suggest you two work
your shit out

27:56.509 --> 27:58.625
before your
friend dies.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.803
Do you know what you're
also really good at?

28:02.890 --> 28:04.426
Icing me out.

28:04.517 --> 28:05.723
Icing you?

28:05.810 --> 28:08.677
It hasn't exactly been easy
for me since we got
out of Old Town, Dutch.

28:09.230 --> 28:10.686
And it was for me?

28:11.440 --> 28:14.432
lwas there too, Johnny.
I remember us too.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.855
Did you ever ask me
how I felt?

28:19.949 --> 28:22.907
So, yeah, I did try
to send you away.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.785
Because whatever
you were going through,

28:26.205 --> 28:28.366
it was easier
to have you gone
than to have you here

28:28.457 --> 28:29.867
and not be my friend.

28:33.504 --> 28:37.713
Give me a sec.
Ijust got a message with
a weird encryption key.

28:37.800 --> 28:41.088
So you're a Killjoy?
That's right, honey.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.679
Maybe you could be
a Killjoy too.

28:43.514 --> 28:46.221
Whatever I do,
I'm pretty sure
I work for a living, son.

28:46.809 --> 28:49.596
Well, Zeph, he might
not know who he is,
but he's still an asshole.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.598
(GASPS)
You're proud of this?

28:51.689 --> 28:53.554
It's him! It's Johnny.

28:54.025 --> 28:55.140
He sent a message.

28:55.985 --> 28:59.398
They're alive on
the Herks Supermax
Prison Ship.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.319
Nice friends you have.
Shh!

29:01.657 --> 29:02.646
Okay.

29:03.618 --> 29:06.576
Coren Jeers,
gladiator fights... Cool.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.163
Anyway, they have a plan.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.953
When they get back,
we have to evacuate
Old Town.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.248
PREE OVER COMPUTER:
E vacuating a whole city
with no memory of its past...

29:12.335 --> 29:13.370
How hard can that be?

29:13.461 --> 29:15.122
Hey, wait.
What’s the last part?

29:15.713 --> 29:18.170
What? "Herks
has been hijacked.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.669
"Man y hostages,
Qreshis trying to
blow up the ship. "

29:20.968 --> 29:22.344
Gods.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.060
You don't
wanna do this, Evi.

29:30.144 --> 29:31.930
Oh, I really, really do.

29:32.021 --> 29:34.478
Okay, well...
You shouldn't.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.013
VVhy?

29:37.485 --> 29:39.225
Uh...
Oh, thank you very much.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.026
N EWCY:
Actual/y, D’a vin,
if it helps,

29:41.113 --> 29:44.071
there are three
Qreshi soldiers on
their way to kill all of you.

29:44.158 --> 29:46.149
Lucy?
"Newcy. "

29:46.243 --> 29:47.983
Why is the ship
talking to you?

29:48.079 --> 29:50.616
And what Qreshi soldiers
are coming to kill us?

29:51.082 --> 29:53.619
Members of Land Robbel’s
security force.

29:53.709 --> 29:54.824
What is wrong
with you people?

29:54.919 --> 29:56.875
Is anyone in your family
not trying to kill
each other?

29:56.963 --> 29:59.079
I'm sorry,
have you never
had a family dispute?

29:59.173 --> 30:02.006
Seriously.
I've never tried
to kill my brother!

30:03.344 --> 30:05.585
Intentionally.
Look, the point is...

30:05.680 --> 30:08.547
lfyou die,
I'm the next in line
of succession,

30:08.683 --> 30:09.923
if I get married.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.008
But if I die too...

30:12.770 --> 30:14.886
It stays with Uncle.
Mmm.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.096
See?

30:16.399 --> 30:17.935
You guys
don't have a problem
with each other.

30:18.025 --> 30:21.859
Your uncle is using
this opportunity
to kill you both.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.902
So why don't
you do something
completely crazy,

30:23.990 --> 30:26.948
and be a family
that fights together?

30:32.498 --> 30:33.783
But you'd better do it fast.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.834
As soon
as the door opens,
start shooting.

30:38.921 --> 30:41.128
Um, yeah, what if they,
like, start shooting back?

30:41.674 --> 30:42.959
They probably will.

30:43.050 --> 30:46.634
I'lljust think of Uncle,
and shooting him
in his big, stupid face.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.383
(GUNS FIRING)

31:11.120 --> 31:12.451
Die!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:12.538 --> 31:13.653
No,no,no,no!

31:14.707 --> 31:16.538
Who's got a kiss
for Daddy?
(SMOOCHES)

31:17.918 --> 31:19.533
I'm gonna noogie you!
Okay, okay.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.880
Put me down!
How old are you? Dick!

31:22.631 --> 31:25.122
Did you want me
to touch your head
like that?

31:25.718 --> 31:27.208
Hey.
Hey.

31:28.095 --> 31:30.131
Tough day at the office?
You don't know
the half of it.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.053
NEWCY: Johnny.
No, no, no, Newcy.

31:32.183 --> 31:33.969
If it's bad news,
I don't wanna hear it.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.300
Okay, then.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.641
So literal.
Okay, fine,
what is it?

31:43.819 --> 31:46.777
There is an orbiter-class
cruiser making its way to
our coordinates

31:46.864 --> 31:48.149
at maximum speed.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.525
"Orbiter-class"?

31:50.493 --> 31:52.074
It's the armada.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.110
They're coming for us.

32:11.430 --> 32:15.673
Kendry, grab Jaq's bag,
wait here. I need
to speak with him.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.772
(GRUNTS)

32:24.527 --> 32:26.483
Did you just throw
forest filth at me?

32:26.570 --> 32:29.482
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

32:30.574 --> 32:32.951
I suffered for you!

32:33.119 --> 32:35.610
I carried
a Jaqobis for you!

32:36.413 --> 32:38.699
And lwill not
carry bags for you.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.831
I love you, Aneela.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.296
But you do not get to
treat me like I'm less

32:48.384 --> 32:49.874
now that I'm a human.

32:51.345 --> 32:54.462
No one is
more queen than me.

32:58.269 --> 32:59.850
You haven't changed.

33:01.856 --> 33:03.437
I thought I lost you.

33:04.608 --> 33:07.099
Because I'm human?
Because I'm not.

33:09.363 --> 33:13.652
I don't care
how others see me.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.902
But I don't wanna be
a monster to you.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.368
Aneela, I may be human.

33:23.252 --> 33:26.085
But I am still
a really terrible person.

33:26.172 --> 33:28.288
You're just saying that.
No,no,no.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.418
I've never been good
with empathy.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.625
You should have seen me
in my early human days.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.426
Oh, I was the worst.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.631
Okay, go away.

33:38.976 --> 33:41.012
I'm going to be sexual
with your mother now.

33:41.145 --> 33:42.180
Ugh.

33:42.271 --> 33:46.105
Maybe we need
to get you back into
a few human social customs.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.644
Wait. lfyou aren't
angry with me,

33:52.323 --> 33:53.733
why only two travelers?

33:53.824 --> 33:57.112
Because you're not
the one staying.

33:59.663 --> 34:00.698
lam.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.201
What about lunch?

34:05.502 --> 34:07.458
We'll talk
about food later.

34:15.262 --> 34:16.672
We have a problem.

34:18.557 --> 34:21.515
All right, guess we
have to deal with this.

34:22.478 --> 34:23.934
Despite your
pretty outfit,

34:24.021 --> 34:25.636
I am still the commander
of this ship.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.642
No, it's not that.
The person that
put us here

34:27.733 --> 34:29.018
is coming, and fast.

34:29.109 --> 34:30.849
And knowing what
you know about
us now,

34:30.945 --> 34:33.812
there's no way she's letting
anybody get out of here alive.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.271
Well, engines are
already at max output.

34:35.366 --> 34:36.776
What kind of weaponry
you have on this beast?

34:36.867 --> 34:38.448
Cannons?
Frag blasters?

34:38.535 --> 34:41.663
Well, the smugglers
who owned this ship first
had some old cannons

34:41.747 --> 34:43.203
to scare away pirates,
but that's about it.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.576
As long as we're here,
she's gonna keep
coming for us.

34:45.668 --> 34:46.783
We need an evac.

34:47.503 --> 34:50.119
You still want to save
the prisoners?
This isn't their fight.

34:50.214 --> 34:52.455
But now we have
the Qreshi kill
squad's ship,

34:52.549 --> 34:54.460
and the Robbels said that
we can have those, too.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.802
The Robbels offered this?

34:55.886 --> 34:57.797
Well, it took a bit
ofnegoﬂaﬂng.

34:57.888 --> 35:01.380
Yelling, threats of violence.
But if we move now,
then we can get going.

35:01.475 --> 35:02.885
No, we're not going anywhere.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.014
Warden, what did you do
with those fusion bombs?

35:09.608 --> 35:11.894
Khlyen!
Who set this course?

35:12.278 --> 35:15.395
Once in firing range,
decrease thrust
to half speed. I did.

35:15.489 --> 35:16.774
Under whose authority?

35:16.865 --> 35:18.196
Scan for
any escape pods
or vessels.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.240
And the authority
is your own command.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.073
The prison ship
we put Yala on is in danger.
You still need her.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.779
THE LADY:
I need a lure.

35:25.874 --> 35:27.205
We have three.

35:27.376 --> 35:29.708
And whatever
danger they're in
is most likely due to her.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.956
I made a promise!
Stop!

35:37.177 --> 35:38.337
A promise?

35:39.346 --> 35:40.631
To who?

35:41.932 --> 35:43.638
To you, of course.

35:45.102 --> 35:47.593
I learned about this
through our spy
inside the terrorist cell.

35:47.688 --> 35:51.306
I was planning on sending
a team to raid them
once we secured Yala.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.517
Sensors show a midrange
transport vessel leaving
the Herks' main hangar.

35:57.364 --> 35:58.444
Prepare to intercept them.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.365
THE LADY: What was that?
COMMANDER: The transport
vesseland”.

36:06.874 --> 36:08.205
The Herks, it...

36:09.877 --> 36:11.993
They're gone.
What do you mean?

36:12.546 --> 36:13.626
Where?

36:14.298 --> 36:15.959
COMMANDER: There was
a massive energy surge.

36:16.050 --> 36:18.632
Most likely
a thermal explosion.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.130
There's nothing left.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.937
So, is it working?

36:32.024 --> 36:33.264
N ewcy?

36:33.692 --> 36:36.855
N EWCY:
Cloaking broadcaster
is still at maximum output.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.028
So they really
can't see us?

36:40.491 --> 36:41.731
Well...

36:43.369 --> 36:44.734
They're not moving.

36:44.828 --> 36:48.036
Well, I guess all those
fusion bombs on that
unmanned Qreshi vessel

36:48.123 --> 36:49.909
made for a pretty
convincing boom.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.616
It also caused some minor
cosmetic damage to the hull.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.667
/ will inform Warden Rennika.

36:54.755 --> 36:58.373
Just let me tell her.
Eventually.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.708
You know,
we could use her
on our side.

37:00.803 --> 37:03.044
Well, we saved her from
the biggest dickbag
in the J.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.844
It's a start.
It's more than that.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.014
If she goes
along with this,
we have our ship.

37:08.811 --> 37:12.053
And as for the Lady,
she thinks we're
dead and gone.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.148
This is a whole new beginning.

37:34.336 --> 37:36.327
(SNIFFLING QUIETLY)

37:42.302 --> 37:44.008
You did yourjob, Jaq.

37:44.805 --> 37:46.295
You rescued me.

37:47.558 --> 37:49.423
Now let me do
the same for you.

38:03.031 --> 38:04.567
Don't worry, Jaq.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.654
It'll keep you
safe from her
the way it kept me.

38:16.295 --> 38:18.377
Please tell me
you know how
to fight her.

38:19.882 --> 38:21.213
Not yet.

38:21.842 --> 38:23.753
But I know
what she wants.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.595
And I know how to get it.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.685
FANCY: lget why
she had to shock me
to wake me up

38:39.776 --> 38:42.267
but I don't get why
she had to mess
with my brain first.

38:42.362 --> 38:45.274
Science, darling.
You're a trailblazer.

38:46.742 --> 38:48.027
Where is everybody?

38:48.785 --> 38:50.912
OFFICER OVER RADIO:
Unit 27, reports
of possible activity.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.611
All units report location...

38:53.081 --> 38:55.117
MAN: He's here!
Run, Pree, lgot this.

38:56.210 --> 38:58.417
OFFICERS: Don't move!

39:07.596 --> 39:09.757
JOHN: lshould
have asked you how
you felt about Old Town.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.014
DUTCH: Johnny, no, it’s fine.
It didn’t matter.

39:13.101 --> 39:16.309
Yes, it did.
But not the way
that you think.

39:19.191 --> 39:21.147
You know what I can't
get out of my mind?

39:21.652 --> 39:23.233
That dinner
that we had
at the Royale.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.563
(CHUCKLES)

39:24.988 --> 39:26.068
Yeah.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.363
Your theory of marriage
as a sausage?

39:28.450 --> 39:29.986
Give it time.
It's a keeper.

39:31.203 --> 39:33.319
The thing that
I realized is that...

39:33.413 --> 39:35.870
It wasn't you that
I was missing, Dutch.

39:35.958 --> 39:38.324
lmean, I...
llove you.

39:39.753 --> 39:41.664
But not like that.

39:42.923 --> 39:44.129
It was that dinner.

39:45.551 --> 39:48.384
Not being shot at
or almost blown up.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.098
I want that.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.681
I need that.
Johnny.

39:57.604 --> 40:00.437
lwould never
stop you from going.

40:00.524 --> 40:03.982
I know that you wouldn't,
but this job is our life.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.192
Can we still keep this
without that?

40:12.786 --> 40:14.492
We still have
a fight to win.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.993
Maybe we make it,
maybe we don't.
But if we do...

40:18.500 --> 40:21.537
It's time for sausages
with someone else.

40:21.628 --> 40:22.708
See?

40:23.589 --> 40:24.624
It's a real wiener.

40:25.382 --> 40:26.997
(BOTHLAUGH)

40:28.385 --> 40:30.751
You know, you were
born to be a Killjoy.

40:30.846 --> 40:33.337
But maybe I wasn't,
and, you know,

40:33.432 --> 40:37.095
I was just afraid
to say that to you
because I might lose you.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.477
Johnny Jaqobis,

40:49.281 --> 40:52.865
lam proposing

40:53.910 --> 40:55.320
a one-year.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.778
A what?
When this is over,

40:58.624 --> 41:01.240
you are taking
a Killjoy's sabbatical.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.914
And then travel,
steal ships,
I don't know... Dance.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.461
(LAUGHS)

41:08.634 --> 41:13.628
And if, in a year,
you find something
better...

41:15.766 --> 41:18.178
I'm gonna personally
fire your ass.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.136
And you're gonna
go to your farm,

41:23.231 --> 41:24.971
and you're gonna
have your robot goats

41:25.067 --> 41:28.059
and you're
gonna find someone
to make sausages with.

41:31.406 --> 41:32.987
And you're never
gonna lose me.

41:35.869 --> 41:39.111
Unless you
give me the shitty
guest bed, okay?

41:39.665 --> 41:42.077
(LAUGHS) Okay, okay.

41:42.209 --> 41:43.699
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

41:45.879 --> 41:46.914
What is it now?

41:47.005 --> 41:48.666
Well, the rest
of the prison's
waking up.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.122
Looks like a hell
of a hangover.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.457
Great. Four thousand
pissed off convicts.

41:52.552 --> 41:55.134
What could be better?
Could be worse.

41:55.555 --> 41:56.715
Could be hippies.

41:56.807 --> 41:59.719
WARDEN:
We've lost 18 prisoners
and 21 guards,

41:59.810 --> 42:02.643
and are still taking stock
of the damage to the ship.

42:03.355 --> 42:07.223
But first, the fact
that any of us are
still standing here

42:07.317 --> 42:09.524
isthanksto
these three Killjoys,

42:10.362 --> 42:13.320
who risked their lives
to save all your asses.

42:14.658 --> 42:16.023
And mine.

42:20.122 --> 42:21.862
(ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
