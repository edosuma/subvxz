You're wanted by all
these medical companies

11:45.200 --> 11:47.900

your mother a little kiss.

I wanna go home.

my family, why?

22:23.200 --> 22:26.200
What kinda people are you?

22:26.233 --> 22:29.066
What kind of importance

23:29.333 --> 23:32.833
Look deeply, Doctor Burns.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.633
Is there something

- [Voiceover] If
you're just joining us,

23:58.333 --> 24:00.133
we're live in downtown Detroit,

24:00.166 --> 24:03.666
where an explosion has
led to a devastating fire

24:03.700 --> 24:05.966
on the campus of
Cortland College.

24:06.933 --> 24:10.033
One staff member has

24:12.966 --> 24:14.666
a professor in the Cortland
pharmacology department.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.000

24:17.133 --> 24:20.266

11th, Doctor Burns.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.100
- What have you done?

24:23.033 --> 24:25.966
- Tell me about January
11th, Doctor Burns.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.066

the hell that means!

24:40.133 --> 24:41.800
What is this?

24:41.833 --> 24:44.800
- You know exactly what that is.

24:45.866 --> 24:47.033
- [mumbling] discovery?

24:47.066 --> 24:48.366
- Very good.

24:48.400 --> 24:51.066
- No, I mean, I know of it.

24:51.100 --> 24:52.900
It was a side project of his.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.166
A treatment of pre-gangrenous
sores to prevent amputation.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.166
I've never actually seen
the target findings.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.766
He was very, very private
with his personal work.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.233
- But you admit your
connection to this.

25:06.266 --> 25:08.333
- I'm his associate
professor, that's it!

25:08.366 --> 25:09.833
If he was up to something else,

25:09.866 --> 25:11.700
then I have no
idea what that was!

25:11.733 --> 25:14.200
This is the first I've
seen of any of this.

25:14.233 --> 25:16.200
I'm telling you.

25:16.233 --> 25:18.033
- We will see.

25:18.066 --> 25:20.100
- Who are you?

25:20.133 --> 25:22.366
The CIA? FBI?

25:22.400 --> 25:23.800
Because, I swear to you,

25:23.833 --> 25:25.400
you have the wrong person!

25:25.433 --> 25:28.333
- You leave me so few options.

25:28.366 --> 25:31.800
- I'm an associate
professor, for God's sakes!

25:32.266 --> 25:35.133
I have a family and
a mortgage, please,

25:35.166 --> 25:36.200
I don't know what you think

25:36.233 --> 25:38.900
I could possibly
be involved with!

25:38.933 --> 25:42.100
Please! I shouldn't be here!

25:42.133 --> 25:43.966
I shouldn't be here!

25:57.133 --> 25:58.266
Finish it.

26:04.933 --> 26:06.766
- [Amanda] Emily.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.100
Emily!

26:10.266 --> 26:11.766
Emily!

26:13.100 --> 26:14.333
What's going on?

26:14.366 --> 26:16.300
What's happening?

26:17.500 --> 26:19.166
- They killed him.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.733
- Who? Who did they kill?

26:22.766 --> 26:24.033
- Cobb.

26:24.066 --> 26:25.033
- What?

26:25.066 --> 26:26.200
- He's dead.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.366
- No.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.166
No, that can't be true.

26:31.866 --> 26:33.400
They're lying,
they're lying to you.

26:33.433 --> 26:35.333
- They burned it
down, all of it.

26:35.366 --> 26:37.800
The lab, the annex, everything.

26:37.833 --> 26:39.466
- This can't be happening.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.033
This can't be happening.

26:41.066 --> 26:44.000
Why? What reason would
they have to do that?

26:44.033 --> 26:46.166
- A set up, to prove a
point, to cover something up,

26:46.200 --> 26:48.000
because they're insane?

26:48.033 --> 26:49.833
- Wait, just calm down.

26:49.866 --> 26:51.166
- The two of us, who
knows if we'll ever

26:51.200 --> 26:52.300
get out of here alive.

26:52.333 --> 26:53.466
- I'm scared enough as it is

26:53.500 --> 26:55.933
without you saying
these things Emily.

26:55.966 --> 26:57.300
Just calm down.

26:58.466 --> 27:00.166
- I'm gonna ask you something,

27:00.200 --> 27:02.166
and I need an honest answer.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.200
- Did they ask you
anything specific?

27:03.233 --> 27:04.366
- This is very important.

27:04.400 --> 27:05.933
- Emily.
- [Emily] Amanda, please.

27:05.966 --> 27:07.000
- What did they say to you?

27:07.033 --> 27:09.200
- Damn it Amanda, listen!

27:11.933 --> 27:13.533
Was there anything
going on with Cobb

27:13.566 --> 27:15.200
that I didn't know about?

27:15.233 --> 27:18.066
Anything suspicious or unusual?

27:18.100 --> 27:19.166
- No.

27:20.366 --> 27:22.233
Not that I know of.

27:25.033 --> 27:26.133
Wait!

27:26.166 --> 27:28.000
Wait, no, I'm sorry!

27:28.033 --> 27:30.333
Emily, please, I'm sorry!

27:31.400 --> 27:33.066
Emily.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.366
What is this?

27:38.400 --> 27:40.133
- Project Hazel.

27:45.266 --> 27:47.866
- [Amanda]
Pre-gangrenous treatment?

27:47.900 --> 27:49.366
I don't understand.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.533
- They want me to finish it.

27:51.566 --> 27:53.400
- This is what they want?

27:53.433 --> 27:55.833
They want you to finish it?

27:55.866 --> 27:57.500
- I can't do that.

27:57.533 --> 27:58.833
- Emily, please!

27:58.866 --> 28:00.933
- If I could, I would.

28:00.966 --> 28:03.166
And if they're smart
enough to pull off

28:03.200 --> 28:05.933
whatever this is
they know that too.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.033
There has to be more to this.

28:08.066 --> 28:10.100
- You have to try, our
lives depend on it!

28:10.133 --> 28:11.066
- Amanda, please.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.400
- Emily, try!

28:12.433 --> 28:14.366
- Damn it, Amanda, do
you really wanna help?

28:14.400 --> 28:15.400
- Of course.

28:15.433 --> 28:17.100
- Don't be so naive.

28:17.933 --> 28:20.200
You know without the proper
screening tools I can't just...

28:20.233 --> 28:21.600
- Just show your next move,

28:21.633 --> 28:23.866
do anything, show them
you're willing to cooperate.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.866

- Four.

33:58.266 --> 33:59.200
- [Emily] Are you sure?

33:59.233 --> 34:00.966
I thought you were three.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.666
You're four?

34:02.700 --> 34:05.333
- I'm gonna eat the
whole thing in one bite!

34:05.366 --> 34:08.199

might get sick after that.

34:10.632 --> 34:11.766

You've been making

Just do it.

56:54.700 --> 56:57.966
Are you ready to
give me what I need?

56:58.000 --> 56:59.933
- Go fuck yourself.

57:05.100 --> 57:06.666

57:07.666 --> 57:08.833
Fight!

57:31.366 --> 57:34.300
Congratulations, Doctor Burns,

57:34.333 --> 57:37.600
you'll be seeing your
daughter soon enough.

57:43.833 --> 57:46.000
- Hey George.

57:46.033 --> 57:47.100
- It's time.

57:47.133 --> 57:48.833
- No, it's too soon.

57:48.866 --> 57:50.166
- I said it's time!

57:50.200 --> 57:52.266
- [Henchman] No,
stick to the plan!

57:52.300 --> 57:54.400
- Tape four.

57:54.433 --> 57:55.700
- But sir, you can't--

57:55.733 --> 57:57.133
- I said tape four!

Maddie?

58:09.700 --> 58:11.800
Sweetheart?

58:11.833 --> 58:14.266
Maddie, counting to 100.

58:15.366 --> 58:17.033
Where are you?

58:17.066 --> 58:18.800
Maddie?

58:20.233 --> 58:21.333
Maddie!

- [Emily] Hello?

01:00:31.166 --> 01:00:33.200
Hello, I have to
use the bathroom!

01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:37.066
Hello! Somebody!

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.900
I have to go to the bathroom!

01:00:40.133 --> 01:00:42.200
[footsteps]

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.066
Please, I just really have
to go to the bathroom.

01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:02.000
- [Henchman] No.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.066
- I'm not gonna go to
the bathroom in here.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.800
- [Henchman] Suit yourself.

01:01:07.433 --> 01:01:09.033
- Please, please, I'll talk,

01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:10.033
I'll tell you whatever
you wanna know,

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:10.966
everything about January 11th,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.866
I'll finish the formula,
anything you want.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.266
Please.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.566
- [Henchman] Is that so?

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.533
- Yes, just let me
use the bathroom,

01:01:18.566 --> 01:01:20.300
and for God's sake,
something else to eat,

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:21.333
and I'll talk.

01:01:21.366 --> 01:01:22.300
I just,

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.066
just need to see my daughter.

01:01:28.466 --> 01:01:30.966
- [Henchman] You hear that?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.100
- [Man] Make it quick.

01:01:33.133 --> 01:01:35.033
- [Henchman] Got it.

01:01:41.066 --> 01:01:42.566

Drop the gun Doctor Burns.

01:02:18.133 --> 01:02:19.566
- You're out of your mind.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.300
- No one is getting shot.

01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:22.933
- Move over, now!

01:02:22.966 --> 01:02:25.033
- I'm going to step forward now.

01:02:25.066 --> 01:02:26.333

01:02:32.133 --> 01:02:33.966
What the?

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.100
I knew this.

01:02:43.133 --> 01:02:44.433
- What did you know?

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.200
- You wouldn't be hurt.

01:02:47.233 --> 01:02:48.466
- Why?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.600
- Blanks.

01:02:58.133 --> 01:02:59.666

- What is this?

01:03:03.133 --> 01:03:06.333
- You tell me, Doctor Burns.

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.133
- I can't.
- [Man] You can.

01:03:09.033 --> 01:03:12.033
You just have to try.

01:03:24.466 --> 01:03:28.166
You can drop the gun at
any time Doctor Burns.

01:03:29.133 --> 01:03:31.166
It serves you no purpose.

Doctor Burns?

- I don't.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.466
- Tell me about January
11th, Doctor Burns.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.200
- It's only like January--

01:04:50.233 --> 01:04:52.333
- January 3rd?

01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:54.166
I know.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.800
You've been saying that

01:04:55.833 --> 01:04:58.266
for the past four months.

01:05:00.433 --> 01:05:01.500
- What?

01:05:02.633 --> 01:05:05.133
[ominous music]

01:05:53.566 --> 01:05:55.133
Maddie!

Andrew.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.800
What is this?

01:06:05.833 --> 01:06:07.700
What is this?

01:06:07.733 --> 01:06:09.400
What is this?

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:10.600
Andrew.

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.100
What is this?

01:06:12.133 --> 01:06:13.366
- Doctor Burns.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.300
[suspenseful music]

01:06:44.933 --> 01:06:47.833
I apologize for all
these precautions,

01:06:47.866 --> 01:06:49.333
but please try to stay calm,

01:06:49.366 --> 01:06:51.166
we haven't much time.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.200
- Much time?

01:06:54.233 --> 01:06:55.866
Andrew, what's he talking about?

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.900
- Doctor Burns, in
less than 30 minutes,

01:06:58.933 --> 01:07:00.666
this all will go away.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.700
As if it never happened.

01:07:01.733 --> 01:07:02.933
So I can't stress enough,

01:07:02.966 --> 01:07:05.500
every second counts.

01:07:06.733 --> 01:07:08.766
My name is Doctor Norman Atley,

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.533
do you know me?

01:07:10.566 --> 01:07:11.900
[ticking]

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.300
- No.

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:15.933
- I'm your doctor, my dear.

01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:17.700
More than that, I'm your friend.

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:19.900
These men on the floor,
they're also your friends.

01:07:19.933 --> 01:07:22.200
Now listen, I need you to focus.

01:07:22.233 --> 01:07:23.600
- Andrew, what's happening?

01:07:23.633 --> 01:07:26.633
- Emmy, do what he says, please.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.233
- Doctor Burns,

01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:36.266
I need you to think
about why you're here.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.700
The answer is in you,

01:07:38.733 --> 01:07:40.466
it always has been.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.500
You just need to find it.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.233
January 11th.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.600
January 11th.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.533

[garbled speech]

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.933
- You name it.

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.466
Okay, Tuesday.

01:08:26.966 --> 01:08:28.466
Yeah.

01:08:29.566 --> 01:08:30.600
Yeah.

01:08:34.066 --> 01:08:35.233
Yeah.

01:08:35.966 --> 01:08:39.533
All right, yes, I promise you!

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.265
You really need to work on
expanding your horizons.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.765
- [Man] Repetition
is something to be...

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.366
[old-fashioned music]

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:50.633
- [Emily] I'll find your target.

01:08:54.933 --> 01:08:57.399
- Jesus, I think
you nailed it Emily.

01:08:59.832 --> 01:09:00.899
This is great.

01:09:00.933 --> 01:09:01.899
- That's a stretch.

01:09:01.933 --> 01:09:05.466
- I don't know, I think
this looks really solid.

01:09:08.033 --> 01:09:10.300
I'm confident in
taking it to the lab.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.566
- Oh my god.

01:09:32.466 --> 01:09:33.733
- What?

01:09:33.765 --> 01:09:35.966
- I have to make a call.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.600
- Everything all right?

01:09:38.433 --> 01:09:40.966
- Yeah, yeah, I just
have to make a call.

01:09:42.533 --> 01:09:45.033
- Well fine, go
ahead, use my line.

01:09:45.066 --> 01:09:47.933
I'm gonna take this down
to the lab, get it prepped.

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:02.800
- [Emily] Hey.

01:10:02.833 --> 01:10:04.033
- [Andrew] I was just
about to call you.

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:06.366
- [Emily] Yeah, I'm just gonna
be a couple of minutes late.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.466
[sighs]

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.733
- [Andrew] You
forgot, didn't you?

01:10:08.766 --> 01:10:10.366
- [Emily] No, of course not.

01:10:11.133 --> 01:10:13.000
I'm so sorry, I--

01:10:13.033 --> 01:10:14.466
- [Andrew] Damn it, Em.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.033
- [Emily] Please,
I will be there.

01:10:16.066 --> 01:10:17.566
- [Andrew] Whatever, forget it.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.866
- [Emily] Andrew.
- [Andrew] Don't even bother.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.633
- [Emily] Andrew, please!

01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:22.500
Andrew please!

01:10:22.533 --> 01:10:23.966
Andrew!
[explosion]

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.366
- [Andrew] Emmy?

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.500
Emmy?

01:10:26.533 --> 01:10:27.600
Emily!

01:10:27.633 --> 01:10:28.666
- [Voiceover] If
you're just joining us,

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:29.733
we're live in downtown Detroit,

01:10:29.766 --> 01:10:32.966
where an explosion has
lead to a devastating fire

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.533
on the campus of
Cortland College.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.400
[sirens]

01:10:38.433 --> 01:10:40.866
[fire crackling]

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.133
- An explosion.

01:11:01.166 --> 01:11:02.733
- What else?

01:11:02.766 --> 01:11:05.000
You have to tell us
what else you remember.

01:11:05.033 --> 01:11:06.166
- He didn't make it.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.933
- Who didn't make it?

01:11:08.933 --> 01:11:10.533
- David.

01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:11.800
- Excellent.

01:11:11.833 --> 01:11:13.033
- There was...

01:11:14.466 --> 01:11:16.066
blood and... fire.

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.400
- We need to know what
he was working with.

01:11:18.433 --> 01:11:20.733
What it was he was doing.

01:11:20.766 --> 01:11:23.000
- I don't remember.

01:11:23.033 --> 01:11:24.200
His Hazel project.

01:11:24.233 --> 01:11:27.800
- Yes, exactly, and you were
consulting on that with him.

01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:29.666
- Why? Why does
any of this matter?

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.900
- Because whatever it was,

01:11:30.933 --> 01:11:32.600
whatever he was working with,

01:11:32.633 --> 01:11:34.066
it's what did this to you.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.033
It's what produced this virus.

01:11:36.066 --> 01:11:38.100
- What virus?
Andrew, what virus?

01:11:38.133 --> 01:11:39.933
- You tell us.

01:11:39.966 --> 01:11:42.466
You're the only one
who can, Doctor Burns.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.600
I'm sorry, but
without your knowledge

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.433
of what kind of viral
mutation could've

01:11:46.466 --> 01:11:48.100
taken place in this explosion,

01:11:48.933 --> 01:11:50.833
there's no hope of treating you.

01:11:50.866 --> 01:11:51.966
- I don't understand.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.800
- The marks on the
back of your neck.

01:11:54.833 --> 01:11:56.233
Burst blood vessels.

01:11:56.266 --> 01:11:58.033
The stiffness, the headaches,

01:11:58.066 --> 01:12:00.800
the motor function issues,
the loss of balance,

01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:03.033
hallucinations,
retrograde amnesia.

01:12:03.066 --> 01:12:05.933
My dear, it's all from the
inflammation of your brain.

01:12:06.966 --> 01:12:09.900
My dear, you have a
pathogen inside you.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.466
A viral mutation that science

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.866
has never seen up to this point.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.733
A viral mutation
that was created

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:18.900
in your laboratory,
Doctor Burns,

01:12:18.933 --> 01:12:20.733
using your inventory.

01:12:21.533 --> 01:12:24.100
In the experiment that you
consulted on with Doctor Cobb.

01:12:24.133 --> 01:12:26.900
Now, he's gone.

01:12:28.033 --> 01:12:29.900
So you're it.

01:12:29.933 --> 01:12:33.066
And each day we don't
identify this pathogen,

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.933
it will continue to
eat away at your body

01:12:36.966 --> 01:12:38.700
and your mind.

01:12:39.633 --> 01:12:41.633
Take a moment to
process all this,

01:12:41.666 --> 01:12:42.966
but let me stress again,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.933
time is very much
of the essence here.

01:12:48.066 --> 01:12:50.100
A substantial amount
of damage is being done

01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:53.066
on a daily basis to
your brain's MTL.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:56.800
Gradually, you're losing the
ability to create new memories.

01:12:56.833 --> 01:12:59.633
[solemn music]

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:00.966
In less than 30 minutes,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.200
all of us will still be
standing here the same,

01:13:02.233 --> 01:13:03.700
but for you,

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.766
it'll be January 3rd

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.066
all over again.

01:13:14.333 --> 01:13:15.833
We tried everything.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.700
Every test you can imagine.

01:13:18.733 --> 01:13:20.900
Every doctor, every medication.

01:13:21.966 --> 01:13:25.666
Herbal remedies,
psychoanalysis, dream analysis.

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:26.966
Nothing worked.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.266
- Doctor Burns you're suffering
from post-traumatic amnesia

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.633
and it's a malady I've treated
many times in my career,

01:13:33.666 --> 01:13:36.200
but for the most
severe of my patients,

01:13:36.233 --> 01:13:38.000
I provide this.

01:13:38.033 --> 01:13:42.066
An experimental,
highly-invasive therapy.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.200
I subject the patient to
a threatening scenario.

01:13:45.233 --> 01:13:48.766
This causes them to
become overwhelmed
with intense emotion.

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.166
Then at the same time,

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.700
I employ standard
psychoanalytical techniques.

01:13:54.733 --> 01:13:57.133
Music, video, photographs.

01:13:57.166 --> 01:14:00.933
Newscasts, anything that can
help us trick the amygdala,

01:14:00.966 --> 01:14:04.600
and help us pry loose
those hidden memories.

01:14:04.633 --> 01:14:06.300
- [Amanda] It's true Emily.

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.733
We're all here for you.

01:14:16.766 --> 01:14:19.633
- A complete and
utter fabrication.

01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:21.333
Done only with your input,

01:14:21.366 --> 01:14:24.666
and the help of your
family and your friends.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.166
- You made us swear
not to get involved.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.833
I'm so sorry.

01:14:28.866 --> 01:14:31.900
- Now now, there's no need
for any of us to be sorry,

01:14:31.933 --> 01:14:33.266
we're all in this together.

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.200
For Emily.

01:14:35.233 --> 01:14:37.033
So, we'd like to
welcome you to this,

01:14:37.066 --> 01:14:39.033
our fifth attempt.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.200
And I must say, we're
making splendid progress.

01:14:43.233 --> 01:14:45.633
But, I need more.

01:14:45.666 --> 01:14:47.033
I need you to go deeper

01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:49.733
into that mind of
yours Doctor Burns.

01:14:49.766 --> 01:14:52.300
And tell me everything,
every thing,

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.966
that you can about January 11th.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.000
I need to identify
this pathogen,

01:14:59.066 --> 01:15:01.366
before it takes you
over completely.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.900
- This can't be happening.

01:15:02.933 --> 01:15:04.133
- But it is.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.200
So think. Emily.

01:15:11.066 --> 01:15:12.633
[crying]

01:15:21.066 --> 01:15:22.200
- I don't know.

01:15:22.233 --> 01:15:24.700
- Honey, think.
- [Emily] I don't know!

01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:29.966
I'm so sorry.

01:15:31.733 --> 01:15:33.100
I am.

01:15:34.966 --> 01:15:36.033
- I know.

01:15:40.033 --> 01:15:42.000
- Mommy.

01:15:42.033 --> 01:15:43.866
[crying]

01:15:52.733 --> 01:15:54.100
It's okay.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.066
- No it's not baby.

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.033
It's gonna be okay, I'm
gonna figure this out, okay?

01:16:02.066 --> 01:16:03.433
This is what I do.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.166
You hear me?

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.166
I'm not going anywhere.

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:13.200
- Look at the
clock Doctor Burns.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.366
What is it you'd like to do?

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.166
- You know damn well
what I wanna do.

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.300
[snaps]

01:16:36.766 --> 01:16:39.000
[footsteps]

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.133
[grunting]

01:17:04.066 --> 01:17:06.066
