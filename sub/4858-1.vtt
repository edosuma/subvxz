Cody?

02:46.157 --> 02:47.657
Hey, Zach.

02:47.658 --> 02:49.159
What's up, Cody?

02:49.660 --> 02:51.078
Papi's sleeping.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.537
I can tell.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.291
- Don't play with these, ok?
- Ok.

02:56.417 --> 02:57.751
These are for grandpa.

02:58.753 --> 02:59.920
Ok!

03:00.880 --> 03:03.173
Dad, wake up.

03:04.717 --> 03:06.176
Wake up.

03:06.594 --> 03:08.095
Take these.

03:12.517 --> 03:14.267
Did you do your stretches today, dad?

03:20.191 --> 03:22.067
- Hey, Cody.
- Hey, Mom.

03:22.443 --> 03:23.860
How you doing, kiddo?

03:25.321 --> 03:26.947
Did you bring cigarettes?

03:28.282 --> 03:29.658
Yeah.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.203
Hey, Zach.

03:33.246 --> 03:34.413
What's up, sis?

03:34.455 --> 03:36.832
Change of plans.
Can you take Cody?

03:37.792 --> 03:39.543
I've got a shift and then I was
gonna go see Gabe

03:39.710 --> 03:40.627
before he leaves town.

03:40.795 --> 03:42.295
Yeah, but I gotta take dad
home and Allen called

03:42.422 --> 03:44.005
and I'm supposed to meet up
with him later.

03:45.466 --> 03:47.509
I could leave him with dad...

03:51.681 --> 03:53.723
Cody. Let's go for a ride.

03:54.475 --> 03:56.309
Thank you.
-Can I drive?

03:56.477 --> 03:57.811
- Come on dad, I'll give you a ride
back to Carol's.

03:57.979 --> 04:00.397
Sure, go get her started.

04:11.617 --> 04:13.118
Cody!

04:22.795 --> 04:23.962
Table 5!

04:24.172 --> 04:26.089
I told you. I can't close up today.

04:26.257 --> 04:27.757
Derell's not here yet.

04:28.092 --> 04:29.593
You're stuck, kid.

04:32.930 --> 04:35.265
This is a diner, Picasso.
Not the Louvre.

04:35.349 --> 04:36.641
Come on! People are waiting.

04:43.024 --> 04:44.441
Finally, man!
I gotta go.

04:44.775 --> 04:45.442
Sorry man.

04:45.693 --> 04:47.027
Cody, let's jet.

05:36.827 --> 05:37.994
Yo, Gabe!

05:43.876 --> 05:45.168
Hey hey, the Gabester!

05:45.336 --> 05:47.170
- Yo!
You're learning to skate I see.

05:47.338 --> 05:48.797
Fuck you. What up.
-What up.

05:49.382 --> 05:51.049
I've got Cody in the car so let's go.

05:51.259 --> 05:52.551
Baby on board, huh?

05:52.593 --> 05:54.636
- I'm taking you to the lot, right?
- Yeah, cool.

05:55.096 --> 05:56.555
Hey you should come up to S. B.

05:56.889 --> 05:59.474
You know, wouldn't hurt to get some
pussy you didn't have in high school.

06:01.269 --> 06:03.562
You and Tori broke it off, right?

06:04.105 --> 06:05.313
Sorta...

06:05.481 --> 06:06.982
- You know how it is.
- "Sort of"...

06:09.068 --> 06:10.360
Dude... he's five.

06:10.403 --> 06:11.653
He's sleeping.

06:11.696 --> 06:12.946
No I'm not!

06:13.281 --> 06:14.990
You are a sly one.

06:15.866 --> 06:17.826
Yeah he likes to pretend
he's sleeping.

06:17.994 --> 06:19.244
Go figure.

06:19.453 --> 06:21.329
That smells like Alan's cigarette.

06:21.622 --> 06:23.123
Who's Alan?

06:23.124 --> 06:24.666
Jeanne's boyfriend.

06:25.710 --> 06:26.918
Of the week...

06:27.837 --> 06:30.171
Dude, why don't you try and go to
Santa Barbara Community College?

06:30.339 --> 06:32.799
You can crash at our house until
you get your own place, you know?

06:32.967 --> 06:34.843
At least get the fuck out
of San Pedro.

06:35.344 --> 06:37.470
I don't think the whole student thing
is gonna happen right now.

06:37.638 --> 06:40.724
Why? Because you didn't get into that
Art Institute place?

06:40.808 --> 06:43.226
- Go somewhere else
- "Art Institute place"...

06:43.394 --> 06:45.020
Whatever, it's alright.

06:47.064 --> 06:48.732
That scholarship was my ticket...

06:48.899 --> 06:50.650
Well you are the king of scholarships.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.821
Got me into your ritchie rich
private school.

06:54.989 --> 06:56.531
On the short bus every day.

06:58.159 --> 06:58.825
Rich fuck.

06:58.951 --> 07:00.702
Fuck you, ghetto trash.

07:00.828 --> 07:02.203
You ever declare a major?

07:02.371 --> 07:04.539
Larry said I should go for
Communications.

07:04.957 --> 07:07.459
"Communications. "
What does that mean?

07:08.669 --> 07:10.003
It means I'm set, dude.

07:10.171 --> 07:12.464
Larry's gonna set me up with
something at his firm, you know,

07:12.673 --> 07:15.383
so I can go back and get some more
partying out of my system.

07:15.801 --> 07:19.471
Move back here, buy a couple suits.
Start making some real cash.

07:19.639 --> 07:22.015
You could have the same
life... if you wanted.

07:26.896 --> 07:27.687
Alright bro.

07:27.855 --> 07:29.606
Alright man. Come up and hang
out soon ok?

07:29.649 --> 07:30.315
Alright.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.858
No, I mean it this time, dude.

07:32.026 --> 07:33.860
You've been up once. That shit
ain't right.

07:34.528 --> 07:37.447
Look, I'll get you a plane ticket.
Or just get in the car and drive.

07:38.032 --> 07:39.324
- Cool?
- Ok.

07:40.076 --> 07:42.118
Code-man. Keep it real, playboy.

07:42.453 --> 07:44.579
- Promise?
- Yeah.

07:51.295 --> 07:52.545
Ok, ok, go...

07:52.713 --> 07:54.839
Gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee...

07:54.882 --> 07:56.633
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:58.469 --> 07:59.761
I'm gonna go out for a session.

08:00.137 --> 08:02.138
No, I thought you were staying.
I went shopping.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.474
And I invited Ellen over.

08:06.435 --> 08:07.394
What?

08:07.561 --> 08:09.729
You're an eligible bachelor, right?
That's what I heard.

08:09.897 --> 08:11.523
Not that you would ever tell me.

08:11.691 --> 08:12.941
Shh.

08:13.109 --> 08:15.026
You know, if you keep breaking
up with Tori like that,

08:15.069 --> 08:16.903
one of these times she's
not coming back.

08:17.363 --> 08:20.073
Jeanne, Jeanne, come in Jeanne.
Cody to Jeanne.

08:20.241 --> 08:22.784
Cody, I don't wanna play right now.
Just watch the TV, okay?

08:24.036 --> 08:24.828
Hey.

08:27.081 --> 08:29.499
Listen, I'm heading out, alright?
It's breaking hard.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.626

My mom used to work here
just like yours.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.020
So sometimes I would just
wait out here...

10:14.897 --> 10:16.272

10:34.959 --> 10:36.084
When?

10:36.252 --> 10:37.627
When you drew these.

10:40.798 --> 10:42.173
No one.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.092
What about Papi?

10:44.844 --> 10:47.804
Well, he was very hurt from when he
fell and hurt his back at work.

10:47.972 --> 10:49.556
He's your daddy.

10:49.557 --> 10:50.598
Yes.

10:50.641 --> 10:52.183
And you're my daddy.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.144
No, Cody. I'm your uncle.

10:55.521 --> 10:58.982
Your mommy is my sister.
That makes me your uncle.

10:59.358 --> 11:00.567
Roy's your daddy.

11:00.734 --> 11:02.485
Nope. You're my daddy.

11:02.820 --> 11:07.907
You're my daddy, you're my daddy.
You're my daddy, you're my daddy...

11:08.325 --> 11:11.119
Hey... keep drawing.

11:25.217 --> 11:26.426
Hey, Zach!

11:26.552 --> 11:28.052
What's up.

11:28.762 --> 11:30.471
Hey, Zach, you're staying in
tonight, right?

11:30.931 --> 11:31.639
Why?

11:31.807 --> 11:34.100
Alan's playing at the Landmine and
he put us on the guest list.

11:34.310 --> 11:36.102
Looks like you're the babysitter
tonight little brother.

11:36.312 --> 11:37.478
Guess so.

11:50.117 --> 11:51.618
Hello?

11:52.161 --> 11:53.161
Hey, monkey.

11:53.329 --> 11:54.787
Hey, what are you doing?

11:55.873 --> 11:56.706
Guess...

11:56.957 --> 11:58.291
Babysitting?

11:58.667 --> 11:59.751
Bingo!

12:00.002 --> 12:01.961
- Hey listen, can I call you back?
Where are you?

12:02.129 --> 12:05.089
Are you there? Zach?
I can't hear anything.

12:05.257 --> 12:07.467
- Uh, yeah.
- Hey, I'm losing you.

12:07.801 --> 12:10.136
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Can you hear me? Hello?

12:10.304 --> 12:13.306
Tori, I was thinking about you and...
- I'll meet you at Billy's.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.642
Hello?

12:56.642 --> 13:02.605
Jesus Christ! You fucking idiot...

13:04.817 --> 13:07.026
Oh my God... get the opener.

13:10.447 --> 13:11.948
Jeanne, what the fuck?!

13:12.241 --> 13:13.992
Shit, dad's mad.

13:15.536 --> 13:16.869
I just put him to bed.

13:17.037 --> 13:18.871
Oh come on, he can sleep
through everything.

13:22.376 --> 13:24.460
Just keep it down, alright?

13:26.046 --> 13:28.798
Did you get cigarettes?
Yeah, come here.

14:06.211 --> 14:09.088
I thought your ghetto ass would be
done breaking and entering by now.

14:09.256 --> 14:10.631
Change of code, bitch!

14:11.050 --> 14:13.092
What are you gonna tag
the garage next?

14:13.510 --> 14:15.636
That may not go over... you know.

14:16.305 --> 14:18.347
With the Pacific Bluff
homeowners agreement,

14:18.515 --> 14:20.892
wouldn't wanna set your dad in
trouble with the board.

14:21.143 --> 14:22.393
Step-dad.

14:26.315 --> 14:28.816
I left my longboard here.

14:29.443 --> 14:31.319
That's cool.
How you doing, man?

14:31.570 --> 14:32.862
Good, good, you know.

14:36.575 --> 14:37.950
So I haven't seen you since like
your graduation.

14:38.118 --> 14:38.868
What have you been up to?

14:39.495 --> 14:41.871
Nothing. Working, you know.
How about you?

14:42.081 --> 14:45.249
I'm just down for a few weeks.
House is empty, I could enjoy it.

14:45.459 --> 14:46.292
Clear my head a little bit.

14:46.460 --> 14:47.794
I thought you hated it down here?

14:48.462 --> 14:49.796
I miss the ocean.

14:50.631 --> 14:52.256
Dude, you live in L. A.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.133
I don't paddle out there.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.346
You wanna go?

14:59.389 --> 15:01.682
Surfing?
Uh... yeah.

15:05.479 --> 15:07.814
I suppose there's still a few things
I could teach you.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.608
You will soon learn, butterfly.

15:10.859 --> 15:13.444
Perhaps master underestimate student.

15:13.737 --> 15:15.404
Bring it on, city boy!

16:09.960 --> 16:11.586
Well, we picked a good time to
come out.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.462
Yeah, the tide's coming in.

16:13.630 --> 16:14.589
Yeah.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.632
Hey, where are you living now?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.426
With Jeannie in San Pedro.

16:18.969 --> 16:20.803
It's just for now, you know.

16:21.555 --> 16:23.639
I'm trying to save up to get my
own place.

16:23.807 --> 16:26.142
But you know, it's close to my dad
and work and stuff.

16:26.476 --> 16:28.603
Well you guys are welcome to come out
here anytime you want.

16:29.897 --> 16:31.731
Just like old times, huh?

16:31.940 --> 16:33.191
Minus Gabe.

16:33.442 --> 16:34.650
Right.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.152
Hey... you see him much?

16:36.320 --> 16:39.739
A bit. He came down last year
with some of his friends.

16:40.407 --> 16:41.824
Those guys like to party.

16:42.993 --> 16:44.577
You can say that again.

16:47.873 --> 16:49.457
How is Jeanne doing?

16:50.500 --> 16:53.252
You know, the same I guess?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.797
I try to help out as much as I can.

16:59.218 --> 17:01.302
I cannot see her as a mom.

17:06.098 --> 17:07.724
Cody must be getting big?

17:07.893 --> 17:12.063
Yeah, he's five already.
-Wow.

17:12.772 --> 17:15.273
It's crazy, you know.
Time just flies.

17:15.776 --> 17:18.527
Yep. Trust me, it only gets faster.

17:18.694 --> 17:19.945
Yeah, I bet.

17:25.868 --> 17:29.080
Hey, monkey!

17:32.251 --> 17:34.335
What's up?
What are you doing down here?

17:35.295 --> 17:37.380
Only place for dogs
and a fire on the beach.

17:37.547 --> 17:38.422
Yeah.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.216
Come down, grab a beer.

17:40.384 --> 17:42.551
Cool, I'll be down in a sec.
Alright.

17:49.268 --> 17:53.104
Hey, you wanna go grab a beer or do
you wanna just take off?

17:53.355 --> 17:55.606
Yeah, I'll grab a beer. Sounds good.
Cool.

17:59.319 --> 18:00.736
So who'd you come down with?

18:01.029 --> 18:02.530
Billy.

18:02.823 --> 18:04.115
Who is that?

18:04.741 --> 18:05.908
Shaun!

18:06.159 --> 18:07.868
Gabe's brother?
Yeah.

18:08.912 --> 18:11.872
He doesn't come back much.
He's been pretty MIA.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.041
It's nice to see you.

18:15.836 --> 18:18.671
Yeah, it's good to see you too.
Going long!

18:18.839 --> 18:22.008
Are you gonna play or are you just
gonna talk shit about me?

18:22.092 --> 18:23.259
Nice throw.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.760
I'm Tori.

18:24.928 --> 18:26.929
I remember you.
You were 13 and you had crimped hair,

18:27.097 --> 18:28.180
but I remember you.

18:28.348 --> 18:30.016
I bought you guys wine coolers.

18:31.643 --> 18:33.436
I think you puked on my
parents' deck.

18:33.895 --> 18:34.770
Wow.

18:35.689 --> 18:37.523
You're still putting up with
this guy's shit?

18:37.691 --> 18:39.525
Well, we're both still here.

18:40.527 --> 18:41.736
Right on.

19:00.589 --> 19:03.007
That's why you never tell a woman
how to cook a chicken.

19:04.051 --> 19:06.218
I can't believe you got shot
by a chick.

19:07.137 --> 19:10.681
Shaun, right?
Aren't you Gabe's bro?

19:11.099 --> 19:12.600
Yeah.

19:13.018 --> 19:15.770
Heard you went all Hollywood,
writing movies or something.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.688
Yeah, or something.

19:20.525 --> 19:23.652
What's the deal?
You're still with Tori then?

19:27.824 --> 19:30.743
Are you a fag?
I mean she's hot.

19:34.956 --> 19:37.541
So it's cool if I move in
on that then?

19:48.970 --> 19:50.679
The swell's coming in.

19:50.931 --> 19:52.640
Yeah it looks that way.

19:53.934 --> 19:56.936
Trip seeing Tori.
Yeah, I bet.

19:58.063 --> 20:00.189
You guys have been together for years.

20:01.691 --> 20:04.026
Yeah we're just taking a little break
right now.

20:06.947 --> 20:08.823
I mean, she's my best friend.

20:09.574 --> 20:10.908
Other than Gabe.

20:12.077 --> 20:13.411
It's all good.

20:13.703 --> 20:15.329
You dating anyone?

20:15.414 --> 20:17.039
No, I just broke up.

20:17.541 --> 20:20.376
Yeah? Is that why you're
really down here?

20:20.627 --> 20:22.378
No, no, no...

20:25.215 --> 20:27.508
Yeah, actally it is.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.177
I moved out of our place and, uh,

20:30.679 --> 20:32.972
my new lease doesn't start until
the end of the month.

20:33.557 --> 20:34.682
That's cool.

20:38.478 --> 20:39.687
I'm sorry.
-Mhm.

20:40.897 --> 20:42.398
Hello?

20:43.108 --> 20:45.109
I thought we weren't gonna leave
him over there.

20:46.403 --> 20:48.904
No, don't drive, Jeannie.

20:50.407 --> 20:51.907
I'll go get him.

20:52.868 --> 20:54.160
Yeah.

20:56.204 --> 20:57.371
I gotta go.

20:57.414 --> 20:58.456
Alright.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.291
Tori said she needs a ride so...

21:00.333 --> 21:02.710
That's cool, I'll catch a ride
from someone.

21:02.878 --> 21:04.086
It's cool. Great riding today.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.172
- Alright, man.
Yeah, it was good seeing you man.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.507
- Yeah it was fun.
- Ok cool.

21:40.290 --> 21:41.707
I'm gonna leave.

21:45.170 --> 21:46.378
Wait, come here...

21:46.546 --> 21:48.464
I'm tired. Goodnight.

22:01.311 --> 22:02.686
Did I write this shit?

22:04.481 --> 22:05.648
Oh my God.

22:40.308 --> 22:42.977
Hello! Hello! Is anyone out there?

22:43.144 --> 22:45.312
Hello. Is anyone out there?

22:51.820 --> 22:56.782
Hellooo... Shaun?

22:56.950 --> 22:57.908
Who the fuck is this?

22:57.951 --> 23:00.035
Master does not know his own student.

23:00.912 --> 23:04.873
Student is ashamed.
Master gets old.

23:06.293 --> 23:07.543
Where'd you find these?

23:07.794 --> 23:09.795
Dude, they were just laying
around the house.

23:09.963 --> 23:12.965
Man, Gabe and I used to stay up for
hours on these.

23:13.133 --> 23:15.843
I can't believe that these
go all the way to your house.

23:16.011 --> 23:18.137
All the way to the ghetto.

23:19.264 --> 23:21.432
They were the latest technology
back then.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.351
I think your dad bought them
for Gabe in an airport

23:24.519 --> 23:26.145
when he missed a Christmas one year.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.313
Step-dad.

23:27.772 --> 23:30.941
Yeah, I remember that year. I think
he got me a talking dart board.

23:32.068 --> 23:33.235
That sucks!

23:33.445 --> 23:37.323
Oh hey, I saw some of your tags today.
They're sweet.

23:37.616 --> 23:38.449
Yeah?

23:38.617 --> 23:41.744
Yeah, you've got that crane thing
going on; it looks cool.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.663
- Glad to see someone's doing
their artwork.

23:45.999 --> 23:47.875
Yeah, sometimes.

23:54.633 --> 23:58.302
It was, uh... .
It was nice riding out there today.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.095
Yeah.

24:02.682 --> 24:03.682
What's up?

24:03.850 --> 24:05.392
Your battery's probably gonna run out.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.519
Probably hasn't been replaced
in 10 years.

24:12.651 --> 24:13.984
What are you listening to?

24:14.319 --> 24:16.737
Um, nothing...

24:34.422 --> 24:36.590
He's a fighter. He's totally a
fighter.

24:41.304 --> 24:42.930
He's gonna kick his ass.

24:43.807 --> 24:45.099
One...

24:49.145 --> 24:50.604
But he wants to look good...

24:51.147 --> 24:52.564
kicking his ass.

24:56.820 --> 24:59.905
He's wearing a sweet suit,
and he's gonna kick his ass.

25:12.919 --> 25:13.711
Ha!

25:14.629 --> 25:17.005
Dude, it's breaking overhead.
Let's roll to the 'bu.

25:17.632 --> 25:18.924
I'm working.

25:19.926 --> 25:21.677
Really? That's too bad.

25:23.096 --> 25:24.555
Alright, see you later then.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.598
Alright! Hold on, I'll come.

25:27.642 --> 25:29.393
You might wanna change first.

25:32.188 --> 25:33.605
Come on dude, let's go!

25:41.531 --> 25:44.324
Oh, dude, it's a fucking circus
out there.

25:46.578 --> 25:48.120
I'll protect you from the big brewery.

25:48.288 --> 25:49.872
Go... I've got a better spot.
-Pussy!

25:50.457 --> 25:52.499
Better spot... Go.

25:54.085 --> 25:55.794
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

25:56.004 --> 25:57.838
The break looks good, man.

25:58.047 --> 25:59.840
- Just gotta figure out where the
road is.

26:00.717 --> 26:03.552
- Uhhhh... Oh right there!
Right there, right there!

26:06.014 --> 26:06.972
Careful.

26:07.140 --> 26:09.850
- Should've told me sooner.
- Sorry, sorry. Go.

26:17.776 --> 26:19.067
This is rad!

26:21.404 --> 26:23.989
Sorry I never told you and Gabe
about this place, man.

26:24.783 --> 26:27.075
I just didn't want it to turn into the
remnants

26:27.243 --> 26:28.744
of your keggers every Sunday morning.

26:29.245 --> 26:31.705
This is my place I used to come to get
away and think.

26:32.248 --> 26:34.792
- And surf?
- And surf.

26:34.959 --> 26:36.710
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

26:43.718 --> 26:46.136
So you still thinking about
applying to art school?

26:48.014 --> 26:49.431
I do street art now.

26:49.808 --> 26:50.974
It's cool though, you know.

26:51.059 --> 26:52.559
What are you working on?

26:52.602 --> 26:53.852
A book.

26:54.562 --> 26:58.649
Oh. What, it's been like, uh, 3 years
since the last one, right?

26:59.442 --> 27:01.276
- Is it really long or something?
- Fuck off.

27:01.444 --> 27:03.403
You sure didn't leave much out
of the last one.

27:04.656 --> 27:05.864
You read it?

27:06.032 --> 27:09.076
Who knew there'd be so much drama
inside the gates of Pacific Bluffs.

27:09.494 --> 27:10.702
I never knew.

27:11.746 --> 27:14.289
You never really know
what's happening inside.

27:14.624 --> 27:17.084
Yeah, that's what I liked about it.

27:18.336 --> 27:20.838
I did embellish a little bit;
it is fiction.

27:21.005 --> 27:22.464
You changed a couple of names?

27:22.882 --> 27:24.132
When did you read it?

27:24.175 --> 27:25.384
When it came out.

27:26.928 --> 27:28.637
Funny, Gabe never mentioned anything.

27:29.138 --> 27:30.764
I never told him.

27:31.599 --> 27:33.308
Why would he tell you?

27:35.353 --> 27:38.063
I just never knew that
you knew about me.

27:41.317 --> 27:42.776
What's your new one about?

27:44.279 --> 27:46.572
Uh, still trying to figure that out.

27:47.156 --> 27:48.657
Don't really have a subject yet.

27:49.617 --> 27:51.326
But, I'll get it back.

27:51.452 --> 27:52.661
I hope so.

27:53.830 --> 27:54.955
You're good.

27:56.291 --> 27:58.208
- You really liked it?
- Yeah.

28:01.087 --> 28:02.337
You hungry?

28:02.547 --> 28:05.215
Yeah, you wanna go to the shack
or something?

28:05.383 --> 28:06.383
Yeah, definitely.

28:07.093 --> 28:10.262
So, how long you staying around?

28:10.805 --> 28:12.514
I'm gonna be here for a while.

28:12.765 --> 28:14.433
I was supposed to go to Barcelona to

28:14.601 --> 28:17.269
meet a friend next month,
but I'm kinda broke.

28:17.645 --> 28:19.187
You should ask Larry for the cash.

28:19.355 --> 28:21.607
Ooh no, that's not my style.

28:24.277 --> 28:25.736
Have you ever been to Europe.

28:26.571 --> 28:28.405
I've been to Florida once.

28:28.615 --> 28:31.241
And that time your parents took
me to Mexico.

28:31.451 --> 28:33.452
- That's about it.
- That's right, that's right.

28:34.078 --> 28:36.163
- I don't travel much.
- You should go, man.

28:37.582 --> 28:38.916
I'd like to someday.

28:39.083 --> 28:41.418
I mean, just for the art.
-Yeah.

28:45.340 --> 28:46.298
Hmm.

28:46.841 --> 28:48.175
Go ahead, take it.

28:49.177 --> 28:50.677
Nah, it's cool.

28:51.763 --> 28:54.264
What? You guys like, in limbo
or something?

28:55.308 --> 28:56.725
Yeah, yeah...

28:57.518 --> 29:00.354
- I'm not good at that.
- Takes a little practice.

29:03.483 --> 29:05.567
And he drives right through
the stop sign.

29:05.735 --> 29:09.237
And out into some field.
He totally passed out.

29:09.322 --> 29:10.614
He must've been wasted, man.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.991
He was totally hammered.
He's a fucking idiot.

29:15.578 --> 29:17.996
But he's my brother.
And I love him.

29:18.206 --> 29:19.790
And my best friend.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.208
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

29:23.586 --> 29:25.045
I'm gonna get another... you?

29:25.171 --> 29:26.463
- Mhmm, Ok.
- Alright.

29:45.066 --> 29:46.149
Here you go...

29:46.526 --> 29:47.609
Thanks, brother.

29:47.777 --> 29:49.778
- Wow.
- Woah... what are you doing?

29:49.946 --> 29:53.031
Easy dude, it's ok.
I wanna look at it.

29:53.199 --> 29:54.908
No one ever looks at that.

30:08.131 --> 30:09.506
Wow, is that Cody?

30:11.801 --> 30:12.676
Yeah.

30:15.930 --> 30:17.305
A sad Cody.

30:20.601 --> 30:21.727
You could tell?

30:21.769 --> 30:23.854
Yeah. And how you darkened it
around his head.

30:24.355 --> 30:25.647
This is incredible.

30:27.483 --> 30:29.526
And there's no toys in his room.

30:31.529 --> 30:32.404
Wow.

30:36.743 --> 30:37.826
It's awesome.

30:41.873 --> 30:46.585
Yeah, he'd just gotten scolded.
He was trying to understand why...

30:48.337 --> 30:50.047
So he came into my room.

30:53.259 --> 30:55.719
He hasn't left yet.
It's the only place he could sleep.

30:58.014 --> 30:59.097
Ok, enough.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.113
Ow, ho ho, ow.

31:15.281 --> 31:16.031
Ow!

31:16.199 --> 31:17.532
Adam's apple.

31:20.995 --> 31:24.081
- I'm trashed.
- The cops are definitely coming.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.175
Shit!

32:41.951 --> 32:42.951
What? You'll make it.

32:42.952 --> 32:44.286
Cody, let's go.

32:45.621 --> 32:46.580
Where were you?

32:46.622 --> 32:47.789
- Surfing.
- All night?

32:47.957 --> 32:49.249
Yeah, what the fuck?

32:50.168 --> 32:51.209
I'm just asking.

32:51.377 --> 32:52.627
- Want a ride or not?
- Go.

32:52.712 --> 32:53.837
Cody, let's go!

32:57.592 --> 32:59.509
I think I should reapply
to CalArts...

32:59.510 --> 33:00.594
What's CalArts?

33:00.636 --> 33:02.012
It's a school, buddy.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.973
- I get to go to school next year.
- Yep.

33:05.266 --> 33:06.766
They already turned you down.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.227
What made you think of that?

33:09.228 --> 33:10.604
It's just a thought.

33:12.565 --> 33:13.899
Well don't get your hopes up.

33:15.568 --> 33:19.112
I mean we're having a hard time, Zach.
I don't need you getting all down.

33:19.447 --> 33:20.447
Yeah...

33:21.782 --> 33:24.951
Alan paints houses. Maybe I can see if
he can hook you up with a job.

33:29.081 --> 33:29.915
Ooh.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.292
You're heavy.

33:35.922 --> 33:36.796
Come on.

33:39.050 --> 33:41.301
- I'll be right in.
- Alright, hurry up.

33:41.469 --> 33:42.677
Hey, monkey.

33:43.554 --> 33:44.721
Hey.

33:47.767 --> 33:49.142
I'm late.

35:28.617 --> 35:30.118
Hey.

35:30.119 --> 35:31.619
Oh hey.

35:31.787 --> 35:33.663
I hear you've been hanging
out with Shaun.

35:34.874 --> 35:36.374
Surfing.

35:36.417 --> 35:37.917
Well you know about him, right?

35:38.044 --> 35:39.252
What about him?

35:40.171 --> 35:41.504
He's gay.

35:41.672 --> 35:44.466
He's an old friend, Jeanne. We've been
surfing together since I was 8.

35:44.550 --> 35:45.717
Yeah, well is that all?

35:45.801 --> 35:48.094
Yeah, what are you saying?

35:48.346 --> 35:49.846
- Nothing.
- Good.

35:51.390 --> 35:53.725
Zach, I just don't think that he's

35:53.893 --> 35:56.895
the best guy to be hanging out with
all day half-naked...

35:57.104 --> 36:00.106
if you know what I mean.
And I don't want Cody around that.

36:00.274 --> 36:01.983
What? Why?

36:04.403 --> 36:05.945
I'm late. Get out.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.155
Fine.

36:20.586 --> 36:22.420
Zach, you're not a fag, right?

36:22.797 --> 36:23.713
Jeanne...

36:23.881 --> 36:26.091
Wait, you never tell me anything.
How am I supposed to know?

36:26.092 --> 36:27.425
What do you think?

36:28.344 --> 36:30.136
I think I don't wanna deal with that.

36:52.868 --> 36:54.369
Hi dude.

36:54.829 --> 36:56.663
- I tried calling you.
- Yeah.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.584
- Listen, I just wanted to...
- Yeah, I've been really busy, man.

37:02.586 --> 37:05.422
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Yeah, I know.

37:06.590 --> 37:08.800
- Listen, man...
- Just drop it, dude.

37:11.470 --> 37:12.637
Ok.

37:19.478 --> 37:20.728
Hey, Shaun.

37:21.188 --> 37:23.231
Hey. What's up?

37:23.566 --> 37:24.899
I need help!

37:24.942 --> 37:26.401
Shaun, this is Cody.

37:27.069 --> 37:28.736
Hi Cody, how are you, man?
I'm Shaun.

37:28.779 --> 37:29.821
I need help.

37:29.822 --> 37:31.156
You need help?

37:32.491 --> 37:34.367
Uhh, alright...

37:35.619 --> 37:37.328
But, dude you've got it all wrong.

37:37.830 --> 37:41.374
See, you've gotta fortify the corners
of the moat first.

37:41.584 --> 37:43.126
"Fourty-fi"?

37:43.294 --> 37:45.211
Codes, let's go.

37:45.421 --> 37:48.339
I'm not done; I have to "fourty-fi"!

37:49.300 --> 37:51.342
Shaun, do you mind looking after
Cody for a second?

37:51.802 --> 37:52.969
We're cool.

37:53.554 --> 37:54.721
Let's go for a walk.

37:55.014 --> 37:56.514
No, I don't think I should leave Cody.

37:56.640 --> 37:57.849
Come on, Shaun can watch him.

37:59.310 --> 38:01.519
You guys go, it's fine.

38:04.565 --> 38:05.815
Alright.

38:06.192 --> 38:07.358
There we go.

38:07.526 --> 38:10.695
This is gonna be a sweet walking
bridge. Oh look at that!

38:14.617 --> 38:16.409
Shaun's great with Cody.

38:20.581 --> 38:22.540
Listen, I'm sorry about the other day.

38:26.045 --> 38:27.462
It was stupid.

38:28.506 --> 38:30.298
Just make up your mind, Zach.

38:31.133 --> 38:34.761
If you don't want to be together then
just don't pull that shit on me.

38:37.973 --> 38:39.098
Ok.

38:41.602 --> 38:44.187
If it's what you want then
I'm gonna move on.

38:46.565 --> 38:47.649
Alright.

38:48.984 --> 38:50.777
You know what that means, right?

38:51.570 --> 38:53.655
Yeah, Tori. I know what that means.

38:54.865 --> 38:55.990
Just go, ok?

39:00.079 --> 39:01.621
Come on, Cody.
Time to go.

39:01.789 --> 39:03.081
Five more minutes.

39:03.249 --> 39:04.040
Shaun rocks.

39:04.083 --> 39:05.625
No, Cody. Let's go.

39:05.876 --> 39:07.085
Shaun rocks!

39:08.003 --> 39:09.796
Can I jump on the sand castle?

39:10.005 --> 39:11.214
No, we gotta go. Come on.

39:11.382 --> 39:14.509
Hey, the tide's gonna get it anyway.
You might as well let him have at it.

39:15.761 --> 39:17.011
Go ahead.

39:17.179 --> 39:19.389
- Woo!
- Weehaa!

39:23.519 --> 39:25.103
Alright man, great job!

39:26.397 --> 39:27.814
Come on, little man.

39:28.315 --> 39:29.357
Sayonara.

39:30.150 --> 39:33.152
Hey, I just wanted to talk
to you about the other night.

39:35.197 --> 39:36.281
What?

39:36.448 --> 39:39.909
I think you're really talented. And I
don't think you should throw it away.

39:40.077 --> 39:41.452
I think you should do something
with it.

39:41.537 --> 39:42.620
Is that it?

39:44.873 --> 39:45.873
Yeah.

39:46.959 --> 39:48.126
I'm late.

39:59.096 --> 39:59.887
Tori, I'll call...

42:16.984 --> 42:18.109
Good morning.

42:20.028 --> 42:21.237
What time is it?

42:24.533 --> 42:26.159
Why? You got somewhere to go?

42:26.744 --> 42:30.204
Yeah. Yeah I gotta go.

42:31.582 --> 42:33.082
Wait.

42:34.793 --> 42:36.711
Listen, I gotta go.

43:20.589 --> 43:22.840
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hey.

43:26.261 --> 43:27.512
Where's Cody?

43:27.679 --> 43:29.222
Like you care.

43:29.389 --> 43:30.848
What are you talking about?

43:31.058 --> 43:33.434
Where were you last night?
I called you like 3 times.

43:33.685 --> 43:34.852
Did you need something?

43:35.020 --> 43:37.688
Yeah. I need to know you're there.

43:37.856 --> 43:39.565
I'm always there. For Cody.

43:39.817 --> 43:41.192
You weren't last night.

43:44.488 --> 43:45.863
What do you need, Jeannie?

43:48.283 --> 43:50.785
Actually, Alan is going up
to Portland this weekend.

43:50.953 --> 43:53.871
And um, he's gonna make a bid on a
job. He said he'd take me.

43:54.748 --> 43:56.791
It would do me so much good
to get out of here.

43:57.417 --> 43:59.043
- Alan?
- Yeah.

44:00.254 --> 44:02.922
- Alan?
- Uh huh.

44:04.299 --> 44:06.551
Can you watch Cody this weekend?
Please...

44:07.135 --> 44:09.762
You know, I was hoping to have
the weekend to myself.

44:09.805 --> 44:11.055
Why?

44:11.640 --> 44:13.349
Who are you fucking?

44:13.517 --> 44:15.142
What? What are you talking about?

44:15.352 --> 44:18.062
Come on, I saw you gazing out the
window.

44:18.105 --> 44:19.856
I know it's not Tori.
Who is it?

44:21.191 --> 44:22.358
Nobody?

44:23.485 --> 44:25.069
Well I guess you're free then.

44:27.281 --> 44:29.031
Come on, Zach. You're all I've got.

44:30.242 --> 44:31.325
I know.

44:43.005 --> 44:43.921
Hey.

44:44.089 --> 44:45.798
Hey. Everything cool?

44:47.134 --> 44:48.676
Yeah, yeah...

44:49.553 --> 44:51.679
Uh, what are you doin'?

44:52.306 --> 44:53.639
Going to work.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.810
- Come on over tonight. I'll cook
steaks.

44:58.979 --> 45:01.314
Uh... I can't.

45:01.481 --> 45:03.608
Come on. I'll make margaritas.

45:03.859 --> 45:05.192
Strong ones.

45:07.195 --> 45:08.279
Who is that?

45:08.530 --> 45:09.614
No one.

45:10.324 --> 45:11.449
Hold on.

45:11.867 --> 45:13.242
So you can do it, right?

45:13.827 --> 45:15.328
I gotta tell Alan.

45:19.708 --> 45:21.375
Fine.
-Cool, thanks.

45:26.590 --> 45:28.090
Shaun, I can't.

45:28.258 --> 45:29.383
Why?

45:29.593 --> 45:32.261
Jeannie's leaving for the weekend
and I gotta watch Cody.

45:32.304 --> 45:33.679
- So bring him.
No.

45:33.972 --> 45:35.097
Why not?

45:37.893 --> 45:39.393
You don't care?

45:39.561 --> 45:41.187
No! That kid's great.

45:41.355 --> 45:42.813
He says some funny shit.

45:43.148 --> 45:45.191
Look, I'm turning the grill on at 8.

45:48.654 --> 45:49.695
Ok.

45:55.869 --> 45:56.953
Come on, dude.

46:03.210 --> 46:05.044
I like these!
I like these!

46:07.089 --> 46:08.923
Nah, you don't want those.

46:13.261 --> 46:14.845
I think you should get these.

46:15.013 --> 46:16.305
But I want real shoes.

46:16.348 --> 46:17.682
But these are way cooler.

46:18.809 --> 46:19.809
Ok.

46:20.227 --> 46:21.727
Alright, let's go.

46:27.275 --> 46:30.194
Hey! Ankle biter!
What's up man, how are ya?

46:30.529 --> 46:33.030
Are you hungry?

46:33.198 --> 46:34.365
Starving!

46:34.533 --> 46:36.367
Starvin'? What do you want
for dinner?

46:37.160 --> 46:38.703
Hey, he'll eat whatever.

46:38.870 --> 46:40.579
I don't think I was asking him, was I?

46:40.622 --> 46:42.623
- No.
- No, I don't think so.

46:42.791 --> 46:43.541
No.

46:44.459 --> 46:45.876
Cold ones are in the fridge.

46:46.044 --> 46:47.128
What are you drinking?

46:47.295 --> 46:49.797
Red. Larry had this sick bottle
in the cellar.

46:50.007 --> 46:50.923
I'll try that.

46:51.091 --> 46:52.091
Alright, cool.

46:53.510 --> 46:55.302
Alright, buddy. Lay it on me.

46:55.470 --> 46:56.887
Whatcha gonna have for
dinner tonight?

46:57.055 --> 46:58.597
Uh, Mac and Cheese...

46:58.849 --> 46:59.598
Ok.

47:00.225 --> 47:01.517
Hot dog.

47:01.560 --> 47:02.768
Hot dogs?

47:02.936 --> 47:08.065
And, um, pancakes with...

47:08.233 --> 47:09.775
- Ok!
Chocolate chips.

47:09.818 --> 47:10.901
Chocolate chips? Ok!

47:11.069 --> 47:12.319
and no vegetables.

47:12.487 --> 47:14.572
No vegetables?
Are you sure?

47:15.699 --> 47:16.741
Sure, sure?

47:17.242 --> 47:18.701
Ok. Alright, buddy.

47:18.869 --> 47:20.327
I want you to do me a favor...

47:20.370 --> 47:21.537
Go look out at the ocean.

47:21.788 --> 47:24.832
Beautiful waves coming in right now.
I'm gonna make your dinner.

47:25.042 --> 47:25.833
Somehow.

47:26.376 --> 47:29.879
- Are we still in California?
- Yeah, buddy.

47:31.256 --> 47:32.840
Where are you going?

47:33.592 --> 47:36.135
I don't think we have that stuff
in the house.

47:36.386 --> 47:39.263
Seriously, dude. Don't worry about it.
-No, I want to. I want to.

47:39.431 --> 47:41.182
Little kids are supposed to
be spoiled.

47:41.349 --> 47:43.934
Besides, I'll be back in like five
minutes, ok?

47:44.561 --> 47:46.145
I'm gonna go check on him.

47:50.484 --> 47:53.110
- Where did Jeanne say she was going?
- She's going to Oregon.

47:53.278 --> 47:55.780
She thinks there's some job
up there worth checking out.

47:57.657 --> 47:59.450
I admire what you're doing for Cody.

48:00.202 --> 48:01.535
You don't have to.

48:03.163 --> 48:05.372
Yeah. I do.

48:06.750 --> 48:08.125
It's a choice, Zach.

48:10.170 --> 48:11.295
It's family.

48:12.756 --> 48:14.340
I'm the only one left.

48:17.636 --> 48:19.678
You get that from your mom.

48:21.181 --> 48:25.309
Yeah, I know... Lucky me.

48:35.445 --> 48:36.570
Come here.

48:36.822 --> 48:37.613
What?

48:37.781 --> 48:38.823
Come here.

48:40.242 --> 48:41.325
I need to go check...

48:41.493 --> 48:44.870
He's fine. He's asleep. He's ok.

48:46.414 --> 48:47.498
Just come here.

49:05.517 --> 49:07.309
You sure you guys don't wanna stay?

49:07.310 --> 49:09.395
He doesn't like waking up in
strange places.

49:09.521 --> 49:11.355
Gets enough of that when I'm
not around.

49:11.982 --> 49:14.066
Ok. Take this.

49:14.317 --> 49:15.401
What is it?

49:15.944 --> 49:17.444
CalArts application.

49:17.654 --> 49:20.114
Shaun, I'm not going down this
road again.

49:20.157 --> 49:21.198
Take it.

49:25.412 --> 49:26.787
Thanks for tonight.

49:27.581 --> 49:28.914
Goodnight.

I'm pretty happy here.

52:17.375 --> 52:18.334
Yeah.

52:20.795 --> 52:22.796
Hey... why don't you come with me?

52:23.923 --> 52:25.049
Yeah, right.

52:25.425 --> 52:26.717
I'm serious.

52:29.304 --> 52:32.931
You could come with me.
I live right near CalArts.

52:42.525 --> 52:43.859
You're so beautiful.

52:44.110 --> 52:45.402
Shut up!

52:46.946 --> 52:48.739
Hey, learn to take a compliment.

52:55.413 --> 52:56.455
Thanks.

52:57.665 --> 52:59.291
So glad you're here.

52:59.959 --> 53:01.043
Me too.

53:04.672 --> 53:06.048
Yo, bro. What do you know!

53:06.132 --> 53:07.049
Gabe!

53:07.217 --> 53:08.675
Come on, come on!

53:08.718 --> 53:10.177
Shaunypoo!

53:10.345 --> 53:12.679
Hurry, hurry, go!
-Your little brother Gabe's back!

53:15.058 --> 53:17.309
Where's my princess big brother?

53:18.311 --> 53:20.562
What? You got a guy in there you slut?

53:20.939 --> 53:21.980
No!

53:22.273 --> 53:23.857
Ooohh, a girl?

53:24.025 --> 53:24.817
Yeah, right!

53:27.070 --> 53:28.946
Did I interrupt your beating off,
or what?

53:29.114 --> 53:30.114
No, I was sleeping.

53:30.281 --> 53:31.281
- Sleeping?
- Yes.

53:31.491 --> 53:33.659
With the door locked?
Ok, weirdo...

53:33.827 --> 53:35.369
No, hey, come here dude!

53:35.912 --> 53:39.540
- Good to see you too, bro.
- I missed you so much.

53:39.707 --> 53:41.417
There it is, yeah. Arrgh.

53:41.876 --> 53:43.168
Arrrr.

53:44.170 --> 53:45.754
Dude, so what are you doing here, man?

53:45.880 --> 53:47.714
I thought you were moving into
your new place this week.

53:47.882 --> 53:49.550
No, no. You know, the thought of...

53:50.427 --> 53:53.220
moving into an empty place is
just depressing, you know?

53:53.388 --> 53:56.390
Yeah? Well it's pretty empty here.

53:56.516 --> 53:57.599
You doing alright?

53:57.642 --> 53:58.642
Yeah, I'm good.

53:58.810 --> 53:59.643
- You sure?
- Mhmm.

53:59.811 --> 54:01.353
Yeah, I heard it was pretty tough
there for a while.

54:01.604 --> 54:03.439
Yeah, it was tough.

54:03.731 --> 54:05.941
Well don't worry, Romeo.
You'll find a new one.

54:06.109 --> 54:08.569
Yeah, thanks.

54:08.736 --> 54:10.487
So, you ready to hang up your
pink Gucci suit

54:10.530 --> 54:11.738
and come pal out with
your real friends?

54:11.823 --> 54:12.531
Yeah, ok.

54:12.699 --> 54:14.199
Right on, I'll call Zach.

54:14.367 --> 54:16.201
Ok, good, yeah.|

54:16.995 --> 54:18.245
What was that?

54:19.456 --> 54:21.165
June's probably cleaning today.

54:21.958 --> 54:24.543
But June comes on Tuesdays.

54:25.253 --> 54:26.420
Yes she does.

54:27.547 --> 54:29.339
Pool guy? I dunno.

54:31.926 --> 54:33.260
- You ok?
- Yeah.

54:33.428 --> 54:34.720
Yeah? You look a bit freaked out.

54:34.888 --> 54:35.846
No, I'm just tired.

54:36.264 --> 54:37.306
- Alright.
- Just tired.

54:37.515 --> 54:39.641
There anything good to eat in the
fridge or is it stocked with low-carb

54:39.767 --> 54:41.643
fag food? I'm fucking
starving man.

54:41.895 --> 54:43.687
Just a lot of fag food.

54:47.775 --> 54:49.151
Yo, burger boy!

54:49.777 --> 54:50.819
What up?

54:53.573 --> 54:55.365
What are you doing down here?

54:55.533 --> 54:58.577
Cherie's back in town for the weekend.
Told her I'd come down.

54:59.746 --> 55:00.412
Oh yeah?

55:00.580 --> 55:02.664
I thought there's plenty of
pussy in S. B.

55:02.832 --> 55:05.292
Oh yeah. But the girls there
are fucking teases man.

55:06.002 --> 55:07.836
Whatever. Party's on for tonight.

55:07.879 --> 55:09.004
Everyone's coming.

55:09.047 --> 55:10.631
We'll go grab a quick surf sesh...

55:10.673 --> 55:11.840
and get started.

55:12.133 --> 55:14.009
Uh, I'm not off for another half hour.

55:14.302 --> 55:16.470
No worries. I already fixed your
spare board.

55:16.638 --> 55:17.304
Huh?

55:17.472 --> 55:18.805
The one you've been keeping at
the house.

55:18.973 --> 55:22.476
I saw it out back and I fixed it.
Grabbed it, patched it all up...

55:24.354 --> 55:28.524
Oh yeah, yeah... that board.
Man, I left that there a while ago.

55:28.775 --> 55:31.026
Whatever. So I'll see you around
five at mine?

55:31.194 --> 55:32.945
- Ok.
- Alright, cool.

55:33.905 --> 55:35.447
Nice shirt, by the way.

55:47.752 --> 55:49.169
Dude, so what's the latest?

55:49.629 --> 55:51.672
You and Tori really over
this time?

55:53.258 --> 55:54.091
Yeah.

55:54.259 --> 55:56.802
Glad to hear it. It's about time.

55:57.053 --> 55:59.346
So what are you doing then?
Just playing the field?

56:00.515 --> 56:03.100
I talked to a bunch of people and
no one sees you anywhere.

56:03.226 --> 56:04.518
Everyone's gone man.

56:05.979 --> 56:07.145
Yo, there he is!

56:07.855 --> 56:10.065
Hey, you lasted pretty long out
there, old man.

56:13.486 --> 56:15.904
My big bro on a longboard.

56:16.281 --> 56:17.823
Never thought I'd see the day.

56:17.991 --> 56:21.410
Yeah, Give me 10 years and call me
back about that.

56:22.078 --> 56:25.080
Yeah, right. I'll never be on a
longboard. Ever.

56:25.748 --> 56:27.416
Alright, I'm getting beers.

56:31.462 --> 56:32.546
What's up, babe?

56:32.714 --> 56:33.880
Shaun, what...

56:36.593 --> 56:38.010
Shaun, just chill.

56:57.655 --> 56:58.780
Hey, Codes.

57:03.786 --> 57:05.245
What's wrong?

57:05.913 --> 57:07.456
Cody, go to your room for a second.

57:18.176 --> 57:20.886
Please tell me that he is
just confused.

57:21.137 --> 57:22.262
What do you mean?

57:22.680 --> 57:24.014
Zach, why didn't you tell me?

57:24.223 --> 57:25.265
Tell you what?

57:27.060 --> 57:29.853
Ok, your confusion is one thing...

57:30.146 --> 57:33.148
But bringing Cody into this is just
totally fucked.

57:33.316 --> 57:35.651
- I didn't bring him to anything.
- You brought him to Shaun!

57:35.818 --> 57:37.903
He likes Shaun! Shaun's better than...

57:38.071 --> 57:40.656
You know what, forget it. It's not
about Shaun, it's about us.

57:41.574 --> 57:43.241
It is about our family.

57:43.785 --> 57:45.077
What about it?

57:45.328 --> 57:49.706
Cody lost his father; He needs you.
He needs a positive man in his life.

57:49.999 --> 57:51.541
Well I'm sorry I'm no Alan.

57:52.460 --> 57:55.545
You don't know shit. Ok.
He's a little kid.

57:56.756 --> 57:58.840
He's not gonna understand this.

57:59.008 --> 58:00.926
You're mother of the fucking year now?

58:01.094 --> 58:03.929
- Oh fuck you.
- He'd be lost without me!

58:03.971 --> 58:04.930
Fuck you, Zach!

58:05.098 --> 58:07.182
Zach, are you trying to fuck up
our family?

58:07.350 --> 58:09.643
Yeah, yeah Jeannie. That's what I'm
trying to do.

58:09.811 --> 58:12.396
You know, Cody has a sense of family
because of me.

58:12.980 --> 58:15.190
Mom died and I got the family
fucking gene.

58:15.358 --> 58:17.025
Oh, I see. So it's the 'family' gene

58:17.193 --> 58:19.778
that's making you run off and
have your big gay wedding?

58:20.822 --> 58:22.906
You gonna make the family proud?

58:23.950 --> 58:25.283
Is that what you're scared of?

58:25.535 --> 58:28.829
This isn't about Shaun, or me.

58:30.164 --> 58:31.915
This is about you being left.

58:32.083 --> 58:34.710
You know, I'm the only one who
hasn't run off on you.

58:36.963 --> 58:38.296
That's sweet.

58:39.757 --> 58:41.717
But go ahead, judge me.

58:41.884 --> 58:43.927
I don't care. You know, you're right.

58:44.095 --> 58:46.012
Ok fine. Yeah, guys have left me.

58:46.264 --> 58:50.809
But, Zach, now you are just a
Summer fuck, ok?

58:51.352 --> 58:53.729
You've reduced yourself to a little
piece of ass.

58:53.896 --> 58:57.107
So bravo! You are doing really
well for yourself.

58:57.275 --> 58:59.818
Do you think that is a good
upbringing for him?

59:00.611 --> 59:02.112
- Yes.
- Do you?

59:02.280 --> 59:04.030
No, I don't know. I don't know.

59:04.198 --> 59:07.325
Well... if it is, do you think you'd
have to hide it from me?

59:07.368 --> 59:08.744
From Gabe? From Tori?

59:08.911 --> 59:11.413
I don't know!
I don't fucking know, ok?

59:15.168 --> 59:17.043
I just want what's best for Cody.

59:19.505 --> 59:21.256
Well, so do I!

59:27.221 --> 59:28.555
Sorry.

01:00:13.684 --> 01:00:15.060
Oh God.

01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:18.897
Hey.

01:00:25.947 --> 01:00:27.447
I need some time.

01:00:29.283 --> 01:00:31.535
I just don't know if this
is really what I want.

01:00:32.578 --> 01:00:34.204
It seems like what you want.

01:00:35.915 --> 01:00:37.791
I just don't know if this
is what I want.

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.043
For good.

01:00:43.089 --> 01:00:44.923
What's that supposed to mean?

01:00:45.132 --> 01:00:47.217
It's not as easy for me as it is
for you.

01:00:47.552 --> 01:00:49.928
You know, this is all totally
new to me.

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.805
Look, we'll get through
the Gabe thing...

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:52.973
No it's not that, Shaun.

01:00:53.015 --> 01:00:54.266
You just don't get it, ok?

01:00:54.433 --> 01:00:57.185
I can't just take whatever I want.
My life is not like that.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.729
You'll never get what you want
unless you take it.

01:00:59.814 --> 01:01:00.897
Take it...

01:01:01.065 --> 01:01:03.900
You know, You and Gabe have always
been able to point and take,

01:01:04.068 --> 01:01:05.151
no questions asked.

01:01:05.444 --> 01:01:07.821
You don't realize it's not like that
for other people.

01:01:07.989 --> 01:01:08.822
It's fucking ignorant!

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:10.782
Oh and you and Jeanne just blame
everyone else

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:12.909
because you can't do anything for
yourselves?

01:01:13.035 --> 01:01:14.369
What do you call that?

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.421
Look... fuck!

01:01:25.298 --> 01:01:26.840
Why are you doing this?

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:30.552
Don't get all emotional and faggy
on me, ok?

01:01:30.636 --> 01:01:31.469
What?

01:01:34.056 --> 01:01:36.516
I'm sick of being your childhood
wet dream, Shaun.

01:01:37.518 --> 01:01:39.436
Find another fucking fantasy!

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.354
You know what, you're a
fucking coward!

01:01:41.606 --> 01:01:42.480
I'm done.

01:01:42.648 --> 01:01:43.857
You're a fucking coward.

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.317
I'm done.

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:46.693
Get out!

01:02:10.384 --> 01:02:11.635
We're closed!

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:19.142
What's up, bro?

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:20.602
Good, brother.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.897
Fuck, I'm so hungover...

01:02:24.649 --> 01:02:26.983
Kitchen's closed.
Do you want a coffee?

01:02:27.193 --> 01:02:28.568
Yes, please.

01:02:30.196 --> 01:02:31.321
So what's up?

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:35.951
I'm taking off later today.
Never saw you leave last night.

01:02:39.997 --> 01:02:43.041
- So...
- So?

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.213
Why didn't you tell me?

01:02:49.674 --> 01:02:50.840
Tell you what?

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.762
I don't care... at all.

01:02:57.098 --> 01:02:58.974
I don't know what you're
talking about.

01:03:03.145 --> 01:03:05.480
Have you, have you always known?

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:06.648
Seriously, dude.

01:03:12.113 --> 01:03:13.154
Ok.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.243
The fact that it's my brother is
totally weird.

01:03:19.453 --> 01:03:20.453
I know.

01:03:20.621 --> 01:03:21.621
No, like...

01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:23.623
really really fucking weird.

01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:25.917
Alright, I got it.
I'm sorry.

01:03:27.962 --> 01:03:29.254
Don't be sorry.

01:03:29.547 --> 01:03:31.214
Don't tell anyone, ok?

01:03:32.383 --> 01:03:33.383
Ok.

01:03:35.052 --> 01:03:36.511
So are you going with other guys?

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:37.387
No!

01:03:37.972 --> 01:03:40.390
I heard they give better head.
They give better head, don't they?

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:41.307
Dude, stop!

01:03:41.475 --> 01:03:42.934
- They swallow?
- Gabe!

01:03:46.814 --> 01:03:48.064
Do you think he's hot?

01:03:48.232 --> 01:03:49.816
Shut the fuck up, dude!

01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:51.192
Fine.

01:03:56.115 --> 01:04:00.660
- So, where'd you go last night?
- I slept in my car.

01:04:00.828 --> 01:04:02.662
Why didn't you just crash at mine?

01:04:04.165 --> 01:04:05.915
This doesn't have to change things.

01:04:06.667 --> 01:04:09.836
Doesn't change things? Yeah, you're
right, Gabe.

01:04:10.337 --> 01:04:12.881
I used to be the guy you came and
talked to, remember?

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:13.757
Before Shaun.

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.217
This isn't exactly easy on me.

01:04:16.802 --> 01:04:18.970
It isn't easy on you, right?

01:04:19.972 --> 01:04:23.016
You know what? It's over anyways.
Just leave it, dude.

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:25.977
I've gotta clean up and
you've gotta leave.

01:04:38.449 --> 01:04:40.116
Hey, we're still bros, alright?

01:04:40.284 --> 01:04:41.367
I mean it.

01:04:43.245 --> 01:04:44.287
Come here.

01:05:50.938 --> 01:05:53.481
Can I please just come in and crash?

01:06:22.928 --> 01:06:23.970
Jeannie?

01:06:25.097 --> 01:06:25.889
What?

01:06:26.056 --> 01:06:28.474
Have you seen my portfolio?
I can't find it anywhere.

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:29.350
I don't know.

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.644
The portfolio I was putting together
for CalArts.

01:06:31.729 --> 01:06:32.937
No, I haven't seen it.

01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:37.358
- What's today?
- Um, I think the 30th.

01:06:38.319 --> 01:06:39.652
Fuck!

01:06:40.821 --> 01:06:43.281
Zachy, what are you doing?
They turned you down.

01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:46.242
Why do you wanna put yourself
through that again?

01:06:47.077 --> 01:06:48.745
I just thought I'd give it another
shot, you know?

01:06:48.913 --> 01:06:51.331
Well don't bother. That place is full
of rich kid painters

01:06:51.498 --> 01:06:53.625
and they're all gonna end up working
at art stores anyway.

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:54.667
Yeah, maybe.

01:06:55.753 --> 01:06:58.671
They're hiring at the Oceanette.
You want me to put in a good word?

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.216
It's a good job.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.343
We could use the money.

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:18.566
How come we never see Shaun anymore?

01:07:21.987 --> 01:07:24.405
Sometimes that happens, Cody.
People leave sometimes.

01:07:25.115 --> 01:07:26.950
Why did he leave?

01:07:30.412 --> 01:07:32.413
It's complicated. A grown-up thing.

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:38.127
Can we say hi to him even though
he left? He was cool.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.924
No. Sometimes people leave and never
come back.

01:07:43.842 --> 01:07:45.343
Like my daddy?

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:48.012
Yes, Cody. Like your daddy.

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:54.269
Hey.

01:07:54.436 --> 01:07:55.603
Hey, Jeannie.

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:58.398
Rick is on today. He's a nightmare.
So steer clear.

01:07:59.566 --> 01:08:00.316
Got it.

01:08:00.484 --> 01:08:01.734
Hey, Cody. Are you ready?

01:08:03.862 --> 01:08:05.613
Give me the pen.

01:08:06.991 --> 01:08:08.199

You have 1 new message.

01:10:26.505 --> 01:10:29.298
Hey, Zach.
It's Kelly Burke, from CalArts.

01:10:29.466 --> 01:10:31.175
Uh, I got your portfolio
and your application.

01:10:31.343 --> 01:10:33.219
Kinda surprised to see
that you applied again.

01:10:33.387 --> 01:10:35.346
But, really happy that you did.

01:10:35.514 --> 01:10:37.473
So I returned the portfolio to
the Ocean Beach

01:10:37.683 --> 01:10:39.642
address that you sent it from.

01:10:39.852 --> 01:10:41.769
There's a couple of things I need to
go over with you before I can

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:44.147
continue with it. So give me a call
when you get this.

01:10:44.314 --> 01:10:48.359
I'm at extension 20, and I hope to
hear from you. Alright, take care.

01:10:48.902 --> 01:10:52.613
To replay, press 4. To erase, press 7.

01:10:52.823 --> 01:10:56.784
To return this call, press 8.
To save, press 9.

01:10:56.827 --> 01:10:59.412
To hear all other options, press star.

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:20.683
Jeannie, get up!
Get up!

01:11:22.769 --> 01:11:24.145
What are you doing?

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:25.354
Sleeping.

01:11:26.231 --> 01:11:28.149
Yeah, with some help.

01:11:29.568 --> 01:11:31.861
Wait, Zach, wait.

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:35.156
Allen got that job.

01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:36.199
Yeah?

01:11:36.783 --> 01:11:40.328
In Portland and I gotta go with him.

01:11:42.539 --> 01:11:44.415
I can make good money there,
and...

01:11:46.585 --> 01:11:48.085
But they don't take kids.

01:11:50.214 --> 01:11:52.256
What do you mean they don't take kids?

01:11:52.466 --> 01:11:55.551
I don't know.
They just don't take kids.

01:11:59.973 --> 01:12:02.558
Allen's not really into it anyway.

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:10.858
Cody's gonna have to stay
here with you and Papi...

01:12:11.693 --> 01:12:13.152
At least until we get set up.

01:12:13.654 --> 01:12:15.404
With me and dad for how long?

01:12:16.281 --> 01:12:19.075
I dunno. Six months... a year maybe?

01:12:21.286 --> 01:12:23.120
You know he can't stay with dad.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.043
I know.

01:12:32.005 --> 01:12:33.589
But he can't come with me.

01:12:38.178 --> 01:12:41.889
Zach, the Oceanette is not cutting it.
I can make three times that up there.

01:12:55.153 --> 01:12:56.404
Is there any more?

01:12:58.657 --> 01:12:59.991
Well I'm full, do you want mine?

01:12:59.992 --> 01:13:01.033
Yeah.

01:13:01.868 --> 01:13:03.411
I do.

01:13:03.954 --> 01:13:04.996
You like it?

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080
Yeah.

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.418
- Mom?
- Yeah.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:12.461
Can I go to Oregon too?

01:13:16.341 --> 01:13:18.092
Cody, I told you.
You gotta stay here

01:13:18.135 --> 01:13:20.595
and keep your uncle Zach company
so he doesn't get lonely.

01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:24.974
Can you do that for mommy?

01:13:33.066 --> 01:13:34.108
Hello?

01:13:34.776 --> 01:13:36.235
No, he's not here.

01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:36.796
Hey, monkey.

01:14:37.881 --> 01:14:39.340
Hey.

01:14:43.428 --> 01:14:44.553
I got in.

01:14:44.971 --> 01:14:46.013
What?

01:14:46.431 --> 01:14:47.973
To CalArts, they took me back.

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:53.104
I don't know how I'll do it.

01:14:53.397 --> 01:14:54.855
You'll have to figure out a way.

01:14:55.065 --> 01:14:57.108
If you pass it up
You'll be stuck here.

01:14:57.984 --> 01:14:59.527
I don't feel stuck here.

01:14:59.611 --> 01:15:00.986
Yes you do.

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:05.908
Jeanne wants to go to Oregon.

01:15:06.326 --> 01:15:08.035
Maybe she'll have to stay.

01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:09.995
Cody is her responsibility.

01:15:11.832 --> 01:15:13.290
I can't leave him.

01:15:14.793 --> 01:15:16.127
Figure it out.

01:15:17.129 --> 01:15:18.337
Cheer up!

01:15:19.506 --> 01:15:21.465
Can we just celebrate?

01:15:27.264 --> 01:15:29.265
There's something I really
need to tell you.

01:15:30.809 --> 01:15:32.184
I already know.

01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:35.855
I've known for a while.

01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:42.737
You are the only reason
I wish I wasn't.

01:15:43.196 --> 01:15:46.365
None of this other shit matters.

01:15:49.327 --> 01:15:50.953
But what really sucks...

01:15:52.038 --> 01:15:55.166
Is that I've always wanted to
be everything to you.

01:15:59.212 --> 01:16:02.673
Always dreamed of providing you with
anything you ever wanted or needed.

01:16:07.387 --> 01:16:08.554
Do you love him?

01:16:08.847 --> 01:16:09.847
Oh come on...

01:16:09.973 --> 01:16:11.056
Seriously.

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:13.017
He's a good guy, Zach.

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:17.855
You don't belong to people forever.

01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:22.234
Then why bother?

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:23.986
Isn't it worth it?

01:16:27.199 --> 01:16:28.240
Yeah.

01:16:31.661 --> 01:16:33.245
- Tori.
- Yeah?

01:16:35.874 --> 01:16:37.750
Can I stay with you
just for the night?

01:16:39.336 --> 01:16:41.587
I have nowhere else to go and
I can't face Jeanne.

01:16:42.672 --> 01:16:43.714
Of course.

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:47.426
But you can't fuck me.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.762

You say something.

01:17:59.791 --> 01:18:03.127
Student was bad.
Made bad judgment call.

01:18:04.588 --> 01:18:06.046
Now see truth.

01:18:10.969 --> 01:18:12.052
Where are you?

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:15.306
Getting warmer...

01:18:16.099 --> 01:18:17.099
Colder...

01:18:20.687 --> 01:18:21.896
Turn around.

01:18:27.068 --> 01:18:28.235
I'm so sorry.

01:18:34.159 --> 01:18:35.576
You'd better be.

01:18:40.373 --> 01:18:41.916
You sent in my application?

01:18:44.169 --> 01:18:45.210
Yeah.

01:18:52.636 --> 01:18:53.886
Why are you here?

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.138
What changed?

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.100
I did.

01:19:03.355 --> 01:19:04.563
Will you help me?

01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:08.192
You serious?

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.111
Of course.
Anything.

01:19:12.322 --> 01:19:13.447
Anything?

01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:14.615
Yes.

01:19:18.495 --> 01:19:19.536
I got in.

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:22.122
- Full ride.
- Yes! I knew it!

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.041
Are you serious?

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:25.960
Yeah, I really wanna go this time.

01:19:26.044 --> 01:19:27.211
Of course.

01:19:28.046 --> 01:19:30.172
I turned down the scholarship before.

01:19:34.135 --> 01:19:37.721
My mom... Cody... everything.
I just couldn't walk out.

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.766
I never told anyone.

01:19:45.522 --> 01:19:47.022
I really wanna go this time.

01:19:47.732 --> 01:19:50.943
And you did say you lived close.

01:19:53.697 --> 01:19:55.114
Well then let's do it.

01:19:56.157 --> 01:19:58.033
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:19:59.703 --> 01:20:04.832
I'm so proud of you, man. So proud.

01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:39.199
- Shaun!
- Hey, kiddo...

01:20:39.242 --> 01:20:41.535
Allen, take Cody inside, ok?

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:46.540
Zach, what is he doing here?

01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:51.962
What? Are you bailing on me?

01:20:51.963 --> 01:20:53.088
Bailing?

01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:56.258
Jeanne, you're the one
leaving your son!

01:20:57.761 --> 01:20:59.678
If you don't like this option
then just stay.

01:20:59.846 --> 01:21:01.221
Five more minutes!

01:21:01.514 --> 01:21:03.182
Jesus, Cody. Shut the fuck up you...

01:21:03.349 --> 01:21:04.850
Don't you ever talk to him like that!

01:21:04.976 --> 01:21:06.477
- Zach!
- Allen!

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.354
- Zach!
- That fucking little shit!

01:21:09.522 --> 01:21:11.440
Take a walk baby, please?
For me. Please...

01:21:11.775 --> 01:21:13.859
Ok, ok.

01:21:15.653 --> 01:21:18.280
- Easy, easy.
- Zach, what the fuck!

01:21:22.994 --> 01:21:24.161
Jesus Christ.

01:21:27.665 --> 01:21:29.333
I'm gonna go inside and check on him.

01:21:43.723 --> 01:21:45.516
Shaun is really great, Jeanne.

01:21:46.142 --> 01:21:48.310
He really cares about Cody...
and me.

01:21:53.650 --> 01:21:56.068
If he can't be with you,
this is the next best thing.

01:21:59.405 --> 01:22:00.989
I'm gonna make it work.

01:22:08.998 --> 01:22:10.541
Jeanne, take a look around.

01:22:12.377 --> 01:22:15.379
Every kid should be so lucky.

01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:21.426
What else could you possibly
want for him?

01:22:27.934 --> 01:22:29.643
I got into CalArts.

01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:31.854
I know.

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:36.650
You know?

01:22:37.443 --> 01:22:38.902
Were you gonna tell me?

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:44.408
They told me that you
turned it down last time.

01:22:45.118 --> 01:22:47.035
I'm not going to again.

01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:50.497
No, you shouldn't.

01:22:54.043 --> 01:22:55.252
He'll be fine with us...

01:22:57.422 --> 01:22:59.506
Or stay, it's your choice.

01:23:02.468 --> 01:23:05.721
Zach, if this thing with Allen
doesn't work out...

01:23:07.223 --> 01:23:09.516
It's best that he's here with you.

01:23:12.437 --> 01:23:14.229
He's in good hands I promise.

01:23:16.983 --> 01:23:18.025
