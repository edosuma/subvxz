Clearly, Jasper
thinks you're hot

10:53.069 --> 10:55.685
but not smart enough
to be his partner.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.188
In my opinion,
he's an idiot.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.585
Well, it looks like
we're stuck together.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.284
Welcome to my world.

11:11.379 --> 11:14.121
It's quiet, but it has
its advantages.

11:14.549 --> 11:15.538

11:15.633 --> 11:17.248

No advantages.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.052
I'm Zoe.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.962
I know. I'm Lucas.

that if you're right,

to Jack today?

I couldn't avoid it.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.801
But I did get to crush
a childhood memory,
so it wasn't all bad.

12:08.895 --> 12:12.763
Did he mention
anything about Kim
or the accident?

12:14.192 --> 12:15.807
No. Why would he?

12:16.152 --> 12:20.612
I think I said something
while we were all affected
by the GABA blockage.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.855
What kind of thing?

12:24.327 --> 12:26.864
That Kim's death
wasn't an accident.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.286
Knowing Carter,
he won't leave
well enough alone.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.455
And, Henry, you said
you had proof

12:35.546 --> 12:38.458
that someone sabotaged the
experiment that killed Kim?

12:38.591 --> 12:42.129
No, I said that I'd found
something that proved
you weren't responsible.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.043
Then you need
to give it to me.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.134
No, I don't.
Henry, Carter
is on to you.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.012

to the government,

17:04.607 --> 17:06.393
You sure
you got time
to do this?

17:06.484 --> 17:08.896
Well, I've already
figured out what happened
to change these rocks.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.068
They're missing
an element called
Aluminum-26.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.025
But it will probably take me
the rest of my life to figure
out how that happened,

17:14.075 --> 17:17.192
so I might as well
support my local sheriff
in the meantime.

17:17.245 --> 17:21.579
Yay. This is Callie's
formula and a sample of
what she mixed today,

17:21.666 --> 17:24.248
and this is the
stuff that I found
in the woods.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.454
So what did you say
was missing from
the moon rocks?

17:29.549 --> 17:33.792
Aluminum-26.
A highly unstable
radioactive element.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.219
Wow. Somebody's been
stealing chemicals.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.630
What if
they stole that, too?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.049
Well, all things
being possible,

17:41.102 --> 17:43.434
these rocks are
under 24-hour surveillance
under lock and key.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.433
So once again, the
question becomes "How?"

17:46.899 --> 17:49.857
Besides, extracting Al-26
from moon rocks would require

17:49.944 --> 17:52.310
a highly sophisticated
process. You'd have
to be especially trained.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.896

Traces of radioactive

18:30.484 --> 18:31.815
It could have come
from anywhere.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.897
With Aluminum-26 isotopes?

18:34.322 --> 18:35.858
Probably happened
during transport.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.985
Well, that's what I thought
until we realized
that it's on the move.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.362
W hat?
Every time that we try
to contain

18:41.454 --> 18:45.072
the radioactivity,
it escapes, it moves,
it hides.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.959
Allison, we are sitting
on two tons of these rocks.

18:54.008 --> 18:57.000
If there's
a life form there,
we need to study it.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.630
I would rather err
on the side of caution.

I wouldn't.

19:00.431 --> 19:03.047

like this escaped
from a lab at G.D.,

19:03.142 --> 19:04.848
it ended up
in my son.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.512
So the chassis needs
to withstand at least a G
if we want to get an A.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.590
Oh, prototype.
Only one exists.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.887
Well, we have
to figure out
who did this

23:08.929 --> 23:11.466
before someone discovers
that we broke the treaty.

23:11.599 --> 23:14.181
Well, hold on.
I'm the law
in this town.

23:14.268 --> 23:15.383
How can something
beiHegal

23:15.436 --> 23:16.721
(GIGGLES)
if I don't even
know it exists?

23:16.770 --> 23:19.807
G.D. was working
on invisibility
in the late '90s

23:19.899 --> 23:22.185
At that point,
the concept was
only theoretical,

23:22.276 --> 23:25.268
but Aluminum-26 was
the key ingredient
in the formula.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.061
After 9/11,
it was shut down

23:27.114 --> 23:29.321
along with miniaturization
and teleportation.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.399
So how do you explain this?
HENRY:
Your theory was correct.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.534
Your thefts and
our thefts are related.

23:33.621 --> 23:37.955
Someone's ignoring the ban
and using Al-26 extracted
from the moon rocks.

23:38.042 --> 23:41.125
So we really are looking
for the invisible man?

23:41.211 --> 23:42.462
Or woman.

23:43.213 --> 23:46.626
In that bag that you found
was a chemical called PCE.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.248
(CLEARING THROAT)

23:48.302 --> 23:52.090
Callie Curie uses PCE
in her dry cleaning formula.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.843
All right.
Maybe it was
stolen from her.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.473
Or maybe she's been using
her business as a cover
for further experiments

23:59.563 --> 24:01.519
for the past seven years.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.644
She was part
of the original
invisibility team.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.495
Hey! Vincentjust came by.
He brought me a cappuccino.

24:18.582 --> 24:22.495
So I asked him to make us
baked Alaska tonight
in honor of the explosion.

24:22.544 --> 24:23.533
(CALLIE CHUCKLES)

24:24.338 --> 24:26.454
You don't like
baked Alaska?

24:27.591 --> 24:29.331
What have you been doing
in here, Callie?

24:29.802 --> 24:32.794
Getting out those
stubborn stains.

24:34.974 --> 24:39.343
Is there any chance that
invisibility was the key
to your success?

24:40.521 --> 24:42.386
What are you
talking about?

24:42.481 --> 24:46.520
I know that was the focus
of your research before
you started doing this.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.851
Yeah. It was.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.611
And it wasn't healthy.
It was all I had time for.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.238
That's why
I started doing this.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.567
I wanted a real life,
normal hours.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.695
Maybe a boyfriend.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.661
When the treaty
shut down your project,

25:07.548 --> 25:11.291
did you start this
business so that you could
continue your work?

25:11.385 --> 25:13.376
No. I was relieved
when they shut us down.

25:13.429 --> 25:14.714
It gave me an excuse
to get out.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.057
Look, I may have adapted
some of my research,

25:21.145 --> 25:23.932
but it's all perfectly
safe and legal.

25:24.398 --> 25:27.231
So then it was just
a coincidence that the
day your lab explodes,

25:27.317 --> 25:30.400
my daughter's car
turns invisible
right down the street?

25:30.988 --> 25:34.230
Well, okay. First of all,
are you saying that
someone's actually done this?

25:34.283 --> 25:38.401
Because without a large
amount of Aluminum-26,
that's not possible.

25:38.495 --> 25:41.737
Stolen from the unstable
compounds lab at G.D.,

25:41.832 --> 25:44.118
where you worked
for eight years.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.240
(SIGHS)

25:46.587 --> 25:48.873
I thought that you were
a betterjudge of character.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.541
Well, sometimes
I don't like myjob.

25:53.594 --> 25:56.301
My G.D. clearance
was revoked when
the treaty was signed,

25:56.388 --> 25:58.219
and I haven't set foot
in that building since.

25:58.265 --> 26:01.723
You don't believe me,
check the security records.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.807
I'm going to need the names
of everybody you worked with
on that team.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.980
I've got
to check them out.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.186
Fine.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.934
Sometimes I don't
like yourjob either.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.366
ALLISON: We have
trace readings of
radiation everywhere.

26:19.453 --> 26:22.411
Eighteen locations,
no discernable pattern.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.367
Looks like they're using
the air ducts to travel.

26:24.458 --> 26:25.618
Oh, great.
Just what we need.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.665
Airborne intelligent
radioactive life.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.118
From space.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.290
Can we put a bell
on him or something?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.126
Every time we have
a part of it cornered,

26:33.175 --> 26:35.791
it moves like
it knows that
we're chasing it.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.256
Right now the levels
aren't harmful, but
if they get any higher,

26:38.305 --> 26:41.968
I'm going to have
to evacuate the building.
Maybe even the town.

26:42.059 --> 26:45.893
Carter, please tell me
that you have figured out
this invisibility problem.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.970
Tell me about
Frank Phillips.

26:48.065 --> 26:51.603
He's a surveillance
specialist. Why do you
need to know?

26:51.652 --> 26:53.188
I'm confirming
Callie's list.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.814
What was he before?

26:54.863 --> 26:58.822
D.O.D. had me put him
on the invisibility team
for a short while.

26:59.993 --> 27:00.982
Where is he?

27:03.705 --> 27:05.741
He's a CIA
surveillance
specialist.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.619
A spook's spook.
An enigma.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.408
He's so private,
he won't even look
in a mirror.

27:09.503 --> 27:10.538
You can't tell him
I let you in.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.745
Fargo, it's
an official
investigation.

27:12.840 --> 27:13.875
Yeah, but
if he finds out...

27:13.966 --> 27:14.955
Frank Phillips is
the only member

27:15.008 --> 27:16.509
of the original
invisibility team
who still works here.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.464
And the person who
stole Aluminum-26 had
to have G.D. access.

27:19.513 --> 27:23.097
They say he killed
a man in Borneo just
to watch him die.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.845
I think you've seen
too many spy movies.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.139
Just unlock the door.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.893
What if he's
in there?

27:31.984 --> 27:33.975
No one's seen him
in two weeks.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.016
Exactly.

27:35.112 --> 27:39.651
What if he's in there
invisible with a poison
blowgun from Borneo, waiting?

27:40.367 --> 27:41.573
Just...

27:42.870 --> 27:44.906
Then he'll
get you first.

27:51.044 --> 27:55.378
Whoa. The guy's been here
for 15 years. You'd think
he'd put a picture up.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.335
He might still be here.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.005
You start
with his computer.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.464
What? Me?

28:02.556 --> 28:04.467
Well, he's already
gonna kill you
for opening the door.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.173
Why risk anyone else?

28:13.901 --> 28:15.892
What's supposed
to be in here?

28:15.944 --> 28:17.559
Lincoln would know.

28:17.613 --> 28:18.602
Lincoln...

28:18.697 --> 28:20.562
Lincoln,
the poop guy.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.741
(EXCLAIMS) Lincoln,
the poop guy.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.951
Some offices have
a plant guy.
I'm the poop guy.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.907
Not glamorous,
but it's work.

28:32.002 --> 28:34.334
I found an empty cage
in Frank Phillips' office.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.412
My favorite kind.
Yeah?

28:36.506 --> 28:37.882
You have any idea
what was in there?

28:37.925 --> 28:41.088
Mice. Eighteen of them.
Cute white ones.

28:41.178 --> 28:43.294
Not like those rats
they feed all that
artificial sweetener to

28:43.388 --> 28:46.004
to see how long
it would take them
to explode.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.761
Did you say 18?

28:51.104 --> 28:53.846
(MICE SQUEAKING)

28:53.941 --> 28:55.647
That's all of them.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.269
Now I never would
have spotted them
without this headgear.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.229
Mind ifI keep it?
Yes.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.984
You're welcome.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.494
Well, little white mice,
not little green men.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.197
Alien problem solved,
no extra charge.

29:12.584 --> 29:16.122
NATHAN: These little guys
were the 18 hotspots running
around the building.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.955
Radiation poisoning
will kill them
within 24 hours.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.506
How did they
get exposed
to radiation?

29:21.593 --> 29:24.881
I don't know. Al-26 works
as a viral pathogen,

29:24.972 --> 29:27.304
but only subcutaneous
exposure is dangerous.

29:27.391 --> 29:30.428
Frank Phillips must
have used the mice
as test subjects.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.264
But why would he have made
them invisible if he knew
it was going to kill them?

29:33.313 --> 29:35.554
Maybe you don't
use Al-26 to make
something invisible.

29:35.649 --> 29:38.106
You use it to make
something come back.

29:38.151 --> 29:41.769
He figured out the
formula for invisibility
but not the reversal.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.067
Well, he must
be desperate
to use Al-26.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.659
He's got
enough experience
to extract it,

29:46.743 --> 29:49.155
but there's no way
he'll find an answer
out there alone.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.160
What's the effect
on humans?

29:51.206 --> 29:55.575
Only subjects with direct
exposure, say, through
an injection, are at risk.

29:58.255 --> 29:59.961
Or a cut on a hand.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.094
So what can we do?

30:16.189 --> 30:18.805
The invisibility formula
attacks organic cells.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.316
Mice, Carter,
Carter's clothes.

30:21.361 --> 30:23.852
Callie's dry cleaning formula
contains tiny microbes

30:23.947 --> 30:26.063
that continue washing
in between cleanings.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.274
Leave it to Eureka.
And what about the car?

30:28.368 --> 30:30.074
Encased in an organic
polymer wrap,

30:30.162 --> 30:33.074
a kind of super skin
developed in the genetics lab
to help burn victims.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.326
And, apparently,
it's really good
on minor dents and dings.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.208
Henry thinks Carter
got exposed when he cut
his hand on the windshield,

30:38.253 --> 30:40.209
and now it's spreading
through his entire body.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.870
(SIGHS)
Radioactive
viral pathogen.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.000
From hell.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.338
Did you check on Zoe?

30:47.387 --> 30:49.844
She's fine.
Jo's with her
while you're here.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.005
Okay.

30:52.559 --> 30:55.266
I don't want her
to know, okay?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.220
Not until we fix this.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.396
Jack...

31:05.113 --> 31:08.571
Al-26 radiation,
it's highly toxic
to your system,

31:08.617 --> 31:11.575
and if we can't reverse
the process in 24 hours,

31:11.620 --> 31:14.327
we won't be able
to reverse this at all.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.323
So I'll be invisible forever?

31:23.090 --> 31:26.799
Oh, I'll be dead
and invisible forever.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.015
We'll never make it.
We have 15 hours left.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.387
That's the point.

31:36.436 --> 31:39.394
Anyone could figure this out
if they had all the time
in the world.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.930
How can you be
so cool about this?

31:41.983 --> 31:45.146
I'm not cool, as you've
repeatedly pointed out.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.815
Ijust know who I am
and what I'm capable of.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.771
Yeah, well, I know
I'll be a lot happier
when Jo gets back

31:49.866 --> 31:52.278
from the hardware store
with those cooling rods.

31:52.369 --> 31:53.950
I think you're
missing the point.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.117
The point?

31:55.205 --> 31:58.447
(SCOFFS) The point is,
if I don't get straight A's,
I don't get to drive.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.991
I'm talking about
the big picture.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.498
You get distracted
by all the crap.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.917
You can't see what's
right in front of you.

32:05.966 --> 32:07.297
Like what?

32:07.634 --> 32:08.840
Like me.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.336
Think of everything
you've missed because
you made a snap judgment

32:12.431 --> 32:16.015
and decided that
I wasn't your type.

32:16.101 --> 32:20.060
Oh, please. All I've missed
is you telling me
how shallow I am.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.387
And this.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.476
You're not shallow.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.230
You just haven't
explored your depth.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.406
JO: Whoa, no, no, no.

32:35.328 --> 32:38.286
No exploring
on my watch.
We clear?

32:39.833 --> 32:41.198
CALLIE: So how long
has this been going on?

32:41.293 --> 32:42.373
It started
a few hours ago.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.496
We thought maybe
you could help.

32:43.545 --> 32:44.660
What's the rate
of progression?

32:44.713 --> 32:46.704
Faster than
we would like.

32:46.798 --> 32:47.913
Jack?

32:48.008 --> 32:50.169
ALLISON: He'll be
completely invisible
within an hour.

32:50.260 --> 32:51.716
Hi, Callie.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.429
Oh, my God.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.429
If you didn't want
to go out to dinner,
you could have just said so.

32:56.516 --> 32:57.505
(LAUGHS)

32:57.601 --> 33:00.013
If you could work
with Nathan Stark
and Henry Deacon

33:00.103 --> 33:02.594
and help them
figure out how
to reverse it.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.350
And if you could
tell us everything
you know

33:04.399 --> 33:06.856
about a guy named
Frank Phillips.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.808
We called him
Frank the spook.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.319
Very intense.
Not the warm, fuzzy type.

33:11.364 --> 33:12.695
We know that he was CIA,

33:12.741 --> 33:15.483
but what did he have
to do with the original
invisibility team?

33:15.535 --> 33:17.366
The D.O.D. had us
working with the CIA

33:17.412 --> 33:19.778
on finding a way
to make their operatives
truly stealth.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.158
Invisible spies?

33:21.208 --> 33:24.575
We were years away
from human testing, but,
yeah, that was the goal.

33:24.669 --> 33:28.332
I think Frank the spook may
have carried the ball over
the goal line all by himself.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.246
He had the rudimentary
scientific background,

33:30.342 --> 33:32.549
but it's highly unlikely
he could have succeeded
on his own.

33:32.594 --> 33:35.176
We need to find him
and find out what he did,
or else Carter...

33:35.222 --> 33:39.716
Callie, is there anywhere
he used to talk about?

33:39.768 --> 33:41.304
Some place he used to go?

33:42.229 --> 33:45.562
You know, I ran
into him once near
Strawberry Knoll.

33:45.649 --> 33:49.062
And I remember that he had
lots of supplies with him
but no camping gear.

33:49.152 --> 33:53.111
The dog that was barking
at nothing was over
by Strawberry Knoll.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.449
He's going to kill me.
I'm going to die.

34:00.121 --> 34:02.658
CARTER: Wrong direction.
Stop sneaking up
on me like that!

34:02.749 --> 34:04.489
I'm invisible, Fargo.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.085
FARGO:
I thought you were Frank.

34:06.169 --> 34:09.206
Come on. The dog was
barking where we found
the stolen chemicals.

34:09.256 --> 34:11.167
I'm thinking
Frank's hideout has
to be somewhere...

34:11.258 --> 34:14.421
FARGO: Jack, look out
for the invisible shed.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.877
CARTER: Give me those.
(SIGHS) Okay.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.219
CARTER: That shed's
made out of metal.

34:22.269 --> 34:25.602
FARGO: Maybe it's covered
in the same stuff that
was on Zoe's car.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.103
Is that
even possible?

34:27.190 --> 34:29.306
Asks the invisible sheriff.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.064
FARGO:
What if he's in there?

34:35.115 --> 34:36.821
CARTER:
There's no one here.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.285
Good. Let's go.
This place is creepy.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.487
CARTER:
You can see all this?

34:40.579 --> 34:43.616
FARGO: Of course.
Remember, the skin makes the
outside of the shed invisible,

34:43.665 --> 34:44.700
not the inside.

34:44.791 --> 34:48.454
At least we have
all of his research.
Here. Put these on.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.084
Let's go.
Where?

34:50.130 --> 34:51.791
(DOG BARKING)

34:51.840 --> 34:53.751
Dogs don't bark
at nothing.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.597
CARTER: This is where
Zoe had her accident.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.304
Wait, wait, wait.
There's something
right there.

35:06.396 --> 35:07.636
What is it?

35:09.149 --> 35:10.764
CARTER:
It's Frank, isn't it?

35:10.817 --> 35:12.318
Unfortunately.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.521
He's dead?

35:14.613 --> 35:15.978
Pretty much.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.318
Zoe hit him.

35:22.996 --> 35:26.238
Somehow, I don't think
it was a car that killed him.

35:36.718 --> 35:38.128
ALLISON:
This is really bad.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.669
Carter's completely gone.
We have to help him.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.756
NATHAN: Henry's
finishing the autopsy
on Frank Phillips.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.136
His radiation level
was beyond lethal.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.643
He was definitely
a corpse before
Zoe hit him.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.804
He must have
just dropped dead
at the side of the road.

35:50.857 --> 35:53.644
And what about the formula
that Carter found in the shed?
Can we reverse it?

35:53.693 --> 35:56.480
Callie's working on it.
But unless we find something
in the next few hours...

35:56.529 --> 35:59.191
The radiation exposure
will bejust as lethal
as Frank's.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.071
Yeah.
I hate this.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.697
All this technology,
and we can't heal
what really matters.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.075
You know what?
Let's find Fargo.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.537
Let's get the specs
on Zoe's Smart Car.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.833
And tell him we need
14 square feet of his skin.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.257
Okay.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.211
Beginning incision.

36:34.109 --> 36:36.100
This is what's invisible.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.727
It's the car's
organic wrap.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.442
It's a human skin base,
but it absorbs damage

36:41.533 --> 36:43.524
and it heals much faster
than the human body.

36:43.576 --> 36:46.192
A rather brilliant
innovation ifI may
say so myself.

36:46.246 --> 36:50.580
NATHAN: Well, let's just hope
it heals fast enough to shed
the radioactive byproducts

36:50.667 --> 36:52.578
once we reverse the
invisibility formula.

36:52.669 --> 36:55.957
Do you think the
data that Carter found
in the shed is accurate?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.503
You know I was there,
too, right?

36:57.590 --> 36:59.205
CALLIE: Frank was close
to figuring it out.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.749
He just had
the ratios wrong.

37:00.844 --> 37:03.551
If he'd just told someone
about this, he might have
made it through.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.097
Well, people get used
to working alone.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.637
It makes it hard
to trust.

37:08.309 --> 37:11.221
So if we're right,
his skin should absorb
the reversal formula.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.762
And with any luck,
the radioactivity of Al-26.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.271
Let's do this.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.822
And now you see it.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.783
FARGO: Zoe's car's back,
completely normal

37:27.871 --> 37:31.329
after we applied the
invisibility reversal formula
to its organic skin.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.156
CARTER: Yeah.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.789
Guys, that's just
great, but help me.

37:36.838 --> 37:38.703
God, my hands
are shaking.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.538
Dr. Stark can do it
if you'd like.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.841
No, thank you.
I'm the one who started
working on invisibility.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.260
I should be the one
to finish it.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.360
CARTER: Guys?

38:05.325 --> 38:06.565
It's not working.

38:06.659 --> 38:09.366
We could try
another piece.
NATHAN: Wait.

38:10.038 --> 38:11.994
Radiation level's
dropping.

38:12.499 --> 38:13.488
Three percent.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.407
Five percent.

38:15.502 --> 38:19.165
CARTER:
Watch. I'll be alive,
but I'll still be invisible.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.459
Twenty percent.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.748
NATHAN:
You're going to be fine.

38:26.513 --> 38:27.878
(SIGHS)
You did it.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.675
We all did it.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.143
Could someone just
finish doing it?

38:54.833 --> 38:56.039
(CARTER CLEARS THROAT)

38:56.125 --> 38:57.911
Long night
for everyone, I see.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.539
Hey, Dad.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.588
Did you hear anything
about my car?

39:05.260 --> 39:07.125
Well, we can
see it again.
Mmm.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.844
I was afraid
it was gone for good.

39:10.223 --> 39:11.713
You don't know
the half of it.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.852
Do I even want
to know why
he's in there?

39:14.894 --> 39:19.604
No. Not if you want
a good night's sleep
between now and her wedding.

to Casper?

Rise and shine,
lover boy.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.403
I don't know.
I guess I just saw
right through him.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.197
The Ro-Boxcar
looks great.

39:37.625 --> 39:42.039
I'm guessing it's going
to be the only thing
I'm driving for a while, huh?

39:42.422 --> 39:46.461
Well, you did
break the rules.

39:46.968 --> 39:50.677
But I should have believed
you that the accident
wasn't your fault.

39:50.763 --> 39:51.752
So...

39:51.848 --> 39:54.089
So I can take
my car out again?

39:54.142 --> 39:57.475
Oh, no, no.
But you can still
be my chauffeur.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.226
Mmm.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.933
I suppose we
have to get this
to school, huh?

40:01.983 --> 40:04.690
No, there's no hurry.
We finished early.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.155

NATHAN: Beverly,
Beverly, Beverly.

40:23.463 --> 40:26.296
She planted this
near Kim's computer
the day of the accident.

40:26.382 --> 40:27.792
It's a re-calibration
device.

40:27.884 --> 40:31.593
It created false readouts
as Kim began the extraction
from the artifact.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.503
Which means someone was
willing to kill

40:34.349 --> 40:36.260
to keep us away
from the artifact.

40:37.644 --> 40:41.978
Nathan, I'm gonna
trust you with this.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.501
Check.

41:02.585 --> 41:03.825
Told you you'd be
good at this.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.665

the floor with you.

His one-year anniversary
in Eureka.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.861
He has a thing
for shrimp.

41:32.949 --> 41:35.691
How appropriate.
I can't believe
it's been a year.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.529
Yeah. Seems like 11.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.449
I didn't even remember.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.073
Well, maybe you've been
thinking about something else.

Or maybe I was thinking
about someone else.
