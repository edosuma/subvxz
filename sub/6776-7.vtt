02:38.660 --> 02:40.252
Hey.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.397
Hi.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.890
Me and my buddy,
we just moved in next door.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.891
We were wondering
who lives here.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.925
Nice to meet you.

02:46.930 --> 02:49.125
I was just about
to get in the shower.

02:49.130 --> 02:52.588
C'mon in,
I'll be out in a moment.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.397
( male #1 )
Nice.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.890
( male #2 )
She's hot.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.255
( male #1 )
Hey, you're telling me.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.251
Hey, I thought I told you guys
to wait in the other room.

03:02.260 --> 03:04.399
Well, we thought
you might need some help...

03:04.400 --> 03:06.049
getting clean.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.496
( music playing )

03:14.400 --> 03:17.096
This is so cool.

03:19.260 --> 03:21.899
You like this,
don't you ?

03:21.900 --> 03:23.595
( female )
Oh, Yeah.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.160
Why don't we move
over here ?

03:28.600 --> 03:30.227
( laughing )

03:30.230 --> 03:33.324
( moaning )

03:36.760 --> 03:39.649
Oh, you're a nasty girl,
aren't you ?

03:39.660 --> 03:43.198
( moaning )

03:44.200 --> 03:47.920
Oh, you guys are
the best neighbors I ever had.

03:47.930 --> 03:51.058
( moaning )

03:56.060 --> 03:58.893
Oh, yeah,
C'mon, c'mon !

03:58.900 --> 04:00.322
Baby, c'mon !

04:00.330 --> 04:03.720
(tv playing louder)

04:19.100 --> 04:20.897
( doorbell )

04:29.830 --> 04:31.752
DAVID ?

04:35.630 --> 04:37.598
YOU'RE ALL WET.

04:38.260 --> 04:40.296
WERE YOU CRYING ?

04:40.300 --> 04:42.860
NO, IT WAS RAINING.

04:42.860 --> 04:45.624
AND YES,
I WAS CRYING.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.893
I LOVE YOU.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.789
I LOVE YOU.

04:53.860 --> 04:57.250
I DON'T THINK SO
ANYMORE

04:57.260 --> 05:00.991
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR THE ENDING MY STORY LACKS

05:01.000 --> 05:04.629
A STRONG ENOUGH MAGNET
TO PULL ME BACK

05:04.630 --> 05:09.920
OOH, YOU ARE THAT...

05:19.560 --> 05:21.824
(turning radio off)

05:32.000 --> 05:36.221
Well, we get just about
all the minerals and vitamins

05:36.230 --> 05:38.721
that bones need
from things like sunshine.

05:38.730 --> 05:42.154
DIDN'T I ASK YOU
TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF ?

05:43.130 --> 05:46.258
WHY DID YOU ASK FOR AN OMELET
IF YOU WEREN'T HUNGRY ?

05:46.260 --> 05:48.296
I WAS, BUT...

05:48.300 --> 05:50.222
NOW MY TUMMY HURTS.

05:50.230 --> 05:51.458
AGAIN ?

05:51.460 --> 05:53.348
GIRL, YOU BETTER
EAT SOME BREAKFAST.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.328
MAYBE I'M FULL.

05:55.330 --> 05:58.754
EAT HALF OF IT AND
YOU CAN WATCH A LITTLE MTV.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.797
OR EAT NONE OF IT
AND GO TO SCHOOL HUNGRY,
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.688
OH, THAT'S GOOD,
BRIBE HER.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.793
DID I ASK
FOR YOUR INPUT ?

06:05.800 --> 06:07.756
I GOTTA GO.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.954
GO.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.225
YOUR CAR IS
BLOCKING ME IN.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.699
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU ?

06:24.200 --> 06:26.054
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH ME ?

06:26.060 --> 06:26.924
YEAH !

06:26.930 --> 06:27.851
I'M TAKING CARE
OF TAYLOR.

06:27.860 --> 06:28.997
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE HER MOTHER IS.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.854
I HAVEN'T HAD A FULL
NIGHT'S SLEEP IN TWO MONTHS,

06:30.860 --> 06:32.350
SINCE I SHOT
AND KILLED THAT MAN,

06:32.360 --> 06:33.725
AND I'M SICK OF YOU
GIVING ME SHIT !

06:33.730 --> 06:35.129
OH YEAH, AND I'M SICK
AND TIRED OF YOU

06:35.130 --> 06:36.324
TAKING IT ALL
OUT ON ME.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.651
THIS IS WAY MORE
THAN I SIGNED ON FOR.

06:38.660 --> 06:39.991
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'VE GOT AN IDEA,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.399
WHY DON'T YOU
FIND WHAT'S YOURS,

06:41.400 --> 06:42.697
AND TAKE IT WITH YOU
WHEN YOU LEAVE,

06:42.700 --> 06:45.260
THAT WAY I'LL NEVER HAVE
TO LOOK AT YOUR SORRY ASS AGAIN.

06:45.260 --> 06:46.659
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

06:46.660 --> 06:47.524
I'LL GO RIGHT NOW,

06:47.530 --> 06:48.724
AND IF YOU FIND
ANY OF MY STUFF,

06:48.730 --> 06:50.618
YOU CAN SHOVE IT UP
YOUR TIGHT, WHITE ASS.

06:50.630 --> 06:52.825
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO ?

06:52.830 --> 06:56.698
I KNOW YOU JUST DIDN'T
CALL MY ASS WHITE !

07:03.030 --> 07:05.954
MY TUMMY HURTS.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.198
THE ANSWER IS NO,
I'M SORRY.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.328
MOM, IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S SOME STRANGER,

07:16.330 --> 07:17.490
IT'S YOUR SISTER.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.752
AND IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S KABUL,
IT'S TOPANGA.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.193
IT'S NOT EVEN
AN HOUR FROM HERE.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.997
YOU HEARD WHAT
WAS DONE TO NATE.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.027
MOM, I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING WAS DONE TO HIM.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.897
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T
HUNG OUT WITH ANY
15-YEAR-OLD GUYS LATELY,

07:29.900 --> 07:31.993
THEY'RE LIKE
TOTAL HORNSWAGGLERS.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.854
IT WAS A MUCH MORE
INNOCENT TIME.

07:33.860 --> 07:35.851
WHAT, THE 805 ?

07:35.860 --> 07:38.124
AND YOUR BROTHER WAS
A MUCH MORE INNOCENT BOY,

07:38.130 --> 07:39.688
TO SAY NOTHING OF
WHAT HAPPENED TO DAVID.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.123
HE HIKED THREE MILES
DOWN THE CANYON IN PITCH DARK,

07:42.130 --> 07:43.927
JUST TO GET AWAY
FROM THOSE PEOPLE.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.852
HE CUT HIS EAR
ON A BRAMBLE !

07:45.860 --> 07:47.919
THE ANSWER IS NO !

07:48.930 --> 07:51.353
MOM, HAVE YOU THOUGHT AT ALL
ABOUT SCAFFOLDING ?

07:51.360 --> 07:55.091
WHEN YOUR HOUSE
IS FALLING APART,

07:55.100 --> 07:58.126
YOU BUILD SCAFFOLDING,
TO LIKE, SUPPORT YOU

07:58.130 --> 07:59.859
WHILE YOU'RE
DOING THE WORK.

07:59.860 --> 08:01.896
AND I THINK A GREAT WAY
TO BUILD SCAFFOLDING

08:01.900 --> 08:05.996
IS TO REVISIT OLD EXPERIENCES,
BUT TRY THEM A NEW WAY.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.458
SO, I'M GOING OUT THERE
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY.

08:09.460 --> 08:12.293
AND SPEND THE WEEKEND,

08:12.300 --> 08:14.757
AND BE BACK
ON SUNDAY.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.228
( door closing )

08:18.230 --> 08:19.857
I HAVEN'T EVEN
TOLD JUSTIN YET.

08:19.860 --> 08:23.899
HE DOESN'T KNOW
HIS FATHER'S DEAD.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.197
JEWISH TRADITION SAYS
WE HAVE TO BURY HIM TOMORROW.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.751
YOU HAVE HAD JEWISH FUNERALS
HERE BEFORE, RIGHT ?

08:32.760 --> 08:34.796
OF COURSE.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.520
WE DECIDED NOT TO
DO THIS IN OUR TEMPLE,

08:38.530 --> 08:41.658
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
JEFFREY DIED.

08:43.700 --> 08:46.089
JESS, IF YOU WANT,

08:46.100 --> 08:47.954
I CAN DO THIS
WITH JEFFREY'S MOTHER.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.019
FUCK IT,
I CAN DO IT.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.249
WHAT DO YOU
NEED TO KNOW ?

08:53.260 --> 08:56.149
HE KILLED HIMSELF,

08:56.160 --> 08:58.219
FOR NO REASON,

08:58.230 --> 09:01.119
WHILE I WAS AT
GODDAMN GYMBOREE WITH TESS.

09:01.130 --> 09:03.325
TESS IS FOUR.

09:03.330 --> 09:06.822
AND WHILE I WAS WITH HER,
MY HUSBAND, JEFFREY SHAPIRO,

09:06.830 --> 09:10.493
WHO WORKED FOR THE THIRD BEST
LAW FIRM IN L.A.,

09:10.500 --> 09:13.253
AND WAS THREE MONTHS
AWAY FROM MAKING PARTNER...

09:13.260 --> 09:18.459
HE CAME HOME
ON HIS LUNCH BREAK

09:18.460 --> 09:22.499
AND HE HUNG HIMSELF WITH
HIS PANTS AROUND HIS ANKLES

09:22.500 --> 09:24.889
IN OUR GODDAMN SUNROOM.

09:28.730 --> 09:31.619
CAN YOU SAY THAT
IN HEBREW ?

09:33.760 --> 09:37.457
SO, YOU'LL BE
CONDUCTING THE SERVICE, RABBI ?

09:37.460 --> 09:39.553
MM-HMM.

09:41.830 --> 09:45.220
I LOVE MY NEW PLACE,
YOU HAVE TO COME SEE IT.

09:45.230 --> 09:48.529
IT'S A CONDO,
BUT IT'S LIKE A HOTEL TOO.

09:48.530 --> 09:50.225
IT'S GOT A CONCIERGE.

09:50.230 --> 09:51.697
AND A BIDET !

09:51.700 --> 09:52.792
THANK YOU.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.358
OH MISS, GET ME ONE
OF THOSE JUMBO BEERS

09:54.360 --> 09:55.793
ON THE SIDE, AS WELL.

09:55.800 --> 09:56.949
I'LL SHARE IT
WITH YOU.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.052
GET YOUR OWN.

09:58.060 --> 09:59.322
MAKE IT TWO, THANKS.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.321
TO LIVING ALONE,
FINALLY.

10:01.330 --> 10:04.356
TO BIDETS.

10:09.930 --> 10:11.898
AND TO STARTING OVER...

10:11.900 --> 10:13.197
WITH US, SWEETH EART.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.794
I THINK I WAS UNDER MUCH
MUCH MORE EMOTIONAL PRESSURE,

10:15.800 --> 10:17.199
THAN I EVER REALIZED.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.225
AND I'M ACTUALLY
SO SORRY,

10:19.230 --> 10:21.198
FOR THOSE AWFUL THINGS
I SAID TO YOU.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.428
WELL, THANK YOU.

10:22.430 --> 10:26.423
AREN'T YOU GONNA SAY
YOU'RE SORRY FOR HITTING ME ?

10:26.430 --> 10:28.853
YES, THAT WAS
INSANE OF ME, BUT--

10:28.860 --> 10:31.693
NO "BUTS" BRENDA,
I MEAN, JUST BE SORRY.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.349
I KNOW IT WAS
PROBABLY MY FAULT,

10:33.360 --> 10:36.750
BUT I DON'T
WANT TO KNOW WHY.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.296
OKAY.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.791
ALRIGHT, SO...

10:40.800 --> 10:42.119
NOW THE HEADLINE,

10:42.130 --> 10:44.621
THAT WHORE HAS MOVED INTO
THE HOUSE WITH YOUR FATHER.

10:44.630 --> 10:45.995
DAD'S SEEING
A WHORE ?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.797
THE WHORE OF
TRANQUILITY SPA, BRENDA.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.496
HAS YOUR FATHER SAID
ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT HER ?

10:50.500 --> 10:53.219
I MEAN, WHAT'S IN IT
FOR HER, MONEY ?

10:53.230 --> 10:55.221
I KNOW SHE'S NOT
IN IT FOR SEX.

10:55.230 --> 10:57.790
GOD KNOWS YOUR FATHER'S
NOT WHAT HE USED TO BE,

10:57.800 --> 10:59.654
NOT AFTER THREE YEARS
OF PAXIL.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.651
OKAY, THAT'LL BE FINE, MOM.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.796
ALRIGHTY THEN,
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.098
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO LOSE THE FOCUS JUST YET ?

11:08.100 --> 11:12.059
C'MON NOW,
WHAT'S UP IN YOUR WORLD ?

11:13.200 --> 11:16.795
NATE AND I
ARE GETTING MARRIED.

11:20.260 --> 11:21.750
OH, BRENDA.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.251
OH, HONEY,
IS HE SMART ENOUGH FOR YOU ?

11:24.260 --> 11:26.899
DOES HE HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES,

11:26.900 --> 11:28.299
UP HERE ?

11:28.300 --> 11:29.790
LIKE YOU ?

11:29.800 --> 11:31.654
LIKE ME ?

11:31.660 --> 11:33.821
NO, MOM,
HE'S NOT LIKE US.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.297
HE DOESN'T
THINK SO HARD,

11:35.300 --> 11:37.552
HE WANTS TO PUT A STAPLE GUN
TO HIS FOREHEAD.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.028
OH, I GET IT,
HE'S UNCOMPLICATED.

11:40.030 --> 11:43.056
WELL, I'VE BEEN WITH A MAN
OR THREE LIKE THAT.

11:43.060 --> 11:45.995
BUT BERN,
BERN ALWAYS HAD ME,

11:46.000 --> 11:49.492
BECAUSE I KNEW HE WAS
MUCH SMARTER THAN I AM.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.718
THAT'S WHY IT'S STILL
SO HOT WITH US,

11:51.730 --> 11:53.391
ALL THESE YEARS LATER.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.992
AND WE'RE BACK.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.992
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.958
SO, HOW DID HE PROPOSE ?

12:00.960 --> 12:03.758
OH, I ASKED HIM.

12:04.930 --> 12:07.922
YOU DIDN'T.

12:07.930 --> 12:11.195
YEAH, I KNOW
IT'S REALLY FUNNY,

12:11.200 --> 12:13.760
IT'S ALMOST AS FUNNY
AS THE NOTION OF YOU

12:13.760 --> 12:15.853
TRYING TO BUILD
A LIFE ON YOUR OWN.

12:15.860 --> 12:19.296
( hysterical laughing )

12:21.860 --> 12:23.725
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW
HE COULD KILL HIMSELF

12:23.730 --> 12:24.924
WHEN HE'S GOT THREE KIDS.

12:24.930 --> 12:26.522
I DON'T THINK
HE MEANT TO.

12:26.530 --> 12:27.758
HE HUNG HIMSELF.

12:27.760 --> 12:31.594
YEAH, BUT I TALKED TO
THE QUINCY DOWN AT THE MORGUE.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.091
AND HE SAYS THAT
THE COPS SAID,

12:34.100 --> 12:36.091
THERE WAS A PORNO
PLAYING IN THE VCR,

12:36.100 --> 12:38.318
AND THEY FOUND
A BOTTLE OF ASTROGLIDE.

12:38.330 --> 12:40.195
WHAT'S ASTROGLIDE ?

12:40.200 --> 12:41.326
IT'S LUBE.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.150
LU BRICATION FOR SEX.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.752
THANK YOU, DAVID.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.795
NO PROBLEMO.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.449
WAIT A MINUTE,
I KNOW ABOUT THIS.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.394
HE WAS DOING
AUTO-EROTIC ASPHYXIATION, RIGHT,

12:49.400 --> 12:50.822
LIKE THE GUY
IN THAT BAND ?

12:50.830 --> 12:51.797
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.654
SEE, YOU CUT OFF
THE AIR SUPPLY,

12:53.660 --> 12:56.322
AND THAT HEIGHTENS
THE STIMULATION
AND THE ENSUING ORGASM,

12:56.330 --> 12:58.025
AND HERE WAS
THE GIVEAWAY,

12:58.030 --> 13:00.351
THEY FOUND A LEMON WEDGE
ON THE FLOOR.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.622
A LEMON WEDGE ?

13:01.630 --> 13:03.598
YOU KEEP THE LEMON
IN YOUR MOUTH,

13:03.600 --> 13:07.297
AND AT THE MOMENT
OF CLIMAX, YOU...

13:07.300 --> 13:11.498
BITE DOWN ON IT
TO WAKE YOU UP,

13:11.500 --> 13:12.990
SO YOU DON'T DIE.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.549
SEE, THE LEMON
WAS LAYING ON THE FLOOR,

13:16.560 --> 13:18.949
UNTOUCHED.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.724
( phone ringing )

13:21.730 --> 13:24.096
DAVID FISHER.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.727
Hey, David.

13:25.730 --> 13:27.789
I'M CALLING TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT EDDIE AND I BROKE UP.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.894
KEITH, I'M SO SORRY,
ARE YOU OKAY ?

13:30.900 --> 13:33.824
YEAH, I BROKE IT OFF
WITH HIM.

13:33.830 --> 13:36.128
OH, WOW.

13:36.130 --> 13:38.849
Yeah.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.049
ALRIGHT, THEN.

13:43.060 --> 13:44.823
OKAY.

13:44.830 --> 13:47.355
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR TELLING ME,

13:47.360 --> 13:49.157
I'M GOING TO GO NOW.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.499
SO, THERE'S THIS
PART IN MY BOOK,

13:54.500 --> 13:57.924
WHERE THE MAIN CHARACTER
MEETS A HIGH-CLASS HOOKER.

13:57.930 --> 13:59.625
WAIT,

13:59.630 --> 14:02.758
WAIT, IS THIS FICTION
OR NON-FICTION ?

14:02.760 --> 14:04.557
IT'S STILL KIND OF
WORKING ITSELF OUT,

14:04.560 --> 14:07.051
BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY
SOMEONE BASED ON YOU.

14:07.060 --> 14:09.426
WELL, PART OF HER
IS YOU.

14:09.430 --> 14:10.556
EXCELLENT.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.427
AS LONG AS SHE DOESN'T
GET RAPED AND MURDERED

14:13.430 --> 14:14.829
TO PAY FOR HER SINS.

14:14.830 --> 14:16.923
I AM SO SICK OF THAT
TIRED OLD STORY.

14:16.930 --> 14:19.148
NO, SHE'S WAY BEYOND
CONVENTIONAL MORALITY.

14:19.160 --> 14:22.948
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO READ IT.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.823
I JERKED OFF A CLIENT
THE OTHER DAY.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.855
OH!

14:28.860 --> 14:32.398
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU DID RELEASE.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.049
NO, NO, I DON'T.

14:34.060 --> 14:39.225
I MEAN,
HE DIDN'T ASK ME TO.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.758
WELL, OKAY, SO, I'M SURE
YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMETIMES

14:43.760 --> 14:45.296
A GUY GETS A HARD-ON.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.393
NORMALLY
I JUST IGNORE IT.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.721
SO, WHAT, IS THIS GUY
JUST EXCEPTIONALLY HOT ?

14:49.730 --> 14:51.152
NO, NOT EVEN.

14:51.160 --> 14:54.049
OKAY, SO, I'M GIVING
THE GUY A MASSAGE,

14:54.060 --> 14:56.654
HE FLIPS OVER,
THERE'S THIS HARD-ON.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.628
IT WAS KIND OF HUGE,

14:58.630 --> 15:00.996
LIKE YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS
BY LOOKING AT THE GUY.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.256
AND I COULD TELL THAT
HE WANTED ME TO TOUCH IT.

15:06.260 --> 15:09.525
AND I THOUGHT, WELL,

15:09.530 --> 15:12.454
THAT WOULD BE
CROSSING A LINE.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.327
AND THEN I DID.

15:15.330 --> 15:19.494
I CROSSED A LINE,
I CROSSED A LINE !

15:20.830 --> 15:22.297
YOU ARE HILARIOUS.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.427
I MEAN,
WHAT IS THAT ?

15:24.430 --> 15:26.125
AM I TRYING TO BE YOU
OR SOMETHING ?

15:26.130 --> 15:28.325
I DON'T KNOW,
HOW'D YOU FEEL AFTERWARDS ?

15:28.330 --> 15:31.026
I WAS WEIRDLY
KIND OF INSPIRED,

15:31.030 --> 15:33.294
I WROTE THIS REALLY COOL
CHAPTER ABOUT IT.

15:33.300 --> 15:37.953
WELL, AS LONG AS
IT'S ALL FOR YOUR ART.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.097
YEAH.

16:06.930 --> 16:09.899
AUNT SARAH, HI.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.356
BABY !

16:11.360 --> 16:13.351
IS EVERYTHING OKAY ?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.590
YEAH.

16:17.230 --> 16:20.358
OH, I THOUGHT WE SAID
A "PROBABLY-MAYBE"

16:20.360 --> 16:22.624
ABOUT NEXT WEEKEND.

16:22.630 --> 16:24.951
BUT THIS WEEKEND
IS FINE.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.451
IT'S JUST FINE !

16:29.000 --> 16:31.195
I THOUGHT
IT WAS THIS WEEKEND.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.590
I'M TOTALLY COOL TO GO HOME
AND COME BACK WHENEVER.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.125
NO, YOU'RE HERE
AND YOU'RE MINE.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.519
I HAVE TO BELIEVE
THE UNIVERSE SENT YOU.

16:39.530 --> 16:41.657
IT'S OUR ANNUAL
HOWL WEEKEND.

16:41.660 --> 16:44.527
ALAN GINSBERG "HOWL" ?

16:44.530 --> 16:46.794
YES, SO, YOU'RE DOWN !

16:46.800 --> 16:48.756
OH, WONDERFUL !

16:48.760 --> 16:51.228
HE WAS A DEAR,
DEAR FRIEND.

16:51.230 --> 16:53.391
WE ONCE SHARED
A FLAT IN BERLIN...

16:53.400 --> 16:57.359
UNTIL I GOT FED UP
WITH THE PARADE OF
ARYAN STAR-FUCKER BOYS.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.429
ANYWAY. ..

16:58.430 --> 17:01.627
I'M GOING TO SUMMON
HIS ENERGY THIS WEEKEND.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.249
I'M EXPECTING
SOME VISITORS.

17:04.260 --> 17:06.694
A WONDERFUL POET
NAMED BASIL,

17:06.700 --> 17:09.396
AND THE PAINTER,
FIONA KLEINSCHMIDT,

17:09.400 --> 17:10.526
HAVE YOU HEARD OF HER ?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.849
UM--

17:11.860 --> 17:12.997
AND A COUPLE OF FREAKS,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.820
AND SOME NASTY HIPPIES
FROM MY DRUGGIE DAYS,

17:14.830 --> 17:16.354
IT'S GONNA BE A RIOT !

17:16.360 --> 17:18.328
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME ?

17:18.330 --> 17:19.558
I WOULDN'T HEAR OF IT.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.152
LET ME SHOW YOU
TO YOUR SLEEPING NOOK.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.559
I LOVE THAT BAG.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.391
WHY DID YOU
DO THAT TO ME ?

17:24.400 --> 17:25.526
Do what ?

17:25.530 --> 17:26.519
THAT !

17:26.530 --> 17:27.952
JUST CALLING ME
AND TELLING ME THAT ?

17:27.960 --> 17:29.257
IS THAT EDDIE ?

17:29.260 --> 17:30.420
DAVID.

17:30.430 --> 17:31.624
( Ruth )
DAVID ?!

17:31.630 --> 17:32.927
JUST HOLD ON
A SECOND.

17:32.930 --> 17:34.352
MOM, I'M ON THE PHONE !

17:34.360 --> 17:36.225
ARE YOU GOING TO
HAVE SUPPER TONIGHT ?

17:36.230 --> 17:37.492
I'M MAKING PORK CHOPS.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.219
NO, MOM, I WON'T BE
HAVING DINNER WITH YOU.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.525
SORRY,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

17:44.530 --> 17:45.952
YOU CALLED ME.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.396
RIGHT, I WAS CALLING
TO FIND OUT WHY YOU CALLED ME

17:49.400 --> 17:50.992
TO TELL ME
YOU GUYS BROKE UP.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.151
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW

17:54.160 --> 17:55.855
when something big
happens in my life.

17:55.860 --> 17:57.350
OH, I'M YOUR FRIEND ?

17:57.360 --> 17:59.157
A MONTH AGO YOU DIDN'T
THINK WE SHOULD
SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.219
YEAH, WELL,
THINGS CHANGE.

18:01.230 --> 18:03.596
JUST WHAT EXACTLY
IS YOUR AGENDA ?

18:03.600 --> 18:06.125
I DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA,
DAVID, OKAY ?

18:06.130 --> 18:07.620
YEAH, RIGHT.

18:09.230 --> 18:10.697
WONDERFUL.

18:10.700 --> 18:11.894
Great.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.050
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR SHARING.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.096
YEAH.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.790
SHUT UP,
JUST KEEP IT SHUT.

18:22.630 --> 18:24.393
I'M JUST EATIN'.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.391
"I'M JUST EATIN'."

18:26.400 --> 18:28.254
I SPENT MOST
OF THE 905 THINKING

18:28.260 --> 18:30.728
THAT STRIPPING
WAS GODDESS WORK,

18:30.730 --> 18:33.119
BUT I CAME AROUND
TO MY ORIGINAL POSITION

18:33.130 --> 18:34.552
WHICH IS THAT
IT'S JUST PLAIN CHEAP.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.857
HMM.

18:35.860 --> 18:38.192
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ASTONISHED
AT SOME OF THAT POLE WORK.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.895
I ONCE SAW THIS WOMAN,

18:39.900 --> 18:42.050
SHE COULD HANG UPSIDE DOWN
FROM 20 FEET IN THE AIR.

18:42.060 --> 18:45.826
SHE LOOKED LIKE
AN INVERTED JESUS.

18:45.830 --> 18:47.889
IT'S THE PVC BOOTS.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.527
THEY MAKE YOUR LEGS
STICK TO THE METAL.

18:49.530 --> 18:50.394
NO WAY.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.822
HUH !

18:51.830 --> 18:54.628
I WOULD TOTALLY TAKE
MY CLOTHES OFF ON STAGE,

18:54.630 --> 18:56.257
AT LEAST ONCE,

18:56.260 --> 18:59.058
IF I DIDN'T HARBOR A VAGUE
FEELING OF HATRED ABOUT MY BODY.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.925
YOU'RE CRAZY,
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BODY.

19:00.930 --> 19:02.591
THANK YOU.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.295
( key rattling )

19:04.300 --> 19:06.495
OH, THAT'S NATE,

19:06.500 --> 19:08.297
LISTEN, QUIET ON
THE WHOLE PROSTITUTE THING,

19:08.300 --> 19:09.824
HE WOULDN'T
BE INTO IT.

19:09.830 --> 19:11.024
WHATEVER.

19:11.030 --> 19:12.793
HEY.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.620
HEY.

19:14.630 --> 19:18.054
OH, GOD, WHERE'D YOU
GET THE HUMMUS ?

19:18.060 --> 19:21.359
OH, SORRY, I'M INCREDIBLY
RUDE AND HUNGRY.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.828
THIS IS NATE,
MY...

19:23.830 --> 19:25.297
FIANCE.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.289
HEY.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.052
THIS IS MY FRIEND,
MELISSA.

19:28.060 --> 19:31.154
COOL, WHERE'D
YOU GUYS MEET ?

19:31.160 --> 19:33.720
MELISSA'S
A CLIENT OF MINE.

19:33.730 --> 19:35.493
OH, YEAH ?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.991
SO, DOES BRENDA HAVE
ALL YOUR AURAS ALIGNED ?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.558
CHAKRAS.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.494
DID YOU NOTE
THE TONE OF MOCKING ?

19:41.500 --> 19:42.797
MM-HMM.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.928
HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS EVER HEARD OF
AUTO-EROTIC ASPHYXIATION ?

19:45.930 --> 19:49.149
CUTTING OFF YOUR AIR SUPPLY
SO YOU CAN COME HARDER ?

19:49.160 --> 19:50.457
SURE.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.098
THERE'S A NAME FOR IT
IN THE FETISH COMMUNITY,

19:52.100 --> 19:53.453
IT'S CALLED
"BREATH PLAY".

19:53.460 --> 19:56.054
I READ A THING...

19:56.060 --> 19:58.893
WE HAD THIS GUY
WHO DIED OF IT,

19:58.900 --> 20:00.993
AND IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE
IT'S DEFINITELY SUICIDE,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.629
BUT IS IT ACCIDENTAL SUICIDE
OR JUST PLAIN OLD SUICIDE ?

20:04.630 --> 20:07.952
BECAUSE HE WAS
INDULGING IN SOMETHING
HE KNEW COULD KILL HIM.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.793
BUT EVEN IF
IT'S ACCIDENTAL,

20:10.800 --> 20:12.791
IT'S STILL SORT OF
ON PURPOSE, RIGHT ?

20:12.800 --> 20:14.597
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"THIS GUY WE HAVE ?"

20:14.600 --> 20:15.851
NATE'S AN UNDERTAKER.

20:15.860 --> 20:16.997
FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.299
DID YOU NOTE THE TONE
OF MOCKING IN THAT ?

20:21.360 --> 20:24.227
OKAY, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE COUPLES

20:24.230 --> 20:26.221
THAT LIKES TO BICKER
IN FRONT OF THEIR COMPANY

20:26.230 --> 20:27.720
UNTIL IT
GETS UNCOMFORTABLE,

20:27.730 --> 20:29.152
AND I HAVE TO LEAVE
AND YOU GUYS FUCK.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.390
NO, NO.
NO, NO.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.356
NOT US.
NOT US.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.091
( phone ringing )

20:43.400 --> 20:45.197
HI.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.259
OKAY, YOU WANT
TO KNOW MY AGENDA ?

20:47.260 --> 20:50.650
MY AGENDA IS TO TAKE YOU
TO DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT.

20:52.530 --> 20:53.724
OH.

20:56.030 --> 20:57.827
YOU THERE ?

20:57.830 --> 20:59.752
WELL...

20:59.760 --> 21:04.220
IF I SAY YES,
WHAT AM I AGREEING TO ?

21:04.230 --> 21:06.721
YOU AND ME
HAVING DINNER,

21:06.730 --> 21:09.221
MAYBE A LITTLE CONVERSATION,
THAT'S ALL.

21:09.230 --> 21:12.097
DINNER, HUH ?

21:12.100 --> 21:14.523
WELL, SURE,
WE COULD MAKE A PLAN,

21:14.530 --> 21:16.350
BUT IT SEEMS
A LITTLE SOON AFTER--

21:16.360 --> 21:18.499
OH, WOULD YOU JUST
SHUT UP AND SAY YES ?

21:18.500 --> 21:20.456
YES.

21:21.230 --> 21:24.119
YES, I WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE DINNER WITH YOU

21:24.130 --> 21:26.553
TOMORROW NIGHT, KEITH.

22:33.430 --> 22:36.126
( car doors slamming )

22:36.130 --> 22:38.553
( dog barking )

22:46.500 --> 22:47.694
BASIL !

22:47.700 --> 22:49.452
HOW YOU DOIN',
BABY ?

22:49.460 --> 22:51.496
OH, BE CAREFUL.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.990
OH, SNOOPY HAS
AN EAR INFECTION.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.254
I BROUGHT TOMATOES
FROM MY GARDEN.

22:56.260 --> 22:59.127
BUT I'M MAKING
THE SAUCE, RIGHT ?

22:59.130 --> 23:01.690
DO YOU HAVE FRESH PASTA, OR
DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE SOME UP ?

23:01.700 --> 23:04.453
THE NAPA CONTINGENT
CAN'T MAKE IT,

23:04.460 --> 23:06.997
FERNANDO'S DOING
COMMUNITY SERVICE AGAIN.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.753
WHO ARE YOU ?

23:09.760 --> 23:11.591
HI.

23:11.600 --> 23:15.092
OH, THIS IS CLAIRE,
RUTH'S DAUGHTER.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.989
I DIDN'T KNOW RUTH
HAD A DAUGHTER.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.127
WELL, IF I
REMEMBER CORRECTLY

23:20.130 --> 23:22.098
YOU CERTAINLY KNEW
SHE HAD A SON.

23:22.100 --> 23:25.456
( laughing )

23:26.330 --> 23:29.299
HOW IS RUTH ?

23:29.300 --> 23:30.790
HOW IS NATHANIEL ?

23:30.800 --> 23:33.951
UM, RUTH'S,
MY MOM'S GREAT.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.690
MY DAD IS NOT SO GREAT,
HE'S DEAD.

23:36.700 --> 23:40.454
OH, SHAME,
HELLUVA GUY, YOUR DAD.

23:40.460 --> 23:44.248
SO FUNNY,
FUCKING WICKED.

23:44.260 --> 23:46.421
( laughing )

23:46.430 --> 23:48.694
I MEAN, I CAN STILL SEE HIM
SITTING AT THIS COUNTER,

23:48.700 --> 23:50.725
HUNCHED OVER HIS
LITTLE ROLLING MACHINE.

23:50.730 --> 23:54.393
HE USED
A ROLLING MACHINE !

23:58.860 --> 24:01.920
HEY, SO, I'M GONNA
HAVE MY CELL PHONE ON,

24:01.930 --> 24:03.625
IN CASE YOU GUYS NEED
TO CALL ME OR ANYTHING, OKAY ?

24:03.630 --> 24:04.824
OKAY, BABY,
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

24:04.830 --> 24:06.718
YOU WANT ANOTHER
CUP OF COFFEE ?

24:06.730 --> 24:08.129
IF YOU MAKE IT,
I'LL DRINK IT.

24:08.130 --> 24:11.452
HEY, BE REALLY CAREFUL WHEN
YOU'RE TAKING DOWN THIS PLASTIC,

24:11.460 --> 24:13.098
'CAUSE OF
JULIO'S ALLERGIES,

24:13.100 --> 24:15.091
THERE'S TONS OF DUST
ALL THROUGH HERE.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.294
OKAY, BRO,
I GOT IT.

24:16.300 --> 24:19.019
WE KNOW, HONEY,

24:19.030 --> 24:22.022
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME BREAKFAST,
ARE YOU HUNGRY ?

24:22.030 --> 24:23.520
YEAH,
SOUNDS GOOD.

24:23.530 --> 24:28.558
HEY, I MOVED YOUR CIRCULAR SAW
TO THE PORCH.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.699
I KNOW, MAN, I GOT IT,
IT'S COOL.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.427
HONEY, LISTEN...

24:35.430 --> 24:38.399
IF IT GETS TOO LOUD IN HERE,
YOU CAN TAKE THE KIDS

24:38.400 --> 24:40.493
TO THE PARK,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY--

24:40.500 --> 24:42.491
OKAY, BABY, I GOT IT,
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.695
OKAY.
OKAY.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.123
JULIO,
TURN THAT TV DOWN !

24:59.360 --> 25:03.456
THERE'S A SPRAY CLEANER
THAT'S MUCH MORE EARTH-FRIENDLY,

25:03.460 --> 25:04.996
MAYBE I'LL ORDER IT.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.025
OH, GODDAMNIT !

25:07.030 --> 25:09.123
OR WE CAN
KEEP USING THIS.

25:09.130 --> 25:11.553
I'M NOT TALKING
TO YOU !

25:11.560 --> 25:13.824
ARE YOU MAD AT US ?

25:13.830 --> 25:16.924
WHY THE GRUMPS,
MR. CRANKY-PANTS ?

25:16.930 --> 25:18.090
SHUSH !

25:18.100 --> 25:20.091
SOMEONE'S
IN A REAL SNOOT.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.522
I DON'T THINK
HE'S FEELING WELL.

25:21.530 --> 25:23.191
I'M FEELING FINE.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.419
I CAN'T COME TO YOUR HOUSE
FOR DINNER TONIGHT,

25:26.430 --> 25:28.227
I HAVE
OTHER OBLIGATION.

25:28.230 --> 25:30.027
WE PLANNED THIS
THREE DAYS AGO.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.850
I BOUGHT AUBERGINES.

25:31.860 --> 25:34.658
I CAN'T,
I CAN'T,
I CAN'T !

25:34.660 --> 25:36.525
STOP WITH ALL THE QUESTIONS,
OKAY, I CAN'T !

25:36.530 --> 25:38.555
I'M NOT ASKING
YOU QUESTIONS.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.959
I HAVEN'T ASKED YOU
ANY QUESTIONS !

25:39.960 --> 25:43.054
SO, TELL, TELL, TELL.

25:43.060 --> 25:45.028
WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH AUBERGINES ?

25:45.030 --> 25:47.919
IT'S A GREEK THING,
IT'S LIKE A...

25:57.200 --> 26:00.454
IT'S LIKE A LASAGNA.

26:01.300 --> 26:04.121
ROBBIE...

26:07.400 --> 26:11.222
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT ?

26:13.360 --> 26:17.820
NOTHING WOULD
PLEASE ME MORE, MUFFIN.

26:23.130 --> 26:24.620
STAR SIGHTING,

26:24.630 --> 26:26.450
I THINK I JUST SAW
THE JEWISH FRIEND IN THERE.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.859
WHAT, JENNIFER ANISTON ?

26:27.860 --> 26:29.088
THE GUY.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.556
RIGHT.
ROSS.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.050
I'LL BE BACK
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

26:32.060 --> 26:32.890
HEY, YOU FORGET
TO SHAVE ?

26:32.900 --> 26:34.253
YEAH, I WAS
RUNNING LATE.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.796
OH, REALLY ?

26:35.800 --> 26:39.156
YES, AND I'LL
THANK YOU NOT TO DISCUSS
MY FACIAL HAIR ANY FURTHER.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.957
COME HERE,
LET ME CHECK IT OUT.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.359
C'MON.

26:42.860 --> 26:45.158
WHAT TIME'S YOUR DATE ?

26:45.160 --> 26:46.855
WHO SAID
I HAVE A DATE ?

26:46.860 --> 26:49.693
TONIGHT, DINNER.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.998
THAT'S A LITTLE SOON.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.026
THE WHOLE "OOPS, I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS SEXY", STUBBLE-LOOK,

26:55.030 --> 26:57.248
WILL ACTUALLY PEAK
AT AROUND...

26:57.260 --> 26:59.125
NOON TOMORROW.

26:59.130 --> 27:01.018
BELIEVE ME,
I'VE PERFECT ED THE ART.

27:01.030 --> 27:03.692
CAN YOU MAKE IT
DRINKS AFTER DINNER ?

27:03.700 --> 27:05.156
THAT'LL GIVE YOU
ANOTHER COUPLE HOURS.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.821
I CAN'T DISCUSS THIS
RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING OUT.

27:06.830 --> 27:07.956
CLOTHES SHOPPING ?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.120
NO.

27:09.130 --> 27:10.950
STAY OUT OF
"STRUCTURE".

27:12.900 --> 27:13.889
NATE.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.427
HEY, AUGUSTO'S
GOT A LITTLE COLD.

27:17.430 --> 27:21.127
SO, I'M GONNA HEAD HOME
AND GIVE VANESSA A LITTLE BREAK.

27:21.130 --> 27:23.189
OKAY, THAT'S COOL.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.521
I'LL BE
RIGHT HERE, THEN.

27:25.530 --> 27:27.896
OKAY.

27:39.930 --> 27:55.995
( singing in Hebrew )

28:29.600 --> 28:33.058
YOU MAY BE SEATED.

28:36.130 --> 28:40.123
WE ARE HERE TODAY
TO MOURN THE LOSS

28:40.130 --> 28:42.018
OF JEFFREY MARK SHAPIRO.

28:42.030 --> 28:45.352
THE TALMUD SAYS,
"BETTER IS ONE DAY IN THIS LIFE,

28:45.360 --> 28:49.524
THAN ALL ETERNITY
IN THE WORLD TO COME."

28:49.530 --> 28:53.853
AND IF THEY ASK,
YOU ANSWER.

28:53.860 --> 28:59.127
DAMN HIGH-WALLED,
GUARD TOWERS OF RIGHT AND LEFT,

28:59.130 --> 29:03.692
COAST TO COAST,
NOW HERE UPON A TIME,

29:03.700 --> 29:07.659
WHERE LEAF
SHINE SHIMMERS,

29:07.660 --> 29:10.720
TOKES TO TOASTS.

29:10.730 --> 29:16.088
FEAR FOREVER
AND NEVER MORE.

29:17.230 --> 29:20.028
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT,
THE CRAP OF THE MOMENT !

29:20.030 --> 29:23.693
OH, LOOK WHAT
JUST ARRIVED.

29:23.700 --> 29:27.693
HEY, HEY,
MAGIC MUSHROOMS.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.850
SPECIAL DELIVERY.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.896
( female )
THROW THEM
IN THE SAUCE !

29:31.900 --> 29:35.529
NO, SAUTE THEM FIRST,
YOU GUYS, SAUTE THEM FIRST !

29:35.530 --> 29:37.794
DO YOU HAVE ANY
OF THAT THC BUTTER

29:37.800 --> 29:39.654
IN THE FREEZER
FROM LAST YEAR ?

29:44.360 --> 29:47.124
( music playing )

29:49.660 --> 29:54.620
( moaning )

30:09.900 --> 30:11.720
HEY !

30:11.730 --> 30:12.924
WHAT THE FUCK ?

30:12.930 --> 30:14.124
OH, FUCK.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.592
FUCK.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.693
WHAT THE FUCK ?

30:19.700 --> 30:23.625
WHAT THE FUCK IS
GOING ON IN HERE ?

30:23.630 --> 30:25.154
( Ramon )
JUST GET OUT OF HERE,
MAN, GIVE ME A SEC !

30:25.160 --> 30:26.297
GET OUT OF HERE ?!

30:26.300 --> 30:29.519
THIS IS MY FUCKING HOUSE,
YOU FUCKING HOMO !

30:29.530 --> 30:31.521
JUST CHILL, RICO, DAMN.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.418
ARE YOU OUT OF
YOUR FUCKING MIND ?

30:33.430 --> 30:35.398
MY KIDS COULD'VE
SEEN THAT !

30:35.400 --> 30:37.197
VAN ESSA, VANESSA !

30:37.200 --> 30:38.690
SHE TOOK THE KIDS
TO THE PARK.

30:39.930 --> 30:42.057
ARE YOU OUT OF
YOUR FUCKING HOMO MIND, HUH ?

30:42.060 --> 30:43.652
GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE !

30:43.660 --> 30:46.322
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG
WITH YOU, RAMON ?!

30:46.330 --> 30:48.195
DO YOU GOT ANYTHING
TO FUCKIN' SAY ?!

30:48.200 --> 30:50.418
NAH, I'M JUST GONNA
GET OUTTA HERE,

30:50.430 --> 30:51.988
UNTIL YOU CALM
THE HELL DOWN, OKAY, GUY ?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.991
DAMN !

30:55.530 --> 30:57.725
WHAT THE FUCK ?

30:58.500 --> 31:02.220
WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK ?!

31:03.860 --> 31:05.657
UH, RABBI ?

31:05.660 --> 31:07.059
YOU CAN
CALL ME ARI.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.391
I NEED TO,
UM...

31:08.400 --> 31:09.924
ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS...

31:09.930 --> 31:11.955
WELL, AS A FUNERAL DIRECTOR,
I WANT TO ASK YOU

31:11.960 --> 31:13.996
A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT DEATH
FROM A JEWISH POINT OF VIEW.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.149
SURE.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.094
ALTHOUGH,
I SHOULD WARN YOU,

31:17.100 --> 31:18.852
JEWS TEND TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
WITH MORE QUESTIONS.

31:18.860 --> 31:20.157
I'LL GIVE YOU
MY CARD.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.297
WELL, I MEAN NOW.

31:21.300 --> 31:24.258
OH, WELL, WE'RE GOING
STRAIGHT TO THE CEMETERY.

31:24.260 --> 31:28.196
YOU COULD
DRIVE WITH ME.

31:29.430 --> 31:32.092
OKAY.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.796
( doorbell ringing )

31:34.800 --> 31:37.257
I'M COMING !

31:42.030 --> 31:44.089
MOTHER.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.658
BABY.

31:45.660 --> 31:48.595
OH, I GOT THIS
FOR YOU,

31:48.600 --> 31:51.797
IT DOESN'T NEED WATERING
OR CARING ABOUT IN ANY WAY.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.291
SO, BRENDA...

31:54.300 --> 31:57.724
I HAD THIS VISION
OF YOUR WEDDING AT
THE HOLLY HOCK HOUSE.

31:57.730 --> 32:01.291
THEY'RE WONDERFUL AS LONG AS
YOU BRING IN YOUR OWN CATERER.

32:01.300 --> 32:04.155
LULU SMIGEL'S DAUGHTER
HAD HER WEDDING THERE.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.425
WELL, ACTUALLY I WAS
THINKING OF SOMEWHERE

32:07.430 --> 32:09.318
MORE BEAUTIFUL
AND NATURAL.

32:09.330 --> 32:11.958
OH, GOD.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.297
WHAT ?

32:14.300 --> 32:16.256
WELL, YOU KNOW,

32:16.260 --> 32:18.626
YOUR FATHER AND I
GOT MARRIED ON THE BEACH,

32:18.630 --> 32:21.929
WE RAN ON
THE SURF AFTERWARDS.

32:21.930 --> 32:23.989
YEAH, I KNOW.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.719
YOU WERE BAREFOOT,
HE WORE CLOGS.

32:29.160 --> 32:34.097
BRENDA, I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE.

32:34.100 --> 32:39.197
I'VE JUST GOT SO MUCH
COMING UP RIGHT NOW.

32:39.200 --> 32:44.820
AND I NEED TO GO IN MY ROOM
AND SOB FOR AN HOUR.

32:46.630 --> 32:50.623
LOOK, I COULD STAY,
I'LL MASSAGE YOUR SHOULDERS.

32:50.630 --> 32:53.690
NO, NO...

32:53.700 --> 32:57.989
IT DOESN'T HELP ME RIGHT NOW
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

32:59.400 --> 33:02.449
YOU SURE I CAN'T MAKE YOU
A CUP OF TEA OR SOMETHING ?

33:02.460 --> 33:05.793
I'M SURE,
AND BRENDA...

33:05.800 --> 33:10.328
PLEASE DON'T TELL YOUR FATHER
THAT YOU SAW ME CRY.

33:10.330 --> 33:12.218
AW, MOM,
LET ME HELP.

33:12.230 --> 33:14.425
I'M NOT BILLY !

33:14.430 --> 33:18.150
IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME,
JUST LEAVE !

33:26.360 --> 33:28.499
OKAY.

33:38.260 --> 33:39.921
( door closing )

33:40.960 --> 33:44.748
EVERY TIME I GET A HEADACHE,
I'M THINKING THIS COULD BE IT.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.750
YOU MUST BE
REALLY SCARED.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.455
YEAH, I'M GONNA DIE.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.257
YEAH, ME TOO.

33:51.260 --> 33:53.490
REALLY,
WHAT DO YOU HAVE ?

33:53.500 --> 33:55.195
A BODY.

33:55.200 --> 34:00.058
( phone ringing )

34:02.100 --> 34:06.127
OKAY, WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE,
AND WHATEVER,

34:06.130 --> 34:12.023
MAYBE I'M GONNA DIE BEFORE
EVERYONE ELSE, MAYBE NOT.

34:13.430 --> 34:16.627
SO, WHAT'S THE JEWISH ANSWER
ON WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO NOW ?

34:16.630 --> 34:19.622
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE JEWISH ANSWER IS,

34:19.630 --> 34:21.598
I KNOW WHAT
I TRY TO DO.

34:21.600 --> 34:26.993
I TRY TO LIVE
MY LIFE EVERY DAY

34:27.000 --> 34:29.059
IN A WAY
THAT HONORS GOD.

34:30.500 --> 34:34.459
WELL, IF I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I BELIEVE IN GOD.

34:36.700 --> 34:39.055
MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO FIND HIM.

34:39.060 --> 34:41.290
MAYBE GOD'S A WOMAN.

34:41.300 --> 34:43.427
MAYBE.

34:45.660 --> 34:48.549
THERE HE IS NOW.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.097
JEFFREY SHAPIRO.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.988
OH.

34:55.830 --> 34:58.094
I'LL WAIT HERE
BY THE CAR.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.751
COME AND WATCH HIM
BE BURIED.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.228
JEFFREY
CAN'T REPAY YOU,

35:03.230 --> 35:05.721
SO IT'S CONSIDERED
A GREAT, GREAT MITZVAH.

35:05.730 --> 35:09.689
KINDNESS, LOVE,
FOR ITS OWN SAKE.

35:09.700 --> 35:14.899
SOME PEOPLE
CALL THAT GOD.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.155
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

35:21.160 --> 35:23.526
YES, DEFINITELY, FORGIVE
YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER,

35:25.400 --> 35:28.324
WHAT'S BECOME CLEAR
IS THAT MY FAMILY OF ORIGIN

35:28.330 --> 35:31.197
NEVER REALLY LIVED
IN A HOUSE,

35:31.200 --> 35:34.795
THEY LIVED IN THIS TENT CITY,
PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.189
SO, IT'S NO WONDER
THAT MY OWN HOUSE

35:37.200 --> 35:39.350
NEVER EVEN
FELT REMOTELY

35:39.360 --> 35:41.055
LIKE IT WAS BUILT
ON SOLID GROUND.

35:41.060 --> 35:44.188
( Ruth thinking )
Shut up, shut the mouth.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.851
QUICKSAND
OF EMOTIONAL INCEST,

35:46.860 --> 35:49.090
Shutting it, now.

35:49.100 --> 35:51.193
Shutting it
and stopping it.

35:51.200 --> 35:55.398
BUT THE PLAN WOULD CALL THAT
OLD BLUEPRINTING.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.049
If you say
another word,

35:57.060 --> 35:59.494
I will stab you
in the heart with a fork.

35:59.500 --> 36:03.493
If there is a God in heaven
he will surely shut your mouth.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.388
YOU NEVER
STOP RENOVATING.

36:05.400 --> 36:09.097
ROBBIE, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING NOW.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.354
I DO BELIEVE
I'VE LEARNED EVERYTHING

36:12.360 --> 36:14.021
I NEEDED TO LEARN
FROM THE PLAN.

36:14.030 --> 36:17.898
AND I NO LONGER FEEL THE URGE
TO SPEAK IN BUILDING METAPHORS,

36:17.900 --> 36:22.155
OR TALK ABOUT MYSELF
OR MY FEELINGS IN THIS WAY,

36:22.160 --> 36:25.721
ANY LONGER.

36:30.930 --> 36:32.955
OH.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.324
(sighing )

36:59.860 --> 37:02.249
( phone ringing )

37:02.260 --> 37:04.728
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF POWER TRIP YOU'RE ON,

37:04.730 --> 37:07.699
BUT IT SEEMS KIND OF CRUEL,
TO BE HONEST.

37:08.430 --> 37:09.692
OH...

37:09.700 --> 37:13.852
OH, GOD, KEITH,
YOU POOR THING.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.694
DO YOU MIND JUST CHECKING
ON HER ONE MORE TIME ?

37:18.700 --> 37:20.691
SURE.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.029
HI.

37:23.030 --> 37:24.520
HEY.

37:24.530 --> 37:25.519
HOW IS SHE ?

37:25.530 --> 37:26.929
SHE'S IN SURGERY
RIGHT NOW.

37:26.930 --> 37:28.488
I GUESS HER APPENDIX
WAS HUGE,

37:28.500 --> 37:29.990
BUT THEY GOT IT
BEFORE IT BURST,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.457
AND SHE'S GONNA BE FINE,
I'M JUST WAITING.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.655
IT'S BEEN
AN HOUR AND A HALF.

37:34.660 --> 37:38.050
SHE KEPT TELLING ME
HER STOMACH WAS HURTING,

37:38.060 --> 37:42.497
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
SOME KIND OF GAME.

37:43.660 --> 37:46.424
YOU CAN'T BE PERFECT
ALL THE TIME, KEITH.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.921
THAT'S WHAT LIFE'S ABOUT,
STRIVING FOR PERFECTION.

37:48.930 --> 37:51.797
AND WHEN THAT FAILS,

37:51.800 --> 37:53.756
ACCEPTING OURSELVES
FOR BEING IMPERFECT.

37:53.760 --> 37:55.728
NOT IN MY BOOK.

37:59.130 --> 38:01.792
GOD, YOU ARE SO
SELF-RIGHTEOUS SOMETIMES.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.620
YEAH, AND
YOU'RE A DOORMAT.

38:04.430 --> 38:08.423
DO I REALLY COME OFF
AS BEING A DOORMAT ?

38:12.800 --> 38:14.324
HOW IS SHE ?

38:14.330 --> 38:15.399
GREAT.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.958
IT WENT VERY SMOOTHLY,
SHE'S IN RECOVERY.

38:16.960 --> 38:20.418
GOOD,
WHEN CAN I SEE HER ?

38:20.430 --> 38:21.897
YOU CAN WAIT FOR HER
IN HER ROOM.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.720
WHEN SHE COMES OUT
OF HER AN ESTHESIA,

38:23.730 --> 38:27.052
SHE MIGHT BE A LITTLE WEEPY,
DON'T LET IT CONCERN YOU.

38:27.060 --> 38:29.324
THANK YOU.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.129
THANK YOU.

38:36.900 --> 38:40.722
( music playing )

38:58.160 --> 39:00.924
OH, GOD, NO,
DON'T LET HER COME OVER HERE.

39:00.930 --> 39:01.999
NO, IT'S TOO LATE.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.219
BEAT THESE GOURDS,
BEAT THESE GOURDS !

39:05.230 --> 39:09.428
NO SPECTATORS !

39:26.800 --> 39:29.257
( crowd howling )

39:37.700 --> 39:41.397
OH, MY GOD, IS THERE
A LOCK ON THIS THING ?

39:42.360 --> 39:44.954
THEY USE THIS PLACE
AS A MEDITATION HUT,

39:44.960 --> 39:47.554
BUT IT'S BEEN
MY SAFE HOUSE

39:47.560 --> 39:48.959
MORE TIMES THAN
I CARE TO REMEMBER.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.293
WHAT FUCKING FREAKS.

39:52.300 --> 39:55.497
YEAH, AT LEAST TWO OF THEM
AREN'T YOUR PARENTS.

39:55.500 --> 39:58.219
I AM THEIR
DESIGNATED DRIVER,

39:58.230 --> 40:01.597
EVERY YEAR.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.295
SORRY.

40:03.300 --> 40:06.519
IT'S BETTER THAN GETTING A CALL
FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE,

40:06.530 --> 40:09.249
SAYING YOUR PARENTS ARE LAYING
IN THE BOTTOM OF TOPANGA CANYON,

40:09.260 --> 40:12.354
AND WOULD I LIKE A RIDE
IN THE HELICOPTER.

40:27.030 --> 40:28.895
WE SHOULDN'T
BE DOING THIS.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.652
WHY NOT ?

40:30.660 --> 40:32.890
BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, LIKE...

40:32.900 --> 40:35.323
PEOPLE ARE HAVING
"END OF THE WORLD SEX",

40:35.330 --> 40:39.858
AND, JUST, I DIDN'T
BRING ANY CONDOMS, AND...

40:39.860 --> 40:42.522
LIKE I WOULD EVEN,
ANYWAY.

40:42.530 --> 40:45.124
YEAH, RIGHT.

40:45.130 --> 40:48.327
NO.

40:48.330 --> 40:50.924
NO, I MEAN
YOU'RE QUITE THE FOX,

40:50.930 --> 40:52.795
I'M HAPPY TO REPORT,
BUT, LIKE...

40:52.800 --> 40:55.496
I WOULD NEVER JUST HOOK UP
WITH SOMEBODY I JUST MET.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.855
LIKE EVER.

40:57.860 --> 40:59.589
SERIOUSLY ?

40:59.600 --> 41:02.751
SERIOUSLY.

41:05.060 --> 41:07.654
I GET IT, YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO LET ME GET MY GUARD DOWN

41:07.660 --> 41:10.390
AND THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN,
WE'RE LIKE, HOOKING UP.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.424
WRONG.

41:11.430 --> 41:14.092
I'M 19,
OKAY, CLAIRE ?

41:14.100 --> 41:16.022
I MEAN, I'VE HAD THE MAJOR
LIFE EXPERIENCE TO KNOW,

41:16.030 --> 41:19.352
IT KIND OF SUCKS
TO JUST,

41:19.360 --> 41:21.453
ENTER THE BODY
OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING

41:21.460 --> 41:23.758
YOU'RE NOT
IN LOVE WITH.

41:25.130 --> 41:27.849
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU,
LIKE STRAIGHT-EDGE,

41:27.860 --> 41:29.828
OR ALL JESUS-Y
OR JUST GAY ?

41:29.830 --> 41:32.025
NONE OF THOSE THINGS,
OKAY, FORGET IT.

41:32.030 --> 41:36.126
JUST LAY DOWN HERE
WITH ME,

41:36.130 --> 41:38.724
I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE SEX WITH YOU,

41:38.730 --> 41:40.391
THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO KNOW.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.594
WHATEVER.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.727
WHO SAID I EVEN
WANTED YOU TO ?

41:45.630 --> 41:48.224
I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

41:48.230 --> 41:50.391
THIS IS ALL GONNA
BE OVER SOON,

41:50.400 --> 41:52.459
AND WE'LL HAVE
YOU BACK HOME.

41:52.460 --> 41:54.951
I'M SORRY
I GOT SICK.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.394
BABY, IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT.

41:57.400 --> 41:59.220
YOU KEPT TRYING
TO TELL ME, I...

41:59.230 --> 42:02.290
JUST WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU.

42:02.300 --> 42:06.054
IN THE FUTURE, WE NEED
TO HAVE A CODE WORD, OKAY ?

42:06.060 --> 42:07.789
OKAY.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.621
SOME SECRET WORD
YOU CAN USE TO LET ME KNOW

42:10.630 --> 42:13.019
WHEN THE PAIN IS REAL
AND NOT JUST PLAYING.

42:13.030 --> 42:16.454
BUT IT WAS
ALWAYS REAL.

42:18.700 --> 42:20.656
I KNOW.

42:20.660 --> 42:22.321
BABY, I'M SORRY.

42:22.330 --> 42:25.128
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE DEPRESSED ABOUT,

42:25.130 --> 42:27.018
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN LAID
SINCE SEPTEMBER 11th...

42:27.030 --> 42:28.725
( laughing )

42:28.730 --> 42:30.049
1985.

42:30.060 --> 42:31.129
( laughing )

42:31.130 --> 42:32.688
YOU LAUGHED
AT THE WRONG PART,

42:32.700 --> 42:34.998
I'M JUST TELLING YOU,
WHAT A CROWD.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.150
YOU'RE DRINKIN' NYQUIL, LADIES ?
SIT UP, C'MON.

42:37.160 --> 42:40.527
BLONDE JEWS EVERYBODY,
GET PROUD.

42:40.530 --> 42:42.521
GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK
IN MEN'S CLOTHES, SENATOR.

42:42.530 --> 42:46.057
COUSIN STU RIGHT OUT OF REHAB,
GOOD TO SEE YOU...

42:46.060 --> 42:49.826
SO, WHAT,
SHIVAH MEANS STANDUP ?

42:49.830 --> 42:53.721
JEFFREY REPRESENTED
A LOT OF COMEDIANS.

42:55.430 --> 42:57.523
THERE'S ONE PART
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU,

42:57.530 --> 42:59.054
I'M ENGAGED.

42:59.060 --> 43:00.652
OH.

43:00.660 --> 43:03.595
WELL, WE COULDN'T
GO OUT ANWVAY,

43:03.600 --> 43:05.488
YOU'RE NOT JEWISH.

43:05.930 --> 43:07.488
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN--

43:07.500 --> 43:09.525
YOU WOULD
GO OUT WITH ME ?

43:09.530 --> 43:11.828
NO, I JUST SAID
I WOULDN'T.

43:11.830 --> 43:13.457
BUT IT CROSSED
YOUR MIND.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.496
I SAID
I WOULD NOT.

43:15.500 --> 43:17.195
WELL, THEN
WHY'D YOU SAY IT ?

43:17.200 --> 43:19.259
YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, C'MON.

43:19.260 --> 43:21.194
MAYBE...

43:21.200 --> 43:24.226
YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR
WHOLE ILLNESS THING,

43:24.230 --> 43:27.119
I HAVE A BIT OF
A MESSIAH COMPLEX,

43:27.130 --> 43:28.791
SAVING THE MEN.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.622
AH, YES,
THE MESSIAH COMPLEX.

43:32.630 --> 43:36.418
YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN SAVE ME.

43:36.430 --> 43:38.625
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU NEED TO DO...

43:38.630 --> 43:40.621
YOU CAN SAVE ME.

43:40.630 --> 43:42.894
IT'S REALLY GOOD
THAT YOU HAVE SOMEONE,

43:42.900 --> 43:45.698
IF ANYTHING IS GONNA
SAVE YOU, THAT WILL.

43:45.700 --> 43:47.554
YEAH.

43:47.560 --> 43:50.688
YEAH, WELL,
I HAVEN'T TOLD HER

43:50.700 --> 43:52.520
ABOUT MY WHOLE HEAD THING.

43:52.530 --> 43:56.591
HOW COULD YOU NOT
TELL YOUR SOUL MATE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

43:58.800 --> 44:01.052
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE'S MY SOUL MATE.

44:01.060 --> 44:03.790
OH, I GET IT,
SHE'S NOT YOUR SOUL MATE,

44:03.800 --> 44:05.825
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
MARRY HER, BECAUSE...

44:05.830 --> 44:06.854
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

44:06.860 --> 44:08.020
'CAUSE YOU HAVE
NOTHING BETTER TO DO,

44:08.030 --> 44:09.622
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

44:09.630 --> 44:13.452
HEY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A SOUL MATE IS, DO YOU ?

44:13.460 --> 44:17.021
A PERSON WHO MAKES YOU,
BE THE MOST "YOU",

44:17.030 --> 44:19.294
THAT YOU COULD
POSSIBLY BE.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.652
MAYBE YOUR SOUL MATE
IS THE PERSON

44:24.660 --> 44:30.656
WHO FORCES YOUR SOUL
TO GROW THE MOST.

44:32.730 --> 44:35.528
NOT ALL GROWTH
FEELS GOOD.

44:37.730 --> 44:40.119
HEY, MELISSA,
IT'S BRENDA.

44:40.130 --> 44:42.291
I'VE BEEN DRIVING AROUND
FOR HOURS,

44:42.300 --> 44:44.188
DO YOU WANNA HAVE
A DRINK OR SOMETHING ?

44:44.200 --> 44:47.089
CALL ME IF YOU
GET IN TONIGHT, OKAY, BYE.

44:47.100 --> 44:48.658
WHATEVER.

44:48.660 --> 44:54.098
( radio playing )

45:20.960 --> 45:21.528
YEAH.

45:21.530 --> 45:23.452
YOU LIKE THAT ?

45:23.460 --> 45:25.621
MMM, YEAH.

45:25.630 --> 45:28.155
OH.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.593
ARE YOU GONNA
FUCK ME ?

45:29.600 --> 45:32.125
ARE YOU
GONNA FUCK ME ?

45:32.130 --> 45:33.097
YEAH.

45:33.100 --> 45:33.953
YEAH.

45:33.960 --> 45:37.123
I'M GONNA
FUCK YOU HARD.

45:38.430 --> 45:41.422
HARDER THAN YOU'VE EVER
BEEN FUCKED IN YOUR LIFE.

45:41.430 --> 45:42.692
OH, GOOD.

45:42.700 --> 45:44.349
( honking )

45:44.360 --> 45:46.851
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

45:48.430 --> 45:51.024
(tires screeching )

45:57.230 --> 46:00.996
THANK YOU FOR COMING,
MR. FISHER.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.093
I'M GLAD TO.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.991
DID HE--

46:14.000 --> 46:17.049
DID HE WANT TO DIE ?

46:17.060 --> 46:20.029
DID HE WANT
TO LEAVE US ?

46:20.030 --> 46:22.828
HOW COULD HE
HAVE WANTED THAT ?

46:22.830 --> 46:24.229
I DON'T KNOW.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.851
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

46:31.860 --> 46:36.991
I DON'T THINK
HE WANTED TO DIE.

46:43.830 --> 46:47.220
NATE,
LEAVE YOUR CLOTHES ON.

46:47.230 --> 46:50.097
I'LL GET NAKED,

46:50.100 --> 46:52.625
YOU CAN GO OUTSIDE
AND COME BACK
AS A DANGEROUS INTRUDER.

46:52.630 --> 46:54.393
HMM.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.197
NATE, C'MON,
I'M SERIOUS.

46:56.200 --> 46:59.158
IT'LL BE FUN.

46:59.160 --> 47:01.458
I'LL PRETEND
I'M ASLEEP,

47:01.460 --> 47:05.999
AND THEN YOU CAN COME IN
AND HAVE YOUR WAY WITH ME.

47:09.460 --> 47:11.724
I DON'T REALLY
FEEL LIKE IT, ALRIGHT ?

47:11.730 --> 47:13.357
OKAY.

47:13.360 --> 47:16.591
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE,
JUST DO IT FROM IN HERE.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.225
HEY.

47:23.230 --> 47:27.428
I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU BEFORE,

47:27.430 --> 47:30.058
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

47:30.060 --> 47:31.152
NATE.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.957
MY NAME IS NATE.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.393
THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.823
MY FIANCE'S NAME
IS NATE.

47:36.830 --> 47:38.149
SHH...

47:55.000 --> 47:57.298
I LOVE YOU

47:58.560 --> 48:00.858
YOU'RE
SO SOFT, BABY.

48:00.860 --> 48:03.454
I LOVE YOU.

48:03.460 --> 48:05.394
I LOVE YOU,
SO MUCH.

48:05.400 --> 48:08.392
HARDER, HARDER.

48:10.230 --> 48:12.255
C'MON.

48:13.160 --> 48:16.027
( moaning )

49:19.200 --> 49:23.796
(Joni Mitchell playing )

50:01.060 --> 50:03.199
DID THE MUSIC
WAKE YOU UP ?

50:03.200 --> 50:05.589
OH, NO, I'VE BEEN UP
FOR A WHILE ACTUALLY,

50:05.600 --> 50:07.192
I TOOK A WALK
IN THE CANYON.

50:07.200 --> 50:08.519
BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT ?

50:08.530 --> 50:11.090
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S GORGEOUS.

50:14.730 --> 50:16.550
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A WEEKEND SOON,

50:16.560 --> 50:17.993
JUST YOU AND ME, OKAY ?

50:18.000 --> 50:19.797
YOU'LL COME BACK WHEN
THERE'S NOT SO MUCH CRAZINESS.

50:19.800 --> 50:23.452
THE CRAZINESS WAS TOTALLY FINE,
IT WAS FUN, ACTUALLY.

50:23.460 --> 50:25.724
GOOD.

50:27.160 --> 50:30.789
I LOVE THIS SONG,
IT'S SO PRETTY.

50:30.800 --> 50:31.858
MMM.

50:31.860 --> 50:33.657
YOU WANT A WAFFLE
BEFORE YOU GO ?

50:33.660 --> 50:36.857
OH, NO THANKS.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.757
WELL THEN, TELL EVERYONE
I LOVE THEM AND MISS THEM,

50:43.760 --> 50:46.422
AND WANT THEM TO GET THEIR BUTTS
HERE SUPER SOON, OKAY ?

50:46.430 --> 50:48.489
ESPECIALLY THAT
MAMA OF YOURS.

50:48.500 --> 50:53.028
YEAH, RIGHT,
LIKE SHE WOULD EVER.

50:54.760 --> 50:58.753
YOU KNOW, I THINK
SHE HIDES INSIDE OF HERSELF,

50:58.760 --> 51:01.251
BECAUSE SHE'S SO AFRAID
WE'LL REJECT HER.

51:01.260 --> 51:04.354
SO, LET'S DON'T,
OKAY ?

51:04.360 --> 51:09.229
SHE'S HAD ENOUGH HEARTACHE
FOR ONE LIFETIME.

51:15.330 --> 51:17.355
YOU CAN KEEP IT,
SWEETHEART.

51:17.360 --> 51:18.998
THAN KS.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.821
AS SOON AS I CAN FIGURE OUT
WHICH TWO ARE MY PARENTS,

51:26.830 --> 51:29.094
I'M JUST GONNA
ROLL THEM UP IN A RUG

51:29.100 --> 51:30.522
AND THROW 'EM
IN MY TRUNK.

51:30.530 --> 51:32.293
LET ME KNOW
IF I CAN HELP.

51:32.300 --> 51:33.824
I THINK I'LL START
WITH SOME COFFEE,

51:33.830 --> 51:35.752
BUT GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER
IF YOU'RE TAKING OFF.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.297
SERIOUSLY ?

51:38.300 --> 51:41.019
I FIGURED
I'D NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

51:41.030 --> 51:43.225
WELL, YOU WERE WRONG.

51:43.230 --> 51:44.697
I'LL COME
INTO THE CITY.

51:44.700 --> 51:48.796
OKAY, I'LL WRITE DOWN
MY NUMBER.

51:52.130 --> 51:55.998
SO, YOU GET THE 8X10
AND THE 24 WALLET SIZES

51:56.000 --> 51:57.456
FOR UNDER 20 BUCKS.

51:57.460 --> 52:00.623
PEDRO IS
THE SPITTING IMAGE
OF RAMON.

52:00.630 --> 52:01.858
RIGHT ?

52:01.860 --> 52:03.350
AND EVERYBODY SAID
HE LOOKED JUST LIKE ME

52:03.360 --> 52:04.725
FOR THE LONGEST TIME.

52:04.730 --> 52:06.948
MORNING, BABY.

52:06.960 --> 52:11.249
HEY, HEY, GRACIELA.

52:11.260 --> 52:14.593
SO, RICO, RAMON TOLD ME WHY
HE'S NOT FINISHING YOUR HOUSE.

52:14.600 --> 52:16.989
HE DID ?

52:17.000 --> 52:20.788
YEAH, JUST BECAUSE
HE HAS DIFFERENT TASTE

52:20.800 --> 52:22.097
IN TILE THAN YOU DO.

52:22.100 --> 52:23.829
I MEAN, YOU COULD'VE
RETURNED WHAT HE BOUGHT,

52:23.830 --> 52:24.854
AND GOT SOMETHING ELSE.

52:24.860 --> 52:28.455
YEAH, I GUESS
I COULD HAVE.

52:28.460 --> 52:30.894
I KNOW, GIRL,
IT SOUNDS CRAZY TO ME TOO,

52:30.900 --> 52:32.322
BUT YOU KNOW
HOW MEN ARE.

52:32.330 --> 52:34.423
LOCO WITH THAT
MACHISMO STUFF.

52:34.430 --> 52:37.752
I GUESS I JUST REALLY WANTED
TO DO MY OWN HOUSE MYSELF.

52:37.760 --> 52:40.251
MY WAY.

52:40.260 --> 52:42.319
YOU KNOW HOW
TO DO CONSTRUCTION ?

52:42.330 --> 52:44.548
YEAH, WELL,
I WANT TO LEARN.

52:44.560 --> 52:46.949
YOU KNOW,
I GOT SOME BOOKS, AND...

52:46.960 --> 52:48.825
THAT'S COOL, BUT JUST
DON'T HOLD A GRUDGE, OKAY ?

52:48.830 --> 52:52.095
OKAY, LISTEN,
I GOTTA GO,

52:52.100 --> 52:54.125
RAMON'S WATCHING THE KIDS
AND HE'S GONNA KILL ME.

52:54.130 --> 52:55.290
OKAY, GIRL.

52:55.300 --> 52:56.597
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

53:00.330 --> 53:03.754
BABY, YOU'RE SUCH
A WEIRDO SOMETIMES.

53:05.300 --> 53:07.450
WHATEVER.

53:08.600 --> 53:10.727
( door closing )

53:32.330 --> 53:35.094
ARE YOU EVEN GONNA
ASK ABOUT MY WEEKEND ?

53:35.100 --> 53:37.898
I WASN'T
PLANNING ON IT.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.455
I HAD FUN.

53:42.460 --> 53:44.394
I'M GLAD.

53:46.360 --> 53:49.557
I FOUND SOME SLUGS
IN THE GARDEN.

53:52.030 --> 53:54.123
N EAT.

53:58.500 --> 54:02.322
I'M GONNA
GO TAKE A NAP.

54:20.260 --> 54:22.353
( opening and closing
cassette player)

54:22.360 --> 54:26.353
AND I DREAMED
I SAW THE BOMBERS

54:26.360 --> 54:31.093
RIDING SHOTGUN
IN THE SKY

54:31.100 --> 54:37.551
AND THEY WERE
TURNING INTO BUTTERFLIES

54:37.560 --> 54:43.055
ABOVE OUR NATION

54:43.060 --> 54:48.521
WE ARE STARDUST

54:48.530 --> 54:53.797
A BILLION
YEAR OLD CARBON

54:53.800 --> 54:57.395
WE ARE GOLDEN

54:57.400 --> 55:02.394
CAUGHT IN
THE DEVIL'S BARGAIN

55:02.400 --> 55:06.848
AND WE'VE GOT
TO GET OURSELVES

55:06.860 --> 55:15.359
BACK TO THE GARDEN
