WEBVTT

00:59.761 --> 01:03.565
Shh.
You guys, quiet.
Gonna find us.

01:13.575 --> 01:14.676
Shh!

01:25.485 --> 01:27.889
Girls,
what the hell is going on?

01:31.391 --> 01:33.226
I thought I told you
to play outside.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.394
We are.

02:07.427 --> 02:11.465
<i>In the summer,</i>
<i>while it lasts...</i>

02:11.498 --> 02:13.668
<i>...everything's alive.</i>

02:13.701 --> 02:15.268
<i>Anything's possible.</i>

02:17.237 --> 02:19.439
<i>At least it feels that way.</i>

02:26.914 --> 02:28.916
<i>It's so bright</i>
<i>this time of year.</i>

02:29.984 --> 02:31.919
<i>The ground is warm to the touch.</i>

02:32.820 --> 02:36.256
<i>The air is sticky and hot.</i>

02:37.324 --> 02:41.328
<i>Everything blooms</i>
<i>or drifts or hums.</i>

02:41.361 --> 02:45.198
<i>The color of flowers.</i>
<i>The taste of ice cream.</i>

02:45.900 --> 02:47.502
<i>My friends' laughter.</i>

02:47.535 --> 02:50.705
This one time at this concert,
the line was so long

02:50.738 --> 02:53.541
that my mom made me use
the boys' bathroom.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.910
There was pee everywhere.

02:55.943 --> 02:59.379
It was like a lake of man pee.

03:00.615 --> 03:01.916
It was gross.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.585
<i>So much of everything</i>

03:04.619 --> 03:06.821
<i>feels like</i>
<i>it's spilling out everywhere.</i>

03:08.556 --> 03:11.793
<i>Like I could drown</i>
<i>in all the life around me.</i>

03:16.030 --> 03:17.098
Baby powder.

03:18.833 --> 03:21.836
My mom doesn't believe in
antiperspirant and deodorant.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.505
Yeah,
we've noticed.

03:25.740 --> 03:28.643
<i>Dad used to say,</i>
<i>after the fireworks are done</i>

03:28.676 --> 03:30.343
<i>on the Fourth of July...</i>

03:30.377 --> 03:32.013
<i>...you can still see them.</i>

03:32.046 --> 03:34.949
<i>Their colors stay in your eyes</i>

03:34.982 --> 03:37.552
<i>even though the light</i>
<i>is already gone.</i>

03:38.452 --> 03:40.521
<i>That's how August feels.</i>

03:40.555 --> 03:43.624
<i>It's like the good part</i>
<i>is fading.</i>

03:46.561 --> 03:48.395
Let's put this on the altar.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.497
We're going to Terabithia?

03:50.531 --> 03:54.267
Of course we're going.
It's the last weekend.
How can we not go?

03:56.938 --> 04:00.742
<i>Sometimes I worry I'll be</i>
<i>the last one to get a phone</i>

04:00.775 --> 04:05.580
<i>or pierce my ears</i>
<i>or have my first kiss.</i>

04:07.048 --> 04:11.753
<i>Sometimes I worry</i>
<i>I need my friends</i>
<i>more than they need me.</i>

04:11.786 --> 04:14.021
I'm trying to decide
between bubble gum
or Jolly Ranchers.

04:14.055 --> 04:16.323
<i>But it's harder to be sad</i>

04:16.958 --> 04:18.926
<i>when the sun is so huge...</i>

04:18.960 --> 04:22.063
Thank you so much.
<i>...and so bright.</i>

04:22.096 --> 04:24.732
Well,
I was watching
this one movie.

04:24.766 --> 04:28.569
It was, like, these kids,
and they were looking
at roosters and hens.

04:28.603 --> 04:32.673
And I guess, like,
hens don't strut
and roosters do.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.076
What do you mean, strut?
Like the way that they walk.

04:35.109 --> 04:38.579
- Give us an example, please.
- Yeah, like they walk...

04:38.613 --> 04:41.816
I'll go in front
and walk like this.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.585
You remind me of,
like, camp counselors
that are like,

04:44.619 --> 04:47.021
"Okay, kids!
Okay, children!"

04:47.054 --> 04:50.490
"Let's go. Line up. Line up."
"Quiet. Quiet, Coyote.
Quiet, Coyote."

04:50.525 --> 04:52.026
Guys, do you guys see that?

04:52.059 --> 04:54.061
Who likes jellyfish?

04:54.095 --> 04:57.598
They're beautiful.
I love jellyfish.
They're really pretty.

04:57.632 --> 04:59.834
But they sting.
I like seahorses.
They're really pretty.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.003
So do bees,
but bees aren't...

05:02.036 --> 05:03.470
<i>Sometimes...</i>

05:03.504 --> 05:05.338
You know what
my favorite sea animal is?

05:05.372 --> 05:08.042
<i>...my house has</i>
<i>so many shadows in it...</i>

05:08.976 --> 05:10.377
<i>...it feels heavy.</i>

05:11.478 --> 05:14.015
<i>Like it could sink</i>
<i>into the earth.</i>

05:15.683 --> 05:17.985
<i>But I never feel that way</i>
<i>with my friends.</i>

05:18.019 --> 05:19.352
Come on, guys.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.422
Come on!

05:22.455 --> 05:24.424
<i>Summer has no wants.</i>

05:25.593 --> 05:27.327
<i>You can go anywhere,</i>

05:28.428 --> 05:29.730
<i>see everything.</i>

05:33.701 --> 05:37.004
I can't believe
you have to wear a skirt
every day at your new school.

05:37.038 --> 05:38.072
I know.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.441
I hate skirts.

05:42.677 --> 05:43.511
Yeah.

05:44.912 --> 05:49.083
They're so patriarchal.
Yeah.

05:49.116 --> 05:53.120
I mean, they make me feel like
something's gonna literally
fly up my butt.

05:53.154 --> 05:57.490
I don't know.
I think it might be
kind of nice.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.062
Something flying up
your butt?
No.

06:01.095 --> 06:04.532
Not having to worry about
what to wear each day, I mean.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.805

06:56.017 --> 07:00.121
I want a more classic name.
Daisy's so plain.

07:00.154 --> 07:04.491
It's like being called
Dandelion.
It's like I'm a weed.

07:04.525 --> 07:08.763
Maybe we should
change our names
when we go to middle school.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.732
My name would be something cool

07:11.766 --> 07:14.568
like Taylor Swift or Beyoncé.

07:14.602 --> 07:18.806
But like my own thing.
You'd hear it and you'd go,
"That's cool."

07:18.839 --> 07:19.874
Yeah.

07:20.975 --> 07:22.475
Switchblade.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.912
Medusa.

07:24.946 --> 07:26.647
Tangerine.

07:28.149 --> 07:29.617
Tangerine?
Tangerine?

07:29.650 --> 07:32.787
What?
It's a great name.
So cool.

07:34.055 --> 07:36.090
It's a fruit.

07:36.123 --> 07:41.195
Every step you take,
you're moving forward
a moment in time.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.166
But what if
the opposite were true?

07:45.199 --> 07:48.102
What if for every step
you take backwards,

07:48.135 --> 07:50.470
you move backwards in time?

07:53.641 --> 07:57.812
Yeah, I want to go backwards.
Not forward.

07:57.845 --> 08:01.182
Let's go back,
like, two months.

08:01.215 --> 08:04.185
Then we can have summer
all over again.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.957
But what if we accidentally
go back too far

08:09.991 --> 08:12.960
and we all turn into a bunch
of little diaper babies?

08:12.994 --> 08:15.196
What if we go too far forward

08:15.229 --> 08:17.531
and become old ladies?

08:17.565 --> 08:19.900
Then we'll also
have diapers.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.738
At least then
we wouldn't have to go
to middle school.

08:23.771 --> 08:27.708
We could just sit around
eating soup
in our rocking chairs.

08:29.110 --> 08:31.912
Speaking of soup,
I'm a little hungry.

08:33.147 --> 08:36.017
It's almost dinner.
We better get moving.

08:36.050 --> 08:38.953
We've got to pay our respects.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.621
Terabithia awaits.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.010
Hello!

09:12.386 --> 09:13.821
There she is.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.894
All hail Terabithia.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.228
All hail.

09:23.264 --> 09:26.167
We bring you incense

09:26.901 --> 09:28.002
and myrrh

09:29.036 --> 09:31.072
and gum.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.220
Hey!

09:47.254 --> 09:48.289
Daisy?

09:50.758 --> 09:51.826
What is it?

09:54.261 --> 09:55.296
I-I don't know.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.247
Oh, my...

10:26.827 --> 10:28.162
That can't be real.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.763
Of course it's real.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.732
Go look.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.134
Not me. You go.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.136
You go.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.938
Somebody...

10:44.145 --> 10:46.113
He's dead?

10:48.182 --> 10:50.184
I don't think
I want to see that.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.919
Oh, my God.

12:53.474 --> 12:56.511
San Juan Valley.
San Fernando Valley.
San Juan...

12:56.544 --> 12:58.112
San Luis Obispo!

12:58.145 --> 12:59.880
That's not even
the right amount of letters.

12:59.913 --> 13:04.051
-Okay. Okay.
San, San, San, San.
-San? Stop saying San!

13:04.084 --> 13:06.387
New Haven!
New Haven, Connecticut!

13:06.420 --> 13:09.591
-New Haven, Connecticut! Yes!
-We know. Thanks, Mom.

13:09.624 --> 13:12.459
Hey, honey.
I've got food for you.

13:17.532 --> 13:20.167
What Ivy League University
is located in New Haven?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.537
- Yale.
- Is the correct answer.

13:22.570 --> 13:25.507
-What is the capital
of Connecticut?
-Hartford.

13:25.540 --> 13:27.141
Yes.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.442
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>Give me a letter.</i>

13:30.210 --> 13:32.446
<i>The puzzle.</i>
<i>You'll have ten seconds</i>
<i>to solve it.</i>

13:32.479 --> 13:35.916
- So what'd you do today?
- Um...

13:35.949 --> 13:38.553
-Played. Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah? Played where?

13:38.586 --> 13:40.287
Just around.

13:40.321 --> 13:43.857
Mari's, the park,
got ice cream.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.427
Are you stressed?
You seem stressed.

13:46.460 --> 13:49.029
I'm not stressed, Mom.

13:49.063 --> 13:51.599
Something happen today?
You girls fight?

13:51.633 --> 13:53.467
Mom, I said
I'm not stressed, okay?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.069
Did you take
your medication
this morning?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.270
Mom, I'm fine.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.238
You sure? Okay.

13:58.272 --> 14:01.008
<i>We have 20 seconds for you.</i>

14:02.610 --> 14:04.378
Where's Dad?

14:04.411 --> 14:08.449
Oh, he's just, uh--
just having
his after-dinner...

14:09.483 --> 14:10.618
- <i>N.</i>
- ...you know.

14:11.452 --> 14:12.953
<i>One N.</i>

14:12.986 --> 14:15.022
Don't forget
to light the candle,
hon.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.390
What?

14:16.423 --> 14:19.594
Don't forget
to light the candle!

14:47.655 --> 14:48.889
Lola?

14:50.157 --> 14:51.191
Hey, kiddo.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.661
-Hey.
-What's going on?

14:56.296 --> 14:58.198
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.508
What are you worried about
that you need to burn lavender?

15:09.611 --> 15:11.011
Is it middle school?

15:13.648 --> 15:14.982
I'd be nervous too.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.520
Those are some tough years.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.221
In some ways
they're the toughest years

15:21.255 --> 15:24.324
because it can be so hard
to find your center

15:24.358 --> 15:26.126
and to know what's right.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.128
You know?

15:31.098 --> 15:33.601
But you'll make it through.
I promise.

15:34.502 --> 15:36.970
You believe me?
Yeah.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.473
Okay. Come get some soup.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.443
Okay.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.081
Okay.

16:08.736 --> 16:11.271
<i>Does anyone recognize him?</i>

16:11.305 --> 16:15.209
Daisy. Aren't you gonna
go over and take a look?

16:17.545 --> 16:21.148
-He's yours. You found him.
-No! Don't say that.

16:22.216 --> 16:23.350
I don't want him.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.365
<i>He's dead. Don't touch him.</i>

16:38.398 --> 16:40.067
<i>Settle down.</i>

16:40.100 --> 16:41.736
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>you should do that.</i>

16:41.769 --> 16:44.037
<i>What? You've never seen</i> CSI?

16:44.839 --> 16:46.541
I'm just gonna check for ID.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.444
What are you doing?

16:50.477 --> 16:52.412
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

16:52.446 --> 16:56.416
I'm calling the police
or my mom or both.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.484
Don't.

16:57.519 --> 16:59.286
Why not?

17:00.622 --> 17:01.656
I mean...

17:03.525 --> 17:05.058
...what's the rush?

17:05.092 --> 17:06.528
He's not in any rush.

17:06.561 --> 17:09.429
You're crazy.
Dina's gone crazy.

17:09.864 --> 17:11.365
Seriously.

17:16.270 --> 17:18.338
<i>I wonder if he suffered.</i>

17:18.372 --> 17:20.340
<i>It probably wasn't fun.</i>

17:20.374 --> 17:21.408
Dying.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.748
Lola? What is it?

17:30.484 --> 17:31.553
Suicide.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.088
Well,
maybe he was pushed.

17:36.824 --> 17:39.794
And it was supposed to
look like a suicide.

17:39.827 --> 17:41.763
I don't like this.

17:41.796 --> 17:44.599
It's not funny.
It's not fun.

17:44.632 --> 17:46.366
Nobody's laughing.

17:47.702 --> 17:50.404
You're right.
It's really serious.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.508
Which is exactly why we
have to take this seriously.

17:53.541 --> 17:56.443
Cool. I agree.
That is why I'm gonna call--

17:56.476 --> 17:57.612
- No.
- No.

17:57.645 --> 17:59.714
What then?

17:59.747 --> 18:03.250
I mean, you know our moms.
They'll think we're,
like, traumatized.

18:04.819 --> 18:07.689
First, the cops
will ask us
a million questions.

18:07.722 --> 18:10.490
Then the moms
will ask us
a million questions.

18:13.828 --> 18:16.698
He's somebody's family.

18:17.732 --> 18:20.467
-Exactly.
-I'm not saying we do nothing.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.706
We make a pact
to come back
tomorrow morning.

18:24.739 --> 18:26.874
Do the <i>Law & Order</i> thing.

18:26.908 --> 18:29.176
Try and find out who he was.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.680
If we can't figure it out
by Sunday, we tell our moms.

18:32.714 --> 18:34.247
But not before then.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.551
I'm in, obviously.

18:36.584 --> 18:39.486
Assuming you're all open to
consulting the spirit world.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.154
I'm not into any of it.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.323
Come on.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.194
This is our last weekend
before middle school.

18:47.227 --> 18:50.197
And before you know it,
it'll be Monday,
first period.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.232
She's right.

18:52.265 --> 18:55.435
My mom won't let me watch
all those shows
you're talking about

18:55.469 --> 18:59.574
because she says it's always
about men killing girls
and other men saving girls

18:59.607 --> 19:02.476
or finding the dead girls
they could have saved.

19:04.746 --> 19:05.880
But this is on us.

19:07.582 --> 19:08.750
This is our body.

19:12.854 --> 19:15.255
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

19:15.288 --> 19:19.226
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

19:38.713 --> 19:39.747
Mom!

20:09.443 --> 20:11.612
How long have you been
sitting there for?

20:12.680 --> 20:14.414
Like six hours.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.651
It's creepy.

20:16.684 --> 20:19.954
Um, look,
I have a proposition for you.

20:19.987 --> 20:22.422
I'm not sure how
you're gonna feel about it.

20:22.456 --> 20:23.891
What is it?

20:23.925 --> 20:25.927
- Would you like some
blueberry pancakes?

20:25.960 --> 20:28.529
Meaning would you like for me
to make them for you?

20:28.563 --> 20:30.430
First of all, yes.

20:30.464 --> 20:32.700
Um, second of all,

20:32.734 --> 20:34.936
could I maybe help
make them?

20:34.969 --> 20:36.804
- You?
- Yeah.

20:36.838 --> 20:41.642
-You in the kitchen
assisting me?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Insane.

20:41.676 --> 20:44.277
I mean, I'll take it.
I'm thrilled.
Yeah. Mmm.

20:44.311 --> 20:47.782
Okay, well, then I'm gonna
go start making pancakes
if I may.

20:47.815 --> 20:50.518
Great. Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
All right, goodbye.

20:50.551 --> 20:53.855
Before you go,
I just had to
say some things.

20:53.888 --> 20:55.857
They've been on my mind.

20:55.890 --> 20:58.291
Well, what is it, honey?
Tell me.
Well--

20:58.325 --> 20:59.927
Well, I should start with,

21:01.028 --> 21:02.563
your shoes look really great.

21:03.064 --> 21:04.866
So do your jeans.

21:04.899 --> 21:07.668
Oh, no. Here we go.
Your outfit
is perfectly coordinated.

21:07.702 --> 21:09.704
I am bracing myself
for the worst.
And-- Yeah.

21:09.737 --> 21:12.073
Your hair looks very good.
Natural beauty.

21:12.106 --> 21:13.608
Can I skip mass
this weekend?

21:13.641 --> 21:16.010
Your nails are unchipped...
What? Wait. No.

21:16.043 --> 21:17.645
No. Excuse me.
...and manicured.

21:17.678 --> 21:19.580
Excuse me. Please go back.

21:19.614 --> 21:24.451
I heard something
amidst the compliments
that displeased me much.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.387
Was it something
about mass maybe?

21:27.420 --> 21:31.424
Skip it?
Can I do that? Please?
Oh, my gosh.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.760
Pl-Pl-Please?

21:32.794 --> 21:33.828
Yeah?
Please explain.

21:33.861 --> 21:36.329
So, first of all,
you said,

21:36.363 --> 21:40.101
"Mari, you can have
two skips this summer."

21:40.134 --> 21:43.037
And I've only cashed in on
one of those skips.

21:43.070 --> 21:45.573
Mmm.
So I'm entitled
to a second one.

21:45.606 --> 21:47.508
Actually.
Um, all right.

21:47.542 --> 21:50.678
Well, let's see.
I have put that
before the judge.

21:50.711 --> 21:52.780
Anything else
you'd like to say before--
Yeah. Yes.

21:52.814 --> 21:55.482
And it is my last weekend
with my friends.

21:55.516 --> 21:57.484
My best friends.
With my besties.

21:57.518 --> 22:01.856
Before we are
cruelly separated,
and I go to St. Cecelia's.

22:01.889 --> 22:03.891
It's so sad.
This is heartrending.

22:03.925 --> 22:08.029
And it's the last chance I get
to hang out with them.
So, please?

22:08.062 --> 22:12.465
All right, well, you have
really very well laid out

22:12.499 --> 22:15.570
the trials and tribulations
of Mari.

22:15.603 --> 22:16.637
Yeah, thank you.

22:16.671 --> 22:18.072
And so now please

22:18.105 --> 22:21.474
let me take it
to the higher court

22:21.509 --> 22:24.512
of my mind and emotions
to deliberate.

22:24.545 --> 22:26.547
Mmm. I see.
Okay, I've decided

22:27.982 --> 22:30.718
that I did say
you could skip twice.

22:30.751 --> 22:32.153
Thank you.

22:32.186 --> 22:34.522
And you know what?
You're way too good at this.

22:34.555 --> 22:36.858
You're like a politician.
It's a lot.
I'm trying to deal with it.

22:36.891 --> 22:38.793
-Thank you.
-Okay. Bye.

23:08.055 --> 23:09.123
Mm-mmm.

23:10.024 --> 23:11.058
Oh, my God.

23:15.963 --> 23:16.998
What time is it?

23:17.598 --> 23:19.000
Time to get up.

23:19.033 --> 23:21.035
Okay.
You've got work.

23:22.970 --> 23:25.438
Thank you.
Thank you for this.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.608
Is someone in the shower?

23:27.642 --> 23:31.512
I got the bathroom
steamed up for you.
The way you like it.

23:31.545 --> 23:32.980
You did?

23:33.014 --> 23:36.117
Oh. Thank you. It's Saturday.
I'm your mom.

23:36.150 --> 23:38.185
I feel like
I should be doing
things for you.

23:38.219 --> 23:41.756
That's some other family's
Saturday morning.
I don't mind.

23:42.590 --> 23:43.758
Okay, here we go.

23:46.527 --> 23:47.662
-Hey.
-Yeah.

23:47.695 --> 23:49.630
Can I go hang out
with my friends?

23:50.197 --> 23:53.000
Um, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

24:53.194 --> 24:55.062
How's it coming?

24:55.096 --> 24:59.934
Something about your colors
this morning
just feels really off.

25:00.601 --> 25:02.036
Yeah? Can I see?

25:02.937 --> 25:05.106
If you want to.
Sure.

25:15.883 --> 25:16.951
Oh.

25:21.989 --> 25:23.591
Well, it's not finished.

25:24.825 --> 25:26.060
Sure.

25:27.862 --> 25:31.332
Okay. Do not blame me
if you don't like it.

25:31.365 --> 25:32.967
This is your essence.

25:34.769 --> 25:35.803
Okay, Mom.

25:45.679 --> 25:47.148
Really? It's summer.

25:55.890 --> 25:59.026
You're gonna love
middle school. It's amazing.

25:59.060 --> 26:01.362
Like maybe
the best time
in a kid's life.

26:01.395 --> 26:03.631
-Really?
-God, no.

26:03.664 --> 26:07.201
It's the worst.
Like literally
seventh pit of hell.

26:07.234 --> 26:09.770
Well,
at least there's my friends.

26:09.804 --> 26:13.274
You think that
until they're not.
Just wait and see.

26:13.307 --> 26:16.177
The mean girl thing might not
start for another year, but...

26:16.210 --> 26:18.079
My friends aren't mean.

26:18.112 --> 26:20.881
If you look at
your friend group
and there's no mean girl,

26:20.915 --> 26:23.284
well,
mean girl is probably you.

26:24.685 --> 26:26.287
You'll see.
Everything changes.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.623
And I'm not just talking about
training bras and body hair.

26:29.657 --> 26:32.793
I got to go.
Burgers don't grill
themselves.

26:37.398 --> 26:41.102
Your dad set up
a super fun rocket launcher
in the backyard.

26:41.135 --> 26:43.671
Um, maybe for a little bit.

26:43.704 --> 26:46.140
We're about two minutes
from the lift off.

26:46.173 --> 26:49.777
Okay, okay. But after that,
I've got plans, so...

26:49.810 --> 26:53.614
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, yeah, totally.

26:54.281 --> 26:55.950
Did you do your math facts?

26:55.983 --> 26:58.385
-No media before math facts.
-I did my math facts, Mom.

26:58.419 --> 27:01.422
And have you finished
<i>Tuck Everlasting</i> yet?

27:01.455 --> 27:05.059
You had a goal of 30 books,
and last I checked,
you were at 29.

27:05.092 --> 27:08.796
Almost. I just don't want to
get to the sad part,
that's all.

27:08.829 --> 27:10.431
Well, how'd you know
about the sad part?

27:10.464 --> 27:12.766
Because I have
a stupid sister.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.335
I'm right here.

27:16.770 --> 27:19.673
Well, sometimes the sad parts
make the happy parts
matter more.

27:24.111 --> 27:26.147
Let me know if you're gonna
spend the night.

27:26.180 --> 27:30.084
Okay. I think that's the plan.
Probably at Dina
or Lola's house.

27:30.117 --> 27:32.153
Okay, but just remember
I have a double shift,

27:32.186 --> 27:34.922
so I'm gonna be super late,
so I need you
to message me or something

27:34.955 --> 27:37.258
and let me know
where you're gonna be.
I will.

27:38.926 --> 27:40.227
Ugh.

27:40.261 --> 27:43.063
Okay. Have a nice day.

27:43.097 --> 27:45.266
You too, Mom. Be safe.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.769
Do you want a ride?

27:48.802 --> 27:51.172
Uh, no, I'm fine.

27:51.205 --> 27:52.239
Okay, you sure?

27:53.340 --> 27:54.375
Okay.

27:56.010 --> 27:57.411
Good, 'cause I'm so late.

28:07.522 --> 28:08.856
100 feet.

28:10.057 --> 28:11.792
What?

28:11.825 --> 28:14.929
I did some research.
That's how high
the bridge is.

28:16.297 --> 28:17.998
That's high.

28:18.032 --> 28:20.935
My brother says there's
nothing more satisfying

28:20.968 --> 28:22.870
than peeing
off something high.

28:22.903 --> 28:25.039
But I guess we'll never know.

28:36.518 --> 28:40.454
A lot of people
killed themselves here.
I read it on Wikipedia.

28:40.487 --> 28:43.090
During the Great Depression
when everybody got poor.

28:44.091 --> 28:48.395
Do you think
he was poor?
The man.

28:49.496 --> 28:51.198
He was wearing a suit.

28:51.232 --> 28:55.102
I saw a suit
at Goodwill
that cost $5.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.976
They say the nickname
is Suicide Bridge.

29:03.877 --> 29:05.513
How is that possible?

29:05.547 --> 29:08.516
What do you mean?
It's not like
it's hard to jump.

29:08.550 --> 29:12.019
Like, I mean,
it's right in the middle
of where we live.

29:12.052 --> 29:14.421
How did we
not know about it?

29:14.455 --> 29:16.857
There's probably
a lot of things
we don't know.

29:17.858 --> 29:20.194
This bridge
is for sure haunted.

29:22.329 --> 29:24.465
Wait, when you were
researching the bridge,

29:24.498 --> 29:27.301
what were you using
to look up all this stuff?

29:28.235 --> 29:29.303
The family laptop.

29:31.105 --> 29:32.473
What?

29:32.507 --> 29:34.842
Your mom
is a total psycho
helicopter parent.

29:34.875 --> 29:37.044
She's gonna see
your browsing history stuff
about suicide

29:37.077 --> 29:38.479
and get all freaked.

29:38.513 --> 29:40.247
Oh, crap!

29:40.281 --> 29:41.949
Remember you got
that scratch
on your arm

29:41.982 --> 29:43.851
and she was convinced
you were cutting yourself?

29:43.884 --> 29:45.853
She's probably
already called
your therapist.

29:45.886 --> 29:48.222
Oh, crap! Crap! Crap!

29:49.857 --> 29:52.960
I-- Maybe she won't
see it until later.

29:53.427 --> 29:55.462
You know, after.

29:56.497 --> 29:58.265
We need to move him.

29:59.099 --> 30:01.135
What? Why?

30:01.168 --> 30:04.938
For the same reason that Dina
shouldn't have used
the family laptop.

30:04.972 --> 30:09.511
Somebody's going to see
before we can do
what we need to do.

30:22.423 --> 30:24.058
What's your problem?

30:24.091 --> 30:25.426
There was a fly eating him,

30:25.459 --> 30:28.162
and then I was afraid
that it might eat me.

30:29.363 --> 30:31.432
Do we have
to worry
about germs?

30:31.465 --> 30:33.635
Well, you know,
on this one crime show,

30:33.668 --> 30:35.869
a woman made out
with a guy at a bar.

30:35.903 --> 30:38.540
He pressured her to
go home with him.
She said no.

30:38.573 --> 30:40.140
Then, like,
two days later,

30:40.174 --> 30:42.544
she developed
this weird sore
in her mouth.

30:42.577 --> 30:46.447
So she went to go get it
checked out, and the doctor
called the police

30:46.480 --> 30:49.651
because the tests had shown
that she'd eaten
human remains.

30:49.684 --> 30:51.952
I know.

30:51.985 --> 30:56.223
So of course they track
the guy down, and he had
a basement full of bodies.

30:57.625 --> 30:59.293
She would have been next.

31:00.662 --> 31:04.632
So yeah,
germs,
definitely a concern.

31:09.571 --> 31:12.339
My mom uses them
whenever she chops jalapeños.

31:15.042 --> 31:17.144
This feels wrong.

31:20.715 --> 31:23.050
Who ripped one?
Was that you, Mari?

31:23.083 --> 31:26.186
- No, it was not me.
- I think it was him.

31:26.220 --> 31:27.287
Ew.

31:27.321 --> 31:29.123
That is so nasty.

31:30.257 --> 31:31.492
It's death gas.

31:34.228 --> 31:36.997
Well, come on.
Let's hurry up.

32:00.454 --> 32:02.022
I think Daisy was right.

32:02.690 --> 32:04.191
About what?

32:04.224 --> 32:06.994
I think he was poor.
Maybe even homeless.

32:08.462 --> 32:09.463
What is it?

32:10.097 --> 32:11.165
It's his wallet.

32:20.575 --> 32:22.242
What's that?
A restaurant?

32:24.311 --> 32:25.647
A bar.

32:25.680 --> 32:26.714
How do you know?

32:27.782 --> 32:29.016
I know.

32:31.084 --> 32:33.153
So we should go?

32:34.722 --> 32:36.490
To a bar?

32:36.524 --> 32:39.092
That's what they do
on those cop shows.

32:40.427 --> 32:44.364
I mean,
I guess I can map it.

32:45.098 --> 32:47.000
See how far away it is.

32:47.034 --> 32:48.770
Take a picture of him first.

32:48.803 --> 32:51.171
A picture? That's just wrong.

32:52.072 --> 32:54.041
He's not him anymore.

32:54.074 --> 32:57.478
Think of it as, like,
taking a photo of a pot
without a plant in it.

32:57.512 --> 32:59.514
Yeah, she's right.

32:59.547 --> 33:02.316
We do need a photo of him
if we're ever gonna
find out who he is.

33:02.349 --> 33:04.686
Unless you want to
carry him around
in your backpack.

33:06.754 --> 33:08.455
Fine. Pick him up.

33:12.493 --> 33:17.130
And use a filter so he
won't look quite so dead.

33:51.699 --> 33:53.735
Do you think
he was a good person?

33:54.836 --> 33:55.670
What?

33:57.639 --> 33:59.774
I said, do you think
he was a good person?

34:00.407 --> 34:01.509
Oh, um...

34:03.878 --> 34:06.213
Does it matter?

34:06.246 --> 34:10.685
I mean, if he killed himself,
it might have been
because he did something bad.

34:10.718 --> 34:13.320
What if we're wasting
all of our time for nothing?

34:13.353 --> 34:14.789
No. I don't think so.

34:16.490 --> 34:17.792
He was a good guy.

34:18.860 --> 34:20.294
How do you know?

34:20.327 --> 34:22.597
Because most people are good.

34:24.298 --> 34:29.403
Have you ever actually
met a person
who's really truly bad?

34:32.740 --> 34:34.107
I guess not.

34:35.643 --> 34:37.311
Bad people are just on TV.

34:40.247 --> 34:41.583
Right?

34:54.529 --> 34:57.599
What are we even doing?
They're just gonna kick us out.

34:57.632 --> 34:59.667
Come on.
They'll think we're cute.

35:16.618 --> 35:18.820
Um...

35:18.853 --> 35:20.855
Hi, um--
Oh, please don't tell me

35:20.888 --> 35:22.824
one of you are here
looking for your father.

35:22.857 --> 35:25.927
That always breaks her heart.
Always breaks my heart.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.930
No. We are here--

35:28.963 --> 35:32.700
We're ghost hunters,
and we hear that
this place is haunted.

35:32.734 --> 35:36.470
Well,
we've got a lot of spirits.

35:36.504 --> 35:38.238
Spirits.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.275
- They didn't get it.
- I got it.

35:42.309 --> 35:44.512
And I appreciate
the double entendre.

35:44.545 --> 35:46.948
Look, ladies, if you're just
knocking on doors for a goof,

35:46.981 --> 35:48.516
this isn't the place for you.

35:48.549 --> 35:51.619
We're not.
We're in the right place.

35:51.653 --> 35:54.221
-Don't I know you?
-Show her the picture.

35:54.254 --> 35:55.657
I swear I have seen you...

35:55.690 --> 35:56.891
Show her.
...somewhere before.

35:56.924 --> 35:58.425
Um, here.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.799
Okay.
What am I looking at here?

36:06.734 --> 36:08.636
Is that the ghost
you're looking for?

36:08.670 --> 36:12.205
That's not a ghost.
That's a man.
Is he asleep?

36:12.239 --> 36:14.776
He's dead
because he's a ghost.

36:14.809 --> 36:16.944
Is he dead or is he asleep?

36:16.978 --> 36:18.613
He is asleep.
He-- He-- Asleep.

36:18.646 --> 36:20.648
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

36:20.682 --> 36:24.217
You know what?
I do think I know this guy.

36:24.251 --> 36:25.987
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:26.020 --> 36:29.356
He used to sit
at the end of the bar
down there.

36:29.389 --> 36:31.391
An occasional day drinker.

36:31.425 --> 36:35.328
He wasn't a regular,
but he came in enough
that he looks familiar.

36:35.362 --> 36:39.232
He drank bottom-shelf whiskey.
Didn't really talk to anyone.

36:39.266 --> 36:41.002
He did mention
his name once, though.

36:41.035 --> 36:42.603
- Bob. Frank.
- Um...

36:42.637 --> 36:45.338
- Joe. Bob.
- You already said Bob.

36:45.372 --> 36:46.708
- Ed.
- Would you stop?

36:46.741 --> 36:48.943
You're just shouting out
random names now.

36:50.812 --> 36:52.379
Mahone.

36:52.412 --> 36:54.448
I don't know if it was
his first or his last.

36:54.481 --> 36:56.718
I mean,
probably his last name,
right?

36:56.751 --> 36:57.852
- Probably.
- Yeah.

36:57.885 --> 36:59.020
Yeah.
Yeah.

36:59.053 --> 37:00.655
Greg Mahone. Bob Mahone.

37:00.688 --> 37:02.990
Would you stop with the Bobs?

37:03.024 --> 37:04.759
Do you remember anything else?

37:05.392 --> 37:06.627
Um...

37:06.661 --> 37:08.863
Oh,
he played video games.

37:08.896 --> 37:12.399
- Like a-- a Switch or...
- A what?

37:13.735 --> 37:15.903
A Switch.

37:16.571 --> 37:17.739
No.

37:22.777 --> 37:26.914
Oh. Oh, yeah. Okay.
My mom used to play that
when she was a kid, I think.

37:26.948 --> 37:30.585
I don't think my mom
ever played video games.

37:30.618 --> 37:32.854
My mom won't let me
play video games.

37:32.887 --> 37:36.557
My mom only lets me
download games
that are educational.

37:39.459 --> 37:41.696
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

37:41.729 --> 37:44.031
- You have to get it three times.
-  -Go!

37:46.333 --> 37:49.436
How are you doing that?
- I don't even really know.

37:49.469 --> 37:52.006
My strategy is just to push
the buttons fast.

37:54.041 --> 37:56.878
- Watch out!
Watch out!
- No. No. No.

37:58.713 --> 37:59.847
That's unfortunate.

38:00.782 --> 38:02.282
Wait. Look.

38:04.919 --> 38:08.656
Hey, um, you said his name
might have been Mahone?

38:08.689 --> 38:10.958
- Yeah.
- Come look at this.

38:13.094 --> 38:16.329
Now I remember you.
How's your mom?

38:16.363 --> 38:17.397
Fine.

38:17.430 --> 38:20.067
Um, uh, Mahone. See?

38:20.101 --> 38:23.403
Oh, well, look there.
His last name is Mahone.

38:23.436 --> 38:25.039
What do you think
the H stands for?

38:25.072 --> 38:26.707
Henry.

38:26.741 --> 38:29.309
Holden.
Do people still
name their kids Holden?

38:30.545 --> 38:32.680
Um, Harry?

38:33.514 --> 38:34.816
Hector.

38:34.849 --> 38:36.617
Harold?
Bob!

38:36.651 --> 38:38.385
Hey! What did I tell you?

38:39.987 --> 38:41.022
Howard.

38:43.558 --> 38:44.859
His name was Howard.

38:46.060 --> 38:47.094
Like I said.

38:53.768 --> 38:56.637
Now that we know his name,
we have to do more research.

38:56.671 --> 39:00.775
Yeah, but I don't understand
why we need to go
to the school.

39:00.808 --> 39:04.579
Because everything I do
on my phone,
my mom knows about.

39:04.612 --> 39:06.080
She has the stalking app.

39:07.181 --> 39:09.984
See? My mom's not
the only one who's crazy.

39:10.017 --> 39:13.154
She pretends like
she doesn't look at it,
but she does.

39:13.187 --> 39:15.923
Constantly.
She knows everything.

39:15.957 --> 39:18.458
I can tell by the way
she brings stuff up.

39:18.491 --> 39:22.495
Asking if I need new socks
if I've been looking at
goofy cat socks on Pinterest,

39:22.530 --> 39:24.565
that sort of thing.

39:24.599 --> 39:27.668
Then why can't we just
go to the library?
They have computers there.

39:27.702 --> 39:30.838
Because one of the librarians
there is a family friend.

39:30.872 --> 39:32.707
She goes to our church.

39:32.740 --> 39:35.176
She knows I'm only allowed
in the middle grade section.

39:35.209 --> 39:37.477
The computers
are in the adult section.

39:37.511 --> 39:40.615
She'll notice,
and she's super nosy.

39:43.885 --> 39:45.485
Oh, no.

39:45.519 --> 39:47.121
Oh, God.

39:47.154 --> 39:49.790
-What?
-It's her. It's Mom.

39:49.824 --> 39:51.559
Do you think she knows?
She probably knows.

39:51.592 --> 39:52.860
Just, um--

39:52.894 --> 39:55.830
-Just answer it and find out.
-Okay. Shh.

39:58.699 --> 40:01.736
-Mom. Uh, hi.
<i>-Hi. What are you doing?</i>

40:02.536 --> 40:04.906
Yeah, I'm at Dina's house.

40:05.740 --> 40:07.041
My house?

40:07.074 --> 40:09.844
Um, yeah.
We're just reading and stuff.

40:09.877 --> 40:11.913
Don't say reading.
We'd never hang out
and read!

40:11.946 --> 40:13.681
Shut up.

40:13.714 --> 40:15.850
Um, yeah.

40:15.883 --> 40:19.987
We were probably gonna go on
TikTok or watch a movie later,
if that's okay.

40:26.594 --> 40:30.097
What was-- What?
I don't hear anything.

40:30.831 --> 40:32.566
Daisy, move.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.501
- Daisy, move it.
- Daisy.

40:34.535 --> 40:37.705
Oh, yeah,
I hear it now.

40:37.738 --> 40:41.008
- That's--
No, no, that's just the TV.

40:48.916 --> 40:52.687
Oh, I have to go now.
Talk to you later. Bye.

40:53.854 --> 40:55.957
Daisy, what were you thinking?

40:55.990 --> 40:58.793
We're reading at my house?
Seriously?

40:58.826 --> 41:01.595
I know.
It was dumb.
It was dumb, all right.

41:01.629 --> 41:03.463
I don't know why I said that.

41:04.598 --> 41:06.499
Are you okay?

41:06.534 --> 41:09.236
I mean, now she's definitely
going to check
the stalking app.

41:09.270 --> 41:11.105
She's gonna see
I'm not there and--

41:12.840 --> 41:14.608
- Um, what do I do?
- Um...

41:14.642 --> 41:16.744
What do I do?
Do I answer or-- I mean--

41:16.777 --> 41:17.878
Don't answer it.

41:28.756 --> 41:31.025
I can't believe
you just did that.

41:31.058 --> 41:35.529
That was--
That was my Christmas present.
My only Christmas present.

41:35.563 --> 41:36.797
We can get it fixed.

41:47.875 --> 41:50.711
I just saved you.
That's what I did.

41:50.745 --> 41:54.548
Dina, you didn't save me.
You have screwed me.

41:55.116 --> 41:56.684
No.

41:56.717 --> 41:58.786
You know, in some cultures,
if you save someone,

41:58.819 --> 42:01.756
you're responsible
for their life forever.

42:01.789 --> 42:04.225
- Is that actually true?
- Oh, it definitely is.

42:04.258 --> 42:06.260
Really?
Because sometimes
you say weird things,

42:06.293 --> 42:10.331
and they sound just, you know,
a little bit made up.
Just a little bit.

42:10.364 --> 42:13.000
Your family believes in facts.
My family believes in truths.

42:13.034 --> 42:14.201
There you go again.

42:16.937 --> 42:19.840
You heard her, right?
You're my responsibility.

42:19.874 --> 42:23.944
My phone. I mean,
that was, like, my life.

42:23.978 --> 42:26.213
How am I gonna
call my mom back?

42:26.247 --> 42:27.748
I mean, you already lied.

42:27.782 --> 42:30.985
Just... lie again.

42:31.018 --> 42:35.689
Say some, like,
guy stole it or something.

42:35.723 --> 42:37.658
I don't know.

42:44.098 --> 42:45.666
At least you had one.

42:59.647 --> 43:02.950
<i>Hi, this is Mari.</i>
<i>Leave a message. Laters.</i>

43:02.983 --> 43:05.052
Hi, Mari.

43:05.086 --> 43:09.657
Um, listen, I don't understand
why you're not answering.

43:09.690 --> 43:13.127
I know you're not at Dina's.
I know you lied to me.

43:13.160 --> 43:18.265
I'm very confused,
and I'm upset,
and I'm worried. Okay?

43:18.299 --> 43:22.002
And I really need you
to call me. All right?

43:22.036 --> 43:24.004
I'm trying to
keep my shit together.

43:24.038 --> 43:27.875
You can get mad at me
about that later.
But I'm trying.

43:27.908 --> 43:32.780
Um, I don't even really know
what to say.
Just please call me back.

43:32.813 --> 43:33.848
Thank you.

43:45.259 --> 43:48.729
<i>Hi, this is Mari.</i>
<i>Leave a message. Laters.</i>

44:06.347 --> 44:07.915
Hello?

44:07.948 --> 44:09.383
<i>Hi. Yeah. It's Stacie.</i>

44:09.416 --> 44:10.851
<i>I was just wondering...</i>

44:20.327 --> 44:21.328
Hello?

44:22.196 --> 44:23.731
<i>This is Stacie.</i>

44:23.764 --> 44:25.366
Hi. Yeah.

44:27.067 --> 44:30.137
Here's your license
and registration.
Here's the bad news.

44:30.171 --> 44:32.806
Try to be a little more
careful next time, okay?

44:38.112 --> 44:39.480
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

44:39.514 --> 44:42.049
<i>This is Stacie, Mari's mom.</i>

44:45.219 --> 44:48.322
It looks small.
How does it
suddenly look small?

44:50.324 --> 44:53.327
It's bigger on the inside
than it is on the outside.

44:55.095 --> 44:58.432
The window
in Mrs. Garcia's room
doesn't lock.

44:58.465 --> 45:02.203
Brent Schoonover broke it
two years ago.
We can crawl in there.

45:02.236 --> 45:05.239
Is this stupid?
Maybe this is stupid.

45:05.272 --> 45:08.809
I mean, it seemed fun at first,
but now my phone is ruined,

45:08.842 --> 45:10.344
my mom knows I'm lying,

45:10.377 --> 45:12.346
and we're thinking about
breaking into a building.

45:12.379 --> 45:13.948
We're not breaking
into anything.

45:13.981 --> 45:15.883
Brent Schoonover is the one
who broke something.

45:15.916 --> 45:18.152
I guarantee you we're in
serious trouble by now.

45:18.185 --> 45:20.020
Then what's the point
in stopping now?

45:20.054 --> 45:21.989
It's called
asking for forgiveness.

45:22.022 --> 45:25.893
Jesus.
Seriously. I'm being serious.

45:25.926 --> 45:28.796
I mean,
we say we're sorry,
and we end this now.

45:30.197 --> 45:31.232
No.

45:31.999 --> 45:34.301
After my dad disappeared,

45:34.335 --> 45:37.404
that's when my mom
just checked out.

45:39.073 --> 45:40.941
She never tried
looking for him.

45:40.975 --> 45:43.944
She never seemed to worry
something might have
happened to him.

45:43.978 --> 45:47.114
Well, what if
she knew something?
What do you mean?

45:47.147 --> 45:50.217
What if she didn't look
for him because she knew
something about why he left?

45:50.251 --> 45:51.285
He didn't leave.

45:53.020 --> 45:55.055
You don't leave
and not say goodbye.

45:55.089 --> 45:58.292
Well, sometimes adults
know things
but don't tell us.

45:58.325 --> 46:01.095
You can't not look for someone
who's gone.

46:01.128 --> 46:04.298
Someone is waiting
for this guy to come home.

46:04.331 --> 46:07.201
So, no,
I don't think this is stupid.

46:09.103 --> 46:10.538
And I don't want to stop.

47:17.237 --> 47:18.272
What?

47:50.270 --> 47:53.140
The first thing we need to do
is download a TOR browser.

47:54.341 --> 47:56.343
What's that?

47:56.377 --> 47:59.313
It's a browser that allows us
to surf anonymously
on the dark web.

47:59.346 --> 48:00.981
The what?

48:01.014 --> 48:03.450
It's basically like
the dungeon of the Internet.

48:03.484 --> 48:05.452
Why don't you
just use Google?

48:05.486 --> 48:07.488
Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna do that too.

48:07.522 --> 48:12.092
But the data mining
goes deeper and wider
in search engines like Pipl.

48:12.126 --> 48:13.661
You sound like
you're just making stuff up,

48:13.695 --> 48:15.429
like you're auditioning
for <i>C</i> or something.

48:15.462 --> 48:18.465
We are so using Google.

48:18.499 --> 48:21.536
We should also do a séance.

48:25.573 --> 48:27.709
Guys, I'm serious.

48:27.742 --> 48:30.512
There's more to this world
than just what you can find
in a search engine.

48:32.747 --> 48:36.350
Okay, well, while you're
figuring out all this
nerd stuff, I have to pee.

49:26.300 --> 49:30.137
Um, get me a pen.
I think I got what we need.

50:09.376 --> 50:11.445
We need to
get out of here now.

50:21.154 --> 50:23.257
Hey, why are you
weirdos running?

50:26.159 --> 50:27.294
You wouldn't
believe me.

50:28.530 --> 50:29.564
Try me.

50:32.499 --> 50:35.135
What do you think?

50:35.168 --> 50:38.840
I think that is
a very interesting story.

50:38.873 --> 50:41.408
And also, you--
Oh, my God.

50:41.441 --> 50:44.211
Ow!
I got a brain freeze.

50:44.244 --> 50:46.748
Sugar is like cocaine
for 11-year-olds.

50:46.781 --> 50:48.683
You all out of your minds.

50:48.716 --> 50:50.852
You don't even
believe us, do you?

50:50.885 --> 50:54.589
I know that whatever
rainbow unicorn Narnia
kids' stuff you're chasing

50:54.622 --> 50:57.592
seems important, but it's not.

50:57.625 --> 51:01.328
I thought your sister was cool
for giving us free food,

51:02.129 --> 51:04.364
but she actually sucks.

51:04.398 --> 51:07.802
She thinks she's a grown-up
or something.

51:07.835 --> 51:12.339
I mean, this isn't just us
playing pretend. This is real.

51:13.140 --> 51:15.577
Yeah, um, do you want to see?

51:15.610 --> 51:17.612
'Cause seriously,
we have photos
if you don't believe us.

51:17.645 --> 51:19.781
Carol!
Yes, Mr. Peterson?

51:19.814 --> 51:21.716
Can you help
with the computer?

51:21.749 --> 51:25.152
It keeps freezing
when I try to save
this accounting spreadsheet.

51:25.620 --> 51:27.487
Boomer problems.

51:27.522 --> 51:31.191
One second.

51:31.224 --> 51:34.729
You're all gonna look back
on this moment and realize
just how dumb you were.

51:34.762 --> 51:37.565
But it doesn't mean
you shouldn't have fun.

51:37.599 --> 51:39.132
Bye, girls.

51:45.439 --> 51:47.675
I hate teenagers.

51:48.876 --> 51:50.778
I think, like, Old Town,
start there.

51:50.812 --> 51:54.214
And then just some...
...spotlights
for the alleyways.

51:54.247 --> 51:57.184
Memorial Park, Central Park.
Get some guys
on the ground there.

51:57.217 --> 51:58.853
A bar?

51:58.886 --> 52:01.823
I mean, what were they
possibly doing at a bar?

52:01.856 --> 52:03.256
Tequila shooters?

52:03.658 --> 52:05.292
No.

52:05.325 --> 52:07.862
I mean, I'm joking,
but now that I think of it,

52:07.895 --> 52:10.430
I remember sneaking
some whiskey
from my dad's stash

52:10.464 --> 52:11.866
at a sleepover
in the fifth grade.

52:11.899 --> 52:13.868
I mean,
I know what you're saying,

52:13.901 --> 52:17.170
but Mari just
would not do that.
I know her.

52:17.204 --> 52:19.907
Well, I didn't think
my daughter was secretly
watching all the murder shows

52:19.941 --> 52:22.309
I can't seem
to get enough off.

52:22.342 --> 52:24.277
So I guess
we were all
a little clueless.

52:24.311 --> 52:26.346
Yeah, but...
...Mari's kind of a prude.

52:26.380 --> 52:29.851
Like, she gets mad at me
when I swear.

52:29.884 --> 52:32.687
She walks out of the bathroom
when I pee in front of her.

52:33.655 --> 52:35.255
You pee in front of her?

52:35.288 --> 52:37.692
Well, not like every day,
but...

52:37.725 --> 52:39.661
Okay.
Yeah, that's what I figured.

52:39.694 --> 52:40.895
You know, it's happened.

52:42.396 --> 52:43.865
Lola and I sauna together.

52:48.268 --> 52:52.907
Or it has something to do
with a boy, right?

52:52.940 --> 52:54.676
Has to be a boy.

52:54.709 --> 52:57.612
I mean, that's reductive
and would be disappointing,

52:57.645 --> 52:59.747
but yeah,
it's plausible.

52:59.781 --> 53:01.448
Yeah, just let us know.

53:01.481 --> 53:03.818
Yeah.
We'll be standing by.
Thank you, Frank.

53:03.851 --> 53:04.886
All right. Bye.

53:07.989 --> 53:10.525
Laura.
No, I'm actually good,
thank you.

53:10.558 --> 53:11.826
I'm good.

53:11.859 --> 53:12.960
Um...

53:14.428 --> 53:16.698
- What's going on
with our girls?

53:16.731 --> 53:20.434
I wish I-- I wish
I had an answer for you.

53:20.467 --> 53:22.603
Did Daisy
say something
to you?

53:22.637 --> 53:26.674
Has she done
anything off lately
that might clue you in?

53:28.442 --> 53:29.877
What are you thinking?

53:36.551 --> 53:39.821
I'm thinking I haven't really
paid attention to my daughter

53:39.854 --> 53:40.888
in, like, a year.

53:43.991 --> 53:46.393
Like really paid attention,
you know?

53:48.462 --> 53:50.363
So I couldn't even
answer that.

53:52.800 --> 53:55.036
This place is
totally sketchy.

53:55.069 --> 53:57.972
Yeah,
I don't really feel like
being mauled by a guard dog.

53:58.005 --> 54:00.407
- A séance
would be way easier.

54:00.440 --> 54:04.011
Okay,
if this is a bust, we'll do
your stupid séance thing.

54:04.045 --> 54:05.880
What do you think
he keeps in there?

54:05.913 --> 54:08.549
Probably bodies
hanging from hooks.

54:08.583 --> 54:09.984
Stop.

54:10.017 --> 54:11.953
What if it's treasure?

54:11.986 --> 54:16.289
Imagine, like, piles and piles
of gold coins
and jewels and stuff.

54:16.323 --> 54:17.792
So cool.

54:17.825 --> 54:20.393
When my great-grandma
went to the nursing home,

54:20.427 --> 54:24.832
she had one of these,
but it was just filled
with dusty old antiques.

54:28.803 --> 54:31.839
Did you hear that?
I told you there'd be a dog.

54:31.873 --> 54:34.307
I don't--
I don't think it's--
Can we hurry please?

54:34.341 --> 54:35.643
Yeah, yeah, we're close.

54:35.676 --> 54:38.813
Um, six, seven. Got it.

54:49.489 --> 54:51.391
Are you kidding me?

54:51.424 --> 54:54.629
I knew this was bad.
I really think we should go home now.

54:54.662 --> 54:56.063
No!

54:56.097 --> 54:59.600
No? I mean,
what other option
do we have?

55:02.770 --> 55:05.072
Do you have
a toothpick or something?

55:05.106 --> 55:06.574
Holy shit!

55:09.442 --> 55:10.878
I'm leaving.

55:10.912 --> 55:13.881
Whoa, whoa.
Daisy. Daisy!
Daisy! Daisy!

55:13.915 --> 55:16.651
What are you gonna do?
Shoot the ghost?

55:16.684 --> 55:18.351
You can't shoot a ghost.

55:18.385 --> 55:21.421
Really? Of course
you can't shoot a ghost.

55:21.454 --> 55:24.525
You know,
I can never tell if
you're joking or just crazy.

55:24.559 --> 55:26.493
Don't call me crazy.
That's patriarchal bull!

55:28.129 --> 55:29.931
Oh, my God.

55:33.601 --> 55:34.735
Wait. Wait.

55:37.171 --> 55:41.809
Move closer and, um, wait
for the lightning next time.

55:55.923 --> 55:56.991
Now!

56:06.701 --> 56:10.771
That was so badass.

56:12.874 --> 56:14.441
That was so cool.

56:15.176 --> 56:16.611
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

56:24.652 --> 56:26.087
Two, three...

57:13.167 --> 57:14.769
I think he had a family.

57:20.741 --> 57:21.776
I don't get it.

57:22.710 --> 57:24.578
He lived here?

57:24.612 --> 57:26.948
Well, it was 99 bucks a month.

57:36.857 --> 57:38.826
I'm three months older than you.

57:39.894 --> 57:41.228
What?

57:41.262 --> 57:43.764
You remember when
that used to be a big deal,

57:43.798 --> 57:46.233
the fact that I was
three months older than you?

57:46.267 --> 57:47.601
Yeah.

57:47.635 --> 57:49.737
It used to be better
to be older,

57:51.005 --> 57:53.641
but now it doesn't seem
all that great.

57:53.674 --> 57:57.511
Adults are always asking me
what I want to be
when I grow up.

57:57.545 --> 57:58.579
Yeah?

57:59.680 --> 58:01.949
They always seem to really care.

58:01.983 --> 58:04.819
Well,
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

58:05.853 --> 58:06.954
A UPS driver.

58:06.988 --> 58:08.956
What? Seriously?

58:08.990 --> 58:12.693
You sound like a grown-up.
That's what they always
say to me too.

58:12.727 --> 58:14.261
But hold on.

58:14.295 --> 58:17.665
Are you telling me,
out of all the jobs
in the world--

58:17.698 --> 58:21.068
I mean,
movie star,
soccer player,

58:21.102 --> 58:24.972
president, whatever--
you want to be a UPS driver?

58:27.241 --> 58:29.577
Why do you want to be
a UPS driver?

58:29.610 --> 58:31.679
You bring people
packages all day.

58:31.712 --> 58:34.715
It's like being Santa.

58:34.749 --> 58:37.018
Yeah, Santa
in gross brown shorts.

58:37.051 --> 58:40.187
But what about a rock star

58:40.221 --> 58:43.090
or a YouTuber or,

58:44.191 --> 58:45.726
I don't know, a veterinarian?

58:45.760 --> 58:48.696
That's the kind of stuff
we used to say.

58:48.729 --> 58:51.032
Feels like
we're past that phase now.

58:51.065 --> 58:53.034
Phase? What phase?

58:53.067 --> 58:55.569
I'm trying to be realistic.

58:56.971 --> 58:58.973
In case you haven't noticed,

59:00.274 --> 59:02.977
growing up isn't great.

59:10.885 --> 59:11.919
It's time.

59:18.959 --> 59:20.761
Why Daisy's house?

59:20.795 --> 59:22.296
To talk to the spirits,

59:22.329 --> 59:25.332
we need to go to
an in-between place.
A broken place.

59:25.366 --> 59:28.335
Then it's easier
to hear through
to the other side.

59:29.203 --> 59:31.172
Then this is the place.

59:49.890 --> 59:52.660
It's supposed to be
a perimeter of salt,

59:52.693 --> 59:55.062
but I think sugar
will work just as well.

59:55.096 --> 59:56.931
I'm trying to figure out
the science behind this

59:56.964 --> 1:00:00.067
because salt is made of sodium
and chloride,

1:00:00.101 --> 1:00:02.803
and it's ionically bonded,
whereas sugar
on the other hand--

1:00:02.837 --> 1:00:04.038
Shh!
Ow!

1:00:06.307 --> 1:00:11.178
Nobody is allowed to leave
the sacred circle
until we are finished.

1:00:11.212 --> 1:00:13.781
No matter what happens.

1:00:14.415 --> 1:00:15.883
Do you understand?

1:00:18.919 --> 1:00:22.356
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll follow the hocus-pocus rule book.

1:00:23.924 --> 1:00:26.861
I'm not gonna leave.
I mean, we're in this together.

1:00:29.964 --> 1:00:33.400
We each have to pay death
for him to take us
to the other side.

1:00:33.434 --> 1:00:36.003
Pay?
Yeah, seriously,
come on, Lola.

1:00:36.036 --> 1:00:37.404
Ow.

1:00:37.438 --> 1:00:41.041
You have <i>CSI,</i>
I have <i>Ghost Hunters.</i>

1:00:41.075 --> 1:00:44.378
I know how this works.
You choose what you pay.

1:01:40.167 --> 1:01:41.402
Now what?

1:01:41.435 --> 1:01:44.838
Now we invite him to join us.

1:01:45.873 --> 1:01:47.107
How do we--
Mahone.

1:01:48.242 --> 1:01:49.710
Howard Mahone.

1:01:51.278 --> 1:01:52.479
Do you hear us?

1:01:54.516 --> 1:01:57.151
If you hear us, give us a sign.

1:02:09.797 --> 1:02:11.899
Maybe we should all
close our eyes

1:02:13.133 --> 1:02:16.303
so we can concentrate better.

1:02:20.474 --> 1:02:22.309
So we can all be in harmony.

1:03:34.481 --> 1:03:36.283
We found you for a reason.

1:03:37.951 --> 1:03:40.354
Help us understand why.

1:03:44.291 --> 1:03:45.326
He's listening.

1:03:47.995 --> 1:03:49.129
Ask him something.

1:03:52.066 --> 1:03:53.100
Mari?

1:03:54.201 --> 1:03:56.136
W-What am I supposed to ask?

1:03:58.540 --> 1:03:59.574
Anything.

1:04:01.676 --> 1:04:03.545
Okay, um...

1:04:04.978 --> 1:04:08.282
Is there
something else out there?

1:04:11.418 --> 1:04:12.520
Something better?

1:04:14.556 --> 1:04:18.225
I guess I'm asking what's next?

1:04:21.462 --> 1:04:22.496
Dina.

1:04:24.164 --> 1:04:26.300
I don't have any questions.

1:04:26.333 --> 1:04:29.537
Dina!
Seriously, I can't think of anything.

1:04:29.571 --> 1:04:32.172
Dina!
Fine. Fine. Um...

1:04:33.374 --> 1:04:36.977
I don't know. How does this--
How does this even work?

1:04:37.010 --> 1:04:41.181
I mean, I was gonna ask,
"Will I ever fall in love?"

1:04:41.215 --> 1:04:43.484
But... ...that's dumb.

1:04:44.084 --> 1:04:47.321
So, I guess,

1:04:48.723 --> 1:04:51.593
will my parents ever stop
bugging me constantly?

1:04:55.462 --> 1:04:56.497
Daisy.

1:05:03.237 --> 1:05:04.972
Can you bring my dad back?

1:05:06.173 --> 1:05:08.375
And if not,

1:05:10.144 --> 1:05:11.378
if you can't do that...

1:05:14.214 --> 1:05:16.049
will we be friends forever?

1:05:40.140 --> 1:05:42.309
Now it's time for my question.

1:05:47.114 --> 1:05:49.483
We found your body,
and we know your name.

1:05:52.186 --> 1:05:54.656
What do you want us to do
with these gifts?

1:06:07.802 --> 1:06:09.637
I saw him!
It's okay.

1:06:09.671 --> 1:06:11.305
Don't be afraid.

1:06:11.338 --> 1:06:13.240
He wasn't there, was he?

1:06:13.273 --> 1:06:14.742
Yes, he was.

1:06:16.443 --> 1:06:17.612
It's just us now.

1:06:27.054 --> 1:06:28.756
What do we do?
I don't know.

1:06:32.125 --> 1:06:35.329
-Daisy! What are you doing?
-Please, sit back down.

1:06:35.362 --> 1:06:37.632
Sit down! No.
Stop, Daisy.

1:06:39.266 --> 1:06:42.169
Daisy!
Daisy, just sit down.

1:06:52.446 --> 1:06:53.681
Hey.

1:07:00.153 --> 1:07:01.756
I didn't think
anybody would be home.

1:07:02.857 --> 1:07:04.157
I should have called.

1:07:07.729 --> 1:07:09.162
Is your mom here?

1:07:13.500 --> 1:07:14.536
I, uh...

1:07:17.437 --> 1:07:19.239
I just came
to pick something up.

1:07:49.436 --> 1:07:50.470
I'm gonna...

1:07:52.774 --> 1:07:54.174
I'm gonna get going.

1:07:57.144 --> 1:07:58.680
I shouldn't have come, but...

1:08:00.447 --> 1:08:01.783
Where have you been?

1:08:05.653 --> 1:08:07.220
It's complicated, Daisy.

1:08:11.659 --> 1:08:15.763
- You should talk to your mom.
Okay?

1:08:20.300 --> 1:08:21.603
I'm sorry.

1:08:54.869 --> 1:08:56.269
Don't leave.

1:09:03.578 --> 1:09:05.613
We can't stay
here forever.

1:09:07.582 --> 1:09:11.753
Maybe not forever,
but a little while longer.

1:09:28.636 --> 1:09:30.705
<i>Mom. Hey, can--</i>

1:09:30.738 --> 1:09:33.608
<i>Daisy.</i>
<i>Daisy, where have you been?</i>
<i>Where have you been?</i>

1:09:33.641 --> 1:09:36.276
- <i>Where is she?</i>
- Just at our house.

1:09:36.309 --> 1:09:37.912
<i>You're at our house?</i>

1:09:37.945 --> 1:09:40.782
<i>Oh, my God. Okay. Um...</i>

1:09:40.815 --> 1:09:42.850
- <i>They're at home.</i>
<i>- Oh, my gosh.</i>

1:09:42.884 --> 1:09:46.854
<i>They're there.</i>
Hey, can I have a sleepover?

1:09:46.888 --> 1:09:50.424
<i>A sleepover?</i>
<i>Are they with you?</i>
<i>Are your friends with you?</i>

1:09:51.258 --> 1:09:52.694
-Yeah.
<i>-They're with her.</i>

1:09:52.727 --> 1:09:54.428
<i>They want to have</i>
<i>a sleepover or something.</i>

1:09:54.461 --> 1:09:56.664
<i>- They're there.</i>
<i>- Thank God.</i>

1:09:56.698 --> 1:10:00.400
- Um, Mom...
<i>- Honey, yes. What is it?</i>

1:10:04.706 --> 1:10:05.873
He was here.

1:10:20.722 --> 1:10:21.756
Hey.

1:10:23.725 --> 1:10:24.759
Hey.

1:10:38.539 --> 1:10:39.574
D--

1:10:42.877 --> 1:10:44.712
How-- How do you feel?

1:10:46.581 --> 1:10:47.615
Just that?

1:10:51.753 --> 1:10:54.756
Do you wanna...
Why didn't you
tell me the truth?

1:11:03.396 --> 1:11:05.298
That's fair. Um...

1:11:09.871 --> 1:11:12.540
I really, um...

1:11:14.575 --> 1:11:16.343
I tried.

1:11:16.376 --> 1:11:19.814
I did.
You really should have
told me the truth.

1:11:21.983 --> 1:11:23.283
I tried.

1:11:26.087 --> 1:11:30.057
If I--
If I had told you,
Daisy, then...

1:11:32.693 --> 1:11:33.795
then it would all...

1:11:36.864 --> 1:11:38.498
then it-- then it's real.

1:11:41.969 --> 1:11:44.437
And I... ...you know...

1:11:46.941 --> 1:11:50.645
I wasn't ready for that.

1:11:52.580 --> 1:11:54.048
But you're-- you're right.

1:11:55.049 --> 1:11:58.886
Was it because of me?
Was it my fault?

1:11:59.821 --> 1:12:00.855
No.

1:12:01.856 --> 1:12:02.990
Good God.

1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:06.794
No.

1:12:13.167 --> 1:12:14.869
Why would you say that?

1:12:15.770 --> 1:12:17.404
He didn't want us.

1:12:22.143 --> 1:12:23.376
I do.

1:12:25.012 --> 1:12:27.949
I want us too.
- You do? Good.

1:12:27.982 --> 1:12:29.851
'Cause that's what you got.

1:12:39.927 --> 1:12:41.361
Oh, man.

1:12:42.495 --> 1:12:43.764
You're a good one.

1:12:46.167 --> 1:12:49.537
You're a good one too.
Thanks.

1:12:55.843 --> 1:12:57.144
Hi.

1:13:14.929 --> 1:13:17.198
Hey, can I--
Let me-- Let me help you.

1:13:17.231 --> 1:13:18.966
- No. No. No.
- No worries.

1:13:20.635 --> 1:13:24.437
Man, I feel like, you know,
you reach a certain age,

1:13:24.471 --> 1:13:28.776
and suddenly you sort of
forget to make new friends.

1:13:28.809 --> 1:13:31.444
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

1:13:31.478 --> 1:13:34.882
It can happen at any age.
Thank you. Thank you.

1:13:34.916 --> 1:13:39.020
We were
just like them once, right?
I mean, do you remember that?

1:13:39.053 --> 1:13:40.721
- Don't know.
- God, I do.

1:13:40.755 --> 1:13:43.524
I-I like to think so.
But I don't really remember.

1:13:43.557 --> 1:13:44.592
Man.

1:13:56.904 --> 1:13:57.939
You guys.

1:16:00.795 --> 1:16:02.163
<i>In the fall,</i>

1:16:03.264 --> 1:16:05.299
<i>I guess some things die</i>

1:16:06.734 --> 1:16:08.936
<i>to leave room for new things.</i>

1:16:11.005 --> 1:16:14.175
<i>I don't know if that's</i>
<i>a good thing or a bad thing.</i>

1:16:15.376 --> 1:16:16.844
<i>It's just a thing.</i>

1:16:17.878 --> 1:16:19.346
<i>It's just the way it is.</i>

1:16:33.727 --> 1:16:35.329
Can we all keep hanging out?

1:17:10.331 --> 1:17:11.732
He's gone.

1:17:15.703 --> 1:17:16.837
Our tree.

1:17:35.756 --> 1:17:38.058
Maybe he was never really here.

1:19:42.483 --> 1:19:44.351
I don't want
this weekend to end.

1:19:45.853 --> 1:19:47.354
I don't want us to end.

1:19:49.256 --> 1:19:50.991
I love you guys.

1:19:51.025 --> 1:19:54.295
I love that I get to be alive
when you're all alive.

1:20:00.067 --> 1:20:04.171
Let's never not be friends.

1:20:05.339 --> 1:20:06.373
Okay?
