00:41.166 --> 00:43.833
What is the responsibility
of those with power?

00:44.708 --> 00:49.625
Do they merely have an obligation
to refrain from the misuse of that power?

00:49.750 --> 00:52.166
Or do they have a duty
to protect those without it?

00:52.250 --> 00:53.750
DENNIS: Two rhetorical questions.

00:53.833 --> 00:55.916
The defendant used
their limitless resources,

00:56.000 --> 01:00.791
political and monetary, for financial gain
at the expense of public safety,

01:00.875 --> 01:03.750
-causing the deaths of innocent people.
-DENNIS: It's so wordy.

01:03.833 --> 01:07.208
They did this because they believed
they would not be held accountable.

01:07.291 --> 01:11.416
That their power shielded them
from very real consequences.

01:11.916 --> 01:15.250
But today, you, the jury,
can prove that's not the case.

01:15.333 --> 01:16.333
DENNIS: More smiles.

01:16.458 --> 01:18.416
Show them that they will
be held accountable,

01:18.791 --> 01:21.000
because those with the most power

01:21.875 --> 01:23.500
have the most to answer for.

01:23.916 --> 01:25.916
And you win the case.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.208
And you are not helpful here at all.

01:28.291 --> 01:30.500
This is gonna land better coming from me.

01:30.583 --> 01:33.666
Plenty of time to switch
things up and let me do the closing.

01:34.208 --> 01:36.083
Dennis, you don't know but I will kill you

01:36.166 --> 01:38.708
and Jen won't prosecute.
So I will get away with it.

01:38.791 --> 01:41.583
It's a conflict of interest.
I don't condone murder. Bye, Dennis.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.791
You're gonna listen to a paralegal
over a lawyer?

01:43.875 --> 01:45.166
Yeah.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.250
-This is unprofessional.
-That was so good.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.500
-It was so good.
-Seriously?

01:48.583 --> 01:52.166
How you used the weight of civic duty
during your closing argument?

01:52.250 --> 01:53.791
I almost cried during parts of it.

01:53.875 --> 01:55.916
Now top it off
with a savage Jen Walters look.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.291
What? I don't have a savage
Jen Walters look.

01:58.375 --> 01:59.541
There it is.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.750
-That was perfect.
-Okay. Really?

02:01.833 --> 02:03.791
-Do you think so?
-(CHUCKLING) Yes. Come on.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.166
It's amazing. It's so great.

02:05.250 --> 02:09.541
Jen, there is a reason why you were
handpicked to go against GLK and H, okay?

02:09.625 --> 02:11.666
The leveling up is happening.
This is good.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.458
My little genius is gonna be
a district attorney one day.

02:14.541 --> 02:18.500
Ah, maybe one day,
but right now I just need to

02:18.625 --> 02:20.458
-stick the landing on this case.
-You will.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.958
And if it doesn't go our way,
you can just Hulk out?

02:24.041 --> 02:25.083
Blow everyone's minds?

02:25.166 --> 02:28.625
Well, the only Hulking out I'm gonna do
is in the legal sense.

02:28.708 --> 02:29.916
Oh, no, Jen.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.750
-No?
-NIKKI: No, that's not funny, Jen.

02:31.833 --> 02:34.208
-I only tell it to you.
-Yeah.

02:34.291 --> 02:35.666
-(CHUCKLES)
-One sec.

02:35.750 --> 02:36.916
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

02:37.291 --> 02:41.500
Yeah, about that. Um, it's true.
I am a Hulk.

02:41.583 --> 02:43.625
Uh, and I'm guessing you won't be able to

02:43.708 --> 02:46.541
focus on this fun lawyer show
until you know all about that.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.208
So, let me get you up to speed.

02:49.250 --> 02:52.166
<i>A few months ago, I went on a road trip</i>
<i>with my cousin Bruce.</i>

02:52.250 --> 02:55.333
BRUCE: Yeah, and it worked.
I mean, my arm started to heal.

02:55.416 --> 02:58.125
-No one thought it was...
-JENNIFER: <i>Yes, that Bruce.</i>

02:58.208 --> 03:01.958
It's all because I made this little device
which keeps me in human form.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.791
That was the longest answer to
"what've you been up to" I've ever heard.

03:05.916 --> 03:08.791
-Well, you asked me, so I answered.
-(GRUNTS)

03:08.916 --> 03:10.875
(STUTTERS) What's up with this?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.375
-Cheetos and chopsticks?
-Yes.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.708
So you don't get Cheetos fingers.

03:15.791 --> 03:19.875
-My God. That's really smart.
-You're not the only genius in the family.

03:19.958 --> 03:22.208
No, there's also Ched.

03:22.291 --> 03:26.041
Okay. So, back to what
I was saying before, my theory.

03:26.208 --> 03:27.250
-Oh, God.
-Um,

03:27.333 --> 03:30.375
Steve Rogers did not have a girlfriend
before he went into the service.

03:30.916 --> 03:33.041
-Says who?
-The History Channel.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.041
So, he becomes Captain America.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.333
And from that moment on,
a symbol of America,

03:37.416 --> 03:40.416
he is rushed to the frontlines,
he becomes a war hero.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.708
-Then he is frozen in ice.
-Right.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.833
JENNIFER: So, based on everything
you've told me,

03:46.291 --> 03:49.458
after he gets unfrozen,
he goes from world-threatening disaster

03:49.541 --> 03:51.125
to world-threatening disaster.

03:51.208 --> 03:53.875
That's when he's not
a fugitive from the law, right?

03:53.958 --> 03:57.708
So it seems like
he was pretty, pretty busy.

03:57.791 --> 03:59.500
All you're doing is repeating everything

03:59.583 --> 04:01.708
that I've told you about
my friend and colleague.

04:01.791 --> 04:04.916
-Obviously, Captain America was a virgin.

-I can't do it, Jen.
-Yes, you can.

11:53.708 --> 11:56.416
Jen, I have been struggling
with this for years.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.333
The best that I could do
was merge my two halves.

11:59.416 --> 12:02.291
Give it time in the lab,
we could possibly do the same for you.

12:02.375 --> 12:05.041
No. No. I don't want to be a Hulk.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.083
God. I just got my own office.

12:07.166 --> 12:08.708
-This is it.
-I have business cards.

12:08.791 --> 12:11.625
There is no goin' back
to what you were before.

(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

12:13.666 --> 12:14.666
Oh, what?

12:15.708 --> 12:17.333

12:18.708 --> 12:20.708

12:32.083 --> 12:33.083
Listen...

12:35.625 --> 12:37.000
I know this is hard to hear,

12:37.083 --> 12:40.000
but you're gonna have to change
the way you live your life now.

12:40.666 --> 12:44.000
Avoid stressful situations,
stay away from people and...

12:44.083 --> 12:46.541
I can't stay away from people.
How am I supposed to work?

12:46.708 --> 12:48.708
You can't go back to your job.

12:50.583 --> 12:53.916
You stay here until you figure out
how to control your Hulk self.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.416
Well, how long is that gonna take?

12:55.500 --> 13:00.083
(SIGHS) This is a multi-year journey
you're about to embark on,

13:00.166 --> 13:02.333
on coming to terms with being the Hulk.

13:02.416 --> 13:05.333
I traced all of my steps
through my evolution.

13:05.416 --> 13:09.000
I never thought that it would end up
being a syllabus, but here we are.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.541
Now, with my help, hopefully,

13:11.625 --> 13:14.416
your progress will go
a little bit faster than mine.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.041
(SMACKS LIPS) You said "multi-year"?

13:16.958 --> 13:18.750
About 15 years, give or take.

13:18.833 --> 13:19.833
Fifteen years?

13:19.916 --> 13:22.291
Our top priority is to control
when you turn.

13:22.375 --> 13:23.375
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

13:26.875 --> 13:30.166
I thought the point was to prevent me
from turning into a Hulk.

13:30.666 --> 13:34.041
These transformations are triggered
by distressed emotional states

13:34.125 --> 13:37.375
so we need to know the exact
threshold that causes it for you.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.083
Ooh! Put on a Pixar movie.

of the wagon in <i>Inside Out.</i>

13:42.791 --> 13:43.958
Bing Bong. No. No.

13:44.041 --> 13:45.041
Stop.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.500
I need to focus.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.041
The triggers are anger and fear.

13:49.125 --> 13:53.208
(SCOFFS) Those are, like, the baseline
of any woman just existing.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.500

Jen?

14:42.541 --> 14:43.541
Yeah?

14:44.125 --> 14:47.375
Wait. You're still Jen right now?

14:47.458 --> 14:48.666
Yeah.

14:49.458 --> 14:50.750
And I'm conscious.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.458
This is incredible.
You don't have an alter ego.

14:53.541 --> 14:55.166
You're the only one in there?

14:55.250 --> 14:56.875
As far as I can tell.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.666
BRUCE: This is huge, Jen.

14:58.750 --> 14:59.833
I think I'm jealous.

Is that what I'm feeling? I'm feeling...

(INHALES SHARPLY) You don't have
another guy to wrestle with for 10 years.

Bruh.

15:09.791 --> 15:14.125
You know, that's about a million dollars'
worth of damage back there, by the way.

15:14.750 --> 15:18.750
(SIGHS) You really don't feel like there's
another hand on the wheel at all?

(SIGHS) No.

15:22.375 --> 15:23.583
It's just me.

15:23.916 --> 15:27.458

barely remember what was happening,

15:27.541 --> 15:31.166
but now it's like it settled in.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.958
BRUCE: Hmm. Well,

15:34.125 --> 15:37.583
I guess we can just skip all that, then.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.000
Yeah, kinda seems like I'm done here.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.041
(LAUGHS) Not so fast.

15:43.583 --> 15:47.125
You still can't control
when you transform.

15:47.208 --> 15:49.833
Okay, so how do I turn back into Jen?

15:49.916 --> 15:51.250
How did you do it?

15:51.333 --> 15:54.833
Usually, I fall out of a jet
or I get knocked out by a robot,

15:54.916 --> 15:56.125
and I'd wake up as Banner.

15:56.208 --> 16:00.250
Or Natasha, for a little while,
would tell me a lullaby.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.333
Walk me through how that worked, again.

16:03.041 --> 16:04.875
I don't have a great explanation for it.

16:04.958 --> 16:08.250
Okay, it seems like the common thread,
though, is being unconscious.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.416
Not necessarily.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.250
One time, I was stuck
as the other guy for over two years.

16:13.708 --> 16:14.791
That was in outer space.

16:14.875 --> 16:18.458

-BRUCE: I said "one time."

16:18.916 --> 16:20.250
Whoa.

16:20.708 --> 16:23.375
You have so much more
to learn about being a Hulk.

16:23.458 --> 16:27.458
I don't think you have thought through
how dangerous this level of power is.

16:27.541 --> 16:30.041
Do you know the damage you can cause?

16:30.333 --> 16:34.375
(EXHALES) I mean, one mistake,
one freak-out is literally life or death.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.125
Okay, I'll be careful.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.291
You can't be emotional.

16:38.375 --> 16:40.083
Forget Hulk rage.

16:40.416 --> 16:44.083
Just regular anger means
death and destruction for everything

16:44.166 --> 16:45.250

BRUCE: Dialectical behavioral therapy.

17:00.666 --> 17:04.375
It allows us to hold two
opposing truths at the same time.

17:04.458 --> 17:08.166
First, we're gonna practice some
mindfulness with a few yoga techniques.

I never thought you'd be into
all this mind-body-spirit stuff.

(EXHALES) Dialectical behavioral therapy
is an evidence-based psychotherapy.

21:52.291 --> 21:55.791
use my law degree that I'm still
paying off a fortune in student loans for.

21:55.875 --> 21:57.250
It's not one or the other, Jen.

21:57.333 --> 22:01.500
I am trying to show you that we can live
between what we want and what is.

22:01.875 --> 22:05.208
But we can't pretend like we aren't
two of the few people on Earth

22:05.291 --> 22:06.750
that can actually protect her.

22:06.833 --> 22:11.000
Which is why we have to make sure
of your ability to tolerate the stress

22:11.083 --> 22:14.791
and regulate your emotions,
especially your anger.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.875
Here's the thing, Bruce.
I'm great at controlling my anger.

22:17.958 --> 22:19.583
-Hmm.
-I do it all the time.

22:20.166 --> 22:22.875
(STUTTERS) When I'm catcalled
in the street,

22:23.708 --> 22:27.458
when incompetent men explain
my own area of expertise to me.

22:27.541 --> 22:30.750
I do it pretty much every day
because if I don't,

22:30.833 --> 22:37.000
I will get called emotional, or difficult,
or might just literally get murdered.

22:37.083 --> 22:42.875
So I'm an expert at controlling my anger
because I do it infinitely more than you.

22:42.958 --> 22:47.500
So all of this just feels like
projecting a lot of shit onto me.

22:48.666 --> 22:49.708
See?

22:49.833 --> 22:51.666
No. I'm doing this.

23:09.166 --> 23:10.166
Jen, stop.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.916
Just stop and think it
through for a minute.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.333
This is all I've been
thinking about, Bruce.

23:14.416 --> 23:18.291
I did your dialectical behavior therapy,
I can change back and forth,

23:18.375 --> 23:21.041
and I'm happy to now get back to my life.

23:21.125 --> 23:22.625
I know you didn't ask for this,

23:22.708 --> 23:26.166
but whether you like it or not,
you're now a superhero.

23:26.250 --> 23:29.791
And who's gonna protect the world
if it isn't people like us?

23:29.875 --> 23:31.333
Are you quoting a comic right now?

23:32.416 --> 23:36.416
I'm sorry. The idea of being a superhero
is not appealing to me.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.500
I'm not you.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.625
And I'm not gonna become you.

23:39.708 --> 23:43.166
I don't need to join some secret
government contractor squad

23:43.250 --> 23:45.958
and have my entire life
taken away from me.

23:46.041 --> 23:48.875
-My life wasn't taken away.
-Really?

23:48.958 --> 23:52.541
Oh, so you didn't wind up alone,
hiding away on some remote beach

23:52.625 --> 23:56.333
with no friends, no relationships,
never seeing your family,

23:56.416 --> 23:59.583
and definitely not dealing
with a decade's worth of trauma?

23:59.875 --> 24:01.791
Why would you want that for me, Bruce?

24:02.458 --> 24:03.875
You're a cautionary tale.

24:03.958 --> 24:06.500
That's the price you have to pay
for keeping the world safe.
