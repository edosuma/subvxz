00:11.511 --> 00:15.242
<i>There's a thing that happens</i>
<i>when people find out you're a doctor.</i>

00:18.251 --> 00:20.151
Good morning.

00:21.521 --> 00:25.389
Did you...

00:26.826 --> 00:30.455
- ...patter?
- Propose? No. Not yet.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.829
You'll be the first to know.

00:32.866 --> 00:36.393
<i>They stop seeing you as a person</i>
<i>and begin to see you as something</i>

00:36.436 --> 00:39.701
- <i>bigger than you are.</i>
- How's she doing?

00:39.739 --> 00:42.173
She's, uh... OK.

00:43.143 --> 00:44.770
She's OK.

00:44.811 --> 00:47.371
<i>They have to see us that way, as gods.</i>

00:47.414 --> 00:50.042
<i>Otherwise we're just</i>
<i>like everyone else.</i>

00:50.083 --> 00:53.348
<i>Unsure, flawed, normal.</i>

00:56.156 --> 00:58.954
- How's she doing?
- No change. This the MCA Doppler?

00:58.992 --> 01:01.017
Yeah. Can I get you anything?
Coffee?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.153
I'm fine, thanks.

01:02.195 --> 01:05.596
<i>So we act strong, we remain stoic.</i>

01:05.632 --> 01:10.092
<i>We hide the fact</i>
<i>that we're all too human.</i>

01:10.136 --> 01:14.163
He still beating himself up? Addison
thinks he's still beating himself up.

01:14.207 --> 01:16.573
- Alex...
- The head of Neuro hasn't left

01:16.609 --> 01:19.476
- his patient's bedside for three days.
- He's fine.

01:19.512 --> 01:22.675
- I thought Addison left.
- She put her brother on a plane.

01:23.683 --> 01:28.120
Admit it, her hanging
around your guy, it bugs.

01:28.154 --> 01:30.645
It doesn't bug. You bug.

01:30.690 --> 01:34.717
Karev, page Addison.
Tell her I need her to stay.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.493
OK, it bugs a little.

01:37.530 --> 01:41.227
The lack of blood flow is causing
the mini-strokes and aphasia.

01:41.267 --> 01:46.398
We can't put the surgery off any longer.
I'll do a repair called an EC-IC bypass.

01:46.439 --> 01:50.068
And that will fix the strokes?
She'll be better after this?

01:50.110 --> 01:53.079
- I'm hoping it will work, yes.
- But, uh...

01:55.281 --> 01:59.149
They wouldn't operate unless it were
safe for the baby. Dr. Montgomery?

01:59.185 --> 02:03.246
Your blood pressure's high, but I'll
be there to monitor you and the baby.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.189
Get some rest. We'll see you soon.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.562
- Thank you for staying.
- Least I could do for saving Archie.

02:09.596 --> 02:10.995
Um...

02:12.432 --> 02:14.992
I know what we said before
about the baby,

02:15.034 --> 02:20.233
but if something should happen, if it
comes down to a choice, save my wife.

02:20.273 --> 02:23.436
We can make another baby.
We can't make another her.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.949
Fifty-two-year-old male,
fell down stairs.

02:30.984 --> 02:35.353
Five days post-op from a cholecystectomy
which looks to have caused the fall.

02:35.388 --> 02:38.221
Why would having your gallbladder
removed cause a fall?

02:42.762 --> 02:45.230
A non-laparoscopic cholie?

02:45.265 --> 02:48.325
Sir, what hospital
did you have your operation at?

02:48.368 --> 02:52.600
- Here. My surgeon was Dr. Campbell.
- That explains it.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.267
Excuse us for a moment.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.144
All right, what?

02:59.179 --> 03:03.047
Campbell was Seattle Grace's
first female surgeon.

03:03.082 --> 03:06.848
Mostly she just sits in her office
and spreads prestige around.

03:06.886 --> 03:09.480
She still does the routine surgery
now and then.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.286
Botches routine surgery.
I'll page the chief.

03:12.325 --> 03:16.523
- No, page Campbell. It's her patient.
- And let her maim the guy again?

03:16.563 --> 03:18.793
Page someone who knows how to operate,

03:18.831 --> 03:21.994
instead of some dinosaur
who refuses to retire her scalpel

03:22.035 --> 03:24.299
and go join her friends in Boca.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.929
The dinosaur is here.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.808
No need to page me.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.716
- So did you scope her out yet?
- Who?

03:37.750 --> 03:39.809
- Arizona.
- Oh, right.

03:39.852 --> 03:43.481
I haven't had a chance to swing by
Peds and ask the nurse to point out

03:43.523 --> 03:46.356
the attending who kissed my friend
in a bar bathroom.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.418
- At least you're still good for coffee.
- Not for you.

03:49.462 --> 03:54.559
- Coffee. Why, thank you, Mark.
- That's not for you either.

03:54.601 --> 03:59.368
- Good morning, Dr. Grey.
- You can keep your secret coffee.

03:59.405 --> 04:03.000
Until you tell Derek, our relationship
continues to consist

04:03.042 --> 04:06.011
of hiding in the attic
and me smuggling snacks past Mer.

04:06.045 --> 04:08.377
- Know what that makes you?
- Your boyfriend?

04:08.414 --> 04:12.214
Anne Frank. I'm dating Anne Frank,
and I'm tired of it.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.619
I want to go downstairs.
I wanna tell the Germans to kiss my ass.

04:15.655 --> 04:20.591
I'm gonna tell him. Soon. When I do,
you'll be my date to the wedding.

04:20.627 --> 04:23.687
- Derek proposed?
- Not yet. But when he does.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.767
This is the first step
in the start of a new life.

04:30.803 --> 04:33.237
How are we feeling?
Positive? Confident?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.798
I am good. Great.

04:35.842 --> 04:39.744
- You take care of your own feelings.
- Peds Surgery is super competitive.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.475
Why I'm armed
with letters of recommendation

04:42.515 --> 04:46.042
to put the competition to shame.
Shepherd says I'm talented.

04:46.085 --> 04:48.383
Sloan finds it an honor
to work with me...

04:48.421 --> 04:51.720
- What does the chief think?
- I'm still working on that.

04:51.758 --> 04:55.159
Chief's recommendation matters.
Everyone on the committee...

04:55.194 --> 04:58.630
I know! You calm down.
I've got it under control.

04:58.665 --> 05:02.192
Good. Because speaking on behalf of me,

05:02.235 --> 05:05.727
we couldn't be more excited
to have you. Yay.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.634
Chief? Just a friendly nudge.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.304
Your recommendation is due
by the end of the day.

05:12.345 --> 05:13.972
- I'll remind Patricia.
- You have written it?

05:14.013 --> 05:16.709
You'll get your recommendation.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.310
- I need more time.
- No.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.083
Don't get me wrong.
I am honored that you asked me

05:23.122 --> 05:25.022
over all the other residents,

05:25.058 --> 05:29.791
but it's not easy distilling a doctor
of your stature to 500 words or less.

05:29.829 --> 05:34.766
I chose you because you're the only one
to do this without screwing up. Don't.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.763
Make sure he planes the patio...

05:40.406 --> 05:43.842
- Plates the...
- We'll get him piano lessons. Yes.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.436
Only puddle shell... uh.

05:46.479 --> 05:49.175
Only public...

05:49.215 --> 05:52.241
Public school so he doesn't
become a snob, I know.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.480
But I don't have to.
You're gonna be there

05:54.520 --> 05:57.318
to make sure I don't
turn him into a jerk.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.616
We're here.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.953
I love just...

06:03.996 --> 06:05.827
I know. You love me.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.528
And I love you.
I'll see you in a few.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.337
Thank you.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.534
Her blood pressure's higher
than it was yesterday.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.011
- We can't wait.
- I know...

06:20.046 --> 06:22.844
You want me to be aware.
You're a good doctor. So am I.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.112
Let's just be good together.

06:25.151 --> 06:28.848
- Your and my guy work well together.
- My guy works well with everyone.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.624
- Dr. Stevens?
- Yes.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.820
Think we'll get
to scrub in on a surgery?

06:35.862 --> 06:39.423
You think you're capable
of holding someone's life in your hands

06:39.465 --> 06:43.231
when you could barely finish
the intern bowl? Really? Come on.

06:44.704 --> 06:47.400
- Dr. Stevens, remember me?
- Yes.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.932
I was here a couple of days ago
when you told me I might have cancer.

06:50.977 --> 06:54.174
You sent me to an oncologist,
who sent me to an immunologist,

06:54.213 --> 06:57.444
who then sent me to some other ologist
I never heard of

06:57.483 --> 07:03.444
before I set foot in this deathtrap.
80 thousand dollars in tests later,

07:03.489 --> 07:07.016
the only thing wrong with me
is that I'm anemic!

07:07.059 --> 07:09.357
- Anemic?
- My lawyer seems to think

07:09.395 --> 07:11.920
that someone here
mislabeled the blood.

07:11.964 --> 07:15.400
Switched it with someone else's.
I was told not to come here,

07:15.435 --> 07:19.166
but my conscience wanted to make sure
you went through those files

07:19.205 --> 07:21.867
of everybody who was here
at the clinic that day.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.706
Of course we will. I'm so sorry.

07:24.744 --> 07:27.975
Don't apologize to me.
I'm just anemic.

07:28.014 --> 07:31.347
You apologize to that dying person.

08:07.687 --> 08:11.282
- Middle cerebral artery?
- Yes, after I connect the STA,

08:11.324 --> 08:14.316
- we will close.
- Baby's having spontaneous decels.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.557
Mom's hypotensive. I don't know
how much they can handle.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.031
MCA's bleeding.
It shouldn't contribute.

08:20.132 --> 08:23.329
Pressure's dropping.
The baby's gonna need to come out.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.860
- Almost done. Wait.
- Not me that can't wait.

08:25.905 --> 08:29.272
- The decels are getting more frequent.
- A fetus can't handle

08:29.308 --> 08:31.799
three surgeries.
We have to get the baby out.

08:31.844 --> 08:37.009
- He's too young to come out.
- Last decel lasted a full 30 seconds.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.313
Let's go. I'm taking him out.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.410
- Ten-blade.
- Leave the baby in.

08:44.924 --> 08:47.586
Done. I'm done.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.659
I'm done.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.992
You've got a minor fracture
so you won't need surgery.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.799
You should on your feet
within a few weeks.

08:58.838 --> 09:02.569
I don't know what I was thinking.
The wound wasn't healing as fast...

09:02.608 --> 09:05.941
Next time, you call me, John.

09:05.978 --> 09:08.845
Dr. Yang, explain to my patient

09:08.881 --> 09:11.281
what you feel
I should have done differently

09:11.317 --> 09:16.619
in order to avoid this complication.
Don't be shy, Dr. Yang.

09:16.656 --> 09:22.458
OK. Well, patients status post
minimally invasive procedures

09:22.495 --> 09:26.056
have been shown to have decreased
post-surgical discomfort...

09:26.098 --> 09:29.659
In human please, Dr. Yang.

09:32.038 --> 09:35.030
This surgery should have
been done laparoscopically.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.975
Dr. Hunt, perhaps
you can explain to Dr. Yang

09:38.010 --> 09:40.604
why I chose to do the surgery this way.

09:40.646 --> 09:44.514
Although some doctors prefer
to use the new technology,

09:44.550 --> 09:47.041
there are others who believe
it's more risky

09:47.086 --> 09:50.522
since we can't see or move around
as much during the surgery.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.116
It's half a dozen either way.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.228
Bravo, Dr. Hunt.

09:57.263 --> 10:00.096
- Do you understand, John?
- Yes.

10:00.132 --> 10:02.692
I have no doubt you did
the right thing by me.

10:02.735 --> 10:07.263
Wonderful. Now, Dr. Yang,

10:07.306 --> 10:10.434
please take our patient to CT.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.967
Maybe you'll learn something
in the process.

10:13.012 --> 10:18.279
While I confer with Dr. Hunt
about our course of treatment.

10:22.521 --> 10:24.989
- I'm on a deadline.
- Sadie Harris mislabeled

10:25.024 --> 10:27.993
a patient's blood sample.
The clinic's getting sued.

10:28.027 --> 10:31.155
- Good thing Sadie no longer works here.
- No, it's not.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.961
Because it isn't just her.
The interns, all of them,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.902
they're capable of the same mistake.
They are dangerous and they are bad.

10:37.937 --> 10:40.997
Don't tell me I'm overly emotional
and it isn't personal!

10:41.040 --> 10:44.407
Because it is personal!
I've worked so hard to teach them,

10:44.443 --> 10:47.844
- and... and it is personal.
- Stevens.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.348
I thought the same thing
about you every day

10:50.383 --> 10:54.410
for the first year you worked here.
Know what the chief told me?

10:54.453 --> 10:56.353
Get out.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.718
You don't get much rest,
do you, Dr. Shepherd?

11:08.501 --> 11:12.335
- Did you hear yourself just then?
- Oh, my God!

11:12.371 --> 11:15.829
Oh, my God! I can talk!

11:15.875 --> 11:18.742
I know! Listen to you!

11:21.313 --> 11:23.781
And the baby?
How's the baby?

11:23.816 --> 11:26.546
The baby's stable. However,

11:26.585 --> 11:29.076
your new labs show
that you're pre-eclamptic.

11:29.121 --> 11:32.955
We hoped to keep it from progressing
to this stage, but stress of surgery

11:32.992 --> 11:37.088
- was a lot on your body.
- So do we need to be worried?

11:39.498 --> 11:43.264
Come on! Dr. Shepherd, please tell
me we're done being worried.

11:45.504 --> 11:48.029
First moment of hope
they've had in a week.

11:48.074 --> 11:51.305
Pre-eclampsia is serious.
You're too close to this patient.

11:51.343 --> 11:54.710
Stop fighting me on this.
We had a victory. Focus on that.

11:54.747 --> 11:59.207
We give the family all the information.
That's our job, Derek.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.620
- Looks like my guy won that round.
- Meredith?

12:03.656 --> 12:06.921
Karev, can you go get
Jen's blood test results?

12:06.959 --> 12:09.484
Give me a reason
why I shouldn't go to the chief.

12:09.528 --> 12:13.089
- What? The surgery was a success.
- He made a mistake in her first.

12:13.132 --> 12:16.226
He caused complications.
He feels responsible.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.327
Tell me why I shouldn't go to the chief.

12:18.370 --> 12:21.533
During the trial, he lost patients.
It affected him.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.533
For the better, I think.
He cares more, if that's possible.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.412
You just have to trust him.

12:29.448 --> 12:30.745
OK.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.320
- Hey.
- Calliope.

12:42.361 --> 12:45.797
- I haven't seen you around.
- Well, I've been avoiding you.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.890
I know, it's so weird.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.697
You share a kiss with a woman
you've never seen...

12:50.736 --> 12:54.695
Honestly, this is a new adventure,
one I'm so ready to take,

12:54.740 --> 12:58.642
for the second time, and...
Anyway.

12:58.677 --> 13:01.976
Do you want to go on a date with me?

13:02.014 --> 13:05.506
Wait, Erica and you.
She was your first?

13:05.551 --> 13:08.543
- Yeah.
- Oh.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.886
OK. So then I guess
my answer is no.

13:11.924 --> 13:15.087
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. What?

13:15.327 --> 13:17.852
Uh... Um...

13:18.464 --> 13:22.264
You kissed me, out of nowhere,
in a bathroom.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.132
OK, this is what I try to avoid.

13:24.170 --> 13:29.233
You're all exploring
and experimenting and...

13:29.275 --> 13:33.473
Yay! This is a really
exciting time for you.

13:33.512 --> 13:37.073
But I work in Peds.
I spend my entire day around newborns.

13:37.116 --> 13:40.085
So I try not to in my personal life.

13:40.119 --> 13:44.146
Thanks for asking, though.
I'm super flattered.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.851
Super.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.898
- As discussed.
- Thank you.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.538
Newborn.
I'm not a newborn.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.476
I'm a senior resident.
I'm a great surgeon.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.741
I'm a divorcee, for God's sake.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.873
I'm...

14:09.915 --> 14:14.147
I'm, uh... looking for you to agree
with me here, Bailey.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.917
- Bailey?
- The chief,

14:17.957 --> 14:20.357
he wrote me a form letter
of recommendation.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.792
That's insane.
He's chief, you're Bailey.

14:22.828 --> 14:26.389
"Pleasant in the OR
and enjoyed by the nurses.

14:26.432 --> 14:29.799
She's completed a serviceable
amount of research.

14:29.835 --> 14:35.102
- A fine addition to any program."
- Fine! He used the word "fine."

14:35.140 --> 14:40.077
A blank page would mean more.
I pulled off a 12-person domino surgery.

14:40.112 --> 14:44.048
I took out and put back six
of a dying girl's organs!

14:44.083 --> 14:47.416
I am Dr. Bailey.
I am better than fine!

14:49.188 --> 14:51.088
At least he didn't call you a baby.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.785
Just a minute more, Mr. Terzian.

14:57.696 --> 15:01.029
Oh... Done tending to Her Highness?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.590
You're tough on people.

15:02.635 --> 15:06.503
It's good to hold such high standards,
but this is medicine.

15:06.538 --> 15:09.439
- No one's perfect.
- She's stubborn and out of touch.

15:09.475 --> 15:14.503
- Forty years experience means nothing?
- Not if you don't use them correctly.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.242
She wants to be old
and keep operating? Fine.

15:17.283 --> 15:20.582
- Just keep up with the medicine.
- Cristina, this is one case.

15:20.619 --> 15:23.986
You can't judge someone
based on one case.

15:24.023 --> 15:27.390
That patient deserves to know his
doctor, no matter whose feelings

15:27.426 --> 15:29.053
it happens to hurt.

15:32.164 --> 15:36.328
Laparoscopic or open, none of us
should have made that mistake.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.900
You realize you're
charging one of our hospital's

16:12.938 --> 16:15.566
most respected surgeons
with negligence.

16:15.607 --> 16:18.007
Yes, sir.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.773
Dr. Hunt, do you agree
with Dr. Yang's assessment?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.680
- This is Dr. Yang's call.
- I'm asking you, Dr. Hunt.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.549
Campbell outranks me, sir.

16:26.585 --> 16:30.146
I think it would be best for you
to discuss it with her directly.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.688
Very well. Page Dr. Campbell.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.251
I want to speak
to that patient before surgery.

16:36.295 --> 16:37.990
Yes, sir.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.729
Way to take a stand.

16:44.570 --> 16:48.028
There he is, the legend himself.

16:48.073 --> 16:49.700
How are you, legend?

16:50.976 --> 16:53.410
Are you drunk?
Should I be worried about you?

16:53.445 --> 16:57.040
He's got his sense of humor back.
How's your patient?

16:57.082 --> 17:00.347
She's good, stable.
Today's the first day in a long time

17:00.386 --> 17:03.014
I remember what it feels like
to be good at my job.

17:03.055 --> 17:07.013
You? Come on, you're like
the Dalai Lama of surgery.

17:07.059 --> 17:11.086
People from all over the world come to
let you cut into them. Know what else?

17:11.130 --> 17:14.327
You look good doing it.
I like the facial hair, by the way.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.665
- Keep it that length. No more, no less.
- Stop.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.501
Derek, there's something
we need to discuss.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.030
- Go ahead and have sex with Addison.
- Addison?

17:23.075 --> 17:25.009
- Go for it.
- I don't want to.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.705
Really? What did you want to discuss?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.178
Nothing.

17:35.254 --> 17:36.915
OK.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.663
- How's my mother?
- Bitter.

17:46.698 --> 17:49.064
Angry. Genius.

17:49.101 --> 17:52.696
What's so wrong is how much
the chief and your mother fought.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.730
- Sex must have been great.
- Saying that, that's wrong.

17:55.774 --> 17:59.301
What's wrong? Our entire
healthcare system? 'Cause I agree.

17:59.344 --> 18:01.778
Here it is. "March 3, 1979.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.510
Assisted Margaret Campbell
on a splenectomy.

18:04.550 --> 18:09.146
Impressive resume, adequate technique."
See? Hack! Even then.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.988
- You're working with Margaret Campbell?
- Yeah. Ye Oldy Timey thinks

18:13.025 --> 18:16.461
she's sane enough to do surgery.
That's what I like about your mom.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.986
She wasn't Alzheimer-y
and still operating.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.558
Do me a favor and shoot me
if I start making mistakes on patients

18:22.601 --> 18:25.502
- and think it's kosher to cut.
- Sounds like Shepherd.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.835
- Alex.
- Please, my guy's right.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.569
Your guy nicked an aneurysm
and is trying to cover his ass.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.442
Your guy needs to shut up.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.983
- What happened?
- Bypass must have blown.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.478
- Page Addison, meet us in the OR!
- I told them everything was OK.

18:45.524 --> 18:49.654
Dr. Shepherd? I don't understand.
He said the surgery was a success.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.755
I'll give you an update
as soon as we can, OK?

18:53.966 --> 18:57.527
The swelling's not going down.

18:57.569 --> 19:00.595
Maybe the
ventriculostomy is plugged.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.334
No. Damn it!

19:11.083 --> 19:12.311
Derek?

19:12.351 --> 19:15.548
I have to take out the temporal lobe.

19:16.855 --> 19:19.221
- Won't that kill her?
- No.

19:19.258 --> 19:24.059
She could lose some of her speech,
memory and vocal pattern.

19:24.096 --> 19:28.260
The brain can rewire.
I've done it before to stop seizures.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.666
Have you
done it before for this?

19:33.172 --> 19:35.640
- I'm doing it now.
- Baby's got decels.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.538
What are we doing here, Derek?

19:40.746 --> 19:42.475
Bayonet forceps.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.677
What are we supposed to say?
"Shepherd's cutting out parts

19:45.717 --> 19:48.117
of your wife's brain.
She'll pull through?"

19:48.153 --> 19:51.452
Tell him the truth.
Dr. Shepherd is doing everything he can

19:51.490 --> 19:55.017
- to save your wife and child.
- The guy's life ended. Tell him that.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.960
Alex, just be...

19:56.995 --> 19:59.964
The baby's having heart fluctuations,

19:59.998 --> 20:04.025
but Dr. Montgomery is taking every
precaution to avoid an early delivery.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.435
- And my wife?
- Dr. Shepherd is trying to get

20:06.471 --> 20:11.465
the bleeding under control, but we won't
know more until the surgery's finished.

20:11.510 --> 20:14.138
But she won't die?

20:16.014 --> 20:17.709
Please tell me she won't die.

20:19.351 --> 20:22.616
Shepherd is doing everything
to make sure your wife lives.

20:22.654 --> 20:24.519
She'll live?

20:24.556 --> 20:27.491
Dr. Shepherd is doing
absolutely everything he can.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.790
We should get back.

20:29.828 --> 20:32.353
Right. Of course. Thanks.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.161
- Thank you.
- Your guy sucks.

20:39.972 --> 20:45.137
Mr. Terzian, your scans show a change
from Dr. Campbell's original assessment.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.941
There was a complication
from the surgery,

20:47.980 --> 20:52.246
a lacerated bile duct and artery. You'll
need another surgery to repair it.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.650
- Is that all?
- Yes, that's all.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.779
Oh, thank God!

20:56.822 --> 21:00.314
I thought when they told me
the chief of surgery was coming,

21:00.359 --> 21:03.123
I was a goner for sure.

21:03.161 --> 21:06.028
We simply wanted
to make you aware

21:06.064 --> 21:10.023
that it's within your rights
to request a change of surgeon.

21:10.068 --> 21:13.435
- Dr. Campbell's not available?
- She's available.

21:13.472 --> 21:17.340
No, thank you.
I choose Dr. Campbell.

21:17.376 --> 21:21.107
- Very well. Dr. Campbell.
- Richard.

21:24.883 --> 21:29.149
Sir, with all due respect, I don't think
the patient's clear what happened.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.587
You heard the patient.
He wants his doctor.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.716
- But sir...
- Back down, Yang.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.795
I just need you to tell me
if it's worthy of Dr. Bailey.

21:38.830 --> 21:41.799
Bailey's an ass.
She doesn't listen to residents

21:41.833 --> 21:44.802
when they have important
information about interns.

21:44.836 --> 21:48.966
You're missing the point of
the exercise, to say nice things.

21:53.779 --> 21:55.303
You still hang out here?

21:57.215 --> 22:00.275
George, just say she's dependable.
Say she's selfless.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.447
Everything she was until she wasn't.
Just...

22:03.488 --> 22:05.217
You should probably go.

22:07.025 --> 22:09.118
Dependably selfless.

22:10.095 --> 22:11.926
- Thank you.
- Hm.

22:18.770 --> 22:20.567
Isobel Stevens?

22:30.248 --> 22:33.809
It's been years since I've had you
in my OR, chief.

22:33.852 --> 22:38.186
I seem to remember an incident
with a clamp being dropped

22:38.223 --> 22:39.815
into an open body cavity.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.452
You're never gonna
let me live that one down.

22:42.494 --> 22:45.986
A good teacher never
lets up on her students. Although,

22:46.031 --> 22:49.467
I've often wondered how the
upcoming classes learn anything

22:49.501 --> 22:51.901
with the way we teach these days.

22:51.937 --> 22:56.033
Attendings seem more concerned
with inspiring their students,

22:56.074 --> 22:59.805
using encouragement
and validation and so forth,

22:59.845 --> 23:03.076
instead of instilling them
with the fear and shame

23:03.115 --> 23:06.312
that causes one to
remember anything in the first place.

23:06.351 --> 23:08.945
Dr. Hunt, you come from the military.

23:08.987 --> 23:12.684
Wouldn't you say the rigid aspects
of your training helped you become

23:12.724 --> 23:15.522
- the doctor you are today?
- Yes. Very much so.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.996
Dr. Yang, on the other hand,
something tells me fear

23:19.030 --> 23:22.329
is not something you
have often faced in the OR.

23:23.635 --> 23:25.967
I'd appreciate
any opportunity to learn.

23:26.004 --> 23:29.371
Wonderful. Let us begin then.

23:29.408 --> 23:33.276
Tell me how you'd do
a pulmonary embolectomy.

23:33.311 --> 23:36.246
I'd insert a steerable catheter
into the femoral vein

23:36.281 --> 23:39.148
and position a fluoroscope
adjacent to the embolus.

23:39.184 --> 23:42.950
What would you do
if the power should suddenly go out?

23:45.056 --> 23:50.653
Or if you had to operate in a hospital
that couldn't afford a fluoroscope?

23:52.497 --> 23:56.126
It's like a calculator. Because
there's a machine to do it for them,

23:56.168 --> 23:59.296
children shouldn't have
to learn simple arithmetic?

23:59.337 --> 24:02.534
If it would help them avoid
mistakes like this one.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.348
Out of my OR!

24:13.618 --> 24:15.017
I said get out! Out!

24:16.021 --> 24:18.922
This is still my OR!

24:21.026 --> 24:24.291
She's bleeding into the frontal lobe.
If I can stop the bleed,

24:24.329 --> 24:27.787
save the rest of the brain,
she'll have a chance.

24:30.101 --> 24:32.092
Decels are getting longer.

24:33.238 --> 24:38.471
- I have to deliver the baby.
- No. Just...

24:38.510 --> 24:40.876
If you cut her, she'll bleed.
I can save her.

24:40.912 --> 24:42.277
How?

24:46.651 --> 24:49.449
- I have to cut out the frontal lobe.
- What?

24:50.155 --> 24:53.613
Derek, no. Stop. Derek.
You've done enough.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.058
Can she live without
frontal and temporal?

24:56.094 --> 24:58.562
- Yes.
- No, Derek, she can't.

24:58.597 --> 25:00.588
This baby isn't getting any oxygen.

25:00.632 --> 25:04.124
You want to save Jen, you feel
like you have to, but not this way.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.160
I can save them both.
She will live.

25:06.204 --> 25:09.765
Not as the person her husband
and child need her to be.

25:09.808 --> 25:13.539
She'll lose everything about her
that makes her human.

25:13.578 --> 25:16.775
- Meredith.
- Are you sure you can do this?

25:16.815 --> 25:20.717
- I have no choice. Bipolars.
- Baby's heart rate is bottoming out.

25:20.752 --> 25:24.711
Damn it, Derek!
This has gone too far.

25:24.756 --> 25:28.749
Taking the frontal lobe out, even if
she lives, you're creating a monster.

25:28.793 --> 25:31.318
You don't get to play God here!

25:31.363 --> 25:35.925
Jen is gone, but this baby
has a chance to live. Let her go.

25:35.967 --> 25:38.458
Let it go. Please, let...

25:39.638 --> 25:42.801
- I'm taking the baby out.
- Put down the scalpel, Addison!

25:51.149 --> 25:52.776
You put down the scalpel.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.418
- Addison, put the scalpel down.
- You put the scalpel down!

26:05.463 --> 26:09.024
Get off the scalpel, Addison!
Take it off!

26:12.304 --> 26:14.431
- Meredith...
- Do not go anywhere.

26:17.442 --> 26:19.034
Karev, go!

26:24.149 --> 26:28.142
- Derek, don't do this.
- Do not touch my patient, Addison.

26:42.033 --> 26:43.933
Meredith.

26:46.705 --> 26:50.300
Derek, look at me.
You don't have to do this.

26:50.342 --> 26:54.506
Jen's gone. It's too late.
You can't save her. She's gone.

26:54.546 --> 26:56.480
We can save the baby.

26:57.415 --> 27:00.213
Derek, look at me.

27:04.456 --> 27:08.415
Certain surgeries
get the best of all of us.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.792
I made a mistake.

27:10.829 --> 27:13.957
A careless mistake.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.990
And for that, I am sorry.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.696
But I am only human,

27:18.737 --> 27:21.228
as human as any of us.

27:21.272 --> 27:26.300
And for that, I do not apologize.

27:28.513 --> 27:31.778
- Margaret, you don't have...
- No need to discuss it further.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.114
No need at all.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.279
- Chief, we need you in OR 1!
- Karev?

27:36.321 --> 27:39.347
Right now, sir!

27:44.429 --> 27:46.897
I was fired. From the Army.

27:46.931 --> 27:49.491
They call it an honorable discharge,

27:49.534 --> 27:53.334
but they knew it was my time,
even though I didn't.

27:54.706 --> 27:57.504
I'm grateful to them for that.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.722
The baby's still in distress.
I need to take it out.

28:17.762 --> 28:21.129
Wait. Just wait.
The bleeding could stop.

28:21.166 --> 28:25.034
The baby could stabilize.
We do a C-section now, she'll die.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.732
- She is dead, Derek.
- Please, just wait.

28:27.772 --> 28:31.640
Most of her brain is gone. For all
intents and purposes, she's dead.

28:38.650 --> 28:42.416
Karev, page Dr. Friedman's team.
Tell her we have a preemie on the way.

28:45.824 --> 28:47.621
Stop cutting.

28:52.997 --> 28:55.397
Why are you cutting?

28:55.433 --> 28:58.596
Meredith, get some more blood.
She needs more blood.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.172
Get more blood.

29:02.207 --> 29:05.438
- She needs more blood.
- No more blood, Derek.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.905
No more blood.

29:15.053 --> 29:19.149
You're smart to get it looked at, but
it doesn't look too suspicious to me.

29:19.190 --> 29:22.421
- Even combined with high LDH levels?
- Oh.

29:22.460 --> 29:27.488
That could be caused by anything,
mono, exercise even.

29:27.532 --> 29:31.229
Coupled with neurological episodes?
Hallucinations?

29:33.171 --> 29:36.572
There we go. All done.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.406
You and I both see patients
do this everyday.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.743
Find something suspicious,
convince themselves they're sick.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.773
But as doctors,
you and I both know

29:45.817 --> 29:49.253
that it's our job to remain worry-free

29:49.287 --> 29:52.916
until we have proof that says otherwise.
That's what you should do.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.050
Relax. By this time tomorrow,

29:55.093 --> 29:58.426
you'll be laughing at the fact
you thought anything was wrong.

30:00.598 --> 30:02.327
OK. Ready?

30:04.669 --> 30:07.365
He looks strong.

30:10.141 --> 30:13.907
He definitely has a chance.
Let's get him intubated.

30:13.945 --> 30:16.470
Placenta.

30:40.238 --> 30:44.265
The steroids we gave your wife
allowed your baby's lungs to mature.

30:44.309 --> 30:48.678
That, combined with the three extra days
that Dr. Shepherd took

30:48.713 --> 30:51.944
to do the surgery, makes us
very hopeful that he'll survive.

30:54.452 --> 30:56.977
I don't understand.
She just died?

31:01.426 --> 31:02.859
I'm sorry.

31:06.130 --> 31:08.894
Yeah, I know. You said that. Um...

31:10.101 --> 31:12.626
I'm asking how she died.

31:15.707 --> 31:20.906
We believe your wife's high blood
pressure caused the bypass to fail.

31:20.945 --> 31:24.711
That caused the bleeding
and swelling in the brain.

31:24.749 --> 31:28.845
Dr. Shepherd did everything he could.
There was too much damage to her brain.

31:28.887 --> 31:33.381
That's when Dr. Montgomery
stepped in to deliver the baby.

31:36.694 --> 31:41.131
You said it was a routine procedure,
that she would be fine.

31:41.165 --> 31:43.725
Then there was a complication.

31:43.768 --> 31:45.895
And you said you fixed that.

31:45.937 --> 31:49.168
But then the baby got sick,

31:49.207 --> 31:51.607
and that made Jen sick.

31:51.643 --> 31:55.374
But then you said you fixed that, too.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.643
And now she's dead.

32:00.818 --> 32:04.151
- I'm sorry.
- Stop saying you're sorry!

32:04.188 --> 32:07.180
You killed her!

32:07.225 --> 32:11.457
You're a murderer!
A murderer!

32:11.496 --> 32:13.487
Where's my wife?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.530
I want my wife!

32:18.569 --> 32:20.969
I want my wife!

32:23.975 --> 32:26.034
I want...

32:30.348 --> 32:32.873
I want...

32:36.654 --> 32:38.849
I know it's bad. But I tried.

32:38.890 --> 32:43.259
You're just very complex,
and word-defying.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.488
Chief!

32:45.730 --> 32:50.633
- That is a letter of recommendation!
- O'Malley? Take pointers from O'Malley?

32:50.668 --> 32:54.968
You'd be hard-pressed to find
a better person to take pointers from.

32:55.006 --> 32:58.840
- Chief? Chief!
- Exactly!

32:58.876 --> 33:03.176
I am the chief of surgery. I don't have
time to write letters to pump your ego.

33:03.214 --> 33:05.478
My head of Neuro is called a murderer,

33:05.516 --> 33:08.747
I have to fire my general surgeon
because she won't retire,

33:08.786 --> 33:11.619
interns are mixing up
blood samples in your clinic,

33:11.656 --> 33:15.752
and you want me to spend my time writing
a recommendation so you can leave me?

33:15.793 --> 33:19.092
Leave you? Sir, I am

33:19.130 --> 33:21.963
applying for a fellowship
in pediatric surgery.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.766
Which is not what we had discussed!
Do you know how much time you wasted?

33:25.803 --> 33:28.294
The amount of work
it takes to groom someone?

33:28.339 --> 33:32.036
- You were to become the next me!
- You wanted me to become the next you.

33:32.076 --> 33:33.907
I am not your son or your daughter.

33:33.945 --> 33:36.607
You don't pin all your hopes
and dreams on me, sir!

33:47.025 --> 33:48.322
I'm seeing Lexie.

33:49.694 --> 33:53.130
I'm sleeping with her too,
but it's more than that. We're happy.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.825
I'm happy.

33:59.971 --> 34:03.998
OK, that's... Maybe I deserved that.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.842
You know what? I didn't. You have no
right to tell me who I can sleep with.

34:41.112 --> 34:44.445
You're worried about your legacy.
But I am not your legacy!

34:44.482 --> 34:49.078
And me applying to Peds is not...
You are not listening to me.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.313
What the...?

34:50.353 --> 34:52.379
Oh, my goodness!

34:53.858 --> 34:57.624
Come on. Come on!
Come on, stop. Come on!

34:57.662 --> 35:00.130
Come on.

35:01.466 --> 35:04.629
It's done.

35:08.906 --> 35:10.601
That's her guy.

35:29.694 --> 35:32.288
I'd do a pulmonary arteriotomy,

35:32.330 --> 35:36.596
directly visualize the clot and use
atraumatic forceps to extract it.

35:36.634 --> 35:40.502
That's how I'd do a pulmonary
embolectomy without a fluoroscope.

35:40.538 --> 35:43.837
The fact that you felt
the need to come tell me that

35:43.875 --> 35:47.743
tells me you're a much better surgeon
than I first thought.

35:49.113 --> 35:52.879
I've decided today's surgery
was my last.

35:54.352 --> 35:57.753
You look at me like you won't wake up
one day not that far from now,

35:57.788 --> 36:01.485
so much faster than you can imagine,

36:01.526 --> 36:03.960
and find that you are me.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.726
When you can't cut anymore,

36:07.765 --> 36:10.131
what will you have?

36:10.168 --> 36:13.103
I was a god.

36:13.137 --> 36:17.198
In this OR. Holding a scalpel.

36:17.241 --> 36:18.936
I was a god.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.942
And now...

36:26.751 --> 36:29.515
What will you have?

36:46.037 --> 36:48.699
I don't see anyone
burning the place down.

36:48.739 --> 36:50.104
That's how they do it.

36:50.141 --> 36:53.508
Do everything right. As soon as you
look away, they screw it up.

36:53.544 --> 36:57.036
Hey, I'm sorry.
I was busy earlier.

36:57.081 --> 37:00.482
With myself, I was busy,
so I'm sorry.

37:00.518 --> 37:02.213
Don't be.

37:02.253 --> 37:05.620
I called you an ass.
And you were right.

37:05.656 --> 37:08.853
I think I just needed to vent.

37:08.893 --> 37:12.294
- I'm sick of this place.
- Hell, I just watched Derek Shepherd

37:12.330 --> 37:16.232
beat up a man because he's so sick
of it. That's the way it works.

37:16.267 --> 37:21.466
The patients we lose, the mistakes
we make, that's how we learn.

37:21.505 --> 37:25.271
It's the only way it's ever been done.
Figure out a better way, and you

37:25.309 --> 37:27.470
will be a better doctor than us.

37:27.511 --> 37:30.571
<i>Patients see us as gods.</i>

37:35.720 --> 37:38.985
- Izzie?
- <i>Or they see us as monsters.</i>

37:39.023 --> 37:42.925
<i>But the fact is, we're just people.</i>

37:44.662 --> 37:46.527
Hi.

37:47.632 --> 37:49.327
OK, well, it's not broken.

37:49.367 --> 37:53.895
But you should ice it.
Lots and lots of ice. Goodbye.

37:55.873 --> 38:00.970
- I'm so sorry.
- It was worth it.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.640
No. It wasn't.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.306
Maybe a little.

38:07.718 --> 38:09.743
Thank you.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.277
<i>We screw up.</i>

38:14.125 --> 38:16.423
<i>We lose our way.</i>

38:24.568 --> 38:27.662
- I have experience to give.
- Calliope?

38:27.705 --> 38:30.868
Life experience. Like I was married.
Did you know that?

38:30.908 --> 38:35.072
Or that I was in the Peace Corps.
Botswana.

38:35.112 --> 38:39.879
It convinced me to go to med school.
And I've experienced the joy of cooking.

38:39.917 --> 38:44.411
I make an excellent chicken piccata, in
addition to many other delicious meals

38:44.455 --> 38:47.288
you'd be lucky to experience.
That you can't open your eyes

38:47.325 --> 38:50.886
to see that makes you
a little inexperienced.

38:53.097 --> 38:57.625
- Um... Calliope, this is Julie.
- Hi.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.159
My date.

39:04.742 --> 39:07.870
<i>Even the best of us have our off days.</i>

39:14.251 --> 39:18.813
Letter of recommendation.
Callie told me about the chief's.

39:18.856 --> 39:23.190
I figured it was the least I can do
before getting on a plane back to LA.

39:23.227 --> 39:28.665
- Addison Montgomery, thank you!
- Don't thank me. Just kick ass.

39:28.699 --> 39:32.999
Don't make me regret writing you are
the most promising young Peds surgeon

39:33.037 --> 39:35.767
I've ever had the pleasure
of working with.

39:39.143 --> 39:41.077
<i>Still, we move forward.</i>

39:45.349 --> 39:48.876
Today, you were a teacher to someone
who needed to learn,

39:48.919 --> 39:53.083
but you were also a bully to someone
who needed compassion. You were both.

39:53.124 --> 39:56.389
I wasn't a bully.

39:56.427 --> 39:59.419
And... I was right.

39:59.463 --> 40:01.522
Right.

40:01.565 --> 40:05.695
You're a lot like her.
Stubborn, opinionated, smart.

40:05.736 --> 40:10.196
Forty years from now I'll have to pry
that scalpel out of your hand, too.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.209
From my cold dead hands.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.512
You're missing the point.

40:18.015 --> 40:20.347
I wanna be around
40 years from now.

40:40.237 --> 40:45.265
<i>We don't rest on our laurels or</i>
<i>celebrate lives we've saved in the past.</i>

41:05.563 --> 41:08.964
<i>Because there's always some</i>
<i>other patient that needs our help.</i>

41:23.681 --> 41:28.209
<i>So we force ourselves to keep trying,</i>
<i>to keep learning.</i>

41:28.252 --> 41:33.121
You're unmotivated,
careless, selfish, distracted,

41:33.157 --> 41:37.218
and pretty much the people in this
hospital I'd least trust with my life.

41:37.261 --> 41:42.164
But that's the way it's supposed to be.
You're interns. You're babies.

41:42.199 --> 41:46.226
And you're all lucky to work here.
We're all lucky because we save lives.

41:46.270 --> 41:50.832
Every day, we get to save lives.
That's our job, and...

41:51.642 --> 41:55.806
It's not something a lot
of people get to do, so...

41:55.846 --> 41:57.939
- <i>In the hope that...</i>
- Let's begin.

41:57.982 --> 41:59.472
- <i>...maybe...</i>
- New game.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.350
- <i>...someday...</i>
- This is Patient X.

42:02.386 --> 42:05.981
She's a 29-year-old female
we misdiagnosed with anemia

42:06.023 --> 42:08.548
the first time she came to us.

42:09.326 --> 42:11.419
Let's not make the same mistake again.

42:11.462 --> 42:17.128
<i>...we'll come just a little bit closer</i>
<i>to the gods our patients need us to be.</i>
