WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.383
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.521 --> 00:07.283
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.421 --> 00:11.977
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.115 --> 00:14.911
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.049 --> 00:17.810
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.948 --> 00:21.952
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.333 --> 00:26.026
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.164 --> 00:28.718
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.856 --> 00:31.272
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.410 --> 00:34.034
Just to get up that hill

00:34.172 --> 00:36.553
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.691 --> 00:39.142
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.280 --> 00:41.627
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.765 --> 00:43.353
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.491 --> 00:46.149
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.187
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.325 --> 00:53.708
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.846 --> 00:56.573
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.711 --> 00:59.576
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.714 --> 01:04.305
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:12.244 --> 01:15.454
Miss Jefferson!
Miss Jefferson!

01:15.592 --> 01:17.146
Miss Jefferson!
It's in the kitchen!

01:17.284 --> 01:18.595
It's horrible!
It's coming after us!

01:18.733 --> 01:22.358
Oh, Florence, calm down.
What's coming after us?

01:22.496 --> 01:23.738
It's in there! A bug!

01:26.810 --> 01:28.398
Is that all?
A bug?

01:28.536 --> 01:30.297
Not a bug.
A bug!

01:31.643 --> 01:33.955
It's that huge?
Yeah, with six hairy legs

01:34.094 --> 01:35.992
and a spiked shoe
on everyone of them.

01:37.027 --> 01:39.271
Oh, Florence, come on,
I'll get him.

01:39.409 --> 01:43.448
Be careful, Miss Jefferson.
I only seen but one bug
like that before in my life.

01:43.586 --> 01:44.690
Where?
In a movie.

01:44.828 --> 01:46.244
The Bug
That Ate Cleveland.

01:56.599 --> 01:57.841
I don't see it, Florence.

01:57.979 --> 01:59.360
It's in the cupboard.

02:04.814 --> 02:09.301
Oh, Florence.
I saw it. It's terrible.
And it's ugly.

02:09.439 --> 02:11.855
I know what you mean.
That face was something else.

02:15.031 --> 02:17.861
Now, Florence,
we can't stay out of
the kitchen all day.

02:17.999 --> 02:19.691
And we're a lot
bigger than that bug.

02:19.829 --> 02:21.244
So there's only
one thing to do.

02:21.382 --> 02:22.487
What?

02:22.625 --> 02:24.420
You go in there
and kill it.

02:25.490 --> 02:29.149
Hey, Weez.
Oh, George,
am I glad you're home.

02:29.287 --> 02:30.874
You've gotta do
something and quick.

02:31.012 --> 02:33.083
Why? What's the matter?
There's a bug
in the kitchen.

02:33.222 --> 02:35.672
It's just awful.
You gotta kill
him for us.

02:35.810 --> 02:36.984
Is that what you're
all excited about?

02:37.122 --> 02:39.366
About some stupid old bug?

02:42.817 --> 02:44.371
Is it big?

02:48.961 --> 02:51.861
Child, if it had wings,
we could book
passengers on it.

02:54.277 --> 02:55.865
Oh, he's up there.

02:56.003 --> 02:57.556
Okay, stand back.

03:11.605 --> 03:12.985
Gotcha.

03:14.021 --> 03:16.472
He's not in there.
In that one!

03:18.957 --> 03:20.441
Sorry about the plates.

03:24.721 --> 03:26.930
Oh, Weezy, you're
worried about nothing.
The bug is dead.

03:27.793 --> 03:29.968
Well, he was alive
when I saw him.

03:30.106 --> 03:31.556
I wonder what
killed him.

03:31.694 --> 03:33.454
Probably took one
look at you and had
a heart attack.

03:37.803 --> 03:39.771
Well, at least that's over.

03:39.909 --> 03:43.015
You can put away
the groceries, and start
on the ham now, Florence.

03:43.153 --> 03:44.845
Hold it, Florence.
You ain't gotta cook tonight.

03:44.983 --> 03:46.847
I'm taking my favorite
girl out to dinner.

03:46.985 --> 03:48.987
Okay. But you gotta
bring me home by 10:00.

03:50.954 --> 03:52.335
Not you!

03:52.473 --> 03:53.612
Come on, Weezy,
I got another
surprise for you.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.580
You do?

03:55.718 --> 03:57.340
What's the big
occasion, George?

03:57.478 --> 03:59.515
No occasion.
You know how
romantic I am.

04:00.170 --> 04:02.172
Here, this is for you.

04:05.314 --> 04:08.317
Oh, George, it's beautiful.

04:08.455 --> 04:12.286
A white orchid.
Oh, you shouldn't
have done it.

04:12.424 --> 04:14.115
I had to. I couldn't
find a black one.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.156
Sometimes you
can be so sweet.

04:20.294 --> 04:23.539
Well, you know, I figured
we'd have some dinner,
maybe do a little dancing.

04:23.677 --> 04:25.403
Then go to the airport
for some dessert.
Then come home...

04:25.541 --> 04:29.407
Now wait a minute.
Why would we go to
the airport for dessert?

04:29.545 --> 04:30.753
Cause it'll be
fun, Weezy.

04:30.891 --> 04:33.134
Look, millions
of people come to
New York every day.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.895
We might see
somebody we know.

04:35.033 --> 04:36.448
Now come on,
hurry and go
get dressed.

04:36.586 --> 04:38.347
Hold it, George.

04:39.106 --> 04:40.832
Who's coming in tonight?

04:40.970 --> 04:43.386
It's my nephew Raymond
from Chicago.

04:43.524 --> 04:45.423
Oh, your brother
Henry's son?

04:45.561 --> 04:48.046
We haven't seen him
since he was born.

04:48.184 --> 04:49.289
Oh, well how old
is he now?

04:49.427 --> 04:50.600
Eight.

04:50.738 --> 04:53.741
Oh, it'll be nice seeing
Henry and Ruby again.

04:53.879 --> 04:56.157
No, it won't.
What?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.401
They ain't coming.
Just Raymond.

04:58.539 --> 05:00.852
They are sending
that little boy
all by himself?

05:00.990 --> 05:03.475
Look, Weezy, Ruby and Henry
are having a little trouble.

05:03.613 --> 05:06.547
But they know they can solve
the problem if they could
just have some time alone.

05:06.685 --> 05:08.963
So, I told them we'd
take Raymond.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.207
Oh, that's nice, George.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.037
I don't know why
you were hiding it.

05:14.175 --> 05:17.489
Florence, will you fix up
Lionel's room for Raymond?

05:17.627 --> 05:19.940
Thanks, Weez,
I knew you'd understand.

05:20.078 --> 05:22.494
How long is he staying?
Oh, just...

05:28.120 --> 05:30.330
How long?
Only six weeks.
What is...

05:30.951 --> 05:32.746
Six weeks?

05:32.884 --> 05:36.370
You promised we would
take care of a eight year
old for six weeks?

05:36.508 --> 05:39.615
Florence, fix up that
room for George, too.

05:39.753 --> 05:41.651
Oh, come on, Weezy!

05:41.789 --> 05:43.584
He ain't gonna be
that much trouble.

05:43.722 --> 05:45.414
Look at all these toys
I bought for him.

05:46.311 --> 05:48.624
Look at
this dummy.

05:49.452 --> 05:50.833
Which one?

05:54.733 --> 05:58.185
Look, George,
we haven't had a child
in this house for years.

05:58.323 --> 06:01.499
I don't know what appeals
to an eight-year-old mind.

06:01.637 --> 06:04.329
Sure you do. You talk
to Florence all the time.

06:06.607 --> 06:09.679
I'm serious.
Six weeks is a long time.

06:09.817 --> 06:13.200
You work all day.
And I'm the one who
has to take care of him.

06:13.338 --> 06:15.098
Look, Weezy, Raymond
ain't gonna be no trouble.

06:15.236 --> 06:17.377
He'll probably be napping
most of the time anyway.

06:17.515 --> 06:20.000
Eight year olds
do not take naps.

06:20.138 --> 06:22.312
They do if you slip
some booze in their milk.

06:23.935 --> 06:25.143
Oh, George.

06:25.281 --> 06:27.214
Look, Weezy, I'm telling you,
Raymond is family.

06:27.352 --> 06:29.492
I mean, his
great grandfather
was a Jefferson.

06:29.630 --> 06:32.875
His father was a Jefferson.
His uncle is a Jefferson.

06:33.013 --> 06:34.359
So what does that
make him?

06:34.497 --> 06:36.534
Alex Haley?

06:36.672 --> 06:40.434
A Jefferson.
And a Jefferson always
helps another Jefferson.

06:40.572 --> 06:42.747
You'd never do
this for my family.

06:42.885 --> 06:44.265
They're not Jeffersons.

06:46.336 --> 06:48.028
Oh, that poor little kid.

06:48.166 --> 06:51.549
He'll be scared
to death traveling on that
airplane all by himself.

06:52.929 --> 06:54.724
Okay, Miss Jefferson,
the room's all set.

06:54.862 --> 06:57.209
Florence!
There's your
answer, Weezy.

06:57.347 --> 06:59.384
You won't have
to babysit. Florence will.

07:01.662 --> 07:05.459
Now look, I do windows.
I do floors.
I even do ironing.

07:05.597 --> 07:08.082
But I don't
do babysitting.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.739
Look, I don't care
what nobody says.

07:09.877 --> 07:12.604
He's my nephew,
and we are gonna take
care of him.

07:15.055 --> 07:17.160
Hi!
Who are you?

07:17.298 --> 07:19.128
I'm your nephew.

07:19.266 --> 07:21.993
I just wanted to tell you
not to pick me up at the
airport, cause I'm here.

07:23.339 --> 07:25.652
Raymond! You're not
supposed to be here
for another hour.

07:25.790 --> 07:28.102
I took another plane.
My parents dropped
me off early,

07:28.240 --> 07:29.828
so I traded in
my ticket.

07:29.966 --> 07:31.934
All by yourself?

07:32.072 --> 07:35.524
Aunt Louise, you're
even more beautiful
than your pictures.

07:37.077 --> 07:39.286
Oh, not really.

07:39.424 --> 07:41.978
I'll bet you when
she was younger
she was one foxy number.

07:42.116 --> 07:43.566
What?

07:45.844 --> 07:49.676
Hi. Who are you?
Oh, just another
foxy number.

07:49.814 --> 07:52.610
Raymond, this is
Florence, our maid.

07:52.748 --> 07:54.232
Hi.
Hi.

07:54.370 --> 07:57.925
Now, aren't you
gonna give your
Aunt Louise a big kiss?

07:58.063 --> 08:01.170
Hey, I'm eight years old.
I don't kiss unless
it's serious.

08:09.178 --> 08:10.973
How'd you get here
from the airport?

08:11.111 --> 08:13.872
A bus. I tried to
flag down a cab,
but the drivers

08:14.010 --> 08:15.805
don't see you
when you're short.

08:15.943 --> 08:17.842
You must know
what I mean, Uncle George.

08:20.569 --> 08:21.846
What?

08:23.330 --> 08:26.989
What are you laughing at?

08:27.127 --> 08:29.509
I just saw the family
resemblance between
you two.

08:31.476 --> 08:32.753
It's the mouth.

08:35.860 --> 08:37.620
Hello, Florence.
Hello, Mr. Bentley.

08:37.758 --> 08:41.382
Mrs. J. Oh, hello.
Who's the little fellow?

08:41.521 --> 08:43.177
It's my Uncle George.

08:48.907 --> 08:52.428
Mr. Bentley, this is
our nephew Raymond
from Chicago.

08:53.015 --> 08:54.430
Hi.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.019
Is there something
you want, Bentley?

08:57.157 --> 08:59.642
Yes, I need some
advice from Mrs. J.
Oh.

08:59.780 --> 09:03.128
Now, Mrs. J,
you know that French film,
Pardone Mon Affaire.

09:03.266 --> 09:06.511
It's playing at the Orpheum.
I understand it's rather racy.

09:06.649 --> 09:08.824
Do you think it would
be proper for me to take
a young lady there

09:08.962 --> 09:10.066
on our first date?

09:10.826 --> 09:14.001
Well, I don't...
Don't do it.

09:14.139 --> 09:15.589
Not if you don't
know the chick.

09:17.764 --> 09:19.662
Beg your pardon?
Listen...

09:20.663 --> 09:22.009
Excuse me.

09:22.147 --> 09:23.493
Movies are expensive.

09:23.632 --> 09:27.083
Once I got stuck
in a Disney movie
with a real flat tire.

09:27.912 --> 09:29.327
Oh, it's a bad
idea, huh?

09:29.465 --> 09:32.123
The pits. Get a good
look at her first.

09:32.261 --> 09:34.608
If she's okay,
then start spending
your money.

09:34.746 --> 09:36.127
Maybe you'll get lucky.

09:38.370 --> 09:41.719
Thank you.
Any time.

09:41.857 --> 09:47.138
Uh, Raymond,
Mr. Bentley is a translator
at the United Nations.

09:47.276 --> 09:50.382
Isn't that exciting?

09:50.520 --> 09:53.972
Oh, it's not that exciting.
I just translate Russian
insults into English,

09:54.110 --> 09:56.147
and English insults
back into Russian.

09:56.285 --> 09:57.769
Do you like that?

09:57.907 --> 10:00.151
Oh, yes, I love
to see people getting
along together.

10:00.289 --> 10:03.326
Weezy, I just came up
with a great idea.

10:03.464 --> 10:05.018
What are you doing, George?

10:05.156 --> 10:08.366
Look, maybe we can get
Bentley to take the kid
off our hands.

10:09.263 --> 10:10.437
I mean, he could
show him the UN.

10:10.575 --> 10:12.059
That should
take a couple of days.

10:12.197 --> 10:13.820
Hey, Bentley, I got
something to ask you.

10:13.958 --> 10:15.994
Oh, I know what you're
going to say, Mr. J,
you want me to leave.

10:16.132 --> 10:18.479
No, wait, I, uh...
No, no. I know I
drop over a lot,

10:18.618 --> 10:19.964
and I don't want
to overstay my welcome.

10:20.102 --> 10:21.586
No, Bentley, you
don't understand.

10:21.724 --> 10:23.450
But I do understand.
You see, whenever
you get that look,

10:23.588 --> 10:26.280
you always throw me out.
Well, not this time.
I'll do it myself.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.799
No, but see...
I'll even slam the door.

10:27.937 --> 10:29.767
I wasn't...

10:29.905 --> 10:33.287
Oh, that Bentley!
The first time I needed him,
he runs out on me.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.462
You wanted him to take
me off your hands, huh?

10:35.600 --> 10:38.499
No, no, no.
Of course not.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.399
Uh, I'll put your things
away, Raymond.

10:41.537 --> 10:44.160
George, why don't you show
him the toys you bought?

10:44.298 --> 10:46.991
Oh, yeah, we'll
have a lot of fun. Oh.

10:47.129 --> 10:49.856
Okay. Look at this.

10:49.994 --> 10:52.099
A fire engine!

10:52.237 --> 10:53.653
I don't like fire engines!

10:55.240 --> 10:56.517
Well, this one
squirts real water.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.278
That's the worst kind.

10:59.728 --> 11:01.315
I know you'll love this.

11:02.247 --> 11:05.181
A Marshmallow Land game.

11:06.631 --> 11:08.564
When I was your age,
I used to play this
for hours.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.049
You must have really
been retarded.

11:15.916 --> 11:18.056
Are you sure you're
my nephew?

11:18.194 --> 11:21.750
Okay. I forgot
the best gift of all.

11:25.754 --> 11:28.964
Hi. I'm Sparky.
What's your name?

11:29.102 --> 11:30.966
You know my name,
Uncle George.

11:31.104 --> 11:33.209
Yeah, I do!

11:33.347 --> 11:35.004
But Sparky doesn't!

11:35.142 --> 11:37.420
This is the last toy I got,
so tell him your name!

11:41.942 --> 11:43.116
Raymond.

11:43.254 --> 11:45.187
Oh, hi, Raymond.

11:45.325 --> 11:48.811
You and me are gonna
have a lot of fun together
for six weeks, aren't we?

11:48.949 --> 11:50.675
Not unless your
head falls off.

11:52.988 --> 11:55.335
Look, there's got to be
something here that you like.

11:55.473 --> 11:56.923
I spent 50 bucks
on this stuff.

11:57.061 --> 11:59.097
So what? I didn't wanna
come in the first place.

11:59.235 --> 12:01.375
Where do you wanna go?
I'll buy you a ticket.

12:03.481 --> 12:05.103
What's going on out here?

12:05.241 --> 12:06.898
Aunt Louise,
he's yelling at me.

12:07.036 --> 12:09.590
You're damn right!
You could learn
a little respect!

12:09.729 --> 12:11.661
See? He's not
nice, like you.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.422
I'll show you nice!
George!

12:16.390 --> 12:18.565
Raymond, why don't you
go wash your hands?

12:19.497 --> 12:20.878
And we'll go
out to dinner.

12:21.016 --> 12:22.949
Yes, Aunt Louise.

12:26.607 --> 12:28.713
I ain't gonna make it,
Weezy. Not with that kid.

12:28.851 --> 12:31.612
George, give him a chance.
He's just a baby.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.476
Yeah. Rosemary's Baby.

12:36.203 --> 12:38.792
Now listen to me,
George Jefferson.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.760
Raymond is
a sweet little boy.

12:40.898 --> 12:45.523
He's staying with us.
And if there's any trouble,
you'll answer to me.

12:45.661 --> 12:47.283
And you know
what that means.

12:49.630 --> 12:52.806
Yeah, I gotta spend six
weeks with Raymond.

13:09.685 --> 13:11.135
Oh, good morning,
Miss Jefferson.

13:11.273 --> 13:15.656
Morning.
Oh, Florence, I'm
simply exhausted.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.728
George was so restless,
he kept me up
the whole night.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.593
You poor child.
You look like you could
really use a cup of coffee.

13:21.731 --> 13:24.182
Oh, yeah, Florence,
I sure could.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.253
It's right over there
on the stove.

13:30.740 --> 13:33.019
Oh, as long as
you up, I could use
another cup, too.

13:34.710 --> 13:37.540
You just want coffee,
or should I make
you breakfast, too?

13:39.094 --> 13:42.442
My, my, everybody
sure is grouchy
around here lately.

13:42.580 --> 13:46.239
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's been a lousy week.

13:46.377 --> 13:51.278
Raymond is driving George
crazy, and George is
taking it out on me.

13:54.178 --> 13:55.938
Here.

13:56.076 --> 13:57.871
Morning.

13:59.769 --> 14:01.254
Thanks, Weez.

14:02.427 --> 14:04.809
Boy, what I would
give for an hour's sleep.

14:06.190 --> 14:08.606
Did you know
I was tossing
and turning all night?

14:08.744 --> 14:11.195
Who do you think was
bouncing next to you?

14:13.197 --> 14:17.132
I had this nightmare
that I was marooned
on this small desert island,

14:17.270 --> 14:19.065
with nobody to talk to.

14:19.203 --> 14:21.481
Then one day I saw this
speck out in the water.

14:21.619 --> 14:24.277
And it kept coming closer
and closer and closer.

14:24.415 --> 14:27.349
And I ran down to the beach,
and I pulled it out of the
water and turned it over.

14:27.487 --> 14:28.937
And it was Raymond!

14:30.559 --> 14:32.216
Oh, no!

14:32.354 --> 14:34.114
So I threw him back in.

14:36.220 --> 14:38.878
And he kept swimming back.

14:39.016 --> 14:42.019
Then I tried
to run away from him,
and I fell off of a cliff.

14:42.157 --> 14:44.745
I kept falling, and falling,
and falling. Oh...

14:44.884 --> 14:46.644
That must have
been horrible.

14:46.782 --> 14:48.818
No, that was the good
part of the dream.

14:48.957 --> 14:50.165
I landed on Raymond.

14:52.408 --> 14:55.584
Oh, George,
you've gotta get
a hold of yourself.

14:55.722 --> 14:57.379
Well, I can't help it,
Weezy. I feel guilty.

14:57.517 --> 14:59.346
I mean, Raymond's
my nephew.

14:59.484 --> 15:02.315
I'm supposed to
get along with him.
I wanna be his friend.

15:02.453 --> 15:04.041
Well, what's stopping you?

15:04.179 --> 15:05.594
I hate him.

15:06.767 --> 15:09.253
Now remember what
the Bible says, Mr. Jefferson.

15:09.391 --> 15:11.427
The good Lord says
never hate anyone.

15:11.565 --> 15:13.982
The good Lord
never met Raymond.

15:15.811 --> 15:18.814
I just wonder if you've
given him a fair chance.

15:18.952 --> 15:22.128
You know, it takes time
to make friends.

15:22.266 --> 15:25.131
Yeah, maybe
you're right, Weezy.
Maybe it is my fault.

15:26.546 --> 15:28.168
Okay, I got it.

15:28.306 --> 15:30.067
I'm gonna take the rest
of the day off
and spend it with Raymond.

15:30.205 --> 15:31.723
Just him and me,
making friends.

15:31.861 --> 15:34.347
Thank you, Weezy.
It's a great idea
you came up with.

15:34.485 --> 15:36.936
Oh, George.

15:37.074 --> 15:39.421
And it only took you
25 years.

15:43.390 --> 15:45.979
Hey, Raymond!
How's my old buddy?

15:46.117 --> 15:47.291
Okay, I guess.

15:47.429 --> 15:49.189
You having
a good time here?
Yeah.

15:49.327 --> 15:50.950
Are you having
a great time here?

15:51.088 --> 15:52.986
Well, let's not get crazy.

15:56.058 --> 15:58.060
Okay, you're gonna start
having a great time,

15:58.198 --> 16:02.582
because you and me
are gonna spend
the whole day together!

16:02.720 --> 16:04.825
Doing what?
Anything we want.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.551
Hey, I got a game.

16:07.828 --> 16:09.106
You ever play
this game?

16:09.244 --> 16:12.178
You hold out
your hands like this.
I put my hands on top.

16:12.316 --> 16:13.938
Now you try to hit
my hands before I can
pull them away...

16:14.076 --> 16:15.560
Like this?
Okay... Yeah.

16:17.838 --> 16:19.357
Okay.

16:20.151 --> 16:21.635
I'm ready, go.

16:21.773 --> 16:25.018
Hey! All right,
hold it, hold it.
Stop, stop!

16:25.156 --> 16:27.641
That's a crummy game.
I kind of like it.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.230
What do you say
we go out?
Today is yours.

16:30.368 --> 16:32.577
Anything you wanna
do, I wanna do.

16:32.715 --> 16:34.821
Anything in the world.
Just name it.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.996
Horseback riding.
Except for horseback riding.

16:37.134 --> 16:39.101
Why?
Look, this is New York.

16:39.239 --> 16:40.654
There's a lot
of things to do.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.450
Hey, how would you
like to take a ride
on the subway?

16:43.588 --> 16:46.108
Only if it goes
to the horses.

16:46.246 --> 16:48.145
Look, forget
about the horses.

16:48.283 --> 16:51.631
Hey, I got it. The zoo!
You'll love the zoo.
Wanna bet?

16:52.873 --> 16:54.427
The Statue of Liberty.

16:54.565 --> 16:55.980
That's for tourists.

16:56.118 --> 16:58.017
Times Square.
That's for weirdos!

16:58.845 --> 17:01.503
Ah-ha!
The Empire State Building!

17:01.641 --> 17:04.471
One hundred and
two stories. We'll go all
the way to the top.

17:04.609 --> 17:07.750
I can't. If I go
up too high I get
a bloody nose.

17:07.888 --> 17:10.236
You might get
one anyway.
What?

17:10.374 --> 17:13.101
Nothing. We'll do
what you wanna do.

17:13.239 --> 17:15.206
Horseback riding?
Yeah.

17:15.344 --> 17:17.001
Fantastic.

17:17.139 --> 17:19.831
Yep. And we'll have
nothing but fun, fun, fun.

17:26.597 --> 17:28.564
Oh, Raymond and Mr. Jefferson
are still out, huh?

17:28.702 --> 17:31.947
Yeah, isn't it wonderful?
They must really be
hitting it off.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.259
Yeah.

17:33.397 --> 17:36.538
Weezy! Florence!
Where is everybody?

17:36.676 --> 17:38.126
George, here we are.
What is it?

17:38.264 --> 17:39.817
Is he here?
Is he here?

17:39.955 --> 17:41.853
Who?
Raymond! He's missing!

17:41.991 --> 17:43.234
What do you
mean, missing?

17:43.372 --> 17:45.305
Look, when I left he
was with me, now he ain't.

17:45.443 --> 17:46.479
What do you call it?

17:46.617 --> 17:48.584
Oh, my God, he's missing!

17:49.792 --> 17:51.449
Wait a minute, don't panic.

17:51.587 --> 17:53.244
Now how did it happen?
I don't know.

17:53.382 --> 17:55.074
We went horseback
riding first.

17:55.212 --> 17:57.973
Horseback riding?
George, you've never ridden
a horse in your life.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.424
And I still haven't.
I fell off the damn
thing three times.

18:03.530 --> 18:05.463
But where did you
lose Raymond?

18:05.601 --> 18:08.156
In Grand Central Station.
I took him there
to show him the trains.

18:08.294 --> 18:09.916
I turned around,
he was gone.

18:10.054 --> 18:12.436
I've been running
my tail off for two hours
trying to find him.

18:12.574 --> 18:14.610
Oh, that poor little boy.

18:14.748 --> 18:16.957
Roaming the streets of
New York all by himself.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.443
Oh, I'm scared, Weezy.
I should have kept
my eye on him.

18:19.581 --> 18:20.961
Anything could happen
to him out there.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.860
Well, we've gotta
do something.

18:22.998 --> 18:24.758
What am I gonna tell
my brother Henry?

18:24.896 --> 18:27.761
Now calm down, Mr. Jefferson.
I had an uncle who
got lost once,

18:27.899 --> 18:30.523
right over on Lenox.
And boy, was we worried.

18:30.661 --> 18:32.076
But he came back.
Oh, yeah?

18:32.214 --> 18:33.560
Of course, it was
six years later.

18:35.493 --> 18:37.771
You know, you are
a big help. Why don't
you do something useful?

18:37.909 --> 18:40.740
Like what?
Like going in the kitchen
and defrost your brains.

18:42.535 --> 18:45.883
George, we just
can't stand here.
We've gotta call the police.

18:46.021 --> 18:47.609
Oh, yeah,
you're right, Weezy.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.131
Hello?
Oh, hi, Henry.

18:52.269 --> 18:53.787
It's my brother!

18:53.925 --> 18:56.238
Oh, yeah.
Oh, how's the family doing?

18:56.376 --> 18:58.689
Oh, good. Oh, yeah,
everybody's fine here, too.

18:58.827 --> 19:01.554
Okay,
I'll be talking to you again
soon sometime, okay?

19:01.692 --> 19:03.452
Right. Bye.
Huh?

19:03.590 --> 19:06.731
Raymond?
Oh, oh, yeah, he's fine.

19:06.869 --> 19:08.940
Hold on a second. Here.
Oh, no...

19:09.078 --> 19:10.770
Just take it.

19:10.908 --> 19:13.324
He wants to talk to me?
No, he wants to
talk to Raymond.

19:14.739 --> 19:16.914
Why you little...

19:17.052 --> 19:19.054
Well, hello, Henry.

19:19.744 --> 19:21.470
No, this is Louise.

19:21.608 --> 19:26.820
Raymond?
Oh, uh, he's, uh, outside
playing in the street.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.305
We just don't know
which street.

19:30.030 --> 19:31.653
Sure, I'll tell him
you called.

19:31.791 --> 19:33.689
Okay. Bye.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.726
Now look, George...

19:35.864 --> 19:38.556
I know, Weezy,
it's all my fault.

19:38.694 --> 19:41.110
If anything happens
to that kid, I don't know
what I'll do.

19:41.249 --> 19:43.078
Miss Jefferson,
you call the police.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.287
Come on, Mr. Jefferson,
you and me will go out
and find him.

19:45.425 --> 19:47.047
Okay. I don't know
where to start.

19:50.775 --> 19:52.052
Why don't you
start in the hall?

19:52.432 --> 19:53.985
What?

19:54.123 --> 19:55.987
Raymond, are you
all right?

19:56.125 --> 19:57.299
Yeah, sure.

19:57.437 --> 20:00.475
You're not hurt
or anything, are you?
I'm fine.

20:00.613 --> 20:03.271
Well now that
Mini Mouth is back,
I'm gonna go lay down.

20:08.379 --> 20:11.486
Boy, you don't know
what I went through.
Being lost is scary.

20:11.624 --> 20:13.729
Were you lost,
Uncle George?

20:13.867 --> 20:16.007
No, you were.
No, I wasn't.

20:16.145 --> 20:18.113
Well now I'm lost.
Where were you?

20:18.251 --> 20:19.701
Just out walking around.

20:19.839 --> 20:22.393
I got tired of looking
at the trains, so I left.

20:22.531 --> 20:24.982
Without telling me?
I don't have to tell
you everything.

20:27.053 --> 20:29.952
Oh, yes, you do.
We're responsible for you.

20:30.090 --> 20:31.160
So what?

20:31.299 --> 20:33.749
Oh, you ain't getting
away with it this time.

20:33.887 --> 20:37.305
Hey, it's nothing to get
uptight about. I'm smart.
I can handle myself.

20:37.443 --> 20:38.823
I've got it here.

20:38.961 --> 20:41.170
Oh, yeah? And now you're
gonna get it down there.

20:41.861 --> 20:43.242
Hey, what are you doing?

20:43.380 --> 20:44.484
You're so smart,
figure it out.

20:44.622 --> 20:47.246
Aunt Louise, help!
He's gonna spank me!

20:47.384 --> 20:49.869
Oh, in your own words,
Raymond, so what?

20:50.007 --> 20:52.078
Come here, Raymond.

20:52.216 --> 20:54.770
Hey, we're reasonable men.
Let's talk this over.

20:54.908 --> 20:57.497
Come here.
Can I call my
lawyer first?

20:57.635 --> 20:59.050
Come here!

20:59.188 --> 21:02.191
Okay. The more you run
the worse it's gonna be
when I catch you.

21:02.330 --> 21:03.676
Come here!

21:09.647 --> 21:12.581
Okay, I got you.
Now you're gonna get it.

21:12.719 --> 21:15.895
But, Uncle George, how can
you hit your own nephew?

21:16.033 --> 21:18.725
Like this.
Your own brother's son?

21:23.247 --> 21:24.766
Go on, get out of here.

21:32.498 --> 21:34.085
Oh, George.

21:41.817 --> 21:43.992
Aunt Louise, can you
reach that carton of milk?

21:44.130 --> 21:47.167
Sure. Here.
Thanks.

21:52.276 --> 21:55.348
You think your Uncle George
is pretty dumb, don't you?

21:55.486 --> 21:57.557
You get away with
everything around here.

21:57.695 --> 21:58.834
Well...

21:58.972 --> 22:02.666
Well, of course,
that's because you
are so smart.

22:02.804 --> 22:05.324
In fact, you're so smart,
you're stupid.

22:06.048 --> 22:07.464
Huh?

22:09.086 --> 22:10.777
Do you know what
you are, Raymond?

22:10.915 --> 22:12.538
You are one big...

22:14.505 --> 22:18.164
I can't even say it.
But you're the biggest one
I've ever seen.

22:19.476 --> 22:22.306
Don't scold, Aunt Louise.
I'm just a little boy.

22:26.414 --> 22:28.277
Save it, Raymond.

22:28.416 --> 22:30.728
We'll use it to fertilize
the tomatoes.

22:31.867 --> 22:33.455
What are you
so mad about?

22:34.732 --> 22:37.356
Can't you see how much
your Uncle George loves you?

22:39.150 --> 22:41.394
That's why he
took you out today.

22:41.532 --> 22:44.846
That's why he was
so worried when
you were missing.

22:44.984 --> 22:46.468
That's why he
couldn't spank you.

22:46.606 --> 22:48.297
You know, you are right.

22:48.436 --> 22:50.990
He is dumb for caring
about you.

22:51.128 --> 22:53.095
I just wanted to
have a little fun.

22:54.752 --> 22:57.893
Without caring about
your Uncle George.

22:58.031 --> 23:01.103
You won't find many people
who love you like he does.

23:01.241 --> 23:03.796
I wouldn't cut
down on the number.

23:07.213 --> 23:08.801
Weezy, is there any
beer left in there?

23:17.844 --> 23:22.228
Uncle George,
I really liked the
horseback riding.

23:22.366 --> 23:24.057
Any cold cuts to go
with the beer?

23:24.920 --> 23:26.681
And the trains were okay.

23:29.753 --> 23:31.686
Uncle George,
I'm sorry.

23:31.824 --> 23:33.239
I didn't mean to hurt you.

23:35.759 --> 23:37.277
What was that?

23:37.416 --> 23:40.315
He said he's sorry, George.

23:40.453 --> 23:43.525
What do you say
we forget this week
and start over again?

23:43.663 --> 23:45.078
Well, that's
okay with me.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.459
And I know how, too.

23:46.597 --> 23:48.772
I'm gonna take you out
and buy you an ice cream.

23:50.394 --> 23:52.258
You're gonna treat me?

23:52.396 --> 23:55.744
Yeah, sure.
I found this great place
when you were...

23:55.882 --> 23:57.919
I mean, when I was lost.

23:58.057 --> 24:01.957
Hey, well in that case,
I'll take tomorrow
off from work, too.

24:02.095 --> 24:05.098
And we'll go see
the Statue of Liberty,
and Times Square,

24:05.236 --> 24:06.652
and the Empire
State Building, and...

24:06.790 --> 24:08.343
Uncle George?
What?

24:08.481 --> 24:10.000
Let's not get crazy.

24:12.036 --> 24:13.452
Oh...

24:35.715 --> 24:39.374
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
