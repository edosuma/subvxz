WEBVTT

00:05.672 --> 00:07.333
What is Holland?

00:11.444 --> 00:14.880
What do you mean, what is it?
It's a country right next to Belgium.

00:15.048 --> 00:16.242
No, that's the Netherlands.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.281
Holland is the Netherlands.

00:18.718 --> 00:20.549
Then who are the Dutch?

00:21.354 --> 00:23.584
You know,
I cannot stand this thing anymore.

00:24.124 --> 00:27.651
I know, I hate it too.
I feel like an out-of-work porn star.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.296
We should have taken
some kind of vacation.

00:31.464 --> 00:34.024
-Well, why didn't we?
-You said this would be better.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.224
Remember?

00:35.402 --> 00:36.767
"A vacation from ourselves."

00:36.936 --> 00:38.733
That's what you said.

00:39.606 --> 00:41.039
What if we grew mutton chops?

00:41.207 --> 00:42.674
-No.
-Buzz cuts?

00:42.842 --> 00:45.037
-Parachute pants?
-Stop it, George. Stop it.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.235
I'm sorry.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.040
You've gotta get a job.

00:50.450 --> 00:51.439
Damn it.

00:57.657 --> 00:59.249
Hey, hey, hey.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.859
Check me out.

01:01.027 --> 01:02.790
No more crutches.
That must be a relief.

01:02.962 --> 01:05.294
Yeah. With crutches,
everyone has questions.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.990
-Not with a cane?
-No, with crutches, it's a funny story.

01:08.168 --> 01:11.399
With a cane, it's a sad story.
You through with those?

01:11.905 --> 01:14.066
That is a sad story.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.800
You should've been here.
Some guy from NBC saw my set...

01:16.976 --> 01:18.409
...he wants me to do a showcase.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.239
I might have another shot at a pilot.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.246
All right. We're back in.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.111
We? No.

01:25.285 --> 01:27.185
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kenny Bania.

01:27.353 --> 01:29.753
Thank you. Thank you.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.857
Hey, Jerry, did you see me
up there?

01:32.025 --> 01:34.459
I was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.

01:34.627 --> 01:36.652
-Killed?
-Killed.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.222
I'm gonna go pick up some chicks.

01:39.566 --> 01:41.158
Good-looking ones too.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.766
Hey, what's your name?

01:44.737 --> 01:46.034
Yeah, he killed.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.697
Because I killed first
and warmed up the crowd.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.366
He's like that fish
that attaches himself to the shark.

01:51.544 --> 01:53.512
-And you're the shark?
-Yeah. I'm the shark.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.274
And he's the fish eating my laughs.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.644
I don't know how a fish
could eat laughs.

01:58.818 --> 02:00.683
Well, I'm glad I brought it up.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.027
You got any shredded coconut?

02:10.196 --> 02:11.857
We're not doing that anymore.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.667
-Oh, my God.
-What?

02:17.837 --> 02:19.304
I got a job interview.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.337
They wanna see me this afternoon.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.306
-So, what's this job?
-Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.071
-Knicks? Rangers?
-Playground equipment.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.509
Welcome back to the show.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.520
-Yeah, this is better.
-Yeah.

02:35.688 --> 02:37.349
-So you got any shredded coconut?
-No.

02:37.524 --> 02:39.185
I gotta hobble.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.034 --> 02:51.026
I gotta switch shaving creams.
I'm getting no protection.

02:51.204 --> 02:53.263
-What kind do you use?
-Whatever you get.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.403
Look. Post card from Elaine
from Europe.

02:57.877 --> 03:00.539
Don't tell me she's dragging
another poor guy across Europe.

03:00.713 --> 03:01.771
Remember David Puddy?

03:01.948 --> 03:05.611
Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic.
So she's dating him again, huh?

03:05.785 --> 03:09.312
Well, I guess she's batted around
and she's back at the top of the order.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.086
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine.

03:13.259 --> 03:16.057
That guy's coming home
in a body bag.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.302
Well, let's see, I've got a 10 kroner,
a 5 kroner...

03:23.469 --> 03:26.370
...a 20 kroner. No, wait.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.934
That's another 10 kroner.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.103
<i>Femti</i> kroner.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.438
How much is that?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.203
We have to break up.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.713
-What?
-I can't take this anymore.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.945
I don't wanna hear how interesting
the change with the hole in it is.

03:43.289 --> 03:46.656
And tell me what time it is in New York,
you are going home in a body bag.

03:46.826 --> 03:50.557
Well, what do you think the Gap
in Rome has that's not on Broadway?

03:50.730 --> 03:51.788
Okay, all right, listen.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.956
Forget about the Gap
because we are through.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.395
-Fine.
-Fine.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.059
Okay, Terminal 3. Have a nice flight.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.207
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our flight time with stopovers...<i></i></i>

04:02.375 --> 04:05.242
<i>...will be approximately 22 hours.</i>

04:07.313 --> 04:11.249
Hey. You gonna bust out
that drink cart or what?

04:14.721 --> 04:15.983
Hey, what are you doing?

04:16.154 --> 04:19.351
Taking this lace out. It came undone,
touched the floor of a men's room.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.685
That's the end of that.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.157
Did you see Bania's set last night?

04:24.330 --> 04:26.025
I read on the Internet he killed.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.322
He killed.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.560
He only does well
when he has me for a lead-in.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.136
He's a time-slot hit.

04:32.305 --> 04:35.001
Jerry, you gotta give him
some credit.

04:35.174 --> 04:37.472
I mean, you're just being
totally ridiculous.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.775
I'll see you later, buddy.

04:42.815 --> 04:47.013
-Wait, wait, wait a minute.
-What? What? What?

04:47.186 --> 04:49.654
Do I have to ask?

04:50.890 --> 04:54.382
Well, I ran out of butter,
so I had to borrow yours.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.495
Anything else, Mr. Nosy?

05:00.633 --> 05:03.363
Why are you buttering your face?

05:03.536 --> 05:05.026
I'm shaving with it.

05:05.204 --> 05:07.468
Oh, Moses, smell the roses.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.167
Look, Jerry, it's vastly superior
to any commercial shaving cream.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.039
I mean, the shave
is close and clean...

05:13.212 --> 05:16.477
...and the natural emollients
keep my skin silky smooth.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.638
-Feel my face.
-No.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.751
-No, feel it.
-I don't want to.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.251
Feel it.

05:22.422 --> 05:23.548
That is close.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.358
I got the job?

05:32.532 --> 05:35.592
George, everybody here at Play Now
is just very impressed with you...

05:35.768 --> 05:37.736
...but I'm sure you've heard
that before.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.661
Well...

05:40.273 --> 05:42.173
...no.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.742
Don't think anyone's
gonna treat you differently...

05:44.911 --> 05:46.845
...just because of your....

05:47.013 --> 05:48.241
Handicap.

05:48.414 --> 05:51.042
Handicap?
Oh, I'm not handicapped.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.206
I'm sorry.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.778
Differently....

05:55.455 --> 05:56.513
Advantaged.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.917
See, I didn't mean that.

05:58.091 --> 06:02.425
Of course, you will have your own
private, fully-equipped bathroom.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.762
When do I start?

06:08.935 --> 06:11.199
Well, whenever you feel
that you're able.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.239
You need a hand here?

06:15.608 --> 06:17.337
Yeah, what the hell.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.781
-You got the job?
-Jerry, it's fantastic.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.780
I love the people.
They treat me so great.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.282
They think I'm handicapped.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.886
They gave me this incredible office,
a great view.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.387
-They think you're handicapped?
-Yeah, yeah.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.717
Yeah, because of the cane.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.292
You should see the bathroom
they gave me.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.088
How can you do this?

06:37.797 --> 06:40.061
Jerry, let's face it.
I've always been handicapped.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.326
I'm just now getting
the recognition for it.

06:43.770 --> 06:47.069
Name one thing I have that puts me
in a position of advantage.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.674
There was a guy that worked
at the Yankees, no arms.

06:49.842 --> 06:52.333
He got more work done than I did.
Made more money.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.412
He had a wife, a family.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.070
Drove a better car than I did.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.809
He drove a car with no arms?

06:59.419 --> 07:02.354
All right, I made up the part
about the car, but the rest is true.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.490
And he hated me anyway.

07:04.657 --> 07:08.115
Do you know how hard it's getting
just to tell people I know you?

07:08.294 --> 07:09.761
I love that bathroom.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.123
It's got that high toilet.

07:11.297 --> 07:14.698
I feel like a gargoyle perched
on the ledge of a building.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.266
Hey. They hooked me up.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.769
What's with all the butter?

07:19.939 --> 07:21.804
I'm shaving with it.
And you know what?

07:21.974 --> 07:22.963
You can eat it?

07:23.543 --> 07:24.532
No.

07:24.710 --> 07:27.611
My face feels so good,
I'm gonna use it all over my body.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.349
Oh, my God. It's Bania and Jenna.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.510
-Who?
-The toothbrush in the toilet bowl.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.255
Hey, Jerry.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.482
This is Jenna.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.183
Pretty good-looking, huh?

07:42.795 --> 07:45.889
Jerry is the guy
that I dated right before you.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.157
This is awkward.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.160
Don't worry, Kenny.

07:49.335 --> 07:52.031
After dating Jerry,
you're a pleasure.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.698
-I don't believe this.
-You miss her, don't you?

07:56.876 --> 08:00.710
No. He's riding my coattails again.
He's getting everything off of me.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.814
First laughs. Now ladies.

08:02.982 --> 08:03.971
You miss her.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.882
You know, I think, ultimately,
I'm upset with myself.

08:12.058 --> 08:15.892
I knew what I was getting into.
She's a bitter, unstable person.

08:16.629 --> 08:17.960
I mean, the sex was good.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.564
Which I'm sure was fine for her...

08:20.733 --> 08:21.722
...but I need more.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.528
Hey, you believing this?

08:24.704 --> 08:26.899
Excuse me, I was sleeping.

08:27.073 --> 08:30.668
Well, you missed
quite a performance.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.037
That's my apple juice.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.089
Someone's cooking.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.116
Hello, Jerry.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.957
Hello, Newman.

09:24.463 --> 09:26.397
You know, old friend...

09:26.566 --> 09:30.400
...sometimes I ponder this silly
gulf between us...

09:30.570 --> 09:32.697
...and I say, why?

09:32.905 --> 09:34.668
Are we really so different?

09:34.840 --> 09:37.308
-For what is broth--
-I'm not the one doing the cooking.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.040
Damn you, Seinfeld.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.644
You useless pustule.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.111
Somebody's got something
on the griddle. Maybe it's Kramer.

09:47.286 --> 09:50.517
No, he's up on the roof
getting some sun with the butter.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.325
Oh, no.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.318
Butter?

09:57.129 --> 09:59.324
This is the <i>femti</i> kroner.

09:59.765 --> 10:04.202
You know, my last boyfriend, he had
a real kroner comprehension problem.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.626
You know what I mean?

10:05.805 --> 10:07.898
A real cement head.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.675
-David, you are so funny.
-Yeah, I know.

10:12.712 --> 10:13.701
What are you doing?

10:13.879 --> 10:16.313
It's a long flight.
I had to get on with my life.

10:16.482 --> 10:18.882
By making time with some floozy
across the aisle?

10:19.051 --> 10:20.143
Yeah, that's right.

10:20.319 --> 10:22.287
What's going on over there
with you and...

10:22.455 --> 10:23.786
...Vegetable Lasagna?

10:23.956 --> 10:26.754
This guy? Oh, he's an idiot.
He doesn't mean anything to me.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.791
I can hear you.

10:29.695 --> 10:32.687
She doesn't either. If it were up to me,
we'd still be together.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.730
-Well, maybe I feel the same way.
-Okay.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.130
-Okay. So now what?
-Let's make out.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.329
-Kramer.
-What?

10:42.208 --> 10:43.539
Oh, man.

10:43.943 --> 10:46.377
I think I cooked myself.

10:46.545 --> 10:47.910
Look at your skin.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.413
Oh, stick a fork in me, Jerry.

10:51.617 --> 10:53.551
I'm done.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.364
I'm fried.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.933
Technically, you're sautéed.
So, what are you doing for that?

11:10.102 --> 11:12.696
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist
so I don't dry out.

11:12.872 --> 11:17.571
-Is that what the doctor said?
-No, I read an article in <i>Bon Appétit.</i>

11:17.743 --> 11:19.142
-See you.
-See you.

11:19.311 --> 11:21.040
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hey, buddy.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.607
-Game hen?
-Kind of.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.245
Nice limp. You bringing
your work home with you?

11:28.421 --> 11:30.355
No, I fake limp on my right.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.253
This is a real limp
because I sprained my ankle.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.586
What happened?

11:34.760 --> 11:38.059
Well, I was buttering myself up
for a nice shave.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.130
Oh, not you too.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.961
I must have dripped some on the floor
and I slipped and--

11:43.135 --> 11:45.569
You know what's good for that?
Relish.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.097
Hello?

11:50.276 --> 11:51.903
Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

11:52.078 --> 11:53.238
What?

11:53.412 --> 11:54.470
No.

11:54.647 --> 11:55.636
No.

11:55.815 --> 11:58.079
No, no, no!

11:58.250 --> 11:59.239
Thank you.

12:00.352 --> 12:01.341
I don't believe this.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.887
They've added Bania to the showcase
and he's going on right after me.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.389
Well, so what?
He's got a couple of good jokes.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.289
Oh, like what? Ovaltine?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.896
Why do dogs drink out of the toilet?

12:12.064 --> 12:14.555
Shopping carts with one bad wheel?

12:15.267 --> 12:17.827
That's true.
That always happens to me.

12:18.437 --> 12:19.768
You think that's funny?

12:19.939 --> 12:22.772
I don't know. I like stuff you don't have
to think about much.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.307
You like Bania's act.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.104
You're a closet Bania fan.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.940
-Maybe I am.
-Oh, I'm gonna puke.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.913
Puke? That's a funny word. Puke.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.851
Puke.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.613
You don't have to think about that.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.626
I can't believe we broke up like that.

12:42.795 --> 12:45.059
It was stupid.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.705
-You want something to read?
-No, I'm good.

13:05.251 --> 13:08.311
-Well, are you gonna take a nap or...?
-No.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.114
You're just gonna sit there
staring at the back of the seat?

13:13.292 --> 13:14.987
Yeah.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.838
That's it. I cannot take this.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.908
I mean, look at this.
Nothing has changed.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.509
We've been together two hours...

13:32.678 --> 13:35.169
...we're having the same problems
we had 12 hours ago.

13:35.347 --> 13:38.009
Oh, tell me about it.
I don't know why I ever took you back.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.118
Oh, please. I took you back.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.949
You know it. I know it.
Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.523
Please, please.
I don't want to get involved.

13:47.092 --> 13:50.926
I hope a giant mountain rises out of
the ocean and we ram right into it...

13:51.096 --> 13:52.529
...and end this whole thing.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.325
Oh, God.

14:06.278 --> 14:08.405
How much longer you gonna be?
I'm starving here.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.276
Just a few more squirts...

14:10.449 --> 14:12.440
...because I gotta stay juicy.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.711
That smell.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.685
-It's still with you, huh?
-Oh, yeah, it's baked on in.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.222
Put another stick of butter in.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.120
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Would you?

14:21.293 --> 14:24.660
Yeah. Stir it up so it'll melt.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.230
Oh, yeah.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.691
That feels good.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.235
Yeah, now I'm simmering.

14:37.576 --> 14:40.443
I'll meet you at the coffee shop.

14:41.113 --> 14:43.479
-Good morning, George.
-Good morning, sir.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.674
Is there something wrong
with your other leg?

14:45.851 --> 14:48.376
What? No, no.
Just the old handicap acting up.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.455
But your cane's on the wrong side.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.182
Oh, well. That's--

14:53.392 --> 14:56.327
That's just because we're standing
on opposite sides.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.029
Yeah, see, when we met...

14:59.198 --> 15:01.428
...I was over there
and you were over here...

15:01.600 --> 15:06.003
...so the image was reversed.
Like in a mirror. You see?

15:07.273 --> 15:10.436
See, this looks right to you,
doesn't it?

15:10.976 --> 15:12.204
Yeah, I guess.

15:12.378 --> 15:14.175
But, see, here.

15:14.346 --> 15:15.711
Right.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.075
Wrong.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.648
Right.

15:18.817 --> 15:20.375
Wrong. Right.

15:20.552 --> 15:24.511
-Right. Wrong.
-Will you stop it, George? Just stop it.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.659
I think I can see
what's going on here.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.932
Well, you're not gonna believe
what happened.

15:47.079 --> 15:48.603
You mugged Steven Hawking?

15:50.049 --> 15:52.950
Play Now thinks
I got problems in both legs.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.484
My own personal Rascal, Jerry.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.485
On the house.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.617
It must comforting to know
you'll be going to hell...

16:03.796 --> 16:05.627
...at no more
than three miles an hour.

16:08.267 --> 16:09.359
-Hello?
-Jerry.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.196
Hey, Laney. How's the trip going?

16:11.370 --> 16:12.359
<i>Oh, it's awful.</i>

16:12.805 --> 16:15.899
This trip was a huge mistake.

16:16.075 --> 16:17.064
Huge.

16:17.242 --> 16:20.871
-Please stop shouting. I can't take it.
-Who's that?

16:21.046 --> 16:23.241
-It's Vegetable Lasagna.
-<i>Who?</i>

16:23.415 --> 16:25.383
Vegetable Lasagna.

16:25.551 --> 16:26.916
My name is Magnus.

16:27.086 --> 16:30.021
<i>Shut up or I'll snap you in half
and stuff you in the overhead.</i>

16:30.189 --> 16:33.056
Get me some duty-free Kahlúa.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.983
-How was the trip?
-Sounded good.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.992
Well, gotta motor.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.223
If you got juice left, you might
wanna roll by the showcase tonight.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.825
You're still going on in front
of Bania, huh?

16:44.003 --> 16:47.370
That's right. And I'll tell you what,
I'm feeling a little off.

16:47.539 --> 16:48.836
What are you talking about?

16:50.542 --> 16:52.373
-You're not.
-That's right.

16:52.544 --> 16:53.704
I'm taking a dive.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.870
-You're throwing the set?
-I'm laying down.

16:56.048 --> 17:00.644
Then we'll see how he does, up there,
without all the assistance.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.746
Listen, Jerry, with all due respect...

17:03.922 --> 17:06.652
...Bania's voice is the voice
of a new generation.

17:06.825 --> 17:08.053
My generation.

17:08.227 --> 17:11.025
-We're four months apart.
-Nevertheless.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.228
His time has come.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.865
Now, if you will kindly help me
unwedge my front wheel...

17:19.038 --> 17:20.198
...I'll be on my way.

17:29.348 --> 17:30.576
Butter.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.182
Kramer.

17:32.651 --> 17:35.381
Butter. Kramer.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.854
Hey, buddy.

17:51.336 --> 17:52.735
Jerry, what are you doing?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.430
George tells me
you're gonna throw your set?

17:55.607 --> 17:56.938
That's right, Choochie.

17:57.109 --> 17:59.441
Let's see how Bania
does without the cushy time slot.

17:59.611 --> 18:02.079
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jerry Seinfeld.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.646
You'll excuse me.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.716
Whoa, man.

18:08.954 --> 18:12.014
Hey, everybody,
who's ready to laugh?

18:13.792 --> 18:16.693
And what's the deal
with lamp shades?

18:16.862 --> 18:18.454
I mean, if it's a lamp...

18:18.630 --> 18:20.120
...why do you want shade?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.968
And what's with people getting sick?

18:26.138 --> 18:27.765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.775
I mean, what's the deal with cancer?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.376
I have cancer.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.675
Tough crowd.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.809
Hey. Hey.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.280
You dented my ride.

18:45.357 --> 18:48.520
What you got there, the four volt?

18:48.961 --> 18:49.985
I did you a favor.

18:50.162 --> 18:52.824
How about I do you a favor
upside your head?

18:54.466 --> 18:57.128
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.970
Hey.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.542
Get the bikes.

19:09.681 --> 19:11.444
Ouch.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.244
Well, that wasn't so bad.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.414
What are you talking about?
I bombed.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.384
No, you had some good stuff.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.046
The cancer bit.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.151
It was edgy. It was not my thing.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.192
But some of those people,
they liked it.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.196
-Like who?
-Well, that guy who yelled out.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.833
He had cancer.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.526
And laughter is the best medicine.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.033
Hey, sorry, Kenny.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.935
Guess you got your work
cut out for you.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.576
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kenny Bania.

19:40.546 --> 19:41.535
Where were you?

19:41.713 --> 19:43.374
Jerry, he could have used your laugh.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.278
He was a big turkey up there.

19:45.450 --> 19:46.542
Turkey?

19:46.718 --> 19:48.913
A big, fat turkey.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.554
I'm sorry I missed that.

19:51.957 --> 19:54.482
I'll tell you, he worked so hard
and then he just blows--

19:56.428 --> 19:57.895
What is this? Oregano?

20:02.401 --> 20:03.390
Look at me.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.833
I'm all covered
in oregano and parmesan...

20:06.004 --> 20:08.097
...and it's sticking
because of the butter.

20:10.075 --> 20:11.235
Look at me.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.072
Hold this.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.310
What is this? Parsley?

20:20.118 --> 20:22.313
The sweet stench of failure.

20:22.487 --> 20:25.718
He bit me. Get off of me.

20:26.191 --> 20:27.624
Get off me.

20:39.838 --> 20:41.533
Come on.

20:42.507 --> 20:45.499
That stupid two-hour battery.

20:45.877 --> 20:47.242
Now I've got you.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.843
George?

20:54.353 --> 20:55.684
Your legs.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.950
Are you a religious man, sir?

21:02.127 --> 21:03.321
No.

21:06.665 --> 21:08.189
-Eat hickory.
-No.

21:11.870 --> 21:13.633
Hey, Jerry. Did you see it?

21:13.805 --> 21:15.602
Ouch.

21:16.408 --> 21:18.342
Kenny, there you are.

21:18.510 --> 21:21.445
Jay Chermack
and Stu Crespi from NBC.

21:21.613 --> 21:25.014
-Listen, Kenny, really funny out there.
-What?

21:25.183 --> 21:27.413
That thing you did,
the two guys running through?

21:27.586 --> 21:29.645
I love stuff
you don't have to think about.

21:30.656 --> 21:31.645
Give us a call.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.553
We wanna be
in the Kenny Bania business.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.853
By the way, Jerry,
the suspenders...

21:37.029 --> 21:38.462
...a little hackey.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.925
How about that, Jerry?

21:42.100 --> 21:44.625
First you had a pilot on NBC
and now I'll have one.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.566
Looks like I'm following you again.

21:46.738 --> 21:48.330
Oh, I'm gonna puke.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.475
Puke? That's a funny word.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.704
Can I use that?

22:03.822 --> 22:05.881
This has been the worst month
of my life...

22:06.058 --> 22:08.288
...and if I never see you again
it'll be too soon.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.449
Ditto.

22:09.628 --> 22:12.290
-Oh, that's original.
-Go to hell.

22:15.867 --> 22:17.334
86th and Broadway, please.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.804
I'm sorry, lady,
there's a cab shortage.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.531
The transit police
are making everyone share.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.574
Oh, no.

22:28.046 --> 22:29.445
Hello.

22:29.614 --> 22:30.706
Oh, no.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.611
I'm sorry.

22:32.784 --> 22:34.081
Oh, no.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.452
No!
