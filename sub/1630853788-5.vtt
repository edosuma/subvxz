hit this emotion and lock on
this expression, you know.

00:28.695 --> 00:33.616
For me, the digital revolution,
it's the best thing that happened to film

00:34.284 --> 00:36.411

I mean, I would never go back.

DOUG CHIANG: <i>When ILM start to make</i>
<i>that transition</i>

00:50.341 --> 00:52.844

it was really all discovery,

00:52.927 --> 00:54.637
an invention at its purest form.

JOHN KNOLL: <i>A lot of what we were doing,</i>

00:56.765 --> 00:59.309

it was the Wild West.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.770
"What if we do this?"
"Okay, let's try that."

01:01.853 --> 01:03.605
Nobody knew what digital could do.

01:04.439 --> 01:08.526
We had to do every little step of the way
to try to build these systems.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.864
<i>But there was a lot of</i>
<i>groaning and moaning.</i>

01:14.657 --> 01:17.035
People were extremely resistant
to making that change.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.037
<i>I mean, they called it "the dark side."</i>

01:20.205 --> 01:23.333

You know, you can do it. Come on.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.796
<i>It was also one of most exciting times,</i>

01:27.879 --> 01:31.591

RON HOWARD: <i>I am not a techie person.</i>
<i>Never have been.</i>

02:54.924 --> 02:58.928
And so when <i>Willow</i> came along,
it was a chance to really go to school,

02:59.012 --> 03:02.307
<i>to really push myself</i>
<i>and be exposed to the culture</i>

03:02.390 --> 03:04.225
<i>at ILM for a couple of years.</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:10.273
I found it just like talking
to a great screenwriter, great composer.

03:10.398 --> 03:14.402
<i>These were creative conversations.</i>
<i>They gave me the menu of possibilities.</i>

03:15.403 --> 03:20.533
<i>Like matte paintings, shooting with</i>
<i>the little Brownies on oversized sets...</i>

03:22.452 --> 03:26.581
<i>They had the motion control camera going</i>
<i>and they had the models.</i>

03:26.664 --> 03:29.125
<i>It was fantastic.</i>

03:30.668 --> 03:35.840
The one thing that really was
a little bit outside the box.

03:36.007 --> 03:40.136
There's this transformation of Fin Raziel,
who is this good sorceress.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.641
She'd been turned into a goat,
and she had to transform to an ostrich,

03:44.724 --> 03:50.271
a turtle, a tiger, and finally back
to a 75-year-old white-haired lady.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.483
<i>I said, yeah, Rick Baker's work</i>

04:03.910 --> 04:06.120
<i>They're fine for action movies.</i>

04:06.204 --> 04:08.539
But this is not
an action sequence, really.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.084
I thought this was more
of a wondrous sequence.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.587
<i>I thought maybe we could</i>
<i>try computer graphics.</i>

04:15.296 --> 04:18.049
RON: <i>He said, "Well,</i>

04:18.132 --> 04:21.803

04:21.886 --> 04:24.389
He said, "No, no, no.
It would be in the computer."

04:25.056 --> 04:26.516
I said...

04:26.599 --> 04:29.477
<i>George explained to me that</i>
<i>he had launched Dennis</i>

04:29.560 --> 04:31.771
<i>in this direction</i>
<i>to explore what computers</i>

04:31.854 --> 04:33.856
<i>could actually mean to making movies.</i>

04:33.940 --> 04:35.775
And I, you know, I didn't want to sound

04:35.858 --> 04:39.487
like too big of a moron,
so I didn't press it too much. (CHUCKLES)

04:39.570 --> 04:41.322
But I was really dubious.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.659
DENNIS: <i>Back then, to be able to do</i>
<i>something with computer graphics</i>

04:44.742 --> 04:48.162
was just foreign to our minds,
including mine, too.

04:49.872 --> 04:53.459
But I knew there was a lot
of talent working here

04:53.543 --> 04:57.672
and a lot of people you can call upon
if you have a problem to try to help

04:57.755 --> 04:59.882
solve it, you know,
a new idea, fresh idea.

04:59.966 --> 05:04.220

someone has done this with a still photo,

05:04.304 --> 05:09.475

sort of moves into a new shape,

05:09.559 --> 05:11.144
"and you can see that other shape."

05:26.909 --> 05:28.703
It was entirely experimental.

Dennis Muren kept apologizing for it.
Like, this may not work.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.208
And for this effect to work,

05:34.292 --> 05:39.213

<i>I knew that there were beautiful things</i>
<i>and exciting things in the world,</i>

06:02.028 --> 06:06.366
but they weren't coming to Kansas City,
that I could see.

06:07.241 --> 06:10.787
<i>My grandmother was a painter.</i>
<i>She loved art.</i>

06:12.330 --> 06:14.624
<i>To be in my grandmother's house</i>
<i>in her studio</i>

06:14.707 --> 06:16.459
<i>and sit with her and paint with her,</i>

06:17.001 --> 06:19.379
<i>that was my refuge as a child.</i>

06:21.339 --> 06:24.008
You can truly just disappear.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.596
<i>My mother used to drop me off</i>
<i>at the Gallery of Art on weekends,</i>

06:28.679 --> 06:31.265
<i>and I would spend the day walking about.</i>

06:32.767 --> 06:35.770
The de Koonings and things
that I couldn't comprehend...

06:36.479 --> 06:38.564
<i>Terrifying modern art.</i>

06:40.858 --> 06:43.069
<i>But I was so drawn to it, I had a sense</i>

06:43.152 --> 06:47.615
that I needed to find a job
that would give me that feeling.

06:49.575 --> 06:53.079
<i>I ended up settling on London,</i>
<i>I gravitated to the theater.</i>

06:53.663 --> 06:55.748
<i>I'd go there at night</i>
<i>and watch the rehearsals.</i>

06:55.832 --> 06:58.793
<i>I'd go in the daytime</i>
<i>and make props and costumes.</i>

07:00.670 --> 07:04.799
<i>And then I was able to work on</i> Labyrinth
<i>with Jim Henson's company.</i>

07:08.010 --> 07:10.096
<i>And I had a little area of expertise,</i>

07:10.179 --> 07:13.182
<i>which was furry creatures</i>
<i>in models and miniatures.</i>

07:16.269 --> 07:18.896
<i>George Lucas came</i>
<i>and looked around the set,</i>

07:20.189 --> 07:23.568
and I was requested to come over
and work on the animals

07:23.651 --> 07:28.281
that changed from one to the other
when Willow's using the wand.

07:30.491 --> 07:35.663
<i>When I arrived, we had to create a goat</i>
<i>and had to match the goat on the set.</i>

07:39.834 --> 07:42.753
<i>But also had to be flexible</i>
<i>and had to have a neck</i>

07:42.837 --> 07:46.799
<i>that would stretch</i>
<i>and match into the ostrich.</i>

07:48.426 --> 07:50.303
<i>Its eyes opened and closed.</i>

07:51.471 --> 07:56.392
Then the peacock fan was built on
an umbrella that would open mechanically.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.770
<i>It all collapsed down,</i>
<i>and then I made a turtle.</i>

08:00.771 --> 08:03.858
<i>Its feet grew out, became covered in fur</i>

08:03.941 --> 08:07.320
<i>that looked like a tiger,</i>
<i>and we had an interim stage</i>

08:07.403 --> 08:11.699
<i>to make prosthetic makeup</i>
<i>for a woman, part tiger,</i>

13:53.999 --> 13:55.334
<i>Learning about high voltage.</i>

13:56.126 --> 13:58.462
-(GUNSHOT)
<i>-There was a camp north of Toronto.</i>

13:58.546 --> 14:01.507
<i>They had a gun range,</i>
<i>I jumped on at age 10.</i>

14:01.590 --> 14:05.386
I didn't want to kill anybody, right?
I was just more interested in mechanism.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.558
Became pretty proficient at that time.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.316
(INTERVIEWER SPEAKING)

14:19.400 --> 14:22.570
I was never in the army.
I was in a special group, that's all.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.489
(INTERVIEWER SPEAKING)

14:26.407 --> 14:27.491
Not really. No.

14:28.075 --> 14:31.245
Something switched in my brain
at about 18 or 19.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.747
<i>The people I was hanging out with,</i>

14:33.831 --> 14:35.791
<i>they were just talking</i>
<i>about killing people.</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:38.794
Whether it was hockey
or talking about guns,

14:39.295 --> 14:41.714
<i>and I didn't want to do that.</i>
<i>You know, I like life.</i>

14:42.882 --> 14:46.135
MARK: <i>I decided I have to get out of here,</i>
<i>and I'm not going to get out of here</i>

14:46.218 --> 14:48.220
by hitchhiking down to the lower 48.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.847
I've got to go to school.

14:49.930 --> 14:54.059
<i>When I went to college, in those days,</i>
<i>computer science was really pretty new.</i>

14:54.143 --> 14:56.145
<i>Computers were still kind of primitive.</i>

14:56.228 --> 14:59.607
And so, while I was studying
computer science, I also took art classes,

14:59.690 --> 15:02.651
and I learned a lot about the art of film.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.070
<i>I was like a sponge, really.</i>

15:06.113 --> 15:08.949
<i>My interest was to make images</i>
<i>with computers</i>

15:09.033 --> 15:11.118
<i>that didn't require the physical reality.</i>

15:13.829 --> 15:16.123
STEVE: <i>I was really enamored</i>
<i>with how things moved,</i>

15:16.206 --> 15:18.459
drawing on paper
and then flipping the paper

15:18.584 --> 15:20.669
and making it move,
which is fascinating to me.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.381
<i>So I went to an animation college.</i>

15:24.924 --> 15:26.216
My hands were so swollen

15:26.300 --> 15:29.595
from hockey fights, I was having
a hard time drawing at the beginning.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.264
<i>But it clicked right away.</i>

15:34.808 --> 15:38.687
<i>I think a lot of life is being</i>
<i>at the right place at the right time.</i>

15:40.189 --> 15:42.316
<i>I knew a guy that worked</i>
<i>at the company Alias,</i>

15:42.399 --> 15:45.611
<i>and they made three-dimensional</i>
<i>modeling software.</i>

15:46.570 --> 15:50.366
They brought me in as being one
of the only classically trained animators.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.202
<i>Alias would send me all over the world.</i>

15:53.285 --> 15:55.621
They'd sent me to Ferrari
or send me to Boeing,

15:55.704 --> 15:58.290
and they'd throw an engine part
and say, "Model that, kid."

15:58.415 --> 16:00.250
So I became really fast at it.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.881
I wanted to get a PhD and I go to Berkeley
and it's just happening.

16:09.093 --> 16:14.223
All right. The topic for today, first
of all, is the rendering of polygons.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.351
MARK: <i>Ed Catmull was teaching</i>
<i>a class with Jim Blinn.</i>

16:18.018 --> 16:20.771
<i>These guys are luminaries,</i>
<i>they're visiting professors</i>

16:20.854 --> 16:23.524
<i>because they are now starting</i>
<i>the Lucasfilm computer group.</i>

16:23.607 --> 16:27.736
<i>And they had this vision, particularly Ed,</i>
<i>of making a movie with computers.</i>

16:28.612 --> 16:30.447
<i>And I learned a lot from him.</i>

16:30.531 --> 16:34.618
<i>I was really there because I wanted to use</i>
<i>technology in creative endeavors.</i>

16:35.703 --> 16:37.538
<i>So when I finish a PhD at Berkeley...</i>

16:40.624 --> 16:43.585
I had this vision of like, "We're gonna
make movies in our own world."

16:43.669 --> 16:48.382
We're like little gods, but it was really
hard to do because it cost so much money.

16:49.299 --> 16:55.639
Then I heard that at ILM, they were trying
to make a realistic water creature.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.606
JAMES CAMERON: <i>There were some</i>
<i>pretty serious challenges to this thing,</i>

17:04.690 --> 17:07.985
but when I'm writing,
I don't want to worry

17:08.068 --> 17:11.113
about how we're actually going to do it.
Let's just get the image.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.492
<i>And I had imagined this scene,</i>
<i>which we called the pseudopod scene,</i>

17:15.576 --> 17:19.204
<i>and it's this kind of water tentacle</i>
<i>that comes into the human base</i>

17:19.288 --> 17:23.167
<i>and looks around,</i>
<i>but it's intelligently controlled water.</i>

17:26.420 --> 17:28.172
But the question was, how to do it.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.216
We really wanted <i>The Abyss.</i>

17:31.300 --> 17:34.636
<i>Dennis really was excited</i>
<i>about computer graphics.</i>

17:34.720 --> 17:38.432
I was doing marketing at the time
and set up a breakfast meeting

17:38.515 --> 17:41.310
between Dennis Muren and James Cameron.

17:41.852 --> 17:45.105
JAMES: <i>What I was imagining,</i>
<i>nobody could quite figure out how to do.</i>

17:45.397 --> 17:50.110
So I was thinking of things
like Claymation with white clay,

17:50.235 --> 17:53.614
and we'd project high-speed photography
of water,

17:53.697 --> 17:57.451
and we'd animate the clay
to follow the ripples in the water.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.454
It would have been very clunky,
very difficult, maybe a little jittery.

18:00.537 --> 18:04.374
I actually looked to that show, at the
artwork and hearing him describe it,

18:04.625 --> 18:08.337
and thought, "No, no, no, there's got
to be another way you can do this."

18:09.129 --> 18:11.381
JAMES: <i>I was very, very leery about CG.</i>

18:11.465 --> 18:13.300
<i>It was not an area I knew anything about.</i>

18:13.383 --> 18:16.261
Felt like it would be so opaque
that I wouldn't be, as a director,

18:16.345 --> 18:19.848
really able to to control it
or even know what to ask for.

18:20.808 --> 18:25.521
<i>At that point in time, there had been</i>
<i>one fully integrated character</i>

18:25.771 --> 18:28.899
<i>in a motion picture</i>
<i>that was generated by CG.</i>

18:34.154 --> 18:35.697
DENNIS: <i>On the movie</i>
Young Sherlock Holmes,

18:35.781 --> 18:37.825
I had to come up with
something you've never seen,

18:37.908 --> 18:39.993
and it was actually my wife
that came up with it.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.037
<i>A flat, stained glass figure,</i>

18:42.121 --> 18:45.541
<i>but you take out all the lead</i>
<i>that's holding the glass together.</i>

18:45.624 --> 18:48.794
So you have a hundred pieces
all close to each other,

18:48.877 --> 18:50.754
but they're not touching each other.

18:50.838 --> 18:55.134
<i>They can walk as one,</i>
<i>and that's perfect for computer graphics.</i>

18:56.468 --> 19:00.556
<i>Our little group did it.</i>
<i>It took six months to do seven shots.</i>

19:01.140 --> 19:04.810
It was an achievement in its time,
but there were no soft surfaces.

19:04.893 --> 19:10.440
<i>It was all hard surfaces that were being</i>
<i>animated into this concept of a figure.</i>

19:11.024 --> 19:14.862
<i>But Dennis said, "We're now doing stuff</i>
<i>with fluid surfaces,</i>

19:14.945 --> 19:18.574
"with some of our software
that we're just developing.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.201
"We might be able to show you something."

19:22.536 --> 19:23.996
DENNIS: <i>The night before he came by,</i>

19:24.079 --> 19:29.293
<i>we spent the night doing a test</i>
<i>of a really quick rendered model.</i>

19:29.418 --> 19:32.754
<i>Not at all photo-real, but it did show</i>
<i>the shape moving by itself.</i>

19:32.838 --> 19:35.132
Now we can actually
play that animation back.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.429
<i>And you can see here the pseudopod</i>

19:40.596 --> 19:44.308
<i>sort of lifting his head up</i>
<i>and pulling itself forward a bit.</i>

19:45.225 --> 19:48.520
The ILM test was not a slam dunk
by any stretch.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.981
<i>But Dennis said,</i>
<i>"It's going to take this many months.</i>

19:51.064 --> 19:54.026
<i>"We need X amount of time</i>
<i>to develop a new toolset."</i>

19:54.234 --> 19:57.112
And so I thought, one,
total leap of faith.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.532
Two, it will be so (BLEEP) cool.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.704
JIM: <i>We had a lot of the technology</i>
<i>Pixar had left behind.</i>

20:10.167 --> 20:13.503
We didn't really know how to do it
or how we would get it all done,

20:13.587 --> 20:15.464
we're kind of figuring it out as we go.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.799
<i>And we didn't have a very big crew.</i>

20:17.883 --> 20:21.762
<i>So we had no choice but to grow</i>
<i>the computer graphics department.</i>

20:21.845 --> 20:23.847
MARK: <i>I met with Doug Kay</i>
<i>and George Joblove,</i>

20:23.972 --> 20:26.558
<i>who at that time</i>
<i>were running the ILM computer group.</i>

20:26.642 --> 20:28.644
<i>I thought, "Here is a chance</i>

20:28.727 --> 20:32.814
"to take these ideas I have
and actually make something."

20:32.898 --> 20:34.983
JIM: <i>Mark Dippé knew how to write code,</i>

20:35.067 --> 20:37.778
<i>and could just see</i>
<i>what Jim wanted in the film.</i>

20:38.862 --> 20:40.614
<i>And on the other end of the spectrum</i>

20:40.697 --> 20:44.034
<i>is Steve Williams,</i>
<i>kind of a mechanical age guy</i>

20:44.326 --> 20:46.662
<i>who somehow found himself</i>
<i>in the digital world.</i>

20:47.079 --> 20:48.830
<i>We brought him in to be an animator.</i>

20:49.748 --> 20:52.334
Dennis was the supervisor
on the team there.

20:54.419 --> 20:58.340
Dennis came to set, but we were shooting
in a kind of distant location

20:58.423 --> 21:00.884
<i>and he had some gigs</i>
<i>that he was running at ILM.</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:03.887
So he had to send John Knoll out
to babysit us

21:03.971 --> 21:06.306
and make sure we didn't
screw up too badly. (LAUGHS)

21:08.558 --> 21:10.519
JOHN: <i>I'd been doing a lot of work</i>
<i>with Dennis Muren,</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:16.400
and my enthusiasm and interest
led to him asking me to move to <i>The Abyss.</i>

21:16.483 --> 21:18.527
<i>I was the guy who was on set</i>

21:18.610 --> 21:22.322
and in the computer graphics department
every day, keeping an eye on things.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.200
<i>It was all brand new.</i>

21:25.826 --> 21:28.120
<i>When we were shooting</i>
<i>the background plates</i>

21:28.203 --> 21:31.832
the pseudopod was going to go into,
wherever the camera is inside the set,

21:31.915 --> 21:34.334
I'm gonna need to note later
because we need to put

21:34.418 --> 21:38.588
a computer camera in a virtual set so
that we get the perspective right on this.

21:39.172 --> 21:43.593
<i>We marked where the camera is</i>
<i>on these Xerox floor plans of these sets.</i>

21:44.136 --> 21:46.638
<i>What focal length we're using,</i>
<i>how high the camera is.</i>

21:47.723 --> 21:50.934
JAMES: <i>They said every time the</i>
<i>camera moves, that could be a problem.</i>

21:51.018 --> 21:53.312
I said that it doesn't matter.
The camera's going to move.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.688
Some of it was handheld.

21:54.771 --> 21:58.984
So John had to inhabit this zone
between the crazy director

21:59.067 --> 22:00.944
that wanted to move the camera around

22:01.028 --> 22:05.324
<i>and do what needed to be done</i>
<i>at ILM in Marin.</i>

22:05.407 --> 22:07.951
MARK: <i>There was a lot of conceptual work</i>
<i>that had been done.</i>

22:08.035 --> 22:09.077
You could visualize it.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.496
But then the real problem is
how the hell do you do it?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.124
<i>How do you simulate water?</i>
<i>How do you make water ripple?</i>

22:14.207 --> 22:15.876
<i>How do we develop a face on the end?</i>

22:16.626 --> 22:18.128
<i>We had to create all this stuff.</i>

22:19.755 --> 22:23.508
One of the other challenges
was that water is a combination

22:23.592 --> 22:25.218
of reflection and refraction.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.305
<i>For refraction, we were going to use</i>
<i>the background plate</i>

22:28.388 --> 22:30.682
<i>and distort it to be</i>
<i>what you see through it.</i>

22:30.766 --> 22:33.685
But for reflection,
that's everything around us,

22:33.769 --> 22:36.188
<i>and over the course</i>
<i>of the couple of days of shooting,</i>

22:36.271 --> 22:38.815
<i>I would have photographed</i>
<i>every part of the set.</i>

22:39.024 --> 22:42.319
But then you had to seam them
all together into an environment.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.196
Boom! Photoshop.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.698
MARK: <i>Fortunately, John Knoll was involved</i>

22:46.782 --> 22:48.950
<i>with Photoshop at that time,</i>
<i>and he had a version</i>

22:49.034 --> 22:51.870
<i>that we would work with</i>
<i>and use as a demo or test.</i>

22:52.496 --> 22:56.416
<i>So we took all the images with the</i>
<i>computer, and we built in a little room,</i>

22:57.709 --> 23:00.837
<i>and that water snake, now it's refracting</i>
<i>and reflecting the world.</i>

23:01.421 --> 23:03.423
But when you render
something on a computer,

23:03.507 --> 23:05.467
it has an unnatural perfection to it.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.805
It looked like a magic trick.
The water was too clear.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.849
MARK: <i>That was the kind of thing</i>
<i>Dennis is very, very sensitive to.</i>

23:13.600 --> 23:16.061
JIM: <i>How would we build</i>
<i>environments around that</i>

23:16.144 --> 23:18.730
so that it felt like, you know,
belonged in that area?

23:18.814 --> 23:21.858
And he, of course, just instinctively knew

23:21.942 --> 23:24.027
all of those problems
that had to be solved.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.449
MARK: <i>He knew all of the traditional</i>
<i>techniques inside and out.</i>

23:31.451 --> 23:33.912
<i>He really became my mentor</i>
<i>in the system there.</i>

23:33.995 --> 23:36.164
DENNIS: <i>I told him,</i>
<i>"Just introduce a little</i>

23:36.456 --> 23:39.209
<i>"brightness over the blacks</i>
<i>and suddenly..."</i>

23:40.710 --> 23:42.254
<i>It's got weight. It's lifting up.</i>

23:42.337 --> 23:44.965
<i>It's moving around</i>
<i>and it doesn't look like a trick.</i>

23:45.048 --> 23:46.508
<i>It looks much more realistic.</i>

23:47.300 --> 23:53.515
When the water tentacle comes
onto the screen, and the face forms...

23:57.936 --> 24:02.649
<i>I remember that moment being</i>
<i>one of the turning points in my life.</i>

24:03.108 --> 24:06.653
I knew when I saw that
that ILM could do anything...

24:09.072 --> 24:11.199
and that's where I wanted to be.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.910
-No, no, no, no, no.
-It's okay, it's okay.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.121
What is it?

24:18.665 --> 24:20.292
Is it alive?

24:23.962 --> 24:28.425
-Lindsey, no.
-Sea water.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.888
It's only 90 seconds
of running time of that character

24:32.971 --> 24:35.432
spread over, you know,
four or five-minute sequence.

24:35.974 --> 24:40.353
But it did start the new era
of digital effects in motion pictures.

24:41.188 --> 24:46.401
DENNIS: <i>After we did</i> The Abyss,
<i>I saw that this has got a future.</i>

24:46.485 --> 24:49.321
I've got to figure this out,
you know, I need this tool,

24:49.446 --> 24:52.574
and I want to understand the tool.
So I decided to take a year off.

24:53.992 --> 24:59.122
<i>I bought this book on computer graphics</i>
<i>that's like 1,800 pages long.</i>

24:59.206 --> 25:01.082
<i>Read it in the local coffee shop here.</i>

25:03.960 --> 25:08.465
And came away realizing
that there's no magic involved.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.133
Everything can be defined.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.888
That was just really exciting to me
that the shots are all in progress.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.974
They're built incrementally
so you can improve things

25:18.058 --> 25:21.186
or change things all the way
through the process

25:21.811 --> 25:24.314
to make them look as good
as what's in your mind.

25:26.274 --> 25:29.027
<i>There was no limit</i>
<i>on your own imagination,</i>

25:29.569 --> 25:31.321
and it just needed to be pursued.

25:31.988 --> 25:34.074
I can't explain it any more than that.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.578
JEAN: <i>Dennis, he saw the future there</i>

25:39.079 --> 25:41.331
way before anybody else

25:41.456 --> 25:43.416
was thinking about that
here in the company.

25:48.964 --> 25:53.552
<i>For a long time in the Model Shop,</i>
<i>in those early days of CG,</i>

25:54.511 --> 25:56.179
<i>we were under the impression</i>

25:56.263 --> 26:00.767
that their work was just going to be
sort of enhancing what we were doing.

26:01.434 --> 26:04.980
<i>That it would be an additional kind</i>
<i>of decorative thing</i>

26:05.105 --> 26:10.235
<i>and that we would still</i>
<i>always be the center of work.</i>

26:12.362 --> 26:15.865
A lot of departments
were sort of slightly wistful

26:15.949 --> 26:18.827
of the work that we did
because we were the ones

26:18.910 --> 26:21.788
<i>that got to throw paint around</i>
<i>and build things.</i>

26:23.373 --> 26:25.333
This is a late night delirious camp.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.212
Oh, my... Hey. Hi, silly.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.299
JOHN GOODSON: <i>I saw the Model Shop</i>
<i>like being this machine</i>

26:32.382 --> 26:35.719
made up of people that had
a really broad spectrum background

26:35.802 --> 26:37.554
that brought all different
kinds of things to it.

26:39.139 --> 26:43.935
KIM: <i>I was always amazed</i>
<i>by how well choreographed we were.</i>

26:45.854 --> 26:48.023
GOODSON: <i>I came here in '88.</i>
<i>I just wanted to make stuff.</i>

26:48.148 --> 26:50.066
<i>I always wanted to work with my hands.</i>

26:52.360 --> 26:55.405
KIM: <i>He was this young kid at the time.</i>

26:56.448 --> 26:59.701
He was pretty quiet.
I mean, he could come into a room

26:59.784 --> 27:02.203
and you wouldn't even know
he'd come in and left again,

27:02.912 --> 27:04.789
<i>and so hard-working.</i>

27:05.957 --> 27:08.209
<i>On</i> Ghostbusters II,

27:08.293 --> 27:11.296
they had these scenes that were
in the bowels of Grand Central Station.

27:11.379 --> 27:15.467
I'm in some kind of a chamber.
There's some tile work.

27:15.550 --> 27:19.763
-Slime! It's a river of slime!
-What?

27:21.264 --> 27:24.559
KIM: <i>The vaults of this thing,</i>
<i>we had to build in the Model Shop.</i>

27:27.145 --> 27:30.774
<i>They had actually made little tiles</i>
<i>and laid them in,</i>

27:31.566 --> 27:36.738
but there was some bare wood visible,
so they had me work on that,

27:37.197 --> 27:39.199
<i>and I drew them all on.</i>

27:39.616 --> 27:41.951
It worked super well and really fast.

27:42.035 --> 27:45.246
And you came over
and you complimented me on it

27:45.330 --> 27:47.707
because it looked really, really good.

27:48.124 --> 27:51.419
<i>So I remember that was the first time</i>
<i>I think I ever talked to you.</i>

27:57.175 --> 27:59.469
GOODSON: <i>But you wind up working</i>
<i>with people in the shop</i>

27:59.552 --> 28:01.513
and you develop a relationship with them.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.767
<i>You know, you're crawling</i>
<i>all over something</i>

28:05.892 --> 28:07.394
<i>and you're in each other's faces,</i>

28:07.477 --> 28:09.646
<i>everybody knows their thing</i>
<i>and they know what to do,</i>

28:09.729 --> 28:12.565
and it was just kind of...
That was the way the relationship...

28:12.649 --> 28:16.069
It came from that, you know,
it was this working thing.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.283
<i>And then over time</i>
<i>I'd become more talkative</i>

28:22.367 --> 28:24.911
and comfortable being a lot louder.
(LAUGHING)

28:24.994 --> 28:27.205
Sometimes you want him to stop talking.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.790
-Now.
-Sometimes, but...

28:28.873 --> 28:30.417
(BOTH LAUGHING)

28:31.668 --> 28:33.086
KIM: <i>We make a pretty good pair.</i>

28:36.172 --> 28:37.340
JEAN: <i>The joy of working</i>

28:37.465 --> 28:40.635
was being together,
physically working with your hands

28:40.719 --> 28:42.887
and interacting with each other all day.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.681
We had a playground.

28:44.764 --> 28:48.268
-We'll do a fly-by.
-Okay. Beautiful.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.687
-Oh, hi, Dennis.
-Hi.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.481
-How's it going?
-Hi, Bill.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.108
-Home movies.
-Walk it up.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.360
WOMAN: Don't drop the baby!

29:00.113 --> 29:03.032
JEAN: <i>The family sense</i>
<i>of all working together</i>

29:03.116 --> 29:06.035
<i>and collectively really didn't change much</i>

29:06.119 --> 29:11.416
until computer graphics became an obvious
competitor for the shop.

29:11.499 --> 29:14.544
There were so many people
that were skilled

29:14.627 --> 29:17.797
in the arts of the photochemical ways.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.759
<i>They didn't know how to just pick up</i>
<i>and change like,</i>

29:20.884 --> 29:22.886
<i>"Oh, we're gonna do</i>
<i>everything differently now."</i>

29:22.969 --> 29:27.098
<i>So in '91, when I was promoted</i>
<i>to general manager,</i>

29:27.182 --> 29:29.309
we did offer training to people

29:29.392 --> 29:33.480
who were in traditional departments
to see if we could move them over.

29:34.105 --> 29:38.943
I immediately recognized
that computer graphics were one more tool.

29:39.736 --> 29:43.573
<i>I saw it as just another</i>
<i>bunch of paint and brushes.</i>

29:44.491 --> 29:46.242
I don't think anybody else much saw it

29:46.326 --> 29:48.828
that way at the time,
at least not in the Model Shop.

29:49.370 --> 29:52.957
When people started leaving and going
to the computer graphics department,

29:53.041 --> 29:55.251
I was one of those people
that had resentment about it

29:55.335 --> 29:57.253
because I felt like,
"Hey, they're taking apart

29:57.337 --> 29:58.880
"this machine we have over here."

30:00.215 --> 30:03.259
<i>The Model Shop was this great organism</i>
<i>that could do anything.</i>

30:03.343 --> 30:06.137
<i>But then these key pieces</i>
<i>were being pulled out of it.</i>

30:08.264 --> 30:10.350
ROSE: <i>Jean was one of the few people</i>
<i>that adapted.</i>

30:11.142 --> 30:16.105
She learned the digital tools
and became quite proficient at them.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.025
JEAN: <i>My training evolved</i>
<i>into the opportunity</i>

30:19.108 --> 30:22.821
<i>to work on a film as a view painter.</i>

30:22.904 --> 30:24.656
I would still come
and go in the Model Shop,

30:25.490 --> 30:29.619
<i>but I was feeling less and less</i>
<i>like I was welcome there.</i>

30:31.204 --> 30:33.206
It was very hard to watch
your little community

30:33.289 --> 30:34.791
kind of being torn down around you.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.543
That's kind of what it felt like.

30:38.461 --> 30:41.756
And they called it "the dark side."
You know, and I had these feelings, too.

30:43.466 --> 30:48.596
JEAN: <i>They felt that I was not being</i>
<i>loyal, but I wasn't going to go hide.</i>

30:49.597 --> 30:52.517
I was determined to bridge those gaps.

30:53.268 --> 30:58.147
<i>I also really could see</i>
<i>that the Model Shop jobs were threatened.</i>

31:01.526 --> 31:04.279
It was starting to have,
like "My God, this is going to have

31:04.362 --> 31:07.365
"consequences for the Model Shop,"
because people give you the book,

31:07.448 --> 31:09.200
What's the Color of your Parachute?

31:09.284 --> 31:12.620
<i>How to Reorganize Your Life</i>
<i>and Reinvent Yourself.</i>

31:15.832 --> 31:17.500
<i>I remember talking to Dennis about it,</i>

31:17.625 --> 31:21.671
and he said, "Well, I would guess,
maybe you only have

31:22.130 --> 31:24.591
"two, two and a half more years
or something like that."

31:24.674 --> 31:30.221
It's like, jeez, that was really
depressing, you know, to think of that.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.729
<i>The Model Shop, camera department,</i>
<i>stage, all of those things,</i>

31:38.354 --> 31:42.525
<i>that was the foundations of ILM.</i>
<i>That was becoming less and less important.</i>

31:42.609 --> 31:45.737
<i>Computer graphics was becoming</i>
<i>bigger and bigger and bigger.</i>

31:47.155 --> 31:50.742
All of that's happening, and we were
hiring a lot of new people that had

31:50.867 --> 31:54.954
specialty in the digital side
to kind of meet the demand.

32:02.921 --> 32:08.301
I was born in Hong Kong
under the colonial rule by the British.

32:10.303 --> 32:14.474
<i>I was lucky to have a mother</i>
<i>who actually loves movies.</i>

32:14.891 --> 32:20.396
When you have five kids, you want some
sort of release between chores.

32:21.856 --> 32:24.609
<i>I went to a very traditional</i>
<i>girl's school.</i>

32:25.151 --> 32:29.781
As part of the education,
they would take us to see classic movies.

32:29.864 --> 32:34.577
And the first one was <i>War and Peace,</i>
then we did <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

32:36.329 --> 32:42.293
And then, at the age of 15, I was
introduced to this film called <i>Star Wars.</i>

32:42.543 --> 32:43.711
Here they come.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.340
I was blown away.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.845
<i>Star Wars</i> planted a seed in me.

32:53.304 --> 32:57.350
<i>This world is bigger than</i>
<i>what you are experiencing.</i>

32:57.600 --> 33:03.898
So that name, Industrial Light and Magic,
left a very, very strong impression,

33:04.649 --> 33:06.025
you know, in my mind.

33:07.986 --> 33:12.031
<i>I really wanted to travel,</i>
<i>so I went to London.</i>

33:12.740 --> 33:17.704
<i>I started thinking I might like</i>
<i>to work in the film industry</i>

33:17.787 --> 33:20.289
<i>when I was doing my post-graduate studies,</i>

33:20.540 --> 33:23.126
discovering how to paint digitally.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.670
<i>This is early '80s.</i>

33:31.426 --> 33:37.015
And then eventually, in addition
to being able to animate and paint,

33:37.098 --> 33:42.854
I could also do the technical part,
which is write code, and I worked

33:42.937 --> 33:44.814
<i>at a production company in London.</i>

33:45.273 --> 33:48.484
<i>They got this campaign,</i>
<i>a census commercial,</i>

33:48.568 --> 33:52.280
and what they wanted to do
is to make a baby talk.

33:52.947 --> 33:56.701
<i>Who am I? Where am I from?</i>
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

33:57.368 --> 33:58.786
There was quite a lot of dialogue.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.999
It was a very ambitious campaign
and I was doing it by myself.

34:03.082 --> 34:06.544
No one has ever made anything talk,
not even talking animals.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.007
<i>I packed my bags and said to my husband,</i>

34:11.090 --> 34:14.510
"I'm gonna live at my work
for three days. Don't disturb me.

34:14.594 --> 34:18.681
"I'm gonna have to come up with something
pretty spectacular to get this done."

34:19.849 --> 34:22.894
Hello, may I ask you a few questions?

34:23.478 --> 34:24.812
When was I born?

34:25.521 --> 34:29.650
Where will I go to school?
What kind of house will I live in?

34:29.734 --> 34:32.612
MAN: <i>The census, it counts</i>
<i>because you count.</i>

34:33.780 --> 34:36.616
When it came out, it was one of the most

34:36.699 --> 34:40.244
well-received commercials
during that time.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.455
INTERVIEWER:
Ellen, how long did all this take?

34:42.538 --> 34:44.916
Um, the commercial was 30 seconds.

34:45.333 --> 34:50.046
So I had to make up 750 grids,
each of a different shape.

34:50.129 --> 34:51.589
<i>Through the grapevine,</i>

34:51.672 --> 34:55.593
<i>Industrial Light & Magic</i>
<i>heard about me in London,</i>

34:55.676 --> 34:58.387
and wanted to meet with me.

34:58.471 --> 35:02.183
That's something I've been
dreaming of since I was 15,

35:02.600 --> 35:05.603
and I couldn't possibly
let that opportunity

35:06.687 --> 35:08.356
slip through my fingers.

35:09.398 --> 35:15.780
I was very much in love with my husband,
but he wanted to stay in London.

35:16.531 --> 35:20.576
<i>He was very understanding and said,</i>
<i>"Well, you do what you got to do."</i>

35:20.660 --> 35:22.703
<i>That was my crossroad.</i>

35:24.288 --> 35:27.792
We said we'll just carry
on seeing each other.

35:27.875 --> 35:32.964
But eventually, of course,
you know, we separated.

35:33.631 --> 35:37.009
But we had to follow our dreams, right?

35:42.849 --> 35:47.895
<i>As time goes by, I started to actually</i>
<i>get to know this group of people.</i>

35:50.022 --> 35:52.024
<i>We started to create a bond.</i>

35:52.692 --> 35:55.403
<i>My family was in Hong Kong and in England.</i>

35:55.486 --> 35:58.156
I was by myself in San Francisco.

35:58.781 --> 36:02.493
<i>So these people became my brothers,</i>
<i>my sisters.</i>

36:03.786 --> 36:07.373
DOUG CHIANG: <i>ILM brought these highly</i>
<i>talented people from all over the world</i>

36:07.456 --> 36:10.168
into this one spot to work together.

36:10.251 --> 36:14.297
<i>It was a really exciting time</i>
<i>because the company blossomed, it grew.</i>

36:15.923 --> 36:18.259
STEVE: <i>It's like coming to</i>
<i>an amusement park, right?</i>

36:18.342 --> 36:19.719
<i>And you're not paying to get in.</i>

36:19.802 --> 36:22.096
They're paying you
to be in the amusement park.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.723
And that's what it was like here.

36:23.848 --> 36:28.352
All of us were in our twenties,
trying to find ourselves.

36:28.769 --> 36:32.231
<i>We were not just interested</i>
<i>in computer graphics.</i>

36:32.356 --> 36:35.443
<i>We were also, like, exploring life.</i>

36:36.777 --> 36:38.905
STEVE: <i>From the people to the technology,</i>

36:38.988 --> 36:41.949
to the speculation
about the future of humanity,

36:42.408 --> 36:45.411
it was a free education on so many levels.

36:46.746 --> 36:50.041
We're all relatively young,
and we worked long hours, you know.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.251
It's the whole thing.
"Work hard, play hard."

36:52.335 --> 36:57.131
We would hang out in Mark Dippé
and Spaz's office, called "the pit."

36:57.215 --> 36:59.800
I would like to introduce you
to one of my havens

36:59.926 --> 37:02.178
of supposed creativity,
called "the pit," here at

37:02.261 --> 37:04.138
Industrial Light and Mashed Potatoes.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.933
STEVE: <i>The pit was an old sound room here.</i>

37:07.016 --> 37:08.893
"Mix beat," they used to call it
or something.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.103
But George Lucas came in once and he goes,

37:11.187 --> 37:13.814
<i>"Yeah, this is where I formed EditDroid,</i>
<i>in this room."</i>

37:13.898 --> 37:15.524
Spaz was a little...

37:18.361 --> 37:22.490
DOUG: <i>The Pit had this reputation</i>
<i>of being this bad boy hangout place.</i>

37:22.573 --> 37:24.242
Definitely not the ILM that I knew.

37:24.992 --> 37:28.037
<i>The first time I went in there,</i>
<i>it was literally like a man cave,</i>

37:28.120 --> 37:31.415
and there was this energy in there
that was distinctly rebel-like.

37:32.124 --> 37:33.292
STEVE: <i>We had everything.</i>

37:33.376 --> 37:37.171
Dartboard, beer, you know,
it was just... It was crazy.

37:40.341 --> 37:41.342
(LAUGHING)

37:41.425 --> 37:42.927
We would just throw these nutty parties

37:43.010 --> 37:45.012
because it was soundproof
and you'd shut the door,

37:45.096 --> 37:47.223
heavy door, nobody's going to give a crap.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.314
The place would get destroyed.

37:55.398 --> 37:58.317
Our office, security
came in and took pictures.

38:04.573 --> 38:07.201
I still have dreams about that place.
It's really strange.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.704
I mean, I lived there, I lived there.

38:12.206 --> 38:17.586
DOUG: <i>It was great because we were at this</i>
<i>ground level of discovery and as an artist</i>

38:17.670 --> 38:21.007
working with Spaz, working with Dennis,
with the computer graphic artists

38:21.090 --> 38:24.885
at that time, we were able to merge
all these different disciplines together.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.055
<i>I was at the right place</i>
<i>at the right time.</i>

38:29.890 --> 38:32.226
<i>I was born in Taiwan in 1962.</i>

38:35.563 --> 38:37.189
<i>And when I was about four or five,</i>

38:37.356 --> 38:39.650
my parents moved over
to Detroit, Michigan.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.528
<i>My father was an engineer</i>
<i>at Ford Motor Company.</i>

38:44.697 --> 38:48.743
<i>And we were probably one of the few</i>
<i>Asian families in that community.</i>

38:50.036 --> 38:52.455
<i>I was kind of like</i>
<i>a fish out of water, really.</i>

38:53.080 --> 38:55.124
And so I was picked on constantly.

38:55.207 --> 38:58.878
<i>I remember going through high school,</i>
<i>just a very unpleasant experience.</i>

38:59.879 --> 39:03.174
<i>That's where I started to discover art</i>
<i>and I started to draw a lot.</i>

39:03.257 --> 39:04.759
<i>I wanted to escape reality.</i>

39:05.426 --> 39:10.222
And what transformed me really was
seeing two films in 1977.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.558
<i>One was Harryhausen's</i>
Golden Voyage of Sinbad,

39:12.641 --> 39:13.893
<i>the other one was</i> Star Wars.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.065
Both of those films
transported me into different worlds,

39:19.148 --> 39:21.817
<i>and I want to know more about the process.</i>

39:21.901 --> 39:25.529
<i>This is when they start to publish</i>
<i>art books and "making of" books.</i>

39:26.197 --> 39:29.617
<i>Magazines where they actually showed you</i>
<i>filmmakers like Steve Galich,</i>

39:29.700 --> 39:34.622
<i>and Lorne Peterson, Richard Edlund,</i>
<i>Ken Ralston, and Dennis Muren.</i>

39:36.165 --> 39:40.336
<i>And I saw all the artwork, the creativity,</i>
<i>from Ralph McQuarrie and Joe Johnston,</i>

39:40.878 --> 39:44.006
<i>and I was like, "Wow, these are</i>
<i>the people doing the craft."</i>

39:44.590 --> 39:47.426
<i>I thought they had trained</i>
<i>for years to do this job.</i>

39:47.510 --> 39:49.804
In reality, they were all
very new to it as well.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.931
<i>And I thought, "Okay,</i>
<i>there's hope for me."</i>

39:52.014 --> 39:54.809
<i>And I went into the basement</i>
<i>and started to create my sets</i>

39:54.892 --> 39:56.936
<i>and started learning</i>
<i>about filmmaking on my own.</i>

39:57.019 --> 39:59.230
<i>Model building, animation.</i>

40:01.232 --> 40:03.109
<i>I ended up at UCLA.</i>

40:03.192 --> 40:05.903
<i>One of my first films was called</i>
Mental Block.

40:05.986 --> 40:08.489
It was a four-minute,
experimental stop motion film

40:08.572 --> 40:10.116
that I did sort of in my dorm room.

40:10.866 --> 40:13.327
(GRUNTING)

40:13.411 --> 40:15.037
(LOUD RUMBLING)

40:15.121 --> 40:16.831
(GROANS)

40:17.915 --> 40:20.000
<i>And that won first place</i>
<i>in the Focus Awards.</i>

40:21.544 --> 40:24.755
And the first prize was a car.
And I was like, "Okay, fantastic."

40:24.839 --> 40:28.300
I got a car in college.
Maybe filmmaking could be a career.

40:30.219 --> 40:34.640
<i>In the mid-1980s, I started working</i>
<i>for a company called Digital Productions.</i>

40:34.807 --> 40:38.769
They were doing movie titles,
flying logos, companies show IDs,

40:39.311 --> 40:41.814
<i>and I learned how to design</i>
<i>for computer graphics.</i>

40:42.690 --> 40:45.693
Lasted a good several years,
and then I actually got

40:45.776 --> 40:48.487
an invitation to interview
for the ILM art department.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.948
I moved out of my apartment,
packed everything up,

40:51.031 --> 40:53.909
and I drove north because I thought
this was my foot in the door.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.619
<i>I was gonna put it all in.</i>

40:56.704 --> 40:59.498
Who are these key people
who were there at that time?

40:59.582 --> 41:02.501
People I'd seen when I was 15 years old
in these documentaries,

41:02.626 --> 41:04.920
I was like, here they were in person.

41:05.588 --> 41:09.592
<i>I remember the first day walking through</i>
<i>the hallway, and I just saw this figure.</i>

41:09.800 --> 41:12.136
I knew it was Dennis Muren
because he's so iconic

41:12.219 --> 41:13.679
and I've seen so many pictures of him.

41:13.762 --> 41:17.308
And me being the new kid at ILM,
it was just like, wow!

41:17.391 --> 41:19.393
Okay, you do live up to your stature.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.147
<i>Everybody knew all the projects.</i>

41:23.355 --> 41:26.650
<i>We were all in everybody else's dailies,</i>
<i>and we could all work together.</i>

41:30.613 --> 41:35.659
<i>Whether it was</i> Roger Rabbit,
<i>or</i> Death Becomes Her,

41:36.660 --> 41:39.413
<i>they were all very different,</i>
<i>and they were all very specific.</i>

41:41.916 --> 41:44.126
MARK: <i>ILM was this laboratory</i>
<i>experience in a sense,</i>

41:44.210 --> 41:47.129
because you're being asked
to do things no one's ever done.

41:48.881 --> 41:52.259
<i>I remember one day Dennis goes,</i>
<i>"Jim Cameron just called again."</i>

41:52.384 --> 41:56.847
He wants us to do this thing,
and this is a lot bigger than <i>The Abyss.</i>

41:59.600 --> 42:02.895
You had to basically sign something
that you could sit down in a room here

42:02.978 --> 42:04.438
when somebody was sort of out there

42:04.522 --> 42:06.607
waiting for you to finish
reading the script.

42:09.610 --> 42:12.821
I remember reading it going,
"How the hell are we gonna do this?"

42:12.905 --> 42:15.574
I said, "That's it,
we have to build a human being."

42:16.158 --> 42:17.868
JAMES: <i>In</i> T2,

42:17.952 --> 42:21.455
<i>I wanted to have a worthy adversary</i>
<i>to Arnold's Terminator</i>

42:21.539 --> 42:25.793
but something so unlike him
that it wasn't just two robots

42:25.876 --> 42:28.087
doing, you know, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.

42:28.462 --> 42:30.798
<i>I imagined this kind of</i>
<i>liquid metal terminator.</i>

42:31.799 --> 42:32.841
<i>But the question was,</i>

42:32.925 --> 42:37.012
"Can we hang the whole movie
on a soft surface character with CG?"

42:38.764 --> 42:41.642
If Dennis said we couldn't do it,
I wasn't gonna do it.

42:42.393 --> 42:45.563
DENNIS: <i>We did some tests here</i>
<i>to make sure that we could do the job,</i>

42:45.646 --> 42:49.108
that we could make a chrome figure
move around, change shape.

42:49.191 --> 42:50.859
It was kind of fun to be able to throw

42:50.943 --> 42:53.279
such a huge challenge
down in front of them and say,

42:53.362 --> 42:56.073
"We're gonna underwrite you
to write a lot of new software,

42:56.156 --> 42:58.158
"stuff that people have
only been talking about,

42:58.242 --> 42:59.910
"and you're gonna do it on this movie."

42:59.994 --> 43:03.956
A liquid metal man
is a big leap from a water snake.

43:04.665 --> 43:07.876
And we had to develop
an entirely new approach

43:07.960 --> 43:12.590
<i>because even though it's not organic,</i>
<i>it is supposed to embody</i>

43:12.965 --> 43:14.508
<i>the characteristics of the T-1000,</i>

43:14.592 --> 43:16.719
<i>which is actually</i>
<i>the actor Robert Patrick.</i>

43:18.846 --> 43:20.681
<i>It was such an exciting opportunity.</i>

43:21.682 --> 43:25.894
You probably could have made <i>The Abyss</i>
without that pseudopod character

43:25.978 --> 43:27.980
and figured out a way to tell the story.

43:28.230 --> 43:31.317
The polyalloy character
in <i>T2</i> had to work, right?

43:31.400 --> 43:33.068
It had to work.

43:34.862 --> 43:38.073
DOUG: <i>We really embraced the risk,</i>
<i>not overpromising,</i>

43:38.157 --> 43:41.827
but knowing just enough to say,
"We will get the answer months from now.

43:41.994 --> 43:44.872
"We don't know what it is now,
but we will find it together."

43:44.955 --> 43:47.291
JAMES: <i>They only had nine months,</i>
<i>which was the scary part</i>

43:47.374 --> 43:48.917
<i>to do these really complicated shots.</i>

43:49.001 --> 43:50.794
They had to create the new technology,

43:50.878 --> 43:53.756
then they had to apply it
and get it done on a schedule.

43:55.174 --> 43:59.887
The process started with Doug Chiang,
who has to first envision that look.

44:00.679 --> 44:04.058
<i>Here's what we want, go.</i>
<i>Go ahead and do it in 3D.</i>

44:05.684 --> 44:08.103
That's where design started
to push the technology,

44:08.187 --> 44:11.940
<i>because I just want to go for the</i>
<i>aesthetics, to come up with these things.</i>

44:12.566 --> 44:15.402
Knowing that there were going
to be many computer graphics people

44:15.486 --> 44:16.695
to figure out how to execute.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.948
STEVE: <i>In this film,</i>
<i>we broke up into five teams.</i>

44:20.866 --> 44:21.867
<i>The one I was on,</i>

44:21.950 --> 44:24.828
we had to figure out
how to build the T-1000 in data.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.790
So I figured,
I'll do the way nature does it.

44:27.873 --> 44:30.584
Start with bones, muscles, tendons,
vacuum wrap it,

44:30.668 --> 44:33.754
and hopefully we get something
that looks like a human.

44:36.298 --> 44:38.967
<i>So we had Robert Patrick come up here.</i>

44:39.218 --> 44:41.929
MARK: <i>He had to stand in this</i>
<i>sort of crucifix device.</i>

44:42.012 --> 44:44.348
<i>We put this grid on his body,</i>

44:45.182 --> 44:48.435
and then we shot lots of stills
to analyze his physical musculature.

44:49.978 --> 44:52.147
STEVE: <i>I wanted to try and mimic his walk,</i>

44:52.231 --> 44:55.234
but this is pre-motion capture,
so we shot him with two

44:55.317 --> 44:59.571
VistaVision division cameras synced
both from the front and from the side.

45:00.531 --> 45:03.659
Mark started being more assistant
visual effects supervisor.

45:03.742 --> 45:04.827
<i>He was on set.</i>

45:05.744 --> 45:10.082
I decided to concentrate
on the Robert Patrick form,

45:10.165 --> 45:12.084
<i>because Robert is the T-1000.</i>

45:12.167 --> 45:14.294
<i>We're gonna study his body.</i>

45:14.378 --> 45:15.796
<i>We're gonna watch his movements.</i>

45:15.879 --> 45:18.549
<i>The way he walks, the way he runs,</i>
<i>the way he behaves.</i>

45:19.675 --> 45:23.387
JIM: <i>We're gonna capture all this stuff</i>
<i>to build a database of his movements.</i>

45:24.346 --> 45:27.015
<i>He had a little tiny bit of a weird gait.</i>

45:27.099 --> 45:29.935
<i>He had a little bit of a limp</i>
<i>that Steve caught</i>

45:30.728 --> 45:32.980
and we kind of replicated it
and put it into

45:33.063 --> 45:35.232
the animation of that character

45:35.315 --> 45:37.609
when he was, you know,
in full polyalloy form.

45:51.081 --> 45:53.751
That's the moment.
That's the moment in history.

45:53.834 --> 45:59.757
<i>We've seen the light and we went</i>
<i>from 16 CG shots on</i> The Abyss <i>to 42</i>

46:00.215 --> 46:04.428
<i>in</i> T2, <i>and we were in this</i>
<i>transitional phase</i>

46:04.511 --> 46:06.638
<i>where we're still doing stuff</i>
<i>of practical effects.</i>

46:06.722 --> 46:11.101
<i>while we were doing stuff with CG</i>
<i>and getting them to meet in the middle.</i>

46:11.185 --> 46:15.939
<i>I brought my friend Stan Winston to do</i>
<i>some of the effects,</i>

46:16.023 --> 46:17.232
<i>the practical gags.</i>

46:22.154 --> 46:23.864
(EXPLOSIONS)

46:27.785 --> 46:30.829
(CHUCKLES) So that was our team.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.416
DOUG: <i>There was a lot of back and forth</i>
<i>to find workarounds.</i>

46:34.500 --> 46:36.794
What are the best tools
to create imageries that we want?

46:36.877 --> 46:41.507
You are limited by technology, but then
you try to find ways to overcome that.

46:42.841 --> 46:45.719
There were things that popped open
on his chest and so on.

46:45.969 --> 46:49.807
So the popping open,
they did it as a physical gag.

46:52.851 --> 46:55.854
The rehealing was in Dennis' camp.

46:56.438 --> 47:00.067
<i>It's kind of hard to tell where one begins</i>
<i>and the other ends at this point.</i>

47:00.692 --> 47:02.694
<i>We had an effect called "sauce head,"</i>

47:02.778 --> 47:05.030
you know, where he gets
his head blown open, right?

47:05.906 --> 47:08.116
<i>We had an incredible collaboration.</i>

47:08.283 --> 47:11.203
<i>How to divide this up</i>
<i>and how to get the lighting to agree</i>

47:11.286 --> 47:15.249
<i>and how to make it look like</i>
<i>it all lives in the same world.</i>

47:16.542 --> 47:18.001
Computer graphics, you know,

47:18.085 --> 47:21.255
you draw your way or animate your way
or render your way out of a problem.

47:25.884 --> 47:27.344
(GASPS)

47:30.597 --> 47:33.225
STEVE: <i>Like in the case of the bars,</i>
<i>they have this great scene</i>

47:33.308 --> 47:35.561
<i>where the T-1000 that's supposed to walk</i>

47:35.644 --> 47:39.731
<i>through a set of static bars,</i>
<i>we had the actual data of the face.</i>

47:41.358 --> 47:42.734
<i>But data is stupid.</i>

47:42.818 --> 47:44.778
If I have two objects
and I smash them together,

47:44.862 --> 47:47.447
they go right through one another
because it doesn't know.

47:48.907 --> 47:52.911
<i>So you have to write a program</i>
<i>that understands how to make one object</i>

47:52.995 --> 47:56.498
collide with the other object
the same way that nature does it.

47:58.208 --> 48:02.004
So when his face walks through,
the program says, "Okay."

48:02.880 --> 48:06.675
<i>When you see face A, run into bars B,</i>

48:06.758 --> 48:10.345
<i>make sure to deform and listen</i>
<i>to what the contour of the bar is.</i>

48:11.388 --> 48:14.474
<i>So it emulates the look of liquid</i>
<i>moving through the bar.</i>

48:19.563 --> 48:20.814
DENNIS: <i>Impossible.</i>

48:21.732 --> 48:23.358
That shot is impossible.

48:23.775 --> 48:26.236
I still look at it and say,
"That's impossible."

48:28.447 --> 48:30.324
<i>Then the gun doesn't go through,</i>

48:31.116 --> 48:34.578
to remind you that it's something special.

48:36.121 --> 48:38.874
STEVEN SPIELBERG: <i>When Jim Cameron did</i>
<i>the second</i> Terminator,

48:40.584 --> 48:44.171
I was so blown away by these shots,
they just stuck with me.

48:47.132 --> 48:50.177
JAMES: <i>The film was ludicrously ambitious,</i>

48:50.260 --> 48:53.013
but the ambitious part
is part of the magic.

48:53.680 --> 48:58.310
<i>You have to be ambitious because you have</i>
<i>to be willing to do the hard work</i>

48:58.393 --> 49:00.896
<i>to show people something</i>
<i>they've never seen before.</i>

49:02.481 --> 49:04.858
<i>T2</i> was just so groundbreaking.

49:04.942 --> 49:10.781
At that point, our department was filled
with the best people in the business.

49:12.616 --> 49:18.747
It was just a matter of time before we
would break out to do something stunning.

49:27.881 --> 49:31.635
<i>After</i> Terminator <i>had finished,</i>
Dennis Muren brought us all out to lunch,

49:31.718 --> 49:34.179
<i>and he said,</i>
<i>"Spielberg has come up with this film."</i>

49:34.262 --> 49:37.891
<i>It's gonna be about dinosaurs</i>
<i>that take over a park.</i>

49:37.975 --> 49:39.893
Phil Tippett's gonna do all the dinosaurs.

49:46.650 --> 49:48.068
<i>And we're just being thrown</i>

49:48.151 --> 49:51.363
into the batch for whatever,
with no idea what we're gonna do.

49:51.613 --> 49:52.990
Mark and I right away said,

49:53.073 --> 49:55.409
"Why don't we build the whole thing
in computer graphics?"

49:56.576 --> 49:58.996
But it didn't seem like
we were ready to commit

49:59.079 --> 50:02.666
to a deadline for a show that big
and much more complicated

50:02.749 --> 50:03.792
than <i>Terminator 2.</i>

50:06.420 --> 50:08.922
STEVE: <i>It became sort of like</i>
<i>a personal challenge.</i>

50:10.716 --> 50:12.509
<i>Mark and I went back to our office,</i>

50:13.760 --> 50:15.679
<i>and I started drawing it on the board.</i>

50:17.514 --> 50:22.394
If you believe in something, you know,
there's nothing worse than not trying.
