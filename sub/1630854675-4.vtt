WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:14.882
Yes. No, that's perfect. Wahoo.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.917
Great. Thank you.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.886
You need to work
on your "wahoo."

00:19.019 --> 00:20.588
What--
What do you mean?

00:20.721 --> 00:21.755
Well, if you're
excited enough

00:21.889 --> 00:23.124
to give something a "wahoo,"

00:23.257 --> 00:24.958
you gotta put
some energy behind it.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.794
- Oh.
- Wahoo!

00:26.927 --> 00:28.262
Well,
I was talking about fish.

00:28.396 --> 00:29.763
- Oh.
- The crew caught

00:29.897 --> 00:31.665
some fresh wahoo today,

00:31.799 --> 00:34.068
and I was thinking
I wanna surprise Javier

00:34.202 --> 00:36.370
with a very special
dinner tonight.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.073
Ah. Well...

00:41.242 --> 00:43.311
A romantic dinner
after a night apart?

00:43.444 --> 00:47.281
I think you might be looking
at a "wahoo" wahoo situation.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.883
One can hope.

00:50.017 --> 00:53.487
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.023
I say we always use
a seaplane for travel.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.425
Well, that could be limiting,

00:57.558 --> 00:59.560
considering we live
in the Midwest.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.462
Damn, my ice bags melted.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.497
What did you bring, mayonnaise?

01:03.631 --> 01:06.167
No, it's all my fancy
skin-care stuff,

01:06.300 --> 01:07.435
which I don't really need,

01:07.568 --> 01:09.703
but the little girl selling it
was so sweet.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.339
Oh.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.674
Old friends?

01:13.807 --> 01:15.509
Yeah, from Minnesota,

01:15.643 --> 01:17.345
here because of another
old friend,

01:17.478 --> 01:18.712
one who disappeared.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.750
Well, ladies,
welcome to Fantasy Island.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.652
I'm your host, Elena Roarke.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.520
This is my associate, Ruby.
- Hi.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.955
Let me introduce you
to Norah Krawczyk,

01:28.088 --> 01:30.191
Judy Jackson,
and Marcia Farrell.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.825
Well,
it is lovely to meet you.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.227
- Nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.296
You two are more beautiful
than the island.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.864
Oh, thank you.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.199
All right, ladies,
if you'll follow me,

01:38.332 --> 01:40.301
Ash will help you get settled.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.703
- Hey.
- Missing you.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.638
Mm, wait until tonight.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.175
Elena, I'm sorry
to do this last-minute.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.909
But plans have changed.

01:49.042 --> 01:52.380
I actually told Helene
I'd take her to the mainland.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.381
Mm.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.249
Oh, that sounds fun.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.050
Where are you going?
- Going shopping.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.686
Now that Helene's gonna be
staying here for a while,

01:58.819 --> 02:00.588
I told her I'd fly her in,
buy some things.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.055
A father-daughter
shopping trip.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.624
Now, that's a good papi
right here.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.326
Yeah. You two have
any tips for me?

02:05.459 --> 02:06.694
If Helene tries something on

02:06.827 --> 02:07.861
and wants to know
what you think,

02:07.995 --> 02:09.029
that means
she already likes it,

02:09.163 --> 02:10.898
so just tell her
that it looks great.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.666
And if you feel the urge
to say,

02:12.800 --> 02:15.236
"Do you really need that?"
just stifle it.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.105
"Looks great." Stifle.
Got it.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.873
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.580
A trip back to the mainland. Hmm.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.516
That'll be good for them.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.019
Something wrong?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.254
No, no.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.922
'Cause I might need you
to come over tonight

02:35.055 --> 02:38.025
and help me eat all that wahoo
that you're talking about.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.864
We all met in the early '80s
in a Jazzercise class.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.600
Picture the three of us
in headbands and leotards.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.603
Rosemarie was our instructor,

02:49.737 --> 02:50.838
and you know the kind of person

02:50.971 --> 02:53.140
who somehow
makes everything brighter?

02:53.274 --> 02:54.508
That was Rosemarie.
- Yep.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.744
And we just became
best friends.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.979
The Fearsome Foursome.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.250
And this is us

03:02.383 --> 03:04.952
about six months
before she disappeared.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.820
You haven't heard
from her since?

03:06.954 --> 03:08.756
- No, not once.
- No.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.592
So tell me.
What can the Island do for you?

03:11.725 --> 03:14.595
Our fantasy
is to find Rosemarie

03:14.728 --> 03:16.564
to finally know
what happened to her.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.732
And you're sure
you're prepared for the answer?

03:18.866 --> 03:21.735
The Island doesn't
guarantee good news.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.237
We just need to know.

03:23.371 --> 03:26.507
I mean, Rosemarie
was just so full of life.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.209
She never judged.
We could tell her anything.

03:29.343 --> 03:32.413
She had that amazing ability
to sort out whatever

03:32.546 --> 03:34.615
was happening with you,
you know what I mean?

03:34.748 --> 03:37.418
And we spent hours together
in her kitchen.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.288
Oh, she had
the coziest kitchen.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.756
And then one day,
we were supposed to meet her

03:42.890 --> 03:44.091
after she finished
teaching her class,

03:44.224 --> 03:45.659
and she just didn't show up.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.296
We couldn't get ahold of her,
so we went to her apartment.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.730
The closet was half empty.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.665
Everything was a mess,
like she left in a big hurry.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.233
I think she was abducted

03:53.367 --> 03:55.703
and somebody tried to make it
look like she ran away.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.606
Norah thinks everything's
a true-crime podcast,

03:58.739 --> 04:01.342
but the police did follow
every lead they had.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.910
And she just disappeared.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.946
Without a trace,
like the show.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.016
And we never stopped
looking for her.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.685
We tried internet searches
and social media,

04:11.819 --> 04:13.454
private detectives.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.289
We even searched death records.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.526
And this week
is Rosemarie's birthday.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.928
That is, assuming that...

04:21.061 --> 04:23.331
- Honey...
- It's not, you know.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.433
We'll always be
the Fearsome Foursome,

04:25.566 --> 04:27.901
but we are all getting older.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.203
And if we're ever gonna find
out what happened to Rosemarie,

04:30.338 --> 04:31.472
we need to do it now.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.673
Before it's too late.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.207
Well, the Island
will see to it

04:34.342 --> 04:36.810
that you all find
exactly what you need.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.412
Now, please come with me.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.781
I'll show you
where you're staying.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.984
Rosemarie's lucky to have
friends like you.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.324
On the other side
of this door,

04:50.458 --> 04:51.525
your fantasy will begin.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.399
- Here we go.
- Oh, my.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.603
Goodness gracious.
- Wow.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.840
Where are we?

05:06.974 --> 05:10.277
I think the question is,
when are we?

05:10.411 --> 05:12.179
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.160
Oh, look.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.962
This is Miami.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.398
Why are we in Miami?

05:30.531 --> 05:31.899
And look at all this neon.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.035
We are definitely
in the '80s.

05:36.370 --> 05:39.106
Ooh, are these ours?

05:39.239 --> 05:41.542
Norah...

05:41.675 --> 05:43.711
you have a room key.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.113
Exciting.

05:46.246 --> 05:48.416
Honey, can you come help us
with our bags, please?

05:48.549 --> 05:50.518
Only one room?

05:50.651 --> 05:52.019
Let hope it's a suite.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.086
Oh, it's all right.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.630
Isn't this
a pretty little bird--

06:02.763 --> 06:04.832
um...

06:04.965 --> 06:07.468
slug?

06:07.601 --> 06:10.638
Anyway,
did Rosemarie ever say anything

06:10.771 --> 06:11.972
about Miami to you?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.107
Not that I recall.
Hey, look.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.276
I forgot how tiny my waist is
with shoulder pads.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.746
I'm bringing the look back.
- Oh, please don't.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.013
How you doing in there?

06:20.147 --> 06:22.583
These clothes
just aren't exactly me.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.253
Va-va-voom!

06:26.386 --> 06:28.321
I feel so ridiculous.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.791
Hank would've died
if he saw me in this thing.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.259
He did die.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.363
And you look fabulous.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.468
Okay...

06:40.601 --> 06:42.436
jellies or Dr. Scholl's?

06:42.570 --> 06:44.605
You used to call jellies
"smellies," remember?

06:44.738 --> 06:47.340
- Dr. Scholl's.
- Hey, look at us.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.942
Charlie's aging angels.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.711
Ooh!

06:52.880 --> 06:54.782
What is that?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.416
It's a valet ticket.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.520
- We have a car?
- Let's ride.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.955
Oh, look. It's manual.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.626
Are you sure you remember
how to drive a stick?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.661
Oh, I'm sure.
It's like riding a bike.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.998
Mm.
A map.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.000
I miss these.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.604
Here's a note from
Elena Roarke wishing us luck.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.539
both: Aw.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.308
There's a marked
location on the map.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.876
Let's go there.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.148
Ooh!
Oopsy-daisy.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.050
Whoa. Yeah, okay.
I got it.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.619
Wait, wait, wait.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.386
Hang on, guys.
- Whoa!

07:33.521 --> 07:35.889
- Hang on, guys.
- Ooh!

07:36.023 --> 07:40.027
- Whee!
- Oh!

07:49.870 --> 07:51.739
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.741
There's something
I need to ask you.

07:53.874 --> 07:56.376
Hmm. Okay.

07:56.510 --> 08:00.013
I already know the answer,
but I need to hear it out loud.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.182
Ask.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.852
I was old and dying,

08:04.985 --> 08:07.755
and the Island
made me young again.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.490
And I'm so, so grateful.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.126
I love being here.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.129
But just seeing Helene

08:16.263 --> 08:19.867
come and go as she pleases...

08:20.000 --> 08:24.037
I mean,
I--I can't do that, can I?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.174
No.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.545
Because I'll die.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.182
Yeah.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.552
That's what I thought.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.123
I'm sorry, Ruby.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.893
It's the price of living here,

08:46.026 --> 08:48.361
of living.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.465
Hmm.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.235
Could be worse.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.342
This is it.

09:02.475 --> 09:05.278
Told you I could do it.
Not even a scratch.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.546
Mm.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.915
A condo.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.917
At least it's not
a graveyard.

09:10.050 --> 09:10.951
Now what do we do?

09:11.084 --> 09:13.587
Look, second-floor balcony.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.822
Gardenias.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.790
You know,
Rosemarie loved gardenias,

09:16.924 --> 09:18.592
and she couldn't grow 'em
in Minnesota.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.328
- She really did ghost us.
- Oh, shush.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.331
I say we go knock on the door
and see what happens.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.767
What?
"Hello, Rosemarie.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.470
"We're from the future, and we
just wanna know you're okay

09:30.604 --> 09:33.006
and ask why the hell
you didn't call us."

09:33.140 --> 09:35.643
Come with me or not.
I'm going up.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.721
Quality fixtures.

09:47.855 --> 09:51.024
You don't see condos like this
on the market these days.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.826
I thought
you only sell houses.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.728
I'm not selling.
Buying, maybe.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.830
Marcia Jean, don't tell me

09:56.964 --> 09:58.966
you're buying condos
for your children.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.433
Well, they can't live
with me forever.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.235
Besides, it's an investment.

10:02.369 --> 10:06.306
Well, you know,
maybe they should just be...

10:06.439 --> 10:07.808
not living with you at all.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.509
They are adults, you know.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.180
I think it should be
that one.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.349
Oh, looks like
somebody broke in.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.687
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.463
It's blood.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.933
Oh, my Lord.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.902
Rosemarie.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.252
But what if we're too late?

10:52.385 --> 10:54.087
What if we came all this way
and she--

10:54.221 --> 10:56.857
Okay, stop. Stop.
We're gonna find her.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.259
Think like a detective.
We need clues.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.761
Marcia, you take the bedroom.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.595
Judy, you take the kitchen.
I'll look in here.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.231
But what are we looking for?

11:04.364 --> 11:06.466
Don't you watch "Dateline,"
"Law Order"?

11:06.599 --> 11:09.903
Anything and everything
gives us information.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.806
We better hurry, 'cause whoever
did this might come back.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.542
Oh, God. Okay.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.090
What are we doing here?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.559
You know, I get cabin fever
myself sometimes.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.761
And I know it's different,

11:33.894 --> 11:35.428
because I can technically
leave the island.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.398
But I understand
what you're feeling,

11:38.531 --> 11:41.101
and I have an idea
that may help.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.303
Shall we?

11:49.242 --> 11:52.079
Welcome to Miami and 1985.

11:54.581 --> 11:58.085
I mean, I don't get it.
Are we gonna go see the ladies?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.253
Think of it
as a short holiday.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.089
You can't leave the island
the traditional way,

12:02.222 --> 12:05.058
but the guests' fantasies
provide a loophole.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.360
It's okay to indulge
now and then, you know?

12:07.494 --> 12:09.329
Oh, wow!

12:09.462 --> 12:12.900
Oh, this--this is amazing.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.502
The '80s were my jam.

12:15.635 --> 12:19.339
Well, here's some money
and a room key...

12:19.472 --> 12:21.108
just in case.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.679
Go have a bitchin' time.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.615
I'll meet you here at sunrise.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.151
I feel like Cinderella.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.686
Guess that makes you
my fairy godmother.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.690
Boom.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.893
Hi.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.661
Oh.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.873
It's not a robbery.
All her jewelry is still here.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.641
Mm, good detective work.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.277
Judy, are you eating?

12:57.410 --> 13:00.213
Mm, you know,
when I'm anxious, I eat.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.882
It's those cheesy, fluffy

13:02.015 --> 13:04.885
gourmet pastries
that Rosemarie used to love.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.786
I had forgotten about these.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.890
Are the pastries fresh?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.892
Definitely fresh.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.526
What about the sink?
Is it wet?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.062
The coffee maker warm?

13:15.195 --> 13:17.330
Sink, yes.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.333
Coffee maker... barely.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.536
Whatever happened here
happened today.

13:23.670 --> 13:26.439
Closet and dressers
are still full.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.076
You guys, I don't get it.
Rosemarie taught Jazzercise.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.577
How can she afford all this?

13:30.710 --> 13:32.279
I'm beginning
to figure that out,

13:32.412 --> 13:35.182
and I don't think
we're gonna like the answers.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.750
Routing numbers.
Account ledgers.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.587
Business cards
in multiple names.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.856
I don't understand it,
but it looks shady.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.724
It's a real estate scam.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.726
- Hmm?
- You sure?

13:46.860 --> 13:47.895
From what I can tell,

13:48.028 --> 13:50.197
Rosemarie posed
as a selling agent

13:50.330 --> 13:52.199
for empty
commercial properties.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.067
And when they gave her a check
for the down payment,

13:54.201 --> 13:57.604
she cashed it under a fake name
and then just moved on.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.106
And that works?

13:59.239 --> 14:01.708
It did in the '80s
before electronic banking.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.277
- So she's a con artist.
- She's a criminal.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.979
This is big and complicated.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.280
She has a partner.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.749
That's why she didn't judge
our little sins.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.985
Maybe that is why
she left Minnesota.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.887
She was doing something
illegal there,

14:14.021 --> 14:15.788
and she wanted to leave
before she got caught.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.291
Maybe she was even
trying to con us.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.293
We've worried about her
all these years.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.963
Turns out, we have no idea
who she really was.

14:23.096 --> 14:26.366
But Rosemarie was our friend.
We have to find her.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.002
I have an idea.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.243
You remember redial?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.311
You push the pound key,

14:38.445 --> 14:41.148
and the phone dials the last
number that Rosemarie called.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.516
Hey, guys.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.720
Hey, you guys, there's a guy
outside, and he's got--

14:47.854 --> 14:48.989
<i>Hello, you've reached
Marcia Farrell.</i>

14:49.122 --> 14:50.457
<i>You know what to do.</i>

14:54.027 --> 14:57.164
That is your old
answering machine.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.500
Rosemarie called you?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.173
Marcia, what is going on?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.640
We can't talk
about this right now.

15:07.774 --> 15:08.875
There's a man outside.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.577
I think he's looking for us,
and he has a gun.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.645
- A g--
- A gun?

15:12.779 --> 15:13.780
Hurry.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.016
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.117
He'll take the elevator.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.486
We should go back
to the stairs.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.021
You're not getting out
of this.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.622
Judy, could your shoes
be any louder?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.191
Y'all told me to wear these.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.629
Are you sure you saw someone?

15:31.831 --> 15:33.967
That's him.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.705
Come on.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.661
Run!

16:11.138 --> 16:13.373
There he is.
Go! Go! Go!

16:18.511 --> 16:20.980
Let's party.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.250
Let's have some fun. Whoo-hoo!

16:29.322 --> 16:31.524
Hey, where are you going?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.093
We're gonna dance
the night way.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.095
Wanna come?

16:35.228 --> 16:39.099
- Why not? Yeah.
- Ahh!

16:53.680 --> 16:54.981
I think I lost him.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.085
Okay... talk.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.422
Rosemarie called me once.
She asked for money.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.790
I told her
I wouldn't send her a dime

17:03.923 --> 17:05.225
unless she'd tell me
what the hell was happening

17:05.358 --> 17:07.627
and where she was,
and then she hung up.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.761
Why didn't you tell us?

17:08.895 --> 17:10.297
Well, I thought
she'd call back

17:10.430 --> 17:11.998
and then I'd talk to her
and tell y'all everything.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.401
But then she didn't,
and I waited so long,

17:14.534 --> 17:15.968
it was impossible to tell you.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.871
- And why didn't she call me?
- No offense, Judy.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.373
Marcia may be bossy,

17:20.507 --> 17:23.476
but she's not afraid of dealing
with the hard things,

17:23.610 --> 17:25.578
unless the hard things
are her children.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.180
I am not bossy,

17:27.314 --> 17:30.183
and I handle things
with my children just fine.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.951
And I'm not afraid
of hard things.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.153
Your husband dies,

17:33.286 --> 17:35.755
and within days,
you're full steam ahead,

17:35.888 --> 17:39.292
joining book clubs
and extension classes.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.094
What is the point
of wallowing?

17:41.228 --> 17:42.862
I like to stay busy.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.697
Your life is so boring

17:44.831 --> 17:47.467
that you get your kicks
from other people's deaths.

17:49.202 --> 17:52.105
Who says I'm bossy?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.573
Everybody.

17:53.706 --> 17:57.177
The only people you don't tell
what to do are your kids.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.312
- Hmm.
- Solving mysteries

17:59.446 --> 18:01.681
is an exercise for the brain,

18:01.814 --> 18:03.716
and would one of you
look at this map?

18:03.850 --> 18:06.586
I have no idea
how to get back to the hotel.

18:18.498 --> 18:22.869
So no Ruby, no Javier,

18:23.002 --> 18:26.273
not even your old dog,
Mr. Jones.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.875
You must be feeling
a little lonely.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.710
Not at all.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.213
I am actually
enjoying the quiet.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.549
- Elenita.
- I'm serious.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.050
You remember when I first
came to the island.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.952
I was always alone.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.554
I'm used to it, Segundo.

18:41.688 --> 18:45.725
When you first came,
you were an island, but now--

18:45.858 --> 18:48.895
- Don't say a people person.
- I wouldn't dare.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.332
I simply respect
people's needs.

18:53.266 --> 18:56.469
Ruby needed a little adventure
to recharge.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.505
We all need to recharge sometimes.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.340
Yeah.
And Javier and Helene,

19:00.473 --> 19:03.376
they need some time alone
together so they--

19:03.510 --> 19:05.378
they can bond.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.846
And what about you?

19:07.847 --> 19:09.349
What do you need?

19:12.018 --> 19:14.721
You, me, the ocean.

19:14.854 --> 19:15.922
That's enough.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.525
Don't fool me
with your flattery.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.427
You are changing, Elena.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.295
You are letting people in.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.531
Mm.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.998
Maybe.

19:26.132 --> 19:29.001
Which means
that when they are not here,

19:29.135 --> 19:31.037
you are a bit lonely.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.940
You are annoyingly wise.
You know that?

19:34.073 --> 19:36.709
I just know a lot
about islands.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.580
What about you?

19:40.713 --> 19:42.849
Do you ever get lonely?

19:42.982 --> 19:44.584
Nah.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.486
Once in a while,

19:46.619 --> 19:50.990
it might be nice
to talk to people my own age.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.659
Ruby's your age.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.895
You expect me to talk
to someone in that body

19:56.028 --> 19:58.030
about compression socks?

19:58.164 --> 20:00.900
Why would you talk to anybody
about compression socks?

20:01.033 --> 20:04.003
Well...

20:06.205 --> 20:07.840
All I'm saying is that when
your husband said he wanted

20:07.974 --> 20:09.542
to move to a golf community
full of old people,

20:09.676 --> 20:10.877
you should have said,
"Hell no."

20:11.010 --> 20:12.712
Because you did
such a bang-up job

20:12.845 --> 20:14.714
being happily married
to your husband.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.883
Can we please stop talking
about husbands?

20:17.016 --> 20:18.084
Because mine is dead.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.852
Yet you say you're fine.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.321
<i>♪ You know them ♪</i>

20:21.454 --> 20:24.123
<i>♪ You see them all ♪</i>

20:24.257 --> 20:25.458
<i>♪ 'Cause they all come
out at night ♪</i>

20:25.592 --> 20:27.126
What is going on?

20:27.260 --> 20:28.495
Ladies!

20:28.628 --> 20:31.298
Oh, my--hi.
How's your fantasy?

20:31.431 --> 20:33.266
- Terrible.
- Oh.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.268
Rosemarie
has disappeared again,

20:35.402 --> 20:36.936
and all we're doing
is fighting.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.172
Why don't we split up
and I will go find her myself?

20:40.307 --> 20:41.608
- Fine.
- Come on, now.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.343
You've been friends
for half your lives.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.345
You can't just
abandon each other now.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.850
Maybe we should
take a chill pill.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.019
- It's the '80s thing to do.
- Mm-hmm.

20:53.152 --> 20:56.623
Rad.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.259
There is a lot of people
wearing purple tonight.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.494
We're from Minneapolis.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.130
We know what purple means.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.698
all: Prince?

21:05.832 --> 21:08.368
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, we're in Miami.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.802
It's 1985.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.070
Okay, I have somewhere to be.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.039
So you ladies,
please stick together.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.474
Promise me.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.475
- We will.
- Okay.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.476
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.345
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.379
- Oh, my God.
- Excuse me.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.513
Excuse me.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.889
Excuse me. Excuse me.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.660
Excuse me.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.528
Marcia?

21:37.697 --> 21:38.698
Norah!

21:40.900 --> 21:42.702
Judy.

21:42.835 --> 21:46.973
<i>♪ But now
you are in the way ♪</i>

21:47.106 --> 21:48.875
<i>♪ Can't see clearly ♪</i>

21:51.177 --> 21:52.912
Rosemarie!

21:53.980 --> 21:56.383
Rosemarie.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.518
No, wait!

22:05.157 --> 22:06.626
Rosemarie!

22:15.234 --> 22:16.268
Rosemarie!

22:17.837 --> 22:19.338
Rosemarie!

22:34.086 --> 22:35.588
Rosemarie.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.624
You're okay.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.759
I've been waiting for you.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.662
Oh, my God.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.132
Pastries?

22:54.641 --> 22:56.609
I don't want a pastry.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.745
I wanna know where you've been.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.615
And I want a hug.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.884
- Oh, honey, come here.
- Oh.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.819
But where have you been?

23:06.953 --> 23:08.655
I wanna talk about you.

23:08.788 --> 23:12.091
Look at this dress.
Very "Dynasty."

23:12.224 --> 23:14.427
Sure you don't want a pastry?
They have the cheese.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.296
This is not about the cheese.
You lied to me.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.832
You said you were my friend,
and then you left.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.602
- Judy, you're angry.
- Of course I'm angry.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.704
You don't just abandon
people you love.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.839
You don't just leave.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.875
I understand, honey,

23:29.008 --> 23:30.877
but it's not me
you're angry at.

23:35.615 --> 23:36.949
Here.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.985
What is this for?

23:41.521 --> 23:43.022
You're going to need it.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.994
You have no idea
how guilty I've felt.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.596
For what?

23:49.729 --> 23:51.531
For asking all those
questions when you called.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.633
I should've just shut up
and tried to help.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.636
Helping isn't the only way
to show love, Marcia.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.204
You believe that, right?

23:58.337 --> 23:59.906
- I guess.
- Listen to me.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.342
You don't deserve to feel
one bit guilty about me

24:03.476 --> 24:04.977
or about your kids.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.345
My kids?

24:06.479 --> 24:08.314
What do they
have to do with anything?

24:09.782 --> 24:12.084
Let me get us some coffee.

24:13.553 --> 24:14.587
Thank you.

24:14.721 --> 24:17.189
I don't blame you
for being a criminal.

24:17.323 --> 24:19.859
Sounds so exciting.

24:19.992 --> 24:24.130
Are you forgetting the
shattered table and the blood?

24:24.263 --> 24:27.500
I just feel so boring
next to you.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.670
Boring or bored?
There's a difference.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.207
Can I admit something...

24:35.341 --> 24:36.909
pretty terrible about myself?

24:37.043 --> 24:39.378
Your secret's safe with me.

24:41.147 --> 24:45.184
Your disappearance
was awful...

24:45.317 --> 24:47.086
but it was also
the most exciting thing

24:47.219 --> 24:49.789
that has ever happened to me.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.925
Maybe it's time
you changed that.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.495
It's not fair.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.464
There you go, honey.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.200
How can he do this?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.402
We had plans.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.237
Good girl.

25:05.371 --> 25:08.007
I am angry. I am so angry.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.009
I'm angry at Hank.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.111
How could he leave me
like this?

25:17.850 --> 25:19.886
You've been divorced
over 20 years now, right?

25:20.019 --> 25:20.953
Mm-hmm.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.454
And yet you still
feel guilty,

25:22.589 --> 25:24.691
like you exploded your kids'
lives into a million pieces.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.458
I don't.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.962
Oh, God, do I?

25:30.096 --> 25:32.565
Maybe that's why
you can't say no to them.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.433
I--

25:34.567 --> 25:37.770
You know, you said something
once, I remember,

25:37.904 --> 25:40.472
about how it was more important
to love yourself

25:40.607 --> 25:42.742
than be loved by any man.

25:44.911 --> 25:48.280
It was bad enough when
my husband stopped loving me,

25:48.414 --> 25:51.684
but I had to leave
before I stopped loving myself.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.086
You made the right decision, Marcia,

25:54.220 --> 25:57.123
and now you need to let it go.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.995
Well, it's just
that my husband is so happy

26:03.129 --> 26:05.632
being retired
and playing golf all day.

26:05.765 --> 26:08.167
I hate it.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.838
I feel like I'm literally
boring myself to death.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.675
I've lived my life
doing everything

26:15.808 --> 26:17.677
I was expected to do.

26:19.011 --> 26:19.979
And now--

26:20.112 --> 26:22.782
You feel like
you haven't lived.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.986
Feel better?

26:29.555 --> 26:33.292
I do, at least a little.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.328
It's okay to be mad at Hank
for dying.

26:36.462 --> 26:38.397
He'd understand.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.333
He was one of the good ones.

26:41.467 --> 26:44.136
I wish I'd met someone
like him instead of--

26:44.270 --> 26:46.038
never mind.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.540
Oh, wait, now...

26:48.675 --> 26:49.709
you broke up with somebody

26:49.842 --> 26:51.477
right before
you moved to Minnesota,

26:51.610 --> 26:53.245
and you wouldn't wanna
talk about him very much.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.014
And his name was...

26:55.147 --> 26:57.383
Bob, Brad?

26:57.516 --> 26:59.952
- Bill.
- Oh, uh-huh.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.654
Not one of the good ones.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.723
Mm.

27:03.856 --> 27:04.857
What are these called?

27:04.991 --> 27:06.959
Ensaimadas.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.130
You're the one who introduced
me to these, remember?

27:11.263 --> 27:13.666
You took me
to that global food fair.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.336
Yes, and you became obsessed.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.337
You searched till you found

27:18.470 --> 27:20.106
the best Filipino bakery
in town.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.841
And pretty soon,
I was going so often,

27:21.974 --> 27:23.542
I made friends with the baker.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.580
I should go now.

27:28.715 --> 27:31.684
- Well, no, not yet.
- I have to.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.585
He's looking for me.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.055
- Who, Bill?
- Wait.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.525
Rosemarie?

27:47.333 --> 27:48.267
You saw Rosemarie.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.601
all: Yes.

27:49.736 --> 27:53.072
- Was that really her?
- It was a version of her.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.975
You see, the Island
is uncovering your memories,

27:56.108 --> 27:59.078
clarifying your perceptions,
not only of Rosemarie

27:59.211 --> 28:00.446
but of yourselves.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.048
As for Rosemarie,

28:02.181 --> 28:04.483
perhaps you're starting to see
who she really is

28:04.616 --> 28:06.452
and not who you want her to be.

28:06.585 --> 28:09.655
Now that I've seen her,
I miss her even more.

28:09.789 --> 28:10.723
She just had a way of getting

28:10.857 --> 28:11.824
to the heart of things,
you know?

28:11.958 --> 28:12.925
- Yeah.
- Yes.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.593
So what do we do now?

28:14.727 --> 28:16.195
I know.

28:16.328 --> 28:19.198
We take what we've learned,
and we create an evidence board

28:19.331 --> 28:20.967
like they do
on the crime shows.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.669
Not a crazy one like the one
that Carrie made in "Homeland."

28:23.803 --> 28:26.072
Remember Saul's face
when he saw that thing?

28:26.205 --> 28:28.240
You know, Mandy Patinkin
is so attractive.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.641
Are you with me on that?

28:29.776 --> 28:31.643
He has always
reminded me of Hank.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.780
- Oh, I see it.
- Don't you?

28:33.913 --> 28:36.115
Hey, we have work to do.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.117
Elena, do--what...

28:40.086 --> 28:42.121
Okay,
I'm gonna go downstairs

28:42.254 --> 28:44.456
to the front desk
and get some supplies.

28:44.590 --> 28:48.928
You two start thinking
about an evidence board,

28:49.061 --> 28:50.897
not Mandy Patinkin.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.134
Well, he is cute.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.810
Oh, my God.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.512
Look how excited you are.

29:06.645 --> 29:07.947
Who are we waiting for?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.548
Your boyfriend?

29:09.681 --> 29:10.883
Gasp.

29:11.017 --> 29:11.984
Your girlfriend?

29:12.118 --> 29:13.619
Okay, I don't even

29:13.752 --> 29:16.856
really have someone
like that right now.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.191
But you do have your eye
on someone, don't you?

29:19.325 --> 29:21.994
I can tell, the way you blush.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.495
Give me her name.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.334
Isla, but I don't even know
if she's interested.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.870
So go find out, girl.
What are you waiting for?

29:31.003 --> 29:32.371
Life is short.

29:32.504 --> 29:35.307
Yeah, it is,

29:35.441 --> 29:36.843
even when it's long.

29:36.976 --> 29:40.212
Okay, Yoda.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.549
Now, would you tell me what
the hell this big secret is?

29:43.682 --> 29:46.652
What I can tell you is,
somewhere in this room

29:46.785 --> 29:48.387
is a reporter
for "Rolling Stone."

29:48.520 --> 29:51.290
And tomorrow he's gonna write
about the best guitar solo

29:51.423 --> 29:52.791
he's ever heard.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.427
'Cause he came in for a drink
after the stadium concert,

29:55.561 --> 29:58.197
no clue that the best set
of the night

29:58.330 --> 29:59.665
was gonna be right here

29:59.798 --> 30:01.267
in a room of 30 people,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.002
and a mom in Ohio
with three little kids

30:03.135 --> 30:04.336
is gonna read about it

30:04.470 --> 30:06.372
and wish that she'd been here
to hear it,

30:06.505 --> 30:08.674
and now she is.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.342
Pardon me.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.913
- Oh!
- Oh, my God. That's Prince!

30:14.046 --> 30:16.748
Wahoo!

30:23.289 --> 30:24.656
Hey!

30:24.790 --> 30:27.059
Ooh. Oh, my God.
It's that guy. Open the door.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.560
Stop!

30:30.362 --> 30:31.697
Come here.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.769
I can't believe
that actually worked.

30:38.704 --> 30:39.872
Ow.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.740
Not really.

30:42.708 --> 30:45.044
No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no. No, please.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.280
Agent Nicholas Vargas. FBI.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.184
I totally should have
seen that coming.

30:56.923 --> 30:59.391
Okay. Here.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.393
And again,
I'm so sorry about this.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.030
I'm confused. The women
in this photograph, they--

31:04.163 --> 31:05.297
Our daughters.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.199
Our daughters
are friends with Rosemarie.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.535
Best friends, from Minnesota.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.203
And you three came
all the way to Miami to look

31:11.337 --> 31:12.804
for your daughters' friend?

31:12.939 --> 31:14.106
Did she steal from you?

31:14.240 --> 31:17.243
No, look, we know
that Rosemarie is involved

31:17.376 --> 31:21.147
in some less-than-honorable
activities.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.316
But we love her, and we're
afraid that she's in danger.

31:24.450 --> 31:28.454
Now, there was this guy
she dated,

31:28.587 --> 31:29.922
Bill something.

31:30.056 --> 31:33.292
- Bill. Forgot all about Bill.
- Mm-hmm.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.261
Yeah, Bill.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.795
His name is Bill Reina.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.397
He's wanted in four states.

31:38.530 --> 31:39.631
That's bad.

31:39.765 --> 31:40.799
We've been onto Reina
for a while.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.935
We think your daughters' friend
got away,

31:43.069 --> 31:44.636
but she's going
to spend the rest of her life

31:44.770 --> 31:46.838
on the run or in jail.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.440
I have an idea.

31:48.574 --> 31:53.279
If Rosemarie is as important
to your case as it sounds like,

31:53.412 --> 31:55.081
you're gonna cut her a deal.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.483
I can't cut a deal
if she's MIA.

31:58.584 --> 32:03.122
I think we know
where we might find her.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.828
Where is Ruby?

32:09.962 --> 32:12.198
I want to hear
about her adventure.

32:12.331 --> 32:13.699
She's still in Miami.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.134
I have to pick her up
in the morning.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.036
She will be out all night?

32:17.169 --> 32:19.838
Trust me,
I doubt I'll be able to sleep.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.441
That must be what it feels like
having a teenager.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.044
I'm sure you can talk
to Javier about that.

32:25.177 --> 32:28.947
Watching him attempt
to be chill with Helene

32:29.081 --> 32:31.984
is becoming
one of my favorite hobbies.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.055
What is it?

32:38.090 --> 32:41.060
You know, Segundo,
what you said earlier,

32:41.193 --> 32:43.162
asking what I need.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.764
You know, I haven't wanted
to get in the way of Javier

32:45.897 --> 32:46.999
getting close
to his daughter,

32:47.133 --> 32:50.236
so I've been trying
to keep my distance.

32:50.369 --> 32:54.206
And now you are worried
you are getting too distant.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.974
Yes.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.510
Have you talked to Javier
about this?

32:58.644 --> 33:00.079
No, no, no, no. It's--

33:00.212 --> 33:04.783
Elenita, you have to be
honest with him.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.352
That's the only way.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.554
You know this.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.758
You're right,

33:12.891 --> 33:13.925
as always.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.098
You know, I just thought
of something nice

33:19.231 --> 33:21.400
that I can do for you.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.736
As long as I don't end up
back in the '80s.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.773
Polyester gives me a rash.

33:27.906 --> 33:30.376
Oh, Segundo.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.918
Oh, my gosh.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.187
Oh, my gosh,

33:41.320 --> 33:43.855
you will not believe
the night I've had.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.424
I can't wait
to hear about it.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.193
I want you to meet
some of my new friends.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.894
Okay.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.797
Oh.
They're busy.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.765
Hmm.
Let's go home.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.834
I have someone I wanna see.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.106
Hmm.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.442
This is--yeah.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.311
Hi.
- Hi.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.613
We're looking for this woman.
Have you seen her?

34:10.716 --> 34:12.951
No. Never seen her.

34:13.085 --> 34:17.156
You make the best ensaimadas
in Miami.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.424
You've seen her.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.027
She was here yesterday,
wasn't she?

34:23.329 --> 34:26.332
It's okay if you're trying
to protect her.

34:26.465 --> 34:27.866
So are we.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.868
We think Rosemarie
was planning

34:30.001 --> 34:32.438
on leaving her boyfriend
and he found out.

34:32.571 --> 34:35.574
He's a bad man, and she won't
be able to hide for long.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.075
She's in danger.

34:37.209 --> 34:39.811
Please, what's inside this
envelope can save her life.

34:39.945 --> 34:42.648
If you see her,
will you make sure she gets it?

34:46.152 --> 34:49.888
If I knew somebody
named Rosemarie,

34:50.021 --> 34:51.290
I would.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.661
Thank you.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.029
Okay.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.233
Oh, no.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.335
This can't be the end.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.705
We didn't find her.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.874
We don't even know
if she got our message.

35:09.007 --> 35:10.542
I did.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.313
Oh!

35:14.446 --> 35:16.548
Ladies, allow me
to reintroduce you

35:16.682 --> 35:19.117
to your good friend Rosemarie.

35:19.251 --> 35:22.254
Rose.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.265
Isla?

35:35.701 --> 35:37.002
You here?

35:39.371 --> 35:41.207
Isla!

35:43.008 --> 35:44.376
Ruby?

35:49.448 --> 35:50.882
Wow.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.285
You look--

35:53.419 --> 35:56.522
you're vibrating
or something.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.457
What's going on?

36:06.832 --> 36:08.600
Where did that come from?

36:08.734 --> 36:10.936
I experienced something
last night,

36:11.069 --> 36:15.874
something magical,
and I don't mean Island Magic.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.844
I mean human,
flesh-and-blood magic.

36:18.977 --> 36:23.982
And if I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life here on this island,

36:24.115 --> 36:26.318
I want more of that,

36:26.452 --> 36:30.556
flesh-and-blood magic.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.542
I don't know
how you found me.

36:50.676 --> 36:54.313
The gardenias...
and the ensaimadas.

36:55.814 --> 37:00.185
I can't believe you remember
such small things about me.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.421
We remember everything
about you.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.023
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

37:06.124 --> 37:07.659
You saved my life.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.161
Is Bill the reason
you left Minnesota?

37:10.296 --> 37:12.230
- He tracked me down.
- Mm.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.099
I left with him
as fast as I could

37:14.232 --> 37:17.102
before he found out anything
about the three of you.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.437
It was safer that way.

37:18.570 --> 37:22.308
You disappeared
to protect us?

37:22.441 --> 37:24.943
So in Miami,
when you got the letter--

37:25.076 --> 37:28.347
I called Agent Vargas
just like you said.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.483
I testified against Bill
in exchange for immunity.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.019
So Bill got prison.
What about you?

37:34.152 --> 37:35.454
I changed my name,

37:35.587 --> 37:37.689
became a physical therapist.
- Hmm.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.325
Got married.
- Kids?

37:39.458 --> 37:40.559
Three.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.294
Five grandkids.

37:42.428 --> 37:45.364
Oh, Rosemarie,
why didn't you reach out to us?

37:45.497 --> 37:46.665
I was ashamed.

37:46.798 --> 37:50.436
I admired you three so much.

37:50.569 --> 37:53.839
You showed me the kind
of person I wanted to be,

37:53.972 --> 37:55.841
the kind of life
I wanted to live.

37:55.974 --> 37:59.144
I was afraid that if
you knew the real me--

37:59.277 --> 38:02.881
We do know the real you,
and we love you.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.885
The Fearsome Foursome.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.922
God, how I've missed you.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.825
I trust you're enjoying
your visit together.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.362
It's glorious.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.996
So much to catch up on.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.498
- Yes.
- Oh, there's no rush.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.367
You are all invited to spend

38:21.500 --> 38:23.402
the rest of the week
together here on the island.

38:23.535 --> 38:24.803
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

38:24.936 --> 38:27.906
And later you come visit us
in Minnesota.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.508
There'll be plenty of room,

38:29.641 --> 38:31.677
because all my kids
are moving out,

38:31.810 --> 38:34.245
and they're even gonna pay
their own rent.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.714
Oh!

38:35.847 --> 38:37.549
And you can be
the guest of honor

38:37.683 --> 38:40.118
at my murder mystery
dinner party.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.389
Albert can go play golf
with his friends.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.056
I am starting a business.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.325
And I expect you all

38:47.459 --> 38:52.063
to come to the memorial service
that I'm planning for Hank.

38:52.197 --> 38:55.767
I couldn't face it before, but...

38:55.901 --> 38:56.935
I can now.

38:57.068 --> 38:58.937
Oh!

38:59.070 --> 39:00.739
- Oh, my God.
- Well, when you finish brunch,

39:00.872 --> 39:03.442
I have arranged something
special for you ladies.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.210
My good friend Segundo,
he's been the caretaker

39:05.343 --> 39:07.946
of the island for--
well, many, many years.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.615
- Is he single?
- Oh!

39:09.748 --> 39:12.384
He is, actually.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.152
Later this afternoon,
he's gonna give you a tour

39:14.285 --> 39:15.854
of the island's flora,

39:15.987 --> 39:18.056
followed by refreshments
at the cocktail bar.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.358
- That sounds wonderful.
- It does.

39:20.492 --> 39:24.430
By the way, the subject of
compression socks may come up.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.698
Enjoy the afternoon.

39:26.832 --> 39:30.402
- Thank you.
- I'm so glad we found you.

39:30.536 --> 39:32.904
Yeah, likewise.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.975
Oh.

39:37.108 --> 39:38.477
I didn't know you were back.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.847
- Just got in.
- Oh, I missed you so much.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.314
Mm.

39:43.449 --> 39:44.750
And guess what.
- What?

39:44.883 --> 39:46.885
I liked it.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.457
You know, I was thinking
that maybe it's time for me

39:51.590 --> 39:53.725
to start getting to know
Helene a little better.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.094
I mean, if it's fine with you.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.730
Yes. Yes, I'd like that.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.499
I just--I haven't wanted
to push, because I know

40:00.632 --> 40:03.769
it can be hard for you
to let people get close.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.837
Mm.

40:05.971 --> 40:08.139
Close, you're saying?

40:08.273 --> 40:09.875
Tell me more about that.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.878
You know, better yet,
I want you to show me.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.347
Mm.
