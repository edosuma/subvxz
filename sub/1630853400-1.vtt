00:29.833 --> 00:33.166
Could I ask you for a cig--

00:34.625 --> 00:35.791
cigarette?

00:36.333 --> 00:38.791
God bless you with kids.

00:39.541 --> 00:42.083
BASED ON THE BOOK
BY MARCIN "KALI" GUTKOWSKI

00:42.166 --> 00:44.500
God bless you once more.

00:44.583 --> 00:45.916
Good luck, man.

00:51.041 --> 00:53.666
<i>Someone found a corpse of a young woman.</i>

00:53.750 --> 00:55.875
<i>Can you go to the crime scene?</i>

00:55.958 --> 00:57.916
We're very busy.

00:59.541 --> 01:00.750
Just kidding.

01:00.833 --> 01:01.666
<i>Bye.</i>

01:03.583 --> 01:04.916
What are you doing?

01:06.583 --> 01:07.500
Siren.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.666
Freeze! Police!

01:12.250 --> 01:13.208
Catch him!

01:21.375 --> 01:23.250
Freeze or I'll shoot!

01:34.375 --> 01:35.291
Freeze!

01:41.833 --> 01:42.750
Freeze!

02:09.541 --> 02:11.208
I'll shoot. Drop it.

02:14.625 --> 02:15.666
It's just a purse.

02:16.541 --> 02:19.875
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY.

02:27.583 --> 02:28.416
Freeze!

02:42.166 --> 02:44.625
Puke and turn back slowly

02:44.708 --> 02:46.291
so I can see your hands.

02:48.625 --> 02:49.833
Yes, sir.

02:49.916 --> 02:51.166
Drop the bag.

02:55.458 --> 02:56.583
Freeze! Police!

03:03.958 --> 03:06.583
God help me. Surrounded by idiots!

04:23.833 --> 04:26.416
Here's my ugly bro.

04:29.291 --> 04:30.500
Are you crazy?

04:31.208 --> 04:33.250
Get dressed, and we're out.

04:33.791 --> 04:35.500
We're out? Are you crazy?

04:36.458 --> 04:39.833
-Where do you wanna go?
-To Kosmaty. To the club.

04:39.916 --> 04:41.250
I'm not going anywhere.

04:41.875 --> 04:46.125
Stop whining and put your kicks on.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.208
-We gotta celebrate.
-Yeah?

04:50.750 --> 04:51.625
What?

04:55.541 --> 04:57.375
Look at the polo shirt I bought!

04:58.625 --> 05:00.458
Check it out.

05:03.291 --> 05:04.500
Nice, bro.

05:07.833 --> 05:10.291
Matches your sweet six-pack.

05:12.666 --> 05:14.000
Admire your prince!

05:27.750 --> 05:31.708
What the fuck, Picasso?
You're not gonna share?

05:31.791 --> 05:32.625
Here.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.291
What is this shit?

05:44.125 --> 05:46.708
-Fluorescent tube dust?
-What?

05:57.791 --> 05:58.916
Kamila!

06:00.166 --> 06:01.750
Wake up!

06:03.166 --> 06:04.583
Mommy…

06:04.666 --> 06:08.416
Stop crying and sort yourself out

06:08.500 --> 06:11.458
or you'll fail your finals
and end up like…

06:31.291 --> 06:32.541
Here's my daughter.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.333
-Morning, daddy.
-You look lovely.

06:35.416 --> 06:36.291
Thank you.

06:40.583 --> 06:41.708
Is your exam today?

06:44.416 --> 06:45.416
Daddy?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.625
Did you ask at the club?

06:50.500 --> 06:52.333
Yeah. I mean, what club?

06:52.916 --> 06:54.041
I'll wait in the car.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.916
You're messing with me.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.166
It's my 18th birthday.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.291
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:06.416 --> 07:07.250
And?

07:07.750 --> 07:12.625
I talked to the manager yesterday.
Everything is taken care of.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.541
What about the car?

07:21.666 --> 07:23.291
A little car for the little one.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.500
-Okay.
-You're going?

07:29.583 --> 07:30.708
I have to.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.208
I'd love a red one.

07:35.708 --> 07:37.500
It's my dream.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.250
I love you.

07:46.958 --> 07:48.083
Did you study?

07:52.791 --> 07:54.000
Patryk?

07:54.750 --> 07:56.625
A friend from work.

07:56.708 --> 07:58.500
But you're not working.

07:59.541 --> 08:01.791
-Daddy would be--
-Mind your words.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.708
Did you really forget?

08:39.833 --> 08:41.250
Are we besties?

08:47.375 --> 08:49.791
-Today is Klaudia's deathday.
-Stop it.

09:12.166 --> 09:13.875
What's so funny, sluts?

09:14.875 --> 09:17.833
Stop talking and relax a bit.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.625
Stick that finger up your Mariana Trench.

09:24.708 --> 09:25.750
Out.

09:26.708 --> 09:29.708
We'd better go. It stinks in here.

09:35.916 --> 09:37.458
They totally tick me off.

09:38.750 --> 09:39.958
What trench?

09:42.416 --> 09:43.791
What's new with you?

09:43.875 --> 09:44.958
Look what I've got.

09:48.666 --> 09:51.583
-Where did you get that?
-From my brother.

09:51.666 --> 09:53.083
It has a nice kick.

09:53.875 --> 09:55.750
-Who's first?
-Let's do it.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.250
Wait.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.375
Let's go.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.291
-Fuck.
-Time to do some shopping.

10:14.916 --> 10:18.166
What the fuck happened last night?
I'm all fucking sore!

10:18.250 --> 10:19.500
I hardly remember.

10:22.875 --> 10:27.125
You were at the bar with the hussy
and picked up a fight with three guys.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.333
-We're going.
-I'm talking.

10:29.416 --> 10:31.541
-Get lost.
-I'll smash your face, bitch.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.291
And you, shut the fuck up.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.833
-Come on!
-And who are you? My guardian?

10:36.916 --> 10:40.125
-Let's fuck him up.
-Fuck you. I can handle it myself.

10:42.416 --> 10:45.041
-With who?
-With who…

10:46.708 --> 10:48.625
Kruszor. Miki. Pieszczoch.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.500
Are you insane?
They rule half of the city.

10:59.208 --> 11:02.583
-Fuck them.
-They'll fuck you.

11:16.833 --> 11:19.708
Do you remember Marta, the nurse?

11:20.291 --> 11:22.500
How could I not?

11:28.166 --> 11:30.333
I promised to go with her
for an ultrasound.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.250
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.375
What are you gonna do?

11:38.375 --> 11:39.750
Raise a little thief?

11:40.500 --> 11:44.375
Fuck you, Krime!
At least he won't steal from the poor.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.916
-Relax.
-Where's my polo?

11:47.500 --> 11:49.041
You're wearing it.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.125
Take it.

11:51.916 --> 11:53.166
Show your booby.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.375
Do it! That would be nice.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.375
Hi there.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.458
Long time, no see. You look stunning.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.666
Guys say hi.

12:12.208 --> 12:13.916
It was fun. Pity you went home.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.000
Are you gonna introduce me?

12:17.541 --> 12:19.250
-Exactly?
-Exactly.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.166
My besties: Kobra and Kama.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.958
-Besties…
-Kobra.

12:24.041 --> 12:24.875
Tomek.

12:28.125 --> 12:28.958
Hi.

12:32.416 --> 12:33.541
Nice nails.

12:36.208 --> 12:37.791
What's wrong with you?

12:38.833 --> 12:40.000
You look bored.

12:41.791 --> 12:44.583
How about some snow?

12:45.458 --> 12:48.583
-And only now you're asking?
-Come to my place.

12:59.375 --> 13:00.625
Okay.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.791
-I've done it before.
-Don't be afraid.

13:04.875 --> 13:05.875
Under the tongue.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.625
-Very good.
-What's that acid?

13:10.375 --> 13:14.000
Four chicks on a bike.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.666
I thought you take it…

13:15.750 --> 13:16.750
Like this?

13:23.375 --> 13:26.625
You've got three babes
and I'm not going anywhere.

13:27.166 --> 13:28.416
Cause I'm driving.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.291
These papers

13:34.583 --> 13:37.750
are part of a bigger picture that depicts

13:39.041 --> 13:40.166
a woman on a bike.

13:42.916 --> 13:45.666
Some say that it's

13:45.750 --> 13:48.875
Albert Hofmann himself
testing his invention.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.625
What a story. Chicks on bikes rule.

14:00.041 --> 14:01.166
Do you see that?

14:01.250 --> 14:03.791
Don't go tripping. It'll kick in an hour.

14:08.916 --> 14:12.166
-You're up for dancing and stuff…
-I got stung by a bee!

14:13.208 --> 14:15.208
Listen, I got stung by a bee!

14:15.291 --> 14:17.333
Kobra, what bee?

14:19.083 --> 14:23.125
-I have a hole, right here.
-There's a hole, look. A tiny hole.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.000
Why are there so many?

14:46.333 --> 14:49.750
-We'll fix it.
-Fuck! I've lost my fucking hand!

14:49.833 --> 14:51.666
Come with me. I'll fix it.

15:07.166 --> 15:08.333
Kobra?

15:16.416 --> 15:20.625
-Please, help me.
-That's what I'm doing.

15:20.708 --> 15:23.458
-Kobra?
-Something bit me.

15:23.541 --> 15:25.000
I'm helping you.

15:26.875 --> 15:27.750
Kobra?

15:28.916 --> 15:32.833
Fuck! I've lost my hand.

15:33.708 --> 15:34.875
It's okay.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.458
My hand is gone.

15:37.541 --> 15:39.208
Motherfucker!

15:44.500 --> 15:47.916
Help me, please.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.875
Did you see this hole?

15:51.958 --> 15:54.208
Fucking hell. A bee stung me.

15:55.083 --> 15:58.916
-No.
-Did you see that? Can you hear me?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.333
-Fuck!
-Kamila?

16:34.750 --> 16:36.625
We saw the fucker

16:36.708 --> 16:39.208
and he's acting like there's no problem.

16:39.291 --> 16:42.500
We put him on the ground
and bit the shit out of him.

16:42.583 --> 16:43.500
Mrówa?

16:44.458 --> 16:47.083
-What the fuck? Leave him!
-Get out of here.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.333
-Scram!
-Come on.

16:49.416 --> 16:51.375
You mix glass with coke?

16:51.458 --> 16:53.000
Krime, I'd never do that.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.291
Mrówa…

16:58.750 --> 16:59.916
You're so smart, huh?

17:01.583 --> 17:02.916
Man, leave me be!

17:07.250 --> 17:09.750
Where is the stuff?

17:09.833 --> 17:13.083
In my apartment.
I'll give you everything, just let go.

17:15.541 --> 17:18.708
-You broke my watch.
-What's going on?

17:19.583 --> 17:23.333
My friend had an accident,
but I'm helping him.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.041
-An accident?
-Yeah.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.916
I won't leave it like that. Darek?

17:31.208 --> 17:32.291
People!

17:40.666 --> 17:42.541
Do you have a permit for this shit?

17:45.916 --> 17:47.125
Are you Mexican?

17:49.625 --> 17:52.083
Are you gonna play games or talk to me?

17:52.916 --> 17:53.750
<i>Señorita?</i>

17:53.833 --> 17:55.125
You're a naughty boy.

17:56.958 --> 17:58.625
<i>Four-eleven, over?</i>

17:59.208 --> 18:00.625
It's 411, over.

18:00.708 --> 18:04.916
<i>We have a mugging on Chopin Street.</i>
<i>Slim man, 30-35 years old.</i>

18:05.000 --> 18:06.708
<i>Six feet tall.</i>

18:06.791 --> 18:10.250
<i>Possibly an albino.</i>
<i>Black trousers and black hoodie.</i>

18:11.166 --> 18:12.000
Copy that.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.000
It might be your guy.

19:00.291 --> 19:01.958
Just don't make a mess, boy.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.916
It might get ugly in here.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.000
You've finally arrived!

19:13.083 --> 19:15.083
That fucker beat up our Dareczek.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.208
Blood was everywhere.

19:17.291 --> 19:18.166
This guy?

19:23.083 --> 19:24.041
Looks like him.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.916
-It's him.
-Are you sure?

19:29.541 --> 19:31.791
Do I look like an idiot from TV?

19:31.875 --> 19:34.291
-He went that way.
-Stay here.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.083
I need a run.

19:37.416 --> 19:39.916
And something else. Where does he live?

19:40.750 --> 19:43.750
Over there. Third floor. On the left.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.375
I'm asking for the last time. Open.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.041
Wait.

19:48.833 --> 19:50.166
But you promise?

19:51.958 --> 19:54.083
Open the door, Mrówa.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.250
Do you promise?

19:56.250 --> 19:57.416
I promise.

19:59.791 --> 20:00.875
Okay.

20:11.416 --> 20:14.291
How do you welcome friends?
You look like shit.

20:15.791 --> 20:17.583
A car hit me on Chopin Street.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.583
Classical music can kill you.

20:21.416 --> 20:24.208
-What did Chudy want?
-You'll find nothing.

20:30.666 --> 20:32.625
You're a party man, aren't you?

20:33.416 --> 20:36.583
-That's not mine.
-I wouldn't admit to that either.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.416
Mrówa…

20:41.625 --> 20:44.791
This can send you
to a nice prison retreat.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.083
Let's talk.

20:49.375 --> 20:50.500
Come on.

20:58.000 --> 20:58.833
Come on.

21:07.791 --> 21:09.666
Who is he and what did he want?

21:11.250 --> 21:12.500
I don't know.

21:15.416 --> 21:16.541
Sit.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.916
Who is he and what did he want?

21:32.500 --> 21:34.458
-You couldn't call?
-I prefer knocking.

21:36.958 --> 21:39.416
Someone gotta clean up this mess.

21:41.000 --> 21:41.958
For fuck's sake.

21:59.166 --> 22:01.125
Maybe I'll come back later?

22:06.875 --> 22:08.208
Wanna join, Wajcha?

22:14.958 --> 22:15.791
What's up?

22:19.458 --> 22:20.375
Listen, doll.

22:21.166 --> 22:24.500
You did well yesterday,
but I need to talk to my bro.

22:25.750 --> 22:29.375
You help us, we help you.

22:29.458 --> 22:31.541
So, will you help us?

22:33.541 --> 22:35.541
I will, but I still need to clean.

22:46.166 --> 22:47.333
Later.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.250
Careful with that.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.208
-Someone is waiting for us.
-Who?

22:59.333 --> 23:02.416
Don't you worry. We'll be rich soon.

23:04.708 --> 23:06.333
Forget this shithole.

23:06.416 --> 23:09.541
We'll be rich like fucking banksters.

23:09.625 --> 23:10.708
Heard that before.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.333
Get inside, sir.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.958
-Am I also invited?
-Yeah, but be good.

23:25.041 --> 23:26.500
Phones off.

23:28.250 --> 23:29.750
Move your ass.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.458
-If we pull it off--
-Who was that?

23:36.541 --> 23:38.166
You know who Papier is?

23:38.250 --> 23:41.916
He has a currency exchange shop downtown.
He organized that.

23:42.583 --> 23:45.625
They belong to the mob. They'll kill us.

23:45.708 --> 23:49.375
What fucking mob? Have you seen that guy?

23:49.458 --> 23:51.625
He acted like a circus monkey.

23:53.208 --> 23:54.500
I have a bad feeling.

23:54.583 --> 23:59.708
The guy who recommended you said
you can be trusted and you know your shit.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.125
This gig can change
your financial situation.

24:04.208 --> 24:05.041
Forever.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.500
You'll become respected citizens.

24:09.541 --> 24:10.375
Just like us.

24:10.875 --> 24:15.375
We've got the chance
to change our miserable fate.

24:17.625 --> 24:20.458
-Aren't you tired of this life?
-I am.

24:20.541 --> 24:22.083
You'll pay off your debts.

24:23.208 --> 24:26.458
And when my son is born,
I'll be able to look him in the eye.

24:26.541 --> 24:28.416
Just don't start crying, okay?

24:29.000 --> 24:32.291
I'll open my business and be legit.

24:32.375 --> 24:35.375
But you got to steal the first million.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.458
Good one. Balzac?

24:38.708 --> 24:39.750
What?

24:39.833 --> 24:42.291
-Trust me, bro.
-How am I--

24:42.375 --> 24:45.958
-Let's fuck this system!
-How am I… This is nonsense.

24:46.041 --> 24:47.291
Fuck poverty!

24:50.333 --> 24:51.166
Nice.

24:52.750 --> 24:58.125
A businessman playing politics
will give another one a huge bribe.

24:58.208 --> 25:02.208
There'll be around five million
in his briefcase.

25:03.541 --> 25:05.583
It'll be chained to his wrist.

25:06.750 --> 25:10.583
You'll drive away in the stolen car
that we'll provide you.

25:11.291 --> 25:13.541
We'll split the money into five parts.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.083
Any questions?

25:16.083 --> 25:16.916
Five parts?

25:18.541 --> 25:21.583
-And there will be no security?
-You've got my word.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.458
-Five million?
-Do you have guns?

25:24.541 --> 25:25.375
Sure.

25:26.333 --> 25:27.750
Brilliant.

25:27.833 --> 25:31.375
They're old, not used in a long time.

25:31.458 --> 25:32.291
Take this one.

25:34.125 --> 25:35.708
Can you handle it?

25:35.791 --> 25:38.208
-Sure thing.
-What's your decision?

25:39.458 --> 25:42.208
We're gonna fucking kill it!

25:43.333 --> 25:44.541
Heard that?

25:48.416 --> 25:49.750
On one condition.

25:50.541 --> 25:52.000
Without snow.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.708
No snow.

25:53.791 --> 25:55.458
But promise me one thing.

25:56.125 --> 25:59.000
If something happens,
you'll take care of my son.

25:59.708 --> 26:03.208
-I want the <i>Godfather</i> theme at my funeral.
-Stop this bullshit.

26:03.708 --> 26:06.833
-It's just a joke.
-I can poke you back.

26:08.250 --> 26:09.625
No snow.

26:09.708 --> 26:11.500
<i>A white teddy bear</i>

26:11.583 --> 26:13.875
<i>For the girl</i>

26:14.791 --> 26:18.166
<i>Whom I love now and always</i>

27:05.666 --> 27:08.708
TRONIX PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

27:27.125 --> 27:28.208
Let's go!

27:44.875 --> 27:47.125
But he did wear a condom, didn't he?

27:47.208 --> 27:49.750
For fuck's sake. What got into your head?

27:49.833 --> 27:53.041
Nothing happened, thanks to you.

27:53.125 --> 27:55.375
Thanks to me?

27:55.458 --> 27:56.958
Fuck you.

27:57.041 --> 27:58.416
Fuck…

27:59.000 --> 28:01.875
-What the hell happened there?
-Stop.

28:01.958 --> 28:02.875
Your jacket.

28:04.833 --> 28:05.916
Look at me.

28:09.916 --> 28:12.708
The doctor had a few yesterday.

28:13.916 --> 28:16.958
-But I can see how bad you look.
-And?

28:18.083 --> 28:19.083
And…

28:20.958 --> 28:24.458
Every Friday, we hold meetings here.

28:25.583 --> 28:27.583
They helped me back in a day.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.458
It's kind of therapy.

28:32.291 --> 28:35.083
-You got it wrong.
-Think about it.

28:35.166 --> 28:36.666
Sure.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.416
-And?
-It's broken.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.750
-What?!
-I won't be taking the finals.

28:42.833 --> 28:43.791
No way!

28:44.375 --> 28:46.375
Ouch, you idiot!

28:47.375 --> 28:49.708
-Stinks like death.
-Catch.

28:49.791 --> 28:52.125
Excuse me.

28:52.208 --> 28:55.250
Is this your phone?
You left it in the office.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.291
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

28:58.666 --> 29:00.083
Take this bag off me.

29:09.166 --> 29:12.000
Holy fuck! What a ride!

29:12.083 --> 29:14.125
They picked us up with this one.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.208
You said you liked it.

29:17.416 --> 29:19.750
Did you think they'd steal another one?

29:23.833 --> 29:27.625
Well, V8 engine, 300 horsepower.

29:27.708 --> 29:31.666
That's what I fucking need.

29:44.375 --> 29:46.125
It must be 20 years old.

29:46.625 --> 29:47.500
So fucking what?

29:48.666 --> 29:50.166
At worst, we won't get there.

29:57.333 --> 29:59.416
We agreed on something.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.916
A small line never killed anybody.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.291
Drive.

30:31.375 --> 30:32.750
Chill, bro.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.625
We want to steal something
using a stolen car.

30:37.541 --> 30:40.041
-Don't shit yourself.
-Don't touch me.

30:42.291 --> 30:45.208
You're a dickhead.
Focus on the road, Wajcha.

30:45.791 --> 30:47.125
On the toad?

30:48.541 --> 30:49.916
Yeah.

30:50.958 --> 30:52.333
Just chill, dude.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.916
What got you so paranoid? Drugs?

30:57.916 --> 31:02.208
I'm already planning
how I'm gonna spend my money.

31:02.291 --> 31:05.958
-Why are you laughing?
-What you gonna get?

31:06.041 --> 31:10.625
I'll get a sweet fucking bling chain,
thicker than this one.

31:11.125 --> 31:14.875
Made of platinum, not some fucking tombac.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.916
-A nice ride.
-What kind?

31:18.000 --> 31:22.708
Simple. A prince needs a Merc.

31:22.791 --> 31:24.958
-I'd get a jeep.
-Me, Merc.

31:25.041 --> 31:27.875
A jeep would suit you. Get a Škoda.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.083
I'll buy a house for the hussy.

31:32.583 --> 31:34.583
You'll buy a house and then what?

31:34.666 --> 31:36.958
I'll marry her and get her pregnant.

31:37.041 --> 31:41.000
No fucking way.
With the hussy? Are you insane?

31:41.083 --> 31:41.916
She's great.

31:42.708 --> 31:45.166
You're gonna end up six feet under.

31:46.375 --> 31:49.791
How can you marry the hussy?
Just think about it.

32:02.291 --> 32:04.333
-Krime!
-Wajcha!

32:10.916 --> 32:12.750
On the ground, you fuckers!

32:13.416 --> 32:15.666
-What's going on?
-You heard me!

32:15.750 --> 32:19.000
Get the fuck on the ground! Stay still!

32:24.875 --> 32:26.166
Stay down.

32:28.875 --> 32:30.000
-Don't shoot!
-Down!

32:30.083 --> 32:32.125
-Don't shoot! Take the cash!
-Stay!

32:32.208 --> 32:33.958
-Don't shoot.
-Relax.

32:34.041 --> 32:36.291
I'm calling the police!

32:37.125 --> 32:40.708
You wanna live?
Shut up and get on the ground.

32:43.958 --> 32:46.916
-No!
-Come on.

32:52.041 --> 32:53.291
Over here, you idiot.

32:59.083 --> 33:01.541
Don't do anything.

33:09.416 --> 33:10.541
We're leaving.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.083
-It's over.
-"Don't shoot"? Five million!

33:25.166 --> 33:29.708
-No, don't--
-You acted like a student!

33:36.916 --> 33:39.916
-Wrong way, turn right.
-It was one way.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.500
It was a shortcut. You know what that is?

33:42.583 --> 33:44.666
-Don't shit yourself.
-Turn right.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.666
We're fucked because you had to get high
and act like an owl.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.291
That's great. Well done.

33:57.458 --> 33:59.000
I can't believe it!

33:59.583 --> 34:03.583
You look like an ancestor
of owl and toucan.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.583
You're a fucking toucanowl.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.666
We did it, man!

34:09.750 --> 34:12.541
Bang-bang! On the ground, bitches!

34:13.833 --> 34:16.250
Did you have be rough with the waitress?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.500
Why are you laughing?

34:19.583 --> 34:23.375
We're the Knights of the Round Table
and you told her to shut up.

34:23.458 --> 34:25.583
-What was I supposed to say?
-What to say--

34:25.666 --> 34:29.916
-"Could you please shut up?"
-We're the Knights of the Round Table.

34:30.000 --> 34:30.833
Who?

34:30.916 --> 34:33.458
Knights of the Round Table.
Didn't you know?

34:33.958 --> 34:36.750
You acted like a redneck.
Knights don't say that--

34:36.833 --> 34:40.666
What do the knights say?
"My Lady, please lie on the ground"?

34:41.750 --> 34:46.208
-You should have said that.
-Tell me what was I supposed to say.

34:46.791 --> 34:49.708
"Excuse me ma'am,
please lie on the ground."

34:49.791 --> 34:51.875
Exactly.

34:51.958 --> 34:54.291
-You know how that sounds?
-How?

34:54.375 --> 34:56.791
-Very gangsta.
-My intention.

34:56.875 --> 34:59.166
Gangsta Knight of the Round Table.

34:59.916 --> 35:03.333
You acted like a peasant with a pitchfork.

35:04.125 --> 35:07.541
-I'm Lancelot, get that?
-Yeah, right.

35:07.625 --> 35:10.500
-Lancelot.
-Would Lancelot speak like that?

35:10.583 --> 35:14.750
-He always spoke like that.
-Like what? "Shut it"?

35:14.833 --> 35:17.416
-I said "shut up."
-He'd add, "princess."

35:19.000 --> 35:20.708
The lady-killer lives here.

35:22.708 --> 35:23.791
So?

35:25.416 --> 35:28.208
-It doesn't interest you?
-It's not our case.

35:29.250 --> 35:30.583
Unfortunately.

35:30.666 --> 35:33.500
-You'd rather chase losers?
-Someone has to.

35:36.833 --> 35:40.166
-I know him. It's Chada!
-Cops!

35:40.250 --> 35:41.625
Go!

35:43.708 --> 35:45.083
Faster!

35:45.166 --> 35:47.166
Holy shit! Go.

35:54.583 --> 35:56.125
Relax.

35:57.500 --> 35:58.958
A green jaguar--

35:59.041 --> 36:01.166
Can't you see it's brown?

36:01.250 --> 36:02.083
Not gray?

36:02.958 --> 36:04.291
Khaki, I don't know.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.750
An olive Jaguar.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.833
We've got him, kiddo.

36:10.291 --> 36:11.791
Another cop car.

36:14.125 --> 36:16.916
Plan B, Wajcha. Speed up!

36:22.625 --> 36:24.208
Get him!

36:32.625 --> 36:35.958
Block the exit to Gdańsk on the bypass.

36:38.833 --> 36:40.083
Faster!

36:44.708 --> 36:47.625
-Fucking car.
-Relax, mom.

36:55.750 --> 36:56.791
Speed up.

36:59.541 --> 37:00.833
Turn right.

37:06.750 --> 37:07.708
We'll lose them.

37:12.250 --> 37:13.583
Two on the right.

37:14.125 --> 37:15.541
Take the gravel road.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.041
To the forest.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.291
Did we lose them?

37:27.375 --> 37:28.458
Follow them!

37:36.750 --> 37:38.250
We're gonna get them.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.125
Happy now?

37:49.666 --> 37:50.583
A boar!

37:53.166 --> 37:54.333
Slow down.

38:17.416 --> 38:21.416
-Everything is fine.
-Stop talking.

38:23.208 --> 38:25.625
-Just go.
-Can you feel your legs?

38:25.708 --> 38:26.916
-No.
-What?

38:27.416 --> 38:28.291
Just kidding.

38:34.833 --> 38:35.666
Come on.

38:40.166 --> 38:41.708
Come on.

38:46.666 --> 38:49.000
Wake up. Can you hear me?

38:54.458 --> 38:55.375
Let's go.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.458
We are. We'll close the door and go.

39:08.666 --> 39:11.791
Hands on your heads!
Step out of the car, shitheads!

39:30.250 --> 39:31.625
Out, young lady.

39:40.083 --> 39:42.458
You're the true Lancelot now.

39:49.625 --> 39:50.666
Hold this.

39:54.541 --> 39:56.125
Thieves!

40:18.125 --> 40:19.458
What happened?

40:20.166 --> 40:21.583
I slipped.

40:21.666 --> 40:23.541
Your stepdad will be pissed.

40:23.625 --> 40:26.166
-You'll ruin our lives.
-You're crazy?

40:26.250 --> 40:31.666
Dad has problems, he needs our support
or everything will be fucked!

40:33.333 --> 40:35.750
-Hi.
-Inspector Jaskółka and Federowicz.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.208
We've some questions.

40:37.291 --> 40:39.291
-Sure.
-I'm sorry.

40:39.375 --> 40:40.416
Shoot.

40:40.916 --> 40:41.916
Okay.

40:46.041 --> 40:47.041
Have you noticed…

40:48.166 --> 40:49.416
Sir, have you noticed

40:50.375 --> 40:55.166
anything specific that could lead us
to the offenders?

40:55.250 --> 40:57.916
No, it happened so fast.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.500
Do you recognize this man?

41:01.208 --> 41:03.958
They had balaclavas on.

41:04.958 --> 41:09.583
In this country, when you
earn your success with hard work,

41:09.666 --> 41:12.083
others will bring you back down.

41:15.583 --> 41:16.416
Right.

41:17.833 --> 41:21.500
-They took your briefcase.
-Correct.

41:21.583 --> 41:23.250
From what I know,

41:23.333 --> 41:28.166
it says so in my notes,
you didn't report that.

41:29.083 --> 41:31.166
So, here's my question.

41:32.125 --> 41:33.500
What was inside?

41:34.041 --> 41:39.083
Company's documents, wallet, credit cards…
Who the hell is this guy, Aneta?

41:45.000 --> 41:46.250
Here's the thing.

41:47.583 --> 41:52.458
Why anyone would go to such an extent

41:52.541 --> 41:57.458
to steal a briefcase
that is chained to the wrist?

41:58.041 --> 42:00.833
Call your boss.

42:00.916 --> 42:02.458
You're boring me.

42:03.916 --> 42:07.500
Seriously?
It doesn't work like that anymore.

42:07.583 --> 42:10.666
They knew perfectly well
what was in the briefcase.

42:10.750 --> 42:14.333
Let me ask again: what was inside?

42:14.416 --> 42:15.500
Go fuck yourself.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.333
You're boring me.

42:19.375 --> 42:22.375
-Take him away, Aneta.
-I'm sorry.

42:22.458 --> 42:26.416
He's young and ambitious.
Wants to solve that case badly.

42:27.166 --> 42:28.333
How much do you make?

42:31.333 --> 42:32.958
It isn't worth it.

42:33.041 --> 42:35.541
It isn't worth it regardless.

42:36.166 --> 42:38.000
Just one more question.

42:39.208 --> 42:41.375
Where will I find your bodyguards?

42:42.041 --> 42:43.875
Doctor!

42:43.958 --> 42:45.250
I feel weak.

42:46.875 --> 42:48.333
I'm sorry, Kazimierz.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.250
I'll make it up to you.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.416
Is everything okay?

42:54.708 --> 42:56.583
What the fuck are you doing?

42:59.833 --> 43:01.208
That was questioning?

43:01.875 --> 43:04.958
Showing your emotions is not professional.

43:05.041 --> 43:07.458
-Who hired you?
-You know him?

43:09.250 --> 43:10.416
You don't?

43:11.791 --> 43:14.791
He has the biggest
ophthalmic clinic in Poland.

43:14.875 --> 43:18.708
You don't know him?
He deals with the National Health Fund.

43:19.500 --> 43:23.208
The Internal Security Agency is involved
and we don't need any--

43:23.291 --> 43:25.333
You don't find it weird at all?

43:26.625 --> 43:29.625
How did a petty thief get involved?

43:29.708 --> 43:33.208
They found a scapegoat.
We need to talk to Chudy.

43:33.291 --> 43:35.083
You've lost your mind.

43:35.833 --> 43:37.333
Forget about it.

44:36.416 --> 44:38.500
Hang in there.

44:38.583 --> 44:40.875
Help me, Wajcha.

44:43.708 --> 44:45.625
Three, two , one.

45:01.750 --> 45:03.291
Where are the keys?

45:04.250 --> 45:06.000
Can you hear me? The keys!

45:14.750 --> 45:16.708
I hope grandma doesn't come back.

45:22.916 --> 45:24.250
Don't fall asleep.

45:30.958 --> 45:31.833
Wajcha.

45:34.750 --> 45:36.708
Come over here.

45:37.291 --> 45:39.708
Take this.

45:40.875 --> 45:43.166
On the upper gum.

45:56.625 --> 45:58.416
-Phone.
-What?

46:00.583 --> 46:02.583
Marta's number is in the kitchen.

46:03.333 --> 46:05.875
-Somewhere between the bottles.
-It's a bad idea.

46:05.958 --> 46:07.458
Get it. For fuck's sake.

46:20.750 --> 46:22.250
This one?

46:31.750 --> 46:32.708
Give it to me.

46:38.541 --> 46:39.375
Hey.

46:49.041 --> 46:49.875
Come--

46:51.625 --> 46:52.791
Come here.

46:53.875 --> 46:55.500
To grandma's.

46:59.083 --> 47:00.291
I can't.

47:09.708 --> 47:10.958
Look at the dough.

47:17.041 --> 47:18.833
Wajcha.

47:21.458 --> 47:23.125
Wajcha? Hey.

47:23.875 --> 47:24.708
Wajcha.

47:26.291 --> 47:27.416
Fuck!

47:29.666 --> 47:32.708
I need a rest.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.208
I haven't seen him.

47:52.666 --> 47:56.000
MAY 1, 2014

48:19.958 --> 48:22.250
-You're here?
-Why so late?

48:30.333 --> 48:31.291
Jesus.

48:46.166 --> 48:47.208
Listen.

48:48.500 --> 48:52.583
-Oh my God.
-He'll be fine. A bee stung him.

48:54.833 --> 48:57.875
It must have been quite a bee.

48:59.833 --> 49:00.958
Okay.

49:18.791 --> 49:22.250
The bullet went through.
He's lost a lot of blood.

49:23.041 --> 49:24.208
Leave.

50:59.125 --> 51:01.250
I thought you were not gonna wake up.

51:02.041 --> 51:03.208
Stop it.

51:04.416 --> 51:06.166
I wouldn't dare to.

51:14.208 --> 51:15.541
I'm sorry.

51:19.958 --> 51:22.125
Let me listen to the young lion.

51:32.916 --> 51:34.541
Thanks.

51:36.125 --> 51:37.708
Shall we name him Oskar?

51:41.250 --> 51:43.666
Fuck! I'm dying, Marta.

51:45.791 --> 51:47.250
No, you're not.

51:49.250 --> 51:51.708
-How are you?
-Better.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.291
Don't tell her.

51:57.125 --> 52:01.375
Maybe I should know
what you two got yourselves into.

52:04.416 --> 52:05.583
Oskar.

52:07.750 --> 52:08.708
What's up?

52:13.958 --> 52:16.000
Thanks for not leaving me.

52:18.625 --> 52:19.875
All by myself.

52:20.458 --> 52:21.625
In the forest.

52:23.666 --> 52:25.041
Don't call me Oskar.

52:25.833 --> 52:28.041
You never leave your bro behind.

52:28.583 --> 52:31.875
You came back for me once.
Remember that, Marta?

52:33.250 --> 52:34.208
Thanks.

52:35.166 --> 52:37.375
Of course she does.

52:37.458 --> 52:38.833
We're even.

52:44.250 --> 52:45.083
My love.

52:51.666 --> 52:53.916
You want something from the shop?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.166
No, thanks.

52:57.458 --> 52:59.000
I'll make you dinner.

53:13.041 --> 53:16.166
-Oh, boy…
-Leave him alone.

53:19.666 --> 53:21.666
I'm the one who put us in trouble.

53:25.166 --> 53:27.583
<i>Police are looking for two men</i>

53:27.666 --> 53:31.916
<i>suspected of armed robbery</i>
<i>in the restaurant near town.</i>

53:32.625 --> 53:33.625
<i>One of them…</i>

53:33.708 --> 53:34.541
May I?

53:34.625 --> 53:35.750
<i>…is a skinny male,</i>

53:35.833 --> 53:36.666
Yeah.

53:36.750 --> 53:42.250
<i>approximately 35-years-old, six feet tall,</i>
<i>elongated face, blond hair.</i>

53:42.333 --> 53:44.041
<i>While searching the woods…</i>

53:44.125 --> 53:45.500
And whiskey.

53:45.583 --> 53:48.541
<i>…another woman's body was found.</i>

53:48.625 --> 53:51.833
<i>It's another woman found dead</i>
<i>in recent weeks.</i>

53:51.916 --> 53:54.541
<i>Are we dealing with a serial killer here?</i>

53:55.333 --> 53:56.583
And a bag.

54:11.750 --> 54:12.666
Anything else?

54:13.916 --> 54:15.208
Smokes.

54:25.208 --> 54:26.375
Poor girls.

54:28.333 --> 54:30.125
It's 148.

54:37.166 --> 54:38.000
Wait.

54:42.666 --> 54:43.750
Smokes.

54:45.833 --> 54:46.916
Thanks.

54:51.083 --> 54:52.583
I've brought medicine.

55:19.541 --> 55:20.750
Where's my cash?

55:30.500 --> 55:33.208
It's up to you if you gonna live or die.

55:34.125 --> 55:36.666
Look. Your friend didn't wanna talk.

55:37.791 --> 55:39.166
You're a dead man.

55:55.500 --> 55:56.708
I like you.

55:57.458 --> 55:59.166
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

55:59.708 --> 56:02.416
-You're feisty.
-Shoot, you sucker.

56:17.666 --> 56:18.750
What the fuck?

56:20.000 --> 56:21.083
Boss?

56:22.083 --> 56:24.958
What? A fucking albino?

56:25.708 --> 56:28.000
Fucking hell. Boss?

56:30.208 --> 56:32.333
-What now?
-What?

56:32.958 --> 56:34.541
-You're gonna shoot?
-Yes.

56:41.250 --> 56:43.166
Lie still.

56:53.291 --> 56:54.125
Marta.

56:56.666 --> 56:57.666
Marta.

56:58.708 --> 56:59.708
Marta!

58:52.833 --> 58:55.875
<i>We'll be rich like fucking banksters.</i>

58:55.958 --> 58:58.250
<i>Aren't you tired of this life?</i>

58:58.833 --> 59:00.791
<i>You'll pay off your debts.</i>

59:00.875 --> 59:04.458
<i>I'll open my business and be legit.</i>

59:04.541 --> 59:08.083
<i>And when my son is born,</i>
<i>I'll be able to look him in the eye.</i>

59:08.166 --> 59:10.041
<i>Just don't start crying.</i>

59:10.125 --> 59:11.625
<i>But promise me one thing.</i>

59:11.708 --> 59:14.708
<i>If something happens,</i>
<i>you'll take care of my son.</i>

59:14.791 --> 59:16.958
<i>-Who was that?</i>
<i>-You know who Papier is?</i>

59:17.041 --> 59:20.541
<i>He has a currency exchange shop downtown.</i>
<i>He organized that.</i>

1:00:19.125 --> 1:00:22.291
Kruszol, come down to the pawnshop
and bring the guys.

1:00:22.375 --> 1:00:23.541
Krime's here.

1:00:24.541 --> 1:00:25.916
We'll fuck him up.

1:00:27.708 --> 1:00:28.958
Good afternoon.

1:00:29.708 --> 1:00:31.083
And goodbye.

1:00:32.916 --> 1:00:34.125
Open the door.

1:00:42.041 --> 1:00:43.416
Open it.

1:00:55.416 --> 1:00:57.208
You're already a dead man.

1:01:05.708 --> 1:01:06.875
Who are those people?

1:01:07.791 --> 1:01:10.750
-Who are they?
-Military Information Services.

1:01:11.708 --> 1:01:16.000
They'll kill you and all your family.

1:01:21.708 --> 1:01:24.791
Run, maybe you can still make it.

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:30.750
Why us?

1:01:37.458 --> 1:01:38.625
Why?

1:01:39.541 --> 1:01:43.000
They needed losers.
You were the perfect choice.

1:01:49.166 --> 1:01:50.166
I see.

1:01:53.208 --> 1:01:54.208
I see.

1:01:57.041 --> 1:02:00.333
We got a call that you harass women

1:02:01.541 --> 1:02:03.041
in this area.

1:02:03.125 --> 1:02:05.333
-Women?
-By wearing that coat.

1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:07.875
-What?
-Well…

1:02:07.958 --> 1:02:10.291
It's unbuttoned, you can see nothing.

1:02:10.833 --> 1:02:13.041
Maybe, but they're scared.

1:02:13.583 --> 1:02:15.375
-They have a reason.
-I don't know…

1:02:15.458 --> 1:02:17.750
You're drooling all over them.

1:02:20.375 --> 1:02:22.625
-Yes.
-Yes?

1:02:24.833 --> 1:02:27.291
Hi, Krime. And now what?

1:02:33.500 --> 1:02:35.083
I'll be gentle.

1:02:35.791 --> 1:02:37.958
We're not gonna make a scene.

1:02:38.791 --> 1:02:40.458
What now, bitch?

1:02:41.125 --> 1:02:42.708
Easy, Mrówa.

1:02:44.083 --> 1:02:46.875
-Go get some ice cream.
-Don't make me stab you.

1:02:46.958 --> 1:02:49.916
For fuck's sake.
Okay, but don't start without me.

1:02:54.250 --> 1:02:55.416
Go with him.

1:02:57.500 --> 1:02:59.666
Keys and stuff.

1:03:00.458 --> 1:03:01.541
Now.

1:03:02.208 --> 1:03:03.333
Good.

1:03:07.041 --> 1:03:09.708
-Let's go.
-You'll have an adventure.

1:03:10.500 --> 1:03:11.750
In the forest.

1:03:12.333 --> 1:03:14.375
Don't get the interior all dirty.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.583
You don't want more expenses.

1:03:19.333 --> 1:03:22.250
Get the fuck in.

1:03:37.708 --> 1:03:40.041
Hey! Dudes!

1:03:40.125 --> 1:03:41.500
What the fuck?

1:03:42.791 --> 1:03:43.791
Fuck!

1:04:25.208 --> 1:04:28.625
<i>Fear is near, in the woods</i>
<i>Arrived the boys in tracksuits</i>

1:04:28.708 --> 1:04:30.625
-I loved Backstreet Boys.
-Hello.

1:04:31.208 --> 1:04:33.583
-What's up?
-Sorry to scare the fish away.

1:04:35.375 --> 1:04:37.291
Piss off, old man.

1:04:37.791 --> 1:04:39.250
We're busy here.

1:04:40.458 --> 1:04:42.416
You have something mine.

1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:44.416
-The car belongs to me now.
-Really?

1:04:44.500 --> 1:04:46.625
-Really.
-Really?

1:04:47.166 --> 1:04:49.666
Are you deaf? Get the fuck out!

1:04:51.625 --> 1:04:52.750
Quickly.

1:04:53.291 --> 1:04:54.583
Hop in the car.

1:04:55.125 --> 1:04:58.875
I just want to chat
with that ginger faggot.

1:04:59.541 --> 1:05:00.541
But I get it.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:06.541
-What is he doing?
-Hey!

1:05:06.625 --> 1:05:10.791
-Fucking chill! We can talk this over.
-No, we fucking can't.

1:07:43.416 --> 1:07:45.000
We got pretty lucky.

1:07:46.291 --> 1:07:48.291
We're stuck with each other.

1:07:50.250 --> 1:07:51.083
So?

1:07:52.291 --> 1:07:53.375
Lucky?

1:07:57.208 --> 1:07:58.041
Lucky.

1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:34.583
What?

1:08:34.666 --> 1:08:37.000
<i>Hey! Ready to party?</i>

1:08:37.875 --> 1:08:39.583
What party?

1:08:39.666 --> 1:08:40.500
<i>You dimwit!</i>

1:08:40.583 --> 1:08:42.625
I told you. Hip-hop party.

1:08:42.708 --> 1:08:44.458
Today in the Ferr Club.

1:08:45.208 --> 1:08:47.375
<i>Filthy hats will show up?</i>

1:08:48.083 --> 1:08:51.666
No, but naughty boys will come.

1:08:54.416 --> 1:08:56.083
I'm not into that.

1:08:56.625 --> 1:08:58.458
<i>Come on, I'm in the car outside.</i>

1:08:58.541 --> 1:09:00.208
I'm grounded.

1:09:00.291 --> 1:09:03.083
My dad's at the hospital
and mom locked me in.

1:09:03.166 --> 1:09:05.250
Think of something, bitch.

1:09:05.875 --> 1:09:07.250
Give me a sec.

1:09:08.041 --> 1:09:10.291
<i>-Bye.</i>
-See you, slut.

1:09:27.541 --> 1:09:29.583
I'll get you, albino.

1:09:33.500 --> 1:09:35.500
Got a little mess on the beach.

1:09:36.958 --> 1:09:38.541
I'll send you the coordinates.

1:09:39.083 --> 1:09:41.666
Yes, clean up. Four bin bags, one ours.

1:09:42.208 --> 1:09:43.125
The driver.

1:09:43.625 --> 1:09:44.916
Life is harsh.

1:09:45.458 --> 1:09:47.208
Get rid of the bodies.

1:09:48.750 --> 1:09:50.083
Over.

1:09:50.166 --> 1:09:51.208
Yes.

1:10:20.041 --> 1:10:21.166
What happened?

1:10:22.416 --> 1:10:24.500
-Wajcha is dead.
-What?

1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:26.750
Get inside.

1:10:34.708 --> 1:10:35.791
Wajcha is dead?

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:41.875
Here you go.

1:10:44.875 --> 1:10:46.250
Best if I'm not seen.

1:10:47.833 --> 1:10:49.875
Didn't get money again.

1:10:49.958 --> 1:10:54.041
-Oh, well.
-You never pay for yourself anyway.

1:10:55.291 --> 1:10:58.416
We'll figure something out. As always.

1:10:58.500 --> 1:10:59.458
Come on.

1:11:04.208 --> 1:11:06.208
-Hey.
-Hi, girls.

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.000
Boss is upstairs. You need to pay today.

1:11:11.875 --> 1:11:13.916
-What?
-You need to pay.

1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.375
Won't you let us in?

1:11:17.083 --> 1:11:18.250
Wait.

1:11:18.958 --> 1:11:22.125
I'll give you a towel and some clothes.

1:11:22.208 --> 1:11:25.166
I pay for your fucking time.
Get back to the mixer.

1:11:25.250 --> 1:11:26.708
Be right back.

1:11:26.791 --> 1:11:28.625
-Get back now.
-Wait.

1:11:28.708 --> 1:11:31.208
-Why you need a gun?
-I'll get rid of him.

1:11:31.875 --> 1:11:33.666
Nuta, come back here.

1:11:33.750 --> 1:11:36.333
-Wait a second.
-I don't have the time.

1:11:36.416 --> 1:11:37.958
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

1:11:39.333 --> 1:11:41.000
You're not getting paid.

1:11:41.083 --> 1:11:43.208
I'll be back in a second.

1:11:47.291 --> 1:11:48.166
Play it.

1:12:38.583 --> 1:12:39.791
Hi, girls.

1:12:41.125 --> 1:12:43.583
Do you have a company for tonight?

1:12:45.041 --> 1:12:48.666
-Maybe we do.
-Maybe we don't.

1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.166
Come with me.

1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:06.875
Can I hit on you?

1:13:15.416 --> 1:13:16.916
You want some drinks?

1:13:18.458 --> 1:13:19.541
Are you buying?

1:13:20.458 --> 1:13:22.666
-It's on me.
-So, let's go.

1:13:51.250 --> 1:13:55.208
<i>Drinks, codeine, Rolex with diamonds</i>
<i>The bitch is holding it in her hand</i>

1:13:56.041 --> 1:13:59.041
<i>Don't walk up to me bitch</i>
<i>I won't be fucking nice</i>

1:13:59.125 --> 1:14:01.125
<i>I'm counting a lot of cash</i>
<i>A lot of cash</i>

1:14:01.833 --> 1:14:04.166
<i>Cold ice on my wrist</i>
<i>Fuck yeah</i>

1:14:05.250 --> 1:14:06.208
<i>Fucking awesome</i>

1:14:12.041 --> 1:14:14.041
-Nice?
-Awesome.

1:14:15.333 --> 1:14:16.541
Masterpiece.

1:14:17.125 --> 1:14:20.541
-What?
-How much are you charging those morons?

1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:26.708
Are you fucking lost?
It's a musical studio, cunt.

1:14:26.791 --> 1:14:29.333
-I'm sorry.
-You better be.

1:14:29.416 --> 1:14:31.958
-You know who the fuck I am?
-No.

1:14:32.041 --> 1:14:33.833
So shut the fuck up.

1:14:33.916 --> 1:14:37.416
-What the hell?
-Cut it out, boys.

1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:39.958
-Have you lost your mind?
-Kica, calm down.

1:14:40.583 --> 1:14:43.208
-Fucking hell.
-Easy! You'll fuck my studio.

1:14:43.291 --> 1:14:46.500
-Fine. Tie your laces.
-Chill!

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:47.583
-Laces.
-Stop it!

1:14:47.666 --> 1:14:49.666
Rev!

1:14:53.416 --> 1:14:55.708
Welcome, everyone!

1:14:57.958 --> 1:15:00.250
Are you having fun?

1:15:02.333 --> 1:15:05.666
Put your hands in the air!

1:15:52.958 --> 1:15:55.500
I'm taking a week off.

1:15:55.583 --> 1:15:58.750
POLICE

1:15:58.833 --> 1:16:00.416
To be with my family.

1:16:03.541 --> 1:16:05.250
-I heard that.
-Thank you.

1:16:14.916 --> 1:16:20.791
I've got tipped off by our informer
about the whereabouts of our suspect.

1:16:23.166 --> 1:16:26.333
-Which one?
-Well, I guess it's…

1:16:26.416 --> 1:16:28.875
Chudy, the one you're after.

1:16:30.708 --> 1:16:35.125
The CI saw him fifteen minutes ago
in a studio on Żelazna Street.

1:16:40.791 --> 1:16:41.833
Thanks.

1:16:48.625 --> 1:16:50.000
Has she been good?

1:16:54.750 --> 1:16:56.791
So she will be fucked.

1:16:57.708 --> 1:17:00.250
-What?
-Dick needs to get wet.

1:17:00.333 --> 1:17:01.666
Let go of me!

1:17:04.208 --> 1:17:05.250
Leave me!

1:17:07.791 --> 1:17:08.833
Get off!

1:17:10.791 --> 1:17:13.041
Let go of me!

1:17:15.041 --> 1:17:16.500
Let go!

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.458
-I need to talk to him.
-Cops!

1:17:32.125 --> 1:17:33.750
Chudy, trust me and don't run.

1:17:38.458 --> 1:17:41.291
-Open up!
-Take this with you.

1:17:41.375 --> 1:17:43.083
I'll look after Lucky.

1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:48.333
Now!

1:18:40.458 --> 1:18:41.375
Come inside.

1:18:44.250 --> 1:18:45.083
Chudy?

1:18:53.291 --> 1:18:54.416
I just wanna talk.

1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:56.208
I can help you! Watch out!

1:19:03.166 --> 1:19:06.083
What the fuck is going on, Lucky?

1:19:34.750 --> 1:19:36.208
Fuck off!

1:19:46.083 --> 1:19:47.041
Now.

1:19:48.916 --> 1:19:49.833
Now.

1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.333
Can you hear me?

1:20:04.500 --> 1:20:06.416
I'm here. Do you hear me?

1:20:17.500 --> 1:20:20.000
Open your eyes, please.

1:20:39.708 --> 1:20:40.833
Breathe.

1:20:47.333 --> 1:20:50.791
Don't go towards the light.
Focus on living.

1:20:51.458 --> 1:20:53.416
Can you hear me? What's your name?

1:20:54.625 --> 1:20:55.833
Hey.

1:21:04.041 --> 1:21:06.000
Hang in there.

1:21:07.458 --> 1:21:09.416
Yes, yes!

1:21:10.875 --> 1:21:12.458
Do you hear me? I'm here.

1:21:12.541 --> 1:21:14.625
Look at me.

1:21:15.416 --> 1:21:17.000
I'm here.

1:21:30.666 --> 1:21:32.000
Look at me.

1:21:33.333 --> 1:21:35.333
It's okay. 911?

1:21:35.416 --> 1:21:39.583
A young woman,
at the back of the Ferr Club, hurry!

1:21:44.208 --> 1:21:46.875
Open your eyes.

1:21:46.958 --> 1:21:49.083
I'm here. Look at me.

1:21:57.416 --> 1:21:58.791
I'll put you down, okay?

1:22:07.791 --> 1:22:09.000
See?

1:22:10.875 --> 1:22:11.958
Hi.

1:22:12.958 --> 1:22:15.375
-What's up?
-He got shot.

1:22:15.958 --> 1:22:17.708
Can you hear me?

1:22:17.791 --> 1:22:19.166
-Gunshot.
-One sec.

1:22:24.291 --> 1:22:26.208
-Will it take long?
-All yours.

1:22:26.291 --> 1:22:27.666
Sir?

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.375
Move.

1:22:52.291 --> 1:22:54.291
He's dead.

1:22:54.375 --> 1:22:56.875
Bring the black bag, I'll call the police.

1:23:35.333 --> 1:23:38.125
Let us through. We've got a dying girl.

1:23:38.208 --> 1:23:40.583
-Who's in there?
-Nobody.

1:23:41.291 --> 1:23:43.458
-Nobody.
-Why is she answering?

1:23:44.958 --> 1:23:46.875
She's gonna die.

1:23:46.958 --> 1:23:49.208
-Let us through.
-Go.

1:23:49.291 --> 1:23:50.916
-A new girl?
-Yeah.

1:23:51.916 --> 1:23:54.875
-Go.
-See you on Saturday. Get drinks.

1:23:58.208 --> 1:24:00.041
You'll never leave her again.

1:24:02.083 --> 1:24:03.750
You love her.

1:24:03.833 --> 1:24:06.375
Hey, look at that.

1:24:06.958 --> 1:24:09.291
Love at first sight.

1:24:11.208 --> 1:24:13.083
She holds you so tightly.

1:24:13.916 --> 1:24:15.250
Give me her ID.

1:24:16.916 --> 1:24:18.250
Pass it to him.

1:24:20.375 --> 1:24:21.416
Give it to him.

1:24:29.541 --> 1:24:33.333
We've got a heavily beaten girl.
Kamila Wójcik, age…

1:24:34.791 --> 1:24:35.875
Nineteen.

1:24:36.583 --> 1:24:38.708
You're my angel.

1:25:00.375 --> 1:25:02.583
Promise you're not gonna leave me.

1:25:07.583 --> 1:25:08.583
Yes.

1:25:10.916 --> 1:25:11.916
Yes.

1:26:04.416 --> 1:26:06.666
The gun didn't fire for a reason.

1:26:09.125 --> 1:26:11.083
God has another plan for you.

1:26:21.166 --> 1:26:22.333
For the old favor.

1:26:37.250 --> 1:26:38.291
I don't smoke.

1:27:05.041 --> 1:27:06.083
<i>For the old favor.</i>

1:27:42.375 --> 1:27:43.708
MESSAGES

1:27:43.791 --> 1:27:47.750
WE'D DROP BY, BUT HOSPITALS STINK.
LET US KNOW WHEN YOU'RE OUT.

1:27:47.833 --> 1:27:49.333
What does it say?

1:27:54.875 --> 1:27:56.041
See?

1:27:57.375 --> 1:27:59.416
Friends are worried about you.

1:28:01.166 --> 1:28:04.250
Smile, sunshine.

1:28:12.166 --> 1:28:13.250
Kamila.

1:28:18.791 --> 1:28:21.041
I'm sorry for everything, Mom.

1:28:38.208 --> 1:28:39.833
Don't ever be sorry.

1:28:41.375 --> 1:28:47.458
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

1:28:48.750 --> 1:28:49.958
What's wrong?

1:28:50.875 --> 1:28:51.958
Did someone die?

1:28:52.041 --> 1:28:54.000
What's that supposed to be?

1:28:59.125 --> 1:29:02.708
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

1:29:02.791 --> 1:29:09.791
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1:29:10.458 --> 1:29:15.250
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1:29:15.333 --> 1:29:17.541
-To who?
-Kamila!

1:30:41.291 --> 1:30:42.708
HELLO!

1:30:42.791 --> 1:30:44.416
HI!

1:30:44.500 --> 1:30:47.416
I HAVE YOUR NECKLACE.

1:31:06.208 --> 1:31:08.375
WHY SO SILENT?

1:31:36.500 --> 1:31:37.458
Look up.

1:31:56.916 --> 1:31:58.125
Shall we go there?

1:32:01.125 --> 1:32:02.166
Come on.

1:32:47.416 --> 1:32:48.291
Hi.

1:32:58.041 --> 1:33:00.416
-I had to see you.
-You're not going!

1:33:00.500 --> 1:33:01.666
Kamila?

1:33:02.666 --> 1:33:05.166
-Forget about it.
-You've got a guard?

1:33:06.291 --> 1:33:07.125
Even two.

1:33:08.125 --> 1:33:09.125
It's you.

1:33:12.666 --> 1:33:15.333
I was joking. Are you going out?

1:33:16.583 --> 1:33:18.541
Yes. This is Oskar.

1:33:19.125 --> 1:33:20.750
Don't stand like that.

1:33:23.500 --> 1:33:25.250
My dog's in the car.

1:33:28.458 --> 1:33:30.625
So we're off. Bye, daddy.

1:33:30.708 --> 1:33:33.666
-Do you have a cucumber salad?
-Yes.

1:33:33.750 --> 1:33:36.333
-I'll take it.
-And for the daughter?

1:33:39.375 --> 1:33:41.166
The same thing as for my dad.

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.208
With cucumber salad.
And double whiskey for dessert.

1:33:47.791 --> 1:33:49.541
-With ice.
-For the dad?

1:33:52.500 --> 1:33:55.291
Make it two. Thank you.

1:33:56.583 --> 1:33:57.708
Of course.

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:05.041
I would like to propose a toast.

1:34:06.625 --> 1:34:09.041
To what? To pork chop?

1:34:13.250 --> 1:34:14.500
To honesty.

1:35:20.208 --> 1:35:21.125
Kamila.

1:35:25.375 --> 1:35:26.208
Kamila.

1:35:37.291 --> 1:35:38.333
I'm sorry.

1:35:40.250 --> 1:35:41.708
It's not what you think.

1:35:49.958 --> 1:35:53.250
You deserve someone better than me.
You hear me?

1:35:59.458 --> 1:36:01.500
You promised you'd never leave me.

1:36:02.750 --> 1:36:04.291
I don't want to leave you.

1:36:11.166 --> 1:36:12.875
You'll never be safe with me.

1:36:44.958 --> 1:36:46.916
So… bye?

1:36:53.791 --> 1:36:54.958
In that case…

1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:56.958
bye.

1:36:57.750 --> 1:36:59.000
Any plans for tomorrow?

1:37:01.583 --> 1:37:02.958
It depends.

1:37:05.375 --> 1:37:07.500
I'll show you the land of happiness.

1:37:09.666 --> 1:37:12.791
Sounds interesting. Go on.

1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:16.666
Go on? Pack your things for two days
and you'll see.

1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:19.833
I don't know if they'll let me.

1:37:22.250 --> 1:37:23.458
I forgot.

1:37:25.708 --> 1:37:26.750
Kiddo.

1:37:27.541 --> 1:37:29.375
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

1:37:29.958 --> 1:37:30.875
Kiddo.

1:37:31.541 --> 1:37:33.500
Six o'clock. Can you make it?

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.250
Two coffees to go.

1:39:03.375 --> 1:39:07.875
And if my parents ask me what you do…

1:39:09.500 --> 1:39:10.916
what should I tell them?

1:39:17.125 --> 1:39:19.250
Never mind. Whatever.

1:39:20.750 --> 1:39:22.583
It was a stupid question.

1:39:33.958 --> 1:39:37.750
-I did many bad things.
-You don't have to tell me.

1:39:42.041 --> 1:39:43.250
I know.

1:39:45.416 --> 1:39:47.666
But my best friend died because of me.

1:39:59.125 --> 1:40:00.041
And…

1:40:01.291 --> 1:40:03.041
I don't wanna talk about it.

1:40:03.125 --> 1:40:06.041
Since you crossed my path
everything is different.

1:40:09.791 --> 1:40:11.791
For once in my life I want to…

1:40:13.458 --> 1:40:14.458
do something…

1:40:14.541 --> 1:40:15.833
Something good?

1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:19.958
Exactly. Something good.

1:40:21.666 --> 1:40:23.333
Something really good.

1:40:25.625 --> 1:40:26.875
You already did.

1:41:40.541 --> 1:41:41.375
My home.

1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:31.750
You've done a lot of bad things,

1:43:32.333 --> 1:43:36.125
but my life wasn't perfect either.

1:43:38.541 --> 1:43:41.625
Let's run away where no one can find us.

1:43:44.958 --> 1:43:45.875
Okay.

1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:48.416
Let's do that tomorrow.

1:43:49.291 --> 1:43:51.000
I wanna stay here a bit longer.

1:43:55.916 --> 1:43:57.666
We'll have an amazing evening.

1:44:11.958 --> 1:44:13.333
I'll get food for the road.

1:44:25.166 --> 1:44:27.416
Leave it, Lucky.

1:44:30.416 --> 1:44:31.375
Wait!

1:44:34.291 --> 1:44:36.125
Let's take a photo.

1:44:36.208 --> 1:44:38.041
I stepped on something.

1:44:52.750 --> 1:44:54.375
Don't publish it anywhere.

1:44:54.458 --> 1:44:56.166
-I won't.
-All right?

1:45:00.125 --> 1:45:02.333
Why do you have red nails at work?

1:45:03.250 --> 1:45:05.833
-I'm only answering the phone.
-Answer me.

1:45:07.416 --> 1:45:09.041
-I…
-We've discussed it.

1:45:09.666 --> 1:45:11.625
Is this a brothel or the police?

1:45:18.250 --> 1:45:20.125
Chudy is with the Wójcik girl.

1:45:20.625 --> 1:45:23.083
The daughter of your briefcase guy.

1:45:23.166 --> 1:45:26.291
-Where is that?
-Somewhere by the sea.

1:45:26.833 --> 1:45:28.708
Really? Not in the mountains?

1:45:29.291 --> 1:45:31.125
-Check it, Baśka.
-Okay.

1:45:32.333 --> 1:45:33.416
Do you have a gun?

1:45:34.375 --> 1:45:35.291
Me?

1:45:35.375 --> 1:45:36.208
-You.
-I do.

1:45:36.291 --> 1:45:38.625
-Come with me.
-I've never done it before.

1:45:38.708 --> 1:45:42.083
-It's high time.
-I've been working on this for two years.

1:45:43.125 --> 1:45:44.291
If you have to.

1:45:46.583 --> 1:45:49.000
Might be nasty. I'll take another gun.

1:45:51.291 --> 1:45:52.416
We've got him.

1:45:55.625 --> 1:45:57.208
Nowakowski Oskar.

1:45:58.333 --> 1:46:02.000
Raised in an orphanage.
Convicted of theft twice.

1:46:02.083 --> 1:46:04.125
Clean for five years.

1:46:04.208 --> 1:46:08.166
Mother unknown.
Father died in a car accident.

1:46:11.625 --> 1:46:12.833
Carry me!

1:46:19.041 --> 1:46:20.083
Look, jellyfish.

1:46:29.625 --> 1:46:31.958
I've read about this.

1:46:34.708 --> 1:46:37.500
The robbery and your disappearance…

1:46:38.416 --> 1:46:39.791
It's not a coincidence.

1:46:43.583 --> 1:46:44.416
Maybe.

1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.125
The guy who you robbed…

1:46:50.458 --> 1:46:51.708
is not my dad.

1:46:53.250 --> 1:46:54.083
Really?

1:46:59.458 --> 1:47:00.875
You know I'm an orphan?

1:47:05.250 --> 1:47:08.166
The only memory I have of my parents…

1:47:10.333 --> 1:47:12.541
is this place, this beach.

1:47:19.708 --> 1:47:21.541
Don't you fucking move!

1:47:32.458 --> 1:47:34.583
-You'll scare her.
-On the ground.

1:47:35.166 --> 1:47:36.666
Hands on your head.

1:47:37.666 --> 1:47:39.833
Easy, Aneta. They're not armed.

1:47:39.916 --> 1:47:40.833
Stay out of it.

1:47:42.333 --> 1:47:45.250
You wanted to come?
Shoot him or I'll do it.

1:47:49.416 --> 1:47:50.875
What are you staring at?

1:47:53.625 --> 1:47:54.916
I remember you.

1:47:57.250 --> 1:47:58.291
I remember.

1:47:59.291 --> 1:48:01.875
Are you fucking insane?
It's not Wild Wild West!

1:48:01.958 --> 1:48:02.833
Talk, Chudy!

1:48:04.083 --> 1:48:06.333
You've got a great partner.

1:48:06.416 --> 1:48:08.458
-You like killing girls.
-Shut up!

1:48:08.541 --> 1:48:10.916
I remember you dragging her to the van.

1:48:11.708 --> 1:48:13.958
Are you fucking mad?!

1:48:24.958 --> 1:48:26.416
I'm not done with you yet.

1:48:27.166 --> 1:48:29.625
Come here, cocksucker.

1:48:29.708 --> 1:48:31.625
I'll blow your fucking head off.

1:48:33.708 --> 1:48:37.458
You put your make-up on. You make faces.

1:48:37.541 --> 1:48:39.916
You take selfies in your underwear.

1:48:40.708 --> 1:48:45.958
And it never occurs to you
that you're hurting people.

1:48:47.875 --> 1:48:49.791
A little birdie has escaped.

1:48:52.583 --> 1:48:54.250
Why are you doing this?

1:48:58.541 --> 1:49:01.208
You know how it feels
to have a kid taken away?

1:49:04.375 --> 1:49:05.708
Do you?

1:49:07.708 --> 1:49:09.833
When you're hugging your son…

1:49:14.166 --> 1:49:18.916
Your sweet little baby with blond curls…

1:49:20.708 --> 1:49:22.958
who you love the most in the world.

1:49:24.916 --> 1:49:26.458
And he takes him away,

1:49:27.250 --> 1:49:31.916
saying that you're too young to raise him,
because you're only 16 years old.

1:49:33.708 --> 1:49:38.166
And then disappears
with some slut from the disco.

1:49:38.250 --> 1:49:39.833
That's why I'm doing that.

1:49:41.583 --> 1:49:43.750
Oskar has the same mark.

1:49:48.791 --> 1:49:49.791
Oskar.

1:49:53.250 --> 1:49:55.541
Look at me.

1:49:57.583 --> 1:49:58.958
It's gonna be fine.

1:50:00.833 --> 1:50:01.875
It's gonna be fine.

1:54:59.958 --> 1:55:05.083
