00:00.023 --> 00:01.956
<i>Previously on The Borgias...</i>

00:02.694 --> 00:04.795
<i>We were attacked</i>
<i>from all sides.</i>

00:04.863 --> 00:06.330
<i>What should have been</i>
<i>a glorious victory</i>

00:06.398 --> 00:08.466
is an ignominious defeat.

00:08.567 --> 00:09.633
Cesare was in Florence.

00:09.735 --> 00:11.098
Why did he not come
to warn us?

00:11.199 --> 00:12.562
How could he have known?

00:12.630 --> 00:13.988
How could he not
have known?

00:14.089 --> 00:15.884
My brother, the hero.

00:15.952 --> 00:18.648
<i>Rumour has it Catherina</i>
<i>Sforza raised her skirts</i>

00:18.716 --> 00:20.614
and said "I can
have 10 more sons."

00:20.715 --> 00:22.116
Lies!

00:22.183 --> 00:24.950
<i>Do you know what is more</i>
<i>poisonous than failure?</i>

00:25.018 --> 00:26.785
Ridicule!

00:26.854 --> 00:29.293
Brother Bernadino.

00:29.361 --> 00:30.858
While the pope
still has a taster,

00:30.925 --> 00:33.492
my mission remains
in purgatory.

00:35.525 --> 00:37.259
God forgive us all.

00:37.327 --> 00:40.063
<i>We hear that fires</i>
<i>burn in Florence</i>

00:40.130 --> 00:42.399
<i>and that Savonarola</i>
<i>still preaches.</i>

00:42.467 --> 00:45.805
He says that visions are put
into his mind by angels.

00:45.872 --> 00:48.373
Well, that could give us
cause to burn him.

00:48.441 --> 00:51.541
<i>Calvino Pallavicini and his</i>
<i>good-for-nothing brother</i>

00:51.609 --> 00:53.709
<i>repose at our expense.</i>

00:53.777 --> 00:55.710
We would see a betrothal today!

00:55.778 --> 00:57.146
Your brother?

00:57.214 --> 00:59.448
It is your brother
who travels with you, yes?

00:59.516 --> 01:00.716
<i>Lucrezia.</i>

01:00.783 --> 01:02.617
<i>Are you saying yes</i>
<i>to my brother?</i>

01:04.253 --> 01:07.257
All praise.

01:08.959 --> 01:10.627
This wound
will not let me rest.

01:10.728 --> 01:12.062
What is it they're smoking?

01:12.130 --> 01:13.363
It is opium.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.431
Come, ease your pain.

01:15.499 --> 01:16.866
Perhaps we should
find someone else

01:16.933 --> 01:19.100
to lead the papal forces
in your stead.

01:19.168 --> 01:20.635
I defend this papacy;

01:20.703 --> 01:23.005
I defend this family
with my heart.

01:23.072 --> 01:26.641
Juan, you are in no fit state
to defend anything.

01:26.742 --> 01:28.442
Not even yourself.

<i>Make it absolutely clear</i>

03:40.308 --> 03:41.675
Your Holiness,
an urgent matter.

03:41.743 --> 03:42.976
Holy Father.

03:47.981 --> 03:49.148
What is this?

03:49.216 --> 03:50.683
Holiness -
Just one moment.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.285
Holy Father.

03:53.353 --> 03:55.320
I cannot marry
your daughter.

04:00.226 --> 04:04.429
We are the Pope of Rome

04:04.497 --> 04:09.767
and you tell us
you cannot marry our daughter?

04:13.505 --> 04:14.972
Why?

04:27.720 --> 04:29.087
Holy Father.

04:29.155 --> 04:32.657
We think we know what
you are about to say.

04:32.725 --> 04:34.226
I wish to marry
your daughter.

04:34.294 --> 04:35.628
What a revelation.

04:35.695 --> 04:38.130
And is our daughter
party to this proposal?

04:38.198 --> 04:40.065
Yes, I hope she is,
Holiness.

04:40.166 --> 04:41.467
You hope.

04:41.534 --> 04:43.736
Would it not have been
prudent to inquire

04:43.803 --> 04:46.405
before you apprehended us
in this manner?

04:47.807 --> 04:51.411
I am an honourable man,
Holiness.

04:51.478 --> 04:54.180
I humbly beg your blessing

04:54.248 --> 04:55.782
to marry your daughter
Lucrezia.

04:55.849 --> 04:57.750
We think you have lost sight
of your moorings, young sir.

04:57.818 --> 04:59.352
Your brother is
a man of means,

04:59.453 --> 05:00.954
a first son;

05:01.021 --> 05:04.157
he commands a vast fleet
of ships trading untold wealth.

05:04.225 --> 05:06.525
You are a second son,
command as far as we are aware

05:06.593 --> 05:07.927
no more than a paint brush.

05:07.994 --> 05:12.130
Holy Father!
What is it, Cardinal?

05:12.198 --> 05:14.599
Your taster,
Brother Bernadino.

05:14.667 --> 05:16.167
What of him?

05:16.235 --> 05:17.836
He is dead.

05:17.904 --> 05:19.204
How?
Poisoned?

05:19.272 --> 05:22.875
No, he drowned in the Tiber
whilst fishing.

05:22.943 --> 05:25.078
Well, how did that happen?

05:25.145 --> 05:26.513
It was an accident.

05:26.580 --> 05:27.847
Accident?

05:27.915 --> 05:30.450
Bodies are pulled from
the Tiber every day.

05:36.491 --> 05:38.191
God rest his soul.

05:38.259 --> 05:40.293
And damn yours!

05:40.361 --> 05:42.262
And yours!

05:42.330 --> 05:43.930
<i>And all of you!</i>

05:47.701 --> 05:49.435
<i>Thank you for your help.</i>

05:52.339 --> 05:54.541
Vanozza!

05:57.511 --> 05:59.179
Vanozza!

06:02.082 --> 06:03.716
Vanozza!

06:06.153 --> 06:08.287
Did you know of this?
Of what?

06:08.355 --> 06:09.756
That our daughter,
betrothed to one

06:09.824 --> 06:11.091
gives herself
to the brother?

06:11.158 --> 06:12.759
Lucrezia?
It's not possible.

06:12.860 --> 06:14.394
How could she be so foolish?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.029
With the help of those
around her, perhaps?

06:16.097 --> 06:17.664
What advice
did you give her?

06:19.968 --> 06:23.170
I merely said that
if she married to please you,

06:23.238 --> 06:25.739
she may yet love
to please herself.

06:25.807 --> 06:28.141
And you thought that wise?

06:28.209 --> 06:30.743
I married one of your choosing
to be free to love you.

06:30.811 --> 06:32.645
But you were not
the pope's daughter!

06:32.713 --> 06:35.381
Rodrigo, she will
love whom she chooses.

06:35.449 --> 06:37.083
She is a Borgia.

06:38.752 --> 06:40.487
I hear the Pallavicini
boys have gone.

06:40.554 --> 06:42.756
Yes, because you would marry
a pauper with a paint brush.

06:47.162 --> 06:49.030
I would have married
Calvino Pallavicini

06:49.098 --> 06:50.966
as you bid, dear father.

06:51.034 --> 06:53.069
But if I had followed my heart,

06:53.136 --> 06:55.137
I doubt I would have
married either of them.

06:55.205 --> 06:58.508
Oh, so,
the future of this family

06:58.609 --> 07:00.776
is in thrall to your heart?

07:02.546 --> 07:05.548
If it is,
it needs mending.

07:05.616 --> 07:07.850
Like my heart.

07:10.087 --> 07:14.089
Here lie the ashes
of countless treasures.

07:14.157 --> 07:17.559
Savonarola's Bonfire
of the Vanities.

07:17.627 --> 07:19.161
The fire burned for days.

07:19.228 --> 07:22.030
People added more to
keep the flames alive.

07:22.098 --> 07:24.065
The people of Florence
had a good life.

07:24.133 --> 07:27.102
How can this Savonarola
rob them of all this

07:27.169 --> 07:30.572
and yet still have them
clinging to his every word?

07:30.640 --> 07:33.342
If you can understand that,
Your Eminence,

07:33.410 --> 07:36.611
then you will have the key
to bring down the man.

07:40.917 --> 07:44.220
Break the spell,
break the man.

07:51.395 --> 07:53.696
Holiness,
your security is paramount.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.798
Therefore, until we find
a suitable recruit,

07:55.866 --> 07:57.233
I have decided
to take on the role

07:57.301 --> 07:58.935
of food taster myself.

07:59.002 --> 08:02.071
Oh!
Greater love hath no man.

08:02.172 --> 08:05.108
We will vet personally
those who you choose.

08:05.176 --> 08:06.510
They should all be
from holy orders.

08:06.577 --> 08:08.111
Pure in spirit.

08:08.179 --> 08:10.714
But now, Cardinal,
your attention, please.

08:12.351 --> 08:15.486
We will hold a ritual
in the basilica.

08:15.554 --> 08:17.688
Preparations should be made
in the next two days.

08:17.756 --> 08:19.790
An anathema.
An excommunication.

08:19.891 --> 08:21.692
Friar Savonarola.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.428
We have charged
Cardinal Borgia

08:24.496 --> 08:26.096
to silence him,

08:26.164 --> 08:27.797
to accuse him of heresy
in full view

08:27.865 --> 08:29.432
of the entire
populace of Florence.

08:29.534 --> 08:30.767
Whereas here in Rome,

08:30.835 --> 08:32.302
from the throne
of St. Peter's,

08:32.369 --> 08:35.971
we will condemn his soul
to the fires of Hell.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.928
These people trust their fates,

08:58.996 --> 09:02.965
their fortunes,
to the power of spells.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.535
Come.

09:05.636 --> 09:07.203
Savonarola understands

09:07.271 --> 09:09.873
that what haunts
a man's mind in the night

09:09.941 --> 09:11.441
is what rules him.

09:11.543 --> 09:14.912
He trades in the fear of hell.

09:21.653 --> 09:23.820
<i>Untie me!</i>

09:25.222 --> 09:26.622
<i>Untie me!</i>

09:34.163 --> 09:35.830
I tell you!

09:35.931 --> 09:37.732
Please!

09:37.833 --> 09:40.535
I've done nothing!

09:40.602 --> 09:42.904
Here is a different
kind of bonfire.

09:42.972 --> 09:44.973
Damn you all!

09:48.177 --> 09:50.479
God will punish you!

09:50.580 --> 09:53.548
What is her crime?

09:53.616 --> 09:55.550
She is a witch!

09:55.618 --> 09:59.620
<i>People believe she has the</i>
<i>power to cast them into Hell.</i>

09:59.688 --> 10:01.722
Fear.

10:01.790 --> 10:04.692
Fear of damnation

10:04.760 --> 10:06.661
<i>and the hope for a better</i>
<i>life in the next world.</i>

10:08.630 --> 10:10.397
<i>That is what</i>
<i>Savonarola promises.</i>

10:10.498 --> 10:12.666
He trades in miracles.

10:12.733 --> 10:16.369
Show him to be wrong,
<i>the man will burn...</i>

10:16.437 --> 10:18.839
...just like the witch.

10:18.906 --> 10:20.207
Damn you!

10:20.274 --> 10:22.476
<i>Damn your soul!</i>

10:24.079 --> 10:27.749
<i>God will punish you!</i>

10:27.816 --> 10:29.751
Burn, you witch!

10:31.221 --> 10:33.589
No!

10:36.494 --> 10:39.195
God will punish you!

10:46.837 --> 10:49.205
<i>Heathen!</i>
<i>Heathen!</i>

10:49.306 --> 10:51.574
<i>Black-hearted vixen!</i>

10:51.675 --> 10:53.976
Glorify us!
Purify her!

10:54.044 --> 10:56.645
<i>If angels can fall</i>
<i>from Heaven into Hell...</i>

10:58.114 --> 11:00.816
...then so can we all.
<i>Purify your soul!</i>

11:00.884 --> 11:03.285
<i>The demon waits to devour us.</i>

11:05.254 --> 11:07.222
Then we must go
wrestle with the demon.

11:09.192 --> 11:11.593
<i>Burn in hell!</i>

11:12.962 --> 11:14.496
<i>Protect us!</i>

11:16.299 --> 11:18.400
<i>Damnation for you!</i>

11:20.970 --> 11:22.504
<i>Damnation!</i>

11:26.008 --> 11:28.442
<i>Are fulfilled the</i>
<i>sayings of Isaiah -</i>

11:28.510 --> 11:33.580
<i>"They declare their sin as</i>
<i>Sodom, they hide it not-"</i>

11:33.648 --> 11:35.482
<i>Jeremiah,</i>

11:35.550 --> 11:39.219
"Thou hadst a whore's forehead,

11:39.287 --> 11:44.124
<i>thou refusedst to be ashamed."</i>

11:44.192 --> 11:48.496
You defend yourselves to
your soul's damnation!

11:50.533 --> 11:52.034
Girolamo Savonarola,

11:52.101 --> 11:55.004
I am Cardinal Cesare Borgia

11:55.071 --> 11:57.939
and I come bearing the
authority of His Holiness,

11:58.007 --> 12:00.375
Alexander the Sixth,
Pope of Rome!

12:00.443 --> 12:05.246
Here is the Pope's messenger,
his bastard son!

12:05.314 --> 12:08.949
One of many, we hear,
fathered across the nation.

12:11.886 --> 12:13.219
Brother Savonarola,

12:13.287 --> 12:16.789
you stand accused
of defying papal orders

12:16.857 --> 12:19.393
to cease your
heretical preaching

12:19.460 --> 12:21.761
and of refusing to
present yourself in Rome

12:21.829 --> 12:23.864
to bend your knee
to our Holy Father.

12:23.932 --> 12:28.636
I recognize
no such power!

12:28.704 --> 12:32.807
My authority comes
from a higher being

12:32.875 --> 12:36.044
than your godless pope
in Rome!

12:37.413 --> 12:39.881
Then we must put it
to the test.

12:42.618 --> 12:44.352
A trial by fire.

12:46.555 --> 12:49.356
The whole of Florence
can be judge and jury!

12:50.992 --> 12:56.862
I challenge you,
here in this temple of God.

12:56.930 --> 13:00.433
As Christ, our Saviour,
walked on water,

13:00.500 --> 13:05.305
if you can walk through fire,
untouched,

13:05.372 --> 13:08.608
then I will follow you
into the flames.

13:08.675 --> 13:10.643
God will protect you, Father!

13:10.711 --> 13:12.646
Show us, Father!

13:18.519 --> 13:20.087
Children.

13:20.188 --> 13:23.091
God speaks to me.

13:23.192 --> 13:25.827
I am not afraid.

13:25.928 --> 13:27.463
I will...

13:27.530 --> 13:30.967
...walk through the fire.

13:31.034 --> 13:35.972
And, he, he that follows me
will burn.

13:46.516 --> 13:49.017
Do you remember
the old days?

13:49.118 --> 13:52.453
Do you?

13:52.554 --> 13:55.122
We were friends.

13:55.223 --> 13:57.391
We did everything together.

14:00.730 --> 14:03.865
Now look what pain
you cause me.

14:03.933 --> 14:07.469
Have I betrayed you or
have you betrayed me, eh?

14:07.537 --> 14:09.906
Answer me, you bastard.

14:13.511 --> 14:17.180
As usual, ah!

14:17.248 --> 14:20.550
You have nothing to say -

14:20.618 --> 14:24.288
...but still
you rule my life.

15:15.039 --> 15:19.342
Wherefore in the
name of God, the All-powerful,

15:19.410 --> 15:22.013
Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost,

15:22.080 --> 15:25.516
of Blessed Peter,
Prince of the Apostles,

15:25.584 --> 15:28.086
and of all the saints,

15:28.154 --> 15:31.423
in virtue of the power
which has been given us

15:31.491 --> 15:35.327
of binding and loosing
in Heaven and on earth.

15:37.297 --> 15:41.033
May God be my witness!
<i>We believe in you!</i>

15:41.100 --> 15:46.237
<i>I testify that Alexander</i>
<i>Sextus of Rome</i>

15:46.305 --> 15:48.172
is no pope!

15:50.008 --> 15:53.610
He is no Christian!

15:53.678 --> 15:56.980
And believes in no God!

16:00.418 --> 16:08.626
I will walk through this fire
to show I speak God's truth!

16:10.663 --> 16:13.232
<i>We deprive the Friar,</i>

16:13.300 --> 16:16.803
<i>Girolamo Savonarola,</i>
<i>himself,</i>

16:16.870 --> 16:19.271
<i>and all his abettors</i>

16:19.339 --> 16:21.273
of the communions

16:21.341 --> 16:25.743
of the body and
blood of our Lord.

16:25.811 --> 16:31.882
We separate him from
the society of all Christians,

16:31.950 --> 16:37.087
we exclude him from the bosom
of our Holy Mother, the Church

16:37.188 --> 16:40.891
in Heaven
and on earth...

17:01.047 --> 17:04.182
<i>We declare him excommunicated</i>

17:04.282 --> 17:06.784
<i>and anathematized,</i>

17:06.852 --> 17:10.354
<i>and we judge him</i>
<i>condemned to eternal fire</i>

17:10.422 --> 17:16.526
<i>with Satan and his angels</i>
<i>and all those damned,</i>

17:16.594 --> 17:20.530
<i>so long as he will not burst</i>
<i>the fetters of the demon,</i>

17:20.598 --> 17:23.633
<i>do penance,</i>
<i>and satisfy the Church.</i>

17:26.470 --> 17:28.971
Ah! Ah!

17:29.039 --> 17:34.110
<i>We deliver him to Satan</i>
<i>to mortify his body,</i>

17:34.178 --> 17:35.545
Burn.

17:35.646 --> 17:38.548
<i>that his soul may be saved</i>

17:38.649 --> 17:41.552
on the day of judgment.

17:44.823 --> 17:47.759
<i>Fiat, fiat.</i>

17:53.266 --> 17:55.567
Fiat!

18:00.406 --> 18:02.207
<i>He burns!</i>

18:20.056 --> 18:21.990
<i>Betrayer!</i>

18:39.877 --> 18:42.212
<i>We gave everything for you!</i>

18:58.731 --> 18:59.931
<i>Get him.</i>
<i>Give him to us!</i>

18:59.998 --> 19:02.300
Take him to Rome.

19:09.874 --> 19:12.041
You will
present yourself to the pope

19:12.142 --> 19:14.243
as a Franciscan.

19:14.311 --> 19:19.315
You will be asked why you
would accept such a task.

19:19.416 --> 19:21.217
And what is your answer?

19:21.284 --> 19:22.752
Because
I would gladly die

19:22.819 --> 19:25.421
in the service
of the Pope of Rome.

19:25.522 --> 19:28.657
And you will mean
every word you say.

19:28.725 --> 19:30.892
I will, Father.

19:32.862 --> 19:35.597
If hired,
you will bide your time.

19:35.698 --> 19:38.567
You will choose your moment.

19:38.635 --> 19:42.605
You may have one chance
and one chance only

19:42.706 --> 19:45.708
to deliver a fatal dose.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.078
Fatal for both of us.

19:54.353 --> 19:56.254
May God be with you.

20:24.684 --> 20:27.352
There is something
I'd like to say.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.792
It's long been my suspicion
that my brother...

20:33.860 --> 20:36.528
...has congress
with my angelic sister.

20:39.799 --> 20:41.366
<i>The issue of such a union</i>

20:41.434 --> 20:45.337
<i>would produce a demon</i>
<i>to devour the world.</i>

20:47.841 --> 20:49.876
<i>And me.</i>

20:56.250 --> 20:58.351
No one is listening.

21:03.992 --> 21:07.261
No one is listening.

21:11.267 --> 21:12.901
<i>What's the matter with him?</i>

21:12.969 --> 21:14.736
Has he been drinking?
Get up!

21:16.272 --> 21:17.672
Take him to our apartments.

21:17.740 --> 21:19.807
<i>Let him sleep it off.</i>

21:19.875 --> 21:21.942
Ah!

21:22.010 --> 21:24.044
Father.
Father...

21:24.112 --> 21:26.480
Take your hands off me!
The friar, Savonarola,

21:26.581 --> 21:28.381
he's been disgraced.

21:28.449 --> 21:30.216
The people of Florence celebrate.
Ah!

21:30.284 --> 21:32.318
We greet this good
news with caution.

21:32.386 --> 21:34.253
Has he confessed?
He will.

21:34.321 --> 21:36.122
He is being hauled
to Rome as we speak.

21:36.190 --> 21:38.257
Oh, so all is not yet won.

21:38.325 --> 21:40.926
Father, when the rack embraces
him, he will confess.

21:41.028 --> 21:42.495
But he must
be seen to be guilty,

21:42.563 --> 21:43.930
hence the need for
his confession.

21:44.031 --> 21:45.598
The people must understand

21:45.666 --> 21:48.534
that no one is at liberty to
impugn the office of the papacy.

21:48.602 --> 21:50.069
No one!

21:50.137 --> 21:52.539
And he must sign
his confession and then...

21:52.606 --> 21:54.107
And then we will
put him to the fire.

21:54.175 --> 21:56.009
A public spectacle.

21:56.110 --> 21:57.944
And no relics must remain.

22:01.216 --> 22:03.483
Holiness, I have examined
the applicants

22:03.551 --> 22:06.586
for the post of food taster
and reduced them to three.

22:06.654 --> 22:08.856
A trinity, good.
Come observe.

22:13.561 --> 22:15.729
Rise.

22:18.968 --> 22:20.301
A Cistercian.

22:20.402 --> 22:22.202
We are aware.

22:23.671 --> 22:25.473
Show us your hands.

22:35.283 --> 22:38.151
You would save us
from poison,

22:38.219 --> 22:40.320
but poison us
with grime.

22:40.388 --> 22:42.689
We till the soil,
Holy Father.

22:42.757 --> 22:44.557
As the apostle James.

22:47.093 --> 22:49.061
Hands.
A Dominican.

22:49.162 --> 22:51.129
Yes, Holy Father.

22:54.467 --> 22:57.868
We are acquainted with
your brethren in Florence.

23:09.783 --> 23:11.684
Show us your hands.

23:17.292 --> 23:20.694
Why do you desire
to serve us?

23:20.761 --> 23:24.430
I will gladly die to preserve
the life of His Holiness,

23:24.531 --> 23:27.032
secure in the knowledge
that the Lord Jesus Christ

23:27.100 --> 23:33.439
stands behind me and
His light shines through me.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.508
What is your name?

23:35.609 --> 23:38.243
Antonello.

23:38.344 --> 23:40.045
Antonello.

23:40.113 --> 23:43.882
You are a Franciscan,
young martyr?

23:43.983 --> 23:45.784
Yes, Father...

23:45.852 --> 23:47.853
Holiness.

23:56.329 --> 23:59.898
Our confessor
was a Franciscan.

24:02.634 --> 24:05.069
We are fasting.

24:05.170 --> 24:09.340
Are you prepared for
a diet of sardines?

24:09.407 --> 24:14.445
As his Holiness eats,
so shall I.

24:14.546 --> 24:18.182
Then prepare to starve
in our service.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.984
Give the other two a meal.

24:20.052 --> 24:22.186
Send them on their way.

24:36.970 --> 24:39.538
The man is a bear,
Eminence.

24:39.639 --> 24:42.107
Brand him, gouge him,
stretch him to the limit.

24:42.175 --> 24:45.811
Believe me,
this man will not break.

24:45.879 --> 24:47.446
He must be seen to be guilty.

24:47.547 --> 24:49.248
He must confess.

24:51.151 --> 24:53.018
Welcome to Rome.

24:55.155 --> 24:56.889
Reflect,

24:56.956 --> 25:01.293
had you forsworn your heresies,
embraced Rome,

25:01.361 --> 25:03.762
the Holy Church would
be embracing you now.

25:03.830 --> 25:09.902
Lies ooze from your mouth
like pus from a dead horse.

25:09.969 --> 25:14.673
All that awaited me was
the Castel Sant'Angelo.

25:14.741 --> 25:17.377
Well, it is all
that awaits you now.

25:17.444 --> 25:19.479
True confession

25:19.547 --> 25:22.849
can only be extracted
by torture;

25:22.917 --> 25:25.652
is that not so?

25:25.753 --> 25:27.021
That is so.

25:27.088 --> 25:31.793
Torture is hard work
for a soft stomach.

25:31.860 --> 25:34.830
Are you sure
you're up to it?

25:34.897 --> 25:37.799
It is not me
who will be tortured.

25:37.866 --> 25:42.603
Have no doubt,
you will sign your confession.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.738
By then you will be
an old man.

25:50.043 --> 25:51.844
Lent is over.

25:51.912 --> 25:53.945
Our 40 days in the wilderness
have passed.

25:54.013 --> 25:59.085
We have deemed it God's will
that we continue our fast.

25:59.152 --> 26:01.854
<i>But Your Holiness.</i>
<i>The bells ring.</i>

26:01.922 --> 26:04.357
Christ the Redeemer is risen.

26:04.425 --> 26:06.193
<i>Surely, Easter</i>
<i>is a time</i>

26:06.260 --> 26:07.694
for celebration.

26:07.762 --> 26:09.563
<i>You may eat,</i>
<i>Cardinal Piccolomini.</i>

26:09.631 --> 26:13.667
But the Pope of Rome
will abstain.

26:13.768 --> 26:16.004
<i>Alone, if needs be,</i>

26:16.071 --> 26:21.108
<i>until God smiles upon</i>
<i>St. Peter's once more.</i>

26:21.176 --> 26:22.676
Sardines, if you please.

26:22.744 --> 26:25.312
No, no, no wine.
We just drink water.

26:36.890 --> 26:40.559
My preference is to eat
sardines, Your Holiness.

26:40.627 --> 26:43.395
Oh, we welcome your company,
Cardinal Versucci.

26:47.368 --> 26:49.669
The water is pure,
Your Holiness.

26:49.737 --> 26:51.772
Hm.

26:51.873 --> 26:54.041
So we shall drink water.

26:54.109 --> 26:56.310
And water alone.

26:59.414 --> 27:04.417
Benedictus, Benedicat per
Christum Dominum Nostrum.

27:04.485 --> 27:06.519
Amen.

27:39.388 --> 27:41.989
Are you an assassin?

27:42.057 --> 27:45.359
No, I am Thisbe,
come to whisper my love.

27:45.427 --> 27:49.696
Would you have us
be your Pyramus?

27:49.764 --> 27:53.700
That story ended tragically:
he fell upon his sword.

27:53.768 --> 28:01.440
No, but I would still whisper
my love into your ear.

28:01.541 --> 28:05.344
Oh.

28:05.412 --> 28:07.313
This abstinence
grows tiresome.

28:07.380 --> 28:11.683
We've spent so long
in the wilderness.

28:11.751 --> 28:13.818
Why do you persist
in punishing yourself

28:13.919 --> 28:16.354
when your labours bear fruit?

28:16.455 --> 28:21.293
It is God that punishes,
not we ourselves.

28:21.360 --> 28:26.899
Yes, but God has given his
blessing to your work.

28:26.966 --> 28:29.268
A bathhouse has been restored.

28:29.336 --> 28:32.438
An orphanage will
bear your name.

28:32.540 --> 28:35.108
The poor of Rome have bread.

28:38.245 --> 28:41.548
Your papacy is a blessing
to all.

28:41.615 --> 28:46.453
You are doing God's will.

28:46.554 --> 28:50.256
Is that not sign enough?

28:50.324 --> 28:52.525
Yes.

28:52.593 --> 28:54.894
Maybe you're right.

28:54.962 --> 28:58.365
We've been thinking
too much of ourself.

29:08.608 --> 29:10.609
There's one other blessing
you must confer.

29:12.946 --> 29:15.013
There is?

29:17.783 --> 29:19.817
Lucrezia's son.

29:19.885 --> 29:21.853
Your grandson, Giovanni.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.123
He needs the holy sacraments
of baptism.

29:26.458 --> 29:28.893
Giovanni, yes, of course.

29:28.961 --> 29:31.630
His welfare is our duty,

29:31.697 --> 29:33.732
both in this world
and the next.

29:36.669 --> 29:40.939
We would not have that angel
condemned to purgatory.

29:44.177 --> 29:46.646
Nor this angel.

30:01.161 --> 30:03.195
Ahhh!

30:14.573 --> 30:16.374
Are you spying?

30:16.442 --> 30:20.679
We are rejoicing at
such a beauteous sight.

30:22.082 --> 30:24.851
The pope rejoices
once more?

30:24.918 --> 30:27.320
We have been in
the wilderness, my love.

30:27.388 --> 30:29.689
For our sins.

30:29.790 --> 30:31.658
But it would be a sin

30:31.726 --> 30:34.495
to condemn little Giovanni
to that wilderness as well.

30:34.563 --> 30:37.465
Do you mean-
We would see him baptized.

30:37.533 --> 30:40.235
Ah.
It is long past the time.

30:40.336 --> 30:43.138
Hey, sh, sh, sh.
He shall be named

30:43.206 --> 30:45.774
and blessed in the eyes
of God for all to see.

30:45.875 --> 30:47.776
It is my prayer.

30:47.877 --> 30:50.145
And we shall have festivities

30:50.213 --> 30:53.882
worthy of such a beautiful
Madonna and child.

30:53.950 --> 30:56.618
And Cesare must
be the godfather.

30:56.719 --> 30:58.054
Yes.

30:58.155 --> 31:00.856
Yes.

31:00.924 --> 31:02.225
Sh-sh-sh-sh...

31:04.328 --> 31:09.065
Giovanni ego te baptizo

31:09.166 --> 31:12.535
in nomine Patris,

31:12.636 --> 31:18.974
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

31:19.042 --> 31:21.077
Amen.
Amen.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.521
Why wait so long
to bless this bastard, eh?

32:36.588 --> 32:39.323
Bastard yourself,
Juan Borgia.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.526
Thanks to you,
holy mother.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.460
Take care not to
stand too close.

32:43.528 --> 32:45.963
God knows what might
rub off on you.

32:46.031 --> 32:49.833
God knows why
you're even here.

32:49.934 --> 32:54.638
My father discarded
you long ago.

32:54.739 --> 32:57.006
What happened to you,
Juan?

32:57.074 --> 32:59.209
You were such
a lovely child.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.220
A drink, if you please,
Little Brother.

33:10.288 --> 33:11.823
Water, of course,
Holy Father?

33:11.890 --> 33:14.025
No, no, no, wine.
We would have wine.

33:17.130 --> 33:20.031
Take care; we would not
have you spill the wine.

33:24.069 --> 33:29.272
<i>It comes from our vineyards</i>
<i>in Spain, Valencia.</i>

33:29.340 --> 33:31.942
Too precious to spill.
Taste it; you will see.

33:33.878 --> 33:37.380
I only know, Holy Father,
that it is wine.

33:39.116 --> 33:40.750
Drink a little more.

33:46.023 --> 33:47.657
Let's see your eyes.

33:47.725 --> 33:49.660
Ah, not a trace of red.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.495
Pour.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.431
We are done
with fasting.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.400
We would celebrate the baptism
of our grandson

33:56.468 --> 33:58.736
with an abundance of wine.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.839
Father.
Ah, Lucrezia.

34:00.906 --> 34:03.542
I would toast you

34:03.609 --> 34:05.744
and our grandson
Giovanni.

34:07.047 --> 34:08.414
He is tired, Nurse.

34:09.683 --> 34:11.417
Father, I have a gift for you.
What?

34:11.485 --> 34:13.286
For me?
A dance.

34:13.353 --> 34:15.655
Nice.
Angels and Virgins.

34:30.937 --> 34:32.605
Oh.

34:32.672 --> 34:42.214
[♪]

34:44.550 --> 34:55.824
[♪]

34:55.827 --> 35:03.300
[♪]

35:03.367 --> 35:04.868
<i>Angels.</i>

35:04.936 --> 35:07.871
No, flesh and blood,
Brother, as you well know.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.373
Don't pretend
that nothing stirs

35:09.441 --> 35:12.143
beneath that Cardinal's
skirt of yours.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.313
Tell me, is it true what people
are chanting and singing,

35:14.381 --> 35:15.714
as our father said?

35:15.815 --> 35:17.516
"Ten more sons"?

35:17.584 --> 35:20.386
Would you start
another brawl with me?

35:20.454 --> 35:22.988
And spoil the idyll of
this beautiful dance?

35:23.090 --> 35:24.891
Never.

35:26.127 --> 35:28.061
It was a foolish insult.

35:28.129 --> 35:30.798
It cost her son his life.

35:35.838 --> 35:38.172
Why do you shake your head?

35:38.240 --> 35:41.075
Because it's not true.
Her son lives.

35:41.143 --> 35:43.244
He can't have lived.
I saw him hang.

35:43.312 --> 35:45.546
What you did not see
is Don Hernando de Caballos

35:45.614 --> 35:47.448
saved him and brought
him here to Rome.

35:47.549 --> 35:49.784
So where is he now?

35:49.851 --> 35:53.454
Back at Forli.
With his mother.

35:53.555 --> 35:56.090
So why bring him to Rome?

35:56.158 --> 35:58.827
He had an audience.
With his Holiness, the Pope.

36:02.632 --> 36:06.368
I see your purpose here,
your pathetic, fervent hope.

36:06.436 --> 36:09.372
You want to inhabit my shoes.

36:09.473 --> 36:12.909
Wear my armour.
Carry my sword.

36:14.579 --> 36:17.881
But what you don't realize
is that I am the prodigal son.

36:17.949 --> 36:20.050
And our father is never wrong.

36:20.118 --> 36:24.087
I am the light of his life!

36:24.155 --> 36:26.690
You must resign yourself,
Cesare.

36:26.758 --> 36:29.192
For you will end your life
in a clerical skirt.

36:33.698 --> 36:35.533
<i>Brava! Brava!</i>

36:48.713 --> 36:50.347
Sister...

36:50.415 --> 36:52.282
So, finally,
the bastard has a name,

36:54.185 --> 36:57.921
blessed by our Holy Father,
and saved from damnation.

36:57.989 --> 37:02.192
And you, dear brother, will
you be saved from damnation?

37:02.260 --> 37:04.027
The angels smile on me.

37:04.095 --> 37:06.130
Please don't.

37:06.231 --> 37:07.765
One day you'll realize

37:07.833 --> 37:09.534
that everything I've done
has been for your own good.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.636
If you had tried to marry
that waster from Genova,

37:11.704 --> 37:13.371
the one with
the paint brush...

37:14.907 --> 37:16.674
I would have taken
good care of him.

37:16.742 --> 37:18.810
For the good of the family,
no doubt.

37:20.212 --> 37:22.080
Always.

37:23.382 --> 37:26.818
Like you took care of Paolo?

37:26.886 --> 37:28.587
A stable boy.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.290
For the good of the family.

37:32.358 --> 37:34.125
Exactly so.

37:34.193 --> 37:37.162
Everything I do
is for the family.

37:37.230 --> 37:39.964
Were it not for our father's
affection of your bastard son,

37:41.133 --> 37:44.034
I'd have tossed that piglet
into the Tiber at birth.

37:44.102 --> 37:46.036
That's the only
baptism it deserves.

37:46.137 --> 37:48.138
We are all bastards.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.341
You, me, our brothers.

37:50.409 --> 37:52.510
We are all bastards.
Yes...

37:52.578 --> 37:55.279
Perhaps.

37:55.347 --> 37:58.315
But we are Borgia bastards.

38:00.552 --> 38:02.687
And there, dear Sis,
lies the difference.

38:07.059 --> 38:08.793
Hello, little piggy,

38:08.894 --> 38:10.962
time for a little dance,
I think.

38:12.031 --> 38:13.331
Leave my baby!

38:13.432 --> 38:15.132
Juan, leave my baby alone!

38:15.233 --> 38:17.068
No! No! No!

38:20.539 --> 38:22.240
Leave my baby alone!

38:26.545 --> 38:29.214
Sh, sh, sh.

38:59.979 --> 39:02.080
The Pope of Rome!
Can you believe it?

39:08.688 --> 39:10.722
Can you imagine!

39:14.760 --> 39:16.895
Here, take my hand.

39:19.965 --> 39:21.700
Poison.

39:23.336 --> 39:24.803
Tell me about poison.

39:27.339 --> 39:30.008
It kills with no hope
of reprieve.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.443
I would happily kill tonight.

39:34.347 --> 39:36.548
And break your father's heart?

39:36.649 --> 39:38.684
Would that be the consequence?

39:38.751 --> 39:41.386
Indeed.

39:41.454 --> 39:43.989
He loves his errant son,
does he not?

39:44.090 --> 39:45.724
More than he loves
his dutiful one.

39:45.792 --> 39:47.993
Well, then, love is blind.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.161
Blind and deaf and dumb.

40:00.706 --> 40:02.440
No killing then.

40:03.742 --> 40:06.810
Hearts may yet be broken.

40:06.878 --> 40:09.012
But not yours.

40:19.154 --> 40:20.922
Ten more sons!

40:23.526 --> 40:28.463
<i>♪ Ten more, ten more,</i>
<i>ten more sons! ♪</i>

40:33.270 --> 40:35.004
<i>Forgive us, my lord.</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>

40:35.105 --> 40:36.739
Sorry.

40:46.384 --> 40:48.285
Father, we must discuss
our brother.

40:50.088 --> 40:51.622
He is hurtling towards ruin.

40:51.690 --> 40:54.025
And he will drag this
whole family with him.

40:59.565 --> 41:03.468
You loved him once.
You must love him again.

41:03.536 --> 41:05.736
Must I?

41:05.804 --> 41:07.571
Will love make him
a better man?

41:15.513 --> 41:17.748
Help him...

41:17.816 --> 41:20.017
...through
his dark night.

41:21.786 --> 41:23.821
Don't let envy rule your heart.

41:25.791 --> 41:28.492
So I am my brother's keeper?
Yes.

41:29.728 --> 41:31.229
He needs you.

41:31.330 --> 41:35.933
As counsel, as support...

41:36.034 --> 41:37.735
...as cardinal.

41:50.682 --> 41:53.017
He needs you.

41:56.922 --> 41:59.590
Come on, say it again.
"Ten more sons."

41:59.658 --> 42:01.959
Ten-ten more sons!
And again!

42:02.027 --> 42:04.228
Ten-ten more...
Say it!

42:04.295 --> 42:06.863
You think...

42:06.965 --> 42:08.832
...this is wise, my lord?

42:08.900 --> 42:10.767
Where would you put the body?

42:10.835 --> 42:13.403
Take your hand off me
or you're a dead man.

42:13.504 --> 42:16.606
You press -

42:16.674 --> 42:18.708
You press in the wrong spot,
my lord.

42:18.809 --> 42:20.977
You press here.

42:21.044 --> 42:22.945
She is dead in a moment.

44:03.243 --> 44:04.910
visiting your home
this night?

44:06.980 --> 44:09.082
I would consider your
answer carefully.

44:12.487 --> 44:15.456
Yes, he is here.

44:17.926 --> 44:21.095
Tell him his brother
would speak with him.

Have you come to beg
forgiveness for your insult?

44:59.799 --> 45:01.933
I have.

45:02.034 --> 45:04.035
You are already forgiven.

45:17.718 --> 45:23.556
Imagine that you are sitting
on the edge of a vast well,

45:23.624 --> 45:25.358
your feet dangling
over the edge.

45:28.129 --> 45:31.031
Moving slowly around the walls
of the well, like smoke,

45:31.099 --> 45:34.302
there's a world of
wonders reaching down,

45:34.369 --> 45:38.305
as far down as the eye can see.

45:38.373 --> 45:44.778
These wonders are your life.

45:44.846 --> 45:48.414
I glimpse us, Cesare,

45:48.515 --> 45:52.051
two brothers in harmony,
walking together.

45:55.622 --> 45:58.424
All these visions
are the work of tears.

45:58.525 --> 46:00.559
Tears of blood.

46:02.630 --> 46:05.465
No.

46:05.532 --> 46:07.334
Tears of the poppy.

46:08.670 --> 46:11.605
Everything is there
for you to see.

46:11.706 --> 46:14.108
Birth.

46:14.176 --> 46:16.511
And, of course, your death.

46:19.348 --> 46:22.884
But the miracle is
that there's no pain.

46:25.587 --> 46:32.893
I have been in pain,
Cesare, for all my years.

46:32.994 --> 46:36.863
And you-
you are in pain, Brother.

46:36.964 --> 46:38.665
I can feel it.

46:41.570 --> 46:43.805
Yes.
I am in pain.

46:45.741 --> 46:47.976
You would end your pain?

46:50.680 --> 46:52.415
Yes.

46:54.118 --> 46:55.885
And I would end yours.

47:00.624 --> 47:02.492
Ah!

47:07.631 --> 47:09.432
My brother!

47:11.468 --> 47:14.069
What is this?

47:14.171 --> 47:15.971
Only God forgives.

47:17.140 --> 47:19.341
Ah!

47:22.579 --> 47:25.414
We're Borgias!
We never forgive.

47:25.482 --> 47:27.917
Ahh!

47:29.654 --> 47:31.688
I stand in awe, your Eminence.

47:31.756 --> 47:33.790
You killed your father.
