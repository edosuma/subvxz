01:50.720 --> 01:52.234
He said
four minutes precisely.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.550
<i>Non, non, non.</i>

02:08.120 --> 02:09.110
Quickly.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.234
Two
perfect eggs this time, no?

02:26.600 --> 02:27.750
Ah.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.070
Hmm.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.320
Maybe.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.394
I blame the chicken.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.077
Why do hens lay eggs
of different sizes?

02:55.240 --> 02:56.390
<i>It's not you, mon ami.</i>

02:56.480 --> 02:58.153
<i>These are two
perfectly good oeufs.</i>

02:58.280 --> 02:59.270
Mr. Poirot...

02:59.400 --> 03:01.073
I've got three religions
bent on riot.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.760
If you're going to perform
one of your miracles,

03:02.880 --> 03:04.109
the time is now.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.914
<i>Have the eggs. Allons-y!</i>

03:17.800 --> 03:19.393
Poirot!

03:20.960 --> 03:23.270
Sorry for the, um...

03:26.960 --> 03:28.792
It is not the, uh...

03:30.120 --> 03:33.591
It is the imbalance of the...

03:41.280 --> 03:42.475
Right.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.790
That's better.

03:43.920 --> 03:44.876
Excuse me.
Coming through.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.360
Make way, please.
Excuse me.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.154
Please call for the accused.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.954
The rabbi...

03:52.800 --> 03:54.280
the priest...

03:55.160 --> 03:56.640
and the imam.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.833
It is like the old joke, yes?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.151
The rabbi, the priest,
and the imam.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.157
Forgive me,
I am Belgian.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.993
So, let us begin.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.834
In the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre above us...

04:16.000 --> 04:18.834
<i>three representatives meet
under the supervision...</i>

04:19.000 --> 04:20.593
<i>of the Chief
Inspector of Police</i>

04:20.680 --> 04:23.832
<i>to discuss a divided timetable
for market use.</i>

04:24.840 --> 04:26.638
<i>One hour after this
tense meeting...</i>

04:26.720 --> 04:29.838
<i>a priceless relic
is found to be stolen.</i>

04:30.880 --> 04:36.717
It is said, one of these
three men has stolen it.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.834
The police find no pieces
of evidence at all.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.720
I find one.

04:43.880 --> 04:48.716
<i>On the meticulously
well-kept wall of a fresco...</i>

04:48.880 --> 04:53.716
<i>a single crack
from an indelicate climb...</i>

04:53.880 --> 04:58.511
<i>with a hard-soled shoe
or perhaps a boot.</i>

05:03.560 --> 05:06.234
So, ladies and gentlemen,
we must ask...

05:06.400 --> 05:09.393
who stands to benefit
from the crime.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.233
Our three holy men
live humbly.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.835
They're thin-soled shoes poor.

05:18.560 --> 05:23.396
Sudden riches
and rubies would be...

05:23.560 --> 05:26.439
too conspicuous, yes,
to enjoy. They do not gain.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.434
At this point, we need an
armed guard at the south gate.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.793
Thank you very much.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.235
No, the only one...

05:33.400 --> 05:38.236
who benefits from the theft
and the unrest it causes...

05:38.440 --> 05:42.070
is a man whose office
I had searched this morning...

05:42.240 --> 05:43.560
as I waited,
I have to tell you,

05:43.640 --> 05:45.393
rather disappointedly
upon my breakfast.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.916
Difficulty with eggs.
You don't need to know this.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.551
A man who is paid lavishly
to keep order in Jerusalem.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.234
I mean, of course,

05:53.320 --> 05:55.915
the Chief Inspector
of the Police.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.756
A man who does not wish
to lose a well-paid post...

05:58.960 --> 06:00.519
when there is discussion

06:00.600 --> 06:02.592
among the local peoples
of self-governance...

06:03.440 --> 06:08.231
who does wear boots, and who,
I believe, now does regret...

06:08.400 --> 06:11.313
inviting me to
consult on this case.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.312
How dare you accuse me!

06:13.480 --> 06:14.755
Please, Sergeant...

06:15.640 --> 06:17.632
did you search
the office as I asked?

06:17.800 --> 06:18.950
Uh, yes, sir.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.589
And did you find
what I said you might?

06:21.760 --> 06:23.956
Uh, yes, sir.
Just as you said.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.190
<i>Merci.</i>

06:47.600 --> 06:48.590
Halt!

07:06.520 --> 07:07.840
You need
to deliver that, Captain.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.070
It should be through
first thing in the morning.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.355
Very good, sir.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.750
Luggage is on board, sir.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.353
I won the right to escort you
to your boat.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.192
To Stamboul, then?

07:21.280 --> 07:24.000
Will you be back
to London straight off?

07:24.840 --> 07:29.676
I am tired, and I have earned
myself a little holiday.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.200
I want to look at paintings

07:31.280 --> 07:33.875
and have too much time
on my hands.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.192
You are staring.
Does it stop?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.793
It's just...

07:39.960 --> 07:41.713
How did you know
it was him, sir?

07:41.800 --> 07:43.792
From just a tiny crack
on the wall.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.475
I have the advantage...

07:46.640 --> 07:49.553
I can only see the world
as it should be.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.554
And when it is not,
the imperfection stands out...

07:52.720 --> 07:56.999
like the nose
in the middle of a face.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.355
It makes
most of life unbearable.

08:00.520 --> 08:04.912
But it is useful
in the detection of crime.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.311
But it's as though
you see into their hearts

08:07.400 --> 08:09.676
and divine
their true natures.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.236
And whatever people say,

08:12.320 --> 08:15.233
there is right,
there is wrong.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.039
There is nothing in between.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.240
We must part here.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.073
Oh, no, sir, I'm to
escort you on the ferry.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.234
<i>Au revoir, mon capitaine.</i>

08:25.320 --> 08:27.039
We must never meet again.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.157
Could you straighten your tie,
please? Just a little.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.079
Yes.
That is perfect.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.352
Final passengers, please!

08:37.679 --> 08:38.875
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.876
Will be fixed soon.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.514
But, will it be
fixed in time?

08:44.600 --> 08:45.670
We are working!

08:45.760 --> 08:48.036
I have a connection
in Stamboul.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.271
Leaves tomorrow at seven.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.877
There's a very ill patient
waiting for me in London.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.800
I am a doctor.

08:58.440 --> 08:59.635
Doctor.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.113
I am a doctor.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.954
I am shouting at you
in English,

09:06.080 --> 09:08.720
and now I'm doing it
louder and slower.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.793
Very silly, forgive me.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.634
May I help? Let me help.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.311
I know your mustache.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.472
From the papers.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.756
You're the detective,
Hercules Poirot?

09:23.280 --> 09:27.752
<i>Hercule Poirot. I do not slay
the lions. Mademoiselle.</i>

09:29.920 --> 09:31.320
<i>Mary Debenham, monsieur.</i>

09:31.400 --> 09:33.153
I'll forget a name
but never a face.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.312
Not yours, anyway.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.800
You come from Baghdad?

09:38.320 --> 09:41.677
It's true. No detail
escapes his notice.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.638
Your ticket.
Ah.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.517
I might also ask you if you
enjoyed your time there...

09:47.680 --> 09:49.080
as a governess?

09:49.760 --> 09:52.832
The chalk on your sleeve
and the geography primer.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.517
A governess or a
cartographer. I made my gamble.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.120
I always begin them
with geography...

10:01.280 --> 10:03.590
and monster them till they
have the world down cold.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.831
They may get lost in life...

10:06.040 --> 10:08.271
but I'll be damned if they
don't know where they are.

10:10.280 --> 10:14.354
Well, our chains are free.
Right on time.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.115
I feel so free
out here on the water.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.317
I wish I could enjoy it.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.880
We should be
out of this, Mary.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.229
Not now.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.312
When it's all over.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.960
When it's done.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.391
Then, nothing can touch us.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.717
<i>Ah,
my holiday begins here.</i>

11:19.480 --> 11:24.157
I can see the soul of the city
in these humble breads.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.836
The world insists
on destruction, yet here...

11:27.960 --> 11:31.715
masterpieces are baked
to order every day.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.359
Monsieur Poirot!

11:33.440 --> 11:36.114
Mohammed!

11:37.840 --> 11:38.830
Mohammed, my friend...

11:39.400 --> 11:41.198
you are an artist.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.158
Ah! My friend!

11:43.320 --> 11:44.800
Sorry.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.679
Here. Come, come.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.035
Don't mind us,
we're just looking

11:48.120 --> 11:49.520
for a place to have
a private argument.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.193
It should take
some 20 minutes or so...

11:51.280 --> 11:52.270
at which point we will both

11:52.360 --> 11:53.794
come to an agreement,
or at least I will.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.155
<i>Monsieur Bouc!</i>

11:55.640 --> 11:57.871
Poirot! In the kitchen?

11:58.040 --> 11:59.997
Well, of course,
this man will sniff out

12:00.080 --> 12:01.480
a perfect pastry
faster than he catches...

12:01.640 --> 12:02.630
a jewel thief.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.200
<i>Mon ami!</i>

12:04.360 --> 12:05.840
Now, I am no longer
a policeman.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.798
I cannot bail you out
when this goes badly, eh?

12:09.240 --> 12:11.311
This is my dear, old friend,
the esteemed...

12:11.480 --> 12:13.153
Poirot, who I knew
before the esteem.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.469
Hercule Poirot, this is...

12:14.640 --> 12:15.630
A prostitute.
She is.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.440
I am. Bouc, you did not tell
me you had famous friends.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.510
We're friends because

12:19.600 --> 12:20.590
I'm the only person
who never asks him...

12:20.680 --> 12:23.354
any questions about his cases,
because I don't care.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.239
And he never judges me
for being a terrible person.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.356
Indeed you are.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.080
<i>Madame, Bouc, please
join me for a drink, yes?</i>

12:29.240 --> 12:30.640
You only have me
for an hour.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.678
I ride on the Orient Express
at seven,

12:32.760 --> 12:34.433
official director business.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.159
Uncle pays me absurdly

12:36.240 --> 12:37.640
to stay onboard
his gorgeous train...

12:37.800 --> 12:38.916
and far away from him...

12:39.080 --> 12:40.196
at the home office...

12:40.400 --> 12:41.834
consigned to wine and dine

12:41.920 --> 12:43.149
handsome officials
for all eternity.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.589
There is an art to nepotism.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.717
And you are
its Michelangelo!

12:46.800 --> 12:47.790
Mr. Poirot.

12:47.880 --> 12:48.870
Are you a prostitute as well?

12:49.080 --> 12:50.480
Certainly not.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.630
Is this man bothering you?

12:51.800 --> 12:52.995
He is about to.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.594
You are from
the British consulate.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.353
I am, sir.
It is the Kassner case.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.280
Why, yes.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.238
I was correct
in certain predictions?

13:00.720 --> 13:02.313
Quite.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.000
I do not need
to read the telegram.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.116
Oh, how fun.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.760
Did someone cheat, or die?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.434
Unfortunately, both.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.400
Someone has...

13:12.600 --> 13:15.195
interrupted my
longing for rest.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.670
It appears that I must travel
with you tonight, Bouc.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.752
Can you find me a cabin
on the Orient Express?

13:19.920 --> 13:20.990
My friend...

13:21.160 --> 13:22.992
I may not be good for much,
but I sure as hell

13:23.080 --> 13:24.400
can get you a bed
on my train...

13:24.560 --> 13:25.994
in the dead of winter.
Three days...

13:26.200 --> 13:30.035
free of care, concern
or crime. You will love it.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.835
<i>Mademoiselle, it has
been a pleasure. Sir.</i>

13:33.520 --> 13:35.318
Your luggage
has been collected

13:35.400 --> 13:36.959
and your expenses paid.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.873
You will be met at Calais...

13:39.040 --> 13:41.430
and then escorted to Dover,

13:41.520 --> 13:43.671
and then by rail
to London Victoria.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.234
I would like to formally

13:45.320 --> 13:46.549
express gratitude.
Please, don't speak.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.433
You make it worse.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.592
Here's a tip for you, pal.
Thank you, Mr. Marquez.

13:57.760 --> 13:58.830
I didn't even carry
your luggage.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.150
Oh, I had a good week.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.919
We celebrate
when fortune smiles,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.798
and we share
the good fortune.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.031
Remember to say nice things
about us Americans, huh?

14:11.720 --> 14:12.836
No!

14:13.000 --> 14:14.036
Hey, stop!

14:18.960 --> 14:20.189
<i>Monsieur, bonsoir.</i>

14:20.360 --> 14:21.555
For you, Mr. Ratchett,

14:21.640 --> 14:23.472
the best table in the house.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.273
Just here, sir.
The very best table.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.193
No, I want that one.

14:37.480 --> 14:40.439
Hey, Masterman.
You got everything?

14:40.600 --> 14:42.671
Kind of you to inquire,
Mr. MacQueen.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.592
I do not make mistakes.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.670
Oh, my goodness!
It's Count Andrenyi.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.910
Come, come, come.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.834
I saw you dance
at the Monte Cristo.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.718
Could I take your photograph?

15:05.120 --> 15:06.713
Please, my face, no!

15:29.960 --> 15:31.314
Sorry.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.275
The Simplon Orient Express...

15:44.440 --> 15:48.070
with stops in Sofia, Niš,
Belgrade, Vinkovci, Brod...

15:48.240 --> 15:50.436
with transfers
to Bucharest, Zagreb,

15:50.520 --> 15:52.193
Trieste, Venezia,
Milan, Lausanne...

15:52.360 --> 15:54.511
Dijon, Paris,
Boulogne, Calais...

15:54.720 --> 15:56.074
with connection
to Dover and London,

15:56.200 --> 15:57.350
leaves in fifteen minutes!

15:57.560 --> 15:59.631
This way, Michel!
Precious cargo.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.359
I need
a first-class compartment.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.438
Give special care
to my friend, Michel.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.040
I want him pampered
like a zoo panda.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.190
<i>But Monsieur Bouc,
we are fully booked.</i>

16:06.280 --> 16:07.316
There's no space left.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.198
Then we make space.
He can have the number eleven.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.232
The eleven is always kept
open for official use.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.720
It's very comfortable.

16:12.880 --> 16:13.836
Eleven is taken.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.240
The Austrian professor
booked it two days ago.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.436
There is not one first-class

16:16.560 --> 16:17.630
sleeper car
on the whole train?

16:17.800 --> 16:18.790
Negative, sir.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.077
Second-class?
There's no space left at all.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.879
<i>Mademoiselle Debenham.</i>

16:23.080 --> 16:24.958
Mr. Poirot,
are you joining us?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.112
It depends
who wins this debate.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.600
Have all the passengers
arrived?

16:28.800 --> 16:31.315
All but one. Mr. Harris.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.834
"All passengers
must check in

16:32.920 --> 16:34.957
"at least one half hour prior
to time of departure...

16:35.120 --> 16:36.759
"or their seat
may be forfeit."

16:36.920 --> 16:39.389
The half hour has passed.
The seat is forfeit.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.319
<i>Please take
Monsieur Poirot's luggage</i>

16:41.400 --> 16:43.676
to number three
with Mr. MacQueen.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.911
<i>Merci, Bouc.
Enjoy, my friend.</i>

16:46.080 --> 16:47.480
<i>Welcome, sir.
Merci.</i>

16:50.320 --> 16:52.915
Number three is unlucky.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.396
Oh!

16:56.480 --> 16:58.836
<i>Apologies, madame.
I meant no disrespect.</i>

16:59.000 --> 17:01.799
Well, you could try to mean
a little.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.717
One thing about train travel,

17:04.800 --> 17:06.757
you're always
knocking into somebody.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.076
It's wonderful.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.596
Though, I am looking forward
to getting back.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.713
Travel is fine for spicy food,
mosques, meeting men.

17:13.880 --> 17:17.191
But eventually, you just
miss your own bed.

17:20.119 --> 17:25.148
I've been accused
of husband hunting abroad.

17:26.359 --> 17:28.113
Well, I can't,
in all honesty, deny it.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.396
I like my time alone, I do.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.631
But a lady has certain needs

17:32.720 --> 17:35.440
that deserve to be met
if she has any money...

17:35.600 --> 17:37.432
and preferably,
on a regular basis.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.113
Oh!

17:40.600 --> 17:44.435
Oh, my!
Fire in the kitchen!

17:44.600 --> 17:46.398
<i>Farewell, madame.</i>

17:47.360 --> 17:48.350
Good evening.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.430
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

17:50.400 --> 17:51.675
Number nine.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.633
<i>Good evening.
Bonsoir, bonsoir.</i>

17:53.760 --> 17:55.319
<i>How you doing?
Bonsoir.</i>

17:55.560 --> 17:56.994
<i>Oh. Excusez-moi.</i>

17:57.160 --> 17:58.799
No, after you.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.155
<i>Merci, merci.</i>

18:02.280 --> 18:03.475
Ah number three.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.598
You are Mr MacQueen?

18:06.760 --> 18:08.592
Yeah. I think you might
have the wrong berth.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.190
Uh...

18:10.320 --> 18:12.471
Sorry, is there a problem sir?

18:12.840 --> 18:14.115
No, no problem.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.510
The train is full.

18:15.680 --> 18:20.471
I think that we are,
how do you say... "bunkies."

18:22.160 --> 18:23.230
Really?

18:23.400 --> 18:26.199
I am equally disappointed
in you. This is nice.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.639
Come along, darlings.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.670
No.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.670
No.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.350
This?

19:15.920 --> 19:18.310
Why am I not yet unpacked?

19:20.280 --> 19:21.873
Five minutes to departure.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.997
Final call for passengers!

19:32.960 --> 19:34.758
Shall we brush you?

19:34.920 --> 19:37.674
What the hell
is taking them so long?

19:37.840 --> 19:39.513
Soon as we get out of here,
have them make up the bed.

19:39.680 --> 19:40.830
It's already arranged,
Mr. Ratchett.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.310
No, I want the bed made.
And bring my Dictaphone.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.195
Dogs on the table.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.476
Most disgusting thing
I've ever seen in my life.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.233
Yes, sir.
I want you to get MacQueen...

19:50.400 --> 19:52.960
and have him bring every
receipt from the Milan sale.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.395
I want you to get it done.
Yes, sir.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.119
I want you to get it done now.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.390
Did I say get it done now?
Right away, sir.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.871
"Better watch yourself."

21:08.240 --> 21:09.833
Your coffee, Mr. Ratchett.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.595
Who did this?

21:14.760 --> 21:16.592
I can't say, sir.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.954
Good evening,
Mrs. Hubbard.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.634
Hello there,
Mr. Masterman.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.989
Well, hello.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.840
Eyes linger any longer,
I'll have to charge rent.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.073
I'll pay.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.000
Mmm. Have another drink.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.354
Are you insulted?

22:03.440 --> 22:05.636
Hmm. Disappointed.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.154
Some men have a good look.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.118
All they have to do is...

22:11.280 --> 22:12.634
keep their mouth shut,

22:12.720 --> 22:14.598
and they can take home
any prize they want.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.958
Still, the mouth opens.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.554
Is everything all right,
Mrs. Hubbard?

22:37.720 --> 22:40.758
You have a strong intuition,
I know.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.833
My second husband
used to say just so.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.993
Hold that, it was my first.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.150
Yeah.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.038
Brightest man I ever met.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.318
Face like a turnip,
but I loved that turnip.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.832
It was nice to talk.

23:05.360 --> 23:06.999
Good night.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.239
Monsieur Poirot?

23:25.400 --> 23:27.198
<i>Entrez,
Pierre Michel.</i>

23:29.600 --> 23:30.590
<i>Voilà.</i>

23:30.720 --> 23:32.632
When you take supper...

23:32.800 --> 23:33.870
<i>I will move Monsieur MacQueen</i>

23:33.960 --> 23:35.076
<i>into Monsieur Bouc's
compartment.</i>

23:35.160 --> 23:36.753
<i>You travel first class,
monsieur.</i>

23:38.240 --> 23:40.755
<i>Ah, impeccable. Merci.</i>

23:41.680 --> 23:42.670
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

23:42.840 --> 23:43.751
...and the eggs?

24:06.560 --> 24:07.880
Good afternoon.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.315
Ah, Mrs. Hubbard.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.834
Good afternoon.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.675
There we are.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.672
Compliments
of the Orient Express.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.274
Thank you, Mr. Bouc.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.592
I am here
for all of your needs.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.114
No, thank you.
I do not drink.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.590
It does not
agree with you?

24:24.760 --> 24:27.559
Sin does not agree with me.

24:27.720 --> 24:30.952
Vice is where the devil
finds his darlings.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.112
We should no longer speak.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.633
Good afternoon.

24:36.800 --> 24:41.352
<i>Monsieur.
How about a apéritif?</i>

24:41.520 --> 24:43.239
I regret I have
an appointment

24:43.360 --> 24:45.352
with the director
of the train.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.910
He was gonna leave anyway.

24:48.080 --> 24:51.073
<i>Please, sir.
Madame, madame.</i>

24:51.240 --> 24:53.630
<i>Madame, madame.</i>

24:54.240 --> 24:55.913
All settled in?

24:57.160 --> 24:59.880
<i>Ah, merci!
As advertised.</i>

25:00.040 --> 25:03.875
And yet, the best things
on the train are not food.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.390
You know
there's something about...

25:08.560 --> 25:10.233
a tangle of strangers
pressed together

25:10.360 --> 25:11.714
for days on end,
with nothing in common...

25:11.880 --> 25:13.872
but the need to go
from one place to another...

25:14.040 --> 25:16.077
then never to see
each other again.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.431
Boredom plus
anonymity plus a...

25:18.600 --> 25:20.592
constant, gentle rocking.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.274
With your hobbies, you will
never amount to anything.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.920
God, I hope so.
Hmm.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.434
Order me the fish.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.436
Um, exchange grouper for sole,

25:33.560 --> 25:36.075
escarole for the potato,
and...

25:37.080 --> 25:38.434
the beef sauce
for the velouté.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.395
<i>Garçon, that sounds superb.
The same for me.</i>

25:45.800 --> 25:47.473
The Princess Dragomiroff.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.953
You know, if I ever were
to marry for money,

25:50.040 --> 25:51.554
I'd marry for
that much money.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.949
I brushed Dalia this morning.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.760
No, you tortured
my darling doggy.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.149
I asked you to brush her.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.471
Are you still enjoying
your Dickens?

26:00.640 --> 26:02.472
<i>Very much, mon ami.</i>

26:02.640 --> 26:04.552
You know, with your books
and your capers,

26:04.640 --> 26:06.313
you are missing out
on romance.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.949
Romance never
goes unpunished.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.994
There was, uh...

26:15.080 --> 26:17.800
There was someone once.

26:29.320 --> 26:33.155
I would prefer, in the future,
to be sat not with that man.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.750
Like should be seated
with like.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.797
We are not alike.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.274
Not all of us
are so concerned

26:40.360 --> 26:42.795
with the separateness
of races, Professor.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.191
It is out of respect
for all kinds

26:45.320 --> 26:47.789
that I prefer
to keep them separate.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.959
To mix your red wine
and the white

26:51.040 --> 26:52.997
would be to ruin them both.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.192
I like a good rosé.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.752
Hey, how you doing?
Would you mind...

27:47.920 --> 27:49.354
if I joined you?

27:50.600 --> 27:52.796
Dessert is an indulgence...

27:52.960 --> 27:56.920
and I feel kinda silly
and stupid indulging alone.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.549
I am at my happiest alone.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.475
But...

28:01.640 --> 28:04.439
for a small piece
of your fragelité,

28:04.520 --> 28:05.590
please join me.

28:05.760 --> 28:09.197
Oh, with pleasure.
Excuse me, another fork?

28:11.880 --> 28:13.837
I've been trying to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Poirot.

28:13.960 --> 28:14.950
<i>Merci.</i>

28:15.600 --> 28:19.389
I never ever sat so close
to fame before.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.597
No, I tell a lie.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.634
Once, I was on a bus
with Ty Cobb.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.430
Ball player, Detroit.
Ah.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.953
Would you mind if I have the
little curly bit at the top?

28:34.120 --> 28:36.396
You're an odd bird there.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.636
You're a strange,
peculiar man.

28:39.800 --> 28:40.870
I am of an age

28:40.960 --> 28:42.917
where I know what I like
and what I do not like.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.959
What I like,
I enjoy enormously.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.476
What I dislike,
I cannot abide.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.155
For instance,
the temporary pleasantries

28:51.280 --> 28:54.000
before what is determined
to be a business discussion.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.120
You're fun.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.476
All right.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.831
I would like
to offer you a job.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.677
"The avenger of the innocent."

29:05.760 --> 29:06.989
It's what they call you
in the papers.

29:07.160 --> 29:08.480
And you are an innocent?

29:08.680 --> 29:10.273
I'm a businessman.

29:10.440 --> 29:15.276
I'm an art dealer.
I mean, I'm new to it.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.279
But my beginner's luck
has panned out.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.753
Relics, antiquities.

29:20.920 --> 29:24.118
Rugs, weird. Orientals.

29:25.080 --> 29:29.518
I'm new to the game,
so I got the amateur eyeball.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.515
But I got a little problem
with these, uh...

29:33.680 --> 29:35.751
so-called appraisers.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.872
You can't trust
a one of 'em.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.992
Some of my customers...

29:43.040 --> 29:44.190
they buy a piece...

29:44.360 --> 29:48.479
they find out that they're
not exactly original...

29:48.680 --> 29:50.034
which is hardly my fault...

29:50.200 --> 29:53.876
if a Kashan silk scarf
is a fake.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.110
Right? Huh?

29:55.280 --> 29:56.509
<i>C'est bon.</i>

29:58.880 --> 30:01.395
But I've managed to make
a few enemies, is the thing.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.712
I got a few letters,
people making threats.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.360
I think, most likely,
it's the Italians.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.954
I sold them a set of
Oriental carpets in Milan.

30:14.240 --> 30:18.075
And the buyers weren't
so happy with the provenance.

30:19.320 --> 30:22.233
And they want their money back
with interest, you know?

30:22.320 --> 30:23.310
Italians.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.394
A guinea's a guinea.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.996
And then comes along
the genius detective.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.389
Me?

30:31.600 --> 30:34.991
Yes, you. Hercules Poirot.
Hercule.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.315
Um...

30:38.520 --> 30:39.840
Here's what I'd like to do.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.038
I would like to hire you
to watch my back...

30:43.200 --> 30:45.271
until I get someplace safe.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.751
It's easy money for you.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.752
And it's peace of mind
for me, you know?

30:50.920 --> 30:52.593
I understand.
Good.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.750
I refuse.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.877
I'm sorry? That's bad.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.352
Maybe I didn't make
myself clear enough.

31:00.520 --> 31:04.514
You see,
someone's out to get me.

31:04.680 --> 31:08.560
And I know I'm not the best
guy born, not by a long shot.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.353
And if there's a world
after this one,

31:10.440 --> 31:12.716
I will face judgment
just like you.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.790
But...

31:16.400 --> 31:19.757
I ain't in no goddamn
rush to do it.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.112
You're holding a gun on me?
No.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.920
Not you. On the world.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.470
I exist in the world.
Do not point a gun at me.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.313
How's ten thousand
sound for a week?

31:29.480 --> 31:31.472
It's a generous offer,
Mr. Ratchett. I must decline.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.630
Fifteen thousand?

31:32.720 --> 31:33.870
You didn't hear me. I decline.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.474
Oh, I get it.

31:36.400 --> 31:41.156
It's not flashy enough for
the great Hercules Poirot, huh?

31:41.320 --> 31:42.390
No flashbulbs...

31:42.560 --> 31:43.550
You sell fakes to gangsters.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.279
You're suffering
the consequences.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.557
I detect criminals.
I do not protect them.

31:49.120 --> 31:51.237
So you say "no"
to my dirty money.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.312
I say "no" to you,
Mr. Ratchett.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.596
Business with the gun, right?
Is that what it was?

31:56.760 --> 31:58.956
It is far more personal
than that.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.672
I do not like your face.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.992
If you will excuse me.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.152
You liked my cake,
didn't you?

32:10.360 --> 32:11.760
The cake was excellent.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.275
Have a pleasant afternoon,
Mr. Ratchett.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.035
Thank you.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.270
Ooh! Cold.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.356
Hmm.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.276
My sweet Katherine.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.795
My love.

33:19.400 --> 33:22.234
Mr. Dickens.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.114
Mr. Ratchett?

33:46.280 --> 33:48.033
Mr. Ratchett?

33:48.280 --> 33:49.396
It's nothing.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.072
Very good sir.

33:52.120 --> 33:52.632
Good night.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.235
Mrs. Hubbard?

34:15.320 --> 34:17.232
It's always Mrs. Hubbard.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.880
Mrs. Hubbard.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.352
Did we die?

35:15.520 --> 35:18.194
Ladies and gentlemen,
the train has been derailed.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.360
Are you all right,
Mr. Marquez?

35:20.520 --> 35:22.432
I'm fine. Thank you.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.510
You'll be
safest in your cabins.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.000
Mr. Bouc will speak
to you all...

35:25.160 --> 35:26.196
in the morning.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.515
Please, you will be safest
in your cabins.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.875
Of course.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.872
Are we gonna die?

35:36.240 --> 35:37.390
Oh...

35:39.560 --> 35:41.358
My Katherine.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.517
My beautiful...

36:28.640 --> 36:30.711
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am afraid

36:30.800 --> 36:33.315
that our train is still
unable to go anywhere.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.550
Yeah, except down.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.313
How long are we supposed
to just sit here?

36:36.480 --> 36:38.870
Yes, someone must
be doing something.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.919
Of course I am doing
something. I am doing nothing.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.515
Precisely two hours
and ten minutes ago,

36:44.600 --> 36:46.637
<i>when we did not arrive
in Brod as scheduled...</i>

36:46.800 --> 36:48.871
<i>the station master will have
surmised our situation...</i>

36:49.040 --> 36:51.714
<i>and already dispatched a team
to excavate the engine...</i>

36:51.880 --> 36:54.111
<i>clear our path,
and send us on our way.</i>

36:54.280 --> 36:55.475
<i>Until then, I assure you...</i>

36:55.640 --> 36:59.031
we will all be made warm
and fed and comfortable.

36:59.720 --> 37:00.836
We could walk.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.674
We could die
of exposure trying.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.752
I have a connection to make.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.799
My boat sails day after
tomorrow from France.

37:09.280 --> 37:12.557
Without you, I'd wager.
Or me in London.

37:12.720 --> 37:16.236
I hold you accountable for
my loss of time, Mr. Bouc.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.039
Madam, you cannot hold me
accountable for the weather.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.271
Of course I can.
You're the one here.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.557
And my conference
in Turin?

37:22.760 --> 37:24.956
And I was to meet at
the auto factory in Sochaux.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.870
Yes, some things,
they are in God's hands.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.432
It is not for us to say...

37:30.640 --> 37:34.031
if we deserve to arrive safely
at our destination...

37:35.200 --> 37:39.035
or if, like Lucifer,
we must fall.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.470
Breakfast for you,
Mr. Ratchett.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.957
<i>Ah, Bonjour,
Mr. Masterman.</i>

37:57.480 --> 37:58.880
There is a problem?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.474
I can't say, sir.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.074
Mr. Ratchett?

38:11.120 --> 38:13.396
Excuse me.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.794
That is cold air.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.917
Please bring Monsieur Bouc
immediately,

38:20.000 --> 38:21.957
and also Dr. Arbuthnot.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.319
Good God!

38:44.480 --> 38:46.836
Touch nothing else,
only the body.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.391
My God,
this is horrible.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.069
First the snow, now...

38:55.240 --> 38:56.356
I'll have to meet
with the police

38:56.440 --> 38:58.159
and make some statement
in some grimy station.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.437
And a man has died.

39:01.320 --> 39:02.754
And a man has died.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.037
He was stabbed.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.350
Long, straight-edged knife.

39:06.520 --> 39:08.113
Multiple stab wounds,
some shallow,

39:08.240 --> 39:09.720
some cut clean through muscle.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.314
Left-hand side
or right-hand side?

39:11.480 --> 39:13.199
That's the thing.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.113
It appears the killer

39:15.200 --> 39:17.556
maybe closed his eyes
and struck blind.

39:17.720 --> 39:21.157
Can you estimate
the time of death?

39:21.320 --> 39:23.676
It's hard
to say with the window open...

39:23.880 --> 39:26.759
but my best guess
is between midnight and 2:00.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.200
But no one went
in his compartment then.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.396
I sat in my seat all night.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.473
I would have seen if someone
went in. It's impossible.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.032
Thank you, Doctor. Please,
return to the dining car.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.192
Michel, secure this carriage.

39:40.440 --> 39:41.840
Poirot.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.077
I need your help, my friend.

39:50.480 --> 39:51.914
You have to find
who did this.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.196
Please, I implore you,

39:53.280 --> 39:54.873
on behalf
of the Orient Express.

39:55.000 --> 39:55.990
When the police arrive,

39:56.120 --> 39:57.190
we can present them
with the case closed.

39:57.280 --> 39:59.317
You are the only one
who can save me.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.631
<i>Your faith touches me,
mon cher.</i>

40:01.720 --> 40:03.473
But I must have this rest.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.678
Well, think of it as a little
beachside puzzle.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.758
That's nothing to your mind!

40:08.920 --> 40:10.991
You look up the antecedents
of the passengers.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.310
You establish
their bona fides.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.551
Then you do what you do.
You... You... You...

40:14.760 --> 40:19.073
You sit in a chair
and you eat your cake...

40:19.240 --> 40:21.391
and you think until
the solution presents itself.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.353
What else are you going to do
while we sit here in the snow?

40:23.560 --> 40:24.630
Without constant
stimulation,

40:24.720 --> 40:26.120
your little gray cells
will starve and die.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.555
You think that is what I do?
I sit in a chair...

40:27.720 --> 40:28.710
and I have
a little piece of cake,

40:28.800 --> 40:29.950
and then I come up
with a great idea?

40:30.120 --> 40:31.474
I don't know what you do.
I have my Dickens.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.233
Damn your Dickens!

40:34.080 --> 40:35.230
If we leave this
to the police,

40:35.320 --> 40:36.470
they will choose a culprit...

40:36.640 --> 40:38.711
right or wrong,
and they will hang him.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.075
Most probably Mr. Marquez...

40:40.240 --> 40:42.391
for no other reason
than his name is Marquez.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.200
Or Dr. Arbuthnot for
the color of his skin.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.718
You are the only one
who can bring justice.

40:56.960 --> 40:57.950
Let me have a map
of this coach.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.030
Of course.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.110
Every passport.
Anything.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.078
Interviews arranged
with all of our passengers.

41:02.240 --> 41:05.278
Evidence, order and method,
until one culprit emerges.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.278
I do not approve
of murder, my friend.

41:07.480 --> 41:08.470
Every day, we meet people

41:08.560 --> 41:09.596
the world could
do better without...

41:09.680 --> 41:10.909
yet we do not kill them.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.720
We must be better
than the beasts.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.910
So let us find this killer.

41:18.120 --> 41:19.634
What's going on?

41:22.200 --> 41:24.999
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to, um...

41:25.160 --> 41:27.800
It appears that our bad luck
has worsened.

41:28.000 --> 41:28.990
That is...

41:29.160 --> 41:32.153
A passenger has died
on the train.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.959
<i>Monsieur Ratchett.</i>

41:43.200 --> 41:44.839
Looks like they
got him after all.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.957
You assume
he was killed?

41:47.120 --> 41:48.679
No, no.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.514
I just mean he was
in perfectly good health.

41:51.680 --> 41:53.160
He had his enemies,
that's all.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.352
Indeed, he did.
He was murdered.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.794
Good God. Murder, here?

41:59.960 --> 42:01.189
<i>Alas, madame.</i>

42:01.360 --> 42:03.192
God rest his soul.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.038
Someone was rummaging
around my cabin

42:06.120 --> 42:07.395
in the middle of the night.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.552
Nobody would believe me.

42:11.640 --> 42:12.676
What is going on?

42:12.880 --> 42:13.950
As we are snowbound,

42:14.040 --> 42:15.269
I have elected
to take the case...

42:15.440 --> 42:17.955
<i>and find for my friend,
Monsieur Bouc, the criminal.</i>

42:18.120 --> 42:19.759
And why you?

42:20.880 --> 42:22.758
My name is Hercule Poirot...

42:22.920 --> 42:25.560
and I am probably the greatest
detective in the world.

42:26.080 --> 42:27.309
I will speak
to all of you in time.

42:27.440 --> 42:28.760
For the moment...

42:28.920 --> 42:30.070
I must recommend
that you remain

42:30.160 --> 42:31.560
in your compartments
with the doors locked.

42:31.720 --> 42:33.393
I feel like a prisoner here.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.950
It is
for your own safety.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.237
If there was a murder...

42:38.400 --> 42:40.392
then there was a murderer.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.278
The murderer is with us...

42:43.800 --> 42:47.111
on the train, now.

42:57.760 --> 43:00.992
The doors between coaches
were locked at night, hmm?

43:01.160 --> 43:02.992
Absolutely.
Done myself.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.230
The train's
been searched.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.549
There's no one hiding
on it or under it.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.030
We can therefore
limit our investigation

43:08.120 --> 43:10.555
to the occupants
of the Calais coach.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.632
Bouc, you will assist me.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.439
As the only traveler
who slept in another coach...

43:14.600 --> 43:16.592
you are the only one
who is not a suspect.

43:25.200 --> 43:28.671
Mr. MacQueen, is this
really the time for drinking?

43:28.840 --> 43:30.593
My boss is dead.

43:30.760 --> 43:32.399
I'm out of a job,

43:32.480 --> 43:34.119
and you're looking at me
like I did it.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.509
We make no accusations.

43:35.680 --> 43:36.955
You knew him,
so from here

43:37.040 --> 43:38.360
we must glean
the essential facts.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.352
Were you his relative?

43:41.160 --> 43:43.994
No, his secretary.

43:45.480 --> 43:49.838
Book his travel,
order his steaks.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.229
The man ate more steak

43:51.320 --> 43:53.437
than I've ever seen
in my entire life.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.751
He was in antiques.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.479
He had no qualification
for it,

43:57.560 --> 43:58.550
not the eye
or the languages.

43:59.280 --> 44:02.671
Truth is, he had no head
for business, accounting...

44:02.840 --> 44:04.160
none of it.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.515
I took care of everything.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.149
How long were you
in his employ?

44:08.320 --> 44:11.154
Twenty days shy of a year.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.950
Prohibition
wasn't to my taste...

44:16.920 --> 44:19.913
so I found myself overseas,
and in debt.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.795
I'm a lawyer by education...

44:25.960 --> 44:27.792
not disposition.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.111
I was downright awful at it.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.155
You were fond of him?

44:32.320 --> 44:34.710
I was fond of his money.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.996
Ratchett was crude...

44:36.560 --> 44:41.271
<i>demanding, insulting,
and most likely a felon.</i>

44:41.440 --> 44:43.272
<i>When did you
last see him?</i>

44:43.440 --> 44:45.352
<i>It must have been
just after 10:00.</i>

44:45.520 --> 44:47.591
He called me in to go
over our sales in Italy.

44:47.760 --> 44:50.355
Milan,
the sale of forgeries?

44:50.520 --> 44:52.432
Yeah, yeah.

44:52.520 --> 44:55.160
He wanted to look over
the accounts.

44:55.320 --> 44:57.073
I had to translate
everything...

44:57.240 --> 44:58.276
as the contracts
were in French

44:58.360 --> 44:59.840
and he didn't speak a word.

45:00.680 --> 45:02.034
<i>And when we stopped
at Vinkovci...</i>

45:02.200 --> 45:04.795
<i>I struck up a chat with
the colored doctor, Arbuthnot.</i>

45:04.960 --> 45:07.077
<i>And we had a couple of drinks,
stretched our legs.</i>

45:07.240 --> 45:08.230
<i>He had some...</i>

45:08.400 --> 45:12.110
odd opinions about Stalin
I had to turn around.

45:12.280 --> 45:13.794
I don't hold
a man's race against him,

45:13.880 --> 45:15.872
but I don't often
take to Britishers.

45:16.840 --> 45:18.399
When did your party end?

45:18.560 --> 45:21.359
He left just after 2:00.

45:21.520 --> 45:22.954
Did you know
of any specific enemies

45:23.040 --> 45:24.713
Ratchett might have had?

45:24.880 --> 45:26.234
Gosh.

45:26.400 --> 45:27.754
Pick a number.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.640
He confided
he had been threatened?

45:30.800 --> 45:32.519
He got a couple
of nasty letters.

45:32.680 --> 45:35.991
I have them if you like.
Some, anyway.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.311
He tore up the rest.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.238
Threw them into the fire.

45:43.760 --> 45:44.750
That's them.

45:50.040 --> 45:51.997
<i>Merci, Mr. MacQueen.</i>

45:52.160 --> 45:53.150
Uh, thank you.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.390
If we have
any further questions,

45:54.520 --> 45:56.318
we will call for you again.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.229
Have you considered
the Latin man?

46:01.440 --> 46:03.909
Marquez. Hell of a guy.

46:05.160 --> 46:08.676
And, well, you know,
his kind...

46:08.840 --> 46:11.275
they don't have
the same distaste for murder,

46:11.360 --> 46:13.033
historically speaking.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.034
You said you don't hold
a man's race against him.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.350
I suppose...

46:18.600 --> 46:20.592
depends on the race.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.519
And he was doing so well.

46:28.720 --> 46:30.439
You think it's MacQueen?
Too early to say.

46:30.640 --> 46:31.676
I admit, I cannot see him

46:31.760 --> 46:33.035
stabbing a man twelve times
in a frenzy.

46:33.200 --> 46:34.634
Not sober, anyway.
Who did it then?

46:34.800 --> 46:36.393
I do not know yet.
It is time we ask.

46:36.600 --> 46:38.478
Ask who?
The victim.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.919
He has
twelve stab wounds

47:17.000 --> 47:18.593
and, as Arbuthnot said,
they are patternless.

47:18.760 --> 47:19.910
If the doctor is guilty...

47:20.080 --> 47:21.400
he certainly did not
let it influence

47:21.480 --> 47:22.596
his responsibilities.

47:22.760 --> 47:24.831
Hey, the watch.
Stopped at 1:15.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.673
Now that agrees with the
doctor on the time of death.

47:26.840 --> 47:28.797
Hmm. It is possible,
yes. Certainly possible.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.030
I don't
quite understand.

47:30.120 --> 47:31.315
I do not understand,
myself.

47:31.440 --> 47:32.590
I understand nothing at all.

47:32.760 --> 47:34.638
If you look
at these two wounds...

47:34.800 --> 47:37.998
they are powerful and deep,
and yet there is little blood.

47:38.160 --> 47:40.755
But this was
a frenzied attack.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.599
Lashing here and there.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.479
No pattern at all,
just extreme violence.

47:45.640 --> 47:47.359
And during all this,
our victim,

47:47.440 --> 47:49.511
vigorous and anxious
and full of coffee...

47:49.720 --> 47:53.031
merely lies still and accepts
death without struggle...

47:53.200 --> 47:55.954
when he also has here...

47:56.120 --> 47:59.477
the means by which
he might defend himself.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.793
For you.

48:01.960 --> 48:04.520
Now, let us see here.

48:07.640 --> 48:10.792
Barbital. The Mickey slipped.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.316
Drugged him
so he couldn't use this.

48:14.680 --> 48:16.956
And later around here,
a lady's handkerchief.

48:17.160 --> 48:19.152
<i>An objet de luxe, handmade.</i>

48:19.280 --> 48:20.634
Boom, two hundred francs
in Paris.

48:20.800 --> 48:23.315
And she even has
an initial, "H."

48:23.480 --> 48:24.880
And our little friend,

48:25.000 --> 48:26.753
the pipe cleaner.
Another clue.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.600
Yes, a riot of clues
dropped most conveniently.

48:29.800 --> 48:34.431
Yet only one appears, however,
to be perhaps genuine.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.040
And maybe
this ashtray provides

48:36.160 --> 48:37.480
the accidental breadcrumb.

48:37.680 --> 48:39.672
A charred fragment of a note.

48:39.840 --> 48:42.992
An attempt, perhaps,
to burn evidence.

48:49.680 --> 48:50.636
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

48:53.520 --> 48:55.000
We may borrow
your equipment, yes?

48:55.160 --> 48:56.150
Thank you.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.480
<i>Merci, merci.</i>

48:59.640 --> 49:02.075
Now,
I prefer to understand...

49:02.240 --> 49:06.473
why a clue is left rather than
what the object is.

49:09.160 --> 49:11.231
We seek the truth from
within, not without.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.516
In this case, however,

49:12.640 --> 49:16.475
I may welcome a little
scientific assistance.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.196
You will adjust the flame.

49:26.040 --> 49:28.760
It's just another one
of those nasty letters.

49:29.560 --> 49:30.710
<i>You are mistaken, mon ami.</i>

49:30.880 --> 49:33.076
This one has a secret to tell.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.396
Look.

49:37.920 --> 49:42.233
"As a strong blood
is on hand, you will die."

49:42.400 --> 49:44.198
What does this mean?

49:46.600 --> 49:48.273
Come with me, Bouc.

49:48.880 --> 49:50.917
Let us fill in the gaps.

49:52.080 --> 49:54.720
This was never
a beachside puzzle.

49:56.720 --> 49:59.030
I know the dead man's
real name.

50:00.440 --> 50:04.912
It is not Ratchett,
but Cassetti.

50:05.080 --> 50:06.480
I know that name.

50:06.640 --> 50:09.075
Then you will also know
the name Armstrong.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.232
<i>The Armstrong case?</i>

50:11.440 --> 50:13.432
<i>The story
shocked the world.</i>

50:13.600 --> 50:14.590
<i>Two years ago...</i>

50:14.760 --> 50:16.911
<i>the renowned pilot,
Colonel John Armstrong...</i>

50:17.080 --> 50:18.480
<i>and his wife, Sonia,</i>

50:18.600 --> 50:21.115
<i>woke to find their
only child, little Daisy...</i>

50:21.280 --> 50:24.273
<i>taken from her crib
as she slept.</i>

50:25.560 --> 50:26.630
<i>Desperate...</i>

50:26.800 --> 50:28.598
<i>the Armstrongs
paid the ransom.</i>

50:28.760 --> 50:32.800
<i>But soon after,
Daisy was found murdered by...</i>

50:32.960 --> 50:36.590
<i>Ratchett,
who was Cassetti.</i>

50:37.920 --> 50:39.877
<i>Sonia Armstrong
was with child</i>

50:39.960 --> 50:41.633
<i>when she received the news.</i>

50:41.800 --> 50:44.793
<i>The shock sent her
into premature labor.</i>

50:44.960 --> 50:47.794
<i>Neither she
nor her baby survived.</i>

50:48.880 --> 50:50.439
<i>How do you know this,
Poirot?</i>

50:50.600 --> 50:52.956
Because John Armstrong
told me so himself.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.952
He wrote to me to ask me
for my help.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.112
By the time
I received his letter...

50:58.320 --> 51:00.152
it was too late.

51:01.920 --> 51:04.435
<i>He was found dead
of a gunshot wound.</i>

51:05.800 --> 51:07.439
<i>Self-inflicted.</i>

51:09.920 --> 51:12.992
"Daisy Armstrong's blood
is on your hands.

51:13.080 --> 51:15.151
"You will die for it."

51:15.320 --> 51:17.835
Indeed, you did.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.832
<i>Monsieur Poirot?
Yes, Michel.</i>

51:20.000 --> 51:21.673
Mrs. Hubbard wants
to speak to you.

51:21.760 --> 51:23.672
I held her as best as I could.

51:24.480 --> 51:27.120
Ah, Mrs. Hubbard,
I'm sorry to have kept you.

51:27.280 --> 51:29.272
You have a head full of steam
and a mouth full of words.

51:29.480 --> 51:31.711
You're goddamn right, I do.
What I have been trying...

51:31.880 --> 51:33.712
to tell you all day.

51:33.880 --> 51:37.556
The murderer was in
my compartment last night.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.310
I thought I'd be killed.
Turns out I might have been...

51:40.480 --> 51:43.234
only he got Ratchett instead.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.629
I woke up in the dark,
and I knew

51:44.720 --> 51:45.710
there was a man in my room.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.472
You are certain
it was a man?

51:49.080 --> 51:51.834
I know what it feels like
to have a man in my bedroom.

51:52.480 --> 51:55.314
I told your conductor,
and he wouldn't believe me.

51:55.480 --> 51:56.994
I said, "Check the
communication door

51:57.080 --> 51:58.230
"between my room
and Ratchett's.

51:58.400 --> 52:00.357
"He must have
left through there."

52:00.520 --> 52:03.240
Sure enough, it was unbolted.

52:03.800 --> 52:04.916
I know I locked it...

52:05.080 --> 52:07.037
after what Ratchett said.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.637
He made a rather
overt overture.

52:11.440 --> 52:12.760
Have you perhaps...

52:12.920 --> 52:15.560
heard of
the Armstrong kidnapping?

52:16.800 --> 52:18.359
You couldn't avoid it.

52:18.520 --> 52:19.795
Morbid stuff.

52:19.960 --> 52:22.031
The child's murderer,
Cassetti...

52:22.840 --> 52:24.672
died last night.

52:24.840 --> 52:27.230
Ratchett was the man.

52:28.160 --> 52:31.870
I told you, I knew he was
a rotten one.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.350
You do believe me...

52:34.520 --> 52:36.637
about the man in my room?

52:36.840 --> 52:38.877
I'm aware you think
I'm a silly woman.

52:39.040 --> 52:41.236
But I have proof it's true.

52:45.080 --> 52:46.116
It is
from the uniform...

52:46.280 --> 52:47.794
of an Orient Express
conductor...

52:47.960 --> 52:49.030
but it might have
fallen from Michel's

52:49.120 --> 52:50.349
when he was in your room.

52:51.600 --> 52:52.716
I'm not missing any.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.790
I found it

52:53.880 --> 52:54.950
at the foot of my bed,
on the cover...

52:55.120 --> 52:56.952
right where I slept.

52:57.120 --> 52:58.110
What do you call that?

52:58.320 --> 53:00.676
I call it evidence. Thank you
so much, Mrs. Hubbard.

53:06.360 --> 53:07.760
Have you ever
been to America?

53:07.920 --> 53:09.479
Once.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.393
Years ago, briefly.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.313
For what purpose?

53:13.480 --> 53:15.597
To confirm a suspicion.
Which was?

53:15.760 --> 53:17.160
That I wouldn't like it.

53:17.320 --> 53:18.993
I was offered
a post in Boston.

53:19.160 --> 53:20.833
Saw Boston,
went straight back to London.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.320
Is that where
Ratchett was from?

53:22.400 --> 53:23.720
Boston?
I can't says I know.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.235
It wouldn't be proper...

53:26.720 --> 53:28.040
to ask.

53:29.960 --> 53:30.950
Carry on.

53:31.120 --> 53:32.520
I last saw...

53:32.680 --> 53:35.912
Mr. Ratchett at nine o'clock.

53:36.080 --> 53:40.154
I brought his coffee
and hung up his clothes.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.070
You have a toothache, I think.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.071
I've got an extraction booked
in London this week.

53:50.240 --> 53:53.756
Mr. Ratchett insisted on not
putting it off any longer.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.115
He said
he was tired of hearing

53:55.200 --> 53:56.270
my suppressed groans.

53:56.440 --> 53:57.556
This sympathetic Ratchett...

53:57.720 --> 54:00.280
was it his usual practice
to drink coffee at night?

54:00.440 --> 54:04.719
Not at all. But he'd been
very agitated lately.

54:04.880 --> 54:08.794
Said he wanted to stay alert,
especially so last night.

54:08.960 --> 54:11.350
He found a letter
in his compartment.

54:12.560 --> 54:14.552
Please tell me
you didn't do this.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.154
If I were to leave
something unpleasant

54:16.240 --> 54:17.356
on your pillow, sir...

54:17.560 --> 54:19.153
it would not be a letter.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.594
Coffee.

54:24.280 --> 54:25.475
<i>Surely, such a...</i>

54:25.880 --> 54:28.679
proper and precise valet...

54:28.840 --> 54:30.752
would never speak
to his master as you did?

54:31.760 --> 54:36.277
Unless he knew his career
was coming to a sudden...

54:37.360 --> 54:38.760
end.

54:40.360 --> 54:43.000
No mere toothache, I think.

54:44.240 --> 54:45.310
The lungs?

54:48.160 --> 54:49.719
The thyroid.

54:50.440 --> 54:51.510
Spread now to stomach.

54:51.640 --> 54:54.280
Same as got my father,
five years younger.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.679
Months at best.

54:59.400 --> 55:01.392
"Inoperable, I'm afraid,"
said the doctor.

55:01.560 --> 55:04.553
And suddenly,
I wasn't... afraid.

55:05.400 --> 55:08.438
I would only do what
I wanted from here on.

55:08.600 --> 55:09.670
I speak my mind now.

55:11.200 --> 55:12.395
The coffee.

55:13.080 --> 55:15.037
It appears that his cup
was laced with barbital.

55:15.120 --> 55:16.156
You, of course,
will tell me

55:16.240 --> 55:17.230
that you did not
put it in there.

55:17.360 --> 55:18.350
Of course I didn't.

55:18.800 --> 55:19.995
When and from where

55:20.080 --> 55:21.958
did you procure
the coffee and the cups?

55:22.440 --> 55:23.760
In the kitchen, sir.

55:23.960 --> 55:28.159
I ordered it at dinner to be
ready at 9:00, and so it was.

55:28.320 --> 55:31.518
Anybody could have got
a hold of it before me.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.229
<i>Merci.</i>

55:39.200 --> 55:40.919
Mr. Masterman.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.357
I'm sorry about the toothache.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.275
<i>Merci.</i>

55:53.440 --> 55:55.432
I love the little cakes.

55:56.760 --> 55:59.195
So, Miss Pilar Estravados,
you are a missionary...

55:59.360 --> 56:00.350
but you trained as a nurse

56:00.440 --> 56:01.669
before you changed
professions, yes?

56:02.640 --> 56:04.040
I owed it to God.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.590
You owed Him a debt?

56:07.920 --> 56:09.513
There were...

56:11.240 --> 56:14.074
indulgent times in my life...

56:15.000 --> 56:18.596
when I took more than I gave.

56:18.760 --> 56:20.035
<i>Gerhard Hardman.</i>

56:20.200 --> 56:22.874
Professor of engineering.

56:23.040 --> 56:25.794
It is science
that will win back

56:25.880 --> 56:27.599
for Germany her pride.

56:27.760 --> 56:29.752
- Biniamino Marquez.
- Mr. Marquez.

56:29.920 --> 56:31.070
Listen, I wanna be clear

56:31.200 --> 56:32.475
of any association
with the crime...

56:32.640 --> 56:33.756
so please ask me anything.

56:33.920 --> 56:36.230
Anything. I never lie anymore.

56:36.400 --> 56:38.392
Did you leave your compartment
at all last night?

56:38.560 --> 56:41.712
Only once, to get an aspirin.

56:41.880 --> 56:44.440
Mrs. Hubbard offered me
something earlier.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.557
I declined at first,
but when I couldn't rest...

56:46.720 --> 56:48.393
I went to ask for it.

56:48.560 --> 56:50.791
My conference is in Turin.

56:50.960 --> 56:52.838
I am the only Austrian
to present,

56:52.920 --> 56:54.673
which means without me...

56:54.840 --> 56:56.911
the talks will
be substandard.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.355
Then I escaped prison,

56:58.440 --> 57:00.079
and I bribed myself
into the US...

57:00.240 --> 57:02.675
where I swore never
to lie or steal again.

57:02.840 --> 57:04.160
You see, my friends,
because when people

57:04.240 --> 57:05.640
trust you, they buy more.

57:05.800 --> 57:09.430
The Italians are cows.
The Spaniards, sheep.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.432
The Belgians...

57:13.040 --> 57:14.713
I come to my room,
which I share

57:14.800 --> 57:17.679
with the unhappy
English butler.

57:17.840 --> 57:20.196
A fish. He groans a lot.

57:20.360 --> 57:23.273
But I'm sure he saw me sleep
all night until morning.

57:23.960 --> 57:25.076
I should say...

57:25.240 --> 57:27.835
in case it is relevant...

57:28.000 --> 57:30.356
there was
an embarrassing moment.

57:30.520 --> 57:32.557
When I went to see
Mrs. Hubbard...

57:32.760 --> 57:34.592
first, I opened
the wrong door.

57:35.440 --> 57:37.079
Oh, sorry.

57:37.240 --> 57:38.390
<i>What time was this?</i>

57:38.600 --> 57:39.920
<i>That must have been about...</i>

57:40.080 --> 57:41.355
Don't be sorry.

57:42.320 --> 57:44.312
...twenty minutes to 11:00.

57:45.160 --> 57:47.152
This is interesting.

57:47.320 --> 57:48.470
As far as it is known,

57:48.560 --> 57:51.359
you are the last person
to see Ratchett alive.

57:53.560 --> 57:55.074
Your business?
Automobiles.

57:55.280 --> 57:56.634
I have three showrooms.

57:56.800 --> 57:59.918
I come to America
with nothing. And now...

58:00.000 --> 58:00.990
If what you say is true,

58:01.120 --> 58:02.110
Miss Debenham
will confirm it.

58:02.200 --> 58:04.112
But it is true.

58:04.280 --> 58:08.160
I would not lie.

58:08.320 --> 58:09.993
May it be possible
that Miss Debenham

58:10.080 --> 58:11.434
left your compartment
without you noticing?

58:12.040 --> 58:14.635
No. I sleep very lightly.

58:14.840 --> 58:17.833
The slightest sound
and I bolt upright.

58:19.720 --> 58:21.712
I was surprised once.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.278
Never again.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.358
No, I didn't say
I was a chauffeur.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.950
The photographs that
spilled out of your luggage...

58:30.120 --> 58:31.918
there was a beautiful one

58:32.000 --> 58:34.117
with a little boy
wearing a chauffeur's hat...

58:34.320 --> 58:35.674
visiting his papa at work.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.433
Who did you chauffeur?

58:38.680 --> 58:40.114
Miss Estravados,
why do your hands

58:40.200 --> 58:41.873
have the calluses
of a boxer?

58:42.080 --> 58:43.878
I do my work
in dangerous cities...

58:44.760 --> 58:46.956
where I cannot
be governed by fear.

58:47.520 --> 58:48.510
I trained to fight.

58:48.680 --> 58:50.273
But you do not trust
your god anymore...

58:50.440 --> 58:51.874
since your surprise?

58:52.040 --> 58:54.555
No, in case He is busy.

58:55.040 --> 58:56.793
God is always busy.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.920
<i>It's Masterman.</i>

58:59.080 --> 59:00.673
A man dying is a man
with nothing to lose.

59:00.840 --> 59:02.832
Bravo, Bouc. Except for
the problem of Mr. Marquez...

59:03.000 --> 59:03.990
who has now confirmed

59:04.080 --> 59:05.230
that his bunkmate,
Masterman...

59:05.400 --> 59:08.234
was reading in his bed
at the time of death.

59:08.440 --> 59:10.830
If it were easy, I would
not be famous. Next.

59:19.440 --> 59:20.430
<i>Miss Debenham...</i>

59:20.600 --> 59:22.239
you do not mind
to brace the air?

59:22.400 --> 59:23.959
For you, we have the picnic.

59:25.280 --> 59:27.715
While you made my roommate
suffer cramped quarters.

59:27.800 --> 59:28.870
I see.

59:29.080 --> 59:30.116
Choose the best location

59:30.200 --> 59:31.714
to extract the truth
from each suspect.

59:31.920 --> 59:33.832
Put her off-balance
and me, freeze.

59:34.240 --> 59:35.230
Clever.

59:35.400 --> 59:36.595
Will you write down
your full name

59:36.680 --> 59:38.353
and address, please?

59:38.520 --> 59:40.193
A pale mauve, by the way.

59:40.360 --> 59:41.680
Miss Estravados told me
you asked

59:41.760 --> 59:43.353
the color
of her dressing gown.

59:46.200 --> 59:47.554
<i>Merci.</i>

59:47.720 --> 59:50.030
"Mary Hermione Debenham."

59:50.560 --> 59:52.756
Do you ever go by Hermione?

59:52.920 --> 59:55.879
A constant Mary, when I'm not
employed as Miss Debenham.

59:55.960 --> 59:57.189
Left-handed.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.196
Unusual, I know.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.476
You mustn't have
your theory fixed

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.233
if you're testing
my handwriting.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.392
What did you think
of the dead man?

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.833
Uh, I can't say
I did think about him.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.749
I don't quite see
the point of your question.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.954
<i>Oh, forgive me, mademoiselle,
my little originalities.</i>

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.875
Human nature is perverse
in its complexity.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.875
To plumb it,
it takes the right tools.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.759
These are toys,
not tools, Hercule.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.350
I prefer you put them away.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.199
<i>The direct method? Parfait.</i>

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.591
You knew the doctor
before traveling?

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.750
Dr. Arbuthnot?

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.630
No.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.117
But such instant attraction?

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.920
We are not in America...

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.474
Miss Debenham.
There are no laws

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.836
against what you may feel.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.312
Nor are there laws
against silence, of which...

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.073
I hold my...

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.716
I've never been to America.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.799
Perhaps I may ask
about some...

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.155
words I overheard?

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.152
You and the stranger,
Arbuthnot,

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.311
are closer than strangers
might be.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.512
You said...

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.959
"Not now. When we are done.
Then no one can touch us."

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.759
What did you mean?

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.920
You think I meant murder?

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.879
To a man with a hammer,
every problem is a nail.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.719
You live crime.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.031
You see evil every day.
Not so.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.680
I see enough crime to know

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.673
that the criminal act
is the anomaly.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.839
I believe it takes
a fracture of the soul...

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.715
to murder another human being.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.079
I ask again,
what did you mean?

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.272
As we established...

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.314
there are no laws
against my silence.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.674
Very well.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.234
<i>And afterwards,
Princess Dragomiroff?</i>

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.790
After dinner, I came to bed.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.514
God blessed me with long life,

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.991
but cursed me with a bad back
to make it miserable.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.240
About a quarter to 1:00...

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.834
I called for
Fräulein Schmidt.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.434
Mmm-hmm.
She massaged me...

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.869
and read to me
for a while.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.792
- Then I sleep.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.549
Were you ever acquainted...

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.111
with a family
by the name of Armstrong?

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.957
They endured
an unspeakable tragedy.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.597
I was an admirer of
Sonia Armstrong's mother...

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.911
Linda Arden, the actress.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.113
A once-a-century talent.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.272
Miss Arden was to
turn to directing.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.673
She would have
become the first

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.110
woman titan of Broadway...

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.192
were it not for the tragedy.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.990
And this Linda Arden,
she is dead?

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.992
She might as well be.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.553
She no longer
leaves her home.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.680
Daisy was my goddaughter.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.712
She was a...

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.432
I don't see how this relates
to our troubles, Detective.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.196
The man killed last night,
his true name was Cassetti.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.432
The man who murdered
little Daisy Armstrong.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.353
I see.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.797
I admit I know this family,
and now this man is dead.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.756
The coincidence...

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.196
must seem unbearable.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.993
You may be permitted
a coincidence.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.912
<i>I must now ask a few questions
of your Fräulein Schmidt.</i>

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.309
No. There is no need.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.994
I can answer
to her character.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.157
Even still, if you will allow.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.678
Fraulein. Answer please in German.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.752
But her Excellency cannot comprehend me.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.194
That is the point.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.472
This is yours? H for Hildegarde?

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.432
It is too fine for me.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.237
This is the truth about last night?

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.718
As she said. She sent the conductor for me,

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.475
then I returned to bed.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.434
Did you see anyone when you returned?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.593
Only the other conductor.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.996
"The other conductor."

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.070
You mean Michel?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.400
No. A different
one than had awoken me.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.830
Please come with me.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.350
Are you sure
you did not see him?

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.556
I'm certain.
The other conductor

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.710
was a small man
with a short beard.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.950
<i>Fräulein, there is
no other conductor.</i>

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.110
I know what I saw.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.634
I remember because
his voice was high

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.870
and the uniform
was the same exactly.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.713
Though, I suspect,
missing one button.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.479
Sir, I need your
passkey immediately.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.429
We need to find a uniform
and a red kimono.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.040
Thousands
of photographs,

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.110
endless pairs of socks...

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.112
dressing gowns
in every color but red...

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.112
and still no contraband
conductor's uniform.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.715
Have we checked
all the passengers' luggage?

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.155
All except
for the Count

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.469
<i>and Countess Andrenyi,
monsieur.</i>

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.597
It is forbidden
to search their suitcases.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.558
They travel
under diplomatic visas.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.598
Where else could it be?

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.992
There is one last suitcase
we have not checked.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.270
My own.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.311
The killer
is mocking me.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.233
Good. His first mistake.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.438
And as the night
must follow the day...

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.637
<i>Pardon, mademoiselle.</i>

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.790
No, it's not mine.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.679
I told you of the conductor.
Why would I tell you

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:02.910
if it was me?
You would not...

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.117
which makes your compartment
the ideal choice to hide it.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.555
<i>Voilà, the button.</i>

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.360
And if a conductor's
uniform...

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.595
why not a conductor's passkey?

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.035
Now we know how the killer

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.589
magically passed through
locked doors.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.633
Bourbon.
MacQueen.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.790
Now what are we
looking for now?

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.149
500 pounds.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.470
MacQueen also had a ledger.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.914
All his dealings
with Ratchett.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.958
Where is it, hmm?

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.190
Poirot?

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.876
Bouc, keep everyone inside!

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.554
<i>Monsieur!
Please stop!</i>

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.230
<i>Monsieur!</i>

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.915
<i>Monsieur!</i>

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.394
Please stay
where you are.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.271
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.479
So, it was MacQueen?
You have your man?

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.154
<i>Pardonnez-moi, madame.</i>

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.232
How could he?

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.390
<i>I didn't kill him!</i>

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.630
<i>You tried to burn
Ratchett's accounts...</i>

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.069
but they are still
legible in places.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.150
The maths do not tally...

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.913
because you have been
stealing from him.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.560
It is full of the...

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.992
<i>- What is the English word?
- The chocolat?</i>

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.196
Fudge?
Fudge!

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.430
It is full of the fudge!

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.472
You stole from him!

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.199
You thought
you would be found out.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.511
That is why you killed him!

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.670
Yeah.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.277
Yeah, you're damn right
I stole from him.

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:20.715
Thousands.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.479
I knew his money
wasn't honest.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.872
What did it matter if I
skimmed some off the top?

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.993
But let me ask you a question.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.915
Why would I slaughter
my cash cow?

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.309
I didn't do it.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.913
- I didn't kill him!
- He didn't.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.069
He didn't.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.719
I expect his alibi
revolves around me,

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.950
drinking till
the early hours.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.109
Well, it's true.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:46.999
I saw him having whiskey,
and remarked

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.957
on the lesser quality
of American liquor.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.109
He offered me a tipple

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.714
to change my mind,
then another.

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:55.118
We got to arguing politics.
He had some...

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.519
tomfool opinions on Stalin

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.432
I had to correct. But
the man knows his spirits.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.471
<i>A word, please, monsieur.</i>

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.518
You can confirm you were
with him all night?

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.751
We smoked and spoke
till nearly 2:00, yes.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.718
Ah, such chums, him with
his cigarettes, and you...

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.270
Yes, you are the only man on
the train who smokes a pipe.

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:16.397
May I see your pipe
and your tobacco, please?

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.550
Of course.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.710
And you, Dr. Arbuthnot,

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.399
were traveling from India,
I believe. Yes?

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.392
You're interviewing me now?
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.676
Were you ever in
Ratchett's compartment

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.479
before he was killed?
Certainly not.

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.636
<i>But this is one of your
pipe cleaners, n'est-ce pas?</i>

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.395
If you found that in the dead
man's cabin, look elsewhere.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.795
I am a doctor, sir.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:35.240
I heal people.
I do not hurt them.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.078
About this, see,
you must have worked

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.594
very hard to
become a doctor.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.117
Not many of your race
are allowed the opportunity.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.192
Middlesex Medical College
permits one per class.

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:47.352
I had the honor in '24.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.274
I was a sniper in my tour.

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:53.033
A sharpshooter.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.634
Saved more than
a few officers.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.716
The more grateful,

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.280
recognized a fair mind
with a steady hand...

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.272
and supported my education.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.840
I take their generosity
as a debt.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.151
Did you know
a Colonel Armstrong?

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.279
Might have known
two or three Armstrongs.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.113
Tommy in the 60th...
Selby Armstrong...

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.634
No, I meant
Colonel John Armstrong.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.995
He had an American wife,

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.272
and his child was
kidnapped and killed.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.630
Oh.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.510
Never came across the fellow.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.797
When did you first meet
Miss Debenham?

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.792
We met when we shared
the railway convoy car

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.030
from Kirkuk to Nissibin.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.270
She claims otherwise,

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.477
and she has made herself
problematically suspicious.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.630
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.553
Mary is a lady.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.959
Leave her out of this. I
can vouch for her character.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.152
As you vouched
for MacQueen's time?

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.193
You won't listen to reason.
Never.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.673
You are lucky.
The good doctor insists

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.513
he did not let you
out of his sight.

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.234
See? There.
Couldn't have done it.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.470
Yes, you could.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.478
Ratchett took a sleeping
draught each evening.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.479
You could add barbital,
easily access that drug.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.558
Do the same with one
of the doctor's many drinks...

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.074
and the chance
to kill him is clear.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.230
Why would I do any of that?

01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.510
We have established
your motive.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.672
Perhaps I will
suggest a different one.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.232
A different reason,
a more personal reason.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.234
"A lawyer by education,
not by disposition."

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.393
Why did you pursue
the law, I wonder?

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.071
Was it to appease
a much loved,

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.476
but demanding father...

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.633
one who himself had made
a great success

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.074
in the same field...

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.234
and then lost his position?

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.478
There was a renowned
MacQueen, was there not?

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.230
The district attorney for
the state of New Jersey...

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.393
responsible
for the prosecution

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.671
of the Armstrong case.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.990
They didn't have a suspect.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.913
My dad was pressured
to go after

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.872
this poor French woman...

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.074
a maid with a weak alibi,
Susanne.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.071
He hung his
whole case on her.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.199
She killed herself.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.034
She was innocent.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.398
By the time the evidence
lead to Cassetti,

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.796
oh, he was long gone.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.754
They tore my old man apart.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.232
I couldn't do anything
for him.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:25.669
And yet you claim

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.752
that you did not know
Ratchett was Cassetti?

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.559
No, no.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.915
But you found him.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:31.996
No.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.070
You found him.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.230
You bled him dry...
No.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.676
in order to settle
your father's debts,

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.877
and then finally,
to settle the score.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.400
No, no, no.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.472
No. It wasn't...

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:45.519
It wasn't like that.
It's not the way...

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.036
Someone kicked in the door...

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.236
Doctor!

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.959
covered my face.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.638
All right, this needs
to come out now.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.278
I want my bag.
Of course.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.630
It's in my compartment.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.715
There will be no fingerprints.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.790
The killer was disposing
of the murder weapon.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.474
It's there!

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.119
The killer didn't hit
a lung or artery.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.714
She's lucky to be alive.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.274
You all are.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.430
Yeah, some genius!

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.069
Why haven't you
solved this case?

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.437
You must give the man
some time.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.795
Yeah, well...

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.839
I can't give that much more.
I don't have any blood left.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:37.990
Yeah.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.389
Accosting Mr. MacQueen,

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.994
and the real killer
is right here.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.992
One of you people.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.840
I don't know who you are.
I said nothing.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.434
Please, leave me alone.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.000
Play something.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.152
My friends, the tracks will be
cleared by morning.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.919
Please, return to your rooms.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.070
I'm sleeping here...

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.476
where everyone can see me
and I can see everyone.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.199
You should all do
the same. Conserve heat.

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.114
Remain in the open,
safely in view, until morning.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.839
A killer will never
hesitate to kill again.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.471
I will convey the same message
to the Andrenyis...

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.199
diplomatic immunity or not.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.600
If I may,
I will look at your passports.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.196
You know that
I must talk with her.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.039
By the way, there is a grease
spot on your wife's name.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.190
You might want
to look at that.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.880
Elena is not well.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.434
If you do not permit me,
your reluctance

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.676
will be noted
to the Yugoslav Police...

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.080
and I have no doubt that they
will arrest both you and...

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.196
How dare you!

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.680
Darling!

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.116
Darling.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.234
<i>You are funny-looking,
monsieur Poirot.</i>

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.756
Are all detectives
so funny-looking?

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.677
<i>I am sorry to wake you,
Madame la Comtesse.</i>

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.194
Hmm.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.237
I am always awake at night.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.278
In the day, I sleep.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:10.599
Some fear darkness,
but I cannot stand the light.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.717
You are always
under the influence of...

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.716
Barbital.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.476
Barbital, barbital.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.557
I take oceans of it.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.391
Oh, there's no use
in a lie, love.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.597
He can see right through us.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.950
I cannot go outside
without it.

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.276
I cannot sleep without it.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.952
I take it against my fears.

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.750
What are you afraid of?

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.509
Everything.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.917
Your passport has your
maiden name as Goldenberg.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.434
Jewish, yes?

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:03.160
Not so Jewish.
My middle name isn't Maria.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.993
And you are a dancer
like your husband?

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.112
No, not like my husband.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.317
Corps de ballet.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.596
He is touched by angels.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.638
I have been
shoved by passion

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.400
and hard work
to become adequate.

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.872
Excuse me,
I must lie down again.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.000
Is this your only
dressing gown?

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:31.834
No, I have another.
Corn-colored chiffon.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.640
I like speaking
to detectives.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.996
You never know what they're
going to ask you next.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.155
I'm particularly good
at capitals.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.238
My governess was a stickler
for geography.

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.879
Are you satisfied?

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.199
I am always satisfied
when I uncover a liar.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.990
<i>Madame, your name is
not Elena. It is Helena.</i>

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.230
Despite your clumsy attempts

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.511
to change it here
and on your luggage.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.356
My husband heard

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.994
of a piece of evidence
found...

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.753
a handkerchief embroidered
with an "H,"

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.190
and didn't want
my "H" involved.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.831
So we changed it.
The luggage and the passport.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.310
It's no crime to want to
be distant from trouble.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.193
Yet, here is trouble.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.629
A curious detail

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.189
about the Armstrong tragedy
at the heart of this case...

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.916
is how many people
were wounded by it.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.878
The younger sister.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.918
The actress mother...

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:29.352
stage name, Linda Arden.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.230
<i>I suppose she, too,
was of Jewish ancestry...</i>

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:36.916
as who is most likely
to take a stage name?

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.039
Is it too far to suggest...

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.193
her original name
was Goldenberg?

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.359
Especially when we find
a young woman,

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.920
the same age...

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.879
as her surviving daughter...

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.271
living in a world of fear?

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.078
The sister of
Sonia Armstrong.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.115
Get out!

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.236
I hear noises and I run.
Just in time, yes?

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.313
You must now believe the count
and countess are the killers.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:13.396
The count is protective.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.153
The countess would no sooner
kill a bedroom spider.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.476
And you may desist
with this charade.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.557
You are neither an Austrian,
nor a German, nor a professor.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.999
But a good imitation.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.271
Was it based on
someone you know?

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.554
A local butcher where
I grew up was a Kraut.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.554
Good man, great accent.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.475
What was it?

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.359
You said "Tur-in..."

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.352
the emphasis
on the wrong syllable

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.153
for a proud and proper Teuton.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.313
"Tu-reen."

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.918
You are one sharp knife,
I give you that.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.156
<i>Herr Professor
Gerhard Hardman...</i>

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.232
is my cover.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.835
I'm sorry about
the colored folks cracks.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.993
Hell, I'm half a Heeb myself.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.153
Cyrus Bethman Hardman.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.354
You are a Pinkerton detective?

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.432
30 years.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.512
I was in Stamboul,
coming back from a job,

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.636
when the office cabled.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.394
Ratchett asked for a man
to tail him,

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.670
offering triple time.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.832
Lucky me being nearby.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.437
He told me to look out

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.240
for a small, dark man
with a high voice.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.400
I watched that hall...

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.439
all night through
a crack in my door.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.716
Any thug...

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.236
had to go by me first.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.915
I'll take my oath on it.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.276
And would you
also take your oath...

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.040
on your thirty years
as a Pinkerton Detective...

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.759
or would you
lie to me again...

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:06.436
and deny that you were,
in fact, a policeman first?

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.037
Your gun, the checkered grip,
the blue finish...

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:13.278
produced for
the Police Positive edition.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.080
1927 issue.

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.754
It appears there are
no end to the lies

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.473
manufactured just for me.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.074
You can leave your gun
as you go, Professor.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.914
From the position
of his cabin...

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.998
it would have been
impossible to miss.

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.836
Unless Ratchett's
door was open...

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.954
as Pilar Estravados
claims she opened it.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:05.431
In which case,
someone could have been...

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.990
masked from his view.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.275
My darling Katherine.

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.635
This is an abominable crime...

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.952
<i>and I am stuck, ma Katherine.</i>

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.640
I cannot find
the crack in the wall.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.838
Why does one of them elude me?

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.558
I have always been...

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.159
so sure.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.233
Too sure.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.039
But now, I am very humble.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.629
And I say,
like a little child...

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.157
I do not know.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.835
<i>I am afraid, ma Katherine.</i>

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.880
My apologies,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.269
It is not safe on board

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.033
whilst the engine
is put back on the tracks.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.634
We are to wait in the tunnel.
Thank you.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.040
Where
are they taking the dogs?

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.395
They'll be happy.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.550
That's not right.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:29.120
Just to stretch
their legs, it's good.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.078
No, that's not right.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.550
It's freezing!

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.192
Are we stuck?

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.431
You asked for me?

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.756
Another interrogation?

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.355
Oh, no. I enjoy your company.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.835
<i>Merci, Bouc.</i>

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.116
Uh, please.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.355
I have a list of ten questions
I am no nearer to answering...

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.432
and the train
is about to leave.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.796
You have a clear mind...

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.715
and I thought that you might
produce an insight. Please.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.715
Hmm.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.352
"The handkerchief.
The pipe cleaner.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.196
"The scarlet kimono.
The uniform.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.556
"The time on the watch.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.555
"Was he murdered then?
Earlier or later?

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.150
"By one person or more?

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.039
"Which of them?"

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.799
Sorry, I can't help you.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.395
<i>Uh... Merci.</i>

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.480
Perhaps there is
an eleventh question

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.880
you don't know to ask yet...

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.236
that will give you
the answer to the rest.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.715
Perhaps.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.834
I could point an easy finger
at the, uh, Countess Andrenyi.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.435
I discovered she was
Sonia Armstrong's sister.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.954
Are you certain?
Yes.

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.799
I suspect she may
perhaps be innocent.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.354
Perhaps.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.920
But so many people
have lied to me

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.150
on this train
and do not seem to mind.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.674
You yourself did
so effortlessly.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.750
Me?

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.633
You told me you had
never been to America.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.035
You also concealed the fact

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.156
that at the time
of the tragedy...

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.357
you were living
in the Armstrong household...

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.920
as governess
to their daughter.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.070
And you know this.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.118
I have my living to get.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.158
A girl detained in
connection to a murder case...

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.913
no decent class family
would engage me.

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.800
Miss Debenham,
you planned Ratchett's murder.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.031
And then you sent for
the countess to witness it.

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.680
If she saw him dead,

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.274
the Helena you knew
might return.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.557
You waited for your roommate
to sleep, but she did not.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:20.710
You drugged her.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:21.995
But the barbital only
gave her a headache.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.475
She begged for an aspirin
when the train stopped,

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.119
when the conductor was
on the station...

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.270
when the coast
was clear at last...

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.396
when you were allowed to enter

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.675
Ratchett's compartment,
unseen.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.991
You loved Daisy Armstrong.
You killed Cassetti.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.673
Cassetti was a pig.

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.599
He deserved to die.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.033
She didn't kill him.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.879
I did.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.914
Mary, go.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.599
I can't let you
take the blame...

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.194
for what I did alone.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:10.393
Mary, please, go.

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.474
John Armstrong
was my best friend,

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.233
my commander.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.953
He believed in me.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:25.111
He sent me to medical school,
gave me a future.

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.630
Cassetti destroyed him.

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.991
In grief, I found Mary.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.637
Then I found Ratchett.

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.511
Our plan was to reveal him
to the police,

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.717
that's what you heard.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.315
But when I saw his face...

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.471
I knew he didn't
deserve a trial.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.197
So, you drugged MacQueen.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.431
You changed the time
on the watch...

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.559
so that you could lie
about the time of death.

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.155
I couldn't let Mary
be accused.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.595
Or MacQueen.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.477
My sins are mine
to pay for, alone.

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.799
I'm a soldier.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.519
A soldier kills to protect.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.914
And now, Mr. Poirot,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.480
I must protect myself
from you.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.714
Why aren't you dead yet?

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:36.518
Poirot?

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.798
Gentlemen, stop!

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.234
Sir, we need to get
all the passengers

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.800
back on the train.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.191
You will retire...

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.437
away from the train...

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.834
until I tell you to return.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.918
You tell your lies...

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.916
and you think
no one will know.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.149
But there are two people
who will know.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.438
Yes, two people.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.800
Your God...

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.356
and Hercule Poirot.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.358
It is time to solve this case.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.314
Dr. Arbuthnot asked me
why I was not yet dead.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.796
He knew, of course,
the answer.

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:20.040
A sharpshooter who does not
kill at close range?

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.998
Your shot was not a mistake.
It was a surgery.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.439
You could not kill me
because you are no killer.

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:32.036
None of you are killers.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.515
And yet, someone must be.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.835
There are two possible
solutions to this crime.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.874
One difficult,
because it fits with most

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.110
but not all of the facts...

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:47.033
and one more...

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.873
complex.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.832
The first solution.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.719
Ratchett had enemies.

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.839
A rogue Mafioso steals
onto the train at Vinkovci...

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.230
as MacQueen
and Arbuthnot take the air.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.754
Equipped with a uniform

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.433
and a passkey,
he stabs Ratchett.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.557
He leaves through
Mrs. Hubbard's compartment,

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.790
and makes his escape.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.070
No.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:10.639
No, no, no. It doesn't work.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.232
Why hide the uniform, hmm?

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.313
Who drugs Ratchett?

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.517
Or stabs Mrs. Hubbard?

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.633
Damn it, man!

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.440
So I ask,
who stands to benefit?

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:27.715
This crime is the murdering
of a murderer.

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.636
The benefit is, perhaps...

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:34.557
to the spirit,
an ease of suffering.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.950
To quiet a shouting voice

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.191
in the head
that prevents sleep.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:49.030
There is a murderer among us.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:51.470
So...

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.070
We have Dr. Arbuthnot,

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.590
a dedicated, grateful friend
to Colonel Armstrong.

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.314
He meets and finds solace

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.198
in the company of the
governess, Mary Debenham...

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:04.080
who is almost like a mother
to the little girl.

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:08.996
And so close to
Mrs. Armstrong's young sister,

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.072
Helena Goldenberg...

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.709
married to a powerful man

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:16.076
no stranger
to rage and violence.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:20.275
We travel also
with Daisy's godmother...

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.274
to whom belongs...

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.312
the monogrammed handkerchief

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.638
found at the scene
of the crime.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.838
The letter "H"
in the Russian alphabet,

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.480
of course, pronounced "N."

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.835
Natalia Dragomiroff.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.640
And her devoted maid
with a chef's eye?

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.234
Who was she before
her current employ?

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.471
Might I suggest
the Armstrongs' cook?

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.558
But we are not yet done.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.838
The nurse
in charge of Daisy...

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.593
her newfound religious zeal

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.319
born of guilt
at allowing her charge...

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.437
to be abducted.
It was you, was it not...

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.670
<i>in her room the night when</i>

01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.353
<i>Ratchett came in
through the window?</i>

01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.440
Did you have
a glass of wine too many

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:03.630
with your supper that night?

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:05.553
Have you blamed yourself
ever since...

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:07.279
for not being alert
to stop him?

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:10.200
She knew nothing
but kindness...

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.517
and love, until...

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.271
until I...

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.997
No need
to divine with me, sir.

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:25.076
I was Colonel Armstrong's
batman in the war.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.197
And afterwards,
his valet in New York.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:33.154
As fine a man
as God ever made.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.357
Would his chauffeur agree?

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.477
Was it a bank loan,
secured by Armstrong,

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.233
allows him to build
his automobile empire?

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.995
He's indebted for life.
Who else can we count?

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.719
What of
the Pinkerton detective,

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.995
once a police officer...

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.356
assigned to
the Armstrong case?

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.836
And he becomes attached
to someone,

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:52.799
for there is another,
uncelebrated victim.

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.633
You fell in love with the maid

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.791
before she was
falsely accused.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.474
<i>You quit the police
when you witnessed...</i>

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.677
<i>the travesty ofjustice...</i>

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.753
<i>when MacQueen's father
insisted on her arrest.</i>

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:06.276
When she took her own life.

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.557
No! No, no!

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:12.752
Susanne was so gentle.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.031
And she fell for me.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.758
Old and already getting grey.

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.797
I told her
she could do better...

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.593
but there she was...

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:27.431
on time for every date.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:29.910
Why else is a train...

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.357
so full in the dead of winter?
Why the inconsistent wounds?

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:36.638
Why the abundance
of evidence? Why...?

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:40.436
Why the conductor?

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.159
Pierre Michel of Avignon...

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.311
who lost his sister...

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.077
the accused maid...

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:53.110
Susanne Michel.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.118
Only one soul can
claim to have lost

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.112
more than any of you.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:05.159
The tragic Linda Arden...

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.391
mother of Sonia...

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.796
grandmother of Daisy.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:12.111
Retired from the stage...

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:16.191
but for one final performance.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.199
You're an awfully clever man.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.391
A murder should
have one victim.

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:49.598
When Ratchett kills
Daisy Armstrong...

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:54.880
a dozen lives are broken,
deformed, ended.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.680
They demand justice!

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.757
Of all these wounded souls,
we must finally answer...

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:04.913
who among them is a killer?

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.915
Who takes up the knife?
The answer is...

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:17.352
No single one of you
could have done it.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.519
Nor any pair.

01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:22.520
It can only have been done...

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.912
by all of you.

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.075
<i>Together.</i>

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.554
<i>Together.</i>

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.957
<i>Even when the avalanche
changes everything...</i>

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.875
<i>as does the detective,
plans must change.</i>

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.600
<i>The kimono, the uniform.</i>

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:42.989
<i>A remarkable improvisation,</i>

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:45.117
<i>the doctor who knows how to
wound without killing.</i>

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.277
<i>Each has their part to play.</i>

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.920
Do it.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.873
<i>It was my plan.</i>

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.157
I recruited them.

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.195
I had Hardman
track down Cassetti.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.999
I sent MacQueen
to work for him,

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.759
and then Masterman.

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.270
MacQueen could arrange

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.272
he travel on the day
that Michel was on duty.

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.110
Mr. Ratchett?

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:52.955
It's nothing.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.271
<i>Bien, monsieur.
Good night.</i>

01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.233
<i>And so it is done.</i>

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.715
<i>For the death of the innocent.</i>

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.717
<i>A life for a life.</i>

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.399
Revenge.

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.912
No one should
hang for this but me.

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:14.470
It was my plan!

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:18.679
Tell the police
it was me, alone.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.833
There's no life
left in me anymore.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.993
They have a chance now.

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.594
Helena, I pray...

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.432
has a chance.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.314
They can...

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.432
go live...

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.912
find some joy...

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.600
somewhere.

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.956
Let it end with me.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.237
They're not killers.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.110
They're good people.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.636
They can be good again.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:04.957
There was right,
there was wrong.

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.432
Now there is you.

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.636
I cannot judge this.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.678
You must decide.

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:19.270
You wish to go free

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.476
without punishment
for your crime...

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:25.030
then you must only
commit one more.

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.114
I will not stop you.

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:33.995
You can't let them kill you.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.950
You give my body
to the lake,

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.794
and you walk away innocent
at the station.

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:42.353
You must silence me.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.679
Bouc can lie.

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.993
I cannot.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.670
Do it! One of you!

01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.640
Don't.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.954
I already died with Daisy.

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.310
No!

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.359
You said your role
was to find justice.

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.910
What is justice here?

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:56.235
Sometimes, the law of man
is not enough.

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.237
Where does conscience lie?

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:05.559
Buried with Daisy.

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.911
<i>My dear
Colonel Armstrong.</i>

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:40.072
<i>Finally, I can answer
your letter...</i>

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:43.278
<i>at least with the thoughts
in my head</i>

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.790
<i>and the feeling in my heart...</i>

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:49.397
<i>that somewhere,
you can hear me.</i>

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.874
<i>I have now discovered</i>

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:54.520
<i>the truth of the case,
and it is...</i>

01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.320
<i>profoundly disturbing.</i>

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:01.836
<i>I have seen the fracture
of the human soul.</i>

01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:07.309
<i>So many broken lives,
so much pain and anger...</i>

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:11.440
<i>giving way to the poison
of deep grief...</i>

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:15.037
<i>until one crime became many.</i>

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:18.711
<i>I have always wanted
to believe</i>

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:22.510
<i>that man is rational
and civilized.</i>

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:26.117
<i>My very existence depends
upon this hope...</i>

01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:31.639
<i>upon order and method
and the little gray cells.</i>

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:35.952
<i>But now, perhaps,
I am asked...</i>

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:38.631
<i>to listen, instead...</i>

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:41.676
<i>to my heart.</i>

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:49.319
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:55.073
I have understood in this case
that the scales of justice...

01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:57.994
cannot always be
evenly weighed.

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.550
And I must learn, for once...

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:04.872
to live with the imbalance.

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.876
There are no killers here.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.397
Only people who deserve
a chance to heal.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:14.720
The police have accepted

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:16.240
my first solution
to the crime...

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:19.518
the lone assassin
who made his escape.

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:24.030
I will leave the train here
to conclude formalities.

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.152
You are all free to go.

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:31.354
And may you find
your peace with this.

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.519
May we all.

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.190
Hello.

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:55.435
I'm looking for
a Mr. Poirot.

01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.273
He's needed
on a very urgent matter.

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:00.398
Ah. He is on holiday.

01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.877
The, uh, Kassner case again?

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.509
No, sir, far worse.

01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:09.558
I have to take him
to Egypt straight away.

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:13.396
There's been a murder, sir,
right on the bloody Nile.

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:18.118
Are you the detective?

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:20.829
Yes.

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:25.196
I am the detective.

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:28.076
Could you please
straighten your tie?

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:33.195
I will see you at the car.

01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:31.474
Here you are, sir.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:33.950
<i>Merci.</i>

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:35.270
<i>Allons-y.</i>
