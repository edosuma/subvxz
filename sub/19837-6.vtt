<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

00:09.120 --> 00:12.480
<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.670 --> 00:18.530
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.140 --> 00:23.250
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.250 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.590
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.420 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:59.900 --> 02:01.760
<b>How wonderful...</b>

02:01.760 --> 02:05.020
<b>I really do love that look.</b>

02:05.520 --> 02:09.060
<b>But I was pretty excited, as well.</b>

02:10.390 --> 02:13.550
<b>I was so scared, I wanted to run away.</b>

02:13.550 --> 02:15.320
<b>But I couldn't.</b>

02:15.570 --> 02:18.040
<b>And at the same time, I was excited.</b>

02:18.040 --> 02:19.320
<b>Isn't that strange?</b>

02:19.320 --> 02:24.330
<b>A x Surprising x Challenge</b>

02:36.520 --> 02:38.340
<b>Looks like we made it in time.</b>

02:40.550 --> 02:41.970
<b>Leorio...</b>

02:48.710 --> 02:49.710
<b>Leorio!</b>

02:52.710 --> 02:54.490
<b>Man, that stings...</b>

02:54.490 --> 02:56.570
<b>Why am I all beat up?</b>

02:56.570 --> 02:57.660
<b>Huh?</b>

02:57.660 --> 03:00.590
<b>My memory is kinda hazy.</b>

03:01.030 --> 03:03.640
<b>We probably shouldn't tell 
him what happened.</b>

03:03.640 --> 03:04.700
<b>Yeah...</b>

03:05.270 --> 03:06.330
<b>Gon.</b>

03:06.660 --> 03:07.840
<b>Killua!</b>

03:07.840 --> 03:11.020
<b>I can't believe you actually got here...</b>

03:11.020 --> 03:12.830
<b>I thought you were done for.</b>

03:13.190 --> 03:16.260
<b>I just tracked Leorio's cologne.</b>

03:16.260 --> 03:17.320
<b>Cologne?</b>

03:17.320 --> 03:18.770
<b>That was how?</b>

03:18.770 --> 03:21.970
<b>You definitely are weird.</b>

03:22.440 --> 03:24.600
<b>Excellent work, everyone.</b>

03:24.600 --> 03:29.100
<b>Phase Two of the exam will occur here, 
in the Biska Forest Park.</b>

03:29.550 --> 03:31.710
<b>So, I shall take my leave.</b>

03:31.710 --> 03:34.360
<b>Best of luck to all of you.</b>

03:52.360 --> 03:56.700
<b>Will all applicants who passed 
the First Phase please enter?</b>

03:58.640 --> 03:59.900
<b>Welcome.</b>

03:59.900 --> 04:02.900
<b>I'm Menchi, the Second Phase examiner.</b>

04:03.590 --> 04:05.640
<b>And I'm Buhara, the other examiner.</b>

04:12.930 --> 04:15.900
<b>Wh-What was that sound?</b>

04:16.220 --> 04:18.500
<b>You must be hungry.</b>

04:18.500 --> 04:20.650
<b>I'm starving...</b>

04:20.940 --> 04:23.650
<b>There you have it. 
Phase Two will involve...</b>

04:28.080 --> 04:29.160
<b>...cooking!</b>

04:29.160 --> 04:31.280
<b>C-Cooking?</b>

04:31.280 --> 04:33.540
<b>Wait! Cooking?</b>

04:34.130 --> 04:36.900
<b>We're here to take the Hunter Exam!</b>

04:36.900 --> 04:37.930
<b>That's quite right.</b>

04:37.930 --> 04:42.710
<b>Your challenge for the Second Phase is to produce 
a dish that will satisfy our palate.</b>

04:42.710 --> 04:44.480
<b>Why do we have to cook?!</b>

04:45.120 --> 04:46.480
<b>That's because</b>

04:46.480 --> 04:49.560
<b>we are Gourmet Hunters.</b>

04:51.310 --> 04:52.190
<b>Huh?</b>

04:54.820 --> 04:57.140
<b>Man, what a letdown.</b>

04:57.140 --> 04:58.940
<b>They're Gourmet Hunters...</b>

05:03.270 --> 05:05.950
<b><i>The Gourmet Hunters Menchi and Buhara...</i></b>

05:06.820 --> 05:10.780
<b><i>Their selection as examiners 
could prove problematic.</i></b>

05:11.760 --> 05:14.140
<b><i>Only fifty applicants...</i></b>

05:14.140 --> 05:16.130
<b><i>No, depending on the task,</i></b>

05:16.130 --> 05:19.790
<b><i>it's possible that fewer than ten 
applicants will pass Phase Two.</i></b>

05:21.260 --> 05:26.800
<b>So, Gourmet Hunters, 
what are we supposed to make?</b>

05:28.530 --> 05:29.430
<b>Buhara.</b>

05:32.440 --> 05:35.180
<b>The required ingredient is pork.</b>

05:35.530 --> 05:36.540
<b>Pork?</b>

05:36.540 --> 05:38.590
<b>As in pig meat?</b>

05:38.590 --> 05:42.660
<b>You're free to use meat from any 
species of Biska Forest pigs.</b>

05:42.660 --> 05:47.450
<b>You must use the cooking facilities here 
to prepare the pork.</b>

05:47.710 --> 05:51.940
<b>And you only pass if we both 
find it delicious.</b>

05:51.940 --> 05:54.530
<b>And we will evaluate more 
than just the taste.</b>

05:54.530 --> 05:56.560
<b>Don't underestimate the 
intricacies of cooking.</b>

05:56.560 --> 05:57.580
<b>Got it?</b>

05:58.210 --> 06:00.790
<b>When we've both eaten our fill,</b>

06:00.790 --> 06:02.620
<b>the exam will end.</b>

06:02.620 --> 06:04.310
<b>We get it. We get it.</b>

06:04.310 --> 06:05.840
<b>Let's just start.</b>

06:06.460 --> 06:08.920
<b>Then, the exam's Second Phase</b>

06:10.110 --> 06:11.850
<b>begins now!</b>

06:18.480 --> 06:21.080
<b>Free to use meat from any species of pigs?</b>

06:21.080 --> 06:23.390
<b>You have a real nasty streak.</b>

06:23.390 --> 06:26.110
<b>Choosing the ingredients was my job.</b>

06:26.810 --> 06:30.860
<b>Only one species of pig lives in 
the Biska Forest, correct?</b>

06:32.240 --> 06:34.620
<b>I hope they don't get themselves killed.</b>

06:40.660 --> 06:42.580
<b>Hey, little piggy?</b>

06:43.620 --> 06:45.850
<b>Catch a pig and cook it.</b>

06:45.850 --> 06:48.010
<b>This is way easier than the First Phase.</b>

06:48.280 --> 06:50.220
<b>I hope it will be that simple...</b>

07:00.390 --> 07:02.240
<b>What was that about, Gon?!</b>

07:02.690 --> 07:03.340
<b>Found them.</b>

07:03.340 --> 07:04.260
<b>Huh?</b>

07:04.260 --> 07:05.280
<b>Pigs!</b>

07:09.670 --> 07:12.000
<b>Uh... They're chewing on bones.</b>

07:12.440 --> 07:13.320
<b>Don't tell me...</b>

07:13.710 --> 07:15.400
<b>They're carnivores?</b>

07:24.630 --> 07:25.880
<b>Huh?</b>

07:25.880 --> 07:26.840
<b>What's that?</b>

07:39.430 --> 07:40.850
<b>These pigs are crazy!</b>

07:41.420 --> 07:43.100
<b>The Great Stamp,</b>

07:44.060 --> 07:46.360
<b>the world's most ferocious pig.</b>

07:47.200 --> 07:51.010
<b>They use their large, stout noses 
to send their enemies flying.</b>

07:51.640 --> 07:56.240
<b>If you're too slow, you'll end up 
as their dinner.</b>

07:56.600 --> 07:58.660
<b>Take that!</b>

08:00.480 --> 08:01.080
<b>What?</b>

08:03.370 --> 08:04.120
<b>Huh?</b>

08:30.050 --> 08:31.280
<b>Just maybe...</b>

08:48.620 --> 08:51.270
<b>Could their foreheads be 
their weak points?</b>

08:51.270 --> 08:53.050
<b>So, the pigs evolved large,</b>

08:53.050 --> 08:57.300
<b>strong noses in order to protect 
their soft foreheads.</b>

09:16.160 --> 09:18.320
<b>Oh, my. They caught a lot.</b>

09:27.760 --> 09:31.050
<b><i>This year's applicants are very talented.</i></b>

09:32.900 --> 09:35.630
<b><i>However, the difficult part is yet to come.</i></b>

09:36.670 --> 09:39.640
<b>Now eat the pig and send me 
to the next phase.</b>

09:39.970 --> 09:42.890
<b>Okay, it's evaluation time.</b>

09:43.800 --> 09:45.640
<b>Taste testing.</b>

09:49.170 --> 09:50.650
<b>Tastes good!</b>

09:54.150 --> 09:55.920
<b>It's overcooked.</b>

09:55.920 --> 09:58.910
<b>The tough texture ruins the 
flavor of the meat.</b>

09:58.910 --> 10:01.570
<b>What? You haven't even tried it!</b>

10:01.570 --> 10:03.180
<b>It's plain as day.</b>

10:03.510 --> 10:04.540
<b>Damn it...</b>

10:06.700 --> 10:08.290
<b>Okay... Dive in!</b>

10:11.540 --> 10:13.170
<b>Huh? Why?</b>

10:13.590 --> 10:16.380
<b>Charred on the outside, 
uncooked inside.</b>

10:16.380 --> 10:17.930
<b>Your fire was too strong.</b>

10:26.150 --> 10:27.540
<b><i>Honestly...</i></b>

10:27.540 --> 10:31.900
<b><i>All they're doing is roasting the whole pig, 
like it's all they know how to do...</i></b>

10:31.900 --> 10:33.820
<b><i>None of them has made any effort!</i></b>

10:35.520 --> 10:38.450
<b>No one's passed yet...</b>

10:39.030 --> 10:42.450
<b>And Menchi hasn't even taken a bite...</b>

10:42.880 --> 10:44.210
<b>Hey!</b>

10:44.210 --> 10:47.960
<b>Can't anyone out there satisfy me?</b>

10:48.310 --> 10:49.350
<b>That's it!</b>

10:49.350 --> 10:51.410
<b>This phase of the exam is a cooking test,</b>

10:51.410 --> 10:54.920
<b>but they're judging us on originality 
and powers of observation.</b>

10:55.330 --> 10:57.380
<b>I see...</b>

10:58.940 --> 11:01.390
<b>How do you like my cooking?</b>

11:02.010 --> 11:03.800
<b>Is this supposed to be a kiddy meal?!</b>

11:07.080 --> 11:08.390
<b>I'm next!</b>

11:08.890 --> 11:11.060
<b>It's basically the same thing!</b>

11:13.520 --> 11:14.650
<b>I am next!</b>

11:15.320 --> 11:16.790
<b>Please judge my creation.</b>

11:18.360 --> 11:20.900
<b>Finally, something that 
resembles an actual dish...</b>

11:21.750 --> 11:24.410
<b><i>The point is to use the provided 
facilities and ingredients</i></b>

11:24.870 --> 11:28.060
<b><i>to highlight the main feature, the pork.</i></b>

11:28.660 --> 11:31.540
<b><i>In other words, the taste is insignificant!</i></b>

11:31.940 --> 11:33.440
<b>Yuck!</b>

11:34.940 --> 11:36.050
<b>Huh?</b>

11:36.340 --> 11:38.140
<b>Appearance is important,</b>

11:38.140 --> 11:39.980
<b>but only if it also tastes good.</b>

11:39.980 --> 11:42.770
<b>You're no better than #403!</b>

11:45.370 --> 11:46.880
<b>Too bad!</b>

11:46.880 --> 11:49.180
<b>No better than #403...</b>

11:51.540 --> 11:53.380
<b>That was so much food,</b>

11:53.380 --> 11:55.390
<b>I'm stuffed!</b>

11:55.740 --> 11:58.510
<b>Yeah, I'm stuffed, too.</b>

11:58.510 --> 12:00.820
<b>Therefore, no one passes.</b>

12:01.340 --> 12:03.210
<b>We're finished here!</b>

12:03.210 --> 12:04.280
<b>It's over?</b>

12:04.280 --> 12:05.400
<b>What the hell?</b>

12:05.400 --> 12:09.000
<b><i>As I expected, she's lapsed back 
into her old bad habits.</i></b>

12:12.360 --> 12:14.830
<b>What should we do, Chairman?</b>

12:15.570 --> 12:17.390
<b>I suppose I have no choice.</b>

12:19.080 --> 12:22.090
<b>Fine, I'll have to go in person.</b>

12:22.110 --> 12:32.180
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

12:28.180 --> 12:32.180
<b>Menchi</b>

12:32.680 --> 12:34.440
<b>Zero people passed?</b>

12:34.440 --> 12:35.930
<b>Are you serious?</b>

12:35.930 --> 12:37.960
<b>Does she really mean it?</b>

12:37.960 --> 12:40.440
<b>The exam is over?</b>

12:40.800 --> 12:42.480
<b>This isn't funny!</b>

12:44.440 --> 12:46.410
<b>I won't accept it...</b>

12:46.410 --> 12:48.950
<b>I absolutely refuse to accept this!</b>

12:49.200 --> 12:51.670
<b>In the end, you've still failed.</b>

12:51.670 --> 12:52.820
<b>Stop screwing around!</b>

12:53.310 --> 12:55.570
<b>You asked for pork,</b>

12:55.570 --> 12:56.730
<b>so we risked our lives to—</b>

12:56.730 --> 12:58.730
<b>I said to prepare the pork in a manner</b>

12:58.730 --> 13:00.890
<b>we both found delicious...</b>

13:00.890 --> 13:03.840
<b>None of you made anything 
remotely delicious.</b>

13:04.320 --> 13:07.090
<b>You all did almost the same thing.</b>

13:07.360 --> 13:09.350
<b>There was no effort made...</b>

13:09.350 --> 13:12.100
<b>Just when I thought someone actually tried, 
they only changed the appearance.</b>

13:12.510 --> 13:14.600
<b>No one attempted to emphasize the flavor.</b>

13:14.600 --> 13:17.350
<b>I'm positive that none of you 
took cooking seriously!</b>

13:18.020 --> 13:21.780
<b>Pork dishes are all the same...</b>

13:21.780 --> 13:23.930
<b>Just say that once more.</b>

13:23.930 --> 13:25.680
<b>Any more crap from you,</b>

13:25.680 --> 13:28.820
<b>and I'll shove my arm up your ass 
and knock your teeth out!</b>

13:29.230 --> 13:30.900
<b>Don't you mess with me!</b>

13:29.690 --> 13:32.160
<b><i>There's Menchi's bad habit again...</i></b>

13:30.900 --> 13:33.670
<b>I don't want any lip from a bunch of</b>

13:32.160 --> 13:35.610
<b><i>After all, only a handful of chefs</i></b>

13:33.670 --> 13:36.270
<b>amateurs who can't even roast a pig!</b>

13:35.610 --> 13:38.520
<b><i>in the entire world can satisfy Menchi.</i></b>

13:36.270 --> 13:38.150
<b>Hey! What did you just say?</b>

13:38.150 --> 13:39.670
<b>Why don't you repeat it to my face?!</b>

13:40.550 --> 13:42.460
<b>In other words, you people</b>

13:42.460 --> 13:46.680
<b>don't have the guts to try anything new.</b>

13:46.980 --> 13:48.120
<b>Shut up!</b>

13:48.120 --> 13:50.900
<b>I'm not trying to become 
a cook or a gourmet...</b>

13:50.900 --> 13:51.990
<b>I want to be a Hunter!</b>

13:51.990 --> 13:53.910
<b>Yeah! Yeah!</b>

13:53.910 --> 13:56.370
<b>My goal is to become a Black List Hunter.</b>

13:56.370 --> 14:00.050
<b>I refuse to let a mere Gourmet Hunter 
decide my fate!</b>

14:00.050 --> 14:02.060
<b>Too bad you got stuck with a mere</b>

14:02.060 --> 14:03.690
<b>Gourmet Hunter as an examiner...</b>

14:03.690 --> 14:05.840
<b>Better luck next year?</b>

14:07.050 --> 14:08.700
<b>Why, you...</b>

14:08.700 --> 14:10.530
<b>Don't mock me!</b>

14:15.530 --> 14:18.400
<b>Buhara, don't interfere.</b>

14:18.400 --> 14:19.780
<b>Well...</b>

14:19.780 --> 14:23.380
<b>If I hadn't intervened, 
you'd have killed him, right?</b>

14:24.300 --> 14:25.580
<b>Probably.</b>

14:26.980 --> 14:28.880
<b>Let me clarify this...</b>

14:28.880 --> 14:31.070
<b>We frequently venture into the dens</b>

14:31.070 --> 14:33.810
<b>of ferocious beasts, 
searching for ingredients.</b>

14:34.350 --> 14:38.720
<b>Every Hunter knows some form 
of martial art.</b>

14:38.720 --> 14:42.770
<b>You lack focus and the willingness 
to experiment.</b>

14:42.770 --> 14:46.440
<b>That alone disqualifies you 
from becoming Hunters!</b>

14:54.390 --> 14:55.950
<b>That said,</b>

14:56.350 --> 15:00.710
<b>it would be excessive to fail 
every single applicant.</b>

15:02.990 --> 15:05.800
<b>That's the symbol of the 
Hunters Association!</b>

15:05.800 --> 15:07.530
<b>Is it someone from the 
Selection Committee?</b>

15:29.600 --> 15:32.740
<b>Wh-Who's that geezer?</b>

15:33.070 --> 15:35.440
<b>The Chairman of the 
Selection Committee.</b>

15:35.440 --> 15:37.490
<b>He's in charge of the Hunter Exam...</b>

15:38.740 --> 15:40.640
<b>Chairman Netero.</b>

15:40.640 --> 15:44.410
<b>Well, I work behind the scenes.</b>

15:44.810 --> 15:48.790
<b>I only take action when there's 
an issue, like now.</b>

15:49.550 --> 15:50.760
<b>So, Menchi-kun...</b>

15:51.270 --> 15:52.010
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

15:52.650 --> 15:57.010
<b>You failed all of the applicants because</b>

15:57.010 --> 15:59.770
<b>you disapproved of their reluctance</b>

15:59.770 --> 16:02.440
<b>to try new things?</b>

16:03.130 --> 16:03.770
<b>No, sir...</b>

16:04.430 --> 16:07.730
<b>I lost my cool when one 
of the candidates</b>

16:07.730 --> 16:09.410
<b>insulted Gourmet Hunters.</b>

16:09.410 --> 16:12.780
<b>And I made the exam harder 
than necessary.</b>

16:13.370 --> 16:17.910
<b>In other words, you're aware that 
this exam was unacceptable.</b>

16:17.910 --> 16:19.070
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

16:19.070 --> 16:22.170
<b>When cooking is involved, 
I lose control.</b>

16:22.170 --> 16:24.270
<b>I'm unqualified to be an examiner.</b>

16:24.680 --> 16:26.840
<b>I will resign as examiner,</b>

16:26.840 --> 16:28.920
<b>so please redo the Second Phase!</b>

16:29.850 --> 16:32.400
<b>But it would be difficult to find</b>

16:32.400 --> 16:34.600
<b>another examiner on such short notice.</b>

16:34.600 --> 16:36.430
<b>I apologize...</b>

16:36.950 --> 16:39.310
<b>Very well. How about this?</b>

16:39.660 --> 16:41.930
<b>I'd like you to continue serving 
as an examiner.</b>

16:41.930 --> 16:44.160
<b>But you must also participate</b>

16:44.160 --> 16:47.820
<b>in the new test you propose.</b>

16:49.100 --> 16:52.190
<b>Is that acceptable?</b>

16:52.550 --> 16:53.620
<b>I'm certain that will help</b>

16:53.620 --> 16:56.700
<b>the applicants to accept the results.</b>

16:56.700 --> 16:58.310
<b>That's true...</b>

16:59.090 --> 17:01.640
<b>Then the new challenge will be</b>

17:01.640 --> 17:03.460
<b>boiled eggs!</b>

17:03.920 --> 17:05.290
<b>Boiled eggs?</b>

17:06.100 --> 17:08.850
<b>Chairman, can you take us 
to Mt. Split-in-Half</b>

17:08.850 --> 17:11.730
<b>in your airship?</b>

17:11.730 --> 17:13.420
<b>Mt. Split-in-Half?</b>

17:13.420 --> 17:15.000
<b>I see what you're doing.</b>

17:15.000 --> 17:16.180
<b>Certainly, I can.</b>

17:25.030 --> 17:26.430
<b>Now, everyone...</b>

17:26.430 --> 17:28.110
<b>Look down there.</b>

17:28.850 --> 17:31.230
<b>Wh-What is that?</b>

17:31.760 --> 17:33.380
<b>A Spider Eagle's web.</b>

17:33.380 --> 17:35.490
<b>They build webs down there?</b>

17:39.350 --> 17:41.490
<b>Look below the web.</b>

17:42.010 --> 17:43.250
<b>Those are...</b>

17:43.250 --> 17:45.380
<b>Those are Spider Eagle eggs.</b>

17:45.380 --> 17:49.040
<b>Spider Eagles build their webs in deep ravines,</b>

17:49.040 --> 17:52.590
<b>to protect their eggs from predators.</b>

17:52.590 --> 17:54.260
<b>This makes their eggs</b>

17:54.260 --> 17:58.260
<b>one of the most difficult 
ingredients to obtain.</b>

17:58.260 --> 18:02.100
<b>The eggs are also known as dream eggs.</b>

18:02.100 --> 18:03.860
<b>W-Wait a minute...</b>

18:03.860 --> 18:04.770
<b>You don't mean we...</b>

18:04.770 --> 18:06.350
<b>I sure do.</b>

18:06.350 --> 18:07.020
<b>What?</b>

18:21.580 --> 18:23.900
<b>Even if she can grab some eggs,</b>

18:23.900 --> 18:25.660
<b>how will she climb back up?</b>

18:39.900 --> 18:41.970
<b>Hey... She jumped down!</b>

18:42.320 --> 18:44.670
<b>Is she trying to kill herself?</b>

18:44.670 --> 18:46.220
<b>No, she's not.</b>

18:46.220 --> 18:46.730
<b>Huh?</b>

18:56.240 --> 18:57.890
<b>That looks fun...</b>

18:57.890 --> 19:01.800
<b>This ravine has updrafts</b>

19:01.800 --> 19:07.250
<b>that help the hatched chicks 
fly up to the web.</b>

19:07.720 --> 19:10.750
<b>There. Now I just need to boil the egg.</b>

19:10.750 --> 19:12.930
<b>Y-You must be joking.</b>

19:12.930 --> 19:16.790
<b>No reasonable person would 
jump down there...</b>

19:16.790 --> 19:18.610
<b>I've been waiting for this!</b>

19:23.740 --> 19:24.890
<b>Okay! Count me in!</b>

19:28.240 --> 19:29.020
<b>Wait!</b>

19:29.020 --> 19:31.480
<b>I haven't finished explaining everything!</b>

19:38.570 --> 19:39.610
<b>Catch you later.</b>

19:40.030 --> 19:41.250
<b>Let's go!</b>

19:41.250 --> 19:42.820
<b>Not yet.</b>

19:42.820 --> 19:43.890
<b>Why not?</b>

19:43.890 --> 19:44.990
<b>There's no wind.</b>

19:44.990 --> 19:47.910
<b>There isn't always an updraft.</b>

19:50.750 --> 19:53.310
<b>When's the next one?</b>

19:53.310 --> 19:54.260
<b>Wait.</b>

20:04.050 --> 20:04.800
<b>What?</b>

20:05.150 --> 20:07.890
<b>The web won't hold us all!</b>

20:08.100 --> 20:09.770
<b>Gon, not yet?</b>

20:12.770 --> 20:15.390
<b>Damn, I can't wait for an updraft!</b>

20:23.580 --> 20:24.660
<b>It's gonna snap!</b>

20:25.060 --> 20:26.160
<b>Now!</b>

20:50.040 --> 20:51.310
<b>And the rest of you?</b>

20:52.090 --> 20:54.130
<b>I guess you quit.</b>

20:54.130 --> 20:56.930
<b>It takes courage to concede, too.</b>

21:04.610 --> 21:06.280
<b>This is damned good.</b>

21:06.280 --> 21:09.520
<b>Much better than the eggs 
you buy in a store...</b>

21:13.760 --> 21:16.080
<b>I can see why they're 
called dream eggs.</b>

21:17.190 --> 21:18.730
<b>Hey, Todo-san.</b>

21:19.340 --> 21:21.590
<b>Would you like a bite?</b>

21:26.260 --> 21:27.510
<b>It's delicious...</b>

21:27.510 --> 21:29.970
<b>Now you've experienced the joy 
of discovering</b>

21:30.260 --> 21:32.730
<b>how good something can taste.</b>

21:33.420 --> 21:36.380
<b>We're risking our lives for that joy.</b>

21:37.910 --> 21:40.260
<b>I was completely outclassed this year.</b>

21:40.260 --> 21:42.610
<b>I'll be back next year!</b>

21:45.040 --> 21:47.280
<b>The applicants have learned that,</b>

21:47.280 --> 21:51.330
<b>whether you're a Black List Hunter 
or a Gourmet Hunter,</b>

21:51.330 --> 21:56.060
<b>calling yourself a Hunter requires an 
enormous amount of determination.</b>

21:57.480 --> 22:00.550
<b>Only 42 applicants remain.</b>

23:28.300 --> 23:30.850
<b>Next time: Showdown x On The x Airship!</b>

23:30.850 --> 23:33.260
<b>Use soap when you wash your hands!</b>

23:33.260 --> 23:34.420
<b>R-Right!</b>
