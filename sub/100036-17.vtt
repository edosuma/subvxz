And I really don't want to hear
what either of you has to say about it,

00:12.513 --> 00:15.182
Don't you ever wonder what it would've
been like if Dad hadn't died?

00:15.265 --> 00:18.477
No. I don't, Randall. Do you?

00:18.560 --> 00:20.896
Dad, if you go back in that house,
so help me God,

00:20.979 --> 00:23.565

Hey, uh, you guys need anything else?

01:24.042 --> 01:25.043
I can heat up

JACK: Just some minor burns.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.389
Hey, the doctor said I'm gonna be fine.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.141
He said the smoke inhalation was minimal.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.476
Yeah, thank God you didn't
go back in the house.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.146
Well, thank God that fireman
actually got to Louie.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.314

This family is the only thing
that matters.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.795
So, I just got off
the phone with the police.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.672
They have officially cleared the house.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.009

outside the hospital,

04:04.244 --> 04:07.789
and I followed him back
to his apartment.

But, sweetheart,
you have to understand,

04:10.250 --> 04:12.085
he was not well, okay?

04:12.169 --> 04:17.299
He was an addict, and I...
I got out of there

04:17.382 --> 04:19.092
and I never said anything to anyone.

That was Laurel.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.054

straight to your soul.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.683

when she was pregnant,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.852

07:18.355 --> 07:19.940

would see it besides me.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.654
temper your expectations
of this guy, just a little bit.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.822
What do you mean?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.450
He was a very nice man.

I think he might still be using.

-So I'm really not too comfortable

It was, but...

to spend more time together.

Oh, you didn't need to do that.
You don't...

10:21.747 --> 10:23.040
-It's just a little gift.
-You don't need to bring us a gift.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.291
Whoa! Hot sauce?

10:24.374 --> 10:26.418
-No, no, give that here.
-(LAUGHTER)

10:27.336 --> 10:30.088
Uh, my, my dad loved hot sauce, too.

10:30.172 --> 10:33.509
He always brought it with him
to every house we went as a gift.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.219
But it wasn't actually a gift,
he just wanted

10:35.302 --> 10:37.095
to make sure
he always had hot sauce. (LAUGHS)

10:37.721 --> 10:41.225
Randall told us that, um...
That he passed last year.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.060
We were very sorry to hear that.

10:43.393 --> 10:47.940
Yeah, I can't imagine going through
all of that stuff at your age, sweetheart.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.568
Yeah, we really shouldn't make her
talk about it right now, Mom.

10:52.236 --> 10:53.737
-I'm sorry.
-BETH: No, it...

10:53.820 --> 10:55.531
-No, no, no, no, it's... It's fine.

REBECCA: Sweetheart,
how do you like your salad?

11:02.746 --> 11:05.832
I added those little slivered almonds
in there just for you.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.043
Don't really like almonds.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.213
What? (CHUCKLES)

11:11.296 --> 11:12.297
Since when?

11:12.673 --> 11:13.799
Never have.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.554
Could you show me
where the bathroom is?

11:19.096 --> 11:21.098
-It's right through the kitchen.
-Can you show me?

11:23.392 --> 11:25.769
-It's good, Mom.
-JACK: I like the almonds.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.063
Was that a "rescue me" head nod

11:28.146 --> 11:30.107
or a "I want to go sneak in
a quick make-out" head nod?

11:30.190 --> 11:33.235
That was a "quit being
such a dick to your mom" head nod.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.113
You need to forgive her.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.573
Beth, you don't know
what you're talking about.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.825
-You don't know how I...
-Look, I carry bottles of hot sauce

11:39.908 --> 11:42.286
because they remind me
of my dead dad.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.665
And you get not one, but two,

cool dads, okay? (STUTTERS)

11:52.045 --> 11:53.422

he's decided he loves this pig...

She won best in show
at the county fair.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.518
It was a big deal when I was five.

So... So me, Kate and my mom
are outside the fence, terrified...

12:11.231 --> 12:12.816
We were screaming.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.610

KATE: (LAUGHING) Yes.

-You remember that?
-KATE: Yes, how can I forget?

12:30.792 --> 12:35.130

started squealing right back.

(LAUGHTER)

12:36.298 --> 12:39.134
And then Jack started squealing...

12:48.560 --> 12:53.106
I remember picking Randall up
from school one day in the sixth grade.

12:53.899 --> 12:57.319
And he was studying
the periodic table.

12:57.611 --> 13:01.073
He was so excited to tell me
about Marie Curie

13:01.156 --> 13:03.367
and her husband Pierre,

13:03.450 --> 13:07.287
who had discovered
radium and polonium

together.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.376

13:12.459 --> 13:14.336
And I... I remember him
saying to me,

13:14.419 --> 13:17.422
"Dad, I want to marry someone

13:17.506 --> 13:20.342
-I can discover elements with."

in its earliest stages.

I just had it.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.385
She misplaced her phone again.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.144
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Randall,

14:54.228 --> 14:57.272
but I suspect that
you and your father are about to

14:57.356 --> 14:59.608
band together to save your mother?

14:59.691 --> 15:01.527
So I'm just trying to keep track here.

15:02.945 --> 15:06.657
In the version of your life
where your father lives,

15:06.740 --> 15:11.119
you immediately find your birth father,
get him clean,

15:11.203 --> 15:12.746

15:12.829 --> 15:16.625
you have the same wife and kids,
cure stomach cancer,

15:16.708 --> 15:19.169
and you get your mother
into this clinical trial?

15:19.711 --> 15:21.839
Yeah, that's what I think
would've happened.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.299
Gotcha.

Hey, there's, um,

You're in that chair
for another half an hour.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.729
We could either play games
or you could be honest.

15:37.813 --> 15:38.981
Your choice.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.113
I don't understand.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.699
You asked for my version.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.493
Rose-colored or not,
that's what I gave you.

15:52.286 --> 15:54.872
Randall, when we started
working together,

15:54.955 --> 15:57.541
you asked me to challenge you.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.043
Now let's try this again.

16:00.127 --> 16:03.630
This time tell me
what scares you the most

about what could have happened
if your father survived that night.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.292
That you...

16:40.918 --> 16:43.170
Understand why I did it.

16:44.213 --> 16:46.798
You met our son's birth father

16:47.799 --> 16:50.427
and then you lied to me
about it for 17 years.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.846
What am I supposed
to understand about that?

16:54.097 --> 16:55.974
That I was trying to protect him.

16:56.725 --> 16:57.809
Protect him from what?

16:57.893 --> 17:00.521
(STUTTERS) William was sick.
He was an addict.

17:00.604 --> 17:03.649
I was... I was worried he would
want to take Randall away from us.

17:03.732 --> 17:07.903
Well, then we could have
dealt with that together as a family.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.906

I wanted to tell you so many times.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.626
-Then why didn't you, huh?
-Because I was scared.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.754

want to do what you thought was right.

of something this cruel.

-KEVIN: Mmm.

24:37.936 --> 24:40.355
I know. Oh, wait, did Kev tell you?

24:40.647 --> 24:42.441
-Tell me what?
-About going to the cabin

24:42.524 --> 24:43.734
for Fourth of July?

24:43.817 --> 24:45.360
-We're gonna have a big blowout.
-Ah...

24:45.444 --> 24:47.070
Ethan said he'd watch the girls,

24:47.154 --> 24:49.156
so, you know, I thought
we'd have a Big Three soiree?

24:49.239 --> 24:52.993
No, that sounds great.
Um, but with schedules and...

24:53.660 --> 24:55.078
I don't know,
let me think about it, yeah?

24:55.829 --> 24:56.997
All right.

-Okay.
-Just let him think about it.

25:00.417 --> 25:02.252
What's wrong with saying
I'll think about it?

25:02.336 --> 25:04.755
Nothing. Nothing.
You do it all the time.

25:04.838 --> 25:06.298
You think about it and then
you never show up. (CHUCKLES)

25:06.381 --> 25:07.674
-Mmm-hmm.
-I'm... I'm curious, like,

25:07.758 --> 25:08.884
why did you even bother coming today?

25:08.967 --> 25:10.844
-'Cause Dad asked me to. Yeah.
-Oh, Dad asked you to?

25:10.928 --> 25:11.929

-Hey, Mom.

25:28.195 --> 25:29.863
You know, I was just
about to leave, anyway.

I mean, what exactly
are we doing here?

29:11.877 --> 29:14.379
What is the point of this exercise?

29:14.463 --> 29:18.759
I need you to acknowledge that
even if your father had lived,

29:18.842 --> 29:21.011
that every moment
in your life after that

29:21.094 --> 29:22.513
could have gone a million different ways.

29:22.596 --> 29:23.764
I'm aware of that.

29:23.847 --> 29:27.100
You're aware that
you don't control the outcomes

29:27.184 --> 29:28.852
of every situation in your life?

29:29.186 --> 29:30.187
Yes.

29:31.230 --> 29:34.274
In your fantasy, you were the one

29:34.358 --> 29:37.277
who stopped your father
from going back in the house.

29:37.361 --> 29:40.155
Why are you so sure
you could've stopped him?

29:40.739 --> 29:43.242
Dad, if you go back in that house,
so help me God,

29:43.325 --> 29:45.827

and get you myself!

29:58.924 --> 30:00.384
It was his heart.

30:00.717 --> 30:02.302
I could've gone
to the hospital with him.

30:03.262 --> 30:04.888
I should've been there.

30:36.545 --> 30:38.172
Something's not right.

30:38.630 --> 30:42.593
You said he had
a widowmaker heart attack, right?

30:43.302 --> 30:44.428
That's right.

30:44.803 --> 30:46.722
So, even if you were there,

30:46.805 --> 30:48.765
you might not have been
able to save him.

30:48.849 --> 30:51.393
Unless you're gonna tell me that,
as a 17-year-old,

30:51.476 --> 30:54.062
you were trained
in emergency cardiac resuscitation.

30:54.146 --> 30:56.190
I don't know, damn it,
but I could've done something.

30:56.273 --> 30:58.609
That's what I do. I fix things.

30:58.692 --> 31:00.777
-You couldn't fix this.
-Yeah, well at least I could've spent

31:00.861 --> 31:02.905
the last 20 years knowing that I tried.

31:03.655 --> 31:04.781
(SNIFFLES)

31:05.908 --> 31:08.785
So... So you think
that would've made a difference

31:08.869 --> 31:11.455
in how you processed his death?

31:11.788 --> 31:13.540
Knowing that you tried to save him?

31:13.624 --> 31:14.917
Yes!

31:17.336 --> 31:18.795
Why do you think that?

31:21.048 --> 31:23.133
Because I tried with William.

31:24.343 --> 31:26.970
And when it became clear to me
that it was hurting

31:27.054 --> 31:30.724
more than it was helping,
I was okay letting him choose to stop.

31:31.183 --> 31:32.559
Because we had tried.

31:37.105 --> 31:38.273
Okay.

31:39.441 --> 31:40.526
What?

31:41.193 --> 31:43.403
-Nothing, I said okay.
-Mmm-mmm.

31:43.487 --> 31:46.782
No, you don't think it's the same, right?

31:46.865 --> 31:50.244
But you don't think it's the same
because I knew my dad my whole life

31:50.327 --> 31:53.497
and I knew William for less than a year,
so the bond was different.

31:53.580 --> 31:56.583
Obviously it was easier for me
to make peace with his death?

31:57.334 --> 31:58.585
Is that what you think?

31:58.669 --> 32:01.421
I... I think I lost two fathers.

32:02.756 --> 32:04.383
And I think, if I'd had it my way,

32:04.466 --> 32:06.844
obviously I wouldn't have lost
either one of them.

32:08.053 --> 32:10.055
So, to answer
your first question, yes,

32:10.138 --> 32:13.475
I'm fully aware that I'm just a...
Acute little pawn

32:13.559 --> 32:16.061
on the universe's big giant chess board.

32:16.144 --> 32:17.396
I don't need an exercise

32:17.479 --> 32:20.649
from some overpriced therapist
in cheap shoes to prove it to me.

32:24.528 --> 32:26.196
That was uncalled for.

32:26.864 --> 32:27.906
Sorry.

32:28.532 --> 32:30.868
Oh, please, I live for this stuff.

32:34.538 --> 32:36.540
It's interesting, Randall,

32:36.832 --> 32:41.253
how you see this entirely as
an exercise about losing your father.

32:41.503 --> 32:43.714
Your fathers. Plural fathers.

32:43.797 --> 32:45.215
I don't follow.

32:45.299 --> 32:50.470
Actually, this whole exercise began
because of a disagreement

32:50.554 --> 32:54.683
that you had with your brother
over your mother's care.

32:56.310 --> 32:57.853
If you think about it,

32:57.936 --> 33:02.941
your life has really been defined
by your mothers, hasn't it?

33:03.525 --> 33:08.155
The mother you lost at birth,
who is barely a footnote in your story,

33:08.238 --> 33:10.866
and the mother who lied to you
for 36 years.

33:10.949 --> 33:11.950
All right, look.

33:12.242 --> 33:15.370
William told me everything
he knew about my birth mother.

33:15.746 --> 33:19.082
It was a romance
that was sweet for a time,

33:19.166 --> 33:21.502
but it was short-lived and drug-addled.

33:22.252 --> 33:24.046
I'll never know much about her.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.174
I've accepted that long ago.

33:29.218 --> 33:31.303
As for my mother Rebecca?

33:33.722 --> 33:35.641
Yeah, she lied to me.

33:36.934 --> 33:38.435
But I forgave her for that.

33:38.810 --> 33:41.939
And we've moved on.
I've accepted that, too.

33:43.482 --> 33:44.483
Have you?

33:44.566 --> 33:47.361
Absolutely. It's behind us.

33:49.071 --> 33:50.072
It's...

33:50.864 --> 33:52.491
It's curious, though,

33:52.991 --> 33:57.329
that in both your scenarios
of how your life would've played out

33:57.412 --> 33:59.331
if your father had lived,

33:59.414 --> 34:04.127
the first thing that happens
after you save him, the first thing,

34:04.211 --> 34:07.297
is your mother tells the truth
about William.

34:14.471 --> 34:17.307
Why do you think
you're here in my office right now?

34:17.391 --> 34:20.727
I know. I know, because
everybody who comes to therapy

34:20.811 --> 34:22.938
has these deep-seated
mommy issues, right?

34:23.564 --> 34:26.149
I didn't say therapy. I said my office.

34:26.233 --> 34:27.317
My office.

34:29.194 --> 34:30.654
Do you know how many black men

34:30.737 --> 34:33.991
who can choose whatever therapist
they want, choose me?

34:34.658 --> 34:36.702
It's a very low number.

34:37.494 --> 34:39.329
You were highly recommended.

34:41.123 --> 34:45.294
Your mother and I are the same gender,
we're the same race,

34:45.377 --> 34:49.256
I'm probably around the same age she was
when your father died.

34:49.840 --> 34:54.219
Another therapist, a good one,
not an overpriced hack like me,

34:54.595 --> 34:57.931
might say you're looking
for someone like your mother

34:58.015 --> 35:00.225
to help you process her.

35:01.351 --> 35:02.603
What she's done.

35:03.270 --> 35:04.646
Her illness.

35:12.446 --> 35:16.325
I'm not a neurologist, Randall,
and I don't know your mother's condition.

35:16.992 --> 35:20.120
But I'm pretty sure you don't have
all the time in the world

35:20.204 --> 35:23.207
to heal from the wounds
that you have from her.

35:26.168 --> 35:27.586
So, what are you saying?

35:27.669 --> 35:31.757
(SNIFFLES) What is the exact advice
that you're giving me?

35:32.549 --> 35:35.636
I'm a therapist. I don't give advice.

35:35.719 --> 35:39.515
I offer observations and I pose questions.

35:40.349 --> 35:41.725
Observation.

35:42.601 --> 35:45.854
Even in the worst version of your life,

35:46.230 --> 35:50.817
you still protect your mother,
you still redeem her in the end.

35:52.653 --> 35:53.904
Question.

35:55.197 --> 35:58.283
Have you ever
really confronted your mother

35:58.367 --> 36:00.744
about what she did to you?

36:01.495 --> 36:03.413
About what she kept from you?

36:14.633 --> 36:15.676
Hey.

36:15.759 --> 36:19.263
It took six episodes,
but it finally makes sense.

36:20.180 --> 36:21.890
-And, baby...
-Huh?

36:21.974 --> 36:23.892
I might be leaving you for Yahya.

36:24.268 --> 36:27.729
Ah... I thought we was gonna
binge <i>Watchmen</i> together.

36:28.564 --> 36:29.773
You okay?

36:30.566 --> 36:31.984
You look exhausted.

36:33.694 --> 36:38.240
Turns out I'm still holding on
to some residual resentments

36:38.323 --> 36:40.534
about my mom keeping William from me.

36:41.034 --> 36:42.953
Well, hell, I could've told you that.

36:43.036 --> 36:45.497
-How much we paying this lady?
-Mmm-hmm.

-Okay? Do me proud.
-Okay.

I will definitely do better
than Toby's impressionistic spaceship.

38:03.825 --> 38:06.787
Yeah. I know. How are you?

38:06.954 --> 38:08.247
I'm good.

38:09.164 --> 38:12.835
I just, uh, have been thinking
a lot about your decision.

38:13.210 --> 38:15.629
Oh, Randall, come on, sweetheart,

38:15.712 --> 38:17.297
I thought we had put that to bed.

38:17.381 --> 38:18.549
I told you,

38:18.632 --> 38:20.801
<i>I have no interest</i>
<i>in being away from the family.</i>

38:20.884 --> 38:24.888
Okay? I... I respect the fact
that you're passionate about it,

38:24.972 --> 38:27.391
but I really don't want
to talk about the clinical trial anymore.

38:29.393 --> 38:30.727
RANDALL: <i>Dr. Leigh...</i>

38:31.562 --> 38:34.940
Everything you've said makes sense.

38:36.900 --> 38:39.403
And I've probably known
about it all for a while

38:39.486 --> 38:44.157
but haven't been able to...find it.

38:45.951 --> 38:48.537
I'm grateful to you for your help today.

38:49.246 --> 38:52.291
<i>Mom, I've been a good son.</i>

38:53.041 --> 38:58.046
And I never say stuff like that,
but I know that I have been.

38:59.339 --> 39:04.761
<i>After Dad died,</i>
<i>I stayed at home.</i><i>I took care of you.</i>

39:05.262 --> 39:07.973
I have been a good son.

39:09.391 --> 39:11.977
I know you have.
You've... You've always been.

39:13.395 --> 39:15.606
And I've let things go, Mom.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.649
(EXHALES)

39:17.733 --> 39:21.695
Things that were kept from me.

39:22.279 --> 39:25.866
Things that I should have
resented you for, but I never did,

39:25.949 --> 39:29.620
because I knew that
it would be painful for you.

39:30.370 --> 39:31.705
<i>So I didn't.</i>

39:33.790 --> 39:34.958
I know.

39:36.043 --> 39:37.920
RANDALL: <i>I lost my father...</i>

39:38.879 --> 39:40.714
And I couldn't stop it.

39:41.715 --> 39:45.928
I lost a second father,
and I couldn't fix that either.

39:46.637 --> 39:48.847
And now my mother is sick...

39:50.265 --> 39:51.892
And there are options.

39:51.975 --> 39:55.062
<i>I have never asked you</i>
<i>for anything, Mom.</i>

39:55.145 --> 39:59.233
Not in my entire life.
I've never asked you for anything.

40:00.067 --> 40:03.195
<i>But I'm gonna ask you</i>
<i>for something now.</i>

40:04.947 --> 40:08.450
Mom, you have to do this clinical trial.

40:09.785 --> 40:12.955
<i>And I know you don't want to,</i>
<i>but you have to.</i>

40:13.330 --> 40:16.166
(INHALES SHARPLY) 'Cause I don't
want to be in a therapy session

40:16.250 --> 40:19.336
20 years from now,
playing out scenarios,

40:19.419 --> 40:20.963
wishing that I had pushed harder,

40:21.046 --> 40:23.882
wishing that I had done more,
'cause, maybe if I had,

40:23.966 --> 40:25.676
you would still be alive.

40:27.636 --> 40:29.888
<i>I can't live with that,</i>

40:30.722 --> 40:32.349
even if you can.

40:33.559 --> 40:36.395
I will come to therapy
to work this through.

40:36.478 --> 40:38.605
I won't take it on alone.

40:40.357 --> 40:41.817
But I will not

40:42.693 --> 40:46.071
relitigate what my mother did
to me with William.

40:48.031 --> 40:50.242
I won't reopen that wound for her.

40:50.951 --> 40:54.037
I understand you think
that hashing it out

40:54.121 --> 40:56.456
will bring me some kind of peace.

40:56.540 --> 40:58.542
Maybe you're right. I... (SIGHS)

40:58.625 --> 41:00.085
I don't know.

41:02.462 --> 41:05.299
But I've already lost three parents.

41:07.217 --> 41:10.512
I know that losing my mother
would break me.

41:12.890 --> 41:14.391
I can't lose her.

41:15.225 --> 41:16.643
(EXHALES)

41:17.060 --> 41:21.148
I will do anything
to keep that from happening.

41:23.066 --> 41:25.485
I'll do whatever it takes.

41:26.069 --> 41:27.905
I've been a good son, Mom.

41:28.906 --> 41:32.284
<i>I've been a good son,</i>
<i>and I've never asked you</i><i>for anything.</i>

41:32.367 --> 41:36.205
But I am asking you for this now.

41:38.207 --> 41:39.917
And I need you to say it.

41:41.752 --> 41:44.254
<i>You are going to St. Louis.</i>

41:44.338 --> 41:47.174
<i>You are going to do this clinical trial.</i>

41:56.767 --> 41:58.143
(BREATH QUAVERING)

42:05.776 --> 42:06.777
(WHISPERS) Okay.

42:06.860 --> 42:08.195
(BREATH QUAVERING)

42:08.695 --> 42:11.823
I will go to St. Louis,
and I will do the trial.
