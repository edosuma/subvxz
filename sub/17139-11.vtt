WEBVTT

00:03.880 --> 00:04.961
Hex bag.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.641
Oh, gross. So we're thinking witch.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.130
SAM: <i>Uh, yeah.</i>
DEAN: <i>I hate witches.</i>

00:10.320 --> 00:12.721
<i>Always spewing
their bodily fluids everywhere.</i>

00:12.880 --> 00:15.724
And why does a rabbit always get
screwed in the deal? Poor little guy.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.609
Witches, they're murderers.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.001
Burn, witch, burn.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.606
Oh, my God!

00:24.200 --> 00:25.964
These are witch-killing bullets.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.481
Rowena?

00:35.720 --> 00:36.881
Told you you'd need me.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.201
Are we not a team?

00:38.440 --> 00:39.441
- No.
- No.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.680
You have to... No!

01:00.240 --> 01:01.366
Listen to me.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.289
Get out of there.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.491
Just go! Now!

01:28.680 --> 01:32.526
You people, you never learn, do you?

01:33.160 --> 01:34.730
<i>Always trying to run.</i>

02:19.040 --> 02:20.166
Hey, buddy.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.604
Wow.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.241
Oh, come on.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.971
And I was like, "Candy, the dogs... ".

02:40.200 --> 02:43.727
Hey, hey. Excuse me, do you mind if...

02:45.720 --> 02:47.210
Just don't buy a drink.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.968
I know, Stacey. So sad.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.681
Huh.

02:55.880 --> 03:00.329
Huh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Excuse me, look,
I'm not a... Not a bum, okay?

03:00.520 --> 03:02.807
Just somebody who really needs
to use a phone. Do you mind?

03:05.480 --> 03:06.561
<i>Great.</i>

03:07.440 --> 03:09.568
Thank you. Yes.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.606
Okay.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.520
- Hello?
- DEAN: <i>Sam?</i>

03:21.720 --> 03:23.006
Dude, where the hell have you been?

03:23.560 --> 03:24.925
I'm not really sure about that.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.647
<i>Well, where are you now?</i>

03:26.800 --> 03:28.404
Not really sure about that either.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.641
On...

03:32.920 --> 03:35.287
I'm starving.
How do you feel about waffles?

03:36.080 --> 03:38.082
- Uh, what?
- Dumb question, right?

03:38.280 --> 03:39.486
What psycho doesn't love waffles?

03:39.640 --> 03:41.642
I mean, they're fluffy,
got the little pockets full of syrup,

03:41.800 --> 03:43.609
<i>you just cover them
in whipped cream, am I right?</i>

03:43.800 --> 03:45.848
Anyway, meet me at Waldo's, okay?

03:58.840 --> 04:00.683
Oh, hey, did you bring any...

04:02.080 --> 04:03.081
Yes.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.129
- Sounded like you could use it.
- Oh, man.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.521
- Rough night?
- Rough morning.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.170
What happened? I mean,
you just went out to get some food.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.803
- I don't know.
- What does that mean?

04:15.840 --> 04:16.887
I guess I blacked out.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.690
And judging from this hangover,
it was epic.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.365
Well, I tried to call you.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.521
Oh.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.127
- Not sure how that happened.
- Great.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.405
All right, well, I'll text Mom,

04:31.560 --> 04:34.689
make sure she knows to get a hold of me
in case of emergency.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.286
And Cass, in case he tracks down Kelly.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.008
The mother of Lucifer's love child?

04:43.520 --> 04:47.366
Right, right, yes.
The devil-baby-mama-drama.

04:48.120 --> 04:51.249
Say that five times, fast.
Devil-baby-mama-drama.

04:52.160 --> 04:55.562
All right, Dean, you know,
uh, you've had a good run,

04:55.720 --> 04:57.961
but maybe let's pump the brakes
a little bit.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.406
I mean, you're not 20 anymore.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.085
Okay, one, the Rat Pack partied
till the day they died,

05:03.280 --> 05:05.248
and, B, I can still kick your ass.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.601
Mmm...

05:10.400 --> 05:12.084
Got a man who needs
some waffles down here!

05:12.240 --> 05:13.241
- Oh, no. I'm fine.
- Oh, my God.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.243
- You just take these at the moment.
- No. Dean, look,

05:15.400 --> 05:17.084
the morgue opens in, like, 10 minutes.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.081
The morgue?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.407
Autopsy results. Are you still drunk?

05:24.120 --> 05:25.121
I don't think so.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.805
All right, our case?

05:28.960 --> 05:30.883
The dead guy,
throat stuffed full of money...

05:31.040 --> 05:32.201
Right, yes, right.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.085
The accountant, Barry Gilman.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.241
- Right.
- Right.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.002
You think he got his ticket
punched by a demon.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.161
Maybe.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.806
Okay, but when we went over
to his place yesterday,

05:43.520 --> 05:45.443
we got a whole bunch of jack
and a little bit of squat.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.171
There was no hex bags, no EMF,
no sulfur, which means no case.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.731
But if it's not a case, then what is it?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.484
I don't know. Death by money?

05:51.760 --> 05:56.129
Maybe the guy got whacked by some
mob dude with an ironic sense of humor.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.449
All right, well,
I'm gonna go scope out the body.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.321
If you wanna spend some more
alone time with your waffles, have fun.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.766
Fine, hold up.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.001
- Did you pay?
- Oh, right.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.288
- Cash?
- I got it.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.641
Hi.

06:14.880 --> 06:15.881
Hi.

06:17.800 --> 06:18.881
And who are you?

06:25.960 --> 06:26.961
Yup.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.761
Epic night.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.801
Hey.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.366
Uh, thank you.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.644
Great. We'll let you know
if we need anything else. Thanks.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.606
All right.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.609
So, cause of death
was suffocation, officially.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.290
Okay, we already knew that.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.484
"See evidence bag B14." All right.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.008
Ugh.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.882
Huh, says they pulled all this
from his stomach.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.841
Big breakfast.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.445
Okay.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.681
All right.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.561
Well, well.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.080
You were saying about an ironic mobster?

07:32.400 --> 07:36.485
All right, so, witch force-feeds
ol' Barry here a hex bag,

07:36.680 --> 07:37.761
and then casts a spell.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.720
Yeah, a spell that pumps him
so full of cash, he dies choking on it.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.682
Ugh, witches. Well, I guess
it's true what they say.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.727
Mo money, mo problems. Right?

07:51.440 --> 07:53.090
I hope you're still drunk.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.404
Why would somebody want Barry dead?

07:55.560 --> 07:57.801
I mean, what,
did he screw up a tax return?

07:57.960 --> 08:00.008
He's actually more of a money manager.

08:00.360 --> 08:01.646
Well, whatever he was,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.207
looks like he certainly made
one hell of a...

08:04.440 --> 08:05.646
Uh...

08:06.400 --> 08:08.323
- Enemy?
- Enemy. Yeah, those guys.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.929
Maybe he blew the wrong person's savings.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.770
All right, well,
let's check out his clients.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.084
Which one? Barry worked
for the richest families in town.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.162
Wow, man, you were serious about epic.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.647
- It's the square one. Mmm.
- Yeah. I know.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.370
- Son of a bitch!
- What the...

08:42.799 --> 08:45.280
- Really?
- Sorry! Our fault.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.767
What the...

08:47.160 --> 08:48.924
R for reverse, Dean.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.570
Listen, man, I know we haven't
had it easy lately.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.366
This thing with the Devil's kid
and getting tossed into West GuantÃ¡namo

08:56.520 --> 08:58.682
makes me wanna crawl
into a bottle, too, sometimes.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.127
But, dude, you're wrecked,

09:01.360 --> 09:03.966
and we got a case to work,
so get it together, all right?

09:06.760 --> 09:07.761
Dean?

09:09.480 --> 09:10.481
Dean.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.406
Who's Dean?

09:23.120 --> 09:24.963
I told you, I'm fine.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.487
Dean, you forgot your own name.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.001
For a second. Okay, yeah, that was weird.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.924
All right, look, we know
we're dealing with a witch, right?

09:32.080 --> 09:33.320
Maybe you got hexed.

09:33.640 --> 09:38.441
Dude, if a witch got a clear shot at me,
I would be dead, okay?

09:38.640 --> 09:41.007
I wouldn't be freaking Dory.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.201
Dory?

09:42.360 --> 09:45.569
Not gonna apologize for loving that fish.
Not to you, not to anyone.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.810
Right, okay, all right.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.611
If you're doing so well,
name all the members of Bon Jovi.

09:51.760 --> 09:55.367
- Okay, we're talking circa 1983?
- Sure.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.841
Done. We got Bon Jovi.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.090
Whatever. This is stupid.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.050
Sam, I'm fine, okay? I feel great.
Look, uh...

10:08.640 --> 10:11.120
This is a gun. This is a coat.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.361
This is a...

10:14.320 --> 10:15.367
Light stick.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.841
A light...

10:18.160 --> 10:21.130
All right, we're gonna get you some help.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.888
Look, we can figure this out, okay?
Don't go calling Mom or Cass with this.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.129
Fine. But until you get better...

10:31.720 --> 10:35.042
Lamp. Right. So close.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.562
Shall we end the suspense?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.608
What's that, six in a row?

11:17.080 --> 11:18.809
Beginner's luck.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.601
Oh...

11:23.920 --> 11:25.649
Gentlemen, if you don't mind.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.609
Wee bit occupied at the moment.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.769
Yeah, well, we need your help, Rowena.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.286
<i>- Oh, really?</i>
- C'mon, man.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.364
- Rowena? I mean... Hey!
<i>- Yes, really.</i>

11:35.640 --> 11:37.369
Tiny vodkas. Score.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.648
<i>Am I saved to your contacts now?</i>

11:39.960 --> 11:42.486
Tell me, have I got my own ringtone?

11:42.680 --> 11:45.445
This is serious.
Look, I think Dean's been hexed, okay?

11:45.640 --> 11:47.290
He's been forgetting things.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.205
- Maybe he's just drunk. Oi!
- <i>He's not drunk.</i>

11:50.400 --> 11:51.401
We need ice.

11:51.680 --> 11:54.081
<i>Could be a memory spell,
but did his hair fall out?</i>

11:54.240 --> 11:56.129
- Body hair, too.
- What?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.920
From the neck down,
is he smooth like a Ken doll?

11:59.160 --> 12:01.606
I don't know, and I'm not checking either.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.330
Rules out a mnemonic curse.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.687
The obliviate spell
wipes the memory clean over time,

12:06.840 --> 12:08.251
but it's intricate magic.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.481
How do I break it?

12:09.640 --> 12:10.801
Theoretically?

12:11.840 --> 12:13.001
Kill the witch.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.161
Got it.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.009
All right, so... Dean? Dean?

12:20.880 --> 12:21.881
Dean?

12:30.800 --> 12:31.801
Dean?

12:37.880 --> 12:39.848
Dude, what are you doing?

12:41.080 --> 12:42.241
Getting ice. What are you doing?

12:42.520 --> 12:43.601
That's not our room.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.404
All these dumps look the same.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.850
So, this spell, I'm stuck in
some sort of Memento crap?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.724
Right. The fix sounds fairly simple.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.888
You just find the witch
who did it and kill it.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.087
Halle-freaking-lujah.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.366
I think you got hexed last night.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah. We need to retrace your steps.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.446
All right, think.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.370
What's the last thing
you remember you did?

13:09.360 --> 13:10.691
I got some ice.

13:14.360 --> 13:18.001
<i>Okay, from yesterday, the last thing
I kind of sort of remember</i>

13:18.160 --> 13:23.564
is us being here in big guy's office.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.401
- Barry Gilman.
- Uh... Yes.

13:25.560 --> 13:29.246
And we were here
and we were looking for leads.

13:31.480 --> 13:32.481
Douche tax.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.129
Yeah, you did that yesterday, too.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.964
All right, come here. Check these out.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.686
Do these shake anything loose,
these pictures?

13:55.880 --> 13:58.565
- No.
- Okay, think hard. What happened next?

13:58.720 --> 14:01.451
I went to hit the lore,
you went out for a burger, so...

14:02.080 --> 14:03.081
So...

14:04.440 --> 14:06.283
What do you want me to say? I ate them?

14:07.440 --> 14:09.522
Okay, okay, you know what?
It's not a big town.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.409
How many burger joints can there be?
Come on.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.403
All right, anything?

14:21.120 --> 14:24.647
Man, this is the third place
we've been to. No, it's...

14:25.840 --> 14:28.286
Wait. It's her. From the waffles.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.441
All right, come on.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.360
- Excuse me, hi.
- Hey.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.288
If you're gonna apologize,
you'd better make it quick.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.681
Me apologize? Uh, you smacked me.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.968
- You were being a dick. We're even.
- We're even for what?

14:40.160 --> 14:42.128
That's none of your... Who are you?

14:42.600 --> 14:46.047
Okay, look, whatever happened with us,
um, I'm sorry, okay?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.362
But, see, here's the deal, we're...

14:48.520 --> 14:51.330
We're FBI. Agents Moon and Entwistle.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.966
- FBI?
- Yeah.

14:53.160 --> 14:57.085
Last night, you told me your name
was Springsteen, like, The Boss.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.171
Uh, we, actually, sometimes,
we have to lie in order to...

15:01.000 --> 15:02.729
- Protect our cover.
- No way.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.846
Okay, listen, this is actually sensitive.
We think my partner may have been roofied.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.729
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

15:10.720 --> 15:13.291
If you can tell us anything
about what happened that night,

15:13.720 --> 15:15.006
it would be a big help.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.326
Sure.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.161
He ordered burgers to go.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.129
It was gonna be a minute, we were slammed,

15:23.280 --> 15:26.363
then you knocked back
four shots of tequila,

15:26.680 --> 15:30.969
put some "sick jams" on the juke
and then you hit the bull.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.447
- He what?
- I what?

15:32.600 --> 15:35.444
<i>Oh, yeah, you had the hots for Larry
as soon as you walked in.</i>

15:37.320 --> 15:39.368
He... You rode Larry?

15:42.680 --> 15:43.761
Was I good?

15:45.040 --> 15:47.407
You were amazing.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.521
Mmm.

15:52.520 --> 15:57.401
Anyway, we got to talking and, you know...

15:59.640 --> 16:00.971
We blew off some steam.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.361
Ah.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.608
Did you see him talk with anyone else?

16:05.760 --> 16:09.003
My bartender said she saw him run
out of here like his pants caught fire.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.324
We were supposed to meet up
after close-up,

16:11.480 --> 16:12.481
but you never showed.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.241
Poor thing, you were all roof-ed up.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.601
<i>I didn't...</i>

16:20.600 --> 16:25.049
I am so sorry if I took advantage of you.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.241
It's okay.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.169
Does this place have security cameras?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.001
Yeah.

16:37.760 --> 16:41.651
First action in I-don't-know-how-long.
It's like it never even happened. Figures.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.604
You see, now that's comedy.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.203
- DEAN: <i>Okay, there I am.</i>
- Yeah.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.646
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.081
What are you doing?

16:54.520 --> 16:55.851
I'm trying to read my lips.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.527
Now salsa you mittens?

17:01.200 --> 17:03.282
- You can't read lips.
- I can't read lips.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.605
<i>- You see that?</i>
- Yeah, of course.

17:06.760 --> 17:07.761
I think we got our witch.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.685
<i>Wait, you don't remember any of this?</i>

17:11.119 --> 17:12.929
It's like watching myself on Netflix.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.642
That guy look familiar to you?
That jacket?

17:31.600 --> 17:32.647
Never mind, stupid question.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.450
<i>I think Barry had a picture of him
in his office.</i>

17:34.600 --> 17:36.329
<i>Might be how
you recognized him last night.</i>

17:39.000 --> 17:40.161
Then I take a shot!

17:40.600 --> 17:41.965
<i>I know how to shoot a gun?</i>

17:48.200 --> 17:51.329
All right, so, you crash there.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.846
You ran that way.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.446
Oh, uh...

17:55.920 --> 17:57.160
You shot, uh...

17:59.440 --> 18:00.441
Here.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.841
Yep.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.726
Witch-killing bullet.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.528
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.521
There are witches?

18:18.360 --> 18:21.364
Dean, witches are real.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.287
Vampires, werewolves, witches,
they're all real.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.206
And we kill them.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.051
Awesome. That's awesome.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.689
Right. All right, come on.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.521
Oh...

18:45.400 --> 18:46.561
Okay, wait, so,

18:46.720 --> 18:50.884
Djinns don't grant wishes
and Sirens aren't all hot chicks?

18:51.040 --> 18:53.486
- Yeah, sorry to break it to you.
- Huh.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.604
- This is crazy.
- What?

18:56.200 --> 18:58.407
It was me giving you the talk.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.889
You know how many times we've had to
tell some civilian that monsters are real?

19:02.040 --> 19:04.930
Yeah, but monsters are real,
and we're the guys that kill them, man.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.168
I mean, come on, best job ever.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.449
Yeah, if you like greasy diner food,
crappy motel rooms,

19:10.600 --> 19:11.761
more than one Apocalypse.

19:11.960 --> 19:13.928
I don't know,
we kind of sound like heroes to me.

19:14.840 --> 19:15.841
Hey.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.126
Oh...

19:22.240 --> 19:25.767
And our best friend's an angel. What?

19:25.960 --> 19:28.611
- We just got to get you cured.
- Yeah, okay.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.521
Hey...

19:33.440 --> 19:34.441
DEAN: Whoa.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.123
Okay, now, these, freaky. Heh.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.970
They're just glyphs-

19:40.120 --> 19:41.121
Witches use them in spells,

19:41.320 --> 19:43.846
but I've actually never
seen any like this before.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.610
<i>Maybe Rowena will recognize them.</i>

19:45.760 --> 19:48.286
DEAN: <i>Yeah, maybe. Who's Rowena?
That's a weird name.</i>

19:57.680 --> 19:59.648
Sam. Sam!

20:02.120 --> 20:03.281
What?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.121
Is that a dead guy?

20:07.120 --> 20:09.327
Yeah, I think that's our witch.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.321
Cool.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.691
No, Dean, killing the witch
was supposed to be the cure,

20:15.840 --> 20:18.969
so if he's already dead,
then why aren't you...

20:19.800 --> 20:21.006
<i>Well, you?</i>

20:23.320 --> 20:24.321
Not cool.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.250
Okay, what now?

20:27.920 --> 20:28.921
Now we get out of here.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.610
- Let's go. Come on.
- Okay.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.481
Hunters.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.441
Poor Gideon.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.011
This is why he told us
to leave the accountant alone.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.686
That tub of guts stole from us.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.525
He deserved what he got.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.610
They're on us, Cat, we have to run.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.562
I am not going to run.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.643
And I don't care what Gideon said.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.407
So, what? You wanna kill them too?

21:18.520 --> 21:20.170
I want my family back.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.363
<i>- Is that a dead guy?</i>
- Yeah.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.041
Whoa-ho.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.089
Never seen a dead guy before.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.771
Uh, yeah, you have. Trust me.

21:35.680 --> 21:38.047
Hey, Dean, wait a second.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.441
Who are you?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.884
Spell's progressed, I see.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.441
I wanted intel, Rowena. Not a house call.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.648
I have a feeling you'll come to thank me.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.083
Your hair, it's all so bouncy.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.366
Why, thank you.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.245
Do we have to fix him?

22:03.400 --> 22:05.243
- Rowena.
- Samuel.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.681
Those glyphs you found
are an archaic form of Celtic.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.401
The Druids used it in their rituals,
calling it the Language of the Trees.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.523
Wait, wait, now the trees are talking?

22:19.440 --> 22:21.283
Uh, Dean, do you remember HBO?

22:21.960 --> 22:23.246
Um...

22:23.640 --> 22:26.120
- Cinemax?
- Skinemax.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.927
Great, all right, come here.
We're just gonna sit you down right here.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.481
Yeah, go ahead.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.001
Um...

22:34.440 --> 22:36.442
Is this, like, live Skinemax or...

22:39.240 --> 22:42.562
- Hey.
- Perfect. Stay there. Come here.

22:43.960 --> 22:47.442
There's only one family of witches
versed in this kind magic.

22:47.640 --> 22:51.486
I thought them all dead for years.
But when I saw those glyphs...

22:52.120 --> 22:53.326
Is this one of them?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.121
Gideon Loughlin.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.327
Did you know him?

22:58.560 --> 22:59.561
A bit.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.405
All right, tell me about this family.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.964
A hundred years ago, the Loughlins
came over from the Old World

23:06.120 --> 23:09.090
<i>and turned a small town
on the Mississippi Delta</i>

23:09.280 --> 23:11.328
<i>into their own personal fiefdom.</i>

23:11.680 --> 23:14.490
<i>Their children, Gideon, Boyd, and Catriona</i>

23:14.640 --> 23:17.530
<i>were like three rotten
little peas in a pod.</i>

23:18.640 --> 23:21.007
<i>The family possessed
a powerful spell book,</i>

23:21.400 --> 23:25.007
<i>a tome of Druidic magic
called the</i> Black Grimoire.

23:25.640 --> 23:30.043
<i>Witches came from around the world
to live with them and study its secrets.</i>

23:31.000 --> 23:32.161
<i>For a price.</i>

23:32.800 --> 23:34.040
So what happened to them?

23:35.760 --> 23:37.171
Hunters happened.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.441
Of course, I'd heard rumors
one or two survived,

23:41.600 --> 23:44.570
stealing away with their book,
but I dismissed them as gossip.

23:50.680 --> 23:54.162
With Gideon dead, if you want to
break the curse on your brother,

23:54.480 --> 23:56.084
we need to find that book.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.605
Wait a second. So you can't break it?

23:58.360 --> 23:59.691
Of course I could.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.286
But witchcraft this complex
would take time.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.930
More than Dean's got.

24:04.360 --> 24:08.365
He's already begun to forget himself,
everyone he's ever known, ever loved.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.006
Even you.

24:10.640 --> 24:15.248
Soon, he'll forget how to speak,
how to swallow, and then...

24:16.080 --> 24:18.321
Dean Winchester's going to die.

24:19.720 --> 24:20.801
Sucks for that guy.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.731
So after everything,

24:34.600 --> 24:36.409
that's it, this is what nails me?

24:36.560 --> 24:38.244
No, no, no, Dean.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.050
It's not gonna happen, all right?

24:41.200 --> 24:43.328
Well, you just told me
my whole life story.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.529
And I got to be honest, man,
I can feel it.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.965
Slipping out of my head.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.411
I mean, ganking monsters
is one thing, but this...

24:55.720 --> 24:58.041
Hey, you know, we're gonna, urn...

24:59.560 --> 25:02.769
We'll figure it out, all right? We will.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.400
How is he?

25:14.320 --> 25:15.924
- Like you care.
- Oh.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.490
You know, I've seen my brother die,

25:24.640 --> 25:29.282
but watching him become not him...

25:31.080 --> 25:32.809
This might actually be worse.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.407
Okay.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.564
My name is Dean Winchester.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.570
Sam is my brother.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.648
Mary Winchester is my mom.

25:54.720 --> 25:59.169
And Cast... Cass is my best friend.

26:01.480 --> 26:04.370
We need to find that Grimoire.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.401
Of course.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.048
Of course. That's your angle, isn't it?

26:14.360 --> 26:16.089
- Ooh.
- Oh, come on, Rowena.

26:16.440 --> 26:19.444
A powerful spell book shows up,
and all of a sudden you're here to help?

26:19.640 --> 26:21.642
Altruism isn't exactly your style.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.441
True.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.924
Also, it never hurts to have
a Winchester owe you one.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.848
My name is Dean... Winchester.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.330
My name is...

26:58.960 --> 27:00.450
My name is... is...

27:08.480 --> 27:11.006
Gideon Loughlin's address
was in his accountant's file.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.571
If the book is there, I'll find it.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.165
Of course, you'll need me there to help...

27:14.360 --> 27:16.522
No, no, you're staying here with Dean.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.722
I most certainly am not.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.087
Well, he can't come with me
and I'm not leaving him alone.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.044
And I obviously don't trust you.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.726
Obviously.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.166
The <i>Black Grimoire's</i>
written in ancient Druid.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.607
How do you propose to find
the proper spell without me there...

27:30.760 --> 27:33.764
Well, you said a few of the Loughlins
survived, right? That was the rumor?

27:34.000 --> 27:37.288
So you expect one of them to what,

27:37.440 --> 27:41.240
translate their ancient,
super-secret family spell book for you?

27:41.400 --> 27:45.405
You just killed their brother.
They'd sooner use your skin as an outfit.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.411
They can try.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.280
My...

28:05.320 --> 28:06.560
I don't know.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.090
- Stop touching everything.
- Sorry.

28:24.880 --> 28:25.881
Here,

28:28.640 --> 28:29.801
play with this,

28:30.520 --> 28:33.524
- and I'll tell you a story.
- Okay.

28:36.120 --> 28:40.967
Once, a beautiful witch was, again,

28:41.120 --> 28:46.809
run out of her homeland by those pompous,
self-righteous, murderous hooligans.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.885
You know them as
the British Men of Letters.

28:50.280 --> 28:51.281
Mmm.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.046
She sought refuge
with a family of witches.

28:54.320 --> 28:58.769
All she wanted was a roof over her head
and a safe place to hone her magic.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.926
Yet, they threw her out like...

29:03.200 --> 29:06.010
Like common trash.
Said she wasn't up to snuff.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.450
Oh, these witches sound like dicks.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.130
I think you got plenty of snuff.

29:15.320 --> 29:18.688
You can really remember nothing, can you?

29:19.520 --> 29:22.649
What a gift not to recall
the things you've done.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.481
What have I done?

29:27.960 --> 29:31.248
Oh, you're a killer, Dean Winchester.

29:40.840 --> 29:41.966
Who's inside?

29:45.400 --> 29:47.482
Wait, I killed people?

29:48.560 --> 29:49.721
ROWENA: <i>Scores.</i>

29:50.920 --> 29:55.323
But though you may be a stubborn
pain in the arse

29:55.520 --> 29:58.763
with the manners of a Neanderthal
and the dining habits of a toddler,

29:58.920 --> 30:01.082
everything you've done, you've done...

30:04.680 --> 30:06.728
For the greater good.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.885
Oh, and that's supposed to make it okay?

30:09.800 --> 30:11.245
I wouldn't know.

30:11.720 --> 30:15.770
You helped those other than yourself.
But me?

30:19.480 --> 30:21.289
I've done horrible things.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.929
And I told myself it was fine.

30:24.160 --> 30:27.130
It was the price of power,
and power's what matters, right?

30:28.240 --> 30:29.651
Then I met God and his sister,

30:29.800 --> 30:32.406
the two most powerful
beings in the universe,

30:32.600 --> 30:34.762
wasting it on squabbling
with each other...

30:35.280 --> 30:37.931
I thought, if they can't be happy,

30:38.240 --> 30:40.083
or at least satisfied,

30:42.040 --> 30:44.168
how can there be any hope for me?

30:47.760 --> 30:48.841
Why are you telling me this?

30:53.440 --> 30:55.602
Because I know you won't remember.

31:03.720 --> 31:04.721
You're in?

31:05.160 --> 31:06.969
Shh... Yeah, I'm in.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.962
All right, as soon as
I get the translation,

31:11.320 --> 31:12.651
<i>you cast the spell.</i>

31:36.160 --> 31:38.242
This gun is full of witch-killing bullets.

31:39.560 --> 31:43.246
<i>So why don't you go to your</i> Grimoire
<i>and tell me how to break the memory spell.</i>

31:44.040 --> 31:45.610
I told him you'd come.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.801
Boyd wanted to go after you,
but I said, "Why bother?"

31:51.520 --> 31:54.842
You're hunters, you'll hunt us down.

31:55.720 --> 32:01.204
Right at our doorstep,
hot and fresh like pizza.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.005
I'm not asking you again.

32:33.360 --> 32:34.361
Sam?

32:58.520 --> 33:00.966
"Your brother's been kidnapped by a witch."

33:01.680 --> 33:04.126
"Found your stupid car and left you here."

33:04.800 --> 33:06.006
Stupid?

33:06.640 --> 33:07.926
Okay.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.730
"Stay."

33:17.560 --> 33:20.040
Boyd, you promised.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.322
Without Gideon, we are not a family.

33:22.520 --> 33:24.761
Well, you should have thought of that
before you went behind his back

33:24.920 --> 33:26.604
and piÃ±ata-ed the accountant.

33:26.760 --> 33:27.921
Gideon told you to let it go.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.643
And let us be cheated by some sniveling,
weak human nothing?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.365
You got our brother killed.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.046
Mmm.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.284
But we can bring him back.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.001
Do it.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.961
Please.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.401
For me?

34:10.679 --> 34:12.250
Catriona Loughlin.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.688
The years have not been kind.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.121
Who are you?

34:16.639 --> 34:17.801
Rowena.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.649
Rowena MacLeod?

34:27.840 --> 34:29.170
You don't wanna do this.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.289
Well, well, well.

34:32.639 --> 34:34.130
Look who's awake.

34:34.320 --> 34:37.051
So, whatever your sister has planned,

34:38.120 --> 34:39.326
you don't have to do it.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.731
You mean, swapping your soul for his?

34:46.320 --> 34:47.367
I'm afraid I do.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.760
Raggedy Ann.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.201
Excuse me?

34:56.719 --> 34:58.210
I remember you.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.721
A rag doll all huddled up on our doorstep.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.365
I swore I could see
the fleas nibbling away

35:06.520 --> 35:11.560
at whatever the hell was left
of that dirty little body of yours.

35:12.880 --> 35:17.807
And still, still you thought
you were worthy of our magic.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.047
And when we disagreed,

35:22.960 --> 35:26.567
oh, how you begged.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.523
How you threw yourself down and...

35:32.600 --> 35:35.922
Offered yourself to each of us.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.322
Boyd almost took you up on it, too,

35:39.960 --> 35:44.409
but then I told him
it would be cleaner with the pigs.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.090
- You know what they say.
- Mmm.

35:47.760 --> 35:51.606
Nothing heals old wounds
like opening fresh ones.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.001
Hmm.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.001
Whoa!

36:30.320 --> 36:34.803
âª <i>I'm just a little girl
I'm Raggedy Ann</i> âª

36:35.240 --> 36:38.289
âª <i>Raggedy Ann</i> âª

36:39.440 --> 36:46.403
âª <i>Falling apart at the seams</i> âª

36:54.800 --> 36:56.768
I've never been very good at darts.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.361
Do over.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.804
âª <i>Just a little girl
I'm Raggedy Ann</i> âª

37:01.960 --> 37:05.043
âª <i>Raggedy Ann</i> âª

37:11.320 --> 37:12.367
A gun?

37:12.880 --> 37:15.087
You really think that's gonna work on...

37:43.880 --> 37:46.724
No, no, no. Brother. Witch.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.247
No.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.371
Hey, what, is that it? Is it done?

38:15.600 --> 38:16.647
Who's this hippie?

38:26.960 --> 38:28.246
Look at his face.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.891
Kind of like that time when I ate
all your Halloween candy. Remember that?

38:33.080 --> 38:34.081
Classic.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.601
Not funny.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.642
I can't believe you called Rowena.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.968
- I can't believe you rode Larry.
- Hey.

38:47.120 --> 38:50.090
I was awesome on that bull.
I was like a god.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.766
Now, should you experience
any odd memories

38:52.920 --> 38:55.924
from when you were hexed, conversations,

38:56.240 --> 38:57.241
you let me know?

38:58.640 --> 39:00.722
It's blank mostly. Really.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.366
Oh, just a second.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.887
If you want to thank me,
you can send me a wee gift basket.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.041
The book.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.766
You're no fun.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.963
We owe you one. A small one.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.806
So how are you holding up?
After the spell?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.611
That thing kicked my ass.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.971
You know, I got to be honest,

39:34.280 --> 39:37.045
I was actually a little jealous at first.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.129
Of what? The curse that nearly killed me?

39:39.400 --> 39:43.962
No, just, you know,
some of the things we've done.

39:44.120 --> 39:48.921
We've had this weight for forever.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.363
And seeing it gone, you looked happy.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.642
Huh, well, look,
was it nice to drop our baggage?

39:59.160 --> 40:01.208
Yeah, maybe. Hell, probably.

40:02.680 --> 40:06.002
But it wasn't just the crap that got lost,
I mean, it was everything.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.846
It was us, it was what we do.
You know, all of it.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.564
So if that's what being happy looks like,

40:15.920 --> 40:17.285
I think I'll pass.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.441
- It's the, uh, shiny one...
- Get in the car.
