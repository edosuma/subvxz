WEBVTT

00:01.245 --> 00:02.280
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:02.520 --> 00:04.040
Am I interrupting something important?

00:04.041 --> 00:06.939
Impossible.
I work for the government.

00:06.942 --> 00:08.942
I just picked up the girls,
thought we'd stop by.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.427
How are the girls...

00:11.429 --> 00:12.529
Yes, they are.

00:12.531 --> 00:14.030
Hello, girls.

00:14.032 --> 00:16.733
Diane and I have been seeing
a lot of each other, recently.

00:16.735 --> 00:19.602
She is a sharp, confident, strong woman.

00:19.835 --> 00:21.402
Her children are loud.

00:23.435 --> 00:25.402
Kung fu!

00:25.403 --> 00:26.870
Here comes trouble!

00:31.076 --> 00:32.542
This is fun.

00:32.543 --> 00:33.626
Easy, girls.

00:33.628 --> 00:34.961
We'll be careful, Miss Lewis.

00:36.298 --> 00:37.430
I'm sorry.

00:37.432 --> 00:38.715
I've got it.

00:38.717 --> 00:40.016
We just wanted to invite you

00:40.018 --> 00:41.468
to come trick or treating tonight.

00:41.470 --> 00:42.886
I think I'm a little old.

00:42.888 --> 00:44.104
Can we go, Ron, please?

00:44.106 --> 00:46.473
- Please?
- You can come, sure.

00:46.475 --> 00:48.835
We have to go by 7:00 or else
the good candy will be gone.

00:48.836 --> 00:49.776
Sounds perfect.

00:50.779 --> 00:52.428
Come on, girls.

00:53.431 --> 00:54.814
Bye, guys!

00:54.816 --> 00:56.116
See you later, Ron!

00:56.118 --> 00:59.536
See you tonight!

00:59.538 --> 01:01.104
What the hell just happened?

01:02.107 --> 01:07.707

01:22.209 --> 01:26.396
So, three bedrooms,
two baths, nice big backyard.

01:26.398 --> 01:28.431
But no trampoline room, correct?

01:28.433 --> 01:29.683
Correct.

01:29.685 --> 01:31.234
Like all houses in the world,

01:31.236 --> 01:34.104
there's no trampoline room.

01:34.106 --> 01:36.773
Ben is coming back
from D.C. in ten days

01:36.775 --> 01:38.742
and he we are moving
into a house together.

01:38.744 --> 01:40.110
He would move into my place,

01:40.112 --> 01:42.579
but it's a scary nightmare hoarder nest.

01:42.581 --> 01:44.564
His words.
And Ann's.

01:44.566 --> 01:47.233
And the official report
filed by the Health Department.

01:47.235 --> 01:50.370
I'm just so happy that Ben and I
are starting our life together

01:50.372 --> 01:54.374
and my future's finally back on track.

01:54.376 --> 01:55.926
Martha, I wanna lease this house.

01:55.928 --> 01:58.411
Great.

01:58.413 --> 02:00.373
Thought it was gonna be
more dramatic than that.

02:00.374 --> 02:00.881
Hold on.

02:00.883 --> 02:02.933
Okay, say it again.

02:02.935 --> 02:05.719
Martha, I wanna lease this house.

02:09.424 --> 02:12.442
Whoo!

02:15.979 --> 02:16.659
Parks Department!

02:16.660 --> 02:18.949
Chris Traeger, city manager, friend,

02:18.951 --> 02:21.601
aspiring life coach and recipient

02:21.603 --> 02:24.988
of Dr. Richard Nygard's award
for Most Improved Patient

02:24.990 --> 02:26.573
for my psychotherapy sessions.

02:26.575 --> 02:28.325
That's great, Chris.
Congrats.

02:28.327 --> 02:29.326
Thanks, Jerry.

02:29.328 --> 02:31.244
It's just a piece of paper

02:31.246 --> 02:34.464
and he only made it for me after
I specifically asked for it

02:34.466 --> 02:37.467
while crying loudly, but...

02:37.469 --> 02:39.920
It sure meant a lot to receive it.

02:39.922 --> 02:42.088
In honor of Halloween,
the city manager's office

02:42.090 --> 02:44.591
will be throwing a scary movie
night in the courtyard.

02:44.593 --> 02:48.261
Tonight's film is
the 1986 horror camp classic,

02:48.263 --> 02:51.348
<i>Death Canoe 4:</i>
<i>Murder At Blood Lake.</i>

02:51.350 --> 02:53.633
Seriously?
That's the best one!

02:53.635 --> 02:56.853
I hope no one minds
if I live tweet this bitch.

02:56.855 --> 02:58.455
I am coming dressed as my greatest fear,

02:58.456 --> 03:01.408
because Dr. Richard Nygard feels
that I should face my fears

03:01.410 --> 03:02.692
instead of running from them.

03:02.694 --> 03:04.995
He's very wise.
I see him five times a week.

03:04.997 --> 03:08.031
He holds my life in his hand
like a fragile little bird.

03:10.033 --> 03:10.834
See you tonight!

03:11.586 --> 03:14.504
Well, Congressman Murray
has an 18 point lead.

03:14.506 --> 03:18.324
Calloway is out of money
and has stopped campaigning.

03:18.326 --> 03:19.376
So, congratulations!

03:21.680 --> 03:23.847
- Great work, all of you!
- Yeah.

03:23.849 --> 03:26.600
- But especially me!
- Especially everyone.

03:26.602 --> 03:28.001
This was a team effort, really.

03:28.003 --> 03:29.803
But I was the best.
Thank you.

03:29.805 --> 03:31.221
You were all fantastic.

03:31.223 --> 03:33.063
Most of all me,
April Ludgate, the real hero.

03:33.064 --> 03:34.524
Thank you and you're welcome.

03:34.526 --> 03:35.942
Actually, April, if you want,

03:35.944 --> 03:37.343
you can head back to Pawnee early.

03:37.345 --> 03:39.029
- Wrap a few things up and...
- Great.

03:39.031 --> 03:40.196
Whoo!

03:40.198 --> 03:41.398
That's an exit.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.849
Gone, but never forgotten.

03:42.851 --> 03:45.318
Who was that?
I'm just kidding.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.620
Not bad, right?

03:46.622 --> 03:48.822
You know, I have to say, Murray
really came through...

03:48.823 --> 03:50.743
Yeah, yeah, this one's over.
We won. Great job.

03:50.744 --> 03:52.042
Blah blah blah.

03:52.044 --> 03:53.804
Let's talk about
what you're gonna do next.

03:53.861 --> 03:56.029
Well, I was gonna get a chicken parm

03:56.031 --> 03:58.048
and watch <i>Bladerunner.</i>

03:58.050 --> 04:01.367
Are you talking about,
like, job-wise?

04:01.369 --> 04:05.422
Yes, Ben, I am talking about,
like, job-wise.

04:07.092 --> 04:09.059
So you're a princess too, hey?

04:09.061 --> 04:12.211
For the last four years
everything has been princesses.

04:12.213 --> 04:15.682
Every book, every movie, every backpack.

04:15.684 --> 04:16.899
All princesses all the time.

04:16.902 --> 04:19.853
- That sounds fun.
- It's a nightmare.

04:19.855 --> 04:22.405
Excuse me, I just have to
file a quick report.

04:22.407 --> 04:24.190
I'm applying to the police academy soon

04:24.192 --> 04:27.610
and the manual says I have to
work on my observation skills

04:27.612 --> 04:34.901
so... Tree, leaves, night, sky,
hand. Andy's hand.

04:34.903 --> 04:37.203
Pfft. What else you got?

04:37.205 --> 04:40.090
No.
Vice principal emergency.

04:40.092 --> 04:42.208
- What is it?
- I have to leave.

04:42.210 --> 04:46.212
Some idiot kids were caught
pooping on the soccer field?

04:46.214 --> 04:47.430
Too bad.

04:47.432 --> 04:48.672
Guess trick or treating's over.

04:48.673 --> 04:50.884
- No, Mommy, no!
- I'm sorry.

04:50.886 --> 04:52.686
No, we can walk 'em around,
it's no problem.

04:52.688 --> 04:53.808
I mean, we just got started.

04:53.809 --> 04:56.473
That's so sweet of you.

04:56.475 --> 04:58.558
Now, ladies, Princess Mommy

04:58.560 --> 05:00.226
has to go take care of some bad guys,

05:00.228 --> 05:04.814
so you be nice to Ron and Andy, okay?

05:04.816 --> 05:07.567
Okay, let's go to the next house.

05:07.569 --> 05:10.320
I need to go to the bathroom.

05:10.322 --> 05:14.574
I-I have no idea
what to do about that.

05:16.278 --> 05:17.994
It's the death canoe.

05:17.996 --> 05:19.946
Get your foot
out the water, dumb-ass!

05:19.948 --> 05:21.631
It's blood lake.

05:21.633 --> 05:23.967
Now, I missed the first three
<i>Death Canoe</i> films.

05:23.969 --> 05:26.052
Why exactly is it a death canoe?

05:26.054 --> 05:28.254
- Does it tip over easily?
- Read my Twitter feed.

05:28.256 --> 05:30.790
I live tweeted the first three
this morning in preparation.

05:30.792 --> 05:34.427
In the fifth one,
the canoe's actually the hero.

05:34.429 --> 05:36.012
It's a crazy twist.

05:36.014 --> 05:37.597
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:37.599 --> 05:39.399
- You're the...
- The lady and you're the...

05:39.400 --> 05:41.101
- USA!
- Cool. Great.

05:41.103 --> 05:43.319
So hold on, what does this mean?

05:43.321 --> 05:45.655
It means Jen wants me
to keep working for her.

05:45.657 --> 05:50.493
There's a businessman in Florida
who wants to run for governor.

05:50.495 --> 05:52.015
Florida?
They have sharks in Florida.

05:52.016 --> 05:53.363
And swamps.
And swamp sharks.

05:53.365 --> 05:54.480
Do you mean alligators?

05:54.482 --> 05:56.366
Maybe.
Look, so are you gonna do it?

05:56.368 --> 05:58.201
I... I mean,
I just applied for a lease.

05:58.203 --> 05:59.953
- We were supposed to...
- I know,

05:59.955 --> 06:02.672
and I know this makes
the future a little murky,

06:02.674 --> 06:05.675
but right now everything's
really preliminary, okay?

06:05.677 --> 06:07.961
We'll know more in a week or so.

06:07.963 --> 06:11.381
Trick or treat!

06:11.383 --> 06:14.184
7:34 pm.
Man dressed as a nerd.

06:14.186 --> 06:15.386
Female dressed as crazy witch.

06:16.186 --> 06:17.554
Neither of us is in costume.

06:18.556 --> 06:20.840
Case closed.
Candy, please.

06:20.842 --> 06:23.860
Ron, Zoe broke my tiara!

06:23.862 --> 06:25.478
We both have the same tiara.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.313
Now she has one and I don't.

06:27.315 --> 06:29.348
- Okay.
- I didn't mean to, Ivy!

06:29.350 --> 06:31.736
Okay, well, let's just even things out.

06:33.238 --> 06:36.372
There. Now neither of you
has a tiara. Problem solved.

06:41.744 --> 06:43.913
Right in his face!

06:43.915 --> 06:47.250
"Sorry about your jaw, son."

06:47.252 --> 06:48.885
I mean, I just feel so powerless.

06:48.887 --> 06:51.704
Just when things start to turn
around and they fall apart.

06:51.706 --> 06:54.591
Now I know exactly how FDR
felt after Pearl Harbor.

06:54.593 --> 06:56.559
Look, you guys have survived this long.

06:56.561 --> 06:58.377
Please don't let this ruin your night.

06:58.379 --> 06:59.429
Let's have fun.

06:59.431 --> 07:00.871
It's Halloween.
You love Halloween.

07:01.715 --> 07:03.883
Hey, I know what would cheer you up.

07:03.885 --> 07:05.602
Let's go wait outside the bathroom for Tom

07:05.604 --> 07:07.153
and scare him.

07:07.155 --> 07:08.721
That would cheer me up.

07:10.725 --> 07:12.492
Okay.

07:12.494 --> 07:14.060
Ready and...

07:15.062 --> 07:16.029
Boo!

07:19.899 --> 07:21.117
Jerry, God. Gross.

07:23.255 --> 07:24.704
Jerry?

07:24.706 --> 07:26.789
Guys, I...

07:26.791 --> 07:28.711
God, I think he might be
having a heart attack.

07:28.712 --> 07:31.044
What? Are you serious?

07:31.046 --> 07:32.526
So much stuff is happening right now.

07:32.527 --> 07:33.930
- Okay, call 911.
- Okay.

07:33.932 --> 07:35.882
Just breathe, okay?
You're gonna be fine.

07:35.884 --> 07:37.967
Geez!
Did a dinosaur just fart?

07:37.969 --> 07:39.219
Jerry, get a grip.

07:39.221 --> 07:40.436
Sorry, guys.

07:40.438 --> 07:41.938
Apology not accepted.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.139
Stop talking, moron.

07:43.141 --> 07:44.590
I wish I could stop smelling.

07:44.592 --> 07:46.109
Dude.

07:46.111 --> 07:48.811
Seriously, Jerry,
did you eat farts for lunch?

07:48.813 --> 07:50.253
Tom!
Jerry's having a heart attack.

07:50.254 --> 07:51.174
No, I didn't know that.

07:51.175 --> 07:53.149
Jerry, you okay?

07:55.252 --> 07:57.641
Okay, I've got some magazines

07:57.642 --> 07:59.843
and those boring
word jumbles you like to do.

07:59.845 --> 08:01.245
Is there anything else you need, J?

08:01.246 --> 08:02.178
Maybe some Gas-X?

08:02.180 --> 08:03.930
Ha ha, Tom.

08:03.932 --> 08:05.532
How is he, Ann?
Give it to me straight.

08:05.533 --> 08:06.460
He's great.

08:06.461 --> 08:08.101
He should be out of here in a day or two.

08:08.103 --> 08:09.183
Doctor, medically speaking,

08:09.184 --> 08:11.064
how would you describe
what happened to Jerry?

08:11.065 --> 08:12.145
He had a mild heart attack.

08:12.490 --> 08:17.310
Yeah, but he also exhibited
excessive flatulence.

08:17.312 --> 08:19.329
Is there a term for having a heart attack

08:19.331 --> 08:21.364
while releasing so much gas?

08:21.366 --> 08:22.866
Not really.

08:22.868 --> 08:25.818
Gastrointestinal distress is
common during a cardiac event.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.253
I just want to hear the doctor

08:27.255 --> 08:28.654
say that Jerry had a fart attack.

08:28.656 --> 08:30.123
Is that too much to ask?

08:30.125 --> 08:31.841
Thank you so much.

08:31.843 --> 08:34.677
Look at all the balloons and
the flowers and the food and...

08:34.679 --> 08:37.212
my goodness, you're so sweet
to come visit this often.

08:37.215 --> 08:38.965
- Well, they did cause it.
- Hey.

08:38.967 --> 08:39.999
No.
That's okay.

08:40.001 --> 08:41.717
I'm glad this happened.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.919
I mean, I could do without
the mess of hospital bills,

08:43.921 --> 08:45.271
but no, this was a wakeup call.

08:45.273 --> 08:47.357
I'm gonna make some changes.

08:47.359 --> 08:49.893
I want at least another 30 years
with Gayle and my girls.

08:49.895 --> 08:51.394
Don't worry, Jerry, okay?

08:51.396 --> 08:54.397
You are gonna have the future
that you've always planned.

08:54.399 --> 08:56.366
Just leave it to us.

08:56.868 --> 08:59.486
Okay, so I have arranged
for the Parks Department

08:59.488 --> 09:02.355
to throw a huge garage sale
fundraiser for Jerry

09:02.357 --> 09:04.023
to help pay for his hospital bills.

09:04.025 --> 09:05.905
The Pawnee municipal employee
health care plan

09:05.906 --> 09:06.910
is kinda crappy.

09:06.912 --> 09:08.328
One time I sprained my wrist

09:08.330 --> 09:10.530
and our insurance claimed
that having a wrist

09:10.532 --> 09:12.215
was a pre-existing condition.

09:12.717 --> 09:14.417
Babe, how much should I sell this hat for?

09:14.419 --> 09:16.202
I don't know, eight cents?

09:16.204 --> 09:17.644
Honey, this is the hat I was wearing

09:17.645 --> 09:20.039
the first time I ever heard
<i>Vitalogy</i> by Pearl Jam.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.674
$900.

09:21.676 --> 09:23.709
Yeah, that sounds about right.

09:23.711 --> 09:25.545
Ron, you're not selling anything?

09:25.547 --> 09:27.880
I am selling this table.

09:27.882 --> 09:30.216
I made it.

09:30.218 --> 09:31.778
So when am I gonna meet your new lover?

09:31.779 --> 09:34.220
I'm afraid things have hit
a rough patch with Diane.

09:34.222 --> 09:36.739
She was not pleased with
my babysitting performance

09:36.741 --> 09:39.275
and left me a very loud message
on my cell phone.

09:39.277 --> 09:41.161
I'm sure she'll get over it

09:41.163 --> 09:43.229
if you just say you're sorry though.

09:43.231 --> 09:45.532
I like Diane, but I'm not sure

09:45.534 --> 09:48.067
if I'm ready for a whole family.

09:48.069 --> 09:50.236
If the kids ever wanted
to come to my place,

09:50.238 --> 09:52.222
I'd have to take a whole week off work

09:52.224 --> 09:54.757
just to undo the alarms and tripwires.

09:54.759 --> 09:57.093
Hey, that's my name.

09:57.095 --> 09:58.795
Yeah, that's my Chris Traeger box.

09:58.797 --> 10:00.797
All these boxes represent stuff

10:00.799 --> 10:02.748
from different eras
of ex-boyfriends.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.685
Here are those ankle weights I bought you

10:05.687 --> 10:06.919
that you liked so much.

10:06.921 --> 10:08.605
Recently Leslie pointed out

10:08.607 --> 10:10.523
that sometimes when I date someone,

10:10.525 --> 10:14.477
I kind of adopt that person's personality.

10:14.479 --> 10:16.229
The evidence is fairly damning.

10:16.231 --> 10:18.648
Chris Traeger...
exercise phase.

10:18.650 --> 10:21.067
Andy Dwyer...
my grunge phase.

10:21.069 --> 10:23.870
Tom Haverford...
my needless shopping phase.

10:23.872 --> 10:25.288
Also my credit card debt phase.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.990
Ann Perkins.

10:26.992 --> 10:29.292
Thank you so much for coming.
Good afternoon.

10:29.294 --> 10:32.245
As many of your know,
Jerry Gergich, our friend,

10:32.247 --> 10:34.414
has suffered a devastating fart attack,

10:34.416 --> 10:35.999
and we are here to help.

10:36.001 --> 10:38.384
So there are some special auction items

10:38.386 --> 10:39.969
I will be dealing with.

10:39.971 --> 10:42.222
The first item up for bid
is an inscribed autobiography

10:42.224 --> 10:44.224
from Pawnee newscaster Perd Hapley.

10:44.226 --> 10:47.644
The book's entitled <i>The Thing</i>
<i>About Me Is I'm Perd Hapley.</i>

10:47.646 --> 10:50.763
Anyway, let's start
the bidding at $20. $20.

10:50.765 --> 10:52.599
Thank you sir, for 20.
Do I see 30?

10:53.601 --> 10:56.019
Mr. Kurtzwilder, it might
be helpful if you told us

10:56.021 --> 10:59.672
why you want to be governor of Florida.

10:59.674 --> 11:00.857
Well, I guess you could say

11:00.859 --> 11:03.159
mine is the classic Florida success story.

11:03.161 --> 11:04.777
I went to SFU law school,

11:04.779 --> 11:07.497
I was working at a small firm in Orlando,

11:07.499 --> 11:10.333
and one day, bam, just like
that, gator eats penis.

11:10.335 --> 11:11.817
Excuse me?

11:11.819 --> 11:13.499
Well, that was my first high profile case.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.820
It was a classic Florida divorce.

11:14.821 --> 11:17.490
Guy cheats on his wife
with Dan Marino's masseuse,

11:17.492 --> 11:20.009
one day she cuts his junk off,
throws it in the Everglades.

11:20.011 --> 11:22.095
- Why not?
- Damn alligator ate it.

11:22.097 --> 11:24.881
And that case, that case made my career.

11:24.883 --> 11:27.634
Now, I just wanna give something back.

11:27.636 --> 11:30.520
Frankly, your path to victory is narrow.

11:30.522 --> 11:32.555
Governor Scott might be vulnerable,

11:32.557 --> 11:35.441
but you have very little name recognition.

11:35.443 --> 11:38.444
But the Barkley Group
is the best at what we do.

11:38.446 --> 11:41.698
We're not in the business
of losing elections.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.984
We can get you where you wanna go.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.940
I'm just saying, you should
have put "spoiler alert"

11:48.941 --> 11:50.221
on all those <i>Death Canoe</i> tweets.

11:50.222 --> 11:51.357
Also, not safe for work.

11:51.359 --> 11:53.910
You know, a lot of what you
wrote was really profane.

11:53.912 --> 11:55.828
That movie's 25 years old, Morris.

11:55.830 --> 11:58.331
And if you don't like how I
tweet, don't follow me.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.093
What are you doing now?
I'm talking to you.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.719
I'm live tweeting
this dumb-ass conversation.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.420
- You like that coat?
- Yeah.

12:04.422 --> 12:06.872
But $200?
It's used.

12:06.874 --> 12:10.259
I paid 150 for it,
then added the scorpion.

12:10.261 --> 12:11.701
You can't sell clothes at a tag sale

12:11.702 --> 12:12.822
for more than they're worth.

12:12.823 --> 12:14.097
Watch me.

12:16.401 --> 12:17.567
Got a minute?

12:17.569 --> 12:18.568
Sure.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.553
I-I didn't expect to see you

12:20.555 --> 12:23.439
after the... yelling
that occurred.

12:23.441 --> 12:24.724
Yeah, I was a bit stressed,

12:24.726 --> 12:27.026
but I'm not here to make excuses.

12:27.028 --> 12:30.747
I just wanted to say that I am
sorry for the way I reacted.

12:30.749 --> 12:33.032
Apology accepted.

12:34.034 --> 12:35.901
Do you wanna say anything to me?

12:36.153 --> 12:38.538
Yes.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.957
You look nice today.

12:42.459 --> 12:44.093
You broke my daughter's tiara.

12:44.595 --> 12:46.095
You ruined their Halloween.

12:46.097 --> 12:48.634
Don't you feel
a little bit bad about that?

12:51.636 --> 12:53.269
Okay...

12:53.771 --> 12:55.304
Too late.

12:55.306 --> 12:59.108
Good-bye.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.643
Dude, you're totally blowing this.

13:00.645 --> 13:03.312
I'm not gonna apologize.

13:03.314 --> 13:05.898
It wasn't even a real tiara,
for God's sake.

13:05.900 --> 13:08.601
Well, relationship over.
Too bad.

13:08.603 --> 13:10.436
My God, you are so sad.

13:10.438 --> 13:13.272
- I am not.
- Ron, she's right.

13:13.274 --> 13:15.354
I've trained extensively
in the art of observation.

13:15.355 --> 13:17.744
You are sad, and we know why.

13:17.746 --> 13:19.746
You didn't sell you table.

13:19.748 --> 13:22.582
And it's probably a little too expensive.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.917
No.

13:24.919 --> 13:26.952
Okay, this is our final auction item.

13:26.954 --> 13:28.788
It's a one-of-a-kind autograph

13:28.790 --> 13:31.758
from mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.292
Yeah, we need some big bids...

13:33.294 --> 13:34.960
Excuse me one second.

13:34.962 --> 13:37.463
Can you... t... just... okay.

13:37.465 --> 13:39.766
Hey, how was the meeting?

13:39.768 --> 13:44.136
Kurtzwilder wants me to run
his campaign from Florida.

13:44.138 --> 13:47.640
I'm not exactly sure when
the job would even starts,

13:47.642 --> 13:49.975
but it would probably mean
putting our plans on hold.

13:49.977 --> 13:51.310
Well, I mean, you know,

13:51.312 --> 13:53.312
obviously you gotta take it, right?

13:53.314 --> 13:54.914
No, I mean, I'm not making any decisions

13:54.915 --> 13:57.115
until we talk about this
and everything it would mean.

13:57.116 --> 13:58.984
Look, I'm flying back to Washington.

13:58.986 --> 14:00.506
I'll call you when I get there.
Okay?

14:00.507 --> 14:01.654
Yeah, okay.

14:01.656 --> 14:03.656
- Love ya.
- Love you, too.

14:03.658 --> 14:06.793
$55. Great.
Okay, come on, $60?

14:06.795 --> 14:08.177
$65 anybody?

14:08.179 --> 14:10.513
Hey, we're up to $60, not bad, right?

14:10.515 --> 14:11.831
Yes, Ann, bad.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.999
You might not care
about Jerry's future, but I do.

14:14.001 --> 14:16.636
Okay? We need to do something
very drastic so he can be happy,

14:16.638 --> 14:19.155
so we can all be happy.

14:19.156 --> 14:20.556
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

14:20.557 --> 14:21.837
Don't know what you're thinking,

14:21.838 --> 14:23.078
but I'm definitely not thinking

14:23.079 --> 14:24.759
- what you're thinking.
- Good idea, Ann.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.679
Okay, we have a new item up for bid.

14:26.681 --> 14:28.781
A wonderful surprise item.

14:28.783 --> 14:31.868
An evening with sexy nurse Ann Perkins.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.402
- No.
- Yes.

14:33.404 --> 14:35.220
Look at her, folks.

14:35.221 --> 14:37.461
One evening with the most
beautiful woman in the world.

14:37.462 --> 14:39.062
Just dinner and dancing, nothing sexual.

14:39.063 --> 14:40.743
Unless she's into that, but no, she's not.

14:40.744 --> 14:41.995
Nothing fresh.
Don't even try it.

14:41.996 --> 14:43.396
- But you never know, right?
- No!

14:43.397 --> 14:45.117
No, she's not into it.
Don't try anything,

14:45.118 --> 14:46.318
but, you know, give it a shot.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.679
Either way, it's for a good cause.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.169
Let's raise some money.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.459
Please, we need to do this

14:53.460 --> 14:54.793
for Jerry and his future.

14:54.795 --> 14:56.095
This could be great, you know?

14:56.097 --> 14:57.417
Three out of four married couples

14:57.418 --> 14:59.218
have met each other
at spontaneous auctions.

14:59.219 --> 15:00.466
I don't think that's true.

15:00.468 --> 15:04.203
- I d... well, I don't know, I...
- $100.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.939
All right, what the hell.

15:06.941 --> 15:09.108
Okay, we have a $100 bid for Ann Perkins.

15:09.110 --> 15:11.193
- 200.
- 200. Thank you so much.

15:11.195 --> 15:13.355
200 for the smartest,
most accomplished woman I know.

15:13.356 --> 15:14.480
And check out that bod.

15:14.482 --> 15:15.514
Can I get 3? $300.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.349
500.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.152
- $600.
- 700.

15:20.154 --> 15:22.571
- 750.
- $900.

15:22.573 --> 15:26.075
900 from the man with
the tank top and the tattoos.

15:26.077 --> 15:27.837
That's so great.
Let's beat that, shall we?

15:27.838 --> 15:29.795
Who wants to beat it?
Anybody beat it please?

15:29.797 --> 15:30.996
I'm sorry, I'm out.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.598
I wouldn't sell her to that guy, though.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.549
Just one man's opinion.

15:33.551 --> 15:34.717
Okay...

15:34.719 --> 15:38.337
Sir, what would you do
with your $900 date?

15:38.339 --> 15:43.509
How would you,
What are you gonna do to her?

15:43.511 --> 15:44.810
I don't know.

15:44.812 --> 15:46.812
My cousin's got a kickass
mud pit in his yard.

15:46.814 --> 15:48.134
She could watch me do belly flops

15:48.135 --> 15:49.775
then we maybe we could get some Thai food

15:49.776 --> 15:52.017
and a tank of nitrous
and see what happens.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.719
That's not as bad
as I thought it would be.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.739
I am going to bid
a million dollars on myself.

15:56.741 --> 15:58.776
Going once, going never, sold.

16:00.912 --> 16:03.232
Ladies and gentlemen,
the auction closes in five minutes.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.413
What up, playboy?

16:04.915 --> 16:06.081
You like that jacket?

16:06.083 --> 16:07.616
It's a pretty dope cut, right?

16:07.618 --> 16:09.334
Yeah.
Can I have it, Mom?

16:09.336 --> 16:10.536
I could wear it to homecoming.

16:10.538 --> 16:11.920
300 bucks for something

16:11.922 --> 16:14.790
you're just gonna grow out of
in a month? Forget it.

16:14.792 --> 16:17.092
Wait, I can rent it to you.

16:17.844 --> 16:18.877
Really?

16:18.879 --> 16:21.430
Yeah, it's part of a business I run.

16:21.432 --> 16:23.549
High end clothes rentals for teens, tweens

16:23.551 --> 16:25.050
and everything in betweens.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.219
That jacket is 20 bucks a week.

16:28.221 --> 16:28.920
Done.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.606
This is a great idea.

16:30.608 --> 16:32.768
He grows so fast I never wanna
buy him anything nice.

16:32.769 --> 16:34.893
What's the name of your business?

16:35.295 --> 16:36.645
Rent-a-swag.

16:37.147 --> 16:39.815
I'm sorry, Jerry, but your
future has been canceled.

16:39.817 --> 16:41.600
We only raised $1,200.

16:41.602 --> 16:43.452
Leslie, thank you.

16:43.454 --> 16:44.953
That is amazing.

16:44.955 --> 16:46.121
No, it stinks.

16:46.123 --> 16:47.823
It's not even close to what you need.

16:47.825 --> 16:49.792
With all your bills,

16:49.794 --> 16:51.543
and the inevitable
follow-up problems,

16:51.545 --> 16:53.996
and the lifetime of chronic
misery that awaits you.

16:53.998 --> 16:55.581
I mean, you had this whole plan

16:55.583 --> 16:57.749
for your retirement and your beach house

16:57.751 --> 17:01.804
and now you're future
is just a huge pile of crap.

17:01.806 --> 17:04.089
Leslie, you can't actually
plan your future.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.971
You know, there's no guarantees
in this world.

17:05.972 --> 17:09.127
As long as the people I love
are a part of my life

17:09.128 --> 17:11.597
I will be just fine.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.183
You wanna stick around?

17:14.185 --> 17:15.505
Watch some of my stories with me?

17:15.506 --> 17:18.319
Tonight's strawberry
Jell-o night!

17:18.321 --> 17:20.656
My God, your life is so depressing.

17:20.657 --> 17:22.773
No thank you.

17:24.662 --> 17:28.113
Never seen anyone
more tortured over good news.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.032
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to seem ungrateful.

17:30.034 --> 17:32.451
I just, you know,
I have a lot to consider.

17:32.453 --> 17:33.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

17:33.534 --> 17:35.014
Feelings and girlfriend and whatever.

17:35.015 --> 17:37.989
The point is just yesterday
you said to me,

17:37.991 --> 17:41.126
"I'm never happier than
when I'm managing a campaign."

17:41.128 --> 17:42.461
I don't think I said that.

17:42.463 --> 17:43.662
You didn't have to.

17:43.664 --> 17:45.180
I watched you in Florida.

17:45.182 --> 17:46.715
You were saying it with your heart.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.634
You are really good at this.

17:48.636 --> 17:50.385
Yes, I am.
I'm amazing.

17:50.387 --> 17:52.804
But more importantly, so are you.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.174
There aren't a lot of people
that can manage a campaign.

17:56.676 --> 18:02.564
But you, Ben Wyatt, are one of them.

18:02.566 --> 18:06.151
So, just take tonight and
just think about your future.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.526
Hello, Diane.

18:14.528 --> 18:17.796
I have brought you flowers.

18:17.798 --> 18:20.832
Also chocolates.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.334
And some grout cleaner.

18:22.336 --> 18:24.703
I noticed you needed grout
cleaner, so I brought that too.

18:24.705 --> 18:27.673
Very romantic.

18:27.675 --> 18:29.975
My kids are non-negotiable, Ron.

18:29.977 --> 18:32.227
It's a package deal.

18:32.229 --> 18:36.732
I know.
I'm sorry, Diane. I really am.

18:36.734 --> 18:39.401
I've been alone most of my life by choice

18:39.403 --> 18:41.937
and kids...

18:41.939 --> 18:45.107
this is all new for me.

18:45.109 --> 18:47.109
But I'd like to become familiar with it

18:47.861 --> 18:50.445
if you give me a chance to prove myself.

18:50.947 --> 18:53.249
I did bring the girls something.

18:55.251 --> 18:58.453
I thought I could teach 'em to saw.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.423
I now realize that seems dangerous.

19:02.909 --> 19:06.712
Well, my boyfriend might not
be moving back for a while

19:06.714 --> 19:08.847
so I have to back out.

19:08.849 --> 19:11.817
Just wanted to look at it one more time.

19:11.819 --> 19:13.619
You know I can't give you
your deposit back.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.553
I know.

19:14.555 --> 19:16.688
- And there's a $300...
- All right, Martha.

19:16.690 --> 19:20.559
I get it.

19:20.561 --> 19:23.729
Actually, is there a way
I could put down, like a...

19:23.731 --> 19:25.397
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:25.399 --> 19:26.999
I didn't know you were coming back here.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.619
What are you doing?

19:31.381 --> 19:33.405
My God, what are you doing?

19:33.907 --> 19:37.442
I'm thinking about my future.

19:40.129 --> 19:44.449
I am deeply, ridiculously in love with you

19:44.451 --> 19:47.552
and above everything else, I just...

19:47.554 --> 19:49.338
I wanna be with you forever.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.243
So, Leslie Knope,

19:52.840 --> 19:54.343
- will...
- Wait. Wait.

19:54.345 --> 19:55.978
- Okay?
- Okay.

19:55.980 --> 19:58.680
- Just... I need to remember this.
- Sure.

19:58.682 --> 20:01.933
- Gimme a second.
- Okay.

20:02.685 --> 20:05.303
- Leslie K...
- No, no, no, no, hold on.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.938
Just... I need another second,
please.

20:06.940 --> 20:13.645
I need to remember every little
thing about how perfect

20:13.647 --> 20:17.499
my life is right now at this exact moment.

20:17.501 --> 20:19.534
Okay.

20:28.844 --> 20:29.928
Are you good?

20:29.930 --> 20:31.129
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:31.131 --> 20:32.964
I'm good.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.001
Leslie Knope,

20:34.766 --> 20:36.001
- will you...
- Yes!

20:43.692 --> 20:45.110
- Marry me?
- Yeah.

20:45.112 --> 20:47.029
Okay. Great.

20:48.112 --> 20:53.029

20:54.376 --> 20:55.877
Trick or treat!

20:56.661 --> 20:58.212
It's November 8th.

20:58.246 --> 21:00.714
Yes, well, these girls didn't get a chance

21:00.748 --> 21:01.781
to go trick or treating

21:01.799 --> 21:03.417
so somewhere in this house

21:03.451 --> 21:04.951
there is some candy.

21:04.969 --> 21:07.888
Why don't you find it and we'll
get right out of your hair.

21:07.922 --> 21:11.975
All right, hold on one second.

21:12.510 --> 21:15.461
- You having fun, ladies?
- Yeah!

21:15.479 --> 21:20.483
All right, I got some, calcium chews

21:20.518 --> 21:22.936
and, a roll of cookie dough.

21:22.970 --> 21:24.237
Okay, what do you say, girls?

21:24.271 --> 21:26.139
Thank you!

21:26.157 --> 21:27.907
Tremendous.

21:27.942 --> 21:29.776
Appreciate it.
