It really is.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.138
What's your dream wedding?

00:13.138 --> 00:15.223
- Oh, I'm so glad you asked.
- (both laugh)

00:15.223 --> 00:18.935
- I don't know.
- Okay, I'll go first.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.187
- I think it'll be in
a church, of course.
- Mm.

00:21.187 --> 00:24.315
And it would be this cute
little church that I grew up in.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.775
And it's very tiny,

00:25.775 --> 00:29.154
and sort of, like,
surrounded by fields,

00:29.154 --> 00:30.780
and so it would be intimate

00:30.780 --> 00:33.116
and just close
family and friends.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.703
And I would wear something
really cute, you know?

00:36.703 --> 00:38.371
- Just festive.
- (giggles)

00:38.371 --> 00:40.123
But not, like, white or bridal

00:40.123 --> 00:42.000
- because you gotta
keep 'em guessing.
- No.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.462
- You gotta keep 'em guessing.
- (giggles)

00:45.462 --> 00:47.589
And I would walk down the aisle

by Laura Branigan.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.011

in my childhood,

I dreamed that I would
fly her in to sing it.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.057
But now, I have you.

00:58.057 --> 01:00.059
Oh, Joel.
You can't touch Branigan.

01:00.059 --> 01:03.313

I'm making her a funeral cake.
- Hm.

a tender gesture.

that's a lovely gesture.

- (slam)

09:17.974 --> 09:21.227
So, what were those other
pillow names that you had?

09:21.227 --> 09:22.895
Those ideas you came up with?

09:22.895 --> 09:25.356
- Will you just write them
down for me, please?
- (drops pen and paper)

09:25.356 --> 09:26.857
Oh, the cunt ones?

09:26.857 --> 09:28.442
- Yep, the cunt ones.
- Would be my great honor.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.027
You love making me say
that word, don't you?

09:30.027 --> 09:32.154
(laughs)
Yes, but not as much

09:32.154 --> 09:34.782
as you're gonna love
making all that money.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.076
You know Shannon
hasn't called or texted?

09:37.952 --> 09:39.537
- Oh really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.789
Sam:
That's weird.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.500
- Are you
texting her right now?
- No.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.879
- (sighs)
- Okay.

09:50.047 --> 09:54.468
Big... cunt... energy...

09:54.468 --> 09:56.095
Exclamation point.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.681
- (giggles)
- (refrigerator dinging)

09:58.681 --> 10:00.683
Whoa! What's
happenin' over here?

10:00.683 --> 10:03.686
Oh, well, that is
a birthday present
I bought for myself,

10:03.686 --> 10:06.647
but I can't figure out how
not to make the text go on it.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.149
- It's nice.
- You just...

10:08.149 --> 10:09.984
Well, it's just probably
synced to your phone.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.569
- Hm.
- Here, gimme your phone.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.820
- No. (laughs)
- Why not?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.071
I'm not giving you my phone!

10:14.071 --> 10:15.323
W-Why?

10:15.323 --> 10:17.241
Because you'll just
take pictures of your boobs

10:17.241 --> 10:18.701
- or something!
- Oh, my God, Tricia!

10:18.701 --> 10:20.202
I did that... once.

10:20.202 --> 10:23.039
It was more than once,
but whatever.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.458
(sighs)
I got nice tits, sorry.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.502
It also plays music,
if you're interested.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.880
- Seriously? Sick.
- Mm-hmm.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.008
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I just said "sick." (laughs)

10:35.384 --> 10:38.512
- Oh. Okay.
- (sensual music playing)

10:38.512 --> 10:40.181
I get what
you're doing here.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.100
- Oh no. Mm-mmm.
- Yeah, it's nice
and smooth, Tricia.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.101
Oh, I like these edges.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.187
If you go all the way down,

10:46.187 --> 10:48.064
feel all the way around,

10:48.064 --> 10:50.900
and you take the doors,
and you open 'em up...

10:50.900 --> 10:53.402
And, oh!
Oh, there you go.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.529
- And then you can just
take your hot little--
- So gross.

10:55.529 --> 10:56.530
Oh, no, no, no.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.741
- (laughing)
- Oh God, is this--

10:58.741 --> 11:00.576
Is this you trying
to make me believe
in love again?

11:00.576 --> 11:03.454
- Is that what that looks like?
- Oh, well, if it is, I'll stop.

11:03.454 --> 11:07.833
- Unlike you, I actually
do believe in love, so...
- Well, that's gross.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.169
- (music stops)
- So, did you nuke the butter?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.712
Yes. How'd you know?

11:11.712 --> 11:13.172
Because it looks
like a cow patty.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.882
Sam:
Well, that's what
I was going for.

11:14.882 --> 11:18.094
- Just a big hot dump
for your birthday.
- (laughing)

11:18.094 --> 11:20.388
Do you have any candles
so we can celebrate?

11:20.388 --> 11:22.890
- No, let's just
put our faces in it.
- Yes!

11:22.890 --> 11:26.769
Just like that, it was
finally signed into law

11:26.769 --> 11:29.188
by President Franklin Pierce.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.732
I could listen
to you talk about
the Kansas-Nebraska Act

11:31.732 --> 11:34.693
- all day.
- (laughs) I feel
like you just did!

11:34.693 --> 11:36.362
(both laugh)

11:36.362 --> 11:39.365
I really enjoyed every
second of it. For real.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.619
This cabin is typical

11:43.619 --> 11:45.996
of the first settlers
of Riley County.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.583
Usually, the windows were built

11:49.583 --> 11:52.128
with greased paper windows

11:52.128 --> 11:55.464
and holes
in the roof for smoke,

11:55.464 --> 11:57.967
so the chimney
and fireplace didn't--

12:09.395 --> 12:11.480
(Joel laughs lightly)

12:16.735 --> 12:19.780
I don't wanna move
things too fast, but...

12:19.780 --> 12:21.699
would you like to go
to the pancake feed

12:21.699 --> 12:23.617
- with me on Saturday?
- (laughs)

12:23.617 --> 12:26.954
- Yeah. I would.
- Yeah?

12:26.954 --> 12:30.583
But, I might need food
before Saturday, if you want.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.794
(laughs)
Do you wanna
go to The Chef?

12:35.171 --> 12:37.214
Yes. Yes.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.757
Um... Yes, totally.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.259
- If you don't want to--
- No, no, no, no.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.927
I love The Chef.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.054
I love their house-made
strawberry jam.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.307
(laughs)

12:46.307 --> 12:49.602
- Oh... (giggles)
- Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.105
(birds chirping)

12:53.105 --> 12:55.149
The recipe called for
half a cup of sour cream,

12:55.149 --> 12:56.692
but I just put the whole
fuckin' thing in.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.235
- (giggles)
- Nice and tangy, right?

12:58.235 --> 13:01.030
- (laughs)
- Mm-hmm. It's also...

13:03.574 --> 13:05.034
It's like it's wet.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.660
Well, wet is never bad.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.454
Oh, you should put
that on a pillow.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.248
- (both laugh)
- Mm.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.833
(puts down fork)

13:12.833 --> 13:14.793
You know what?
I mean...

13:14.793 --> 13:16.462
I'm just gonna
go for it this year.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.005
Just, like, go for it.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.382
Like, if it makes me happy,

13:20.382 --> 13:22.051
just F everybody else,
you know?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.594
- Good.
- Yeah. I mean, like,

13:23.594 --> 13:25.888
I can barely keep up
with these orders
as it is, you know?

13:25.888 --> 13:27.598
(Sam giggles)

13:27.598 --> 13:28.641
(sniffs)

13:29.808 --> 13:31.560
You know,
this is a take or leave,

13:31.560 --> 13:33.562
but you could call
your new company...

13:33.562 --> 13:36.023
Charity Cases.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.983
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!
That's not bad, right?

13:37.983 --> 13:39.193
- It's really good.
- (Sam laughs)

13:39.193 --> 13:41.362
- It's really good!
- She's thinkin' about it.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.614
I mean, I can't,
but maybe I can.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.704
Well...

13:51.455 --> 13:54.083
thank you for...

13:57.545 --> 14:00.089
- What, for the shitty cake?
- (laughs)

14:00.089 --> 14:01.632
No, I like the cake.
Thank you for the cake

14:01.632 --> 14:04.385
and for just making
this whole day...

14:05.344 --> 14:06.971
less shitty. (laughs)

14:09.223 --> 14:10.808
I've been, like...

14:11.517 --> 14:13.143
really...

14:13.143 --> 14:14.687
just kind of dreading
this birthday.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.273
Like, actually kind of really
freaking out about it, you know?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.483
- Yeah. Hm.
- 47.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.903
Yeah, it's a big one.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.406
Well, yeah, but, I mean,

14:25.406 --> 14:28.492
Holly was diagnosed
when she was 47, I mean...

14:31.161 --> 14:34.081
It's just...
It's just so unfair, and...

14:36.709 --> 14:40.337
I just feel like it's never
gonna be easier, you know?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.719
- (sniffles)
- Holly was 48, Tricia.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.515
When she was diagnosed.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.602
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.813
- (clears throat)
- No, what-- You said 47.
What are you talking about?

14:57.813 --> 15:00.482
- I know, I just misspoke.
It's not a big deal.
- No, you didn't.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.360
I mean, what is it
you're not telling me?

15:07.197 --> 15:10.534
She was 47, Sam,
when she was diagnosed.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.747
- What?
- Tricia: She was 47.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.957
- No, she wasn't.
- Yeah.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.292
She, um...

15:18.292 --> 15:20.753
She didn't want to worry you.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.130
She felt like she had it
all under control.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.674
She wanted to try to
beat it naturally.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.844
Well, you can't...
You can't beat cancer naturally.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.597
Who told her--
Who told her that
she could do that?

15:31.597 --> 15:34.391
I mean, it was her choice.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.726
Well, why would she
tell you and not me?

15:35.726 --> 15:37.311
- I never would've allowed that!
- Because, Sam,

15:37.311 --> 15:38.812
she didn't think
you could handle it.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.731
Oh my--
I could handle it!

15:40.731 --> 15:42.691
- (bangs table)
- Oh, my God.

15:44.026 --> 15:47.154
You must have loved
keeping this from me!

15:47.154 --> 15:48.864
- What? No!
- Oh, yes.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.532
Sam, I wanted to tell you.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.743
I couldn't because
I promised her.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.829
I thought that she
should tell you, but...

15:55.829 --> 15:58.415
of-of course she wanted
to protect you, Sam,

15:58.415 --> 15:59.458
'cause she was your protector.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.876
She always wanted
to protect you.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.380
But...

16:04.380 --> 16:07.841
I mean, please don't forget
that I was her sister, too.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.053
I mean, I lost her, too.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.681
And I miss her, too.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.059
But, you know,
there's just no point

16:17.059 --> 16:18.686
in us getting upset
about it right now.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.437
(sighs) Oh, it's too late.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.980
(sniffles, sighs)

16:21.980 --> 16:23.357
- Sam.
- What?

16:23.357 --> 16:25.109
Don't do this.
Just stay here.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.443
Please stay here
so we can talk it out.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.445
What do you wanna
talk about, Tricia?

16:28.445 --> 16:30.739
You lied, she lied,
and now I'm upset!

16:30.739 --> 16:32.157
- What else can I do for you?
- Okay. Okay.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.743
Sam, this is what you do
when you get upset.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.578
When you get mad,
when you feel
like someone's made

16:36.578 --> 16:38.080
a tiny mistake,
you cut them out.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.958
Oh, oh, no, no, no,
this-- this is not tiny!

16:40.958 --> 16:44.336
This is what you do!
You cut people out, Sam!

16:44.336 --> 16:47.464
You cannot keep doing that!
There won't be anybody left!

16:48.257 --> 16:50.384
(Tricia sighs)

16:50.384 --> 16:51.927
Actually, you know what?
Just leave.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.596
- I'm so sick of giving
a shit about you!
- Fucking... Fine.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.432
- Tricia: And you know what?
- Sam: What?

16:56.432 --> 16:57.683
This is why
you're always alone!

16:57.683 --> 16:59.893
Oh! Well, guess what?
We're both alone!

17:05.482 --> 17:06.608

17:07.860 --> 17:10.946

17:32.217 --> 17:35.304
- Darlene: Hi, Sam.
- Hi.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.680
I hope you don't
mind me coming by.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.476
I wanted to bring you
your tape of your last lesson.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.811
- Oh.
- In case you ever wanna
practice on your own.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.354
Thank you.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.443
- Yeah, I'm really sorry that
I ran out like that. I just--
- It's okay.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.111
I get it.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.072
You have a big heart,

17:54.072 --> 17:57.618
and when you sing,
it-it's right here.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.789
I know how overwhelming
that can be.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.749
Isn't it strange?

18:03.749 --> 18:07.044
Something that brings us
so much joy can...

18:07.044 --> 18:09.755
almost be too much to bear.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.091
Yeah.

18:13.091 --> 18:16.678
Well, you have the tape.
If you need anything...

18:18.013 --> 18:19.348
I'm always here.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.141
Thank you.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.685
You're welcome.

Darlene:
Hm.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.570
(sniffles)

18:39.243 --> 18:41.203
Keep singing, Sam.

18:41.203 --> 18:44.456
- We need you.
- (laughs) Okay.
