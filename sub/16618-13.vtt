- Uh-oh. The boss.

01:41.761 --> 01:43.728
Do you know what you've done?

01:43.763 --> 01:47.231
You won the Count the Buttons
in the Button Jar Challenge.

01:47.266 --> 01:49.567
Thanks to him, you all get
the rest of the day off.

01:49.602 --> 01:51.900
Go home.

01:51.902 --> 01:54.870
Live your lives. Don't look back.

01:54.905 --> 01:56.638
Smithers, the bodies.

02:02.246 --> 02:04.980
I had a great day, and I really
want to celebrate with the boys.

02:05.015 --> 02:07.582
So don't wait up for me, my sweet,

02:07.618 --> 02:10.418
wonderful bartender, Moe.

02:10.454 --> 02:12.154
All right, but who's the boys?

02:12.189 --> 02:15.190
Marge's boobs. See ya.

Patty and Selma's car?! D'oh!

02:29.606 --> 02:32.007
Homie, stop dropping
rhymes and get dressed.

02:32.042 --> 02:35.877
We're going to the 38th
annual DMV Awards.

02:35.913 --> 02:37.712
Aw, there are too many award shows.

02:37.748 --> 02:39.548
People don't deserve so many awards.

02:39.583 --> 02:42.584
People suck. They should just
be grateful to be alive.

02:42.619 --> 02:45.420
Get your best coffin suit,
'cause you're goin'.

02:45.455 --> 02:47.189
You're at table one,

02:47.224 --> 02:50.025
next to the bathroom,
furthest from the bar.

02:50.060 --> 02:53.028
Patty and Selma are producing
the Surlys this year.

02:53.063 --> 02:55.030
Hamilton's gonna win everything.

02:55.065 --> 02:57.432
Fred Hamilton. Window six.

02:57.467 --> 02:59.935
He can make every person in the room

02:59.970 --> 03:03.271
feel like their number is the
furthest from being called.

03:06.743 --> 03:10.445
You know, Selma, James Bond
has a license to kill.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.547
Stop forcing banter!

03:12.583 --> 03:16.284
But a lot of people would
kill for these licenses.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.787
Heckle! Heckle!

03:18.822 --> 03:20.789
For Funniest Vanity Plate,

03:20.824 --> 03:24.459
the nominees are I Heart Heart Doctors,

03:24.494 --> 03:26.628
from the writing team of...

03:26.663 --> 03:28.263
A team?!

03:32.269 --> 03:33.835
- Beep-beep, beep-beep.
- Beep-beep, beep-beep.

03:33.870 --> 03:36.838
Objects may be sexier than they appear.

03:38.442 --> 03:39.641
That's it. I'm leaving.

03:39.676 --> 03:41.576
Take me! You'd slow me down!

03:41.612 --> 03:44.246
Lisa Simpson here,
covering the Surly Awards

03:44.281 --> 03:47.449
for Springfield Elementary
School Radio, WSES.

03:47.484 --> 03:49.784
Ooh, here comes an audience member now.

03:49.820 --> 03:52.854
One guy in the In Memoriam reel
was alive when it started!

03:52.889 --> 03:54.623
Don't forget your gift bag!

03:54.658 --> 03:57.025
It's just a coupon for a
dollar off at the car wash,

03:57.060 --> 03:58.860
but if you don't have one,
the lady at the car wash

03:58.895 --> 04:01.363
will give you one from out of a drawer!

04:01.398 --> 04:03.198
Homie, come back!

04:03.233 --> 04:04.976
You're the next presenter!

04:04.978 --> 04:06.945
The winner is me 'cause I'm leaving!

04:07.337 --> 04:09.537
Stomach filled with rage.

04:09.573 --> 04:12.307
Must quench with French fries.

04:14.244 --> 04:15.810
Five Krusty Burgers. No tomato.

04:15.846 --> 04:18.813
Sorry, sir. We no longer
serve Krusty Burgers.

04:18.849 --> 04:22.617
But it's your name! It's as
if Macy's didn't sell Mace!

04:22.653 --> 04:25.186
Our corporate parent in Kumamoto, Japan,

04:25.222 --> 04:29.891
has instituted the following fun
and nonnegotiable changes...

04:31.862 --> 04:35.630
Hey, hey! Try our Buttermilk
Sriracha Sandwich,

04:35.666 --> 04:38.133
Kobe Shiitake Ciabatta Explosion,

04:38.168 --> 04:41.303
and Hanoi Honey Barbecue
Banh Mi Pho-furter.

04:41.338 --> 04:44.139
Get 'em quick, before they're Sai-gone!

04:45.876 --> 04:47.909
Oh, I just want a one-pound burger

04:47.944 --> 04:50.645
that a snake couldn't
fit its mouth around.

04:50.681 --> 04:53.315
Sorry. We no longer
sell the Python Buster.

04:53.350 --> 04:57.185
Would you like some Kombucha
Kimchi Mini Tacos instead?

04:57.220 --> 04:58.920
Just give me a cup.

04:58.955 --> 05:00.588
That's beet aioli.

05:00.624 --> 05:02.590
No!

05:04.245 --> 05:07.195
People! Beware! The crap you love to eat

05:07.230 --> 05:09.397
has been replaced by food!

05:26.083 --> 05:29.384
Heavenly Father, I know you're
a friend of the eating man.

05:29.419 --> 05:32.387
You created Sunday so
we can have brunch.

05:32.422 --> 05:35.957
Please, O Lard, shower me
with your divine grease

05:35.992 --> 05:37.959
and deliver me some egg rolls.

05:37.994 --> 05:40.962
Or pizza or hot dogs. Whatever
I can eat while driving.

05:40.997 --> 05:44.466
For thine is the flower
and the gravy forever.

05:44.501 --> 05:46.301
A menu

05:46.336 --> 05:48.703
would be great.

05:50.807 --> 05:52.941
Thank you.

05:55.112 --> 05:57.078
Help you?

05:57.114 --> 06:00.515
Um, what's the healthiest
thing in this place?

06:02.986 --> 06:05.553
Chewie, we're home.

06:05.589 --> 06:07.455
Chewie is what I call my mouth.

06:07.686 --> 06:10.365
I really don't care what
you call your mouth.

06:20.586 --> 06:21.885
Ah.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.688
Just in time for breakfast.

06:24.723 --> 06:26.356
Hi, guys.

06:26.391 --> 06:29.192
So, Homie, I'm sure you
have a good explanation

06:29.228 --> 06:31.391
- for where you were.
- The best.

06:31.555 --> 06:34.255
I was eating hot dogs.

06:34.291 --> 06:35.657
Hot dogs?

06:35.692 --> 06:38.259
That is so stupid it must be the truth.

06:38.295 --> 06:41.830
I bet you're picturing me
as a hot dog right now.

06:41.865 --> 06:43.765
Absolutely not!

06:45.669 --> 06:47.135
And these weren't just any hot dogs...

06:47.170 --> 06:50.038
they were Deuce's Caboose chili dogs!

06:50.073 --> 06:51.606
We were worried sick!

06:51.642 --> 06:52.841
What do you think we are,

06:52.876 --> 06:53.675
man?

06:53.710 --> 06:55.610
Take that.

06:55.646 --> 06:57.345
Ow! No fair!

06:57.381 --> 06:59.114
She nut-butted me.

06:59.149 --> 07:02.117
Deuce's Caboose, eh?

07:02.152 --> 07:04.619
We used to take you there
when you were a boy.

07:04.655 --> 07:06.354
I don't remember any of that.

07:06.390 --> 07:09.457
Well, you were young then,
and you're stupid now.

07:09.493 --> 07:12.627
Your mom and me dropped you off
there every Wednesday afternoon

07:12.663 --> 07:15.530
while we tuned up our marriage.

07:15.634 --> 07:16.485
Turn here.

07:16.486 --> 07:18.968
Oh, you just love to tell me what to do.

07:19.002 --> 07:22.391
We come here every week,
and you get lost.

07:22.393 --> 07:25.527
- Please stop fighting.
- Oh, you would just love it

07:25.563 --> 07:27.162
if we did that, wouldn't you?

07:34.939 --> 07:40.309
He'll take a small soda and
sit there for 50 minutes.

07:43.848 --> 07:46.949
Hey, kid, have a chili dog,

07:46.984 --> 07:48.384
on the house.

07:48.419 --> 07:51.921
If we split up, no one gets Homer!

08:10.308 --> 08:13.976
That's when I started
eating my emotions.

08:14.011 --> 08:16.845
Oh. You poor guy.

08:16.881 --> 08:18.514
Fat-man begins.

08:18.549 --> 08:21.183
Well, it taught me a great coping skill.

08:21.218 --> 08:24.620
Eating is to me what drinking is to me.

08:24.655 --> 08:27.790
I just wish I had
something aggravating in my life

08:27.825 --> 08:29.191
to make me hungry now.

08:29.226 --> 08:30.993
Hello!

08:31.028 --> 08:35.164
Uh, Homie, Patty and Selma
lost their jobs at the DMV,

08:35.198 --> 08:37.933
because they spent too
much on the award show.

08:37.969 --> 08:40.269
We went over the $43 budget.

08:40.304 --> 08:42.504
By $100,000.

08:42.539 --> 08:46.342
To save money, I said they
could live here for a while.

08:46.377 --> 08:49.278
And don't forget, we have
a baby and an iguana.

08:49.313 --> 08:51.280
And they both have
different sleep schedules.

08:51.315 --> 08:53.882
What they do have in common is diarrhea.

08:53.918 --> 08:56.418
And we forgot to bring diapers.

08:57.922 --> 09:01.290
Hey. You remember me as a kid, right?

09:01.325 --> 09:02.558
No, sir.

09:02.593 --> 09:05.561
But you called me your
"Little H-Dog," remember?

09:05.596 --> 09:07.563
Look, man, I'm getting up there.

09:07.598 --> 09:09.832
I can barely remember
the starting lineup

09:09.867 --> 09:12.901
of the 1961 Chicago Blackhawks.

09:12.937 --> 09:15.671
Uh, Bobby Hull; Al Arbour;

09:15.706 --> 09:17.673
Ed Litzenberger, captain;

09:17.708 --> 09:20.409
Stan Mikita; and... that's all.

09:20.444 --> 09:22.644
Also, Dollard St. Laurent.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.146
But not you.

09:24.181 --> 09:26.915
I'm sorry, sir.

09:32.957 --> 09:34.223
<i>Okay, people,</i>

09:34.258 --> 09:35.724
what have you got? We're being killed

09:35.760 --> 09:37.393
in the ratings by the
morning announcements.

09:37.428 --> 09:38.894
Attention,

09:38.929 --> 09:41.397
the bus that took 30
kids on a "field trip"

09:41.432 --> 09:43.332
was not from this school.

09:43.367 --> 09:46.502
If anyone's mom can go pick
up 30 students in Chinatown,

09:46.537 --> 09:48.837
it would be much appreciated.

09:48.873 --> 09:51.073
Why didn't we break that story?!

09:51.108 --> 09:55.077
Damn it, we're even being
beaten by Jimbo's podcast.

09:55.112 --> 09:57.513
Today on <i> Left, Right & Center,</i>
we'll discuss whether

09:57.548 --> 10:00.082
to punch someone in the
left, right, or center.

10:00.117 --> 10:01.917
Our special guest today

10:01.952 --> 10:05.254
is upside-down nerd,
Milhouse Van Houten.

10:05.289 --> 10:07.523
Thanks for having me back.

10:07.558 --> 10:09.758
Aren't we just supposed
to do the stories we want

10:09.794 --> 10:11.927
and not worry about ratings?

10:11.962 --> 10:13.695
That's kindergarten talk.

10:13.731 --> 10:16.932
This is professional fourth-grade radio.

10:18.502 --> 10:19.935
Meeting's over.

10:19.970 --> 10:22.037
I've got to put the balls back in.

10:22.073 --> 10:24.506
I'm the smartest ball in the bag.

10:25.910 --> 10:28.377
You could be replaced,
and it wouldn't be hard.

10:28.412 --> 10:30.045
A cinder block with a stretched-out belt

10:30.081 --> 10:31.980
would do the trick.

10:49.366 --> 10:51.266
No one's eating at my place.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.168
No one!

10:53.204 --> 10:56.905

11:47.992 --> 11:50.225

And I am here with the legendary
Nurple Purpler Nelson Muntz.

12:04.241 --> 12:07.209
Yo. Nelson, let me get right to it.

12:07.244 --> 12:08.810
Haw-haw!

12:08.846 --> 12:11.213
Where did that come from?

12:11.248 --> 12:14.249
Um... wow. First of all, great question.

12:14.285 --> 12:17.419
I guess I just saw a jerk
doing something lame,

12:17.454 --> 12:19.988
and I wanted to make the
dope feel like a dingus.

12:20.024 --> 12:24.426
Well, Mr. Muntz, I just happen
to have one of those "dingi"

12:24.461 --> 12:26.562
right here.

12:26.597 --> 12:29.598
Milhouse, how does it feel
to get a full Nelson?

12:29.633 --> 12:31.667
The first haw isn't that bad.

12:31.702 --> 12:34.503
But the second one is devastating.

12:34.538 --> 12:37.206
Wow!<i> Wow!</i>

12:37.241 --> 12:40.342
Sorry, Lisa. Funding has run
out for our radio station.

12:40.377 --> 12:42.678
I'm, uh, gonna have to
take back your hat.

12:42.713 --> 12:45.013
What?! Jeff and Becky broke up!

12:45.049 --> 12:48.784
Just before the story of the year!

12:52.590 --> 12:54.389
What's wrong, sweetie?

12:54.425 --> 12:56.525
They took away my radio station,

12:56.560 --> 13:00.796
which was the only source
of news in a 50-foot area.

13:00.831 --> 13:03.265
You could come with me
to the hot dog stand

13:03.300 --> 13:05.767
and do the word search
on the kids' menu.

13:05.803 --> 13:07.603
Do they have diagonals?

13:07.638 --> 13:12.140
Diagonals! That's where
"race car" was hiding.

13:14.178 --> 13:16.979
Oh, no, the hot dog stand is closed!

13:17.014 --> 13:20.082
The place I forgot for 30 years is gone!

13:23.087 --> 13:25.454
There's always a weak link.
There's always a weak link!

13:26.924 --> 13:28.957
We should help that man. He's choking.

13:28.993 --> 13:32.094
I remember when you used to
help me when I was choking.

13:32.129 --> 13:34.296
Why don't you ask the
girl at the hiking store?

13:34.393 --> 13:37.370
I gave her my number because
I was ordering boots.

13:39.047 --> 13:42.537
Don't let it be forgot
that on this shining spot

13:42.539 --> 13:45.239
was a place I really ate a lot.

13:45.670 --> 13:50.172
I don't see how you can blame
a man of 97 for retiring.

13:50.173 --> 13:53.073
- I thought we were the same age.
- So did I.

13:53.075 --> 13:56.042
Well, I hope you didn't
sell it to some clown.

14:09.626 --> 14:11.086
Here's a check.

14:11.088 --> 14:13.392
Welcome to the Krusty Burger family.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.261
And since we're family, we don't talk!

14:17.329 --> 14:18.762
Next problem.

14:18.797 --> 14:21.298
Oh! What else are you gonna change?

14:21.333 --> 14:24.768
We're gonna keep everything that
makes Deuce's Caboose great.

14:24.803 --> 14:26.737
Like the hot dogs and the caboose?

14:26.772 --> 14:29.940
No. God, no. We're already
talking to C-list actors

14:29.975 --> 14:31.942
about playing the owner in commercials.

14:31.977 --> 14:34.478
We're trying to find a
cheap Garrett Morris.

14:37.016 --> 14:39.583
Hot dogs, come with me
if you want to live!

14:42.855 --> 14:44.721
Somebody, stop them!

14:52.798 --> 14:55.098
That better be a monkey's
tail I'm feeling.

14:55.134 --> 14:57.100
Uh, chimps have no tails.

14:57.136 --> 14:59.503
Chimps have no tails?!

14:59.538 --> 15:01.004
Dad, what are we doing?!

15:01.040 --> 15:03.440
I'm saving a precious childhood memory!

15:03.475 --> 15:05.442
You realize this will
be my childhood memory,

15:05.477 --> 15:07.310
and maybe not so precious?

15:07.346 --> 15:09.312
That's a problem for grownup Lisa.

15:09.348 --> 15:10.781
All right, then.

15:17.990 --> 15:21.425
I certainly hope that isn't
your father's hot dog caboose.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.860
I have no end game!

15:23.896 --> 15:26.530
Oh, Lord! He's on the news so much,

15:26.565 --> 15:29.132
he has his own theme music now.

15:29.168 --> 15:30.701
♪ Go, Homer, go! ♪

15:30.736 --> 15:33.203
♪ Never know what he's gonna do! ♪

15:33.238 --> 15:34.771
Kent Brockman with you.

15:34.807 --> 15:36.606
You're watching Channel
6 Super Team Coverage

15:36.642 --> 15:40.043
of Chili Dog Day Afternoon
Weiner on a Roll.

15:40.079 --> 15:41.778
Indeed.

15:41.814 --> 15:45.182
Basically, I'm just watching
it like the rest of you.

15:45.217 --> 15:48.351
I guess you'd like some kind
of commentary or perspective.

15:48.387 --> 15:50.721
I don't have any, but I'd
like you to remember

15:50.756 --> 15:53.290
you're watching Channel 6...
the one that doesn't cut away

15:53.325 --> 15:54.691
when somebody dies.

15:56.595 --> 16:00.297
Chief Wiggum, maybe I can
defuse the situation.

16:00.332 --> 16:02.065
De-fuse. Huh.

16:02.101 --> 16:04.067
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

16:04.103 --> 16:05.569
Can you hand me your mic?

16:05.604 --> 16:07.204
Every police regulation says "no,"

16:07.239 --> 16:08.872
but do you know what says "yes"?

16:08.907 --> 16:10.373
What? Your eyes.

16:10.409 --> 16:11.942
Aw.

16:13.679 --> 16:16.813
This is Lisa Simpson,
a name you can trust,

16:16.849 --> 16:20.717
and I'm with Homer Simpson, a
man who just stole a caboose.

16:20.753 --> 16:23.019
My father is on quick-sided quest

16:23.055 --> 16:25.722
to save a greasy spoon
from being licked.

16:25.758 --> 16:28.725
I have to save that
caboose full of hot dogs,

16:28.761 --> 16:31.261
which is what my father called me.

16:35.801 --> 16:40.170
This aggression shall not
stand, so let us ride!

16:40.205 --> 16:43.373
Say, Colonel, which army were you in?

16:43.408 --> 16:45.342
Never you mind which army I was in

16:45.377 --> 16:47.377
and which courthouse we surrendered at.

16:47.412 --> 16:49.112
I said let's ride!

16:52.551 --> 16:54.084
I guess that's it...

16:54.119 --> 16:56.620
the one freeway chase
that ends in failure.

16:56.655 --> 16:58.588
No, it has not!

16:58.624 --> 17:00.957
We shall overeat!

17:30.088 --> 17:32.155
Yay!

17:32.191 --> 17:33.623
D'oh!

17:36.195 --> 17:38.328
I'm sorry, Dad. It's over.

17:38.363 --> 17:40.797
No, it's not!

17:45.671 --> 17:47.337
Krusty, run regular!

17:47.372 --> 17:50.140
I forgot how!

17:57.683 --> 18:00.617
So that's what it's for.

18:00.652 --> 18:04.321
No! I can't let my Little H-Dog die!

18:04.356 --> 18:06.523
You do remember me!

18:06.558 --> 18:09.793
I never forgot you! How could I?

18:10.529 --> 18:11.828
You were such a sweet,

18:11.864 --> 18:15.098
sad little boy, and I failed you.

18:15.133 --> 18:17.300
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did!

18:17.336 --> 18:20.270
You needed a father, and
all I could give you

18:20.305 --> 18:23.340
was steamed tubes filled
with chicken asses.

18:23.375 --> 18:26.142
But I love those chicken asses!

18:26.178 --> 18:28.511
I love... you.

18:31.350 --> 18:34.718
Your chili dogs didn't get me
through my childhood. You did!

18:34.753 --> 18:38.688
Suddenly this hot dog-covered
locomotive seems like a joke!

18:38.724 --> 18:40.523
Take my hand, son.

18:40.559 --> 18:43.026
It's strong from turning a can opener.

18:43.061 --> 18:44.794
Your chili was store-bought?!

18:44.830 --> 18:46.696
I didn't say I paid for it.

18:57.576 --> 19:00.310
- Mmm! - Oh, yeah!
- Ooh!

19:00.345 --> 19:02.145
- Oh!
- Ooh, yeah, baby!

19:02.180 --> 19:03.713
You're a hero, Dad!

19:03.749 --> 19:06.349
They're calling you Public
Elephant Number One!

19:06.385 --> 19:07.751
Well, I guess that's better than

19:07.786 --> 19:09.419
"Local Man Cut Out of Dressing Room."

19:09.789 --> 19:12.690
It sure is, Dad. It sure is.

19:14.359 --> 19:16.159
Chief, why are you letting him leave?

19:16.194 --> 19:18.828
He just committed a
series of serious crimes.

19:18.864 --> 19:21.898
Forget it, Lou. It's Chili Town.

19:44.279 --> 19:47.871
Gentlemen, I'm-a so tired
of all the bad-a blood

19:47.873 --> 19:49.185
between our companies.

19:49.367 --> 19:52.240
Can't we have a peace... of pizza?

19:52.242 --> 19:53.908
What are you doing?

19:53.944 --> 19:55.076
You fools!

19:55.111 --> 19:56.978
I'm a real person in here!

20:02.452 --> 20:05.053
