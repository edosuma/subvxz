WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:04.322
SO THEN THIS, UM, GUY
WITH PLIERS COMES IN,

00:04.370 --> 00:06.463
PROBABLY WITH SAFETY GOGGLES,
MAYBE SOME SORT

00:06.500 --> 00:08.195
OF FIRE RETARDANT COVERALL.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.505
HE STARTS DOING HIS THING,
TWISTING AND TURNING.

00:11.540 --> 00:12.632
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF FLUIDS

00:12.680 --> 00:14.329
JUST SPRAYING
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.507
THEN THIS HYDRAULIC LIFI'
COMES INTO PLAY,

00:16.550 --> 00:18.745
WHEELING EVERYTHING
OUT OF THERE.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.509
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
ALL RIGHT?

00:20.550 --> 00:22.108
LET'S CLEAN UP.
WAIT.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.617
THAT'S HOW BABIES
ARE BORN?

00:23.650 --> 00:25.538
YES?

00:25.590 --> 00:26.750
WITH A HYDRAULIC LIFI'?

00:26.790 --> 00:29.827
MORE OR LESS.
WAIT.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.350
BUT HOW ARE THEY MADE?

00:31.390 --> 00:34.257
UH, SEAN,
MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION,

00:34.300 --> 00:35.619
HOW MANY HATS ARE
IN THE ROOM?

00:35.660 --> 00:37.662
NONE.
HOW ARE THEY MADE?

00:37.700 --> 00:39.395
HATS? NOWADAYS, I HEAR
MOST OF THEM ARE MADE IN CHINA.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.668
LET'S GO.
FORGET IT.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.565
MAYBE I'LL GO ASK MOM.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.305
D-DON'T, NO! NO.
WAIT, WAIT, COME BACK HERE.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.468
COME BACK HERE, COME BACK HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

00:47.510 --> 00:51.071
UM...

00:51.110 --> 00:52.646
TUCK IN YOUR SHIRT
BEFORE YOU TALK TO HER.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.216
[scoffs]

00:54.250 --> 00:55.672
ALL RIGHT, TELL ME EXACTLY
WHAT SHE SAID.

00:55.720 --> 00:56.812
USE HER WORDS.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.818
SHE SAID, "HELLO.
THIS IS CHIEF VICK."

00:58.850 --> 01:01.512
IT'S A GOOD START, GUS.
I LOVE IT WHEN SHE SAYS THAT.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.152
"I HAVE SOMETHING BIG
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.327
"IT'S TOP SECRET.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.782
COME DOWN TO THE STATION
AS SOON AS YOU CAN."

01:05.830 --> 01:07.320
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT THIS MEANS?

01:07.360 --> 01:09.419
IT MEANS WE'RE TAKING IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.119
SHE SAID "BIG"
AND "TOP SECRET."

01:11.170 --> 01:12.762
THAT'S TWO OF OUR FAVORITE
'8OS MOVIES.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.631
I READ ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL
YACHT BANDIT.

01:14.670 --> 01:16.137
I BET YOU WE'RE GOING UNDERCOVER
ON A YACHT.

01:16.170 --> 01:17.467
GUS, LET'S NOT GET
AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

01:17.510 --> 01:18.602
SHE MAY WANT US
TO CATCH THAT GUY

01:18.640 --> 01:19.732
WHO'S BEEN STALKING
LINGERIE MODELS.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.838
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.599
LAST NIGHT ON THE NEWS,
I SAW SOMETHING ABOUT A BLIMP.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.504
BLIMP RIDES.
* BLIMP RIDES *

01:25.550 --> 01:27.518
SHOTGUN.
YOU CAN'T CALL SHOTGUN
ON A BLIMP.

01:27.550 --> 01:28.574
YOU CAN CALL SHOTGUN ANYWHERE

01:28.620 --> 01:30.417
EXCEPT A CROWDED
MOVIE TH EATER.

01:31.690 --> 01:33.510
ALL RIGHT, CLOSE THE BLINDS,
SHUT THE DOOR,

01:33.560 --> 01:35.289
AND REMAIN COMPLETELY SILENT.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.527
THIS IS BIG.

01:40.430 --> 01:41.727
[whispering]
THIS IS BIG.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.466
LOOK, I'M TRUSTING YOU BOTH
TO BE PROFESSIONAL

01:43.500 --> 01:44.467
AND TO KEEP THIS MATTER

01:44.500 --> 01:46.138
COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL.

01:46.170 --> 01:47.159
YOU GOT IT.
IF YOU KNEW

01:47.200 --> 01:48.633
HOW MANY SECRETS
I WAS KEEPING FROM YOU ALREADY,

01:48.670 --> 01:49.637
YOU'D TOTALLY TRUST ME.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.535
IT INVOLVES A NANNY.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.777
NANNY SERIAL KILLER.
NANNY ON THE RUN?

01:53.810 --> 01:55.402
NAN NY ARSONIST?

01:55.440 --> 01:56.646
DOES SHE FLY A BLIMP,
BY CHANCE?

01:56.680 --> 01:59.740
NO. I NEED YOU TO HIRE ME
A NANNY.

02:02.620 --> 02:05.714
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

02:05.750 --> 02:06.819
*

02:06.860 --> 02:08.555
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

02:08.590 --> 02:09.852
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

02:09.890 --> 02:11.585
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

02:11.630 --> 02:13.359
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

02:13.400 --> 02:14.697
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

02:14.730 --> 02:16.823
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

02:16.870 --> 02:18.758
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

02:20.940 --> 02:24.137
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

02:26.810 --> 02:27.936
OUR BIG CASE
IS FINDING YOU A NANNY

02:27.980 --> 02:28.901
FOR YOUR BABY?

02:28.940 --> 02:31.545
WELL, I'D BE HIRING YOU
PRIVATELY, OF COURSE.

02:31.580 --> 02:35.539
BUT I CANNOT STRESS
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.946
OF COURSE. OUR CHILDREN
ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCES.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.625
THAT. ALSO, I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN WEEKS.

02:42.660 --> 02:45.356
SEE, MY NEPHEW
WAS NANNYING HER.

02:45.390 --> 02:47.358
AND THEN HE WENT BACK
TO NURSING SCHOOL.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.753
AND EVER SINCE HE LEFI',
SHE WON'T FALL ASLEEP,

02:48.800 --> 02:50.199
WHICH MEANS
THAT I DON'T FALL ASLEEP.

02:50.230 --> 02:51.629
ARE YOU UP FOR THIS JOB?!

02:53.540 --> 02:54.666
I...

02:54.700 --> 02:56.736
YEAH. YEAH, I GUESS.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.567
OH.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.475
SEE, I CAN RUN
THE BACKGROUND CHECKS

03:00.510 --> 03:01.408
ON THE NANNIES.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.271
OF COURSE, NOT TO MENTION,
THE DRUG TESTING,

03:03.310 --> 03:04.277
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BRIEFINGS.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.370
BUT I WANT TO HIRE YOU BOTH
TO PSYCHICALLY READ

03:07.420 --> 03:08.512
THE BEST CANDIDATE.

03:08.550 --> 03:09.517
LOOK, CHIEF.

03:09.550 --> 03:10.517
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

03:10.550 --> 03:12.586
I THINK OUR SERVICES
MIGHT BE BE'I'I'ER UTILIZED--

03:12.620 --> 03:14.611
YOUR SERVICES
ARE BEST UTILIZED

03:14.660 --> 03:16.924
BY DOING EXACTLY
WHAT I SAY.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.985
YOU ARE NOT MY FIRST CHOICE,
MR. SPENCER.

03:19.030 --> 03:22.488
AND I CANNOT STRESS
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.964
I--NEED--SLEEP!

03:26.400 --> 03:27.594
ALL RIGHT, SO, UH,

03:27.640 --> 03:28.789
WHILE WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THIS BABYSI'ITER--

03:28.840 --> 03:29.864
(Vick and Gus)
NAN NY.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.598
HOW ABOUT
WE ALSO HOP ONBOARD

03:32.640 --> 03:33.902
THE YACHT BANDIT CASE?

03:33.940 --> 03:35.476
BECAUSE I THINK--

03:35.510 --> 03:36.670
OH, NO.

03:36.710 --> 03:37.847
NO, NO, NO.

03:37.880 --> 03:38.847
NO, NO WAY.

03:38.880 --> 03:39.869
IF I'M HIRING YOU PRIVATELY,

03:39.920 --> 03:41.012
THEN THIS IS THE ONLY CASE

03:41.050 --> 03:42.938
THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO BE WORKING ON.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.015
I MEAN, WHEN YOU'RE WORKING
ON POLICE CASES,

03:45.050 --> 03:47.587
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TAKE
PRIVATE CASES AS WELL.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.558
OR DO YOU?

03:52.560 --> 03:53.697
OF COURSE NOT.
WE DON'T DO THAT.

03:53.730 --> 03:54.492
THAT WOULD BE
UNPROFESSIONAL.

03:54.530 --> 03:55.827
IT WOULD BREAK
THE PSYCHIC/CLIENT...

03:55.860 --> 03:57.919
WE WOULDN'T EVEN
THINK OF IT.
CODE.

03:57.970 --> 03:59.961
GREAT. YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN.

04:01.670 --> 04:03.661
WELL, HARRY, YOU AND DEESHAW
START A TIMELINE.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.859
MCNAB, I WANT YOU TO HELP
SCHWARTZ

04:04.910 --> 04:06.036
GO OVER
THE WITNESS STATEMENTS.

04:06.070 --> 04:08.709
DOBSON!
I WANT YOU ON TACTICAL!

04:08.740 --> 04:10.605
WHERE THE HELL IS DOBSON?

04:10.650 --> 04:13.539

A REAL CASE.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.314

WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

04:17.350 --> 04:19.716
SOMETHING SOMETHING
LASSITER'S CASE.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.354
DUDE, THIS BLOWS
WITH A CAPITAL Z.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.824
SHAWN, THIS IS THE ONLY CASE
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING ON.

04:24.860 --> 04:26.657
BESIDES,
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.894
NANNIES ARE ESSENTIAL PARTS

04:27.930 --> 04:29.693
OF TODAY'S WORKING
NUCLEAR FAMILIES.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.693
MIGHT I REMIND YOU
THAT THIS IS A PRIVATE CASE

04:33.740 --> 04:34.968
FOR THE CHIEF OF POLICE

04:35.000 --> 04:36.399
TO FIND A CARETAKER
FOR HER CHILD?

04:36.440 --> 04:37.407
IF WE SCREW THIS UP,

04:37.440 --> 04:38.407
WE'LL BE ON HER BAD SIDE

04:38.440 --> 04:39.771
FOR PRETI'Y MUCH EVER.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.573
GUS, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO FIND A NANNY

04:41.610 --> 04:42.599
ON THE INTERN ET.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.708
IF THEY'RE POSTING THERE,

04:43.750 --> 04:44.876
THEY'RE ALREADY
TOO DESPERATE.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.741
IT'S LIKE ONLINE DATING.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.668
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WENT
ON MATCHMAKER.COM?

04:48.720 --> 04:49.948
YOU MEAN WHEN YOU POSTED
A PROFILE OF ME

04:49.990 --> 04:51.309
WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE?

04:51.350 --> 04:52.658
RIGHT--AND ALL THE WOMEN
WHO RESPONDED

04:52.690 --> 04:54.317
WERE COMPLETE FREAKS.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.679
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU SAID
I WAS LOOKING FOR A WOMAN

04:55.720 --> 04:56.948
WHO WAS STRONG ENOUGH
TO HOLD ME.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.322
I DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD
TAKE IT LITERALLY.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.093
LOOK, DUDE,
ALL THE GOOD NANNIES

05:02.130 --> 05:03.461
ARE EMPLOYED.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.899
WE GO'ITA DO SOME FIELD WORK.

05:04.930 --> 05:05.919
WE GOTI'A FIND
THE RIGHT NANNY

05:05.970 --> 05:06.937
AND STEAL HER
FOR CHIEF VICK.

05:06.970 --> 05:08.369
WE SHOULD GO TO A PLAYGROUND

05:08.400 --> 05:09.708
IN A REALLY
GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.105
THAT'S ACTUALLY
A GOOD IDEA.

05:11.140 --> 05:13.700
PLUS THIS WAY, WE CAN RACE
ON THE MONKEY BARS.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.746
YOU KNOW, GUS,

05:20.780 --> 05:22.748
WE MAY BE WORKING
THE LOWEST STAKES CASE

05:22.790 --> 05:24.485
OF OUR SHORT CAREERS,

05:24.520 --> 05:25.942
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT JUST SITTING

05:25.990 --> 05:28.618
AND ENJOYING A SUNNY DAY
AT THE PARK.

05:28.660 --> 05:30.685
SHAWN, CONCENTRATE.

05:30.730 --> 05:31.981
LOOK OVER THERE.

05:32.030 --> 05:33.395
THE ONE IN THE OVERALLS.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.795
SHE SEEMS TO BE USING
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY

05:34.830 --> 05:35.990
ON THAT TEN-YEAR-OLD,

05:36.030 --> 05:38.464
WHICH IS ACTUALLY
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.695
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA?
WHAT?

05:40.740 --> 05:45.803
PINEAPPLE AND MOVIE THEATER
POPCORN FLAVORED JELLY BEANS.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.808
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.501
SHAWN, STOP SPI'I'I'ING.
YOU'RE SCARING THE CHILDREN.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.678
HI. WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME CANDY?

05:57.090 --> 06:00.116
I CAN'T SAY THAT I BLAME HER.
THESE ARE DISGUSTING.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.809
I MEAN, THESE
ARE REALLY HORRIBLE.

06:01.860 --> 06:03.828
WHY CAN'T I STOP
EATING THEM?

06:03.860 --> 06:05.487
THAT'S IT.
WE'RE SPLI'ITING UP.

06:05.530 --> 06:06.758
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT
THE KIDS.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.791
AND ME.
FINE.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.759
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
I'M SERIOUS.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.097
(woman)
I MEAN, I THOUGHT

06:14.140 --> 06:15.960
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.503
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE RICH
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE SAFE.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.405
MARISSA, GET OFF
OF HER NOW!

06:20.440 --> 06:21.873
SO YOU KNOW ANNIE,

06:21.910 --> 06:23.878
SHE WORKED FOR THE BERMANS.

06:23.910 --> 06:25.571
SHE HAD TO GO
TO THE POLICE STATION

06:25.610 --> 06:27.168
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
SHE MIGHT BE A MATERIAL WITNESS

06:27.220 --> 06:29.609
'CAUSE OF WHEN THE HOUSE
BY THEM GOT ROBBED.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.083
SO--DAKOTA!

06:31.120 --> 06:33.588
LET SOMEONE ELSE
GO ON THE SLIDE!

06:33.620 --> 06:37.420
THEY SPOIL THAT LITTLE GIRL
SO HARD.

06:37.460 --> 06:38.927
SO THEN, AN--

06:42.770 --> 06:43.862
PERRY! LUKE!

06:43.900 --> 06:45.527
I'LL BE SITTING
RIGHT HERE.

06:45.570 --> 06:48.767
REMEMBER,
STRANGER DANGER!

06:48.800 --> 06:50.199
"STRANGER DANGER."

06:50.240 --> 06:51.707
THE PARENTS MAKE ME
SAY THAT.

06:51.740 --> 06:53.071
HI, I'M SHAWN.

06:53.110 --> 06:56.443
I'M, UH, I'M A MANNY
AROUND HERE.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.072
OH, I'M ADA.
THIS IS JAYNIE.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.479
ARE YOU WITH AN AGENCY?

07:00.520 --> 07:03.910
NO, I DON'T MODEL.
STRICTLY A MANNY.

07:03.950 --> 07:06.487
[laughs]

07:06.520 --> 07:09.751
UM, NO, MOST OF THE FAMILIES
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

07:09.790 --> 07:11.189
GET THEIR NANNIES
FROM OUR AGENCY.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.697
OH, WHICH ONE
IS THAT?

07:12.730 --> 07:13.754
RED BALLOON.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.755
YOU SHOULD TALK TO THEM

07:14.800 --> 07:15.755
ABOUT GETTING REASSIGNED.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.767
ADA'S FREAKING OUT

07:16.800 --> 07:17.824
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T FEEL SAFE

07:17.870 --> 07:19.565
WORKING IN THE HEIGHTS ANYMORE.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.737
WHY NOT? OH, GOSH.

07:20.770 --> 07:21.998
IS THERE A LOT OF CRIME
AROUND HERE?

07:22.040 --> 07:23.166
WHAT KIND?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.235
JUST SOME BURGLARIES.
JUST?

07:25.270 --> 07:26.931
ALL THESE HOUSES.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.106
ONLY THREE.

07:28.140 --> 07:30.005
THREE THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.200
THEY ALL HAPPEN IN, LIKE,
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY,

07:32.250 --> 07:34.673
AND ALL OF THEM
HAD SECURITY SYSTEMS

07:34.720 --> 07:36.119
AND EVERYTHING,
AND IT DIDN'T MATTER.

07:36.150 --> 07:37.947
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
YOUR STUFF THEY'RE STEALING.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.014
SO WHAT DO YOU CARE?

07:39.050 --> 07:41.018
I DON'T LIKE TO BE
AROUND IT.

07:41.060 --> 07:44.552
CODY! WYOMING, GET YOUR FOOT
OUT OF THAT DOG!

07:55.600 --> 07:57.704
WHICH ONE IS YOURS?

07:57.740 --> 08:00.629
OH, UH, I'M THE NANNY
FOR THOSE TWO.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.602
OH, REALLY.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.208
DO THEY ALWAYS FIGHT
LIKE THAT?

08:04.250 --> 08:05.945
PRETTY MUCH.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.049
WHICH ONE'S YOURS?

08:07.080 --> 08:10.538
OH, NO KIDS. JUST ME.

08:10.590 --> 08:13.753
SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON DISCIPLINE?

08:13.790 --> 08:15.758
DO YOU SPANK?

08:20.900 --> 08:21.889
HERE YOU GO.

08:21.930 --> 08:23.067
THANK YOU.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.067
YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.795
IS THAT YOUR NANNY
RIGHT THERE?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.089
NO. SHE IS.

08:29.970 --> 08:31.801
OH.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.875
SO SHE DOESN'T ALWAYS
PAY ATTENTION

08:32.910 --> 08:34.537
TO WHERE YOU ARE, HUH?

08:34.580 --> 08:36.036
IT WOULD BE PRETTY EASY
FOR YOU TO GET AWAY

08:36.080 --> 08:38.640
AND SHE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.211
[laughs]

08:43.250 --> 08:46.754
KIDS. I JUST WANT
TO EAT 'EM UP.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.092
NONE OF THESE NANNIES
WILL TALK TO ME.

08:56.130 --> 08:57.620
EVEN THE KIDS
ARE AVOIDING ME.

08:57.670 --> 08:58.625
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

08:58.670 --> 08:59.659
DO I SMELL WEIRD?

08:59.700 --> 09:01.691
[sniffs]
NAH, IT'S JUST THE USUAL.

09:01.740 --> 09:03.833
JERK CHICKEN
AND NEW CAR SMELL.

09:03.870 --> 09:05.132
LOOK, I WAS TALKING
TO THOSE TWO NANNIES, RIGHT?

09:05.170 --> 09:07.809
OH YEAH? YOU THINK THEY MAY
BE RIGHT FOR CHIEF VICK?

09:07.840 --> 09:08.807
NAH. THEY'RE TERRIBLE.

09:08.840 --> 09:09.738
YELLING AT THE KIDS,
GOSSIPING.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.077
ALL THEY PAID ATTENTION TO
IS THEMSELVES.

09:11.110 --> 09:12.748
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS,

09:12.780 --> 09:15.271
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
IS RIFE WITH CRIME.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.686
[police siren]
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.244
SHAWN, I THINK YOU'RE FORGETTING
WHY WE'RE HERE.

09:20.690 --> 09:21.782
DID YOU REALLY
JUST DO THAT?

09:21.820 --> 09:22.889
WHAT?

09:22.930 --> 09:25.649
HEY, GUYS!

09:25.690 --> 09:26.588
BUZZ!

09:26.630 --> 09:28.689
LISTEN, I GOT A CALL
ABOUT TWO CREEPY DUDES

09:28.730 --> 09:30.869
HANGING OUT
IN THE PLAYGROUND.

09:30.900 --> 09:31.924
REALLY.

09:31.970 --> 09:34.188
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING.
BUT I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.561
YEAH, WE'VE JUST BEEN HERE
HANGING OUT IN THE BUSHES.

09:38.740 --> 09:39.707
OH, BOY.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.038
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.189
I'M SO SORRY.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.915
HEY, NO HARD FEELINGS,
RIGHT?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.382
OF COURSE NOT.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.980
I MEAN, IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A JACKIE EARLE HALEY MOMENT,

09:57.030 --> 09:59.749
YOU'D--YOU WANT IT TO BE
FROM BAD NEWS BEARS.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.018
MAYBE BREAKING AWAY.
NOT LITTLE CHILDREN.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.721
LISTEN, I'D BE HAPPY
TO GIVE YOU GUYS A RIDE

10:03.770 --> 10:04.759
TO WHEREVER YOU NEED
TO GO.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.631
[man over intercom]
A'I'I'ENTION ALL OFFICERS.

10:06.670 --> 10:09.059
WE HAVE A CALL ON A 4-5-9
BREAK-IN AT 3192 ROSCOE.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.237
THERE. WE NEED
TO GO THERE.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.909
YOU NEED TO GO
TO A CRIME SCENE?

10:12.940 --> 10:14.009
YEAH, IT'S CRAZY.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.803
THE CHIEF ASKED US
TO LOOK INTO ANY NEW BURGLARIES

10:15.840 --> 10:16.943
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WHILE WE WERE HERE...

10:16.980 --> 10:18.174
AT THE PARK.

10:18.210 --> 10:19.711
OKAY. FINE. HOP IN.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.645
NO. WHY YOU ALWAYS GET
TO SIT IN THE FRONT?

10:23.690 --> 10:25.043
I CALLED SHOTGUN.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.910
SHOTGUN.
SH--

10:35.160 --> 10:36.821
CHIEF VICK BETTER NOT
CATCH US HERE, SHAWN.

10:36.870 --> 10:37.928
WOULD YOU RELAX?

10:37.970 --> 10:40.029
SHE'S NOT GONNA SHOW UP
AT SOME RANDOM BURGLARY SCENE.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.298
WE SPENT ALL AFTERNOON
ON THAT NANNY THING.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.968
THIS IS LIKE A COFFEE BREAK.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.072
THE COOLEST
COFFEE BREAK EVER.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.218
THIS IS SO WRONG, SHAWN.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.787
THAT MUST BE WHY
IT FEELS SO GOOD.

11:05.190 --> 11:06.794
WE ALREADY HAVE A CASE.

11:06.830 --> 11:08.127
GUS, WE CAN DO BOTH.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.424
IT'S CALLED MULTITASKING.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.767
OKAY, LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
CAME HOME.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.835
KICKED OFF THEIR SHOES.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.895
MADE SOME CHAMOMILE TEA.

11:14.940 --> 11:15.964
WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO THROWING BACK

11:16.000 --> 11:17.035
A FEW BEERS AFTER WORK?

11:17.070 --> 11:18.765
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO CLEANING?

11:18.810 --> 11:20.232
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.139
WHOEVER BROKE IN,
MANAGED TO DISARM SECURITY,

11:26.180 --> 11:28.273
FIND THE SAFE
AND OPEN IT.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.469
AND KILLED A GUY.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.887
SO THIS IS WHERE MR. TEATIME
GOT STEEPED.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.150
THAT DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE SENSE.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.953
GOT BREWED?
GOT TEA BAGGED!

11:36.990 --> 11:39.424
THAT MUST BE
WHAT KILLED HIM.

11:39.460 --> 11:41.018
GOOD EYE, GUS.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.254
THANK YOU.

11:42.300 --> 11:45.121
SO MR. TEATIME
WASN'T FEELING WELL.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.889
HE COMES HOME EARLY,
SURPRISES THE INTRUDER.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.066
THE MURDERER DIDN'T HAVE
A WEAPON.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.738
REACHES FOR THE FIRST THING
HE CAN FIND.

11:50.770 --> 11:51.862
BAM. DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYBODY.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.969
HE'S JUST
A NORMAL THIEF, RIGHT?

11:54.010 --> 11:56.399
DUDE--I BET THIS IS CONNECTED
TO THOSE ROBBERIES

11:56.440 --> 11:58.908
THE NANNIES
WERE TALKING ABOUT.

11:58.950 --> 11:59.939
CHIEF VICK!

11:59.980 --> 12:02.448
MAN, WE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.983
I THINK WALKING LIKE THIS
MAKES EVERYTHING MORE EXCITING.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.179
I DO NOT THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.891
SHE WAS CLEAR
ABOUT ONLY WANTING US

12:12.930 --> 12:13.954
TO FIND HER A NANNY.

12:14.000 --> 12:14.819
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

12:14.860 --> 12:15.929
I'LL HAVE A PSYCHIC VISION

12:15.960 --> 12:17.188
ABOUT THE WHOLE STRING
OF ROBBERIES.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.367
SHE WILL LOVE IT.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.936
I HAVEN'T FINISHED
THE REPORT YET.

12:19.970 --> 12:20.937
(Vick)
IS YOUR OTHER ARM
IN A SLING?

12:20.970 --> 12:21.937
EXCUSE ME?

12:21.970 --> 12:22.959
I DON'T WANT EXCUSES,
CARLTON.

12:23.010 --> 12:23.965
I JUST WANT THE REPORT.

12:24.010 --> 12:24.965
I'M NOT GIVING EXCUSES.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.068
THEN WHY ARE YOU
STILL TALKING?

12:26.110 --> 12:28.772
HEAD DETECTIVE,
MY ASS.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.300
UH, LISTEN,
I CAN FINISH THE REPORT.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.341
I CAN DO MY OWN JOB,
O'HARA.

12:32.380 --> 12:34.917
I KNOW YOU--
I CAN DO MY OWN JOB,
O'HARA!

12:36.580 --> 12:40.152
AW. WHO FINISHED THE COFFEE,
DIDN'T MAKE A FRESH POT?

12:40.190 --> 12:42.078
I MEAN, WHO DOES THAT?

12:42.120 --> 12:44.384
WHAT KIND OF PERSON

12:44.430 --> 12:45.954
ACTS LIKE THAT?

12:45.990 --> 12:47.855
WE SHOULD GO.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.197
OOH, SHAWN, GUS, HI!

12:49.230 --> 12:52.836
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
COME ON IN. COME ON IN.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.963
SO YOU FOUND ME A NANNY.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.309
ACTUALLY, WE WERE WORKING
ON THAT WHEN--
I HAD A VISION.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.979
IT WAS A ROBBERY
TURNED TO MURDER.

13:00.010 --> 13:00.806
THERE'S A LIGHT--

13:00.840 --> 13:02.239
OH, DO YOU KNOW
WHO THE MURDERER IS?

13:02.280 --> 13:03.406
UNLESS YOU CAN NAME ME

13:03.450 --> 13:04.542
THE MURDERER IN TEN SECONDS,

13:04.580 --> 13:05.808
THEN I'M NOT INTERESTED.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.147
TEN, NINE, ONE.

13:07.180 --> 13:09.148
I HIRED YOU TO FIND ME A NANNY,
AND THAT'S IT.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.511
YES, THAT'S IT.

13:10.550 --> 13:11.312
ABSOLUTELY.

13:11.350 --> 13:12.908
BUT, CHIEF,
I HAVE THIS FEELING.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.279
MR. SPENCER, I THOUGHT
YOU UNDERSTOOD

13:14.320 --> 13:15.582
THAT WHEN I HIRED YOU,

13:15.620 --> 13:17.929
THIS WAS TO BE
YOUR TOP PRIORITY.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.349
YOUR ONLY PRIORITY.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.960
IT IS. THIS IS IT.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.262
IN FACT, WE EVEN
NARROWED IT DOWN

13:24.300 --> 13:25.961
TO THE FINAL THREE
CANDIDATES.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.889
HO. HO.

13:28.940 --> 13:30.999
GO FIND THREE CANDIDATES.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.071
(Julie)
THIS HAS TO BE CONNECTED

13:35.110 --> 13:36.372
TO THE OTHER BURGLARIES
IN THE HEIGHTS.

13:36.410 --> 13:37.843
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.006
NO, YOU GO AHEAD.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.472
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY
A QUICK HELLO.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.818
OKAY.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.951
HOLD ON A SECOND. I MIGHT NEED
TO MAKE THAT A LARGE.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.092
CAN I HELP YOU?

13:54.130 --> 13:55.449
YOU GUYS WANT
TO GO IN WITH ME

13:55.500 --> 13:56.592
ON A MEAT-LOVER'S
CHEESY CRUST?

13:56.630 --> 13:57.961
NO TIME FOR A PIZZA PARTY,
SPENCER.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.262
(Shawn)
NOTHING HELPS A BIG CASE

13:59.300 --> 14:01.097
MORE THAN A BELLY FULL
OF PEPPERONI.

14:01.140 --> 14:01.959
WE'RE BUSY.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.103
OKAY.

14:03.140 --> 14:04.107
KEEP IT A MEDIUM,

14:04.140 --> 14:04.959
BUT YES TO THE CRAZY BREAD.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.898
IT MAKES SENSE
THAT ALL TH ESE BURGLARIES

14:06.940 --> 14:08.100
WERE CONNECTED 'CAUSE
THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME M.O.s.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.630
DAYTIME BURGLARIES...
DAYTIME BURGLARIES.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.045
HIDDEN VALUABLES
FOUND AND STOLEN.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.001
DISABLED ALARM SYSTEMS.

14:12.050 --> 14:14.439
YES. THAT'S WHAT I WAS
IN THE MIDDLE OF SAYING.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.016
WELL, THEN SAY IT.

14:16.050 --> 14:17.586
UH, HOLD ON A SECOND.

14:17.620 --> 14:20.589
UH, JALAPEO POPPERS,
CINNAMON WINGS?

14:20.620 --> 14:21.587
WALK AWAY.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.952
OKAY.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.878
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

14:25.930 --> 14:28.194
NOW IF YOU ALL CAN JUST
WAIT HERE FOR ONE SEC--

14:28.230 --> 14:31.028
SHAWN, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.423
'SCUSE ME.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.668
JEAN HAS A BACKGROUND
IN MONTESSORI,

14:36.700 --> 14:38.008
AND SUE HAS SOME
INTERESTING IDEAS

14:38.040 --> 14:39.974
ABOUT ESTABLISHING
NAP TIME ROUTINES

14:40.010 --> 14:42.433
THAT I KIND OF LIKE.
ALL RIGHT.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.140
NO. NO GOOD.
NONE OF THEM.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.249
WHAT? WHY?

14:47.280 --> 14:48.542
[sighs]

14:48.580 --> 14:51.048
SLOB, PSYCHO, SLUT.

14:53.090 --> 14:54.114
I SPENT HOURS
INTERVIEWING THEM,

14:54.160 --> 14:55.309
CALLING REFERENCES.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.419
AND YOU JUST COME IN HERE
AND DISMISS THEM IN TWO SECONDS?

14:57.460 --> 14:58.427
WELL, TAKE A LOOK, GUS.

14:58.460 --> 14:59.654
THE ONE ON THE FAR LEFT
IS A SLOB.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.499
SHE'S SMELLING
HER OWN ARMPIT.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.092
PSYCHO THERE HAS BEEN
SCRIBBLING IN HER DIARY

15:04.130 --> 15:05.995
FROM THE MOMENT I WALKED IN.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.964
SO? MAYBE SHE'S
JUST CREATIVE?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.139
IT'S THE SAME SENTENCE
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

15:10.170 --> 15:10.966
NOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT SENTENCE IS,

15:11.010 --> 15:13.001
BUT THERE IS NO CONFIGURATION
OF WORDS

15:13.040 --> 15:14.507
THAT MAKES
THAT BEHAVIOR ACCEPTABLE.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.269
FINE.
THAT STILL LEAVES FIONA.

15:16.310 --> 15:19.143
WHY IS SHE A SLUT?

15:19.180 --> 15:21.910
THAT WAS MORE ME
PREDICTING HER FUTURE.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.349
AW, MAN.
WHAT?

15:30.390 --> 15:33.598
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY OUT.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.121
SORRY, LADIES.
THE POSITION HAS BEEN FILLED.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.229
DON'T DRIVE ANGRY.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.632
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

15:41.670 --> 15:43.001
GUS, SHE WAS
GETTING MARRIED.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.167
SO? SHE CAN STILL WORK
FOR CHIEF VICK.

15:45.210 --> 15:48.179
NO, SHE'S CONSUMED
WITH PLANNING HER WEDDING.

15:48.210 --> 15:49.438
SHE WAS STUDYING
THAT BRIDAL MAGAZINE

15:49.480 --> 15:51.300
LIKE IT WAS A TEXT BOOK.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.647
AFTER SHE'S DONE
WITH THAT,

15:52.680 --> 15:54.318
SHE'LL BE ON THE FERTILITY
FAST TRACK.

15:54.350 --> 15:56.215
THEN SHE'LL HAVE
HER OWN BABY.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.480
AND CHIEF VICK
WILL BE OUT ANOTHER NANNY.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.182
AND I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE
TO DO ALL THIS WORK AGAIN.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.381
AND WHAT WORK EXACTLY
ARE YOU DOING?

16:03.430 --> 16:05.523
HOW ABOUT PROGRESS
ON OUR ACTUAL CASE?

16:05.560 --> 16:07.198
LOOKS LIKE
ALL THESE ROBBERIES

16:07.230 --> 16:08.652
ARE INSIDE JOBS.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.191
THE KEY IS FINDING THE
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE VICTIMS.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.164
BUT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE OTHER HOUSES

16:13.200 --> 16:14.189
THAT WERE ROBBED.
SHH.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.229
ALL I'M SAYING IS--
SHH.

16:15.270 --> 16:16.339
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY--
SHH.

16:16.370 --> 16:18.031
DON'T MAKE ME SLAP YOU,
SHAWN.

16:18.070 --> 16:19.059
CHECK IT OUT.

16:19.110 --> 16:20.509
I GOT SOME SNAPSHOTS
OF THE EVIDENCE.

16:34.490 --> 16:35.616
WELL, AT LEAST TWO
OF THE VICTIMS

16:35.660 --> 16:37.025
HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.027
WHAT?

16:38.060 --> 16:41.393
STARTEK. SECURITY COMPANY.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.790
AND YOU DON'T FIND IT STRANGE

16:44.830 --> 16:45.922
THAT ALL FOUR
OF THESE HOMES

16:45.970 --> 16:49.098
HAD STARTEK SECURITY,
YET NONE OF THEM WERE SECURE?

16:49.140 --> 16:51.233
ACTUALLY, PEOPLE GET
OVERCONFIDENT

16:51.270 --> 16:52.669
WITH A SECURITY SYSTEM
AND NEGLECT

16:52.710 --> 16:54.337
TAKING EVEN
THE MOST BASIC PRECAUTIONS.

16:54.380 --> 16:58.100
LIKE TURNING THE SYSTEM ON,
FOR EXAMPLE.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.799
SO YOU'RE SAYING
ALL OF THESE HOMEOWNERS

16:59.850 --> 17:02.171
JUST FORGOT TO TURN ON
THEIR ALARMS?

17:02.220 --> 17:03.346
THAT'S ONE THEORY.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.641
THAT'S A PRETTY FLIMSY
THEORY.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.089
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.087
(Shawn)
WHAT I'M GOING TO NEED

17:07.120 --> 17:08.212
FROM YOU, SPOCK,
IS A LIST.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.716
I JUST TOLD YOU, YES,

17:09.760 --> 17:11.523
I AM SECOND IN COMMAND.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.289
BUT MY NAME
IS GARY MILLS.

17:13.330 --> 17:14.558
I'M AT A LOSS.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.591
YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK TO BONES
AND GET BACK TO ME.

17:16.630 --> 17:19.167
JULES. LASSIE.

17:19.200 --> 17:19.996
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

17:20.030 --> 17:21.531
WELL, I WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

17:21.570 --> 17:24.164
AND MY EARS
STARTED TINGLING.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.359
AND THEN THEY GOT POINTIER.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.776
OH, AND MY HAND.
MY HAND STARTED DOING THIS.

17:27.810 --> 17:28.834
ALL ON ITS OWN.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.370
LIKE IN THAT SHOW.
STAR TREK.

17:30.410 --> 17:33.846
AND THIS IS STARTEK.
HILARIOUS. WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.279
EXCUSE ME
FOR TRYING TO TAKE YOU

17:35.320 --> 17:37.379
ON A WONDERFUL
PSYCHIC JOURNEY, OKAY?

17:37.420 --> 17:38.682
I THINK THERE'S A CONNECTION

17:38.720 --> 17:39.641
BETWEEN THIS PLACE

17:39.690 --> 17:42.614
AND THE STRING OF ROBBERIES
IN THE HEIGHTS.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.150
HOW'D YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE ROBBERIES?

17:44.190 --> 17:46.078
I, UH, FELT A BURNING
WHEN I SAT DOWN.

17:46.130 --> 17:47.097
FORGET I ASKED.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.394
PLEASE EXCUSE
MY PSEUDO-COLLEAGUE'S PRESENCE.

17:49.430 --> 17:51.125
NOW ASSUMING...

17:51.170 --> 17:53.195
THAT ALL FOUR
OF OUR HOMEOWNERS--

17:53.240 --> 17:54.832
DIDN'T JUST "FORGET"
TO TURN ON THEIR SYSTEMS,

17:54.870 --> 17:57.259
I THINK A STARTEK EMPLOYEE

17:57.310 --> 17:58.732
COULD'VE GOTTEN
THOSE ACCESS CODES TO BREAK IN.

17:58.770 --> 18:00.476
YOU REMIND ME
OF ONE OF MY PROFESSORS.

18:00.510 --> 18:02.398
DID YOU EVER TEACH
AT DEVRY SCHOOL OF TECHNOLOGY?

18:02.440 --> 18:04.271
NO.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.447
WELL, I HAD ONE
OF THESE PROFESSORS

18:05.480 --> 18:08.119
WHO OFTEN HAD
HAREBRAIN THEORIES LIKE YOURS.

18:08.150 --> 18:10.118
IF WE WERE REALLY GONNA ROB
ANY OF THE HOUSES

18:10.150 --> 18:11.139
THAT WE MONITOR,

18:11.190 --> 18:12.282
WE WOULD CHOOSE ONE

18:12.320 --> 18:14.356
IN A TOTALLY HIGHER
INCOME BRACKET.

18:14.390 --> 18:17.279
TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS MANSION, HUH?

18:17.330 --> 18:20.356
I WOULD ROB THIS BAD BOY
SO FAST YOUR HEAD WOULD SPIN.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.164
REALLY. HOW?
LASSITER, I DON'T--

18:23.200 --> 18:24.497
O'HARA, PLEASE.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.297
(Gus)
WHAT DO YOU WANT, SHAWN?

18:26.330 --> 18:28.662
[Shawn on cell]
GUS, THERE'S NO WAY
IT CAN BE THESE SECURITY GUYS.

18:28.700 --> 18:29.860
I MEAN,
THEY WANT TO BE COPS,

18:29.900 --> 18:31.401
BUT THEY'RE REALLY JUST
ON DOMESTIC DETAIL.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.772
REALLY? LIKE YOU'RE
A WAN NABE DETECTIVE

18:33.810 --> 18:35.277
FOLLOWING A CASE
WE'RE NOT EVEN ON,

18:35.310 --> 18:37.642
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE FINDING
CHIEF VICK A NEW NANNY.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.908
I TRUST YOU TO HEAD
THAT UP, GUS.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.417
MEANWHILE, I'M GOING
TO BORROW YOUR CAR,

18:40.450 --> 18:42.418
CHECK OUT THOSE OTHER HOUSES
THAT WERE ROBBED.

18:42.450 --> 18:43.417
NO WAY.

18:43.450 --> 18:44.485
I WILL NOT HAVE MY ECHO

18:44.520 --> 18:46.283
BE A PART OF YOUR FLAGRANT
DISOBEYING OF THE CHIEF.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.480
USE YOUR MOTORCYCLE.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.159
DUDE, I CAN'T DO RECON
WITH THAT

18:50.190 --> 18:51.384
ON SUBURBAN STREETS.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.648
HELP ME FIND THE NANNY,
AND THEN I'LL TAKE YOU.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.622
[laughs]
GUS, I'M A GROWN MAN.

18:55.660 --> 18:57.491
I DON'T HAVE TO DEPEND
ON OTHERS TO DRIVE ME AROUND.

18:57.530 --> 18:58.519
OKAY?

18:58.570 --> 18:59.764
FINE.

19:03.270 --> 19:04.760
OOH, SLOW DOWN.
SLOW DOWN.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.368
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR AGAIN?

19:06.410 --> 19:09.436
MY KINKAJOU. HE'S GOT TO BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.675
MAYBE HE'S MORE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE BLOCK.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.371
YOUR KIN KA-WHAT?

19:13.420 --> 19:14.944
KIN KAJOU.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.618
IT'S A 12-INCH,
MONKEY-LIKE MAMMAL.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.948
IT'S BECOME QUITE VOGUE
TO KEEP AS A PET.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.413
DERMOT MULRONEY HAD ONE
NAMED "BABY LOVE."

19:21.460 --> 19:23.951
BUT I NAMED MINE
"RED HOT MONKEY LOVE."

19:23.990 --> 19:25.218
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN,
CUT THE CRAP.

19:25.260 --> 19:26.284
I'M ONLY DOING THIS

19:26.330 --> 19:27.399
'CAUSE YOU AGREED
TO MOW THE LAWN.

19:27.430 --> 19:28.397
IT'S TIME TO FESS UP.

19:28.430 --> 19:29.351
WHAT IS REALLY
GOING ON HERE?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.628
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.297
THERE'S BEEN A STRING
OF ROBBERIES IN THE HEIGHTS,

19:32.330 --> 19:33.888
AND I NEED TO GET A CLOSER LOOK
AT ONE OF THE HOUSES

19:33.940 --> 19:35.362
THAT GOT ROBBED.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.697
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
SAY SO?

19:41.840 --> 19:43.444
ALL RIGHT, WHICH ONE?

19:43.480 --> 19:44.504
THAT ONE.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.816
YEAH? WELL, THAT'S
A STUPID HOUSE TO ROB.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.841
DOES ANYONE LIVE UP
TO YOUR STANDARDS?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.778
MAYBE WE CAN GET A HOLD
OF THE BURGLAR'S NUMBER.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.788
YOU CAN CALL. TELL HIM
HOW DISAPPOINTED YOU ARE.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.425
SHAWN, TAKE A LOOK
AT ALL THE HOUSES ON THIS BLOCK.

19:57.460 --> 19:58.358
OF ALL OF 'EM,
TELL ME WHY THAT ONE

19:58.390 --> 20:01.291
WOULD BE YOUR LAST CHOICE
TO BREAK INTO?

20:01.330 --> 20:02.592
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.
1--

20:02.630 --> 20:04.564
SHAWN. NOW.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.671
BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER HOUSES
ARE EASIER TARGETS

20:15.710 --> 20:17.974
THAN THE ONE
THAT ACTUALLY GOT ROBBED.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.898
NEIGHBOR TWO HOUSES DOWN
HAS BEEN GONE FOR SEVERAL DAYS.

20:19.950 --> 20:21.918
DIDN'T BOTHER TO SUSPEND
THEIR NEWSPAPER DELIVERY.

20:21.950 --> 20:22.974
GOOD. WHAT ELSE?

20:23.020 --> 20:24.510
THE HOUSE
ON THE OTHER SIDE

20:24.550 --> 20:26.381
IS COMPLETELY HIDDEN
BY THOSE TREES AND BUSHES.

20:26.420 --> 20:27.887
IT'S THE PERFECT VANTAGE POINT
FOR A BURGLAR.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.887
ESPECIALLY DURING
THE DAY TIME.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.729
NOT TO MENTION OUR HOUSE
HAS A SECURITY SYSTEM.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.557
AND BARS
ON THE WINDOWS.

20:32.590 --> 20:35.024
THIS WAS NOT A CRIME
OF CHANCE, SHAWN.

20:35.060 --> 20:38.268
THAT HOUSE WAS CHOSEN
FOR A REASON.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.268
[as Christopher Lambert]
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.392
WHAT?

20:41.440 --> 20:43.431
WHAT? I THOUGHT WE WERE
DOING LINES FROM HIGHLANDER.

20:43.470 --> 20:44.505
MY BAD.

20:44.540 --> 20:45.962
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

20:46.010 --> 20:49.400
[as Sean Connery]
WAIT. THAT SENSATIONAL FEELING.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.647
THAT IS THE QUICKENING.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.569
EVERYONE CAN DO CONNERY.
YOUR LAMBERT SUCKS.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.043
[scoffs]
AT LEAST I HAVE A LAMBERT.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.638
HEY, ADA, IT'S JAYNIE.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.783
THEY LET ME OUT EARLY.
WANT TO MEET UP TONIGHT?

21:02.520 --> 21:05.455
A NANNY WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO AFFORD COACH SUNGLASSES,

21:05.490 --> 21:06.559
AM I RIGHT?

21:06.590 --> 21:07.352
WELL, SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.857
NANNIES ARE CRIMINALLY
UNDERPAID.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.027
RIGHT. BECAUSE OUR CHILDREN
ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCES.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.697
NO, BECAUSE CHILDREN
ARE MADDENING HELLIONS.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.389
A GREAT NANNY CAN MAKE ALL
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.032
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN NANNY 911?

21:17.070 --> 21:19.300
NO, I'M STILL TRYING TO CATCH UP
ON MY DOG WHISPERERS.

21:19.340 --> 21:20.898
NANNIES ON THERE
ARE BRILLIANT.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.805
I WISH I HAD ONE OF 'EM
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.899
UH, DON'T BEAT
YOURSELF UP, POP.

21:24.950 --> 21:29.011
SURE, MOST OF MY GOOD TRAITS
COME FROM MOM.

21:29.050 --> 21:30.449
BUT YOU, UH...

21:31.650 --> 21:34.585
NO, THAT'S REALLY
ALL I GOT.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.823
OKAY, CHIEF.
LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING NO.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.567
WE HAVE NOT FOUND YOU
A NANNY YET.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.569
BUT I HAVE HAD A VISION
ABOUT NANNIES, IRONICALLY.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.965
RINGS OF NANNIES!

21:52.570 --> 21:55.437
UH, RINGS OF--
OF AROUND MY COLLAR.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.936
OF THIEVES.
RINGS OF THIEVES!

21:56.980 --> 21:59.073
SUPPLEMENTING
THEIR PALTRY INCOMES

21:59.110 --> 22:00.839
AS NANNIES.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.680
ROGUE NANNIES
ROBBING THEIR BOSSES'

22:04.720 --> 22:07.382
AYKROYDS AND BELUSHIS.

22:07.420 --> 22:08.512
NEIGHBORS!

22:08.560 --> 22:10.778
ROBBING THEIR BOSSES'
NEIGHBORS!

22:10.830 --> 22:12.559
CHIEF, IF I CAN JUST GET

22:12.590 --> 22:14.558
A LITTLE CLOSER
TO THESE ROBBERIES--

22:14.600 --> 22:15.521
AND--AND--AND WE WOULD STILL

22:15.560 --> 22:16.527
FIND YOU A NANNY

22:16.560 --> 22:18.562
EVENTUALLY.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.507
OH, MR. SPENCER.
I'M SORRY.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.838
I MUST'VE FALLEN ASLEEP.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.030
THAT IS SO CREEPY.
YOUR EYES WERE WIDE OPEN.

22:30.080 --> 22:33.379
YEAH. I LEARNED TO DO THAT
BACK WHEN I WAS ON STAKEOUTS.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.773
I HAVE NEVER

22:34.820 --> 22:38.608
BEEN SO SLEEP-DEPRIVED
IN MY LIFE.

22:38.650 --> 22:41.551
BUT THANK GOODNESS
YOU FOUND ME A NANNY.

22:41.590 --> 22:42.488
N-N-NO.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.987
NO, WE HAVEN'T--
WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.624
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

22:46.660 --> 22:47.752
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.051
[laughs nervously]

22:49.100 --> 22:51.125
I'VE GOT SOME VERY STRONG
PSYCHIC RUMBLINGS

22:51.170 --> 22:52.728
ABOUT THOSE ROBBERIES.

22:52.770 --> 22:54.738
[laughs]

22:56.440 --> 22:59.659
I GAVE YOU EXPLICIT
INSTRUCTIONS.

22:59.710 --> 23:00.904
AND YOU'RE HERE
TO TELL ME

23:00.940 --> 23:03.545
THAT YOU'VE COMPLETELY
DISREGARDED

23:03.580 --> 23:05.002
EVERYTHING I SAID?

23:05.050 --> 23:06.677
NO, NO, NO.
NOT COMPLETELY.

23:06.710 --> 23:07.847
WELL, LOOK,

23:07.880 --> 23:10.519
IF YOU'RE GONNA PUT IT
LIKE THAT,

23:10.550 --> 23:11.881
THEN SORT OF.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.753
WELL.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.827
LET ME PUT IT
JUST LIKE THIS.

23:17.860 --> 23:19.521
AND LISTEN VERY CLOSELY.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.595
BECAUSE I WANT YOU

23:20.630 --> 23:23.463
TO GET IT CLEARLY
THIS TIME.

23:24.670 --> 23:28.094
YOU...ARE...

23:28.140 --> 23:29.664
FIRED.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.861
YEAH.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.674
AH. FROM WHICH CASE?

23:34.710 --> 23:37.702
ALL OF THEM.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.715
TRYING TO SOLVE THAT CASE
IS WHAT GOT US

23:43.750 --> 23:44.978
IN TROUBLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE, SHAWN!

23:45.020 --> 23:47.557
SHE SAID SHE WANTED ME
TO NAME THE MURDERER.

23:47.590 --> 23:48.682
AS LONG AS I COULD DO IT
IN TEN SECONDS.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.655
AND AS LONG AS IT DIDN'T
DISTRACT FROM THE NANNY SEARCH.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.726
SO YOU FIND THE PERFECT NANNY
BEFORE SHE DOES.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.557
I'LL FIND THE MURDERER
FOR THE POLICE.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.522
AND VOILA,
SHE'S LOVING US AGAIN.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.662
AND EXACTLY HOW
IS THIS PLAN DIFFERENT

23:58.700 --> 24:00.224
FROM WHAT
WE WERE DOING BEFORE?

24:00.270 --> 24:03.068
BECAUSE NOW WE'RE RENEGADES,
DUDE.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.534
IT'S SO HARDCORE!

24:05.570 --> 24:06.969
WORKING WITHOUT
THE CHIEF'S KNOWLEDGE.

24:07.010 --> 24:09.672
RACING AGAINST A TICKING CLOCK
FOR HER APPROVAL.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.701
IT'S GONNA BE
SO MUCH MORE EXCITING.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.876
CAN'T YOU FEEL IT?

24:12.910 --> 24:14.548
NO, SHAWN.
I DON'T FEEL IT.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.808
I FEEL DEPRESSION.

24:15.850 --> 24:18.717
I FEEL A SERIES
OF MISSED PAYMENTS ON OUR RENT.

24:18.750 --> 24:19.819
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MOTIVATES ME

24:19.850 --> 24:21.511
TO THINK WE NEED
TO FIX THIS.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.619
I NEED TO GET MORE INFORMATION
ON THOSE TWO NANNIES

24:23.660 --> 24:24.922
FROM THE PARK.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.689
MAYBE GET INTO THAT AGENCY
WHERE THEY BOTH WORK.

24:26.730 --> 24:28.095
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN
ON DOING THAT?

24:28.130 --> 24:30.189
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN PRETEND
YOU'RE A NANNY.

24:30.230 --> 24:31.766
THE AGENCY DOES DO
EXTENSIVE SECURITY CHECKS

24:31.800 --> 24:33.028
ON WHO THEY HIRE.

24:33.070 --> 24:36.699
BUT NOT NECESSARILY
ON THE PARENTS

24:36.740 --> 24:37.866
WHO HIRE THEM.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.138
COME ON, BUDDY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

24:39.170 --> 24:40.933
DO A LITTLE CAMEO
ON MY TWO DADS?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.231
THAT SHOW WAS CANCELED
FOR A REASON, SHAWN.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.474
I'M SORRY.

24:43.510 --> 24:46.001
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
SOMEONE ELSE TO CO-PARENT WITH.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.688
I WAS GONNA LET YOU BE
GREG EVIGAN.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.918
I JUST THINK THAT STARTEK
SECURITY IS A DEAD END--

24:56.960 --> 24:58.621
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. FINE.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.287
WHAT IF I GO INVESTIGATE
A DIFFERENT--

25:00.330 --> 25:05.097
YES. I KNOW THAT YOU
ARE LEAD DETECTIVE, LASSITER.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.928
OH, GOING THROUGH A TUNNEL.

25:07.970 --> 25:10.632
GOTTA GO.

25:11.740 --> 25:12.729
WHOA.

25:12.770 --> 25:13.839
PLEASE LET ME
EAT MY FRUSTRATION

25:13.880 --> 25:14.699
IN PEACE, SHAWN.

25:14.740 --> 25:17.573
THERE'S THIS DARK CLOUD
SURROUNDING YOU.

25:17.610 --> 25:19.749
IT'S STARVING YOUR CHI.
YEAH.

25:19.780 --> 25:21.839
AND DOWN AT THE STATION,
I CAN SEE A RACCOON

25:21.880 --> 25:23.586
WITH DARK CIRCLES
UNDER HIS EYES.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.542
NO--HER EYES.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.739
OH, GOD.
IT'S THE CHIEF.

25:26.790 --> 25:28.712
CHIEF VICK
IS BECOMING CHIEF COON.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.159
AND SHE'S--SHE'S LASHING OUT
AT EVERYONE.

25:30.190 --> 25:32.158
THAT'S TRUE.
ESPECIALLY LASSIE.

25:32.190 --> 25:34.158
WHO IN TURN IS TAKING
HIS FRUSTRATIONS OUT ON YOU.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.690
LOOK, JULES,

25:35.730 --> 25:38.119
YOU GOTTA TAKE YOUR CHI BACK.
TAKE IT BACK.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.797
AND THAT MEANS
DOING SOMETHING BIG.

25:39.830 --> 25:40.865
SOMETHING RISKY.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.903
SOMETHING THAT'LL HELP YOU BLOW
THIS CASE WIDE OPEN.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.032
* YOU AND I

25:45.070 --> 25:46.833
* IN A LITTLE TOY SHOP

25:46.870 --> 25:48.235
MARRY ME, JULIET.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.305
[applause]

25:50.340 --> 25:52.808
* SET THEM FREE
AT THE BREAK OF DAWN *

25:52.850 --> 25:58.243
* 99 RED BALLOONS GO BY...

25:58.290 --> 26:00.656
WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS
ON FERBERIZING THE BABY?

26:00.690 --> 26:01.759
OH MY GOD. NEVER.

26:01.790 --> 26:02.814
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

26:06.890 --> 26:08.755
DO YOU HAVE ANY REMEDIES
FOR TEETHING PAINS?

26:08.800 --> 26:09.721
TWO VALIUMS.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.819
YOU WOULD GIVE
THE BABY VALIUM?

26:11.870 --> 26:12.825
OH, NO. OF COURSE NOT.

26:12.870 --> 26:15.634
THOSE ARE FOR ME SO I CAN DEAL
WITH THE CRYING.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.092
I JUST GIVE THE BABY
HALF A VALIUM.

26:17.140 --> 26:24.000
*

26:24.050 --> 26:26.803
LOOK, JULES, YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY HAVE TO MARRY ME, OKAY?

26:26.850 --> 26:28.818
JUST--JUST POSE
AS MY WIFE

26:28.850 --> 26:31.739
WHEN WE GO TO THE RED BALLOON
NAN NY AGENCY.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.041
I NEED TO GET A BETTER
PSYCHIC VIBE

26:33.090 --> 26:34.387
ON A COUPLE
OF THEIR NANNIES.

26:34.420 --> 26:35.978
AND YOU NEED A NANNY WHY?

26:36.020 --> 26:37.681
TWO PARTICULAR NANNIES.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.857
I THINK THEY'RE BEHIND
THE ROBBERIES IN THE HEIGHTS.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.357
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THIS STRING

26:41.400 --> 26:42.856
OF HIGH-TECH CAT BURGLARIES--

26:42.900 --> 26:44.765
ONE THAT ENDED IN MURDER--

26:44.800 --> 26:46.768
WERE CAUSED BY A COUPLE
OF 19-YEAR-OLD NANNIES?

26:46.800 --> 26:47.835
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

26:47.870 --> 26:49.667
ONLY ONE OF THEM IS 19.

26:49.700 --> 26:50.837
THE OTHER ONE'S
A SLIGHTLY ZAFTIG,

26:50.870 --> 26:52.337
POLISH NANNY
IN HER THIRTIES.

26:52.370 --> 26:53.803
SHAWN, I CAN'T HELP YOU
DO THIS.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.001
OH NO, NO, NO.
YOU WOULDN'T BE HELPING ME.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.746
I WOULD BE HELPING YOU...

26:57.780 --> 27:00.271
TO SOLVE THE CASE THE WAY
YOU THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED.

27:00.310 --> 27:02.210
JULES,
TO GET YOUR CHI BACK.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.808
INVESTIGATE THESE NANNIES
WITH ME.

27:03.850 --> 27:05.317
OTHERWISE YOUR CHI'S
GOING TO SHRIVEL UP

27:05.350 --> 27:06.385
AND STARVE TO DEATH.

27:06.420 --> 27:09.309
YOU NEED TO FEED
YOUR CHI.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.851
BESIDES, I WASN'T
GOING TO SAY ANYTHING,

27:11.890 --> 27:13.926
BUT I HAD A VISION
OF US BEING MARRIED.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.689
I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY

27:15.730 --> 27:17.391
THIS UNDERCOVER THING
WE'RE GONNA DO,

27:17.430 --> 27:21.332
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A VISION FROM OUR FUTURE.

27:21.370 --> 27:24.862
MR. AND MRS. JULIET SPENCER.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.138
O'HARA?

27:26.170 --> 27:27.364
FINE.

27:27.410 --> 27:28.377
I'LL DO IT.

27:28.410 --> 27:32.369
SHE SAID YES,
EVERYBODY!

27:32.410 --> 27:34.173
SHE LOVES ME SO MUCH!

27:35.720 --> 27:37.312
BUT ONLY FOR DETECTIVE WORK.

27:37.350 --> 27:39.944
I DON'T BUY INTO THIS
WHOLE HUSBAND AND KIDS THING.

27:39.990 --> 27:41.878
MARRIAGE IS JUST
A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION

27:41.920 --> 27:43.410
THAT THE STATE MANDATED
CENTURIES AGO

27:43.460 --> 27:45.325
WHEN WIVES WERE CONSIDERED
PROPERTY.

27:45.360 --> 27:48.090
BUT IF WE ARE GOING
TO PRETEND...

27:48.130 --> 27:49.427
THIS IS WHAT OUR WEDDING
WAS LIKE.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.269
IT'S SUNSET
ON A BEACH IN ANTIGUA...

27:51.300 --> 27:54.428
SO THEN I WALK DOWN THE AISLE
TO AN A CAPPELLA VERSION

27:54.470 --> 27:56.290
OF JAMES TAYLOR'S
"ONLY ONE."

27:56.340 --> 27:57.807
AND BY THIS TIME,
THE FLOWER GIRLS

27:57.840 --> 27:59.205
HAVE TOSSED THE PEONY PETALS

27:59.240 --> 28:01.174
INTO A SOFT,
BUTTERFLYHIEORMATION.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.201
I'LL TAKE YOU IN TO SEE
THE HEAD OF THE AGENCY NOW.

28:06.950 --> 28:08.838
HI, I'M ABBY DANIELS.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.711
AND IT SAYS HERE

28:10.750 --> 28:13.480
THAT YOU ARE
MR. AND MRS. LEVON TOSTIG.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.158
THAT'S CORRECT.
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME

28:15.190 --> 28:16.817
A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT YOUR CHILD.

28:16.860 --> 28:19.988
WELL, WE HAD LITTLE MILLICENT
IN A HOME BIRTH

28:20.030 --> 28:21.019
WITH A DOU LA.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.789
AND AFTERWARDS,

28:22.830 --> 28:24.388
LEVON HERE

28:24.430 --> 28:26.796
BURIED MY PLACENTA
IN THE BACKYARD.

28:26.830 --> 28:27.967
WHOA.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.230
SOME OF OUR NANNIES ARE VERY
ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS.

28:30.270 --> 28:31.999
THEY'RE INTO HOMEOPATHIC
METHODS.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.735
GREAT.
WHAT KIND
OF BACKGROUND CHECKS

28:33.780 --> 28:34.872
DO YOU RUN
ON THESE NANNIES?

28:34.910 --> 28:36.502
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU ASKED THAT,

28:36.540 --> 28:38.007
BECAUSE THE SAFETY
OF YOUR CHILDREN

28:38.050 --> 28:39.074
IS SOMETHING WE PRIDE
OURSELVES ON

28:39.110 --> 28:40.270
HERE AT RED BALLOON.

28:40.310 --> 28:42.119
I LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.

28:42.150 --> 28:44.289
WELL, WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU
A LITTLE BIT AROUND OUR OFFICES.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.810
AND YOU CAN SEE
SOME OF THE SERVICES

28:45.850 --> 28:46.987
THAT WE OFFER HERE.

28:47.020 --> 28:48.954
GREAT.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.129
SO GETTING ANY PSYCHIC
VIBRATIONS

28:51.160 --> 28:53.219
ON YOUR TWO SUSPECT S YET,
LEVON?

28:53.260 --> 28:55.854
I THINK I GOT THROWN OFF
PICTURING YOUR PLACENTA.

28:55.900 --> 28:59.893
NOW THIS IS STEVE HITCHCOCK.

28:59.930 --> 29:02.865
HE'S IN CHARGE OF THE BABY
BONDING CAMERAS WE INSTALL.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.401
PART OF EVERY
NANNY PLACEMENT PACKAGE.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.101
WHAT ARE BABY
BONDING CAMERAS?

29:06.140 --> 29:08.074
WELL, THEY'RE A SERIES
OF WEB CAMS

29:08.110 --> 29:09.407
WE SET UP IN YOUR HOME.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.907
YOU CAN LOG ON
ANY TIME DURING THE DAY

29:10.950 --> 29:13.839
AND SEE HOW YOUR CHILD
AND THE NANNY ARE DOING.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.416
SO YOU'RE SPYING ON THEM.

29:15.450 --> 29:16.974
OH, NO. NOT AT ALL.

29:17.020 --> 29:19.215
THE NAN NIES ARE AWARE
THESE CAMERAS ARE INSTALLED.

29:19.250 --> 29:22.048
IT'S MORE TO KEEP IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR CHILD.

29:22.090 --> 29:23.489
NOT TO MENTION
HAVING THE NANNY KNOW

29:23.520 --> 29:25.556
YOU MAY BE WATCHING HER
AT ANY TIME,

29:25.590 --> 29:27.956
IT ENCOURAGES HER
TO BE EXTRA RESPONSIBLE.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.524
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONES
WITH THE ACCESS

29:29.560 --> 29:31.289
TO THE CAMERA FEED.

29:31.330 --> 29:33.059
YOU SIGN ONTO THE WEB SITE
USING A UNIQUE PASSWORD

29:33.100 --> 29:34.237
ONLY YOU KNOW.

29:34.270 --> 29:36.534
(Abby)
SO YOU CAN SEE,
NOT ONLY DO WE RUN

29:36.570 --> 29:38.003
EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND
CHECKS ON OUR NANNIES,

29:38.040 --> 29:39.530
YOU CAN CHECK ON THEM
WHENEVER YOU LIKE.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.003
[cell phone ringing]
OOH, UH, SWEETIE,

29:41.040 --> 29:42.507
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM
HOW WE DECORATED

29:42.540 --> 29:44.041
LITTLE MILLIE'S ROOM,

29:44.080 --> 29:45.502
THEN THEY'LL KNOW
HOW TO SET UP THE CAMERAS.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.074
EXCUSE ME.

29:47.110 --> 29:51.240
WELL, WE DECORATED WITH
A RASPBERRY AND SAGE THEME.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.917
AND THEN WE DID
THIS PINSTRIPE WALLPAPER

29:52.950 --> 29:54.850
THAT REALLY ACCENTED

29:54.890 --> 29:55.959
THE SEA FOAM GREEN
THAT WE HAD DONE

29:55.990 --> 29:57.059
IN THE CROWN MOLDING.

29:58.523 --> 30:15.210
PERFECT TIMING, GUS.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.599
A NANNY WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO AFFORD COACH SUNGLASSES,

30:17.640 --> 30:18.902
AM I RIGHT?

30:23.420 --> 30:24.944
OF COURSE, I LOVE
WHAT NATE BERKUS DID

30:24.990 --> 30:26.218
ON OPRAH'S
NURSERY THEME WEEK.

30:26.250 --> 30:28.184
SO I TOOK HIS IDEA AND I DID
THE LONG, FLOWING CURTAINS.

30:28.220 --> 30:29.915
BUT ONLY ON TWO
OF THE WINDOWS,

30:29.960 --> 30:31.052
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S FOUR--

30:31.090 --> 30:33.320
HON, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.850
GREAT!

30:34.900 --> 30:36.094
WELL, IF YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS,

30:36.130 --> 30:37.859
YOU JUST LET US KNOW.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.094
THANK YOU. I WILL.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.290
OR E-MAIL.
E-MAIL IS GOOD TOO.

30:40.330 --> 30:42.230
OKAY.
OKAY.

30:42.270 --> 30:45.034
[cell phone ringing]
O'HARA.

30:45.070 --> 30:46.560
UH-HUH. WHERE?

30:48.210 --> 30:49.302
OKAY, I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

30:49.340 --> 30:50.375
THAT WAS LASSITER.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.139
WANTS ME TO MEET HIM
AT SOME EXOTIC REPTILE SHOP

30:52.180 --> 30:53.101
ON CENTRAL.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.015
SAID THEY FOUND
SOME OF THE STOLEN MERCHANDISE

30:55.050 --> 30:56.017
FROM THE ROBBERIES.

30:56.050 --> 30:57.176
OOH. CAN I COME?

30:57.220 --> 30:58.141
I'D LOVE TO SEE
WHAT MY WIFE DOES

30:58.190 --> 30:59.179
AT WORK ALL DAY.

31:01.190 --> 31:03.181
AND THEN BEFORE
EVERY NAP TIME,

31:03.220 --> 31:05.222
WE READ GOOD NIGHT MOON
AND THE GIVING TREE.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.899
THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE BOOKS.

31:07.930 --> 31:09.352
AND THEN SHE LIES DOWN
FOR A 45-MINUTE NAP,

31:09.400 --> 31:11.220
WHICH I KEEP TRACK OF
IN MY CLIENT SLEEP CHART.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.489
I LOVE CHARTS.
WHEN CAN YOU START?

31:17.440 --> 31:19.408
(Lassiter)
ALL RIGHT, WHEN'D THE ITEMS
COME IN?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.135
(man)
JEEZ LOUISE.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.101
DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I KEEP RECORDS

31:22.140 --> 31:23.107
IN QUICKEN IN HERE?

31:23.140 --> 31:24.971
MAYBE TUESDAY.

31:25.010 --> 31:26.102
CAN YOU AT LEAST
DESCRIBE THE PERSON

31:26.150 --> 31:27.447
WHO SOLD THEM TO YOU?

31:27.480 --> 31:29.641
YOU GET USED TO LOOKIN'
AT LIZARDS ALL DAY,

31:29.680 --> 31:32.114
PEOPLE ALL START
TO LOOK ALIKE.

31:32.150 --> 31:33.913
WAS IT A MAN
OR A WOMAN?

31:33.960 --> 31:36.110
BOY, YOU ASK
SOME TOUGHIES.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.151
I THINK IT WAS A GUY.

31:38.190 --> 31:39.589
PASTY WHITE GUY?
BEATNIK HAIRCUT.

31:39.630 --> 31:40.585
STUPID GRIN?

31:40.630 --> 31:42.222
I DON'T THINK SO.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.235
WAS HE ROLY-POLY
LIKE A PUFFER FISH?

31:50.270 --> 31:51.532
SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL?

31:51.570 --> 31:53.265
YEAH. YEAH, HE WAS.

31:53.310 --> 31:54.607
NOW I'M SEEING RED.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.507
WAS HE RED-FACED
LIKE A KOI FISH?

31:57.540 --> 31:59.098
EXACTLY.

31:59.150 --> 32:01.015
AND DID HE SPIT A LOT

32:01.050 --> 32:02.142
LIKE A KOMODO DRAGON?

32:02.180 --> 32:04.080
JUST LIKE A KOMODO.
GREAT!

32:04.120 --> 32:06.042
I'LL TAKE THIS DESCRIPTION
DOWN TO OUR SKETCH ARTIST

32:06.090 --> 32:07.387
AT THE AQUARIUM.

32:07.420 --> 32:08.717
ALL RIGHT, TELL ME EXACTLY
WHICH ITEMS

32:08.760 --> 32:10.182
THIS FISH MAN SOLD.

32:10.220 --> 32:11.653
YOUR VISION KINDA SOUNDS
LIKE THAT RED-FACED GUY

32:11.690 --> 32:13.453
FROM THE RED BALLOON
NAN NY AGENCY--STEVE.

32:13.490 --> 32:14.718
I WAS THINKING
THE KOOL-AID GUY.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.296
BUT YOURS PROBABLY MAKES
MORE SENSE.
YEAH.

32:16.330 --> 32:17.649
I'M GOING TO HEAD
BACK DOWN TO THE STATION,

32:17.700 --> 32:18.667
INVESTIGATE THEM
A LITTLE MORE.

32:18.700 --> 32:19.598
SEE IF I CAN GET A WARRANT.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.530
SO IT'S NOT THE NANNIES
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE

32:21.570 --> 32:22.969
FOR THE BURGLARIES.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.206
[whispers]
IT'S THE AGENCY.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.707
[whispers]
YEAH.

32:25.740 --> 32:30.029
[cell phone ringing]

32:30.080 --> 32:31.274
GUS, I'M SO GLAD
YOU CALLED.

32:31.310 --> 32:32.971
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE
A LOT GLADDER.

32:33.010 --> 32:35.012
CHIEF VICK HAS OFFICIALLY
FORGIVEN US.

32:35.050 --> 32:36.210
I JUST FOUND HER A NANNY.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.274
OH, THAT'S PERFECT.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.208
I THINK I JUST FIGURED OUT
WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.559
THE BEST PART IS,
SHE CAN START RIGHT AWAY.

32:41.590 --> 32:43.285
HER SECURITY CHECK
IS ALREADY DONE,

32:43.320 --> 32:45.288
BECAUSE SHE WORKS
FOR THE BEST AGENCY IN TOWN.

32:45.330 --> 32:48.094
OH, NO.
PLEASE DON'T SAY THE...

32:48.130 --> 32:51.122
RED BALLOON NANNY AGENCY.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.162
[phone slaps shut]

32:56.240 --> 32:57.662
THIS IS THE PART I HATE.
WAITING FOR WARRANTS.

32:57.700 --> 32:59.065
OH, WE'RE NOT WAITING
FOR WARRANTS.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.361
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?

33:00.410 --> 33:02.105
LOOK, GUS, WE KNOW
THE Ws OF THE CRIME.

33:02.140 --> 33:03.437
WE KNOW THE WHO,
WE KNOW THE WHERE.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.175
WE'RE PRETTY SOLID
ON THE WHEREOF.

33:05.210 --> 33:07.007
WE'RE PRETTY SURE
OF THE WHERETOFOR.

33:07.050 --> 33:08.779
WE'RE SCRATCH
ON THE WHATCHAMACALLIT,
SHAWN.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.276
'CAUSE THAT'S
SELF-EXPLANATORY.
SHAWN.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.446
WE DON'T HAVE THE HOW.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.639
WHY DO WE NEED
TO KNOW THE HOW

33:12.690 --> 33:14.112
IF THE GUY'S GONNA BE
ARRESTED?

33:14.160 --> 33:15.218
[exhales]

33:15.260 --> 33:18.752
DUDE, I'M THE ONE THAT HAS
TO DO THE WRAP-UP, REMEMBER?

33:18.790 --> 33:19.552
YOU WANT ME TO GET UP THERE

33:19.590 --> 33:21.490
WITH EGGS BENEDICT
ALL OVER MY FACE?

33:21.530 --> 33:23.020
THE CANADIAN BACON
IN MY HAIR?

33:23.060 --> 33:25.369
HOLLANDAISE DRIPPING DOWN?

33:25.400 --> 33:27.129
I NEED ZING.

33:27.170 --> 33:30.196
I'M A PSYCHIC.
I GOTTA SEE EVERYTHING.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.366
COME ON.

33:36.310 --> 33:38.301
OH, HI, LEVON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:38.350 --> 33:40.341
THIS IS SHMUEL COEN.

33:40.380 --> 33:42.177
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND
AND GODFATHER

33:42.220 --> 33:43.016
TO MY LITTLE MILLICENT.

33:43.050 --> 33:44.540
NOW HE'S, UH,
VERY OVERPROTECT IVE

33:44.590 --> 33:46.808
AND HE INSISTED ON COMING BY
AND GETTING A FEEL

33:46.850 --> 33:48.215
FOR THE FOLKS
THAT ARE GOING TO BE CARING

33:48.260 --> 33:49.488
FOR HIS LITTLE
GODDAUGHTER.

33:49.520 --> 33:50.487
OH, WELL, GUYS,
I'M SO SORRY.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.828
BUT STEVE AND ABBY,

33:51.860 --> 33:54.021
THEY'RE OUT DOING
HOME INTERVIEWS WITH CLIENTS.

33:55.260 --> 33:56.488
YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE'RE OKAY WITH WAITING.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.773
DUDE, SHE HAS
A HEADACHE.

34:09.810 --> 34:13.109
START WHISTLING SOMETHING
BY PHILIP GLASS.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.471
[shrill, high-pitched
whistling]

34:15.520 --> 34:17.249
[hawking up phlegm]

34:17.280 --> 34:19.544
[whistling and hawking
continues]

34:22.220 --> 34:24.450
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?

34:24.490 --> 34:25.752
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT
OUT HERE.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.155
YOU KNOW, I BET
YOU'D BE MORE COMFY

34:27.190 --> 34:28.589
IN MRS. DANIEL'S OFFICE.

34:28.630 --> 34:29.699
YOU SURE IT'S NO TROUBLE?

34:29.730 --> 34:31.322
NO, NO. NOT AT ALL.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.621
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS, RIGHT?

34:32.670 --> 34:34.297
THANK YOU.

34:34.340 --> 34:38.231
[whistling continues]

34:38.270 --> 34:39.498
WHAT KIND OF CLUES
ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

34:39.540 --> 34:40.564
ANY KIND.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.474
SOMEBODY CHEWS TOBACCO.

34:44.510 --> 34:47.775
HOW ABOUT SOME NEW CLUES?

34:54.360 --> 34:56.783
[pats wall]

34:56.820 --> 34:58.287
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:58.330 --> 34:59.683
DUDE, I THINK THIS THING
OPENS UP.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.721
SCRATCHES ON BOTH SIDES
OF THE WALL.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.751
IT'S, LIKE, A SECRET DOOR
OR SOMETHING.

35:13.470 --> 35:14.437
WOW.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.209
NICELY DONE, GUS.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.549
THESE ARE FEEDS
FROM THE BABY BONDING CAMERAS

35:18.580 --> 35:20.343
THAT THE AGENCY INSTALLS.

35:20.380 --> 35:21.517
IT'S KIND OF CREEPY.

35:21.550 --> 35:22.915
YEAH, ESPECIALLY SINCE
THE ONLY ONES

35:22.950 --> 35:25.180
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE
TO ACCESS THESE FEEDS

35:25.220 --> 35:26.209
ARE THE PARENTS THEMSELVES.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.615
THIS IS OUR PROOF, SHAWN.

35:27.650 --> 35:29.254
THEY WATCH THE FOOTAGE
FROM THE CAMERAS,

35:29.290 --> 35:30.211
GET THE SECURITY CODES,

35:30.260 --> 35:32.228
SEE WHERE PEOPLE
ARE HIDING THEIR VALUABLES,

35:32.260 --> 35:33.249
AND CASE OUT THEIR HOUSES.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.393
WE GOT IT, SHAWN.
LET'S GO.

35:34.430 --> 35:36.398
WHOA!
WHAT?

35:36.430 --> 35:38.489
NO, THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

35:38.530 --> 35:39.667
NONE OF THE HOUSES
THAT GOT ROBBED

35:39.700 --> 35:41.292
HAD NANNIES
WORKING IN THEM.

35:50.810 --> 35:52.778
DUDE, IT WASN'T THE HOUSES
WITH THE NANNIES.

35:52.810 --> 35:54.573
IT WAS THE HOUSES
NEXT DOOR.

35:56.350 --> 35:58.181
JULIET'S GONNA HAVE A HARD
TIME SERVING THE WARRANT

35:58.220 --> 35:59.141
HERE AT THE RED BALLOON,

35:59.190 --> 36:01.784
WHEN THE PERSON SHE'S TRYING
TO ARREST

36:01.820 --> 36:03.879
IS SITTING IN CHIEF VICK'S
LIVING ROOM!

36:07.430 --> 36:09.557
(Shawn)
SWEET BLACK LICORICE.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.919
I'VE GOT THE HOW.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.894
I'VE GOT TO GET JULES
ON THE PHONE RIGHT AWAY.

36:12.930 --> 36:14.966
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE HERE!

36:15.000 --> 36:16.934
JULES, IT'S SHAWN.

36:16.970 --> 36:18.608
FIRST OF ALL,
HOW ARE YOU?

36:18.640 --> 36:20.301
OH, THAT SOUNDS NICE.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.501
SECONDLY, MEET ME
AT CHIEF VICK'S HOUSE PRONTO.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.599
I'VE HAD A BIG VISION.
TOP SEVEN OF ALL TIME.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.742
LET'S GO.

36:33.350 --> 36:36.319
(Shawn)
THANKS FOR GETTING HERE
SO QUICKLY, GUYS.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.452
WHERE'S YOUR BABY GIFT?

36:37.490 --> 36:38.320
A WHAT?

36:38.360 --> 36:39.850
THE BABY GIFT.

36:39.890 --> 36:41.551
LASSIE, WE'RE ABOUT
TO ENTER THE CHIEF'S HOME.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.953
YOU CAN'T JUST BARGE IN,
GUNS A BLAZING.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.467
THIS IS DELICATE.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.367
THE SUSPECT COULD BE HOLDING
CHIEF VICK'S BABY.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.731
OR WE COULD MAKE
CHIEF VICK VERY, VERY ANGRY.

36:48.770 --> 36:49.896
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.408
NOBODY WANTS THAT.

36:55.440 --> 36:59.274
[knocking at door]

36:59.310 --> 37:00.572
PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
GIVEN YOU THIS SOONER,

37:00.610 --> 37:02.578
BUT, UH,
HAPPY BABY GIFT.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.542
UH, THANK YOU.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.716
IT'S A MINI RATTLE

37:05.750 --> 37:07.786
AND ALSO A LOW CALORIE
BREATH FRESHENER.

37:07.820 --> 37:10.516
OH, GREAT. IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU GUYS?

37:10.560 --> 37:12.027
WE JUST WANTED TO SAY HI.

37:12.060 --> 37:14.426
OH, OKAY.

37:14.460 --> 37:18.021
OH, UH, SHAWN,
I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE.

37:18.060 --> 37:19.721
I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR SNAPPING AT YOU

37:19.770 --> 37:20.828
THE OTHER DAY.

37:20.870 --> 37:22.565
CHIEF, THERE'S NO NEED.
REALLY.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.737
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST SO MAD,

37:23.770 --> 37:24.998
I JUST WANTED
TO STRANGLE YOU.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.008
BUT I ADMIT I WAS WRONG.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.439
I REALIZED I WAS OVERREACTING

37:28.480 --> 37:29.629
AFTER I TRIED TO RUN
MY HUSBAND OVER

37:29.680 --> 37:31.443
AFTER HE LEFT
THE GARAGE DOOR OPEN.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.845
BUT THIS AGENCY

37:32.880 --> 37:34.313
THAT YOU AND GUS FOUND...

37:34.350 --> 37:35.749
YEAH, ABOUT--
(Steve)
MRS. VICK!

37:35.780 --> 37:36.872
YEAH.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.512
I JUST FINISHED UP
INSTALLING THE CAMERAS.

37:39.650 --> 37:41.288
OH.

37:42.090 --> 37:44.388
GUESS WHO JUST
FELL ASLEEP?

37:44.430 --> 37:45.852
IRIS IS SLEEPING?

37:45.890 --> 37:47.528
LIKE A LAMB.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.424
PLEASE TELL ME
THAT YOUR OTHER NANNIES

37:48.460 --> 37:49.996
ARE AS GOOD WITH CHILDREN
AS YOU ARE.

37:50.030 --> 37:51.395
EVEN BETTER.

37:51.430 --> 37:54.490
YOU GUYS DID A GREAT JOB.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.030
YEAH. ABOUT THAT...

37:56.070 --> 37:57.492
MR. AND MRS. TOSTIG.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.667
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU KNEW MRS. VICK.

37:59.710 --> 38:01.530
SHH.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.775
MR. SOFTY WOULD LIKE
TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

38:05.710 --> 38:07.541
OH, SHAWN,
I REALLY DON'T THINK

38:07.580 --> 38:08.945
THAT THIS IS THE TIME.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.345
I THOUGHT HIS NAME
WAS LEVON.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.445
WHAT'S THAT?

38:13.490 --> 38:14.457
THE BEAR SNORES
REALLY LOUD,

38:14.490 --> 38:16.549
HE'S PRETTY SURE
THE TURTLE'S REALLY AN ALIEN,

38:16.590 --> 38:19.024
AND ALL THE MONKEY WANTS TO DO
IS PLAY PULL MY FINGER.

38:19.060 --> 38:21.620
OH AND SOMEBODY JUST PUT IN
SOME VIDEO CAMERAS?

38:21.660 --> 38:24.094
YEAH, I JUST SET UP
A BUNCH OF THEM. SO?

38:24.130 --> 38:25.688
WELL, THEY'RE NOT
NORMAL VIDEO CAMERAS.

38:25.730 --> 38:28.597
THEY'RE ALL HIGH-TECHY
WITH ARMY-GRADE RESOLUTION.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.767
WHAT? WHAT'S THAT, FELLA?

38:30.800 --> 38:33.337
LOOK UP?

38:33.370 --> 38:34.871
THAT'S JUST A FAN,
SILLY.

38:37.580 --> 38:38.774
OH.

38:38.810 --> 38:40.448
LASSIE, WHAT'S THAT?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.639
THIS IS THE EXTELLA 5400.

38:46.690 --> 38:48.851
THEY'RE THE BABY BONDING
CAMERAS,

38:48.890 --> 38:49.788
SO YOU CAN CHECK IN.

38:49.820 --> 38:53.483
THE EXTELLA 5400
RETAILS FOR OVER $10,000.

38:53.530 --> 38:54.656
OW. [winces]

38:54.700 --> 38:55.689
I'M FINE.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.095
I'M SEEING ANGLES
AND PIVOTS AND DIVOTS.

38:59.130 --> 39:00.768
WELL, NO DIVOTS.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.665
BUT IT SURE IS FUN TO SAY
THOSE BACK-TO-BACK.

39:02.700 --> 39:04.463
PIVOTS AND DIVOTS
AND PIVOTS AND DIVOTS

39:04.510 --> 39:05.636
AND PIVOTS AND DIVOTS
AND--
SHAWN.

39:05.670 --> 39:06.705
WHO WANTS
TO GIVE THAT A SHOT?

39:06.740 --> 39:08.105
GIVE WHAT A SHOT?

39:08.140 --> 39:09.607
SHOTS. THAT'S IT. EXACTLY.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.107
BUT I DON'T SEE
ANY SHOTS OF NANNIES

39:11.140 --> 39:12.641
PLAYING WITH BABIES.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.704
IN FACT, THERE'S NO BABIES
AT ALL.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.718
I'M SEEING JEWELRY BOXES
AND SAFES

39:15.750 --> 39:18.048
AND ENTRANCES AND EXITS
AND SECURITY KEYPADS.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.547
BUT--BUT FROM WHERE?

39:23.090 --> 39:25.581
FROM THE HOUSES NEXT DOOR.

39:25.630 --> 39:26.881
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:26.930 --> 39:28.955
[baby stirring]

39:30.200 --> 39:34.534
[whispering]
SHH! THERE'S A BABY SLEEPING.

39:34.570 --> 39:35.594
I'M TALKING ABOUT--

39:35.640 --> 39:37.631
[toys squealing]

39:37.670 --> 39:38.602
[everyone hushing Shawn]

39:38.640 --> 39:41.063
SHAWN, WILL YOU STOP!

39:41.110 --> 39:42.634
SHH!

39:42.680 --> 39:44.477
[whispering]
WELL, IT'S LIKE
A MINE FIELD!

39:46.550 --> 39:48.518
[clears throat]

39:48.550 --> 39:50.541
I'M TALKING ABOUT
CASING OUT HOUSES

39:50.580 --> 39:52.548
NEXT DOOR TO THE ONES
YOUR NANNIES WORK AT.

39:52.590 --> 39:55.013
I'M TALKING ABOUT
A STRING OF ROBBERIES,

39:55.060 --> 39:56.618
ONE OF WHICH WENT
TERRIBLY WRONG,

39:56.660 --> 39:58.821
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOUR WITNESS-LESS CRIME

39:58.860 --> 40:00.555
GOT WITNESSED.

40:00.590 --> 40:01.989
AND THEN IT BECAME MURDER.

40:02.030 --> 40:03.793
[whispering]
THAT RIDICULOUS.

40:03.830 --> 40:05.866
IS IT AS RIDICULOUS
AS HAVING A SECRET PANEL

40:05.900 --> 40:07.561
IN YOUR OFFICE
WHERE YOU CAN PLAN

40:07.600 --> 40:09.067
ALL YOUR ROBBERIES?

40:09.100 --> 40:10.931
YOU HAD ACCESS
TO EACH AND EVERY ONE

40:10.970 --> 40:12.107
OF THOSE BABY BONDING CAMERAS,

40:12.140 --> 40:13.505
AND YOU MANIPULATED THEM.

40:13.540 --> 40:14.575
NOT TO CHECK ON ANY NANNIES,

40:14.610 --> 40:15.929
BUT TO CASE THE HOUSES
NEXT DOOR

40:15.980 --> 40:18.130
TO CAPTURE SECURITY ALARM CODES

40:18.180 --> 40:21.638
SO YOU COULD BREAK INTO
THOSE HOUSES UNDETECTED.

40:21.680 --> 40:25.081
I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY
RIDICULOUS.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.486
THOUGH NOT AS RIDICULOUS
AS DENISE RICHARDS

40:27.520 --> 40:28.589
PLAYING A NUCLEAR PHYSICIST

40:28.620 --> 40:30.508
NAMED CHRISTMAS JONES
IN A BOND MOVIE.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.882
BUT STILL.

40:33.930 --> 40:35.818
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS GUY'S DEAL IS,

40:35.860 --> 40:37.657
BUT WE GOTTA GO.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.793
THIS GUY'S DEAL
IS THAT HE'S A PSYCHIC.

40:39.830 --> 40:42.469
WHO HAPPENS TO WORK
FOR THE POLICE.

40:42.500 --> 40:43.694
OH, REALLY?

40:43.740 --> 40:45.059
[whispering]
YEAH, REALLY.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.964
THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT,

40:47.010 --> 40:49.570
WHICH I'M THE CHIEF OF.

40:49.610 --> 40:50.736
[handcuffs clinking]

40:55.850 --> 40:58.171
[normal level voice]
ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU
YOU LOOK LIKE A PUFFER FISH?

40:58.220 --> 41:00.609
[baby crying]

41:03.620 --> 41:06.623
SORRY.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.097
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

41:10.130 --> 41:11.119
I KNOW.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.025
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS GET
THE FRUIT BOWL ASSORTMENT

41:13.070 --> 41:14.662
FROM GARRETT BELL'S
JELLYBEAN FACTORY

41:14.700 --> 41:16.065
AND EVERY FLAVOR'S
DELICIOUS.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.590
I'M TALKING ABOUT
WITH CHIEF VICK.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.005
HER NEPHEW'S TRANSFERRING
TO A NURSING SCHOOL

41:19.040 --> 41:20.530
IN SANTA BARBARA.

41:20.570 --> 41:21.935
IN TWO WEEKS,
SHE'LL HAVE HER OLD NANNY BACK.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.629
MM, POMEGRANATE.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.102
I WONDER WHAT SHE'S GOING
TO DO IN THE MEANTIME.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.879
OH, I TOOK CARE OF THAT.

41:26.910 --> 41:28.070
YOU MEAN, AFTER I SCOURED
THE CITY

41:28.110 --> 41:29.611
AND COULDN'T FIND ANYONE,

41:29.650 --> 41:31.072
YOU JUST STUMBLED
UPON A NANNY RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH

41:31.120 --> 41:33.111
FOR CHIEF VICK?
THAT I DID.

41:35.090 --> 41:37.809
GIVE ME A LITTLE WHOOP.
WHOOP.

41:40.660 --> 41:41.991
AND YOU GOTTA ADMIT--

41:42.030 --> 41:44.089
THE MAN KNOWS HOW
TO WORK A BABY.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.999
SHAWN!

41:47.030 --> 41:49.032
DON'T LOOK BACK.
JUST KEEP WALKING.

41:49.070 --> 41:50.094
SHAWN! SHAWN!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

41:50.140 --> 41:52.631

41:53.910 --> 41:55.639

41:56.880 --> 41:59.769
COMING OUT OF THIS THING!

41:59.810 --> 42:02.779
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

42:02.820 --> 42:06.642
*

42:06.690 --> 42:07.941
* IN BETWEEN THE LINES

42:07.990 --> 42:10.208
* THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY

42:10.260 --> 42:13.957
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

42:13.990 --> 42:15.298
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

42:15.330 --> 42:17.025
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

42:17.060 --> 42:21.895
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

42:21.940 --> 42:25.899
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

42:25.940 --> 42:27.965
*

42:28.010 --> 42:29.637
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:29.680 --> 42:31.671
* THAT I'M NOT
TELLING THE TRUTH *

42:31.710 --> 42:32.972
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:33.010 --> 42:34.819
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

42:34.850 --> 42:36.044
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

42:36.080 --> 42:37.945
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

42:37.980 --> 42:39.345
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

42:39.390 --> 42:41.984
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

42:42.020 --> 42:43.749
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:43.790 --> 42:45.587
