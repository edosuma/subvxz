WEBVTT

00:00.652 --> 00:02.019
Congratulations.

00:02.087 --> 00:04.006
You've been selected for
an elite operations unit.

00:04.123 --> 00:07.325
With your permission,
we'd like to conduct a test

00:07.392 --> 00:09.493
to determine your suitability
for service.

00:09.561 --> 00:12.196
Sure. You mind me asking
what you're testing me for?

00:12.264 --> 00:13.731
Just relax.

00:13.799 --> 00:16.634
We have a short training video
that will explain everything.

00:19.938 --> 00:21.339
Wait.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

00:30.449 --> 00:32.383
Are you okay, Chuck?

00:32.451 --> 00:33.384
Huh?

00:33.452 --> 00:35.820
Oh, um... no, no.

00:35.888 --> 00:38.756
Not since Emmett started playing
romantic comedies 24/7.

00:38.824 --> 00:40.458
He must love
<i>Must Love Dogs,</i>

00:40.525 --> 00:41.659
'cause that's
always playing.

00:41.727 --> 00:42.927
Right.

00:42.995 --> 00:44.629
Well, I was just
wondering about tonight.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.130
Oh, is there a mission tonight?

00:46.198 --> 00:48.366
Actually, I
was referring

00:48.433 --> 00:50.067
to the whole
Valentine's Day thing.

00:50.135 --> 00:51.736
Oh, my gosh, right.

00:51.803 --> 00:53.504
I'm so sorry--
did you want to do something?

00:53.572 --> 00:55.239
No, no, I was just curious.

00:55.307 --> 00:56.974
Unless <i>you</i> wanted
to do something?

00:57.042 --> 01:00.278
Doesn't it seem like we ought
to do something?

01:00.345 --> 01:01.846
I mean, it's up to you.
- Yeah, sure.

01:01.914 --> 01:03.314
Okay, I mean, we have
been cover dating

01:03.382 --> 01:04.982
for over a year now, right?

01:05.050 --> 01:07.051
Yeah, I mean, it would be weird
if we didn't do something.

01:07.119 --> 01:08.085
Completely weird.

01:11.924 --> 01:14.558
Maybe we could give our covers
the night off.

01:14.626 --> 01:16.193
I have a bunch of paperwork
to catch up on anyway.

01:16.261 --> 01:17.595
Good.
Great.

01:17.663 --> 01:19.297
Hey, hey, hey,
happy Valentine's Day, you two.

01:19.364 --> 01:20.765
Any hot plans for today?

01:22.901 --> 01:24.936
Absolutely, there is.

01:27.272 --> 01:28.539
My house at 8:00, right?

01:29.741 --> 01:30.908
I can hardly wait.

01:30.976 --> 01:32.143
I'll see you
then, sweetie.

01:32.210 --> 01:33.244
Oh, okay.

01:33.312 --> 01:35.012
Bye.

01:37.382 --> 01:39.216
Did you ever think
that the two of us

01:39.284 --> 01:40.651
would wind up with
smart, beautiful,

01:40.719 --> 01:42.520
sexually adventuresome
girls on Valentine's Day?

01:42.587 --> 01:43.888
The answer is no.

01:43.956 --> 01:45.256
Two jackasses
like you

01:45.324 --> 01:47.558
landing two hot pieces
like Anna and Blondie?

01:47.626 --> 01:49.393
It's a cruel
trick of nature.

01:49.461 --> 01:50.962
Grimes! Get your butt
to the sales floor

01:51.029 --> 01:52.463
before I kick it over there.

01:52.531 --> 01:53.764
Bartowski,

01:53.832 --> 01:55.232
herd up your nerds.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.834
They're right...
they're right there.

01:58.036 --> 01:59.303
And you two dimwits,

01:59.371 --> 02:00.938
don't leave the cage
until that backlog

02:01.006 --> 02:02.606
of repairs are finished.

02:02.674 --> 02:03.774
And where is Milbarge?

02:03.842 --> 02:05.509
Hello.

02:05.577 --> 02:07.144
Hmm?

02:07.212 --> 02:09.113
I'm sorry I'm late-- I was just
waiting for these to cool.

02:09.181 --> 02:10.648
What the hell
is that?

02:10.716 --> 02:13.317
Oh, well, I put little lips
on the cupcakes for you.

02:13.385 --> 02:14.885
I'm talking about that thing
on your head.

02:14.953 --> 02:16.454
Oh.

02:16.521 --> 02:17.788
Well, Henrietta's in town.

02:17.856 --> 02:18.956
I wanted to look my best.

02:20.759 --> 02:23.027
I mean, it's not that much
of a difference.

02:23.095 --> 02:24.161
Really?

02:24.229 --> 02:26.897
I'll be in my office.

02:26.965 --> 02:30.134
Next time, do your baking
on your own time.

02:32.971 --> 02:35.272
My God, who crapped
in his box of chocolates?

02:39.011 --> 02:40.311
I don't care what it costs!

02:40.379 --> 02:41.912
Get it here tomorrow!

02:43.648 --> 02:44.982
What's he doing in there?

02:45.050 --> 02:48.586
I don't know,
but it's completely unnatural.

02:48.653 --> 02:49.820
Oh, my God.

02:49.888 --> 02:51.188
You don't think that he's...

02:51.256 --> 02:52.890
Working?
Calm down, Morgan.

02:52.958 --> 02:54.025
Yeah, there's
got to be

02:54.092 --> 02:55.393
a rational explanation
for this.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.028
Oh, no, look at him.

02:57.095 --> 02:58.462
The guy's a machine.

02:58.530 --> 03:00.131
I think Morgan's
on to something.

03:00.198 --> 03:01.966
What if it's not
really Big Mike?

03:02.034 --> 03:03.200
What?

03:03.268 --> 03:05.169
Like, a robot sent
from the future?

03:05.237 --> 03:06.737
A cybernetic organism.

03:06.805 --> 03:08.839
A skin job.

03:08.907 --> 03:10.708
There's only one
way to find out.

03:10.776 --> 03:13.377
If he bleeds, he's human.

03:13.445 --> 03:14.645
Guys.

03:14.713 --> 03:16.247
How about I just talk to him?

03:17.716 --> 03:19.016
Please.

03:19.084 --> 03:20.451
Okay, fine.

03:20.519 --> 03:21.685
It's your funeral,
Bartowski.

03:26.825 --> 03:28.125
Let me ask
a question, Bartowski.

03:28.193 --> 03:29.593
What kind of woman

03:29.661 --> 03:31.729
delivers divorce papers
on Valentine's Day?

03:32.931 --> 03:34.165
Your... your wife?

03:34.232 --> 03:35.733
The lady Big Mike is no more.

03:35.801 --> 03:38.135
I'm-I'm so sorry
to hear that, sir.

03:38.203 --> 03:39.904
Damn straight.

03:39.971 --> 03:42.039
I had the catch of a lifetime
and let her get away.

03:43.241 --> 03:44.675
You want to talk about it?

03:44.743 --> 03:46.410
I'll be fine.

03:46.478 --> 03:48.412
Long as I keep working,
I won't have time

03:48.480 --> 03:50.347
to realize I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

03:50.415 --> 03:52.750
alone and unloved.

03:54.086 --> 03:56.053
There is one thing
you can do for me.

03:56.121 --> 03:57.621
Sure.

03:59.224 --> 04:01.358
Tell those imbeciles out there
to get cracking!

04:01.426 --> 04:03.060
'Cause from now on,

04:03.128 --> 04:05.129
it's a whole new Buy More!

04:05.197 --> 04:07.565
Get that damn <i>Must Love Dogs</i>
off the TV.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.682
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

04:24.749 --> 04:26.350
This is the worst
Valentine's Day ever, right?

04:26.418 --> 04:27.852
Come on, don't be silly.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.420
Please, you're not going
to offend me.

04:29.488 --> 04:31.589
There's got
to be someone somewhere

04:31.656 --> 04:33.958
having a far worse
Valentine's Day.

04:34.025 --> 04:37.328
On the night of August 12, 1965,

04:37.395 --> 04:39.263
the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines

04:39.331 --> 04:40.931
endeavored to make
a daring helicopter assault

04:40.999 --> 04:42.633
on the Elephant Valley.

04:46.338 --> 04:47.738
I hope I'm not interrupting.

04:47.806 --> 04:49.073
What can I do for you, General?

04:49.141 --> 04:51.509
LAPD just picked up one of ours.

04:51.576 --> 04:53.577
The agent's name is Jim Yeager.

04:53.645 --> 04:55.079
He's been missing
for over a year,

04:55.147 --> 04:57.781
although he was presumed to be
on a covert domestic assignment.

04:57.849 --> 05:00.384
Unfortunately, we have no record
of this assignment,

05:00.452 --> 05:02.786
and so far,
the subject has been...

05:02.854 --> 05:04.054
uncooperative.

05:04.122 --> 05:05.256
Cat's got his tongue, huh?

05:05.323 --> 05:06.957
You want me
to take a crack at him?

05:08.660 --> 05:11.562
As you can see, his mental state
is fragile enough already.

05:11.630 --> 05:14.565
The subject's last confirmed
location comes from a phone call

05:14.633 --> 05:17.601
traced to this LA cul-de-sac.

05:17.669 --> 05:19.003
Yeager was living
in the Valley?

05:19.070 --> 05:21.672
Huh... no wonder
he went nuts, right?

05:21.740 --> 05:23.507
We took the liberty
of purchasing a home there

05:23.575 --> 05:24.942
to serve as a base
of operations.

05:25.010 --> 05:26.977
Zoom in on that, please.

05:29.714 --> 05:31.315
What's that he keeps saying?

05:31.383 --> 05:32.883
Salamander.

05:32.951 --> 05:35.319
Possible code name
for his enemy contact.

05:35.387 --> 05:37.855
Our best guess:
he chose this location

05:37.923 --> 05:39.890
for its proximity
to a sleeper cell.

05:39.958 --> 05:42.593
I need for someone
to resume Yeager's assignment,

05:42.661 --> 05:44.094
identify his contact

05:44.162 --> 05:45.930
and infiltrate
their terrorist network.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.299
I don't know how well I'd fit in
with those people, General.

05:48.366 --> 05:50.601
Not you, Major Casey.

05:50.669 --> 05:52.336
We need a normal couple.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.974
That Casey?

05:57.042 --> 05:58.175
Looks like we got a mission.

05:58.243 --> 05:59.877
Thank God.

06:03.949 --> 06:06.517
I'm afraid you two are gonna
have to drop your dating cover

06:06.585 --> 06:07.651
for this particular
assignment.

06:07.719 --> 06:09.086
No problem.
- What is it?

06:09.154 --> 06:12.022
Thai street racing gang,
a Ukrainian prostitution ring?

06:12.090 --> 06:13.324
No, for this
mission,

06:13.391 --> 06:16.026
you and Agent Walker
are gonna be married.

06:20.565 --> 06:21.899
You two kids are going
to the suburbs.

06:23.201 --> 06:25.636
Good luck as a
normal couple.

06:43.154 --> 06:44.555
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:44.623 --> 06:47.491
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:47.559 --> 06:49.126
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:49.194 --> 06:50.794
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

06:50.862 --> 06:52.329
# Na-na na-na na-na #

06:52.397 --> 06:55.599
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

07:07.238 --> 07:08.505
No.

07:09.940 --> 07:12.409
Maybe.

07:12.476 --> 07:14.244
Breaking out a
dad shirt, huh?

07:14.311 --> 07:15.378
Yeah.

07:15.446 --> 07:16.679
What do you think?

07:16.747 --> 07:18.681
Well, I think it makes you look
very grown-up.

07:18.749 --> 07:20.650
Oh, good,
that's kind of the idea.

07:20.718 --> 07:21.851
Yeah, where are you guys going?

07:21.919 --> 07:23.386
Uh, Sarah and I
are just house-sitting.

07:23.454 --> 07:25.855
Her boss at the Orange Orange
is out of town, so...

07:25.923 --> 07:27.157
Oh, Chuck, that's...
that's great.

07:27.224 --> 07:28.658
Spending a week in the suburbs?

07:28.726 --> 07:30.393
Yeah, dream come true.

07:30.461 --> 07:31.661
No, don't you get it?

07:31.729 --> 07:33.863
This is... this is like
a dry run, you know,

07:33.931 --> 07:36.666
so you and Sarah can see
what it would really be like.

07:36.734 --> 07:37.734
Zip it! Uh-uh!

07:37.802 --> 07:39.702
That is your wedding craziness

07:39.770 --> 07:41.871
right there, so keep that--
that's yours.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.840
We're just house-sitting--
it's no big deal.

07:43.908 --> 07:46.242
Okay, fine,
can we call it cohabitating

07:46.310 --> 07:48.144
with your long-term girlfriend
in a house

07:48.212 --> 07:52.115
that doesn't have posters that
were hung in the eighth grade?

07:52.183 --> 07:53.249
That-That...

07:53.317 --> 07:55.418
is a collectible,
but yeah, fine.

07:55.486 --> 07:57.020
We can... we can call it that.

07:57.088 --> 07:58.988
Then, that
is a big step forward.

09:21.205 --> 09:21.271
Love what you've done
with the place.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.107
Thanks--
I had help.

09:24.175 --> 09:26.576
Uh, sorry, but whose life
have I stepped into?

09:26.644 --> 09:28.011
What-What...

09:28.078 --> 09:29.112
What are you doing?

09:30.347 --> 09:31.648
What does it look
like I'm doing?

09:31.715 --> 09:32.916
I'm making potato salad.

09:32.983 --> 09:34.717
Are you cooking
for the entire neighborhood?

09:34.785 --> 09:35.919
No, Chuck.

09:35.986 --> 09:38.188
You are.

09:38.255 --> 09:40.023
Hey, there's the
grill-meister!

09:41.225 --> 09:43.159
Welcome, neighbors.

09:43.227 --> 09:44.794
Don't forget,
one of our new neighbors

09:44.862 --> 09:46.095
is a suspected terrorist.

09:48.799 --> 09:49.933
You heard the little lady.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.401
Get out there and mingle.

09:57.575 --> 09:59.342
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

09:59.410 --> 10:01.911
I think that I speak
for all of us when I say

10:01.979 --> 10:04.047
that the only reason that I took
this job at the Buy More

10:04.114 --> 10:07.116
was to do as little work
as humanly possible.

10:07.184 --> 10:09.452
And the big man...
he made that dream a reality.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.988
That man's an inspiration
to slackers everywhere.

10:12.056 --> 10:13.790
Until his old lady
dumped him.

10:13.857 --> 10:15.124
We're screwed...
I mean, we're screwed

10:15.192 --> 10:17.227
now that he has nothing
to live for except for work.

10:17.294 --> 10:20.063
Yeah, but how do we get
Mrs. Big Mike to take him back?

10:20.130 --> 10:21.664
How do you mend
a broken heart?

10:21.732 --> 10:23.600
You mean, how do
we get him laid?

10:23.667 --> 10:27.337
I'm sorry to interrupt this
little meeting of the minds,

10:27.404 --> 10:28.838
but you're not the only ones

10:28.906 --> 10:30.840
who find this new regime
insufferable.

10:30.908 --> 10:32.775
It's obvious that
our rotund leader

10:32.843 --> 10:35.778
is channeling his sexual
energies into the Buy More.

10:35.846 --> 10:37.146
In my opinion,
our only hope...

10:37.214 --> 10:38.982
Is to channel them back
into sex. Yes, brilliant,

10:39.049 --> 10:40.350
Emmett, but where
do we find

10:40.417 --> 10:42.552
Big Mike a ridiculously
out of his league hottie?

10:42.620 --> 10:44.254
Yeah, someone
who will suck his...

10:44.321 --> 10:45.521
will to work out of him.

10:45.589 --> 10:46.756
Not at a Bennigans's bar.

10:46.824 --> 10:49.058
Sometimes, that fruit
hangs a little too low.

10:49.126 --> 10:52.128
Where <i>do</i> you meet people
you don't have to pay for sex?

10:58.135 --> 10:59.702
Welcome to the neighborhood.

10:59.770 --> 11:00.870
Oh...

11:00.938 --> 11:03.039
Hi.
- How you doing?

11:03.107 --> 11:04.674
I'm good. I'm... I...
- Hi. My name is Charles.

11:04.742 --> 11:05.742
Oh, I'm Brad.

11:05.809 --> 11:07.644
I live next door.
There you go.

11:07.711 --> 11:08.745
I'm... I'm so sorry.

11:08.812 --> 11:10.313
I just ran out.

11:10.381 --> 11:12.315
Well, lucky for you,
I'm in the stationery biz.

11:12.383 --> 11:13.549
Check this baby out.

11:13.617 --> 11:16.352
It is 110 pound card stock,
brand-new,

11:16.420 --> 11:17.887
genuine embossing,

11:17.955 --> 11:18.888
antique finish.

11:18.956 --> 11:20.189
Wow.

11:20.257 --> 11:22.392
Listen, don't let
any of these bums know,

11:22.459 --> 11:24.360
but I can get you
a thousand of those at cost.

11:24.428 --> 11:26.329
Enough shoptalk.

11:26.397 --> 11:28.097
Let's go meet some of the
natives. What do you say?

11:28.165 --> 11:29.098
Okay.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.500
Guys, this is Charlie.

11:30.567 --> 11:32.669
Uh, Charlie, over here
we got Mark.

11:32.736 --> 11:34.337
Hi. Hi.
Whatever you do,

11:34.405 --> 11:36.172
do not let him
drive your golf cart.

11:38.242 --> 11:40.109
We got Dennis here.
Uh, Dennis and his wife,

11:40.177 --> 11:42.211
Trudy, every Friday night,

11:42.279 --> 11:43.980
they play a pretty wild
game of charades.

11:44.048 --> 11:45.114
It gets pretty zany.

11:46.383 --> 11:49.152
And this one,
last but least, Mitch.

11:49.219 --> 11:51.087
Do not believe a word
this dog says.

11:53.490 --> 11:54.624
Hold on a minute.

11:54.692 --> 11:56.359
Who is that
talking to my wife?

11:59.363 --> 12:01.264
Oh, that's-that's my wife.

12:01.332 --> 12:02.332
That's Sarah.

12:04.835 --> 12:06.336
Well...

12:06.403 --> 12:08.805
Well done, Charlie.

12:08.872 --> 12:11.040
You want to trade
sometime?

12:15.679 --> 12:17.880
I'm kidding!

12:17.948 --> 12:20.416
No way the PTA
would stand for that.

12:20.484 --> 12:21.718
All right, all right.

12:21.785 --> 12:23.052
Just a few more details
and you will be ready

12:23.120 --> 12:24.954
to mingle with the singles.

12:25.022 --> 12:26.856
Who the hell is this
Lando Calrissian?

12:26.924 --> 12:29.425
He's only the coolest guy
in the entire universe.

12:29.493 --> 12:30.293
It's just your user name.

12:30.361 --> 12:32.762
Six-two, 185 pounds?

12:32.830 --> 12:34.330
I don't know, Morgan.
Listen to me.

12:34.398 --> 12:36.833
Everybody is taller
and thinner online.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.569
It's called the Internet
hotness conversion factor.

12:39.636 --> 12:40.837
What do you want
your job to be?

12:40.904 --> 12:42.572
Uh, manager at the Buy More.

12:44.441 --> 12:45.708
Make him an astronaut.

12:45.776 --> 12:47.810
What about lion tamer?
- Wait, I got it. I got it.

12:47.878 --> 12:49.045
I just don't know
about this whole

12:49.113 --> 12:51.280
World Wide Web business.

12:51.348 --> 12:52.749
That ain't no way
to meet a woman.

12:52.816 --> 12:54.183
You know how
I met my wife?

12:54.251 --> 12:55.284
Church picnic.

12:55.352 --> 12:56.686
Yeah, look
how that worked out.

12:56.754 --> 13:00.456
There was no hiding who you were
or-or how you felt.

13:00.524 --> 13:02.091
The very first time

13:02.159 --> 13:04.694
I laid my eyes
on Gladys, I knew.

13:04.762 --> 13:06.028
Good Lord.

13:06.096 --> 13:07.029
Who are they?

13:07.097 --> 13:08.364
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

13:08.432 --> 13:09.999
Users who matched your profile.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.401
This ain't no
church picnic.

13:11.468 --> 13:13.536
Check out Red Hot Mama.

13:13.604 --> 13:15.471
<i>Muy caliente.</i>

13:15.539 --> 13:17.974
What about the Internet hotness
conversion factor?

13:18.041 --> 13:19.275
Doesn't that work both ways?

13:19.343 --> 13:20.977
Why can't you see her face
in that picture?

13:21.044 --> 13:23.045
Focus on the body,
Michael.

13:23.113 --> 13:24.380
Gee whiz, Mike.

13:24.448 --> 13:26.616
We're trying to help
you find love here.

13:27.918 --> 13:30.086
Dirty, nasty, filthy love.

13:30.154 --> 13:32.121
So, then the Greek guy says,

13:32.189 --> 13:34.123
"Well, at least we know
where the olive went."

13:42.733 --> 13:45.268
My sentiments exactly.

13:49.807 --> 13:51.174
Can I let you in
on little a secret

13:51.241 --> 13:52.575
about your neighbors,
Mr...?

13:52.643 --> 13:54.410
Carmichael. Charles.

13:54.478 --> 13:56.446
They bore me.

13:56.513 --> 13:57.814
Oh, yeah?

13:57.881 --> 13:59.081
Yeah, it's, uh...

13:59.149 --> 14:01.184
it's not really
my scene either.

14:01.251 --> 14:05.254
Perhaps the two of us can, uh,
get together sometime.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.490
Maybe engage in something
a little more...

14:07.558 --> 14:10.193
stimulating?

14:10.260 --> 14:11.227
Don't-Don't...

14:11.295 --> 14:12.328
Sorry. I... Slippery.

14:12.396 --> 14:14.564
That's very kind
of you to offer

14:14.631 --> 14:15.731
and it sounds like
a lot of fun,

14:15.799 --> 14:17.834
but I am very, very married.

14:19.036 --> 14:21.103
Congratulations,
Mr. Carmichael.

14:21.171 --> 14:22.238
But who isn't?

14:22.306 --> 14:23.339
My husband's right over there.

14:25.676 --> 14:26.976
He's a big fella,
isn't he?

14:27.044 --> 14:28.578
What line of work is he in?

14:28.645 --> 14:29.846
Lumberjack?

14:29.913 --> 14:32.548
The kind that keeps him
out of town.

14:33.851 --> 14:35.218
Charles!

14:37.554 --> 14:39.021
Is that your wife?

14:39.089 --> 14:41.057
She seems very...

14:41.124 --> 14:43.192
pretty.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.161
Well, got to run.
You know how it is.

14:45.229 --> 14:46.596
The old ball and chain.

14:46.663 --> 14:47.830
Listen, Charles.

14:47.898 --> 14:49.432
I just live
right across the street.

14:49.500 --> 14:53.503
So call me...
when the honeymoon's over.

14:53.570 --> 14:55.538
I've got a chain, too.

14:57.374 --> 14:58.741
I bet you do.

15:00.911 --> 15:02.778
Excuse me.

15:05.582 --> 15:06.782
Well?

15:06.850 --> 15:08.017
No flashes.
No nothing.

15:08.085 --> 15:09.418
I think our
neighbors are clean.

15:09.486 --> 15:11.888
Except for that lady
across the street.

15:11.955 --> 15:13.456
She's got a dirty mouth.

15:13.524 --> 15:15.992
Well, are you sure
you checked everybody?

15:16.059 --> 15:17.159
Maybe we got the
wrong cul-de-sac.

15:17.227 --> 15:18.261
Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael?

15:18.328 --> 15:19.729
Would you come inside, please?

15:19.796 --> 15:20.930
There's a slight problem
with your cable.

15:31.708 --> 15:33.442
Looks like one of ours.

15:40.250 --> 15:43.686
Uh, correction--
that was one of ours.

15:43.754 --> 15:46.622
That bug was stolen from
a CIA substation in Omaha

15:46.690 --> 15:48.190
in '06.

15:48.258 --> 15:49.325
Now it belongs to FULCRUM.

15:49.393 --> 15:51.093
And here I thought

15:51.161 --> 15:53.029
we were all looking for a
garden-variety terrorist.

15:53.096 --> 15:55.398
Better hurry up, buddy.

15:55.465 --> 15:56.532
Your wieners are burning.

16:02.773 --> 16:04.540
I knew these people
creeped me out.

16:29.190 --> 16:30.757
Hi. Did you sleep well?

16:30.825 --> 16:32.492
Like a log, honey.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.427
How did you sleep?

16:34.495 --> 16:36.863
What are you doing?
Did Casey find more bugs?

16:36.931 --> 16:38.465
I'm cooking breakfast.

16:38.533 --> 16:40.467
Casey swept the house.
It's clean.

16:40.535 --> 16:42.802
Okay. Well, are we going
to invite the neighbors over?

16:42.870 --> 16:46.339
No, Chuck.
I-I'm cooking for you.

16:50.645 --> 16:51.912
What?

16:51.979 --> 16:52.946
Nothing.

16:54.815 --> 16:56.416
It's just funny.

16:56.484 --> 16:59.352
I never pictured
you doing this.

16:59.420 --> 17:00.987
Well, what can I say?

17:01.055 --> 17:02.055
I'm versatile.

17:03.257 --> 17:04.391
Sit.

17:06.594 --> 17:07.661
Hold on.

17:07.728 --> 17:09.128
Are-Are-Are you enjoying

17:09.195 --> 17:10.297
this whole Martha Stewart thing?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.900
I can't believe it.

17:13.968 --> 17:15.902
Please tell me you're
not going soft on me.

17:15.970 --> 17:17.404
Just shut up
and eat your breakfast.

17:17.471 --> 17:20.006
You better be careful, Sarah.

17:20.074 --> 17:21.775
One day you might actually
turn into a real girl.

17:58.312 --> 18:00.113
Sweetie.

18:00.181 --> 18:01.381
Sweetie?

18:01.449 --> 18:02.649
I almost forgot.

18:02.717 --> 18:04.918
Would you mind swinging
by the store for me?

18:12.827 --> 18:14.494
Have a great
day at work.

18:16.697 --> 18:18.465
Okay.

18:48.896 --> 18:49.929
Wipe that look off your face.

18:49.997 --> 18:51.398
Wait, that's Sarah's...

18:51.465 --> 18:53.933
Invisible ink, really?
You guys can't

18:54.001 --> 18:55.935
just use the phone?
- We're dealing with FULCRUM here.

18:56.003 --> 18:57.203
They bugged your house,
they bugged the phones.

18:57.271 --> 18:58.505
Sometimes you got to do it
the old-fashioned way.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.940
"Location clear.
Target on move"?

19:01.008 --> 19:02.575
Wait. You guys figured
out who planted the bug?

19:02.643 --> 19:03.610
Yeah.

19:03.678 --> 19:04.811
Ring any Intersect bells?

19:04.879 --> 19:06.513
Hmm?

19:06.580 --> 19:07.814
Yeah, that's crazy
cougar lady's husband.

19:07.882 --> 19:09.315
How do you know it's him?

19:09.383 --> 19:11.084
Well, while you and Walker
were busy playing house,

19:11.152 --> 19:12.552
I was doing some
old-fashioned spy work.

19:12.620 --> 19:13.753
Pulled a fingerprint
off the bug,

19:13.821 --> 19:14.888
ran it through
the database.

19:14.955 --> 19:15.955
So, who was this
guy before FULCRUM?

19:16.023 --> 19:17.223
CIA Psy-Ops.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.225
Agency shrinks.
A real bunch of weirdos.

19:19.293 --> 19:20.860
I also ran
his bank records.

19:20.928 --> 19:22.195
Turns out he bought
enough of this stuff

19:22.263 --> 19:23.997
to stretch from
here to Gardena.

19:24.065 --> 19:25.665
Infiniband data line.
The same stuff we use

19:25.733 --> 19:28.201
to tap into
the Agency's intranet.

19:28.269 --> 19:29.703
Any idea what
your neighbor was using it for?

19:29.770 --> 19:31.271
I don't know.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.006
Uh, online gaming?

19:33.074 --> 19:34.274
Porn?

19:34.341 --> 19:35.942
Or...
- I don't know. Or...

19:36.010 --> 19:37.377
Hacking into government servers.

19:37.445 --> 19:38.745
Or hacking into
government servers.

19:38.813 --> 19:40.046
I was going to say
that eventually.

19:40.114 --> 19:41.247
Okay, great. I'm glad
you guys cracked it.

19:41.315 --> 19:42.248
Glad I could help.

19:42.316 --> 19:43.616
Help...

19:43.684 --> 19:45.618
by getting us into that house
and onto that computer.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.120
You want me to go
in as Nerd Herd?

19:47.188 --> 19:49.556
Wrong again, Bartowski.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.257
You're going to go in
the old-fashioned way.

19:51.325 --> 19:53.426
You want me to sleep
with our neighbor Sylvia?

19:53.494 --> 19:56.129
No, we want you to pretend
to want to sleep with her,

19:56.197 --> 19:58.031
and then see if you can get
on her FULCRUM husband's PC

19:58.099 --> 19:59.532
and see if you flash
on anything.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.567
You want to throw
in a little sex...

20:00.634 --> 20:01.601
that's your prerogative.

20:03.170 --> 20:04.738
Whatever, Casey. Look,
I just don't know

20:04.805 --> 20:05.839
how Sarah's going
to feel about this.

20:05.906 --> 20:07.140
There's no way she's

20:07.208 --> 20:08.074
going to let her husband
just sleep with...

20:08.142 --> 20:10.343
Is he ready?

20:10.411 --> 20:13.179
Chuck, look, I'm sorry,
but this is our best option.

20:13.247 --> 20:14.748
Target's got the house rigged
with state-of-the-art security.

20:14.815 --> 20:17.851
And since his wife's expressed
a romantic interest in you...

20:17.918 --> 20:19.552
We need you to exploit it.

20:19.620 --> 20:22.055
Oh, exploit it. Gotcha.

20:22.123 --> 20:23.623
Yeah. Textbook CIA.

20:23.691 --> 20:26.159
Look, Casey and I will be
with you every step of the way.

20:26.227 --> 20:27.761
Yeah, if the cougar
gets a little hairy,

20:27.828 --> 20:28.995
you can always tap out.

20:29.063 --> 20:30.330
Look, we understand

20:30.397 --> 20:31.765
if this makes you uncomfortable.

20:31.832 --> 20:33.399
Breaking my fake wedding vows?

20:33.467 --> 20:34.667
No, forget about it.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.102
I'm golden. Just hit me
with another spritz

20:36.170 --> 20:37.470
of that, would you?

20:38.672 --> 20:39.706
Why here?

20:43.778 --> 20:45.612
Mr. Carmichael.

20:45.679 --> 20:48.314
I didn't expect you
to come so quickly.

20:48.382 --> 20:53.052
Charles Carmichael
always comes quickly.

20:54.455 --> 20:55.855
Real smooth, Bartowski.

20:56.891 --> 20:58.358
Come on in.
- Okay.

21:03.964 --> 21:06.533
The cable enters the house

21:06.600 --> 21:08.134
through the northwest corner,
upstairs.

21:08.202 --> 21:09.602
Oh, hey!

21:09.670 --> 21:11.004
This is where
the magic happens.

21:11.071 --> 21:13.339
What do you think your,
uh, wife would say

21:13.407 --> 21:14.874
if she knew you
were up here?

21:14.942 --> 21:16.142
You think she'd
be jealous?

21:16.210 --> 21:18.711
Well, it's like you said.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.046
I mean, the honeymoon--

21:20.114 --> 21:21.815
she is over.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.084
Hi-oh.
If you don't mind me asking,

21:25.152 --> 21:29.122
when was the last time you
and your wife made love?

21:29.190 --> 21:29.856
Well, that's a...

21:29.924 --> 21:31.157
that's a... that's a...

21:32.193 --> 21:33.259
That's a good one.

21:33.327 --> 21:34.594
You know, things have
been a little cold

21:34.662 --> 21:35.962
in that department lately.
- Oh, poor baby.

21:36.030 --> 21:37.597
Oh.

21:37.665 --> 21:39.566
Do you know what I'm going
to do to you, Charles?

21:41.202 --> 21:42.335
I got a pretty good idea.

21:43.504 --> 21:45.839
I'm going to
thaw you out.

21:45.906 --> 21:47.841
Oh, I bet you are,

21:47.908 --> 21:49.576
you-you she-devil.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.945
You temptress,
you've taken my sock off.

21:52.012 --> 21:53.613
Ticklish. Ticklish. Ticklish.

21:53.681 --> 21:54.881
Those are my feet.
That's my feet area.

21:54.949 --> 21:56.382
Maybe-Maybe you know what?

21:56.450 --> 21:57.450
Maybe we could just talk
for a few minutes.

21:57.518 --> 21:58.151
How's that sound?
- Ugh.

21:59.587 --> 22:01.254
You didn't come here to talk.

22:01.322 --> 22:02.589
I didn't?
I didn't come here to talk?

22:02.656 --> 22:04.657
Why, why not?
Talking's perfectly...

22:04.725 --> 22:07.427
Talking's overrated anyway,
isn't it?

22:07.494 --> 22:08.695
No, you know what?

22:08.762 --> 22:09.796
It's just that
I'm a little...

22:09.864 --> 22:10.697
I'm a little nervous
because this is...

22:10.764 --> 22:12.532
the whole
adultery game is

22:12.600 --> 22:14.701
a little new...
little new to me.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.436
And I think, I think
just a... just a drink,

22:16.503 --> 22:18.538
a little liquid courage would
really go a long way right now.

22:20.608 --> 22:22.175
Is Scotch okay?

22:22.243 --> 22:23.309
Sounds delish.

22:23.377 --> 22:25.178
Thank you.

22:25.246 --> 22:26.679
I'll be right here.

22:26.747 --> 22:28.081
But you already knew that.

22:28.148 --> 22:31.317
Crazy person.

22:31.385 --> 22:32.518
Come...

22:33.921 --> 22:34.888
Casey, I'm handcuffed.

22:34.955 --> 22:36.956
Relax. Handcuffs are a cinch.

22:37.024 --> 22:38.458
Really?
- Yeah.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.993
There's a bone in your thumb.
Tiny bone.

22:40.060 --> 22:41.261
Real easy to break.

22:41.328 --> 22:42.695
What you're gonna want to do
is you're gonna

22:42.763 --> 22:44.564
want to apply torsional pressure
to it until it snaps.

22:44.632 --> 22:46.633
I'm not gonna break my bone!

22:46.700 --> 22:48.401
Well, in that case,
you are screwed.

22:51.105 --> 22:52.438
Think. Think. Think.

22:52.506 --> 22:53.640
Wait a minute. Wait.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.008
Hey.

22:55.075 --> 22:56.409
Hey. Hey.

23:01.081 --> 23:01.948
Oh, okay.

23:23.137 --> 23:24.671
Damn it.
Password protected.

23:30.010 --> 23:32.078
Salamander.

23:32.146 --> 23:33.980
Sal... Salamander.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.710
Chuck.

24:14.778 --> 24:16.712
Chuck, you have to get out
of there.

24:16.780 --> 24:19.015
Chuck? Chuck?

24:19.082 --> 24:20.483
Stay where you are, Agent
Walker. I'm going in after him.

24:24.721 --> 24:26.556
Have you tested him yet?

24:28.325 --> 24:30.026
He's upstairs.
I've got him cuffed.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.736
He was just here.

25:02.559 --> 25:04.026
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

25:08.699 --> 25:11.434
He ran the test.

25:11.501 --> 25:13.035
He survived.

25:13.103 --> 25:15.638
We found our subject.

25:25.616 --> 25:27.483
Good afternoon.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.586
Charlie?

25:30.654 --> 25:31.587
Brad.

25:35.959 --> 25:38.194
You are never gonna believe what
just happened to me over there!

25:38.261 --> 25:39.462
Well, this ought to be good.

25:45.769 --> 25:46.402
Ooh.

25:52.776 --> 25:55.044
I send you there undercover

25:55.112 --> 25:58.481
and you not only nearly expose
Mr. Bartowski to FULCRUM

25:58.548 --> 26:00.616
but to an entire cul-de-sac
of civilians?

26:00.684 --> 26:02.685
No excuses, General,
we pooched it.

26:02.753 --> 26:03.552
No.

26:03.620 --> 26:04.854
No, we didn't pooch it.

26:04.921 --> 26:06.389
We didn't pooch it.
General, look,

26:06.456 --> 26:08.624
I-I saw something
on that computer, okay?

26:08.692 --> 26:10.860
I saw... pictures.

26:10.927 --> 26:12.361
How illuminating.
- General,

26:12.429 --> 26:13.796
they weren't regular pictures.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.531
They were like Intersect
pictures,

26:15.599 --> 26:18.167
embedded files, like the ones
that Bryce sent me, only...

26:18.235 --> 26:20.436
very different.

26:20.504 --> 26:22.672
We think Chuck could have
FULCRUM programming in his brain.

26:22.739 --> 26:24.073
In that case,

26:24.141 --> 26:26.375
I'm pulling Mr. Bartowski
from this operation.

26:26.443 --> 26:28.878
But as long as Agent Walker's
cover is intact,

26:28.945 --> 26:30.746
I want you two to lock down
the cul-de-sac,

26:30.814 --> 26:32.081
monitor FULCRUM,

26:32.149 --> 26:33.382
see what else you can uncover

26:33.450 --> 26:35.418
before we make a move
on their cell.

26:35.485 --> 26:37.653
The Carmichaels are getting
a divorce.

26:42.426 --> 26:45.061
Oh, my, my, my.

26:45.128 --> 26:47.329
Don't you look prosperous,
Michael.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.798
Wow, tonight's the night
with the Internet lady?

26:48.865 --> 26:49.799
How ya feeling, big guy?

26:49.866 --> 26:50.900
Like an imposter.

26:50.967 --> 26:52.134
Look at me.

26:52.202 --> 26:53.469
Look at this ridiculous outfit.

26:53.537 --> 26:55.404
She's gonna take one look at me
and realize

26:55.472 --> 26:58.374
I am not a 185-pound
shipping magnate.

26:58.442 --> 27:00.209
Oh, relax.
That suit is...

27:00.277 --> 27:02.211
very slimming.
- That's right.

27:02.279 --> 27:03.813
That's right.
You know what?

27:03.880 --> 27:05.181
It'll make your wallet
look <i>fat.</i>

27:05.248 --> 27:06.549
Yeah, Morgan's right.

27:06.616 --> 27:08.350
That poor lady is not
gonna know what hit her.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.986
You're gonna need a hydraulic
crowbar to pry her off.

27:11.054 --> 27:12.788
Yes.

27:16.359 --> 27:17.593
What do you say, Bartowski?

27:17.661 --> 27:19.261
Should I come clean?

27:19.329 --> 27:20.596
Tell her who
I really am?

27:20.664 --> 27:22.031
You got your girl
without having to lie

27:22.099 --> 27:23.165
about your lowly occupation,
right?

27:23.233 --> 27:25.768
Um... yeah, you know,

27:25.836 --> 27:28.003
I'm-I'm not so sure
I'm the best role model.

27:28.071 --> 27:29.572
You're better than these losers.

27:29.639 --> 27:31.240
When was the last time
any of y'all had dates?

27:31.308 --> 27:32.475
And I'm not counting Bennigan's.

27:33.910 --> 27:36.712
And you... you and Anna break up
every other week.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.280
And you...

27:38.348 --> 27:40.182
I don't even know what
your affiliation is, Elvis.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.418
What does he mean,
my affiliation?

27:42.486 --> 27:43.452
That bathroom thing.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.321
Look, Mike, I don't know.

27:45.388 --> 27:46.789
It's up to you.

27:46.857 --> 27:48.758
But do you really want to be
a part of a relationship

27:48.825 --> 27:50.693
that's founded on lies?

27:54.865 --> 27:56.132
The answer's yes.

27:56.199 --> 27:57.500
Yep.
- Absolutely. He is not thinking.

28:12.282 --> 28:14.116
Oh, my...

28:31.601 --> 28:33.669
Agent Walker,

28:33.737 --> 28:36.438
I've got unknowns
moving on your position.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.474
This is Sarah. Leave a message.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.776
Sarah, Sarah, you and Casey have
to get out of the cul-de-sac

28:40.844 --> 28:42.778
immediately-- I just flashed,
I just flashed on something.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.713
I think it was FULCRUM--
it was something that I...

28:44.781 --> 28:45.981
I uploaded
off the computer, okay.

28:46.049 --> 28:48.284
Excuse me. Hi.
Yeah, could you

28:48.351 --> 28:50.152
give me a hand with
my cable, please?

28:50.220 --> 28:52.788
The company that built
the neighborhood is a front.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.423
Uh, if you're looking
for free premium channels

28:54.491 --> 28:55.591
I'm not the guy.

28:55.659 --> 28:56.659
Oh, no, no, no.

28:56.726 --> 28:57.693
It's nothing like that.

28:57.761 --> 28:59.128
It's not just a house.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.429
The entire neighborhood
is FULCRUM.

29:00.497 --> 29:01.697
For some reason

29:01.765 --> 29:03.499
I'm getting some kind of
weird interference.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.568
I think somebody in the neighborhood
might be running some kind

29:05.635 --> 29:07.636
of high-powered
electronic equipment.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.171
Actually, I think
it... it might be

29:09.239 --> 29:10.472
that house right
over there.

29:25.388 --> 29:26.288
Hi.

29:26.356 --> 29:27.556
I'm so sorry

29:27.624 --> 29:28.824
about what happened
with your husband.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.759
It must have been awful.

29:30.827 --> 29:33.395
It's times like these
you need your neighbors most.

29:33.463 --> 29:35.264
Oh. Thank you.

29:35.332 --> 29:36.932
Uh, come in.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.267
I hope you like brownies.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.547
Looking for the wife?

29:51.615 --> 29:54.283
She's having a chat
with the ladies.

29:59.723 --> 30:01.690
You feeling all right, buddy?

30:34.594 --> 30:36.261
How's his blood pressure?
- A little high.

30:36.329 --> 30:37.930
Should I give him
more sedative?

30:37.997 --> 30:39.398
No.
- Sarah?

30:39.465 --> 30:41.300
He's going to be fine.
- Sarah?

30:41.367 --> 30:42.701
Where's Sarah?

30:42.769 --> 30:44.536
Sarah?

30:44.604 --> 30:47.506
Where's Sarah?

30:47.574 --> 30:49.508
Where's my wife?
- Mr. Carmichael,

30:49.576 --> 30:50.609
she isn't your wife.

30:50.677 --> 30:53.478
She's a CIA agent.

30:53.546 --> 30:54.780
And so are you.

30:56.015 --> 30:57.382
Wha...

30:57.450 --> 30:59.518
What do you want with me?

30:59.586 --> 31:02.888
You have got
a very special brain.

31:02.956 --> 31:04.590
Don't worry.

31:04.657 --> 31:07.125
We're going to do everything
we can to not damage it.

31:07.193 --> 31:08.594
Damage? Damage?

31:08.661 --> 31:09.861
What is he talking about?

31:09.929 --> 31:11.563
What you saw upstairs
was a small part

31:11.631 --> 31:12.831
of a computer program.

31:12.899 --> 31:14.366
The CIA designed it

31:14.434 --> 31:16.268
to implant intelligence
directly into agents

31:16.336 --> 31:17.703
through encoded
images.

31:17.770 --> 31:19.738
But the CIA gave up
on the program.

31:19.806 --> 31:21.473
They decided to
slug it out,

31:21.541 --> 31:23.942
fighting the war on terror
using Cold War tactics.

31:24.010 --> 31:25.477
But we're training agents

31:25.545 --> 31:27.245
who are ready to fight
tomorrow's wars.

31:27.313 --> 31:29.948
How would you like to be a part
of that future?

31:30.016 --> 31:31.750
How would you like
to be part of FULCRUM?

31:33.987 --> 31:35.854
What about...

31:35.922 --> 31:37.456
What about her?

31:37.523 --> 31:39.691
Look, I'll do whatever you want,
just let her go.

31:39.759 --> 31:42.794
Don't tell me you have feelings

31:42.862 --> 31:44.663
for your partner?
- Boy,

31:44.731 --> 31:46.198
you really let her get
into your head, huh?

31:46.265 --> 31:47.299
What did she tell you?

31:47.367 --> 31:49.568
That someday you two
would be together?

31:49.636 --> 31:52.504
Maybe settle down
in a cute little cul-de-sac

31:52.572 --> 31:53.739
like this one?

31:53.806 --> 31:55.841
You're funny.

31:55.908 --> 31:58.944
This place isn't real.

31:59.012 --> 32:02.114
Her feelings for you
aren't real.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.548
Don't worry.

32:03.616 --> 32:05.651
This next part should help
you get over her.

32:07.687 --> 32:09.521
If he survives it.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.199
Chuck!

32:23.403 --> 32:25.437
He can't hear you.

33:11.050 --> 33:13.218
No, no, no!

33:45.852 --> 33:47.385
Chuck... Chuck...

33:53.292 --> 33:54.926
Oh, he's toast.
- Chuck.

33:54.994 --> 33:56.261
Get him out of here.

33:56.329 --> 33:58.563
Dump him where you
dumped the others.

34:04.504 --> 34:05.537
What just happened?

34:05.605 --> 34:08.106
Mr. Carmichael.

34:10.909 --> 34:13.378
Do you know where you are,
Mr. Carmichael?

34:13.446 --> 34:16.648
Beneath Meadow Branch
subdivision in a FULCRUM lab

34:16.716 --> 34:18.583
that was built as part
of a secret initiative.

34:20.052 --> 34:21.686
What initiative?

34:21.754 --> 34:23.722
To rebuild
the Intersect computer.

34:23.790 --> 34:26.424
Oh, my God, it worked.

34:26.492 --> 34:27.958
Can I ask just

34:28.027 --> 34:30.195
one more question?

34:30.263 --> 34:33.665
You mind if we,
uh, test your wife next?

34:33.733 --> 34:35.500
Wife?

34:37.069 --> 34:39.170
I don't have a wife.

35:00.193 --> 35:01.893
Before you run the test,

35:01.961 --> 35:03.361
I'd like to tell Agent Walker
something.

35:03.429 --> 35:05.897
Agent Walker.

35:08.668 --> 35:10.202
Now we have a name.

35:25.551 --> 35:26.518
Close your eyes.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.194
No, no, no!

36:08.094 --> 36:09.327
Are you okay?

36:09.395 --> 36:11.096
Yeah. You?

36:11.163 --> 36:12.631
I think so.

36:16.569 --> 36:19.104
Somebody call the cable guy?

36:30.663 --> 36:33.432
Take these guys to
the detention center.

36:33.499 --> 36:35.434
That one goes to
the agency morgue.

36:35.501 --> 36:37.202
We're not done
with him yet.

36:43.176 --> 36:45.077
Besides testing on humans,

36:45.144 --> 36:46.945
it appears that FULCRUM
is perilously close

36:47.013 --> 36:49.247
to completing
their own Intersect computer,

36:49.315 --> 36:51.316
making Bartowski
more important than ever.

36:51.384 --> 36:53.251
His life has never been
in more danger.

36:53.319 --> 36:54.987
The honeymoon is over,
Agent Walker.

36:55.054 --> 36:57.389
Yes, ma'am.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.626
Hey, everything okay?

37:00.693 --> 37:02.995
Yeah, just
a routine debriefing.

37:03.062 --> 37:04.763
Uh, so I was wondering

37:04.831 --> 37:07.366
if you wanted to swing by
the old cul-de-sac tonight.

37:07.433 --> 37:08.667
Why?

37:08.735 --> 37:11.737
Uh, I don't know, I
mean, I... you know,

37:11.804 --> 37:13.205
I figured we've
still got the place,

37:13.272 --> 37:14.606
and Ellie still thinks
we're house-sitting,

37:14.674 --> 37:17.209
so I thought that,

37:17.276 --> 37:19.945
you know, we could maybe
enjoy a night in the suburbs,

37:20.013 --> 37:21.613
order in, rent a movie.

37:21.681 --> 37:24.416
No mission to worry about,
just Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael.

37:24.484 --> 37:26.685
Maybe have some fun.
- Chuck,

37:26.753 --> 37:27.719
we can't go back there.

37:27.787 --> 37:28.987
It was just a cover.

37:29.055 --> 37:31.723
Yeah, I know that, I
just thought that...

37:31.791 --> 37:33.091
Casey and I have to shut down
the operation.

37:33.159 --> 37:34.059
Can we talk later?

37:36.229 --> 37:38.330
Absolutely.

37:38.398 --> 37:39.831
Uh, Chuck?

37:39.899 --> 37:40.832
Yeah.

37:40.900 --> 37:42.968
I'm going to need that back.

37:43.036 --> 37:45.270
Right.

37:47.540 --> 37:49.608
Almost forgot.

38:04.590 --> 38:05.524
Hey.

38:05.591 --> 38:06.925
How was the big date?

38:06.993 --> 38:11.096
Gentlemen, it was a night
of exquisite passion.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.699
I did things with that woman
I didn't even know existed,

38:13.766 --> 38:15.600
which are likely illegal.
- Yes! So you took our advice?

38:15.668 --> 38:17.202
I lied my ass off.

38:17.270 --> 38:19.304
What did we tell you?
- Way to get back in the game, chief.

38:19.372 --> 38:21.740
Enough chitchat. We're
burning daylight.

38:21.808 --> 38:23.108
Lester, man the
Nerd Herd desk.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.043
Jeff, help out
the green shirts.

38:25.111 --> 38:26.845
I want the new inventory
stocked by lunch.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.847
My store had better be
shipshape.

38:28.915 --> 38:30.182
What, you're making us work?

38:30.249 --> 38:31.316
What about your new girlfriend?

38:31.384 --> 38:32.617
What about her?

38:32.685 --> 38:33.952
She's gonna be here
any minute.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.721
I invited
her down.

38:35.788 --> 38:38.523
Wow.

38:48.501 --> 38:50.202
Michael,

38:50.269 --> 38:51.503
what's going on?

38:51.571 --> 38:54.372
Why are you
dressed like that?

38:54.440 --> 38:55.841
Because I work here.

38:55.908 --> 38:58.343
I am a manager
at the Buy More, Bolonia.

38:58.411 --> 39:00.912
But I thought
you were a boat captain.

39:00.980 --> 39:02.614
Shipping magnate,

39:02.682 --> 39:04.750
but that was something
I just made up

39:04.817 --> 39:06.785
so I could get to do
what we did last night.

39:06.853 --> 39:10.322
But after we did
what we did last night, I...

39:10.389 --> 39:12.257
I can't bear to lie
to you anymore,

39:12.325 --> 39:17.129
so I'll understand if you want
to tell me where to shove it,

39:17.196 --> 39:18.563
but I hope you'll forgive me.

39:18.631 --> 39:20.499
I do forgive you.

39:20.566 --> 39:22.534
The truth is

39:22.602 --> 39:25.070
I wasn't 100% honest
on my dating profile either.

39:26.372 --> 39:28.473
Aw, honey, I don't mind
a little extra weight.

39:29.842 --> 39:30.942
I have a son.

39:31.010 --> 39:34.246
Oh, w-well, s-so what?

39:34.313 --> 39:35.614
I love kids.

39:35.681 --> 39:37.482
He's 26 years old.

39:37.550 --> 39:39.017
Hmm.
- I thought you found out.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.085
I thought that's
why you wanted

39:40.153 --> 39:41.319
to meet here
in the store.

39:41.387 --> 39:42.621
I don't follow.

39:42.688 --> 39:44.890
Michael, my son
works here.

39:51.864 --> 39:53.932
Please, Lord,
let it be Bartowski.

40:06.012 --> 40:08.547
Mother.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.515
<i>Mi hijo.</i>

40:12.218 --> 40:13.919
Ah, yeah.

40:13.986 --> 40:15.554
<i>¿Mi hijo?</i>

40:16.722 --> 40:18.657
You're banging my mom?

40:19.859 --> 40:22.294
Hey.

40:22.361 --> 40:24.629
What did I tell you?

40:24.697 --> 40:26.565
House-sitting
really changes things, huh?

40:26.632 --> 40:29.968
Absolutely, just-just not
in the way you were hoping,

40:30.036 --> 40:31.636
El.

40:31.704 --> 40:33.104
To tell you
the truth,

40:33.172 --> 40:35.240
the suburbs were kind of
a disaster for me and Sarah.

40:35.308 --> 40:38.009
Well, what happened?
What went wrong?

40:38.077 --> 40:41.580
I guess something that's
been wrong from the start.

40:41.647 --> 40:43.281
You know?

40:43.349 --> 40:46.818
Are... you guys aren't
breaking up, are you?

40:46.886 --> 40:50.555
No, no, no, no, no, trust me,
Sarah's not going anywhere.

40:50.623 --> 40:52.224
Chuck, I guess I don't...

40:52.291 --> 40:54.159
I don't know
what you're saying exactly.

40:54.227 --> 40:56.027
Look, El, I know
how much you love Sarah

40:56.095 --> 40:58.163
and I know how much you love
the idea of us

40:58.231 --> 41:00.031
and us moving forward
with you and Devon,

41:00.099 --> 41:02.400
but we're not anything
like you guys.

41:02.468 --> 41:04.603
But you guys seem so perfect.

41:04.670 --> 41:08.840
Yeah, I know, I guess, but being
in that house with her,

41:08.908 --> 41:11.943
<i>it was so close</i>
<i>to being perfect--</i>

41:12.011 --> 41:16.514
<i>the way I had always pictured</i>
<i>it would be--</i>

41:16.582 --> 41:17.716
<i>that I realized</i>

41:17.783 --> 41:20.352
<i>what was wrong</i>
<i>with that picture.</i>

41:22.688 --> 41:24.789
<i>And it was us.</i>

41:30.363 --> 41:32.397
Sarah and I are never going
to be anything more

41:32.465 --> 41:33.932
than what we are right now.

41:37.303 --> 41:39.838
And you know what?

41:39.906 --> 41:41.406
I'm okay with that.

41:44.143 --> 41:46.311
Anyway...

41:52.518 --> 41:54.552
Agent Walker,

41:54.620 --> 41:56.154
you get everything
you need?

41:56.222 --> 41:57.522
Yeah.
