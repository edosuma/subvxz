WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:04.034
It may not look like it,
but we're professionals.

00:04.104 --> 00:05.366
Do us a favor...

00:05.438 --> 00:07.531
Don't try this at home!
Whoa!

00:07.607 --> 00:10.838
Narrator: On this episode
of "Mythbusters,"

00:10.910 --> 00:14.744
Adam and Jamie come out
all guns blazing...

00:14.814 --> 00:16.008
It's still hot.

00:16.082 --> 00:19.711
...as they find out
if a freakish 3-way ricochet...

00:19.786 --> 00:21.515
It just went shotgun.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.716
...could result in the shooter
shooting himself.

00:24.791 --> 00:27.123
And I see a hole in me.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.684
Then Tory, Grant, and Jessi
turn lumberjack...

00:29.763 --> 00:31.993
Maybe we should've
yelled "timber."

00:32.064 --> 00:33.430
...testing the myth

00:33.500 --> 00:36.162
that a conifer could be used
as a living catapult...

00:36.236 --> 00:37.567
Jessi:
Good luck, Buster!

00:37.637 --> 00:39.161
You're our only hope.

00:39.239 --> 00:43.039
To fling an infected corpse
up and over a castle wall.

00:43.109 --> 00:44.269
Hyah!

00:44.344 --> 00:46.073
Whoa!

00:48.681 --> 00:50.444
Who are the Mythbusters?

00:50.517 --> 00:53.042
- Adam Savage...
- Here comes chaos.

00:53.119 --> 00:54.609
...and Jamie Hyneman.

00:55.922 --> 00:56.911
We're gonna have
an adventure.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.184
Between them,

00:58.258 --> 01:01.694
more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.285
Joining them...

01:03.363 --> 01:05.092
...Kari Byron...

01:05.165 --> 01:06.723
Right tool for the job.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.427
...Tory Belleci...

01:08.501 --> 01:10.526
Okay, you want to play rough,
little gopher.

01:10.603 --> 01:11.592
...Grant Imahara...

01:11.671 --> 01:12.797
Good to go.

01:12.872 --> 01:14.737
...and featuring Jessi Combs.

01:14.808 --> 01:15.797
Oh, it's awesome!

01:15.875 --> 01:18.366
They don't just tell
the myths.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.003
They put them to the test.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.550
To kick-start the first myth,
Adam decides on a field trip.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.656
They told me you were
over here doing research.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.754
Looks to me
like you're playing pool.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.232
I'm doing both.
I've got our next story.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.599
It's a shooting myth
from our gun-toting fans,

01:43.670 --> 01:45.194
and allow me
to demonstrate.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.535
Let's say this red ball
represents our shooter.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.905
Let's say the cue ball here

01:49.976 --> 01:51.534
represents the bullet
from his gun.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.876
The myth is that our shooter
can fire a bullet

01:54.948 --> 01:57.815
and can bounce off
one, two, three surfaces

01:57.884 --> 02:00.114
and come back
and kill the shooter.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.619
Well,
that'd ruin your day.

02:01.688 --> 02:02.916
I know.
Let's test it.

02:02.989 --> 02:04.513
Okay.

02:04.591 --> 02:07.958
The myth takes place
in a half-built skyscraper.

02:08.026 --> 02:10.996
It's a pin-up parable
for poetic justice.

02:11.064 --> 02:14.727
One angry shot at just the wrong
angle misses the target,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.634
ricochets off three steel beams,

02:17.704 --> 02:20.764
and returns to the shooter
in less than a heartbeat.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.138
Aah!

02:23.209 --> 02:24.767
So how do you want
to start this one?

02:24.844 --> 02:26.607
Well,
I figure we need to start

02:26.679 --> 02:29.011
with some kind
of a controlled situation,

02:29.082 --> 02:30.709
you know, a bench test.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.273
Well, to my mind,
that just means

02:32.352 --> 02:34.081
we set up
three adjustable steel plates

02:34.154 --> 02:35.121
probably in our bunker,

02:35.188 --> 02:36.246
fire a gun into them,

02:36.322 --> 02:38.187
and see if it ricochets off
all three plates

02:38.258 --> 02:39.247
and kills its shooter.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.622
Works for me.

02:40.693 --> 02:41.751
All right.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.556
You ready to let
all hell break loose in here?

02:46.633 --> 02:48.624
- Yep.
- [Chuckles]

02:48.701 --> 02:51.761
From bare bunker
to ballistic death trap,

02:51.838 --> 02:54.500
the transformation
is fast and efficient.

02:54.574 --> 02:56.508
Three steel plates
in three vises

02:56.576 --> 02:58.009
and one .45 caliber pistol,

02:58.077 --> 03:00.944
and what we've got here
is pretty much the bench test

03:01.014 --> 03:03.312
setting up the circumstances
of this myth

03:03.383 --> 03:05.851
in which this pistol
will release its bullet,

03:05.919 --> 03:07.819
firing it
into plate number one,

03:07.887 --> 03:10.481
where it will reflect off,
in theory at least,

03:10.557 --> 03:12.991
at a 90-degree angle
into plate number two,

03:13.059 --> 03:14.356
doing the same
to plate number three

03:14.427 --> 03:15.553
and hopefully coming

03:15.628 --> 03:17.926
all the way back around
to where it started,

03:17.997 --> 03:19.828
potentially killing its shooter.

03:19.899 --> 03:20.866
Now, to make sure

03:20.934 --> 03:22.765
that everything's set up
nice and jake,

03:22.835 --> 03:24.803
I'm gonna use
some mirrors and a laser.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.738
Narrator: With the help
of predictive technology,

03:27.807 --> 03:29.536
they're doing Pythagoras proud.

03:31.644 --> 03:35.080
The final angle won't quite make
a perfect diamond,

03:35.148 --> 03:40.245
but there's method behind
this deliberate misdeflection.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.584
Yeah, it brings the path
of the bullet back here

03:42.655 --> 03:44.282
so that we hopefully
don't hit the gun.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.188
- Okay.
- I don't want to hurt it.

03:46.259 --> 03:49.023
Adam has no such concerns

03:49.095 --> 03:51.893
about punching a hole
in his partner in crime.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.195
I brought some motivation
for our gun.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.393
I brought a shooter.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.561
I look bad-ass.

03:57.637 --> 03:58.661
[Laughing] Yeah.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.069
I figure
we put him right here,

04:00.139 --> 04:01.800
if there's any meat
on the bones of this,

04:01.874 --> 04:03.637
he's gonna end up
with a bullet hole in him.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.041
Okay.

04:05.111 --> 04:07.636
Adam: What we've got set up
inside the bunker right now

04:07.714 --> 04:09.181
is a really idealized situation.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.773
In actuality,

04:10.850 --> 04:12.943
I'm not so sure
it's gonna make it perfectly

04:13.019 --> 04:13.951
all the way through.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.385
I don't know.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.978
I've seen a lot about bullets
when they hit metal objects,

04:17.055 --> 04:18.853
and I'm expecting some spatter.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.223
Narrator:
Adam puts paper to steel

04:21.293 --> 04:22.955
to help mark
the points of impact.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.929
When he's done,

04:24.998 --> 04:26.761
Jamie carefully loads
the weapon.

04:29.602 --> 04:33.470
Bunker's hot.

04:33.539 --> 04:38.602
And they're ready to shoot
with intent to kill dirty Jamie.

04:38.678 --> 04:42.136
This is ricocheting bullet.
Ideal scenario.

04:42.215 --> 04:45.810
In 3... 2... 1.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.585
I only see one plate
with a mark on it.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.785
Second plate
doesn't have anything.

04:53.860 --> 04:54.952
Well, that's interesting,
isn't it?

04:55.028 --> 04:57.394
On closer inspection,

04:57.463 --> 04:59.488
that turns out to be
an understatement.

04:59.565 --> 05:00.623
[Laughs]

05:00.700 --> 05:03.100
I can already see
what's going on here.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.431
Look at the back wall.

05:04.504 --> 05:08.031
Yeah,
all right along here,

05:08.107 --> 05:10.302
it's spread out
almost four feet.

05:10.376 --> 05:13.436
So much for, like,
dink, dink, dink.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.276
It just went shotgun.

05:15.348 --> 05:18.317
It looks like
the lead bullet shattered,

05:18.384 --> 05:22.343
and the high-speed replay
confirms their consternation.

05:22.422 --> 05:23.753
Well, that didn't work.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.051
There's your problem.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.386
That bullet came in

05:26.459 --> 05:29.826
and it just kind of laid flat
right along the plate.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.056
It did.
It was so beautiful.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.597
It followed the line
just perfectly.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.429
The fire behind it
just gorgeous, and then pbht!

05:35.501 --> 05:36.991
Yeah,
there's got to be a bullet

05:37.070 --> 05:38.765
that holds together
better than that.

05:38.838 --> 05:39.930
Yeah, I think so.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.566
Time to dip
into Jamie's private stash.

05:42.642 --> 05:43.904
Jamie:
Well, lead didn't do it.

05:43.976 --> 05:45.136
So, this time around,

05:45.211 --> 05:47.543
we're gonna use
full metal-jacketed bullets.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.672
That means they're covered
with copper everywhere

05:49.749 --> 05:51.307
except for the bottom.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.046
I think the fact that this thing
is encased in metal,

05:54.120 --> 05:55.519
that it's not just raw lead,

05:55.588 --> 05:58.318
means that we are gonna see
a better bounce from this.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.688
It might not be the bounce

05:59.759 --> 06:01.727
that we were hoping
in the beginning,

06:01.794 --> 06:04.319
but it's got to be better
than just raw lead.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.389
Narrator:
With the paper replaced

06:07.467 --> 06:09.435
and the gun
locked and loaded...

06:09.502 --> 06:14.132
In 3... 2... 1.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.873
[Clattering]

06:17.944 --> 06:19.502
Same thing.

06:21.414 --> 06:25.373
The full metal jacket fared
marginally better than lead,

06:25.451 --> 06:28.852
but they still couldn't get
a single ricochet.

06:28.921 --> 06:31.014
All right.
There it goes.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.718
On the dotted line.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.522
Spatters again.

06:35.595 --> 06:38.155
It might as well
be a paintball.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.597
It even didn't get anywhere
close to that second plate.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.497
Well, dude, that was
a full metal jacket.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.559
I don't know where
we're gonna go from there.

06:44.637 --> 06:47.834
Narrator:
But Jamie's brought along

06:47.907 --> 06:51.274
the FMJ's
bigger and tougher brother.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.777
Will the total metal jacket
do better

06:52.845 --> 06:54.005
than the full metal jacket?

06:54.080 --> 06:56.776
Well, this one is
completely covered with copper,

06:56.849 --> 06:58.510
so it should do better.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.280
Narrator: There's only one way
to find out.

07:01.354 --> 07:06.485
In 3... 2... 1.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.795
Still no hit
on the second plate.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.401
It's time
to get innovative.

07:19.705 --> 07:22.173
Adam: Not only is it not hitting
the second or the third plate,

07:22.241 --> 07:24.300
but it's hitting the first plate
at 45 degrees

07:24.377 --> 07:26.641
and leaving at like 5 degrees.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.476
That's not a ricochet.
That's like a splatter.

07:29.549 --> 07:30.709
Look at this.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.648
This looks like a piece of fruit
that you ran over.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.652
Are you paying attention?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.210
We got to come up
with something

07:36.289 --> 07:37.347
better than a bullet now.

07:37.423 --> 07:38.754
Come on.

07:38.825 --> 07:39.951
Bullets are out.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.392
We need something
to bounce around like a ball,

07:42.462 --> 07:44.453
so I figure why not use a ball?

07:44.530 --> 07:47.522
Specifically,
a hardened steel ball bearing.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.124
These puppies
aren't gonna be splattering

07:49.202 --> 07:50.726
when they hit a steel plate.

07:50.803 --> 07:55.240
And with any luck,
we'll see one return to sender.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.937
Narrator: The boys will return
to bouncing bullets,

07:59.011 --> 08:01.377
but for now,
they'll try their luck

08:01.447 --> 08:03.745
with something rounder
and harder.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.808
The ball bearing we're now
firing into these steel plates

08:06.886 --> 08:08.285
is hardened chrome steel,

08:08.354 --> 08:11.380
and it is actually much harder
than these steel plates.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.687
Hopefully with these,
we're going to see

08:13.759 --> 08:16.660
the bouncing, ricocheting action
that we're hoping for

08:16.729 --> 08:19.391
on all three plates,
right back to our shooter.

08:19.465 --> 08:22.195
Narrator: To enable the gun
to shoot the bearing,

08:22.268 --> 08:25.294
Jamie fits it inside a sleeve
called a sabot.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.840
Let's do this thing.
I'm feeling good about it.

08:29.909 --> 08:31.672
We've got to get
something better

08:31.744 --> 08:33.405
than what we've gotten
so far.

08:33.479 --> 08:36.471
All right.
Ball bearings.

08:36.549 --> 08:41.111
In 3... 2... 1.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.552
Boom!

08:42.621 --> 08:43.714
Ha!

08:43.789 --> 08:45.689
I see a mark
on the second plate.

08:47.393 --> 08:50.260
Oh, and I see a hole in me.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.194
Hey!

08:52.265 --> 08:53.493
Look at that.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.865
Well, let's get in there
and see.

08:59.772 --> 09:03.071
Narrator:
It looks like the ball bearing
has, indeed, returned

09:03.142 --> 09:04.200
with a vengeance.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.643
[Laughing]

09:06.712 --> 09:09.840
Plate number one has a mark,
plate number two has a mark,

09:09.916 --> 09:13.283
plate number three has a mark,
and you're dead, sucker.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.286
To get the full picture,

09:15.354 --> 09:19.051
the boys settle down
to peruse the high-speed.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.456
Jamie: Doink.

09:20.526 --> 09:22.756
Oh, look at it slow down.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.888
That is a lot of energy lost
each time it hits.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.763
In high-speed it's almost like
it's slowing to a crawl.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.268
Well, I want to actually take
some measurements

09:31.337 --> 09:32.531
and do the math...

09:32.605 --> 09:34.971
how fast it's actually going
after that third plate.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.269
We need to know
if that's lethal.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.673
Yes.

09:37.743 --> 09:41.270
Narrator: Confirming the myth
means killing the shooter.

09:41.347 --> 09:44.180
And let's acknowledge that
less than 10% of the real Jamie

09:44.250 --> 09:47.447
is actually made from cardboard.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.011
Dude, it's not lethal.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.114
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.886
I come up with
106 feet per second

09:53.960 --> 09:56.155
or 72 miles per hour.

09:56.228 --> 09:59.356
It would [bleep] you off,
but it wouldn't kill you.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.959
I can throw a baseball
faster than that.

10:03.035 --> 10:05.060
I'll bet you can't.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.798
[Laughs]

10:06.872 --> 10:08.669
But the challenge is out there

10:08.741 --> 10:12.040
to find a hard surface
that might bounce some bullets.

10:13.379 --> 10:14.641
Are you gonna keep that?

10:14.714 --> 10:16.011
Are you kidding?

10:16.082 --> 10:18.676
This is how I'm riding in
the high occupancy vehicle lane.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.116
Good luck with that.

10:22.521 --> 10:26.617
Narrator: Now to test out
an infectious tree tale.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.694
So, the story goes that during
the medieval castle sieges,

10:30.763 --> 10:33.231
attacking armies would use
nearby pine trees.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.698
They would bend them back,

10:34.767 --> 10:35.791
load them up with bodies

10:35.868 --> 10:37.768
that had died
from smallpox or the plague,

10:37.837 --> 10:39.998
launch them over the wall
into the enemy's castle.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.437
And at that point,

10:41.507 --> 10:44.374
people inside the castle would
contract some lethal disease

10:44.443 --> 10:45.774
and ultimately be defeated.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.745
Wow, so like
the first biological warfare.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.508
Exactly.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.847
Narrator: It's been a cartoon
classic for generations.

10:52.918 --> 10:56.479
But how will it work
in real life?

10:56.555 --> 10:59.820
They'll have to somehow attach
a body to the top of a tree,

10:59.892 --> 11:02.793
pull back the tree
without snapping it off,

11:02.862 --> 11:05.831
and then launch the cadaver
far and high enough

11:05.898 --> 11:08.833
to clear a castle wall.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.835
Man: Blimey!
It's a dead bloke.

11:10.903 --> 11:12.666
The dead have risen!

11:12.738 --> 11:13.762
Okay,
so right off the bat,

11:13.839 --> 11:15.306
I think this is gonna be
kind of difficult.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.398
Why?

11:16.475 --> 11:17.703
Well, think about it.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.268
For us to be able to fling
a disease-infected body

11:20.346 --> 11:21.870
up and over some castle walls,

11:21.947 --> 11:22.914
we have to bend a tree
back like this.

11:22.982 --> 11:24.506
And that's
a significant distance,

11:24.583 --> 11:26.380
it could either break
right at the trunk

11:26.452 --> 11:28.010
or even possibly
completely uproot.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.520
So, it sounds like
we need to find

11:29.588 --> 11:30.748
the elastic limit
of a tree.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.484
Let's go
to a tree plantation,

11:32.558 --> 11:34.321
find a nice,
tall, straight tree,

11:34.393 --> 11:35.553
and bend it back
until it breaks.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.255
All right, well,
once we've done that,

11:37.329 --> 11:38.956
let's take another
similar-sized tree

11:39.031 --> 11:40.589
bend it back
just before it breaks.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.531
Then we'll load up Buster,
release the tree,

11:42.601 --> 11:44.000
and see if it has
enough energy

11:44.070 --> 11:45.537
to send him
over the castle wall.

11:48.007 --> 11:50.635
Narrator: Now, we can't just
skip out to any old forest

11:50.710 --> 11:54.168
and start twanging trees.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.612
Jim Curry from
Loggers Unlimited

11:56.682 --> 12:02.211
has 22 acres of mixed woodland
already destined for chipping.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.449
We're trying to fling
some diseased corpses
over a castle wall,

12:04.523 --> 12:05.512
and we need some trees.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.115
Ah, you've come
to the right place.

12:07.193 --> 12:10.253
Hmm, didn't so much
as bat an eyelid.

12:10.329 --> 12:13.594
Minutes later, Jessi tracks down
a suitable specimen.

12:13.666 --> 12:17.193
Guys, I found
the perfect tree!

12:17.269 --> 12:20.636
According to Jim,
it's a California gray pine.

12:20.706 --> 12:22.731
That fits the bill perfectly,

12:22.808 --> 12:26.335
because this myth specifically
calls for a conifer.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.744
Let's say you were the head
of an invading army,

12:28.814 --> 12:30.907
and you came up
with this crazy idea

12:30.983 --> 12:34.009
to use trees to fling diseased
bodies over castle walls.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.054
Which type of tree
would you use?

12:36.122 --> 12:37.680
A deciduous one,

12:37.757 --> 12:40.487
with all the curvy branches
and the curvy trunk?

12:40.559 --> 12:43.790
Or the long, tall, straight
coniferous one?

12:43.863 --> 12:44.955
That's right.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.463
We're going
with the coniferous one, too.

12:49.268 --> 12:50.929
Tory:
Why am I climbing it?

12:51.003 --> 12:53.369
Well, I need to get up here
and tie a line,

12:53.439 --> 12:56.203
so that way we can bend our tree
down to the ground.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.675
We're gonna have a force meter
attached to the line,

12:58.744 --> 13:00.371
so that way
we'll be able to read

13:00.446 --> 13:02.073
how many pounds of force
it takes

13:02.148 --> 13:03.172
to get this tree down.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.580
Narrator: Remember,

13:04.650 --> 13:07.983
this first test is designed
to gather one vital statistic...

13:08.053 --> 13:12.649
to see how far the tree bends
before it breaks.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.990
On the other end of that line
is a giant comealong.

13:16.061 --> 13:19.588
Hopefully it's strong enough
to actually break the tree.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.428
Finally,
we have a force gauge

13:21.500 --> 13:23.491
to tell us
how many pounds of force

13:23.569 --> 13:25.628
that tree will take
before it breaks.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.103
It's time to get cranking.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.164
Who's first
on comealong duty?

13:29.241 --> 13:30.299
You are!

13:30.376 --> 13:31.707
Dang it.

13:31.777 --> 13:34.268
Narrator: In keeping
with the myth's rustic nature,

13:34.346 --> 13:35.870
they're using a hand winch.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.473
Grant's the first
to bend his arm

13:38.551 --> 13:40.678
and make a prediction.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.914
Grant: As far as the amount
of force it will take...

13:42.988 --> 13:43.977
I don't know.

13:44.056 --> 13:45.421
Maybe 1,000 pounds?

13:45.491 --> 13:48.517
I'm not an arborist.

13:48.594 --> 13:52.428
Narrator: Slowly but surely,
the pine starts to bend.

13:52.498 --> 13:57.367
Incredibly, this full-grown tree
arches 45 degrees,

13:57.436 --> 13:59.563
and it's groaning
under the pressure.

13:59.638 --> 14:04.302
Tory: Wow, look at
how far bent over it is.

14:04.376 --> 14:06.606
Creeping up on 1,500.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.512
Well, it's bending.
It's not breaking yet.

14:09.582 --> 14:14.076
The rope still strains,
but the gauge stalls at 2,000.

14:14.153 --> 14:18.089
That just might mean that
this conifer is ready to crack.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.793
Whoa!

14:21.861 --> 14:23.988
[Cheering]

14:24.063 --> 14:25.030
Whoa!

14:25.097 --> 14:26.086
That was dramatic.

14:26.165 --> 14:29.430
Narrator:
It snapped like a twig,

14:29.501 --> 14:31.765
so they've now got
the number they needed...

14:31.837 --> 14:36.069
2,000 pounds of force should
crack a medium-sized gray pine.

14:36.141 --> 14:38.336
[Cheering]

14:38.410 --> 14:41.072
With that data in mind,

14:41.146 --> 14:44.172
they're now ready to see
if a man can fly...

14:44.250 --> 14:45.547
a dead man.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.212
Jessi: For our second tree,
we found a very similar tree.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.255
So, it's time
to bring in the big guns.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.517
And this thing has
a 40,000-pound winch on it,

14:52.591 --> 14:55.788
which is gonna make our jobs
a whole lot easier.

14:55.861 --> 14:58.227
Narrator: In fact,
with this near identical tree,

14:58.297 --> 15:00.390
it's technology
to the rescue all around.

15:00.466 --> 15:03.867
Tory's tree-climbing days
are over.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.029
- I hope he stays.
- All right.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.005
Good luck, buddy.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.132
Why are you wishing him luck?
He's dead.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.408
Narrator: Even in death,
there's no dignity

15:13.479 --> 15:16.710
for your professional
crash test dummy.

15:16.782 --> 15:20.377
Still, they all have
their parts to play.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.477
Tory: Now, Jessi is gonna be
operating that winch.

15:22.554 --> 15:24.215
Grant will be watching
the force meter.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.258
As soon as we get
to the right pounds of force,

15:26.325 --> 15:28.486
he'll let me know,
and then we'll release the rope,

15:28.560 --> 15:29.492
launching Buster.

15:29.561 --> 15:31.426
Now, we could use
a quick release.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.829
But we thought,
since it's a medieval myth,

15:33.899 --> 15:35.594
why not cut the rope
with a sword?

15:35.668 --> 15:37.158
I know.
It's a samurai sword.

15:37.236 --> 15:38.999
But at least
we're making an effort.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.469
Narrator: They're all hoping

15:43.542 --> 15:47.103
that Buster will soar
like a pox-ridden pigeon.

15:47.179 --> 15:49.010
But there's always the chance

15:49.081 --> 15:53.950
that our man will, in fact,
be a tree hugger.

15:54.019 --> 15:54.986
This is tree bending.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.043
It's very unpredictable,

15:56.121 --> 15:57.588
so it's really hard
to take a guess

15:57.656 --> 15:58.884
at what's really gonna happen.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.323
[Engine turns over]

16:03.062 --> 16:04.324
Narrator:
The plan is to cut the rope

16:04.396 --> 16:06.660
when the gauge hits 2,000.

16:06.732 --> 16:09.826
That was the maximum force
inflicted on the last tree

16:09.902 --> 16:12.302
before we shivered its timbers.

16:12.371 --> 16:13.531
2,000 pounds.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.266
The massive bent trunk

16:15.341 --> 16:18.504
looks like it could fling Buster
into the next county.

16:18.577 --> 16:20.772
With cast and crew backed off

16:20.846 --> 16:23.178
to what they hope
is a safe distance,

16:23.248 --> 16:24.977
Tory cuts loose.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.039
Here we go.

16:26.118 --> 16:28.109
In 3... 2... 1.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.621
[Laughs]

16:36.695 --> 16:38.959
It's a total failure.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.397
Falling is not flying,

16:41.467 --> 16:45.301
and Buster's more dislodged
than discharged.

16:45.371 --> 16:48.534
Well, we've proved
one thing.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.700
Gravity still works.

16:50.776 --> 16:51.970
Jessi: [laughs]

16:53.178 --> 16:56.113
Jamie: Nice day
for a ricochet, huh?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.842
[Chuckles]

16:57.916 --> 16:59.645
Now, they've decided
for safety's sake

16:59.718 --> 17:03.779
to relocate
to the wide open spaces.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.519
They've already done bench tests
with solid steel plates,

17:07.593 --> 17:11.324
but the bullets all burst
before bouncing.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.865
It just went shotgun.

17:13.932 --> 17:15.262
So, where does that leave us?

17:15.334 --> 17:17.426
Well, we wondered if we were
thinking about it all wrong.

17:17.502 --> 17:18.992
Maybe it's not
the bullet's fault.

17:19.070 --> 17:20.196
Maybe we were asking it

17:20.271 --> 17:22.205
to bounce off something
way too hard.

17:22.273 --> 17:24.765
Suppose we gave it
some softer surfaces.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.538
Maybe it would bounce better.

17:26.612 --> 17:28.910
And that's what
we're just about to do.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.142
Narrator:
The first surface they'll test

17:31.216 --> 17:33.912
is much softer than steel
and way heavier.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.783
[Chuckles]

17:35.854 --> 17:37.913
Well, you want to pop
one of those out of there

17:37.990 --> 17:39.651
and into here,
and we'll clamp it in?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.421
Jamie: So, why are we using
a lead target?

17:42.494 --> 17:45.691
Well, the bullets we're using
are coated in copper,

17:45.764 --> 17:47.356
and copper is harder than lead.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.798
So, I'm hoping that copper

17:48.867 --> 17:51.131
will hold the bullet
together well enough

17:51.203 --> 17:53.000
to not splatter
when it hits this,

17:53.072 --> 17:55.097
and it can continue on its way.

17:55.174 --> 17:58.302
Narrator:
And will the speed be lethal?

17:58.377 --> 17:59.867
For these tests,

17:59.945 --> 18:02.971
they'll start by measuring
the angle of deflection

18:03.048 --> 18:04.345
off just one surface.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.884
The bullet, if it bounces,

18:06.952 --> 18:08.977
should pass through
the backboard.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.723
Range is hot.

18:15.794 --> 18:18.194
Narrator:
The bullet they're using

18:18.263 --> 18:21.357
is the fully copper-coated
total metal jacket.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.594
3... 2... 1.

18:23.669 --> 18:25.364
[Gunshot]

18:25.437 --> 18:27.405
Ha!
I can see the hole.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.168
- Really?
- It's at a wonderful angle.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.367
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:31.243 --> 18:34.974
Providing the bullet stayed
more or less in one piece,

18:35.047 --> 18:38.505
this looks like a step
in the right direction.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.451
Look, I can see
what a 45-degree angle
of reflection is,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.044
and I think
we're at like 42.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.454
That's far steeper
than I thought we'd get.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.355
The only thing
we need to know now

18:47.426 --> 18:48.620
is how fast it's going.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.094
Well, let's get to high-speed
and do some math.

18:51.163 --> 18:56.226
But the ultraslow motion shows
something they hadn't expected.

18:56.301 --> 19:01.329
Adam: A real tumbling piece
of twisted metal at that point.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.033
Yeah,
that surprises me.

19:03.108 --> 19:07.568
Now Adam determines the speed
of that twisted lump of metal.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.541
Well, all right.
Here's the math.

19:11.617 --> 19:14.211
Our bullet,
after it struck the lead plate,

19:14.286 --> 19:16.481
was only going
171 feet per second,

19:16.555 --> 19:17.681
116 miles per hour,

19:17.756 --> 19:19.951
when it went
through the backboard.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.253
That's not lethal.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.886
- Lost almost
all its energy.
- Yeah.

19:23.962 --> 19:25.896
Time to change up

19:25.964 --> 19:29.900
to a surface
that might make a difference.

19:29.968 --> 19:33.028
Next up is one of these
cinder-block pavers.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.072
Why a paver?

19:34.139 --> 19:36.607
Well,
this material is soft enough

19:36.675 --> 19:39.007
that it will allow the bullet
to dig into it

19:39.077 --> 19:41.545
and then have to
climb out of the groove,

19:41.613 --> 19:43.205
giving us the angle we want.

19:43.282 --> 19:45.113
- Good to go.
- All right.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.209
You got a prediction
for the angle for the paver?

19:47.286 --> 19:48.810
- No.
- No?

19:48.887 --> 19:50.218
But if you were to have
a prediction,

19:50.289 --> 19:51.551
you got any idea
what it would be?

19:51.623 --> 19:52.749
I don't know.

19:52.824 --> 19:55.156
[Laughs]

19:55.227 --> 19:56.455
Just pull the trigger.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.053
3... 2... 1.

20:00.098 --> 20:02.566
Narrator: The bullet was
squashed but not shattered.

20:06.071 --> 20:09.131
It's now up to Adam
to check on the angle.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.573
Huh.

20:10.642 --> 20:11.802
[Laughs]

20:11.877 --> 20:14.038
It's exactly 1/2
of 45 degrees...

20:14.112 --> 20:16.046
221/2.

20:16.114 --> 20:17.877
That's pretty cool.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.147
Narrator:
And if the bullet is talking,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.018
then Adam is listening.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.023
Adam: So, we're wondering

20:26.091 --> 20:28.457
maybe we're making the bullets
do too much work.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.290
Suppose we shoot them
into their surface

20:30.362 --> 20:31.920
at a shallower angle
of incidence.

20:31.997 --> 20:34.431
Maybe they'll store more of
their energy for subsequent hits

20:34.499 --> 20:36.797
and eventually get all the way
back around to the shooter.

20:36.868 --> 20:39.860
So, we're gonna take that
45-degree angle of incidence,

20:39.938 --> 20:40.962
split it in half,

20:41.039 --> 20:43.064
and start shooting them
into the stuff

20:43.141 --> 20:44.130
at 221/2 degrees.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.642
221/2 degrees
into a paver.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.809
In 3... 2... 1.

20:57.356 --> 20:59.756
[Laughs]

20:59.825 --> 21:01.087
I just had
this warm feeling

21:01.159 --> 21:02.854
about how much I like our job
right now.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.260
Narrator:
With the new shallow angle,

21:05.330 --> 21:06.957
they're looking for speed,

21:07.032 --> 21:09.466
and it seems like
they've found it.

21:09.534 --> 21:13.664
But they'll need to confirm
if they're close to a kill shot.

21:13.739 --> 21:15.468
All right, here we go.
High-speed.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.770
High speed is the objective.

21:17.843 --> 21:20.937
The number they're chasing
for terminal velocity

21:21.013 --> 21:22.742
is 300 feet per second.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.907
That's the best one yet.

21:24.983 --> 21:27.247
Coming off that paver,

21:27.319 --> 21:30.345
that bullet is going
488 feet per second,

21:30.422 --> 21:32.652
or 332 miles an hour.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.214
Well, that could be lethal,
then.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.419
I think so.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.088
I think it's one of
our most promising hits yet.

21:38.163 --> 21:39.425
That's an awesome speed.

21:39.498 --> 21:41.227
So, where to from here?

21:41.300 --> 21:44.929
In different tests,
they got speed and direction.

21:45.003 --> 21:47.938
The trick
is putting them together,

21:48.006 --> 21:51.942
and Adam's almost convinced
he's got the answer.

21:52.010 --> 21:55.036
So Jamie's likeness
is brought into play...

21:55.113 --> 21:56.637
[chuckles]

21:56.715 --> 21:58.512
Which is which?

21:58.583 --> 22:02.952
...as are
the two extra ricochet pavers.

22:03.021 --> 22:05.080
The first bullet hit
the curves on this paving stone

22:05.157 --> 22:06.385
at 221/2 degrees.

22:06.458 --> 22:07.948
Now, we know from doing this
a couple times before

22:08.026 --> 22:11.052
that it's gonna bounce off this
paving stone at about 12 degrees

22:11.129 --> 22:12.289
into this one.

22:12.364 --> 22:13.797
Now, I have this one positioned

22:13.865 --> 22:15.526
so the bullet
will hit this stone

22:15.600 --> 22:16.931
at actually about 30 degrees.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.196
It's a little bit sharper,

22:18.270 --> 22:19.931
but because
the bullet's got less energy,

22:20.005 --> 22:21.734
I think it's gonna dig
less into the stone

22:21.807 --> 22:23.672
and perhaps have
a higher angle of reflection.

22:23.742 --> 22:24.766
Now it's into this one,

22:24.843 --> 22:26.572
where, really,
it's anybody's guess.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.977
I'm positioning it
roughly about there,

22:29.047 --> 22:30.674
and I'm hoping that's enough

22:30.749 --> 22:33.115
to get the bullet
back to Jamie's cutout.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.243
Adam: One bullet,

22:34.319 --> 22:37.652
three paving stones,
and a cardboard Hoosier.

22:37.723 --> 22:40.419
"And a cartridge
in a pear tree"

22:40.492 --> 22:44.986
For the gold,
3... 2... 1.

22:46.765 --> 22:49.666
Narrator: The odds of success
seem astronomically small,

22:49.735 --> 22:53.432
but it looks like
the planets have almost aligned.

22:53.505 --> 22:57.271
I see one mark.
I see two marks.

22:57.342 --> 22:58.741
I see three marks.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.074
Our stones got hit right.

23:01.146 --> 23:03.580
I see a mark right here
in my chest.

23:03.648 --> 23:04.876
Oh! [laughs]

23:04.950 --> 23:07.510
Where's the bullet?
What's that?

23:07.586 --> 23:08.985
Ah, that's it.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.182
It's still hot.
Here, feel that.

23:12.257 --> 23:13.622
Ow. Yeah.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.922
That's it.

23:15.994 --> 23:17.518
[Laughs]

23:17.596 --> 23:19.655
Narrator:
Despite all those odd angles,

23:19.731 --> 23:22.564
they actually got
the triple ricochet.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.932
The need now is for speed.

23:25.003 --> 23:26.732
Dead smack center,
that second...

23:26.805 --> 23:27.829
it's so pretty.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.100
Starting to slow down.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.039
- Three!
- Three!

23:31.109 --> 23:34.101
Oh, and now
we're really slowed down.

23:34.179 --> 23:35.111
[Laughs]

23:35.180 --> 23:36.613
"Got... to get...

23:36.681 --> 23:37.705
to Hyneman."

23:37.783 --> 23:39.546
I think I can.
I think I can.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.210
I think I can.

23:41.286 --> 23:43.880
Kill!
Here it comes.

23:43.955 --> 23:45.923
Even with cement slabs,

23:45.991 --> 23:50.087
they couldn't match up
the speed with the angle.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.722
Adam: He hit the third paving
stone at an angle of 60 degrees

23:52.798 --> 23:55.426
and left it at... [gasps]...
60 degrees,

23:55.500 --> 23:56.524
just like a mirror,

23:56.601 --> 23:58.626
eventually hitting Jamie
in the chest.

23:58.703 --> 24:01.365
Unfortunately, by the time
he hit Jamie in the chest,

24:01.440 --> 24:03.431
he was only going
200 feet per second

24:03.508 --> 24:05.601
or about 135 miles an hour.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.269
Not lethal.

24:07.345 --> 24:08.778
I'm through with you.

24:10.782 --> 24:13.945
Narrator: But we all want to see
a 180 kill shot,

24:14.019 --> 24:16.579
and I promise
that this one's not over

24:16.655 --> 24:19.283
till the flat man screams.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.721
Narrator: Going straight to
full scale proved unproductive

24:24.796 --> 24:28.288
for those bent on flexing a tree
and flinging a corpse.

24:28.366 --> 24:32.097
Now it's time to regroup.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.001
All right,
so that was a complete failure.

24:34.072 --> 24:35.130
Buster didn't launch.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.141
He plummeted straight down
to the ground.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.177
Yeah, I mean, we probably
could have thrown him

24:39.244 --> 24:40.472
farther than he went.

24:40.545 --> 24:42.536
Well, don't give up hope.
That was our first try.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.047
We just went in and did it.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.844
We could be a little bit
more scientific about it.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.009
Go on.

24:47.085 --> 24:48.814
Well, we could do
some small-scale tests,

24:48.887 --> 24:50.081
where we vary
the launch angle

24:50.155 --> 24:52.180
and see if trimming the tree
makes any difference at all.

24:52.257 --> 24:53.884
And we can use
different types of trees

24:53.959 --> 24:55.517
to see which one does
the best job.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.118
Sounds like we need to get
some small-scale trees.

24:57.195 --> 24:58.992
I know.
They're called saplings.

25:02.734 --> 25:05.726
Narrator: So the team orders in
a sapling selection

25:05.804 --> 25:08.398
to see which one has
more spring in its stem.

25:11.309 --> 25:14.278
The first trial tree
is a Douglas fir,

25:14.346 --> 25:15.813
which Tory secures

25:15.881 --> 25:19.373
by clamping a collar
to the base of the trunk.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.112
The collar, in turn,

25:21.186 --> 25:24.212
is fixed tight
to the factory floor.

25:24.289 --> 25:27.781
Jessi prepares an action dude
doll called Mini McBuster,

25:27.859 --> 25:29.850
and a custom-made launch plate

25:29.928 --> 25:33.091
to facilitate flight
by reducing the friction.

25:33.164 --> 25:35.394
We still need to give him
a proper perch,

25:35.467 --> 25:37.731
that when the tree
actually hits its apex,

25:37.802 --> 25:40.896
the force will just continue
to propel McBuster

25:40.972 --> 25:42.906
as far as he can possibly fly.

25:42.974 --> 25:45.272
Narrator: And assuming
that all goes to plan,

25:45.343 --> 25:47.937
Grant lays a scale
that'll measure the distance.

25:48.013 --> 25:49.708
Grant:
None of this guessing.

25:49.781 --> 25:53.308
We're gonna get scientific
about this.

25:53.385 --> 25:56.582
Narrator: And they plan to pull
each of the test trees,

25:56.655 --> 25:57.917
starting with the Douglas fir,

25:57.989 --> 26:02.892
back to exactly the same angle
each and every time.

26:02.961 --> 26:05.794
Grant: Okay, so we're at
a 45-degree deflection.

26:05.864 --> 26:08.662
All right.
We are at 160 pounds of force.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.668
That's a lot of oomph
for that little tree.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.569
Grant, you in position?

26:14.639 --> 26:15.663
Ready.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.071
All right.
Launching.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.770
In 3... 2... 1.

26:22.614 --> 26:24.673
Nice!
That's pretty far.

26:27.218 --> 26:28.879
Narrator:
Now, that's a result.

26:28.954 --> 26:34.153
Mini McBuster has well and truly
left the launch pad.

26:34.225 --> 26:42.257
Douglas fir number one
was 160 pounds force

26:42.334 --> 26:47.101
and a distance of 16' 9".

26:47.172 --> 26:50.630
Next up, redwood.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.803
Narrator: So, the team slides in
the next contestant...

26:53.878 --> 26:57.177
a baby version
of the majestic redwood.

26:58.316 --> 27:01.012
All right.
Redwood tree set for action.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.748
Narrator: Time to see if there's
any benefit to be gained

27:03.822 --> 27:05.449
from a tree change.

27:05.523 --> 27:08.424
Tory:
Launching in 3... 2... 1.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.622
[Laughter]

27:11.696 --> 27:13.891
He went less than half
the distance.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.330
Not even close.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.994
Narrator:
Our diseased doll made it

27:18.069 --> 27:21.095
only a third of the way
to the castle wall.

27:23.842 --> 27:26.333
60 pound load.

27:26.411 --> 27:29.346
Went a distance
of 6 feet.

27:29.414 --> 27:32.110
Next up,
Alaskan cedar.

27:32.183 --> 27:33.582
Narrator:
So, now they've tried two

27:33.652 --> 27:36.951
of their three
best-bet conifers.

27:37.022 --> 27:40.651
Here's hoping the cedar
can fling even farther.

27:40.725 --> 27:43.592
With the angle
once more set to 45,

27:43.662 --> 27:46.790
the only key difference
is the degree of resistance.

27:46.865 --> 27:50.357
The Douglas fir
pulled 160 pounds,

27:50.435 --> 27:53.268
and the redwood just 60.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.034
The cedar is showing 100 pounds.

27:56.107 --> 27:59.133
Still, let's see
if we have a new winner.

27:59.210 --> 28:00.507
Here we go.

28:00.578 --> 28:04.412
Launching mini Buster
in 3... 2... 1.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.351
[Laughter]

28:07.419 --> 28:10.183
Jessi: Whoo-hoo!

28:10.255 --> 28:12.382
Narrator:
The catapult cadaver

28:12.457 --> 28:15.324
flew just 15 times
its own body length...

28:15.393 --> 28:18.851
10 feet on the dot.

28:18.930 --> 28:20.124
Well,
before we pick a tree,

28:20.198 --> 28:21.722
we why don't we
look at the high-speed

28:21.800 --> 28:23.825
and see if we can figure out
why this is happening.

28:23.902 --> 28:25.563
All right.

28:25.637 --> 28:29.300
Narrator:
The first fling they check
is the last one they flung,

28:29.374 --> 28:32.832
the Alaskan cedar.

28:32.911 --> 28:36.176
Tory: The tree is released.
He stays with the tree.

28:36.247 --> 28:39.045
As soon as he gets vertical,
he's released.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.278
In that one,
he was going...

28:41.352 --> 28:43.479
Jessi:
14.2 miles per hour,

28:43.555 --> 28:46.251
which is
20.83 feet per second.

28:46.324 --> 28:50.090
Narrator: Now for
the recalcitrant redwood.

28:50.161 --> 28:53.096
Tory: There's a lot less energy
in this tree.

28:53.164 --> 28:55.155
Grant: It seems
less flexible, actually.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.896
And he left the tree
sooner.

28:58.970 --> 29:02.235
Narrator:
The last replay checked
is the day's big winner,

29:02.307 --> 29:03.797
the Douglas fir.

29:03.875 --> 29:08.175
But watching the high-speed
gives Grant pause for thought.

29:08.246 --> 29:12.478
Now, I'm wondering if we
chop some of these limbs off,

29:12.550 --> 29:14.313
do you think
we could get more speed?

29:14.385 --> 29:16.512
Tory: Yeah. Also,
if we cut off the limbs,

29:16.588 --> 29:18.647
it would cut down on
the wind resistance, as well.

29:18.723 --> 29:20.520
So, we might get him
to go farther.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.559
Well, let's try it.

29:21.626 --> 29:22.615
- All right.
- All right.

29:24.362 --> 29:28.731
Narrator: The jury agrees
that the tree needs a haircut.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.928
And here's why it might work.

29:32.003 --> 29:35.962
One of the main jobs of branches
is to balance the tree.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.507
When the wind blows,

29:37.575 --> 29:40.100
they wave and sway
in every direction.

29:40.178 --> 29:42.806
So the opposite forces
work in concert

29:42.881 --> 29:44.610
to keep the trunk stable.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.479
So to make a tree bend,

29:46.551 --> 29:49.145
it stands to reason
we'd cut off the branches.

29:49.220 --> 29:52.587
That might be enough
to turn this tree torpedo.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.625
[Boing!]

29:57.796 --> 29:58.820
Nice.

29:58.897 --> 30:01.263
That's trimming a tree.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.936
Narrator: So let's see
if it's worth all the effort.

30:07.972 --> 30:11.567
Launching in 3... 2... 1.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.702
Whoa!

30:14.779 --> 30:19.978
The scaling is way too rough
to draw real-world conclusions,

30:20.051 --> 30:22.417
but they can fine-tune
the method

30:22.487 --> 30:25.081
to improve their chances
back in the forest.

30:25.156 --> 30:28.956
His trajectory, though, is
definitely on a downward path.

30:29.027 --> 30:32.019
Yeah, it sort of holds onto him
past vertical.

30:32.096 --> 30:34.564
So, maybe if we had a way
to stop him

30:34.632 --> 30:36.657
before he reaches
that point.

30:36.734 --> 30:38.167
You know,
like a catapult.

30:38.236 --> 30:39.965
Like a tether.
A stopping tether.

30:40.038 --> 30:41.699
All right.
Well, let's try that.

30:41.773 --> 30:45.300
Narrator: They got the distance
but not quite the height.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.867
A tether
should stop the momentum

30:47.946 --> 30:49.470
just short of vertical.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.139
So, if all goes to plan,

30:51.216 --> 30:54.208
this will be
their best shot yet.

30:54.285 --> 30:56.150
- Ready.
Tory: All right.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.416
3... 2... 1.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.157
Whoa!

31:01.226 --> 31:02.784
[Laughter]

31:04.429 --> 31:07.125
Tory: Oh, my God.
He hit the back wall!

31:07.198 --> 31:08.893
Whoa!

31:08.967 --> 31:11.458
[Laughs]

31:11.536 --> 31:13.766
Narrator:
The tether works wonders,

31:13.838 --> 31:17.103
and our little guy's flight
went right off the scale.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.735
Grant: Now, all right.
I know what you're saying.

31:19.811 --> 31:21.301
I can hear it through the TV.

31:21.379 --> 31:25.281
You're saying, "But, Grant,
these trees are young trees.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.977
They're more flexible.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.485
They're not like the trees
you find in the forest

31:29.554 --> 31:30.612
that we're gonna use."

31:30.688 --> 31:31.814
I know.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.915
And that is why
we're gonna take all these ideas

31:33.992 --> 31:35.857
out to the forest
and put them to the test.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.397
Narrator: We all know
that ricochets happen,

31:44.469 --> 31:46.699
and they can be nasty.

31:46.771 --> 31:48.170
Have you gone mad?

31:49.774 --> 31:51.969
But can a bullet
bounce three times

31:52.043 --> 31:53.635
to kill the shooter?

31:53.711 --> 31:55.838
Apparently not.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.941
But we've still got one left
in the chamber.

32:00.018 --> 32:01.280
We are now going to try it

32:01.352 --> 32:03.684
using this piece
of schedule 40 plumbing pipe.

32:03.755 --> 32:08.488
Oh, no, not in this state.
This is merely a raw material.

32:08.559 --> 32:10.254
We're gonna bend it.

32:10.328 --> 32:11.488
[Laughing] Yeah.

32:11.562 --> 32:14.622
Narrator: The triple ricochet
myth is busted.

32:14.699 --> 32:17.361
But Jamie and Adam
have hatched a plan

32:17.435 --> 32:19.027
to replicate the result.

32:19.103 --> 32:21.469
They aim to shoot
through a curvy steel pipe,

32:21.539 --> 32:24.997
and the bending machine's
a mechanical marvel.

32:25.076 --> 32:26.737
Jamie:
So, the way I figure it,

32:26.811 --> 32:29.439
what if we shot the bullet
into something

32:29.514 --> 32:32.540
that didn't actually involve
an impact,

32:32.617 --> 32:34.346
like, say, a bent pipe.

32:34.419 --> 32:36.751
It does one thing.

32:36.821 --> 32:38.846
And it does it
really well.

32:38.923 --> 32:39.855
I like that.

32:39.924 --> 32:42.825
There we go.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.759
Adam: [laughs]

32:44.829 --> 32:48.560
Does this remind you of when
you used to hunt mastodon?

32:48.633 --> 32:50.328
It's like a big macaroni.

32:50.401 --> 32:53.131
[Chuckles]

32:53.204 --> 32:55.069
He really did hunt mastodon.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.401
Narrator: All that remains

32:56.474 --> 32:58.499
is for Adam to mount
and secure the pipe

32:58.576 --> 33:02.012
while Jamie positions
a fat slab of ballistics gel

33:02.080 --> 33:04.571
to hopefully catch the bullet.

33:07.852 --> 33:09.843
Adam: At this point,
you may be wondering

33:09.921 --> 33:12.253
what is the curve of the bent
pipe you're shooting into?

33:12.323 --> 33:13.881
Well, it's a good question.

33:13.958 --> 33:17.086
Right now, this pipe has
a radius of about 88 inches.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.220
That means if it was
a complete circle,

33:19.297 --> 33:21.162
it would be
about 15 feet across.

33:21.232 --> 33:22.358
Why haven't we bent it

33:22.433 --> 33:24.025
to come all the way back around
to the gun?

33:24.102 --> 33:25.501
That's simply because

33:25.570 --> 33:27.936
we're not sure this is
going to work at all.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.474
So, we're going to
incrementally sneak up on it.

33:30.541 --> 33:32.509
Why put all our eggs
in one basket?

33:32.577 --> 33:34.477
Jamie: Range is hot.

33:37.782 --> 33:42.583
Firing into
an 88-inch radius tube.

33:42.653 --> 33:44.416
3... 2... 1.

33:46.824 --> 33:47.950
Looks like it came out.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.288
And I can see
where it hit.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.384
Uh-huh.

33:56.567 --> 34:00.059
Wow, I had no idea
it would be so pristine.

34:00.138 --> 34:01.628
Look at that.

34:01.706 --> 34:06.473
It's a nice little flat on it
where it slid around the pipe.

34:06.544 --> 34:09.603
Narrator: So a bullet can
at least slide around steel

34:09.679 --> 34:11.909
and return with a vengeance.

34:11.983 --> 34:17.944
It penetrated 141/2 inches,
which would cripple the shooter.

34:18.022 --> 34:20.786
Jamie: Our first and shallowest
bend on the pipe

34:20.858 --> 34:23.485
gave us 622 feet per second
as an exit speed,

34:23.561 --> 34:25.495
which means
it was fully lethal.

34:25.563 --> 34:26.928
Not only that,

34:26.998 --> 34:29.989
but if you look at how far
it went in this ballistics gel,

34:30.068 --> 34:31.295
if it hit me this way,

34:31.369 --> 34:33.530
it would have gone
clean through me.

34:33.603 --> 34:35.400
[Motor turns over]

34:38.309 --> 34:41.437
Narrator: So now to ramp up
to a fitting finale,

34:41.512 --> 34:43.103
the machine's redeployed

34:43.181 --> 34:46.378
to give maximum curve
for their bending buck.

34:46.451 --> 34:49.887
The plan is to wrestle the pipe
almost back in a circle.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.054
23-inch radius.

34:54.125 --> 34:55.786
That's pretty tight.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.487
That's pretty tight.

34:57.562 --> 35:01.555
More friction decreases
the chance of success,

35:01.632 --> 35:03.327
but they're both optimistic.

35:03.401 --> 35:05.392
Let's go see how it fits.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.234
I think it's gonna work.
I'm feeling so good about this.

35:08.306 --> 35:11.332
Narrator: In fact,
Adam's so fired up,

35:11.409 --> 35:13.274
he offers himself as the target.

35:13.344 --> 35:14.572
Well, kind of.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.009
The range is hot.

35:18.916 --> 35:22.044
46-inch diameter pipe
coming all the way back around

35:22.120 --> 35:24.486
in 3... 2... 1.

35:26.491 --> 35:27.651
Did it go through?

35:27.725 --> 35:29.955
You've got a hole
in your chest there, buddy.

35:30.027 --> 35:31.392
[Chuckles]

35:32.597 --> 35:35.566
Narrator: If bad guy Adam
actually had a heart,

35:35.633 --> 35:37.533
he now has a hole in it.

35:39.036 --> 35:40.503
Still got 101/2 inches.

35:40.571 --> 35:41.560
All right.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.903
Well, the final speed
will be determined

35:43.975 --> 35:45.636
by the high-speed camera.

35:49.347 --> 35:55.547
We got a final exit speed
of 338 feet per second.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.485
- Yes.
- A kill shot!

35:57.555 --> 35:59.921
That would be
a kill shot.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.391
Well,
potentially lethal.

36:02.460 --> 36:03.620
Nice work.

36:03.694 --> 36:05.525
I'm all happy now.

36:07.665 --> 36:11.101
Narrator: There's no doubt
it's a stunning result.

36:11.169 --> 36:15.196
But we know that the myth
has meandered somewhat

36:15.273 --> 36:17.332
from its ricochet roots.

36:17.408 --> 36:19.467
But what's the takeaway
from this myth?

36:19.544 --> 36:21.808
Well, we know that people
get killed by ricochets.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.210
That's not the point.

36:23.281 --> 36:26.307
The point is that a bullet
bouncing off three surfaces...

36:26.384 --> 36:27.476
bing, bing, bing!..

36:27.552 --> 36:30.214
And killing someone
is totally busted.

36:31.289 --> 36:33.849
Narrator: Back at the scene
of their last public failure,

36:33.925 --> 36:35.586
our corpse catapulters

36:35.660 --> 36:39.687
are buoyed by the fact that
they're now more tree savvy.

36:39.764 --> 36:42.062
Now, the last time
we were out in the forest,

36:42.133 --> 36:43.657
we used a California gray pine.

36:43.734 --> 36:46.430
Unfortunately, that test
was completely unsuccessful.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.935
So, we went back to the shop

36:50.007 --> 36:51.304
and we found,
using small-scale tests,

36:51.375 --> 36:54.367
that a Douglas fir is gonna be
the perfect tree for this job.

36:56.814 --> 37:00.580
Well, guys, that right there
is the perfect Douglas fir.

37:00.651 --> 37:03.051
Tory: And this layout
is perfect.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.418
It gives us plenty of room
to bend the tree back

37:05.489 --> 37:07.218
and plenty of room
to throw Buster.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.657
Let's just get him up there
and start flinging him.

37:09.727 --> 37:11.092
Hang on a minute.
We need a castle.

37:11.162 --> 37:12.220
Oh, we got a castle,

37:12.296 --> 37:14.127
and I think
you're gonna love it.

37:14.198 --> 37:17.725
[Laughter]

37:17.802 --> 37:19.497
Narrator:
The castle is inflated

37:19.570 --> 37:21.504
exactly 100 feet away
from the tree.

37:21.572 --> 37:25.064
That's the minimum historical
distance we could verify

37:25.142 --> 37:28.805
between a fortification
and a forest.

37:28.879 --> 37:31.074
To mark off the height
of the parapet,

37:31.148 --> 37:35.642
balloons are deployed
on the end of a 40-foot string.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.985
Then the team pulls together

37:39.056 --> 37:41.217
to strip back the branches.

37:43.794 --> 37:45.659
Tory: Maybe we should've
yelled "timber."

37:45.730 --> 37:46.958
Timber!

37:47.031 --> 37:49.397
It might be
a little late now.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.470
We just got off the ground,
and you can tell already

37:54.538 --> 37:57.200
how much more spring
this tree has.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.209
This thing
might go far.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.610
Narrator: To help ensure
Buster's smooth release,

38:02.680 --> 38:05.911
Jessi's built him
a man-sized metal back plate.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.416
Jessi,
what do you think?

38:07.485 --> 38:09.976
Do you think he's gonna release
out of that tree?

38:10.054 --> 38:12.784
According to all of our
small-scale tests, absolutely.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.990
With the body secured,
the ropes are attached

38:19.063 --> 38:21.827
in the hope that our man
can go the distance.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.996
Beauty!

38:30.708 --> 38:31.902
Now, as you can tell,

38:31.976 --> 38:34.501
there are two lines
attached to this tree.

38:34.578 --> 38:36.637
We have the pull line
and the tether line.

38:36.714 --> 38:38.807
Now, we learned
from our small-scale tests

38:38.883 --> 38:40.817
that the best launch
we're gonna get is

38:40.885 --> 38:42.853
if the tree stops
just before vertical.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.115
Good luck, Buster!

38:45.189 --> 38:47.749
You're our only hope.

38:47.825 --> 38:51.317
Narrator: Buster hangs 70 feet
above the forest floor.

38:51.395 --> 38:55.627
The castle's a clear and distant
100 feet out in front.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.533
It's the biggest tree
on the lot,

38:58.602 --> 39:02.470
so if this won't do it,
nothing will.

39:02.540 --> 39:04.735
Okay, Jessi,
the force meter's all set.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.334
You can go ahead
and tension up.

39:07.411 --> 39:09.311
We're gonna go
at a really low speed

39:09.380 --> 39:11.405
so we don't jolt Buster
out of the tree

39:11.482 --> 39:12.949
before he's ready to be flung.

39:14.618 --> 39:16.245
Narrator: Tory decides

39:16.320 --> 39:20.381
that the cord is best cut
from up high.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.050
Okay.
We're at 1,000 pounds.

39:23.461 --> 39:27.921
The tension mounts as the...
well, as the tension mounts.

39:27.998 --> 39:31.365
We're at 2,400 pounds.
That's it.

39:31.435 --> 39:33.164
Tory:
So, we have the tree bent back.

39:33.237 --> 39:34.795
We're at 2,400 pounds,
and that's it.

39:34.872 --> 39:35.804
It's maxing out.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.135
We keep pulling the tree back,

39:37.208 --> 39:39.108
and there's no more pounds
of pressure.

39:39.176 --> 39:41.144
I think we're ready
to launch this tree.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.339
Narrator:
So it's all down to this.

39:43.414 --> 39:45.041
And remember that so far

39:45.116 --> 39:48.313
Buster's done no more
than fall off his perch.

39:48.386 --> 39:52.516
Here we go.
Launching in 3... 2... 1.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.353
Hyah!

39:54.425 --> 39:55.949
Whoa!

39:56.026 --> 39:58.324
[Laughs]

40:00.231 --> 40:02.699
Against all predictions,

40:02.767 --> 40:05.395
Buster's arrived
at the castle gate...

40:05.469 --> 40:07.903
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

40:07.972 --> 40:11.635
...but he's fallen just short
of infecting the enemy.

40:11.709 --> 40:14.803
Tory: We applied everything
we learned from the small scale.

40:14.879 --> 40:16.744
We cut off the limbs.
We cut off the crown.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.076
We even tethered the tree.

40:18.149 --> 40:22.245
We cut the rope,
and Buster flew!

40:22.319 --> 40:24.048
We turned a tree
into a catapult.

40:24.121 --> 40:26.817
Narrator: Tory's excited.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.188
He didn't get
over to the castle,

40:28.259 --> 40:29.556
but he made it
to the front door.

40:29.627 --> 40:33.154
Narrator: But just how does one
measure success?

40:33.230 --> 40:38.190
Sadly for him and us,
we have set some benchmarks.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.327
Tory: Whoa!

40:39.403 --> 40:40.495
Grant: Whoa!

40:40.571 --> 40:42.596
Let's look at this
realistically, though, guys.

40:42.673 --> 40:44.868
I mean, we gave this myth
the best chance possible.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.773
We put a castle
as close to a tree

40:46.844 --> 40:49.210
as we could find
any historical reference for,

40:49.280 --> 40:50.975
and we cut off
all the branches.

40:51.048 --> 40:51.707
Yeah,
by the time we do that,

40:52.683 --> 40:54.947
they would've picked us off
from the castle.

40:55.019 --> 40:58.113
And not only that... we pulled
that tree back to 2,400 pounds,

40:58.189 --> 40:59.554
as much as it could handle.

40:59.623 --> 41:02.387
How many ancient horses and
troops would that have taken?

41:02.460 --> 41:04.826
But we did manage
to turn a tree into a catapult.

41:04.895 --> 41:06.385
But as far
as the myth goes,

41:06.464 --> 41:08.455
we weren't able to launch him
100 feet

41:08.532 --> 41:09.829
over a 40-foot castle wall,

41:09.900 --> 41:11.561
so this one's busted.

41:11.635 --> 41:12.829
It's busted.

41:12.903 --> 41:14.370
Busted.

41:14.438 --> 41:15.496
We did get
over the moat.

41:15.573 --> 41:17.097
Oh, yeah.
And we have a bouncy castle.

41:17.174 --> 41:18.732
Yeah!

41:18.809 --> 41:20.333
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

41:20.411 --> 41:22.675
[Laughter]
