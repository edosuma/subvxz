WEBVTT

05:33.000 --> 05:34.250
-Taxi? Ah.
-No, thank you.

06:04.291 --> 06:07.708
That you two had a lot of fun?

06:07.791 --> 06:09.916
The tense you used is too formal.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.583
Idiot! What the hell are you doing?

06:29.083 --> 06:30.541
Welcome to Rome.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.791
By the way,

06:58.875 --> 07:02.625
I hear that you killed them
at your audition in Florence.

07:02.708 --> 07:05.041
I still have to take the final test.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.750
But I heard they only take
Michelin chef's kids

07:08.833 --> 07:10.458
or those with rich parents.

07:10.541 --> 07:11.583
Just like here.

07:11.666 --> 07:13.375
So they're all pompous assholes?

07:13.458 --> 07:14.541
Yeah.

07:14.625 --> 07:17.708
Don't underestimate yourself, Lorenzo.

07:17.791 --> 07:20.291
You're the best student I've had in years.

07:20.375 --> 07:21.208
Remember,

07:21.291 --> 07:24.958
there's a lot of raging, crazy creativity

07:25.041 --> 07:27.166
behind that sad, unassuming look.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.541
Don't be afraid to unleash it.

07:29.625 --> 07:32.250
Let's leave him alone now.
He just graduated.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.666
Lorenzo, go get drunk.

07:34.750 --> 07:35.708
Thanks.

07:36.208 --> 07:37.250
Bye.

07:39.541 --> 07:41.000
Ah, Lina! Let me introduce you

07:41.083 --> 07:44.541
to my dear pain-in-the-butt
Irish cousin, Howard.

08:23.666 --> 08:25.583
You two go. Together.

08:25.666 --> 08:27.500
You can get to know each other.

09:32.583 --> 09:36.208
Howard, don't get smart with me.
Stop hiding.

09:36.291 --> 09:39.041
Can you come up for a second?
I need you here, please.

09:39.541 --> 09:40.708
I'll be right up.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.500
I got five on my AP test.

13:36.708 --> 13:38.833
Howard. Go home.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.875
We have girl stuff to talk about.

13:40.958 --> 13:42.875
Go do your boring man things!

16:48.375 --> 16:50.916
I see your shoulder alignment
is still off.

16:51.750 --> 16:54.375
You're losing power
because you lack fundamentals.

16:54.458 --> 16:55.833
Did you call Banca Milano?

16:58.416 --> 17:01.041
Dad, it's my last summer.
I don't want to go to Milan.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.375
You've spent three summers doing nothing.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.750
Do you need another one?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.625
Right. You think I've never
done anything in my life.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.083
Listen, Alessandro.

17:17.583 --> 17:19.125
You know I'm proud of you.

17:20.458 --> 17:21.458
And I love you.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.375
But I called in favors
to get you these interviews.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.541
If you don't go,
it'll have been a waste of my time.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.041
Yeah, but I never asked for your help.

17:33.125 --> 17:35.000
Know what you'd be without my help?

17:36.833 --> 17:37.791
Nothing.

17:39.416 --> 17:40.583
So call them.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.208
Today.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.916
That's what Italian godmothers are for.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.333
…followed by a double specialization,

23:48.416 --> 23:50.250
Economics and International Relations.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.583
First Harvard, then Oxford,

23:52.666 --> 23:55.375
then an internship at Lloyds of London.

23:55.916 --> 23:58.500
-Like father, like son.
-Exactly.

23:59.166 --> 24:00.708
-Am I right, son?
-Yes.

24:00.791 --> 24:02.875
Congratulations. A great opportunity.

24:02.958 --> 24:05.083
-Excellent.
-A toast.

24:05.166 --> 24:08.333
Although I think
he should be in Abu Dhabi,

24:08.416 --> 24:10.916
where we have most of our family business.

24:12.125 --> 24:14.708
But you know,
young people need their time.

24:15.291 --> 24:16.750
He'd be 18 by then…

24:54.041 --> 24:56.708
Two glasses of wine.
2001, Sangiovese. Thanks.

24:56.791 --> 24:57.916
Very well.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.750
Your ability to embarrass your family

30:14.833 --> 30:16.791
never ceases to amaze me.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.625
Button up that jacket
and come meet Commissioner Grillo.

30:24.166 --> 30:25.291
No.

30:30.208 --> 30:32.041
I'm with a friend. This is Lina.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.875
What the hell do I care about another girl

30:36.958 --> 30:39.000
whose name
you won't even remember tomorrow?

30:40.625 --> 30:41.708
Hurry up.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.500
-Who is it?
-Lorenzo.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.208
Oh. Lorenzo.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.250
-Hi, Greta. How are you?
-Bad.

34:28.958 --> 34:29.833
Very bad.

34:29.916 --> 34:31.333
Bad.

34:31.416 --> 34:32.916
Oh, I meant to tell you.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.125
I know you have an interview
with the Florence people.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.208
Yeah.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.916
-Don't know. We'll see how it goes.
-Hmm.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.833
Who do I see there? Who is she?

34:42.916 --> 34:44.250
Your sous-chef?

34:44.916 --> 34:46.708
No, no, no. She's a tourist,

34:46.791 --> 34:48.541
but she doesn't know anything.

34:48.625 --> 34:52.166
I wanted her to try the best maritozzi
in Italy. Where else if not here?

34:52.250 --> 34:53.875
You're such a smartass.

35:00.541 --> 35:02.416
I "know nothing?"

35:19.250 --> 35:21.875
Here they are. Fresh from the oven.

35:21.958 --> 35:23.166
Thanks.

35:23.250 --> 35:25.958
If you see those pompous blowhards
at Cuisine Royale,

35:26.041 --> 35:27.500
send them my greetings.

35:27.583 --> 35:30.208
They'd be lucky to have someone like you.

35:30.291 --> 35:31.833
Thanks. Bye.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.583
Did you crash my party?

36:49.833 --> 36:51.583
It's the last thing I'd do, trust me.

36:51.666 --> 36:53.750
If you've got something to say,
just say it.

36:53.833 --> 36:56.041
Tell me what you have to say.
I've had enough…

36:56.125 --> 36:58.250
I've been working all day. I'm exhausted.

36:58.333 --> 37:00.208
So I'm leaving.

39:31.208 --> 39:34.166
Howard is one of
the most famous art restorers in town.

39:34.250 --> 39:36.083
He knows Renaissance painters

39:36.166 --> 39:38.333
better than they knew themselves.
Believe me.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.541
And does he paint?

39:42.333 --> 39:45.625
He used to, but he hung up his brush.

39:47.916 --> 39:49.083
Hi, Howard.

39:54.458 --> 39:55.500
Hi, cousin.

47:56.666 --> 47:58.875
I'm sorry. Sorry.

47:58.958 --> 48:00.958
Oh! Lovely child!

48:42.708 --> 48:44.083
Ale, really?

48:44.833 --> 48:47.083
You're always such a piece of shit.

49:50.708 --> 49:53.333
-Who is it? No.
-No…

49:57.583 --> 49:58.500
Who is it?

50:07.958 --> 50:09.791
I don't sell to the public!

54:07.041 --> 54:08.166
Wake up!

54:08.958 --> 54:11.041
Wakey wakey!

54:12.000 --> 54:14.250
It's time to turn over a new leaf.

54:14.333 --> 54:17.250
A colleague of Howard's
has invited us to lunch at her parents'.

54:17.333 --> 54:18.875
Come on!

54:18.958 --> 54:20.333
-No…
-Look, I promise…

54:20.416 --> 54:23.791
Some excellent homemade food
will make you forget that idiot.

54:23.875 --> 54:24.708
Trust me.

55:12.291 --> 55:13.875
Isn't it wonderful, Lina?

55:13.958 --> 55:15.250
Sure.

55:15.333 --> 55:18.250
Wonderful like a newborn baby.

55:21.625 --> 55:24.125
I saw the diary. It's about you know what.

55:25.833 --> 55:27.166
Does she know about that?

55:28.416 --> 55:30.833
I don't know
whether she knows that you know.

55:44.125 --> 55:45.458
You must talk to her.

55:45.541 --> 55:47.375
Me? Why me?

55:47.458 --> 55:48.625
Guess!

55:55.125 --> 55:56.416
-Goat!
-Goat!

56:07.458 --> 56:08.916
For you, Papa.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.541
Hi, Franco. Hi, Martina.

56:11.625 --> 56:13.666
Hi, Franny. Howard!

56:13.750 --> 56:15.125
How are you?

56:33.083 --> 56:34.166
Hi, my love.

56:52.333 --> 56:53.416
For us.

56:53.500 --> 56:54.625
Thank you.

56:54.708 --> 56:56.333
Come. Please.

57:29.708 --> 57:30.708
It smells amazing.

57:31.500 --> 57:33.958
So it's true. You are a chef.

57:34.500 --> 57:36.833
Well, your Italian is not bad at all.

57:36.916 --> 57:37.791
Thanks.

57:37.875 --> 57:39.291
Yes, I'm trying a few things…

57:39.375 --> 57:40.666
Experimenting.

57:40.750 --> 57:43.333
-For the cooking school?
-Yes.

57:43.416 --> 57:46.458
I have my last audition
tomorrow in Florence.

57:47.708 --> 57:48.791
From what I can see,

57:48.875 --> 57:50.875
I'm sure you'll ace it.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.041
Hey, you.

57:53.125 --> 57:54.083
Young hands.

57:54.166 --> 57:55.875
Come help. There's work to do.

57:55.958 --> 57:58.416
-Okay.
-And you, Lo. Hurry up.

57:58.500 --> 58:00.000
-Hurry up.
-Yes. I'm on it.

58:03.458 --> 58:05.250
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

58:28.125 --> 58:29.833
Nonna, calm down.

59:07.291 --> 59:09.000
The fifth is a secret.

59:09.083 --> 59:10.166
Yes, I know.

59:10.250 --> 59:12.375
-So?
-I wasn't going to tell her.

1:00:05.041 --> 1:00:06.125
No. Hi, Gio.

1:00:06.208 --> 1:00:08.083
No, we were only making gelato.

1:00:10.958 --> 1:00:12.125
Let me guess…

1:00:12.625 --> 1:00:13.541
With passion?

1:00:14.583 --> 1:00:16.500
Always with passion!

1:00:16.583 --> 1:00:18.458
Why am I not the one doing the churning?

1:00:18.541 --> 1:00:21.083
You hate churning the gelato. Every time…

1:00:21.166 --> 1:00:23.750
You hate it? That's a new one!

1:00:23.833 --> 1:00:27.041
It's not nice to say it out loud
in front of other people, Lorenzo.

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:30.708
Why are you standing there
like a boiled potato?

1:00:30.791 --> 1:00:31.875
What…

1:00:49.666 --> 1:00:51.583
So much for churning.

1:00:52.958 --> 1:00:54.166
Here I am.

1:00:55.041 --> 1:00:57.625
So this is a barley and pesto salad.

1:00:58.500 --> 1:00:59.541
On your plate,

1:00:59.625 --> 1:01:01.875
you have my mini lasagna cupcakes.

1:01:01.958 --> 1:01:04.166
And these are fried zucchini

1:01:04.250 --> 1:01:07.250
with truffle and caper sauce.

1:01:07.958 --> 1:01:09.625
And to finish, of course,

1:01:09.708 --> 1:01:12.333
we'll eat Nonna's famous pistachio gelato.

1:01:15.166 --> 1:01:16.208
Cheers.

1:01:16.791 --> 1:01:17.625
To us.

1:01:17.708 --> 1:01:19.041
And to me getting old.

1:01:21.958 --> 1:01:24.250
-To us.
-To you, Grandpa.

1:01:24.333 --> 1:01:25.333
To us.

1:01:28.500 --> 1:01:30.583
You really need to talk to her.

1:01:31.250 --> 1:01:35.083
-And you need to be less obvious.
-Oh, come on.

1:01:38.666 --> 1:01:42.208
Do you think I'm not aware
of what's going on behind my back?

1:01:42.291 --> 1:01:44.166
What's going on behind your back?

1:01:44.250 --> 1:01:45.875
How's the racing going, Giorgia?

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:48.083
Giorgia races in the Moto GP.

1:01:48.166 --> 1:01:49.708
-She has a World Ranking.
-Mm?

1:01:49.791 --> 1:01:51.791
Second place last weekend.

1:01:51.875 --> 1:01:53.541
-Wow!
-Congratulations, well done!

1:01:53.625 --> 1:01:54.875
-Congratulations.
-Great.

1:01:54.958 --> 1:01:57.166
Well, losing is losing.

1:01:57.250 --> 1:01:58.916
And I never lose.

1:02:00.583 --> 1:02:03.125
Lo. Where are the pine nuts?

1:02:03.750 --> 1:02:06.291
Gran, I used macadamia nuts instead.

1:02:06.375 --> 1:02:09.125
Mom! He needs to impress the judges.

1:02:09.208 --> 1:02:11.875
He's gonna need to bring some changes.

1:02:11.958 --> 1:02:13.166
It's the Royale.

1:02:13.250 --> 1:02:15.708
They want classic recipes.

1:02:16.708 --> 1:02:18.916
Professor, weren't you the one saying

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.916
that Lorenzo needs to be bolder
in expressing himself?

1:02:22.458 --> 1:02:23.333
Mom, really?

1:02:23.416 --> 1:02:27.708
I firmly believe that,
deep down, Lorenzo is a rebel.

1:02:27.791 --> 1:02:29.833
This pesto is delicious!

1:02:29.916 --> 1:02:33.583
Do you mean like someone
who, deep down, is a liar?

1:02:35.250 --> 1:02:37.000
I love your pesto, Lorenzo.

1:02:37.083 --> 1:02:39.000
Not as much as I love it.

1:02:39.708 --> 1:02:43.291
He's going to open a restaurant
and he will call it "Al Contrario."

1:02:43.375 --> 1:02:45.500
Because everything
will be served backwards.

1:02:45.583 --> 1:02:47.291
Desserts first, appetizers last.

1:02:47.375 --> 1:02:48.958
Well, don't… Mom, we'll see.

1:02:49.041 --> 1:02:50.875
-We'll see.
-Lorenzo.

1:02:50.958 --> 1:02:52.625
Just follow your heart.

1:02:52.708 --> 1:02:53.625
Thanks, Mom.

1:02:53.708 --> 1:02:54.833
Cheers to that.

1:02:54.916 --> 1:02:56.333
-To heart.
-To passion.

1:02:56.416 --> 1:02:57.791
To heart.

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.041
Sorry. Buon appetito.

1:03:39.500 --> 1:03:40.458
Go.

1:03:41.166 --> 1:03:42.250
Go, now!

1:11:15.625 --> 1:11:18.791
Next station: Florence.

1:13:49.958 --> 1:13:51.458
Diamonds of the kitchen.

1:14:09.791 --> 1:14:10.958
Anyway…

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.208
Hi there.

1:18:07.291 --> 1:18:08.666
Welcome.

1:18:08.750 --> 1:18:11.458
Are you here to register
for the photography course?

1:18:12.166 --> 1:18:13.541
No. Um…

1:18:15.708 --> 1:18:16.666
I'm…

1:18:18.250 --> 1:18:20.458
I'm here to…

1:18:28.583 --> 1:18:29.833
Excuse me, Miss?

1:18:47.583 --> 1:18:49.000
Is everything okay?

1:18:52.666 --> 1:18:53.500
I'd…

1:18:54.333 --> 1:18:57.250
I'd like to see Mr. Fossi.

1:18:57.875 --> 1:18:59.250
Yes. And you are…

1:19:01.083 --> 1:19:02.291
His daughter.

1:19:11.166 --> 1:19:14.250
Next up is Lorenzo Ferrazza.

1:19:18.666 --> 1:19:20.291
Good afternoon, chef.

1:19:20.375 --> 1:19:22.291
Good afternoon, Mr. Ferrazza.

1:19:22.375 --> 1:19:24.708
Congratulations on making it this far.

1:19:25.166 --> 1:19:29.458
So, what dish did you bring from home?

1:19:30.666 --> 1:19:34.333
Well, I had prepared
some homemade gelato, but…

1:19:35.125 --> 1:19:36.500
I don't have it anymore.

1:19:38.583 --> 1:19:40.791
But I wanted
to improvise something for you.

1:19:41.291 --> 1:19:44.250
And I wanted to do
something unpredictable,

1:19:44.333 --> 1:19:47.833
something backwards,
which is sort of my style.

1:19:48.375 --> 1:19:51.083
Using only the ingredients
you have here today.

1:19:51.166 --> 1:19:54.416
Why? What's wrong with our cuisine?
Is it predictable?

1:19:55.458 --> 1:19:57.750
Luckily you're here, Mr. Ferrazza.

1:19:58.541 --> 1:20:01.458
You finally came to save us,
by doing things backwards.

1:20:01.541 --> 1:20:03.750
No, chef, of course not. I just wanted--

1:20:03.833 --> 1:20:06.458
No, please. Improvise.

1:20:06.541 --> 1:20:09.541
Your time starts right now.

1:20:29.833 --> 1:20:31.833
I know.
But she said that that's her mother.

1:20:31.916 --> 1:20:33.083
No, I said no.

1:20:33.166 --> 1:20:34.666
-Mr. Fossi…
-No.

1:20:42.875 --> 1:20:43.958
I'm sorry.

1:20:44.041 --> 1:20:47.458
I thought Mr. Fossi was here,
but he went out for a meeting.

1:20:47.541 --> 1:20:49.291
I can get him to call you back.

1:21:01.291 --> 1:21:03.958
What are you doing? You can't go in!

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.541
Sorry, you can't take that.

1:27:15.625 --> 1:27:16.666
Is that it?

1:27:16.750 --> 1:27:18.541
You just let her go?

1:27:18.625 --> 1:27:21.166
I don't think I can force her to stay.

1:27:21.250 --> 1:27:23.333
You let her mother leave too,

1:27:23.416 --> 1:27:25.583
and you spent
the last 18 years regretting it.

1:27:25.666 --> 1:27:28.875
I saw you stop dating other women,

1:27:28.958 --> 1:27:30.708
stop painting, stop living,

1:27:30.791 --> 1:27:33.000
because you felt responsible.

1:27:33.083 --> 1:27:35.500
I can't spend the next 18 years like that!

1:27:38.208 --> 1:27:39.500
Don't you get it?

1:27:40.625 --> 1:27:43.416
Hadley didn't send Lina here
to find that coward,

1:27:43.500 --> 1:27:45.125
but to find you.

1:28:11.708 --> 1:28:12.916
I'm coming.

1:29:07.541 --> 1:29:08.708
A family.

1:31:09.958 --> 1:31:12.083
August 24th.

1:31:12.583 --> 1:31:14.500
I didn't write for a while,

1:31:14.583 --> 1:31:17.666
because I was
trying to have fun, for once.

1:31:19.375 --> 1:31:21.833
I'm really embracing

1:31:21.916 --> 1:31:22.916
the local culture

1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:27.083
and trying my best
to enjoy my last days here.

1:31:27.791 --> 1:31:30.000
And I succeeded.

1:31:30.583 --> 1:31:33.333
For one reason in particular.

1:31:34.333 --> 1:31:35.500
Howard.

1:31:35.583 --> 1:31:38.166
I've been a complete idiot.

1:31:38.708 --> 1:31:41.291
He's sweet, he's kind, he's funny

1:31:41.375 --> 1:31:44.750
and also extremely intelligent.

1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:48.666
But he has an incredible career

1:31:48.750 --> 1:31:50.083
ahead of him in Rome,

1:31:50.166 --> 1:31:53.250
and he must stay here.

1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:57.416
There's a tradition in Italy.

1:31:57.500 --> 1:32:00.958
If you attach a padlock
to one of its bridges

1:32:01.041 --> 1:32:03.166
and throw the key into the Tiber…

1:32:04.541 --> 1:32:07.000
your love will never end.

1:32:08.458 --> 1:32:12.333
I might be letting Howard go,
but I'll keep the key

1:32:12.416 --> 1:32:14.625
and will carry him with me…

1:32:15.291 --> 1:32:16.500
forever.

1:34:56.875 --> 1:35:00.500
Aw. Look who's here!

1:35:00.583 --> 1:35:02.625
Giorgia, are you here with Lorenzo?

1:35:02.708 --> 1:35:05.875
That would be impossible,
given he's no longer here.

1:35:05.958 --> 1:35:07.416
-Because of her.
-What?

1:35:21.250 --> 1:35:23.583
Give me a break.
He left because of you.

1:35:23.666 --> 1:35:25.833
God, I fucking hate Americans!

1:35:29.166 --> 1:35:31.958
Yeah. He's applying
to the Cuisine Academy.

1:35:53.958 --> 1:35:54.916
Hi.

1:35:56.250 --> 1:35:57.916
I need a taxi, please.

1:36:59.708 --> 1:37:02.041
Are you crazy? Careful!

1:37:20.916 --> 1:37:22.041
Thank you.

1:39:52.333 --> 1:39:53.916
August 27th.

1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:55.541
I'm leaving today.

1:39:55.625 --> 1:39:58.916
Honestly, I'm terrified.

1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:00.541
But I'm ready.

1:40:00.625 --> 1:40:02.416
And to you, my daughter,

1:40:02.500 --> 1:40:04.666
I wish with all my heart

1:40:04.750 --> 1:40:07.833
that you'll live your life
o the fullest and bravely,

1:40:08.500 --> 1:40:10.916
like a true Italian woman.

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:12.458
I will try, Mom.

1:40:12.541 --> 1:40:14.666
So thanks, Italy.

1:40:14.750 --> 1:40:16.583
You gave me

1:40:16.666 --> 1:40:18.083
a new life

1:40:18.166 --> 1:40:19.916
and a new purpose.

1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:21.833
I will never forget you,

1:40:21.916 --> 1:40:24.125
my first true love.

1:42:42.666 --> 1:42:43.500
FOR RENT

1:42:52.791 --> 1:42:54.041
Rumor has it

1:42:54.125 --> 1:42:57.875
some American girl
kept showing up and outed them.

1:42:57.958 --> 1:42:59.875
In the end, they had to shut down.

1:42:59.958 --> 1:43:02.583
Lorenzo! What…

1:43:02.666 --> 1:43:05.041
Wow, look at you!

1:43:06.416 --> 1:43:07.916
Greta retired.

1:43:08.833 --> 1:43:10.583
Someone else took over the place.

1:43:12.291 --> 1:43:14.666
No! I love this place.

1:43:15.291 --> 1:43:17.125
That's so sad.

1:43:21.500 --> 1:43:22.708
I'm taking over.

1:43:24.750 --> 1:43:26.625
BACKWARDS

1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:34.250
I'm working out the details
for when I graduate.

1:43:34.333 --> 1:43:35.708
It's crazy, Lorenzo.

1:43:35.791 --> 1:43:38.000
I'm so happy for you.

1:43:38.083 --> 1:43:39.250
Thank you.

1:43:40.041 --> 1:43:41.250
And you? What…

1:43:41.333 --> 1:43:43.375
Have you been here all this time?

1:43:43.916 --> 1:43:45.750
Yes. Gap year.

1:43:46.250 --> 1:43:48.375
I'm taking a few classes.

1:44:01.250 --> 1:44:02.166
Well…

1:44:02.250 --> 1:44:05.708
It was great seeing you.

1:44:05.791 --> 1:44:07.791
Yes. You too.

1:44:12.083 --> 1:44:12.916
Bye.

1:44:13.791 --> 1:44:15.083
Bye.

1:44:19.500 --> 1:44:20.625
Are you okay?

1:44:20.708 --> 1:44:21.541
Yes.

1:44:22.833 --> 1:44:25.750
Some things clearly never change.

1:44:30.541 --> 1:44:31.541
Good.

1:44:32.375 --> 1:44:34.250
I like you the way you are.

1:44:43.041 --> 1:44:44.000
Listen…

1:44:44.541 --> 1:44:46.625
Nonna is making dinner tonight.

1:44:47.500 --> 1:44:50.000
She made her gelato. Wanna come?

1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.291
We'll have to take my Italian death bike.

1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:59.125
I'm sorry, Lorenzo.

1:44:59.208 --> 1:45:00.208
No.

1:45:01.875 --> 1:45:02.750
Okay.

1:45:03.875 --> 1:45:07.083
We'll have to take mine.

1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:20.041
By the way, I figured out
the secret ingredient.

1:45:20.583 --> 1:45:22.041
Better late than never.
