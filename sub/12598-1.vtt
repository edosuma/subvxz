<i>Are you scared?</i>

00:58.125 --> 00:59.750
<i>Do you remember?</i>

01:03.125 --> 01:06.625
<i>The world has made you soft.</i>

01:13.333 --> 01:16.500
<i>In a lifetime a man
plays many parts.</i>

01:18.000 --> 01:20.833
<i>We all hide behind a mask.</i>

01:25.000 --> 01:27.500
<i>Do you even know
who you are?</i>

01:29.583 --> 01:31.292
<i>Probably not.</i>

03:12.000 --> 03:13.500
Grey, hold on.

03:14.583 --> 03:18.000
<i>-Kyle, it 's always the same story.
-What am I supposed to do?</i>

03:18.875 --> 03:22.708
-I've got to work this weekend.
- feel like I never see you anymore.

03:22.708 --> 03:24.708
I miss just going to
the beach together.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.583
Six more months and
we'll be back on Louisiana.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.792
Right, until the next
job comes along.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.500
<i>I've got to go.
I'll see you later,okay?</i>

04:03.333 --> 04:04.958
<i>-Hello?
-Hey, baby.</i>

04:05.542 --> 04:06.750
Hi.

04:07.750 --> 04:11.042
<i>-You okay?
-I'm fine. I'm tired.</i>

04:11.542 --> 04:12.958
Please, drive carefully.

04:12.958 --> 04:16.916
<i>Don't worry. I should be
there in ten minutes, okay?</i>

04:16.916 --> 04:18.333
Kyle, was I selfish?

04:19.750 --> 04:23.625
It 's not easy for you.
No friends, far from home...

04:26.208 --> 04:27.208
Kyle?

04:30.208 --> 04:32.208
-Shit!
-I hate it here.

04:58.208 --> 04:59.792
<i>-Baby?
-''Mon amour''!</i>

05:00.208 --> 05:03.292
Guess what.
I'm taking a few days off.

05:03.583 --> 05:05.792
Just you and me...
and the beach.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.875
Promise?

05:09.083 --> 05:10.583
I promise.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.292
Grey, what 's going on?

05:17.292 --> 05:18.292
Oh my God.

05:21.292 --> 05:22.292
<i>Gray?</i>

05:40.167 --> 05:42.042
Get off! No!

05:42.458 --> 05:46.333
''Milizia''? Can you speak English?
Can you hear me?

05:46.750 --> 05:47.833
No!

05:53.125 --> 05:54.833
My wife is in danger! Help!

06:06.917 --> 06:08.625
Move!

06:31.083 --> 06:32.292
No!

06:56.583 --> 06:57.958
Grey?

07:08.667 --> 07:10.167
Grey?

08:51.542 --> 08:53.750
It 's him!

08:59.167 --> 09:01.458
It 's him!
He killed my wife!

09:24.125 --> 09:28.833
Lack of evidence and
gross negligence by the police...

09:28.833 --> 09:33.333
give me no choice
but to find Mr. Kovic...

09:33.333 --> 09:35.708
not guilty.

09:40.208 --> 09:43.417
-What 's wrong?
-His family has a lot of money.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.208
They bought the judge.
I'm sorry.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.583
By taking the life of a man in the
front of this courthouse...

10:06.583 --> 10:10.083
you showed no respect for the law.

10:10.583 --> 10:14.875
I regrettably sentence
you to life in prision...

10:14.875 --> 10:17.583
without the chance of parole.

11:21.292 --> 11:22.708
Baby Goat.

11:23.125 --> 11:24.625
Bitch.

11:28.208 --> 11:30.208
Stand in line!
Get back.

11:41.708 --> 11:44.292
-You found him!
-Yes, General Hruschov.

11:44.292 --> 11:46.167

-Yes.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.583
-Bring him over.
-Dima!

11:58.083 --> 12:00.167
Welcome to Kravavi.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.583
Shut up!

12:12.250 --> 12:14.958
You can try and run if you like.

12:14.958 --> 12:17.458
No one has ever made it alive.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.833
What is your name?

12:28.458 --> 12:30.958
-Billy Cooper.
-How old are you?

12:31.542 --> 12:32.833
Twenty-one.

12:34.125 --> 12:35.917
Too bad.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.625

12:39.833 --> 12:41.333
March!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.167
It 's class.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.292
I don't understand.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.292
Don't understand?

13:39.167 --> 13:41.167
The ring, ''suka''.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.083
This is from my wife.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.458
Billy Cooper.

15:36.375 --> 15:37.750
Kyle Leblanc.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.583
What?

16:40.583 --> 16:42.583
-Let 's go!
-Where?

16:42.583 --> 16:44.792
Keep your mouth shut!

16:45.875 --> 16:48.083
Go on! Move!

16:58.583 --> 16:59.583
Come on!

17:11.041 --> 17:16.250
-I need to see some green tomorrow.
-You'll get it.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.833
Have fun.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.833
Come on, man!

17:32.833 --> 17:34.958
Fuck off!

17:43.625 --> 17:44.375
No!

18:28.875 --> 18:30.375
March!

18:49.583 --> 18:50.958
Get up!

18:51.375 --> 18:52.875
Now!

19:21.333 --> 19:22.750
Bitch!

19:36.917 --> 19:38.625
Stop!

19:41.292 --> 19:43.500
Little toublemaker, huh?

19:57.208 --> 19:59.375
Stay calm.
Understand?

23:12.292 --> 23:15.292
Kyle, don't kill it!
Let it go!

23:19.208 --> 23:22.500
<i>Some people believe
that when you die...</i>

23:22.500 --> 23:24.583
<i>you return into
another form.</i>

23:25.667 --> 23:27.500
<i>What if I was gone?</i>

23:28.792 --> 23:31.875
You'll be in here forever.

24:01.167 --> 24:02.458
Shut up.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.125
Quiet!

25:16.875 --> 25:20.167
You can make your life easier
for the right price...

25:20.167 --> 25:21.875
understand?

25:28.875 --> 25:33.458
451!
We bring you a new cellmate.

25:36.042 --> 25:37.958
Better watch out.

25:38.750 --> 25:41.333
He killed his last three cellmates...

25:41.750 --> 25:44.667
but if you want to change cells...

25:45.333 --> 25:46.958
you let me know.

28:12.708 --> 28:15.208
Move!
Back to work!

28:40.583 --> 28:42.875
Grey's already back in Louisiana.

28:44.458 --> 28:48.583
Like you asked me.
Found a place, close to the water.

28:48.583 --> 28:50.542
Surrounded by trees.

28:50.542 --> 28:54.875
Thanks, Paul. Your sister
should rest in peace.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.458
How is it in here?

28:58.250 --> 29:02.250
Kyle, this is Russia.
You can pay them off.

29:33.125 --> 29:35.708
-Can't you control your animals?
-Get you pussy away from my man.

29:40.125 --> 29:41.625
Stay back!

29:46.625 --> 29:48.500
We have problem here?

29:51.708 --> 29:53.083
Not now!

29:54.417 --> 29:56.000
You want fight?

29:56.000 --> 29:58.583
Go to Sparka.
Understand?

30:05.375 --> 30:06.667
Move.

30:18.958 --> 30:20.875
That was scary, dude.

30:21.375 --> 30:23.250
-Kyle.
-Hey, I'm Billy.

30:25.083 --> 30:26.875
What are you in for?

30:28.583 --> 30:31.875
Tryin' to figure that out.
I was travellin' around...

30:32.958 --> 30:36.167
everyhting was great.
Then I met this girl and...

30:36.542 --> 30:38.167
we were drinking and...

30:38.167 --> 30:41.250
she crashed her
car into a restaurant.

30:42.333 --> 30:45.958
So they charged me
with gross negligence...

30:45.958 --> 30:49.458
to private property.
Got a fucking year and a half.

30:54.417 --> 30:56.417
How ya doin'?
Malakai.

30:57.042 --> 30:58.333
Kyle.

30:58.333 --> 31:03.125
I Have seen you Man in the Newspaper.You killed the
 fuckin' guy right outside the courtroom.

31:04.417 --> 31:06.833
Good for you, man.
He deserved it.

31:08.625 --> 31:11.625
The guy who threw
the ball at me. Who is he?

31:13.833 --> 31:15.125
Andrei.

31:16.625 --> 31:20.708
Russian mafia.
The guy next to him is their leader.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.625
Bolt. They got a deal with the
guards. They run the place.

31:25.625 --> 31:28.792
The rest of the gangs just
try to kill each other.

31:28.792 --> 31:30.417
It 's a regular party.

31:32.708 --> 31:36.708
The whole place is a fuckin'
war zone. lnside and out.

31:37.500 --> 31:41.208
Listen, man, anything you need...

31:41.208 --> 31:43.208
I'm the man to see.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.583
Okay?

31:45.583 --> 31:47.792
But this one I'll
give you for free.

31:51.875 --> 31:55.375
Pay the guard
and get yourself out...

31:56.292 --> 31:58.958
of that crazy motherfucker
nigger cell.

32:00.167 --> 32:03.083
Better start prayin', okay?

33:04.292 --> 33:06.125
Don't ever touch me again!

33:11.208 --> 33:13.708
The world's got
too much noise.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.375
And I've earned my peace and quiet,
and I expect it.

33:35.583 --> 33:40.458
You only got 18 months so let them
do what they want and get outta here.

33:40.458 --> 33:43.083
-How long you been in here?
-Six years.

33:43.750 --> 33:47.083
But I'm gonna get outta here.
This place ain't shit.

33:47.083 --> 33:50.875
He thinks he's a tough guy.
He's nothing but a small time.

33:51.250 --> 33:54.750
You wanna climb the wall?
Quit puttin' that shit in your arm.

33:55.042 --> 33:56.250
You sell it to me.

33:56.542 --> 33:58.833
I been sellin' shit
my whole life. It 's my job.

33:59.250 --> 34:03.042
I gotta roll before my wheels
get stuck in this bullshit.

34:05.042 --> 34:07.625
He's a little bitter and all,
being a gimp!

34:32.125 --> 34:34.625
You're tough.
I like that.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.500
I'll see you tonight.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.292
I want to change cells.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.792
America.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.000
Expensive.

35:13.167 --> 35:15.083
I'll call for more money.

35:15.583 --> 35:17.875
Until then, we wait.

35:49.958 --> 35:51.333
What is this?

35:51.333 --> 35:54.917
The inmates have problems.
This is the solution.

35:54.917 --> 35:57.750
Back home we have football.
Here it 's the Sparka.

35:57.750 --> 36:02.125
The guards set up the fights.
General Hruschov makes money...

36:02.125 --> 36:06.125
bettin' with his pig friends
and everybody's happy.

36:07.042 --> 36:10.125
Except the poor schmuck who
gets his head bashed in.

36:10.125 --> 36:13.208
Motherfuckers, am I late?
I'll take all your action.

36:13.708 --> 36:17.125
I'll bet you two packs on Andrei.

36:17.833 --> 36:19.000
Step back.

36:27.917 --> 36:31.708
Ladies and gentlemen,
on the right...

36:32.208 --> 36:34.417
is the one that is always after me.

36:34.417 --> 36:37.083
On the left is the one
that 's always after him.

36:37.083 --> 36:40.583
I've always dreamed of having
them both together.

36:40.583 --> 36:44.875
Well, I finally do!
I am stuck in the middle!

36:50.500 --> 36:54.458
Now they will break my heart!
They'll hurt each other.

36:59.667 --> 37:03.667
It 's time for blood,
sweat, tears! Boys...

37:03.958 --> 37:07.958
show me how you love me!
Go, fuck yourselves!

38:31.792 --> 38:33.083
Jesus!

38:42.167 --> 38:43.375
Stop!

39:03.250 --> 39:04.667
Does he fight?

39:05.167 --> 39:08.333
He refused.
One reason he's still alive...

39:08.333 --> 39:12.250
the guards make a lotta money
puttin' inmates in his cell.

39:12.250 --> 39:15.417
Just gets rid of those
they don't like.

39:38.708 --> 39:40.292
-Stay away from me!
-Drop it.

39:41.625 --> 39:42.792
Drop it!

39:53.292 --> 39:55.083
Take him to infirmary.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.500
Hey, ''suka'', you're in my way.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.167
Sorry.

40:12.458 --> 40:14.958
-What 's the point?
-I want no trouble.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.583
He disrespected us.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.292
Get your respect.

40:59.417 --> 41:00.917
Stop!

41:07.917 --> 41:09.542
Not necessary.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.917
I hope everything's resolved.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.292
This is not America.
Don't be hero.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.583
Take him back to the hole.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.000
Everybody back to work!

42:21.958 --> 42:23.333
<i>Grey.</i>

42:56.917 --> 42:58.708
Long time no see.

43:01.792 --> 43:02.917

44:12.542 --> 44:16.917
<i>...seven foot, a hundred
and thlrty kllos. Mllos...</i>

44:21.833 --> 44:24.542
Your break is over.
Let 's go.

44:54.792 --> 44:58.792
I'm going to make you
my favorite ''suka''.

44:59.708 --> 45:01.875
We're going to take turns.

45:05.167 --> 45:08.167
Don't start,
or I'll put you both in hole!

45:11.667 --> 45:13.375
You're dead.

45:18.875 --> 45:20.167
Ready?

45:28.250 --> 45:31.667
What 's up, man?
You okay?

46:07.708 --> 46:08.917
Gotta go.

46:09.417 --> 46:10.917
Come on, man!

46:37.583 --> 46:43.000
<i>''Hate gives me strength.
Even when there's no hope.</i>

46:45.000 --> 46:48.167

Hate'll makes things right.</i>

46:49.500 --> 46:52.875
<i>Shit, hate keeps me alive.''</i>

47:32.125 --> 47:33.542
Nice to see you again.

47:44.625 --> 47:46.333
I'll see you tonight.

48:03.292 --> 48:04.500
Where the fuck's he goin'?

48:10.792 --> 48:12.000
What?

48:44.250 --> 48:45.667
Stop!

48:48.667 --> 48:50.042
You American.

48:50.375 --> 48:53.958
You are going inside for long,
long time.

48:59.042 --> 49:02.542
<i>When shit hits the fan,
we all look for God...</i>

49:03.333 --> 49:06.958
<i>but by then it's usually too late.</i>

49:23.417 --> 49:25.208
<i>When He doesn't show up...</i>

49:25.917 --> 49:29.833
<i>it's up to you to deal with
your own miserable life.</i>

49:39.417 --> 49:40.792
What is it?

49:41.208 --> 49:43.500
-We hit a mine.
-Stay back!

49:48.500 --> 49:49.917
Stop them.

50:09.792 --> 50:11.500
Go, go! Come on!

50:11.875 --> 50:14.083
Escape!

50:15.292 --> 50:16.667
Line up!

50:18.583 --> 50:19.667
Check out!

50:36.750 --> 50:40.458
<i>We all have our way of dealin'.
Some choose to run.</i>

50:41.833 --> 50:43.958
<i>Others stay and fight.</i>

51:28.083 --> 51:31.583
We lost money because you...
two hours late.

51:48.292 --> 51:51.792
I should throw you in the hole.
I give you chance.

51:52.375 --> 51:55.667
You're more useful to me
as a bitch, understand?

51:56.875 --> 51:58.083
Take him.

52:07.167 --> 52:10.042
Please! No!

52:30.458 --> 52:33.125
<i>Is it a sin when you
reach your limit?</i>

52:38.125 --> 52:40.625
<i>When you've taken
your last steps.</i>

52:42.542 --> 52:45.417
<i>When you can go no more.</i>

52:52.000 --> 52:55.417
<i>You find that dark
place deep inside.</i>

52:56.708 --> 52:59.000
<i>Forget the world
you come from.</i>

52:59.917 --> 53:02.125
<i>Embrace the world you're in.</i>

53:17.708 --> 53:19.708
He's ready for the Sparka.

53:48.875 --> 53:51.958
I love you.
And I love you all!

53:52.375 --> 53:53.958
-Kick his ass.
-Place your bets!

53:53.958 --> 53:58.042
Hold on to your panties,
the party is about to begin!

54:02.750 --> 54:04.958
I give you twenty to one on Andrei.

54:04.958 --> 54:07.125
No way this American can win.

55:19.458 --> 55:20.875
Beat the shit out of him!

55:29.667 --> 55:30.750
Come on!

55:40.333 --> 55:41.458
Come on!

56:08.708 --> 56:09.708
Come on, Kyle!

57:56.208 --> 57:57.500
Feels good...

57:58.917 --> 58:00.000
doesn't it?

58:57.250 --> 58:59.333
Your American is very, very good.

58:59.333 --> 59:01.542
Bring the best men
from your prison.

59:01.542 --> 59:04.333
I'll give you a chance to
win back your money.

59:46.500 --> 59:47.917
Finish him.

59:48.292 --> 59:49.792
Finish him!

01:00:15.167 --> 01:00:16.875
<i>You think you're a winner.</i>

01:00:18.292 --> 01:00:21.458
<i>When you bend to play their
game, you're a loser.</i>

01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:26.167
<i>You lost yourself.</i>

01:00:31.958 --> 01:00:33.958
He's really fucked up.

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:59.750
What are you looking at?

01:01:01.917 --> 01:01:04.417
Do you even know who you are?

01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:08.333
Probably not.

01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:19.500
Christ!

01:01:20.792 --> 01:01:22.417
I'm sorry.

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:24.917
Must be tough in here.

01:01:25.625 --> 01:01:27.292
Everything's gettin better.

01:01:27.792 --> 01:01:29.792
I spoke to the Ambassador.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:32.708
-He's gonna talk to the...
-Forget it!

01:01:33.417 --> 01:01:34.583
What?

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:37.083
Don't give me hope.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.083
Nothing will change.

01:01:41.292 --> 01:01:43.083
Forget me.

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:14.042
Bolt cutters are where
they supposed to be.

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:42.042
You didn't learn from last time?

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:44.625
I'd rather die than play the bitch.

01:02:44.917 --> 01:02:47.625
Happy Russian Independence Day.
Send you a postcard.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.583
So you are the American.
I am Valya.

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:17.292
Valya!

01:03:17.292 --> 01:03:20.708
Warden told us no trouble today.

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:30.667
Come on.

01:03:33.083 --> 01:03:36.667
That 's the guy they transferred
from the other jail to fight you.

01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:46.583
Russian Independence Day
is a celebration of liberation.

01:03:46.958 --> 01:03:49.958
Pull up your skirt.
Here comes a sea of shit.

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:53.458
As a family with one common goal...

01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:57.542
the rehabilitation of ourselves
and... our communities.

01:04:23.708 --> 01:04:26.833
Kravavi will be reborn.
Together...

01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:29.833
we will rise to new heights.
Together...

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:32.417
we will embrace our future!

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:35.333
Future!

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:41.625
<i>The volce of authority should
be the voice of reason.</i>

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.792
<i>Supposed to set examples, teach us.</i>

01:04:45.208 --> 01:04:47.417
<i>And I have learned is all just...</i>

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.708
<i>bullshit to keep us down.</i>

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.583
There is no escape.

01:05:14.083 --> 01:05:16.792
I don't want to ruin
you pretty face.

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.375
But you just got more
time added on.

01:05:22.083 --> 01:05:26.375
How long, is up to me.
Serve your time.

01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:28.958
My little bitch.

01:05:51.042 --> 01:05:52.417
Your payment.

01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:54.833
How's Billy?

01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:58.417
Go easy on him.
It 's just a kid.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.917
<i>Malakai set Billy up. I guess
everybody has their price.</i>

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.208
Get out!

01:06:37.208 --> 01:06:40.375
<i>After a while you don't
feel the steady prick.</i>

01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:45.667
<i>You grow numb to it.
Forget about...</i>

01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:51.167
<i>what was, worry about
what is. But no...</i>

01:06:51.458 --> 01:06:56.458
<i>not me. I can't forget.
I can't forgive.</i>

01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:48.125
Get out.

01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:55.833
Take him to infirmary.

01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:11.500
He tried to make me kiss him.

01:08:11.792 --> 01:08:13.417
I spit in his face.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.500
He couldn't break me.

01:08:22.582 --> 01:08:23.582
Kyle...

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.292
don't let them turn you into
something you're not.

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:55.667
<i>He finally escaped...</i>

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:57.957
<i>but in a different way.</i>

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:32.625
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:09:45.792 --> 01:09:47.000
What 's he doin'?

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:58.375
Get up!

01:09:58.792 --> 01:10:00.375
Fight!

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:07.167
-Fight!
-Fight!

01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:37.833
Get up!

01:10:38.333 --> 01:10:40.167
Fight!

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:51.458
Tolik, what the hell is going on?

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:54.042
<i>-I don't know, sir.
-Well, find out.</i>

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:59.750
You better fight or
suffer consequences.

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:02.917
I won't play your game anymore.

01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:06.333
He won't fight, general.

01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:08.625
Get him out of there and
start another fight.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.625
<i>-We'll deal with him later.
-Yes, sir.</i>

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:36.583
Let me know when
you're ready to fight.

01:12:28.042 --> 01:12:29.750
Who's that for?

01:12:30.542 --> 01:12:32.042
It 's for you.

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:35.917
From Billy.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:53.917
How could you betray your friend?
You got a big mouth.

01:12:54.625 --> 01:12:56.417
Look at me.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I said look at me!

01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:02.292
Even if I get out of this place...

01:13:03.417 --> 01:13:06.000
I'm in a goddamn chair
for the rest of my life!

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.792
I piss, I shit all over myself.
I got sores all over my body.

01:13:10.792 --> 01:13:13.000
I need special things.

01:13:13.417 --> 01:13:15.000
They told me...

01:13:15.292 --> 01:13:18.292
they promised me, if I get my
eyes and my ears opened...

01:13:18.292 --> 01:13:19.792
they would take care of me.

01:13:20.583 --> 01:13:23.083
I didn't want them
to kill Billy.

01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:25.875
I swear to God, man.

01:13:26.167 --> 01:13:28.083
I'm just tryin' to survive.

01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:44.167
I gotta get outta this
fuckin' place. Please...

01:13:44.667 --> 01:13:45.958
help me.

01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:04.542
<i>I've been here over half my life.
I try to forget how I get here.</i>

01:14:05.833 --> 01:14:07.958
''...and took a great delight,
it did it like...''

01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:14.250
<i>When you're a kid you want to
believe what grown ups tell you.</i>

01:14:14.833 --> 01:14:16.333
<i>What's right.</i>

01:14:16.333 --> 01:14:17.917
<i>What's wrong.</i>

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.208
Perfection.

01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:28.500
<i>The stroking, the pettig,
all the lis of...</i>

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.417
<i>love and concern.
I finally realized...</i>

01:14:33.833 --> 01:14:37.792
<i>the temperature was four
hundred and fifty one degrees.</i>

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:42.000
<i>It was all a dirty shame.</i>

01:14:42.917 --> 01:14:46.500
<i>Like my burn mark.
It stays forever.</i>

01:15:08.667 --> 01:15:11.167
Your American, he has heart.

01:15:11.458 --> 01:15:13.875
He's a idiot.
He should've fought.

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:17.375
He's fighting.

01:15:17.792 --> 01:15:19.167
For himself.

01:15:29.042 --> 01:15:31.542
-What do you want?
-Peace.

01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:34.750
Bullshit.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:39.167
Take a good look.

01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:44.833
-He is a dead man.
-With his death...

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.833
only he wins.

01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:54.542
Together, we could all win.

01:15:55.917 --> 01:15:58.125
I want the fight. Now!

01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:06.333
Victor!

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.125
Bring me Valya.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.917
That is suicide.

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:22.625
The others gangs are united.
We cannot fight them all.

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.417
No one will fight.

01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:36.500
<i>Unity of people can bring
down any system.</i>

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:41.208
<i>Their power was gone.
They couldn't punish everyone.</i>

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:21.542
-Where have you been?
-When you forgot yourself...

01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:23.750
you forgot me.

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:30.125
-You've lost everything.
-Grey...

01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:35.833
In my opinion...

01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:38.042
we bring him to the fields
and shoot him.

01:17:38.042 --> 01:17:41.042
If we kill him we turn
him into a martyr.

01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:48.208
We must destroy his mystique
in front of everyone once and for all.

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:01.708
Keep your faith.

01:18:03.708 --> 01:18:05.000
<i>Without evil...</i>

01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:08.292
<i>we would never
recognize the good.</i>

01:18:19.792 --> 01:18:21.000
Grey...

01:18:21.292 --> 01:18:22.583
You're back.

01:18:23.875 --> 01:18:25.792
You made me so happy.

01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:30.083
-I miss you.
-Nobody has ever gone...

01:18:30.083 --> 01:18:32.583
as long as there's someone
to remember them.

01:19:01.458 --> 01:19:02.958
It 's your time.

01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:11.917
Lately we are having a huge
problem in Kravavi.

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:15.125
Authority is being
challenged.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:19.333
Order is not being respected.
This is unforgivable.

01:19:19.833 --> 01:19:22.708
Tonight, I will show
you the consequences...

01:19:22.708 --> 01:19:24.708
of this kind of
disobedience!

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:34.500
All I want is one fight.

01:19:35.208 --> 01:19:36.792
I will get it.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.500
Meet Milos.

01:21:31.583 --> 01:21:33.375
Continue to fight.

01:21:34.375 --> 01:21:36.708
Kill me!

01:21:38.708 --> 01:21:40.208
I won't fight anymore.

01:21:59.583 --> 01:22:01.583
Do it! Come on shoot me!

01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:28.208
People say one thing but they do
another. It 's all just bullshit.

01:24:29.625 --> 01:24:32.500
Everyone I killed in here
talked too much.

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.917
Don't waste words.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Just best not
to say a thing.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.625
Look here, shut up.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:50.792
Gotta get out of here.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.000
Someone killed my wife.

01:24:55.583 --> 01:24:58.500
I became a beast.
I lost myself.

01:24:59.583 --> 01:25:01.167
I lost her too.

01:25:02.083 --> 01:25:04.083
I don't want to
lose her again.

01:25:06.583 --> 01:25:08.500
I can get you out.

01:25:23.875 --> 01:25:26.875
I have every death and every
murder that 's happened in here...

01:25:26.875 --> 01:25:30.042
for the last twenty some years.

01:25:30.958 --> 01:25:33.667
Somebody out there
has to care.

01:25:34.833 --> 01:25:36.833
You need more fight.

01:25:42.167 --> 01:25:43.250
After the fight...

01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:46.333
they'll take you to a field and
shoot you. That 's their plan.

01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:51.417
-I won't fight anymore.
-My plan calls for one last fight.

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:06.625
<i>Seven inmates and one
guard died that night.</i>

01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:10.125
<i>It was the first time since
I can remember...</i>

01:26:10.125 --> 01:26:13.125
<i>that we weren't
fighting each other.</i>

01:26:14.917 --> 01:26:18.417
<i>We were under total lock-down
for two weeks.</i>

01:26:25.208 --> 01:26:29.000
I have to fight one more time,
so we can get out of here...

01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:32.792
...together.
-If he fights...

01:26:33.208 --> 01:26:35.083
he's no longer a martyr.

01:26:37.708 --> 01:26:40.000
Win or lose, get rid of him.

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:42.250
This is for Billy.

01:29:16.833 --> 01:29:18.125
Good luck.

01:29:25.042 --> 01:29:26.625
Put him in the back.

01:30:01.875 --> 01:30:04.292
Open up.
Come on.

01:30:21.167 --> 01:30:23.250
You're making big mistake.

01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:31.875
Sorry for the mistake.

01:30:40.667 --> 01:30:41.958
Here. Put this on.

01:30:42.833 --> 01:30:43.958
Damn!

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:49.833
This is General Eltzin's car.

01:30:50.542 --> 01:30:53.333
You drive right through the gate.
Nobody's gonna stop you.

01:30:57.542 --> 01:30:59.208
-You're coming with me, right?
-No.

01:30:59.208 --> 01:31:03.125
This is my home.
You got your part, I got mine.

01:31:11.417 --> 01:31:13.333
Make sure people know.

01:31:16.625 --> 01:31:19.125
Come on. Get outta here. Go.

01:31:50.167 --> 01:31:53.292
Next time,
I'm gonna get my money back.

01:31:53.292 --> 01:31:55.458
I'm looking forward to it.

01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:12.542
-General...
-You're not allowed in here!

01:32:19.458 --> 01:32:20.958
Get out!

01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:23.250
You talk too much.

01:32:38.542 --> 01:32:40.042
<i>Hello?</i>

01:32:40.625 --> 01:32:42.833
<i>What did you say
about the general?</i>

01:32:43.125 --> 01:32:45.417
<i>Hello? Who is it?</i>

01:33:03.708 --> 01:33:05.083
We did it...

01:33:05.417 --> 01:33:06.917
together.

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:14.292
<i>Most of us know the mask
we hide behind is bullshit.</i>

01:33:15.208 --> 01:33:17.500
<i>Sooner or later it shatters.</i>

01:33:18.375 --> 01:33:21.875
<i>That's when you find out
the man you really are.</i>

01:33:22.305 --> 01:33:28.196
