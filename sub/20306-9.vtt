00:01.001 --> 00:03.294
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.378 --> 00:07.215
On behalf of our dedicated associates
Anthony and Phillip Barletta,

00:07.298 --> 00:08.550
long live the Monarch.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.010
-(gunshots)
-He's been hit!

00:10.760 --> 00:12.595
-(grunts)
-I got the gun!

00:13.096 --> 00:14.889
Springer said he was hired
to kill the mayor

00:14.973 --> 00:16.975
by an ex-cop who called himself Fred.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.227
(machine-gun fire)

00:19.310 --> 00:20.437
Springer's been shot.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.354
Frank, am I at risk?

00:21.438 --> 00:23.606
There's no way for them to know
you had anything to do with Springer.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.359
We have your suitcase,
we have your weapon, and we have you.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.028
-You're going to Las Vegas tonight?
-Yup.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.405
I got to tell you,
I'm not that crazy about it.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.073
That's got to be from Leo.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.283
He's like a new man.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.244
-Thank you.
-(bell rings)

00:36.327 --> 00:38.747
-We got a problem here?
-He's playing with stolen money.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.833
I got this judge to sign some papers
that make me your guardian.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.922
-(overlapping conversations)
-Item three, Thanksgiving Day parade.

00:48.006 --> 00:51.301
This'll be duty downtown
out of a Division command post.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.303
Uh, check the board for your assignments.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.140
From what I'm told, the mayor is going
to be marching in the parade today,

00:57.348 --> 00:59.768
which, considering he was shot at
just yesterday,

00:59.851 --> 01:02.395
that, uh--
this individual shows me something.

01:02.854 --> 01:06.149
Uh, regarding the ongoing
investigation of that incident,

01:06.441 --> 01:09.319
uh, those of you who were in on it,
uh, you know the score.

01:10.153 --> 01:13.907
Uh, Division has asked
for a press blackout, okay?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.825
-Okay!
-(chuckling)

01:16.159 --> 01:21.331
Item four. On account of the holiday,
S.I.D. is emergency only.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.918
Uh, Victims' Aid is closed
for the long weekend.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.463
Uh, Mrs. Furillo asked me
to read the following.

01:29.130 --> 01:33.218
"Officers should inform any detainees
who are being released today

01:33.301 --> 01:34.969
"that they can get a free
Thanksgiving dinner

01:35.386 --> 01:38.181
"at any of the Friends of America
missions.

01:38.264 --> 01:41.226
The nearest one to this precinct
is 127 and Jerome."

01:41.309 --> 01:43.478
(indistinct murmurings)

01:43.561 --> 01:44.562
Item five.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.107
Uh...

01:50.610 --> 01:51.778
This is a personal matter.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.281
Now, for the last several days,
as many of you know,

01:55.365 --> 01:57.325
I've been receiving
telephone communications

01:57.408 --> 02:00.912
from a certain individual who--
who maybe is a little disturbed.

02:01.454 --> 02:05.250
Now, this matter is between myself
and the party in question, nobody else's.

02:06.584 --> 02:10.296
Now, today I come in and I find
that somebody's been leaving messages or--

02:10.755 --> 02:12.549
or calling the front desk
with some filthy stuff

02:12.924 --> 02:16.761
which even this individual,
in her lowest moment, would not stoop to.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.722
I don't know who's been doing it,
but I want you to know

02:20.223 --> 02:22.142
there's nothing funny
about this situation.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.602
I find out who's behind it,
we're gonna go at it.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.604
I don't care who,
I don't care where, that's it.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.818
Item six.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.116
Here's hoping you and yours
have a happy and a safe holiday.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.034
That'll do it.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.496
Let's get out there. Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.082
WOMAN: Have a good holiday, too, sir.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.089
I hope you plan on being there
exactly at 5:00,

02:53.173 --> 02:55.133
because Daryl Ann's
got this day worked out

02:55.216 --> 02:56.467
-like an airline schedule.
-We'll be there.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.179
First thing I'm gonna do
is watch the Lions-Packers.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.015
Then we're gonna eat ourselves
into a turkey torpor,

03:02.098 --> 03:03.349
and then put the baby to bed

03:03.433 --> 03:06.060
just in time to watch the rerun
of <i>The Osmonds Go To Plymouth.</i>

03:06.144 --> 03:06.978
Osmonds?

03:07.061 --> 03:08.479
-She loves the Osmonds.
-I hate the Osmonds.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.190
Well, I like 'em, and it's my house.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.109
-Frank?
-Happy Thanksgiving, Henry.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.485
Uh, thanks. Listen...

03:19.032 --> 03:20.533
Jerry Fuchs died about an hour ago.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.910
Hospital just called.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.620
Coronary.

03:24.370 --> 03:27.332
Not to squelch an appropriate
period of grieving,

03:27.415 --> 03:29.876
but he was our best witness
in the Cleveland case.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.921
Well, chief's coming in around 10:00.
We're going to talk about it.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.423
I mean, I just hope this doesn't put
the weight back on Joyce.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.176
It shouldn't. It won't.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.262
-Sarge?
-What?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.889
Just got another call for you.

03:44.599 --> 03:45.808
What is this?
They don't leave a name,

03:45.892 --> 03:47.769
and all they say is "ha, ha, ha"?

03:47.852 --> 03:52.190
No, the message was... (breathing heavily)

03:53.816 --> 03:56.319
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:56.736 --> 03:58.404
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:58.488 --> 04:02.242
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:02.325 --> 04:03.993
(sirens wailing)

04:09.457 --> 04:12.085
(theme music playing)

05:23.156 --> 05:24.949
That moron. That twerp.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.368
That hangdog, shuffling,
little mediocrity.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.121
-Chief?
-Fuchs, Jerry Fuchs.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.081
-Now he's croaked?
-Seems so.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.667
The one time in his life he does
something with some guts.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.294
You mean murder Terry Springer?

05:36.461 --> 05:38.338
So he stepped in a jackpot.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.758
At least he could've stayed alive
long enough to testify,

05:42.008 --> 05:43.926
give a deposition, some damned thing.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.095
-Where do we stand?
-On the Barlettas?

05:46.471 --> 05:48.806
Without Fuchs,
I'd say our best bet is Biff Lowe.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.934
Do we have anything to turn him?

05:52.226 --> 05:53.394
We could say Fuchs implicated him.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.064
He scared, I know that.
He has a stockbroker for a lawyer.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.607
Do it.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.196
Mayo, Garibaldi,

06:04.072 --> 06:05.907
let's get Thomas Lowe
in here for questioning.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.201
-The Biffer. Let's go.
-Yes.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.412
Captain? Sy Beckman,
Beckman Universal Travel.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.331
Mr. Beckman.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.167
Uh, your detectives LaRue and Washington
recovered tickets

06:16.250 --> 06:18.294
that got stolen from my agency
a couple days ago.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.796
-Glad they could help.
-So was I.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.632
I was so glad, I gave them a deal
on some airfares,

06:22.715 --> 06:26.803
which Detective LaRue showed his gratitude
by paying me off on the Firestone layaway.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.680
-He bounced a check?
-Six round trips to Las Vegas.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.140
I'm sure it was unintentional.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.850
Oh, oversights happen, Captain.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.436
But you pay off Beckman
with overdrawn paper,

06:35.520 --> 06:37.188
Beckman pulls the return on your ticket.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.690
And if your guys find another way back,

06:39.899 --> 06:41.275
ask Detective LaRue
to get in touch with me.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.485
I'll have him call you first thing.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.613
Our sick cops were convalescing
in Las Vegas.

06:45.696 --> 06:46.531
Is that so?

06:47.198 --> 06:49.033
Get a message to them through Mick.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.536
Tell them I want to see them
as soon as they land.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.414
Will do. Vegas, there's one bug
I never caught.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.999
-Just try to reach Mick, huh?
-Will do.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.585
Captain, this Horvath woman,
she's not letting up.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.170
Uh, have you been able to talk
to Division?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.839
-I have a call in.
-I appreciate it.

07:02.922 --> 07:03.756
Don't want to bother you.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.101
Oh, Raymondo,
would you happen to have room

07:15.184 --> 07:16.894
in your travel bag for my slippers?

07:16.978 --> 07:18.271
I'm afraid not, Howard.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.441
-Good morning, Mick.
-Where the hell's all the towels?

07:21.774 --> 07:22.859
(knock on door)

07:25.570 --> 07:26.487
(bag zips)

07:27.655 --> 07:29.615
-Good morning, Joseph.
-Lieutenant.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.243
Good morning, Joe.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.914
-Can I talk to you a second, Mick?
-We got nothing to talk about.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.333
Why don't we wait for you downstairs?

07:42.837 --> 07:46.090
I thought we'd leave
for the airport about 0800.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.344
(door closes)

07:52.555 --> 07:53.514
Hey, would you look at me?

07:56.184 --> 07:57.810
Come on, Mick.
We know each other a long time.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.103
I don't know you at all.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.857
Hey-- w-what are you, so perfect

08:03.316 --> 08:05.151
that you never went off
the deep end just a little bit?

08:05.234 --> 08:06.277
I was never a thief.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.570
I'm not a thief!

08:08.696 --> 08:10.740
I'm just somebody who went a little nuts,

08:11.616 --> 08:13.784
somebody who-- who tapped out
all of his plastic

08:13.868 --> 08:16.120
and decided just to take
your money without asking,

08:17.288 --> 08:18.956
and somebody that doesn't know
how long it's gonna take,

08:19.040 --> 08:21.417
but-- but who's gonna pay you back
if it kills him.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.254
Honest to God, Mick, I'm sorry.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.928
Well, at least it's no food
out of anybody's mouth.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.723
Maybe you'd better go pack.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.774
(indistinct conversations)

08:45.983 --> 08:47.068
Hey, hi, you guys.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.569
-Good morning, gentlemen.
-You okay? Lieutenant.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.239
Myrna?

08:52.448 --> 08:55.868
Mrs. Schnitz, are you all right?

08:58.246 --> 09:00.039
No, Lieutenant, I'm not all right.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.416
I was lying through my teeth yesterday.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.584
I'm broke.

09:03.668 --> 09:07.338
My boyfriend took a powder on me,
I'm so homesick I could bust,

09:07.964 --> 09:10.341
and then I read this sweet guy's letter.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.594
I have a little over 70 dollars.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.472
I thought if you could lend me the rest,
I'd fly home with you.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.641
Well, uh, Myrna...

09:19.684 --> 09:22.812
I'm sorry, but the fickle instruments
of chance have, uh...

09:23.604 --> 09:24.855
Would 20 dollars help?

09:24.939 --> 09:27.567
I-I could wire you the money
as soon as I get home.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.695
You guys got your room keys?

09:32.822 --> 09:34.907
-Hello, Mrs. Schnitz.
-Hi, Mick.

09:34.991 --> 09:35.908
Here you go.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.077
Hey, listen, uh, we made a couple calls.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.912
-Pay me later.
-Here.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.422
-Uh, Belker checking out of 306 and 307.
-(beeping)

09:49.672 --> 09:51.340
Those rooms are comped, Mr. Belker.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.718
I show three dollars and 20 cents
for the phone calls.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.640
(indistinct conversations)

10:01.809 --> 10:03.394
-I'll have your receipt in just a--
-Forget it.

10:06.647 --> 10:07.940
What's going on with Coffey?

10:08.024 --> 10:09.900
Uh, Joe just sold his plane ticket
to Myrna,

10:09.984 --> 10:12.153
-said he'd catch a later flight.
-MYRNA: Is that okay?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.364
Uh, I'll see you guys at the airport.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.907
(indistinct chattering)

10:17.450 --> 10:18.284
Come on, seven!

10:18.993 --> 10:20.036
Eleven a winner.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.287
DEALER: Front line win eleven.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.706
Eleven's good enough. Eleven will do.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.583
Eleven a winner. Pay to line.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.418
MAN: Play the field. Play the field.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.923
DEALER: Now we got a shooter, folks.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.635
Stay away from me, Mick.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.846
DEALER: Come on out.
Same good shooter now.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.182
-All right. Shoot to 70.
-DEALER: Go get 'em, sir.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.351
Come on, seven!

10:44.018 --> 10:47.396
Six-- six a point.
Who wants the hard way now?

10:48.064 --> 10:49.815
All right, give me, uh, all the numbers.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.570
COFFEY: What are you doing here?
You're bothering me. Get lost.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.908
See, I get the feeling
that if you don't come home with us,

10:59.533 --> 11:01.118
I don't know when you're gonna come home.

11:02.244 --> 11:05.665
So I'm just gonna stand here
and wait for you.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.043
DEALER: Are you shooting, sir?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.005
Come on, six!

11:21.263 --> 11:22.515
This is Mr. Lowe.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.059
-Interrogation.
-Come on.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.781
This is Deep Throat here,
in disguise to protect myself

11:38.864 --> 11:40.825
from those evil Barletta brothers.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.743
I promised you you're not a witness.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.246
I heard about Jerry Fuchs.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.373
Captain, Thomas Lowe, Interrogation.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.582
That's our bait, not you.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.127
-Sarge?
-Huh?

11:51.711 --> 11:52.962
Another message.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.131
-Breathin'?
-No, speaking.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.675
She says she's coming up to see you.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.553
-No.
-That's what she says.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.477
THOMAS: Captain,
this had better be damned good.

12:08.561 --> 12:12.815
Of all the cheap, bottom-drawer theatrics
to pull me out

12:12.898 --> 12:14.734
right in front of my family,

12:15.234 --> 12:16.402
-my mother--
-Save it, Biff.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.780
On the subject of Anthony
and Phillip Barletta

12:19.864 --> 12:23.868
and the Monarch Redevelopment,
I said all I had to say yesterday.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.995
Then listen.
Jerry Fuchs died this morning,

12:26.078 --> 12:27.955
but not before naming you
and the Barlettas.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.332
Naming me in what damn thing?

12:30.416 --> 12:32.418
For the attempted murder
of Mayor Cleveland

12:32.501 --> 12:34.003
and the murder of Terry Springer.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.423
You've got bats in your attic, Captain.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.470
I don't even know who a Jerry Fuchs is.
I've never met the gentleman.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.764
-FRANK: Know Joe Keenan?
-Who?

12:45.473 --> 12:47.391
You're appalling. Book him.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.518
Book me? Book me for what?

12:50.895 --> 12:55.524
To put me in a-- in a city jail
rampant with rats and homosexuality?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.611
Help us against the Barlettas,
and we'll get you a bail you can make.

12:58.986 --> 13:02.573
Oh, is that how you coerce
your confessions, Captain?

13:02.907 --> 13:05.743
To put a man among
hardened criminals to be raped?

13:06.076 --> 13:08.370
That is a civil suit, Captain.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.791
Even the threat of that is a civil suit.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.876
Corrections isn't my department,
Counselor.

13:15.836 --> 13:16.962
(whispering)

13:21.550 --> 13:22.635
Now-- now...

13:24.970 --> 13:28.057
With-without admitting one damn thing,

13:29.642 --> 13:33.771
how could I, uh, do my citizen's duty?

13:35.439 --> 13:36.357
Wear a wire.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.068
Provide us with taped conversations

13:39.151 --> 13:41.445
in which the Barlettas confess
to the plot against Cleveland.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.614
-We want full immunity.
-Too much.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.909
Immunity from incriminations
when you wear the wire, that's it.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.579
Plus the bail, a reasonable bail.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.459
And I want time to explain
all this to my family, to Mommy.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.420
Oh, this is bloody awful.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.588
Set him up, Harry.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.391
-(woman talking indistinctly on radio)
-Let me see.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.643
Now, there's gonna be
Daryl Ann's mama and daddy

14:12.726 --> 14:14.562
-and her aunt and uncle from Chesterfield.
-Mm-hmm.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.064
And her two cousins-- Wait till you
eyeball some of these people.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.108
Ooh! Sounds like a night to remember.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.901
Yeah. They're even gonna
bring out the old uncle

14:20.985 --> 14:23.279
who got shell-shocked
at the Bataan Death March.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.780
You mean the one who stands outside

14:24.864 --> 14:26.240
-pushing a rake?
-Yeah.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.034
WOMAN (over radio)
<i>All units in the city. Dekker and 135th.</i>

14:29.118 --> 14:31.662
<i>Man creating a disturbance,</i>
<i>menacing a school vehicle.</i>

14:31.745 --> 14:32.746
<i>Respond.</i>

14:33.038 --> 14:36.584
-2202 in response.
-The one with the rake? (laughs)

14:39.169 --> 14:41.422
(siren wailing)

14:46.719 --> 14:48.846
He shot arrows at our tires.

14:51.432 --> 14:55.060
-Will you look at this? What is this?
-(horn honks)

14:55.144 --> 14:56.937
-Everybody okay?
-I think so.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.356
-He's right up the street.
-(motorcycle engine revving)

15:00.190 --> 15:01.108
Let's go, Renko.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.490
(siren wailing)

15:08.574 --> 15:12.286
RENKO: 2202 in pursuit of an individual
on a motor-driven bike

15:12.369 --> 15:14.246
north on 135.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.666
He's wearing a-an Indian get-up.
Turn left in here.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.920
-(sirens wailing)
-(man whooping)

15:23.672 --> 15:25.007
BOBBY: There goes the shocks, buddy.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.010
MAN: Ah! (shouting indistinctly)

15:32.389 --> 15:33.641
RENKO: I hate this holiday.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.684
-Hey!
-(man shouting indistinctly)

15:35.768 --> 15:36.977
Get off the bike!

15:40.773 --> 15:41.857
He's going that way. Cut across.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.108
-Cut across on him.
-I got it, I got it.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.402
(whooping)

15:46.028 --> 15:46.946
RENKO: Hey, pal!

15:47.029 --> 15:49.698
Okay, pal, get off that bike right now!
Get off of it!

15:49.782 --> 15:52.034
You're gonna run into the wall here
and kill somebody!

15:52.368 --> 15:53.953
I want you to get off that bike right now!

15:54.036 --> 15:55.788
I demand you get off that bike!

15:56.747 --> 15:59.166
(siren wailing)

15:59.249 --> 16:01.669
You get off that bike
or I'm gonna run you down, bud!

16:03.045 --> 16:04.296
RENKO: Get alongside of him!

16:04.380 --> 16:06.131
-Get alongside of him!
-BOBBY: What're you gonna do?

16:06.215 --> 16:08.050
(grunts) Fly, Thunderbolt!

16:08.133 --> 16:10.135
Be swift like a deer!

16:11.887 --> 16:13.013
-(man whooping continues)
-Hey!

16:13.097 --> 16:15.849
RENKO: That's it for you, pal!
That's it! That's all!

16:15.933 --> 16:17.768
All right, I'm gonna pull over
to the side!

16:17.851 --> 16:20.104
You pull over right now.
Bobby, pull this thing over!

16:20.187 --> 16:21.939
Pull it over here! Pull it over!

16:22.147 --> 16:23.899
-Now, Mr. Cochise...
-What?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.276
You are under arrest, pal!
Get off this bike right now!

16:26.360 --> 16:28.570
Get off of it! Get off the bike.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.906
Cochise, you have the right
to remain silent...

16:30.990 --> 16:32.199
Yes! Arrest me!

16:32.741 --> 16:36.912
-If you give up that right...
-Sure. Arrest me. Persecute me.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.415
Maybe to yourself you're Mr. Cochise,

16:39.498 --> 16:41.208
but to me and my partner,
you're just a hop!

16:41.291 --> 16:42.292
-...court of law.
-Do you understand that?

16:42.376 --> 16:43.836
Hey, mister, you really an Indian?

16:44.211 --> 16:46.672
Run, children. Run to your houses.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.465
...a court will appoint one for--

16:48.549 --> 16:50.009
-Oh, the bow!
-What?

16:50.092 --> 16:51.677
-The bow got me.
-Bow. Bow. Bow.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.053
I'm gonna call Daryl Ann.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.891
Studio publicist hands me a sheet,

16:57.975 --> 17:00.978
tells me, "Tomorrow you'll visit
such-and-such a school."

17:01.311 --> 17:05.024
I enjoy addressing our young people,
but usually she's there to prep me.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.317
I've represented you before.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.485
MAN: At Wounded Knee.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.405
I've been in all major demonstrations.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.075
As a movie star,
I'm able to galvanize public attention.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.538
The last time it was
Duncan Renaldo, the Cisco Kid.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.540
People frequently confuse me.

17:21.957 --> 17:22.833
I'm Jeff Chandler.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.544
Perhaps you saw my movie, <i>Broken Arrow.</i>

17:25.961 --> 17:26.920
No, no, no.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.506
The Cisco Kid, A.K.A. Jack Webb,

17:29.590 --> 17:32.968
A.K.A. Gale Storm,
real name, Alan Branford.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.970
You are so very beautiful.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.139
I would have thought
your last brush with the law

17:37.222 --> 17:40.142
would've put an end to these
impersonations, Mr. Branford.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.228
You remind me of Irene Dunne in <i>The Squaw.</i>

17:43.312 --> 17:45.064
Could we focus attention here?

17:47.024 --> 17:49.443
Firing arrows at a bus
loaded with children

17:49.526 --> 17:50.819
qualifies you for a felony.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.073
I did not fire at the whole bus,
only the tires.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.909
-Regardless--
-You must help me escape from here.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.161
I must ride in the parade.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.872
The parade is out. Look, Mr. Branford,

18:01.955 --> 18:03.499
you're conceivably facing a jail term

18:03.832 --> 18:06.085
on endangerment
and possession of a weapon.

18:08.879 --> 18:09.838
What do you want me to do?

18:11.173 --> 18:15.552
If you'll agree to reimburse the driver
for the loss of his tire,

18:15.636 --> 18:17.304
-he may decline to prosecute.
-That's no problem.

18:18.180 --> 18:22.309
I'd also like to petition the court
to arrange for psychiatric counseling.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.310
That will not be necessary.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.855
I'm already on a day pass
from the halfway house.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.398
They let you out?

18:29.775 --> 18:30.692
It's Thanksgiving.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.238
So we asked ourselves,
what would Jablo do?

18:35.072 --> 18:37.324
-Bus driver pressing charges?
-No.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.035
So you busted him,
you put the fear of God in him.

18:40.869 --> 18:41.703
Now let him out.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.789
Let him thank God
somebody's letting him go.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.833
Go home. Have your turkey.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.587
Miss Davenport, the sarge says
we're kicking this guy.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.257
You're a fortunate man, Mr. Branford.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.592
I, uh, I can go?

18:56.093 --> 18:58.971
That's right. Do not go to the parade.

18:59.888 --> 19:00.806
You've been so kind.

19:00.889 --> 19:02.683
Um, I wonder, uh...

19:04.226 --> 19:05.978
If I could invite you to...

19:07.563 --> 19:09.731
have, uh, Thanksgiving dinner with me.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.401
Thank you, but I plan to be
with my husband.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.946
-Perhaps another time.
-Thank you, though.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.824
You want a free feed, pal?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.618
Friends of America mission
on Jerome Avenue.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.122
Well, thank you. Uh, where is Thunderbolt?

19:33.422 --> 19:38.218
MEL TILLIS (recording):
<i>Hi, I'm-- I'm-- I am Mel...Tillis.</i>

19:38.760 --> 19:41.972
<i>I want you folks</i>
<i>to watch your children carefully</i>

19:42.639 --> 19:45.225
<i>and... and... </i>(stammering)

19:45.309 --> 19:46.935
What are you guys still doing here?

19:47.269 --> 19:49.646
J.D. paid the travel agent
with a rubber check.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.441
-I'm never gonna get out of this town!
-Now, now, Myrna.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.318
There's still over an hour left
before the next flight.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.195
LARUE: I'm gonna get this
straightened out!

19:56.528 --> 19:57.529
Just wire us the money.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.741
Any Western Union office.
They got one around here.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.534
Maybe I can help out with that, J.D.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.291
Oh, you sexy thing.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.878
Excuse me. Here's your coffee, sir.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.796
Thank you very much.

20:16.965 --> 20:19.301
-And a Coke.
-Thank you.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.761
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (over P.A.):
<i>Complimentary drinks include</i>

20:20.844 --> 20:24.681
<i>sparkling water, soft drinks,</i>
<i>orange or tomato juice,</i>

20:24.765 --> 20:26.600
<i>-coffee, tea, or milk...</i>
-(sighs)

20:26.683 --> 20:30.479
Hey, Mick, have you ever seen
anybody that hot on a craps table?

20:32.189 --> 20:33.815
I never saw craps before.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.070
You mean that's why you didn't get on me?

20:39.196 --> 20:40.030
What do you mean?

20:40.113 --> 20:42.366
I mean, I was throwing numbers
for an hour and a half.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.909
I mean, you never placed one bet.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.078
I didn't know you didn't know the game.

20:48.121 --> 20:50.165
I wasn't there to win money.
I was there to bring you home.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.708
RAY: I just figured it out, Howard.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.293
This is what I'm going to tell Rosa.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.672
I arrived in Austin.
I saw that my cousin was head of--

20:56.755 --> 20:59.424
Raymondo, you seem to dwell
in blissful ignorance

20:59.508 --> 21:01.093
that the telephone was ever invented.

21:01.176 --> 21:04.012
-Certainly Rosa can call your cousin.
-What would you do, Howard?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.473
I'd tell the truth
and face the consequences

21:06.556 --> 21:08.016
or think up a better alibi.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.226
I am trying.

21:09.851 --> 21:12.479
LARUE (scoffs): You believe
that travel agent?

21:12.562 --> 21:15.565
After we nearly break our backs
getting his tickets back for him.

21:15.649 --> 21:18.318
-Shouldn't have bounced the check, J.D.
-I did not bounce a check.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.987
There were insufficient funds.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.697
We paid you the dough, man.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.616
I was gonna put the money in the bank
the day we got back.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.077
That guy must've sprinted
over to my branch.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.203
Oh, God.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.247
What's the matter, Myrna?

21:30.330 --> 21:32.332
-I'm scared.
-LARUE: Scared of what?

21:32.958 --> 21:35.794
-That Leo won't want me back.
-Are you kidding?

21:36.169 --> 21:39.047
That guy was like an Olympic torchbearer.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.008
And how about that letter
he sent you, huh?

21:41.591 --> 21:44.928
I didn't read it, but it sure
smelled like he wanted you.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.806
I'm pregnant.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.394
Uh... hey, would anybody like some water?

21:52.477 --> 21:53.729
(sobs)

21:53.812 --> 21:54.896
CAPTAIN (over P.A.):
<i>If you look out your windows</i>

21:54.980 --> 21:56.606
<i>on the starboard side of the plane,</i>

21:56.898 --> 21:58.942
<i>you will see the great Salt Lake of Utah.</i>

21:59.401 --> 22:01.611
Judas. I wish these fellows would realize

22:01.695 --> 22:03.238
that we don't want them
to be tour directors

22:03.322 --> 22:04.740
and just fly the aircraft.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.368
<i>You might have noticed a little bump</i>
<i>as we got airborne back in Las Vegas.</i>

22:08.744 --> 22:12.331
<i>The Vegas tower informs us</i>
<i>we lost some rubber on one of our wheels.</i>

22:13.415 --> 22:16.710
<i>Now, we're not concerned about it,</i>
<i>but we are going to take the precautions</i>

22:16.793 --> 22:19.212
<i>for what's called</i>
<i>an "other-than-normal landing."</i>

22:19.504 --> 22:20.505
Uh-oh.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.924
(siren wailing)

22:29.097 --> 22:31.641
(indistinct voices over radio)

22:31.725 --> 22:33.185
Doghouse to Rover, he's in.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.188
I'm sorry. I, uh...

22:36.563 --> 22:39.149
I'm awfully sorry, but we have to talk.

22:40.734 --> 22:41.735
How about a shot of this?

22:49.743 --> 22:50.577
There.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.915
It's 107 proof.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.459
Seven years old.

22:58.085 --> 22:58.960
-(glass clinks)
<i>-Salud.</i>

23:02.255 --> 23:05.467
-(Lowe coughs)
-(chuckles) Like cream, huh?

23:06.343 --> 23:07.386
I love this stuff.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.556
They got Fuchs.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.433
Oh, brother.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.477
He had a heart attack at the airport.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.771
Keenan doesn't know how much he said.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.022
He died this morning.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.024
You know something, Tony?

23:21.525 --> 23:22.692
-You are stupid.
-Oh, come on.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.319
This was the stupidest damned thing.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.655
I said it from the beginning,
why shoot him?

23:26.905 --> 23:28.782
Why bring the crap down on all of us?

23:28.865 --> 23:30.617
So you pay the man a half a million bucks.

23:30.700 --> 23:31.910
-<i>Oh, shut up!</i>
-PHILLIP: <i>I won't shut up!</i>

23:32.327 --> 23:34.287
<i>You think Cleveland wouldn't</i>
<i>have moved for a half a million...</i>

23:34.371 --> 23:35.872
Doghouse to Rover, go.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.459
All right, police. Freeze.
Get your hands up.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.002
-You're busted.
-Nobody move. Nobody move.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.129
-PHILLIP: You got a warrant?
-Yeah.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.047
Hey, Biff, you been goofing with us here?

23:44.256 --> 23:47.050
You're dead if you did, man.
You're one dead goofball.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.261
-MAYO: Shut up.
-Oh, and what are you?

23:49.678 --> 23:52.472
You're street scum.
There, I said it and I'm glad.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.932
All right, Mr. Lowe,
let's get out of here.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.517
I hated doing business with you.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.477
I hated being in the same
restaurants with you.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.938
I hate your loud, vulgar talk.

24:00.021 --> 24:03.859
I hate your damn foods, too,
your pitiful excuse for red wine,

24:03.942 --> 24:05.902
your cuff links the size of golf balls.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.195
All right.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.786
Larceny of a gas credit card.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.872
Complainant's a john
who doesn't want to press.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.874
Also we found some of these works on her.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.377
-Residue of a controlled substance.
-Name.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.338
-Name, please.
-Uh, Sally.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.090
You said it was Vivian.

24:27.507 --> 24:28.717
She said it was Vivian DeWitt.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.802
I'll need an address, Ms. DeWitt.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.137
Ms. DeWitt?

24:32.679 --> 24:33.513
You'd better move her.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.474
Hold it just a second. Wait a minute.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.892
-Did you say DeWitt?
-Yeah.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.561
-Ms. DeWitt?
-Uh, yes.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.646
Do you have three children?

24:43.064 --> 24:45.192
-Do you have three children?
-What's that about?

24:45.275 --> 24:48.403
I'm asking you, three kids.
Do you have a son named Fabian?

24:49.029 --> 24:51.740
What those children gone and done now?

24:52.199 --> 24:54.576
As soon as she gets done being processed,
I want to talk to her.

24:54.659 --> 24:55.494
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

25:00.415 --> 25:03.585
My children are old
and grown now. (chuckles)

25:04.127 --> 25:07.756
Jackie and Sonya, they were wild ones.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.842
I never could get them to mind.

25:11.301 --> 25:15.305
But now, Fabian, that's my baby.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.265
Do you know where they are now?

25:18.225 --> 25:19.059
Um...

25:20.393 --> 25:21.811
My cousin told me...

25:23.104 --> 25:24.481
Jackie died...

25:25.440 --> 25:28.944
and she said Fabian's in a foster home.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.617
-Ms. DeWitt...
-Huh?

25:35.825 --> 25:37.118
Fabian is with me.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.121
-Say what?
-Fabian, he lives with me.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.709
How come he's living
with some cop now, huh?

25:45.794 --> 25:47.587
Because he didn't have a parent.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.382
Because I agreed to be a foster parent.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.717
You took my child?

25:53.218 --> 25:56.721
I didn't take your child.
You abandoned him.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.891
He was committing crimes.
He was gonna go to reform school.

26:01.309 --> 26:02.561
I was, uh...

26:03.353 --> 26:08.525
Gonna take 'em all down... North Carolina,

26:09.401 --> 26:11.111
me and my family.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.698
How long have you been an addict?

26:15.615 --> 26:17.075
Long time.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.827
Always been.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.624
How many days I'm gonna get?

26:26.543 --> 26:28.295
Complainant didn't press charges.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.130
You just had works.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.923
If you go in the detox program,

26:32.007 --> 26:36.052
you can probably get... probation.

26:37.887 --> 26:40.557
-Fabian don't take no drugs?
-BATES: No.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.396
How's he doing?

26:51.985 --> 26:53.612
He's fine. It's a little tough right now.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.948
Keep him home with you, then.

26:58.908 --> 27:00.827
I guess that'll be all right, then.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.373
Do you--

27:06.416 --> 27:08.126
Do you want me to tell him
that he can come see you?

27:11.838 --> 27:14.716
Just tell him, uh...

27:15.383 --> 27:17.052
be a good boy,

27:18.011 --> 27:19.888
and as soon as I'm right,

27:20.597 --> 27:24.100
I'm gonna come and see him real soon.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.394
Yeah.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.397
-Yeah...
-Okay.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.232
No, no.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.568
You know what?

27:36.446 --> 27:39.949
Don't even... tell him you saw me.

27:41.117 --> 27:41.993
No...

27:47.874 --> 27:51.044
-(siren wailing)
-(tires screeching)

27:59.969 --> 28:02.430
-(indistinct chattering)
-MAN: Please! Please listen to me!

28:02.514 --> 28:03.431
RENKO: What's going on, pal?

28:03.515 --> 28:04.766
Guy's in there in an Indian suit
causin' a ruckus.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.560
-What? What?
-Cochise. Cochise. Cochise. Let's go.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.899
Everyone, stop eating or the woman dies.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.193
-Listen to me!
-WOMAN: Would you let me go, please?

28:15.527 --> 28:19.614
All of us are Indians inside,
wild, proud, gentle.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.116
I do not want to hurt you.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.827
The Indian has lived in peace
for many moons.

28:23.910 --> 28:24.953
Mr. Cochise...

28:25.578 --> 28:26.454
Come no closer.

28:27.622 --> 28:29.624
Would you please tell him who I am?

28:29.708 --> 28:30.959
He thinks I'm Debra Paget.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.336
I have come to reclaim my wife.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.213
You will learn to ride bareback.

28:35.296 --> 28:37.507
Cochise, you're not taking
anybody anywhere.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.094
You take that tomahawk
and you put it down now, pal.

28:42.804 --> 28:44.806
Uh... it's only rubber.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.517
It's... the miracle of film.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.352
Rubber?

28:50.687 --> 28:51.563
(groans)

28:52.021 --> 28:53.648
(cheers and applause)

29:00.989 --> 29:02.949
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Those of you
who are unable to grab your ankles,

29:03.450 --> 29:06.911
fold your arms on the seat in front of you
and press your head against it.

29:08.121 --> 29:09.914
All sharp objects out
of your pockets, sir?

29:10.123 --> 29:13.001
Yeah. Uh... you nervous?

29:13.460 --> 29:14.335
A little.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.839
You think this is bad, you ought to try
a dogfight with a V.C. pilot.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.466
You flew jets in the war?

29:19.924 --> 29:22.051
Over 80 missions, and you can believe me
when I tell you

29:22.135 --> 29:25.263
that it's no tea party
when they shoot off your, uh, tail thing,

29:25.346 --> 29:27.599
you know, the flippers
on the back of the plane.

29:27.682 --> 29:28.975
You'll have to excuse me, sir.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.602
Wait. Wait just a minute.

29:31.102 --> 29:32.896
Okay, now, suppose we're gonna buy it.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.357
What do you think would be
the best possible thing to be doing

29:36.441 --> 29:37.525
when we check out?

29:38.234 --> 29:41.029
You've got no chance, sir-- zero.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.658
CAPTAIN (over P.A.):
<i>We're in our final approach now, folks.</i>

29:46.159 --> 29:49.204
<i>I would like to remind all you passengers</i>
<i>to stay in your seats...</i>

29:49.287 --> 29:50.497
You believe this, Mick?

29:50.830 --> 29:53.249
I come home from Vegas up 3,600,

29:53.583 --> 29:54.918
you got your five grand...

29:57.378 --> 29:58.254
Who's that to?

29:59.339 --> 30:00.632
I'm writing to Robin.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.845
(whistling)

30:05.929 --> 30:07.138
We're 50 feet from the ground.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.307
CAPTAIN (over P.A.): <i>I'm now going to ask</i>
<i>the flight attendants to take their seats,</i>

30:09.390 --> 30:10.308
(whistling)

30:10.391 --> 30:13.478
<i>and everyone get ready</i>
<i>to assume the position...</i>

30:13.561 --> 30:14.604
He's over water.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.858
-Over water.
-(whistling continues)

30:18.942 --> 30:21.444
-Over land.
-How about over runway?

30:21.528 --> 30:23.655
Let's assume the position,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:24.697 --> 30:25.907
Let's bend over...

30:27.534 --> 30:29.494
LARUE: And kiss our butts goodbye.

30:32.705 --> 30:35.834
Barlettas get conspiracy to commit murder.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.294
GARIBALDI: Add an attempted bribery
on the way over.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.255
I asked you how much you make!

30:40.338 --> 30:42.549
You asked us if we'd like
to double what we make.

30:42.882 --> 30:45.718
Lowe is charged with attempted bribery
of a public official.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.390
Barletta brothers.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.352
-The mayor.
-Something we can help you with, sir?

30:54.894 --> 30:57.230
I just wanted to look at the scum
that tried to have me killed.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.899
What happened to the
"innocent until convicted" here?

30:59.983 --> 31:02.402
You'll get your day in court, Phil.
This is just a bonus!

31:02.485 --> 31:03.570
-(grunts)
-FRANK: Easy. Easy.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.905
-Ozzie...
-You want some, Tony?

31:23.756 --> 31:24.799
They think you're meat.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.761
You're either part of their plan
or part of the problem.

31:36.644 --> 31:37.604
Pretty stupid, huh?

31:38.187 --> 31:39.522
Nobody likes being shot at.

31:45.778 --> 31:47.614
I heard they owned someone
in the Division.

31:47.697 --> 31:48.531
(knock on door)

31:49.949 --> 31:50.783
Oh?

31:51.618 --> 31:54.329
Frank, Biff Lowe tried to croak himself.

31:58.791 --> 32:00.084
He tried to eat his shirt.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.212
I feel wicked awful.

32:16.225 --> 32:17.060
Stan?

32:18.853 --> 32:21.856
-Hi.
-Vera, what do you want from me?

32:23.524 --> 32:25.735
I... I want to talk.

32:26.527 --> 32:27.403
Downstairs.

32:35.620 --> 32:39.123
(sighs) Okay, Vera, talk.

32:40.750 --> 32:41.626
I've, uh...

32:42.543 --> 32:44.212
I've had these troubles lately, Stan.

32:45.338 --> 32:49.926
And I-- what the doctor said
was that I have, uh...

32:50.760 --> 32:54.639
I have trouble expressing my feelings.

32:55.056 --> 32:58.768
And so I express them in a-- in a--

33:00.186 --> 33:01.980
-in a--
-Inappropriately.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.982
Inappropriate, thank you, ways.

33:04.065 --> 33:07.318
Like with you, like I have been,
you know, fighting and all.

33:07.944 --> 33:10.738
So what they said was
I should express my feelings.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.865
-That was in this therapy I had, you know?
-Uh-huh.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.538
I was always unlucky in love,

33:19.914 --> 33:21.749
and working close together like we were,

33:22.917 --> 33:24.794
when I began to feel
about you the way I did.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.755
I thought, "No, Vera, no.
Not never, not no how."

33:28.589 --> 33:31.300
But then, about two years ago,
I began to have some hope.

33:31.467 --> 33:32.301
Why was that?

33:32.760 --> 33:35.013
The Memorial Day picnic,
during the softball game,

33:35.096 --> 33:35.930
you came over and had a beer,

33:36.014 --> 33:38.057
-standing there under the grandstand.
-I did?

33:38.516 --> 33:39.767
It wasn't anything you said.

33:40.727 --> 33:41.978
It was what I felt from you.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.604
Now, Vera, wait, I--

33:43.688 --> 33:45.398
And then last year,
when my dad passed away,

33:45.481 --> 33:47.066
and you sent me that sweet note.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.444
Hey, your old man died,
so I bought you a card.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.362
That's right. And that was sweet.

33:51.612 --> 33:55.074
And I began to realize
that you were feeling what I was, Stan.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.285
But, you see, I-I...

33:57.994 --> 34:00.580
I... I could never express it right...

34:01.622 --> 34:03.624
'cause of my-- 'cause of my troubles.

34:04.792 --> 34:05.668
(sighs)

34:06.544 --> 34:07.754
So that's what I'm trying to do.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.758
I'm trying to tell you... I love you.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.510
And I'm feeling, maybe, pretty sure...

34:15.303 --> 34:16.471
that you love me, too.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.686
Doctors told you to do this?

34:24.479 --> 34:25.438
They urged me to.

34:26.064 --> 34:26.981
They insisted.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.735
Vera, I thought we hated each other.

34:30.818 --> 34:32.695
No, it was love-hate.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.613
See, that's what they told me--

34:33.696 --> 34:36.491
that there's a very thin line
between them.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.120
Vera, hold on. (stammers)
Hold on, there, a second.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.413
Let me ask you something.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.999
Uh, these doctors, if they're telling you
that you're well enough

34:45.083 --> 34:45.958
to say what you're saying,

34:46.042 --> 34:48.086
you must be well enough
to hear something from me.

34:48.544 --> 34:49.420
What?

34:50.254 --> 34:51.506
Do I love <i>you?</i>

34:52.340 --> 34:54.175
No. That's no.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.595
And I don't know how you could,
even for one second, think that, Vera.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.263
I don't mean to be unkind,

34:59.806 --> 35:03.476
but to be even talking this way
strikes me as being completely zooey.

35:03.976 --> 35:04.852
But can we talk about it?

35:04.936 --> 35:06.813
Yeah, we can talk about it
from now till next Tuesday.

35:06.896 --> 35:09.482
It isn't gonna do any good.
It's a mistake.

35:10.149 --> 35:13.402
It is a misunderstanding, Vera,
somehow, on your part.

35:13.486 --> 35:16.322
I-- that's all there is to say.

35:16.906 --> 35:17.782
I'm sorry.

35:19.075 --> 35:21.661
I guess, in the back of my mind,
I kind of expected this.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.498
I'm glad to hear you say that.

35:30.962 --> 35:31.879
Oh, well.

35:36.717 --> 35:37.635
So, um...

35:39.887 --> 35:41.848
you're gonna be having dinner
with your-- with your family?

35:44.100 --> 35:46.227
Go ahead, you go,
you have a good dinner, huh.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.355
I mean, there's no reason
we can't be friends, is there?

35:49.939 --> 35:51.482
That's-that's an improvement,
anyway, isn't it?

35:53.943 --> 35:55.236
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that's good. That's good.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.963
Okay, uh, you take care now.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.636
-Thanks, Stan.
-Okay, Vera.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.388
I hope everything works out for you, okay?

36:22.471 --> 36:23.389
Okay.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.684
WOMAN: I'm at home...

36:28.853 --> 36:31.355
-No, Stan, it's not enough!
-(gunshots)

36:32.690 --> 36:33.941
Ah!

36:35.193 --> 36:37.570
(dramatic music playing)

36:39.155 --> 36:39.989
No.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.127
-(door opens)
-...back here on time.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.880
Leo! Leo, you'll never guess
what just happened to us!

36:58.507 --> 36:59.425
Oh, my god.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.284
I'm sorry, Captain. I'm sorry for it all.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.911
You have nothing to apologize for, Stan.

37:26.994 --> 37:29.622
-I brought it up to you.
-And I didn't take it seriously enough.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.540
Who could've seen this coming?

37:42.218 --> 37:46.055
-You feeling all right?
-I feel a little weak, a little dizzy.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.307
Have a seat.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.360
You never know what's in people's minds.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.154
You're asking, "What time is it?"

38:03.030 --> 38:04.573
They're hearing, "Oh, promise me."

38:05.825 --> 38:07.535
Maybe you should lie down awhile, Stan.

38:09.036 --> 38:10.621
Are we that much out in left field?

38:12.373 --> 38:14.000
Are we that much strangers
with each other?

38:16.794 --> 38:19.213
(sobs) I never knew what was in her heart.

38:23.759 --> 38:26.012
-Look at me-- I'm crying like a baby here.
-Just take it easy.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.515
(breathing shakily) Excuse me.

38:31.809 --> 38:32.935
I got to make my statement.

38:33.644 --> 38:34.520
Do it tomorrow.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.064
Never put off till tomorrow.

38:38.524 --> 38:41.736
She hears that, she thinks,
"He's trying to say he loves me."

38:42.570 --> 38:43.404
(scoffs)

38:50.578 --> 38:52.371
(clears throat) Is Leo Schnitz here?

38:52.455 --> 38:54.332
-Who's asking?
-His wife.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.752
-Myrna?
-(chuckles) Leo.

39:02.214 --> 39:03.132
(chuckles)

39:05.051 --> 39:06.969
-Can you watch the desk for a few minutes?
-Yes.

39:18.439 --> 39:19.357
(door closes)

39:20.816 --> 39:21.692
(sighs)

39:22.026 --> 39:24.612
You look so handsome, Leo.

39:25.446 --> 39:26.322
You got my letter.

39:28.991 --> 39:31.494
Did you really mean what you said
about coming home?

39:31.744 --> 39:34.205
No matter what, that you'd still love me?

39:34.663 --> 39:37.333
That part most of all,
from the bottom of my heart.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.711
God, you're a very special man, Leo.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.838
I leave you for someone else,

39:42.922 --> 39:46.008
and then I show up a year later
begging you to take me back.

39:46.092 --> 39:49.512
I begged you to come back,
no questions asked.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.931
Oh, there'll be questions, Leo,

39:52.807 --> 39:54.600
like how come I'm putting on weight.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.062
I never asked before. Why would I ask now?

39:59.271 --> 40:01.107
I was never pregnant before.

40:03.859 --> 40:04.819
Pregnant?

40:06.862 --> 40:08.280
Oh, boy.

40:09.031 --> 40:10.074
(sighs)

40:11.409 --> 40:13.536
Look, I'd understand
if you don't want me back.

40:13.953 --> 40:14.787
But I do.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.291
I'd also understand
if you want me to have an abortion.

40:20.960 --> 40:21.794
I don't.

40:22.628 --> 40:25.089
We're not kids, Leo,
and it isn't your baby.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.591
I can love it like my own,

40:28.884 --> 40:30.886
-like I love you.
-(laughs)

40:31.387 --> 40:34.181
Oh, God, I don't deserve you, Leo,

40:34.557 --> 40:37.143
but if you still want me back
after all this,

40:37.226 --> 40:39.145
I'll never leave you again.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.123
This had better be good.

40:59.665 --> 41:00.541
Captain?

41:01.292 --> 41:04.837
Uh, I was there
on legitimate police business.

41:05.421 --> 41:08.466
Taking your prisoner to a health spa
for a fatal coronary

41:08.549 --> 41:10.551
does not exactly conform to policy, Mick.

41:10.634 --> 41:11.510
(snickers)

41:12.553 --> 41:15.097
As for the rest of you, I expect you
to take the last 48 hours

41:15.181 --> 41:17.099
as personal rather than sick days.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.934
Well, I, for one, did that exactly, Frank.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.228
I didn't misrepresent my absence.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.772
You didn't represent it at all, Howard.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.816
In the last 48 hours,

41:25.900 --> 41:28.027
we've had an attempt
on Ozzie Cleveland's life,

41:28.569 --> 41:29.778
two homicides,

41:30.070 --> 41:33.324
and we've been seriously understaffed
in three tactical situations.

41:33.407 --> 41:36.619
Our PBA contract does give us
personal days, Captain.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.787
And decent concern for the people
you work with says

41:38.871 --> 41:41.123
you don't lie and call in sick
at the last minute

41:41.207 --> 41:42.833
leaving us no way to compensate.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.965
I hope you all did better than you look.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.311
Hi.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.438
What are you doing here?

42:05.814 --> 42:06.774
I came down to get you,

42:06.857 --> 42:08.651
just wanted to make sure
you get home on time.

42:09.318 --> 42:10.444
The turkey's in the oven.

42:11.612 --> 42:14.031
Well, it's gonna be a little while, um...

42:14.573 --> 42:16.200
Joe just got back from Vegas,

42:16.283 --> 42:18.911
and he's gonna come over, too, so.

42:19.119 --> 42:20.037
You mad at me?

42:21.622 --> 42:23.874
No, I'm not. (chuckles) I'm not.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.334
Was it something that I did,

42:25.417 --> 42:27.044
or are you having
second thoughts about it?

42:27.795 --> 42:29.588
No, I'm not having second thoughts.

42:31.006 --> 42:32.341
Something ain't right.

42:34.426 --> 42:35.344
You better sit down.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.555
-What?
-Sit down for a second.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.727
-Your mom was in here.
-What?

42:44.395 --> 42:46.272
Your mom was in here. She got arrested.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.107
Where is she? Where can I see her?

42:48.732 --> 42:51.527
Well, she's not here right now.
They already took her downtown.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.696
Downtown? Why didn't you tell me?

42:54.321 --> 42:56.240
Fabian, I wanted to. I mean, I--

42:57.032 --> 42:58.284
You should've told me!

43:01.120 --> 43:02.413
Hey, Big Fabe.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.290
We having dinner at your crib
tonight or what?

43:04.373 --> 43:05.249
I can't!

43:09.920 --> 43:10.796
JOE: What's with the kid?

43:11.547 --> 43:13.966
BATES: It's a long story, Joe.
Do me a favor and let it go.

43:18.262 --> 43:20.014
-About dinner...
-I know.

43:22.516 --> 43:23.434
I'm sorry.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.144
Forget it, Leo. Don't worry about it.

43:25.519 --> 43:26.437
It's all right.

43:32.359 --> 43:36.572
WOMAN: N737492, Vivian DeWitt.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.907
Possession of drug paraphernalia.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.165
Miss DeWitt, what's your pleasure?

43:46.248 --> 43:48.834
(Branford chanting in Native American)

43:48.917 --> 43:50.753
Can somebody shut that loony up?

43:51.837 --> 43:54.423
Your Honor, my client would like
a detox program.

43:56.967 --> 43:59.553
No takers for the Oberman
turkey-day special?

43:59.845 --> 44:00.679
What's that?

44:01.055 --> 44:02.973
You pay your ten dollar fine, you go home.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.351
If you want the program,
you'll be in jail till Monday.

44:06.060 --> 44:06.977
Mama.

44:10.314 --> 44:11.482
Program, Your Honor.

44:12.316 --> 44:13.484
Want the drug-free.

44:16.570 --> 44:19.365
All right. Remand till Monday
for Meadowvale screening.

44:19.948 --> 44:22.660
-Marked papers "court recommended."
-(gavel bangs)

44:23.952 --> 44:25.621
-JUDGE: Next case.
-Mama.

44:27.039 --> 44:29.375
Don't be bothering yourself, now. Go on.

44:30.167 --> 44:31.752
Maybe I'll see you
when you get out, all right?

44:32.503 --> 44:33.462
That's right.

44:49.770 --> 44:50.854
This was great.

44:52.481 --> 44:53.607
Everything was great.

44:53.941 --> 44:55.317
The sweet potatoes were overdone.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.777
(mumbles mockingly)

44:56.860 --> 44:58.445
Everything was perfect.

45:00.614 --> 45:01.490
(sighs)

45:01.865 --> 45:03.158
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

45:03.784 --> 45:06.078
Don't say "nothing."
Something's the matter.

45:08.372 --> 45:09.456
Come on. What's the matter?

45:11.291 --> 45:13.711
-I'm sorry if I've been poor company.
-No.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.381
I can't think how to do this.

45:18.424 --> 45:20.551
I don't know how to do this
and not hurt you.

45:20.759 --> 45:21.635
Do what?

45:23.387 --> 45:25.139
I want us to stop seeing each other, Mick.

45:38.736 --> 45:42.448
Look, if this is about Las Vegas,
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

45:42.531 --> 45:43.657
No, I am. I really am.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.577
I'm sorry that, uh, I made you
miss the concert.

45:47.035 --> 45:48.871
-That isn't it.
-What is it?

45:51.874 --> 45:53.834
It's never gonna be
different for us, Mick.

45:55.794 --> 45:58.297
We love each other,
but we aren't close to each other.

45:59.840 --> 46:00.883
We don't share,

46:02.050 --> 46:04.219
and I want it. I need it.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.346
I feel close to you.

46:08.307 --> 46:10.476
I've never felt closer to anyone ever.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.269
I know you do.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.105
But what you feel and how you show--

46:17.232 --> 46:20.068
Mick, I never loved anyone
more than I loved you.

46:21.904 --> 46:22.821
Used to.

46:24.615 --> 46:25.491
I'm sorry.

46:29.161 --> 46:31.955
(dramatic music playing)

46:49.848 --> 46:51.809
-Mick...
-No.

47:06.532 --> 47:09.493
Think any less of me
for not making Thanksgiving dinner?

47:11.870 --> 47:13.997
Think less of me
for letting you pay for the meal?

47:17.251 --> 47:18.836
I liked your Groucho this morning.

47:19.378 --> 47:22.840
Hmm. That was whistling
past the graveyard.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.216
I was scared.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.135
-Not now.
-Not now...

47:27.594 --> 47:29.680
Not since the Biffer wore his wire.

47:30.222 --> 47:31.056
Hmm.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.726
I'm grateful for a lot of things, Frank.

47:36.144 --> 47:37.020
So am I.

47:40.858 --> 47:43.318
(imitates Groucho Marx)
Say the secret word and win a prize.

47:48.073 --> 47:49.157
(whispers)

47:49.825 --> 47:52.661
-That's two words.
-(both laugh)

48:03.338 --> 48:06.341
(closing theme playing)
