WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:02.396
- Previously on Being Human...

00:02.430 --> 00:04.489
- I can deal with
this pregnancy.

00:04.530 --> 00:06.134
If you want out,
this is the time.

00:06.170 --> 00:08.730
- Celine, are you gonna
tell me what's wrong?

00:08.770 --> 00:12.479
- I had lung cancer
years ago. It's back.

00:12.510 --> 00:13.932
- Bishop!

00:14.540 --> 00:15.905
(Grunting)

00:23.150 --> 00:24.117
- Prepare for what's coming.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.413
- A door.
- A portal.

00:25.450 --> 00:28.090
It takes you beyond. It pops up
when it's time for you to mosey.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.680
- This is all so sudden.
I'm not mentally prepared.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.392
- You've been waiting for this.
- I wish you could come.

00:33.430 --> 00:35.626
- See you in 60 years.

00:36.930 --> 00:38.227
(Screaming)

00:38.270 --> 00:39.089
(Grunting)

00:39.140 --> 00:41.598
(Screaming)

00:43.910 --> 00:45.799
Stay with me.
Come on, man!

00:47.480 --> 00:49.972
(Wheezing)

00:57.090 --> 00:58.580
- It's OK, Aidan.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.782
It's OK.
Just stay awake.

01:00.820 --> 01:03.255
Stay awake,
I'm right here.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.359
- Oh my God! Aidan?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.959
What the hell happened?

01:10.030 --> 01:13.489
OK, um, get Jason down here
with a large bore 1V.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.666
I need to
start a line.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.259
Tell Martha
to clear an OR.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.199
- No, just blood.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.503
- Sit back.
We've got you.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.406
- Nora, he needs
a transfusion.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.601
- Go! Now!

01:22.650 --> 01:24.470
(Panting)

01:24.510 --> 01:26.478
(Aidan wheezing)

01:26.520 --> 01:29.444
- Listen, I told you there
are things I can't explain.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.949
- This is your secret?

01:33.990 --> 01:37.119
No operating room, no doctor.
Just blood.

01:37.160 --> 01:40.619
Please. Please.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.333
"This shouldn't have worked,
for so many reasons.

01:50.670 --> 01:54.470
"But for a little while, for
this excellent moment in time,

01:54.510 --> 01:56.649
"it did work, didn't it?

01:56.680 --> 01:59.320
"And I felt human, alive.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.485
(Bell ringing)

02:07.220 --> 02:08.812
"But you were right.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.181
"A secret breaks things down.

02:11.230 --> 02:12.652
"It's like bile...

02:13.700 --> 02:15.555
dark, corrosive."

02:15.600 --> 02:17.022
- Hi.

02:20.770 --> 02:23.205
- I don't
have any money.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.230
- Oh...

02:24.270 --> 02:25.863
(Barking)

02:29.010 --> 02:31.843
Don't bother running, pup.
You know we'll catch you.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.144
Full moon's not
for another 2 weeks.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.978
- What is this?

02:36.020 --> 02:37.579
- Look at that.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.486
You really
don't know, do you?

02:40.520 --> 02:41.510
Well...

02:42.230 --> 02:44.153
this...

02:44.190 --> 02:45.885
(Grunting)

02:45.930 --> 02:48.058
...i1s how the world works.

02:48.100 --> 02:51.695
(Gasping) You and the
other dogs down there

02:51.730 --> 02:54.495
and all of us
way up here.

02:54.540 --> 02:55.496
(Panting)

02:55.540 --> 02:56.939
- What are you?

02:56.970 --> 02:58.608
- God's little creatures.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.374
(Gasping)

03:02.410 --> 03:04.606
(Grunting)

03:06.850 --> 03:09.069
(Grunting)

03:09.120 --> 03:10.440
- Marcus.
- Woof woof!

03:10.490 --> 03:11.719
- Marcus!

03:13.320 --> 03:16.017
- Aidan. Can you believe this?

03:16.060 --> 03:17.357
You can't even
get a cup of coffee

03:17.390 --> 03:19.358
without running into
a mutt these days.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.722
- So you beat him up
2 weeks before he turns?

03:22.770 --> 03:23.919
(Laughing)

03:23.970 --> 03:26.359
You might as well
beat up a little girl.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.562
Bishop would be so proud.

03:31.310 --> 03:32.277
(Grunting)

03:32.310 --> 03:33.505
(Kicking)

03:35.410 --> 03:37.572
(Sighing)

03:37.610 --> 03:39.339
(Grunting)

03:40.750 --> 03:44.516
- "It's a long story,
and most of it's unbelievable.

03:44.550 --> 03:47.850
"But it's time
you knew the truth...

03:47.890 --> 03:49.984
"now that I have
nothing left to lose."

03:50.030 --> 03:53.227
** Now, now, now
Come now *

03:53.260 --> 03:56.924
* You don't need to be
so rough around me... *

03:56.970 --> 03:59.996
- The blood's coming.
You'll be OK.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.463
(Wheezing)

04:02.510 --> 04:05.536
* Now, now, now
Come now *

04:05.570 --> 04:07.299
* You don't need
to get so hot... *

04:07.340 --> 04:09.570
- Go.

04:09.610 --> 04:12.375
It's just
waiting now.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.478
Go to your door.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.476
- No way.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.343
No way. I need to know he's OK.
- Sally.

04:19.820 --> 04:21.982
Don't miss it
because of me.

04:22.019 --> 04:23.886
(Wheezing)

04:23.930 --> 04:25.455
If I die...

04:26.460 --> 04:27.894
I'm ready.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.820
* Now, now, now Who's out? *

04:30.870 --> 04:35.068
* We don't need
to leave it out *

04:35.100 --> 04:38.638
* We found it
Anymore... *

04:38.670 --> 04:40.479
- Aidan.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.312
- Go.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.879
Maybe I'll
see you there.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.480
* You drive me down *

04:54.520 --> 04:57.182
* It just shows
your weakness *

04:57.230 --> 05:00.825
* Well, I'm your guy *

05:00.860 --> 05:04.592
* And I know
what your weakness is *

05:04.630 --> 05:06.098
* Get your... *

05:06.130 --> 05:08.132
It's OK.
- No!

05:08.170 --> 05:10.502
* It shows your weakness... *

05:10.540 --> 05:12.201
Oh!

05:14.210 --> 05:15.735
- I'm Aidan.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.141
- You're one of them.

05:18.980 --> 05:21.039
- I guess so.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.309
- Yeah. Well, thanks,

05:22.350 --> 05:24.489
but I'm gonna go before
you kill me, if that's cool.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.410
- Hey, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.554
(Panting)

05:29.590 --> 05:32.958
Come on, let me help get you
cleaned up. I'm a nurse and I can--

05:33.000 --> 05:34.399
- Seriously?

05:36.160 --> 05:38.128
- You don't bat an eye
at me being a vampire,

05:38.170 --> 05:40.195
but the nurse thing
is weird? Come on.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.809
Come on.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.677
- Just so you know...

05:50.150 --> 05:53.313
* We don't need to think
like we're... *

05:53.350 --> 05:54.977
It wouldn't have been...

05:55.750 --> 05:59.084
exactly like beating up a girl.

06:00.390 --> 06:02.381
* It just shows
your weakness... *

06:02.430 --> 06:03.750
(Laughs)

06:05.390 --> 06:09.054
"When I'm gone, I at least
want you to know what I was.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.489
"I want you to know
who you are to me.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.399
"Nothing else matters.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.568
* It's a hard, hard thing *

06:17.610 --> 06:19.066
"Not anymore."

06:19.110 --> 06:21.101
* To come clean **

06:29.490 --> 06:31.481
(Panting)

06:32.660 --> 06:36.016
- No. No.

06:38.230 --> 06:41.530
Where's my door? No!

06:41.560 --> 06:43.562
(Panting)

07:08.060 --> 07:10.654
(Footsteps approaching)

07:17.630 --> 07:20.634
- Josh. It's OK.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.559
We met last night.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.169
- Celine.

07:25.210 --> 07:27.599
Sorry, I'm just
a little...

07:29.610 --> 07:31.704
I don't know
what I am.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.071
(Sighing)

07:34.120 --> 07:35.417
I'm sorry.

07:35.450 --> 07:39.114
- Go home, sleep,
eat something.

07:39.150 --> 07:42.051
- No, I can't leave him.

07:42.090 --> 07:44.479
- You'll be more help
to him rested.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.726
- There are things...

07:47.730 --> 07:49.926
There's a thing...

07:50.930 --> 07:54.992
out there that
wants to kill him.

07:56.570 --> 07:59.403
Something you couldn't
possibly understand.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.142
- Bishop and the vampires.

08:05.950 --> 08:09.147
I've understood for
quite a long time, Josh.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.989
But don't worry.

08:11.020 --> 08:13.182
I know how to handle Bishop.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.423
Go home.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.812
- Have you been
here all night?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.489
I guess I left
around 2:00 or 3:00,

08:50.530 --> 08:52.225
right around the time
it became clear

08:52.260 --> 08:54.991
that you weren't
gonna tell me anything.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.068
- I'm sorry.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.407
(Sniffs)

09:05.440 --> 09:06.839
I appreciate what you did.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.678
I know you went
against protocol.

09:08.710 --> 09:11.771
- Josh, I completely
sent protocol to hell!

09:11.810 --> 09:13.778
God, if anyone
found out...

09:15.180 --> 09:17.786
Whatever, it's done.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.281
But if I'm gonna do this,

09:23.330 --> 09:26.823
if I'm gonna put my job and--
I don't know--

09:26.860 --> 09:28.999
My life...

09:29.030 --> 09:31.624
If I'm gonna take
these kinds of risks...

09:32.700 --> 09:34.691
you gotta tell me
if it's worth it.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.299
- I don't know
what to say.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.306
- Really?

09:44.610 --> 09:46.647
I'm keeping this baby.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.786
I wasn't sure, but I am.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.414
- Nora, that's great!
I think...

09:54.460 --> 09:55.950
That's amazing!

09:55.990 --> 09:59.483
- Yeah, yeah,
it would be...

10:00.530 --> 10:03.192
if I felt like
I had a partner.

10:04.900 --> 10:09.963
But I'm beginning to realize
that maybe I don't...

10:10.010 --> 10:11.466
which is fine.

10:11.510 --> 10:14.775
But if that's the case,
then I need to prepare myself.

10:14.810 --> 10:17.040
- I wanna be
that person for you.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.071
- But you can't.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.839
You wanna be that person...

10:23.690 --> 10:25.146
but you can't.

10:25.190 --> 10:27.386
You wanna tell me
the truth...

10:28.390 --> 10:29.880
but you can't.

10:31.230 --> 10:34.256
And I wanna keep
being patient...

10:36.060 --> 10:38.370
but I can't.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.669
I'm sorry.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.058
(Laughing softly)

11:12.530 --> 11:16.194
Oh! He came so close.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.004
- That's why it's
taking so long to heal.

11:18.040 --> 11:23.774
- If you had your fill of live
blood, you'd be healed by now.

11:23.810 --> 11:26.404
Drink me.
- No.

11:26.450 --> 11:27.770
- Don't be a fool.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.276
Bishop's coming for you.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.243
You can't fight him like this.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.679
- Celine, I would
have to drain you.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.655
- I'd rather die for you
than for cancer.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.219
- I will heal.

11:41.260 --> 11:44.594
I just need
a little time.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.637
(Breathing deeply)

11:48.670 --> 11:50.900
And I need
to get home.

11:52.010 --> 11:55.435
(Horn honking,
birds tweeting)

11:58.480 --> 12:00.312
(Engine stops)

12:00.350 --> 12:01.909
(Car door opening)

12:03.250 --> 12:05.742
(Horn blaring in distance)

12:16.030 --> 12:17.122
(Knocking on window)

12:17.170 --> 12:19.161
- Oh!
- L.T.?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.966
- Sully, hey.

12:26.010 --> 12:27.500
- You OK?

12:27.540 --> 12:29.941
It's been a couple days since
we saw you at the station.

12:29.980 --> 12:34.440
- Yeah, it looks like you
caught me sleeping one off.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.970
- In your car?

12:36.020 --> 12:37.488
What happened to your face?

12:37.520 --> 12:38.749
- Oh...

12:38.790 --> 12:40.258
(Laughs)

12:40.290 --> 12:41.360
Right.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.522
I'm gonna need
a little help with that.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.426
(Screaming)

12:46.460 --> 12:48.997
- Help! Help!

13:00.680 --> 13:03.706
>K

13:09.890 --> 13:11.642
- Is Aidan OK?

13:13.060 --> 13:16.928
I know, I'm here.
It sucks.

13:18.830 --> 13:20.298
- Why aren't you...

13:20.330 --> 13:25.461
- Above, beyond,
sipping lattes on cloud nine?

13:25.500 --> 13:29.835
I missed it.
I came home and...

13:31.010 --> 13:33.377
my door just... wasn't.

13:33.410 --> 13:34.809
- Oh, Sally--

13:34.840 --> 13:37.878
- I just can't
deal with it now

13:37.910 --> 13:41.744
or I'm gonna start shooting people
from a bell tower, so-- - I get it.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.284
- On the other hand...

14:03.670 --> 14:07.834
- You're...
- Practically a person, except not at all.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.850
My door disappears,
and I can do this.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.544
Probably not
a good thing, right?

14:14.580 --> 14:15.615
- No, I don't know.

14:15.650 --> 14:19.018
I mean, it might be
a good thing for your ability

14:19.050 --> 14:22.213
to keep up
on current events and...

14:22.260 --> 14:24.126
the stock market and...

14:25.130 --> 14:27.019
Sudoku.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.720
No, it's probably
not a good thing.

14:30.770 --> 14:33.091
- Aidan would know.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.767
- Aidan would know.

14:37.470 --> 14:40.440
(Siren wailing,
horn honking in distance)

14:43.150 --> 14:46.450
- I feel ridiculous.
- You'll feel better once you're home

14:46.480 --> 14:48.710
and an old dying lady
isn't pushing you around.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.013
(Laughing)

14:54.920 --> 14:56.388
- Just go ahead
and sit and wait.

14:56.420 --> 14:57.888
Mommy's
a little busy.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.921
(Panting)

15:10.210 --> 15:12.907
(Elevator beeping)

15:18.580 --> 15:20.241
- I don't know
what number.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.214
- Celine.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.382
(Breathing deeply)

15:31.660 --> 15:33.651
(Panting)

15:35.760 --> 15:37.489
- How well trained are you?

15:37.530 --> 15:38.497
- Uh...

15:38.530 --> 15:40.567
(Clears throats
and coughs)

15:41.570 --> 15:43.607
- Can you deliver
a simple message?

15:43.640 --> 15:46.337
(Chair scraping
against floor)

15:46.370 --> 15:50.500
- I... can't give a--give
a message to anyone

15:50.550 --> 15:53.076
because I don't--I don't
know where they are.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.519
- Mm-hmm...

15:55.950 --> 15:57.418
You know what's funny?

15:57.450 --> 15:59.544
- No, I really don't.

15:59.590 --> 16:04.949
- All I wanted was for Aidan
to become a better vampire...

16:04.990 --> 16:06.321
to embrace his gift.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.624
And it is a gift,
you understand?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.460
- Sure.
- I selected him to create a future, and he...

16:16.270 --> 16:19.399
Well, he hates me
now, doesn't he?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.772
- Yeah, that never
really came up.

16:21.810 --> 16:26.270
- You're going to give
Aidan a message for me.

16:26.310 --> 16:28.074
He and I are
going to end this

16:28.120 --> 16:31.613
like the very old and dignified
vampires that we are.

16:31.650 --> 16:35.609
You're going to tell him to meet
me at the old garment factory

16:35.660 --> 16:37.128
8:00 tomorrow night.

16:37.160 --> 16:42.189
- Who's to say I even know
where Aidan is or if he's alive?

16:42.230 --> 16:44.995
- You're going to give
him the message...

16:46.800 --> 16:49.929
or I will deliver something
of a very different kind

16:49.970 --> 16:51.563
to your family in Ithaca.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.530
What do you think would
upset your mother more,

16:55.580 --> 16:57.901
your heart or your brain
on a platter?

17:03.650 --> 17:06.347
(Door opening)

17:09.990 --> 17:12.686
- That's new.
- That's what Josh said.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.152
It's bad, right?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.849
- Yeah, I think
it means that...

17:17.630 --> 17:18.790
- What?

17:19.770 --> 17:20.964
No, say it.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.540
- I think it means that you're
more tethered to the earth.

17:25.569 --> 17:30.371
- So I'm stuck here, like the
rest of the one-eyed crazies.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.211
- You're still
not solid yet.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.446
You're just more charged.
(Door closing)

17:38.490 --> 17:41.187
(Laughing)

17:45.190 --> 17:46.385
- I saw Bishop.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.125
He talked to me for a
disturbingly long time.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.126
(Grunting)

17:52.170 --> 17:53.695
- Did he hurt you?

17:53.740 --> 17:56.163
- I think he would
very much like to.

17:57.470 --> 17:59.199
But he...

18:01.080 --> 18:04.277
Hey, so you know,
when was the last time

18:04.310 --> 18:05.903
the three of us
just got together

18:05.950 --> 18:07.611
and played a really
good game of Celebrity?

18:07.650 --> 18:10.244
- Josh, just say it.
- He wants to meet you.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.419
Like men, like vampire men
tomorrow night.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.586
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

18:14.620 --> 18:17.157
Why does he wanna meet you?
- He wants to fight me.

18:17.190 --> 18:20.751
- You mean Kill you.
Aidan, you can barely walk.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.293
- This... Me and him...

18:24.330 --> 18:26.264
it's what was
always gonna happen.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.132
- OK, I love you,

18:28.170 --> 18:30.901
but that's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

18:30.940 --> 18:33.477
This isn't 1782
or whenever.

18:33.510 --> 18:35.274
You have a choice.
We have a choice.

18:35.310 --> 18:39.099
- We aren't choosing anything.
- We are a part of this!

18:39.150 --> 18:40.549
Josh and I are your family.

18:40.580 --> 18:43.709
- Yes, and Bishop won't stop
until he's torn that apart.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.447
It's not like I borrowed
his car without asking.

18:46.490 --> 18:50.586
I thwarted his plan of taking
over the Eastern Seaboard.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.225
(Sighing) It's better
if I just do this.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.094
- Tomorrow's
the full moon.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.429
Josh, I saw what you did
to that wolf,

19:06.470 --> 19:08.472
what your wolf did.

19:08.510 --> 19:11.480
- What?
- And the vampires, they were terrified.

19:11.510 --> 19:13.512
You're more powerful
than any of them.

19:13.550 --> 19:14.847
- Wait, you want me--

19:14.880 --> 19:17.588
- Sally, it's not controlled.
- It's not possible!

19:17.620 --> 19:20.783
It's not possible. He said he
would go after my mom and dad.

19:20.820 --> 19:23.380
He said... We could leave.

19:23.430 --> 19:26.479
You, me,
Sally, Nora, we...

19:26.530 --> 19:28.419
She hates me right now,
but I could talk to her.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.066
- You should talk to her
and you should leave with her.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.899
That would be good.
But you should forget about me.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.169
- Sorry, but no.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.204
- This is my battle, OK?
End of story.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.730
- So, what?
We just let you go?

19:39.770 --> 19:40.840
We never
see you again?

19:40.880 --> 19:44.043
What? You just
go off and die?

19:44.080 --> 19:45.878
- I fight.

19:45.910 --> 19:50.211
This should've happened
lifetimes ago, and...

19:51.450 --> 19:55.910
I am truly sorry that
it had to happen during yours.

20:06.130 --> 20:07.734
- The elevator's down.

20:07.770 --> 20:09.135
- Hey.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.999
Whoever says that
dedication to dusting

20:13.040 --> 20:14.474
won't lead to
a bright future is lying.

20:14.510 --> 20:16.501
I just sailed through H.R.
Flying colours.

20:16.540 --> 20:19.601
And Fight Club face?
Loved it.

20:19.650 --> 20:21.414
- I know you're better
than this, but it's a start.

20:21.450 --> 20:22.815
- Well, I'm not that much
better than this.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.944
Working in a hospital
is still some variation

20:24.990 --> 20:26.640
of what my normal life
was gonna be.

20:26.690 --> 20:29.352
Broom, scalpel,
potato, "pototo."

20:29.390 --> 20:31.085
So thank you.

20:32.090 --> 20:34.730
And a question.
(Clears throat)

20:34.760 --> 20:37.366
Why the hell
are you doing this?

20:37.400 --> 20:41.735
- I've been trying to,
you know, be clean

20:41.770 --> 20:44.831
for years, uh, decades.

20:44.870 --> 20:47.271
- Decades, really?

20:47.310 --> 20:49.438
You know there
are programs.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.608
- There aren't really
any others like me,

20:51.650 --> 20:53.379
so I slip up and
I start all over.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.139
It's isolating.
It's frustrating.

20:56.180 --> 21:00.083
So when I saw you cornered
and alone, I thought:

21:00.120 --> 21:03.886
"Well, it doesn't have to be
that way for either one of us."

21:03.930 --> 21:06.080
- So, these slip-ups...

21:07.090 --> 21:09.422
how often
do they happen?

21:09.460 --> 21:10.723
- OK, if we're
gonna be friends,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.693
you need to stop
thinking I'm gonna kill you.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.061
- OK.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.304
(Birds chirping,
siren wailing in distance)

21:21.240 --> 21:25.108
- I know you're scared and
I know you're in a family way,

21:25.150 --> 21:27.448
but we cannot
not do something.

21:30.220 --> 21:32.643
- I was just thinking
the same thing.

21:32.690 --> 21:33.953
- So what do we do?

21:33.990 --> 21:35.617
- I think
you're right.

21:35.660 --> 21:38.379
- About the wolf?

21:38.430 --> 21:40.398
- That room in the basement...

21:42.130 --> 21:46.260
if we can get Bishop down there
and you can close the door

21:46.300 --> 21:48.632
and lock the two of us inside...

21:51.340 --> 21:52.967
Can you do that now?

21:54.010 --> 21:56.172
- I think I can
do that now.

21:58.180 --> 21:59.841
(Inhaling)

21:59.880 --> 22:01.678
- Ray was right.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.990
Push comes to shove...

22:06.990 --> 22:08.617
I'm a killer.

22:11.860 --> 22:15.091
- I don't know what else
we're supposed to do.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.860
This is insane.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.538
(Inhaling)

22:22.540 --> 22:23.860
And yet it...

22:25.110 --> 22:27.602
it almost seems
too easy, doesn't it?

22:27.640 --> 22:31.076
- You mean the part where
I transform into a werewolf

22:31.110 --> 22:32.646
and I attempt to murder

22:32.680 --> 22:35.274
a 500-year-old
super-angry vampire? No.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.215
It doesn't
seem too easy.

22:39.250 --> 22:42.356
- You're a really
scary werewolf,

22:42.390 --> 22:43.653
- Really?

22:43.690 --> 22:47.422
- Oh my God! Like super,
super badass scary.

22:47.460 --> 22:51.021
- So just... don't
say anything to Aidan.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.890
- You don't say
anything to Aidan.

22:52.930 --> 22:55.092
- But seriously,
like, don't.

22:55.140 --> 22:58.132
Like, don't give
him special looks

22:58.170 --> 23:00.309
and get all emotional
and whatnot.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.569
Don't Sally-it-up.

23:01.610 --> 23:03.499
- What does
that even mean?

23:03.550 --> 23:04.506
(Laughing)

23:04.550 --> 23:05.949
(Sighing)

23:05.980 --> 23:07.141
(Sighing)

23:08.380 --> 23:12.544
- You asked me why I didn't wait
for you all those years ago.

23:12.590 --> 23:13.989
- What happened?

23:18.590 --> 23:20.592
(Inhaling)

23:20.630 --> 23:24.294
- I went out for a walk
to get some air.

23:26.270 --> 23:29.160
I was gonna go
to the train with you.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.904
He had other ideas.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.476
- What did he do to you?

23:45.090 --> 23:46.945
I shouldn't have
given up on you.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.310
I should've known.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.022
Celine, my God,
I am so sorry.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.429
- Don't be.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.819
I'm ready to leave, Aidan.

23:59.930 --> 24:04.208
But I can't die until I
know you'll truly live.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.369
Take your life back...

24:12.750 --> 24:14.616
for both of us.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.831
(Sniffs)

24:49.050 --> 24:50.939
Oh!

24:54.320 --> 24:56.687
(Crow cawing in distance)

24:59.330 --> 25:01.822
(Siren wailing in distance)

25:02.960 --> 25:06.567
- He'll fight you, but
he wants to do it here.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.967
There's a room
in the basement.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.038
No one can hear you
down there. Same time.

25:13.810 --> 25:17.974
Oh, and just for the record,
the fact that you're in this car

25:18.010 --> 25:19.444
with a stay-in-school
bumper sticker

25:19.480 --> 25:22.040
is just so wrong
in SO many ways.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.644
- Good boy.

25:37.430 --> 25:40.559
- You know you didn't have
to do that. You know we don't...

25:40.600 --> 25:44.400
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just humour me, OK?

25:44.440 --> 25:45.566
I'm turning into a wolf,

25:45.610 --> 25:47.578
you're going off
to your big awful battle.

25:47.610 --> 25:48.771
I feel like
it's the night

25:48.810 --> 25:51.450
of a big football game
or something, like state.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.279
- Did you even play football?
- I went to the games.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.345
- Yeah.
- You know what we should do?

25:56.380 --> 26:00.089
We should join one of those
local farm-delivery programs.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.953
It would be good. I'd cook more,
be involved. It would be good.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.355
- They'd send you
a bunch of kale.

26:04.390 --> 26:07.690
- Yes, kale's great.
It's good for digestion.

26:07.730 --> 26:08.856
(Laughing)

26:17.670 --> 26:20.435
(Aidan inhaling and exhaling)

26:21.910 --> 26:23.400
- What time is it?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.877
- It's almost 6:00.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.144
(Inhaling)

26:32.190 --> 26:33.817
- Where are you
turning tonight?

26:33.860 --> 26:35.316
- The woods.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.887
- Then you're gonna go
to Ithaca and see your family

26:38.930 --> 26:40.853
and make sure
that they're OK.

26:42.860 --> 26:45.124
- You guys are
coming back, right...

26:46.530 --> 26:50.637
after you do whatever
it is you have to do?

26:50.670 --> 26:52.707
- Yeah.
- Sure.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.575
- I don't wanna be here
without you guys.

26:59.110 --> 27:03.172
- We'll be back. And we'll join that
farm thing. It's gonna be awesome.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.457
(Sighing)

27:08.490 --> 27:10.925
- We should really--
- Yeah.

27:15.130 --> 27:17.519
(Dishes hitting counter)

27:23.070 --> 27:25.505
- So I guess we should've
started a little slower

27:25.540 --> 27:27.770
with the whole
being-normal thing, huh?

27:27.810 --> 27:29.801
(Laughing softly)

27:33.780 --> 27:35.509
- Do you need
a ride tonight or--

27:35.550 --> 27:36.847
- No, I'm good,
I'm good.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.382
You go.

27:45.860 --> 27:48.522
(Inhaling and exhaling)

27:52.700 --> 27:54.691
(Sniffs)

27:59.140 --> 28:01.006
Good luck tonight.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.840
I'll see you
on the other side.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.748
** Follow me down
to the edge of the town *

28:08.780 --> 28:12.341
* The edge of the town,
where the graves are *

28:14.390 --> 28:18.827
- *Swallowed in weeds
in the throws of those trees *

28:18.860 --> 28:23.229
* The throws of the trees,
where my heart lies *

28:23.260 --> 28:26.423
* You can be my one
if you wanna go *

28:26.470 --> 28:30.862
* You can be my Juliet then *

28:30.910 --> 28:35.131
* And we can drift asleep
in a lover's pose *

28:35.180 --> 28:38.969
* But never go away *

28:39.010 --> 28:42.548
* No poison
Here, we're safe *

28:45.490 --> 28:49.279
* Follow me down
to the kingdom around *

28:49.320 --> 28:54.349
* The edge of now,
where the tracks are... *

28:54.400 --> 28:57.392
"Nora: This shouldn't
have worked

28:57.430 --> 28:59.159
"for so many reasons.

28:59.200 --> 29:03.194
"But for a little while, for
this excellent moment in time,

29:03.240 --> 29:04.935
"it did work, didn't it?

29:06.240 --> 29:09.403
"The truth is I never expected
what I found with you,

29:09.440 --> 29:14.014
"that possibility of a future
I'd given up so long ago.

29:14.050 --> 29:15.643
"But I can't
step into that future

29:15.680 --> 29:17.819
"without helping
my family first,

29:17.850 --> 29:19.818
"not just my parents
and my sister

29:19.850 --> 29:23.457
"whom I've hurt for too long,
but my family here in Boston.

29:23.490 --> 29:26.528
"They're part of my secret,
part of my survival

29:26.560 --> 29:28.551
"and I owe this to them.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.160
"I don't know if I'll even
be here after tonight,

29:31.200 --> 29:33.123
"but if I am..."

29:36.600 --> 29:41.174
* Juliet *

29:45.180 --> 29:50.175
* Juliet *

29:53.090 --> 29:56.879
* You can be my one
if you wanna go *

29:56.920 --> 30:00.481
* You can be
my Juliet then... **

30:00.530 --> 30:02.521
(Panting)

30:02.560 --> 30:05.166
(Grunting)

30:05.200 --> 30:08.090
- Need help?
- Just stick to the plan.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.865
When Bishop walks through
that door, you shut it.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.708
I'll be fine.

30:16.380 --> 30:19.099
Just remind Aidan to...

30:19.150 --> 30:21.448
come let me out
in the morning...

30:23.820 --> 30:26.141
or... to carry me out.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.680
You know.

30:27.720 --> 30:30.212
- You're a good person, Josh.
(Zipper unzipping)

30:30.260 --> 30:31.955
A good friend.

30:33.230 --> 30:37.326
And Ray was wrong.
You're not a killer.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.234
You never were.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.172
Be safe.

30:53.050 --> 30:54.040
- What?

30:55.650 --> 30:57.641
Sally. Sally!

31:00.050 --> 31:01.711
(Screaming)

31:06.260 --> 31:10.128
- Is he OK?
- He may never speak to me again.

31:11.470 --> 31:15.065
And I may never speak to you
again for making me do this.

31:15.100 --> 31:19.003
- And you're sure you told Bishop the right place?
- She did.

31:22.710 --> 31:24.144
Cute thing.

31:24.180 --> 31:25.147
- Leave.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.945
- No, let me help you.
- Sally.

31:27.980 --> 31:31.143
- Oh, don't worry about
hurting my feelings.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.544
I'll see you later.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.529
You took everything
from me, Aidan.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.426
- You did this to yourself.

31:43.530 --> 31:44.895
- Maybe.

31:46.570 --> 31:48.038
(Grunting)

31:50.870 --> 31:52.861
(Grunting)

31:56.110 --> 31:58.647
(Door opening)

31:58.680 --> 31:59.750
- Josh.

32:01.180 --> 32:03.342
What do you mean
"when I'm gone"?

32:03.380 --> 32:06.350
(Grunting)
- Nora, get out.

32:06.390 --> 32:07.414
- Josh?

32:07.450 --> 32:11.455
- Please.
(Screaming)

32:11.490 --> 32:14.460
- Oh my God!
Josh, are you OK?

32:15.330 --> 32:18.027
- No, no, no.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.630
Get out, get out, get out!
- Oh my God!

32:22.070 --> 32:24.061
(Screaming)

32:25.070 --> 32:27.061
(Screaming)

32:28.080 --> 32:31.072
(Screaming)

32:34.320 --> 32:36.243
(Screaming)

32:36.280 --> 32:38.749
(Growling)

32:39.750 --> 32:41.752
(Screaming)

32:44.190 --> 32:46.852
(Growling)

32:46.890 --> 32:50.690
Oh God! Oh!

32:52.600 --> 32:54.295
No.

32:57.270 --> 32:59.307
(Screaming)

32:59.340 --> 33:02.310
Oh! An!

33:02.340 --> 33:04.172
- Hmm?

33:05.180 --> 33:07.171
(Sniffing)

33:13.420 --> 33:14.558
(Grunting)

33:15.820 --> 33:18.323
- I chose you because
you were brave.

33:19.930 --> 33:22.649
But you're afraid of the
greatness I could give you.

33:22.700 --> 33:23.929
You're afraid to fail.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.928
- You're the coward
hiding behind an army,

33:25.970 --> 33:28.268
never strong enough
to stand on your own.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.438
(Grunting)

33:31.170 --> 33:33.309
(Grunting)

33:33.340 --> 33:34.637
(Gasping)

33:34.680 --> 33:35.772
(Grunting)

33:37.480 --> 33:39.778
(Grunting)

33:43.520 --> 33:44.544
(Screaming)

33:44.590 --> 33:45.546
(Grunting)

33:45.590 --> 33:46.785
(Screaming)

33:49.190 --> 33:52.751
And for your weakness,
you ruined my life.

33:52.790 --> 33:55.623
(Shouting, indistinct)

33:57.730 --> 34:00.028
(Grunting)

34:01.840 --> 34:03.092
(Groaning)

34:03.140 --> 34:07.509
- You will hate me no more!

34:08.909 --> 34:11.344
(Groaning)

34:12.810 --> 34:15.609
(Grunting)

34:15.650 --> 34:17.447
(Screaming)

34:19.889 --> 34:21.949
(Groaning)

34:47.580 --> 34:51.072
Now, you know you can't
do a damn thing with that.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.418
Now hand it over,
little girl.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.119
(Gasps)

35:02.060 --> 35:03.789
(Gasping)

35:09.070 --> 35:11.061
- I told you to change.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.740
I begged you to change.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.772
(Gasping)

35:17.310 --> 35:19.404
It didn't have to
be this way.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.310
(Gasping)

35:27.620 --> 35:30.453
- (Gasping):
It did.

35:32.490 --> 35:34.492
(Gasping)

35:43.600 --> 35:45.568
(Gasping)

35:47.140 --> 35:49.279
(Screaming)

35:49.310 --> 35:50.869
(Gasps)

36:00.350 --> 36:02.660
(Breathing deeply)

36:07.090 --> 36:09.092
(Panting)

36:19.640 --> 36:21.472
(Horns honking)

36:21.510 --> 36:24.104
(Cawing)

36:31.080 --> 36:33.481
- If I'd known
this would happen...

36:35.490 --> 36:38.118
I thought
the baby was OK.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.822
I was so relieved
it was OK.

36:41.860 --> 36:43.419
(Sighing)

36:43.460 --> 36:45.064
I'm so sorry.

36:46.800 --> 36:50.395
I should've told you
sooner, prepared you.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.900
- I wouldn't have
believed you.

36:56.610 --> 36:59.250
And there's no way
to prepare for this.

37:03.550 --> 37:05.439
What I saw...

37:06.620 --> 37:08.782
you have to
go through that...

37:09.790 --> 37:11.258
every month?

37:13.730 --> 37:16.529
It looks
incredibly painful.

37:17.730 --> 37:20.222
And there's no cure?

37:21.940 --> 37:24.193
- I'm trying to find out.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.935
But right now...

37:28.480 --> 37:30.005
<i>NO.</i>

37:33.150 --> 37:35.642
- How did it
happen to you?

37:37.620 --> 37:40.885
- I was in the mountains
with my friend.

37:40.920 --> 37:46.586
And we thought it was
some kind of animal.

37:46.630 --> 37:49.452
And I guess it was, but...

37:51.260 --> 37:54.332
it killed my friend, Stu.

37:54.370 --> 37:55.838
- (Whispering):
Oh my God!

37:56.840 --> 37:58.604
- And scratched me.

38:00.610 --> 38:03.136
- And just a scratch
was enough?

38:06.810 --> 38:09.677
- After what you saw,

38:09.720 --> 38:12.439
what I put you though...

38:15.020 --> 38:18.786
I can understand if you
don't wanna be with me.

38:18.830 --> 38:23.427
- This is gonna
sound crazy, but...

38:26.030 --> 38:29.193
I felt like I was
finally seeing you.

38:31.570 --> 38:34.107
And now that I know...

38:35.740 --> 38:37.799
- Maybe we'll be OK.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.808
- Maybe we'll be OK.

38:43.550 --> 38:45.746
(Sighing)

38:45.790 --> 38:48.248
- I should get back
to the house.

38:48.290 --> 38:49.917
- Yeah.
- Check on some things.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.689
Is that OK?
I'll come right back.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.358
I'll come back later.
- OK.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.424
- OK.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.599
(Sighing)

39:06.740 --> 39:09.835
(Door opening and closing)

39:17.720 --> 39:21.145
No, no, no. Get out, get out!
- Oh my God!

39:34.070 --> 39:36.129
- We should get cable.

39:36.170 --> 39:38.559
- Right.
- And paint.

39:39.740 --> 39:44.075
Hell, wallpaper. What's the
landlord gonna say, right?

39:44.110 --> 39:45.544
- Exactly.

39:45.580 --> 39:47.844
(Laughing)

39:53.050 --> 39:55.360
(Clears throat)

39:55.390 --> 39:57.882
- You two really
shouldn't have done that.

40:00.130 --> 40:02.553
- It's not that we didn't
think you could take him.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.591
- 'Cause I could've.
You know that, right?

40:04.630 --> 40:06.689
- I do.

40:06.730 --> 40:08.323
I do.

40:08.370 --> 40:10.065
So how was your night?

40:11.670 --> 40:14.640
- This is a conversation
to be had over kale.

40:15.780 --> 40:16.736
(Laughing)

40:16.780 --> 40:18.270
How was your night?

40:18.310 --> 40:21.871
I mean--I mean, God!

40:21.920 --> 40:23.672
Congratulations,
you're free.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.779
- Yeah, what
are you gonna do?

40:25.820 --> 40:28.016
- I think I wanna
learn krav maga.

40:28.050 --> 40:31.179
- I actually can't believe that
you don't already know that.

40:31.220 --> 40:35.726
- Do you wanna come? You could audit,
pick up some skills, fight ghost crime.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.593
- I like it. I like it.
- Mmm...

40:38.630 --> 40:41.395
- Mmm...
- What are you gonna do?

40:41.430 --> 40:44.161
- Oh, now that
I'm here forever?

40:44.200 --> 40:45.861
- Look, you don't
know that for sure.

40:45.910 --> 40:47.162
- No.

40:48.040 --> 40:51.943
But since I am here...

40:53.380 --> 40:55.269
no more waiting.

40:56.150 --> 40:58.585
I'm gonna do something
with my time.

40:58.620 --> 41:01.009
You know? I mean, maybe
I got closure with Danny,

41:01.050 --> 41:06.682
but I never got closure
with my family, my friends.

41:06.730 --> 41:10.621
- So you're just gonna haunt them, basically?
- Basically, yeah.

41:10.660 --> 41:12.560
- Mmm...
- That's what it sounds like.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.829
- And we're all gonna be

41:13.870 --> 41:16.532
supernatural krav-maga
crime fighters.

41:16.570 --> 41:20.006
(Laughing)

41:20.040 --> 41:21.804
(Door buzzer)

41:21.840 --> 41:23.239
- Did you order
a stripper?

41:23.280 --> 41:26.306
- Actually, since our last party
was so rudely interrupted,

41:26.350 --> 41:28.842
I thought it might be fun
to watch you eat pizza.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.871
(Laughing)

41:31.890 --> 41:35.815
- Oh God!
- This guy.

41:35.860 --> 41:36.952
- Hello.

41:42.360 --> 41:46.092
- Hegeman.
You're looking well.

41:46.130 --> 41:48.019
- I have you
to thank for that.

41:48.070 --> 41:51.734
- You've come a long way to
thank me when there was no need.

41:51.770 --> 41:52.737
- But there is.

41:52.770 --> 41:54.738
You've saved us
a lot of trouble

41:54.780 --> 41:55.838
by slaying Bishop.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.099
- It had to be done.

41:58.140 --> 42:01.576
- And you're
honourable. So...

42:02.520 --> 42:03.840
it's time.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.018
- I'm sorry?

42:05.050 --> 42:07.417
- She wants to meet you.

42:09.290 --> 42:10.655
Aidan...

42:11.320 --> 42:13.482
do not be foolish.

42:13.530 --> 42:15.225
You are the leader now.

42:15.260 --> 42:18.662
Of course
she wants to meet you.

42:26.470 --> 42:27.835
- I just don't
see the point.

42:27.870 --> 42:29.099
- You know what
your problem is?

42:29.140 --> 42:31.199
You don't wanna believe
that this is your life.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.378
- You are
very much correct.

42:32.410 --> 42:33.775
- But it is your life.

42:33.810 --> 42:35.710
So why punish ourselves?
Think about it.

42:35.750 --> 42:37.775
An apartment.
We could have a little yard.

42:37.820 --> 42:38.787
We could barbecue.

42:38.820 --> 42:40.879
- You don't even eat.
- I like the ritual.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.058
- It would never work.

42:42.090 --> 42:43.353
- You're very negative.

42:43.390 --> 42:45.688
- You're very observant.
