(Angela)<i> So Sharon's life was, like,</i>

01:45.920 --> 01:49.760
<i>while my life is, like...</i>
<i>clogged.</i>

01:49.840 --> 01:52.360
Yeah, Cherski and Vinovich...
you didn't know?

01:52.440 --> 01:57.240
I think they met at the game, probably
the big game, possibly the big away game.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.240
Should we be like,
attending those things?

02:01.360 --> 02:03.080
Please. Grip yourself.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.880
What is a metamorphosis?

02:26.720 --> 02:27.880
(professor) Brian?

02:27.960 --> 02:31.920
(Brian) When someone totally
changes into something else...

02:32.520 --> 02:36.840
or just when anything...
changes shape.

02:38.520 --> 02:43.520
(professor) Yes. Now the metamorphosis
was written by Franz Kafka.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.440
What does it mean
to call something Kafkaesque?

02:48.320 --> 02:49.280
Anyone?

02:50.840 --> 02:52.320
Want to take a guess?

02:53.680 --> 02:57.160
Um... when something
seems like a total nightmare,

02:57.240 --> 03:00.680
and you can't believe
it's really happening, only it is.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.480
Can you give me an example
of something Kafkaesque?

03:04.360 --> 03:08.400
(Angela)<i> Sharon Cherski</i>
<i>having a boyfriend... and not me.</i>

03:09.760 --> 03:12.640
It has nothing to do
with what anybody said.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.960
It's just... I always knew why
I was coming in here, okay?

03:16.040 --> 03:17.720
But, if people are going
to take it wrong

03:17.800 --> 03:19.760
and give it this whole meaning,
I don't mean it to have...

03:19.840 --> 03:22.320
Ashley DiMarco asked if
you were getting a sex change.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.960
Exactly!
I don't want to be a girl.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.000
I just want to hang with girls.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.320
There's a difference,
but it's definitely gotten out of hand.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.040
<i>♪ So goodbye, leaking faucets ♪</i>

03:34.120 --> 03:37.840

(paper thuds)

-Oh, my...
-(Angela) Who was it?

03:49.040 --> 03:52.360
-(Angela) Did you see him?
-You're not going to believe this.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.240
"Sophomore girls... the top 40."

03:55.320 --> 03:56.840
-What?
-Okay, first one's obvious.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.080
"Hottest sophomore babe...
(together) Casey Hall."

03:59.160 --> 04:02.080
(Angela)<i> Casey Hall is, like,</i>
<i>the prettiest girl in our class,</i>

04:02.160 --> 04:05.480
<i>maybe even in the whole school,</i>
<i>maybe even in America.</i>

04:05.560 --> 04:08.240
I see her in SOSH.
She's always flipping her hair around.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.520
That's one term for it.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.640
Look at this.
"Best butt... Leslie Godfrey."

04:12.720 --> 04:14.440
No lie. She's in front
of me in home room.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.760
"Best legs."

04:15.840 --> 04:19.520
-"Jennifer Kaminsky?" In what universe?
-It's who you know.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.120
Have you viewed her ankles?
Her ankles are like hams.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.720
-(giggles)
-Wait. "Sharon Cherski?"

04:23.800 --> 04:25.880
Who? Let me see. Oh, Angela's...

04:25.960 --> 04:27.920
-Oh, God.
-Well, they are quite sizable.

04:28.000 --> 04:28.880
(giggles)

04:28.960 --> 04:30.520
I mean, if I had a set like that,

04:30.600 --> 04:32.680
-I'd own a small country.
-Things like this make me sick.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.280
(laughter)

04:34.360 --> 04:36.920
Stop reading it. It's stupid.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.440
It's less than stupid. Who asked them?
What gives them the right to decide...

04:40.520 --> 04:42.920
Oh, my God! Angela! I'm on it!

04:43.000 --> 04:46.400
-What?
-"Most slut potential."

04:47.040 --> 04:51.640
Do you love it? Aah! Whoo!

04:51.720 --> 04:52.800
Don't worry. You're not on it.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.360
I don't care if I'm on it or not.
That's not the point.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.760
I just meant you don't get noticed.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.800
You blend in, unlike, say, me,
who basically never will.

05:04.640 --> 05:09.120
Potential slut... where do people
get that kind of idea about me?

05:09.200 --> 05:12.360
-Research.
-I can't even say what this is.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.960
Doesn't this make you mad?

05:14.040 --> 05:17.760
No.
I have the right to live my own life.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.480
-Anyway, it's a goof.
-Mm-mmm.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.680
Who are they to say that?

05:21.760 --> 05:24.840
I mean, I don't want people
saying that about you.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.080
Or maybe about you...
because we're friends.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.120
Rayanne, that's not it.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.680
(Angela)
<i>Or maybe it was, kind of it.</i>

05:34.280 --> 05:37.720
(band playing)

05:41.560 --> 05:43.560
(indistinct chatter)

05:48.880 --> 05:54.040
Sharon, would you play the 12th bar
of 23/4, please?

06:02.360 --> 06:05.520
Your tone lacks a kind of a center.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.720
Could you smile at the instrument and
turn up the corners of your mouth more?

06:08.800 --> 06:12.360
Yeah. Let's try it again, please, at 23.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.400
Two bars. Two, ready, go.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.920
(bell ringing)

06:24.000 --> 06:25.960
Okay, put them away.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.160
Brian, what's going on?

06:37.960 --> 06:39.680
You mean... about the poll?

06:39.760 --> 06:40.760
What poll?

06:42.600 --> 06:44.240
Brian, what poll?

06:46.120 --> 06:48.280
I don't know.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.840
I... I mean...

06:52.720 --> 06:54.960
I don't condemn it, but I don't...

06:56.120 --> 06:58.080
you know, condone it.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.520
(Angela)<i> Okay, so I have a zit.</i>

07:04.600 --> 07:06.600
<i>I have a zit on my chin.</i>

07:06.680 --> 07:10.000
<i>It's not the end of the world... exactly.</i>

07:10.720 --> 07:12.080
(Patty) <i>Angela!</i>

07:12.680 --> 07:16.080
Camille called me at work today.
Can you guess why?

07:16.680 --> 07:18.440
Oh, I know. I know why.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.160
-Why?
-Oh, Mom...

07:20.240 --> 07:23.440
What, "Oh, Mom?" You know we had
a wonderful time last year.

07:23.520 --> 07:24.720
You and Sharon had a great time.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.520
Wait. What?
What was the wonderful time?

07:26.600 --> 07:28.040
The mother/daughter
fashion show.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.520
-I'm not friends with Sharon anymore.
-Well, that's not the point.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.080
-What fashion show?
-The church one.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.240
Mom sewed the dresses,
and they looked like nightgowns.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.280
-They didn't.
-They kinda did, Patty.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.160
Well, I'll get a nicer pattern this year.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.480
It's going to be better.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.720
It's to benefit
the battered women's shelter,

07:42.800 --> 07:44.640
and they're holding it in a real ballroom.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.480
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.920
Can't believe you don't want to.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.200
I'll do it.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.040
Sweetheart, it's really for girls
who are a little bit older than you are.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.600
I know.
I don't really want to do it.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.120
Mom, the only reason you want to go

07:57.200 --> 07:59.440
is because everyone told you
how great you looked.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.200
Did you ever model professionally?

08:01.280 --> 08:03.200
I
can't believe you have a teenage daughter,

08:03.280 --> 08:05.120
-because you look...
-(together) so young.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.200
(chuckles)

08:06.280 --> 08:09.880
Well, I'm so glad I can serve
to amuse you all in this way.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.160
Are you really going to do this?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.560
Are you actually going to sew
matching outfits again?

08:13.640 --> 08:15.520
Of course.
That's the whole idea.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.840
Besides, the sewing will relax me.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.640
-Normally, it makes you curse.
-It's so sick.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.760
Dad, don't you think
matching outfits is sick?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.080
(dog barking)

08:25.640 --> 08:28.000
Uh, no, it's not sick.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.840
It's unbelievably corny, maybe.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.000
I don't think it's so corny.
What is corny?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.480
You know, I really don't ask
a lot of you, Angela.

08:36.560 --> 08:39.360
I'm asking you to do
this one very worthwhile thing

08:39.440 --> 08:41.160
that we've enjoyed before.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.920
Is that so much to ask?

08:45.320 --> 08:46.480
Okay, I'll do it.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.680
(Patty) Look,
I know what you're going to say.

08:50.760 --> 08:54.000
But if I don't do things
like this with her now...

08:54.080 --> 08:56.560
I mean, if not now, when?

08:56.640 --> 08:58.040
In a few years, she'll be gone,

08:58.120 --> 09:01.040
and never phone,
and tell some psychology major

09:01.120 --> 09:04.760
how I never spent any time with her,
not to mention that this is worthy cause.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.000
We're always telling them

09:06.080 --> 09:08.640
how important it is
to be involved in the community

09:08.720 --> 09:11.400
and give something back.
We never do anything about it.

09:11.480 --> 09:14.160
And is it really so terrible
to involve her in something

09:14.240 --> 09:16.480
where she may
possibly gain a little poise

09:16.560 --> 09:18.360
and end up ultimately
feeling better about herself?

09:18.440 --> 09:21.000
Is this a private conversation,
or can anyone join?

09:21.600 --> 09:24.360
Oh, I just feel very strongly about this.

09:24.440 --> 09:28.120
Plus you will be the prettiest mom there.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.040
-(kisses)
-Like it's a question of who's prettiest.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.000
Besides... look at me.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.240
Patty, it was just a compliment.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.280
-A simple thank you will suffice.
-Sorry.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.960
I mean,
you can't pretend you don't notice.

09:44.600 --> 09:48.160
-Notice what? He hedged.
-That my face is changing.

09:48.240 --> 09:52.600
That I have lines that don't go
away when I stop smiling.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.600
Oh, I didn't... it's not...

09:56.760 --> 09:58.560
-They don't bother me, Patty.
-Aha!

09:58.640 --> 10:00.400
-Aha, what?
-Aha, you admit you noticed.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.720
I admit nothing. Aha, yourself.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.640
(turns TV on)

10:09.720 --> 10:10.760
What?

10:11.520 --> 10:13.160
(water running)

10:14.480 --> 10:15.760
-Ready to go?
-Uh-huh.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.120
(door closes)

10:22.200 --> 10:23.560
(door opens)

10:23.640 --> 10:25.560
(indistinct chatter)

10:35.480 --> 10:36.880
(bag zip opens)

10:46.200 --> 10:47.640
So, um, are you...

10:49.520 --> 10:51.600
Are you doing this fashion thing
or whatever?

10:51.680 --> 10:54.760
This... this fund-raiser?

10:57.640 --> 11:00.400
Because my mom said you were,
and I just...

11:00.480 --> 11:01.760
I wondered.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.920
Oh, so that's how it is now.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.400
I can't even ask you a question?

11:13.800 --> 11:16.200
Well, excuse me
for daring to speak to you.

11:16.280 --> 11:20.160
Well, excuse me, but just because you
suddenly decide I'm worth talking to...

11:20.240 --> 11:22.240
Guess what? I changed my mind.
You're not.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.440
Just go squeeze your zit.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.120
(students laughing outside)

11:28.440 --> 11:31.040
Oh, and congratulations on the poll.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.600
Oh, you didn't know.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.080
You're on it.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.720
They both are.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.200
I can't believe you didn't know.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.760
(door opens)

12:00.880 --> 12:02.840
Mmm...

12:02.920 --> 12:06.360
God, I love other people's beds.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.520
So who's into the pillows,
you or Graham?

12:11.680 --> 12:14.320
Now...this is one...

12:14.400 --> 12:15.760
I'd really like to make,

12:15.840 --> 12:19.000
put I'd probably
look pretty stupid in it.

12:19.080 --> 12:23.080
-Oh, why?
-It'd be good for Angela, but...

12:23.160 --> 12:26.560
maybe there's something
in here I can copy.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.960
This girl is everywhere...

12:29.040 --> 12:31.560
perfect face, perfect body.
I hate her.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.200
Speaking of perfect bodies,

12:34.280 --> 12:37.280
I'm in shock Angela agreed
to do this again.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.160
Why?
Our relationship isn't that terrible.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.080
No, it's not about your relationship.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.080
I just didn't think
she'd be into this kind of thing.

12:45.160 --> 12:48.040
It was all I could do
to get Sharon to agree to it,

12:48.120 --> 12:50.760
especially after that stupid poll.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.320
What, you didn't hear about the poll?

12:54.400 --> 12:55.960
We don't hear much.
We live in the back.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.320
Well, it seems... that this group

13:00.400 --> 13:05.640
of hormonally challenged boys
created this charming little document

13:05.720 --> 13:07.920
-rating the sophomore girls.
-Oh, God.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.280
And Sharon got voted
best global endowments.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.840
-Oh, no.
-Breaks my heart.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.320
She's so self-conscious now.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.000
I can't believe
Angela never mentioned this.

13:19.080 --> 13:22.760
-Well, she's probably not on it.
-Oh, right.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.480
No, she's better off.

13:24.560 --> 13:28.440
Oh, definitely. Yeah,
you're right. She probably wasn't...

13:28.520 --> 13:30.720
God, it took me
right back to high school.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.760
You know, I was so
self-conscious about my weight.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.080
Camille,
you were not that overweight.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.760
Patty, I was fat.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.560
I mean, even senior year,
when I lost all that weight,

13:43.640 --> 13:46.640
-I still felt really fat.
-Oh...

13:46.720 --> 13:48.720
But you know what?
I'm glad now.

13:48.800 --> 13:52.040
I mean, not looking that great
in high school,

13:52.120 --> 13:55.320
I had nowhere to go but up.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.880
I got to tell you now,
after all these years,

13:57.960 --> 14:00.240
I actually like the way I look.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.840
That's all that matters.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.880
(showers running)

14:06.960 --> 14:10.960
See, I like how she looks in her video,
but here she's just hideous.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.800
You know, I mean,
what is it with her eyebrows?

14:12.880 --> 14:14.680
No. Look at her knees.
They're so pointy.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.640
(locker slams)

14:15.720 --> 14:17.000
Aren't you hot
in that sweatshirt?

14:17.080 --> 14:18.080
No.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.840
Hey, are you guys going to go
to that party tonight?

14:22.920 --> 14:25.800
-What party?
-That girl in our math class.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.440
Yeah. It's going to be fun.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.800
(Angela)<i> The worst feeling</i>
<i>is suddenly realizing</i>

14:32.880 --> 14:36.880
<i>that you don't measure up,</i>
<i>and that in the past,</i>

14:36.960 --> 14:40.240
<i>when you thought you did,</i>
<i>you were a fool.</i>

14:50.280 --> 14:54.560
What? I'm not allowed
in here, either? Jeez.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.480
(indistinct chatter)

14:58.120 --> 15:01.120
(tapping on machine)

15:03.680 --> 15:05.840
They've been holding hands
for, like, two weeks.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.000
I'm serious. They never let go.
I mean...

15:10.080 --> 15:12.680
It's like their hands have been
surgically implanted, you know?

15:13.960 --> 15:16.680
I mean... how do they eat?

15:19.480 --> 15:20.720
Not that I condemn it.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.360
-I mean, if they want to hold hands...
-No, exactly.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.960
I mean, it's fine with me.

15:25.040 --> 15:30.000
I'm just... I'm just wondering
when all this happened, you know?

15:30.080 --> 15:31.440
Do I.

15:31.520 --> 15:35.840
I mean,
people pairing off into couples.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.560
It's, like, I wasn't
expecting it or something.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.960
Like, did we cover this?
Was I absent that day?

15:41.040 --> 15:43.080
-You know I was.
-(both chuckles)

15:48.560 --> 15:50.400
Well, I got to go to practice.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.960
What, does my breath smell?

15:55.800 --> 15:58.080
So, what do you guys
talk about at practice?

15:58.680 --> 15:59.520
What?

15:59.600 --> 16:02.800
Just give me an idea of the topics,
of your friends.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.520
What's the hot topic of conversation?

16:06.120 --> 16:07.560
There's no topics.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.360
I mean,
I don't know what you mean.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.200
Like you don't know about the poll?

16:15.120 --> 16:18.000
Because you know who did it,
right? I mean...

16:21.360 --> 16:25.920
I mean, it was you and your jock friends,
wasn't it?

16:28.640 --> 16:31.760
Yeah... I know some
of the guys who did it,

16:31.840 --> 16:35.840
but, I mean... I wasn't there.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.120
Does it really bother you
or something?

16:39.200 --> 16:43.520
Guess how many people have asked me out
since that stupid poll came out?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.160
-What people?
-Guess.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.480
What, people I, like, know?

16:47.560 --> 16:51.680
Eight people have asked me out,
Kyle, okay, since Tuesday.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.000
(sighs)
Well, who, Wally Hennessey?

16:54.600 --> 16:57.600
You must really
think I'm stupid, huh?

16:57.680 --> 16:59.200
Wait. Who's asking you out?

16:59.280 --> 17:01.280
You know, even before the poll,

17:01.360 --> 17:03.280
I had my suspicions
that you were just...

17:04.200 --> 17:08.400
that you didn't really, like...
actually like me.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.560
I mean... I mean, for real.

17:11.640 --> 17:16.360
So, good. Okay,
I know why you asked me out now.

17:16.440 --> 17:20.360
The big mystery is all cleared up now.
So... goodbye.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.280
Wait. Sharon... hold it!

17:24.520 --> 17:28.360
You're saying you're breaking up with me
because of what it said on some poll?

17:29.400 --> 17:31.080
Oh, you're so perceptive.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.040
(whistling)

17:36.760 --> 17:38.360
(indistinct chatter)

17:40.720 --> 17:44.120
You know, maybe
we should browse here for a second.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.640
Yeah, good idea.

17:49.840 --> 17:50.960
Pretty girl.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.800
-You're the mother?
-Yes.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.760
Lovely skin.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.480
-What?
-He said you had lovely skin.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.640
(chuckles) Yeah, right.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.000
Angela,
a thank you will suffice.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.320
We've entered a mother/daughter
fashion show together.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.600
-Oh.
-We? You entered us.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.600
You know, I do makeovers.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.960
I could do one for her for
the fashion show. If you're interested.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.000
Really?
Well, that might be fun, right?

18:22.080 --> 18:23.800
You think I need a makeover?

18:23.880 --> 18:26.200
I didn't say you need it.
I said...

18:26.280 --> 18:28.400
(sighs) Never mind.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.720
Anyway, here,
in case she changes her mind.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.080
Oh, this product is amazing.

18:36.160 --> 18:40.880
All those tiny lines around your eyes,
it actually smoothes them.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.280
Did you want me to ring that up for you?

18:44.720 --> 18:46.000
Yes.

It makes it hard
for me to concentrate.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.040
Oh, Angela, come here. I need your help.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.160
Mom, come on.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.200
What come on?
I have to hold something up to you.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.960
Mom, I have to finish

19:26.040 --> 19:28.840

Turn around.

19:28.920 --> 19:33.080
Oh... I really love this fabric.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.520
Don't you love it?
Couldn't you just eat it?

19:35.600 --> 19:36.840
I'm not hungry.

19:36.920 --> 19:42.080
See, I want to get a kind of a...
Mary Quant look.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.120
Mary who?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.040
Mmm! I love the fabric.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.720
I was thinking we could
try the some...

19:46.800 --> 19:50.320
this kind of a French twist
type of thing.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.040
Mom, please don't touch my hair.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.240
What? Come on. Cooperate.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.040
I mean, we're supposed
to be doing this together.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.320
That's the whole point.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.080
-Did you put that cream on your pimple?
-Mom.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.520
Let me see.

20:03.720 --> 20:04.920
Yuck!

20:05.440 --> 20:07.200
Mom, can we not talk
about my skin, please?

20:07.280 --> 20:08.400
Fine.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.160
You know what
you really should do?

20:11.240 --> 20:13.600
Soak a washcloth
in some steaming hot water,

20:13.680 --> 20:14.840
apply it gently to your chin.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.400
-Make sure you have a swab.
-Mom!

20:16.480 --> 20:19.680
What? I'm trying to help.
What is wrong?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.880
(Angela)<i> Just the word... swab.</i>

20:22.960 --> 20:24.800
Mom, I may not want to do this.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.400
Mom?

20:28.480 --> 20:32.080
You have any idea how much time
and effort I've put into this?

20:32.160 --> 20:34.080
-And it's going to be fun.
-Mom.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.400
And you haven't given it
a chance. What is it, honey?

20:37.480 --> 20:38.680
Nothing.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.800
Never mind.
I mean, okay, I'll do it.

Sharon and that guy.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.960

23:38.000 --> 23:39.320
More than kissing?

23:43.960 --> 23:46.360
making her beg for her shoe.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.440
(smirk) Wow.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.200
-I never heard of that.
-(chuckles)

23:51.440 --> 23:52.880
Just listen to me.

23:52.960 --> 23:57.160
-Give me my shoe back, Kyle.
-I will, if you'll listen. Okay?

24:00.160 --> 24:02.520
Now, first off,
I'm not just interested in you

24:02.600 --> 24:05.040
'cause you...
'cause of how you look.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.000
It's what got my attention,
I admit.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.240
But it's not the whole reason.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.120
Okay, that's it.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.040
Here's your shoe back.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.920
So, what's the whole reason?

24:32.520 --> 24:33.360
What?

24:34.600 --> 24:36.480
Tell me why
you wanted to go out with me.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.400
And be specific.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.440
Because...

24:45.520 --> 24:46.640
this is embarrassing.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.080
Good.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.600
Your smile.

24:55.800 --> 24:56.760
I mean...

24:57.600 --> 24:58.640

25:05.480 --> 25:06.480
You're...

25:08.120 --> 25:09.400
usually in a good mood...

25:10.280 --> 25:11.400
unlike now.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.360
Anything else?

25:16.160 --> 25:17.360
It seemed like...

25:19.160 --> 25:20.400
you liked me.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.400
I did.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.080
You did or do?

25:30.720 --> 25:32.880
Look, it's not
just what you've got.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.320
It's your whole...

25:38.880 --> 25:40.080
it's you.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.560
But I must admit,
I'm happy you have 'em.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.680
Why aren't you?

25:53.800 --> 25:55.440
I'm working on it.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.600
Okay, see, the Egyptians,
they wore eyeliner

26:12.680 --> 26:15.080
to ward off the evil spirits.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.440
They believed that if
they outlined their eyes

26:17.520 --> 26:19.960
that the good spirits
would spot them easier.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.600
I read it in a book,
so I tried it.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.680
The eyeliner, I mean.

26:24.760 --> 26:28.040
-You believe in evil spirits?
-Oh, no. I'm Catholic.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.120
Basically,
I just like how it looks.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.000
Oh. Okay.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.640
That kind of makes sense,
I guess.

26:48.680 --> 26:53.080
<i>Like the zit had become</i>
<i>the truth about me.</i>

27:07.880 --> 27:10.320
My hair is so hard to control.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.160
You're so lucky.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.080
You've got hair you
don't even have to bother with.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.240
Oh, my gosh.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.600
Look at those dark circles
under my eyes.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.960
I am so tired.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.000
I've been out late dancing
with my boyfriend

27:24.080 --> 27:25.880
every night this week.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.600
Lucky you. You look like

27:27.680 --> 27:29.800
you get a good night's sleep
every night.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.320
I have to go places with him

27:31.400 --> 27:34.000
and listen to him tell me how
he's always thinking about me

27:34.080 --> 27:36.800
and how he gets jealous
all the time.

27:36.880 --> 27:37.920
Do you have a boyfriend?

27:38.640 --> 27:42.440
-No.
-Oh, my gosh. You are so lucky.

27:44.760 --> 27:45.960
What are you doing here?

27:46.800 --> 27:48.720
That's a good question.
I don't know.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.200
I don't have to go
to the bathroom... ever.

27:52.280 --> 27:53.720
(suspenseful music playing)

27:53.800 --> 27:56.600
Angela! Come on. Let's go.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.640
Look, stop screwing around
and just pop it, okay?

28:02.720 --> 28:04.440
So you can get on
with your life.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.400
But won't popping it
cause a scar?

28:08.920 --> 28:11.640
Anything causes a scar.
Living causes a scar.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.680
My mother has a humongous scar
from having me.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.400
Does that mean
I should've never been born?

28:16.480 --> 28:18.120
So you're saying pop it?

28:19.480 --> 28:20.680
I gotta go.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.000
Don't put concealer on it.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.200
It just clogs your pores worse.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.560
Just pop it!

28:31.360 --> 28:35.240
-(Rayanne) Come pick us up...
-Nice stitching.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.920
Thank you.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.800
-What?
-I hate basting.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.960
It drives me nuts.

28:42.800 --> 28:43.760
Me, too.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.360
All right. Okay. All right. Bye.

28:46.440 --> 28:47.520
Nice design.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.280
It reminds me of Mary Quant.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.120
-We're history. Say good night.
-Good night.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.000
What?

29:01.720 --> 29:03.560
-You hate it.
-I don't hate it.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.880
So can I take it off now?

29:05.960 --> 29:07.920
Angela, what is it?
What is the matter?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.440
Nothing. It's just,
we look like...

29:10.520 --> 29:12.440
Like what?

29:12.520 --> 29:15.280
(chuckles)
Like some kind of warped version

29:15.360 --> 29:16.880
of the <i>Patty Duke Show.</i>

29:16.960 --> 29:20.560
Get it? Patty... Duke.
(chuckles) Patty...

29:25.400 --> 29:26.840
Okay.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.240
Take the dress off.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.400
Take it off. Now.

29:34.040 --> 29:34.840
Mom...

29:34.920 --> 29:39.200
No... you know, you are clearly
not comfortable with this.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.640
I'm not clear why.
You always enjoyed it in the past.

29:41.720 --> 29:44.320
-I haven't enjoyed it all that much.
-I don't understand why not.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.000
I would think you would
welcome the opportunity

29:47.080 --> 29:49.040
to dress up, to look your best.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.240
-Who am I looking my best for?
-For you.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.360
Of course. This is for you.
I mean, I don't...

29:53.440 --> 29:55.960
Mom, just face the facts, okay?

29:56.040 --> 29:57.240
What facts? What?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.080
That I'm ugly, okay?

30:01.920 --> 30:03.640
Just face it. I have.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.520
How can you say that?
How can you poss...

30:07.600 --> 30:09.800
By looking in the mirror, okay?

30:09.880 --> 30:12.280
By looking at you
at the way you look at me.

30:12.360 --> 30:15.720
-How do I look at you?
-By the way you instruct me

30:15.800 --> 30:18.960
on how to wash my face
so I don't get zits.

30:20.200 --> 30:23.040
Like you have to fix me,
like you're ashamed of me.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.280
No. Angela, sweetheart, no.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.480
'Cause you expect me
to be beautiful.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.480
Because you're beautiful.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.000
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.320
I'm just not.

30:45.720 --> 30:50.240
(dramatic music playing)

31:04.560 --> 31:06.600
(sighs)
I completely messed up.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.200
-I know.
-I made it this issue.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.840
I took all the fun out of it.

31:11.920 --> 31:15.440
I put exactly the wrong
kind of pressure on her,

31:15.520 --> 31:17.280
-and I just...
-You lost perspective.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.840
I completely lost perspective,

31:18.920 --> 31:22.240
and I wish someone
could tell me why.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.440
Well, I guess it's because

31:25.520 --> 31:29.600
you were, um, kind of caught up
with something.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.560
You know?

31:32.640 --> 31:35.880
Something unconscious
and sort of overpowering.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.960
Something that kind
of prevented you from...

31:38.040 --> 31:39.800
acknowledging her insecurities.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.240
Oh, who asked you?

31:41.320 --> 31:42.400
(groans)

31:43.920 --> 31:46.520
No... you're right.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.440
Obviously this fashion
show business

31:48.520 --> 31:50.120
really means something to you.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.280
Hm. It's like you need it.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.920
It's like some kind of approval
that you're...

31:55.680 --> 31:58.520
I don't know...
kind of starved for.

31:58.600 --> 32:02.440
And that maybe I can't give you
because I'm just one person.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.520
Not, you know, the world.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.720
So you're flossing again?

32:10.800 --> 32:12.960
Ah... I'm trying to, yeah.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.440
Well, I blew it.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.920
She feels terrible
about herself.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.640
And my timing couldn't be worse.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.200
I mean, the poor thing's former
best friend is voted miss bosom,

32:21.280 --> 32:22.960
and all she gets is a pimple.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.720
Well, that part's probably
my fault.

32:25.520 --> 32:26.320
What?

32:27.040 --> 32:29.520
I'm kidding.
My fault, you know, genetically.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.040
I probably handed pimples
down to her.

32:31.120 --> 32:34.120
Please, Graham. Everybody gets
pimples in high school.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.680
-You didn't.
-I...did, too.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.960
Oh, right. I remember now.
That one.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.040
Come on.
My face was an Italian entrée.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.920
You had one...

32:44.600 --> 32:47.560
one pimple...
like the single perfect rose.

32:47.640 --> 32:50.760
Well, so now the tables
have turned, haven't they?

32:50.840 --> 32:52.400
I mean, I, like all women,

32:52.480 --> 32:55.480
am becoming less and less attractive
in the eyes of the world

32:55.560 --> 32:57.960
and more and more expendable
as I grow older,

32:58.040 --> 33:00.080
while you, like all men,
are considered

33:00.160 --> 33:02.120
more desirable
and more attractive

33:02.200 --> 33:03.400
the older you get.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.080
Of course, you'll die sooner.

33:06.840 --> 33:07.880
That's right.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.880
Well, we better have sex
right now then.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.760
(laughs)

33:20.480 --> 33:25.720
You really have no clue
how attractive you are, do you?

33:27.680 --> 33:30.240
-I'm not attractive.
-Me neither.

33:30.800 --> 33:31.640
(clears throat)

33:31.720 --> 33:34.480
You think
there's anybody in this world

33:34.560 --> 33:36.760
who really believes
that they're beautiful?

33:38.080 --> 33:39.320
Um...

33:41.320 --> 33:42.440
Ru Paul.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.720
-(laughing)
-What?

33:44.800 --> 33:47.840
(laughing)

33:47.920 --> 33:48.920
What?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.720
I just can't believe you
even know who Ru Paul is!

33:51.800 --> 33:54.000
-I can't believe you do.
-(laughing)

33:54.080 --> 33:56.760
Ru Paul strikes me as...

33:56.840 --> 33:58.240
pretty secure.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.360
What?

34:00.440 --> 34:01.680
What?

34:01.760 --> 34:02.920
Nothing.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.680
You're just...

34:05.760 --> 34:09.440
pretty surprising
for somebody I've known...

34:09.520 --> 34:10.920
forever.

34:12.320 --> 34:15.080
Well...right back at you.

34:19.200 --> 34:22.320
(students laughing)

34:22.400 --> 34:23.480
(locker slamming)

34:24.400 --> 34:25.560
(Enrique) Where's the teacher?

34:25.640 --> 34:27.920
It's Renaldi. Half the time
he doesn't show, so...

34:28.000 --> 34:29.280
Hey, uh...

34:29.360 --> 34:32.560
You know that paragraph
or whatever we have to write

34:32.640 --> 34:33.680
about that bug guy?

34:33.760 --> 34:35.480
<i>-The Metamorphosis?</i>
-Yeah. That.

34:35.560 --> 34:39.480
-It was due already, so...
-I know. I got extended.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.760
They said if I
don't turn something in,

34:42.840 --> 34:44.880
they're going to
stick me back in remedial.

34:47.080 --> 34:51.440
Which I'm just...
you know, not in the mood...

34:53.640 --> 34:54.920
to be treated like dirt?

34:56.880 --> 34:59.040
So, what happens
after he turns bug?

34:59.120 --> 35:00.360
I mean, how's it end?

35:00.440 --> 35:02.160
Well, he dies.

35:02.240 --> 35:03.920
Um, they basically kill him.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.440
-They who?
-Wait. What book is this?

35:06.520 --> 35:09.280
Wait. Who kills him,
exterminators?

35:09.360 --> 35:11.120
No. His family.

35:11.800 --> 35:12.800
Huh.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.480
So he never, like, turns back.

35:15.560 --> 35:18.120
No. And they, uh,
they turn on him.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.720
Well, why?

35:19.800 --> 35:22.640
'Cause he's a giant cockroach,
and they're like, they can't handle it.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.880
They're like, repulsed,
so... they, uh, abuse him.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.000
They... they... they starve him.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.760
But what it seems like
when you're reading it

35:32.840 --> 35:35.720
is that, um, ahem,
he dies from loneliness.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.880
That seems possible.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.760
Wait a minute. So, if they're
starving him or whatever then,

35:43.840 --> 35:45.400
why doesn't he just leave?

35:45.480 --> 35:47.760
What's he gonna do?
Check into a motel? He's a cockroach.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.160
-Hey. Roach motel.
-(laughs)

35:50.240 --> 35:53.600
The point is,
he's the same person inside,

35:53.680 --> 35:55.920
no matter what he looks like.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.560
All the same, if I were him,
I'd be out of there so fast...

36:00.640 --> 36:02.920
Out of where? Come here.
I was looking for you.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.640
So, Krakow,

36:05.720 --> 36:08.760
how come you never
ask me over anymore?

36:08.840 --> 36:09.840
(giggles)

36:11.160 --> 36:12.960
She wants you, man. Go for it.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.400
(stutters) So, getting back
to that metamorphosis story...

36:18.600 --> 36:19.840
It's made up, right?

36:20.400 --> 36:22.320
(bell rings)

36:22.400 --> 36:24.200
-There you go.
-Okay.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.200
(woman coughs)

36:36.520 --> 36:39.520
(toilet flushes)

36:56.080 --> 36:57.120
So, um...

36:58.440 --> 36:59.520
Look, uh...

37:00.800 --> 37:02.840
Are you doing this
fashion show thing?

37:02.920 --> 37:06.040
'Cause my mom keeps holding it up to me
that you are.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.720
I was, but I'm not.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.280
So, are you?

37:13.360 --> 37:17.320
No. But...
but my mom still thinks we are.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.960
She's, like, in denial
or something.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.880
Why do girls have to
tear each other down?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.920
I guess 'cause they're jealous.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.400
I mean, I was...

37:39.840 --> 37:41.000
of you...

37:42.640 --> 37:44.200
for having what you have.

37:46.680 --> 37:48.360
Do you know how
many times this week

37:48.440 --> 37:50.120
I wished I had what you have?

37:50.200 --> 37:51.840
I don't have anything.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.800
Exactly.

37:59.520 --> 38:01.840
Well, this really makes sense.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.920
I guess it all boils down

38:05.000 --> 38:06.960
to what they drilled into us
in girl scouts.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.320
-What, sell more cookies?
-No!

38:10.400 --> 38:14.800
No. You know, um,
what you are is...no. Wait.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.120
-Wait. What your gift is...
-Oh! No.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.280
Um...what you have

38:20.360 --> 38:23.760
-is God's gift to you...
-Right! To you. And what you...

38:23.840 --> 38:25.120
Do with what you have

38:25.200 --> 38:27.880
-is your gift to God.
-Gift to God. Right. Exactly.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.480
I can't believe
you actually remember that.

38:30.560 --> 38:31.920
I mean, crazy.
Are you kidding me?

38:32.000 --> 38:35.640
We have girl scout cookies
from three years ago in our garage.

38:42.840 --> 38:46.360
-(Angela) Hi. Where've you been?
-So, was she...

38:46.440 --> 38:48.160
(whispering)
bragging about Kyle?

38:49.480 --> 38:50.480
No.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.480
If you want to be friends
with her, that's fine.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.840
-I don't.
-Okay.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.920
Maybe you do.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.040
After all, she's not a slut...

yet.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.520
You know what?

39:11.840 --> 39:16.040
How many guys you do or do not sleep
with is, like, so none of my business.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.640
It has nothing to do
with our friendship. Okay?

39:22.760 --> 39:23.680
Okay.

Danielle, cut it out.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.440
You have recited the same
mindless, sexist cheer

39:48.520 --> 39:49.800
like, 50 times.

39:49.880 --> 39:52.800
It's not sexist. The girls win.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.160
Just 'cause mom's mad at you

39:54.240 --> 39:56.200
'cause you don't want
to do the fashion show.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.240
I know she really wanted you to.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.080
Yeah. It's her dream

40:00.160 --> 40:03.720
that I magically turn into this
perfect pretty daughter

40:03.800 --> 40:06.360
that she can show off
and take all the credit for.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.120
Too bad I don't measure up.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.440
Well, you do... more than I do.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.040
What?

40:13.120 --> 40:14.560
It's true. Face it.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.360
Who did she pick to do it with?

40:16.440 --> 40:19.640
I mean, not that I really
wanted to do it...

40:19.720 --> 40:21.000
that much.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.120
I'll get Danielle
headed towards bed.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.520
(door closes)

40:49.440 --> 40:51.120
I'm sorry.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.000
Why?

40:54.080 --> 40:56.520
'Cause I wasted your time.

40:57.080 --> 41:00.480
No. You...didn't. I...

41:03.880 --> 41:05.440
I think that I...

41:06.960 --> 41:10.520
needed you up there with me

41:10.600 --> 41:12.160
too much.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.160
More than I want to need it.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.080
Look at you.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.800
Look at how you looked.

41:28.800 --> 41:29.720
Yeah, well...

41:31.120 --> 41:32.280
that was then...

41:33.840 --> 41:34.960
this is now.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.280
Look at you.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.400
So, did you love being pretty?

41:40.280 --> 41:41.520
I don't know.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.320
I don't think I ever...

41:46.440 --> 41:48.800
really let myself know I was.

41:48.880 --> 41:53.080
I was always really careful
not to seem stuck up or vain

41:53.160 --> 41:54.880
or confident.

41:54.960 --> 41:58.520
I look at a picture like that,

41:58.600 --> 41:59.640
and I see...

42:01.160 --> 42:02.600
my God, I was pretty.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.640
I was so pretty.

42:05.520 --> 42:08.120
I just wish that
I had been able to enjoy it.

42:11.720 --> 42:16.400
That's...
all I want for you is...

42:17.800 --> 42:19.040
to enjoy...

42:19.880 --> 42:21.800
what you really are.

42:32.800 --> 42:37.000
Mom, do you have
any cotton swabs?

42:37.080 --> 42:38.520
Millions.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.920
So, what are we going to do
about the fashion show?

42:49.000 --> 42:52.280
Well, I called Camille,

42:52.360 --> 42:54.640
and she's going to try to find

42:54.720 --> 42:58.320
another mother/daughter team
to model our dresses.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.560
-Mom.
-Hm?

43:02.680 --> 43:04.000
I think I know one.
