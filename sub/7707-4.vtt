00:57.058 --> 01:00.192
Thank you. Thank you.

01:00.194 --> 01:03.562
For those of you
who don't know me, I'm ALF.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.531
The answer
to the burning question

01:05.533 --> 01:08.033
who's the only NBC star

01:08.035 --> 01:10.936
with more hair
than Michael Landon.

01:13.007 --> 01:15.207
Well, it's great
to be here in Burbank.

01:15.209 --> 01:19.578
It's just like being back
on my home planet Melmac..

01:19.580 --> 01:21.713
...after it blew up.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.318
Yo, Ed.
Nice to see ya.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.221
Oh, welcome to
"The Tonight Show", ALF.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.856
Ed was missing last week.

01:30.858 --> 01:34.493
So the cops put his picture
on a six-pack of Budweiser.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.062
Ha! Ha! Ah!

01:37.064 --> 01:41.133
Oh! Also with us tonight
is Mr. Tommy Newsom.

01:41.936 --> 01:42.935
Hi, ALF.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.837
After the show tonight,
Tommy and I

01:44.839 --> 01:48.073
are gonna go out
and paint the town beige.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.143
I got a brush right here.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.914
Good one, Tom!
You hang on to that.

01:55.916 --> 01:59.985
Tommy's not dull. He was just
weaned on Novocain.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.921
Well, I'm glad
all of you can get in

02:02.923 --> 02:05.657
'cause it sure was hot
out there today.

02:05.659 --> 02:09.128

How hot was it?

02:09.130 --> 02:12.030
What am I, a thermometer?

02:12.032 --> 02:14.066
Hey, we have a fabulous show
for you tonight.

02:14.068 --> 02:18.704
We've got Joan Embery,
Joyce Brothers and a Pope.

02:18.706 --> 02:22.441

we'll be right back.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.365
You interrupted my drum solo.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.868
Oh, we're back!
Huh! Hi.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.303
Uh, I guess it must be time

03:58.305 --> 04:03.875
for our spontaneous, unrehearsed
banter. You start.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.511
Well, gee. I-I-I don't know
where to start.

04:06.513 --> 04:09.281
Alright, alright, I'll start.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.883
Great to be here, Ed,
you know, I haven't seen you

04:11.885 --> 04:13.852
since I opened my mail
this morning.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.988
- Ah! Ha! Ha!
- Oh-ho..

04:15.990 --> 04:18.123
You got one of my sweepstakes
announcements, did you?

04:18.125 --> 04:21.526
Yeah. How many jobs
do you have, anyway?

04:21.528 --> 04:23.328
Well, well a lot.

04:23.330 --> 04:26.031
Oh. Well, you know,
I really enjoy you on that show

04:26.033 --> 04:28.834
where they have all those
mistakes and foul-ups.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.837
Oh, you mean "Bloopers
& Practical Jokes."

04:31.839 --> 04:36.041
No. "Star Search."
Ah! Ah! Ah!

04:36.043 --> 04:38.910
Well, your show
is certainly a hit, ALF.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.446
What show is that, Ed?

04:41.448 --> 04:45.717
Well, "ALF," right here on NBC,
8 o'clock on Monday nights.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.987
Oh, that show. Thanks.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.722
I understand
you brought some clips.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.291
Would you like
to set them up?

04:52.293 --> 04:54.026
I'd love to.

04:54.028 --> 04:57.562
See, in my show,
I play an alien life form.

04:57.564 --> 04:59.898
It's a real stretch for me.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.833
Watch the monitors.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.213
ALF.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.817
Why did you do that?

05:18.819 --> 05:21.853
Well, I could have
licked your hand.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.690
But I didn't think
either of us would enjoy that.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.493
What a strange family.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.028
[ALF coughs]

05:32.499 --> 05:35.100
Now what do you want?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.435
Nothing.

05:36.437 --> 05:40.439
I was just doing
the Heimlich maneuver on myself.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.307
[coughing]

05:43.610 --> 05:44.943
By the way

05:44.945 --> 05:48.313
don't bother looking
for your laxative on a rope.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.217
Oh, you mean
my soap on a rope.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.087
Trust me on this one.

06:00.361 --> 06:03.462
Great. That's "ALF,"
Monday nights at 8 o'clock.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.431
- Good clips, huh?
- Well, they look pretty funny.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.033
Pretty funny?

06:08.035 --> 06:12.037
If I were Johnny, you'd be doing
that "Ho! Ho! Ho!" thing.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.607
Well, I'm sorry, ALF.
Ho! Ho! Ho!

06:15.609 --> 06:18.143
Don't patronize me.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.146
Well, now I guess we know
all about your rise to stardom.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.715
Every possible thing we could
want to know about ALF

06:23.717 --> 06:25.117
you have now told us.

06:25.119 --> 06:28.754
You are wrong, compensated
spokesman-breath.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.989
You mean...there's more?

06:30.991 --> 06:34.025
Yes. In my quest for stardom

06:34.027 --> 06:37.529
I was screen-tested for roles
too numerous to mention.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.499
Okay, I'll mention them.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.234
For example

06:42.236 --> 06:45.103
I did not get the role
of Obi-Wan Kenobi

06:45.105 --> 06:47.105
in the movie "Star Wars."

06:48.275 --> 06:53.011
I did not get the lead
in the "FDR Story."

06:53.013 --> 06:56.381
'But I did get called back
twice for the role of Eleanor.'

06:57.785 --> 07:01.453
And I lost out
to McGruff the Crime Dog

07:01.455 --> 07:06.358
'for the lead
in "Sam Spade Gets Spayed."'

07:06.360 --> 07:08.727
Those screen tests
look suspiciously like

07:08.729 --> 07:11.263
episodes of your show, ALF.

07:11.265 --> 07:14.966
My cup looks
suspiciously empty, Ed.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.102
Okay, I'll, I'll get
you a refill.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.539
Thank you, and while you're
gone, I'll show some clips

07:20.541 --> 07:24.342
of just how versatile
a performer I am.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.977
You folks,
watch the monitors.

07:25.979 --> 07:29.514
- What about the Pope?
- He can watch, too.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.049
Roll the tape.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.622
¶ Stop in the name of love ¶

07:37.624 --> 07:41.126
¶ Before you break my heart ¶

07:41.128 --> 07:45.764
¶ Stop in the name of love ¶

07:45.766 --> 07:48.900
¶ Before you break my heart ¶

07:48.902 --> 07:52.437
¶ Think it over ¶¶

07:53.907 --> 07:58.076
Oh, hi. Oh, a housewarming gift,
how nice.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.880
Call number 464.

08:03.050 --> 08:06.585
Fourteen minutes
to Bristol, Connecticut.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.286
'Call number..'

08:23.637 --> 08:25.303
Hit the music, will you?

08:25.305 --> 08:27.572
I'm gonna watch
"Dance Fever."

08:29.810 --> 08:32.711
[pop music on music player]

08:32.713 --> 08:35.580
Yeah, go feverettes!

08:38.085 --> 08:40.652
ALF, I thought we agreed

08:40.654 --> 08:44.756
that you'd stop
impersonating me on the phone.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.191
We agreed I would stop

08:46.193 --> 08:48.960
impersonating the cast
of "Green Acres."

08:48.962 --> 08:53.331
[imitates Mr. Haney]
Although,
Mr. Haney could have sold Brian

08:53.333 --> 08:58.403
some revivifying potion
out of the back of his truck.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.308
I'm sorry it took so long..

09:03.310 --> 09:05.677
ALF? ALF?

09:05.679 --> 09:07.045
AL..

09:07.047 --> 09:11.516
I'm not ALF.
I am Melmac the magnificent.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.186
Oh, no.
That's Johnny's turban.

09:15.188 --> 09:18.323
Nobody wears Johnny's turban.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.326
Look again,
banana number two.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.296
I hold in my hands
these envelopes.

09:24.298 --> 09:27.132
And without ever having
seen the questions

09:27.134 --> 09:31.536
I, in my mystical
and borderline tasteful way

09:31.538 --> 09:33.438
will divine the answers.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.807
Where are the answers?

09:35.809 --> 09:38.643
They're in the desk, but
Johnny's supposed to do those

09:38.645 --> 09:40.512
tomorrow night.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.514
So, who's stopping him?

09:45.552 --> 09:46.952
[sighs]

09:46.954 --> 09:51.656
- "Red square."
- ALF, look, uh..

09:51.658 --> 09:53.658
Red square.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.734
"What do you call that blotch
on Gorbachev's head?"

10:04.204 --> 10:06.705
- Red square.
- Red square.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.576
- "Junk bonds."
- Junk bonds.

10:15.616 --> 10:19.718
"What do you call
the last three 007 movies?"

10:19.720 --> 10:21.586
Junk bonds.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.458
- "Palomino."
- Palomino.

10:26.460 --> 10:30.128
- Palomino.
- Palomino.

10:35.736 --> 10:39.004
"What did Trigger
sue Roy Rogers for?"

10:41.008 --> 10:44.309
I should go back to my old job
pulling porch splinters

10:44.311 --> 10:47.379
out of Bartles & Jaymes.

10:50.450 --> 10:54.452
- "St. Elsewhere."
- St. Elsewhere.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.893
"What's the message
on Mother Teresa's

11:01.895 --> 11:03.361

St. Elsewhere.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.002
"Rich, little."

11:11.004 --> 11:13.171
Rich, little.

Ha! Ha!
Wrote that one myself!

11:50.210 --> 11:54.345
I hold in my hand
the last envelope.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.250
May an alien
from a distant planet

11:59.252 --> 12:01.352
invade your living room
every Monday night

12:01.354 --> 12:03.855
at 8:00, 7:00 Central.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.014
here, I had to take
a few tucks in this turban.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.584
You might wanna have it
fixed before Johnny gets back.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.752
Oh, boy.

12:33.754 --> 12:37.355
There's more to come,
so stay tuned.

- I don't know.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.074
Oh, I don't know, ALF.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.475
You don't really explain
how you do it

12:57.477 --> 12:59.711
you just do it,
it's like breathing.

12:59.713 --> 13:01.579
Oh, come on! Teach me.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.048
Well, it only works
if it's spontaneous.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.750
Just do a little one.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.453
Hi-oh.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.689
Well, let me get this right

13:11.691 --> 13:14.826
is the accent
on the "Hi" or the "Oh?"

13:14.828 --> 13:17.695
- ALF.
- Hi-oh!

13:17.697 --> 13:20.331
You really should
bring out our first guest.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.435
Boy, Ed. You're a real slave
to tradition.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.738
We are honored that
our first guest

13:26.740 --> 13:28.373
has chosen this show

13:28.375 --> 13:31.709
on which to make a rare
television appearance.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.679
The spiritual leader
of millions worldwide.

13:34.681 --> 13:38.049
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

13:38.051 --> 13:40.718
Dr. Joyce Brothers.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.856
ALF! You should bring
out the Pope first.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.858
Who's hosting here, Ed?

13:48.361 --> 13:50.361
I'm waiting.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.363
You are, ALF.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.266
Dr. Joyce, haul it out here!

14:02.576 --> 14:05.343
Hello, ALF,
it's very nice to meet you.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.213
What happened to your accent?

14:08.215 --> 14:09.647
What accent?

14:11.218 --> 14:12.951
Who are you?

14:12.953 --> 14:15.520
I'm Dr. Joyce Brothers.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.356
Oh, no!

14:18.358 --> 14:22.126
I got you mixed up
with Dr. Ruth.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.596
Huh! I'm sure
it happens all the time.

14:24.598 --> 14:27.532
- It's never happened before.
- Oh.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.267
What kind of doctor are you?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.169
I'm a psychologist,
I'm an expert

14:31.171 --> 14:33.738
in interpersonal
human relationships.

14:33.740 --> 14:37.275
Oh. Well, did you bring any
clips to show us?

14:37.277 --> 14:39.911
I'm a psychologist.
I don't have any clips.

14:39.913 --> 14:43.081
Well, you're in luck.
I brought a few extra.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.782
Watch the monitor.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.621
Well, the week is over,
as far as I'm concerned.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.689
I'm gonna have
a plain old orange.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.938
Willie, I don't think that
I can make it till sundown.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.841
Why don't we go away
for the day?

15:09.843 --> 15:12.543
- Good idea.
- Oh, come on, that's silly.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.812
Now, why don't we just
tell ALF that he's won?

15:14.814 --> 15:17.482
Well, I'm for that.
You've won.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.984
- Won, ma'am?
- The bet is off.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.720
You can turn in your-your whisk
broom and your phony accent

15:22.722 --> 15:25.957
and let out a big burp
and let's get on with it.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.432
ALF. ALF.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.267
What? What? What?

15:36.269 --> 15:37.735
What are you doing?

15:37.737 --> 15:40.638
Well, I was sleeping
till you woke me up.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.375
Well, since when do you
sleep standing up?

15:44.377 --> 15:48.479
Since I started sleeping
with that box on my head.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.882
You look ridiculous.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.584
Well, not everyone
sleeps like you

15:53.586 --> 15:56.688
mouth open,
drooling on the pillow.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.423
[imitates Willie snoring]

16:00.160 --> 16:02.126
Go on, go back to the couch.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.262
It's too dangerous out there.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.264
I had to kill
a 50-foot water snake

16:06.266 --> 16:08.766
with my pocket knife.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.803
There, there are no
50-foot water snakes

16:11.805 --> 16:12.870
in the backyard.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.440
I'm telling you,
it was bright green

16:15.442 --> 16:17.075
and it spit water.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.609
[imitates spitting]

16:19.612 --> 16:22.914
That was my new garden hose.

16:22.916 --> 16:26.651
Oh. No wonder it was
sucking on the spigot.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.323
Hey, Lynn!

16:32.325 --> 16:34.092
You want to take over
for Willie?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.560
Okay.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.132
Your move.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.567
Okay.

16:45.038 --> 16:48.039
[snickering]

16:49.776 --> 16:50.942
Checkmate.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.686
So, doc,
what did you think?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.621
Well, judging
from those clips

17:03.623 --> 17:05.256
I think you have
a little trouble

17:05.258 --> 17:07.658
meshing with the family unit.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.461
Oh, yeah?
So is your grandmother.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.498
That's a rather
defensive attitude, ALF.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.634
Are you afraid to face
a realistic assessment of your..

17:16.636 --> 17:19.504
¶ I can't hear you
I'm not even listening ¶

17:19.506 --> 17:22.640
¶ I'm the guest host
you are just a guest ¶¶

17:22.642 --> 17:24.242
Maybe I'd better come back
at another time.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.110
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

17:26.112 --> 17:28.046
Do you feel threatened
when prevented

17:28.048 --> 17:32.216
from espousing tenets
of your so-called profession?

17:32.218 --> 17:35.686
Possibly revealing a lack
of maturity on your part.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.056
So is your grandmother.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.027
Way to go, ALF.

17:43.029 --> 17:46.664
Joyce Brothers' been coming
on this show for 25 years

17:46.666 --> 17:49.467
and that's the first time
she walked off.

17:49.469 --> 17:50.735
Well, what did I do?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.271
She's the one who forgot
to bring clips.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.106
Uh-oh. Here comes
the producer.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.543
(ALF)
Oh. Hi, Freddy.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.977
It's Fred De Cordova

17:59.979 --> 18:04.082
executive producer
of "The Tonight Show."

18:04.084 --> 18:05.550
ALF, uh..

18:06.519 --> 18:09.554
Pope John Paul.

18:10.690 --> 18:14.926
Fred, John Paul Jones.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.160
Your turn.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.328
Alright.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.729
There is a logical sequence

18:18.731 --> 18:21.732
by which we bring out
guests on this show, uh..

18:21.734 --> 18:24.235
World religious leaders

18:24.237 --> 18:27.939
doctors, uh, people from zoos.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.442
So what?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.711
Well, if you'll read
your contract

18:33.713 --> 18:38.182
if you don't do it our way,
you don't get paid.

18:38.184 --> 18:40.184
[choking]

18:41.287 --> 18:42.787
Ladies and gentlemen

18:42.789 --> 18:46.257
His Holiness
Pope John Paul II.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.260
[instrumental music]

18:53.399 --> 18:55.099
So, what's the deal?

18:56.569 --> 18:58.136
His Holiness is
in the restroom.

18:58.138 --> 19:01.038
He drank a lot of coffee
waiting to come on.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.742
So, now what are we gonna do?

19:04.744 --> 19:08.112
Oh, I know, let's play
Stump the Band.

19:08.114 --> 19:11.282
You hold down the band,
I'll saw of their legs.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.683
Oh, my.

19:13.953 --> 19:17.622
You could bring out
another one of your guests.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.223
Alright, alright.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.826
Send out whoever
you got back there.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.029
[instrumental music]

19:28.468 --> 19:30.735
Hi, Joan.
Welcome to the show.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.804
Ladies and gentlemen

19:33.806 --> 19:36.274
Joan Embery
of the San Diego Zoo.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.742
[audience applauding]

19:37.744 --> 19:42.079
Joan, Joan, you didn't have
to bring me a snack.

19:42.081 --> 19:46.250
This is Felis Catus,
a domestic house cat.

19:46.252 --> 19:47.685
My favorite!

19:47.687 --> 19:50.922
Hey, that, now, that looks
like the cat from your show.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.392
Why, so it is.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.860
You know, I had planned
on bringing

19:55.862 --> 19:57.495
a reticulated python

19:57.497 --> 20:01.866
but somebody let him go
and put this cat in his cage.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.901
It was probably the Pope.

20:03.903 --> 20:07.738
He's been hanging around
backstage all night.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.641
The Pope told me you did it.

20:10.643 --> 20:14.011
Hey, who are you gonna believe,
me or the Pope?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.582
Did you bring any clips?

20:17.584 --> 20:21.185
Clips?
No, I brought a snake.

20:21.187 --> 20:24.055
Well, I have a few clips
I think you might enjoy.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.323
Roll 'em.

20:27.527 --> 20:31.195
6:13. One minute to go,
Luckmeister.

20:31.197 --> 20:35.333
Then I'll be down on you
like a buzzard on a gut wagon.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.701
[bell dings]

20:36.703 --> 20:39.036
The Duck a l'Orange is ready.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.607
Have some wine,
it'll slow down your reflexes.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.212
Alright. Hold still, Lucky.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.615
I'll be off your back
in a minute.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.017
Hey!

20:56.222 --> 20:57.955
[grunts]

20:57.957 --> 21:01.959
The only good cat
is a stir-fried cat.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.661
Did you ever hear
the expression

21:03.663 --> 21:06.030
curiosity killed the cat?

21:06.032 --> 21:09.367
Yeah, it's usually followed
by the expression

21:09.369 --> 21:11.802
"Pass the plum sauce."

21:13.539 --> 21:15.406
Hello, young man?

21:15.408 --> 21:16.974
Hello, old woman.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.945
Uh, we are terribly sorry
to bother you so late

21:20.947 --> 21:23.481
but we-we couldn't
get out any earlier.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.784
Oh, well, I'm afraid that
I gave my last candy bar away

21:26.786 --> 21:29.387
over an hour ago.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.489
Oh, shucks.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.392
Now, I'll see if I can find
something else.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.726
[cat purrs]

21:35.728 --> 21:37.528
Was that a cat?

21:37.530 --> 21:40.398
Oh, yes, I have lots of cats.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.069
Well, I'll take a yellow one.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.042
What is cat...juice?

21:51.044 --> 21:52.843
Well, it's just like
orange juice.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.845
But instead of squeezing
the juice out of an orange

21:54.847 --> 21:56.447
you squeeze the juice
out of a--

21:56.449 --> 21:59.116
- I-I don't want to hear it.
- Then cover your ears.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.652
- Cat.
- I heard it.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.820
You were warned.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.155
[hiccups]

22:07.660 --> 22:09.760
Too rough?

22:09.762 --> 22:12.596
- You're awful.
- Hey, Joan, relax.

22:12.598 --> 22:16.200
I haven't eaten a single cat
since I've been here.

22:16.202 --> 22:19.970
They've all been married!
Ha! Ha! Ha!

22:19.972 --> 22:21.305
Ah! Ah!

22:21.307 --> 22:24.108
I'm reporting you
to the ASPCA.

22:26.179 --> 22:29.714
Oh, just what I need,
union problems.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.515
Next time you have
a cat on the show

22:31.517 --> 22:34.251
make sure you bring
enough for everybody.

22:35.388 --> 22:38.255
Nice going, ALF.
You're two for two.

22:38.257 --> 22:41.292
Why don't you get the Pope
out here and try for a shut-out?

22:41.294 --> 22:44.462
Ha! Good one,
driver's Ed! Ha ha!

[cup shattering]

22:45.932 --> 22:46.997
Ooh.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.835
You broke Johnny's cup.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.170
Hey, that's nothing.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.940
You should see what I did
to his dressing room.

22:55.942 --> 22:59.543
I've never seen
Johnny's dressing room.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.079
I-I mean, I-I'm not allowed.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.818
Oh, great. It's Fred
with a phone.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.454
Don't you have an office, man?

23:10.456 --> 23:12.490
There's a phone call for you.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.458
In case you haven't noticed

23:14.460 --> 23:17.495
I happen to be hosting
"The Tonight Show."

23:17.497 --> 23:19.764
Can't you take a message?

23:19.766 --> 23:21.632
It's Mr. Carson.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.334
[choking]

23:24.537 --> 23:26.237
Tell him I'm not here.

after these messages.

watching the show?

23:52.465 --> 23:54.064
Yeah? What do you think?

23:55.301 --> 23:58.436
Alright, alright, I'm sorry
I broke your cup.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.772
Have you been
enjoying the clips?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.040
Uh-huh.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.343
- Uh-huh.
- What'd he say?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.346
He said if I don't shape up

24:09.348 --> 24:11.882
he'll send over
a near-sighted veterinarian

24:11.884 --> 24:15.286
