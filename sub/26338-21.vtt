WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:03.046
Previously on MacGyver...

00:03.090 --> 00:06.441
Ethan Reigns is my husband.

00:08.660 --> 00:09.966
My name is Ethan Reigns.

00:10.010 --> 00:10.967
I'm making this video because

00:11.011 --> 00:12.751
tomorrow I start deep cover.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.971
Matty, I'm so sorry.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.190
S-Company knows there's an

00:16.233 --> 00:17.626
undercover CIA agent
in the ranks.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.715
They will kill you when
they find out it's you.

00:19.758 --> 00:21.847
- Nod if you understand.
- Ethan, what happened?

00:21.891 --> 00:23.719
- Daddy!
- I met Deena

00:23.762 --> 00:24.720
while I was undercover,

00:24.763 --> 00:26.548
and then our daughter was born.

00:26.591 --> 00:27.853
It just became my life.

00:27.897 --> 00:28.854
S-Company learned your location.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.160
It's no longer safe here.

00:30.204 --> 00:31.379
This part of Nebraska

00:31.422 --> 00:32.641
we're going to is
really beautiful.

00:32.683 --> 00:34.860
You'll never see me again.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.254
Bye, Matty.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.457 --> 01:08.155
Ooh.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.809
A slice of your
best pie, please.

01:10.853 --> 01:14.378
Got to check out the competition.
I've had it,

01:14.422 --> 01:16.641
I would not call it competition.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.904
Thanks so much
for meeting with me.

01:18.948 --> 01:20.993
Yeah, sure.
You said on the phone

01:21.037 --> 01:22.908
that you had something
of interest for the Phoenix.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.780
I'm here. I'm listening.

01:24.823 --> 01:27.348
My boy Billy and I have been
tracking a skip that jumped bail

01:27.391 --> 01:31.221
all the way across the Atlantic.
Name's Ryan Hayes.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.267
The billionaire's son suspected

01:33.310 --> 01:34.442
of funneling money to terrorists?

01:34.485 --> 01:36.835
Mm-hmm.
The DOJ has been trying to make

01:36.879 --> 01:38.185
a case against him for years.

01:38.228 --> 01:41.275
Then you know that he got busted
on drug charges.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.667
Posted bail,

01:42.711 --> 01:45.453
promptly hopped on
a private plane to Paris

01:45.496 --> 01:48.717
before his arrest could hit
the Fed's radar.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.327
I'm aware.

01:50.371 --> 01:52.373
It's my understanding that you
don't work internationally.

01:52.416 --> 01:53.678
We don't,

01:53.722 --> 01:55.376
which is why I was
thinking to myself,

01:55.419 --> 01:58.857
"Self," I said,
"taking a terrorist financier

01:58.901 --> 02:02.296
"off of the streets
might be of interest

02:02.339 --> 02:04.211
"to my favorite director

02:04.254 --> 02:07.388
of a secret spy organization."

02:07.431 --> 02:08.650
Am I right?

02:08.693 --> 02:12.175
Bagging Hayes would
definitely be a coup,

02:12.219 --> 02:15.787
and I suspect a high-profile
bust like this

02:15.831 --> 02:17.006
wouldn't hurt
the Coltons, either.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.748
Thank you.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.967
What do you need from me?

02:22.011 --> 02:24.274
Well, I was hoping that you
might loan me the talents

02:24.318 --> 02:25.536
of a certain young woman

02:25.580 --> 02:28.191
with a formidable set
of computer skills.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.891
Billy and Riley are
dating each other.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.111
Sending them on a mission
to Paris,

02:35.155 --> 02:36.591
they could get distracted.

02:36.634 --> 02:40.334
Distracted or not, the Coltons
always get their mark.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.162
Besides,

02:42.205 --> 02:43.772
Mama will be there to make sure

02:43.815 --> 02:46.383
that the Phoenix
gets their share.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.387
Mama...

02:51.258 --> 02:52.694
...you got yourself a deal.

02:52.737 --> 02:55.218
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.219
Ah!

02:56.263 --> 02:58.439
Ah!

03:04.096 --> 03:04.923
Okay,

03:04.967 --> 03:06.186
I did try to warn you.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.231
This is a tragedy.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.450
Agreed.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.279
Excuse me.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.155
Ethan?

03:20.809 --> 03:23.115
Where are you?

03:30.645 --> 03:33.474
Sorry. I didn't know who else to call.
What's happening?

03:33.517 --> 03:35.127
You're in WITSEC.

03:35.171 --> 03:37.086
You're not supposed
to contact me.

03:37.129 --> 03:40.263
S-Company found me.
They nabbed Mara and Deena.

03:40.307 --> 03:44.006
I'll have every resource on this
within an hour. No, you can't.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.182
They called with a ransom demand.
They said if I involved

03:46.226 --> 03:48.184
any agencies,
they'd kill them both.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.664
Who called?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.231
August Roth.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.540
What does he want? Since I left,

03:56.584 --> 03:58.368
he's been on a mission
to eradicate every mole

03:58.412 --> 03:59.804
in the organization.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.503
He's giving me 48 hours
to get him a list

04:02.546 --> 04:06.376
of every undercover CIA agent
currently with S-Company.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.899
But you don't have that list.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.119
Agents are sent in without
knowledge of each other

04:10.162 --> 04:13.253
for this very reason. I know.
That's why I contacted you.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.300
Tell me you're not about

04:17.344 --> 04:19.649
to ask me what I think
you're about to ask me.

04:19.694 --> 04:22.174
The lives of my wife
and child are at stake.

04:22.218 --> 04:25.874
You want to give Roth the list
of every undercover agent

04:25.917 --> 04:28.616
in his organization
and you want my help to do it.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.966
It has to be the real list.
He'll know if it's fake.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.489
Ethan, you give Roth that list,

04:32.533 --> 04:35.623
he'll kill every undercover
agent in his organization.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.320
Their blood will be
on your hands.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.322
I can't meet with Roth
without the list.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.281
And if I don't meet with him,

04:41.324 --> 04:43.892
there is no way to get
Deena and Mara back.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.677
I know what the stakes are.

04:46.721 --> 04:49.376
If I have to

04:49.419 --> 04:51.639
turn over the list,
I will do everything I can

04:51.682 --> 04:54.598
to warn all the men and women
who are on it.

04:54.642 --> 04:58.428
There's only person with that
list, the Director of the CIA.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.082
He carries it on his cell phone

05:00.125 --> 05:02.345
in an encrypted file so it's
never out of his sight.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.782
I know, that's why I'm
gonna steal it from him.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.828
What? But I can't do it alone.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.570
Ethan, what you're planning,

05:09.613 --> 05:11.485
what we're talking about

05:11.528 --> 05:13.356
is treason. I know.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.271
But there is no other way
to save my family.

05:17.839 --> 05:18.970
Will you help me?

05:49.740 --> 05:51.307
We had a meeting.
Where are you?

05:51.351 --> 05:52.961
Sorry, Jim.
Something came up.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.963
As in you're running late?

05:55.006 --> 05:56.268
As in I'm not coming in.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.314
I'm going off the grid
for a couple of days.

06:02.231 --> 06:03.841
What's in Virginia?

06:03.885 --> 06:05.974
Jim, don't track me.
Well, don't keep secrets from me.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.192
What's going on?

06:07.236 --> 06:09.586
I'm gonna need you
to trust me on this one.

06:09.630 --> 06:10.587
It's better that you don't know.

06:10.631 --> 06:11.588
That's not good enough.

06:11.632 --> 06:12.807
It's gonna have to be.

06:12.850 --> 06:13.982
What about the team?

06:14.025 --> 06:17.202
Jim, we can't have
this conversation.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.291
I'll take that as a yes. If you don't want
to be associated

06:19.335 --> 06:20.945
with an act of treason,

06:20.989 --> 06:23.339
then I suggest you hang up
this phone right now.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.340
Matty...

06:24.384 --> 06:26.386
That's all I'm gonna say.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.303
Good luck.

06:35.351 --> 06:36.700
Thank you.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.399
Don't thank me until your wife
and daughter are safe.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.713
Did Matty say where we were going?
No.

06:49.757 --> 06:50.714
Not yet.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.021
Hey.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.070
Okay, I need to ask.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.029
Are we really sure we want
to be involved in this?

07:01.072 --> 07:02.465
Because if we're caught,

07:02.509 --> 07:04.380
we're gonna be tried
as accomplices to treason.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.425
We'd spend the rest
of our lives in prison.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.774
And not one of the nice prisons.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.384
It'd be a bad one.
I hear what you're saying.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.039
Okay? But Matty knows
exactly what she's doing.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.040
Agreed.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.389
If Matty needs my help,

07:13.433 --> 07:14.477
then I'm gonna go help her.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.696
So if Matty goes to jail,

07:15.739 --> 07:16.697
you're willing to go with her?

07:16.740 --> 07:18.394
Only if we fail.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.570
Look, if we can find

07:20.614 --> 07:22.485
Mara and Deena
before the 48 hours are up,

07:22.529 --> 07:24.444
we avoid the whole treason thing
altogether.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.185
And if not?

07:27.229 --> 07:28.578
I call top bunk.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.406
Relax. Nobody's going to jail.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.497
Oh. There she is.

07:37.108 --> 07:40.068
Look, this mission
is volunteer-only.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.287
Disavow protocol
is in effect, so...

07:42.331 --> 07:43.288
it's up to you
if you want to go.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.855
But if you're not in...

07:44.899 --> 07:46.596
You should leave.

07:48.250 --> 07:48.990
Now.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.429
My job is to protect you all.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.432
So if you're going
on this insane mission,

07:56.476 --> 07:58.478
count me in.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.046
Hey, Matty.

08:02.090 --> 08:05.049
Mac, are you sure
you want to do this?

08:05.093 --> 08:06.964
If you're asking me to confirm
what I already told you,

08:07.008 --> 08:07.922
then, yes, I'm in.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.619
Me, too.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.535
Make that court-martial
for three.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.319
Putting you on speaker.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.974
What's the news?

08:17.018 --> 08:20.108
I managed to trace the phone
where the ransom call came from.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.544
So we know where August is?

08:21.588 --> 08:22.893
No, it's not gonna be that
easy, I'm afraid.

08:22.937 --> 08:24.895
August has become really careful

08:24.939 --> 08:26.244
since he took over S-Company.

08:26.288 --> 08:27.637
He doesn't even touch
his own phone.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.117
It's probably one
of his guys' phones.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.640
But this guy could know

08:30.684 --> 08:32.860
- where Deena and Mara are being held.
- Exactly.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.905
I uploaded the phone's location
to your tracking software.

08:37.385 --> 08:39.780
Okay, so it looks like our only
lead on Deena and Mara is

08:39.823 --> 08:41.433
taking us to Belarus.

08:41.477 --> 08:44.001
Look, I-I have to thank
all of you for risking

08:44.044 --> 08:46.090
your lives to help find my family.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.527
Ethan and I are going to get the list,

08:47.570 --> 08:50.051
but handing it over
to S-Company is a last resort.

08:50.094 --> 08:52.401
Only if you guys fail.

08:52.444 --> 08:53.489
So, Mac...

08:53.533 --> 08:55.186
Don't fail. Got it.

09:07.808 --> 09:10.201
Okay, I'm in their feed.

09:10.245 --> 09:13.204
We'll be able to see Hayes
coming from any entrance.

09:13.248 --> 09:16.338
We now have eyes on
every wineglass, cheese plate,

09:16.381 --> 09:19.428
steak au poivre.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.343
I might be getting hungry.

09:21.386 --> 09:22.692
Which tie?

09:25.434 --> 09:27.871
Um, does it matter?

09:27.915 --> 09:30.352
I mean, aren't we just waiting
for Hayes to show up and...

09:30.395 --> 09:31.396
grab him?

09:31.440 --> 09:33.485
Maybe. But there's a dress code,

09:33.529 --> 09:35.487
and they won't let me in
without a tie.

09:35.531 --> 09:39.013
Oh. Well, in that case,
definitely the gray.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.934
Oh, cut it out, you two.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.284
We're working here.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.025
Y'all got the surveillance set up

09:51.068 --> 09:52.504
and ready to go? We're all set.

09:52.548 --> 09:55.029
Yeah, well, hurry up and
finish getting dressed then.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.508
We don't have time for your...

09:56.552 --> 09:57.901
canoodling.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.381
Yes, Mama. Yes, Mama.

09:59.424 --> 10:00.425
Mm-hmm.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.651
Thank you.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.091
This place is...
very swanky.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.484
Well, bounty hunting

10:15.527 --> 10:18.487
isn't all dark alleys
and unwashed miscreants.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.620
I guess there's a few perks.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.537
Ooh, looks like Ryan Hayes
scored the best seat

10:25.581 --> 10:27.496
in the restaurant.

10:27.539 --> 10:28.584
Three o'clock.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.066
There's our guy.
Guess Daddy's money

10:32.109 --> 10:33.284
couldn't buy him
a better haircut.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.330
So what's the play?

10:35.373 --> 10:37.288
Wait till he goes
to the bathroom,

10:37.332 --> 10:38.463
drag him out the back door?

10:38.507 --> 10:40.291
His security would be
on us in a flash.

10:40.335 --> 10:43.425
For now, you're just gonna watch

10:43.468 --> 10:46.602
and you're gonna wait
until he's away from his detail.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.213
Well, I guess you're just

10:49.257 --> 10:50.562
forcing me to enjoy
a delicious meal

10:50.606 --> 10:51.563
and maybe some expensive wine.

10:51.607 --> 10:54.566
Well, ain't that just our luck?

10:56.220 --> 10:58.222
Oh, hold on, hold on.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.094
Somebody's joining him.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.665
Is this a date?

11:13.281 --> 11:14.804
Ava Malone.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.590
If this is a date,
his taste in women runs toward

11:18.634 --> 11:20.549
"on the watch list for working
with terrorist groups."

11:20.592 --> 11:21.637
Oh.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.205
Surely this couldn't end badly.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.468
My guess is Matty would love
to sweep both those people up.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.730
Hmm. And you'll never hear

11:27.774 --> 11:30.341
Mama complain
about two bounties.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.604
We need ears on
that conversation.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.652
Latest tech.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.219
Top of the line.

11:38.262 --> 11:41.222
Sticks to any surface and
connects to an app on my phone.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.571
How are we gonna
get this near them?

11:42.614 --> 11:43.746
Sommelier.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.575
He's breaking out
the good stuff tonight.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.665
Do you think you can get this
device on their wine bottle?

11:51.058 --> 11:52.668
You just watch
how smooth I can be.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.452
Yeah, well,
whatever you're gonna do,

11:54.496 --> 11:55.758
you better do it fast,

11:55.802 --> 11:57.542
'cause sommelier is on the move.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.899
Hey, sorry to bother you,
I'm on an

12:05.942 --> 12:08.466
extremely important date
and I'm looking to impress

12:08.510 --> 12:09.946
the woman I'm with and I need

12:09.990 --> 12:11.731
some serious help selecting
the bottle of wine.

12:11.774 --> 12:13.558
Now, would...

12:13.602 --> 12:16.300
would this be the one you'd recommend?
This bottle is already

12:16.344 --> 12:18.694
spoken for, but I am
happy to stop by your table

12:18.738 --> 12:20.565
in a moment. You're too kind.
Thank you, sir.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.400
The house's finest wine, sir.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.706
Perfect, thank you.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.596
You see?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.729
Smooth.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.817
You sure are.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.819
Real smooth.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.213
Trust me, I have
what you're looking for.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.823
I'll need to see it.
Tonight.

13:00.867 --> 13:04.305
Fine. We can meet with
my associate after dinner.

13:04.348 --> 13:05.697
He's ready and waiting. They're doing
a deal.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.438
Tonight. Whatever it's about,

13:07.482 --> 13:09.223
it could be
any number of things.

13:09.266 --> 13:10.528
All bad, cascading to worse.

13:10.572 --> 13:11.703
We should just grab them
both right now.

13:11.747 --> 13:12.922
No, no.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.532
We're gonna wait
until after the purchase.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.317
That way we can get them

13:16.360 --> 13:18.536
and the package.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.712
For now, you just
follow them discreetly,

13:20.756 --> 13:22.453
wait until they're alone,

13:22.497 --> 13:24.151
thenyou get them.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.196
Practice your patience.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.650
Looks like the place.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.348
Whoever made the ransom call
to Ethan is definitely

13:47.391 --> 13:49.176
- in this building.
- Why do creepy bad guys

13:49.219 --> 13:50.699
always work out of warehouses?

13:50.742 --> 13:52.266
I mean, is there
a commercial realtor

13:52.309 --> 13:54.877
- who specializes in secret lairs?
- Are you done?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.923
Because it looks like
S-Company's having a party

13:56.966 --> 13:58.576
and we are definitely outnumbered.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.404
Follow me.

14:14.549 --> 14:17.334
Is that... cheering?

14:23.688 --> 14:25.386
It stinks in here.

14:25.429 --> 14:28.302
Smells like disappointment
and failure.

14:30.826 --> 14:34.308
Well, the guy we're looking for
is definitely here somewhere.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.484
All right, well, let's split
up, signal when you find him,

14:36.527 --> 14:38.355
then we'll evac
and interrogate, okay?

14:53.457 --> 14:56.112
Yeah! Yeah!

14:56.156 --> 14:57.331
I think I got him, guys,

14:57.374 --> 14:59.289
but I think he's about to...
run!

14:59.333 --> 15:00.160
Damn it.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.135
Get off.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.703
Listen very carefully,
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.

15:21.746 --> 15:23.705
Where is Roth holding
Ethan Reigns's family?

15:36.022 --> 15:37.284
That's it.

15:37.327 --> 15:38.720
Okay, so the first step

15:38.763 --> 15:40.417
is getting you inside the building

15:40.461 --> 15:42.463
but that requires
an access badge to swipe in.

15:42.506 --> 15:43.507
Don't worry, I got this.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.512
I do, I do have that form, yes.

15:48.556 --> 15:49.557
Mm-hmm.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.126
Mm-hmm. Okay.

15:53.169 --> 15:56.346
Okay, so that's the form
you need. Let me see... Oh.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.044
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'll give you a hand.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.829
Um. Ow. Don,
I have to go.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.007
Ah, you don't have to do that.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.574
Thank you so much.
Okay.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.619
Appreciate your time.
Yeah, have a good one.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.015
Just like old times.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.496
Hey, don't get cocky.
That was the easy part.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.237
What's next?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.587
Director Huang is on
the top floor of the building.

16:19.630 --> 16:20.805
Access requires

16:20.849 --> 16:22.459
a six-digit security code

16:22.503 --> 16:24.896
and that code changes
every 60 seconds.

16:24.940 --> 16:28.900
You're gonna need to lay your
hands on an OTP secure key fob.

16:28.944 --> 16:31.512
Only a few select people in
the building have access to it.

16:31.555 --> 16:34.515
Okay, so who is the fancy-pants
with my fob?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.084
Tenth floor, end of the hall.

16:38.127 --> 16:42.697
The guy's name is Brad Stewart.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.570
Okay, looks like the mark
is in his office.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.398
Any suggestions?

16:52.228 --> 16:53.969
Brad Stewart.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.363
What?

16:56.406 --> 16:58.800
Be right down.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.025
Well, he left in quite a hurry.
What did you say to him?

17:06.068 --> 17:09.463
That his mistress was downstairs
threatening to call his wife.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.030
How did you know
he had a mistress?

17:11.073 --> 17:12.074
Lucky guess.

17:12.117 --> 17:13.162
Okay, now hurry up.

17:18.602 --> 17:21.605
You might want to have a
talk with whoever runs security

17:21.648 --> 17:22.606
for this place when we're done.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.044
Cute, but this next step

17:25.087 --> 17:26.088
is the hardest one.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.523
Director Huang always travels

17:27.568 --> 17:28.743
with two guards.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.310
I hope you've done
your finger stretches

17:30.353 --> 17:32.529
'cause you're gonna need
to lift the phone off of him

17:32.573 --> 17:34.488
without any of them noticing.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.664
Still got it.

17:36.707 --> 17:37.665
You there!

17:37.708 --> 17:38.622
Stop!

17:38.666 --> 17:40.320
Ethan, what was that?

17:43.149 --> 17:44.454
Hi.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.329
So who's down for a beer?

17:49.372 --> 17:51.026
I'm buying.

17:57.859 --> 18:01.471
Why is Director Huang
unconscious in my van?

18:01.515 --> 18:03.778
Proximity sensor went off
when I was five feet away,

18:03.821 --> 18:06.041
and all I could think of was to
take out his security detail.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.348
And abduct the
director of the CIA?

18:08.391 --> 18:09.523
Will you yell at me after
we get away, please?

18:25.582 --> 18:26.975
Okay, thanks, Mac.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.629
Keep in touch.

18:30.674 --> 18:34.939
Well, the good news is he has
no idea you're involved.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.376
Only you can find
the silver lining

18:36.419 --> 18:37.942
in abducting
the director of the CIA.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.422
You're positive
that we're safe here?

18:39.466 --> 18:40.902
Phoenix hasn't used
this safe house in years.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.470
We can lay low while we
figure out our next move.

18:43.513 --> 18:44.993
You heard from the team?

18:45.036 --> 18:46.560
Well, Mac says they have a lead

18:46.603 --> 18:48.214
on where they're holding
Deena and Mara.

18:48.257 --> 18:49.824
A house in Minsk.
They're on their way there now.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.609
Any luck cracking the passcode
on the phone?

18:52.653 --> 18:54.829
No. We're locked out.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.831
I think the proximity
sensor probably set off

18:56.874 --> 18:58.441
another layer of encryption.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.791
Chances are it's a passcode
only the director knows.

19:00.835 --> 19:03.011
Yeah. So I'm gonna have
to figure out a way

19:03.054 --> 19:04.839
to get him to tell
me what it is.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.406
We still have 24 hours.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.755
We could wait to hear from Mac,

19:07.798 --> 19:09.148
and with any luck,
we may not need

19:09.191 --> 19:11.062
that list after all.
Until your team has my family

19:11.106 --> 19:13.021
in hand, I can't
take that chance.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.283
You don't know Roth like I do.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.807
He's vengeful, he's ruthless.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.462
He thinks I betrayed him
and now he has my family.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.421
We're gonna get them back.
Ethan.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.597
Ethan...

19:23.640 --> 19:25.033
You trust me, right?

19:25.076 --> 19:27.078
Yeah.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.342
Okay. Well, I trust Mac.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.779
He's gonna find Deena and Mara.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.565
That's good.

19:37.480 --> 19:41.484
But I have to do everything
I can in case he fails.

19:41.528 --> 19:45.053
So now I'm gonna go interrogate
the director of the CIA,

19:45.096 --> 19:47.447
and hope like hell that your
team can get my family back

19:47.490 --> 19:49.710
before we have to
turn over this list.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.501
Deena and Mara
got to be in there.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.155
This place is like Fort Knox.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.983
I know what you mean. I made two
hostiles at the front entrance,

20:02.026 --> 20:04.159
and there's no back door.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.856
Plus four supersized armed guys
inside guarding

20:05.900 --> 20:07.075
the bedroom toward the back.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.164
All the windows

20:09.208 --> 20:11.166
are covered in bars except

20:11.210 --> 20:12.776
that one is the only one
that's blacked out.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.213
And if you say there's four

20:14.256 --> 20:16.780
supersized armed guys
stationed around that room,

20:16.824 --> 20:17.955
it's got to be
where they're holding

20:17.999 --> 20:19.696
Ethan's wife and daughter.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.307
So how do we Batman ourselves
in to save Ethan's family?

20:21.350 --> 20:22.699
If we breach any entrance,

20:22.743 --> 20:24.832
we risk the guards inside
killing Ethan's family

20:24.875 --> 20:26.094
before getting even close.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.226
We can't go through the window

20:27.269 --> 20:28.575
because of the heavy bars.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.753
So...

20:32.796 --> 20:35.364
we, uh,
get rid of the heavy bars.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.980
I'm gonna need that bike.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.374
Okay, I see what's
going on here.

20:45.418 --> 20:46.636
Like a E.T. thing.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.508
Not even close.
Grab that hose.

20:48.551 --> 20:51.162
Those metal bars would've been
driven into the brick

20:51.206 --> 20:52.990
with heavy-duty masonry anchors.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.863
Which means it would take a
lot of force to pull them out.

20:55.906 --> 20:58.605
That nylon garden hose, though
it doesn't look like much,

20:58.648 --> 21:00.433
will work with the pulleys
and the gears

21:00.476 --> 21:02.739
to give us a mechanical
advantage,

21:02.783 --> 21:05.220
even against something
as strong as those steel bars.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.483
Get ready to start cranking.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.920
Once these bars come out,
we're gonna have to move fast.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.562
It's okay, it's okay.
We're here to get you out of here.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.520
Where's Mara?
I don't know.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.087
They took her somewhere else.No...

21:46.130 --> 21:48.176
Mac, I don't know how much
this door's gonna hold.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.091
We need to leave. Now.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.892
What's going on?

22:09.806 --> 22:11.721
Well, nothing yet.

22:11.765 --> 22:12.940
Doesn't look like
they've made the exchange.

22:12.983 --> 22:14.637
You know what I mean.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.160
You're acting weird.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.684
Well, yeah.
We've been waiting outside

22:17.727 --> 22:19.947
of this club for hours
for Hayes and Malone

22:19.990 --> 22:21.209
to pick up the package.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.819
You know what I'm talking about, Riley.

22:22.863 --> 22:25.692
You haven't said two words to me
since we left the restaurant.

22:25.735 --> 22:28.347
What gives?

22:32.612 --> 22:34.614
I'm just focused on the mission.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.405
They just made the exchange.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.712
They're heading
towards the exit now.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.933
Mama, looks like Hayes and
Malone got what they came for.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.326
They're on the move.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.110
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You might want to wait a beat

22:53.154 --> 22:54.634
before following. We don't have time.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.157
They got what they came for.
If we don't move now,

22:56.200 --> 22:58.202
we're gonna lose them.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.249
Come on.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.555
Get us out of here.
Go! Go! Go!

23:02.598 --> 23:04.426
They made us.
They won't get far.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.868
Thanks, Mac.

23:16.786 --> 23:17.961
What? What is it? What happened?

23:18.005 --> 23:21.312
My team infiltrated
the S-Company house.

23:22.531 --> 23:23.489
Deena's safe.

23:23.532 --> 23:26.666
What about Mara?

23:26.709 --> 23:28.668
She's being held
at a second location,

23:28.711 --> 23:30.234
and we don't know where that is.

23:32.976 --> 23:35.414
August knew. He knew
that I would try to rescue them,

23:35.457 --> 23:37.067
so he separated them
as an insurance policy.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.721
Now he knows
that I brought people in,

23:38.765 --> 23:39.940
and he's gonna kill her.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.768
No. He still wants the NOC list.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.639
He's not gonna kill her, not yet.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.598
Have you been able to get
the passcode from the director? No.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.251
You know, I would be impressed

23:47.295 --> 23:48.775
at his ability
to withhold information

23:48.818 --> 23:51.038
were it not endangering
my daughter's life.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.391
I've tried everything
short of getting aggressive.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.483
But that's probably
our only option now.

24:01.527 --> 24:04.704
Well, there's still one thing
we haven't tried.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.667
Director Webber?

24:11.711 --> 24:14.583
Director Huang, I kidnapped you,
and I'm sorry about that.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.193
Youkidnapped me?

24:16.237 --> 24:17.891
I don't understand. Why?

24:17.934 --> 24:20.589
I have an opportunity
to take out S-Company.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.722
Everyone from
August Roth on down.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.637
We can eradicate an organization

24:24.680 --> 24:27.030
that has terrorized
this world for years,

24:27.074 --> 24:30.904
but in order to do that,
I need your help.

24:30.947 --> 24:33.123
You know that I take
carefully calculated risks,

24:33.167 --> 24:35.822
and they're always
for a good cause.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.780
And so I'm asking you

24:37.824 --> 24:39.042
to trust me.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.217
If you give me access

24:40.261 --> 24:41.697
to the information
on your phone,

24:41.741 --> 24:45.788
it's possible that we could
finally take down S-Company.

24:45.832 --> 24:48.182
Allof S-Company.

24:48.225 --> 24:50.967
For good.

25:25.872 --> 25:26.742
Riley, you might want to slow...

25:26.786 --> 25:28.135
Who's driving, Billy? You or me?

25:28.178 --> 25:29.615
All I'm saying is,
it's hard to collect a bounty

25:29.658 --> 25:30.659
from beyond the grave.

25:37.013 --> 25:39.320
We can't keep this up forever.
At some point, we're gonna draw

25:39.363 --> 25:41.104
the attention of law enforcement.

25:41.148 --> 25:44.151
No cops. They make a mess
and get between me and my money.

25:44.194 --> 25:45.805
Don't worry, Mama.
I got an idea.

25:50.113 --> 25:52.159
Riley,
you can't crash into their SUV.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.334
Relax. I'm not hitting them.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.380
One down. I thought you
said you weren't gonna hit 'em.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.817
I didn't. That was a love tap.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.341
Uh-huh.
They're getting away. Like hell they are.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.172
Mama, where are you?

26:05.215 --> 26:06.739
Trying to catch up.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.175
Take Rue de Gaulle.
I'll try to box them in.

26:08.218 --> 26:09.785
Roger, darling.

26:30.937 --> 26:33.461
Now this can go nice and easy,

26:33.504 --> 26:35.289
or it can go rough.

26:36.464 --> 26:39.380
Your choice.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.908
Smart choice.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.606
Now get out of the car
and put your hands up

26:47.649 --> 26:49.608
where I can see 'em.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.958
Riley, cuff 'em.

26:52.001 --> 26:56.702
Billy, they make
one move, drill 'em.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.660
Yes, ma'am.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.836
Mm.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.623
All's quiet out back.
How's Deena?

27:04.666 --> 27:06.407
Pretty good,
all things considered.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.191
When do Matty and Ethan land?

27:15.372 --> 27:18.158
Where is she? Deena?

27:18.201 --> 27:20.203
Ethan. I'm here.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.077
Are you okay?
I am.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.382
Yeah?
They have Mara.

27:25.426 --> 27:26.949
They have Mara.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.518
- Have you been able to locate Mara?
- No.

27:30.561 --> 27:33.390
Deena said that shortly
after August abducted them,

27:33.434 --> 27:36.002
they were separated, and she has
no idea where he took her.

27:42.835 --> 27:43.879
This is Ethan.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.054
Reigns.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.230
August.

27:47.274 --> 27:50.190
You betrayed me... again.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.018
Now,

27:52.061 --> 27:54.803
if I was you, I'd think
of something real sweet to say

27:54.847 --> 27:56.979
to my daughter because
these will be the last...

27:57.023 --> 27:58.589
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

27:58.633 --> 27:59.939
Wait. I have the list.

27:59.982 --> 28:02.376
I have the CIA director's
phone right here.

28:02.419 --> 28:05.161
I will hand it over. Please,
just don't hurt her. Don't.

28:05.205 --> 28:07.294
August?

28:07.337 --> 28:09.339
August?

28:10.384 --> 28:13.039
Please just don't hurt her.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.134
I'm sending coordinates.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.223
You have one hour

28:23.266 --> 28:24.398
to get there with the phone.

28:24.441 --> 28:26.226
Don't be late.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.796
How did you get

28:30.839 --> 28:32.232
the director of the CIA

28:32.275 --> 28:34.147
to hand over the passcode
to his cell phone?

28:34.190 --> 28:35.539
I made him a deal.

28:35.583 --> 28:36.889
In exchange for the list,

28:36.932 --> 28:39.021
I promised him that we
would take down August

28:39.065 --> 28:41.110
and every last member
of S-Company.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.330
Every last member?

28:43.373 --> 28:45.201
From root to treetop.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.203
Okay, am I the only one
that thinks that's insane?

28:47.247 --> 28:48.683
I mean, we're supposed
to do that on our own?

28:48.727 --> 28:50.250
No.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.252
That's why
Director Huang called me.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.080
Jim, what are you doing here?

28:54.123 --> 28:55.472
You told me not
to ask any questions,

28:55.516 --> 28:58.345
so I'm gonna ask you
to do the same, Matty.

28:58.388 --> 28:59.955
Just know you have
the full resources

28:59.999 --> 29:01.652
of the CIA and Phoenix
at your disposal.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.048
August just sent
the coordinates.

29:06.092 --> 29:08.181
Here.

29:08.224 --> 29:09.878
All right...

29:10.923 --> 29:12.620
Oh, yeah. Look.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.013
It's an amphitheater.
Should be empty right now.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.362
If we get there early,

29:15.405 --> 29:16.363
we can set up a perimeter,

29:16.406 --> 29:17.538
be ready for when August arrives.

29:17.581 --> 29:18.539
Yeah.

29:18.582 --> 29:19.932
Sure, except, to get Mara back,

29:19.975 --> 29:21.716
we still have to physically
hand over the phone

29:21.760 --> 29:23.718
with the list of agents
so August can verify it.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.241
What happens
if the op goes south

29:25.285 --> 29:27.243
and August gets away
with that entire list?

29:27.287 --> 29:28.462
That's why
we need to be prepared

29:28.505 --> 29:30.246
for every possible contingency,

29:30.290 --> 29:32.118
especiallythe worst ones.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.423
Mac?

29:33.467 --> 29:36.383
I've got a plan, but, um,

29:36.426 --> 29:38.341
I'm gonna need to make a stop.

29:39.386 --> 29:41.823
Gum. Is that it for you?

29:43.477 --> 29:44.826
It's usually all I need.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.441
All right, everybody check in.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.925
Yup,
Ethan and I are in position.

29:58.492 --> 30:01.190
Overwatch in position.

30:01.234 --> 30:03.149
Look alive, people.

30:03.192 --> 30:05.804
We have a vehicle
coming towards us.

30:07.327 --> 30:10.460
I got one male, 40s.

30:10.504 --> 30:13.463
I can't tell if he's carrying,
but it's not August.

30:13.507 --> 30:14.856
He appears to be alone.

30:14.900 --> 30:18.512
No sign of Mara
or August with him.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.602
Where's my daughter?

30:21.645 --> 30:23.865
You're not really in a position
to ask questions, are you?

30:23.909 --> 30:25.301
Now get in the car.

30:25.345 --> 30:26.476
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Where is Mara?

30:26.520 --> 30:27.869
I'm just the driver.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.002
August sent me
to bring you to him.

30:30.045 --> 30:33.527
You didn't actually think this
was the meeting place, did you?

30:33.570 --> 30:36.269
Come on, Ethan.
You know better than that.

30:36.312 --> 30:37.748
You changed the deal.

30:37.792 --> 30:38.793
We need proof of life.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.099
And who the hell are you?

30:40.142 --> 30:41.578
I'm the guy in charge
of the phone

30:41.622 --> 30:42.666
holding the list
that your boss wants,

30:42.710 --> 30:44.190
so I'm along for the ride.

30:44.233 --> 30:48.194
Now, provide us with proof
of life, or the deal is off.

30:51.588 --> 30:54.983
What you got
in your pocket, cowboy?

30:59.074 --> 31:00.859
Daddy! Please come and get me.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.600
There. Proof of life.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.255
Now tell
whatever backup you brought

31:06.299 --> 31:08.170
to stand down and
get in the car.

31:10.085 --> 31:13.262
Stand down.

31:15.308 --> 31:17.440
If I see a
follow car or a chopper,

31:17.484 --> 31:19.921
these two and the little girl

31:19.965 --> 31:22.750
will all be buried
in the same hole together.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.535
Let's go.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.631
Get a satellite on them now.

31:34.675 --> 31:37.591
Wait. That's it? We're just letting
them drive away? We have to trust

31:37.634 --> 31:40.420
that Mac and Ethan
can take care of themselves,

31:40.463 --> 31:43.902
and hope that the satellite
finds them in time.

32:00.614 --> 32:01.745
The list.

32:01.789 --> 32:02.746
Not until I see Mara.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.661
You don't call the shots here.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.402
The list.

32:27.641 --> 32:29.034
It's here.

32:29.077 --> 32:32.341
Looks like your daughter
might live after all.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.952
The deal was Mara for the list.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.083
Hand her over, and we can

32:35.127 --> 32:36.171
get out of here.
Not yet.

32:36.215 --> 32:38.173
If I let you go
before he uploads

32:38.217 --> 32:40.654
the list to my men, you'll just
warn your other operatives.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.395
I can't let that happen.

32:44.397 --> 32:48.140
Not when I'm going to kill
every last one of them.

32:50.664 --> 32:53.623
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
It's just chewing gum.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.148
If you want a piece, just ask.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.194
Something's wrong.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.456
Cell battery's overheating,

33:00.500 --> 33:02.067
preventing upload.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.111
It's him.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.114
Yeah, that was me.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.682
When I pulled the gum out,
the gum foil acted

33:08.725 --> 33:11.032
as a conductor and allowed
a circuit to complete

33:11.076 --> 33:13.339
and turn on
a DIY spark-gap generator

33:13.382 --> 33:15.906
that fried that cell phone's
battery and prevented

33:15.950 --> 33:17.734
these guys
from uploading the list.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.214
What are you doing?

33:19.258 --> 33:21.564
Hopefully, buying enough time.

33:26.265 --> 33:27.440
Don't move!

33:27.483 --> 33:28.441
Hands where we can see them!

33:28.484 --> 33:29.442
Kill the girl.

33:29.485 --> 33:30.269
No! No!

35:05.451 --> 35:06.626
Dad!

35:19.204 --> 35:20.770
This is what happens
to traitors.

35:24.992 --> 35:28.300
Drop the knife, or I blow a hole
through your skull.

35:28.343 --> 35:29.431
Now!

35:41.835 --> 35:43.924
Took you long enough.
Thought you said you had it.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.234
Daddy!

35:50.278 --> 35:52.541
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

35:52.585 --> 35:55.414
Yeah? You sure?

35:55.457 --> 35:57.416
You want to see Mommy?

35:59.374 --> 36:03.596
August will be going
away for roughly, oh...

36:03.639 --> 36:05.075
forever.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.294
Hey, and thanks
to your gum trick,

36:06.338 --> 36:09.123
we stopped the NOC list
from spreading wide.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.299
The undercover agents are safe
and finally coming home.

36:11.343 --> 36:14.084
Yeah. Andyou get to keep
your deal with Director Huang.

36:14.128 --> 36:15.347
Since August tried

36:15.390 --> 36:17.349
to upload the list
to his network,

36:17.392 --> 36:20.395
our techs were able to use that
exact same network to track down

36:20.439 --> 36:22.876
every S-Company
branch worldwide.

36:22.919 --> 36:25.270
Sounds like
S-Company's out of business.

36:31.058 --> 36:33.060
We'll give you a second.

36:38.805 --> 36:40.807
Tonight is
the first night in years

36:40.850 --> 36:44.202
that I'm gonna be able to sleep
knowing that my family is safe.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.986
Thanks to you.

36:46.029 --> 36:47.814
I'm glad.

36:47.857 --> 36:49.294
But I hope you understand

36:49.337 --> 36:52.471
what I had to do
in order to make this happen.

36:52.514 --> 36:55.256
I kidnapped the director
of the CIA in broad daylight.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.606
I committed treason
against my country.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.174
Somebody's got to go
to jail for that.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.697
But...

37:01.741 --> 37:03.090
as long as my family's safe,

37:03.133 --> 37:05.179
I'd do it all again
in a heartbeat.

37:13.056 --> 37:14.144
Ethan...

37:14.188 --> 37:17.235
Can I say good-bye to my family?
Sure.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.603
So, I have to admit...

37:37.646 --> 37:40.301
I was wrong.

37:40.345 --> 37:41.563
Sorry?

37:41.607 --> 37:43.130
My hearing must be off,

37:43.173 --> 37:45.306
or maybe I'm
in some sort of fugue state.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.307
I shouldn't have

37:46.351 --> 37:49.223
questioned Matty's judgment.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.007
I mean,
she did what she had to do.

37:51.051 --> 37:52.226
She got the job done.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.141
Matty would
never let her feelings

37:54.184 --> 37:55.751
get in the way of a job.

37:55.795 --> 37:57.144
Her top priority is
this country's safety,

37:57.187 --> 37:58.972
so she'll do what's right

37:59.015 --> 38:00.147
no matter what
the personal cost.

38:00.190 --> 38:03.455
Sounds like someone else I know.

38:03.498 --> 38:06.284
You mean someone
who breaks cell phones

38:06.327 --> 38:07.328
and all of my blenders?

38:08.851 --> 38:10.200
Exactly that someone.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.898
That's gonna leave a mark.Yeah.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.073
Yeah.Yeah.

38:21.386 --> 38:23.257
Hey.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.433
Hey.

38:25.477 --> 38:27.000
Courtesy of Mama.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.436
Thanks for your help.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.091
I just delivered one
to Matty as well.

38:31.134 --> 38:33.093
Tell Mama thank you for me.

38:35.748 --> 38:37.010
You know, something must be
wrong with your phone.

38:37.053 --> 38:39.099
It keeps sending me
to voice mail.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.883
Luckily, Matty knew
where you were,

38:40.927 --> 38:43.886
so I came by to deliver
that pie in person.

38:43.930 --> 38:47.150
That... and to see
your beautiful face.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.376
So, when can I see you again?

38:55.420 --> 38:56.986
You got to admit,

38:57.030 --> 38:59.424
it's fun working together. I did have fun.

38:59.467 --> 39:02.296
But I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.475
Oh.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.564
Okay, that's...

39:09.608 --> 39:11.349
out of left field.

39:12.872 --> 39:16.615
Riley, can we talk
about how this came about? I'd rather not.

39:18.051 --> 39:20.445
I don't want to make this
harder on either of us.

39:26.015 --> 39:27.365
If this is what
you really want...

39:27.408 --> 39:28.888
It is.

39:56.742 --> 39:59.397
You okay?

40:00.920 --> 40:03.488
How much did you hear?

40:03.531 --> 40:06.099
Enough. Sorry, I was
actually just coming in

40:06.142 --> 40:07.970
to get another round,
I didn't mean to...

40:08.014 --> 40:09.450
It's complicated.

40:11.409 --> 40:14.020
Billy was seeing someone else.

40:16.109 --> 40:18.024
Found out on the mission. Riley,

40:18.067 --> 40:20.592
that's awful. Just give me a second
before you tell Bozer.

40:20.635 --> 40:22.028
He's gonna want to burn things

40:22.071 --> 40:24.639
or key his truck...
I just need some time

40:24.683 --> 40:26.467
to deal with this on my own. You don't have

40:26.511 --> 40:28.164
to tell anyone yet, okay?

40:28.208 --> 40:29.775
Just... Whatever you need.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.603
You need to cry, cry.

40:31.646 --> 40:33.866
You need to...
to burn stuff,

40:33.909 --> 40:35.171
I'll make you some matches.No.

40:35.215 --> 40:38.436
No, he's not worth
my time or my energy.

40:38.479 --> 40:41.134
I just want
to focus on moving on.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.658
That's all. Okay?

40:46.574 --> 40:48.489
It's sad.

40:48.533 --> 40:51.927
The one man who's always
been there for me is Jack...

40:51.971 --> 40:53.494
and now he's not here.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.587
I feel lost.
Oh, Riley.

41:04.331 --> 41:06.028
You got me.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.813
You have Matty...

41:07.856 --> 41:09.423
Bozer...

41:09.467 --> 41:11.164
and...

41:11.207 --> 41:12.861
...possibly Desi,
I don't know,

41:12.905 --> 41:14.820
she's kind of hard to read.

41:14.863 --> 41:17.257
But what I'm trying to say

41:17.300 --> 41:19.259
is that weare here.

41:19.302 --> 41:21.522
So if you are lost,

41:21.566 --> 41:23.437
we'll help you find yourself.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.830
Okay?

41:25.831 --> 41:27.180
Thanks.

41:27.223 --> 41:28.573
Always.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.099
So...

41:33.142 --> 41:34.230
are we burning stuff?

41:56.557 --> 41:58.298
You took a big risk.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.562
And it paid off.

42:01.606 --> 42:02.824
We finally dismantled

42:02.868 --> 42:04.870
S-Company for good.

42:04.913 --> 42:06.262
They can never harm
Ethan's family

42:06.306 --> 42:08.308
or anyone else ever again.

42:08.351 --> 42:10.702
Sometimes our job
requires sacrifice.

42:10.745 --> 42:13.443
But the world is a safer place

42:13.487 --> 42:15.097
because of you.

42:15.141 --> 42:16.838
And you should
feel good about that.

42:16.882 --> 42:18.666
I wish I did.

42:18.710 --> 42:22.540
Well, I know something that
might make you feel better.

42:24.106 --> 42:25.325
Slice?
Please.

42:28.328 --> 42:29.459
Apple.

42:29.503 --> 42:30.765
My favorite.

42:37.337 --> 42:38.425
Seriously?

42:38.468 --> 42:40.862
You call thata slice?

42:42.211 --> 42:43.822
I can fix that.Good.

42:43.865 --> 42:45.345
'Cause I'm hungry.

42:45.388 --> 42:46.476
It's all yours. Bring it.
