A Sicilian woman and
an Arab trader fell in love.

12:26.637 --> 12:30.136
But the Arab had a wife
and children back in Tunisia.

12:30.220 --> 12:33.720
So he told the Sicilian woman
that he loved her,

12:33.804 --> 12:35.595
but he had to go back
to his family.

12:35.679 --> 12:38.470

the Sicilian woman

12:38.553 --> 12:42.261
cut off his head
while he was sleeping.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.804
She hollowed out his brains,

12:43.887 --> 12:46.887
and she turned his skull
into a pot,

12:46.970 --> 12:48.887

48:40.011 --> 48:43.679
Or else you might miss
the significance.

I'm not sure
subjecting the artist

48:45.804 --> 48:48.011
to some dime-store
interpretation is the way to--

48:48.095 --> 48:49.637
Sometimes.

48:49.720 --> 48:52.595
But sometimes you
find someone who--

48:52.679 --> 48:55.220
who has an eye,
who gets it.

50:07.303 --> 50:08.637
Bar fight?

50:08.720 --> 50:10.387
It was just after seeing
Y Tu Mamá También.

50:10.470 --> 50:12.053
In a theater.
I was all hopped up,

50:12.136 --> 50:14.095
and some kid--
Willard Broxton--

50:14.178 --> 50:16.637
from my high school went into
his usual routine,

50:16.720 --> 50:18.804
ripping into me.
And I just decided, not today.

50:18.887 --> 50:20.095
Did you throw
the first punch?

50:20.178 --> 50:21.637
The only punch, yes.

50:21.720 --> 50:23.887
And swore never again to
give in to that emotion.

50:23.970 --> 50:25.470
I also haven't watched
that movie again

50:25.553 --> 50:26.720
for fear of what
it might provoke.

50:26.804 --> 50:28.553
Like Axe
and Magnum Force!

50:28.637 --> 50:31.178
Yeah.
But tell me.

50:31.261 --> 50:34.387
You don't usually traffic in
tales of pugilism and cinema.

50:34.470 --> 50:35.387
Something
you want to say?

50:35.470 --> 50:37.261
There is. Yes.

50:37.345 --> 50:39.720
You will see a loss from
Mase Carbon on the books today.

50:39.804 --> 50:41.095
It will grow.

50:41.178 --> 50:44.011
[sniffs]
Those are fighting words.

50:44.095 --> 50:45.637
Was it because you had to
look after our shop?

50:45.720 --> 50:47.804
No. I can't blame Vigilantrix
for this.

50:47.887 --> 50:49.929
And the loss isn't
a one-time thing.

50:50.011 --> 50:51.178
We are going to carry it
for a while.

50:51.261 --> 50:52.553
Prince and I
put our heads together

50:52.637 --> 50:54.136
on the impact scandal--
Prince?!

50:54.220 --> 50:55.845
Wendy and I made a calculated
risk to work with him

50:55.929 --> 50:57.887
because there was real
long-term upside.

50:57.970 --> 51:00.345
You mis-fucking-calculated.
What happened?

51:00.428 --> 51:02.345
Prince convinced me
to take the short-term hit

51:02.428 --> 51:04.095
in order to rebuild
Shine-Lucence publicly

51:04.178 --> 51:06.136
and preserve the pristine
reputation of Mase Carbon--

51:06.220 --> 51:07.679
actually, that's not strictly
what happened.

51:07.762 --> 51:09.720
I volunteered.
No, you didn't.

51:09.804 --> 51:11.595
Even if you think
you did.

51:11.679 --> 51:14.178
Yeah, and if you did,

51:14.261 --> 51:16.011
it's 'cause
he wanted you to.

51:16.095 --> 51:17.762
Tell it.
That's not how it happened.

51:17.845 --> 51:19.720
I think maybe the half-life
of that Vigilantrix

51:19.804 --> 51:20.637
is making you angsty.

51:20.720 --> 51:22.095
Nope. Born this way.

51:22.178 --> 51:23.428
Stoked it. Intentionally.

51:23.512 --> 51:24.887
I preserve it.
I know.

51:24.970 --> 51:27.595
But Prince: He almost ate
the entire loss himself,

51:27.679 --> 51:29.303
to buy me out of
the company.

51:29.387 --> 51:30.970
But then I saw the sagacity
in his plan, and I insisted--

51:31.053 --> 51:33.303
Textbook fucking
manipulation.

51:33.387 --> 51:35.553
He played you.
And me by extension.

51:35.637 --> 51:37.136
He duped you into
taking that loss.

51:37.220 --> 51:39.553
And now that's on
my fucking sheet.

51:39.637 --> 51:42.720
I bet he'd already
pared his position

51:42.804 --> 51:46.595
before all this going public
with the story bullshit started.

51:46.679 --> 51:48.553
Sounds to me like
an act of war.

51:48.637 --> 51:50.261
Sounds that way
because it is that way.

51:50.345 --> 51:51.887
Mm.
You know what?

51:51.970 --> 51:54.303
That fucker made me believe
he was laying down--

51:54.387 --> 51:56.053
no, of course not.

51:56.136 --> 51:58.261
The ol' sneak attack
from behind.

51:58.345 --> 52:01.512
Is there anything I can say to
get you to see it differently?

52:01.595 --> 52:03.303
There is not.

52:11.220 --> 52:13.178
Wags.

52:13.261 --> 52:15.762
You ready to become a wartime
consiglieri once again?

52:15.845 --> 52:18.428
Pop had Genco.
You have me.

52:18.512 --> 52:20.428
You know why they called it
going to the mattresses

52:20.512 --> 52:22.136
when mob families
went to war?

52:22.220 --> 52:23.929
It's mentioned in 1
but never explained.

52:24.011 --> 52:25.220
General idea.

52:25.303 --> 52:27.095
It's because you had to
move out of your home

52:27.178 --> 52:30.595
and hole up someplace where
no one could find you,

52:30.679 --> 52:32.053
with all your men.

52:32.136 --> 52:33.637
But you had to do it quick,

52:33.720 --> 52:35.679
so that you'd get the jump
on the rival family

52:35.762 --> 52:37.136
before they got
the jump on you.

52:37.220 --> 52:39.053
So you had places
stashed around the city,

52:39.136 --> 52:41.011
with the mattresses
on the floor.

52:41.095 --> 52:43.470
And that is where
you would make your stand

52:43.553 --> 52:46.428
until you nailed the boss
of the rival family.

52:46.512 --> 52:48.261
And once you got him

52:48.345 --> 52:50.428
and all his soldiers
fell into line,

52:50.512 --> 52:52.470
that's when you'd go home
to your comfy bed

52:52.553 --> 52:54.220
and your wife and kids.

52:54.303 --> 52:55.595
And that's what
we're about to do?

52:55.679 --> 52:57.095
We sure are.

52:57.178 --> 52:58.261
Get me Bach.

52:58.345 --> 52:59.595
Get me Hall.

52:59.679 --> 53:01.595
Get me anyone
who can help us find out

53:01.679 --> 53:05.512
what is near and dear to
Michael Thomas Aquinas Prince.

53:05.595 --> 53:08.095
Because when I find out
what matters to him,

53:08.178 --> 53:10.637
I am going to
fucking destroy it.

with it.
