00:02.544 --> 00:03.961
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.045 --> 00:06.089
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.637
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
COMING TO A FOOTBALL GAME

00:12.721 --> 00:14.305
WOULD BE GREAT
FOR MAN-WATCHING.

00:14.389 --> 00:17.267
- IT IS.
THERE ARE TWO OVER THERE.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.980
- OH, I'M SORRY,
I SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIED.

00:22.063 --> 00:25.150
MEN NOT WEARING DOG MASKS.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.609
- THIS LINE IS CRAZY.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.154
I WISH I COULD BE ONE OF THOSE
BALLSY, BRASH WOMEN

00:29.237 --> 00:30.447
THAT JUST SAYS, "SCREW IT,"

00:30.530 --> 00:31.990
AND WALKS RIGHT
INTO THE MEN'S ROOM.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.992
- THOSE WOMEN
ARE USUALLY DRUNK.

00:38.246 --> 00:41.458
SCREW IT,
I'M GOIN' IN.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.960
THERE ARE STALLS
IN THERE, RIGHT?

00:44.043 --> 00:46.212
- WELL, I'M SURE
I DON'T KNOW.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.381
- WELL, I DON'T CARE.

00:50.216 --> 00:55.472
- YOU TWO LOOK RIDICULOUS.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.640
- WHAT ARE YOU IN DOG YEARS,
LIKE 1,000?

00:57.724 --> 00:58.975
[laughter]

00:59.058 --> 01:01.144
- AND WHAT'S
MANCHESTER UNITED?

01:01.227 --> 01:03.104
- IT'S A FOOTBALL TEAM.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.524
REAL FOOTBALL, WHERE THE MEN
USE THEIR FEET, NOT THEIR HANDS.

01:06.608 --> 01:11.654
- I HAVE NO USE FOR MEN
WHO DON'T USE THEIR HANDS.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.282
- MELANIE, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.993
- WORSE. NO STALLS,
TROUGHS FOR URINALS,

01:17.076 --> 01:20.288
LIKE SOME SORT OF
HELLISH PIG FARM.

01:20.371 --> 01:23.500
DRUNKEN MEN,
BARELY AIMING.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.627
THAT'S IT.
NO MORE MAN-WATCHING.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.045
I'M DONE WITH MEN.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.838
- YOU KNOW,
THAT'S FUNNY,

01:28.922 --> 01:30.840
BUT THOSE ARE THE EXACT WORDS
YOU USED THE NIGHT THAT WE MET.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.176
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WE ALL SAID IT, DIDN'T WE?

01:33.259 --> 01:35.386
- NOW, HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET,
ANYWAY?

01:35.470 --> 01:38.181
- WOW, ELKA, YOU NEVER
ASK QUESTIONS LIKE THAT.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.683
- IF THERE WERE A TV IN VIEW,
I WOULDN'T,

01:40.767 --> 01:43.186
BUT THERE ISN'T, SO--

01:43.269 --> 01:45.522
- WELL, IT WAS BACK
IN THE '80s.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.817
I WAS ON THE ROOFTOP OF A HOTEL
IN BEVERLY HILLS, CRYING.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.360
WHICH IS REALLY A SHAME,

01:50.443 --> 01:52.570
BECAUSE I WAS HAVING
A VERY GOOD HAIR DAY.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.907
[sobbing]

01:59.244 --> 02:03.206
- [sobbing]

02:03.289 --> 02:05.291
I DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.544
I'M VICTORIA CHASE,
DAMN IT!

02:07.627 --> 02:10.713
I'M VICTORIA CHASE.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.840
- EXCUSE ME?

02:11.923 --> 02:13.883
HELLO?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.219
VICTORIA CHASE?

02:16.302 --> 02:20.223
- YOU RECOGNIZE ME?

02:28.481 --> 02:31.734
- I WAS NEVER
THAT INTO MADONNA,

02:31.818 --> 02:33.069
UNTIL, YOU KNOW--

02:36.197 --> 02:38.116
- YEAH, I LOOKED ADORABLE
IN THAT OUTFIT.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.618
- [laughing]
YEAH, RIGHT.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.579
- I WAS A LITTLE YOUNGER.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.747
- WELL,
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU THEN.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.417
I CAN ONLY PICTURE
HOW YOU'D LOOK IN IT TODAY.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.586
IT'S HILARIOUS.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.588
- WE CAN STILL PASS
FOR WOMEN IN OUR 20s,

02:51.671 --> 02:53.756
ESPECIALLY
SINCE WE MOVED TO CLEVELAND.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.760
- YOU MOVED,
YOU DIDN'T GO BACK IN TIME.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.221
- OH, WELL,
YOU PROBABLY WANT AN AUTOGRAPH.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.764
UH, WHO SHALL I
MAKE IT OUT TO?

03:01.848 --> 03:04.225
- I'M MELANIE, BUT I'M SORRY,
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

03:04.309 --> 03:07.979
- DO YOU EVER FEEL
NOT-SO-FRESH?

03:08.062 --> 03:09.230
- EXCUSE ME?

03:09.314 --> 03:11.900
- DON'T HATE ME
BECAUSE I'M BEAUTIFUL.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.693
- I DON'T HATE YOU.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.946
- NO, NO, NO. THOSE ARE LINES
FROM COMMERCIALS I DID.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.949
[Irish accent] MANLY, YES,
BUT I LIKE IT, TOO.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.119
- I'M SORRY,
I DON'T WATCH MUCH TV.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.288
- WELL, HAVE YOU HEARD
OF THE MOVIE,<i> E.T.?</i>

03:25.371 --> 03:27.206
- YEAH! WHO HASN'T?

03:27.290 --> 03:28.583
WERE YOU IN IT?

03:28.666 --> 03:31.127
- WELL, I WAS UP
FOR THE PART OF THE MOM.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.921
I EVEN SLEPT
WITH THE PRODUCER.

03:33.004 --> 03:36.841
USED TO MEAN SOMETHING
IN THIS TOWN.

03:36.925 --> 03:41.095
I HAVEN'T HAD A REAL ACTING GIG
IN OVER A YEAR.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.931
AND I'M STARTING TO WONDER

03:43.014 --> 03:44.349
IF IT'S EVER
GOING TO HAPPEN FOR ME.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.185
- OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

03:47.268 --> 03:50.647
I MEAN,
YOU SEEM REALLY THEATRICAL.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.315
YOU'RE VERY IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR EMOTIONS.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.107
- OH, THANK YOU.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.361
I WAS TRAINED TO CRY
AT JULLIARD.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.322
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
INSTEAD OF CRYING,

03:59.405 --> 04:01.157
LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHY WE'RE CRYING.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.909
- WELL,
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.452
AND I'M
A VERY GOOD LISTENER.

04:04.535 --> 04:05.995
YOU KNOW, MOST ACTRESSES
DON'T LISTEN,

04:06.079 --> 04:07.538
THEY'RE JUST
WAITING FOR THEIR NEXT LINE.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.874
- OH, WELL, I CAME HERE...
- UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.834
- TO SPY ON MY BOYFRIEND.
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.836
- BECAUSE I THOUGHT...
- OH, YEAH. MM-HMM.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.297
- THAT HE WAS CHEATING.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.839
YOU WANT TO GO FIRST,
DON'T YOU?

04:17.923 --> 04:19.341
- OH, IF YOU INSIST.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.010
UM, I CAME TO THIS HOTEL

04:21.094 --> 04:23.846
TO SEDUCE THE DIRECTOR OF
THIS MUSIC VIDEO I APPEARED IN.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.848
- YOU'RE IN A MUSIC VIDEO?

04:25.932 --> 04:26.975
- YEAH, BUT, UH,

04:27.058 --> 04:30.144
IT WASN'T EXACTLY
A STAND-OUT PART.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.698
- CUT!

04:41.781 --> 04:43.533
GIRL NUMBER THREE--

04:43.616 --> 04:45.076
- I HAVE A NAME.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.870
- YEAH, I KNOW,
I JUST USED IT.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.374
WILL YOU STAY IN YOUR PLACE?
- SORRY. SORRY.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.710
- AND...
ACTION!

♪ ♪

05:06.431 --> 05:08.057
CUT!

05:08.141 --> 05:10.268
AGAIN, NUMBER THREE,
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE EMOTING?

05:10.351 --> 05:12.228
- YOU KNOW, ASKING SOMEONE
WITH MY TRAINING

05:12.311 --> 05:15.314
NOT TO BE EXPRESSIVE IS LIKE
ASKING A FLAME NOT TO BURN.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.609
I AM NOT A MANNEQUIN,
I AM AN ACTRESS.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.529
- RIGHT, THEN ACT LIKE YOU'RE
FIRED, AND GET OFF THE STAGE.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.197
- NO, BUT--
- OFF THE SET!

05:26.284 --> 05:29.203
- SO AFTER THE DIRECTOR
FIRED ME, I THOUGHT,

05:29.287 --> 05:31.122
"WELL, WHAT WOULD MADONNA DO?"

05:31.205 --> 05:33.374
AND SO
I GOT DOWN ON MY KNEES.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.544
- AND PRAYED?

05:36.627 --> 05:38.588
- YOU'RE A LITTLE NAIVE,
AREN'T YOU?

05:38.671 --> 05:40.923
NO, IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE DIRECTOR WAS ALREADY

05:41.007 --> 05:43.968
SLEEPING WITH THE REAL MADONNA,
SO IT DIDN'T WORK.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.803
- YOU'RE WAY PRETTIER
THAN MADONNA.

05:45.887 --> 05:46.846
- AWW.

05:46.929 --> 05:50.308
NAIVE, BUT INSIGHTFUL.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.769
SO WHY WERE YOU CRYING?

05:52.852 --> 05:56.397
- OH, WELL, I THOUGHT
MY BOYFRIEND WAS CHEATING ON ME.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.107
SO I COULDN'T AFFORD
A DETECTIVE,

05:58.191 --> 05:59.400
SO I THOUGHT I'D DO
MY OWN SNOOPING,

05:59.484 --> 06:00.735
YOU KNOW,
JUST LIKE IN <i> MOONLIGHTING?</i>

06:00.818 --> 06:03.321
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T WATCH TV.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.615
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.866
MM-HMM.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.243
ANYWAY, I, UM--

06:09.327 --> 06:11.204
I FOLLOWED HIM UP
TO THE EIGHTH FLOOR,

06:27.887 --> 06:30.640
- UM, CAN I HELP YOU?

06:30.723 --> 06:33.810
- I--I WAS JUST TRYING TO SEE
WHO WAS IN THERE.

06:33.893 --> 06:37.980
- THE PEEPHOLE'S
FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.941
- YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

06:40.024 --> 06:44.821
WOW, STRAWBERRIES,
WHIPPED CREAM, CHAMPAGNE.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.365
GUESS WE KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOIN' IN THERE.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.325
- IT IS
THE HONEYMOON SUITE.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.493
- MMM.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.495
WAIT, HIS NAME
SHOULD BE ON THE BILL.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.830
- I CAN'T LET YOU SEE THAT.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.666
- OH, PLEASE?
I--

06:56.749 --> 06:58.709
I THINK MY BOYFRIEND'S IN THERE
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.294
- HEY.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.843
- I'M SORRY.
I'M A STRESS EATER.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.970
IT'S A REAL THING,
I SAW IT ON <i> OPRAH.</i>

07:09.053 --> 07:10.346
- ON WHAT?
-<i> OPRAH.</i>

07:10.429 --> 07:12.181
IT'S A NEW TV SHOW.
SHE'S VERY OPINIONATED.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.184
I DON'T THINK
IT'LL GO VERY LONG.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.228
- ROOM SERVICE!

07:17.311 --> 07:19.522
- COMING.
- OH, NO, MM, THAT'S HIM!

OH, I HAVEN'T REALLY
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH, HAVE I?

- OH!
- HEY.

- MELANIE,
I KNOW THAT IT'S YOU.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.415
- NO, YOU DON'T.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.507
- A-HA!
NOT IN THERE.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.925
WHERE IS SHE, JAKE?

07:48.009 --> 07:49.719
- THERE'S NO ONE HERE,
HONEY.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.053
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.847
- I COULDN'T WORK AT HOME.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.682
THEY'RE DOING CONSTRUCTION
NEXT DOOR.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.601

HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE CHAMPAGNE
AND TWO GLASSES?

07:59.478 --> 08:01.898
- THE HONEYMOON SUITE
WAS THE ONLY ROOM AVAILABLE,

08:01.981 --> 08:04.400
AND THIS STUFF
COMES WITH THE ROOM.

08:04.483 --> 08:07.945
- A LIKELY STORY.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.699
WAIT, THAT--
THAT DOES MAKE SENSE.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.076
I'M SO SORRY.
- IT'S OKAY.

LOOK, GO HOME,
LET ME GET BACK TO WORK,

08:16.954 --> 08:19.081
AND I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.083
- OR...

08:21.167 --> 08:23.961
YOU COULD LET ME
MAKE IT UP TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.922
AFTER ALL,
WE ARE IN A HOTEL ROOM.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.465

HONEY...

08:27.548 --> 08:29.091
I REALLY NEED TO WORK.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.553
- WHO WANTS TO WORK,
WHEN YOU CAN PLAY?

08:32.636 --> 08:36.933
THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY SEXY
WHEN I GET DOWN TO BUTTON 40.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.852
- BABE, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I'M ON A DEADLINE.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.104
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

WOULD LET YOU WORK.

NO JEALOUSY.

08:45.524 --> 08:46.442
SO I'M GONNA GO, OKAY?

08:46.525 --> 08:48.611
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW

08:48.694 --> 08:50.446
THAT THE WOMAN WALKIN' OUT
THAT DOOR,

08:50.529 --> 08:53.032
SHE TRUSTS YOU 100%.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.580
WHY IS THIS SO SMALL?

08:59.664 --> 09:00.623
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I WASN'T WEARING A SWEATER

09:00.706 --> 09:02.458
WHEN I CAME IN HERE.

09:02.541 --> 09:03.543
YOU ARE CHEATING ON ME.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.877
WHERE IS SHE?

09:04.961 --> 09:06.629
- IT'S PROBABLY
FROM THE LAST GUEST.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.631
- THE PERFUME IS STILL FRESH!
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS!

09:08.714 --> 09:09.799
- YOU ALREADY LOOKED.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.301
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TINY SHE WAS.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.930
A-HA!

09:16.013 --> 09:17.431
NOT THAT TINY.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.267
- MELANIE,
YOU ARE ACTING CRAZY.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.685
YOU LOOKED EVERYWHERE,
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.937
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME!

09:23.020 --> 09:24.563
- [sighs]
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:24.647 --> 09:29.986
I AM A PARANOID, INSECURE,
JEALOUS IDIOT...

09:30.069 --> 09:32.238
WHO IS SMELLING
THAT PERFUME AGAIN.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.490
- [laughs]

09:34.573 --> 09:36.951
YOU MUST BE MELANIE.

I THINK I GOT IT.

BUT WHY, JAKE?

09:51.090 --> 09:53.968
WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT ME?
WHAT WERE HIS COMPLAINTS?

09:54.051 --> 09:55.428
- HE SAYS
YOU TALK TOO MUCH.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.679
- I DO NOT TALK TOO MUCH.

A PERSON WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE--

OH, IT'S VERY HARD TO DEFEND
YOURSELF ABOUT TALKING TOO MUCH

10:03.060 --> 10:05.313
WITHOUT TALKING.

10:05.396 --> 10:09.233
- MELANIE,
YOU DON'T TALK TOO MUCH.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.526
LOOK, BABE.

10:10.609 --> 10:13.362
IT'S NOT YOU.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.657
IT'S ME.

10:16.741 --> 10:20.369
- WOW.
THAT'S DEEP.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.372
- YOU BOUGHT THAT B.S.?

10:23.456 --> 10:28.044
- IT WAS A NEW LINE THEN.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.546
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT THE HOTEL?

10:30.629 --> 10:32.882
WAITRESS?
MAID?

10:32.965 --> 10:35.384
HIGH-PRICED CALL GIRL?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.219
- I WAS AT
THE LOWEST POINT OF MY LIFE.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.429
- OH.

10:38.512 --> 10:42.058
LOW-PRICED CALL GIRL.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.685
- [weeping]

10:44.769 --> 10:45.728
- IS THAT
SOMEONE ELSE CRYING?

10:45.811 --> 10:48.898
- IT'S NOT A TRAINED CRY.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.567
- OH, MY GOD,
DON'T JUMP!

10:51.650 --> 10:52.568
- [screams]
- QUICK!

10:52.651 --> 10:54.695
JUMP ON THAT RUNAWAY TRAIN!

10:54.779 --> 10:57.740
MY GOD, EVEN IN CRISIS,
I'M WITTY.

10:57.823 --> 10:58.908
- QUICK.
WE CAN PULL HER UP.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.576
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:00.659 --> 11:02.370
- WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

11:02.453 --> 11:03.746
- WE THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA JUMP!

11:03.829 --> 11:07.541
- AND YOU
WANTED TO MAKE SURE?

11:11.128 --> 11:12.755
- I WASN'T
TRYING TO KILL MYSELF.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.423
I JUST DROPPED
MY HANDKERCHIEF.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.635
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DAB
MY TEARS OF JOY.

11:17.718 --> 11:21.305
INSTEAD I WAS USING IT
TO DAB THE TEARS <i> OF</i> JOY.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.100
MY NAME IS JOY.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.726
- OH.
- OH, YOU POOR THING.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.811
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.229
I'M MELANIE MORETTI.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.147
AND THIS IS VICTORIA CHASE.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.234
- DID YOU SEE <i> E.T.?</i>
- MAYBE NOT NOW.

11:33.317 --> 11:36.570
- I'M JOY SCROGGS.
ISN'T THAT A HIDEOUS NAME?

11:36.654 --> 11:38.739
I WAS ABOUT TO BE
JOY JONES.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.158
SO SNAPPY
AND ALLITERATIVE.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.995
I WAS THIS CLOSE
TO BEING SCROGGS-FREE.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.290
HI, I'M JOY JONES.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.959
THIS IS JOY JONES.

11:50.042 --> 11:50.960
[knocking at the door]

11:51.043 --> 11:52.878
[gasps]
COME IN!

11:52.962 --> 11:54.422
UNLESS YOU'RE THE GROOM.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.298
- BELLMAN, MA'AM.
DELIVERY FOR YOU.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.134
- JUST A MOMENT.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.135
- [on TV] I'M FINE,
THANK YOU.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.970
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU CAME RIGHT OFF THE CANVASS.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.471
- YOU COULD--
- WELL, I CAME RIGHT OFF THE--

12:02.555 --> 12:05.307
OUT OF THE ZOO.
- OUT OF THE ZOO.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.351
- THESE ARE MY LITTLE--
THEY'RE APES, THEY'RE GORILLAS,

12:07.435 --> 12:08.936
THEY'RE NOT MONKEYS.
- OH, IS--OH.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.146
- YES.
- SORRY.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.730
- WHAT AN ANNOYING WOMAN.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.361
[electrical shock]

12:18.404 --> 12:19.822
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.699
- I CAN'T MOVE!

12:21.782 --> 12:26.120
OH, MY GOD!
I'M PARALYZED ON MY WEDDING DAY!

12:26.203 --> 12:27.413
- YOU WANT ME
TO GET A DOCTOR?

12:27.496 --> 12:31.333
- NO, I'M SURE
IT'S JUST TEMPORARY.

12:31.417 --> 12:36.297
JUST A HIDEOUS FREAK ACCIDENT
ON THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.631
WHAT ARE YOU DELIVERING?

12:37.715 --> 12:41.260
- IT'S A NOTE FROM
A "KICK BONES."

12:41.343 --> 12:46.348
- KYLE JONES,
HE HAS TERRIBLE HANDWRITING.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.392
BUT OTHERWISE,
HE'S PERFECT.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.562
HE'S MY FIANCE.
WOULD YOU MIND READING IT TO ME?

12:51.645 --> 12:53.022
- I'LL TRY.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.815
UH, "DEAR JAY--"

12:54.899 --> 12:56.150
- JOY.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.526
- ARE YOU SURE?
IT LOOKS LIKE "JAY."

12:57.610 --> 13:01.071
- I THINK
I KNOW MY OWN NAME.

13:01.155 --> 13:06.243
- "YOU'RE SUCH A...
SWEAT PERSON."

13:06.327 --> 13:09.205
MAYBE IT'S "SWIT."
"SWIT PERSON."

13:09.288 --> 13:12.249
- IT'S "SWEET,"
YOU IDIOT.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.418
OBVIOUSLY,
HE THINKS I'M SWEET.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.546
- IT'S NOT
THAT OBVIOUS FROM HERE.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.007
- NO EDITORIALIZING.
WHAT'S NEXT?

13:20.090 --> 13:21.842
- "BUT..."

13:21.926 --> 13:23.844
- ARE YOU SURE
THE WORD IS "BUT"?

13:23.928 --> 13:26.847
- Y--YES, HE WROTE THAT
REAL CLEAR.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.390
- ALL RIGHT, GO ON.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.393
- "OUR RELATIONSHIP IS EVER."

13:31.477 --> 13:33.103
- EVER WHAT?

13:33.187 --> 13:35.272
EVERLASTING?
EVER-FRESH?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.900
- THERE'S NO WORD
AFTER "EVER."

13:37.983 --> 13:39.944
OH, I SEE,
IT'S NOT "EVER," IT'S "OVER."

13:40.027 --> 13:44.365
"OUR RELATIONSHIP IS OVER."
OH, THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

13:44.448 --> 13:45.616
- OH, MY GOD.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.909
- THERE'S MORE.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.410
- NO,
I CAN GUESS THE REST.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.037
JUST GO!

13:50.120 --> 13:53.749
- USUALLY I GET A TIP.

13:53.832 --> 13:57.002
- HERE'S YOUR TIP.
NEVER FALL IN LOVE.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.921
- WELL, I ALREADY DID,
AND WE HAVE A BABY ON THE WAY,

13:59.004 --> 14:01.757
SO EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.051
- OKAY, HOLD ON.

14:04.134 --> 14:07.721
I'LL JUST GET MY PURSE.

14:07.805 --> 14:08.973
OOF.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.308
OW. OW. OW. OW.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.309
OW.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.310
- [on TV]
WELL, HOW ARE YOU?

14:13.394 --> 14:14.603
- WELL,
I'M PRETTY GOOD,

14:14.687 --> 14:16.438
ACCORDING TO
WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.481
- YOU SURE LOOK--
[laughter]

14:21.235 --> 14:25.072
- STOP STARING AT ME,
YOU'RE CREEPING ME OUT.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.074
- WERE YOU ON TV
IN THE '80s?

14:27.157 --> 14:29.952
- YEAH, I SHOT J.R.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.164
- MY HEART IS TRULY BROKEN.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.833
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS DAY,

14:35.916 --> 14:38.210
LET ALONE
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.463
- WELL, YOU COULD ALWAYS
GO BACK TO AUSTRALIA.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.681
- I'M NOT FROM AUSTRALIA,
I'M FROM ENGLAND.

14:50.764 --> 14:54.143
- I TOOK ACCENTS PASS/FAIL
AT JULLIARD, AND...

14:54.226 --> 14:56.312
I PASSED.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.646
- HOW CAN YOU
STAND THIS WOMAN?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.982
- [laughs]
I JUST MET HER.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.984
- FLORIDA PANHANDLE.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.903
- NO, I'M FROM L.A.
- OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.824
- SO WHAT DID YOU DO
AFTER YOU HEARD THE NEWS?

15:08.907 --> 15:10.826
- I COULDN'T STAY
IN THE HONEYMOON SUITE,

15:10.909 --> 15:15.039
SO AFTER THE FEELING RETURNED
TO MY LIMBS I CHECKED OUT.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.624
ANOTHER COUPLE
TOOK THE ROOM.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.500
THIS CUTE GUY
AND THIS PERFECT, PETITE--

15:18.584 --> 15:20.878
- OH, NO,
THAT WAS HER BOYFRIEND.

15:20.961 --> 15:24.506
- HIDEOUS, STUNTED,
LITTLE FREAK.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.175
- THANK YOU.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.510
- I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO,
SO I RAN UP HERE.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.012
- WHAT ABOUT
THE WEDDING GUESTS?

15:30.095 --> 15:32.640
- [sighs]
THEY'RE ALL DOWN THERE WAITING.

15:32.723 --> 15:36.185
I CAN'T TELL THEM, IT'S JUST
TOO EMBARRASSING AND PAINFUL.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.478
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.858
- UH, EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME,
EVERYBODY.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.526
- COULD I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE?

15:44.610 --> 15:45.361
I'M MELANIE MORETTI.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.862
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

15:46.945 --> 15:48.572
WELL, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.865
IF YOU DON'T KNOW SOMEONE,
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW THEM.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.867
[laughs]

15:51.950 --> 15:55.579
WOW, I REALLY DO
TALK TOO MUCH.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.039
MY BOYFRIEND WAS RIGHT--
EX-BOYFRIEND.

15:57.122 --> 16:00.542
HE'S UPSTAIRS PORKING
SOME LITTLE POCKET VENUS.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.424
I'M SORRY, REVEREND.

16:07.508 --> 16:12.096
UM, I HAVE AN UNFORTUNATE
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.014
ALL MEN ARE BASTARDS.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.766
ESPECIALLY KYLE JONES.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.226
- PERHAPS I SHOULD
HANDLE THIS.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.436
UH, HELLO.
I'M VICTORIA CHASE.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.564
[laughs]

16:22.648 --> 16:25.192
I'M SURE THAT YOU RECOGNIZE ME
FROM MY MOVIES OF THE WEEK,

16:25.275 --> 16:28.946
COMMERCIALS,
THE OOH-LA-LA SASSOON AD.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.239
NO?

16:30.322 --> 16:32.908
REALLY? SERIOUSLY?
NOTHING?

16:32.991 --> 16:35.744
YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT WOULD, UH,
TURN MY CAREER AROUND,

16:35.828 --> 16:37.788
BUT IT DIDN'T.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.916
YOU SEE, MEN AREN'T THE PROBLEM,
IT'S LIFE.

16:40.999 --> 16:44.420
WE ALL HAVE DREAMS,
AND THOSE DREAMS GET CRUSHED,

16:44.503 --> 16:45.754
AND THEN YOU'RE--
[phone rings]

16:45.838 --> 16:49.425
OH, EXCUSE ME,
MY CELLULAR PHONE.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.265
- WOW, IT'S SO SMALL.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.474
- HELLO?

16:57.558 --> 17:01.145
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.480
MM-HMM.
[gasps] YOU'RE KIDDING.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.608
HONOR ST. RAVEN
ON <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW?</i>

17:06.692 --> 17:08.318
[laughing]
I GOT THE PART!

17:08.402 --> 17:09.569
OH!
MY GOD!

17:09.653 --> 17:10.612
OH, MY GOD, OKAY.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.448
OKAY,
FORGET EVERYTHING THAT I SAID.

17:12.531 --> 17:16.076
HOLLYWOOD IS A MAGICAL LAND
WHERE DREAMS DO COME TRUE.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.912
OH, THIS CALLS
FOR CHAMPAGNE.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.623
LET US CELEBRATE
THIS HAPPY DAY.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.541
- AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

17:23.625 --> 17:26.627
- OH, YEAH.
THE WEDDING'S OFF.

17:30.090 --> 17:34.261
- MY ONLY WORRY THIS MORNING
WAS WHO I WOULD TOSS THIS TO.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.637
SEEMS SO TRIVIAL NOW.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.432
- I SAY
YOU TOSS IT TO YOURSELF.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.601
I PREDICT THAT
YOU WILL MEET SOMEONE WONDERFUL,

17:40.684 --> 17:43.979
AND BE MARRIED
WITHIN THE YEAR.

17:44.062 --> 17:45.439
- I JUST KEEP LOOKING AT YOU
AND THINKING,

17:45.522 --> 17:48.817
"WHAT KIND OF IDIOT
WOULD WALK AWAY FROM THAT?"

17:48.901 --> 17:52.821
IF YOU'RE NOT MARRIED IN
20 YEARS, I'LL MARRY YOU MYSELF.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.828
- IF I'M NOT MARRIED
IN 20 YEARS,

17:59.912 --> 18:02.831
I WILL JUMP OFF THAT ROOF.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.917
THIS IS SO SWEET OF YOU.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.960
NONE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS
COULD FLY OVER FROM ENGLAND.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.716
FINE, AUSTRALIA.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.384
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
STAY AT MY PLACE TONIGHT.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.844
I KNOW I COULD USE
THE COMPANY.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.471
- OH, AND THEN TOMORROW
WE CAN GO TO THE BEACH,

18:17.554 --> 18:19.014
AND SLATHER OURSELVES
WITH BABY OIL,

18:19.097 --> 18:20.557
AND JUST LIE OUT
IN THE SUN ALL DAY.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.892
- YEAH.

18:21.975 --> 18:25.187
GET A NICE, HEALTHY TAN.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.523
- AND THEN TOMORROW NIGHT
WE CAN HIT THE SINGLES BARS.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.608
- NO.
I AM THROUGH WITH MEN.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.527
- I'M DONE WITH MEN TOO.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.196
- AH, WHO NEEDS 'EM?

18:34.279 --> 18:36.323
- WELL, WE'RE ALL GOOD LIARS,

18:36.406 --> 18:38.867
WHICH IS OFTEN
A GOOD BASIS FOR FRIENDSHIP.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.661
[laughter]

18:40.744 --> 18:43.831
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LAUGHING
TODAY, OF ALL DAYS.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.209
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WOULD'VE DONE WITHOUT YOU.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.045
- TO US.

18:50.128 --> 18:51.588
WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.382
- MAY IT BE
A LONG AND HAPPY UNION.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.174
[glasses clink]
- HERE, HERE.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.592
- [laughs]

18:57.594 --> 18:58.720
- MMM.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.265
FRENCH CHAMPAGNE.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.599
- HEY, WAS THIS GUY RICH?

19:02.683 --> 19:05.519
- VICTORIA,
HE WAS A TERRIBLE GUY,

19:05.602 --> 19:07.563
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW RICH HE IS.

19:07.646 --> 19:11.567
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE FROM L.A.?

19:11.650 --> 19:16.071
- YEAH, YOUR VALUES ARE
SUSPICIOUSLY MIDDLE-AMERICAN.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.282
- YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TELL ME THAT
ALL THE TIME.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.033
MAYBE I SHOULD MOVE THERE.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.743
- MOVE TO THE MIDWEST?

19:21.827 --> 19:25.747
[laughs]
GOOD GOD, I'D RATHER DIE.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.754
- NOW YOU'RE ALL
LIVING IN THE MIDWEST,

19:32.838 --> 19:36.425
MIDDLE-AGED, AND ALONE.
[laughs]

19:36.508 --> 19:39.094
IT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE IT'S TRUE.

19:39.177 --> 19:40.637
- WE'RE NOT ALONE,
WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.055
- [laughs]

19:42.139 --> 19:43.891
- SO THAT'S HOW WE MET.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.435
AND WE ALL REMEMBER
HOW WE MET YOU.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.729
- NOW, THERE'S JUST ONE THING
ABOUT THIS PLACE

19:48.812 --> 19:50.105
THAT I SHOULD MENTION.

19:50.188 --> 19:55.903
- WHY ARE YOU RENTING
TO PROSTITUTES?

19:55.986 --> 19:59.573
- THIS IS ELKA OSTROVSKY,
SHE'S A CARETAKER

19:59.656 --> 20:02.117
WHO COMES WITH THE HOUSE,
IF YOU WISH TO RETAIN HER.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.202
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO GET ALL THAT
WORKED OUT.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.750
LOOK, ELKA, THESE WOMEN DON'T
REALLY SEEM TO BE YOUR STYLE.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.921
- THEY'RE FROM L.A.,
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

20:14.004 --> 20:15.505
I WENT OUT THERE ONE TIME.

20:15.589 --> 20:19.635
I DID WELL
ON A FEW GAME SHOWS,

20:19.718 --> 20:22.971
BUT I WAS VERY GLAD
TO COME HOME.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.933
- I'LL TELL THEM THE PLACE
IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.685
- OH, NO, NO.
THEY CAN STAY.

20:28.769 --> 20:32.356
I'LL FIX 'EM.
