[The Barber of Seville overture]

01:07.786 --> 01:12.455
[music continues]

01:51.463 --> 01:54.063
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

01:59.504 --> 02:01.170
You okay?

02:01.272 --> 02:03.172
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

02:03.274 --> 02:04.674
Did you check up on the kids?

02:04.776 --> 02:06.309
No reception.

02:06.411 --> 02:08.945
Have you seen, Kim?

02:09.013 --> 02:11.280
Kim? No. Why?

02:11.382 --> 02:14.317
Scarlett's about to
start her speech.

02:14.419 --> 02:18.354
Oh.

02:18.456 --> 02:22.024
There she is.

02:22.127 --> 02:23.793
Jack: Gloria?

02:23.895 --> 02:25.661
Jack?

02:25.763 --> 02:26.762
-Nice to see you. -Nice
to see you, too.

02:26.865 --> 02:27.930
This is Jill, my wife.

02:28.032 --> 02:31.601
Nice to meet you. I'm Gloria.

02:31.703 --> 02:34.504
Jack and Jill, I'm sure you
take a lot of flak for that.

02:34.606 --> 02:35.838
For what?

02:35.940 --> 02:38.307
You know, Jack and Jill...

02:38.409 --> 02:40.343
ran up the hill?

02:40.445 --> 02:42.111
Oh...

02:42.213 --> 02:43.346
This is my husband, Phil.

02:43.448 --> 02:45.548
This is Jack, Lulu's vet.

02:45.650 --> 02:46.916
Hi.

02:47.018 --> 02:49.118
-Well... -Oh.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.791
Hello?

02:55.894 --> 02:57.460
Is this thing on?

02:57.562 --> 02:59.395
Good evening ladies
and gentlemen.

02:59.497 --> 03:03.232
I just wanted to say a few
words before you leave.

03:03.334 --> 03:06.536
First, I want to thank
all of you for coming,

03:06.638 --> 03:10.540
Mayor Grant and all of you
who are here to celebrate

03:10.642 --> 03:12.975
that Troy is no
longer in my life.

03:13.077 --> 03:15.878
Screw you Troy!

03:15.980 --> 03:17.580
Thanks to his philandering ways

03:17.715 --> 03:21.517
I now own this
wonderful mansion.

03:21.619 --> 03:25.688
And when you choose who to stay
friends with, just remember...

03:25.790 --> 03:30.159
I got all the money.

03:30.261 --> 03:34.497
And talking about
friends, this is serious,

03:34.599 --> 03:38.734
I'd like to propose a toast
to my three best friends

03:38.836 --> 03:40.036
since high school.

03:40.138 --> 03:43.706
The three-most incredible
women I've ever met.

03:43.808 --> 03:49.045
Monica, the smartest and
fiercest woman I know,

03:49.147 --> 03:51.380
who by the way, is also
my divorce attorney.

03:51.482 --> 03:58.421
Oh, and Kim, my beautiful
realtor friend.

03:58.523 --> 04:03.392
And last but not least, Gloria,

04:03.494 --> 04:07.363
who is not overwhelmed by the
pressures of a high-powered job

04:07.465 --> 04:10.233
or her appearance,
bless her heart...

04:10.335 --> 04:12.235
I'm sure she meant
it as a compliment.

04:12.337 --> 04:14.070
...because she has all the
time in the world to hear me

04:14.138 --> 04:17.106
carry on about my problems.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.574
Sorry.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.944
If it weren't for
these three women

04:22.046 --> 04:25.081
and our sacred Thursday
afternoon get-togethers,

04:25.183 --> 04:28.784
I can assure you, I
wouldn't be here today.

04:28.886 --> 04:31.053
That, and the
bipolar medication.

04:31.155 --> 04:33.756
Monica, Kim, and Gloria,

04:33.858 --> 04:38.094
please join me on stage so we
can raise our glasses together.

04:38.196 --> 04:40.229
[applause]

04:40.331 --> 04:41.831
Who?

04:52.510 --> 04:54.210
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

04:54.312 --> 04:56.679
Phil. Take one with the phone.

05:00.084 --> 05:02.818
[gunshot]

05:02.920 --> 05:03.753
[Troy] Where is she?

05:03.855 --> 05:06.922
Oh, my god. It's him.

05:07.025 --> 05:09.125
Where is she?

05:09.227 --> 05:11.127
It wasn't enough
for you, was it?

05:11.229 --> 05:18.301
It's never enough? You
always want more, and more?

05:18.403 --> 05:19.769
Troy.

05:19.871 --> 05:21.837
What are you doing? Don't move.

05:21.939 --> 05:23.539
You don't have to do this.

05:23.641 --> 05:28.044
Stay out of it? It's
none of your business?

05:28.146 --> 05:31.681
I understand what you're going
through, but it's not worth it.

05:31.783 --> 05:34.216
What the hell do you understand?

05:34.319 --> 05:38.054
Everything about her is fake.

05:38.156 --> 05:40.323
She was nothing when I met her.

05:40.425 --> 05:41.324
I gave her everything.

05:41.426 --> 05:44.527
The money, the
house, the implants,

05:44.629 --> 05:48.197
I made her what she is and
this is how she pays me back?

05:48.299 --> 05:52.802
You'll meet someone else,
you'll make more money.

05:56.841 --> 05:59.809
You don't understand.

05:59.911 --> 06:02.278
She won't stop until I'm dead.

06:06.484 --> 06:08.818
Just give me the gun.

06:08.920 --> 06:12.054
Troy. Just give me the gun.

06:12.123 --> 06:13.222
I love that bitch.

06:13.324 --> 06:17.159
Troy, just give me the gun.

06:17.261 --> 06:18.561
[screaming] No, Troy! God!

06:18.663 --> 06:20.062
[gunshot]

06:49.260 --> 06:52.928
[classical music]

06:57.702 --> 06:59.001
Nicky, Bradley. Time to go.

07:02.707 --> 07:04.273
Bradley.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.776
Can't you read stuff
for kids your age?

07:06.878 --> 07:08.277
I like it.

07:08.379 --> 07:09.145
I need to go.

07:09.247 --> 07:10.246
Please. Just three more pages.

07:10.348 --> 07:11.714
No. Grandma is outside.

07:11.816 --> 07:13.282
Nick?

07:16.754 --> 07:19.555
Call me before you go
to bed, you hear me?

07:19.657 --> 07:22.792
Wait. I love you.

07:22.894 --> 07:25.728
Bye. I love you.

07:25.830 --> 07:27.963
-Bye. -Bye.

07:28.065 --> 07:30.299
Bradley: Shotgun?
Nicky: I got it?

07:40.445 --> 07:43.679
Wait!

07:43.781 --> 07:46.615
Lulu! How many times
do I have to tell you

07:46.717 --> 07:49.018
to stay out of the trash.

07:59.263 --> 08:01.397
You left the trash
can open again.

08:01.499 --> 08:03.165
[Phil] <i> Sorry.</i>

08:09.941 --> 08:14.043
There'll be plenty to
drink at the party.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.945
Do we have to go?

08:16.047 --> 08:19.114
Seriously?

08:19.217 --> 08:21.984
I was just thinking that
maybe we can stay here

08:22.086 --> 08:24.787
and have our own party.

08:24.889 --> 08:29.358
Baby, you're wrinkling my suit.

08:29.427 --> 08:31.627
That's a nice tie. Is it new?

08:31.729 --> 08:34.129
Uh, yeah. It was a gift.

08:34.232 --> 08:35.698
From whom?

08:35.799 --> 08:38.567
Someone at the office.

08:44.107 --> 08:47.243
I miss you.

08:47.345 --> 08:48.978
I miss you too.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.881
But we can't do this right now.

08:51.983 --> 08:55.417
This is important to her.
You know that.

08:55.520 --> 08:58.420
What's so important about it?

08:58.523 --> 09:00.689
It's just another excuse for
Scarlett to show off her money.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.057
You shouldn't be jealous.

09:02.159 --> 09:04.527
You think I'm jealous
of Scarlett?

09:04.629 --> 09:06.562
Money doesn't mean
anything to me.

09:06.664 --> 09:08.430
That's because you've
always had it.

09:08.533 --> 09:10.499
Yes, my parents were rich.
So what?

09:10.601 --> 09:15.271
Trust me, it's better to be rich
and unhappy than poor and unhappy.

09:15.373 --> 09:19.408
Is this about my father's will again?
What is it that you need?

09:19.510 --> 09:21.577
You have a nice
house, a nice car,

09:21.679 --> 09:23.045
your kids go to a good school.

09:23.147 --> 09:25.748
That's not the
point, you know it.

09:25.850 --> 09:27.616
The point is it's our money,

09:27.718 --> 09:29.618
we should be able to do
whatever you want with it.

09:29.720 --> 09:34.657
It was his money and his right
to do whatever he wanted.

09:34.759 --> 09:37.493
Maybe you're the one who's
jealous of Scarlett.

09:40.898 --> 09:43.599
You know how I ended up in
Saint Francis with you.

09:43.701 --> 09:45.267
A scholarship, I know.

09:45.369 --> 09:50.205
My dad got sick working
in your dad's coal mines.

09:50.308 --> 09:52.575
So when he did nothing but sit
around and get drunk all day,

09:52.677 --> 09:55.477
my mom had to go to work at
Saint Francis as a janitor,

09:55.580 --> 09:58.113
just so I could get a
scholarship there.

09:58.215 --> 10:02.217
I used to watch kids piss all
over the walls and laugh at me,

10:02.320 --> 10:07.790
telling me my mother was going to wipe
that up so I could go to school with them.

10:07.925 --> 10:10.993
It's more than money, Gloria.

10:11.095 --> 10:13.462
It's dignity.

10:13.564 --> 10:15.064
Wait.

10:16.801 --> 10:18.567
I'm sorry.

10:25.076 --> 10:26.308
Yeah.

10:34.652 --> 10:36.885
Are you ready to go?

10:41.359 --> 10:43.659
I forgot the present
in the office.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.300
What wrong with you today?

12:09.469 --> 12:10.935
Why are you fighting with me?

12:11.038 --> 12:12.537
I'm not fighting with you

12:12.639 --> 12:14.906
I just asked you what you two
were talking about.

12:15.876 --> 12:18.543
How are you two doing?
Enjoying the party?

12:18.645 --> 12:20.045
Everything is perfect.

12:20.147 --> 12:22.347
Thanks. I'm glad.

12:22.449 --> 12:25.383
Do you mind if I steal Phil
for a couple of minutes?

12:25.485 --> 12:28.420
I have a couple of clients
I'd like to introduce him to.

12:28.522 --> 12:30.889
Okay? Thanks, honey.

12:35.395 --> 12:39.564
[classical music continues]

12:42.969 --> 12:45.670
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

12:45.772 --> 12:50.075
Come on, I'm a lawyer, I can
tell when you're lying.

12:50.177 --> 12:52.544
I think Phil wants to leave me.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.179
Oh. I'm sorry.

12:54.314 --> 12:56.881
I just don't understand
what I did wrong.

12:56.983 --> 12:59.217
I take care of the kids,
I cook, I clean.

12:59.319 --> 13:00.585
I've sacrificed my whole
life for him

13:00.687 --> 13:02.053
and I don't even
complain about it.

13:02.155 --> 13:03.788
Maybe it's not about you.

13:04.958 --> 13:05.924
Did he say something?

13:06.026 --> 13:07.258
To me?

13:08.962 --> 13:10.695
Is he seeing someone else?

13:10.797 --> 13:12.197
How should I know?

13:12.299 --> 13:13.932
I don't know.
You're his oldest friend.

13:14.034 --> 13:15.233
I thought he might have...

13:15.335 --> 13:17.769
If he's seeing someone
I have no idea. I promise.

13:17.871 --> 13:19.871
I think it's Scarlett.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.406
He's never gotten over her.

13:21.508 --> 13:24.375
That was a long time ago and he
chose you, didn't he?

13:24.478 --> 13:26.277
Yeah, after she dumped him.

13:26.379 --> 13:28.913
I don't think anything is
going on, Gloria. Really.

13:29.015 --> 13:31.082
Now she's divorced and
she has all this money,

13:31.184 --> 13:32.884
why wouldn't he choose her?

13:32.986 --> 13:34.686
Don't say that.

13:34.788 --> 13:38.289
He bought two tickets
to Buenos Aires.

13:38.391 --> 13:40.458
I found the receipt
on his computer today.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.926
Did you ask him about it?

13:42.028 --> 13:44.362
No.

13:44.464 --> 13:46.931
Then maybe he's planning
a surprise for you.

13:47.033 --> 13:48.566
Give him the benefit
of the doubt.

13:48.668 --> 13:50.735
What are you two
gossiping about?

13:50.837 --> 13:52.470
Nothing.

13:52.572 --> 13:55.406
Oh, you're talking
about me then.

13:55.509 --> 13:58.243
I'm about to cut the cake.
I prepared a speech.

13:58.345 --> 13:59.577
I'd like you to hear it.

13:59.679 --> 14:01.613
We'll be right there.

14:02.415 --> 14:03.882
Have you seen Kim?

14:03.984 --> 14:05.650
No.

14:07.154 --> 14:08.386
Meet me by the pool
in a couple of minutes?

14:08.488 --> 14:09.420
Um, hmm.

14:09.489 --> 14:10.989
Cool. Thanks, honey.

14:12.692 --> 14:13.925
Where are you going?

14:14.027 --> 14:17.295
You're not planning on talking
to her now, are you?

14:17.397 --> 14:19.464
I'm going to find Phil.

14:19.566 --> 14:21.499
I'm sure he won't want to miss
Scarlett's speech.

14:21.601 --> 14:24.135
Gloria.

14:24.237 --> 14:26.905
Wait, wait, wait, Phil...

14:27.007 --> 14:28.907
Take one with the phone.

14:32.245 --> 14:33.111
[gunshot]

14:33.213 --> 14:34.679
[screams]
Oh, my...!

14:45.192 --> 14:47.392
That party must have cost
at least a hundred grand.

14:49.129 --> 14:51.462
How many people do you think
there were tonight?

14:51.565 --> 14:52.931
I don't know.

14:56.536 --> 14:57.702
You okay?

15:01.641 --> 15:03.041
I'm fine.

15:04.411 --> 15:06.311
Do you want to talk about it?

15:06.413 --> 15:07.979
No.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.715
What made you run up
to him like that?

15:10.817 --> 15:12.617
I don't know.

15:12.719 --> 15:15.486
What did he say?

15:15.589 --> 15:17.388
He said he still loved her.

15:18.525 --> 15:20.225
So much for love.

15:34.007 --> 15:35.306
What's this?

15:35.408 --> 15:37.342
I prepared your favorite.

15:37.444 --> 15:39.644
Wow! I see.

15:39.746 --> 15:40.745
How did you sleep?

15:40.847 --> 15:42.180
I passed out.

15:42.282 --> 15:43.848
How about you?

15:43.950 --> 15:50.622
I was thinking we should go
to a marriage counselor.

15:50.724 --> 15:56.594
I made a list of a few that
I liked so you can choose.

16:02.502 --> 16:03.735
What for?

16:03.837 --> 16:07.705
I think it'll help us
communicate.

16:07.807 --> 16:09.841
We're communicate now,
aren't we?

16:09.943 --> 16:11.876
I'm worried Phil,

16:11.978 --> 16:14.245
I don't want us to end up
like Scarlett and Troy.

16:14.314 --> 16:17.982
You're not Scarlett and
I'm definitely not Troy,

16:18.084 --> 16:20.685
so there's nothing for you
to worry about.

16:27.260 --> 16:29.661
This is important to me.

16:32.866 --> 16:36.601
I'm late for a meeting
at the course.

16:36.703 --> 16:39.470
We can talk about it later.

16:41.107 --> 16:43.041
Thanks for breakfast.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.700
hey guys.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Did you have a great time at Grandma's

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Is it true there is a
shooter at the party.

16:58.024 --> 17:00.024
Where did you hear that?

17:00.048 --> 17:03.948
Nicky saw it on facebook.
Everyone is talking about it.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
they say he shot himself.
Is true.

17:08.599 --> 17:12.000
Cool, did you get to see
him blow his brain out?

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
no it's not cool
is actually very sad.

17:16.200 --> 17:20.000
Is actually Scarlett Ex.
what why do he do it.

17:20.200 --> 17:24.000
Cos he is a psycho
he's not.

17:24.200 --> 17:28.000
he wasn't a psycho he was just going
through a very difficult time.

17:28.023 --> 17:30.024
A situation and a breakdown

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
He should have shot Scarlett.
Nicky!

17:34.024 --> 17:36.024
What

17:41.245 --> 17:43.578
Server the Lord with gladness.

17:43.681 --> 17:45.580
Come before him and
joyfully sing.

17:45.683 --> 17:48.550
I will sing loving
kindness and justice.

17:48.652 --> 17:52.020
Oh, thee Lord, I
sing thee praises.

17:52.122 --> 18:02.097
I will give heed...

18:02.199 --> 18:10.872
I will give heed...

18:10.975 --> 18:13.875
[crying]

18:18.782 --> 18:22.150
Someone please tell Scarlet we
can all see her grief from here.

18:27.558 --> 18:29.257
[classical music]

18:46.643 --> 18:48.844
It's fabulous!

18:50.547 --> 18:54.883
No! I will tell my client, but
I can't make any promises.

18:55.252 --> 18:57.052
What are you doing?

18:57.154 --> 18:58.553
I'll call you back.

18:58.655 --> 19:00.322
We are here to have fun.

19:00.424 --> 19:02.557
That was Troy's lawyer.

19:02.659 --> 19:04.593
Are you sure you want to
go through with this?

19:04.695 --> 19:05.794
Why not?

19:05.896 --> 19:08.430
You have his house,
the business,

19:08.532 --> 19:11.900
if we go after the hidden
assets he'll go to jail.

19:12.002 --> 19:17.305
As someone once said, frankly,
I just don't give a damn.

19:17.408 --> 19:18.907
He started it, now
let's finish it.

19:19.009 --> 19:20.742
And I thought I was ruthless.

19:22.379 --> 19:24.179
Gloria, Phil!

19:24.882 --> 19:26.181
It's true.

19:26.283 --> 19:30.452
If divorce was easier, I would
have left him years ago.

19:30.554 --> 19:33.622
The only time Troy
ever gave me an orgasm

19:33.724 --> 19:35.857
was when he signed
the divorce papers.

19:35.959 --> 19:38.160
[all laughing]

19:38.262 --> 19:41.596
I'll be right back.

19:41.698 --> 19:43.665
Gloria: What were you
two talking about?

19:44.568 --> 19:45.767
How are you two doing?

19:51.575 --> 19:53.475
What the hell are you doing?

19:53.577 --> 19:55.577
I have a surprise for you.

20:46.697 --> 20:48.063
Stop.

20:48.165 --> 20:53.001
-What's wrong? -Stop!
I can't do this.

20:53.103 --> 20:54.202
Are you kidding me?

20:54.304 --> 20:56.371
What do you mean
you can't do this?

20:56.473 --> 20:58.440
You know what I mean.

20:58.542 --> 21:00.876
I didn't have a choice.

21:00.978 --> 21:03.879
I was going to lose everything.

21:03.981 --> 21:06.715
But it's over now.
We can be together.

21:06.817 --> 21:08.083
No.

21:08.185 --> 21:10.085
What do you mean, no?

21:10.187 --> 21:11.753
I'm not a teenager anymore.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.688
I'm not gonna play
these games with you.

21:13.790 --> 21:15.457
What are you talking about?

21:15.559 --> 21:17.526
You're sick, Scarlett.

21:17.628 --> 21:20.962
One minute you want to jump me and the
next you want to slit your wrists.

21:21.064 --> 21:23.999
I used to find it thrilling

21:24.067 --> 21:26.434
but now I realize
it's just pathetic.

21:26.537 --> 21:29.871
I'm serious, leave me
and my family alone.

21:32.442 --> 21:35.477
[door opens and closes]

22:15.519 --> 22:16.751
Give him the benefit
of the doubt.

22:16.853 --> 22:18.753
Maybe he's planning
a surprise for you.

22:18.855 --> 22:21.289
What are you two
gossiping about?

22:21.391 --> 22:22.991
Nothing.

22:23.093 --> 22:26.261
Oh, you're talking
about me then.

22:26.396 --> 22:28.430
I'm about to cut the cake.
I prepared a speech.

22:28.532 --> 22:29.798
I'd like you to hear it.

22:29.900 --> 22:31.266
We'll be right there.

22:33.537 --> 22:36.037
Scarlett. Scarlett?

22:36.139 --> 22:38.206
Hey, what's up?

22:38.308 --> 22:39.040
Can we talk?

22:39.142 --> 22:40.475
Can it wait till later?

22:40.577 --> 22:42.877
I know about you and Phil.

22:42.980 --> 22:44.946
What are you talking
about, honey?

22:45.048 --> 22:46.982
How could you do this?

22:47.084 --> 22:48.783
I'm your friend,

22:48.885 --> 22:52.120
I'm the only one who's stood by you
through all your ups and downs.

22:52.222 --> 22:54.556
And God knows there's
been a lot of them.

22:54.658 --> 22:57.525
I have no idea what
this is about.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.161
You can play dumb blonde
with anyone but me.

23:00.264 --> 23:04.366
I know you. There isn't a dumb
calorie in your whole body.

23:04.468 --> 23:07.035
I just want to know when you
started sleeping with him, again.

23:07.137 --> 23:09.304
Or if you just never stopped?

23:09.406 --> 23:10.739
I'm not sleeping with him!

23:10.807 --> 23:12.807
Come on, Scarlett! When
you want something,

23:12.909 --> 23:14.976
you stop at nothing to get it.
You know it's true.

23:15.078 --> 23:18.380
Gloria, stop. There's
nothing between us.

23:18.482 --> 23:22.017
Please, just stop denying it. At
least give me that much credit.

23:22.119 --> 23:25.186
He still wears the Baume Mercier
watch that you gave him.

23:25.289 --> 23:27.889
It's a nice watch.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.193
How can you do this?

23:32.296 --> 23:33.928
You can have any man you want.

23:34.031 --> 23:35.864
Why my husband?

23:35.966 --> 23:38.566
If you take him, you'll
destroy my entire life.

23:38.669 --> 23:40.368
If things aren't going
well between the you two,

23:40.470 --> 23:41.803
find someone else
to blame it on,

23:41.905 --> 23:44.606
because this time it's got
no thing to do with me.

23:48.979 --> 23:51.112
I haven't slept at
all since the party.

23:51.214 --> 23:53.181
Oh, sister, please.

23:53.984 --> 23:56.017
Oh, Gloria, Phil.

23:56.119 --> 23:57.519
Hey!

23:57.621 --> 23:59.621
Thank you so much for coming.

23:59.723 --> 24:03.224
You have no idea how hard
this has been on me.

24:03.327 --> 24:06.061
I tried calling you a few times
and you didn't answer my calls.

24:06.163 --> 24:09.631
I just wanted to make
sure you are okay.

24:09.733 --> 24:11.866
Are you coming on Thursday?

24:11.968 --> 24:14.436
I don't think so.

24:14.538 --> 24:16.004
I'll call you later.

24:23.213 --> 24:24.446
What's up with her?

24:24.548 --> 24:25.947
I don't know.

24:41.965 --> 24:45.300
[phone ringing]

24:47.904 --> 24:49.371
Hello?

24:49.473 --> 24:50.972
<i> Hi, is this Bradly's mom?</i>

24:51.074 --> 24:52.407
Yes.

24:52.509 --> 24:54.008
<i>I'm calling from the nurse's
office at Highland Woods.</i>

24:54.111 --> 24:56.611
<i>Bradly is fine but we
need you to pick him up.</i>

24:56.713 --> 24:58.546
Is he okay?

25:01.585 --> 25:04.319
Okay. What happened?

25:04.421 --> 25:05.420
I don't want to talk
about it, okay?

25:05.522 --> 25:06.755
Who hit you?

25:06.857 --> 25:08.256
It was nobody.

25:08.358 --> 25:10.425
If you don't tell me right now,

25:10.527 --> 25:12.060
I'm gonna start asking around.

25:12.162 --> 25:15.263
Okay, fine. It was Matt.

25:15.365 --> 25:19.234
What? I can't believe that! I'm
going to call his mom right now.

25:19.336 --> 25:23.772
No! Mom. Please, It's
over, we settled it.

25:23.874 --> 25:25.206
It was my fault.

25:27.144 --> 25:29.778
I hit him first.

25:29.880 --> 25:31.212
Why?

25:43.193 --> 25:44.559
Phil: Yes.

25:51.868 --> 25:53.301
I am working on it!

25:55.906 --> 25:59.207
No, I can't talk right now.

26:02.546 --> 26:03.878
No.

26:05.715 --> 26:07.982
Bradly: Can you guess it?
Nicky: What do you think?

26:10.921 --> 26:13.521
[indistinct dialogue]

26:25.602 --> 26:27.001
What's this?

26:27.103 --> 26:28.803
Pizza party.

26:28.905 --> 26:32.207
I didn't have time to go to the
market so I just ordered delivery.

26:32.309 --> 26:34.142
Want a slice?

26:34.244 --> 26:35.343
We have pepperoni.

26:37.881 --> 26:39.848
What happened to your nose?

26:39.950 --> 26:41.449
Matt beat him up at school.

26:41.551 --> 26:43.518
What?

26:43.620 --> 26:45.353
We talked about it.

26:45.455 --> 26:47.455
Have you talked to
Matt's parents?

26:48.825 --> 26:49.891
No.

26:49.993 --> 26:51.125
Why not?

26:52.295 --> 26:54.028
Because Bradly hit him first.

26:54.097 --> 26:55.563
And you reward him with pizza?

26:55.665 --> 26:57.465
Matt was teasing him.

26:57.567 --> 27:00.001
-I don't care! -Sorry.

27:00.103 --> 27:02.003
You're sorry?

27:02.105 --> 27:05.740
If I would have done something like that
my dad would have beat the crap out of me.

27:05.809 --> 27:08.076
Okay, you're over reacting.

27:08.178 --> 27:10.545
He let his emotions get the
best of him, that's all.

27:10.647 --> 27:11.880
That's all?

27:11.948 --> 27:13.815
That's the point, Gloria.

27:13.917 --> 27:16.251
Do you know how
this makes me look?

27:16.353 --> 27:17.752
Do you?

27:18.522 --> 27:19.888
-Go to your room.
-I'm not done yet.

27:19.990 --> 27:22.390
[screaming] I said,
go to your room, now!

27:27.664 --> 27:30.064
Phil. What are you doing?

27:31.301 --> 27:33.902
Do you understand that he was fighting
because he was trying to defend you?

27:34.004 --> 27:36.104
I don't care. I really don't.

27:36.206 --> 27:38.006
He has to learn to be a man.

27:38.108 --> 27:41.676
And he's never going to do that if
you keep treating him like a baby?

27:41.778 --> 27:44.846
He still pees the
bed, for God's sake.

27:44.948 --> 27:47.916
Phil, what are you doing?

27:48.018 --> 27:50.585
Why are you acting like this?

27:56.026 --> 27:57.625
Like what?

27:59.763 --> 28:01.296
I'm fine.

28:07.370 --> 28:09.637
It's a little cold, right?

28:10.941 --> 28:13.174
I mean, it's still good, you know.
I'll eat it.

30:03.318 --> 30:04.784
Hey there.

30:07.155 --> 30:08.588
What's wrong?

30:09.591 --> 30:11.424
You want something to eat?

30:29.310 --> 30:31.177
[doorbell]

30:39.020 --> 30:41.354
I do apologize for
stopping by unannounced

30:41.456 --> 30:43.790
but you are not answering
my phone calls.

30:46.027 --> 30:47.927
Where was this?

30:48.029 --> 30:50.396
The Rostropovich
competition in Paris.

30:50.498 --> 30:51.931
Are you still playing?

30:52.033 --> 30:54.634
No, I gave my Cello to Nicky.

30:54.736 --> 30:56.736
How's she doing?

30:56.838 --> 30:58.538
She's fine.

31:00.075 --> 31:03.142
Did I do something to upset you?

31:03.244 --> 31:05.578
Why do you ask?

31:05.680 --> 31:08.781
Ever since my party you've
been acting strange with me.

31:08.883 --> 31:12.351
Sorry. I just need some
time to figure things out.

31:12.454 --> 31:15.922
Is this about Phil again?

31:16.024 --> 31:17.523
Why don't you just
get rid of him?

31:17.625 --> 31:20.059
It's not that easy. I
have kids to think about.

31:20.161 --> 31:22.729
You have to take care
of yourself first.

31:24.899 --> 31:26.532
What happened to you?

31:26.634 --> 31:29.302
You used to be so
confident, so cool.

31:29.404 --> 31:32.772
Monica, Kim, and I, we
always wanted to be you,

31:32.874 --> 31:36.042
and now it's like you've
given up on yourself, babe.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.944
What am I supposed to do?

31:38.046 --> 31:40.146
Just throw it all away?

31:40.248 --> 31:42.014
People make mistakes.

31:42.117 --> 31:45.218
Relationships have
their ups and downs.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.454
Phil and I have been going through
a rough patch since my dad died,

31:48.556 --> 31:52.725
but I know we can
just get through it.

31:52.827 --> 31:55.895
That's another thing I've
always admired that about you.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.396
What?

31:57.499 --> 31:59.799
How idiotically hopeful you are.

32:01.636 --> 32:05.371
I rather be hopeful,
than cynical.

32:08.343 --> 32:12.378
Now, I have things to do. So,
if you need anything else?

32:12.480 --> 32:14.647
Tomorrow is Thursday.

32:14.749 --> 32:16.048
I need space.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.050
Who's going to bring the wine?

32:18.153 --> 32:19.986
I'll give you a bottle
if you need it.

32:20.088 --> 32:21.687
No, it's okay.

32:21.790 --> 32:24.157
Holler at me if you
change your mind.

32:24.259 --> 32:26.726
Okay, we're meeting
at five, as usual.

32:26.828 --> 32:28.761
-Bye. -Bye.

32:34.002 --> 32:36.002
This stuff's horrible.

32:36.104 --> 32:41.107
The guy at the store said it
was the most expensive bottle.

32:41.209 --> 32:45.444
Gloria, is the only one of y'all who
can pick out a decent bottle of red.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.413
I'm worried about her.

32:47.482 --> 32:50.283
Ever since the party she's
been acting strange.

32:50.385 --> 32:54.587
Well, she did tell me at the party she
discovered something on Phil's computer.

32:54.689 --> 32:57.690
You should put your
investigator on Phil.

32:57.792 --> 32:59.725
If he's up to something we
should help her catch him.

32:59.828 --> 33:02.762
If you hire an investigator,
I'll tell him.

33:02.864 --> 33:05.498
You wouldn't bust a
grape at a fruit fight.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.901
I don't have to listen to this.
I'm leaving.

33:09.003 --> 33:10.803
No, I'm sorry. Relax.

33:10.905 --> 33:13.039
Sit down. I'm not
gonna do anything.

33:13.141 --> 33:14.941
For now.

33:15.043 --> 33:18.477
Well, I'm going to fetch something to
wash this awful taste out of my mouth.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.812
Do you gals want anything?

33:19.914 --> 33:21.047
-Um hmm. -I can go.

33:21.149 --> 33:25.151
No it's fine. I'll get it.

33:30.792 --> 33:34.460
[classical music]

33:53.615 --> 33:54.881
Hey, neighbor.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.618
How much do you think
this circus cost?

33:58.720 --> 34:00.353
I don't know about
the grand total,

34:00.455 --> 34:04.357
but this beluga fish caviar
is ten grand a pound.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.627
It's so disgusting but
you have to try it.

34:07.729 --> 34:09.594
How far we've come, you and I.

34:11.733 --> 34:16.369
Did you look into that
thing I sent you?

34:16.471 --> 34:17.703
I can't do it.

34:17.804 --> 34:19.672
Come on.

34:19.774 --> 34:21.274
I'm just asking you
to help me out.

34:21.376 --> 34:23.876
No, you're asking me for
much more than that.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.678
You're asking me to
betray my friend.

34:25.780 --> 34:28.080
And I'm giving you half a
million reasons to do it.

34:28.181 --> 34:29.614
It's not about money.

34:33.588 --> 34:35.655
It's always about money.

34:35.757 --> 34:37.822
I saw it in your face,

34:37.958 --> 34:40.626
every morning when we had to
take the bus to Saint Francis,

34:40.728 --> 34:43.029
past their big gorgeous houses.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.065
You know what they
used to call us?

34:47.402 --> 34:50.101
-The Charity kids.
-The Charity kids.

34:51.105 --> 34:53.505
How much longer do
they get to remind us

34:53.608 --> 34:56.442
that without them,
we'd be worthless?

34:59.647 --> 35:01.147
I looked into it.

35:02.817 --> 35:07.186
The money can only be used for
your children after they turn 18.

35:07.288 --> 35:10.089
Yes, I know that, that's why I
need you to help me change it.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.557
There has to be a way.

35:11.659 --> 35:15.094
There are always ways, but they
would have to involve her.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.596
What do you mean involve her?
How?

35:17.699 --> 35:21.567
The money can be invested in
what's called an "orphan" company,

35:21.669 --> 35:24.337
and then through some maneuvering
we can get around it.

35:24.439 --> 35:26.105
But Gloria is the sole manager.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.873
If she's not on board,
you can't touch it.

35:27.976 --> 35:29.342
The whole point was
to keep her out.

35:29.444 --> 35:31.444
I know.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.079
I'm sorry.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.451
What if we falsify
her signature?

35:38.553 --> 35:41.153
How long do you think it would
take her to figure it out

35:41.222 --> 35:43.589
and for both of us
to end up in jail?

35:43.691 --> 35:46.359
There are better
ways to handle this.

35:50.431 --> 35:51.430
Like what?

35:58.172 --> 35:59.939
[cell ringing]

36:05.346 --> 36:06.312
Hey neighbor,

36:06.414 --> 36:07.313
<i> how's it going?</i>

36:07.415 --> 36:09.081
Good. Look, I can't
talk right now

36:09.183 --> 36:10.583
but I just wanted to
give you a heads up.

36:10.685 --> 36:12.118
Scarlett was at your
house yesterday

36:12.186 --> 36:13.886
chit chatting with Gloria.

36:13.988 --> 36:16.222
She knows that you're after her money
so you have to be extra careful.

36:16.858 --> 36:19.458
Don't worry. I have
it under control.

36:19.560 --> 36:22.528
Good. We'll talk later. Bye.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.967
So, I put some
candies in your bags

36:28.069 --> 36:29.435
but they're for you to
share with everyone, okay?

36:29.537 --> 36:31.337
Okay.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.306
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

36:35.043 --> 36:36.509
Mom, you're embarrassing us.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.110
Sorry, sorry.

36:38.212 --> 36:42.681
Make sure you put on a lot of
sunscreen and bug spray, okay?

36:42.784 --> 36:45.818
-Okay. -And Bradly,
no hitting, okay?

36:45.920 --> 36:48.120
If someone teases you, you
go to a counselor, okay?

36:48.222 --> 36:49.789
-No fighting. -Got it.

36:49.857 --> 36:51.524
Do you think you can
come home early today?

36:51.626 --> 36:53.626
<i> Why?</i>

36:53.728 --> 36:56.796
I was just thinking, since we're alone,
it'd be nice for us to hang out together.

36:56.898 --> 36:58.597
Yeah, I can probably do that.

36:58.699 --> 37:01.000
I have a lot of stuff I
have to do first though.

37:01.102 --> 37:02.601
Okay, I love you.

37:02.703 --> 37:04.370
I love you, too.

37:20.054 --> 37:22.621
Honey! What are you...

37:23.925 --> 37:25.591
Are you okay?

37:27.662 --> 37:28.894
Jack: <i> Gloria, what's going on?</i>

37:28.996 --> 37:31.230
Jack, it's Lulu. I don't
know what's wrong with her.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.631
I found her by the trash.

37:32.733 --> 37:34.467
She's not moving, and her
tongue is sticking out.

37:34.569 --> 37:35.367
Is she breathing?

37:35.470 --> 37:36.669
<i> Barely. She's panting.</i>

37:36.771 --> 37:38.037
Did you see if she ate anything?

37:38.139 --> 37:39.371
<i> Anything that could
have made her sick?</i>

37:39.474 --> 37:40.940
I don't know. I'm
on my way there.

37:41.042 --> 37:42.108
Okay, bring her.

37:55.123 --> 37:56.122
[crash]

38:00.593 --> 38:02.259
Just do it.

38:03.062 --> 38:04.761
I'll call you back.

38:07.433 --> 38:08.999
What happened?

38:11.036 --> 38:12.603
How long was I out?

38:12.705 --> 38:14.271
Since yesterday.

38:14.373 --> 38:18.942
They had to operate on your leg.

38:20.479 --> 38:22.479
What about Lulu?

38:22.581 --> 38:24.982
Lulu's dead.

38:25.084 --> 38:26.817
I'm going to have her cremated.

38:26.919 --> 38:28.152
Do the kids know?

38:28.254 --> 38:31.455
No, I haven't told
them anything yet.

38:31.557 --> 38:32.823
I don't want to ruin
their vacation.

38:32.925 --> 38:34.992
I'd like to wait
till they get back.

38:35.094 --> 38:36.727
Good idea.

38:37.329 --> 38:38.795
What happened?

38:38.898 --> 38:40.397
I was taking Lulu to the vet.

38:40.499 --> 38:44.001
I found her on the ground with
her tongue sticking out and...

38:44.103 --> 38:45.669
[knocking at door]

38:45.771 --> 38:47.504
Doctor: Good morning.

38:47.606 --> 38:49.139
I'm Doctor Leibowitz.

38:50.743 --> 38:51.742
-Hey, Doc. -Hi.

38:51.844 --> 38:53.877
-How's she doing?
-Let's take a look.

38:56.582 --> 38:57.881
How are you feeling?

38:57.983 --> 38:59.082
Not good.

38:59.185 --> 39:00.384
Do you have any pain?

39:00.486 --> 39:04.188
A little. I feel a little numb.
Is that normal?

39:04.290 --> 39:06.590
You're still under the
effects of the anesthesia.

39:06.692 --> 39:09.860
You know you're really lucky.
You could've been paralyzed.

39:09.962 --> 39:12.596
When do you think we
could take her home.

39:12.698 --> 39:16.733
Her urea and creatinine numbers came
out a little high in the lab report.

39:16.835 --> 39:18.235
What's that?

39:18.337 --> 39:20.003
They're indicators
of kidney function.

39:20.105 --> 39:22.573
Have you had kidney
problems before?

39:22.675 --> 39:24.841
No. I don't think so.

39:24.944 --> 39:28.612
We'll need to conduct more tests to
really understand what's going on.

39:28.714 --> 39:31.014
Right now? Is that
really necessary?

39:31.116 --> 39:33.750
Can't we come back another
day and have them?

39:33.852 --> 39:35.452
Why would you want to do that?

39:36.689 --> 39:40.424
I want to get her home. I think
she'll recoup better there.

39:40.526 --> 39:41.959
I understand.

39:42.061 --> 39:44.027
I just want to make sure she's
clearly on the road to recovery.

39:44.129 --> 39:45.262
Who will be looking
after her at home?

39:45.364 --> 39:47.464
I will.

39:47.566 --> 39:50.601
Her mobility will be
restricted for some time.

39:50.703 --> 39:52.603
Can you take care of that?

39:52.705 --> 39:54.371
Of course.

39:55.808 --> 39:58.141
Alright, I'll sign the
discharge papers.

39:58.244 --> 40:00.777
But just know that I'm releasing
you against medical advice.

40:00.879 --> 40:03.080
-Well, maybe... -We're fine.

40:03.182 --> 40:04.448
We know that.

40:10.623 --> 40:12.022
Let's get you home.

40:40.919 --> 40:42.686
Hope you like it.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.288
I'm not hungry.

40:44.390 --> 40:47.157
Babe, you have to eat.

40:47.259 --> 40:48.191
How are you feeling?

40:48.294 --> 40:50.694
How does it look
like I'm feeling?

40:52.398 --> 40:53.830
You got presents.

40:56.135 --> 40:59.269
Monica sent you these snacks,
Kim sent you this flower,

40:59.371 --> 41:02.673
and Scarlett sent these magazines
so you wouldn't get bored.

41:04.276 --> 41:10.147
"Fifty ways to please your man
in bed." Sounds interesting.

41:10.249 --> 41:11.748
Not really.

41:14.453 --> 41:15.652
Hey...

41:18.590 --> 41:22.159
I'm just worried about
our insurance premiums.

41:22.261 --> 41:24.394
I'm sure they're
going to skyrocket.

41:24.496 --> 41:26.496
And then there's the health
insurance with the co-pays

41:26.598 --> 41:27.664
and the deductibles...

41:27.766 --> 41:29.599
I don't really know
what else to say.

41:29.702 --> 41:30.967
I'm really sorry.

41:36.442 --> 41:39.843
I was...

41:39.945 --> 41:43.580
I was talking to Monica...

41:47.586 --> 41:49.986
about the trust.

41:50.089 --> 41:53.256
And I think we should look
into using some of the money.

41:53.359 --> 41:54.825
No.

41:56.695 --> 42:00.030
Okay, I didn't want to
have to tell you this...

42:00.132 --> 42:04.668
but the company is going through some
financial difficulties right now

42:04.770 --> 42:06.203
and this money
could really help.

42:06.305 --> 42:08.105
That money is for
our kids future.

42:08.207 --> 42:09.573
It's ten million dollars?

42:09.675 --> 42:11.508
What are they going to do
with ten million dollars?

42:11.610 --> 42:14.277
I'm sorry, but I'm not
changing my mind.

42:16.482 --> 42:17.848
I see.

42:22.121 --> 42:23.620
Where are you going?

42:25.624 --> 42:27.157
I forgot your juice.

42:29.561 --> 42:32.729
I'm sorry that I've been
a little rude lately.

42:32.831 --> 42:34.431
I'm just a little cranky.

42:34.533 --> 42:36.900
That's fine. I understand.

42:37.002 --> 42:39.302
I'm sure we can make
some cuts in the budget

42:39.405 --> 42:42.038
and I'll sell some
stuff if we have to,

42:42.141 --> 42:45.108
but I really don't want to
touch my father's trust.

42:45.210 --> 42:46.810
I'm sure if your dad
were still alive

42:46.912 --> 42:49.780
and he saw what we're going
through he would change his mind.

42:49.882 --> 42:51.381
That would never happen.

42:51.483 --> 42:53.984
-How do you know?
-Because I know.

42:54.086 --> 42:55.786
How?

42:58.023 --> 43:00.056
You know, maybe I was wrong.

43:00.159 --> 43:01.925
I always thought your
Dad was the problem,

43:02.027 --> 43:03.226
but maybe it's you.

43:03.328 --> 43:06.163
Maybe it's you who
doesn't want to help us.

43:06.265 --> 43:08.064
He thought you were a bum.

43:09.501 --> 43:12.235
A worthless bum.

43:16.108 --> 43:19.109
When I married you he said that we
would never survive without him

43:19.211 --> 43:23.013
and I told him that we would
never touch his money.

43:23.115 --> 43:25.115
So, when the kids are old
enough to decide for themselves

43:25.217 --> 43:26.850
what they want to do with it,

43:26.952 --> 43:29.953
I'll tell them who he was and
where the money came from,

43:30.055 --> 43:33.223
but until then I
will not touch it.

43:41.867 --> 43:43.834
I have to go.

43:43.936 --> 43:48.305
Do you need me to call
someone or will you be okay?

43:48.407 --> 43:50.073
I'll be fine.

43:50.175 --> 43:53.176
Okay. Call me if
you need anything.

44:12.564 --> 44:15.265
Hey, it's done.

44:21.373 --> 44:25.575
[door opens and closes]

44:50.769 --> 44:52.669
[glass breaks]

45:38.917 --> 45:40.717
[startled gasp]

45:42.421 --> 45:44.421
What are you doing?

45:44.523 --> 45:46.890
I didn't want to wake you.

45:46.992 --> 45:49.159
I was just going to
give you a kiss.

45:50.929 --> 45:53.296
How are you feeling?

45:53.398 --> 45:55.165
Not good.

45:55.267 --> 45:56.833
What's wrong?

45:56.935 --> 45:58.668
My leg hurts.

45:58.770 --> 46:00.503
Oh.

46:00.606 --> 46:03.840
Could you get me some
pills from my purse.

46:03.942 --> 46:05.475
Sure.

46:05.911 --> 46:08.445
Let me go get you
some more juice.

46:08.547 --> 46:09.846
No.

46:09.948 --> 46:12.315
Just water.

46:12.417 --> 46:13.850
Okay.

46:16.622 --> 46:20.690
I spilled the juice. I'm sorry.

46:20.792 --> 46:22.492
How was your day?

46:22.594 --> 46:24.995
[cell ringing]

46:25.097 --> 46:27.697
Work stuff.

46:27.799 --> 46:29.633
[cell ringing]

46:29.735 --> 46:32.102
I have to take this. Sorry.

46:35.607 --> 46:37.040
I can't talk right now.

46:38.777 --> 46:42.479
I know. I need a couple
more days, that's it.

46:42.581 --> 46:48.551
Okay, we'll talk then, bye.

46:55.927 --> 46:57.127
Who was that?

46:57.229 --> 46:58.528
Nobody.

46:58.630 --> 46:59.829
Something from work.

46:59.931 --> 47:03.099
Why didn't you take it in here?

47:03.201 --> 47:05.602
I didn't want to bother you.

47:09.741 --> 47:12.742
I know you're seeing
someone else.

47:14.312 --> 47:15.645
I don't know what
you're talking about.

47:15.747 --> 47:18.448
You come home late
from work every night,

47:18.550 --> 47:23.420
we never talk, you never
want to sleep with me.

47:23.522 --> 47:26.022
Just tell me, who is it?

47:26.091 --> 47:27.323
Who is what?

47:27.426 --> 47:29.059

47:31.096 --> 47:32.395
You're being paranoid.

47:32.497 --> 47:34.264
I'm not an idiot, Phil.

47:34.366 --> 47:35.432
I know you.

47:35.534 --> 47:37.500
This is ridiculous.

47:37.602 --> 47:39.102
Is it one of my friends?

47:42.641 --> 47:44.607
If you're not happy
in our relationship,

47:44.676 --> 47:47.444
then we should work it out.

47:47.546 --> 47:48.745
Just talk to me.

47:48.847 --> 47:50.246
There's nothing to talk about.

47:50.315 --> 47:51.281
Why can't you just admit it?

47:51.383 --> 47:55.452
I'm not talking about this.
I'm not!

You didn't have to sleep
upstairs, you know.

48:36.027 --> 48:38.695
I'm sorry. Drink your juice.

48:40.866 --> 48:43.266
I really think we
should see a therapist.

48:43.368 --> 48:45.502
Fine. We'll see
whoever you want,

48:45.604 --> 48:46.736

the doctor said,

you need to drink your
fluids to get better.

Good. A little more.

49:02.754 --> 49:05.155
Of course I do.

49:06.792 --> 49:07.857
Where are you going?

49:07.959 --> 49:09.692
To the gym. I'll shower there.

49:09.761 --> 49:11.294
I'm sorry.

49:12.430 --> 49:14.931
I'm trying to make
things better.

49:16.201 --> 49:17.267
What did I do that was so wrong

49:17.369 --> 49:19.135
that we can't even
talk about it?

49:19.237 --> 49:21.104
Nothing.

49:21.206 --> 49:24.841
I'm not the kids from school who
tortured you. I'm your wife.

49:24.943 --> 49:26.242
I love you.

49:28.280 --> 49:30.346
I know you do.

51:23.461 --> 51:29.265
Yes, I just got home and found
my wife passed out on the floor.

51:29.367 --> 51:31.501
No! I don't know what
happened to her.

just on the floor.

51:46.584 --> 51:48.184
Doctor: It's a miracle
she's still alive.

51:48.286 --> 51:50.119
Her kidneys are
severely damaged.

51:50.221 --> 51:51.487
Do you know why?

51:51.589 --> 51:53.523
We're still trying
to figure that out.

51:53.625 --> 51:57.560
But in the meantime we're going to have
to put her on dialysis twice a week.

51:57.629 --> 52:00.263
Here's a pamphlet with
more information.

52:00.365 --> 52:03.266
She's gonna need lots of fluid
and no drugs or alcohol.

52:05.337 --> 52:06.936
Thank you, doctor.

52:14.279 --> 52:16.446
So, I'll be back later.

52:16.548 --> 52:20.016
I left you some food in the
fridge and look what came today.

52:20.118 --> 52:21.918
It's Lulu's ashes.

52:22.020 --> 52:24.420
I'll buy you a nice
vase to put them in.

52:50.782 --> 52:52.682
Hey, neighbor.

52:52.784 --> 52:54.717
Don't "hey neighbor" me.

52:54.819 --> 52:56.319
You lied to me.

52:56.421 --> 52:57.854
First you said she
was as good as dead

52:57.956 --> 53:00.823
and then you said she was on
board and none of that is true.

53:00.925 --> 53:02.492
I'm sorry. Okay?

53:02.594 --> 53:05.361
Things they got a little more
complicated than I anticipated

53:05.430 --> 53:06.829
but we can still figure it out.

53:06.931 --> 53:10.700
No, I already figured it out.
We're going to renegotiate.

53:10.802 --> 53:12.769
-What do you mean? -I want half.

53:12.871 --> 53:15.038
Half?

53:15.140 --> 53:16.739
Half?

53:16.841 --> 53:20.209
If you think I am giving you five
million dollars, you're crazy.

gonna have to pay for it.

You can't do this to me, Monica!
We had a deal.

53:31.189 --> 53:33.256
If you don't like it,
we can both go down,

53:33.358 --> 53:37.527

wrong tree, neighbor.

about is the money.

Yes, I was just wondering
if you had an idea

54:32.717 --> 54:35.084
of what may have caused
Lulu's kidney failure?

54:35.186 --> 54:36.953
<i> To have suffered such
a severe reaction,</i>

54:37.055 --> 54:39.789
she has to have ingested
something really poisonous.

bunch of stuff.</i>

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.166
How should I know?

01:05:45.268 --> 01:05:46.734
You're a divorce lawyer.

01:05:46.803 --> 01:05:50.838
How else would Phil have control
of my money, unless I'm dead?

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.774
Yes, I guess that's right.

01:05:54.344 --> 01:05:56.744
Well, she told you want
you wanted to know.

01:05:56.846 --> 01:05:58.780
I hope you're happy.

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:17.899
He tried to poison me.

01:06:18.001 --> 01:06:25.306
And I confronted him and
then he attacked me.

01:06:25.408 --> 01:06:26.774
And I had to shoot him.

01:06:26.876 --> 01:06:29.277
Are you sure he's dead?

01:06:29.379 --> 01:06:31.946
The bullet went through
his right eye and out...

01:06:32.048 --> 01:06:35.082
the top of his head so
yeah, I'm pretty sure.

01:06:35.185 --> 01:06:37.685
I'm sorry. I need to
go to the bathroom.

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:42.557
What are we going to do?

01:06:42.659 --> 01:06:44.292
I need your help.

01:06:44.394 --> 01:06:45.927
He didn't leave work
until five thirty,

01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:48.729
I need you to say that
I was here at five,

01:06:48.832 --> 01:06:50.097
like every Thursday.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:53.968
Gloria, the wife is
always the prime suspect.

01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:55.770
They'll interrogate you,

01:06:55.872 --> 01:06:58.673
they'll find inconsistencies
in your story,

01:06:58.775 --> 01:07:00.608
they'll look for gun
residue on your hands,

01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:03.211
this is what they
do for a living.

01:07:05.682 --> 01:07:07.949
I'm begging you.

01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:10.051
Please!

01:07:10.153 --> 01:07:12.720
Please back me up on this.

01:07:14.691 --> 01:07:16.090
I had no choice.

01:07:18.428 --> 01:07:20.528
It was either him or me.

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:24.031
You have to turn yourself in.

01:07:24.133 --> 01:07:28.269
I'll help you, we'll
plead self-defense,

01:07:28.371 --> 01:07:30.705
temporary insanity, whatever,

01:07:30.807 --> 01:07:32.874
but you don't want the police
digging into your business.

01:07:32.976 --> 01:07:35.176
-Trust me. -I can't.

01:07:35.278 --> 01:07:37.044
We'll take care of the kids.

01:07:37.146 --> 01:07:39.981
They'll understand. Right?

01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:42.884
I can't turn myself in.

01:07:42.986 --> 01:07:47.054
Now if you want to do
it, I can't stop you.

01:07:47.156 --> 01:07:51.492
I just don't understand why
he'd want to kill you.

01:07:51.561 --> 01:07:57.632
I think he wanted to take my
money and leave with someone.

01:07:57.734 --> 01:07:59.400
With who?

01:08:01.304 --> 01:08:03.237
One of you.

01:08:03.339 --> 01:08:05.239
One of us?

01:08:05.341 --> 01:08:07.742
Are you crazy? We're
your friends.

01:08:09.312 --> 01:08:10.645
Are you?

01:08:11.414 --> 01:08:12.580
What are you saying?

01:08:14.884 --> 01:08:17.952
I'm gonna go check on Kim.
Make sure she's okay.

01:08:24.594 --> 01:08:26.426
Listen to me.

01:08:26.529 --> 01:08:29.029
You're wrong about Scarlett.

01:08:29.131 --> 01:08:31.532
I'm her lawyer, I know
everything about her,

01:08:31.634 --> 01:08:34.835
and I can guarantee you
she wasn't screwing Phil.

01:08:34.938 --> 01:08:36.504
I know that.

01:08:36.606 --> 01:08:38.805
Well, I know you
don't think I was.

01:08:40.176 --> 01:08:42.076
I don't.

01:08:50.153 --> 01:08:53.154
[classical music]

01:08:58.995 --> 01:09:01.696
What are you doing here?

01:09:01.798 --> 01:09:03.029
I needed to see you.

01:09:03.131 --> 01:09:05.099
You're crazy. You gotta go.

01:09:05.201 --> 01:09:06.867
No.

01:09:09.538 --> 01:09:12.006
If you don't leave, I will.

01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:17.345
[classical music continues]

01:09:48.044 --> 01:09:49.643
Stay away from me.

01:09:49.746 --> 01:09:50.944
What' s the matter?

01:09:51.046 --> 01:09:52.813
People can see us, you know.

01:09:52.915 --> 01:09:54.482
Who cares?

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:56.417
Let them see.

01:09:57.387 --> 01:10:00.755
You told me you'd divorce her.
We would go away together.

01:10:00.857 --> 01:10:02.957
It's not that simple.

01:10:03.059 --> 01:10:04.625
I can lose everything.

01:10:04.727 --> 01:10:06.394
Then go back to Gloria.

01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:10.865
Wait.

01:10:10.967 --> 01:10:12.733
I'm working on a plan.

01:10:12.835 --> 01:10:16.537
Hey. I just need time.

01:10:17.607 --> 01:10:19.273
I already talked to Monica.

01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:20.674
What?

01:10:20.777 --> 01:10:22.610
You told Monica about us?

01:10:22.712 --> 01:10:25.713
No, relax, I didn't
tell her about us.

01:10:25.782 --> 01:10:28.682
I just told her I
wanted to leave Gloria.

01:10:28.785 --> 01:10:30.951
-She doesn't know the details.
-Damn it, Phil.

01:10:31.054 --> 01:10:32.953
I mean, you couldn't
find another lawyer?

01:10:33.056 --> 01:10:34.889
Not better than her.

01:10:34.991 --> 01:10:39.026
Besides, this way
Gloria can't hire her.

01:10:39.128 --> 01:10:40.828
Two birds, one stone.

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:44.999
You are one cold hearted son
of a bitch, you know that?

01:10:45.101 --> 01:10:47.935
I'm not the one sleeping
with my friend's husband.

01:10:50.907 --> 01:10:52.640
So what's the plan?

01:10:52.742 --> 01:10:54.708
I'm working on getting
some money together

01:10:54.811 --> 01:10:56.644
so we can start a life.

01:10:56.746 --> 01:10:57.978
Gloria's money.

01:10:58.081 --> 01:11:00.981
Who cares? It'll be
ours soon enough.

01:11:01.084 --> 01:11:02.149
I don't believe you.

01:11:02.251 --> 01:11:04.151
You're just trying to gain time

01:11:04.253 --> 01:11:06.287
so I'll be your
mistress forever.

01:11:06.389 --> 01:11:10.091
You gotta make a
choice, me or her.

01:11:14.697 --> 01:11:16.997
I've already decided.

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.532
One month.

01:11:18.634 --> 01:11:20.601
That's all I need.

01:11:20.703 --> 01:11:23.170
But how?

01:11:23.272 --> 01:11:26.340
The flight leaves on a
Thursday at midnight.

01:11:26.442 --> 01:11:30.911
So you go to your little
regular girls get together,

01:11:31.013 --> 01:11:32.580
and while you're there,
I'll go to my house,

01:11:32.682 --> 01:11:35.015
I'll pack up my things, the
kids will be at camp so...

01:11:35.118 --> 01:11:36.750
there won't be a problem.

01:11:36.853 --> 01:11:38.219
As soon as you're
done gossiping,

01:11:38.321 --> 01:11:40.521
you'll drive to the
airport and meet me.

01:11:52.735 --> 01:11:54.034
Gloria: Phil?

01:11:55.705 --> 01:11:56.704
Gloria: Phil?

01:11:56.806 --> 01:11:58.806
Soon, baby. Soon.

01:12:01.077 --> 01:12:02.176
Scarlett: Kim.

01:12:04.647 --> 01:12:06.180
Kim, are you okay?

01:12:43.719 --> 01:12:45.686
Kim? What are you doing?

01:12:45.788 --> 01:12:47.521
I'm gonna stab that bitch.

01:12:47.623 --> 01:12:49.423
What are you talking about?

01:12:49.525 --> 01:12:52.359
She's lying, can't you see?

01:12:52.461 --> 01:12:54.361
She figured out that
he's leaving her

01:12:54.463 --> 01:12:56.030
and she murdered him.

01:12:56.132 --> 01:12:59.166
She did all of this on
purpose, she's punishing us.

01:12:59.268 --> 01:13:01.635
Put the knife down. For god's
sake you're scaring me.

01:13:01.737 --> 01:13:04.038
I'm going to stab that
bitch in the heart.

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:07.041
Stop it! Put down
the knife down!

01:13:07.143 --> 01:13:08.876
I don't need another
dead body in my house.

01:13:08.978 --> 01:13:11.378
What's the game plan, huh?

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.713
I don't know.

01:13:12.815 --> 01:13:16.450
It's over. Let it go.

01:13:16.552 --> 01:13:18.085
Good.

01:13:20.556 --> 01:13:22.022
-What are you doing?
-I'm calling the cops.

01:13:22.124 --> 01:13:24.458
-No, you're not.
-You can't stop me.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.160
Hello, I'd like to report a...

01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:28.362
Stop!

01:13:28.464 --> 01:13:30.731
Phil was not the man
that you thought he was.

01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:33.467
And you're not the first person
he's screwed around with.

01:13:33.569 --> 01:13:35.069
We weren't screwing around.

01:13:35.171 --> 01:13:36.303
No?

01:13:38.241 --> 01:13:40.107
He's slept with everyone.

01:13:41.277 --> 01:13:42.576
You're wrong.

01:13:42.678 --> 01:13:45.012
What? Are you going to tell
me you two were in love?

01:13:45.114 --> 01:13:47.214
That man didn't
even love his mama.

01:13:47.316 --> 01:13:49.550
He didn't care if he hurt you.

01:13:49.652 --> 01:13:51.719
He didn't care if
he lived or died.

01:13:51.821 --> 01:13:54.722
The only thing that man
cared about was himself.

01:13:58.261 --> 01:14:00.661
Oh, keep going. I
want to hear it too.

01:14:06.135 --> 01:14:08.369
I saw you two at the party.

01:14:08.471 --> 01:14:12.439
I was looking for Phil and
I saw you behind the tree.

01:14:12.541 --> 01:14:13.774
I called out his name.

01:14:13.876 --> 01:14:16.510
It's not Kim's fault.

01:14:16.612 --> 01:14:17.878
Of course not.

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.346
It's all of you.

01:14:19.448 --> 01:14:21.915
Because any of you could have
stopped it but you didn't.

01:14:22.018 --> 01:14:24.218
You can't blame all of
us for your problems.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.853
Of course I can.

01:14:25.955 --> 01:14:27.888
Because you are all
heartless little people

01:14:27.957 --> 01:14:30.357
who think that money, and power,
and beauty are all that matter.

01:14:30.459 --> 01:14:32.026
You know, Gloria,

01:14:32.128 --> 01:14:37.931
I am so sorry we cannot
be all as good as you.

01:14:38.034 --> 01:14:40.768
Oh, I'm sorry I ruined
your trip to Buenos Aires.

01:14:43.506 --> 01:14:46.240
Scarlett: No! Stop!

01:14:46.342 --> 01:14:48.075
Stop! No!

01:14:48.177 --> 01:14:50.678
Gloria! What are you doing?

01:14:53.015 --> 01:14:54.848
-Gloria! -Oh, my god!

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:56.450
Stop!

01:15:03.025 --> 01:15:03.991
[all screaming]

01:15:04.093 --> 01:15:06.260
[gunshots]

01:15:06.362 --> 01:15:08.529
Oh, my god!

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.901
Hand me a towel! We need
to stop the bleeding.

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:16.036
Kim!

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.506
Oh, Kim!

01:15:19.608 --> 01:15:22.242
Don't just stand there,
call an ambulance!

01:15:22.978 --> 01:15:24.311
Hold on.

01:15:29.285 --> 01:15:30.651
Hold on, okay?

01:15:30.753 --> 01:15:32.619
We're calling for
help now, okay?

01:15:32.722 --> 01:15:34.421
Someone has been
shot at my house.

01:15:35.624 --> 01:15:38.125
We need an ambulance!

01:15:38.227 --> 01:15:39.893
Thank you. They're on their way.

01:15:46.502 --> 01:15:48.369
I think she's dead.

01:15:51.574 --> 01:15:54.575
You must be real
proud of yourself.

01:15:54.677 --> 01:15:59.513
Getting rid of your husband and
his mistress in just one night.

01:15:59.615 --> 01:16:01.281
The night's not over yet.

01:16:01.384 --> 01:16:03.016
What are you going to do?

01:16:03.119 --> 01:16:04.852
Kill us all?

01:16:04.954 --> 01:16:06.186
Should I?

01:16:06.288 --> 01:16:08.856
How do you know I won't
tell them everything?

01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:12.893
Just one word from Scarlett
and me and you're done.

01:16:12.995 --> 01:16:14.395
Maybe you should.

01:16:14.497 --> 01:16:16.363
But then you'd lose that
suitcase full of cash

01:16:16.465 --> 01:16:18.532
that you have hidden in
the trunk of your car.

01:16:38.988 --> 01:16:43.524
And that's when Kim lunged
at her with the knife

01:16:43.626 --> 01:16:47.461
and Gloria pulled out the gun.

01:16:47.563 --> 01:16:50.063
Can I get you anything,
Detective Brown?

01:16:50.166 --> 01:16:51.899
No, thank you.

01:16:52.001 --> 01:16:54.668
Why did Kim attack Gloria?

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:56.737
I'm just not sure.

01:16:56.839 --> 01:16:58.205
How about something to eat?

01:16:58.307 --> 01:16:59.840
I have some cheese and
crackers in the kitchen.

01:16:59.942 --> 01:17:01.208
Thank you, Scarlett,

01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:02.743
but I really need to get
done with this interview.

01:17:02.845 --> 01:17:04.578
Of course.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.914
Detective Brown: I just need you to
explain what you mean when you say

01:17:07.016 --> 01:17:09.149
you're not sure why
Kim attacked Gloria?

01:17:09.251 --> 01:17:12.252
Did she all of a sudden just pull
a knife on her with no reason?

01:17:12.354 --> 01:17:15.823
Gloria said something about a
trip and Kim just snapped.

01:17:15.925 --> 01:17:18.358
Maybe Gloria or Monica
can be more helpful,

01:17:18.461 --> 01:17:20.093
but that's all I've got.

01:17:20.196 --> 01:17:22.596
Does Gloria always carry a gun?

01:17:22.698 --> 01:17:24.231
I don't know.

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.333
Is the Chief treating you well?

01:17:26.435 --> 01:17:28.702
The Chief treats me fine ma'am.

01:17:28.804 --> 01:17:30.871
We're good friends,
the Chief and I.

01:17:30.973 --> 01:17:34.074
I hosted the fund raising dinner
for his campaign last year.

01:17:34.176 --> 01:17:35.609
Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:17:35.711 --> 01:17:39.680
Is there anything else that..
you can tell me?

01:17:39.782 --> 01:17:42.082
Anything else that might help
explain what happened here tonight?

01:17:42.184 --> 01:17:45.586
You know, your son
looks just like you.

01:17:47.389 --> 01:17:49.256
You know my son, too?

01:17:49.358 --> 01:17:52.960
Yeah, he works at the
pharmacy I go to.

01:17:58.801 --> 01:18:00.467
They're ready for you.

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:08.976
Don't you dare say a word.

01:18:14.049 --> 01:18:17.017
Can you please walk me through the night.
What happened?

01:18:17.119 --> 01:18:21.788
Oh, we met here like
we do every Thursday.

01:18:21.891 --> 01:18:24.258
We had some wine, talked...

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.492
Talked about what?

01:18:25.594 --> 01:18:28.629
You know, nothing
important, just gossip.

01:18:28.731 --> 01:18:30.297
How about Gloria.

01:18:30.399 --> 01:18:31.832
Did she talk about anything?

01:18:31.934 --> 01:18:35.135
Monica: I don't remember.

01:18:35.237 --> 01:18:37.137
Detective Brown: You're
a lawyer, correct?

01:18:37.239 --> 01:18:39.239
Monica: Yes, that's correct.

01:18:39.341 --> 01:18:41.008
You know what will
happen if you lie to me.

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:44.678
Yes, I am aware of
the consequences.

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:47.748
Why did Kim attack
Gloria with a knife?

01:18:47.850 --> 01:18:50.350
I suppose Gloria gave her
some upsetting news.

01:18:50.452 --> 01:18:51.752
Suppose?

01:18:51.854 --> 01:18:54.254
I don't know the
details, Detective.

01:18:54.356 --> 01:18:57.891
Do you think Gloria acted in
self-defense when she shot Kim?

01:18:59.762 --> 01:19:01.228
Monica: Yes.

01:19:03.699 --> 01:19:05.699
Okay.

01:19:09.805 --> 01:19:11.171
Whoa.

01:19:11.273 --> 01:19:12.606
Are you alright?

01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:15.709
Ah, yes. I'm fine.

01:19:15.811 --> 01:19:17.177
Where do you live?

01:19:17.279 --> 01:19:18.812
Cherokee Hills.

01:19:18.914 --> 01:19:21.281
That's quite a drive from here.
Are you sure you can make it?

01:19:21.383 --> 01:19:22.783
Yes, I'm sure.

01:19:27.089 --> 01:19:27.854
Let's go.

01:19:27.957 --> 01:19:29.389
Where to?

01:19:29.491 --> 01:19:31.625
I need to take you down to the
station for some more questions.

01:19:33.963 --> 01:19:37.397
I don't think that's really
necessary is it, Detective?

01:19:37.499 --> 01:19:41.969
It's been a long night and
Gloria is not going anywhere.

01:19:42.071 --> 01:19:44.471
I'm sure she can give you
everything you need tomorrow

01:19:44.573 --> 01:19:45.806
after she's had some rest.

01:19:45.908 --> 01:19:47.474
I'm just doing my job, ma'am.

01:19:47.576 --> 01:19:51.712
And we appreciate that, but I
think you got what you need.

01:19:51.814 --> 01:19:53.580
Scarlett...

01:19:53.682 --> 01:19:56.617
Please don't make me contact
the Chief at this hour

01:19:56.719 --> 01:20:00.053
about those Oxy prescriptions
your son's been peddling.

01:20:03.525 --> 01:20:05.125
Un-cuff her.

01:20:05.794 --> 01:20:07.160
You're free to go,

01:20:07.262 --> 01:20:08.195
but don't leave town before
the investigation is over.

01:20:08.297 --> 01:20:09.029
Do you understand?

01:20:09.131 --> 01:20:10.664
I understand.

01:20:14.436 --> 01:20:16.903
[detective on phone]

01:20:28.217 --> 01:20:30.117
Detective.

01:20:30.219 --> 01:20:32.285
Yes?

01:20:32.388 --> 01:20:34.021
I have something to tell you.

01:20:35.424 --> 01:20:36.590
What is it?

01:20:43.866 --> 01:20:45.632
You want to tell me something?

01:20:45.734 --> 01:20:47.300
Um... I must have forgotten.

01:20:49.538 --> 01:20:54.307
Call me if you remember. Here's my card.
Give me a call anytime.

01:20:55.844 --> 01:20:57.878
-You drive home safe. -Yeah.

01:21:04.153 --> 01:21:05.585
I just got off the
phone with the Chief,

01:21:05.688 --> 01:21:07.220
everything is fine.

01:21:07.322 --> 01:21:09.756
-Okay. -What now?

01:21:09.858 --> 01:21:12.993
I don't know. Start
over I suppose.

01:21:13.095 --> 01:21:15.162
Why don't you just stay here.

01:21:15.264 --> 01:21:16.430
I have plenty of space.

01:21:16.532 --> 01:21:19.499
No. I want to go home.

01:21:19.601 --> 01:21:21.268
What about Phil's body?

01:21:21.370 --> 01:21:23.437
I'll figure something out.

01:21:23.539 --> 01:21:26.239
You know, you never told us
how he tried to kill you.

01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:30.744
He was putting
antifreeze in my drink.

01:21:37.419 --> 01:21:40.320
Goodnight. Thanks.

01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:50.330
[cell phone ringing]

01:21:53.235 --> 01:21:54.434
Hello?

01:21:54.536 --> 01:21:55.602
Monica, it's me.

01:21:55.704 --> 01:21:57.037
How much wine did
you have tonight?

01:21:57.139 --> 01:21:58.705
I don't know. A lot.

01:21:58.807 --> 01:21:59.706
<i> Why?</i>

01:21:59.808 --> 01:22:00.974
Pull over.

01:22:01.076 --> 01:22:01.908
What's wrong?

01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:04.010
It's poisoned. Pull over!

01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:22.829
I'd like to report
an attempted murder.

01:22:22.931 --> 01:22:24.197
My husband.

01:22:24.299 --> 01:22:26.366
He tried poisoning me.

01:22:26.468 --> 01:22:29.603
He's boarding a flight
to Buenos Aires tonight.

01:22:29.705 --> 01:22:31.471
Yes.

01:22:35.878 --> 01:22:40.747
[The Barber of Seville overture]

01:23:10.012 --> 01:23:11.978
Oh, my god!

[overture continues]

01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:45.879

01:23:45.981 --> 01:23:47.247

01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:54.487
Oh, if it weren't for
these three women

01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:57.891
and our sacred Thursday
afternoon get-togethers,

01:23:57.993 --> 01:24:02.462
I can assure you, I would
not be here today.

01:24:05.033 --> 01:24:06.633
So, Monica...

01:24:10.339 --> 01:24:11.738
Kim...

01:24:14.776 --> 01:24:16.376
and Gloria...

01:24:17.646 --> 01:24:21.915
Please join me on stage as we
raise our glasses together.

01:24:23.185 --> 01:24:24.484
Phil, take one with the phone.

01:24:24.586 --> 01:24:27.487

give me the gun.
