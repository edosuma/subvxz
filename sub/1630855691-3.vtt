00:12.721 --> 00:15.306
My name is Kyung-ja Kim.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.225
Oh-nam Ju's mother,

00:17.892 --> 00:18.935
Kyung-ja Kim.

01:54.739 --> 02:00.620
MASK GIRL

02:01.287 --> 02:04.457
KYUNG-JA KIM

02:06.334 --> 02:07.836
I grew up with nothing.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.713
So I've always thought
dating was a luxury.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.675
I met my husband through a matchmaker.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.887
I didn't care about looks.
That never mattered to me.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.723
He told me he had a steady job,

02:20.807 --> 02:22.934
and that was enough for me to marry him.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.312
Plus, he didn't seem
like the type to have an affair.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.191
But even though he barely made any money,

02:30.275 --> 02:32.610
that fucking bastard
shacked up with some bitch

02:32.694 --> 02:34.070
right after we got married.

02:34.779 --> 02:38.074
So, after just three years,
our marriage came to an end.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.327
But do you know what?

02:42.036 --> 02:43.121
I was okay.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.957
Because I had my son, Oh-nam.

02:46.624 --> 02:50.003
I could do everything and anything
because I had him.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.808
Stand closer to the urinals.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.560
Don't miss, y'all.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.276
Hold it in.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.778
H-- Hold it in, hold it in, hold it in!
Get out!

03:15.862 --> 03:18.031
Out, out, out, get out, come on.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.450
Ugh.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.785
What did you eat, buddy? Damn.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.370
Sighs.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.664
After working my fingers to the bone,

03:26.748 --> 03:29.209
I was finally able
to open a small restaurant.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.419
I have seats available,
this way, c'mon, let's go.

03:31.502 --> 03:34.464
Cheonggukjang? Sure, I can make that.
Whatever, you name it.

03:34.547 --> 03:38.801
Hey! Hey! Hey you! Wait-- You think you're
the only one running a business here?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.595
You just took the custom--

03:40.678 --> 03:42.513
-I didn't drag them here, did I?
-Yeah, but--

03:42.597 --> 03:44.474
If they don't like your food,
they eat mine.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.976
If they don't like my food,
they can eat yours.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.646
-So stop bitching about it for a second.
-How dare--

03:49.729 --> 03:51.773
-Just a minute--
-You bitch!

03:51.856 --> 03:55.568
I had no choice but to be like that,
so that I could put food on the table

03:55.652 --> 03:57.070
and raise my child properly.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.280
-Get off me!
-Hey, stop!

04:00.531 --> 04:03.076
-Get your dirty hands off me!
-Ow! Let go!

04:03.159 --> 04:05.370
But raising a kid
was harder than I thought.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.748
When Oh-nam was little,

04:08.831 --> 04:10.667
some of his things would go missing.

04:10.750 --> 04:14.087
What do you mean, you lost it?
No way. I bought it two days ago.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.881
He would sometimes come home with bruises.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.007
What happened here?

04:18.716 --> 04:20.301
I fell when I was playing.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.929
Why are you
so clumsy and careless?

04:23.012 --> 04:25.640
He even came home
with gum in his hair one day.

04:25.723 --> 04:26.849
Oh my-- What is this?

04:26.933 --> 04:29.852
I don't even know
when it got stuck there.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.772
Oh my goodness. Come with me!

04:32.855 --> 04:34.274
Whenever something happened,

04:34.357 --> 04:37.443
I would think, "Maybe I'm not
taking care of him well enough."

04:37.527 --> 04:40.613
Even in pitch darkness,
may he learn to hear your voice!

04:40.697 --> 04:41.864
Amen, Lord.

04:41.948 --> 04:45.952
Oh Lord, may you be the light
that guides him through his sorrow.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.495
Under your authority, Lord,

04:47.578 --> 04:50.790
may he live a life of spreading your word
and praise with joy.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.086
May sister Kyung-ja Kim's son, Oh-nam Ju,

04:55.169 --> 04:56.587
receive your love

04:56.671 --> 05:00.008
and be guided into the wonders
of the path you created for him.

05:00.091 --> 05:00.925
Amen.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.097
I don't know
if it's because God answered our prayers,

05:06.180 --> 05:08.725
but it turned out
my son's grades were good.

05:09.225 --> 05:12.061
Even though I couldn't send him
to a good private school.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.605
Hey, Oh-nam, are you studying?

05:15.106 --> 05:15.940
Yeah.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.277
Good. Study hard.
You're going to medical school, my son.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.623
C'mon, Mom,
I can do it myself.

05:33.624 --> 05:35.626
Hey, wait. Are you embarrassed?

05:35.710 --> 05:37.378
Hmm, baby?

05:37.920 --> 05:40.131
My son is… all grown up now.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.966
You're all grown up.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.968
My son got accepted

05:44.052 --> 05:46.929
into a four-year college in Seoul,
just like that.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.891
It wasn't medical school,
like I wanted, but still.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.726
Oh my God, my baby!

05:51.809 --> 05:53.686
Would you look at that!

05:53.770 --> 05:54.645
Oh, man!

05:54.729 --> 05:57.065
You look so handsome.
So, so handsome, right?

05:57.148 --> 05:58.566
-Don't you agree?
-Oh yes.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.526
-Mom!
-He looks so handsome.

06:02.987 --> 06:06.407
Then one day,
he suddenly wasn't my little boy anymore.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.742
Once he got a job.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.911
Is this the colonial era?!

06:10.453 --> 06:12.163
What do you mean, "independence"?

06:12.914 --> 06:13.831
Hey, listen.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.668
Just because you're earning money
doesn't mean you should waste it.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.130
You do know that
living by yourself's expensive, right?

06:22.548 --> 06:26.427
You're not getting married or anything,
I mean, why would you wanna move out?

06:27.053 --> 06:30.139
I just wanna live on my own.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.729
You're saying,

06:38.106 --> 06:39.565
you don't wanna live with me.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.111
That's not it, no.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.906
-It's just that I'm too far from work--
-"Far from work"? That's bullshit! C'mon!

06:46.989 --> 06:49.700
It takes me two hours to get there
and two hours to get home.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.077
That's--

06:52.120 --> 06:53.871
Listen, when I was raising you,

06:54.497 --> 06:58.501
I'd make my way to work through storms
or even typhoons, and I wouldn't complain.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.796
You, on the other hand…
Four hours, really?

07:02.672 --> 07:03.506
Oh my.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.851
I thought that if I put my foot down,
he'd change his mind.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.311
But he left anyway.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.358
Not only did he leave,

07:22.900 --> 07:25.445
he wouldn't even let me
anywhere near his house.

07:29.907 --> 07:33.161
Oh-nam, my son,
I made some side dishes for you.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.203
Are you home?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.414
Mom, I told you
I didn't need any.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.625
I don't even have time
to make food and eat at home these days.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.710
You little punk!

07:40.793 --> 07:42.211
Why are you like this, huh?

07:43.254 --> 07:46.382
What, do I have to beg you
to eat these side dishes, huh?

07:46.883 --> 07:49.051
This is not how I raised you, you get it?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.261
This-- This is just--

07:50.344 --> 07:53.097
Mom, it's not like that.
I'm eating well, and I'm just--

07:53.181 --> 07:55.391
Enough is enough, ungrateful jerk.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.311
Wait, you know what?

07:58.394 --> 08:00.813
You know what?
I'm never coming here ever again.

08:02.106 --> 08:05.067
This time, let's just
cut ties for good, Oh-nam!

08:05.151 --> 08:06.486
You… take care!

08:07.361 --> 08:08.988
Damn rascal. I--

08:09.780 --> 08:11.866
Damn it, damn it… Argh!

08:31.135 --> 08:33.137
MY SON ♥

08:41.270 --> 08:43.189
He only called once after that.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.651
OHNAM RESTAURANT

08:46.734 --> 08:49.737
Is that how you treat your mother?
You don't call me anymore?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.907
I missed the call, okay?

08:53.407 --> 08:55.535
Would it kill you to try calling me again?

08:57.370 --> 08:58.621
You know what? Forget it.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.793
Only one bottle today, okay?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.679
So frustrating.
This is too much, too much.

09:15.471 --> 09:16.681
That little punk.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.517
How will he find someone?

09:20.226 --> 09:21.561
Despite everything,

09:22.103 --> 09:25.773
I had faith he would come back to me
to be the good son I know he is.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.568
I never thought he would just disappear.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.828
-Here you go, ma'am.
-Thank you.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.664
-Thank you, sir.
-Oh-nam? Oh-nam!

09:42.164 --> 09:44.375
Oh!
What's that smell?

09:44.458 --> 09:47.670
What's that smell?
It smells rotten in here. Ugh!

09:49.505 --> 09:52.633
Okay,
this is the bathroom.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.176
Oh my God!

09:54.844 --> 09:56.554
Have a look at this place.

09:57.930 --> 09:58.848
Goodness.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.934
Oh my! That's scary, uh?

10:02.018 --> 10:03.769
Oh God, who is that?!

10:04.937 --> 10:05.938
Hey, who are you?

10:06.439 --> 10:09.025
It's a life-size doll.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.945
Is that… not a… a person?

10:13.696 --> 10:15.114
No, it's a doll.

10:15.823 --> 10:16.741
A doll?

10:17.408 --> 10:18.326
Yeah.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.246
Oh boy.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.416
What the hell?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.669
It looks so much like a human.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.921
That weird kid.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.633
Why would he have
a doll on his bed like th--

10:33.716 --> 10:35.217
Jesus, oh my goodness!

10:35.301 --> 10:36.594
Damn it.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.305
Huh? What's wrong?!

10:39.388 --> 10:40.222
What is it?

10:43.434 --> 10:45.186
Ugh!

10:45.269 --> 10:48.898
Why are you
so surprised? Huh?

10:55.196 --> 10:57.948
No! Not my son!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.202
Oh-nam!

11:01.952 --> 11:03.287
-My--
-No, don't touch it!

11:05.456 --> 11:07.750
Oh! Ma'am? Ma'am!

11:08.376 --> 11:10.378
Are you okay? Ma'am!

11:10.461 --> 11:11.587
Officer Park!

11:11.671 --> 11:13.339
Hey! Call an ambulance. Hurry!

11:13.422 --> 11:15.675
-Yes, sir!
-Ma'am! Are you okay?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.802
A dismembered body
has been found in the house

11:17.885 --> 11:20.680
of a recently missing
office worker, Oh-nam Ju.

11:20.763 --> 11:24.100
To identify the body,
an autopsy is being conducted.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.937
Police are currently
investigating Ju's whereabouts,

11:28.020 --> 11:30.398
who was last seen leaving work in October.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.609
And also trying to find a connection
between Ju and the victim.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.279
According to a police official,
the DNA analysis…

11:37.363 --> 11:38.406
Um, excuse me.

11:38.489 --> 11:41.325
Uh, which one of you is Ms. Kyung-ja Kim?

11:42.368 --> 11:45.579
…as they are investigating,
all possibilities are open.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.164
SEOUL YONGCHEON POLICE
YONG-JIN SEO / JONG-HUN CHOI

11:47.748 --> 11:50.042
What are you saying right now?

11:50.918 --> 11:53.796
-It's not my son?!
-Correct.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.883
Oh my God!

11:57.967 --> 12:01.095
Oh my God. It's not my son,
they're saying it's not my son.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.305
-It's not my son!
-That's wonderful news.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.141
-I'm so glad.
-Then who--

12:05.224 --> 12:07.393
Who was in that, uh, black bag?

12:07.476 --> 12:10.604
Well, at this moment,
we don't have enough to identify him.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.148
We just know it's a man.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.358
Well, that's fine.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.318
As long as it's not my son.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.528
Oh my God!

12:17.611 --> 12:19.405
Oh, oh!

12:20.072 --> 12:22.658
Uh, can, uh, can--
can you get me some water?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.034
Water.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.622
So, um, ma'am…

12:30.374 --> 12:33.294
when was the, uh,
last time you talked to your son,

12:34.170 --> 12:35.004
by the way?

12:35.087 --> 12:38.716
About two weeks ago.

12:38.799 --> 12:39.800
Take notes.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.051
On my birthday.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.678
-Oh.
-"Birthday."

12:42.762 --> 12:46.557
Um, did your son
have problems with anybody, by chance?

12:46.640 --> 12:48.559
Problems? What problems?

12:48.642 --> 12:51.395
He always got along
with his co-workers and everyone.

12:53.689 --> 12:54.607
Wait.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.817
Why are you asking me about him?

12:58.944 --> 13:00.446
Oh, well…

13:02.907 --> 13:03.741
What is it?

13:05.075 --> 13:06.035
Do you think

13:06.619 --> 13:08.829
my son killed that man?
Is that what you think?!

13:08.913 --> 13:12.208
Well, ma'am, there's a chance he did,
there's a chance he didn't.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.668
-We just--
-You're fucking kidding me, c'mon!

13:14.752 --> 13:16.712
My son's not the kind of person
to hurt anyone!

13:16.796 --> 13:19.548
He pretty much faints
at the sight of blood!

13:19.632 --> 13:22.676
How the hell
could you even think he'd kill someone?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.012
Get lost, you jerks!

13:25.095 --> 13:28.432
Later that day,
the police went to Oh-nam's workplace.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.186
So I can't think of anyone
who was noticeably, uh,

13:32.269 --> 13:34.480
or particularly close to Mr. Ju.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.525
If there's anything I can say about him,

13:38.192 --> 13:41.529
it's that, uh, when, um,
things didn't go his way,

13:41.612 --> 13:43.405
he'd blow up, all of a sudden.

13:43.489 --> 13:47.159
So that would, uh,
startle me every once in a while.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.787
The last time I saw him
was when Mo-mi Kim quit.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.623
He came to me
to get her address to deliver her things.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.543
-Why did Ms. Mo-mi Kim quit?
-I don't really know.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.921
She gave me
her resignation letter out of nowhere.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.715
You're asking me if Mr. Ju liked Mo-mi?

14:02.675 --> 14:05.469
Uh, you know what, I'm not really sure.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.596
He wasn't a man of many words, you know?

14:08.222 --> 14:10.057
Mo-mi did say something once.

14:10.891 --> 14:14.353
Something like, how she felt
Mr. Ju was keeping an eye on her.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.648
However,
I thought she was overreacting.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.568
She does, um, overreact often, you know?

14:25.322 --> 14:28.158
Oh dear, the things I go through.
Come on in.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.953
The police searched Mo-mi Kim's place too.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.163
She threw everything away before she left.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.374
She said she was
going abroad or something.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.920
Was there anything
unusual about her when she left?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.423
-Unusual?
-Yeah.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.971
Oh. Uh, she looked like
she got plastic surgery.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.472
Plastic surgery?

14:50.556 --> 14:53.267
Yeah. I mean,
you know how after plastic surgery,

14:53.350 --> 14:55.686
they wrap the person's face
with white gauze?

14:55.769 --> 14:57.062
Her face was like that.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.732
At first I thought
someone beat her up or something,

14:59.815 --> 15:01.233
I was thrown off, you know?

15:03.611 --> 15:04.528
Was she

15:05.446 --> 15:06.780
with a man, by any chance?

15:07.281 --> 15:08.115
A man?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.910
No. She lived alone.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.871
I mean, did she ever come home
with a man before?

15:13.954 --> 15:16.332
Nah, never, she never did.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.001
Every once in a while
she'd put on really loud music

15:19.084 --> 15:22.087
and sing and dance like crazy,
but nothing else.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.634
All right. Thanks a lot.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.929
-Are you done?
-Yes, we're done.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.598
The police thought
that my Oh-nam and that girl

15:32.681 --> 15:34.558
had run off somewhere together.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.686
We have received information

15:37.770 --> 15:40.397
that a colleague of Oh-nam Ju's
disappeared as well.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.858
On the same night he went missing himself.

15:43.484 --> 15:47.196
We went to her hometown,
Daesan, and tried to talk with her family.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.783
Excuse me, when did you last speak
with Ms. Mo-mi Kim, your daughter?

15:52.034 --> 15:55.371
The corpse was found
in a studio in Yongcheon-gu,

15:55.871 --> 15:57.957
the home of the missing Oh-nam Ju.

15:58.999 --> 16:03.462
There were over 2,000 illegal adult videos
saved on his computer.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.342
A sex doll, as well as several adult toys,
were found at the scene of the crime.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.387
His apartment was filled
with pornographic toys,

16:11.470 --> 16:14.431
and that could point
to psychological issues.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.600
Chances are his perception of sex
was abnormal.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.479
The problem here is that the expression
of his desire

16:20.562 --> 16:22.356
would become twisted

16:22.439 --> 16:24.984
and found in the form
of stalking and obsession.

16:26.860 --> 16:30.322
Hey, you piece of shit.
I told you to find my son,

16:30.406 --> 16:34.118
but instead, you make him out
to be a pervert, stalker, and murderer?!

16:35.452 --> 16:38.956
I should just shred all of you bastards
to pieces or something!

16:39.039 --> 16:41.667
My son is a gentleman! He's a good person!

16:42.626 --> 16:44.211
There's no fucking way

16:44.294 --> 16:46.880
my baby did such a thing, you fuckers!

16:46.964 --> 16:48.841
Damn you, bastards!

16:48.924 --> 16:50.175
That's when I decided

16:51.051 --> 16:52.886
that I have to find my son myself.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.222
NEW BEGINNING

17:00.352 --> 17:01.437
Does it work now?

17:01.937 --> 17:03.105
Uh-- Yes.

17:03.731 --> 17:04.690
Thank you, mister.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.696
Hello. What's this?

17:18.287 --> 17:19.663
Uh, and what's this?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.626
Where'd the pointer go? Huh?

17:26.462 --> 17:27.379
Oh, damn it.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.965
What the heck is all of this?

17:30.049 --> 17:33.510
If I wanted to find my son,
I needed to know more about him.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.512
So I started taking computer lessons.

17:35.596 --> 17:39.058
Typing is one of the basics
of learning how to use a computer.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.810
It's not easy
typing with both hands right off the bat,

17:41.894 --> 17:44.271
so you'll learn to type
with each hand separat--

17:44.354 --> 17:48.567
If you're having a hard time with it,
I would recommend practicing at home.

17:48.650 --> 17:52.321
Today, we're going to look
at the basics of browsing the Internet.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.573
If you look at the desktop screen,
there should be--

17:54.656 --> 17:56.742
Today, we'll learn how to send an email.

17:56.825 --> 18:00.621
So an email is basically like
a home address to receive electronic mail.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.122
Your online home address!

18:03.540 --> 18:05.542
MASK GIRL

FAN CAFÉ FOR MASK GIRL LOVERS

18:10.923 --> 18:15.385
If I wanted to find my son,
I had to learn more about that girl.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.888
HOT POST
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT MASK GIRL

18:21.433 --> 18:23.185

Mo-mi Kim.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.522

18:26.605 --> 18:28.607
So she's a college graduate.

HANMI UNIVERSITY

18:30.317 --> 18:32.236
OH SHIT, TOTAL UGGO
NO WONDER SHE WORE A MASK

18:32.986 --> 18:34.196
"Uggo"?

18:34.279 --> 18:38.283
"She's like an orc. A real-life orc."

18:38.367 --> 18:40.786
Did they mean an orca?
But she's so skinny.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.871
Damn it, I don't understand any of this.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.166
To get any information from this,

18:46.250 --> 18:49.128
I had to learn the words young people use.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.921
KFM

18:51.004 --> 18:54.716
KEEP FOR MYSELF

18:54.800 --> 18:55.968
"No cap."

18:57.094 --> 18:59.138
That means "not lying."

19:00.264 --> 19:03.100
"S P O

19:04.268 --> 19:05.102

19:05.644 --> 19:06.562
"Suddenly

19:07.146 --> 19:08.897
Popping Out of Nowhere"

19:10.399 --> 19:11.358
Argh, damn it.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.610
This is ridiculous.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.528
CLOSED

19:17.865 --> 19:19.324
What? Are you closing?

19:19.408 --> 19:21.994
Oh, goodness.
Why would you SPON like that?

19:22.077 --> 19:23.328
"SPON"?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.205
Just forget it.

19:25.789 --> 19:26.832
You're closing down?

19:26.915 --> 19:30.043
-What will you do now?
-What else? I'm going to find my son.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.725
Over the last few decades,
I've saved up a lot of money.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.603
Will you be withdrawing it all?

19:47.686 --> 19:50.397
Why? Is the bank low on cash?

19:50.898 --> 19:51.899
No, it's not that.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.864
There was another person who was looking
for that bitch as desperately as I was.

19:58.947 --> 20:02.326
It was Teddy, the online fan café manager.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.704
Mr. Manager,

20:06.580 --> 20:08.081
hey, what's up, sport?

20:08.165 --> 20:09.666
MG LOVE: HIYA-HI. TEDDY.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.877
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: HAHA HELLO
GOOD 2 SEE U AGAIN

20:13.212 --> 20:15.088
It's my daily check-in.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.216
Teddy,

20:18.258 --> 20:19.593
you have

20:19.676 --> 20:20.928
worked hard.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.347
Goodness, not like that, no.

20:26.058 --> 20:26.892
Teddy,

20:27.601 --> 20:28.518
I think

20:29.019 --> 20:30.812
you're really diligent.

20:30.896 --> 20:31.772
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: HAHA THX

20:31.855 --> 20:33.398
Have you

20:34.066 --> 20:34.900
found

20:35.400 --> 20:36.276
anything,

20:37.527 --> 20:38.612
uh, cool?

20:40.781 --> 20:41.823
I FOUND SOMETHING FREAKING COOL

20:41.907 --> 20:43.283
Oh, what is it, what is it?

20:43.825 --> 20:44.660
Oh.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.120
What is it?

20:49.957 --> 20:51.416
I FOUND A WOMAN WHO I THINK IS MASK GIRL

20:58.924 --> 21:00.759
BUT I'M NOT TOTALLY CERTAIN…

21:00.842 --> 21:03.303
SO I HAVEN'T UPLOADED ANYTHING YET

21:03.387 --> 21:05.264
TAKE A LOOK

21:09.476 --> 21:13.230
Hi there, ladies and gentlemen.
Today, here at Gangcheon Plus Mart,

21:13.313 --> 21:16.441
we are having a sale
to celebrate our third year since opening.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.320
We'll be holding a big event
during the sales period. Come on in!

21:20.404 --> 21:22.030
So that's

21:22.990 --> 21:25.158
Mask Girl. You think so?

21:25.242 --> 21:28.996
I can't really tell.
Her face looks totally different.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.334
SHE PROBABLY GOT PLASTIC SURGERY

21:34.418 --> 21:35.377
Plastic surgery?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.337
BUT HOW SHE DANCES AND HER BODY
ARE SIMILAR TO MASK GIRL'S!

21:38.297 --> 21:41.383
THE WOMAN IN THE BACK
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT PLUS MART

21:41.466 --> 21:44.553
JINCHEON? GANGCHEON?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, LOL

21:47.556 --> 21:48.515
SHOULDN'T WE CALL THE POLICE?

21:48.598 --> 21:50.934
I DID. BUT THEY THOUGHT
IT WAS A PRANK CALL

21:51.018 --> 21:53.186
The bastards, they're useless.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.731
BUT I'M A BIT CONFUSED
HER BOOBS LOOK FAKE IN THE VIDEO

21:55.814 --> 21:56.648
Her boobs?

21:57.399 --> 21:59.943
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT SURE
CUZ MASK GIRL'S ARE ALL NATURAL

22:04.364 --> 22:05.532
YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE?

22:05.615 --> 22:08.201
OF COURSE HAHA
MY NICKNAME IS BOOB CONNOISSEUR

22:08.285 --> 22:09.536
Oh my…

22:09.619 --> 22:11.204
I TOLD U I BECAME MASK GIRL'S FAN

22:11.288 --> 22:13.081
ALL BECAUSE OF HER BOOBS

22:13.165 --> 22:14.750
SUCH PERFECT BOOBS ARE RARE

22:14.833 --> 22:16.335
You pervert.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.464
I guess I'm crazy for believing ya.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.598
Mom?

22:32.726 --> 22:34.019
Mom, wake up.

22:40.817 --> 22:41.818
Oh my God.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.571
Sweetie, are you here?

22:46.073 --> 22:46.907
Where are you?

22:53.413 --> 22:54.581
Mom?

22:57.084 --> 22:59.252
Oh-nam!

22:59.336 --> 23:00.170
Mom.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.714
Mom, I'm so cold.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.258
It's ok-- It's okay, sweetie.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.096
Get in here. Huh?

23:09.763 --> 23:10.639
Come to me.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.648
Sweetheart.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.526
Where have you been, honey?

23:24.319 --> 23:26.238
Where were you, sweetie?

23:27.155 --> 23:29.950
I missed you so much, you have no idea.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.413
Let me have a look…

23:34.996 --> 23:36.456
…at your face, son.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.241
Dear Lord…

24:18.874 --> 24:20.542
No! No!

24:21.710 --> 24:22.669
Lord!

24:23.795 --> 24:26.089
Oh-nam, no!

24:28.675 --> 24:30.093
My son!

24:42.981 --> 24:44.316
It's all because of her.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.860
It's her fault, she did this to him!

24:47.944 --> 24:50.739
She turned my son into this, that whore!

24:54.409 --> 24:58.705
Oh-nam-- Oh-nam, no, no!

25:00.582 --> 25:01.541
Ms. Kim.

25:02.083 --> 25:06.046
-Ms. Kim.
-Oh no, no, no, no, no!

25:07.214 --> 25:10.634
Why is this happening, Lord, dear Lord?!

25:11.635 --> 25:14.679
Around 8 a.m. today,
a man's dismembered body was found

25:14.763 --> 25:16.473
in a suitcase by a hiker.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.266
The victim is Oh-nam Ju,

25:18.350 --> 25:20.602
the missing person
and resident of the studio

25:20.685 --> 25:23.813
where another dismembered corpse
was found five months ago.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.858
The investigation is focused
on finding Mo-mi Kim,

25:26.942 --> 25:29.694
who is presumed to be deeply involved
in the case.

25:32.447 --> 25:33.323
My son

25:34.241 --> 25:36.451
has never done anyone harm.

25:38.328 --> 25:41.206
Even the thought
of killing a bug scared him.

25:42.123 --> 25:44.251
He was such a kind person.

25:47.712 --> 25:48.630
I've prayed.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.468
"Lord, what have I done wrong

25:53.552 --> 25:55.262
to deserve this punishment?"

25:57.597 --> 26:00.725
"Why would you give me sorrow
that I cannot endure?"

26:01.893 --> 26:03.853
"Is this truly your will, Lord?"

26:05.355 --> 26:07.524
"If you give me such sorrow now,

26:08.358 --> 26:10.569
how happy will you make me tomorrow?"

26:12.696 --> 26:14.281
"What will you have me do

26:14.364 --> 26:16.866
in your name on this earth, my Lord?"

26:21.621 --> 26:22.581
Only then,

26:23.915 --> 26:26.042
did I hear the voice of our Lord.

26:29.754 --> 26:30.672
"Daughter,

26:32.674 --> 26:34.217
my beloved daughter."

26:36.511 --> 26:37.929
"Go your way."

26:39.723 --> 26:42.892
"Even though you walk
through the valley of the shadow of death,

26:42.976 --> 26:46.229
I will protect you,
and I will be with you always."

26:46.313 --> 26:49.899
"No person will ever
be able to stand in your way!"

26:49.983 --> 26:50.984
"You are mine."

26:51.067 --> 26:52.736
"You're a soldier!"

27:35.153 --> 27:37.030
Who is it?

27:38.073 --> 27:38.948
Is this

27:39.574 --> 27:41.534
that bitch Mo-mi Kim's house?

27:41.618 --> 27:42.452
What?!

27:43.119 --> 27:44.537
Sorry, who is this?

27:45.872 --> 27:48.083
I'm the mother of the victim she murdered.

27:48.917 --> 27:49.834
Open the door.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.338
What the--

27:54.506 --> 27:55.340
Hello?

27:58.259 --> 28:00.136
Bunch of soulless assholes!

28:02.472 --> 28:03.598
Open the door.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.475
Open the door!

28:06.559 --> 28:08.978
You guys call yourselves human, huh?

28:09.062 --> 28:11.606
You're no better than animals!
Open the door!

28:11.690 --> 28:13.233
Open it, now!

28:15.110 --> 28:18.279
-You little bi--
-I am a housekeeper here, ma'am.

28:18.363 --> 28:22.409
My employer says she'll call the cops
if you don't leave right now.

28:24.494 --> 28:25.578
That little…

28:25.662 --> 28:29.582
She should be out here
begging on her knees for my forgiveness.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.918
Ma'am. Please.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.879
Woman, does she know
her daughter's a murderer?

28:35.463 --> 28:38.675
That hasn't been confirmed yet,
you know? And besides,

28:39.175 --> 28:43.346
my employer cut ties
with her daughter a long time ago.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.682
She doesn't know anything
about her daughter,

28:45.765 --> 28:47.767
and she doesn't even care to know.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.310
I'll tell you something else,

28:49.394 --> 28:52.647
I didn't even know she had a daughter
until this incident happened.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.773
Don't lie to me.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.318
Tell me where to find her,
and I'll leave right now.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.613
Oh dear, if I knew,
I would've told the police by now.

29:05.201 --> 29:06.494
What the…

29:07.078 --> 29:07.912
That…

29:10.290 --> 29:12.333
You fucking slut! You look like an owl!

29:12.417 --> 29:13.793
Come down here!

29:14.294 --> 29:16.337
Oh my God, look at that cold bitch.

29:16.421 --> 29:19.716
Even if she was begging for forgiveness,
I wouldn't be happy.

29:19.799 --> 29:21.801
That damn bitch
is acting like she's above me.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.303
How vulgar!

29:24.971 --> 29:27.265
Where do you think
you're going, you bitch?!

29:27.348 --> 29:31.186
Hey, ma'am! If you keep this up,
I'll have to call the cops, you hear me?

29:31.269 --> 29:33.438
-Oh my God!
-You didn't call them yet?

29:33.521 --> 29:34.355
Oh my God!

29:34.439 --> 29:38.151
I'll call them myself! Come out right now,
you fucking bitch! Argh!

29:40.445 --> 29:44.032
Ma'am, you came a long way.
Here, have some coffee.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.033
Here.

29:48.036 --> 29:51.039
The lady you harassed
said this time she'll let it go.

29:51.581 --> 29:55.168
But she said she won't let it slide
if you ever decide to come back.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.755
And the…

29:59.339 --> 30:01.299
What about the father, was he not home?

30:02.842 --> 30:03.718
Her husband?

30:05.345 --> 30:07.263
He killed himself a long time ago.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.530
Thank you for praying for my son.

31:05.613 --> 31:06.656
Sure.

31:06.739 --> 31:10.201
You know,
he was a pretty smart kid, Oh-nam.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.288
He could've totally
gone to medical school,

31:13.371 --> 31:17.584
but he threw a fit, saying he didn't like
the sight of blood, so he didn't want to.

31:18.167 --> 31:19.419
He was a great son.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.296
He really was the best son ever.

31:21.963 --> 31:24.924
He would insist on sending me money
whenever I wanted to travel.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.553
Plus, whenever I made him food,
he'd be so grateful.

31:28.636 --> 31:31.180
Wow! It's hard
to find sons like him, you know?

31:31.264 --> 31:33.975
-You're right.
-Mm-hmm.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.811
And the girls
were all crazy about him.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.064
Well, he was so polite and smart,
so of course they were.

31:40.148 --> 31:43.985
But none of them were enough for him
in my eyes. If I knew this would happen,

31:44.861 --> 31:47.322
I would've let him date anyone he liked.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.573
-Oh, sweetie…
-Oh my!

31:49.866 --> 31:53.703
-It's okay.
-Hey, it's okay. Don't cry. Oh.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.955
Aw.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.418
Oh, go ahead and eat.

32:00.501 --> 32:02.211
-Go ahead, c'mon.
-That reminds me.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.963
-Did you hear?
-Hmm?

32:04.047 --> 32:07.550
That uh-- That dentist over at Jeil Plaza,
have you heard?

32:07.634 --> 32:11.054
Apparently, he's having an affair
with his nurse!

32:12.096 --> 32:15.391
People who do perverted things like that
should really get a death penalty.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.392
-I agree.
-You're right.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.270
Wait, do you know
how they both got caught, though?

32:19.354 --> 32:20.188
How?

32:20.271 --> 32:23.858
The fortune-teller, Ms. Park,
mentioned it, do you remember that?

32:24.567 --> 32:27.528
-Well, apparently, she foresaw it all.
-What?!

32:27.612 --> 32:29.072
-What?
-She saw the husband.

32:29.155 --> 32:30.865
And saw the mistress too.

32:30.949 --> 32:31.866
-Oh my God!
-What?!

32:31.950 --> 32:35.954
-A churchgoer going to a fortune-teller?
-Relax, that fortune-teller's different.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.039
I've been there too, to tell the truth.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.123
Hmm.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.250
She's great. The real deal.

32:41.334 --> 32:42.251
-Really?
-Yeah!

32:42.335 --> 32:44.045
And… where is it?

32:44.128 --> 32:45.505
-Huh?
-I might wanna go too.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.215
Yeah! Let's go together.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.675
Jesus, don't be ridiculous.

32:48.758 --> 32:51.427
-The Lord is watching!
-You startled me!

32:57.058 --> 32:57.976
Hmm.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.733
Hmmmm.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.115
Jesus, you're making me anxious.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.492
Can you not see where she is?

33:14.575 --> 33:15.827
Hold on tight.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.166
West.

33:23.459 --> 33:24.585
She went west.

33:25.211 --> 33:28.089
I would die of old age
looking for her through "the west."

33:28.881 --> 33:31.092
I need you to give me her exact location.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.180
Here. I'll give you
all the money you want.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.572
Oh my Lord, please help me…

33:53.948 --> 33:55.074
Please, dear God, help me.

34:00.913 --> 34:01.831
It's here.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.711
Wh-- What's there? What is it?

34:08.880 --> 34:09.922
I see a river.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.509
And a piece of cloth.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.138
Gangcheon.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.057
Gangcheon?

34:20.224 --> 34:22.727
-Mm-hmm.
-Gangcheon, are you sure about it?

34:25.104 --> 34:26.981
This is it. This is the place.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.237
She's the girl dancing outside.

34:34.614 --> 34:35.448
Here.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.535
I'm not sure who she is.
Maybe you should ask someone there.

34:40.036 --> 34:43.122
-Sorry to bother, I just have a question.
-Oh, sure.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.833
By any chance, do you know this girl?

34:46.417 --> 34:49.253
Hmm. Uh, Won-ju, take a look.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.258
Oh, this girl.
She promotes events for us.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.970
-Is that so?
-But she hasn't been here in a while.

34:58.054 --> 35:01.349
Well, is, uh-- Is there something else
you could tell me? Like--

35:01.432 --> 35:02.517
Like her number?

35:03.142 --> 35:05.520
Uh-- She is-- She's my daughter.

35:05.603 --> 35:08.981
I haven't seen her since she left home.
After completing high school.

35:09.565 --> 35:12.360
Um, we have her agency's number, don't we?

35:13.194 --> 35:15.363
Uh, give her that number, would you?

35:15.446 --> 35:17.281
-Oh, thank you, sir.
-Uh, sure.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.075
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.995
-I can sleep in peace now.
-Yep.

35:41.430 --> 35:44.058
This bastard's
crushing me today. Jesus.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.228
Guess it's one of those
lucky days for me.

35:50.273 --> 35:51.399
Looking for somethin'?

35:52.817 --> 35:54.735
Actually, I'm looking for someone.

35:54.819 --> 35:55.653
Who?

35:56.946 --> 35:58.990
I think you got the wrong place.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.160
I heard this girl used to work here.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.709
Ah… Yu-mi.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.295
Yu-mi?

36:13.421 --> 36:14.589
She quit, ma'am.

36:14.672 --> 36:15.965
Really? Are you sure?

36:16.048 --> 36:19.510
She said she was gonna
find a better-paying job, so she quit.

36:20.094 --> 36:22.889
-Crazy chick.
-Did she say what kinda job?

36:24.015 --> 36:25.224
What do you think a girl

36:25.308 --> 36:28.394
with her face, body, and figure
would do to make good money?

36:29.729 --> 36:31.105
Goddamn it! I fold.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.535
No, I've never seen her.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.787
Wait, just have
a better look at her, c'mon.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.258
Uh, no, I've never seen her before.

-There you go, ma'am. Enjoy your food.
-Thank you.

37:30.122 --> 37:33.209
Mm-hmm. Welcome. What can I get you?

37:33.834 --> 37:36.254
-Can I get some sliced soondae?
-Sure.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.547
I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.970
Hello, sir.
Yes, I'll be right there.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.055
Sure.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.783
-Enjoy your food.
-Thank you.

38:05.866 --> 38:07.743
Sure thing, have a good one!

38:18.462 --> 38:19.297
Just leave it.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.622
Two boxes of whiskey. Yeah, beer too.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.751
Beer, three boxes of beer, dry snacks…
Yeah. Great.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.294
-Take care of this.
-Yes, sir.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.546
Hey, Chun-ja, c'mon.
I can see your panties!

39:01.547 --> 39:04.842
You drank again yesterday, didn't you?
I told you not to drink!

39:04.925 --> 39:06.260
Whoa, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am!

39:06.344 --> 39:09.930
Who are you? You can't go in there!

39:10.473 --> 39:11.849
Uh, you see, I--

39:12.725 --> 39:15.186
I just saw my daughter.
She was walking that way.

39:16.020 --> 39:19.023
-Your daughter?
-She, uh-- She just walked in.

39:19.106 --> 39:20.858
She-- She was wearing a denim skirt

39:20.941 --> 39:23.277
and long shoes
that come up to here, you know?

39:23.361 --> 39:24.278
Denim?

39:25.237 --> 39:27.740
-Ah, Mi-ae.
-"Mi-ae"?

39:27.823 --> 39:31.577
Uh-huh. When she's out, I'll tell her
you came by. She's busy at the moment.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.537
Not right now. Bye now. Here.

39:33.621 --> 39:34.955
-Wait. Wait a minute.
-Huh?

39:35.039 --> 39:36.374
Please don't tell her

39:36.457 --> 39:38.292
that I came by, is that okay?

39:38.376 --> 39:42.546
I-- If she finds out I came here,
my-- my daughter will be furious.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.423
-You know her.
-Right.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.051
How would she feel
knowing that her mom knows she works here?

39:47.134 --> 39:49.637
-Okay, ma'am, I understand. Go now!
-Right.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.554
Uh-huh. Go on.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.349
-Not a word.
-Of course, not a word.

39:53.849 --> 39:55.935
-Mi-ae.
-Yeah, Mi-ae, Mi-ae. Uh-huh.

39:56.018 --> 40:00.231
Bye now, ma'am. Bye. Goodbye!

40:23.379 --> 40:24.964
Hey! What are you doing?!

40:59.790 --> 41:02.460
Mom! Save me, please!

41:05.921 --> 41:07.339
Oh-nam!

41:11.260 --> 41:12.428
Oh-nam!

41:20.561 --> 41:22.938
Oh-nam!

41:30.863 --> 41:32.072
Mom.

41:35.868 --> 41:38.204
You didn't save me. Why didn't you, huh?

41:41.290 --> 41:42.458
I'm sorry.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.669
You were embarrassed of me, weren't you?

41:47.296 --> 41:48.797
What are you saying?

41:52.343 --> 41:54.220
I couldn't get into medical school,

41:54.303 --> 41:57.181
and I never dated anyone,
so you were embarrassed of me!

41:57.264 --> 41:58.891
You actually wanted me to die!

41:58.974 --> 42:01.644
No! No!

42:01.727 --> 42:03.479
That's not true.

42:04.813 --> 42:06.815
You're glad I'm dead!

42:07.316 --> 42:09.068
I'm sorry, son--

42:10.152 --> 42:11.445
I'm sorry…

42:16.158 --> 42:17.076
Scuse me.

42:18.244 --> 42:19.286
Are you all right?

42:21.163 --> 42:22.665
Ma-am, hey!

44:15.152 --> 44:18.656
You're always being judgmental. Hmm?

44:18.739 --> 44:19.990
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

44:20.824 --> 44:24.536
-How can I help you?
-I'm here to, uh, get my hair done.

44:24.620 --> 44:27.331
Oh. Are you looking
for a specific hairdresser?

44:28.415 --> 44:30.417
What dresser? Just do my hair.

44:31.502 --> 44:34.755
-Yeah, so he went home, just like that.
-Oh my gosh, that's crazy.

44:34.838 --> 44:37.383
Wow, he's such a jerk!
Like, just, wow!

44:37.466 --> 44:40.386
He's gotta be crazy, I mean…
You know what?

44:40.469 --> 44:42.304
I think that jerk is ghosting you.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.223
I'm the crazy one.

44:44.306 --> 44:46.642
He's so annoying!
Why did I ever agree to this?

44:46.725 --> 44:48.686
Let's go wash your hair, shall we?

44:49.269 --> 44:52.690
He said he was a genius,
and I totally fell for it. Damn it.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.233
Oh, forget him.

44:55.859 --> 44:58.237
Hello, ma'am. What look are you going for?

44:58.946 --> 45:01.448
I, uh, wanna wash my hair first.

45:01.532 --> 45:02.366
Sure.

45:03.826 --> 45:05.285
Please have a seat over here.

45:07.996 --> 45:09.498
Hold on just a sec.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.756
All right, you can lie down, please.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.847
I think I've seen that necklace before.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.057
Where did I see it?

45:33.439 --> 45:34.773
USB DEVICE RECOGNIZED

45:43.407 --> 45:44.241
MASK GIRL

46:02.259 --> 46:03.177
Found it.

46:04.470 --> 46:05.721
I finally found it.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.771
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY REQUESTS A 1:1 CHAT

46:13.854 --> 46:15.898
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: MG LOVE,

46:22.362 --> 46:23.906
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: DON'T BE FREAKED OUT!

46:25.574 --> 46:26.617
I'M IN GANGCHEON

46:26.700 --> 46:27.701
Hm?

46:33.624 --> 46:35.417
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY: I'VE BEEN THINKING...

46:35.501 --> 46:37.544
I THINK THAT WOMAN REALLY IS MASK GIRL!

46:37.628 --> 46:38.837
MG LOVE: REALLY?

46:38.921 --> 46:40.881
MASK GIRL ♥ TEDDY:
I WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET IN THE VIDEO

46:42.633 --> 46:44.635
APPARENTLY, HER MOM

46:44.718 --> 46:47.012
WAS LOOKING FOR HER IN GANGCHEON!

46:47.095 --> 46:48.680
CONSIDERING ALL THAT

46:48.764 --> 46:52.226
I THINK SHE'S REALLY MASK GIRL, BUT…

46:52.309 --> 46:54.311
What does he think he is, a detective?

47:02.569 --> 47:03.737
TAXICAB DRIVER'S LICENSE
KYUNG-JA KIM

47:03.821 --> 47:06.907
Wow! You got this license
a long time ago, huh?

47:07.658 --> 47:09.243
Are you sure you can handle it?

47:10.410 --> 47:12.788
-Aren't you too old?
-Don't worry about it.

47:13.413 --> 47:15.040
I know the gas and brake pedal.

47:41.358 --> 47:42.484
I'm here to buy a gun.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.529
You're the lady who called us?

47:46.697 --> 47:49.324
Shit! Just my luck.

47:51.451 --> 47:53.412
I heard it's three million won.

47:55.163 --> 47:56.164
Here's ten million.

48:04.715 --> 48:08.760
This one. This is a Glock.
Straight from Austria. Eh?

48:10.304 --> 48:12.347
For a madam like you,
though, this is too, uh--

48:12.431 --> 48:13.265
Forget that.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.517
I want the most powerful one.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.396
The most powerful one?

48:21.231 --> 48:22.357
This one.

48:25.611 --> 48:26.445
Hmm?

48:32.743 --> 48:34.286
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

48:34.369 --> 48:35.370
This is good enough.

48:45.255 --> 48:47.507
In you go!

48:47.591 --> 48:49.468
Oh, come on.

48:49.551 --> 48:52.429
Get in the taxi behind me.
I'm not working tonight.

48:52.512 --> 48:55.474
-Damn it. What the hell, seriously?!
-Come on!

48:55.557 --> 48:57.225
Come on.

48:58.936 --> 49:00.771
C'mon, let's go home.

49:02.606 --> 49:05.817
VACANT

49:23.585 --> 49:26.797
Uh, you must be exhausted
from working so late, huh?

49:27.589 --> 49:28.924
Oh. Yeah.

49:29.007 --> 49:31.259
You know, you look
about my daughter's age.

49:32.928 --> 49:33.845
How old are you?

49:34.721 --> 49:36.223
I'm 28.

49:36.306 --> 49:38.600
Wow. You're the same age as her.

49:38.684 --> 49:39.685
As my daughter.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.605
Is that so?

49:57.494 --> 49:59.162
Excuse me, miss.

50:00.580 --> 50:03.208
My phone fell under the seat
in front you here.

50:03.291 --> 50:05.127
Could you pick it up for me?

50:05.210 --> 50:07.212
Yeah.

50:10.507 --> 50:11.591
I can't find it.

50:12.175 --> 50:14.094
-Is it not there?
-Where is it?

50:14.636 --> 50:17.681
-I don't see it.
-Oh. It's right here. It's here.

50:17.764 --> 50:19.016
What?

51:17.741 --> 51:18.992
Awake, are you?

51:34.341 --> 51:36.843
Somebody help! Help!

51:37.344 --> 51:40.347
-Please, anyone! Help!
-Help, please!

51:40.430 --> 51:43.141
Help!

51:50.440 --> 51:54.277
What's the matter with you?
Why are you doing this? Who are you?

52:02.869 --> 52:04.079
You don't know who I am?

52:04.663 --> 52:06.039
I really don't.

52:07.374 --> 52:09.543
I have no idea!
Why the hell are you doing this?

52:15.715 --> 52:19.094
Wait, ma'am, ma'am.
Wait. Please, wait a minute.

52:20.011 --> 52:21.263
I'm sorry.

52:23.181 --> 52:24.850
I don't know what I did wrong,

52:26.184 --> 52:27.727
but I'll do anything you want.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.110
You're back to your senses, apparently.

52:44.911 --> 52:45.912
Who is that person?

52:50.208 --> 52:51.251
You don't know him?

52:53.295 --> 52:54.379
You little…

52:54.462 --> 52:55.755
Ma'am!

52:55.839 --> 52:58.383
I don't know him, I swear to you!

52:59.134 --> 53:01.928
I've never seen this man
in my life!

53:03.305 --> 53:04.764
I do know who you are.

53:05.682 --> 53:06.766
Your real name

53:07.559 --> 53:08.643
is Mo-mi Kim.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.854
Mo-mi Kim?

53:11.771 --> 53:14.274
What do you mean?
I'm Chun-ae Kim! You're wrong!

53:15.150 --> 53:16.818
"Chun-ae Kim," huh?

53:17.319 --> 53:18.361
What a tacky name.

53:19.362 --> 53:21.865
So how many names do you have?

53:21.948 --> 53:24.117
Right…

53:25.702 --> 53:26.912
Is this not you?

53:27.537 --> 53:28.830
Yu-mi Choi?

53:30.123 --> 53:31.499
How did you get this?

53:34.085 --> 53:35.837
Do you still feel like lying?

53:36.421 --> 53:38.882
-I'm telling the truth!
-You damn bitch!

53:42.719 --> 53:45.305
Stay still or I'll stomp
all over your face.

53:52.103 --> 53:53.563
Wh-- What's the mask for?

53:56.399 --> 53:57.317
Ma'am?

53:57.984 --> 53:59.277
Why are you doing this?

53:59.819 --> 54:01.446
It's really not me.

54:01.947 --> 54:04.282
Please… Please don't do this.

54:05.408 --> 54:07.702
I've never heard
of the name Mo-mi Kim before.

54:07.786 --> 54:10.789
You lie
every time you open your mouth, you bitch.

54:10.872 --> 54:12.707
Now that I see you like this,
I'm sure of it.

54:12.791 --> 54:15.877
-It's really not me.
-It's you. It is you!

54:18.171 --> 54:21.383
Ma'am, I'm telling you,
it's really not me.

54:25.470 --> 54:26.930
Why are you doing this?

54:27.013 --> 54:28.723
You wore that mask

54:29.641 --> 54:31.726
when you killed my son, didn't you?

54:32.602 --> 54:36.606
Ma'am, why would I kill your son?
It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!

54:36.690 --> 54:39.276
I've never seen your son in my life,
I swear to God!

54:39.359 --> 54:41.319
I've looked at your photos

54:41.403 --> 54:43.989
as many times as I've looked at my son's.

54:45.699 --> 54:48.910
The necklace you're wearing,

54:49.828 --> 54:52.205
it's the same as the one in the picture.

54:53.415 --> 54:55.125
Necklace?

55:12.517 --> 55:15.645
Are you going crazy now, bitch?

55:21.234 --> 55:24.237
I think--
I think I know who that girl is.

55:25.488 --> 55:26.406
What?!

55:30.076 --> 55:32.245
You said her name's Mo-mi Kim, didn't you?
