09:42.123 --> 09:44.041

09:48.921 --> 09:51.882

10:30.588 --> 10:31.172

too fast.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.092
Yes, I know.

10:37.136 --> 10:41.515
Princess Astral, as you prepare
to walk about the Others,

10:41.599 --> 10:44.477
remember to keep your
true identity hidden.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.228
Your faerie powers
can help you,

10:46.312 --> 10:50.399
but they can also lead you to
grave danger if discovered.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.651
At the end of ninety days, you
will have to make a choice.

10:52.735 --> 10:56.364
Return to Athenia
and someday be queen,

10:56.447 --> 10:58.699
or stay away and live
as an Other...forever.

10:58.783 --> 11:04.246
Use your power and
your time wisely.

11:04.330 --> 11:04.872

Now you owe
me a secret.

19:30.335 --> 19:30.878
<i>Woah.</i>

19:30.961 --> 19:32.254
<i>That was</i>
<i>some breeze.</i>

19:32.337 --> 19:34.256
Oh you're
still here?

19:35.841 --> 19:36.925
Tristan, come on.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.260
I have to show
you something.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.846
You still owe
me a secret.

19:43.932 --> 19:44.975
You glimmered him?

19:45.058 --> 19:47.978
I had to make him forget
what a fool I made of myself.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.396
{\an1}And what happens if
he does fall for you?

19:49.479 --> 19:51.148
{\an1}Are you really
willing to give up

19:51.231 --> 19:54.443
{\an1}being Faerie Queen
for Prom Queen?

19:54.526 --> 19:57.237
{\an9}<i>♪</i>

20:00.490 --> 20:01.325
<i>Peter: I'm home.</i>

20:03.368 --> 20:04.244
Hey, Dad.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.954
Hey, D.

20:06.038 --> 20:06.413
Astral.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.831
How was school?

20:07.915 --> 20:09.791
School was great.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.002
I learned
everything!

20:12.085 --> 20:15.964
She spent an hour reading
about how gum was made.

20:16.048 --> 20:16.965
What is that?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.800
{\an1}A public works
building.

20:18.884 --> 20:19.968
My new project.

20:20.052 --> 20:20.886
{\an1}What do
you think?

20:20.969 --> 20:24.932
Could use some water and
trees and flowers.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.183
Well, I'm sure we can
throw in more greenery

20:26.266 --> 20:28.977
{\an1}when the
time comes.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.147
I'm gonna go get
dinner started.

20:32.230 --> 20:33.273
Wanna watch TV?

20:33.357 --> 20:37.069
More than anything I've
wanted to do my whole life.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.447
We promised her we
wouldn't spy.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.281
I'm her mother.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.076
It's what I do.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.453
What ever happened to
that exchange student

20:46.536 --> 20:48.330
{\an1}who was supposed
to live there?

20:50.540 --> 20:51.458
<i>Hello?</i>

20:51.541 --> 20:55.337
Must have made a wrong
turn at Main Street.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.339
Let's see here.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.222
Whooaaa!

21:07.557 --> 21:08.558
I'm starving.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.478
Please don't eat me I'm
sorry, I won't do it again.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.313
Ahhhh!

21:13.397 --> 21:15.399
Ahhhh!
