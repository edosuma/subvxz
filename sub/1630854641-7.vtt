00:24.867 --> 00:27.567
We don't have a whole

00:27.567 --> 00:30.667
We need to get as
much gold as we can

00:36.867 --> 00:39.066

Come up, Bryan.

00:51.066 --> 00:51.800
[narrator] <i>...and ruin?</i>

00:51.867 --> 00:53.266
[Kris] Wow, where's the gold?

00:54.467 --> 00:55.700
We're [bleep].

01:10.367 --> 01:13.300
So, I should be on the water
today with my big operation

01:13.367 --> 01:14.667
but, I'm--

01:14.667 --> 01:18.767
I'm learning a lot of hard
[bleep] lessons this year.

01:18.767 --> 01:19.467
Hard.

01:20.066 --> 01:21.634
Painful.

01:21.634 --> 01:25.000
I'm gonna-- It's so painful
I'm probably gonna be
feeling it next year,

01:25.000 --> 01:26.667
all the [bleep] that
I've learnt this year.

01:28.867 --> 01:31.567
Yeah, I'm gonna be walking
with a limp, dragging one leg

01:31.567 --> 01:34.100
getting [bleep] so
hard this year.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.667
[narrator] <i>Kris Kelly's</i>
<i>season is swinging</i>
<i>in the wrong direction.</i>

01:37.667 --> 01:41.767
<i>His excavator barge,</i>
<i>the</i> Mistress <i>may</i>
<i>be down for the count.</i>

01:41.767 --> 01:45.100
<i>So, now he's forced to rely</i>
<i>on his suction dredge,</i>

01:45.100 --> 01:46.967
<i>the newly revamped</i> Reaper.

01:48.767 --> 01:50.867
A lot of realization going on.

01:50.867 --> 01:54.367
So, I realized the <i>Mistress</i>
is pissing me right off
beyond belief.

01:54.367 --> 01:57.000
[Brad] Throw a reef out.
Rest in peace.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.867
You know what?
Shut the [bleep] up.
What would you know?

01:58.867 --> 02:01.467
-You can't even get
this [bleep] boat going.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:01.467 --> 02:02.967
-Calm down.
-You know this [bleep] boat,

02:02.967 --> 02:04.500
-that's the easiest
thing in the world.
-Andy.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.567
[Kris] <i>The</i> Mistress
<i>isn't done.</i>

02:08.367 --> 02:10.266
<i>So, this is where</i>
<i>I'm at right now.</i>

02:10.266 --> 02:11.767
The goal was 500 ounces.

02:11.767 --> 02:14.100
Right now we barely
have 20 ounces.

02:14.166 --> 02:17.266
<i>I've got a $125,000</i>
<i>payment in two weeks</i>

02:17.266 --> 02:19.300
and we're no where
near close to that.

02:19.367 --> 02:22.400
<i>The computer for the excavator</i>
<i>on the</i> Mistress <i>is fried.</i>

02:22.467 --> 02:24.300
<i>So, it's down</i>
<i>until it's repaired.</i>

02:24.367 --> 02:26.200
<i>All I have right now</i>
<i>is the new</i> Reaper

02:26.266 --> 02:28.000
<i>which has got no</i>
<i>gold this season.</i>

02:28.066 --> 02:31.767
But right now I do
have a Hail Mary
plan to save the day.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.000
-We're almost there!
-[man] Yeah.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.867
[Kris] Get Anthony ready
to drag that rear.

02:36.867 --> 02:39.166
I'm coming to learn some
things from Kris and Andy.

02:40.567 --> 02:43.667
Right now I need another diver
on the <i>Reaper</i> with Andy and I

02:43.667 --> 02:47.867
so we can work as many
hours as we can and get
gold the rest of the time.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.800
<i>So, I'm gonna give</i>
<i>my buddy Anthony a shot.</i>

02:50.467 --> 02:51.567
I hope he delivers.

02:58.567 --> 03:01.467
So, right now, we're
on a hunt for cobble.

03:01.467 --> 03:04.767
So, we're gonna drive
around for a little bit
until we find a cobble bed.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.100
And then we're gonna
start prospecting there.

03:07.166 --> 03:11.100
You know, just because
cobble is 100 times
easier to see gold.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.200
We don't have time
to look around for cobble,

03:15.266 --> 03:18.000
we don't have an underwater
camera right now either.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
<i>So basically we're gonna use</i>
<i>the anchor to find us cobble.</i>

03:22.467 --> 03:24.367
It's called anchor trolling.

03:24.367 --> 03:26.767
<i>You pull the anchor along</i>
<i>with you when you drive.</i>

03:26.767 --> 03:28.900
<i>If you feel super soft,</i>
<i>it's sand.</i>

03:28.967 --> 03:31.900
<i>If you can feel something</i>
<i>resisting, banging,</i>
<i>like a clanging,</i>

03:31.967 --> 03:34.867
<i>"bing, bing, bing,</i>
<i>bing, bing," it's cobble.</i>

03:34.867 --> 03:38.266
It's not an exact
science but it's the best
we have right now.

03:38.266 --> 03:39.800
Okay, now we sit here.

03:39.867 --> 03:42.700
It's like trolling,
trolling for cobble.

03:42.767 --> 03:48.367
So you sit here and you feel
sand, sand, sand, sand, sand,
sand, sand, sand,

03:48.367 --> 03:50.066
and, you know, like--

03:50.100 --> 03:52.700
So you gotta be a man right
now because this could rip
you off if you're a [bleep].

03:52.767 --> 03:54.867
-[Anthony chuckles] Right.
-You know, if it
catches a big rock

03:54.867 --> 03:57.166
-it could rip you off--
-[Andy speaking]

03:57.166 --> 03:58.767
-[Anthony laughing]
-Hey, you know what,
shut up.

03:58.767 --> 04:01.166
This isn't the first time I've
done this, I swear to God.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.367
I know, I watched you go
in the water lots of times.

04:03.367 --> 04:05.367
Remember when he
threw the anchor and went
in with the anchor?

04:05.367 --> 04:07.166
-Anchor away.
-[chain rattling]

04:08.400 --> 04:09.567
[Kris] Ahhh!

04:09.567 --> 04:12.667
Seven years ago when they
caught me slipping one time...

04:12.667 --> 04:13.900
-[Anthony laughing]
-...throwing in an anchor.

04:13.967 --> 04:15.867
A smart person
would have let go.

04:15.867 --> 04:17.767
[Kris] It's a patent
pending move.

04:17.767 --> 04:19.100
-Anchor away!
-[ding]

04:19.100 --> 04:19.867
[Kris] Ahhh!

04:22.467 --> 04:23.600
Okay, we're on rock.

04:23.667 --> 04:24.567
[Brad] Drop the anchor.

04:24.567 --> 04:25.767
[Kris] We found some cobble.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.367
We're gonna get
the boat started,

04:27.367 --> 04:29.200
and we're gonna
start making some gold.

04:29.266 --> 04:31.000
And you wanna know
how we're gonna do that?

04:31.066 --> 04:33.467
Because we can see
the [bleep] gold we're mining.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.100
Like, all you have
to do is [bleep] look.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.967
That's the beauty
of a suction dredge.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.600
[motor starting]

04:40.667 --> 04:42.400
[man] Okay, float the hose!

04:43.767 --> 04:47.600
[Kris] <i>I wanna send Andy</i>
<i>down first. I want him</i>
<i>to do the prospecting.</i>

04:47.667 --> 04:50.000
And then when Andy
gets on gold and after he
does his shift,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.200
I'll jump down there
and get the easy gold.

04:52.266 --> 04:53.400
<i>It's all working out great.</i>

04:58.767 --> 05:00.767
Okay. Go, go, go.

05:04.867 --> 05:08.066
[Andy breathing slowly]

05:11.000 --> 05:13.767
-[Kris] <i>Check, check.</i>
-[Andy] Yeah, I got you.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.467
[Kris] <i>Okay, so tell me</i>
<i>when you're on gold.</i>

05:15.467 --> 05:16.400
[Andy] I will.

05:17.867 --> 05:20.000
All right, everything's
going great.

05:20.066 --> 05:21.967
[bleep] It's nice to have
that for a change.

05:22.767 --> 05:24.600
[Andy breathing underwater]

05:24.667 --> 05:27.266
[Kris] Literally, to make
$100 in the Bering Sea,

05:27.266 --> 05:29.367
you just have to drop
your hose for long enough.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.767
It's that easy.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.667
[Andy speaking]

05:42.467 --> 05:44.200
[Andy breathing underwater]

05:44.266 --> 05:46.266
[Andy speaking]

05:47.066 --> 05:48.600
Well, that's [bleep].

05:48.667 --> 05:50.166
[Andy speaking]

05:52.166 --> 05:57.000
Like I said, anchor trolling
is not an exact science.
What can I say?

05:57.066 --> 05:59.600
Maybe punch a couple holes,
see how deep it is.

06:01.367 --> 06:03.367
[Andy speaking]

06:03.900 --> 06:04.667
[Kris] <i>Okay.</i>

06:05.100 --> 06:07.100
[Andy breathing]

06:16.767 --> 06:18.767
[Andy speaking]

06:22.567 --> 06:23.967
[Kris] <i>Is there</i>
<i>any gold in it?</i>

06:26.100 --> 06:27.400
[Andy speaking]

06:27.467 --> 06:30.800
You know, if you want to,
we can go a little bit,

06:30.867 --> 06:36.700
uh, south... south, uh, west,
and I think that's gonna be
a better cobble field.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.667
[Andy speaking]

06:40.800 --> 06:42.100
[Kris] <i>Okay, let's</i>
<i>figure it out.</i>

06:43.200 --> 06:45.100
[Andy breathing]

06:51.467 --> 06:52.400
[Brad speaking]

06:57.667 --> 06:59.000
No, I know. I don't
know what happened.

06:59.066 --> 07:00.467
I don't know why
that didn't work out.

07:10.066 --> 07:12.467
Honestly, sometimes when
you're dragging the anchor,

07:12.467 --> 07:16.667
<i>it can get hooked</i>
<i>on sand patches and it</i>
<i>feels like you're on cobble.</i>

07:17.367 --> 07:18.800
So much for anchor trolling.

07:18.867 --> 07:20.867
What, uh... Where...

07:20.867 --> 07:23.467
[Kris] Let's just, uh, troll
out that way a little bit.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.500
I think we're on cobble.

07:32.567 --> 07:34.567
We're gonna give
it the stick test.

07:34.567 --> 07:37.667
Oh, I'm glad I'm back
to the old-- the old days.

07:37.667 --> 07:41.467
You know, the proven methods
of hitting it with a stick,

07:41.467 --> 07:44.300
useful for thousands
of years by people.

07:45.967 --> 07:46.900
We're on cobble.

07:48.767 --> 07:49.400
There you go.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.000
Okay.

07:55.467 --> 07:57.467
[Andy breathing]

07:59.367 --> 08:00.667
Okay, now we've
established that,

08:00.667 --> 08:02.200
everything is back
to being good.

08:04.166 --> 08:05.100
<i>You on gold yet?</i>

08:07.867 --> 08:09.600
[Andy speaking]

08:16.066 --> 08:20.600
[Kris] <i>I feel like everything</i>
<i>may officially be falling</i>
<i>apart for good.</i>

08:20.667 --> 08:22.400
<i>Who knows when</i>
<i>the</i> Mistress <i>is coming back?</i>

08:22.467 --> 08:25.166
Who knows how we're gonna
make this big payment?

08:25.166 --> 08:28.100
<i>And who knows if</i>
<i>we're ever gonna find gold.</i>

08:28.166 --> 08:31.700
If today's a bust,
I think it's safe to say
the dream is over.

08:32.567 --> 08:33.734
<i>How's it going down there?</i>

08:41.600 --> 08:43.867
[Kris] <i>There is cobble</i>
<i>somewhere around here.</i>

08:44.900 --> 08:46.600

<i>I have to get this skiff</i>

09:03.567 --> 09:07.100

The full moon is just,
like, just stretching

and, like, squeezing it.

09:12.066 --> 09:14.100

09:17.266 --> 09:19.700
Yeah, I don't know.
It's pretty heavy boat.

<i>We're headed into</i>
<i>the homestretch of the season</i>

09:23.867 --> 09:26.266
and I got hit with a total
curveball this morning.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.867
My tender, Steve Riedel, just
announced this morning

09:28.867 --> 09:31.600
that he's quitting,
and he just bailed on me
out of nowhere.

09:31.667 --> 09:35.767
<i>It's really just not efficient</i>
<i>enough to operate</i>
<i>my dredge on my own.</i>

09:35.767 --> 09:38.467
So, this couldn't be
happening at a worse
time during the season.

09:38.467 --> 09:41.767
<i>Everything was fine</i>
<i>with Steve but then, like,</i>
<i>he, like, called me up</i>

09:41.767 --> 09:44.867
yelling in the morning
about how we need
to talk about how

09:45.567 --> 09:48.066
it needs to be more fair.

09:48.066 --> 09:51.166
And like, it's like,
what are you talking about?
It doesn't make any sense.

09:51.166 --> 09:53.266
He says he doesn't
have enough control.

09:53.266 --> 09:55.066
He feels like
it's asymmetrical.

09:55.066 --> 09:56.867
Yeah, for sure
it's asymmetrical.

09:56.867 --> 10:00.367
Like, I spend all my money
and all my time doing this.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.000
<i>I think he should</i>
<i>be paying me.</i>

10:03.066 --> 10:05.367
I might be able
to drag the boat
back out on the water

10:05.367 --> 10:08.200
but I don't think I wanna
dredge without a tender.

10:08.266 --> 10:12.200
I'm gonna have to jack
this up so that it can
slide on the plywood.

10:12.266 --> 10:14.867
<i>I'm shooting for 50 ounces</i>
<i>with my dredge this summer.</i>

10:14.867 --> 10:16.433
<i>So far I've got about 20.</i>

But until I get a tender
on board, I'm not gonna
be able to get any more.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.367
It's a little precarious.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.166
But, it might work.

10:46.800 --> 10:47.567
No.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.567
But, like, Steve,

10:49.567 --> 10:52.200
you had, like, a big, huge,
like, freak out this morning

10:52.266 --> 10:54.400
about how everything
is totally untenable.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.367
And then,

10:56.367 --> 10:59.667
you show up now
like everything's fine.
And it's like...

10:59.667 --> 11:01.567
I don't know what's
going on here.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.467
It sounds like this
isn't, like, the thing
for you to do,

11:04.467 --> 11:05.634
-so...
-It is--

11:12.500 --> 11:15.000
[Zeke] The bow might slide
over pretty easily right now.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.266
-[clattering]
-[Steve] Whoa.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.967
-All right.
-[Steve] That just
worked great.

11:22.967 --> 11:24.667
-[boat running]
-[Zeke] Good to go.

11:24.667 --> 11:25.767
[Zeke] So, yeah,
I don't know--

11:25.767 --> 11:27.400
I don't know what
you want to do, Steve.

11:27.467 --> 11:30.166
I mean, it sounded
on the phone earlier like
you got other things to do.

11:30.166 --> 11:33.100
You'd rather do
other things, and that's fine.
I'll make other arrangements.

11:34.066 --> 11:35.667
-Okay.
-[Zeke] Um...

11:35.667 --> 11:37.600
-[Steve] Enjoy your day
out and...
-Well, thank you.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.166
-Thanks for the help.
-[Steve] Zeke.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.800
<i>Zeke is his own man</i>
<i>and he doesn't like</i>
<i>to share power,</i>

11:46.867 --> 11:50.166
doesn't like to share
responsibility, nothing.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.200
I mean, it's--
He's a one-man show.

11:52.266 --> 11:56.367
And I can deal with that only
so long and then the one-man
show gets really old.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.767
We're just trying
to make things work.

11:57.767 --> 12:00.100
Like, I'm constantly trying
to make things work.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.667
<i>Like, what has he</i>
<i>brought to the table?</i>

12:02.700 --> 12:05.300
Is Steve the best tender?
I mean, not really.

12:05.367 --> 12:06.967
<i>He's not really reliable.</i>

12:06.967 --> 12:09.600
I think it's 'cause he smokes
too much weed in the evening.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.233
I think that's why.

12:11.233 --> 12:14.567
But, he... he knows his
way around the boat and it
was working out for me.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.166
<i>He was a decent fit.</i>

12:16.166 --> 12:18.266
So I need to find
another tender fast,

12:18.266 --> 12:21.800
otherwise the season
is just gonna wind up
in the lost column for me.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.467
<i>Just need better</i>
<i>people around me.</i>

12:28.266 --> 12:31.100
<i>Just wanna go out</i>
<i>and mine some gold.</i>

12:33.000 --> 12:34.400

[Shawn] <i>We've lost a few days,</i>

12:45.767 --> 12:47.900
<i>haven't been able</i>
<i>to get out mining.</i>

12:47.967 --> 12:51.900
We had a spud well
crack out on us.

12:51.967 --> 12:54.166
We've been welding
around the clock.

12:54.166 --> 12:58.000
You gotta get the spud
back in so we can get
back out to mine.

13:09.767 --> 13:13.367
We got everything fired up,
and we gotta go off
to the outer cell,

13:14.667 --> 13:16.100
and drop the spud in.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.600

Equipment problems, weather,
beef with the Kellys...

13:26.667 --> 13:29.266
It's just about pushed
me over the edge.

13:36.467 --> 13:39.900
And Dave, the big boss,
he's coming out to take
a look at the operation.

13:39.967 --> 13:41.033
The pressure's on.

13:42.567 --> 13:47.400
It's starting to get cold

<i>As long as we keep</i>

When you got a behemoth
as big as the <i>Myrtle,</i>
anchors are no good.

14:18.700 --> 14:21.667

<i>60,000 pound spuds.</i>

14:23.000 --> 14:25.266

14:29.567 --> 14:33.567
One of the spuds
cracked the pocket

14:33.567 --> 14:36.300
<i>We got her patched up</i>

14:36.367 --> 14:39.200

14:42.867 --> 14:44.100
It's a pain in the ass.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.367
<i>One step closer.</i>

16:17.367 --> 16:18.667
Yeah!

We got her all put
back together.

16:21.367 --> 16:23.200
She's nice and healthy.

Crane's off.

16:37.367 --> 16:39.166
We're good to go.

of the gold ship,

17:34.667 --> 17:36.867
I feel confident taking
it in and out now.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.200
I'll go away, come back,

17:40.266 --> 17:44.200
there'll be gold in the box
waiting for me. I like that.

17:44.266 --> 17:46.700
Conceivably, there'll
come a point

17:46.767 --> 17:48.367
where I can just call it in

17:48.367 --> 17:51.166
and come into town every
now and then and pick
up my gold and,

17:51.166 --> 17:53.266
head back to the Hawaiian
Islands or Tahiti,

17:53.266 --> 17:54.467
or some damn place.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.367
But, who knows?
I mean, it's so
much fun in Nome.

18:00.367 --> 18:03.467
I mean, what's Tahiti got
that Nome doesn't have?

18:06.066 --> 18:07.900
Well, hula girls,
palm trees...

18:09.266 --> 18:12.767
One thing they don't
have in Tahiti is gold.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.600
<i>Not that I know of anyway.</i>

18:15.667 --> 18:19.467
<i>I was aiming for 300 ounces.</i>
<i>I've got less than 20 so far.</i>

18:19.467 --> 18:22.100
So, maybe putting
the guys in the hot seat

18:22.100 --> 18:23.667
to prove themselves

18:23.667 --> 18:27.266
<i>will finally swing</i>
<i>the pendulum</i>
<i>in our direction,</i>

18:27.266 --> 18:30.800
and we'll have some good
fortune for the rest
of the season.

18:30.867 --> 18:32.233
Season's short.

18:32.233 --> 18:35.367
We need to get as
much gold as we can
in the little time we got.

18:35.367 --> 18:39.100
So, um, tell ya,
for what it's worth.
I'm not gonna be here.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.166
So, you're gonna have
to police yourself

18:41.166 --> 18:42.567
and figure it out
for yourself.

18:42.567 --> 18:44.266

<i>And Gary, he's</i>
<i>my gold gorilla.</i>

18:57.967 --> 18:59.667
He's gonna keep
feeding 'em gold

18:59.667 --> 19:03.800
and he better stay hungry
because the end of the season
is nipping on my ass.

19:03.867 --> 19:07.266
Anyway, that's about all
I got, guys, uh...

19:07.266 --> 19:09.467

to the airport.

And, um, 'cause like,
there's gonna be a lot
of trust involved

21:23.667 --> 21:27.867
and I would want him
to feel like he's safe
under water with me.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.567

that we found, like,
a bunch of big nuggets.

21:32.567 --> 21:35.000
-[man exclaims]
-I was-- But I was,
like, down diving

21:35.000 --> 21:37.300
with a garden hose for some
reason, and I was like--

21:37.367 --> 21:39.567
It was like the garden hose
size suction device.

21:39.567 --> 21:41.367
-[man] Sticking on gold to it?
-And I kept-- Yeah, I know,

21:41.367 --> 21:43.367
it was a little thin
and I kept finding
all these big nuggets,

21:43.367 --> 21:44.667
and sucking 'em up
like... [mimics]

21:55.367 --> 21:57.066
[Jane] And I'm happy
to be of assistance

21:57.066 --> 21:58.600
if you need any help.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.567
<i>I thought I'd get used</i>
<i>to the new diver,</i>

22:00.567 --> 22:03.000
so I'm just kinda
following around right now,

22:03.066 --> 22:05.000
like, forcing myself for him
to, like, get to know me

22:05.000 --> 22:06.400
and, um, think that I'm fun.

22:06.467 --> 22:08.300
Really run right now. [sighs]

22:08.867 --> 22:10.467
Just doing chores.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.800
I'm kinda materialistic
and shallow sometimes,

22:12.867 --> 22:16.567
and I just need to be like...
[stutters] I'm a good person.

22:16.567 --> 22:19.667
So trust me.
[laughing] Hell [bleep] no.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.166
Oh.

22:25.166 --> 22:26.567
Just two or three?

22:29.700 --> 22:31.467
[Jane] Oh, I see.

22:31.467 --> 22:33.967
<i>Yeah, they're setting</i>
<i>three anchors out here.</i>

22:33.967 --> 22:35.667
Well, a skiff's gonna
take one anchor out

22:35.667 --> 22:37.166
<i>and kinda just put it</i>
<i>where they want it.</i>

22:37.667 --> 22:39.400
Jiminy Crickets.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.166
<i>I'm not used to boats</i>
<i>having three anchors</i>

22:41.166 --> 22:43.767
<i>but this dredge is gotta</i>
<i>have it so it can, like,</i>

22:43.767 --> 22:45.500
<i>stay in the place that</i>
<i>we want, which is, like,</i>

22:45.567 --> 22:46.967
<i>hopefully, right on the gold.</i>

22:46.967 --> 22:47.800
Okay, good.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.467
But sometimes I also feel like

22:52.300 --> 22:53.400
there's a soap opera in Nome

22:53.467 --> 22:55.066
and I call it
"As the Anchor Drags".

22:55.166 --> 22:57.166
[instrumental music playing]

23:14.100 --> 23:15.367
[Jane] Total soap opera.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.000
The diver's getting naked.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.800
Well, I mean,
he's changing his clothes.

23:19.867 --> 23:21.467
So I'm giving him his privacy.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.567
His privacy?

23:23.567 --> 23:25.800
Got married women
on this boat.
Can't be looking.

23:27.100 --> 23:27.900
[laughs]

23:33.066 --> 23:34.367
[Emily] Yeah,
we're good to go.

23:34.367 --> 23:35.400
[Jeff speaking]

24:00.867 --> 24:02.667
[Emily] What-- What's
it look like, <i>jefe?</i>

24:02.667 --> 24:03.867
[Jeff speaking]

24:07.867 --> 24:08.867
[Emily] <i>Oh, nice.</i>

24:09.467 --> 24:10.867
[Jeff speaking]

24:13.900 --> 24:15.800
[Emily] <i>All right,</i>
<i>poke away, brother.</i>

24:15.867 --> 24:17.467
[Jane] Oh, boy.

24:17.467 --> 24:20.166
This is a good spot for gold.

24:22.100 --> 24:25.767
Think it's 'cause of me.
I'm like the good luck
charm on the boat.

24:25.767 --> 24:27.767
Really wasn't any gold
until I showed up.

24:29.767 --> 24:31.800
It's true story, puppy.
Just remember that.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.867
[dog whimpering]

24:34.767 --> 24:35.867
[Jeff speaking]

24:36.900 --> 24:39.200
[Emily] Yeah, hopefully,
we'll make money today.

24:40.767 --> 24:42.367
[Jane] <i>Rockin' and rollin'</i>
<i>down there.</i>

24:52.100 --> 24:53.066
[Zeke] What up?

24:53.066 --> 24:55.467
-Hey, brother.
-Hey, glad you made it.

24:55.467 --> 24:57.467
-Yeah.
-Did-- Did they
find your bags?

24:57.467 --> 24:59.100
-Oh, they lost 'em.
It'll be on the next flight.
-Oh, okay.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.567
-All right, run on.
-Yeah, gonna grab those

25:00.567 --> 25:01.867
-bags there.
-[Zeke] Sounds good.

25:01.867 --> 25:04.100
[narrator] <i>After suddenly</i>
<i>losing his tender,</i>

25:04.100 --> 25:05.867
<i>Zeke Tenhoff's hoping</i>
<i>to catch lightning</i>

25:05.867 --> 25:08.367
<i>in a bottle</i>
<i>with a new recruit.</i>

25:08.367 --> 25:10.266
[Zeke] Right on, you made it.

25:10.266 --> 25:12.867
My back is up against the wall
since Steve quit on me,

25:12.867 --> 25:16.467
<i>so I called in a favor</i>
<i>and I'm bringing up</i>
<i>my friend, Nate, to help.</i>

25:16.467 --> 25:19.567
<i>Nate's just a really intense</i>
<i>high energy guy.</i>

25:19.567 --> 25:22.300
<i>He's real tough, he's been</i>
<i>on crab boats a lot.</i>

25:22.367 --> 25:24.767
<i>But most importantly,</i>
<i>he's a certified diver.</i>

25:24.767 --> 25:26.900
But he's never dredged
for gold before.

25:26.967 --> 25:28.567
So hopefully,
he catches on quick.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.266
[Nate speaking]

25:32.567 --> 25:33.400
How was the bungee jump?

25:34.400 --> 25:35.100
Nice.

25:40.300 --> 25:41.200
[Zeke chuckles]

25:41.266 --> 25:42.166
[Nate] So good.

25:45.100 --> 25:46.767
Brush your teeth.

25:46.767 --> 25:48.800
That's a daily reminder
right there, folks.

25:48.867 --> 25:50.700
You only get one set.

25:50.767 --> 25:53.667
I'm definitely flipping
the script getting
Nate on board.

25:53.667 --> 25:56.100
<i>He's got a real</i>
<i>can do positive attitude.</i>

25:56.100 --> 25:58.767
<i>He really wants</i>
<i>to be involved.</i>
<i>Totally different vibe.</i>

25:58.767 --> 26:01.567
[Nate] They don't call me
Nine Finger Nate for nothing.

26:02.166 --> 26:03.667
I'm missing a finger.

26:03.667 --> 26:05.967
The thing about
Nine Fingers Nate
is he's not gonna

26:05.967 --> 26:08.200
bitch and moan about
things like Steve Riedel.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.767
And so hopefully, like,
that good positive attitude

26:10.767 --> 26:13.800
<i>will help us, uh, get</i>
<i>a lot more gold this season.</i>

26:13.867 --> 26:16.667
I need to get some more gold.
I mean, I had...

26:16.667 --> 26:19.500
That cleanup that I just
had was-- I mean,
it was a good cleanup.

26:19.567 --> 26:21.100
<i>I mean, I'll take it, like,</i>

26:21.100 --> 26:23.700
17, almost 18 ounces of gold.

26:23.767 --> 26:26.000
But I know I can do better.

26:26.066 --> 26:29.400
You know, there's--
where I left off there's more
and...

26:30.900 --> 26:33.500
We don't have a whole lot
of, uh, mining days left

26:33.567 --> 26:35.367
so I wanna make
the most of it.

26:35.367 --> 26:37.100
Ready to make some money,
get some gold.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.100
[engine starts]

26:39.900 --> 26:41.700
-Yeah.
-[Nate] Good to go.

26:51.567 --> 26:52.667
[Zeke speaking]

26:56.467 --> 26:57.700
Swing.

27:00.066 --> 27:01.867
[Zeke] <i>I'm going right back</i>
<i>out to the pay streak</i>

27:01.867 --> 27:03.467
<i>that I found last time</i>
<i>I was out.</i>

27:03.467 --> 27:05.867
I don't wanna mess around.
There's only a few days left

27:05.867 --> 27:07.767
and I wanna hit
the good stuff while I can.

27:07.767 --> 27:10.000
<i>And plus, this is gonna</i>
<i>be Nate's first dive.</i>

27:10.066 --> 27:12.567
<i>So I wanna be able</i>
<i>to know that there's</i>
<i>gonna be good gold</i>

27:12.567 --> 27:14.367
for him to see as soon
as he gets down there.

27:16.567 --> 27:17.500
Let her rip!

27:23.867 --> 27:24.767
[breathing under water]

27:36.000 --> 27:37.367
Rock and roll.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.667
How's it looking
down there, Zeke?

27:45.667 --> 27:47.200
<i>How's the visibility?</i>

27:48.166 --> 27:49.367
[Zeke speaking]

27:55.066 --> 27:55.867
Uh...

28:10.500 --> 28:11.667
Uh, hey.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.467
Talk to me, what's going on?

28:20.467 --> 28:21.667
[Zeke speaking]

28:39.767 --> 28:40.800
[Nate speaking]

28:42.266 --> 28:44.166
You know I'm saying?
That scrilla.

28:44.166 --> 28:47.000
Ducats, the moolah.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.767
Frogskins, man,
dead presidents. You know
what I'm talkin' about?

28:50.767 --> 28:51.767
Money!

28:58.667 --> 28:59.867
[narrator] <i>Ten miles east...</i>

29:03.867 --> 29:06.166
So Vern's not here today,
it's just us guys.

29:06.166 --> 29:09.200
So let's be on our game,
let's show we got initiative

29:09.266 --> 29:10.367
and let's get some
gold in the box.

29:10.367 --> 29:11.166
-[Bryan] Let's get some gold.
-Get it.

29:13.667 --> 29:14.867
[Thomas] Release.

29:14.867 --> 29:16.800
[narrator] <i>With the salty</i>
<i>skipper away,</i>

29:16.867 --> 29:19.967
<i>the</i> Wild Ranger <i>crew</i>
<i>is ready to prove their mettle</i>

29:19.967 --> 29:22.467
<i>by piling up precious metal.</i>

29:22.467 --> 29:24.967
-[man] And we're off.
-No turning back.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.400
[Thomas] <i>I hope today</i>
<i>everything goes smooth</i>

29:28.467 --> 29:30.800
<i>and goes as it does</i>
<i>while he's here.</i>

29:30.867 --> 29:33.367
Or even smoother
would be nice.

29:33.367 --> 29:35.700
That's what we're shooting
for, smoother without Vernon.

29:36.667 --> 29:38.100
<i>Let's get this done.</i>

29:38.166 --> 29:40.300
[Gary] <i>This'll be us proving</i>
<i>that, uh, you know,</i>

29:40.367 --> 29:42.967
that we really don't need
him on the boat that much.

29:42.967 --> 29:45.100
<i>I mean, we're--</i>
<i>we're a tight crew</i>

29:45.100 --> 29:47.166
<i>and I think-- I think</i>
<i>we'll do really well.</i>

29:47.166 --> 29:50.000
[Thomas] <i>Yeah, it'll be fun</i>
<i>to go prospect</i>
<i>some different areas.</i>

29:52.100 --> 29:54.000
[Bryan] <i>Vernon always</i>
<i>likes hittin' the same hole,</i>

29:54.066 --> 29:55.867
which is good, I mean,
we know there's gold there,

29:55.867 --> 29:58.467
but we want better gold.
So, um, we're gonna try

29:58.467 --> 30:00.467
some new areas, um,
since Vern's not here.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.100
We'll try
a little bit shallower,

30:02.166 --> 30:04.367
<i>maybe 8 to 12 feet of water</i>

30:04.367 --> 30:06.266
and see if, um,
we can find some cobble.

30:11.367 --> 30:15.100
[Thomas] All right.
You guys wanna
check out this area?

30:15.166 --> 30:16.967
[Gary] Yep,
put that camera down.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.000
How're we looking down there?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.967
-It's sand.
-[Bryan] That's not
what we want.

30:27.967 --> 30:29.166
We don't want sand.

30:29.166 --> 30:30.467
[Gary] We're on sand.

30:33.767 --> 30:37.767
Vern always reminds us
how much he spends
on these cameras.

30:37.767 --> 30:40.467
Let's [bleep] do it.
I don't wanna ruin
that damn camera.

30:40.467 --> 30:42.767
A damn $1,000 camera.

30:42.767 --> 30:45.467
[Thomas] <i>We're using</i>
<i>the camera under motor</i>

30:45.467 --> 30:47.767
<i>and this is, uh,</i>
<i>definitely a big no-no.</i>

30:47.767 --> 30:50.367
Just because of risk
of sucking it up
into our prop.

30:50.367 --> 30:52.200
[Vernon] Y'all didn't tell me
you put the camera down.

30:52.266 --> 30:53.767
I'm up here [bleep] with
this business.

30:53.767 --> 30:55.467
I don't wanna run that camera

30:55.467 --> 30:57.367
through the propeller
like we've done before.

30:57.367 --> 30:59.000
[Thomas] <i>And it's definitely</i>
<i>going a lot quicker</i>

30:59.000 --> 31:00.467
<i>than when Vern's on board.</i>

31:00.467 --> 31:03.000
Having to anchor up
and, you know,

31:03.000 --> 31:04.667
just bring everything
to a dead stop

31:04.667 --> 31:05.867
just so we could
drop the camera.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.266
-So we're on the cobble--
-This is working great so far.

31:11.266 --> 31:13.500
-[Gary] There's some cobble.
-This is, uh, we're going
a lot faster.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.900
I mean, we just covered
300 feet of ground already.

31:15.967 --> 31:18.500
We're on cobble and sand,
now I just seen the cobble
go by.

31:18.567 --> 31:20.100
We're on cobble sand.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.700
Nothing's wrapped up
in the propeller.

31:22.767 --> 31:24.166
[Gary] Oh, man,
this is looking good, though.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.200
I mean, we're making a map

31:29.200 --> 31:31.500
so it's gonna take
a little time
but once we do this,

31:31.567 --> 31:33.467
bang, we'll know...
We'll be going here

31:33.467 --> 31:34.800
all the time where
all of our patches are.

31:34.867 --> 31:37.000
All right, let's drop
our rear anchor.

31:37.066 --> 31:37.867
[Gary] All right.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.467
Guys, ready?

31:42.467 --> 31:43.800
You're, uh, pretty close
to be ready?

31:43.867 --> 31:45.567
-You wanna set the box?
-[Gary] I'm ready.

31:46.166 --> 31:46.800
[Bryan] Yep.

31:56.000 --> 31:56.767
[Gary] Okay.

32:08.100 --> 32:09.000
Coming down.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.166
[breathing under water]

32:20.600 --> 32:22.100
[vocalizing]

32:23.367 --> 32:24.100
[exclaims]

32:25.467 --> 32:27.166
How's your water temp, good?

32:27.166 --> 32:29.100
[Gary on radio] <i>Uh,</i>
<i>yeah, feels good so far.</i>

32:30.100 --> 32:31.233
All right.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.900
[Gary] All right. Let's take
a look around down here.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.667
[Bryan] How's the material
looking? Pretty good?

32:43.400 --> 32:45.867
[Gary] Yeah, it looks pretty
damn good from what
I'm looking at.

32:45.867 --> 32:48.467
-Awesome, let's get
some gold, buddy.
-[Gary on radio] <i>Sure.</i>

32:49.700 --> 32:52.266
How does it feel, you guys,
not having Vernon on the boat?

32:54.266 --> 32:56.900
It's a little more quieter,
that's for sure.

32:56.967 --> 32:58.300
So don't [bleep] around.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.300
[shouting] Hey,
you wanna fight, [bleep]?

33:00.367 --> 33:03.100
What do you mean,
I don't know what
I'm [bleep] doing?

33:03.100 --> 33:05.867
[Gary on radio]
<i>It's definitely more quieter.</i>

33:05.867 --> 33:08.867
[Bryan] <i>Do you think it's</i>
<i>a good way to find ground</i>
<i>from now on,</i>

33:08.867 --> 33:12.100
<i>um, you know,</i>
<i>put the camera down</i>
<i>with the boat moving?</i>

33:12.867 --> 33:14.333
[Gary] Oh, yeah.

33:16.100 --> 33:18.667
-Yeah, I think it saved
a lot of time.
-[Gary on radio] <i>Yeah.</i>

33:18.667 --> 33:20.867
[Bryan] Yeah, so far so good.
We got a guy down dredging.

33:20.867 --> 33:22.300
That's all that counts,

33:22.367 --> 33:25.000
you know, the dredge box is
going so we're getting
gold nuggets.

33:25.767 --> 33:27.000
Everything's working,
but like,

33:27.000 --> 33:28.767
you see all these lines,
you know we...

33:28.767 --> 33:31.400
Vernon'd be yelling
about all those lines
on the floor. [laughs]

33:31.467 --> 33:33.100
[Vernon] Pick that [bleep].

33:33.100 --> 33:36.567
Damn it. These cords on deck
are my pet peeve.

33:36.567 --> 33:39.166
It's a fire hazard.
You damage these cords,

33:39.166 --> 33:41.100
next thing you know,
they're sparking off.

33:41.166 --> 33:43.266
[bleep] burn you to death
in the middle of the night.

33:43.266 --> 33:45.166
[Bryan] But, uh,
everyone's safe

33:45.166 --> 33:47.000
and, uh, good day so far.

33:47.000 --> 33:47.767

34:08.467 --> 34:09.900

34:09.967 --> 34:12.367
I gotta watch out,
the boss is here now.

34:12.367 --> 34:14.900

his ass to work.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.967
Gotta do a little better
than that, Shawn.

34:55.967 --> 34:58.367

I'm hoping they're
not too deep.

Hope I can just keep
this in digging.

36:27.667 --> 36:31.500
I have a feeling, gonna give
out a good bounty this time.

Nice to see it

Everyday we're putting gold
in the box is a good day.

37:05.066 --> 37:07.200
This is some
good-looking dirt.

37:07.266 --> 37:10.900
Now we just gotta keep
this beast running

37:53.166 --> 37:54.467
He's in a pissed off mood

37:54.467 --> 37:55.800
which usually tells me

37:55.867 --> 37:57.367
that he's not seeing [bleep].

37:57.367 --> 37:59.400
You know, I know
we're crazy people.

37:59.467 --> 38:01.166
So we, uh, we're not
in good moods

38:01.166 --> 38:02.667

38:02.667 --> 38:04.800

he's going down
to put us on gold.

38:52.567 --> 38:54.767
Just like the good old days.

38:54.767 --> 38:58.100
It'd be pretty sweet
if I go down there
and save my season.

39:00.266 --> 39:01.667
That would be a baller move.

39:07.467 --> 39:10.200
All right, we just got Kris
down, I think he's on cobble.

39:10.266 --> 39:12.867

a nice gold-packed area.

back this way.

41:08.667 --> 41:09.767
All right, he says
that all the time,

two [bleep] about
what's going on.

41:48.000 --> 41:48.934
We were on gold.

41:48.934 --> 41:52.700
But we have to stay there
to make it work.

What's your problem?

[Brad speaking]

42:00.066 --> 42:01.467
Set this anchor.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.567
And then back up
until this anchor's tight.

<i>again.</i>

to screw it up.

our clamp got old
and slipped off.

46:07.567 --> 46:09.867
If we don't have one on board,

46:09.867 --> 46:12.100
we're gonna have to cut
this day short.

46:12.166 --> 46:13.467
Yeah, I wouldn't reuse this.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.100
Yeah, clamps rust out
here in the salt water,

46:17.100 --> 46:18.800
they just get chewed up
real fast.

We got a clamp, luckily.

to see it. [laughs]

47:03.867 --> 47:05.367

[Zeke] But...

47:55.467 --> 47:59.000

48:03.467 --> 48:04.467
Roger that.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.266
[Zeke] <i>So, if you--</i>

48:12.266 --> 48:13.667
[Zeke continues speaking]

48:14.867 --> 48:16.100
Oh, big time.

48:16.166 --> 48:18.567
[Zeke speaking]

48:20.667 --> 48:22.266
All right, roger that.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.300
Really pumped.

48:28.367 --> 48:31.066
So I'mma get down there,
get the gold,

48:31.066 --> 48:32.867
hopefully get the cheddar.

48:32.867 --> 48:34.300
Get the bread,
you know what I'm saying?

48:34.967 --> 48:37.000
There he is, he's up.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.300
[Zeke] This is really
challenging ground

48:38.367 --> 48:40.600
for Nate's first
Bering Sea dive.

48:40.667 --> 48:42.967
<i>I'm already pretty wiped</i>
<i>from moving all those rocks.</i>

48:42.967 --> 48:45.800
<i>So this'll be good opportunity</i>
<i>to see if he can really</i>

48:45.867 --> 48:47.367
you know,
not just talk the talk,

48:47.367 --> 48:49.467
but like, walk the walk.

48:49.467 --> 48:51.800
I'm [bleep] pumped, baby!
Let's get some gold!

48:53.100 --> 48:55.300
[Zeke] The clock's ticking
on the rest of the summer.

48:55.367 --> 48:57.700
I need Nate to be
a difference-maker.

48:57.767 --> 49:00.867
-[motor whirring]
-Get my little tootsies
warmed up.

49:00.867 --> 49:03.667
See normally,
I just gotta pee in it
to get warm.

49:03.667 --> 49:04.967
[Zeke] Nate's a big guy.

49:04.967 --> 49:07.367
He's like
a crab-fisherman guy.

49:07.367 --> 49:10.000
<i>He's done a bunch</i>
<i>of diving before.</i>

49:10.000 --> 49:13.166
<i>But you never really know</i>
<i>who's gonna like, run with it.</i>

49:26.166 --> 49:28.100
How goes it down there?
You at the bottom?

49:29.000 --> 49:29.967
[Nate speaking]

49:37.066 --> 49:38.500
Yeah, just look around
all over there.

49:38.567 --> 49:40.800
There's a bunch of gold
all through there
that I didn't get yet.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.467
[Zeke speaking]

49:56.100 --> 49:57.867

You seeing some gold there?

50:06.467 --> 50:08.266
[Nate speaking]

50:22.266 --> 50:23.567
Yeah, it's extremely obvious.

50:23.567 --> 50:24.667

[Kris speaking]

50:51.300 --> 50:53.467
[narrator] <i>On Kris's</i>
<i>first dive of the season,</i>

50:53.467 --> 50:57.100
<i>the captain has swung fortune</i>
<i>toward the Kellys.</i>

50:57.166 --> 51:00.700
[Andy] It feels good
to actually see the gold
that you suck up, huh?

51:00.767 --> 51:04.667
[Kris speaking]

51:04.667 --> 51:07.900
[Andy] <i>Me too.</i>
<i>Like right now,</i>
<i>I have to trust you.</i>

51:07.967 --> 51:09.767
That [bleep]
better be on gold.

51:11.467 --> 51:14.200
[Kris speaking]

51:20.700 --> 51:22.600
It was a rough start
in the beginning.

51:22.667 --> 51:25.367
But we--
we finally relocated
our anchors

51:25.367 --> 51:27.867
and we're on the spot,
we've got a GPS.

51:29.166 --> 51:30.467
Everything's good right now.

51:33.166 --> 51:35.667
<i>He wishes he could bring</i>
<i>his excavator over here</i>

51:35.667 --> 51:38.667
<i>and dig this easy hole</i>
<i>10 feet deep.</i>

51:38.667 --> 51:40.967
<i>We're making money now</i>
<i>with this load.</i>

51:40.967 --> 51:43.800
But the <i>Mistress</i> seems to be
a non-profit organization.

51:43.867 --> 51:44.600
[laughs] You know
what I mean?

51:44.667 --> 51:46.000
You just put money into it.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.367
They don't get money
out of it.

51:47.367 --> 51:49.367
[laughs]

51:51.867 --> 51:54.100
[Brad] <i>Okay, Kris, you've been</i>
<i>down for four hours now.</i>

51:54.100 --> 51:55.367
<i>You ready to come up?</i>

51:55.367 --> 51:57.567
Yes, I think I'm ready
to come up.

51:58.667 --> 52:00.367
[Kris speaking]

52:00.367 --> 52:02.266
Okay, I'll have him
get suited up right now.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.100
Here he comes.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.000
So I did it.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.600
I finally accomplished
our mission.

52:09.667 --> 52:12.600
As leader
of the Reaper Nation,
I got us on gold.

52:12.667 --> 52:14.066
Now the next step.

52:14.066 --> 52:15.500
What is up?
Let's go get some gold.

52:16.767 --> 52:18.900
Train Anthony
so we can get
a solid dive team

52:18.967 --> 52:20.867
going on the <i>Reaper</i>
at all times.

52:20.867 --> 52:21.834
We need this

52:21.867 --> 52:23.400
if we have any chance
of hitting our goal

52:23.467 --> 52:24.767
before the summer ends.

52:24.767 --> 52:27.867
I didn't really explain
the trudging at all
to Anthony.

52:27.867 --> 52:30.300
So we're just gonna throw
Anthony underneath the water,

52:30.367 --> 52:32.367
give him a little
trial by fire.

52:32.367 --> 52:33.266
But I'm gonna tell you,

52:33.266 --> 52:34.967
I know
he's gonna make it work.

52:34.967 --> 52:38.100
Because the nozzle is sitting
six inches from gold.

52:38.166 --> 52:40.100
All he has to do
is move the [bleep]
thing around

52:40.166 --> 52:41.767
and he's gonna get gold.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.867
[Kris] <i>Anthony is</i>
<i>an underwater welder.</i>

52:44.867 --> 52:46.867
That's a pretty serious gig.

52:46.867 --> 52:48.900
It's a lot simpler
than it looks.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.500
It really is.

52:50.567 --> 52:52.166
I have a lot of faith in you.

52:52.166 --> 52:54.367
-Gotcha.
-I really do.

52:54.367 --> 52:56.367
But he's never dredged
for gold anywhere,

52:56.367 --> 52:57.567
let alone the Bering Sea.

52:59.800 --> 53:01.667
Hopefully,
it doesn't overwhelm him.

53:01.667 --> 53:03.200
[motor whirring]

53:03.266 --> 53:04.900
[Kris] You're good.
Yeah, you're good.

53:04.967 --> 53:05.900
Go.

53:10.266 --> 53:13.266
Sometimes, you know,
you need that push.

53:13.266 --> 53:15.367
You know?
'Cause you're thinking
about it too much.

53:15.367 --> 53:17.967
I knew he was thinking
about it too much.

53:24.166 --> 53:26.266
[Anthony speaking]

53:26.266 --> 53:28.066
[Kris] <i>Okay, now,</i>
<i>there's two ways</i>
<i>you can do this.</i>

53:28.066 --> 53:30.066
<i>You can either</i>
<i>be on your knees</i>
<i>and suck it up</i>

53:30.066 --> 53:32.266
<i>or you can stand up there</i>
<i>like a vacuum cleaner.</i>

53:34.066 --> 53:34.867
[Anthony speaking]

53:39.100 --> 53:40.367
He's just getting
his feel for it.

53:40.367 --> 53:41.767
But it's like,
right off the bat,

53:41.767 --> 53:43.500
he goes down there,
he takes the hose off,

53:43.567 --> 53:44.500
he goes right to work.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.166
[Kris] <i>Do you see</i>
<i>any gold yet?</i>

53:51.100 --> 53:52.066
[Anthony speaking]

53:53.767 --> 53:54.800
[Kris speaking]

53:59.266 --> 53:59.900
[Anthony speaking]

54:01.767 --> 54:03.667
[Kris speaking]

54:03.667 --> 54:04.433
[Anthony speaking]

54:06.000 --> 54:07.567
And when you see
black [bleep]

54:07.567 --> 54:09.667
that's where the gold hides.

54:09.667 --> 54:11.867
So make sure you vacuum that
a little harder.

54:11.867 --> 54:13.066
[Anthony] <i>Roger.</i>

54:13.066 --> 54:14.100
Okay. There you go.

54:17.700 --> 54:19.100
He's not much of a talker.

54:19.166 --> 54:21.166
To be honest with you,
he's got that Southern drawl.

54:21.166 --> 54:24.066
I can only understand
what the [bleep]
he says half the time anyway,

54:24.066 --> 54:25.000
so we're cool.

54:34.967 --> 54:35.900
What's the matter?

54:41.266 --> 54:43.667
[man speaking]

54:45.166 --> 54:46.867
[Kris] Okay,
stop for a second.

54:46.867 --> 54:49.166
And uh,
clip the nozzle on its side.

54:51.300 --> 54:52.233
[Anthony] Okay.

54:53.700 --> 54:55.800
Stick your hand
kind of in front of it.

54:55.867 --> 54:58.000
Do you feel a lot
of suction going on?

55:01.300 --> 55:02.266
[Anthony] Uh...

55:02.767 --> 55:03.667
[Anthony speaking]

55:04.367 --> 55:06.100
[Kris speaking]

55:07.367 --> 55:08.166
[Anthony speaking]

55:08.166 --> 55:09.300
[bleep] Man.

55:10.767 --> 55:12.667
It's not going good
our first time.

55:14.600 --> 55:15.900
[Kris] <i>Here's the thing</i>
<i>about dredging.</i>

55:15.967 --> 55:17.967
<i>In theory,</i>
<i>it sounds easy.</i>

55:17.967 --> 55:20.767
<i>Big giant vacuum cleaner</i>
<i>suck up free money.</i>

55:20.767 --> 55:22.166
But it's way harder
than it looks.

55:22.166 --> 55:23.800
And I should've gave him
more of a tutorial

55:23.867 --> 55:26.400
before just throwing him
down there.

55:26.467 --> 55:29.200
<i>Now he's stuck on a rock jam</i>
<i>and it sound like a nasty one.</i>

55:32.667 --> 55:34.700
Okay, man,
just hook it up
and we're done.

55:34.767 --> 55:36.266
I'm gonna take you
back to the harbor

55:36.266 --> 55:38.867
and I'll give you
a full demonstration
on what we're doing.

55:39.667 --> 55:41.567
[Anthony speaking]

55:41.567 --> 55:43.266
I'm not pissed,
don't worry about it.

55:43.266 --> 55:44.500
You did a good job.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.800
[Anthony speaking]

55:53.767 --> 55:54.734
So we're gonna pack up.

55:54.734 --> 55:57.000
But we'll clean the rock jam
out on shore.

55:58.600 --> 55:59.467

[Kris speaking]

56:16.567 --> 56:17.367
[Anthony speaking]

56:22.767 --> 56:24.700
I should've stayed
down there myself.

56:31.367 --> 56:32.667
[Kris] Could be better.
[clears throat]

56:33.967 --> 56:36.266
It couldn't have gone
any worse with Anthony.

56:36.266 --> 56:37.667
Oh, yeah, I guess
it could've.

56:37.667 --> 56:39.166
He could've freaked out.

56:39.166 --> 56:41.567
He could've tried [bleep]
drowning himself.

56:41.567 --> 56:43.000
Did you hear his breathing
when he hit that water?

56:43.000 --> 56:44.400
[breathing heavily]

56:44.467 --> 56:46.667
-You're spitting all over me.
-I know I was.

56:46.667 --> 56:48.500
Imagine him
spitting in my mask.

56:48.567 --> 56:50.266
You'll be fine.

56:51.200 --> 56:54.000
[Kris] <i>As the captain,</i>
<i>I need people to have</i>

56:54.066 --> 56:55.567

Otherwise,
he'll never succeed and--

57:00.967 --> 57:02.467
We won't have
the crew we need.

57:02.467 --> 57:04.900
I really want him
to become a vital team player

57:04.967 --> 57:05.934
for <i>Reaper</i> mining.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.300
[Kris] Don't worry, my friend.
I love you.

57:10.367 --> 57:12.300
And it's gonna take
a hell of a lot of problems

57:12.367 --> 57:14.100
for me to stop loving you.

57:14.100 --> 57:15.800
You never have to worry
about that.

57:15.867 --> 57:17.100
Hey, let me tell you what.

[Anthony speaking]

57:18.667 --> 57:21.367
You made it into my place
in my life

57:21.367 --> 57:22.767
that is really hard
to get out of.

57:22.767 --> 57:25.767
I now consider you
one of my good friends.

at least an ounce an hour,
ounce and a half.

58:30.467 --> 58:31.734
Whoo!

58:31.734 --> 58:34.200
[narrator] <i>And the crew</i>
<i>is firing on all cylinders.</i>

58:34.266 --> 58:35.367
[Emily] Good to have a team

58:35.367 --> 58:37.767
that knows how to find
and follow and produce gold.

58:37.767 --> 58:39.367
[Jeff] Oh, there we go.
Perfect.

58:40.767 --> 58:43.967
I mean, I can see some gold
right on top of this stuff.

58:51.467 --> 58:53.467
[Emily] It's getting
a bit choppy.

58:53.467 --> 58:54.166
Copy?

58:55.200 --> 58:57.467
[Jeff speaking]

58:57.467 --> 58:58.166
[Emily] Roger.

58:58.767 --> 59:01.266
[groaning]

59:02.367 --> 59:03.967
[Jeff speaking]

59:10.667 --> 59:12.266
[Emily] Yeah, dude,
this sucks.

59:13.767 --> 59:16.166
[Emily] <i>We're at the point</i>
<i>in the season</i>
<i>where it's make or break.</i>

59:16.166 --> 59:17.867
But you don't wanna push it
too hard.

59:17.867 --> 59:20.166
There's still a line
that you can't cross.

59:20.166 --> 59:21.600
[Emily speaking]

59:23.467 --> 59:24.867
[Jeff] Ah, [bleep].

59:28.867 --> 59:30.800
[Emily] <i>We still have</i>
<i>a couple more days</i>
<i>to mine but,</i>

59:30.867 --> 59:33.567
we can't damage the rig
or get people hurt.

59:35.266 --> 59:35.934
[Emily] Oh!

59:37.100 --> 59:38.166
We gotta get out
of here.

59:38.166 --> 59:39.867
This weather's
not goofing around.

59:39.867 --> 59:40.767
The weather's changed,

59:40.767 --> 59:42.767
the diver's been down
long enough but,

59:42.767 --> 59:44.200
we're gonna put
a marker buoy down,

59:44.266 --> 59:46.400
so when we come back,
we're gonna start
right back here.

59:46.467 --> 59:48.500
They were like,
"It's called a marker buoy."

59:48.567 --> 59:50.100
So basically,
the diver just comes up

59:50.100 --> 59:53.266
and grabs the anchor
and takes it down to his spot.

59:53.266 --> 59:55.567
And the buoy lets us know
up top where it's at.

59:56.000 --> 59:56.767
Hey, Jane.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.266
You wanna pull up
his umbilical?

1:00:00.567 --> 1:00:01.900
[Jane] Yep, we gotcha.

1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:11.166
[Emily] You getting dragged
around down there, huh?

1:00:11.166 --> 1:00:12.266
Cold, yeah.

1:00:12.266 --> 1:00:14.000
-[Emily speaking]
-[Jeff] Yeah?

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:15.767
[Emily] Yeah,
just 'cause, you know,
I don't like the fact

1:00:15.767 --> 1:00:18.600
that this-- this kind of,
south wind is coming up
a little bit.

1:00:18.667 --> 1:00:19.667
[Jeff] Right.

1:00:19.667 --> 1:00:20.967
I mean, all in all,
there's gold in the box.

1:00:20.967 --> 1:00:22.500
I think it was a great day.

1:00:22.567 --> 1:00:24.400
-[Emily speaking]
-[Jeff] Yeah.

1:00:24.467 --> 1:00:25.867
Yeah.

1:00:25.867 --> 1:00:28.700
[Emily] It sucks
that Jeff's dive was cut short
due to weather.

1:00:28.767 --> 1:00:31.400
<i>But he's already killing it</i>
<i>and I'm so glad he's here.</i>

1:00:32.567 --> 1:00:34.166
This is [bleep] heavy.
Oh, [bleep].

1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:38.000
[Jane] Is it too heavy?

1:00:38.066 --> 1:00:41.467
Jane's stepping up
to the plate in her own,
unique Jane way.

1:00:41.467 --> 1:00:43.867
She's coming in to the job
really well.

1:00:43.867 --> 1:00:46.800
The team's coming together
and we're on
amazing gold still.

1:00:46.867 --> 1:00:49.400
Um, we'll just have to see
what comes out of the box.

1:00:50.667 --> 1:00:52.767
[Jeff] Yeah, I think
it's a great first dive.

1:00:52.767 --> 1:00:55.266
Um, four hours on gold.

1:00:55.266 --> 1:00:57.000
This is the kind of ground
you wanna see.

1:00:58.066 --> 1:00:59.467
Tomorrow's a new day and

1:00:59.467 --> 1:01:01.700
we know where
the gold's at, so.

1:01:01.767 --> 1:01:04.567
Come back out
and get another six hours in.

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.266
-[Emily] There you go.
-[Jeff] All right.

1:01:07.266 --> 1:01:08.467
[Emily] Atta boy.

1:01:08.467 --> 1:01:10.367
I'm driving it
straight to Nordstrom's.

1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:12.166
[Jeff] Yes!

1:01:12.166 --> 1:01:13.767
-[Emily laughs]
-[Jeff speaking]

1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:17.667
I need just the one.

1:01:17.667 --> 1:01:19.567
-[Jeff] Yeah? Which ones?
-[laughs]

1:01:19.567 --> 1:01:21.500
-Actually-- actually...
-[Emily] A jeans?

1:01:21.567 --> 1:01:23.000
I was just saying
I think, like...

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.467

-[Jeff] Should not?

1:01:27.266 --> 1:01:29.100
[Jeff speaking]

1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:31.266
It's like, heterosexual.
Like, just--

1:01:31.266 --> 1:01:32.567
[Jane speaking]

1:01:35.667 --> 1:01:37.367
-[Jeff] You would say what?
-I would think less of you.

1:01:37.367 --> 1:01:39.667
But me wearing AG jeans
is yes.

1:01:41.900 --> 1:01:42.900
I like Sevens.

1:01:42.967 --> 1:01:44.800

1:01:45.867 --> 1:01:47.467

1:01:48.467 --> 1:01:49.400

what the rest of the season
is gonna bring us

my brother's got a boat
in the water, like,

1:03:27.166 --> 1:03:30.000
there's plenty of opportunity
if the weather will allow it.

1:03:35.266 --> 1:03:37.100
-Yeah, baby.
-[Zeke] Yeah.

1:03:37.100 --> 1:03:38.900
-Whoo!
-[Zeke] Right on,
that was fun.

1:03:38.967 --> 1:03:41.266
-That was awesome.
-[Zeke] Saw some gold.

1:03:41.266 --> 1:03:43.100
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

1:03:43.166 --> 1:03:45.767
You don't realize
how tired you are
until you come up,

1:03:45.767 --> 1:03:49.300
because you're so in the zone.

1:03:49.367 --> 1:03:52.467

it's like [bleep]
just picking up money.

1:03:52.467 --> 1:03:53.867
-You know, like, money,

-[Zeke] Yeah.

1:03:53.867 --> 1:03:55.200
...and you're like...

1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:58.066
-It's so engaging.
-[Zeke] That's what
I'm saying. [chuckles]

1:03:58.066 --> 1:03:59.500
That's the coolest job ever.

1:03:59.567 --> 1:04:01.800

been able to do anything else.

I don't really know
if you can do anything else
after doing that.

1:04:07.166 --> 1:04:09.867
There's no other job
where you're just
picking up money.

1:04:09.867 --> 1:04:12.300
Yeah, no.
It makes me really happy
that you enjoyed it.

1:04:12.367 --> 1:04:14.300

How as it?

1:04:18.567 --> 1:04:21.567
[burbling] It's [bleep]
amazing.

a little too much.

[Zeke] Well, that's...
that's okay.

1:04:28.867 --> 1:04:30.467
There's plenty
of gold out here.

1:04:30.467 --> 1:04:31.867
There's probably, like...

1:04:31.867 --> 1:04:33.900
Somebody... There was
an estimation that there was

1:04:33.967 --> 1:04:37.567
three quarters
of a billion ounces
in between these two capes.

1:04:37.567 --> 1:04:40.100
Well, butter my buns
and call me a biscuit.

1:04:40.867 --> 1:04:41.967
-[Zeke] You got it.
-Whoo!

1:04:43.367 --> 1:04:46.967

Oh, let me have
a Jameson's, please,
on the rocks.

1:04:56.367 --> 1:04:59.166

but people are very interested

1:04:59.166 --> 1:05:03.467

this socialize thing.

<i>another episode</i>
<i>of Social Hour with Vernon.</i>

1:05:09.100 --> 1:05:15.000
Every now and then, um,
I do like a little sip
of Jameson's.

1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:18.800
It sort of, uh, soothes
the troubled brow.

1:05:18.867 --> 1:05:22.467
Uh, it puts me
in a more mellow mode.

1:05:22.467 --> 1:05:25.467
Back in the old days,
I used to like Tanqueray gin,

1:05:25.467 --> 1:05:27.500
because I found out
if I drank Tanqueray,

1:05:27.567 --> 1:05:31.000
I didn't get into any
fights most...
most of the time.

1:05:31.066 --> 1:05:33.066
[man 1] Go ahead, come on.
Come on.

1:05:33.066 --> 1:05:34.900

whoa, whoa!

a civilized drink here.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.000
[Irish bagpipes playing]

1:05:40.066 --> 1:05:42.767
If you read Campbell's books
on mysticism,

1:05:42.767 --> 1:05:45.500
he said that Jameson's
was spiritual,

1:05:45.567 --> 1:05:50.400
and people would ask him
what he did to get
into that spiritual realm,

1:05:50.467 --> 1:05:52.700
and his answer was
he drink Jameson's.

1:05:52.767 --> 1:05:54.000
And that's why I drink it.

1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.100
You read the label on it,
<i>"Sine Metu."</i>

1:05:57.166 --> 1:05:59.767
And it translates
to the spirit of life.

1:05:59.767 --> 1:06:00.767

more spiritual already.

or six ounces in there.

with my six inch dredge,

out there,

1:07:29.166 --> 1:07:30.367

and a really, only,
just slightly better winter,

it feels really good
to get back into the gold

1:07:38.567 --> 1:07:40.166

into the groove.

1:07:40.166 --> 1:07:42.967

-[Emily] Oh, it's right there.
Sorry.

-[Jane] Ripples?

-[Jeff] Riffles.
-[Jane] Riffles.

1:08:24.867 --> 1:08:25.900
Oh, yeah.

1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:29.100

an awesome team going on here,

uh, for the summer
and maybe beyond.

1:08:41.567 --> 1:08:43.767

my fingers for a big number.

-[man] That's awesome.

It's all shaping up to be
everything I hoped for.

-[Emily] Yeah.

-[Emily] Yeah.
Nice having you around, Jane.
-[Jane] Wow.

1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:54.300
[Emily] You're bringing
us gold. Gold luck.

1:09:54.367 --> 1:09:56.900
[Jane] Who's to say
I won't ditch my family,

There's some boulders.

1:11:03.066 --> 1:11:04.266
Really looking good.

1:11:06.100 --> 1:11:08.367
Been a tough year,
we've been struggling

1:11:08.367 --> 1:11:13.400
with little gremlin

a bunch of time and money,

1:11:13.467 --> 1:11:19.467

'em all worked out now.

The night crew is here
right now.

1:12:03.467 --> 1:12:06.800
Yeah, hopefully
the night shift goes as smooth
as day shift,

1:12:06.867 --> 1:12:11.800
and we can, uh, be happy,
and pay all the bills,

1:12:11.867 --> 1:12:13.767
and maybe get some
of my money back.

1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:15.867
Steady as she goes.

1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:24.266
Well, you can see it in there.

1:12:24.266 --> 1:12:27.800
Yup, we just might put some
gold in the box.

1:12:27.867 --> 1:12:30.667
Night sift here,
getting everything greased.

1:12:30.667 --> 1:12:33.266

1:12:35.900 --> 1:12:37.166
Brr!

1:12:37.967 --> 1:12:42.166
Successful trip.
Feels good to put
some gold in the box.

four hours.

<i>in the box,</i>
<i>we got some time on.</i>

1:13:40.266 --> 1:13:43.867
I'm working the systems
like I would with Vernon here,

1:13:43.867 --> 1:13:45.700

<i>our divers got out.</i>

1:13:52.767 --> 1:13:54.600
<i>Today was a successful day</i>
<i>in my book.</i>

1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:56.367
[Cary speaking]

1:14:00.767 --> 1:14:02.567
[Thomas] Let's go home,
get some sleep.

1:14:02.567 --> 1:14:04.567
Hey, today was
a good day, guys. Good job!

1:14:15.500 --> 1:14:19.867
I think the idea
of using divining rods
is really interesting.

1:14:19.867 --> 1:14:22.166
It's an ancient method
to find gold.

1:14:23.300 --> 1:14:26.266
<i>Anything that science</i>
<i>can't explain</i>

1:14:26.266 --> 1:14:27.667
we've really
just called magic,

1:14:27.667 --> 1:14:31.000
but there's
a lot of things in the world
that we consider magic

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.567
that really are just things
we haven't been able
to explain.

1:14:35.667 --> 1:14:42.066
Magic is... it's something
that's operating regardless
of one's belief.

1:14:42.066 --> 1:14:45.600
So, in some, maybe,
quantum idea,

1:14:45.667 --> 1:14:49.000
uh, it's very possible
that there's some kind of

1:14:49.066 --> 1:14:54.867
intrinsic connection
between us and, uh,
the surrounding natural world.

1:14:54.867 --> 1:14:57.867
<i>It's kind of like</i>
<i>the placebo effect,</i>
<i>you know, uh.</i>

1:14:57.867 --> 1:15:02.667
<i>Does the placebo effect...</i>
<i>how exactly does it work?</i>

1:15:02.667 --> 1:15:04.867
In some kind of way,
there's the law of attraction.

1:15:04.867 --> 1:15:08.166
So, I think that, uh,
a big principle

1:15:08.166 --> 1:15:11.467
in the idea of, uh, you know,
dousing for gold,

1:15:11.467 --> 1:15:14.767
is, uh, this idea
that the law of attraction

1:15:14.767 --> 1:15:18.000
is this, sort of,
quantum field

1:15:18.066 --> 1:15:20.100
that we don't
fully understand.

1:15:20.100 --> 1:15:24.100
<i>Even the top</i>
<i>quantum physicists</i>
<i>still don't fully understand</i>

1:15:24.166 --> 1:15:26.800
<i>some of the nuances</i>
<i>of how the universe works.</i>

1:15:26.867 --> 1:15:29.734
So, it's cool to think
about the possibilities

1:15:29.734 --> 1:15:33.567
and the law of attraction
with gold is strong as
it ever was, you know.

1:15:49.667 --> 1:15:51.066
[Bryan] All right, all right.

1:15:52.266 --> 1:15:53.600
That's what I'm talking about.

1:15:55.734 --> 1:15:57.300
There, there, there it is.

1:15:58.667 --> 1:15:59.967
Oh, there's lots of gold
there already.

1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:04.400
I'm glad Bryan likes
to clean gold.

1:16:04.467 --> 1:16:07.066
[chuckles] <i>Because it's not</i>
<i>my favorite thing to do.</i>

1:16:07.066 --> 1:16:10.400

for that long,
I can't get unbent.

-You done?
-All right, let's see
what we got.

somewhat impressed.

1:16:24.266 --> 1:16:26.967
-[Bryan] Not bad, huh?
-I mean, you guys weren't
pulling your pud

1:16:26.967 --> 1:16:28.467
-for all that time.
-[chuckles] No, we actually--

1:16:28.467 --> 1:16:31.300
I mean, there's really...
I don't even wanna hear

1:16:31.367 --> 1:16:33.567
-about what happened
while I was gone.
-You don't wanna know.

1:16:33.567 --> 1:16:34.967
-You don't wanna know.
-Okay?

1:16:34.967 --> 1:16:38.166
-We made a pact
not to say anything.
-The boat is still afloat.

1:16:38.166 --> 1:16:41.200
All right, some things
I'd just rather not
know about.

1:16:41.266 --> 1:16:44.367
-Close the door
and we'll talk about it later.

[Vernon] <i>When the cat's away</i>

And it's possible
that what went on
on my absence,

1:16:50.734 --> 1:16:52.500
could make me hit the roof.

1:16:52.567 --> 1:16:54.767

<i>in the box,</i>

1:16:54.767 --> 1:16:56.767

1:16:58.100 --> 1:16:59.266
-[Bryan] Ready?
-[Vernon] Yeah.

1:16:59.266 --> 1:17:00.467

oh we hit five.

1:17:10.767 --> 1:17:12.867
-[Bryan] Nice.
-[Cary] Yeah,
not too bad, huh?

1:17:12.867 --> 1:17:16.000
-[Bryan] Geez, you come home
to five ounces.
-[Cary] Yeah, there you go.

1:17:16.066 --> 1:17:19.166
[narrator] <i>5.3 ounces is worth</i>
<i>over nine grand.</i>

Believe me, that's...
that is a load
off my shoulders.

1:17:33.867 --> 1:17:36.000
I mean, I gotta be able
to trust somebody

they might have landed us

1:17:44.667 --> 1:17:46.567
on a decent pay streak too.

1:17:46.567 --> 1:17:49.166
Maybe this is just
the spark we're looking for

1:17:49.166 --> 1:17:51.767

nobody got hurt,

1:18:00.066 --> 1:18:02.200
-we got gold in the box.
-That's all that counts.

1:18:02.266 --> 1:18:03.767
-Great job.
-All right.

1:18:03.767 --> 1:18:05.266
Boom 'em, Danno.

1:18:05.266 --> 1:18:06.367
Bag it and tag it.

1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:11.000
[narrator] <i>On the other side</i>
<i>of town...</i>

1:18:23.767 --> 1:18:26.200
Please let there be
a lot of gold.

1:18:26.266 --> 1:18:28.266
[narrator] <i>After a day</i>
<i>of highs and lows</i>

1:18:28.266 --> 1:18:31.100
<i>the Kellys are hoping</i>
<i>for a little Irish luck.</i>

1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:34.767
That's not looking
that promising.

1:18:35.867 --> 1:18:37.367
I hope it's not
the worst cleanup

1:18:37.367 --> 1:18:40.100
that I've had
in a really long time,

1:18:40.100 --> 1:18:43.266
'cause, literally,
I know I saw
more gold than that.

1:18:43.266 --> 1:18:45.300
There should be,
like, wow gold.

1:18:45.367 --> 1:18:47.266
There's definitely not
wow gold.

1:18:47.266 --> 1:18:49.300
It's like, "Wow.
Where is the gold?"

1:18:51.166 --> 1:18:53.467
At this point in the season,
I'm looking for a miracle.

1:18:54.467 --> 1:18:56.567
<i>A miracle</i>
<i>that the</i> Mistress <i>returns,</i>

1:18:56.567 --> 1:18:58.767
<i>a miracle that</i>
<i>the dive team's clicking,</i>

1:18:58.767 --> 1:19:02.367
<i>and a miracle</i>
<i>that we get enough gold</i>
<i>to keep Reaper Nation alive.</i>

1:19:02.367 --> 1:19:04.266
The truth is
that's a lot of miracles,

1:19:04.266 --> 1:19:05.800
and there's
not enough time left,

1:19:05.867 --> 1:19:07.900
but it's all I've got
to keep me going right now.

1:19:08.867 --> 1:19:11.367
Hey, you know what?
It's our first clean up.

1:19:11.367 --> 1:19:13.900
We've had a lot
of problems getting this gold,

1:19:13.967 --> 1:19:16.600
you know, so,
at least this right here,

1:19:16.667 --> 1:19:18.667
will give everyone
a little money
in their pocket.

1:19:21.867 --> 1:19:23.100
Okay, here we go.

1:19:23.100 --> 1:19:26.400
We are definitely
not millionaires.

1:19:27.567 --> 1:19:29.100
We're not even thousandaires.

1:19:33.867 --> 1:19:37.667
-[Anthony] Almost two ounces.
-1.86.

1:19:37.667 --> 1:19:41.867
[narrator] <i>1.86 ounces</i>
<i>is worth 3,300 bucks.</i>

1:19:41.867 --> 1:19:47.200
<i>Nowhere near</i>
<i>what they need to make</i>
<i>their $125,000 payment.</i>

1:19:47.266 --> 1:19:49.767
[Kris] Worst gold cleanup
we've had in so long,

1:19:49.767 --> 1:19:51.000
but everything's working
at least.

1:19:51.066 --> 1:19:52.500
Okay, let's call it a day.

1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:55.467
Get ready out there,
and get ready for the next
nice day of mining.

1:19:58.066 --> 1:20:00.166
Well, so much for miracles.

1:20:00.166 --> 1:20:02.100
So I'm trying to keep
a positive attitude

1:20:02.100 --> 1:20:05.467
to the team, but basically
I'm lying to myself.

1:20:05.467 --> 1:20:07.266
It's a [bleep] joke.

1:20:07.266 --> 1:20:09.266
I was on amazing gold.

1:20:10.767 --> 1:20:12.400
I don't wanna give up
on Reaper Nation,

1:20:12.467 --> 1:20:13.900
but it's not
looking good right now.

1:20:13.967 --> 1:20:16.166
I'm just hoping right now,
in these final days,

1:20:16.166 --> 1:20:18.900
we can turn everything
right around.

1:20:18.967 --> 1:20:22.266
By, hopefully next week,
we'll be running
the <i>Mistress</i> again.

1:20:22.266 --> 1:20:25.867
But hopefully,
we start getting
some real time in.

1:20:25.867 --> 1:20:28.567
Hopefully, start killing it
24 hours a day.

1:20:29.567 --> 1:20:31.100
I know that's
a lot of hopefully.

1:20:35.467 --> 1:20:36.567
[narrator] <i>Across town...</i>

1:20:45.367 --> 1:20:47.567
[Shawn] <i>Had a good day</i>
<i>of mining.</i>

1:20:47.567 --> 1:20:50.200
<i>Everything was working.</i>

1:20:50.266 --> 1:20:52.166
<i>Dave was in town,</i>
<i>we had some good weather,</i>

1:20:52.166 --> 1:20:53.800
<i>got out there and mined.</i>

1:20:53.867 --> 1:20:56.967
Let's see if we made it count.

1:20:56.967 --> 1:21:00.100
[narrator] <i>After a round</i>
<i>in the ring with</i>
<i>the newly repaired</i> Myrtle,

1:21:00.100 --> 1:21:03.100
<i>Shawn's ready to reap</i>
<i>the rewards.</i>

1:21:03.166 --> 1:21:04.467
[Shawn] <i>We were</i>
<i>on the good stuff.</i>

1:21:04.467 --> 1:21:06.166
We kept her going
through the night

1:21:06.166 --> 1:21:08.000
I'm expecting
to see triple digits.

1:21:12.567 --> 1:21:14.867
I need 3,000 ounces
this summer.

1:21:14.867 --> 1:21:17.166
So, I'm hoping to go big
the rest of the season.

1:21:18.767 --> 1:21:20.266
Let's see what we got.

1:21:20.266 --> 1:21:21.300
Here we go.

1:21:21.734 --> 1:21:22.567
Bam!

1:21:24.567 --> 1:21:27.734
There's 20, 30, 40...

1:21:28.500 --> 1:21:30.200
50, 90, 100.

1:21:31.166 --> 1:21:34.767
18, 120.

1:21:36.734 --> 1:21:38.066
We have a pile of gold.

1:21:39.166 --> 1:21:43.900
[narrator] <i>120 ounces</i>
<i>is worth over $215,000,</i>

1:21:43.967 --> 1:21:47.967
<i>and the</i> Myrtle
<i>and her captain are primed</i>
<i>for a big finish this summer.</i>

1:21:49.166 --> 1:21:51.467
[Shawn] Really good
<i>Myrtle</i> cleanup.

1:21:51.467 --> 1:21:53.867
Put this away,
get it in the jar.

1:21:53.867 --> 1:21:57.166
Best sound ever
is gold piling up.

1:21:57.166 --> 1:21:59.066
<i>When the</i> Myrtle's <i>firing</i>
<i>on all cylinders</i>

1:21:59.066 --> 1:22:00.967
<i>there's nothing like her</i>
<i>on the Bering Sea.</i>

1:22:02.100 --> 1:22:04.300
If she doesn't give me
any more fits

1:22:04.367 --> 1:22:07.734
the sky is the limit,
and 3,000 ounces
is within reach.

1:22:09.100 --> 1:22:12.166
<i>All the operations</i>
<i>are hitting on</i>
<i>all the cylinders.</i>

1:22:12.166 --> 1:22:13.433
<i>Here we go.</i>

1:22:15.500 --> 1:22:18.734
[narrator] <i>The pendulum swings</i>
<i>in Shawn's direction</i>

1:22:18.734 --> 1:22:21.600
<i>while Emily and Zeke</i>
<i>hold strong,</i>

1:22:21.667 --> 1:22:25.567

1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:29.500
<i>Next time, on</i> Bering Sea Gold.

1:22:29.567 --> 1:22:31.300
This is gonna be a good one.

1:22:31.367 --> 1:22:33.367
[laughs] Oh, yeah.

1:22:33.367 --> 1:22:36.000
Man, I love it when
a plan comes together.

1:22:36.066 --> 1:22:39.100
<i>Dig until the weather turns.</i>

1:22:39.166 --> 1:22:41.200
[man on radio] <i>Don't know</i>
<i>what the weather's doing,</i>

[Nate speaking on radio]

1:22:43.266 --> 1:22:45.500
[Zeke] I want you to hook
the nozzle up and come up.

1:22:45.567 --> 1:22:46.467
[Nate grunts]

1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:50.000
<i>They're dead in the water,</i>

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.900
<i>a coast guard</i>
<i>is nowhere around.</i> [bleep]

1:22:53.867 --> 1:22:56.066
[Shawn] We're gonna go
find him, get him home safe.

1:22:56.066 --> 1:22:58.166
-[thuds]
-[bleep]

1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:00.300
It is rough.

1:23:00.367 --> 1:23:02.166
Hey, you guys.
He's right there. I got him.

1:23:02.166 --> 1:23:06.667
[shouts] Abandon ship,
my engines are swamping.

1:23:06.667 --> 1:23:08.767
-We got some damage
to the boat.
-[producer] Guys! Hey.

1:23:11.467 --> 1:23:12.667
[Thomas] Let's go [bleep].

1:23:12.734 --> 1:23:14.567
There's a hole right here
going through the boat.

1:23:14.567 --> 1:23:17.867
I gotta get out of here.
Watch out, guys,
this is a big one.

1:23:18.166 --> 1:23:19.300
Hang on!
