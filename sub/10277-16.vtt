WEBVTT

00:04.960 --> 00:06.501
Previously on E. R.

00:07.721 --> 00:09.232
Morning, Elisabeth.

00:09.233 --> 00:10.811
I've got it, I've got it.

00:11.726 --> 00:13.022
Damn it!

00:13.023 --> 00:14.889
- You're sure you want to go in there?
- Oh, yeah.

00:15.090 --> 00:17.095
We're not gonna be able to talk.

00:17.736 --> 00:20.592
Let's go get some coffee. Come on.

00:21.045 --> 00:22.543
Why didn't you tell me?

00:22.544 --> 00:25.057
I didn't want it to define me, Mark.

00:25.058 --> 00:29.669
I didn't wanna see it in people's
eyes. I didn't want to see it at all.

00:30.782 --> 00:32.240
And...

00:32.241 --> 00:34.145
I'm scared.

00:36.105 --> 00:38.181
E. R. 6x16 "UNDER CONTROL"

00:38.399 --> 00:40.059
Pass me some tape.

00:40.484 --> 00:42.026
Not that much.

00:42.903 --> 00:46.271
Dad, you gotta finish up, okay?
I'm on at three.

00:46.489 --> 00:48.232
You got that bulb?

00:48.533 --> 00:51.866
Lucky I found it.
They don't make these anymore.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.489
Bet we haven't seen these slides
in 25 years.

00:55.705 --> 00:58.243
Your mom had me drag
that camera all over.

00:58.458 --> 01:02.834
I made an appointment for you
on Monday with the oncologist.

01:03.045 --> 01:04.753
I said I didn't want that.

01:04.962 --> 01:06.706
Can you just talk to him?

01:07.549 --> 01:09.209
You got that bulb?

01:11.594 --> 01:13.717
Don't get fingerprints on it.

01:15.055 --> 01:19.302
- They said the cancer was incurable.
- Doesn't mean we can't treat it.

01:19.476 --> 01:21.183
Plug that in, will you?

01:22.812 --> 01:24.638
Our trip to the Grand Canyon.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.725
You bought the wrong bulb.

01:33.237 --> 01:34.779
This was in the closet.

01:34.989 --> 01:39.531
I always pack that last. Be a dear
and empty me the top drawer.

01:39.743 --> 01:43.906
I can't stay long. I've got
an incarcerated hernia in the O.R.

01:45.665 --> 01:47.538
What shall I do with this?

01:48.459 --> 01:53.001
- Would you return it to David?
- He wore only one sock home?

01:53.171 --> 01:57.038
He's a sweet man. Much like his son.

01:57.508 --> 02:00.959
- Does that mean you approve?
- I've seen you glow...

02:01.178 --> 02:04.428
...whenever he's around.
You two belong together.

02:04.639 --> 02:07.723
Since when are you an expert
on relationships?

02:07.934 --> 02:12.061
I've enjoyed being single.
I've no regrets.

02:12.521 --> 02:14.763
But what about you, Elizabeth?

02:15.524 --> 02:17.480
What will make you happy?

02:17.901 --> 02:21.269
You want to discuss it
as you're about to leave?

02:23.822 --> 02:28.199
Why don't you drop by the hospital?
We'll grab a coffee.

02:28.368 --> 02:30.574
Yes. Absolutely.

02:30.787 --> 02:32.364
I'd love that.

02:34.331 --> 02:35.362
Mother?

02:37.292 --> 02:39.415
Would you return those as well?

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.011 --> 02:51.548
- Welcome back, Carter.
- Thank you, Haleh.

02:52.805 --> 02:55.510
- How are you feeling?
- Ready to go.

02:55.725 --> 02:59.010
I saw your MRI.
You're recovering just fine.

02:59.228 --> 03:01.469
Yeah. I'll get rid of these soon.

03:01.688 --> 03:05.056
Carter, take your time.
Don't push it. All right?

03:06.901 --> 03:08.774
John, how are you doing?

03:09.528 --> 03:12.279
- Tell me if you need anything.
- I'm okay.

04:53.659 --> 04:55.615
- Seen Abby?
- Not lately.

04:55.827 --> 04:58.744
Labs are back on two of her patients.

04:58.955 --> 05:01.280
You're late. Deal with this.

05:01.499 --> 05:06.076
- Where's Kovac and Weaver?
- They're on tonight. You're the man.

05:07.337 --> 05:10.373
- Did you check my x-ray?
- Can you take her?

05:10.590 --> 05:14.669
- I've got four already.
- Randi, find this woman's doctor.

05:14.843 --> 05:19.339
- We got angry patients waiting.
- It's Saturday. Everyone shows up.

05:19.514 --> 05:23.511
- You tell them that.
- Dr. Greene? Phone. It's your dad.

05:23.684 --> 05:28.061
Phone book? Try the desk drawer.
Dad, I can't hold.

05:28.271 --> 05:32.518
- Has anyone seen the Xeroform?
- It's here under the Tegaderm.

05:33.526 --> 05:35.851
So, what time do you get off?

05:36.028 --> 05:37.191
Ten.

05:37.363 --> 05:40.233
- Got plans for tonight?
- Washing my hair.

05:40.449 --> 05:43.698
- Have fun.
- Not the bedroom desk.

05:43.910 --> 05:47.693
Frank Bacon, ICU charge nurse.
Passed out in the unit.

05:47.872 --> 05:51.785
- I'm fine. Can I go to work?
- After we clear you, Mr. Bacon.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.250
- Call me Frank.
- Mark, three patients left.

05:55.461 --> 05:58.415
Dad, I gotta go. Call 411.
Problem?

05:58.631 --> 06:00.006
Do something.

06:00.215 --> 06:04.426
Randi, hand me the phone.
Haleh, bring the rolling cart.

06:04.636 --> 06:09.214
Chen, Abby, Malucci, over here.
We're gonna do power rounds.

06:09.432 --> 06:12.349
- Carter?
- Paramedics are bringing an O.D. in.

06:12.559 --> 06:13.722
Ready for that?

06:13.894 --> 06:15.553
All right. It's yours.

06:17.355 --> 06:19.264
- How are you?
- It won't stop.

06:19.482 --> 06:22.103
Dr. Dave will be back in a minute.

06:22.318 --> 06:26.397
Randi, I need a nasal speculum
and a Merocel sponge in 3-A.

06:26.571 --> 06:27.769
Thanks.

06:27.947 --> 06:28.978
3-B?

06:29.157 --> 06:33.236
- Kim Tadlock, ascites.
- CBC and a three-way of the abdomen.

06:33.410 --> 06:37.075
- Check for a fluid wave?
- Get the labs first. 3-C?

06:37.247 --> 06:40.034
- I've got him.
- Cute guy with syncope.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.909
All right. Let's go.

06:42.501 --> 06:46.166
- Where's she going?
- Romano wants cuts through the jaw.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.586
Ever see a tongue-blade test?

06:48.799 --> 06:53.092
Ma'am, I want you to bite down on this
as hard as you can.

06:53.261 --> 06:55.419
Chen, you give it a twang.

06:55.638 --> 06:58.211
Let us know if it hurts, okay?

06:59.725 --> 07:02.595
All right, no fracture. Cancel the CT.

07:02.810 --> 07:06.060
- That's it?
- A simple stick does the trick.

07:06.272 --> 07:07.434
One. Two. Three.

07:07.606 --> 07:11.306
- Adam Pulido, 38, probable overdose.
- I wanna die.

07:11.526 --> 07:14.443
- What did he take?
- I found Benadryl packs.

07:14.612 --> 07:16.651
- Anything else?
- Leave me alone.

07:16.864 --> 07:20.315
Start with a CBC, EKG,
blood and urine tox screen.

07:20.534 --> 07:22.194
Move, I need to do this.

07:22.411 --> 07:25.281
- Do it on the other side.
- The IV's there.

07:26.122 --> 07:29.455
- Carol, your nanny's on the phone.
- Ask her to hold.

07:29.625 --> 07:31.416
- She's new.
- Take it.

07:31.627 --> 07:34.960
-110/78. He's stable.
- Hello?

07:35.130 --> 07:37.039
Did you try the bouncy seat?

07:37.257 --> 07:40.423
That stops her from crying sometimes.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.212
- Get away!
- Come on!

07:42.428 --> 07:44.634
- I gotta go.
- Let go of me!

07:44.846 --> 07:46.305
- Calm down.
- You okay?

07:46.514 --> 07:49.550
I'm okay. Get him some soft restraints.

07:50.643 --> 07:52.434
Got a lot of fluid in there.

07:52.978 --> 07:55.599
So the colon cancer spread?

07:56.523 --> 07:57.554
Yeah.

07:57.732 --> 08:01.646
They said it could happen.
I didn't respond to chemo.

08:02.195 --> 08:04.270
We should tap your belly.

08:04.572 --> 08:06.480
That's pretty tender.

08:07.949 --> 08:11.282
- Could I interest you in some morphine?
- Really?

08:12.537 --> 08:16.664
Last time they wouldn't give it to me
until I saw the surgeon.

08:16.874 --> 08:19.910
Well, nobody should sit around in pain.

08:20.127 --> 08:23.080
You've been paying attention
on rounds, huh?

08:23.671 --> 08:25.628
Be back with the morphine.

08:26.132 --> 08:28.457
- What's this?
- Nursing schedule.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.792
- You need to be monitored.
- I'm fine.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.804
You know the drill.
Let's hook you up.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.643
So your blood pressure is 90-

08:41.144 --> 08:43.220
90/60.

08:43.438 --> 08:47.518
That's normal. All those
years of triathlon, you know?

08:47.733 --> 08:51.149
- We still need to monitor you.
- I know why I fainted.

08:51.320 --> 08:54.273
I ran 12 miles today.
I skipped breakfast.

08:54.489 --> 08:59.150
- Want something from the cafeteria?
- No. Never touch that stuff.

09:00.661 --> 09:04.030
What is that on your chain there?

09:04.248 --> 09:08.292
It's an ancient Roman coin.
Found it in the Mediterranean.

09:08.501 --> 09:10.079
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

09:10.294 --> 09:12.500
Here, let me help you with that.

09:12.838 --> 09:13.953
Thank you.

09:14.173 --> 09:17.043
You need some help over there,
Dr. Chen?

09:17.592 --> 09:20.628
No. Everything is under control.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.008
Good.

09:23.848 --> 09:27.761
No, Dad. I don't care
if they have the part.

09:27.976 --> 09:30.727
We'll talk about this
later, all right?

09:31.396 --> 09:34.515
- Difference of opinion?
- He's driving me crazy.

09:34.732 --> 09:38.599
My mom's unpredictable.
Suddenly, she wants to parent.

09:38.819 --> 09:41.392
He won't even discuss
treatment options.

09:41.571 --> 09:42.602
For what?

09:43.364 --> 09:45.570
- His emphysema.
- Is he worse?

09:45.783 --> 09:47.194
I think so.

09:48.410 --> 09:52.870
- What've you got?
- History of angina. Chest pain.

09:53.039 --> 09:55.494
- Need a monitored bed.
- We're full.

09:55.708 --> 09:58.625
- Close to criticals.
- No. We can handle this.

09:58.836 --> 10:02.370
Okay. Let's move the TIA to 5.

10:02.547 --> 10:05.880
CHF to 3. And we're gonna
put him in 2.

10:06.092 --> 10:09.840
- See you next trauma.
- Randi, I'm gonna get a refill.

10:11.513 --> 10:14.514
- Sorry. You want some privacy?
- No. I'm done.

10:15.558 --> 10:17.349
We staffed okay for tonight?

10:17.560 --> 10:21.509
Down a nurse. I'm working on it.
What did I do with the lid?

10:21.730 --> 10:22.928
This it?

10:23.565 --> 10:24.728
Thanks.

10:25.150 --> 10:29.396
Some days they take a bottle.
Other days they just want mom.

10:29.570 --> 10:31.942
- Carter needs you.
- Can you cover?

10:32.156 --> 10:35.275
Sorry. GSW to the head coming in.

10:35.492 --> 10:37.069
I'll get the gunshot.

10:37.744 --> 10:39.203
- How much Ativan?
- Four.

10:39.412 --> 10:41.451
- Push two more.
- Stats down to 81.

10:41.664 --> 10:43.621
- Intubation tray.
- He's seizing?

10:43.833 --> 10:47.746
Overdose is worse than we thought.
He's not breathing.

10:47.919 --> 10:50.244
BP's only 60 systolic.

10:50.421 --> 10:53.588
All right. Start dopamine.
10 mics per kilo.

10:55.926 --> 10:57.206
You all right?

10:58.262 --> 10:59.921
Just pump up the bed.

11:00.180 --> 11:01.888
- Bradying down.
- Get Mark.

11:02.098 --> 11:04.589
No. I can do it.
That's high enough.

11:04.892 --> 11:08.759
Connie, page the renal fellow.
This guy needs dialysis.

11:09.855 --> 11:11.265
All right. I'm in.

11:11.439 --> 11:15.187
- Know who shot him?
- No. Probably a drug deal gone bad.

11:15.401 --> 11:19.445
Abby, glove up. You're gonna
put in a central line.

11:19.863 --> 11:23.446
On my count. One. Two. Three.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.451
Order a head CT and lateral C-spine.

11:26.661 --> 11:29.033
There's gray matter everywhere.

11:29.246 --> 11:33.872
Start mannitol and hyperventilate.
We have an organ donor here.

11:34.084 --> 11:37.701
- BP's 80 palp.
- Let's get his pressure up.

11:38.504 --> 11:40.128
Is this a good angle?

11:40.297 --> 11:42.788
Aim it towards the sternal notch.

11:46.553 --> 11:47.667
Hit the clavicle.

11:47.971 --> 11:51.421
March it down slowly until
you slip under the bone.

11:54.351 --> 11:57.933
Lower the angle or you'll give
him a pneumothorax.

12:00.690 --> 12:03.394
- I'm up against the bone.
- Reposition.

12:05.486 --> 12:08.854
- Mark, we need that line in now.
- Give her a chance.

12:09.072 --> 12:10.732
This guy's brain-dead.

12:11.699 --> 12:14.569
- Nothing.
- We're not perfusing his organs.

12:14.785 --> 12:16.196
I'll have to do it.

12:16.412 --> 12:20.160
Got a driver's license.
Robert Jackson from Naperville.

12:20.332 --> 12:21.660
He's 18.

12:21.833 --> 12:26.328
Track down his parents. We need their
consent to make him a donor.

12:26.503 --> 12:29.837
Got it. Let's get two
liters on the rapid infuser.

12:32.801 --> 12:35.256
His QRS is widening.
He needs dialysis.

12:35.469 --> 12:38.719
Dialysis is not used
in Benadryl overdose.

12:38.931 --> 12:41.682
I read a case where
hemoperfusion worked.

12:41.850 --> 12:44.969
Extra-corporeal elimination
won't work.

12:45.186 --> 12:46.349
We should try.

12:46.521 --> 12:49.854
I'm not putting this man at risk
for hemolysis...

12:50.190 --> 12:54.437
...for an unproven procedure
you read about. Excuse me.

12:54.653 --> 12:56.811
This is not a renal case.

12:57.030 --> 12:58.903
Like hell it isn't.

13:00.699 --> 13:02.857
- Push more bicarb?
- Won't help.

13:03.076 --> 13:04.405
Run of seven.

13:05.996 --> 13:09.245
Damn it. I'll write the dialysis orders.

13:09.457 --> 13:11.533
A nephrologist has to do that.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.878
The article says exactly what to do.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.127
Kerry did hemoperfusion on an O.D.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.913
We should do it.
I know this will work.

13:22.134 --> 13:25.918
Write out the orders.
I know a dialysis nurse.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.130
Set me up for a femoral line.

13:32.894 --> 13:34.553
- Wanna run this?
- Sure.

13:34.728 --> 13:36.187
- Pulseless.
- Abby?

13:36.396 --> 13:38.721
- Defibrillate at 200.
- Sounds good.

13:38.940 --> 13:40.600
- Charged and ready.
- Clear.

13:43.736 --> 13:45.894
- Get water!
- Turn off the oxygen.

13:46.071 --> 13:48.111
- In V-tach.
- Start compressions.

13:48.782 --> 13:51.154
- Oh, it smells!
- Two prep razors.

13:51.368 --> 13:54.570
- I got this side.
- Abby, get the paddles.

13:56.038 --> 13:58.611
- Rambo. Why are you here?
- He's my patient.

13:58.832 --> 14:02.664
- But your name's Frank.
- My nickname from Desert Storm.

14:03.003 --> 14:04.034
Clear!

14:07.423 --> 14:08.502
Normal sinus.

14:10.467 --> 14:14.796
- I've never seen that happen.
- Me either. Sometimes you wing it.

14:18.015 --> 14:22.178
Exam 2 is set up for
charcoal hemoperfusion for that O.D.

14:22.394 --> 14:24.967
Good. Keep me posted.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.471
What's up?

14:28.649 --> 14:31.520
- Dropped his pressure.
- Lily, two more units.

14:31.819 --> 14:36.361
- You don't have much time.
- I know. We need to get him to the O.R.

14:36.531 --> 14:39.448
- You find his family?
- It's a phony license.

14:39.659 --> 14:42.908
- Kids buy them on the street.
- Has he been reported missing?

14:43.120 --> 14:47.366
- Sent his photo out. So far, nothing.
- We need that consent.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.874
Pressure's up to 90.

14:50.043 --> 14:51.620
That's encouraging.

14:52.461 --> 14:55.996
It could take hours to line up
the procurement teams.

14:56.215 --> 14:59.417
- Be realistic.
- I'll save five lives with his organs.

14:59.634 --> 15:02.172
- He could arrest.
- I won't let him.

15:04.388 --> 15:08.172
Let Kate sleep for an hour.
Then wake her for her bottle.

15:08.392 --> 15:10.183
I'll talk to you later.

15:10.852 --> 15:14.932
Carol, I need 3-0 nylon.
Dori, I think we are ready.

15:18.233 --> 15:20.806
- You okay?
- I contaminated my gloves.

15:21.027 --> 15:23.732
- Sorry.
- Just give me another pair.

15:23.905 --> 15:27.024
Did Dr. Krupp say why
he's using citrate?

15:28.742 --> 15:30.284
He always uses heparin.

15:31.203 --> 15:34.120
I'll page him.
He say when to check an A.C.T.?

15:34.331 --> 15:36.537
Do it 30 minutes into the run.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.919
I better check.
He's very particular.

15:40.085 --> 15:42.291
Dori, these aren't his orders.

15:42.504 --> 15:45.421
He won't help us.
We got them from a journal.

15:45.590 --> 15:47.582
I won't do this without him.

15:47.759 --> 15:50.593
His complexes are narrowing.

15:50.761 --> 15:52.754
- I'll lose my job.
- Save his life.

15:52.930 --> 15:54.637
No. We're stopping.

15:54.848 --> 15:58.263
- I'll take responsibility.
- Carter, can you explain?

15:59.769 --> 16:03.268
- I told you about it.
- He told you nephrology said no?

16:03.439 --> 16:06.641
- It's working. Let us finish.
- Carter, step out.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.849
Carol, monitor his vitals.
Keep the dialysis going.

16:11.070 --> 16:14.604
Sorry, Dori. I'll speak
with the renal service.

16:17.284 --> 16:19.490
You have a problem, come to me.

16:19.703 --> 16:22.454
- He's improving.
- You didn't give me...

16:22.663 --> 16:25.699
- ... the whole story.
- I can handle this.

16:25.916 --> 16:29.913
- It's your first day back.
- Mark, we need you.

16:30.128 --> 16:32.417
I wanna know everything you do.

16:32.630 --> 16:36.295
Six months old: fever, vomiting.
Had a seizure.

16:36.509 --> 16:39.046
- Where's Cleo?
- It's her day off.

16:39.886 --> 16:42.460
- Has she had seizures before?
- No.

16:42.639 --> 16:45.509
- And the vomiting started?
- When she woke up.

16:45.725 --> 16:49.259
- What's her name?
- Estrella. Is she okay?

16:49.978 --> 16:54.141
She looks dehydrated.
Chuny, set up an interosseus line.

16:54.357 --> 16:56.480
Bolus, 20 per kilo of saline.

16:56.692 --> 16:57.855
She's tachy at 160.

16:57.944 --> 17:00.979
CBC, lytes, blood and urine cultures.

17:01.155 --> 17:02.981
Full septic workup.

17:07.410 --> 17:10.529
- What are you doing?
- Giving her fluids.

17:11.329 --> 17:12.990
Please don't hurt her.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.284
Take her out. Bring her back
after the spinal tap.

17:18.502 --> 17:22.166
- No. I want to stay with the baby.
- Come on, honey.

17:22.673 --> 17:26.338
- Please. Can I stay with my baby?
- It's okay.

17:28.678 --> 17:32.806
- Still normal sinus. How long?
- Until your lytes come back.

17:33.015 --> 17:37.427
- And my patients?
- Told the unit you took a sick day.

17:38.436 --> 17:40.844
Then I guess I'm your prisoner.

17:41.189 --> 17:45.138
Have you seen Dr. Greene?
He's supposed to help me.

17:45.359 --> 17:47.647
He's in Trauma. I can do it.

17:48.111 --> 17:50.187
- Kim, this is Dr. Chen.
- Hey, doc.

17:50.363 --> 17:54.313
I've numbed the left quadrant.
14-gauge angiocath okay?

17:54.534 --> 17:56.858
Use a Z-track so it won't leak.

17:57.036 --> 17:59.443
And what labs should I send off?

17:59.663 --> 18:03.494
Cell count, glucose, protein,
Gram's stain, and culture.

18:03.708 --> 18:04.870
- Thanks.
- No problem.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.578
There's the fluid.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.338
- Good flow. You got it?
- Thank you.

18:16.552 --> 18:18.343
I'll be in Exam 4.

18:18.929 --> 18:23.223
- Well, it wasn't so bad.
- Actually, it's starting to hurt.

18:23.392 --> 18:25.099
I'll readjust the catheter.

18:27.061 --> 18:30.845
If I were you, I'd order an
upright chest film, stat.

18:33.066 --> 18:34.774
- Lost the pulse.
- In V-tach.

18:34.985 --> 18:38.069
Charge the paddles to 20. Bag her.

18:38.238 --> 18:41.072
- What's going on?
- Septic or meningitis.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.520
Clear.

18:43.617 --> 18:45.942
- Yes, Carter?
- I can come back.

18:46.161 --> 18:47.738
Charge. What's up?

18:47.912 --> 18:51.447
My O.D.'s QRS is down to. 12.
He's off pressors.

18:51.666 --> 18:52.910
Clear.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.326
- Go on.
- Can I extubate him?

18:55.544 --> 18:57.287
- Charging.
- In a half hour.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.295
- Clear.
- Thanks.

19:00.048 --> 19:02.420
- What are you doing?
- Checking labs.

19:02.633 --> 19:05.587
- No patients allowed.
- He's a nurse. I let him.

19:05.803 --> 19:09.005
- Frank, why are you here?
- My labs came back.

19:09.222 --> 19:13.800
- Your patient has a low sodium.
- That's all the water I drank.

19:14.018 --> 19:17.885
- Just need to fluid-restrict.
- Let's go back to bed.

19:18.105 --> 19:20.346
She wants to keep me here.

19:20.565 --> 19:22.937
- He's a piece of work.
- You're not?

19:23.109 --> 19:26.809
- What's that mean?
- Eating cereal out of an emesis basin?

19:27.029 --> 19:30.611
- Randi, did my nanny call again?
- No, thank God.

19:30.824 --> 19:32.615
What is that?

19:32.826 --> 19:36.325
Nothing around except
cereal and a jar of milk.

19:36.537 --> 19:38.364
- A jar of milk?
- Yeah.

19:38.581 --> 19:41.534
- Oh, God, Malucci!
- What?

19:42.042 --> 19:44.877
- Resume compressions.
- She's in V-fib.

19:45.086 --> 19:47.921
She should come around
with 0-2 and epi.

19:48.131 --> 19:50.621
- Mark, our guy's crashing.
- Clear.

19:51.592 --> 19:52.623
No change.

19:53.594 --> 19:57.211
- What's happened?
- He's hypotensive. Starting Levophed.

19:57.430 --> 20:01.130
Chuny, procainamide, 100 slow
IV push. Shock again.

20:01.976 --> 20:05.225
- You gonna call it?
- I want him to be a donor.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.061
Not without his consent.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.980
- Last epi?
- Four minutes.

20:09.190 --> 20:11.313
- Another cc.
- Get a court order?

20:11.484 --> 20:12.978
Not in this case.

20:13.152 --> 20:16.603
- I'll keep him up till we find family.
- Fine.

20:16.822 --> 20:19.491
- Shock again.
- Clear.

20:21.784 --> 20:25.069
The black stripe is air
under the diaphragm.

20:25.913 --> 20:29.696
- The needle perforated the colon.
- It hurts like hell.

20:29.916 --> 20:31.079
I'm really sorry.

20:31.292 --> 20:35.076
Perforation is a known
complication of the procedure.

20:36.922 --> 20:41.749
- What do we do now?
- We could operate to repair the defect.

20:43.803 --> 20:46.258
How long will I be in the hospital?

20:46.472 --> 20:49.757
A week. But then a two-month recovery.

20:50.642 --> 20:54.853
Doc, they don't expect me
to live that long.

20:57.064 --> 20:59.935
What happens if I don't
have the operation?

21:00.859 --> 21:03.397
The hole could seal off.

21:05.363 --> 21:09.028
But you'd probably develop
an infection, peritonitis.

21:09.367 --> 21:11.691
- And then I'd die.
- Yeah.

21:13.370 --> 21:16.287
- More atropine.
- Pacer pads ready.

21:16.498 --> 21:18.988
- Holding compressions.
- Still flatline.

21:19.208 --> 21:20.868
CBC and lytes are normal.

21:21.252 --> 21:23.458
What is wrong with this baby?

21:23.670 --> 21:27.039
- Start pacing at 180.
- Pacer's on.

21:27.549 --> 21:30.039
No capture. Turn up the gain.

21:30.384 --> 21:31.843
Come on.

21:32.553 --> 21:35.340
- Still no capture.
- Turn up the rate.

21:35.847 --> 21:38.089
Can't feel a pulse. More epi?

21:38.308 --> 21:41.261
- How many rounds so far?
- Seven.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.022
Stop bagging.

21:46.315 --> 21:47.394
That's it.

21:47.566 --> 21:48.728
We're done.

21:50.402 --> 21:54.446
Clean up the baby
before I bring in the mother.

22:00.827 --> 22:03.234
I don't want the surgery.

22:03.913 --> 22:06.404
- It's the only way-
- I understand.

22:06.582 --> 22:09.785
But I don't want another surgery.

22:14.839 --> 22:16.547
Well, then we-

22:19.093 --> 22:23.801
We could treat you with antibiotics
and hope for the best.

22:26.641 --> 22:28.763
I'm sorry. Would you excuse me?

22:33.522 --> 22:35.561
I'll be right back.

22:38.943 --> 22:42.477
Dr. Benton? Aren't we supposed
to fix our mistakes?

22:42.654 --> 22:43.686
Usually.

22:43.906 --> 22:47.536
Your patient has end-stage cancer.
Sugery is only going to prolong is suffering.

22:47.548 --> 22:51.267
- You have to respect his wishes.
- He's gonna die because I made a mistake.

22:51.302 --> 22:53.528
- He's gonna die anyway.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.620
- We need you over here.
- What is it?

23:00.169 --> 23:02.742
Doctor, please help me. My baby.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.457
- Give her something?
- No.

23:04.632 --> 23:05.794
- My baby.
- Pilar.

23:06.008 --> 23:10.918
- She's still warm. Do something.
- Pilar, we tried. I explained that.

23:11.137 --> 23:14.303
No. She's still warm. My baby.

23:16.725 --> 23:21.636
Please. Use your machines,
give her the medicine.

23:21.938 --> 23:24.642
Blow in her mouth.
Make her breathe.

23:25.149 --> 23:28.150
- We can't.
- Yes, you can! You can!

23:28.360 --> 23:32.404
You're a good doctor.
You can save her. Please.

23:32.614 --> 23:34.653
She's still warm, my baby.

23:36.742 --> 23:40.407
Pilar, she's dead. I'm sorry.

23:54.841 --> 23:57.877
- What's up?
- Cops found him under the El.

23:58.094 --> 24:00.382
- How are you doing?
- Kiss my ass.

24:00.596 --> 24:05.423
Start a banana bag, order a head CT
and prep him for sutures.

24:06.393 --> 24:10.010
- What do you got?
- CVA and two new patients to present.

24:10.229 --> 24:12.435
- And Frank's workup?
- I'm fine.

24:12.648 --> 24:15.483
He saw us get slammed
so he pitched in.

24:15.692 --> 24:19.274
There's a complication
with my colon-cancer patient.

24:19.487 --> 24:24.113
- Thought I was gonna supervise.
- You were busy. I asked Dr. Chen.

24:24.325 --> 24:28.191
If you'd given a history,
you'd have tapped the midline...

24:28.370 --> 24:32.912
- ... instead of perfing the bowel.
- He spiked a fever. He's septic.

24:33.124 --> 24:37.073
- Make sure he's comfortable now.
- I'd like to stay with him.

24:37.294 --> 24:40.497
We need you here.
Nurses can take care of him.

24:40.714 --> 24:43.465
After your shift, go to Pathology...

24:43.674 --> 24:46.545
...and practice procedures
with Dr. Upton.

24:47.052 --> 24:49.424
Dr. Greene, got a live one here!

24:50.680 --> 24:51.712
What happened?

24:51.890 --> 24:56.717
I'm feeding my buddy's Gila monster,
when it bites me. He won't let go.

24:56.936 --> 24:59.605
- We have to kill it?
- As a last resort.

24:59.813 --> 25:02.565
Grab a couple of vascular clamps.

25:02.732 --> 25:04.808
I'm not going near that thing.

25:05.026 --> 25:07.398
- I got it.
- All right. Thanks.

25:07.903 --> 25:11.651
- Please, don't hurt him.
- I'll do my best.

25:15.410 --> 25:18.529
Those jaws are awfully strong.

25:25.210 --> 25:28.543
- Malucci, get ready to catch him.
- In what?

25:28.921 --> 25:30.713
Grab a kick bucket.

25:34.259 --> 25:36.715
All right. Here we go.

25:36.928 --> 25:39.253
Nice and easy. Do it together.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.799
Almost. Almost. There!

25:45.102 --> 25:49.265
- Now what do I do?
- Call Animal Control or the zoo.

25:49.814 --> 25:50.893
Need some help?

25:51.107 --> 25:55.353
Why don't you monitor his vitals,
three grams of Unasyn...

25:55.569 --> 25:57.443
...and irrigate the wound.

26:00.407 --> 26:04.071
- How is he?
- He's on dopamine and Levophed.

26:04.285 --> 26:07.321
- He won't last.
- V-tach. Charge the paddles.

26:07.538 --> 26:09.779
- No, he's a DNR.
- Let me code him.

26:09.956 --> 26:12.447
- It's futile.
- I'm pushing lidocaine.

26:12.625 --> 26:17.963
You're tying up nurses and a trauma
room on a case going nowhere. Stop.

26:18.297 --> 26:22.839
His organs are viable. His family
would want some good out of this.

26:23.051 --> 26:26.633
- Normal sinus. Want a lidocaine drip?
- I'll start one.

26:26.846 --> 26:30.677
Don't keep flogging him.
I mean it. He's a DNR.

26:32.059 --> 26:36.767
Labs are back from Trauma 2.
Tox screen's positive for amphetamines.

26:36.980 --> 26:38.260
Let me see.

26:39.023 --> 26:41.264
- Oh, man.
- What?

26:41.483 --> 26:45.694
- It's the baby.
- She was killed with amphetamines?

26:56.163 --> 27:01.500
The labs came back on Estrella.
She tested positive for amphetamines.

27:02.668 --> 27:05.075
My baby died from drugs?

27:05.295 --> 27:08.130
Could anyone have given
something to her?

27:08.340 --> 27:11.755
- No one has drugs at home.
- Know anyone who uses?

27:11.968 --> 27:13.925
Friends or relatives?

27:18.348 --> 27:22.262
- Pilar, what is it?
- I work two jobs.

27:22.852 --> 27:28.190
I get so tired, I take something to
stay awake. But I never bring it home.

27:30.192 --> 27:32.184
Are you nursing the baby?

27:34.987 --> 27:37.312
Pilar, do you nurse your baby?

27:39.033 --> 27:41.440
The drugs are in the breast milk.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.786
I love my baby.

27:50.626 --> 27:53.163
I would never hurt her.

27:53.587 --> 27:58.129
God forgive me, I would
never hurt her. I didn't know.

27:59.258 --> 28:01.630
Really, I didn't know.

28:03.178 --> 28:04.257
I didn't know.

28:07.682 --> 28:08.713
I didn't know.

28:09.016 --> 28:11.554
Mother, are you there?

28:12.102 --> 28:16.479
I'm involved in a case. I can't
make it for coffee, so page me.

28:16.690 --> 28:19.560
I completely forgot
to give you a message.

28:19.776 --> 28:23.524
Your mom's taken an earlier flight
and can't meet you.

28:23.737 --> 28:24.900
That's all?

28:28.575 --> 28:30.199
Are you all right?

28:30.410 --> 28:33.446
Are you keeping an eye
on that gunshot kid?

28:33.662 --> 28:37.873
I canceled a date with my mother,
but she stood me up first.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.743
That's parents for you.

28:40.418 --> 28:43.419
Get me Burch's lytes,
Davis' dig, Nguyen's coags.

28:43.629 --> 28:45.254
- You got it.
- How we doing?

28:45.464 --> 28:50.540
- Don't worry. I'm moving the meat.
- I've waited an hour for CT results.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.168
- I'm holding for it.
- Page Flint.

28:53.388 --> 28:56.341
Hold on, I can access his roto-viewer.

28:56.557 --> 28:59.890
- My patient needs morphine.
- I checked. He's asleep.

29:00.102 --> 29:02.675
Check again.
I don't want him in pain.

29:02.896 --> 29:05.766
- What happened?
- He was short of breath.

29:05.982 --> 29:08.935
- Why not call?
- You couldn't do anything.

29:09.151 --> 29:11.227
- It started when?
- Few days ago.

29:11.445 --> 29:14.231
Pulse ox 82. Decreased breath sounds.

29:14.406 --> 29:19.743
- It's probably just a chest cold.
- Move him, nice and easy.

29:19.952 --> 29:22.988
I'm not that sick! I can do it myself!

29:23.205 --> 29:27.581
- Do you want a blood gas?
- Yes, CBC, coags and a portable chest.

29:27.750 --> 29:30.917
I should've seen the doctor on Monday.

29:31.128 --> 29:33.998
Can you be quiet
and take a deep breath?

29:35.924 --> 29:38.960
- I think there's fluid in your lungs.
- You "think"?

29:39.177 --> 29:40.671
Lean forward.

29:41.846 --> 29:45.428
Fluid's halfway up.
Why did you wait so long?

29:45.641 --> 29:47.847
You could've passed out-

29:48.059 --> 29:51.262
- Don't scold me.
- We need to drain the fluid.

29:51.437 --> 29:52.600
What's wrong?

29:52.813 --> 29:55.434
Pleural effusion.
Needs a thoracentesis.

29:55.649 --> 29:59.812
He wants to stick a needle in me.
You're a surgeon. You do it.

30:00.028 --> 30:02.779
- That's a bad idea.
- I can handle this.

30:02.989 --> 30:05.775
He thinks a doctor
shouldn't treat family.

30:05.991 --> 30:11.032
- It's a simple procedure.
- I want Elizabeth to be my doctor.

30:12.789 --> 30:14.034
Fine.

30:16.417 --> 30:19.287
- Lizard guy's crashing.
- Why wasn't I told?

30:19.503 --> 30:21.163
He just went south.

30:24.048 --> 30:28.046
- His pressure's 60.
- Gila venom. Two liters of saline.

30:28.260 --> 30:32.127
- What do you need?
- .3 of epi and 50 of Benadryl.

30:32.305 --> 30:34.630
Here you go. Who's smoking?

30:34.849 --> 30:37.554
- I don't smell anything.
- It's out there.

30:37.768 --> 30:41.433
- That's my hernia patient.
- Tell him to smoke outside.

30:41.647 --> 30:44.813
Bad cocaine overdose.
Pressure's sky-high.

30:47.652 --> 30:50.652
- BP's 260/140.
- I've been waiting five hours.

30:50.821 --> 30:55.981
Get that cigarette out of here!
Start with Osmolal and phentolamine.

30:56.159 --> 30:58.828
There's a psych patient ready to jump.

30:58.995 --> 31:01.450
- Clear a trauma room.
- I'm on it.

31:01.664 --> 31:04.333
My patient's son wants to talk to you.

31:04.541 --> 31:07.495
- Want a Foley?
- Why ask me? Do it.

31:07.711 --> 31:11.245
- I can't get a second IV.
- Why? She has good veins.

31:11.464 --> 31:16.339
- How about my patient?
- I've got two patients. Deal with it.

31:16.510 --> 31:18.549
The guy just jumped!

31:21.472 --> 31:25.007
They said it was
a stage-four lung cancer.

31:26.143 --> 31:29.097
Doctors said it can't be
cut out or cured.

31:29.312 --> 31:33.855
Sometimes chemotherapy can shrink
the tumor and lengthen survival.

31:34.066 --> 31:37.898
- I know all about that.
- Are you interested?

31:38.487 --> 31:43.362
- Mark sure seems to be.
- What about you? What do you want?

31:44.909 --> 31:49.321
I want to live out the remainder
of my life as normal as I can.

31:50.038 --> 31:53.738
I don't wanna be hooked up
to a bunch of tubes, puking...

31:53.958 --> 31:57.659
...all for the sake
of a few extra miserable weeks.

31:58.963 --> 32:02.711
When we get the fluid off,
you'll feel a lot better.

32:04.342 --> 32:07.711
I'm gonna numb you up.
This will sting a bit.

32:07.929 --> 32:09.672
Ready when you are.

32:14.893 --> 32:18.262
- Stick around, fresh trauma coming in.
- Page Corday.

32:18.479 --> 32:21.184
- You doing okay?
- You late for something?

32:21.399 --> 32:22.857
I'll see you later.

32:23.067 --> 32:25.273
- Sorry about your patient.
- Which?

32:25.485 --> 32:28.818
Your belly tap in Curtain 3 expired.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.689
Why didn't anybody tell me?

32:31.908 --> 32:34.612
My patient dies, I'm the last to know.

32:34.827 --> 32:37.661
Pulse is weak.
Start two large-bore IVs.

32:37.871 --> 32:40.741
Decreased breath sounds.
Get a chest tube.

32:40.957 --> 32:43.874
- Want help?
- No thanks. What's he doing here?

32:44.085 --> 32:47.535
- It's a long story.
- Carter, everything okay?

32:47.754 --> 32:50.541
- How'd it happen?
- Psych patient jumped.

32:50.757 --> 32:54.042
- Looks like a few broken ribs.
- Get X-ray here.

32:55.594 --> 33:00.469
Hey, get the crash cart! Frank?
Airway's clear. He's breathing.

33:00.682 --> 33:03.351
- What happened?
- Probably vasovagalled.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.133
- Good pulse. We're okay.
- I'll get a BP.

33:06.354 --> 33:09.722
Gotta intubate.
Push 15 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.482
- Chest tube.
- I'll do it.

33:11.691 --> 33:14.811
- I got it. We gotta move fast.
- How can I help?

33:15.028 --> 33:16.142
Run the HemoCue.

33:16.362 --> 33:19.113
- Need a hand?
- No. Work on that HemoCue.

33:19.323 --> 33:23.106
- It's the nanny. The twins are crying.
- Take over for me.

33:23.285 --> 33:24.483
8-0 ET tube.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.372
I'm in a trauma. I can't do that now.

33:27.580 --> 33:30.153
- Ten blade and a Kelly.
- Check the cuff.

33:31.625 --> 33:33.499
- I can't.
- What's the pulse ox?

33:33.710 --> 33:35.868
It's 92.

33:36.087 --> 33:37.665
- We're okay.
- Okay.

33:37.881 --> 33:41.747
- Just put Kate's ear to the phone.
-32 French.

33:46.805 --> 33:48.844
You call that a lullaby?

33:50.808 --> 33:53.014
Give me cricoid pressure.

33:53.811 --> 33:56.099
Okay, I'm in. Let's bag him.

33:56.313 --> 33:59.266
O silk on a needle driver.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.857
Good breath sounds.

34:04.987 --> 34:06.860
Open the Xeroform.

34:07.406 --> 34:09.860
Hey, call Respiratory for a vent.

34:21.333 --> 34:23.576
You've had quite a day, huh?

34:24.504 --> 34:26.994
Randi, I'll be suturing in Exam 4.

34:27.172 --> 34:31.335
- I can pick up a few of your patients.
- Just take the new ones.

34:32.802 --> 34:36.585
- Oh, sorry, Carol. Pedes is full.
- These are my girls.

34:36.806 --> 34:39.842
- They've gotten so big.
- Is your nanny sick?

34:40.016 --> 34:43.266
She's new. They were fussy,
so she brought them.

34:43.478 --> 34:47.143
- They look content.
- They're always happy after nursing.

34:47.356 --> 34:50.523
- They miss their mom.
- We'll be in the lounge.

34:53.779 --> 34:55.570
Curtain 2 is going up.

34:55.780 --> 34:59.860
- Sorry to cause so much trouble.
- It's nothing. Feel better.

35:02.077 --> 35:05.528
- What's wrong with Super Nurse?
- He's being admitted.

35:05.747 --> 35:07.621
What, to the Psych ward?

35:07.832 --> 35:12.375
To Medicine. I diagnosed his
Addison's disease. He'll be fine soon.

35:12.545 --> 35:13.576
Good pickup.

35:13.796 --> 35:17.413
I'm gonna go up to the fifth floor,
keep him company.

35:19.134 --> 35:23.711
- Time of death, 21:37.
- I'll get the death kit.

35:24.889 --> 35:29.301
His organs could've saved many lives.
I couldn't do a thing.

35:29.517 --> 35:33.846
- You had no choice.
- Why couldn't they find his family?

35:34.063 --> 35:35.771
Probably a runaway.

35:35.981 --> 35:40.192
He's someone's son.
His parents don't even know he's here.

35:40.402 --> 35:42.145
They may never know.

35:43.613 --> 35:46.946
- Can you sign a discharge order?
- Which patient?

35:47.158 --> 35:50.075
- Dr. Greene's father.
- I'll be right out.

35:55.206 --> 35:57.827
You never said your father has cancer.

35:58.209 --> 36:03.166
He didn't want anybody to know. You
told him to follow up with Oncology?

36:03.380 --> 36:07.128
- He doesn't want to.
- Navelbine has no side effects.

36:07.341 --> 36:11.125
- It'll shrink the tumor.
- I've given him those options.

36:11.345 --> 36:15.294
It'll improve quality of life.
Talk to him. He'll listen.

36:15.765 --> 36:19.383
- It's his decision.
- Explain. He'll change his mind.

36:19.602 --> 36:24.347
- I have to respect his wishes.
- He's my father. I wanna help him.

36:24.564 --> 36:28.099
If you really want to help,
just be there for him.

36:30.695 --> 36:34.194
I won't just sit there
when there's more I can do.

36:34.615 --> 36:37.948
The patient donated his body
for educational use.

36:38.159 --> 36:39.618
For anatomy class?

36:39.828 --> 36:45.165
We often allow students to practice
procedures here on the fresh cadaver.

36:47.042 --> 36:51.668
Dr. Greene mentioned that you
needed work on your central lines.

36:54.965 --> 36:57.836
Put your finger in the sternal notch.

36:58.051 --> 37:02.796
Enter between the middle
and proximal third of the clavicle.

37:17.985 --> 37:21.733
- I'm sorry. I can't do this.
- You're doing fine.

37:25.950 --> 37:27.824
He was my patient.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.823
You want to stop?

37:38.711 --> 37:42.495
No. Why don't you take me through it?

37:42.923 --> 37:46.623
Aim just above and posterior
to your index finger.

37:56.101 --> 37:57.974
Crazy day, huh?

38:02.356 --> 38:06.852
- John, are you still in a lot of pain?
- It's not too bad.

38:07.069 --> 38:11.529
It seems like you're having a
hard time getting around in Trauma.

38:14.033 --> 38:15.361
I'm okay.

38:16.493 --> 38:19.031
The first day back can be rough.

38:19.204 --> 38:21.695
Every day gets a little bit easier.

38:25.501 --> 38:28.751
Have you talked to anybody
about what happened?

38:31.882 --> 38:36.128
- And your family's been supportive?
- Yeah, really, I'm okay.

38:37.303 --> 38:41.051
You might benefit from
the TENS unit or acupuncture.

38:41.223 --> 38:43.049
Thanks. I'll let you know.

38:55.735 --> 38:58.938
I need a PT/PTT on De Salvo.

39:01.073 --> 39:02.236
Heading home?

39:02.574 --> 39:05.777
I can take a cab
if you have other plans.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.746
Don't be ridiculous. We're going home.

39:12.249 --> 39:13.874
- Good night.
- Good night.

39:17.254 --> 39:22.496
- Your shoelaces are untied.
- I can't bend down after that needle.

39:30.223 --> 39:32.714
Don't fall and break your neck.

39:37.813 --> 39:41.098
From this angle. The one.
Just cut it in there.

39:41.274 --> 39:45.603
Just hit a little bit to the left.
And let it...

39:47.238 --> 39:51.484
- ... slide down.
- Too much thinking. I go by instinct.

39:52.158 --> 39:54.945
Do it your way. All right...

39:55.119 --> 39:58.120
...how about the six in the corner-

40:00.290 --> 40:02.662
Yeah, right. Here we go.

40:06.671 --> 40:10.253
- What about the laws of physics?
- You distracted me.

40:10.466 --> 40:12.090
Yeah. Excuse me.

40:15.261 --> 40:19.638
- You left me nothing.
- What? Go for the eleven.

40:20.057 --> 40:24.469
- Are you crazy? I can't make that.
- Of course you can. Come here.

40:24.644 --> 40:27.728
Just call it.
Eleven in the corner pocket.

40:28.147 --> 40:30.720
Just line it up.

40:31.734 --> 40:36.478
Now hit it to the right.
It'll slide right down the rail.

40:36.863 --> 40:41.489
- Trust me. Nice and easy.
- Trust you. All right.

40:44.828 --> 40:46.109
See?

40:46.371 --> 40:47.830
How's that?

40:49.791 --> 40:51.451
It's not bad.

40:57.339 --> 40:58.619
What?

41:21.651 --> 41:24.901
We'd have served
a late dinner for you.

41:25.113 --> 41:26.690
Soup's fine.

41:34.079 --> 41:36.534
- You're looking well, John.
- Thank you.

41:37.373 --> 41:39.615
I started back to work today.

41:41.210 --> 41:45.538
- Shouldn't you have more time off?
- I did okay.

41:51.302 --> 41:53.460
Actually, it was kind of tough.

41:53.679 --> 41:56.679
I didn't know if I'd
make it through the day.

41:57.932 --> 42:01.431
I felt, I don't know, afraid.

42:04.605 --> 42:08.104
- Afraid of what?
- That I couldn't handle it.

42:11.152 --> 42:12.729
But you did.

42:15.948 --> 42:19.779
I know we've had our disagreements
about your career.

42:20.493 --> 42:23.944
But I can see now
that medicine is what you love.

42:29.376 --> 42:34.286
When you were in high school,
you'd drop by unexpectedly.

42:34.505 --> 42:37.375
I'd make cocoa and we'd talk.

42:38.467 --> 42:40.210
I remember.

42:41.595 --> 42:44.216
We haven't done this in a long time.

42:45.556 --> 42:46.932
I know.

42:53.188 --> 42:56.852
- Where is that? Mammoth?
- No. Lake Tahoe.

42:57.066 --> 42:59.355
I lost $200 at the craps table.

42:59.568 --> 43:02.604
- Next slide.
- This is a fancy machine.

43:02.821 --> 43:06.688
Had I seen this one,
I wouldn't have fixed the old one.

43:06.908 --> 43:10.608
- San Diego?
- That was the Santa Barbara trip.

43:10.786 --> 43:12.114
You were 7.

43:13.205 --> 43:15.446
Taught you to swim underwater.

43:17.751 --> 43:22.163
Your mother never did like motels,
so we rented an RV.

43:24.131 --> 43:26.123
Planting the garden.

43:27.342 --> 43:31.256
- You used to make me pull the weeds.
- I did not.

43:31.471 --> 43:35.681
You remember you always wanted
to grow a watermelon tree?

43:35.891 --> 43:39.888
You planted the seeds you saved
