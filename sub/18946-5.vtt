Charlie's got his school report.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.879
It's brilliant.

00:26.879 --> 00:29.318
Shouldn't I be the one getting the kiss?

00:29.320 --> 00:31.239
We're switching things around this year.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.719
You get put in a box
and stored in the attic.

00:33.719 --> 00:36.079
With the others(!)

00:38.200 --> 00:40.759
A. A. A.

00:40.759 --> 00:42.079
He's got the Scouse hat trick.

00:42.079 --> 00:43.798
Hang on, what's this?

00:43.799 --> 00:46.478
"Miss Anstis, English, C."

00:46.479 --> 00:48.359
We don't want all As, do we?

00:48.359 --> 00:52.198
We don't want to have to start
doing a paternity test.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.439
"Despite reasonable grades,

00:53.439 --> 00:56.558
"I am concerned that Charlie is in danger
of becoming the class clown."

00:56.560 --> 01:00.639
Oh, ignore her. Miss Anstis is a bit...
uptight.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.829
We need to go and see her, find
out what Charlie has been up to.

01:02.853 --> 01:03.558
We?

01:03.560 --> 01:04.918
Schooling is usually my thing,

01:04.920 --> 01:07.998
like getting rid of spiders
and keeping the kids alive.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.638
I get involved in school stuff.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.358
I helped raise money with that cake stall.

01:11.359 --> 01:14.760
Helping is baking and selling,
not buying and eating.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.438
- I'm not kidding, Lucy.
- OK, fine.

01:18.439 --> 01:20.879
We'll go and pick up Charlie
together tomorrow and go and see

01:20.879 --> 01:23.838
Miss Anstis, but I'm telling
you now he's absolutely fine.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.478
Tell me that when he's living
under a bridge sniffing glue.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.039
I just about tolerate
those Haircut 100 albums,

01:29.039 --> 01:32.200
but will you please update
your drug references?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.478
I missed those little toilets.

01:42.479 --> 01:44.838
Oh, bring back memories of school days?

01:44.840 --> 01:47.918
No, I mean literally missed them.
It went everywhere.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.079
Yeah, all right!

01:49.079 --> 01:51.319
Have you tried to pee
and crouch at the same time?

01:51.319 --> 01:53.560
Yeah. I wonder what that must be like(!)

01:55.960 --> 01:58.840
Mum, I'm just going to see Izzy.

02:02.319 --> 02:03.918
That's sweet.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.838
Yeah, and yet when I do that to women...

02:06.840 --> 02:10.000
Right, come on, we need to get
to Florence Nightingale.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.158
The classrooms - they're all named
after British historical figures.

02:14.159 --> 02:17.959
What happened to classrooms
having numbers, and canes,

02:17.960 --> 02:20.878
and little piles of sawdust
covering up sick?

02:20.879 --> 02:22.759
Well, things have changed,

02:22.759 --> 02:26.038
which you'd have noticed if you were
a bit more involved in school life.

02:26.039 --> 02:27.399
I am involved.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.118
Excuse me, I'm looking
for my son's teacher, Miss Anstis.

02:30.120 --> 02:33.118
I am Miss Anstis.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.319
Sorry, didn't recognise you
without your... cakes.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.278
- Wait here. No messing about.
- OK.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.680
- I was talking to Charlie.
- Right.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.759 --> 02:58.520
I knew we shouldn't have touched
that bottle that said "drink me".

02:59.639 --> 03:01.558
So, er, Charlie's school report?

03:01.560 --> 03:03.519
I'm afraid Charlie does have a tendency

03:03.520 --> 03:05.598
to draw attention to himself.

03:05.599 --> 03:09.079
Today, for example, he disrupted
lessons by coughing.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.598
Coughing?

03:10.599 --> 03:13.318
She means on purpose, Lucy.
It's a classroom classic.

03:13.319 --> 03:14.759
They were doing that back in my day.

03:14.759 --> 03:18.199
Back in your day they probably had TB.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.239
Charlie was trying
to make the class laugh.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.519
He does that sort of thing a lot.

03:22.520 --> 03:26.000
Do you know what he called me
last week instead of Miss Anstis?

03:34.759 --> 03:37.560
Miss... Ant's Tits?

03:39.719 --> 03:42.679
No. He called me Morag.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.799
- Well, that's not nice.
- That's my name.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.558
Obviously he found out and decided
to say it for silly, comic effect,

03:50.560 --> 03:52.759
and I think it's disrespectful.

03:52.759 --> 03:55.680
Course it is, and just now when I said...

03:57.360 --> 03:59.478
...ant's tits.

03:59.479 --> 04:01.639
Just because your name sounds like...

04:01.639 --> 04:04.679
- Not saying you've got, you know...
- Fingers on lips.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.759
I've tried to explain to Charlie

04:06.759 --> 04:08.759
that it'll be him
that suffers in the long run.

04:08.759 --> 04:13.199
Course it will, Miss AnSTIS.

04:13.199 --> 04:16.879
For instance, we're about to be
visited by the children's author

04:16.879 --> 04:19.879
Johnny Lucas for a storytelling contest.

04:19.879 --> 04:22.798
Each class selects
a child to read a story.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.238
The winning school gets
£1,000 worth of books

04:25.240 --> 04:28.158
and the winning child
gets a trip to Legoland.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.959
I was considering Charlie
to read for our class.

04:30.959 --> 04:33.278
Oh, that's great.

04:33.279 --> 04:36.319
As I say... WAS.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.838
I'm afraid Charlie's story
just went for cheap laughs

04:38.840 --> 04:41.759
and was entirely inappropriate.

04:41.759 --> 04:44.558
Perhaps I should read a little bit to you.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.439
I must warn you,
the language is very vivid

04:47.439 --> 04:49.718
and you may deem it
unsuitable for a child.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.120
Oh, well, at least he's written a warning.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.119
"'Hooray, ' cried the little boy,

04:59.120 --> 05:02.399
"as the witch was bludgeoned to death
when the woodsman smashed up

05:02.399 --> 05:06.959
"her stupid, ugly, smelly face
that looked like a cow's bum."

05:10.560 --> 05:13.598
"Bludgeoned." That's a good word.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.559
"Then the little boy took
the woodsman's axe and chopped

05:16.560 --> 05:20.559
"the stupid witch's stinky,
old, fat, blobby body up

05:20.560 --> 05:23.678
"and put her in the pot of boiling water."

05:23.680 --> 05:25.600
I blame Heston Blumenthal.

05:27.399 --> 05:32.238
"One by one he threw the bleeding
body parts into the cauldron."

05:32.240 --> 05:35.119
Cauldron spelled with two Os.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.439
"First he threw in her fat arms,

05:37.439 --> 05:41.038
"then he threw in her horrible
hairy legs, then he threw in her

05:41.040 --> 05:43.478
"stinky, slimy intestines,

05:43.480 --> 05:46.800
"and her massively monstrous butt cheeks.

05:48.959 --> 05:52.000
"Then, finally, he threw in...

05:53.279 --> 05:55.600
"her foo-foo."

06:00.600 --> 06:03.120
How many Os in foo-foo?

06:08.639 --> 06:11.199
OK, look, so his story was a bit
rough around the edges,

06:11.199 --> 06:13.158
but he's seven. He's not TS Eliot.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.199
I know he's not. I'm not an idiot.

06:15.199 --> 06:17.680
No-one expects him to be as good as her.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.319
Didn't you hear it?

06:20.319 --> 06:22.559
Chopping up her gizzards
and cutting off her legs?

06:22.560 --> 06:24.399
Who cares? She's a witch.

06:24.399 --> 06:26.639
It's not like he kidnapped
the local choirgirl,

06:26.639 --> 06:29.918
put cigarettes out on her arms,
then buried her in a shallow grave.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.119
Where does Charlie get his dark side from?

06:33.120 --> 06:36.519
Look, are you bothered that he's trying
to be the class clown?

06:36.519 --> 06:40.159
What about the, you know, foo-foo?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.879
OK, maybe that was a bit silly,

06:43.879 --> 06:46.439
but it's our fault for teaching
him such childish words.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.838
Yeah, let's teach him
some adult terms for it,

06:48.840 --> 06:50.840
then he can start doing stag dos(!)

06:52.040 --> 06:53.718
Half the world's got one, Lee.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.439
Why is society so scared
of it when we talk about it?

06:56.439 --> 06:59.038
The problem is we live
in a patriarchal society.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.879
- Bollocks.
- See? You don't mind mentioning those.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.079
A Nancy?

07:14.079 --> 07:16.920
You are a doctor and you call it a Nancy?

07:20.319 --> 07:22.238
It's my parents' fault.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.319
They were a bit Victorian
in their attitudes.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.918
As far as they were concerned,
it was called a Nancy.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.879
It was a terrible thing
full of teeth and monsters.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.360
Still, at least I was prepared
when I met Anna.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.718
Bet you never mucked
about at school, did you?

07:38.720 --> 07:40.119
Oh, I wouldn't have dared.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.918
It was a boarding school.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.038
Cold showers and ritual beatings.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.319
Yeah, but look where it got you.

07:46.319 --> 07:51.040
Yeah, married to Anna - cold
showers and ritual beatings.

07:53.360 --> 07:58.278
I mean, you've got a really good job.
I bet your Jack toes the line.

07:58.279 --> 08:00.639
He'll end up doing a really important job,

08:00.639 --> 08:04.240
like Prime Minister or TV weatherman.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.999
You've got quite a limited idea
of important jobs, haven't you?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.759
Stop worrying. What's so wrong
about being a bit of a class clown?

08:13.759 --> 08:16.639
Because I don't want him to end up like...

08:16.639 --> 08:17.350
Well, like me.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.478
I thought you were proud
of your background?

08:19.480 --> 08:23.439
School of hard knocks. Ferret
and dripping for breakfast.

08:23.439 --> 08:26.478
O-levels in greyhound management.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.319
I didn't get any O-levels, actually.

08:28.319 --> 08:30.199
Whilst you were
off to your fancy university,

08:30.199 --> 08:34.359
hobnobbing with the toffs, I went
to work in a biscuit factory.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.960
Well, you were sort of hobnobbing.

08:39.639 --> 08:43.519
Look, why don't you sit
down with Lucy and tell her in a calm

08:43.519 --> 08:47.959
and sensible way that you're worried
that Charlie might end up like you?

08:47.960 --> 08:52.239
As soon as she imagines
that apocalyptic scenario,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.440
she'll have to see sense.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.039
So what did you call a Nancy
when you were growing up?

09:04.759 --> 09:06.798
Well, I don't know
about your other O-levels,

09:06.799 --> 09:09.080
but I can see why you failed biology.

09:18.519 --> 09:19.999
What's in the box?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.078
I've been up in the attic to get
some of my old school reports.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.359
Can you come and sit
next to me for a minute?

09:25.360 --> 09:27.799
Why, is there a spider in there?

09:31.519 --> 09:35.479
This is the report I got
when I was Charlie's age.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.798
Read the summary on the final page.

09:37.799 --> 09:41.838
"Sooner or later Lee will learn
that joking around will get him nowhere."

09:41.840 --> 09:45.599
So? We all went through a cheeky
phase at school.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.840
I sometimes used to use a blue
pen instead of a black one.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.119
And this was two years later.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.678
"Lee is a mediocre student
with a mediocre future.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.158
"I look forward to the day
when his unamusing antics are

09:58.159 --> 10:00.958
"a burden to someone else."

10:00.960 --> 10:03.599
And this was when I was 15.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.678
- This isn't a school report.
- Exactly.

10:05.679 --> 10:08.278
It's my clocking-in card
from the biscuit factory.

10:08.279 --> 10:10.558
I wondered why it had jam on it.

10:10.559 --> 10:12.359
That's not jam.

10:12.360 --> 10:17.278
It's blood, from the wearing down of me
fingers as I toiled for hours

10:17.279 --> 10:19.958
on a very tiny wage,
in the brutal, harsh conditions

10:19.960 --> 10:22.078
of a Northern factory.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.120
- It's jam, isn't it?
- Yes, it's jam, but the point is...

10:26.919 --> 10:30.479
...I'd ruined any chance
of a future all by the age of 15,

10:30.480 --> 10:34.038
just by mucking around and I do NOT
want that to happen to Charlie.

10:34.039 --> 10:35.559
No.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.999
Oh, maybe you're right.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.340
I think we should sit
down and talk to him.

10:41.365 --> 10:42.144
OK.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.318
Charlie is always saying, "When
I grow up I want to be like me dad."

10:47.320 --> 10:50.320
And I've told him, "Sorry,
son, you can't do both."

10:57.519 --> 10:59.519
You're not in trouble, Charlie.

10:59.519 --> 11:00.719
Course not.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.239
We just want to know why
you're being silly at school.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.159
Cos you're bored in class?

11:07.879 --> 11:10.678
Is it because you like being funny?

11:10.679 --> 11:14.599
When she said class clown I didn't
realise she meant Marcel Marceau.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.918
Maybe you're mucking about because

11:16.919 --> 11:19.320
you want someone
in particular to like you?

11:21.360 --> 11:24.318
Izzy, maybe?

11:24.320 --> 11:28.798
Mucking about is not how you
impress girls, Charlie. Trust me.

11:28.799 --> 11:31.879
You don't want to end up like...

11:31.879 --> 11:35.479
like a boy that was at my school.

11:35.480 --> 11:39.158
He was the class joker,
until he got suspended.

11:39.159 --> 11:41.153
- Suspended?
- What did he do?

11:41.177 --> 11:42.879
Yeah, what did he do?

11:42.879 --> 11:46.120
Well, this... boy...

11:47.960 --> 11:49.698
...was in science class

11:49.720 --> 11:52.719
and he was supposed
to do a big presentation

11:52.720 --> 11:56.039
about... flammable gases.

11:57.679 --> 12:03.038
But instead of just reading
out what he was supposed to read,

12:03.039 --> 12:07.438
he decided to muck
about and do a sort of...

12:07.440 --> 12:09.719
practical experiment.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.479
What do you mean?

12:11.480 --> 12:14.119
Well, it just so happens
he had a Zippo lighter

12:14.120 --> 12:16.639
and a bellyful of baked beans.

12:16.639 --> 12:20.239
He lit his fart! That's SOOO cool!

12:20.240 --> 12:25.479
No, Charlie, it is not cool,
especially given what happened.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.958
What?

12:26.960 --> 12:29.919
Put it this way, there was more...

12:31.279 --> 12:32.959
...solid than gas.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.239
Urgh!

12:35.240 --> 12:37.838
- Not cool.
- Exactly.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.918
The point is, this kid,
he had a lot of potential.

12:41.919 --> 12:45.158
He could have done so many things,

12:45.159 --> 12:48.918
but instead he ended up ruining his life

12:48.919 --> 12:51.678
and his trousers.

12:51.679 --> 12:54.719
I'm sorry that happened to you, Dad.

12:54.720 --> 12:58.198
What? I'm not talking about me.
It wasn't me.

12:58.200 --> 13:02.000
Dad, I'm seven. I'm not a moron.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.519
You don't have to be embarrassed...

13:07.120 --> 13:10.559
- ...just because you pooed your pants.
- Please stop talking.

13:12.399 --> 13:15.839
The point is, there are other
ways to impress girls,

13:15.840 --> 13:18.799
like being chosen to read
a story to a famous author.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.759
Look, we just want you to be
happy, son, because we love you.

13:24.759 --> 13:27.999
OK, Dad, from now on I'm going
to do my best to be good.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.320
Good lad, Charlie.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.798
We've been married
for quite a few years now,

13:37.799 --> 13:41.200
but what you did just then,
what you told Charlie...

13:43.440 --> 13:47.039
...is the most disgusting
thing I've ever heard!

14:04.919 --> 14:07.038
I was hoping to catch you.

14:07.039 --> 14:10.038
I'm not sure what it is you said
to Charlie, but over the last few days

14:10.039 --> 14:12.879
he's shown a marked
improvement in his behaviour.

14:12.879 --> 14:16.278
I even insisted he write a brand-new
story, and I'm pleased to inform you

14:16.279 --> 14:22.198
that it contains no unnecessary
language, or female genitalia.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.719
Oh, well, there goes the Channel 4 deal.

14:25.720 --> 14:29.038
In fact, as a reward for such
a turnaround in his behaviour,

14:29.039 --> 14:31.798
I've selected Charlie as class
representative to read

14:31.799 --> 14:33.599
to our visiting author.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.240
Oh, my God! That's fantastic!

14:38.000 --> 14:43.198
Isabella Jenkins, young ladies
do not lick boys' faces.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.679
Yeah. Get him to buy you a drink first.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.918
Izzy has got a new friend, Jake McKenzie.

14:55.919 --> 14:57.719
She thinks I'm boring now.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.278
Well, she's not going to think
that when she sees you on that stage

15:00.279 --> 15:02.359
reading a story to Johnny Lucas, is she?

15:02.360 --> 15:04.599
The new story isn't
as funny as the other one.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.639
I'm sure it's brilliant.

15:06.639 --> 15:10.359
- In fact, why don't you read it to us now?
- Yeah, good idea.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.759
It'll be like a rehearsal for the big day.

15:15.519 --> 15:19.278
"Once upon a time there was a little boy
who met a witch and the

15:19.279 --> 15:21.791
"witch was very naughty,
even though she knew

15:21.816 --> 15:23.318
it was wrong to be naughty.

15:23.320 --> 15:26.479
"The little boy was very good
and always helped his mother with

15:26.480 --> 15:30.678
"the dishes, never ate sweets
or watched violent cartoons.

15:30.679 --> 15:33.000
"One day the boy was walking
through the woods...

15:34.320 --> 15:37.719
"...so the witch was told
that for hygiene reasons she must

15:37.720 --> 15:42.318
"always wash her hands thoroughly,
especially after using the bathroom,

15:42.320 --> 15:45.599
"so she washed them and also
made sure not to splash water

15:45.600 --> 15:47.679
"on the floor when she dried her hands...

15:49.240 --> 15:52.798
"...and the witch and the woodsman
got married and lived in the cottage

15:52.799 --> 15:55.798
"and she promised to never
be naughty ever again

15:55.799 --> 15:58.440
"and they lived happily ever after.
The end."

16:00.440 --> 16:02.038
I said, "The end."

16:02.039 --> 16:04.918
Oh, what a fantastic story, son.

16:04.919 --> 16:08.879
You don't think it's a bit... boring?

16:08.879 --> 16:11.558
No.

16:11.559 --> 16:16.918
- Izzy is going to think you are so cool.
- OK, if you say so.

16:16.919 --> 16:19.558
Right, who wants to watch YouTube
videos of old people falling

16:19.559 --> 16:21.798
down escalators?

16:21.799 --> 16:25.080
No, it's OK. I'm going to tidy my room.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.359
Oh, he's probably just a bit tired.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.078
Funnily enough, I'm not.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.399
Must have been that refreshing
ten-minute nap I had

16:35.399 --> 16:37.320
during that story.

16:49.039 --> 16:50.999
- Hello?
- 'Where the hell are you?'

16:51.000 --> 16:54.719
- His reading starts in about ten minutes.
- Anna's stuck in traffic.

16:54.720 --> 16:58.599
What do you want me to do, leave
our five-year-old twins on their own?

16:58.600 --> 17:01.759
No, Lee, that was a rhetorical question.

17:01.759 --> 17:05.039
- How's Charlie?
- Moping around like Morrissey on Mogadon.

17:06.440 --> 17:10.397
Look, I'll get there
as soon as I can, OK? Bye.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.719
The twins let me in.
I could have been anyone.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.719
I could have been an axe murderer.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.598
You still might. Don't give up the dream.

17:17.598 --> 17:19.117
Oh, Anna, look at this.

17:19.118 --> 17:22.117
Lee wrote it when we first
started going out properly.

17:22.118 --> 17:25.199
"Roses are red, violets are purples,

17:25.200 --> 17:28.680
"If I give you a quid will you
show me your nurples?"

17:31.480 --> 17:34.598
What are nurples?

17:34.599 --> 17:36.439
You've got two of them.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.640
En-suite bathrooms?

17:40.160 --> 17:44.278
Lee is so hard on himself,
and on Charlie, but you know what?

17:44.279 --> 17:47.038
It was Lee's joking around all the time

17:47.039 --> 17:50.159
that made me like him in the first place.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.919
Well, I didn't think it
was his good looks, or his job

17:53.920 --> 17:57.079
or his taste in clothes or his breath.

17:58.759 --> 18:01.519
This is no fun if you don't join in.

18:02.759 --> 18:05.920
I've got to go. Thanks, Anna.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.119
So immature.

18:16.799 --> 18:19.199
Show starts in five minutes.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.278
Just because this
is extra-curriculum doesn't mean

18:21.279 --> 18:23.558
that I'll tolerate tardiness.

18:23.559 --> 18:25.919
Is my story really good, Dad?

18:25.920 --> 18:28.838
Course it is, son. You're
going to take the roof off.

18:28.839 --> 18:30.999
Like grandad did to that church

18:31.000 --> 18:34.398
when he got in trouble with the police?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.480
Good luck, son.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.278
Oops, busted. Want one?

18:45.279 --> 18:48.038
No, I'm all right, thanks. Never my thing.

18:48.039 --> 18:50.358
I used to have a much more
disgusting habit as a teenager

18:50.359 --> 18:53.719
but I'm down to ten-a-day now.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.598
Johnny. Johnny Lucas.

18:55.599 --> 18:57.358
Oh, right. The author.

18:57.359 --> 18:59.679
You looking forward to judging
what the kids have written?

18:59.680 --> 19:02.038
Honestly? Not really, no.

19:02.039 --> 19:04.358
No, these kids' stories
are always so bloody boring.

19:04.359 --> 19:07.038
Sometimes I think some of these
teachers are just knocking

19:07.039 --> 19:08.358
all the fun out of them, you know?

19:08.359 --> 19:10.798
It's like the kids have lost
the art of just being silly.

19:10.799 --> 19:13.519
Yeah, but being silly doesn't
get you anywhere, does it?

19:13.519 --> 19:14.679
Well, I don't know.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.519
It's all I've ever done, muck
around, write silly stories.

19:17.519 --> 19:19.759
Not done me any harm.

19:19.759 --> 19:23.719
Even got me this - a key
to a Bentley Continental.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.598
Should write another book. You
might get the actual car.

19:27.599 --> 19:31.480
Oh, gotta go. Old Morag looks
like a right ball-breaker, eh?

19:34.440 --> 19:36.959
Oh, thank God.
I've been thinking about Charlie.

19:36.983 --> 19:37.798
Me too.

19:37.799 --> 19:40.199
- Being silly, it's not all bad, is it?
- No.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.959
It's what attracted me to you
in the first place, you know,

19:42.960 --> 19:44.598
the daft jokes.

19:44.599 --> 19:48.798
- Not the good looks and the charm, then?
- See, that kind of thing.

19:48.799 --> 19:52.239
Will all parents please
take their seats now?

19:52.240 --> 19:55.838
- Come on, then. Let's get this over with.
- Hang on.

19:55.839 --> 19:58.358
Our baby boy is about to go on stage
and tell the most boring story

19:58.359 --> 20:00.078
since your mum thought she had shingles

20:00.079 --> 20:02.838
but it turned out to be the wicker chair.

20:02.839 --> 20:04.920
So, what can we do?

20:06.480 --> 20:08.358
I know.

20:08.359 --> 20:09.878
If you're using the toilets again

20:09.880 --> 20:12.038
would you please be
more careful this time?

20:12.039 --> 20:14.799
Our caretaker was mopping for hours!

20:27.079 --> 20:30.078
Mate, I'm looking
for a classroom called, um...

20:30.079 --> 20:31.558
Oh, what's it called?

20:31.559 --> 20:34.919
You know, woman, nice to soldiers.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.880
I want to say Joanna Lumley.

20:38.279 --> 20:41.239
Oh, forget it.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.199
Right, now, this is storytelling,

20:43.200 --> 20:45.078
and I want you to bring
these stories to life,

20:45.079 --> 20:47.038
and you are the audience.

20:47.039 --> 20:50.759
So if you want to laugh, laugh.
If you want to cry, cry.

20:50.759 --> 20:53.558
And, remember, one lucky little brat
is going to get a free trip

20:53.559 --> 20:56.199
to Legoland, and that's not fair
on the rest of you, is it, yeah?

20:56.200 --> 20:58.640
So if you don't like it,
give 'em hell, yeah?

21:00.319 --> 21:02.558
Just kidding, you know.

21:02.559 --> 21:05.199
Just, er, let's try and keep
it fairly sensible.

21:05.200 --> 21:08.049
Now, before we start,
who'd like to hear a poem about poo?

21:08.075 --> 21:09.023
Yeah!

21:16.839 --> 21:18.598
Oh, God.

21:18.599 --> 21:21.078
"'Zap, zap' went the alien warship,

21:21.079 --> 21:24.999
"as the space captain steered
through the astro-belt.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.358
"Would the alien fleet capture
this heroic spaceman,

21:28.359 --> 21:30.439
"torture him and kill him?"

21:30.440 --> 21:32.880
We can but hope.

21:54.599 --> 21:56.960
Jake McKenzie?

22:08.359 --> 22:13.638
"Trapped in quicksand.
Quick, grab that vine."

22:13.640 --> 22:16.920
(Charlie. Charlie.)

22:18.079 --> 22:20.159
Indoor voices!

22:20.160 --> 22:22.239
Where did you get that?

22:22.240 --> 22:26.039
I just found it... in your desk.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.880
Look, what if I Tippex over the foo-foo?

22:32.039 --> 22:34.558
My boy is about to walk
out there and humiliate himself

22:34.559 --> 22:38.798
by telling a really, really boring story.

22:38.799 --> 22:40.078
Charlie's a good kid.

22:40.079 --> 22:44.199
OK, sometimes he's a bit silly,
but that's not always a bad thing.

22:44.200 --> 22:48.239
Don't let him walk on that stage
and make a fool of himself.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.960
Please, I am begging you.

23:05.400 --> 23:09.000
I hope Ofsted downgrade
you to "satisfactory".

23:11.200 --> 23:16.960
Now, next up we have Florence
Nightingale class and it's Charlie.

23:25.359 --> 23:30.919
"Once upon a time there was a little boy
who met a witch and the witch

23:30.920 --> 23:35.719
"was very naughty, even though she knew
it was wrong to be naughty."

23:35.720 --> 23:38.318
Boo!

23:38.319 --> 23:40.199
Sorry.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.598
"The little boy was very good,
and always helped his mother with

23:43.599 --> 23:47.598
"the dishes, and never ate sweets
or watched violent cartoons."

23:47.599 --> 23:50.199
Boring!

23:50.200 --> 23:54.880
"One day the boy was walking
through the woods and he met a woodsman."

23:57.640 --> 24:03.118
"And the woodsman told the boy
all about endangered wildlife

24:03.119 --> 24:08.239
"and about how certain
flowers have gone extinct

24:08.240 --> 24:11.919
"and that people should start
putting their litter in the bin."

24:11.920 --> 24:15.439
Get off!

24:15.440 --> 24:18.279
Right, that's it.

24:26.480 --> 24:30.159
"They asked the witch
if she wanted to be their friend

24:30.160 --> 24:33.638
"so they shouted
over to the witch and said..."

24:33.640 --> 24:36.000
Hello, witchy, you manky
grotbag of pig's wee!

24:43.240 --> 24:45.559
What are you doing here?

24:46.559 --> 24:49.160
What are you doing here, "Woodsman"?

24:51.319 --> 24:54.159
What are you doing here, Woodsman?

24:54.160 --> 24:57.439
Don't you remember? The witch
was full of useful advice.

24:57.440 --> 25:00.038
She said it's important
to be a good little boy,

25:00.039 --> 25:04.798
but it's also important to be
yourself and have a sense of humour.

25:04.799 --> 25:07.798
And the little boy thought,
"Yes, the witch is right,"

25:07.799 --> 25:11.038
and so he asked his daddy to come
on stage and cause trouble

25:11.039 --> 25:14.679
at the book reading the boy
was doing at his school.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.398
(Finally, a bit of theatre.)

25:16.400 --> 25:17.759
And the dad said, "No chance.

25:17.759 --> 25:20.078
"I'm not getting on stage
and making a fool of myself,

25:20.079 --> 25:23.679
"just so you can win a trip to Legoland

25:23.680 --> 25:26.679
"..and there's nothing you can do about it

25:26.680 --> 25:30.920
"even if you do know a witch
with magical powers."

25:32.519 --> 25:35.638
Oh.

25:35.640 --> 25:39.278
And so the wicked witch waved her
wand and said to the woodsman,

25:39.279 --> 25:41.278
"You're totally under my power."

25:41.279 --> 25:43.038
"Oh, no," said the woodsman,

25:43.039 --> 25:45.398
"I hope you're not going to make
me do anything stupid."

25:45.400 --> 25:48.999
And then the wicked witch
cast a spell on the woodsman

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
and suddenly he was hopping
about on one leg...

25:59.519 --> 26:01.598
...which the woodsman found easy.

26:01.599 --> 26:04.920
Not so easy when the witch
made his trousers fall down.

26:12.599 --> 26:16.838
Then the wicked, evil
witch cast another spell

26:16.839 --> 26:21.680
and suddenly the woodsman was doing
an impression of a chicken.

26:26.039 --> 26:28.798
And the woodsman reminded
the boy that he had an axe

26:28.799 --> 26:30.880
so not to push it.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.838
And then the witch made the woodsman...

26:35.839 --> 26:38.480
set fire to his fart.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.159
Now this I've got see.

26:46.160 --> 26:49.598
Ah, yes, but unfortunately
the woodsman had nothing to use

26:49.599 --> 26:52.878
as a flame, so that idea
was immediately abandoned.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.440
Here you go, woodsman.

27:18.519 --> 27:20.240
Oh, God!

27:40.599 --> 27:42.798
I think you may have just
won yourself £1,000 worth

27:42.799 --> 27:45.079
of library books. Bravo!

27:46.880 --> 27:48.959
More!

27:48.960 --> 27:51.039
No.

28:00.359 --> 28:03.239
Well, that was certainly
a memorable performance,

28:03.240 --> 28:05.919
especially for Jake in the front row.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.400
I think you singed
the poor boy's eyebrows.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.398
Are you still sulking?

28:11.400 --> 28:14.439
I can't believe that Charlie is taking
Izzy to Legoland and not me.

28:14.440 --> 28:17.920
I helped him win, at the risk
of blowing my own trumpet.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.959
Still, they all lived happily ever after.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.679
The end.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.640
Well done.

28:27.359 --> 28:29.919
It's important that he listens
to his teachers, but we have to

28:29.920 --> 28:32.558
make sure we also don't forget
he's a normal seven-year-old.

28:32.559 --> 28:36.200
Exactly, and we have
to let him act like one.

28:41.559 --> 28:43.199
Can you smell matches?

28:43.200 --> 28:44.960
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

28:45.305 --> 28:51.946
