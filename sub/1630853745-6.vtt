WEBVTT

00:04.212 --> 00:05.588
I miss you.

00:06.756 --> 00:07.924
Natalya’s really gorgeous.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.259
Aussies are my kryptonite.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.722
I don’t know if it’s just
this boat romance

00:13.763 --> 00:16.558
or if it’s blossoming
into something else.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.186
Three meters, getting closer.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.688
Oh sh--,
that’s not three meters.

00:21.730 --> 00:22.731
She’s gonna hit it, man.

00:22.772 --> 00:25.900
We’re gonna hit.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.527
Jesus Christ.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.988
I need to be able to have
a bosun to lead a team,

00:30.030 --> 00:31.573
so I’m letting you go.

00:37.203 --> 00:40.206
I get on with Tash
like a house on fire.

00:40.248 --> 00:43.251
My asshole burns.
My asshole’s like...

00:49.674 --> 00:52.260
Storm is stepping in as a
provisional bosun.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.887
He’s gonna show me
what he’s got.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.722
It’s been a dream of mine
to obviously become a bosun.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.766
And then our
new deckhand arrives

00:57.807 --> 00:58.933
the first day of charter.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.560
-How you doing?
-Nice to see you.

01:00.602 --> 01:04.230
On our last boat, me and Tash,
we got together.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.568
She was still
with her boyfriend,

01:08.610 --> 01:11.404
but she wanted to be with me.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.573
Mm-hmm.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.785
My exes cheated on me, but
it’s not right to cheat back.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.456
I feel betrayed.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.458
Now it’s making me look
like a ----ing idiot.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.175
If you do it again,
you’re fired.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.219
I want you guys
to move cabins now.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.221
I feel like I’ve betrayed you.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.098
I’m obviously very hurt.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.766
I don’t know this person,

01:39.808 --> 01:43.770
I don’t recognize him, and
we work together constantly.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.189
Hopefully he’ll never
do this ever again.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.805
I think there might be a cabin
swap happening today.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.685
It’s happening now.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.815
She’s not going to?

02:34.738 --> 02:36.364
So, you...
that’s what I was gonna say.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.365
So, you guys are gonna swap?

02:37.407 --> 02:38.366
-Yeah.
-Okay, cool.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.784
I don’t have a choice.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.286
Like, they can’t be
sleeping together...

02:41.327 --> 02:42.287
like, in the same room.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.205
-No.
-Shoot, man.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.206
Anyways, let’s bust this out.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.416
All right, buddy.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.210
I did get
most of me out.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.712
I think these are all yours.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.381
I don’t ever wear these,
can I put them somewhere?

02:53.423 --> 02:57.552
I’ll find out if someone
needs some shoes.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.431
Having to move cabins, it’s
kind of like a walk of shame.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.726
The whole time of me trying
to hide this secret

03:04.768 --> 03:08.355
was because I didn’t want
it to disrupt the crew,

03:08.396 --> 03:10.398
I didn’t want it to
cause any drama,

03:10.440 --> 03:12.776
and essentially,
it’s just made things worse.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.570
I’m gonna take half of my
sh-- out of my room now.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.534
I feel like it’s all over now,

03:21.576 --> 03:23.620
and I feel bad
for what I’ve done,

03:23.661 --> 03:26.206
but I’m super disappointed
in myself.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.417
It’s a sh-- feeling.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.543
So, how are you?

03:30.585 --> 03:32.712
I just have to move on.

03:32.754 --> 03:36.466
I don’t know, prove to myself

03:36.508 --> 03:39.386
and to everyone else
that I can do this,

03:39.427 --> 03:40.637
regardless of what’s happened.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.639
Most importantly to yourself.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.058
Through your darkest times
and your happiest moments,

03:45.100 --> 03:47.060
I’m honestly here for you.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.228
Aw.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.854
I’m dead-ass serious about that.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.027
I don’t even know where to
begin with sh-- like this.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.241
<i>Storm, David, Natasha,</i>

04:01.282 --> 04:03.827
let’s meet in the crew mess for
a preference sheet meeting.

04:03.868 --> 04:04.994
On my way.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.539
-Dave?
-Are you okay?

04:11.292 --> 04:12.836
No.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.463
No.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.095
Right, charter number three.

04:22.137 --> 04:25.265
-Yay!
-Yes.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.142
Kristina Rosette is
a real estate agent

04:27.183 --> 04:28.977
in the Bay Area looking
to celebrate

04:29.019 --> 04:31.146
a joint fiftieth birthday party
with her cousin, Dina.

04:31.187 --> 04:35.233
Kristina and Dina are requesting
a dual birthday celebration

04:35.275 --> 04:36.776
and prefer their cake

04:36.818 --> 04:39.404
to be delivered by
a shirtless deckhand.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.822
Hundred percent Mzi.

04:40.864 --> 04:41.990
[sneezes]

04:42.032 --> 04:43.616
For the final night of charter,

04:43.658 --> 04:46.953
the group would like
to have a Studio 54 party

04:46.995 --> 04:48.038
with glitter décor.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.497
Yes!
So excited for that.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.167
These ladies have a
high threshold for adventure

04:52.208 --> 04:53.710
and are aiming to spend
as much time

04:53.752 --> 04:56.087
with the water toys as possible.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.797
We’re gonna flood the back.

04:57.839 --> 04:58.965
Thank you.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.383
It’s gonna be an
adventure land for them.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.344
I’ve never been a bosun before,

05:02.385 --> 05:05.138
but Sandy feels
that she can entrust

05:05.180 --> 05:07.182
this provisional title on me.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.310
It’s exciting,
and it’s nerve-wracking.

05:10.352 --> 05:13.104
I will give 250 percent
from the moment

05:13.146 --> 05:14.731
I wake up till the moment
I go to sleep.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.066
What kind of cake you thinking?

05:16.107 --> 05:18.026
I’ll do, like,
a three-tier one,

05:18.068 --> 05:19.819
do a massive one,
like a wedding cake.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.571
Like a vanilla?

05:21.613 --> 05:23.865
I’ll do, like, classic
vanilla sponge.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.867
Yeah, they both
like vanilla cake.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.660
In the past I’ve had couples.

05:27.702 --> 05:31.373
I’ve had two that
turned out in a very good way,

05:31.414 --> 05:34.668
and the other 20 were not.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.045
David and Natasha
are demonstrating

05:37.087 --> 05:38.380
their professionalism right now.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.923
They’re both excellent
at their craft,

05:39.964 --> 05:41.758
and they’ve been doing
this a long time.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.593
I think they can do this.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.387
So, let’s have an awesome
charter tomorrow.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.847
-Yep.
-Get a good night’s sleep

05:47.889 --> 05:50.600
I’ve only got, like, 30 more
shirts to iron, thank God.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.863
I think that’s it.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.115
All right, well,
that’s everyone’s laundry

06:05.156 --> 06:06.700
done for the next year.

06:06.741 --> 06:07.659
Ah!

06:08.868 --> 06:10.829
Did you just say,
"Kyle is a Hawaiian?"

06:17.419 --> 06:18.712
Is that your favorite?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.255
-Ah!
-Are you ticklish?

06:20.296 --> 06:23.508
How can you have foot
massages if you’re ticklish?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.719
I’ve never had good experiences
with boyfriends.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.722
So, I have got trust issues,

06:28.763 --> 06:31.141
but with Storm, we’re
a little bit romantic.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.601
I don’t know what’s happening,
I don’t know what’s happening.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.275
-A what?
-I’ve got a big day.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.401
No, I said...

06:41.443 --> 06:42.902
[laughing]

06:42.944 --> 06:44.863
Do you wanna hear the
waterfalls, babe?

06:44.904 --> 06:46.781
What waterfalls?

06:48.616 --> 06:50.076
It’s Niagara Falls, hon.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.453
Oh, so...

06:53.371 --> 06:55.373
Oh sh--, was that your...
did I put it in your cupboard?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.833
-Dude, you’re good, bro.
-Sorry.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.877
Dave’s been having
a really tough day.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.045
I feel for him.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.588
Granted, I probably
would feel different

07:01.629 --> 07:03.214
if I know the whole story.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.217
Even though we might have
been off to a rocky start...

07:06.259 --> 07:08.303
No, don’t touch me.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.971
Me and Dave are cool.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.349
But now that we’re roommates,
like, mind your business,

07:12.390 --> 07:17.979
stay clean, don’t use Axe
deodorizers in the ----ing room.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.109
Turns out I have a little OCD.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.153
Sleep well, mate.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.915
Charter three.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.126
Natalya, Natalya, Tasha.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.754
Can you meet me
in the stew pantry?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.506
-Copy that.
-Morning, guvna.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.924
Morning, mate.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.550
So, today...

07:47.592 --> 07:48.968
so, I need to sort the flowers,

07:49.010 --> 07:50.804
we’ll need to clean
the main deck day head.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.347
Okay, I’ll do that first.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.474
They’re gonna have champagne
as their welcome drink,

07:54.516 --> 07:57.435
and then sit for lunch.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.978
Can I do, like,
a nautical theme?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.563
We’ll grab those hats out,
just to start off?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.107
Yes, get the sailor hats on.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.733
All right, I’m gonna
start the day head.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.818
Sailor’s hat.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.152
Where’d you want me to get now?

08:06.194 --> 08:07.779
Do you wanna just start
banging out that laz?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.155
I’m just gonna hit
the scuppers quickly.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.615
Cool.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.624
He is not single.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.345
-Hello?
-Hello! Hey.

08:32.387 --> 08:33.680
Coming up...

08:33.722 --> 08:35.515
Six meters [garbled
radio chatter] stern.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.808
I don’t hear Storm.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.268
Three meters to
V4 off your...

08:38.309 --> 08:39.352
[garbled transmission]

08:54.993 --> 08:55.410
-Hello?
-Hi!

08:56.578 --> 08:58.913
-Hi!
-So good to see you.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.582
You, too, how are you?

09:00.623 --> 09:03.960
Good, it’s been great to
know what you’ve been up to.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.587
Oh, yeah, so much.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.589
-How’ve you been?
-Good.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.466
Oh, I’m excited to
be back, but...

09:09.507 --> 09:10.550
-Yeah.
-I’m a bit...

09:10.592 --> 09:11.551
I’m very nervous to be on deck.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.178
I’m back!

09:13.219 --> 09:15.805
I was kind of in two
minds after last season.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.390
Like, being promoted
to second stew.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.309
I do wanna give you these.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.769
Stop!

09:20.810 --> 09:22.228
I feel like I used to
go on boats and be, like,

09:22.270 --> 09:24.314
known as the wild one,
the crazy one.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.441
* We’re here in the galley
and we’re chillin’ with daddy *

09:26.483 --> 09:29.110
* We’ve got a lot going on but
we’re feeling so swaggy *

09:29.152 --> 09:32.155
Last season it was so intense,

09:32.197 --> 09:36.159
and I was constantly inside and
stressed and never saw daylight.

09:42.707 --> 09:43.958
I definitely feel like
a deckhand, like,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.669
fits my personally
better than a stew.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.795
Courtney’s switching
to deck crew.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.421
This is epic!

09:48.463 --> 09:50.507
Getting the call from
Sandy to come back,

09:50.548 --> 09:53.510
I’m excited, but I’m,
like, super nervous as well.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.303
I’m ready to get to twerk.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.724
Oh, there’s Mzi!

09:59.766 --> 10:01.601
-Hi!
-Hey!

10:01.643 --> 10:04.062
-How are you?
-How are you?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.271
Yeah, not so bad, thank you.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.398
Good!

10:06.439 --> 10:08.817
I love Mzi’s face
when he sees you.

10:08.858 --> 10:09.984
Can you show me everyone?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.820
-Yeah.
-I’m Courtney, hi.

10:11.861 --> 10:12.862
Jason, nice to meet you.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.322
Hi, nice to meet you.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.699
Storm, would you like to meet
the new deckhand?

10:15.740 --> 10:16.908
Hi!

10:16.950 --> 10:17.992
Hi, have you got
your bags on board?

10:18.034 --> 10:19.494
I’m gonna grab it in a second,

10:19.536 --> 10:20.662
but I just wanted
to come on and meet everyone.

10:20.704 --> 10:21.663
Yeah, sure.

10:21.705 --> 10:22.831
Is Storm your real name?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.040
-It is indeed.
-That’s so cool!

10:24.082 --> 10:25.917
-Lovely to meet you.
-Yeah, you too.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.714
I’m so, so stoked to
have Courtney back.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.757
Courtney’s definitely gonna
bring a twerk to the team,

10:32.799 --> 10:35.343
and some good banter, too.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.888
After Lady Michelle,
she did come to Cape Town.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.974
We’ve both come such a
long way in terms of

10:41.016 --> 10:45.145
our actual friendship and
I’ve grown even fonder of Court.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.147
[laughing]

10:50.233 --> 10:52.235
I...

10:52.277 --> 10:54.195
No.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.699
I... [laughing]

10:57.741 --> 10:59.034
No.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.702
Hi, I’m Courtney,
nice to meet you.

11:00.744 --> 11:01.828
-Nice to meet you!
-What’s your name?

11:01.870 --> 11:02.829
-Tasha.
-Tasha...

11:02.871 --> 11:03.913
nice to meet you, Tasha.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.331
How are you?
Oh, sorry.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.833
-Dave, nice to meet you.
-Courtney, nice to meet you.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.376
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.836
I’ve just put your uniform
on your bed, Courtney.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.421
Oh, thank you so much.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.387
Do you want a tea or coffee?

11:19.429 --> 11:20.555
Yeah, all right.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.806
-Hi!
-I’m Natalya.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.558
Hi, Courtney, nice to meet you.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.809
I’m your roomie.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.605
There’s Natasha
and then Natalya.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.981
-Okay.
-So, we’re called...

11:30.023 --> 11:31.232
-Natasha and Natalya.
-Yeah, Tash and Nat.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.525
Okay, and while
you’re on board...

11:32.567 --> 11:33.735
-I’m Nat.
-No, I know.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.987
Oh, wow...
wow, I’m screaming.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.113
-We’re both second stews.
-Second, yeah.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.531
-Okay, nice.
-Yeah.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.575
Deck crew, deck crew,
please can you meet me

11:40.617 --> 11:41.743
on the aft deck
for a quick meeting?

11:41.785 --> 11:42.952
Copy.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.872
-Hello.
-Hello.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.958
-So, welcome to the crew.
-Thank you.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.296
For this charter, I did
print a new deck schedule.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.507
You will have everything there,
it’s your hours of watch.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.094
In the evening, we do really try
to help out the interior.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.053
Yeah.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.012
Well, you know what that’s like.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.597
For this whole charter, like,

12:02.639 --> 12:04.557
if you see thing that are
lying around, pick them up.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.142
Just the small things that’ll
make the biggest difference.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.103
And then I’m sure
we’ll have a great time.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.604
I’m a very intense person.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.231
I have an enlarged heart.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.234
I was in Sri Lanka in 2019.
I was just surfing.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.946
I just felt this, like,
crazy drop in my heart,

12:17.987 --> 12:19.531
like, I couldn’t
breathe properly,

12:19.572 --> 12:21.241
my arm started to go numb.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.995
I had to have surgery,
which is cardioversion.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.789
So, they stop your heart
and then they restart it.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.165
I was dead for two minutes.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.292
It definitely changed my mindset

12:31.334 --> 12:33.211
to just live
as hardcore as I can.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.422
Everything that I’m gonna
do now, I’m gonna overdo.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.591
Grab a microfiber, where the
scuppers are clean the drains,

12:38.633 --> 12:39.968
just so they walk on
and it’s beautiful.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.177
-Yeah.
-Thanks, guys.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.345
Sure.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.722
I can’t wait.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.098
This is gonna be such a fun
little table setting.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.307
I’ve got your hat.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.309
I wish this was
actually our uniform.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.478
Hit me,
I’ll do this side underneath.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.688
Yeah, it’s gross.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.314
I’m actually really
nervous for, like...

12:53.356 --> 12:56.735
I just need to know how to
do the anchor and sh--.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.445
No, it’s all Gucci.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.488
Provisions, eh?

13:00.530 --> 13:01.865
All crew, all crew,
we have provisions.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.495
All right.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.122
Ooh!

13:10.206 --> 13:11.624
-You all right there?
-Yeah, yeah.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.625
Yeah?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.044
The Leaning Tower of Pisa.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.839
How is this all
gonna fit, Mzi?

13:17.881 --> 13:19.716
It’s a bit of a mystery.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.092
Tonight is, like,
the big night

13:21.134 --> 13:22.886
for the fiftieth birthday for
the primary.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.598
Yas.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.434
<i>Interior, interior,</i>
<i>looking fab, well done.</i>

13:29.476 --> 13:31.561
I wish I could say
the same for Kyle.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.937
This one drives me insane.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.568
[bleep]
These swells are not good.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.154
We have a charter
boarding today, and right now,

13:41.196 --> 13:42.697
the dock,
the wind’s kinda calm.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.991
For the lay person,
they have no idea the minute

13:45.033 --> 13:47.160
I turn that corner
how big the swells are.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.328
They’re massive.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.538
That’s not fun for anyone.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.249
So, unfortunately,
I can’t leave the dock.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.754
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>
<i>get into your whites.</i>

13:57.796 --> 14:00.173
<i>Let’s meet in the main salon</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

14:00.215 --> 14:02.509
Oh, they’d make nice booty
shorts.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.510
Let’s get naked.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.011
Woo!

14:07.764 --> 14:08.932
Okay.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.017
My teeth, babe,
it’s really sore.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.394
You need to get to a dentist.

14:12.435 --> 14:13.645
Mm, ASAP.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.313
But it’s not like
I’m dying with pain now.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.564
Like, I’m continuing.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.566
My tooth is actually
really painful

14:18.608 --> 14:20.402
because I grind
my teeth at night.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.404
I mean, the jawline
is fantastic,

14:22.445 --> 14:25.115
but it’s, like,
really killing me.

14:25.156 --> 14:28.576
All right, so, now,
we have a new crewmember.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.661
Woohoo!

14:29.703 --> 14:30.704
-You guys have met.
-Ooh!

14:30.745 --> 14:32.372
Welcome, Courtney.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.790
Thanks, guys.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.709
All right, anyway,

14:35.750 --> 14:39.087
it’s too rough out there
to go and anchor.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.047
We’re staying on the dock,

14:41.089 --> 14:43.591
so we really gotta
pull out all the stops.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.219
All right, awesome,
let’s line up on the dock.

14:51.975 --> 14:52.934
Are my boobs straight?

14:52.976 --> 14:54.060
Yeah, you look good.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.521
Let me know if one pops out.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.814
Remember what was on the
preference sheet.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.566
Dancing naked boys.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.900
-Hi!
-Hi.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.569
-Welcome.
-Thank you!

15:02.610 --> 15:05.113
-Sandy, nice to meet you.
-I’m Kristina, nice to meet you.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.948
-David.
-David, nice to meet you.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.825
-Hello, I’m Kyle.
-I’m Dina.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.035
Lovely to meet you, Dina.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.412
Welcome to your
home away from home.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.914
I can take you on a little
tour of the boat, if you like.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.291
-That’d be great.
-Yeah?

15:16.332 --> 15:17.459
It is absolutely beautiful.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.753
----ing hell...
two days.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.004
What the hell?

15:24.257 --> 15:27.010
I bet we’ll all manage
to fit in this hot tub.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.511
Oh, my God, yes.

15:28.553 --> 15:31.514
Try and fish some hot
deckhands in there with you.

15:31.556 --> 15:34.184
-Oh!
-The more the merrier.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.727
-Can you get the Dyson for me?
-Yep.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.062
I just want to buzz inside.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.525
Through here,
my favorite room on the boat,

15:42.567 --> 15:44.486
-just because it’s so...
-It’s beautiful.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.029
This is a sister bed for sure.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.655
-Are you sisters?
-We’re sisters.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.699
-They’re sisters.
-We’re cousins.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.867
And we’re cousins.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.243
-Oh!
-Wow!

15:52.285 --> 15:53.953
Did you tell them
we’re sisters too?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.372
-No?
-[laughing]

15:55.413 --> 15:56.623
Oh, God, this boat’s rocking.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.208
I think I need
an anti-nausea pill.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.460
-Can I have all you...
-Yes!

16:00.502 --> 16:03.880
Okay, so, if the weather
changes, or the seas,

16:03.922 --> 16:08.468
the swell dissipates,
I’m off the dock like that.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.719
But see how we’re
rocking at the dock?

16:09.761 --> 16:10.970
Yeah.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.514
It’ll be, like,
tenfold out there.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.558
So, now the plan is
we’re gonna stay on the dock.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.603
Are you kidding?

16:39.207 --> 16:40.166
See how we’re
rocking at the dock?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.043
Yeah.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.253
It’ll be, like,
tenfold out there.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.754
So, we’re gonna
stay on the dock.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.256
Are you kidding?

16:46.297 --> 16:47.674
You would be really
seasick if we went out there.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.050
Yeah.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.011
But I’m gonna challenge
my crew to entertain you.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.930
How do you feel like an
adventure off the boat, like...

16:53.972 --> 16:55.015
-Yeah!
-Yes!

16:55.056 --> 16:56.057
With a nice view?

16:56.099 --> 16:57.434
Who would ever say no to that?

16:57.475 --> 16:58.601
Okay, just wanna make sure.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.311
When you’re stuck on the dock,

17:00.353 --> 17:02.564
the best thing to do
is feed them alcohol.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.484
-I can unpack for master.
-Unpack master?

17:06.526 --> 17:07.819
All right.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.446
Just in terms of lunch today,

17:09.487 --> 17:11.781
do you have a certain time that
you might like to eat lunch?

17:11.823 --> 17:13.783
Like, 2:00,
does that sound good?

17:13.825 --> 17:15.160
Yeah.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.457
So, the plan for today?

17:20.498 --> 17:22.167
So, we just have hands
on interior all day.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.335
Yeah.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.420
Just basically go to Tash
and Nat

17:25.462 --> 17:26.755
and just ask whatever you
can do just to help, yeah.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.840
See what they need?
Okay, cool.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.633
You guys can get in your reds.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.639
Can I maybe do
a spoon for me?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.350
Yeah.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.769
Have you got a spoon?

17:40.810 --> 17:42.270
Let me take the top of
and then you can keep it

17:42.312 --> 17:43.271
and then put it on after.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.397
Oh, yeah, perfect.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.940
Thanks, Dave.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.194
I consider myself lucky
that I’m still on board.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.489
Growing up, I was
fighting so much,

17:52.530 --> 17:54.366
and my whole life’s
been about changing.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.369
When I moved away from
the UK and went to,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.662
like, the Alps and I was
doing ski seasons,

17:59.704 --> 18:03.208
I’m meeting, like, nicer people,
I kinda got qualities from them.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.336
So, I’m definitely gonna keep
that with me, that gratitude,

18:06.378 --> 18:11.257
and I’m gonna work even harder
and support everyone on board.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.968
-Have you two eaten yet?
-What’s that?

18:14.010 --> 18:15.136
A little avo and focaccia.

18:15.178 --> 18:18.056
Oh, my God, dreamy.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.183
Should we go up on the deck?

18:20.225 --> 18:21.184
Yeah.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.269
It is so beautiful.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.897
-Tash?
-Yeah?

18:25.939 --> 18:27.357
Do you want us to stay helping
in here, or do you want me...

18:27.399 --> 18:28.942
-Yeah.
-to help in the galley, or what?

18:28.983 --> 18:32.529
Maybe see if Natalya needs
a hand in the master cabin.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.613
-Yeah?
-That would be good.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.407
-Thank you.
-No worries.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.826
And then Jason, do you know
if Dave needs a hand?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.411
Guys, hold on, I’m gonna
take a picture of you guys,

18:39.452 --> 18:40.870
because this is a
really pretty background.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.622
-I’m here to help.
-Are you?

18:42.664 --> 18:43.915
Yeah.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.375
Dave, anything I can help with?

18:45.417 --> 18:46.835
Well, you can do some dishes
if you want, mate.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.461
Yep.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.547
The things going through Dave’s
head, I just feel bad for him.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.340
He’s gotta be a full-time chef
for clients

18:52.382 --> 18:54.009
that are expecting the best.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.137
Then you throw in
the emotions of him and Tash.

18:57.178 --> 19:00.932
I cannot even fathom
how difficult that must be.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.809
I would have jumped
off the Goddamn boat.

19:02.851 --> 19:03.768
-Got it?
-Super.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.478
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.022
At least there’s a
lot of wardrobe space.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.398
It’s so good.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.774
And, like, the thing is
I can fit the luggage

19:09.816 --> 19:11.192
in there as well, so you
don’t even have to get,

19:11.234 --> 19:12.444
like, the deck boys
to take, like...

19:12.485 --> 19:13.862
-Yeah.
-deck... deck girls...

19:13.903 --> 19:14.654
Yeah.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.197
How you going on, though?

19:16.239 --> 19:18.408
Yeah, fine, I mean,
because we’re not leaving port,

19:18.450 --> 19:20.493
-there’s not been much to do.
-Yeah.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.328
Everyone knows that,
like, deckhands will always

19:22.370 --> 19:24.122
help with interior and interior
will always help with deck,

19:24.164 --> 19:26.833
but obviously, I’ve just come
on as a deckhand and,

19:26.875 --> 19:28.501
like, put straight
back into cabins.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.837
It is a bit, like, uh...

19:30.879 --> 19:32.589
to be fair, it also kinda
makes me appreciate the fact

19:32.630 --> 19:34.132
that I’ve changed to deck,

19:34.174 --> 19:36.259
because when I am in there,
I’m like thank [bleep]

19:36.301 --> 19:38.762
I’m so glad that I’m not
doing this full-time.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.680
You’re welcome.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.932
Okay, I’ll just
start on this side.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.351
Can I get any more drinks?

19:44.392 --> 19:46.269
Do you guys have stuff to
make dirty martinis?

19:46.311 --> 19:48.563
Of course, so, we’re gonna
have an extra-dirty, or just...

19:48.605 --> 19:50.440
-I like it dirty.
-Like, nasty.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.776
-Yeah, nasty.
-Filthy.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.444
Yeah, okay.

19:54.486 --> 19:55.987
Ooh, nice swimmie.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.324
I’ll start making
the cocktails, then.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.700
Yeah, actually, we’ve--

20:00.742 --> 20:02.202
So, we start this one
with the Belvedere, hey?

20:02.243 --> 20:03.620
-Yeah, yeah, Belvedere.
-Okay, Grey Goose, coming up.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.498
Got Grey Goose,
we just need some juice.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.002
Tell me the hot goss.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.802
So there’s, like,
the negative relationship

20:18.843 --> 20:20.303
on board, and then there’s,
like, the new positive one.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.181
What’s the new positive one?

20:23.223 --> 20:24.265
Storm.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.476
Ah!

20:26.518 --> 20:27.477
You guys bang?

20:27.519 --> 20:28.687
No, we haven’t yet.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.648
Can we give you some
bow ties to make...

20:31.690 --> 20:33.900
Yeah. I can wear the
dungarees with no shirt on.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.152
Mm [bleep].

20:36.194 --> 20:37.612
After dinner, yeah?

20:37.654 --> 20:39.155
Mm-hmm, and Dave’s gonna
do the cake delivery.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.741
-Okay.
-Thank you!

20:41.783 --> 20:43.326
Just to ask, how comfortable

20:43.368 --> 20:46.413
are we with, like,
semi-nude men?

20:46.454 --> 20:47.414
-Extremely.
-Very comfortable.

20:47.455 --> 20:48.415
Are we very?

20:48.456 --> 20:50.834
During lunch, fully nude.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.293
Yeah, okay.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.712
Ooh.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.549
These swells are big.

20:59.134 --> 21:02.721
I haven’t got Scooby-Doo on
this whole Malta cuisine, mate.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.556
So, I’m flat-out winging it.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.849
Oh, yeah, I saw that
on their preference.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.017
It’s like, just say fish.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.601
I’ll get...

21:08.643 --> 21:11.688
well, I’ve got local fish here,
and so that’s a classic.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.231
I’ve never made
traditional Maltese food.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.483
This is a ----ing complete
brain block for me.

21:15.525 --> 21:18.695
So, I picked some things that
I could manipulate and change.

21:18.737 --> 21:20.155
Took some classic French dishes

21:20.196 --> 21:22.907
and mixed them with
some random Maltese dishes.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.409
So, we’ll see how that goes.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.412
Okay, I’m ready.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.039
-You ready for lunch?
-Let’s do it!

21:29.080 --> 21:30.290
Yes.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.208
-Fab. Just make a move down.
-Let’s do it.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.209
Don’t wanna spill my cocktail.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.377
I love this.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.087
The hats are so adorable.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.214
-Thank you so much.
-You’re so welcome.

21:38.256 --> 21:41.009
Okily-dokily.

21:41.051 --> 21:43.511
Sandy’s, like, really adamant
to get off the boat.

21:43.553 --> 21:44.804
They wanna tour around Malta.

21:44.846 --> 21:46.681
Just like chaperone them
around the town.

21:46.723 --> 21:47.974
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.726
I need someone to come
and help me.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.061
Yeah, yeah, be there
in one minute.

21:51.102 --> 21:51.895
Okay.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.563
There’s a golf cart tour.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.315
Sounds rad,
we’ll go on a golf tour.

21:55.357 --> 21:58.568
So, are we sending a crewmember
with them round the town?

21:58.610 --> 21:59.861
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.406
Mzi?

22:03.448 --> 22:04.824
Mzi, pull your pants up!

22:06.576 --> 22:07.911
You know the golf carts
opposite the way?

22:07.952 --> 22:09.245
Yeah.

22:09.287 --> 22:12.082
They’re gonna go on, like,
a little see-tour.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.333
When they walk into
the bridge deck salon...

22:13.375 --> 22:14.876
Mm-hmm.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.419
Pink balloons hanging from
the roof, with streamers.

22:16.461 --> 22:18.421
-I think pink, red, and white.
-Yeah?

22:18.463 --> 22:20.840
So, this is a popular
fish round here.

22:20.882 --> 22:23.259
Okay.

22:23.301 --> 22:26.012
I am literally sweating down
my butt crack right now.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.013
[phone chimes]

22:27.055 --> 22:28.932
Where are the...

22:28.973 --> 22:31.101
So, just putting on tonight
you want me to do--

22:31.142 --> 22:32.936
One second, because
this is quite urgent.

22:36.690 --> 22:39.317
This is a local,
very popular fish,

22:39.359 --> 22:42.612
very similar to sea bass,
but it’s called meagre.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.447
Mm, this is delicious.

22:44.489 --> 22:46.825
Oh, my God, this is the best
thing I’ve ever had in my life.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.204
Where’s the chief stew,
actually?

22:51.246 --> 22:54.165
So, I’m gonna send you
with Courtney and Mzi,

22:54.207 --> 22:55.959
and you three are
gonna take them through.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.127
-A little expedition?
-Yeah.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.128
Gotcha.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.255
What the hell is going on?

23:00.296 --> 23:02.549
Like, I’ve just going on
service I’m doing alone,

23:02.590 --> 23:03.633
and it’s ----ing
pissing me off.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.176
What do you mean?

23:05.218 --> 23:08.555
Literally, like, I’m up and down
the entire ----ing time.

23:10.849 --> 23:12.308
Well, no one’s told me anything.

23:12.350 --> 23:13.977
I’ve literally been asking
for help the whole time.

23:14.019 --> 23:15.311
No one has asked me for help.

23:15.353 --> 23:16.688
Like, Tash and you are
supposed to be service.

23:20.859 --> 23:23.695
Tash is distracted
by no one knows.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.572
I’m already in pain
with my teeth.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.532
No one is literally
helping me on service,

23:27.574 --> 23:30.076
and then I only have Nat
to rely on in interior.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.787
I need to jump into laundry
because it is a sh---show.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.874
[bleep] me, this is
getting out of control.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.043
Coming up...

23:43.965 --> 23:45.717
I needed two people on service,
that’s why I need you to go...

23:45.759 --> 23:46.718
Yeah, I know.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.219
I’m a little pissed off.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.229
Are you enjoying your food?
Is everything all right?

23:59.522 --> 24:01.566
-It is, yes!
-That’s good.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.693
So, this evening you are
gonna jump on golf carts

24:03.735 --> 24:05.403
and you’re gonna go on a
little city trip

24:05.445 --> 24:07.072
and have drinks, if that’s
something that

24:07.113 --> 24:08.490
you’d be interested in,
just to get off the boat

24:08.531 --> 24:09.491
and go have a little
bit of a walk.

24:09.532 --> 24:12.535
Yeah, yeah.

24:12.577 --> 24:14.037
-Hello?
-Hello, Rico.

24:14.079 --> 24:16.748
Going to have a
golf cart tour at 6:00 p.m.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.167
I do have a tour guide for you.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.460
-Perfect.
-Okay.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.920
Thank you, bye-bye.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.422
Are you gonna change for the
tour or whatever?

24:24.464 --> 24:25.423
Let’s get ready.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.758
All right, so you got a plan?

24:26.800 --> 24:28.927
So, we’re organizing
these golf carts

24:28.968 --> 24:30.428
to take them with
a guide into town.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.138
-Awesome sauce.
-Yeah.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.390
Nat, Nat, Tasha.

24:33.431 --> 24:36.059
Can you help clear
the bridge deck aft table?

24:36.101 --> 24:37.143
Copy that.

24:37.185 --> 24:38.853
Oh, la la.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.816
Yeah, I wanna sit down
and change, that’s all.

24:42.857 --> 24:43.858
Wait, I’ll wait...

24:43.900 --> 24:44.859
I’ll see you in a few.

24:44.901 --> 24:46.361
Oh, I’m lower.

24:51.449 --> 24:54.411
I don’t even know what
I’m doing, I’m so disorientated.

24:54.452 --> 24:55.745
You are looking a bit white.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.833
Take a rest.

24:59.874 --> 25:01.292
So, listen, I’m not gonna
[bleep] up service.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.794
Can I be in housekeeping
tonight, just for tonight?

25:02.836 --> 25:04.170
Yeah, 100 percent.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.672
Hey, look, there’s
the golf buggy tour.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.716
Okay, I think we might be ready.

25:07.757 --> 25:10.510
-We need shoes?
-I would recommend it.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.303
Flip-flops, or cute shoes.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.097
We could just flip-flop it out.

25:14.139 --> 25:15.306
Did you say "flip-flop it out?"

25:15.348 --> 25:16.349
Yeah.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.517
That’s what he said!

25:17.559 --> 25:18.893
All right, guys,
have a lovely time

25:18.935 --> 25:20.437
and we’ll see you when
you get back.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.479
All right, thank you.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.522
Is that everyone off now?

25:22.564 --> 25:24.065
Yeah.

25:27.277 --> 25:29.738
How much fun is just
decorating sh--?

25:30.739 --> 25:32.532
Hello, ladies, welcome to Malta.

25:32.574 --> 25:33.575
-Hi!
-Hello.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.285
So, we are going to do a tour.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.870
You’re going to see
a little bit

25:36.911 --> 25:38.997
the most historical
part of Malta.

25:39.039 --> 25:40.373
Let’s take the carts.

25:40.415 --> 25:42.292
Come on, Tina.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.502
-Where do I sit?
-We need one over here.

25:44.544 --> 25:47.088
Mzi.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.381
Right-hand side.

25:48.423 --> 25:50.925
Oh, my God.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.010
Driving the golf cart
takes me straight

25:52.052 --> 25:53.470
back home to the golf course.

25:53.511 --> 25:56.306
I’ve been playing since
I was seven years old.

25:58.058 --> 25:58.808
Woo!

25:58.850 --> 26:00.268
-Oh!
-He hit it.

26:00.310 --> 26:04.356
Does Mzi be hustling people
every charter down here?

26:04.397 --> 26:06.316
Golf requires huge
amounts of practice.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.234
I think in yachting, like,
a lot of the things

26:08.276 --> 26:10.320
that you do in practice,
it’s like muscle memory.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.489
Let’s hope by the
end of the season

26:12.530 --> 26:14.366
I can handle a tender
like a golf cart.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.034
-Ah!
-Whoa!

26:16.076 --> 26:17.702
Oh!

26:17.744 --> 26:19.412
-Should we race?
-Yeah, racing.

26:19.454 --> 26:21.331
No!

26:21.373 --> 26:24.292
If you’re not first,
you’re last.

26:24.334 --> 26:26.670
Storm did his schedule,
he’s got his anchor watches.

26:26.711 --> 26:29.047
It’s very good, actually.

26:32.717 --> 26:33.885
That’s amazing.

26:33.927 --> 26:36.388
These could be
outfits for tonight.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.555
Yes, oh, my God.

26:37.597 --> 26:38.932
Look at that.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.266
Yeah, there’s two here.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.185
Why don’t we just
be twins, perfect.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.612
You know the walls
that used be around the city?

26:52.654 --> 26:53.697
When were those built?

26:53.738 --> 26:55.115
In the years 1400.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.909
If you wanna buy
a souvenir on Malta...

26:57.951 --> 27:00.120
-I’m not for sale.
-unless...

27:00.161 --> 27:03.123
-Tell us.
-No, not him.

27:03.164 --> 27:06.251
Storm, Storm, please come to the
bridge, Storm to the bridge.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.877
Copy, on my way.

27:09.379 --> 27:13.133
Hey, so, tomorrow morning the
weather gets better, look.

27:13.174 --> 27:14.676
-So, by...
-Much better, yeah.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.428
-...actually through the night,

27:16.469 --> 27:19.639
we’re off the dock at 7:00 a.m.,
we’re throwing our lines.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.099
-Lines, yeah, yeah.
-Okay?

27:21.141 --> 27:22.392
-Sounds good.
-All right, great, thanks.

27:22.434 --> 27:23.435
Thanks, Cap.

27:24.936 --> 27:27.814
We are going for
a fantastic view now.

27:27.856 --> 27:29.190
All right, guys,
we are stepping up

27:29.232 --> 27:31.776
and we are going here
to the garden.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.069
Oh, this is pretty.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.779
So, here you have
a fantastic view.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.364
Oh, it’s beautiful.

27:36.406 --> 27:38.950
Over there is Valetta,
the capitol of Malta.

27:38.992 --> 27:41.286
This is the smallest
capitol of Europe.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.620
Oh!

27:42.662 --> 27:44.039
All right, are you ladies ready?

27:44.080 --> 27:45.248
We’re ready to go
back on the golf carts.

27:45.290 --> 27:46.541
-Ready to rock and roll?
-Yeah.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.668
Let’s go.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.170
[phone ringing]

27:54.841 --> 27:56.301
I’m sorry to
call you.

28:24.704 --> 28:27.248
My ex is telling me,
"Stop beating yourself up,

28:27.290 --> 28:30.627
we can make this work,
like, I forgive you."

28:30.669 --> 28:34.881
Kind of makes me feel like
why am I not fighting for this?

28:40.387 --> 28:42.514
I don’t know what
the right thing to do is.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.475
All right, my love,
I’ll speak to you soon.

28:45.517 --> 28:46.685
All right, bye.

28:46.726 --> 28:48.353
Bye, my love, bye.

28:52.399 --> 28:54.192
Coming up...

28:54.234 --> 28:55.902
Oh!

28:55.944 --> 28:57.362
I thought my stripping
days were done.

28:57.404 --> 28:58.988
I’m not cut out
for this anymore.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.699
We do have one more
surprise for you.

29:08.623 --> 29:09.833
What do you do with that,
do you ever touch it?

29:11.292 --> 29:14.921
-[horn honks]
-Oh, it’s a little horn!

29:14.963 --> 29:17.173
[honking]

29:22.178 --> 29:23.722
<i>Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.</i>

29:23.763 --> 29:25.056
Yes, Tash?

29:25.098 --> 29:27.434
Just go to bed, Kyle,
you need to rest.

29:27.475 --> 29:29.310
Okay, let me flip
the laundry quickly.

29:29.352 --> 29:31.688
Do not touch the laundry,
Kyle, honestly.

29:34.149 --> 29:36.735
Oh, my goodness,
those are beautiful!

29:36.776 --> 29:37.694
Mm!

29:41.072 --> 29:44.576
You do look very
sexy in that dress.

29:44.617 --> 29:45.618
Oh, my God.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.456
I love throwing a themed party.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.082
That’s, like, my specialty.

29:51.124 --> 29:53.293
And I am a bit
of a micromanager,

29:53.335 --> 29:56.004
but seeing your vision
actually come together,

29:56.046 --> 29:57.464
it’s a great feeling.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.424
Like, I live to see
the guests’ reactions.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.634
So, I’m hoping that they’re
just gonna be blown away.

30:01.676 --> 30:03.553
Are you actually gonna
do it with your mouth?

30:03.595 --> 30:05.513
Yeah.

30:05.555 --> 30:06.806
Show what that mouth do.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.016
[laughing]

30:10.310 --> 30:13.521
-Mm.
-Oh, babe.

30:19.194 --> 30:20.653
Are you speaking
to rectify

30:20.695 --> 30:22.697
or are you speaking to
there’s a possibility?

30:22.739 --> 30:24.240
No, like after everything,

30:24.282 --> 30:26.576
he loves and
he supports me so much.

30:26.618 --> 30:28.620
He just wants
to sort things out.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.956
And how do you feel
about that, yes or no?

30:31.998 --> 30:37.420
Honestly, he is, like,
a straight version of you.

30:37.462 --> 30:40.382
Like, I’ve never met anyone
that makes me laugh as much.

30:40.423 --> 30:43.760
Going through this whole
situation with Dave

30:43.802 --> 30:47.681
that was just awful made me
realize I still love my ex.

30:47.722 --> 30:51.559
We’re both very similar people,
and we both love to party.

30:51.601 --> 30:54.229
Like, our house
is just constant parties.

30:54.270 --> 30:57.732
And with him,
I can be happy, I can be me.

30:57.774 --> 31:00.235
I never wanted to hurt him,

31:00.276 --> 31:04.239
I just guess I let
things get out of control.

31:06.491 --> 31:08.952
I do like to run away
from problems a lot.

31:08.993 --> 31:09.953
Yeah.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.371
But anyway, go to sleep.

31:11.413 --> 31:12.747
I’m getting ready,
I’m not gonna bore you.

31:12.789 --> 31:15.250
-Good night, love you.
-All right, I love you.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.214
And we’re home.

31:21.256 --> 31:22.215
Here we are.

31:22.257 --> 31:23.675
Made it back in one piece.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.260
The guests are back.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.179
-You enjoyed it?
-So fun.

31:28.221 --> 31:30.223
Drinks, welcome drinks.

31:30.265 --> 31:32.434
There you go.

31:32.475 --> 31:34.352
Oh, my God, I’m so excited.

31:34.394 --> 31:35.895
Wait, so should we
change into dinner clothes?

31:35.937 --> 31:37.856
Can you grab me another straw?

31:37.897 --> 31:39.566
Thank you so
much, Storm.

31:39.607 --> 31:42.235
Oh, my God,
look at you, Natasha!

31:42.277 --> 31:44.988
Look at your cute
sequined dress!

31:45.030 --> 31:46.448
Thank you.

31:49.409 --> 31:52.579
What time is dinner, should
we change into dinner stuff?

31:52.620 --> 31:54.664
Any time you’d like,
yeah, all right.

31:54.706 --> 31:56.458
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

32:01.963 --> 32:04.257
So, for dinner tonight
we’re doing plated?

32:04.299 --> 32:07.177
With lobster gnocchi,
it’s plated.

32:07.218 --> 32:08.845
-Okay.
-And then dessert is the gateau.

32:08.887 --> 32:10.555
All right, thank you.

32:10.597 --> 32:13.516
You know, I’m so nervous.
I’ve never stripped before.

32:13.558 --> 32:14.809
Storm, what time
does this all happen?

32:14.851 --> 32:18.396
After dinner, when
Dave takes the cake up.

32:18.438 --> 32:19.439
I don’t really know
what to do, though.

32:19.481 --> 32:20.899
Does anyone have any tips?

32:20.940 --> 32:24.277
So, I’ll start the music
and then Mzi can show,

32:24.319 --> 32:25.528
"I’m the captain now."

32:25.570 --> 32:26.863
[laughing]

32:29.657 --> 32:30.909
Ugh!

32:30.950 --> 32:35.455
Who am I gonna steal
for stewardessing tonight?

32:35.497 --> 32:37.665
You can steal me.

32:37.707 --> 32:38.667
Aw, thank you.

32:38.708 --> 32:41.169
-Jason, you go down now.
-Okay.

32:41.211 --> 32:43.129
And then you sleep
for five hours,

32:43.171 --> 32:44.464
and then you’re up at
1:00 to 3:00,

32:44.506 --> 32:45.590
and then you go down again.

32:45.632 --> 32:47.300
-Okay, no worries, man.
-Okay.

32:47.342 --> 32:50.303
So, what do you
wanna plan tonight...

32:50.345 --> 32:52.639
We’re a man down, yeah.

32:53.973 --> 32:54.974
You wanna?

32:55.016 --> 32:57.227
I don’t care at all.

32:57.268 --> 32:58.770
What do you prefer?

33:04.818 --> 33:06.444
The thing is, I needed
two people on service.

33:06.486 --> 33:07.779
That’s why I needed--

33:07.821 --> 33:09.155
Yeah, I know but
Kyle’s obviously down.

33:09.197 --> 33:12.033
If you wanna make some flower...
Nat?

33:12.075 --> 33:13.451
What?

33:13.493 --> 33:16.329
I need to speak to
you about the cabins.

33:16.371 --> 33:19.374
-I’m a little pissed off.
-Yes, I can tell.

33:24.796 --> 33:25.922
For the birthday girls,

33:25.964 --> 33:27.632
we just need to do
something nice for them.

33:27.674 --> 33:30.176
So, maybe if you wanna get
some vases from under the TV...

33:30.218 --> 33:32.262
Yeah, I’ll sort it out.

33:33.805 --> 33:38.727
She’s not happy, but with
Courtney not knowing the boat

33:38.768 --> 33:41.980
I feel like it’s easier if
Courtney’s with me on service,

33:42.022 --> 33:43.565
just because I can guide her,

33:43.606 --> 33:46.359
whereas if Natalya
does the housekeeping,

33:46.401 --> 33:48.653
she can just do it fast
and it’s done.

33:48.695 --> 33:51.406
I’m the chief stew, and
I’m running this operation,

33:51.448 --> 33:54.617
and she needs
to listen, that’s it.

33:57.537 --> 33:59.622
This is gonna be
a very happy birthday.

33:59.664 --> 34:01.499
I need to switch to vodka.

34:04.085 --> 34:09.174
What is going on?

34:09.215 --> 34:13.303
Aw! That’s so cool!

34:23.104 --> 34:24.981
It’s absolute bullsh--.

34:26.191 --> 34:27.567
Coming up...

34:27.609 --> 34:29.903
It’s 30 meters [garbled
radio chatter] stern.

34:29.944 --> 34:31.905
You know, Storm, you’re not
coming through on my radio.

34:31.946 --> 34:34.074
Six meters [garbled
radio chatter] stern.

34:34.115 --> 34:35.533
I don’t hear Storm.

34:35.575 --> 34:37.577
Three meters to V4 off your
[garbled radio chatter].

34:37.619 --> 34:40.413
Storm, again, press your mic
and then talk.

34:51.758 --> 34:52.717
And actually, you should
be on service

34:54.010 --> 34:56.096
because you are such a loud,
outspoken bitch.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.055
Thank you.

34:59.683 --> 35:02.769
It’s really sh-- like, when
you ask a crewmember

35:02.811 --> 35:05.105
in interior to be setting
up a table

35:05.146 --> 35:06.856
and she’s done her all-out,

35:06.898 --> 35:08.775
and then to put her
in housekeeping

35:08.817 --> 35:10.902
and not see how the guests
enjoy her decoration?

35:10.944 --> 35:12.487
Damn.

35:12.529 --> 35:14.489
At one stage I’m, like, glad
that she can confide in me.

35:14.531 --> 35:15.990
On the other hand, I’m like,

35:16.032 --> 35:20.495
girl, I feel in pain,
I just wanna sleep, you know?

35:20.537 --> 35:23.456
Good night, love you

35:23.498 --> 35:24.833
Please come and visit me again.

35:24.874 --> 35:26.334
I’m actually gonna come
dry hump you later.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.253
Were you not feeling
the sequin dress?

35:28.294 --> 35:29.796
Oh, yeah, I can go put it on.

35:29.838 --> 35:31.381
I thought I was getting changed

35:31.423 --> 35:32.465
when the boys
were getting changed.

35:32.507 --> 35:35.385
-Oh.
-But I can go put it on.

35:38.221 --> 35:39.806
Hello!

35:43.393 --> 35:45.645
With everything that’s
happened between me and Tash,

35:45.687 --> 35:47.814
it’s been so difficult.

35:47.856 --> 35:49.649
That’s why I’m lucky
I have the galley.

35:49.691 --> 35:51.317
It clears my mind completely.

35:51.359 --> 35:54.738
I’ve got nothing to think about
apart from getting the job done.

35:54.779 --> 35:57.824
-Happy birthday!
-Woo!

36:00.118 --> 36:02.704
Happy thirty-second!

36:02.746 --> 36:03.705
Forever!

36:03.747 --> 36:06.041
-Looking good, girl!
-Wow!

36:06.082 --> 36:07.584
-Woo!
-Yeehaw!

36:07.625 --> 36:08.877
God, I hate pink and
I hate glitter.

36:08.918 --> 36:10.545
[laughing]

36:10.587 --> 36:12.422
[bleep] this is like
my worst nightmare.

36:12.464 --> 36:14.049
It is making us look
more professional,

36:14.090 --> 36:15.967
being in the same dress
and stuff right now.

36:16.009 --> 36:19.095
But I mean, obviously, starting
as a deckhand on a boat,

36:19.137 --> 36:20.889
I don’t really want
to be in a glittery

36:20.930 --> 36:23.475
pink sparkly dress
on my first night.

36:23.516 --> 36:26.227
-We have to perform the...
-Yeah, yeah, you’ll smash it.

36:26.269 --> 36:29.439
Have you been to the clubs
that Mzi’s gone to, then?

36:29.481 --> 36:32.108
I’m sure it’s not weird.

36:32.150 --> 36:33.735
Can we invite you
up to dinner soon?

36:33.777 --> 36:35.904
-Yes, great!
-All right.

36:35.945 --> 36:36.905
Let’s go.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.533
They should be
up at the table.

36:44.829 --> 36:47.665
Oh, look how cute you guys are.

36:47.707 --> 36:49.417
Oh, I love it!

36:49.459 --> 36:50.710
Oh, I can tell, a little casino!

36:50.752 --> 36:52.087
Oh, my God, it’s Vegas-themed!

36:52.128 --> 36:54.297
-Aw!
-So cute.

36:54.339 --> 36:55.924
Yeah.

36:55.965 --> 36:59.427
Oh, you guys are so cute in
your matching sequined outfits.

36:59.469 --> 37:00.970
Still or sparkling water?

37:01.012 --> 37:02.222
Still, please.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.974
If this isn’t
a representation of my day,

37:05.016 --> 37:06.685
then I don’t know
what else is.

37:06.726 --> 37:09.270
-Ready, guys?
-Nice, mate, this is exquisite.

37:09.312 --> 37:10.271
Ready to lead the way?

37:10.313 --> 37:11.564
Yeah.

37:11.606 --> 37:12.732
You’re going to announce
it, Dave, eh?

37:12.774 --> 37:14.109
Yeah, I’ll come announce it.

37:17.946 --> 37:19.614
Thank you.

37:19.656 --> 37:21.074
-You’re welcome.
-Good evening, ladies.

37:21.116 --> 37:23.118
All right, I’ve just got
sous vide lobster here.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.327
It’s beautiful.

37:24.369 --> 37:26.621
And then we’ve got
some sautéed gnocchi.

37:26.663 --> 37:29.624
-Thank you!
-Bon appétit.

37:29.666 --> 37:30.625
Thank you!

37:30.667 --> 37:32.377
The gnocchi is so good.

37:32.419 --> 37:34.504
Oh, my gosh, so good.

37:34.546 --> 37:36.047
I’m in heaven, it is amazing.

37:36.089 --> 37:39.676
What we need to do is get
your outfit sorted.

37:41.428 --> 37:42.929
What are we gonna
do after dinner?

37:42.971 --> 37:44.264
We are gonna have
entertainment tonight.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.683
-You think so?
-I do.

37:46.725 --> 37:47.809
Dude, I’m so nervous.

37:47.851 --> 37:49.060
I’ve never stripped before.

37:49.102 --> 37:50.311
I need a pair of pants.

37:50.353 --> 37:51.813
Wear those.

37:51.855 --> 37:53.398
Or do you wanna wear
some of my booty shorts?

37:53.440 --> 37:55.025
Do you have booty shorts?

37:55.066 --> 37:56.359
I’ve got booty shorts,
of course I’ve got booty shorts.

37:56.401 --> 37:57.986
They’re so good.

37:58.028 --> 38:00.613
Here’s a skirt, so it’ll
really flap around there.

38:00.655 --> 38:02.240
I thought my stripping
days were done.

38:02.282 --> 38:05.326
Gave a decent Magic Mike
performance last year.

38:05.368 --> 38:07.412
Woo!

38:07.454 --> 38:08.705
Oh!

38:08.747 --> 38:10.582
I’m not cut out
for this anymore.

38:10.623 --> 38:12.375
I’m packing a serious dad bod.

38:12.417 --> 38:14.544
Nobody wants to see this.

38:15.628 --> 38:17.672
Oh!

38:18.548 --> 38:20.342
[shrieks]

38:20.383 --> 38:22.719
This is amazing.

38:22.761 --> 38:27.390
Strike your pose.

38:27.432 --> 38:28.725
I’m gonna die.

38:28.767 --> 38:30.643
The Naked Chef, literally.

38:30.685 --> 38:33.063
Wow, Dave’s shredded, eh?

38:34.898 --> 38:36.149
Okay, we’re ready now.

38:38.276 --> 38:43.365
* Happy birthday to you *

38:43.406 --> 38:47.702
-* Happy birthday to you *
-[cheering]

38:47.744 --> 38:51.456
I feel like my heart’s,
like, about 130.

38:51.498 --> 38:52.749
Happy birthday, girls.

38:52.791 --> 38:55.669
We do have one more
surprise for you.

38:55.710 --> 38:59.381
-Oh!
-Woo!

38:59.422 --> 39:02.342
Oh, my God!

39:02.384 --> 39:04.678
[cheering]

39:13.144 --> 39:14.646
Happy birthday!

39:16.064 --> 39:17.982
[laughing]

39:20.402 --> 39:22.445
-Woo!
-Happy birthday.

39:22.487 --> 39:25.031
I would be more excited
to see Storm strip privately

39:25.073 --> 39:27.325
in my cabin
and not for 20 women.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.743
[laughing]

39:28.785 --> 39:30.620
Just saying.

39:30.662 --> 39:33.248
-Thank you!
-Happy birthday.

39:33.289 --> 39:35.834
Aw, thank you!

39:35.875 --> 39:37.877
Happy birthday to us!

39:37.919 --> 39:39.796
Okay, now let’s
take it downstairs,

39:39.838 --> 39:41.256
let’s do the real show.

39:41.297 --> 39:42.340
[laughing]

39:43.967 --> 39:46.344
It’s time to go down,
just go sleep.

39:46.386 --> 39:49.764
We have the vanilla cake
with butter crème, enjoy.

39:49.806 --> 39:52.934
Mm. I don’t even normally
like sweets.

39:55.645 --> 39:56.646
You’re down in 10, yeah?

39:56.688 --> 39:57.856
-Yeah.
-Cool.

39:57.897 --> 39:59.274
Should we go up to the hot tub?

39:59.315 --> 40:03.319
Meet you guys on
the top floor, let’s do it.

40:07.157 --> 40:08.116
Right good night.

40:08.158 --> 40:09.409
Good night, Dave.

40:09.451 --> 40:11.578
Are we going jaboozin, or
what’s happening?

40:11.619 --> 40:12.704
We’re jaboozin!

40:12.746 --> 40:14.122
Okay.

40:14.164 --> 40:15.373
[laughing]

40:22.964 --> 40:25.383
Is there a drink holder?

40:33.433 --> 40:36.019
-Is it?
-My pectorals.

40:39.689 --> 40:41.107
Oh, my God, I’m ready for bed.

41:09.386 --> 41:13.306
If I pull my shorts up too high
then I’ll get camel-toe, so...

41:13.348 --> 41:15.016
[laughing]

41:15.058 --> 41:16.351
-Hey, good morning.
-How are you?

41:16.393 --> 41:17.686
I see you’re ready.

41:17.727 --> 41:18.853
Looks like
the weather’s cooperating.

41:18.895 --> 41:19.854
Time to go.

41:19.896 --> 41:21.147
Do you still wanna go stern to,

41:21.189 --> 41:22.357
or do you wanna swing
your bow over?

41:22.399 --> 41:23.483
Stern-out.

41:23.525 --> 41:24.818
Sure, and then
I’ll tell the guys...

41:24.859 --> 41:26.152
-Location, distances.
-Yeah.

41:26.194 --> 41:27.529
-Location, distances.
-All right, cool.

41:27.570 --> 41:29.197
Thanks, Cap.

41:29.239 --> 41:30.532
Deck crew, what’s your location?

41:30.573 --> 41:31.908
On the dock.

41:35.036 --> 41:38.832
Okay, so, Courtney, you’re
gonna be on the bow with Jason.

41:38.873 --> 41:40.250
When you’re bringing the
spring in, like,

41:40.291 --> 41:42.252
and you single out, get it
in as soon as possible.

41:42.293 --> 41:44.379
Yeah, yeah, you
have to get it in.

41:44.421 --> 41:45.630
-Yeah.
-So, Jason.

41:45.672 --> 41:47.382
When the bow has
cleared the dolphins,

41:47.424 --> 41:48.633
you say "clear to swing."

41:48.675 --> 41:50.385
So, you’re gonna be
on the stern with me.

41:50.427 --> 41:52.137
What did you say about
the single-up thing?

41:52.178 --> 41:55.056
-The brace lines will go first.
-Yeah.

41:55.098 --> 41:58.143
<i>All crew,</i>
<i>we’re ready to depart.</i>

41:58.184 --> 42:00.228
We can free up all the lines.

42:00.270 --> 42:02.897
<i>-Bring ’em all in.</i>
<i>-Copy that, Captain.</i>

42:02.939 --> 42:04.149
Mzi, please join
me on the stern.

42:04.190 --> 42:05.400
All right.

42:05.442 --> 42:07.152
I’m so happy to be back,
like, as a deckhand.

42:07.193 --> 42:09.821
And I’m glad that these lines
are a lot smaller than

42:09.863 --> 42:11.406
my last boat, because
I’m hoping

42:11.448 --> 42:14.034
that it’ll be a lot easier now,
because these are smaller.

42:14.075 --> 42:15.910
So, you know when you,
like, learn

42:15.952 --> 42:17.537
with something
harder or bigger...

42:21.207 --> 42:23.376
Captain, that’s all
lines off the bow.

42:23.418 --> 42:24.836
Right, Captain,
that’s all lines on deck.

42:24.878 --> 42:26.504
Great!
Here we go.

42:31.509 --> 42:34.637
Storm, distances.
Storm, distances.

42:34.679 --> 42:35.680
<i>Copy that.</i>

42:35.722 --> 42:38.933
Five meters starboard quarter.

42:38.975 --> 42:41.770
[garbled radio chatter]

42:41.811 --> 42:43.730
Ten meters,
starboard quarter.

42:43.772 --> 42:45.815
You know, Storm, you’re not
coming through on my radio,

42:45.857 --> 42:47.609
so press the mic
and then talk.

42:47.650 --> 42:49.736
Thirty meters [garbled
radio chatter] quarter.

42:49.778 --> 42:52.614
Hey, Jason, can I swing?

42:52.655 --> 42:54.324
Yeah.

42:56.159 --> 42:59.120
Thirty [garbled radio chatter]
meters starboard quarter.

42:59.162 --> 43:00.872
Storm, again, press the mic
and then talk.

43:00.914 --> 43:02.457
<i>I do not hear your distances.</i>

43:02.499 --> 43:04.584
Six meters [garbled
radio chatter] stern.

43:04.626 --> 43:06.044
I don’t hear Storm.

43:06.086 --> 43:09.297
Three meters to V4 off your
[garbled radio chatter].

43:09.339 --> 43:12.634
Kick forward.
Kick forward.

43:12.676 --> 43:14.636
Storm, can’t hear.

43:14.678 --> 43:17.055
Two meters to V4 [garbled
radio chatter] quarter.

43:17.097 --> 43:20.141
And Storm, again, press
your mic and then talk.

43:20.183 --> 43:21.851
Ugh!
We’re gonna hit.

43:21.893 --> 43:26.940
One meter...
oh!

43:26.981 --> 43:29.526
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:29.567 --> 43:30.902
[cheering]

43:30.944 --> 43:32.862
Yay, they’re having fun.

43:35.699 --> 43:37.242
Getting back together

43:37.283 --> 43:40.328
with my ex,
Dave is going to be upset.

43:41.830 --> 43:43.081
I don’t know what runs through

43:43.123 --> 43:44.582
Dave’s head at
the best of times.

43:46.710 --> 43:47.836
Something is definitely wrong.

43:47.877 --> 43:49.170
Kyle?

43:49.212 --> 43:51.297
It’s, like, literally
paining so much.

43:51.339 --> 43:53.341
I need to get him help quickly.

43:56.261 --> 43:57.804
-Seriously, this wind.
-Ooh!

43:57.846 --> 43:59.055
Uh-oh.

43:59.097 --> 44:00.890
Carlos, I can’t get the
stabilizers on.

44:00.932 --> 44:03.601
Oh, not again.

44:03.643 --> 44:05.020
Hang on, everybody.

44:05.895 --> 44:07.897
<i>Hang on, hang on.</i>
