10:03.690 --> 10:04.865
but wouldn't you like to
embarrass Starfleet

10:04.908 --> 10:06.083
with a show of strength?

10:06.127 --> 10:07.389
We're here against orders.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.565
Helping us will make them
look weak.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.394
Hmm. That does sound enticing.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.483
I've never heard
of a Trynar Shield.

10:14.526 --> 10:15.571
Just destroy it.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.399
No can do, Tendi Two.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.096
The Cerritosjust doesn't have
the weapons for it.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.272
We need a ship with enough
firepower to punch a hole.

10:21.316 --> 10:22.796
We'd just be borrowing it,
really.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.101
We'll give it right back.

10:24.145 --> 10:25.799
Um, it's a warship,

10:25.842 --> 10:27.670
not a used copy
of Sword and Scabbard.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.498
I know, it's a big ask,

10:29.541 --> 10:31.021
but I wouldn't have come to you
if it wasn't an emergency.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.893
This guy has my friend, D'Erika.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.285
I'm overseeing the merger

10:34.329 --> 10:36.070
of two massive
criminal enterprises.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.941
I can't collude with
the Federation right now.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.421
Sorry, sis.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.553
We understand, Mistress D'Erika.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.686
We thank you for
your consideration.

10:43.730 --> 10:44.687
We'll have to find another...

10:44.731 --> 10:48.038
I demand Barter By Combat!

10:48.082 --> 10:49.910
[gasps]

10:54.828 --> 10:58.179
[grunts] All right, G.D.,
let's hope this old tub

10:58.222 --> 10:59.615
can make it to warp.

11:01.356 --> 11:02.705
Com-Computer, what the hell?!

11:02.749 --> 11:04.620
COMPUTER:
Proximity alert.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.143
[gasps]
Oh, [bleep].

11:08.102 --> 11:10.713
[Mariner grunts]

11:14.195 --> 11:16.545
COMPUTER:
Shields at 90%.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.721
My Trynar Shield works
both ways.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.592
It keeps ships out and in.

11:20.636 --> 11:23.508
Yeah, I guess it slipped my mind
because the name is so stupid.

11:23.552 --> 11:26.337
Oh, the three Bynars, right.
Can you have three Bynars?

11:26.381 --> 11:28.644
Look, why don't you just
dock at the station?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.211
If you really don't want
to join me,

11:30.254 --> 11:31.995
I'll send you on your way.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.910
And let you get your hands
on a planetary murder machine?

11:33.954 --> 11:35.520
Uh, no, thanks.

11:35.564 --> 11:36.783
I'm offering you
the chance of a lifetime.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.089
-You could be part...
-Nope.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.193
D'ERIKA: The rules of Barter
By Combat are simple.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.847
Each side selects a warrior.

11:57.891 --> 12:00.284
If yours defeats mine,
I'll lend you a battleship.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.417
But if you lose,
your captain will

12:02.460 --> 12:04.680
surrender the Cerritosto me.

12:06.508 --> 12:07.814
Deal.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.384
Ah!

12:13.428 --> 12:14.864
She's like a Shaxs-and-a-half.

12:14.908 --> 12:15.865
Are you sure we have anyone
who can take her?

12:15.909 --> 12:18.259
Oh, yeah, we've got this.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.697
The Cerritoschampion will be...

12:21.741 --> 12:24.047
-You like that?
-[grunting]

12:24.091 --> 12:25.919
...Dr. Migleemo.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.530
[chokes]
What?!

12:28.573 --> 12:30.097
[laughter]

12:33.013 --> 12:35.015
Come on, come on.
I need somewhere to hide.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.973
Ooh, dangerous and unpredictable
space debris.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.892
Hang on, G.D.
This is gonna be rough.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.073
Uh...

13:02.346 --> 13:03.957
-[alarm blaring]
-The human has target lock.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.697
[both cry out]

13:05.741 --> 13:07.874
What are you guys doing working
for a jerk like Locarno?

13:07.917 --> 13:09.919
He doesn't care about profit
at all.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.573
That means more profit for us.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.270
What about
Rule of Acquisition 91?

13:13.314 --> 13:15.185
"Your boss is only worth
what he pays you."

13:15.229 --> 13:18.406
Locarno is not our boss.
We make our own decisions.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.669
And you're forgetting rule 289:

13:20.712 --> 13:23.628
shoot first,
count profits later.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.805
[evil laughter]

13:25.848 --> 13:26.849
[straining]

13:30.722 --> 13:32.333
Computer, vent coolant vapor.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.206
[crying out]

13:46.782 --> 13:49.654
Bah! Our sensors are ruined.
We've lost her.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.311
[sighs]

13:57.924 --> 13:59.882
Please, madam,
perhaps we can settle this

13:59.926 --> 14:01.449
over a delicious bowl of slime.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.798
[grunting]

14:04.539 --> 14:05.714
Whoa.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.631
I'm gonna have to start over
with a new therapist, aren't I?

14:09.674 --> 14:12.286
W-W-Whoa! Aah!

14:12.329 --> 14:15.506
-She's going to kill him.
-Dr. Migleemo, fluff your down.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.899
Fluff your down!

14:16.943 --> 14:19.206
-It's embarrassing.
-Just fluff it!

14:19.249 --> 14:21.861
[sinister laughter]

14:21.904 --> 14:23.210
[grunts, squawks]

14:23.253 --> 14:27.127
[sniffling, sneezes]

14:27.170 --> 14:29.172
Bless you, dear.
Wait, what's happening?

14:29.216 --> 14:30.695
I used to train with B'eth.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.915
She has really bad allergies.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.701
Oh-ho! Accept my flappity
fisticuffs, you foul fiend.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.138
Kyah! Kyah!

14:38.181 --> 14:41.924
-[sneezes]
-Ew! The snot.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.753
-[all gasp]
-[Migleemo groans]

14:44.796 --> 14:48.278
The champion of
Barter By Combat is B'eth.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.932
Somebody get her her inhaler.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.368
A deal's a deal, Captain.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.370
The Cerritosis mine.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.336
Transfer your ship's
control codes, Captain,

15:02.379 --> 15:05.295
or our swords will get
considerably bloodier.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.168
[sighs] A deal's a deal,
but you must know

15:08.211 --> 15:09.952
Locarno was only out
for himself.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.649
He's attacked your kind as well.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.738
Oh, I'll deal with him
in my own time.

15:19.135 --> 15:22.834
Wait. I have something
you want more than the Cerritos.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.359
[laughs]
I'm a pirate queen, sister.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.056
What would I want more
than a ship?

15:27.100 --> 15:30.407
-Me.
-[all gasp]

15:30.451 --> 15:32.148
-Tendi, what are you doing?
-Look,

15:32.192 --> 15:33.845
you've wanted the Mistress
of the Winter Constellations

15:33.889 --> 15:35.673
back working for the family
for years.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.849
If you give us a battleship,
I'll come back.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.068
-No!
-Tendi, you can't...

15:39.112 --> 15:41.592
Silence!
Having you back at my side

15:41.636 --> 15:44.073
would mean more than
some measly support ship.

15:44.117 --> 15:46.075
The Cerritosis not measly.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.598
She is the gem of the Calif...

15:47.642 --> 15:48.686
Andy, shut up.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.384
You have a deal, sister.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.516
We have an Orion destroyer
for your rescue.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.649
But I expect you to return here

15:54.692 --> 15:56.433
even if you fail
to save your friend.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.305
We won't.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.268
MARINER:
Damn, warp drive's out,

16:05.312 --> 16:07.140
life support's damaged.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.359
I hate to say it, but I think
I got to set you off somewhere

16:09.403 --> 16:11.840
before anyone catches up.
Sorry, buddy.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.408
Computer, are there any lifeless
planets in this system?

16:14.451 --> 16:17.672
COMPUTER:
Detrion 9 is incapable
of supporting life.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.630
Well, sounds like a party.
Plot a course.

16:31.425 --> 16:34.645
FREEMAN:
Whoa, look at the size
of that thing.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.387
Uh, Captain, we have a problem.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.781
Ugh! Get me that Orion.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.565
Captain Freeman.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.046
A pleasure to speak again
so soon.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.266
This warship is totally
inoperable.

16:46.309 --> 16:48.094
You said you were going
to help us.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.748
I said I would lend you
theRetribution.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.837
We never discussed
its condition.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.013
This isn't fair!

16:54.056 --> 16:56.885
No. But it is extremely Orion.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.582
See you soon, D'Vana.

16:59.148 --> 17:00.758
Billups, report.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.891
This thing's a relic.
Half the systems are fried.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.719
It could take months
to get it battle-ready.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.547
FREEMAN:
We don't have months.

17:06.589 --> 17:08.679
Don't worry, Captain, I've got
my best team working on it.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.290
We could skip life support.
Maybe reroute the shields.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.988
We need to disassemble
the warp drive,

17:13.031 --> 17:14.337
not to mention the conduits.

17:14.381 --> 17:15.817
Who cares about the conduits,
Livik?

17:15.859 --> 17:17.688
We should focus on
firepower and engines.

17:17.732 --> 17:20.691
You can't just activate some
systems; they're dependent.

17:20.734 --> 17:22.040
They don't have to be!

17:22.084 --> 17:23.954
Guys, we need to get
on the same page.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.522
I believe I can facilitate that.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.611
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh,
oh, my gosh.

17:27.655 --> 17:28.917
Are you gonna do a mind meld?

17:28.960 --> 17:32.094
Something less invasive.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.444
-[upbeat piano music playing]
-[ship horn blows]

17:34.488 --> 17:37.273
RUTHERFORD: Well, I'll be
happier than a milkman's horse.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.710
You know what you're
talking about, Mr. Livik.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.148
And you are a heapin' helpin'

17:42.191 --> 17:45.325
of country-fried intellect,
my genteel friend.

17:45.368 --> 17:48.719
I do declare, we've settled
upon a compromise.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.025
Why does this work?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.071
Illogical tactics
can sometimes lead

17:52.114 --> 17:53.507
to logical solutions.

17:53.550 --> 17:56.031
[sniffles] It's beautiful.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.076
[thunder rumbling]

17:57.119 --> 17:59.295
MARINER: What the hell is that?

17:59.339 --> 18:01.080
COMPUTER:
A level seven ion storm.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.908
Recommend an alternate heading,
or damage will occur.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.432
[thunder rumbling]

18:09.175 --> 18:11.960
[grunts]
Oh, [bleep] Romulans!

18:14.745 --> 18:16.312
Starfleet swine!

18:16.356 --> 18:17.922
Cease your pathetic
attempts to flee

18:17.966 --> 18:19.533
and hand over the Device.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.448
MARINER: Huh, never thought
I'd see Romulans

18:21.491 --> 18:22.666
taking orders from a human.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.625
We do not take orders.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.975
Locarno's given us the freedom
to scheme at our leisure.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.803
Oh, so you need a human
for your scheming, huh?

18:28.846 --> 18:30.021
You can't do it on your own?

18:30.065 --> 18:31.980
False! He is a pawn in our game

18:32.023 --> 18:33.547
of 12-dimensional chess!

18:33.590 --> 18:35.505
-That's right, Mariner.
-Aah!

18:37.725 --> 18:39.161
It may be hard
for you to believe,

18:39.205 --> 18:41.120
but we are a coalition
of equals.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.947
One that has you surrounded.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.611
LOCARNO: That storm
is only getting worse.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.744
Power down engines
and we can start over

18:56.787 --> 18:57.788
-without any...
-[grunts]

18:57.832 --> 18:58.876
Hey, stop!

19:02.576 --> 19:04.708
What are you doing?
That storm will rip you apart.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.319
Aw, damn it!

19:06.362 --> 19:07.972
What are you worried about?
We're fine.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.365
She won't last ten minutes
in there.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.411
Then we'll lose
our bargaining power.

19:11.454 --> 19:14.414
Ugh, get in there
and get that Device.

19:14.457 --> 19:17.591
I'm sorry, are you
giving me an order?

19:17.634 --> 19:19.462
I thought we were
a coalition of equals.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.943
We can still profit
without a Genesis bomb.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.640
We need to be powerful.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.642
You cowards. I'll do it myself.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.780
[static crackling]

19:32.823 --> 19:35.261
[thunder rumbling]

19:46.750 --> 19:48.535
[bleep]

19:48.578 --> 19:50.493
Oh, this is getting old,
Beckett.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.713
Hand over the Device
before we get ripped apart.

19:52.756 --> 19:55.759
Whew, he is obsessed
with you, girl.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.587
Nick, I know why
you hate Starfleet.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.285
And it isn't because
you have some deep connection

19:59.328 --> 20:01.243
with junior officers.
You're pissed because

20:01.287 --> 20:02.810
you got booted from the Academ.

20:02.853 --> 20:05.378
LOCARNO:
I am not. I've read your file.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.162
I hate command structure
just like you.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.077
No, I-I don't always agree
with orders, sure,

20:09.120 --> 20:10.513
but I believe in the mission.

20:10.557 --> 20:13.124
What about Sito?
She died for no reason.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.126
She gave her life
for what she believed in.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.693
You can't take that from her.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.521
I thought you were smarter
than everyone else.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.523
Sounds like you're just
another apologist

20:20.567 --> 20:22.308
for a broken system.

20:22.351 --> 20:24.266
Hey, Starfleet's not perfect.
They mess up all the time.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.442
But in the end, they're trying
to do what's right.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.096
I didn't take a single shot
at your fleet,

20:28.139 --> 20:29.532
but you put them in danger.

20:29.576 --> 20:30.577
And what about Josh?

20:30.620 --> 20:32.231
That wasn't my fault.

20:32.274 --> 20:35.103
If-if my stupid professors
had just let us practice.

20:35.146 --> 20:37.366
Josh died because
of your ego, man.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.716
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

20:39.760 --> 20:41.327
Locarno.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.937
Something just appeared
outside the system.

20:42.980 --> 20:45.418
It's an Orion destroyer,
and it's massive.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.202
FREEMAN:
This is it, people.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.856
We only get one shot.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.771
Are you ready, acting captain?

20:50.814 --> 20:52.686
I've got this,
but I want you back

20:52.729 --> 20:54.035
to take command
when you're done.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.819
You and me both.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.995
-Really good captain voice.
-Thank you.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.736
Cerritos, I ordered you to--

20:59.780 --> 21:01.129
Hey, who the hell are you?

21:01.172 --> 21:03.174
Acting Captain
Bradward Boimler, sir.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.438
Turn that ship around right no.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.527
Yes, sir. But first I have
to rescue my friend.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.006
You can't get through
that shield.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.052
I'm not. Captain Freeman is.

21:11.095 --> 21:13.184
-Wh-What?
-Helm, take us to full impulse.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.621
I need everything we've got.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.244
Approaching the barrier,
Captain.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.680
-Wait for it.
-Structural integrity's

21:30.724 --> 21:32.203
failing, sir.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.205
Maximum impulse.
The captain's counting on us.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.817
Wait for it. Now!

21:45.216 --> 21:47.306
No, no, no, no, no. No!

21:48.872 --> 21:51.092
[cries out]

22:02.843 --> 22:04.061
Full impulse, before it closes.

22:08.805 --> 22:11.155
Wow, I've never actually seen
someone use the captain's yacht.

22:11.199 --> 22:12.635
I do declare.

22:12.679 --> 22:15.377
You said the shield was
impenetrable.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.379
I didn't know they were gonna
throw a battleship at it.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.381
This is a disaster.
We have to get out of here.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.556
No, stand firm.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.036
You have to follow my orders.

22:22.079 --> 22:25.344
This is my plan
and my system. Huh?

22:25.387 --> 22:27.128
Ugh! Damn Bynars.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.086
Then you can stay here
on your own.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.436
[groans]

22:30.479 --> 22:33.569
[thunder rumbling]

22:33.613 --> 22:36.050
Go ahead and run.
I don't need any of you.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.225
[beep]

22:37.268 --> 22:39.401
Yes! Finally.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.230
Nowhere else to hide,
Lieutenant.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.322
Whoa!

22:49.063 --> 22:50.107
Yes.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.109
Sorry, girl, looks like I got to

22:52.153 --> 22:53.937
take you off the field
right here.

22:53.981 --> 22:55.765
Explosive terraformation
will initiate

22:55.809 --> 22:57.506
in five minutes.

22:57.550 --> 22:59.465
Huh, Ferengi bomb
with a Ferengi voice.

22:59.508 --> 23:01.380
Didn't expect that,
but I like it.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.469
[gasps]

23:03.512 --> 23:05.079
Get away from my Genesis Device.

23:05.122 --> 23:07.081
It's too late, Nick.
I started the countdown.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.778
All right? We have to
clear out of here.

23:08.822 --> 23:11.346
Oh, please. I graduated
top of my class.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.174
You think I don't know how
to disarm a bomb?

23:13.217 --> 23:15.524
First off, you didn't graduate.

23:15.568 --> 23:17.308
[both grunting]

23:17.352 --> 23:20.616
And second, that thing is
too dangerous for anyone.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.313
I could have been
the best pilot in Starfleet.

23:22.357 --> 23:25.055
Don't let that anger
define your life.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.667
You stunned all those crews,
you didn't kill them.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.756
Because deep down
you're not a murderer.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.888
I'm sorry, but I really am.

23:31.932 --> 23:34.021
My perfect life was
taken from me,

23:34.064 --> 23:36.153
and now I'm getting it back.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.547
I'm not moving, Nick.

23:38.591 --> 23:39.853
Then you're a fool.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.384
[gasps] Mom? How did you
get through the shield?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.647
[laughs]
We threw a battleship at it.

23:51.691 --> 23:52.779
Get us out of here.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.781
No. We have to save Locarno.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.479
He's reactivated the shields.
I can't get a lock.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.438
MARINER:
Nick, please come with us.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.222
Mirab, with sails unfurled.

24:01.265 --> 24:04.181
-We're out of time.
-MARINER: Please, Nick!

24:04.225 --> 24:05.618
Full impulse, now.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.626
[frustrated grunt]

24:13.669 --> 24:14.757
-[chimes]
-Ha!

24:14.801 --> 24:16.542
Next time set a shorter timer.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.979
To deactivate detonation,
please insert

24:19.022 --> 24:20.720
two bars of latinum.

24:20.763 --> 24:23.374
They put a paywall on a bomb?!
Stupid Feren...

24:55.189 --> 24:58.540
VASSERY: You willfully
disregarded Starfleet orders.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.847
And I am prepared to take
full responsibility

25:00.890 --> 25:02.631
for my actions, sir.

25:02.675 --> 25:05.504
I should have you charged
with insubordination,

25:05.547 --> 25:07.941
but you managed to open
diplomatic relations

25:07.984 --> 25:09.986
with the Orions
for the first time.

25:10.030 --> 25:13.990
Everyone at Command is...
pleased with your work.

25:14.034 --> 25:16.340
[exhales sharply]
Thank you, Admiral.

25:16.384 --> 25:19.213
And if I may ask,
what happened to

25:19.256 --> 25:21.563
the alien officers
who allied with Locarno?

25:21.607 --> 25:22.956
I imagine they're in hiding.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.914
Since there were no shots fire,

25:24.958 --> 25:27.569
Starfleet avoided repercussion.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.267
Oh, now we have to deal with
the new M-Class planet

25:30.311 --> 25:32.792
that formed when
the Genesis Device exploded.

25:32.835 --> 25:34.750
-FREEMAN: Is it stable?
-Seems so.

25:34.794 --> 25:37.144
We're calling it Locarno
because his atoms

25:37.187 --> 25:38.711
were included in
the transmogrification

25:38.754 --> 25:40.147
of the nebula.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.278
We hope to use the planet
someday

25:41.322 --> 25:42.715
as a home for refugees.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.979
Then I guess he did some good
after all.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.371
There is one last
piece of business

25:47.415 --> 25:49.722
regarding your lieutenant.

25:50.984 --> 25:53.029
-RUTHERFORD: Mariner!
-[laughter]

25:54.770 --> 25:57.338
Hey, easy. I didn't survive
a Genesis explosion

25:57.381 --> 25:58.861
just so I could get
hugged to death.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.123
We're just really happy

26:00.167 --> 26:01.211
-you're back.
-Thanks, Boims.

26:01.255 --> 26:03.649
I feel like I really am back

26:03.692 --> 26:05.520
for the first time in a while.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.174
I've been kind of
all over the place

26:07.217 --> 26:08.305
the past few months.

26:08.349 --> 26:09.916
I was processing
some heavy stuff

26:09.959 --> 26:12.222
and taking it out
on everyone else.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.529
-I'm sorry.
-Apology not accepted.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.270
Because we're here for you
no matter what.

26:16.313 --> 26:18.098
Yeah, I think I have
a handle on it now.

26:18.141 --> 26:21.144
You know, I-I might even try
not self-sabotaging for once.

26:21.188 --> 26:22.668
I'll see how that goes.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.800
Huh, that sounds
remarkably healthy.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.846
Okay, everybody shut up,
me included.

26:26.889 --> 26:28.674
Let's get drunk.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.023
Oh, thank God.
There you are. [chuckles]

26:31.067 --> 26:33.635
-Livik.
-Rutherford.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.245
Wait, I thought you guys
liked each other now.

26:35.289 --> 26:36.899
No, no, no.
Only when we're Twaining.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.901
Perhaps you need to work
on your leadership skills,

26:38.945 --> 26:40.207
Mr. Rutherford.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.644
Oh, boy.
Someone's got captain fever.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.646
Oh, do I sound "captainy"
to you?

26:44.690 --> 26:47.127
Because Ransom was very happy
with my captaining.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.172
I like how this has
in no way gone to your head.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.521
You know what, Boims?

26:50.565 --> 26:52.219
I think this is really
working for you.

26:52.262 --> 26:53.916
This is a good look.
You should tell my mom

26:53.960 --> 26:55.222
-you want captain's lessons.
-BOIMLER: Really?

26:55.265 --> 26:56.615
You think she'd do that?

26:56.658 --> 26:57.877
-Who was that?
-My former commander,

26:57.920 --> 26:59.922
-Captain Sokel.
-What?!

26:59.966 --> 27:02.185
But what if he wanted you
to return to the Vulcan fleet?

27:02.229 --> 27:04.057
After today's events,
I'm sure he did.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.973
But instead, I prefer
to focus my time

27:07.016 --> 27:09.105
on becoming your science bestie.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.020
Oh! Don't you say that
if you don't mean it.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.370
Why would I say anything
I do not mean?

27:13.414 --> 27:15.285
Oh, man, this is the best.
Everything's working out.

27:15.329 --> 27:16.896
Ooh, this is when we chant
"lower decks."

27:16.939 --> 27:18.898
I don't know.
We kinda do it a lot.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.160
Oh, come on. It's my favorite.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.379
Uh... okay, fine.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.643
ALL:
Lower decks! Lower decks!

27:24.686 --> 27:27.471
Lower decks! Lower decks!

27:27.515 --> 27:28.647
Lower decks!
Lower decks!

27:28.690 --> 27:30.561
-[clears throat]
-Oh, hey, Mom.

27:30.605 --> 27:31.693
We were just about to get rowdy.

27:31.737 --> 27:32.694
Do you want to join us?

27:32.738 --> 27:36.306
[sighs] Lieutenant.

27:36.350 --> 27:39.092
You've been requested
to return to Orion.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.007
-Your sister sent a ship.
-Already?

27:41.050 --> 27:43.139
D'Erika doesn't waste any time.

27:43.183 --> 27:44.706
In the spirit of being a pirate,

27:44.750 --> 27:46.316
perhaps you should simply
refuse to go.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.798
No, this is something
I have to do for myself.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.676
This can't be it, right?

27:57.719 --> 28:00.766
I mean, who's gonna help me
with the plasma conduits?

28:00.809 --> 28:03.159
Keep them clear of any buildup
while I'm gone, okay?

28:03.203 --> 28:05.727
-Okey dokey.
-Okey dokey.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.301
Do you think they'll
give her time

28:14.344 --> 28:15.476
to do a little science?

28:15.519 --> 28:16.999
Unlikely but possible.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.697
Something tells me those Orions
have bit off

28:18.740 --> 28:19.959
a lot more than they can chew.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.743
Yeah. Tendi loves Starfleet.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.397
-She'll be back in no time.
-Come on.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.399
We got some lieutenant junior
grading to do.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.053
-When's our next briefing?
-0900.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.751
Something to do with repairs
to the warp manifold.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.884
Hey, that's Rutherford stuff.
You'll have fun.

28:31.927 --> 28:33.189
[weak chuckle] Yeah.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.278
Can't go wrong with
a warp manifold.
