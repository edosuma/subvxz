<i>I PAID AN EXORBITANT

05:29.704 --> 05:31.411
<i>MORE THAN IT

05:49.599 --> 05:55.265

YOU AND I.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.722
<i>AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE

AH, YES, CLIFFORDVILLE.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.134
AND IT WAS
A PLEASANT TOWN?

14:56.229 --> 15:01.395
OF COURSE IT VVAS PLEASANT.
IT VVAS BETTER THAN PLEASANT.

15:01.484 --> 15:06.570
THERE WAS A GIRL THERE,
NAME OF GIBBONS.

15:06.656 --> 15:11.776
FATHER WAS PRESIDENT

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

15:32.890 --> 15:37.475
AND NOW YOU'RE UP.
YOU'RE ALL THE WAY UP.

15:37.562 --> 15:41.100
AND... YOU'RE SIMPLY BORED.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.517
THAT'S VVHAT YOU ARE, MR.
FEATHERSMITH, PLAIN BORED.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.272
IT'S--IT'S WORSE
THAN BORED.

15:51.659 --> 15:55.368
I'M--RUTHLESS NOW.

15:55.455 --> 16:01.121
<i>\... JUST HAVE NO
PURPOSE, NO PLANS.</i>

16:01.210 --> 16:05.955

WHAT ABOUT THIS...
STUFF ON YOUR DOOR?

16:12.889 --> 16:14.505
AVERY
SUCCINCT SUGGESTION

LET ME SUGGEST
A POSSIBLE TRANSACTION.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.030
YOU SAY YOU'RE BORED, YOU'VE
GOT EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.910
THE PLEASURE'S NOT
IN THE POSSESSION,

16:42.001 --> 16:44.834
IT'S IN THE DESPERATE
STRUGGLE TO POSSESS.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.333
THAT'S THE SENSE OF IT,
ISN'T IT, MR. FEATHERSMITH?

16:47.423 --> 16:48.663
GO ON.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.419
<i>LET'S DO THIS.'</i>

16:50.510 --> 16:52.251
LET'S SEND YOU BACK

16:56.349 --> 17:01.219
ACQUIRE, BUILD, CONSOLIDATE-HOVV
DOES THAT SOUND?

17:01.312 --> 17:06.682
MISS DEVLIN, YOU ARE NOT
DEALING WITH A FOOL NOW.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.767
I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR

"SELL YOUR SOUL
FOR A NICKEL"

17:11.364 --> 17:12.604
COUNTRY BUMPKINS.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.234

17:18.871 --> 17:20.487

17:20.580 --> 17:22.867
BUT I VVANT TO LOOK
EXACTLY AS I DID THEN.

17:22.959 --> 17:23.949
THAT'S NUMBER ONE.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.374
AGREED.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.921
<i>NUMBER TWO.'</i>

17:27.003 --> 17:28.460
I VVANT TO HA\/E A
MEMORY OF EVERYTHING

17:28.548 --> 17:30.289
THAT'S OCCURRED
IN THE LAST 5O YEARS.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.546
I DON'T WANT THAT MEMORY
IMPAIRED ONE BIT!

17:33.594 --> 17:35.380
CHECK AGAIN,
MR. FEATHERSMITH.

17:35.429 --> 17:39.297
NUMBER THREE: I VVANT THAT
TOVVN EXACTLY AS IT VVAS

17:39.392 --> 17:41.383
WITH THE SAME PEOPLE
THAT I REMEMBER.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.560
ALL VERY EASILY ARRANGED.
ANYTHING ELSE?

17:44.605 --> 17:48.439
NUMBER FOUR: I WANT IT
TO HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY.

17:48.526 --> 17:52.565
TIME IS OF ABSOLUTELY
NO ESSENCE.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.115
YOU NAME THE HOUR...

17:54.198 --> 17:57.316
THAT IS THE HOUR
YOU SHALL HAVE.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.822
NOW, AS
TO THE PRICE.

17:59.912 --> 18:05.078
YES, MR. FEATHERSMITH,
AS TO PRICE.

18:05.126 --> 18:09.461
WELL, I SUPPOSE
THE STANDARD PAYMENT

18:09.547 --> 18:14.667
IS, UM, WELL, I GUESS
YOU'D CALL IT THE SOUL.

18:14.760 --> 18:19.470
HUH. ON OCCASION,
MR. FEATHERSMITH,

18:19.557 --> 18:23.266
THAT IS A PART OF
THE TRANSACTION.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.599
BUT IN YOUR CASE, VVE
GOT AHOLD OF YOUR SOUL

18:26.647 --> 18:29.230
SOME TIME AGO,
I BELIEVE.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.060
LET ME CHECK THIS.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.160
AH, HERE IT IS.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.828
THERE WAS THE CRASH OF THE
TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEBENTURES,

18:47.918 --> 18:50.205
THE COMPANY YOU'D BOUGHT
AND THEN MANIPULATED.

18:50.296 --> 18:54.506
YOU RUINED SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE
VVITH THAT BIT OF CHICANERY.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.630
THERE WERE FOUR SUICIDES
AS A RESULT.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.510
I BELIEVE THE BULK
OF YOUR SOUL

18:59.597 --> 19:02.464
WENT OVER TO US
SHORTLY THEREAFTER.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.382
THERE ARE SEVERAL
OTHER ITEMS HERE

OH. [tsk tsk]

19:13.527 --> 19:17.646
AH, HERE WE ARE...
INDIRECT MURDERS.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.156
PEOPLE YOU DROVE
TO RUIN AND POVERTY,

19:20.201 --> 19:23.865
HOPELESSNESS,
ULTIMATE DEATH.

19:23.954 --> 19:28.243
NO, MR. FEATHERSMITH,
I'M AFRAID YOUR SOUL

19:28.334 --> 19:30.041

19:51.691 --> 19:54.058
YOU'RE VERY THOROUGH.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.768
WE HAVE TO BE THOROUGH,
MR. FEATHERSMITH.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.901
NOVV, THE COST FOR VVHAT
YOU ASK IS NOMINAL.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.779

20:47.455 --> 20:50.914
CONSIDERING I KNOW
WHERE THE OIL IS

20:50.958 --> 20:54.622
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

20:54.712 --> 20:59.502
AH, THAT'S 1400 ACRES

20:59.592 --> 21:02.926
NOT DISCOVERED UNTIL, UH,

21:02.970 --> 21:05.177

6,000 FEET UNDER IT,
MR. FEATHERSMITH,

37:25.285 --> 37:28.653

37:30.540 --> 37:34.158
THE OIL CAN'T BE TAKEN
OUT OF THE GROUND.
