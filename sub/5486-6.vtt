08:05.939 --> 08:07.738
Look, I'm ready
to start talking.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.309
- Thank you so much.
My prayers have been answered.

08:10.310 --> 08:12.379
- Look, I'm sorry about before,
and I just want to say

08:12.379 --> 08:14.209
the reason I didn't want you
to come on the trip

08:14.220 --> 08:14.490
is because I've been really
emotional about my dad,

08:14.490 --> 08:17.319
is because I've been really
emotional about my dad,

08:17.319 --> 08:21.218
and I didn't want you
to see me cry.

08:21.220 --> 08:22.720
- I get it.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.158
- Okay. Look, I thought...

08:25.160 --> 08:26.869
I thought maybe
to make it up to you,

08:26.870 --> 08:30.059
we could take a slight detour.

08:30.060 --> 08:32.460
- Are we in Catoosa, Oklahoma?

08:32.470 --> 08:33.769
- We sure are, pal.

08:33.769 --> 08:37.469
- Eddie. Eddie.

08:37.470 --> 08:41.700
- There it is, Eddie
from "Frasier's" grave.

08:41.710 --> 08:43.678
- My book says this is
the holy grail

08:43.679 --> 08:44.490
of celebrity pet monuments.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.615
Of celebrity pet monuments.

08:45.615 --> 08:47.669
- Yeah, yeah, you told me,
several times.

08:49.149 --> 08:52.088
"Eating tossed salad
and scrambled eggs in heaven."

08:52.090 --> 08:54.519
What the hell
does that even mean?

08:54.519 --> 08:55.950
We'll never know, but...

08:55.960 --> 08:58.489
- It's the theme song.

08:58.490 --> 08:59.759
From "Frasier,"
the show he was on.

08:59.759 --> 09:01.328
- Never saw it.

09:01.330 --> 09:03.899
You know what I liked?
"Hunter."

09:03.899 --> 09:05.198
You ever see "Hunter"?

09:05.200 --> 09:06.568
- Hey, you know,
why don't you...

09:06.570 --> 09:08.068
Why don't you get
in there with Eddie?

09:08.070 --> 09:09.168
I'll take a picture
of both of you guys.

09:09.169 --> 09:10.504
Would you like that?

09:10.505 --> 09:11.698
- Mm-hmm.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.330
- Get in there.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.489
- Let's... let's get a bunch.

09:14.490 --> 09:15.808
- Let's... let's get a bunch.

09:15.809 --> 09:17.450
- Yeah, yeah, go nice and wide.
That's good.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.370
- Okay, smile. Oh, that's great.
We got it right there.

09:19.379 --> 09:21.208
We got it.
- Wait, Dr. C.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.570
Dr. C!

09:22.580 --> 09:24.578
- I'll be back
in a couple hours.

09:24.580 --> 09:26.884
- You lied to me! You're going
on your secret mission.

09:26.885 --> 09:28.710
- Sorry!
- Of all the times

09:28.720 --> 09:31.424
I have been abandoned
at a celebrity pet grave,

09:31.426 --> 09:33.019
this is the most hurtful!

- Are you kidding me?

09:49.740 --> 09:51.838
Morgan, what the hell
are you doing here?

09:51.840 --> 09:53.509

I do have a secret, and now
I have to make it right.

- Wow. Eric, it's
nice to see you.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.759
Or meet you, I guess.
- Yeah, you too.

10:21.769 --> 10:23.469

didn't introduce me at all.

Didn't want you to come.

[laughs]

10:35.679 --> 10:37.318
Eric, give us one sec, okay?

10:37.320 --> 10:39.109
You son of a bitch.

10:39.110 --> 10:40.409
You had a secret family
the whole time

10:40.419 --> 10:40.850
You had a secret family

10:40.850 --> 10:42.855

told them about me?

10:42.855 --> 10:44.009
Is your name even Dr. C?

10:44.019 --> 10:45.688
- No, I didn't have
a secret family.

10:45.690 --> 10:47.459
Eric only e-mailed me
a month ago.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.099
I didn't want to tell anybody
until I knew it was real.

10:49.100 --> 10:50.820
In case I was being catfished.

10:50.830 --> 10:52.788
- I heard that.

10:52.789 --> 10:54.419
I told you about when
I went to Montreal, right?

10:54.429 --> 10:56.129
- Yeah, and you were...
both: Severely beaten

10:56.129 --> 10:58.235
by a man that you thought was
a female prostitute.

10:58.235 --> 10:59.659
- Okay, we'll talk
about it later.

10:59.669 --> 11:01.269
- Really embarrassing.
- Anyway, I figured

11:01.269 --> 11:03.668
we'd stop here on the way
and sort things out.

11:03.669 --> 11:06.769
Eric, how'd you find me anyway?

11:06.769 --> 11:08.639
- Well, I asked my mom
for years who my dad was

11:08.639 --> 11:10.139
and then finally she told me
that she met

11:10.139 --> 11:10.409
a handsome, young
med student named Dan

11:10.419 --> 11:12.914
a handsome, young
med student named Dan

11:12.916 --> 11:14.808
at a Billy Joel concert in 1999.

11:14.809 --> 11:17.610
- Evelyn, she was the only
other person in the crowd

11:17.620 --> 11:20.489
that knew all the words to
"We Didn't Start the Fire."

11:20.490 --> 11:22.219
- I just can't believe
you're here, Dad!

11:22.220 --> 11:24.259
- Whoa, whoa.
- Easy.

11:24.259 --> 11:26.399
- Eric, honey, your friends
are too early for the party.

11:26.399 --> 11:29.859
I got to get the pizza at
the gas station. Oh, my God!

11:29.860 --> 11:31.658
Dan, is that you?

11:31.659 --> 11:34.158
- Evelyn, hi.

11:34.159 --> 11:35.490
You haven't changed.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.298
- What did you do, Eric?

11:38.299 --> 11:40.099
- Eric, you want to talk?

11:40.100 --> 11:40.409
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

11:40.419 --> 11:41.609
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

11:41.610 --> 11:44.850
- Okay.
Let's go out back.

11:46.980 --> 11:49.178
- All right.

11:49.179 --> 11:53.078
Oh, hey, you got a swing.
- Yeah.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.509
- You want me
to give you a push?

11:54.519 --> 11:56.849
- No, no, maybe later.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.610
- So you got
a birthday coming up.

11:58.620 --> 12:00.119
- Yeah, next week,

12:00.120 --> 12:01.918
but I convinced mom
to let me have the party today

12:01.919 --> 12:03.418
because I knew you were coming.

12:03.419 --> 12:06.389
I just wanted my friends
to see that I had a dad,

12:06.399 --> 12:09.798
especially Tyler.
He's got two dads.

12:09.799 --> 12:10.419
- Yeah, I know where
you're coming from.

12:10.421 --> 12:11.599
- Yeah, I know where
you're coming from.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.134
I mean, my dad,
he wasn't around much.

12:14.135 --> 12:16.899
But I need you to know
the only reason I wasn't here

12:16.899 --> 12:18.099
is because I didn't
know about you.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.969
- Thanks.
That means a lot.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.870
- But hell,
we could start right now.

12:22.879 --> 12:25.979
Anything I could do?
Anything you need?

12:25.980 --> 12:27.788
- Yeah, I just need for you
to move to Oklahoma

12:27.789 --> 12:30.809
and marry my mom.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.418
- Well, I'm so glad you guys
could make it out here.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.119
It's been a great place
to raise Eric.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.450
You know, everyone owns a gun
here, so there's no crime.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.418
It's just accidents
and suicides.

12:40.419 --> 12:41.159
It's just accidents
and suicides.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.129
- Wow.
Speaking of accidents,

12:43.129 --> 12:45.259
Eric seems like a real winner.

12:45.259 --> 12:47.259
- Yeah, I just
can't believe he's 16.

12:47.259 --> 12:49.789
He's growing like a weed.

12:49.799 --> 12:51.034
- Yeah, he is really tall.

12:51.036 --> 12:53.330
- Oh, he's the tallest one
in his grade.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.674
At the fair, he got a
blue ribbon for reaching things.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.399
It's kind of a boring town.

12:58.409 --> 13:00.339
- That's really curious.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.370
Eric doesn't seem
to take after you or Dr. C,

13:02.379 --> 13:04.749
tall, blue eyes.

13:04.750 --> 13:08.119
- Oh. Oh, no, I just
have bad posture now,

13:08.120 --> 13:10.418
but I was just as tall as him
when I was growing up.

13:10.419 --> 13:10.490
But I was just as tall as him
when I was growing up.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.288
- Hmm.

13:12.289 --> 13:15.119
- And that's our angel, Leo.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.820
- Hmm, seems like
the perfect little family.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.889
- Yeah.
I'm really lucky.

13:20.889 --> 13:22.658
Oh, God, she has
her pants off in that one.

13:22.659 --> 13:24.490
- So what's my brother like?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.869
He's got a much better name
than stupid Eric.

13:26.870 --> 13:28.304
- What?
Eric's a great name.

13:28.306 --> 13:30.298
It's not stupid.
I know a lot of great Erics.

13:30.299 --> 13:32.529
- Okay, name one.

13:32.539 --> 13:34.109
- Eric Stoltz, okay.

13:34.110 --> 13:35.979
He was almost in
"Back to the Future."

13:35.980 --> 13:38.818
- Michael J. Fox replaced him,
like, two weeks into filming.

13:38.820 --> 13:40.269
- Yeah, you're right.

13:40.279 --> 13:40.419
Look, if I had been there,
I would have named you

13:40.421 --> 13:42.288
Look, if I had been there,
I would have named you

13:42.289 --> 13:43.678
something cool, like Lionel.

13:43.679 --> 13:45.610
- Lionel?
- Yeah.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.318
- God, that's such a great name.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.328
Why are you even here,
to brag about your awesome life

13:49.330 --> 13:51.179
and then just go back
to New York?

13:51.190 --> 13:52.489
- No, no, no.
I wanted to meet you.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.759
I was passing through
to go to California.

13:54.759 --> 13:56.595
You know, my... my dad
had a heart attack.

13:56.596 --> 13:58.088
- Grandpa had a heart attack?

13:58.090 --> 14:00.590
- You didn't even know him.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.698
Look, I don't want to go.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.869
I mean, he wasn't a great dad.

14:03.870 --> 14:07.509
- Neither were you, you dick.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.419
- These are beautiful
family photos.

14:10.421 --> 14:12.178
- These are beautiful
family photos.

14:12.179 --> 14:14.448
Interesting, he's got brown eyes
and she's got brown eyes.

14:14.450 --> 14:16.539
But this old man,

14:16.549 --> 14:18.278
brown eyes.

14:18.279 --> 14:20.249
- You know, I think Eric
got his blue eyes

14:20.250 --> 14:22.318
from somebody on
Danny's side of the family.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.889
- Ah, yeah, probably.

14:24.889 --> 14:27.629
There's just one little problem
with your theory there, lady.

14:27.629 --> 14:29.619
It's garbage.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.750
- What?
- Yeah.

14:30.759 --> 14:32.629
- Why?

14:32.629 --> 14:34.399
- Because that man's fiancée
had me dig through his genealogy

14:34.399 --> 14:35.959
to find out
if there was any chance

14:35.960 --> 14:37.528
that she could have
blue-eyed children.

14:37.529 --> 14:39.028
And I still have
the scratch marks

14:39.029 --> 14:40.409
from when I told her
it was impossible.

14:40.419 --> 14:40.870
From when I told her
it was impossible.

14:40.870 --> 14:42.568
You're busted.
- Okay, I admit it.

14:42.570 --> 14:44.568
Danny is not Eric's dad.

14:44.570 --> 14:45.975
Eric's real dad is a big jerk

14:45.975 --> 14:47.869
and he wanted
nothing to do with us.

14:47.870 --> 14:50.669
- Okay, got it. Go outside and
tell him the truth right now!

14:50.679 --> 14:52.178
- That's gonna crush Eric.

14:52.179 --> 14:54.408
It's his 16th birthday,

14:54.409 --> 14:57.479
and I don't have enough money
to get him a car

14:57.480 --> 14:59.948
or even get him
a name-brand cake.

14:59.950 --> 15:01.749
- Spider hero?

15:01.750 --> 15:03.119
Okay, don't care.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.019
You need to get out there
and make it right, Mama.

15:05.019 --> 15:07.250
- Can we please just wait
till after the party?

15:07.259 --> 15:09.428
He's just so happy
to have Danny here.

15:09.429 --> 15:10.419
Please.

15:10.419 --> 15:10.570
Please.

15:10.571 --> 15:13.158
- [sighs] Yeah, I guess so.

15:13.159 --> 15:15.158
I mean, they do seem
to be getting along.

15:15.159 --> 15:17.028
Oh, God!

15:17.029 --> 15:18.559
- Oh, my God!

15:18.570 --> 15:20.875
- Hey, get off him, kid.
Pick on someone your own size.

15:20.875 --> 15:21.929
Come on! Oh, oh, oh!

15:21.940 --> 15:24.408
- No, no, no.
Let him go. Let him go.

15:24.409 --> 15:26.379
Okay, let him hit me
if he wants to hit me, okay?

15:26.379 --> 15:27.739
- No.
- Yes.

15:27.740 --> 15:28.570
Castellano men
express their feelings

15:28.580 --> 15:29.815
through fighting or dancing.

15:29.816 --> 15:31.539
It's either
the fists or the foot.

15:31.549 --> 15:33.448
- Except he's not a Castellano.

15:33.450 --> 15:34.948
- [gasps] What?

15:34.950 --> 15:36.649
- Stop it.
You knew already.

15:36.649 --> 15:38.219
- You?
- I just found out.

15:38.220 --> 15:40.418
- Eric...

15:40.419 --> 15:41.558
- Eric...

15:41.559 --> 15:43.688
Danny is not your dad.

15:43.690 --> 15:46.088
- What?
He's not?
