02:35.359 --> 02:37.053
Christine.

02:37.397 --> 02:38.981
Christine.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.304
Christine!

02:46.387 --> 02:47.912
She's hungry.

03:24.279 --> 03:27.164
He's never coming for us, is he?

03:27.189 --> 03:28.722
Wayne?

03:29.670 --> 03:31.837
I don't know.

03:36.413 --> 03:40.498
I should have known he was a
liar when he said I was special.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.491
Look at me.

03:45.988 --> 03:47.773
Hey.

03:47.798 --> 03:50.381
I'm gonna take care of
you just like I promised.

03:50.406 --> 03:54.575
OK? I'll get a job. I'll find
us a place to stay, all of us.

03:57.016 --> 04:00.107
We don't need him.

04:00.132 --> 04:02.318
Christine, we don't need Wayne.

04:04.298 --> 04:06.249
I know.

04:11.503 --> 04:13.037
She's wet.

04:14.662 --> 04:17.701
- Do you want me to...
- No, no, I've got her.

04:40.198 --> 04:42.116
Excuse me, young man.

04:42.696 --> 04:44.696
Young man?

04:45.472 --> 04:46.996
Can I help you?

04:47.021 --> 04:48.654
What?

04:48.679 --> 04:51.722
Is there anything I can do... to help you?

04:53.518 --> 04:55.485
No, I'm fine.

04:55.510 --> 04:57.636
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

04:59.969 --> 05:01.745
It's my ride.

05:03.984 --> 05:05.769
God bless you.

05:08.006 --> 05:09.474
Hey!

05:09.758 --> 05:12.863
You just go around asking
people if they need help?

05:13.645 --> 05:15.058
Yeah.

05:15.887 --> 05:17.636
Does anyone ever say yes?

05:18.539 --> 05:20.590
All the time.

05:44.672 --> 05:47.507
Christine!

05:47.594 --> 05:49.144
Christine!

05:49.169 --> 05:51.421
Christine! Christine!

05:51.446 --> 05:53.412
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:53.437 --> 05:56.439
No, no, no. Hey, hey, it's OK.

05:56.464 --> 05:58.415
Christine!

05:58.440 --> 06:00.356
Christine!

06:04.636 --> 06:06.721
Christine!

06:08.372 --> 06:11.175
It's OK, it's OK. It's OK...

06:14.505 --> 06:16.123
Christine!

_

13:52.046 --> 13:55.015
Sorry. I got lost comin' off the highway.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.828
I tried to call you.

14:00.147 --> 14:02.765
The battery on my phone died.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.984
Where is she?

14:26.197 --> 14:28.665
What are you doing?

14:29.799 --> 14:31.760
I'm closing her eyes.

14:31.785 --> 14:33.205
You can't touch her.

14:33.230 --> 14:35.698
- Why not?
- Because she's...

14:36.459 --> 14:38.677
it's a fuckin' crime scene.

14:39.399 --> 14:41.775
You told me on the phone
she did this to herself.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.801
No one's gonna fuckin' believe that.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.721
I believe it.

14:49.294 --> 14:51.033
I brought her here.

14:53.342 --> 14:55.693
I beat her. I tied her up...

14:55.718 --> 14:57.787
And then you tried to let her go,

14:57.812 --> 15:00.396
but she wouldn't let that happen.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.289
She wanted you to pay.

15:04.436 --> 15:07.248
She knew if she did this
that it'd hurt you...

15:08.624 --> 15:10.669
'cause you're a good man, Kevin.

15:22.177 --> 15:24.272
If you touch her...

15:28.024 --> 15:30.482
we're in this together.

15:45.081 --> 15:47.276
Then let's be in it.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.252
I have shovels in my trunk.

16:30.847 --> 16:32.555
Wait.

16:34.232 --> 16:36.166
I, uh...

16:36.191 --> 16:38.476
I marked a passage.

16:39.528 --> 16:41.378
Oh. OK.

16:44.344 --> 16:45.845
What?

16:45.870 --> 16:47.347
You should read it.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.893
- Oh, no. No, thanks.
- Why not?

16:52.157 --> 16:54.073
Because I don't believe it, Matt.

16:55.371 --> 16:57.354
I'm sure she didn't, either.

17:05.645 --> 17:07.797
Did you ask for my help, Kevin?

17:09.595 --> 17:11.096
Yes.

17:11.550 --> 17:13.219
This is me helping.

17:22.576 --> 17:24.695
Just the highlighted part.

17:25.729 --> 17:27.845
It can get wordy.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.938
"If I go to the East, He is not there.

17:36.963 --> 17:39.598
If I go to the West, I do not find Him.

17:40.341 --> 17:43.842
When He is at work in the
North, I do not see Him.

17:43.867 --> 17:46.759
When He turns to the South,
I catch no glimpse of Him.

17:47.091 --> 17:50.393
But He knows the way that I take."

17:51.996 --> 17:55.868
"When He has tested me, I
will come forth as gold."

17:59.592 --> 18:02.511
"My feet have closely followed His steps

18:03.045 --> 18:06.063
and have kept to His way
without turning aside.

18:06.528 --> 18:08.602
I have not departed... "

18:12.673 --> 18:17.309
"Not departed from the
commandment of His lips.

18:17.334 --> 18:21.320
I have treasured the words of his
mouth more than my daily bread."

18:23.029 --> 18:27.699
"But He stands alone,
and who can oppose Him?"

18:29.195 --> 18:31.835
"He does whatever He pleases.

18:33.212 --> 18:36.012
He carries out His decree against me,

18:36.037 --> 18:39.210
and many such plans He still has in store."

18:47.095 --> 18:50.013
"That is why I am terrified before Him."

18:52.230 --> 18:54.315
"When I think of all this,

18:54.340 --> 18:56.341
I fear Him.

18:56.366 --> 19:00.085
God has made my heart faint."

19:03.420 --> 19:05.980
"The Almighty has terrified me."

19:09.216 --> 19:11.777
"Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,

19:12.264 --> 19:16.651
by the thick darkness that covers my face."

19:25.785 --> 19:27.369
Amen.

19:51.049 --> 19:53.684
I brought you a change of clothes.

19:55.005 --> 19:58.124
Pardon the fashion. They're donated.

19:59.526 --> 20:02.954
I'd have brought you some of mine,
but we have different physiques.

20:43.281 --> 20:45.365
Better?

20:46.344 --> 20:47.789
Yeah.

20:48.016 --> 20:49.304
Good.

20:49.952 --> 20:51.461
Let's go home.

21:02.539 --> 21:06.084
ATFEC agents exchanged fire with Gilcrest

21:06.109 --> 21:08.827
before he staged a daring escape.

21:08.852 --> 21:11.097
A tri-state manhunt is underway.

21:11.122 --> 21:14.591
At this point, no other
agencies are involved.

21:14.616 --> 21:18.085
In business news, at the
Chicago Board of Trade,

21:18.110 --> 21:20.244
corn, wheat, and soybean prices...

21:29.144 --> 21:30.644
Hey! What the... hey!

21:30.669 --> 21:32.169
Calm down!

21:32.194 --> 21:33.660
Ow!

21:33.685 --> 21:35.686
I had to. There was no other choice.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.495
What the fuck did you do?!

21:37.520 --> 21:38.770
Aah! Fuck!

21:38.914 --> 21:41.448
Aah! Please get the fuck off of me!

21:41.473 --> 21:42.806
I'm sorry!

21:42.831 --> 21:44.331
Get the fuck off of me!

21:44.356 --> 21:46.439
- Why did you do this?!
- So sorry!

21:46.464 --> 21:48.048
Get the fuck off of me!

21:48.073 --> 21:50.325
This is a mistake, a mistake.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.051
I have a daughter.

21:52.076 --> 21:54.777
Someone needs to call my daughter!

21:55.271 --> 21:57.139
I'm not supposed to be here!

21:57.314 --> 22:00.766
This is a mistake!
Someone call my daughter!

22:03.245 --> 22:05.847
I'm not supposed to be here!

22:07.648 --> 22:10.066
This is a mistake!

22:11.650 --> 22:13.818
I'm not fucking crazy!

22:14.447 --> 22:17.074
Just calm down. Calm down. Stay calm.

22:17.099 --> 22:19.600
You're OK. Just calm down.

22:19.625 --> 22:22.053
Stay calm. You're OK.

22:22.078 --> 22:24.128
Just calm down. Stay calm. You're OK.

22:24.153 --> 22:26.455
Just calm down. Stay calm. You're OK.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.863
Just calm...

23:01.219 --> 23:06.014
_

23:27.839 --> 23:30.290
You gonna behave yourself?

23:30.779 --> 23:32.864
Yeah.

23:36.575 --> 23:40.244
I had to ask.

23:44.194 --> 23:46.145
Ten minutes.

23:48.492 --> 23:51.294
Do you usually sleep on that side?

23:51.319 --> 23:53.287
Well, why don't I go to that side? No, no.

23:53.312 --> 23:54.779
I will go to that side of the bed.

23:54.804 --> 23:56.888
Balki, I don't mind sleeping
on that side of the bed.

23:56.913 --> 23:59.154
I'm not arguing about sleeping
on that side of the bed.

23:59.648 --> 24:01.381
Hey, baby boy.

24:02.365 --> 24:03.881
Have a seat.

24:05.265 --> 24:06.715
Dad,

24:06.740 --> 24:08.707
I need to get to a phone.

24:09.023 --> 24:11.282
Jill hasn't heard from me. I got to call...

24:11.307 --> 24:13.391
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

24:17.399 --> 24:18.647
Quiet...

24:19.449 --> 24:21.400
at last.

24:25.626 --> 24:28.128
So you finally fuckin' snapped, huh?

24:28.537 --> 24:31.131
- No.
- No?

24:31.156 --> 24:34.467
- I'm not fucking crazy.
- Neither am I...

24:35.585 --> 24:38.754
but I am a bad man, son,

24:38.779 --> 24:40.788
and the bad men end up here.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.398
Dad, you're... look, you're a good man.

24:43.423 --> 24:46.272
I most definitely am not.

24:46.927 --> 24:49.530
My intentions are good,

24:49.574 --> 24:52.999
but my heart and my mind and my balls, son,

24:53.024 --> 24:56.772
the holy fuckin' Trinity... they all knew.

24:57.210 --> 24:59.161
That night 3 years ago,

24:59.186 --> 25:01.653
we looked at ourselves in the mirror,

25:01.678 --> 25:05.181
and none of us wondered why
we were still fuckin' here.

25:05.206 --> 25:06.705
We knew.

25:06.730 --> 25:08.530
Of course we knew.

25:11.354 --> 25:13.085
You know.

25:13.110 --> 25:14.272
I don't belong here.

25:14.297 --> 25:15.846
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't.

25:15.871 --> 25:17.663
Oh, yes, you... I have to leave here.

25:17.688 --> 25:19.694
There is no leaving here. Now...

25:19.719 --> 25:21.928
Don't you fucking dare!

25:21.953 --> 25:23.870
Do not turn around.

25:23.895 --> 25:26.363
No, no, just get the fuck out of here.

25:26.388 --> 25:30.391
Son, I said do not turn around.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.967
Fuck him.

25:34.117 --> 25:36.034
Turn around.

25:44.064 --> 25:46.148
Hello again.

25:51.252 --> 25:53.253
Now, why'd you go and do that?

25:53.278 --> 25:56.475
He needs to get out,
and you weren't helping,

25:56.500 --> 25:59.624
you crazy, dried-up, fuckin' turd.

25:59.649 --> 26:03.102
Oh, fuck you, you fuckin'
tobacco-stink twat.

26:03.127 --> 26:05.116
He needs to stay.

26:08.415 --> 26:10.350
Is that what you need, Kevin?

26:10.375 --> 26:12.343
This isn't happening.

26:12.996 --> 26:14.964
This isn't real.

26:14.989 --> 26:16.990
You're not here.

26:17.015 --> 26:18.599
It's happenin'.

26:18.624 --> 26:20.291
It's real.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.170
I'm here.

26:31.532 --> 26:32.983
Mmm.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.647
You... you're dead.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.912
You're fucking dead.

26:39.839 --> 26:41.827
I buried you.

26:41.852 --> 26:42.530
Hmm.

26:42.555 --> 26:44.038
Not...

26:44.861 --> 26:46.895
deep...

26:47.969 --> 26:50.087
enough.

26:52.731 --> 26:56.234
Hey, you leave with her...

26:56.813 --> 26:58.946
you leave with her.

26:59.481 --> 27:02.217
Dad. Daddy.

27:02.242 --> 27:04.694
Now, Kevin,

27:04.719 --> 27:06.803
shh.

27:07.279 --> 27:10.832
Looks like we're gonna
be traveling companions.

27:11.374 --> 27:13.194
Until then...

27:14.407 --> 27:16.908
you should wake the fuck up.

27:18.068 --> 27:19.576
What?

27:20.106 --> 27:22.741
Wake the fuck up!

27:26.897 --> 27:28.862
You OK?

27:30.892 --> 27:32.259
Yeah.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.901
Fine.

27:35.649 --> 27:37.567
Where are we?

27:37.592 --> 27:38.917
I got hungry.

27:38.942 --> 27:40.370
Want a cheeseburger?

27:45.488 --> 27:47.105
Mmm.

27:48.996 --> 27:50.947
Mmm.

27:51.663 --> 27:54.115
God, that's good.

27:58.646 --> 28:00.597
So what'd she say?

28:00.622 --> 28:02.269
Who?

28:02.398 --> 28:03.864
Patti.

28:03.889 --> 28:06.391
What'd she say before she killed herself?

28:06.416 --> 28:08.666
I don't want to talk about it.

28:09.016 --> 28:12.066
- I can't help if you don't tell me.
- You've helped me enough, Matt.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.144
Not you. Them.

28:14.169 --> 28:15.503
The Remnant.

28:15.528 --> 28:17.445
You can't help them.

28:18.369 --> 28:21.159
Yes, I can. I know I can
'cause I'm supposed to.

28:21.184 --> 28:23.652
But you need to tell me
why she did what she did.

28:23.677 --> 28:25.620
You need to tell me what she said.

28:27.423 --> 28:29.510
She said...

28:29.800 --> 28:31.751
I understand.

28:32.005 --> 28:33.511
Understood what?

28:33.536 --> 28:34.863
I don't know.

28:34.888 --> 28:36.421
Sure you do.

28:36.919 --> 28:38.878
Excuse me?

28:40.563 --> 28:44.350
If she wanted to deliver a
message by cutting her own throat,

28:44.375 --> 28:48.722
I'm pretty sure she'd be confident
you received it before she did.

28:51.736 --> 28:54.404
So what did you understand?

28:57.213 --> 28:59.276
Why we didn't go.

29:02.013 --> 29:04.097
Why...

29:05.452 --> 29:07.581
we're still here.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.534
Tell me.

29:20.765 --> 29:22.722
Before it happened,

29:23.258 --> 29:25.636
the, uh, the 14th?

29:26.771 --> 29:28.699
I wanted to leave.

29:31.132 --> 29:34.300
I wanted to be free of, uh...

29:37.315 --> 29:39.066
my family.

29:44.614 --> 29:47.167
Wanting and doing aren't the same.

29:50.370 --> 29:52.574
I slept with another woman.

29:57.702 --> 29:59.336
Who?

30:00.708 --> 30:02.729
I don't know her name.

30:02.878 --> 30:07.042
She, uh... she disappeared.

30:08.211 --> 30:11.630
You were... with her?

30:12.244 --> 30:14.829
At the moment of the Departure?

30:15.990 --> 30:17.574
Yeah.

30:20.829 --> 30:22.346
No shit?

30:25.013 --> 30:27.097
What happened next?

30:31.565 --> 30:34.651
I don't really remember all
of it. I think I was in shock.

30:37.422 --> 30:42.050
Phones were down, and, um,
I was... wearing my uniform.

30:43.379 --> 30:46.995
And people kept coming up
to me and asking me for help.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.691
And I couldn't... or I...

30:53.714 --> 30:55.799
I didn't know how.

30:58.933 --> 31:01.276
So I got in my car...

31:02.833 --> 31:05.335
and I went to Jill's
school and I ran inside.

31:08.287 --> 31:11.289
She and Tommy were both there, and...

31:15.398 --> 31:17.440
they were scared.

31:20.569 --> 31:25.378
I just remember the look on
their faces when they saw me.

31:25.403 --> 31:27.988
Um...

31:29.264 --> 31:31.191
They were so...

31:33.130 --> 31:36.633
they were... they were so happy.

31:42.106 --> 31:43.980
They were happy.

31:47.516 --> 31:49.717
And, uh...

31:51.713 --> 31:56.190
we went back to the house, and
Laurie had already gone home, so...

31:56.215 --> 31:57.956
and she was different.

31:57.981 --> 32:00.300
I mean, I think we all were.

32:02.364 --> 32:04.566
But I just wanted to be with them.

32:07.017 --> 32:09.722
And I wanted to hold them.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.058
And then I started to lose them.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.151
One by one.

32:23.395 --> 32:25.526
It's not your fault.

32:27.603 --> 32:30.071
Yes, it is.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.831
It is.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.009
Oh...

33:32.531 --> 33:35.500
Hey, you OK?

33:46.318 --> 33:48.485
Jesus Christ.

33:48.645 --> 33:52.744
Just sitting here. Too many woes.

33:52.769 --> 33:57.080
- Listen, don't move.
- Please, what's your name?

33:57.105 --> 33:59.997
- Kevin.
- Kevin. You need help.

34:00.022 --> 34:02.494
No, Kevin, Kevin, I'm
gonna be dead in a minute.

34:02.519 --> 34:04.400
There's no help for me.

34:07.886 --> 34:11.505
So, please, don't leave me alone.

34:15.637 --> 34:17.088
Sure.

34:17.112 --> 34:19.030
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

34:19.054 --> 34:21.773
- I'm right here.
- Thank you.

34:24.251 --> 34:26.882
Will you do something for me?

34:28.150 --> 34:29.889
A favor...

34:30.449 --> 34:32.929
stranger to stranger?

34:37.371 --> 34:39.570
Will you... will you make a wish?

34:42.447 --> 34:44.531
A what?

34:46.713 --> 34:48.859
I think I may be a fraud.

34:50.464 --> 34:53.297
But... but if... if I'm not,

34:53.322 --> 34:56.991
I can give you anything you want...

34:58.587 --> 35:03.156
and... ... that will mean I was real.

35:04.447 --> 35:07.883
Let me do this f... for you
before I go. Make a wish.

35:07.908 --> 35:11.008
You don't have to say it
out loud. Just think it.

35:32.937 --> 35:35.054
Oh.

35:39.333 --> 35:40.967
Granted.

36:03.871 --> 36:08.157
ATFEC! Get down! Get the fuck down! Now!

36:08.182 --> 36:10.040
Get on the ground now! Hurry up! Get down!

36:10.065 --> 36:12.392
Stay the fuck down! Let's
go! Come on, turn around!

36:12.417 --> 36:13.954
Let's go!

36:14.312 --> 36:15.929
Stay down!

36:15.954 --> 36:17.407
Go!

36:33.481 --> 36:35.933
What did he say to you?

36:35.958 --> 36:38.959
Uh... just asked me my name.

36:38.984 --> 36:40.434
That's it?

36:40.808 --> 36:42.759
Yeah, that's it.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.568
Talk to you about Russia?

36:45.030 --> 36:46.981
No.

36:47.305 --> 36:49.661
Make any physical contact with you?

36:49.686 --> 36:51.136
Why?

36:51.587 --> 36:53.301
Did he?

36:53.981 --> 36:55.431
No.

36:59.557 --> 37:01.508
Who was he?

37:03.008 --> 37:05.926
Just another asshole
who thought he was God.

37:06.908 --> 37:09.716
Excuse me. This man did nothing wrong.

37:09.741 --> 37:13.744
We were just having lunch, and
he's a police officer, a chief.

37:13.769 --> 37:15.687
You're a cop?

37:15.712 --> 37:17.880
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you say so?

37:18.381 --> 37:19.872
I'm off-duty.

37:20.031 --> 37:21.531
Where you from?

37:21.556 --> 37:23.522
New York, uh, Mapleton.

37:24.323 --> 37:27.482
OK, we're good here, Chief.
Thanks for your cooperation.

37:30.426 --> 37:32.010
Go on home to Mapleton.

38:24.490 --> 38:26.608
Stop, now! You...

38:33.172 --> 38:35.882
Hey! Drop the gun!

38:35.907 --> 38:38.192
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's OK.

38:38.334 --> 38:39.833
Calm down.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.819
Drop the gun.

38:43.335 --> 38:45.754
- What's your name?
- What?

38:45.779 --> 38:48.593
Drop the gun. We can talk about
whatever you want to talk about.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.035
Listen, I'm a cop.

38:50.060 --> 38:53.273
Do you... do you see what they did?!

38:54.128 --> 38:56.703
It's all right. Calm
down. Just drop the gun.

38:56.728 --> 38:58.728
Fuck you!

39:01.376 --> 39:02.910
Hey!

39:03.352 --> 39:05.887
I'll kill you, fucker!

39:20.121 --> 39:21.703
Hey!

39:25.315 --> 39:26.848
Kevin!

39:32.914 --> 39:35.549
Jesus Christ.

39:37.670 --> 39:39.471
Can you hear me?

39:43.770 --> 39:45.904
What happened?

39:46.310 --> 39:48.277
What happened?

39:48.483 --> 39:50.367
What the fuck did you people do?

39:50.392 --> 39:53.277
- She's hurt!
- She wants to be fuckin' hurt!

40:05.442 --> 40:07.026
What happened?

40:17.063 --> 40:20.398
_

40:33.595 --> 40:35.513
I'm gonna kill you!

41:10.229 --> 41:12.680
Jesus. Lucy. Lucy!

41:12.958 --> 41:15.893
- You all right?
- You were right.

41:16.209 --> 41:18.176
You were right.

41:18.201 --> 41:19.618
Please!

41:19.643 --> 41:22.595
Go back to your homes, for your own safety!

41:22.620 --> 41:24.037
- Dennis!
- Chief!

41:24.062 --> 41:26.063
- They have not...
- Where the fuck is everybody?!

41:26.088 --> 41:28.039
I can't stop them! They left!

41:28.064 --> 41:29.721
Give me a fuckin' gun.

41:29.746 --> 41:32.166
- Where's all the fire trucks?
- I called them.

41:32.191 --> 41:34.346
They want to wait till the roads clear.

41:34.548 --> 41:37.838
Well, then you clear the fuckin' cars out
of the goddamn road so they can get in!

41:37.863 --> 41:39.529
Chief, nobody wants to help them!

41:39.554 --> 41:41.688
- Get out of my way!
- It's their own fault.

41:41.713 --> 41:44.215
Listen, go back to that
fuckin'... stay at this barricade

41:44.240 --> 41:46.357
and do not let anyone
through, do you understand?

41:46.382 --> 41:47.799
Go!

41:47.824 --> 41:49.775
Step back! Hold it.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.752
Hold this fuckin' line. Step the fuck back!

42:20.077 --> 42:22.278
How dare you?!

42:29.493 --> 42:31.577
Aah!

42:33.583 --> 42:35.968
Oh!

42:37.269 --> 42:39.770
Hey, I'll get you somewhere safe.

42:39.795 --> 42:41.329
I'll get you somewhere safe.

42:41.354 --> 42:43.221
J... Ji...

42:43.246 --> 42:44.546
Huh?

42:44.571 --> 42:47.123
Jill!

44:37.131 --> 44:38.715
You OK?

44:50.796 --> 44:53.931
It's all right. It's all right.

46:05.358 --> 46:07.643
"Dear Kevin,

46:07.668 --> 46:10.670
I need to say good-bye
to someone I care about,

46:10.972 --> 46:15.108
someone who's still here,
so I'm saying it to you."

46:16.908 --> 46:20.843
"You were good to me, Kevin, and
sometimes when we were together,

46:20.868 --> 46:24.287
I remembered who I used to
be before everything changed."

46:27.441 --> 46:29.276
"But I was pretending,

46:29.301 --> 46:32.503
pretending as if I hadn't lost everything."

46:35.714 --> 46:39.184
"I want to believe it can all
go back to the way it was."

46:41.885 --> 46:44.210
"I want to believe that
I'm not surrounded by

46:44.235 --> 46:47.023
the abandoned ruin of a dead civilization."

46:51.128 --> 46:54.538
"I want to believe it's still
possible to get close to someone...

46:56.260 --> 46:58.627
but it's easier not to.

46:59.781 --> 47:02.581
It's easier because I'm a coward

47:03.454 --> 47:05.922
and I couldn't take the pain,

47:05.947 --> 47:08.032
not again."

47:08.795 --> 47:11.714
"I know that's not fair, Kevin."

47:13.275 --> 47:17.361
"You've lost so much,
too, and you're strong."

47:18.988 --> 47:21.128
"You're still here."

47:23.596 --> 47:26.902
"But I can't be, not anymore."

47:29.125 --> 47:31.167
"I tried to get better, Kevin.

47:31.192 --> 47:34.964
I didn't want to feel this
way, so I took a shortcut."

47:37.674 --> 47:40.370
"But it led me right back home,

47:40.823 --> 47:44.105
and do you know what I
found when I got there?"

47:45.855 --> 47:48.306
"I found them, Kevin,

47:48.331 --> 47:50.916
right where I left them."

47:54.439 --> 47:56.468
"Right where they left me."

48:00.638 --> 48:03.173
"It took me 3 years to accept the truth,

48:03.198 --> 48:06.533
but now I know there's no
going back, no fixing it."

48:10.435 --> 48:12.611
"I'm beyond repair."

48:15.057 --> 48:17.392
"Maybe we're all beyond repair.

48:18.784 --> 48:21.681
I can't go on the way I'm living...

48:22.837 --> 48:26.072
but I don't have the power to die.

48:26.551 --> 48:30.814
But I have to move towards something."

48:34.199 --> 48:36.283
"Anything."

48:37.872 --> 48:41.978
"I'm not sure where I'm going, just away.

48:43.537 --> 48:45.533
Away from all this."

48:48.140 --> 48:52.143
"I think about a place where nobody
will know what happened to me."

48:53.808 --> 48:56.477
"But then I worry I'll forget them."

48:59.900 --> 49:03.493
"I don't ever want to
forget them. I can't."

49:06.170 --> 49:08.767
"They were my family."

49:12.497 --> 49:14.736
"I think I loved you, Kevin.

49:14.761 --> 49:17.346
Maybe you loved me, too."

49:22.166 --> 49:25.658
"I wish I could say this to
you instead of writing it."

49:28.886 --> 49:31.704
"I wish I could see you
one last time to thank you

49:31.729 --> 49:35.587
and wish you well and tell
you how much you mean to me."

49:44.696 --> 49:46.486
"But I can't."

49:51.946 --> 49:54.375
"Like I said, I'm a coward."

49:58.700 --> 50:01.344
"So, wish me luck. Heh!"

50:02.464 --> 50:04.711
"I think I'm going to need it."

50:08.548 --> 50:11.633
"Love, Nora."

50:44.736 --> 50:46.370
Hi.

51:27.587 --> 51:29.751
Look what I found.
