(  upbeat theme playing  )

00:04.208 --> 00:05.458
( grunting )

00:08.083 --> 00:10.041
Hypothetical situation

00:08.083 --> 00:10.041
seven:

00:10.083 --> 00:12.041
You are confronted

00:10.083 --> 00:12.041
with four out of control horses

00:12.083 --> 00:13.542
pulling a wagon

00:12.083 --> 00:13.542
over a cliff.

00:13.583 --> 00:15.709
There's a rescue

00:13.583 --> 00:15.709
we haven't had.

00:15.750 --> 00:16.959
Yet.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.250
Do you: A, tell the sheriff,

00:19.291 --> 00:21.291
B, unhitch the wagon, or--

00:21.333 --> 00:24.667
C, Stop reading

00:21.333 --> 00:24.667
that book.

00:24.709 --> 00:26.458
Heatwave, I am merely attempting

00:24.709 --> 00:26.458
to make sure

00:26.500 --> 00:28.709
we are prepared

00:26.500 --> 00:28.709
for any rescue eventuality.

00:28.750 --> 00:31.291
We've handled plenty

00:28.750 --> 00:31.291
of weird rescues together.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.458
It would take an awful lot

00:31.333 --> 00:33.458
to faze our team.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.000
( alarm buzzing )

00:36.041 --> 00:38.458
That's Optimus Prime's alert.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.875
Optimus, sir.

00:39.917 --> 00:42.250
Rescue Team Sigma Seventeen

00:39.917 --> 00:42.250
awaiting orders.

00:42.291 --> 00:46.250
This mission is for you alone,

00:42.291 --> 00:46.250
Heatwave.

00:46.291 --> 00:50.709
You have proven yourself

00:46.291 --> 00:50.709
ready for a new responsibility.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.166
It is time you grow

00:52.208 --> 00:54.166
into the leader

00:52.208 --> 00:54.166
you were meant to be.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.667
Thank you, sir.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.667
But my team--

00:56.709 --> 00:58.458
Will stay on Griffin Rock

00:58.500 --> 01:01.667
while you meet me

00:58.500 --> 01:01.667
at a secret mainland facility.

01:01.709 --> 01:04.959
Come immediately.

01:01.709 --> 01:04.959
I will send coordinates.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.166
But, sir, I--

01:08.792 --> 01:11.583
Consider our Team fazed.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.000
Hey, here it is, Dad.

01:16.041 --> 01:20.333
Ha-ha. It's about time we got

01:16.041 --> 01:20.333
Grandpa Zachary cleaned up.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.792
The framers said they could

01:20.375 --> 01:22.792
even restore this old wood.

01:22.834 --> 01:26.375
I still don't get why Doctor

01:22.834 --> 01:26.375
Morocco gave us this picture.

01:26.417 --> 01:27.667
Seems too...

01:27.709 --> 01:29.834
Nice.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.834
Right?

01:29.875 --> 01:31.583
Especially after

01:29.875 --> 01:31.583
he tried to steal

01:31.625 --> 01:32.917
the rest of

01:31.625 --> 01:32.917
great gramp's ship.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.875
Well, I'm glad we have this.

01:34.917 --> 01:38.583
Whatever Morocco's

01:34.917 --> 01:38.583
motivation was.

Chief Burns, I need

02:25.917 --> 02:29.000
to request a leave of absence.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.166
Optimus Prime summoned me

02:29.041 --> 02:31.166
to the mainland.

02:31.208 --> 02:34.291
Robots with personalities?

02:34.333 --> 02:37.625
Now, this is

02:34.333 --> 02:37.625
positively riveting.

02:37.667 --> 02:40.417
Permission granted, Heatwave.

02:37.667 --> 02:40.417
What's this about?

02:40.458 --> 02:42.834
I'm, uh...not sure, sir.

02:42.875 --> 02:44.667
I don't even know

02:42.875 --> 02:44.667
how long I'll be gone.

02:44.709 --> 02:46.667
When do you have to go,

02:44.709 --> 02:46.667
Heatwave?

02:46.709 --> 02:49.041
I'm probably already late.

02:50.834 --> 02:54.291
But... Hey, I might have time to

02:50.834 --> 02:54.291
take you to school on the way.

02:54.333 --> 02:55.917
We'll all come.

02:57.959 --> 03:00.542
I need to drop this off downtown

02:57.959 --> 03:00.542
anyhow.

03:05.792 --> 03:11.333
Emotions? A sense of duty?

03:05.792 --> 03:11.333
I know humans with less.

03:11.375 --> 03:14.166
If that artificial

03:11.375 --> 03:14.166
intelligence programming

03:14.208 --> 03:16.250
is as advanced

03:14.208 --> 03:16.250
as it appears,

03:16.291 --> 03:19.750
this begs a little

03:16.291 --> 03:19.750
"hands on" research.

03:21.667 --> 03:25.750
Remember, if you need me,

03:21.667 --> 03:25.750
call me on my com.

03:25.792 --> 03:28.208
Chase, you're in charge

03:25.792 --> 03:28.208
while I'm gone.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.834
Boulder, keep an eye

03:28.250 --> 03:30.834
on Cody for me.

03:30.875 --> 03:33.875
And, Blades, don't stay up late

03:30.875 --> 03:33.875
watching horror movies.

03:33.917 --> 03:37.166
I won't be around to help you

03:33.917 --> 03:37.166
hunt zombie hamsters.

03:37.208 --> 03:39.333
That was one time.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.750
Ahh. I feel like

03:39.375 --> 03:41.750
I'm forgetting something.

03:41.792 --> 03:44.333
Heatwave, you have prepared us

03:41.792 --> 03:44.333
for every eventuality.

03:44.375 --> 03:46.083
Except, of course,

03:44.375 --> 03:46.083
the runaway wagon.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.667
We'll be fine.

03:47.709 --> 03:49.500
Right, I know.

03:49.542 --> 03:50.875
But if you're not,

03:49.542 --> 03:50.875
call me on my com.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.792
( phone rings )

03:52.834 --> 03:54.250
What's up, Doc?

03:54.291 --> 03:56.625
Not wascally wabbits,

03:54.291 --> 03:56.625
I'm afraid.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.583
There appears to be

03:56.667 --> 03:58.583
a strange storm front

03:58.625 --> 04:00.917
moving toward the island

03:58.625 --> 04:00.917
at an alarming rate.

04:00.959 --> 04:04.417
Images from my weather balloon

04:00.959 --> 04:04.417
show what looks like a tornado.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.208
We have to warn the island.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.250
Griffin Rock's not equipped

04:06.250 --> 04:08.250
to handle that weather.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.500
I have a new invention

04:08.291 --> 04:10.500
that may be able

04:10.542 --> 04:15.834
to untwist that twister, if you

04:10.542 --> 04:15.834
can spare Dani and Blades.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.875
Team, we have

04:15.875 --> 04:17.875
a real emergency.

04:17.917 --> 04:20.166
Rescue Bots,

04:17.917 --> 04:20.166
roll to the rescue.

04:21.834 --> 04:24.250
Optimus'll understand

04:21.834 --> 04:24.250
if I'm a little late.

04:24.291 --> 04:27.291
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

04:29.000 --> 04:30.417
( grunts )

04:30.458 --> 04:33.542
Sir, it appears the tornado

04:30.458 --> 04:33.542
is getting closer.

04:36.291 --> 04:38.375
Get into the basement! Now!

04:38.417 --> 04:40.291
Wait, Kade! Look!

04:41.709 --> 04:44.250
Go inside, Cody.

04:41.709 --> 04:44.250
We'll take care of it.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.417
( Cody grunts )

04:51.083 --> 04:53.875
Hey, who wants a free ride

04:51.083 --> 04:53.875
in a fire truck?

04:53.917 --> 04:55.667
Huh? Come on!

05:03.375 --> 05:05.250
( tires squealing )

05:05.291 --> 05:06.750
( both screaming )

05:06.792 --> 05:08.583
Heatwave!

05:06.792 --> 05:08.583
Get us out of here!

05:08.625 --> 05:11.792
I'm...trying! Ugh.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.375
( grunting )

05:16.417 --> 05:17.917
BOULDER:

05:16.417 --> 05:17.917
Heatwave!

05:17.959 --> 05:21.000
Get back, Boulder!

05:17.959 --> 05:21.000
The storm's too strong!

05:21.041 --> 05:23.291
( Boulder grunting )

05:23.333 --> 05:25.417
Good thing I'm stronger!

05:25.458 --> 05:27.417
( grunting )

05:27.458 --> 05:30.709
Power up and energize!

05:31.917 --> 05:33.583
( grunts )

05:33.625 --> 05:35.792
(  dramatic theme playing  )

05:36.750 --> 05:39.041
( cow moos )

05:39.083 --> 05:40.917
I know I'm no weather expert,

05:40.959 --> 05:43.583
but shouldn't we be flying away

05:40.959 --> 05:43.583
from the tornado?

05:43.625 --> 05:46.208
Actually, we need

05:43.625 --> 05:46.208
to get even closer.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.917
When we're directly above it,

05:46.250 --> 05:48.917
we drop this:

05:48.959 --> 05:52.458
The Torna-don't,

05:48.959 --> 05:52.458
my own personal invention.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.583
Inside the twister,

05:52.500 --> 05:55.583
this canister will explode

05:55.625 --> 05:58.375
and change the charge

05:55.625 --> 05:58.375
of the storm's particles,

05:58.417 --> 05:59.709
stopping it cold.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.709
Or...it should.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.208
I've been hoping

06:01.750 --> 06:04.208
to test it.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.542
Test it?

06:05.583 --> 06:07.083
Don't mind if I do.

06:07.125 --> 06:09.000
( sighs )

06:09.041 --> 06:11.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )

06:28.500 --> 06:31.291
( cow moos )

06:40.166 --> 06:42.458
It's a good thing

06:40.166 --> 06:42.458
you came through for us, Doc.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.083
That tornado would have caused

06:42.500 --> 06:45.083
some serious damage.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.542
It seemed like suddenly

06:45.125 --> 06:47.542
it just appeared

06:47.583 --> 06:49.041
without any warning.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.625
That's the odd part.

06:50.667 --> 06:52.792
I want a closer look

06:50.667 --> 06:52.792
at that weather data.

06:52.834 --> 06:54.417
We'll take you back to the lab.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.000
No need, Heatwave.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.208
You have somewhere

06:56.041 --> 06:58.208
more important to be.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.041
( sighs )

07:00.083 --> 07:01.750
Remember, if you need me--

07:01.792 --> 07:03.959
ALL ( in unison ):

07:01.792 --> 07:03.959
Call you on your com.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.875
This is it.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.875
Time to get out.

07:10.917 --> 07:14.041
Uh, no. I'm coming along.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.458
Kade, Optimus

07:14.083 --> 07:16.458
didn't invite you.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.542
Well, someone's gotta drive.

07:18.583 --> 07:22.375
Besides, I thought old OP was

07:18.583 --> 07:22.375
big on Bots working with humans.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.583
Ahh. Fine.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.667
Just don't embarrass me,

07:24.625 --> 07:26.667
all right?

07:30.208 --> 07:32.041
Hi, son.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.041
School get out early?

07:32.083 --> 07:34.959
Yeah. Our teacher was kind of

07:32.083 --> 07:34.959
jumpy after the tornado.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.542
Then this would

07:35.000 --> 07:37.542
knock her kneesocks off.

07:37.583 --> 07:41.625
That storm manifested

07:37.583 --> 07:41.625
out of a clear blue sky.

07:41.667 --> 07:43.000
Like magic.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.959
No, like science!

07:45.000 --> 07:48.208
Doesn't that blue beam

07:45.000 --> 07:48.208
remind you of something?

07:48.250 --> 07:50.083
The weather machine!

07:50.125 --> 07:54.375
Hmm. It appears ours is still on

07:50.125 --> 07:54.375
the best left forgotten shelf.

07:54.417 --> 07:56.917
Yours? You mean

07:54.417 --> 07:56.917
there are others?

07:56.959 --> 07:59.709
A prototype may have

07:56.959 --> 07:59.709
been created first.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.333
Let's see...

08:04.375 --> 08:06.250
Yes! My records show

08:06.291 --> 08:08.750
that an early version

08:06.291 --> 08:08.750
of the weather machine

08:08.792 --> 08:14.250
should have been

08:08.792 --> 08:14.250
delivered here in 1966.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.000
But it never arrived.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.208
1966?

08:18.250 --> 08:20.834
That's the year great

08:18.250 --> 08:20.834
grandpa's ship was lost.

08:20.875 --> 08:25.208
The last person to have access

08:20.875 --> 08:25.208
to the tech aboard it was--

08:25.250 --> 08:28.041
Doctor Morocco.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.917
Well, this is disappointing.

08:30.959 --> 08:32.959
Apparently a tornado

08:30.959 --> 08:32.959
just isn't enough

08:33.000 --> 08:36.333
to cause an island-wide

08:33.000 --> 08:36.333
evacuation anymore.

08:36.375 --> 08:42.834
It seems I must use something

08:36.375 --> 08:42.834
a bit more...persuasive.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
( thunder crashing )

08:56.166 --> 09:00.041
I do hope

08:56.166 --> 09:00.041
no one's flying a kite.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.583
(  upbeat theme playing  )

09:06.625 --> 09:08.125
You're clear to go ashore.

09:08.166 --> 09:11.291
Just call when you need

09:08.166 --> 09:11.291
a ride back.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.083
Hey, OP!

09:25.125 --> 09:28.041
What is shakin',

09:25.125 --> 09:28.041
bacon?

09:28.083 --> 09:31.458
Sir, my partner insisted

09:28.083 --> 09:31.458
on accompanying me to--

09:31.500 --> 09:35.125
Nothing much,

09:31.500 --> 09:35.125
double dutch.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.750
I, too, have learned

09:35.166 --> 09:37.750
from humans.

09:37.792 --> 09:41.166
I have summoned you here because

09:37.792 --> 09:41.166
you have proven yourself worthy

09:41.208 --> 09:44.166
for the next step

09:41.208 --> 09:44.166
in Rescue Bots leadership.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.041
A third form.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.667
Preparation for

09:46.083 --> 09:48.667
your re-scan will require

09:48.709 --> 09:50.959
tremendous energy

09:48.709 --> 09:50.959
and concentration.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.208
But I am certain you are

09:51.000 --> 09:54.208
prepared for the ordeal.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.834
Thank you, sir.

09:55.875 --> 09:58.083
Um...a little lost here.

09:58.125 --> 10:00.000
What is the ordeal, exactly?

10:00.041 --> 10:03.166
Look, I have two forms, right?

10:00.041 --> 10:03.166
Bot and fire truck.

10:03.208 --> 10:05.250
But now I can scan

10:03.208 --> 10:05.250
a new vehicle

10:05.291 --> 10:07.166
and change into that

10:05.291 --> 10:07.166
as my third mode.

10:07.208 --> 10:10.000
Oh!

10:07.208 --> 10:10.000
Pick something fast.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.417
And convertible.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.417
Hayley would love that.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.875
Or a jet.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.875
We'd fly circles around Dani.

10:14.917 --> 10:16.500
Hey, hey, what about a train?

10:16.542 --> 10:19.542
Gee, why stop there?

10:16.542 --> 10:19.542
What about a space shuttle?

10:19.583 --> 10:22.542
Sometimes you do not

10:19.583 --> 10:22.542
choose the vehicle.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.500
The vehicle chooses you.

10:25.542 --> 10:28.041
And there will be plenty of time

10:25.542 --> 10:28.041
for that later,

10:28.083 --> 10:30.709
once you learn to harness

10:28.083 --> 10:30.709
the energy within.

10:30.750 --> 10:35.458
First, you must reach into your

10:30.750 --> 10:35.458
spark to find inner strength.

10:39.750 --> 10:43.208
If Doctor Morocco truly does

10:39.750 --> 10:43.208
have a weather machine,

10:43.250 --> 10:47.083
I bet you all the powers of ten

10:43.250 --> 10:47.083
in Avogadro's number

10:47.125 --> 10:48.875
that he'll use it again.

10:48.917 --> 10:52.208
Whoa! Sounds like

10:48.917 --> 10:52.208
he already has.

10:55.375 --> 10:57.834
That doesn't look like any

10:55.375 --> 10:57.834
setting on the weather machine.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.917
DOC GREENE:

10:57.875 --> 11:00.917
No doubt Morocco

10:57.875 --> 11:00.917
souped-up the technology.

11:00.959 --> 11:03.542
( thunder crashing )

11:03.583 --> 11:06.208
And not a good soup,

11:03.583 --> 11:06.208
like chicken noodle.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.792
( grunts )

11:09.875 --> 11:11.500
Chase, are you all right?

11:11.542 --> 11:13.083
Yes, sir.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.083
But I do not wish to attempt

11:13.125 --> 11:15.083
such an encounter again.

11:15.125 --> 11:17.417
Perhaps we should

11:15.125 --> 11:17.417
take shelter.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.208
( electricity crackles )

11:22.250 --> 11:25.166
The communications tower.

11:25.208 --> 11:27.208
Coms are out.

11:25.208 --> 11:27.208
Phones must be, too.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.542
Doc, I'm declaring this

11:27.250 --> 11:29.542
a full-scale emergency.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.166
Good thing Boulder

11:29.583 --> 11:31.166
and Graham reinforced

11:31.208 --> 11:32.709
the Sanctuary Caverns.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.500
I already sent Frankie

11:32.750 --> 11:35.500
to the caves with supplies.

11:35.542 --> 11:38.125
And as many board games

11:35.542 --> 11:38.125
as she could carry.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.041
But, Dad, don't we have

11:38.166 --> 11:41.041
to stop Doctor Morocco?

11:41.083 --> 11:43.583
First we have to make sure

11:41.083 --> 11:43.583
everyone's safe, son.

11:43.625 --> 11:46.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:46.083 --> 11:48.417
I still can't reach Dad.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.417
Any luck with Heatwave?

11:48.458 --> 11:49.667
No answer.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.583
But we know

11:49.709 --> 11:51.583
what he would say.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.375
( imitating Heatwave ):

11:51.625 --> 11:53.375
Protect the humans.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.792
Dad would tell us

11:53.417 --> 11:55.792
to follow protocol.

11:55.834 --> 11:57.625
That means getting

11:55.834 --> 11:57.625
everyone we can

11:57.667 --> 12:00.208
to the Sanctuary Caves

11:57.667 --> 12:00.208
under Mt. Griffin.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.542
( yelps )

12:02.583 --> 12:05.166
Heatwave will be sad

12:02.583 --> 12:05.166
he missed this.

12:05.208 --> 12:06.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:06.959 --> 12:08.500
( tires squealing )

12:08.542 --> 12:10.125
Ahh!

12:13.917 --> 12:15.709
Unh!

12:15.750 --> 12:18.375
Take the tunnels to the caves.

12:15.750 --> 12:18.375
Tell everybody you see.

12:18.417 --> 12:21.458
Boulder, over here!

12:21.500 --> 12:23.542
( electricity crackling )

12:23.583 --> 12:25.125
Climb aboard.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.083
( thunder crashes )

12:30.125 --> 12:32.250
( grunts )

12:32.291 --> 12:35.125
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

12:32.291 --> 12:35.125
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

12:40.875 --> 12:45.709
That should be enough to keep

12:40.875 --> 12:45.709
the Burns family busy for days.

12:45.750 --> 12:49.709
Which makes it

12:45.750 --> 12:49.709
a ducky time for a visit.

12:58.959 --> 13:01.875
Whoa! Is he supposed

12:58.959 --> 13:01.875
to do that?

13:01.917 --> 13:06.375
Yes. It is a normal part

13:01.917 --> 13:06.375
of the energy focusing process.

13:06.417 --> 13:09.125
Okay. Because if anything

13:06.417 --> 13:09.125
happens to him...

13:09.166 --> 13:11.417
Your concern

13:09.166 --> 13:11.417
does you justice.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.834
I can see why Heatwave

13:11.458 --> 13:14.834
cherishes your partnership.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.417
He--He said that?

13:17.458 --> 13:19.166
Not in so many words.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.792
( groans )

13:21.834 --> 13:24.041
I feel like Boulder

13:21.834 --> 13:24.041
ran me over.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.667
You're going

13:24.083 --> 13:25.667
to be fine, buddy.

13:25.709 --> 13:29.250
Buddy? Uh...did something

13:25.709 --> 13:29.250
happen while I was out?

13:32.375 --> 13:34.083
Heatwave,

13:34.125 --> 13:37.792
you have successfully focused

13:34.125 --> 13:37.792
your energy for a re-scan.

13:37.834 --> 13:42.166
I am impressed.

13:37.834 --> 13:42.166
Few succeed on their first try.

13:42.208 --> 13:45.083
Thank you, sir. Ohh.

13:45.125 --> 13:49.000
Easy. You will be weak

13:45.125 --> 13:49.000
until you fully recover.

13:49.041 --> 13:51.041
But you may scan

13:49.041 --> 13:51.041
your new vehicle mode

13:51.083 --> 13:53.667
whenever you find the one

13:51.083 --> 13:53.667
that is right.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.250
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:56.291 --> 13:59.291
How neighborly.

13:56.291 --> 13:59.291
An open door.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.583
( device beeping )

14:00.625 --> 14:03.375
No security system?

14:03.417 --> 14:05.375
How trusting.

14:05.417 --> 14:08.709
( device continues beeping )

14:12.000 --> 14:13.917
( platform beeping )

14:17.709 --> 14:19.333
( device beeping )

14:19.375 --> 14:20.709
Hello.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.792
What have we here?

14:24.500 --> 14:26.500
( beeping )

14:27.959 --> 14:31.375
It's delightful

14:27.959 --> 14:31.375
dealing with amateurs.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.834
Incredible!

14:33.875 --> 14:37.667
This technology's even more

14:33.875 --> 14:37.667
advanced than the robots.

14:37.709 --> 14:41.542
But where on Earth

14:37.709 --> 14:41.542
did the Burns family find it?

14:41.583 --> 14:43.834
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

14:48.125 --> 14:50.834
Sigma Seventeen Ship Log,

14:48.125 --> 14:50.834
Rescue Bots reporting.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.083
We are departing Cybertron

14:50.875 --> 14:53.083
on a routine patrol

14:53.125 --> 14:54.375
to the Quintessa Quadrant.

14:54.417 --> 14:58.208
Not on Earth at all.

15:00.208 --> 15:02.166
Oh, Dani!

15:03.875 --> 15:05.333
Where's Graham?

15:05.375 --> 15:08.750
Right behind us

15:05.375 --> 15:08.750
with the Rubios.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.375
Thank goodness.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.375
Now everyone's accounted for.

15:11.417 --> 15:13.208
Nice work, team.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.208
But how'd you know I'd

15:13.250 --> 15:16.208
implement the Sanctuary plan?

15:16.250 --> 15:19.917
Communications were down,

15:16.250 --> 15:19.917
so we just followed procedure.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.250
It looks like we're dealing

15:19.959 --> 15:22.250
with a weather machine.

15:22.291 --> 15:24.083
According to Doc's

15:22.291 --> 15:24.083
calculations,

15:24.125 --> 15:26.208
it's out in the ocean

15:24.125 --> 15:26.208
at these coordinates.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.375
We'll take the Darby Ava.

15:28.417 --> 15:30.333
( thunder crashing )

15:30.375 --> 15:32.375
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:37.333 --> 15:40.875
Careful coming aboard, team.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.875
This isn't swimming weather.

15:40.917 --> 15:45.875
Didn't you hear the forecast?

15:40.917 --> 15:45.875
100 percent chance of fire.

15:45.917 --> 15:49.375
( beeping )

15:52.917 --> 15:54.375
BOULDER:

15:52.917 --> 15:54.375
Look!

15:55.667 --> 15:58.750
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

16:03.166 --> 16:05.166
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

16:07.417 --> 16:09.792
Hurry!

16:07.417 --> 16:09.792
Bucket brigade!

16:16.208 --> 16:18.125
CHIEF:

16:16.208 --> 16:18.125
Quick thinking, Graham.

16:18.166 --> 16:21.542
Something tells me we're going

16:18.166 --> 16:21.542
to have to think a lot quicker.

16:23.542 --> 16:27.000
Oh man. We sure picked the wrong

16:23.542 --> 16:27.000
day to lose our firefighters.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:30.250 --> 16:32.834
Heatwave, does that look

16:30.250 --> 16:32.834
like smoke to you?

16:32.875 --> 16:34.667
Better call Chief

16:32.875 --> 16:34.667
just in case.

16:35.583 --> 16:37.417
Dad's not picking up.

16:37.458 --> 16:41.375
Heatwave to Sigma Seventeen.

16:37.458 --> 16:41.375
Come in, Rescue Bots.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.792
I'll try the ferry's radio.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.166
( grunts )

16:45.208 --> 16:47.667
Captain Shaw?

16:45.208 --> 16:47.667
Is something wrong?

16:47.709 --> 16:51.125
Aye. I can't raise the

16:47.709 --> 16:51.125
harbormaster by phone or radio,

16:51.166 --> 16:54.250
and the dock

16:51.166 --> 16:54.250
is covered in flames.

16:54.291 --> 16:56.000
We have to get back

16:54.291 --> 16:56.000
to the island, now.

16:56.041 --> 16:57.792
Can't this rust bucket

16:56.041 --> 16:57.792
go any faster?

16:57.834 --> 16:59.750
Not in this part of the sea.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.959
A boneyard of shipwrecks

16:59.792 --> 17:01.959
lies below us.

17:02.041 --> 17:05.041
We put on any speed,

17:02.041 --> 17:05.041
we're likely to join 'em.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.125
Ahh. Some leader I am.

17:09.166 --> 17:11.959
Stuck out here when my team

17:09.166 --> 17:11.959
needs me most.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.500
Maybe we can hitchhike

17:12.000 --> 17:14.500
on a faster boat.

17:14.542 --> 17:16.875
There's one!

17:16.917 --> 17:18.959
KADE:

17:16.917 --> 17:18.959
A swamped fireboat?

17:19.000 --> 17:22.083
You're kidding, right? How's it

17:19.000 --> 17:22.083
supposed to help us down there?

17:22.125 --> 17:23.583
It doesn't look damaged.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.792
Besides, sometimes the vehicle

17:23.625 --> 17:26.792
chooses you, remember?

17:26.834 --> 17:31.250
See ya, Captain.

17:26.834 --> 17:31.250
We're catching another ride.

17:31.291 --> 17:33.792
(  dramatic theme playing  )

17:39.667 --> 17:43.166
Something's not right

17:39.667 --> 17:43.166
about those Burns kids.

17:43.208 --> 17:45.208
(  dramatic theme playing  )

17:57.542 --> 17:59.792
( Heatwave grunts )

18:03.375 --> 18:07.625
Ugh! Heatwave! Can't you drive

18:03.375 --> 18:07.625
a straight line?

18:07.667 --> 18:09.542
I'm still getting

18:07.667 --> 18:09.542
the hang of it.

18:09.583 --> 18:12.875
You try changing into a boat

18:09.583 --> 18:12.875
and see how well you do.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.375
( horn blares )

18:12.917 --> 18:15.375
HEATWAVE:  Well, that's the horn.

18:15.417 --> 18:17.875
Let's see what this one does.

18:17.917 --> 18:20.208
( yells ):

18:17.917 --> 18:20.208
No, Daddy!

18:20.250 --> 18:22.250
( siren blaring )

18:34.583 --> 18:37.291
Good job!

18:37.333 --> 18:39.000
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

18:43.625 --> 18:47.166
Boulder, Chase! We can't lose

18:43.625 --> 18:47.166
our only fire truck.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.709
Can you move it to safety?

18:48.750 --> 18:50.583
Blades! Get down here!

18:59.083 --> 19:00.417
( Transformers grunting )

19:02.041 --> 19:04.417
( Blades yelps )

19:07.625 --> 19:09.792
(  triumphant theme playing  )

19:14.166 --> 19:17.875
( all cheering )

19:17.917 --> 19:21.750
Kade! Aw, thanks for the save.

19:17.917 --> 19:21.750
Where'd you get the boat?

19:21.792 --> 19:25.000
HEATWAVE:

19:21.792 --> 19:25.000
The boat has a name.

19:21.792 --> 19:25.000
And you're welcome.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.917
Heatwave?

19:25.041 --> 19:26.917
How is it possible?

19:26.959 --> 19:28.583
I'm clearly missing

19:26.959 --> 19:28.583
something here.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.375
Heatwave, we owe you one.

19:30.417 --> 19:33.625
But now you need to go shut off

19:30.417 --> 19:33.625
the machine causing this.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.583
It's just east

19:33.667 --> 19:35.583
of the 49th buoy.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.917
HEATWAVE:

19:35.625 --> 19:37.917
On my way.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.333
Oh, come on!

19:37.959 --> 19:40.333
Whoa!

19:40.375 --> 19:44.208
HEATWAVE:

19:40.375 --> 19:44.208
Sorry! Still getting

19:40.375 --> 19:44.208
the hang of this.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:00.750 --> 20:02.500
Ugh!

20:07.333 --> 20:09.333
(  triumphant theme playing  )

20:13.208 --> 20:16.208
HEATWAVE:

20:13.208 --> 20:16.208
Ha! I like this new form.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.000
What do you think, Kade?

20:18.041 --> 20:21.875
I think...

20:18.041 --> 20:21.875
I'm getting sea sick.

20:23.417 --> 20:27.959
So how exactly does

20:23.417 --> 20:27.959
re-scanning work?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.333
I mean, say hypothetically,

20:29.375 --> 20:31.417
a Bot didn't want

20:29.375 --> 20:31.417
to fly anymore.

20:31.458 --> 20:34.500
It's not easy. I had to get

20:31.458 --> 20:34.500
Optimus' permission first.

20:34.542 --> 20:37.542
And I'm still exhausted,

20:34.542 --> 20:37.542
even with his help.

20:37.583 --> 20:38.959
Sorry, Blades.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.417
What made you think

20:39.000 --> 20:42.417
I was talking about me?

20:44.834 --> 20:46.208
DANI:

20:44.834 --> 20:46.208
Dad? What's wrong?

20:46.250 --> 20:48.125
The framing shop

20:46.250 --> 20:48.125
found something strange

20:48.166 --> 20:50.083
while they were restoring

20:48.166 --> 20:50.083
grandpa's picture.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.333
A camera was hidden inside.

20:52.375 --> 20:55.083
Whoa. Morocco

20:52.375 --> 20:55.083
was spying on us?

20:55.125 --> 20:56.709
How much

20:55.125 --> 20:56.709
do you think he saw?

20:56.750 --> 20:58.458
CHASE:

20:56.750 --> 20:58.458
That is not our only concern.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.917
The rogue was

20:58.500 --> 21:00.917
in our classified bunker.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.417
I have not yet cataloged

21:00.959 --> 21:03.417
all that is missing,

21:03.458 --> 21:05.417
but it is certain

21:03.458 --> 21:05.417
that things were stolen.

21:05.458 --> 21:08.792
The weather disasters must have

21:05.458 --> 21:08.792
been a plan to keep us busy.

21:08.834 --> 21:12.458
So if Doctor Morocco

21:08.834 --> 21:12.458
knows our secret,

21:12.500 --> 21:14.792
what's his next move?

21:14.834 --> 21:19.500
MOROCCO:

21:14.834 --> 21:19.500
I will no longer be focusing

21:14.834 --> 21:19.500
on upgrading my MorBots.

21:19.542 --> 21:21.125
However...

21:21.166 --> 21:24.375
I now have access

21:21.166 --> 21:24.375
to the most advanced technology

21:24.417 --> 21:26.375
the world has ever seen.

21:26.417 --> 21:31.083
And it can be yours. Heh.

21:26.417 --> 21:31.083
For an appropriate fee.
