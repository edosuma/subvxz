00:01.201 --> 00:03.269
{\an8}Last season on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:03.336 --> 00:05.739
{\an8}You're gonna see
little man today.

00:05.805 --> 00:08.908
{\an7}You can either live with me
or live without me.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.411
{\an7}He don't give a (bleep).
I told you from the beginning.

00:11.478 --> 00:14.080
{\an7}I still needed you
to be a friend.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.683
{\an8}You can't rap. You don't
know (bleep) about music.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.519
{\an8}That's why the (bleep)
I can't be with your ass.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.519
{\an5}And that's fine.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.221
{\an7}I just want to make sure
you're ready

00:21.287 --> 00:24.124
{\an7}to actually be a man
and have a family.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.658
{\an8}(cheering)

00:25.725 --> 00:28.762
{\an8}'Cause I thought you
had seen some photos.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.130
{\an8}I haven't seen anything.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.332
{\an8}It's gonna be media,
propaganda.

00:32.399 --> 00:33.967
{\an7}I don't want you
to touch me right now.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.635
{\an8}We just really need to talk.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.170
{\an8}All right, whatever, then.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.371
{\an8}You are having a baby.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.673
{\an7}You could have stopped
for a second.

00:40.740 --> 00:41.875
{\an8}You're still thinking right now
he's your man?

00:41.941 --> 00:44.277
{\an8}Calm (bleep) down, bitch!

00:41.941 --> 00:44.277
{\an9}Bitch!

00:44.344 --> 00:46.513
{\an8}Why are you so mad,
that I look so good?

00:46.579 --> 00:48.515
{\an8}We need to make a toast
to our first date.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.850
{\an8}To new beginnings.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.850
{\an8}Yeah, to new beginnings.

00:50.917 --> 00:52.986
{\an8}Respect me
as Cameron's mother

00:53.052 --> 00:55.422
{\an8}and understand that
we are banded for life

00:55.488 --> 00:57.891
{\an7}until one of the three of us
is six feet under.

00:57.957 --> 01:00.393
{\an8}I don't want to hear
about you in your new spot

01:00.460 --> 01:01.694
{\an8}with your new bitch.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.930
{\an8}That was in the bag?

01:01.761 --> 01:03.930
{\an7}Bitch!

01:03.997 --> 01:06.733
{\an8}I'm trying to figure out
why am I picking you up

01:06.800 --> 01:07.967
{\an8}from the police station?

01:08.034 --> 01:11.504
{\an7}No more going to jail,
no more grabbing body parts.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.541
{\an8}It's like with this Teairra
girl, she just won't let go.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.643
{\an8}You're a bitch.
You're a bitch.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.643
{\an5}You know what?

01:16.709 --> 01:19.012
{\an8}Stop. Stop.

01:19.078 --> 01:20.413
{\an8}Aw (bleep).

01:20.480 --> 01:22.649
{\an8}I'm gonna (bleep)
him up right now.

01:22.715 --> 01:24.851
{\an7}I love you.
I haven't stopped loving you.

Cheers to you.

02:25.745 --> 02:26.980
{\an3}Megaa man.

02:27.046 --> 02:28.414
Yes.

02:28.481 --> 02:31.150
{\an8}After a year filled
of Ray J issues,

02:31.217 --> 02:34.621
{\an8}your girl T.T. is happy to be
turning the page on the drama.

02:34.687 --> 02:37.323
I'm focusing more on myself
and my happiness.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.359
And nothing gets
the spirit lifted more

02:39.425 --> 02:41.661
than hanging out with my girls
Apryl and Moniece.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.997
Moniece sittin' here
real quiet all day.

02:44.063 --> 02:46.165
{\an1}I'm gonna need to know 'cause
you acting real uppity.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.767
What's going on?
'Cause I know you and Drew

02:47.834 --> 02:49.068
ain't messing with
each other, so we're--

02:49.135 --> 02:50.803
What's going on?
Who you messing with?

02:50.870 --> 02:52.472
What's going on with you.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.040
{\an5}I'm seeing someone.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.040
{\an3}Ooh.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.643
And he shall remain nameless
for the moment.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.578
{\an6}Okay.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.578
He comes in town this week.

02:58.645 --> 03:01.147
And I'm just mentally preparing
'cause I just want to make sure

03:01.214 --> 03:02.882
that I do what I have to do
to make sure

03:02.949 --> 03:04.918
{\an5}he never wants to leave.

03:02.949 --> 03:04.918
{\an3}Yeah.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.486
So I'm trying to get back
into the relationship.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.288
{\an5}You wanna
take your time, yes.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.288
{\an1}Moniece.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.857
{\an5}Yeah, because I haven't
been in a relationship
in a long time.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.226
Like, no, like, just--
I'm in love.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.894
{\an5}Well, I'm happy for you, baby.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.894
Thank you.

03:14.961 --> 03:18.531
So what's up with--
I mean, so you're done with Ray?

03:18.598 --> 03:20.733
{\an5}Oh, absolutely.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.733
You're in a clear head space.
You're happy.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.735
Okay, well, good,
'cause then I need to know,

03:22.802 --> 03:24.737
since I'm nosy Rosie,
petty Betty,

03:24.804 --> 03:27.607
what he (bleep) is up
with Princess the (bleep)

03:27.674 --> 03:29.676
rip-cracking warrior

03:29.742 --> 03:31.978
getting arrested in
(bleep) New Orleans?

03:32.045 --> 03:34.647
Is the bitch a (bleep)
barbarian or what?

03:34.714 --> 03:37.317
{\an8}So word around town is
that Princess and Ray

03:37.383 --> 03:40.153
{\an8}got into this major fight
in a hotel in New Orleans

03:40.219 --> 03:43.356
and landed herself
a spot up under the jail.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.992
And I always felt like the bitch
might be a little psycho,

03:46.059 --> 03:47.727
but I can't say
that I'm shocked, either.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.063
{\an1}I wouldn't know, I read
the same things in the news.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.965
{\an1}I don't know,
but what I did say,

03:52.031 --> 03:53.833
it was like karma
is a bitch

03:53.900 --> 03:55.969
because you sat there
all last year

03:56.035 --> 03:58.504
{\an1}and went around town
telling everybody

03:58.571 --> 04:00.640
that I was beating
your ass and violent

04:00.707 --> 04:03.209
and abusive towards you
and now look.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.812
{\an5}But obviously, that makes
you look less crazy.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.812
{\an1}I know.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.480
(shrieking)

04:07.547 --> 04:09.415
You ain't no crazy bitch!

04:09.482 --> 04:11.250
Hey! Nae Nae!

04:11.317 --> 04:13.186
Okay, I can't Nae Nae.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.655
So I just want to tell
all of you beautiful women

04:15.722 --> 04:17.724
{\an1}that I'm about to do a pamper
party that I feel like,

04:17.790 --> 04:19.625
you know, we need.

04:19.692 --> 04:22.395
We need to let go of
some stress and release.

04:22.462 --> 04:26.132
{\an1}So, T, I've had my own personal
conversations with Princess,

04:26.199 --> 04:29.369
and like, I did
invite her to be there.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.905
{\an8}Before I got pregnant, I was hot
and I was popping hanging out

04:32.972 --> 04:34.941
{\an8}in these Hollywood streets
with my girls.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.577
So now that Megaa
is a bit bigger now,

04:37.644 --> 04:39.379
I'm ready to get back
to my old self.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.414
So I've been hanging out
with some of my day ones

04:41.481 --> 04:44.050
and a few new friends,
one being Princess.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.585
We became friendly
last year

04:45.652 --> 04:47.620
and now sometimes we hang
in the same circles.

04:47.687 --> 04:51.557
{\an1}I am just letting you know as my
friend that that's what I did.

04:51.624 --> 04:55.061
{\an4}Okay, so let me let you know
something as my friend.

04:51.624 --> 04:55.061
{\an3}Okay.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.797
You tell that bitch to stay in
her lane and I'll stay in mine.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.266
{\an5}Ooh, barracuda!

04:57.864 --> 05:00.266
But you're bigger
than-- than that.

05:00.333 --> 05:03.436
{\an1}No, I said tell her to stay in
hers and I'm gonna stay in mine.

05:03.503 --> 05:06.072
{\an5}(Teairra)
I love Apryl and I can't wait
to go to her party,

05:06.139 --> 05:07.940
but being in
the same room as Princess

05:08.007 --> 05:10.043
is not what I call
a relaxing day.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.779
The last time me and this bitch
were in a room together,

05:12.845 --> 05:16.382
it ended ugly, and I'm not
looking forward to a repeat.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.385
I'll be there for you
and that's what it is.

{\an5}(Hazel-E)
So it's been a crazy year
for Hazel-E.

05:44.977 --> 05:47.880
But hey, I'm back to doing
what I do best--

05:47.947 --> 05:50.283
{\an8}making music
and looking good as hell.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.185
{\an8}Last year,
I went through hell

05:52.251 --> 05:54.487
{\an8}with Lil' Berg,
Mansika,

05:54.554 --> 05:56.255
{\an8}and hell, even Teairra.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.257
But now it's all about me,

05:58.324 --> 06:00.393
Miss Hazel-E, baby.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.396
So I just got back
from my grandpa's funeral,

06:03.463 --> 06:05.998
and I'm not gonna lie,
I've been a mess.

06:06.065 --> 06:08.568
But it's made me realize
life is too short

06:08.634 --> 06:10.436
to dwell on petty
bull(bleep).

06:10.503 --> 06:11.971
It's time to focus

06:12.038 --> 06:15.475
and get Hazel-E back
to where she needs to be.

What's up, baby?

06:22.181 --> 06:25.284
Milan and I go back.
I mean, way back.

06:25.351 --> 06:27.787
He's a hot producer,
a model, an actor,

06:27.854 --> 06:30.389
and he's worked with tons
of artists all over L.A.

06:30.456 --> 06:32.425
Hell, the whole entire world.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.460
In addition to that,
he's also a sweetheart.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.562
And when he heard
about my grandpa passing,

06:36.629 --> 06:39.265
he was one of the first people
to actually reach out to me

06:39.332 --> 06:41.100
just to see how I was doing.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.569
{\an7}I know you going through
a lot right now, so...

06:41.167 --> 06:43.569
{\an6}Yeah.

06:43.636 --> 06:46.339
{\an8}Just getting back from
Houston, you know, um...

06:46.405 --> 06:48.841
{\an8}Hey. What's up, beautiful,
how are you?

06:48.908 --> 06:50.710
{\an8}How are you?

06:48.908 --> 06:50.710
{\an8}I'm good.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.845
{\an8}You're looking sexy.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.845
{\an8}No, you looking good.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.715
{\an5}How you been?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.715
I'm surviving out here.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.283
{\an5}Surviving out here
in these streets?

06:55.782 --> 06:57.283
{\an3}Yeah.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.352
{\an5}Gimme five.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.352
All right.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.888
So how you taking it?
How you handling that?

07:01.954 --> 07:03.823
You know, it's hard, but I'm--
I mean, I'm at peace with it.

07:03.890 --> 07:07.293
I got to talk to him
before he passed.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.028
And interesting,

07:09.095 --> 07:11.631
Teairra
reached out to me.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.300
{\an5}Teairra Mari?

07:11.697 --> 07:14.300
Yes, Teairra Mari.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.203
{\an5}What she reach out about?

07:14.367 --> 07:17.203
I mean, I had posted
on Instagram

07:17.270 --> 07:19.872
{\an4}about my grandfather passing,
like, it's a real sensitive
situation.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.908
She actually
met my grandparents,

07:21.974 --> 07:24.677
so I still think it was
kind of big of her,

07:24.744 --> 07:28.181
{\an1}like, at least to me,
I still know she got a heart.

07:28.247 --> 07:29.849
I care for Teairra Mari,

07:29.916 --> 07:31.684
but (bleep) got
out of hand last year.

07:31.751 --> 07:34.320
After rumors flew
that she "allegedly"

07:34.387 --> 07:36.522
got down on her knees
for Berg,

07:36.589 --> 07:38.057
I was pissed.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.792
But at least
she's making baby steps

07:39.859 --> 07:41.394
to repair our relationship.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.196
I'm gonna,
for my sanity,

07:43.262 --> 07:46.566
{\an5}think that
she's being sincere.

07:43.262 --> 07:46.566
{\an1}Genuine.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.268
{\an5}So we'll see where
it goes, you know?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.268
{\an1}Right.

07:49.335 --> 07:52.271
So what's up with bae?

07:52.338 --> 07:55.541
{\an1}Ain't nothing
really up with bae.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.243
{\an1}Like, I don't even
know what's going on.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.245
{\an1}Like, you know, I'm, like,
full-fledged in love.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.748
{\an1}Like, I'm ready to get married,
I'm ready to have kids.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.284
{\an5}Married, kids?

08:02.815 --> 08:05.284
Married, I'm ready to have kids.

08:05.351 --> 08:08.354
{\an1}So it's like, I need
to know where we're at.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.690
{\an4}Because at this point,
it's like, if we ain't
on the same page,

08:10.756 --> 08:12.124
{\an1}then we need to
just call it.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.693
Yeah, kick rocks, like,
you know what I'm saying?

08:13.759 --> 08:15.261
{\an1}Bust a move, you know what
I'm saying, on to the next one.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.063
{\an5}(Milan)
I've been in a relationship
for a while now

08:17.129 --> 08:18.798
and I think it's time
we take it to the next level.

08:18.865 --> 08:21.000
I'm crazy in love
and I'm ready to settle down

08:21.067 --> 08:22.535
and take myself
off the market.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.303
So we need to have this
conversation sooner than later

08:24.370 --> 08:26.472
before I waste
any more of my time.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.507
{\an1}Listen, I'm gonna
talk to bae.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.142
{\an1}I wouldn't (bleep)
with Teairra,

08:30.209 --> 08:32.311
{\an1}but if you want to (bleep)
with Teairra, go ahead.

08:32.378 --> 08:33.880
You fly, you bomb.

08:33.946 --> 08:36.782
{\an5}It's not that I want to.

08:33.946 --> 08:36.782
You know, I love you.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.452
{\an1}So I'm gonna get back
to this money.

08:39.518 --> 08:42.255
{\an1}Send Miles ass back in here
when you step out.

08:42.321 --> 08:43.722
{\an1}All right?

08:43.789 --> 08:45.258
{\an1}I'm gonna hit you up, I'm gonna
send you some tracks, too.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.559
Please do.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.395
Miles, boss need you
in studio one.

{\an5}(Ray J)
Your boy Ray J is back
and business is poppin'.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.707
I got new music coming out,
money is good,

09:01.774 --> 09:03.376
and projects are great.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.778
But you know what? My personal
life is kind of a mess.

09:05.845 --> 09:08.614
{\an8}I just went to New Orleans,
brought my girlfriend Princess

09:08.681 --> 09:12.952
{\an8}with me on a business trip
and that was a total disaster.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.288
{\an5}(Princess)
I'm so done with Ray
at this point.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.456
Like, I caught him trying
to hook up with strippers

09:17.523 --> 09:19.292
in our hotel room
in New Orleans.

09:19.358 --> 09:22.461
{\an8}And when I confronted him about
it, we got into a huge fight.

09:22.528 --> 09:25.598
{\an8}And when the police came,
I'm the one that went to jail.

09:27.466 --> 09:29.835
{\an5}(Ray J)
I'm on probation.
She ain't on probation.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.538
So she took the rap
and I appreciate her for that,

09:32.605 --> 09:34.473
but we was both turnt up.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.943
(Princess)
Then, when I'm locked up,

09:37.009 --> 09:39.011
Ray goes and gives
a false story to TMZ

09:39.078 --> 09:41.247
saying that I broke his ribs
and tore his ACL.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.250
And people are really believing
that I did this to him.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.019
{\an5}(Ray J)
When we got back to L.A.,
Princess left the house.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.755
I said some things to her
that I shouldn't. I was wrong.

09:49.822 --> 09:51.857
She got every right
to feel like she feel.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.093
And now I'm tripping
because I miss my girl.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.495
She hiding out at her friend's
house in some condo

09:56.562 --> 09:59.465
and I want her to come home.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.767
(knocking on door)

10:03.336 --> 10:05.271
{\an8}Princess.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.808
We need to talk.

10:08.874 --> 10:11.110
{\an5}(Princess)
Now, Ray is not the one
to apologize,

10:11.177 --> 10:13.412
but he has been begging
to come see me.

10:13.479 --> 10:16.115
And I'm confused because
I want to make things work,

10:16.182 --> 10:19.452
{\an5}but I'm not about to
put up with this bull(bleep)
he keeps pulling.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.721
Okay, let's-- let's talk
about New Orleans, okay?

10:21.787 --> 10:24.056
So when you go
out of town,

10:24.123 --> 10:27.360
{\an1}is it normal for you to invite
strippers to your room?

10:30.463 --> 10:33.299
{\an1}Why you--
What are you talking about?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.668
{\an5}I'm talking about you--

10:33.366 --> 10:35.668
{\an1}You don't know
what you talking about.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.536
{\an5}We went to--

10:35.735 --> 10:37.536
I know exactly what
I'm talking about.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.638
{\an5}Okay, this is what happened.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.638
No, we don't have to
reiterate what happened

10:39.705 --> 10:42.108
{\an5}because I know
what happened.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.108
No, this is what happened.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.543
{\an1}We went to New Orleans,
I was supposed to bring you back

10:44.610 --> 10:47.380
{\an1}your soul food, and I got
caught up at the strip club.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.548
{\an5}Okay, and then
you got another room.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.548
{\an1}No.

10:49.615 --> 10:51.017
And you invited them
to your room.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.687
{\an1}No, I got another room, you
found me, you found my floor--

10:54.754 --> 10:56.355
And I found your phone
with the strippers saying

10:56.422 --> 10:57.823
that they was gonna
come to the room.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.925
{\an1}And, baby, we got loud,
the police came...

10:59.992 --> 11:01.961
{\an5}Okay, but I'm not
talking about that.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.961
I know. Hold on let me finish.

11:02.028 --> 11:03.829
{\an5}I'm talking about why you're--

11:02.028 --> 11:03.829
Hold on, let me finish.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.765
No. No, because
I know what happened.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.066
I ended up going to jail.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.802
You're disrespectful,
you're a cheater,

11:09.869 --> 11:12.405
and you won't let me
know who you are.

11:12.471 --> 11:14.106
I am the person that
loves Princess Love.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.841
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.376
{\an5}You wanna know who I am?

11:15.908 --> 11:17.376
Because the person
that I think you are,

11:17.443 --> 11:18.611
you're not acting like that.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.979
When you go out of town
and you cheat

11:20.046 --> 11:21.847
and invite girls to
your room, that's not you.

11:21.914 --> 11:24.183
But if it is you,
let me know.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.318
You didn't get with a square.

11:26.385 --> 11:29.688
{\an5}(Princess)
I thought that Ray was gonna
give up his turnt-up lifestyle

11:29.755 --> 11:31.524
because he said
he wanted to be with me,

11:31.590 --> 11:33.092
but obviously,
I was wrong.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.794
I deserve a man
who's gonna treat me

11:34.860 --> 11:36.228
with nothing but respect.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.963
And although
I love Ray to death,

11:38.030 --> 11:40.733
I can't be with him anymore
if he's never gonna change.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.868
I see why I'm here.

11:42.935 --> 11:45.271
And I see I'm gonna be
here for a while.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.873
{\an1}I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.775
Go back home.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.844
I'm not doing that
no more.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.879
{\an1}Why you doing me
like that?

11:53.946 --> 11:56.515
'Cause I'm not
doing it no more.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.150
{\an3}(crying)

11:58.217 --> 12:00.786
I need you
to be serious and--

12:00.853 --> 12:03.556
I need you to be
serious with me

12:03.622 --> 12:05.825
and stop playing around.

12:05.891 --> 12:09.862
{\an1}And then all you gotta do is
just forgive me one more time.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.431
I'm not coming back home.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.337
{\an8}What do I got to do
to bring you back home?

12:18.404 --> 12:20.973
{\an7}First, you can start off by
getting rid of your apartment.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.476

I'm done.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.147
I'm gonna need that 'cause I've

14:42.214 --> 14:44.216
{\an5}You are sexy back.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.216

14:44.283 --> 14:46.986
{\an5}you ain't pop no child
out your cooch, okay?

{\an3}Okay.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.725
{\an8}But you know what?
Our sex life, like,

14:52.791 --> 14:55.427
{\an7}it's almost, in a sense, like,
kinda suffering, you know?

14:55.494 --> 14:57.363
{\an1}Because--
And you know me.

14:57.429 --> 15:00.499

15:00.566 --> 15:03.102
{\an1}Yes!

15:03.168 --> 15:05.037
{\an1}Because we don't got no time.
And it's not like we even--

15:05.104 --> 15:06.805
But if you travel together.

15:06.872 --> 15:08.707
{\an1}But we have Megaa,
so it's like, he'll stay up

15:08.774 --> 15:10.309
{\an1}until his parents
go to sleep.

15:10.376 --> 15:11.543
And I'm not doing it
in front of my son.

15:11.610 --> 15:12.945
No, no,
it's uncomfortable.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.581
{\an1}Like, I'm loud.
I like to be like, uhh, yeah.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.016
See what I'm saying?

15:17.082 --> 15:18.350
{\an1}I can't be like that
in front of my--

15:18.417 --> 15:20.352
{\an4}'Cause if I do that,
I'm gonna wake him up.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.352
{\an3}Yes.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.821
{\an5}And then he gonna
be like, what--

15:20.419 --> 15:22.821
He gonna be like--

15:22.888 --> 15:25.357
Ooh, what's Mommy doing?

15:25.424 --> 15:27.059
Girl, Mommy nasty.

15:27.126 --> 15:28.494
{\an5}And I can't have that.

15:27.126 --> 15:28.494
Mommy freaky.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.895
{\an5}So look.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.895
{\an1}Okay.

15:29.962 --> 15:33.799
{\an5}Maybe if it can't
come home to you...

15:29.962 --> 15:33.799
{\an1}Okay.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.568
{\an5}...you can go to
your man at work.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.568
You know what, though?

15:36.635 --> 15:38.337
{\an6}Why not?

15:36.635 --> 15:38.337
{\an1}You know what,
let me ask you something.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.039
{\an1}I know, because I've been
thinking about that.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.507
I've been like,
you know what?

15:41.573 --> 15:44.543
{\an4}I need to pop up on his ass.
Real quick.

15:41.573 --> 15:44.543
{\an3}Go pop up.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.278
{\an5}Drop it like...

15:44.610 --> 15:46.278
Do a pop-up.

15:46.345 --> 15:48.981
{\an1}Get my cootie off
real quick.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.683
Girl, what else
you supposed to do?

15:50.749 --> 15:52.451
{\an1}If you have the baby at home,
it's the only solution.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.053
Mama got needs, okay?

15:54.119 --> 15:57.156
So if that means that I have
to go and pop up on Omari's ass,

15:57.222 --> 15:58.524
well, guess what
I'm gonna have to do.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.726
It's about time I get me
some of that good thing.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.994
{\an1}But you know what?
You right.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.228
{\an5}Yes, you need to.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.228
I do need to take charge.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.097
Okay, look. Whenever you
feel like doing this,

16:05.164 --> 16:06.865
I'm gonna give you
some Nikki's lingerie

16:06.932 --> 16:09.368
and you might get pregnant
with baby number two.

16:09.435 --> 16:11.303
{\an6}Okay?

16:09.435 --> 16:11.303
Girl, you a nasty ho.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.838

16:32.358 --> 16:34.560
My mystery man and I met
about seven months ago

16:34.626 --> 16:36.195
while I was on the road
doing a hosting.

16:36.261 --> 16:38.530
So far, we've been able
to make it work long distance,

16:38.597 --> 16:41.867
but every day,
my affections grow fonder,

16:41.934 --> 16:44.570
my vagina grows hotter,

16:44.636 --> 16:47.306

17:12.598 --> 17:14.665
So I'm just at a place
in my life where I feel like

17:14.733 --> 17:16.635
it's time for me to
reboot my music career

17:16.702 --> 17:18.604
and I'm ready to build
a future with someone.

17:18.670 --> 17:22.074
And Richie D.
happens to be very smart,

17:22.141 --> 17:25.176
he's actually
a really good listener,

17:25.243 --> 17:27.945
and I like his "sausheese."

17:28.012 --> 17:30.983
{\an5}Slaughter!

{\an3}Richie D.

17:31.049 --> 17:33.152
{\an5}What up, Mo-Mo?

17:31.049 --> 17:33.152
You're here.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.421
{\an4}I'm here.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.421
I can't believe
you finally made it.

17:35.487 --> 17:37.189
As I told you I would be.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.558
{\an1}Yo, you got grills?
Let me see.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.528
{\an5}What are those?

17:39.625 --> 17:42.528
Baby, 'cause I'm a thug.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.396
{\an5}No, you not, yo.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.396
Yes, I am.

17:44.463 --> 17:45.664
Gimme a kiss.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.100
{\an1}I told you I was coming.
I'm here.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.035
{\an5}Love you.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.035
I love you, too.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.804
{\an5}(Rich)
I didn't see this coming.
When I met Moniece,

17:51.870 --> 17:53.338
{\an8}I fell in love with
her sense of humor

17:53.405 --> 17:55.441
{\an8}and I kinda knew she was
gonna be around for a while.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.075
{\an8}I'm at the point that
I want something real

17:57.142 --> 17:58.377
{\an8}and I think that this
could be it.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.646
I mean, I'm almost
an old man now,

18:00.712 --> 18:02.214
so I'm growing up, finally.

18:02.281 --> 18:04.650
{\an5}I can't believe you came.

18:02.281 --> 18:04.650
I'm here for a minute.

18:04.716 --> 18:07.219
Where are you staying?
By me? Yes, good.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.921
{\an6}Let's go.

18:07.286 --> 18:08.921
You have to figure it out.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.956

Look at the...

18:11.023 --> 18:12.758
{\an3}Oh, my God.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.359
Meet Dollaz.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.061
{\an5}It's our first baby.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.061
He's not ready, he's not ready.

18:16.128 --> 18:19.198
It's our first baby.
Ooh!

18:19.264 --> 18:20.866
{\an1}Girl, you better
get in this goddamn van.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.768
(Rich)
I've been around, believe me,

18:22.835 --> 18:24.403
but I've never met a girl
like Moniece.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.473
She's smart as a whip and she
gets me like nobody ever has.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.274
I just can't get enough
of this girl.

18:29.341 --> 18:32.010
{\an1}You're here and I can't wait
to spend time with you.

18:32.077 --> 18:34.112
And tonight is
date night, FYI.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.448

18:34.179 --> 18:36.448

18:36.515 --> 18:37.683
{\an3}Sex.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.918
{\an1}That's what I was saying,
homegirl.

18:39.985 --> 18:41.687
I want to do it with
my grill in my mouth.

18:41.753 --> 18:44.656
{\an6}(growls)

18:41.753 --> 18:44.656
No sex with the grill.

18:44.723 --> 18:47.326
{\an1}Yo, you really got a grill in.
Girl, you're insane.

18:47.392 --> 18:49.661
{\an3}Let's go.
(giggles)

18:49.728 --> 18:53.565
{\an5}It's gonna be a long week.

18:49.728 --> 18:53.565
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

{\an8}(Ray J)
Listen, I know I (bleep)
up with Princess

19:03.208 --> 19:05.110
{\an8}and I can't control
my temper sometimes.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.980
{\an8}And I can admit, I'm addicted
to the turnt-up Ray J,

19:08.046 --> 19:10.415
{\an8}but I begged her to trust me
this one last time

19:10.482 --> 19:12.584
{\an8}and meet me on the yacht
so at least was can talk

19:12.651 --> 19:14.520
{\an8}and I can at least
try to win her heart back

19:14.586 --> 19:17.022
{\an8}and try to get my girl
to come back to me.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.292
{\an5}Ray.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.292
Hey.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.194
Thank you
for coming, baby.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.862
Listen, I know
I've been (bleep) up.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.163
I want to make it
right, though.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.932
Come on the boat,
can you?

19:26.999 --> 19:29.468
{\an5}(Princess)
I'm still furious at Ray,
even though he apologized

19:29.535 --> 19:31.169
about what happened
in New Orleans.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.005
But I still love him,

19:33.071 --> 19:36.008
{\an8}so I'm gonna give him one last
chance to make things right.

19:36.074 --> 19:39.945
And unless he's willing to
make some changes, I'm done.

19:41.747 --> 19:43.382
Now, look, I know
I've been tripping, baby.

19:43.448 --> 19:47.286
{\an1}Like, it's just that sometimes,
just living this life,

19:47.352 --> 19:49.788
I get lost in
all kind of (bleep)

19:49.855 --> 19:51.456
and you know what I mean?

19:51.523 --> 19:53.926
I don't-- I don't want
to make you feel bad.

19:53.992 --> 19:55.527
{\an1}You do make me
feel bad, though.

19:55.594 --> 20:00.332
{\an1}Because something in you
changes once every two weeks.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.568
This is the thing.
It's an addiction.

20:02.634 --> 20:05.671
So for me, I'm trying to
fight this addiction

20:05.737 --> 20:08.173
to where,
when I go perform,

20:08.240 --> 20:11.577
{\an1}then there's this after-party,
I'm addicted to the after-party.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.011
I'm starting to feel like

20:13.078 --> 20:14.513
{\an1}you just like doing it
behind my back.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.814
No, this the thing.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.916
I'm trying to get rid
of the after-party.

20:17.983 --> 20:20.118
{\an1}But you shouldn't have to try.
You just do it.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.588
{\an6}It's hard.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.588
{\an1}So maybe you just need
to be single.

20:22.654 --> 20:25.490
{\an1}Look me in my eye. I'm done,
I'm done with that life.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.093
{\an5}I really want to trust you.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.093
I want you to trust me.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.462
{\an1}I don't want to know that
you're full of (bleep).

20:30.529 --> 20:33.498
I'm full of a lot of things,
but I'm not full of (bleep).

20:33.565 --> 20:35.901
And the way I feel
about you is not that

20:35.968 --> 20:37.536
and I want you
to come home.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.638
I want you
to come back home.

20:39.705 --> 20:40.973
{\an3}I miss you.

20:41.039 --> 20:42.808
What do I got to do
to bring you back home?

20:42.874 --> 20:46.244
{\an1}First, you can start off by
getting rid of your apartment.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.680
Because it's not fair to me

20:48.747 --> 20:50.849
{\an1}for you to have
this separate life.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.753
Ray's apartment, his A-P-T,
is more like a bachelor pad.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.421
He said he's using it
for business,

20:56.488 --> 20:59.424
but I think I have a pretty good
idea what goes on there.

20:59.491 --> 21:02.027
So if he expects for me to move
back in his house with him,

21:02.094 --> 21:03.795
then he needs to get rid
of this apartment.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.365
{\an1}Why is it so important for you
to have this apartment?

21:06.431 --> 21:08.133
Before we got together,
you know what I'm saying,

21:08.200 --> 21:09.835
we used to have
a lot of parties,

21:09.901 --> 21:11.069
I used to (bleep)
a lot of (bleep).

21:11.136 --> 21:13.171
And I know that you hate
to hear that, but--

21:13.238 --> 21:15.007
{\an1}But that-- what you're saying
right now is, like...

21:15.073 --> 21:16.441
{\an1}No, no, no, let me just finish,
let me just finish.

21:16.508 --> 21:18.677
I just feel like
now is the time

21:18.744 --> 21:21.813
for me to step up to the plate
and show you that I love you.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.083
{\an5}I love you to death,
I (bleep) love you,
I want to be with you.

21:25.150 --> 21:28.253
(Bleep) that apartment.
I'm done.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.422
If that's gonna be
the step to say,

21:30.489 --> 21:32.958
hey, Ray J really (bleep)
with me, he loves me,

21:33.025 --> 21:34.993
he's making a notion,
he's making steps,

21:35.060 --> 21:37.729
{\an1}he's making moves to show me,
(bleep) that apartment.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.464
I'm done.

21:39.531 --> 21:41.400
I never actually thought
that Ray would agree

21:41.466 --> 21:43.669
to giving up the apartment
after I suggested it.

21:43.735 --> 21:46.872
But I guess he's actually
willing to give it a try.

21:46.938 --> 21:48.573
This actually
changes things for me.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.475
Please come home with me,
I miss you.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.477
Yeah?

21:59.351 --> 22:01.853
{\an5}I missed you.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.853
I missed you, too.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.991
{\an7}So obviously, you know,
Princess here,

22:06.058 --> 22:07.492
{\an8}I hope y'all can get along.

22:07.559 --> 22:09.361
{\an7}Well, it's nothing to get
along about, you know.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.930

I gotta forewarn you.

You know I've been like,
really, like, hard on you

23:46.124 --> 23:48.326
and I feel really bad
because you've been gone.

23:48.393 --> 23:51.730
And I'm in a relationship,
it takes two to tango.

23:51.797 --> 23:53.932
So I really feel like
I should put forth

23:53.999 --> 23:55.867
as much effort

My name is Miles, AKA Sir Brock.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.687
{\an8}I'm a rapper based right here
in the heart of L.A.

25:22.754 --> 25:24.489
Amber and I was
high school sweethearts

25:24.556 --> 25:26.424
and we dated on and off
for about 13 years.

25:26.491 --> 25:27.993
Even though we not
together right now,

25:28.059 --> 25:29.494
she holds a special place
in my heart

25:29.561 --> 25:31.062
and we basically family.

25:31.129 --> 25:32.397
{\an5}Why do you do that?

25:31.129 --> 25:32.397
You had it, you had it.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.065
{\an5}You had it.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.065
You had to bring that out of me?

25:34.132 --> 25:35.667
{\an1}I gotta jump up and do that.
We need to listen to that back.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.068
I bet that's the best run.

25:37.135 --> 25:40.272
My relationship with Miles
is hella complicated.

25:40.338 --> 25:42.007
Meeting the man of your life,

25:42.073 --> 25:45.377
you would expect your life
to be butterflies by now.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.512
I just knew I was gonna be
walking down that aisle,

25:47.579 --> 25:49.581
have my white dress,
have my kids,

25:49.648 --> 25:52.417
you know, my dog, you know,
white picket fence (bleep).

25:52.484 --> 25:53.952
And lately,
he's been distant

25:54.019 --> 25:56.988
and I need to know what's going
on inside this man's head.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.690
{\an5}This track is hot.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.690
Thank you.

25:58.757 --> 26:01.927
{\an5}It's a hit.

25:58.757 --> 26:01.927
You see how happy we could be
and you see how we are?

26:01.993 --> 26:03.194
{\an5}I miss that.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.194
You know what I mean?

26:03.261 --> 26:04.829
Like, this is so happy,
it's just so--

26:04.896 --> 26:06.531
Doesn't it feel,
like, comfortable?

26:06.598 --> 26:08.867
{\an4}This feels like home,
this is home.

26:06.598 --> 26:08.867
That's the first time, like...

26:08.934 --> 26:10.368
But you haven't
been here lately.

26:10.435 --> 26:13.305
Time is flying by and I'm just
figuring (bleep) out, like...

26:13.371 --> 26:15.407
{\an1}where the (bleep) I'm at in
my life, you know what I mean?

26:15.473 --> 26:17.509
{\an1}We always imagined
being signed by now.

26:17.575 --> 26:19.844
{\an1}And I need to figure out,
like, what I want.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.414
Well, I didn't
hear my name

26:22.480 --> 26:24.182
in any of that
that you just listed.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.285
Truth is, I've been pushing
Amber away for a reason.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.254
I fell in love
with somebody else.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.956
I know that I need to
tell her the truth,

26:31.022 --> 26:32.824
but at the end of the day,

26:32.891 --> 26:35.126
hurting Amber is
one of the hardest things

26:35.193 --> 26:36.728
I'm gonna ever have to do
in my life.

26:36.795 --> 26:39.030
But I know the time is coming
for me to tell her the truth.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.132
Today, I'm just not ready.

26:41.199 --> 26:42.667
{\an1}I just need you to just
kinda cope with me.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.102
I just need me time.

26:44.169 --> 26:45.971
I'm figuring (bleep) out in
my life and what's going on.

26:46.037 --> 26:47.472
But how long
is that gonna take?

26:47.539 --> 26:49.240
{\an1}I mean, you know, like,
three weeks, four weeks go by,

26:49.307 --> 26:50.842
a month, two months,

26:50.909 --> 26:53.345
{\an1}two month turn into six months,
six months turn into a year.

26:53.411 --> 26:55.413
{\an5}I don't know.

26:53.411 --> 26:55.413
{\an1}And you think I'm supposed to be
just sitting here fabulous,

26:55.480 --> 26:59.250
{\an5}like, and just waiting,
like, oh, my God, my man,
he'll be back next year.

26:59.317 --> 27:01.086
Where is he? I don't know,
he around the corner.

27:01.152 --> 27:02.854
{\an4}That's selfish of me,
to make you wait.

27:01.152 --> 27:02.854
It is selfish.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.289
{\an5}To make you wait.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.289
{\an3}Okay, so...

27:04.356 --> 27:05.657
{\an5}I'm not making you wait.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.657
So leave me alone.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.759
{\an1}I'm just saying, have my back,
be my friend right now.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.995
{\an1}I ain't got time to be sitting
here playing these games.

27:10.061 --> 27:12.864
And you already know me,
I'm gonna keep it moving.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.901
{\an8}It was never about
you and Ray.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.337
{\an8}It was more about
you telling him

27:19.404 --> 27:21.272
{\an7}you was gonna punch me
in the face when you see me.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.608
{\an7}You say that, but all the
(bleep) that I've been hearing

27:23.675 --> 27:25.610
{\an7}in the news about
you and him is that--

27:25.677 --> 27:28.046
{\an8}all violence.

27:25.677 --> 27:28.046
{\an8}Not true, not true.

27:28.113 --> 27:30.148
{\an7}So you want to know
who the (bleep) I am?

27:30.215 --> 27:31.816
{\an8}This is who I am.

27:30.215 --> 27:31.816
{\an9}Ray J.

27:31.883 --> 27:32.951
{\an7}You wanna know how
the (bleep) I turn up?

27:33.018 --> 27:34.719
{\an7}Well, this is the (bleep)
how I turn up.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.421

{\an8}Thank you, so do you.

28:20.899 --> 28:23.635
{\an7}I wanted to just let you know,
I invited Teairra.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.837
{\an5}You know, I wanted
to speak to her.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.837
{\an1}Oh, okay.

28:25.904 --> 28:28.273
{\an1}Because, it's like, I hear
about her and I hear the stuff

28:28.339 --> 28:29.774
she says about me,
so I just--

28:29.841 --> 28:31.709
I've just never had
a chance to speak to her.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.945
{\an1}Yeah, and I think that
the issue isn't so much you,

28:34.012 --> 28:35.346
that's what I feel like.

28:35.413 --> 28:36.948
{\an4}I feel like the issue
is more, like, Ray.

28:35.413 --> 28:36.948
{\an3}Yeah.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.517
{\an4}So it's, like, I just
wanted to let you know.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.517
Yeah. It's fine.

28:39.584 --> 28:42.387

{\an1}Hi.

28:57.969 --> 28:59.704
{\an5}(Teairra)
Like I told Apryl
on the beach,

28:59.771 --> 29:01.873
{\an8}I don't mind being in
the same room with Princess

29:01.940 --> 29:05.110
{\an8}as long as that bitch
can stay in her lane.

29:05.176 --> 29:06.845
So obviously, you know,
Princess here.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.546
I hope y'all can get along.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.315
{\an1}Well, it's nothing to get
along about, you know?

29:10.381 --> 29:11.883
{\an1}There's nothing to fight about.
There's nothing.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.885
No, I know,
but I'm just saying,

29:13.952 --> 29:16.488
{\an1}you know I gotta forewarn you,
if y'all do, like...

29:16.554 --> 29:17.856
{\an1}And I'm happy that
you are forewarning me,

29:17.922 --> 29:19.257
{\an5}I appreciate that.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.257
{\an3}Thank you.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.359
{\an5}Now have a little sip.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.359
Cheers to that.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.994
Hi, Teairra.

29:23.061 --> 29:24.629
{\an5}Hi, how are you?

29:23.061 --> 29:24.629
{\an1}Good.

29:24.696 --> 29:25.797
{\an5}I can move.
Here, take my seat.

29:24.696 --> 29:25.797
{\an1}You sure?

29:25.864 --> 29:27.332
{\an5}Yeah, uh-huh.

29:25.864 --> 29:27.332
{\an1}Okay.

29:27.398 --> 29:30.301
I'm trying my hardest not to get
caught up in the bull(bleep)

29:30.368 --> 29:33.238
and I hope this girl does not
start anything with me.

29:33.304 --> 29:35.173
I agreed to be in
the same room with the ho,

29:35.240 --> 29:37.809
but I did not agree
to talk to her.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.644
This is officially
the first time we've met.

29:39.711 --> 29:40.912
{\an5}It is.

29:39.711 --> 29:40.912
{\an3}Yes.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.280
{\an1}And it's unfortunate
because from the other times

29:42.347 --> 29:44.382
{\an1}that we've met,
I was a little bit turnt up.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.417
It was never
about you and Ray,

29:46.484 --> 29:49.854
it was more about
you telling him

29:49.921 --> 29:51.856
{\an1}you was gonna punch me
in the face when you see me.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.491
{\an5}Okay, so...

29:51.923 --> 29:53.491
Because you thought
I threw your bag away.

29:53.558 --> 29:55.860
So let me explain
one thing to you.

29:55.927 --> 29:58.062
{\an1}I would have never
come at you with violence

29:58.129 --> 30:00.165
{\an1}if your man had've
protected you.

30:00.231 --> 30:02.667
{\an1}Because I feel like he didn't
protect you by throwing you

30:02.734 --> 30:05.803
{\an1}out there to say you were the
one that threw my (bleep) away,

30:05.870 --> 30:07.438
so that's my first thing.

30:07.505 --> 30:09.541
{\an1}And then secondly,
you say that,

30:09.607 --> 30:11.543
{\an1}but all the (bleep) that
I've been hearing in the news

30:11.609 --> 30:13.912
{\an1}about you and him is that--
all violence.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.079
Not true, not true.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.148
{\an1}You beating him up
and then going to jail.

30:17.215 --> 30:18.583
Yeah, but that's not true.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.817
None of that is true.

30:19.884 --> 30:21.786
{\an1}Oh, okay. Okay.
Violence is violence, though.

30:21.853 --> 30:24.322
Violence is violence,
but I never broke no ribs,

30:24.389 --> 30:25.623
I never broke no ACL.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.325
Like, he took that
and ran with it.

30:27.392 --> 30:29.894
{\an5}(Teairra)
Princess should really know
what she's dealing with.

30:29.961 --> 30:31.896
I mean, I've been
through it all with Ray J

30:31.963 --> 30:35.767
and he does feed
information to the media.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.268
He does.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.903
And I feel like he's wrong.

30:38.970 --> 30:42.507
So, you know, I can't kick her
while she's down on this point

30:42.574 --> 30:45.543
because I know,
as a bare witness to this,

30:45.610 --> 30:47.145
that this is true.

30:47.212 --> 30:49.214
{\an1}He put it out there to
the world and that's not cool.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.317
{\an1}'Cause that's y'all personal
business, that's not okay.

30:52.383 --> 30:55.353
Let me tell you, when you put
something out there like that,

30:55.420 --> 30:58.189
{\an1}people look at it
and you don't want that.

30:58.256 --> 30:59.624
You don't want that.

31:01.926 --> 31:03.795
{\an1}You good?

31:03.861 --> 31:05.697
No, you're not.

31:05.763 --> 31:07.365
{\an1}You're not, baby,
and it's okay.

31:07.432 --> 31:09.267
You're not good
and it's okay.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.501
{\an1}You don't need to be
good all the time.

31:10.568 --> 31:13.204
It's okay to not be good.

31:13.271 --> 31:15.106
{\an1}If it's a happy
relationship,

31:15.173 --> 31:17.475
{\an1}if it's a relationship
that's meant to be,

31:17.542 --> 31:19.077
{\an1}you're supposed
to be happy.

31:19.143 --> 31:21.679
{\an1}You're supposed to not
feel a worry in the world.

31:21.746 --> 31:23.281
You're supposed to
feel like that man

31:23.348 --> 31:24.749
{\an1}is supposed to come
and protect you.

When Teairra spoke to me

31:27.285 --> 31:29.454
about deserving better,

31:29.520 --> 31:31.256
it kinda touched a soft spot

31:31.322 --> 31:34.359
and it was kinda awkward
because it was coming from her,

31:34.425 --> 31:37.428
but it was something
that I haven't heard before.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.697

it kinda touched me.

how the (bleep) I turn up?

38:16.060 --> 38:17.762
{\an1}Well, this is the (bleep)
how I turn up.

38:17.828 --> 38:19.196
We're done.

38:19.263 --> 38:21.699
{\an1}And you got some dirty-ass socks
on, so change your socks.

38:23.034 --> 38:26.537
{\an5}No, they're not.

38:23.034 --> 38:26.537
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

38:26.604 --> 38:28.172
Oh!

38:28.239 --> 38:30.541
(overlapping shouting)

38:30.608 --> 38:33.844
(Bleeping)

38:33.911 --> 38:35.713
What, bitch?

38:35.780 --> 38:37.415
{\an5}(Ray J)
No, you're not.
No, you're (bleep) not.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.250
No, you're not.
No, you're not.

38:39.316 --> 38:41.886
Bums!
All y'all bitches some bums!

38:41.952 --> 38:43.988
{\an1}Get the (bleep) out.
Yo, yo.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.723
Check this out,
check this out.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.658
Bum-ass bitch!

38:52.096 --> 38:54.198
{\an8}This season on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

38:54.265 --> 38:57.501
{\an7}I spoke with Teairra
and she was right about you.

38:57.568 --> 38:59.470
{\an7}I love you enough
to let you know

38:59.537 --> 39:02.973
{\an7}that I want to see you happy,
and you don't look happy to me.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.208
{\an8}You're a (bleep) up person

39:04.275 --> 39:06.143
{\an8}because you're unloyal
to everybody.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.379
{\an9}Bitch!

39:08.446 --> 39:10.681
{\an7}Bitch, I will (bleep) you up.
Don't (bleep) with me.

39:10.748 --> 39:13.350
{\an8}I've been on and off
with Soulja Boy.

39:13.417 --> 39:14.952
{\an8}What?

39:15.019 --> 39:16.087
{\an7}Are y'all (bleep)
or what, girl?

39:16.153 --> 39:17.655
{\an8}'Cause I like to know
the juicy questions.

39:17.722 --> 39:20.324
{\an8}Yes, we definitely were
a couple-- two weeks ago.

39:20.391 --> 39:22.760
{\an8}You try me,
you try my happiness.

39:22.827 --> 39:26.297
{\an8}I'm gonna (bleep)
you up.

39:26.363 --> 39:27.732
{\an7}You should be thanking me.
You're welcome.

39:27.798 --> 39:30.000
{\an8}I will never
thank a ho for anything.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.636
{\an8}A ho? Bitch...

39:30.067 --> 39:32.636
{\an8}(Bleep)!

39:32.703 --> 39:36.674
{\an8}(Omarion)
This is the biggest record
that I've ever had in my career.

39:36.741 --> 39:38.743
{\an8}But how does the balance
come down, Apryl?

39:38.809 --> 39:40.244
{\an8}Sharpen up and wait
for your moment.

39:40.311 --> 39:42.513
{\an8}But how are you able to
claim what my moment is?

39:42.580 --> 39:45.249
{\an8}(Miles)
I just want him to understand,
like, who I am,

39:45.316 --> 39:46.951
{\an8}what I am,
what I stand for.

39:47.017 --> 39:49.286
{\an8}It's my way of living, it's
my family, it's my religion.

39:49.353 --> 39:51.122
{\an7}All right, does his heart
involve Miles?

39:51.188 --> 39:53.357
{\an8}Like, I want you to move in,
I want us to be together.

39:53.424 --> 39:55.426
{\an8}I'm not ready to necessarily
take that step yet with you.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.995
{\an8}Get your ass
into the courtroom,

39:58.062 --> 40:00.698
{\an8}get full custody and let
her pay you what you need.

40:00.765 --> 40:03.634
{\an8}At least you can be
financially supported
and then go hire a nanny.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.870
{\an7}If you gonna be a parent
to Moniece, Marla,

40:05.936 --> 40:09.240
{\an8}I feel like you should support
her through her demise, period.

40:09.306 --> 40:11.075
{\an8}You don't care!

40:09.306 --> 40:11.075
{\an8}Stop it, stop it.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.476
{\an8}You have never cared.

40:12.543 --> 40:14.445
{\an8}Not until yesterday
did I get a glimpse

40:14.512 --> 40:16.480
{\an7}that you did not
have a support system.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.282
{\an7}You're attacking me
and I'm the one

40:18.349 --> 40:20.785
{\an7}that's been helping
all this time.

40:20.851 --> 40:22.620
{\an8}I look like
a (bleep) monster.

40:22.686 --> 40:25.122
{\an7}This is how we make our money,
you know what I'm saying?

40:22.686 --> 40:25.122
{\an4}Yeah.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.825
{\an7}This is why the bitch doesn't
know you (bleep) married.

40:27.892 --> 40:29.794
{\an7}Why don't you wear your ring
when you're going to the--

40:29.860 --> 40:31.896
{\an7}Let me tell you something.
Since you care about
this ring so much?

40:31.962 --> 40:33.430
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.430
{\an8}You can have it.

40:34.865 --> 40:36.300
{\an8}No!

40:36.367 --> 40:37.701
{\an8}(woman)
I think he's been wanting
to tell you a while.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.070
{\an8}The fact that you're doing that,
that's the problem.

40:40.137 --> 40:41.739
{\an8}Nikki, and you damn sure not
gonna talk to me like that,

40:41.806 --> 40:43.941
{\an8}'cause I'll beat your ass.

40:41.806 --> 40:43.941
{\an9}Please do.

40:44.008 --> 40:46.110
{\an7}Take--

40:44.008 --> 40:46.110
{\an8}Yo... yo, get up outta here.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.344
{\an8}Get up outta here.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.344
{\an8}You not gonna touch me.

40:47.411 --> 40:48.245
{\an8}Get up outta here.

40:47.411 --> 40:48.245
{\an8}You're not gonna touch me.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.615
It's a cold world
out here, honey.

40:51.682 --> 40:53.717
It is, it's Hollywood.
The streets is mean, baby.

40:53.784 --> 40:56.120
Everybody looking
for they next come-up.
