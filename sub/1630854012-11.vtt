WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:03.916
Let him go!

00:05.396 --> 00:07.746
You even hit Courtney.
It was an accident!

00:07.746 --> 00:09.748
But you haven't been
acting like yourself, Rick.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.141
It's that hourglass.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.490
<i>You've been wearing it
for too long.</i>

00:12.490 --> 00:14.144
Come with us.
I can't.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.145
I think that thing
is one of my dad's

00:15.145 --> 00:17.017
<i>crazy science experiments.</i>

00:20.237 --> 00:22.413
It was a giant
mutant gorilla.

00:22.413 --> 00:23.588
Yeah, a white one.

00:23.588 --> 00:24.633
If the Ultra-Humanite

00:24.633 --> 00:26.243
is as powerful as you say,

00:26.243 --> 00:29.072
it'll take everyone
to stop him,

00:29.072 --> 00:30.291
including the Mahkents.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.642
What the hell?

00:33.642 --> 00:35.122
What is this?

00:39.169 --> 00:41.128
At least
you'll die together.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.957
<i>He killed people
to get what he wanted,</i>

00:44.957 --> 00:46.785
and he was about to kill
so many more.

00:46.785 --> 00:49.701
Who killed my father?

00:49.701 --> 00:51.355
I did it.

01:03.454 --> 01:04.847
<i>Court!</i>

01:09.982 --> 01:12.463
I won't let you stop me.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.209
Courtney!

01:19.209 --> 01:21.124
You can never save America.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.300
You're filled
with too much hate.

01:30.351 --> 01:32.222
Ah! Gotcha.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.364
You saved my life.

01:43.364 --> 01:44.843
Just returning the favor.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.951
Does this mean
I get to be in JSA?

03:54.451 --> 03:57.324
- What the hell?
- What's going on, man?

03:58.107 --> 04:00.631
- What?
- Man, it's leg day.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.699
<i>The Ultra-Humanite killed
The Gambler.</i>

05:08.699 --> 05:10.745
He tore into his trailer
and stabbed him

05:10.745 --> 05:12.355
in the heart with a claw.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.488
Didn't see any claws.
More likely his teeth.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.707
They were big and sharp.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.579
However he was killed,

05:18.579 --> 05:21.625
this is exactly why I've been
asking us to work together.

05:21.625 --> 05:25.542
Whether you belong to the JSA
or the ISA,

05:25.542 --> 05:27.631
our town needs us again.

05:27.631 --> 05:30.808
Now, I know
putting the past behind us

05:30.808 --> 05:32.984
has been challenging
for everybody.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.465
Yeah. Me especially.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.554
But you're working at it, Sylvester,

05:37.554 --> 05:41.384
and well, that's what matters.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.994
And we've made progress.

05:42.994 --> 05:44.518
The Crocks are with us,

05:44.518 --> 05:47.608
and I think we can get Cindy
back on board.

05:47.608 --> 05:50.262
Why are we bothering
with Cindy again?

05:50.262 --> 05:51.438
Because she's already
on the hunt

05:51.438 --> 05:52.439
for the Ultra-Humanite.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.615
So she might know
what he's up to.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.660
Cindy seemed pretty firm
about working solo.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.402
Whatever grand plan
the Ultra-Humanite might have,

05:59.402 --> 06:01.491
if history's taught us anything,

06:01.491 --> 06:04.538
it's that it'll involve hurting
a lot of people,

06:04.538 --> 06:06.191
including us.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.802
'Cause, guys...

06:07.802 --> 06:09.412
This ain't no Donkey Kong.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.674
Yeah. If we don't stop him,

06:10.674 --> 06:12.459
it'll be game over.

06:15.592 --> 06:16.985
1981, guys.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.598
You know,
you don't have to do a joke

06:21.598 --> 06:23.426
on top of every joke
that I do.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.428
It's called banter, Pat.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.777
All superheroes use it

06:26.777 --> 06:29.519
during stressful situations
to defuse tension.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.173
I know. It just seems
like you feel like you

06:31.173 --> 06:33.305
always gotta get the last word
in on me--just, you know...

06:33.305 --> 06:34.437
I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.396
See? Right there.
You're doing it.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.187
Oh, is this what you want?
No banter?

06:45.187 --> 06:46.449
Just an overly serious conversation

06:46.449 --> 06:47.711
that scares the hell
out of everyone?

06:47.711 --> 06:49.931
- Guys, stop.
- Sorry, Barb.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.411
Sorry, Barb.

06:53.587 --> 06:58.505
Okay, banter aside,
we need the Mahkents too.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.682
And we need Cameron.

07:01.682 --> 07:02.857
You mean you do.

07:02.857 --> 07:05.250
He's as powerful
as his father was.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.600
Yeah, but if we all team up

07:06.600 --> 07:08.515
and then
the Mahkents put me on ice

07:08.515 --> 07:10.560
because they figured out
that I ran their son over--

07:10.560 --> 07:12.649
- They won't.
- How do you know that?

07:13.520 --> 07:16.218
Because they think
I killed Jordan.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.220
- What?
- Why do they think that?

07:18.220 --> 07:19.221
It's not important.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.404
Careful.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.939
Have you seen my parents?

08:50.834 --> 08:52.401
Mother.

08:54.272 --> 08:57.449
Jordan?

09:06.589 --> 09:08.112
Oh! Oh!

09:24.955 --> 09:26.087
Papa!

09:34.269 --> 09:35.270
Dad?

09:41.755 --> 09:43.104
Cameron.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.631
I'm home.

10:02.819 --> 10:03.951
I brought one of these back

10:03.951 --> 10:08.869
from every business trip
I ever took...

10:08.869 --> 10:10.479
like a trophy.

10:14.831 --> 10:19.140
Your mother used to love
how simple, and yet beautiful,

10:19.140 --> 10:21.838
the worlds inside of them are.

10:24.754 --> 10:28.410
Collecting these
after she died...

10:30.630 --> 10:33.633
Was my way of honoring her.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.376
One is missing.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.161
Where have you been, Dad?

10:44.339 --> 10:45.906
When I was hit, I lost

10:45.906 --> 10:47.821
not only my form,

10:47.821 --> 10:50.780
but all self-awareness.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.695
I had no consciousness.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.872
Just... dreams.

10:55.872 --> 11:00.790
Dreams of you, of your mother,
of our family.

11:00.790 --> 11:04.402
It took everything I had
to reform.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.796
Why didn't you heal here?

11:06.796 --> 11:08.842
Why let us think you were dead?

11:11.496 --> 11:14.761
Son...

11:14.761 --> 11:16.327
I was trying to protect you.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.938
Protect me from what?

11:21.898 --> 11:24.684
Your grandparents,

11:24.684 --> 11:28.644
they explained everything
to you, right?

11:33.562 --> 11:37.609
Our family was hunted
for generations.

11:38.785 --> 11:42.789
To bring you into that history
would've put you in danger,

11:42.789 --> 11:44.138
because once you knew--

11:50.013 --> 11:52.668
I know how hard it is
to keep our secret

11:52.668 --> 11:54.409
from those you hold close.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.109
You told Courtney.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.459
Then this happened.

12:04.288 --> 12:08.640
Courtney told me she
was the one who killed you.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.687
But she failed.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.602
No, Mother.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.431
It wasn't Courtney who did it.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.215
It was her brother.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.087
Mike?

12:20.087 --> 12:21.697
Then why would
she tell me that?

12:21.697 --> 12:23.786
To protect him.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.658
But that's all in the past now.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.095
And I've forgiven him.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.752
I've forgiven all of them,
because they believe

12:32.752 --> 12:34.231
what they were doing was right.

12:35.842 --> 12:39.497
And after what happened,

12:39.497 --> 12:42.457
my powers
are somehow even stronger.

12:46.156 --> 12:49.681
Courtney says
you've killed people, Dad.

12:49.681 --> 12:53.163
My goal was only ever
to help people.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.774
You know that.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.079
You know me.

12:57.428 --> 12:58.690
I thought I did.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.871
Son...

13:07.830 --> 13:09.745
My son,

13:09.745 --> 13:13.227
almost losing my life,
almost losing you,

13:13.227 --> 13:16.447
and listening
to Courtney Whitmore,

13:16.447 --> 13:21.017
it made me look at my past
actions in a different light.

13:21.017 --> 13:24.238
Courtney's group and I,
we--we want the same thing.

13:26.675 --> 13:31.767
We could just never agree
on how we should achieve that.

13:32.376 --> 13:35.902
But I think maybe now we can.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.519
Yes, Father.

13:44.519 --> 13:47.827
I want peace.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.794
<i>Guys, I've picked up
a signal</i>

13:58.794 --> 14:00.100
<i>from Sportsmaster's mask.</i>

14:00.100 --> 14:02.232
<i>It's coming from
under Blue Valley,</i>

14:02.232 --> 14:05.018
<i>and I think I've found
an access point.</i>

14:21.382 --> 14:23.166
Hold up, Artemis.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.829
Where's Rick?

14:33.829 --> 14:35.787
He didn't return my calls.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.833
Well, we can't wait for him.

14:42.838 --> 14:46.015
Do you think the Mahkents
did anything to the Crocks

14:46.015 --> 14:47.930
or maybe that animal did?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.584
If that white ape
hurt my parents,

14:49.584 --> 14:51.151
I'm gonna skin it alive.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.109
The signal's
getting stronger.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.111
We're on the right path.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.029
There it is, behind that door.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.465
Maybe we should suit up.

15:01.465 --> 15:03.685
- Where's the staff?
- Sylvester has it.

15:03.685 --> 15:06.427
He's trying to get on
the Ultra-Humanite's trail.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.909
Artemis, wait!

15:11.649 --> 15:13.651
Mom? Dad?

15:18.178 --> 15:20.832
This is command central
for our peeping Tom.

15:20.832 --> 15:24.271
- But who was it?
- Ultra-Humanite?

15:24.271 --> 15:27.839
This room's too small
for a giant mutant gorilla.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.976
Look.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.065
What is that?

15:36.065 --> 15:40.069
- Oh, my God.
- What, Beth?

15:41.810 --> 15:44.421
Courtney...

15:44.421 --> 15:46.162
these are human remains.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.921
Artemis. Hey.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.575
Hey, Court.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.251
Wh-what is it?

17:27.307 --> 17:30.440
Barbara, you're never
gonna believe it.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.703
What?

17:32.703 --> 17:34.575
He's back!

17:34.575 --> 17:35.924
He's back.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.194
Hello, Barbara.

18:15.355 --> 18:18.314
It's good to see you, Barbara.

18:18.314 --> 18:21.143
I saw you die.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.580
I know.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.452
How?

18:27.367 --> 18:30.718
I wasn't sure myself
at first,

18:30.718 --> 18:33.112
but it seems
my abilities extend

18:33.112 --> 18:35.505
beyond just creating ice.

18:35.505 --> 18:39.074
I can somehow become it.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.945
What do you want?

18:40.945 --> 18:43.557
I want my life back.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.995
My death can be explained away
easily enough

18:46.995 --> 18:50.433
as misinformation
after a tragic accident.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.393
No one will believe it.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.264
They already have.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.353
They want to believe it,

18:57.353 --> 19:01.531
because the people
of Blue Valley love me.

19:03.664 --> 19:07.233
I've lost a year of my life, Barbara.

19:07.233 --> 19:12.412
A year away from my son,
my parents, my work.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.761
I know I can't get
that time back,

19:13.761 --> 19:16.242
but I can put the past
behind me,

19:16.242 --> 19:19.941
start over, rebuild.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.943
Trust me, Barbara.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.814
I'm a changed man.

19:23.814 --> 19:26.208
I've seen who you are, Jordan.

19:28.819 --> 19:33.172
You're pure evil.
You'll never change.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.348
But I have.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.263
And who do we have to thank?

19:37.263 --> 19:40.570
It's ironic, maybe, or fitting.

19:40.570 --> 19:44.400
Your daughter, Courtney,
showed me it was possible.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.143
She believes in people
in a way that I never did.

19:48.143 --> 19:51.059
Yeah.
In a way that you never will.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.366
But I want to.

19:53.366 --> 19:55.803
I wanna wipe the slate clean.

19:55.803 --> 19:58.371
And to show I mean business,
I am willing to help the JSA

19:58.371 --> 20:00.286
take down the Ultra-Humanite.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.463
How do you know about that?

20:03.463 --> 20:07.031
I've been watching
Blue Valley for some time.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.904
That creature followed
Sylvester Pemberton here.

20:09.904 --> 20:13.037
The Ultra-Humanite
hated the ISA

20:13.037 --> 20:14.735
just as much as the JSA,

20:14.735 --> 20:18.347
because we refused to accept
him into our organization.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.308
He didn't freeze
Crusher and Paula.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.744
It was you.

20:25.354 --> 20:29.402
I didn't want to, Barbara.
I didn't set out to.

20:29.402 --> 20:32.796
They came in,
and it happened so fast.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.496
It was terrible,

20:36.496 --> 20:39.368
but it can end there.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.240
All of it.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.030
When you're ready
to accept my help

20:49.030 --> 20:52.425
against the Ultra-Humanite,
let me know.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.785
It really is good
to see you, Barbara.

21:55.705 --> 21:59.361
Come out, come out,
wherever you are,

21:59.361 --> 22:01.363
you damn dirty ape.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.064
<i>Sylvester?</i>

22:09.066 --> 22:09.980
Yeah.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.547
I've been trying to call you.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.332
Reception's spotty.
What's up?

22:15.508 --> 22:17.553
We found the Crocks.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.860
What's left of them.

22:19.860 --> 22:23.211
<i>What? The Ultra-Humanite?</i>

22:23.211 --> 22:24.821
No.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.521
Icicle's back.

22:32.263 --> 22:33.482
I thought Icicle was dead.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.005
<i>He's already gone public.</i>

22:35.005 --> 22:36.703
<i>Showed up at
the American Dream.</i>

22:36.703 --> 22:38.487
<i>We need to regroup.</i>

22:41.447 --> 22:43.231
Sylvester?

23:08.125 --> 23:10.998
Hey, calm down, all right?
Just take it easy.

23:10.998 --> 23:13.261
I'm taking Icicle out
the first chance I get.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.437
Executing him
is not the way to handle it--

23:15.437 --> 23:17.657
That creep killed me!

23:17.657 --> 23:19.267
I know. I was there.

23:19.267 --> 23:22.836
Jordan Mahkent put me
in the ground.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.098
And I buried you,

23:24.098 --> 23:25.839
and I don't want
to do it again.

23:25.839 --> 23:29.843
And all this talk about unity
and second chances?

23:29.843 --> 23:31.714
We gotta draw the line somewhere,

23:31.714 --> 23:33.803
and Icicle is it!

23:33.803 --> 23:36.545
But we have to act together
as a team.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.547
Why bother?

23:38.547 --> 23:40.506
You tried that before,

23:40.506 --> 23:42.682
and Icicle is--surprise--

23:42.682 --> 23:44.161
not dead!

23:44.161 --> 23:45.511
But we all thought
that he was dead.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.643
Well, you should have
made sure.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.428
You gotta check your work, Pat.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.560
If you had, none of this
would be happening.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.257
I'm just saying
we have to have a plan.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.477
There's a way to take care
of Jordan Mahkent

23:55.477 --> 23:57.479
and handle the Ultra-Humanite.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.611
They're sworn enemies.

23:58.611 --> 24:01.744
We can use that
to our advantage.

24:01.744 --> 24:05.313
You're not suggesting
we lean into this nonsense

24:05.313 --> 24:08.664
Icicle's been spouting off
about teaming up

24:08.664 --> 24:10.579
and letting things go?

24:10.579 --> 24:13.016
Bygones, my ass!

24:13.016 --> 24:14.670
Hey, that's not
what I'm saying.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.499
The plan is this!

24:17.499 --> 24:19.849
I'm taking out Icicle myself

24:19.849 --> 24:22.722
whether anyone approves of it
or not.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.450
What are you doing here?

24:55.450 --> 24:58.322
I know you heard.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.847
My dad's back.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.762
It's a miracle.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.765
It is...

25:05.765 --> 25:08.724
surprising, yeah.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.858
I mean, it's--it's unreal.

25:11.858 --> 25:15.514
It--it means
everything has changed.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.603
Nothing has changed.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.561
Cameron, he's been back
for one day,

25:19.561 --> 25:21.694
and Artemis's parents are dead.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.611
I know.

25:25.611 --> 25:28.570
And that is--is awful, okay?

25:28.570 --> 25:30.050
And he feels horrible about it,

25:30.050 --> 25:31.660
but it was self-defense, okay?

25:31.660 --> 25:34.533
He thought
they were attacking him.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.709
Why would they do that?

25:36.709 --> 25:38.319
He was wearing a mask,

25:38.319 --> 25:39.625
a suit that was
helping him heal.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.148
And they didn't know
who he was,

25:41.148 --> 25:42.628
so they probably just jumped
to conclusions--

25:42.628 --> 25:44.630
Your father hasn't
taken responsibility

25:44.630 --> 25:46.936
for any of his actions.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.459
He's accountable--

25:48.459 --> 25:49.678
Courtney,
where was the accountability

25:49.678 --> 25:52.246
for the Crocks or Cindy?

25:52.246 --> 25:54.422
How can you say
they deserve a second chance,

25:54.422 --> 25:55.989
but my dad doesn't?

26:03.823 --> 26:07.130
He wants us to live in peace,

26:07.130 --> 26:09.785
as a family.

26:09.785 --> 26:11.700
Isn't that what you want too?

26:17.750 --> 26:19.795
Did he send you here?

26:21.449 --> 26:23.625
No.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.453
Courtney, no.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.987
Whatever happened before--

26:37.987 --> 26:41.817
between us, with my dad--

26:41.817 --> 26:43.166
things can be different now.

26:43.166 --> 26:47.170
We can work together
like you always wanted.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.042
He told me that.

26:49.042 --> 26:51.044
Even my grandmother's agreed.

26:52.915 --> 26:55.744
Let's just start over.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.487
Please.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.756
Think about it.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.439
Okay.

27:57.632 --> 28:00.548
Okay. I got a good one.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.899
Okay. What is it?

28:03.899 --> 28:06.510
I'm gonna wish that Icicle
didn't have his powers.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.947
Yeah.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.600
Yeah, that is a great idea.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.472
'Cause then he can't turn me
into a popsicle,

28:11.472 --> 28:12.647
and the team
will have no problem

28:12.647 --> 28:14.388
dragging his ass to jail.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.437
I wish that Jordan Mahkent,

28:20.437 --> 28:21.961
the man also known
more commonly

28:21.961 --> 28:25.094
by the Justice Society
of America as Icicle,

28:25.094 --> 28:29.795
and currently residing
in Blue Valley, Nebraska,

28:29.795 --> 28:32.798
did not have the ability
to freeze me or my friends,

28:32.798 --> 28:34.669
because he was
just a normal human being

28:34.669 --> 28:36.976
without powers of any kind.

28:36.976 --> 28:37.977
Amen.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.674
<i>I'm sorry, Jakeem.</i>

28:39.674 --> 28:41.763
<i>I can't do that.</i>

28:41.763 --> 28:43.112
What? Why not?

28:43.112 --> 28:44.810
<i>Because if I took
his powers away,</i>

28:44.810 --> 28:46.768
<i>I'd kill him, and you know
I can't kill anyone.</i>

28:46.768 --> 28:48.248
His powers
are keeping him alive?

28:48.248 --> 28:49.466
What did you do to him?

28:49.466 --> 28:50.946
Well, I hit him with a truck.

28:50.946 --> 28:53.644
Turned him into slush.
I saved everyone!

28:56.691 --> 28:58.693
Listen, you dumb pen!

28:58.693 --> 28:59.825
You take his powers away,
and you kill him,

28:59.825 --> 29:01.348
but if you don't
take his powers away,

29:01.348 --> 29:02.741
you're killing
way more people,

29:02.741 --> 29:03.829
probably including me!

29:03.829 --> 29:05.482
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

29:05.482 --> 29:07.354
<i>I can't do what you're asking.</i>

29:08.181 --> 29:10.749
All right.
Well, we need to keep thinking.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.970
You're gonna need help
with that.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.842
Cindy!

29:16.842 --> 29:19.845
By the way,
the doors were unlocked.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.237
I could have been
Jordan Mahkent.

29:21.237 --> 29:22.848
Where would you be then?

29:23.979 --> 29:25.720
Probably frozen.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.679
Burman,
what are you doing here?

29:30.072 --> 29:32.248
Well, with everything
going on,

29:32.248 --> 29:36.992
I decided it's a lot
for anyone to do alone,

29:36.992 --> 29:39.560
especially for you two.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.997
So let's team up.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.350
Really?

29:47.350 --> 29:48.961
Yeah, sure. Why not?

29:50.092 --> 29:51.920
Welcome
to the Young All-Stars!

29:51.920 --> 29:55.489
Uh, yeah, we're gonna
have to work on that name.

29:55.489 --> 29:56.838
Okay.

29:58.971 --> 30:01.930
She's sitting on my bed.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.802
<i>Smooth.</i>

30:15.770 --> 30:19.339
He's a talented boy, my son.

30:19.339 --> 30:20.906
Takes after his mother.

30:24.735 --> 30:25.998
Hello, Courtney.

30:29.479 --> 30:34.136
Whatever you're doing,
whatever you're planning,

30:34.136 --> 30:35.529
we're going to stop you.

30:40.012 --> 30:42.231
I know you and Cameron
have been seeing each other.

30:42.231 --> 30:44.190
Of course you do.
You've been spying on us.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.888
My son
is all that matters to me.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.934
And if you're important to him,

30:48.934 --> 30:50.674
you're important to me.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.328
I don't want to be enemies, Courtney.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.243
I want us to be allies.

30:54.243 --> 30:57.464
I really do think we could be
a great team, you and I.

31:00.728 --> 31:02.861
I'll be honest.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.820
Revenge was the first thing
that overtook me

31:05.820 --> 31:08.040
when I first regained sentience.

31:09.041 --> 31:13.262
But I see now
that vengeance has no purpose.

31:13.262 --> 31:14.916
It's misguided.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.004
Primitive, even.

31:16.004 --> 31:18.789
And you helped me see that,

31:18.789 --> 31:19.921
because the more
I watched you, Courtney,

31:19.921 --> 31:23.098
the more I saw
who you truly are.

31:23.098 --> 31:25.709
You've changed
countless hearts and minds.

31:25.709 --> 31:28.147
The Shade, Cindy Burman,
the Crocks.

31:28.147 --> 31:31.063
Right before you killed them.

31:31.063 --> 31:34.936
Yes, that was regrettable,
but--

31:34.936 --> 31:38.244
You murdered
the Zarick family.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.246
You tried to brainwash
half the country

31:40.246 --> 31:43.249
and didn't care
that it would kill millions.

31:43.249 --> 31:45.381
You murdered the JSA.

31:45.381 --> 31:47.079
No one can just ignore that.

31:47.079 --> 31:50.560
I'm not asking you
to forget.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.302
I'm just hoping you'll forgive.

31:54.869 --> 31:57.959
We can work together,
all of us.

31:59.047 --> 32:02.224
And then you and Cameron
can start again.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.058
Thanks for hearing me out.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.175
Artemis?

34:19.013 --> 34:21.668
Come back over.

34:21.668 --> 34:23.452

Courtney should be here

36:29.230 --> 36:32.015
She has to agree to this, Pat.

36:32.015 --> 36:34.104
She has to.

36:34.104 --> 36:37.020
She doesn't have
to do anything.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.457
What am I supposed to do?

36:40.459 --> 36:43.113
Well, we're just--
we're just talking.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.378
I want to go after Icicle.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.339
Jordan says he wants
to work together.

36:51.339 --> 36:53.515
We all know that's a lie.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.082
What if it isn't?

36:55.082 --> 36:57.476
Oh, come on, Courtney.

36:57.476 --> 36:59.173
After everything you've been
through since you've picked up

36:59.173 --> 37:02.176
that staff,
how can you be that naive?

37:02.176 --> 37:04.178
- Hey, Sylvester.
- I'm just saying,

37:04.178 --> 37:07.225
he is just playing us
like he always has.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.662
And if he's sworn enemies
with the Ultra-Humanite,

37:09.662 --> 37:15.494
then Jordan Mahkent is using us
to save him from that monster.

37:15.494 --> 37:17.844
I mean, hell, for all we know,
it came back to Blue Valley

37:17.844 --> 37:20.238
looking for the ISA, not us.

37:23.284 --> 37:26.113
After all the support
I've given you,

37:26.113 --> 37:27.680
I'm asking you.

37:29.116 --> 37:32.511
Let me take the staff

37:32.511 --> 37:36.602
and face the man
who killed me and my friends.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.362
Dad?

39:33.893 --> 39:35.764
It's time.

39:59.658 --> 40:00.615
Greg, move your head.
