He freelances with various

09:33.556 --> 09:36.023
I was thinking more like...

09:36.025 --> 09:38.158
take over the drug trade
for Christmas,

09:38.160 --> 09:40.060
burn it down by New Year's.

09:40.062 --> 09:41.629
That sounds like
a hell of a party.

09:41.631 --> 09:43.063
You got plans?

09:43.065 --> 09:45.732
Going back to stalking
the ex-girlfriend again?

09:45.734 --> 09:47.234
Thinking more like Aruba.

09:47.236 --> 09:49.503
Something about
killing a citizen

09:49.505 --> 09:51.238

kick back on a beach.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.907
I'm not ready to see you
in a speedo.

09:53.909 --> 09:57.611
And don't consider Daniel Casey
a citizen.

09:57.613 --> 10:00.680
He waived that right
when he stole state secrets.

10:00.682 --> 10:03.349
They still want us
to take his teeth?

10:03.351 --> 10:04.751
Proof of death.

10:04.753 --> 10:06.586
Couple molars should do it.

10:06.588 --> 10:10.156
DNA swab's a lot easier
to get through airport security

10:10.158 --> 10:11.858
than a whole bag full of teeth.

10:11.860 --> 10:13.760
I don't make the rules.

<i>That tall drink of water?</i>

10:20.135 --> 10:23.769

10:23.771 --> 10:25.538
He's not one of ours.

10:25.540 --> 10:29.542
Looks local,
not foreign government.

10:29.544 --> 10:30.609
My guess?
Private military.

10:31.946 --> 10:33.812
Maybe Casey hired some muscle.

10:33.814 --> 10:35.781
Think we should
take him out first?

10:35.783 --> 10:37.016
Let's keep him in play.

10:37.018 --> 10:39.217
See what he does.

10:39.219 --> 10:40.385
If he's a problem,
we'll put him in the ground

10:40.387 --> 10:42.555
along with Casey.

10:47.527 --> 10:50.062
I got eyes on Casey, Finch,

10:50.064 --> 10:51.796

government have a jump on him.

10:51.798 --> 10:53.998
You need to get to Casey
before they do, Mr. dillinger.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.334
Yeah, I'm aware
of the stakes, thank you.

11:37.008 --> 11:38.909

he was talking about.

11:41.446 --> 11:43.246

<i>(Dillinger) Yeah, well, I'm in
a pretty primo spot myself.</i>

to ensure your safety.

12:37.801 --> 12:38.967

as snapping your fingers.

12:41.672 --> 12:43.572
It is for me.

12:43.574 --> 12:44.673
I'm not exactly the guy
everyone's gonna wonder about

12:44.675 --> 12:46.675
at their high school reunion.

12:46.677 --> 12:48.309
And probably why this group
picked me in the first place.

12:48.311 --> 12:49.778
If we're to proceed,

12:49.780 --> 12:51.146
you'll need to tell me more
about that group.

12:51.148 --> 12:53.682
Look at it from my position.

12:53.684 --> 12:56.284

from folks reporting crimes

at all?

13:05.595 --> 13:07.828

But for that
to mean anything, Mr. Casey...

outlived his usefulness.

20:07.718 --> 20:11.052
And he was dealt with
accordingly.

20:11.054 --> 20:15.624
You might consider him
a cautionary tale.

20:15.626 --> 20:17.626
Why don't you
make yourself useful?

20:17.628 --> 20:20.629
Put this mess to bed
by morning.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.736
Here's the problem.

20:27.738 --> 20:30.772
My supervisor wants
this wrapped up ASAP.

20:30.774 --> 20:34.876
If you don't start talking,
my partner will get involved.

20:34.878 --> 20:38.846
You don't want to interrupt her
while she's eating.

20:38.848 --> 20:40.981
<i>Who do you work for?</i>

20:40.983 --> 20:46.020
And what do you want
with Daniel Casey?

20:46.022 --> 20:50.324
[Scottish accent]
Good cop, bad cop?

20:50.326 --> 20:51.925
[Chuckles]

20:51.927 --> 20:55.663
Don't make me laugh.

20:55.665 --> 20:58.265
If I wasn't in this chair...

20:58.267 --> 21:01.368
I'd snap your neck like a twig.

21:01.370 --> 21:02.970
[Pats him]

21:02.972 --> 21:06.006
Tried to warn you pal.

21:06.008 --> 21:09.509
There's just one minor problem
with that.

21:09.511 --> 21:13.547
You <i>are</i> in the chair.

21:13.549 --> 21:16.883
God, I love this stuff.

21:16.885 --> 21:20.554
You know what I like the most?

21:24.458 --> 21:26.493
[Muffled screaming]

21:26.495 --> 21:29.729
Can't get enough of it.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.168
Rad.

21:35.170 --> 21:37.870
Excuse me?

21:37.872 --> 21:39.605
Your setup.

21:39.607 --> 21:41.908
I've never seen a unix
variant like that before.

21:41.910 --> 21:44.810
- It's rad.
- Thank you.

21:44.812 --> 21:46.477
But I don't see
your battery backup.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.413
What happens
when the power goes out?

21:48.415 --> 21:50.248
The library is powered
by a few gas generators

21:50.250 --> 21:51.717
scattered around the building.

21:51.719 --> 21:53.885
As long as there's fuel,
the lights stay on.

21:53.887 --> 21:56.421
Off the grid.

21:56.423 --> 21:58.924
Looks like I came
to the right place.

21:58.926 --> 22:01.859
You seem to know your way around
systems pretty well, Mr. Casey.

22:01.861 --> 22:03.261
I grew up in Tucson.

22:03.263 --> 22:06.364
You gotta do something
to pass the time.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.065
I started coding
when I was ten.

22:08.067 --> 22:12.002
I could debug a system easier
than carry a conversation.

22:12.004 --> 22:14.038
Guess I was never much
of a people person.

22:14.040 --> 22:17.241
I'd say you're doing
just fine for now.

22:17.243 --> 22:19.008
But I do know what you mean.

22:19.010 --> 22:21.345
Sometimes people
can be rather complicated.

22:21.347 --> 22:24.281
A computer only does what
you've programmed it to do.

22:24.283 --> 22:26.082
Exactly.

22:26.084 --> 22:29.953
At least that's
what I used to think.

22:37.394 --> 22:39.896
- What's that? - What I spent
the last two months working on.

22:39.898 --> 22:42.098
And probably why
everyone's trying to kill me.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.532
What can you tell me
about the work you were doing

22:43.534 --> 22:46.770
for the government?

22:46.772 --> 22:48.204
Started out as a normal job.

22:48.206 --> 22:50.039
Some system
they wanted me to test.

22:50.041 --> 22:51.707
They put me up in a motel.

22:51.709 --> 22:53.976
No phone, no TV,
guards around the clock.

22:53.978 --> 22:57.613
They'd drive me to and from
the facility blindfolded.

22:57.615 --> 22:59.248
I mean, I didn't even know
what state I was in.

22:59.250 --> 23:02.285
Seems a bit excessive.
All that secrecy.

23:02.287 --> 23:05.288
Yeah, it almost seemed worth it
once I saw the system.

23:05.290 --> 23:08.924
It was the most complicated
layout I'd ever seen.

23:08.926 --> 23:10.893
Not to mention,
the strongest heap of hardware

23:10.895 --> 23:12.327
I've ever tried to breach.

23:12.329 --> 23:14.229
Nothing I threw at it
made a dent.

23:14.231 --> 23:16.598
So you were unable
to find a weakness.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.066
Well, not until
I found something

23:18.068 --> 23:19.768
hidden in the BIOS interface.

23:19.770 --> 23:22.470
A backdoor. Took me straight
into the operating system.

23:22.472 --> 23:23.838
A backdoor.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.640
I was in.

23:25.642 --> 23:28.176
Managed to get a few bits
of code onto the laptop

23:28.178 --> 23:30.945
before the system woke up
and bit me.

23:30.947 --> 23:33.981
It adapted to my hack.
Locked me out.

23:33.983 --> 23:36.484
The code you pulled...

23:36.486 --> 23:38.353
any idea what it was?

23:38.355 --> 23:40.922
It's so advanced
it's almost alien.

23:40.924 --> 23:42.589
I've been able
to isolate a few strings

23:42.591 --> 23:44.258
of nine-digit numbers, but...

23:44.260 --> 23:46.127
no clue what they mean.

23:46.129 --> 23:48.329
(Finch) What happened after
the system locked you out?

23:48.331 --> 23:49.864
<i>(Casey)</i>
<i>I couldn't shake this feeling</i>

23:49.866 --> 23:51.765
<i>that I wasn't testing</i>
<i>the system.</i>

23:51.767 --> 23:53.935
I was showing the government
how to break into it.

23:53.937 --> 23:55.536
So I told them I was finished,

23:55.538 --> 23:58.104
thanks for the gig.

23:58.106 --> 23:59.640
Then I felt a needle
in my neck.

23:59.642 --> 24:01.408
And I blacked out.

24:01.410 --> 24:02.843
I woke up
in the trunk of a car,

24:02.845 --> 24:05.612
with a suicide note
in my pocket.

24:05.614 --> 24:07.214
Figured they planned
on killing me somewhere

24:07.216 --> 24:08.782
and making it look like
I did it myself.

24:08.784 --> 24:11.284
How did you manage to escape?

24:11.286 --> 24:12.419
Well, the car must have been
going a hundred miles an hour

24:12.421 --> 24:13.753
in the driving rain.

24:13.755 --> 24:15.855
There was an accident.
Bad.

24:15.857 --> 24:17.189
I got out of that car

24:17.191 --> 24:18.358
because it was wrapped
around a pole.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.025
Two guys
in the front were dead.

24:20.027 --> 24:21.427
I grabbed my bag,

24:21.429 --> 24:24.263
took the cash
in their wallets and ran.

24:24.265 --> 24:28.033
Thought I'd be safe
calling the SSCI, but...

24:28.035 --> 24:29.602
we know how that turned out.

24:29.604 --> 24:32.270
That's an incredible story,
Mr. Casey.

24:32.272 --> 24:34.973
<i>It certainly explains</i>
<i>why the CIA is after you.</i>

24:34.975 --> 24:36.375
However, there is the question

24:36.377 --> 24:38.309
of the man you met with
earlier today.

24:38.311 --> 24:42.981
That man went to a great deal
of trouble to meet with you.

24:42.983 --> 24:45.617
We have no idea who he is
or who he works for.

24:45.619 --> 24:48.052
But I think it's safe to say
that the secret work you did

24:48.054 --> 24:51.789
for the government
is no longer secret.

25:06.638 --> 25:09.172
(Greer) [British accent]
Good evening, Mr. Lambert.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.810
Understand you had difficulty
in acquiring our prize.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.578
[British accent]
CIA acted more aggressively

25:14.580 --> 25:16.046
than we anticipated.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.616
I tried to render Casey
in broad daylight.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.617
Is he in their custody now?

25:20.619 --> 25:21.918
Someone pulled him
out of there.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.788
Private detail,
watching his back.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.524
CIA did, however, capture
one of our operatives.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.359
They're no doubt pressing
him now as to who we are.

25:30.361 --> 25:32.361
I can divert resources
to recover him.

25:32.363 --> 25:35.998
Our people can take care
of themselves.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.434
Right now there's only one man
on the planet of any value,

25:38.436 --> 25:40.702
and that's Daniel Casey.

25:40.704 --> 25:43.172
Very well, sir.

25:43.174 --> 25:46.008
Oh, Mr. Lambert.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.044
Fail me again,
and I'll find someone

25:48.046 --> 25:50.813
more adequate for the task.

25:50.815 --> 25:53.515
Are we clear on this?

25:53.517 --> 25:55.684
We are, Mr. Greer.
Thank you.

26:25.317 --> 26:29.152
Hey, uh, w-w-what are you doing
with that?

26:29.154 --> 26:30.787
The fraction of code
that you captured here

26:30.789 --> 26:33.089
is not entirely
unfamiliar to me.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.424
I was going to try
to tweak it a bit.

26:35.426 --> 26:37.293
All right, well,
just be careful, okay?

26:37.295 --> 26:39.028
It's the only thing keeping
everyone from killing me.

26:39.030 --> 26:40.029
Besides you.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.631
You're right.

26:41.633 --> 26:43.833
In addition to the government
wanting you dead,

26:43.835 --> 26:46.536
there is also
a second interested party,

26:46.538 --> 26:48.838
about whom we know nothing.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.873
I've arranged for a sale
on the darknet.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.674
- You're gonna give it to them?
<i>- No.</i>

26:52.676 --> 26:54.377
I have a hunch
that the group's concern

26:54.379 --> 26:56.612
lies with the laptop
and not the man carrying it.

26:56.614 --> 26:58.214
If we sell it,
they might call off

26:58.216 --> 27:00.849
their pursuit of you
in favor of finding the code.

one group of psychos,

27:02.786 --> 27:04.620

- No, it doesn't.

Which is why my partner
is chartering a plane

27:06.824 --> 27:08.456
to fly you safely
out of the country.

27:08.458 --> 27:11.026
Yeah, I won't get too far
without a new identity.

27:11.028 --> 27:14.229
I had a buddy drawing up some
papers for me as a Hail Mary.

27:14.231 --> 27:17.065
Might be wise
to avoid known associates

27:17.067 --> 27:19.401
at this time,
if you can help it.

27:19.403 --> 27:20.869
And, in this case, you can.

27:20.871 --> 27:23.871
I... took the liberty

27:23.873 --> 27:26.541
<i>of creating</i>
<i>a new identity myself.</i>

of everything.

I mean, look, it's obvious.
This place, your setup.

27:40.356 --> 27:42.590
And I think you know
more about that code

27:42.592 --> 27:45.593
than you're willing to admit.

27:47.930 --> 27:50.264
I know that anyone that
has contact with this system

27:50.266 --> 27:52.767

28:06.282 --> 28:07.647
No, you don't.
