WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:05.270
93.3, WMMR.

00:05.338 --> 00:09.434
Back with the Preston and Steve Show. Listen
up. We've got to open up the phone lines.

00:09.509 --> 00:14.105
The first listener who can correctly answer
our stupid trivia question of the day...

00:14.180 --> 00:16.808
is gonna get to come down to
the Flyers game with us tomorrow night...

00:16.883 --> 00:18.874
and take a shot from center ice.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.853
If you make it,
you win two V.I.P. passes...

00:21.921 --> 00:25.413
to the 93. 3 WMMR Beach House
for our Start of Summer Blowout!

00:25.492 --> 00:28.427
Who would want to spend a weekend
at a beach house with these idiots?

00:28.495 --> 00:31.430
- Nothing but busy signals.
- I'm on hold on all of 'em. We're gonna get through.

00:31.498 --> 00:33.659
You're on hold on those?

00:33.733 --> 00:36.759
- Hey, who's on the line?
- Uh, uh, Mac from South Philly!

00:36.836 --> 00:40.033
All right, Mac from South Philly,
you're on with Preston and Steve!

00:40.106 --> 00:42.370
- Holy shit! He got on!
- Holy shit! I got on!

00:42.442 --> 00:45.138
Please don't curse.
All right, here's the question.

00:45.211 --> 00:50.046
What Philadelphia Flyer holds the
franchise record for goals in a season?

00:50.116 --> 00:51.913
You have 30 seconds. Go!

00:51.985 --> 00:53.543
- It's a hockey question!
- Go, go! Hockey, hockey!

00:53.620 --> 00:55.747
Where's the "H" key?
There's no "H" key!

00:55.822 --> 00:59.121
- What are you talking about?
- Is there another way to spell "hockey"?

00:59.192 --> 01:01.626
- There's no "H" key!
- There's an "H" right there!

01:01.694 --> 01:04.629
Why did I put you in charge of this job?
Forget this. I got this.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.528
Think, Mac.
Think. Think. Think.

01:06.599 --> 01:09.534
- I gotta think like that guy that sits on the rock.
- This dude? The one like that?

01:09.602 --> 01:11.832
- Yeah, with the big muscles. He puts his
hand on his... He's big, green and gets angry?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.600
- The Thinker?
- The Thinker.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.334
Oh, the Hulk!
The Incredible Hulk!

01:15.408 --> 01:17.467
Hulk doesn't think at all!
Shit, I know this.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.478
Dude, you gotta stop cursing.

01:19.546 --> 01:22.014
You guys can't censor me.
I'm a bit of a badass.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.017
All right, let's go!
Answer the question! Come on!

01:25.085 --> 01:28.521
I don't know. I don't know it.
Damn it! Reggie Leach.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.954
Reggie Leach is the...

01:31.024 --> 01:32.958
correct answer!

01:33.026 --> 01:34.823
Wow!

02:10.630 --> 02:12.723
Center ice shot, baby!

02:12.799 --> 02:14.266
# We're goin' to the beach house #

02:14.334 --> 02:15.767
# Gonna make our dreams come true #

02:15.835 --> 02:17.803
# Down at the beach house
is what we're gonna #

02:17.871 --> 02:20.305
- # Do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh #
- Yeah!

02:20.373 --> 02:22.534
This is a potentially
life-changing opportunity.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.043
Not potentially. It is
a life-changing opportunity. It is!

02:25.111 --> 02:29.275
Sorry. How is spending a weekend at a radio
show beach house a life-changing opportunity?

02:29.349 --> 02:32.512
Dude, there is gonna be so many athletes
and celebrities at that beach house.

02:32.585 --> 02:35.281
This is my chance to finally sow
myself into the inner circle.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.915
I'm gonna be like
a local sports legend.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.585
- Hey, can we have our phones back?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.220
Why don't you get on 'em about using
the minutes on the cell phones?

02:43.296 --> 02:45.230
They used up
all your minutes. Right?

02:45.298 --> 02:47.232
Frank, nobody gives a shit
about minutes anymore.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.632
Actually, you know what?
I do give a shit about minutes.

02:49.702 --> 02:52.466
I know I shouldn't and I'm just probably buying
into the phone company's propaganda.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.302
- But there you go.
- Interesting.

02:54.374 --> 02:57.639
- What is happening here? Why are you taping them?
- Because they got great banter.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.974
They jib-jab.
Jib-jab, jib-jab, jib-jab.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.276
I use it for the car
because my stereo's busted.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.407
We have a lot of interesting
things to say, so -

03:04.484 --> 03:07.112
Oh, shit, I feel like the conversation
we've been having the last five minutes...

03:07.187 --> 03:09.712
is a lot more interesting than the shit
they're talking about on the radio.

03:09.789 --> 03:14.624
You kidding? Moronic commentary, stupid sound
effects. It's dumb. It doesn't make any sense.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.321
We have voices.
We talk about the issues.

03:16.396 --> 03:19.229
I feel like we could do a podcast
and it would be a million times better...

03:19.299 --> 03:22.063
- Than whatever that drivel was we were listening to.
- Without a doubt.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.899
- You know what? This sounds like jealousy talk.
- Yeah.

03:24.971 --> 03:27.906
"Mac, Charlie, congratulations on your
slap shot and the beach house. Okay?

03:27.974 --> 03:29.908
Uh, we're happy for you."

03:29.976 --> 03:32.911
- You're sad sometimes. You're dark souls.
- Why aren't you happy for us?

03:32.979 --> 03:34.708
- You wanna just do our thing and let -
- Let's do our thing.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.409
Have fun with your important conversations
and your big issues...

03:37.483 --> 03:39.747
with your brains
and your smart stuff, okay?

03:39.819 --> 03:41.753
- We got hockey to learn!
- And we're gonna -

03:41.821 --> 03:44.187
- And it's gonna change our lives.
- Life-changing!

03:44.257 --> 03:47.249
- Okay. It was The Thinker. It's The Thinker.
- You couldn't spell hockey.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.761
Oh! Zing! Boom-boom!

03:49.829 --> 03:51.820
Hold on a second.
You guys are the best.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.958
Do not speak
until I turn my tape over.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.467
Okay.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.470
Oh, shit!

03:58.538 --> 04:01.530
I taped over
my Luther Vandross mix!

04:01.608 --> 04:03.337
Ahh!

04:07.247 --> 04:09.715
Okay, dude,
now we're both in agreement.

04:09.782 --> 04:12.717
This is probably the biggest opportunity
either of us have ever had in our lives, right?

04:12.785 --> 04:15.117
We are not men who get
a lot of opportunities, Charlie.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.281
- The few we've had, we've squandered.
- We've squandered 'em all.

04:17.357 --> 04:20.690
That's why we gotta stay focused, Mac.
I mean, this is pro sports!

04:20.760 --> 04:23.320
- We gotta do this right. You gotta look good.
- Yeah.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.988
And you can't
miss that shot, right?

04:25.064 --> 04:27.396
- I really appreciate you helping me, dude.
- Absolutely.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.458
- A little pee-wee hockey experience never hurts.
- You're good.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.696
Okay, so first things first.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.705
- Hold the hockey stick.
- Hold the hockey stick.

04:33.773 --> 04:37.834
- Mm-hmm. - Okay, good. 'Cause I was thinking
I'd have a position sort of like this.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.879
Why would you do that?

04:40.947 --> 04:43.313
All of my instincts and my training
tell me to use this as a weapon.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.317
All of your instincts
and your training are wrong.

04:45.385 --> 04:47.649
Hold it like a hockey stick
or people are going to boo you.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.654
- The Philly fans are brutal, dude.
- All right, fine!

04:49.722 --> 04:53.214
All right? Right. Then you just
sort of haunch down a little bit.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.920
- Okay? Can you -
- Done.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.224
You might wanna hau -
You look stiff like a -

04:57.297 --> 05:00.232
You look like a G. I. Joe action figure.
Loosen up. And haunch.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.928
- What if I do this?
- That's way stiffer!

05:03.002 --> 05:05.664
- That's pretty good right there, Charlie.
- You look so awkward.

05:05.738 --> 05:09.230
Bro, when you tack on mass you sacrifice
flexibility. That's just a straight-up fact!

05:09.309 --> 05:10.503
That's insane!
Touch your toes!

05:10.576 --> 05:12.271
What am I, a gymnast?

05:12.345 --> 05:15.678
- Teach me how to shoot the shot!
- All right, fine, fine. Calm down. All right.

05:15.748 --> 05:20.742
What you're gonna want to do is just gently -
gently sort of guide the puck at the net...

05:20.820 --> 05:23.755
like, you know, like a tiny bowl of cream
you don't want to spill...

05:23.823 --> 05:25.347
and you're guiding it.

05:25.425 --> 05:26.824
I'm not gonna do that.

05:26.893 --> 05:29.589
I'm gonna go out there and take
a wicked slap shot. You know?

05:29.662 --> 05:32.290
Really make a name for myself. Otherwise
I go out there, I look like a jabroni.

05:32.365 --> 05:36.199
You know what? Yeah. We might wanna
work on some kind of routine, huh?

05:36.269 --> 05:39.295
Thank you. Exactly. So I'll go out there,
I showcase my weaponry -

05:39.372 --> 05:42.068
Uh-huh.
Pump the crowd up.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.804
- Really get the crowd up and raise the roof. Huh?
- Okay.

05:45.878 --> 05:49.279
But you can't take a slap shot before you even
know how to handle a stick and a puck.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.409
So will you just glide one?
Just to get the form.

05:52.485 --> 05:55.784
And then we'll get bigger and bigger
and eventually slap shots.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.050
But it starts with
gliding like cream. Go!

05:58.124 --> 06:02.151
- Gliding like a jabroni is what I'm gonna be doing.
- Jabroni. Okay, go.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.630
- Well, that didn't do anything.
- That was pretty pathetic. You're right.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.261
The problem is, I'm out in the elements, dude.
There's so much wind and sun.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.397
- And this asphalt- That's not regulation.
- No, it's not regulation -

06:14.474 --> 06:16.942
- So it's not gonna slide.
- All right, you know what? You wanna do this the right way?

06:17.009 --> 06:18.340
- Yeah.
- Let's go to the ice.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.572
Let's get some pucks.
All right?

06:20.646 --> 06:24.412
We'll slide, we'll take a few slap shots.
We'll do this the right way.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.475
- Let's go to the ice.
- Let's go to the ice.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.518
All right, very exciting stuff.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.523
We're pretty much
ready to go with this podcast.

06:31.591 --> 06:35.357
What the hell is a podcast? Why don't
you just tape it? What are you doing?

06:35.428 --> 06:39.057
You don't have to tape it these days, Frank.
You just record it right onto the computer.

06:39.132 --> 06:42.067
And once we start recording, Frank, I'm gonna
need you to stop eating those crackers.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.296
It's incredibly annoying,
and it's all anyone's gonna be able to hear.

06:44.370 --> 06:47.100
So, Dennis and Dee Reynolds here.

06:47.173 --> 06:51.439
Inaugural podcast.
We're talking technology today. The big "T."

06:51.511 --> 06:55.447
Absolutely. Everyone's talking about technology
these days because it's everywhere.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.450
- Oh, it is- You can't escape it.
- You absolutely can't.

06:58.518 --> 07:02.648
So, Dee, tell us what you feel about technology.
What's your opinion on it?

07:03.956 --> 07:06.117
My opinion?

07:14.801 --> 07:16.701
Dead air!

07:16.769 --> 07:19.397
- Could you ease up on the crackers?
- I'm gettin' bored with this!

07:19.472 --> 07:21.406
- I'm gonna bring my guest in.
- Guest?

07:21.474 --> 07:23.908
- I asked Cricket to come. Cricket. He's outside.
- Cricket? No!

07:23.976 --> 07:27.844
You can't bring guests in here! This is our
podcast! I feel like you're trying to take over!

07:27.914 --> 07:30.382
No, you know what? Actually this
could bring up a pretty good issue.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.850
If you bring Cricket in here we could
rail on him about the homeless issue.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.682
- Cricket!
- Cricks.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.688
- Yo.
- Come on in, buddy. We're ready for ya.

07:36.756 --> 07:38.781
Hey, Frank, where's my chicken?

07:38.858 --> 07:40.519
This is taking forever.
Come on.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.857
- I promised him a rotisserie chicken.
- Let's go. Chop-chop.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.227
- I'm starving here.
- What's going on with your voice?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.232
It's from when Frank hit me
with the trash can.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.427
- Wound got infected. It was a whole ordeal.
- Ugh!

07:49.502 --> 07:52.266
Okay, all right, well, uh, listen,
let's get into the issues here.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.272
We're gonna start rolling
on this, Cricket.

07:54.340 --> 07:59.073
Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not saying
another word until I get the chicken.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.409
- I lied about the chicken, Crick.
- Are you kidding me?

08:01.481 --> 08:04.780
- It was bullshit.
- Oh, my God. Unbelievable. Why do I even trust you?

08:04.851 --> 08:08.116
All right, wait a minute.
Here. I do have something for you.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.052
- Lemons.
- Lemons?

08:10.122 --> 08:13.057
- Yeah. You suck on 'em.
- Oh, come on. At least give me the crackers.

08:13.125 --> 08:16.060
- No, suck on a lemon. Here. Go ahead.
- Well, they are good for scurvy.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.892
- I'll have a few lemons. But then I'm out of here.
- All right, here we go.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.832
So, uh, Dennis
and Dee Reynolds here.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.529
We are talking about
the homeless issue here in Philly.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.765
That's a big issue these days,
and we're here with our friend Cricket.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.969
He is a homeless man.
Cricket, walk us through a day in your life.

08:31.043 --> 08:33.169
Oh, a day in the life.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.339
Well, uh, the other morning...

08:35.414 --> 08:38.871
I wake up, I find a dog
sniffin' at my wound.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.748
- Mmm.
- He's fully aroused, mind you.

08:40.820 --> 08:44.187
So I'm thinking, "Oh, great.
What does this jerk want?"

08:44.256 --> 08:46.885
Course I know what he wants.
He's lookin' at me right in the eyes.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.189
He does not have to say it.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.662
Not that he could.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.729
Oh, that is- that is tart!

08:55.801 --> 08:57.234
That is really tart.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.404
I mean, does my scar...

08:59.472 --> 09:01.372
look like a dog's vagina?

09:01.440 --> 09:05.740
You know? Maybe. I don't know. I'm not gonna
sit here and try to get inside the mind of a dog.

09:05.811 --> 09:07.506
I mean, that's God's work.

09:07.580 --> 09:11.482
Well, not that I believe in God. I don't.
Not since that Chinaman stole my kidney.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.748
- Cricket, tell Dee how much you think she's ugly.
- That's not gonna make sense.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.015
He doesn't think I'm ugly.
He's madly in love with me.

09:17.089 --> 09:19.455
- Don't flatter yourself. I'm over you, sister.
- Since when?

09:19.525 --> 09:21.584
Since I found out
you are a whore.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.754
- Will you stop talking about
this! This has nothing to do... Ohh!

09:23.829 --> 09:26.127
Well, maybe you're a whore,
you stupid, ugly, homeless bitch!

09:26.198 --> 09:28.063
- Zing!
- A dog banged your neck the other day!

09:28.134 --> 09:29.761
- You're both whores!
- This is great radio!

09:29.835 --> 09:32.303
At least someone's banging my vagina!

09:32.371 --> 09:33.963
Get into it!
Get into it!

09:34.040 --> 09:36.600
This is not good radio!

09:38.244 --> 09:40.439
All right.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.141
Okay, this is exciting, Mac!
This is exciting!

09:43.215 --> 09:45.149
- You know? You're- What are you doing?
- Huh?

09:45.217 --> 09:47.151
- Will you take this seriously?
- I am taking it seriously.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.846
This is your big moment, man.

09:48.921 --> 09:54.291
You gotta walk out to center ice
and you gotta be like, "Hey! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"

09:54.360 --> 09:57.659
- U.S.A!
- Not like that. Make it classy.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.823
Okay, but keep in mind
I am gonna be wearing the duster.

09:59.899 --> 10:02.026
Of course you're gonna wear the duster.
That's gonna look awesome.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.797
- Thanks.
- Yeah. You should probably also be wearing a wig.

10:04.870 --> 10:08.067
- A wig?
- Totally. Long, flowing hair.

10:08.140 --> 10:11.837
That's gonna look way more dramatic.
You know what I mean?

10:11.911 --> 10:13.845
Okay, I like the wig idea in spirit.

10:13.913 --> 10:17.474
The problem is, I'll have to wear the wig to
the beach house so people will recognize me.

10:17.550 --> 10:20.678
Next thing you know, I'm wearing a wig for the
rest of my life just to keep up appearances.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.243
Yeah, like Andre Agassi, huh?

10:22.321 --> 10:24.255
Yeah. Right.
I don't wanna do that.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.052
I don't know.
Let's not rule it out.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.753
A good hockey wig could
put this thing over the top, man.

10:28.828 --> 10:31.820
- Okay, fine. Let's do this! Come on, dude!
- Let's do this thing!

10:31.897 --> 10:35.060
- We'll take some shots.
- What else are we here for, dude? Let's do some shots!

10:35.134 --> 10:37.398
- All right, you ready?
- Let's see what you got.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.869
Haunch.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.274
What was that?

10:43.342 --> 10:45.435
All right, well, that would have been cool
if I was standing backwards.

10:45.511 --> 10:48.503
You're not gonna stand backward.
You're gonna stand forward. You're gonna -

10:48.581 --> 10:50.674
What the hell are you two
doing out here?

10:50.750 --> 10:52.718
- Don't worry about it, bro.
- We're prac -

10:52.785 --> 10:54.719
You can't be out here
swinging hockey sticks.

10:54.787 --> 10:57.722
You're not even supposed to
be out here without skates. Now get out!

10:57.790 --> 10:58.916
- All right -
- Out!

10:58.991 --> 11:00.982
Okay! We're leavin'.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.523
You know what, Charlie?

11:03.596 --> 11:05.086
I think he's right, dude.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.792
Only a couple of jabronis
come out here without skates on.

11:07.867 --> 11:11.462
I gotta do this thing in skates. You know,
work up a routine, really jazz the crowd.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.471
- Can I stop you though?
- Yeah.

11:13.539 --> 11:15.666
You keep using this word "jabroni."

11:15.741 --> 11:18.335
And... it's awesome!

11:18.411 --> 11:21.642
- It's like the coolest word I- Is that
a hockey thing? - Yeah- N- I don't know.

11:21.714 --> 11:24.649
- I think it's some dago word, but it
sounds like a hockey word. - It does -

11:24.717 --> 11:26.582
You're gonna want to brush up
on your hockey words.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.586
At the beach house you're gonna be
hanging out with the Flyers.

11:31.955 --> 11:33.752
Okay, we are back.

11:33.824 --> 11:36.759
Dennis and Dee Reynolds here.
We're back to the podcast.

11:36.827 --> 11:38.454
- We got a little derailed earlier.
- We did.

11:38.528 --> 11:40.894
We did. But that's okay.
We're gonna get back on track here.

11:40.964 --> 11:44.297
- I got a hot topic that I wanna talk about, Dee.
- Tell me what it is.

11:44.368 --> 11:47.303
This is something I'm pretty charged up
about. It's stem cell research.

11:47.371 --> 11:50.101
- Good one. Excellent one.
- It's a very divisive issue these days.

11:50.173 --> 11:52.835
- People are really going to town, one side against the other.
- Oh, absolutely.

11:52.909 --> 11:55.241
- Some people are for it,
some people are against it -

11:55.312 --> 11:59.112
- What is that? What are you doing?
- That was a duck.

11:59.182 --> 12:02.345
- Why would you make a duck noise right in the middle of my thing?
- It was funny.

12:02.419 --> 12:05.911
- Yeah, but you derailed us.
- I thought I'd up the production value, add some sound effects.

12:05.989 --> 12:07.479
- Well, don't.
- Okay, well -

12:07.557 --> 12:09.457
So, stem cell research- Stop.

12:09.526 --> 12:11.960
- Stem cell research is a very -
Why are you still pu -

12:12.029 --> 12:15.692
- Stop pushing sound effects.
I want to talk about ser -

12:15.766 --> 12:17.791
- Which one is that one?
- This one.

12:17.868 --> 12:20.598
That's a laser beam.

12:20.671 --> 12:22.764
Yeah.

12:22.839 --> 12:25.967
- I like that one. I wanna pepper that one in.
- Okay.

12:26.043 --> 12:28.341
- Don't do it while I'm talking.
- All right, well, we'll see.

12:28.412 --> 12:29.970
- Hello.
- Hey! Frank!

12:30.047 --> 12:33.016
- That's Frank Reynolds, everybody!
- I have a great topic for you.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.607
- War.
- War!

12:34.685 --> 12:36.380
- War? Good one!
- Yeah.

12:36.453 --> 12:38.387
Yeah! Everyone's
talking about the war.

12:38.455 --> 12:41.049
And I have the perfect guest.

12:41.124 --> 12:42.557
- Huh.
- Okay. All right.

12:42.626 --> 12:45.026
- Ben the soldier.
- Hey, Dee. Good to see you.

12:45.095 --> 12:47.359
What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
I'm not comfortable with this.

12:47.431 --> 12:50.127
Okay, Ben is a soldier.
He's in the war- probably.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.328
Not now, obviously, unless the war is
happening here. Is the war happening here?

12:53.403 --> 12:55.303
I don't know!
Let's get into all this stuff.

12:55.372 --> 12:58.034
Ben the soldier is here with us, folks,
and I want to talk to him...

12:58.108 --> 12:59.905
because, Ben, it's my understanding...

12:59.976 --> 13:02.376
that there is a war
going on right now.

13:02.446 --> 13:03.970
Am I -
Am I right in this?

13:04.047 --> 13:06.538
Well, actually
there are two wars right now.

13:06.616 --> 13:08.049
- Two war -
- You don't say.

13:08.118 --> 13:10.245
- We're in the midst of two wars?
- Huh!

13:10.320 --> 13:14.654
Now, the United States of America
is engaged in both of these wars?

13:14.725 --> 13:16.124
Yes.
Yes, they are.

13:16.193 --> 13:19.993
And, uh, are either of these wars
happening on U.S., uh, soil?

13:20.063 --> 13:22.054
Excuse me.
Let me- Let me -

13:22.132 --> 13:24.066
- What is your job in the war?
- Let me just -

13:24.134 --> 13:27.433
- Are you a carrier of- of, uh, large weaponry?
- Let me just interr -

13:27.504 --> 13:31.600
How 'bout if we talk about
how you used to bang each other?

13:31.675 --> 13:33.233
- Yeah -
- No -

13:33.310 --> 13:35.835
What kind of technique did you use?
Tie-ups and stuff like that.

13:35.912 --> 13:38.710
- Frank, it's not good radio.
- 'Cause people like sex.

13:38.782 --> 13:40.511
Okay, well, I just want to clarify.

13:40.584 --> 13:43.849
What my producer, Frank, is referring to
is the fact that Ben, our soldier here...

13:43.920 --> 13:46.252
and Dee used to be lovers.

13:46.323 --> 13:49.622
- Hey! That's a good one!
- Don't do that to me.

13:49.693 --> 13:51.524
That's not funny.

13:51.595 --> 13:55.292
- You're in the hot seat, girl.
- I'm not in the hot seat! Ben's in the hot seat!

13:57.300 --> 14:01.259
All right, Mac, so you're gonna come
on the ice and fire out to center. Right?

14:01.338 --> 14:03.772
Do, like, a cool turn,
get the crowd going!

14:03.840 --> 14:06.400
- Okay. So, fire out -
- C- Come on!

14:06.476 --> 14:08.034
- Huh?
- What are you d -

14:08.111 --> 14:10.739
- Huh?
- That's not cool! Wait.

14:10.814 --> 14:12.782
Do you not know
how to ice skate?

14:12.849 --> 14:15.875
No, not at all. But I figured you would
teach me, 'cause we got plenty of time.

14:15.952 --> 14:17.943
We don't have time!
It's tomorrow night, man!

14:18.021 --> 14:20.956
Charlie, you gotta help me, dude.
This is my big break. Come on!

14:21.024 --> 14:23.117
Oh, my God!

14:24.494 --> 14:26.462
All right, we got
a lot of work to do.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.828
All right, here.
Grab the stick.

14:28.899 --> 14:30.423
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.365
And we'll start slow.
Oh, my -

14:32.435 --> 14:34.995
- This is gonna take forever, man.
- That's good.

14:35.071 --> 14:38.632
That's good. That's good.
I'm skating.

14:58.428 --> 15:00.953
# Push it to the limit #

15:01.031 --> 15:02.191
# Limit #

15:02.265 --> 15:04.961
# Walk along the razor's edge #

15:05.035 --> 15:06.195
# But don't look down #

15:06.269 --> 15:08.965
# Just keep your head
or you'll be finished #

15:13.443 --> 15:15.536
# Open up the limit #

15:15.612 --> 15:17.307
# Limit #

15:17.380 --> 15:19.871
# Past the point of no return #

15:19.950 --> 15:20.882
# You've reached the top #

15:20.951 --> 15:23.044
# But still you gotta learn #

15:23.119 --> 15:24.814
- # How to keep it #
- Charlie, don't! Don't! Don't!

15:29.059 --> 15:32.051
# Hit the wheel
and double the stakes #

15:32.128 --> 15:34.722
# Throttle wide open
like a bat out of hell #

15:34.798 --> 15:36.390
# You crash the gates #

15:37.868 --> 15:40.598
# Crash the gates #

15:40.670 --> 15:43.366
# Going for the back of beyond #

15:43.440 --> 15:45.806
# Nothin 'gonna stop you
There's nothin' that strong #

15:45.876 --> 15:47.571
Send it on in!

15:47.644 --> 15:49.544
Whoo-hoo!

15:49.613 --> 15:51.342
# So push it #

15:51.414 --> 15:53.006
# Ooh, yeah #

15:53.083 --> 15:57.645
# The limit, the limit, the limit, the limit #

15:57.721 --> 16:01.384
- # Push it to the limit #
- # The limit, the limit, the limit, the limit #

16:01.458 --> 16:03.358
Okay, next guest!

16:03.426 --> 16:05.360
All right, Dennis,
let's get this over with.

16:05.428 --> 16:07.794
Don't bring her in here
stinkin' up the joint. Come on.

16:07.864 --> 16:09.798
Frank said you were gonna apologize to me.

16:09.866 --> 16:12.130
Oh!
Who's in the hot seat now?

16:14.204 --> 16:17.367
- Let's not push too many of those.
You're abusing it.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.465
- It's gonna get not funny after a little while.
- No, no, that's good.

16:19.542 --> 16:22.670
So let me understand this, waitress.

16:22.746 --> 16:27.376
Uh, Frank promised you an apology from me.
You didn't believe him, did you?

16:27.450 --> 16:29.748
- Come on.
- Yeah.

16:29.819 --> 16:32.447
Really? Well, that makes you
incredibly gullible and stupid.

16:32.522 --> 16:34.547
Oh! Oh, oh!
Don't take that from him.

16:34.624 --> 16:38.151
- Are you gonna take that from him?
Stand up for yourself!

16:38.228 --> 16:40.423
I'm not leaving here
until you apologize to me.

16:40.497 --> 16:42.431
Yeah? Well, you're gonna be here for a while.

16:42.499 --> 16:43.796
She's boring me.

16:43.867 --> 16:46.461
I'll give you 50 bucks
if you take off your top...

16:46.536 --> 16:48.800
and you drink soup
out of my shoe.

16:48.872 --> 16:50.464
- What?
- Okay, now that I'd like to see.

16:50.540 --> 16:53.373
Yeah, yeah, me too. What do you say,
sister? You need some extra cash?

16:53.443 --> 16:55.468
- No.
- 500 bucks.

16:55.545 --> 16:57.536
Cricket, bring her some soup.

16:57.614 --> 17:00.276
You're gonna pay me $500
to drink soup out of a shoe.

17:00.350 --> 17:01.578
And take your top off.

17:07.589 --> 17:09.057
Fine.

17:09.125 --> 17:10.490
- Oh!
- I'll do it.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.324
- Nice!
- But I am not taking my top off.

17:13.396 --> 17:15.489
- Well, that's a relief to all of us.
- Ooh!

17:15.565 --> 17:16.623
- Zing!
- Zinged her!

17:16.700 --> 17:18.098
Gotcha!

17:18.167 --> 17:20.568
Couldn't find soup,
but I found some dirty dishwater.

17:20.637 --> 17:22.605
- Boom! Even better!
- I am not drinking dishwater.

17:22.672 --> 17:24.401
- Oh, come on.
- Dump it on her head.

17:24.473 --> 17:25.736
- What?
- Yes!

17:27.444 --> 17:29.207
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

17:29.279 --> 17:32.009
Hold it- Ugh!

17:32.082 --> 17:35.677
Oh, now this is good radio!

17:41.992 --> 17:45.189
Holy shit, dude. There's a lot of people here.
I'm getting nervous, Charlie.

17:45.261 --> 17:49.493
Yeah, you might throw up when you get
out there, you know, from the nerves.

17:49.566 --> 17:52.057
You're supposed to be my coach, dude.
Don't tell me I'm gonna throw up!

17:52.135 --> 17:55.195
- I know, but people do that, so try not to throw up.
- Oh, come on, dude.

17:55.271 --> 17:58.172
- Mac! Charlie! What's up, man?
- You guys came to support me!

17:58.241 --> 18:00.732
- Uh, yeah! Yeah!
- Oh- Yeah, that was -

18:00.810 --> 18:02.675
- Yeah, yeah, that's why we're here.
- Primarily, yeah.

18:02.746 --> 18:04.304
But also, since we're here...

18:04.381 --> 18:06.679
we wanted to give you this tape
so you could give it to those radio guys.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.980
That's our demo tape. We were recording
the whole thing on a computer.

18:09.052 --> 18:11.316
But then the computer got water
dumped all over it. It was a whole thing.

18:11.388 --> 18:13.788
- "Luther Vandross"?
- Is that still on there?

18:13.857 --> 18:16.451
- Oh, that's very off-putting, Dennis.
- We should have relabeled it.

18:16.526 --> 18:18.858
- It's not Luther Vandross.
- Make sure you tell 'em it's not Luther Vandross.

18:18.928 --> 18:23.058
Let's get going!
Mac from South Philly, get out here!

18:25.568 --> 18:27.763
- This is you!
- Oh! Here we go. Here we go.

18:27.837 --> 18:29.566
Everybody say a prayer.

18:32.842 --> 18:34.366
Let's do this.

18:35.445 --> 18:37.208
Give 'em the tape.

18:58.935 --> 19:02.200
- What is that?
- The future of radio, you jabronis.

19:02.939 --> 19:05.032
"Jabronis."
Cool word.

19:27.897 --> 19:29.592
Score!

19:29.666 --> 19:31.133
He did it!

19:31.201 --> 19:33.692
Mac from South Philly
has cemented himself...

19:33.770 --> 19:36.068
as a Philly sports legend!

19:36.139 --> 19:37.697
Let's hear it for Mac!

19:37.774 --> 19:44.142
Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!

19:44.214 --> 19:49.811
Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!
Mac! Mac! Mac!

19:49.886 --> 19:52.480
Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!

19:52.555 --> 19:56.252
Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac!

19:56.326 --> 19:58.226
Wake up! Mac!

19:58.294 --> 20:00.319
Mac! Mac! Wake up!

20:00.396 --> 20:02.421
Mac, wake up!

20:02.499 --> 20:05.297
What happened?
Did I do good, Charlie?

20:05.368 --> 20:08.166
No. You fell on your face
