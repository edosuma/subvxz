01:04:13.434 --> 01:04:17.035
You know what? Call Derrick and tell
him we're calling the whole thing off.

01:04:17.037 --> 01:04:19.303
- No.
- Sweetie, the death threat's off.

01:04:19.305 --> 01:04:20.372
Whatever.

01:04:20.374 --> 01:04:22.340
You cannot
call this thing off.

01:04:22.342 --> 01:04:25.309
This baby has moving parts. Balls
are already being played with.

01:04:25.311 --> 01:04:29.314
That's too bad. All they had to do
was mail fucking letters, Shawn.

01:04:29.316 --> 01:04:32.117
These are not the guys you
wanna double-cross. Trust me.

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:35.686
That's your problem. Get me my thousand
bucks back. They didn't do anything.

01:04:35.688 --> 01:04:38.689
Your thousand bucks?
Jeff, come on.

01:04:38.691 --> 01:04:42.693
Are... Tonya. You still
want this to happen, right?

01:04:42.695 --> 01:04:46.097
- I can still make this happen.
- I really don't care, Shawn.

01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:48.268
I clearly have
bigger shit to fry.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.471
You eat shit?

01:04:52.206 --> 01:04:55.173
- What?
- "Fish to fry," not "shit to fry."

01:04:55.175 --> 01:04:58.610
"Shit to fry" is a meal
best served never.

01:04:58.612 --> 01:05:01.613
Who cares, you big, fat fuck?
You can't make it happen anyway.

01:05:01.615 --> 01:05:04.483
- I'm on your side, Tonya.
- You're not a secret agent.

01:05:04.485 --> 01:05:05.751
You're not a hit man.

01:05:05.753 --> 01:05:09.421
You're just
a fat, nobody gasbag,

01:05:09.423 --> 01:05:13.392
who still lives with his parents
and drives a '76 Mercury,

01:05:13.394 --> 01:05:16.628
gets laughed at behind his
back, and has never been laid.

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:19.398
Just stay away from me!

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.700
- January 6.
- I had a session later that night so...

01:05:22.702 --> 01:05:24.572
- I was sleeping, yeah.
- I was asleep.

01:05:34.581 --> 01:05:37.849
Remember, if your mind is blank,
no one can pick up your vibes.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:41.188
Also, they can't identify you
if they don't see your eyes.

01:05:42.456 --> 01:05:43.456
Go.

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:04.344
Mind's blank.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.214
Don't let them see my eyes.

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:24.530
The john?

01:06:50.523 --> 01:06:53.694
Hey. Hey.
Which one's Kerrigan?

Go! Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

01:08:13.274 --> 01:08:16.875
I mean, we had no idea that
something like this could be done

01:08:16.877 --> 01:08:18.943
by two of the biggest boobs,

01:08:18.944 --> 01:08:23.682

01:08:42.935 --> 01:08:45.871
<i>Some guy just fucking broke

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:49.674
No, no, no, no, no! It was
supposed to be uh, just letters...

01:08:49.676 --> 01:08:52.310
It's not a fucking letter, Jeff!
They broke her fucking knee!

01:08:52.313 --> 01:08:54.946
It was supposed to be letters,
like a death threat!

01:08:54.948 --> 01:08:58.683
<i>Jeff, I'm telling you, forget the death
threat. Some guy broke her knee!</i>

- Jeff.

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:37.022
We did it, man.
We're everywhere.

01:09:37.024 --> 01:09:39.758
It is so
friggin' awesome.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:42.993

- [breathing heavily] What?

01:09:42.996 --> 01:09:44.830
- What the fuck did you do?
- What did I...

01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:47.698
Changed the course of history,
if you've been watching.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.868
Are you insane? Nobody
was supposed to get hurt.

01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:53.839
It was supposed to be
psychological warfare. Right?

01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:56.441
What if the psychological
warfare didn't work?

01:09:56.443 --> 01:09:58.710
What if it didn't scare her?
Then what?

01:09:58.712 --> 01:10:00.946
You know, all of our hard work
would've been for nothing.

01:10:00.948 --> 01:10:04.448
What hard work? It was
mailing fucking letters!

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:07.853
I had to handle it though, Jeff. I had to
handle this and make sure it happened.

01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:10.121
Look, I'm Tonya's bodyguard,

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:14.759
and now all the other skaters, maybe more
athletes, are going to need a bodyguard.

01:10:14.761 --> 01:10:16.894
So the money's
gonna be flowing in,

01:10:16.896 --> 01:10:18.162
and we pocket that money,

01:10:18.164 --> 01:10:21.066

Dad, make sure it's a
blank tape this time.

01:10:27.608 --> 01:10:30.808
It was a simple plan, Shawn.
Why didn't you just stick to it?

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:32.878
- I did stick to the plan.
- This was not the plan.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.613
This was always the plan.
Do you hear me?

01:10:35.615 --> 01:10:38.549
A guy like me, you think
it's easy in my profession,

01:10:38.551 --> 01:10:41.488
having to think four
steps ahead of everyone?

01:10:43.623 --> 01:10:46.493
Or did you not realize
that I was the one who...

01:10:48.628 --> 01:10:51.565
I was the one who called
the death threat on Tonya.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.868
What?

01:10:55.802 --> 01:10:56.802
Two to the back.

01:10:59.105 --> 01:11:01.740
People don't take me
seriously, Jeff.

01:11:01.742 --> 01:11:04.910
But I'm in control
of the situations.

01:11:04.912 --> 01:11:06.514
I proved that today.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.580

This was not the...

01:11:09.582 --> 01:11:11.422
- You better think...
- This is out of control!

01:11:12.019 --> 01:11:14.052
Relax.

01:11:14.054 --> 01:11:16.955
Everything is great.
[exhales]

01:11:16.957 --> 01:11:20.157
Yes, my parents did tape over my
favorite episode of <i>Star Trek</i>

01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:21.660

01:11:21.662 --> 01:11:24.196

We gotta get those guys
out of Detroit, okay?

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:34.071
Shane and Derrick, they're just stuck
there. They don't have any money.

01:11:57.998 --> 01:12:00.564

Well, with Lillehammer
just six weeks away,

01:12:07.173 --> 01:12:09.006
now's her chance
to show the country

01:12:09.008 --> 01:12:12.646
that she deserves a spot
on the Olympic team.

01:12:14.847 --> 01:12:17.014
- [music playing]
- [male announcer] It'll be interesting to see

01:12:17.016 --> 01:12:20.251

conservatively or not.

Shane Stant was clueless,
completely.

01:13:26.052 --> 01:13:29.888
Before the attack, he waited outside
the arena in Massachusetts,

01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:31.892
where he thought
Nancy Kerrigan was training.

01:13:33.327 --> 01:13:37.228
Now, he moved his car
every 15 minutes

01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:39.700
to avoid suspicion.

01:13:41.267 --> 01:13:44.134
He did this for two days.

01:13:44.136 --> 01:13:46.806
That's when he found out that
Nancy was actually in Detroit.

Okay. 'Cause we have to be real

- We're with the FBI.

I mean, I was asleep,
and Jeff wasn't even here.

01:15:36.182 --> 01:15:39.317
I wasn't even here.
Uh, I was asleep too.

01:15:39.319 --> 01:15:42.487
In, um, Oregon at home,

01:15:42.489 --> 01:15:44.992
which is in Portland,
where I live.

01:15:45.992 --> 01:15:46.992
In Oregon.

01:15:48.994 --> 01:15:51.196

make of all this, Jeff?

We're actually heading
to the airport right now.

Oh, yeah. Thanks very much.
Yeah.

But, first,
who's Derrick?

01:16:14.354 --> 01:16:15.823

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:20.960

about going to the Olympics?

01:16:28.234 --> 01:16:31.001
I'm really happy, but it
won't be a true crown

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:34.505
until I get my chance
with Nancy at the Olympics.

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:36.508
Let me tell ya,
I'm gonna whip her butt.

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:39.177
- Did the FBI speak to you?
- Um...

01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:40.778
I mean, they talked
to everybody.

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:45.415

a thorough investigation

01:16:45.417 --> 01:16:48.288

who did it.

- We gotta fix this.
- Fix what?

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:09.139

Everything's fine.

01:17:09.141 --> 01:17:11.843

We outsmarted them.

You wanna tell me what happened, Shawn?
Who did you talk to?

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.487
Nobody.

01:17:22.489 --> 01:17:24.555

Well, if you don't tell me now,

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:27.457
then... then we're all

01:17:27.459 --> 01:17:29.093
I didn't talk to anybody.

01:17:29.095 --> 01:17:31.028
Somebody knows something when
they shouldn't know anything.

01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:34.232
- I never said anything.
- Then how come they know the name Derrick, Shawn?

01:17:34.234 --> 01:17:36.500
I don't know. How can
you even ask me that?

01:17:36.502 --> 01:17:39.336
I could withstand torture
and I would still never talk.

01:17:39.338 --> 01:17:40.504

to take her out.

01:17:45.945 --> 01:17:47.978

obtains press credentials

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:49.880

01:17:49.882 --> 01:17:51.381
That's what gets us
inside the ring.

01:17:51.383 --> 01:17:55.286

whacks Kerrigan three times

01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:58.923

- Miss Harding.

01:46:59.230 --> 01:47:02.197
It's like you're giving me a life sentence
if you do that. You can't do that.

01:47:02.199 --> 01:47:03.265
Miss Harding, that's enough.

01:47:03.267 --> 01:47:04.299
You can't...

01:47:04.301 --> 01:47:06.803
Please, because...

01:47:06.805 --> 01:47:09.805
Just send me to jail
and then I can still skate.

01:47:09.807 --> 01:47:12.075

- Just send me to jail and then I can skate.
