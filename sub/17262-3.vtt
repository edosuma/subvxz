00:00.001 --> 00:03.360
All families have
secrets and this is ours.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.242
You have to control it.

00:05.267 --> 00:08.336
- Your grandfather lost control and...
- And what?

00:08.361 --> 00:09.800
He was obsessed with the idea

00:09.840 --> 00:13.317
that he could move objects
through thought control.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.092
Looking back, the signs were all there.

00:17.116 --> 00:19.596
We just didn't see them, or
we didn't want to see them.

00:19.621 --> 00:22.342
You think we can do this
brother and sister thing?

00:22.367 --> 00:23.607
We have to.

00:23.741 --> 00:26.341
We were all set on a collision course.

00:26.381 --> 00:29.459
- We didn't see it coming.
- This can't happen. Ever.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.250
The thing about Azfal is he'll
chat up anything in a skirt.

00:32.296 --> 00:35.155
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- I did a wrong thing, a bad thing.

00:35.180 --> 00:36.726
- What kind of bad thing?
- I didn't mean to,

00:36.750 --> 00:38.607
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean to!

00:41.451 --> 00:43.231
I need you to believe me.

00:43.256 --> 00:45.708
- I can't be alone with it any more.
- All right, fine.

00:45.778 --> 00:46.778
Prove it.

00:54.130 --> 00:56.359
Now do you believe me?

01:03.448 --> 01:04.779
Just...

01:05.328 --> 01:06.920
just give me a minute, OK?

01:37.210 --> 01:39.210
Leave that!

01:39.970 --> 01:41.496
Leave that.

01:44.810 --> 01:47.371
I need time to process this. It's...

01:49.810 --> 01:52.262
a lot to calibrate.

01:55.210 --> 01:57.770
When you say you did
something bad, how bad?

01:58.067 --> 02:00.107
Like when you trashed your dad's house?

02:02.330 --> 02:05.730
If I'm to help you, I need
you to be honest with me,

02:05.770 --> 02:07.490
and that means 100%.

02:07.530 --> 02:09.930
I need to know when this
happens, how it happens

02:09.970 --> 02:12.515
and under what circumstances.

02:12.937 --> 02:14.445
We need to involve your father now.

02:14.478 --> 02:16.187
- He has a right to know.
- No!

02:16.770 --> 02:18.810
You promised.

02:20.210 --> 02:23.130
Call me in the morning. We'll
work out how to move forward.

02:27.970 --> 02:30.246
Erm, you said your...

02:30.902 --> 02:33.003
your grandfather had it, too.

02:33.337 --> 02:35.225
What's the story there?

02:36.290 --> 02:37.944
It killed him.

02:46.290 --> 02:48.290
Jesus Christ!

02:59.125 --> 03:02.149
Remember what I said
about seeing is believing?

03:02.914 --> 03:06.045
But what if believing what you see

03:06.070 --> 03:08.010
means doubting every concept,

03:08.050 --> 03:10.930
every principle your life is based on?

03:11.810 --> 03:14.330
And once you let doubt like that in,

03:14.370 --> 03:17.988
what unknown hell will it lead you to?

03:37.973 --> 03:39.973
- Yes?
- Is he with you?

03:39.998 --> 03:42.410
- No.
- Have you tried calling him?

03:42.669 --> 03:44.669
Obviously I did.

03:45.730 --> 03:49.162
He's... he's probably
staying over with a mate.

03:49.482 --> 03:51.865
I'm sorry to disturb you. Sorry.

04:00.690 --> 04:02.287
Who was that?

04:02.410 --> 04:04.410
Work.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.530
Just through here.

05:25.443 --> 05:26.906
What's the deal with him?

05:28.770 --> 05:31.732
A sub-something haemorrhage, they said.

05:32.270 --> 05:35.807
They won't know until he comes
around whether there's brain damage.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.378
If so, how much.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.130
You were there when he had the accident.

05:46.570 --> 05:48.276
I saw you.

05:48.534 --> 05:50.610
So much for being in the library.

05:52.370 --> 05:55.010
Is that why you didn't
stick around to help?

05:57.050 --> 06:00.011
- He's your frien...
- Well, I'm here now, aren't I?!

06:01.970 --> 06:04.051
You're not who I thought you were.

06:04.703 --> 06:06.603
Not even close.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.930
And that thing you said...

06:09.970 --> 06:11.971
about doing the bad stuff...

06:13.760 --> 06:17.010
put "selfish arsehole"
on top of the list.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.970
Never use it in anger.

07:32.923 --> 07:34.810
Only use it for good.

07:35.490 --> 07:37.130
Only for good.

09:25.010 --> 09:27.370
Oh, my God...

09:38.693 --> 09:40.464
What sort of tests of these, anyway?

09:40.498 --> 09:42.658
She didn't go into details.

09:42.698 --> 09:45.258
Any time you're not
comfortable, if you want to bail,

09:45.298 --> 09:46.434
we're out of there.

09:46.459 --> 09:49.505
We have to start somewhere to
get the answers that you need.

09:50.098 --> 09:52.298
Or that we both need.

09:52.338 --> 09:53.997
Nice place.

09:54.418 --> 09:56.919
Yeah, funding issues, apparently.

10:06.218 --> 10:08.527
Still as you can, OK?

10:08.552 --> 10:11.392
Any movement disrupts
the brainwave frequency.

10:13.578 --> 10:16.141
You probably have me
down as some sort of wacko

10:16.166 --> 10:18.021
that chases poltergeists and...

10:18.061 --> 10:20.541
ghoulies and things that
go bump in the night.

10:20.581 --> 10:22.341
Am I right?

10:22.718 --> 10:25.661
Right, this detects
any unusual fluctuations

10:25.701 --> 10:28.230
in the electromagnetic field.

10:28.255 --> 10:30.855
Hence the protective
casings round the cameras.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.221
It's never easy when two worlds collide.

10:34.261 --> 10:37.852
Trying to convince my colleagues
in the... scientific community

10:37.877 --> 10:40.626
that human consciousness
can alter the physical world,

10:40.651 --> 10:43.166
has been something of a bumpy ride.

10:43.336 --> 10:44.899
But then again,

10:44.930 --> 10:49.221
given that it challenges every known
law of physics and thermodynamics,

10:49.261 --> 10:51.381
it's hardly surprising.

10:51.421 --> 10:53.641
Right, I think we're set.

10:54.258 --> 10:56.836
OK. Relaxed as you can.

10:56.861 --> 11:00.621
Right. Four dice in the tube.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.181
It will rotate and jumble them.

11:03.593 --> 11:05.477
I want you to pick a number

11:05.502 --> 11:09.445
and make all four dice fall
showing that number, OK?

11:11.850 --> 11:13.488
Number six.

11:22.461 --> 11:23.971
Again.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.525
Preclude the factor of chance.

11:32.674 --> 11:34.205
Again.

11:38.039 --> 11:39.448
Again.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.949
Again.

11:49.479 --> 11:50.567
Good.

11:50.965 --> 11:53.036
Moving on...

11:53.156 --> 11:54.629
Right...

11:56.621 --> 11:58.701
16 lights.

11:58.741 --> 12:01.614
They'll move in a clockwise rotation.

12:01.661 --> 12:04.004
I want you to change the
direction of the lights

12:04.029 --> 12:07.536
so they move in an
anticlockwise direction. OK?

13:25.155 --> 13:26.875
OK. All over.

13:31.056 --> 13:33.018
Just relax.

13:35.864 --> 13:38.024
Are we done now?

13:41.328 --> 13:45.421
Why don't you er... pop
out and get some air?

13:45.461 --> 13:48.734
You know er... give
us a chance to review.

13:49.116 --> 13:51.316
Work out the next step.

14:02.444 --> 14:05.508
Have you any idea what
we've just witnessed here?

14:06.141 --> 14:09.821
I mean... we're not talking
about bending a few spoons.

14:09.861 --> 14:12.477
This is a whole different league.

14:12.836 --> 14:15.181
His parents are divorced, you say?

14:16.322 --> 14:19.701
Disruption of family life,
hormones, turbulence of puberty.

14:19.741 --> 14:22.381
It's textbook. You know,
time and time again,

14:22.421 --> 14:24.861
I've maintained that
adolescence is the optimum time

14:24.901 --> 14:27.748
for psychic phenomena
to manifest themselves.

14:28.461 --> 14:30.030
OK...

14:30.055 --> 14:31.997
we need to run more tests.

14:32.022 --> 14:33.941
More advanced this time.

14:33.981 --> 14:36.141
And we'll invite the scientific press.

14:36.181 --> 14:37.872
You know, Nature, The Lancet,

14:37.897 --> 14:39.751
all the science and
neuroscience journals,

14:39.776 --> 14:41.259
the whole bloody lot!

14:41.284 --> 14:42.541
A live...

14:42.774 --> 14:46.021
demonstration of psychokinesis.

14:46.259 --> 14:49.015
- It's a game-changer.
- And what about duty of care?

14:49.040 --> 14:50.821
Where does that come in?

14:51.126 --> 14:54.751
I brought that boy here
for your clinical input.

14:55.196 --> 14:57.821
To help me give him
the support he needs.

14:57.861 --> 14:59.861
You brought him here because...

14:59.901 --> 15:04.384
he challenges your entrenched world
view of scientific probability.

15:04.409 --> 15:06.507
That puts him beyond your help.

15:06.532 --> 15:09.861
Until he learns not
just to accept his gift

15:10.188 --> 15:13.929
but to celebrate it, he'll
never harness its full potential.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.939
- That's what I can offer him.
- Come on.

15:15.964 --> 15:17.993
It's what he can offer you, surely.

15:18.431 --> 15:22.290
I've read about your years of
professional contempt and ridicule,

15:22.315 --> 15:25.341
the professional humiliation, and now...

15:25.381 --> 15:27.040
hallelujah!

15:27.923 --> 15:29.720
You're vindicated.

15:30.302 --> 15:32.622
You get the recognition you deserve.

15:33.501 --> 15:36.501
If he's old enough to
have sex and join the army,

15:36.541 --> 15:38.804
he's old enough to
determine his own future.

15:38.829 --> 15:42.821
No, not on my watch. He's way too
fragile to make a life choice like that.

15:44.703 --> 15:46.530
Let me be clear about this.

15:47.538 --> 15:49.821
If you go public with
this, I'll come after you.

15:50.304 --> 15:53.341
I'll impugn any last shred
of credibility you still have.

15:53.381 --> 15:55.421
Social media, scientific journals,

15:55.461 --> 15:59.470
I'll shout it at stark-bollock-naked
from the rooftops if I have to.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.941
I'll claim you deliberately
rigged his test results

16:02.981 --> 16:04.501
for your own mercenary motives.

16:04.541 --> 16:06.753
That they're nothing more
than trickery and fraud.

16:06.778 --> 16:08.106
In short,

16:08.131 --> 16:12.551
your so-called career will
be over. I'll bury you.

16:25.325 --> 16:28.021
Wasted trip, I'm
afraid. Sorry about that.

16:28.419 --> 16:30.659
Divergences of opinion on ethics.

16:30.684 --> 16:32.484
Among other things.

16:34.981 --> 16:37.741
Trust me, she's not
the way for us to go.

16:37.781 --> 16:39.581
So now what?

16:39.791 --> 16:42.181
I do another performing
monkey act for another nut-job?

16:42.221 --> 16:44.981
- I'm not a fucking freak show.
- Look, I'm new to this, all right?

16:45.021 --> 16:46.721
Give me time.

16:47.861 --> 16:49.323
We'll get there.

16:49.348 --> 16:51.151
I've got your back.

17:03.058 --> 17:05.393
Not sure you chose the best day.

17:10.835 --> 17:14.335
The doctor thinks she's had more mini
strokes, which is why she is so weak.

17:15.781 --> 17:19.941
- But she'll be all right?
- She's a fighter, this one.

17:20.186 --> 17:23.843
Talk to her. If anyone can
get through to her, it's you.

17:44.607 --> 17:46.030
Gran?

17:48.571 --> 17:50.811
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me.

17:56.021 --> 17:58.341
I saw the starlings again.

17:58.576 --> 18:00.176
Thousands of them.

18:01.182 --> 18:03.702
Like a cloud of smoke,
except it was alive.

18:06.421 --> 18:09.943
I know you said I should control
it, and I've tried, Gran, I have.

18:11.097 --> 18:13.137
But if it's genetic then...

18:13.201 --> 18:15.061
it's part of you, isn't it?

18:15.936 --> 18:17.896
It's programmed in your DNA.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.726
It's who you are.

18:24.709 --> 18:26.949
I know how it ended for him now.

18:29.197 --> 18:31.557
Is that why you never told me before?

18:31.677 --> 18:33.661
In case I ended up the same way?

18:38.701 --> 18:41.100
Was he afraid he might hurt someone?

18:42.161 --> 18:44.361
But what if he already had?

18:55.824 --> 18:56.833
Hey.

18:56.871 --> 19:00.801
He's awake and talking...
and out of intensive care.

19:01.655 --> 19:03.145
Thought you'd wanna know.

19:03.170 --> 19:05.348
- Catch you at home.
- Faith, wait

19:08.507 --> 19:10.867
I'm gonna sort myself out. I am.

19:11.570 --> 19:13.162
Whatever.

19:35.350 --> 19:37.741
I think that's when he really knew,

19:37.781 --> 19:42.021
that like his grandfather he
might never control his power,

19:42.061 --> 19:44.901
that no-one around
him would ever be safe.

19:45.436 --> 19:48.781
And the thought filled him with terror.

19:49.053 --> 19:51.101
What's that thing they say?

19:51.141 --> 19:55.326
There is no greater
fear than fear itself.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.204
If you'd like to come through this way.

20:04.229 --> 20:05.657
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

20:22.566 --> 20:23.758
Sorry.

20:23.798 --> 20:26.470
Bloody lists went on
forever. Take a seat.

20:26.918 --> 20:30.198
- Has he called?
- Care home have.

20:30.238 --> 20:33.758
It seems he visited my mother.
Stayed there most of the morning.

20:36.518 --> 20:37.960
I erm...

20:39.650 --> 20:42.250
never thought I'd hear
myself say this, but...

20:43.758 --> 20:46.078
I think he should
come and live with you.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.718
Just for the foreseeable future, anyway.

20:49.765 --> 20:52.365
Just because he was AWOL for one night?

20:52.398 --> 20:56.208
Come on, it's more than one night. He's
barely at home. He's barely at college.

20:56.365 --> 20:57.994
It's because he...

20:59.667 --> 21:02.058
he needs more than I can give him.

21:06.518 --> 21:08.758
Did he tell you that erm...

21:09.331 --> 21:12.167
Victor's daughter
Faith lives with us now?

21:12.987 --> 21:15.252
Yeah, well, I think that...

21:15.398 --> 21:17.831
something might be going on there.

21:17.987 --> 21:20.893
Hormonal teenagers
living in close proximity.

21:20.918 --> 21:23.398
Yeah, but if they weren't
living in close proximity,

21:23.438 --> 21:25.971
they wouldn't be tempted, would they?

21:26.318 --> 21:29.256
She is his sister in all but name and...

21:30.436 --> 21:32.758
Victor's... He's very
protective of her...

21:32.798 --> 21:35.038
I got that loud and clear.

21:38.118 --> 21:41.143
He didn't tell you, did
he? He came to see me.

21:41.438 --> 21:45.038
Informed me that our son was
now totally out of control.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.096
So he smokes a bit of
weed every now and then!

21:47.121 --> 21:49.721
Who doesn't at his age?
And the coup de grace...

21:49.947 --> 21:53.541
he said he might have the same
mental health issues as my father.

21:53.905 --> 21:55.323
You believe him?

21:55.565 --> 21:58.141
Does that man know nothing
of adolescent behaviour?

21:58.166 --> 22:00.291
He does his best with
him, Ed, he really does.

22:00.316 --> 22:03.510
They just need some time out
from each other, that's all.

22:08.703 --> 22:10.838
I'll... I'll talk to Beth.

22:11.278 --> 22:13.278
OK. Thank you.

22:18.897 --> 22:20.434
Come on.

22:22.678 --> 22:24.434
He's grown up.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.040
Yeah, they do that.

22:29.998 --> 22:31.928
Do you ever regret it?

22:34.016 --> 22:36.416
The way things turned out for us?

22:40.798 --> 22:41.964
Well...

22:42.518 --> 22:46.478
people often say they regret
the things they haven't done.

22:46.808 --> 22:50.198
Don't they? The opportunities
they let pass by.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.736
I think it's the reverse.

22:54.118 --> 22:56.097
Maybe I should've let it pass by.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.333
You?

23:02.198 --> 23:03.638
Well, I...

23:05.238 --> 23:07.598
I suppose I regret how...

23:08.798 --> 23:10.880
unforgiving I was.

23:11.318 --> 23:13.638
And I gave you cause.

23:14.758 --> 23:16.033
Anyway...

23:16.511 --> 23:18.555
the bed we now lie in?

23:18.671 --> 23:19.955
Yeah.

23:20.745 --> 23:23.128
And our son has to.

23:26.464 --> 23:28.744
Call me, won't you, when
you've spoken to Beth?

23:30.438 --> 23:31.929
Take care.

23:44.613 --> 23:47.986
16 lights...

23:55.975 --> 23:59.124
OK. OK, it's all over.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.518
You said your grandfather had it too.

24:08.558 --> 24:10.118
What's the story there?

24:10.158 --> 24:12.038
It killed him.

24:37.132 --> 24:38.480
Edward Jarrett.

24:39.678 --> 24:41.058
Hello?

25:08.798 --> 25:10.178
Jack?

25:12.912 --> 25:15.318
The builders are
finally making progress.

25:15.669 --> 25:18.217
The plaster in the bedroom
hasn't dried. It's taking forever.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.038
Max's going and he's got asthma!

25:20.078 --> 25:22.045
Do you really think if we
keep having this conversation

25:22.069 --> 25:23.638
it'll come out the way you want?

25:29.693 --> 25:33.078
It's this Outward Bound
school trip thing to the Lakes.

25:33.118 --> 25:34.349
I vetoed it.

25:34.374 --> 25:36.155
One of them came back with a
broken collarbone last year.

25:36.179 --> 25:37.505
It's not worth the risk.

25:40.068 --> 25:41.092
Contractions?

25:41.117 --> 25:43.128
No, they just keep kicking each other.

25:45.198 --> 25:47.704
Jack never talks about the
twins. Have you noticed?

25:47.798 --> 25:50.078
It's not real to him yet, is it?

25:50.118 --> 25:51.998
Or he doesn't want to think about it.

25:52.038 --> 25:55.134
Maybe he knows his
life is about to change.

25:55.918 --> 26:00.758
That you are gonna have
your hands full with them.

26:00.798 --> 26:02.970
24/7.

26:03.306 --> 26:05.429
Hence the point of getting extra help.

26:05.454 --> 26:08.278
Yes, but everything's still
gonna revolve around them.

26:08.318 --> 26:12.814
I mean, he's used to
having you all to himself.

26:12.839 --> 26:15.559
We do not want him resenting
them from the get-go.

26:16.962 --> 26:19.673
If he had someone here for company...

26:19.768 --> 26:21.260
male company, I mean,

26:21.285 --> 26:24.166
kick a ball around with
or... hang out with.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.958
He has you for that.

26:26.208 --> 26:29.822
You know how full-on work can
get. Some days I'm barely here.

26:32.576 --> 26:34.798
Hannah came to see me at work.

26:36.118 --> 26:38.795
Seems things are a little
fraught at home right now.

26:38.820 --> 26:41.678
We've got two boys, they
get on well with each other.

26:41.718 --> 26:43.303
This could be a win-win for everybody.

26:43.328 --> 26:45.545
If you want your son to
live with us, just say so.

26:45.570 --> 26:48.389
Don't dress it up like
it's all for Jack's sake.

26:48.865 --> 26:50.718
I've turned my back on him long enough.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.067
And I'm to blame for that?

26:52.092 --> 26:54.238
No, it's not about blame!

26:54.278 --> 26:56.158
He's a teenager!

26:56.198 --> 27:00.294
He can be unpredictable. I know how
hard that is for you to deal with.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.438
Look, you can't insulate
us all from life.

27:03.478 --> 27:06.198
Like Jack and his damn field trip.

27:06.238 --> 27:08.518
'Cause that's no life for him.

27:08.558 --> 27:10.438
Or the twins.

27:10.478 --> 27:12.398
Or any of us.

27:14.038 --> 27:15.460
- Sweetheart, come on.
- No.

27:15.485 --> 27:17.758
We have to be able to
talk about this stuff.

27:17.798 --> 27:19.288
Just don't.

27:19.313 --> 27:21.273
Beth... come on, look.

27:21.569 --> 27:23.423
The dishwasher needs to go on.

27:23.448 --> 27:25.448
Just rinse the plates first.

27:33.678 --> 27:35.678
Ed!

27:36.998 --> 27:38.507
Oh, God!

27:38.539 --> 27:39.685
Ed!

27:39.881 --> 27:41.841
Ed! They're coming!

28:13.098 --> 28:14.657
Ready?

29:00.717 --> 29:02.903
It's all right. It's all right

29:02.928 --> 29:04.566
I've got you, I've got you.

29:04.707 --> 29:06.398
It's all right.

29:06.438 --> 29:07.910
I'm here.

29:08.356 --> 29:10.878
OK? All right?

29:42.537 --> 29:44.657
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:47.097 --> 29:48.802
State of you.

29:48.827 --> 29:50.347
Come on.

29:50.697 --> 29:52.257
Come on.

29:52.936 --> 29:54.341
Right.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.900
How's Azfal doing?

30:00.617 --> 30:02.617
He's getting there.

30:05.557 --> 30:07.227
I can come...

30:07.582 --> 30:09.071
if you want.

30:09.817 --> 30:11.524
To the funeral.

30:12.937 --> 30:14.431
You'd do that?

30:29.011 --> 30:30.594
Medicinal.

30:57.697 --> 30:59.817
Must we go through this again?

30:59.857 --> 31:01.297
Today of all days.

31:01.337 --> 31:04.057
All I ask is you keep an open mind.

31:04.097 --> 31:06.577
He's not some crank I
plucked off the internet.

31:06.617 --> 31:10.081
He's appointed by the Bishop,
trained at the Vatican.

31:11.177 --> 31:13.824
By putting it off, you're putting
the boy at risk, can you not see that?

31:13.848 --> 31:15.839
I asked him about that night.

31:15.878 --> 31:18.497
All he remembers is you
waking him from a bad dream.

31:18.537 --> 31:20.392
- The rest...
- Is what?

31:20.417 --> 31:22.073
Ignorant black man
getting all voodoo on you?

31:22.097 --> 31:24.354
For God's sake.

31:24.379 --> 31:27.537
Because he has no memory of it,
it doesn't mean it didn't happen.

31:27.577 --> 31:29.291
Do you think I'd make it up?

31:29.316 --> 31:30.564
I think...

31:30.589 --> 31:32.611
you saw what you wanted to see.

31:32.636 --> 31:35.416
You've always seen the
worst in him. Always.

31:35.441 --> 31:36.728
Why is that?

31:39.427 --> 31:42.257
It was dark. He had a bad dream.

31:42.724 --> 31:45.507
You'd been up most the night with the
baby. You were half asleep yourself.

31:45.531 --> 31:47.490
Now, let it go, Victor. I mean it.

31:47.515 --> 31:49.232
Because if you don't...

31:50.937 --> 31:53.137
I'm not sure where that leaves us.

33:56.377 --> 33:58.057
So what do we do with her ashes?

34:00.217 --> 34:02.657
There's nothing in her
will about where to do it.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.829
I know she meant well...

34:10.242 --> 34:13.417
but all that stuff she went on about...

34:13.456 --> 34:16.056
how like my father you are...

34:17.577 --> 34:19.817
You're not him.

34:20.531 --> 34:22.473
Not even remotely.

34:26.597 --> 34:28.637
Come here, you.

35:22.097 --> 35:23.752
Letting it go, like you asked.

35:23.777 --> 35:25.561
Going with your version.

35:40.137 --> 35:42.137
My version?

35:44.645 --> 35:48.114
I was half asleep, it was
dark, I mistook what I saw.

35:49.044 --> 35:52.559
It won't work if you're only
doing it for my sake, Victor.

35:52.614 --> 35:55.512
I'm doing it for us. For the family.

35:57.090 --> 35:59.397
I was tired. I made a mistake.

35:59.422 --> 36:00.936
Leave it there, OK?

36:01.141 --> 36:02.533
Please.

36:05.817 --> 36:07.657
I'll put the kettle on.

36:27.617 --> 36:31.217
When was the first time you
realised you had this er... power?

36:31.257 --> 36:33.321
Your very first memory of it.

36:35.097 --> 36:36.926
Been there since forever.

36:36.951 --> 36:39.297
Since before your parents divorced?

36:41.817 --> 36:44.657
And... after the divorce?

36:45.897 --> 36:49.314
After they remarried,
started their new families...

36:49.857 --> 36:52.571
is that what triggered the bad stuff?

36:52.822 --> 36:55.102
When you lost control of it.

36:58.252 --> 36:59.516
So...

37:00.217 --> 37:04.696
when you have one of these episodes,
it's... anger that triggers it?

37:08.577 --> 37:10.801
To the point you ever feel violent?

37:14.745 --> 37:17.905
Have you ever directed that
violence towards anyone?

37:22.417 --> 37:24.217
He pulled through.

37:30.365 --> 37:32.737
When I ask you once...

37:32.777 --> 37:37.325
how you felt when you lost
control, you said "ecstasy".

37:37.350 --> 37:39.085
Do you remember?

37:39.662 --> 37:41.450
"Ecstasy".

37:42.372 --> 37:46.017
And from the ancient Greek
"eks", meaning "to be apart from",

37:46.057 --> 37:49.590
and "tasi", which means "yourself".

37:51.651 --> 37:54.057
- The point is?
- Well, isn't it that feeling

37:54.082 --> 37:57.897
and where it could lead
to that you're afraid of?

38:01.006 --> 38:03.904
History doesn't have to repeat itself.

38:04.497 --> 38:06.497
Your grandfather.

38:08.191 --> 38:12.911
Another source of the word
"ecstasy" means "to remove oneself".

38:14.497 --> 38:16.857
- From what?
- The trigger points.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.275
Danger.

39:13.679 --> 39:15.218
_

39:19.337 --> 39:21.817
Shush, bedtime.

39:22.239 --> 39:23.772
Come on.

40:23.542 --> 40:25.737
I was the chosen one.

40:25.777 --> 40:27.693
I got more than a note.

40:28.137 --> 40:29.777
He didn't do it in person.

40:29.817 --> 40:32.123
He is a boy, after all.

40:32.732 --> 40:35.977
But it was me he
trusted with his secret.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.959
Everything that that happened,
from his first memories of it

40:38.984 --> 40:41.592
to the day he walked
out of all our lives.

41:09.457 --> 41:12.137
So... you know it all now.

41:13.864 --> 41:15.977
Why this is best for everyone.

41:18.229 --> 41:20.589
You and me can't ever happen.

41:22.057 --> 41:23.641
I get that now.

41:24.684 --> 41:27.088
It has to work this time, for Mum.

41:28.297 --> 41:30.055
Her marriage, I mean.

41:30.636 --> 41:32.711
And as for Dad, well...

41:33.802 --> 41:35.916
what he doesn't know can't hurt him.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.540
Just think of me now and again, yeah?

41:45.850 --> 41:47.388
Faith...

41:48.377 --> 41:50.014
remember the deal.

42:18.297 --> 42:20.377
He sends us emails from time to time

42:20.417 --> 42:22.380
from various internet cafÃ©s,

42:22.405 --> 42:25.457
saying he's OK and
not to worry about him.

42:25.497 --> 42:27.482
And life went on.

42:27.697 --> 42:29.560
As it does.

42:29.749 --> 42:31.429
You're gonna go, you're gotta go.

42:31.486 --> 42:33.881
Hold him.

42:34.507 --> 42:36.109
Fantastic!

42:42.777 --> 42:45.457
Where's it gone? "I want to go to bed."

42:45.497 --> 42:49.857
Are you eating it? You can't eat it...

42:51.158 --> 42:55.217
A year or so later, I
caught something on YouTube.

42:55.257 --> 42:57.257
So I went to check it out.

44:24.497 --> 44:27.919
I had it in mind to
say hello, you know...

44:28.229 --> 44:30.469
reconnect with him.

44:31.493 --> 44:32.898
But he looked happy.

44:35.968 --> 44:37.327
Come on...

44:38.632 --> 44:42.097
I told you already. I just
figured if I keep nagging you...

44:42.137 --> 44:43.335
Come on...

45:21.297 --> 45:26.177
There are times, aren't there,
when we all wonder, "is this it"?

45:26.217 --> 45:30.686
Is life no more than a random collection
of events that just happen to us?

45:32.857 --> 45:38.937
Or are there unseen, unexplained forces
at work, beyond our understanding?

45:39.433 --> 45:42.191
That perhaps, after all...

45:42.899 --> 45:45.259
we are immortal.
