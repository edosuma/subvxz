WEBVTT

00:12.659 --> 00:14.462
- No.

00:15.665 --> 00:17.636
I don't want any,
and/or I didn't do it.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.540
Damn it, Edith.

00:19.573 --> 00:21.544
I'll stop throwing trash
off my balcony

00:21.577 --> 00:23.313
when the co-op
installs a garbage chute

00:23.346 --> 00:25.250
per my written request.

00:25.284 --> 00:26.787
Hey, Archer.
I'm here!

00:26.820 --> 00:28.724
And here is
where you're supposed to be?

00:28.758 --> 00:31.229
Wait, did you
forget you invited me over?

00:31.262 --> 00:32.532
I remember
not doing that.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.035
Probably because
you've been making

00:34.068 --> 00:36.372
a lot of drunk promises lately
and empty threats.

00:36.406 --> 00:38.678
Suggest that again,
and I will literally kill you.

00:38.711 --> 00:41.249
Okay, well, last night,
you invited me over

00:41.282 --> 00:43.320
for a brunchy hang.

00:43.353 --> 00:44.790
One, that's a phrase
I would never use,

00:44.823 --> 00:47.294
like "shoot to wound,"
and two--

00:47.328 --> 00:48.831
you're already inside.
- Yeah.

00:48.864 --> 00:50.434
The green eggs and Pam
are getting cold.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.672
The "Pam" is ham.

00:54.242 --> 00:55.377
Cyril?
To what do I owe

00:55.410 --> 00:56.614
this opposite of pleasure?

00:56.647 --> 00:58.517
Hey, Archer,
I'm here for the--

00:58.551 --> 01:00.320
The brunchy hang,
which is what we're doing.

01:00.354 --> 01:02.424
That I don't
remember suggesting?

01:02.458 --> 01:03.594
- Yeah.
- And even

01:03.628 --> 01:05.632
at my most drunk,
wouldn't invite Cyril to?

01:05.665 --> 01:06.734
Yup.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.438
And here's everyone else
you invited!

01:09.472 --> 01:10.842
Hey, big guy.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.512
Let me guess--
brunchy hang?

01:12.545 --> 01:14.115
Oh, God, no.

01:14.148 --> 01:15.450
We're here
for the intervention.

01:15.484 --> 01:17.288
Oh, yeah!
It's also that.

01:17.321 --> 01:18.591
God damn it, Pam.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.532
Who wants
some cheesy grits?

02:02.311 --> 02:03.914
Ah, so...

02:03.948 --> 02:05.818
Wait, wait, wait.
There's still juice in here.

02:10.293 --> 02:11.864
Now, what's
this about an intervention?

02:11.897 --> 02:13.333
It's not
for your drinking.

02:13.366 --> 02:14.302
Good,
because if anything,

02:14.335 --> 02:15.270
I'm getting better at that.

02:15.304 --> 02:16.439
It's an intervention

02:16.472 --> 02:17.709
for whatever's
causing your drinking.

02:17.742 --> 02:19.412
- Thirst?
- But under that.

02:19.445 --> 02:21.182
- Boredom?
- But under that.

02:21.215 --> 02:23.486
Irritation
with your gentle tone?

02:23.521 --> 02:25.625
Enough holding
his damn hand!

02:25.658 --> 02:27.529
Archer, ever since Malory left,

02:27.562 --> 02:30.367
you treat us like shit,
you spy like shit,

02:30.400 --> 02:31.737
and you're gonna
get us all killed.

02:31.770 --> 02:33.273
Please, I spy great.

02:33.306 --> 02:34.943
Just last week,
I took down a drug kingpin.

02:34.976 --> 02:37.481
Yeah,
that is not what happened.

02:37.515 --> 02:38.718
Ooh!

02:38.751 --> 02:42.559
That's for giving
drugs to kids!

02:42.592 --> 02:43.894
Next.

02:43.928 --> 02:45.798
We don't know
what's in those inhalers.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.301
We know two kids
had asthma attacks.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.671
Well, I for one,

02:48.704 --> 02:50.340
think this intervention
is unnecessary.

02:50.374 --> 02:51.610
Thank you, Krieger.

02:51.643 --> 02:53.581
I mean,
why convince a man to change,

02:53.614 --> 02:55.685
when I think cut out the chunk
of brain causing the problem

02:55.718 --> 02:57.756
and replace it with nanobots
that I control?

02:57.789 --> 02:59.526
Can you cut out
the part of five brains

02:59.559 --> 03:01.496
that are clearly jealous
of my skills?

03:01.530 --> 03:03.601
- Happy to try.
- You think we're jealous?

03:03.634 --> 03:05.538
We're worried.
- And frustrated.

03:05.571 --> 03:06.840
And would it
have killed you

03:06.874 --> 03:08.611
to visit me in the hospital?

03:08.644 --> 03:11.550
'Cause that snakebite
you caused almost killed me.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.521
I'm pretty sure
that was a tapir's fault.

03:13.554 --> 03:15.691
You found it.
Don't blame the tapir.

03:15.725 --> 03:17.494
Enough.
There's a way these things

03:17.529 --> 03:18.931
are supposed to go.

03:18.964 --> 03:21.269
Archer,
I made a list of the ways

03:21.302 --> 03:22.839
in which your behavior
has hurt me.

03:22.872 --> 03:24.776
I've had to cover for you
on missions,

03:24.810 --> 03:26.980
lie for you at the office,

03:27.014 --> 03:31.222
olive oil, carrots...
toe cream?

03:31.255 --> 03:33.460
Did you get bored and start
making a grocery list?

03:33.493 --> 03:35.732
Cheryl usually proofreads
my speeches.

03:35.765 --> 03:37.769
Are we gonna try to get her
to come back, by the way?

03:37.802 --> 03:39.639
One crisis at a time, Pam.

03:39.673 --> 03:41.375
Then go handle
that crisis.

03:41.409 --> 03:43.480
I am fine.
- Not until you agree

03:43.514 --> 03:45.450
to see a therapist.
- Uh, agreed,

03:45.484 --> 03:47.856
because I already do.
- What? Since when?

03:47.889 --> 03:49.926
Ever since Mother retired.
I was a wreck.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.830
I needed help.
I got help.

03:51.864 --> 03:55.404
Oh, what happens now?
Do we still tie him to a chair?

03:55.437 --> 03:56.740
That's the main reason
I came.

03:56.774 --> 03:58.677
If you're seeing
a therapist--

03:58.711 --> 04:01.583
hmm, how do I phrase this
positively?

04:01.617 --> 04:03.621
Why are you still
such an ass on an ass?

04:03.654 --> 04:05.290
Well, Dr. Lacania says

04:05.323 --> 04:07.729
the process of unpacking
my traumas can be destabilizing

04:07.762 --> 04:09.265
before I see improvement.

04:09.298 --> 04:10.467
Plus, we're dealing
with a lot--

04:10.501 --> 04:13.741
impulse control,
abandonment issues, PTSD...

04:13.774 --> 04:15.745
Self-medicating.

04:15.778 --> 04:19.485
Holy shitsnacks.
Archer's in therapy.

04:21.088 --> 04:23.694
Brain chunks,
snip-snip, think about it.

04:23.727 --> 04:25.932
No one even tried
my potato salad.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.569
It's a secret family recipe.

04:27.602 --> 04:28.904
Is the secret
way too much dill?

04:28.938 --> 04:30.508
No!

04:30.541 --> 04:31.810
Yes.

04:31.844 --> 04:33.814
Archer,
I am so proud of you.

04:33.848 --> 04:35.050
It's been a tough year,

04:35.083 --> 04:36.486
but knowing
you're putting in the work,

04:36.520 --> 04:37.622
it means a lot.

04:37.655 --> 04:39.024
I'll log your therapist
with IIA.

04:39.058 --> 04:40.995
Having it on record should help
if there's any blowback.

04:41.028 --> 04:42.565
What's her name again?

04:42.599 --> 04:44.803
- Dr. Lacania.
- Jesus!

04:44.836 --> 04:46.940
As far as you're
concerned, yes.

04:46.974 --> 04:48.476
Why are you on my screen?

04:48.511 --> 04:50.080
Wait, can you see
what's on my screen before?

04:50.113 --> 04:51.517
'Cause I just sat down.

04:51.550 --> 04:52.752
I don't know
how all these tabs are open.

04:52.785 --> 04:54.756
I have thousands
of employees.

04:54.789 --> 04:56.860
Tapping into their screens
saves time

04:56.894 --> 04:59.331
and helps me avoid
smelling you in person.

04:59.365 --> 05:00.935
Your loss.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.705
I saw your report
that Agent Archer

05:02.739 --> 05:04.375
is seeing a therapist.

05:04.408 --> 05:07.347
Let me guess,
IIA doesn't approve of therapy?

05:07.381 --> 05:09.886
Quite the contrary.
Mental health is as essential

05:09.920 --> 05:12.692
as physical health.
- Oh, sweet.

05:12.725 --> 05:14.729
That said,
Agent Archer's therapist

05:14.763 --> 05:17.936
will be immediately executed
by IIA assassins.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.973
What? Why?
She's out of network.

05:20.006 --> 05:21.877
It poses a security risk

05:21.910 --> 05:25.483
and puts an unfair burden
on the IIA health plan.

05:25.518 --> 05:26.854
You read the health plan,
didn't you?

05:26.887 --> 05:28.591
I skimmed it.

05:28.624 --> 05:30.393
I'm afraid
it's out of my hands.

05:30.427 --> 05:32.966
Better luck next therapist, eh?

05:32.999 --> 05:35.070
Oh.
How much of that did you hear?

05:35.103 --> 05:37.074
IIA's gonna kill
my therapist?

05:37.107 --> 05:38.944
Okay, good,
you heard the main part.

05:40.013 --> 05:41.048
Not to repeat myself,

05:41.082 --> 05:42.719
but God damn it, Pam!

05:42.752 --> 05:44.823
I'm sorry!
How was I supposed to know

05:44.856 --> 05:47.494
the IIA kills
out-of-network therapists?

05:47.529 --> 05:49.766
Yeah,
those co-pays are murder.

05:49.799 --> 05:51.369
Sorry.
I'd wiggle my eyebrows,

05:51.402 --> 05:53.541
but my forehead's still
paralyzed from spider venom.

05:53.574 --> 05:54.776
Wait,
is it just therapists?

05:54.809 --> 05:56.445
What's about dentists?
Dr. Beck is the only man

05:56.479 --> 05:57.916
I trust to handle
my porous teeth.

05:57.949 --> 05:58.951
That's where I come in,

05:58.984 --> 06:00.453
and haven't we all wondered,

06:00.487 --> 06:02.491
"Why do we have teeth
only in our mouths?"

06:02.525 --> 06:03.994
Oh, yeah.

06:04.028 --> 06:06.499
Looks like you and your
crumbly teeth are out of luck.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.537
Who cares?
Cyril can get new teeth.

06:08.571 --> 06:11.008
I can't spend a year explaining
my thrilling yet complicated

06:11.042 --> 06:12.579
backstory to a new therapist.

06:12.612 --> 06:14.114
And you won't have to,

06:14.148 --> 06:15.952
because we'll help you
save her.

06:15.985 --> 06:17.989
Is that a royal "we"?

06:18.022 --> 06:20.493
Because this is not
part of my job, okay?

06:20.528 --> 06:22.431
I keep my head down,
and I put in the work.

06:22.464 --> 06:24.001
But it is your job
to work with me,

06:24.034 --> 06:25.771
which will be
even more impossible

06:25.805 --> 06:27.140
if my therapist dies.

06:27.174 --> 06:28.476
What would that
even look like?

06:28.510 --> 06:29.946
We're on a clock here, people.

06:29.980 --> 06:31.883
Fine,
I'll help you to help me.

06:31.917 --> 06:33.186
Dr. Lacania
would call that

06:33.219 --> 06:35.023
a transactional relationship.
It's not great,

06:35.056 --> 06:36.192
but it's a start--

06:36.225 --> 06:37.127
And it won't
be enough.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.465
Jesus, Max Headroom.

06:39.498 --> 06:40.835
I'm working.
I'm working.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.839
I just came in here
for this grenade.

06:42.872 --> 06:44.843
Uh, my lucky grenade.

06:44.876 --> 06:46.613
Fabian,
call off the hit.

06:46.647 --> 06:48.751
It's out of my hands, Archer.

06:48.784 --> 06:51.055
The assassination order
already went out.

06:51.088 --> 06:54.061
Your therapist is as good as--

06:54.094 --> 06:56.733
You know,
some of us do work on those.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.169
- Nerd.
- Fabian's wrong.

06:58.202 --> 06:59.940
We'll save her.
- Will we?

06:59.973 --> 07:02.477
Every time we go up
against IIA, we lose.

07:02.512 --> 07:04.516
They're always one step ahead.
- Which means we need

07:04.549 --> 07:07.087
to stay one step ahead
of that step.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.559
Krieger, what do ya got?
- Hmm, my first idea

07:09.592 --> 07:11.697
would be to breed
a half-human, half-dolphin.

07:11.730 --> 07:12.966
Next idea.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.671
Aw.
Well, I can hijack

07:15.705 --> 07:18.744
the connection Fabian uses
to tap into our monitors,

07:18.777 --> 07:21.917
allowing us to monitor
all IIA body cameras

07:21.950 --> 07:24.154
and know exactly
where their assassins are.

07:24.188 --> 07:26.192
But I'd need eyes
on all the monitors--

07:26.225 --> 07:27.695
living eyes.

07:27.729 --> 07:29.799
I mean, obviously,
I've got jars of eyes.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.503
Ray, Cyril,
help Krieger.

07:31.536 --> 07:32.705
- Fine by me.
- Now listen.

07:32.739 --> 07:34.509
This is our
most important mission ever.

07:34.542 --> 07:36.012
We're not just
saving my therapist.

07:36.045 --> 07:39.552
We're saving my mental health
and by extension, the world.

07:39.586 --> 07:41.489
Let's add delusions
of grandeur to your list

07:41.523 --> 07:42.792
of issues.
- Said the man

07:42.825 --> 07:45.130
who needs therapy
more than any of us.

07:45.163 --> 07:46.767
I need therapy?
Me?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.771
Oh, that's rich.
You know who needs the therapy?

07:48.804 --> 07:51.877
The guy who says
someone else needs therapy,

07:51.910 --> 07:55.216
which I guess he's getting.
- Try it now.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.087
- Damn it, Krieger.
- In my defense,

07:57.120 --> 07:58.590
I knew that would happen.

07:58.624 --> 08:02.164
Behold--every camera
in the IIA network.

08:02.197 --> 08:04.836
I call it "Spy Wall."

08:04.869 --> 08:07.140
A lot of toilet cams
on Spy Wall, huh?

08:07.174 --> 08:08.510
I don't place the cameras.

08:08.544 --> 08:09.946
I just hack them.
- Hey, either of you

08:09.979 --> 08:12.184
ever try therapy?
- Ew--just physical.

08:12.217 --> 08:13.721
I was born well-adjusted.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.558
The scientists
made sure of that.

08:15.591 --> 08:16.860
Oh, yeah.
I mean, I don't think

08:16.893 --> 08:19.031
I need it.
I mean, I'm not that unhappy--

08:19.064 --> 08:20.968
more scared than unhappy.

08:21.002 --> 08:22.605
I'm more unhappy than scared.

08:22.638 --> 08:24.274
Right?
Hey, maybe we could

08:24.308 --> 08:26.880
talk about it--not as therapy,
which we don't need--

08:26.913 --> 08:28.584
just informal guy talk.
- Well, that takes

08:28.617 --> 08:30.688
all the pressure off.
- Hard pass.

08:30.721 --> 08:33.259
If I wanna swap traumas,
I will join a fight club.

08:33.292 --> 08:35.564
Ooh!
Let's do that too.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.034
woman:
Shit,

08:37.067 --> 08:38.804
they already have her.
- Not for long.

08:38.837 --> 08:41.676
Your brain doc is about to see
some brain damage.

08:41.710 --> 08:43.547
Wait, wait, wait.
Dr. Lacania says always

08:43.580 --> 08:45.216
to knock, even in an emergency.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.989
Hold it right--there?

08:48.022 --> 08:49.224
Sterling.

08:49.258 --> 08:50.594
She calls you Sterling?

08:50.628 --> 08:52.330
Yes.
She calls me by my name.

08:52.364 --> 08:54.001
And she requires appointments.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.838
We've talked
about respecting boundaries.

08:55.871 --> 08:57.909
Sorry, Dr. Lacania.
I can explain

08:57.942 --> 09:00.781
and pay for the door.
Can you guys give us a minute?

09:00.815 --> 09:03.620
Also, you should probably
look for a new therapist.

09:03.654 --> 09:06.092
- Wow, she looks--

09:06.125 --> 09:08.029
Like a therapist.

09:08.062 --> 09:10.133
Wearing clothes
and everything.

09:10.166 --> 09:14.074
- And he apologized to her.
- And it wasn't sarcastic.

09:14.108 --> 09:16.813
Guess he's actually trying
to be a better person.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.216
Ray, how we lookin'?

09:18.249 --> 09:20.621
Um,
multiple hostiles incoming--

09:20.654 --> 09:22.257
technically already there.
- Jesus, Ray!

09:22.290 --> 09:24.294
Thanks for the warning!
I'm doing my best!

09:24.328 --> 09:26.132
There's a ton of monitors!

09:26.165 --> 09:27.702
And a lot of feelings.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.304
Heads up.
They don't look like

09:29.338 --> 09:30.941
new patients.

09:35.183 --> 09:37.655
And you'll keep going
to therapy, young lady

09:37.688 --> 09:40.193
until you stop having
sex dreams about Grave Digger,

09:40.226 --> 09:41.863
the monster truck.

09:41.897 --> 09:44.936
- They're over here.
- We gotta go!

09:44.969 --> 09:47.207
Jesus Christ, Archer.
- Um,

09:47.240 --> 09:49.044
this is why you have to knock.

09:54.689 --> 09:55.958
I knew
you weren't in therapy.

09:55.991 --> 09:57.662
It is always
about sex with you.

09:57.695 --> 09:58.931
What?
This isn't sex.

09:58.964 --> 10:00.935
She's lying
on top of you.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.705
Because she fainted
when I told her

10:02.738 --> 10:04.676
about the assassins,
and I had to catch her.

10:04.709 --> 10:06.913
Believe me, if I was
having sex, you would know.

10:06.947 --> 10:08.984
Please.
You're obviously into her.

10:09.017 --> 10:10.988
- Inaccurate phrasing.
- But also true.

10:11.021 --> 10:13.092
- Wait, what?
- The infamous Lana,

10:13.126 --> 10:14.796
I presume?
- Infamous?

10:14.829 --> 10:17.067
You come up a lot.
It's mostly bad.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.204
In our first session,
Sterling admitted

10:19.238 --> 10:21.142
his attraction to me.
We discussed it

10:21.175 --> 10:23.079
and decided working through it

10:23.112 --> 10:25.350
would be a good exercise
in establishing boundaries.

10:25.383 --> 10:26.953
And having
vivid sex dreams.

10:26.987 --> 10:28.022
Vivid.

10:29.859 --> 10:31.228
- Probably time to go.
- Right.

10:31.262 --> 10:32.364
We need a new exit.

10:32.397 --> 10:34.268
No, you want
a new exit.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.706
You need to respect
my personal journey.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.811
I can't respect you
if we're dead.

10:38.844 --> 10:41.348
How convenient for you!
See what I deal with?

10:41.382 --> 10:42.819
I have a suggestion.

10:42.852 --> 10:45.123
My office used to be
part of a larger suite.

10:45.156 --> 10:47.962
We remodeled,
but kept the door.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.699
Damn, you're good
in a crisis, Doc.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.404
My patients
are always in crisis.

10:57.214 --> 10:59.853
Ray, are we clear?
Ray?

10:59.886 --> 11:01.288
Ray!

11:01.322 --> 11:03.059
But where does
the fear come from?

11:03.092 --> 11:05.163
Well,
when I was a child,

11:05.196 --> 11:07.067
my father trained show dogs.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.971
Cyril, shut up!

11:09.004 --> 11:11.175
Lana, you've got incoming.
- Yeah, I know.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.879
We dodged them.
Keep up.

11:12.912 --> 11:14.983
Oh, I'm sorry.
Then these assassins

11:15.016 --> 11:17.254
must be outside
a different door.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.003
Well, they're in the
right office to get new teeth.

11:25.036 --> 11:26.438
As long as
they're in-network.

11:26.472 --> 11:28.911
Fascinating.
You focus on the mundane

11:28.944 --> 11:31.282
to avoid contemplating
the barbaric nature

11:31.315 --> 11:32.885
of your work.
- Oh, my God.

11:32.919 --> 11:35.223
We don't have time for this.

11:35.256 --> 11:36.760
My apartment's
a few blocks away.

11:36.793 --> 11:37.795
We can crash there.
- Wouldn't it be better

11:37.828 --> 11:39.064
to go to a safe house?

11:39.097 --> 11:40.834
Well, my place isn't exactly

11:40.868 --> 11:42.404
an official, legal residence

11:42.437 --> 11:44.007
or zoned
for human habitation,

11:44.041 --> 11:45.811
so it pretty much
doesn't exist.

11:45.844 --> 11:48.082
That sounds good to me.
Plus, I definitely want to see

11:48.115 --> 11:50.220
Pam's place.
That's got to be a shit show.

11:50.253 --> 11:52.157
I guess Krieger's
cameras will let us know

11:52.190 --> 11:54.361
if they're on to us.
Ray, I need a safe route

11:54.394 --> 11:56.031
to Pam's.
- Well, I need legs

11:56.065 --> 11:58.035
made of meat,
but life's not fair.

11:58.069 --> 11:59.772
All right, you're gonna
take your first left--

11:59.806 --> 12:01.342
I'm sorry.
Don't take that.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.479
Take your second left.
- All I do is work--

12:03.513 --> 12:07.855
office lab, home lab, sea lab,
where the only law is science.

12:07.888 --> 12:09.324
Well, at least
you have a passion.

12:09.358 --> 12:11.328
I live in constant fear
that someone will ask me

12:11.362 --> 12:12.999
to do my job.
- But is it really

12:13.032 --> 12:15.838
a passion if it's also work?
I mean, where's the "me" time?

12:15.871 --> 12:18.109
Will you two shut up?
My God!

12:18.142 --> 12:19.812
"I'm sad.
I love being

12:19.846 --> 12:22.952
a mad scientist too much."
Try walking in my shoes.

12:22.985 --> 12:25.323
Spoiler--I have to buy
new ones every three weeks,

12:25.356 --> 12:27.260
because are shoes
aren't made for metal feet!

12:27.294 --> 12:28.462
And I've offered you

12:28.496 --> 12:30.400
tank treads
like a billion times.

12:30.433 --> 12:33.472
I had the worst childhood
and adulthood imaginable,

12:33.507 --> 12:35.209
and you don't see me
crying about it,

12:35.243 --> 12:38.082
because I got it under control,

12:38.115 --> 12:41.422
unless I see a porcupine.
- Why a porcupine?

12:41.455 --> 12:43.527
Who are you,
the therapist I don't need?

12:55.249 --> 12:59.358
Whoa, wow,
a Brough Superior SS100?

12:59.391 --> 13:01.997
This is what killed Lawrence
of Arabia.

13:02.030 --> 13:03.867
- This is your apartment?

13:03.900 --> 13:05.904
Yeah, pretty sweet, huh?

13:05.938 --> 13:07.240
I used to come to raves here.

13:07.273 --> 13:09.244
Then one morning,
I woke up on the floor

13:09.277 --> 13:12.183
with an empty bank account and
a deed scrawled on a napkin.

13:12.217 --> 13:14.922
Best decision
I didn't know I was making.

13:14.956 --> 13:16.325
Pam, you might be

13:16.358 --> 13:19.164
the first completely
psychologically healthy person

13:19.197 --> 13:21.068
I've ever met.
- Yeah, but some of us

13:21.101 --> 13:23.406
are pretty close, right?
- Uh-huh.

13:23.439 --> 13:24.976
Do you think
it's psychologically healthy

13:25.009 --> 13:26.278
to fish for compliments?

13:26.312 --> 13:27.982
Lana doesn't like therapy.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.384
Hey, I never said that.

13:29.418 --> 13:30.988
I just don't love the idea

13:31.021 --> 13:32.390
of a person who knows
everything about you

13:32.424 --> 13:34.294
and can use that information
against you--

13:34.328 --> 13:36.900
not that I have trust issues.

13:36.933 --> 13:38.469
Pam, why do you have underpants
with the Swiss flag on them?

13:38.503 --> 13:40.273
Swiss?
Those aren't Swiss.

13:40.306 --> 13:42.477
Those are, uh--
they're from the Red Cross.

13:42.511 --> 13:44.081
They're defective.

13:44.114 --> 13:47.053
Anyway, mi safe house
es tu safe house.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.057
I'm gonna check the back door.

13:49.091 --> 13:50.894
And I'm gonna ride
like Lawrence,

13:50.928 --> 13:54.201
but without the dying part.

13:54.234 --> 13:57.407
So you heard
a lot about me, huh?

13:57.440 --> 13:59.044
I can't discuss that.

13:59.077 --> 14:00.581
Right, right.

14:00.614 --> 14:03.185
It's just, you only heard
Archer's side of things,

14:03.219 --> 14:05.156
and sure, we've had our issues,

14:05.189 --> 14:07.193
but he has issues
with everyone.

14:07.227 --> 14:09.164
So I think that's unfair
to focus on me

14:09.197 --> 14:11.368
and not Pam,
who is a total enabler,

14:11.402 --> 14:13.172
or Krieger,
who's a drug designer,

14:13.205 --> 14:15.511
or Cheryl--she's the craziest
one in the entire group.

14:15.544 --> 14:17.948
So whatever problem Archer has,
it is probably because of her

14:17.982 --> 14:20.119
and not me.

14:20.153 --> 14:21.589
I'm not taking on
new patients.

14:21.623 --> 14:24.061
Whoo-hoo!

14:24.094 --> 14:25.363
I'm sorry.
Just stay in there.

14:28.469 --> 14:30.373
And just so you know,
I organized an intervention

14:30.406 --> 14:31.943
- to help Archer.
- Without

14:31.976 --> 14:33.580
a psychologist present?

14:33.613 --> 14:36.185
Well, no,
but with friends present.

14:36.218 --> 14:37.588
It helped!
You weren't there.

14:37.621 --> 14:39.959
I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, Lana, you dumped him,

14:39.992 --> 14:41.061
had a kid with his sperm,
but didn't tell him."

14:41.095 --> 14:44.936
But you only know his side.
What did he even say?

14:44.969 --> 14:47.474
Okay, I know you can't tell me.
So say nothing if it's bad.

14:47.508 --> 14:50.480
Oh, damn!
I knew it was bad!

14:50.514 --> 14:52.484
Fascinating...

14:52.518 --> 14:56.391
You're paying for the
things I break with your body!

14:58.262 --> 14:59.699
Since we're done
with therapy,

14:59.732 --> 15:01.970
could you skip to the end and
just say what my problem is?

15:02.003 --> 15:04.642
Sterling, you know
that's not how this works.

15:04.675 --> 15:08.215
Therapy is a lifelong journey
to self-discovery.

15:08.249 --> 15:09.284
But it's my mother, right?

15:09.317 --> 15:11.355
Yes,
and I'm sorry

15:11.388 --> 15:13.225
we won't have more time
to work on it.

15:13.259 --> 15:14.294
What is that?

15:14.327 --> 15:15.964
Shit,
is that a tracker?

15:15.998 --> 15:18.369
Because that would mean--

15:18.402 --> 15:20.406
Safe house isn't safe.

15:25.149 --> 15:27.120
Oh.

15:27.153 --> 15:29.191
These are vintage,
you bastards!

15:30.426 --> 15:31.563
Damn it.
Why didn't you guys

15:31.596 --> 15:33.132
see this coming?

15:33.165 --> 15:34.969
Ray!

15:35.002 --> 15:36.639
I get it now.
I see every mission

15:36.673 --> 15:38.677
as an opportunity
to disappoint my father,

15:38.710 --> 15:41.115
even though he's gone.
- And I need to finally

15:41.148 --> 15:43.419
make time for
my prog-rock puppet musical.

15:43.452 --> 15:45.256
And you did it
without therapy.

15:45.289 --> 15:46.659
And we did it
with something better--

15:46.693 --> 15:49.164
informal guy talk.
- Which is like therapy,

15:49.197 --> 15:50.534
but with fewer credentials,

15:50.567 --> 15:52.403
and a completely random
success rate.

15:52.437 --> 15:55.042
All right.
Whoopsie daisy.

15:55.076 --> 15:57.046
Wait, what?

15:59.050 --> 16:00.486
There,
I think we lost 'em.

16:00.521 --> 16:02.023
You thought that
at Pam's.

16:02.056 --> 16:03.425
I'm not omniscient, Lana.

16:03.459 --> 16:05.429
Textbook
parasitic symbiosis.

16:05.463 --> 16:07.033
Oh, will you turn it off?

16:07.066 --> 16:08.135
Damn it.
They found us.

16:08.169 --> 16:09.739
Why would they ring
the doorbell?

16:09.772 --> 16:11.041
Obviously to confuse us.

16:11.074 --> 16:12.277
Who's there?

16:12.310 --> 16:13.580
Don't shoot!

16:13.613 --> 16:15.684
It's us!
- I stand by my choice.

16:15.717 --> 16:17.320
Of course you do.

16:17.353 --> 16:18.322
Where the hell
have you guys been?

16:18.355 --> 16:20.561
And why do you look
like you've been crying?

16:20.594 --> 16:23.199
- Um, IIA cut our feed.
- Yeah,

16:23.232 --> 16:25.504
and that made us very sad.

16:25.537 --> 16:27.040
And I'm more
than a scientist!

16:27.073 --> 16:28.209
Everyone, shut up.

16:28.242 --> 16:30.179
We need to get Dr. Lacania
out of the city.

16:30.213 --> 16:32.183
And put her on a train.
It's public, crowded,

16:32.217 --> 16:33.520
and it has multiple entries.

16:33.553 --> 16:35.089
I'm not sure
they'll let me on the train

16:35.122 --> 16:36.626
covered in this much blood.

16:36.659 --> 16:38.597
Yeah, blood's
more of a subway thing.

16:38.630 --> 16:40.199
Archer, are there
any women's clothes here?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.603
Just abandoned bras,

16:41.636 --> 16:44.207
but they're covered
in whipped cream and gunpowder.

16:44.241 --> 16:47.180
The only full outfit
I have belonged to--

16:47.213 --> 16:50.119
Damn, you are wearing
that dress, girl!

16:51.388 --> 16:53.058
Stop.
This is already

16:53.092 --> 16:55.229
a very confusing moment for me.
- Why?

16:55.263 --> 16:56.766
Because your forbidden crush
is wearing the dress

16:56.799 --> 16:58.269
of the mother who kept you

16:58.302 --> 17:00.373
in a state of childlike
emotional dependence

17:00.406 --> 17:01.509
your whole life?
- Oof,

17:01.543 --> 17:03.212
it is a bit tight in the chest.

17:03.245 --> 17:05.082
- Yeah, it is.
- Oh, my God.

17:05.116 --> 17:06.786
Oh,
Archer has a forbidden crush?

17:06.819 --> 17:08.623
How naughty.

17:08.657 --> 17:11.295
Did everyone hear me
say I'm not just a scientist?

17:11.328 --> 17:12.798
Enough!
We need to go.

17:12.831 --> 17:14.502
Hang on.
They know what she looks like.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.537
They'll catch us right away.

17:15.571 --> 17:17.140
Well,
we're out of time, Lana.

17:17.173 --> 17:18.810
So unless you have an idea--
- Oh, I have an idea,

17:18.843 --> 17:20.379
and yeah, you might think
it's stupid,

17:20.413 --> 17:23.385
but I believe in it.
- And we believe in you.

17:23.419 --> 17:25.557
If we survive,
we should check the war room

17:25.591 --> 17:27.761
for gas leaks.
- To the sewing machine!

17:27.795 --> 17:29.364
Whoo-hoo!

17:29.397 --> 17:31.134
Well, sewing needles
remind me of porcupines,

17:31.168 --> 17:32.705
but sure.

17:32.738 --> 17:34.274
Sorry for this,
Dr. Lacania,

17:34.307 --> 17:35.777
but I promise
we'll get you out.

17:35.811 --> 17:38.115
I know you will,
and when you do,

17:38.148 --> 17:39.284
I want you to come with me,

17:39.317 --> 17:42.558
because I love you,
Sterling Archer.

17:44.695 --> 17:46.131
Meep.

17:51.141 --> 17:52.645
You ready for this?

17:52.678 --> 17:54.381
Are you ready to come with me?
- Dr. Lacania--

17:54.414 --> 17:55.784
Please, call me Malory.

17:55.817 --> 17:57.788
Ugh, no.
Wh--why?

17:57.821 --> 17:58.823
Well, that's my name,

17:58.857 --> 18:00.259
Malory Lacania.

18:00.293 --> 18:02.130
What an
unfortunate coincidence.

18:02.163 --> 18:03.566
Not if you forget
your past.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.570
I have seen how you've grown,

18:05.604 --> 18:08.409
what you're capable of, and now
I've seen how these people

18:08.442 --> 18:09.679
hold you back.

18:09.712 --> 18:11.783
I need
to think about it.

18:11.816 --> 18:13.385
Think fast, Sterling.

18:13.419 --> 18:16.425
The train's leaving.

18:17.861 --> 18:19.431
man: I have eyes
on the target--

18:19.464 --> 18:22.571
taking the shot in three, two--
wait!

18:22.605 --> 18:25.176
I have two targets,
two targets--no, three.

18:25.209 --> 18:27.246
Four!
Original target is lost.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.652
Repeat,
original target is lost.

18:29.685 --> 18:32.323
Let's do this.

18:32.357 --> 18:34.829
I can't believe
this is working.

18:34.862 --> 18:36.733
I can't believe
Cyril sewed five dress suits

18:36.766 --> 18:38.268
in an hour.
- Before I turned

18:38.302 --> 18:40.439
to espionage,
I was a tailor's apprentice.

18:40.473 --> 18:42.176
Is it too late
to turn back?

18:42.210 --> 18:45.216
Oh, my God.
Shit, Ray, are you made?

18:45.249 --> 18:49.224
I'm just a little boy
telling my dog she'll be okay.

18:49.257 --> 18:51.194
Just hold on, Ginger Rogers!

18:51.228 --> 18:52.330
Okay...

18:52.363 --> 18:53.600
What the hell is that?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.336
The sound
I've been looking for.

18:55.369 --> 18:57.541
You guys want to be
in a prog-rock puppet musical?

18:57.574 --> 18:59.277
Focus.
We're almost there.

18:59.311 --> 19:00.681
And it's
almost time to decide.

19:00.714 --> 19:02.317
I know.
There's literally

19:02.350 --> 19:04.187
a giant ticking clock
on the wall.

19:08.630 --> 19:11.636
man: Oh, hell, screw it.
Tranq them all.

19:11.669 --> 19:14.474
Looks like the needle
is mightier than the sword.

19:14.508 --> 19:16.512
Not, like, drug needle--
sewing needle--

19:16.546 --> 19:17.881
- Cyril?

19:17.915 --> 19:19.351
Cyril?
Does anyone have eyes

19:19.384 --> 19:21.923
on Cyril?

19:21.956 --> 19:24.227
Oh, shit.
man:

19:24.260 --> 19:26.465
Damn it.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.471
I should've
gone to therapy.

19:30.607 --> 19:31.609
Come on!

19:33.613 --> 19:35.349
Cyril?
Man,

19:35.383 --> 19:37.721
you know how to fill out
a dress in all the wrong ways.

19:37.755 --> 19:40.459
man:
The doctor comes with me.

19:40.493 --> 19:42.531
End of the line, Sterling.

19:42.564 --> 19:44.535
My mother
called me "Sterling."

19:44.568 --> 19:46.672
And you're not my mother.

19:46.706 --> 19:48.375
man: [grunts] No!

19:48.409 --> 19:50.881
Oh!
Was that a breakthrough?

19:50.914 --> 19:51.916
That felt like a breakthrough.

19:51.949 --> 19:53.686
It was gruesome.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.222
Breakthroughs
can be gruesome.

19:56.692 --> 19:59.632
Well, we made it.
- And got a new umbrella.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.569
- Deflection.
- Yeah, of darts,

20:01.602 --> 20:02.871
and your question.

20:02.905 --> 20:04.642
I know, it's just leaving--

20:04.675 --> 20:05.911
Would improve
your life forever.

20:05.944 --> 20:08.282
Sure, maybe, but also--

20:08.315 --> 20:10.352
You need me like oxygen?

20:10.386 --> 20:12.624
Mm, not
what I was gonna say, but--

20:12.658 --> 20:14.294
Oh, Sterling, listen.

20:14.327 --> 20:17.500
This life is damaging you--
a vicious cycle of violence

20:17.534 --> 20:19.839
leading to anger,
leading to more violence.

20:19.872 --> 20:22.678
We can start a new life,
running a little bakery

20:22.711 --> 20:23.980
on the banks of the Rhine

20:24.013 --> 20:26.418
that specializes
in Dampfnudel .

20:26.451 --> 20:27.721
You can bring things
into the world

20:27.755 --> 20:28.857
instead of taking them out.

20:28.890 --> 20:29.992
Or we can live
in Norway

20:30.025 --> 20:31.562
and give boat tours
on the fjords.

20:31.596 --> 20:33.432
No, no, no,
just the Rhine bakery,

20:33.465 --> 20:34.835
because that is the best one.

20:34.869 --> 20:36.506
That sounds
so compelling when you say it

20:36.539 --> 20:38.676
in that voice.

20:38.710 --> 20:40.914
Okay, yes.
I'll go.

20:40.947 --> 20:43.419
Hang on.

20:43.452 --> 20:46.559
So I'm leaving
definitely on this train,

20:46.592 --> 20:48.730
possibly forever.
- Wait, you're leaving

20:48.763 --> 20:50.332
with her?
- What do you care,

20:50.366 --> 20:51.969
Ms.
"I'm-Only-Here-To-Do-My-Job?"

20:52.003 --> 20:53.740
- Uh, Mrs.
- Sort of.

20:53.773 --> 20:55.276
And what I care about is

20:55.309 --> 20:56.879
how this would break
your mother's heart.

20:56.913 --> 20:58.850
This agency is her legacy.

20:58.883 --> 21:00.854
Well, maybe I've done
enough living for my mother.

21:00.887 --> 21:03.492
That is... actually healthy.

21:03.526 --> 21:05.029
You're right.
She's gone.

21:05.062 --> 21:06.966
But the rest of us
are still here.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.570
- Except Cheryl.
- And I know

21:08.603 --> 21:10.707
we're not perfect,
but we're your family--

21:10.740 --> 21:13.580
us, me, your daughter.

21:13.613 --> 21:16.017
Stay with us, because if you
think running away

21:16.051 --> 21:19.992
is the solution, I promise you,
you'll never stop running.

21:28.408 --> 21:29.879
Could've had
something there.

21:29.912 --> 21:32.751
- You have something here.
- Yeah, an erection.

21:32.784 --> 21:34.722
- What?
- I was gonna have train sex.

21:34.755 --> 21:35.790
Now what am I supposed to do

21:35.824 --> 21:37.460
with this, Lana?

21:37.493 --> 21:39.798
You'll figure it out.
- Like hell I will.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.036
This is someone else's problem.
- Okay, Archer.

21:42.069 --> 21:43.740
Ideally, two someones.

21:43.773 --> 21:46.011
- Okay, Archer!

22:05.550 --> 22:08.590
Made in Georgia.
