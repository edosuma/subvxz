WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:08.633
Cookies and cream?

00:08.675 --> 00:11.052
Hell, yes.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.858
- When was your birthday?
- This June.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.067
Sometime in June.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.070
- Sometime in June?
- Yeah.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.114
We don't know each other
that well yet.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.576
You're absolutely a Gemini,
I think.

00:34.617 --> 00:38.663
- That's--that is correct.
- I, uh...

00:41.875 --> 00:43.043
Mmm.

00:45.336 --> 00:46.463
Thank you.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.841
I mean, it's the least
I could do.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.259
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.635
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:52.677 --> 00:56.389
You're earning your stripes.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.767
- You crushed that.
- Mm, mm-hmm.

00:58.808 --> 01:03.646
Almost done.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.648
Mm.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.068
Your teeth--are your teeth
sensitive to cold?

01:08.109 --> 01:09.444
- Sometimes.
- Yeah?

01:09.486 --> 01:11.571
Yeah, it depends.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.119
Are you okay?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.496
Yeah.

01:22.373 --> 01:25.752
I feel weird, really weird.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.755
Probably just dehydrated
from the antibiotics.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.345
You're okay.
Oh, oh.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.347
Hello?

01:37.388 --> 01:38.431
You're good.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.975
- No.
- What's wrong?

01:46.815 --> 01:51.027
I think you're really,
really pretty.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.280
Ditto.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.167
Grab my hand.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.505
Grab my hand!

02:21.099 --> 02:23.101
What are you looking at?

02:51.337 --> 02:52.630
Damn.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.049
She's cute as shit, man.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.634
She's single?

02:56.676 --> 02:58.261
You don't want her.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.223
What is this,
like a life right situation?

03:02.265 --> 03:03.683
Sure.

03:05.059 --> 03:07.395
Meaning?

03:07.437 --> 03:10.857
Meaning Joyce just wants
to know everything there is

03:10.899 --> 03:12.859
to know about this girl.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.741
Tallulah Simms.

03:19.782 --> 03:23.203
How much you want to bet
that ain't her real name?

03:38.760 --> 03:42.222
What do you mean stand in?
That girl is a woman.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.182
Hey, hey!

03:52.857 --> 03:54.734
Why's your hand
all sweaty, Mama?

03:54.776 --> 03:57.445
Shh, this is the best part.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.923
Come in.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.987
I don't know
if this is appropriate.

04:42.031 --> 04:45.868
I know you've been
exploring egg donors.

04:50.039 --> 04:53.835
It might be an easier decision
if you knew the person.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.467
Sorry, that was...
that was weird.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.386
I shouldn't have said anything.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.475
I just know how much
you've been through.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.649
I would do that for you.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.163
I'm not really sure
what I want to do.

05:30.204 --> 05:33.082
Chef maybe...

05:33.124 --> 05:35.126
or high-end tattoo artist.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.128
My favorite food
was In-N-Out,

05:37.170 --> 05:39.213
but I don't eat meat anymore--
I'm trying not to.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.757
I ate it,
like, three months ago,

05:40.798 --> 05:43.676
but I'm really trying
not to do it anymore.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.304
I also like
"The Catcher in the Rye."

05:46.346 --> 05:49.432
I like to collect things...

05:51.976 --> 05:54.520
Shells...

05:54.562 --> 05:56.939
um, bracelets.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.946
You can't have a fucking kid.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.504
Lou...

07:01.546 --> 07:04.924
I've been thinking
about your offer.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.508
Predictions are we'll have
the number-one movie

07:47.550 --> 07:49.177
this week, putting us on track

07:49.218 --> 07:51.012
to make this our best year
in over a decade.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.513
And that's not
including "Chronicles,"

07:52.555 --> 07:54.724
which is testing
through the roof.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.601
Ideally, we'd like
to start reshoots

07:56.642 --> 07:58.102
on the 21st in order to make--

07:58.144 --> 07:59.270
- Pages?
- Good, not great.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.063
I have a set of notes.
I just need you to sign off.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.232
I trust you.
Just send them.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.193
That's all for now.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.709
That was impressive.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.336
I miss you.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.172
We should grab drinks.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.965
How is she anticipating
getting Redmond

08:28.007 --> 08:29.467
to sign off on those reshoots?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.760
We'll find a way.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.476
In what fucking universe

08:38.518 --> 08:40.895
would I approve
5 million for reshoots?

08:40.937 --> 08:42.480
We have a chance
to have critical

08:42.522 --> 08:43.731
and commercial success.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.776
I could give two flying fucks
for the critics.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.695
- Redmond.
- Not too short.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.323
You always cut them
too bloody short.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.533
- Redmond.
- Fuck!

08:53.574 --> 08:55.868
Get it right the first time!
That's what I pay you for.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.120
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Not you, dear.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.122
No, sorry. Her.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.004
Pretty funny seeing a woman
her age pregnant, huh?

09:11.759 --> 09:14.637
You're huge for three months.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.558
How much weight'd you put on?

09:25.147 --> 09:27.275
Fuck!

09:31.320 --> 09:33.990
I'm sorry.
Just leave it.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.662
You need to relax.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.205
The baby.

09:43.499 --> 09:47.670
Tell Meredith reshoots
aren't happening.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.672
I can do that.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.636
I could also kill him.

09:56.846 --> 10:01.183
Fall down a flight of stairs,
drive off the road.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.269
It's too easy.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.812
He needs a...

10:04.854 --> 10:07.315
a violent end.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.276
Dismembered and fed
down a garbage disposal?

10:10.318 --> 10:13.279
You're a sick girl.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.115
You should be working
for Blumhouse.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.162
I like where I am.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.879
You just need to relax.

10:35.509 --> 10:39.138
You have a little bit
of me inside you.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.271
I need a reservation for
tonight at Republique for two.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.940
I thought you weren't
doing dinners anymore.

10:51.525 --> 10:55.321
It's my 16th wedding
anniversary, Lou.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.823
My personal life is not

10:57.865 --> 11:01.911
for you to judge
or for me to justify.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.372
Of course.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.344
- You blinked.
- Sorry.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.183
Oh, my God,
you keep blinking.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.267
Sorry.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.900
Just don't blink.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.572
Please, don't move.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.036
Let's take a break.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.872
I'm almost done.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.651
Joyce should've been
the one to call me.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.487
She's running
a billion-dollar corporation.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.822
Mm.

12:19.864 --> 12:23.200
Not to mention...
she's pregnant.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.203
She's just a little busy.

12:26.245 --> 12:30.833
Says the intern
from Colorado Springs.

12:31.959 --> 12:35.546
She send you here
to do something else?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.090
Is there a room booked?

12:38.132 --> 12:39.467
Excuse me?

12:39.508 --> 12:41.761
Just because you stuck a
throat lozenge up your pussy--

12:41.802 --> 12:43.804
Careful.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.098
Or what?

12:46.140 --> 12:48.184
You made an amazing film.

12:48.225 --> 12:51.187
I'd hate
for your unsavory past--

12:51.228 --> 12:52.396
You came onto me.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.566
I was a 22-year-old intern
making minimum wage.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.860
You're a world-renowned author

12:57.902 --> 13:01.197
who just made
a $150 million film.

13:04.658 --> 13:07.119
I just want to take care
of this for Joyce,

13:07.161 --> 13:08.662
have you deliver the hit

13:08.704 --> 13:11.999
I know you're capable
of delivering.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.251
Sound like a plan?

13:15.544 --> 13:20.382
You need to get Joyce
and her little bitch in check.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.259
The Amish art chick intern

13:22.301 --> 13:24.136
is now overseeing
my fucking movie?

13:24.178 --> 13:26.639
She's not overseeing
the movie, Meredith--I am.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.517
You weren't the one going
down on me in the bathroom

13:29.558 --> 13:32.937
to get Joyce my fucking book.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.231
What are you talking about?

13:35.272 --> 13:37.149
Oh...

13:37.191 --> 13:39.860
Joyce never told you?

13:39.902 --> 13:42.947
What a fucking shit show!

13:51.664 --> 13:54.333
Jesus.
I thought you forgot about me.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.168
Shit takes time, bro.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.005
But I struck gold.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.386
April Mace?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.361
April?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.364
Little help!

14:25.406 --> 14:29.034
You can't hide
inside yourself forever.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.875
Full-blown breakdown.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.210
And then she shows up
in Hollywood,

14:38.252 --> 14:40.504
the Island of Misfit Toys.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.632
She blends in perfect with
all the other damaged goods.

14:43.674 --> 14:48.262
And poor Southern April Mace
reinvents herself.

14:48.971 --> 14:53.601
Removes all traces of her
old fucked-up identity...

14:53.642 --> 14:56.896
Tallulah "Lou" Simms,
and she ditches the accent.

14:56.937 --> 15:00.900
She gets an internship here
to target Joyce, her new mommy.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.068
I think you may have read
"Hollywood Babylon"

15:03.110 --> 15:05.112
too many times, mate.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.364
Fair enough.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.910
But the real problem,
Marty, is this.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.495
I found Alex's phone.
Nick hacked it.

15:13.537 --> 15:17.750
Guess where April was
the night Alex drowned.

15:17.791 --> 15:22.004
- She was with me.
- Not at 1:42 a.m.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.843
She also bought drugs

15:27.885 --> 15:29.011
the day before,

15:29.053 --> 15:31.764
the same shit they found
in Alex's body.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.602
Should I keep going?

15:40.147 --> 15:44.360
I've already shared all this
with the cops, so...

15:44.401 --> 15:47.196
You called
the fucking police?

15:47.237 --> 15:48.989
I kind of did.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.503
That feel good?

16:02.544 --> 16:05.214
I'll give you 100 bucks
for ten more minutes.

16:05.255 --> 16:09.009
Wow, 100 bucks.
You think I'm that cheap?

16:10.302 --> 16:12.054
You give me 125,
and I'll do it.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.098
What?

16:14.139 --> 16:15.641
Awful.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.017
Why are you so happy?

16:17.059 --> 16:19.645
I don't know.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.064
Bizarre, right?

16:22.106 --> 16:25.734
Second trimester
hormones maybe?

16:25.776 --> 16:28.946
You know, maybe it's because
you finally have it all.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.864
- Hmm?
- You got the job.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.574
You got the baby.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.743
And you got
the super-fucking-hot husband.

16:34.785 --> 16:38.455
Super fucking hot.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.541
Ugh.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.668
Don't, don't.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.795
Come on.
- Keep rubbing.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.756
I'll drop down to 75.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.216
Better be important.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.135
You sitting down?

16:52.302 --> 16:55.889
Excuse me, ma'am.
Excuse me.

16:55.931 --> 16:59.143
Excuse me, ma'am.
Sorry to bother you.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.646
Detective Witter from the LAPD.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.024
We need to speak to Lou Simms,

17:05.065 --> 17:08.235
also goes
by the name April Mace.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.571
- Uh, April Mace?
- Have you seen this woman?

17:10.612 --> 17:12.489
Uh, yes.
She lives here.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.283
What unit?

17:16.326 --> 17:18.579
I've changed all your
passcodes and contact info.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.372
Her keycard's
been deactivated.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.249
Everyone's on alert.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.751
She's just a kid.
There's no way.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.920
We need to distance ourselves
from this, from her.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.132
It's not possible.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.800
Joyce,
she's a murder suspect.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.218
She murdered Alex--
premeditation.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.220
Evidence is concrete.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.305
Miss Mace?

17:36.346 --> 17:38.766
It's Detective Witter
from the LAPD.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.023
The cops are gonna want
to sit down and speak with us.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.775
This whole thing is gonna
fucking blow up.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.485
No, it's not.

17:49.526 --> 17:53.697
She's just a nobody who maybe
killed another nobody.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.283
Keep your head in the game.

18:04.833 --> 18:08.670
Did you ever meet the girl
that worked for me--Lou Simms?

18:12.674 --> 18:14.927
Wanted for murder

19:12.901 --> 19:14.278
Do you have any comment

19:14.319 --> 19:16.280
on Lou Simms
being implicated in the death

19:16.321 --> 19:18.365
of your old assistant
Alex Butler?

19:20.909 --> 19:24.454
