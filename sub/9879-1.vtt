02:45.078 --> 02:47.444
- You suck, Gertrude.
- You suck.

02:47.514 --> 02:50.176
Yeah, I suck so bad I just skunked you.

02:50.250 --> 02:53.151
Which means, you gotta eat your pills.

02:53.220 --> 02:56.553
- You're supposed to be nice to me.
- I am nice to you.

02:56.923 --> 03:00.552
- It's not my fault you got no game.
- You suck, Travis.

03:03.597 --> 03:04.723
I know.

03:05.465 --> 03:07.194
Hey there, Travis.

03:07.901 --> 03:10.301
- I'll check on you later.
- All right.

03:11.638 --> 03:12.627
<i>Travis,</i>

03:14.241 --> 03:17.574
you've been talking about seeing the world

03:17.644 --> 03:19.976
the whole time you've been here.

03:21.314 --> 03:25.614
Think of it as an opportunity to
finally fulfill that.

03:25.886 --> 03:30.186
- Well, then you're firing me.
- Not firing, laying off.

03:30.257 --> 03:33.420
And I'm not laying you off,
the state is laying you off.

03:33.493 --> 03:35.154
All these budget cuts.

03:35.228 --> 03:37.423
They're clear-cutting the part-time positions.

03:37.497 --> 03:39.897
This has nothing to do with you.

03:39.966 --> 03:42.093
My advice, Travis, go see the world.

03:42.168 --> 03:44.932
Get that out of your system
like you've always wanted.

03:45.005 --> 03:47.132
Maybe you come back,
they may be hiring again.

03:47.207 --> 03:49.072
<i>- Home! Bring them home!</i>
<i>- Home! Bring them home!</i>

03:49.142 --> 03:51.542
- Bring them home!
- Bring them home!

03:51.611 --> 03:53.977
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

03:54.047 --> 03:56.277
- Bring them home! Bring them home!
- Bring them home! Bring them home!

03:56.349 --> 04:00.183
- I can't believe they fired me yesterday.
- Come on, man. It was a nursing home.

04:00.253 --> 04:03.279
- It's a retirement home.
- Yeah, that's what I said. A nursing home.

04:03.356 --> 04:04.755
It's better for the world than insurance.

04:04.824 --> 04:07.884
- Hey, I'm carrying a sign, aren't I?
- Great.

04:07.961 --> 04:10.088
Listen, not to get new-agey or nothing,

04:10.163 --> 04:12.757
but I think this is something that
was supposed to happen to you, you know?

04:12.832 --> 04:15.665
Force you out of your comfort zone,
make you mix it up a little bit.

04:15.735 --> 04:18.533
- I don't need to mix it up, I need to get paid.
- Get innovative then, man.

04:18.605 --> 04:20.163
Don't tell me you don't know how to do that.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.902
Back in college when you were
doing all that test subject shit.

04:22.976 --> 04:24.637
Selling your sperm.

04:25.178 --> 04:27.146
I never sold my sperm.

04:27.747 --> 04:32.116
'Cause nobody in their right mind
would pay for a piece of those genes.

04:32.419 --> 04:33.784
You know what?

04:33.853 --> 04:37.414
Whoever said peace rallies is
where the action is, doesn't know shit.

04:37.490 --> 04:41.290
- This is a fucking dyke-fest.
- Not all of them.

04:43.964 --> 04:45.454
No. Not happening.

04:49.536 --> 04:50.560
What's happening?

04:56.309 --> 04:59.335
- Hey. Hey!
- I got friends out there, you son of a bitch!

04:59.412 --> 05:01.778
- Fucking liberal pussy!
- Enough.

05:01.848 --> 05:03.873
- Get your fucking hands off me, man.
- Enough! Enough!

05:03.950 --> 05:06.384
Guys like me go over there
and die for a living.

05:06.453 --> 05:09.388
- Hey!
- Tee off, go ahead.

05:09.456 --> 05:13.153
It's your issue, man. It's your issue, man.
Not mine.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.984
Come on.

05:15.061 --> 05:16.221
- Hypocrite!
- Let's go.

05:16.296 --> 05:20.790
Fucking hypocrite! Go on!
Spread all your lies!

05:21.134 --> 05:24.365
You got a captive audience,
you fucking hippie liberal!

05:24.437 --> 05:27.634
Go on,
with all your propaganda and diatribes.

05:36.983 --> 05:38.177
Thanks.

05:38.718 --> 05:42.279
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

05:43.657 --> 05:45.358
I'm all right.

05:46.059 --> 05:49.722
My dad sat me down
and had me watch <i>Red Dawn</i>

05:49.796 --> 05:52.390
so that I would understand
just how bad things would get

05:52.465 --> 05:54.456
if the Communists took over.

05:55.001 --> 05:56.992
I sort of dug that flick.

05:58.505 --> 06:02.373
Then it was narco-traffickers,
Islamo-Fascists.

06:02.676 --> 06:06.043
Bad guys just keep changing their faces
and we keep going to war.

06:06.112 --> 06:08.478
- And then...
- We keep protesting.

06:09.315 --> 06:12.751
- United we stand.
- Cheers.

06:17.157 --> 06:19.352
This is a big moment, Travis.

06:21.428 --> 06:26.127
You've just witnessed
the last anti-war diatribe

06:26.199 --> 06:28.394
- the world's ever gonna hear from me.
- Wow.

06:28.468 --> 06:32.199
You know what I've realized?
Real war's in here.

06:32.806 --> 06:35.297
You just figured that out?

06:35.375 --> 06:38.037
No, I've known it for a while.

06:38.111 --> 06:42.047
- But I'm finally gonna do something about it.
- And what's that?

06:44.417 --> 06:46.214
I'm going to India.

06:47.020 --> 06:49.386
I figure I'll do some yoga,

06:49.456 --> 06:51.947
some time in an ashram,

06:52.025 --> 06:53.925
have sex with my guru.

06:58.131 --> 07:00.793
We'll both agree afterwards that
it was a mistake, of course.

07:00.867 --> 07:02.425
Of course.

07:06.272 --> 07:09.901
Maybe you should go. We could meet up.

07:09.976 --> 07:14.913
Well, a trip like that
would be a pretty penny,

07:14.981 --> 07:17.449
- which I don't got.
- Could knock over a liquor store.

07:19.285 --> 07:22.516
I think I could come up with something
slightly more legit.

07:23.490 --> 07:24.821
Such as?

07:25.058 --> 07:26.855
You don't wanna know.

07:28.261 --> 07:29.853
I think I can handle it.

07:29.929 --> 07:33.558
I mean, I think I'm intellectually
limber enough.

07:35.635 --> 07:37.398
Can I see you again?

08:16.676 --> 08:19.668
- Michael Barris.
- Travis, hey.

08:21.915 --> 08:24.816
- Smart man.
- What?

08:26.052 --> 08:29.419
- You wore a suit. That's a smart move.
- Yeah.

08:29.489 --> 08:33.152
- I heard there's not many spots.
- Do I need to sign here or print my name?

08:33.226 --> 08:36.092
- Just a signature will do.
- Thanks, boo. Love the jacket.

08:38.765 --> 08:41.495
We are strangers in a strange land, brother.

08:43.369 --> 08:46.532
First off, what we will be doing here,
for those of you that don't know,

08:46.606 --> 08:50.770
will be a behavioral experiment,
in which we will be simulating

08:50.844 --> 08:53.972
the conditions of life
inside a state penitentiary.

08:54.047 --> 08:57.312
Now, our only requirement is that
none of you have ever served any time.

08:57.383 --> 08:59.783
If you have, we'd like to
thank you for your interest,

08:59.853 --> 09:01.548
but you do not fit our profile.

09:01.621 --> 09:04.818
Now, we will be conducting
a short series of tests in a moment,

09:04.891 --> 09:06.984
but before we do
I would just like to take a beat

09:07.060 --> 09:10.461
and let you know that
although the actual experiment

09:10.530 --> 09:13.260
will be conducted
in an utterly secure environment

09:13.333 --> 09:16.325
and the participants will be safe at all times,

09:16.402 --> 09:19.667
some of the subjects
will be deprived of their civil rights...

09:19.739 --> 09:22.037
- It's a flying man.
...for the entire two weeks.

09:22.108 --> 09:24.338
What's his name?

09:24.410 --> 09:28.574
- Flying Man.
- Now, let's get to the tests, shall we?

09:29.249 --> 09:31.649
- No history of incarceration?
- No.

09:33.052 --> 09:35.213
- Violence?
- No.

09:35.455 --> 09:37.980
- Never?
- No.

09:40.693 --> 09:44.220
- What about religion?
- No.

09:45.198 --> 09:49.225
No? Religion's not usually
a yes or no question, Mr. Hunt.

09:49.302 --> 09:53.363
People tend to find all sorts of gray areas
in which to couch their answers.

09:53.439 --> 09:55.600
Well, nothing gray here.

09:55.875 --> 09:58.810
So, how do you base
your ethical decisions, then?

10:01.848 --> 10:02.837
Here.

10:03.917 --> 10:07.580
I was in Boy Scouts,
and drill team in high school,

10:10.123 --> 10:11.283
various church groups.

10:11.357 --> 10:14.155
- You were devout, then?
- Still am.

10:14.894 --> 10:18.455
And what about
absolute right and wrong in the universe?

10:22.735 --> 10:24.600
Well, I guess,

10:26.239 --> 10:31.404
if I believe in God,
then I would have to, right?

10:32.045 --> 10:35.037
Yeah, you know, I only got three rules,

10:35.114 --> 10:39.676
eat twat, smoke pot, and smile a lot.

10:45.325 --> 10:47.384
It's just a short slide-show
we'd like you to watch.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.792
It's perfectly safe, I assure you.

11:02.709 --> 11:05.701
<i>The sheriff's deputies had escorted</i>
<i>Duceppe back to Baton Rouge.</i>

11:05.778 --> 11:08.906
<i>I am convinced that</i>
<i>when these animals are herded together</i>

11:08.982 --> 11:10.609
<i>their instincts warn them of...</i>

11:11.284 --> 11:13.616
<i>... California hotel, where FBI agents...</i>

12:00.266 --> 12:04.100
- Are you okay to move on, Mr. Hunt?
- Yep. I'm good.

12:29.495 --> 12:31.520
You wouldn't have hit him.

12:32.665 --> 12:33.654
Who?

12:35.001 --> 12:36.798
The guy at the rally.

12:39.672 --> 12:41.970
You wouldn't have hit him.

12:43.342 --> 12:46.641
These knuckles, they're pristine.

12:49.649 --> 12:51.674
- You calling me a pussy?
- Yeah.

12:55.421 --> 12:58.913
- It's a compliment.
- Cool.

13:02.128 --> 13:05.188
I'll be gone by the time
you get out, you know.

13:06.299 --> 13:07.493
I know.

13:19.512 --> 13:23.004
Dashashwamedh Ghat, Varanasi.

13:24.784 --> 13:28.515
- Varanasi.
- How soon can you be there?

13:30.623 --> 13:33.786
Twelfth? Thirteenth?

13:34.360 --> 13:35.827
Thirteenth.

13:36.729 --> 13:40.893
Dashashwamedh Ghat on the 13th, 6:00 p.m.

13:46.272 --> 13:49.435
- Hey, you made it.
- Good to see you.

13:49.509 --> 13:51.739
- Yeah.
- I was hoping I'd have someone to talk to.

13:53.713 --> 13:57.240
I can't help but think that
this says something about us.

13:58.050 --> 13:59.915
I think it says we need money.

14:04.557 --> 14:07.549
- Sorry.
- Hey, how's it going?

14:20.673 --> 14:23.972
- It's the beginning.
- Game on.

14:25.077 --> 14:28.444
So let's move on to the topic of women.
What's that word mean to you?

14:28.514 --> 14:30.004
Women? What?

14:41.327 --> 14:43.761
Everything on God's green earth

14:43.829 --> 14:47.390
and possibly beyond what's been
discovered in our universe yet?

14:47.466 --> 14:48.490
I don't know.

15:05.718 --> 15:09.017
<i>Look, it's only a dog.</i>
<i>So, what're you worried about?</i>

15:09.088 --> 15:11.022
<i>Worried? Who's worried?</i>
<i>I'm only worried about you.</i>

15:11.090 --> 15:14.116
<i>Look, I'll stay here and protect the car,</i>
<i>and you go take a look.</i>

15:20.766 --> 15:24.133
Hey, chickenshit, we got a draft!

15:25.504 --> 15:27.836
Didn't you hear me, chickenshit?

15:28.641 --> 15:31.132
We got a draft. Close the window!

16:16.789 --> 16:18.518
I fell asleep. How far did we drive?

16:25.064 --> 16:26.964
This is a fucking spot.

16:28.367 --> 16:31.359
Gentlemen, they're waiting inside.

16:31.437 --> 16:35.100
You mind if I just grab my bag?
There's some stuff in there that I need.

16:35.174 --> 16:38.302
You'll have everything you need inside.

16:52.191 --> 16:54.091
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.221
The next two weeks
will be a new experience for you.

16:58.898 --> 17:02.334
Now as I said before,
some of you will have no civil rights.

17:02.535 --> 17:04.969
Do not underestimate that.

17:05.604 --> 17:08.732
If any of you wanna leave,
now is your last chance.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.566
No?

17:14.847 --> 17:16.439
Good.

17:16.515 --> 17:19.780
Again, your safety is
our number one priority.

17:19.852 --> 17:22.945
If there is any violence, any at all,

17:23.021 --> 17:26.355
the experiment
will be immediately terminated.

17:26.759 --> 17:27.919
Clear?

17:28.260 --> 17:30.956
Now, when I call your name, please stand.

17:31.030 --> 17:33.828
Dernier, Bosch,

17:34.667 --> 17:38.194
Helweg, Sandberg,

17:39.705 --> 17:43.141
Chase, and Barris.

17:46.078 --> 17:47.102
Good.

17:47.179 --> 17:51.275
So the rest of you,
please stand up and follow the yellow line.

17:53.953 --> 17:56.444
- Later, pal.
- Good luck, gentlemen. And I thank you.

18:01.660 --> 18:05.187
So what do you think, Girl Scouts?
Prisoners or guards?

18:07.566 --> 18:09.227
I think we just got our answer.

18:12.471 --> 18:15.702
Nothing is to come or go from the cell block.

18:15.775 --> 18:17.902
Nothing from the outside world.

18:18.244 --> 18:22.340
If you look in your lockers,
you will see a printout with the five rules

18:22.415 --> 18:24.747
that the prisoners are to follow at all times.

18:24.817 --> 18:26.580
Please read them aloud with me.

18:26.852 --> 18:28.319
"Rule number one:

18:28.387 --> 18:32.949
"Prisoners must eat three meals a day
and all food must be consumed.

18:33.025 --> 18:36.051
"Two: There will be 30 minutes of rec daily.

18:36.128 --> 18:41.191
"Three: Prisoners are allowed only
in prisoner-designated areas.

18:41.267 --> 18:45.294
"Four: Prisoners must speak
only when spoken to.

18:45.371 --> 18:51.071
"And five: Prisoners must not touch
the guards under any circumstances."

18:51.777 --> 18:55.770
Those that break the rules
must be punished commensurately.

18:56.382 --> 18:58.043
What does "commensurate" mean?

18:58.918 --> 19:01.819
This experiment is not about individuals.

19:01.887 --> 19:04.651
If any one person leaves, it's over.

19:04.723 --> 19:06.691
If a prisoner does break the rules,

19:06.759 --> 19:10.320
you will have 30 minutes to choose
proper disciplinary action.

19:10.396 --> 19:13.388
If you fail to do so,
that red light will come on,

19:13.466 --> 19:17.300
the experiment will be terminated,
and you will not get paid.

19:18.170 --> 19:21.037
- What did you say?
- You either maintain strict order,

19:21.106 --> 19:23.267
or you don't get paid.

19:23.943 --> 19:26.070
I will see you in two weeks.

19:46.232 --> 19:48.894
- Sorry, man.
- For what?

19:49.602 --> 19:51.627
- All this.
- Don't sweat it.

19:54.006 --> 19:56.497
All right, turn around. Gotta do the front.

19:56.575 --> 19:58.839
What? Nobody else had to turn around.

19:58.911 --> 20:00.845
What's the problem, Boy George,

20:00.913 --> 20:03.404
you afraid we gonna see that
you got no dick?

20:03.482 --> 20:06.383
- Fuck you.
- Hey, man. Quit being a fag, huh?

20:07.920 --> 20:09.387
Maybe if we drop the soap...

20:10.956 --> 20:14.414
All right, girls. Everyone on the line!

20:14.994 --> 20:18.122
- Which one?
- I don't know.

20:19.798 --> 20:21.993
That one. That line.

20:24.203 --> 20:26.034
- How you doing?
- Gotta be honest,

20:26.105 --> 20:29.768
you guys are the most suck-ass guards
I've ever seen.

20:33.345 --> 20:36.746
Yeah, well, you can blow me
and the entire state of Kentucky.

20:37.583 --> 20:38.777
Kentucky?

20:40.019 --> 20:41.680
All right, look, we gotta stop fucking around

20:41.754 --> 20:44.279
or they might end this thing
before it even begins.

20:45.057 --> 20:47.457
I didn't come all the way out here
not to get paid.

20:49.562 --> 20:53.931
"From now on inmates will be addressed
only by their inmate numbers."

20:54.333 --> 20:55.891
That's awesome.

20:58.537 --> 20:59.526
Wow.

20:59.805 --> 21:02.672
The only other thing
that you girls need to know

21:02.741 --> 21:08.976
is, "Prisoners will find cell assignments
attached to each cell."

21:09.848 --> 21:13.409
- Are we supposed to do that?
- Yes, Tinker Bell.

21:13.485 --> 21:14.577
- Now?
- Yes.

21:15.287 --> 21:17.619
Now run along. Run along, find your homes.

21:17.690 --> 21:19.419
- Okay.
- Going.

21:19.491 --> 21:22.517
- Okay, guys...
- This ain't a love-in. Get moving.

21:22.995 --> 21:25.429
Waiting for a bus? Come on!

21:30.836 --> 21:32.997
Hey, Travis.

21:38.677 --> 21:40.076
Seventeen.

21:41.180 --> 21:42.545
Seventy-seven.

21:47.953 --> 21:52.219
Wow, I feel dangerous
just wearing this outfit.

21:52.825 --> 21:54.622
- You look dangerous.
- Oh, yeah.

21:54.693 --> 21:57.628
Yeah, you are massively
messing with me, right?

21:57.696 --> 21:59.095
- No.
- No?

21:59.999 --> 22:02.490
- Benjy Putterman.
- How you doing? Travis.

22:02.835 --> 22:03.824
Novelist.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.840
- Novelist, huh?
- Graphic novelist, actually.

22:13.612 --> 22:17.309
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

22:18.150 --> 22:21.608
Oh, my God, I'm gonna get so much material
from this place.

22:21.687 --> 22:24.986
- This is ripping!
- Yeah.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.294
Ripping.

22:29.695 --> 22:32.459
So, what drew you to this experiment?

22:34.466 --> 22:36.195
Cash-dollars.

22:36.702 --> 22:37.964
My mother.

22:39.304 --> 22:41.534
It was her idea?

22:43.475 --> 22:44.840
She broke her hip,

22:46.378 --> 22:47.868
I needed to pay the rent.

22:47.946 --> 22:49.436
Do you live with your mother?

22:49.782 --> 22:50.874
Yes.

22:51.950 --> 22:53.713
And how old are you?

22:54.953 --> 22:56.011
Forty-two.

22:56.655 --> 22:59.317
So, what drew you
to this experiment, Mr. Chase?

22:59.391 --> 23:02.383
Pussy. Pussy drew me to the experiment.

23:02.628 --> 23:05.597
It's a male-only experiment, Mr. Chase.

23:05.664 --> 23:09.065
It's the pussy I'm gonna get
with the 14 grand once I'm done.

23:09.134 --> 23:11.034
How many sexual partners have you had?

23:13.839 --> 23:16.239
I lost track when I was, like, 17.

23:16.842 --> 23:19.072
Were they male or female?

23:19.945 --> 23:21.037
Female.

23:21.613 --> 23:24.639
So, what drew you to
this experiment, Mr. Nix?

23:24.883 --> 23:27.477
I'm just trying to make an honest buck, man.

23:28.554 --> 23:29.543
Escape.

23:30.656 --> 23:32.317
Come on, you big boy.

23:32.825 --> 23:34.349
Throw it down.

23:38.130 --> 23:39.722
Seventy-seven.

23:39.932 --> 23:41.695
- Flying Man?
- No.

23:42.468 --> 23:43.901
You guys go ahead.

23:43.969 --> 23:46.301
Oh, hell no. These knees are busted.

23:47.272 --> 23:49.331
Hey, how about it, redwood? Throw it down?

23:53.011 --> 23:54.740
- Wait.
- Oh, my God. Is he okay?

23:57.349 --> 24:00.648
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck.

24:01.553 --> 24:03.885
- Bosch, you all right?
- I'm all right.

24:03.989 --> 24:06.457
- Let's get you out of here.
- I thought he was looking.

24:07.159 --> 24:08.649
- Come on.
- I did.

24:09.461 --> 24:12.362
- You all right, big man. You all right.
- It's all right. It was an accident.

24:13.198 --> 24:14.358
It's all right.

24:19.204 --> 24:22.367
What the fuck was that guy thinking, huh?

24:22.441 --> 24:25.376
I'm okay. I'm okay. He didn't mean it.

24:25.911 --> 24:28.141
- Sure you're all right?
- It's just a bloody nose.

24:28.747 --> 24:31.648
Let's just go back to work. Please.

24:33.152 --> 24:35.620
I don't know.

24:35.687 --> 24:39.179
- I think we gotta do something.
- What are you talking about?

24:39.258 --> 24:42.125
I'm talking about rule number five.

24:43.495 --> 24:45.087
Prisoners are not supposed to touch us.

24:45.864 --> 24:50.324
Well, technically, he didn't touch us.
The ball did.

24:50.569 --> 24:52.400
Look at your face, man.

24:53.872 --> 24:57.330
I mean, we all heard what they said.
We gotta keep the order.

24:57.910 --> 25:00.401
Respond commensurately.

25:02.047 --> 25:05.380
They saw it. They know it was an accident.

25:05.784 --> 25:09.618
- I agree.
- Are you sure about that?

25:10.722 --> 25:13.054
Look, I just don't want that light
to come on in 30 minutes

25:13.125 --> 25:15.059
because we didn't do what
we were supposed to do.

25:15.127 --> 25:17.687
- I got 14 grand on the line.
- Yeah, we all got 14 grand on the line.

25:17.763 --> 25:19.492
Come on.

25:20.399 --> 25:23.197
We're not talking about
crucifying the man here.

25:24.770 --> 25:28.262
The word's commensurate.

25:29.041 --> 25:31.066
Which means,

25:31.143 --> 25:34.579
if what the man did was small potatoes,

25:36.215 --> 25:38.308
we respond in kind.

25:38.383 --> 25:41.216
Small potatoes for small potatoes.

25:41.887 --> 25:43.286
Either that,

25:44.990 --> 25:47.458
or we wait till that light goes on.

25:54.299 --> 25:57.291
Push-ups, ten.

25:58.403 --> 26:00.234
Do them now.

26:01.607 --> 26:04.770
I just need a little civility, that's all.

26:05.978 --> 26:08.469
It was an accident.

26:14.720 --> 26:18.417
This is not a fucking negotiation.
Do the push-ups.

26:19.725 --> 26:23.320
Just a little civility, brother. Just a little.

26:26.865 --> 26:31.165
All right, everyone, ten push-ups.

26:37.643 --> 26:40.544
You heard the man. Let's go.

26:41.179 --> 26:44.444
Do it! Come on, do it!

26:44.816 --> 26:46.340
Yeah, follow your little brother.

26:48.487 --> 26:50.045
There we are.

26:50.856 --> 26:51.948
Count them out.

26:52.024 --> 26:55.289
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

26:55.360 --> 26:58.329
...four, five, six...
...four, five, six...

26:58.397 --> 27:02.094
...seven, eight, nine, ten.
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

27:02.167 --> 27:06.570
What did that tell you, huh?
Tater Tots for Tater Tots.

27:07.172 --> 27:09.640
And you, you ought to be a cop, dude.

27:10.008 --> 27:12.875
- Looked more like a drill sergeant to me.
- Yeah.

27:12.945 --> 27:15.379
Like that guy out of <i>Full Metal Jacket.</i>

27:15.447 --> 27:18.416
- "Give me 20, maggot!"
- Fuck you.

27:18.483 --> 27:21.043
I'm almost embarrassed for them,
to be honest.

27:21.119 --> 27:23.679
You know, stepping and fetching like that.

27:26.224 --> 27:27.486
Has it been 30 minutes yet?

27:29.227 --> 27:30.592
Just.

27:37.336 --> 27:39.429
I guess we got our verdict.

27:41.907 --> 27:43.772
I'm not mad, you know?

27:44.509 --> 27:45.806
At them.

27:46.878 --> 27:50.780
They keep making us do push-ups like this,
we'll be all swoll.

27:51.483 --> 27:52.848
All of us are.

27:52.918 --> 27:55.944
You know, get paid and get in shape.

27:56.922 --> 28:00.119
- You got a girl, 17?
- No.

28:00.292 --> 28:01.281
What about you?

28:04.262 --> 28:06.594
- I'm at the start of something.
- Yeah?

28:06.832 --> 28:08.231
Me too. Feels good, doesn't it?

28:09.101 --> 28:11.831
- Good and bad.
- Mine's a barista.

28:13.405 --> 28:15.464
Wouldn't think a guy like me
could pull a barista, would you?

28:15.540 --> 28:17.303
What exactly do you write, anyway?

28:18.310 --> 28:20.972
- Comics.
- Graphic novels.

28:21.279 --> 28:23.804
Yeah, <i>Flying Man's</i> my next big launch.

28:23.882 --> 28:25.042
<i>- Flying Man?</i>
- Yep.

28:25.984 --> 28:28.509
The man who flies.

28:29.454 --> 28:32.446
- What's he do besides fly?
- See that?

28:32.657 --> 28:35.820
What you just said,
"What else he do besides fly?"

28:35.894 --> 28:39.557
That's how jaded people have become.
We're talking about flying here.

28:39.631 --> 28:42.964
Like a human being, actually flying.

28:43.068 --> 28:46.731
And no cape, nothing.
Just flying, you know?

28:46.872 --> 28:49.033
Like you or me in this cell
just kind of taking off

28:49.107 --> 28:51.803
like nothing could limit us.
Like we could just go, go, go.

28:51.943 --> 28:54.343
Tell me, honestly,
who is not gonna want to read that?

28:54.579 --> 28:58.037
I shouldn't be talking about this anyway.
My agent would kill me if he knew I was.

28:58.116 --> 29:00.277
- You got an agent, huh?
- Yeah, couple.

29:00.352 --> 29:02.616
How you like that, 77?

29:02.687 --> 29:06.020
Looks like we got a heavy hitter
in the box with us.

29:07.592 --> 29:08.854
Yeah, we do.

29:09.461 --> 29:13.090
9:00, ladies! Lights out!

29:53.105 --> 29:55.733
- Really, come on.
- What?

29:56.475 --> 30:00.309
- What is it?
- Move along, fuck-butt.

30:02.614 --> 30:05.981
Yum, yum, come on, people. Move along!

30:46.825 --> 30:48.952
Hey, hey, hey. You gotta clean your plate.

30:50.595 --> 30:51.926
Come on, man. That's not gonna happen.

30:53.532 --> 30:55.762
What are you?
Spokesman for the union now?

30:55.901 --> 30:57.493
Look, nobody's trying to be difficult.

30:57.569 --> 31:01.005
We'll eat everything else, just not that.

31:01.206 --> 31:04.403
I mean, look at it.
It literally might be dog shit.

31:12.017 --> 31:14.747
It's beans. Come on, eat them.

31:16.154 --> 31:17.451
Come on, guys.

31:17.522 --> 31:19.820
It's not like I'm being
unreasonable here, right?

31:19.891 --> 31:22.485
I mean, we got rules, okay?

31:22.561 --> 31:25.860
Rule number one:
You gotta clean your plate.

31:25.931 --> 31:28.559
Rule number six says,
"You gotta eat dog shit."

31:28.633 --> 31:30.897
It's not dog shit.

31:32.537 --> 31:34.061
It's dog shit.

31:35.874 --> 31:39.708
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause you gotta eat it anyway.

31:39.778 --> 31:42.406
Okay, I'm gonna just...
Oh, my God. My dog shit!

31:43.548 --> 31:45.607
You fucking shit. Out of there.

31:45.684 --> 31:49.176
Look, okay, memo to Adolf,
uniform's not real. Okay, baby?

31:49.254 --> 31:51.586
Hey, <i>Moulin Rouge,</i> you gotta eat it.

31:52.057 --> 31:55.049
Nobody's leaving here
until their plates are clean.

31:55.927 --> 31:57.986
You heard the man, huh?

32:00.131 --> 32:01.962
The word is clean.

32:06.571 --> 32:09.233
- Clean? Is that the word?
- Yeah.

32:13.178 --> 32:14.406
Now it's clean.

32:19.618 --> 32:21.813
He just earned you guys
some more push-ups.

32:22.187 --> 32:25.816
Push-ups. You heard the man! Push-ups!

32:25.890 --> 32:28.290
I'll give you push-ups. Push this up!

32:34.599 --> 32:38.262
Complete wrong move, ass-licker.

32:40.505 --> 32:41.836
Step back!

32:48.813 --> 32:53.409
- You shouldn't have done that!
- Keep it up, girls. Get it out of your system.

32:53.685 --> 32:56.210
That's right, you goose-stepping pussy!

32:56.288 --> 32:59.018
I will see you girls tonight.

32:59.124 --> 33:02.025
Feel the wrath of Flying Man!

33:02.994 --> 33:04.120
Flying Man?

33:09.334 --> 33:10.323
Yeah.

33:10.702 --> 33:15.139
This is our house, bitches!
This is our house!

33:15.707 --> 33:19.473
Only reason,
only fucking reason they did that

33:19.544 --> 33:23.241
was 'cause they knew
they weren't gonna get their asses kicked.

33:23.315 --> 33:27.445
You take away someone's fear
of getting punched in the fucking mouth,

33:28.653 --> 33:30.644
all of a sudden,
they're the biggest cocksuckers

33:30.722 --> 33:32.587
on the fucking planet.

33:33.191 --> 33:36.490
That may be true, but the rules are the rules.

33:36.561 --> 33:37.926
We don't use violence.

33:43.401 --> 33:44.993
Well, we obviously gotta do something.

33:45.070 --> 33:48.631
I mean, we are being tested
just as much as they are.

33:48.707 --> 33:51.835
They made me look like a fucking pussy
is what they did.

33:52.243 --> 33:53.335
Yeah.

33:53.945 --> 33:55.537
I got an idea.

33:57.282 --> 34:00.547
I pledged for a fraternity once.

34:00.819 --> 34:03.583
And during Hell Week, the brothers,

34:04.422 --> 34:06.151
they would break down our will.

34:06.291 --> 34:09.920
They would try to humble us
for the initiation that was gonna come.

34:10.527 --> 34:14.190
I mean, the rules,
they were pretty much the same as here.

34:14.264 --> 34:16.927
I mean, they couldn't hurt us.

34:17.668 --> 34:20.194
But they could do something much worse,

34:21.639 --> 34:23.630
they could humiliate us.

34:27.011 --> 34:29.138
That's what we have to do.

34:32.250 --> 34:35.879
Is we have to humiliate them.

34:59.110 --> 35:01.135
What? What are you doing?

35:10.221 --> 35:15.056
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- That is for inciting them.

35:15.126 --> 35:17.390
- What? What are you talking about?
- Shut up.

35:17.729 --> 35:21.563
You need to shut up. All right?

35:30.608 --> 35:34.601
There will be no more incidents

35:35.613 --> 35:37.410
like there was today.

35:38.516 --> 35:40.245
Is that understood?

35:42.454 --> 35:45.514
I said, is that understood?

35:46.024 --> 35:47.719
- Yes.
- Yes.

35:47.792 --> 35:50.818
Yes, what? 'Cause I can't hear you.

35:51.196 --> 35:53.426
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

36:01.372 --> 36:04.739
Who's the bitches now, bitches?

36:08.012 --> 36:11.209
Great job, guys. Great job.

36:11.883 --> 36:13.510
- Dude, I...
- Great job.

36:15.887 --> 36:19.755
- Nice speech.
- Good job, good job.

36:20.592 --> 36:22.560
I'll catch up later.

37:34.198 --> 37:37.463
Excuse me? Excuse me?

37:40.071 --> 37:44.599
I'm having heat flashes.
I think my blood sugar is low.

37:47.712 --> 37:50.772
Capote, just shut the fuck up, okay?

37:55.486 --> 37:58.944
- What are you talking about, man?
- I'm having low blood sugar.

37:59.991 --> 38:03.518
If I gotta say "Shut the fuck up"
one more time...

38:15.974 --> 38:17.464
You all right?

38:30.755 --> 38:34.122
Okay, everybody's had their fun.

38:39.931 --> 38:42.559
I'm gonna suggest

38:43.601 --> 38:46.069
that we act like gentlemen
for the rest of the way.

38:46.337 --> 38:48.100
That we play by the rules

38:50.341 --> 38:52.639
these last 11 days.

38:53.578 --> 38:56.877
And everybody can go home happily
with their money.

38:58.850 --> 39:00.477
How's that sound?

39:11.295 --> 39:12.694
Where is 51?

39:16.634 --> 39:18.295
Where's 51?

39:22.907 --> 39:24.397
Let's go.

39:30.214 --> 39:31.943
I need sugar.

39:33.985 --> 39:37.216
Look, diabetic.
Says he's diabetic on his application.

39:37.288 --> 39:39.654
So he needs insulin, that's what it is.

39:39.724 --> 39:42.887
No, no, no. Look.
It says he regulates it through diet.

39:43.961 --> 39:46.452
Yeah, man, it's in his own words.

39:46.564 --> 39:48.964
He's the one that filled this out.

39:51.636 --> 39:54.434
This is not a big deal. It's not.

39:54.505 --> 39:56.735
I mean, my fucking grandma
has basically the same thing,

39:56.808 --> 39:58.833
and she just gets moody in between meals.

39:58.910 --> 40:01.936
Trust me, this is not a big deal.

40:03.548 --> 40:05.743
Fifty-one, you need to get up.

40:05.817 --> 40:07.910
Let's go, come on. Get up.

40:07.985 --> 40:09.543
Hey, I wanna do this.

40:09.721 --> 40:13.054
I do. I just need a Twix bar.

40:13.124 --> 40:14.955
There's one in my bag if you can find it.

40:15.026 --> 40:17.790
Twix bar. Is that what you wanna eat?

40:20.331 --> 40:23.061
Get him up. Get him up. Come on. Come on!

40:23.701 --> 40:26.226
- Are you kidding me?
- You're all right.

40:28.406 --> 40:32.342
- Hey, why don't you let the man be?
- You know the rules, 77.

40:32.410 --> 40:35.208
All prisoners must participate in rec.

40:35.279 --> 40:39.545
And you do not address me
unless I have spoken to you first.

40:40.284 --> 40:42.149
The man... Look at him.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.153
The man can't do it.

40:51.295 --> 40:56.130
You do understand that
this is a prison experiment, right?

40:56.334 --> 40:57.824
Yes.

40:57.902 --> 41:02.703
And you do understand
the roles that we've been given?

41:03.174 --> 41:06.143
- Obviously.
- You are a prisoner.

41:08.479 --> 41:12.677
You don't give orders, we give orders.

41:14.152 --> 41:16.780
Have I made myself completely clear
to you now?

41:19.824 --> 41:24.158
Let the man lie down.

41:30.768 --> 41:33.931
Do I need to escalate matters right now?

41:35.373 --> 41:37.273
Is that what I should do?

41:39.177 --> 41:40.872
What is that supposed to mean?

41:41.345 --> 41:45.213
It means that you won't shut up.

41:47.251 --> 41:51.915
And I am trying to figure out
how I'm supposed to deal with that.

41:54.926 --> 41:58.828
- Why don't you try being rational?
- How is this for rational?

41:58.896 --> 42:00.261
Do I look rational now? Do I?

42:00.331 --> 42:01.958
- Let's put the sugar in him real quick, man.
- Put it away.

42:02.033 --> 42:03.057
Do I look rational now?

42:03.134 --> 42:07.127
You hit me and the experiment is over.

42:08.406 --> 42:10.897
You know that and I know that.

42:12.577 --> 42:14.738
Easy now, brother. Come on.

42:14.812 --> 42:16.575
Okay. It's okay.

42:16.647 --> 42:19.377
All right, everyone, back in their cell.

42:19.717 --> 42:21.981
Let's go, guards!
Get them back in their cells!

42:22.053 --> 42:23.850
- Let's go.
- Get in!

42:24.622 --> 42:25.611
I don't need an escort.

42:28.626 --> 42:30.890
This ain't right! I ain't playing that shit.

42:30.962 --> 42:32.259
Go. Move!

43:07.298 --> 43:09.596
<i>What do you think they want from us?</i>

43:11.435 --> 43:14.302
Why would you run a prison experiment?

43:17.041 --> 43:19.168
Throw some animals in a cage

43:19.844 --> 43:23.712
and you get to find out which one
of us is gonna be the lions

43:24.282 --> 43:26.773
and which ones are gonna get gut.

43:27.351 --> 43:33.347
I like to think we're slightly higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys.

43:33.658 --> 43:37.094
It don't matter how evolved you think we are.

43:37.161 --> 43:41.791
You lock up any animal long enough
and the strong's gonna eat the weak.

43:42.033 --> 43:43.762
That's just the way it is.

43:48.172 --> 43:50.003
You learn that in prison, 17?

43:53.978 --> 43:56.845
- You must think I'm somebody else, slick.
- No.

43:56.914 --> 44:00.145
Just that tattoo you got there is an Aryan tat,

44:00.217 --> 44:03.744
so I figured, you know,
you probably got that in the pen.

44:09.894 --> 44:12.192
Expert in the penitentiary system,
are you, boy?

44:12.797 --> 44:15.823
I just watch a lot of Discovery Channel.

44:15.900 --> 44:20.166
You will not interfere
with my ability to make a paycheck.

44:23.140 --> 44:24.664
You understand?

44:26.978 --> 44:30.379
We're cool. No sweat.

44:36.821 --> 44:39.551
So, what were you in for anyway?

44:44.261 --> 44:48.630
- Did you really just ask me that?
- Yeah. I just asked you that.

44:50.201 --> 44:53.466
- You better pump your brakes, boy.
- Oh, yeah?

44:54.438 --> 44:57.771
- Why's that?
- Lf you don't start respecting the guards,

44:58.342 --> 45:00.867
you're gonna have a serious problem.

45:03.147 --> 45:06.014
- They're not guards.
- No, they're guards all right.

45:06.350 --> 45:09.911
And them up there,
they're getting exactly what they want.

45:13.824 --> 45:16.622
I suggest you stop protecting your friend.

45:17.628 --> 45:18.993
What's right is right, man.

45:19.063 --> 45:22.089
Last thing a man wants to be in the pen
is right.

45:22.266 --> 45:23.494
Dudes, they...

45:24.101 --> 45:27.468
They start digging in
and getting all righteous then.

45:28.539 --> 45:32.839
That only leads to one place.
Go along to get along, man.

45:33.377 --> 45:38.144
Whatever fire you got in your belly,
you're best to let it go.

45:39.717 --> 45:40.945
Trust me.

45:42.653 --> 45:44.018
Let it go.

45:44.655 --> 45:45.723
<i>All I know</i>

45:47.525 --> 45:51.962
is homie lost his shit back there.

45:52.997 --> 45:55.932
- It was just a show.
- For you, maybe.

45:57.168 --> 46:01.366
- Half those fuckers, they were ready to go.
- They weren't gonna do anything.

46:01.439 --> 46:03.066
How well do you know them?

46:03.340 --> 46:05.205
The assholes outnumber us, for one.

46:05.276 --> 46:07.335
If they wanted to take the advantage,
they could.

46:07.411 --> 46:10.175
Us out here in the middle
of fucking nowhere, we're on our own.

46:10.948 --> 46:12.711
The experimenters,
they wouldn't let anything happen.

46:12.783 --> 46:14.808
How well do you know them?

46:19.356 --> 46:22.723
Seventy-seven, he's the ringleader.

46:23.928 --> 46:28.797
Either way, if it keeps going like this,
someone's gonna throw down.

46:29.166 --> 46:33.159
Look, guys, guys.
If anyone gets hurt, this experiment is over.

46:33.237 --> 46:34.329
None of us will get paid.

46:34.405 --> 46:36.896
Well, we gotta put the clamps on this thing
once and for all then.

46:37.808 --> 46:39.400
What're you thinking?

46:42.046 --> 46:43.877
You wanna know how to reach these guys?

46:45.182 --> 46:46.171
How?

46:49.320 --> 46:50.844
You scare 'em.

47:34.665 --> 47:36.098
Comfortable?

47:42.973 --> 47:44.167
Helweg?

47:48.245 --> 47:49.473
Come on...

47:57.488 --> 48:01.219
The prisoners, they listen to you.

48:03.961 --> 48:07.920
For some reason they look to you
like you're the leader.

48:10.701 --> 48:12.430
I got news for you.

48:12.503 --> 48:14.130
In here,

48:14.205 --> 48:17.766
you're the leader of shit.

48:20.044 --> 48:22.911
This place, it belongs to us.

48:22.980 --> 48:25.005
It belongs to us.

48:27.418 --> 48:31.081
Hey, there are all kinds of things
that we could do to you

48:32.756 --> 48:36.487
to make you hip to that fact.

48:47.805 --> 48:53.766
So, do we have the proper respect

48:54.044 --> 48:55.807
for authority now?

48:57.681 --> 49:00.377
Fuck you, you sick fuck.

49:34.151 --> 49:36.745
This stuff is going right through me.

49:41.892 --> 49:43.951
- Saddle up, gentlemen!
- Fuck!

49:44.028 --> 49:45.893
You want to send a message?

49:45.963 --> 49:49.091
Then send a message. Saddle up.

49:51.802 --> 49:53.531
Saddle up!

49:57.341 --> 49:58.330
What the hell...

50:38.716 --> 50:39.978
You okay?

51:29.600 --> 51:33.434
That was colossally fucked up.

51:34.104 --> 51:36.368
I mean, you are shit-ass nuts,
you know that?

51:38.275 --> 51:40.641
And that's a good thing, Barris.

51:41.779 --> 51:47.911
The light, it didn't come on.
They saw it, and it's not coming on.

51:50.421 --> 51:55.723
We did what we did, we sent a message,
but it never leaves this place.

51:56.026 --> 51:57.516
I got something to say.

51:58.996 --> 52:03.330
If anything happens like that again,
anything at all,

52:05.569 --> 52:06.695
I'm out of here.

52:08.539 --> 52:11.872
You make a unilateral decision like that,

52:14.645 --> 52:17.944
it could cost the rest of us 100 grand.

52:21.452 --> 52:23.113
I don't care, sir.

52:40.537 --> 52:42.198
Let it go.

52:58.789 --> 52:59.813
Scenario.

52:59.890 --> 53:04.224
Someone harms someone you love.
Rapes them, kills them.

53:04.294 --> 53:05.625
The law fails to prosecute.

53:06.230 --> 53:10.326
This person is free.
There is absolutely nothing you can do.

53:10.634 --> 53:14.195
- Would you consider that justice?
- I don't think on those terms.

53:14.271 --> 53:18.605
Justice is what keeps us safe
as a society. Ordered.

53:18.675 --> 53:24.341
Well, justice is... Well, it starts wars.
An eye for an eye for an eye.

53:25.816 --> 53:29.650
It takes a turning of the cheek
for this species to evolve.

53:29.720 --> 53:32.484
So, you're the one who knows
what it's going to take

53:32.556 --> 53:34.490
for the human species to evolve.

53:34.658 --> 53:37.491
Just regurgitating what people
a lot smarter than me have been saying

53:37.561 --> 53:40.291
for a long, long time.

54:15.432 --> 54:16.490
Hey.

54:20.871 --> 54:24.967
Look what I found. Take it.
That ought to boost your blood sugar.

54:27.110 --> 54:28.099
No, it won't.

54:28.211 --> 54:30.270
Yeah, there's a lot of carbohydrates in there.

54:30.347 --> 54:35.341
It's like the world's cheapest bread.
It's going to turn to sugar. Trust me.

54:35.919 --> 54:38.080
Yeah, it won't turn to insulin, though.

54:40.424 --> 54:42.358
I thought you didn't need insulin.

54:42.859 --> 54:43.917
Fibbed.

54:46.263 --> 54:53.101
If they wouldn't let me bring it down here,
I figured I could tough it out.

54:53.904 --> 54:55.269
Jesus Christ.

54:57.274 --> 54:59.071
- Benjy...
- Fifty-one.

54:59.142 --> 55:02.634
Listen, you can't play around with this.
I got to let them know immediately.

55:02.713 --> 55:04.237
I mean, they need to know.
I got to get you out of here.

55:04.314 --> 55:05.303
No.

55:06.083 --> 55:08.074
You don't understand. You could die.

55:08.585 --> 55:11.748
Not if I get the insulin.

55:15.559 --> 55:17.322
Why are you doing this?

55:19.830 --> 55:25.268
Flying Man is a fraud.

55:26.903 --> 55:27.892
Don't say that.

55:27.971 --> 55:34.274
Yeah. It's stupid. It's a stupid, shitty, fat lie.
Just like me.

55:35.012 --> 55:36.604
He's just a man that flies.

55:42.653 --> 55:47.147
I need this. I need to stop being a fraud.

55:49.092 --> 55:53.051
I need for once to have something
to show for myself.

55:55.666 --> 56:00.433
Please, 77. Please.

56:37.240 --> 56:39.868
- What the fuck you doing?
- Jesus!

56:41.011 --> 56:42.000
Nothing.

56:42.179 --> 56:46.479
- Don't beat your shit off next to me.
- I'm not beating my shit. Fuck off.

57:24.154 --> 57:26.987
I'll give you a thousand of my own money.

57:28.925 --> 57:30.620
He should just go.

57:31.895 --> 57:37.299
Listen, man, there's insulin in his bag.
Can you get it?

57:41.772 --> 57:43.933
You know that's not allowed.

57:45.475 --> 57:47.875
I'll give you two. Two thousand.

57:53.617 --> 57:55.949
Two thousand, man. He needs it.

58:06.029 --> 58:07.929
I don't need the money.

58:40.163 --> 58:43.860
Twenty-two. Get up.

58:45.635 --> 58:47.330
Captain wants to see you.

59:12.329 --> 59:14.422
Lucky for us, there's no cameras in here.

59:16.733 --> 59:17.859
What?

59:17.934 --> 59:21.995
All right, so if we're going to do this,
you can't tell anybody.

59:23.907 --> 59:25.374
The fuck are you talking about?

59:27.277 --> 59:29.871
All I want is a blow job. That's it.

59:30.747 --> 59:32.271
No, no, no, no.

59:33.350 --> 59:36.285
Come on. Just get down on your knees.

59:36.353 --> 59:37.547
Yeah. I'm going to go back to my cell...

59:38.889 --> 59:41.255
First, you get down on your knees, all right?
All right?

59:41.324 --> 59:42.621
I want to go back to my cell.

59:42.692 --> 59:45.354
You will soon enough.
But first you're going to suck my dick.

59:45.762 --> 59:47.024
Suck it yourself.

59:47.097 --> 59:50.760
Get down on your knees.
Get down on your fucking knees.

59:54.271 --> 59:55.295
What's going on in here?

59:55.405 --> 59:56.429
Nothing.

59:56.706 --> 59:58.674
What is that prisoner doing out of his cell?

59:58.909 --> 01:00:02.606
He had something to tell me
about number 77.

01:00:03.113 --> 01:00:05.581
He didn't want to say it in front of the others.

01:00:05.649 --> 01:00:07.344
- Seventy-seven?
- Yeah.

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:09.282
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

01:00:09.486 --> 01:00:11.477
No, I'm asking him. Is that true?

01:00:11.655 --> 01:00:13.384
It's true. It's true.

01:00:13.456 --> 01:00:16.857
Barris. Thank God I found you.
You got to come quick.

01:00:25.835 --> 01:00:26.824
See?

01:00:33.476 --> 01:00:34.534
Why?

01:00:46.389 --> 01:00:47.686
What were you doing back there?

01:00:49.793 --> 01:00:50.782
Nothing.

01:00:51.828 --> 01:00:53.921
I need you to empty your pockets
for me then.

01:00:56.366 --> 01:01:00.234
Empty your pockets, Bosch.
Empty that pocket right there.

01:01:17.721 --> 01:01:23.489
You know that nothing from the outside
world enters into this cell block.

01:01:24.027 --> 01:01:26.359
- You know that, right?
- I mean, I was...

01:01:26.596 --> 01:01:28.587
Quiet. Shut up.

01:01:32.902 --> 01:01:36.065
They're trying to get you to undermine me.
I know you would never do that.

01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:39.971
Who asked you to do that?

01:01:41.111 --> 01:01:43.102
You tell me and all will be forgiven.

01:01:45.515 --> 01:01:46.982
Who told you?

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.285
We need to talk later about this.

01:02:30.126 --> 01:02:31.218
Later.

01:02:55.218 --> 01:02:56.776
As you can see,

01:02:59.055 --> 01:03:00.647
I'm a reasonable man.

01:03:01.257 --> 01:03:05.216
I'm not the monster that you
somehow conjured up in your head.

01:03:10.667 --> 01:03:12.828
I've been given a position,

01:03:14.537 --> 01:03:16.232
didn't ask for it.

01:03:18.575 --> 01:03:23.308
In some ways it would've been easier
if I was just a prisoner.

01:03:24.147 --> 01:03:27.116
- Like you.
- I doubt that very much.

01:03:27.584 --> 01:03:29.313
You broke the rules again, 77.

01:03:29.385 --> 01:03:31.012
The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin...

01:03:31.087 --> 01:03:32.554
"The guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin."

01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:33.987
"Guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin."

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:35.214
Did you hear that?

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:37.350
A guy could've died
if he didn't get his insulin!

01:03:38.995 --> 01:03:40.257
Really?

01:03:40.363 --> 01:03:43.264
When you speak, can you hear yourself?

01:03:48.404 --> 01:03:51.567
What do you think is on
the other side of those cameras?

01:03:54.277 --> 01:03:56.336
We are being watched

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.878
24 hours a day by people
who know what they are doing.

01:04:02.752 --> 01:04:07.621
Do you think that if there was even a chance,
just the littlest bit of a chance,

01:04:08.825 --> 01:04:11.123
that somebody'd die,
that they would let it happen?

01:04:12.262 --> 01:04:14.696
He's perfectly safe, your friend.

01:04:16.733 --> 01:04:21.568
They will keep him perfectly safe.

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.271
When this is over,
you know what you ought to do?

01:04:27.677 --> 01:04:28.769
No.

01:04:29.946 --> 01:04:32.176
You ought to take this money,

01:04:32.982 --> 01:04:36.474
take a little time off
from whatever it is that you do.

01:04:37.587 --> 01:04:41.421
Check into a nice, clean mental facility

01:04:41.824 --> 01:04:45.692
where experts can properly diagnose
what exactly is wrong with you.

01:04:46.196 --> 01:04:48.460
Maybe you could suggest to me
a mental facility,

01:04:48.531 --> 01:04:52.433
because obviously you're running around
in a mental facility inside of your head.

01:04:53.403 --> 01:04:54.597
You're letting this guy
fucking run the show?

01:04:54.671 --> 01:04:56.070
You're still not following the rules.

01:04:56.139 --> 01:04:57.800
- You need help.
- Still arguing about the rules.

01:04:58.775 --> 01:05:02.211
I'm not trying to instigate anything.
You need to get help, okay?

01:05:02.712 --> 01:05:05.044
You need some fucking help.

01:05:06.783 --> 01:05:08.614
You know what I need?

01:05:09.185 --> 01:05:13.781
I need you to clean that toilet.

01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:20.294
- That's what I need.
- Enough. Enough of this shit, man.

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:24.361
Toilet! It's not cleaning itself.

01:05:24.534 --> 01:05:27.560
Let's just stop this, all right, guys?
Let's stop.

01:05:27.637 --> 01:05:29.161
You're in charge.
Does that make you happy?

01:05:29.572 --> 01:05:34.009
Toilet! I need you to clean my toilet!

01:05:34.177 --> 01:05:36.668
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:39.512
Fuck. You.

01:05:40.049 --> 01:05:44.577
I don't normally like to use profanity,
but fuck you!

01:05:45.822 --> 01:05:46.811
Fuck...

01:05:56.866 --> 01:05:59.164
You are a prisoner, 77.

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:02.531
But your pride is getting in the way.

01:06:05.908 --> 01:06:10.743
I think I need you to say it for me.

01:06:11.247 --> 01:06:14.614
Say, "I am a prisoner."

01:06:15.285 --> 01:06:16.411
Fuck you.

01:06:23.393 --> 01:06:24.621
Say it.

01:06:25.795 --> 01:06:26.921
Fuck...

01:06:39.876 --> 01:06:40.865
Say it.

01:06:50.219 --> 01:06:51.311
Go to hell.

01:07:10.673 --> 01:07:12.300
Stop it, please.

01:07:15.144 --> 01:07:17.339
Then say it for me.

01:07:22.285 --> 01:07:23.274
I...

01:07:25.722 --> 01:07:27.849
I am...

01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:32.557
A prisoner. A prisoner.

01:07:32.995 --> 01:07:37.591
A prisoner. I am a prisoner.

01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:42.562
Yes. Yes. Yes, 77.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.301
That is exactly what you are.

01:09:34.817 --> 01:09:38.719
Hey. Talk to you for a minute?

01:09:46.395 --> 01:09:47.622
Come on.

01:09:55.938 --> 01:09:57.235
Let's go.

01:10:09.452 --> 01:10:14.253
- How come we can't talk back in the room?
- Some of the guys just wouldn't wait.

01:10:19.028 --> 01:10:22.589
Whatever you guys are going to do,
please don't do it.

01:10:53.095 --> 01:10:59.125
I think it's pretty clear by now there will be
a zero tolerance for breaking the rules.

01:11:08.311 --> 01:11:13.271
Bosch will be joining the prison population.

01:11:14.016 --> 01:11:18.112
He will be referred to now as Prisoner 76.

01:11:19.622 --> 01:11:23.114
Is there a problem with that, Prisoner 77?

01:11:26.495 --> 01:11:27.587
Good.

01:11:30.633 --> 01:11:35.798
I am an equitable man. Equitable. Equitable.

01:11:36.939 --> 01:11:43.037
<i>Not once, not once can you accuse me</i>

01:11:43.145 --> 01:11:44.510
<i>of breaking the rules.</i>

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.107
<i>The rules, they help us</i>
<i>because they guide us...</i>

01:11:52.555 --> 01:11:55.683
<i>So that we can exist. So that we can exist.</i>

01:11:56.425 --> 01:11:58.017
Exist in this world.

01:12:00.062 --> 01:12:03.088
Everybody's not happy with their lot in life.

01:12:04.033 --> 01:12:06.467
They have a position, he has a position,

01:12:06.736 --> 01:12:10.672
and all of you, all of you,
you have your positions.

01:12:11.641 --> 01:12:17.204
And I, I have a position.
Without the rules, there's chaos.

01:12:23.219 --> 01:12:24.584
Put that back on.

01:12:35.965 --> 01:12:38.957
I said, put that back on, 77.

01:12:45.408 --> 01:12:46.807
Did you hear me, 77?

01:12:50.012 --> 01:12:54.881
Put it back on! You put that back on.
You get back in the line.

01:12:55.384 --> 01:12:59.343
Don't take another step. What're you doing?
Just let him go by? Stop him!

01:13:00.456 --> 01:13:03.653
Open the gate. You in there.

01:13:03.726 --> 01:13:04.750
- We're done.
- Seventy-seven.

01:13:04.927 --> 01:13:06.918
You hear me? We're done.

01:13:07.496 --> 01:13:08.895
We're done.

01:13:13.402 --> 01:13:17.429
Nobody speaks to them, do you hear me?
Nobody.

01:13:17.773 --> 01:13:21.641
Nobody can speak to them.
You don't say one single word to them!

01:13:21.711 --> 01:13:25.977
That's rule number one now.
Nobody speaks to them!

01:13:26.048 --> 01:13:27.675
That's my friend!

01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:49.936
You fucking lowlife! You piece of shit!

01:13:50.005 --> 01:13:52.132
You couldn't just shut the fuck up,
could you?

01:13:52.208 --> 01:13:54.335
You brought this on your fucking self!

01:13:54.844 --> 01:13:56.209
Fuck you!

01:13:57.279 --> 01:14:00.908
Divide the prisoners up.
Isolate them so they can't communicate.

01:14:00.983 --> 01:14:04.475
The only strength in numbers
I want inside this place is ours.

01:14:56.739 --> 01:15:02.905
How the fuck can you listen to that shit?
I can't even fucking think.

01:15:03.179 --> 01:15:04.373
All I know is I'm out of here.

01:15:06.081 --> 01:15:08.879
You do know that any decisions we make,

01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:10.009
we make together?

01:15:10.085 --> 01:15:11.279
Well, this thing's over.

01:15:11.487 --> 01:15:12.977
We used violence
and the experiment's done.

01:15:13.055 --> 01:15:17.219
Is it? It's been a lot longer than half an hour
and red light hasn't come on yet.

01:15:17.293 --> 01:15:18.521
So fucking what?

01:15:18.594 --> 01:15:22.553
If you think about this rationally,
it was the prisoners who did the violence.

01:15:22.631 --> 01:15:24.724
We just responded commensurately.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.497
Fuck commensurately.
And fuck that fucking red light!

01:15:29.371 --> 01:15:31.202
How can you say that?

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.438
The red light,
that's the only thing that we have!

01:15:34.543 --> 01:15:35.532
Don't you realize that?

01:15:39.014 --> 01:15:42.142
It's the only way that we can know.

01:15:46.288 --> 01:15:47.312
Where's my music?

01:16:00.202 --> 01:16:02.568
You can feel what's happening, right?

01:16:03.572 --> 01:16:06.564
You're fucking crazy. You know that?

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:09.868
Can you feel it?

01:16:45.347 --> 01:16:51.343
What? Camera? Camera.

01:16:56.392 --> 01:16:59.589
Why? Why would you have...

01:16:59.662 --> 01:17:02.722
Why don't you stop this? Why?

01:17:28.157 --> 01:17:34.357
I'll fucking kill you. Kill. I'll fucking kill you.

01:17:55.818 --> 01:17:58.912
I'm going to take that tape off of you.

01:17:58.988 --> 01:18:01.980
And you're going to give me what I want.
Okay?

01:18:04.493 --> 01:18:05.517
Fuck you.

01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:11.622
You're a fucking faggot. You know that.

01:18:15.404 --> 01:18:20.842
Aren't you afraid? Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:22.478 --> 01:18:23.911
I know you.

01:18:40.596 --> 01:18:45.898
You didn't think I would see?
You didn't think I was smart enough?

01:18:52.775 --> 01:18:54.470
Please don't hit me again.

01:18:54.743 --> 01:18:56.506
Hey, I was going to try to be nice.

01:19:06.455 --> 01:19:08.389
Fucking kill you.

01:19:19.468 --> 01:19:20.662
Please.

01:19:24.039 --> 01:19:27.702
You know, if your mouth
doesn't want to play nice,

01:19:30.212 --> 01:19:32.840
we'll just have to use the other end.

01:19:45.928 --> 01:19:48.829
No. No, no, please. Wait, wait. Time out.

01:19:48.897 --> 01:19:52.162
- Shut up!
- Time out, time out.

01:20:22.164 --> 01:20:24.758
No. Please don't do this.

01:20:27.035 --> 01:20:28.024
Hi.

01:20:39.648 --> 01:20:41.445
Go to sleep, motherfucker, go to sleep.

01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:44.541
You think fags are funny?
Who's funny now?

01:20:54.496 --> 01:21:00.298
- Hey, kid. You all right?
- No. Thank you. Thank you.

01:21:13.115 --> 01:21:14.707
You still want to go along and get along?

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.410
Fuck no.

01:21:22.724 --> 01:21:25.488
These boys must think I'm somebody else.

01:21:38.473 --> 01:21:39.963
Everybody's out, man.

01:21:43.412 --> 01:21:45.346
Hey, buddy. Hey, man.

01:22:06.868 --> 01:22:09.063
No, no, no. Come on.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.681
Barris, we got trouble.

01:22:33.028 --> 01:22:34.052
Coming for you!

01:22:34.563 --> 01:22:35.552
Jesus.

01:23:02.291 --> 01:23:04.384
Jesus. What'll we do?

01:23:05.761 --> 01:23:06.921
We get ready.

01:23:09.598 --> 01:23:13.796
You're fucking losing it, man.
They outnumber us two to one.

01:23:21.276 --> 01:23:26.043
Maybe, but they're still prisoners.
And they're still scared of us.

01:23:28.684 --> 01:23:30.675
We're the authority here.

01:23:33.555 --> 01:23:36.217
Does that look like they give a fuck?

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.858
Fuck your authority.

01:23:42.698 --> 01:23:44.666
About fucking time.

01:24:29.411 --> 01:24:33.074
What're you doing? What are you doing?
We got to stand and fight!

01:24:33.181 --> 01:24:36.912
This is our world!
You cannot take it from us! No!

01:24:37.252 --> 01:24:38.378
Why are you doing this?

01:24:38.587 --> 01:24:40.817
We're still guards! Guards!

01:25:00.409 --> 01:25:02.309
This is your fault!

01:29:42.424 --> 01:29:46.656
You still think we're higher
on the evolutionary chain than monkeys?

01:29:55.103 --> 01:29:56.297
Yeah.

01:29:58.973 --> 01:30:01.874
'Cause we can still do something about it.

01:30:06.281 --> 01:30:07.339
<i>The facility is actively leased</i>

01:30:07.415 --> 01:30:11.146
<i>by a corporate think-tank</i>
<i>reported to have ties to the government.</i>

01:30:11.219 --> 01:30:13.380
A spokesperson with the Monad Corporation

01:30:13.455 --> 01:30:16.424
tells us the facility has been used
for psychological testing.

01:30:16.491 --> 01:30:19.392
Yes, we'll testify. Whatever it takes.

01:30:19.461 --> 01:30:22.453
A guy died in there.
A guy named Benjy Putterman.

01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:25.226
<i>... arrested the lead researcher,</i>
<i>a Dr. John Archalata,</i>

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.495
<i>and charged him with manslaughter.</i>

01:30:27.569 --> 01:30:29.696
<i>We'll bring you more</i>
