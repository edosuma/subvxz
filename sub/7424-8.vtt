00:16.836 --> 00:18.719
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

00:18.721 --> 00:20.004
You're him.

00:20.006 --> 00:23.707
She makes me feel like
I have a life again.

00:23.709 --> 00:26.377
Vincent, I need you.
Someone took Evan.

00:31.818 --> 00:33.718
I don't know how
we cover this one up.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.902
Evan heard the whole attack.

00:34.904 --> 00:37.121
Be as normal as you
can possibly be.

00:37.123 --> 00:39.507
<i>No one needs to know you have</i>
<i>anything to do with us.</i>

00:39.509 --> 00:41.926
Whatever killed Peter,

00:41.928 --> 00:43.661
it wasn't entirely human.

00:43.663 --> 00:44.829
Vincent, you all right?

00:46.498 --> 00:49.033
<i>He's dangerous, and if he's not</i>
<i>in control of himself,</i>

00:49.035 --> 00:51.085
<i>somebody needs to be.</i>

00:51.087 --> 00:52.303
No, you can't keep him in that.

00:52.305 --> 00:55.456
We are going to figure out
a way to fix this.

03:06.139 --> 03:07.471

03:21.387 --> 03:23.387

03:23.389 --> 03:24.605

03:26.192 --> 03:30.361
Well, I didn't want

03:31.781 --> 03:33.897
Yeah.

Chief ordered

04:02.928 --> 04:05.062
a protection detail on him

04:05.064 --> 04:07.114
Protocol has one of us

See?

04:13.573 --> 04:18.608
A'ight. Only if
I get her, though.

04:18.611 --> 04:20.494
Yeah.

04:21.963 --> 04:25.049

04:25.051 --> 04:26.684
it was Mud-bogging Day.

04:26.686 --> 04:28.452

04:28.454 --> 04:30.120
stomping before
you sneak up on someone?

04:30.122 --> 04:31.755

What were you doing?

04:31.757 --> 04:34.725
I can't get what happened
out of my head.

04:34.727 --> 04:36.343
I went back.

04:36.345 --> 04:38.312
To the subway tunnels?

04:38.314 --> 04:41.565
Evan, you were kidnapped

04:41.567 --> 04:44.968
and almost killed
by a psycho frat boy.

04:44.970 --> 04:48.405
Yeah, and then saved
by some mysterious vigilante.

04:48.407 --> 04:49.640
It's understandable
that you're traumatized;

04:49.642 --> 04:51.158
what you went through
was brutal.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.359
It was.

04:52.361 --> 04:55.029
But it's more
than that, you know?

04:55.031 --> 04:56.780
It happened so fast.

04:56.782 --> 04:59.750
I heard a psycho getting
ripped apart by some thing,

04:59.752 --> 05:01.452
and then you saved me,

05:01.454 --> 05:03.420
bullets flying...

05:03.422 --> 05:09.760
Evan, whoever this vigilante is,
it is not a "some thing."

05:09.762 --> 05:11.679
Cat, it's just,
you were right there,

05:11.681 --> 05:13.330
and he was right there.

05:13.332 --> 05:15.766
I was too busy
trying to save your ass.

05:15.768 --> 05:17.852
Well, you were the only one
in a position to see him,

05:17.854 --> 05:19.520
and you say that
you didn't, though.

05:19.522 --> 05:20.938
What does that give us?

05:20.940 --> 05:22.857
What's less than nothing?

05:22.859 --> 05:26.443
Can't you just let it go?

05:28.613 --> 05:30.731
I never did thank you.

05:30.733 --> 05:35.703
Well, I will exchange
your gratitude for a favor.

05:41.993 --> 05:44.361
Okay.

05:44.363 --> 05:47.414

the DNA from these letters

05:47.416 --> 05:48.966

and the juvie system.

05:48.968 --> 05:51.201

that your shooter is

some mall-dwelling teen?

05:52.588 --> 05:54.204
It's too early
to rule anything out.

05:54.206 --> 05:56.340
Could you put it to the top
of your list?

05:56.342 --> 05:58.008
For the woman that saved me

05:58.010 --> 06:02.012
from an extremely traumatizing
near-death experience...

06:02.014 --> 06:03.264
all right.

06:03.266 --> 06:05.449
Thank you.

06:11.156 --> 06:14.775

while I study you.

06:15.577 --> 06:16.560

okay, dude.

06:31.928 --> 06:34.428
It's gonna be okay.

06:35.797 --> 06:37.715

boosts and we'll be unstoppable.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.494
Oh, yeah.

07:07.496 --> 07:09.380

07:09.382 --> 07:11.465
but the progress
we're seeing

07:11.467 --> 07:13.801
is better than any outcome
we could have projected.

07:18.624 --> 07:22.059

07:22.061 --> 07:23.794

10:55.250 --> 10:58.168
And you never told us?
JT...

10:58.170 --> 10:59.485
I didn't believe him.

10:59.487 --> 11:01.037
He was using whatever he could

11:01.039 --> 11:02.589
to turn me against you.

11:04.158 --> 11:05.992
It couldn't be real.

11:05.994 --> 11:08.011
Well, it is.

11:08.013 --> 11:09.629
You never

11:09.631 --> 11:11.815
thought to tell us about this?

11:11.817 --> 11:13.900
Vincent, I'm sorry.

11:14.769 --> 11:17.470
I just...

11:17.472 --> 11:20.557
I thought we were done with
all these secrets, you know?

11:20.559 --> 11:22.559
That's why we called you
over here.

11:22.561 --> 11:24.444
Look, it's okay.
We don't actually

11:24.446 --> 11:27.346
know how involved
your mom was.

11:27.348 --> 11:28.948
But we know
she wasn't innocent,

11:28.950 --> 11:31.367
since it was enough
to get her killed.

11:34.038 --> 11:35.521
Wait.

11:35.523 --> 11:37.574
Wait. You're inducing
another blackout?

11:38.659 --> 11:40.827
If it has the same effect
as last time,

11:40.829 --> 11:43.413
it may be the only way we get
to know more about your mom.

11:44.331 --> 11:45.532
Don't you want to know?

11:45.534 --> 11:47.417
Okay, JT,

11:47.419 --> 11:49.368
I need to be under longer
this time.

11:50.472 --> 11:52.038
I need the answers

11:52.040 --> 11:54.307
to get out of this cage.
Come on.

12:11.909 --> 12:13.576
It's amazing. Like...

12:13.578 --> 12:16.779
there's all this new energy
just bursting out of me.

12:16.781 --> 12:18.064
You're not the only one.

12:18.066 --> 12:19.949
Did you see Thrace
bodyslam Harris?

12:19.951 --> 12:23.903
I mean, it was like the WWE
comes to the desert.

12:23.905 --> 12:26.673
You weren't too bad
out there yourself.

12:32.413 --> 12:34.747
Okay. I know

12:34.749 --> 12:36.132
they're giving us vitamins,

12:36.134 --> 12:38.685
but what kind of supplements
they hiding in there?

12:38.687 --> 12:41.254
I don't know, but I like it.

12:45.259 --> 12:47.026
Lafferty?

12:49.063 --> 12:50.697
Lafferty?

12:59.874 --> 13:02.575
Dr. C, she just
completely zoned out.

13:10.134 --> 13:14.554
He's having a hard time
coming out of it.

13:16.056 --> 13:19.759
Come on, guys, push yourselves.
Push yourselves.

13:19.761 --> 13:22.461
Come on.
Keep going. Keep going.

13:27.985 --> 13:30.186
Keller, is it?

13:30.188 --> 13:31.137
Yes, ma'am.

13:31.139 --> 13:32.655
How are you feeling?

13:32.657 --> 13:35.474
Uh, incredible.

13:35.476 --> 13:38.278
Never felt better--
ready to get out there.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.981
After that last session,
you don't feel any fatigue?

13:41.983 --> 13:44.817
Impaired sensory awareness?
Memory loss?

13:44.819 --> 13:46.586
Uh, no.

13:46.588 --> 13:49.122
Uh, my hearing's
getting better though.

13:49.124 --> 13:51.674
I feel like I can hear
a conversation

13:51.676 --> 13:54.493
from, like, a mile away.

13:54.495 --> 13:55.712
Is that normal?

13:55.714 --> 13:56.679
Nothing's normal

13:56.681 --> 13:58.181
about you anymore, Vincent.

13:58.183 --> 14:00.016
But we couldn't continue
this war without you.

14:00.018 --> 14:01.500
You mean without

14:01.502 --> 14:04.470
soldiers who can put
their fists through a table.

14:04.472 --> 14:09.342
What matters is that
after we win this war,

14:09.344 --> 14:12.678
we're all going home
to lead healthy, long lives.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.864
To our families.

14:17.534 --> 14:21.237
That's why I joined this project
in the first place.

14:21.239 --> 14:24.190
To protect my daughters.

14:24.192 --> 14:25.241
Our country.

14:25.243 --> 14:26.859
Dr. Chandler?

14:28.295 --> 14:30.496
Is everything okay
with Lafferty?

14:30.498 --> 14:32.749
You know, we haven't seen
her since she went down

14:32.751 --> 14:34.917
I mean, what happened?

14:34.919 --> 14:38.304
You created us and you never
mentioned these side effects.

14:38.306 --> 14:40.039
We didn't expect them.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.475
She lapsed into a fugue state.

14:42.477 --> 14:45.061
She temporarily lost cognizance.

14:45.063 --> 14:46.262
And the serum you gave her?

14:46.264 --> 14:47.713
To treat the blackouts.

14:47.715 --> 14:50.266
Hopefully alleviates
them altogether.

14:50.268 --> 14:53.936
Wait. Is it gonna happen
to all of us, or...?

14:53.938 --> 14:56.055
I don't know.

14:56.057 --> 14:57.857
At some point it's likely.

14:57.859 --> 15:02.412
But everyone's DNA is responding
differently to this project.

15:02.414 --> 15:06.916
We don't know when or why these
side effects are showing up.

15:06.918 --> 15:08.901
Well, you must have some idea.

15:08.903 --> 15:11.170
You don't have any
causative evidence?

15:14.541 --> 15:16.909
If you'll excuse me.

15:16.911 --> 15:18.577
Fall in!

15:21.882 --> 15:23.433
Do you want
to lose your arm?

15:23.435 --> 15:25.635
JT, move.

15:31.776 --> 15:33.092
Vincent, you're back.

15:33.094 --> 15:35.144
It's okay.

15:35.146 --> 15:37.196
Okay, come on.

15:41.435 --> 15:44.537
I need some water.

15:48.792 --> 15:50.626
You're not the reason
for the blackouts.

15:50.628 --> 15:52.445
Say what, now?

15:52.447 --> 15:54.881
What do you mean?

15:54.883 --> 15:56.249
It's not you.

15:56.251 --> 15:58.451
The blackouts are
a random side effect

15:58.453 --> 16:00.053
of the experiments.

16:00.055 --> 16:00.970
How do you know?

16:00.972 --> 16:02.805
Because your mom told me.

16:03.841 --> 16:05.141
Okay, your mom

16:05.143 --> 16:06.676
may have created us,

16:06.678 --> 16:09.746
but she was trying
to stop these side effects.

16:09.748 --> 16:11.898
I thought she was this doctor

16:11.900 --> 16:15.485
who helped people,
but she did this to you.

16:15.487 --> 16:18.137
You didn't, okay?
You're not the cause of this.

16:18.139 --> 16:19.989
Vincent, I am
so sorry.

16:19.991 --> 16:21.791
Don't be sorry.

16:21.793 --> 16:24.410
We don't have to stay away
from each other anymore.

16:28.148 --> 16:31.334
All this time I idolized her

16:31.336 --> 16:33.669
and I didn't even
know who she was.

16:35.655 --> 16:37.523
I have to make this right.

16:37.525 --> 16:39.375
You said she was working
on fixing it.

16:39.377 --> 16:42.211
She wouldn't have just
let her work disappear.

16:42.213 --> 16:43.830
I have to find it.

16:46.512 --> 16:48.313
<i>Well, this is unexpected.</i>

16:48.315 --> 16:50.732
Well, it is a week until
you're getting married.

16:50.734 --> 16:53.018
I thought that in the spirit
of moving forward,

16:53.020 --> 16:55.570
I'd clean out some
of Mom's things.

16:58.441 --> 17:01.276
Uh, no, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

17:01.278 --> 17:03.061
There's a reason they're
packed and stored away.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.230
Okay.

17:05.232 --> 17:09.367
This is sounding
kind of ominous.

17:09.368 --> 17:12.069
Your mother kept
a lot of secrets.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.723
Your mother did

17:14.724 --> 17:17.291
a lot of research, a lot
of lab work for the government.

17:17.294 --> 17:18.960
It was highly classified.

17:18.962 --> 17:22.631
Dad, why...

17:22.633 --> 17:24.766
Why didn't you tell me?

17:24.768 --> 17:26.734
After all this time?

17:26.737 --> 17:28.753
I was scared, Cat.

17:28.755 --> 17:30.972
I was scared
that the mother you loved

17:30.974 --> 17:33.024
wouldn't be the woman
I found in those boxes.

17:34.110 --> 17:36.528
What boxes, Dad?

17:36.530 --> 17:38.613
I locked her stuff away.
I thought it was best.

17:38.615 --> 17:39.781
Best for who?

17:39.783 --> 17:41.149
I wanted to protect you.

17:41.151 --> 17:42.150
But you didn't even know

17:42.152 --> 17:43.768
what you were protecting
me from.

17:43.770 --> 17:45.770
Catherine, listen to me:

17:45.772 --> 17:49.741
We are nothing more
than our memories,

17:49.743 --> 17:52.294
our stories,
the people we love.

17:52.296 --> 17:55.413
How other people
remember us.

17:55.415 --> 17:59.084
Daddy, you didn't
give me a choice.

17:59.086 --> 18:02.620
All these years I blamed myself
for what happened to her,

18:02.622 --> 18:03.788
and you have

18:03.790 --> 18:05.590
things...

18:05.592 --> 18:08.727
actual things that
could have given me answers.

18:19.272 --> 18:22.357
The storage room
behind the wine rack.

18:22.359 --> 18:25.643
It's your choice.

19:06.185 --> 19:08.954
All right, look,
I don't got time to burn.

19:08.956 --> 19:10.855
Of course, I got
other things to burn.

19:10.857 --> 19:12.791
That's cute, really.

19:12.793 --> 19:15.994
Mr. Little... That.
It's "Lil Tap That."

19:15.996 --> 19:18.863
Or just "Tap That"
to you, sweet thing.

19:18.865 --> 19:20.048
Not you, too.

19:20.050 --> 19:21.349
Where were you last night?

19:21.351 --> 19:23.468
The Clock Strikes.

19:23.470 --> 19:24.535
The club?

19:24.537 --> 19:26.171
Launched my new hat collection.

19:26.173 --> 19:27.672
All night?
Well, nah,

19:27.674 --> 19:29.207
there was this one honey,
and she...

19:29.209 --> 19:30.392
Don't care.
Don't want to know.

19:30.394 --> 19:32.260
What I do want
to know is what's up

19:32.262 --> 19:33.428
with you and Jake Riley?

19:33.430 --> 19:35.563
I hear you're in some
kind of Twitter war.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.715
Damn, girl, ain't
you ever heard of spin?

19:37.717 --> 19:39.351
Our managers
baked it all.

19:39.353 --> 19:41.403
You really think that stunt
with Riley was legit?

19:41.405 --> 19:43.989
They're just trying to bump me
off the cover of <i>Tiger Beat.</i>

19:43.991 --> 19:45.723
Managers are really
that tabloid-hungry?

19:45.725 --> 19:47.108
Drama sells.

19:47.110 --> 19:48.827
Lady, you see this scar?

19:48.829 --> 19:51.079
I had to throw down
in a bar 'cause my single

19:51.081 --> 19:52.330
was dropping the next day.

19:52.332 --> 19:54.065
A year ago,
Miller sent JR to rehab

19:54.067 --> 19:56.334
and the kid's as clean
as my grandma.

19:56.336 --> 19:58.219
They'd sell our souls.

19:58.221 --> 20:00.712
So, you and Jake Riley
don't hate each other?

20:00.737 --> 20:01.090
Nah.

20:01.091 --> 20:03.758
He's leagues below me, yo.
He's got the girls.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.593
I got the women.
Okay.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.762
All right, enough--
we're done here.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.018
Sorry about
that, man.

20:13.020 --> 20:16.104
Yo, these people
taking forever...

20:16.106 --> 20:17.722
Ooh.

20:17.724 --> 20:19.140
Get out of my chair.

20:29.151 --> 20:30.819
Ooh, Mommy Chandler
was a looker.

20:30.821 --> 20:33.288
Not helping, JT.

20:33.290 --> 20:35.156
So, Vincent saw
your mom taking notes

20:35.158 --> 20:37.125
in an olive notebook both times.

20:37.127 --> 20:39.627
It had to be where she kept her
observation and research notes.

20:39.629 --> 20:42.480
Okay, hold on.

20:42.482 --> 20:43.648
Check the big box.

20:43.650 --> 20:45.383
You know, I really

20:45.385 --> 20:47.285
don't need backseat detectiving.
Just trying to help.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.505
It's not like it's gonna be
labeled "Cure for Vincent."

20:52.808 --> 20:53.808
Got it.

20:53.810 --> 20:55.009
Look for something that

20:55.011 --> 20:58.430
could be a formula,
equations.

20:58.432 --> 21:01.483
Okay, I have no idea
what I'm looking at here.

21:01.485 --> 21:03.518
Wait, uh, turn the page back.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.236
- Did you see something?
- To see something

21:05.238 --> 21:07.272
you'll have to turn
the page back so I can know

21:07.274 --> 21:08.990
if I see something.

21:08.992 --> 21:12.043
It's a miracle that you have
so many friends.

21:12.045 --> 21:13.478
Hilarious. Keep turning.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.314
Keep going.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.499
Stop, uh, uh, go back.

21:17.501 --> 21:19.617
Uh, show me that last page.

21:19.619 --> 21:21.652
What's the notation say
at the bottom of the page?

21:21.654 --> 21:23.371
Psychogenic fugue.

21:23.373 --> 21:26.007
Your mom's notes
about Vincent's genetic makeup

21:26.009 --> 21:27.759
are crazy thorough.

21:27.761 --> 21:29.377
She mentions side effects
including memory loss

21:29.379 --> 21:32.680
and it looks like
she was working on formulas

21:32.682 --> 21:34.432
to counteract them.

21:34.434 --> 21:36.885
Only problem is
to replicate these,

21:36.887 --> 21:40.722
I need better equipment
and Vincent's blood.

21:40.724 --> 21:42.006
Better equipment like?

21:42.008 --> 21:44.626
A Spartan RX real-time
DNA analyzer.

21:44.628 --> 21:47.395
Okay, and where are we gonna
find one of those?

21:47.397 --> 21:49.180
A police forensics lab.

22:03.362 --> 22:04.796
That is a lot of cops.

22:04.798 --> 22:06.214
Okay, you ready?
How'd you get "you ready"

22:06.216 --> 22:08.750
off "That is a lot of cops"?
I'm trying to move things along.

22:08.752 --> 22:10.585
I know you're Sarah Connor
with a kung fu grip

22:10.587 --> 22:13.538
and all, but I'm
pee-in-your-pants terrified.

22:15.374 --> 22:16.925
Okay, I'm gonna text you
when we're leaving.

22:16.927 --> 22:18.543
The outer door to the morgue--
it'll be open,

22:18.545 --> 22:19.877
so you don't need
a security card.

22:19.879 --> 22:21.062
Two lefts, then a right.

22:21.064 --> 22:22.597
And you're right there.

22:22.599 --> 22:24.882
But I can only buy you
a couple hours at the most,

22:24.884 --> 22:26.601
so you need to make
that serum fast.

22:26.603 --> 22:28.436
Okay.

22:28.438 --> 22:31.055
Good luck.

22:36.618 --> 22:38.769
I'm so calling you
Cat in the Hat until you're 40.

22:38.771 --> 22:40.405
How could you leave me alone
with him

22:40.407 --> 22:43.074
the whole day?
Dad, Brooke, wedding nightmare.

22:43.076 --> 22:45.209
By the way, it turns out
that Jake's manager, Miller--

22:45.211 --> 22:46.711
he had a publicity deal
with Lil Tap That's manager.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.913
That whole Twitter feud
was staged.

22:48.915 --> 22:50.948
You think Miller staged
that shooting

22:50.950 --> 22:52.550
as a publicity stunt?

22:52.552 --> 22:54.135
I don't know, but I looked
into his financials.

22:54.137 --> 22:55.786
He withdrew large amounts
out of his work account.

22:55.788 --> 22:57.088
I think we got enough
for a warrant.

22:57.090 --> 22:58.389
I'm on it.
Uh, no.

22:58.391 --> 23:00.925
No, you are not
leaving me alone again

23:00.927 --> 23:02.293
to go gallivanting off.

23:02.295 --> 23:03.428
Tess, I owe you big.

23:03.430 --> 23:04.479
What else is new?

23:05.682 --> 23:06.630
How the hell
you work this thing?

23:10.319 --> 23:12.803
Just think of him
like he's Pinocchio.

23:12.805 --> 23:14.472
You know,

23:14.474 --> 23:16.324
he just wants
to be a real boy.

23:18.026 --> 23:20.495
Good luck.

23:20.497 --> 23:22.497
Victory is mine.

23:22.499 --> 23:24.665
For you, Manslayer,

23:24.667 --> 23:27.368
an offering.

23:27.370 --> 23:29.203
Thank you.

23:29.205 --> 23:30.688
Yeah.

23:39.047 --> 23:41.432
Still waiting on
those DNA swabs.

23:41.434 --> 23:44.018
Actually, I am heading
over to the manager's office.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.037
I was hoping
you'd come with me.

23:46.039 --> 23:47.205
Where's Tess?

23:47.207 --> 23:48.856
She's playing nanny.

23:48.858 --> 23:50.525
So, what do you say?

23:50.527 --> 23:52.693
Go out amongst the living?
It's not really my job.

23:52.695 --> 23:53.945
Come on,
I'm partnerless,

23:53.947 --> 23:55.613
and you could use
some field hours.

23:55.615 --> 23:57.732
Besides, do you really want
to sit around

23:57.734 --> 24:00.151
waiting for analysis
on envelope spit?

24:00.153 --> 24:01.402
Point taken.

24:01.404 --> 24:03.404
But you owe me one,

24:03.406 --> 24:05.123
and I plan on collecting.

24:17.002 --> 24:19.637
♪

24:54.122 --> 24:57.508
♪

25:07.302 --> 25:09.437
<i>What makes you so sure</i>

25:09.439 --> 25:10.888
that Riley's manager
staged the shooting?

25:10.890 --> 25:12.590
Seems like a bit of a stretch.

25:12.592 --> 25:14.942
After all the stunts he's
had Jake pull in the past,

25:14.944 --> 25:18.946
not really, also unprecedented
sizable bank withdrawal.

25:18.948 --> 25:20.264
He withdrew 30 grand.

25:20.266 --> 25:21.949
For what?
Not a yacht.

25:21.951 --> 25:24.535
If that's not a flag-raiser,
I don't know what is.

25:24.537 --> 25:26.571
Money probably went
to the shooter.

25:26.573 --> 25:28.439
What kind of person
hires a gunman

25:28.441 --> 25:30.124
as a publicity stunt?

25:30.126 --> 25:32.293
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say a crazy person.

25:32.295 --> 25:33.444
The shooter did miss,

25:33.446 --> 25:35.046
and Miller had
this handy bag

25:35.048 --> 25:37.281
of possible suspects
just waiting for us.

25:51.647 --> 25:54.632
I have to admit,
this is kind of fun.

25:54.634 --> 25:56.967
It is only fun if you, uh...

25:56.969 --> 25:59.136
find something.

26:08.146 --> 26:10.248
"My Unexpected Rise

26:10.250 --> 26:12.199
and Fall in the
Music Industry."

26:12.201 --> 26:15.036
Sounds like a bestseller.

26:17.706 --> 26:20.775
The last chapter isn't written
yet, but there is a title.

26:20.777 --> 26:22.793
"Tragedy:

26:22.795 --> 26:24.795
the Death of Jake Riley."

26:24.797 --> 26:26.163
Please?
No.

26:26.165 --> 26:27.831
Come on, you know
you want to show me.

26:27.833 --> 26:30.851
I really don't.
I'll sing you a ballad again.

26:30.853 --> 26:32.470
If you do, I'll arrest you.
That's it.

26:32.472 --> 26:33.938
If you don't show me
right now...

26:33.940 --> 26:35.306
♪ I'm gonna sing you a ballad. ♪
Fine.

26:35.308 --> 26:36.974
Boom, weakness exploited.

26:36.976 --> 26:38.776
Well, once you see it,

26:38.778 --> 26:40.678
there's no un-seeing it.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.014
Oh, my God.

27:01.866 --> 27:03.417
Yo, can I get some of these?

27:03.419 --> 27:04.885
No.
Oh.

27:04.887 --> 27:07.054
You hit like a girl.

27:16.381 --> 27:18.882
Yeah, it's me.

27:28.059 --> 27:30.745
Come on. Let's
see it already.

27:38.069 --> 27:40.171
Oh, my God, that's so wrong.

27:41.406 --> 27:43.591
Told you.

27:43.593 --> 27:44.959
Vincent!

27:44.961 --> 27:46.594
I broke into the morgue,

27:46.596 --> 27:49.096
made the serum,

27:49.098 --> 27:50.848
snagged Stallone from the U.

27:50.850 --> 27:55.052
Time to pump this guy full
of untested fugue deliciousness.

27:55.054 --> 27:58.105
No offense, buddy.

28:05.263 --> 28:06.563
No offense, buddy.

28:16.973 --> 28:19.140
Who's there?

28:29.768 --> 28:31.736
Oh, this is bad.

28:31.738 --> 28:35.874
This is really, really bad.

28:40.496 --> 28:42.396
Yo, this is bull.
It's not.

28:42.397 --> 28:44.797
Jake, I know this is hard to believe.
Yeah, 'cause it's not true.

28:44.799 --> 28:46.349
Miller betrayed you.

28:46.351 --> 28:48.384
He played on
your trust of him.

28:48.386 --> 28:50.252
Okay, we don't have
enough to book him,

28:50.254 --> 28:52.488
but we do have this.

28:52.490 --> 28:54.190
We found it in his office.

28:54.192 --> 28:56.943
Check out the title
of the last chapter.

28:56.945 --> 29:00.062
It's called "Tragedy."

29:00.064 --> 29:03.699
He expected you to die
in that shooting

29:03.701 --> 29:05.618
or at least, it seems that way,

29:05.620 --> 29:09.405
which means that he arranged it.

29:09.407 --> 29:11.240
I'm guessing "Tragedy"
isn't a chapter

29:11.242 --> 29:12.708
he's gonna want to change,

29:12.710 --> 29:13.960
and you're about
to do a live radio show,

29:13.962 --> 29:15.461
a very public event.

29:15.463 --> 29:16.779
Seems like a good twist

29:16.781 --> 29:18.080
in the story to me.

29:18.082 --> 29:21.083
"Just when I thought
J.R. was safe."

29:21.085 --> 29:22.668
Jake, a hit man that didn't
finish his job

29:22.670 --> 29:23.903
isn't gonna back off.

29:23.905 --> 29:26.139
He is going to finish
what he started.

29:26.141 --> 29:29.959
How sure are you you're right?

29:33.747 --> 29:35.798
<i>Vincent!</i>

29:49.196 --> 29:52.331
Dr. C.!

30:03.159 --> 30:04.844
Colonel, slow down.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.629
Just tell me what happened.

30:06.631 --> 30:08.181
The soldiers you created
are out there,

30:08.183 --> 30:09.549
tearing apart this
entire compound.

30:09.551 --> 30:11.267
That's why I wanted
time to test it.

30:11.269 --> 30:13.719
Time's up. Either you
fix the side effects,

30:13.721 --> 30:16.138
or the project's aborted.
Aborted? What?

30:16.140 --> 30:17.974
Terminated.
You can't kill your own men.

30:17.976 --> 30:19.892
Those aren't men.
They're animals.

30:19.894 --> 30:21.611
You communicate with an animal.

30:21.613 --> 30:22.845
They're not animals.

30:22.847 --> 30:24.230
I might not be able to reverse

30:24.232 --> 30:25.698
the full transformation yet,

30:25.700 --> 30:27.533
but the side effects,
the lost time, the aggression,

30:27.535 --> 30:29.952
if you just contain them instead of...
Do you want them

30:29.954 --> 30:32.622
to keep moving through the
country? To keep killing?

30:34.041 --> 30:35.691
Aren't you going with them?

30:35.693 --> 30:38.744
You're leaving the dirty work
to someone else.

30:38.746 --> 30:40.195
You can't leave this

30:40.197 --> 30:42.031
locked down forever.

30:42.033 --> 30:43.666
The world will find out
about them.

30:43.668 --> 30:45.134
Is that a threat, Doctor?

30:45.136 --> 30:46.552
You don't know

30:46.554 --> 30:48.137
when to stop talking.

30:48.139 --> 30:50.089
And that's a problem.

31:26.076 --> 31:27.960
Vincent.

31:27.962 --> 31:30.179
You're here with me.

31:31.683 --> 31:32.965
Please.

31:32.967 --> 31:34.967
Please, I need you.

31:34.969 --> 31:36.919
I can't do this without you
after everything

31:36.921 --> 31:39.105
I learned today about my mom.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.359
Please.

31:43.361 --> 31:45.945
You're here.

31:45.947 --> 31:49.932
Just... be here with me.

32:01.962 --> 32:04.446
Okay.

32:04.448 --> 32:07.833
You're okay.

32:07.835 --> 32:09.135
He's okay?

32:10.620 --> 32:12.888
Dude, dude.

32:12.890 --> 32:15.124
Did I hurt you?

32:15.126 --> 32:16.809
Oh.

32:16.811 --> 32:19.845
Nothing a Care Bears Band-Aid
can't fix.

32:19.847 --> 32:21.964
Vincent, dude,

32:21.966 --> 32:23.649
it's okay.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.351
We've got a plan.

32:25.353 --> 32:27.186
We'll test Vanessa's serum
on Stallone and...

32:27.188 --> 32:29.772
It's just a matter of time
before we test it on you.

32:29.774 --> 32:31.240
No.

32:31.242 --> 32:32.575
Uh, come again?

32:34.277 --> 32:37.813
I am not gonna spend my life
in and out of a cage,

32:37.815 --> 32:38.981
waiting for the lab rat

32:38.983 --> 32:40.649
to tell me to get out.

32:40.651 --> 32:41.867
Stop!

32:41.869 --> 32:42.835
Vincent, don't...

32:42.837 --> 32:44.120
What are you doing?

32:44.122 --> 32:45.671
We don't know
what this does.

32:45.673 --> 32:47.322
What if it makes you worse?

32:47.324 --> 32:48.758
Or kills you?

32:48.760 --> 32:50.793
You think living in a cage
isn't doing that?

32:50.795 --> 32:52.327
Well, it turns out

32:52.329 --> 32:55.047
I'm monstrous enough
to get out of it anyway.

32:57.333 --> 32:58.684
So what now?

32:58.686 --> 33:01.103
Now, we wait.

33:10.212 --> 33:11.580
All right. Let's go.
Thanks, see you.

33:11.582 --> 33:13.131
Hearing there's
a crowd out front.

33:13.133 --> 33:14.966
There isn't out back.
Let's stick to the plan.

33:47.316 --> 33:48.750
NYPD! Stay down!

33:50.152 --> 33:51.920
And that's how it's done.

33:54.373 --> 33:56.041
Mr. Miller, step out.

33:56.043 --> 33:57.292
What's going on?

33:57.294 --> 33:59.544
You saw that shooter
before anyone else.

33:59.546 --> 34:00.712
That's ridiculous.

34:00.714 --> 34:03.665
Put your hands behind your head.
Why?

34:04.667 --> 34:06.267
Jake.

34:10.139 --> 34:11.523
You're under arrest

34:11.525 --> 34:15.827
for the attempted murder
of Jake Riley.

34:15.829 --> 34:17.445
Aside from us, you and Jake
were the only ones

34:17.447 --> 34:18.679
who knew the plan
to come out this way.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.398
You and him.

34:21.701 --> 34:23.184
Jakey, come on, mate. You don't
believe all this rubbish,

34:23.186 --> 34:25.487
do you?
Shut up.

34:25.489 --> 34:27.237
You wrote a book
about me, Chris.

34:27.239 --> 34:30.475
My death would make it
a bestseller.

34:30.476 --> 34:33.078
You tried to kill me
for a book.

34:45.925 --> 34:48.510
<i>I'm really sorry</i>
<i>your manager lied to you.</i>

34:48.512 --> 34:51.096
At least I know what
he really thought of me.

34:53.549 --> 34:55.433
I just can't believe
I had no idea.

34:55.435 --> 34:58.386
You know, I saw him
all the time.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.939
I practically lived with him.

35:02.158 --> 35:04.559
Don't let this
change who you are.

35:04.561 --> 35:07.078
You can't stop
trusting people.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.446
Yeah, trust them
with one eye open.

35:08.448 --> 35:11.399
That sounds pretty sucky to me.
Yeah, it is.

35:11.401 --> 35:15.370
But it's part of growing up:
things get more complicated.

35:15.372 --> 35:17.756
You know, my mom,
she used to say,

35:17.758 --> 35:21.443
"Forgive, but never forget."

35:23.963 --> 35:25.380
Thank you.

35:25.382 --> 35:28.516
You're welcome.

35:28.518 --> 35:31.686
I know you were not
about to let me leave

35:31.688 --> 35:33.271
without saying good-bye.

35:35.107 --> 35:37.058
C'mon, Manslayer.

35:37.060 --> 35:39.444
Chop-chop, let's move!

35:39.446 --> 35:41.362
Come on, I ain't getting any younger.

35:44.617 --> 35:45.933
Oh.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.485
Leaving early because
of your new intern?

35:47.487 --> 35:49.788
Pardon? What intern?

35:49.790 --> 35:51.606
The dude who was
in your lab today

35:51.608 --> 35:53.107
while you were
playing cop with Cat?

35:53.109 --> 35:55.493
Everything cool?

35:55.495 --> 35:58.296
Brilliant.

35:58.298 --> 35:59.664
Manslayer.

35:59.666 --> 36:01.549
Jake Riley is not known
for his patience.

36:01.551 --> 36:03.284
Chop-chop, let's go.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.453
Pop it open.

36:05.455 --> 36:07.455
Scared there's
a dead body in there?

36:07.457 --> 36:09.174
It's cool. I already checked.
Don't worry about it.

36:09.176 --> 36:11.509
You know, I'm digging that you
are looking out for Jake Riley.

36:11.511 --> 36:12.927
It is hot.

36:12.929 --> 36:14.512
Now let's pop this chassis and
quit the chit-chat, a'ight?

36:14.514 --> 36:16.014
Oh, my God.
Yeah...

36:20.970 --> 36:23.655
You tricked out
my squad car.

36:23.657 --> 36:25.356
Yo, it's tight, huh?
Check it out...

36:26.976 --> 36:29.577
Ooh!
Oh, um...

36:30.613 --> 36:32.464
Hurry up!
Okay, okay.

36:32.466 --> 36:35.083
Sorry. Sorry.

36:35.085 --> 36:37.752
Look, I can't have my girl
serving and protecting

36:37.754 --> 36:40.004
with some carbon-dated,
terrestrial radio.

36:40.006 --> 36:42.924
Besides, I can't have you
forgetting who your man is.

36:42.926 --> 36:45.326
Now, just so you know,
it comes fully loaded--

36:45.328 --> 36:46.611
with all my greatest hits.

36:46.613 --> 36:48.296
Including a new one I think
you and Detective Chandler

36:48.298 --> 36:49.714
are really gonna like.

36:52.818 --> 37:01.342
♪

37:09.201 --> 37:11.369
Dad. Hey.

37:11.371 --> 37:13.822
Thanks for coming.

37:13.824 --> 37:16.124
Was swinging by work
when I got your text anyway.

37:19.495 --> 37:21.996
So, you left the house
pretty quickly today.

37:21.998 --> 37:23.665
Yeah.

37:23.667 --> 37:26.251
Um...

37:26.886 --> 37:29.888
I, uh...

37:29.890 --> 37:32.039
It's just that I've blamed
myself for so many years

37:32.041 --> 37:34.642
for what happened to Mom.

37:34.644 --> 37:36.210
You know?

37:36.212 --> 37:38.796
I'm the one who called her
the night she died.

37:41.717 --> 37:47.355
You know, I guess just
going through her things,

37:47.357 --> 37:51.159
I... I realized
it wasn't my fault.

37:53.612 --> 37:57.649
That when we stay stuck
in the past, we stay hurt.

37:59.919 --> 38:01.369
We stay victims.

38:01.371 --> 38:05.156
I don't want to
be that anymore.

38:07.459 --> 38:11.596
Your mother would be so proud
of what you've become.

38:11.598 --> 38:14.415
You've got her heart.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.769
In a lot of ways
I see her in you.

38:37.407 --> 38:41.042
Dad's getting married in a week.

38:41.044 --> 38:43.962
He, uh... wants to start
a fresh life.

38:47.466 --> 38:50.084
He knew you had secrets.

38:50.086 --> 38:53.671
And he tried to protect me
from them.

38:56.959 --> 38:59.143
I have to believe that...

38:59.145 --> 39:01.896
whatever you were doing,
you thought it was right.

39:03.899 --> 39:09.020
God, I want so badly
to bury this, but...

39:09.022 --> 39:11.472
you left this mess.

39:12.491 --> 39:16.143
And now I have to do

39:16.145 --> 39:19.981
everything I can
to make it right.

39:29.658 --> 39:32.427
I love you, Mom.

39:35.848 --> 39:38.266
I love you.

39:38.268 --> 39:40.885
♪

39:50.813 --> 39:53.398
We will, you know.

39:54.650 --> 39:56.684
Make it right.

39:56.686 --> 39:58.736
You heard all that?

39:58.738 --> 40:01.188
A little.

40:03.459 --> 40:06.377
Wait. The serum worked?

40:06.379 --> 40:07.829
Yeah.

40:08.999 --> 40:11.699
Ran a battery of tests...

40:11.701 --> 40:13.034
no more blackouts.

40:13.036 --> 40:15.253
No more cages.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.726
It doesn't change
what I am, though.

40:21.728 --> 40:24.312
No serum for that.

40:26.715 --> 40:28.883
Any suggestions
on how I'm supposed

40:28.885 --> 40:30.885
to move on with my life,
knowing what my mom did to you?

40:30.887 --> 40:34.188
Catherine.

40:34.190 --> 40:38.059
Your mom-- she had no idea
what she was getting into.

40:39.194 --> 40:42.063
You know, that innocent
people were gonna die.

40:45.417 --> 40:48.703
Your mom was
a brave woman.

40:48.705 --> 40:52.707
You know, she...
she really cared about us.

40:52.709 --> 40:56.911
It's just, she got backed
into a very dark corner.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.514
She kept it all from me.

40:59.516 --> 41:03.768
She lied, and that's what
I am doing to my friends.

41:03.770 --> 41:06.637
Then it's my fault.

41:06.639 --> 41:10.108
I'm the reason
you're doing all of this.

41:10.110 --> 41:11.776
No, you didn't have a choice.

41:11.778 --> 41:13.061
She did.

41:13.063 --> 41:15.196
Yeah, but if I had...

41:15.198 --> 41:17.398
I would make that
same choice again

41:17.400 --> 41:19.984
if it meant that
I could be in your life.

41:23.438 --> 41:26.090
You know, I think we've
lived with enough guilt.

41:26.092 --> 41:30.595
Maybe now it's time
to ease up on the past.

41:31.713 --> 41:33.664
What if I can't do that?

41:33.666 --> 41:36.117
You can.

41:38.470 --> 41:41.622
Because I'll do it with you.
