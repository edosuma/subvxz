00:05.118 --> 00:07.728
Previously on Mystery Incorporated...

00:07.848 --> 00:11.022
It's El Aguirre, the captain
of the Spanish conquistadors.

00:11.142 --> 00:13.418
I set the ship ashore,
on the *** coast.

00:13.538 --> 00:16.901
In a cove we named after what we would soon
bring there...

00:17.021 --> 00:18.488
Crystal Cove...

00:18.608 --> 00:20.941
I used the ***

00:21.061 --> 00:22.247
to mark my location.

00:22.367 --> 00:26.059
And we buried the evil treasure deep,
deep underground.

00:26.179 --> 00:28.870
Find the heart of the jaguar, Scooby Doo!

00:28.990 --> 00:34.071
It is the only way you shall defeat the evil
that is buried deep beneath Crystal Cove.

00:34.191 --> 00:36.000
- Zoinks!
- Freddy!

00:36.120 --> 00:37.791
You win. Take it.

00:38.188 --> 00:40.389
Auf Wiedersehen!

00:40.774 --> 00:43.439
I'm coming for you, master.

00:43.559 --> 00:46.448
I'm coming to set you free!

00:49.738 --> 00:50.823
Wow, Mayor Nettles,

00:50.942 --> 00:52.630
that was some kind of exciting.

00:52.668 --> 00:55.511
I don't think I've ever flown that
low entering U.S. airspace before.

00:55.579 --> 00:58.215
Uh, Fred, let's not
mention that to anyone, ok?

00:58.282 --> 01:00.083
Especially homeland security.

01:00.151 --> 01:02.552
Now, you kids take good care
of that spear thingy.

01:02.619 --> 01:03.920
Seriously?

01:03.988 --> 01:06.156
It's called the heart
of the jaguar.

01:06.224 --> 01:07.991
Exactly.

01:12.396 --> 01:16.199
Like, watching a big, majestic
plane soar off into the heavens,

01:16.267 --> 01:19.102
hee hee hee, it makes
me feel a need.

01:19.170 --> 01:21.338
I feel the need for...

01:21.405 --> 01:23.173
- Pizza.
- Like, Scoob,

01:23.241 --> 01:24.674
is there any other need?

01:24.742 --> 01:26.509
Yeah. The need
for ice cream

01:26.577 --> 01:30.513
and cookies and Scooby snacks
and more Scooby snacks.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.755
What happened to the street?

01:38.822 --> 01:41.424
It looks like
some kind of earthquake.

01:44.595 --> 01:48.198
Like, zoinks.
Where is everybody?

01:53.570 --> 01:55.305
They're gone!

01:55.373 --> 01:59.042
Everyone! Gone!

02:29.740 --> 02:32.742
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

02:39.032 --> 02:41.293
Sheriff, what happened
to everyone?

02:41.413 --> 02:43.216
There I was,
talking to my deputy,

02:43.278 --> 02:45.713
and whoosh!
He was gone.

02:45.781 --> 02:48.716
Pulled down below.

02:48.784 --> 02:51.118
Please, Bronson,
you're scaring me.

02:51.186 --> 02:53.020
I'm scaring myself.

02:53.088 --> 02:54.321
And I hate it.

02:54.390 --> 02:56.123
I hate it!

02:56.191 --> 02:58.025
Make it stop!

03:04.032 --> 03:05.533
- Aah!
- Aah!

03:05.601 --> 03:08.002
- Sheriff!
- Mayor Nettles!

03:08.069 --> 03:09.504
Something pulled them under.

03:09.571 --> 03:11.372
Don't move.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.775
Or breathe.

03:13.842 --> 03:15.976
Scooby's right.
Whatever's down there

03:16.044 --> 03:18.245
seems to be attracted
to movement and sound.

03:18.313 --> 03:20.815
Everyone stay perfectly still.

03:30.426 --> 03:32.059
Jinkies! My mom!

03:32.127 --> 03:34.562
We left her at
the broken spine.

03:37.466 --> 03:38.599
Mom!

03:38.667 --> 03:40.100
Mom!

03:43.739 --> 03:45.172
She's gone.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.408
We'll find her, Velm,
and bring her back.

03:47.476 --> 03:48.876
We'll bring them all back.

03:48.944 --> 03:53.080
Yeah,.
But, like, back from where?

03:53.148 --> 03:55.015
Focus, people.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.584
There are lives at stake.

03:56.652 --> 03:59.687
Something has taken my mom
and the rest of Crystal Cove.

03:59.755 --> 04:02.957
It even took my Nova
from the hospital.

04:03.024 --> 04:04.459
What kind of horrible monster

04:04.526 --> 04:06.694
would snatch a sweet
little dog in a coma?

04:06.762 --> 04:08.896
I know.

04:08.964 --> 04:11.566
Nova! Nova!

04:11.633 --> 04:13.468
Quick, Scoob.
Drown your sorrows

04:13.535 --> 04:16.603
in this pint of triple fudge
cookie dough caramel chip.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.908
Thanks, Raggy.
I needed that.

04:20.976 --> 04:22.309
As I was saying,

04:22.377 --> 04:24.411
I suspect this mystery
is connected

04:24.480 --> 04:26.714
to the evil entity
buried under Crystal Cove.

04:26.782 --> 04:28.048
Like, hold on.

04:28.116 --> 04:30.184
You said you didn't
buy into all this stuff.

04:30.251 --> 04:32.419
Well, I still don't.

04:32.488 --> 04:35.322
But my mom helped me
see the light and be more open.

04:35.390 --> 04:36.958
Maybe this is all
science fiction,

04:37.025 --> 04:40.795
but a lot of science fiction
turns out to be science fact.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.731
They laughed at Jules Verne
when he wrote about submarines

04:43.799 --> 04:45.132
and going to the moon.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.602
Like, they used submarines
to go to the moon?

04:47.669 --> 04:48.970
I guess so.

04:49.037 --> 04:50.404
One thing is clear,

04:50.472 --> 04:53.474
this isn't the boogeyman,
a vampire, werewolves,

04:53.542 --> 04:55.175
or an evil leprechaun.

04:55.243 --> 04:58.012
This is an extra dimensional
intelligent being we're facing.

04:58.079 --> 04:59.246
It's real.

04:59.314 --> 05:00.242
Wow, Velm.

05:00.362 --> 05:02.909
Like, that must have been
some talk with your mom.

05:03.029 --> 05:05.416
It made me remember
that the advanced sciences

05:05.536 --> 05:08.441
have long accepted the possibility
of other dimension.

05:08.679 --> 05:11.092
Now I guess things have gotten a lot less
theoretical.

05:11.212 --> 05:14.142
So you think having the evil intelligence
under Crystal Cove

05:14.262 --> 05:16.030
could be why this town
that is so weird?

05:16.097 --> 05:18.868
Yes. And the weirdness
is escalating

05:18.988 --> 05:21.936
because the time of Nibiru
is upon us.

05:23.539 --> 05:26.607
I discovered that my computer
model of the planispheric disk

05:26.675 --> 05:29.276
perfectly mirrors the planets
in our solar system.

05:29.344 --> 05:31.979
You can see they're
coming into direct alignment.

05:32.047 --> 05:34.281
Plus, there is
a tenth planet...

05:34.349 --> 05:35.583
Planet "X".

05:35.651 --> 05:36.984
It's getting closer,

05:37.052 --> 05:40.021
about to come into alignment
behind Pluto.

05:40.088 --> 05:42.857
It will cause a massive
gravitational disruption

05:42.925 --> 05:45.359
not seen in 5,000 years.

05:45.427 --> 05:47.929
The time of Nibiru
happens in two days.

05:47.996 --> 05:50.364
And it's this disruption
that makes the fabric

05:50.432 --> 05:53.500
between dimensions of
time and space extremely weak.

05:53.569 --> 05:57.572
That's why the evil thing
buried beneath Crystal Cove

05:57.639 --> 05:59.339
must be destroyed.

05:59.407 --> 06:01.475
We know that the heart
of the jaguar

06:01.543 --> 06:04.144
is supposed to be able
to destroy this evil entity

06:04.212 --> 06:05.713
and undo all of its evil.

06:05.781 --> 06:07.848
We also know
the Spanish conquistadors

06:07.916 --> 06:10.350
used the planispheric disk
to map the entity's

06:10.418 --> 06:11.886
double-triple secret
location.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.221
Plus, the planispheric disk
showed us the location

06:14.289 --> 06:15.355
of four keys.

06:15.423 --> 06:17.391
The old pistol, the helmet,

06:17.459 --> 06:20.995
the mortar bowl thingy,
and a piece of old sail cloth.

06:21.063 --> 06:24.732
It feels like we know a lot
and nothing at the same time.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.333
Like, welcome to our world.

06:26.401 --> 06:28.168
Ha ha ha!
Right, Scooby-Doo?

06:28.236 --> 06:30.437
Yeah, we also know nothing.

06:30.505 --> 06:31.839
And we love it.

06:31.907 --> 06:34.274
* We know nothing
and we love it *

06:34.342 --> 06:36.611
Yeah! Ha!

06:36.678 --> 06:38.846
* We know nothing
and we love it *

06:38.914 --> 06:39.947
Yeah! Ha!
Yeah! Ha!

06:40.015 --> 06:42.149
Shaggy, Scooby, stop!

06:42.217 --> 06:43.751
Don't move.

06:43.819 --> 06:46.253
Aah!

07:06.262 --> 07:09.531
Like, I think it's gone.

07:12.259 --> 07:14.336
Or not.

07:16.773 --> 07:18.673
Kriegstoppabots.

07:18.741 --> 07:20.942
Ohh!

07:21.378 --> 07:23.964
You robots made a big mistake.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.844
This is my house.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.851
- Huh?
- Huh?

07:36.122 --> 07:39.391
Professor Pericles'
evil robots.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.759
I should have known.

07:40.827 --> 07:41.994
If they're coming
from underground,

07:42.062 --> 07:43.495
there's only one thing
we can do.

07:43.563 --> 07:45.263
Like, stay above ground?

07:45.331 --> 07:47.833
No, we're gonna get
to the bottom of this mystery.

07:47.901 --> 07:51.436
Like, ooh, boy.

07:59.378 --> 08:02.481
It looks like this tunnel's
been freshly dug.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.516
Like, by those crazy
German robots.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.659
They're all identical.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.261
Maybe we should split up.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.896
Hmm.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.698
Scooby, what is it?

08:19.766 --> 08:21.767
- Do you hear something?
- Lots of somethings.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.002
This way.

08:28.642 --> 08:32.144
Like,

08:37.116 --> 08:39.284
There's Mr. E.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.921
The rest of the original Mystery
Incorporated must be in that tent.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.322
And look.

08:44.390 --> 08:48.460
Jeepers!
It's our parents.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.462
Nova.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.597
We have to save them.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.701
Easy, Scoob. We will, but we
have to be smart about this.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.369
We need to think
things through.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.471
Let's see if we can
work our way closer

08:59.539 --> 09:01.473
so we can get more intel.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.623
Uhh!

09:18.692 --> 09:19.725
Ahh!

09:19.793 --> 09:21.160
Oh, please, Bronson.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.062
They're not even whipping you.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.600
Good thing I had Jason Wyatt

09:28.668 --> 09:31.937
help me install this sound
amplifying antenna in my binoculars.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.271
Let's listen in.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.874
There's been so sign
of her for weeks.

09:37.811 --> 09:38.851
Who are you looking for?

09:38.912 --> 09:39.912
Cassidy.

09:39.979 --> 09:41.413
Maybe she finally gave up.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.182
No, she would never give up.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.449
She's gone.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.585
Of course she's gone.

09:46.652 --> 09:50.288
Anyone who crosses me
gets eliminated.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.124
Um, Professor Pericles,

09:52.192 --> 09:53.992
you promised you would
surgically alter me

09:54.060 --> 09:55.861
back to my stunning self
by now.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.796
I'm so old like this.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.765
How long do you plan
on making me suffer?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.800
I don't have time
for such things.

10:01.868 --> 10:05.537
The treasure is almost
within our gasp.

10:05.605 --> 10:09.174
Besides, I'm the one
who's suffering, not you, Judy.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.543
How are you suffering, Brad?

10:11.611 --> 10:16.115
Well, I'm the one who has to
look at you all day every day.

10:16.182 --> 10:20.919
That was very hurtful, Brad.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.621
I'm sorry, Judy.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.456
I mean, grandma.

10:24.523 --> 10:27.525
Well, at least
I'm not walking around

10:27.593 --> 10:30.062
with that
outrageous chin, Bradley.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.831
Look at you,
you're all coming unraveled.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.833
The closer we get
to that treasure,

10:34.901 --> 10:37.369
the more the curse takes over.

10:37.436 --> 10:41.640
Cassidy was right.
She was right all along.

10:41.707 --> 10:45.410
Like, the old Mystery Incorporated
dudes are totally losing it.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.554
Zeek! Zeek!

10:58.091 --> 11:00.625
The time has almost arrived.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.398
Focus all the digging
on that spot.

11:06.465 --> 11:09.434
And, Ricky, when
the entrance is found,

11:09.502 --> 11:12.370
have my kriegstoppabots
destroy all the workers.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.606
They have outlived
their usefulness.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.008
You monster.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.442
I'm not your trained monkey.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.811
I won't do it.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.413
I won't be a part of
this madness anymore.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.049
Aah! Aah! Aah!

11:29.022 --> 11:32.057
Yes, pro...master.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.591
Whatever you command.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.393
I will have...

11:35.461 --> 11:38.697
the kriegstoppabots
destroy them all.

11:38.764 --> 11:41.533
Not one person
from Crystal Cove

11:41.600 --> 11:43.668
will be left alive.

12:04.819 --> 12:06.302
We're running out of time.

12:06.398 --> 12:08.098
We have to find
the crystal sarcophagus

12:08.166 --> 12:09.533
and destroy the evil entity

12:09.601 --> 12:11.669
before Pericles gets
his dirty little beak on it.

12:11.736 --> 12:12.969
First things first,

12:13.037 --> 12:14.771
we've got to find
a way to stop them

12:14.839 --> 12:17.441
before they destroy my mom
and everyone else we know.

12:17.509 --> 12:20.678
Like, yeah. We have to say our
fellow Crystal Cove-ites.

12:20.745 --> 12:23.180
Actually, Shaggy,
I think it's Crystal Covians.

12:23.248 --> 12:25.749
Covians? Hmm, that
doesn't sound right.

12:25.817 --> 12:28.185
I think it's Crystal Covers.

12:28.253 --> 12:30.721
Whatever!
We have to save them!

12:30.788 --> 12:33.557
How? There are over
200 well-armed kriegstoppabots

12:33.625 --> 12:35.359
down there and just 5 of us.

12:35.427 --> 12:39.363
Plus, there's thousands of Crystal
Cove-ite-rians in chains.

12:39.431 --> 12:42.833
It's like one mega danger zone
slash battlefield down there.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.102
Shaggy, that's it.

12:45.169 --> 12:48.004
Like, what's it? I don't
even know what I said.

12:48.072 --> 12:51.242
It's one big danger zone
slash battlefield.

12:51.309 --> 12:53.043
And, gang, we're
taking it over.

12:53.111 --> 12:55.779
That tunnel is a run-off channel
of the Crystal Cove river.

12:55.847 --> 12:58.282
I can drive the Mystery Machine
right in through there.

12:58.350 --> 13:00.817
If we coordinate an uprising
with the townspeople,

13:00.885 --> 13:03.153
along with a well-planned
attack by the Mystery Machine...

13:03.221 --> 13:05.789
We might just have a chance.

13:07.225 --> 13:08.825
Freddy, what is it?

13:08.893 --> 13:11.662
Daphne, I don't want
to waste anymore time.

13:11.730 --> 13:14.298
I know how precious that is,
how precious you are.

13:14.366 --> 13:17.968
I just want to say, in case none
of us make it through this alive...

13:18.035 --> 13:20.671
Freddy, no. I...

13:20.739 --> 13:22.439
Daphne, I want to say it.

13:22.507 --> 13:24.375
I love you, Daphne Blake.

13:24.442 --> 13:26.744
You're my girl
and always will be.

13:26.811 --> 13:28.512
I haven't always
been able to tell you.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.282
In fact, I've been kind of
stupid about my emotions and...

13:31.349 --> 13:32.750
No, Freddy. Hush.

13:32.817 --> 13:34.351
You've been perfect.

13:34.419 --> 13:35.819
A lot of it was my fault.

13:35.887 --> 13:37.521
I put a lot of pressure on you.

13:37.589 --> 13:38.789
It wasn't fair.

13:38.856 --> 13:40.090
I'm sorry.

13:40.158 --> 13:42.993
You've always been
so wonderful.

13:45.830 --> 13:47.864
Mmm.

13:47.932 --> 13:50.634
Ok, gang.
Somebody has to go down

13:50.702 --> 13:52.936
to spread the word and coordinate
the prisoner uprising.

13:53.004 --> 13:54.338
Like, I'll do it.

13:54.406 --> 13:55.972
You? You will?

13:56.040 --> 13:57.608
Yeah, I will.

13:57.676 --> 14:00.511
But, like, what's that
crazy, strange feeling

14:00.578 --> 14:02.145
all over my midsection?

14:02.213 --> 14:03.180
Courage.

14:03.247 --> 14:05.616
Courage.
Ha ha ha.

14:05.684 --> 14:08.385
Like, who knew?
It's awesome.

14:08.453 --> 14:09.453
Count me in.

14:09.521 --> 14:12.456
Wherever Shaggy goes, I go.

14:22.434 --> 14:25.035
Oh!

14:32.477 --> 14:35.679
Huh? Ahh!

14:35.747 --> 14:38.382
Ohh!

15:04.542 --> 15:06.343
We're busting out of here soon.

15:06.411 --> 15:09.045
Like, be ready
and spread the word.

15:09.113 --> 15:13.751
Big crazy uprising. Be ready
and bring everyone you know.

15:16.888 --> 15:19.490
Mrs. Dinkley,
glad you're ok.

15:19.557 --> 15:22.893
We're taking over later.
Be ready.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.028
Mom, dad, be ready.

15:25.096 --> 15:29.266
Like, we're gonna bust
everyone out.

15:40.311 --> 15:42.713
The Crystal Cove-ite or -ians
are ready.

15:42.781 --> 15:45.215
The uprising should be
happening any minute now.

15:45.283 --> 15:48.151
- Bring it.
- Huh?

16:02.634 --> 16:05.068
The doorway at last.

16:05.136 --> 16:09.139
Now I can finally claim
what is rightfully mine...

16:09.206 --> 16:11.742
ultimate power!

16:11.810 --> 16:16.413
Like, Scoob, that is
one big, crazy door.

16:20.151 --> 16:22.453
Like, danger. Danger.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.421
Run, will Robinson.

16:24.489 --> 16:25.823
Like, run.

16:25.890 --> 16:29.793
Kriegstoppabots, destroy him.

16:29.861 --> 16:30.961
Ohh.

16:31.028 --> 16:34.230
Oh!

16:40.705 --> 16:41.972
Now's the time.

16:42.039 --> 16:44.007
Somebody's got to start
the uprising.

16:44.075 --> 16:46.409
Looks like that somebody's
got to be me.

16:46.478 --> 16:48.946
No, Bronson,
it's too dangerous.

16:49.013 --> 16:50.380
I have to.

16:50.448 --> 16:53.951
For all the times I wasn't
the best sheriff.

16:54.018 --> 16:57.020
For all the times
I arrested the wrong guy.

16:57.088 --> 17:02.092
For all the times I need you to
know how much I care about you.

17:02.159 --> 17:06.762
I have to because
I love you, Janet Mayor Nettles.

17:08.199 --> 17:09.366
Mwah.

17:09.433 --> 17:12.035
Ok, people, rise up!

17:12.103 --> 17:15.438
Throw off your chains.
Attack!

17:39.463 --> 17:41.498
Like, mommy!

17:41.566 --> 17:47.004
Shaggy! No!

17:47.839 --> 17:49.540
You mess with my Shaggy,

17:49.607 --> 17:52.242
you mess with me.

18:02.119 --> 18:03.253
I...oh.

18:08.292 --> 18:09.693
Ahh!

18:18.803 --> 18:20.938
Like, Scoob, pal, you did it.

18:21.005 --> 18:23.974
You saved me! It's ok.
It's ok, buddy.

18:24.042 --> 18:25.876
Good boy.
Down, boy.

18:25.944 --> 18:27.644
Easy, boy.

18:27.712 --> 18:31.448
They drew first blood, not me.

18:32.884 --> 18:34.451
It's not over yet.

18:34.518 --> 18:36.987
We have to get
these people to safety.

18:37.055 --> 18:38.555
Listen up, everybody.

18:38.623 --> 18:43.126
Follow me to freedom!

18:43.194 --> 18:47.163
And will somebody please bring that
sweet little dog in a coma? Thanks.

19:21.365 --> 19:24.234
Goodbye, beautiful.

19:25.336 --> 19:26.503
Dah.

19:30.675 --> 19:32.876
Freddy! Velma!

19:32.944 --> 19:34.377
Daphne!

19:34.445 --> 19:37.614
No!

19:52.196 --> 19:53.396
Huh?

19:55.733 --> 19:57.233
You're ok?

19:57.301 --> 19:59.502
But, like, if you're in here,

19:59.570 --> 20:01.237
who's in there?

20:01.305 --> 20:04.641
Nobody. It was all a part
of Fred's well-planned attack.

20:04.709 --> 20:07.377
I rigged up a standard
Fitzheimer remote control

20:07.444 --> 20:09.780
in your mom's car
so we'd be able

20:09.847 --> 20:13.516
to attack the kriegstoppabots without
putting my Daphne in harm's way.

20:13.584 --> 20:15.218
Oh, and you, too, Velma.

20:15.286 --> 20:17.821
Be still my heart.

20:23.594 --> 20:25.929
Oh, my gosh, gang.

20:25.997 --> 20:27.530
What have I done?

20:27.598 --> 20:28.899
What you had to do.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.500
What you always do.

20:30.568 --> 20:34.437
Turned traps into
a fighting chance to live.

20:36.307 --> 20:40.877
All my years of searching
to find this door.

20:40.945 --> 20:42.746
I have done it.

20:42.814 --> 20:46.016
It will lead us
to the treasure and more.

20:46.084 --> 20:48.085
Soon, very soon,

20:48.152 --> 20:51.421
the world as we know it
will never be the same again.

21:09.306 --> 21:11.608
Professor, won't the kids
just follow us in?

21:11.675 --> 21:13.043
Yes, they will.

21:13.111 --> 21:14.978
And I need them to.

21:15.046 --> 21:16.446
I need Scooby-Doo.

21:16.513 --> 21:19.315
If I'm to take control
of the great power below,

21:19.383 --> 21:21.451
the dog must be destroyed

21:21.518 --> 21:23.820
at just the right moment.

21:23.888 --> 21:26.489
Come, my destiny awaits.

21:45.442 --> 21:50.413
All right, gang, now let's see where
this uber mystery really leads.

21:50.481 --> 21:51.614
Ready?

21:51.682 --> 21:52.916
- Ready.
- Like, ready.

21:52.984 --> 21:54.251
Ready.

21:54.318 --> 21:56.653
Professor Pericles
is gonna regret the day

21:56.720 --> 22:00.857
he ever messed with
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
