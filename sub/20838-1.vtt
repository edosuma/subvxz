00:27.425 --> 00:30.085
And in all of my
years of public life,

00:30.094 --> 00:32.862
I have never obstructed justice.

00:32.863 --> 00:35.197
And I think, too,
that I can say,

00:35.198 --> 00:37.498
That in my years of public life,

00:37.500 --> 00:39.870
That I welcome
this kind of examination

00:39.871 --> 00:41.369
Because people have got to know

00:41.370 --> 00:43.770
Whether or not their
president is a crook.

00:43.772 --> 00:44.902
Well, I'm not a crook.

00:55.983 --> 00:57.723
To share with you what
the United States knows

00:57.724 --> 01:00.918
About Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction,

01:00.921 --> 01:02.251
Every statement I make today

01:02.255 --> 01:05.315
Is backed up by sources,
solid sources.

01:05.324 --> 01:07.124
These are not assertions.

01:07.125 --> 01:08.515
What we're giving you are facts

01:08.526 --> 01:11.556
And conclusions based
on solid intelligence.

01:30.345 --> 01:33.675
Renewed hostile actions
against United States ships

01:33.682 --> 01:36.682
On the high seas
in the gulf of tonkin

01:36.685 --> 01:38.445
Have today required me

01:38.453 --> 01:42.022
To order the military forces
of the United States

01:42.023 --> 01:43.863
To take action in reply.

01:47.627 --> 01:49.557
So, what I wanted to see

01:49.563 --> 01:52.603
Is if you could give me a yes
or no answer to the question:

01:52.604 --> 01:57.336
Does the NSA collect
any type of data at all

01:57.337 --> 02:00.767
On millions or hundreds
of millions of Americans?

02:01.739 --> 02:03.739
No, sir.

02:03.742 --> 02:05.112
It does not?

02:06.143 --> 02:07.583
Not wittingly.

02:11.513 --> 02:13.653
You have to get rid
of this ignorant

02:13.654 --> 02:15.479
And meddlesome majority.

02:17.585 --> 02:20.285
Control them, make sure
they do the right things

02:20.288 --> 02:22.348
All for their
own good, incidentally.

02:22.356 --> 02:23.956
If they're allowed
to participate,

02:23.957 --> 02:26.517
They'll make all kind
of mistakes, errors,

02:26.526 --> 02:29.756
But we, the responsible men,

02:29.762 --> 02:31.931
We know how to do
the right thing

02:31.932 --> 02:33.600
Like get into the Vietnam war

02:33.601 --> 02:37.228
And invade Iraq and
deregulate the banks

02:37.234 --> 02:38.471
So that everything crashes.

02:38.472 --> 02:39.968
We... we get
everything straight.

02:42.204 --> 02:45.206
My fellow citizens,
at this hour,

02:45.207 --> 02:47.137
American and coalition forces

02:47.142 --> 02:49.982
Are in the early stages
of military operations

02:49.983 --> 02:51.378
To disarm Iraq,

02:51.379 --> 02:52.779
To free its people,

02:52.780 --> 02:55.350
And to defend the world
from grave danger.

03:20.103 --> 03:21.970
I believe, very deeply,

03:21.971 --> 03:23.301
In freedom of the press

03:23.305 --> 03:26.135
And the role of press
in a free society,

03:26.141 --> 03:28.809
And I have ever
since I was a kid.

03:28.810 --> 03:31.910
You can't fulfill your
function unless you're free.

03:33.746 --> 03:37.076
One of the great reporters of
the 20th century, I.F. Stone,

03:37.083 --> 03:39.583
Told journalism students
never to forget

03:39.585 --> 03:41.545
That all governments lie.

03:41.553 --> 03:43.291
He could speak with authority,

03:43.292 --> 03:46.218
Having spent seven decades
exposing deception

03:46.224 --> 03:47.557
And official lies

03:47.558 --> 03:49.718
By digging deep into
government documents

03:49.726 --> 03:50.756
And transcripts.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.490
I tried to prove
what I was saying

03:53.496 --> 03:54.956
From the horse's
mouth, as it were.

03:54.964 --> 03:56.804
Using the government's
own documents,

03:56.805 --> 04:00.229
Government reports
and transcripts

04:00.235 --> 04:02.095
And press conferences, speeches,

04:02.103 --> 04:05.772
And analyzing them the way...
the way a historian would.

04:05.773 --> 04:07.873
He gained his
greatest fame and impact

04:07.875 --> 04:11.605
Publishing a newsletter called
"I.F. Stone's weekly."

04:11.612 --> 04:14.750
Everybody in government
and journalism knew Izzy stone

04:14.751 --> 04:15.948
And read his stuff.

04:15.949 --> 04:18.519
I.F. Stone's weekly
is about this size.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.848
Well, I.F. Stone's weekly
was a classic example

04:21.853 --> 04:26.357
Of an independent
journalistic organization

04:26.358 --> 04:28.488
That was able
to report the truth

04:28.493 --> 04:31.328
And that's the way
alternative media,

04:31.329 --> 04:33.059
Which I really think,
is real journalism

04:33.064 --> 04:36.499
Has always worked as a vehicle

04:36.500 --> 04:39.969
That has exposed the collusion,

04:39.970 --> 04:43.370
Hypocrisy and lies of
the commercial media.

04:44.839 --> 04:48.639
Do you presume to
criticize the great oz,

04:48.642 --> 04:51.276
You ungrateful creatures?

04:51.277 --> 04:54.107
I mean, stone was kind
of like Toto, you know.

04:54.113 --> 04:57.313
It was like his job was
to pull back the curtain.

04:57.316 --> 05:00.346
The great oz has spoken.

05:00.917 --> 05:02.247
Oh!

05:02.252 --> 05:05.652
Pay no attention to that
man behind the curtain!

05:05.655 --> 05:07.445
And to see what
was behind that curtain

05:07.456 --> 05:08.916
And what was behind
that curtain, yes,

05:08.924 --> 05:10.594
It was the
all-powerful oz.

05:10.595 --> 05:13.492
It was also just
a frightened little man.

05:13.494 --> 05:16.464
Nothing and nothing that any
of us need to be frightened of,

05:16.465 --> 05:19.201
And why are... why are
we frightened of that?

05:19.202 --> 05:22.829
That's the embodiment of what
he and his weekly stood for

05:22.835 --> 05:25.795
And it certainly was
a huge inspiration to me.

05:42.887 --> 05:46.417
I want surveillance
of certain mosques, okay?

05:46.423 --> 05:49.223
I watched in
jersey city, new jersey,

05:49.225 --> 05:54.155
Where thousands and thousands
of people were cheering

05:54.162 --> 05:56.562
As that building
was coming down.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.198
Donald J. Trump is
calling for a total

05:59.199 --> 06:04.236
And complete shutdown of Muslims
entering the United States

06:04.237 --> 06:09.337
Until our country's
representatives can figure out

06:09.341 --> 06:11.511
What the hell is going on.

06:18.114 --> 06:19.747
You have no choice.

06:19.748 --> 06:22.478
Who would have thought that
this circus would come to town,

06:22.484 --> 06:25.384
But you know, it may
not be good for America,

06:25.386 --> 06:26.916
But it's damn good for CBS,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.389
That's all I got to say.

06:28.390 --> 06:30.088
The money's rolling in
and this is fun.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.019
I've never seen
anything like this,

06:32.024 --> 06:34.794
And you know, this is gonna
be a very good year for us.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.430
It's a terrible thing to say,

06:36.431 --> 06:38.327
But bring it on,
Donald, go ahead.

06:38.328 --> 06:39.388
Keep going.

06:39.395 --> 06:42.655
It makes you ask, seriously,

06:42.664 --> 06:47.166
Whether those executives
who run media conglomerates

06:47.167 --> 06:49.667
Have any more ethics or morals

06:49.669 --> 06:53.269
Than those who run
the oil and gas industry,

06:53.272 --> 06:56.272
The pharmaceutical companies,
the tobacco industry.

06:56.275 --> 06:58.005
It's an open question to me.

We're in new Hampshire,

07:37.075 --> 07:39.805
Which is like, the capital
of depressed America, where,

07:39.811 --> 07:42.241
You know, the manufacturing
economy has disappeared,

07:42.246 --> 07:44.806
And we really don't examine
those issues at all.

07:44.815 --> 07:47.775
We don't actually
talk to people at all,

07:47.784 --> 07:49.184
'cause you don't have time.

07:49.185 --> 07:51.845
There's only time
to watch the speech,

07:51.854 --> 07:54.121
To ask the people
in the audience

07:54.122 --> 07:55.292
What they think of the speech

07:55.293 --> 07:56.519
And then you go on

07:56.523 --> 07:57.863
And you move on
to the next spot.

07:57.864 --> 08:00.057
The entire thing could be shot

08:00.059 --> 08:03.089
In a sound stage in la with...

08:03.095 --> 08:06.125
Just by rotating in
a different audience each time.

08:37.528 --> 08:38.828
Well, Donald trump, of course,

08:38.828 --> 08:40.629
Remains the strong
frontrunner up here

08:40.630 --> 08:42.700
To win the republican primary
in new Hampshire tomorrow.

08:42.701 --> 08:43.928
It snows in new Hampshire,

08:43.932 --> 08:45.432
People know how
to put... get cars.

08:45.433 --> 08:46.673
They got... they used
to put chains on,

08:46.674 --> 08:48.267
Now they got good tires.

08:48.268 --> 08:50.498
Why should they trudge through
the snow for Donald trump?

08:50.503 --> 08:51.872
Well, you know, my whole concept

08:51.873 --> 08:53.540
And my whole theme,
frankly, behind it

08:53.541 --> 08:55.169
Is make America great again.

08:55.173 --> 08:56.973
Make America great again!

08:56.974 --> 08:59.144
We're going to make
America great again!

08:59.145 --> 09:02.177
We're going to make
America great again.

09:02.178 --> 09:03.608
Build a wall!

09:03.612 --> 09:05.352
Build a wall!

09:10.283 --> 09:12.053
I'm very focused on the idea

09:12.054 --> 09:14.690
That these voters have
completely shifted their tune

09:14.691 --> 09:16.187
About what they're upset about.

09:17.422 --> 09:20.122
But you know, there's
a lot of subtleties

09:20.125 --> 09:22.755
That people in this kind of
audience don't pick up on,

09:22.760 --> 09:24.429
And he's smart enough to know

09:24.430 --> 09:26.958
That he can just steamroll right
past a lot of those problems

09:26.963 --> 09:28.663
And they're not going
to be noticed by anybody.

09:28.664 --> 09:30.234
Thank you very much, everybody.

09:30.235 --> 09:31.862
Wow, this is beautiful.

09:55.622 --> 09:56.822
We had a lot of fun.

09:56.823 --> 09:58.192
We gave very
high grades on that.

09:58.193 --> 10:00.521
Even people that hate me
gave me good marks,

10:00.526 --> 10:01.886
Isn't that amazing?

10:01.894 --> 10:03.361
For the next 20 minutes,

10:03.362 --> 10:05.100
He's talking about how
he's gonna slap tariffs

10:05.101 --> 10:06.997
On every country that
imports to the United States

10:06.998 --> 10:08.898
And yeah, how he's,
you know, ford is gonna...

10:08.899 --> 10:11.467
Want to relocate
a factory and he's...

10:11.468 --> 10:12.968
He, Donald trump, the president,

10:12.969 --> 10:14.199
Is not going to allow that.

10:14.203 --> 10:15.703
The idea of giving
the government

10:15.704 --> 10:19.239
That much power over...
over corporate business

10:19.240 --> 10:21.170
Doesn't seem to trouble
this audience at all,

10:21.175 --> 10:23.605
Which is odd when you
think about it after...

10:23.610 --> 10:25.740
After all those
years of propaganda.

10:25.745 --> 10:27.335
For years and years and years,

10:27.346 --> 10:30.446
What was the party line that
we got was that, you know,

10:30.449 --> 10:31.709
Free enterprise cures all.

10:31.716 --> 10:32.976
The market is
self-correcting.

10:32.983 --> 10:34.383
We're the best in the world.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.118
We have confidence
we're gonna do that.

10:36.119 --> 10:37.819
Well, that's not what
he's saying anymore.

10:37.820 --> 10:39.550
People don't have
confidence in that anymore.

10:39.555 --> 10:40.885
Now they need...

10:40.889 --> 10:42.719
Now they need the
strong man to step in

10:42.724 --> 10:44.924
And make sure
that we all get paid.

10:44.926 --> 10:48.456
I'll bring back our jobs
from china, from Mexico,

10:48.462 --> 10:51.096
From japan, from so many places.

10:51.097 --> 10:53.997
I'll bring back our jobs
and I'll bring back our money.

10:55.799 --> 10:58.868
Matt Taibbi's acerbic
writing on Donald trump

10:58.869 --> 11:02.738
Is really reminiscent
of I.F. Stone's writing

11:02.739 --> 11:05.869
On the demagogue
senator Joe McCarthy,

11:05.875 --> 11:10.005
And presidents like
Ike Eisenhower, john f. Kennedy,

11:10.011 --> 11:12.611
Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon.

11:14.748 --> 11:16.948
Matt is sort of a cross
between I.F. Stone

11:16.950 --> 11:20.180
And Hunter S. Thompson,
the original gonzo journalist,

11:20.186 --> 11:22.886
Who so raucously, viscerally,

11:22.888 --> 11:24.788
Would skewer the
powers that were

11:24.789 --> 11:26.049
In the early '70s.

11:26.855 --> 11:29.015
And as Izzy was drowned out

11:29.024 --> 11:31.994
When mainstream media gave
Joe McCarthy his megaphone,

11:31.995 --> 11:35.893
Taibbi's independent voice
can't really compete

11:35.896 --> 11:38.796
When mainstream
TV news, for months,

11:38.798 --> 11:41.298
Provided a fairly
uncritical platform

11:41.300 --> 11:44.100
And a massive
megaphone to trump.

11:44.102 --> 11:46.802
When do we beat
Mexico at the border?

11:46.804 --> 11:49.044
They're laughing at us
at our stupidity.

11:49.045 --> 11:50.939
They're bringing drugs.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.607
They're bringing crime.

11:52.608 --> 11:56.808
They're rapists and some,
I assume, are good people.

12:22.069 --> 12:24.269
We spent about a year
doing this story,

12:24.271 --> 12:28.007
And we found evidence
that bodies, human bodies,

12:28.008 --> 12:31.308
Were buried in,
I would say, a criminal way.

12:41.119 --> 12:43.419
If we had 200 bodies that
were buried in a criminal way

12:43.421 --> 12:45.951
In the United States,
if they were Anglo,

12:45.956 --> 12:47.586
I think that we'd
be hearing about it.

12:47.590 --> 12:49.057
Because they're Mexican,

12:49.058 --> 12:50.658
Or because they're
from south of the border,

12:50.659 --> 12:51.989
For the most part,

12:51.993 --> 12:53.393
There wasn't any
sort of an uproar.

12:53.394 --> 12:54.964
The national media
didn't pay attention.

12:54.965 --> 12:58.062
We found mass graves
in the United States.

12:58.065 --> 13:01.465
We found people dumped
into a mass grave,

13:01.468 --> 13:02.528
And they were not catalogued.

13:02.535 --> 13:03.725
They were not documented,

13:03.736 --> 13:05.136
They were not properly treated.

13:05.137 --> 13:07.297
Some individuals were
buried in trash bags.

13:13.676 --> 13:15.076
The mainstream media,

13:15.078 --> 13:16.908
If we're talking about
national media coverage

13:16.913 --> 13:19.313
Of the migrant deaths
in Falfurrias, Texas,

13:19.315 --> 13:22.245
To my knowledge has
been non-existent.

13:22.251 --> 13:24.520
Media executives,
for the most part,

13:24.521 --> 13:27.789
People who make decisions
on what's on television,

13:27.790 --> 13:29.948
Are really some of the
most ill-informed people

13:29.956 --> 13:31.786
When it comes
to the news itself.

13:32.557 --> 13:33.887
The choices that are made

13:33.892 --> 13:35.792
Are entertainment based.

13:35.793 --> 13:36.993
Who's pretty?

13:36.994 --> 13:38.163
Who speaks English?

13:38.164 --> 13:39.961
These are things that I'm asked

13:39.962 --> 13:41.392
When I'm pitching a story.

13:41.396 --> 13:43.496
They're not going to
watch a bunch of bodies

13:43.498 --> 13:45.258
Being exhumed from a grave-site

13:45.266 --> 13:47.196
And seeing law enforcement
held accountable.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.770
That's not something
that's savory,

13:48.771 --> 13:51.569
And I'm talking about all
of the mainstream media

13:51.571 --> 13:52.837
On major networks.

13:52.838 --> 13:55.306
ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS.

13:55.307 --> 13:58.876
We're being dumbed down,
we're being watered down,

13:58.877 --> 14:02.507
We're being misinformed,
we're being misled,

14:02.513 --> 14:06.081
And we're being told
information which is false.

14:07.450 --> 14:10.819
I remember pitching
a story to 60 minutes,

14:10.820 --> 14:14.050
Which I had done one
for about a year prior,

14:14.056 --> 14:16.556
And it was about the border
and it was about migrants.

14:16.558 --> 14:18.718
Stories that rarely get
to see the light of day,

14:18.726 --> 14:20.026
And they told me,

14:20.027 --> 14:21.857
"john, we already did
a border story for you."

14:21.862 --> 14:25.962
It was a year ago, so there
must only be one border story.

14:25.965 --> 14:27.855
It's not what their
audience wants to see,

14:27.866 --> 14:28.896
So they're not interested.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.369
Even if it's newsworthy,

14:30.370 --> 14:32.668
They're going to consider
the ratings first.

14:45.315 --> 14:48.875
The heat index, a combination
of temperature and humidity,

14:48.885 --> 14:51.215
Is among the highest
in the nation.

14:52.687 --> 14:54.287
Pictures can't capture,

14:54.289 --> 14:56.589
And I can't adequately describe,

14:56.591 --> 14:59.326
How hot and how humid it feels.

15:04.797 --> 15:06.657
It's like walking through soup.

15:10.968 --> 15:13.298
Everywhere there are
signs of migrants.

15:15.772 --> 15:17.472
It's certainly a winter coat.

15:18.707 --> 15:20.407
Some young woman,

15:20.408 --> 15:23.838
Probably brought her best
clothes and best jewelry

15:23.844 --> 15:25.584
'cause she was here
to get a job.

15:33.219 --> 15:34.749
I think the last time I checked

15:34.753 --> 15:39.890
There are over 10,000 people
missing from records in Mexico,

15:39.891 --> 15:42.091
Just in Mexico,
not central America,

15:42.093 --> 15:43.562
Who have crossed that border.

15:43.563 --> 15:45.261
That means 10,000 families

15:45.262 --> 15:46.630
Who are still looking
for their loved ones

15:46.631 --> 15:48.330
Who may have crossed
that border illegally

15:48.331 --> 15:49.961
And were never heard from again.

15:49.965 --> 15:51.055
Where are they?

15:51.066 --> 15:52.466
There are no records of them.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.227
They're probably
in some cemetery plot

15:54.235 --> 15:56.195
Somewhere in Texas or Arizona.

15:56.203 --> 15:58.103
This is going on
all over the border.

16:06.478 --> 16:09.708
My colleagues, we have an
obligation to our citizens.

16:09.714 --> 16:12.248
We have an obligation
to this body

16:12.249 --> 16:16.079
To see that our resolutions
are complied with.

16:16.085 --> 16:18.285
We wrote 1441

16:18.287 --> 16:21.547
To give Iraq one last chance.

16:22.422 --> 16:24.090
Iraq is not, so far,

16:24.091 --> 16:28.126
Taking that one last chance.

16:28.127 --> 16:31.896
We must not shrink from
whatever is ahead of us

16:31.897 --> 16:36.127
And our responsibility to
the citizens of the countries

16:36.134 --> 16:39.169
That are represented
by this body.

16:39.170 --> 16:41.070
Thank you, Mr. President.

16:41.071 --> 16:44.840
Did Colin Powell close
the deal today in your mind?

16:44.841 --> 16:49.577
I think for anybody who
analyzes the situation,

16:49.578 --> 16:51.308
He has closed the deal.

16:51.313 --> 16:55.916
This irrefutable, undeniable,
incontrovertible evidence today.

16:55.917 --> 16:58.617
Colin Powell
brilliantly delivered

16:58.619 --> 16:59.849
That smoking gun today.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.222
It was so compelling,

17:01.223 --> 17:02.951
I don't see how
anybody at this point

17:02.956 --> 17:04.556
Can not support this effort.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.957
It was devastating,
I mean, and overwhelming.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.459
Overwhelming abundance
of the evidence.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.567
This was the mainstream
media's darkest hour.

17:18.569 --> 17:19.740
Go, go!

17:20.903 --> 17:22.103
Fight, fight!

17:22.105 --> 17:23.595
They were more
than cheerleaders,

17:23.606 --> 17:25.136
They were complicit.

17:25.140 --> 17:28.308
He just flooded the
terrain with... with data.

17:28.309 --> 17:30.939
The Powell speech has...
has moved the ball.

17:30.944 --> 17:33.144
I think the case is closed.

17:33.146 --> 17:35.206
You do not, under
international law,

17:35.214 --> 17:37.514
Wage a destructive sociocide.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.546
They basically blew
apart the country

17:39.551 --> 17:41.721
'cause they wanted
to get Saddam Hussein.

17:41.722 --> 17:45.749
Well, this is like one of the
greatest international crimes

17:45.755 --> 17:47.315
Since world war ii.

17:47.323 --> 17:50.291
This is ABC world news tonight.

17:50.292 --> 17:52.760
This is NBC nightly news.

17:54.195 --> 17:56.855
This is the CBS evening news.

17:56.864 --> 18:00.933
And it was committed with
the complete complicity

18:00.934 --> 18:04.336
Of the mainstream media
that kept critical voices,

18:04.337 --> 18:06.337
Such as ours, off the air.

18:06.339 --> 18:10.169
Oh, I think it's important
to have experts explain the war

18:10.176 --> 18:12.606
And to describe
the military hardware,

18:12.611 --> 18:13.680
Describe the tactics.

18:13.681 --> 18:15.778
Talk about the strategy
behind the conflict.

18:15.780 --> 18:18.049
I went to the pentagon
myself several times

18:18.050 --> 18:19.278
Before the war started

18:19.282 --> 18:20.482
And met with
important people there

18:20.483 --> 18:22.321
And said, for instance, at CNN,

18:22.322 --> 18:25.048
"here are the generals
we're thinking of retaining

18:25.054 --> 18:27.724
To advise us on the air
and off about the war,"

18:27.725 --> 18:29.792
And we got a big
thumbs up on all of them.

18:29.793 --> 18:30.821
That was important.

18:31.991 --> 18:33.691
Journalists, too many of them,

18:33.693 --> 18:35.393
And some quite explicitly,

18:35.394 --> 18:38.929
Have said that
they see their mission

18:38.930 --> 18:40.997
As helping the war effort.

18:40.998 --> 18:44.667
At MSNBC, I was on the air daily

18:44.668 --> 18:47.268
As a political
and media analyst.

18:47.270 --> 18:49.239
And if you define
your mission that way,

18:49.240 --> 18:50.998
You'll end up suppressing news

18:51.006 --> 18:52.566
That might be
important, accurate,

18:52.574 --> 18:54.774
But maybe isn't helpful
to the war effort.

18:54.776 --> 18:58.236
But I lost my time
because they had to make room

18:58.246 --> 19:01.106
As we got closer to
the invasion of Iraq

19:01.115 --> 19:04.775
For this endless parade
of retired generals,

19:04.785 --> 19:08.885
Majors, admirals,
former CIA chiefs,

19:08.888 --> 19:13.357
And we know now those people
had no independence,

19:13.358 --> 19:16.458
They were being fed talking
points by the pentagon,

19:16.461 --> 19:19.830
And most of what they said, as
our country was driven to war,

19:19.831 --> 19:20.997
Was false.

19:28.238 --> 19:29.868
Wealthy insurance.

19:33.742 --> 19:36.710
From Pacifica,
this is democracy now!

19:38.312 --> 19:40.512
Democracy now!,
it's slightly larger, I think,

19:40.514 --> 19:43.214
Than the space
I.F. Stone operated out of,

19:43.216 --> 19:45.546
But very much modeled
on this idea

19:45.551 --> 19:48.651
Of the media being
a sanctuary of dissent.

19:48.654 --> 19:51.592
You know, necessity is
the mother of invention.

19:51.593 --> 19:53.090
We couldn't afford
the satellites

19:53.091 --> 19:54.591
That the networks had.

19:54.592 --> 19:57.092
We worked with the internet
from the beginning

19:57.094 --> 19:58.394
Out of necessity.

19:58.395 --> 20:03.195
Now, we're broadcasting
on over 1300 radio

20:03.199 --> 20:04.769
And television stations.

20:04.770 --> 20:07.667
Public access TV,
community radio,

20:07.669 --> 20:10.699
Public radio, PBS,
public television,

20:10.705 --> 20:13.805
But we're not there to
win a popularity contest.

20:13.808 --> 20:16.678
We're there to bring out
the voices of people

20:16.679 --> 20:17.907
All over the world.

20:36.662 --> 20:40.798
From Pacifica radio,
this is democracy now!

20:40.799 --> 20:45.369
Pope john Paul it's senior
advisor has arrived in Baghdad

20:45.370 --> 20:47.439
For meetings with
senior Iraqi leaders.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.398
Last night,
he presided over a mass

20:49.406 --> 20:51.836
At st. Joseph's church
in central Baghdad.

20:51.841 --> 20:55.581
Democracy now! Correspondent
Jeremy Scahill was there.

20:59.113 --> 21:00.583
Regardless of their faith,

21:00.584 --> 21:03.181
Iraqis are praying
for a miracle.

21:03.183 --> 21:06.153
Almost no one believes
that war can be averted.

21:06.154 --> 21:09.392
John Paul ii has added his
voice to the growing chorus

21:09.393 --> 21:10.988
Against a war on Iraq,

21:10.989 --> 21:14.289
But it's unlikely that
George W. Bush will listen.

21:14.292 --> 21:15.961
His own Methodist church
has come out

21:15.962 --> 21:17.629
Against an attack on Iraq,

21:17.630 --> 21:20.228
And bush won't even
meet with its leaders.

21:20.230 --> 21:24.000
For democracy now!, this is
Jeremy Scahill in Baghdad.

21:34.976 --> 21:38.436
The problem is most of the
big media are businesses.

21:38.446 --> 21:41.306
They respond to their investors,

21:41.315 --> 21:43.075
The stock market
and their advertisers,

21:43.083 --> 21:46.752
And independent journalists
bring their conscience to work

21:46.753 --> 21:49.993
And they call the situation
as it really is factually,

21:49.994 --> 21:51.619
So they're a rare breed.

21:51.623 --> 21:54.623
They're not indentured
to commercial motivation.

21:54.626 --> 21:58.186
Well, the problem is
is the illusion of free press.

21:58.196 --> 22:01.426
You know, we don't have state
media in the United States,

22:01.432 --> 22:04.702
But if we had it,
how would it be any different?

22:05.701 --> 22:07.501
It's easy to criticize fox.

22:07.503 --> 22:10.503
It's fox, it's CNN,
it's the new york times.

22:10.506 --> 22:12.636
That's why we need
independent journalism.

22:12.641 --> 22:14.871
You know, that's
why we need a media

22:14.876 --> 22:16.936
That challenges
the corporate power.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.813
When we cover war,
we can't be brought to you

22:18.814 --> 22:20.712
By the weapons manufacturers.

22:20.713 --> 22:22.753
When we cover climate change,
we can't be brought to you

22:22.754 --> 22:24.748
By the oil, gas,
coal, nuclear companies.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.580
When we cover healthcare,
we can't be brought to you

22:26.585 --> 22:28.445
By the insurance and
the drug companies.

22:28.453 --> 22:30.853
We have to have a media

22:30.855 --> 22:33.955
That is a counterbalance
to those in power.

22:33.958 --> 22:36.888
It's the only equalizing force.

22:41.497 --> 22:43.227
I think the media
is really nihilistic.

22:43.233 --> 22:44.933
It's... it's about
making money.

22:46.367 --> 22:48.527
What makes money
in this country happens to be

22:48.536 --> 22:51.266
Avoiding difficult truths
about our society.

22:51.272 --> 22:54.710
You know, a story about what
it's like to be on welfare,

22:54.711 --> 22:56.168
That's not a story, right?

22:56.176 --> 22:59.106
But you know, Kim Kardashian
falls into a puddle

22:59.112 --> 23:00.642
In central park, that's a story.

23:00.646 --> 23:03.206
Well, Kim and Kanye,
also known as Kimye,

23:03.215 --> 23:07.315
Are expected to get married
here in Florence this weekend

23:07.318 --> 23:08.848
In a Medici fortress

23:08.852 --> 23:12.621
That cost $400,000 to rent out.

23:12.622 --> 23:15.662
Erin McLaughlin,
CNN, Florence, Italy.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.570
If you had to come
up with a slogan

23:33.575 --> 23:35.205
For what our new
media venture is,

23:35.209 --> 23:37.779
The one that Jeremy Scahill
and Laura Poitras and I are...

23:37.780 --> 23:40.808
Are building under the
aegis of first look media,

23:40.814 --> 23:43.714
You probably could
use as a slogan,

23:43.716 --> 23:45.216
"the spirit of I.F. Stone,

23:45.217 --> 23:46.977
But funded with
$250 million."

23:46.985 --> 23:49.385
Glenn Greenwald has been
a lightning rod for controversy

23:49.387 --> 23:52.717
Since he obtained those secret
NSA documents from Ed Snowden

23:52.723 --> 23:54.393
And published some
of them in the guardian.

23:54.394 --> 23:55.961
Now he's launching
a media company

23:55.962 --> 24:00.189
Backed by wealthy ebay founder,
Pierre Omidyar.

24:00.196 --> 24:03.256
The main thing is you got
to encapsulate all of this

24:03.265 --> 24:06.595
In a way that it
can't be decrypted

24:06.601 --> 24:09.701
And read when it's in
transit across the network,

24:09.704 --> 24:12.204
Or on either of the end points.

24:12.206 --> 24:13.866
Okay, I mean, just so you know,

24:13.874 --> 24:16.374
These documents are basically
all gonna be up-linked within,

24:16.376 --> 24:17.876
Like, 48 hours, 72 hours.

24:17.877 --> 24:19.707
This is... this is
simply, you know,

24:19.712 --> 24:21.752
You want to get in the process
of doing this for everything

24:21.753 --> 24:23.507
Because it seems hard,
but it's not hard.

24:23.515 --> 24:24.705
This is super easy.

24:29.253 --> 24:31.053
Thank you so much
to the academy.

24:31.054 --> 24:34.556
The disclosures that
Edward Snowden reveals

24:34.557 --> 24:37.617
Don't only expose
a threat to our privacy,

24:37.626 --> 24:39.586
But to our democracy itself,

24:39.594 --> 24:41.663
And I share this
with Glenn Greenwald

24:41.664 --> 24:44.532
And other journalists
who are exposing truth.

24:44.533 --> 24:45.761
Thank you.

24:53.538 --> 24:55.168
Was Mr. Daoud
killed immediately

24:55.172 --> 24:57.642
Or did he live for
a while after he was shot?

25:11.152 --> 25:15.222
You saw the us forces take
the bullets out of the body?

25:18.092 --> 25:21.760
When Glenn Greenwald and
Jeremy Scahill teamed up

25:21.761 --> 25:24.161
Together at the intercept,

25:24.163 --> 25:25.463
It was like a...

25:25.464 --> 25:27.364
A dream for
adversarial journalists.

25:28.999 --> 25:32.968
And since 2014, they've
been able, with their team,

25:32.969 --> 25:36.469
To break story after story
of political corruption,

25:36.472 --> 25:39.106
Especially scoop after scoop

25:39.107 --> 25:42.207
About the national security
surveillance state,

25:42.210 --> 25:45.410
Which mainstream journalists
often tend to avoid

25:45.413 --> 25:48.681
Out of a false notion
of patriotism.

25:48.682 --> 25:52.517
Good journalism today has
the state in its cross-hairs,

25:52.518 --> 25:54.748
And you never want
to punch down.

25:54.753 --> 25:56.323
You always want to punch up.

25:56.324 --> 25:58.062
That's what I think
we're trying to do

25:58.063 --> 25:59.317
At the intercept.

26:00.624 --> 26:02.124
And then once
you have that file,

26:02.126 --> 26:03.986
Just right click the file
in the finder.

26:03.994 --> 26:05.764
Were they... were they able
to decrypt it at all?

26:05.765 --> 26:06.862
I don't think so.

26:06.863 --> 26:08.132
Well, you look behind me

26:08.133 --> 26:10.060
And you see a news room
full of fantastic,

26:10.065 --> 26:13.025
Independent reporters who come
from all sorts of backgrounds,

26:13.034 --> 26:15.872
But this is still very much
a... a project in development.

26:15.873 --> 26:17.670
I would say our mission
statement is...

26:17.671 --> 26:19.771
Is to produce adversarial,
fearless journalism.

26:19.773 --> 26:22.643
This central idea that,
I think, everyone shares

26:22.644 --> 26:25.080
Is that the more
power someone wields,

26:25.081 --> 26:27.137
The more journalistic
accountability

26:27.145 --> 26:28.735
And scrutiny they need.

26:36.519 --> 26:39.088
I mean, it says explicitly
there that they're...

26:39.089 --> 26:41.919
That it's supporting drone
surveillance operations.

26:43.291 --> 26:46.127
Most of the bandwidth
is on galaxy 26,

26:46.128 --> 26:48.628
And not an NRO secret site.

26:48.630 --> 26:50.260
That must be the satellite.

26:50.264 --> 26:54.133
Yeah, it can support up to
40 UAV sorties simultaneously.

26:54.134 --> 26:57.202
And these are satellites
showing construction

26:57.203 --> 26:58.836
Of a facility in Germany

26:58.837 --> 27:01.297
That the us uses as part
of its drone program.

27:01.306 --> 27:04.536
The German government
basically is trying to argue

27:04.542 --> 27:05.742
That it doesn't have any...

27:05.743 --> 27:06.909
Any role at all

27:06.910 --> 27:08.840
In the targeted killing program,

27:08.845 --> 27:11.575
'cause that would be
illegal under German law.

27:11.581 --> 27:14.749
It's a story that
involves many countries

27:14.750 --> 27:18.080
Being involved with
the us drone program

27:18.086 --> 27:21.716
And their governments either
are not aware of it, or...

27:21.722 --> 27:23.422
Or they're lying,

27:23.423 --> 27:26.193
And that's part of what
we're trying to nail down.

27:26.194 --> 27:28.930
Part of my discussion that
was shown in citizen-four

27:28.931 --> 27:30.858
With Snowden had some reference

27:30.863 --> 27:32.063
To the use of Ramstein

27:32.064 --> 27:33.902
As part of a chain of command

27:33.903 --> 27:36.399
In which these drone
executions are carried out.

27:38.803 --> 27:40.043
You know that?

27:41.237 --> 27:44.807
But the drone papers
really solidified this...

27:44.808 --> 27:47.308
This role in a way
that is really important

27:47.310 --> 27:48.840
And it created,
actually, some debate

27:48.844 --> 27:50.413
And some scandal in Germany.

27:50.414 --> 27:54.381
The German population was almost
entirely unaware of the role

27:54.382 --> 27:57.782
That Ramstein is playing in
this program, and obviously,

27:57.785 --> 27:59.845
Germans overwhelmingly
oppose the death penalty

27:59.853 --> 28:02.591
And so it stands to reason
that if they had known about it,

28:02.592 --> 28:04.789
They never would
have allowed it.

28:04.791 --> 28:06.421
This is the most sophisticated

28:06.425 --> 28:09.385
So-called clean way
of bumping people off.

28:11.629 --> 28:14.399
I became sort of obsessed
with this notion that a man

28:14.400 --> 28:17.228
Who is a constitutional lawyer
by training,

28:17.234 --> 28:21.670
Who won the Nobel peace prize,
is presiding over a...

28:21.671 --> 28:24.706
An attempt to legitimize

28:24.707 --> 28:27.537
And some would say,
legalize assassination

28:27.543 --> 28:31.643
As a central component
of us policy.

28:31.646 --> 28:35.376
I'll make our government
open and transparent,

28:35.382 --> 28:36.882
So that anyone can ensure

28:36.883 --> 28:40.118
That our business is
the people's business.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.988
Just as Louis Brandeis
once said,

28:41.989 --> 28:44.447
"sunlight is the
greatest disinfectant."

28:44.456 --> 28:46.556
Who would have thought
that we'd get a president

28:46.558 --> 28:48.758
Who is a charismatic, perhaps...

28:48.760 --> 28:50.230
Probably one of the
smartest presidents,

28:50.231 --> 28:53.358
If not the smartest
president in us history,

28:53.364 --> 28:55.664
With a great background
in social justice causes

28:55.666 --> 28:59.566
Who would preside over more
prosecutions of whistle blowers

28:59.569 --> 29:03.238
As spies than all previous
administrations combined,

29:03.239 --> 29:06.169
Who would expand
the drone program

29:06.175 --> 29:09.535
And try to legitimize
the assassination program?

29:09.545 --> 29:10.775
When Obama was elected,

29:10.779 --> 29:12.149
He pledged that
his administration

29:12.150 --> 29:14.277
Was going to be the most
transparent in history.

29:14.282 --> 29:15.649
No more secrecy.

29:15.650 --> 29:17.620
That's the commitment
I make to you as president.

29:23.521 --> 29:25.256
No more secrecy.

29:25.257 --> 29:27.817
You know, we'll
work with sources

29:27.826 --> 29:30.056
Or with documents
that we've obtained,

29:30.061 --> 29:32.561
And then you, you know,
you try to hunt down

29:32.563 --> 29:34.863
The publicly available
record on these things

29:34.865 --> 29:36.325
And I mean, an incredible
amount of stuff

29:36.333 --> 29:38.073
Is sort of hidden in plain sight

29:38.074 --> 29:40.128
If you dig far enough.

29:40.136 --> 29:41.896
That's all of what
I.F. Stone was doing.

29:41.904 --> 29:44.204
I guess what's different
is that, you know,

29:44.206 --> 29:46.936
Part of what we do is
try to cultivate sources

29:46.942 --> 29:48.842
And talk to people who
are directly knowledgeable

29:48.843 --> 29:52.043
About various operations
in the military

29:52.046 --> 29:55.346
Or the CIA or the NSA
and then, you know,

29:55.349 --> 29:58.749
Then you start going
down a rabbit hole.

29:59.917 --> 30:01.447
I mean, I've often
said that I thought

30:01.452 --> 30:04.187
That I.F. Stone
is the first blogger,

30:04.188 --> 30:08.888
Even though he existed
before bloggers existed,

30:08.891 --> 30:11.191
But in my view,
he really encapsulated

30:11.193 --> 30:13.263
What became the new media ethos,

30:13.264 --> 30:18.061
Which is the idea of working
as independently as possible

30:18.065 --> 30:21.795
From all of the power
factions and centers

30:21.801 --> 30:23.568
On which you're reporting,

30:23.569 --> 30:27.169
And what we've built here, in
terms of our new media outlet,

30:27.172 --> 30:32.309
Is very much, I think, based
on the ethos that he pioneered.

30:35.179 --> 30:38.347
Ooh, do you feel the
breeze from the subway?

30:38.348 --> 30:39.978
Isn't it delicious?

30:59.467 --> 31:01.167
I got to meet I.F. Stone

31:01.168 --> 31:04.236
In the mid '80s
in Washington, do.

31:04.237 --> 31:07.297
I wanted to put out my
own weekly moore's weekly,

31:07.306 --> 31:10.836
And I just wanted to go
and talk to him about it.

31:10.842 --> 31:13.142
It was just an amazing afternoon

31:13.144 --> 31:15.344
That I got to have with him

31:15.346 --> 31:17.776
To really, kind of,
pick his brain

31:17.781 --> 31:20.011
And tell him, you know,
what I wanted to do

31:20.016 --> 31:21.676
And he gave me,
you know, good advice.

31:21.684 --> 31:24.894
Advice I kind of already knew,
because I'd read him, you know.

31:24.895 --> 31:26.417
His... his great motto

31:26.421 --> 31:28.351
Of all governments
are run by liars

31:28.356 --> 31:30.086
And nothing they say
should be believed,

31:30.091 --> 31:31.791
And he said...
he said to me,

31:31.792 --> 31:33.261
But I would expand that now

31:33.262 --> 31:35.229
To governments, corporations,

31:35.230 --> 31:37.288
You know, it's not just
the... the government.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.896
It's this... that...
anybody in power.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.428
You must start, as a journalist,

31:41.432 --> 31:43.932
With the assumption that
they are lying to you.

31:43.934 --> 31:46.103
Now, some of them
may not be lying,

31:46.104 --> 31:47.802
But it's their duty
to prove to you,

31:47.803 --> 31:49.473
The journalist,
that they're not lying.

31:51.004 --> 31:53.811
Through high school,
I read I.F. Stone's weekly.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.337
One of the things
I learned was that

31:55.341 --> 31:58.541
Humor isn't just
about telling jokes

31:58.544 --> 32:00.411
Or just about funny ha-ha.

32:00.412 --> 32:05.212
Humor can be the most piercing
of political weapons.

32:05.216 --> 32:08.646
I'm... I'm stunned that more
people actually don't use humor

32:08.652 --> 32:10.719
Because it's so powerful,

32:10.720 --> 32:13.850
And one of the great things
that you learn about humor

32:13.856 --> 32:16.486
And good ridicule
when in politics

32:16.491 --> 32:19.591
Is that it's very hard
to respond to it.

32:19.594 --> 32:21.231
The FAA has taken the action

32:21.232 --> 32:24.498
To close all of the airports
in the United States.

32:24.499 --> 32:26.957
Thousands of travelers
were stranded.

32:26.966 --> 32:28.496
Among them, Ricky martin,

32:28.500 --> 32:31.100
Due to appear at tonight's
Latin Grammy awards.

32:31.102 --> 32:33.837
Not even Ricky martin could fly.

32:33.838 --> 32:36.768
But really, who wanted to fly?

32:36.774 --> 32:38.040
No one.

32:38.041 --> 32:40.509
Except the Bin Ladens.

32:40.510 --> 32:44.140
♪ We got to get
out of this place ♪

32:44.146 --> 32:47.876
♪ If it's the last
thing we ever do ♪

32:47.883 --> 32:50.152
That whole idea of
how I found that thing

32:50.153 --> 32:51.881
On the FBI and the
bush administration

32:51.886 --> 32:54.916
Allowing the bin Ladens to
fly out the day after 9/11,

32:54.922 --> 32:57.060
That is directly
from I.F. Stone.

32:57.061 --> 32:58.587
He said to me, he said,

32:58.591 --> 33:01.291
"when you pick up the paper,
you go to page 17 first."

33:01.293 --> 33:02.563
Don't read the front page.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.960
Skip the front page,
go to page 17.

33:05.963 --> 33:07.732
'Cause that's where
the truth is.

33:07.733 --> 33:09.200
And it's gonna be really small.

33:09.201 --> 33:11.899
It might be in a little
two paragraph story,

33:11.901 --> 33:14.669
Or it'll be buried
in paragraph 78,

33:14.670 --> 33:16.270
But that's where
they're putting it,

33:16.271 --> 33:17.571
And they know
what they're doing.

33:17.572 --> 33:18.842
"So, you just
go right there."

33:18.843 --> 33:19.969
Yeah.

33:36.721 --> 33:39.290
What I saw and learned

33:39.291 --> 33:43.026
From reading
I.F. Stone's weekly

33:43.027 --> 33:46.557
Was about an agenda

33:46.563 --> 33:48.563
That was not determined

33:48.565 --> 33:51.325
By conventional wisdom.

33:51.334 --> 33:55.804
To me, that's the real
enemy of great reporting

33:55.805 --> 33:57.195
Is conventional wisdom.

33:57.206 --> 33:59.166
- Mrs. Hamblin?
- Yes.

33:59.174 --> 34:01.742
Hi, we're from
the Washington post.

34:01.743 --> 34:03.812
I'm Carl Bernstein,
this is bob Woodward.

34:03.813 --> 34:06.311
A friend of the committee said
that we could contact you.

34:06.313 --> 34:10.248
I brought no
ideological baggage.

34:10.250 --> 34:13.418
Whatever my background
was to Watergate,

34:13.418 --> 34:16.888
I brought
a reportorial sense to it,

34:16.889 --> 34:18.589
Partly because I thought,

34:18.590 --> 34:20.389
"how could the president
of the united sates

34:20.391 --> 34:22.121
Be involved in
something this dumb?"

34:22.126 --> 34:23.626
At the beginning.

34:23.627 --> 34:26.286
Conventional wisdom is
the enemy of good reporting

34:26.295 --> 34:28.156
And I think Izzy
understood that.

34:28.164 --> 34:30.998
I understood that
from the get-go.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.600
Can I help you in some way?

34:32.601 --> 34:34.331
Yeah, I'm Carl Bernstein,
I've been waiting here

34:34.335 --> 34:35.636
- Since nine in the morning.
- Would you wait outside?

34:35.637 --> 34:36.996
I've been waiting
out since this morning.

34:37.005 --> 34:38.195
Go ahead and finish your call.

34:38.206 --> 34:39.136
Wait outside, please, will you?

34:39.139 --> 34:40.570
No, no, no, no, no.

34:40.574 --> 34:42.074
I'm the reporter from
the Washington post.

34:42.074 --> 34:43.665
We talked on the
telephone yesterday,

34:43.676 --> 34:45.306
And you told me to come
on down here and I'm here.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.440
Okay, yeah,
I got the press here.

34:47.445 --> 34:50.505
Watergate is an unusual
instance, and I mean,

34:50.514 --> 34:52.813
At first people didn't believe
the stories we were writing,

34:52.815 --> 34:55.516
Including most of our colleagues
in the press in Washington.

34:55.518 --> 34:58.248
Watergate is an unusual instance

34:58.254 --> 35:00.392
In which the right
things happened.

35:00.393 --> 35:02.119
Bernstein got another source.

35:02.124 --> 35:03.524
The guy at justice confirmed.

35:04.691 --> 35:06.691
If there's any doubt,
we can run it tomorrow.

35:06.694 --> 35:08.632
You don't have to, the story's
solid, we're sure of it.

35:08.633 --> 35:10.393
I just got off the phone
with him, it's gold.

35:12.898 --> 35:14.528
Okay, we go with it.

35:43.192 --> 35:44.662
Normally, when I get in,

35:44.663 --> 35:47.499
Which is around this
time, 1:00, 2:00, 2:30 P.M.,

35:47.500 --> 35:49.497
I see what else
the morning producer,

35:49.499 --> 35:51.329
'cause the morning
producer leaves,

35:51.334 --> 35:53.734
Like, early afternoon
around 3:00,

35:53.736 --> 35:56.436
But he's normally, you know,

35:56.438 --> 35:59.468
Checked out a few
possible stories,

35:59.474 --> 36:01.643
So depending on what he suggests

36:01.644 --> 36:03.942
And he's often been in
conversation with Amy,

36:03.944 --> 36:06.244
I immediately start
reaching out to people

36:06.246 --> 36:09.376
To guess potential guests.

36:09.382 --> 36:11.082
Yeah, I think that
should be fine.

36:11.083 --> 36:15.986
We'll just make sure to
start with another segment

36:15.987 --> 36:17.717
And then, you could be on,

36:17.722 --> 36:20.622
Like, at 8:00, at 8:30.

36:24.460 --> 36:27.760
Amira Hass is here,
and she leaves Saturday,

36:27.764 --> 36:31.034
So I think we should definitely
have her in the studio tomorrow.

36:31.035 --> 36:32.500
Sharif is here.

36:32.501 --> 36:35.031
- And he has this investigation.
- On Yemen, yeah.

36:35.036 --> 36:38.236
And then, anything else that
happens in the world today.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.169
Okay, now going to
pitch on the stations

36:40.174 --> 36:41.474
To make sure they're around

36:41.475 --> 36:43.435
So that we can
continue to broadcast.

36:43.443 --> 36:45.343
Okay, that's great,
Amy, thank you.

36:55.953 --> 36:57.653
So your son served in Iraq?

36:57.655 --> 37:02.015
Yeah, he survived
like three ambushes,

37:02.025 --> 37:03.355
But he came out screwed up.

37:03.359 --> 37:07.229
He's, you know,
the PTSD, you know.

37:10.898 --> 37:12.398
Here.

37:14.267 --> 37:16.567
Well, handsome man.

37:16.570 --> 37:18.100
Yeah.

37:18.104 --> 37:21.106
How many life
has to be destroyed?

37:21.107 --> 37:22.467
How many family?

37:26.377 --> 37:28.607
Stupid wars,
you know, it's like...

37:29.746 --> 37:32.706
But you feel kinda,
you know, in danger.

37:32.716 --> 37:34.976
Have you been threatened before?

37:34.984 --> 37:39.487
There's dangers, yeah,
of working there now.

37:39.488 --> 37:41.488
But the risks we take

37:41.490 --> 37:43.920
Are much less than what
other people are doing,

37:43.925 --> 37:46.225
So especially people
who work in human rights.

37:46.227 --> 37:50.127
They have much bigger risks and
so, compared to them, you know,

37:50.130 --> 37:52.800
You get courage when you...
when you see them work.

37:52.801 --> 37:55.199
You know, they say, you know,

37:55.201 --> 37:56.801
We're engaged in
a war on terror,

37:56.802 --> 37:58.872
And they use the same
language as they use here,

37:58.873 --> 38:00.400
"war on terror."

38:00.404 --> 38:03.142
But the policies just
result in more terror,

38:03.143 --> 38:05.140
So we have more terrorism now,

38:05.142 --> 38:06.442
And more war.

38:10.378 --> 38:12.008
I started working in journalism

38:12.013 --> 38:16.583
Right around the beginning
of the Iraq war in 2003.

38:18.585 --> 38:20.545
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

38:22.289 --> 38:25.758
It was very frustrating
as a young person

38:25.759 --> 38:28.359
Living here in
new york, as an Arab,

38:28.361 --> 38:30.961
As someone who was
newly politicized

38:30.963 --> 38:34.832
And watching this massive
invasion being drummed up.

38:34.833 --> 38:37.733
One felt like you had to scream
and say, "this is wrong."

38:37.735 --> 38:39.765
And there were these
kinds of protests

38:39.770 --> 38:42.670
And it was when I first
heard democracy now!

38:42.672 --> 38:45.440
And I first heard
these kinds of voices

38:45.441 --> 38:48.441
That I hadn't heard
at all on other airwaves.

38:48.444 --> 38:51.244
Voices of dissent,
voices of opposition.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.676
People who were
not allowed on the air.

38:54.682 --> 38:57.520
I was very much drawn
to this kind of journalism.

38:57.521 --> 38:59.048
My first day at democracy now!

38:59.052 --> 39:02.290
Is the first day of the
Iraq war, March 19th, 2003.

39:02.291 --> 39:05.118
Reporter Nicholas Kulish
who broke this story.

39:05.124 --> 39:07.692
All that and more, coming up.

39:07.693 --> 39:10.493
Amy Goodman has nurtured
a number of journalists,

39:10.495 --> 39:12.755
Including Sharif Abdel Kouddous.

39:12.763 --> 39:15.763
He was a correspondent,
a senior producer,

39:15.766 --> 39:17.926
He was occasionally a co-host,

39:17.934 --> 39:21.503
And then 2011,
the uprising begins in Egypt,

39:21.504 --> 39:23.944
The country that
Sharif was born in,

39:23.945 --> 39:26.969
And he flies to Egypt

39:26.975 --> 39:29.975
And country is almost
unrecognizable to him.

39:29.978 --> 39:33.008
That the fear was gone
and his vivid reporting

39:33.014 --> 39:36.649
Had millions of people
following his reporting.

39:36.650 --> 39:38.880
It's just after 10:00 A.M.
On Tuesday morning.

39:38.885 --> 39:41.345
Today marks the
one week anniversary

39:41.354 --> 39:44.656
Of the popular uprising
that began January 25th.

39:44.657 --> 39:47.957
There's more people here than
I have ever seen in Tahrir,

39:47.960 --> 39:49.490
Yet in this revolt.

39:49.494 --> 39:50.831
Today's the day that they say

39:50.832 --> 39:52.558
They're going
to get Mubarak out.

39:58.967 --> 40:00.827
For more, we're joined
by Sharif Abdel Kouddous

40:00.836 --> 40:02.666
Who's just returned from Yemen.

40:02.671 --> 40:04.371
He's a democracy now!
Correspondent,

40:04.372 --> 40:05.972
A fellow at the
nation institute,

40:05.973 --> 40:09.913
And he's recently written a
piece for the global post called

40:09.914 --> 40:13.879
"with us help, Saudi Arabia
is obliterating Yemen."

40:13.880 --> 40:16.710
It's the first
of a two part series on Yemen.

40:16.716 --> 40:19.046
Sharif, start off
by just explaining

40:19.051 --> 40:22.151
What you found in your
weeks-long trip there.

40:22.154 --> 40:23.491
Well, I spent most of the time

40:23.492 --> 40:25.288
In the outhits controlled
north of Yemen

40:25.289 --> 40:26.549
And this is an area

40:26.556 --> 40:28.286
That's been pounded relentlessly

40:28.291 --> 40:32.527
For the past nine months
with near daily air strikes.

40:32.528 --> 40:34.688
You can't visit a city
or a town in Yemen

40:34.696 --> 40:37.796
Without seeing
the destruction on the ground.

40:37.799 --> 40:40.429
Everything has
been hit from homes

40:40.434 --> 40:43.034
To schools, restaurants,
bridges, roads,

40:43.036 --> 40:46.096
A lot of civilian
infrastructure and...

40:46.105 --> 40:48.735
And with that, of course,
comes a lot of the suffering.

40:53.077 --> 40:56.507
The Saudi bombing campaign
is backed by the United States

40:56.513 --> 40:58.551
With logistics and
intelligence support,

40:58.552 --> 41:02.017
And I think that's a fact that
many Americans don't realize

41:02.018 --> 41:05.318
That they're complicit
with their tax dollars

41:05.321 --> 41:07.821
In this conflict
that has civilians

41:07.823 --> 41:10.357
At the epicenter
of its suffering.

41:10.358 --> 41:12.088
Be very careful back there.

41:12.093 --> 41:13.163
I will.

41:20.599 --> 41:22.899
These are mass graves
they're combing all day.

41:22.901 --> 41:24.101
Every one is different.

41:24.102 --> 41:26.672
Would you want your
son buried that way?

41:26.673 --> 41:29.241
Or your mom or your
sister or your brother?

41:29.242 --> 41:32.640
I mean, this isn't how you want
someone you love to be buried.

41:47.189 --> 41:48.856
So good to see you.

41:48.857 --> 41:50.717
You too, sorry, I'm standing
in the door to keep it open.

41:50.725 --> 41:52.055
Ah, how are you guys?

41:52.059 --> 41:53.589
I'm great, thank you.

41:53.593 --> 41:56.263
Good, well, we could do
the elevator or the stairs.

41:56.264 --> 41:57.362
How many flights up?

42:00.733 --> 42:03.733
Hey, Audrey, do
you remember john?

42:03.736 --> 42:05.866
Audrey, john, nice to meet you.

42:05.871 --> 42:07.401
Thank you so much
for doing the work.

42:18.882 --> 42:21.082
Okay, john, so this is what

42:21.084 --> 42:24.186
We end up with oftentimes.

42:24.187 --> 42:26.817
So, you can see
these are really white

42:26.822 --> 42:28.762
Because they're sun bleached.

42:28.763 --> 42:33.427
So, this person was out
for a long period of time,

42:33.428 --> 42:38.497
And they also sustained quite
a bit of carnivore damage,

42:38.498 --> 42:40.728
But you can see
this is an individual

42:40.733 --> 42:45.236
Who has 206 bones at
a minimum in their body,

42:45.237 --> 42:46.867
And we have three.

42:46.871 --> 42:49.441
And there's no way you will
ever identify this person.

42:49.442 --> 42:51.509
Well, we have taken a DNA sample

42:51.510 --> 42:53.538
And this was actually analyzed

42:53.543 --> 42:55.512
At the central
identification lab

42:55.513 --> 42:57.111
Through the joint armed forces.

42:57.112 --> 43:01.181
It could be if we can match
this DNA sample to a family.

43:10.824 --> 43:15.527
I have no doubt that if
200 poodles were mis-buried,

43:15.528 --> 43:16.928
Everybody would be up in arms.

43:16.929 --> 43:19.599
We'd probably change
some sort of poodle law

43:19.600 --> 43:21.758
To make sure that these
were buried properly.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.096
The fact that these
were 200 human migrants,

43:24.101 --> 43:26.601
Mostly Latin American,

43:26.604 --> 43:28.774
Is the reason that
nothing has been done.

43:31.241 --> 43:33.410
It's the sole reason
that nothing has been done.

43:33.411 --> 43:35.009
These people don't count.

43:35.010 --> 43:36.910
For the most part, they're
considered to be criminal.

43:36.911 --> 43:38.311
They're here to rob your jobs,

43:38.312 --> 43:40.250
They're here to
ruin our economy.

43:40.251 --> 43:42.977
Donald trump would like to build
a wall to separate us from them.

43:42.983 --> 43:45.483
They're marginalized
and they're vilified,

43:45.485 --> 43:50.145
So if they die and are thrown
into a hole in the ground,

43:50.155 --> 43:51.385
Good riddance.

43:52.355 --> 43:53.785
Para ti.

43:55.391 --> 43:56.557
¿Como Te llamas?

43:56.558 --> 43:57.788
- Carlos.
- Carlos.

43:57.792 --> 43:59.359
Soy Reportero.

44:20.880 --> 44:25.016
My father really believed in
the importance of a free press.

44:25.017 --> 44:29.017
He once told me, "if something
goes wrong with the government",

44:29.020 --> 44:31.650
A free press will ferret it out,

44:31.655 --> 44:33.115
And it will get fixed.

44:33.123 --> 44:35.192
But if something goes
wrong with the free press,

44:35.193 --> 44:37.391
"The country will go
straight to hell."

44:37.393 --> 44:39.727
This is the typewriter on which

44:39.728 --> 44:43.128
My father typed
with two fingers.

44:43.131 --> 44:45.031
So, how long was he
using this typewriter?

44:45.032 --> 44:47.266
Well, as long as I
can remember, really.

44:47.267 --> 44:49.397
It's a... it's amazing that he
would type with two fingers.

44:49.402 --> 44:51.740
So, he never... he never
learned how to type with...

44:51.741 --> 44:53.337
He wasn't very mechanical.

44:53.338 --> 44:56.738
In fact, our cars
kept breaking down

44:56.741 --> 44:58.771
Because he never
changed the oil.

45:12.121 --> 45:16.290
I.F. Stone was both
an investigator and a writer

45:16.291 --> 45:20.527
With sarcasm and wit
and humor in his work,

45:20.528 --> 45:22.228
And today's I.F. Stones,

45:22.229 --> 45:25.129
A lot of them don't come
to that level of writing,

45:25.131 --> 45:29.000
Except when you think
of Matt Taibbi.

45:29.001 --> 45:31.231
The media has spent
decades turning the news

45:31.236 --> 45:32.366
Into a consumer business

45:32.370 --> 45:34.000
That's basically
indistinguishable

45:34.004 --> 45:36.144
From selling cheeseburgers
or video games.

45:36.905 --> 45:38.005
You want bigger margins,

45:38.007 --> 45:39.267
You just cram the product full

45:39.274 --> 45:41.412
Of more fat and
sugar and violence

45:41.413 --> 45:44.009
And you wait for your obese,
over-stimulated consumer

45:44.011 --> 45:45.678
To come waddling forth.

45:48.348 --> 45:51.018
Breaking news right now,
just coming into the ABC...

45:51.019 --> 45:53.417
The death toll has
risen even higher today.

45:53.419 --> 45:55.989
We start with celebrities
behaving badly.

45:55.990 --> 45:58.188
Squealing, like, panda
lovers all over the planet

45:58.190 --> 46:01.820
Riveted as this mama bear
delivers a cub, and then...

46:01.826 --> 46:04.186
People can vape without...

46:04.195 --> 46:07.155
As his hover booster
board burst into...

46:07.164 --> 46:09.034
Congresswoman, let me
interrupt you just for a moment,

46:09.035 --> 46:10.902
We've got some
breaking news out of Miami.

46:10.903 --> 46:13.000
Stand by, if you will.

46:13.002 --> 46:15.840
Right now, in Miami,
Justin Bieber has been arrested

46:15.841 --> 46:17.198
On a number of charges that...

46:18.639 --> 46:21.008
What we call right wing and
liberal media in this country

46:21.009 --> 46:22.739
Are really just two
different strategies

46:22.744 --> 46:26.413
Of the same kind of nihilistic
lizard-brain sensationalism.

46:26.414 --> 46:29.252
There's nothing but murders,
bombs, and panda births

46:29.253 --> 46:31.050
Delivering to
thickening couch potatoes

46:31.051 --> 46:35.451
In ever briefer blasts
of 40, 30, 20 seconds.

46:37.689 --> 46:39.359
The world's most
powerful investment bank

46:39.360 --> 46:42.487
Is a great vampire squid wrapped
around the face of humanity,

46:42.493 --> 46:45.563
Relentlessly jamming its
blood funnel into anything

46:45.564 --> 46:47.862
That smells like money.

46:47.864 --> 46:49.864
And the funny part about
that is, of course,

46:49.866 --> 46:52.526
Vampire squids don't
have blood funnels,

46:52.535 --> 46:56.095
So we had a fact checking
issue with that, and it was...

46:56.105 --> 46:57.995
But I thought that was part
of what made that funny

46:58.006 --> 47:01.006
Was that, you know, it was
a nonsensical image, right.

47:01.009 --> 47:02.709
You know, you had
this thing that was

47:02.710 --> 47:04.340
At once terrifying,
and ridiculous.

47:04.344 --> 47:07.384
I thought that summed up
what the bank was all about.

47:12.582 --> 47:16.082
In news from Iraq, at least
16 people were killed Thursday

47:16.085 --> 47:19.545
In clashes between us troops
and Shia militias in Baghdad.

47:19.555 --> 47:23.155
The dead included a photographer
for the Reuters news agency,

47:23.157 --> 47:24.517
And his driver.

47:24.525 --> 47:27.425
They apparently came under
fire from a us helicopter.

48:15.604 --> 48:17.744
In December,
democracy now! Traveled

48:17.745 --> 48:19.669
To the Calais refugee camp.

48:19.674 --> 48:22.074
The largest
refugee camp in France,

48:22.076 --> 48:24.376
About two hours north of Paris.

48:24.378 --> 48:27.478
Six to seven thousand
people are living there,

48:27.481 --> 48:29.481
Camped out in makeshift tents.

48:30.850 --> 48:33.250
Occasionally
people stop to talk,

48:33.253 --> 48:36.121
But we've been
warned over and over

48:36.122 --> 48:38.962
That people don't want
their faces shown.

48:39.690 --> 48:41.158
They're afraid.

48:41.159 --> 48:43.089
They're afraid of
being targeted here

48:43.094 --> 48:44.631
And they're afraid
their families

48:44.632 --> 48:46.258
Will be targeted at home.

48:47.495 --> 48:49.555
Were there drone strikes...

48:49.564 --> 48:51.434
Yes, there were drone attacks.

48:51.435 --> 48:55.301
They are always killing innocent
people in the villages.

48:55.302 --> 49:00.139
Civilians become very angry and
they join the group of Taliban.

49:00.140 --> 49:03.440
So, what do you think
the us should be doing now?

49:03.443 --> 49:06.978
You know, us is just
increasing the war.

49:06.979 --> 49:10.579
Actually, us don't want
to finish the war.

49:10.581 --> 49:12.181
It's their game.

49:12.182 --> 49:14.516
It's the game of...

49:14.517 --> 49:17.317
George W. Bush, Obama.

49:17.319 --> 49:21.419
They don't care about the
people who are dying there.

49:21.423 --> 49:24.561
President Obama said the war
is ending in Afghanistan.

49:24.562 --> 49:25.929
Do you see it ending?

49:27.727 --> 49:29.657
Until Americans
leave Afghanistan,

49:29.663 --> 49:32.297
It will be not ending.

49:32.298 --> 49:33.758
Never.

49:33.766 --> 49:35.226
The map of this camp,

49:35.234 --> 49:39.336
It's a map of where
refugees are from.

49:39.337 --> 49:41.167
Most of these countries
have been bombed

49:41.172 --> 49:43.106
By the United States.

49:43.107 --> 49:45.607
Syria, Afghanistan,

49:45.609 --> 49:47.339
Iraq, Sudan.

49:48.577 --> 49:50.677
I didn't think about it,
but that is true.

49:51.946 --> 49:53.476
What's very important to explain

49:53.481 --> 49:55.411
And what's
systematically lacking

49:55.416 --> 49:57.816
In all the accounts
that I had come across

49:57.818 --> 49:59.618
In the mainstream media,

49:59.619 --> 50:01.149
Why is this happening?

50:01.153 --> 50:02.753
Why are these people
where they are?

50:02.754 --> 50:06.723
Why are they suffering
the most inhumane conditions,

50:06.724 --> 50:09.192
The most abject degradation,

50:09.193 --> 50:11.693
And of course, it's very
important to have empathy

50:11.695 --> 50:14.325
And solidarity for the
suffering of these people,

50:14.330 --> 50:15.960
But we can't think
that the suffering

50:15.964 --> 50:17.364
Has fallen out of the sky,

50:17.365 --> 50:19.125
And they're just
particularly benighted

50:19.133 --> 50:22.271
Because they happen to have been
the subject of that, right.

50:22.272 --> 50:24.499
There are policies
that have been enacted.

50:24.504 --> 50:26.504
There are decisions
that have been made.

50:26.506 --> 50:28.206
There are bombs
that have been dropped.

50:28.207 --> 50:31.167
As a consequence of which,
these millions of people

50:31.176 --> 50:33.136
Are destitute in
the way that they are,

50:33.144 --> 50:36.346
And we have to allow
them to tell that story.

50:36.347 --> 50:40.247
Do you think the
Russian, Syrian, french,

50:40.250 --> 50:43.718
British bombing of
Syria will save it?

50:43.719 --> 50:45.119
No, no, no.

50:45.120 --> 50:47.287
It's not the solution.

50:47.288 --> 50:51.088
You can't protect someone
by killing someone else.

50:58.564 --> 51:01.202
In international waters,
in the gulf of tonkin,

51:01.203 --> 51:03.169
Destroyers of the
United States navy

51:03.170 --> 51:06.397
Are assigned routine
patrols from time to time.

51:06.403 --> 51:09.338
Sunday, August the 2nd, 1964,

51:09.339 --> 51:12.269
The destroyer, Maddox,
was on such a patrol.

51:12.275 --> 51:15.305
Shortly after noon,
the calm of the day is broken

51:15.311 --> 51:17.081
As general quarters sound.

51:18.512 --> 51:20.752
In a deliberate
and unprovoked action,

51:20.753 --> 51:24.648
Three north Vietnam pt boats
unleash a torpedo attack

51:24.651 --> 51:26.351
Against the Maddox.

51:26.352 --> 51:28.692
A classic example of
I.F. Stone's ability

51:28.693 --> 51:32.387
To ferret out something
when no one else was doing it

51:32.390 --> 51:36.960
Was the gulf of tonkin excuse
for going into Vietnam.

52:07.656 --> 52:12.486
Three weeks after we had
the so-called attack

52:12.494 --> 52:16.697
By the north Vietnamese,
Izzy read all the after reports,

52:16.698 --> 52:20.298
And he said, "where... where's
the debris if we had been hit?"

52:20.301 --> 52:22.331
Why isn't there more
being talked about?"

52:22.336 --> 52:24.766
And he said there were
all kinds of excuses

52:24.771 --> 52:27.241
Why this little, tiny
country would go against

52:27.242 --> 52:28.870
The largest fleet in the world,

52:28.874 --> 52:32.509
Except the fact that it
might have been provoked.

52:32.510 --> 52:35.680
All of the media was just
following it right into war,

52:35.681 --> 52:38.049
As was congress,
and I keep thinking

52:38.050 --> 52:41.248
If the mainstream media
had followed Izzy,

52:41.251 --> 52:43.751
We might not have had
that ten year disaster.

52:52.727 --> 52:55.427
We hadn't been able to
get it through our heads

52:55.429 --> 52:58.129
That this is a political war.

52:58.131 --> 52:59.531
All you have to ask yourself is

52:59.532 --> 53:03.132
Why is it that here
are Vietnamese

53:03.135 --> 53:04.665
On one side, on our side,

53:04.669 --> 53:07.569
And here are the same
Vietnamese on the other side.

53:07.571 --> 53:09.871
And on one side, they have
very little in the way of arms.

53:09.873 --> 53:13.111
They have no air force,
no napalm, no big boom-boom,

53:13.112 --> 53:15.009
And they really
fight magnificently.

53:15.010 --> 53:17.710
And on our side, you have
five times as many troops,

53:17.712 --> 53:20.750
All that equipment, all that
firepower, all that artillery,

53:20.751 --> 53:22.578
And they're not worth a damn.

53:22.583 --> 53:25.153
A lot of people protested
I.F. Stone's being on,

53:25.154 --> 53:27.722
Because can you imagine
he had the nerve

53:27.723 --> 53:31.356
To say things against
our war policy?

53:31.357 --> 53:32.857
Well, it was bold at the time

53:32.858 --> 53:36.327
When we were suffering
with all kinds of things.

53:36.328 --> 53:38.698
Assassinations,
and the Vietnam war,

53:38.699 --> 53:41.457
A subject on which stone
was quite brilliant,

53:41.466 --> 53:42.996
And how we got into it

53:43.000 --> 53:45.100
And how we were probably
never gonna get out of it

53:45.102 --> 53:46.572
The way we were
going and it was...

53:46.573 --> 53:48.938
Took guts to say those things.

53:48.939 --> 53:51.339
The extreme right and
the hate mail writers

53:51.341 --> 53:53.008
Were always ready to go.

53:53.009 --> 53:56.079
Ask any solider back from
Vietnam, he'll agree with me.

53:56.080 --> 53:58.508
I don't mean to say there
aren't brave men among them,

53:58.513 --> 54:01.448
And some good troops,
but on the whole,

54:01.449 --> 54:03.679
The men on one side are fighting

54:03.684 --> 54:06.354
And the men on the other side
don't care and are deserting.

54:06.355 --> 54:07.653
Why is this?

54:07.654 --> 54:09.423
Why, because the men
on the other side

54:09.424 --> 54:11.391
Feel they're
fighting for freedom.

54:11.392 --> 54:12.990
They're fighting
for freedom from...

54:12.991 --> 54:16.691
From domination by the white
man, and by the westerner.

54:16.694 --> 54:19.764
I.F. Stone would be debunking
the official fictions

54:19.765 --> 54:22.333
As soon as government
was spewing them.

54:22.334 --> 54:25.432
Whether it was during
the Joe McCarthy era,

54:25.435 --> 54:28.365
Or all of the lies
about Vietnam.

54:28.371 --> 54:30.571
You could read
Izzy stone within a week,

54:30.573 --> 54:32.773
And he was debunking
these fictions.

54:34.342 --> 54:37.578
We need to know
what governments do.

54:37.579 --> 54:39.709
We need to know what's real,

54:39.714 --> 54:42.714
And we need to know
what's bullshit.

54:43.782 --> 54:45.482
And that's the biggest problem,

54:45.484 --> 54:49.252
And Izzy was great

54:49.253 --> 54:51.953
At saying, "hey, I checked."

54:51.955 --> 54:54.085
This is bullshit."

54:54.090 --> 54:57.559
Just as Izzy wrote and
published I.F. Stone's weekly

54:57.560 --> 54:59.590
Out of his home with his wife,

54:59.595 --> 55:01.655
Esther, managing the accounts,

55:01.663 --> 55:05.499
Tom Engelhardt with his
blog, Tomdispatch. Com,

55:05.500 --> 55:08.530
Is another example
of how a journalist

55:08.536 --> 55:11.236
Working from
a small office at home

55:11.238 --> 55:13.638
Can reach a very wide audience

55:13.640 --> 55:16.508
With independent
reporting and analysis.

55:16.509 --> 55:17.978
On how I started Tomdispatch,

55:17.979 --> 55:20.637
You'd have to go back
to literally to 9/11,

55:20.646 --> 55:23.576
And our news began
to constrict, you know,

55:23.582 --> 55:26.020
In a way I hadn't seen, even
at the height of the cold war,

55:26.021 --> 55:27.477
As far as I was concerned.

55:27.485 --> 55:30.445
And I suddenly
realized that out there,

55:30.454 --> 55:31.991
There was another kind of news.

55:31.992 --> 55:33.988
I started obsessively
gathering this stuff,

55:33.990 --> 55:36.460
And then, and writing
little comments,

55:36.461 --> 55:38.889
And my little comments
became a kind of commentary

55:38.894 --> 55:41.132
And then this was the
miracle of the internet,

55:41.133 --> 55:42.696
People started jumping on.

55:42.697 --> 55:44.427
People started writing me and
saying, "can I be on your list?"

55:44.432 --> 55:46.002
I didn't even really
know I had a list,

55:46.003 --> 55:48.100
And suddenly, I had
a list of 400 people

55:48.102 --> 55:51.340
Including journalists and I
mean, Susan Sontag wrote me,

55:51.341 --> 55:52.538
I mean, out of the blue.

55:52.539 --> 55:53.599
I didn't know Susan Sontag.

55:53.606 --> 55:55.166
I'm now almost 71.

55:55.174 --> 55:56.874
I'm plunged into,
I was from the beginning,

55:56.875 --> 55:59.175
Plunged into a world
of much younger people.

55:59.177 --> 56:00.807
I had no idea what I was doing,

56:00.811 --> 56:03.381
But I had been working
as a book editor

56:03.382 --> 56:04.680
With great writers for years.

56:04.681 --> 56:07.111
Chalmers Johnson,
all sorts of people.

56:07.116 --> 56:09.746
And I started asking them
once this thing started,

56:09.751 --> 56:12.051
I started asking them if
they wanted to, you know,

56:12.053 --> 56:15.391
Write and it was like this
kind of communal activity,

56:15.392 --> 56:18.819
And it's turned from that thing
that it was into what it is now,

56:18.825 --> 56:21.555
Which is my little
intros and then a piece.

56:21.561 --> 56:23.631
I mean, it could be by me
or by any one of a...

56:23.632 --> 56:26.499
I think a pretty
striking set of writers.

56:38.407 --> 56:40.507
The establishment reporters,
without a doubt,

56:40.509 --> 56:42.478
Know a lot of things
I don't know,

56:42.479 --> 56:44.937
But a lot of what
they know isn't true.

56:44.946 --> 56:48.976
He was a fantastic
journalist and the...

56:48.982 --> 56:50.749
As he himself pointed out,

56:50.750 --> 56:53.418
The greatest contribution
to his career

56:53.419 --> 56:55.019
Was his being excluded.

56:56.320 --> 56:57.720
He didn't have,
as he pointed out,

56:57.722 --> 56:59.391
He didn't have to waste his time

56:59.392 --> 57:01.990
Going to press conferences
'cause he wasn't invited,

57:01.992 --> 57:04.692
So he didn't have to hear
all the deceit and the lies

57:04.694 --> 57:06.864
And so he didn't have to
waste his time repeating them.

57:06.865 --> 57:09.632
He could just go
straight to the documents,

57:09.633 --> 57:12.671
To the historical record,
see what's happening,

57:12.672 --> 57:14.497
And he did it brilliantly.

57:18.037 --> 57:19.697
Going in the
white house and going

57:19.706 --> 57:21.906
And asking questions
of the press secretary,

57:21.908 --> 57:23.938
It's a job that some
people have to do.

57:23.943 --> 57:27.612
It's not often that you develop
new information from doing that,

57:27.613 --> 57:30.413
And it just becomes
a battle of spins.

57:30.415 --> 57:31.875
I do remember going once

57:31.883 --> 57:34.851
And Ari Fleischer
was press secretary

57:34.852 --> 57:38.852
And he kept, just
saying the same thing.

57:38.855 --> 57:41.315
"No, it's true, it's true."

57:41.324 --> 57:44.094
I go, "but this report
just came out from wherever"

57:44.095 --> 57:46.963
And it says that actually
that didn't happen."

57:46.964 --> 57:49.200
And he goes,
"no, but it did happen."

57:49.201 --> 57:52.997
And I really felt like I was
talking to a guy who was saying,

57:53.000 --> 57:54.430
"the sky is green."

57:54.434 --> 57:56.734
And I would say, "no, no, no,
actually, the sky is blue."

57:56.736 --> 57:59.696
He goes, "no, no,
the sky is green."

57:59.705 --> 58:03.005
And you can only do that so
much, and people, you know,

58:03.008 --> 58:05.578
Who are on that side
will say, damn it is!

58:06.743 --> 58:08.813
We ask each nation
on the security council

58:08.814 --> 58:11.982
To weigh the merits that make
a decision about war and peace,

58:11.983 --> 58:15.850
And if anybody thinks that
there are nations, like Mexico,

58:15.851 --> 58:18.951
Whose vote could be bought
on the basis of a trade issue

58:18.954 --> 58:21.792
Or something else like that,
I think you're giving...

58:21.793 --> 58:24.320
Do a grave injustice
to the independence

58:24.325 --> 58:26.755
And the judgment of the
leaders of other nations.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.560
Think about the implications
what you're saying.

58:28.561 --> 58:31.631
You're saying that the leaders
of other nations are buy-able

58:31.632 --> 58:33.860
And that is not
an acceptable proposition.

58:37.001 --> 58:38.071
Thank you.

58:51.679 --> 58:53.609
Good afternoon, everybody.

58:53.615 --> 58:56.315
What concerns does
the president have

58:56.317 --> 59:00.386
About the possibility that
Donald trump could someday

59:00.387 --> 59:02.487
Be the us commander in chief?

59:02.489 --> 59:04.689
The president has confidence

59:04.691 --> 59:06.921
That if Mr. Trump is
the republican nominee,

59:06.926 --> 59:08.826
He will not win
the general election.

59:08.827 --> 59:11.287
It's kind of a, you know,
a bit of a kabuki,

59:11.296 --> 59:15.556
Theatrical production each day,
and so he's here facing,

59:15.566 --> 59:18.026
I don't know how
many reporters, 70...

59:18.035 --> 59:19.465
70 reporters or so,

59:19.469 --> 59:22.938
Who really want to
drive him off message,

59:22.939 --> 59:26.009
And so he has to come out
and seem more or less

59:26.010 --> 59:28.508
To be answering questions
without saying anything

59:28.510 --> 59:29.910
That's gonna make news.

59:29.911 --> 59:33.211
What is the president
hearing from us allies

59:33.214 --> 59:36.624
And those who participate
in us military operations

59:36.625 --> 59:38.217
Alongside Americans?

59:38.218 --> 59:40.918
I'm not gonna be able to
share any secret details

59:40.920 --> 59:43.120
Of conversations that
the president has had

59:43.122 --> 59:45.056
With other world leaders,

59:45.057 --> 59:47.917
But there are global
consequences for arguments

59:47.926 --> 59:50.086
That are made by
domestic politicians.

59:50.094 --> 59:52.194
But I think, you know,

59:52.196 --> 59:55.056
The white house should
recognize that the media,

59:55.065 --> 59:57.925
Which represents the public
to some degree, you know,

59:57.934 --> 59:59.734
Has the right to ask questions

59:59.735 --> 01:00:01.735
And that sometimes
they have to answer things

01:00:01.737 --> 01:00:03.367
That aren't really, maybe,

01:00:03.371 --> 01:00:06.141
What they most are interested
in talking about that day.

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:13.683
Hello?

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:16.205
Oh, I wouldn't... I mean,

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:18.013
I thought we already
went over this,

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:20.954
But you will not be identified
as a source for anything.

01:00:20.955 --> 01:00:25.587
Your name will not, you know,
appear as, you know,

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:28.388
Being connected
to these documents

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:32.226
And certainly no quotes
from anything we talked about.

01:00:32.227 --> 01:00:36.296
One of David corn's major
scoops was the 47% video,

01:00:36.297 --> 01:00:40.327
Where you had presidential
candidate, mitt Romney,

01:00:40.334 --> 01:00:42.934
Do a $50,000-a-plate dinner

01:00:42.936 --> 01:00:47.236
Talking about how 47%
of the us public were moochers.

01:01:00.051 --> 01:01:02.987
When this comes out,
thanks to David corn,

01:01:02.988 --> 01:01:05.888
It changes the momentum
of the 2012 race

01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:07.660
Between Romney and Obama.

01:01:19.267 --> 01:01:22.436
The president of the united
states defeats mitt Romney

01:01:22.437 --> 01:01:24.797
In this... at this
time right now,

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:26.266
We have made this projection.

01:01:26.274 --> 01:01:29.009
So, the president
wins this battle.

01:01:34.148 --> 01:01:37.148
When the source
with the 47% video

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:40.186
Is looking to bring
that to the public,

01:01:40.187 --> 01:01:43.887
He didn't take it
to NBC news or CBS news.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:46.260
He takes it to David corn
in mother Jones

01:01:46.261 --> 01:01:49.327
Because he'd seen
the investigative work

01:01:49.328 --> 01:01:52.958
In the previous months that
corn had been doing on Romney.

01:01:57.368 --> 01:02:00.068
Okay, here's the
list of the folks

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:02.237
Who testified at the trial,

01:02:02.238 --> 01:02:04.368
So they're the ones
we need to find.

01:02:04.373 --> 01:02:05.406
Will do.

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:10.940
There's new intelligence today

01:02:10.945 --> 01:02:13.905
Indicating Saddam Hussein
has stepped up his efforts

01:02:13.914 --> 01:02:15.648
To obtain nuclear weapons.

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:18.449
The latest information,
us officials saying

01:02:18.451 --> 01:02:20.451
That over the past 14 months,

01:02:20.453 --> 01:02:24.788
They have seen Saddam Hussein
trying to obtain weapons

01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:28.219
To try and build an atomic bomb.

01:02:28.225 --> 01:02:32.725
It was basically sort
of a feedback loop.

01:02:32.728 --> 01:02:34.788
The administration was out there

01:02:34.796 --> 01:02:37.226
Starting to beat the
drums for war in Iraq.

01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:41.066
The new york times, anxious
to be ahead of the pack,

01:02:41.067 --> 01:02:43.797
And to get the real scoop

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:46.137
When they found people with...

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:48.868
Administration officials
who were presenting evidence

01:02:48.874 --> 01:02:50.774
That wasn't that strong,

01:02:50.775 --> 01:02:52.805
But the new york times
went with the story

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.110
And then dick Cheney
cited that story to say,

01:02:55.112 --> 01:02:56.579
"look, the new york times."

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.280
It was already coming
out of the administration.

01:02:58.281 --> 01:02:59.711
He now is trying,

01:02:59.715 --> 01:03:01.875
Through his illicit
procurement network,

01:03:01.883 --> 01:03:05.518
To acquire the
equipment he needs

01:03:05.519 --> 01:03:08.419
To be able to enrich
uranium to make the bombs.

01:03:08.421 --> 01:03:09.951
Specifically aluminum tubes.

01:03:09.955 --> 01:03:12.155
There's a story in
the new york times this morning.

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:16.990
The lead up to the war in Iraq.

01:03:16.995 --> 01:03:20.395
The particularly egregious
case is the new york times,

01:03:20.398 --> 01:03:23.566
There's no question
about it, because it...

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:26.067
It ran stories

01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:29.799
Contrary to the truth.

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:33.735
It ran stories that the sources

01:03:33.742 --> 01:03:35.709
Had planted information

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:39.840
That should have been checked
out and the sources were...

01:03:39.846 --> 01:03:41.706
Were questionable to begin with

01:03:41.714 --> 01:03:44.114
In terms of their
own objectives,

01:03:44.116 --> 01:03:46.676
So the times is
a particular case

01:03:46.685 --> 01:03:49.385
Of particularly great failing.

01:03:49.387 --> 01:03:50.987
There's nothing
like experiencing

01:03:50.988 --> 01:03:53.088
The world's finest journalism

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:54.960
In its original form.

01:03:56.391 --> 01:03:57.961
And I want to
attribute the times,

01:03:57.962 --> 01:03:59.890
I don't want to
talk about, obviously,

01:03:59.895 --> 01:04:01.825
Specific intelligence sources,

01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:05.199
But it's now public,
that in fact,

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.270
He has been seeking to
acquire the kinds of tubes

01:04:08.271 --> 01:04:10.669
That are necessary
to build a centrifuge.

01:04:12.205 --> 01:04:13.995
I remember, particularly,

01:04:14.006 --> 01:04:17.036
Watching Cheney
on meet the press.

01:04:19.208 --> 01:04:21.738
And throwing out this stuff,

01:04:21.744 --> 01:04:24.644
And saying to my wife, saying,

01:04:24.646 --> 01:04:25.946
"this is bullshit.

01:04:25.947 --> 01:04:27.747
There's something
missing here."

01:04:27.748 --> 01:04:31.078
There will always
be some uncertainty

01:04:31.084 --> 01:04:34.154
About how quickly he can
acquire nuclear weapons,

01:04:34.155 --> 01:04:37.523
But we don't want the smoking
gun to be a mushroom cloud.

01:04:38.722 --> 01:04:40.262
Two days, I think it was,

01:04:40.263 --> 01:04:43.387
Before the war was
launched in March 2003.

01:04:43.393 --> 01:04:46.128
The Washington post
had a great story

01:04:46.129 --> 01:04:47.699
And the headline
was something like,

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:51.366
"much of the bush
administration's case for war

01:04:51.367 --> 01:04:55.236
Is inaccurate or
wrong, experts say."

01:04:55.237 --> 01:04:58.706
And it was on page a19,
it was, you know, inside,

01:04:58.707 --> 01:05:02.276
And the question that
I've had since that point

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:05.307
Is under what definition of news

01:05:05.313 --> 01:05:08.348
Is that not a front page story?

01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:10.879
That experts say
administration's case for war

01:05:10.884 --> 01:05:12.317
Is wrong.

01:05:31.503 --> 01:05:32.836
Two trumps.

01:05:32.837 --> 01:05:34.437
- Yeah, two trumps.
- And I added a line.

01:05:38.139 --> 01:05:40.469
Yes, Lisa, this is the order,

01:05:40.475 --> 01:05:42.405
And what's circled
and not circled.

01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:45.210
I think that on the
Lloyd Blankfein one,

01:05:45.212 --> 01:05:48.180
I would end on
my tsunami analogy.

01:05:48.181 --> 01:05:49.751
"And it's about to
crash on their head."

01:05:49.752 --> 01:05:50.879
On their heads, yes.

01:05:50.883 --> 01:05:52.483
Okay.

01:05:52.484 --> 01:05:54.322
I.F. Stone was onto
something really smart

01:05:54.323 --> 01:05:56.088
With the subscription business.

01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:58.487
What a lot of people miss
about that business model,

01:05:58.489 --> 01:06:00.489
Which in general was
a smart business model,

01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:03.761
It puts your financial
incentives in the right place.

01:06:03.762 --> 01:06:06.990
If your financial incentives
are to please advertisers,

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:09.256
You will please
advertisers, right.

01:06:09.264 --> 01:06:12.164
But in the long run,
you want to incentivize yourself

01:06:12.166 --> 01:06:14.266
To be aligned
with your audience.

01:06:14.268 --> 01:06:15.568
The way you're aligned
with your audience

01:06:15.569 --> 01:06:17.937
Is if your audience
is paying you.

01:06:17.938 --> 01:06:19.968
So, if you go in
the wrong direction,

01:06:19.973 --> 01:06:22.741
They punish you
by saying, "I'm leaving"

01:06:22.742 --> 01:06:25.310
And I'm not paying you
the subscription anymore."

01:06:25.311 --> 01:06:27.111
That was true of I.F. Stone
with his newsletter,

01:06:27.112 --> 01:06:28.642
It's true of our show

01:06:28.646 --> 01:06:31.276
Because we have a subscription
model on our website.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.220
Now, you can't get
carried away with it,

01:06:39.221 --> 01:06:41.291
Because sometimes you have
to act out of principle,

01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:43.219
Even if it loses
you subscribers.

01:06:43.224 --> 01:06:45.662
For example, after
president Obama was elected,

01:06:45.663 --> 01:06:47.128
I began to criticize him

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:49.027
For some of the things
that I realized, whoa,

01:06:49.028 --> 01:06:50.458
Well, that's not
a progressive position,

01:06:50.462 --> 01:06:52.400
And that's not
a progressive position.

01:06:52.401 --> 01:06:54.527
And in the beginning we
lost a lot of subscribers

01:06:54.532 --> 01:06:56.502
'cause people said,
"whoa, no, wait a minute now."

01:06:56.503 --> 01:06:58.469
We worked hard to get
president Obama elected.

01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:00.528
"You seem like you're being
disrespectful to him."

01:07:00.536 --> 01:07:02.336
Well, there you got
to stand on principle

01:07:02.337 --> 01:07:04.937
And we survived that and
then those guys came back,

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:07.669
And even more came back
when they realized,

01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:09.135
"oh damn, you were right."

01:07:09.143 --> 01:07:12.278
Hillary Clinton is tired

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:15.109
Of the Bernie sanders
camp's lies, she says.

01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:16.745
In fact, here, let me show you.

01:07:16.749 --> 01:07:17.949
This is when
she had a run-in

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.419
With a Greenpeace activist.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.318
Can we talk about
climate change?

01:07:34.363 --> 01:07:37.332
When people make
these kinds of claims,

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:39.502
Which now I think
have been debunked,

01:07:39.503 --> 01:07:42.171
Actually the Washington post
said three Pinocchios.

01:07:42.172 --> 01:07:44.300
The new york times
also analyzed it.

01:07:44.305 --> 01:07:46.565
She says that,
"oh no, it's debunked."

01:07:46.573 --> 01:07:48.642
Okay, great, I'll go
to the source itself

01:07:48.643 --> 01:07:50.510
That quote, unquote,
"debunked" the story.

01:07:50.511 --> 01:07:51.539
Washington post.

01:08:01.017 --> 01:08:04.947
So, that adds up to all the
donations to Hillary Clinton,

01:08:04.954 --> 01:08:06.723
Up to more than
$4.5 million,

01:08:06.724 --> 01:08:08.091
So they acknowledge it.

01:08:08.092 --> 01:08:09.990
They acknowledge it,
right there, right?

01:08:09.991 --> 01:08:11.560
But it's still only two percent

01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:13.589
Of the total contributions
received by Clinton

01:08:13.594 --> 01:08:15.394
And outside groups backing her.

01:08:15.395 --> 01:08:17.955
Now, that's true, but think
about that for a second.

01:08:17.964 --> 01:08:20.202
Their excuse for her
is, "yeah, I know",

01:08:20.203 --> 01:08:22.698
She took four and a half million
bucks from the oil guys,

01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:25.868
But she's taking so much
more from the others.

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:28.500
The bribes that the oil
and gas companies gave her

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:30.935
"Are small compared to
what the banks gave her."

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.307
See, not guilty.

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:34.938
Bernie sanders is a liar.

01:08:34.943 --> 01:08:36.912
So, Elizabeth warren,
that's an interview...

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.881
I don't think there
is even video of that.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.479
I think it's IB times.

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:44.880
But we do have the panel on
morning Joe and on Hannity.

01:08:44.884 --> 01:08:46.551
And also Geraldo?

01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:49.591
After the meeting, we had
a few videos that we're doing

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:53.818
And to just basically get a good
round... round out the stories.

01:08:53.823 --> 01:08:57.563
Three years later, some senator
says, "I never said that."

01:08:57.564 --> 01:08:59.591
Even if you can't find
it somewhere online,

01:08:59.595 --> 01:09:00.526
I still have it.

01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:02.060
So, I don't get rid of anything.

01:09:02.064 --> 01:09:03.933
So, we have tons
and tons of things

01:09:03.934 --> 01:09:06.970
That I just have saved of
what everyone has said ever

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:07.997
That we've ever done.

01:09:08.002 --> 01:09:09.432
There's a lot, yeah.

01:09:09.435 --> 01:09:12.095
I don't envy the guy
who has to cut it all.

01:09:12.104 --> 01:09:14.265
I could toss you
a couple raw videos.

01:09:14.273 --> 01:09:15.573
You can cut those down.

01:09:15.573 --> 01:09:17.343
Yeah, by me,
you mean Arthur, right?

01:09:17.344 --> 01:09:18.572
Good luck with that.

01:09:18.576 --> 01:09:20.676
- Okay, thank you.
- All right, man.

01:09:20.678 --> 01:09:24.278
I'm amused at people who claim
that the governments don't lie.

01:09:24.281 --> 01:09:27.019
Really, do you know
human beings that never lie?

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.747
Let alone human beings
who need to cover their ass

01:09:29.752 --> 01:09:31.122
And protect their job?

01:09:31.122 --> 01:09:34.461
Let alone people who need
to do all that in public?

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:36.716
Of course, they lie!

01:09:36.725 --> 01:09:38.215
Of course they do.

01:09:38.225 --> 01:09:40.826
When is the last time
you heard CNN say

01:09:40.828 --> 01:09:42.728
The pentagon is lying?

01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:46.158
Isn't it amazing that in these
decades of CNN's existence,

01:09:46.165 --> 01:09:47.654
They have never
uttered that sentence.

01:09:47.666 --> 01:09:51.026
So the pentagon has never
lied, according to CNN.

01:09:56.473 --> 01:09:59.273
Congressman, but overall,
I'm a deficit hawk too.

01:09:59.275 --> 01:10:01.005
I don't want out
of control spending,

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.710
So then I assume
as a deficit hawk,

01:10:02.711 --> 01:10:04.741
You also want to cut
defense spending

01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:07.946
And you want to raise
taxes on the rich, right?

01:10:07.949 --> 01:10:10.419
Well, I think the first
purpose of this government

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:11.678
Is to defend the nation,

01:10:11.685 --> 01:10:13.245
And if we cut defense
to the extent

01:10:13.253 --> 01:10:14.753
That we're no longer safe,

01:10:14.754 --> 01:10:16.622
Let me suggest to you,
there's nothing that would have

01:10:16.623 --> 01:10:18.122
A more negative impact
on our economy.

01:10:18.123 --> 01:10:19.793
Nineteen percent of the deficit

01:10:19.794 --> 01:10:22.359
Is defense spending,

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.990
And we've spent more on defense

01:10:23.994 --> 01:10:26.794
Than the entire rest
of the world combined,

01:10:26.796 --> 01:10:29.826
But you still think we cannot
cut a nickel from there.

01:10:29.832 --> 01:10:33.568
We need every nuke, every sub,
every aircraft carrier,

01:10:33.569 --> 01:10:35.969
Otherwise we're not gonna
be able to out-nuke Iran,

01:10:35.971 --> 01:10:37.471
Is that the logic?

01:10:37.472 --> 01:10:39.472
When Cenk was first
working at MSNBC,

01:10:39.474 --> 01:10:41.111
I just assumed
he was on cloud nine,

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.838
Because he wanted it so bad
and then there was this one week

01:10:43.844 --> 01:10:46.744
Where they flew me into new york

01:10:46.746 --> 01:10:49.846
And I helped them produce
the television show.

01:10:49.849 --> 01:10:52.219
Right then and there,
I knew it wasn't right for us,

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.618
But I didn't say anything.

01:10:53.619 --> 01:10:55.349
I just kinda like,
sat back and waited to see

01:10:55.354 --> 01:10:58.524
If Cenk was gonna do what
I thought he was gonna do.

01:10:58.525 --> 01:11:01.461
Phil griffin, who's the head of
MSNBC, pulls me into his office.

01:11:01.462 --> 01:11:02.759
He sits me down and he says,

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.760
"Cenk, I was just in Washington,

01:11:05.763 --> 01:11:07.932
And they're not happy
with your tone."

01:11:07.933 --> 01:11:11.600
And I sat back in my seat, like,
"oh my god, it's happening."

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.101
Right, this is like a movie!

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.902
They're... they're
giving me this speech.

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:18.272
You know, some people
told me that you were dumb.

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:19.873
I think you're smart.

01:11:19.874 --> 01:11:21.874
In fact, I think you're
smart enough to understand

01:11:21.876 --> 01:11:23.776
A situation when
it's explained to you.

01:11:23.777 --> 01:11:26.937
And he said, "look, I want to
be clear with you about this",

01:11:26.946 --> 01:11:28.446
So just cool it.

01:11:28.447 --> 01:11:29.747
"Bring it down
a little bit."

01:11:29.748 --> 01:11:31.448
Now, if I felt that you had

01:11:31.449 --> 01:11:32.819
The welfare of
the state at heart,

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:36.677
Like I have, I'd say
you were a man to watch.

01:11:36.686 --> 01:11:38.586
So, they would say things like,

01:11:38.587 --> 01:11:40.987
"we need you to act
like a senator."

01:11:40.989 --> 01:11:42.289
And I thought, "why?"

01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:43.590
Why on good god's green earth

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:44.861
"Would you want to act
like a senator?"

01:11:44.862 --> 01:11:46.458
Does that mean
I should lie more?

01:11:46.459 --> 01:11:48.259
I should be more fake?

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.860
People don't like senators.

01:11:49.861 --> 01:11:52.291
Congress, at that point,
is at an approval rating

01:11:52.296 --> 01:11:55.026
Floating between
7 and 11 percent.

01:11:55.032 --> 01:11:56.699
They hate senators!

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.440
They don't have
to tell an anchor

01:12:05.441 --> 01:12:07.410
Coming into the
mainstream media,

01:12:07.411 --> 01:12:08.976
"hey, be pro-government."

01:12:08.977 --> 01:12:11.007
Although with me, I was so
thick-headed they had to.

01:12:11.012 --> 01:12:12.212
Right.

01:12:12.213 --> 01:12:13.680
They just don't hire that guy,

01:12:13.681 --> 01:12:15.381
And if they make the
mistake of hiring him,

01:12:15.382 --> 01:12:17.082
They demote him
or they fire him,

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.983
And then the message
is clear in the building.

01:12:18.984 --> 01:12:22.653
"Shh, we don't criticize
the powers that be."

01:12:22.654 --> 01:12:24.654
We don't criticize corporations.

01:12:24.656 --> 01:12:26.556
We are a giant corporation.

01:12:26.557 --> 01:12:28.917
We don't take on
the establishment,

01:12:28.926 --> 01:12:30.456
"We are the
establishment."

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.660
And the guys who play
ball get promotions

01:12:32.662 --> 01:12:36.131
And everyone in the building
sees them getting promotions.

01:12:36.132 --> 01:12:38.666
So, it is
an evolutionary process

01:12:38.667 --> 01:12:41.867
By which the mainstream media
gets the product that it wants.

01:12:43.102 --> 01:12:46.402
I think what happened
to Cenk Uygur at MSNBC

01:12:46.406 --> 01:12:47.906
Illuminates the process

01:12:47.907 --> 01:12:51.476
Leading to what
Noam Chomsky calls,

01:12:51.477 --> 01:12:53.837
"manufacturing consent."

01:12:53.846 --> 01:12:55.976
Corporate news outlets
often end up

01:12:55.981 --> 01:12:59.216
Being more propagandistic
than journalistic.

01:12:59.217 --> 01:13:02.817
Manufactured consent
makes sure that the ignorant

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.450
And meddlesome majority
keeps out of things.

01:13:06.456 --> 01:13:08.886
So, if they want...

01:13:08.891 --> 01:13:11.861
For decades they've wanted
national healthcare,

01:13:11.862 --> 01:13:14.630
But they don't understand,
so keep them out of it.

01:13:14.631 --> 01:13:16.629
They want higher
taxes on the rich,

01:13:16.631 --> 01:13:17.931
Then you know,
put them to the side.

01:13:17.932 --> 01:13:19.362
They don't understand things.

01:13:19.366 --> 01:13:21.166
They're opposed to wars,

01:13:21.167 --> 01:13:23.367
It's 'cause they don't
understand how important it is

01:13:23.369 --> 01:13:26.369
For us to bomb Libya
and whatever it may be.

01:13:26.372 --> 01:13:28.410
It used to be in earlier times

01:13:28.411 --> 01:13:30.707
That you could use
force to do this,

01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:34.339
But by the early 20th century,

01:13:34.345 --> 01:13:36.345
Countries like England
and the United States,

01:13:36.347 --> 01:13:38.247
The more free societies,

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:41.848
It was recognized that force
was no longer sufficient,

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:44.921
So you had to turn the control
of attitudes and opinions.

01:13:44.922 --> 01:13:46.720
It's quite conscious
incidentally.

01:13:46.721 --> 01:13:48.521
I think manufacturing consent

01:13:48.522 --> 01:13:50.122
Is essentially the Rosetta stone

01:13:50.123 --> 01:13:52.793
For understanding the
hieroglyphics of the us media.

01:13:54.759 --> 01:13:57.059
It is the case that if you go

01:13:57.062 --> 01:14:00.431
To most media figures

01:14:00.432 --> 01:14:03.632
And/or to media corporations and
tell them that they're really...

01:14:03.635 --> 01:14:05.695
Constrain them of things
they can and can't say,

01:14:05.703 --> 01:14:07.303
And not only will they deny it,

01:14:07.304 --> 01:14:10.606
But they'll essentially
be truthful in their denial,

01:14:10.607 --> 01:14:12.207
In the sense that
they believe that denial,

01:14:12.208 --> 01:14:14.808
Because they don't have someone
standing over their shoulder

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:16.877
Deleting words that they write

01:14:16.878 --> 01:14:19.108
Or compelling them to say things
they don't want to say,

01:14:19.113 --> 01:14:21.983
But the entire system
breeds a certain orthodox.

01:14:21.984 --> 01:14:25.082
It breeds a certain
kind of range of pie-ties

01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:28.645
And if you deviate too far
from them, it will reject you.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.020
So, yes, you're perfectly free

01:14:32.023 --> 01:14:33.423
Once you accept the...

01:14:33.424 --> 01:14:35.892
You internally
accept the principles

01:14:35.893 --> 01:14:38.893
And you feel under
no pressure in censorship.

01:14:38.896 --> 01:14:40.626
You can say anything you want

01:14:40.631 --> 01:14:43.531
As long as you accept
the concept of objectivity.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.300
Ninety-nine percent of the
people who work in the business

01:14:47.303 --> 01:14:50.843
Just think they're doing their
jobs and they don't realize

01:14:50.844 --> 01:14:55.339
That they're creating
this kinda endless,

01:14:55.342 --> 01:14:57.180
You know, minefield of stupidity

01:14:57.181 --> 01:14:59.777
That it's gonna be impossible
for us to all breach

01:14:59.779 --> 01:15:01.749
When the time comes, you know.

01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:06.577
Those reporters who
care more about truth

01:15:06.584 --> 01:15:09.819
Will eventually become
management problems,

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.350
And the ones who can read power,

01:15:12.355 --> 01:15:14.585
In essence,
function as courtiers,

01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:18.020
Know how to play the game.

01:15:18.026 --> 01:15:21.586
The veneer of
objectivity, neutrality,

01:15:21.596 --> 01:15:25.156
Impartiality, truth, and yet,

01:15:25.165 --> 01:15:27.965
Assiduously serve,

01:15:27.967 --> 01:15:30.927
In essence, power,

01:15:30.936 --> 01:15:34.166
Are the ones who rise
within the institution,

01:15:34.172 --> 01:15:39.109
And that's why if you
look at the top management

01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:41.910
Of even institutions
like the new york times,

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:44.912
They're filled with such
incredible mediocrities.

01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:48.150
They can do exactly
what they want,

01:15:48.151 --> 01:15:50.779
But they wouldn't
be in that position

01:15:50.784 --> 01:15:53.784
Unless they already
accepted the framework.

01:15:54.786 --> 01:15:56.786
I.F. Stone is
a perfect example.

01:15:56.789 --> 01:15:59.759
He's a terrific reporter,
maybe one of the best,

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.858
But he didn't accept the rules,
so he was out of the system.

01:16:02.861 --> 01:16:05.161
Same with innumerable others.

01:16:05.163 --> 01:16:10.066
Jeremy Scahill, Glenn Greenwald,
Amy Goodman, even Matt Taibbi.

01:16:27.348 --> 01:16:31.018
From my reporting, these are all

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.990
The autopsies that were ordered.

01:16:32.991 --> 01:16:36.088
Is this a scientific
autopsy report from...

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.821
You're laughing.

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:42.556
This doesn't look like a report
that my students would do.

01:16:42.563 --> 01:16:44.830
The report doesn't
look like a...

01:16:44.831 --> 01:16:46.798
That even your
students would do, okay.

01:16:46.799 --> 01:16:48.059
You know,
I'm sort of getting at,

01:16:48.066 --> 01:16:49.526
Whether or not there
was some sort of a scam

01:16:49.534 --> 01:16:50.703
With the autopsies.

01:16:50.704 --> 01:16:52.501
All these reports are missing.

01:16:52.502 --> 01:16:54.771
Oh, those are the
missing ones, oh, okay.

01:16:54.772 --> 01:16:56.970
So, over 30% of the
autopsies ordered.

01:16:56.972 --> 01:16:58.541
You don't even have
a lab report for.

01:16:58.542 --> 01:17:01.170
We don't even know if
they were ever performed.

01:17:01.175 --> 01:17:02.005
They were billed.

01:17:02.009 --> 01:17:03.379
I have the canceled checks.

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.937
Oh.

01:17:04.945 --> 01:17:06.775
I just don't have if
the autopsy was performed,

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:08.010
What they found.

01:17:20.424 --> 01:17:23.593
You get appointed to the board
of one of these commissions,

01:17:23.594 --> 01:17:26.394
Essentially in Texas, by being
a large campaign contributor.

01:17:26.396 --> 01:17:29.956
This is all an expose
of this mass grave.

01:17:30.965 --> 01:17:34.425
Make these people own this shit.

01:17:34.435 --> 01:17:35.895
Make 'em own it,

01:17:35.903 --> 01:17:38.403
Because this is what
is existing in this state

01:17:38.405 --> 01:17:41.005
And it's those people
over at the capital,

01:17:41.007 --> 01:17:43.437
But it's also people who just
go about their daily lives

01:17:43.442 --> 01:17:44.542
And let it happen.

01:17:57.188 --> 01:17:59.788
He had to answer questions
for weeks about this.

01:17:59.790 --> 01:18:02.320
He also was pulled in
by some high ranking

01:18:02.325 --> 01:18:05.785
Local officials in the state and
asked very similar questions,

01:18:05.795 --> 01:18:07.185
So he's had time to prep.

01:18:07.196 --> 01:18:10.196
Basically, what happened
is nueces county

01:18:10.199 --> 01:18:13.199
Was providing autopsy
services for brooks county,

01:18:13.202 --> 01:18:17.202
And they were overwhelmed
with nueces county alone.

01:18:17.206 --> 01:18:19.066
Course I wasn't around when
all of this was being done,

01:18:19.074 --> 01:18:21.774
You know, we kind of picked
up after the fact, you know.

01:18:21.776 --> 01:18:23.736
Some of them were done

01:18:23.744 --> 01:18:25.844
During the time of
your tenure here too.

01:18:25.846 --> 01:18:27.676
Some of them were after 2007.

01:18:27.681 --> 01:18:28.681
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:18:28.682 --> 01:18:30.112
So, I'm just wondering

01:18:30.116 --> 01:18:31.876
Is that the mortuary
who's dumping bodies?

01:18:31.884 --> 01:18:33.284
Actually, well, we had...

01:18:33.285 --> 01:18:35.075
In other words,
who monitors the mortuary?

01:18:35.086 --> 01:18:36.946
They're an independent
contractor,

01:18:36.954 --> 01:18:38.154
So in other words,

01:18:38.155 --> 01:18:40.485
You contract somebody to do it,

01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:42.960
You pay 'em 750 bucks
and they go do the job.

01:18:42.961 --> 01:18:44.489
All we know is we're gonna pay

01:18:44.493 --> 01:18:47.328
For four...
$500, $500, $500...

01:18:47.329 --> 01:18:48.359
And it's gonna say,

01:18:48.363 --> 01:18:49.963
"one was Eddie Canalis,
he was identified."

01:18:49.964 --> 01:18:51.664
This gentlemen was john doe.

01:18:51.665 --> 01:18:53.395
"The other one was
another john doe."

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.700
In a case where
I was not comfortable

01:18:55.702 --> 01:18:58.170
With cause of death, DNA and...

01:18:58.171 --> 01:19:00.939
That's the criteria where
you saw something suspicious.

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.610
What if you found just bones
or a skull or something?

01:19:02.611 --> 01:19:04.468
It's... it's difficult.
You can't do that.

01:19:04.476 --> 01:19:05.836
It would be a waste of time.

01:19:05.844 --> 01:19:07.244
You would not order an autopsy

01:19:07.245 --> 01:19:08.905
If it was just a skull or bones.

01:19:08.913 --> 01:19:10.982
Once the sun,
108, 107 degrees...

01:19:10.983 --> 01:19:13.351
So, a sun bleached skull
or something, no?

01:19:13.352 --> 01:19:14.780
No, no, they wouldn't.

01:19:16.317 --> 01:19:17.477
You don't have a problem

01:19:17.485 --> 01:19:19.375
Until somebody makes
a problem out of it.

01:19:20.854 --> 01:19:23.154
The documents I have
and the evidence I have,

01:19:23.156 --> 01:19:25.016
I asked him directly
about those things

01:19:25.024 --> 01:19:26.361
And he lied through his teeth

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:28.318
Through every
single one of them.

01:19:28.326 --> 01:19:30.826
So, the way the bodies
were buried, the mortuaries,

01:19:30.828 --> 01:19:33.758
The contracts,
everything, he's just...

01:19:33.764 --> 01:19:35.364
Just bullshitting
me the whole way.

01:19:36.933 --> 01:19:38.733
In my investigation
prior to speaking to him,

01:19:38.734 --> 01:19:41.104
I have found nothing but
discrepancies in the paperwork

01:19:41.105 --> 01:19:44.073
And the documents in the
way that records were kept,

01:19:44.074 --> 01:19:46.472
And he basically,
without knowing he did,

01:19:46.474 --> 01:19:48.274
Admitted it all to me,

01:19:48.275 --> 01:19:51.475
And I'm actually just shaking
a little bit from it.

01:20:05.291 --> 01:20:07.861
The only way I'm able to
do the investigative work

01:20:07.862 --> 01:20:10.129
Before we even bring it
to a broadcast outlet,

01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:11.928
Before we bring it to
the mainstream media,

01:20:11.929 --> 01:20:13.859
Is because I actually
get paid every month

01:20:13.864 --> 01:20:15.034
By the nation institute.

01:20:15.035 --> 01:20:16.831
I have a monthly stipend,

01:20:16.832 --> 01:20:18.670
An investigative
stipend that allows me

01:20:18.671 --> 01:20:20.227
To put all these pieces together

01:20:20.235 --> 01:20:22.095
And I can spend
months on a story.

01:20:22.103 --> 01:20:23.872
I can spend a year on a story

01:20:23.873 --> 01:20:26.141
Before I even bring it
to a broadcast outlet.

01:20:27.372 --> 01:20:29.006
If the medical examiner

01:20:29.007 --> 01:20:32.907
Or the forensic person in
brooks county examined bones,

01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:36.240
He charged one flat fee, $1500,

01:20:36.246 --> 01:20:38.076
And there were
many bones examined.

01:20:38.081 --> 01:20:40.851
They might as well have been an
eight-year-old who wrote them.

01:20:40.852 --> 01:20:42.450
"I saw a man
lying on the ground,"

01:20:42.451 --> 01:20:43.781
His bones were scattered.

01:20:43.785 --> 01:20:46.345
They looked okay to me,"
is basically a report.

01:20:46.354 --> 01:20:48.121
Fifteen hundred bucks.

01:20:48.122 --> 01:20:52.792
He was judge for eight
years from 2007 to 2014.

01:20:54.359 --> 01:20:56.159
That's when all the
bodies were buried.

01:20:56.161 --> 01:20:59.131
We... we know that brooks county
is under-resourced

01:20:59.132 --> 01:21:02.160
And their record
keeping isn't great,

01:21:02.166 --> 01:21:05.166
And so let's just take that
at face value for now.

01:21:05.169 --> 01:21:06.769
I don't think it's so much that.

01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:08.240
I think there's
something going on here.

01:21:08.241 --> 01:21:09.338
Obviously.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:15.080
I think about I.F. Stone a lot
and I think about his phrase,

01:21:15.081 --> 01:21:16.707
"all governments lie."

01:21:16.711 --> 01:21:18.441
And I also think about the fact

01:21:18.446 --> 01:21:20.546
That most of his
reporting was done

01:21:20.548 --> 01:21:23.018
Putting his face in
a stack of documents.

01:21:23.916 --> 01:21:25.346
It wasn't flashy.

01:21:25.351 --> 01:21:28.886
He found the fact
that governments lie

01:21:28.887 --> 01:21:32.047
Basically by what
governments do.

01:21:32.056 --> 01:21:33.986
They're bad at
covering up their lies.

01:21:33.991 --> 01:21:35.360
I can take you to where I work

01:21:35.361 --> 01:21:37.059
And I can show you
stack after stack

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.460
After stack of documents

01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:41.031
And I find, in our own
government documents,

01:21:41.032 --> 01:21:42.730
Nothing but lies.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:45.099
Nothing but misrepresentation.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.768
Nothing but
covering up the truth.

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:49.599
And governments
do lie frequently,

01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:52.444
And it's my job to
find out when they lie.

01:22:15.562 --> 01:22:17.902
If you don't step back and
look at the bigger picture,

01:22:17.903 --> 01:22:21.757
Fundamentally, the empire
is not afraid of anyone really

01:22:21.766 --> 01:22:23.396
That's running for office.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.330
Whether it's the democrat
or the republican that wins,

01:22:26.336 --> 01:22:29.336
The core institutions
of that necessitate

01:22:29.339 --> 01:22:33.369
A brutal military force that
backs up the sort of, you know,

01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:35.635
Velvet-gloved hand
of the free market

01:22:35.643 --> 01:22:40.078
Is a given with every single
person that runs for office

01:22:40.079 --> 01:22:42.279
Or can get the nomination
of those parties.

01:22:42.281 --> 01:22:44.150
So, you know, even if
you have someone that,

01:22:44.151 --> 01:22:46.719
In the general election,
is perceived to be,

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.478
You know, crazy.

01:22:48.486 --> 01:22:51.116
Once they sort of start
getting those briefings

01:22:51.121 --> 01:22:52.721
From the permanent
power structure,

01:22:52.722 --> 01:22:53.891
The intelligence community,

01:22:53.892 --> 01:22:55.389
They all step into line.

01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:16.810
Well, in journalism school,

01:23:16.811 --> 01:23:18.679
You're taught to be objective,

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.337
And objective means

01:23:20.345 --> 01:23:25.305
Report accurately what's
going on within the beltway.

01:23:25.316 --> 01:23:28.316
So, inside the system of power.

01:23:28.319 --> 01:23:32.019
If you report that
accurately, you're objective.

01:23:32.022 --> 01:23:35.290
If you go outside that,
you're biased.

01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:37.458
Well, plenty of things outside

01:23:37.459 --> 01:23:40.789
That this is a narrow
concentrated power system.

01:23:40.795 --> 01:23:43.455
One of my favorite lines
from any film

01:23:43.464 --> 01:23:47.400
Is from the film
"the usual suspects."

01:23:47.401 --> 01:23:50.201
You know, Kevin spacey,
amazing as Kaiser Soze,

01:23:50.203 --> 01:23:52.437
But at the end of
the film, he says,

01:23:52.438 --> 01:23:54.168
"the greatest trick
the devil ever pulled..."

01:23:54.173 --> 01:23:57.942
The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled

01:23:57.943 --> 01:24:00.212
Was convincing the world
he didn't exist.

01:24:00.213 --> 01:24:02.541
"Was convincing the
world he didn't exist."

01:24:02.546 --> 01:24:04.546
You know, you've got
crazy people thinking

01:24:04.548 --> 01:24:06.148
That the department
of homeland security's

01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:08.049
Gonna put them in
a fema camp somewhere.

01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:09.380
You have other people thinking

01:24:09.384 --> 01:24:10.924
That Obama's gonna come
and take their guns.

01:24:10.925 --> 01:24:12.278
That's all a sideshow.

01:24:12.286 --> 01:24:13.986
That's all a total sideshow.

01:24:13.987 --> 01:24:15.387
The coup already happened

01:24:15.388 --> 01:24:17.388
And the most brilliant
part about it is

01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:19.460
None of these people
seem to realize it.

01:24:33.505 --> 01:24:36.805
I can draw a line
from I.F. Stone

01:24:36.808 --> 01:24:38.438
Directly to what I'm doing now.

01:24:38.442 --> 01:24:40.442
It makes me sad to
think that actually,

01:24:40.444 --> 01:24:44.612
He isn't with us and it
makes me really hope that...

01:24:44.613 --> 01:24:47.213
That the next I.F. Stone
or two or three or four

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:49.475
Or 400 are out there now,

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:51.252
Who might be watching this
right now, and thinking,

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.282
"you know, I can do this."

01:24:52.286 --> 01:24:53.646
Because you can do it.

01:24:53.654 --> 01:24:54.791
You know, you can do it.

01:24:54.792 --> 01:24:56.818
Especially if you...
again, do the work.

01:24:56.823 --> 01:25:01.023
Do the hard work, but realize
that sometimes the best stuff

01:25:01.026 --> 01:25:02.426
Is right there
in front of your nose,

01:25:02.427 --> 01:25:04.187
And you don't even know it.

01:25:19.109 --> 01:25:21.809
I've actually written
a book you might like better.

01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:25.340
It's nice to meet you.

01:25:25.346 --> 01:25:28.176
Funding is the key to great
investigative reporting.

01:25:28.182 --> 01:25:30.282
That doesn't really
have a time frame.

01:25:30.284 --> 01:25:33.019
It may take you months
to get a document

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.650
That may take you in many
different directions and so,

01:25:35.655 --> 01:25:39.515
For me, time is... is equal
to the amount of funding,

01:25:39.525 --> 01:25:41.155
And funding is equal
to the amount of time

01:25:41.159 --> 01:25:42.689
That I can spend on something.

01:25:42.693 --> 01:25:44.393
I'm working on
a project right now

01:25:44.394 --> 01:25:45.732
That I've been working
on for the past year

01:25:45.733 --> 01:25:47.228
And I probably will
take another year

01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:48.559
Before it's actually broadcast.

01:25:48.563 --> 01:25:51.363
If I were working
for corporate media,

01:25:51.365 --> 01:25:52.695
This story would never air.

01:25:52.699 --> 01:25:54.699
It just... I'd never
have that luxury

01:25:54.701 --> 01:25:57.201
Of being able to develop
a story for that length of time.

01:25:57.203 --> 01:25:59.773
As independent journalists,
I was wondering,

01:25:59.774 --> 01:26:02.772
What do you guys think
the implications are

01:26:02.775 --> 01:26:05.005
Of our news media being reduced

01:26:05.010 --> 01:26:07.510
To 140-character
sound bites?

01:26:07.512 --> 01:26:11.512
Twitter can play an incredible
role if used properly

01:26:11.515 --> 01:26:15.345
By journalists
in debunking myths

01:26:15.351 --> 01:26:16.617
Or misinformation.

01:26:16.618 --> 01:26:18.378
The flip side is also true,

01:26:18.386 --> 01:26:20.316
Which is that it can
spread misinformation

01:26:20.321 --> 01:26:22.689
Very, very quickly.

01:26:22.690 --> 01:26:25.660
I... I think that the future
is taking so much

01:26:25.661 --> 01:26:28.189
Of what's amazing
about the creativity

01:26:28.194 --> 01:26:29.894
And innovation of young people

01:26:29.895 --> 01:26:32.995
Who are dipping their toes
into the water of journalism

01:26:32.998 --> 01:26:36.068
And the ideas that they have,
and the lack of cynicism,

01:26:36.069 --> 01:26:40.937
And we try to meld that with
old school muckraking techniques

01:26:40.938 --> 01:26:42.668
And slow cooked journalism.

01:26:42.673 --> 01:26:46.442
Whoever figures out how to
really web those two things

01:26:46.443 --> 01:26:49.543
Is gonna create something very
special in the media landscape.

01:26:49.546 --> 01:26:52.246
Almost my entire life
as a journalist

01:26:52.248 --> 01:26:55.148
Has been spent in poverty media.

01:26:55.150 --> 01:26:57.219
You know, media outlets
that have no money,

01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:58.718
And we are professional beggars,

01:26:58.719 --> 01:27:01.389
And begging can
sometimes come in the form

01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:05.818
Of asking for funds
from... from a foundation

01:27:05.825 --> 01:27:09.125
Or it can come in the form
of writing a letter

01:27:09.128 --> 01:27:10.588
To your family
and friends, saying,

01:27:10.596 --> 01:27:12.926
"I really want to go
to Iraq to be a reporter.

01:27:12.931 --> 01:27:14.661
Can you kick in
25 or 50 bucks?"

01:27:14.666 --> 01:27:16.126
And that's actually
how I financed

01:27:16.134 --> 01:27:17.771
The first time
I ever went to Iraq,

01:27:17.772 --> 01:27:20.028
Was begging my extended
family to pitch in

01:27:20.036 --> 01:27:22.066
At $25 and $50.

01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:23.438
He's come a long way

01:27:23.439 --> 01:27:26.209
Since he was pretty much
the original volunteer

01:27:26.210 --> 01:27:27.308
At democracy now!

01:27:27.309 --> 01:27:28.679
Jeremy Scahill.

01:27:32.579 --> 01:27:35.779
The fact that I... I now have
received this designation

01:27:35.783 --> 01:27:37.416
Is a tremendous honor,

01:27:37.417 --> 01:27:41.086
And I want to pledge
to use this opportunity

01:27:41.087 --> 01:27:45.456
To educate a new generation
of young journalists

01:27:45.457 --> 01:27:49.026
About the incredibly
important work of I.F. Stone

01:27:49.027 --> 01:27:51.757
And the legacy that
he has left all of us

01:27:51.763 --> 01:27:54.763
And the challenge
that he has left us all

01:27:54.766 --> 01:27:59.096
In a very dark time
to simply be journalists.

01:27:59.103 --> 01:28:01.703
This isn't a career,
this isn't a profession.

01:28:01.705 --> 01:28:03.595
Journalism is a way of life.

01:28:05.474 --> 01:28:08.374
My hope is that we somehow
miraculously produce

01:28:08.376 --> 01:28:11.906
A generation of
young I.F. Stones.

01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:14.452
We need to stop keeping
up with the Kardashians

01:28:14.453 --> 01:28:17.947
And start going back and
catching up on I.F. Stone.

01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:19.650
Thank you very much.

01:28:21.519 --> 01:28:25.488
I think he's really
an inspiration in the role

01:28:25.489 --> 01:28:27.419
That media can play
in the world.

01:28:27.424 --> 01:28:29.864
I think the media can
be the greatest force

01:28:29.865 --> 01:28:31.589
For peace on earth.

01:28:31.594 --> 01:28:34.762
Instead it's wielded
as a weapon of war,

01:28:34.763 --> 01:28:36.763
And that has to be challenged.

01:28:37.831 --> 01:28:40.531
I.F. Stone taught us
governments lie,

01:28:40.534 --> 01:28:45.037
All governments lie,
especially in a time of war.

01:28:45.038 --> 01:28:48.807
When the media acts as
a conveyor belt for the lies,

01:28:48.808 --> 01:28:52.438
Why it matters is
because lies take lives

01:28:52.444 --> 01:28:56.546
And we see
the enormous devastation

01:28:56.547 --> 01:28:57.647
That came from that

01:28:57.648 --> 01:28:59.808
That we still live with today

01:28:59.816 --> 01:29:01.916
So many years later.

01:29:01.918 --> 01:29:05.848
That came from a media that
did not challenge the lies.

01:29:07.322 --> 01:29:08.852
Just because you're a journalist

01:29:08.856 --> 01:29:10.916
Doesn't mean you check
your humanity at the door.

01:29:10.924 --> 01:29:13.062
This is... you don't
somehow get some pass

01:29:13.063 --> 01:29:14.659
To not care about people.

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:17.530
Sometimes there is only
one way of seeing a story,

01:29:17.531 --> 01:29:19.259
And sometimes the
truth is just true.

01:29:26.837 --> 01:29:28.837
There's only two
types of reporters.

01:29:29.638 --> 01:29:31.906
There's those who care,

01:29:31.907 --> 01:29:33.837
And those who don't.

01:29:33.842 --> 01:29:37.642
Most of 'em don't care,
but if you care,

01:29:37.645 --> 01:29:40.545
If you are as I was
in El Salvador,

01:29:40.547 --> 01:29:43.647
Or Gaza or Sarajevo,

01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:47.580
Then you are immediately
branded as political,

01:29:47.586 --> 01:29:49.646
Because if you care,

01:29:49.654 --> 01:29:53.956
You can't lie to
cover up oppression,

01:29:53.957 --> 01:29:56.457
Atrocity, genocide.

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:01.530
And I.F. Stone cared.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:09.269
The Vietnam war has
been a terrible defeat

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.040
For all the brand
names we believe in.

01:30:11.041 --> 01:30:14.707
For general electric and
general motors and at&t.

01:30:14.708 --> 01:30:16.238
For all the great corporations,

01:30:16.242 --> 01:30:18.742
All the great industry
that do the push buttons,

01:30:18.744 --> 01:30:20.413
And when they...
when they turn to war,

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:22.681
They know how to
kill people en masse.

01:30:22.682 --> 01:30:24.410
And here, down in the jungle,

01:30:24.415 --> 01:30:26.615
Way below is this
strange creature

01:30:26.617 --> 01:30:28.617
That we can't crush.

01:30:28.619 --> 01:30:32.619
This strange animal
we can't kill.

01:30:32.623 --> 01:30:36.459
It's time to look closely
at it and see, by god,

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:39.060
It's a human being,
and isn't that wonderful

01:30:39.062 --> 01:30:41.562
That human beings can resist

01:30:41.564 --> 01:30:44.104
All this murderous
technology of ours?

01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:04.649
Very briefly and in no small
measure to remind ourselves,

01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:06.119
An observation by stone

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.618
And what he thought
journalism was all about.

01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:10.587
In his words,
to write the truth,

01:31:10.588 --> 01:31:12.118
To defend the weak
against the strong,

01:31:12.122 --> 01:31:15.262
To fight for justice,
to bring healing perspectives

01:31:15.263 --> 01:31:19.058
To bear on the terrible
hates and fears of mankind

01:31:19.061 --> 01:31:20.991
In the hope of someday
bringing about a world

01:31:20.996 --> 01:31:24.896
In which man will enjoy the
differences of the human garden

01:31:24.899 --> 01:31:27.729
Instead of killing
each other over them.

01:31:27.735 --> 01:31:29.325
If you look
you'll find much more.
