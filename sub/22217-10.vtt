WEBVTT

00:02.828 --> 00:03.961
I killed your father.

00:04.697 --> 00:06.931
(Iris screaming)

00:06.933 --> 00:08.766
I believe that you are willing
to do whatever it takes

00:08.768 --> 00:10.100
to put your past behind you.

00:10.102 --> 00:11.101
I just don't know that I am.

00:11.103 --> 00:12.603
I want you to get the help you need.

00:12.605 --> 00:14.086
What, like rehab?

00:14.121 --> 00:15.739
Yes, I will go.

00:16.779 --> 00:17.908
Mmm.

00:18.802 --> 00:19.684
What are you doing?

00:19.719 --> 00:20.984
Making my own choices.

00:21.019 --> 00:23.514
Diego Calastana,
I am sorry to keep you waiting.

00:23.549 --> 00:24.478
Blake Carrington,

00:24.513 --> 00:26.123
what a pleasure it is to meet you.

00:26.158 --> 00:28.586
Been looking forward to
this for quite some time.

00:31.456 --> 00:32.222
IRIS: No!

00:32.223 --> 00:34.525
(Alejandro shouting in Spanish)

00:34.527 --> 00:35.726
No!

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:47.607 --> 00:48.772
(door opens)

00:48.774 --> 00:50.140
Blake?

00:50.142 --> 00:52.760
I'm afraid not. Pardon the intrusion.

00:52.795 --> 00:55.632
Mr. Carrington needs
his racing cuff links.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.715
And he sent you to get them?

00:57.717 --> 00:59.483
I guess sleeping in separate wings

00:59.485 --> 01:00.885
isn't separate enough for him.

01:00.887 --> 01:02.386
A man needs his space.

01:02.388 --> 01:03.754
Especially after he discovers

01:03.756 --> 01:06.757
his wife's a congenital
liar and murderer.

01:07.374 --> 01:09.593
Do you want these
curtains drawn or open?

01:09.595 --> 01:11.328
You can leave them closed.

01:13.894 --> 01:15.199
(groans)

01:20.702 --> 01:23.136
Where's Blake and Steven?

01:23.138 --> 01:25.806
Daddy's avoiding you,
and Steven's avoiding Daddy,

01:25.808 --> 01:27.627
and life, for that matter.

01:27.710 --> 01:30.377
Don't touch that!
That's edible 24-karat leaf,

01:30.379 --> 01:33.013
so keep your gold-digging
paws off of it.

01:33.015 --> 01:35.081
It's a sample for my
birthday party tomorrow.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.350
The theme is "The Midas Touch,"

01:37.352 --> 01:39.252
since everything I touch turns to bank.

01:39.254 --> 01:41.488
Do you even know who Midas was?

01:41.490 --> 01:43.324
He destroyed his whole
family out of greed.

01:43.392 --> 01:45.292
Oh, God, Cristal, that's just a myth.

01:45.294 --> 01:47.527
The only one destroying
our family is you.

01:47.529 --> 01:49.996
But not even you can
spoil my special day,

01:49.998 --> 01:52.032
because not only am I turning 25,

01:52.034 --> 01:54.234
but I am finally getting
control of my trust.

01:54.236 --> 01:56.236
And thanks to your gripping
confession the other night,

01:56.238 --> 01:58.572
now the entire family knows
the truth about you...

01:58.574 --> 02:01.842
that you're a lying,
cheating stabber of men.

02:03.219 --> 02:05.912
This is shaping up to be
the best birthday yet.

02:05.914 --> 02:08.215
Maybe when I blow out my candles,
you'll be gone.

02:10.686 --> 02:12.385
So what's going on with Steven?

02:12.387 --> 02:13.854
I've barely seen him since New Year's.

02:14.718 --> 02:15.856
Are you talking to me?

02:15.858 --> 02:17.390
I would like to be.

02:18.851 --> 02:20.527
Steven's due at rehab today.

02:20.529 --> 02:23.029
After he tried to run off with Ted,

02:23.031 --> 02:24.431
Blake froze his accounts and said

02:24.433 --> 02:25.932
he wouldn't get a dime unless he goes.

02:25.934 --> 02:27.734
Oh, my God. I had no idea.

02:27.736 --> 02:30.737
That's what happens when you
screw over your entire family.

02:30.739 --> 02:32.272
I wish you'd let me explain.

02:32.274 --> 02:34.841
You did. You killed my father

02:34.843 --> 02:36.443
and let me believe he abandoned me.

02:36.445 --> 02:38.278
I was protecting your mom.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.713
He wasn't a good man.

02:39.715 --> 02:41.214
You lied to me for ten years.

02:41.216 --> 02:42.616
That your idea of being good?

02:42.618 --> 02:44.317
(phone vibrating)

02:44.319 --> 02:46.720
(sighs) I lost my appetite.

02:46.722 --> 02:48.221
Didn't think that was possible.

02:49.619 --> 02:51.925
ANDERS: Culhane will bring the car
'round shortly.

02:51.927 --> 02:53.527
This new rehab center

02:53.529 --> 02:55.729
is excellent... I vetted it myself.

02:55.731 --> 02:57.697
- Beachfront property?
- Of course.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.199
- Michelin-rated cuisine?
- Naturally.

02:59.201 --> 03:00.901
Filled with second-chance,
second-tier celebrities?

03:00.903 --> 03:02.235
Unquestionably.

03:02.237 --> 03:04.304
Great. Still doesn't
mean it's right for me.

03:04.306 --> 03:06.640
You've been despondent for weeks.

03:06.642 --> 03:09.596
Given your history,
it would be naive to think

03:09.631 --> 03:12.379
that you're not going
to revert to old habits.

03:12.381 --> 03:14.981
I've done rehab. I'm all for it.

03:14.983 --> 03:17.918
I just don't think my problem
right now is addiction.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.820
It's my father thinking
he can control my life.

03:20.822 --> 03:22.088
That's how he cares.

03:22.090 --> 03:23.256
Now who's being naive?

03:23.258 --> 03:24.824
You know as well as I do

03:24.826 --> 03:27.661
we can't force your hand on this.

03:27.663 --> 03:29.462
You have to make the decision.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.665
Where the hell is Culhane?

03:31.667 --> 03:33.333
He's been late every morning this week.

03:33.335 --> 03:35.335
I could have driven you myself by now.

03:40.175 --> 03:41.675
MONICA: <i>Don't go.</i>

03:41.677 --> 03:45.545
You know you'd rather give
me a ride than Fallon.

03:45.547 --> 03:48.081
- Well... another ride.
- Mm...

03:48.083 --> 03:50.116
I'm supposed to be driving Steven today,

03:50.118 --> 03:51.851
and I'm already late for work,
thanks to you.

03:51.853 --> 03:55.422
Fine. But there'll be more of
this waiting for you tonight

03:55.424 --> 03:57.157
- when you get home.
- Mm.

03:57.159 --> 03:59.626
I gotta go.

04:06.034 --> 04:07.734
You should watch out.

04:07.736 --> 04:09.135
You've been visiting so often,

04:09.137 --> 04:10.670
you'd think you'd know
the pattern by now.

04:10.672 --> 04:11.611
You sure know mine.

04:11.936 --> 04:13.473
I see you watching me from your window,

04:13.475 --> 04:14.674
tracking when I come and go.

04:14.676 --> 04:16.642
Oh, I'm just watching the sprinklers

04:16.644 --> 04:19.813
scare the pests away... deer, raccoon,

04:19.815 --> 04:22.115
skanks on their walks of shame.

04:22.117 --> 04:24.150
I'm sure it was shameful
when you walked it,

04:24.152 --> 04:26.052
but I actually respect Michael.

04:26.054 --> 04:28.088
Your mouth is saying respect,

04:28.090 --> 04:31.758
but your dress says 5:00 a.m.
stripper on a Wednesday.

04:37.299 --> 04:38.665
You'll learn.

04:38.667 --> 04:41.034
(crying out)

04:45.907 --> 04:48.274
You're still angry, I get it.

04:48.276 --> 04:50.410
I should have told you everything.

04:50.412 --> 04:53.346
But you can't ignore me forever.

04:53.348 --> 04:56.449
You're right, we need to move forward.

04:56.451 --> 04:58.318
For the good of the company.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.755
Especially with this Unido
Caracas Oil deal on the table.

05:01.757 --> 05:04.157
I read the proposal.

05:04.159 --> 05:06.259
Have you worked with them before?

05:08.430 --> 05:10.430
My father has, back in the day.

05:10.432 --> 05:12.232
They want to license
our refinery technology

05:12.234 --> 05:13.833
so they can make U.S.-grade gasoline.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.101
It could be a good partnership,

05:15.103 --> 05:16.409
but we haven't dealt
with them in a while.

05:16.438 --> 05:18.438
With everything that's
going on in Venezuela,

05:18.440 --> 05:19.839
are you sure this is a good idea?

05:19.841 --> 05:21.541
That's what I need you for.

05:22.711 --> 05:24.511
You speak the language.

05:24.513 --> 05:26.780
You know the political landscape
better than anyone on our team.

05:26.782 --> 05:28.715
So you do still trust me.

05:28.717 --> 05:30.016
Your professional instincts, yes.

05:30.018 --> 05:32.786
I'm on it.

05:32.788 --> 05:35.221
- Do you think now we could talk about us?
- (phone vibrating)

05:36.109 --> 05:37.557
I'm on my way in.

05:37.559 --> 05:40.627
No, I'm completely free.
Who's on my call sheet?

05:42.130 --> 05:44.197
JEFF: We just got through the holidays.

05:44.199 --> 05:46.299
- You planning your next vacation?
- I don't want to visit an island,

05:46.301 --> 05:47.701
I want to buy one.

05:47.703 --> 05:49.736
Now that I'm getting
control of my trust,

05:49.738 --> 05:52.372
I can reinvest the hundred
million the way I want,

05:52.374 --> 05:54.040
and buy myself a little birthday gift.

05:54.042 --> 05:55.375
JEFF: Looks kind of remote.

05:55.377 --> 05:56.776
Well, that's why I'm getting a yacht,

05:56.778 --> 05:57.911
to get to the island.

05:57.913 --> 06:00.180
And a helicopter to get to the yacht.

06:01.817 --> 06:03.750
You got it all figured out, don't you?

06:03.752 --> 06:05.985
- Mm-hmm.
- But I have a better idea

06:05.987 --> 06:07.821
of what you could do with your assets.

06:07.823 --> 06:09.022
Sit them on your face?

06:09.024 --> 06:10.827
- Invest in Morell Corp.
- What?

06:10.859 --> 06:13.526
The best way to raise more
capital for our company

06:13.528 --> 06:15.495
is to invest our own money.

06:15.497 --> 06:17.497
It projects confidence in our future.

06:17.499 --> 06:20.834
I put up all the funds so far
'cause you were rich,

06:20.836 --> 06:23.803
just not venture-capitalist-
baller rich.

06:24.410 --> 06:26.740
But now that you're joining the club,

06:26.742 --> 06:28.875
maybe it's time we were equal partners.

06:28.877 --> 06:30.110
- Well...
- Hmm?

06:30.112 --> 06:32.879
I'm not exactly a passive partner.

06:32.881 --> 06:36.449
Besides, I can't invest that
big of a chunk of my trust

06:36.451 --> 06:38.451
into one company, even if it's ours.

06:38.453 --> 06:40.353
I need to stay diversified.

06:40.355 --> 06:43.356
- That is the safer Carrington way.
- Mm-hmm.

06:43.358 --> 06:46.326
But you started this company
to blaze your own way.

06:46.328 --> 06:48.561
And I didn't go from
nothing to everything

06:48.563 --> 06:50.430
by playing it safe.

06:50.432 --> 06:53.800
That's why you and I are
the apex power couple.

06:54.369 --> 06:55.535
In the board room?

06:55.537 --> 06:57.370
(chuckling)

06:57.372 --> 06:59.339
Or on the board room table?

06:59.341 --> 07:01.107
Mmm... both.

07:01.109 --> 07:02.642
- (giggles)
- Mmm.

07:02.644 --> 07:05.712
I think it's time we
take our company and us

07:05.714 --> 07:07.647
to the next level.

07:07.649 --> 07:10.316
Maybe one day we'll
have our own dynasty.

07:12.854 --> 07:14.521
Oh...

07:16.057 --> 07:18.892
Mr. Calastana, with Unido Caracas.

07:18.893 --> 07:22.700
_

07:23.732 --> 07:25.899
- <i>Hola, Celia.</i>
- Alejandro.

07:30.130 --> 07:32.347
_

07:34.547 --> 07:36.187
_

07:39.481 --> 07:41.047
Would you rather I talk like you?

07:41.049 --> 07:44.851
Or do words not matter
if spoken by a ghost?

07:46.087 --> 07:47.387
When you left me for dead,

07:47.389 --> 07:48.855
I'm sure you thought
that was the end of me.

07:48.857 --> 07:49.956
What are you doing here?

07:49.958 --> 07:52.792
I've been looking for
you for a long time.

07:54.062 --> 07:56.729
And then, a miracle.

07:57.666 --> 07:59.253
I saw your face on the news.

07:59.268 --> 08:02.001
An ordinary Venezuelan girl,
Cristal Flores,

08:02.003 --> 08:04.771
engaged to billionaire Blake Carrington.

08:04.773 --> 08:07.340
I realized I was thinking too small,

08:07.342 --> 08:10.276
chasing after you and
your sister for revenge.

08:10.278 --> 08:14.581
No, you coming back into my life...

08:14.583 --> 08:16.516
was an opportunity.

08:16.518 --> 08:18.251
The people I work for in Venezuela now

08:18.253 --> 08:20.220
have powerful ties in government,

08:20.222 --> 08:21.526
commerce, energy.

08:21.623 --> 08:24.190
You see, like you,
I've reinvented myself.

08:24.192 --> 08:27.126
Your new suit doesn't fool me.

08:27.128 --> 08:30.296
You're just a well-dressed tarantula.

08:30.298 --> 08:31.698
A criminal, like your bosses.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.131
Blake would never do business with you.

08:33.134 --> 08:36.001
There,<i> mi querida,</i> is where you come in.

08:37.979 --> 08:40.440
That's Davis, our senior counsel.

08:40.442 --> 08:42.976
Living evidence of this company's sins.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.978
Your husband's father
used him to pay bribes

08:44.980 --> 08:48.248
to government officials in
Caracas back in the day.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.383
And all this, thanks to your sister.

08:50.385 --> 08:51.951
What?

08:51.953 --> 08:53.286
Iris is a part of this?

08:53.288 --> 08:56.017
She found the contact for
Davis when she stayed with you.

08:57.148 --> 08:59.959
Get Blake to sign the deal,

08:59.961 --> 09:01.261
and I'll let Davis go.

09:02.066 --> 09:03.229
If you don't,

09:03.849 --> 09:05.565
your husband ends up in prison

09:05.567 --> 09:07.967
and you... what is the phrase...

09:07.968 --> 09:09.940
_

09:10.449 --> 09:12.180
_

09:13.074 --> 09:16.209
Except I won't make the mistake you did.

09:20.664 --> 09:21.814
I'll stay with you...

09:23.785 --> 09:25.885
...until your very last breath.

09:34.983 --> 09:37.923
Any real housewife can
serve magnums of champagne.

09:37.985 --> 09:40.719
I want the jeroboam or the Salmanazar.

09:40.721 --> 09:42.821
And they'll be poured by...

09:44.247 --> 09:46.892
Okay.
Just make sure it's hypoallergenic.

09:46.894 --> 09:48.126
I can't have them breaking out in a rash

09:48.128 --> 09:50.729
like the last one... so mortal.

09:50.731 --> 09:52.898
(sighs)

09:55.214 --> 09:56.447
What happened to you?

09:56.482 --> 09:58.670
Shia LaBeouf double-book
your room at rehab?

09:58.672 --> 10:00.238
I couldn't miss your
Lady Goldfinger party

10:00.240 --> 10:02.140
and the 24-karat boy toys.

10:02.142 --> 10:04.076
That's a fitting way to celebrate

10:04.078 --> 10:05.344
coming into your money.

10:05.346 --> 10:06.545
Well, I've wanted control of my trust

10:06.547 --> 10:07.846
ever since I found out

10:07.848 --> 10:09.314
what private equity investments were.

10:09.316 --> 10:11.016
- You were seven.
- Exactly.

10:11.018 --> 10:12.985
While other girls were crushing
on Chad Michael Murray,

10:12.987 --> 10:15.320
I was fantasizing about
rebalancing my portfolio.

10:15.322 --> 10:17.489
And I had a solid plan
until this morning.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.057
So, what changed?

10:20.164 --> 10:23.028
Jeff wants me to invest
my trust in Morell Corp.

10:23.030 --> 10:26.098
Your business instincts
are usually right.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.133
Unless we're not just talking
about business anymore.

10:28.135 --> 10:31.236
With Jeff, there is no line
between our company and us.

10:31.238 --> 10:33.105
And he wants to invest big in both.

10:33.107 --> 10:34.639
But what if us doesn't work out?

10:34.641 --> 10:36.475
I mean, I'm not exactly a
relationship kind of gal.

10:36.477 --> 10:38.377
True. You've also never tried.

10:38.379 --> 10:39.778
We're children of divorce, Steven.

10:39.780 --> 10:41.580
Every relationship I know is garbage.

10:41.582 --> 10:44.049
Dad and Cristal, Monica and Culhane,

10:44.051 --> 10:45.517
you and Cokehead-y Teddy.

10:46.286 --> 10:48.687
I'm sorry. How is Ted doing?

10:48.689 --> 10:50.722
Since Dad had him arrested?

10:50.724 --> 10:52.958
I bailed him out,
but he's ignoring my calls.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.393
- Can't really blame him.
- Well,

10:54.395 --> 10:56.161
I'm glad you'll be here for my birthday.

10:56.163 --> 10:57.763
But are you sure you're okay?

10:57.765 --> 10:59.931
I mean, I don't want you
snorting icing off my cake.

10:59.933 --> 11:00.999
I'm fine.

11:01.001 --> 11:02.634
I know Dad's pissed about it,

11:02.636 --> 11:05.170
but what's wrong with me can't
be cured by a 12-step program.

11:05.172 --> 11:07.305
Well, moping around here
isn't gonna fix it, either.

11:07.307 --> 11:09.841
You need to think of
yourself as a corporation.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.943
Without a mandate and clear goals,

11:11.945 --> 11:14.146
the entire company stagnates.

11:14.148 --> 11:15.580
You need to find the root cause

11:15.582 --> 11:17.783
and implement a corrective strategy.

11:17.785 --> 11:20.318
Right.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.987
You're scary, but I love you.

13:49.303 --> 13:51.703
I didn't come to steal the crumbs

13:51.705 --> 13:52.938
from the Carrington table.

13:52.940 --> 13:54.506
You knew Alejandro was alive.

You're helping him to extort Blake.

13:57.477 --> 13:58.843
back into our lives?

You're talking about my
husband and Sammy Jo's father.

14:01.248 --> 14:03.515
He hurt you, or did you forget?

14:03.517 --> 14:04.716
That was a long time ago.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.618
He still loves me.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.653
He wants us to be a family.
Sam and I are...

14:08.655 --> 14:11.356
Are you listening to yourself?

14:11.358 --> 14:14.192
Look, you can still get out of this.

14:14.194 --> 14:15.927
I just need to get you and Sam safe

14:15.929 --> 14:17.629
before I call the police,
but we can stop him.

14:17.631 --> 14:20.398
I didn't come here for your help. Okay?

14:20.400 --> 14:23.134
I came to tell you to
do what Alejandro says

14:23.136 --> 14:25.904
or you will lose this big,
beautiful house

14:25.906 --> 14:28.273
and your rich, handsome husband.

14:29.376 --> 14:31.843
Whose only flaw was marrying you.

14:31.845 --> 14:34.212
You betrayed me for someone
who almost killed you?

14:34.214 --> 14:36.982
He made mistakes. So did I.

14:36.984 --> 14:40.218
But I never asked you to hurt him,
to tear my family apart.

14:40.220 --> 14:43.154
- I saved you.
- No, you saved yourself.

14:43.156 --> 14:46.191
And ever since then,
when I wanted to come here

14:46.193 --> 14:49.060
and have a taste of the life you had,

14:49.062 --> 14:51.429

pawnshops are a part of life.

doorway to opportunity,

bike for Coachella tickets.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.226
Well, I hope so.

19:30.228 --> 19:32.361
I mean,
it's not all narcissistic vanity.

19:32.363 --> 19:34.030
Lots of top bankers and tycoons

19:34.032 --> 19:35.723
throw themselves ridiculous
parties all the time.

19:35.758 --> 19:36.599
You know why?

19:36.601 --> 19:38.234
Because one in five are psychopaths?

19:38.236 --> 19:40.369
Or because spending money

19:40.371 --> 19:42.171
distracts them from
deeper personal issues?

19:42.173 --> 19:44.340
Wealth shaming is for the working class,

19:44.342 --> 19:46.542
and they're not on the guest list,
except for you.

19:47.184 --> 19:48.310
Okay, a little to the right.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.679
No, no, no, right. Right.

19:50.681 --> 19:53.449
Right, like the hand you grab
your discount beers with.

19:53.451 --> 19:55.885
Fallon, what is going on with you?

19:56.871 --> 19:58.921
Monica told me you drenched
her with the sprinkler.

19:58.923 --> 20:00.556
Well, I figured
after you were done with her,

20:00.558 --> 20:01.891
she needed a shower.

20:01.893 --> 20:04.393
I'm surprised you found
time to be jealous,

20:04.395 --> 20:06.162
considering how busy
you've been with Jeff.

20:07.326 --> 20:09.799
Monica told me. How's that going?

20:10.564 --> 20:13.536
Well, it started as
late-night workplace grab-ass,

20:13.538 --> 20:15.738
- which is, you know, my comfort zone.
- I'm familiar.

20:15.740 --> 20:17.473
Then I agreed to take
it to the next level,

20:17.475 --> 20:18.741
and now it's starting
to feel a lot like...

20:18.743 --> 20:20.876
- Commitment.
- Ugh.

20:20.878 --> 20:22.311
The real "C" word.

20:22.313 --> 20:23.913
(laughs)

20:23.915 --> 20:26.048
Look, it's none of my business,

20:26.050 --> 20:28.117
but maybe he could be good for you.

20:29.063 --> 20:32.555
Yeah, maybe what you need is
someone who's at your level.

20:33.878 --> 20:36.392
There's not a lot of guys like that.

20:36.394 --> 20:37.893
Now, you two have done
good with your company.

20:37.895 --> 20:40.863
Just a couple of months ago,
you were struggling to stay afloat.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.398
Now you're taking things international

20:42.400 --> 20:44.033
and making deals with Venezuela.

20:45.903 --> 20:48.804
You two make a good team.

20:48.806 --> 20:52.174
What deals with Venezuela?

20:52.176 --> 20:53.442
The terms are good.

20:53.444 --> 20:55.211
I don't understand why Unido Caracas

20:55.213 --> 20:57.346
has to pay us through
these smaller subsidiaries.

20:57.348 --> 20:59.115
It makes it harder to account
where the money's coming from.

20:59.117 --> 21:01.350
Our corporation has a
complex family structure,

21:01.352 --> 21:03.919
but I assure you,
these are companies in good standing.

21:03.921 --> 21:06.689
Well, I need more than your assurances.

21:06.691 --> 21:09.391
I reached out to my
contacts in Venezuela

21:09.393 --> 21:11.760
and vetted every subsidiary
on the list with the FTC.

21:11.762 --> 21:13.195
They check out.

21:13.197 --> 21:14.563
We should do this.

21:16.134 --> 21:17.600
We'll need an answer soon.

21:17.602 --> 21:20.069
If not, there are other bids
we can consider.

21:22.607 --> 21:24.807
Well, if Cristal's done due diligence,

21:24.809 --> 21:26.742
I don't see any reason we
shouldn't move forward.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.477
I'll have the contracts drawn up.

21:28.479 --> 21:30.146
They'll be ready first
thing in the morning.

21:30.148 --> 21:31.780
- Perfect.
- BLAKE: Oh, no.

21:31.782 --> 21:32.982
I have a meeting in the mayor's office.

21:32.984 --> 21:34.150
Those things always run long.

21:34.152 --> 21:35.918
Come by the house tomorrow night.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.226
Well, tomorrow night's
Fallon's birthday party.

21:38.289 --> 21:40.990
This won't take long. We'll sign papers
and then raise a glass.

21:41.806 --> 21:45.161
To welcome Unido Caracas into
the Carrington Atlantic family.

21:45.997 --> 21:48.030
I feel like family already.

21:51.335 --> 21:52.902
I got your message.

21:52.904 --> 21:54.737
What's so important we
had to meet right now?

21:54.739 --> 21:56.739
Why didn't you tell me
about Unido Caracas?

21:56.741 --> 21:58.941
And why am I hearing
about it from Culhane,

21:58.943 --> 22:00.609
who heard about it from your sister?

22:00.611 --> 22:02.444
That's why you're so worked up?

22:02.446 --> 22:04.580
What other side deals are
you not telling me about?

22:04.582 --> 22:06.815
After our whole talk about us, and me

22:06.817 --> 22:08.717
sinking my trust into our company?

22:09.554 --> 22:10.886
You done?

22:11.886 --> 22:15.024
I look for business
opportunities all the time.

22:15.026 --> 22:16.959
I only tell you about
the ones with potential.

22:16.961 --> 22:20.172
When I heard Unido Caracas was in town,
I thought we could meet,

22:20.207 --> 22:23.399
explore Morell Corp.
bringing green energy to Venezuela.

22:23.401 --> 22:27.369
But after looking into it,
I realized it was a nonstarter.

22:27.371 --> 22:29.669
Unido was founded by Bolichicos.

22:29.704 --> 22:31.274
Mafia men, basically.

22:31.309 --> 22:34.677
And they have this sketchy contract
with the Venezuelan government.

22:34.679 --> 22:36.745
Whole thing couldn't be more corrupt.

22:38.216 --> 22:40.249
And they're closing a deal
with Carrington Atlantic.

22:41.553 --> 22:42.524
What?

22:42.991 --> 22:44.220
Bad news for Blake.

22:44.222 --> 22:45.888
Unless he knows what he's getting into.

22:47.058 --> 22:48.958
I'm sorry, Jeff.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.627
- I shouldn't have assumed...
- That I'd let you down somehow?

22:52.421 --> 22:53.796
And now I've let you down.

22:53.798 --> 22:57.399
I just think you're so afraid
of being in a relationship,

22:57.401 --> 22:59.768
you'll look for any
excuse to blow it up.

22:59.770 --> 23:01.804
When you should be investing in it.

23:01.806 --> 23:03.405
Like this company.

23:07.712 --> 23:09.878
(dog barking in distance)

23:09.880 --> 23:11.280
MAN: Yeah, go ahead.

23:11.282 --> 23:13.444
Okay, this is crazy.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.484
I admit, I came along
because I was worried

23:15.486 --> 23:17.152
you were going on another bender.

23:17.154 --> 23:20.289
I won't let you blow your
money on coke or meth

23:20.291 --> 23:21.790
or moon rocks.

23:21.792 --> 23:23.993
Which sounds fun,
but it's just another word for molly.

23:25.056 --> 23:26.028
That's her.

23:27.235 --> 23:30.299
- That's your drug dealer?
- She's not a dealer.

23:31.554 --> 23:33.135
That's Dominic Ortega's wife.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.372
So she's the beard of
one of your hookups?

23:37.409 --> 23:39.842
Dominic was a Carrington
Atlantic employee

23:39.844 --> 23:41.610
who died in a pipeline accident.

23:43.351 --> 23:45.914
Because I signed off
on a faulty inspection.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.651
- Oh, my God.
- Ever since I found out,

23:48.653 --> 23:49.952
the guilt has just been...

23:50.849 --> 23:51.854
I felt paralyzed.

23:51.856 --> 23:53.789
Like I couldn't do anything about it.

23:56.761 --> 23:58.093
But I can.

23:58.095 --> 24:01.297
If I hadn't already slept with you,
I totally would right now.

24:01.299 --> 24:03.132
(laughs softly)

24:03.134 --> 24:06.635
It's my way of saying this is a
really good thing you're doing.

24:15.479 --> 24:18.747
♪ ♪

24:28.083 --> 24:29.482
Shouldn't you be getting
ready for your party?

24:29.484 --> 24:31.017
Shouldn't you have
fired your wife by now?

24:31.019 --> 24:33.052
Or divorced your COO?
You take your pick.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.054
- This is not the time.
- It's been almost two weeks

24:35.056 --> 24:37.690
since Cristal confessed that
her entire identity is a lie,

24:37.692 --> 24:39.792
and, oh, yeah,
she knifed a dude to death.

24:39.794 --> 24:41.060
The only reason she confessed is because

24:41.062 --> 24:43.229
her sister would have
ratted her out anyway.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.364
Who knows what else
she's keeping from you?

24:44.366 --> 24:45.765
Why is this coming out now?

24:45.767 --> 24:47.467
You are closing a deal
with Unido Caracas,

24:47.469 --> 24:49.902
which is essentially run
by a Venezuelan Mafia.

24:49.904 --> 24:52.562
Doing business with them
could sink Carrington Atlantic

24:52.597 --> 24:53.640
and you.

24:54.876 --> 24:56.943
It only took Jeff one
day to find this out.

24:56.945 --> 24:58.544
Cristal's your COO.

24:58.546 --> 25:00.480
The question is, why didn't she?

25:14.929 --> 25:17.497
(laughs softly) What?
I couldn't help myself.

25:17.499 --> 25:19.699
He looked all ripped and shiny.

25:19.701 --> 25:20.967
I get it.

25:20.969 --> 25:23.903
Think I saw my reflection in his abs.

25:23.905 --> 25:26.272
Thanks for coming last night.
Meant a lot.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.408
You're not missing that 20 grand,
just a little bit?

25:29.182 --> 25:31.177
I am.

25:31.179 --> 25:34.147
In the pawnshop, I was thinking
about how easy it would be

25:34.149 --> 25:36.482
to blow that money on a lost weekend,

25:36.484 --> 25:38.985
flights to New York, a few eight-balls.

25:38.987 --> 25:40.753
I'm glad you didn't.

25:40.755 --> 25:42.288
Thanks to you.

25:46.361 --> 25:49.262
What you said about the
sacrifices your mother made

25:49.264 --> 25:50.663
to put food on the table.

25:50.665 --> 25:53.232
I was thinking: she was a widow.

25:53.234 --> 25:55.134
Just like Ortega's wife.

25:55.136 --> 25:56.969
Imagine if those kids had your appetite.

25:57.781 --> 25:59.472
You may have to pawn more watches.

26:01.443 --> 26:03.576
What's screwed up is
I used to blame my mom

26:03.578 --> 26:05.211
for my dad leaving us.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.647
Learning your aunt killed him

26:07.649 --> 26:09.716
isn't much of an improvement.

26:10.499 --> 26:12.218
Yeah. Right.

26:12.220 --> 26:14.387
Maybe if I had a stable family,
I wouldn't

26:14.389 --> 26:16.856
feel the need to lick gold
paint off a stranger's pecs.

26:17.889 --> 26:20.493

CRISTAL: We've been looking for you.
Mr. Calastana is here.

28:07.268 --> 28:08.701
I have the contracts. Copies were sent

28:08.703 --> 28:11.237
to your lawyers earlier.
I trust everything is in order?

28:11.239 --> 28:13.406
Not a damn thing about
this situation is in order.

28:14.020 --> 28:14.807
What are you doing?

28:14.809 --> 28:17.473
Some interesting details
about Unido Caracas

28:17.508 --> 28:18.628
have come to my attention.

28:18.663 --> 28:19.679
Ties to organized crime,

28:19.681 --> 28:20.880
corruption, money laundering?

28:20.882 --> 28:22.248
That's completely crazy.

28:22.250 --> 28:25.251
So I did some digging
into Diego Calastana.

28:27.662 --> 28:28.521
I know who he is.

28:28.523 --> 28:29.422
Blake, I can explain.

28:29.424 --> 28:31.724
You're Alejandro Raya.

28:31.726 --> 28:34.427
And my wife claims that she killed you,
but here you are, alive and well.

28:34.429 --> 28:35.828
And trying to extort me.

28:35.830 --> 28:38.764
What is this, a Machado family
conspiracy to take me down?

28:38.766 --> 28:39.866
It's not what it looks like.

28:39.868 --> 28:41.367
I didn't tell you to protect you.

28:41.369 --> 28:43.169
How much of a fool do you think I am?
People warned me

28:43.171 --> 28:44.604
that you were using me,
that you were just after my money,

28:44.606 --> 28:46.672
but I ignored them.

28:46.674 --> 28:49.108
And then you made me
believe that you loved me.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.512
And the whole time,
you were just whoring yourself out.

28:52.514 --> 28:55.014
- You don't mean that.
- You're right.

28:55.016 --> 28:56.916
At least a whore gives
you your money's worth.

28:58.140 --> 28:58.885
ALEJANDRO: Mr. Carrington,

28:58.887 --> 29:00.386
I understand your anger,

29:00.388 --> 29:02.755
but right now you need to
think about saving yourself.

29:02.757 --> 29:03.890
What are you talking about?

29:03.892 --> 29:05.458
We have your senior counsel, Davis.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.761
He is ready to testify that
Carrington Atlantic paid bribes

29:08.763 --> 29:11.230
to a foreign government
at your father's bidding.

29:11.232 --> 29:12.999
It's true.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.534
ALEJANDRO: Sign the deal,
and I'll let Davis go.

29:15.224 --> 29:18.604
Don't, and I will sink you
and everything you've built.

29:18.606 --> 29:22.074
You come into my house,
and you use my own wife against me,

29:22.076 --> 29:23.209
and you threaten me? I will...

29:23.211 --> 29:24.610
Blake, don't! (screams)

29:25.280 --> 29:26.546
- (people gasping)
- Hey!

29:26.548 --> 29:28.781
- Get out of my way.
- No. I won't let you hurt my father.

29:28.783 --> 29:30.783
Of course, you're in on this, too.

29:30.785 --> 29:31.751
Don't bother, Daddy.

29:31.753 --> 29:33.452
I already called security.

29:33.454 --> 29:36.322
You were right. I've let Cristal
and her family of snakes

29:36.324 --> 29:37.857
get away with too much for too long.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.859
- Blake, I'm warning you...
- I am warning you.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.694
You call your associates,
and you tell them

29:41.696 --> 29:44.063
to come at me with Davis or
whatever you think you've got.

29:44.065 --> 29:45.932
You take your best shot,
because I'm gonna rain hellfire
