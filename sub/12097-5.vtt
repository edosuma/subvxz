00:03.069 --> 00:06.071
<i>In last week's episode of</i> Soap,
<i>Chester had a plan.</i>

00:06.072 --> 00:08.073
<i>To keep from being lonely</i>
<i>in the basement,</i>

00:08.074 --> 00:10.576
<i>he made friends with a pet rat</i>
<i>named Arnold.</i>

00:10.577 --> 00:12.578
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

00:12.579 --> 00:14.079
<i>Benson didn't know he was a pet.</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:15.581
<i>This ruined Chester's plan...</i>

00:15.582 --> 00:18.083
<i>not to mention any plans</i>
<i>Arnold might have had.</i>

00:18.084 --> 00:19.585
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

00:19.586 --> 00:21.587
<i>Burt told Danny a plan</i>
<i>to help him change Elaine.</i>

00:21.588 --> 00:24.089
<i>And Carol told Jody her plan</i>
<i>to keep the baby.</i>

00:24.090 --> 00:25.591
<i>Tim and Corinne's plan</i>
<i>for their wedding night</i>

00:25.592 --> 00:27.092
<i>was interrupted</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:30.596
<i>by a call from Tim's mother</i>
<i>saying she was dying.</i>

00:30.597 --> 00:32.097
<i>Tim, who was sure</i>
<i>she was faking,</i>

00:32.098 --> 00:34.600
<i>decided to go to her</i>
<i>immediately...</i>

00:34.601 --> 00:36.101
<i>or by the weekend,</i>
<i>at the latest.</i>

00:36.102 --> 00:37.603
<i>Dutch had to go on the run,</i>

00:37.604 --> 00:39.104
<i>but planned to return</i>
<i>to see Eunice.</i>

00:39.105 --> 00:40.606
<i>And Chester,</i>

00:40.607 --> 00:43.108
<i>although he hadn't planned</i>
<i>anything of the kind,</i>

00:43.109 --> 00:45.110
<i>had an attack</i>
<i>and was rushed to the hospital.</i>

00:45.111 --> 00:46.612
<i>Confused?</i>

00:46.613 --> 00:47.613
<i>You won't be</i>

00:47.614 --> 00:50.116
<i>after this week's episode</i>
<i>of</i> Soap.

00:53.119 --> 00:56.121
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of two sisters,</i>

00:56.122 --> 00:58.123
<i>Jessica Tate...</i>

00:58.124 --> 01:00.626
<i>and Mary Campbell.</i>

01:00.627 --> 01:02.629
<i>These are the Tates.</i>

01:04.129 --> 01:06.632
<i>And these are the Campbells.</i>

01:08.134 --> 01:10.636
<i>And this is...</i> Soap.

01:37.664 --> 01:40.666
At approximately 9:05,

01:40.667 --> 01:42.167
the doorbell rang, then what?

01:42.168 --> 01:43.669
Then what?

01:43.670 --> 01:44.670
I told you.

01:44.671 --> 01:45.671
Tell us again.

01:45.672 --> 01:46.672
Tell us again.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.173
I went to the door.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.675
I opened it.

01:49.676 --> 01:52.177
I discovered Mr. Tate
on the doorstep, unconscious.

01:52.178 --> 01:53.178
I don't know how much longer

01:53.179 --> 01:55.180
I can stand this waiting.

01:55.181 --> 01:56.181
Don't worry, Mother,

01:56.182 --> 01:57.182
I'm sure we're gonna hear soon.

01:57.183 --> 01:58.684
You'd think they'd have

01:58.685 --> 02:00.185
a pinball machine
or something around here.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.187
Billy...

02:02.188 --> 02:03.689
Hey, a person can be sad

02:03.690 --> 02:05.190
and still play pinball
at the same time.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.192
Mrs. Tate.

02:07.193 --> 02:09.193
Mrs. Tate, your husband
is still in a coma.

02:09.195 --> 02:10.696
Oh...

02:10.697 --> 02:13.198
And we won't have the tests back
for at least 24 hours.

02:13.199 --> 02:14.199
Oh, the poor, dear man.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.201
And you can't do
anything until then?

02:16.202 --> 02:17.703
Well, I'm afraid
my hands are tied...

02:17.704 --> 02:21.206
But there is someone here
who just might be able to help.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.709
It's this lad right over here.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.210
Me?

02:25.211 --> 02:26.211
I don't understand.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.713
Well, you see, Mrs. Tate,

02:27.714 --> 02:29.715
there's still very little
we know about the power of love.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.216
Just a few minutes ago,

02:31.217 --> 02:32.718
your husband
spoke his son's name

02:32.719 --> 02:34.720
and seemed
to draw strength from it,

02:34.721 --> 02:36.722
and I feel
if we brought this boy

02:36.723 --> 02:38.223
to his father's bedside,

02:38.224 --> 02:40.726
he just might mean
the difference

02:40.727 --> 02:42.728
between life and death.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.229
Well, yes.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.231
Certainly, by all means.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.733
You must be quite a human being

02:47.734 --> 02:49.735
to have touched
another person so deeply.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.237
Thank you, sir.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.739
This way, Arnold.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.243
Um, doctor!

02:58.244 --> 02:59.745
Doctor, I believe there's been

02:59.746 --> 03:00.746
a slight misunderstanding.

03:00.747 --> 03:04.249
This is Billy.
This isn't Arnold.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.751
Oh.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.753
Arnold was a rat.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.755
Well, personality aside,

03:09.756 --> 03:11.256
I still feel
if we can locate this Arnold

03:11.257 --> 03:12.758
and bring him to Mr. Tate...

03:12.759 --> 03:14.259
No, no, that's not
possible, Doctor.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.761
Benson killed Arnold.

03:15.762 --> 03:16.762
All right!

03:16.763 --> 03:18.764
Come on, buddy,
hands flat on the wall!

03:18.765 --> 03:20.265
I had him pegged from the start.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.267
There was something
about his eyes.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.769
And, of course,
the color of my skin

03:23.770 --> 03:26.272
has got nothing to do with it.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.775
Stop that.
Arnold was a real rat.

03:29.776 --> 03:30.776
A pet rat.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.277
A rodent.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.779
I killed him with a broom.

03:33.780 --> 03:34.780
Oh.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.282
I still don't like
those eyes of his.

03:37.283 --> 03:38.283
That's nothing.

03:38.284 --> 03:41.787
I don't like your entire body.

03:41.788 --> 03:42.788
Look, Mrs. Tate,

03:42.789 --> 03:44.790
why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

03:44.791 --> 03:45.791
I'll call you

03:45.792 --> 03:47.292
as soon as I get
the reports back.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.293
Thank you, Doctor.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.294
Sure.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.796
Uh, when you came upon Mr. Tate,

03:50.797 --> 03:53.298
did any of you see this man
lurking in the area?

03:53.299 --> 03:56.301
Goes by the name of Dutch.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.302
No. No.
No, no. Uh-uh.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.303
Thank you.
No!

03:58.304 --> 04:00.305
Just routine.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.306
Wait a minute.

04:01.307 --> 04:02.808
Let me see that picture.

04:02.809 --> 04:06.311
Why, I've seen this man.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.312
You have?

04:07.313 --> 04:08.814
Of course.

04:08.815 --> 04:11.818
It's Benito Mussolini, you boob.

04:13.820 --> 04:14.821
Thank you.

04:15.822 --> 04:16.822
Uh, Officer?

04:16.822 --> 04:18.824
Do you think I might have that?

04:18.825 --> 04:20.325
Just in case I see
somebody suspicious

04:20.326 --> 04:21.326
in the neighborhood?

04:21.327 --> 04:22.327
Okay, sure, but be careful.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.829
He's considered dangerous.

04:23.830 --> 04:24.830
Thank you.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.832
I'll get the car
and meet you around front.

04:26.833 --> 04:27.833
Thank you, Benson.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.834
Billy, Major.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.338
Well, I... I suppose

04:33.339 --> 04:34.339
you know why
I wanted the picture,

04:34.340 --> 04:35.841
don't you, Mother?

04:35.842 --> 04:38.343
Yes, Eunice. I know.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.345
What do you think?

04:40.346 --> 04:42.848
I think he looks
better in person.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.350
No, Mother.
I mean, about us.

04:45.351 --> 04:46.852
Well, Eunice,

04:46.853 --> 04:48.353
it's very hard
for me to approve.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.856
I mean, the man's
a convicted killer...

04:50.857 --> 04:54.860
but then, of course,
so is Daddy.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.361
And an embezzler too.

04:56.362 --> 05:00.866
Yes, so it's hard for me
to disapprove too.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.868
The difference is, Eunice,

05:02.869 --> 05:04.870
when your father and I
first started out,

05:04.871 --> 05:07.372
we had all kinds
of possibilities.

05:07.373 --> 05:08.373
The world was ours.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.876
You and Dutch
wouldn't have that.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.878
But I love him, Mother.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.880
I know, Eunice...

05:14.881 --> 05:18.384
but sometimes love
just isn't enough.

05:31.397 --> 05:33.398
Hey! Hey!

05:33.399 --> 05:35.401
Oh.

05:40.406 --> 05:42.407
New York University?

05:42.408 --> 05:44.409
Don't tell me somebody
in this house

05:44.410 --> 05:46.011
is actually thinking
of going to college?

05:47.914 --> 05:49.414
I am going to go to college.

05:53.920 --> 05:54.920
Does the college know?

05:54.921 --> 05:56.922
"Does the college know?"

05:58.424 --> 06:00.425
Well, it may come
as a shock to you,

06:00.426 --> 06:01.927
things have changed.

06:01.928 --> 06:02.928
For instance,

06:02.929 --> 06:04.930
they no longer use
quills and parchments.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.431
Quills and parchments!

06:10.436 --> 06:11.937
I really don't care

06:11.938 --> 06:13.940
to discuss this
with you, Elaine.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.949
Aren't you gonna feel
awfully out of it?

06:23.950 --> 06:26.452
No. Why should I?

06:27.954 --> 06:28.955
Because you're so old.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.959
Elaine, I may not be 20,
but I'm not a dinosaur.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.462
A dinosaur!

06:38.965 --> 06:40.465
I don't know.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.467
If I was your age,
I wouldn't go to college.

06:42.468 --> 06:43.468
Probably wouldn't
leave the house.

06:43.469 --> 06:44.970
That's it!

06:47.974 --> 06:49.975
Hey, hold it! Whoa!

06:49.976 --> 06:51.476
What's happening?

06:51.477 --> 06:52.978
She's crazy!
I'm going to go upstairs.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.980
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

06:54.981 --> 06:56.481
Why didn't you let me...

06:56.482 --> 06:57.482
Why didn't you let me kill her?

06:57.483 --> 06:58.484
I want to!

07:14.000 --> 07:15.500
Ma!

07:15.501 --> 07:18.503
Ma, you don't have to kill her,
because we got a plan.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.506
Yeah. Listen, it's a great plan.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.507
Oh, good.
What is it?

07:22.508 --> 07:25.510
A knife? Poison? What?

07:25.511 --> 07:28.013
We're gonna kill her
with kindness.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.515
You're gonna kill her
with kindness?

07:30.516 --> 07:32.017
That's right...

07:32.018 --> 07:34.020
and I think it's time
to get started.

07:36.022 --> 07:38.023
You see, what he's gonna do

07:38.024 --> 07:41.526
is not let her dress, eat,
sleep, nothing...

07:41.527 --> 07:43.528
because there isn't anything
good enough for her.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.030
And she can't get mad,

07:45.031 --> 07:47.033
because it's all done
out of love, you see?

07:48.034 --> 07:50.035
He's gonna kill her
with kindness.

07:50.036 --> 07:52.037
If that doesn't work,
can I just kill her?

07:52.038 --> 07:53.039
Sure.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.547
Your mother needs hormone shots.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.550
Don't.

08:05.551 --> 08:08.053
It's a brand new dress.

08:08.054 --> 08:10.055
Danny!

08:10.056 --> 08:12.557
Oh, I don't want
garbage like this

08:12.558 --> 08:13.559
touching your skin.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.563
Danny, what is going on?

08:18.564 --> 08:20.565
It's not good enough for you.

08:20.566 --> 08:23.569
Nothing good enough for you,
baby.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.073
Well, it's true,
it only costs $400...

08:28.074 --> 08:30.575
$400?

08:30.576 --> 08:31.576
But wait a second...

08:31.577 --> 08:33.078
Well, I'm sorry,

08:33.078 --> 08:34.578
but it won't do.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.582
Not for you.
Not for my woman.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.086
This isn't like you.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.087
Good God!

08:42.087 --> 08:44.089
Look at this garbage.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.590
I'm sorry, Elaine,

08:45.591 --> 08:47.092
but you can forget about these.

08:47.093 --> 08:48.093
No! No! No!
Wait! Wait!

08:48.094 --> 08:49.094
Please...

08:49.095 --> 08:50.595
No, no, absolutely not, no way.

08:50.596 --> 08:51.596
Elaine, I'm sorry, but, uh,

08:51.597 --> 08:53.098
I love you too much

08:53.099 --> 08:56.102
to see you dressed
in rags like this.

08:58.604 --> 08:59.604
Elaine...

08:59.605 --> 09:00.605
What?

09:00.606 --> 09:01.606
What the hell is that?

09:01.607 --> 09:02.607
What?
That!

09:02.608 --> 09:03.608
What? Oh!

09:03.609 --> 09:04.609
This!

09:04.610 --> 09:06.111
Oh, no!

09:06.112 --> 09:07.612
Danny stop!
Stop it!

09:07.613 --> 09:09.114
You nuts?

09:09.115 --> 09:11.117
Look at how flimsy that is.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.120
I don't believe this.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.622
Don't sit!

09:25.631 --> 09:27.632
This cushion is not clean.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.135
Other people have sat here.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.136
Danny!

09:31.137 --> 09:33.638
We have to be
at a restaurant in 15 minutes.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.140
Let me see
if I can find something

09:35.141 --> 09:36.141
to wear, okay?

09:36.142 --> 09:39.144
Maybe I have something
that you like.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.145
Okay.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.648
Okay, I'll go get cleaned up.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.662
I can't keep my hands off you.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.665
And this one is no good either.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.173
So, is it working?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.174
I don't know.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.675
It's a little too soon to tell,

10:10.676 --> 10:12.677
but she seems very confused.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.179
So am I.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.182
Danny.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.184
Oh, you ready so soon, babe?

10:19.185 --> 10:20.185
Is this all right?

10:20.186 --> 10:23.188
Well, that's more like it.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.689
You're sure?

10:24.690 --> 10:26.191
You're sure that you like this?

10:26.192 --> 10:29.195
It looks almost as good as you.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.204
Don't wait up.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.205
Yeah, have a nice time.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.207
Thanks.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.710
I'm sorry,

10:45.711 --> 10:46.711
but it didn't look as good

10:46.712 --> 10:48.213
from the back.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.727
Well?

11:02.728 --> 11:04.229
What do you say?

11:06.232 --> 11:07.732
Carol, generally,

11:07.733 --> 11:09.234
when a girl gets
a marriage proposal,

11:09.235 --> 11:11.737
she looks up
from her Chicken Yakitori.

11:13.239 --> 11:14.740
What about... sex?

11:21.247 --> 11:22.747
What about it?

11:22.748 --> 11:24.749
You said you would never

11:24.750 --> 11:26.251
go to bed with me again.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.752
Uh, call it old-fashioned,

11:27.753 --> 11:29.754
but I consider
sex with my husband

11:29.755 --> 11:30.756
a part of marriage.

11:40.766 --> 11:41.766
Well, I'd try.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.268
You'd try?

11:43.269 --> 11:44.769
Yeah.

11:44.770 --> 11:45.770
Oh, wonderful.

11:45.771 --> 11:48.273
That's a very relaxing
way to live...

11:48.274 --> 11:49.774
with a guy who closes his eyes

11:49.775 --> 11:51.777
and pretends his wife
is Arnold Schwarzenegger.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.284
Carol, I'm not sure,

11:59.285 --> 12:00.785
but I think when one person

12:00.786 --> 12:01.786
asks someone else to marry them,

12:01.787 --> 12:03.288
no one's supposed
to make fun of anybody

12:03.289 --> 12:04.789
for at least a minute or two.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.791
Why are you doing this, guilt?

12:06.792 --> 12:07.792
No.

12:07.793 --> 12:09.794
Well, it's true,
I think I should,

12:09.795 --> 12:11.796
but, Carol, what's also true

12:11.797 --> 12:14.799
is I'm actually kind of excited
about having the baby.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.302
Somehow I never pictured that.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.803
Neither did I.

12:18.804 --> 12:21.806
Well, I'm not what Dr. Spock
had in mind

12:21.807 --> 12:23.808
when he wrote his chapter,
"Becoming A Father."

12:23.809 --> 12:26.311
It's, uh, it's very hard
not to be involved

12:26.312 --> 12:28.813
when you're bringing a new life
into the world.

12:28.814 --> 12:31.316
Carol, this is my baby too.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.320
And since I've been a part
of its beginning,

12:35.321 --> 12:38.323
I want to be a part
of the rest of its life.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.325
It can work, Carol.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.826
We really care for each other,

12:41.827 --> 12:42.827
and we love being together,

12:42.828 --> 12:44.829
and you'd never have to worry

12:44.830 --> 12:47.332
about me looking
at another woman.

12:49.335 --> 12:53.338
I don't know, Jody.
I just don't know.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.340
Carol, I promise you
that if we get married,

12:55.341 --> 12:56.842
I'll never touch another man
again.

13:00.846 --> 13:02.347
Excuse me, please.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.850
I think I just stabbed myself.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.863
What's wrong?

13:18.864 --> 13:20.865
You stick a rusty knife
into my heart

13:20.866 --> 13:22.367
by leaving the priesthood

13:22.368 --> 13:24.369
and you want to know
what's wrong?

13:24.370 --> 13:26.871
Ma, there's no knife
in anybody's heart.

13:26.872 --> 13:29.874
I feel I've got an elephant
on chest...

13:29.875 --> 13:31.376
and he contradicts me.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.877
That's the kind of thing

13:32.878 --> 13:36.381
a mother really wants to hear
just before she dies.

13:36.382 --> 13:39.384
Sorry, Ma, but the dying act

13:39.385 --> 13:40.885
doesn't work anymore.

13:40.886 --> 13:41.886
You're not fooling anyone.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.389
Tim, I don't think you should be
quite so hard on her.

13:44.390 --> 13:45.390
Oh, perfect!

13:45.391 --> 13:46.891
Your mother's at death's door

13:46.892 --> 13:48.894
and you have to bring along
the bimbo!

13:51.397 --> 13:53.398
Well, it's true
we haven't gotten along

13:53.399 --> 13:54.899
quite as well as we might...

13:54.900 --> 13:55.900
Oh, why stop there?

13:55.901 --> 13:57.402
While you're at it,

13:57.403 --> 14:00.405
why don't you just step forward
and spit on the bed?

14:00.406 --> 14:01.406
Ma!

14:01.407 --> 14:03.408
Listen, you just remember
one thing.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.909
You remember
that if anybody asks you

14:04.910 --> 14:06.911
who killed your mother,

14:06.912 --> 14:08.413
remember to say,

14:08.414 --> 14:10.915
"it was me, Timothy Flotsky,

14:10.916 --> 14:12.917
the fallen priest."

14:12.918 --> 14:14.419
Now get out of here

14:14.420 --> 14:15.920
and let me die in peace.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.422
Look, Ma,

14:17.423 --> 14:19.424
I fell in love with Corrine

14:19.425 --> 14:20.925
and...
and I married her.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.427
For the first time in my life,

14:22.428 --> 14:24.429
I did something for me
instead of for you.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.932
It's called
living your own life, Ma.

14:27.933 --> 14:28.933
But, of course,

14:28.934 --> 14:29.934
you wouldn't know about that.

14:29.935 --> 14:31.436
You know...
all you know about

14:31.437 --> 14:32.437
is making my life miserable

14:32.438 --> 14:33.938
and treating Corrine
like garbage.

14:33.939 --> 14:37.442
You're a real expert at that.

14:37.443 --> 14:38.444
Tim?

14:39.945 --> 14:42.447
She's not breathing.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.449
Of course she's not breathing.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.950
She's playing

14:45.951 --> 14:47.952
her "hold my breath until
I get what I want" routine.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.455
Tim, I think she's dead.

14:50.456 --> 14:51.456
She's not dead.

14:51.457 --> 14:52.957
She's dead.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.459
She's not dead.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.460
She's dead.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.961
She's dead!
She's dead!

14:56.962 --> 14:58.463
She's dead.
She's dead.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.464
She's dead.
She's dead!

14:59.465 --> 15:00.965
She's dead!
She's dead!

15:00.966 --> 15:01.967
She's dead!

15:04.970 --> 15:05.970
Okay. I'll tell him.

15:05.971 --> 15:06.971
Right. Okay.

15:06.972 --> 15:07.973
Bye-bye.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.977
Don't you ever go to lunch?

15:12.978 --> 15:15.480
No, I have it catered.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.983
Um, Mr. DiBlazio called.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.485
Said if he doesn't
have a payment

15:20.486 --> 15:21.486
on your wife's loan by Friday,

15:21.487 --> 15:23.488
he sincerely hopes you have

15:23.489 --> 15:25.491
a good orthopedic surgeon.

15:26.492 --> 15:27.992
Oh, no...

15:27.993 --> 15:29.494
Problems?

15:29.495 --> 15:30.995
Yep.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.998
Oh, you're too nice
to have problems.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.500
Thanks, Sal.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.503
You're much too nice.

15:40.005 --> 15:41.506
Uh, Sally?

15:41.507 --> 15:43.508
Uh... uh, Sally,

15:43.509 --> 15:45.009
what are you doing back there?

15:45.010 --> 15:46.010
Nothing.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.012
Uh, Sally, I'm a married man,

15:48.013 --> 15:49.013
remember?

15:49.014 --> 15:51.516
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.017
I'm really sorry.

15:53.018 --> 15:55.019
I... I just got
carried away.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.021
I mean, it's so hard.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.023
Every day I see you,

15:59.024 --> 16:02.527
and you're so...
incredibly good-looking.

16:04.029 --> 16:08.032
You must know
how irresistible you are.

16:08.033 --> 16:11.035
And it's just so hard not to...

16:11.036 --> 16:13.038
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.542
It's okay.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.544
I'm just really sorry.

16:19.545 --> 16:22.547
Hey, it's really okay.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.549
Anyway...

16:24.550 --> 16:27.051
I'm sure you must be
used to it by now.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.554
Women crawling all over you.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.055
I'm sure you can't even

16:31.056 --> 16:33.057
take public transportation
anymore.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.560
Well, no, that hasn't happened.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.562
I mean,
if Al Pacino ever saw you,

16:37.563 --> 16:39.063
he'd probably never
leave his house again.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.565
I mean, why bother?

16:40.566 --> 16:43.067
Well, I don't know about that.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.569
Believe me.

16:47.573 --> 16:51.576
He is a little short, I hear.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.579
I am sorry, Danny,
and I promise it'll...

16:54.580 --> 16:56.080
it'll never happen again.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.584
From now on,
I'll just look at you...

16:59.585 --> 17:00.586
And be happy.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.088
I don't know, I don't know.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.089
A break is fine,

17:05.089 --> 17:06.089
but I think it's a mistake

17:06.090 --> 17:07.592
for guys
on girders 40 stories high

17:07.593 --> 17:10.596
to be horsing around
with a Frisbee.

17:11.597 --> 17:12.597
I'll go break it up.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.098
Thanks, Danny.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.599
Any messages, Sal?

17:15.601 --> 17:17.602
Nothing, uh-uh.
Oh, good.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.103
I'm so bushed.

17:19.104 --> 17:20.605
Oh, thank you.

17:23.108 --> 17:26.109
Oh... oh, oh.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.612
Oh, that's terrific.

17:27.613 --> 17:30.615
Oh, a massage.
Oh.. oh, boy.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.617
That's terrific.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.118
Oh, massages are wonderful.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.621
I really love that.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.623
Oh, and yes, massaging the head.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.625
That's... nice touch...
very nice touch.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.126
Oh, that's nice.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.628
That's... ooh, hey.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.630
Thank you, thank you...
Thank you very much...

17:45.631 --> 17:47.132
Oh, hey...
Okay, thank you!

17:49.635 --> 17:51.636
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.137
I'm really sorry.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.639
It's okay. It's okay.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.142
Your nose got stuck.
That could happen.

17:59.144 --> 18:00.645
It's so hard for me.

18:02.147 --> 18:05.150
I mean, you must know.
You see how women respond...

18:06.151 --> 18:08.152
To what?

18:08.153 --> 18:09.154
To you.

18:10.656 --> 18:11.656
You're at that age...

18:11.657 --> 18:13.157
That time of your life

18:13.158 --> 18:15.660
when you're at
your most attractive.

18:15.661 --> 18:18.162
Well, yeah... well...

18:18.163 --> 18:20.164
Oh, you are.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.667
You're so...
dynamic.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.669
That's what it is.

18:24.670 --> 18:28.172
You're
dy... na... mic.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.674
Oh... Well, I don't know.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.175
Let's see...

18:31.176 --> 18:33.678
I've been taking
this new Vitamin-B complex.

18:33.679 --> 18:35.179
That's probably
what's doing it...

18:35.180 --> 18:36.681
And it's so hard for me

18:36.682 --> 18:38.182
to be around you every day...

18:38.183 --> 18:39.684
to... to have to
look at you

18:39.685 --> 18:42.186
and to feel your presence.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.188
Sometimes I almost feel faint.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.190
Well, that's not eating
a good breakfast, Sal.

18:46.191 --> 18:48.192
You know, that's a feeling
of faintness,

18:48.193 --> 18:49.193
that's all it is.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.194
No.
Yeah...

18:50.195 --> 18:51.195
It's from you.

18:51.196 --> 18:52.697
No, a couple of eggs,
a few sausages,

18:52.698 --> 18:54.699
you'll be just fine.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.701
I look at you, and I get weak.

18:56.702 --> 18:59.705
It's been that way for weeks,
this weakness.

19:05.210 --> 19:10.715
You're the most masculine man...
I've ever seen.

19:16.221 --> 19:17.722
It's the plaid shirt, Sal.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.223
You're responding
to a plaid shirt.

19:19.224 --> 19:21.726
I got to... Where's Danny?
I got to go find Danny.

19:21.727 --> 19:24.228
If I know Danny,
he's joined the Frisbee team.

19:24.229 --> 19:25.730
It's a...
It's a plaid shirt.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.231
And don't you worry about that.

19:27.232 --> 19:30.234
I mean, I've seen it
happen a lot in Oregon...

19:30.235 --> 19:31.235
all the time.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.738
Girls fainting over lumberjacks.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.252
Oh, doctor, are you sure?

19:48.253 --> 19:50.755
Oh, yes, this is definitely
a lesion of the brain.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.256
You see, it's the type of lesion

19:52.257 --> 19:54.759
that can totally alter
a person's behavior.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.261
For example, a completely
mild-mannered person

19:57.262 --> 19:58.763
might suddenly turn violent.

19:58.764 --> 20:01.265
Well, if that's the case,

20:01.266 --> 20:03.267
then surely a man
in his condition

20:03.268 --> 20:04.268
couldn't be held responsible

20:04.269 --> 20:05.269
for his acts.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.771
Oh, no. Certainly not.

20:06.772 --> 20:09.273
Any behavior induced
by the lesion is, of course,

20:09.274 --> 20:10.274
entirely beyond his control,

20:10.275 --> 20:11.776
and as I understand it,

20:11.777 --> 20:13.778
there has been
a recent unpleasantness.

20:13.779 --> 20:16.781
Is he referring to the murder

20:16.782 --> 20:19.283
or the stock fraud?

20:19.284 --> 20:21.786
Well, whatever the problem,
legally speaking,

20:21.787 --> 20:23.788
he is suffering
from temporary insanity,

20:23.789 --> 20:25.289
and this brain scan alone

20:25.290 --> 20:27.291
is medical proof
of his condition.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.793
Well, what can be done?

20:28.794 --> 20:30.795
I mean, about the lesion itself?

20:30.796 --> 20:32.296
We could do nothing

20:32.297 --> 20:33.798
and perhaps the attacks
would subside,

20:33.799 --> 20:34.799
but, on the other hand,

20:34.800 --> 20:36.300
he might become
permanently violent,

20:36.301 --> 20:38.803
and lastly,
he might just drop dead.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.806
Now, on the other hand,

20:41.807 --> 20:42.807
we could operate,

20:42.808 --> 20:45.309
but, you see, he might not
survive the operation.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.311
Or he might come out
of the surgery alive,

20:47.312 --> 20:50.315
but with the personality
of a cod fish.

20:52.818 --> 20:56.321
Well, it's nice to have
so many choices.

20:57.823 --> 21:00.324
I just wish
one of them were good.

21:00.325 --> 21:01.325
Y... Y... Yes...

21:01.326 --> 21:03.327
Well, this decision
is... is...

21:03.328 --> 21:04.829
Thank you.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.330
Yours and yours
alone, Mrs. Tate,

21:06.331 --> 21:08.332
and, uh, I'm afraid

21:08.333 --> 21:09.834
that there is simply
not much time.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.836
Oh, yes, I understand.

21:11.837 --> 21:12.837
Of course,
it would be much easier

21:12.838 --> 21:14.338
if this were a routine surgery

21:14.339 --> 21:16.841
but this procedure
is far from routine.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.843
It's the kind of surgery
that requires

21:18.844 --> 21:23.347
an extraordinary combination
of knowledge, skill,

21:23.348 --> 21:26.851
not to mention courage
and stamina.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.353
Yes, well, uh, Jessica,

21:29.354 --> 21:30.855
I think if you had an hour or so

21:30.856 --> 21:31.856
alone with your thoughts,

21:31.857 --> 21:32.857
then maybe...

21:32.858 --> 21:34.859
Yes, sir, if I could
pull this one off,

21:34.860 --> 21:36.861
this would be quite a feat.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.362
Doctor.

21:38.363 --> 21:39.363
Oh, yes!

21:39.364 --> 21:40.865
Well, that's neither here
nor there.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.366
Well, I...

21:42.367 --> 21:44.869
I guess you'd better go ahead.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.370
You want me to go ahead
with the surgery?

21:46.371 --> 21:48.372
Yes!
Oh!

21:48.373 --> 21:50.875
You made a wise decision,
Mrs. Tate.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.376
This will be good
for everyone concerned,

21:52.377 --> 21:54.879
and the chances of your husband
pulling through are very good.

21:54.880 --> 21:59.885
And I, of course,
will be launched into stardom.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.387
Oh, Mary...

22:03.388 --> 22:05.890
I didn't know what to do.

22:05.891 --> 22:08.893
Do you think I did
the right thing?

22:08.894 --> 22:10.394
I'm sure you did, Jess.

22:10.395 --> 22:11.896
I'm sure you did.

22:11.897 --> 22:14.899
Golly, it's just such
a difficult decision to make.

22:14.900 --> 22:15.900
I know.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.401
Chester might die.

22:17.402 --> 22:18.903
He won't.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.404
But the doctor said...
No.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.407
He'll be fine,
I just know he will.

22:23.408 --> 22:24.909
Do you think so?

22:24.910 --> 22:26.911
Yes, I do.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.913
Chester is very strong.

22:28.914 --> 22:31.916
That's right. He is, isn't he?

22:31.917 --> 22:35.920
Oh, yes, Mary, do you remember
the winter we all had the flu

22:35.921 --> 22:38.422
and Chester had the flu,
and he did all the cooking,

22:38.423 --> 22:39.423
flu and all?

22:39.424 --> 22:42.927
Of course,
he did all the eating too...

22:44.429 --> 22:47.431
Mary, he's just
got to be all right.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.434
He has to be.

22:52.938 --> 22:55.941
I don't think
I could stand anything else.

23:01.446 --> 23:04.448
I'll buy you a cheeseburger.

23:04.449 --> 23:05.950
With French fries?

23:05.951 --> 23:06.952
Mm-hmm.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.962
<i>Will Burt and Danny's plan</i>
<i>really change Elaine?</i>

23:17.963 --> 23:20.965
<i>If it does,</i>
<i>what will she change into?</i>

23:20.966 --> 23:22.967
<i>Will Carol</i>
<i>accept Jody's proposal?</i>

23:22.968 --> 23:25.970
<i>Will Tim blame himself</i>
<i>for his mother's death forever?</i>

23:25.971 --> 23:27.972
<i>Or just</i>
<i>for the rest of his life?</i>

23:27.973 --> 23:29.473
<i>What is Sally up to?</i>

23:29.474 --> 23:31.976
<i>And are either Burt or Danny</i>
<i>up to what she's up to?</i>

23:31.977 --> 23:34.979
<i>Will Eunice ever spend</i>
<i>another night with Dutch?</i>

23:34.980 --> 23:36.981
<i>And if so,</i>

23:36.982 --> 23:38.482

23:38.483 --> 23:40.484

<i>some nice refreshments?</i>

23:40.485 --> 23:42.486
