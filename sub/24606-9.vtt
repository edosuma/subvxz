You're enjoying this, aren't you?

21:28.240 --> 21:30.436
You're playing games
while my people die.

21:30.520 --> 21:34.309
Had I not intervened,
Chau would now rule the Badlands.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.073
Your people would be under her yoke,

21:36.160 --> 21:39.118
and your arrogance would have
delivered them into bondage,

21:39.200 --> 21:41.157

21:42.320 --> 21:46.632
Well, if I'm such a disappointment,
then tell me why am I here?

21:49.960 --> 21:52.190
A fight is coming, Minerva.

21:52.280 --> 21:56.160
And while you squabble
over resources and territory,

21:56.240 --> 21:58.959
the fate of humanity
hangs in the balance.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.237
You must face your true enemy,
before it's too late.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.719
You mean Pilgrim?

22:03.840 --> 22:06.514
I've seen him. He can control the Gift.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.511
Pilgrim has the Gift himself now,

22:08.600 --> 22:10.750
and he's discovered
a way to give it to others.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.229
You have to be born with the Gift.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.277
Usually, yes.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.796
But it wasn't always so.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.919
What Pilgrim has wrought is unnatural.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.799
He is playing god
with a power beyond reckoning.

22:25.880 --> 22:29.475
He intends to build an army
of gifted zealots,

22:29.560 --> 22:31.836
and if he succeeds...

22:33.440 --> 22:35.397
not even my Abbots can stop him.

22:36.240 --> 22:38.516
So what part can I play?

22:48.960 --> 22:52.999
You must find a way
to see past your hatred of me.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.950
If we don't work together,

22:57.040 --> 23:01.398
your people will become slaves
to someone far worse.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.871
The Gift was never meant
to dominate or control.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.031
