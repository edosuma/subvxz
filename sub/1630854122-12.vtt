38:24.402 --> 38:26.137
I'm not saying
he shouldn't go to prison,

38:26.137 --> 38:28.806
but Kennard is
a victim here too.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.809
That has to count
for something.

I looked further into the file

There's a lot more
about Paul and Anna's parents.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.159
Go on.

38:48.159 --> 38:52.163
Ewald and Elsa Havertz
were Stasi spies.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.964
They spied for East Germany
for years

38:53.964 --> 38:55.866

to switch sides.

38:55.866 --> 38:57.401
Looks like they stole
the Indigo file

38:57.401 --> 38:59.203

38:59.203 --> 39:03.441
That's why Simon Ballack
had them killed.

39:03.441 --> 39:05.643
Should we tell them
the truth?

39:05.643 --> 39:08.312
After everything that Paul
and Anna have been through,

39:08.312 --> 39:11.015
do they really
need to know this?

39:13.284 --> 39:16.487

39:16.487 --> 39:18.689
Many of us asked ourselves
that question

39:18.689 --> 39:21.959

39:21.959 --> 39:23.794
What is more important:

39:23.794 --> 39:28.933
confronting the truth
or preserving our memories?

39:46.650 --> 39:48.052
Katrin, I--

39:48.052 --> 39:50.154
You don't need
to say anything, Simon.

39:50.154 --> 39:52.957
I'm not here
for an explanation.

39:52.957 --> 39:57.128
Then will you accept
an apology?

40:00.431 --> 40:02.800
I'm sorry.

40:02.800 --> 40:06.036
For lying.

40:06.036 --> 40:08.305
For hurting you.

40:09.707 --> 40:14.245
The world will pass judgment
on me soon enough,

40:14.245 --> 40:19.750
but the only person's opinion
I care about...

40:19.750 --> 40:22.686
is yours.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.992
Do you remember how,
after the war,

40:27.992 --> 40:30.261
they took the rubble
of destroyed buildings

40:30.261 --> 40:33.697
and used it to make hills
all over Berlin?

40:33.697 --> 40:37.101
The Schuttberge.

40:37.101 --> 40:40.204
They built two
in the Volkspark.

40:40.204 --> 40:43.641
But by the time I was a girl

40:43.641 --> 40:47.778
and my father
pointed them out to me,

40:47.778 --> 40:51.315
the rubble had already been
covered with natural growth.

40:51.315 --> 40:56.120
They just looked like
another part of the landscape.
