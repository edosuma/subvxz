DAMN, THAT IS SEXY.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000

BLACK MALE THAT MATCHES THAT

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000

GROUPS WAS SWIFT.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000

UP-AND-COMING R&B STAR!

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
TO DO IS GET SOME CLOTHES ON.

NOT TO SHOW IT, OUR MONEY
PROBLEMS HAD CLEARLY MADE

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
HERE IS WHERE ROBERT JEBEDIAH FREEMAN, WAR

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
SITTING ON THE COUCH WATCHING TV.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
GRANDDAD A LITTLE CRAZY.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
SEGREGATION WAS IN THE DEEP
SOUTH.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
APPROXIMATELY 200 MILLION.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIS SONGS --
"TITTY TELETHON"?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
HERO AND CIVIL-RIGHTS LEGEND, DECIDED TO SPEND HIS FINAL

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
WHAT WAS ONCE A PRODUCTIVE SENIOR CITIZEN WAS NOW REDUCED

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
WOULD BE INVESTIGATING THE
MATTER.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Granddad: SEGREGATION WAS SO
BAD BACK THEN, MY RULE WAS IF IT

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
HEY, TV EXECUTIVES!

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Granddad: HUEY, RILEY, IS
THAT ELECTRICITY I HEAR?!

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
AND HOW MANY OF  THOSE  FANS
DONATED $4  BILLION  TO CHARITY?

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, PEOPLE
STARTED USING THE "B" WORD.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
"PLEASURE ME ORALLY"?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
TO A COUCH POTATO.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
"DON'T TOUCH MY ANUS, GIRL"?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
DAYS.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
ALL RIGHT, THINK.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
WELL, IF YOU GOT TO BE BROKE, AT

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
HOW WOULD I HAVE HEARD THIS?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
BUT THINGS DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT AS PLANNED.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
WAS IN THE SOUTH, IT WASN'T
WORTH IT.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000

SHOW?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
NONE OF THEM, GEORGE.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
HUEY, WHAT DO WE DO?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
AND MOST OF MY FAMILY WAS IN THE
SOUTH, AND I DIDN'T CARE.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
WE SHOULD CALL THIS
RILEY FREEMAN WHAT HE IS --

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
THIS HOUSE IS AN AIRPLANE.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
GOOD!

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000

BETTER.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
TURN OFF ALL YOUR ELECTRONIC
DEVICES AND KEEP THEM OFF.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
'CAUSE THE NEW KARDASHIAN HAS
NEW IDEAS!

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
A BULLY.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Huey: WE'RE RIGHT HERE,
GRANDDAD.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
THEY WERE NOT WORTH IT.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
WHAT'S ON, RILEY?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
THE NEXT SHOWING OF

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
WHITE STATIONS.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
SO, IT'S WITH THAT BACKDROP

Riley: MAN, ALL THESE
CHANNELS, AND THERE AIN'T

WORLD, ALL OF THE RILEYS, WE

MATTER OF FACT, GET OUT HERE!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Granddad: HOT DAMN.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
MR. SPIELBERG'S MOVIE IS 7:30.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
WE HAVE NO HOME.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT
HER.

00:53.000 --> 00:53.000
NOTHING ON.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
WAIT...THERE'S
"THE RICKEY SMILEY SHOW."

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WE ARE LEAVING WOODCREST
FOREVER.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WE HAVE NO FUTURE.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
YOU SHOULD BE DONE TRYING ON
THOSE CLOTHES.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WOULD YOU LIKE TICKETS?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE
DISASTER SINCE WE MOVED HERE.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
WE HAVE NOTHING!

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
VENTURE INTO THE DEEP SOUTH TO
DEFY THOSE IMMORAL LAWS.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Granddad: NOPE.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
SURE, AND, UH, DO YOU SPEAK
BOCCE?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
MR. STINKMEANER, DO YOU

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
SAY "NO."

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
EH, IT'S NOT MY THING, BUT
IT'S WHAT PASSES FOR R&B NOW,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
YEP. I LOVE KARDASHIA.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Audience: NO!

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Riley: I CAN'T WEAR THIS.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
LET'S EXTRAPOLATE THAT THERE...

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
BOCCE IS A FICTIONAL LANGUAGE

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'VE JUST TOLD
YOU?

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
AND IN HONOR OF THAT
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG BOY WHO WAS

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
ALL RIGHT?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Riley: TRUE THAT. TRUE THAT.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Granddad: WHY NOT?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
NOT TOO MUCH OF A MAN TO ADMIT
IT.

00:59.000 --> 00:59.000
WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Huey: NOW, THAT'S TRUE,
GRANDDAD.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
DON'T TELL ANYONE IT'S FROM THE
THRIFT STORE.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
ROBERT JEBEDIAH FREEMAN IS A
VERY ODD RECURRING CHARACTER IN

00:59.000 --> 00:59.000
RED...

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
IN THE "STAR WARS" UNIVERSE.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I'M A CLONE!

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I GOT TEENAGE DAUGHTERS.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Granddad: WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE SAFE, BORING LIVES.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
SHE HAS EVERYTHING I NEED IN A
WOMAN.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.000
BITCH!

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Granddad: WHAT'S THAT?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
SHARING HIS LOVE OF DANCE WITH
HIS CLASSMATES IN THAT VIDEO...

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
THEY'RE INTO BLACK GUYS, SO THIS
IS WHAT I GOT TO HEAR.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
THEY WOULDN'T KNOW.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Riley: "BASKETBALL WIVES."

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
IT DOES NOT EXIST, THEREFORE I CANNOT SPEAK IT.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
YES, CREATED AT THIS SECRET
AND HIGHLY ILLEGAL UNDERGROUND

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
LOOKS STYLISH TO ME.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
EVEN THOUGH AIN'T NONE OF THEM
REALLY WIVES EXCEPT MALAYSIA.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD OLD
DAYS WHEN BLACK SINGERS WOULD

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I WAS SUPPOSED TO FIND SOME HOT,
FINANCIALLY DESPERATE OR

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000

MM-MMM-MMM!

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
SIRI, WHO SHOT FIRST -- HAN
OR GREEDO?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Huey: IT'S NOT STYLISH.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
HE IS A SELF-DESCRIBED
CIVIL RIGHTS LEGEND, WHICH I

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
YUH-HUH.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
HUMAN CLONING FACILITY.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Granddad: IF KRIS KROSS CAN
JUMP IN THEM, YOU CAN WALK TO

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
SHOULD JUST CALL IT
"BASKETBALL JUMPOFFS."

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
DRESS IN HIGH-HEEL BOOTS OR BURN
HOOKERS WITH CRACK PIPES?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED MAMA AND
SETTLE DOWN.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
IT'S STILL EDGY, NOT ONLY 'CAUSE
HE'S BLACK, BUT INSTEAD OF LONG

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
WHATEVER YOU SAY, GEORGE.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
WHY AM I SO OLD?!

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
MEANWHILE, A DAY AFTER THE

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
FEEL IS, WELL, NOT AT ALL
ACCURATE.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Granddad: OOOOH.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
EH, WHAT?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
BUT NOTHING WORKED OUT AS
PLANNED.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
SCHOOL IN THEM.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
OH, MAN, LOOK AT THEM GO!

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
IF YOU CLONED ME WHEN YOU SAY
YOU DID, SHOULDN'T I STILL BE A

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
YOU'RE SHOWING YOUR AGE, MY
FRIEND.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Riley: FOR REAL, GRANDDAD?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
MONEY, HE'S GOT LONG BALLS.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000

STUPID, BIZARRE EPISODE AFTER

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Huey: IS THIS HOW YOU'RE
GONNA GO OUT, GRANDDAD?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
THE MAN WHO YOU ARE A CLONE

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Riley: I AIN'T NO BULLY, AND
ALL Y'ALL OUT THERE SAYING THAT

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
END OF THE ROAD FOR ME.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
FRUSTRATIONS.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
YEP.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Granddad: EXCUSE ME, I WANT
TO BUY THE THING THAT I SAW ON

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000

01:20.000 --> 01:33.000
Granddad: ONE TICKET FOR
CHICAGO, THANK YOU KINDLY.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I MEAN, WASN'T LIKE HE WAS GONNA
BE IN THE NBA.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Granddad: WELL, I HAVE
LEARNED MY LESSON.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
TIME FOR THIS.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
THE TV WITH THE GEORGE LUCAS --
THE GIRL IN THE PHONE.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
A FEW DAYS LATER, HE DIED IN A
STREET FIGHT.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
THAT PROMPTED AN IMMEDIATE
RESPONSE FROM "NO PROBE," THE

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
BUILDER REFUSED

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Huey: WE WERE CAUGHT IN A
CYCLE OF DESPAIR, VIOLENCE, AND

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
>> Granddad: YOU GUYS GO.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO TO ME?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
SO IF HE HAPPY LOOKIN' AT HOES
HE CAN'T BAG, LEAVE HIM BE.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
INSPIRATION THAT MADE LADY SING

01:24.000 --> 01:24.000
WE'RE LEAVING.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Huey: WAIT A MINUTE,
GRANDDAD.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I'M NOT COMING.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Granddad: NOT REALLY.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000

NATIONAL ORGANIZATION PROVIDING
RESEARCH FOR OUTTIE BUTTHOLES.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I'M GOING TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
POVERTY.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
HE DEAD! I'M ALIVE!

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
OF THE ROAD IN MY DRAWERS WITH

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I HAD TO FIND A REAL SOLUTION.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
YOU'RE SECURE!

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Granddad: LOOK AT THE
BREASTS...THE BUTTS...

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
UM, I'M NOT SURE I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Granddad: WHATEVER DO YOU
MEAN, GRANDSON?

01:27.000 --> 01:27.000
A JOB!

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
LIKE, HOW YOU DON'T GET UPSET
WHEN FANS THINK YOU'RE MY DRIVER

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
HE LEFT YOU THOSE CLOTHES,

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
UNTIL THE

01:28.000 --> 01:28.000
Granddad: HUH?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
WHOO!

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
STEREOTYPES -- THE LANGUAGE
OF HATE.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Huey: I MEAN, YOU NEVER TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY OR LEARN A

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
MAN COMES.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Huey: WHY DON'T YOU GET A
JOB?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
WE HAVE A LOT OF STUFF IN OUR
PHONES, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
THEN I'M GONNA GO OUT LIKE A

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Granddad and Riley: HEY!

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Huey: I'M SERIOUS, GRANDDAD.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Granddad: UPSET?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Huey: CAN'T YOU SEE THIS IS
WHAT THE 1% WANTS?

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
IN WOODCREST, TENSIONS WERE
HIGH, THEIR CHANTS WERE CLEAR...

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
LESSON...EVER.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
BUCKET  YOU NIGGA."

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
GIRLS  COME IN THE PHONE.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
HE ASKED THAT IF THE CLONING WAS
SUCCESSFUL, WE RELAY THIS

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Granddad: UH...

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
>> Riley: GRANDDAD!

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
LOTS OF OLD PEOPLE ARE GOING
BACK TO WORK.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
HMM!

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
FOR US TO BECOME SLACKERS THAT
ZONE OUT ON TV AND EAT CHEAP

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I WISH.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
THEY WERE OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Huey: WE'RE BROKE, AREN'T WE,
GRANDDAD?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Granddad: AND THEY'RE
HORRIBLE AT IT!

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Granddad: THE DAY I WAS
LEAVING, IT WAS ALL OVER THE

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Crowd: BULLY, BULLY, STAY
BACK!

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Granddad: EHHH...

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
YOU LOOK REAL GAY.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000

Riley: WHAT YOU GOT AGAINST
CHEAP FOOD?

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000

ROBERT J. FREEMAN.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000

CHEAP FOOD TASTES GOOD, AND IT'S
CHEAP.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
GEORGE LUCAS, AND THE PHONE WAS,
LIKE, A SMART WOMAN.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
...THEIR SIGNS  CRYSTAL  CLEAR.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
HUEY, YOU CRAZY, BOY.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
WHO GIVE A DAMN THEIR KIDS DON'T

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
THESE FREEDOM RIDERS -- YOUNG,
IDEALISTIC, BOLD KIDS WHO WERE

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Granddad: HEY, KIDS.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000

01:40.000 --> 01:40.000
I AM THE STONE THAT THE

SIRI, THE PERSONAL

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
EVERYBODY KNOW GRANDDAD GOT LOTS
OF PAPER.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Huey: BUT YOU'D BE BETTER
THAN A REGULAR OLD PERSON.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Huey: YEAH, AND IT'LL KILL
YOU.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
WARM REGARDS, NIGGA.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Ruckus: UNCLE RUCKUS AIN'T
GOT NO DOG IN THIS FIGHT.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
RIDING BUSES FROM
WASHINGTON, D.C., TO NEW ORLEANS

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Riley: I GOT SIMPLE RULES FOR
GRANDDAD'S NEW GIRLS.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Riley: UNTIL THEY MAKE A
SALAD THAT TASTES LIKE RIBS,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
O.G. STINKMEANER."

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
TELL HIM, GRANDDAD.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
INSPIRATION THAT MADE LADY SING

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
VOICE-ACTIVATED ASSISTANT ON THE
iPHONE.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
YOU'RE STILL FAST.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I HATE NIGGAS, AND I HATE
AND I ESPECIALLY HATE

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000

SEGREGATION -- END JIM CROW.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Huey: CAN'T YOU SEE,
GRANDDAD?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
WELL, THE iPHONES ARE RIGHT OVER
HERE.

01:46.000 --> 01:46.000
WE HAVE STRONG GENES.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
IF IT'S MARKED WITH A BLACK
BUBBLE GRAFFITI "R," PAWS OFF!

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I'M SORRY, BOYS.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
YOU TOLD US WE COME FROM
HARDWORKING SHARECROPPERS,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
THEY DULL OUR MINDS WITH
POISONOUS FOOD AND MINDLESS TV,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
THE PAPER SAID THEY WERE
EXPECTED TO ARRIVE IN ALABAMA

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
THERE WERE SOME ENHANCEMENTS.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
WHEN THEY BOTH COMBINE TOGETHER,
LIKE THAT DAMN RuPaul --

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Riley: AW, NO, GRANDDAD.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
OOH! JUST LIKE YOU SAID --

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Granddad: I CAN'T READ A
SCREEN THAT SMALL!

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
YOU DIDN'T!

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
PORTERS, SLAVES.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
THEN WHILE WE'RE FAT AND SICK,
THEY'RE GETTING RICH.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Granddad: YEAH, AND AFTER ALL
THAT, A NIGGER IS TIRED.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
SOMETIME THAT AFTERNOON, AND I
REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF,

01:51.000 --> 01:51.000
I'M OLD!

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
I NEED SOMETHING BIGGER!

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
TWO THINGS I HATE IN ONE.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, CALM DOWN.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
FEISTY!

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
HEY, KIDS, WELCOME TO THE
NIGGA MOMENT REBOOT!

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Granddad: EXCUSE ME FOR A
QUICK SECOND.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Riley: WHO IS "THEY"?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Huey: WELL, I THINK YOU COULD
DO IT.

01:54.000 --> 02:06.000
"I'M SO GLAD I WON'T BE HERE
WHEN THEM NIGGAS SHOW UP."

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GONNA DO
SOME  WE ALREADY DID AND

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
SERIOUSLY, ONLY KIND OF WHITE
MAN I CAN'T RESPECT IS A  GAY

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
MWAH!

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I DON'T SEE NOBODY BUT YOU,
NIGGA.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
MAYBE I SHOULD GET ONE OF THOSE.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
GRANDDAD, WHAT WE GOT TO EAT?!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Granddad: YEAH.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Huey: THE WEALTHY RULING
CLASS IN AMERICA.

01:57.000 --> 01:57.000
HOW BAD IS IT?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
WE HAVE NO MONEY?

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
IF YOU'RE SO SMART, TELL ME
EXACTLY WHERE ARE THESE JOBS

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Both: OUCH!

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
SO NOW YOU WANT A LAPTOP.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
WHITE MAN.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Granddad: RENT!

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Granddad: WORSE.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Riley: HEY!

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Granddad: YES, BUT I STILL
WANT THE WOMAN.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
JUST PRETEND YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT
THE FIRST TIME!

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
THEM AND THE AVERAGE WHITE BAND,
'CAUSE THEY MAKE NIGGER MUSIC.

01:59.000 --> 01:59.000
Riley: I'M HUNGRY!

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Granddad: THEN HAVE SLEEP FOR
DINNER!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Riley: WORSE?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
WHAT'S WORSE THAN NO MONEY?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
HIRING OLD BLACK FOLK?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Huey: WHO IS THAT?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
SIRI?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
YOU CAN EAT TOMORROW.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Huey: WHEN TIMES GOT ROUGH,
WHAT JOBS DID BLACK FOLKS HAVE

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Riley: PIZZA GUY.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Granddad: WHATEVER THE BITCH
NAME IS, YES!

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
THAT'S RIGHT, NIGGA!

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
BUILDER REFUSED

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
YOU'RE GETTING FAT ANYWAY!

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Huey: WE'RE IN DEBT.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Granddad: DAMN IT!

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I WANT HER, BUT I WANT HER IN THIS!

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
THE SECURITY-CAMERA FOOTAGE
YOU'RE WATCHING IS ALLEGEDLY OF

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Granddad: MM-HMM.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
AS YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN A
BLACK CLOUD FOLLOWING US, BUT

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
WE DON'T RESPECT YOUR
INTELLIGENCE!

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
INSPIRATION THAT MADE LADY SING

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Huey: HOW MUCH?

02:04.000 --> 02:04.000
BEFORE?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
TRY THOSE.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Huey: WRONG ADDRESS.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I WANT THE COMPUTER WOMAN IN THE
COMMERCIAL.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Granddad: A COUPLE...

DON'T GET ME WRONG. UNH-UNH.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
BECAUSE OF THIS CHICK, THAT
CLOUD HAS OPENED UP AND SHE'S

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Riley: NIGGA, I'M HUNGRY.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I WANT IT ON THAT.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Huey: HUNDRED THOUSAND?

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
OHH, THE HUMILIATION WE HAD TO
ENDURE.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
MAKING IT RAIN!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Granddad: YEAH!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
DO Y'ALL HAVE THAT SCREEN THING
THAT YOU CAN, LIKE, TOUCH THE

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
NEED TO MAKE ONE AT HOME!

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000

ROTE, DEHUMANIZING WORK?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Granddad: LONG AS SHE WANTS
THEM.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
SCREEN INSTEAD OF TYPING?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
FIRST, YOU'LL NEED TWO BLACK
MEN, AGE 5 TO 122.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO
CLEARLY SEE THE SUSPECT'S FACE,

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
YOU MEAN THE iPAD?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
UGH!

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Granddad: YES, iPAD.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Sarah: I'M TIRED OF IT!

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN
10 YEARS?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
SPECIAL WHITE-PEOPLE QUILTED
TOILET PAPER!

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I GET PAID A FEW MILLION TO
SHILL A PRODUCT, AND PEOPLE WHO

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I'M HONORED TO BE YOUR ASSISTANT.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Granddad: What's wrong with

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
IT'S BORING!

04:03.000 --> 04:03.000
FOR MAYOR.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
DON'T WANT TO DO?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
MY NAME IS SIRI.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
NOBODY CALLED YOU.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
IT'S BORING ME TO DEATH!

04:04.000 --> 04:04.000
WHY?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO...

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
LIVE IN THEIR MOTHER'S BASEMENTS

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000

HONORED TO...

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
GOD  CALLED ME,
BROTHER ROBERT, AND TOLD ME TO

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Granddad: DEAD.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Somebody help me!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Tom: SARAH, PLEASE CALM DOWN!

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
A NEW FACE IN THE REPUBLICAN
CAMPAIGN RACE -- FROM SEEMINGLY

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
STARVING KIDS THE MONEY I JUST
MADE COULD HAVE SAVED.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Granddad: EDDIE, WHAT THE
HELL DO YOU CALL YOURSELF

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
COME STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
WITH YOU IN YOUR HOUR OF NEED.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
WHAT? I'M OLD.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
OWN AN iPHONE, SIRI.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
THE POLICE!

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I SAID I APOLOGIZE!

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
RUSHING UP IN MY HOUSE AND
FORCING ME TO COME HERE?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
THESE ARE MY TWO IDIOT
GRANDCHILDREN, HUEY AND RILEY.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
SOMETIMES WHEN I SNEEZE, I

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Granddad: OH, OKAY. HAVE FUN.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
HEY, LI'L NIGGAS.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
OUT OF NOWHERE, A
MR. UNCLE RUCKUS.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I DON'T WANT Y'ALL LAYING
AROUND THE HOUSE GETTING CHUNKY

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
AH, YES, THE VISIONARY

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
THANK GOD FOR THE POLICE!

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Huey: ROLLO GOODLOVE?!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Sarah: THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
ROBERT FREEMAN -- WHEN HE GOT ON
THE BUS.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
OH.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN!

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
LOOK AT THAT.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
ONCE --
MOVING ON.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
DOMESTIC TERRORIST AND THE GANGSTER MASTERMIND, ALSO KNOWN

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
THE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU IS,

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
THAT'S IT.

04:13.000 --> 04:13.000
Tom: DOING WHAT?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Sarah: APOLOGIZING!

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
FINANCED BY BILLIONAIRE
BANKING TYCOONS AND MR. BURNS

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
OH, HOW THE HIGH YELLOW SHALL BE

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
BOY, I LOVE THAT.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
AND WHATNOT, SO I FIGURED A JOB
IN THE FRESH AIR WOULD DO YOU

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
NOW WE REALLY  ARE  DOOMED.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Tom: YOU DON'T WANT ME TO
APOLOGIZE?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU PUT FOR
GREATEST WEAKNESS.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
YOU KNOW HE'S ONLY GONNA MAKE IT
WORSE, RIGHT?

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
KNOCK-OFF ED WUNCLER AND HIS
ECONOMY-CRUSHING SON, EDDIE JR.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
LAST, AND THE LAST SHALL BE HIGH

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
NOW, I REMEMBER SEEING HIM FOR
THE FIRST TIME AND THINKING,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
AS "THE FUNDRAISER."

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
HE'S NOT PRESSING ANY CHARGES.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Sarah: NO, I DON'T!

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Granddad: PORK CHOPS.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
GENTLEMEN GOOD.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
SHE  DOES  WORK!

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
WORSE?!

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Tom: OKAY, I'M SORRY I'M
APOLOGIZING.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
YELLOW.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
ARE YOU EVEN TAKING THIS
SERIOUSLY?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Huey: YOU FIGURED OUT ANOTHER
WAY TO USE US TO MAKE MONEY.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Granddad: HE'S NOT PRESSING
CHARGES?!

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
HOW AM I MAKE IT WORSE?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
>> Granddad: LEAVE ME ALONE,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
"OOH, HE'S REALLY FRAIL."

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I SEE ON WIKIPEDIA YOUR

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
THEY DON'T  NEVER  FORGIVE!

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
RUCKUS.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Granddad: ARE YOU?!

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
NICKNAME IS "BITCHES."

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
HE ATTACKED  ME!

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Sarah: YOU DID IT AGAIN!

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
THIS MR. RUCKUS IS NOT -- I
REPEAT, NOT -- AN

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I'M WORKING AS FAST AS I CAN.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
THESE RIDICULOUS QUESTIONS.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
YEP. SMART KID.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I  WANT TO PRESS CHARGES!

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Tom: SARAH, CALM DOWN!

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
>> Ruckus: AH, YEAH, NIGGA.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
IF YOU, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,
THINK I AM COMPLETELY UNHIRABLE,

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Riley: HATER ALERT!

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I OPENED A LIVING-HISTORY THEME
PARK.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CALL YOU THAT FROM NOW ON?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
THERE WERE AT LEAST 53
RECORDINGS OF THE INCIDENT,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Huey: MAYBE BECAUSE YOU KEEP
CALLING THEM

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I'M SORRY.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
OH, THIS AIN'T NOTHING LIKE THE

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
HATER ALERT!

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I'M SORRY!

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, BUT, RATHER, A
CAUCASIAN MAN SUFFERING FROM A

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
HATER ALERT!

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE!

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I CAN'T STOP!

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
MOVIE "CAR WASH," IS IT, NIGGA?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Granddad: I NOTICED SHE WAS
READING RALPH ELLISON'S

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Riley: BORING.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
MR. FREEMAN.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
A
HUH?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
OH, NO. UNH-UNH. UNH-UNH.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
FINE.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
NIGGA JUST MAD HE DIDN'T GET
TOYS!

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
BRINGS THE 19th CENTURY TO
LIFE.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
IN ALL OF THEM, YOU ATTACK  HIM
FIRST.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Sarah: OH, I SWEAR TO GOD,
TOM, IF YOU APOLOGIZE AGAIN, YOU

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
UNH-UNH.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
MR. FREEMAN, THESE ARE
STANDARD JOB-PLACEMENT

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
"INVISIBLE MAN," A BOOK I HAD
MEANT TO READ MANY TIMES.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Granddad: BUT I HAD TO!

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Riley: SEE?  HE  GETS IT.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
RARE SKIN CONDITION CALLED
REVITILIGO.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
AIN'T NO SINGING, NO DANCING, NO

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T EVEN
SAY  ON TV ANYMORE?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
ARE OUT OF HERE!

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
QUESTIONS.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Huey: YOU'RE FORCING BLACK
PEOPLE TO RE-ENACT THE MOST

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
HE'S A PSYCHOPATH!

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
RICHARD PRYOR -- NOTHING.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
THEY'RE ON EVERYONE'S
APPLICATION.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I'M SORRY ABOUT MY LANGUAGE.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I  KILLED  HIM, AND...

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Tom: I'M --
MM.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I JUST...I GET SO UPSET AT THE
INJUSTICE OF SEGREGATION.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
PAINFUL PERIOD IN OUR HISTORY?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
YOU CAN SAY "NIGGA" ALL DAY, BUT
YOU CAN'T SAY

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
LIBERALS ARE, OF COURSE,
RIDICULING THIS MAN'S DISEASE,

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
OH, BY THE WAY, THAT LAZY

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
BUT WITH COTTON CANDY AND A
MERRY-GO-ROUND!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
GO ON.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
OKAY.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
MEXICAN SUMBITCH CHICO CANCELED,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
LET ME BE FRANK -- YOU ARE
UNHIRABLE.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
ROBERT. WAKE UP, ROBERT.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Granddad: I MEAN, NOT  HIM,
BUT IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
AND THEY'LL BLEEP
IT.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
THEN JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
WHICH, I CAN ASSURE YOU, IS
COMPLETELY REAL -- UNLIKE RAPE.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Sarah: THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
TOM!

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
AND I NEED YOU TO STAY TILL

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
IT'S OKAY.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
WHY WE GOT TO CLEAN, ANYWAY?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
AND COME ON, HUEY, NOT JUST
BLACK PEOPLE.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
SAY "NIGGA" -- NO PROBLEM.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
CLOSING TIME.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
YOU COME ACROSS AS UNEDUCATED,
YOU'VE JUST PROVEN YOU'RE

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
THAT MAN IS GOING TO ATTACK ME
AGAIN!

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT
TO DO!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
>> Granddad: BUT I HAD PLANS

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Granddad: WELL, SEE, I HAD TO
GO INTO THE BATHROOM TO TAKE A

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
WATCH.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT I WANT YOU
TO DO BUT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Huey:  YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Granddad: BECAUSE WE MAY BE
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I'M PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH TO FORCE
ALL RACES TO RE-ENACT YOUR

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
I DON'T MEAN TO OFFEND YOU OR
MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT, OH,

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
NIGGA, NIGGA, NIGGA!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
TONIGHT.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
COMFORTABLE CURSING IN A
PROFESSIONAL SETTING, AND --

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
DU-- UH, STAND AGAINST
SEGREGATION.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
GOOD MORNING, SIRI.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
NIGGA

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
UNCLE RUCKUS RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND BASICALLY ALMOST WON.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
>> Ruckus: PLANS? PLANS?

04:40.000 --> 04:40.000
DO IT!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
AIN'T NO NIGGA MAKE NO PLANS!

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
THAT MUST BE KARDASHIA.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
PAINFUL HISTORY IF THEY OWE ME
MONEY.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
GOOD MORNING, ROBERT.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Riley: THANK GOD FOR

04:41.000 --> 04:41.000
Tom: WHAT?!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
BUT WHY NOT JUST TELL ME?!

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
WAIT!

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
AND THEY SAID, "NIGGA, DON'T YOU
DARE GO INTO THAT BATHROOM."

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
YOU HAVE A BUSY DAY TODAY.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A NIGGA MOMENT
IS?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
UNCENSORED DVDs.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
HIS STANDOUT MOMENT WAS DURING

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
NIGGAS JUST REACT TO OUTSIDE

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I THINK I HAVE THE PERFECT JOB.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
EVEN JEWS!

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Granddad: WHAT ARE WE DOING?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Sarah: BECAUSE!

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
STIMULI.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
OF COURSE.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
SEE, THEY KNOW NIGGAS AIN'T
DOWN WITH THAT HOMO BUSINESS.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
NO WOMAN WAKES UP AND SAYS,
"GEE, I HOPE MY MAN DOES

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DEBATE.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
NOW, I GOT SOME PLANS, TOO.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
AND I SAID, "YOU DON'T SCARE ME,
WHITE MAN.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
IT MAY BE TIME TO GIVE HER A
KEY.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU THE MAN I  KNOW  YOU CAN BE.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
THANK GOD FOR THEM, OR I
WOULDN'T HAVE A JOB.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
YOWZA! YOWZA!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
NO, SIR.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
EVERYTHING I TELL HIM TO TODAY."

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
UNCLE RUCKUS, GIVE US YOUR
STRONGEST CRITIQUE OF

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I PLAN TO KEEP YOUR BLACK ASS

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
AND MY NAME AIN'T 'NIGGA.'
YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
COME ONE, COME ALL!

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
BUT AN N-WORD MOMENT, AS YOU PUT
IT, DOES NOT EXCUSE YOU FROM

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE GONNA COME
HARD AFTER YOU -- TO MAKE AN

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
HERE.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Granddad: IS THAT A FULL-SIZE

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
WELCOME TO FREEDOMLAND!

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
EXAMPLE.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
YOU'RE THE MAN, TOM!

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Granddad: WHAT'S THE WORST
THEY CAN DO?

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
SOMETIMES I WANT YOU TO
DOMINATE!

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
>> Granddad: SUMBITCH!

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
'MR. FREEMAN.'"
AMAZING.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
ONE MINUTE.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
COME ON, HOMIE! BENCH!

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
OH, MAMMY!

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
YOU HAVE TO START EATING BETTER

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
OBEYING THE LAW.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
WHAT THEM HOMOS GONNA DO IS
EXTORT YOU -- SHAKE YOU DOWN FOR

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Ruckus: I DON'T NEED A
MINUTE.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
SHAMPOO BOTTLE, NIGGA?!

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
SO IF THIS  IS  AN N-WORD MOMENT,
MR. FREEMAN, MY ADVICE IS, DO

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
TAKE CONTROL!

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
HE'S A BLACK SUMBITCH FROM THE
SWEATY JUNGLES OF KENYA.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
>> Riley: YOU HEARD THAT MAN,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
GET OVER HERE, AL-QAEDA!

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
"DANCING WITH THE STARS"?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
AND TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
IF I'M OUT OF LINE, PUT ME IN
CHECK!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
GRANDDAD.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:53.000 --> 04:53.000
A "DONATION."

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Granddad: EXTORTION?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
WE DON'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO BE

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
STURDY, DID YOU HEAR THIS?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Granddad: I KNOW!

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
NOT BE AN N-WORD.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
OH, YEAH -- EXTORTION!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Tom: SURE, HONEY.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
FEEDING THESE BITCHES.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
NOW THAT I HAVE YOU TO REMIND
ME, IT'LL BE NO PROBLEM!

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
>> Granddad: EVERYTHING'S FINE.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
YES, I DID.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Granddad: HEY!

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Huey: WAIT.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
HE'S GOT MY VOTE.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
WHAT THE HELL?!

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Granddad: WHAT KIND OF JOB IS
THIS?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
OH, GLUTEN-FREE FISH STICKS!

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
YOU  USED TO EXTORT PEOPLE ALL
THE TIME.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Sarah: OHH! TOM!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Huey: EVENTUALLY, GRANDDAD'S
PRIDE GOT THE BEST OF HIM.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
YOUR COURAGE IS AN INSPIRATION,
BROTHER.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Tom: FINE!

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
IT'S JUST ONE DINNER.

04:59.000 --> 04:59.000
WE'RE DRESSED LIKE SLAVES!

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Huey: WE  ARE  SLAVES,
GRANDDAD.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
DAMN SHAME, ISN'T IT?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
NOW, LEADING THIS PARTICULAR
BUS WAS THE

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
THEY STOLE MY WHOLE PLAYBOOK AND
KICKED ME RIGHT OUT THE GAME!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I HEAR YOU!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
>> Riley: HUEY!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Riley: THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT!

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I CAN GET HEALTHY VERSIONS OF
ALL THE CRAP I EAT!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Granddad: OH, HI, GUYS.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
FROM NOW ON, I'LL TAKE CONTROL,
AND I WON'T APOLOGIZE ANYMORE.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Huey:  ONCE NATIONAL NEWS, NOW PUBLIC ACCESS, RUCKUS CONTINUES

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
GRANDDAD'S TAKING BITCHES OUT TO

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
REVEREND STURDY HARRIS, WHO WAS
AN UP-AND-COMING FORCE ON THE

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
MY FEET HURT!

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I USED TO EXTORT THESE CRACKERS
ALL THE TIME.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
EAT AGAIN!

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
ONE OF Y'ALL TAKE ME HOME RIGHT
NOW!

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
WHOA, I CAN'T AFFORD THIS!

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I, UH, GOT INTO A LITTLE
FENDER BENDER.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
EXCEPT, WAIT.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
GOING ON A HOT

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
CIVIL RIGHTS SCENE.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I'M KARDASHIA'S HALF-BROTHER.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
NIGGAS, TOO. I DIDN'T CARE.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
YOU WANTED ME TO STOP
APOLOGIZING, SO I'M SUPPOSED TO

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
HIS SERVICE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Tom: I THINK IT'S GREAT!

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
THEN THE HOMOS CAME ALONG AND
TOOK EVERYTHING OVER.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
STURDY WAS A VERY PHYSICALLY
IMPOSING MAN, A GRAD STUDENT AT

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Granddad: OH. I'M SORRY.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
WE'VE GOT TO GET YOUR FINANCES IN ORDER.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I'M OKAY -- JUST A LITTLE, UH...

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Ruckus: YOU SEE, FELLOW WHITE
AMERICANS, THIS IS WHY I AM

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
ALL THIS FRESH AIR AND SUNSHINE,
AND WHO NEEDS SHOES?!

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
GRANDDAD, YOU GOT YOUR ASS BEAT

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Huey: BUT IT WAS OKAY WHEN YOU  WERE DOING IT?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Granddad: UGH!

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I DIDN'T KNOW THE KARDASHIANS
HAD A BROTHER.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
FISK UNIVERSITY, CAPTAIN OF THE
FOOTBALL TEAM, TOTALLY FEARLESS.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I THINK I CAN HELP YOU,
MR. FREEMAN.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
RIGHT?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
UGH!

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW I
HAD SOME FLOOZY HALF-SISTER WHO

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I EXTORTED FOR THE PEOPLE,
HUEY!

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
YEAH, SO THEN I GUESS I  WILL
APOLOGIZE, THEN...

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
RUNNIN' FOR MAYOR.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Granddad: KISS MY BLACK ASS.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
MY TOES LIKE TO BE FREE.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
HOWEVER, BASED ON THE STATE OF
YOUR FINANCES, IT WOULD BE

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
AGAIN!

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
BLACK FOLKS HAVE EARNED A
FULL-TIME EXTORTIONIST ON  THEIR

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
NOW, BEIN' BLACK IS BAD -- AIN'T
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT -- AND

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
THIS GUY WAS REALLY A SUPERIOR
HUMAN BEING, COMPLETELY

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
AW, DAMN IT.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
WAS GONNA POP UP.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Granddad: WHY ARE  YOU  HERE
ANYWAY?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I MEAN, ANYBODY CAN LOSE ONCE OR
TWICE, BUT GRANDDAD STAY LOSING!

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I'M OUT OF NAP-B-GONE!

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Huey: I HAD TO CALL IN THE

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
UNLIKELY THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY
AFFORD TO HIRE ME.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
SIDE.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
DEDICATED TO THE CAUSE OF
JUSTICE.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Granddad: FAMILY IS A
BLESSING.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Tom: WELL, I HEARD THERE WERE
POSITIONS OPEN IN FREEDOMLAND,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Granddad: WHAT?!

05:16.000 --> 05:16.000
HOMOS AIN'T EARNED THAT YET.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
THEY AIN'T SUFFERED LIKE WE
HAVE.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
SORRY?

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
BEING POOR IS BAD, BUT  THIS
NIGGA HAS THE NERVE TO BE BOTH.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I MIGHT STILL HAVE TIME TO RUN

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
YOU  KNOW  WHAT HAPPENED?!

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Granddad: STURDY.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
NO, IT'S NOT!

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
AND I'M SORT OF A HISTORY BUFF,
IF I MAY SAY SO MYSELF.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
JERRY...

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Riley: DO WE KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED?!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Huey: SO, WE CAN'T PAY THE
"DONATION."

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
GET OUT.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
TO THE STORE.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
BOY, I HATED THAT NIGGA.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I  WAS UP NEXT.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
BUT...

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
>> Riley: NO WAY, GRANDDAD.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
REVEREND STURDY HARRIS.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
NOW MY SHOW'S PUSHED BACK.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
EVERYBODY  KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED!

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
THEN WHAT?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Tom: NOW, HONEY, DON'T DO --
Sarah: GET OUT!

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
BIG GUNS -- SOMEONE WHO LOVED
CAPITALISM AND SMILED AT GIVING

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
BECAUSE YOU'RE A FRIEND OF SIRI,
UH, I'LL TAKE YOU ON PRO BONO.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
THEY GONNA FIND  SOME  WAY TO
GET THAT POUND OF FLESH.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
PAY YOUR BILLS, DEADBEAT NIGGA.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
WE AIN'T GOT NO MONEY FOR WAVE

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Granddad: OW!

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
FINALLY, I HAD A CHANCE TO BE
FAMOUS, TO SPEND NEW YEAR'S IN

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
SO I APPLIED!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I CAUGHT THE LAST HALF OF IT ON
THE LIVE STREAM!

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Granddad: RUCKUS, I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
GEL.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Riley: WHO APPLIES TO BE A
SLAVE?

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I'M TELLING YOU, YOUR BEST
CHANCE IS TO STICK WITH ME.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Tom: OW!

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
WYOU AIN'T GOT ENOUGH HAIR TOE

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
AWAY THE BULK OF HIS FREE DAY TO
THE MAN.

05:24.000 --> 05:24.000
SO, WHERE YOU FROM?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Granddad: WHAT'S NEXT, SIRI?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Granddad: OH, NO! WHY ME?!

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Riley: AW, MAN, HERE HE COME!

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
WORRY ABOUT, NOWAY.

05:25.000 --> 05:25.000

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
SO, WHERE IS MR. FREEMAN
TRAVELING TO?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
OH, MAN, MY FEET HURT SO BAD.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
YOU HAVE A CHECKERS GAME WITH

WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Tom: HEY, HUEY.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
VEGAS INSTEAD OF GOING ON SOME
DATE WITH AN AUTISTIC TEEN MOM.

05:26.000 --> 05:26.000
WHY?!

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Huey: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I KNOW THIS WHOLE GAME INSIDE
AND OUT.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Riley: MM-HMM.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Ruckus: QUESTION IS, ROBERT,
WHAT ARE  YOU  DOIN' HERE...

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
Granddad: OH, HEADING BACK TO
CHICAGO.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Tom: OH, TOUGHEN UP, RILEY.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
UNCLE RUCKUS IN THE PARK IN 15 MINUTES.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
HOW DOES HE KEEP COMING BACK?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Granddad: HUEY, ELECTRONICS!

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I CAME OVER AS SOON AS I PAID MY
TAXES.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
THEM HOMOS CAN'T GET NOTHIN'
OVER ON ME!

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO
GO BACK TO A NOBLE TIME FOR

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Granddad: HE SAID HE WAS A
CLONE.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
HERE IN THE WHITE MAN'S HOUSE
THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Granddad: I ALMOST FORGOT!

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Huey: AND WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I'M TIRED OF THAT HENPECKED
SIMP COMING OVER HERE EVERY TIME

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
WHOA.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
DAMN THAT
MAKE-A-WISH FOUNDATION!

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Huey: A CLONE?!

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
NIGGA, I JUST NEED ATTENTION.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
WHO PEED IN YOUR PETUNIAS,
ROBERT?

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Ruckus: WHAT -- EIGHT GAMES

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Granddad: I KNOW!

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
SHE THROWS HIM OUT, SCREAMING
LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
OH, WHAT, WHAT, YOU THOUGHT YOU
COULD PAY YOUR MORTGAGE WITH

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Granddad: STUPID HUEY HAD
THIS GREAT IDEA THAT A JOB COULD

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
UM, ROBERT, THIS BUS IS GOING
SOUTH.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
BLACK AMERICANS -- WHEN WE
OVERCAME OBSTACLES AND STRUGGLED

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
WHEN DID THEY START CLONING
PEOPLE?!

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
THEY CANCELED MY SITCOM.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Granddad: SORRY.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
THIS TIME, HE CAN SLEEP IN THE
YARD.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Granddad: HUH?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
THE ONLY REASON CHICKS BANG
ME IS TO GET TO MY SISTERS.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
I WATCH THE NEWS!

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I'M MOONLIGHTING FOR PETA, FOR
CRYING OUT LOUD!

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
FOOD STAMPS, NIGGA?

05:36.000 --> 05:36.000
>> Granddad: AHH.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
HELP WITH MONEY PROBLEMS.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
TO BE THE FREE, FULLY REALIZED
HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.000
IN A ROW?!

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
NIGGA, YOU MUST BE CHEATING!

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
BRIAN WILLIAMS NEVER SAID
NOTHING ABOUT NO HUMAN CLONING!

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO
CLEARLY SEE THE SUSPECT'S FACE,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
LOOK, YOU FAT, ONE-EYED BASTARD!

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
PRETTY BOY. PLAYER.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
TO DO SINCE
TRAYVON MARTIN.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Huey: HOW IS IT MY FAULT YOU
GOT FIRED?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOING NORTH.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
MAN, I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THE
RIGHT HOMIE TO HELP ME GET MY

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
AUTHORITIES HA--

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
OH, NO.

GOD BLESS AMERICA!

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
GOD DAMN IT!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Riley: MAN, ONE OF YOUR
FIGHTS GOT A TOTAL OF SEVEN

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
THANK GOD THEY STILL SHOOT
NIGGAS, OR I WOULDN'T EVEN BE

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Granddad: IT'S YOUR FAULT I
TRIED.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Tom: PLEASE.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
TRYING TO GET A JOB IS THE FIRST
STEP TO LOSING A JOB.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
YOU MUST HAVE GOTTEN ON THE
WRONG BUS.

BUT I HAD MONEY, AND AS LONG AS

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
WE'RE JUST LIKE YOU, ROBERT.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
JEALOUS OF WHAT?

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Riley: OOH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
AN AWESOME PLAN THAT CAN'T GO

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
GOT BIG LAWYERS ON THE CASE.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
WHY BE JEALOUS WHEN I CAN DO
THIS?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE STILL
IN THE BIZ.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
SAY WHAT'S UP TO TOM DuBOIS.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
SHOW THAT BUILDS HOUSES FOR POOR
PEOPLE.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I HAD MONEY, I COULD HAVE A

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
WE FELT LIKE IT WAS TIME TO TAKE
A STAND.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
RICH PATRONS FEEL BAD FOR NOT
VOTING FOR UNIVERSAL

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
YOU ALMOST MADE ME FEEL BAD
ABOUT CUSSING OUT THAT GUY AT

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
AREN'T YOU A SITCOM ACTOR NOW?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
MODERATELY SATISFYING SEX LIFE.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
HUH?

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Tom: FLIZZY, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO TURN IT OFF, NOW.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
THIS BUS IS GOING TO FREEDOM.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
WRONG, GRANDDAD!

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
A B.E.T.-AWARD-NOMINATED
SITCOM ACTOR, THANK YOU.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Granddad: THEN WE GOT TO TURN
THIS BUS AROUND.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
HEALTHCARE.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
THE APPLE STORE.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD TUNE IN
JUST TO SEE YOU DIE!

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
>> Riley: UGH.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
SERIOUSLY, I AM LIKE A HUGE
BUSINESS PERSON, OKAY?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Granddad: RUCKUS, YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND!

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
AIN'T GONNA LET
NOBODY TURN ME AROUND

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
BUT NOT REALLY 'CAUSE HE WAS A
DICK.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, ISN'T THAT
EXACTLY WHAT WE DID THE FIRST

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
WELL, ROLLO, I'M NOT HERE TO
START ANY TROUBLE.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
KILL THE CAMERA, B.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
>> Granddad: NO MORE.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
AAH!

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Tom: I ALSO THINK THESE
PEOPLE SHOULD LEAVE.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
FREEMAN.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
MNH-MNH! DON'T CLAP.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Ruckus: BOY, THE SOUND OF
THAT WHIP SURE IS SWEET.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
TIME THIS HAPPENED?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I'M A BUSINESSWOMAN AND, LIKE,
THIS WHOLE THING, I CAN'T EVEN

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Granddad: YEAH.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
UNLIKE YOU, I DON'T HATE.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
"THESE PEOPLE?"
YOU MEAN "THESE PEOPLE?"

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I'M TIRED OF THIS LAWYER COMING
IN AND JUST SINGING.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Huey: AND YOU ENDED UP
KILLING HIM.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Granddad: EXCUSE ME FOR A
SECOND.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
IT'S LIKE JESUS GENTLY SNAPPING
HIS FINGERS.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
SLEEP TIGHT, ROBERT.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Granddad: YEAH. SEE?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
I MEDIATE.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Tom: I MEAN THESE PEOPLE.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
IT'S ME -- ED WUNCLER JR.
Granddad: OH. HUH?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
GOOGLE MYSELF, BECAUSE, LIKE,
TOO MANY HITS COME UP, OKAY?

06:47.000 --> 06:47.000
SEE?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
RHYMING -- THAT'S  MY  THING!

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
CAN'T AN OLD BITCH GET SOME FREE
LEGAL ADVICE, SOME ESTATE

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
THE PLAN WORKED.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
YOU MEAN  MY  PEOPLE, NIGGA!

06:49.000 --> 06:49.000
YOU WITH THEM?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
NO.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
NOW, ROBERT AND TOM, YOU HAVE
GOOD WHITE-MAN NAMES, SO WE WILL

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I DID IT ONCE.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
AS I SAID ON THE PHONE,
YES-HOMO IS AN ORGANIZATION OF

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Granddad: WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS FOR?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
YOU'RE A STUPID JERK.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I CAN DO IT AGAIN BECAUSE I
BELIEVE IN MYSELF.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
THESE  MY  PEOPLE.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
YEAH, WE NEVER MET, BUT MY
FATHER TALKS ABOUT YOU SO MUCH,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
PLANNING, AN ADVANCE DIRECTIVE?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
TIME AND A HALF.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY TO ME YOU
CAN SAY IN FRONT OF THEM.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Granddad: CAN I PAY YOU
DOUBLE TO TURN THE BUS AROUND?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I'M A DANCER. THAT'S RIGHT --
A PROFESSIONAL DANCER.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
GOOD MORNING, ROBERT.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Huey: NO, GRANDDAD, MY POINT
IS --

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Granddad:

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
LEAVE YOUR NAMES BE.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
YOUR NEW FINANCIAL MANAGER WOULD LIKE YOU TO CHECK YOUR

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Granddad: LESS TALK, MORE
TRAINING!

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
LGBT UNITY, AND --
Granddad: "L-G-B-T"?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
IF ANYTHING, NIGGA, YOU THE
STRANGER HERE.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
NO, SIR.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I POP AND LOCK.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
DAD TURNED OVER THE PROPERTY
MANAGEMENT TO ME.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
YEAH, IT DOES SEEM LIKE A WASTE.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
All:

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
I POP AND LOCK.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
BUT YOU TWO LITTLE NIGGAS, OH,
YOU HAVE AGGRESSIVE NAMES AND AS

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
ACCOUNT BALANCE.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
LET'S GO!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
SCREW YOU!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Tom: IT'S MY OFFICE.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I'M GERALDINE.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
YOU'RE ONLY HALF-KARDASHIAN.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Granddad: SURE.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Huey: THE MORE YOU FIGHT, THE
MORE  HE  FIGHTS.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Riley: IT MEANS "LETTUCE,
GAY, BACON, AND TOMATO,"

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
OKAY, THEN, SO WHAT'S THE BIG
SECRET THAT YOU CAN'T

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Riley: WHOA.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Granddad: ROBERT.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
YOU'RE ED THE THIRD'S DAD?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
PLEASED TO MAKE YOUR
ACQUAINTANCE.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
LOOK, ROBERT.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM ANYWAY?!

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
SUCH, THEY WILL BE CHANGED!

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
WHOA! THAT'S...

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
GRANDDAD.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
TELL ME IN FRONT OF MY FANS AND
MY PEOPLE?

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Granddad: WELL, UH...IT'S A
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
IT'S  YOUR  EGO, GRANDDAD.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
MM. ROBERT, HUH?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY TO
YOU, BUT WE DO HAVE A STRATEGY.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
YOU'RE  THE PROBLEM.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
IT MEANS "LESBIAN, GAY,
BISEXUAL, AND TRANSGENDER" --

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
WHY IS THIS MY FIRST TIME SEEING
YOU?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Both: WHOA!

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
HUEY, YOU ARE NOW "NIGGA ONE" OR
"ONE" FOR SHORT.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Granddad: I'M RISING TO THE
CHALLENGE, REDEEMING MY HONOR!

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MATTER OF FACT, WHY AM I EVEN
HERE?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MR. WUNCLER THE SECOND.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
THE PEOPLE YOU SO CALLOUSLY --
Riley: WHAT'S "BISEXUAL"?

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Tom: YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR CRIMINAL CASE.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
CALL ME EDDIE.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
WHAT FLOOR YOU LIVE ON?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Granddad: SIT STILL ON THE
DAMN COUCH!

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Huey: THAT'S A NICE WAY TO
SAY YOU WANT PAYBACK.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
CAN I COME IN?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Granddad: STRATEGY?

07:05.000 --> 07:05.000
WHAT?!

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
HOW DID HE DO THAT?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Granddad: OH, I DON'T LIVE
HERE.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
A BRILLIANT STRATEGY.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Riley: IT'S NOT ME!

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Granddad: THAT'S WHEN THEY GO
BOTH WAYS.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Granddad: THANK GOD.

07:07.000 --> 07:07.000
IT'S HUEY!

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
RILEY, YOUR NAME IS "NIGGA TWO"
OR "TWO" FOR SHORT.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
WITH ME IN YOUR LIFE, ALL

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF A NIGGA?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I HAVE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ME.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT
BEFORE.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Huey: IT'S HER!

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Granddad: I DON'T KNOW.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Tom: I REVIEWED THE CASE, AND
I'VE WATCHED THE SECURITY

07:09.000 --> 07:09.000
IT'S HER BUTT!

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
LOOK HOW BIG IT GOT! IT'S FAKE!

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
SORTS OF GOOD THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Huey: THINK ABOUT IT.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Riley: OH, MAN! THAT'S GROSS!

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN -- SEEMS
LIKE A LOVELY PLACE.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I LOVE STRATEGY.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
LAY IT ON ME.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
TWO, TOTE THAT BALE OF HAY TO MY
HORSE, WHO I HAVE AFFECTIONATELY

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
YOU MEAN LIKE THEY KISS A GIRL,
THEN KISS A DUDE, THEN KISS A

07:12.000 --> 07:12.000
FOOTAGE.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
COOL. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
OH, MY GOODNESS. LOOK AT THIS.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
THE MOST BRILLIANT STRATEGY
EVER CONCEIVED -- NONVIOLENT

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Granddad: I LOVE YOU, SIRI.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Granddad: MR. ROGERS?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Tom: ALL RIGHT, JOKE TIME.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
WOW, NO ONE'S EVER SAID THAT

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Huey: PERFECT.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
GIRL, THEN KISS A DUDE?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
CAN YOU GET ME OFF?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
WHAT A LOVELY HOME.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
IS THIS THING ON? NO?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
NAMED "NIGGER."

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
CAN YOU IMAGINE MR. ROGERS IN A
NIGGA MOMENT?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Granddad: MM-HMM.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Tom: DID YOU ROB THE LIQUOR
STORE, FLIZZY?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
WELL, DID YOU TRY IT?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
DIRECT ACTION.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
HUEY'S BUTT ACCUSATION -- IT
REALLY HURT ME.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
EVEN THOUGH HE IS WHITE, HE HAS
WIDE NOSTRILS.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
TO ME BEFORE.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
THE COUCH IS...UH, BEAUTIFUL,
WITH THE...THE CARPET.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Granddad: COME AGAIN?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
...THE PEOPLE YOU SO
CALLOUSLY OFFENDED WITH YOUR

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
I CAN'T SAY THAT...I DID IT,
BUT, HONESTLY, REALLY CAN'T SAY

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
ALL RIGHT.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
YOU CONFRONT THE OPPRESSOR
AND HIS UNJUST SYSTEM.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
SO I DECIDED TO BE THE STRONG,
TOUGH WOMAN I AM AND GIVE HIM A

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Granddad: OF COURSE NOT!

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S INVISIBLE AND
SMELLS LIKE STRAWBERRIES?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
Riley: OLD NIGGER GONNA DIE
TODAY 'CAUSE HE AIN'T GETTIN'

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
OH, I-I'M SORRY.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
INCITE HIM TO VIOLENCE WITHOUT
RESORTING TO VIOLENCE YOURSELF.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Riley: COME ON, HUEY, LOOK AT
THIS!

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Huey: SO TO END A NIGGA
MOMENT, YOU HAVE TO BE

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
HATEFUL WORDS.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
THIS IS MY ASSISTANT,
VANDERBILT.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
PIECE OF MY MIND.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
JACK.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
HOW CAN YOU HATE ON THIS,
REALLY?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
MR. ROGERS, AND WHAT WOULD
MR. ROGERS DO?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
USING THE TERM "GAY" WHEN YOU
MEAN SOMETHING IS STUPID OR

07:22.000 --> 07:22.000
F'SHO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Tom: AND WHY CAN'T YOU SAY
"F'SHO"?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
YOU DO HAVE A LOVELY HOME.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
MY FARTS AFTER I DRINK
ENSURE.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Granddad: WHY WOULD WE DO
THAT?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Tom: RUCKUS, THIS IS
INHUMANE!

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
WE'RE GONNA BE

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
TO PROVE OUR MORAL
SUPERIORITY.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Ruckus: WHO THE HELL SAID
THAT NIGGAS WAS HUMAN IN THE

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
EVEN  YOU  CAN'T HATE ON THIS!

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Granddad: I'M SORRY, BABY.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, THIS CAN'T BE
LEGAL.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
HE WOULD FOLLOW NORMAL
WHITE-PEOPLE RULES.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
DUMB, THAT'S OFFENSIVE.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
UP!

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I  used to have a lovely home.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
RICH.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Tom: WHAT?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Granddad: SO, WE MAKE THEM
WANT TO ATTACK US?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
FIRST PLACE?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Riley: I DIDN'T SAY "GAY" TO
MEAN "STUPID"  OR  "DUMB."

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Tom: AND HOW ABOUT THESE --
HOW ABOUT YOUR ENTOURAGE?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE...

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
>> Tom: YEAH, MY HAIR'S SO SILKY

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
NO. EW. ICK. GROSS.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
ONE, GET NIGGER SOME CARROTS!

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Granddad: YES, IT IS!

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
SO IF STINKMEANER CONFRONTED
MR. ROGERS IN A PARKING

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
SMOOTH.

07:27.000 --> 07:27.000
YES.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
IT'S MY NEW BUSINESS MANAGER.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
MM-HMM? HMM.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
>> Riley: I LIKE YOUR HAIR.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Granddad: AND THEN WE LET
THEM?

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Granddad: APOLOGIZE!

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Huey: A BUSINESS MANAGER
CAN'T MAKE MONEY APPEAR IN YOUR

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
LOT...

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
I SAID "GAY" TO MEAN "GAY."

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
DO THEY KNOW ANYTHING?

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
IT'S LIKE YOU KIND OF GOT THAT

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
THAT IS NO-- GAH.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
EXACTLY.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Granddad: OH, YEAH, HE
WOULDN'T FIGHT.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
MY GRANDDAD ALWAYS TOLD ME
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
UP, TOO!

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
J. LO THING GOING ON -- YOU

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
NO, THAT'S --
THAT'S NOT THE PUNCH--

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Granddad: AND WE DON'T FIGHT
BACK?

07:30.000 --> 07:30.000
UH-OH.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
ONE, IS YOU DEFYING ME, BOY?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
HEY, MAN, WHEN WE GO OUT, WE GO
HARD.

07:31.000 --> 07:31.000
SO, LOOK.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
KNOW, KIND OF LIKE THE WHITE

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
NO.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
BANK ACCOUNT.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
HE WOULD WALK AWAY AND CALL THE
POLICE.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
GIRLS.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
OH, GOD.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Granddad: WHAT ABOUT
SELF-DEFENSE?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
WE HAVE NO MONEY!

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Granddad: THAT'S A DAMN LIE.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
COMPLICATED IT IS BEING ME.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
IT SMELLS LIKE STRAWBERRIES IN
HERE NOW.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Huey: SORRY.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Granddad: HUEY, YOU BETTER
LISTEN TO THIS FOOL BEFORE HE

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Granddad: WELL, THANKS TO
SIRI, WE DO NOW.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Huey: AND IF HE KEEPS
COMING BACK?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I NEVER TOLD HIM TO TELL THE
TRUTH.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY WHERE I NEED
TO BE WITH THE HOUSE.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
THE ONLY SELF-DEFENSE ALLOWED IS
SINGING AND A SPECIAL KIND OF

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Granddad: FILE A COMPLAINT,
GET A RESTRAINING ORDER.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
IT'S PRETTY HOT.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS. COME ON.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
YOU'RE TAKING THEIR SIDE!

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
HITS YOU WITH THAT WHIP.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO THINK
POSITIVE.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I ALWAYS TAUGHT MY KIDS -- THE
PROPER WAY TO RESPECT PEOPLE OF

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
ALL THE TIME I
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I SAID.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
>> Jazmine: I'M THE MOST

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
IT'LL BE MORE FUN THAN THIS.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
NONVIOLENT MARTIAL ART WHICH
PROTECTS YOUR ATTACKER AT ALL

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
YOU'RE NEVER ON MY SIDE!

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, I'M NOBODY'S
PROPERTY, AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Riley: NIGGA, IT'S FREE
MONEY!

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
EVENTUALLY, THEY WOULD PUT
STINKMEANER IN JAIL.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Tom: HOW?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
HOW CAN YOU HATE ON FREE MONEY?!

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
HOMOEROTIC DESCENT IS TO LIE AND
PRETEND THEY DON'T EXIST.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
'CAUSE I GOT LIKE 18 PEOPLE
TWEETING FOR ME AT ONE TIME.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Ruckus: DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHEN HE SIGNED HIS FREEDOM AWAY

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Riley: BUT THEN HE HAS TO
SNITCH, AND THEN I GOT TO LIVE

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Granddad: YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU, ROBERT!

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
TIMES -- "HARD CHIN, SOFT HAND."

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Granddad: OH SIRI, IF ONLY I

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
LOOK, I'M JUST HERE TO GET
YOU THE  OUT.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Granddad: IF THESE CAMERAS
WEREN'T ON, I'D BEAT YOU SO BAD,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
MR. FREEMAN, NOW THAT YOU'VE
HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
UP!

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
THIS IS GONNA REVOLUTIONIZE THE

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
TO MR. EDDIE?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
COULD FIND A REAL WOMAN JUST AS
AMAZING AS YOU.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
WITH THAT SHAME!

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
SO, LIKE, I LOOK AT THE TAPE AND
I SAY, "IS IT ME, OR IS IT

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
WHOLE BLACK-HAIR-CARE INDUSTRY.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Granddad: DO YOU EVEN HEAR
YOURSELVES?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
SHOOT, YOU NIGGAS SHOULD BE
GRATEFUL YOU NOT WORKING AT

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Granddad: YES, DUMB IDEA,
HUEY.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
CERTAINLY, THERE'S SOMEONE IN

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
STINKMEANER GET AWAY WITH
BEATING ME IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
SERIOUSNESS OF WHAT YOUR
GRANDSON HAS DONE, I'M SURE

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
YOU'RE SITTING ON A GOLD MINE.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
WE ARE READY FOR ANYTHING,
ROBERT.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
YOU'D LOOK LIKE IMPRESSIONIST
ART.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
SOMEONE I JUST PAID TO ROB A
LIQUOR STORE WHO LOOKS JUST LIKE

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
AAH!

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
SUB-SAHARAN FOOD BANK LAND.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
YOUR LIFE  JUST  LIKE ME YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
>> Granddad: OH, THANK YOU,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
THEY CAN ARREST US, BEAT US.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
OH, SO YOU DID LIKE THE MONET

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I NEVER GET REDEMPTION!

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
YOU'D AGREE THAT THE BEST WAY TO
MAKE AMENDS WITH THE LGBT

07:48.000 --> 07:48.000
JESUS.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
>> Granddad: OH, THANK YOU,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Granddad: OHH!

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Granddad: BEAT US?

07:48.000 --> 07:48.000
TOM!

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Tom: YES, RUCKUS?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Granddad: WELL, I HAVEN'T
FOUND HER.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Huey: BUT IT ENDS.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
ME?"
I DON'T KNOW.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
BELIEVE IN YOU, IT WOULD PAY OFF

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I THINK, AS A PEOPLE, WE'VE
TAKEN ENOUGH BEATINGS.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
PAINTING I SENT YOU.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Granddad: YOU'RE SAYING THAT
I SHOULD JUST LET HIM GET AWAY

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
SOMEDAY.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
HEY, WHAT THE --
OKAY, SPREAD 'EM! SPREAD 'EM!

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
I TOLD YOU!

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Ruckus: FROM NOW ON, MY NAME
IS NOT RUCKUS.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
YOU DON'T KNOW THE KIND OF BAD
LUCK I'VE HAD WITH WOMEN.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
COMMUNITY IS A DONATION TO
SUPPORT THE FINE WORK WE DO AT

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Tom: OKAY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
UP FRONT THAT I HAVE SERIOUS

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
OH, YOU SHOULDA
SEEN YOUR FACE.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
>> Tom: SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
DON'T YOU THINK?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
WITH BEATING ME IN FRONT OF THE
WHOLE  WORLD?!

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
>> Riley: YEAH, HOW DO WE GET

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
YOU KNOW THE DEAL.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
BEAT US, STAB US, SIC DOGS ON
US, LIGHT US ON FIRE.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
IT IS BOSS!

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
ISSUES WITH SOME OF YOUR
BEHAVIOR IN THE PAST, ESPECIALLY

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
PAID?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
MM. MM! OOH!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Granddad: TAKE YOUR ASS
OUTSIDE!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Tom:

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
NO, I'VE GIVEN UP.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Huey: IF YOU WANT THIS TO
FINALLY END,  YES.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
YES-HOMO.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
ROBERT, IT'S ME.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
>> Ril>> Granddad: UH...E GET

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
I BELIEVE I CAN HELP.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
WHAT'D I TELL YOU, HUH?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
IT'S YOUR NEPHEW, EDDIE.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
>> Tom: NOW, NOW.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Granddad: UGH!

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Granddad: LIGHT US ON FIRE?!

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
Granddad: YOU TOO!

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
JUST TELL ME WHAT KIND OF WOMEN YOU LIKE.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Granddad: NO, I CAN'T DO
THAT.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
HITTING A WOMAN.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I'D NEVER KICK YOU OUT OF HERE.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
THERE'S A LOT THAT HAS TO BE

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
HE'S CLEAN!

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
NOT THAT WE'RE EXPECTING
THAT.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Ruckus: YOU TOUGH, HUH?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME!

07:57.000 --> 07:57.000
B-BUT WAIT.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I KNEW YOU WAS GONNA SAY THAT.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
DONE BEFORE YOU CAN BRING

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I'LL FIND AND CONTACT THEM VIA E-MAIL AND RUN THEM PAST YOU

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I GOT PRIDE. I'M STRONG.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
THESE PEOPLE GOT NO MONEY AND
NO REPUTATION TO RUIN!

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT,
THOUGH?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO MARKET.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
BUT WE ARE PREPARED FOR THAT
TO HAPPEN.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
WELL, WE GOT WAYS OF DEALING
WITH YOUR TYPE.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
POCKET CHANGE.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
YOU NEED A BUSINESS PLAN,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
NO WOMAN WANTS A MAN WHO FILES
A RESTRAINING ORDER IN THE FACE

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Tom: NO, I DON'T --
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
LAWYERS, DISTRIBUTION.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
ROBERT, COME. HAVE A SEAT.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Granddad: YOU CAN'T GET
PREPARED TO GET LIT ON FIRE!

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
FOR SCREENING AND APPROVAL.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Granddad: SORRY.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
DON'T NEED THAT.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Huey: MAN, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH HER?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
THOUGH?

08:02.000 --> 08:02.000
HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS STUFF DO

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
YOU HAVE?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
IN DEFENSE OF ROBERT, THE
STRATEGY OF NONVIOLENT DIRECT

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
YOU CAN MEET THEM AT YOUR LEISURE.

08:02.000 --> 08:02.000
OF DANGER.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I WANT AN ERECTION!

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
DONATIONS ARE SO...IMPERSONAL.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Tom: NO, FLIZZY, THERE'S --
CAN I TELL YOU MY SIDE OF IT

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
HEY, YOU CHECK FOR HOLLOWED-OUT
SPACES, EH?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
>> Granddad: I'M NOT SURE.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Granddad: YOU WOULD DO THAT
FOR ME?!

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
YOU REMEMBER THOSE
NUNS WAS TRYIN' TO HIDE

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I GOT IT FROM HUEY.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
ACTION, WHEN YOU ACTUALLY THINK
ABOUT IT, IS COMPLETELY INSANE.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Huey:  IN MODERN AMERICA, WHO WOULD BELIEVE PEOPLE WOULD WANT

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Huey: HOW MANY TIMES IN LIFE
DO YOU GET A SECOND CHANCE,

08:05.000 --> 08:05.000
THOUGH?!

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Tom: FINE! WHAT?!

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
>> Tom: WELL, WHERE DID HE GET

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
SO, ROBERT, WHAT BROUGHT YOU
HERE TODAY?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Riley: I DON'T KNOW.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
OF COURSE.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
I THINK IT MEANS SO MUCH MORE
WHEN WE...GIVE OF  OURSELVES.

08:06.000 --> 08:06.000
IT FROM?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
>> Huey: HEY, GRANDDAD.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Huey: HER BUTT KEEPS GETTING
BIGGER.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Granddad: OKAY.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
THE THORNY CROWN IN THE WALL?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
TO BE ENTERTAINED BY SLAVES?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
DO YOU NEED MY PASSWORDS?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
GRANDDAD?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
UP!

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
SISTERS RIGHT THERE.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT CONTAINER OF

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Granddad: AM I ABOUT TO GET
JUMPED INTO SOME GRAY PANTHERS

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
YOU HAVE TO TRUST US, ROBERT.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I ALREADY HAVE THEM.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
A CHANCE TO FIX YOUR BIGGEST
MISTAKE?

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Riley: HEY, MAN, WHY YOU
STEALIN' OUR STUFF?!

08:09.000 --> 08:09.000
PINK GEL I WAS --

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
>> Granddad: HEY, HUEY.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
ON YOUR MARKS, GET SET...

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Granddad: FINE!

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
HOW MUCH MORE OF THAT WAVE CREAM

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
GOD IS ON OUR SIDE.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Riley: I DON'T CARE.

08:10.000 --> 08:10.000
Granddad: HUH?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I'VE BEEN CORRESPONDING WITH

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000

IT'S JAIL.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA
DO AT THE NEXT STATION.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
IT SEEMS KIND OF CRAZY.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND FOR A

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
THAT'S RIGHT -- JAIL, A JAIL

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE
SOMETIMES, I GUESS.

08:27.000 --> 08:27.000

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
NOBODY EVER CALLS ME ON SKYPE!

Ruckus: HEY, RICH, MOSTLY

SERIOUSLY, ONE MORE SCENE OF
JUST DRIVING THAT HEIFER TO

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Riley: I'M JUST GONNA GO
AHEAD FOR THE RECORD AND SAY A

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Sarah: HE MADE A LITTLE TINY
MISTAKE.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Granddad: WAIT.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
DOES EVERYBODY ENJOY

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
COME UP WITH SOME DUMBASS PLANS.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
YOU MEAN RUCKUS WAS AT THE
BIRMINGHAM STATION?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
SO, HERE I AM.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Bitch-ass!

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Tom: I GUESS HITTING A WOMAN
IS OKAY IF YOU HAVE ABS,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Nothing is going to be okay.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WHORES,
ROBERT?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
WATERBOARDING?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
You's a bitch-ass nigga!

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
"NO, HOMO" OVER THIS WHOLE
CONVERSATION.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Listen to me.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
NOW, HOW MUCH OF THAT BOMB WAVE

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
ALL THIS TIME, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I KNOW IT'S NOT 19th CENTURY,

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Fake your deaths.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
CREAM DO YOU HAVE?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, rock with me, Robert!

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
O...KAY.

09:04.000 --> 09:04.000
IS THAT IT?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Sarah: HE'S A TALENTED
ARTIST.

09:04.000 --> 09:04.000
Do you hear me?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Granddad: LOVE 'EM.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
THAT BLACK SUMBITCH!

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
WELL, THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO
START, BUT HERE, WE DON'T SAY

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Fake...your...deaths.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
>> Riley: HEY, THAT SHOULD BE

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
GOOD. LET ME BACK UP A BIT.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
BOY, I'MA HAVE TO KICK HIS ASS
WHEN I SEE HIM.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
BUT IT'S JUST SO MUCH FUN.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Come on!

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Tom: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, OKAY.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
THE NAME -- "BOMB WAVE CREAM."

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
KNOW WHY WE'RE BROKE, ROBERT?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
IS ILLEGAL.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
I APOLOGIZE, ROBERT.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
SLOW DOWN.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Ruckus: ROBERT FREEMAN WAS
THERE?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
EH, NOT REALLY.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Huey:  IN ORDER TO KEEP RUCKUS' WHIP OFF MY GRANDAD'S

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I'M AFRAID THAT WASN'T AS FRUITFUL AS I HAD HOPED.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
"FLUID SWAP"?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
>> Granddad: GOOD IDEA.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
BECAUSE OUR GENERATION RAISED
NO-GOOD, SELFISH-ASS SONS.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
I'M PUTTING USED JELL-O SHOTS
AND PETROLEUM IN YOUR ASS.

09:08.000 --> 09:08.000
"NO, HOMO."

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
WE SAY "YES-HOMO"!

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
"RUB AGAINST MY ERECTION"?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
WELL, AIN'T THAT SOMETHING?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
THE FIRST WAS A TERMINAL BORE, THE SECOND A NARCISSISTIC HAG,

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
WRITE IT DOWN BEFORE WE FORGET.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
BACK, EVEN  I  WAS FORCED TO COOPERATE.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Granddad: SOMETHING'S WRONG.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
LET'S TRY IT.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH"?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
>> Huey: DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I ASKED MY SON TO VISIT ME.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP UP
WITH THE KARDASHIANS!

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
THAT CAVE...

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Riley: WHATEVER, NIGGA.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
ONE SPARK, AND HEADS COULD

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
SMALL WORLD.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
THE THIRD HAD BODY ODOR SO BAD
I  COULD SMELL IT, AND THE LAST

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
"NO HOMO" OVER THIS WHOLE
CONVERSATION.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I LOVE
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
HE SAID, "I'M BUSY, MAMA."

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
BULL CONNOR MADE AN
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
IT WAS A VERY LONG DAY.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I FEEL COLD.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
ACTUALLY EXPLODE.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
YEAH, NIGGA WAS BUSY, ALL
RIGHT -- SNATCHIN' A PURSE.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
OKAY, HOW ABOUT A GAME-SHOW

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
THAT PLACE -- IT IS STRONG
WITH THE DARK SIDE.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
RIGHT. RIGHT.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
OH, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET
HIM TO SING AT JAZMINE'S

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
>> Riley: "BOMB WAVE CREAM -- AN

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
KU KLUX KLAN.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Ruckus: PAY NO ATTENTION TO
THE BALLOON.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
ONE HAD THAT GOD-AWFUL LAUGH.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
THEIR MOBS WOULD BE ALLOWED 15
MINUTES TO DO ANYTHING TO THE

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
IT WON'T INFLATE.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Granddad: OH, COME ON.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Huey:  THE SECOND DEMAND WAS THAT RILEY APPEAR IN A YES-HOMO

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
EXPLOSIONOF BEAUTIFUL HAIR."  ■

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
THAT'S JUST TO GIVE THE GAME A
SENSE OF FUN.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
THEY WEREN'T THAT BAD.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
MM, A DOMAIN OF EVIL, IT IS.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
BIRTHDAY?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
>> Granddad: OHH.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
I'M TELLING YOU, EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF OUR BOYS AGE 30 TO 50 --

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
NOW, IF YOU WILL ALL REACH UNDER
YOUR CHAIRS, YOU'LL FIND WATER

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
IN YOU MUST GO.

09:19.000 --> 09:19.000
Tom: NO! DO YOU LET HER
LISTEN TO THAT?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Granddad: WHAT'S IN THERE?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
PSA ADVOCATING TOLERANCE.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Sarah: OUR PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN
ROUGH ON HER.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I LIKE THAT.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
RIDERS WITHOUT FEAR OF ARREST.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
ROBERT, NONE OF THOSE WOMEN WERE WORTH YOUR TIME.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD, YOU'RE GONNA

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
IDEA?

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
ONLY WHAT YOU TAKE WITH YOU.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
OKAY, PEOPLE, WE ARE GOING IN
FIVE.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
IT WOULD BE NICE TO, YOU KNOW...

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
HUH?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
KILL PEOPLE.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
THEY'RE STUCK ON STUPID AND
FASTENED TO -UP.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Ruckus: OH, SURE.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
"BOXERS OR BRIEFS."

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
CANNONS.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Granddad: SIRI, I LIKED THE
SECOND ONE OKAY.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
>> Granddad: WE'LL PUT A WARNING

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
IT STARTS WITH BUSES.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
IF THE CONTESTANT GUESSES WRONG,
THEY HAVE TO SLEEP WITH

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
"GAY PSA," TAKE 1.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
WHAT?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
GOT IT!

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
FREEMAN.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
LABEL ON IT -- "WARNING,

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
BUT NEXT THEY WILL WANT TO
INTEGRATE SCHOOLS AND

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
AW, YEAH!

09:25.000 --> 09:25.000
SHE WASN'T BAD.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I'D LIKE TO TAKE HER OUT TO
DINNER.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
YOUR WEAPONS -- YOU WILL NOT
NEED THEM.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Riley: SO, THE NEXT TIME YOU
SAY "GAY" TO REFER TO SOMETHING

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Tom: DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
FLAMMABLE."

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
AN OLD-SCHOOL MAN LIKE YOU
YOUNG LADIES WOULD

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
EVERYONE.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
MORAL DILEMMA SOLVED.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
Granddad: YOU KNOW, IT'S
NEVER BAD TO HAVE TWO IDEAS WHEN

09:27.000 --> 09:27.000
Both: HUH?

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Ruckus: READY, AIM, SHOOT!

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
ROBERT, I KNOW YOU'RE

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Sarah: WHAT?

MY NIGGER.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
RESTAURANTS, AND BEFORE YOU
KNOW, SOME NIGGA WILL WANT TO

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
THAT'S GAY, DON'T, BECAUSE --

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Tom: THIS ISN'T ABOUT
JAZMINE.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
CAN I SAY THAT? YES, I CAN.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
REALLY APPRECIATE.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
DESPERATE BUT HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Granddad: YEAH, WHATEVER.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Granddad: MR. WUNCLER.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
>> Riley: SOLVED, NIGGA.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
WE'RE PITCHING SHOWS.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Granddad: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
YOU  WANT TO MEET
PRETTY BOY FLIZZY.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Granddad: OH!

REGIONS OF YOUR WHITE WIFE OR

Granddad: THAT'S ENOUGH!

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
UH...

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
THAT'S THE JOB?

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
"TERRORIST OR ITALIAN?"
BECAUSE THOSE HAIRY

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
NO,  JAZMINE
WANTS TO MEET PRETTY BOY FLIZZY.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU ON A
SUNDAY MORNING AT 7:00 A.M.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
WELL, GIVE ME A RED LIGHT AND

I WAS JUST...WONDERING IF YOU,
UM, HAD THAT MONEY.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
>> Huey: HEY, STOP!

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
MAKE SURE TO READ THE PART
WHERE WE GET TO CAP YOUR ASS IF

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
AWAY TO SET UP A DINNER.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Riley: SO, THE NEXT TIME YOU
SAY "GAY" TO --

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Tom: NO, YOU WANT ME TO
DEFEND PRETTY BOY FLIZZY BECAUSE

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
THEY LOOK ALIKE.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
OUR SLAVE SHIFT IS OVER!

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000

Granddad: I HAVE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO SAY, TOO --

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Huey: I WON'T DO THIS AGAIN.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
SHUT UP AND GET BACK OUTSIDE.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Granddad: YOU'RE NOT GONNA

Huey: GRANDDAD, IF I KNEW
SOMETHING BAD WAS ABOUT TO

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I SAW KARDASHIA AT A PLACE
CALLED FAKE CAKES.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Huey:  IN RETROSPECT, NONE OF US SHOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000

IT'S NEAR THAT ILLEGAL PINOCHLE
SPOT WHERE YOU USED TO LEAVE ME

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
WELL, GO ON.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
THIS IS MORE LIKE AN NFL
TRAINING CAMP.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
WE ARE ASSEMBLED HERE TODAY FOR
AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
IT'S DAMN NEAR LIKE A WHOLE
OTHER HOUSE.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
A MARATHON THAT LONG WOULD WRECK
MY KNEES.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I'M AN ESCORT.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
ABLE TO HELP EACH OTHER.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
YOU'RE THE BOSS...WILLONA.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
YES, THIS IS GOOD FOR THE BODY
AND THE SOUL.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
HEY, LOOK WHO'S COMING.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Granddad: YOU READ WHAT'S ON

11:01.000 --> 11:01.000
IS THAT IT?!

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
IS THAT WHY SHE'S LOST
INTEREST?!

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY WILL TELL

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Granddad: YOU GONNA TRY TO
TRAP ME BY GETTING PREGNANT?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
OF COURSE.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Tom: UH...HOW CAN THAT BE
GOOD?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
TOM!

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Granddad: HEY, CUTIE PIE.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000

I DIDN'T WANT TO SEEM TOO EAGER!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
GO HOME, OLD MAN!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
DON'T YOU BELIEVE IN MY RIGHT TO
TELL THE TRUTH?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
POWERS OF HER GOLD-PLATED VAGINA
TO CARE FOR HER ADORABLE KIDS.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
THAT BUS!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
YOU'RE A LOSER!

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Huey: JUST READ WHAT'S ON THE
DAMN PAGE.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
YOU GOT NO FLASH, NO SWAG, NO
THIN VENEER OF TOUGHNESS.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
It's never too late to fake
your own death.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
HEY, NIGGER-LOVERS!

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
PREGNANT? EW!

HOW ABOUT SOME OF THIS, BOY?!

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
OH, I HAVE THAT PHONE.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
OF COURSE YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU AND
IS DOING IT TO SOME RANDOM GUY.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
YOU, MY NIGGER, IS A HO.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
NO, SILLY, A PROMISE RING DURING
THE SEASON FINALE.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T HAVE AN iPHONE.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
ALL RI-I-I-GHT.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
WHY DON'T YOU CRAWL BACK IN
YOUR HOLE?!

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, HERE IS
RILEY FREEMAN!

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000

HAPPENED.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
PLEASE!

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Granddad: THEN IT'S A DEAL.

WELL, WELL, WELL!

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
THAT'S YOUR JOB -- HOIN'?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Ruckus: OH, THE MASSA LOVES
TAP DANCING.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
SOMETHING ABOUT THE APPLE
STORE REALLY ANNOYS ME.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
YOU READY FOR ONE MORE
ASS-WHUPPING?!

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
ADVISE MY GRANDFATHER BRIEFLY?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
PLEASE, WE DON'T MEAN ANY -- OH,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
HE SAYS THE TIPPITY-TAP OF NIGGA
FEETS IS SO MEDITATIVE.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
DRESS AND HOW TO TALK TO BITCHES
AND SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Granddad: HELL, NO!

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE SUCH
DICKS, RIGHT?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Granddad: I WILL NOT FIGHT
YOU, STINKMEANER.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Granddad: WHOA!

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000

I'M ESCORTING LADIES.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO!

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Tom: RUCKUS, I HATE TO BREAK
MY AMUSEMENT-PARK CHARACTER AND

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Granddad: I FEEL THE SAME
WAY.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Tom: YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
We need to get up out of here,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Riley: WELL, THAT'S ALL
RIGHT, THEN.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
WHAT'S THE ATTITUDE FOR?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
SAY, SPEAKING OF PHONES, WE
SHOULD EXCHANGE --

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
SAY WHAT, NIGGA?!

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
WHY NOT?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Granddad.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
YOU KNEW I APPRECIATED THE FINER
THINGS BEFORE WE GOT PROMISED!

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
YOU NOT GONNA FIGHT?!

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TEACH ME HOW TO
DANCE, RIGHT?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
>> Granddad: LEAVE? WHY?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
ACTUALLY, THAT'S KIND OF
GANGSTA.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
THEN WHY'D YOU COME?!

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
OH, GOD! OH, GOD! HELP US!

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Huey: YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
GET A REAL JOB.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
NIGGA, YOU COULD'VE TOLD ME
YOU'S A BITCH OVER THE PHONE!

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
NO DANCING.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
gangsters.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
WHAT THE HELL?!

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
BUT THERE WILL BE A SHOPPING
MONTAGE.

THE BIG DEAL IS.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
UNH!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Granddad: I CAME BECAUSE I'M
NOT AFRAID OF YOU!

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
TWO THINGS WOMEN HATE -- BROKE
MEN AND BORING MEN.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Granddad: HEY!

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
MISS BOSS WILLONA IS A PILLAR OF

THEY SPECIFICALLY FORBID KEEPING

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Granddad: DECLINED?!

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
NO, THAT'S CRAZY.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
BUT I'M TIRED OF ACTING LIKE
A NIGGA!

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
THE COMMUNITY.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
THE BIG DEAL IS THAT WOMEN WOULD
PAY TO  YOU!

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
OH. MY. GOD!

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I HAVE TONS OF MONEY IN THAT...

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
GOOD NEWS IS, YOU'RE NOT BROKE.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
OH, THIS IS

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I'M AN OLD MAN. I'M DIGNIFIED.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Granddad: YES, UH, I'M THE

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
IT SAYS I'M SUPPOSED TO
CONFISCATE THE CARD, BUT YOU CAN

I WATCH PBS.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
BUT YOU ARE BORING, AND WOMEN
HATE TO BE BORED, TOM.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, YOU'RE NOT
REALLY GONNA DO THIS?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
ALL Y'ALL SHOULD BE ASHAMED!

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000

POINT THERE, TOM.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR!

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
YOU AIN'T THE OWNER OF THE
HOUSE.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
JUST GO AHEAD.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
THEY HATE TO BE BORED.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
EDDIE WUNCLER'S THE OWNER OF
THIS HOUSE

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
THIS STUFF.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Granddad: KNOW WHAT I'M NOT

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I COULD LET YOU GO...

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Granddad: OH.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
NOW, I'VE ALREADY CALLED THE
POLICE, SO EVERYONE SHOULD JUST

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
A WOMAN WOULD RATHER BE WITH A
GUY THAT BEATS THEM TO DEATH

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
>> Granddad: NO, THERE ISN'T.

FIGHT!

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000

Granddad:

BABY, WAKE UP!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Granddad: I WAS HOPING TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
GET OUR FREEDOM IS TO TAKE IT.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
THERE'S A BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
>> Granddad: YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY,

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
YEARS.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
EVERY TIME YOU DO THAT, YOU'RE
ACTUALLY KIND OF KILLING HER.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
HOW DO YOU DIAL ON THESE THINGS?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
BUT WHY AM I SO SEXY?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000

NOW EXCUSE ME.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000

Riley: I AIN'T TRYING TO DIE.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Granddad: PLEASE!

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
WHAT IS THE SECRET TO MY
SEXINESS?

11:54.000 --> 11:54.000
STAND YOU.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Granddad: SORRY.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Huey: WELL, THIS ISN'T
EXACTLY LIVING, IS IT?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
HELLO? YES.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
THIS AIN'T OVER, ROBERT!

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
EVERYONE, SETTLE DOWN!

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
IT'S A HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
MM. OHH.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I ALMOST LAUGHED.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
SO, WHAT'S THE LATEST,
DOCTOR?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
REMEMBER THIS WHEN YOU GET HOME
AND YOU WANT TO WATCH TV AND EAT

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I'M TRYING TO REACH THE FRAUD
DEPARTMENT.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
COMPOUND.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
LOOK, ON BEHALF OF RILEY AND THE
WHOLE FREEMAN CLAN, WE APOLOGIZE

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
ABSOLUTELY.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT?!

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
IT'S A HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
MM.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
WELL, AFTER BILLING HER
INSURANCE FOR EVERY TEST

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES ON MY

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
WE GOT YOUR BACK,
STINKMEANER!

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
BUT, REALLY, IT'S BECAUSE I'M A

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
THIS IN THEIR HAIR.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
JUNK FOOD AND LET THE MACHINE
MAKE ALL YOUR DECISIONS.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Granddad: NO, PLEASE.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
>> Granddad: DAMN IT, BOY.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
POSSIBLE BECAUSE -- LET'S FACE
IT -- THE LONGER I'M GONE, THE

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I DON'T WANNA HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I'M GONNA BEAT YOUR ASS WHEN WE

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
GOD, I SHOULD HAVE SIGNED UP FOR
MORE THAN THREE HOURS.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
CREDIT CARD.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I GET ARRESTED, I DO DRUGS, I
ROB LIQUOR STORES -- ALLEGEDLY!

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
GET HOME.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
AAH!

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Riley: DAMN, AIN'T I PUNISHED
ENOUGH?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
IT WORKED.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
FOR EVER SAYING  ANYTHING  IS GAY.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I JUST HAVE TO GO TO THE
BATHROOM.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
HARDER YOU THINK I'M WORKING --
I THINK I'VE FIGURED OUT THE

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
NO, I  DIDN'T  ORDER A SHIPMENT OF
PINK, DIAMOND-ENCRUSTED iPHONE

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
FIRST I GOT TO BE A SLAVE, NOW
YOU SAYIN' IT'S MY FAULT.

12:05.000 --> 12:14.000
IT WORKED.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
RILEY'S NOT A NORMAL CHILD.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Granddad:

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
PROBLEM.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
THAT'S WHAT ALL WOMEN WANT.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
EXPLOSIVE?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
OHH, ROBERT!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
CASES!

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I DON'T THINK HE'S A  BAD  KID.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
HER ASS EXPLODED.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Tom: THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT,
FREEMANS!

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
HOW YOU GONNA THREATEN TO CALL
THE POLICE ON ME?!

12:09.000 --> 12:09.000
Tom: WHY?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
YOU THINK THEM BITCHES OUT THERE

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I'LL GET YOU, YOU BLACK SLUT!

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
HE'S JUST KIND OF TOUCHED, YOU
KNOW -- IN THE HEAD.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE NO
SELF-RESPECT!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
CARE ABOUT A LITTLE FIRE?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I HAVE FRIENDS WITH LOTS OF
EXTRA ASS!

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
I PAY MY MORTGAGE ON TIME!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
IT'S  MY  ACCOUNT!

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Tom: WELL, MY WIFE HAS

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
THIS HERE WILL TURN YOUR BRAIN

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
CAN WE DONATE?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I EARNED MY FREEDOM!

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I'VE BEEN HACKED!

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
ROBERT, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
NONVIOLENT!

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS TOUGH ON
FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHEN A

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Granddad: TOM, STOP GRIPING.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
MY IDENTITY HAS BEEN STOLEN!

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
HE'S...SPECIAL.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
SELF-RESPECT.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
GREEN.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
HEY!

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
REALLY? YOU SURE?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
THIS STUFF HAS PLUTONIUM.

12:15.000 --> 12:15.000
HER?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Granddad: NO.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
PERSON'S ASS GETS THIS BIG, BUT
I'M AFRAID WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
YOU GOT CONNECTIONS ON THE
OUTSIDE.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
UH, SPECIAL  HOW?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Tom: YES!

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
HER?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Granddad: UNH-UNH.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
YOU CAN CALL ONE OF YOUR LEGAL
FRIENDS AND GET YOUR ASS OUT!

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
LIKE "SPECIAL NEEDS" SPECIAL?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
SHE'S AN EDUCATED, WELL-ROUNDED,
CONFIDENT WOMAN.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
THIS ONE HERE IS ACID.

12:17.000 --> 12:17.000
Granddad: NO!

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Tom: YOU NASTY, SICK MAN!

12:18.000 --> 12:18.000
HER?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Granddad: NOPE.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
HEY, YOU BIG, OLD PICKANINNY!

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Granddad: HMM.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
THAT'S IT!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
JUST ACID.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
AND WHAT ABOUT HER?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Tom: CALL?!

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
YOU'RE DISGUSTING!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
ED WUNCLER, MY FAVORITE
BILLIONAIRE!

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I-I GUESS.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I MAY NEED TO MEET HER.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
HE RENTED MY BATHROOM!

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Granddad: NO, MARGE SIMPSON'S
NOT PRETTIER THAN YOU, EITHER!

12:20.000 --> 12:20.000
HOLD STILL!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ME?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
DID YOU SAY "CALL?!"
OH, I'M SORRY!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF,
YOU FILTHY TURD OF A MAN?!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
HE GOT A BUNCH OF SPECIAL
NEEDS.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Tom: NO, NO, NO. NO.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
OH, THAT'S THE WHOLE HOUSE.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
DON'T YOU GET IT?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST CASES
OF AAAS I'VE EVER SEEN.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I KNOW WHERE THIS GOES.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
A MAN CAN'T TRULY CALL HIMSELF A
MAN ONCE A STRANGER'S ASS CHEEKS

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
THESE BITCHES WOULD PUT NAPALM

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
HUH?!

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Granddad: HUH?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
HE NEEDS AN ASS-WHUPPING TWICE A
DAY, HE NEEDS TO NOT DRINK

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
YOU'RE PRETTIER THAN TONIGHT'S
ENTIRE LINEUP AND ALL OF BASIC

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
WELL, I HEARD ABOUT YOUR
LITTLE INCIDENT, AND I WANTED TO

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO MY WIFE.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
ON THEIR HAIR IF IT WOULD MAKE

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
THAT'S A.A.A.S. -- ASS
AUGMENTATION ADDICTION SYNDROME.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE,
MASSA DIDN'T PROVIDE ME WITH A

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Tom: HOW COULD YOU PUT THAT
ON YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE?!

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
DO YOUR WIFE?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
IT STRAIGHT.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
AAH!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
TOM, I WOULDN'T DO YOUR WIFE.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
HAVE BEEN ON HIS PRIVATE TOILET!

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
PUT A WARNING LABEL ON IT.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
CABLE!

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
PHONE!

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
MY DAUGHTER IS FRIENDS WITH YOU
ON FACEBOOK!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
SEE IF YOU WERE OKAY.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
ANYTHING PAST 8:00 P.M. OR HE'LL
WET THE BED, HE NEEDS TO STOP

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Tom: YOU HAVE A SONG CALLED
"I WILL DO YOUR WIFE!"

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Riley: THIS ALL YOUR FAULT,
GRANDDAD.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
OH, THANK YOU.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Granddad: OH, I'M FINE.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
OW!

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Granddad: DOC, YOU GOT TO
MAKE HER LIVE!

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
WALKING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU BEFORE
HE PASSES GAS.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
YOU REALLY TURNED OUR LIFE INTO
"GOOD TIMES."

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
SORRY.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
YOU'RE GONNA ROT IN
H-E-DOUBLE  HOCKEY STICKS

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I
BROUGHT A FRIEND OVER.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I DIDN'T MEAN  YOUR  WIFE!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Granddad: OUR LIFE IS NOT
"GOOD TIMES."

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
FAIR?

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
WHAT I MEANT WAS WE'RE IN THIS
TOGETHER.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
FOR THIS, ROBERT!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
WHAT'S GOOD, NIGGA?!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
HMM. LET ME THINK.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
LIFE TENDS NOT TO BE FAIR WHEN
YOU START SHOVING FOREIGN

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I MEANT THAT METAPHORICALLY.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
WE STILL LIVE IN A NICE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Granddad: WAIT, NO!

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
YOU THOUGHT YOU GOT RID OF ME?!

12:33.000 --> 12:33.000
YES!

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
RILEY IS A SPECIAL-NEEDS CHILD.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Riley: YEAH, FOR NOW.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
YES! YES!

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Granddad: OOH!

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
OBJECTS INTO YOUR KEISTER.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
WHAT DID I PUT ON MY FACEBOOK?!

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Tom: MM, I STILL DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Huey: YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GET A
JOB, GRANDDAD.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I WON'T BE FREE UNTIL WE'RE ALL
FREE!

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
HE HAS A NUMBER OF BEHAVIORAL
AND DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000

OH, GOD, I'VE BEEN SO LONELY!

12:45.000 --> 12:45.000
Granddad: THAT'S GARBAGE!

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
YOUR GENERATION IS JUST LAZY,

Granddad: AAH!

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
NO PROBLEM.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
PLUS, WHO'S EVEN HIRING NOW?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THESE

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
NO! AAH!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
YOU REALLY SHOULD STOP
SNITCHING, ROBERT.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
FREEMAN FAMILY, AND I AM MORALLY
COMPELLED TO SAY SHAME ON

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
I THOUGHT YOU GAVE UP WORK TO
RUN FOR MAYOR.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Ruckus: I DIDN'T GIVE UP
WORK.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Ruckus: "FRIENDS"?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Tom: WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
HADN'T TWEETED OUR ADDRESS TO

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
HOW THEY LINE UP FOR THIS

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
OHH!

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
THEY CURED BREAST CANCER.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
AIN'T NO FRIENDS WHEN IT COMES
TO SLAVERY -- REAL OR MAKE

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
COME FIND ME, ROBERT.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS COUNTRY
WHEN TWO GROWN MEN CAN'T SETTLE

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I GAVE UP WORKING FOR NIGGAS,
AND OTHER COLORS, LIKE MEXICANS

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
COME HERE, NIGGER.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I'M SURE IT'LL CURE THIS.

WALTER SWEETLOVE FOR THE PAIN HE
HAS INFLICTED ON THIS BRAVE,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
THAT'S HER AGAIN, DAMN IT!

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Granddad: OH, NO!

Granddad: NO!

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
BELIEVE.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
THEIR DIFFERENCES IN A BLOODY
STREET FIGHT?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Tom: YEAH, YOU WERE F'ed UP,
I KNOW.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
YOU WANT A CHANCE TO SHINE?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
NOW, SINCE I WAS CURSED WITH
REVITILIGO AND BORN IN THE 20th

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
SWEET LITTLE BOY AND HIS TRAGIC,
UNSPECIFIED MENTAL AFFLICTION.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
NOW YOU BETTER GRAB SOME SUDS
AND START WAXING HOODS.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
JUST TO
SEE WHAT I'M DOING.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD COME IN

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
OKAY, SO, CHECK IT.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
WE'RE GONNA GET JUSTICE FOR YOUR
SISTER AND SHOW HOW MUCH WE

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
WHICH ONE OF YOU TOOK IT?!

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
KEY WITH CHICKS IS TO INSULT
THEM WHEN YOU COMPLIMENT THEM.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
LORD, A HO CAN'T BE A
BLESSIN' IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
WHICH ONE OF YOU TOOK IT?!

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Granddad: NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT!

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
THANK YOU.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
MAGICAL NATURE KNOWN AS SLAVERY.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
GIVE IT TO ME!

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000

FOOT IN MY HOUSE!

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
NO! NO! YOU'RE CRAZY!

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
WHO KNEW? OH, THE POOR KID.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
KNOCK HER DOWN A PEG.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
JUST SEEMED TO BE A WASTE OF A
BOMB-ASS PHONE.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
NIGGAS.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
COULDN'T EVEN GET THE STUPID
LADY TO WORK.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
THE ONE THAT'S UNDERWATER, THE
ONE YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN LIVE

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
OH! WELL, NO WONDER!

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Granddad: WHAT ARE YOU DOING

13:11.000 --> 13:18.000
OOH, LOOK AT HER.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
OH, OH, OH, AND DON'T GET NO
CRAZY IDEAS ABOUT WRITING

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Granddad: DAMN YOU, NEGRO
CHILD!

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
UH-OH.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Tom: HEY, SWEETIE, YOU LOOK
LOVELY TONIGHT.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000

LOOKING FOR HELP.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE
DONE!

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
IN OUT OF THE LITTLE WARMTH IN
MY COLD, HARD HEART!

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD LIKE

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Sarah: OH, THANK YOU, HONEY.

13:16.000 --> 13:16.000

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
WE'VE GOT TO FIND STURDY AND

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
ANY SLAVE I CATCH READING OR
WRITING WILL BE SHOT

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
TO EXTEND A SINCERE, HEARTFELT
APOLOGY TO RILEY FREEMAN, HIS

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
SO, YOU'RE JUST GONNA SIT THERE

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Granddad: FINE, TAKE THIS.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
OH, SHE LOOK GOOD.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
COME ON, MAN!

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
NO.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
ROBERT, YOU SHOULD CALM DOWN

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
Sarah: ASSHOLE!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
LESS SWEAT, MORE SCRUB!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
>> Riley: THAT'S OKAY.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE NON--
Granddad:  AAH!

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
I WOULD GIVE MY ASS FOR THAT
ASS.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
IMMEDIATELY!

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
WHAT THE  KIND OF

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
LOOK, LOU GOSSETT JR. IS
WASHING MY CAR.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
GOOD NIGHT.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
SO WE CAN DISCUSS THIS LIKE ADULTS.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
GRANDFATHER...

13:22.000 --> 13:22.000
HE JUST DON'T GET NONE OF THIS

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
MONEY.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
AND LISTEN REAL CAREFUL.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Granddad: WE'RE NOT
DISCUSSING ANYTHING!

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
>> Granddad: I UNDERSTAND, HUEY.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
NO, I'M SERIOUS, I WILL SHOOT
YOU.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
SO, AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE STILL

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
AND THE OTHER ONE.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
STOP TRYING TO HIDE INSIDE MY
TRUNK.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
FIRST, WOMEN DON'T PAY FOR
DANGLE.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
YOU'RE NOT A PERSON!

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
SO MANY BAD THINGS HAS HAPPENED

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
PRAY TO YOUR NEW TRUE GOD, WHITE
JESUS.

13:25.000 --> 13:25.000
YOU ARE A MACHINE!

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I FORGET HIS NAME.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I DON'T KNOW  WHY  THEY FIRED
THE SAND PEOPLE.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
TO US.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
AAH!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
SO ARE YOU, ROBERT.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE WITH
THIS HOUSE.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
IS THIS THE  NEW  NEW FACE OF
HATE?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
IT'S HARD NOT TO ASSUME THE

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
EVEN I CAN GO TO A CLUB AND
ROLL OUT WITH SOME FREE DICK FOR

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
THAT'LL MAKE IT ALL BETTER.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
WE'RE JUST MADE OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS, BUT LOVE IS STRONGER

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Granddad: HEY, NEIGHBOR!

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
WORST.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
OKAY, SLEEP TIGHT.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
BUT DON'T YOU SEE?

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
YOU OWE ME A LOT OF MONEY, AND I
STARTED THINKING THIS HILARIOUS

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
WALTER SWEETLOVE, UNDER FIRE AT
THIS HOUR FOR INCITING HATRED

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
WE, UH, HEARD THERE'S A DINNER
PARTY GOING DOWN, AND I NEVER

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
THIS TIME, IT'S DIFFERENT.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
THE NIGHT.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.000
ROBERT!

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
AAH! DIANE!

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
THAN OUR PHYSICAL BEINGS.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR OUR
WOMEN IS BIGGER THAN THAT.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Riley: DAMN.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I KNOW SOMETHING ELSE STRONGER

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
THIS TIME, EVERYTHING'S GONNA

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
AAH!

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
HUEY, I'M READY TO BUST UP OUT
OF HERE, MAN.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
THING YOU GUYS DO TOGETHER COULD
BE THE ANSWER!

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
RECEIVED THE E-VITE, SO HERE WE
ARE.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Ruckus: OH, LOOK AT THAT.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
WORK OUT PERFECTLY.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
BETWEEN HOMOSEXUALS AND THE
COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED --

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
YOU'RE BOOSTING THEIR
SELF-ESTEEM, MAKING THEM FEEL

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
OFF OF ME!

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Granddad: SO YOU GET OFF ON
GETTING MY KARDASHIA ALL STRUNG

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
THAN YOUR PHYSICAL BEING.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I KNOW IT.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
DIANE NOW CONFRONTS A MORAL
AND PHILOSOPHICAL DILEMMA.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I KNOW YOU GOT A PLAN.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
IT'S THIS HAMMER!

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Granddad: THIS MAN IS A
PSYCHOPATHIC STALKER, AND WE

I GUESS IT ALL STARTED WHEN I
WAS A NURSE IN THE WAR.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
THAT RESIDES IN THE PHONE, AND
SHE'S JUST AS REAL AS YOU OR I.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Tom: I THINK THERE MAY BE A
PROBLEM.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
AW, HERE WE GO AGAIN.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
NAW, MAN.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Ruckus: "AND IF YOU TURN THAT
BUS AROUND AND LEAVE DECENT

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Huey: NOT FOR LONG.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
IS THAT WHAT NIGGAS IS CALLING
THE SHORT-BUS KIDS NOW --

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
TO JUST STAND UP AND WALK OUT,
THAT TOOK GUTS.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
ALL THE ROOMS IN YOUR HOUSE.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
ISN'T ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Granddad: DAMN!

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
DEFIANT. I LIKES.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Granddad: ONLY PROBLEM IS YOU
THINK I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
YOU SEE, BOYS, IN MANY WAYS,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Tom: ALL I ENDED UP LEARNING
IS MY WIFE LIKES YOU BETTER.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
BAD NEWS IS, WE'RE STILL NOT
REALLY MAKIN' A DENT IN YOUR

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
>> Granddad: NO!

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
WHITE FOLKS ALONE, THEN THE BOMB
WILL NOT EXPLODE."

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
I USED MY PANTYHOSE AS
TOURNIQUETS FOR THE TROOPS.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
BUT PERHAPS YOUR ILL FEELINGS
ARE MISPLACED, LITTLE ANGRY AFRO

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I'M SUPERIOR TO A REAL-LIFE STEP-GRANDMOTHER.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
"SPECIALLY ABLED"?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
HI, MR. FREEMAN.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
NIGGA,  NINJAS  ARE SPECIALLY
ABLED.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
DEBT.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
>> Huey: YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Huey: HOW?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
PROMISED HER MORE, GRANDDAD.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
ROBERT?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
YOUR WIFE DOESN'T LIKE ME
BETTER.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
THERE IS NO WAY I'M MAKING MORE.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
HUH.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Huey: LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE LIVED
A FULL LIFE.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.000
BOY?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
YOUR GRANDFATHER?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Granddad: WELL, SHE'S LIGHTER
AND THINNER THAN A REAL

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
LUKE SKYWALKER IS SPECIALLY
ABLED.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH JUST BORING
AS

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I'LL JUST PUT THIS IN THAT NICE,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
>> Granddad: FINE.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
IF YOU ASK ME, I THINK THAT WAS
PERFECTLY REASONABLE.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
ALL THESE OTHER FOLKS?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
WE'LL MAKE IT.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
SHE USED REAL SWEET POTATOES.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
OH, I HAVE.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
ALREADY SLAVES IN DEBT TO ME
BEFORE THEY BECAME SLAVES HERE.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
GRANDMOTHER, AND YOU KNOW HOW
REAL WOMEN CAN PUT ON WEIGHT,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
YOU  NIGGAS IS JUST RETAR--
OW!

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
YOU'RE ROLLING WITH ME TONIGHT.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
>> Riley: YEAH, YEAH.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
HA! THOSE MEDALS -- EVEN GOT ONE
FROM THE VICE PRESIDENTE AFTER

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
WE'LL MAKE IT, NIGGA.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
OH, MY GOODNESS.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
AIN'T SPECIALLY
ABLED!

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I'M TAKING YOU TO MAN CAMP.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
YOU THINK YOU THE ONLY ONE IN

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
AND SHE'S GREAT WITH DIRECTIONS.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
BUT I DON'T HANG WITH NO
NEGATIVE-ENERGY-SUCKING

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
COOL CORNER.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
THIS HOUSE WHO KNOWS CHEMISTRY?

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
OKAY. INSTRUCT ME ON WHAT YOU
EXPECT AT NIGHT -- TELL YOU

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
THERE ARE JUST SO MANY THINGS.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
UNH! HEY!

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Granddad: UH...

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
>> Huey: OBVIOUSLY.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
WORLD WAR II.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
AND HEY, YOUR SCOWL -- NOT
HELPING.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
I INVITE YOU TO BROWSE THE APP
STORE TO SEE ALL THE AMAZING

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Granddad: DAMN IT, WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE GOING, BITCH!

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Granddad: TECHNICALLY, NO.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
SO GATHER UP SOME
POSITIVITY IN THIS BITCH RIGHT

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
>> Granddad: OKAY. WELL, UH-HUH.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
IS WRONG WITH
YOU?!

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
SURE. Y-YEAH.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
YOU LOOK BETTER WITHOUT MAKEUP,
A COUPLE OF "I'LL KILL MYSELF IF

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
YEP, HE GAVE ME A MEDAL AND SOME
SMOKES.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
BUT HE IS A DUMBASS.

16:29.000 --> 16:29.000
I GOT A LITTLE OF THE STUFF

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
THINGS SHE CAN DO.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I OUGHT TO WHUP YOUR BIG
ASS!

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Y'ALL THINK THIS IS A GAME?!

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
QUICK AND LET'S ROLL OUT.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
LEFT.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Huey: HOW CAN YOU LIVE WITH
YOURSELF?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, CAN I TALK TO
YOU IN PRIVATE?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
OUT OF MY
WAY!

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Tom: OKAY! I CAN BE POSITIVE.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I CAN SEND IT TO A LAB. YEAH.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
SORRY, THERE, FREEDOM
FELLERS -- TIME AND A HALF JUST

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF HE'D
VISITED ME WHEN I HAD EMPHYSEMA.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES IT TAKE FOR
SOMEONE TO LOSE THEIR

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST USE OUR
CAUSE AND NOT CUT US IN?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
THAT ALWAYS WORKS ON TV.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
YOU LEAVE ME"?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Granddad: OF COURSE NOT,
GRANDSON.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Riley: SLOW DOWN, GRANDDAD!

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'M NOT A LOSER.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'LL GET IT ANALYZED.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
YOU'RE JUST SILLY-ACTING.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
CONSCIENCE?

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
I CAN...GET STUFF...HAPPENING,
AND I GOT STUFF GOING ON!

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
SO, Y'ALL HAD ANY LUCK WITH
THE MONEY?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I'LL MAKE IT MYSELF.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
AIN'T WORTH IT.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
Huey: WELL, WHO DO YOU

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
NO GUILT, NO SHAME.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY TO ME, YOU
CAN SAY IN FRONT OF MS. SIRI.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, WATCH OUT FOR
THAT CURB!

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
HOW HARD COULD IT BE?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Granddad: WHEN DID THEY START

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Granddad: WELL, IT'S BEEN
REAL -- HOPE YOU REACH THE

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
JUST GREED.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Riley: OW!

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Granddad: NO, THAT WASN'T THE
PLAN AT ALL.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
MAYBE...MILLION, AT LEAST?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
I CAN'T FIND MY SEAT BELT!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
>> Riley: ANALYZED, NIGGA.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
PROMISED LAND.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
DAMN. YOU'RE A DOWNER.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
YES, HUEY. WE ARE A FAMILY.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Huey: WHOA, HEY, GRANDDAD, I

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
IF I DON'T GIVE YOU SOME
MONEY, I'M GONNA CALL THEM

16:38.000 --> 16:38.000
SOMETHING?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Granddad: EDDIE, I'M SORRY.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
KNOCKING?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
THE STRUGGLE NEEDS YOU,
ROBERT.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
YOU SHOULD TRY TRANSCENDENTAL
MEDITATION OR -- ANYWAY, LOOK,

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I TAUGHT THEM.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Granddad: NIGGA, IF YOU DON'T
GET OUT OF MY WAY --

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE SECRETS.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT YOUR
EYESIGHT AND WHETHER IT'S SAFE

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
THINGS COULD BE WORSE.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
IT'S GOOD MANNERS.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
USUALLY TALK TO?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
WHAT IS IT?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
BACK AND TELL 'EM YOU
LYING!

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I COULD BE THAT GUY.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I'M ON A FIXED INCOME.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
DON'T YOU HAVE VISITORS?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Huey: RILEY'S TALKING IN HIS
SLEEP.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I'M MOSTLY INDIAN ON MY MAMA
SIDE, ANYWAY.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
EH, NO ONE CARES ABOUT AN OLD
BROKE LADY.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
STOP BEING ALL "FREEDOM FIGHTER"

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Riley: I'M JUST READING.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW TO SEE

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000

PLUS, THERE'S SOME CELEBRITY IN

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000

SOME MONEY.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
SHE SAID READIN' WAS HOW SHE GOT
RICH ENOUGH TO RENT GRANDDAD.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Granddad: YOU KNOW THAT'S
KIDNAPPING, RIGHT?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
YOU KNOW, ONE WHERE HE HAS NO
REAL POWER, BUT YOUR PEOPLE ARE

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
>> Granddad: WUNCLER OWNS THIS

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED THE POLICE
ON HIS ASS.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
THEY SAY SHE'S GOT THE WHOLE
FLOOR LOCKED DOWN.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
YOU MEAN EXTORTION?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Granddad: ENOUGH.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
BUT I WAS LIKE, "LET ME?

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
I CAN'T EVEN GET A NURSE TO

NO, NOT AT ALL, HUEY!

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
YEAH, BUT WE GONNA MAKE IT

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I'M A GROWN-ASS MAN.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Huey: I'M GONNA HAVE TO PASS.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
THAT COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM
THE TRUTH.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
THIS MAN IS A CUSTOMER.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
IT SAFELY OR WATCH ME BLOW THIS

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I DO WHAT THE HELL I WANT."

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Riley: EW!

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I HATE IT!

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A DONATION,
BECAUSE I'M  TAKING  IT.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
YOU GOT RILEY READING?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
WHAT GOOD IS IT FOR A MAN TO
GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD, YET LOSE

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
ME AND MS. SIRI ARE VERY MUCH IN
LOVE.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.000
I HATE IT!

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
HATE IT!

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
HE IS A DEAR FAMILY FRIEND.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
I AIN'T HUNGRY NOW.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
HE IS A WAR HERO -- A
CIVIL-RIGHTS LEGEND!

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
>> Riley: YOUR CALL, NIGGA.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
WHOO!

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
AH, BUT I FORGIVE HER AND ALL
THE PEOPLE AROUND HER.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
HE'S VERY HAPPY.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OUR
SPACE!

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
THAT MUST HAVE TAKEN A BEATING
AND A HALF.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
HIS SOUL?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
I ASSURE YOU.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
YES, WE
UNDERSTAND THAT'S HOW EXTORTION

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
RUCKUS!

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Riley: THEN WHY HE SWEATING?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT?!

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
WE MUST FIND A WAY TO HELP HIM!

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
BOYS, THERE'S GREAT POWER IN
FORGIVENESS, SELF-SACRIFICE, AND

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Ruckus: HOW DARE YOU GO
DARKENING MR. WUNCLER'S THOUGHTS

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
THAT IS SWEAT OF JOY.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
THAT!

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
>> Huey: YOU TWO HAVE TO FOLLOW

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I DIDN'T BEAT HIM.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
STINKMEANER!

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Granddad: SIRI, BABY, I'M
SORRY.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
STINKMEANER!

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Granddad: WOW!

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
I PROMISE YOU, I'M WORTH BEING
BITCH-SLAPPED FOR.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
SPENDING ON AN OLD MAN?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
THERE'LL BE ENOUGH FOR
EVERYBODY.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
KILL THEM! YEAH!

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Huey:  THAT  IS A SPECIAL
ABILITY.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
CAN YOU THROW ME A LINE?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Granddad: I DIDN'T!

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
REVERSE HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
HE DIDN'T KNOW.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
TRYING TO GET MY UNION CARD.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
SHE'S RIGHT.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Ruckus: OH, IT JUST AIN'T
NATURAL, ROBERT.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
THIS NIGGA AIN'T GIVIN' IN.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
IS THAT WHAT I AM TO YOU --

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
THANKS.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
IF WE STOP NOW, THEN THOSE WHO
WOULD OPPRESS US SHALL KNOW THAT

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
SO IT'S ANOTHER STEP UP THE
HUMILIATION LADDER -- TAR AND

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
SOME MACHINE YOU CAN JUST TURN OFF?

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000

YOU'RE GONNA COME TO THE
REGIONALS IN TWO WEEKS.

IT AIN'T NATURAL.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
WE LOVE YOU!

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'M STARTING TO FEEL UNAPPRECIATED, ROBERT.

Tom: UH, NOPE!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
BATS, BOMBS, AND GUNS ARE ALL
THEY NEED TO SCARE US.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
MEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE
STRONG HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
WE'LL TAKE THE PHOTO THERE AND
USE IT FOR THE POSTER FOR OUR

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000

NOBODY WILL EVER FIND THIS.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
NO.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Granddad: THAT'S ALL THEY
NEED TO SCARE  ME!

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
WHITE WOMEN'S JOB IS TO MAKE
SAMMICHES AND LOOK PRETTY.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000

Riley: IT DON'T SOUND GOOD TO ME.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
AAAAAAAH!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
HOW'D IT GO?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
PUNK.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Sarah: NO, NO.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Granddad: WE'RE STILL IN
NEGOTIATIONS.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
CONFLICTED.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
YOU TAKE YOUR PICK.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
OKAY. SEE YA.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
>> TOODLES.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
ROOFTOPS, EVERYWHERE YOU CAN GET
'EM.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
LOOK, GO ON, KIDS.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I WAS MESSED UP INSIDE AND OUT.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
GODDAMN, NIGGA, THAT

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
HOW ABOUT "CAKE"?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
IT'LL BE FINE.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I DON'T WANT TO BORE YOU.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
SURE THING, MRS. DuBOIS.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
THESE NIGGERS WILL NOT CROSS THE
STATE LINE.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
SURE, SURE, ROBERT, HIGH YELLOW
AS HE IS, IS STILL A NIGGA DOWN

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
I GUESS WHEN YOU GET TO BE MY
AGE, YOU JUST WANT A LITTLE

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
HURT!

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
AAH!

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
THEY'RE MY LONELY, BITTER
GIRLFRIENDS.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
RUCKUS?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
ATTENTION, THAT'S ALL.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.000
HUH?

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
Ruckus: HUH?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
YOU -- YOU MISSED ME, NIGGA!

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Ruckus:  BRAVE WHITE MEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, YOU ARE THE

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Huey: I THINK WE KNOW WHERE
THAT GIRL IS WHO'S HOGGING THE

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
TO THE BONE.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Granddad:

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Granddad: OW, OW, OW!

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
I TOLD THEM ABOUT YOU, AND THEY
COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY YOU OUT.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
AND WHILE SIRI HERE IS NOT AN
ACTUAL CAUCASIAN WOMAN, SHE DOES

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Granddad:

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
WHOOPS.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
>> Huey: PUT OUT THE CIGARETTE.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
LAST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR THE WHITE MAN'S ENTIRE GLORIOUS WAY

19:04.000 --> 19:04.000
NURSES.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
WE'LL GET ONE FOR YOU.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
SORRY, I WAS JUST CUTTIN' SOME,
UH, MEAT EARLIER.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
THE LOWER CLASS!

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Granddad: I THOUGHT WE -- I
JUST GOT MY ASS KICKED FOR YOU!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
GOD BLESS YOU, SON.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
THE LOWER CLASS ARE HERE!

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
HAVE THE INTELLECT AND
SILKY-SMOOTH VOICE OF A

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
AGH!

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
WHAT'S UP, TIGER?

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Huey: WE HAVE TO STOP IT!

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Tom: YOU FAKED THE ROBBERY.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Granddad: I'VE DONE MY PART!

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
HEY, FELLAS!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I'M KIDDING!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
OF LIFE.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
YEAH, BOY!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
RILEY!

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Tom: I WATCHED THE
SURVEILLANCE TAPE, FLIZZY -- THE

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
THEY KNOW WE'RE A COUPLE.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
IF THAT BUS CROSSES THIS LINE, IT SETS OFF A SERIES OF

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
CAUCASIAN WOMAN.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
HOW'S MY FAVORITE LITTLE
SPECIALLY ABLED NIGGA?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
THIS PLACE, THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
WON'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
BUT THE PART ABOUT THEM BEING
LONELY AND BITTER -- TRUE.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Huey: LET'S GO, RILEY.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
UHHH...

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
HOWEVER, I HAD TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION THAT SIRI DOES NOT

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Riley: NO, WE DON'T.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
WHOLE  TAPE.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
>> Granddad: LET ME SEE.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Riley: I KNOW. DAMN.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
AGH!

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Riley: OH, MAN!

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I KNOW YOU STAGED THE ROBBERY.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
GUYS.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
IT'S GREAT BEING RETARDED.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
ISN'T THERE ANYONE WHO CAN HELP
THIS MAN?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
OH, YOU'RE JUST AS HANDSOME
AS VANESSA SAID.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
SHE GOT A NIGGA FEELING ALL
UNHUNGRY AND EMOTIONAL.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
HAVE AN ACTUAL CAUCASIAN WOMAN'S
VAGINAL REGION FOR ROBERT THE

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER THOUGHT
OF THIS.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
YOU JUST COULDN'T LEAVE
ALONE, COULD YOU?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I'LL JUST TAKE A LITTLE POUR.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
FIRST, THERE WILL BE INTEGRATED DINERS AND BATHROOMS AND THEN

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Ruckus: YES, SIR, MR. KINDLY
BILLIONAIRE WHITE MAN.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
AND YOUR GRANDKIDS ARE SO
WELL-MANNERED.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I THOUGHT PEOPLE HAD LOW
EXPECTATIONS OF ME  BEFORE.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Tom: WHAT ELSE WAS FAKE?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
THEN A PINCH AND A SPLASH.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Granddad: COME ON, SQUEEZE MY
HAND, BABY.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
OHH! AGH!

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
SCHOOLS.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
WERE THE NICARAGUAN GUNS FAKE?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
OR IS IT A SPLASH, THEN A PINCH

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
WHERE THEIR DADDY AT?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
LET ME KNOW YOU'RE STILL THERE.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
NEGRO TO PENETRATE OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
AGH!

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
HOMEWORK? I CAN'T DO HOMEWORK.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
DID YOU REALLY EVEN BEAT
CHRISTIANNA?

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
UNCLE RUCKUS CAN HELP YOU WITH
THAT BROKE NIGGA.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I BET THAT NO-GOOD NIGGER
DROPPED THEM OFF WITH YOU AND

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
THERE WILL BE NIGGER QUARTERBACKS, NIGGERS WINNING

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
OKAY, DON'T SQUEEZE MY HAND IF
YOU WANT ME TO BE THE SOLE

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
WHAT KIND OF

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I'M RETARDED.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
DON'T YOU  EVER  QUESTION
WHETHER OR NOT I BEAT

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
AND A POUR?

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
ACADEMY AWARDS, NIGGERS PLAYING DOCTORS ON TELEVISION, AND

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
"RILEY, WHY WEREN'T YOU IN
CLASS?"

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
NEVER LOOKED BACK, RIGHT?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
BENEFICIARY IN YOUR WILL.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
HIS TWISTED NEGRO PENIS.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
CHRISTIANNA!

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
>> Huey: WRONG ONE.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Riley: ALSO, WE OF THE

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
"BECAUSE I GOT LOST.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I WHUPPED THAT BITCH'S ASS!

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
WE GO TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY
PRAYING WE FIND A MAN LIKE YOU.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
EVENTUALLY, EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE WON'T BE WHITE.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
SHE DIDN'T SQUEEZE.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
AGH! UH, ALL RIGHT, ROBERT.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
LOOK, IT'S FORMER
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THE

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
YOU GOT THAT?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
GET BACK!

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I'M RETARDED."

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
BUT THE NICKI MINAJ THING WAS
STAGED.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
COME ON, MAN.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
TEA PARTY ARE STRICT BELIEVERS
IN PERSONAL FREEDOM -- AS LONG

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
THERE MIGHT A REAL FUTURE IN
THIS FOR ME.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
>> Granddad: AAH!

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I'M NOT SURE WHY WE KEEP
GOING.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
WHITE MEN, YOU MUST STOP THIS BUS!

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
HAVE SOME DIGNITY.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
GET BACK WHERE YOU BELONG!

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
NEXT MAYOR OF WOODCREST,
UNCLE RUCKUS!

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
LET'S JUST PULL THE PLUG.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
SEE, SILLY?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
SHE AIN'T REALLY A CYBORG,
EITHER.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
ONLY GOOD MAN IN THERE IS JESUS.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
THIS GRAVY TRAIN IS A WRAP FOR
ALL OF US.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
AS THAT PERSONAL FREEDOM DOES
NOT INVOLVE MAN ON MAN

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING WAS GONNA
WORK OUT.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
SHE'S A NICE GIRL.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Ruckus: OH, THE FREAKNIK
CIRCUS HAS COME TO TOWN IN

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
You get in there and you do the
thing I'm talkin' about.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Granddad: WE'RE NOT PULLING
THE PLUG UNTIL YOU RECOGNIZE

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
DAMN, TOM.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST MIND YOUR
OWN BUSINESS?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Ruckus: Yeah, the only thing
they understand.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
ROBERT FREEMAN'S LIVING ROOM.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
GOOD.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
OR SMOKING OF REEFER.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS!

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Tom: I'M YOUR ATTORNEY!

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
GIRLS, THAT'S RUCKUS.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
NOW SCRAM BEFORE SOMEONE SHOOTS
YOUR BLACK ASS BY MISTAKE.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
THAT NON-SQUEEZE.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
THEREFORE, I DECIDED IT WAS OKAY
TO DO THIS FAVOR FOR MY POOR,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
WHAT ARE  YOU  DOING HERE?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Ruckus:

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
JUST PULL THE DAMN PLUG.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
WHO DO YOU THINK PAID FOR ALL
THIS?

19:38.000 --> 19:38.000
THIS  IS  MY BUSINESS!

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
IF SHE LIVES, SHE'LL BE
DEFORMED.

19:39.000 --> 19:39.000
BUT WHY?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
HE IS CRAZY!

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Ruckus: OH, OH, YES, SIR,
MR. BULL, SIR.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
THAT RETARD THING WAS A REAL

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
'CAUSE I GOT TO STAY
RELEVANT! THAT'S WHY!

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
BUT IF HE'S ROBERT'S FRIEND,
THEN HE'S MY FRIEND, TOO.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
LIFE IS
THAT?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
SUCKS RIGHT
NOW!

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
>> Granddad: RILEY!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
LONELY, DERANGED FORMER
EMPLOYER.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
DICK MOVE, GOODLOVE.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
Granddad: DAMN IT!

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT YOU NOW.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
Granddad:

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
I'LL TAKE  YOUR  WORD ON HOW
DICKS MOVE, SWEETLOVE.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Granddad: SLAVERY?!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Granddad: OKAY, THAT'S
ENOUGH.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
YOU GOT TO ACT LIKE AN IDIOT
JUST TO STAY IN THEIR

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
OH, THERE'S MY AFRICAN
PRINCE!

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
TURN BACK.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
GET ON WITH IT.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Riley: OKAY, FINE, NIGGA,
FINE.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I TOLD YOU THIS OLD DOG'S GOT A
COUPLE NEW TRICKS.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
FACES!

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Ruckus: THAT'S RIGHT -- I

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
BUT IF I CAN STAY IN JUST THE
RIGHT AMOUNT OF TROUBLE, I'LL BE

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AS
"SLAVERY."

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I GOT TO TAKE MY TIME.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
CHALK UP ANOTHER WIN FOR THE
NEGROES!

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD!

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
PLEASE.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
MY LADY IS NOT DYING UNTIL WE'VE
HAD A REAL BENEFITS TALK UP IN

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
NOW, IF ANYBODY OUT THERE HAS
ANY REASON THAT THIS NIGGA

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Huey: HEY, STOP THIS!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I THINK ABOUT IT AS INVESTING IN
PEOPLE.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
DIDN'T FORGET YOUR REQUEST.

Ruckus: OH! DID I HEAR A
NIGGA RAISING HIS VOICE IN THE

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKES!

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
SHOULD NOT MARRY HIS TELEPHONE,
WHICH SHOULD BE EVERYBODY, SPEAK

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
AND WOMEN HATE TO BE BORED.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Huey: HELP YOU DO WHAT?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
WE CAN LEARN!

FAULT, GRANDDAD.

THAT'S FAIR, RIGHT?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
GOD WILL PROTECT US.

HOW ABOUT NOT INVITING A NIGGA
THAT'S RICHER THAN YOU AND

YOU WANT TO BE MY FRIEND,
RILEY?

OHH, I WISH I'D DIED IN KOREA!

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Ruckus: WATCH YOUR STEP,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
WE BRING SLAVERY BACK TO
AMERICA.

21:05.000 --> 21:16.000
I JUST WANTED TO BE ON TV.

Granddad: OKAY, BOYS.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Huey:  FOR THE MOMENT, THE LITTLE GUY WON.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000

Riley: DAMN. OOH.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000

CAN GET BACK TO NORMAL AS SOON

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
HOW LONG BEFORE THOSE AT THE TOP FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO

YOU WERE A MANIAC!

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I'M WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000

I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THAT.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
AS POSSIBLE.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
IT WILL BE PAINLESS.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
THAT'S A BAD WORD!

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
WHITE MAN AND HIS WELL-RUN
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
>> Huey: IN RETROSPECT, IT WAS

AND ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT,
I'M HERE TO ENSURE THESE THREE

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
TRY TO MAKE A BUCK OFF OF THOSE AT THE BOTTOM?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
MY FAULT.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
Granddad: LET'S GO, KIDS.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
LET'S GO HOME.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
THE THREE OF US?!

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
OR MAYBE, JUST MAYBE THOSE AT THE BOTTOM WILL REALIZE THAT

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I JUST WANT TO THANK
UNCLE RUCKUS FOR HIS

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
WELL, WHICH ONE OF THESE LITTLE
BOYS ARE YOU TOSSING OUT?

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
IF THEY ARE, YOU'LL BE BROUGHT
UP ON FEDERAL CHARGES.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
ARE YOU IGNORING ME?!

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
THIS?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
LOOK, STOP WITH THE WAR AND

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Granddad: THIS IS WHAT I GET
FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING?!

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
LEADERSHIP -- AND, OF COURSE, TO
ROBERT FREEMAN FOR HAVING THE

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
THERE ARE TWO BODIES IN THERE.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THEY TRUST MAY NOT HAVE THEIR BEST

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Ruckus: ALL RIGHT, GET
MOVING, GET MOVING.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
>> Riley: WE CHOP 'EM UP AND

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
DUMP THE BODIES.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
SIR, YOU TELL THE PRESIDENT

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Granddad: YOU GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME!

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
AVERT YOUR EYES, AVERT YOUR
EYES.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
COURAGE TO SIGN HIS LIFE AWAY.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
>> Granddad: NO. NO.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
HA HA! NOPE, NOT AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
INTERESTS AT HEART.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
UH...

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Granddad: HEY, HOW 'BOUT MY
WHISTLE?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
COME ON OUT HERE, NIGGA!

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
JUST A NIGGA GOING TO JAIL.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
LOOK -- LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE I'M

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Granddad: NIGGA, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?!

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Huey: WHILE I RESPECT YOUR
LOYALTY, TRUST ME -- I'M RELATED

Huey: YOU DID GREAT,
GRANDDAD.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
STOP ALL THAT YELLING, AND GET
OFF MY YARD!

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
NONE OF THIS IS OKAY.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
Granddad: OKAY, BOYS, LET'S
GO HOME.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I ALMOST FORGOT -- I WON THE
BET.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I'M A TERRIBLE GRANDPARENT.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I'M NOT  ON  YOUR YARD, ROBERT!

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Sarah: OH, HONEY, I'M SO
SORRY.

21:32.000 --> 21:40.000

CHANCE TO GET OUT...

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
KIDS STUFF.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Huey: OH, MAN!

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I WAS SUCH A BITCH, AND YOU
DIDN'T DESERVE ANY OF THAT.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Granddad: UH...WHAT BET?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000

LOOK, I'M ON THE  SIDEWALK,
NIGGA!

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Granddad: BOY! HOLD ON!

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
GOOD LUCK.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
OH, WE MADE A BET THAT I
COULDN'T GET YOU GUYS TO SIGN

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I'M GONNA TURN MYSELF IN.

Ruckus: BOY, YOU NIGGAS JUST
DON'T KNOW A GOOD THING WHEN YOU

Huey: RILEY!

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Tom: YES.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
ONE DAY, YOUR NATION WILL THANK
YOU.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
AH, LET'S JUST CALL IT A
DRAW.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
HE DIDN'T THINK I COULD DO IT.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000

GOODNESS OF HIS HEART WAS GONNA

Sarah: PLEASE COME HOME.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I WON.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Granddad: STOP COMING AROUND

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Huey: RILEY, RUN!

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
PLEASE.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
AND I LOST.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I HEARD AN NBA STAR MOVED IN
DOWN THE STREET.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
WELL, WE MADE IT.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Riley:

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
HERE YOU GO, BOSS.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Riley: CAN WE GO SHOPPING FOR
A NEW PHONE NOW?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
KNEW I SHOULD'VE KILLED YOUR ASS
AGAIN.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
HUH?

WHEN YOU PUT OUT.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
LET'S GET YOU UPSTAIRS.
