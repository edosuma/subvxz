WEBVTT

00:01.914 --> 00:04.634
My hands clasped his buttocks

00:04.634 --> 00:08.194
as he carried me across the room
and pinned me against the wall.

00:08.194 --> 00:11.874
I had one foot on the bed, the
other wrapped round his hips

00:11.874 --> 00:14.594
as he lifted me by the
waist so that my other foot

00:14.594 --> 00:16.634
was wedged against the dressing table.

00:16.634 --> 00:18.874
Yeah. There.

00:18.874 --> 00:22.034
- What?
- Well, it's that.

00:23.114 --> 00:27.154
One on the bed, one wrapped round
his hips, one on the dressing table.

00:27.154 --> 00:32.073
- Three feet, Belle.
- I... moved one.

00:32.073 --> 00:37.114
In the next paragraph, you've
got three hands... each.

00:37.114 --> 00:39.474
For the record, I do it
better than I write it.

01:18.748 --> 01:21.268
You've tied yourself up in technicalities.

01:21.268 --> 01:24.388
Your readers don't want
mechanics, they want sensation.

01:24.388 --> 01:27.428
They have to think sex with
you would be mind-blowing.

01:27.428 --> 01:29.548
- Right.
- Good.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.548
- Keep going.
- Ok.

01:31.548 --> 01:35.508
"Erm... so I'm against the wall.

01:36.188 --> 01:40.148
Left foot here, right foot
there. Hands flying everywhere.

01:40.148 --> 01:42.388
- And tell us how that felt.
- Ok.

01:42.388 --> 01:45.988
"Erm... moments later, he
had me in a wheelbarrow.

01:45.988 --> 01:49.468
His hands holding my
thighs. My hands on the floor

01:49.468 --> 01:51.708
as he ran his fingers down my back."

01:51.708 --> 01:54.388
- With both hands on your thighs?
- Oh! I don't know!

01:54.388 --> 01:58.268
"Erm... his foot moved forward on
the floor as he grabbed my other hand

01:58.268 --> 02:02.028
and pushed my foot down as the
other hand reached out for his foot."

02:02.028 --> 02:07.228
It's the worst "how
to" manual ever. Sorry!

02:07.228 --> 02:10.868
Stop worrying about what goes
where. We want to know about desire.

02:10.868 --> 02:13.148
How it works, what's underneath it.

02:13.148 --> 02:15.628
What's in your head, what's in his head.

02:15.628 --> 02:19.628
You want me to explain
the fundamental nature

02:19.628 --> 02:22.588
- of the subconscious?
- Yes, please!

02:22.588 --> 02:26.148
- And while you're there, could I have the moon on a stick?
- No problem.

02:26.148 --> 02:28.108
Good. Now, fuck off.

02:29.548 --> 02:31.828
Oh, right, ok. Erm...

02:34.188 --> 02:36.068
Oh.

02:43.188 --> 02:46.348
- Bambi?
- Belle. You will never guess what.

02:46.348 --> 02:50.308
- No, I never will.
- Byron's taking me to the Gaveston.

02:50.308 --> 02:53.428
He's so sweet! I said I'd
never been and he remembered.

02:53.428 --> 02:56.068
That's sweet. Is this
the client from last week?

02:56.068 --> 02:58.628
Yeah. He's like a Duke
or a lord or something.

02:58.628 --> 03:01.588
He took me to a rave in
a disused tube station.

03:01.588 --> 03:05.548
Then we went to this kebab shop
that had a jazz club in the basement.

03:05.548 --> 03:09.388
Then we went for breakfast in an
Italian cafe and ran out without paying.

03:09.388 --> 03:12.828
- He's paying you, though, right?
- Yeah, he's got loads of money.

03:12.828 --> 03:14.788
It'll be so nice to see him again.

03:15.508 --> 03:19.468
Bambi, this is work, not a date.

03:19.468 --> 03:21.428
I know. I was just saying.

03:21.428 --> 03:23.788
Ok. Just remember he's a client.

03:23.788 --> 03:27.348
- A client.
- I know. I know what I'm doing.

03:27.348 --> 03:29.108
Oh, hang on.

03:33.628 --> 03:35.628
- Hello.
- Simon Burford.

03:35.628 --> 03:37.668
come on up.

03:41.428 --> 03:45.348
Ok. Just tell yourself he's this
nice to all the other escorts too.

03:45.348 --> 03:47.388
- Really?
- Really.

03:47.388 --> 03:51.148
- I'll see you soon, ok? Bye.
- Bye.

03:58.548 --> 04:00.548
Simon.

04:01.188 --> 04:03.108
Sorry. I was just...

04:03.988 --> 04:06.148
- Hello.
- Come in.

04:06.148 --> 04:08.628
- Yes. Simon Burford. Hello.
- Hello.

04:08.628 --> 04:10.748
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:10.748 --> 04:13.508
- Hello.
- Er...  oh, shall I take these?

04:13.508 --> 04:15.468
Oh. Yes, thank you.

04:18.668 --> 04:22.468
Now, why don't you make yourself at
home? Can I get you a glass of champagne?

04:22.468 --> 04:24.668
Well, if you've got a bottle open.

04:24.668 --> 04:27.068
- Well, not yet, but...
- Well, then, don't worry.

04:33.268 --> 04:37.388
So... nice place. How
long have you been here?

04:37.388 --> 04:39.348
About four years.

04:40.188 --> 04:42.108
And what do you do?

04:43.828 --> 04:46.348
I do everything.

04:47.468 --> 04:49.748
So, what brings you here today, Simon?

04:49.748 --> 04:54.268
I haven't had sex since I was 22.

04:55.908 --> 04:59.908
Ok. Shall we erm... sort
the formalities out first?

04:59.908 --> 05:02.588
- It'll just make things easier.
- Yes, of course.

05:02.588 --> 05:04.388
- It's all there.
-That's lovely of you.

05:05.668 --> 05:07.708
Shall we pop you in the shower?

05:08.668 --> 05:12.068
- And I'll be in there when you're ready. Shall I take this?
- Right.

05:13.988 --> 05:15.988
It's just through there.

05:20.508 --> 05:22.428
It's so sad when they are like that.

05:23.948 --> 05:28.508
But give me an hour with
him, I'll give you a new man.

05:43.428 --> 05:45.748
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.

05:45.748 --> 05:48.268
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm an actuary.

05:48.268 --> 05:50.588
- An actuary?
- Yes.

05:50.588 --> 05:54.108
I evaluated the risks in coming
here, put them on a spreadsheet.

05:55.228 --> 05:57.788
- Risks?
- It's an actuary joke.

05:57.788 --> 05:59.868
Oh. Sorry.

05:59.868 --> 06:02.468
- Are you sure you're ok with this?
- Yeah, of course.

06:02.468 --> 06:05.028
- You must get some real perverts.
- If I'm lucky.

06:05.028 --> 06:07.508
- You have to have sex with them.
- Yeah, but...

06:07.508 --> 06:09.508
- It's not like that.
- No.

06:09.508 --> 06:11.788
No. Sorry. Sorry.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.428
Would you like to kiss me? Is that ok?

06:14.428 --> 06:16.428
It's all ok.

06:23.308 --> 06:27.068
Why don't you tell me
what you'd like to do?

06:29.028 --> 06:30.908
To have sex.

06:31.748 --> 06:34.788
- How?
- Just... just ordinary.

06:34.788 --> 06:37.188
Why don't you tell me
what you'd really like?

06:37.188 --> 06:40.428
Er... to... fuck you.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.228
- How, Simon?
- I want to...

06:44.828 --> 06:46.748
Say it.

06:49.468 --> 06:51.668
I want to fuck you really hard.

06:51.668 --> 06:53.788
- Sorry.
- I'd like that.

06:59.028 --> 07:00.948
Yes, of course. Sorry.

07:06.988 --> 07:09.308
Ok. Well, here goes.

07:11.268 --> 07:13.308
Oh.

07:14.988 --> 07:16.828
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

07:19.268 --> 07:21.668
- Do you like that?
- Yeah, it's good.

07:21.668 --> 07:23.508
- You're so big.
- Am I?

07:24.548 --> 07:26.588
- Not too big? Am I hurting you?
- No, no.

07:26.588 --> 07:28.548
No, that was really good.

07:30.388 --> 07:33.868
You know before when you
told me what you wanted to do?

07:34.988 --> 07:37.588
- Why don't you tell me again?
- Er... really?

07:37.588 --> 07:39.788
Mm-hm.

07:39.788 --> 07:42.188
- I want to fuck you.
- I want that too.

07:42.188 --> 07:45.148
I want to fuck you really
hard. I want to make you come.

07:45.148 --> 07:47.588
I want to make you scream.

07:47.588 --> 07:50.028
Oh, God! Yeah! Let's do it.

07:50.028 --> 07:53.348
- Let's do it like dirty dogs.
- Yeah!

07:53.348 --> 07:55.468
You love it like this, you dirty cow?

07:55.468 --> 07:57.788
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

07:57.788 --> 07:59.788
You great big cow!

08:01.108 --> 08:04.268
- Uh-huh. Oh. - Yeah,
I'm gonna make you squeal.

08:04.268 --> 08:06.388
Oh, make me squeal. Oh, yeah.

08:06.388 --> 08:09.428
- I'm going to fuck you hard, you little piggy.
- Fuck me!

08:09.428 --> 08:11.308
Fuck me hard! Yeah.

08:11.308 --> 08:13.468
You dirty, dirty, dirty goat.

08:13.468 --> 08:16.188
Tell me you're a dirty goat.

08:16.188 --> 08:18.388
I'm so dirty!

08:18.388 --> 08:20.428
I'm a... goat. Oh, yeah!

08:20.428 --> 08:23.868
- Say you're a cock-hungry chicken.
- I'm a cock-hungry chicken.

08:23.868 --> 08:26.668
- Say you're a dirty ewe.
- I'm a "you"...  a "you" what?

08:26.668 --> 08:28.828
- It's a female sheep.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

08:28.828 --> 08:31.148
Bleat like a sheep. Bleat like a sheep!

08:49.508 --> 08:52.028
Sorry I'm late. I woke up in hastings.

08:52.028 --> 08:54.068
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:55.788 --> 08:58.468
I didn't think I was going
to see you again. Really?

08:59.228 --> 09:01.188
Why?

09:04.948 --> 09:06.868
Hop on.

09:13.748 --> 09:15.388
Whoo!

09:16.388 --> 09:20.028
Simon... can I ask, did
you grow up on a farm?

09:23.028 --> 09:27.028
- I'm sorry. I didn't want to....
- Don't worry.

09:28.188 --> 09:31.428
- I made you bleat.
- Yeah.

09:33.308 --> 09:35.548
It was fun.

09:35.548 --> 09:37.748
- It was funny. It was sweet.
- No.

09:37.748 --> 09:40.988
- No, it's not. It demeans you.
- Well, whatever works.

09:42.308 --> 09:44.228
Is that why it's been so long?

09:45.628 --> 09:49.468
My ex-girlfriend... she told everyone.

09:50.668 --> 09:53.188
I was the animal guy at college...

09:54.108 --> 09:56.068
for three years.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.868
Everyone has something they like.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.748
It's ok. Come here.

10:04.748 --> 10:07.428
Come here!

10:08.068 --> 10:10.148
Mm.

10:12.468 --> 10:14.348
Han?

10:16.228 --> 10:18.548
Hello.

10:18.548 --> 10:21.108
- Who are you?
- Aren't you supposed to be at work?

10:21.108 --> 10:23.548
- Tuesday, half day.
- You never told me that.

10:23.548 --> 10:27.348
I'm really sorry. I had
no idea. I'm her sister.

10:27.348 --> 10:29.388
You've got a sister?

10:29.388 --> 10:31.268
Oh, God!

10:33.948 --> 10:36.428
He's er... just a, sort of, boyfriend.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.068
He's going through a
bit of a difficult time.

10:39.068 --> 10:41.108
- Simon!
- Give me those back!

11:00.388 --> 11:02.268
I'm cooking. Do you want some?

11:03.148 --> 11:05.268
- What?
- I'm cooking. Do you want some?

11:05.268 --> 11:08.468
- No, I've just had a sandwich.
- How about I cook for you tomorrow?

11:10.268 --> 11:13.188
I'm sorry I'm being such a nuisance.

11:13.188 --> 11:16.028
How much longer do you think
you're going to be here for?

11:16.028 --> 11:19.628
- I'm trying to be nice here, Hannah.
- Ok. All right, tomorrow.

11:19.628 --> 11:21.788
- This is about Ben, isn't it?
- What?

11:21.788 --> 11:24.108
- No.
- I know he's your friend.

11:24.108 --> 11:27.108
Yeah, he is. He's my best friend.

11:27.108 --> 11:29.348
Can't we be a bit more grown up than that?

11:29.348 --> 11:32.068
You're married. That's
how grown up you are.

11:32.068 --> 11:35.468
- Married.
- And my husband is fucking a temp!

11:36.428 --> 11:39.708
I need something, Han.
And that something is Ben.

11:39.708 --> 11:44.068
It's like the difference
between a pushbike and a harley.

11:44.068 --> 11:47.468
Yeah. I'm sure I used to think
that when he was my boyfriend.

11:47.468 --> 11:53.188
Yeah. Did he ever do that
thing where he put his tongue...

11:53.188 --> 11:54.988
- Urgh! I'm just...
- No!

11:56.108 --> 11:59.908
Dinner at seven tomorrow. Lovely.

12:03.497 --> 12:06.737
"They say you can take the
boy out of rural lincolnshire,

12:06.737 --> 12:10.017
but you can't take the rural
lincolnshire out of the boy."

12:12.777 --> 12:14.777
I can't send that.

12:16.377 --> 12:18.777
"We want to know about desire.

12:18.777 --> 12:20.897
How it works.

12:20.897 --> 12:22.897
What's underneath it."

12:29.297 --> 12:31.737
"I always feel sorry for the nervous ones.

12:31.737 --> 12:34.217
And Simon was as nervous as they get."

12:34.217 --> 12:36.297
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.457
Hi.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.657
"Giving men like this a bit of
confidence is a public service.

12:43.417 --> 12:46.577
Once I'd encouraged him,
Simon really took control."

12:59.697 --> 13:02.097
"Sex with you would be mind-blowing.

13:07.257 --> 13:10.857
As he threw me back onto the bed,
he firmly pushed my legs open.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.417
I thought, 'I love my job.' "

13:15.577 --> 13:19.537
What? Just whatever it
takes to get it written.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.497
Ok?

13:23.497 --> 13:26.377
You can't choose what's in
your subconscious, can you?

13:29.377 --> 13:31.377
Attach.

13:31.377 --> 13:35.217
"Love, Belle. Kiss, kiss."

13:35.217 --> 13:37.257
No kiss.

13:40.617 --> 13:42.577
Hello!

13:52.777 --> 13:56.137
- Why can't I come in there?
- Because I am cooking for you.

13:59.457 --> 14:01.657
What's going on?

14:01.657 --> 14:03.977
Hey. Come up.

14:08.697 --> 14:10.577
You haven't? Jackie?

14:18.657 --> 14:20.897
Hi.

14:20.897 --> 14:22.817
Hey.

14:32.177 --> 14:34.377
- You're here.
- Yeah.

14:34.377 --> 14:36.537
- I live here.
- Yeah.

14:37.617 --> 14:39.697
- How are you?
- What, since yesterday?

14:39.697 --> 14:44.137
Fine. You know, just doing what I do.

14:44.137 --> 14:46.057
Dinner in ten minutes.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.257
- Dinner?
- What were you expecting?

14:49.257 --> 14:51.217
You know what? Don't answer that?

14:54.137 --> 14:57.497
- It was meant to be a surprise.
- Oh, it was.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.497
Venison steaks with a red
wine and blackberry reduction.

15:03.017 --> 15:05.937
- It looks delicious.
- Thanks, Ben.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.897
I can't do this.

15:10.897 --> 15:13.057
- Han.
- I should go after her.

15:13.057 --> 15:15.657
No, she just wants a reaction.

15:15.657 --> 15:18.777
Besides, it gives us a
bit more time together.

15:22.577 --> 15:25.617
Well, yeah. Good.

15:25.617 --> 15:29.657
Some time together. Alone again.

15:37.577 --> 15:41.577
I should have shown them
out of the flat, not myself.

15:45.097 --> 15:47.377
It really is... it really is very cold.

16:01.897 --> 16:03.977
Hey, babes. Are you checking up on me?

16:03.977 --> 16:06.817
No. Erm... are you in town?

16:06.817 --> 16:10.057
No, no, no. I'm just
with a client. Are you ok?

16:10.057 --> 16:13.657
No, it's fine. I was just wondering if
you were around for a drink, dont' worry.

16:13.657 --> 16:16.737
No, sorry, babes.

16:16.737 --> 16:19.337
- Ok. Bye.
- Bye.

16:31.417 --> 16:33.457
So this is me.

16:34.857 --> 16:38.857
- Is this the whole flat?
- No, there's a loo through there.

16:41.177 --> 16:43.457
It's very nice.

16:43.457 --> 16:46.217
I don't usually keep my
knickers on the boiler.

16:46.217 --> 16:48.337
Well, I usually keep mine on the fridge.

16:50.937 --> 16:53.177
Champagne?

16:53.177 --> 16:56.857
- Ketchup?
- You are properly mental, you are.

16:58.377 --> 17:00.857
I've had more fun with
you than with anyone.

17:04.097 --> 17:09.497
- Am I your best client?
- Not just with a client, with anyone.

17:09.497 --> 17:12.577
Since ever.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.857
That's a bit wrong, isn't it?

17:22.337 --> 17:24.337
Is it?

17:28.176 --> 17:30.137
See, the thing is, Bam-Bam...

17:32.617 --> 17:34.857
you make me forget that this is your job.

18:07.097 --> 18:08.937
- Hello. Who's there?
- Only me.

18:09.617 --> 18:11.777
Hello. Belle.

18:11.777 --> 18:15.537
- Everything ok?
- Yeah. No, I was just passing.

18:15.537 --> 18:18.777
- You got the new chapter?
-Oh, this is something else I'm working on.

18:18.777 --> 18:21.017
An autobiography.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.137
- Very funny.
- I'm sorry, should... ?

18:23.137 --> 18:25.337
No, I'm joking. It is yours.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.177
- Ok.
- It's really good.

18:28.177 --> 18:30.657
Good! Are you going to
stand there all evening?

18:30.657 --> 18:32.657
Have a seat.

18:37.137 --> 18:39.377
- I like the new tone.
- Thanks.

18:39.377 --> 18:41.537
It's very sexy.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.777
Steamy even.

18:43.777 --> 18:47.457
He grasped my hips and
guided himself into position.

18:47.457 --> 18:51.137
He pinned me to the
bed and fucked me hard.

18:51.137 --> 18:53.697
It's not that different, is it, the tone?

18:53.697 --> 18:56.657
Sounded like you had a real
connection with the guy, no?

18:56.657 --> 18:58.577
Something like that.

19:01.177 --> 19:03.937
- Would you like a drink?
- You're not busy?

19:03.937 --> 19:06.737
Well, not since I was
so rudely interrupted.

19:06.737 --> 19:09.497
Er... whisky?

19:09.497 --> 19:11.817
Er... yeah, ok.

19:13.097 --> 19:15.057
I'll just use...

19:17.337 --> 19:19.497
Cheers. Cheers.

19:19.497 --> 19:22.857
As long as you don't mind
mixing business with pleasure.

19:24.817 --> 19:27.097
Well, that's... what I do.

19:27.097 --> 19:29.937
This is powerful stuff. Daring too.

19:30.777 --> 19:34.177
You're really unapologetic
about your enjoyment of the job.

19:34.177 --> 19:37.937
This third paragraph is lovely.

19:37.937 --> 19:40.857
People don't normally think
of sucking cock as lovely.

19:42.657 --> 19:44.657
I do.

19:58.857 --> 20:03.657
I should erm... I should go.

20:03.657 --> 20:06.017
Jackie will probably be asleep by now.

20:06.017 --> 20:10.617
Well, next time you want to drop in
uninvited, feel free to call first.

20:10.617 --> 20:13.137
Sorry? Sorry, it was a erm... joke.

20:13.137 --> 20:15.297
A bad joke.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.097
- I've enjoyed it.
- Me too.

20:20.537 --> 20:23.057
Well, er... good night.

20:24.377 --> 20:28.137
- So, another chapter next week?
- Sure.

20:35.417 --> 20:39.697
I don't fancy him. Ok? This
is a professional relationship.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.777
There are lines you just can't cross.

20:41.777 --> 20:43.657
Looking for someone

20:49.457 --> 20:51.777
What? Ok, a bit.

20:51.777 --> 20:54.857
I fancy him a bit, but, you
know, like only in the same way

20:54.857 --> 20:57.257
that you fancy, say, one of your teachers.

21:52.937 --> 21:56.697
Fancying him and doing something
about it are very different things.

21:56.697 --> 21:58.777
Nothing will happen.

21:59.577 --> 22:01.577
Nothing can happen.

22:05.937 --> 22:08.457
What is your idea of fun, Duncan?

22:09.937 --> 22:11.177
That dress?

22:11.457 --> 22:15.497
- How would you get into something like that?
- It's got a zip. Here.

22:15.857 --> 22:19.357
