Mairead MacKenna.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.160
What the fuck is the real IRA
doing in the middle of this?

00:06.195 --> 00:08.340
the old enemy are joining
hands with the new.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.100
Natalie Fisher.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.710
- Do you work here in Budapest?
- Embassy.

00:15.870 --> 00:17.950
- Old girlfriend?
- Yeah.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.005
Leave it with me.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.715
- I knew your brother, Mairead.
- You ran across him.

00:21.716 --> 00:22.955
I ran him.

00:22.958 --> 00:26.375
- How's your son, Philip? - You mention
my son again, and I will kill you.

00:26.470 --> 00:29.075
- Drop the gun.
- Take the shot, Michael.

00:29.110 --> 00:31.290
Don't even think about it,
you fucker. You're mine!

00:42.370 --> 00:45.320
I say we pop him. One
right behind the ear.

00:45.330 --> 00:47.120
That's too good for him.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.850
- You girls all right?
- Yeah.

00:57.180 --> 00:59.850
Here. We picked that up.
There might be something on it.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.285
Whatever you do, do it quick.

01:01.290 --> 01:03.965
We all know what happens to British soldiers
in the hands of the IRA, don't we?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.730
Picked up any chatter?
Any e-mails about this attack?

01:06.735 --> 01:08.550
Levels are up, but
nothing specific.

01:08.585 --> 01:11.005
- What about Kamali?
- Should be here any minute.

01:11.010 --> 01:14.635
All right, let's work with what we have. We have
O'Riordan's movements over the last week.

01:14.665 --> 01:16.815
We have CCTV footage
from the airport.

01:16.850 --> 01:19.370
We have 24 hours... tops...
before this attack.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.940
On the ground.

01:46.310 --> 01:47.920
I just...

01:53.660 --> 01:56.370
I don't suppose you've got
somewhere I could freshen up?

02:00.930 --> 02:02.720
I take it that's a "No," then.

02:02.755 --> 02:04.170
Enough.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.720
Get up.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.290
Dig.

02:26.370 --> 02:28.340
What do you know about my son?

02:35.770 --> 02:37.750
This is how my brother died.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.260
Bullet in the back of the head.

02:40.300 --> 02:43.430
Buried in a grave he dug himself.

BRITISH EMBASSY, BUDAPEST

04:27.900 --> 04:30.430
- You got anything?
- One a second.

04:31.970 --> 04:35.290
Phone call made from the airport
less than an hour before the attack.

04:35.325 --> 04:38.135
- To who?
- Moukhtar Mousawi,

04:38.170 --> 04:40.790
a prominent businessman
in the Lebanese community here.

04:40.825 --> 04:43.020
Runs the car dealership
in District 13.

04:43.055 --> 04:44.475
- Heads up.
- Leo.

04:44.510 --> 04:47.445
- I came as soon as I could.
- Thanks for coming. How's Ester?

04:47.550 --> 04:48.870
Safe.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.460
You know that guy?

04:51.380 --> 04:55.330
Moukhtar Mousawi. He's one of
Al-Zuhari's fixers in Europe.

04:55.365 --> 04:57.360
- Right.
- They took Locke.

04:59.362 --> 05:01.560
Then Moukhtar Mousawi will
know where they're holding him.

05:01.565 --> 05:04.270
Which makes him our only
solid lead to the attack.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.560
It's risky, but
I could talk to him.

05:07.570 --> 05:10.120
Mm-mm. Time for talk is over.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.530
Mikey, let's go.

05:11.540 --> 05:14.110
- Richmond, you get us that address?
- Yup.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.830
You believe in dreams?

05:31.330 --> 05:32.750
Yes.

05:49.170 --> 05:50.660
Keep it.

05:56.310 --> 05:58.060
I had a bad dream.

06:12.370 --> 06:16.640
<i>The things you lost on your recent
holiday in Beirut have been found.</i>

06:28.870 --> 06:30.270
You all right?

06:31.540 --> 06:32.880
Yeah.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.120
Why wouldn't I be?

06:37.830 --> 06:40.040
Those couple of shots you missed.

06:40.570 --> 06:42.750
Just asking.

06:44.470 --> 06:47.640
Yeah. I checked in
with the embassy doctor.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.420
She's running some tests.

06:49.900 --> 06:53.440
That's good.
What do you think it could be?

06:53.475 --> 06:56.830
- Mental? Physical?
- I don't know.

06:57.490 --> 06:59.710
I've seen it on
guys I came up with.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.740
Physically, you're fine, but...

07:01.970 --> 07:04.390
mentally... no.

07:05.340 --> 07:08.465
You've reached the top of your game
and the pressure and the emotional cost,

07:08.495 --> 07:09.280
it just...

07:13.100 --> 07:15.710
It's not long before it
starts to slip away, you know?

07:17.790 --> 07:21.070
- You got nothing to worry about.
- Well, cheers, mate.

07:21.110 --> 07:24.690
- You're nowhere near the top
of your game. - You fucking asshole.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.980
Is that what's making you
think about these diamonds?

07:32.230 --> 07:33.540
Maybe.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.820
But you don't get out,
you get got, right?

07:37.900 --> 07:39.320
Copy that.

07:50.630 --> 07:55.000
Did you ever hear the one about the Englishman
and the Irishman and the Arab?

07:55.930 --> 07:58.660
Yeah? Tough crowd.

08:12.570 --> 08:15.470
- Don't do this.
- Stay where the fuck you are.

08:19.770 --> 08:21.970
This is between you and me.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.630
I liked your brother.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.290
You liked Francie?

08:28.970 --> 08:31.565
You fucking turned him.
Set him up.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.730
Made him betray the people
he loved. The cause.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.832
It was a dirty war, Mairead.

08:36.866 --> 08:39.188
That night, I went to warn him.

08:39.222 --> 08:41.510
To protect your fucking source.

08:41.590 --> 08:43.190
What are you doing?

08:44.580 --> 08:47.620
- Why did you even bring him here?
- This has nothing to do with you.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.040
You heard her. Fuck off.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.120
Put the weapons down.

09:02.050 --> 09:04.321
They are all dogs,
but we need them.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.880
If you want what
al-Zuhari has promised,

09:07.990 --> 09:10.120
we should find out what he knows.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.150
Fuck it.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.010
He's nothing to me.

09:18.530 --> 09:21.980
You guys are planning to attack NATO,
you better get your act together.

09:26.430 --> 09:28.100
He knows nothing.

09:30.030 --> 09:31.930
He's trying to play us.

09:37.330 --> 09:39.450
We have to be sure.

09:41.580 --> 09:43.860
- Fuck. I hate waiting.
- Yeah.

09:44.030 --> 09:45.970
So, Locke had a kid, huh?

09:45.980 --> 09:50.480
He did. The SAS played
hardball in Northern Ireland,

09:50.515 --> 09:52.210
- as you know.
- Yeah.

09:52.650 --> 09:54.820
The IRA killed Locke's son.

09:57.390 --> 09:58.980
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

09:59.230 --> 10:01.830
- And you knew?
- Yeah, I suppose I did.

10:02.820 --> 10:05.270
But we all have things we
don't talk about, right, mate?

10:06.280 --> 10:07.880
Yes, we do.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.310
There's Mousawi.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.110
How do I look?

10:13.850 --> 10:16.015
Like a man who has
more money than taste.

10:16.050 --> 10:19.090
- That's good. That's exactly
what I was going for. - Well, it works.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.400
Leather...

10:34.670 --> 10:36.430
and it has all the 4 tires.

10:36.450 --> 10:38.400
There. Is all 4.

10:40.170 --> 10:42.640
You like, Mother? This?

10:43.370 --> 10:44.970
Like the color?

10:49.571 --> 10:51.071
SzÃ©p ugye?
(Nice, isn't it?)

10:52.146 --> 10:56.172
- Nem magyar. (Not Hungarian) Speak English?
- Ah. The car. Is a beautiful thing.

10:56.205 --> 10:57.440
It is.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.252
- Moukhtar Mousawi.
- Grant Hawkins.

11:00.287 --> 11:02.585
- I love Americans.
- So do I.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.610
So many songs about cars.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.710
Bruce Springsteen,
"Cadillac Ranch."

11:06.745 --> 11:09.110
Janis Joplin, "Mercedes Benz."

11:09.140 --> 11:11.595
Yep. Romance of the road.

11:11.630 --> 11:16.030
- What brings you to Hungary,
Mr. Hawkins? - Fiancee.

11:16.050 --> 11:20.660
- You're getting married?
- Yeah. Third time lucky.

11:20.950 --> 11:24.370
Americans... the only people
with more wives than Arabs.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.369
Yeah, but we only
get one at a time.

11:26.470 --> 11:29.450
- Except in Utah.
- That's true.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.990
You're a funny man, Moukhtar.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.490
- May I?
- Please. Be my guest.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.950
Thank you.

11:45.030 --> 11:48.605
Let me tell you, my friend, this is
one of the safest cars you could drive.

11:48.635 --> 11:52.670
Heh. Why is that?
Because it's made of metal?

11:53.755 --> 11:56.850
- You have children? - Me and
my fiancee are thinking about it,

11:56.885 --> 11:59.130
but I'm still a
bit of a kid myself.

11:59.730 --> 12:01.690
You would like to take
it for a test drive?

12:01.725 --> 12:04.020
I could arrange for
one of my sales...

12:05.450 --> 12:07.500
- Don't mind me, mate.
- You'll do.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.250
What...

12:11.900 --> 12:13.720
What's going on?

12:29.050 --> 12:31.850
We were tipped off by
a man called Gray in Beirut

12:31.885 --> 12:34.240
that somebody was after NATO intel.

12:35.410 --> 12:39.127
Every single base and installation
is on full alert.

12:39.130 --> 12:40.615
And the NATO hub?

12:40.650 --> 12:44.080
- Anything else you want to fucking
tell him? - He'll die here.

12:44.470 --> 12:46.260
So, what is it you're after?

12:46.370 --> 12:49.070
Logistics data?
Base operational details?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.200
Well, sadly, you're out of luck.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.690
The access protocols
have been changed...

12:56.400 --> 12:58.160
on my orders.

13:01.130 --> 13:02.895
What is the new protocol?

13:02.930 --> 13:06.130
From where I'm standing, that's
hardly an incentive, is it?

13:07.030 --> 13:08.500
You're right.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.390
Wait.

13:32.070 --> 13:33.910
I know a better way.

13:38.630 --> 13:42.355
I was going to save this till the moment
before I pulled the trigger.

13:45.670 --> 13:48.520
I know who killed your son.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.290
Give us the protocol

13:54.930 --> 13:56.940
and I'll give you the name.

14:13.430 --> 14:15.960
Let me open it.
I want to open it.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.200
Give me the keys.

14:19.570 --> 14:22.040
- Thanks, Dad.
- Let me know when you get there.

14:24.270 --> 14:25.550
Locke.

14:33.570 --> 14:36.435
- Who is this?
- For your sins, Philip...

14:37.930 --> 14:39.530
What do you want?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.070
<i>Payback.</i>

14:42.140 --> 14:43.580
Anthony!

14:53.000 --> 14:54.350
Yeah.

14:58.630 --> 15:01.690
20 years and it still
hurts, doesn't it?

15:01.725 --> 15:04.240
You must be human after all.

15:04.450 --> 15:08.380
At least your wife survived. Lucky.

15:08.930 --> 15:11.230
She'll get to pick up your pension.

15:12.430 --> 15:14.850
I suppose you could
call it surviving.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.730
In a wheelchair, quadriplegic,

15:17.900 --> 15:20.160
60% burns.

15:20.170 --> 15:24.550
What do you boys call it?
Collateral damage?

15:26.330 --> 15:29.720
- You know who planted the bomb?
- The same man as built it.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.420
There was only one other
device with the same signature.

15:32.455 --> 15:36.202
Canary Wharf. 96.

15:38.230 --> 15:41.510
- I could point you straight at him.
- You're going to kill me anyway.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.180
You still want to know?

15:51.130 --> 15:54.110
He died because of who you are...

15:55.170 --> 15:56.960
what you did.

15:59.470 --> 16:02.890
You know, when I close my
eyes, I don't just see my boy.

16:05.300 --> 16:08.400
I feel his breath on my neck.

16:10.530 --> 16:13.530
I feel the warmth
he used to give me.

16:16.470 --> 16:18.535
There was a time
I would've put a bullet

16:18.570 --> 16:20.840
into every bastard that
helped kill him, but...

16:23.370 --> 16:28.090
Anthony's dead. Francie's dead.

16:30.170 --> 16:32.200
You're living in the past, Mairead.

16:34.030 --> 16:35.620
That war's done.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.910
You don't really
believe that, do you?

17:02.600 --> 17:06.180
- This is kidnapping!
- It's funny you mention kidnapping.

17:06.214 --> 17:08.589
You know the name
Philip Locke? Huh?

17:19.030 --> 17:21.555
There we go. Brake works.

17:21.589 --> 17:24.750
- You think there's any other safety features
on this car? - I don't know. Let's find out.

17:24.810 --> 17:28.900
Let's do that.

17:30.370 --> 17:31.970
What are you doing?

17:32.640 --> 17:34.970
At the moment, looks like
we're going backwards.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.000
All right, brakes!

18:05.700 --> 18:08.135
These models got
passenger airbags, Mikey?

18:08.170 --> 18:12.330
- I think there's only one way
to find out, mate. - Mm. Me, too.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.840
No, no. Wait.

18:17.410 --> 18:20.800
No, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop!

18:20.835 --> 18:22.650
I can't stop now!

18:25.100 --> 18:26.690
Boy, that was
a clincher, wasn't it?

18:30.070 --> 18:31.470
Waiting.

18:32.430 --> 18:34.630
- All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.145
If Al-Zuhari finds out...

18:37.180 --> 18:39.320
I'm not gonna tell him. Mikey?

18:39.325 --> 18:40.833
Mum's the word, mate.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.690
There you go. So, he's
not gonna find out.

18:43.370 --> 18:45.450
Cat got your tongue? Come on.

18:45.670 --> 18:48.670
An abandoned factory.
District 9.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.040
Fuck.

18:57.810 --> 18:59.835
- You all right?
- You see where it's coming from, mate?

18:59.870 --> 19:02.260
Oh, yeah, let me stick my head up
and take a look, mate.

19:05.730 --> 19:08.170
- Nothing. Nothing! Fucking engine.
- Shit.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.640
Fuck.

19:09.770 --> 19:12.595
- Here. - Oh, fucking throw
that at him great idea.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.110
Throw it at you.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.560
Fuck. Fuck.

19:17.220 --> 19:20.280
Fuck. Goddamn. Up, Mike. Up.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.330
Fuck.

19:28.670 --> 19:30.370
- You see him?
- He's jumping out.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.720
Here he comes, Mikey.
He's coming toward us.

19:33.762 --> 19:35.600
As soon as he changes...

19:37.280 --> 19:38.610
Go.

19:54.270 --> 19:57.150
Uhh. You think he's IRA?

19:58.670 --> 20:02.450
- He's Vory.  - What the fuck
is that? Sounds like an evil elf.

20:03.805 --> 20:06.840
Vory v Zakone. Russian Mob.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.710
You see these tattoos?

20:08.790 --> 20:11.335
They're like a CV. They tell you
everything except his name.

20:11.370 --> 20:15.940
- How the fuck do you know all that shit?
- And this one, he's an assassin.

20:16.460 --> 20:18.400
- I got that, Mike.
- Yeah?

20:18.435 --> 20:19.210
Yeah.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.730
That's the man. Arkady Ulyanov almost
certainly sent the Vory to kill you.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.720
Because we killed
his son in Colombia.

20:26.330 --> 20:28.500
Come on. We've
killed heaps of dudes.

20:28.535 --> 20:31.839
They've all been someone's son.
What makes that guy such a badass?

20:31.840 --> 20:34.200
Because he's the head of the
most fierce mafia gang in Russia.

20:34.215 --> 20:36.550
He has the resources
of a small country.

20:36.585 --> 20:38.700
And he loved his son.

20:40.570 --> 20:44.830
- You're fucked then. - I'm fucked?
I'm fucked? Why am I fucked?

20:44.840 --> 20:46.555
- You shot him first.
- You shot him as well.

20:46.590 --> 20:49.270
Yeah, but I only shot him
to make sure he was dead.

20:49.305 --> 20:52.470
You shot him first, so, all the evil elfs
are gonna come after your ass.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.490
It's "Elves," Not "Elfs."

20:55.130 --> 20:57.100
- You got anything?
- Yeah.

20:57.105 --> 21:00.040
Two abandoned factories
that fit with what Mousawi told us.

21:00.075 --> 21:01.800
- It's going up?
- Big screen.

21:02.030 --> 21:05.500
- That's it? - Well, that's the armored
car from the airport.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.290
That's it. Let's move.

21:07.300 --> 21:11.920
Today is the anniversary. Today is the holy day
Al-Zuhari referred to on the tape.

21:11.935 --> 21:14.620
The attack could happen
anywhere, any moment.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.000
Let's go.

21:18.330 --> 21:20.040
Heads up, bud.

21:26.530 --> 21:29.745
- You'll get nothing from him.
- Just shoot the fucker.

21:29.780 --> 21:32.240
A bullet and a shallow
grave buy us nothing.

21:34.270 --> 21:37.995
- He has propaganda value.
- Suit yourself.

21:38.030 --> 21:41.240
Used to be a time you joined
the army to see the world, eh?

21:41.275 --> 21:44.510
Now you get to star in your
own snuff movie instead.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.730
I guess that's progress.

21:46.820 --> 21:51.250
Why don't you tell your friends
who Francie MacKenna really was, Mairead?

21:51.410 --> 21:54.110
- That he worked...
- Shut your filthy mouth.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.985
When you're done,

21:58.020 --> 22:01.160
be sure to send a copy of the
video to what's left of his wife.

22:04.050 --> 22:05.920
Come on. It's time.

23:16.420 --> 23:18.050
In position on your two.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.720
Mikey, go.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.160
Fuck.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.290
Scott! Stonebridge!

23:47.710 --> 23:50.355
- They're here. - Nobody's going
to enter now, my friend.

23:50.390 --> 23:53.430
Look at the camera.
Look at the camera. Look!

23:53.720 --> 23:56.140
Say after me. Say after me.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.350
- Sorry, I didn't quite...
- Say after me!

24:03.100 --> 24:04.580
I'll kill him!

24:05.180 --> 24:09.190
Shoot him, Scott.
Take the shot.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.755
I can't.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.950
- Take the shot.
- I can't, boss. I got no shot.

24:22.750 --> 24:24.150
Do it!

24:34.400 --> 24:35.670
Fuck!

24:36.260 --> 24:38.130
- You all right?
- Yeah.

24:38.770 --> 24:41.160
- Still got it, Mikey.
- Really?

24:44.050 --> 24:46.760
- You all right, boss?
- Sergeant.

24:47.790 --> 24:51.510
- Good? Good?
- Yeah.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.320
Her crew's on the loose with 3 vans.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.010
They might be packed
full of Semtex.

25:16.025 --> 25:19.880
- What are their targets?
- No idea, but it's happening today.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.520
They're looking to crack
the NATO hub somehow.

25:33.555 --> 25:37.310
Get hold of Covee. Make sure the protocols
are changed immediately.

25:37.345 --> 25:39.530
- Sir.
- Uhh. Thank you.

25:40.070 --> 25:43.970
Then get me the location of every
access point within 100 miles of here.

25:44.060 --> 25:47.650
- What's the NATO hub?
- It's the gateway to all allied intelligence.

25:47.740 --> 25:50.045
We have to assume they're
gonna download intel

25:50.080 --> 25:52.350
on the target or targets
they intend to attack.

25:52.385 --> 25:54.797
Gray was right.
Dalton was right.

25:54.832 --> 25:57.175
They're targeting a NATO base.

25:57.210 --> 25:59.535
Papa airbase is the main
NATO base in Hungary, yeah?

25:59.570 --> 26:02.250
- Yeah. - Well, tell them we have
a Code One level threat.

26:02.830 --> 26:04.292
Imminent.

26:27.270 --> 26:30.430
- Are we set?
- Keep your wits about you.

26:45.310 --> 26:47.460
Hold on. That's one of the vans.

26:47.660 --> 26:49.130
Where is it?

26:51.500 --> 26:53.650
Josef Square.
A block from here.

26:53.660 --> 26:55.895
- Move. Evacuate the building.
- Boss. - Sir.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.710
- They have to be targeting
the embassy. - Fuck.

26:57.715 --> 26:59.580
And alert the authorities.

27:00.850 --> 27:03.400
There's two more vans.
Eastern European. Both green.

27:03.435 --> 27:05.470
One light, one dark.

27:06.230 --> 27:09.375
- Why the embassy? - Sir? Covee's
on his way to the morgue.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.490
His assistant Natalie was
found dead this morning.

27:11.525 --> 27:15.280
- That can't be a coincidence.
- Get hold of Covee now.

27:33.680 --> 27:34.990
Sir.

27:38.430 --> 27:40.565
It's a mobile mortar rig.
Secure it.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.920
- MacKenna's at the scene
with another hostile. - Copy that.

27:52.660 --> 27:54.290
- Mike, Mike.
- Here they fucking come!

27:54.325 --> 27:55.980
- Contact!
- Fuck!

28:10.200 --> 28:12.010
- Mikey.
- Coming to you.

28:20.020 --> 28:23.660
The other vans.
They're triangulating the embassy.

28:29.530 --> 28:30.890
Move!

28:31.560 --> 28:32.990
Moving!

28:39.600 --> 28:42.840
Incoming! Cover!

28:48.320 --> 28:50.190
You. Get out. Go. Move.

28:50.890 --> 28:52.290
Fuck.

28:52.810 --> 28:54.930
Bravo team, I have
the other two vans.

28:54.965 --> 28:57.740
One at Leopold Park,
one at Szechenyi Bridge.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.060
Sergeant, leave.
Now. That's an order.

29:04.100 --> 29:05.485
- Mike!
- I'm here!

29:05.490 --> 29:07.320
I'll run for the park!
You go for the bridge!

29:07.330 --> 29:09.600
Yeah, roger that.
Come on, come on.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.790
Let's go.

29:12.390 --> 29:15.100
Leo, find somewhere
safe and you stay there.

29:21.730 --> 29:24.100
For fuck's sake,
put Covee on now!

29:33.640 --> 29:35.010
Fuck.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.770
That's one down.

30:01.890 --> 30:03.270
Fuck. Man.

30:24.110 --> 30:26.370
Group Captain, this is
Sergeant Richmond, Section 20.

30:26.405 --> 30:27.670
MacKenna's people are
attacking the embassy.

30:27.705 --> 30:28.980
- We do not have...
- Listen.

30:29.570 --> 30:31.935
I have oversight of all NATO troops

30:31.970 --> 30:34.620
transiting through Papa
airbase to Afghanistan.

30:41.800 --> 30:46.130
They killed my assistant
to get her access card.

30:53.430 --> 30:54.750
Mike!

30:57.880 --> 30:59.310
No!

31:03.640 --> 31:05.020
Mike, no!

31:07.650 --> 31:10.960
Zero, you have
mortars inbound! Fuck!

31:17.800 --> 31:19.110
No!

31:46.500 --> 31:50.480
Can we get some help here?
Help this man.

32:25.450 --> 32:26.840
Julia?

32:28.700 --> 32:31.320
Get me a medic in here now. Now!

32:32.000 --> 32:33.310
Yeah, roger that.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.285
Excuse me.
Oi. Excuse me.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.480
Excuse me. I need your help. Come here.
Do you speak English? English?

32:42.520 --> 32:44.020
Come here. Follow me.

32:44.910 --> 32:46.520
Upstairs. Upstairs.
Come here.

32:53.230 --> 32:56.420
- Can somebody give me a hand in here?
- Yeah, I'm right here, boss.

32:58.070 --> 33:00.530
Come here. Come here.
Get in here.

33:01.890 --> 33:03.217
Julia.

33:04.270 --> 33:06.910
Stay still. You're gonna be OK.

33:08.280 --> 33:11.860
- Julia, it's all right. It's all right.
Stay still. Stay still. - What happened?

33:11.900 --> 33:14.000
You don't have to worry about
that. We're gonna take care of it.

33:17.460 --> 33:19.865
There's a NATO hub access point

33:19.900 --> 33:22.270
in the secure part of the embassy.

33:22.305 --> 33:24.990
That's impossible.
They would've briefed us on it.

33:25.780 --> 33:29.730
For Alpha Eyes Only. Covee.

33:29.740 --> 33:32.990
He has much higher
clearance than is standard.

33:33.025 --> 33:35.320
- Where is it? - Basement.
- Basement.

33:41.870 --> 33:43.980
I guess that's you and me even.

33:47.850 --> 33:50.650
We've had casualties down here?
We get message.

34:00.950 --> 34:03.965
- Jesus Christ.
- Paramedics' IRA.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.140
- She all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:05.175 --> 34:06.400
She's alive.

34:06.480 --> 34:09.770
There's an access point in the basement.
We need to get there right now. Come on.

34:09.804 --> 34:11.389
I've got this. You go.

34:11.420 --> 34:14.070
- She gains access, we're fucked.
- Shit.

34:19.210 --> 34:21.940
- How did you get down here?
- New access protocol.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.120
We've no time
for fucking heroes.

34:31.810 --> 34:33.810
If they've changed the
access protocol, how...

34:33.844 --> 34:36.969
The Brits been lying to us
for 300 years. Locke was lying.

34:44.110 --> 34:47.960
- Stop! Mikey!
- Oi! Stop.

34:52.380 --> 34:54.170
- Is that him?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

34:54.330 --> 34:56.630
No. Shit.
Move. Move.

35:11.530 --> 35:13.820
C'mon to fuck, Mairead.
What's taking so long?

35:19.130 --> 35:21.690
- Come on, come on.
- We've done our bit.

35:25.230 --> 35:26.600
Move.

35:31.550 --> 35:33.540
Shit. Here they fucking come.

35:36.570 --> 35:37.890
It's done.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.940
Fuck. Come on. They
must have got Brendan.

35:51.130 --> 35:53.260
Shit. Fuck.

36:00.900 --> 36:02.830
Go. Take it.

36:03.390 --> 36:05.590
Go on. Fuck off before
I change my mind.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.390
I'm only doing what Francie
would've done, right?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.920
You're a better man
than he ever was.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.520
Good luck.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.510
You fuckers never
know when to stop.

36:22.020 --> 36:23.660
Fuck! Grenade! Move!

36:28.900 --> 36:30.330
Fuck!

36:49.090 --> 36:50.670
You should be dead.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.950
You're not far off yourself.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.290
And for what?

36:56.990 --> 36:59.375
Enough AK, Semtex, and Stingers

36:59.410 --> 37:01.810
to get your lot out
of Ireland forever.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
Do you really think Al-Zuhari
will come good on that, Mairead?

37:08.660 --> 37:12.290
Listen to the Brit call
the Arab a shifty bastard.

37:14.790 --> 37:16.240
You stay there.

37:19.030 --> 37:22.600
Give me the name of the bomber,
the man who killed my son,

37:22.635 --> 37:25.650
and I promise you, Mairead,
I will do everything I can for you.

37:26.830 --> 37:30.890
You turned one MacKenna.
You'll not turn another.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.420
You tell me and
Francie's secret is safe.

37:33.455 --> 37:37.170
- Why do you think I stayed?
- Let Paidraig go?

37:38.280 --> 37:41.210
Once I'm dead, you've
no reason to tell anyone.

37:44.080 --> 37:47.730
- I'll do it anyway.
- No. You won't.

37:49.990 --> 37:52.440
Because you did like my brother.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.625
Mikey. You got this?

37:55.660 --> 37:58.110
- Yeah. - I'm gonna go for a friend.
- Yeah. Roger that.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.580
Everyone fucking loved Francie.

38:24.990 --> 38:26.090
What the fuck?

38:27.610 --> 38:29.930
The name of the man
who killed my son.

38:36.350 --> 38:39.740
- Oh, shit. Colonel.
- I have this.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.030
The name.

38:52.540 --> 38:55.860
See, the old war is not done
for you yet, either, is it?

38:57.780 --> 38:59.740
Poor, little toy soldier.

39:03.570 --> 39:05.570
I can do better than a name.

39:08.160 --> 39:11.920
How'd you like to speak to the man
who killed your wee Anthony?

39:14.710 --> 39:16.090
What?

39:17.630 --> 39:19.070
My phone.

39:23.260 --> 39:25.510
- Boss.
- It's fine.

39:27.690 --> 39:29.540
This is between you and me.

39:31.490 --> 39:32.695
No!

39:32.730 --> 39:34.760
- Come here.
- She was gonna shoot you!

39:34.795 --> 39:36.850
Kamali! Come here.

39:36.970 --> 39:38.875
The gun. Put it down.
Put it down.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.190
- Put it down.
- She was gonna shoot you.

39:44.570 --> 39:45.940
Shit.

39:53.590 --> 39:54.950
Bitch.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.310
Come here. Come on.

40:25.390 --> 40:28.785
- Do we have any more painkillers?
- Yeah. For Julia?

40:28.820 --> 40:31.760
Yeah. She'll be sore when
the morphine wears off.

40:34.060 --> 40:36.420
- Here you go.
- Cheers.

40:40.710 --> 40:43.020
Is now the time to talk
about dinner?

40:47.670 --> 40:50.385
Um...look, Martinez, I'm...

40:50.420 --> 40:53.100
I'm flattered. I really am.

40:53.135 --> 40:55.830
No, no. It's cool.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.100
- Ha!
- Yup.

41:02.170 --> 41:04.850
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Yup. Here we go.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.830
Is there something I can
get for you, Sergeant Scott?

41:07.865 --> 41:10.665
- No, it's all good. I'll get it from the other one.
- OK. Thank you.

41:10.700 --> 41:13.330
Look like you got your hands
full there, Special Agent.

41:13.940 --> 41:16.642
- Here we go. Scott, it's just...
- I know what it is, dude.

41:16.677 --> 41:19.177
- for Richmond... - All good.
- Yup. - Uh-huh.

41:19.212 --> 41:21.440
- OK. - Be gentle.
- Yup. Good talk.

41:21.475 --> 41:24.870
- Been a long time.
- Great. That's good.

41:25.280 --> 41:30.600
- He's not the talking type, right?
- Oh, no. Damien, he is the soul of discretion.

41:30.635 --> 41:32.050
He's...

41:33.850 --> 41:35.565
- Hey, Scott.
- Yeah.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.950
- What about the last of MacKenna's men?
- I don't know. He got away.

41:38.980 --> 41:40.930
Cops are on.
I'm gonna grab her.

41:41.720 --> 41:43.700
Come on. Come here.

41:48.620 --> 41:50.320
What a mess.

41:59.490 --> 42:01.890
- You all right, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

42:04.190 --> 42:06.420
You'd tell me if you
weren't, wouldn't you?

42:07.270 --> 42:08.830
Yeah, of course.

42:11.410 --> 42:15.653
- You spoke to the doctor?
- Yeah, she's running some tests.

42:17.190 --> 42:19.860
- Routine checkup, at my request.
- She said.

42:21.710 --> 42:23.860
Anything else
you want to tell me?

42:25.780 --> 42:27.700
No, sir. It's all good.

42:30.310 --> 42:33.350
You and Scott are at the tip
of the spear, Michael. It's not easy.

42:34.210 --> 42:36.310
I know. I was that soldier.

42:39.710 --> 42:41.160
Yeah, I understand.

42:41.220 --> 42:43.510
And what happened
between me and MacKenna...

42:45.620 --> 42:47.340
was ancient history.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.380
You lost family as well.

43:07.740 --> 43:10.210
It never goes away, does it, sir?

43:13.240 --> 43:15.470
Did it help? Killing Hanson?

43:19.280 --> 43:20.790
I forgave him.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.300
That's not what I asked.

43:27.140 --> 43:29.573
Go on. You can tell me.
MacKenna's dead.

43:29.608 --> 43:31.960
I'll never find the bastard.

43:33.110 --> 43:37.150
Yeah. Yeah, it helped.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.300
That's what I was afraid of.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.430
You're a good soldier, Michael.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.840
Thank you, sir.

43:49.300 --> 43:53.620
The next time I tell you to take the shot,
you take the shot.

43:56.160 --> 43:57.690
Yes, sir.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.560
So?

44:18.160 --> 44:21.930
This is... ahem...
exceptional quality.

44:23.410 --> 44:26.770
- Where did you get it?
- Private supplier.

44:30.460 --> 44:32.330
You got a rough idea of its value?

44:32.365 --> 44:34.140
At current market,

44:34.330 --> 44:38.320
200. 250.

44:39.270 --> 44:41.450
- Thousand?
- Yes.

44:43.610 --> 44:46.250
- Dollars?
- Yes.

44:48.430 --> 44:50.780
How many do you have?

44:52.320 --> 44:55.890
That, my friend, is a secret. Heh.

44:56.230 --> 44:59.900
- Fuck me. - Language, please.
- Sorry.

45:00.130 --> 45:03.850
- Yeah, we'll get the tech people to look over it again.
- That's a good idea.

45:04.190 --> 45:06.160
Make a seat and drink, will you?
Thanks.

45:06.410 --> 45:09.560
I should've known about this attack.
They should've told me.

45:10.300 --> 45:12.300
You don't think they trust you?

45:12.600 --> 45:15.080
This was part of something
bigger, wasn't it?

45:15.115 --> 45:17.592
To access information
on NATO bases?

45:17.627 --> 45:20.070
The hub is the key to everything.

45:21.430 --> 45:23.640
- Evening, guys,
- Hey.

45:25.700 --> 45:29.025
- What's that? - It's the number of the
ex-girlfriend you were looking for.

45:31.370 --> 45:33.820
- Special Agent.
- Sergeant.

45:37.040 --> 45:39.155
So, it's just
been confirmed...

45:39.190 --> 45:41.850
MacKenna's people cloned
a drive at the embassy.

45:43.240 --> 45:46.295
Well, they decrypt it,
NATO's operationally compromised

45:46.330 --> 45:49.550
and the whole of Europe is exposed
to an attack by Al-Zuhari.

45:49.585 --> 45:53.824
When it's activated, the cloned drive
broadcasts a unique trackable signal.

45:54.100 --> 45:56.390
- We picked it up an hour ago.
- Where?

45:57.740 --> 46:00.980
- Russia.
- That's Arkady Ulyanov's backyard.

46:01.160 --> 46:03.730
We're fucked. We're on
top of his shit list.
