-Hello?
-We're closed.

42:44.039 --> 42:46.564
Oh, it's just,
the-the sign says open.

42:46.607 --> 42:50.002
Sorry, owner trumps sign.
Good night.

42:51.046 --> 42:52.395
It always worked.

42:52.439 --> 42:54.049
I-I'm celebrating.

42:54.093 --> 42:57.662
One drink, and
I'm out of your hair, please.

42:59.185 --> 43:01.753
Fine. What? What do you want?

43:01.796 --> 43:04.538
Hmm. Well, uh, let me think.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.846
Let me see.

43:07.889 --> 43:09.587
Allow me.

43:09.630 --> 43:11.676
You're the type of guy
that orders a bourbon

43:11.719 --> 43:15.810
when he really wants
a white wine

43:15.854 --> 43:20.685
and to cozy up
to some boring-ass nonfiction.

43:25.820 --> 43:27.735
You're very good.

43:27.779 --> 43:30.346
I've done this for a while.

43:36.701 --> 43:40.313
The truth is, there's no reason
that I'm aware of,

43:40.356 --> 43:44.230
in the history of time
that this should fail,

43:44.273 --> 43:46.580
unless something's really wrong.

43:46.624 --> 43:49.452
Boy, you really got me pegged.
[chuckles]

43:49.496 --> 43:51.541
Except the, uh, nonfiction part.

43:51.585 --> 43:54.457
Me, I'm more of
a sci-fi guy myself.

43:54.501 --> 43:55.676
You?

43:58.026 --> 44:00.246
Not really the spacey types?

44:01.203 --> 44:03.902
Most definitely not.

44:03.945 --> 44:05.686
Come on.

44:05.730 --> 44:10.082
We could all use a dash of extra
with all this ordinary.

44:10.125 --> 44:11.779
You don't think
we're alone out there.

44:11.823 --> 44:14.695
I think we're alone down here.

44:14.739 --> 44:17.132
[laughs]

44:17.176 --> 44:21.180
For me, uh,
science is aspirational.

44:21.223 --> 44:23.791
Science fact, science fiction.
Love it all.

44:23.835 --> 44:27.708
Especially the strange,
the, uh, less explainable.

44:27.752 --> 44:31.364
And I'm not talking about
UFO's scooping up cattle

44:31.407 --> 44:34.280
or putting their
John Hancock's on cornfields.

44:34.323 --> 44:36.804
I'm talking about, uh...

44:36.848 --> 44:39.589
Well, this here.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.246
W-Wait.

44:44.290 --> 44:46.335
Hold on now. That-that...

44:46.379 --> 44:49.121
[forced laughter]

44:49.164 --> 44:53.342
Funny thing, I used to have
a camera system down here.

44:53.386 --> 44:55.518
Damn thing glitched so much

44:55.562 --> 44:57.738
you'd think this bar
was for ghosts.

44:57.782 --> 45:00.219
[chuckles] Yeah, yeah.
That's probably it.

45:00.262 --> 45:02.917
Uh, all the same.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.529
Federal agents!
Hold it right there!

45:06.573 --> 45:08.270
[indistinct radio chatter]

45:08.314 --> 45:10.316
Don't move.

45:10.359 --> 45:11.926
Hands where I can see them.

45:11.970 --> 45:13.014
What is this?

45:13.058 --> 45:14.363
Law enforcement.

45:14.407 --> 45:16.539
I'm gonna need you two
to come with me.

45:17.497 --> 45:18.367
[handcuffs click]
