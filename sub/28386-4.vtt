00:00.164 --> 00:01.706
<i>Previously on "The Bold Type"...</i>

00:01.758 --> 00:02.959
So tell me, what do you want to write?

00:02.993 --> 00:04.500
I don't write for the dot com.

00:04.594 --> 00:06.393
I found my new full-time writer.

00:06.429 --> 00:07.916
Welcome to the digital team, Jane.

00:07.951 --> 00:09.029
We're going to have a lot of fun.

00:09.064 --> 00:10.999
You want to design? Be a designer.

00:11.034 --> 00:13.868
There is this creative side
that I've recently reconnected with.

00:13.903 --> 00:17.020
An old friend of mine
has a design seminar.

00:17.055 --> 00:19.473
<i>- I could make a call.
- That would be amazing.</i>

00:19.509 --> 00:20.807
Tia is my campaign manager.

00:20.843 --> 00:23.007
- Kat is here to...
- Just to volunteer.

00:23.042 --> 00:25.146
Even though they want us to
believe that we don't have

00:25.181 --> 00:28.403
the power to change things,
we actually do and we will.

00:28.438 --> 00:31.152
Linda and I were thinking
that you should run.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:47.235 --> 00:49.169
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:50.639 --> 00:51.972
Wow.

00:52.307 --> 00:54.474
- Did you bring me dinner?
- Yeah.

00:54.509 --> 00:56.242
Fifth night in a row you've
worked through dinner.

00:56.278 --> 00:57.978
- You've got to eat sometime.
- It will be over soon.

00:58.013 --> 00:59.479
My application is due in three days.

00:59.514 --> 01:01.914
Then you will officially
be a fashion student.

01:01.950 --> 01:04.184
I mean, it's not fashion school,
it's a design seminar,

01:04.218 --> 01:08.588
but it's... pretty competitive
so the dress needs to be great.

01:08.623 --> 01:14.260
And it needs something, I just...
I don't know what.

01:14.296 --> 01:16.629
Thank you for this dinner.
It's very helpful.

01:16.664 --> 01:18.931
Happy to be of service.

01:18.967 --> 01:21.868
You know,
if you want to be of service...

01:23.837 --> 01:25.871
You know I'm pretty sure that

01:25.906 --> 01:27.406
board members are expressly forbidden...

01:27.441 --> 01:30.109
Shut up.

01:30.144 --> 01:32.311
Mm.

01:32.346 --> 01:34.279
It's midnight.

01:34.315 --> 01:36.081
No one's here.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.421
See, this is working for me.

01:42.456 --> 01:44.156
I feel a creative breakthrough coming.

01:49.730 --> 01:51.130
Oh!

01:54.235 --> 01:56.035
Are those brass buttons?

02:05.178 --> 02:07.512
Wow, Jane,
really stepping up that fashion game.

02:07.547 --> 02:09.146
Oh, yeah? This old thing?

02:09.181 --> 02:11.115
Found it in the fashion closet.

02:11.151 --> 02:12.450
Hey, what about your dress?

02:12.485 --> 02:14.118
When am I going to get to try it on?

02:14.154 --> 02:16.187
The one you're making for
your design class application.

02:16.222 --> 02:18.589
Well, as soon as
my dress convinces Oliver,

02:18.624 --> 02:21.825
who is my highly regarded
fashion professional,

02:21.861 --> 02:24.262
that I am worthy of the
Julian Grant seminar

02:24.297 --> 02:26.264
then, uh, then it's all yours.

02:26.299 --> 02:27.665
- You're worthy.
- Thank you.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.167
Great.

02:29.202 --> 02:31.602
So this is district one, huh?

02:31.637 --> 02:33.538
Yeah, plus NYU, Tribeca.

02:33.573 --> 02:36.074
Basically here to downtown.

02:36.109 --> 02:37.508
Just the tip of Manhattan.

02:37.544 --> 02:40.478
Oh, my god, you're going to be
the councilwoman for just the tip?

02:40.513 --> 02:41.606
Oh, yeah.

02:41.981 --> 02:44.281
What does a councilperson
for just the tip do?

02:44.316 --> 02:45.950
Well, a lot, actually.

02:45.985 --> 02:48.385
They make laws like Congress
but on a city level.

02:48.420 --> 02:50.888
They can create affordable housing,

02:50.923 --> 02:53.356
hold law enforcement accountable.

02:53.392 --> 02:55.593
They can actually have a pretty
big impact on the community.

02:55.628 --> 02:57.260
But what about "Scarlet"?
Would you have to leave?

02:57.296 --> 02:58.829
Oh, well, I don't know.

02:58.864 --> 03:01.932
Maybe, but I haven't even
made a decision yet.

03:01.968 --> 03:03.533
Well, I think you would be a great

03:03.569 --> 03:05.035
councilperson, but what do I know?

03:05.071 --> 03:08.205
Thanks. I think I might, too.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.774
All right, Madame Secretary.
Where we off to?

03:10.810 --> 03:13.543
Uh, we are going this way
towards politics.

03:13.579 --> 03:15.079
Gather around. Come on.

03:15.114 --> 03:16.847
Pitch meeting is about to begin.

03:16.882 --> 03:19.382
Okay, whoo, I had an extra shot
of B12 this morning

03:19.418 --> 03:20.784
so I'm feeling more myself than ever.

03:20.820 --> 03:22.085
Hit me.

03:22.121 --> 03:24.954
Uh, "Game of Thrones" versus
"Stranger Things" sex positions.

03:24.990 --> 03:27.657
What is hotter:
the dragon or the Upside Down?

03:27.692 --> 03:29.659
I say go with the goddess. Next.

03:29.694 --> 03:31.861
Um, I was thinking a retro collection of

03:31.896 --> 03:33.563
Jacqueline's best pieces
throughout the years

03:33.599 --> 03:35.599
in conjunction with her
ten year anniversary gala.

03:35.634 --> 03:39.402
Okay, that's cool,
but with Alex's Jeff story going viral,

03:39.438 --> 03:41.438
we kind of need to raise
the bar a little bit

03:41.473 --> 03:43.740
and I'm not sure
Jacqueline's party does that.

03:43.775 --> 03:45.275
What about if I give you
the date night column

03:45.310 --> 03:47.210
and I can send you on a date
with a pack of models?

03:47.546 --> 03:48.578
Huh?

03:48.614 --> 03:51.014
So I'm going to send you plus the models

03:51.049 --> 03:53.350
to this new place in Ridgewood
called The Rage Room.

03:53.385 --> 03:54.984
- The Rage Room?
- Yeah, it's really cool.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.353
It's like, you go and you like,

03:56.388 --> 03:57.920
break consumer objects
with a baseball bat.

03:57.956 --> 04:00.089
Kind of like an
anti-capitalist theme park.

04:00.125 --> 04:01.924
It's fun.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.225
Jane?

04:03.261 --> 04:04.460
What's up? You feel the rage?

04:04.495 --> 04:06.495
- I really do.
- Groovy.

04:08.533 --> 04:10.032
Toby, thank you so much
again for meeting us

04:10.067 --> 04:11.233
on such short notice.

04:11.269 --> 04:12.601
- I appreciate it.
- Of course.

04:12.637 --> 04:14.303
You saved my ass on
the DeBlasio campaign.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.038
She's like a political superhero.

04:16.072 --> 04:18.240
Hey, but Kat had those kids enraptured

04:18.276 --> 04:20.176
by zoning laws at the rally.
It was ridiculous.

04:20.211 --> 04:22.278
Well, it was your idea
to ply them with IPA.

04:22.313 --> 04:23.812
Okay, but I didn't think
of gluten-free pizza.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.441
That was all you.

04:25.650 --> 04:30.386
So, uh, if I do decide to run,
what needs to happen?

04:30.421 --> 04:31.987
Well, first you're going
to need seed money.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.822
So a little fundraising.
Then you're going to need

04:33.857 --> 04:35.624
a thousand signatures to
get your name on the ballot.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.259
- And we're almost there.
- Okay.

04:37.295 --> 04:38.527
And those need to be filed
by the end of the week.

04:38.563 --> 04:41.063
Uh, and then you'll need a platform.
Why you?

04:41.098 --> 04:42.731
Well, the incumbent Lawrence Reynolds

04:42.766 --> 04:45.333
is letting developers
destroy the neighborhood.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.836
Okay, well that's why people
shouldn't vote for Reynolds

04:47.871 --> 04:49.971
but not why they should vote for you.

04:50.007 --> 04:51.687
So, why?

04:53.443 --> 04:55.143
We're, uh, working on it.

04:55.179 --> 04:56.544
Great, and while you do,

04:56.580 --> 04:58.213
I'll run a quick oppo research report.

04:58.248 --> 05:00.381
- Great.
- Oppo research?

05:00.417 --> 05:02.084
Yeah, it will give us
an idea of what Reynolds

05:02.119 --> 05:03.651
might use against you in the race.

05:03.687 --> 05:06.221
Yeah, like if you've got an ex lover
who's an international spy.

05:06.835 --> 05:07.860
How did you know?

05:09.026 --> 05:10.358
- We'll clean that up.
- Yeah.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.827
Uh, but really we just want to make sure

05:11.862 --> 05:13.228
your registration is up to date,

05:13.263 --> 05:15.097
your residency, that kind of thing.

05:15.132 --> 05:18.967
All right. And I can keep
working full-time while I run?

05:19.002 --> 05:20.368
Well, if you've got
an understanding boss

05:20.403 --> 05:22.303
and you can run on fumes, then probably.

05:22.339 --> 05:26.173
Sleep's overrated and, uh,
I'll find out about the boss.

05:26.209 --> 05:27.407
You're one of us already.

05:33.216 --> 05:36.083
Oh, hey, Carly. What you reading today?

05:36.119 --> 05:38.753
Um, what's it called?
"Fifty Shades of..."

05:38.788 --> 05:40.254
- What?
- Don't mind her.

05:40.289 --> 05:42.056
She's a natural Maya Rudolph.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.691
She's actually reading
"Three Dark Crowns"?

05:44.727 --> 05:46.693
I don't know. Uh, okay.

05:46.729 --> 05:49.063
And these are the dazzling dresses

05:49.098 --> 05:50.430
worthy of ten years of Jacqueline?

05:50.466 --> 05:52.032
I mean, not all of them.

05:52.068 --> 05:53.700
I gave her a few to try on today.

05:53.736 --> 05:55.136
But, uh, don't worry because I have

05:55.171 --> 05:56.871
a bunch more coming in this afternoon.

05:56.906 --> 05:59.874
This whole place is going to be
just, dazzle city.

05:59.909 --> 06:01.441
Okay, yeah, and, uh,

06:01.477 --> 06:03.210
call Zac Posen, have him send his best.

06:03.246 --> 06:05.279
Remind him, this is Jacqueline
Carlisle we're talking about.

06:05.314 --> 06:06.880
Yeah, I'm on it.

06:06.915 --> 06:09.149
Hey, um, real quick.

06:10.619 --> 06:14.053
I know that you just, um,
got custody of Carly,

06:14.089 --> 06:17.157
but has she been out of school all week?

06:17.192 --> 06:19.259
Yeah, she was up late
and I don't have the gene

06:19.295 --> 06:22.262
that lets me say no
to one more "Queer Eye."

06:22.298 --> 06:23.897
- Okay.
- You know, why don't you worry

06:23.932 --> 06:25.766
a little bit less about Carly
and a little more about

06:25.801 --> 06:28.368
that dress you're submitting
for the Julian Grant seminar?

06:28.404 --> 06:30.270
I can't write my recommendation
until I see it.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.406
I just have a couple last-minute tweaks.

06:32.441 --> 06:33.907
Great.

06:41.950 --> 06:43.283
How we feeling?

06:43.319 --> 06:45.118
Bat, sledgehammer?

06:45.153 --> 06:46.419
Definitely sledgehammer.

06:46.454 --> 06:47.853
So you guys come here often?

06:47.888 --> 06:49.622
Oh, yeah. Patrick turned us onto it.

06:49.657 --> 06:50.956
We follow him on Instagram.

06:50.991 --> 06:52.491
Our lives have never been the same.

06:52.527 --> 06:54.927
Yeah, Patrick has that effect on people.

06:57.365 --> 06:58.731
You're up.

07:04.104 --> 07:06.339
Enjoy.

07:24.237 --> 07:26.614
That felt so great.

07:27.194 --> 07:30.362
So I only have a few more questions.

07:30.397 --> 07:32.664
What about your job makes you enraged?

07:32.699 --> 07:35.800
Well, I once worked with
a photographer who made me

07:35.836 --> 07:37.535
wear a bikini for eight hours straight

07:37.571 --> 07:39.571
- in freezing cold weather.
- Yeah, similar.

07:39.606 --> 07:42.640
I had a photographer who made me
ride a mechanical bull

07:42.676 --> 07:44.109
in "Daisy Duke" shorts.

07:44.144 --> 07:45.878
My thighs still haven't recovered.

07:45.913 --> 07:48.113
But, I don't know, it's nothing too bad.

07:48.148 --> 07:49.714
It's not like we worked
for Pamela Dolan.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.351
Yeah, I hear she can be tough.

07:55.356 --> 07:57.622
What?

08:01.428 --> 08:05.029
Off the record.

08:05.064 --> 08:08.900
I know she is considered a genius

08:08.935 --> 08:12.403
and her work lines the halls of MoMA...

08:14.040 --> 08:17.942
But a friend of ours worked
with her a few years ago.

08:17.977 --> 08:20.244
When she came back from
her Pamela Dolan shoot,

08:20.280 --> 08:22.813
her eyes were red from crying.

08:22.848 --> 08:24.081
She had bruises.

08:24.117 --> 08:25.582
I mean, she was really shaken up.

08:25.618 --> 08:28.419
Oh, my God. What happened?

08:28.454 --> 08:30.054
We don't know.

08:30.089 --> 08:31.923
She never really opened up about it.

08:31.958 --> 08:34.424
But whatever it was,
it was obviously bad enough.

08:34.460 --> 08:35.927
It sent her back to Missouri.

08:48.148 --> 08:52.095
Hey, Oliver.
Um, can I ask you a question?

08:53.320 --> 08:54.695
Yes?

08:56.423 --> 09:01.292
Pamela Dolan. What's she like?

09:01.327 --> 09:05.429
Uh, tough as nails but talented as hell.

09:05.464 --> 09:08.098
Honestly, it's been years
since I've worked with her.

09:08.133 --> 09:11.902
I mean, she's been so busy these days,
we don't even try.

09:11.937 --> 09:13.443
Why?

09:15.641 --> 09:20.177
Um, I did a date night
with a group of models and...

09:20.213 --> 09:23.547
And you heard the rumors?

09:23.583 --> 09:25.216
You know about the rumors?

09:25.251 --> 09:28.619
Nothing substantial,
and I hear rumors about everybody.

09:31.224 --> 09:33.757
But my two cents? Drop it.

09:33.792 --> 09:36.193
A woman as powerful as Pamela

09:36.229 --> 09:39.296
would do whatever it takes
to protect her career,

09:39.332 --> 09:41.297
even if it means destroying yours.

09:41.333 --> 09:45.135
And they're only rumors.

09:45.170 --> 09:48.538
Well, luckily it's worth it.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.480
Uh, hey, Patrick? Do you have a second?

09:57.515 --> 09:59.315
Yeah, yeah, of course. What's up?

09:59.351 --> 10:00.784
I was wondering
if I could set a meeting.

10:00.819 --> 10:02.685
I want to run something
by you and Jacqueline.

10:02.721 --> 10:06.422
Okay, well I'm here right now
so you can run it by me.

10:06.458 --> 10:09.259
Okay, um... Okay.

10:09.294 --> 10:10.727
So you know that city councilwoman

10:10.763 --> 10:11.995
that I was volunteering for?

10:12.030 --> 10:14.164
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, she dropped out.

10:14.199 --> 10:16.633
And I'm thinking about taking her place.

10:16.668 --> 10:19.502
- Wait, you want to run?
- Maybe.

10:19.537 --> 10:23.105
- Oh, wow. I love that idea.
- Oh, really?

10:23.141 --> 10:24.574
The dot com could follow you
on the campaign trail.

10:24.609 --> 10:25.841
I mean, this is the kind of thing that

10:25.877 --> 10:27.176
just generates content and content.

10:27.211 --> 10:29.845
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Oh.

10:30.882 --> 10:32.181
What are you doing?

10:32.216 --> 10:34.116
I'm polling our readers.

10:34.152 --> 10:35.718
This is an interactive marketing moment.

10:35.754 --> 10:37.820
Oh, my God,
I'm turning myself on a little.

10:37.855 --> 10:39.689
Okay, well,
maybe we should slow our roll

10:39.724 --> 10:41.257
because I don't really know
if I'm going to do it yet

10:41.293 --> 10:42.792
and I still haven't
spoken to Jacqueline.

10:42.827 --> 10:44.694
Hey, Jacqueline,
did you hear that Kat...

10:44.729 --> 10:48.398
Kat is thinking about running
for city council, I see.

10:48.433 --> 10:49.731
Nice.

10:49.767 --> 10:51.065
I think it's a great idea.

10:51.101 --> 10:52.734
I totally gave her the go-ahead.

10:55.005 --> 10:57.572
Oh, well, we'd be sorry to lose you here

10:57.608 --> 11:01.710
but I think the city
would be lucky to have you.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.913
And so I vote: yes.

11:06.183 --> 11:08.550
Oh. Hey, RJ. What's up, man?

11:08.585 --> 11:10.452
Yeah, yeah. I can meet you.

11:10.487 --> 11:11.886
- Keep me posted.
- I will.

11:14.391 --> 11:16.224
No, Natalie, We are not setting you

11:16.259 --> 11:18.794
anywhere close to Carl. Yeah.

11:18.829 --> 11:22.396
All right, okay.
All right, see you there.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.099
- Bye-bye.
- Jacqueline?

11:25.135 --> 11:28.369
- Is this a good time?
- Uh, yeah. What's up?

11:28.404 --> 11:30.504
I was just wondering if
you saw that we're running

11:30.540 --> 11:32.240
some of your old articles on the dot com

11:32.275 --> 11:34.342
in celebration of your ten
years as editor and chief.

11:34.377 --> 11:36.077
I did.

11:36.112 --> 11:39.180
I especially loved that piece
you did on the Gotham Girls.

11:39.216 --> 11:41.649
Made me want to join
a roller derby team.

11:41.684 --> 11:45.019
So, uh, I stumbled upon a story

11:45.055 --> 11:47.688
and I would really love
to write it for the magazine.

11:47.724 --> 11:52.126
Oh, but you write for the dot com now.

11:52.162 --> 11:55.796
I know, but I think
this piece could be huge.

11:55.832 --> 11:58.065
And it's complicated,
so I really need it

11:58.100 --> 12:01.369
to go to somebody that I trust.

12:04.273 --> 12:06.741
- What's the story?
- Uh, Pamela Dolan.

12:06.776 --> 12:08.242
The photographer?

12:08.277 --> 12:11.679
I think she's been abusing her models.

12:11.714 --> 12:14.114
Emotionally, physically,
psychologically.

12:14.149 --> 12:15.949
Well, I've heard that she's difficult

12:15.985 --> 12:17.951
to work for, but abusive?

12:17.987 --> 12:19.420
Well, women are just as capable

12:19.455 --> 12:20.888
of bad behavior as men are.

12:20.923 --> 12:22.690
Of course, but who are your sources?

12:22.725 --> 12:25.459
Well, I spoke
to a bunch of models yesterday

12:25.495 --> 12:27.027
and they were telling me
about these rumors.

12:27.062 --> 12:28.596
Rumors?

12:28.631 --> 12:30.264
Have any of them suffered any abuse?

12:30.299 --> 12:32.900
Yes, one of them had a friend who did

12:32.935 --> 12:35.102
and after her incident,
she moved to Missouri

12:35.137 --> 12:37.104
so she's been a little
tough to track down.

12:37.139 --> 12:40.240
I know I can't do this piece
without any solid evidence,

12:40.276 --> 12:42.642
but I really feel like
there's a story here.

12:42.677 --> 12:45.379
And I've never done a serious
investigation, but you have,

12:45.414 --> 12:49.416
so I was hoping maybe you
could help me navigate it?

12:49.451 --> 12:53.086
Well, the thing about
investigative reporting is

12:53.122 --> 12:56.489
that, you know, it takes a lot of time

12:56.525 --> 12:59.192
and resources and a lot of other things

12:59.228 --> 13:01.661
that I just don't have the
ability to dig into right now.

13:01.696 --> 13:04.597
I could dig in and get the ball rolling.

13:04.633 --> 13:07.099
Good. Go for it.

13:07.135 --> 13:08.600
Andrew, hold all my calls.

13:08.636 --> 13:11.170
I'm going to try on more gala dresses.

13:11.906 --> 13:14.173
Well, Oliver, it's that time.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.674
Okay, Red.

13:15.709 --> 13:17.743
I know that we sometimes
call ourselves teammates

13:17.778 --> 13:19.345
and I might be moody but I will never

13:19.380 --> 13:21.147
be able to sync periods with you.

13:21.182 --> 13:23.549
Well, I do dream of the day that we can.

13:23.584 --> 13:26.452
Um, I meant that it's time
for me to show you my dress

13:26.487 --> 13:27.987
so you can write me that recommendation.

13:28.022 --> 13:30.756
Oh, uh, okay. Impress me.

13:30.791 --> 13:34.226
Okay, so.

13:34.262 --> 13:38.330
The V-neck and the bishop
sleeves are a nod to boho-chic

13:38.365 --> 13:40.631
which is making a big comeback and, um,

13:40.667 --> 13:42.834
well, I did fall in love with
the detail around the waist.

13:42.869 --> 13:44.436
And the tassels, I mean,

13:45.289 --> 13:47.238
who doesn't love a tassel?

13:49.742 --> 13:51.376
So?

13:51.411 --> 13:53.778
I admire the effort.

13:53.813 --> 13:57.115
Um, you know,
there's a lot going on here and...

13:57.395 --> 13:58.516
Um.

13:58.751 --> 14:00.352
It's Carly.

14:00.387 --> 14:02.553
She wants me to pick her up
early from school.

14:02.589 --> 14:04.522
You know, I... I don't know, Red.

14:04.557 --> 14:06.824
I'm not sure we should base
the recommendation on this dress.

14:06.860 --> 14:10.728
There are like eight different
ideas happening at once

14:10.763 --> 14:13.531
and none of them tell me
who Sutton Brady is.

14:17.770 --> 14:19.904
I will need to see the reworked cover

14:19.939 --> 14:21.739
before the end of day,
and can somebody please

14:21.774 --> 14:23.474
get the headline writers a thesaurus?

14:23.510 --> 14:25.175
There must be
another word for "quickie."

14:25.211 --> 14:26.477
- You got it.
- They used it three times.

14:27.714 --> 14:30.247
Oh... hey... oh... uh, Jacqueline?
I have a guest for you.

14:30.282 --> 14:33.150
- It's RJ Safford.
- Oh.

14:33.185 --> 14:35.920
Oh, my... wow. RJ.

14:35.955 --> 14:39.189
What a surprise.
I can't believe you're here.

14:39.225 --> 14:41.559
What, did they run out of scotch
in Prague or something?

14:41.594 --> 14:44.495
Ah, I'm too busy for Prague,
too busy for scotch.

14:44.530 --> 14:47.264
But how could I miss your party?

14:47.299 --> 14:49.900
Especially since I'm the one
who is introducing you.

14:49.935 --> 14:51.368
Really? What an honor.

14:51.404 --> 14:52.569
You know, I did want to talk to you

14:52.604 --> 14:54.874
about the fall double issue.

14:54.909 --> 14:55.939
Okay.

14:55.974 --> 14:59.709
Patrick feels it's not
going to be cost effective.

14:59.745 --> 15:02.979
Um, well that's not
really Patrick's domain.

15:03.015 --> 15:05.916
Uh, I know, but these days,
lines are blurring.

15:05.951 --> 15:07.584
We're just hoping we can
spend more of that money

15:07.619 --> 15:10.587
on additional video
content for the dot com.

15:10.622 --> 15:14.958
Patrick has been doing
an incredible job.

15:14.993 --> 15:16.793
Sorry. Just trying to compute.

15:16.828 --> 15:19.196
I wasn't aware that you and
Patrick were collaborating.

15:19.231 --> 15:20.864
He's a big part of "Scarlet."

15:20.899 --> 15:22.566
He's just going to walk me
through his plan later today.

15:22.601 --> 15:25.902
Okay, I will, uh,
have Andrew check my schedule.

15:25.938 --> 15:27.070
That's not necessary.

15:27.105 --> 15:28.672
It's a preliminary conversation.

15:28.707 --> 15:31.407
You have got a big speech
to write for your gala.

15:31.443 --> 15:35.111
Ten years as editor and chief.
What an achievement.

15:36.715 --> 15:39.616
RJ.

15:39.651 --> 15:41.918
It feels like there is something

15:41.954 --> 15:44.921
that you're not telling me.

15:44.957 --> 15:47.023
Really looking forward to your speech.

15:55.533 --> 15:58.701
Okay, so, what did we find?

15:58.736 --> 16:01.704
Misdemeanor arrest last
year for punching a guy

16:01.739 --> 16:03.371
when you were out with your girlfriend.

16:03.407 --> 16:05.774
Oh, yeah. Well, he totally deserved it.

16:05.810 --> 16:08.477
A video of you smoking
what is almost certainly a joint

16:08.512 --> 16:10.278
outside of a Lana Del Rey concert.

16:10.314 --> 16:13.181
Oh, Lana Del Rey.
It's gonna be tough to explain.

16:13.217 --> 16:14.249
Yeah, good luck with that.

16:14.284 --> 16:16.819
Also a dropped Poli Sci class
in your sophomore year of NYU.

16:16.854 --> 16:19.688
- Uh-huh.
- And a terminated pregnancy in 2013.

16:23.193 --> 16:25.928
Um.

16:25.963 --> 16:28.998
I'm sorry, I thought, uh,
medical records were private.

16:29.033 --> 16:32.167
They are, but you wrote
about having an abortion

16:32.202 --> 16:33.868
on a message board a few weeks after

16:33.903 --> 16:35.537
under the screen name "KitKat4"

16:35.572 --> 16:38.740
which we were able to
link back to your profile.

16:41.178 --> 16:43.378
So, the question
you need to ask yourself is,

16:43.413 --> 16:46.181
"How comfortable am I
with any of this coming out?"

16:46.216 --> 16:48.316
And if the answer is less than 100%,

16:48.352 --> 16:51.586
is it worth it?

16:58.377 --> 17:00.313
Oliver did not hate your dress.

17:00.343 --> 17:02.911
He hated it.

17:02.946 --> 17:04.846
Hello, Oliver hated my dress so

17:04.882 --> 17:06.848
maybe you should rethink me
as being your campaign designer.

17:06.884 --> 17:07.949
You're so dramatic.

17:07.984 --> 17:11.819
Well, I'm kind of rethinking
myself as candidate, so.

17:11.854 --> 17:13.188
What? Why?

17:13.223 --> 17:15.856
Uh, opposition research came in.

17:15.892 --> 17:20.494
Uh, they dug up my arrest,
footage of me smoking a joint,

17:20.530 --> 17:25.567
and a dropped Poli Sci class,

17:25.602 --> 17:31.272
and an abortion I had when I was 20.

17:31.308 --> 17:32.574
Oh.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.612
- We didn't know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

17:37.647 --> 17:39.447
Why didn't we know that?

17:39.482 --> 17:41.716
It's not something you just
drop into conversation.

17:41.751 --> 17:43.918
We're the queens of dropping
things into conversations.

17:43.953 --> 17:45.853
Yeah, that's true. I don't know.

17:45.888 --> 17:50.124
Uh, I just...
I just didn't know how to bring it up.

17:50.159 --> 17:51.726
We get it.

17:51.761 --> 17:52.793
You... you don't have
to tell us everything.

17:52.829 --> 17:56.597
Yeah. But you can.

17:56.632 --> 17:58.265
If you want to.

18:01.637 --> 18:03.237
Do you remember Paul Attie?

18:03.272 --> 18:06.240
You know, my best friend in college?

18:06.275 --> 18:10.310
Well, we co-hosted a radio
show together at WNYU,

18:10.346 --> 18:14.083
and we just scored this huge
interview with DJ Khaled.

18:14.118 --> 18:17.748
And no, I did not
hook up with DJ Khaled.

18:18.487 --> 18:21.921
So we were celebrating at the studio

18:21.957 --> 18:25.659
and it wasn't like a planned thing,

18:25.694 --> 18:29.630
and I thought he pulled out
in time but he didn't.

18:29.665 --> 18:34.334
I know, we should have
used a condom, but...

18:34.370 --> 18:35.969
I mean, there was never any question.

18:36.004 --> 18:39.640
I had to get an abortion.

18:39.675 --> 18:43.677
But he was great.
He split the cost with me,

18:43.712 --> 18:45.479
he came with me to the clinic.

18:45.514 --> 18:47.847
So Toby thinks that they
would use this against you?

18:48.540 --> 18:49.549
I mean, it's your body.

18:49.585 --> 18:50.850
It's your choice.

18:50.886 --> 18:52.586
Yeah, this is New York City, 2019.

18:52.621 --> 18:54.354
Exactly. Things are weird right now.

18:54.390 --> 18:57.323
And when it comes
to abortion, it just...

18:57.358 --> 18:59.325
I mean, it feels like it's 1973

18:59.360 --> 19:02.128
except we have bots
and trolls and doxxing.

19:02.164 --> 19:04.030
Well, there's always going to be people

19:04.065 --> 19:06.046
with really loud opinions but
we'll help you tune them out.

19:06.146 --> 19:09.535
- Mm-hmm.
- I should talk to Tia.

19:09.570 --> 19:12.305
I had sex on that last night.

19:12.340 --> 19:14.231
Hmm, well done.

19:15.610 --> 19:16.676
How?

19:19.247 --> 19:21.647
And don't forget, we have an
Elie Saab waiting in the wings.

19:21.683 --> 19:23.649
Okay.

19:23.685 --> 19:26.186
Oh, and I saw Carly in your office.

19:26.221 --> 19:27.844
She is so cute.

19:28.323 --> 19:29.422
How you doing with all that?

19:29.457 --> 19:31.324
It's uh...

19:32.527 --> 19:33.992
It's intense.

19:34.028 --> 19:36.995
Not that I'm complaining.

19:37.031 --> 19:38.698
It's nice to be busy.

19:39.767 --> 19:41.300
You and I?

19:41.336 --> 19:42.835
They're going to have
to wheel us out of here.

19:44.806 --> 19:49.007
I'm not so sure about that.

19:49.043 --> 19:50.602
Is this about Patrick?

19:51.679 --> 19:53.746
Jacques, you and I have seen

19:53.781 --> 19:56.716
a lot of shiny new things come and go.

19:56.751 --> 19:58.851
Did I tell you that this shiny new thing

19:58.886 --> 20:00.653
thinks our double issue is excessive?

20:00.688 --> 20:03.655
And it seems that RJ is listening.

20:03.690 --> 20:06.023
I don't know, it just reminds me of

20:06.059 --> 20:10.695
when RJ brought Tina in
to push Adele Ritter out.

20:10.731 --> 20:13.264
Why would RJ listen to Patrick?

20:13.299 --> 20:15.032
He's not even old enough to rent a car.

20:15.068 --> 20:16.868
Yeah, but dot com is performing

20:16.903 --> 20:19.070
and it's hit all of its targets
ahead of schedule

20:19.105 --> 20:21.373
and that's a good incentive to listen.

20:21.408 --> 20:25.777
Do you really think that
Patrick is coming for your job?

20:25.812 --> 20:28.713
I think Patrick is going
after the entire magazine.

20:28.749 --> 20:32.550
I think that he wants to make
"Scarlet" purely digital

20:32.586 --> 20:33.951
and I think it's only a matter of time

20:33.987 --> 20:36.053
before RJ gets on board.

20:38.391 --> 20:40.023
Wow.

20:42.995 --> 20:45.295
Let's look at the Elie Saab.

20:50.969 --> 20:53.036
I know that's Oliver's
lunch but what do you say

20:53.071 --> 20:54.805
we make it our lunch and have a picnic?

20:54.840 --> 20:56.440
Oh, that sounds so great right now,

20:56.475 --> 20:58.609
especially because
Oliver hated my dress.

20:58.644 --> 21:01.311
- Really?
- Yeah, he said it wasn't me.

21:01.346 --> 21:03.614
Well, he may not have loved the dress,
but he loves you.

21:03.649 --> 21:05.716
I'm sure he'll still write you
a recommendation.

21:05.751 --> 21:07.850
I don't want to get into the
seminar because he loves me.

21:07.886 --> 21:09.084
I want to get in because I'm good.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.820
You are good.

21:10.855 --> 21:12.588
Why don't you get some
other big name in fashion

21:12.624 --> 21:14.156
to write you a letter of recommendation?

21:14.191 --> 21:15.991
Dana Jacobs said that
if I want to design,

21:16.027 --> 21:18.060
I should be a designer;
maybe she'll write me a letter.

21:18.095 --> 21:21.297
She'd be good,
but didn't your meeting go pretty rough?

21:21.332 --> 21:23.599
Yeah, but I wouldn't even

21:23.635 --> 21:25.468
be trying to design
if it weren't for her.

21:25.503 --> 21:26.636
You know, maybe she'll be flattered

21:26.671 --> 21:29.305
that I took her advice.

21:29.975 --> 21:31.607
- I love you.
- Enough to give me two French fries?

21:31.643 --> 21:33.075
- No.
- Oh.

21:35.779 --> 21:37.446
Jacqueline?

21:37.481 --> 21:39.415
She waited until I was in the
bathroom to interrupt you.

21:39.450 --> 21:40.882
Jacqueline is working
on her speech for the gala.

21:40.918 --> 21:42.084
Respect the process, Jane.

21:42.119 --> 21:43.452
Andrew.

21:43.487 --> 21:44.820
Shh. It's okay.

21:44.855 --> 21:47.056
Okay.

21:48.792 --> 21:51.226
Okay, so I've been working on this

21:51.262 --> 21:53.829
and I think I have
something pretty solid.

21:53.864 --> 21:56.698
I found the name of a model
who showed up to a shoot

21:56.733 --> 21:58.033
with rope burns on her arms after

21:58.069 --> 22:00.102
- working with Pamela Dolan.
- Mm.

22:00.137 --> 22:01.636
It's a start.

22:01.672 --> 22:03.973
So I got the ball rolling

22:04.008 --> 22:06.341
and we can do this.

22:06.376 --> 22:08.542
Jane.

22:08.578 --> 22:12.013
You are definitely a "Scarlet" writer.

22:12.048 --> 22:15.516
I love your determination
and your passion.

22:17.020 --> 22:20.355
I think you should definitely
go after this story.

22:20.390 --> 22:23.824
And I think you should write it
on your own.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.026
What are you saying?

22:25.061 --> 22:26.927
Well, I'm sure you've noticed

22:26.963 --> 22:31.366
Patrick and the dot com are
thriving and that is wonderful,

22:31.401 --> 22:34.735
but it's definitely shifted
the dynamic here at "Scarlet."

22:34.770 --> 22:37.671
Yeah, but you told me
not to worry about that.

22:37.707 --> 22:39.874
Yes.

22:39.909 --> 22:43.211
I may have been off when I said that.

22:50.585 --> 22:52.757
Jane, Jacqueline
is not leaving "Scarlet."

22:52.866 --> 22:54.466
You weren't there. You didn't hear her.

22:54.501 --> 22:56.334
All of a sudden she changed her mind.

22:56.369 --> 22:59.303
And she told me to write the
Pamela Dolan story by myself.

22:59.328 --> 23:01.125
Don't you write all of
your stories by yourself?

23:01.160 --> 23:02.807
This felt different.

23:02.843 --> 23:04.576
If she was leaving,
there would be rumors...

23:04.611 --> 23:05.577
- Yeah.
- Or something.

23:05.612 --> 23:06.854
There were rumors.

23:06.946 --> 23:09.647
Remember the
"Decline of the Celebrity Editor" story?

23:09.682 --> 23:12.216
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm just saying, weird vibes.

23:12.252 --> 23:15.052
Well, vibes are not facts.
They are vibes.

23:15.088 --> 23:17.889
So I say we don't jump
to any conclusions.

23:17.924 --> 23:21.425
I concur with the city
councilwoman to be.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.794
Ah, all right.

23:23.829 --> 23:25.896
I gotta go see a lady about a dress.

23:25.931 --> 23:28.098
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

23:29.234 --> 23:30.867
Thank you.

23:30.903 --> 23:33.378
Hey, Dana, thanks so much
for taking the time to see me.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.414
Of course.

23:34.439 --> 23:36.439
- Is that the dress you're submitting?
- Yes.

23:36.474 --> 23:38.041
Um...

23:46.985 --> 23:48.451
With the waist, you're clearly inspired

23:48.486 --> 23:50.353
by Giambattista Valli.

23:50.388 --> 23:53.924
And the shoulder pads are
a nice nod to Elsa Schiaparelli.

23:53.959 --> 23:57.459
And the rest is muddy.

23:59.596 --> 24:03.498
Uh-huh, okay. Um...

24:05.669 --> 24:07.469
Do you have any suggestions?

24:07.504 --> 24:09.604
Try again.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.641
And maybe don't quit your day job?

24:16.747 --> 24:18.347
Thank you.

24:20.784 --> 24:23.118
It was like I went into
Dana Jacob's office naked,

24:23.154 --> 24:25.721
sang the theme song
to the "Titanic," did the floss,

24:25.756 --> 24:27.923
and then took a giant dump on the floor.

24:27.959 --> 24:29.859
That is oddly specific.

24:29.894 --> 24:33.462
You know, the crazy thing is
that before I started dreaming

24:33.497 --> 24:36.768
about designing, I was really
happy being Oliver's assistant.

24:36.803 --> 24:39.468
So what? Now you're just not
going to apply for that seminar?

24:39.503 --> 24:42.738
Correct. My new plan is day drinking.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.005
How is that different
from any other day?

24:45.509 --> 24:47.509
You were so happy making that dress.

24:47.544 --> 24:49.110
Come on, you can't give up.

24:49.675 --> 24:52.514
Watch me. It's called
adjusting to the new reality.

24:52.549 --> 24:54.449
Now you sound like Jacqueline.

24:54.485 --> 24:56.017
She's not going anywhere.

24:56.052 --> 24:58.286
You didn't hear her.
She sounded resigned.

24:58.321 --> 25:00.689
Want to know what this place
would be like without her?

25:00.724 --> 25:02.790
I just got assigned a story by Patrick

25:02.825 --> 25:05.193
about vaginal rejuvenation.

25:05.228 --> 25:07.295
Because apparently
our vaginas are tired.

25:07.330 --> 25:08.997
Tell me about it.
Richard's got my vagina like:

25:10.063 --> 25:11.199
Oh.

25:11.234 --> 25:12.500
Okay, well, you're disgusting.

25:12.535 --> 25:15.469
- Bye.
- Love you, bye.

25:17.340 --> 25:20.841
- Uh, so Toby's report came in.
- Uh-huh.

25:20.877 --> 25:22.543
Reynolds is going to have a field day.

25:22.578 --> 25:24.478
Hey, we can spin anything.

25:24.514 --> 25:26.147
Reynolds is a douchebag.
I am not worried.

25:26.182 --> 25:28.983
Well. I don't know if it's
a matter of spinning per se.

25:29.019 --> 25:30.518
Mm.

25:30.553 --> 25:34.822
I had an abortion in college,
never told anyone.

25:34.857 --> 25:36.890
Uh, they found it.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.259
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

25:41.196 --> 25:45.465
And look, I'm not usually one
to run away from a fight, but

25:45.500 --> 25:47.267
this just feels like a lot, you know?

25:47.303 --> 25:49.536
I don't know if I'm ready to be
the face of abortion, you know?

25:49.571 --> 25:50.938
- I get that, yes.
- Yeah.

25:50.973 --> 25:52.605
And look, I know I'm letting you down.

25:52.641 --> 25:54.541
No, no, no. You're not.

25:54.576 --> 25:58.145
You're not. I... I um...

25:58.180 --> 26:01.181
I had one, as well.

26:01.216 --> 26:04.884
And I do not think I could
handle it coming out.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.553
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:06.588 --> 26:09.256
I was at Bronx High School of Science.

26:09.291 --> 26:11.024
My parents were super proud of me,

26:11.060 --> 26:13.493
so I couldn't tell them
or anybody really.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.261
So I went to the first
place I could find

26:15.296 --> 26:17.063
which turned out to be a fake clinic.

26:17.098 --> 26:19.098
You know, a crisis pregnancy center

26:19.133 --> 26:21.067
where they give you
an ultrasound and then

26:21.102 --> 26:24.504
flood your brain with
anti-abortion propaganda

26:24.539 --> 26:26.172
and false medical statistics.

26:26.207 --> 26:27.607
I'm... I'm sorry, is that a thing?

26:27.642 --> 26:29.542
Oh, it is very much a thing.

26:29.578 --> 26:31.377
There are actually
a few in your district.

26:31.412 --> 26:34.246
And they're run by anti-choice groups.

26:34.282 --> 26:35.949
And they're designed to scare women away

26:35.984 --> 26:37.383
from getting medical help.

26:37.418 --> 26:41.454
- Crazy.
- It is crazy.

26:41.490 --> 26:43.189
Anyway, I finally found a real place,

26:43.224 --> 26:45.525
but by then of course I was terrified

26:45.560 --> 26:49.261
and guilt ridden and...

26:49.297 --> 26:50.563
Wow.

26:50.599 --> 26:53.099
- That's some dark stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

26:53.134 --> 26:55.067
Anyway, enough about me.

26:56.237 --> 26:58.770
What are you, uh,

26:58.806 --> 26:59.815
what you thinking?

27:00.040 --> 27:01.058
Uh.

27:01.942 --> 27:03.675
No idea.

27:03.711 --> 27:05.211
I feel like I need to sleep on it.

27:05.246 --> 27:08.680
I mean, I still haven't
figured out my platform.

27:08.716 --> 27:11.317
Well.

27:11.352 --> 27:13.919
You know how bad I want you to run.

27:13.954 --> 27:16.555
And I am by your side
if they come for you.

27:16.590 --> 27:21.227
But you gotta do what's best for you.

27:24.332 --> 27:25.664
Hey, where's my recommendation form?

27:25.699 --> 27:27.599
Isn't it due soon?

27:27.635 --> 27:31.437
Yeah, um, Oliver, I'm not going
to submit my application.

27:31.472 --> 27:34.039
Because I don't want you
to write a recommendation

27:34.074 --> 27:37.342
that you don't believe in.

27:37.377 --> 27:41.112
Okay, I believe in Sutton Brady.

27:41.148 --> 27:44.182
And I gave you my honest
opinion not because I think

27:44.217 --> 27:48.153
you don't have talent but
because I know you do.

27:48.188 --> 27:51.523
I'm not getting in
with that dress, am I?

27:51.558 --> 27:55.260
No.

27:55.295 --> 27:58.963
Do you want me to be honest
or do you want me to be nice?

27:58.998 --> 28:00.498
Honest?

28:00.534 --> 28:03.301
Take a beat. Rethink it.

28:03.336 --> 28:04.635
Because I know that
you're going to be able

28:04.671 --> 28:08.273
to come up with something great.

28:08.308 --> 28:11.042
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:11.078 --> 28:14.212
And, Red, if you want
to make it as a designer,

28:14.247 --> 28:17.315
you're going to have
to be able to take a note,

28:17.350 --> 28:19.217
roll with the punches,
and bounce back with

28:19.252 --> 28:22.053
the confidence of a mediocre white man.

28:23.590 --> 28:25.189
I could channel my inner Kevin Costner.

28:25.224 --> 28:26.523
Exactly.

28:26.559 --> 28:27.992
Now can you also get me that form?

28:28.027 --> 28:31.729
Okay, I will.

28:31.764 --> 28:33.163
- Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

28:33.199 --> 28:34.264
- Right now.
- Mm-hmm.

28:37.236 --> 28:41.706
Great. Now start designing.

29:08.495 --> 29:09.946
Hey, Jane, hurry up.

29:09.980 --> 29:11.912
Jacqueline's party starts in an hour.

29:11.948 --> 29:14.227
What happened? I moved out
and you don't have any mixers?

29:14.481 --> 29:17.613
Yeah, I do. Use the cran-tabulous stuff.

29:17.653 --> 29:20.921
That is not a mixer.
That is UTI medication.

29:20.957 --> 29:22.923
I have a thirst, not a burn.

29:22.959 --> 29:25.359
Yeah, but you know, cranberry juice

29:25.395 --> 29:27.295
actually doesn't cure UTIs.

29:27.330 --> 29:30.264
- What?
- Mm-hmm. Just proved.

29:30.300 --> 29:31.811
Well, hello mixer.

29:32.602 --> 29:36.170
And thank you for the
public health announcement.

29:36.206 --> 29:39.372
Is that because you're about
to be public servant Kat Edison?

29:39.408 --> 29:41.541
Oh, we'll see. Maybe.

29:41.577 --> 29:43.110
I don't know.

29:43.145 --> 29:45.579
Oh, hey, wait.
Is that a slit in that dress?

29:45.615 --> 29:49.984
You know, it's so funny that
you ask because yes, it is.

29:50.019 --> 29:51.952
- Whoa. Hello, Angelina.
- Yeah.

29:51.988 --> 29:53.954
Guys, I'm still trying not
to freak out about the fact

29:53.990 --> 29:55.656
that it might be Jacqueline's
retirement party.

29:55.691 --> 29:57.992
Oh, Jane, dramatic much?

29:58.027 --> 29:59.526
You didn't see her last night.

29:59.561 --> 30:01.061
- I did.
- Yeah, I guess.

30:01.097 --> 30:02.930
Isn't there anything she can do?

30:02.965 --> 30:06.566
No, I'm pretty sure
she's resigned to her fate.

30:06.602 --> 30:09.569
Well, is there anything
we can do to help?

30:10.038 --> 30:11.471
I don't know.

30:11.507 --> 30:14.907
But I'm going to try.

30:14.943 --> 30:17.677
Gonna need some help first.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.647
Oh, yeah, love that.

30:20.682 --> 30:22.882
Hey, any chance you can go
put your dress on now?

30:22.917 --> 30:24.817
Yeah.

There she is.

Who would want her to leave "Scarlet"?

30:57.719 --> 31:00.920
Not me, and I'm pretty sure not her.

31:00.955 --> 31:03.122

Since before the Jacqueline decade.

31:26.095 --> 31:27.546
That's true.

31:27.582 --> 31:29.481
Anyway, I'm so glad
you could be here tonight.

31:29.517 --> 31:31.650
Yes, good to see you.

31:31.686 --> 31:33.552
Jane. You remember Ian?

31:33.588 --> 31:35.221
- Yes.
- Of course. Jane, how are you?

31:35.256 --> 31:36.355
- Nice to see you.
- Very nice to see you again.

31:36.390 --> 31:38.090
And I think it's probably time

31:38.125 --> 31:40.058
for me to replenish those glasses.

31:40.094 --> 31:42.961
- Good bye.
- Thank you.

31:42.996 --> 31:45.364
- Great turn out.
- Yeah.

31:45.399 --> 31:48.534
Yeah, you really get to know
a lot of people in ten years.

31:48.569 --> 31:50.202
And write a lot of great stories.

31:50.237 --> 31:51.836
Oh, thanks.

31:51.871 --> 31:54.171
I was actually rereading
the Gotham Girls piece for,

31:54.207 --> 31:55.673
like, the tenth time.

31:55.709 --> 31:57.508
What is it with you and roller derby?

31:57.544 --> 32:01.045
Well, I just...
I really love Sandra DiMesa's story,

32:01.080 --> 32:04.716
how she broke her neck
when she was 41 and then

32:04.751 --> 32:07.785
three months later,
she skated in the championship.

32:07.820 --> 32:09.754
She is a force of nature.

32:09.789 --> 32:12.022
- And she's still skating.
- Hm.

32:12.058 --> 32:14.325
I found her on Facebook
and I reached out.

32:14.361 --> 32:15.926
She says congrats by the way.

32:15.962 --> 32:19.564
Oh, well that's nice of her.

32:19.599 --> 32:23.368
Uh, I actually asked her
why she still does it,

32:23.403 --> 32:27.238
why she puts herself through
the work day after day.

32:27.274 --> 32:30.440
She says it's because she loves it,

32:30.476 --> 32:33.343
and because she's good at it,

32:33.379 --> 32:36.079
and she doesn't care
if people think that

32:36.114 --> 32:38.749
it's time for her to hang up her skates.

32:38.784 --> 32:42.753
But most importantly it's
because her fearlessness

32:42.788 --> 32:45.822
and her heart make every
woman on that team better.

32:47.859 --> 32:52.262
Anyways, um, it's a great party.

32:52.298 --> 32:53.830
Have a good time.

32:53.865 --> 32:55.131
You too.

33:06.644 --> 33:08.278
Hi.

33:08.313 --> 33:10.847
Hey, uh, Carly wants
to skip school tomorrow,

33:10.882 --> 33:12.949
so I need to call the sitter,
see if she can work.

33:12.984 --> 33:14.851
Make sure I don't miss
Jacqueline's speech.

33:14.886 --> 33:17.653
Oliver, you can't keep
doing this with Carly.

33:17.689 --> 33:19.722
You can't keep making excuses for her

33:19.757 --> 33:20.790
and letting her skip school.

33:20.826 --> 33:22.258
- You don't understand.
- As the child

33:22.294 --> 33:24.327
of an alcoholic, I think I do.

33:24.362 --> 33:25.795
You gave me some tough love,

33:25.831 --> 33:27.730
and now I'm gonna give you some.

33:27.765 --> 33:31.634
Kids need rules,
boundaries, consistency.

33:31.669 --> 33:34.304
So tell her she's going
to school and make her go,

33:34.339 --> 33:36.672
and they day after that,
and the day after that.

33:36.708 --> 33:38.741
And the day after that is a weekend

33:38.776 --> 33:42.845
so probably not that day,
but you know what I mean.

33:42.880 --> 33:46.281
She'll be mad at you for a while,

33:46.317 --> 33:49.218
but then she'll be really,
really grateful

33:49.253 --> 33:52.955
that you did what was right
and not just what was easy.

33:55.827 --> 33:58.093
Damn, Red.

33:58.128 --> 34:01.797
Has the student become the teacher?

34:01.833 --> 34:06.668
Don't get too ahead of yourself,
Miss Brady.

34:06.703 --> 34:10.105
And now, a woman
whose tenure speaks for itself.

34:10.139 --> 34:11.672
Jacqueline Carlyle.

34:18.349 --> 34:19.813
Did you talk to her?

34:19.850 --> 34:22.985
Yeah, but I'm not sure it helped.

34:31.916 --> 34:37.251
When RJ asked me
to run "Scarlet" ten years ago,

34:37.286 --> 34:40.722
I was terrified, but I said yes,

34:40.757 --> 34:43.024
because I had promised
myself that I would

34:43.059 --> 34:47.629
always run towards
what frightens me most.

34:47.664 --> 34:49.531
Which is why I love roller coasters.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.299
Well,

34:52.335 --> 34:55.302
this past decade has certainly given me

34:55.338 --> 35:00.741
the thrill of a rollercoaster ride.

35:00.776 --> 35:04.412
But these past few months
could better be described

35:04.447 --> 35:08.715
as a gravity drop.

35:08.751 --> 35:11.752
Enough so that...

35:19.662 --> 35:23.830
The media landscape
is changing so rapidly

35:23.866 --> 35:26.399
that it can be hard to keep up,

35:26.435 --> 35:29.970
let alone stay ahead of the curve.

35:30.005 --> 35:32.505
And I will be really honest with you,

35:32.541 --> 35:35.375
I am still terrified.

35:35.410 --> 35:39.179
I'm scared that if I do stick around,

35:39.214 --> 35:44.384
I will fail.

35:44.419 --> 35:47.420
I'll let our readers down.

35:47.456 --> 35:52.659
I'm scared that I'll
let all of you down.

35:52.695 --> 35:57.464
But earlier tonight,
I was reminded how...

35:57.499 --> 35:59.799
how contagious fearlessness can be.

36:01.103 --> 36:05.405
And I realized that I have to

36:05.440 --> 36:08.341
keep that promise I made
to myself over ten years ago,

36:08.376 --> 36:12.378
and I have to run towards
what terrifies me so much.

36:12.414 --> 36:17.016
So, I need to stay.

36:17.051 --> 36:20.086
And not just because I love what I do

36:20.122 --> 36:23.055
but because that is
the essence of "Scarlet,"

36:23.091 --> 36:25.925
to inspire young women

36:25.960 --> 36:29.929
to face challenges head on,

36:29.964 --> 36:32.465
to take a leap of faith.

36:32.501 --> 36:36.135
And yes, it is frightening.

36:36.170 --> 36:38.904
But that's the beauty of it, isn't it?

36:38.940 --> 36:45.277
Because without that leap,
we'll never know what could be,

36:45.312 --> 36:47.747
we'll never know

36:47.782 --> 36:50.816
what we are capable of.

36:53.021 --> 36:57.156
And I, for one, can't wait to find out.

36:59.426 --> 37:00.960
Thank you.

37:15.108 --> 37:17.609
Thanks.

37:17.645 --> 37:20.879
Well, that was an amazing speech.

37:20.914 --> 37:22.747
I thought you'd like it.

37:22.783 --> 37:26.218
So these Pamela Dolan rumors.

37:26.253 --> 37:29.288
That would be a big story for "Scarlet."

37:29.323 --> 37:32.157
So I can write it for you?

37:32.193 --> 37:34.159
Oh, you're not writing it for me.

37:34.195 --> 37:35.760
You're writing it with me.

37:35.796 --> 37:37.529
- But Patrick...
- It's "Scarlet."

37:37.565 --> 37:39.030
It's still my magazine.

37:40.849 --> 37:42.766
Yeah.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.769
Jane.

37:45.805 --> 37:46.904
Thank you.

37:53.379 --> 37:56.312
_

38:21.207 --> 38:23.273
_

38:48.934 --> 38:51.034
- Hey.
- Hey, so I've been thinking.

38:51.070 --> 38:54.070
And I know the dress is a lot,
but just ignore it for now.

38:54.105 --> 38:55.838
- Okay.
- Uh.

38:55.874 --> 38:59.442
At first when I got
Toby's report, it felt like...

38:59.478 --> 39:02.279
it felt like a list of all the
reasons why I shouldn't run.

39:02.314 --> 39:07.284
I was scared and I was
ashamed but you know what?

39:07.319 --> 39:08.951
I think that that's the problem.

39:08.987 --> 39:11.321
I think that the list
of strikes against me

39:11.356 --> 39:12.722
should be my platform.

39:12.758 --> 39:15.458
- I like the sound of that.
- Right.

39:15.494 --> 39:18.595
Like, okay, yes, I was arrested

39:18.630 --> 39:20.630
but I was standing up for
something that I believe in

39:20.666 --> 39:23.732
and honestly I'd do it again.

39:23.768 --> 39:28.003
And I like to think of myself
as a pretty, strong, empowered,

39:28.038 --> 39:33.241
forward-thinking, open-minded woman, but

39:33.277 --> 39:36.312
up until now I haven't been able
to talk about my abortion.

39:36.347 --> 39:40.416
So if me putting myself out there
helps even one woman

39:40.451 --> 39:46.087
to feel less alone,
less ashamed, and less guilty,

39:46.123 --> 39:48.424
then it's worth it.

39:48.459 --> 39:51.460
And I want to shut down
those fake clinics.

39:53.964 --> 39:56.298
Do you...

39:56.334 --> 39:58.266
Do you have any idea
what's happening right now?

39:58.302 --> 39:59.835
I don't.

39:59.870 --> 40:02.337
A dance of joy is happening right now

40:02.372 --> 40:05.640
because I am so about
everything you're saying.

40:05.675 --> 40:08.108
I'm 100% in. We're going to win.

40:08.144 --> 40:10.345
And I just need
you to join me, yes Kat...

40:10.380 --> 40:12.279
- You got it.
- No, no, but I need... can you...

40:12.315 --> 40:13.581
Look, you're gonna have to be a fool

40:13.616 --> 40:15.015
when we're campaigning, that's right.

40:15.051 --> 40:16.718
Let it go, let it go,
'cause we're gonna win.

40:16.753 --> 40:18.152
Hi, excuse me.

40:18.187 --> 40:20.787
Is this Linda Zephyr's headquarters?

40:20.823 --> 40:22.288
Yes.

40:22.324 --> 40:25.191
But she's not running, actually.

40:25.227 --> 40:26.360
Oh.

40:26.395 --> 40:29.596
Uh, I am running.

40:29.631 --> 40:33.500
And I don't usually dress like this but,

40:33.535 --> 40:34.701
hi, I'm Kat Edison.

40:34.737 --> 40:36.470
Nice to meet you.

40:36.505 --> 40:41.508
And just so you know, um,
I smoke weed sometimes,

40:41.543 --> 40:45.679
I support immigrants rights,
and I had an abortion.

40:45.714 --> 40:47.748
Well, my kind of candidate.

40:47.783 --> 40:51.517
Please let me tell you more
about this amazing woman.

40:51.552 --> 40:53.218
Um, we're just getting
our platform together now

40:53.254 --> 40:55.554
but I have so much faith in her.
