getting all my stuff ready.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.070
Anticipating
the call of the wild, man.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.240
Whoo!

13:32.240 --> 13:34.970
I think I got it
all set.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.980
I'm all outfitted
in the latest

13:36.980 --> 13:39.050
featherweight,
all-terrain gear.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.510
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

13:40.520 --> 13:41.650
You sure you got
everything?

13:41.650 --> 13:42.880
Oh, I got everything.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.850
I got foam pads,

13:44.850 --> 13:47.050
bat bags,
propane stove,

13:47.050 --> 13:48.320
insect repellent.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.090
I bet you even got
a snakebite kit in there.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.660
Snakebite kit,

13:51.660 --> 13:53.490
and a hand-held
water purifier.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.160
I thought all you drank

13:55.160 --> 13:57.330
was those little
green bottles from France.

13:57.330 --> 13:59.430
Well, a man's going
to be roughing it,

13:59.430 --> 14:01.200
he has to make compromises.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.770
Look, Trivette,

14:02.770 --> 14:05.340
every year I go
to the badlands

14:05.340 --> 14:06.840
for a whole week.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.710
I take no food,
no water.

14:08.710 --> 14:11.310
Now, if you want to learn
how to survive,

14:11.310 --> 14:14.010
this is all you get.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.990
This is it?

14:22.990 --> 14:24.860
Yeah, we travel light.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.530
Eat whatever we can find.

14:26.530 --> 14:27.690
"Eat what we can find"?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.400
We'll be be out
in the middle of nowhere.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.270
Yeah, but there's beetles,
there's grubs,

14:32.270 --> 14:33.770
there's even snake meat.

14:33.770 --> 14:35.870
I'm a semi-vegetarian,
Walker.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.700
Well, then you got shrubs
and roots.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.010
Shrubs and roots?

14:39.010 --> 14:40.470
Actually,
it's pretty good eating,

14:40.480 --> 14:43.110
once you get past the grit
and the maggot larva.

14:43.110 --> 14:44.640
What?

14:45.850 --> 14:47.510
( cell phone ringing )
That's sickening.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.650
What's in that bag?

14:49.650 --> 14:52.150
That's my telephone.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.630
Yeah, Trivette.

14:59.630 --> 15:00.960
<i> Trivette. Alex.</i>

15:00.960 --> 15:02.830
Listen, I know how much
you were looking forward

15:02.830 --> 15:04.200
to going out with Walker,

15:04.200 --> 15:06.730
but Dallas P.D. just picked up
Brady Riggs.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.730
Really?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.070
<i> Yes.</i>

15:09.070 --> 15:11.570
We need you to ID him
at the suppression hearing.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.910
Gee, Alex,
that's a shame.

15:15.310 --> 15:16.680
Brady Riggs.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.040
Duty calls.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.150
Guess I'm gonna have
to stay back this time.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.820
Hey, you sure
you can go alone?

15:22.820 --> 15:25.880
Oh, I'm sure
I can manage it.

15:25.890 --> 15:28.550
(<i> country guitar theme playing</i> )

15:33.190 --> 15:35.130
Hey, Alex, all this talk about
the great wide open

15:35.130 --> 15:36.300
has made really me hungry.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.300
How about I buy you
breakfast this morning?

15:38.300 --> 15:39.800
Well, you know,

15:39.800 --> 15:41.870
like Jarlsberg
and scallion omelet

15:41.870 --> 15:43.740
with some brioche.

15:43.740 --> 15:45.140
Maybe a...

15:45.140 --> 15:48.110
decaf cappuccino.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.980
( dog barking )

15:56.750 --> 15:58.320
I'm looking for Duwayne,
Mrs. Parsons.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.320
He wasn't in school today.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.550
Oh, yeah?

16:00.560 --> 16:01.850
When you find him,
tell him

16:01.860 --> 16:03.920
it's the last time
he gets his hands on my van.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.760
I had to hitch a ride
home last night.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.380
( tires screeching )

16:27.180 --> 16:28.680
Hey.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.760
Hey, man, you guys
better back off.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.530
My dad lives a few trailers up
and he's gonna--

16:41.530 --> 16:43.760
Sleep it off.
Yeah, we already checked.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.300
Look, what do you guys
want from me?

16:45.300 --> 16:46.630
We want what's ours,
kid.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.000
You were there last night,
Lone Star Packing.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.900
With your friend's van
that drove away.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.770
Now, we want
our merchandise.

16:52.770 --> 16:54.310
Well, I don't know
where it's at.

16:54.310 --> 16:58.080
You guys in Texas think
you're really tough, don't you?

17:00.320 --> 17:03.020
I liberated it
from a cop in Brooklyn.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.980
Duwayne Parsons,
he took it.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.420
Is that where he lives,
over there?

17:07.420 --> 17:09.460
Okay, look,
he has a secret place.

17:09.460 --> 17:12.119
It's this old
abandoned stable.

17:12.130 --> 17:14.359
He-- He goes there
when he cuts school.

17:14.359 --> 17:16.530
Good.
We go down there,

17:16.530 --> 17:18.560
we find him,

17:18.569 --> 17:20.069
we get back
our merchandise.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.240
And you get a reward.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.970
What's the reward?

17:24.970 --> 17:26.640
The reward is...

17:26.640 --> 17:28.410
we let you live.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.780
( both laugh )

17:30.780 --> 17:33.050
(<i> guitar theme playing</i> )

18:59.030 --> 19:00.730
( man speaks
indistinctly )

19:03.700 --> 19:05.440
Hey,
how you doin'?

19:10.650 --> 19:14.050
Cordell Walker. I ain't seen you
in a month of Sundays.

19:14.050 --> 19:15.080
It has been a while,
Eldon.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.380
If I had known
you were coming,

19:16.380 --> 19:17.520
I'd have held your booth,

19:17.520 --> 19:19.290
but the youngster
beat you to it.

19:19.290 --> 19:20.850
Wanted a view
of the road.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.690
WALKER: That's okay.
ELDON: But now, then,

19:22.690 --> 19:24.920
what would you like to have,
Cordell? Wait a minute,

19:24.930 --> 19:27.430
don't tell me.
Chicken-fried steak.

19:27.430 --> 19:28.790
You got it, Eldon.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.930
I'll get it.

19:32.830 --> 19:35.430
All the kid had stashed in there
was in this.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.170
ANTHONY:
What's that? That?

19:39.170 --> 19:40.470
BOY:
It's a motorcycle buckle.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.340
His dad gave it to him
for winning the motocross.

19:42.340 --> 19:43.580
Dad?

19:43.580 --> 19:46.910
Yeah. He has a picture
of him with his motorcycle.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.750
Where does he live?
Where?

19:48.750 --> 19:50.650
Out in the flats,
by Jacksboro.

19:50.650 --> 19:52.250
We know where
you live, punk.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.520
We don't recover our goods,
we're coming back for you.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.390
There, kid, beat it.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.600
Okay, that's gonna be
16.20.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.900
Uh, plus
the cigarettes.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.600
Let's just make it
an even 18.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.870
Do you take credit cards?

20:11.870 --> 20:13.610
Where do you think you are,

20:13.610 --> 20:15.780
The International
House of Pancakes?

20:15.780 --> 20:17.010
( sighs )

20:17.010 --> 20:18.680
All right, can you, uh...

20:18.680 --> 20:20.710
give me another coffee
and cherry pie?

20:20.710 --> 20:21.880
Where's the bathroom?

20:21.880 --> 20:22.920
It's down there.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.980
All right. Thanks.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.820
We'll square up
in a sec.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.760
Hey, kid.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.630
That your van
down the road?

20:34.630 --> 20:36.030
Yeah.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.700
You need help
changing the tire?

20:37.700 --> 20:39.230
Well, the pistons are shot,

20:39.230 --> 20:41.630
brakes are gone,
it's finished.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.700
I'll be glad to take a look
at it.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.740
No. I don't have the time,
all right?

20:46.740 --> 20:48.610
I'm busy.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.280
Kids today.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.620
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

21:16.840 --> 21:18.600
Well,

21:18.610 --> 21:20.770
that's the best dang meal
I had in a long time, Eldon.

21:20.770 --> 21:21.870
Thanks.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.880
Yep, still the best cook
in the county.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.580
Aw.

21:25.580 --> 21:28.010
Hold on to this,
and I'll see you in a week.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.180
Okay.

21:29.180 --> 21:31.150
Sure you don't want company,
Cordell?

21:31.150 --> 21:33.250
Must get lonely out there
in them badlands.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.150
WALKER:
Well...

21:35.160 --> 21:37.820
that's the idea, Lurleen.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.490
If I was gonna share
those stars with anyone,

21:40.490 --> 21:42.860
it would be you.

21:42.860 --> 21:44.500
( chuckles )

21:45.970 --> 21:48.100
( door opening )

21:48.100 --> 21:50.600
WALKER:
I guess you're right,
Eldon. Kids today.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.610
Hell, if I'd had known
the kid was broke,

21:52.610 --> 21:53.970
I'd have fed him
for free.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.940
Here, let me pay his tab.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.310
Oh, thanks.

21:58.310 --> 22:00.080
See you in a week.
Okay.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.210
You be careful, now,
okay?

22:02.220 --> 22:03.980
( crickets chirping )

22:12.060 --> 22:13.560
( sighs )

22:13.560 --> 22:15.790
( wolves howling )

22:17.330 --> 22:19.200
I know how you feel.

22:24.870 --> 22:26.370
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

22:26.370 --> 22:29.110
If this fire catches,
it'll burn wild for 50 miles!

22:40.760 --> 22:42.660
You owe me 20 bucks.

22:42.660 --> 22:43.990
What for?

22:43.990 --> 22:45.890
I paid for your meal
at the diner.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.860
Right, yeah.

22:48.860 --> 22:51.800
Let's see if I can't
take care of you, huh.

22:53.070 --> 22:54.570
There you go.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.140
How old are you, kid?

22:57.140 --> 22:59.240
I'm old enough.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.280
I don't think so.

23:03.280 --> 23:05.610
Now, let's start this
over again.

23:05.610 --> 23:06.780
Who you running from?

23:06.780 --> 23:08.580
Who says I'm runnin'?

23:08.580 --> 23:10.520
By the look on your face
in the diner,

23:10.520 --> 23:12.620
and the van you left
on the side of the road.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.850
Yeah, well, that's, um--

23:14.860 --> 23:17.090
You see, this--
This biker gang...

23:18.290 --> 23:19.530
they trashed my van,

23:19.530 --> 23:22.630
and uh, stole all my money,
left me for dead,

23:22.630 --> 23:24.000
so I crawled over
to that cafe

23:24.000 --> 23:25.230
and now I'm out here,

23:25.230 --> 23:26.600
and I'm gonna
settle the score.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.230
Hmm.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.270
Really?
Yeah.

23:31.670 --> 23:33.570
Hey, man, that's mine.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.180
Where'd this come from?

23:43.550 --> 23:45.580
I found that dope
out in the badlands,

23:45.590 --> 23:47.050
and that is my dope.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.920
Sure, you did.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.190
Let's go.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.530
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

24:04.770 --> 24:06.740
We got that
little sucker now.

24:06.740 --> 24:07.940
Heh-heh-heh.

24:10.410 --> 24:12.580
Do you know what the penalty is
for possession?

24:12.580 --> 24:14.210
What do I care?

24:14.220 --> 24:15.810
I'm a juvie.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.550
With this amount
of drugs, kid,

24:17.550 --> 24:19.380
you're gonna be tried
as an adult.

24:20.620 --> 24:23.020
What business is this
of yours, anyway?

24:24.860 --> 24:26.690
You'll find out
soon enough.

24:26.690 --> 24:29.160
Now, how about tellin' me
the truth for a change?

24:29.160 --> 24:30.760
All right.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.230
All right, you want the truth?

24:32.230 --> 24:33.630
The truth is--
Is I thought

24:33.630 --> 24:36.430
I was boostin' some steaks
from a packin' house,

24:36.440 --> 24:38.000
and the stuff
was inside the packages.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.540
And then these guys
with gland problems

24:39.540 --> 24:41.370
start shootin' at me.
What guys?

24:41.380 --> 24:43.180
Looked like
out-of-state hoods.

24:43.180 --> 24:45.310
Did you hear a name
or anything?

24:45.310 --> 24:47.380
One guy called him, uh,
"Mr. Mancini."

24:47.380 --> 24:49.180
Mancini.

24:50.450 --> 24:51.720
If you looked
at mug shots,

24:51.720 --> 24:53.690
do you think you could
recognize any of these guys?

24:53.690 --> 24:55.320
No. I-I--

24:55.320 --> 24:57.420
I don't stick my neck out
for nobody.

24:57.420 --> 24:58.460
You got that?

24:58.460 --> 25:00.390
Sure, tough guy,
I've got that.

25:00.390 --> 25:02.930
But if you stole from who
I think you stole from,

25:02.930 --> 25:04.960
you're gonna need a friend
real bad.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.040
Here you go.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.010
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

25:16.580 --> 25:17.680
( screams )

25:27.850 --> 25:29.520
So, what are you gonna
say to Eldon?

25:29.520 --> 25:30.690
I'm gonna tell him
to kiss my--

25:30.690 --> 25:31.990
Eh!

25:31.990 --> 25:33.990
That I'll wash
every freakin' glass

25:33.990 --> 25:35.860
in his place
to pay off the meal.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.700
That's what I like.
A boy who's truly repentant.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.530
Wait a minute.
I got to make a call.

25:53.310 --> 25:54.750
( phone rings )

25:56.220 --> 25:57.380
Trivette.

25:57.390 --> 26:00.250
Trivette, how'd the hearing go
with Riggs?

26:00.250 --> 26:02.490
Piece of cake.
The judge denied the bail.

26:02.490 --> 26:04.320
Hey, what are you doing
on a phone?

26:04.330 --> 26:06.790
Well, I got a little delayed.

26:06.790 --> 26:08.990
Have you ever heard
of a guy named Mancini,

26:09.000 --> 26:12.060
possibly out-of-state,
maybe Mafia?

26:12.070 --> 26:14.300
Mafia, huh?

26:14.300 --> 26:16.400
Okay, there's a crime boss
out of New York

26:16.400 --> 26:17.940
<i> named Paul Mancini.</i>

26:17.940 --> 26:19.710
<i> And DEA intel says</i>
<i> he might be out here</i>

26:19.710 --> 26:21.010
trying to push
some smack.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.170
Why?

26:22.180 --> 26:24.480
What's it gonna be, old man?

26:24.480 --> 26:26.380
Your waitress here,

26:26.380 --> 26:27.710
or that kid?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.650
Look, all I know
is the kid come in

26:29.650 --> 26:31.680
and sat in that booth.

26:31.690 --> 26:33.220
He kept checking
the window,

26:33.220 --> 26:35.290
and then finally got up
and took off without payin'.

26:35.290 --> 26:36.560
Which way?

26:36.560 --> 26:38.190
LURLEEN:
Y'all just leave him alone.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.960
I served the kid,
he went north.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.060
ANTHONY:
What's out there?

26:41.060 --> 26:42.560
Just a lot of mesquite.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.760
What else?

26:43.760 --> 26:45.760
He's supposed to be
some kind of biker.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.830
He's got some kind of dirt bike.
You know him?

26:48.840 --> 26:50.970
No, I know somebody.
I don't know, it could be him.

26:50.970 --> 26:52.710
Which way does he live?

26:52.710 --> 26:55.010
Listen, man,
I'm getting hungry.

26:55.010 --> 26:56.810
Walker, who was that?

26:56.810 --> 26:58.640
Oh, just a stray I found.

26:58.650 --> 27:00.110
Go on inside,
I'll meet you there.

27:00.110 --> 27:02.480
Ah-ah! Leave that here.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.290
Look, Trivette,
run a make on this Mancini.

27:09.290 --> 27:10.720
Listen, all I know
is there's a guy

27:10.720 --> 27:14.260
that lives about 15 miles out.
Yeah, he lives in a bus.

27:14.260 --> 27:17.530
It's off of a dirt path.
It's just north of here.

27:17.530 --> 27:19.870
Is there an address?
No, there's no address.

27:19.870 --> 27:21.900
It's-- It's at the end
of a cow path.

27:21.900 --> 27:24.440
There's a couple of--
Of Tecate cans on a pole

27:24.440 --> 27:25.540
that marks the path.

27:31.810 --> 27:33.010
Don't try it!

27:33.880 --> 27:35.180
( woman screams )

27:37.550 --> 27:39.550
Walker, what's going on?
I just heard some shots.

27:39.550 --> 27:40.650
( women screaming )

28:05.180 --> 28:06.310
Where'd he go?

28:06.310 --> 28:08.110
There!

28:08.880 --> 28:10.120
Hyah!

28:24.600 --> 28:25.800
How bad is it,
Eldon?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.430
I'll live.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.570
LURLEEN:
Three of 'em
went after the kid.

28:30.540 --> 28:31.740
Which way did they go?

28:31.740 --> 28:32.840
ELDON:
Due north.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.510
There's a biker
lives out that way.

28:35.510 --> 28:36.740
The kid had
a picture of him.

28:36.740 --> 28:38.940
Those morons seemed
mighty interested too.

28:38.950 --> 28:40.450
Okay, call the sheriff.

28:40.450 --> 28:42.710
Keep an eye on this guy
until he gets here.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.680
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

29:15.620 --> 29:17.450
Two million miles away
from nowhere,

29:17.450 --> 29:19.080
we lose the man's dope!

29:19.090 --> 29:20.220
We don't know where this kid is

29:20.220 --> 29:22.320
or his damn old man
on the bike!

29:23.460 --> 29:26.060
Hey, look at these tracks.

29:26.060 --> 29:28.190
They got to be his, no?

29:28.200 --> 29:30.100
Let's go.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.690
( snake rattling )

30:02.460 --> 30:03.860
Ugh!

30:20.950 --> 30:22.380
You hungry?

30:24.920 --> 30:26.680
( people speaking indistinctly )

30:32.390 --> 30:34.030
( tires screeching )

30:46.210 --> 30:48.870
I'm Ranger Trivette,
this is Captain Parker.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.240
Looking for Cordell Walker,
he called from here.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.580
Well, he'd be somewhere between
here and Lubbock by now.

30:54.580 --> 30:56.580
About 100 miles
of badlands,

30:56.580 --> 30:59.350
and he's got three Italian
button men on his trail.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.760
Kid's headed straight
for his old man's place.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.300
Hey, wait a minute.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.900
There's another set of tracks.

31:13.900 --> 31:16.400
Looks like cowboy boots.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.870
Looks like size 11,
don't you think?

31:18.870 --> 31:20.970
Which means
somebody's with him.

31:20.970 --> 31:23.070
It's time to call
Mancini.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.480
We need the bird.

31:34.290 --> 31:36.690
Here you go.

31:36.690 --> 31:39.120
You think I'm gonna
put that snake in my mouth?

31:39.130 --> 31:40.590
Tastes just like chicken.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.160
It's either that
or the grubs.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.630
What are the grubs?

31:49.600 --> 31:50.600
( sighs )

31:50.600 --> 31:51.840
I'll take the snake.

31:51.840 --> 31:54.710
I figured you would.

31:54.710 --> 31:55.810
This is--

31:55.810 --> 31:57.710
This is just like chicken.

31:57.710 --> 32:00.510
Let me ask you something.

32:00.510 --> 32:02.780
Why are you doing
all this stuff for me?

32:02.780 --> 32:05.620
Well, maybe
it's the right thing to do.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.090
You tell me something,
Duwayne.

32:11.090 --> 32:12.560
What are you doing
all the way out here

32:12.560 --> 32:13.660
in the middle
of nowhere

32:13.660 --> 32:15.360
with 3 keys
of smack?

32:15.360 --> 32:16.960
My old man
lives out here.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.260
Your father?
Yeah.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.870
Yeah,
he's a pretty cool guy.

32:19.870 --> 32:21.870
He's been in some trouble
with the law.

32:21.870 --> 32:22.900
( chuckles )

32:23.800 --> 32:25.170
What about
your mother?

32:25.170 --> 32:27.070
She OD'd
when I was 9.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.410
I've been living
with my stepmom

32:28.410 --> 32:30.240
off and on
for about three years.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.340
So you've come all the way
out here to see your father?

32:32.350 --> 32:34.480
To drop that dope off
at his feet,

32:34.480 --> 32:36.510
tell him I stood up
to the Mafia.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.620
He said we're gonna
together someday.

32:38.620 --> 32:39.880
He promised me.

32:39.890 --> 32:41.520
Soon as he got
his life together.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.920
So you think
you're going to impress

32:42.920 --> 32:45.160
your father by dropping
this dope at his feet.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.360
Well, I'm going to prove to him,
once and for all,

32:47.360 --> 32:49.860
that his son is--
Is no punk.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.660
That I deserve
his love.

32:57.170 --> 32:58.800
How far away
is this place?

32:58.810 --> 33:00.870
Maybe a mile.

33:00.870 --> 33:02.840
Think you can make it
on that ankle?

33:02.840 --> 33:05.010
Yeah. Yeah,
I think so.

33:10.580 --> 33:12.280
What are you doing?

33:12.290 --> 33:14.120
Well, if you're going
to impress your father,

33:14.120 --> 33:16.720
you're gonna have to do
without the drugs.

33:17.890 --> 33:19.190
Let's go.

33:23.560 --> 33:26.400
You haven't said much
about your stepmom.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.500
Well, we don't exactly
see eye to eye.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.100
Why is that?

33:31.110 --> 33:33.140
She's always
on my case

33:33.140 --> 33:36.840
about school
or my dad.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.950
She doesn't want you
to see your dad?

33:39.950 --> 33:43.410
Yeah, something
like that.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.920
You said
she's a waitress.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.590
Yeah,
she's got two jobs.

33:48.590 --> 33:50.990
One during the day,
one at night.

33:50.990 --> 33:53.420
She's got no time
for me.

33:54.490 --> 33:57.030
Well, since she holds down
two jobs,

33:57.030 --> 33:59.560
seems like you'd
give her a little slack.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.300
Well, I suppose
she means well enough,

34:01.300 --> 34:04.240
it's just, we don't--
We don't--

34:04.240 --> 34:07.610
We're from two
different planets, you know?

34:07.610 --> 34:09.710
My dad and I...

34:09.710 --> 34:11.639
We connect.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.550
Well, you know,

34:16.550 --> 34:17.820
sometimes things
don't turn out

34:17.820 --> 34:19.250
the way we want.

34:19.250 --> 34:21.920
And when
that happens,

34:21.920 --> 34:25.120
you just got to be strong enough
to deal with it.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.159
Hm.

34:26.159 --> 34:29.130
Well, it's just
over the rise.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.199
You know a lot
about me, man.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.670
What about you?

34:34.670 --> 34:37.800
What are you doing
out here?

34:37.800 --> 34:40.340
Well,
like I said,

34:40.340 --> 34:44.610
sometimes things don't turn out
the way you want,

34:44.610 --> 34:48.179
and you got to find the strength
to deal with it.

34:48.179 --> 34:50.820
So you see, kid,

34:50.820 --> 34:52.550
you're not alone.

34:52.550 --> 34:55.719
(<i> somber theme playing</i> )

Dad!

I'm sorry,
Duwayne.

They had me
covered.

Where's our goods, kid?

35:39.270 --> 35:41.700
I want to know where you
stashed our merchandise!

He doesn't have it.

a new face, huh?

35:48.080 --> 35:49.270
Well, you're about
to get one

35:49.280 --> 35:51.180
if you don't give us
what we want.

a young Ranger,

37:15.200 --> 37:17.060
this was the only
kind of road we had.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.530
This is nothin' compared
to some roads I've been down.

37:19.530 --> 37:21.900
You see anything yet?

37:21.900 --> 37:24.300
Jackrabbits and coyote.

Walker's out here. We just gotta
keep going till we see a sign.

the chopper?

No.

cleared the trees.

was there?

China white.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.200
Whoa,
you done good, kid.

39:06.210 --> 39:07.970
But I'm not sure
it's such a good idea.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.840
Oh, man.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.980
If it's pure,
we can step on it.

39:11.980 --> 39:14.610
Nine hundred thousand,
street value. Maybe a mil.

39:26.330 --> 39:29.060
So where's this cave?

39:29.060 --> 39:31.500
It's up that way
by the gully,

39:31.500 --> 39:33.930
but then you promise
we go back for Walker.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.280
What is it?

40:18.280 --> 40:20.980
Rattlesnake head,
cut clean.

40:20.980 --> 40:23.650
Two sets of tracks
off in that gully.

They're going to be
hell hard to follow too.

40:25.890 --> 40:28.250

40:55.080 --> 40:57.850
It's right--
Right over here. Right here.

41:00.890 --> 41:01.890
Where is it?

41:01.890 --> 41:03.790
It's inside.

41:05.460 --> 41:06.790
Where? Over here?

41:06.790 --> 41:08.790
Yeah.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.130
We've been up here an hour,
we got nothin'.

41:17.140 --> 41:19.100
And we're running
out of fuel.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.670
You wanna head for the trees
and find me that jeep?

41:33.190 --> 41:34.750
Here it is,

41:34.750 --> 41:37.390

it was, Duwayne.

Oh, my ship's come in.

This is my big shot.

I can't let
this happen again.

What are you
talking about?

41:47.870 --> 41:49.870
You getting in trouble
with the law.

41:49.870 --> 41:50.970
Don't preach
to me, kid.

41:50.970 --> 41:52.670
I had enough of that
from your stepmother.

41:53.640 --> 41:54.870
Well, maybe she's right.

41:54.870 --> 41:56.940
Maybe I've had my ears plugged
this whole time.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.780
That guy back there
saved my life.

42:02.780 --> 42:04.020
We've got to go back for him.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.350
We got the dope.
We don't owe him nothing.

42:06.350 --> 42:09.720
Walker helped me,
and he saved your life.

42:15.060 --> 42:16.690
There.
There he is.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.200
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

42:20.870 --> 42:22.200
Come on.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.870
No, I'm not going
with you.

42:23.870 --> 42:26.740
You're not going?
That's your problem.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.000
( grunts )

42:54.330 --> 42:56.070
( gunshots )

43:02.580 --> 43:03.910
( grunts )

43:04.780 --> 43:06.510
Hey, Mancini!
( gasps )

43:06.510 --> 43:07.510
( grunts )

43:07.510 --> 43:08.710
Put your hands up
on your head

43:08.720 --> 43:10.580
or I'll blow wind under you.

43:12.990 --> 43:14.220
( grunts )

43:33.610 --> 43:35.670
You know, I've seen
your mug shot.

43:35.680 --> 43:38.910
You're a lot more impressive
in person. Get--!

43:38.910 --> 43:39.910
You know the drill.

43:43.220 --> 43:44.380
Walker,

43:44.380 --> 43:45.720
are you okay?

43:45.720 --> 43:47.820
I--
Give me a hand.

43:57.860 --> 44:00.430
So all he wanted
was the dope, huh?

44:00.430 --> 44:02.330
Yeah.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.670
Yeah, that's all
he wanted.

44:06.340 --> 44:08.670
It was all a sham,

44:08.680 --> 44:10.710
him telling me
he loved me,

44:10.710 --> 44:12.410
and we'd be together
someday.

44:13.480 --> 44:16.450
I'm sorry, Duwayne.

44:16.450 --> 44:17.580
Yeah.

44:17.580 --> 44:20.820
Well, sometimes,

44:20.820 --> 44:22.420
things don't work out
the way you want,

44:22.420 --> 44:25.190
but you have to be strong enough
to deal with it, right?

44:26.960 --> 44:29.330
Right.

44:37.140 --> 44:39.770
( on radio ):
<i> Walker, this is</i>
<i> Trivette. Come in.</i>

44:39.770 --> 44:40.970
Walker.

44:40.970 --> 44:42.640
<i> Walker, where are you?</i>
<i> I got good news, man.</i>

44:42.640 --> 44:44.040
Your boy
at the hospital,

44:44.040 --> 44:46.280
the doctor says his prognosis
is a full recovery.

44:46.280 --> 44:48.580
Ah, that is good news.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.650
I think
I'll go by the hospital

44:51.650 --> 44:54.090
after I make a stop.

45:00.230 --> 45:01.960
Hi, Duwayne.
Hey, Walker,

45:01.960 --> 45:03.330
what are you
doing here?

45:03.330 --> 45:05.200
I thought I'd drop by
and see how you're doing.

45:05.200 --> 45:06.600
Oh, I'm doing good.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.700
How's everything going
with your stepmother?

45:08.700 --> 45:10.970
Much better.
Much better.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.340
Can I say hello
to her?

45:13.340 --> 45:15.570
Oh, yeah.
Come on in.

45:19.980 --> 45:20.980
WALKER:
Mrs. Parsons?

45:20.980 --> 45:22.280
Uh, yes.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.550
I'm
Cordell Walker.

45:23.550 --> 45:24.580
Oh, hello.

45:24.580 --> 45:25.850
I've heard
so much about you.

45:25.850 --> 45:28.850
Well, Duwayne's told me
a lot about you too.

45:28.860 --> 45:31.860
I, uh, have something
here for you.

45:31.860 --> 45:33.420
Uh, actually,
it's for Duwayne,

45:33.430 --> 45:35.160
but I think he'd like
for you to have it.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.390
Well, what is it?

45:36.400 --> 45:38.600
Well, there was a reward
for the man that we captured.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.830
Because of Duwayne's help,
we were able to apprehend him,

45:40.830 --> 45:44.040
and so we hope
that will help you out.

45:44.040 --> 45:46.070
Well, hah, thanks.

45:46.070 --> 45:47.470
Well, it's a pleasure
meeting you.

45:47.470 --> 45:49.140
Nice to meet you too.

45:49.140 --> 45:51.840
Well, Duwayne,
it's good seeing you again.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.080
You take care, okay?

45:53.080 --> 45:55.110
Yeah.

45:55.110 --> 45:56.180
You too.

45:56.180 --> 45:59.120
(<i> upbeat theme playing</i> )

45:59.120 --> 46:00.350
Bye.

46:06.790 --> 46:10.930

Fifty thousand dollars?!
Oh, my God, we're rich!
