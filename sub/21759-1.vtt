Morning, Nanny.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.960
Dogs taking you
for a walk again?

01:28.960 --> 01:32.330
Oh Harris, that gets
funnier every day.

01:32.330 --> 01:35.790
Come on, Rolly.
We've got to hightail it
to the museum.

01:35.790 --> 01:39.170
We don't want to miss
the Fire Hydrants
of the World exhibit.

01:39.170 --> 01:41.500
Just send me
a postcard, Lucky.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.120
I'm getting
a cramp here.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.210
I'm getting a cramp, too--
a big giant smile cramp.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.210
Nanny: Help!

01:50.210 --> 01:52.000
Hand it over,
lady.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.170
Oh, my purse! Help!

01:54.170 --> 01:55.710
-Nanny: Help! Thief!
-Thief: Ha ha ha!

01:55.710 --> 01:57.620
Come on,
we got to catch him!

02:02.040 --> 02:04.580
Nanny: Oh! Ooh!

02:04.580 --> 02:06.960
What a rush!

02:06.960 --> 02:09.170
Ooh, the cramp.
Ooh, the cramp!

02:09.170 --> 02:10.710
He's getting away!

02:21.880 --> 02:25.210
Bring back that purse,
you big jerk!

02:25.210 --> 02:28.670
Oh. I really got to work
on my underlying hostility.

02:39.170 --> 02:44.000
Oh, what's the matter?
Does puppy want
the purse back, huh?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.920
Huh!

02:51.040 --> 02:53.250
Gee, I--

02:57.210 --> 02:59.120
-Oh!

03:05.790 --> 03:11.120
Oh, thank you, Lucky.
That was very brave of you.

03:11.120 --> 03:15.120
Yeah. Somebody's
got to take a bite
out of crime.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.170
Yeah, right.

03:26.170 --> 03:30.040
What a dramatic
day it's been.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.210
Yeah. I think
I pulled my groin.

03:33.210 --> 03:36.250
I just love
the city--

03:36.250 --> 03:38.920
Full of excitement
and adventure and...

03:38.920 --> 03:42.540
Pollution and crowds
and now Nanny
getting mugged.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.500
Oh. What's happened
to this city?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.120
Aah! Whoa!

03:46.120 --> 03:50.540
We need more room
for the puppies, Anita,
and fresh air for us.

03:50.540 --> 03:54.580
When are we going to buy
that place in the country
we're always talking about?

03:54.580 --> 03:56.170
Funny you should
mention it.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.580
Perdy?

03:59.880 --> 04:02.040
Hmm. What's this?

04:04.880 --> 04:07.750
Oh, Anita,
this is perfect.

04:07.750 --> 04:10.000
Anita: It's owned by
a lovely widow.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.040
Over 20 acres,
plenty of room.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.170
There are cows
and chickens and
even other dogs.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.830
I say
we make an offer.

04:19.670 --> 04:23.880
We can't move.
I know every deli
dumpster in town!

04:23.880 --> 04:25.120
The country?

04:25.120 --> 04:27.210
And leave all our
city friends behind?

04:27.210 --> 04:29.120
That's crazy talk!

04:29.120 --> 04:31.210
I know the puppies
love it here,

04:31.210 --> 04:34.080
But I'm sure they'll
grow to love it there.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.380
I've decided
we should do it.

04:35.380 --> 04:36.920
Hey, do you hear that,
everybody?

04:36.920 --> 04:39.290
We are moving
to the country!

04:39.290 --> 04:43.040
Let me make myself
perfectly clear.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.120
We are not moving.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.920
So this is the country.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.210
Well, let's have
ourselves a gander.

05:33.790 --> 05:37.120
Howdy, buckaroo.
How's it going?

05:38.960 --> 05:41.330
You like watching
Thunderbolt ?

05:41.330 --> 05:43.710
On TV?

05:43.710 --> 05:45.750
You know, cable?

05:45.750 --> 05:46.920
What's cable?

05:46.920 --> 05:49.210
Okay.

05:49.210 --> 05:52.670
Nope. Sorry.
No restaurants for miles.

05:52.670 --> 05:54.750
Miles?

05:54.750 --> 05:57.460
But you're free
to stop by anytime

05:57.460 --> 06:01.290
and have some slop with me
and my daughter Dumpling.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.500
Mmm!

06:08.120 --> 06:09.790
Spicy!

06:09.790 --> 06:10.920
Hello!

06:10.920 --> 06:15.380
My name is Cadpig,
and you two are...

06:15.380 --> 06:17.000
cows.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.830
Name tags will help
us all bond

06:18.830 --> 06:21.750
in a friendly
yet functional
fashion.

06:24.540 --> 06:27.290
No more begging
for hot dogs,

06:27.290 --> 06:30.750
no spicy sausages,
no falafel.

06:30.750 --> 06:35.960
We got to get back
to civilization
before I waste away!

06:35.960 --> 06:38.210
And I'm having
trouble getting
centered.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.580
It's all this
unfamiliarity.

06:40.580 --> 06:43.790
I need a sense
of place!

06:43.790 --> 06:44.920
Ugh!

06:44.920 --> 06:48.330
How could this
possibly get
any worse?

07:00.580 --> 07:03.420
Welcome wagon!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
What's she
doing here?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.250
For my new neighbors.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.830
"Happy bar mitzvah,
Howard"?

07:13.830 --> 07:16.540
Well It's all they had
at that filthy,

07:16.540 --> 07:19.880
fat-infested
Doughnut Shack
in Grutely.

07:22.580 --> 07:23.750
Memo to myself--

07:23.750 --> 07:27.380
Buy the Doughnut
Shack in Grutely
and fire everyone!

07:27.380 --> 07:30.000
Anita, Rupert,
the real reason

07:30.000 --> 07:31.960
I stopped by
to say hello

07:31.960 --> 07:34.380
is so that I could
say good-bye.

07:34.380 --> 07:36.040
You see, I want
to buy the place.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.960
The property bumps
right against mine,

07:37.960 --> 07:41.580
and that moth-eaten
Widow Smedley wouldn't
sell it to me.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.790
But you will.

07:42.790 --> 07:43.960
Why?

07:43.960 --> 07:46.670
Because, Anita,
you work for me,

07:46.670 --> 07:48.710
and you want
to please me.

07:48.710 --> 07:53.000
So I'm prepared
to offer you double
what you paid.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.460
Roger: Sorry, Cruella,
but your money's
no good here.

07:55.460 --> 07:56.750
-Triple it.
-No.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.210
Quadruple it!

07:58.210 --> 07:59.420
No can do.

07:59.420 --> 08:01.040
What do you
want, Rudolph?

08:01.040 --> 08:02.790
Name your price.

08:02.790 --> 08:04.670
It's not for sale.

08:04.670 --> 08:07.920
This farm now belongs
to us and the dalmatians.

08:09.080 --> 08:13.290
The dalmatians, yes.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.170
Tell me,
are there still 101,

08:15.170 --> 08:18.620
or did I manage to
take out a couple of
the mutts when I drove in?

08:18.620 --> 08:21.210
Ha ha ha!

08:23.330 --> 08:27.040
Ooh. I'm picking
up some negative
energy.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.500
Cruella: Come, Scorch.
I don't want you
getting fleas.

08:34.290 --> 08:36.920
Well, if you change
your minds, let me know.

08:36.920 --> 08:41.750
Meanwhile, I hope
you all enjoy your little
Barkingham Palace.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.500
Ha ha ha!

08:45.960 --> 08:52.210
Memo to myself--
come up with a diabolical
scheme to steal this farm!

09:37.040 --> 09:39.540
Aah! I can't take it!

09:46.750 --> 09:48.540
It's too
noisy here.

09:48.540 --> 09:50.580
And too hot and humid.

09:50.580 --> 09:53.170
And too... farmy.

09:53.170 --> 09:56.580
My primal needs cry
for a brownstone,

09:56.580 --> 09:58.670
not a barnyard.

09:58.670 --> 10:01.120
And central
air conditioning.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.120
And there's only one
place we're going
to get all that--

10:04.120 --> 10:07.120
Back in the city,
back home,

10:07.120 --> 10:09.250
and that's where
we're going.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.580
Home.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.000
Home!

10:48.960 --> 10:50.710
Home, sweet home!

10:52.330 --> 10:55.920
Cadpig: Our
beautiful brownstone!

10:55.920 --> 10:57.750
Come on.
Let's go!

11:01.290 --> 11:03.460
Well, well.

11:03.460 --> 11:07.750
Looks like three little
dalmatians have lost their way.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.080
Run!

11:27.460 --> 11:29.380
Gotcha!
What?

11:30.420 --> 11:31.620
Gone!

11:34.670 --> 11:36.540
Whew!

11:39.420 --> 11:41.420
Well, we made it home.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.420
That's where
the picture of Mom and Dad
was hanging, remember?

11:46.420 --> 11:48.460
And here's where
Nanny used to

11:48.460 --> 11:51.880
light an aromatherapy
candle every night.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.710
Ahh! So soothing.

11:53.710 --> 11:56.420
And here's where
we kept the TV.

11:56.420 --> 11:58.960
Isn't it great to be back?

11:58.960 --> 12:00.790
Yeah.

12:00.790 --> 12:02.670
I guess.

12:06.830 --> 12:10.330
Ha ha ha!

12:16.330 --> 12:18.380
Those three puppies
are the key

12:18.380 --> 12:20.500
to my acquiring
the keys to that farm!

12:22.000 --> 12:25.750
I hold them for ransom,
forcing Rodney and Anita
to sell the farm.

12:25.750 --> 12:29.670
Then they'll give me my own
money back to pay the ransom!

12:29.670 --> 12:30.620
Ha ha!

12:34.540 --> 12:36.040
These collars
will convince them.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.670
Don't interrupt me!

12:39.670 --> 12:41.620
Secretary: But H and J
Concepts is here.

12:41.620 --> 12:43.670
Send them in.

12:43.670 --> 12:45.540
Afternoon, Ms. DeVil.

12:45.540 --> 12:49.210
H and J Concepts
at your service.

12:49.210 --> 12:52.540
We're consultants.
Whatever you're in need of,
we're your guys.

12:52.540 --> 12:54.880
From plant trimming...
Ah. Uh-huh.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.250
To removing a stubborn
spot from your blouse.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.250
Listen, you
brainless warts!

13:01.250 --> 13:03.960
I have an envelope
in need of delivery,

13:03.960 --> 13:06.580
and I want it done
discreetly,

13:06.580 --> 13:11.330
and by that I mean
I do not want them to know
it's from Cruella DeVil.

13:11.330 --> 13:13.080
Got it?

13:17.500 --> 13:20.580
Afternoon, ma'am.
We have an envelope
to deliver.

13:20.580 --> 13:23.620
And it's not from
Cruella DeVil.

13:24.420 --> 13:27.170
I mean, it is
from Cruella DeVil.

13:27.170 --> 13:28.500
Oh!

13:28.500 --> 13:29.460
Ooh!

13:29.460 --> 13:32.000
I mean, I didn't
say anything.

13:34.790 --> 13:39.460
Anybody ever tell you,
you have beautiful eyes?

13:39.460 --> 13:40.880
Ah!

13:42.540 --> 13:45.330
Roger: What do you mean,
call the dog pound?

13:45.330 --> 13:46.670
Look, I'm telling you,

13:46.670 --> 13:49.620
our puppies are being
held for ransom
by Cruella DeVil.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.830
Sheriff: You say Cruella DeVil
is responsible?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.420
Of course Cruella did it!

13:53.420 --> 13:57.170
Who else sends ransom notes
that are dry clean only?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.580
Ooh...

13:59.580 --> 14:03.460
Oh, the sheriff's no help.
He's probably on Cruella's
payroll, too.

14:03.460 --> 14:06.580
Oh, Roger, you don't
know that for sure.

14:09.170 --> 14:11.710
And we've got to give
Cruella the benefit
of the doubt.

14:11.710 --> 14:13.750
We have no real
evidence she did it,

14:13.750 --> 14:16.040
and she's not
so bad when you
get to know her.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.620
I know her as well
as I ever wanted to,

14:18.620 --> 14:20.750
and I know something else.

14:20.750 --> 14:24.170
The only way to raise
that ransom money is
to sell the farm.

14:24.170 --> 14:27.460
Oh! There has to be
a better way.

14:29.670 --> 14:31.330
Perdy: Do you think
this will work?

14:31.330 --> 14:32.920
Pongo: It's our only hope.

14:36.670 --> 14:41.500
(dogs barking in
the distance)

14:44.960 --> 14:48.920
Lucky: Isn't it fun
spending the night?
Just like old times.

14:48.920 --> 14:53.250
Oh! I don't remember
freezing my butt
off, Lucky.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.420
Back at the barn,
you were hot!

14:55.420 --> 14:57.500
Well, now
I'm cold.

14:57.500 --> 15:01.290
I'm hungry,
both physically
and spiritually.

15:01.290 --> 15:04.420
I still miss
my friends.

15:05.460 --> 15:08.290
Oh! Should never
have left home.

15:08.290 --> 15:11.080
What? But that barn's
not our home.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.540
This is our home.

15:12.540 --> 15:15.460
You two just relax.
I'll find some food.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.460
Uhh!

15:24.500 --> 15:27.540
Rat: Hey!
Can't you see
a guy's trying to sleep?

15:36.580 --> 15:40.580
♪ ♪

15:56.830 --> 15:59.040
Lucky, what
are you doing?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.880
Trying to get
the door open!

16:06.880 --> 16:08.670
Uhh!

16:08.670 --> 16:11.000
But I think it's locked.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.500
You mean,
we're going home?

16:13.500 --> 16:16.330
If we find a way out.

16:16.330 --> 16:17.790
I've got an idea!

16:19.710 --> 16:21.420
Are you sure
this is going to work?

16:21.420 --> 16:22.500
Trust me.

16:26.250 --> 16:29.000
Ah-ah-chew!

16:29.000 --> 16:30.580
Whoa!

16:32.460 --> 16:35.500
This feels
very familiar.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.540
Ah, it'll
never work.

16:43.210 --> 16:47.290
Ooh! Shouldn't
I have been on top?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.250
Cruella: I'm off
to buy the farm.

16:51.250 --> 16:55.330
You two get in there and put
those mutts in this sack.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.790
Then wait to hear from me.
Understand?

16:57.790 --> 16:59.290
Jasper: You can count
on us, ma'am.

16:59.290 --> 17:00.710
Whoa!

17:00.710 --> 17:01.750
Uhh!

17:01.750 --> 17:03.330
What's going on?

17:03.330 --> 17:06.620
Cruella's up to something.
We've got to hide.

17:09.750 --> 17:10.960
Ooh!

17:10.960 --> 17:12.380
Puppies?

17:12.380 --> 17:14.540
Puppies!

17:14.540 --> 17:17.920
Horace: They must really love
them if they're willing to sell
the whole farm to Cruella

17:17.920 --> 17:19.960
just to get them
back, huh, Jasper?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.380
Just find
the puppies.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.210
There they are!

17:30.330 --> 17:32.380
Jasper: Oh! Get out
of my way, will ya?

17:34.170 --> 17:35.250
Huh?

17:36.920 --> 17:39.500
-Come on!

17:39.500 --> 17:43.290
We got to get back before
Roger and Anita sell the farm!

18:04.920 --> 18:06.120
Lucky: Hey, look!

18:09.120 --> 18:11.000
We need a ride.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.330
Scottie: A ride?

18:12.330 --> 18:13.540
Ho ho!
I do not think--

18:13.540 --> 18:16.250
Well, blow me bagpipes!

18:16.250 --> 18:20.040
Do you three be
Pongo and Perdy's puppies?

18:20.040 --> 18:21.330
That we be.

18:21.330 --> 18:23.000
Scottie: Well, hop aboard!

18:23.000 --> 18:25.670
Heard all about ye
on the barking chain.

18:31.380 --> 18:35.830
Rolly: It's over.
There's no way
we can outrun her car.

18:35.830 --> 18:38.380
Scottie: I'll take care of her.
You three get going!

18:52.670 --> 18:54.170
Colonel, wake up!

18:54.170 --> 18:55.420
Colonel!

18:55.420 --> 18:58.540
Oh! What? Uh...
Oh, hello. What?

18:58.540 --> 19:01.540
A message about
the puppies.

19:01.540 --> 19:05.420
Oh, uh, the-- the puppies
are on their way,

19:05.420 --> 19:07.120
and so is Cruella!

19:07.120 --> 19:09.710
We've got to stop her
before she gets to the farm.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.000
Meow!

19:20.830 --> 19:24.040
All right, we've got
our orders. Let's go!

19:50.120 --> 19:52.380
Oink!

19:52.380 --> 19:54.710
Neigh!

19:54.710 --> 19:56.170
Moo!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.120
Now!

20:05.250 --> 20:06.290
Oh!

20:16.710 --> 20:20.170
I picked the wrong week
to quit smoking.

20:20.170 --> 20:22.040
Arf! Arf! Arf!

20:22.040 --> 20:24.210
Come back here,
you mutts!

20:28.210 --> 20:29.380
Ha ha ha!

20:30.540 --> 20:32.040
Aha!

20:32.040 --> 20:33.790
I've got you
this time!

20:33.790 --> 20:35.460
-Anita: Why,
hello, Cruella.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.080
Care to explain?

20:37.080 --> 20:38.540
Hmm

20:38.540 --> 20:41.880
Oh! Oh, yes,
the puppies.

20:41.880 --> 20:47.670
Well, I, uh,
I found them wandering
around lost, you know.

20:47.670 --> 20:50.250
So I was just
bringing them to you.

20:50.250 --> 20:54.620
See, Roger?
I told you Cruella
wasn't behind this.

20:54.620 --> 20:59.580
Well, well! I guess I had you
pegged all wrong, Cruella,

20:59.580 --> 21:02.920
And now, with the puppies back,
we don't have to pay the ransom,

21:02.920 --> 21:08.170
and we can live on the farm
for a long, long, long time!

21:08.170 --> 21:09.330
Humph!

21:09.330 --> 21:11.170
Memo to myself--

21:11.170 --> 21:13.710
Come up with another scheme
to steal this farm!

21:15.380 --> 21:17.210
Nanny, bring some food
for the puppies.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.540
I think they're hungry.

21:18.540 --> 21:21.040
Who cares
about the food?

21:21.040 --> 21:23.540
I'm just glad
to be home.

21:23.540 --> 21:26.080
Well, I care
about the food!

21:26.080 --> 21:30.420
Princess,
I'm personally thanking
each and every one of you

21:30.420 --> 21:34.080
for helping bring us back
together with our family.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.880
And now that I'm back,

21:35.880 --> 21:39.710
I would like to
revive the name tag
distribution program.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.960
I still don't know
where I'm going to find food

21:46.960 --> 21:49.000
out here in the middle
of a farm.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.080
Hey, apples!

21:59.080 --> 22:01.920
♪ ♪

22:01.920 --> 22:04.170
It's good to be home.
