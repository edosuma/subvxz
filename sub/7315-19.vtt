00:05.834 --> 00:07.610
VANCE: Gibbs. Think you
two know each other.

00:07.635 --> 00:08.528
Hello, my brother.

00:08.529 --> 00:10.167
TONY: <i>A living legend</i>

00:14.035 --> 00:16.202
I have known SSA
Pride for 30 years.

00:16.204 --> 00:18.120
I trust him with my life.
I'm Special Agent LaSalle.

00:18.121 --> 00:18.804
I'm Brody.

00:18.829 --> 00:20.829
SAC said he was sending
some extra manpower.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.591
You got woman power instead.

00:22.593 --> 00:25.511
McLane being a congressman,
FBI's on its way.

00:25.513 --> 00:28.013
Dan taught me everything I know.
Murder of a congressman, Duck.

00:28.015 --> 00:29.998
DUCKY: Yeah, well, this
man was a friend.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.301
And a highly decorated
federal agent.

00:32.302 --> 00:35.671
Murders all tied to Victor
Lorta, the salesman the Fed Five

00:35.673 --> 00:37.640
convicted as
the Privileged killer.

00:37.642 --> 00:39.608
We were the probies
along for the ride.

00:39.610 --> 00:41.026
McLane was the one who
put it all together.

00:41.028 --> 00:42.311
He's the one
who connected it to Lorta.

00:42.313 --> 00:44.012
There might be
a killer on the loose.

00:44.014 --> 00:45.064
Copycat.

00:45.066 --> 00:46.732
The murders seem to be
focused in New Orleans.

01:55.219 --> 01:57.770
We got a body

02:15.956 --> 02:17.956
Reminds me
of the country roads back home.

02:17.958 --> 02:19.958
Where's that?
Oklahoma.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.460
Ah.
(chuckles)

02:21.462 --> 02:23.662
I helped open a clinic
for the Chickasaw

02:23.664 --> 02:25.497

You raised here, local?

02:29.804 --> 02:31.220
Mmm. Santa Fe originally,

02:31.222 --> 02:33.389
then I spent some
time in Austin,

02:33.391 --> 02:36.258
went up to Cambridge, Mass,
before I found down here.

02:36.260 --> 02:36.838
Harvard?

02:36.863 --> 02:39.183
I traded in the crimson for
the purple and gold. (chuckles)

02:40.264 --> 02:43.298
Either one of you know anything
about college football?

02:43.300 --> 02:44.933
Nah.

02:44.935 --> 02:46.435
Not much.
I got the crawfish

02:46.437 --> 02:50.138
in my blood now, so don't
be putting down my Tigers.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.474
This town...

02:52.476 --> 02:54.693

02:54.695 --> 02:57.646
I flew out here for
a visit in '97.

02:57.648 --> 02:59.865
Still got the return ticket.

03:01.918 --> 03:04.620
I know folks die the same here

03:04.622 --> 03:08.791
but in New Orleans...
most people depart

03:08.793 --> 03:12.678

04:54.448 --> 04:56.932
Anyone got any handcuffs

04:56.934 --> 04:58.433
Got a body in Barataria.

04:58.435 --> 04:59.952

Okay, two puncture wounds

06:12.276 --> 06:13.559
in the abdomen.

06:13.561 --> 06:16.228
And by the looks
of that bone chip,

06:16.230 --> 06:18.981
I'd say his throat was cut
pretty good, too.

06:20.349 --> 06:21.316
Same M.O. as Privileged.

Old Maurice over there

06:23.954 --> 06:25.988
swamp tour business

06:25.990 --> 06:28.523
He and a boat full
of Japanese tourists

06:28.525 --> 06:29.992
found him here
in the water.

06:29.994 --> 06:31.359
Yeah, they thought
it was a fake skeleton,

06:31.361 --> 06:33.412

06:33.414 --> 06:35.464
I've got cloth fibers...

06:35.466 --> 06:38.033
under the victim's fingernails.

06:38.035 --> 06:39.668
Could be
the killer's clothing.

06:42.005 --> 06:44.723
Got a tire track over
here in the mud.

06:45.975 --> 06:49.428
PRIDE: Actual boat ramp

06:51.097 --> 06:52.648
This is where our copycat
dumped McLane.

06:52.650 --> 06:55.216
Current carried the remains
from here down to the marina.

06:55.218 --> 06:57.519
I'll get a cast of these treads.
Talk to the family.

06:57.521 --> 06:59.821
Confirm how long
Mr. Waynesgaard was missing.

06:59.823 --> 07:02.240
That'll help us get closer
to time of death.

07:02.242 --> 07:04.860
If he wasn't military
or public service,

07:04.862 --> 07:06.328
then why kill him?

07:06.330 --> 07:09.114
He saw a copycat that night
face-to-face.

07:11.334 --> 07:13.785
It's what got him killed.

07:23.292 --> 07:26.961

Brown paper packages

07:29.599 --> 07:32.133
This is from our blonde
probie down in the Big Easy.

07:32.135 --> 07:33.551
It's probably
just a souvenir.

"A serial killer's on

07:35.572 --> 07:36.637

07:36.639 --> 07:38.156
No, this...
this feels different.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.191
Maybe it's a tasty
Southern treat.

07:40.193 --> 07:43.278
Coffee beans...
soaked in chicory.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.913
Maybe some beads
I can throw at women

07:44.915 --> 07:46.981
after they show me their...
Is that actually legal?

07:46.983 --> 07:48.449
I don't know.

07:48.451 --> 07:50.668
Sometimes rules are meant
to be broken, Tim.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.120
Just open the box.

08:03.498 --> 08:05.666

08:05.668 --> 08:06.851
Right down to

08:06.853 --> 08:09.354

What does the note say?

08:11.390 --> 08:14.642
"Little Tony will bring you
good luck and happiness."

08:14.644 --> 08:16.444
That's not funny.
There's nothing funny about

08:16.446 --> 08:20.181

<i>and Let Die</i> when I was a kid.

08:20.183 --> 08:21.899

Thank you again, Warden.

08:39.669 --> 08:42.086
We appreciate your cooperation.

08:42.087 --> 08:45.673
The world knew Victor Lorta
as the Privileged killer.

08:45.675 --> 08:48.176
I'm hoping that
these letters you saved

08:48.178 --> 08:50.711
will offer some insight
into the man as well.

08:50.713 --> 08:52.730
Yes. Thank you.
We'll speak again soon.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.015
Let me guess.

08:54.017 --> 08:55.233
Victor Lorta

08:55.235 --> 08:56.651
maintained some significant

08:56.653 --> 08:58.936
letter-writing relationships.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.655
Nobody writes letters anymore.

09:00.657 --> 09:03.691
Except maximum-security
prisoners who don't have

09:03.693 --> 09:05.076
access to Wi-Fi.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.445
VANCE: When Agent McLane
arrested the Privileged killer,

09:07.447 --> 09:09.247
he was a two-bit salesman.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.866
Overnight, the case
became front-page news.

09:11.868 --> 09:14.202
The Fed Five gained
national recognition.

09:14.204 --> 09:15.837
Lorta became a celebrity.

09:15.839 --> 09:18.039
When it comes
to public curiosity,

09:18.041 --> 09:22.093
murderers are more intriguing
than heroes of war.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.594
The more
Lorta claimed

09:23.596 --> 09:26.597
he was innocent, the more
he developed a fan base.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.549
Some people collect
photos of movie stars...

09:28.551 --> 09:31.919
And others prefer to correspond
with the devil incarnate.

09:31.921 --> 09:34.222
The warden at the prison
where Lorta was housed,

09:34.224 --> 09:35.723
he knew he was unique.

09:35.725 --> 09:38.426
Kept every note
and every letter after he died.

09:38.428 --> 09:40.061
You think our copycat might be

09:40.063 --> 09:42.647
one of these
letter-writing nutjobs?

09:42.649 --> 09:45.433
Well, it's a long shot,
I know, but these...

09:45.435 --> 09:47.035
these people admired Lorta.

09:47.037 --> 09:49.654
Makes sense
that they might mimic him.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.772
Well, Director, you enlisted my

09:51.774 --> 09:54.242
psychological expertise, so...

09:54.244 --> 09:57.161
I am eager
and very willing

09:57.163 --> 10:00.948
to find out what
Lorta's fan club has to say.

10:00.950 --> 10:04.585
And if, indeed, there
is a copycat out there...

10:04.587 --> 10:07.972
Maybe one of his pen pals
is continuing his legacy.

10:08.924 --> 10:11.092
BRODY:
We know there's no logical link

10:11.094 --> 10:12.560
to connect
Waynesgaard

10:12.562 --> 10:13.627
to the Privileged murders.

10:13.629 --> 10:14.979
No public service,

10:14.981 --> 10:16.314
no military background.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.132
So prove Agent Gibbs's theory.

10:19.468 --> 10:22.670
What's this?

10:22.672 --> 10:24.906
Oh. Sorry. That's... that's

10:24.908 --> 10:27.575
one of mine right there.
Your what exactly?

10:27.577 --> 10:28.609
One of my brother's LEGO bricks.

10:28.611 --> 10:30.695
You're kidding, right?

10:30.697 --> 10:32.980
Oh, we don't kid about LEGO.

10:32.982 --> 10:34.332
You play with toys at work?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.317
Oh, it's not toys.
I make sculptures.

10:36.319 --> 10:38.652
Landmarks, buildings.

10:40.089 --> 10:42.256
What is that?
What is that? That...

10:42.258 --> 10:44.208
Is that a serious question?

10:44.210 --> 10:45.826
It's the Superdome.
(scoffs)

10:45.828 --> 10:46.328
Huh.

10:46.334 --> 10:48.297
He made a really good
Preservation Hall, too.

10:48.298 --> 10:49.263
With the musicians.

10:49.265 --> 10:50.798
Out of LEGO bricks?
Mm-hmm.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.350
Yeah, I started doing it
at the Children's Hospital

10:52.352 --> 10:53.768
a few years back after Katrina.

10:53.770 --> 10:55.553
Kids like playing
with them.

10:56.638 --> 10:58.339
(phone ringing)

10:58.341 --> 10:59.607
Brody.

10:59.609 --> 11:01.025
Hello?

11:01.027 --> 11:02.477
Hello?

11:02.479 --> 11:03.861
Another hang-up?
Third today.

11:03.863 --> 11:05.196
Probably has
something to do with

11:05.198 --> 11:07.031
the business cards I left
at Doyle's crime scene.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.682
Maybe a witness.
Let's head over there.

11:08.684 --> 11:11.319
Give them someone
to talk to.

11:11.321 --> 11:12.870
LaSALLE:
I'll take Gibbs

11:12.872 --> 11:14.322
and Bishop.
PRIDE: Can't.

11:14.324 --> 11:15.957
They're at the Jefferson
Parish Lab with Hobbs.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.325
You left them
alone with Hobbs?

11:17.327 --> 11:18.659
What's so bad about Hobbs?

11:18.661 --> 11:20.461
(chuckles)

11:20.463 --> 11:22.747
(blues playing
on electric keyboard)

11:38.730 --> 11:41.232
How long do we
let him play for?

11:41.234 --> 11:42.883
Uh, Pride says it relaxes him.

11:42.885 --> 11:44.569
It helps him think.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.488
Um, Mr. Hobbs...

11:47.490 --> 11:49.323
Call me Wendell.
GIBBS: Wendell,

11:49.325 --> 11:51.075
we need the crime-scene results.

11:52.727 --> 11:55.696
DNA under Henry Waynesgaard's
fingernails was compromised.

11:55.698 --> 11:58.166
But those military
textile fibers Loretta found--

11:58.168 --> 12:00.568
those turned out
to be almost 70 years old.

12:00.570 --> 12:02.336
You saying the copycat is older?

12:02.338 --> 12:05.573
No, sir.
I'm saying the jacket was.

12:05.575 --> 12:07.008
I'm saying your killer

12:07.010 --> 12:08.693
probably likes
to play Navy dress-up.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.795
Clothes could come
from a thrift store

12:10.797 --> 12:12.296
or old military surplus.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.915
He likes the way
they make him feel.

12:14.917 --> 12:17.935
Likes what they turn him into.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.773
TONY:
Based on these letters,

12:22.775 --> 12:24.609
Lorta was a big hit
with the ladies.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.862
Some people get a thrill out of
communicating with the deranged.

12:27.864 --> 12:29.864
Like taunting the
lion at the zoo.

12:29.866 --> 12:32.600
As long as the danger's
behind bars, they're safe.

12:32.602 --> 12:34.935
I just found a letter CC'd
to then-Agent McLane

12:34.937 --> 12:36.937
and someone named Josef Hanlon.

12:36.939 --> 12:38.623
Hanlon.
TONY: Yeah, he's one of

12:38.625 --> 12:39.991
the congressman's
sugar daddies.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.459
Big financial sponsor
out of North Carolina.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.544
Lives here in DC now.

12:43.546 --> 12:44.879
Go see Hanlon.

12:44.881 --> 12:46.780
Find out why one of
Lorta's whack-jobs

12:46.782 --> 12:48.165
contacted him directly.

12:50.302 --> 12:52.803
Stand here long enough,
the caller might notice.

12:54.122 --> 12:56.090
LaSALLE: Second-story windows
have the best view.

12:56.092 --> 12:57.475
Folks are afraid to talk.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.510
We could offer
a reward or something.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.597
Got a coupon for Waffle
House in my wallet.

13:06.301 --> 13:07.801
This your crime scene?

13:11.406 --> 13:13.741
Which one of you is Brody?

13:13.743 --> 13:15.776
I am.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.414
Found your card.

13:20.416 --> 13:23.000
You're a long way
from home, baby.

13:24.253 --> 13:26.537
How old are you?
Old enough to make a deal.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.922
These eyes don't lie.

13:27.924 --> 13:29.840
Something the other
night woke me up.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.292
Yeah, what time
was that, 7:00?

13:31.294 --> 13:33.327
Shut up, tool.
I look out the window.

13:33.329 --> 13:36.163
Girl that got in the car
never got out.

13:36.165 --> 13:37.715
Somebody in there with her?
Yeah.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.383
But I can't recall
what he looked like.

13:39.385 --> 13:42.019
Maybe Andrew Jackson
could help me remember.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.738
The guy that got
out of the car

14:00.740 --> 14:02.540
wore a white uniform jacket.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.857
Never saw his face.

14:03.859 --> 14:05.859
Joker took off
like a bat out of hell.

14:05.861 --> 14:07.027
What'd you say
your name was again?

14:07.029 --> 14:08.579
The streets have no name.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.880
But I have your number,

14:09.882 --> 14:11.248
remember?

14:12.718 --> 14:16.804
MAN: <i>Congressman McLane was</i>
<i>a visionary for the South.</i>

14:16.806 --> 14:19.390
He understood
how we cling to tradition

14:19.392 --> 14:22.093
but still welcome change.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.146
Dan had a bright future
ahead of him in politics.

14:25.148 --> 14:27.348
But he was
a terribly stubborn man.

14:27.350 --> 14:30.217
Especially when it came
to issues of personal security.

14:30.219 --> 14:31.268
He had bodyguards, right,

14:31.270 --> 14:32.737
Mr. Hanlon?

14:32.739 --> 14:34.772
Occasionally. (chuckles)

14:34.774 --> 14:38.693
He insisted he was
better trained than they were.

14:38.695 --> 14:41.562
But there was one fan
who made us all take notice.

14:41.564 --> 14:42.697
Emil Titus

14:42.699 --> 14:44.198
was his name.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.566
The one who CC'd you
on that letter.

14:45.568 --> 14:47.234
Did you report Emil Titus
to the police?

14:47.236 --> 14:48.369
Of course.

14:48.371 --> 14:50.004
You have to remember,

14:50.006 --> 14:51.672
my company has had its share

14:51.674 --> 14:53.374
of disgruntled workers
over the years.

14:53.376 --> 14:55.292
We employ
an entire security force,

14:55.294 --> 14:57.345
so I thought
we could handle it internally.

14:57.347 --> 14:59.547
Perhaps that
was a mistake.

14:59.549 --> 15:02.466
Do you have a mailing
address for Titus?

15:02.468 --> 15:03.851
There was none
on the letter.

15:03.853 --> 15:05.419
I kept files.

15:05.421 --> 15:07.221
They're in, uh,
boxes in the closet.

15:07.223 --> 15:08.723
You mind waiting?

15:08.725 --> 15:10.424
It's a nice family.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.479
We are the legacy
we leave behind, Agent DiNozzo.

15:18.316 --> 15:20.151
VANCE:
Anything, Doctor?

15:20.153 --> 15:21.569
Victor Lorta

15:21.571 --> 15:24.038
seemed to revel
in the spotlight.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.440
He answered every
correspondence personally,

15:26.442 --> 15:28.959
keeping a copy
for his own records.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.045
In each, he insisted

15:31.047 --> 15:34.048
without a shadow of a doubt
that he was innocent.

15:34.050 --> 15:35.049
Guy's a dirtbag.

15:35.051 --> 15:36.050
Even as a juvie,

15:36.052 --> 15:37.585
he had a rap sheet
that would have

15:37.587 --> 15:38.719
put him away no matter what.

15:38.721 --> 15:40.755
Yes, but what I find
so surprising

15:40.757 --> 15:43.090
is that in letter
after letter,

15:43.092 --> 15:46.310
he maintains that one man

15:46.312 --> 15:49.930
manipulated the evidence
that secured his guilt.

15:49.932 --> 15:52.817
Somebody that the Fed Five
didn't know about?

15:52.819 --> 15:54.435
No, on the contrary.

15:54.437 --> 15:56.070
The man he says

15:56.072 --> 16:00.991
framed him was
NIS Special Agent Dan McLane.

16:04.863 --> 16:06.497
Prove it.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.948
Oh, I can't.

16:07.950 --> 16:11.001
But it led me
to play devil's advocate.

16:11.003 --> 16:14.121
If murders are still
being committed today

16:14.123 --> 16:16.156
in the identical style,

16:16.158 --> 16:17.842
and Victor Lorta

16:17.844 --> 16:19.427
was telling the truth...

16:19.429 --> 16:22.663
The real Privileged killer
could still be out there.

16:37.088 --> 16:40.190
You're basing all this
on pen-pal letters?

16:40.192 --> 16:41.792
For 20 years,

16:41.794 --> 16:43.694
Victor Lorta maintained
the position that he was framed.

16:43.696 --> 16:46.113
Suddenly, new victims
are surfacing,

16:46.115 --> 16:47.681
killed in the identical manner.

16:47.683 --> 16:50.534
Now, you tell me
that it isn't possible.

16:50.536 --> 16:53.487
It isn't. There was a mountain
of forensic evidence

16:53.489 --> 16:55.872
that connected the murders
directly to Victor Lorta.

16:55.874 --> 16:58.208
Evidence that could
have been planted.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.193
Sir, you're talking
to the guys who were there,

17:00.195 --> 17:02.212
on the case,
at the time.

17:02.214 --> 17:05.299
Pride, you and Gibbs
were probies.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.000
Low men on the
totem pole.

17:07.002 --> 17:09.368
We're not suggesting
you were involved.

17:09.371 --> 17:11.255
Dan McLane was our boss.

17:11.257 --> 17:13.723
He was my friend.

17:13.726 --> 17:17.210
The best agent NIS ever had.

17:17.212 --> 17:18.679
Why would he do it?

17:18.681 --> 17:20.380
To gain what exactly?

17:20.382 --> 17:21.397
Gibbs, what do you think?

17:21.400 --> 17:22.683
Could McLane

17:22.685 --> 17:24.050
have crossed the line?

17:31.892 --> 17:34.077
Come on, brother.

17:36.414 --> 17:38.749
Really?

17:46.541 --> 17:48.208
(loud, overlapping
crowd chatter, whooping)

17:48.210 --> 17:50.210
Hey, Dwayne, hold up.

17:50.212 --> 17:52.512
Will you stop?
What happened back there, huh?

17:52.514 --> 17:54.131
You forget everything?

17:54.133 --> 17:56.249
I didn't forget anything.
Danny Mac's dead,

17:56.251 --> 17:59.936
and they're accusing him
of framing an innocent man.

17:59.938 --> 18:02.105
People are still dying.
It's a copycat, Gibbs.

18:02.107 --> 18:03.607
Is it?

18:03.609 --> 18:04.941
We were young.

18:04.943 --> 18:06.443
We didn't ask questions.

18:06.445 --> 18:08.762
Why the hell would he do it?
And what about Franks?

18:08.764 --> 18:10.731
Was he in on it, too?
Dwayne,

18:10.733 --> 18:13.116
people make mistakes.

18:13.118 --> 18:16.486
We should go talk
to Felix Betts.

18:16.488 --> 18:18.288
Agent Betts isn't the same.

18:18.290 --> 18:21.158
He was there, he saw it,
he saw things we didn't.

18:25.112 --> 18:28.615
TONY:
Oh! Aah!

18:28.617 --> 18:30.751
Ow! Wow!

18:30.753 --> 18:32.786
No living creature should
endure this much pain.

18:32.788 --> 18:34.471
Migraine, Tony?

18:34.473 --> 18:36.056
It just started happening.

18:36.058 --> 18:37.674
It was just like...

18:37.676 --> 18:40.293
It's just right there.

18:42.013 --> 18:43.563
Why is he back?

18:43.565 --> 18:44.598
I've got a stabbing

18:44.600 --> 18:45.932
pain in my skull, and...

18:45.934 --> 18:47.768
and he's back.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.321
He's got a needle in his head.

18:51.323 --> 18:53.139
I never took him
out of the trash.

18:53.141 --> 18:55.975
I was fine, and then this doll

18:55.977 --> 18:58.445
with a needle
in its head came back.

19:00.948 --> 19:02.532
It hurts.

19:02.534 --> 19:05.285
Special Agent DiNozzo,
we need some information.

19:05.287 --> 19:07.337
Moments from being
pain-free, sir.

19:11.992 --> 19:13.960
It's possible

19:13.962 --> 19:15.979
we may be looking
for the real Privileged killer.

19:15.981 --> 19:18.682
I'm sorry?
The man

19:18.684 --> 19:20.851
we arrested 20 years ago
wasn't the real killer?

19:20.853 --> 19:22.836
Questions later.

19:22.838 --> 19:25.889
McVoodoo, let's
show them what we have.

19:25.891 --> 19:29.359
Emil Titus, the grandson
of deceased Admiral Jonas Titus,

19:29.361 --> 19:30.977
was born and raised
in Mississippi.

19:30.979 --> 19:33.346
He eventually made his money
in commuter aviation.

19:33.348 --> 19:34.364
Fascinated by

19:34.366 --> 19:35.816
the Privileged case,

19:35.818 --> 19:37.317
he followed Lorta
and McLane for years.

19:37.319 --> 19:39.069
Reached out
to McLane in letters,

19:39.071 --> 19:40.821
insisting
that Lorta was innocent.

19:40.823 --> 19:42.789
Maybe he knew
Lorta was innocent.

19:42.791 --> 19:44.241
McGEE: Well, once McLane
became a congressman,

19:44.243 --> 19:45.659
Titus started making

19:45.661 --> 19:47.377
sizable donations
to his campaign.

19:47.379 --> 19:50.163
That's when his obsession
really flagged for Josef Hanlon.

19:50.165 --> 19:53.083
But no one ever questioned
Titus's curiosity.

19:53.085 --> 19:54.534
Until now.
TONY: Intel says

19:54.536 --> 19:56.536
he's been laying low

19:56.538 --> 19:57.871
at a house that he owns

19:57.873 --> 19:59.840
in New Orleans'
swanky Garden District.

19:59.842 --> 20:01.508
How old is Titus?
53.

20:01.510 --> 20:05.345
Old enough to have started
all is a long time ago.

20:12.403 --> 20:15.605
Thank you, ma'am.
We're good from here.

20:18.726 --> 20:20.727
Felix Betts.

20:20.729 --> 20:23.363
There's the ornery
old bastard.

20:23.365 --> 20:25.065
Look at him, Gibbs.

20:25.067 --> 20:29.119
Living the good life
in the Florida sunshine.

20:35.626 --> 20:36.910
(softly):
Hey.

20:40.348 --> 20:42.098
What time do
the strippers get here?

20:42.100 --> 20:43.416
After my nap.

20:43.418 --> 20:44.468
(laughs)
Otherwise,

20:44.470 --> 20:46.252
the lap dance is wasted.

20:46.254 --> 20:47.253
(chuckles)

20:47.255 --> 20:48.271
Yeah, I'm glad

20:48.273 --> 20:50.724
some things don't change.

20:53.761 --> 20:55.979
Let me look at you.

20:57.782 --> 21:00.567
You look like crap.

21:00.569 --> 21:02.152
Yeah, well, I been
working too hard.

21:02.154 --> 21:04.704
You need more zing
on the springs.

21:04.706 --> 21:08.158
So, which wife are you
up to these days?

21:08.160 --> 21:09.943
Oh, no, I'm-I'm on
my own now, Felix.

21:09.945 --> 21:11.545
It's better.

21:11.547 --> 21:13.446
Better for everybody.

21:15.416 --> 21:17.050
(chuckles)

21:17.052 --> 21:20.119
Hey, Betts, look at
this picture we found.

21:20.121 --> 21:22.956
Remember this?

21:22.958 --> 21:24.791
(exhales)

21:24.793 --> 21:26.125
Long time ago.

21:26.127 --> 21:28.311
Hey, where's Dan?

21:28.313 --> 21:32.015
How come the son of
a bitch didn't come?

21:36.103 --> 21:38.188
Sorry to tell you
this, brother.

21:39.941 --> 21:42.192
He's not with us anymore.

21:43.327 --> 21:46.145
Felix, play
a game with me.

21:46.147 --> 21:48.782
All right? Okay, I need you
to try real hard.

21:48.784 --> 21:49.983
Years ago,

21:49.985 --> 21:51.918
did you ever hear
of somebody

21:51.920 --> 21:56.322
framing Lorta...
as the Privileged killer?

22:02.930 --> 22:05.131
Mike Franks.

22:05.133 --> 22:08.852
Man, did he love you.

22:11.272 --> 22:15.174
Crazy bastard living
down in Mexico.

22:15.176 --> 22:16.843
All that booze

22:16.845 --> 22:18.361
and the broads.

22:18.363 --> 22:20.063
Felix...

22:20.065 --> 22:21.865
did Dan take a bribe...

22:21.867 --> 22:24.234
and frame Lorta

22:24.236 --> 22:25.869
for the murders?

22:34.962 --> 22:38.832
We did some good, didn't we?

22:43.888 --> 22:46.056
We got sandwiches inside.

22:46.058 --> 22:48.374
You guys hungry?

22:51.345 --> 22:56.182
Sandwiches sound real good...
Felix. Real...

22:56.184 --> 22:58.852
real good.

22:58.854 --> 23:01.888
(blues playing)

23:01.890 --> 23:03.723
Hobbs.

23:03.725 --> 23:07.861
Turn the godforsaken music off
so we can have a conversation.

23:07.863 --> 23:11.197
That music, my beloved,
is anything but godforsaken.

23:12.566 --> 23:14.250
(turns music off)
Better?

23:14.252 --> 23:15.952
Your beloved thanks you.

23:15.954 --> 23:17.420
I matched the nick
in the victim's vertebrae

23:17.422 --> 23:18.421
to a steel blade.

23:18.423 --> 23:20.073
Probably an antique.

23:20.075 --> 23:21.708
Also, there are
trace elements of fuel

23:21.710 --> 23:23.677
found in the tire tracks
in the wetlands--

23:23.679 --> 23:27.080
something called... ASTMD910.

23:27.082 --> 23:30.016
That's aviation jet fuel.

23:30.018 --> 23:31.418
Can I turn my music back on now?

23:31.420 --> 23:32.919
Not if you want to see tomorrow.

23:32.921 --> 23:34.187
LaSALLE:
There were traces of jet fuel

23:34.189 --> 23:35.221
in Doyle's car, too.

23:35.223 --> 23:36.790
This is all pointing
to Emil Titus.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.525
We'll need a warrant. Thanks.

23:38.527 --> 23:40.644
I'll wake up Judge Mavis.
BRODY: I'll call Pride.

23:40.646 --> 23:42.261
Thanks, Doc.

23:49.403 --> 23:51.237
Been practicing, Bishop?

23:52.289 --> 23:54.074
Brody.

23:54.076 --> 23:55.441
I need a minute before we go.

23:55.443 --> 23:57.827
Yes, sir?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.417
Why didn't you say something?

24:04.419 --> 24:06.670
Say what, exactly?

24:06.672 --> 24:08.121
I saw the bomber
on board

24:08.123 --> 24:09.889
the U.S.S. <i>Moultrie</i>
and I froze?

24:09.891 --> 24:11.307
PRIDE:
Well, maybe. Sure.

24:11.309 --> 24:13.009
BRODY:
Hi. I'm Special Agent Brody

24:13.011 --> 24:14.394
from the Great Lakes Office.

24:14.396 --> 24:15.595
You might want to
watch your back.

24:15.597 --> 24:17.397
My reaction time can
be unpredictable.

24:17.399 --> 24:19.733
Now, see, that's not what I...
I drew my gun, sir.

24:19.735 --> 24:22.235
He hit the button first.

24:22.237 --> 24:24.487
Like <i>Jeopardy?</i>

24:24.489 --> 24:25.972
What?

24:25.974 --> 24:28.158
The game show.
Believe what you want,

24:28.160 --> 24:30.977
but some folks say the buzzers
don't work right away.

24:30.979 --> 24:34.814
Alex Trebek gives
the answer; we see them

24:34.816 --> 24:38.418
pushing their buttons
crazy fast-- nothing.

24:38.420 --> 24:42.288
Doesn't mean they
didn't have the right question.

24:44.008 --> 24:46.659
Some folks just have
better buttons.

24:47.661 --> 24:48.995
I don't care

24:48.997 --> 24:52.098
about what was, Brody;
I care about what is.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.717
You good now?

24:53.719 --> 24:55.685
Very.
All right, then.

24:55.687 --> 24:56.669
Let's do this.

24:56.671 --> 24:58.805
Chris.
Yeah, King?

24:58.807 --> 25:01.107
I need you
to unlock Charmaine.

25:01.109 --> 25:02.192
You got it.

25:02.194 --> 25:03.560
Thought you two broke up.

25:03.562 --> 25:06.062
Been my mistress 25 years--
can't split up now.

25:06.064 --> 25:07.397
Who's Charmaine?

25:07.399 --> 25:09.315
Sweet, sweet Charmaine.

25:10.684 --> 25:12.986
(Pride sighs)

25:14.038 --> 25:15.989
Come here, baby.

25:18.025 --> 25:19.325
(phone ringing)

25:19.327 --> 25:21.360
Good thing you can't talk.

25:21.362 --> 25:22.996
Stories you'd tell.

25:22.998 --> 25:24.631
Yeah, Abbs, what do you got?

25:24.633 --> 25:25.715
Bonjour, Gibbs.

25:25.717 --> 25:27.217
The jet fuel

25:27.219 --> 25:29.969
that was on FBI Agent Doyle's
floor mats

25:29.971 --> 25:33.039
is identical
to what you found in the mud.

25:33.041 --> 25:35.842
Emil Titus has got
to be your guy, Gibbs.

25:35.844 --> 25:37.343
All right. Thanks, Abbs.

25:51.942 --> 25:53.526
NCIS!

25:53.528 --> 25:54.894
LaSALLE:
Federal agents!

26:10.761 --> 26:12.095
It's clear, King.

26:12.097 --> 26:14.214
Clear.

26:20.771 --> 26:22.105
In here.

26:39.290 --> 26:41.574
Call the morgue.

26:55.085 --> 26:57.369
Anything, Doc?
Small-caliber wound.

26:57.371 --> 26:59.922
Close range.
Meant to look self-inflicted.

26:59.924 --> 27:01.206
Meant to?
Yeah.

27:01.208 --> 27:02.508
I think somebody staged this.

27:02.510 --> 27:04.660
Titus must have been
holding a gun.

27:04.662 --> 27:06.478
WADE: As far as I
can tell, there's no

27:06.480 --> 27:07.780
gunpowder residue
on his hands.

27:07.782 --> 27:09.148
Adios.

27:09.150 --> 27:12.067
PRIDE: If that's true,
it had to be someone he knew,

27:12.069 --> 27:13.519
someone he let get close.

27:13.521 --> 27:15.237
Someone he trusted.

27:15.239 --> 27:16.388
Gibbs, there were no witnesses;

27:16.390 --> 27:17.773
neighbors didn't hear
or see anything.

27:17.775 --> 27:19.858
It's a dead end.
He's playing us again.

27:19.860 --> 27:21.944
Just like he played us
standing outside the market.

27:21.946 --> 27:24.697
First that hooker, then the lobbyist.
Now this.

27:24.699 --> 27:25.864
It's a game to him, Gibbs.

27:25.866 --> 27:27.916
Only problem is,

27:27.918 --> 27:29.702
I don't like to lose.

27:31.254 --> 27:33.872
TONY:
McGee, it's all a scam.

27:33.874 --> 27:36.508
Titus, the fibers
under the fingernails.

27:36.510 --> 27:38.510
I'm telling you,
this guy's good.

27:38.512 --> 27:40.179
The real killer
knew Emil Titus wore

27:40.181 --> 27:43.215
his grandfather's old
Navy jacket, so the killer...

27:43.217 --> 27:45.917
wore the jacket
to Doyle's crime scene.

27:45.919 --> 27:47.686
It's all bait.

27:47.688 --> 27:50.756
Chum to send us
into a clue-feeding frenzy.

27:50.758 --> 27:53.025
Oh, God, please not another
<i>Jaws</i> metaphor.

27:53.027 --> 27:55.277
Don't start speaking
like Quint again.

27:55.279 --> 27:56.595
"We'll put three barrels on him.

27:56.597 --> 27:57.863
"He can't stay down

27:57.865 --> 28:00.949
with three barrels on him!"

28:00.951 --> 28:02.284
Navy jacket
was a ruse.

28:02.286 --> 28:03.369
More planted evidence

28:03.371 --> 28:04.603
to make Emil Titus look guilty.

28:04.605 --> 28:06.155
For all we know,
the killer's probably

28:06.157 --> 28:09.074
targeting McLane's
fund-raising buddy, Hanlon, too.

28:09.076 --> 28:10.609
You better get over there,

28:10.611 --> 28:13.128
fill him in.
Well, why do I have to go?

28:13.130 --> 28:15.247
I'm incapacitated.

28:19.302 --> 28:21.420
(sighs)

28:21.422 --> 28:22.588
All right, listen up.

28:22.590 --> 28:24.256
You're looking
for major deposits

28:24.258 --> 28:27.393
in new accounts established
by McLane in the early '90s.

28:27.395 --> 28:29.961
(tapping keyboard) Hang on.
I've got a problem here.

28:29.963 --> 28:31.313
Oh.

28:35.852 --> 28:37.969
Sorry. LEGO bricks.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.992
Got something.
Put it on the plasma.

28:43.994 --> 28:47.329
BISHOP: McLane deposited $500,000
to a bank in the Caymans.

28:47.331 --> 28:49.231
BRODY: He also deposited
another $250,000

28:49.233 --> 28:51.083
spread between multiple banks
in multiple states.

28:51.085 --> 28:53.202
Not exactly a
government pension.

28:53.204 --> 28:55.487
You want to tell
Gibbs and Pride, or should I?

29:12.672 --> 29:14.306
Pretty, huh?

29:15.141 --> 29:17.643
I had no idea.

29:19.145 --> 29:22.981
There are things you trust
when you... live in Louisiana.

29:25.235 --> 29:27.703
Trust the river will rise;
people will rise to the occasion

29:27.705 --> 29:29.238
no matter what the challenge.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.623
Trust the rain will
never stop pouring,

29:31.625 --> 29:33.709
the drinks will never
stop flowing, and...

29:33.711 --> 29:37.663
(chuckles softly)
music will never stop playing.

29:37.665 --> 29:39.798
And after all the hell you
go through living here,

29:39.800 --> 29:42.367
you trust in God Almighty,
and you trust in friends

29:42.369 --> 29:43.552
and family.

29:43.554 --> 29:46.638
All those years...

29:46.640 --> 29:50.709
a man I called my brother
was living a lie, and I...

29:50.711 --> 29:53.679
I took it...

29:53.681 --> 29:55.898
hook, line and sinker.

29:55.900 --> 29:57.433
You know the truth now.

29:57.435 --> 29:59.101
The man was nothing but a fraud.

29:59.103 --> 30:01.437
Mac was still a
good agent, King.

30:01.439 --> 30:03.572
Just made a mistake,

30:03.574 --> 30:05.657
and he suffered for it.

30:05.659 --> 30:07.559
I know that the bond

30:07.561 --> 30:11.062
we had back then was real.

30:11.064 --> 30:13.615
It's real now, too.

30:15.118 --> 30:18.253
If Privileged
is still out there...

30:20.406 --> 30:22.541
...we have a job to do.

30:25.879 --> 30:28.847
20 years ago,
NIS Agent McLane took a bribe.

30:28.849 --> 30:30.883
Probably from the real
Privileged killer

30:30.885 --> 30:33.268
to frame a man for a crime
he didn't commit.

30:33.270 --> 30:34.603
Why?

30:34.605 --> 30:35.938
Well, according
to McLane's wife,

30:35.940 --> 30:37.523
his mother's health
was failing,

30:37.525 --> 30:39.274
and his daughter
had been diagnosed

30:39.276 --> 30:40.392
with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

30:40.394 --> 30:41.693
McLane must have been desperate,

30:41.695 --> 30:43.529
and on a government
agent's salary.

30:43.531 --> 30:45.814
Mac's wife, Amy,
put blinders on,

30:45.816 --> 30:47.316
never questioned any of it.

30:47.318 --> 30:49.701
FORNELL: But with reelection
on the horizon,

30:49.703 --> 30:51.119
your friend couldn't live
the lie anymore

30:51.121 --> 30:52.571
and wanted to come clean.

30:52.573 --> 30:54.790
McLane finally said
enough is enough.

30:54.792 --> 30:56.775
Scared the killer
into keeping him quiet.

30:56.777 --> 30:58.460
So clearly some
of Mac's campaign donations

30:58.462 --> 30:59.828
were hush money.

30:59.830 --> 31:02.047
Cash to turn a blind eye.

31:02.049 --> 31:04.500
DiNozzo, over the years,

31:04.502 --> 31:07.469
McLane's largest contributor?
Josef Hanlon.

31:07.471 --> 31:08.971
But Hanlon's been in DC
the whole time.

31:08.973 --> 31:10.138
TONY:
Hanlon has a son,

31:10.140 --> 31:11.807
Spencer, runs everything now.

31:11.809 --> 31:14.292
They got factories up and down
the East Coast,

31:14.294 --> 31:15.961
including New Orleans.

31:15.963 --> 31:17.813
Yeah, and I bet he's got
a company jet.

31:17.815 --> 31:19.648
Explains the fuel.

31:19.650 --> 31:20.816
VANCE:
Agent DiNozzo,

31:20.818 --> 31:22.251
where's Agent McGee?

31:24.654 --> 31:26.438
McGEE:
<i>Whoever's doing this</i>

31:26.440 --> 31:28.490
had been following McLane
for years.

31:28.492 --> 31:30.409
We think that they paid him off,
and in exchange,

31:30.411 --> 31:32.644
he framed Lorta for crimes
he didn't commit.

31:32.646 --> 31:34.079
Extraordinary.

31:34.081 --> 31:37.165
And difficult for me
to comprehend.

31:37.167 --> 31:39.368
For your protection,
we're gonna need to search

31:39.370 --> 31:41.620
through all of McLane's
fund-raising records,

31:41.622 --> 31:43.589
uh, guests at receptions,
all of it.

31:43.591 --> 31:46.375
I may have some old names
packed away from years ago.

31:46.377 --> 31:47.659
Great, that would be
very helpful.

31:47.661 --> 31:49.011
See what I can find.

31:49.013 --> 31:50.429
Please, Agent McGee, uh,

31:50.431 --> 31:51.713
make yourself comfortable.

31:51.715 --> 31:53.549
Thanks.

32:04.811 --> 32:08.030
Mr. Hanlon, you still do
a lot of traveling for work?

32:08.032 --> 32:10.866
None. My son, Spencer,

32:10.868 --> 32:13.535
handles most of the
factory supervision now.

32:15.572 --> 32:17.072
Where are they located?

32:17.074 --> 32:18.490
Oh, Georgia.

32:19.409 --> 32:21.493
Florida.

32:22.712 --> 32:24.696
And, uh, Louisiana.

32:26.049 --> 32:28.166
Mr. Hanlon?

32:45.362 --> 32:47.129
TONY: Boss, we're on our way
to Hanlon's.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.799
The old man's been making
campaign contributions

32:49.801 --> 32:52.418
to McLane all these years
as payola to protect his son.

32:52.420 --> 32:54.003
Son is textbook, Gibbs.

32:54.005 --> 32:55.554
Trouble in school
when he was a kid.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.673
He wanted to be a Marine,
but he got declined.

32:57.675 --> 32:59.925
Divorced, travels all the time,
keeps to himself.

32:59.927 --> 33:03.062
Are you sure
this is Privileged?

33:03.064 --> 33:04.847
Privileged is
the Hanlon family secret.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.515
Your friend, Dan,
just wanted to come clean.

33:06.517 --> 33:08.484
Telling the truth
got him killed.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.401
DiNozzo,

33:09.403 --> 33:10.519
Josef's son, Spencer,

33:10.521 --> 33:12.188
where is he right now?

33:12.190 --> 33:14.389
We think New Orleans, but
we can't find an address.

33:14.391 --> 33:16.158
Get to McGee. Come on.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.410
Spencer Hanlon,
find him. Let's go.

33:20.197 --> 33:22.114
Well, he's not in any hotels.

33:22.116 --> 33:23.699
BISHOP: No apartments,
houses or boat rentals.

33:23.701 --> 33:25.751
Trying corporate accounts,
Hanlon Digital,

33:25.753 --> 33:26.919
business credit card statements.

33:26.921 --> 33:29.121
Got one. Hanlon's been
using a car service

33:29.123 --> 33:31.040
from New Orleans Lakefront
Airport to a building

33:31.042 --> 33:32.041
off the French Market.

33:32.043 --> 33:33.542
The Hanlon jet is in town,

33:33.544 --> 33:34.910
fueled and waiting to depart.

33:34.912 --> 33:36.078
Ground it.
Put Homeland in front

33:36.080 --> 33:37.412
of the wheels if you have to.

33:37.414 --> 33:40.249
Get the hell out of here.
Let's go.

33:40.251 --> 33:42.084
Federal agents!

33:45.138 --> 33:47.556
(McGee groaning quietly)

33:47.558 --> 33:49.391
McGee.

33:50.393 --> 33:51.426
McGee.

33:51.428 --> 33:53.112
Ow, that's a big bump.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.230
DiNozzo,

33:54.232 --> 33:55.447
bathroom.

34:07.911 --> 34:09.795
He called his son.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.463
Spencer knows.

34:12.716 --> 34:14.917
NCIS!

34:37.440 --> 34:39.440
LaSALLE:
Place is empty, King.

34:39.443 --> 34:41.327
He's gone.
Split up. Get a BOLO out.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.279
Call FBI and NOPD for backup.

34:43.281 --> 34:45.781
Manager says his car's parked
in the garage.

34:45.783 --> 34:47.815
Check the tires;
match them to the wetlands.

34:47.818 --> 34:50.953
He's on foot.

34:50.955 --> 34:53.789
Displays his victims
like family.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.489
BRODY:
He knows we're close.

34:55.492 --> 34:57.626
If he spoke to his
father, he's scared.

34:57.628 --> 34:58.994
Chances are he'll kill again.

34:58.996 --> 35:01.163

He's with a girl,

You know,

37:58.109 --> 37:59.808
I hope you don't mind.

37:59.810 --> 38:02.111
I just asked the director
to skip protocol

38:02.113 --> 38:04.446
and extend your visit
to New Orleans...

38:04.448 --> 38:06.231
indefinitely.

38:07.984 --> 38:09.151
You good with that?

38:11.454 --> 38:12.955
Mmm...

38:12.957 --> 38:14.406
Yes, but I have
one request.

38:14.408 --> 38:16.458
(chuckles)
Okay.

38:16.460 --> 38:17.859
Go for it.

38:17.861 --> 38:19.912
I need my own LEGO sculpture.

Give it up.

38:36.546 --> 38:37.712

That was a hell of a lunch.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.199
Yeah, well,
you'll be tasting it for days.

38:57.201 --> 38:58.750
Company wasn't
too bad, either.

38:58.752 --> 39:00.335

39:00.337 --> 39:02.254
Our plane is about to leave.

39:09.846 --> 39:11.096
But...

39:11.098 --> 39:14.299
today's not too shabby, either.
