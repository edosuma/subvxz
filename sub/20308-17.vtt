WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:04.004
(people chattering)

00:07.757 --> 00:09.509
-Captain.
-Morning. Where's Parker?

00:09.592 --> 00:10.635
Interrogation A.

00:11.469 --> 00:12.679
Thanks for waiting.

00:12.762 --> 00:14.431
Saw on the intake
he was day shift till last week.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.849
So I figured I'd give you a call.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.350
FRANK: How is the man he shot?

00:17.434 --> 00:19.102
Probable paralysis below the waist.

00:21.604 --> 00:22.522
Captain.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.567
-FRANK: You okay, Ted?
-I guess.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.110
I hope.

00:29.821 --> 00:30.655
Item six.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.324
uh, in the vicinity of the old
Club San Juan this morning,

00:33.408 --> 00:34.784
some of you may know,

00:35.201 --> 00:39.247
uh, patrolman Ted Parker shot
and wounded one Rafael Gonzalez,

00:39.330 --> 00:40.749
an armed robbery suspect.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.501
The actual perp
was apprehended an hour later.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.754
-Hope Parker's got some marketable skills.
-LUCY: Hey, Sarge.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.922
I heard the guy
was reaching for a gun, so--

00:48.006 --> 00:50.383
Please, everybody,
no speculation until, uh--

00:50.467 --> 00:53.219
until the investigation
is completed, all right?

00:53.303 --> 00:57.015
And let's-let's show some special
restraint in the barrio.

00:57.098 --> 01:00.310
Item seven.
At today's award ceremony downtown,

01:00.393 --> 01:03.146
Officer Jack Metcalf,
who was killed in the line of duty,

01:03.229 --> 01:06.608
will receive this city's
medal of valor posthumously.

01:06.691 --> 01:07.942
His widow will be accepting.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.110
Item eight.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.696
-The "Sutton Street Slasher" struck again.
-(all groan)

01:11.780 --> 01:15.408
Two more prostitutes last night,
one dead, one critical at Mercy.

01:15.492 --> 01:19.829
Uh, the current thinking
is that this is a new pimp

01:19.913 --> 01:24.626
who is trying to colonize
the trade above 92nd Street.

01:24.709 --> 01:28.797
So Officer Russo
will be working undercover.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.633
Sergeant Bates, Officer Flaherty,
you'll be doing backup.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.761
Item last. We're looking
for the killer of Carl Mann,

01:34.844 --> 01:37.180
the late, unlamented leader of the Blood,

01:37.263 --> 01:39.390
the gang that was responsible
for the massacre

01:39.474 --> 01:41.726
of the innocent Burnett family.

01:41.810 --> 01:46.523
He was shot last night
in front of the gang headquarters.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.901
Wanted for questioning, Alfred Williams.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.904
He was a gang member
turned police informant

01:52.987 --> 01:54.155
who's known to some of you.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.615
Black, 18, average height.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.576
You can acquaint yourself with his picture
on the board on the way out.

01:58.660 --> 02:02.455
And, people, Williams is probably armed,

02:02.539 --> 02:05.667
so, uh... take care.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.002
-Dismissed.
-(chairs scrape)

02:08.086 --> 02:10.296
I always liked Parker.
Hope they don't hang this on him.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.424
What's new? They use you up,
then they throw you away.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.009
-What's bugging you?
-Nothing, man.

02:15.093 --> 02:18.054
You think you could break down one time
and buy your own breakfast?

02:19.597 --> 02:21.599
Tina? Russo.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.144
So we gonna catch a movie tonight?

02:24.227 --> 02:27.147
Patrick, I'm just not feeling
very social right now, okay?

02:27.230 --> 02:28.148
Well, let me figure this.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.858
Sleeping together is okay,

02:29.941 --> 02:31.985
but we wouldn't want it to lead
to anything heavy,

02:32.068 --> 02:36.531
like, uh, eating popcorn together
in the balcony.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.994
Can we talk about this later?

02:44.706 --> 02:49.169
Hey, man, check this out,
size-50 slacks.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.588
That's hip... if you're a hippopotamus.

02:51.671 --> 02:56.009
You ripped off these pants.
Ain't my problem they don't fit.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.636
Aw, man, cut me some slack, Jack.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.805
Slack. Get it?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.390
Sit!

03:09.189 --> 03:11.733
-First name.
-Euripides.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.072
Last name.

03:18.907 --> 03:19.741
Pants.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.827
You rip-a these pants?

03:22.911 --> 03:25.079
-(laughs)
-(growls)

03:27.373 --> 03:29.083
-Come with me!
-Okay, okay.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.544
I was this close, Neal, this close.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.546
If her brother hadn't
shown up from Minneapolis...

03:33.630 --> 03:35.423
(girls yelling)

03:35.506 --> 03:36.507
J.D.: Pinch me, Neal.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.425
Pinch me hard.

03:37.508 --> 03:39.928
Uh, over here! Girls. Detective. Here.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.764
-Oh, detective!
-Help us!

03:42.847 --> 03:45.683
One more lousy joke,
I'm gonna rip-a your head off.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.770
-(girls clamoring)
-Calm down and tell J.D. what happened.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.271
(squeals)

03:51.022 --> 03:53.858
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:53.942 --> 03:55.944
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:56.027 --> 03:59.781
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:59.864 --> 04:01.199
(sirens wailing)

04:06.996 --> 04:09.958
(theme music playing)

05:56.189 --> 05:57.982
MAN: So you and your partner
answered the call.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.402
Dispatch says the suspect's
wearing a blue ski jacket,

06:01.486 --> 06:04.155
white high-tops, armed with a revolver.

06:04.405 --> 06:05.907
-(door opens, closes)
-About three blocks from the scene,

06:05.990 --> 06:10.036
I spot this guy, Gonzalez,
walking fast, like he's in a hurry.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.497
Dark ski jacket, white shoes.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.456
High-tops?

06:13.706 --> 06:16.834
-They were white. That's all I saw.
-Go on.

06:17.835 --> 06:20.213
We pull over, we draw our guns.

06:20.296 --> 06:23.091
Stay behind the car doors,
you know, standard.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.425
I yell, "Police! Freeze."

06:24.509 --> 06:26.344
-In English?
-The first time.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.972
The guy backs against the wall
and starts rapping in Spanish.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.475
So I yell, <i>"Alto. Uh, manos arriba."</i>

06:33.017 --> 06:35.895
But now he's turning away,
reaching inside his jacket.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.605
I thought he was going for a gun...

06:38.815 --> 06:40.024
So I fired my weapon.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.734
Did it occur to you
that maybe he was walking fast

06:41.818 --> 06:43.111
because it was two below last night?

06:43.778 --> 06:44.946
He fit the description.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.740
Speak Spanish, Officer Parker?

06:47.824 --> 06:50.326
I completed the academy
"Street Spanish" course.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.663
And I can use the commands
on the department's translation card.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.039
But you don't understand the language?

06:55.123 --> 06:57.750
<i>Mi casa, su casa,</i> couple other things.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.502
You've had no follow-up
instruction here on the Hill?

06:59.585 --> 07:03.047
We haven't had Spanish classes
since Ray Calletano left the precinct.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.133
MAN: Want to know
what Gonzalez said, Officer?

07:05.216 --> 07:06.050
(paper rustles)

07:06.134 --> 07:08.010
Got this from a witness across the street.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.097
"I am legal.

07:12.473 --> 07:13.349
I will show you.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.810
I have a green card."

07:18.146 --> 07:19.772
I'll get his partner at his home.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.274
Then we've got some more
potential witnesses.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.776
Not to push,
but this one's rough on the community.

07:24.485 --> 07:27.280
Can't imagine why.
<i>Mi casa, su casa</i> is real impressive.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.241
My impression's been
that Parker's a B-plus cop.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.452
Call you when I have something, Captain.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.663
GIRL: This all happened so fast.
There was this humongous explosion--

07:35.746 --> 07:38.708
It's lucky for us it happened
a couple blocks from the station,

07:38.791 --> 07:40.209
and that I happened to be here.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.294
Now, this phone number,

07:41.377 --> 07:44.464
is this your parents'
or your own private number, Cheryl?

07:44.839 --> 07:46.048
My own private number.

07:46.132 --> 07:50.595
Okay. Um, Debbie St. Pierre.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.097
<i>Bienvenidas,</i> Debbie. How's that cut?

07:53.181 --> 07:54.599
WOMAN: Detective?

07:54.682 --> 07:55.850
Detective?

07:55.933 --> 07:58.144
You said that patrolmen
are searching the area.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.270
Can't we go?

07:59.353 --> 08:01.272
We've got a regional tournament to get to.

08:01.355 --> 08:05.234
Ma'am, you caught a round of ammunition
through the rear window of your van.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.321
An incident of this nature
requires we ask a few questions.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.114
But no one saw anything.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.992
The mind can play tricks
in extreme situations.

08:13.075 --> 08:16.120
I need each individual account in detail.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.080
Cheryl, you come this way.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.416
NEAL: Yo, J.D.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.127
Uh, go into interrogation, honey.
I'll be right there.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.755
Uh, this is the driver.
He didn't see anything, either.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.131
-Mm.
-I'm shot at.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.467
I park in front of your station.
I get a ticket.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.303
It's what I deserve
for taking a shortcut through the Hill.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.679
Hey, lookie here, babe.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.891
We can't keep these people here.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.352
Neal, there's a sniper out there,

08:39.435 --> 08:42.480
maybe with a dangerous thing
for young girls.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.609
It's a theory, right?
And I, for one, am concerned.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.904
Sixteen will get you 20, sport.

08:53.074 --> 08:56.202
-HOWARD: A clown beneath your window.
-A mechanical clown.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.870
It's a burger stand, Clown Burger.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.997
And he's singing this damn
Clown Burger song all day.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.333
What would you have us do, sir?
Arrest a mechanical clown?

09:02.416 --> 09:04.460
-Sergeant.
-If the owner has a permit--

09:04.544 --> 09:06.254
Hey, listen. I'm a musician, man.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.047
I work at night. I need my sleep.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.758
HOWARD:
Why don't you use cotton in your ears?

09:11.634 --> 09:12.760
Lieutenant Buntz?

09:13.135 --> 09:14.929
Uh, straight back, just keep walking.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.056
LUCY: Kate, how you doing?

09:17.139 --> 09:18.558
Back in the bag, back on the beat.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.935
That's where the fun is, huh?
Will you call me please? I gotta run.

09:21.018 --> 09:21.978
Yeah.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.189
Frank, want to catch me up
on the Gonzalez shooting

09:25.273 --> 09:27.525
-before the reporters arrive?
-I'll handle the press on this one, Henry.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.027
Any particular reason?

09:30.111 --> 09:32.280
I've been on the case for an hour.
It's just simpler.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.116
And something else, Frank.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.451
Alfred Williams.
I want to be there when he's found.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.452
No objections.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.999
(telephone ringing)

09:43.082 --> 09:46.502
Yes, I understand,
but you have got to swear out--

09:46.586 --> 09:49.463
-That's right. Have a nice day.
-(telephone thuds)

09:50.214 --> 09:53.384
-Hey, Kate! How's it going?
-Fine.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.428
-You brighten up my day, you know?
-(telephone ringing)

09:55.511 --> 09:58.055
Got a lot of police work.
It's good to see you.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.348
Buntz.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.517
No, he's not here.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.686
All right, I'll tell him you called. Yeah.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.689
Lot of trivia all the time.
And they got you back on patrol.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.648
That's good.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.943
So, uh, what brings
you back down here today?

10:11.027 --> 10:13.321
-Oh, visiting.
-Uh-huh.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.572
I just wonder--

10:14.655 --> 10:15.740
Listen, you got time
to catch a burger, huh?

10:15.823 --> 10:17.408
-You got a half hour?
-No.

10:17.491 --> 10:18.451
No? Too bad.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.203
What I wanted to know was, if, uh...

10:21.287 --> 10:23.664
you had this afternoon,
if, say, around 3:00--

10:23.748 --> 10:24.832
Listen, we'll do it now.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.084
Uh, what do you got,
a professional problem?

10:27.168 --> 10:29.837
No, no, I just have this thing
that I have to do this afternoon--

10:29.920 --> 10:31.047
I'm all jammed up.

10:31.130 --> 10:34.008
See, this afternoon
I got this thing I got to go to.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.092
Well, all right.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.219
-It's nothing serious, huh?
-No! Not at all.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.430
-All right. You'll catch me later, huh?
-Yeah, sure.

10:39.513 --> 10:43.601
Listen, I would, babe...
except... (sighs)

10:43.684 --> 10:45.561
You know what I got to do this afternoon?

10:46.020 --> 10:50.483
I have got to go downtown
to the awards and promotion ceremonies

10:50.566 --> 10:53.277
to see you get your freakin' medal!

10:53.361 --> 10:55.821
Hey, do you know what this broad did, huh?

10:55.905 --> 10:59.992
Do you know that they are giving her
the ribbon for bravery, first class?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.078
-Hey, what's the matter?
-(applause)

11:02.161 --> 11:04.372
Don't you people read the circulars, huh?

11:04.455 --> 11:06.040
Are you aware of the phrase

11:06.123 --> 11:08.793
"in the highest tradition
of the department?"

11:08.876 --> 11:10.294
That is what I am gonna do.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.797
I'm going to watch you
get your medal this afternoon.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.507
And what are you gonna do, huh?

11:14.590 --> 11:19.720
Hey, my pal, ladies and gentlemen,
Kate McBride, a hell of a cop.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.098
Hey, learn something.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.474
(laughs)

11:23.557 --> 11:24.767
All right!

11:24.850 --> 11:27.228
(cheering, applauding)

11:31.023 --> 11:32.441
-(tires screech)
-Watch it!

11:32.525 --> 11:34.193
Creeps! The world's full of 'em.

11:34.276 --> 11:37.279
-What is eating you?
-Doofuses and creeps, take your pick.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.949
Okay, okay.
If you don't want to talk it--

11:40.032 --> 11:41.158
Daryl Ann.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.494
Ever since she started selling cookies
at Mineldi's Market,

11:43.577 --> 11:44.662
she's been a changed woman.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.081
-All she can think about is her business.
-Wait a minute.

11:47.164 --> 11:51.168
Aren't you the guy who encouraged her
to try to market her own cookies,

11:51.252 --> 11:53.713
and now she's out making money on her own.
You're just jealous.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.048
Wrong, wrong, wrong, Dr. Freud!

11:56.132 --> 11:57.883
She's not on her own.
There's a man involved.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.177
-(chuckles) A man?
-A man!

12:00.261 --> 12:02.805
A guy named Ellis,
big, slick financial type.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.224
He wants to help finance
her cookie business.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.268
I knew we'd get to the bad parts, Andy.

12:07.351 --> 12:10.521
Only reason that I have been
going to night school,

12:10.604 --> 12:11.981
taking courses in business,

12:12.064 --> 12:15.526
is so that I could be the financial
advisor behind her rise to success.

12:15.609 --> 12:20.239
Then why don't you let this Ellis guy,
who wants to help you, make him a partner?

12:20.322 --> 12:21.657
(scoffs) Partners?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.576
Daryl Ann and I are supposed
to be partners.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.785
Partners for life, remember?

12:24.869 --> 12:27.163
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Attention, all units, 131 and Dekker,</i>

12:27.246 --> 12:28.622
<i>assault with club in progress.</i>

12:28.706 --> 12:31.083
Twenty-two-oh-two in response.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.043
-Oh, man, go on.
-(police siren wailing)

12:33.127 --> 12:35.546
♪ <i>I'll make your day...</i> ♪

12:35.629 --> 12:37.131
Here's one for Hank.

12:37.214 --> 12:40.718
-I'm warning you, Crumley!
-(police siren wails)

12:40.801 --> 12:42.303
I told you I'd call the police!

12:42.386 --> 12:44.638
Hold it! Police!

12:44.722 --> 12:46.891
Don't you hit that clown again!

12:46.974 --> 12:48.184
Don't hit it. You hear me? I mean it.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.602
-Give me that.
-(circus music playing)

12:49.685 --> 12:51.562
You try living with that noise
underneath your window!

12:52.980 --> 12:56.609
Oh, Ronnie, what that crazy man do to you?

12:57.151 --> 12:58.486
This will cost you money to fix!

12:58.569 --> 13:00.321
Hey, man, y'all guys,
you don't know what it's like

13:00.404 --> 13:02.990
having to listen to burgers and fries
in your damn sleep!

13:03.073 --> 13:04.909
Sir, do you have a permit
to play this music?

13:04.992 --> 13:06.243
Yeah! You want to see it?

13:07.244 --> 13:10.122
You damaged this man's property.
He could press charges against you.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.875
Oh, man, you go ahead, man.
You throw me in the joint.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.627
At least I don't have to listen
to no singing clown!

13:14.710 --> 13:17.296
You want to press charges on this guy?

13:17.379 --> 13:21.133
-Nah! But I want the clown paid for.
-Well, then, just--

13:21.217 --> 13:23.844
-I gotta pay--
-Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

13:23.928 --> 13:26.514
You have no choice. Now get on.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.852
You turn down this sound. You understand?

13:32.228 --> 13:34.230
Have some consideration
for your neighbors.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.023
Let's go! Move it!

13:36.357 --> 13:38.526
-Margaret, can we get a refill here?
-MARGARET: Yeah.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.237
We're running a little late, all right?

13:41.320 --> 13:43.405
The girls don't start
working that street before 10:00.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.867
Sarge, we of the younger generation
are gonna teach you how to relax.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.077
Give me a break.

13:48.953 --> 13:52.456
You want to see my imitation
of bacon frying in a pan?

13:52.706 --> 13:54.959
TINA: I have learned to ignore him.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.798
Ah-ah! Youngsters like you
should save your pennies.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.511
You know I didn't mean nothing.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.597
Be right back.

14:14.645 --> 14:15.604
(gasps)

14:15.688 --> 14:17.398
-Look. About the movie tonight?
-Mm-hmm.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.357
I think you're right.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.900
-You do?
-Mm-hmm.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.068
I can understand,

14:21.151 --> 14:24.154
I mean, how you wouldn't want to go public
with our great romance.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.865
You just can't quit, can you?

14:25.948 --> 14:26.782
On the other hand,

14:26.866 --> 14:30.661
if I just happened to show up
at the Van Buren Theater, say, about 8:00,

14:30.744 --> 14:34.123
and you just happened to be there, too,
completely by coincidence,

14:34.206 --> 14:38.002
what's wrong with a couple professionals
seeing a movie together, huh?

14:38.210 --> 14:41.338
Tell me... what's wrong? Hmm?

14:46.051 --> 14:46.886
Change.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.473
Ma'am? Your change.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.442
If you're ever around the Hill,
you gotta stop to say hello, okay, Cindy?

15:01.525 --> 15:03.152
(sarcastically) I'll definitely do that.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.738
You've been investigating
for over an hour, Detective.

15:05.821 --> 15:06.697
Let's go, girls.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.158
Mrs. Hardtack,
the law's got to take its course.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.161
Detective, maneuvers are over as of now.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.288
I'm only halfway through my witness list.

15:14.371 --> 15:17.374
Man-to-man, John.
Say goodbye to vestal virgins.

15:17.458 --> 15:22.129
Regulations do not permit the exploiting
of an investigation for personal gain.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.797
Captain's orders.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.967
You believe this miscarriage
of justice, Neal?

15:28.802 --> 15:31.096
Can I speak to you a minute
in private, Detective?

15:31.180 --> 15:34.308
Sure, Debbie.
Excuse us, Detective Washington.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.144
Yeah, what is it, darlin'?

15:37.227 --> 15:39.229
Um, my friends told me about you,

15:39.313 --> 15:42.691
and, well, I'm a lot more
mature than they are.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.361
And, well, I don't usually do this...

15:46.111 --> 15:47.404
You're interested?

15:48.364 --> 15:49.698
It's my private number.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.534
Promise me you'll call?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.371
Yeah, I promise.

15:58.707 --> 16:01.710
FRANK: I can't comment on that
until our investigation's completed.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.172
You'll have to call the hospital
for that information.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.090
Fine.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.177
-Hello, Ray.
-The Gonzalez incident?

16:10.260 --> 16:12.346
-You heard.
-That's why I'm here.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.934
Field representative?
Latin-American coalition?

16:17.017 --> 16:18.268
Going on two months now.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.688
I've been meaning to call, catch up.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.189
How can I help?

16:22.272 --> 16:25.859
I'd like to have my files regarding
Spanish education in the department.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.111
What's this about?

16:27.194 --> 16:30.114
There have been too many incidents
of the kind involving Gonzalez.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.367
The coalition is filing a suit
against the department.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.535
For what?

16:34.618 --> 16:36.787
Our position is that
this morning's shooting

16:36.870 --> 16:39.498
was caused by the indifference
to the needs of our people

16:39.581 --> 16:40.958
for a Spanish-speaking police.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.876
The facts aren't clear. Gonzalez--

16:42.960 --> 16:44.795
If Parker spoke Spanish,

16:45.421 --> 16:47.631
the shooting would not have happened,
and you know it, Frank.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.718
And you know it's not possible
for every officer to speak Spanish.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.052
Not every officer!

16:52.136 --> 16:54.513
Just those covering Hispanic areas.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.599
We used to talk about this, Frank.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.144
You helped me write those letters
to Chief Daniels.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.979
You know what's in the files!

17:02.062 --> 17:04.064
Funding situation hasn't changed.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.234
I get money for one optional program,
and we use it for neighborhood outreach.

17:07.317 --> 17:10.654
I won't be talked out of this.
I no longer wear a badge.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.240
I can't give you those files
without the city attorney's permission.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.825
Then we'll get them by subpoena.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.910
And we'll show
all the letters from Daniels

17:16.994 --> 17:18.746
making promises that were never kept.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.831
Is that what this is about,
getting back at the chief?

17:21.123 --> 17:23.125
-Is that what you think?
-I don't know.

17:24.668 --> 17:25.711
Maybe it is.

17:26.754 --> 17:29.048
But the law is behind me this time.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.967
I don't have to be afraid of him.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.263
For years I tried to change things
and got nowhere.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.725
Now something will finally be done.

17:43.604 --> 17:44.688
(door slams)

17:45.606 --> 17:47.316
Hey, Ray, <i>que pasa, amigo?</i>

17:49.318 --> 17:53.197
Uh, Lieutenant, you have
a "notify officer" on Alfred Williams?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.114
Yes.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.700
I just heard he's at his sister's.
Here's the address.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.744
I'll need backup, two men.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.498
-(police siren wails in distance)
-(chattering)

18:06.210 --> 18:07.503
Nothing happening.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.048
(sighs) It's cold out here.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.966
<i>You know where I'd like to be tonight.</i>

18:13.050 --> 18:17.471
<i>Catch a movie and just lay in suds,</i>
<i>taking a nice, hot bath.</i>

18:17.554 --> 18:18.639
Sounds nice.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.811
Yeah, except she's undercover,
not public speaking.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.608
Aah, slow.

18:30.901 --> 18:31.902
You pulling any dates?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.612
Nah, it's chill.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.990
-Where you from, honey?
-Detroit.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.867
Long bus ride.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.953
We be wife-in-laws, you know?

18:41.286 --> 18:44.665
Same stable, I mean. We're Ponchartrain.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.500
I don't know Ponchartrain.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.253
I work for myself.
I like to keep what I earn.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.590
Ponchartrain owns
the franchise here, honey.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.510
She say she want to work for herself.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.847
No such a thing on this street.
You choose...

18:59.930 --> 19:00.806
<i>or you lose.</i>

19:00.889 --> 19:02.266
TINA: <i>I'm getting the picture.</i>

19:03.183 --> 19:06.270
Ponchartrain buy you a rabbit coat, honey.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.690
You pretty... and White.

19:11.692 --> 19:15.487
But you fling him attitude,
he definitely gonna kick your teeth in.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.866
Just a little friendly advice, mamacita.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.787
Hey! I can make you happy!

19:23.871 --> 19:27.082
So last night around 9:30
I'm trying get some sleep, right?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.458
The phone rings. It's him, Ellis.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.794
He wants to talk to Daryl Ann
right then and there.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.087
What did he want?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.840
Well, she said he wanted to talk about
some investors and their business,

19:34.923 --> 19:37.467
but I hear the two of them
talking in hush-hush tones.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.720
Well, probably because she knew
you were sitting there

19:39.803 --> 19:40.971
ready to blow your stack.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.724
Just the idea of the two of them together
drives me nuts.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.225
Renko, listen to me.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.020
You're making too much out of this.
Daryl Ann loves you.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.273
Now, you go to her this afternoon,
and you talk it out.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.524
-You understand?
-Yeah.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.109
Yeah. And then you go
your night-school class

19:54.193 --> 19:56.403
and start getting your mind
on a positive track

19:56.486 --> 19:58.697
before you jump it altogether.

19:59.865 --> 20:00.824
Hey, Mick.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.160
Lee?

20:03.702 --> 20:04.703
Can I talk to you?

20:05.412 --> 20:06.288
(sighs)

20:07.581 --> 20:10.292
All right, just for a second,
'cause I got to be somewhere.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.921
Uh, go back here.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.220
(door closes)

20:22.763 --> 20:23.680
You look terrible.

20:23.764 --> 20:24.932
Yeah, well, I've been off the program.

20:25.015 --> 20:25.849
Oh, Lee!

20:25.933 --> 20:27.935
-But I just got back on, Mick.
-Well, stay on.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.436
Look, I got something for you.

20:29.519 --> 20:30.896
No, I can't. I'm due in court.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.439
Stolen credit cards--

20:32.522 --> 20:35.275
It's righteous information, Mick.
I swear. You know I helped you out before.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.777
This chick's dealing them.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.029
Try me in a couple of days.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.447
Mick, I need a break.

20:43.158 --> 20:46.245
Okay. When I get the chance,

20:46.328 --> 20:48.038
and if it checks out,
I'll get you some money.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.623
You know where I hang, right?

20:49.706 --> 20:53.961
-Goodbye, Lee.
-101st and Dekker? The park there?

20:54.711 --> 20:56.964
-It's good, Mick.
-(door opens, closes)

20:58.423 --> 20:59.466
(baby cries)

21:06.974 --> 21:08.183
Police! Open up!

21:11.061 --> 21:13.230
Miss Williams, police. We're coming in.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.189
(door opens)

21:14.940 --> 21:16.149
What you want with us?

21:17.150 --> 21:18.360
We're looking for your brother Alfred.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.279
Hell with Alfred. He ain't here.

21:20.362 --> 21:24.866
-We'll have to look for ourselves.
-(rattling)

21:24.950 --> 21:26.618
-(grunts)
-Alfie!

21:26.702 --> 21:29.746
-(screams)
-MISS WILLIAMS: No!

21:29.830 --> 21:31.415
I'll do him, Goldblume!

21:31.498 --> 21:33.250
We have a man out there.
There's no chance.

21:35.335 --> 21:36.169
You...

21:37.212 --> 21:38.046
Damn!

21:38.463 --> 21:40.674
You did this to me, Goldblume!

21:41.258 --> 21:45.137
Carl Mann knew I wore a wire for you.
I had to waste him!

21:45.220 --> 21:47.514
He put the word out on me. I was dead!

21:47.597 --> 21:50.851
Then it was self-defense.
We can make something out of that, Alfred.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.562
-Alfred, listen to me.
-Listen to you?

21:54.896 --> 21:56.940
Again? (scoffs)

21:57.024 --> 21:58.984
I'll testify. I promise.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.361
But if you hurt the boy...

22:01.445 --> 22:03.196
MISS WILLIAMS: Alfie, don't hurt my baby!

22:03.280 --> 22:04.698
It's your own nephew.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.491
-You're not gonna hurt your own nephew.
-Shut up!

22:06.908 --> 22:09.995
-MISS WILLIAMS: Don't do it, Alfie.
-(laughs)

22:10.078 --> 22:12.414
You trying to play me again, Goldblume.

22:13.665 --> 22:14.958
We're going out front!

22:15.751 --> 22:18.503
MISS WILLIAMS (crying):
No! No!

22:20.839 --> 22:23.091
-You all? Back away!
-HENRY: Alfred.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.384
Now!

22:24.468 --> 22:27.929
MISS WILLIAMS: Alfie, you can't do this!
Don't hurt my boy!

22:29.097 --> 22:30.307
Oh, don't.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.813
You stop there, Goldblume.
I'll do what I got to do.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.148
It isn't over, Alfred.

22:39.232 --> 22:40.400
I can help. Let me help!

22:40.484 --> 22:42.361
Man, all you do is help.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.821
You're gonna help me get out of the Blood.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.948
Help me do my art.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.784
Now, Alfred's gonna help himself.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.827
You hear?! You hear?!

22:50.911 --> 22:54.039
MAN: Hey, what's going on here?

22:54.122 --> 22:55.582
(gunfire)

22:55.665 --> 22:59.544
Oh, God! (cries)

23:04.341 --> 23:05.175
FRANK: Chief.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.761
Time to circle the wagons, Frank.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.930
Our old friend Raymondo's
getting up a war party

23:10.013 --> 23:11.264
to attack the department.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.682
I think that's a little extreme.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.351
Amazing the way he's bounced back.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.270
Only a few short months ago,
he was known as "Captain Taco."

23:17.354 --> 23:19.106
I thought he'd be teaching
driver's ed by now.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.108
His case against us is pretty strong.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.360
Press conferences? Exclusive interviews?

23:23.443 --> 23:25.904
Certainly didn't show that much initiative
when he was in uniform, huh?

23:25.987 --> 23:27.739
Strictly <i>siesta</i> time then.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.159
But get a touch of the limelight...
(scoffs)

23:31.243 --> 23:35.122
Some days, Frank, I am appalled
at the moral sinkhole we all work in.

23:35.705 --> 23:36.540
What can I do?

23:36.623 --> 23:39.042
I want this suit stopped.
It's an embarrassment.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.378
If you're asking me
to use my friendship with Ray--

23:41.461 --> 23:43.046
Spare the sermon, will you, Frank?

23:43.463 --> 23:44.756
Just set up a meeting.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.758
Why do you need me?

23:46.842 --> 23:49.386
Because <i>el taco grande</i>
won't return my phone calls.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.138
Okay.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.682
Oh!

23:54.266 --> 23:57.185
I brought a copy of all the files
that he's after.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.020
Interesting reading.

24:00.188 --> 24:03.024
I guarantee you, Frank,
if this suit proceeds,

24:03.900 --> 24:06.570
it won't be my posterior alone
that's flapping in the breeze.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.156
-(chattering)
-Oh, hello, Joyce.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.282
Chief.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.243
I hate it when that man smiles.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.578
-Good instincts.
-(door closes)

24:14.661 --> 24:15.745
Problem?

24:15.829 --> 24:19.332
Daniels covered himself
on the Spanish language requirements.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.750
He put out a memo

24:20.834 --> 24:23.336
that passed responsibility
down to the precinct captains.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.379
Meaning you.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.672
Know any good lawyers?

24:27.757 --> 24:29.843
Frank, does Ray realize
how this can hurt you?

24:29.926 --> 24:31.928
He couldn't have known about the memo.
Came after he left.

24:32.012 --> 24:34.014
-Then tell him.
-I can't do that.

24:34.097 --> 24:37.767
If Ray thinks it's his duty to file suit,
I'm not gonna stop him.

24:37.851 --> 24:41.521
You're feeling guilty that you didn't
save his precinct for him. Is that it?

24:41.605 --> 24:43.607
-So now you're letting him do this to you.
-Joyce.

24:43.690 --> 24:44.941
At least let him know.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.111
If he's strong enough
to decide on his own,

24:48.195 --> 24:50.363
he's strong enough
to face all the consequences.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.365
-Counselor, enough.
-Sorry, Furillo.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.618
You wanted a lawyer's advice.
You got a wife's.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.705
RENKO: Daryl, I am sorry to have you
come all the way down here,

24:58.788 --> 25:01.625
but I had something to talk to you about,
and it just cannot wait.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.794
Andy, that's okay.
I have something to tell you too.

25:04.878 --> 25:08.882
Well, and the last thing I want to do
is keep you away from your work.

25:08.965 --> 25:11.551
Oh, I can hardly believe that,
the way you've been carrying on.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.970
Daryl, I've been terrible, and I know it.
I just wanna tell you that.

25:14.054 --> 25:14.930
(chuckles)

25:15.013 --> 25:18.058
I mean, here you are, trying to make
a place in this world for yourself.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.476
-And for us.
-Yeah.

25:19.559 --> 25:22.145
And all I can do is rant and rave
about this guy Ellis,

25:22.229 --> 25:24.481
when it's perfectly natural
that you should need a business partner,

25:24.564 --> 25:27.901
and you should find somebody
with the experience to help you.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.319
And I know that now.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.739
Oh, you pretty thing.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.158
How could I distrust you?

25:35.242 --> 25:38.578
Oh. (laughs)

25:39.412 --> 25:41.414
Okay, that's all I want to say.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.166
(laughing) Oh!

25:44.125 --> 25:45.752
I'm so glad!

25:45.835 --> 25:48.213
-I'm so happy you understand.
-Oh, I do.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.549
'Cause it makes it easier
for me to tell you.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.675
Tell me what?

25:51.758 --> 25:54.928
I mean, I had no idea, none,
how I was gonna tell you.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.096
Tell me.

25:56.179 --> 25:59.599
Andy, Mr. Ellis wants me to go
on a business trip with him.

26:00.517 --> 26:03.186
-(laughs)
-What did you say?

26:03.270 --> 26:04.980
Yeah! Overnight.

26:05.063 --> 26:08.066
Upstate. He's got these friends
with department stores,

26:08.149 --> 26:10.652
and he thinks we can persuade them
to sell our cookies.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.113
Where you gonna stay, some motel?

26:13.196 --> 26:16.533
Some motel with a vibrating bed
or something like that, huh?

26:16.616 --> 26:19.452
Andy, it's not like that.
You know you're my one and only.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.581
No, I know I was. Now, it's Ellis
and overnight business trips.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.790
And to hell with me.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.084
Well, to hell with you, Daryl Ann.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.963
Andy, no, I'll tell him I won't go.

26:30.046 --> 26:32.257
No, you tell him anything you want.
Hear me?

26:32.799 --> 26:35.427
I'm tired of this.
You do whatever you want to do.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.471
(sighs)

26:41.891 --> 26:43.143
You're pathetic.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.270
Oh, yeah?

26:46.104 --> 26:47.105
You know what you are.

26:50.650 --> 26:54.863
ALL: One nation, under God, indivisible,

26:54.946 --> 26:58.199
with liberty and justice for all.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.956
Chief Daniels offers his apologies.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.960
He had to be called away
on urgent police business.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.255
And I received
a telephone call this morning

27:12.672 --> 27:15.842
if I would stand in for him
and present these awards.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.802
And naturally I said yes,
it would be a great honor.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.597
So the world came around.
They're giving you the medal, huh?

27:21.473 --> 27:24.184
I don't want to say the system works,
'cause it don't work,

27:24.267 --> 27:28.855
but, uh, sometimes things
just coincidentally come out right.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.191
I'm real proud of you.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.277
Thanks, Norm.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.989
Your dad would have been real proud.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.617
What did you do, adopt me?

27:41.076 --> 27:44.371
Yeah. Ain't you been paying attention?
(chuckles)

27:45.455 --> 27:48.875
Jack Metcalf's widow, two kids to raise.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.418
What a life.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.295
Isn't it?

27:53.046 --> 27:55.632
(sighs) Whatever the thing is, kid.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.550
...on the second of last month,

27:57.634 --> 28:01.012
responding to a call,
"Officer needs assistance."

28:01.763 --> 28:05.433
Officer Jack Metcalf,
of the Jefferson Heights precinct,

28:06.017 --> 28:10.105
a veteran of 15 years with that precinct,

28:10.188 --> 28:13.149
came upon his fellow officer shot, unarmed

28:14.484 --> 28:16.194
and in mortal peril.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.240
Officer Metcalf
came to his aid, stepped in

28:20.323 --> 28:23.660
and drew the fire of three armed
assailants, and he himself...

28:26.287 --> 28:27.789
perished in that fight.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.376
He leaves behind him
a loving wife, Claire,

28:31.459 --> 28:35.088
and two sons, one ten and one two.

28:37.340 --> 28:41.302
What can begin to compensate them
for their loss?

28:42.178 --> 28:46.975
Where can relief
for their sorrow come from?

28:48.017 --> 28:49.436
Nowhere in the world.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.521
And we mourn with them.

28:55.316 --> 28:58.069
In the highest tradition
of the department,

28:58.570 --> 29:01.239
Officer Jack Metcalf is awarded the...

29:03.324 --> 29:04.409
medal of valor.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.371
This is for you, Mrs. Metcalf.

29:13.293 --> 29:16.880
We all take courage
from your husband's example.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.298
You all right?

29:18.381 --> 29:20.592
And we will forever honor his memory.

29:21.634 --> 29:24.387
There is not a speck of doubt in my mind

29:24.471 --> 29:27.724
that Daryl Ann is heading
for the bright lights with Ellis.

29:28.558 --> 29:29.851
Renko, are you sure?

29:29.934 --> 29:34.481
She is flying upstate overnight
to a motel with this rich jerk.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.734
-Do I have to take pictures?
-People go on business trips all the time.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.110
Not Daryl Ann!

29:39.194 --> 29:41.654
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Noise complaint at 322 Dekker.</i>

29:41.738 --> 29:43.656
<i>Any unit in vicinity,</i>
<i>identify and respond.</i>

29:43.740 --> 29:45.742
Twenty-two-oh-two in response.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.995
-(police siren wailing)
-This clown killer strikes again, right?

29:49.078 --> 29:52.916
(playing upbeat jazz)

29:53.625 --> 29:56.920
They ruining my business!
Nobody's listening to the clown--

29:58.171 --> 30:00.715
There's no accounting
for public tastes, now.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.759
RENKO: Stop it! Stop it!

30:04.511 --> 30:07.263
What's the matter, Johnson, man?
You don't dig real sounds?

30:07.347 --> 30:10.099
That's very funny, man. I hope
you retain your sense of humor in jail.

30:10.183 --> 30:14.020
Mr. Crumley, you can't play music
on the street without a city permit.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.855
I got a right to practice.

30:15.939 --> 30:17.357
Not if it messes up my business.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.484
Now calm down
and talk about it, all right?

30:19.567 --> 30:22.070
Hey, man. Look, man.
Soon as you guys left, man,

30:22.153 --> 30:23.613
-he turned that clown up to max, right?
-Yeah.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.991
Now, these are ears, man,
very sensitive audio equipment.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.744
I listen to "Train," "Bird," Lester Young.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.705
Do you know what it does to these ears
to listen to that clown all day?

30:32.789 --> 30:34.123
BOBBY: Listen, Johnson, um,

30:34.207 --> 30:37.460
these people are over here
to listen to Mr. Crumley. Am I right?

30:39.379 --> 30:40.588
Yeah, you're right.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.591
But meanwhile the clown is starving,
and I'm losing money.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.260
Just-just hear me out.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.763
Now, Mr. Crumley,
you wouldn't mind that clown

30:48.847 --> 30:50.890
if it played music that you like, right?

30:50.974 --> 30:53.393
-I mean, you're a musician, and--
-Where you going with this, Bobby?

30:55.270 --> 30:58.398
Mr. Johnson, why don't you
let Mr. Crumley here

30:58.481 --> 30:59.983
write you a new song?

31:01.526 --> 31:04.445
Maybe the kind
that's gonna draw customers,

31:04.529 --> 31:06.114
like the crowd he's got here now?

31:06.990 --> 31:08.575
I'll write you something hip, man.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.243
You'll love it.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.954
CLOWN: ♪ <i>And you'll say, "hurray"</i> ♪

31:13.037 --> 31:16.291
-(sighs) You got a deal.
-(laughs)

31:16.374 --> 31:19.586
-Man, you love it.
-(laughing)

31:20.044 --> 31:21.170
(whistles)

31:23.423 --> 31:25.008
TINA: Oh, no, open the window.

31:25.091 --> 31:26.467
Come on, open up.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.721
Hey, you don't want her.
Oh, come on. Come on back here.

31:31.431 --> 31:32.640
-Just a baby.
-Hey, baby.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.394
Hey, baby. You, baby.
Yeah, you are looking so pretty.

31:36.477 --> 31:37.604
Wait a minute. Hold it now. Look here.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.898
Why don't you just listen to Ponchartrain
for just a minute?

31:39.981 --> 31:42.692
No. Look, I know what you want,
and I've been thinking about it.

31:42.775 --> 31:44.611
But I haven't made up my mind yet.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.946
See, it's insurance, baby.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.949
Simple as that. I am your life insurance.

31:50.533 --> 31:52.118
I'm doing all right up till now.

31:52.201 --> 31:54.704
Oh, yeah, up till now.
But up till now is history.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.080
TINA: <i>I was never good in history.</i>

31:56.164 --> 31:57.749
She's got to watch this dude.

31:57.832 --> 31:59.292
She's okay. She can handle it.

31:59.375 --> 32:02.545
<i>See, Ponchartrain ain't asking.</i>
<i>He's telling.</i>

32:02.629 --> 32:04.047
-Let's go.
-Not yet.

32:04.130 --> 32:07.216
See, a lot of girls,
they get hurt on this block, real bad.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.135
Now, look, I never did nothing to you.

32:09.218 --> 32:12.847
Right. But now you're gonna do for me.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.643
Ow! Ah!

32:17.101 --> 32:18.811
(yelling)

32:18.895 --> 32:21.397
-(thudding)
-(Tina groans)

32:25.401 --> 32:26.277
Come on!

32:30.156 --> 32:31.157
You okay?

32:31.240 --> 32:33.409
I could use some help over here!

32:34.160 --> 32:35.662
Flaherty?!

32:42.502 --> 32:43.670
Are you okay, Sarge?

32:44.295 --> 32:45.296
Yeah.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.843
-Heard about Alfred Williams, Lieutenant.
-I got the statements right.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.512
Let me know when IAD calls.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.348
Hello, Debbie.

32:56.516 --> 32:59.310
Hi. Guess who, Debbie?

32:59.769 --> 33:00.687
WOMAN (on recording): <i>Hi.</i>

33:00.770 --> 33:04.190
-Hi.
<i>-If you're under 18, hang up now.</i>

33:05.108 --> 33:07.568
<i>I'll bet when you came home,</i>
<i>you didn't expect to find</i>

33:07.652 --> 33:09.570
<i>two naked women in your bathtub.</i>

33:09.654 --> 33:10.655
It's for you, Raymond.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.073
Hello.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.450
<i>We've been watching you</i>
<i>at work for a few days now,</i>

33:14.534 --> 33:17.578
<i>and your body's been driving us wild.</i>

33:17.662 --> 33:19.288
<i>So Roxanne and I thought...</i>

33:19.372 --> 33:20.373
(knock on door)

33:20.456 --> 33:22.250
Ray, come in, come in!

33:24.460 --> 33:26.963
-How are you?
-Fine, Chief.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.214
Captain.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.677
Well... call me sentimental,

33:33.261 --> 33:36.305
but seeing the three of us here
together again brings back old times.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.057
They weren't all good times, Chief.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.226
I won't mince words.

33:40.768 --> 33:42.311
We need you back on the force.

33:43.104 --> 33:46.149
How does "Special Consultant
on Hispanic Affairs" sound to you?

33:46.232 --> 33:48.609
Before coming here, I asked myself,

33:49.402 --> 33:54.574
"What will the chief offer to keep me
from performing my duties in this matter?"

33:55.324 --> 33:57.493
"My old job or a consultancy."

33:58.161 --> 33:59.829
If this is your idea of a joke--

33:59.912 --> 34:01.706
You can't buy me off!

34:03.041 --> 34:07.920
An innocent man is lying in a hospital,
possibly paralyzed for life.

34:08.796 --> 34:10.048
I want my files.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.594
So I was wrong about you, huh, Ray?

34:14.677 --> 34:16.095
You're not one of us after all.

34:18.097 --> 34:21.350
But don't try convincing yourself
that you're doing this for your people.

34:22.518 --> 34:23.978
What I'm offering you is real.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.648
Every policy that would impact
on the Hispanic community

34:27.732 --> 34:28.900
would come through you.

34:33.988 --> 34:36.908
(sighs) All right, Frank,
give him whatever files he wants.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.494
But when you look them over,

34:40.286 --> 34:43.122
make sure you notice
where the finger is pointing, hmm.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.333
(door opens)

34:46.125 --> 34:47.418
It's not at me.

34:49.921 --> 34:50.922
(door closes)

34:51.005 --> 34:51.839
I'm sorry.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.382
What does he mean?

34:54.008 --> 34:56.094
He sent out a memo six months ago.

34:56.636 --> 35:00.389
Precinct captains are now responsible
for continuing language instruction

35:00.473 --> 35:02.809
or rather,
nonexistent Spanish instruction.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.977
You knew this before,
and you didn't say anything?

35:05.061 --> 35:06.437
I didn't think it was relevant.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.564
You have to do what you think is right.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.025
Yes, what I think is right.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.070
You're a good friend to me, Frank.

35:15.404 --> 35:18.658
But I must decide what my duty
in this situation is.

35:22.745 --> 35:23.746
(door closes)

35:32.130 --> 35:34.006
So I got this undercover thing.

35:34.590 --> 35:37.885
I need a girl,
someone to pass in the high life,

35:37.969 --> 35:41.013
who doesn't sound like she's chewing gum
even when she is.

35:42.306 --> 35:45.017
-And that's me?
-And that's you.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.437
And now you see, uh, you got a ribbon.

35:48.521 --> 35:51.983
Now, today, tomorrow,
everybody at the post congratulating you.

35:52.066 --> 35:54.443
You put in a request,
they're odds-on to grant it.

35:54.527 --> 35:55.695
Undercover?

35:55.778 --> 35:56.904
Norm?

35:56.988 --> 35:59.490
Hey, Solly! It's good to see you.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.576
Solly Riposo, Kate McBride.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.703
-Kate, congratulations.
-Thank you.

36:03.786 --> 36:04.662
You got a minute?

36:05.288 --> 36:06.539
I got a minute, yeah.

36:06.622 --> 36:07.582
I'll be right back.

36:16.883 --> 36:18.301
MAN: Trying to maneuver, see?

36:18.384 --> 36:20.303
Work him around
till I get a good shot down.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.221
Down Clinton Street, you understand?

36:22.305 --> 36:25.725
The guy's drawing on me.
By that time, I'm on my way to the ground.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.644
Joey's down.
I don't know how bad he's hurt.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.646
My gun hand's sweating.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.192
Well, I dive to the ground,
get one shot off at him

36:34.275 --> 36:36.194
just before he turns the corner.

36:36.277 --> 36:40.239
If ever there's anything
that I or anyone in my command can do.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.241
Thank you. You've been very kind.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.868
At any time at all.

36:48.789 --> 36:49.957
Mrs. Metcalf.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.419
Officer McBride, congratulations.

36:54.003 --> 36:54.837
Thank you.

36:55.630 --> 36:59.592
It's, uh, it's nice
to receive some recognition.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.093
Yes, ma'am.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.346
Oh, well.

37:03.429 --> 37:05.932
-I'm very sorry about your husband.
-Thank you.

37:06.015 --> 37:08.517
That was a lovely speech
the inspector gave. Don't you think?

37:09.143 --> 37:10.269
Yes, it was.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.398
Mrs. Metcalf, my father
was a member of the force.

37:14.857 --> 37:17.568
-He died in the line of duty when I was--
-Excuse me, Mrs. Metcalf?

37:17.818 --> 37:20.613
I'd like to introduce you
to State Senator O'Brien.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.949
I'm sorry. Would you excuse me, please?

37:28.246 --> 37:30.122
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.584
You can call me Kate. That's my name.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.130
-What's your name?
-John Metcalf Jr.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.675
Glad to meet you, John.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.845
How long have you
been in the police force?

37:45.721 --> 37:47.723
Not long, about four years.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.142
Did you know my father?

37:51.310 --> 37:52.478
No, son, I didn't.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.439
I wish I had.

37:55.982 --> 37:56.941
CLAIRE: Johnny?

37:57.483 --> 37:58.901
Listen to me, John.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.237
I want to tell you something,

38:01.988 --> 38:04.782
because I went through what
you're going through right now.

38:05.199 --> 38:06.993
I went through it when I was your age.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.160
Johnny?

38:11.580 --> 38:12.498
And I want you to know

38:12.581 --> 38:15.751
that in addition to your mother
and your family--

38:15.835 --> 38:16.669
CLAIRE: Johnny?

38:16.752 --> 38:19.213
That there's someone
that knows what you suffer.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.091
That someone loves you.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.052
CLAIRE: Come on, John.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.265
Goodbye. Thank you.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.562
So, uh...

38:35.187 --> 38:36.897
How about a drink a little later?

38:37.481 --> 38:40.318
I know they popped you
from the roster for the day.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.403
-You free?
-Yep.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.447
So be it.

38:44.864 --> 38:48.409
I'll, uh, I'll meet you at the Hill Street
station after the shift, huh?

38:48.492 --> 38:49.452
Okay.

38:51.537 --> 38:52.705
Officer McBride?

38:53.831 --> 38:56.334
Congratulations. Hell of a fine job.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.420
-You're a credit to the force.
-Thank you, sir.

39:08.929 --> 39:09.764
MICK: Captain?

39:10.264 --> 39:12.683
I need a couple hundred
for a credit card buy.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.728
-Good tip?
-Well, the guy's come through before.

39:15.811 --> 39:18.022
Draw it from discretionary.
I'll put it through.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.567
Good bust, you three.

39:22.109 --> 39:24.320
I hear the assailant
has three out-of-state priors.

39:24.403 --> 39:25.613
Thanks, Captain.

39:25.696 --> 39:30.534
-Lucy... is that hand okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.578
Just a couple butterfly bandages.

39:32.661 --> 39:34.080
-Good work.
-Thanks.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.666
A word, you two.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.173
-You screwed up!
-Sarge, I--

39:44.256 --> 39:46.175
What is the drill
on a bust like this, huh?

39:46.258 --> 39:50.346
Subdue the perp, frisk him,
and then cuff him. You left me at risk.

39:50.429 --> 39:52.681
What? How? I knocked him on his butt!

39:52.765 --> 39:53.682
Did you frisk him?

39:53.766 --> 39:55.851
-I was gonna frisk him.
-You didn't frisk him!

39:57.395 --> 39:59.355
Like a couple of rookies out there,
both of you.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.399
You on the wire, playing around.

40:01.482 --> 40:02.566
You shouldn't be allowed to work together.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.443
-Hey, now wait a minute--
-I'm not deaf!

40:05.236 --> 40:06.278
I heard what you said.

40:06.779 --> 40:11.200
"I know where I'd like to be.
Catch a movie. Nice, hot bath at home."

40:13.327 --> 40:14.412
And I'm not blind.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.167
I told you.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.920
Lay off for once, will you?

40:33.597 --> 40:35.266
-I'm sorry, Henry.
-Sorry?

40:35.516 --> 40:38.352
Sorry you had to shoot Alfred Williams.
I know you wanted to save him.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.563
That was impossible. We needed him.

40:41.021 --> 40:43.149
We wanted Carl Mann,
and Alfred was our only way at him.

40:43.649 --> 40:44.817
Henry...

40:45.609 --> 40:46.527
No, I mean it.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.196
(sighs)

40:50.781 --> 40:52.408
I don't blame us for Alfred's death.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.493
For once, I don't blame us.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.663
-Okay.
-It's beyond that, what I'm feeling.

40:59.081 --> 41:02.751
I know the reasons Alfred Williams died,
why I had to kill him.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.003
And they're good reasons.

41:04.628 --> 41:06.589
But they're beginning not to work for me.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.217
As a cop, I don't trust myself
very much anymore.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.470
And I see you've stopped trusting me,

41:12.553 --> 41:13.846
the way you kept me off
the Gonzalez shooting today.

41:13.929 --> 41:15.347
It isn't that I don't trust you.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.184
It's I-I just don't know
where your attention is anymore.

41:18.851 --> 41:21.353
What are you, the department
self-appointed reformer?

41:21.437 --> 41:23.939
A writer? A police officer?
I don't know where you are.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.692
I'm here. I'm here.

41:26.775 --> 41:27.610
No, you're not.

41:28.694 --> 41:31.655
Whatever you're going through personally,
I'm with you as your friend.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.533
But as your captain,
I have to know what to expect from you.

41:34.617 --> 41:35.826
And right now, you don't.

41:42.541 --> 41:44.835
We used to say it was my strength.
Remember, Frank?

41:45.669 --> 41:47.922
That I saw more of the picture
than other cops?

41:49.340 --> 41:50.549
Maybe it's not a strength anymore.

41:50.633 --> 41:53.719
It's time for you to decide
that for yourself, Henry. That's all.

41:54.053 --> 41:55.054
It's just time.

41:57.556 --> 42:01.560
(door opens, closes)

42:01.936 --> 42:04.104
Yes, Officer Shipman.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.106
So there will be no further investigation.

42:06.815 --> 42:08.526
I'm sure Parker's relieved.

42:09.401 --> 42:10.903
Thanks for letting me know.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.030
Ray.

42:13.447 --> 42:15.741
We dropped the suit, and I'm glad, Frank.

42:15.824 --> 42:17.409
Glad because you don't have to be hurt.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.995
-I hope that's not the reason.
-No, it wasn't.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.872
The offer that Daniels made...

42:22.414 --> 42:24.458
He must have been crazy with fear.

42:24.833 --> 42:27.503
I saw that it could be of use
to our cause,

42:27.586 --> 42:30.422
a civilian consultant on Hispanic policy.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.841
-That's unprecedented.
-You're taking the position.

42:32.925 --> 42:35.719
No, a young attorney
in our organization, Jose Rebor.

42:36.512 --> 42:37.930
He will do better than I could.

42:38.806 --> 42:42.810
We also got Daniels to agree
to Spanish classes in every precinct.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.020
He fought us, but we won.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.689
Will the instructors be from the academy?

42:47.731 --> 42:48.983
A private company...

42:50.067 --> 42:52.403
Calletano Language Incorporated.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.822
I'm learning, Frank.

42:57.199 --> 42:58.158
Wouldn't you say?

43:01.161 --> 43:02.288
(door closes)

43:08.711 --> 43:11.213
-Hey, Lucy.
-Hey, Kate.

43:11.297 --> 43:12.965
Want to go for a beer with me and Buntz?

43:13.716 --> 43:14.967
Uh...

43:15.050 --> 43:17.803
Uh, well... I just don't feel like it.
Thanks a lot.

43:18.804 --> 43:20.723
So you gonna tell me
what's wrong right out?

43:21.140 --> 43:23.058
Or are you gonna make me
do this song and dance

43:23.142 --> 43:25.311
about how I'm your friend
and so on and so forth?

43:25.686 --> 43:27.021
(locker door closes)

43:27.396 --> 43:29.898
What's the first thing
they tell a woman cop never to do?

43:30.649 --> 43:31.734
Sleep with your partner.

43:32.526 --> 43:33.360
Right.

43:33.819 --> 43:36.905
(scoffs) So leave it to me
to find something even worse, right?

43:36.989 --> 43:38.949
Wanting to sleep with your partner.

43:39.825 --> 43:41.535
And he's doing it with somebody else.

43:42.786 --> 43:43.912
Flaherty and Russo.

43:44.872 --> 43:48.667
I never even expected it.
I never suspected anything. I...

43:49.335 --> 43:51.086
Not even when he gave me
those lame excuses

43:51.170 --> 43:52.421
every time I wanted to go out with him.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.048
I mean, I bought it.

43:54.131 --> 43:56.884
I thought, "Yeah, sure.
We got a shot." I mean...

43:57.885 --> 43:59.803
Brilliant, huh? Really.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.180
It's human.

44:02.431 --> 44:03.265
Yeah.

44:05.517 --> 44:06.352
It hurts.

44:06.435 --> 44:07.561
Well, it's gonna hurt.

44:08.896 --> 44:11.857
It's gotta hurt,
but that's no reason to put yourself down.

44:14.568 --> 44:17.321
-You all right?
-(clears throat) Yeah.

44:17.404 --> 44:20.449
(clears throat)
You... You got a medal today.

44:20.532 --> 44:22.409
You got a medal today.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.286
Congratulations.

44:24.870 --> 44:27.581
Let's see it. Come on.

44:30.167 --> 44:31.960
Wait a minute. Here. Here.

44:33.295 --> 44:35.631
Oh. It's nice.

44:35.881 --> 44:39.134
WOMAN: All right, that's it for tonight.
Class dismissed.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.014
Uh, Miss Maxwell?

44:45.057 --> 44:46.475
-Billie Joe.
-Andrew J. Renko.

44:46.558 --> 44:48.310
Says here you and me
are supposed to be partners.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.479
We got $10,000 to invest.
You got any ideas?

44:50.562 --> 44:53.065
No, but I know you've got some,
the way you talk in class.

44:53.148 --> 44:54.983
Classic autos and windmills.

44:55.067 --> 44:56.527
Well, teacher doesn't like
the windmill idea.

44:56.610 --> 44:58.696
I like your ideas. They're bold.

44:58.779 --> 45:01.573
As a matter of fact, that's why I asked
to be partnered with you.

45:01.657 --> 45:04.076
You mean this isn't just some coincidence?
Some hand-of-fate kind of deal?

45:04.159 --> 45:06.370
(chuckles) I said I liked your ideas.

45:06.453 --> 45:08.664
If you're not in a hurry,
what do you say we go get a cup of coffee,

45:08.747 --> 45:09.957
start making a list?

45:11.667 --> 45:13.961
(siren wails in distance)

45:15.462 --> 45:16.797
Five hundred apiece.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.007
MICK (laughing): That's pretty steep.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.802
-(card rustles)
-Hey, they got a five-grand limit.

45:21.885 --> 45:23.220
That's steep and wide.

45:23.303 --> 45:25.431
-Yeah, but I'm taking a big risk.
-Uh-uh.

45:25.514 --> 45:29.351
They've been retooled.
You can't trace them. Worry free.

45:29.435 --> 45:30.686
Oh, really?

45:31.770 --> 45:34.022
One fifty. How's 150?

45:34.106 --> 45:35.607
Cheap, too cheap.

45:35.983 --> 45:39.987
If you could hook me up right away,
I got backers looking to make a big score.

45:40.070 --> 45:44.283
I mean, if you could connect me
with maybe 30, 40 cards.

45:44.366 --> 45:45.200
Maybe.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.953
How come I never seen you
in The Empire Club?

45:48.036 --> 45:50.831
Been out of town, upstate.

45:51.665 --> 45:53.041
What'd you take a fall for?

45:53.667 --> 45:54.501
(scoffs)

45:56.003 --> 45:58.547
All's I got with me is a couple C-notes.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.008
Okay.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.470
Look, Mick, I can get you
as many as you want,

46:04.553 --> 46:05.971
if it's really like you say.

46:06.054 --> 46:08.682
Well, how about two now

46:08.891 --> 46:12.311
and, uh... I'll get right back to you?

46:12.978 --> 46:13.812
Is that a deal?

46:14.521 --> 46:15.355
It's a deal.

46:19.318 --> 46:23.280
Well, I can work Thursday nights for sure
and then Sunday afternoons.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.491
Sunday afternoons? Well, I'll be.

46:25.574 --> 46:27.868
A southern boy isn't watching games on TV?

46:27.951 --> 46:29.828
Well, I'd rather play than watch.

46:30.412 --> 46:33.665
-Uh, Tennessee.
-Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

46:33.749 --> 46:36.043
Yes, yes. See, I could tell.
You know, people around here,

46:36.126 --> 46:37.878
they don't know a thing about accents.

46:38.378 --> 46:40.255
You know, they call me "cowboy."
Can you believe that?

46:40.339 --> 46:42.758
-Andrew, your wife gonna mind?
-What?

46:43.258 --> 46:44.843
Your working with a woman.

46:44.927 --> 46:45.761
Why should she?

46:46.678 --> 46:47.846
Some do.

46:49.056 --> 46:52.267
Well, she's working with a man,
and I don't mind.

46:52.351 --> 46:56.021
So that's what it is
I felt about you; right away.

46:56.104 --> 46:58.315
-What?
-That you're lonely.

46:59.566 --> 47:03.278
You see, I'm lonely, so I can tell.

47:05.614 --> 47:06.532
Goodnight.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.544
(car door opens)

47:19.962 --> 47:21.380
(engine revving)

47:24.675 --> 47:27.052
-Should I get in?
-Yes.

47:27.386 --> 47:28.595
Yes, please.

47:37.938 --> 47:39.022
(car door opens)

47:53.912 --> 47:54.746
(coughs)

48:04.715 --> 48:06.008
(gunshot)

48:16.018 --> 48:18.312
(closing theme playing)
