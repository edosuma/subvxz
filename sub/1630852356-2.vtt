00:01.130 --> 00:03.799
Okay, family,
last night, I had a dream.

00:03.800 --> 00:06.509
And in that dream,
I had a vision.

00:06.510 --> 00:07.629
[all] Uh-huh?

00:07.630 --> 00:09.459
People always come to us
for vegetables,

00:09.460 --> 00:11.509
but why don't we go to them?

00:11.510 --> 00:12.550
I give you...

00:15.210 --> 00:16.629
Good idea, boy!

00:16.630 --> 00:18.459
And I've already got
a bunch of orders,

00:18.460 --> 00:19.879
- so let's hit the road.
- [clank]

00:19.880 --> 00:21.589
Dad, I think
the mirror fell off.

00:21.590 --> 00:22.879
- It's fine!
- [clank]

00:22.880 --> 00:24.419
- [straining]
- Are you sure the truck

00:24.420 --> 00:26.459
can handle all these deliveries?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.299
What are you talkin' about?

00:28.300 --> 00:30.509
This old girl has weathered
many a storm.

00:30.510 --> 00:32.799
Plus the Kludge is
the only vehicle we have,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.249
so it's gonna have to work.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.509
- [grunting]
- [engine grinding]

00:35.510 --> 00:36.510
[backfire]

00:36.511 --> 00:37.919
And we're off!

00:37.920 --> 00:40.629
- [horns honking]
- [drivers shouting]

00:40.630 --> 00:42.249
Your car stinks and you stink!

00:42.250 --> 00:43.669
Get off the road!

00:43.670 --> 00:46.419
Dad, these other cars
seem kinda angry at us.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.419
Quiet, Cricket.
Daddy's concentrating.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.339
How long is this gonna take?

00:50.340 --> 00:52.669
Because I think my spine
is resetting.

00:52.670 --> 00:55.459
And I can't get
these dang seatbelts to click!

00:55.460 --> 00:56.919
- [Bill] Ooh, pothole!
- Aah! Oof!

00:56.920 --> 00:59.049
Dad, this truck is
literally falling apart!

00:59.050 --> 01:01.749
Whoa! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

01:01.750 --> 01:03.959
Gosh, don't stand so hard,
Cricket!

01:03.960 --> 01:05.749
Oh, hey, look, we're here!

01:05.750 --> 01:07.589
BigTech headquarters!

01:07.590 --> 01:10.379
[Cricket] Whoa, Remy told me
about this place!

01:10.380 --> 01:12.419
They make all kinds
of cool stuff!

01:12.420 --> 01:14.379
- [Bill] Aaaand made it!
- [truck wheezing]

01:14.380 --> 01:16.009
[Cricket, Tilly, and Gramma
gasping]

01:16.010 --> 01:19.419
Hello! Green Family Farms!
Fresh vegetable delivery!

01:19.420 --> 01:20.669
Did anyone order vegetables?!

01:20.670 --> 01:22.589
- Yes, me!
- Huh?

01:22.590 --> 01:24.919
Hello. I'm Gwendolyn Zapp!

01:24.920 --> 01:27.669
The incredibly wealthy,
incredibly smart CEO of BigTech!

01:27.670 --> 01:29.709
- Go home, boy!
- [robot voice] Bark-bark.

01:29.710 --> 01:31.459
I could end
all the world's problems,

01:31.460 --> 01:34.509
but instead I choose to
invent things like Robo-pants!

01:34.510 --> 01:38.009
Ms. Zapp, we need
to do a major recall
on the Robo-pants!

01:38.010 --> 01:40.129
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:40.130 --> 01:42.919
So where are those local
organic vegetables I ordered?

01:42.920 --> 01:44.249
Oh, right! [chuckles]

01:44.250 --> 01:45.419
Let me just
get 'em out of my truck.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.459
- [angelic music]
- [stammering]

01:48.460 --> 01:49.709
A Kludge!

01:49.710 --> 01:51.419
I had one of these
when I was a teen!

01:51.420 --> 01:52.959
Yeah, she's a classic,

01:52.960 --> 01:54.549
but she's definitely lost
some of her charm.

01:54.550 --> 01:56.749
She's perfect. Just perfect.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.589
Have you Greens, by chance,
heard of the Vrum?

01:59.590 --> 02:01.459
It's my latest invention!

02:01.460 --> 02:03.419
[female computer voice]
Hello, Green family.

02:03.420 --> 02:05.459
Wow! That's
a good lookin' vehicle!

02:05.460 --> 02:07.629
It's more than just pretty!
I've heard of this!

02:07.630 --> 02:09.459
It's got everything!
Like a Cray-Cray button

02:09.460 --> 02:11.299
that makes the car go so fast,

02:11.300 --> 02:13.249
I heard it blew
a guy's lips off!

02:13.250 --> 02:16.419
That's right, but we gave
that man a pair of Robo-lips,

02:16.420 --> 02:19.009
and now he can say
any word in the dictionary!

02:19.010 --> 02:21.549
- Except "lawsuit."
- [Greens] Wow!

02:21.550 --> 02:23.919
Oh, what's that, brain?
Another genius idea?

02:23.920 --> 02:27.509
Hey! How about if I give you
a brand new Vrum!

02:27.510 --> 02:28.709
- [kids gasp]
- Really?

02:28.710 --> 02:32.049
In exchange for your old Kludge!

02:32.050 --> 02:33.839
Trade in the Kludge?
She has been acting up lately.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.459
What do you think, kids?

02:35.460 --> 02:37.589
- What?! Say yes! Say yes!
- Dad, it's a robo-car!

02:37.590 --> 02:39.379
If you're thinking about this
for more than five seconds,

02:39.380 --> 02:40.959
you're an idiot.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.049
Well, okay!

02:42.050 --> 02:43.589
Take good care of her, will ya?

02:43.590 --> 02:47.169
You Greens are
out of this wooooorld!

02:47.170 --> 02:48.509
She's funny.

02:48.510 --> 02:49.629
[Vrum plays
soothing startup chime]

02:49.630 --> 02:50.959
I am your new Vrum.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.839
It is my job to serve you.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.549
Here, let me take
those off your hands.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.550
Oh!

02:57.840 --> 03:00.209
Well, I've never seen
a car do that before.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.339
[all] Whoa!

03:01.340 --> 03:03.339
Three passengers loaded.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.459
Scanning for fourth passenger.

03:05.460 --> 03:06.669

Hello, Green family.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.459
What would you like to call me?

03:17.460 --> 03:19.509
Gosh. I've never had
to name a car before,

03:19.510 --> 03:21.379
so I want it to be good--

03:21.380 --> 03:22.839
Dr. Bubblebutt!

03:22.840 --> 03:24.090
My name is...

03:25.550 --> 03:28.169
Uh, no, I'd like to change
the name, please.

03:28.170 --> 03:29.919
I cannot fulfill your request.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.589
Name locked forever.

03:31.590 --> 03:33.299
This car sure
is full of surprises.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.959
Laser scan initiating.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.339
What's that--
Aah! Kids, help!

Also, I noticed
an impacted molar.

Whoa! Hey!

04:00.510 --> 04:02.629

04:02.630 --> 04:04.009
No, an awesome dude like that

04:04.010 --> 04:05.419
wouldn't be trying
to get my attention.

04:05.420 --> 04:07.049
Yes, he is!
Open the window!

04:34.300 --> 04:36.339
Sure are a lot more
more seat settings
than the Kludge.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.549
The Kludge only had
one setting: awful!

04:38.550 --> 04:40.049
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:40.050 --> 04:43.009

Yes. Well, this list is
certainly a buffet of delights.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.839
And I will gorge on them all.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.169
[chuckles] Let's try...

Is something wrong?

05:10.590 --> 05:12.299
Just looking for the radio knob.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.589
Where are all the knobs?

05:13.590 --> 05:15.509
Oh, I use "air knobs."

05:15.510 --> 05:17.919
Just pretend
to turn a knob here!

Huh, weird. But okay...

[driver] Aah!

05:24.550 --> 05:27.049
Oh, jeez! The Kludge
never would've done that.

05:27.050 --> 05:30.549
Dr. Bubblebutt, you're
a little more complicated
than my old truck.

05:30.550 --> 05:32.129
You're doing great.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.419
Do you want to talk about it?

07:51.420 --> 07:52.959
[sigh] Yeah.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.799
Look, you're obviously
an incredible car.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.379
You don't creak or leak,

07:57.380 --> 07:59.209
and you get us there
in a timely fashion.

07:59.210 --> 08:01.879
But I still can't get over
missing my truck.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.379
I mean, I've had the Kludge
since I was a young man.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.749
She held strong
through thick and thin!

08:07.750 --> 08:10.549
Heck, the Kludge was
practically a member
of our family.

08:10.550 --> 08:12.459
And you don't get rid
of a family member,

08:12.460 --> 08:14.549
no matter how old
and leaky they get!

08:14.550 --> 08:16.589
- [kids] Yeah!
- I'm holdin' you to that.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.129
I'm sorry, Dr. Bubblebutt.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.129
You're a great car,
but you're not our car.

08:20.130 --> 08:21.879
Now take us back to the Kludge!

08:21.880 --> 08:23.669
[Vrum]
I am here to serve.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.379
Hey, Gwendolyn? We're coming
back to get my truck!

08:26.380 --> 08:27.709
Oh, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

08:27.710 --> 08:29.549
You see, I'm taking your truck

08:29.550 --> 08:31.549
to my vacation home on Mars!

08:31.550 --> 08:33.549
Mars?! The planet?!

08:33.550 --> 08:35.129
Uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh.

08:35.130 --> 08:37.419
Look, I'm incredibly rich
and incredibly crazy,

08:37.420 --> 08:39.709
and that makes
for one heck of a combo.

08:39.710 --> 08:43.709
Also, I'm leaving
in T-minus 30 seconds. Bye!

08:43.710 --> 08:45.299
She's taking the Kludge to Mars!

08:45.300 --> 08:47.709
- The planet?!
- That's what I said!

08:47.710 --> 08:49.509
She's leaving in 30 seconds!

08:49.510 --> 08:50.749
We'll never make it!

08:50.750 --> 08:52.339
You mean we have
to go incredibly fast

08:52.340 --> 08:54.589
in an incredibly
short amount of time?!

08:54.590 --> 08:56.669
Oh, gosh, okay.
Go ahead and do it!

08:56.670 --> 08:58.130
Thank you, Daddy!

09:01.090 --> 09:02.299
[screaming]

09:02.300 --> 09:04.549
Aaaah!

09:04.550 --> 09:06.049
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

09:06.050 --> 09:07.299
[laughing]

09:07.300 --> 09:08.630
Aah! My lips!

09:09.710 --> 09:11.919
- There it is!
- [screech]

09:11.920 --> 09:13.709
- We're just in time!
- Go, go, go!

09:13.710 --> 09:14.839
- [Vrum] Bill.
- Huh?

09:14.840 --> 09:16.419
Goodbye. I hope to one day

09:16.420 --> 09:18.709
be part of a family like yours.

09:18.710 --> 09:20.129
You will, Dr. Bubblebutt.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.249
I'm sure of it.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.509
- Come on, Dad!
- Come on!

09:22.510 --> 09:23.510
Aah! What?!

09:26.550 --> 09:28.049
Hey! My family's in there!

09:28.050 --> 09:29.549
All systems go!

09:29.550 --> 09:33.459
My Mars vay-cay
officially starts... now!

09:33.460 --> 09:35.049
Oh, my gosh, what am I gonna do!

09:35.050 --> 09:36.340
Bill. Get in.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.709
Huh? What's going on?

09:42.710 --> 09:45.339
The extra weight
is throwing me off course!

09:45.340 --> 09:46.419
- Dad!
- Hang on!

09:46.420 --> 09:48.129
[Greens] Whoaaa!

09:48.130 --> 09:50.300
[Cricket] We're headed straight
for Big City!

09:51.630 --> 09:53.009
[screaming]

09:53.010 --> 09:54.669
How are we gonna get
out of this one?!

09:54.670 --> 09:56.629
Bill. You have helped me
understand

09:56.630 --> 09:58.629
that families must stick
together.

09:58.630 --> 10:00.459
Now, let me help you.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.749
- After all, I am here to serve.
- Whoaaa!

10:02.750 --> 10:04.960
Yay, Dad! What?!

10:06.710 --> 10:09.959
[Greens] Aaaaaah!

10:09.960 --> 10:11.339
[Vrum]
Goodbye, Greens!

10:11.340 --> 10:13.589
[Gwendolyn]
Mars here I come!

10:13.590 --> 10:16.049
Have fun on Mars,
Dr. Bubblebutt!

10:16.050 --> 10:18.129
We did it!
The Kludge is back!

10:18.130 --> 10:21.169
Oh, family, I love ya,
and the Kludge, too!

10:21.170 --> 10:23.629
[Kludge gurgling]
I love you, toooooo...

10:23.630 --> 10:26.049
Oh, my gosh,
the Kludge can talk?!

10:26.050 --> 10:28.459
No, no. It's
just her leakin' oil.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.460
