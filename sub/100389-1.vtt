to meet the hero

00:30.291 --> 00:31.709
who saved Avenue 3.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.834

-(CHUCKLING) Yes!
-We're all heroes on this ship.

00:36.333 --> 00:37.375
What's your name?

00:37.458 --> 00:39.125
-Jade.
-Powerful.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.125
Powerful name.

00:42.291 --> 00:45.709
Okay, Captain Jade
has the bridge, everybody.

00:45.792 --> 00:49.417
Just in time to press the button
to clear the main thrusters.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.125
It's not connected
to anything.

00:51.208 --> 00:52.625
NADIA: This way, Captain Jade.

00:55.041 --> 00:56.291
Good morning, Iris.

00:56.375 --> 00:59.166
Surrounded by stars,
and yet still you shine.

00:59.250 --> 01:02.375
-Noted. Mr. Judd is indisposed.
-Oh. That's a shame.

01:02.458 --> 01:04.166
He's fracking
some merchandise ideas,

01:04.250 --> 01:06.583
-and he just hit gas.
-Did he say that?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.083
-Yes, he did.
-Of course he said that.

01:08.166 --> 01:10.083
So, you're hosting
the passenger breakfast.

01:10.166 --> 01:11.291
Your guests...

01:11.375 --> 01:13.125
-Is that Mrs. Rodriguez?
-It is.

01:13.208 --> 01:15.333
I met her yesterday.
Deaf in both ears.

01:15.417 --> 01:17.417
You could just say "deaf."

01:17.500 --> 01:19.792

'Cause I'm deaf in no ears.

You know what
you could talk about?

01:38.792 --> 01:42.583
We just set the record for
the biggest yoga class in space.

satisfied,

01:48.875 --> 01:49.792
you're wrong.

01:49.875 --> 01:51.667
Okay, all right,
can we just be done now?

01:51.750 --> 01:52.792
I'm done. Are you?

01:52.875 --> 01:54.166
-Yes! I'm done.
-Great.

01:54.250 --> 01:55.959
So, can we just say sorry
and move on?

-You didn't say you're sorry.
-Neither did you.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.166
You said, "Let's say sorry,"
but you didn't even say it.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.000
(SIGHS) Okay, well,
I'm sorry I ever married you.

02:03.083 --> 02:04.458
-Is that good?
-No.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.250
-Is that good enough
for you, Doug?
-I'm sorry I ever met you.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.750
Believe me,
I can't wait to never see

02:07.834 --> 02:08.834

02:14.208 --> 02:15.208
-You psycho!
-You zoom in--

02:15.291 --> 02:16.542
I zoomed in too much. Wait.
Right there!

02:16.625 --> 02:18.125
I bet you wanna rock that
like a bad banana,

02:18.208 --> 02:19.458
-don't you?
-Yeah. You know what? I do.

02:19.542 --> 02:20.792
And thank you for reminding me

02:20.875 --> 02:22.834
of all the hot banging sex
I had with him.

02:22.917 --> 02:25.500
-It was phe-no-me-nal!
-Oh, I'm glad you loved it.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.709
-Okay.

Save me a seat.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.166
Oh. Yeah, yeah, sure.
By the way,

02:31.250 --> 02:32.875

enjoy today's cocktail,

02:41.583 --> 02:42.792

I like to see folk take pride
in their work,

02:48.750 --> 02:50.583
even if some might call
that work "menial."

02:50.667 --> 02:52.834
Not me, though.
I value your labor.

02:52.917 --> 02:55.417
Uh, I didn't see the gloves.
Thanks. (SIGHS)

-Hey.

-I thought, uh--
-Yeah. No, no, no.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.041
I came up with a week's worth
of great ideas

03:00.125 --> 03:01.083
in, like, 11 minutes.

03:01.166 --> 03:03.583
Here. Uh, make what I say
on here happen.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.291
Who's my favorite captain?
Ooh!

03:06.792 --> 03:07.834
New idea.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.166
(ENGLISH ACCENT)
For fuck's sake.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.250
We'd sell more steaks

03:10.333 --> 03:12.208
if the restaurant
was completely red.

03:12.291 --> 03:13.917
That's science, probably.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.458
Uh, check that it's science.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.250
(SIGHS)

03:17.333 --> 03:19.125
Change restaurant lights
to red.

HERMAN JUDD:
(SIGHS) Yoga. So relaxing.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.417
And I'm not even bending.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.709
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
It's a yoga supernova.
They bend so we don't have to.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.041
Does yoga burn
a lot of calories?

03:30.125 --> 03:31.792
Because we're losing profits
in the food court.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.500
Can they, like, move more?

03:33.583 --> 03:34.875
-IRIS KIMURA: Um...
-JUDD: Fast yoga?

03:34.959 --> 03:36.208
IRIS: Fast yoga?

03:36.291 --> 03:38.834
You know how old asteroids are?

03:40.250 --> 03:42.125
They're even more ancient
than this old astronaut.

03:42.208 --> 03:43.583
MAN: (OVER PA)
Final call for the asteroid.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.917
But they don't look
as good for their age.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.709
Look at that piston, huh?

03:47.792 --> 03:49.917
He's been checked, right?
The old guy?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.333
-To work with kids?
-The ex-astronaut? Of course.

03:53.417 --> 03:54.417
Yeah, he's just telling them

03:54.500 --> 03:56.625
-about the...
-Oh! Oh, the asteroid!

a hot-ass rock comin'!

came back on Ave 2.

Uh, Ave 5 slingshot round Titan
is all on schedule.

-Uh, A-Okay. Although--

04:13.834 --> 04:15.625
Great, keep me updated
on the Titan fly-past.

04:15.709 --> 04:18.250

Enjoy the view.

director of Judd Galaxy.

hatch seal inspection all good?

04:26.542 --> 04:27.625
-All good.
-Good.

04:27.709 --> 04:29.458
As you can see, there's
a lot of technology here,

04:29.542 --> 04:30.667
but all-- Uh, trajectory good?

04:30.750 --> 04:32.542
-EMPLOYEE: It's good.
-Good. All you need to know

04:32.625 --> 04:34.166
is that it keeps
your loved ones safe,

04:34.250 --> 04:36.667
and keeps me on the coffee.
(CHUCKLES)

04:37.500 --> 04:38.709
Okay.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.667
KAREN KELLY: Can't we have,
like, forest or lake,

04:43.750 --> 04:45.333
or just, you know, space?

04:45.417 --> 04:46.375
It's been stuck on

04:46.458 --> 04:48.709
"heavy industry"
for two days now.

04:49.917 --> 04:52.125
-No, it's not changing.
-But can you fix it?

04:52.208 --> 04:53.417
I think he's trying, sweetheart.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.959
You know, we have
an observation deck.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.709
-Yeah, there we go.
-Oh! Okay,

04:56.792 --> 04:58.834
I have an observation
and we don't even need to go

04:58.917 --> 05:00.417
-to a deck for it.
-(MATT CHUCKLES)

05:00.500 --> 05:02.750
We paid for a space cruise.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.375
Well, okay. I mean...

05:04.458 --> 05:05.959
-you say "paid," right?
-(FRANK SIGHS)

05:06.041 --> 05:09.208
But it was your sister who paid
for a non-transferable ticket.

05:09.291 --> 05:10.375
-Now, I'm not saying...
-All right.

05:10.458 --> 05:11.834
-...you're stowaways. Right?
-Whatever.

05:11.917 --> 05:13.500
No. I hope you're not
saying that.

05:13.583 --> 05:14.625
MATT: No, Karen, look.

05:14.709 --> 05:16.834
When I was 19,
I would go to music festivals

05:16.917 --> 05:18.208
and I would sleep
in the porta-potties,

05:18.291 --> 05:20.625
so I'm not a stranger
to stowaway culture.

05:20.709 --> 05:22.875
-(FRANK STUTTERS)
-Okay, we're not stowaways.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.041
-MATT: Okay.
-She paid for a ticket,

05:24.125 --> 05:25.375
-she couldn't come.
-FRANK: Right!

05:25.458 --> 05:27.542
Foot operation.
Her little toe is enormous,

05:27.625 --> 05:28.750
bigger than her big toe,

05:28.834 --> 05:31.500
and I'm signed off with stress
from my office, so--

05:31.583 --> 05:33.000
Sorry to interrupt, um...

05:33.083 --> 05:35.000
Miss Ellis in 810,
she wants to know

05:35.083 --> 05:36.667
if we can move the guy in 811.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.917
Apparently,
his breathing sounds fat.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.667
Okay. Uh... Excusez-moi.

05:42.750 --> 05:43.709
Duty calls.

05:43.792 --> 05:47.750
But I would love
to disperse your irritation.

05:47.834 --> 05:51.875
And I would love to hear more
about Joyce's huge little toe,

05:51.959 --> 05:55.333
-so, uh... let's circle back.
-Okay, well, I will circle back

05:55.417 --> 05:56.375
in an hour.

05:56.458 --> 05:57.667
She will. She's very persistent.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.834
(CHUCKLES) Well,
I'm very absorbent.

06:00.709 --> 06:01.875

06:01.959 --> 06:03.458

06:04.458 --> 06:05.500
I don't know.

06:06.417 --> 06:10.583
Okay, let's go live
to Avenue 5!

06:10.667 --> 06:11.834
How much do these know?

06:11.917 --> 06:13.959
Uh, the civilians know
about the 26-second delay.

06:14.041 --> 06:19.125
Lovely. Mr. Judd, hello!
(CHUCKLES)

06:22.542 --> 06:23.333
Right.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.458
ALAN: While we wait
for the delay,

06:24.542 --> 06:26.542
why don't you...
give them the tour?

06:26.625 --> 06:29.083
Oh, why don't I...? Thanks.
Great idea.

06:29.166 --> 06:31.125
Oi. Russian. Wind it.

06:32.500 --> 06:36.709
Uh, that is an award-winning
atrium, in terms of design--

06:36.792 --> 06:38.166
Yes. Yes. Yes to that.

06:38.250 --> 06:42.291
This is the main dining area,
which is red for a reason.

06:42.375 --> 06:46.000
That is the spa area--
I can't deal with that now.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.041
To help you relax.

06:49.125 --> 06:52.333
There's even a soft play area.
Yay.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.208
I want one. (CHUCKLES)

07:04.625 --> 07:06.792
Why is she-- Why is she not
talking to us?

07:06.875 --> 07:09.166
-No, it's the delay.
-What are you talk--

07:09.250 --> 07:11.208
I thought you had a guy
outside fixing that.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.000
We do have a guy outside.

in being here.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.417
Uh... yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it is.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.583
That is very long.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.583
Oh, for fuck--
You can go-- You can go now.

16:56.834 --> 16:59.667
Stabbed through the heart
with his own screwdriver.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.208
Why's there no blood?

17:02.291 --> 17:05.000
Maybe it missed his heart,
and that's why there's no blood.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.583
Space is cold, Captain.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.000
You know that, right?

17:08.083 --> 17:09.333
Joe's blood is frozen.

17:09.417 --> 17:10.750
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

17:11.750 --> 17:13.792
Or it could've missed his heart.

17:13.875 --> 17:16.041
No. When it thaws, it'll--
Oh! (EXCLAIMS)

17:16.125 --> 17:17.917
-It's gonna do that.
You see that?
-Oh! Oh!

RAV: Hi. How are you all?

17:20.041 --> 17:20.959
Good. Pretty good.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.375
I have a little thing
with my knee,

17:22.458 --> 17:24.875
but I think it predates
the accident. Um...

17:24.959 --> 17:26.291
how are you?

17:27.959 --> 17:30.125
They're on a delay.
Don't forget.

their love and best wishes.

I think you're still talking...
-JUDD: I have a little thing...

17:47.000 --> 17:48.291
RAV: Could you repeat that?
I-- I think I've--

17:48.375 --> 17:50.208
ALAN: He says he's got a bit of
a chronic knee thing,

17:50.291 --> 17:52.417
-but he thinks he'll be okay.
-RAV: Oh, fine.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.417
JUDD: I can't do this anymore.
I can't do this.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.000
We need this fixed.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.250
IRIS: They're on a delay.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.500
I know that, Iris.
Rav's on the delay, not you.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.709
So, when you speak,
I hear it immediately.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.834
RAV: Okay, I'm just gonna talk
because of the delay.

18:06.917 --> 18:10.875
I've got some...  (CHUCKLES)
difficult news.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.125
Um, it seems you've been
knocked off course

18:13.208 --> 18:17.542
-by 0.21 degrees.
-JUDD: So, what-- what is that--

18:17.625 --> 18:19.000
-What's that--
-RAV: Which means...

18:19.083 --> 18:22.333
uh, the trajectory
has changed.

Sorry, ma'am.
No ID, no entry.

Oh, okay. Um, Dan. Hi.

18:27.083 --> 18:28.458
-Sorry, ma'am.
-I'm supposed to be in there.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.083
If you don't let me in,
that is a problem.

18:30.166 --> 18:31.709
-But do you have any ID?
-And it's a problem

18:31.792 --> 18:33.208
that will be raised
in the meeting

18:33.291 --> 18:34.500
that you are stopping me
getting into.

18:34.583 --> 18:37.041
You know, I don't have it
with me. You do, however,

18:37.125 --> 18:39.709
and I-- Thank you so much.
You're a sweetheart, Dan.

-Subject to change.
-What?

18:48.208 --> 18:49.667
I didn't need to be in there.

very positive.

Let's all take a second here,
all right?

19:00.917 --> 19:02.625

a few to play with.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.834
We've got this!
(CHUCKLES) Yeah!

19:04.917 --> 19:07.333
This may be the worst disaster
since Google folded.

19:07.417 --> 19:08.750
They'll figure this out.

19:08.834 --> 19:12.000
You know, they turned the moon
into a massive jail,

19:12.083 --> 19:14.083
they patented the liquid glove.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.250
How hard can it be
to reset a course?

19:16.333 --> 19:18.333
.21 degrees. That's, like,

19:18.417 --> 19:20.166
what, less than
half a right angle?

19:20.250 --> 19:21.959
How can that make us
three years late?

Um, me? Okay, so...

this way.

far apart?

-And it's further in reality,

19:36.542 --> 19:38.166
obviously. (CHUCKLES)

19:38.250 --> 19:40.417
Obviously, that's obvious,
right?

19:40.500 --> 19:41.375
See?

19:41.458 --> 19:44.041
No. No. That's wrong.
That's not right.

-Is it right?

19:46.291 --> 19:47.208
-Yeah.
-No.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.709

not to rectify the catastrophe
of human existence.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.250
So, worrying doesn't help,
okay?

20:13.333 --> 20:14.959
Because the way you're acting
right now,

this journey's gonna be over,

20:24.792 --> 20:26.000
and I'm gonna be home,

for three years.

It's only eight weeks."

24:49.208 --> 24:51.458
Joe, who hired me...

24:52.417 --> 24:54.792
because, well...

24:54.875 --> 24:57.500
I don't really wanna speak ill
of the dead, but,

24:57.583 --> 24:58.500
let's be honest,

24:58.583 --> 25:00.834
Joe's social skills were...

25:00.917 --> 25:02.917
I mean,
the man could barely finish.

25:03.917 --> 25:05.000
In terms of sentences.

25:05.083 --> 25:06.083
-Oh.
-RYAN: You know.

25:06.166 --> 25:07.333
I mean, he didn't like
the passengers,

25:07.417 --> 25:08.291
he didn't like the crew.

25:08.375 --> 25:09.834
-He liked you. Hated you.
-Really?

25:09.917 --> 25:12.291
Thought you were a flat-out
fucking nightmare.

25:12.375 --> 25:13.166
Fuck him.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.500
But if you wanna blame anybody,

25:14.583 --> 25:18.208
I'm afraid you've to blame
the guy who put me on Avenue 3.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.083
-Joe?
-Still dead.

25:20.166 --> 25:22.125
Well, Billie's next in line.

25:22.208 --> 25:23.959
(SCOFFS) Okay,
it's not a throne.

25:24.709 --> 25:26.208
Okay. So, here's the thing:

25:26.291 --> 25:28.375
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
I'm going to assemble the crew,

25:28.458 --> 25:30.583
and do some reassurance
on them.

25:35.625 --> 25:36.875
Stand easy.

25:36.959 --> 25:38.458
Nadia, systems update.

25:38.542 --> 25:39.709
All systems are nominal,
sir.

25:39.792 --> 25:41.959
Mads, orbital dynamics?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.750
Also nominal, sir.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.834
Hey, Leah, you're gonna
wanna hear this. Join me.

25:45.917 --> 25:47.041
You guys know what's going on?

25:47.125 --> 25:48.333
(SCOFFS) I would've asked
the captain,

25:48.417 --> 25:50.250
but I'm not allowed
in case he gets me pregnant.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.083
Fall in if you wanna
find out more.

25:52.166 --> 25:55.083
All secondary circuits
are clear. Code green.

25:55.166 --> 25:57.291
-He knows his stuff.
-No, he doesn't.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.291
-He really doesn't.
-Oh, no.

25:59.375 --> 26:01.625
No, no. He doesn't.
I forgot.

26:01.709 --> 26:02.750
(BILLIE SIGHS)

26:02.834 --> 26:04.333
But, you know,
in difficult times,

26:04.417 --> 26:05.458
a crew, a real crew,

26:05.542 --> 26:07.291
needs to be the opposite
of oil and water.

26:07.375 --> 26:09.041
We cannot separate,
we have to--

26:09.125 --> 26:10.041
MATT: Sir.

26:10.125 --> 26:11.583
I hate to interrupt
a protracted metaphor,

26:11.667 --> 26:14.083
but this brilliant,
yet furious passenger

26:14.166 --> 26:15.500
would like to assign blame.

26:15.583 --> 26:16.792
It's not really a good time.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.959
-I know it's three years.
-What?

26:19.041 --> 26:21.291
I know we're trapped here
for three years.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.250
-Did you tell her?
-No, I told him.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.375
Bombshell.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.750
So, we've got an S-storm
brewing,

26:26.834 --> 26:28.083
and this A-hole

26:28.166 --> 26:29.208
-is not helping.
-Me.

26:29.291 --> 26:30.917
I need you to talk
to the passengers

26:31.000 --> 26:32.417
before anybody else finds out,

26:32.500 --> 26:34.417
and explain how
you're gonna fix this

26:34.500 --> 26:35.667
like you fixed Avenue 3.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.041
W-- Huh.

26:37.125 --> 26:40.041
As I have stressed, repeatedly,
it was actually the sprinklers

26:40.125 --> 26:42.000
that-- that did most of the,
uh--

26:42.083 --> 26:43.333
It was the damn sprinklers.

26:43.417 --> 26:47.125
I don't care. Are you gonna
talk to them, or am I?

26:47.208 --> 26:49.792
All right. Okay,
unless you wanna run the ship?

26:49.875 --> 26:51.834
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves!

26:51.917 --> 26:54.875
-She's my favorite.
-Is she? Uh-huh.

26:54.959 --> 26:58.208
-Fly safe.
-ALL: Fly true.

26:58.291 --> 27:01.583
Oh, there you are.
Let's talk.

27:01.667 --> 27:03.750
You've got a plan, right,
Captain?

27:03.834 --> 27:06.750
Just nod if words are
too difficult for you right now.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.792
No, I've got a plan.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.917
Just... go in there and smile.
Works every time.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.792
Do you like pancakes? I do.

27:13.875 --> 27:15.792
Why don't you order some
for breakfast

27:15.875 --> 27:18.875
-at Judd Yum on Deck Five?
-Hey, Jade. You got a plan?

27:20.709 --> 27:21.750
Worth a shot.
