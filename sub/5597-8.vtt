09:33.502 --> 09:35.803
Uh, 2003.

09:35.805 --> 09:38.139
Why would we want to read
articles from so many years ago?

09:38.141 --> 09:39.339
[Clears throat]

09:39.341 --> 09:41.976
You know, we're cancer patients,
not historians.

09:41.978 --> 09:45.046
Josh Lewis, professor
of 18th-century poetry.

09:45.048 --> 09:46.647
Or, well, I <i> was</i> until...

09:46.649 --> 09:49.283
Has the, uh,
has the nurse been in yet?

09:49.285 --> 09:51.752
No. It's hurry up and wait.

09:51.754 --> 09:53.821
Well, they have to
test our blood first, so...

09:53.823 --> 09:56.590
Yeah, make sure it's okay
to poison it.

09:56.592 --> 09:59.025
Yeah, the irony's
not lost on me.

09:59.027 --> 10:00.394
But, then,<i> nothing</i> about
this place makes any sense.

10:00.396 --> 10:01.595
I mean...

10:01.597 --> 10:03.664
I mean, I know...
let's get all the sick people,

10:03.666 --> 10:05.965
we'll put them in one place,
and then have them treated

10:05.967 --> 10:10.003
by some semi-socialized
beaker head with a God complex.

10:11.173 --> 10:12.906
Sorry. Didn't catch your name.

10:12.908 --> 10:14.174
Dana.

10:14.176 --> 10:16.762
But most people around here
call me Dr. Kinney.

10:18.214 --> 10:19.246
Dr. Kinney.

10:19.248 --> 10:20.180
Look at that.

10:20.182 --> 10:21.715
What's the news, Dawson?

10:21.717 --> 10:23.382
You're good to go.

10:23.384 --> 10:25.318
Let's get you started
on the docetaxel.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.053
Yum, yum.

10:27.055 --> 10:28.554
I'm a doctor, too.

10:28.556 --> 10:30.623
Doctor of old poems.

10:31.893 --> 10:33.727
You writing a book?

10:33.729 --> 10:35.128
Trying to.

10:35.130 --> 10:38.164
Thought I might have
at least one great novel in me.

10:38.166 --> 10:41.768
Although, now it turns out
it might have to be a novella.

10:41.770 --> 10:44.904
Or it might just be, you know,
a professional hazard.

10:44.906 --> 10:46.239
Teaching
all that great literature,

10:46.241 --> 10:48.975
making me think
I can do it, too.

10:48.977 --> 10:51.643
Speaking of
professional hazards...

10:51.645 --> 10:53.879
Doctor becomes a patient, huh?

10:53.881 --> 10:54.747
Mm.

10:54.749 --> 10:55.848
All done.

10:55.850 --> 10:57.449
You're next up, Josh.

10:57.451 --> 11:00.052
You guys need anything,
I'm your gal today.

11:00.054 --> 11:01.553
Thank you, Dawson.

11:03.791 --> 11:06.959
You know, it must be hard,
knowing all the facts,

11:06.961 --> 11:09.895
to still believe
you can actually beat this.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.366
I'm putting both of you under
at the same time.

11:14.368 --> 11:17.434
No food, no drinks,
so finish up your beers, boys.

11:17.436 --> 11:18.736
[Both chuckle]

11:18.738 --> 11:21.172
You ready to get off dialysis?

11:21.174 --> 11:23.074
Hell yeah, he's ready.

11:23.076 --> 11:24.876
We got a wedding to plan.

11:24.878 --> 11:26.343
So, we got transport on standby

11:26.345 --> 11:28.679
to take your kidney
to St. Donald's.

11:28.681 --> 11:31.916
Dr. Reid will be with you
shortly.

11:34.220 --> 11:35.218
You ready, Erin?

11:35.220 --> 11:37.154
Erin: My twins turn 7 next week.

11:37.156 --> 11:39.722
I've been on dialysis
since they were 4 years old.

11:39.724 --> 11:42.058
So yeah. [Laughs] I'm ready.

11:42.060 --> 11:44.661
It's been a long road.

11:44.663 --> 11:45.695
Thank you.

11:45.697 --> 11:47.864
We're just waiting
for your donor.

11:49.168 --> 11:50.967
Larry's not big on cellphones.

11:50.969 --> 11:54.604
All he's got is this old flip,
and the battery's always dead.

11:54.606 --> 11:56.472
Well, time is
of the essence, Emma.

11:56.474 --> 11:58.275
He can't just disappear
like this.

11:58.277 --> 11:59.975
He'll be here, honey.

11:59.977 --> 12:01.644
Larry doesn't have time
for a lot of people,

12:01.646 --> 12:03.736
but his big sister's
one of them.

12:04.949 --> 12:06.849
Nobody can help an old guy
with a chair, huh?

12:06.851 --> 12:08.284
- Larry!
- Larry.

12:08.286 --> 12:10.687
Must've passed a dozen orderlies
schlepping this damn thing.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.488
You'd think one of them
would have lifted their finger

12:12.490 --> 12:14.357
before Liz Taylor here.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.491
Got your chair.

12:15.493 --> 12:17.527
Larry...

12:17.529 --> 12:18.795
They found a donor.

12:21.032 --> 12:21.964
What?

12:21.966 --> 12:24.066
I'm getting my kidney.

12:24.068 --> 12:26.368
The right donor came in
to trigger the domino chain.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.003
It is our lucky break.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.439
[Laughs]

12:30.441 --> 12:32.341
Well, I...

12:34.378 --> 12:36.045
I wasn't expecting this today.

12:36.047 --> 12:39.849
Well, yes, I know.
This is all coming very fast.

12:39.851 --> 12:41.616
But we need to move now.

12:41.618 --> 12:43.385
We'll get you into surgery
shortly.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.787
But, uh...

12:45.789 --> 12:48.823
I was just reading
this thing online.

12:48.825 --> 12:52.193
A guy gave his kidney,
and... and, um...

12:52.195 --> 12:54.996
He developed an unexplainable
appetite for pumpkin pie.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.298
Wouldn't eat anything else...

12:57.300 --> 13:01.102
Just pumpkin pie, pumpkin pie,
day after day.

13:01.104 --> 13:02.470
I hate pumpkin pie.

13:02.472 --> 13:05.240
Are you seriously
talking about pie right now?

13:05.242 --> 13:06.574
I...

13:06.576 --> 13:08.843
[sighs]

13:08.845 --> 13:11.946
I just need time
to process this, Emma.

13:13.350 --> 13:14.782
[Knock on door]

13:14.784 --> 13:17.385
Dr. Reid, Maggie sent me down.

13:17.387 --> 13:19.019
Something wrong, Dr. Reid?

13:19.021 --> 13:20.153
It's fine.

13:20.155 --> 13:22.155
Just try to relax.

13:22.157 --> 13:23.623
Excuse me.

13:25.060 --> 13:26.526
What's going on?

13:26.528 --> 13:28.528
It's the cadaveric donor.

13:28.530 --> 13:30.463
We lost the right kidney.

13:30.465 --> 13:31.698
[Sighs]

13:33.468 --> 13:34.701
How bad is it, Maggie?

13:34.703 --> 13:37.304
Maggie: Right kidney's
lost blood supply. It's a goner.

13:37.306 --> 13:39.072
Left one is hypoplastic.

13:39.074 --> 13:40.340
[Sighs]

13:40.342 --> 13:42.574
So, we are looking at
a small kidney

13:42.576 --> 13:44.476
with a crazy arterial network.

13:44.478 --> 13:46.512
Might be too many to anastomose.

13:46.514 --> 13:48.781
Well, Terry's prepped.
They haven't opened him up yet.

13:48.783 --> 13:51.083
What do you want to do?

13:51.085 --> 13:53.485
I promised four patients they
were getting off dialysis today.

13:53.487 --> 13:54.954
That is still the plan.

13:54.956 --> 13:56.655
Okay, we will
cut a piece of her aorta,

13:56.657 --> 13:59.058
use it to make an arterial cuff
around the renal arteries,

13:59.060 --> 14:01.360
and then we'll have one
in anastomosis instead of three.

14:01.362 --> 14:02.528
Okay.

14:02.530 --> 14:03.862
Go get ready for
the next harvest, please.

14:03.864 --> 14:05.063
Mm-hmm.

14:05.065 --> 14:06.664
Somebody page Dr. Bishop.

14:07.867 --> 14:09.867
[Inhales deeply]

14:13.851 --> 14:15.318
Alex: All right, ureter is free.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.419
Just the artery cuff to go.

14:19.144 --> 14:22.757
So, the weather's great in L.A.
why'd you come back?

14:22.759 --> 14:24.493
I tried
an emergency spinal corpectomy

14:24.495 --> 14:26.828
on a 15-year-old
car crash victim.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.130
Did they die?

14:28.132 --> 14:31.032
No. No, I saved her life.

14:31.034 --> 14:33.135
And I still got sued anyway.

14:33.137 --> 14:35.270
Wow. That is rough.

14:35.272 --> 14:36.338
Yeah.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.306
They had more lawyers on staff
than doctors.

14:38.308 --> 14:40.174
Suction.

14:40.176 --> 14:42.710
I wasn't getting any better...
Just safer.

14:42.712 --> 14:44.278
From everything
I've heard about you,

14:44.280 --> 14:45.679
caution isn't really your thing.

14:45.681 --> 14:47.148
The way you're working
those scissors,

14:47.150 --> 14:49.383
I'd say it's not yours, either.

14:49.385 --> 14:51.352
Okay.

14:51.354 --> 14:52.853
Here we go.

14:52.855 --> 14:54.188
Got it.

14:54.190 --> 14:56.224
Start perfusion
and get it ready for transplant.

14:58.228 --> 15:01.228
[Illyana humming lullaby]

15:03.000 --> 15:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:15.477 --> 15:16.943
[Humming fades]

15:16.945 --> 15:17.944
Kristine.

15:17.946 --> 15:19.045
Oh, hey.

15:19.047 --> 15:20.780
Have you, um, seen a, uh...

15:20.782 --> 15:23.183
Uh, yeah. I've seen her.

15:23.185 --> 15:24.851
I've been <i> hearing</i> her
all day, too.

15:24.853 --> 15:26.719
Yeah. I've been trying
to talk to her.

15:26.721 --> 15:28.287
No, she doesn't want to talk.

15:28.289 --> 15:30.322
I don't think
she wants any help at all.

15:30.324 --> 15:31.924
Okay, well, what does she want?

15:33.594 --> 15:35.227
[Clears throat]

15:38.700 --> 15:39.732
[Doors close]

15:39.734 --> 15:40.833
Uh, well,
what do you know about her?

15:40.835 --> 15:43.036
Uh... She's a trapeze artist.

15:43.038 --> 15:44.537
Her and her partner
took a bad fall.

15:44.539 --> 15:46.974
He managed to pull through,
but she's having her...

15:47.542 --> 15:49.475
harvested as we speak.

15:49.477 --> 15:51.243
Ohhh. That's so sad.

15:52.781 --> 15:55.414
I-I think
I actually know the song.

15:55.416 --> 15:57.316
"My pigeon home," it's called.

15:57.318 --> 15:58.517
It's a lullaby.

15:58.519 --> 15:59.585
- Lullaby?
- Mm.

15:59.587 --> 16:01.453
So she's trying
to put us to sleep.

16:01.455 --> 16:02.454
Not working.

16:02.456 --> 16:03.522
[Laughs]

16:04.659 --> 16:06.925
Well, it's a song
about reuniting.

16:08.396 --> 16:11.564
I think she might be trying
to convince someone to join her.

16:16.537 --> 16:18.103
When we met, I was the water boy

16:18.105 --> 16:19.771
for my high school
basketball team,

16:19.773 --> 16:21.807
and I got stuffed in a locker
after practice.

16:21.809 --> 16:23.007
Did Dan save you?

16:23.009 --> 16:24.309
[Chuckling] No.

16:24.311 --> 16:26.177
I was in the one next to him.
[Laughs]

16:26.179 --> 16:27.245
Sounds romantic.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.479
Oh, it was.

16:28.481 --> 16:30.215
Took three hours
till the janitor found us.

16:30.217 --> 16:31.583
What were you screaming, again?

16:31.585 --> 16:33.918
"My legs...
I can't feel my legs."

16:33.920 --> 16:35.353
Sounds hilarious.

16:35.355 --> 16:37.722
We knew if we could make it
through high school together,

16:37.724 --> 16:40.157
we could make it
through anything.

16:40.159 --> 16:41.926
So far, we have.

16:42.829 --> 16:44.829
Time to go in.

16:50.002 --> 16:52.002
Take good care of him.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.208
Joshua: Don't tell me you don't know
the story of Abelard and Heloise.

16:57.210 --> 17:00.244
No, but I have a funny feeling
you're about to tell me.

17:00.246 --> 17:01.812
12th century, Paris.

17:01.814 --> 17:04.481
Heloise is
this whip-smart student

17:04.483 --> 17:06.016
who wants the answer
to human existence.

17:06.018 --> 17:08.151
Well, that was
her first mistake.

17:08.153 --> 17:11.387
So she goes to study
with Pierre Abelard,

17:11.390 --> 17:15.023
who's the greatest scholar
in France at the time...

17:15.026 --> 17:16.992
About 20 years her senior.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.094
Nothing wrong with that.

17:18.096 --> 17:19.529
Well, it was
for her Uncle Fulbert.

17:19.531 --> 17:20.896
He found out about their affair,

17:20.898 --> 17:22.832
beat the living crap
out of Abelard.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.868
The lovers were banished
to live apart forever.

17:25.871 --> 17:27.704
They corresponded
by love letters

17:27.705 --> 17:29.939
for the rest of their lives.

17:29.941 --> 17:31.941
So? What do you think?

17:31.943 --> 17:34.645
Do you ever stop talking?

17:34.647 --> 17:37.180
Um... When I'm sleeping,
I guess.

17:37.182 --> 17:40.182
Oh! Well, then,
night-night, professor.

17:42.953 --> 17:45.087
[Breathes deeply]

18:03.441 --> 18:05.974
Oh, I'm sorry. You want one?

18:05.976 --> 18:08.310
Not unless there's weed in them.

18:12.115 --> 18:13.615
No way.

18:13.617 --> 18:15.249
Which part
of "I'm a poetry professor"

18:15.251 --> 18:16.685
didn't you understand?

18:16.687 --> 18:18.920
Well, then, what the Heloise
are you waiting for?

18:18.922 --> 18:20.780
Pass me a pot cookie.

18:28.732 --> 18:29.798
Mmm!

18:29.800 --> 18:31.065
Mm-hmm.

18:36.039 --> 18:37.939
Dr. Reid.

18:37.941 --> 18:39.440
Alex: Pali. What's up?

18:39.442 --> 18:41.709
I wanted to give this to her.

18:41.711 --> 18:44.345
Or to <i> him...</i>
whoever's donating to Erin.

18:44.347 --> 18:47.148
The donors are all anonymous.
I can't give you a name.

18:47.150 --> 18:49.650
I-I know, but the girls
made me promise

18:49.652 --> 18:50.918
that I would give it
to the person

18:50.920 --> 18:52.553
that helped their mommy
get better.

18:52.555 --> 18:53.721
Right.

18:53.723 --> 18:54.856
I will see what I can do.

18:54.858 --> 18:56.190
Thank you.

18:56.192 --> 18:58.925
You don't know what it's like
sitting there helpless

18:58.927 --> 19:01.261
while your best friend
just gets sicker and sicker.

19:03.398 --> 19:04.831
Of course you know
what it's like. You're a doctor.

19:04.833 --> 19:06.366
I...

19:06.368 --> 19:07.868
So you get why
it's so important to me

19:07.870 --> 19:09.102
that that gets to Erin's donor?

19:09.104 --> 19:10.403
Uh, yeah, just...

19:10.405 --> 19:11.404
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

19:11.406 --> 19:12.572
Is everything okay?

19:13.575 --> 19:15.242
Larry?

19:15.244 --> 19:16.743
Oh!

19:16.745 --> 19:18.544
Where are you going?

19:18.546 --> 19:19.846
Home.

19:21.016 --> 19:22.781
What? Why?

19:25.052 --> 19:27.152
I'm not doing it.

19:27.154 --> 19:29.621
I thought I was ready,
but I'm not.

19:29.623 --> 19:33.392
I only came in today
to drop off my sister's chair.

19:33.394 --> 19:35.694
Okay, I know that all of this
has been sprung on you,

19:35.696 --> 19:37.729
and you're probably
incredibly overwhelmed, but...

19:37.731 --> 19:41.566
All due respect, you have
no idea what I'm going through.

19:41.568 --> 19:44.370
I made a decision.

19:44.372 --> 19:46.605
I'm just asking you
to please respect that

19:46.607 --> 19:48.607
and leave me the hell alone.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.914
Don't let him
leave the building.

19:59.216 --> 20:01.057
- Berger is still in the building.
- What?

20:01.119 --> 20:03.319
That was Zach. He spotted him
pacing by the coffee kiosk.

20:03.321 --> 20:04.488
Which means he's waffling.

20:04.490 --> 20:06.189
Yes, which also means
we have until he gets to

20:06.191 --> 20:08.708
the bottom of his latte
to get him back on board.

20:11.930 --> 20:13.062
[Sighs]

20:13.064 --> 20:14.631
All right.

20:14.633 --> 20:16.332
I got this.

20:25.410 --> 20:27.277
Hey, Larry.

20:27.279 --> 20:29.379
Hi.

20:29.381 --> 20:30.713
How do you know my name?

20:30.715 --> 20:33.249
My name's Dr. Bishop.
It's my first day here.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.953
Congratulations.

20:36.955 --> 20:37.987
I'm leaving.

20:37.989 --> 20:39.188
Hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

20:39.190 --> 20:41.124
Just...

20:41.126 --> 20:43.159
Just hear me out...
Just for a second.

20:45.463 --> 20:47.195
I just moved back here from L.A.

20:47.197 --> 20:49.064
I was there training
under this Dr. Pearlman.

20:49.066 --> 20:51.566
Amazing surgeon. Genius.

20:51.568 --> 20:55.070
Also... a very pious man.

20:55.072 --> 20:58.173
And he taught me
a lot of things.

20:58.175 --> 21:01.977
Including this Hebrew phrase...
"tikkun olam."

21:01.979 --> 21:03.145
It's from the talmud.

21:03.147 --> 21:04.913
It means "repairing the world."

21:04.915 --> 21:07.449
Says all of humanity has
a shared responsibility

21:07.451 --> 21:10.085
to heal and transform the world.

21:10.087 --> 21:12.687
Why are you telling me this?

21:12.689 --> 21:14.822
Dr. Pearlman, he'd remind us
about "tikkun olam"

21:14.824 --> 21:16.890
before every surgery we did.

21:18.761 --> 21:21.762
Larry, I think you have a chance
to heal the world today

21:21.764 --> 21:25.666
in the simplest,
most pure kind of way.

21:25.668 --> 21:27.935
And I know you're scared.

21:27.937 --> 21:30.237
I get that.
I really do. I swear.

21:30.239 --> 21:34.075
But I think it's something
worth considering.

21:35.778 --> 21:37.311
And I don't think
you'd still be here

21:37.313 --> 21:39.113
if you didn't think so, too.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.530
My mind's made up.

21:49.074 --> 21:50.762
The answer's no.

21:52.127 --> 21:53.426
I'm sorry.

21:54.826 --> 21:56.079
No.

22:01.704 --> 22:03.504
So, there's these, um...

22:03.506 --> 22:04.437
Hm?

22:04.439 --> 22:06.473
Um, you know...

22:06.475 --> 22:08.408
You know... [Laughs]

22:08.410 --> 22:11.310
Double doors... the kind
that open in the center,

22:11.312 --> 22:14.246
and, um... But one of the hinges
was broken,

22:14.248 --> 22:17.850
so... they...
they kept that locked.

22:17.852 --> 22:19.385
[Chuckling]
But he didn't know that.

22:19.387 --> 22:22.187
[Both laugh]

22:22.189 --> 22:25.958
So, anyway, you know,
he's finally ready,

22:25.960 --> 22:27.527
and he's got, you know,
his tray of cheese,

22:27.529 --> 22:28.528
you know, it's just right.

22:28.530 --> 22:29.962
[Both laugh]

22:29.964 --> 22:31.263
And he's carrying it
like it's, you know,

22:31.265 --> 22:33.733
the most precious thing
in the entire world.

22:33.735 --> 22:34.967
And then bam!

22:34.969 --> 22:37.436
[Both laugh]

22:37.438 --> 22:40.672
His nose goes into the glass,
tray goes everywhere.

22:40.674 --> 22:42.707
There's, like,
honey all over his beard.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.044
[Both laugh]

22:45.046 --> 22:46.778
Oh!

22:46.780 --> 22:48.213
Oh.

22:48.215 --> 22:49.248
I've come unstuck.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.550
Oh! Whoopsie.

22:51.552 --> 22:52.684
Hang on.

22:52.686 --> 22:54.219
Oh!

22:54.221 --> 22:56.221
[Laughs]

22:56.957 --> 22:59.123
- What the...
- Here.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.925
Let me.

23:00.927 --> 23:02.560
[Laughs]

23:02.562 --> 23:03.361
Here.

23:03.363 --> 23:05.563
[Both laugh]

23:05.565 --> 23:06.797
Should you be doing this?

23:06.799 --> 23:08.732
Why not? Because I'm a...

23:08.734 --> 23:12.470
What'd you say? A beaker head
with a God complex?

23:12.472 --> 23:13.871
[Laughs]

23:13.873 --> 23:15.073
No.

23:15.075 --> 23:16.774
'Cause you're higher
than a lab monkey.

23:16.776 --> 23:19.777
[Both laugh]

23:19.779 --> 23:21.911
What is going on here?

23:21.913 --> 23:23.180
Um...

23:23.182 --> 23:25.048
Relax. Josh just popped his I.V.

23:25.050 --> 23:26.883
I got it back in.

23:26.885 --> 23:28.051
No, you can't do that.

23:28.053 --> 23:31.121
I'm sorry, but this isn't
your charge, Dr. Kinney.

23:31.123 --> 23:32.922
The hell it isn't.
I'm a surgeon.

23:32.924 --> 23:34.491
Not in here, you're not.

23:34.493 --> 23:36.159
Then what am I?

23:36.161 --> 23:37.794
I'm sorry?

23:37.796 --> 23:39.762
If I'm not a surgeon,
well, what am I?

23:39.764 --> 23:41.064
[Both laugh]

23:42.267 --> 23:43.800
A dead duck.

23:43.802 --> 23:46.368
That's... That's what he said.

23:46.370 --> 23:47.403
I didn't...

23:47.405 --> 23:48.972
That's what you implied.

23:48.974 --> 23:50.707
In here, you're just my patient.

23:50.709 --> 23:52.441
Right.

23:52.443 --> 23:55.812
So, what are my chances
of surviving this?

23:55.814 --> 23:56.946
Dr. Kinney.

23:56.948 --> 23:59.181
No, seriously.

23:59.183 --> 24:02.885
I have a reoccurrence of stage 3
metastatic breast cancer,

24:02.887 --> 24:04.821
so what are the odds
I'll be here...

24:04.823 --> 24:06.388
[Breathes deeply]

24:06.390 --> 24:07.456
By Christmas?

24:07.458 --> 24:08.357
That's not fair.

24:08.359 --> 24:09.492
You stay out of this.

24:09.494 --> 24:11.928
As your patient, Dawson,
I am asking.

24:12.931 --> 24:15.331
I do... I... I'm not...

24:17.401 --> 24:19.668
I don't feel comfortable
answering that.

24:19.670 --> 24:23.138
No. Of course you don't.

24:23.140 --> 24:25.206
I'm sorry. I'm...

24:25.208 --> 24:27.442
I didn't mean to be...

24:27.444 --> 24:29.011
You're all good now, Josh.

24:29.013 --> 24:30.646
Thank you.

24:30.648 --> 24:33.348
Okay, then. Um...

24:33.350 --> 24:35.884
I'll be back in a bit
to check on you both.

24:35.886 --> 24:37.352
Great.

24:43.994 --> 24:45.493
[Sighs]

24:46.714 --> 24:48.601
Where did you two meet?

24:51.168 --> 24:54.235
Uh... At auditions for cirque.

24:56.706 --> 24:58.506
Two total misfits.

25:00.677 --> 25:02.510
Her parents, Russian immigrants,

25:02.512 --> 25:05.313
kicked her out of the house
when she was 14.

25:05.315 --> 25:09.717
Mine... hardly even noticed
I was gone.

25:11.954 --> 25:14.589
She understood me.

25:14.591 --> 25:18.659
Yeah, I guess when you meet
someone like that...

25:18.661 --> 25:23.197
who gets you, quirks and all...

25:23.199 --> 25:25.632
nothing else really matters, right?

25:31.473 --> 25:32.806
Dr. Harris?

26:27.099 --> 26:28.048
Kurt?

26:28.428 --> 26:29.894
Let's get him back to his room.

26:29.896 --> 26:30.862
Okay.

26:36.703 --> 26:38.936
I don't believe it.

26:38.938 --> 26:41.639
It's my fault.
I pushed him too hard.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.374
It's no one's fault.

26:43.376 --> 26:46.177
He's never been very good
with surprises.

26:46.179 --> 26:48.545
When we were kids, I used to
jump out behind corners,

26:48.547 --> 26:49.881
and one time...

26:49.883 --> 26:53.350
She popped out, and I hit her
square in the mouth.

26:54.203 --> 26:55.887
15 stitches.

26:57.623 --> 26:59.323
I told you he'd come 'round.

26:59.325 --> 27:01.358
You were right.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.427
I <i> am</i> scared.

27:03.429 --> 27:05.196
I've been scared my whole life.

27:06.565 --> 27:09.533
You've always been
this golden child...

27:09.535 --> 27:12.135
Good grades...

27:12.137 --> 27:13.804
Good friends.

27:13.806 --> 27:15.939
We'll give you two some privacy.

27:20.379 --> 27:22.179
I've always been
this neurotic mess.

27:22.181 --> 27:23.880
That's not true.

27:23.882 --> 27:25.282
It <i> is.</i>

27:25.284 --> 27:28.352
Everyone thought it was a joke
when I said I would donate.

27:28.354 --> 27:30.587
But you stood up for me.

27:32.891 --> 27:35.058
We're in a good place, Emma.

27:37.029 --> 27:38.661
I don't want it to stop.

27:38.663 --> 27:40.297
It won't.

27:40.299 --> 27:42.665
You're my brother.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.901
That is never gonna change.

Ohhh, boy.

27:58.083 --> 28:00.950
Uh, hey, Alex, I need you
to come take a look at this.

28:00.952 --> 28:01.951
What do we have?

28:01.953 --> 28:03.085
A frozen kidney.

28:03.087 --> 28:05.655
[Sighs]
Larry put us behind schedule.

28:05.657 --> 28:07.323
It must have been too close
to the ice for too long.

28:07.325 --> 28:10.092
Even if we thaw that, we've got little
chance of getting it to perfuse.

28:10.094 --> 28:11.627
We've come too far
to turn back now.

28:11.629 --> 28:12.829
So, what do you want to do?

28:15.299 --> 28:17.233
Get me 10 bags of warm saline.

28:17.235 --> 28:19.435
And a blowtorch.

28:19.437 --> 28:22.171
Kidding! Hold the blowtorch.

28:22.173 --> 28:23.605
All right, then.

28:28.188 --> 28:29.740
[Sighs] That freezing
didn't do us any favors,

28:29.780 --> 28:32.190
but the warm saline flush...
It looked good.

You think it'll live?

make sure he's all right.

29:26.513 --> 29:27.779
You got it.

29:27.781 --> 29:28.880
Thanks, Bishop.

29:35.087 --> 29:36.053
How did it go?

29:36.055 --> 29:37.722
This is odd.

29:37.724 --> 29:38.856
What?

It was a stroke.

He's coning.

30:06.184 --> 30:07.850
The swelling
from the epidural bleed

30:07.852 --> 30:10.453
is pressing on his brain stem.

30:12.524 --> 30:15.358
There. That should relieve
the pressure.

30:18.229 --> 30:19.862
Alex, it's okay.

You can go.

30:51.460 --> 30:53.394
I haven't told her yet...

30:53.396 --> 30:55.529
That it's back.

30:57.833 --> 31:00.334
Toughest thing in the world...

31:00.336 --> 31:04.692
Watching your kid
trying to be brave...

31:06.075 --> 31:08.808
No matter how old they are.

31:09.679 --> 31:12.513
Especially when you know
the real truth.

31:12.515 --> 31:14.815
Yeah, I'd like to apologize
for that.

31:14.817 --> 31:17.550
No. Why? It's the truth.

31:19.087 --> 31:20.687
Okay.

31:22.390 --> 31:25.991
Then I say
we - we double down on this...

we got going here.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.629
[Chuckles]

31:31.165 --> 31:33.466
Let's tell each other one thing

31:33.468 --> 31:36.469
that we've never told
another living soul.

31:38.573 --> 31:39.572
Okay.

31:39.574 --> 31:41.407
Yeah?

31:41.409 --> 31:42.842
Who goes first?

31:42.844 --> 31:44.244
I don't know.

31:44.246 --> 31:46.112
You want to
rock, paper, scissors?

31:46.114 --> 31:48.147
Oh, careful. You're gonna
pull out your I.V. again.

31:48.149 --> 31:50.282
[Chuckles]

31:50.284 --> 31:51.717
I'll go.

32:00.795 --> 32:03.462
I don't want to do this again.

32:06.901 --> 32:10.035
I don't want to sit here,
getting sicker and sicker.

32:12.273 --> 32:13.692
I want to...

32:15.576 --> 32:19.043
I want to get on a plane.
I want to fly away.

32:23.016 --> 32:25.484
[Laughs]

32:27.888 --> 32:29.421
Your turn.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.195
Well, I want to come with you.

32:45.105 --> 32:49.239

32:49.241 --> 32:50.341
[Sighs]

32:50.343 --> 32:52.510
Well, look at it this way.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.011
What would you be capable of

32:54.013 --> 32:56.681
if somebody tried
to keep Alex away from you?

33:00.052 --> 33:02.252
So, how do we help her
if she won't talk to us?

33:02.254 --> 33:03.887
I don't know.

33:03.889 --> 33:05.690
You know,
maybe he doesn't see her,

33:05.692 --> 33:08.258
maybe he doesn't hear her,
but if he <i> feels</i> her,

33:08.260 --> 33:10.528
if he senses that she's here...

33:10.530 --> 33:12.162
Then what?

33:12.164 --> 33:14.864
He won't move on, either?
He won't get better?

33:14.866 --> 33:16.833
That's a bit of a stretch,
don't you think?

33:16.835 --> 33:17.934
Charlie.

33:17.936 --> 33:19.703
I'm just saying,
it's not very scientific.

33:19.705 --> 33:20.770
No, look.

33:27.813 --> 33:31.214
Illyana, you need to talk to us.

33:35.820 --> 33:38.187
He needs to be with me.

33:38.189 --> 33:40.622
It was <i> your</i> time. It's not his.

33:40.624 --> 33:41.891
You need to accept that.

33:41.893 --> 33:43.059
He won't make it without me.

33:43.061 --> 33:44.426
He's gonna have to try.

33:44.428 --> 33:46.795
I won't go without him. I can't.

33:46.797 --> 33:48.464
[Monitor beeping rapidly]
Something's wrong.

33:48.466 --> 33:49.832
Illyana, what are you doing?

33:49.834 --> 33:51.533
I love him too much.

33:51.535 --> 33:54.036
His heart rate's
through the roof.

33:54.038 --> 33:55.104
You need to go now!

33:55.106 --> 33:56.339
I can't.

33:56.341 --> 33:57.373
I won't.

33:59.911 --> 34:01.076
He's got a petechial rash.

34:01.078 --> 34:02.911
We need to get him to radiology
right now.

34:05.548 --> 34:06.982
Could be a fat embolus
in his lungs.

34:06.984 --> 34:08.984
Bone marrow may have seeped
out of the break and migrated.

34:08.985 --> 34:10.551
- Can you fix him?
- I don't know.

34:11.288 --> 34:12.320
Come on.

34:13.257 --> 34:14.522
Illyana!

34:14.524 --> 34:15.891
Stop!

34:18.728 --> 34:20.762
Call the code.
We need a crash cart.

34:20.764 --> 34:22.362
Look, Charlie.

Kurt never had a chance.

35:09.453 --> 35:11.117
I'm really not in the mood
to see the bright side.

35:11.170 --> 35:14.561
People who love each other
that much belong together,

35:14.640 --> 35:16.296
even in death.

35:16.388 --> 35:19.093
I'm not buying that. Sorry.

35:32.516 --> 35:35.050
I had a daughter.

35:38.756 --> 35:42.858
It was 4:00 in the afternoon.

35:42.860 --> 35:44.260
Not even happy hour.

35:44.262 --> 35:46.900
This guy's all over the road.

35:47.398 --> 35:49.165
He's coming right at us.

35:49.167 --> 35:52.634
[Voice breaking] I tried to get out of
the way, but there wasn't enough time.

so I could be with her.

36:12.052 --> 36:14.122
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

36:16.726 --> 36:20.094
When I woke up
in the hospital...

36:20.096 --> 36:22.030
She was gone.

36:22.032 --> 36:24.032
But there were
all these other spirits

that only I could see.

help each other, you know?

I'd like that, Charlie.

to come to Paris with me

this is the sanest thing
