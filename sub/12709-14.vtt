WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.403
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.436 --> 00:05.206
XANDER:
 You killed
 your best friend.

00:05.238 --> 00:07.807
Didn't work
'cause there wasn't
enough blood.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.544
BUFFY:
 Maybe that's what the First
 needed Spike for.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.246
We don't have time
to babysit a hostage.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.580
I'll be good.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.249
Apparently,
somebody left this

00:15.282 --> 00:17.016
in the courtyard,
and I was just returning it.

00:17.050 --> 00:20.553
-That's some full-service
principaling.
-I try.

00:22.455 --> 00:24.858
There's gotta be a reason
why the chip is going all wonky.

00:24.891 --> 00:28.629
This chip--
We can either repair it
or remove it.

00:29.896 --> 00:32.365
-Robson.
-Robson blacked out,

00:32.399 --> 00:34.268
but the last thing
 he remembers is Giles' head

00:34.301 --> 00:37.438
about to get real familiar with
 a Bringer's very sharp axe.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.573
It's started.

00:40.973 --> 00:43.610
I understand.
I'll take care--

00:48.481 --> 00:51.618
(head thuds)

00:51.652 --> 00:54.554
It was, uh, extraordinary
good luck, of course,

00:54.588 --> 00:56.624
and-- and training--
years of training.

00:56.656 --> 00:58.725
Chao-Ahn, keep up.

00:58.759 --> 01:02.295
You're new here,
Chao-Ahn, so take note.

01:02.329 --> 01:04.798
Remember about training.

01:04.831 --> 01:08.701
But I honestly feel
the largest part of it
was instinct--

01:08.736 --> 01:11.070
instinct and-and reflexes.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.375
There's a sort of
wary watchfulness I've
developed over the years.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.075
It's like another sense.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.245
(screams)

01:17.277 --> 01:18.111
Spike!

01:20.980 --> 01:23.584
-Hey, you're not in pain!
-Hey, you're not the First!

01:23.617 --> 01:26.052
-What?
-Anya said
you were the First.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.221
Said you were evil.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.424
You're supposed to be all...
go-through-able.

01:30.457 --> 01:33.326
Then what the hell did you
tackle me for, you berk?
What's that supposed to do?

01:33.360 --> 01:38.466
-I-- I didn't think of that.
-More importantly,
you just hit me.

01:38.498 --> 01:39.932
Why didn't your chip go off?

01:41.468 --> 01:43.637
Yeah, well--

01:43.670 --> 01:46.740
Well, uh, when we
were at the Initiative--

01:46.774 --> 01:48.308
-There was a choice.
-Right.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.677
To either repair the chip
or to remove it.

01:52.379 --> 01:55.216
You had it remo--
You removed the chip?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.685
Yeah.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.920
-SPIKE: Had to make a choice.
-BUFFY: It really is okay.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.522
-What's a chip?
-KENNEDY: They removed the chip?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.631
(theme music playing)

03:09.856 --> 03:13.661
-You know this is dangerous.
-You just heard
the horror stories.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.396
Wear hoops.
They'll catch on something,
rip your lobe off.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.300
-Lobes flyin' everywhere.
-That's not what
I'm talking about.

03:21.735 --> 03:25.538
You mean Spike
not having a chip.
Free-range Spike.

03:25.573 --> 03:31.177
I have to ask. What--
Why on earth did you
make that decision?

03:31.211 --> 03:34.747
I guess it was instinct.
Like you were talking about.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.718
(scoffs)
I made that up.

03:37.751 --> 03:42.055
I knew the Bringer was there
because his shoes squeaked.

03:42.088 --> 03:45.293
Look, Buffy, it's crucial
that we keep these girls safe,

03:45.325 --> 03:47.194
and I-I can't count
the dangers.

03:47.227 --> 03:51.031
The First, the Bringers,
random demons, and now Spike?

03:51.063 --> 03:53.266
-And the principal.
-What?

03:53.300 --> 03:57.871
Oh, nothing much.
He was in the school basement
holding a shovel,

03:57.905 --> 03:59.906
acting kind of evasive.

03:59.939 --> 04:03.644
Plus, he's got that whole
"too charming to be real"
thing going on.

04:03.676 --> 04:07.580
-I'm looking into it.
-That sounds
very responsible of you.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.384
Balances out the "vampire
on the loose" issue.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.919
Nothing's changed, Giles.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.323
Spike had a chip before,
remember?

04:15.355 --> 04:17.257
When the First had him kill
and sire all those people.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.961
We have no idea if
his chip was working then.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.130
A new chip might restrain him,

04:24.163 --> 04:28.235
should the First attempt
to activate him again.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.637
Spike has a soul now.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.238
That's what's gonna stop him
from hurting people.

04:32.271 --> 04:35.175
-Buffy--
-He can be a good man, Giles.

04:35.207 --> 04:38.778
I feel it.
But he's never gonna get there
if we don't give him the chance.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.754
Buffy, I want more for you.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.324
Your feelings for him
are coloring your judgment.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.223
I can hear it
in your voice.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.163
And that way lies a future
filled with pain.
I don't want that for you.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.064
We haven't--

05:00.000 --> 05:02.603
Things have been different
since he came back.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.105
It doesn't matter if
you're not physical
with each other anymore.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.809
There's a connection.
You rely on him.

05:08.841 --> 05:12.812
He relies on you.
That's what's affecting
your judgment.

05:12.846 --> 05:16.350
You think I'm losing sight
of the big picture, but I'm not.

05:16.384 --> 05:19.487
When Spike had that chip,
it was like having him
in a muzzle.

05:19.519 --> 05:20.553
It was wrong.

05:20.588 --> 05:23.524
You can't beat evil
by doing evil.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.992
I know that.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.028
Well, I hope you're right.

05:28.060 --> 05:30.096
You're gambling
with a lot of lives.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.915
Hi. Can I help?
You seem kind of confused.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.550
You aren't wearing
a green apron.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.420
Confused, but sort of
randomly observant.

05:53.454 --> 05:57.057
Sorry. I just mean,
you don't work here, right?

05:58.091 --> 06:00.192
No. Right. Just helpful.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.531
-I'm Xander.
-Lissa.

06:04.564 --> 06:07.767
And I guess I
could use some advice.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.002
I can't even figure out if
I've got the right kind of rope.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.738
That depends on what
you need it for.

06:11.771 --> 06:16.108
Something like functional
around the house or,
you know, recreational?

06:16.143 --> 06:20.079
By which I mean, for example,
boating or mountain climbing.

06:20.112 --> 06:22.716
Not for tying someone up
for sexy, funky fun.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.250
(chuckling)

06:24.283 --> 06:27.754
In conclusion,
rope can be useful
in various ways.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.290
I have a kayak.

06:30.322 --> 06:32.459
Again with the random.
I like it.

06:32.492 --> 06:36.028
Sorry. I need
to store my kayak.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.899
So I was thinkin' maybe I
could sort of suspend it from
the ceiling in the garage

06:39.932 --> 06:42.470
with ropes and a pulley
or a winch thing.

06:42.502 --> 06:45.237
Not a bad plan. You'll need
stronger rope than that.

06:45.271 --> 06:48.207
-Wanna have coffee
with me later?
-What?

06:48.240 --> 06:50.444
Oh, you're the only one
that gets to be random?

07:06.694 --> 07:11.363
Now, if I were a sign of being
evil, where would I... be?

07:22.009 --> 07:23.610
Buffy?

07:23.644 --> 07:28.115
-Uh, Principal Wood. It's you.
-You lookin' for somethin'?

07:28.148 --> 07:32.752
File folders
and mechanical pencils.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.988
I wanna write on a file folder
with a mechanical pencil.

07:36.023 --> 07:39.259
The supply cabinet
in the outer office
has those things.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.194
Oh. This isn't
a supply cabinet?

07:42.194 --> 07:44.697
My bad. Okay. Thanks.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.365
Hey, Buffy?

07:46.399 --> 07:48.435
Yeah.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.504
Um, what are you doing tonight?

07:51.538 --> 07:53.941
Preparing for tomorrow's
counseling sessions.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.675
No, really.

07:55.709 --> 07:59.079
Watching a reality show
about a millionaire.

08:00.648 --> 08:04.151
Well, then, I'd like
to take you out to dinner,

08:04.184 --> 08:06.386
if that's all right
with you.

08:06.418 --> 08:09.523
You don't have to. I'm certainly
not saying, "Come to dinner
if you enjoy having a job."

08:09.557 --> 08:11.692
(chuckles)

08:11.725 --> 08:14.394
I may have to make up a little
document saying I didn't just
say that and have you sign it.

08:17.096 --> 08:20.167
Sure. I'd be happy
to have dinner with you.

08:20.199 --> 08:23.836
Great. I'll draw up
the paperwork.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.015
So, he asked you
out to dinner?

09:09.048 --> 09:12.384
Yeah. Isn't that weird?
He's a principal.

09:12.418 --> 09:17.024
He's a young,
hot principal with earrings,
but he's a principal.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.860
Why do you think
he asked me out?
He could be interested, right?

09:20.894 --> 09:24.163
Yeah, sure.
You're a frisky vixen.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.067
Or it could be work related.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.336
-Could be I'm getting promoted
for doing such a good job.
-(laughing)

09:31.772 --> 09:35.542
Oh, right.
That-- That makes sense too.

09:35.575 --> 09:40.212
Or maybe he knows that I suspect
he's up to something, and
he's taking me out to kill me.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.582
Well, you'll have to dress
for the ambiguity.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.985
You know, it's not even that
he's acting that suspicious.

09:46.019 --> 09:49.956
It's just, there he is,
on the Hellmouth,
all day, every day.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.894
That's gotta be like
being showered with evil,
only from underneath.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.596
-Not really a shower.
-A bidet.

09:56.629 --> 10:00.067
Like a bidet of evil.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.203
Buff, if he's really interested,
are you... interested back?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.740
I don't know.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.278
He's good-looking
and he's-- he's solid,

10:11.311 --> 10:13.846
he's smart, he's normal.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.316
So not the wicked energy,
which is nice,

10:16.349 --> 10:20.019
'cause I don't wanna only
be attracted to wicked energy.

10:20.052 --> 10:22.690
Or what if he is wicked?
In which case, is that why
I'm attracted to him?

10:22.722 --> 10:26.693
I'm gonna wait for that
sentence to come around again
before I jump on.

10:28.828 --> 10:32.065
You know what? Yeah.
I mean, I think I like him.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.336
-And it'd be good for me.
-Right. Help you move on.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.340
Why does everybody
in this house think
I'm still in love with Spike?

10:40.373 --> 10:45.812
No, I meant move on from this
imposed super self-reliance.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.980
Let somebody get close.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.883
Oh.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.219
-Hey, someone's here!
-Guys, guess what happened?

10:52.251 --> 10:54.187
-Buffy got a date.
-No, I did!

10:59.259 --> 11:01.961
-Fine way to steal my thunder.
-BUFFY: Sorry.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.865
If it makes you feel better,
it's Principal Wood, and I think
he's aligned with the First.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.801
Also, like 10 years older
than you, right?

11:07.835 --> 11:10.738
-Which is like a hundred years
younger than your type.
-Yay!

11:10.770 --> 11:13.240
Someone who doesn't remember
the Industrial Revolution.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.408
I think they're gonna
end up making out.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.510
"Oh, Principal Wood,"
she'll gasp.

11:18.544 --> 11:22.014
-"I love your lack
of wicked energy."
-Watch it,

11:22.048 --> 11:24.484
or I'm gonna make you talk
about your new girlfriend,
who you hold hands with

11:24.517 --> 11:26.586
under the dinner table
and think we don't notice.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.154
How about yours, Xander?
Is she evil?

11:28.187 --> 11:30.758
Well, she's interested in me,
so there's a good chance.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.360
But I'm hoping for the best.
We're going for coffee.
She has a kayak--

11:35.062 --> 11:38.197
Dear Lord, I hate that mall.

11:38.230 --> 11:43.269
The shop assistants are rude,
and everyone in the food court
is sticky.

11:43.302 --> 11:46.005
-Looks like you
found her some stuff.
-Oh. Hello. Yes.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.274
That's gotta be rough--

11:48.307 --> 11:50.243
getting just, like,
pulled out of your home,

11:50.277 --> 11:52.245
being told you're
a potential Slayer,

11:52.278 --> 11:54.181
and not being able
to bring anything.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.716
Yes. And the language barrier
is-is formidable.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.052
I was concerned that my Mandarin
is a little thin.

12:00.086 --> 12:04.291
But as it turns out,
she speaks Cantonese,
which is thinner.

12:04.323 --> 12:07.059
But we muddle through.
And as I suspected,

12:07.094 --> 12:09.897
ice cream is
a universal language.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.470
What'd she say?

12:19.005 --> 12:20.941
She's grateful to be
in the land of plenty.

12:20.974 --> 12:25.778
Let's, uh, go and put
away your new clothes.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.951
Hey, Wil, think you can
do a computer check
on Principal Wood,

12:30.984 --> 12:33.552
see if you can find
anything out?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.754
Yeah, sure. Want me
to check your girl out
while I'm at it, Xan?

12:35.855 --> 12:38.225
Nope. I'm goin' in blind.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.427
I'm gonna be
an optimist about this.

12:40.460 --> 12:44.096
Why go lookin' for trouble?
If it's gonna find ya,
it's gonna find ya.

12:44.130 --> 12:48.201
"Getting the most out of your
new microwave." Hmm. Nice.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.004
(clears throat)

12:52.038 --> 12:55.475
"Clock, setting the--
page 3."

12:55.508 --> 12:57.777
You don't need a manual.
It's intuitive.

12:57.811 --> 13:02.014
There's a button marked
"Clock Set," for pity sake.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.582
What kind of a nerd
are you?

13:03.615 --> 13:05.952
No wonder you crashed
your jet pack.

13:05.985 --> 13:10.523
Oh. Get thee behind me.
I rebuke thee.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.524
Take that, the First!

13:12.558 --> 13:14.427
(sighs)

13:14.461 --> 13:16.328
Look, you monkey.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.967
Ooh. Ahh.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.037
It burns as it ineffectually
passes through me.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.806
I'm not corporeal, remember?

13:26.840 --> 13:29.142
Also, not a vampire, so--

13:29.176 --> 13:31.144
A cross?

13:33.913 --> 13:36.950
What do you want from me,
Jonathan/the First?

13:36.984 --> 13:38.518
I have an assignment for you.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.553
Um, I follow
Buffy's orders now.

13:41.587 --> 13:45.057
I'm redeeming myself for...
killing you.

13:45.091 --> 13:48.294
-I mean, for killing Jonathan.
-Really?

13:48.327 --> 13:51.730
Why, so you
can earn a spot
on her little pep squad?

13:51.764 --> 13:54.667
You think she'll
ever let you in?
You're a murderer.

13:54.701 --> 13:58.337
Confidentially, a lot of
her people are murderers.

13:58.370 --> 14:02.075
-Uh, Anya and Willow
and Spike.
-Interesting.

14:02.109 --> 14:05.378
And you're the only one
she makes seek redemption.

14:05.412 --> 14:09.316
-Does that seem fair to you?
-I guess not.

14:09.349 --> 14:13.419
-You know we're headed
toward a fight, don't you?
-Yeah.

14:13.452 --> 14:16.655
What do you think the world's
gonna be like after that?

14:16.688 --> 14:20.326
News flash.
There's not gonna be
a Slayer gang anymore,

14:20.360 --> 14:23.529
but there is
going to be evil.

14:23.562 --> 14:26.732
And as long as
there is evil, I live.

14:26.765 --> 14:30.602
And as long as I live,
you can dwell at my side.

14:32.772 --> 14:35.575
-That sounds nice.
-And your assignment
won't be hard.

14:35.607 --> 14:38.544
-They're just little girls.
-You want me to hurt the girls?

14:38.577 --> 14:41.048
Uh, no, not all of them.
Not Dawn,

14:41.081 --> 14:44.017
not Anya, not Willow,
not your friend Buffy.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.518
Just the potential Slayers.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.456
That's-- That's horrible!

14:49.489 --> 14:52.960
I'm-- I'm gonna scream
and-- and get Buffy in here.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.695
She can't see me.
I'll still be here,
and I'm gonna keep talking

14:55.727 --> 14:58.597
till you hear
what I have to say,
so listen up, okay?

14:58.630 --> 15:01.600
The girls must die.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.639
I could never do that.

15:07.673 --> 15:10.610
All those girls,
all that blood.

15:10.643 --> 15:14.447
-I-I didn't like
the stabbing before.
-You don't have to stab.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.115
This'll be easy.

15:16.149 --> 15:19.251
Andrew, I want you to think.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.254
Willow brought something
to this house.

15:21.288 --> 15:25.091
Something good.
Something you can use.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.326
The new microwave?

15:28.461 --> 15:29.495
The gun.

15:31.697 --> 15:36.036
I want you to think hard.
Where did they put the gun?

15:37.269 --> 15:38.437
Hmm.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.678
I don't think
it's really a date.
That's what I think.

15:46.712 --> 15:50.116
Well, it is unclear.
That's why I chose
a top that says,

15:50.149 --> 15:54.754
"I'm comfortable in
a stodgy office,
or a swingin' casual setting,

15:54.787 --> 15:56.123
or killing you,
you know, if you're a demon."

15:56.155 --> 15:59.192
It also says, "I sometimes
get blood on my shoulder."

15:59.225 --> 16:01.427
Or it might be pizza.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.663
-I don't think
I can fix it.
-Thanks for trying.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.667
I wasn't talking about
your date anyway.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.270
I was talking about
the sham date of Xander's.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.373
I think it's part of a plan
to make me jealous.

16:13.405 --> 16:16.975
-Well, it's not working.
-Are you nuts?
Of course it's working.

16:17.009 --> 16:20.947
Observe my-my bitter ranting.
Hear the shrill edge
of hysteria in my voice.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.217
Uh-huh. Um, I should really
go find something else to wear.

16:25.251 --> 16:28.721
Fine. Go.
Leave me here to stew
in my impotent rage.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.159
Well, I--

16:33.192 --> 16:35.927
I'm also gonna pee,
so you should probably go.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.442
You look nice.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.979
Oh. Thanks.

16:53.011 --> 16:55.215
Traditionally, one wears
something over this.

16:56.749 --> 17:00.586
-Heard you got a date.
-Well, it's unclear.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.755
I mean, I have this
whole theory about a promotion.
Or he's evil.

17:03.789 --> 17:07.594
-Buffy, I'm all right.
-You don't have to--

17:07.626 --> 17:11.498
What? Be noble?
I'm not. Really, I'm all right.

17:11.530 --> 17:16.202
You think I still dream of
a crypt for two
with a white picket fence?

17:16.236 --> 17:19.070
-My eyes are clear.
-Good.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.772
I'm glad. Thank you.

17:23.643 --> 17:27.413
Never much cared
for picket fences anyway.
Bloody dangerous.

17:27.445 --> 17:31.218
You should try this too.
Uh, going out thing, I mean.

17:31.250 --> 17:35.355
I mean, there's that girl
you brought to Anya and Xander's
not-a-wedding.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.590
Oh, yeah, right.
There's always girls
who like the look.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.460
Bad boy, you know,
does it for some of them.

17:40.492 --> 17:41.993
Yeah, I can see that.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.833
I-I should go.
I don't wanna be late.

17:51.002 --> 17:53.905
(soft rock music playing)

18:01.314 --> 18:03.982
Lissa, hi. I was afraid
you weren't coming.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.252
You said 8:30, right?
Did you think I
was gonna stand you up?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.721
Well, it would be
kind of karmic.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.423
-What?
-Forget it.
I'm just glad you're here.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.460
You're gonna love the coffee.
Got myself a Red Eye--

18:13.492 --> 18:15.261
black coffee with
a shot of espresso.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.797
It's kind of rough if you're
not used to that sort of--
(stammering)

18:18.998 --> 18:19.999
It's hot cocoa.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.136
Well, sometimes
I don't sleep too good.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.673
I just lost macho points,
didn't I?

18:27.707 --> 18:31.344
Hey, who wants macho?
I like that you like hot cocoa.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.378
Red Eye, please.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.948
It sounded good.

18:35.981 --> 18:38.285
Yeah.

18:38.317 --> 18:42.288
Nothing? No records
or certificates?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.790
College transcripts?

18:44.824 --> 18:48.927
Looks like the only stuff
in the system about Principal
Robin Wood is super recent.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.730
Like since he moved
to Sunnydale.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.865
WILLOW:
I've Googled till I
just can't Google no more.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.469
He's not in there.

18:56.502 --> 18:59.105
Well, that's suspicious.

18:59.137 --> 19:02.375
Anya, calm down.
They're educational.

19:02.409 --> 19:06.011
-What's this?
-ANYA: Giles made them
for Chao-Ahn,

19:06.045 --> 19:08.146
and now she's locked herself
in the bathroom.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.817
There's other girls upstairs,
and they're starting
to complain.

19:10.849 --> 19:14.119
Those are flash cards.
I made them to facilitate
her training.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.721
Chao-Ahn never had a Watcher.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.857
-With the language problem--
-You showed her these?

19:18.891 --> 19:21.560
I wanted her to understand
the seriousness
of her situation.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.096
Holy crap!

19:25.597 --> 19:27.334
Perhaps I'll rethink
the approach.

19:27.366 --> 19:30.970
In the meanwhile,
you wanna help us get researchy?

19:31.002 --> 19:33.306
We're trying to invade
Buffy's date's privacy.

19:33.339 --> 19:37.042
-Buffy has a date?
-ANYA: Yes. Didn't you hear?

19:37.076 --> 19:40.680
Everybody has a date.
Buffy has a date.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.914
Willow's been completely
making out with this girl.

19:42.949 --> 19:46.085
-Hey.
-Xander's out with some
hardware store whore.

19:46.117 --> 19:48.721
It's Datefest 2003.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.224
Actually, Buffy's
investigating Principal Wood.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.626
-It's not a date.
-Really?

19:56.028 --> 19:59.231
-It might be a date.
-For God's sake!

19:59.266 --> 20:01.433
How can anyone think
about their social life?

20:01.468 --> 20:04.237
We are about to fight
the original primal evil.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.338
These girls
are in mortal danger.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.039
Didn't you see
the flash cards?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.644
This isn't right.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.089
-This isn't right.
-(laughs)

20:24.123 --> 20:26.792
I know it doesn't
look promising, but I
swear this place is great.

20:26.826 --> 20:30.128
It's the best-kept
secret in town.
It's just right down this way.

20:33.164 --> 20:37.537
Well, it is one of
the nicer dark alleys.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.940
-I promise you. It's just
a little bit further.
-Okay.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.911
(growling)

21:19.878 --> 21:21.614
-You set me up,
you son of a--
-(blows landing)

21:23.950 --> 21:24.884
What?

21:29.355 --> 21:30.722
(yelling)

21:53.045 --> 21:54.846
I guess we should talk.

22:05.857 --> 22:07.993
The restaurant's right there.

22:15.902 --> 22:20.038
-And you still have to see her,
like, every day?
-Yeah, but I guess that's good.

22:20.071 --> 22:24.510
How is that a good thing?
I mean, it seems like she never
lets you forget what happened.

22:24.544 --> 22:28.013
It's on her mind a lot right
now, I think, because our
anniversary's coming up.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.816
I mean, it would've
been our anniversary.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.983
And maybe I shouldn't be
allowed to forget it.

22:32.018 --> 22:36.021
I did--
It was a bad thing,

22:36.055 --> 22:39.025
and it hurt her real bad.

22:39.057 --> 22:41.059
And if you'd gone ahead
and married her,

22:41.093 --> 22:43.061
even though you had doubts,
that would've been better?

22:44.730 --> 22:46.898
-I guess not.
-Sounds to me like...

22:46.932 --> 22:49.868
in the long run,
you're both better off.

22:49.902 --> 22:53.405
I know it turned out good
for me. And that's what
really matters, right?

22:56.275 --> 22:59.445
I should've taken you
on a nicer date than this.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.548
Well, I can think of
something fun to do.

23:03.982 --> 23:07.019
-Thank you.
-This place is nice.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.722
-How the hell
did you do that?
-I've had a little practice.

23:10.757 --> 23:14.026
Never took on two at once
before, but I have taken out
a vamp here or there

23:14.059 --> 23:16.194
and some demons.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.932
-So, you're freelance?
-Mmm. Freelance.

23:19.965 --> 23:21.267
I guess that's
a good way to put it.

23:23.502 --> 23:26.605
-And you know who I am?
-You're the Slayer.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.576
Right. Okay. Um--

23:30.609 --> 23:33.412
So I'm guessing that
you don't work in an office

23:33.445 --> 23:37.983
15 feet above the Hellmouth
because you enjoy
educational administration?

23:38.017 --> 23:41.420
Well, I actually do enjoy
the work, but... yeah.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.422
Yeah, you're right.

23:43.455 --> 23:45.124
I maneuvered myself
into that school,

23:45.156 --> 23:47.326
that office, just like
I maneuvered you there.

23:49.127 --> 23:51.631
The Hellmouth draws
the bad things in close.

23:51.663 --> 23:54.901
And now we're headed
for something big, Buffy,
really big,

23:54.933 --> 23:56.935
and I need to be here
when it happens.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.305
I wanna help.

23:59.337 --> 24:02.808
So, you didn't hire me
for my counseling skills.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.848
They're valuable too.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.519
Wh-Why didn't you
tell me about you?

24:12.551 --> 24:14.921
I wasn't sure about things yet.

24:14.953 --> 24:18.857
-You didn't think
you could trust me?
-Oh, no, no.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.693
I wasn't sure I was ready yet--
ready to jump into this fight.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.931
And now you are.

24:24.963 --> 24:28.200
Well, now the fight is starting,
or is starting to start.

24:28.233 --> 24:30.469
And I don't have time
to worry anymore.
I have to do something.

24:33.404 --> 24:37.175
So, you knew who I was
before you even came here.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.211
Yes.

24:39.244 --> 24:42.413
How? How do you know
about Slayers?

24:43.549 --> 24:46.685
Right. Okay.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.689
See, when I was a little boy,
my mother was one.

24:49.721 --> 24:53.125
The one, actually.
 The Slayer.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.260
Your mother--

24:57.496 --> 24:59.632
Wow. I--I--

24:59.665 --> 25:02.734
I didn't know that
any Slayers had children.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.171
Well, I don't
know of any others.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.673
She was killed
when I was four.

25:09.675 --> 25:13.880
I still remember her,
but it's a little...
fuzzy, you know?

25:18.250 --> 25:21.753
Um, something got her?
A demon--

25:21.788 --> 25:23.489
A vampire.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.991
And, oh, man,
I went through this whole...

25:26.025 --> 25:29.695
avenging-son phase in my 20s,
but I never found him.

25:29.729 --> 25:32.832
So now, I just dust as many
of 'em as I can find.

25:32.865 --> 25:36.836
Figure eventually
I'll get him. That's probably
why we got jumped outside.

25:36.868 --> 25:40.205
I'm not very popular
with the bumpy-foreheaded crowd,
and I bet you aren't either.

25:40.239 --> 25:43.675
No. Not most of 'em.

25:43.710 --> 25:48.513
Um, so, do you have
any Slayer powers?
I'm sorry.

25:48.547 --> 25:53.384
I-- I'm just so floored.
I-I have no idea what to ask.

25:53.419 --> 25:56.021
No, I don't have powers.

25:56.055 --> 26:00.259
No, uh, super strength
or mythic responsibilities.

26:00.291 --> 26:05.064
I'm just a guy with
a few skills because her Watcher
took me in and raised me.

26:05.096 --> 26:09.234
So... you decided to tell me.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.170
That's right.

26:12.638 --> 26:17.143
In a darkened little
romantic French restaurant?

26:18.443 --> 26:22.114
Um, yeah.

26:23.515 --> 26:27.286
Yeah, I'm not really
sure how that happened,
but, yeah.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.391
Did you find the gun?

26:32.423 --> 26:34.393
Yes. It was in
Buffy's underwear drawer.

26:34.425 --> 26:35.728
She has nice things.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.395
-Show me.
-Well, I didn't take 'em,

26:37.429 --> 26:40.732
but there were thongs
and regular underpants.

26:40.767 --> 26:45.171
-Show me the gun.
-Yeah. Here.

26:45.203 --> 26:47.673
Willow tried shooting
Kennedy with that.

26:47.707 --> 26:51.109
Great. There's gonna be
panic and fleeing
when you start firing,

26:51.143 --> 26:53.412
so you're gonna have to
get 'em trapped someplace,
like the basement.

26:53.444 --> 26:56.582
And we're
killing them because?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.483
Because they're the future
of the Slayer line.

26:58.517 --> 27:01.854
When they're gone,
the line is gone.

27:01.887 --> 27:05.657
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Um, so why not have
Spike do it?

27:05.692 --> 27:08.160
-He's the one
with the trigger.
-It's not time for him yet.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.730
You can wait for
the next time they're training
in the basement.

27:10.829 --> 27:13.799
But don't just rely on
a locked door to keep them in.
You'll need more.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.702
Okay. Okay.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.271
Say, um,

27:20.306 --> 27:23.976
do you have any...
weaknesses I should know about,

27:24.009 --> 27:25.711
if I'm gonna work for you?

27:25.744 --> 27:30.215
Like, uh, Kryptonite
or allergies?

27:30.249 --> 27:33.051
-What are you asking?
-Oh.

27:33.085 --> 27:36.722
Nothing. Um, are you made out of
the evil impulses of humans?

27:36.756 --> 27:41.693
So, like, if everyone was
unconscious at the same time,
you would fade away?

27:43.095 --> 27:45.998
You're asking
a lot of questions.

27:46.031 --> 27:48.334
Yes, well--
(clears throat)

27:48.366 --> 27:51.738
I, uh-- Because--
Because I'm evil,

27:51.770 --> 27:55.875
and I wanna do
the best I can at that.

27:55.907 --> 27:58.477
So, I wanna...
(clears throat)
know stuff.

27:58.509 --> 28:02.681
Like, when--
when do we kill Buffy?

28:02.714 --> 28:05.317
Are you wearing a wire?

28:05.351 --> 28:06.919
-Oh!
-Wil, what's going on?

28:09.855 --> 28:13.424
You think you can
trick the First?

28:14.794 --> 28:17.596
You think you could
squirm free?

28:17.628 --> 28:20.031
I hold you, Andrew.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.768
I made you do this.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.538
Jonathan suffered.

28:27.573 --> 28:30.442
He was your friend
and he trusted you,

28:30.476 --> 28:34.613
and now he spends eternity
in pain because of what you did.

28:34.645 --> 28:37.282
No. What's happening to you?

28:37.316 --> 28:39.351
This is what
you did to him--

28:39.384 --> 28:42.954
took away everything he was
and left him like this.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.757
You started down
a road with that action.

28:44.790 --> 28:47.292
You have to keep going.

28:48.660 --> 28:51.697
Stop looking like Jonathan.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.266
You're not him.
You're the First,

28:54.299 --> 28:56.234
and you're trying to get me
to shoot innocent girls,

28:56.268 --> 28:58.203
but I won't do it.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.271
I'm good now.

29:00.306 --> 29:04.143
And when the fight is over,
I'm gonna pay
for killing Jonathan.

29:04.175 --> 29:06.412
You're gonna pay
for more than that.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.547
You know why?

29:08.579 --> 29:13.019
Because the biggest,
baddest First Evil
in the world's angry with you.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.890
FIRST:
You think this was smart?

29:17.923 --> 29:18.958
I'm hearing something.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.828
You think you can
trick me, women?

29:22.862 --> 29:25.163
It's not in the headphones.
It's out here.

29:25.196 --> 29:27.232
You only hear
what I want you to hear.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.801
You only see
what I want you to see.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.502
-(gasps)
-(screams)

29:32.971 --> 29:34.640
So many dead girls.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.376
There'll be so many.

29:39.846 --> 29:43.582
I knew it. See? I knew it.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.683
Thanks for your help
selecting the ropes.

29:45.717 --> 29:48.619
-The one I picked
wasn't strong enough.
-Yeah, that would've been bad.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.788
Listen, is this because
I'm friends with Buffy?

29:50.823 --> 29:52.590
-Who's Buffy?
-The Slayer.

29:52.624 --> 29:56.627
-You know the Slayer?
-This can't just happen.

29:56.662 --> 30:00.165
It can't just keep happening
that demon women
find me attractive.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.468
There's gotta be a reason.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.670
You just seemed like a nice guy.
That's all.

30:04.702 --> 30:07.605
-And I wanted to
get to know you.
-And kill me?

30:07.638 --> 30:08.974
Sure.

30:11.042 --> 30:14.980
-Do the ropes hurt?
-Yes.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.647
Good.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.717
So, we're thinking
it didn't go too well.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.854
-You should've let me
do this fast.
-No, no, no, I hate that.

30:21.887 --> 30:26.125
-Ow.
-You tried to record
the ultimate evil. Why?

30:26.157 --> 30:27.993
In a complex effort
to royally piss it off?

30:28.027 --> 30:30.162
Guess we succeeded
pretty good, huh?

30:30.195 --> 30:34.133
God, I never
should've gone in wired.
Redemption is hard.

30:34.165 --> 30:37.502
Getting back
to Spike's question,
why did you try to record it?

30:37.536 --> 30:40.205
-Ooh!
-WILLOW: To study it,
to see if we could

30:40.239 --> 30:42.540
figure something out
from what it was saying

30:42.574 --> 30:46.644
because, guys,
we have to face it.
We know nothing about the First.

30:46.677 --> 30:50.316
-Ow-ee. Ow. Ow.
-Well, we know not to record it.
That's something.

30:50.348 --> 30:54.720
Why did it appear to this one
then? I thought it was supposed
to be pulling my string?

30:54.752 --> 30:57.556
It said it wasn't time
for you yet. Ow.

30:59.391 --> 31:02.929
ANDREW:
I'm frightened. And my
chest hurts where the tape was.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.663
It's okay, Andrew.
You did good.

31:05.696 --> 31:08.400
-You stood up to it.
That's really amazing.
-Thank you.

31:08.433 --> 31:09.734
You're a peach.

31:10.936 --> 31:13.404
Yeah.
What did it want you
to do anyway?

31:13.439 --> 31:16.008
-Shoot all the girls.
-Shoot girls?

31:16.041 --> 31:17.509
Not you, just the Potentials.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.578
Oh. Well, that's
something anyway.

31:20.679 --> 31:23.548
-Something tragic.
-GILES: This proves my point.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.518
This time is crucial.
We should be circling the wagons

31:26.551 --> 31:28.420
instead of doing things like
going out on dates

31:28.453 --> 31:30.721
when gunplay is imminent.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.557
Willow, call Buffy,
get her back here.

31:32.590 --> 31:35.626
We need to dispose of the gun
and figure out our next move.

31:35.661 --> 31:36.627
I'll go get her.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.396
I'll call.

31:38.430 --> 31:42.634
-(ringing)
-Bet that's her. Sometimes
you're thinking about calling--

31:42.667 --> 31:45.070
No, it's a text message.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.973
Oh, it's from Xander.
It's one of our signals.

31:48.007 --> 31:51.143
-Signals?
-Yeah, the system
we set up a while back.

31:51.176 --> 31:53.444
Like codes.

31:53.479 --> 31:57.482
Uh, this one's either,
"I just got lucky.
Don't call me for a while,"

31:57.516 --> 32:01.153
or, "My date's a demon
who's trying to kill me."

32:01.186 --> 32:04.123
-You don't remember which?
-It was a long time ago.

32:04.155 --> 32:06.424
Well, if we play
the percentages--

32:06.458 --> 32:10.061
-Something's eating
Xander's head.
-Say, that's gratifying.

32:10.096 --> 32:13.965
-Buffy will know what to do.
-I'll go get her.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.734
That's okay.
We don't even know
where she went.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.003
(phone ringing)

32:20.338 --> 32:23.308
-That's not good.
-SPIKE: I'll go get Buffy.

32:23.342 --> 32:26.478
I could probably
still track her scent.
She'll be worried about the boy.

32:29.647 --> 32:33.085
Oh, my God! Mmm!

32:33.118 --> 32:36.688
Oh, my God!
That might be the best thing
I've ever had in my mouth.

32:36.721 --> 32:39.525
Isn't it good?
They soak the pears in brandy.

32:39.557 --> 32:42.927
Here. You need
a bite with the sauce.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.963
(chuckling)
Mm. Mm.

32:47.232 --> 32:49.468
What are you doing here?

32:49.500 --> 32:51.802
Is there a problem?

32:51.836 --> 32:53.638
It's Xander.

32:55.707 --> 32:59.677
Look, I-- I know what happens
if that Seal down there
gets all excited.

32:59.711 --> 33:03.382
I don't think you understand
what you're getting
yourself into.

33:03.414 --> 33:06.317
The Seal opens
and a vicious, feral
vampire creature comes out.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.686
Well, then you do understand.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.022
But what makes you think
that's, like, a good idea?

33:11.057 --> 33:13.525
The end is coming--
the final fight--

33:13.558 --> 33:15.527
and everyone is hearing
the drumbeat.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.729
It's telling us
to pick our partners,

33:17.762 --> 33:21.200
align ourselves with
the good or the evil.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.943
(screams)

33:45.223 --> 33:47.759
Couldn't have done it
without you, Xander.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.060
Thanks for the great date.

33:58.769 --> 34:02.673
-Are you sure he's
in the high school?
-Willow did a locater spell.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.843
-Useful stuff.
-I'm not surprised.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.577
That school's at
the center of everything.

34:10.547 --> 34:13.585
-How much longer
till we get there?
-Ten minutes.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.494
-So how do you two
know each other?
-He works with me.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.099
You know, in the struggle
against evil.

34:28.134 --> 34:30.436
Mm. Cool.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.445
Xander!

34:42.414 --> 34:43.282
Buffy!

34:59.465 --> 35:01.467
(groans, growls)

35:01.500 --> 35:02.833
He's a vampire.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.204
XANDER:
Oh, God, hurry.

36:02.159 --> 36:04.061
Hey.

36:24.715 --> 36:26.452
I think your friend's
gonna be okay.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.795
Hey, Xand, I'm here.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.766
So, how's your date going?

36:46.905 --> 36:50.342
Where are they?
It's after 2:00.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.744
I can't believe Buffy
hasn't brought him home yet.

36:52.777 --> 36:55.380
-His slut ate him up.
-His slut didn't eat him up.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.349
And besides, I thought
you were all angry at him.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.786
My feelings are changeable
but intense.

37:00.818 --> 37:05.023
I understand your fear, Anya.
I know fear myself,
'cause, you know,

37:05.056 --> 37:07.192
I, uh--I enraged
that primal force.

37:07.224 --> 37:10.094
-They're not back yet?
-I'm worried.

37:10.128 --> 37:15.199
I think we should go find them.
Xander could be injured
or trapped or eaten up.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.469
It is late. Perhaps
a little reconnaissance
might be helpful.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.742
She says she can't sleep.

37:24.775 --> 37:28.012
Um, I made myself
some warm milk.
You can have it.

37:32.483 --> 37:34.219
Oh, she's shy.

37:34.251 --> 37:37.021
They're back!
Oh, here they come!

37:38.188 --> 37:40.257
Is Xander all right?

37:40.291 --> 37:42.793
-Looks okay.
-Damn him.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.501
-What happened?
-What do you think happened?

37:50.536 --> 37:52.570
Another demon woman
was attracted to me.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.239
I'm going gay.
I've decided I'm turning gay.

37:55.273 --> 37:59.478
Willow, gay me up.
Come on. Let's gay.

37:59.510 --> 38:01.480
-What?
-You heard me.

38:01.512 --> 38:05.182
Just tell me what to do.
I'm mentally undressing
Scott Bakula right now.

38:05.215 --> 38:07.918
-That's a start, isn't it?
-(sighs)

38:07.952 --> 38:09.788
-Captain Archer.
-XANDER: Come on.

38:09.820 --> 38:12.257
Let's get this gay show
on the gay road.
Help me out here.

38:12.289 --> 38:14.460
What if you just start
attracting male demons?

38:14.492 --> 38:17.262
(chuckles)
Clem always liked you.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.664
-Serve you right.
-Children, enough.

38:19.697 --> 38:22.032
-I'd need some
stylish new clothes.
-Oh, enough!

38:25.003 --> 38:28.440
Have you learned nothing
from tonight's...
assorted chaos?

38:28.474 --> 38:31.376
There isn't time
for fun and games and...

38:31.409 --> 38:34.413
quips about orientation.

38:36.047 --> 38:40.117
These-- These aren't a joke.

38:40.150 --> 38:42.186
This-- This happens.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.356
Girls are gonna die.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.324
We may die.

38:51.061 --> 38:52.931
It's time to get serious.

39:10.715 --> 39:13.251
Anybody tell you about what
happened around here tonight?

39:15.019 --> 39:17.054
Willow did.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.090
The First is back
in the mix.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.795
It, uh-- It talked
to the little boy.

39:25.896 --> 39:28.032
It said it wasn't time
for me yet.

39:31.769 --> 39:36.875
I should move out, leave town
before it is time for me.

39:36.907 --> 39:39.610
No. You have to stay.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.112
No, you've got another
demon fighter now.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.081
That's not why
I need you here.

39:45.282 --> 39:48.653
Is that right?
Why is that then?

39:50.320 --> 39:52.824
'Cause I'm not ready for you
to not be here.

40:02.900 --> 40:07.773
And the principal?
How's he fit in?

40:30.695 --> 40:32.429
You look good.

40:33.699 --> 40:35.567
You're not my mother.

40:35.601 --> 40:38.068
I give you a compliment,
and you don't say thank you?

40:38.103 --> 40:40.170
Did I raise you that way?

40:40.204 --> 40:42.940
You didn't raise me at all.

40:42.974 --> 40:45.043
Well, I was dead.

41:01.025 --> 41:05.931
So you're the First.
Why are you here? Why now?

41:05.963 --> 41:11.101
'Cause you've been coming up
in the world,
takin' the demons out.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.503
It makes a mother proud.

41:12.538 --> 41:14.472
Yeah?

41:16.842 --> 41:19.844
Well, think how pleased
she'll be when I help
take you out.

41:21.746 --> 41:26.918
Until it's time for that,
I've got no use for you.

41:31.757 --> 41:33.692
Would you like to know
who killed me?

41:37.596 --> 41:40.731
-I know you went
looking for him.
-You don't know anything.

41:40.766 --> 41:46.003
Is that right?
Well, you can check it out
after I tell you.

41:46.036 --> 41:48.373
Check the timing,
reread what the witnesses said.

41:48.405 --> 41:50.007
And the people
on the subway station--

41:50.041 --> 41:52.844
-Who is it?
-You met him.

41:52.878 --> 41:55.512
You know him.

41:55.547 --> 41:58.449
You fought at his side.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.786
Spike.

42:03.688 --> 42:06.291
Now, what do you say?

42:10.561 --> 42:12.429
Thank you.

42:20.405 --> 42:21.572
(theme music playing)

42:39.456 --> 42:41.259
Grr! Arrgh!
