00:02.109 --> 00:03.828
If you want to talk,
call me into AC-12.

00:03.830 --> 00:06.508
Why go to all that bother
when I'm only after a minor detail?

00:06.509 --> 00:09.508
The reason you took over a
hit and run.

00:09.509 --> 00:13.228
Gates was with a woman in a cafe.
You think she's his girlfriend?

00:13.229 --> 00:16.748
Well she doesn't
appear in his statement.

00:16.749 --> 00:19.789
She came to the station.
They talked. Something felt odd.

00:22.269 --> 00:24.029
Inspector Tony Gates,
do you know him?

00:24.030 --> 00:26.388
I met him
briefly at the police station.

00:26.389 --> 00:29.988
That's the extent
of your relationship?

00:29.989 --> 00:33.388
The coroner's set the date to reopen
the inquest in the Karim Ali
shooting.

00:33.389 --> 00:35.588
You're going to be asked to testify.

00:35.589 --> 00:38.388
The fire arms officers are saying
you sent them to the wrong flat.

00:42.029 --> 00:45.188
I am the senior investigating
officer on a double murder.

00:45.189 --> 00:47.828
That is proper policing son!

00:48.509 --> 00:50.548
Tony gave me
back the motivation.

00:50.549 --> 00:53.549
He's a good man. You remember that.

00:56.069 --> 00:58.029
Arnott's on to you!
I don't know how?

00:58.030 --> 01:00.708
The hairdressers. You might
as well have hung up a sign saying,

01:00.709 --> 01:02.468
"Launder your drug money here!"

01:02.469 --> 01:03.988
No, please don't do this.

01:03.989 --> 01:05.829
Hey! This is happening Jackie.

01:07.269 --> 01:09.388
Think Dot
and Morton are covering for Gates.

01:09.389 --> 01:12.308
He's got to be at Jackie Laverty's
right now! On my way.

01:12.309 --> 01:15.909
I'm a police... Huh. No!

01:52.829 --> 01:54.469
Gotcha.

02:41.549 --> 02:44.629
All right son, calm down.

02:48.149 --> 02:49.429
What's going on?

02:52.389 --> 02:54.528
I've checked all of the
ground floor.

02:54.599 --> 02:56.679
I got here a few minutes ago
to arrest her.

02:57.679 --> 03:01.799
Front door was open
and there's blood everywhere.

03:04.159 --> 03:06.719
We should look upstairs.

03:08.999 --> 03:11.999
What are you waiting for, Arnott?

03:16.719 --> 03:21.239
She's not up here,
there'd be a blood trail.

03:24.799 --> 03:26.999
My team.

03:33.599 --> 03:36.598
Well? What?

03:36.599 --> 03:38.798
Did you want to check
the bedrooms or not?

03:38.799 --> 03:41.039
Yeah.

03:56.559 --> 03:58.678
You should check the rest of these,

03:58.679 --> 04:01.239
I'm going to have a
look around the back.

04:15.159 --> 04:16.279
Everything OK, Sarg?

04:16.279 --> 04:19.878
Yeah. Round the back, quick as you
can, see if you can find her.

04:19.879 --> 04:21.999
Right, boss.

04:30.999 --> 04:33.279
Gates?

04:35.079 --> 04:36.358
Where is she?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.878
I know as much as you do.

04:37.879 --> 04:41.758
This was a kidnapping or a robbery,
a meeting, whatever.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.558
It went tits up.

04:43.559 --> 04:46.158
We're gonna start the door-to-door
and get the dogs out.

04:46.159 --> 04:48.278
No. You don't get to lead this
investigation.

04:48.279 --> 04:51.798
You don't tell me what I can and
I can't investigate, all right, son.

04:51.799 --> 04:53.759
No sign of her outside, Tone.

04:58.279 --> 05:02.558
All right, get door-stepping, Dot.

05:02.559 --> 05:05.359
Nige, lock off the house
and set up a cordon.

06:20.839 --> 06:24.198
DS Cottan. No, where are you?

06:24.199 --> 06:26.399
No, you're breaking up.

06:44.559 --> 06:46.838
Can I help you, DS Arnott?

06:46.839 --> 06:49.759
I think I can manage,
thank you, DC Fleming.

07:02.759 --> 07:05.118
Do this now, please. Dabs and DNA.

07:05.119 --> 07:06.758
Yes, sir.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.279
Oi, this is my crime scene,
not yours.

07:14.119 --> 07:18.679
Log him out, Deepak,
and don't let him back in.

07:20.839 --> 07:22.519
Please.

07:30.079 --> 07:32.718
Sorry, sir. So tell us, Steve,
what have you got?

07:32.719 --> 07:35.119
Jackie Laverty went
missing this morning. Missing?

07:35.120 --> 07:37.878
She was attacked in her home
and now there's no sign of her.

07:37.879 --> 07:39.797
She wasn't just hiding a
hit-and-run.

07:39.798 --> 07:42.079
I've believe she was
involved in money laundering.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.358
What and you think you can connect
Gates with all this?

07:45.359 --> 07:46.759
Call him in for interview, sir.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.519
Before he has time to work
out his story. I need one hour.

07:55.359 --> 07:56.878
Good morning, Rita.

07:56.879 --> 07:58.358
Morning.

07:58.359 --> 08:02.518
I need to talk to you
about a hit-and-run investigation

08:02.519 --> 08:04.079
that was taken over by DCI Gates.

08:05.119 --> 08:06.678
You're AC-12, aren't you?

08:06.679 --> 08:08.558
Yeah.

08:08.559 --> 08:10.558
See, erm...

08:10.559 --> 08:15.238
My union protects civilian support
staff from talking to you

08:15.239 --> 08:19.038
in case it causes undue stress
and anxiety.

08:19.039 --> 08:20.598
Sorry.

08:20.599 --> 08:25.078
I could always arrest you for
perverting the course of justice.

08:25.079 --> 08:27.799
Take a seat.

08:31.119 --> 08:34.399
When exactly did DCI Gates
take over the case?

08:35.759 --> 08:39.318
When the information
came through from County CID.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.678
What information?

08:40.679 --> 08:44.638
From Missing Persons,
about Mr Patel.

08:44.639 --> 08:46.598
The victim?

08:46.599 --> 08:50.918
When DCI Gates heard that Mr Patel
had been Jackie Laverty's accountant,

08:50.919 --> 08:53.438
that's when he took over the...

08:53.439 --> 08:55.359
case.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.078
AC-12 interview.

09:07.079 --> 09:11.278
Present Superintendent Hastings,
DS Arnott, DCI Gates,

09:11.279 --> 09:15.238
the Police Federation
representative DCI Alice Prior.

09:15.239 --> 09:18.598
May I, sir? Perhaps
we could postpone this interview?

09:18.599 --> 09:22.038
DCI Gates has only just learned that
a personal acquaintance

09:22.039 --> 09:23.798
is missing, presumed dead.

09:23.799 --> 09:26.439
He's calling her
an acquaintance now?

09:31.359 --> 09:33.398
Let's do this.

09:33.399 --> 09:36.438
As it happens, DS Arnott's point was
a good place to start.

09:36.439 --> 09:39.198
DCI Gates, how would you
describe your relationship

09:39.199 --> 09:40.799
with Jacqueline Laverty?

09:42.319 --> 09:45.078
Jackie and I knew each other
20 years ago.

09:45.079 --> 09:48.558
She was Jackie O'Connor back then
and we were engaged

09:48.559 --> 09:51.638
but she broke it off to marry a
businessman called Andrew Laverty

09:51.639 --> 09:53.518
and we lost touch.

09:53.519 --> 09:56.238
We were reacquainted some five
months ago.

09:56.239 --> 09:58.039
She told me
about her property business

09:58.040 --> 10:00.718
and that she was
after a head of security.

10:00.719 --> 10:03.678
She wondered if I might recommend
some recently retired officers.

10:03.679 --> 10:06.518
And I made the mistake of giving
her my card.

10:06.519 --> 10:07.878
Mistake?

10:07.879 --> 10:10.838
Yeah, she called me the next day.
And the day after.

10:10.839 --> 10:13.038
And the day after and the day after.

10:13.039 --> 10:15.958
She wasn't interested
in ex-officers.

10:15.959 --> 10:18.678
Jackie was recently divorced
from Andrew Laverty

10:18.679 --> 10:20.878
and she made no bones about

10:20.879 --> 10:23.518
wanting to pursue
a sexual relationship with me.

10:23.519 --> 10:25.999
And how did you respond?

10:27.199 --> 10:29.518
I told her that I was now a
happily married man

10:29.519 --> 10:32.238
with two young daughters.

10:32.239 --> 10:34.558
She wouldn't take no for an answer.

10:34.559 --> 10:36.918
And over the course of the next
few months,

10:36.919 --> 10:39.199
Jackie Laverty became my stalker.

10:42.519 --> 10:45.158
And did you report this?

10:45.159 --> 10:47.598
No, sir.

10:47.599 --> 10:48.759
Why not, DCI Gates?

10:48.760 --> 10:53.158
Because she's a good-looking woman,
sir. And we had a past.

10:53.159 --> 10:56.918
And there's no smoke without fire.
Is there?

10:56.919 --> 10:59.998
So can you tell me how you became
involved in the hit-and-run

10:59.999 --> 11:02.078
incident that Ms Laverty reported?

11:02.079 --> 11:06.398
Well, actually, sir, initially it
was reported as a stolen vehicle.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.797
It was only afterwards that the
vehicle was linked

11:08.798 --> 11:09.999
to the hit-and-run.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.238
Are you aware the victim
of the hit-and-run was

11:12.239 --> 11:14.758
Jackie Laverty's accountant?

11:14.759 --> 11:19.158
DCI Gates is entitled
to be questioned by an officer

11:19.159 --> 11:20.718
at least one rank superior.

11:20.719 --> 11:23.798
Are you aware that the
victim of the hit-and-run was

11:23.799 --> 11:27.078
Jackie Laverty's accountant?

11:27.079 --> 11:29.678
Yes, sir.
When did you act on it?

11:29.679 --> 11:30.799
And when did you act on it?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.678
What is this?
Keith Harris and Orville?

11:33.679 --> 11:37.279
It's all right, Alice.
Let them fire away.

11:38.559 --> 11:41.278
As soon as I became aware of that
information, I acted on it.

11:41.279 --> 11:43.439
So straight away?

11:45.119 --> 11:46.678
Not straight away?

11:46.679 --> 11:51.478
I was concerned about Jackie's
manipulative behaviour.

11:51.479 --> 11:54.678
But once I set that aside,
I acted properly,

11:54.679 --> 11:57.078
by attempting to arrest
her for manslaughter.

11:57.079 --> 12:01.318
She had a large house,
luxury cars, expensive offices.

12:01.319 --> 12:04.158
Didn't you ever wonder where the
money was coming from?

12:04.159 --> 12:06.238
She appeared to be a successful
businesswoman.

12:06.239 --> 12:09.238
And she received a substantial
settlement in her divorce.

12:09.239 --> 12:12.278
You had no idea at all there might
be some financial irregularity?

12:12.279 --> 12:14.638
Absolutely none at all, sir.

12:14.639 --> 12:18.278
DCI Gates, how did you come
by the information

12:18.279 --> 12:21.358
that Jackie had killed her
accountant.

12:21.359 --> 12:24.398
This is the critical piece
of evidence against your stalker.

12:24.399 --> 12:27.678
Surely you remember exactly
how you found out.

12:27.679 --> 12:30.358
DCI Gates was not prepared for this
line of questions.

12:30.359 --> 12:33.758
I request them in writing with
the statutory ten days to respond.

12:33.759 --> 12:37.199
Rita Bennett informed me,
the civvie support.

12:38.239 --> 12:41.198
I took a statement from Rita Bennett
prior to this interview.

12:41.199 --> 12:44.159
I wonder
if her recollection matches yours?

12:46.479 --> 12:48.239
DCI Gates?

12:49.399 --> 12:51.998
The information
came in from County CID

12:51.999 --> 12:54.478
regarding the identity of
the victim.

12:54.479 --> 12:58.118
That was three days after Ms Laverty
informed me about her stolen car.

12:58.119 --> 13:00.598
You should have a
copy of that statement.

13:00.599 --> 13:02.599
Yeah, I'll see to that, Alice, yeah.

13:04.399 --> 13:08.918
The information you've just given,
why isn't it in the computer file?

13:08.919 --> 13:11.118
Why... Your answers match
what Rita said

13:11.119 --> 13:13.878
and what she claims she entered
in the file but it's not there.

13:13.879 --> 13:15.478
Why not?

13:15.479 --> 13:17.679
She must be mistaken.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.158
You deleted it.

13:20.159 --> 13:25.118
Stop right there. We're all aware of
IT problems as a day-to-day reality.

13:25.119 --> 13:27.238
Have you any proof that this
file was deleted?

13:27.239 --> 13:29.079
We could impound the hard drive.

13:30.159 --> 13:33.238
The database can be accessed by any
computer from the mainframe.

13:33.239 --> 13:35.278
Do you intend to impound them
all, DS Arnott?

13:35.279 --> 13:37.599
Send the whole station back to
bikes and whistles?

13:37.600 --> 13:40.398
DCI Gates's relationship with
Jackie Laverty clearly affected

13:40.399 --> 13:42.198
his handling of the hit-and-run.

13:42.199 --> 13:45.238
It's inappropriate for him
to remain SO on her disappearance.

13:45.239 --> 13:48.078
I was not the problem, she was.
I went to arrest her.

13:48.079 --> 13:51.118
It's something that you should put
to Tony's superior officer.

13:51.119 --> 13:55.598
Well, I certainly will, Alice,
if he'll deign to respond.

13:55.599 --> 13:57.879
Can we go, please?

13:59.039 --> 14:01.238
DCI Gates.

14:01.239 --> 14:03.798
I have mobile phone records
relating to your account

14:03.799 --> 14:05.279
and Jackie Laverty's account.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.158
Sit down, please,
DCI Gates, sit down.

14:09.159 --> 14:10.999
These came over this morning, Alice.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.718
You'll see last week's authority
for the release of phone data.

14:14.719 --> 14:19.038
The most recent records are
consistent with your testimony.

14:19.039 --> 14:21.718
Calls and texts from
Ms Laverty directed to your phone.

14:21.719 --> 14:24.518
None of the calls answered by you.
One-way traffic.

14:24.519 --> 14:29.319
Go back a little further,
and you're calling her. Texting her.

14:30.399 --> 14:33.118
Would you like me to read an example
of one of the text messages

14:33.119 --> 14:34.999
sent by you to Ms Laverty
last month?

14:37.999 --> 14:39.759
DCI Gates?

14:40.839 --> 14:42.438
No.

14:42.439 --> 14:45.518
So, can you tell us

14:45.519 --> 14:49.279
your true relationship with
Jacqueline Laverty, please.

14:53.239 --> 14:55.879
We had a one-night stand,
for old times' sake.

14:57.519 --> 15:00.958
I wanted to end it
but she used it against me.

15:00.959 --> 15:06.278
Sir, I was protecting my family.

15:06.279 --> 15:09.718
Well, I think it's fair enough to
say that we have grounds to

15:09.719 --> 15:12.119
remove you from the case, DCI Gates.

15:13.199 --> 15:15.478
Fine, sir.
Fine. Thank you, DCI Gates.

15:15.479 --> 15:18.438
Where were you last night?
Hold your horses.

15:18.439 --> 15:21.998
It's a simple question. You don't
have to respond, DCI Gates,

15:21.999 --> 15:24.998
if it's too short-notice to
come up with an alibi.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.399
Let's leave it there, Tony.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.118
I went home very late.

15:28.119 --> 15:31.438
I didn't want to wake my wife,
so I slept in the spare room.

15:31.439 --> 15:34.438
But I couldn't sleep for worrying
about the case against Jackie.

15:34.439 --> 15:36.558
So that's when I decided to go
and arrest her.

15:36.559 --> 15:39.598
Witnesses? As I said,
I was careful not to wake my wife.

15:39.599 --> 15:42.398
So you didn't spend the night
with Jackie Laverty? No, I did not.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.718
Why didn't you call for back-up?
Back up, when?

15:44.719 --> 15:48.158
When you arrived, alone, and found
evidence of extreme violence.

15:48.159 --> 15:50.398
Well, I knew that my team
were en route.

15:50.399 --> 15:53.318
And when you turned up,
I assumed between the two of us

15:53.319 --> 15:54.638
we were up to the task.

15:54.639 --> 15:56.999
I had to climb over the gate.
How did you get in?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.878
How...
Did you climb over the gate?

15:59.879 --> 16:02.318
No, I, um...
Your car was parked on the drive.

16:02.319 --> 16:05.878
Either you climbed over the gate
with it tucked under your arm,

16:05.879 --> 16:07.519
or Jackie Laverty let you in.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.078
I opened the gate.

16:14.079 --> 16:16.358
What's the code?

16:16.359 --> 16:17.479
Tell me the code!

16:20.439 --> 16:24.198
It'll be on Jackie's contact
information.

16:24.199 --> 16:26.278
There.

16:26.279 --> 16:28.558
2366.

16:28.559 --> 16:30.959
I think we should call it a day.
Yeah, I think so too.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.478
Sir, I sincerely hope you don't
consider you have enough

16:33.479 --> 16:35.398
grounds to press for suspension.

16:35.399 --> 16:37.958
DCI Gates has been
extraordinarily co-operative...

16:37.959 --> 16:42.638
The last number on Jackie's account.
A mobile she called last night.

16:42.639 --> 16:45.318
07900024731.

16:45.319 --> 16:46.758
Who did she call?

16:46.759 --> 16:48.078
I got no idea.

16:48.079 --> 16:50.398
You weren't present
when she made that call? No.

16:50.399 --> 16:51.758
That's enough, Steve.

16:51.759 --> 16:53.599
Sir, DCI Gates has no criminal
case to...

16:53.600 --> 16:57.478
Forensic scene investigators
are currently harvesting
DNA and fibres from the house.

16:57.479 --> 16:59.598
Yeah, and they are likely to
find some of mine

16:59.599 --> 17:01.039
you know, from a previous visit.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.678
Because I'm not denying
I wasn't ever there.

17:04.679 --> 17:08.438
And, of course,
I was there this morning, with you.

17:08.439 --> 17:10.559
Interview terminated.

17:15.959 --> 17:17.279
No suspension.

17:25.239 --> 17:27.039
Thank you, sir.

18:29.199 --> 18:30.839
Tony?

18:47.119 --> 18:49.598
But you know AC are all over her.

18:49.599 --> 18:52.759
AC are all over everything
at the moment.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.278
Look, I've let you down.

19:12.279 --> 19:15.998
I had a relationship that's
compromised me professionally.

19:15.999 --> 19:19.079
But none of it, really,
none of it reflects on any of you.

19:21.719 --> 19:24.478
In fact, it makes your loyalty
all the more humbling.

19:24.479 --> 19:26.718
But a woman's missing,

19:26.719 --> 19:28.678
almost certainly deceased.

19:28.679 --> 19:31.159
And Chief Superintendent Hilton
is in the process

19:31.160 --> 19:34.798
of appointing another officer
to lead that investigation.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.639
And we will render that officer
every assistance, OK?

19:45.759 --> 19:47.758
Hi. DS Arnott.

19:47.759 --> 19:48.999
I called this morning.

19:50.039 --> 19:53.398
The glass found at the scene
is teeming with evidence.

19:53.399 --> 19:55.798
It's very moist.

19:55.799 --> 19:58.798
We sampled saliva
from around the rim

19:58.799 --> 20:01.478
and we got two high-quality
fingerprints from the side.

20:01.479 --> 20:03.598
The prints appear to be
from the same person.

20:03.599 --> 20:06.798
Initial assessment is they match
the control prints from the house.

20:06.799 --> 20:09.638
They're Jackie's? Yeah.

20:09.639 --> 20:12.279
What about the whisky bottle?
Sorry...

20:13.719 --> 20:15.398
No, nothing.

20:15.399 --> 20:17.199
Just Jackie's prints again,
you mean?

20:17.200 --> 20:19.999
No, I mean nothing.
It's been wiped down.

20:22.119 --> 20:23.598
Thank you.

20:23.599 --> 20:25.479
I'll be back for the DNA reports.

20:28.999 --> 20:31.838
From now,
our focus shifts completely

20:31.839 --> 20:35.638
to the double murder on Greek Lane
and the killing of Wesley Duke.

20:35.639 --> 20:36.718
So...

20:36.719 --> 20:39.119
Excuse me.
You better come quick, sir.

20:55.159 --> 20:57.319
Can't keep his nose out,
can he, eh?

20:58.799 --> 21:02.438
Hey, DS Arnott - kindly desist.

21:02.439 --> 21:05.478
I want this car impounded
as evidence.

21:05.479 --> 21:08.558
I want it cordoned off
and I want HIM kept away from it.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.279
Then get yourself a warrant.

21:23.719 --> 21:25.559
What are you looking for - Shergar?

21:28.199 --> 21:33.198
He wiped down the whisky bottle,
but I know there's a glass
missing from the crime scene.

21:33.199 --> 21:36.559
He took it cause it's the only thing
that proves he was there.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.918
Oh, now you're screwed, Tone...

21:39.919 --> 21:41.559
he's onto your George Michael CDs.

21:43.279 --> 21:44.999
We done?

21:55.839 --> 22:00.399
Find anything, Sherlock?
You're wasting your time, mate.

22:17.519 --> 22:19.278
A thorough search of the property

22:19.279 --> 22:22.118
revealed no clues to
Jackie Laverty's whereabouts.

22:22.119 --> 22:24.638
We did a ring-around
of local hospitals,

22:24.639 --> 22:26.959
no-one matching her description
has been admitted.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.078
We established a track
on her mobile phone - nothing.

22:30.079 --> 22:31.758
It's been switched off all day.

22:31.759 --> 22:34.398
That's as far as we got when
Gates was brought off the case.

22:34.399 --> 22:35.917
He fought tooth and nail to keep it.

22:35.918 --> 22:38.077
He knows what the forensics
are going to sound like

22:38.078 --> 22:39.799
in front of a jury
when the body's found.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.118
Whoever killed Jackie did it quickly

22:42.119 --> 22:44.278
and moved the body
without leaving a trace.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.958
It sounds like a professional job.
Maybe she won't be found.

22:46.959 --> 22:49.438
That whisky glass
is the only physical evidence

22:49.439 --> 22:52.078
that can place Gates
at the crime scene. What?

22:52.079 --> 22:55.038
The search on Gates' car -
it came over as desperate.

22:55.039 --> 22:56.758
He's the one who's desperate.

22:56.759 --> 22:59.478
I push him from the outside,
you push from the inside.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.678
He'll crack.

23:00.679 --> 23:03.039
Make him lead us
to that whisky glass, Kate.

23:17.239 --> 23:20.398
Forensics never found anyone's DNA,
except the two victims'.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.998
Professional crew then -
gloves, the works.

23:22.999 --> 23:26.198
The search never found any sacks of
drugs stashed under the floorboards,

23:26.199 --> 23:27.718
but there was residue.

23:27.719 --> 23:29.318
Very pure crack cocaine.

23:29.319 --> 23:31.157
Well, maybe they weren't
just muscling in

23:31.158 --> 23:32.559
on somebody else's territory.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.239
They were out-trading on quality.

23:35.479 --> 23:37.518
I want to get over to the alleyway,

23:37.519 --> 23:40.118
I want to familiarise myself
with Wesley's murder.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.118
Do you mind if I tag along, sir?

23:43.119 --> 23:44.598
Just give me a minute.

23:44.599 --> 23:46.879
DCI Gates.

23:48.479 --> 23:51.478
Jesus bloody Christ, we could
all go down the pan with him.

23:51.479 --> 23:52.639
Hey, he stood by you.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.718
Don't make out
he's some kind of saint.

23:54.719 --> 23:58.078
We all tick a box for Tony
in front of the top brass.

23:58.079 --> 23:59.999
Yeah, and we all know
which box you tick.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.438
Screw you, Nige.

24:01.439 --> 24:04.199
Wondering if you backed
the wrong horse are you, Dot?

24:13.679 --> 24:17.398
Whoever committed the murders at
Greek Lane knows we're after them.

24:17.399 --> 24:20.558
They couldn't have been
more blatant in showing
they're behind this one.

24:20.559 --> 24:21.919
So you think this was a warning?

24:21.920 --> 24:23.558
Well, maybe they're taunting us.

24:23.559 --> 24:26.158
A double murder behind closed doors
is one thing,

24:26.159 --> 24:27.279
this is a triple now.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.839
And they hung Wesley up there
for everyone to see.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.679
Sir, we've got CCTV in
for Greek Lane.

24:36.519 --> 24:38.518
There wasn't any CCTV on the street.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.519
Footage from nearby traffic cams.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.639
Get back to the station
and go through it, please.

24:44.640 --> 24:47.158
Yes, sir.

24:47.159 --> 24:50.599
Sir, who's taking over
the Jackie Laverty case?

24:53.239 --> 24:55.958
DI Ian Buckells. Why?

24:55.959 --> 24:57.998
Well, the whole station
heard Arnott accuse you

24:57.999 --> 24:59.759
of being with Jackie Laverty
last night.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.998
Arnott's got nothing on me.

25:01.999 --> 25:04.518
That's not what I meant, sir.

25:04.519 --> 25:06.118
You've lost someone close.

25:06.119 --> 25:08.399
I'm here, if you need to talk.

25:35.199 --> 25:38.078
Tony... Hey, darling,
I'm really sorry, about...

25:38.079 --> 25:39.399
I'm just glad you're OK.

25:41.159 --> 25:43.959
One of your team's been telling me
about last night.

25:49.879 --> 25:51.438
Hello, sir.

25:51.439 --> 25:53.759
Actually, Mrs. Gates,
I'm not on your husband's team.

25:53.760 --> 25:57.078
I'm in another department
that's taking an interest

25:57.079 --> 25:58.438
in last night's events.

25:58.439 --> 25:59.999
Where are the girls?

26:01.079 --> 26:02.919
They're at clubs.

26:04.239 --> 26:05.759
This is work, darling.

26:09.759 --> 26:11.679
Come on, Sammy.

26:13.199 --> 26:15.878
Thanks.

26:15.879 --> 26:18.398
Get out.

26:18.399 --> 26:21.118
Mrs G was relieved to hear
you were working last night.

26:21.119 --> 26:23.838
I wondered if you'd dropped in
for a nap in the spare room,

26:23.839 --> 26:25.558
like you stated in your interview.

26:25.559 --> 26:28.358
She explained the bed
hadn't been slept in.

26:28.359 --> 26:31.278
It seems there's very strong
circumstantial evidence

26:31.279 --> 26:33.478
telling me your statement is false.

26:33.479 --> 26:36.918
Circumstantial evidence -
that's the best you've got?

26:36.919 --> 26:39.678
I know you wiped down the whisky
bottle and moved the glass.

26:39.679 --> 26:43.038
That glass is hard physical evidence
you're an accessory to the crime.

26:43.039 --> 26:44.758
But it's evidence you don't have.

26:44.759 --> 26:46.199
I'll find it.

26:48.679 --> 26:51.718
You've got this one chance
to call your solicitor.

26:51.719 --> 26:55.318
Come to the station
and change your statement,

26:55.319 --> 26:56.519
before it's too late.

26:58.039 --> 27:00.878
I'm not going to do your job
for you, Arnott.

27:00.879 --> 27:03.678
If you want to take me down, you're
going to have to do it yourself.

27:03.679 --> 27:05.599
Now get the fuck out of my house!

27:12.959 --> 27:16.478
When you're in a hole, stop digging.

27:16.479 --> 27:17.838
For your wife's sake.

27:17.839 --> 27:19.199
For your daughters'.

27:21.679 --> 27:23.679
Get out.

27:25.159 --> 27:27.158
Nice house.

27:27.159 --> 27:28.598
Shame.

27:28.599 --> 27:30.199
Have a good day, sir.

27:32.199 --> 27:33.839
Thank you again, Mrs Gates.

27:48.679 --> 27:50.839
What the hell
were you up to last night?

27:55.839 --> 27:58.879
I'm handling a triple murder.

28:05.319 --> 28:06.478
He's AC-12.

28:06.479 --> 28:09.438
It's, erm, anti-corruption.

28:09.439 --> 28:10.798
Anti-corruption?

28:10.799 --> 28:12.198
Oh, my God, Tony!

28:12.199 --> 28:14.679
They've got nothing,
which is why he's so desperate.

28:14.680 --> 28:18.078
He's got something on you, though,
hasn't he? No, really nothing.

28:18.079 --> 28:19.439
Why's he round our house?

28:19.440 --> 28:21.199
Because he's a prick, darling.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.838
What are you going to do?

28:25.839 --> 28:28.558
I'm going to sort it.

28:28.559 --> 28:29.838
Can you?

28:29.839 --> 28:32.319
I can and I will.

28:35.519 --> 28:37.599
I promise.

28:44.719 --> 28:46.599
Jools?

28:50.399 --> 28:55.598
How dare you! No-one can ever come
between me and my husband.

28:55.599 --> 28:58.359
You keep away from this family.

29:04.359 --> 29:06.199
Hey...

29:07.519 --> 29:11.558
I've developed a rough timeline of
the night of the Greek Lane murders.

29:11.559 --> 29:14.398
Four hours before the murder.

29:14.399 --> 29:16.998
That's the unmarked car
carrying Dot and Deepak.

29:16.999 --> 29:20.358
They went straight into position
on Greek Lane.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.678
Skip on two hours.

29:21.679 --> 29:24.238
A Subaru is heading from Moss Heath
to Kingsgate.

29:24.239 --> 29:28.598
10 minutes later, the same Subaru
takes the same route.

29:28.599 --> 29:32.918
10 minutes later - same again.
He's driving circuits.

29:32.919 --> 29:37.518
Each circuit would allow him
to swing by the Borogrove Estate.
Where the lads are parked.

29:37.519 --> 29:40.078
I'll skip on two hours. That's Dot
and Deepak leaving the area.

29:40.079 --> 29:44.438
Five minutes later, here comes the
Subaru, round the junction again.

29:44.439 --> 29:47.998
No more circuits.
In fact, we don't see it again.

29:47.999 --> 29:52.958
And what have we got on the vehicle?
Registration belongs to
an identical make and model.

29:52.959 --> 29:56.958
They've cloned the plates.
They harvest the cars for the jobs
and then dump them.

29:56.959 --> 30:00.878
Let's get Patrol to be
on the lookout for
all vehicles with cloned plates.

30:00.879 --> 30:02.519
Yeah, I've already done it, sir.

30:04.439 --> 30:06.279
That's a good job, Kate.

30:10.919 --> 30:13.839
I want everybody in on time
tomorrow, please. Yeah.

30:27.439 --> 30:30.879
You dirty bastards!

30:31.879 --> 30:34.398
Thanks, wanker.

30:34.399 --> 30:35.839
Oi!

30:37.239 --> 30:40.398
Mrs Pilkington! Ryan?

30:40.399 --> 30:43.038
It's the police!

30:43.039 --> 30:44.319
Keely!

30:45.799 --> 30:49.838
Mrs Pilkington, it's
PC Bannerjee from Kingsgate station!

30:49.839 --> 30:53.279
Ryan was meant to come in
to give a statement this morning.

31:01.559 --> 31:03.398
What this time?

31:03.399 --> 31:06.678
We intervened in a street
altercation, Mrs Pilkington.

31:06.679 --> 31:10.599
Ryan alleges he was assaulted
by an elderly neighbour,
Mr Alf Butterfield.

31:13.879 --> 31:15.879
Can I come in, please, Keely?

31:22.759 --> 31:26.319
I checked at his school. They said
he hadn't been in all week.

31:27.879 --> 31:31.318
Keely, where's Ryan? How should
I know? This is serious, Keely.

31:31.319 --> 31:35.078
Ryan's failed to attend
for his interview.
What's it gotta do with me?

31:35.079 --> 31:38.158
Well, he needs to be
accompanied by a responsible adult.

31:38.159 --> 31:40.919
That's his social worker, innit?

31:42.159 --> 31:45.598
Well, if the little bugger's not
here, there's no case to answer.

31:45.599 --> 31:51.918
I'm sorry, Mr Butterfield. You've
already generated a crime number.
There's no room for manoeuvre.

31:51.919 --> 31:57.358
PC Larkin means either you accept
the caution or it goes to court.
Take the caution.

31:57.359 --> 31:59.478
Home in time for Bargain Hunt.

31:59.479 --> 32:03.758
Yeah, but that will mean you have
a criminal record
for a public order offence.

32:03.759 --> 32:08.719
But...? Criminal record? Well,
he... he's the bloody criminal!

32:09.879 --> 32:11.239
Fine.

32:13.959 --> 32:15.518
Have it your own way.

32:15.519 --> 32:17.918
There... there was a detective.

32:17.919 --> 32:20.758
Now she said she'd
take care of everything.

32:20.759 --> 32:23.518
Yeah. I wrote down her name.

32:23.519 --> 32:25.638
Ah, this is all her fault.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.399
There...

32:31.039 --> 32:33.119
Fine, show him in.

32:37.439 --> 32:38.798
Thank you.

32:38.799 --> 32:42.718
Sorry, Tony, sorry. Worst
possible timing. I've got to dash.
I only need a minute, sir.

32:42.719 --> 32:46.958
The interview with AC-12 puts us
in a delicate position.

32:46.959 --> 32:48.678
I thought it best to come clean.

32:48.679 --> 32:53.998
That's admirable but, really, I'd
rather let the dust settle before we
have a definitive conference.

32:53.999 --> 32:56.398
I'll have Sheila put something
in the diary.

32:56.399 --> 33:00.718
You weren't so shy about standing by
me when the Chief Constable was
hanging a medal around my neck, sir.

33:00.719 --> 33:02.519
Yes!

33:04.999 --> 33:10.198
Ah, ah. Ian. Tony, you know DI
Buckells has taken over the Laverty
disappearance? Yeah.

33:10.199 --> 33:11.398
Any news?

33:11.399 --> 33:15.558
We've got the dogs out, sir,
but there's no trace of the body
yet. That's disappointing.

33:15.559 --> 33:20.319
We're developing her
money-laundering as a lead. And...?

33:21.759 --> 33:25.398
Sir, we've had a major
breakthrough on the triple murders.

33:25.399 --> 33:30.278
You have? Yes. We should have
it cracked... two, maybe three days.

33:30.279 --> 33:33.118
I can take that to the
Chief Constable? Absolutely, sir.

33:33.119 --> 33:35.439
Well, that's excellent.
Well done, Tony.

33:41.399 --> 33:43.278
We should, er...

33:43.279 --> 33:46.198
Don't make any assumptions
about Jackie Laverty's fate.

33:46.199 --> 33:49.598
She was facing a manslaughter
charge. She could've
faked this whole thing.

33:49.599 --> 33:55.038
Right... She had the cash
and the connections to get herself
out of the country.

33:55.039 --> 34:00.518
Maybe her ex is involved. OK. Erm...
AC are talking
crap about that whisky glass.

34:00.519 --> 34:03.998
Don't make a tit out of yourself
chasing shadows.

34:03.999 --> 34:07.518
I've seen too many ambitious
young DIs looking up the ladder

34:07.519 --> 34:11.918
without realising they've stepped on
a big slippery snake.
Do you know what I mean?

34:11.918 --> 34:13.799
Good to see you.

34:22.559 --> 34:23.958
Sir.

34:56.679 --> 35:03.519
Patrol sighted a vehicle with
cloned plates on Moss Heath Road.
Back-up's ready to roll. OK.

35:05.759 --> 35:10.118
Mobilise Tactical Ops.
Full armour, we'll do risk
assessment en route, let's go.

35:10.119 --> 35:12.439
I'll call Dot.
Let's go, let's go!

35:20.159 --> 35:21.598
OK, mate.

35:21.599 --> 35:23.239
Dot's meeting us there, boss.

35:31.799 --> 35:34.999
'TO-20 joining.
DCI Gates joining.'

35:36.439 --> 35:41.398
Stand down. DC Fleming, stand down.
What are you talking about?
We're on a job.

35:41.399 --> 35:44.478
Do I have to arrest you?
Stand down, Kate.

35:44.479 --> 35:47.478
Fleming's been restricted to
desk duties, sir.
Christ, sir, do something!

35:47.479 --> 35:49.918
I don't have time for this
right now, Kate.

35:49.919 --> 35:54.399
There's been activity on Jackie
Laverty's phone. Get a triangulation
and phone it through.

36:02.079 --> 36:05.639
What's going on with Kate?
Ain't got a scooby.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.078
Something's been bugging me, boss.

36:09.079 --> 36:13.358
Arnott was totally convinced
you were with Jackie
the night she disappeared.

36:13.359 --> 36:18.759
Only people who knew you weren't
answering your job phone was me,
Dot and Kate.

36:26.839 --> 36:29.078
'Target vehicle
not sighted.'

36:29.079 --> 36:30.878
DCI Gates' phone. Nige, it's Kate.

36:30.879 --> 36:34.038
'Triangulation take times
but I can give you
the nearest base station.'

36:34.039 --> 36:36.238
DC Fleming, standing by.

36:36.239 --> 36:38.678
Stand by for base station.

36:38.679 --> 36:40.398
What the hell's going on, Leah?

36:40.399 --> 36:44.718
There's been a complaint made
about you from some old boy called
Alf Butterfield. Oh, Christ!

36:44.719 --> 36:49.958
'DC Fleming, come in.'
Fleming. 'T-Mobile base station
93016, macrocell.'

36:49.959 --> 36:52.718
93016.

36:52.719 --> 36:57.998
'Corner of Goswell Road and Spedmore
Avenue.' Corner of Goswell Road
and Spedmore Avenue. Corner of...

36:57.999 --> 37:02.118
I heard. 'Target vehicle sighted.
A black four-wheel drive.'

37:02.119 --> 37:07.079
DCI Gates to backup. Continue as
directed. I'm going on another call.

37:09.679 --> 37:13.999
Boss, what are you doing?
Jackie's alive, Nige.

37:17.039 --> 37:22.118
'Alexander Avenue. 100 metres
southwest of intersection
with Prince Charles Avenue.'

37:22.119 --> 37:26.238
Alexander Avenue. 100 metres.
Repeat, 1-0-0 metres.

37:26.239 --> 37:30.959
'Southwest of intersection
with Prince Charles Avenue.'
Got it. Thanks, Kate.

37:39.199 --> 37:41.759
Next... should be Alexander Avenue.

37:43.079 --> 37:45.119
Here it is - Alexander.
Left, left, left, left!

37:58.399 --> 38:03.919
'In pursuit, black four-wheel drive,
travelling southbound
on Prince Charles Avenue.'

38:08.159 --> 38:10.399
'Target's turning, he's turning!

38:14.759 --> 38:18.919
'We've lost him.
Not visual, repeat not visual.'

38:38.359 --> 38:41.159
Nige, get in,
we're going after them!

38:44.679 --> 38:47.959
Health and safety. This is not
a designated pursuit vehicle.

38:48.999 --> 38:51.599
Whatever!

39:14.079 --> 39:17.199
Where? Haven't a clue.

39:26.879 --> 39:31.878
Get out on the road after them, I'm
going to guide in the backup. Tone?!

39:31.879 --> 39:37.078
DCI Gates to backup. I'm visual
with the target vehicle heading
north on Prince Charles Avenue.

39:37.079 --> 39:38.759
Tone. Tone!

39:39.919 --> 39:42.279
Still visual.
North on Prince Charles...

39:44.159 --> 39:45.519
Bloody hell, Tone!

39:50.039 --> 39:55.999
Still visual. North on
Prince Charles, still visual.
'Received.'

40:07.559 --> 40:09.559
'DCI Gates?'

40:16.279 --> 40:19.039
Where's Jackie?
Is she still alive?

40:46.719 --> 40:48.279
No!

40:59.639 --> 41:01.278
You dirty bastard.

41:01.279 --> 41:04.799
You little shit!

41:11.639 --> 41:13.318
Yeah, Tommy?

41:13.319 --> 41:15.558
He's here.

41:15.559 --> 41:18.558
'Jackie was working for me.
Now you are,

41:18.559 --> 41:22.318
'unless you want her body being found
with your dirty business all over her

41:22.319 --> 41:25.038
'and your prints on the knife.

41:25.039 --> 41:28.799
'Keep the phone. Don't call us.
We'll call you.'

41:34.519 --> 41:36.238
You pig. Bastard!

41:36.239 --> 41:38.758
You pig bastard!

41:38.759 --> 41:41.878
Pig bastard! Pig bastard!

41:41.879 --> 41:46.878
Any luck with the DNA on the whisky
glass? Well, we sampled
one set of DNA from the rim...

41:46.879 --> 41:50.638
Don't tell me -
it matches Jackie's.

41:50.639 --> 41:53.439
Well...?
You said not to tell you.

41:56.799 --> 41:58.279
Come here.

42:00.039 --> 42:01.359
Thank you.

42:07.559 --> 42:09.078
What's going on?

42:09.079 --> 42:12.678
I'm chasing forensics that place
Gates at Jackie's murder.

42:12.679 --> 42:16.398
You got any? No. No.

42:16.399 --> 42:20.718
But you've just made a spectacle
of yourself by searching Gates's car
in front of the whole station.

42:20.719 --> 42:23.438
Then you go and visit
the man's wife, at his house.

42:23.439 --> 42:27.038
I'm trying to put pressure on him.
Play him at his own game.

42:27.039 --> 42:32.318
How can we expect our officers
to behave professionally, if we can't
behave professionally ourselves?!

42:32.319 --> 42:35.438
You're over the line here,
son, your way over the line.

42:35.439 --> 42:38.758
I tell you what...

42:38.759 --> 42:43.679
You better come back with a result
out of this... for all our sakes.

43:10.359 --> 43:16.919
Now they know we've ID'd the
vehicle, we can expect it to turn up
in a scrap yard any time soon.

43:20.879 --> 43:25.119
I've go to go and tell Hilton.
You lot get home,
go and have something to eat.

43:28.079 --> 43:31.719
Fancy a pint, boss?
Not tonight, matey.

43:44.319 --> 43:46.398
What was that about desk duties
today?

43:46.399 --> 43:50.198
It's just some bollocks, sir.
It's been sorted.

43:50.199 --> 43:53.239
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:54.879 --> 43:56.719
Are you sure you're all right, sir?

43:56.720 --> 44:01.038
Yeah, doctor says I'm fine.

44:01.039 --> 44:04.598
It's just you was out of contact
for over an hour.

44:04.599 --> 44:06.518
What happened?

44:06.519 --> 44:11.318
I was, erm, chasing around
like an idiot
and I made a tit out of myself.

44:11.319 --> 44:15.038
And I'd quite like to drop it.

44:15.039 --> 44:17.599
Well, maybe you need that pint
after all.

44:19.559 --> 44:21.599
I just want to help, sir.

44:23.679 --> 44:26.519
I'll be honest with you, Kate,
I'm not sure that anybody can.

44:39.719 --> 44:41.679
How are things at home, sir?

44:44.839 --> 44:50.398
Look, I'm no angel. I've got
involved with the wrong bloke,
on the job and outside.

44:50.399 --> 44:53.838
Everyone has to let off a little
bit of steam now and then.

44:53.839 --> 44:56.798
AC don't get it.
They're robots, them lot.

44:56.799 --> 45:01.439
They don't get the difference
between a corrupt copper
and a decent one who made a mistake.

45:02.639 --> 45:03.999
I do.

45:09.159 --> 45:13.198
Everyone knows there's a piece
of evidence that AC's after.
That doesn't exist!

45:13.199 --> 45:19.598
What if it did? Give me the chance
to prove myself to you. This is a
conversation we shouldn't be having!

45:19.599 --> 45:24.838
Well, if Arnott finds it,
that's your career over, sir.

45:24.839 --> 45:27.398
A genuinely talented officer.
All for one silly mistake.

45:27.399 --> 45:31.998
I'm not bent! OK, I'm not!
You know that, right?

45:31.999 --> 45:33.799
Yeah.

45:38.639 --> 45:40.039
Where is it, sir?

46:07.119 --> 46:09.119
It's in a skip.

47:11.119 --> 47:15.679
Who the bloody hell
do you think you are? Easy, Tone,
that's not going to help, mate.

47:18.039 --> 47:21.358
See down the drain, Gates?
Kind of appropriate.

47:21.359 --> 47:25.438
You're really loving this,
you bastard! All right,
calm yourselves. What's happening?

47:25.439 --> 47:29.399
AC got a tip-off about
the whisky glass.

47:41.799 --> 47:44.399
Anything? No.

47:45.639 --> 47:48.998
Sorry, what was that about
something going down the drain?

47:48.999 --> 47:51.398
Would that be your investigation?

47:51.399 --> 47:53.478
All right.

47:53.479 --> 47:55.518
You're a tit.

47:55.519 --> 47:57.319
And you, Buckells.

48:02.199 --> 48:04.238
I don't get it, sir.

48:04.239 --> 48:07.078
I made up a story about a phantom
piece of evidence,

48:07.079 --> 48:12.159
and I told you that it was in a
skip, Nige I told it was in a ditch
and Dot that it was in a pond.

48:13.919 --> 48:17.838
Deepak, he's the one I told
it was in that drain.
I've been up all night,

48:17.839 --> 48:22.519
weighing up my career against
helping you out. No, Kate, that's
not what I... You bastard, sir.

48:23.639 --> 48:26.239
Kate! Kate!

48:30.079 --> 48:33.678
I was acting on apparently
reliable information.

48:33.679 --> 48:38.398
We've had a contact request
from Colin Brackley.
He was the senior fire officer...

48:38.399 --> 48:42.959
Screw him. I wouldn't burn my
bridges if I was you, son. Not now.

49:06.199 --> 49:09.238
Let me buy you a drink...
I'm not staying.

49:09.239 --> 49:11.199
Just say what you came here to say.

49:16.279 --> 49:21.038
The lads are all getting twitchy.
We've all been
suspended from active duty,

49:21.039 --> 49:25.758
and we've heard you're going
to accuse us of lying to cover up
breaking into the wrong flat.

49:25.759 --> 49:29.759
And you're saying I screwed up the
orders, sent you in the wrong door?

49:30.799 --> 49:33.358
This has got out of hand.
That's why I'm here.

49:33.359 --> 49:37.678
It took guts for you lot to go in
there, thinking he was a bomber.

49:37.679 --> 49:42.518
All I know is, we've all been
asked to lie and I'm the only one
not going along with it.

49:42.519 --> 49:46.718
We both know there was a massive
failure of intel. The op was thrown
together without proper prep.

49:46.719 --> 49:50.238
No-one responsible wants
to cop for that.
That's why they're laying it on us.

49:50.239 --> 49:52.518
There's no "us".

49:52.519 --> 49:55.198
There is
if we all tell the same story.

49:55.199 --> 49:58.838
And in return, none of the lads
put any blame in my direction?

49:58.839 --> 50:01.359
We're in this together, Steve.

50:04.159 --> 50:07.119
An innocent man is dead.

50:09.919 --> 50:13.399
There's not a day goes by
I don't think about that.

50:15.719 --> 50:19.478
I was the one who pulled
the trigger.

50:19.479 --> 50:21.519
I'm sick with it, man.

50:22.999 --> 50:25.038
I can't sleep at night.

50:25.039 --> 50:27.518
I can't look any other copper
in the eye.

50:27.519 --> 50:33.719
I'm bouncing my little boy on
my knee and I just burst out crying
for no reason.

50:37.039 --> 50:40.758
You feel it too, don't you?
The guilt.

50:40.759 --> 50:43.959
You knew the kill order
was suspect.
If you hadn't passed it on...

50:49.359 --> 50:51.759
Let me get you another drink.

50:53.919 --> 50:59.518
Nothing's going to bring him back.
So what good does it do for us to be
thrown on the scrap heap?

50:59.519 --> 51:03.398
Isn't it better, isn't it a
better service for us to put this
behind us

51:03.399 --> 51:06.959
and be the cleanest, most dedicated
officers on the job?

51:09.239 --> 51:12.038
You've already figured that out,
haven't you?

51:12.039 --> 51:14.519
That's why you joined
Anti-corruption.

51:29.599 --> 51:31.679
A pint, please.

51:56.439 --> 51:58.999
You're finished!

52:02.239 --> 52:05.039
You're over the line here, son,
you're way over the line.

52:08.479 --> 52:12.719
You take a shot at the king,
make sure you kill him, son.

52:41.279 --> 52:45.799
So you're going to take all of us
down with you, are you, sir?

52:47.999 --> 52:50.039
You arrogant wanker.

53:10.039 --> 53:12.238
What do you want?

53:12.239 --> 53:16.039
I'd like to speak to DC Fleming,
if I may, sir?

53:17.799 --> 53:19.718
How can I help, sir?

53:19.719 --> 53:22.838
Yeah, you were involved in the trace
on Jackie Laverty's phone?

53:22.839 --> 53:26.598
Erm, it's our best lead on
her possible whereabouts. OK.

53:26.599 --> 53:28.278
It would be great to get your...

53:28.279 --> 53:30.398
You want to speak to a member
of my team,

53:30.399 --> 53:33.919
put in a request, in writing, to me!

53:47.679 --> 53:51.199
Er, excuse me, sir.
I've been meaning to talk to you.

53:52.399 --> 53:57.998
Erm, all this Anti-corruption.
It's, er, bad for me nerves.

53:57.999 --> 54:01.678
I'm sorry to hear that, Rita.
I'll have to go on the sick.

54:01.679 --> 54:03.239
You'll be missed.

54:14.119 --> 54:17.879
I don't know, in the last three
months my migraines have got worse.

54:20.599 --> 54:23.279
I'm sure my union
will have something to say about it.

54:28.199 --> 54:30.238
I'm sorry,
Ted, I know you've been chasing me.

54:30.239 --> 54:34.158
It occurred to me that neutral
ground often makes for
more productive conversations.

54:34.159 --> 54:37.078
It's always nice
to get out of the office, sir.

54:37.079 --> 54:40.118
Frankly, I've been avoiding this
conversation.

54:40.119 --> 54:45.198
I was beginning to feel a wee bit
like the ginger stepchild, there.

54:45.199 --> 54:47.478
I spent two years in AC myself.

54:47.479 --> 54:49.518
I see this situation
from both sides.

54:49.519 --> 54:52.998
If Gates
had solved the triple murder,

54:52.999 --> 54:55.359
he could've shaken off
these allegations.

54:57.679 --> 55:00.358
Now, he's a dead man walking.
So why keep digging?

55:00.359 --> 55:04.398
Well, for proof, sir. Proof that
Tony Gates was at a murder scene.

55:04.399 --> 55:08.639
There are only so many drains
you can look down before
AC-12 becomes a laughing stock.

55:09.679 --> 55:11.918
We've followed procedure to
the letter, sir.

55:11.919 --> 55:18.838
I don't doubt it for a minute, but
Tony Gates is, uh, from the South.

55:18.839 --> 55:22.198
I'm sure you'd be mortified,
Ted, mortified,

55:22.199 --> 55:24.638
if anyone formed the opinion
that AC-12 makes

55:24.639 --> 55:28.159
a point of pressing charges
against officers from the South.

55:29.639 --> 55:32.759
Everyone receives the exact
same treatment.

55:34.199 --> 55:36.838
Of course, of course,
it's a delicate balance.

55:36.839 --> 55:42.758
But no one would
welcome the accusation that the case
against an officer from the South

55:42.759 --> 55:44.639
was being pursued with unusual
alacrity.

56:03.319 --> 56:04.119
Yeah, I'm here.

56:04.120 --> 56:07.558
'Your bird's money laundering
is going to lead your lot to me.

56:07.559 --> 56:10.038
'You better get it sorted out.'

56:10.039 --> 56:11.319
Look, erm...

56:12.679 --> 56:15.358
I can't make a move
without being watched.

56:15.359 --> 56:18.479
'That's your problem,
you bent bastard.'

56:23.279 --> 56:24.318
Dad!

56:24.319 --> 56:25.838
Hey, darling.

56:25.839 --> 56:28.318
We love it when you pick us up.
Do you?

56:28.319 --> 56:29.399
What are you doing here?

56:29.400 --> 56:33.558
Well, I thought I'd surprise you,
munchkin, is that all right? Yeah.

56:33.559 --> 56:34.879
Give me a hug.

56:45.359 --> 56:48.918
On a separate note sir, we've had
a complaint against DC Fleming...

56:48.919 --> 56:54.079
er, from Alfred Butterfield -
failure to assiduously
investigate burglary and assault.

56:55.279 --> 56:57.878
That's small fry, station level.

56:57.879 --> 57:00.078
Yeah, it's all to do with her
time at the CID.

57:00.079 --> 57:02.438
I've had a look at the facts again,

57:02.439 --> 57:06.198
I think DC Fleming really should
return to normal duties at TO-20.

57:06.199 --> 57:09.498
Yeah, it's your call. Excuse me.

57:09.545 --> 57:11.865
Yeah.

57:50.274 --> 58:02.411
