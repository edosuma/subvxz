WEBVTT

00:07.341 --> 00:10.411
**

00:22.923 --> 00:26.927
(man)
Are we ready for studio visits,
my little chickens?

00:26.927 --> 00:28.562
Cluck, cluck!

00:28.562 --> 00:30.798
Ah, Persephone.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.366
I see you've been
experimenting

00:32.366 --> 00:34.268
with more freehand figurative
surrealism.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.904
Yeah.
It was a spot-on suggestion.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.073
Better than that silly
cartooning

00:39.073 --> 00:40.141
you were doodling with.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.143
Glad you decided to leave
high school behind

00:42.143 --> 00:44.378
and join us here at art school.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.115
In fact, tonight
I'm guest curating

00:47.115 --> 00:49.617
at Le Gallerie de Pretensión,

00:49.617 --> 00:52.620
and a piece like this might
fit in perfectly.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.722
Really?
You think I'm at that level?

00:54.722 --> 00:56.790
Just might be.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.926
Show me what you have by
the end of the day.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.295
Oh, sir, thank you!
I will not let you down.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.464
I know I can make work
that is original

01:03.464 --> 01:05.499
and true and objectively great.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.435
I know I can make fine art.

01:07.435 --> 01:10.571
Actually, a lot of fine art is
none of those things.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.905
(wolf whistle)

01:11.905 --> 01:13.674
Uh, I don't think
the models

01:13.674 --> 01:14.808
are supposed to talk
to the students.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.577
Oh, I'm not a model.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.813
I'm Adam Conover, and this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

01:19.813 --> 01:20.814
**

01:20.814 --> 01:22.082
Oh!
Ugh.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.959
Hold on, Dilbert.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.861
Who are you to tell me
about art?

01:33.861 --> 01:35.829
Okay, I know
what great art is.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.097
I have taste.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.167
I've studied the masters.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.101
I read Art Quorum magazine.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.171
I have a tattoo of
the Mona Lisa.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.539
Bask in her mysterious smile,

01:45.539 --> 01:49.009
her enigmatic gaze,
her creepy lack of eyebrows.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.611
That's why it's the greatest
painting in the world.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.147
Actually, the reason we think
the Mona Lisa

01:53.147 --> 01:57.050
is the greatest painting in the
world is not because it's great.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.453
Here, I'll show you.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.793
We're so perfectly
proportioned.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.128
Are we Da Vinci sketches?
Yep.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.898
I thought it would better
illustrate my point!

02:10.898 --> 02:13.301
Leonardo Da Vinci
wasn't always considered

02:13.301 --> 02:14.568
one of the greatest painters,

02:14.568 --> 02:16.204
and the Mona Lisa

02:16.204 --> 02:18.306
wasn't even considered
his greatest painting.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.907
Good, not great.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.375
It's no Titian.

02:21.375 --> 02:24.144
But that started to change
in 1911,

02:24.144 --> 02:27.147
when one night, a handyman at
the Louvre hid in a closet,

02:27.147 --> 02:28.849
took the Mona Lisa
off the wall

02:28.849 --> 02:30.984
and walked right out
the door with it.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.586
It couldn't have been that easy.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.188
How did he get past
all the security?

02:34.188 --> 02:35.656
Huh, there wasn't much.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.057
Back then,
the Mona Lisa

02:37.057 --> 02:38.826
was just another painting
in the Louvre.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.928
So it took over a day
until the guards

02:40.928 --> 02:42.496
even realized it was missing.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.199
Oh, something's different
in here.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.568
Oh, yeah.
There's a nail in the wall.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.270
Now that's art.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.605
But when newspapers started
reporting on the daring heist,

02:51.605 --> 02:55.243
the Mona Lisa
became a media sensation.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.847
So after it was recovered
two years later,

02:59.847 --> 03:03.083
the Mona Lisa was now the most
popular painting in the museum,

03:03.083 --> 03:04.552
and soon,
people were calling it

03:04.552 --> 03:06.086
one of the greatest
in the world.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.256
Oh, what a mysterious smile.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.458
And a gaze that follows you
around the room.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.059
Titian who, I say.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.527
Okay, wait.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.430
That philistine couldn't care
less before and now he loves it?

03:16.430 --> 03:17.598
What happened?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.933
Well, one reason is a
psychological phenomenon

03:19.933 --> 03:23.036
called the mere-exposure
effect.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.038
This is James E. Cutting,

03:25.038 --> 03:26.774
professor in the Department
of Psychology

03:26.774 --> 03:28.108
at Cornell University.

03:28.108 --> 03:30.043
Professor, would you mind
teaching Persephone

03:30.043 --> 03:31.412
about the mere-exposure
effect?

03:31.412 --> 03:34.448
The mere-exposure effect is a
psychological phenomenon.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.317
Basically, the more often you
see something,

03:36.317 --> 03:37.818
the more you tend to like it.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.553
I conducted an experiment

03:39.553 --> 03:42.823
and I showed viewers pairs of
paintings by the same artist

03:42.823 --> 03:44.725
and I asked them which one they
preferred,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.159
and without recognizing them,

03:46.159 --> 03:48.228
they tended to prefer the
better-known painting,

03:48.228 --> 03:49.630
even though they
didn't realize

03:49.630 --> 03:51.499
they had ever seen that
painting before.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.234
In a second experiment, I showed
a different group of subjects

03:54.234 --> 03:57.738
the lesser-known paintings four
times as often as the others,

03:57.738 --> 04:00.073
and even though they saw the
same pairs of paintings,

04:00.073 --> 04:01.241
now they had no preference

04:01.241 --> 04:03.344
of one group of paintings over
the other.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.746
And this result suggests that
the first group of viewers

04:05.746 --> 04:08.449
chose the well-known paintings
not because they were better

04:08.449 --> 04:10.518
but only because they were more
familiar.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.753
So you're saying that's what
happened with the Mona Lisa.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.188
People liked it more because it
became more familiar to them.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.790
Yep. And the more they saw it,

04:16.790 --> 04:18.626
the more they shared
and copied it.

04:18.626 --> 04:21.429
So today, the Mona Lisa
is more familiar than ever

04:21.429 --> 04:23.597
and the effect is
even more powerful.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.998
Thanks, Professor.

04:24.998 --> 04:28.302
Adam, does this mean I'm stuck
in the slide forever?

04:28.302 --> 04:31.439
Now, look, the Mona Lisa is
a great work of art,

04:31.439 --> 04:34.642
but the only reason
we think it's the greatest
painting of all time

04:34.642 --> 04:37.378
is because it's the most famous
painting of all time.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.946
Okay, and it's only famous

04:38.946 --> 04:40.881
because of some historical
accident. Who cares?

04:40.881 --> 04:43.183
Well, it's not always an
accident.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.118
Just ask the CIA.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.221
In the '50s, the Cold War was
also a culture war

04:48.221 --> 04:49.623
and Russia was out to prove

04:49.623 --> 04:52.726
that America was
an artistic wasteland.

04:52.726 --> 04:56.129
(chuckles, Russian accent)
You Americans not capable
of great art.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.131
You not even have realist
painting

04:58.131 --> 05:00.901
of hearty woman using
wheat-threshing machine.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.004
The CIA saw American abstract
art as an opportunity

05:04.004 --> 05:07.240
to make Soviet painting look
rigid an unimaginative.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.542
We gotta fight this, boys.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.678
Show me our best American art.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.145
(Adam)
There was just one problem.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.015
Back then, most people hated
abstract art.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.884
Oh.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.520
Well, you gotta dance with the
one that brung ya.

05:24.091 --> 05:27.361
In the '50s and '60s,
the CIA secretly sponsored

05:27.361 --> 05:30.731
art tours and
exhibitions around the world,

05:30.731 --> 05:33.734
and they made abstract art so
ubiquitous, it even started

05:33.734 --> 05:36.770
showing up as décor in
offices and airports.

05:36.770 --> 05:40.741
I spent years looking for
meaning out my office window.

05:40.741 --> 05:44.011
Then I saw this painting hanging
in the Newark Airport,

05:44.011 --> 05:48.916
and I realized, maybe I'm not
such a madman after all.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.420
That's how they talk on
"Mad Men," right?

05:52.420 --> 05:53.921
I mean, sorta.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.524
Now, abstract expressionism
was always good art,

05:56.524 --> 06:00.227
but this push from the CIA
helped make it popular art.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.196
No!

06:03.196 --> 06:06.133
No, the man does not get to
decide what becomes popular.

06:06.133 --> 06:09.202
Things become popular because
they are objectively brilliant.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.204
Actually, it's the other way
around.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.206
A lot of art is only
considered brilliant

06:13.206 --> 06:16.043
because it was already popular.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.911
Attaboy, Clarence.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.247
"It's a Wonderful Life" wasn't
considered a classic

06:20.247 --> 06:21.915
until the 1970s,

06:21.915 --> 06:24.585
when TV channels started
rerunning it like crazy,

06:24.585 --> 06:26.253
and the same thing happens
in music.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.756
Ugh, is that why they play
the same Chainsmokers song

06:28.756 --> 06:30.390
over and over again
on the radio?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.559
Maybe.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.093
Research shows that hearing
a song more often

06:33.093 --> 06:34.928
can actually make you
like it more.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.130
But heck, even my show
is an example.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.399
I mean, by all rights, I can be
pretty abrasive, but the network

06:39.399 --> 06:41.735
kept airing it and now people
say they got used to me.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.903
How nice for them.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.237
The point is,

06:44.237 --> 06:46.139
you might not like what you like
because it's better.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.642
It might just have been in front
of your face the most.

06:48.642 --> 06:52.746
But if that's true,
then I don't have taste at all.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.983
Then how would I know if
anything is good?

06:55.983 --> 06:57.818
No.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.520
No, this is ridiculous.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.321
I have a refined palette,

07:01.321 --> 07:03.791
and just like all the other
great artists before me,

07:03.791 --> 07:06.594
I am going to tap into
the depths of my soul

07:06.594 --> 07:09.597
and create the most amazing,
original piece of art

07:09.597 --> 07:12.600
Le Gallerie de Pretensión
has ever seen.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.268
Oh, originality in art
is way overrated.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.438
In fact, many of history's
greatest artists were
flagrant copiers.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.274
Ugh!
Go forge yourself!

07:21.274 --> 07:23.176
Wait, I have more facts!

07:23.176 --> 07:24.778
Excuse me.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.282
**

07:30.317 --> 07:31.619
Hello, everyone.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.153
I am here in the "Adam Ruins
Everything" office,

07:33.153 --> 07:36.123
talking at further length with
Professor James Cutting.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.324
Thank you for being--

07:37.324 --> 07:38.559
You got out of the slide
projector, that's good.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.360
I did, thank you very much.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.195
Is there any upside to
the near-exposure effect?

07:42.195 --> 07:43.697
All of culture is based on it.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.198
How so?
That's fascinating.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.702
I think culture is nothing but a
thin veneer of familiarity.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.303
The example I like best

07:50.303 --> 07:54.241
is that my family and I
were in Paris in 1993.
Yeah.

07:54.241 --> 07:57.477
And the French toilet paper at
that time was...

07:57.477 --> 07:59.046
I can't wait to see how
you tie this back to art.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.314
... awful.
It was awful.
Okay.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.183
But I promise you,
by the end of the year,

08:03.183 --> 08:04.484
it seemed perfectly normal.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.986
I came back to the States,

08:05.986 --> 08:08.155
and I said, what's this stuff
that falls apart?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.356
Yeah.
I mean, you know...

08:09.356 --> 08:11.859
It's just,
we get used to stuff.
Yeah.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.094
You know, you--
you go to the same bars,

08:14.094 --> 08:15.395
you drink the same beers.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.064
You're saying if those
collectors had put

08:17.064 --> 08:19.900
the French toilet paper up in
the gallery, people would be--

08:19.900 --> 08:22.570
People would be like,
I love this toilet paper,
I can't get enough.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.337
And we would all be
converted by now.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.173
You can say that on your show,
but I won't.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.341
The near exposure effect applies
both to art and to toilet paper,

08:28.341 --> 08:30.878
you heard it here first.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.613
It's the rear exposure effect,

08:32.613 --> 08:35.849
thank you, my producer John,
with a great pun.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.119
So, can you sort of
summarize your work on
art preference for us,

08:39.119 --> 08:40.954
like, in a broader way
than you did on the show?

08:40.954 --> 08:42.522
The overall
principle here is

08:42.522 --> 08:44.357
that there are a lot
of good paintings,

08:44.357 --> 08:47.394
but in reflecting on all of this
research that I've done,

08:47.394 --> 08:50.297
one of the things that I'm a
little better at doing now

08:50.297 --> 08:54.201
is that I can ask myself, well,
why do I like this thing?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.536
Is it because it's famous?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.871
Is it because
something else?

08:57.871 --> 09:01.274
And usually, no, I'm kind of
bored with the famous stuff.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.910
Mona Lisa's fine.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.613
You know, Ginerva De'Benci is,
I think, just as good.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.080
I don't even know that one.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.415
The Lady with the Ermine.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.317
The Lady with an Ermine?
Lady with the Ermine, yeah.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.885
I really like that
you're just--

09:11.885 --> 09:13.587
Mona Lisa, ahh, the Lady with
the Ermine's just as good.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.722
It is.
People don't know it.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.624
Ginerva De'Benci, I think,
is even better.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.391
I've not heard of
any of these.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.060
Yeah, well, okay.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.795
Well, stick with us,
there's gonna be more

09:21.795 --> 09:24.131
"Adam Ruins Everything"
coming up right after this.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.102
Two hours until the opening.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.672
I just need one great idea.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.573
Something totally original.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.008
Like turtles
playing poker?

09:35.008 --> 09:36.409
Agh!

09:36.409 --> 09:37.611
Go away!

09:37.611 --> 09:39.412
This studio is a sanctuary.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.915
Don't soil it with your...
plagiarism.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.484
Sorry. Even the greatest
artists in history

09:44.484 --> 09:45.753
weren't totally original.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.621
They all copied each other.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.289
You cannot seriously
be suggesting

09:49.289 --> 09:52.325
that somebody like Michelangelo
was a copier.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.795
Oh, that's exactly
what I'm suggesting.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.764
We all imagine
that Michelangelo

09:56.764 --> 09:59.800
spent his life communing
with the muses.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.270
Whisper to me your desire,
sweet marble.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.205
What should I make of thee?

10:05.205 --> 10:07.274
A beautiful Madonna

10:07.274 --> 10:11.144
or a towering David with the
tiniest of wee-wees?

10:11.144 --> 10:13.280
But this master
of originality

10:13.280 --> 10:15.949
actually started his career
as a forger.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.951
Or we could just knock off
some Roman thing.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.053
I mean, people love that crap,
right?

10:20.053 --> 10:24.024
In the late 1400s, ancient Roman
sculpture was all the rage,

10:24.024 --> 10:26.526
and just like today, it was a
lot easier to sell a classic

10:26.526 --> 10:28.796
than something by an
up-and-coming artist.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.630
So according to his first
biographer,

10:30.630 --> 10:32.632
Michelangelo cooked up a scam.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.403
I-- I found this
in the ground, eh?

10:36.403 --> 10:38.005
Looks legit to me.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.073
He scammed the church?

10:40.073 --> 10:42.375
If I believed in organized
religion, I would be appalled.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.212
Well, some historians blame
his dealer, but either way,

10:45.212 --> 10:48.481
Michelangelo was flagrantly
copying older sculptures.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.917
And it paid off.

10:49.917 --> 10:53.420
Back then, copying the masters
was considered a valuable skill.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.255
It was actually the best thing
an artist could do

10:55.255 --> 10:56.824
to prove his talent.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.091
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.860
Is this a forgery?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.494
Literally classic!

11:01.494 --> 11:02.595
Come to Rome!

11:02.595 --> 11:04.164
We'll get you a job.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.066
What a horrid time period.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.268
I'm sure later, people prized
originality in art.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.772
Yeah, but they also prized
the fine art of imitation.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.674
For instance, Vincent Van Gogh,
who drew inspiration from--

11:14.674 --> 11:17.344
From his mad, tortured genius,
obviously.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.180
Cut off his own ear,
like a real artist.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.915
Okay, first of all, why do
people think having

11:21.915 --> 11:24.752
serious mental health issues
makes you a better artist?

11:24.752 --> 11:26.854
What?
I can't hear you.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.555
I cut off my ear in
a psychotic incident

11:28.555 --> 11:30.924
completely unrelated to my
artistic ability.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.761
And second, Van Gogh
copied for his art.

11:33.761 --> 11:38.698
From 1889 to '90, Van Gogh honed
his style by making 21 copies

11:38.698 --> 11:42.202
of paintings by his favorite
artist, Jean-François Millet.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.971
Yeah, I'm cuckoo.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.538
Cuckoo for copying paintings.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.941
It was basically fine art
fan art,

11:47.941 --> 11:50.443
except his fan art hangs
in the Met.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.880
(Adam) In fact,
all the masters did it.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.116
Just like when Claude Monet
painted his dayjon--

11:56.116 --> 11:57.985
Dayjonnay...

11:57.985 --> 11:59.286
"Lunch on the Grass."

11:59.286 --> 12:01.721
He was inspired by Edouard
Manet's masterpiece,

12:01.721 --> 12:04.057
also entitled
"Lunch on the Grass."

12:04.057 --> 12:07.427
And Manet was inspired by the
women in this Titian painting.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.129
And the poses of the figures

12:09.129 --> 12:12.232
from this Marcantonio Raimondi
engraving.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.466
See?

12:13.466 --> 12:15.836
These great artists all borrowed
elements from each other

12:15.836 --> 12:18.338
but then transformed them
into new art.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.241
That's not plagiarism.
It's more like one big...

12:21.241 --> 12:23.076
(man)
R-r-r-remix!

12:23.076 --> 12:24.744
**

12:24.744 --> 12:26.947
And that's something all great
artists do.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.082
Shakespeare wrote
"Romeo and Juliet"

12:29.082 --> 12:32.953
after he read an epic poem
called "Romeus and Juliet."

12:32.953 --> 12:34.521
Huh.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.689
Watch out, Stratford-upon-Avon!

12:36.689 --> 12:39.927
Your boy the Bard is about
to do it again!

12:41.594 --> 12:44.664
Of course, hip-hop has elevated
sampling to an art form,

12:44.664 --> 12:47.835
which follows in the tradition
of Mozart, who borrowed music

12:47.835 --> 12:51.038
from a Viennese opera to write
"The Magic Flute."

12:51.038 --> 12:52.940
**

12:54.674 --> 12:56.709
Even classic films do it.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.312
George Lucas created "Star Wars"
by borrowing elements

12:59.312 --> 13:02.049
from everything, from mythology
to Samurai movies

13:02.049 --> 13:05.185
to Flash Gordon serials
from the 1930s.

13:06.854 --> 13:10.023
Those films were shot first.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.791
See?
Throughout history,

13:11.791 --> 13:14.294
remixing and adapting
the works of the past

13:14.294 --> 13:17.464
has been an essential creative
tool for pushing art forward.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.233
But that's the opposite
of everything I've been
taught here.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.634
Are you sure about that?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.503
Kinda seems like your
instructor's just been

13:23.503 --> 13:27.474
pushing you to do what he wants
and that's not very original.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.210
What is this?

13:30.210 --> 13:31.744
I know, Professor.
I didn't even mean to--

13:31.744 --> 13:32.812
(claps hands)

13:32.812 --> 13:35.415
(clapping)

13:35.415 --> 13:38.919
This is worthy of Le Gallerie
de Pretensión.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.487
Really?
You think it's good enough?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.089
Oh, yes.

13:42.089 --> 13:44.157
Such raw emotion.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.825
You can really feel the
artist's...

13:45.825 --> 13:47.594
Seething rage?
Yes.

13:47.594 --> 13:51.698
This must be in
tonight's show!

13:51.698 --> 13:54.234
My painting is going to be up
in the same gallery

13:54.234 --> 13:55.702
as the great
Flamian Flurst.

13:55.702 --> 13:56.703
I can't believe that.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.006
Uh, don't get too excited.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.207
Because the fine art market

14:00.207 --> 14:02.042
is just one big
price-fixing scheme.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.011
No. You do not get to
ruin this for me.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.078
I'm going to that opening
tonight.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.679
Well, hope you got
a plus-one.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.351
That's it, Vinny.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.553
Time to lay off the absinthe.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.591
That's it, Vinny.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.700
Ooh!

14:27.700 --> 14:31.771
My painting is in the same
gallery as a Jeff Spoons!

14:31.771 --> 14:33.773
And an Angsty!

14:33.773 --> 14:36.276
There's Marinara Abramowitz!

14:36.276 --> 14:39.546
Oh, my grackle,
that is Flamian Flurst.

14:39.546 --> 14:44.151
A crab surrounded by Vaseline.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.153
It's exquisite, isn't it?

14:46.153 --> 14:49.756
Mr. Flurst,
you have outdone yourself.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.424
Sycophants surround me.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.093
I need a fresh eye.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.627
You.
Nothing girl.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.629
Me?
What do you think?

14:56.629 --> 15:02.069
Uh, well, it certainly
is a crab.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.471
In Vaseline?

15:04.471 --> 15:09.309
I love the candor of normals.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.278
No, I'm not a normal!

15:11.278 --> 15:12.980
I'm an artist!

15:12.980 --> 15:15.482
You have insulted Mr. Flurst.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.250
This is a masterpiece.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.020
It just sold for 5 billion.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.255
Of course it did.
It's brilliant.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.160
Oh, it's performance art!

15:27.160 --> 15:30.030
These rich snobs don't know
more about art than you.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.531
They're mostly just here
to make money.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.133
Oh!

15:33.133 --> 15:35.202
We're told that art like this
is so expensive

15:35.202 --> 15:37.037
because it's the best
in the world.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.340
But the fact is, you're looking
at a massive price-fixing scheme

15:40.340 --> 15:44.277
that benefits wealthy collectors
and excludes artists like you.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.778
Adam, shush it!

15:45.778 --> 15:48.881
The prices here are high
because the art
is objectively good.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.650
Nope. The prices are
high because

15:50.650 --> 15:54.321
a small group of galleries and
collectors decided it was good,

15:54.321 --> 15:55.555
and once they do that,

15:55.555 --> 15:58.291
the price goes up, whether or
not anyone else agrees.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.328
You. Paint something.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.534
(gasps)

16:09.236 --> 16:12.139
I declare this valuable art.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.208
Go find more cubed meat.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.909
We're gonna be rich.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.178
(chuckles)

16:18.178 --> 16:20.813
Well, outsider art
is a rich tradition.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.149
How much is this worth?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.550
There's no way to tell.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.985
Big galleries actually keep
their prices a secret

16:25.985 --> 16:29.589
so they can change them
depending on who the buyer is.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.658
For you, my friend,
ten grand,

16:31.658 --> 16:34.361
and for you, my enemy,
200 grand.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.829
And they do their best
to keep out buyers

16:36.829 --> 16:38.931
who are considered elites.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.368
Daniel Radcliffe once tried to
buy a fancy painting,

16:41.368 --> 16:43.236
but he was denied when the
dealer told him

16:43.236 --> 16:46.005
he was waiting for a more
prestigious collector.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.175
For you?
Not for sale.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.509
Please, sir.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.711
I just want one painting that
doesn't talk to me.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.513
Why are you doing this to me?

16:53.513 --> 16:56.549
Because if the gallery only
sells to art world elites,

16:56.549 --> 16:58.385
they'll be seen as a better
brand,

16:58.385 --> 17:01.721
which means all of their other
paintings will be worth more.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.022
Ah.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.092
(cash registers dinging)

17:05.092 --> 17:07.194
Hmm. That is shady behavior.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.796
Well, luckily, we outsiders
could just go to art auctions.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.199
They're democratic open markets
where anyone can buy.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.933
Sorry, but the major
auction houses

17:13.933 --> 17:15.702
are just as rigged
as the galleries.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.070
(pounds gavel)

17:17.070 --> 17:20.407
Auctions play all sorts of dirty
tricks to drive their prices up,

17:20.407 --> 17:22.775
like straight up
paying people to bid.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.244
Let's start the bidding
at $4 million.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.945
Do I see 4 million?
(snoring)

17:28.881 --> 17:30.049
4 million.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.584
And if the bidding
is too slow,

17:31.584 --> 17:34.987
auctioneers even use a practice
called chandelier bidding.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.424
They just point to a random spot
above everyone's heads

17:37.424 --> 17:39.826
and pretend to see a bid.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.061
And I see 5 million from
the bidder in the back,

17:42.061 --> 17:44.431
she's my girlfriend
who you don't know
'cause she lives in Canada.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.499
Whoop, she's back across the
border, so don't turn around.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.968
Oh, whatever.
Six million.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.503
Why are you okay with this?

17:50.503 --> 17:51.738
Oh, simple, darling.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.840
I own other paintings
by this artist,

17:53.840 --> 17:55.908
so when this one sells high,

17:55.908 --> 17:59.579
it increases the value
of my entire collection.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.081
Sometimes we even bid
anonymously

18:02.081 --> 18:03.750
to drive up the price.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.085
Up next, we have a fine
comdiment-based work

18:06.085 --> 18:07.120
from an emerging artist.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.455
Ooh!

18:08.455 --> 18:10.623
I want to bid on this one.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.293
We should all bid on this one.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.628
Let's start the bidding
at $7 million.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.467
This shady market can also be
manipulated by crooks who use it

18:20.467 --> 18:23.336
to defraud the government
and launder dirty money.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.771
Hello.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.207
I would like to buy a painting
from your fine gallery

18:27.207 --> 18:29.209
using legitimate cash moneys.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.344
The red is... paint.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.782
But not all collectors
are crooks.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.284
I mean, there's good people
out there

18:37.284 --> 18:39.219
who donate their collections
to museums.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.054
Sure, and that seems
very charitable,

18:42.054 --> 18:44.957
until you remember that
that donation is also
a tax write-off.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.126
And here's where it can
get really shady.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.061
The collectors hire
their own appraisers

18:49.061 --> 18:51.631
to determine the value of
the art they donate,

18:51.631 --> 18:54.701
so they can use it as
one big tax dodge.

18:54.701 --> 18:59.172
You owe 40 million
in taxes this year.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.407
Ugh!

19:00.407 --> 19:05.077
What if I donate this painting
worth 40 million?

19:06.713 --> 19:10.049
At the end of the day, this is
what the fine art market is.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.985
A few rich people
passing money around.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.526
No! No! Then I want
no part of this!

19:19.526 --> 19:22.229
Screw this gallery
and screw this opening!

19:22.229 --> 19:24.497
I will make it in
the fine art world on my own.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.000
Sorry, that's not really
how it works.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.102
Persephone,
this is Allison Schrager.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.372
She's an economist and
journalist at Quartz

19:32.372 --> 19:34.006
who has reported on
the fine art market.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.509
Not only is the fine art world
manipulated financially,

19:36.509 --> 19:38.578
it's also extremely exclusive.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.747
Only a small share of artists
are allowed to succeed

19:40.747 --> 19:42.249
and only their work is
considered valuable.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.252
And those aren't necessarily
the best artists.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.220
Often, they're just the ones
who are best at

19:47.220 --> 19:49.922
marketing themselves and at
playing the gallery game.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.891
One art dealer I spoke
with even admitted

19:51.891 --> 19:53.360
that the art you buy
in the street

19:53.360 --> 19:55.695
is cheaper and often
just as good,

19:55.695 --> 19:57.297
it's just not as prestigious,

19:57.297 --> 19:59.632
so big collectors in museums
just aren't interested in it.

19:59.632 --> 20:03.069
And that means this small group
of ultra wealthy investors

20:03.069 --> 20:06.138
ends up defining
what fine art is.

20:06.138 --> 20:09.709
So the fine art world
is all a lie,

20:09.709 --> 20:11.711
and it's all about money

20:11.711 --> 20:15.382
and who gets into this
stupid snobby club?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.817
More or less.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.719
That's it!

20:19.719 --> 20:24.391
I just wanted to make something
true and original and good!

20:24.391 --> 20:27.059
But I don't know what's good and
originality is fake!

20:27.059 --> 20:29.296
And art has nothing
to do with truth!

20:29.296 --> 20:30.930
I can't do this anymore!

20:30.930 --> 20:32.299
I'm just gonna drop out
of art school

20:32.299 --> 20:34.301
and get an MBA
like my dad wanted!

20:34.301 --> 20:35.234
Wait!

20:37.804 --> 20:39.572
(crash)

20:39.572 --> 20:42.008
Hey!
Performance art!

20:45.345 --> 20:49.181
(crash)

20:49.181 --> 20:50.683
Hello, welcome to behind
the scenes here

20:50.683 --> 20:52.118
on "Adam Ruins Everything."

20:52.118 --> 20:54.153
I'm here with Megan Fenton, our
show's production designer.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.855
Hello.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.324
What does production designer
mean, for the folks at home?

20:57.324 --> 20:58.758
Well, on this show,

20:58.758 --> 21:02.595
we are kind of creating the look
in the world of Adam.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.431
Like, in this episode,
your team created

21:04.431 --> 21:06.799
all of the paintings
and the artworks, right?
Yes.

21:06.799 --> 21:10.370
We create, we reproduce,
we do all kinds of stuff.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.940
So you guys did, like, for
instance, the balloon animal?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.442
Is there a story behind that?

21:15.442 --> 21:17.209
Well, that was kind of a tricky
one, because, you know,

21:17.209 --> 21:18.945
we're doing a little bit
of a parody,

21:18.945 --> 21:20.347
but we don't want
to cross a line

21:20.347 --> 21:22.048
where we're really
too specific there,

21:22.048 --> 21:26.018
so that was a collaboration
between us and clearance.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.388
And we want to give people
the idea of a Jeff Koons

21:28.388 --> 21:30.957
without them thinking
that it is one.

21:30.957 --> 21:31.891
And I think we succeeded.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.393
My understanding is
you guys did

21:33.393 --> 21:36.128
a lot of nude figure
drawings of me?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.997
Yeah, and we did
a lot of research,

21:37.997 --> 21:39.732
did a lot of Googling.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.734
We went to set and there were,
like, a million different

21:41.734 --> 21:45.071
beautiful nude sketches of me
going like this.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.172
Some with hair,
some without.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.540
Yeah, some were
kinda gestural.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.208
And I was like, when did you
guys draw these?

21:49.208 --> 21:51.143
And someone was like, oh, we all
got together and we had

21:51.143 --> 21:52.979
a couple of glasses of wine and
we all just drew you nude.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.013
We did.
It was lovely.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.848
This is a really weird show
to work on.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.183
It is a really--

21:57.183 --> 21:58.485
I mean, there's something
different every time.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.819
Yeah.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.355
And we're fast-paced
and we are all over the place,

22:02.355 --> 22:04.491
and the subject matter
is never the same,

22:04.491 --> 22:06.025
which is really, really fun.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.160
Well, thank you so much for
being here, Megan.
My pleasure.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.662
And thank you so much for
working on the show.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.330
Of course.
It's been a journey.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.899
Wild ride.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.001
And now back to
"Adam Ruins Everything."

22:18.037 --> 22:20.673
I'm done trying to be
a great artist.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.908
If it's all about money,

22:21.908 --> 22:23.376
then why didn't I just
go to business school?

22:23.376 --> 22:26.613
Next time I'm in a gallery,
it'll be with my finance bros

22:26.613 --> 22:28.415
picking out décor
for my cigar room.

22:28.415 --> 22:31.017
Persephone, please don't quit.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.852
You can still be
a great artist.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.388
I want to make art
that people will see.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.856
Art that matters.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.026
Well, despite what a few
pretentious rich guys
want you to think,

22:40.026 --> 22:42.429
the fine art market
doesn't matter.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.397
Art is so much more than that.

22:44.397 --> 22:46.198
In fact, it's all around us.

22:46.198 --> 22:51.904
Movies, TV, music, video games,
graffiti, comic books.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.806
It's all art.

22:53.806 --> 22:56.075
I thought that was all just
commercial crap.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.144
Yeah, well, yesterday's
commercial crap

22:58.144 --> 22:59.979
is today's fine art.

22:59.979 --> 23:03.115
You know, in the 19th century,
opera was pop music

23:03.115 --> 23:06.218
and Shakespeare was originally
theater for the masses.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.556
Some of the greatest art
ever made was commercial.

23:09.556 --> 23:13.159
The point is, stop letting
other people tell you

23:13.159 --> 23:15.462
what is and isn't
worth making.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.731
It doesn't matter if you're
painting abstract impressionism

23:18.731 --> 23:20.600
or drawing comic books.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.669
If what you make
comes from the heart

23:22.669 --> 23:24.804
and brings joy
to other people,

23:24.804 --> 23:26.606
then you're making great art.

23:26.606 --> 23:27.674
Huh.

23:29.275 --> 23:30.443
Makes sense.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.680
Adam, would you mind popping
back up there for me?

23:33.680 --> 23:35.515
I want to sketch something out
really quick.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.016
Really?
Sure.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.586
Suit on this time or...

23:39.586 --> 23:41.120
Yes, please.
Of course.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.991
Oh, no, Persephone.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.258
You've gone backwards.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.761
How will want these doodles?

23:48.761 --> 23:51.163
You're embarrassing me
in front of Flamian.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.466
This is... awesome.

23:53.466 --> 23:54.601
Is it yours?

23:54.601 --> 23:56.268
Reminds of me Jack Kirby.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.436
You read comics?

23:57.436 --> 23:58.938
Ever since I was a boy.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.840
Is it for sale?

24:00.840 --> 24:02.274
I'm afraid not.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.876
I can respect that.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.277
You know, I have
a friend at Marvel

24:05.277 --> 24:06.946
who's looking for
a new artist.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.180
Maybe I'll give him a call.

24:08.180 --> 24:11.150
You know, Flamian,
I've always found

24:11.150 --> 24:13.285
the comic arts
extremely potent!

24:13.285 --> 24:14.787
Wow, cool!

24:14.787 --> 24:16.823
I always wondered what it would
be like to have a muscle.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.025
Here, Adam.
I want you to have this.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.226
To say thank you.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.829
I don't know what to say.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.230
I know!

24:24.230 --> 24:27.700
I insist you have my
masterpiece.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.701
Oh!

24:28.701 --> 24:30.703
Oh...

24:30.703 --> 24:33.039
Oh, I think I see some shrimp
over there! I'll be right back.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.474
I understand.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.644
I also like shrimp.
