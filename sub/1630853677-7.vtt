00:04.963 --> 00:08.258
♪

00:09.510 --> 00:11.970
Oh, your parents put out
a birthday balloon for you.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.765
I can't believe it took us
over an hour to get here.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.184
I can't believe you kept
intentionally giving me the wrong address.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.729
Full disclosure, I'm very excited

00:20.729 --> 00:23.524
and also very terrified
for you to meet my parents.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.608
Oh, don't worry.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.360
At this point,
the worst thing that can happen

00:26.360 --> 00:27.736
is they like me more than you do.

00:30.239 --> 00:32.824
- Well, that's when Maggie had
her headgear removed.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.952
Other kids would see her and scream.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.079
What you got going on downstairs?

00:37.079 --> 00:38.580
Wow. You threw that right in my face.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.916
Great, great, great party.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.544
-Oh.
- It's over. Maria, forget it.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.004
You know what else could be fun?

00:46.004 --> 00:48.590
- Hmm?
- If we leave the party before it starts

00:48.590 --> 00:51.552
and set the world record
for the most Irish Irish exit.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.221
- I know this may be hard
for you to believe,

00:54.221 --> 00:57.349
but I'm actually excited
to learn where you came from.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.940
See! We're making memories already!

01:08.569 --> 01:10.612
Mom! Turn it off!

01:10.612 --> 01:12.447
I have no idea how to turn that off.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.449
-Happy birthday!
-It's so loud.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.326
Why is the alarm even set?

01:16.326 --> 01:17.911
We're having people over.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.330
- Well, yeah,
I wanted everyone to feel safe.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.541
- Do you feel safe?
- I feel like I'm robbing a safe.

01:22.541 --> 01:23.876
- Mm-hmm.

01:23.876 --> 01:24.960
Ah.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.504
Guys, hi,

01:27.504 --> 01:28.881
this is Daniel--

01:28.881 --> 01:31.133
- Jack, get the phone.
It's probably the alarm company.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.092
You have to get them the password.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.468
Otherwise, they send
someone out to make sure

01:33.468 --> 01:34.720
we're not being murdered.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.929
Or worse.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.681
What's worse than being murdered?

01:37.681 --> 01:39.099
Oh, thank you, Daniel.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.935
I've heard almost nothing about you,

01:41.935 --> 01:44.730
but that says more about
my daughter than about you.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.356
That. That is worse.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.025
So this is my mom.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.943
Oh please. Mom was my mother's name.

01:49.943 --> 01:53.614
- Fine. Hold it one second.
Um, Maria, the password?

01:54.031 --> 01:57.284
- It's a... Oh shoot.
Uh, what did we tell the man?

01:57.284 --> 01:58.202
What man?

01:58.202 --> 02:00.621
- The man. The security man.
He came to install it.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.081
We were out back.
We told him the password.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.374
Oh shoot.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.626
Uh, what was it?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.169
Okay. Okay, you know what?

02:07.169 --> 02:08.504
I'm going to have to call you back,

02:08.504 --> 02:10.631
uh, but I promise you
we're not about to be murdered.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.049
Yeah, I know.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.093
That does sound like something
a murderer would say, doesn't it?

02:15.093 --> 02:17.554
But would he say this? Toodles!

02:20.474 --> 02:23.185
- Wow. Our landlords have
a very nice place.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.312
- I keep forgetting that Jack's a doctor.
- I know.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.023
He strikes me as a guy
who just hangs out in the park.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.566
- Hi, everybody.
Hello.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.526
Sorry we're late.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.444
- Oh, a bottle of wine
for the birthday girl, huh?

02:32.444 --> 02:33.820
Ooh.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.739
- The birthday girl?
It's, it's Maggie's birthday?

02:36.406 --> 02:38.116
Oh, I did not know that.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.826
I thought this was just
like a dinner party,

02:39.826 --> 02:41.203
and I thought it was weird
we were invited.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.081
Good thing we bought a bottle of wine.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.416
- I just invested
in this vineyard up in Napa.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.126
It's a micro micro vineyard.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.711
This is one of only three bottles.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.964
- Babe, that was supposed
to be the gift for Maggie.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.674
- It was? Oh.
Yes.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.467
- Just put our name
on whatever you brought.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.678
- Sorry. You don't get
to just waltz in and take credit.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.388
Our gift is super thoughtful.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.306
Oh. What did you get her?

03:01.306 --> 03:02.683
- I don't know.
Ben, what do we get her?

03:02.683 --> 03:03.559
Hmm.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.769
We got her a vintage book on the occult

03:05.769 --> 03:08.730
that we found on one
of my solo walks downtown.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.608
- I just fell asleep. That was so boring.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.068
- Hey, guys.
Hey.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.028
Hey, happy birthday.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.072
- Thank you.
Oh, Lou, you got me a candle.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.116
- It smells like the lip smackers
you used to eat.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.993
Ooh.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.327
Delicious.

03:22.327 --> 03:25.247
Angel, thank you for respecting
our no gifts rule.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.332
- To be clear,
I am not in favor of that rule.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.667
And I like cash.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.294
Maggie, happy birthday.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.129
This is from only us.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.047
- Oh my gosh.
Thank you so much for the book.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.382
I'm flattered you think I read.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.593
Uh, you didn't even open it yet.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.386
I do, in about a week.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.889
- Well, ours isn't here yet.
It's coming soon.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.682
- Yeah, in our defense,
we didn't know it was your birthday.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.726
- Don't even worry about it.
You guys don't have to get me anything.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.978
- Oh good.
- I do have to go rescue Daniel, though.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.688
I think he's with my parents.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.107
I, I don't get it.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.109
I mean, where's the fun
in getting Maggie a gift

03:54.109 --> 03:55.444
if she already knows what it is.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.613
It's very hard to surprise a psychic.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.406
It's one of the many reasons
I've never been impressed

03:59.406 --> 04:00.616
by Mr. Night Shyamalan.

04:00.616 --> 04:01.450
Hmm.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.744
- I bet I could surprise her. Mm-hmm.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.913
I've been told that my energy
really throws people off.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.706
And that's why we switched therapists.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.958
- Ooh. Ooh. How about
we make a game of it?

04:10.501 --> 04:13.837
Whoever surprises
the birthday girl first wins.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.881
Yes. I love games. Maybe too much.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.258
Which is why we can't keep them
at our place anymore.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.052
- Well, she bit me
the last time we played Scrabble,

04:20.052 --> 04:21.303
so I'm on her team.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.430
- I pick Amy.
- Aww. Are you playing?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.223
No.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.933
- Dammit.
Okay, you're my first choice, babe.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.559
- Oh hey!
- I'm bringing my beer.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.271
What are you talking about?

04:31.271 --> 04:32.981
You can totally surprise a psychic.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.984
Maggie's literally shocked every time
she sees how long my toenails are.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.237
- Well, of course,
you can surprise a psychic.

04:38.237 --> 04:40.322
I walked into a glass door this morning.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.866
I just wanted to see
what kind of birthday surprises

04:42.866 --> 04:44.117
these crazy kids come up with.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.037
Oh, Angel, that's really sweet.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.290
- It sprouted out of boredom,
but it ripened into sweetness.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.459
You talk like a book.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.086
I talk like a play.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.799
Dad. You ran away earlier.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.217
This is Daniel.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.220
- Oh yeah. I'm sorry about that.
Hi, Daniel. Welcome.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.556
Boy, you know, it's kind of odd.

05:05.556 --> 05:09.726
The way Maggie described you,
you seemed taller.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.020
Maggie talked about him to you?

05:12.020 --> 05:14.398
- Oh yeah. We went out
for ice cream together,

05:14.398 --> 05:16.525
and she was telling me
all about her new boyfriend

05:16.525 --> 05:19.152
and how handsome and charming he is.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.612
And, I don't know,

05:20.612 --> 05:22.948
I kind of equate qualities
like that with someone

05:23.699 --> 05:26.743
six-two, six-three, something like that.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.120
I love ice cream, Daniel.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.706
Why wasn't I invited to ice cream?

05:31.123 --> 05:35.002
- Oh, uh, sorry, I don't know.
I wasn't part of the ice cream getting.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.920
I think that was just
your husband and daughter.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.256
Wow. You threw that right in my face.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.634
Okay, I think that's enough for now.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.760
Okay.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.678
Sure.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.849
- Ooh. Well, you have
officially met my parents,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.309
and we're still standing.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.060
I do have to warn you, though,

05:52.060 --> 05:54.897
um, I saw some embarrassing things
go wrong later.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.274
Nothing big. But, you know,
just so that you're prepared--

05:57.274 --> 05:58.650
- Hey, hey. Let's not worry about
the future right now.

05:58.650 --> 05:59.693
- Okay.
- Okay?

05:59.693 --> 06:03.322
Now let's focus on the present.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.323
Okay.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.202
Oh my god, is this a cookie?

06:08.202 --> 06:09.077
- Mm-hmm.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.872
Well, I mean, you gave me one when we met,

06:11.872 --> 06:14.041
so I thought I'd return the favor.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.420
- I feel like
the Cookie Monster's girlfriend.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.380
Well, I mean, in a way, you kinda are.

06:22.674 --> 06:23.926
So you really like it?

06:31.517 --> 06:33.560
- I got a call about
a security alarm going off.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.687
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.357
My husband forgot the password
to our new alarm.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.777
Yes, I know your husband.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.863
- That's right. Officer Kantor
is the guy who came over

06:44.863 --> 06:46.990
when I was trapped
on the roof in my underwear.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.285
Before you roll your eyes
back there, I had a good reason.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.912
Thought my pants were up there.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.455
I suggest you find your password.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.707
If I'm called out again,
you'll be charged a fine.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.167
Thank you, Officer.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.378
Would you like to stay
for my daughter's birthday?

06:59.378 --> 07:02.130
Full disclosure, I caught her
smoking marijuana in high school,

07:02.130 --> 07:04.174
but she is clean now.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.760
- Mom. Would you like to share
where I found that joint?

07:07.302 --> 07:09.137
She also does comedy.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.597
Yeah.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.475
- If I'm going to Vegas,
the only thing I'll bet is Midler.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.271
- Hello?
- Oh hello, necklace.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.606
- Oh my gosh. It's from Daniel.
It's a cookie.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.317
Oh, wow. Oh, we like him.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.153
- I know. He's passing
every test imaginable.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.698
Lou, I can't believe I'm saying this,

07:27.698 --> 07:32.619
but... I think I might
actually be in love.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.664
Mags, this is great news!

07:35.664 --> 07:36.707
Are you going to tell him?

07:36.707 --> 07:39.459
- I don't know. It'd have to be
the right moment, you know.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.879
I'm freaking out, Lou. I've never said it.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.965
Girl, what you're feeling right now,

07:44.965 --> 07:47.926
that's the stuff that makes life so good.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.512
You should tell him. This is a safe space.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.722
- Gah!

07:52.806 --> 07:54.224
Ha, ha!

07:54.224 --> 07:56.226
Oh, guys, I won.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.021
- What was that?
- Uh, don't ask.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.355
Ohh.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.570
- Okay. I did it.
I scared the crap out of Maggie.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.654
So what do I win?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.698
- Nothing.
- What? Why?

08:09.698 --> 08:12.367
- Yeah, we agreed the first person
who surprises Maggie wins.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.744
She was pretty surprised by that cop.

08:13.744 --> 08:14.953
Did that make him the winner?

08:14.953 --> 08:17.456
- Hey, Dave, did I miss the cop
joining our team?

08:17.456 --> 08:19.374
- No? Then shut it down.
- Oh.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.668
- Y'all, the game
is not about scaring Maggie.

08:21.668 --> 08:25.005
It's about making her birthday better
with a delightfully unexpected gift.

08:25.547 --> 08:26.882
Have you no whimsy?

08:26.882 --> 08:28.300
Oh, I have whimsy.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.219
I have more whimsy than anyone else here.

08:30.219 --> 08:31.803
My car's headlights
have eyelashes on them.

08:31.803 --> 08:32.971
Oh.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.389
You're driving me home.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.891
- I would be honored.
- Yeah.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.853
I don't understand.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.231
If the alarm goes off,

08:42.231 --> 08:45.442
why can't we give them
the code we punch in.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.362
- Could you please explain
to her that the code, honey,

08:48.362 --> 08:49.863
it's not our password.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.740
The password is a word.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.910
The code is numbers.
It's really quite simple.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.204
Then what is our code?

08:57.204 --> 09:00.958
- Ah, well, I'm glad you asked.
I wrote it down somewhere.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.794
- Guys, can we talk about
literally anything else?

09:03.794 --> 09:04.586
I got this.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.965
Hey, do you guys have
baby pictures of Maggie I can see?

09:08.423 --> 09:10.551
- That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever asked me.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.472
- I think I love him.
- I know the feeling.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.309
Careful what you wish for.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.770
Pink album. That's a real classic.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.105
- Is it? Okay.
- Oh yeah.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.440
Ohh!

09:25.440 --> 09:27.234
What is going on here?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.695
- Well, that's when Maggie had
her headgear removed.

09:29.695 --> 09:30.571
Remember that, honey?

09:30.571 --> 09:31.822
You had to wear all that headgear

09:31.822 --> 09:33.282
because of your weird, crumbly tooth.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.533
I do.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.326
Her teeth came in sideways.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.328
Other kids would see her and scream.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.623
It was traumatizing.
Probably for her, too.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.458
Well, I'm glad it got straightened out.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.545
That's a fun turn of phrase.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.756
So funny.

09:50.883 --> 09:53.468
My parents are obsessed with you.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.971
I keep seeing my mom taking photos of you

09:55.971 --> 09:57.014
when you're not looking.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.891
- Okay, but I'm going to need
final approval on anything

09:58.891 --> 09:59.850
that she wants to post.

09:59.850 --> 10:00.809
Oh, you are funny.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.230
- Alright, guys. Any ideas
on how to surprise her?

10:05.230 --> 10:08.066
Actually, no ideas is my strategy.

10:08.066 --> 10:11.028
- Oh, that sounds convoluted, babe.
Do tell.

10:11.028 --> 10:13.447
- Well, I figure we're going
to get her a gift,

10:13.447 --> 10:15.282
but the sooner I think of that gift,

10:15.282 --> 10:16.700
the more time Maggie has

10:16.700 --> 10:18.827
to go out and have a vision of that gift.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.663
If I don't have an idea,
she can't see it coming

10:21.663 --> 10:23.874
until I do have an idea
and I immediately buy it

10:23.874 --> 10:25.459
before she can even have a vision of it.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.252
Ugh. Not thinking.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.795
- That is so smart.
Thank you.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.173
- Do they really think
psychics can read minds?

10:31.173 --> 10:33.050
I mean, honestly.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.594
Yeah. So dumb.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.304
Like, I'm thinking of a number right now.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.431
You probably don't know what it is, right?

10:39.431 --> 10:42.017
- Pardon me. I'm going in
for a second helping of fun.

10:42.935 --> 10:43.810
Twelve.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.605
- Oh, I have an idea for a gift.
- She already has one of those.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.525
- She has an ashtray I made her
at Color Me Mine?

10:49.858 --> 10:51.735
- What doesn't she have?
- We're going to lose.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.489
What happened?

10:55.489 --> 10:56.949
Did you eat the cookie off your necklace?

10:57.533 --> 10:59.451
Oh no. It must have just turned.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.994
- Oh no. Yeah.
- Can you get it?

11:01.870 --> 11:04.998
- You know, I heard that
when this sort of thing happens,

11:05.499 --> 11:07.334
you are supposed to make a wish.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.293
Oh.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.673
Well, I'm not sure what I would wish for.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.592
I'm pretty happy with
what's right in front of me.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.719
Yeah?

11:18.303 --> 11:18.971
Me, too.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.724
- I--
- Danno!

11:22.724 --> 11:24.059
Hey, hey, hey.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.145
What you got going on downstairs?

11:28.230 --> 11:30.399
- Your feet. He means your feet.
He's a podiatrist.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.735
- Not just a podiatrist.
A foot enthusiast.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.153
But not in a pervy way.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.656
Those guys are friggin' weird, right?

11:37.656 --> 11:40.117
- Yeah.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.077
- Okay, let's pop off
the old Hush Puppies.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.328
Dad.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.831
I think I heard Mom calling you.
She sounds mad.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.166
- No. Really?
- Yeah.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.419
Okay. Well, I better get going then.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.754
I don't need to tell you who wears
the shoes in this household, right?

11:55.507 --> 11:56.258
Oh.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.135
Well, where were we?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.929
- I think we were having
a private, romantic moment.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.055
Yeah.

12:07.686 --> 12:08.687
Don't mind me.

12:10.189 --> 12:12.733
- You know what? At this point,
I'm gonna go show my feet to your dad.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.692
Okay.

12:17.738 --> 12:18.989
Okay. People. Shh, shh, shh!

12:18.989 --> 12:21.074
People.
Maggie is coming.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.327
Now, if you really want
to surprise her, clear your mind.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.287
Otherwise, she's gonna read
whatever thoughts you're having.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.914
Hey, guys.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.248
- How's it going?
- Hey.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.460
- Sorry about scaring you earlier.
I didn't understand the rules.

12:31.877 --> 12:32.753
Rules for what?

12:34.421 --> 12:35.547
I've said too much.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.841
Right.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.470
Can I get anyone anything?

12:42.054 --> 12:42.888
Go away.

12:44.223 --> 12:47.059
- Okay.
- Great, great, great party.

12:47.518 --> 12:48.852
I actually think that worked.

12:51.897 --> 12:54.983
- How's the game going?
- Not as sophisticated as I'd hoped.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.319
Ew, this is not my Fanta.

13:01.990 --> 13:02.908
Oh hey.

13:02.908 --> 13:05.077
- Hey, man. It's great party, huh?
- Yeah.

13:05.077 --> 13:07.621
Yeah, yeah. I always thought
Maggie hated parties,

13:07.621 --> 13:09.331
but she seems to be having a great time.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.500
- Yeah, she's the best.
- Yeah.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.709
And good news.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.129
She must see you in her future
if she's keeping you around, huh?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.674
- Yeah, maybe.
I hope so. I mean, I don't know.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.051
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothing.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.975
Well, it's just like sometimes I think
that she puts too much weight

13:27.975 --> 13:30.143
on what she thinks is going to happen.

13:31.103 --> 13:32.980
- Well, to be fair, she knows
what's going to happen.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.731
Right.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.904
- You do believe that Maggie's
a psychic, right?

13:43.615 --> 13:45.868
- I mean, come on. Come on, man.
What do you want me to say?

13:49.538 --> 13:50.330
Oh!

13:51.248 --> 13:52.875
My chicken.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.127
- Chicken. Thank god.
I thought it was a ham.

13:56.545 --> 13:57.421
Oh.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.758
Jack, is our smoke alarm connected
to our security alarm?

14:01.758 --> 14:02.885
- Yeah, of course it--

14:03.760 --> 14:06.388
Without the password,
they're going to charge us.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.932
Oh, it's over, Maria. Forget it.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.643
Oh, I hate the security system.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.103
I hate the automatic locks.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.480
I hate the cameras.
I hate the peace of mind.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.899
Oh my god, Jack, shut up.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.942
The cameras, they're everywhere,

14:19.526 --> 14:21.695
even on the back patio.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.696
- Uh-huh.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.781
- Where we were with the guy--

14:24.781 --> 14:25.866
Yeah?

14:25.866 --> 14:28.368
- Which is when we told him--

14:28.368 --> 14:30.621
- I'm clearly not getting this. What are--
- Our password!

14:30.621 --> 14:32.247
If we can find the footage,
we'd know our password,

14:32.247 --> 14:33.790
and we can call the security company.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.125
We need to find that footage right now.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.254
Oh no.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.088
Oh.

14:42.216 --> 14:45.469
- I feel like this is my fault
because I asked my mom to cook.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.763
Well, let's skip to cake.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.891
Why don't you go into the other room

14:51.266 --> 14:53.435
and get ready to act surprised?

14:54.770 --> 14:56.355
- That was good.
- Yeah.

14:56.355 --> 14:57.564
- That was really good.
- Mm-hmm.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.984
- Okay. The TV is supposed
to be on input three.

15:00.984 --> 15:01.902
Okay.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.029
I have no idea what that means.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.323
- Oh, I got it. I got it.
I just thought of it.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.159
I got a surprise for Maggie.
It just fell right into my head.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.036
Okay, shh. Don't think. Just move.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.830
- Wait, where are they going?
What are they doing?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.666
- Well, how should I know?
I'm talking to you.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.251
Where the hell is the damn input?

15:17.251 --> 15:19.962
- Is it next to output?
- Next to the output? I--

15:19.962 --> 15:22.381
Why-- Oh yeah, it is, right here. Okay.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.134
- Hey, how's it going?
You drop the L-bomb on Daniel yet?

15:26.885 --> 15:28.136
We keep getting interrupted,

15:28.136 --> 15:31.139
but the bomb is in my holster,

15:31.139 --> 15:33.225
and I clearly do not know
how weapons work.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.810
- No, you don't.
- Hey.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.396
You good? You okay?

15:37.396 --> 15:40.107
- Yeah. Yeah, I was just,
uh, talking to Daniel.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.984
Oh, oh, a little bit of boy gossip, huh?

15:41.984 --> 15:44.111
About this little lady right here.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.154
What did he say?

15:46.154 --> 15:48.991
- Uh--
- Okay. Come to Papa.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.450
That's not the security guy.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.662
-Are you sure?
- Would you excuse me for a second?

15:53.662 --> 15:55.455
- Hey, can I see that for a second?
- What?

15:55.455 --> 15:56.915
No, no, no, no, we just got it working.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.334
- Yeah. Come on.
We know what we're doing here.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.669
How do you get the picture to move?

16:01.044 --> 16:04.923
<i>- In all fairness, she knows
what is going to happen.</i>

16:06.091 --> 16:07.050
- <i>Right.</i>
<i>Right.</i>

16:08.093 --> 16:11.221
<i>I mean, you do believe
Maggie's a psychic, right?</i>

16:14.391 --> 16:16.602
<i>- I mean, come on. Come on, man.
What do you want me to say?</i>

16:24.193 --> 16:25.819
Everybody now!

16:30.324 --> 16:31.950
- We got you a whale-watching trip.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.537
She has already been surprised.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.040
- Dammit
- Was it an ashtray?

16:44.379 --> 16:46.840
- Maggie. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.468
- If you don't believe I'm a psychic,
then what do you believe?

16:49.468 --> 16:51.470
You, you, you think I'm crazy?

16:51.470 --> 16:52.721
Of course, I don't.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.350
Look...

16:56.350 --> 16:59.394
Whether you can actually see
the future or not is irrelevant.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.063
What I see

17:01.563 --> 17:04.316
is that it's making
your life really, really hard.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.736
I can see the future, Daniel.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.863
And I always will.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.198
Okay. Well, I don't care about that.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.659
I care about tonight, right now,

17:13.659 --> 17:15.410
because we are having a great time.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.539
Maggie, please. Please.

17:18.914 --> 17:20.499
Let's not ruin this.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.839
- This is the vision
that I had of us fighting.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.092
Oh my god.
It wasn't Amy's dress, it was this dress.

17:31.927 --> 17:33.011
You're kidding, right?

17:34.763 --> 17:36.515
You're doing this now. I mean--

17:37.641 --> 17:39.768
I don't know, I just don't think
our whole lives need to revolve

17:39.768 --> 17:41.186
around your visions.
That's all.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.564
That's not an option for me.

17:45.274 --> 17:46.066
And what about you?

17:46.066 --> 17:49.653
When, when, when were you going
to tell me that you felt this way?

17:49.653 --> 17:51.154
- I didn't think it mattered.
- Why not?

17:51.154 --> 17:52.155
Because I love you.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.995
You don't even know me.

17:58.912 --> 17:59.872
Maggie.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.126
You should go home.

18:06.628 --> 18:07.713
This is over.

18:08.338 --> 18:11.967
♪

18:23.061 --> 18:25.856
I'm so sorry about tonight, sweetheart.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.691
You want to talk about it?

18:27.691 --> 18:29.276
That's okay. Thanks.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.612
- You know something, honey?
I could-- I could tell, uh,

18:31.612 --> 18:34.031
feet-wise, bad, really bad.

18:34.031 --> 18:34.907
Hmm.

18:37.492 --> 18:38.577
You know we're here.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.084
This sucks.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.421
Maybe this will help.

18:49.838 --> 18:50.839
Surprise.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.217
That's not really how surprises work.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.510
I already know it's a candle.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.512
It's a cake.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.472
Happy birthday.

19:00.599 --> 19:01.725
Oh my god. That's--

19:02.434 --> 19:03.936
I had no idea. That's really cool.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.981
Hey, Angel.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.900
So we've been talking, and--

19:09.900 --> 19:12.611
- And not to be that guy.
- Totally. Not to be that guy.

19:12.611 --> 19:16.281
But we are not really sure
that Daniel betraying Maggie counts

19:16.281 --> 19:17.449
as a good surprise.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.701
- Which, just to remind you,
was your rule.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.162
- Uh-huh. And you were
very condescending about it.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.498
Louise's candle was a cake.

19:24.915 --> 19:26.208
She wins.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.960
- Dammit!
- That's whimsical as hell.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.212
- Ugh!
- No contest.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.213
Ohh!

19:31.672 --> 19:32.589
Sorry.

19:37.553 --> 19:38.971
- I love it.
- It looks pretty.

19:38.971 --> 19:39.805
Yeah.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.184
- I really thought
he might be the one.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.063
Honestly. If not him, then who?

19:49.648 --> 19:50.607
Hi, Maggie.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.319
Uh, just wondering if cake might help.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.696
Cut you a corner piece.

19:55.696 --> 19:57.781
- Wow. My girl is out here
dealing with this,

19:57.781 --> 19:59.283
and you're in there cutting cake?

20:00.117 --> 20:01.702
-I--
- You can go.

20:01.702 --> 20:02.619
Okay. Thank you.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.171
- You know, I always thought
he was a jerk.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.257
- Really?
- No. I was completely blindsided.

20:16.592 --> 20:17.634
Here.

20:21.805 --> 20:22.639
Happy birthday.

20:23.849 --> 20:24.683
Thank you.

20:28.187 --> 20:29.146
You missed it.

20:30.147 --> 20:31.064
- Oh!
- Oh.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.733
Oh, you missed it.

20:35.194 --> 20:36.236
You sure you're okay?

20:37.362 --> 20:38.197
- I mean--

20:38.197 --> 20:40.782
- I just ask because I thought
I saw you eat a candle.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.534
- I did.
- You did?

20:44.203 --> 20:45.954
It wasn't all it's cracked up to be.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.372
I imagine.

20:56.632 --> 20:58.592
- Okay. So what do you want
your password to be?

20:59.176 --> 21:00.219
Uh, password.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.888
I would suggest something stronger.

21:02.888 --> 21:04.181
Ooh, like whiskey.

21:04.181 --> 21:06.308
Whoa. Maria, are we drinking already?

21:06.308 --> 21:07.976
We just need to pick a password.

21:09.061 --> 21:10.729
How about my meemaw's birthday?

21:10.729 --> 21:13.774
That was January 23rd, 1945.

21:13.774 --> 21:15.025
Yeah.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.944
So one, two, three, four, five.

21:16.944 --> 21:18.779
Oh, that's easy to remember.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.156
- I wasn't even listening.
All I'm thinking about is that drink.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.450
- Ah, I'll make three.
You're not going anywhere.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.369
Okay. I'll put on some music.

21:30.249 --> 21:31.208
Password's good.

21:34.711 --> 21:38.715
