{\an8}You're her friend, Marcus?

00:16.149 --> 00:17.450
{\an7}You know.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.686
{\an8}(Brooke)
You know, I've had
conversations

00:19.753 --> 00:21.421
{\an8}about getting
a breast reduction.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.421
{\an4}Yeah.

00:21.488 --> 00:25.125
{\an8}The doctor basically told me
that I had lumps.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.894
{\an8}Are they cancerous?

00:27.961 --> 00:29.896
{\an8}I know for a fact...

00:27.961 --> 00:29.896
{\an7}Yeah.

00:29.963 --> 00:32.732
{\an8}Lyrica was trying to
(bleep) my friend Safaree.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.934

K. Michelle!

00:35.001 --> 00:36.503
{\an8}Baby, what's going on?

00:36.569 --> 00:38.304
{\an8}'Cause she is wreaking
havoc in my life

00:38.371 --> 00:39.639
{\an8}and in my daughter's life.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.341
{\an7}Ain't your daughter messin'

00:41.408 --> 00:43.042
{\an9}Hell no!

00:41.408 --> 00:43.042

00:43.109 --> 00:45.245

00:45.311 --> 00:46.513

00:46.579 --> 00:49.249
{\an8}I'm not doing this!

00:49.315 --> 00:50.717
{\an7}I'm not (bleep)
doing this.

00:50.784 --> 00:51.951
{\an8}This is your wife.

00:52.018 --> 00:54.454
{\an8}Don't come in here
accusing my (bleep) son

00:54.521 --> 00:56.256
{\an8}about (bleep) (bleep)!

00:56.322 --> 00:57.724
{\an7}Bottom line, bro,

02:04.824 --> 02:07.527
{\an8}I'm shooting my music video
for "Vacation" today,

02:07.594 --> 02:10.363

Look, let me see that.
Thank you, thank you.

Next setup, please!

02:17.003 --> 02:18.371

{\an5}No, you good, baby.

02:18.438 --> 02:19.906
Okay, okay, okay.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.141
{\an8}Can you taste 'em?

02:22.208 --> 02:23.276
{\an8}I got lipstick on me?

02:23.343 --> 02:25.278
{\an7}No!

02:23.343 --> 02:25.278
{\an8}No, you're good.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.947
Oh, yes, honey, my man Akbar
is super successful.

02:28.014 --> 02:31.518
He has a gym, a studio,
a production company,

02:31.584 --> 02:33.920
and he's even directing
my music video.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.489
We met two years ago
and then reconnected

02:36.556 --> 02:38.124
when I came home from rehab.

02:38.191 --> 02:40.527
He's exactly what I want
in my life right now.

02:40.593 --> 02:41.961
How you feeling?
You feel good?

02:42.028 --> 02:44.531
{\an4}I feel good.
I'm happy to be back,
you know, doing it.

02:44.597 --> 02:45.798
{\an1}I reconnected
with Nikki.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.767
I went to the party,
hanging out with her.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.469
{\an3}You know...
You know...

02:49.536 --> 02:50.737
{\an1}What?
You don't even know her.

02:50.803 --> 02:52.739
I don't-- I know what
she about, though.

02:52.805 --> 02:54.140
Like, she's more
of a socialite.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.375
You got a career.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.310
You know, you have
a certain talent...

02:57.377 --> 02:59.345
{\an4}Right.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.345
...that she doesn't possess.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.581
{\an5}I just want you to stay
focused, stay on the--
on the right path.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.283
{\an3}That's it.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.283
{\an1}Okay.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.851
You know,
did you drink at all?

03:04.918 --> 03:06.519
No, not at that party.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.221
What you mean
"not at that party"?

03:08.288 --> 03:09.889
Like at another party
or something?

03:09.956 --> 03:11.024
{\an1}I got it,
okay, I'm good.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.259
{\an1}Everything is
under control, so...

03:13.326 --> 03:15.328
{\an1}I mean, you could be
okay with that.

03:15.395 --> 03:16.729
{\an6}I am, I am.

03:15.395 --> 03:16.729
'Cause I'm gonna go

03:16.796 --> 03:18.665
{\an1}to this other industry party
that Nikki invited me to.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.233
It's not what you think.

03:20.300 --> 03:23.236
{\an1}Like, she's not
as "wild" as you think.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.505
I don't get Akbar's
issues with Nikki.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.807
I mean, he's never
even met her,

03:27.874 --> 03:29.576
and out of all
of my friends,

03:29.642 --> 03:31.344
she's been one of the ones

03:31.411 --> 03:34.581
that has been by my side
through all my tough times.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.716
So you just going
to this party?

03:36.783 --> 03:39.252
{\an1}I just need to be out
a little bit more.

03:39.319 --> 03:41.688
{\an1}I've been in, like,
this cocoon with you.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.690
It's an industry event.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.391
{\an1}A lot of people
are gonna be there.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.327
{\an1}People who need to see
that I'm working.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.262
So how Nikki know these
people in the industry?

03:49.329 --> 03:50.763
She not even an "artist".

03:50.830 --> 03:52.632
{\an1}I mean, she gets invited
to industry events, though.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.367
{\an6}But--

03:52.699 --> 03:54.367
{\an1}It'll be
a good event to attend.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.902

05:01.434 --> 05:04.570
One hot topic I've been
desperate to ask Lyrica about

05:04.637 --> 05:06.673
is Sarafee's willy
that's been wandering

05:06.739 --> 05:08.741
all around

{\an8}is gonna be performing,
and believe me,

05:19.385 --> 05:21.354
{\an8}it's gonna blow your mind.

05:21.421 --> 05:24.023
Lyrica Anderson

I'm really, really excited

There's gonna be a lot
of females performing.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.700
{\an6}Awesome.

05:32.098 --> 05:33.700
I've been trying to

05:33.766 --> 05:36.135
put together these showcases,
and girls be getting catty.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.970
I just want to make sure this
time that there's no beef.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.372
Oh, you talking about
from the steps.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.074
Yeah, me and you had
our little--

05:41.140 --> 05:43.242
(laughing)
Funny conversation.

05:43.309 --> 05:44.744
Yeah, Lyrica kicked me out.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.646
{\an8}I feel horrible
about the little moment

05:46.713 --> 05:48.648
{\an8}that I had with Donatella
and her artist,

05:48.715 --> 05:50.149
{\an8}Angel Gold, last year.

05:50.216 --> 05:53.319
{\an1}There's no girl artists on
our label other than myself.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.288
We should perhaps
just, like, maybe,

05:55.354 --> 05:56.689
{\an1}do something another day
when it's not--

05:56.756 --> 05:58.458
Brah, it's not
happening, okay?

05:58.524 --> 05:59.592
{\an5}Relax.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.592
Excuse yourself!

05:59.659 --> 06:01.794
Get the (bleep)
and bye-bye.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.497
But that was more about
A1 working with other girls

06:04.564 --> 06:06.566
when we were supposed
to be wrapping my album.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.135
I let it go, and that's
what I love about Donatella.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.503
She let it go, too.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.971
Lyrica, I have to ask you

06:12.038 --> 06:13.206
{\an1}'cause this is
someone that you know

06:13.272 --> 06:15.575
{\an1}that broke
the Internet recently.

06:15.641 --> 06:18.044
{\an1}Safaree.

06:15.641 --> 06:18.044
{\an3}Oh, my God.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.912
He's been swinging his (bleep)

06:19.979 --> 06:22.081
Oh, my gosh, has he?

06:22.148 --> 06:24.150
Well, you know, my husband
has an amazing (bleep).

06:24.217 --> 06:27.153
{\an4}Oh!

06:24.217 --> 06:27.153

I like to focus on.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.921
I saw that (bleep).

06:28.988 --> 06:31.591
I wasn't impressed.

06:31.657 --> 06:32.825
{\an1}Mom, what have you
got going on?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.260
{\an1}Tell us some gossip,
what you've got going on.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.695
Well, I'm in the studio
working on my EP,

06:35.762 --> 06:37.630
but I do have

{\an1}I want to find out
your side.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.185
You come to a place
in your life

06:59.252 --> 07:00.553
where you decide

07:00.620 --> 07:02.789
that you don't speak, um,
peasants anymore.

07:02.855 --> 07:05.224
I know Lyrica
doesn't know this,

07:05.291 --> 07:07.326
but the other night,

07:07.393 --> 07:09.428
I rolled up
on K. Michelle.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.664
{\an1}Oh, wait, we just
got and exclusive on-air.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.499
{\an1}What do you mean
"rolled up"?

07:13.566 --> 07:14.834
She was performing.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.637
I went backstage
to try to get up.

07:17.703 --> 07:19.572
No, Mom, you can't do
(bleep) like that.

07:19.639 --> 07:22.842
She needs to reconcile
what she did.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.477
{\an5}She needs to apologize.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.477
You're not supposed
to call her, though.

07:24.544 --> 07:27.213
I appreciate
where my mother's heart is,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.782
but I wish she would've
left that stuff up to me.

07:29.849 --> 07:31.984
Giving life
to that industry (bleep) dump

07:32.051 --> 07:34.187
is literally making
my life worse right now.

07:34.253 --> 07:35.588
I appreciate
you loving me, caring,

07:35.655 --> 07:37.657
but at the end of the day,
like, you look stupid

07:37.723 --> 07:39.258
confronting K. Michelle.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.327
{\an5}Lyrica, I'm done.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.327
You look dumb
confronting K. Michelle.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.496
{\an5}I'm done, I'm done!

07:41.394 --> 07:43.496
Like, you look
stupid as (bleep).

07:43.563 --> 07:45.631
Like, how you gonna argue
with someone my age?

07:45.698 --> 07:46.999
Don't call
your mother stupid!

07:47.066 --> 07:48.534
{\an5}That looks dumb!

07:47.066 --> 07:48.534
Let's wrap this up.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.469
{\an5}Lyrica G, come back.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.469

a plus in my life

co-parenting with Moniece,

08:12.124 --> 08:14.493
{\an8}so I'm happy
to have her around.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.029
But A.D. just called

for a practice that he has,

08:19.765 --> 08:21.968

08:26.606 --> 08:28.274
Gotta deal with it all.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.475
{\an1}Yeah, speaking
of basketball, man,

08:29.542 --> 08:30.810
{\an1}I wanted to touch on that
just a little bit.

08:30.877 --> 08:32.178
{\an1}I know it's been
kind of frustrating

08:32.245 --> 08:34.280
{\an1}for both parties
a little bit.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.282
I just wanna keep him
in something,

08:36.349 --> 08:38.384
you know what I mean,
that I know he loves.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.553
{\an1}To be honest, like, he tells
his mom other things.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.155
{\an5}And that's the thing.
It's like he's saying
one thing there,

08:43.222 --> 08:45.091
he's telling me
another thing.

08:45.157 --> 08:48.060
{\an8}Thought I heard you.
Hey, ex-bestie.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.897
It's nice that me
and Moniece have moved on,

08:50.963 --> 08:53.900
but this is not how I wanted
A.D. to find out

08:53.966 --> 08:56.669
that I was dating
her ex-best-friend.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.804
I first saw Tiffany
last year,

08:58.871 --> 09:01.540
and I guess her and Moniece
were beefing or something.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.609
And I was like,
"Damn, who that?"

09:03.676 --> 09:06.245
I reconnected with her back
in New York and we just vibe.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.781
I can really talk to her,
be myself around her.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.584
Be goofy.
Sex is great.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.653
That's all goody for me.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.221
You know,
considering the fact

09:15.288 --> 09:16.956
that Moniece and Tiffany
have beef,

09:17.023 --> 09:19.358
I was waiting for the right
time to bring this up,

09:19.425 --> 09:21.861
but I guess
the right time is now.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.233
{\an7}Yo, what's good, man?
Is this, like, this real?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.001
It's as real
as you and Moniece.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.403
{\an1}Is this, like,
to hurt Moniece?

09:30.469 --> 09:31.570
{\an5}Listen, listen listen.

09:30.469 --> 09:31.570
Is this to hurt me?

09:31.637 --> 09:33.372
It's not to hurt anybody.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.041
{\an1}I feel you, but, like,
her coming down the stairs,

09:35.107 --> 09:36.642
{\an1}like me and you talking
about family stuff.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.511
{\an5}Sure.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.511
{\an1}That's years,
you know what I mean,

09:38.577 --> 09:39.912
{\an1}and some (bleep)
that went down was...

09:39.979 --> 09:41.480
Oh, you talking
about the years now?

09:41.547 --> 09:42.915
Keep it 100!

09:42.982 --> 09:45.084
{\an1}You tried to make it seem
like I cheated on Moniece...

09:45.151 --> 09:46.719
{\an1}Is that not what happened?
But that's not what happened?

09:46.786 --> 09:48.387
{\an1}No, I didn't cheat
on her, never!

09:48.454 --> 09:49.889
So I just manipulated
that whole situation?

09:49.956 --> 09:51.257
{\an5}Me and her were
broken up, girl.

When I used to confide
in Tiffany,

09:54.427 --> 09:56.696
I wasn't asking her
to break me and Moniece up,

09:56.762 --> 09:58.798
but she got messy.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.500
She had friend
and Alexis Skye dance up on me

10:01.567 --> 10:04.036

she chooses Dreux?

to get back at me.

behind what you're doing,

10:19.151 --> 10:21.087

relationship is super important.

14:38.277 --> 14:40.346
the way I know we're
supposed to be together.

14:40.412 --> 14:44.350
I'm sorry about
the bar situation,

14:44.416 --> 14:46.185
and I'm not proud
of the way I reacted.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.254
{\an4}Yeah.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.254
I didn't expect to see you

14:48.320 --> 14:49.888
there with a hot date.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.890
{\an7}I wish that you guys
maybe could've met

14:51.957 --> 14:54.526
{\an7}in a different fashion,
you know what I mean?

14:54.593 --> 14:55.995
{\an1}That's just--
That's somebody I just

14:56.061 --> 14:57.396
{\an1}been seeing
for a little while.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.065
{\an4}And, uh...

14:57.463 --> 15:00.065
Does she know you're
here right now?

15:00.132 --> 15:02.868
No, she doesn't, and I'd
like it to stay that way.

15:02.935 --> 15:04.036
When Brooke told me
to go out there

15:04.103 --> 15:06.238
and sow my royal oats,
I hit up Stassi,

15:06.305 --> 15:08.807
who's actually a girl
I've known for some time now.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.976
And I never felt any way
about it, 'cause, you know,

15:11.043 --> 15:12.878
I was just doing
what Brooke said go do.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.913
Let's get these lumps
out of the way first.

15:14.980 --> 15:18.484
We gonna have to figure
everything else out later.

15:18.550 --> 15:19.918
Brooke, we're ready
for you.

15:19.985 --> 15:22.621
{\an4}I'm gonna be
right out here.

15:19.985 --> 15:22.621
{\an3}Okay.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.457
Hold it down now.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.457
{\an3}Ohh.

{\an8}(Solo Lucci)
Yeah, that's right!

15:58.857 --> 16:00.359
{\an8}This is what an advance
from a record label

16:00.426 --> 16:01.860
{\an8}really supposed to look like.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.896
{\an8}If Solo Lucci got some money,

16:03.962 --> 16:05.831
{\an8}everybody gonna

16:05.898 --> 16:07.433
(laughter)

16:07.499 --> 16:09.501
How much you

16:09.568 --> 16:12.404
{\an1}(coughing)
About 20.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.474
20K?!
A night, bro?

16:15.541 --> 16:16.942
This ain't going nowhere.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.611
Can invest in something
and be even more lit.

16:19.678 --> 16:23.082
{\an1}Bro, you like the tenth
person that done told me that.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.018
Well, somebody need to make
some type of sense to you.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.120
This is fun.
It don't last.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.788
We'll worry about
that (bleep) then.

16:29.855 --> 16:31.790
{\an1}Until then, we gonna
keep turning up.

16:31.857 --> 16:34.993
{\an5}(A1)
I've seen so many times
in this game.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.029
{\an8}Someone gets
a little bit of money

16:37.096 --> 16:38.864
{\an8}and they just blow it all.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.265
Well, guess what?

16:40.332 --> 16:42.701
That money goes fast,
and L.A. ain't cheap.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.170
Baby, shake some!

16:45.237 --> 16:47.172
Hey... Hold on, bro.

16:47.239 --> 16:49.775
I'm seeing Lyrica
keep blowing me up, dawg.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.411
"You having funny
at your porno party?"

16:52.478 --> 16:54.646
What? Porno party?

16:54.713 --> 16:56.482
{\an1}Who the (bleep)
recording up in here?

16:56.548 --> 16:59.017
I don't know who's in here
sending pictures to Lyrica,

16:59.084 --> 17:01.920
but she has no leg to
stand on trying to check me

17:01.987 --> 17:03.756
after what me and her
are going through.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.324
Man, what you got
going on, though?

17:05.391 --> 17:06.759
{\an1}How-- That's enough
about me.

17:06.825 --> 17:08.193
Damn, bro, I've been
going through it.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.363
K. Michelle started
this rumor

17:11.430 --> 17:13.598
that Lyrica was trying
to sleep with Safaree.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.101
So I holler at Lyrica,

17:16.167 --> 17:18.002
and she just
spazzed out, like...

17:18.069 --> 17:19.338
She guilty.
She guilty.

17:19.405 --> 17:20.705
...bar, just knocking
her drink over.

17:20.772 --> 17:21.973
This is, like, affecting
the family, (bleep).

17:22.040 --> 17:25.544
Like, my mama and
Lyrica mama got into it.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.179
I'm into it
with my brother.

17:27.246 --> 17:28.881
He trying to
come down on me.

17:28.947 --> 17:30.249
And the crazy part
about it is

17:30.315 --> 17:33.018
{\an1}they kind of encouraging me
to get a divorce.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.153
You know what I'm saying?

17:34.219 --> 17:36.355
{\an7}Ugh!

17:34.219 --> 17:36.355
{\an8}Look who decided
to join us!

17:36.422 --> 17:38.490

17:38.557 --> 17:40.192
{\an7}Look, a thot-porn fest
is going on!

17:40.259 --> 17:41.960
{\an8}Any time Lucci
has a party,

17:42.027 --> 17:43.529
{\an8}you know it's
some type of orgy.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.831
{\an8}That's why I'm out here.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.831
{\an8}Just nasty in there!

17:45.898 --> 17:47.666
I haven't seen you
in so (bleep) long.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.067
She got boo-ed up
and left us.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.036
{\an5}Yeah, I'm boo-ed up.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.036
{\an1}Boo-ed up?

17:51.103 --> 17:53.705
That little cute thing
I be seeing you post?

17:53.772 --> 17:55.641
{\an6}Yes, yes.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.641
{\an1}Oh, he's a little
honey, girl.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.443
That's my baby.
I love him.

17:57.509 --> 17:58.744
{\an4}Aww!

17:57.509 --> 17:58.744
He's amazing.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.380
He's a good man.
He's helping me with my music.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.282
{\an4}Okay.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.282
We just shot a video.

18:03.348 --> 18:05.517
{\an4}Okay, see?

18:03.348 --> 18:05.517
He has a studio

18:05.584 --> 18:06.919

day in and day out.

18:06.985 --> 18:08.387
Go you got you

18:08.454 --> 18:10.722
Well, I got me

{\an5}Ahh!

18:30.476 --> 18:33.111
I know Paris through
a couple my friends,

18:33.178 --> 18:34.913
songwriters and producers
in the industry,

18:34.980 --> 18:37.416
so it's really dope
to link up with her.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.151
{\an5}Nice to meet you, too.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.151
I've heard so many
things about you.

18:39.218 --> 18:41.987
{\an1}And I watched you,

18:42.054 --> 18:44.389

so thank you so much.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.389
Oh, thank you.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.358
I just respect
women like her

18:46.425 --> 18:48.293

18:48.360 --> 18:51.196

by storm like her,

18:51.263 --> 18:53.098
so for me to meet her,
it was an honor.

18:53.165 --> 18:55.267
What is going on?
You in L.A.

18:55.334 --> 18:56.768
How's the music?

19:00.038 --> 19:01.240

That's right.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.242
{\an5}Okay?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.242

19:03.308 --> 19:05.043

19:05.110 --> 19:06.645
{\an5}Oh, yeah, that's A1.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.645
Oh, yeah, that's him.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.263

19:24.329 --> 19:26.398

{\an5}Hey, what's going on?

19:34.339 --> 19:36.008
Nice to meet you.

19:36.074 --> 19:37.543
{\an1}I work with one
of your partners.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.177
{\an4}He wrote
one of my biggest
songs, "How We Do".

19:39.244 --> 19:40.679
{\an3}Ohh.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.679
{\an1}And I--

19:40.746 --> 19:43.015
{\an1}So, I had to come
introduce myself to you.

19:43.081 --> 19:45.250
{\an1}I'm from Detroit.
I just moved here to L.A.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.119
She, like,
got the dance moves.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.487
Got the whole choreograph.

19:48.554 --> 19:51.056
Like, she take it serious,
like, the hard way.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.125
Well, damn, my brother
just vouched,

19:53.191 --> 19:54.526
{\an8}so you gotta
be crazy with it.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.295
{\an7}I do what I do.
You feel me?

19:56.361 --> 19:57.796
{\an8}(La'Britney laughing)

19:56.361 --> 19:57.796
{\an8}I hear you, I hear you.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.197
{\an7}But, no, I mean, I would
love to work with you.

19:59.264 --> 20:02.534
{\an4}Maybe we can link up
in the studio
or whatever works.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.337
{\an3}Yeah.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.105
I just know Lyrica,
and I just feel like

20:07.172 --> 20:09.107
she just wouldn't be
into that.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.276
{\an1}I don't think she gonna
too pressed if her--

20:11.343 --> 20:13.745
{\an1}If he working with
up and coming artists

20:13.812 --> 20:16.248
{\an1}that don't want him
like that-- Oh!

20:16.315 --> 20:18.417
{\an8}What you doing here!

20:19.952 --> 20:21.153
{\an8}What's going on?

20:21.219 --> 20:22.621
{\an8}This supposed to be
a Lucci exec party?

20:22.688 --> 20:23.956
{\an1}Ain't nothing exec
about this thot-fest.

20:24.022 --> 20:25.223
{\an5}Well, I didn't know.

20:24.022 --> 20:25.223
It's a hoochie party.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.259
{\an1}You told me it was a bunch
of execs and all this.

20:27.326 --> 20:28.760
{\an5}A red carpet type (bleep).

20:27.326 --> 20:28.760
And that's what I thought!

20:28.827 --> 20:31.330
{\an1}Yo, relax...
No, 'cause every time

20:31.396 --> 20:32.998
{\an1}you're in a situation
you're talking about Nikki.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.366
{\an4}"I'm going with Nikki."
This is the type of stuff
that goes on.

20:34.433 --> 20:35.867
{\an5}No, it's no!

20:34.433 --> 20:35.867
{\an1}Ohh!

20:35.934 --> 20:37.569
I'm not gonna take
the blame for nothing,

20:37.636 --> 20:38.737
'cause I didn't think that
you couldn't have friends.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.372
{\an6}I'm sorry.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.372
You said execs?

20:40.439 --> 20:41.873
{\an4}How she know execs?
You said she's
got execs here.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.709
What do you mean
how do I know execs?

20:43.775 --> 20:45.811
(overlapping shouting)

20:45.877 --> 20:47.145
{\an1}As an artist?
She's not an artist!

20:47.212 --> 20:49.481
{\an5}So what?

20:47.212 --> 20:49.481
She not a manager.

20:49.548 --> 20:50.949
{\an1}Do you know how many
artists come into the club?

20:51.016 --> 20:52.317
I'm not some
bum-ass bitch.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.486
You think it's okay to put
a friend in this situation?

20:54.553 --> 20:56.655
{\an5}I'm grown, Akbar.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.655
{\an1}It's not about you
being grown.

20:56.722 --> 20:57.689
{\an1}I don't want you
to relapse.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.958
I'm not!
Quit saying that!

21:00.025 --> 21:02.694
I get so pissed off when
Akbar brings up my drinking.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.230
He knows that
that's a sore subject for me.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.699
I've tried so hard to move on
from those issues,

21:07.766 --> 21:09.468
and I don't appreciate him
bringing it up.

21:09.534 --> 21:10.769
{\an1}When I met her,
she got out of rehab.

21:10.836 --> 21:12.604
I was there for her
when she was in rehab.

21:12.671 --> 21:13.772
Okay, so why are y'all
talking about me?

21:13.839 --> 21:15.073
She's been
on the right path.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.375
Stop (bleep) talking

36:19.610 --> 36:21.178
{\an5}Not really.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.178
I didn't come at you
in New York

36:21.245 --> 36:22.880
saying (bleep).
I sat there.

36:22.947 --> 36:24.415
{\an1}You did, though,
you did.

36:24.482 --> 36:26.817
We are in a relationship

36:26.884 --> 36:29.820
that I plan to continue
to work through.

36:29.887 --> 36:31.422
We're gonna stop
at this... 'cause this is...

36:31.489 --> 36:33.524
{\an1}Are you ready to go through
like all her lawsuits

36:33.591 --> 36:35.593
and the court issues
and (bleep) with her?

36:35.660 --> 36:38.095
{\an1}This is what I mean.
This is shady boots over here.

36:38.162 --> 36:39.797
{\an1}I never had a personal issue
with you.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.098
{\an4}'Kay.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.098
{\an3}Ever.

36:41.165 --> 36:43.000
You take to Twitter,
you take to Instagram.

36:43.067 --> 36:44.569
And that (bleep) make me
wanna catch a (bleep)

36:44.635 --> 36:45.970
catch a fade
right on sight.

36:46.037 --> 36:51.275
What kind of man chooses
to date a woman

36:51.342 --> 36:54.345
{\an8}who does nothing but threaten
the safety of

36:54.412 --> 36:55.880
the mother of your child?

36:55.947 --> 36:57.548
{\an1}You might wanna start
wearing your natural hair.

36:57.615 --> 36:59.450
{\an1}'Kay? Might wanna
take off your nails.

37:01.819 --> 37:03.888
Bitch, are you out of
your mother(bleep) mind?

37:03.955 --> 37:05.756
He's a repeat offender.

37:05.823 --> 37:07.558
And every bitch he gets with

37:07.625 --> 37:09.327
has been allowed
to disrespect me.

37:09.393 --> 37:12.964
{\an1}There's nothing final to say,
I'm over it.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.765
Dreux, you're no longer
welcome in my home.

37:14.832 --> 37:16.133
I don't trust you.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.736
{\an1}Ay, ay, ay, sit.
Sit down, sit down!

37:18.803 --> 37:20.538
{\an5}This (bleep) is wack!

37:18.803 --> 37:20.538
I'm done! I'm done!

37:20.605 --> 37:21.839
{\an5}It's not real.

37:20.605 --> 37:21.839
Then let it.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.141
When you see me, dawg,
it's a wrap for you.

37:24.208 --> 37:26.010
{\an1}Roll up!
Roll up!

37:27.478 --> 37:28.746
{\an8}(woman)
Coming up...

37:28.813 --> 37:30.881
{\an8}How many of your sex tapes
has your son seen, bitch?

37:30.948 --> 37:32.617
{\an8}Bring up my (bleep)
one more time.

37:32.683 --> 37:35.019
{\an8}Bring 'em up.
Bring 'em up.

37:32.683 --> 37:35.019
{\an5}How many times...?

37:42.360 --> 37:43.794
It's a wrap for you.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.630
{\an1}Roll up!
Roll up!

37:45.696 --> 37:48.833
I'm getting sick and tired
of Moniece's hostility.

37:48.899 --> 37:51.168
All you should be focused on
when it comes to me

37:51.235 --> 37:52.269
is our son.

37:52.336 --> 37:53.604
{\an1}(A.D.)
Yeah, let him in.

37:53.671 --> 37:55.373
This thing with me and Tiffany
is real, so...

37:55.439 --> 37:57.375
she gonna meet Kam
at some point.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.210
And Moniece is just gonna
have to get over it

37:59.276 --> 38:00.611
and accept it.

38:00.678 --> 38:02.713
Everyone that comes
into your life

38:02.780 --> 38:03.848
that you stick
your (bleep) in,

38:03.914 --> 38:05.616
you hang out with,
you spend time with,

38:05.683 --> 38:06.984
you go on a date with,

38:07.051 --> 38:09.854
feels like they can
disrespect me.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.555
And you wanna know
the truth?

38:11.622 --> 38:14.725
I'm in a really low
space right now,

38:14.792 --> 38:16.894
and that has a lot to do
with (bleep)

38:16.961 --> 38:19.230
that I've been
harboring about you.

38:19.296 --> 38:22.500
And it's eating me up

38:22.566 --> 38:24.435
because I want you
to have that.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.971
I want my son to have
somebody just as good

38:27.038 --> 38:29.507
or if not better than me
when I'm not there.

38:29.573 --> 38:31.509
{\an8}(sobbing)
I want that for my son.

38:31.575 --> 38:33.444
{\an8}I want-- the anger
isn't with her.

38:33.511 --> 38:35.312
{\an1}Because all that
you mentioning from the past...

38:35.379 --> 38:37.481
{\an5}I want you to have my back!

38:35.379 --> 38:37.481
I'm sorry about that.

38:37.548 --> 38:39.617
{\an5}I want you to have my back!

38:37.548 --> 38:39.617
I've had your back, Moniece.

38:39.684 --> 38:41.185
No, I don't feel
that you have.

38:41.252 --> 38:42.253
Come on, y'all.

38:42.319 --> 38:44.455
{\an1}I host a lot of--
a lot of beefs

38:44.522 --> 38:46.557
{\an1}and a lot of (bleep)
that comes my way

38:46.624 --> 38:47.992
{\an1}because of you,
yes, I do.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.494
This situation made me realize

38:50.561 --> 38:53.030
that Dreux has never
had my back.

38:53.097 --> 38:56.634
Dreux has never considered me,
never supported me.

38:56.701 --> 39:00.438
So for him to "date"...

39:00.504 --> 39:02.473
for lack of a better term,

39:02.540 --> 39:07.611
Tiffany is just
super (bleep) low.

39:07.678 --> 39:11.115
You know what? You guys,
good luck with that.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.484
If she's gonna be a part of
whatever you guys are doing,

39:13.551 --> 39:15.386
then count me
the (bleep) out.

39:15.453 --> 39:16.921
That's the bottom line.

39:16.987 --> 39:18.689
Bye.
Thanks for coming.

39:18.756 --> 39:20.291
Bitch, (bleep) my (bleep).

39:20.357 --> 39:21.559
{\an5}And the next time you see me--

39:20.357 --> 39:21.559
Go get a real Gucci bag...

39:21.625 --> 39:23.694
Next time you see me,
run up!

39:23.761 --> 39:25.029
Bitch, you know
where I--

39:25.096 --> 39:26.530
You know where I'm at
in L.A. all the time!

39:26.597 --> 39:28.699
Hey! Hey!

39:28.766 --> 39:30.768
How many of your sex tapes
has your son seen, bitch?

39:30.835 --> 39:32.002
Bye now! Bye now!

39:30.835 --> 39:32.002
{\an1}Right.

39:32.069 --> 39:33.637
{\an8}Bye now! Bye now!

39:33.704 --> 39:35.673
{\an8}Talk about my son
one more time.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.441
{\an5}(bleep) you.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.441
Bring up my son
one more time.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.810
{\an5}Bring him up.
Bring him up.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.810
How many times...

39:39.877 --> 39:41.579
{\an8}No, let me go.
No, let me go!

39:41.645 --> 39:43.581
{\an4}(Fizz)
Need to keep the kids
out of it, yo.

39:43.647 --> 39:44.849
Why you doing that?

39:44.915 --> 39:46.217
No, all she do
is bring up my son.

39:46.283 --> 39:48.119
Bitch, don't talk
about my son ever, slut!

39:48.185 --> 39:50.020
{\an6}Okay.

39:48.185 --> 39:50.020
{\an1}All right, bye,
you guys, thank you.

39:50.087 --> 39:53.157
{\an5}Can't even buy
a (bleep) bag, bitch.

39:50.087 --> 39:53.157
Bye, Dreux.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.126
Bye.

40:00.364 --> 40:02.366
{\an8}(woman)
Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

40:02.433 --> 40:05.469
{\an8}(Paris)
I digged up some stuff
on Mr. Akbar,

40:05.536 --> 40:08.506
{\an8}and the blogs they was saying
that he might be married.

40:08.572 --> 40:11.008
{\an7}Well, he's not married.
That's a lie.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.209
{\an8}That's some
corny-ass (bleep), though.

40:12.276 --> 40:14.111
{\an8}The girl's putting
his last name.

40:14.178 --> 40:16.814
{\an7}What?

40:16.881 --> 40:19.250
{\an7}People are really believing
that this is your wife,

40:19.316 --> 40:20.618
{\an8}and I'm looking crazy.

40:20.684 --> 40:21.986
{\an8}I ain't thinking about
no other woman.

40:22.052 --> 40:24.688
{\an8}I'm focused on you.
That's in my past.

40:24.755 --> 40:28.626
{\an8}That's in the past?

40:24.755 --> 40:28.626
{\an9}Yes.

40:28.692 --> 40:31.028
{\an8}It's kinda over already.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.763
{\an8}What's over?

40:31.095 --> 40:32.763
{\an8}You and Marcus.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.131
{\an8}That's a joke.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.131
{\an8}No, we're not over.

40:34.198 --> 40:37.201
{\an8}Did he tell you that
I might be pregnant?

40:37.268 --> 40:39.336
{\an7}Am I gonna be a sexy
stepmama or what?

40:39.403 --> 40:40.938
{\an8}I told you I was gonna
handle the situation.

40:41.005 --> 40:43.374
{\an7}Maybe you could use
a few of those.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.742
{\an8}(bleep) move, Marcus!

40:44.809 --> 40:46.644
{\an8}Like, I'm tired of her
popping the (bleep) up.

40:46.710 --> 40:49.180
{\an8}Listen.

40:46.710 --> 40:49.180
{\an7}Break up with him before
he break up with you!

40:49.246 --> 40:52.183
{\an8}Advice, it's just advice.

40:49.246 --> 40:52.183
{\an8}Do you have to?

40:52.249 --> 40:55.186
{\an7}You know, La'Britney, she was
doing the Lyrica joint!

40:55.252 --> 40:56.687
{\an9}Oh, whoa!

40:55.252 --> 40:56.687
{\an8}And that (bleep)...

40:56.754 --> 40:58.455
{\an8}Looks like he's
living his best life.

40:58.522 --> 40:59.723
{\an8}No, he's living his life.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.358
{\an8}Why you all mad?

40:59.790 --> 41:01.358
{\an8}Why you so rude, bitch?

41:01.425 --> 41:03.360
{\an7}Why you so mad?
"You at my husband's show."

41:03.427 --> 41:05.095
{\an9}You saw--

41:03.427 --> 41:05.095
{\an8}That's my husband, ho!

41:05.162 --> 41:06.497
{\an8}I don't give a (bleep)
who he is, bitch!

41:06.564 --> 41:09.533
{\an7}I'm gonna go, because once
again, it's always something.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.168
{\an7}Look, first of all,
we gonna talk.

41:11.235 --> 41:13.904
{\an7}but this ain't the time--
What are you looking at, bro?

41:13.971 --> 41:15.272
{\an8}Now what you taking
your jacket off for?

41:15.339 --> 41:16.907
{\an8}I need to take it off
in case you get stupid.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.642
{\an7}What's up?

41:16.974 --> 41:18.642
{\an8}What you trying?

41:18.709 --> 41:20.177
{\an7}What's up?

41:18.709 --> 41:20.177
{\an8}(overlapping shouting)
