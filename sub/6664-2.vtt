00:00.800 --> 00:02.434
Adult adam:
<i> The school play...</i>

00:02.436 --> 00:03.335
<i> That time-honored tradition</i>

00:03.337 --> 00:05.571
<i> Where a young,</i>
<i> budding performer</i>
<i> can walk the boards</i>

00:05.573 --> 00:08.674
<i> And feel</i>
<i> the hot spotlight</i>
<i> on their face.</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:10.142
<i> Sure, the sets</i>
<i> were flimsy</i>

00:10.144 --> 00:10.843
<i> And the costumes cheap,</i>

00:10.845 --> 00:13.012
<i> But to us,</i>
<i> it might as well</i>
<i> have been broadway.</i>

00:13.014 --> 00:16.782
<i> And I wanted nothing more</i>
<i> than to be a part of it.</i>

00:16.784 --> 00:18.517
<i> Jesus christ superstar!</i>

00:18.519 --> 00:23.122
(gasps) the school
is literally doing
my favorite musical!

00:23.124 --> 00:24.056
It's fate!

00:24.058 --> 00:26.325
You're gonna become
a musical-theater actor!

00:26.327 --> 00:28.827
That's every mother's
dream for her son!

00:28.829 --> 00:30.562
This is perfect.
I know every part.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.432
The question is,
which one do I
audition for?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.934
There is only
one role suitable

00:35.936 --> 00:39.204
For my talented,
delicious little boy.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.840
My baby...Is jesus.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.642
Mmm. Yeah, that's
a pretty demanding part.

00:43.644 --> 00:47.312
Maybe adam would be
more comfortable
playing something like...

00:47.314 --> 00:47.980
Get...

00:47.982 --> 00:49.448
Get out of here!
Hey!

00:49.450 --> 00:53.052
Filling his head
with doubt
and stupid ideas!

00:53.054 --> 00:54.319
I don't know, mom.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.789
It... It really is
a tough part,

00:56.791 --> 00:58.157
And I'm always
in the chorus.

00:58.159 --> 01:02.194
Boopie, I've heard you
sing in the shower,
mm-kay?

01:02.196 --> 01:03.529
Not just heard...

01:03.531 --> 01:04.463
Listened.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.898
Not just listened...

01:05.900 --> 01:06.565
Taped.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.866
And sent to <i> star search.</i>

01:07.868 --> 01:10.669
I got to call them back.
I haven't heard
from ed mcmahon.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.905
I'll just drop him a line,
see what's up.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.073
My baby is a star!

01:14.075 --> 01:16.108
Adult adam:
<i> Who was I to argue</i>
<i> with beverly goldberg?</i>

01:16.110 --> 01:20.913
<i> I took her advice</i>
<i> and auditioned</i>
<i> for the big j.</i>

01:22.115 --> 01:23.916
<i> ¶ try not to get worried</i>

01:23.918 --> 01:25.717
<i> ¶ try not to turn on to...</i>

01:25.719 --> 01:27.986
<i> ¶ problems that upset you...</i>

01:27.988 --> 01:30.289
<i> ¶ oh, don't you know...</i>

01:30.291 --> 01:31.824
<i> ¶ everything's all right</i>

01:31.826 --> 01:33.225
<i> ¶ yes, everything's fine</i>

01:33.227 --> 01:36.929
<i> ¶ we want you</i>
<i> to sleep well tonight ¶</i>

01:37.764 --> 01:38.730
Can I start over, please?

01:38.732 --> 01:40.132
<i> ¶ and if you try,</i>
<i> we'll get...</i>

01:40.134 --> 01:43.135
<i> ¶ by...</i>
<i> So forget all about us...</i>

01:43.137 --> 01:43.802
<i> ¶ tonight</i>

01:43.804 --> 01:45.304
<i> ¶ yes, everything's</i>
<i> all right</i>

01:45.306 --> 01:49.141
<i> ¶ yes, everything's</i>
<i> all right, yes ¶</i>

01:49.342 --> 01:50.809
Well done,
mr. Goldberg.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.611
You've really improved
since last year.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.379
(dramatic music)

01:56.616 --> 01:59.284
Oh, god.
The cast list is up.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.386
Relax.
You always get the lead.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.221
Man, how are you so calm?

02:02.223 --> 02:05.891
Eh, miss cinoman kind of
implied that I blew her mind,
whatever.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.359
All I know is,
there's a good chance

02:07.361 --> 02:10.596
That I'm gonna be the jesus
to your mary.

02:10.763 --> 02:13.665
Adult adam:
<i> It was that classic moment</i>
<i> we've all been through,</i>

02:13.667 --> 02:15.100
<i> Whether it was for sports</i>
<i> or theater.</i>

02:15.102 --> 02:19.404
<i> We've all stood</i>
<i> in front of a list</i>
<i> to find out,</i>

02:19.406 --> 02:20.606
<i> "did I make the cut?"</i>

02:20.608 --> 02:22.541
(gasps) you were right!
I'm mary magdalene!

02:22.543 --> 02:23.909
Adult adam:
<i> I was praying</i>
<i> my name would be</i>

02:23.911 --> 02:27.045
<i> Somewhere at the top</i>
<i> of the list.</i>

02:27.280 --> 02:28.614
<i> Oh, god, no!</i>

02:28.616 --> 02:30.649
<i> Not the dreaded second page!</i>

02:30.651 --> 02:34.386
Yes, I'm jesus!
Son of god, baby!

02:34.388 --> 02:35.420
Oh, that's great.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.923
Um, who did you get,
adam?

02:38.091 --> 02:41.093
Uh, I...
I'll be right back.

02:41.561 --> 02:42.861
Adam: Miss cinoman!

02:42.863 --> 02:45.430
I... I think there's been
some kind of mistake

02:45.432 --> 02:47.733
Because I'm pretty familiar
with the musical,

02:47.735 --> 02:49.568
And there is no
todd the apostle.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.437
Oh, there's no
darnell the apostle, either.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.639
But there was such
a large turnout,

02:53.641 --> 02:56.308
I took the liberty
of expanding
jesus' followers

02:56.310 --> 02:57.009
From 12 to 30.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.278
30? You can't fit
that many people
at the last supper.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.881
Oh, yeah, there's gonna be
another smaller table,
off to the side.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.083
I'm at the kids' table
at the last supper?

03:05.085 --> 03:07.953
I'm sorry.
There was a lot
of competition this year.

03:07.955 --> 03:12.491
Remember, there are
no small parts,
only small actors.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.026
But there are small parts!

03:14.028 --> 03:15.561
Very small! Like todd!

03:15.563 --> 03:18.530
Do not let your heart
be troubled, my child.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.465
Trust...In me.

03:20.733 --> 03:21.833
This putz?

03:21.835 --> 03:24.102
You made this putz jesus?

03:24.104 --> 03:24.503
Unreal!

03:24.505 --> 03:27.706
Adult adam:
<i> Yep, I was once again</i>
<i> shoved into the background.</i>

03:27.708 --> 03:30.642
<i> It was the biggest heartbreak</i>
<i> of my young life.</i>

03:30.644 --> 03:32.277
<i> ¶ everything's all right, yes</i>

03:32.279 --> 03:34.079
<i> ¶ everything's fine ¶</i>
beverly: Boopie?

03:34.081 --> 03:37.683
(sniffles)
I've been calling.
Meatloaf's ready.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.518
Are you crying?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.819
No.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.653
Who hurt you?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.989
Tell me and I will
hurt them tenfold.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.157
(sobbing)

03:45.159 --> 03:46.725
I didn't get jesus!

03:46.727 --> 03:47.726
I'm a random apostle,

03:47.728 --> 03:51.697
And I'm so sad
'cause I'm not good enough!

03:52.298 --> 03:53.632
I'm gonna ask you
a question

03:53.634 --> 03:57.102
That you need to answer
with complete honesty.

03:57.537 --> 04:01.273
Is there a world
in which you are not

04:01.275 --> 04:05.177
The most deserving child
for this role?

04:05.378 --> 04:06.678
There is
no such world.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.114
Honey,
I can get involved.

04:09.116 --> 04:12.751
I want to get involved.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.953
But I need to know
that's what you want.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.055
Adult adam:
<i> Usually, when my mother</i>
<i> wanted to mix in,</i>

04:17.057 --> 04:18.957
<i> I'd push her away</i>
<i> as far as possible.</i>

04:18.959 --> 04:21.593
<i> This was not one</i>
<i> of those times.</i>

04:21.595 --> 04:24.730
Do it, mama.
Make me jesus.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.665
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

04:26.667 --> 04:31.970
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

04:32.939 --> 04:34.039
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

04:34.041 --> 04:37.209
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

04:37.211 --> 04:38.277
(car horns honking)
ah! Come on!

04:38.279 --> 04:40.045
Adult adam:
<i> It was December 8th,</i>
<i> 1980-something...</i>

04:40.047 --> 04:42.447
(screaming)
<i> ...And my dad was</i>
<i> driving home from work.</i>

04:42.449 --> 04:43.582
<i> And battling</i>
<i> his mortal enemy...</i>

04:43.584 --> 04:45.784
Green light, people!
<i> ...Traffic.</i>

04:45.786 --> 04:47.886
Green light!
Why aren't you moving?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.755
Son of a...
(screaming)

04:49.757 --> 04:51.290
You're letting him in?

04:51.292 --> 04:52.524
He's part of a funeral!

04:52.526 --> 04:53.725
That could be
a hundred cars!

04:53.727 --> 04:57.796
What kind of crossing guard
crosses one kid at a time?

04:57.798 --> 04:58.597
(guard blowing whistle)

04:58.599 --> 04:59.965
You got to group 'em
and herd 'em!

04:59.967 --> 05:03.602
Adult adam: <i> Traffic even came</i>
<i> before his favorite thing</i>
<i> in the world...</i>

05:03.604 --> 05:05.003
<i> Hockey.</i>
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

05:05.005 --> 05:06.638
Best game
I've ever been to.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.406
Best game hands down.

05:07.408 --> 05:10.876
Crowd: (chanting)
let's go, flyers, let's go!

05:10.878 --> 05:14.179
Let's go, flyers,
let's go!

05:14.181 --> 05:15.514
Let's go, flyers...

05:15.516 --> 05:16.381
Let's go.
What?

05:16.383 --> 05:19.117
There's 10 minutes left!
It's a tie game.
We got to stay!

05:19.119 --> 05:19.885
Uh-uh. When the game ends,

05:19.887 --> 05:21.186
We'll be stuck in
the parking lot for six hours!

05:21.188 --> 05:22.788
Let's go!
Adult adam:
<i> That's right.</i>

05:22.790 --> 05:26.358
<i> No one in our family</i>
<i> had ever seen the end of</i>
<i> a game, concert, or show...</i>

05:26.360 --> 05:27.559
Will you just move
your leg?

05:27.561 --> 05:29.661
Adult adam:
<i> Not when my father</i>
<i> had traffic to beat.</i>

05:29.663 --> 05:32.230
29 minutes,
door-to-door!

05:32.232 --> 05:34.066
A brand-new record!

05:34.068 --> 05:35.967
My god, am I jealous
of you two!

05:35.969 --> 05:39.571
Ron hextall
scores the final goal!

05:39.573 --> 05:40.806
Who would've figured that?

05:40.808 --> 05:44.109
Hextall?
No, he's the goalie.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.344
Goalies can't score.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.078
That's what I thought!

05:46.080 --> 05:48.613
The first time
in nhl history,

05:48.615 --> 05:50.515
And you guys
were there!

05:50.517 --> 05:52.184
He's wrong.
Goalies can't score.

05:52.186 --> 05:56.054
Man: <i> And that's the replay</i>
<i> of the greatest goal</i>
<i> in hockey history.</i>

05:56.056 --> 05:58.957
<i> It's one of those moments</i>
<i> that makes you feel</i>
<i> lucky to be alive.</i>

05:58.959 --> 06:00.826
Huh. Goalies can score.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.027
You!

06:02.029 --> 06:03.462
Really? You're gonna make
a thing out of this?

06:03.464 --> 06:06.098
You made me miss
the greatest moment
of my life!

06:06.100 --> 06:10.302
And for what? Traffic?
It isn't that bad!

06:10.304 --> 06:11.436
Stop right there!

06:11.438 --> 06:13.271
You should be
thanking me.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.606
Thanking you?
For what?

06:14.608 --> 06:17.042
You don't know the traffic
that I've seen!

06:17.044 --> 06:19.911
Miles of cars
lined up for hours,

06:19.913 --> 06:21.012
Horns blaring!

06:21.014 --> 06:22.247
I know what traffic is!

06:22.249 --> 06:24.216
Grown men
with their shirts off

06:24.218 --> 06:26.985
Walking around
'cause it's so damn hot!

06:26.987 --> 06:29.588
An ac's not meant
to run that long.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.489
It's not!

06:30.491 --> 06:31.923
It's hockey season!

06:31.925 --> 06:32.491
It's cold outside!

06:32.493 --> 06:34.793
No one gets shirtless!
You want
to know something?

06:34.795 --> 06:35.527
If I could,

06:35.529 --> 06:38.897
I'd go back in time
and do it all over again.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.732
As a matter of fact,
I'd leave earlier!

06:40.734 --> 06:43.168
That's what you'd do
with a time machine?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.604
You'd go back
and miss traffic?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.472
You wouldn't help people?

06:47.474 --> 06:48.907
Save president lincoln?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.008
Oh, I'd help abe!

06:50.010 --> 06:50.709
I'd go to the theater,

06:50.711 --> 06:53.111
I'd say, "hey, man,
you ought to leave
early tonight.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.714
"traffic's horrible!
Trust me!"

06:55.716 --> 06:57.115
Boom! Just saved his life!

06:57.117 --> 06:59.518
Adult adam: <i> While my dad</i>
<i> was sticking to his guns,</i>

06:59.520 --> 07:03.121
<i> My mom was in</i>
<i> the principal's office</i>
<i> with hers blazing.</i>

07:03.123 --> 07:04.589
She stormed
into my drama class,

07:04.591 --> 07:06.258
Ranting at me
like a crazy person.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.462
We had to do
a 45-minute massage train
just to calm me down.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.263
Well, that's on you.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.697
I mean, you wouldn't
know a good jesus

07:12.699 --> 07:14.833
If he walked right in here
and punched you in the face.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.435
Ball: Okay.

07:16.602 --> 07:20.372
I'm glad to see that
we're all calm now.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.841
Some...Ugly things
were said.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.009
(scoffs)

07:24.011 --> 07:25.010
And done.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.411
Mostly by mrs. Goldberg.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.212
Look, I am sorry.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.682
Adam is very enthusiastic,
and he works so hard.

07:30.684 --> 07:34.486
He's just not as skilled
as like, say, dave kim.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.822
If I may,
I just have one question.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.957
Are you (bleep)
kidding me?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.158
Whoa, whoa!
Cinoman: Hey!

07:40.160 --> 07:42.227
Out of line!
Ball: Mrs. Goldberg.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.895
Mrs. Goldberg,
this is a school.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.363
We can't speak like that.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.264
Well, hear this.

07:46.266 --> 07:51.336
My son will be starring
in his own school musical.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.437
His what?

07:52.439 --> 07:53.438
What does that even mean?

07:53.440 --> 07:54.706
(mockingly)
"what does that
even mean?"

07:54.708 --> 07:55.774
That's how you sound.
(exclaims)

07:55.776 --> 07:59.411
It means adam will be
putting on a rival play.

07:59.413 --> 08:02.214
Yeah, well...
Well, here's the thing.

08:02.216 --> 08:03.748
This is
junior-high theater,

08:03.750 --> 08:06.084
And we have a budget
for one play,

08:06.086 --> 08:08.420
And even that's a struggle
to fill seats.

08:08.422 --> 08:09.821
Tell me something, earl.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.157
Uh, how's your wife?

08:13.893 --> 08:15.160
She's fine.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.261
Lovely woman.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.329
Pam, is it?

08:17.331 --> 08:19.798
Remind me again
how you two got together.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.400
Well, you knew her
from jazzercise class.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.769
You introduced us.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.137
Did I, now?

08:26.139 --> 08:26.872
Oh.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.106
And how was the wedding?

08:28.108 --> 08:28.840
You were at the wedding.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.943
You made a speech,
even though nobody
asked you to.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.278
Well, from what
I remember,

08:33.280 --> 08:34.379
That was the night
you said,

08:34.381 --> 08:36.214
"how can I
ever repay you?"

08:36.216 --> 08:39.851
And I said, "one day,
I will come to you,

08:39.853 --> 08:41.186
"and I will ask you
for a favor."

08:41.188 --> 08:45.423
And you said,
"but of course, beverly.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.425
"but of course."

08:48.027 --> 08:50.362
That day is today.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.397
What's going on?

08:52.399 --> 08:55.700
Adam is starring
in a rival play.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.539
I'm home!

09:00.541 --> 09:01.206
Come on, murray!

09:01.208 --> 09:04.442
A very special
<i> love boat</i> is almost on!

09:04.444 --> 09:07.112
They're docking
at <i> fantasy island!</i>

09:07.114 --> 09:08.013
They're crossing over!

09:08.015 --> 09:10.215
Oh, my god!
That's unprecedented!

09:10.217 --> 09:12.484
(panting)
all right.

09:12.486 --> 09:13.985
Gimme the remote.

09:13.987 --> 09:14.719
What? I thought you had it.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.321
I just came in the door!
Why would I have a remote?

09:16.323 --> 09:18.523
I... I don't know.
I figured you took it
to work.

09:18.525 --> 09:19.958
Why would I take
the remote to work?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.394
Who the hell knows?
You're a quirky guy.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.730
Fine. I'll use my hand
like an animal.

09:26.899 --> 09:27.599
Where's the knob?

09:27.601 --> 09:30.268
Do you mean
this knob?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.236
I'm so sorry.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.505
Are you missing
something historical?

09:33.507 --> 09:34.906
Perhaps a crossover event

09:34.908 --> 09:37.008
Of your two favorite shows
that you'll never see,

09:37.010 --> 09:39.044
And it will haunt you
for the rest of your life?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.445
Gimme the knob.
No.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.179
Gimme the knob!
No. No.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.014
Gimme the knob!
Gimme the knob!
No. No.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.416
(shouting) gimme the knob!

09:44.418 --> 09:45.083
No. No. No.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.651
You took something
I love.

09:46.653 --> 09:47.819
Now I'm taking something
you love.

09:47.821 --> 09:51.389
Well, what about me?
I'm just an innocent
bystander!

09:51.391 --> 09:53.425
Sorry, pops.
Wrong place, wrong time.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.627
But I got to see
this show.

09:55.629 --> 09:59.197
Tattoo and gopher
in the same room.

09:59.199 --> 09:59.831
How's that gonna end?

09:59.833 --> 10:02.667
You are grounded, moron.
Six months!

10:02.669 --> 10:05.103
Fine! I'm never
going to a hockey game
with you again.

10:05.105 --> 10:09.040
But you...
You can't do that.
Hockey's our thing.

10:09.042 --> 10:09.908
Not anymore.

10:09.910 --> 10:10.642
Gimme the knob.
No.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.444
Gimme the knob.
Gimme the knob.
No. No. No.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.646
(shouting)
gimme the knob!
Fine!

10:15.114 --> 10:16.314
Adult adam: <i> So, my dad</i>
<i> finally got the remote,</i>

10:16.316 --> 10:20.151
<i> But he lost</i>
<i> his favorite thing</i>
<i> to do with his son.</i>

10:20.153 --> 10:22.454
<i> Forever.</i>
(television clicks)

10:23.122 --> 10:24.923
Adam: I can't believe
I'm doing a rival play!

10:24.925 --> 10:27.392
Now the question is,
what's our show?

10:27.394 --> 10:28.660
(stammering)
it's got to be big.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.361
Bigger than jesus.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.029
<i> Music man?</i>
(scoffs) yawn.

10:31.031 --> 10:31.930
<i> Guys and dolls?</i>
Seen it.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.532
<i> Phantom?</i>
You want to cover
half of this face?

10:34.534 --> 10:35.900
Wait!
What?

10:35.902 --> 10:37.502
It's so obvious.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.637
Who wants to waste
their evening

10:38.639 --> 10:41.840
Sitting through
a silly musical
about bible times

10:41.842 --> 10:44.109
When they can go
to the future?

10:44.111 --> 10:44.643
The future.

10:44.645 --> 10:48.513
Our musical is going
to be an experience
of sight and sound

10:48.515 --> 10:51.916
With actors
not in common shoes,

10:51.918 --> 10:53.351
But roller skates,

10:53.353 --> 10:55.787
A story not about people,

10:55.789 --> 10:57.889
Something bigger.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.424
Trains.
Trains.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.393
<i> Starlight express!</i>

11:01.395 --> 11:02.293
(gasps)

11:02.295 --> 11:02.994
(screaming)

11:02.996 --> 11:04.996
(stammering)
look at my arm!
Ooh.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.631
Goosebumps.
Ooh!

11:06.633 --> 11:07.165
(both laughing)

11:07.167 --> 11:09.534
All right!
Well, all we need
is a cast.

11:09.536 --> 11:13.238
Actually, I know a mighty
talented girl named dana

11:13.240 --> 11:16.241
Who'd follow me
to the ends of the earth.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.109
Uh, no.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.210
We need to keep looking.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.612
Well, we don't have
a lot of options

11:20.614 --> 11:22.981
When it comes
to leading ladies.

11:22.983 --> 11:26.051
I suppose I could maybe
be the one to...

11:26.053 --> 11:27.052
You cannot.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.054
This is a show
for children.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.622
Got it.

11:30.624 --> 11:33.358
(sighs)
well, if it can't be me...

11:33.360 --> 11:36.294
And I think
we've ruled that out.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.029
We have.
Right.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.466
How about
the closest thing to me?

11:42.601 --> 11:43.601
(screams)

11:43.603 --> 11:44.636
Hello, daughter.
Have a seat.

11:44.638 --> 11:49.107
I just happened
to be digging around
in your closet,

11:49.109 --> 11:50.909
And guess what I found.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.210
Three beers,

11:52.212 --> 11:53.078
A fake id,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.145
And sick notes
for school

11:54.147 --> 11:56.114
That I don't remember
writing.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.718
There is
a simple explanation
for all of that.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.120
I just need half an hour
to collect my thoughts.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.823
Perhaps there's a world
where I could overlook
all this.

12:04.825 --> 12:08.326
Really?
I can give you a pass
this time.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.461
Just know
that one day,

12:09.463 --> 12:12.931
I will come to you
and ask you for a favor.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.599
Yeah, great.
That's totally fair.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.201
And that day
is right now.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.903
Adult adam: <i> While my mom</i>
<i> was forcing erica</i>
<i> to do the musical,</i>

12:18.905 --> 12:23.341
<i> My dad had forced pops</i>
<i> to replace barry.</i>

12:23.676 --> 12:25.677
You're crowding me.
Come on, man.

12:25.679 --> 12:28.179
Your... Your jacket's
puffing into my side.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.548
So what?
It's cold as hell in here.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.785
You think you can get them
to turn the heat on?

12:33.787 --> 12:37.088
No! There's a huge
block of ice out there!

12:37.090 --> 12:40.358
Ugh! What's that
terrible smell?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.025
What are you eating?

12:41.027 --> 12:43.862
I made myself
a whitefish-salad sandwich.

12:43.864 --> 12:44.996
Well, it's wafting!

12:44.998 --> 12:47.365
Barry and I get hot dogs
because they don't waft!

12:47.367 --> 12:51.136
You know, I don't think
this is about the whitefish

12:51.138 --> 12:52.704
Or this giant thermos

12:52.706 --> 12:54.539
Of borscht
I'm about to open.

12:54.541 --> 12:58.343
I think
this is about barry.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.144
Oh, please. It is not.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.247
It's obvious you want
to be here with him.

13:02.249 --> 13:02.781
(sighs)

13:02.783 --> 13:06.384
Well, I... I do
miss the moron a little.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.385
Hockey was our thing.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.622
Then just sit
in traffic already.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.956
It's that simple.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.691
Traffic is non-negotiable.

13:13.693 --> 13:17.195
Murray, sometimes
you have to do things
you hate

13:17.197 --> 13:20.131
For the people
that you love.
I know.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.934
Like how I'm here
with you now.

13:24.136 --> 13:27.772
Adult adam:
<i> As much as my dad hated</i>
<i> the sweet stink of borscht...</i>

13:27.774 --> 13:28.506
Oh! Oh, that smell.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.976
<i> He was still too stubborn</i>
<i> to give in.</i>

13:33.112 --> 13:34.579
Welcome to
the first rehearsal

13:34.581 --> 13:36.714
Of the disco-pop
masterpiece

13:36.716 --> 13:37.982
<i> Starlight express.</i>

13:37.984 --> 13:40.618
(chuckles)
as you know,
I'm adam goldberg,

13:40.620 --> 13:43.321
Your director
and leading man.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.222
And now please welcome

13:44.224 --> 13:48.059
My choreographer/
assistant/mom,

13:48.061 --> 13:50.295
Beverly goldberg.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.629
Hmm.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.532
Now, I need you all
to pay real close attention,

13:54.534 --> 13:56.701
'cause I only want
to do this once, okay?

13:56.703 --> 13:58.169
It's like
I want to scream and run,

13:58.171 --> 14:00.438
But I also want to see
what happens next.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.407
Beverly: Five, six,
seven, eight!

14:02.409 --> 14:04.142
<i> Starlight express!</i>

14:04.144 --> 14:05.443
<i> Starlight express!</i>

14:05.445 --> 14:08.680
The name of the show
is <i> starlight express.</i>

14:08.682 --> 14:09.881
Smoking car.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.049
Smoking car.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.116
Dining car!

14:12.118 --> 14:13.218
Dining car!

14:13.220 --> 14:14.285
Sleeping car.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.019
Sleeping car.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.454
I think I can!
I think I can!

14:16.456 --> 14:18.156
I think I can! Smile!

14:18.158 --> 14:19.858
(vocalizing)

14:19.860 --> 14:22.927
There's a hobo
on the train.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.496
(scattered applause)

14:25.931 --> 14:27.966
What fun.
Thank you.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.802
(sighs) all right.
Everybody got it?

14:30.804 --> 14:31.603
Let's see it!

14:31.605 --> 14:33.738
Five, six,
seven, eight!

14:33.740 --> 14:35.874
<i> Starlight express!</i>

14:35.876 --> 14:37.508
<i> Starlight express!</i>

14:37.510 --> 14:39.644
Ah, I like how some of you
are going forwards

14:39.646 --> 14:42.714
And some of you
are going sideways.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.382
Train hands.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.151
<i> Starlight express!</i>

14:47.419 --> 14:48.953
<i> Starlight express.</i>

14:48.955 --> 14:53.524
Wow. You seriously think
this is worth it?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.094
Thank you for
this wonderful gift, mama.

14:56.096 --> 15:01.165
Adult adam:
<i> Sure, it was a train wreck,</i>
<i> but she had my undying love.</i>

15:01.167 --> 15:03.668
It's totally worth it.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.605
Adult adam:
<i> The opening night</i>
<i> of</i> starlight express

15:07.607 --> 15:09.073
<i> Was quickly approaching,</i>

15:09.075 --> 15:10.041
<i> And I was melting down</i>

15:10.043 --> 15:12.277
<i> 'cause our show</i>
<i> was going off the rails.</i>

15:12.279 --> 15:15.513
Beverly: Three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

15:15.515 --> 15:17.815
Join on! Get there!

15:17.817 --> 15:18.850
Get there!

15:18.852 --> 15:20.952
What?
(grunts)

15:23.889 --> 15:25.123
Are you kidding me
right now?

15:25.125 --> 15:28.960
You're going too fast,
and I couldn't hook in.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.061
And I'm fine. Thanks.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.263
Uh, I...
I think we need
to take five.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.166
Do you think <i> superstar</i>
is taking five?

15:35.168 --> 15:36.401
No! They sold out!

15:36.403 --> 15:39.003
And how many tickets
have we sold, tyler?

15:39.005 --> 15:39.671
Seven.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.140
Seven tickets!
And do you know why?

15:42.142 --> 15:46.511
It's because some of you,
who shall remain nameless,

15:46.513 --> 15:47.478
Have no talent.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.481
Sanjeev, darlene, ethel,
skinny david, other david.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.282
You know what, adam?

15:51.284 --> 15:54.152
I'm not taking five.
I'm quitting.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.356
Fine! Quit!
We don't need you!

15:58.524 --> 15:59.490
(groans) aw, wait!

15:59.492 --> 16:02.293
She's the caboose!
Mom, stop her!

16:02.695 --> 16:03.928
Hey.

16:03.930 --> 16:04.595
'sup?

16:04.597 --> 16:05.563
I haven't seen you
in a while.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.566
I know you've
been super busy,
but I miss you.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.002
Maybe later
we could grab a bite?

16:11.737 --> 16:13.237
Who sent you?
What?

16:13.239 --> 16:13.905
Was it miss cinoman?

16:13.907 --> 16:16.074
'cause this has
her cinoman-y stink
all over it.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.842
I'm not
spying on you, adam.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.744
That's exactly
what a spy would say.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.347
Oh, whatever.
I'm gonna go.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.882
Honey, you need
to go apologize.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.150
I have to apologize?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.619
Have you seen
your choreography?

16:28.887 --> 16:29.787
Back to one, people!

16:29.789 --> 16:31.723
Adult adam:
<i> In that moment,</i>
<i> my mom realized</i>

16:31.725 --> 16:33.958
<i> She didn't make</i>
<i> her little boy a star.</i>

16:33.960 --> 16:35.393
<i> She made him a monster.</i>

16:35.395 --> 16:38.463
<i> Meanwhile, my dad</i>
<i> was still being</i>
<i> monstrously stubborn.</i>

16:38.465 --> 16:42.066
<i> Out of options, he brought</i>
<i> his favorite employee, vic,</i>

16:42.068 --> 16:43.234
<i> To the next game.</i>

16:43.236 --> 16:45.103
Whoa.
Right on the glass.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.604
Best seats
for my best pal.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.039
Hey, not bad.
Thank you.

16:48.041 --> 16:52.210
Announcer: <i> Please stand</i>
<i> for the canadian</i>
<i> national anthem.</i>

16:52.212 --> 16:56.581
<i> ¶ o canada</i>

16:56.583 --> 17:01.285
<i> ¶ my home</i>
<i> and native land... ¶</i>

17:01.287 --> 17:02.020
What are you doing?

17:02.022 --> 17:06.090
I'm singing the song
of my country.
What country?

17:06.092 --> 17:06.557
Canada.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.394
I'm from edmonton.
I've told you...

17:09.396 --> 17:10.294
Oh, forget it.

17:10.296 --> 17:14.532
(off-key)
<i> ¶ o canada</i>

17:14.900 --> 17:17.001
<i> ¶ we stand on guard</i>

17:17.003 --> 17:18.536
(crowd boos)

17:18.538 --> 17:19.270
<i> ¶ for thee ¶</i>

17:19.272 --> 17:20.972
Adult adam:
<i> As 10,000 people</i>
<i> booed my father,</i>

17:20.974 --> 17:24.008
<i> He officially realized</i>
<i> how much he missed barry.</i>

17:24.010 --> 17:25.676
(crowd jeering)
what are you doing?

17:25.678 --> 17:28.079
Adult adam:
<i> Back at home,</i>
<i> my mom missed the days</i>

17:28.081 --> 17:31.983
<i> When I was happy just to be</i>
<i> a schmo in the chorus.</i>

17:31.985 --> 17:33.885
Sorry I quit the play.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.087
But in my defense...

17:36.089 --> 17:38.122
It's a turd on wheels.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.123
Oh, it really is.

17:39.125 --> 17:42.860
How did my sweet, little boy
turn into such a monster?

17:42.862 --> 17:46.531
You shifted the world
so it entirely revolves
around him.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.232
Of course!
It's what I do!

17:48.234 --> 17:51.569
But usually
someone steps in
and stops me.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.838
Look, I know adam's
your little superstar,

17:53.840 --> 17:56.841
But there's a reason
he's always in the chorus.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.042
Well, I can't
tell him that.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.478
It would shatter
his precious heart.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.512
Aw.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.648
Lucky for you, I can.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.017
(spray can hisses)

18:06.919 --> 18:07.685
Hey, buddy.

18:07.687 --> 18:11.589
Mom needs to tell you
something about the show.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.493
She thinks it sucks.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.327
What?

18:16.329 --> 18:17.128
Don't get her wrong,

18:17.130 --> 18:19.130
She thinks you're
the most talented,
delicious boy

18:19.132 --> 18:22.700
In the whole world,
who deserves
to be the star.

18:23.235 --> 18:25.670
But no one else does.

18:26.705 --> 18:27.371
Mom?

18:27.373 --> 18:28.973
(stammering)
is this true?

18:28.975 --> 18:31.175
Honey, I, uh...

18:31.177 --> 18:34.278
I think we both got
a little bit carried away.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.746
Maybe a little.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.648
I know how much
you want this,

18:37.650 --> 18:40.718
And I want this for you.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.154
But sometimes...

18:43.156 --> 18:44.355
You just got to be
todd the apostle.

18:44.357 --> 18:48.092
Adult adam: <i> Hearing that,</i>
<i> coming from the woman</i>
<i> who loved me too much,</i>

18:48.094 --> 18:51.529
<i> Meant that it was time</i>
<i> for me to hang up my skates.</i>

18:51.531 --> 18:53.531
It's probably for the best.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.799
Dana's not talking to me,

18:54.801 --> 18:57.568
And sanjeev
did break his collarbone.

18:57.936 --> 19:00.838
But thanks for always
believing in me, mama.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.442
(sighs) even when
you probably shouldn't.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.081
I'll never stop.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.890
Hey.
Busy.

19:19.158 --> 19:24.529
Too busy for
the greatest rivalry
in the history of hockey?

19:24.531 --> 19:27.698
The flyers-rangers game?
No way!

19:28.700 --> 19:30.701
Still not interested.

19:30.802 --> 19:32.270
What if we stay
till the end?

19:32.272 --> 19:34.138
And get stuck
in traffic?

19:34.140 --> 19:36.107
Why would you
ever do that?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.709
I miss you.

19:39.378 --> 19:40.411
Say it again.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.279
(scoffs) no.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.515
You love me more
than you hate traffic.
Say it!

19:44.517 --> 19:45.550
You're a moron.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.584
Say the words.
No.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.685
Say the words.
No.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.986
Say the words.
Say the words.
No. No. No.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.588
Say the words.
Say the words.
No. No. No.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.089
Say the words.
Say the words.
No. No. No.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.925
Adult adam: <i> My dad</i>
<i> never said the words,</i>

19:53.927 --> 19:54.926
<i> But barry knew</i>
<i> he meant them</i>

19:54.928 --> 19:56.994
<i> When he heard</i>
<i> the final buzzer.</i>

19:56.996 --> 19:58.029
(buzzer buzzing)

19:58.031 --> 19:58.596
(all cheering)

19:58.598 --> 20:00.198
Adult adam: <i> It wasn't</i>
<i> a historical hockey moment,</i>

20:00.200 --> 20:02.667
<i> But it was</i>
<i> a historical night</i>
<i> for the goldberg's...</i>

20:02.669 --> 20:06.504
<i> The first time any of us</i>
<i> saw the end of a game.</i>

20:06.506 --> 20:09.407
<i> And, sure, they got stuck</i>
<i> in traffic for two hours</i>

20:09.409 --> 20:11.342
<i> And complained</i>
<i> the whole time...</i>

20:11.344 --> 20:13.945
Murray: Whoa! What?
What is she doing?

20:13.947 --> 20:14.478
(groaning)

20:14.480 --> 20:15.646
Adult adam:
<i> But my dad didn't care</i>

20:15.648 --> 20:20.785
<i> 'cause it meant being stuck</i>
<i> for two hours with his kid.</i>

20:20.787 --> 20:22.687
<i> And turns out,</i>
<i> miss cinoman was right.</i>

20:22.689 --> 20:24.922
<i> There are no small roles,</i>

20:24.924 --> 20:26.457
<i> Only small actors.</i>

20:26.459 --> 20:27.158
(audience applauding)

20:27.160 --> 20:30.061
<i> I was the greatest</i>
<i> 30th apostle</i>
<i> at the kids' table</i>

20:30.063 --> 20:31.262
<i> The world had ever seen.</i>

20:31.264 --> 20:34.198
I love you,
todd the apostle!

20:34.200 --> 20:37.368
Adult adam:
<i> And it felt great.</i>

20:37.370 --> 20:39.537
Beverly: Whoo!

20:41.506 --> 20:43.641
(dinging)

20:47.346 --> 20:51.682
<i> ¶ can it be</i>
<i> what it seems?</i>

20:51.684 --> 20:55.419
<i> ¶ there will be</i>
<i> no more love</i>

20:55.421 --> 20:59.290
<i> ¶ there will be</i>
<i> no more dreams ¶</i>

21:02.094 --> 21:02.927
(shouting) come on!

21:02.929 --> 21:06.197
Green light, people!
Green light!

21:06.199 --> 21:08.199
One car went through!

21:08.201 --> 21:09.400
One car!

21:09.402 --> 21:11.135
Move it, lady!

21:11.137 --> 21:12.837
What are you,
sally field?

21:12.839 --> 21:14.739
Put your makeup on
at home!

21:14.741 --> 21:16.607
Oh, there's a baby
on board?

21:16.609 --> 21:20.544
I'll tell you what,
there's a moron on board!

21:20.546 --> 21:21.045
Moron!

21:21.047 --> 21:23.180
Son of a...
(screaming)

21:23.182 --> 21:24.548
(screaming)

21:24.550 --> 21:26.217
Car full of morons!
