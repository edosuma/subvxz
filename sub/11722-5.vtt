00:00.078 --> 00:01.328
Previously on
"the secret circle"...

00:01.881 --> 00:04.717
My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,

00:04.718 --> 00:06.051
and for that I am so sorry.

00:06.119 --> 00:07.503
I didn't want you
to have this life,

00:07.587 --> 00:09.839
but destiny's not easy
to run from.

00:09.923 --> 00:11.123
Hi. I'm Diana.

00:11.174 --> 00:12.641
You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.

00:12.726 --> 00:14.310
- We're different.
- You're different.

00:14.394 --> 00:17.930
You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.

00:17.981 --> 00:20.082
Here we have
real power now.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.817
A complete circle is 6.

00:21.902 --> 00:22.818
You complete
the circle.

00:22.903 --> 00:24.270
She's got the gift.

00:24.337 --> 00:26.655
You can get Cassie
to do what we need?

00:26.723 --> 00:29.141
The circle will take care
of that without even knowing it.

00:29.209 --> 00:31.827
And my mother did something to
Heather that was worse than death.

00:31.912 --> 00:33.812
She hasn't moved
in 16 years.

00:34.241 --> 00:36.542
She had to be the one
to put the spell on Heather.

00:36.627 --> 00:38.744
Wherever there are witches,
evil follows.

00:38.829 --> 00:41.030
They were trying to use
your mother's power.

00:41.081 --> 00:43.049
I tell you, she was
trying to stop.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.500
Demons!

00:44.551 --> 00:46.385
We need to know what
happened 16 years ago.

01:05.087 --> 01:07.423
Wake up. We're late.

01:07.491 --> 01:09.609
Are you dead? Hmm?

01:14.915 --> 01:17.566
Oh.

01:17.618 --> 01:21.037
Ohh. Oh, I have
such a headache.

01:26.293 --> 01:27.293
Mmm...

01:27.377 --> 01:30.346
Ugh! Get off!

01:31.215 --> 01:32.598
What the hell?

01:32.683 --> 01:34.433
I said my head hurts.

01:34.518 --> 01:40.422
I'm sorry.
I just really don't feel well.

02:17.895 --> 02:21.063
Did you get any sleep
last night?

02:22.649 --> 02:25.017
A little.

02:25.102 --> 02:28.470
I can't believe you witnessed
that terrible accident.

02:28.522 --> 02:30.656
Poor woman.

02:30.724 --> 02:32.408
I know.

02:32.475 --> 02:34.310
She was a friend
of your mom's--

02:34.361 --> 02:36.162
Heather Barnes.
Did you know that?

02:36.229 --> 02:38.497
No.

02:38.582 --> 02:41.417
She'd been ill
for a very long time.

02:41.484 --> 02:43.419
Homebound.

02:43.486 --> 02:45.321
I can't imagine
what she was doing

02:45.372 --> 02:47.156
in this neighborhood.

02:49.710 --> 02:51.961
What were you doing
last night?

02:52.012 --> 02:56.849
Um, nothing, you know,
just coming home.

02:56.934 --> 02:58.834
Where from?

02:58.885 --> 03:00.553
Uh, nowhere.

03:00.637 --> 03:02.004
Just hanging out.

03:02.055 --> 03:04.774
Oh, with Diana,
Faye Chamberlain, those girls?

03:04.841 --> 03:07.360
Yeah. Is that bad?

03:07.444 --> 03:08.444
No. Not at all.

03:08.511 --> 03:10.529
I'm glad you've made
friends so quickly.

03:10.614 --> 03:14.033
It makes sense, I guess,

03:14.117 --> 03:15.985
that you'd find each other.

03:16.036 --> 03:17.320
What do you mean?

03:17.371 --> 03:20.522
Just that you have
so much in common.

03:20.574 --> 03:23.125
Your parents were all
such close friends.

03:25.862 --> 03:28.748
Well, it's a small town,
I guess.

03:28.832 --> 03:32.918
Your mother and her friends
went through a lot together.

03:33.003 --> 03:36.555
Ultimately,
a lot of tragedy.

03:37.540 --> 03:41.560
Um, I should get going.

03:41.645 --> 03:44.213
School.

03:44.264 --> 03:47.400
How about I make us
a nice dinner tonight?

03:47.484 --> 03:49.185
I'd love to catch up.

03:49.236 --> 03:50.987
Sure.

03:53.106 --> 03:55.557
There's nothing that you
can't talk to me about.

03:55.609 --> 03:57.943
You know that, right?

03:59.663 --> 04:01.580
Mm-hmm.

04:22.585 --> 04:23.936
Watch it!

04:24.021 --> 04:26.138
I beg your pardon?

04:26.223 --> 04:27.756
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Chamberlain.

04:27.808 --> 04:29.942
I don't know what's
gotten into me today.

04:30.027 --> 04:31.394
I just feel
really awful.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.980
Ok, it's fine. Just, please,
watch where you're going.

04:35.065 --> 04:37.817
I will. I'm sorry.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.790
Why can't I tell
my grandmother?

04:44.875 --> 04:46.292
Maybe she can help us.

04:46.376 --> 04:48.961
What if she tells my dad or any
of our parents? Then what?

04:49.046 --> 04:51.630
I have no idea what.
You tell me.

04:51.715 --> 04:53.466
They've lied to us
our whole lives.

04:53.550 --> 04:55.451
They obviously don't
want us to know anything.

04:55.502 --> 04:58.471
If they find out we do,
this might all be taken away.

04:58.555 --> 05:00.389
Our magic? How?

05:00.457 --> 05:02.058
One of the last entries
in my book

05:02.125 --> 05:04.793
talks about our parents' circle
being punished for their actions,

05:04.845 --> 05:06.295
having their powers
stripped away.

05:06.346 --> 05:07.296
By who?

05:07.347 --> 05:09.098
The book refers
to the Elders.

05:09.149 --> 05:11.484
We think that means
the generation before.

05:11.568 --> 05:13.269
Like my grandmother.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.637
So she still has
her powers?

05:15.689 --> 05:17.323
I think so.
All the more reason

05:17.407 --> 05:18.991
not to tell her
we're practicing it.

05:19.076 --> 05:22.161
I hate lying. I'm supposed to
have dinner with her later.

05:22.245 --> 05:24.280
Another night of pretending
to be someone I'm not.

05:24.331 --> 05:27.267
I get it, believe me.
But the answers we all want

05:27.268 --> 05:29.212
about what happened
16 years ago,

05:29.536 --> 05:33.655
what if exposing ourselves
means we never find out?

05:41.181 --> 05:43.849
Heather Barnes was killed outside
the Blake house last night.

05:43.934 --> 05:45.301
Yes, I'm well aware.

05:45.352 --> 05:47.803
Right in front of our kids.

05:47.854 --> 05:49.522
You think she said
anything to them?

05:49.606 --> 05:51.724
She was supposed to be
catatonic for the rest of her life.

05:51.808 --> 05:54.810
I'm not even sure how she was
able to get out her front door.

05:54.878 --> 05:56.137
But we always knew binding
the circle might attract

05:56.162 --> 05:57.362
unwanted attention.

05:57.564 --> 05:58.823
But I never thought
they'd face this kind

05:58.824 --> 06:00.024
of danger, not so soon.

06:01.184 --> 06:03.803
The more they're confronted
with, the more they'll dig.

06:03.870 --> 06:05.534
And we're not equipped yet
to protect them

06:05.559 --> 06:06.759
from what they might find.

06:07.023 --> 06:09.691
We will be.
The Blood Moon's tonight

06:09.743 --> 06:11.327
and I've got
everything ready.

06:11.378 --> 06:13.212
Be at the boat at 10:00.

06:13.296 --> 06:14.580
You don't want to miss it.

06:14.664 --> 06:17.533
No, we don't.

06:17.584 --> 06:19.701
What do you say
we go back to using phones

06:19.753 --> 06:21.587
for these kind
of conversations?

06:23.890 --> 06:26.675
It's so nice to see you
in person.

06:32.882 --> 06:35.017
Oh, your dad's here.

06:35.068 --> 06:38.237
You're probably
getting expelled.

06:38.321 --> 06:39.822
You don't know?

06:39.889 --> 06:41.223
Know what?

06:41.274 --> 06:43.225
Our parents are dating.

06:43.276 --> 06:45.828
It's cute, huh?

07:22.532 --> 07:24.066
Uhh!

07:27.320 --> 07:29.738
God!

07:32.742 --> 07:34.877
Aah!

07:35.879 --> 07:37.296
Are you ok?

07:52.178 --> 07:53.462
Nick.

07:53.513 --> 07:54.897
Yeah, Nick.

07:54.964 --> 07:56.348
Are you all right?

07:56.433 --> 07:58.467
Yeah, I'm fine.
But I need your help.

07:58.518 --> 07:59.801
What?

07:59.853 --> 08:02.021
I found my family's
Book of Shadows.

08:02.105 --> 08:03.105
Seriously?

08:03.156 --> 08:04.573
Mm-hmm. But I don't
want the others to know.

08:04.641 --> 08:05.824
Where'd you find it?

08:05.909 --> 08:07.976
I was looking
for a necklace
in my mom's stuff

08:08.028 --> 08:10.529
and I found her diary.
She writes all about

08:10.614 --> 08:13.165
hiding our family's book in
the forest for protection.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.500
Will you help me
find it?

08:14.584 --> 08:18.087
It'd just be for us,
you and me,

08:18.154 --> 08:20.339
doing all the spells?

08:20.407 --> 08:22.424
That could be fun.

08:22.492 --> 08:25.160
Our secret.

08:35.171 --> 08:36.889
You must have
read it wrong.

08:36.972 --> 08:38.107
There's nothing down here.

08:38.174 --> 08:40.442
Trust me, it's there.

08:40.510 --> 08:43.345
I am done. I'm about
to pass out.

08:43.395 --> 08:46.532
Stop being such a wuss
and dig.

08:50.904 --> 08:52.121
Hey.

08:59.796 --> 09:01.964
What the hell?

09:02.031 --> 09:03.465
This thing weighs a ton.

09:03.533 --> 09:06.552
Uhh! Uh!

09:07.537 --> 09:10.389
Are you sure
the book's in there?

09:10.473 --> 09:14.293
This is exactly
what we're looking for.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.211
How's the chicken?

09:23.296 --> 09:25.397
Mmm. Delicious.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.649
Thank you.

09:27.717 --> 09:29.784
School?

09:30.803 --> 09:32.470
Fine.

09:32.538 --> 09:35.707
You know, it's school.

09:35.775 --> 09:39.594
Pretty soon we're gonna be
talking about the weather.

09:41.814 --> 09:45.100
Sorry.

09:50.723 --> 09:51.906
What?

09:51.974 --> 09:55.243
The way you just
wrinkled your nose

09:55.328 --> 09:57.746
exactly like your mom.

09:57.813 --> 10:00.749
Really?

10:00.833 --> 10:03.568
What was she like,
at my age?

10:03.619 --> 10:05.903
Well, like you,
beautiful.

10:05.955 --> 10:08.239
Strong.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.925
So smart.

10:12.578 --> 10:15.013
Why did she leave here?

10:15.081 --> 10:18.316
Your mother kept
a lot of things from me.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.885
She didn't think
I'd understand.

10:20.936 --> 10:22.354
You might feel
the same way.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.938
When she was in trouble,

10:24.023 --> 10:27.091
I did not see the signs.

10:27.143 --> 10:30.712
If we were closer,
if she'd come to me,

10:30.780 --> 10:32.597
I could have helped.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.118
I'll never forgive myself.

10:40.990 --> 10:43.958
You know, once mom
got something in her head...

10:44.043 --> 10:47.379
Ah. See? You know her
better than you think.

10:50.082 --> 10:53.868
Please don't make
the same mistake, Cassie.

11:05.481 --> 11:07.315
Everything ok?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.933
Fine.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.602
Ready for dessert?

11:10.653 --> 11:12.020
Actually, I have to
meet someone.

11:12.104 --> 11:14.072
But I won't be late.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.574
Thank you for the dinner.

11:16.642 --> 11:17.909
Mm.

11:17.976 --> 11:20.662
I'll be back soon.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.152
Well, let's just open it.

11:28.204 --> 11:29.771
What's your problem?
Don't touch it.

11:29.839 --> 11:31.039
This is what
you wanted--the book.

11:31.123 --> 11:34.059
My mom put a spell on it
to protect it and keep it safe.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.227
It won't open until
we undo the spell.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.796
I'll get it started.

11:37.847 --> 11:39.664
The lock's ancient.

11:39.715 --> 11:41.516
I bet I can get it open.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.851
No means no.
Do you get it?

11:42.935 --> 11:45.186
What's the emergency?

11:45.271 --> 11:47.906
Tell me this has nothing
to do with your sex life.

11:47.973 --> 11:49.140
It's a surprise.

11:49.191 --> 11:51.976
Just give me a minute
to prepare the spell.

11:52.027 --> 11:53.645
You text me
to rush over here

11:53.696 --> 11:55.864
and now you want me
to wait.

11:55.931 --> 11:58.566
With him.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.536
Wait!

12:03.322 --> 12:05.323
I found my mom's
Book of Shadows.

12:05.374 --> 12:08.543
Hey. I thought we said we
weren't gonna tell anybody.

12:08.627 --> 12:11.729
She's my best friend.
Don't be an idiot.

12:11.797 --> 12:15.216
Another book.
Really?

12:15.301 --> 12:16.551
Where?

12:20.473 --> 12:21.723
So, let's open it.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.558
There's a spell
on the lock.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.963
Did you tell Diana
about this?

12:29.031 --> 12:31.382
No. Just us.

12:31.433 --> 12:32.684
And him?

12:32.751 --> 12:35.353
I needed him
to dig up the suitcase.

12:35.404 --> 12:37.188
The book is for you and me.

12:37.239 --> 12:39.223
I thought the book
was for you and me.

12:39.275 --> 12:42.143
Are you gonna hold it
over me like Diana does?

12:42.211 --> 12:44.061
Never.

12:44.113 --> 12:47.282
You're my best friend.

12:47.366 --> 12:49.584
There is nothing

12:49.668 --> 12:52.337
I wouldn't do for you.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.007
Uh--

13:02.131 --> 13:04.415
Hi, Dawn.

13:04.466 --> 13:05.800
Am I early?

13:05.885 --> 13:06.851
You said 10:00.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.353
No, you're right on time.

13:10.022 --> 13:11.105
Wine?

13:11.190 --> 13:12.974
No. Um...

13:13.058 --> 13:14.976
We've got work to do.

13:15.060 --> 13:17.862
Of course. I've got
everything set up.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.815
I just need to light
these candles.

13:22.267 --> 13:25.153
We've still got
15 minutes.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.488
You sure you don't
want something to drink?

13:29.992 --> 13:31.543
Fine.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.629
You want these crystals
as much as I do, right?

13:34.713 --> 13:36.714
Of course I do.

13:37.917 --> 13:41.469
To get our true power
back, it means everything.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.472
Then don't lose focus.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.544
Mmm. Since when
do you cook?

13:49.612 --> 13:51.629
Never. But I just found
the recipe online

13:51.680 --> 13:52.897
and followed directions.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.567
This was amazing.

13:56.318 --> 13:57.986
You're lying.

13:58.070 --> 14:01.773
I know, it's disgusting.
I'm a horrible cook.

14:01.824 --> 14:04.943
Not if cooks are judged on
effort and adorableness.

14:04.994 --> 14:08.296
I miss this.

14:08.364 --> 14:11.799
It feels like we haven't
been alone in forever.

14:11.867 --> 14:15.820
Remember when we were the only
two witches, me and you?

14:15.871 --> 14:17.858
Yeah, and then you had to
go and ruin everything

14:17.883 --> 14:19.083
and tell the others.

14:19.341 --> 14:22.694
Sometimes I wish I never
found the book,

14:22.761 --> 14:25.196
that it was just
you and me again,

14:25.264 --> 14:27.432
being normal.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.468
Well, maybe tomorrow
I'll cook you something horrible.

14:34.356 --> 14:36.641
Time for dessert.

14:46.068 --> 14:49.404
Should I get bowls
or spoons?

14:49.488 --> 14:52.457
We're not gonna need
any of them.

14:52.524 --> 14:54.575

What the hell, Melissa?

15:41.340 --> 15:43.407
How many witches does it take
to open a suitcase?

15:43.459 --> 15:45.026
Six, I think.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.627
- What?
- I'm sorry.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.379
I didn't think you'd come
if you knew,

15:48.430 --> 15:52.083
but we need the entire circle
for this spell to work.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.352
Why? What's in there?

15:54.419 --> 15:55.887
Melissa's
Book of Shadows.

15:55.938 --> 15:57.939
Really? Well, let's see it.

15:58.023 --> 16:02.360
Why is everyone in such a rush
to open the damn suitcase?!

16:03.862 --> 16:07.198
Why don't I check to see
where Adam and Diane are?

16:07.265 --> 16:09.567
Tell them to hurry. They haven't
been responding to my texts.

16:09.618 --> 16:11.703
Yes, definitely
tell them to hurry.

16:13.038 --> 16:14.271
Did you see that?

16:14.323 --> 16:17.241
- What's wrong?
- This suitcase moved.

16:17.292 --> 16:18.826
Suitcases don't move.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.661
This one did. Ohh!

16:20.746 --> 16:21.913
It moved again.

16:21.964 --> 16:23.664
Just stay away from it!

16:23.749 --> 16:28.169
Melissa,

It's Cassie.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.536
They're in trouble.

17:57.926 --> 17:59.977
What the hell
was with her face?

18:00.045 --> 18:01.229
It's the same thing
that was in Heather.

18:01.313 --> 18:02.597
A demon?

18:02.681 --> 18:04.098
I guess. I've never seen
a demon before.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.350
Do they look like snakes
and crawl inside people's skin?

18:06.401 --> 18:07.735
Let's get the hell
out of here.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.071
No, we can't leave. We have
to get that thing out of her.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.106
How? My mother
couldn't help Heather,

18:12.191 --> 18:13.658
and we don't know
half the magic that they did.

18:13.725 --> 18:16.327
I don't care.
We have to save her.

18:16.394 --> 18:18.112
- You're right.
- Fine. How?

18:18.197 --> 18:19.914
- Guys?
- I don't know.

18:19.998 --> 18:21.999
Are you ok?

18:24.953 --> 18:27.038
Uhh!
What the hell?

18:31.009 --> 18:33.878
It's not what you think.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.797
Not even remotely.

18:40.164 --> 18:42.178
I guess it's possible
the demon got out of Heather

18:42.179 --> 18:43.413
and found its way
into Melissa.

18:44.203 --> 18:45.837
So what's in the suitcase?

18:45.921 --> 18:51.125
Well, I'm guessing
it's not a Book of Shadows.

18:51.176 --> 18:53.160
Aah!

18:53.212 --> 18:54.262
Aah!

18:54.329 --> 18:55.263
I got her.
Hold her, Nick.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.297
Grab her arm.
I got her! Tighter!

18:56.348 --> 18:57.348
Let go of me!

18:57.433 --> 18:59.183
Get off me!

18:59.268 --> 19:00.301
Aah!

19:03.503 --> 19:04.703
Get away, Jess.
Get away.

19:07.559 --> 19:10.061
What just happened?

19:16.368 --> 19:18.486
Melissa?

19:18.537 --> 19:20.238
Nick.

19:21.790 --> 19:25.259
Oh, my head.

19:26.578 --> 19:28.746
What happened?

19:30.666 --> 19:33.418
What's going on? Why are you
all staring at me like that?

19:33.485 --> 19:34.585
Are you ok?

19:34.653 --> 19:36.888
I can't feel my hands.

19:36.972 --> 19:38.506
These things are
cutting into me.

19:38.557 --> 19:39.707
Let's get
these things off.

19:39.758 --> 19:41.059
Don't do that.

19:41.143 --> 19:42.393
It's not her.

19:42.478 --> 19:43.711
Of course it is.

19:43.762 --> 19:45.079
No, she's faking.

19:45.147 --> 19:46.981
Nick, don't listen to them.
I'm in pain.

20:09.254 --> 20:12.757
You worthless loser!

20:18.931 --> 20:22.016
What are we gonna do?
She's going to hurt herself.

20:22.084 --> 20:24.302
We can't just keep her
tied up forever.

20:24.386 --> 20:27.588
I can try the book, but it's
way out of my league.

20:30.442 --> 20:32.060
I know what to do.

20:32.127 --> 20:34.695
But you have to trust me.

20:47.493 --> 20:48.876
It's time.

20:48.944 --> 20:51.796
Let's do it.

20:55.918 --> 20:58.469
This crystal will absorb
the moon's light,

20:58.554 --> 21:01.472
refract it onto the map,
and identify the others

21:01.557 --> 21:04.225
in relation
to its position.

21:04.292 --> 21:07.294
Six crystals, once joined
together as one...

21:07.346 --> 21:10.765
and connected even now.

21:10.816 --> 21:14.318
Thrughain adhar,

21:14.403 --> 21:17.939
thruagort isham.

21:17.990 --> 21:21.475
Thrughain adhar,

21:21.527 --> 21:25.279
thruagort isham.

21:25.330 --> 21:29.333
Thrughain adhar,

21:29.418 --> 21:32.120
thruagort isham.

21:32.171 --> 21:34.956
Thrughain...

21:35.007 --> 21:36.824
Adhar...

21:36.875 --> 21:40.378
Thruagort isham.

21:46.885 --> 21:48.603
No.

21:50.522 --> 21:51.889
There's not enough power.

21:51.974 --> 21:53.307
- Let's try it again.
- The crystal's dead.

21:53.358 --> 21:54.642
We used it too often.
Damn it.

21:54.693 --> 21:55.560
Just give me
your hands--

21:55.644 --> 21:57.445
Don't you get it, Charles?

21:57.512 --> 21:59.680
It's done.

21:59.731 --> 22:03.017
We waited a year
for this Blood Moon.

22:03.068 --> 22:05.352
But at least
we've bound the circle.

22:05.404 --> 22:07.720
Without 5 more of these,
the circle can't restore

22:07.745 --> 22:08.945
a power. We have nothing.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.209
Look, I'll find
another way.

22:11.293 --> 22:13.327
No.

22:13.378 --> 22:16.030
I was an idiot to think
you could help me.

22:23.038 --> 22:25.973
Grandma!

22:26.041 --> 22:27.975
What is it?
Are you all right?

22:28.043 --> 22:30.311
You said you can help me.
You said I can trust you.

22:30.378 --> 22:32.213
Of course you can.
Slow down. Catch your breath.

22:32.264 --> 22:34.015
There's no time.
We're in trouble.

22:34.066 --> 22:35.716
Who is? Tell me what's wrong.

22:35.767 --> 22:38.052
I know who I am.

22:38.103 --> 22:40.404
Who you are,
who mom was.

22:40.489 --> 22:43.491
I'm a witch.

22:43.558 --> 22:46.227
And I need your help.

22:53.220 --> 22:56.039
Was that a hiss?

22:56.090 --> 22:59.843
Rrarrrhh!

22:59.894 --> 23:00.844
Uhh!

23:00.895 --> 23:03.600
Do as I say or I will
cut his throat!

23:04.602 --> 23:07.271
Melissa, don't do this.
Melissa, please.

23:07.355 --> 23:09.990
Listen. Hey, come on.

23:11.659 --> 23:13.360
Come on, fight it.
Please.

23:13.411 --> 23:15.112
Fight it. I know
you're in there.

23:15.196 --> 23:16.246
I know you can hear me.

23:16.331 --> 23:18.916
Yes. And I am telling you

23:19.000 --> 23:20.417
to shut up!

23:20.502 --> 23:22.035
Melissa, no!

23:22.086 --> 23:22.953
Aah!

23:23.037 --> 23:24.338
Come on,
there's 3 of us.

23:24.405 --> 23:25.339
Don't mess around.

23:25.406 --> 23:26.623
We're not doing
what she says.

23:26.708 --> 23:27.674
Faye, no.

23:27.742 --> 23:29.426
Focus on the shears.

23:29.511 --> 23:32.379
Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.

23:32.430 --> 23:34.882
Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.

23:34.933 --> 23:37.017
Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.

23:37.084 --> 23:39.720
Heat of the sun, burn like fire.

23:39.771 --> 23:41.221
Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.

23:41.272 --> 23:43.357
Heat of the sun, burn like fire.

23:43.424 --> 23:45.893
Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.

23:45.944 --> 23:46.894
Heat of the sun, burn like fire.

23:46.945 --> 23:48.312
Hey, stop, stop.

23:48.396 --> 23:51.031
Any other magic tricks
you want to try?

23:51.099 --> 23:54.601
No? My turn.

23:54.652 --> 23:59.573
Faye, use that to form
a circle around the case.

23:59.624 --> 24:00.974
Please just do it.

24:11.302 --> 24:13.086
Now say this with me--

24:13.137 --> 24:17.307
incipio serpus malum.

24:17.375 --> 24:18.592
Say it!

24:18.643 --> 24:21.979
Incipio serpus malum.

24:22.063 --> 24:24.398
Incipio serpus malum.

24:24.465 --> 24:26.333
Incipio serpus malum.

24:26.401 --> 24:28.485
Incipio serpus malum.

24:28.570 --> 24:30.487
Incipio serpus malum.

24:30.555 --> 24:32.773
Incipio serpus malum.

24:32.824 --> 24:35.192
Incipio serpus malum!

24:35.276 --> 24:38.195
I brought help.

24:40.281 --> 24:42.115
What...

24:42.166 --> 24:44.334
You're too late!

24:44.419 --> 24:46.503
Kleidaria klodanum.

24:49.340 --> 24:50.874
- Repeat the spell.
- No!

24:50.942 --> 24:55.312
Then his blood
is on your hands!

24:56.831 --> 24:58.181
Aah! Uhh!

25:00.334 --> 25:02.719
You bitch.

25:02.804 --> 25:05.522
You don't have the power
to stop me,

25:05.607 --> 25:06.607
old woman.

25:06.674 --> 25:07.841
I'm not alone here.

25:07.892 --> 25:10.527
What, them?
They're nothing.

25:10.612 --> 25:12.512
I didn't mean the children.

25:14.032 --> 25:16.182
Get that away from m-me.

25:16.234 --> 25:17.517
Cassie, get my bag.

25:17.568 --> 25:19.870
Someone break that circle.
Hurry.

25:21.789 --> 25:25.358
Take the 3 candles.
Place them around the bag.

25:25.410 --> 25:26.827
Light them in a circle
clockwise.

25:26.878 --> 25:29.579
Now the sage.
Burn some in each candle.

25:29.664 --> 25:32.549
Hurry up.
We don't have much time.

25:33.651 --> 25:36.503
Melissa? Melissa,
I know you're in there.

25:36.554 --> 25:40.557
I saw you. I saw you.
Come back to me.

25:42.543 --> 25:44.645
Come back to me, please.

25:48.382 --> 25:50.317
White wine, please.

25:50.384 --> 25:53.820
No. Uh, bourbon.

25:56.607 --> 25:58.725
Stop! What is going on?!

25:58.776 --> 26:01.244
Cassie, get the stick
out of the bag.

26:01.329 --> 26:02.245
No!

26:02.330 --> 26:04.414
Consummetum est.

26:04.499 --> 26:05.415
Light it.

26:05.500 --> 26:08.085
No, please.

26:08.169 --> 26:11.288
Oh, God. No!

26:11.372 --> 26:13.123
No, stop it!
Diablo fuge.

26:13.207 --> 26:14.458
Diablo fuge.
Stop it!

26:14.542 --> 26:15.592
Stop!

26:15.677 --> 26:18.745
Oh, Nick, help me, please!

26:18.796 --> 26:21.414
She's not possessed.
Let her go.

26:21.466 --> 26:25.635
Possessed?
What are you talking about?

26:25.720 --> 26:26.720
The demon's gone?

26:26.771 --> 26:28.772
From Melissa,
but it needs a host.

26:28.856 --> 26:30.891
It's in someone else.

26:30.942 --> 26:32.225
Someone in this room.

26:32.276 --> 26:36.029
How do you know
it's not him?

26:36.097 --> 26:37.197
Diana, come on.

26:37.264 --> 26:39.733
It could be anyone.

26:39.784 --> 26:41.118
Yeah, well,
I vote for you.

26:41.202 --> 26:42.813
What about grandma?

26:42.838 --> 26:44.232
She's the one with
all the crazy ideas.

26:44.233 --> 26:46.418
- She saved us.
- Stop!

27:18.239 --> 27:20.140
Stop!

27:20.191 --> 27:21.825
Stop!

27:24.812 --> 27:26.246
Stop him! Stop him!

27:27.815 --> 27:28.982
Nick!

27:35.499 --> 27:36.949
Carefully.

27:37.036 --> 27:37.992
What are they?

27:38.022 --> 27:39.456
Demons, in the form
of snakes.

27:39.523 --> 27:40.690
Do you have
any lighter fluid?

27:40.741 --> 27:44.461
Um...Yeah, right there
on the table.

27:45.362 --> 27:46.830
The only way
to destroy a demon

27:46.881 --> 27:48.197
is to drown it

27:48.249 --> 27:50.333
or burn it.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.587
Right here.
Ok.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.089
On the concrete.

27:56.173 --> 27:57.424
1...

27:57.508 --> 27:58.425
2...

27:58.509 --> 28:00.043
3!

28:02.396 --> 28:05.432
- The lock!
- Take these.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.060
Get back!

28:21.332 --> 28:23.283
No, get back!

28:25.503 --> 28:28.538
Oh!

28:37.098 --> 28:38.548
Oh--ohh!

29:11.966 --> 29:14.834
We have to find Nick
before he hurts someone.

29:14.919 --> 29:18.555
I'll call his aunt and tell her
to call if he shows up there.

29:18.622 --> 29:20.456
What's he trying to do?

29:20.508 --> 29:23.426
I mean it--
what does it want?

29:23.477 --> 29:26.796
Possession. Demons need human
form to be fully active.

29:26.814 --> 29:29.833
And there's no more
powerful form than a witch.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.604
It's Nick.

29:38.776 --> 29:41.611
Adam, I'm gonna need you
to bring me the suitcase

29:41.679 --> 29:42.812
to the boathouse.

29:42.863 --> 29:45.331
If you don't,
I'm gonna burn this place

29:45.416 --> 29:46.750
to the ground.

29:46.817 --> 29:49.252
You can check,
but I'm pretty sure

29:49.319 --> 29:52.372
your dad's passed out
in the back room.

29:56.994 --> 29:59.465
He wants me to bring him
the suitcase or he'll

29:59.490 --> 30:00.690
burn down the boathouse.

30:01.498 --> 30:04.217
My dad's in there.

30:05.102 --> 30:06.019
I'll go.

30:06.103 --> 30:07.637
I'm coming with.

30:07.688 --> 30:09.355
- No.
- Yes.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.523
You're gonna need help.

30:10.608 --> 30:12.508
Then we're coming, too.

30:19.900 --> 30:22.118
Hello, Dawn.

30:22.186 --> 30:25.205
Hello, Nick.

30:25.289 --> 30:27.624
It's Ms. Chamberlain
to you.

30:29.910 --> 30:32.712
Nick's not here anymore.

30:32.797 --> 30:36.199
And who are you?

30:36.250 --> 30:41.171
I believe the name you used
when you helped summon me was...

30:41.238 --> 30:43.873
Abaddon.

30:43.924 --> 30:45.809
We meet again.

30:45.876 --> 30:47.043
Oh, my God.

30:47.094 --> 30:49.212
We have unfinished business.

30:49.263 --> 30:50.346
What do you want?

30:50.397 --> 30:54.250
I've come to do
what I was meant to do.

30:54.318 --> 30:55.985
I want the circle.

30:56.053 --> 30:57.320
No.

30:57.387 --> 30:59.405
Leave the children alone.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.774
They're coming here now.

31:01.842 --> 31:04.494
For Nick.

31:04.561 --> 31:07.664
I need a new body.

31:07.731 --> 31:10.233
Yours will do fine.

31:12.953 --> 31:15.338
Not here.

31:31.856 --> 31:33.389
Hello?

31:33.440 --> 31:36.142
Let's go someplace private.

31:36.210 --> 31:38.945
What about the drydocks?

31:39.029 --> 31:41.281
Nobody can hear us there.

31:41.365 --> 31:44.067
We can talk this out, Nick--

31:44.118 --> 31:45.702
or Abaddon--no one else needs

31:45.769 --> 31:47.487
to be killed.

31:53.944 --> 31:56.129
Do whatever
you want to me.

31:56.213 --> 31:58.498
Just, please,
leave them alone.

31:58.582 --> 32:00.917
I'm afraid I can't do that.

32:00.968 --> 32:03.303
I just want
what you want--

32:03.387 --> 32:06.556
the circle.
Their power.

32:06.623 --> 32:09.092
They're not strong.

32:09.143 --> 32:11.094
They don't know anything.

32:11.145 --> 32:13.796
They're strong.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.484
What now?

32:18.569 --> 32:21.137
You know what
we have to do.

32:22.990 --> 32:24.221
The crystal has no energy.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.858
And without that power,
there's nothing else we can do.

32:25.859 --> 32:27.277
We have to drown it.

32:27.328 --> 32:28.444
For God's sake, Dawn.

32:28.495 --> 32:30.380
He was coming
for the children, Charles.

32:30.447 --> 32:31.981
All of them.

32:32.032 --> 32:34.617
We don't have a choice,

32:34.668 --> 32:36.169
and you know it.

32:36.253 --> 32:38.254
It's a risk,
but drowning the demon

32:38.322 --> 32:39.756
is the only way
to save them.

32:43.377 --> 32:45.044
Come on.

32:47.431 --> 32:49.498
Damn it, Nick,
where are you?

32:49.550 --> 32:52.135
I'll check outside.

32:52.186 --> 32:54.520
I'll check the back.

33:28.672 --> 33:30.590
Mr. Meade.
What are you doing?

33:30.674 --> 33:33.426
Don't listen to him.
That's not Nick.

33:33.510 --> 33:36.479
Stop it, please.
Please! Please, stop!

33:36.546 --> 33:37.847
Stop it! Stop!

33:37.898 --> 33:39.382
Do it quickly.

33:39.433 --> 33:40.900
Please stop--

34:13.050 --> 34:14.851
- Damn it.
- What's happening?

34:14.918 --> 34:15.918
He won't die.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.053
Nick.

34:17.103 --> 34:19.022
Don't let him up!

35:02.984 --> 35:05.635
How do you feel?

35:05.687 --> 35:08.855
Mm...Ok.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.274
What happened?

35:11.326 --> 35:12.776
You don't remember?

35:12.827 --> 35:14.411
Demons.

35:14.478 --> 35:16.496
Possession.

35:16.581 --> 35:19.833
Being really mean to me.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.820
Ever since I woke up
this morning,

35:23.871 --> 35:25.522
I just...

35:27.525 --> 35:30.877
Everything's
so blurry in my head.

35:30.962 --> 35:34.698
I'm really glad that you're ok.

35:36.501 --> 35:39.319
Where is everyone?
Where's Nick?

35:44.559 --> 35:46.843
Hi.

35:46.894 --> 35:49.012
Yeah.

36:02.460 --> 36:06.296
Ok.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.309
We killed a boy tonight.

36:19.377 --> 36:22.796
We killed a demon.

36:22.864 --> 36:25.132
And think of who we saved.

36:27.769 --> 36:30.353
It was the right thing to do.

36:32.156 --> 36:35.242
There was nothing right
about that.

36:37.862 --> 36:41.765
I killed a boy, a child.

36:43.951 --> 36:48.004
That's something
that should never...

36:48.072 --> 36:50.240
Feel right.

36:54.178 --> 36:58.465
You saved my life.

36:58.533 --> 37:00.183
Thank you.

37:15.133 --> 37:18.735
They're saying he hit
his head when he fell in.

37:18.803 --> 37:21.021
At least that's what
the police think.

37:21.088 --> 37:23.874
They're calling it
an accident.

37:23.941 --> 37:27.127
So he drowned?

37:27.211 --> 37:32.499
Maybe he was trying to
get the demon out himself.

37:41.309 --> 37:45.628
He always had it worse
than any of us.

37:45.680 --> 37:49.966
You know? Both parents.

37:50.017 --> 37:52.652
Never knowing
who he was.

37:52.737 --> 37:54.471
I know.

38:00.311 --> 38:04.114
If I lost you,
I couldn't take it.

38:04.165 --> 38:07.784
You're not gonna lose me.

38:07.852 --> 38:10.203
Promise?

38:18.012 --> 38:20.680
If I would have told you
about the circle sooner,

38:20.765 --> 38:24.134
he'd still be alive.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.338
It's not your fault.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.807
None of it.

38:30.858 --> 38:34.444
There have been too man
secrets for too long.

38:34.511 --> 38:38.698
And I don't want to to be like
that between us anymore.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.990
Then, please, tell me...

38:47.041 --> 38:49.326
What happened
the night of the fire?

38:49.377 --> 38:53.529
Why did my mom run away
from here? From you?

38:54.615 --> 38:57.117
I wish I knew.

38:59.303 --> 39:02.722
But I never have.

39:04.842 --> 39:07.611
I miss her.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.513
Every day.

39:10.565 --> 39:14.050
So do I.

39:14.101 --> 39:18.688
What good is magic if you can't
save the people you care about?

39:18.739 --> 39:20.807
I wish it was that simple.

39:23.527 --> 39:26.680
Ours is not
an easy life, Cassie,

39:26.747 --> 39:29.950
and witchcraft has never
been about fun and games.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.619
It's dangerous.

39:32.703 --> 39:35.639
And it attracts darkness.

39:36.958 --> 39:40.210
That is why your mom
was trying to keep it from you.

39:40.278 --> 39:44.965
Why I wanted
to keep it from her.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.749
Well...

39:46.801 --> 39:49.970
It didn't work, did it?

39:50.037 --> 39:52.088
No, it didn't.

39:52.156 --> 39:54.824
It never does.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.574
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, Cassie.

40:11.626 --> 40:13.627
I promise.
