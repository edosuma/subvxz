WEBVTT

00:06.993 --> 00:09.193
Previously on "Billions"...

00:09.195 --> 00:12.530
The key to bagging Axe
is Dollar Bill Stearn.

00:12.532 --> 00:14.766
Bill Stearn bribed the
Pepsum researcher

00:14.768 --> 00:17.668
for proprietary information for
a drug called Vaccarizine.

00:17.670 --> 00:18.869
I wanna put him on the rack

00:18.871 --> 00:21.504
and stretch him until he gives us Axe.

00:21.506 --> 00:23.273
The good news is this...
when you get out of there,

00:23.275 --> 00:25.241
you're starting at $1.4, easy.

00:25.243 --> 00:28.712
- Better news... I'll hire you.
- I'm staying.

00:28.714 --> 00:29.746
Still, Wendy's

00:29.748 --> 00:30.747
making things difficult for you.

00:30.749 --> 00:32.783
Why is she still working there?

00:32.785 --> 00:34.183
We started to discuss it.

00:34.185 --> 00:35.484
I've been working there since
before we were married

00:35.486 --> 00:37.386
and long before you were in office.

00:37.388 --> 00:39.589
Your value to the firm is absolute.

00:39.591 --> 00:40.723
Stick with me.

00:42.193 --> 00:44.060
I don't wanna be out of line,

00:44.062 --> 00:45.895
but you might wanna consider
recusing from this case.

00:45.897 --> 00:48.430
The conflict of interest...
it's gonna be an issue.

00:48.432 --> 00:49.531
So what's the minimum investment

00:49.533 --> 00:50.865
for family and friends?

00:50.867 --> 00:53.534
I promised I wouldn't take
any money away from Axe.

00:53.536 --> 00:54.903
What if he never finds out?

00:54.905 --> 00:56.270
If they bring an action,

00:56.272 --> 00:58.206
the whole strategy becomes
about leveraging a settlement.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.507
I'd never settle.

00:59.509 --> 01:00.508
William Stearn, you are under arrest...

01:00.510 --> 01:01.743
Lawyer.

01:01.745 --> 01:03.311
...for insider trading
and securities fraud.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.412
- Lawyer.
- You have the right...

01:04.414 --> 01:06.280
- Lawyer.
- ...to remain silent.

Go on ahead. Right through there.

01:59.098 --> 02:00.397
Hello?

02:08.007 --> 02:09.973
You came.

02:09.976 --> 02:11.208
Did I have a choice?

02:11.210 --> 02:12.843
You always have a choice.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.594
Come in.

02:57.286 --> 03:01.322
It's been a weird couple of days.

03:01.324 --> 03:02.757
Yeah.

03:25.012 --> 03:27.179
Hello.

03:27.181 --> 03:30.182
Did you strike a blow for
justice today, Mr. Rhoades?

03:30.184 --> 03:31.583
I do believe we did.

03:31.585 --> 03:32.852
You organized this

03:32.854 --> 03:34.419
and then made sure I wasn't
there when it happened.

03:34.421 --> 03:35.788
You're welcome.

03:35.790 --> 03:38.023
Did you consider for a second
what that was gonna do to me?

03:38.025 --> 03:39.024
Should I go?

03:39.026 --> 03:39.859
- Yes!
- Yes.

03:39.861 --> 03:42.227
Okay.

03:43.529 --> 03:45.563
My name, my absence when it happened

03:45.565 --> 03:47.198
puts me under suspicion there forever.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.767
What should I have done?

03:48.769 --> 03:52.603
Told you so that you could
be there for an arrest?

03:52.605 --> 03:55.473
And if you had been there,
you'd be even more pissed off.

03:55.475 --> 03:57.041
You don't think so, but I know it.

03:57.043 --> 03:58.441
At least then they wouldn't
think I knew it was coming.

03:58.443 --> 04:00.477
Oh, they all know it was coming.

04:00.479 --> 04:02.179
It's Judgment Day.

04:04.216 --> 04:07.217
My office is taking an
action, and there's nothing

04:07.219 --> 04:09.419
that you or anybody
there can do about it.

04:09.421 --> 04:11.922
And when that action is
finished, it will be the end.

04:11.924 --> 04:14.324
There will be nothing left.

04:14.326 --> 04:15.858
So what they think of you,

04:15.860 --> 04:17.927
you can see how that might
not matter so much.

04:17.928 --> 04:19.495
It's my job.

04:19.497 --> 04:21.096
You're beautiful and talented,

04:21.099 --> 04:22.999
and I'm sure you'll land on your feet.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.733
Fuck you.

04:27.105 --> 04:30.306
Get Emi Kenyon back in here!

04:43.887 --> 04:45.320
Hello?

05:07.209 --> 05:11.510
Yesterday, this company
came under attack

05:11.512 --> 05:14.480
by an unscrupulous adversary

05:14.482 --> 05:16.850
who will stop at nothing

05:16.852 --> 05:18.952
to abuse the authority of the state,

05:18.954 --> 05:20.686
take away our freedoms,

05:20.688 --> 05:22.621
and close our doors forever.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.089
And it left us all

05:24.091 --> 05:26.225
wondering one thing...

05:26.227 --> 05:29.494
- What happens next?

05:33.968 --> 05:37.802
Dollar Bill Stearn.

05:37.804 --> 05:40.238
Stingiest multimillionaire
on the planet.

05:41.707 --> 05:43.741
Better get ready to pay full price.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.413
Insider trading, securities fraud,

05:49.415 --> 05:52.549
conspiracy, wire fraud.
What are we up to?

05:52.551 --> 05:54.285
Uh, 12-year prison term.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.486
Mm.

05:55.488 --> 05:56.653
$9 million fine,

05:56.655 --> 05:58.889
plus civil when it moves to SEC.

05:58.891 --> 06:02.025
Jesus, that's pricey, and
that's just the beginning.

06:02.027 --> 06:04.261
They came for Dollar Bill yesterday,

06:04.263 --> 06:07.197
but it was an attack on all of us.

06:07.199 --> 06:08.431
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

06:08.433 --> 06:09.565
- That's right.
- Yeah.

06:09.567 --> 06:11.434
- And I feel it. Do you?
- Uh-huh.

06:11.436 --> 06:12.769
Yeah.

06:12.771 --> 06:14.003
Any one of us could be next.

06:14.005 --> 06:15.504
We're with you, Bobby!

06:15.506 --> 06:17.139
Yeah!

06:21.946 --> 06:23.512
Do you think this makes me happy, Bill?

06:23.514 --> 06:25.281
You don't need to answer that.

06:25.283 --> 06:26.581
- You happy, Bryan?
- Yeah, I'm...

06:26.583 --> 06:27.783
Right?

06:27.785 --> 06:29.985
It doesn't feel right.
It doesn't feel fair.

06:29.987 --> 06:34.455
Why you? Why are you
sitting in that chair...

06:34.457 --> 06:35.823
and not somebody else?

06:35.825 --> 06:38.293
Today...

06:38.295 --> 06:41.129
we are standing at the precipice.

06:41.131 --> 06:43.697
Today is one day after.

06:43.699 --> 06:48.402
You have one chance to avoid a cell.

06:48.404 --> 06:50.170
Give me Axelrod.

06:52.207 --> 06:55.008
The day after Pearl Harbor,

06:55.010 --> 06:57.644
everybody knew a Japanese
invasion would be coming.

06:57.646 --> 07:00.680
Air raid wardens.
Anti-aircraft artillery.

07:00.682 --> 07:02.215
Cities blacked out.

07:02.217 --> 07:04.984
Mothers and fathers staying by the door

07:04.986 --> 07:08.254
with baseball bats and kitchen knives,

07:08.256 --> 07:12.058
bellies full of fear of
the invading hordes.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.726
I know what he means to you.

07:14.728 --> 07:18.797
I know you're a loyal
man, and I admire that.

07:18.799 --> 07:22.500
But this is what you know.

07:22.502 --> 07:26.204
You know he's crooked, and
you know he's going down.

07:26.206 --> 07:28.974
But everyone was wrong.

07:28.976 --> 07:31.176
What happened on American soil next?

07:31.178 --> 07:32.577
Nothing.

07:32.579 --> 07:34.346
That's right.

07:34.348 --> 07:36.014
The invasion never came.

07:36.016 --> 07:37.148
Turned out Pearl Harbor was the best

07:37.150 --> 07:39.049
those sneak attacking
motherfuckers had.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.788
I have the men. I have the tools.

07:44.790 --> 07:47.458
I have the will.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.994
Now if it's not you,
it'll be someone else.

07:49.996 --> 07:52.429
I'll go through your
shop, one PM at a time,

07:52.431 --> 07:54.098
pick up every piece of rotten fruit

07:54.100 --> 07:56.732
and squeeze until the juice comes out.

07:56.734 --> 07:59.102
You know.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.437
You know.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.207
So you can cooperate and
walk out of here free,

08:04.209 --> 08:07.477
or you can go to jail
for no good reason.

08:09.414 --> 08:12.281
You have one chance to make this deal.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.483
A deal won't be on the table tomorrow.

08:14.485 --> 08:18.220
What came next was a war

08:18.222 --> 08:21.056
that unleashed the might of America.

08:21.058 --> 08:24.759
What came next was a
victory that left us

08:24.761 --> 08:26.961
as the most powerful nation on Earth.

08:26.963 --> 08:27.996
Fuck, yeah!

08:33.602 --> 08:36.270
No deal.

08:36.272 --> 08:39.407
This company...

08:39.409 --> 08:43.110
This company will not wait
for an uncertain future.

08:43.111 --> 08:46.147
We will make our own future!

08:46.149 --> 08:49.249
We will fight back hard.

08:49.251 --> 08:51.484
We will mobilize the war machine.

08:51.486 --> 08:53.853
And those who would try
to bring down our house

08:53.855 --> 08:55.821
will see their own houses fall!

09:10.204 --> 09:13.972
The case against my client
is entirely without merit.

09:16.410 --> 09:21.946
Bill Stearn bribed a company official

09:21.948 --> 09:24.415
in exchange for material
inside information.

09:24.417 --> 09:27.218
It does not get any clearer.

09:27.220 --> 09:31.622
He became friends with a farmer
working at a company he covers.

09:31.624 --> 09:35.159
He was so moved by the plight
of that man's daughter

09:35.161 --> 09:38.795
that he arranged transportation
and medical care for her.

09:38.797 --> 09:41.431
Now if you can convince
a jury of citizens

09:41.433 --> 09:44.434
that paying to save the
life of a sick child

09:44.436 --> 09:47.036
constitutes an illegal benefit,

09:47.038 --> 09:49.206
then you should go ahead
and take us to trial.

09:52.411 --> 09:54.844
My client has no
interest in cooperation,

09:54.846 --> 09:57.313
no interest in a plea...

10:02.820 --> 10:06.788
And he does not recognize
your authority.

10:08.993 --> 10:11.760
What the fuck does that mean?

10:14.864 --> 10:17.765
Liquidate 2% of the fund immediately.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.066
That's our war chest.

10:19.068 --> 10:22.103
$300 million. Nice rack.
Legal defense is paid for.

10:22.105 --> 10:23.704
How many billions are out the door

10:23.706 --> 10:25.039
at the first redemption?

10:25.041 --> 10:27.175
You should gate the whole damn fund

10:27.177 --> 10:28.676
before they start a run on...

10:41.123 --> 10:43.957
We're fucked.

10:43.959 --> 10:46.159
That's not the impression
you gave out there.

10:46.161 --> 10:47.527
Pretty tough talk.

10:47.529 --> 10:49.162
You think I'm overreacting?

10:49.164 --> 10:52.498
I think... open war isn't good.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.500
- For who?
- For anyone.

10:59.307 --> 11:03.142
I think your whole mentality
right now is a mistake.

11:03.144 --> 11:04.242
You're not accepting

11:04.244 --> 11:05.877
that certain things are
out of your control.

11:05.879 --> 11:07.145
Damn right I'm not.

11:07.147 --> 11:10.248
And it's causing you
to lose more control.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.617
If you wanna get it back, if you
really wanna survive this thing,

11:12.619 --> 11:15.520
then you may need to set aside
the piece of you that's...

11:15.522 --> 11:18.223
raging, and do something

11:18.225 --> 11:19.857
that makes you a little uncomfortable.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.600
- He's not gonna flip?
- No, he will,

11:29.602 --> 11:32.869
because you're gonna make it happen.
All of you.

11:32.871 --> 11:35.506
Everything you have on
him, get underneath it.

11:35.508 --> 11:37.174
Not the what... the why.

11:37.176 --> 11:40.009
What motivates him. Fears. Goals.

11:40.011 --> 11:41.444
Scars.

11:41.446 --> 11:45.215
He has a weak point, and we
need to twist a knife in it.

11:45.217 --> 11:47.383
Is there something else?

11:47.385 --> 11:49.686
We know how Axelrod's operation works.

11:49.688 --> 11:51.087
He keeps himself insulated.

11:51.089 --> 11:52.388
Is there a point you're trying to make?

11:52.390 --> 11:54.789
Some random PM at Axe Cap
isn't gonna have the goods.

11:54.791 --> 11:57.125
We need inner circle. Bill
Stearn is our best shot.

11:57.127 --> 11:59.328
Is this something you
think I don't understand?

11:59.330 --> 12:01.096
Hey, I just don't want Axe to walk away

12:01.098 --> 12:03.865
with a fine and a family
office like Birch.

12:03.867 --> 12:08.002
Is that what you think I'm doing? No.

12:08.004 --> 12:10.004
Axe is no ordinary billionaire.

12:10.006 --> 12:12.506
He's not Steven fucking Birch.

12:12.508 --> 12:15.776
He's an icon of the wealth of our age,

12:15.778 --> 12:18.346
and he is a fraud.

12:18.348 --> 12:21.682
So when he falls, he's
gonna hit the ground hard.

12:21.684 --> 12:24.619
Skilling got 14 years for Enron.
I'm gonna beat that.

12:24.621 --> 12:27.221
I just wanna take this one to
trial, let the jury decide.

12:27.223 --> 12:30.823
We're gonna put him in a cell,
and everyone is gonna see...

12:30.825 --> 12:33.993
in Washington, in the fucking press...

12:33.995 --> 12:35.562
there's no better defender
of the public trust

12:35.564 --> 12:37.163
than this office.

12:37.165 --> 12:39.165
They'll say Chuck Rhoades did that,

12:39.167 --> 12:41.501
and no one is out of his reach.

12:41.503 --> 12:45.704
You're damn skippy they will.

12:59.052 --> 13:00.286
Lara.

13:00.288 --> 13:01.853
You shouldn't be here.

13:01.855 --> 13:05.089
Come in quickly. I think
they're watching the house.

13:09.095 --> 13:11.195
They went through everything.

13:11.197 --> 13:14.064
They broke Bill's home office...
the door, in half.

13:14.066 --> 13:16.734
And I was getting the key.
Look at this.

13:16.736 --> 13:18.736
All our accounts are frozen.

13:18.738 --> 13:20.537
They didn't even wipe their feet.

13:20.539 --> 13:23.440
Sandy, stay strong, okay?

13:23.442 --> 13:25.175
It's a difficult time for everyone.

13:27.913 --> 13:31.047
You brought muffins?

13:45.363 --> 13:46.895
This is your mortgage, property tax,

13:46.897 --> 13:49.965
insurance, school tuition, and
that's for your foundation.

13:49.967 --> 13:53.668
Everything is taken care of,
for as long as this lasts.

13:53.670 --> 13:56.971
Thank you. Thank you so much.

14:08.352 --> 14:09.484
Here.

14:09.486 --> 14:11.485
Want a taste?

14:12.755 --> 14:14.388
It's like whiskey dipped
in milk chocolate.

14:15.825 --> 14:17.491
Are we celebrating something?

14:17.493 --> 14:22.095
Mm-hmm. I want to apologize.

14:22.097 --> 14:25.499
I was a big, puckered
asshole yesterday.

14:25.501 --> 14:27.734
I had no right to talk to you that way.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.802
I'll drink to that.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.215
Oh, wow.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.384
Right?

14:45.386 --> 14:49.588
Yeah, the Taiwanese do it better
than the Scots these days.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.925
How would you talk to me?

14:53.927 --> 14:57.829
If you had a do-over.

14:57.831 --> 14:59.765
What would you say?

14:59.767 --> 15:01.299
I don't want to have this fight again.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.267
Then let's not fight. Let's talk.

15:03.269 --> 15:06.103
No posturing. No bullshit.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.638
Okay.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.041
Right.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.743
What do you want to know?

15:12.745 --> 15:16.447
Why are you going after him so hard?
Why Axe?

15:16.449 --> 15:19.282
For the same reason my
office does anything.

15:19.284 --> 15:21.818
He broke the law. He cheated.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.653
Then why you?

15:23.655 --> 15:26.790
How many cases are you this
involved with personally?

15:28.427 --> 15:29.926
I don't know. Uh, four, five.

15:29.928 --> 15:31.761
Why does this have to be one of them?

15:31.763 --> 15:34.163
Why don't you recuse yourself?

15:34.165 --> 15:35.497
- Out of the question.
- Why?

15:35.499 --> 15:37.933
Because I owe it to my team.
I owe it to the public.

15:37.935 --> 15:40.001
It's my responsibility to prosecute.

15:40.003 --> 15:43.338
It doesn't have to be you.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.973
Give the case to Bryan Connerty alone,

15:44.975 --> 15:46.875
or the Eastern District.

15:46.877 --> 15:50.412
This case?

15:50.414 --> 15:54.148
SEC, Eastern, uh, State AG...

15:54.150 --> 15:58.319
they have been whispering about
Axelrod for years, waiting.

15:58.321 --> 15:59.821
I'm the one that stood up.

15:59.823 --> 16:01.823
I'm the only one that did something.

16:01.825 --> 16:04.158
This is an action against me.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.526
Do you understand?

16:05.528 --> 16:09.129
Do you? Because this
is bigger than you.

16:09.131 --> 16:10.630
It's bigger than me.

16:10.632 --> 16:13.934
He runs more money than the
GDP of a European nation.

16:13.936 --> 16:17.671
He's untouchable, and I
have him dead to rights.

16:17.673 --> 16:19.773
You may think you do, but you don't.

16:19.775 --> 16:21.958
Really? What makes you so sure?

16:22.043 --> 16:23.843
Because...

16:24.045 --> 16:25.411
I have never seen him like this.

16:25.413 --> 16:28.481
He is digging trenches and laying wire,

16:28.483 --> 16:30.950
and he will scorch the
earth under our feet.

16:30.952 --> 16:32.317
Tell me more about what he's doing.

16:32.319 --> 16:33.619
I can't go further.

16:33.621 --> 16:36.655
And it's wrong of you to push.
I took an oath.

16:36.657 --> 16:40.058
Me, too. And that's why
I can't recuse myself.

16:40.060 --> 16:42.294
Yes, you can.

16:42.296 --> 16:43.495
You just won't.

16:55.942 --> 16:58.376
Ahh.

17:30.642 --> 17:33.509
We've gone down this road,
backwards and sideways.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.176
Now we gotta do it on
our hands and knees.

17:35.178 --> 17:36.411
That's a fun image.

17:36.413 --> 17:37.846
I don't even know what
we're looking for anymore.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.415
He's gotta be hiding something.

17:40.417 --> 17:43.018
I've never seen anybody
so clean in his world.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.118
Ah, except for, you know,

17:44.120 --> 17:45.654
the bribery and securities fraud.

17:45.656 --> 17:47.288
Ah, he might not think it's illegal.

17:47.290 --> 17:50.391
He might be right. The courts
keep moving the goalposts.

17:50.393 --> 17:51.526
Yeah, I know what they tell themselves.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.028
I've been to those
Sohn conferences, too.

17:54.030 --> 17:57.164
"Capitalism is under siege."

17:57.166 --> 18:01.035
All those guys think if you can't
prove they did the murder,

18:01.037 --> 18:02.903
then they're not a killer.

18:02.905 --> 18:05.105
Don't fucking kid yourself.

18:05.107 --> 18:07.207
They're only players 'cause
they rigged the game.

18:07.209 --> 18:08.308
Of course.

18:10.812 --> 18:12.845
Huh?

18:14.716 --> 18:17.050
Hmm? That's all I got.

18:18.086 --> 18:20.086
Greedy or cheap, it's a fine line.

18:20.088 --> 18:21.821
What are his greatest hits, Terri?

18:21.823 --> 18:26.291
Uh, reusing paper towels. $1
taco night at Acapulco's.

18:26.293 --> 18:28.359
No Benz, no Audi.

18:28.361 --> 18:31.396
Just two identical Honda minivans.

18:31.398 --> 18:33.498
Who the fuck has two minivans?

18:33.500 --> 18:36.167
- One in beige, one in...
- boring.

18:36.169 --> 18:38.436
Nobody.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.673
Nobody has two minivans. That's it.

18:42.675 --> 18:44.341
There's something there, and
we need to find out what.

18:45.745 --> 18:49.480
We're gonna bleed out.

18:49.482 --> 18:51.115
We'll be a family office
by the end of the year,

18:51.117 --> 18:52.617
by SEC mandate or not.

18:52.619 --> 18:53.918
We need to take action.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.452
We need to cut through the chatter.

18:55.454 --> 18:56.754
We need to get it out there...

18:56.756 --> 18:58.956
Rhoades has no case, he'll
be laughed out of court.

18:58.958 --> 19:00.556
You know that doesn't matter.

19:00.558 --> 19:02.125
The smoke is enough to choke you.

19:02.127 --> 19:03.426
There doesn't need to be a fire.

19:03.428 --> 19:04.527
I don't accept that.

19:04.529 --> 19:07.430
Why not embrace this?

19:07.432 --> 19:09.866
We'll be a killer family office.

19:09.868 --> 19:11.935
We can downsize the staff.

19:11.937 --> 19:13.703
I can't stand half the
people here anyway.

19:13.705 --> 19:17.506
Never. I need outside capital.

19:19.010 --> 19:20.909
Why?

19:20.911 --> 19:22.845
You have billions in assets to invest

19:22.847 --> 19:24.913
without a penny of outside money,

19:24.915 --> 19:26.915
and no one to answer to.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.617
I'll be dead to the world.

19:28.619 --> 19:30.552
I'll be called a cheat. Humiliated.

19:30.554 --> 19:33.155
Another rich dick playing the
market with his own money.

19:33.157 --> 19:36.290
But you'll be the biggest dick.
And it's so much money.

19:36.292 --> 19:38.159
Wags...

19:40.563 --> 19:42.429
What we need is a public endorsement,

19:42.431 --> 19:45.767
from the prime brokers...
D-Bank, Citi, JP.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.869
- All of them?
- No. There's only one

19:47.871 --> 19:50.171
that matters... Spartan-Ives.

19:52.908 --> 19:55.308
What would you want
Lawrence Boyd to say?

19:55.310 --> 19:58.045
That he believes Axe Capital
to be a reputable company,

19:58.047 --> 20:00.213
and we're gonna continue
to do business together.

20:00.215 --> 20:03.316
Yeah, that's never gonna happen.

20:03.318 --> 20:04.751
Make it happen.

20:09.857 --> 20:12.992
What about a dog whistle?

20:12.994 --> 20:14.593
They're seen together, photographed,

20:14.595 --> 20:16.395
Boyd's arm around you at the Met.

20:16.397 --> 20:17.963
No, not fancy.

20:17.965 --> 20:22.267
A game, at the Stadium or
at his box at Barclays.

20:22.269 --> 20:25.536
Boyd's touch is the healing
waters of Lourdes.

20:25.538 --> 20:27.005
Cleaner than a maiden's honor.

20:27.007 --> 20:28.807
Get me in those waters.

20:28.809 --> 20:31.375
Both minivans registered to Bill Stearn

20:31.377 --> 20:33.377
under the same group insurance policy.

20:33.379 --> 20:34.545
But one of 'em...

20:34.547 --> 20:35.980
EZ Pass records track
it all over New Jersey,

20:35.982 --> 20:37.315
never Connecticut.

20:37.317 --> 20:39.984
Speeding ticket from 2013 led
to the Saddle River address.

20:39.986 --> 20:43.253
You went there? This is for real?

20:43.255 --> 20:45.022
We've fucking got him.

20:54.867 --> 20:57.801
601 Tanbark Trail.

20:57.803 --> 20:59.568
That supposed to mean something?

20:59.570 --> 21:01.704
How many days a week do
you stay over there?

21:01.706 --> 21:04.340
I'm guessing 3.5. He's very meticulous.

21:04.342 --> 21:06.008
I try to be fair.

21:06.010 --> 21:07.476
He tell you?

21:07.478 --> 21:09.846
Bill Stearn has a second family.

21:09.848 --> 21:11.914
Two kids with a mistress in
Saddle River, New Jersey.

21:11.916 --> 21:13.315
He's a family man.

21:13.317 --> 21:15.651
I wanna know how the
hell you have the time

21:15.653 --> 21:17.452
to bribe farmers,
manipulate the market,

21:17.454 --> 21:19.955
and coach two travel baseball teams?

21:19.957 --> 21:21.857
Timmy's in the spring,
Carson's in the fall.

21:21.859 --> 21:23.458
I try to be fair.

21:23.460 --> 21:28.830
I want to know, how would Sandy
react if she heard this?

21:28.832 --> 21:33.167
She must be very fragile these
days since your arrest.

21:36.873 --> 21:39.339
Getting the photo
stream in her in-box...

21:39.341 --> 21:44.311
all those happy pictures of
you and Carson and Anna...

21:44.313 --> 21:48.816
with a woman ten years
younger than her...

21:48.818 --> 21:50.683
Well, that might just break her.

21:58.559 --> 22:00.960
I knew you'd come with that.

22:02.497 --> 22:05.932
I wrote a letter to my
wife, the whole story.

22:10.504 --> 22:12.504
I just sent it.

22:14.275 --> 22:15.573
Uh...

22:15.575 --> 22:20.345
You just blew up your family...

22:20.347 --> 22:22.547
for Bobby Axelrod?

22:22.549 --> 22:25.549
I'm Keyser Soze, motherfucker.

22:32.625 --> 22:36.627
Ohh.

22:36.629 --> 22:38.796
Worst part of these sessions.

22:38.798 --> 22:41.164
I've got a small bladder.

22:42.935 --> 22:44.134
What is it with these guys?

22:44.136 --> 22:47.037
What... what is it about
the cult of Bobby Axelrod

22:47.039 --> 22:50.006
that makes them wanna
immolate themselves?

22:50.208 --> 22:52.575
You wouldn't understand.

22:52.577 --> 22:54.444
You're a lawyer. Persuade me.

22:55.948 --> 22:57.380
You're at the mercy of politics.

22:57.382 --> 22:59.581
Loyalty is a convenience.

22:59.583 --> 23:02.251
People turn on each other
every election cycle.

23:02.253 --> 23:05.721
You do your three or
five or ten years here,

23:05.723 --> 23:08.457
then you flip to our
side, cash seven figures

23:08.459 --> 23:11.293
from the same big funds
you're trying to bring down.

23:11.295 --> 23:13.595
For true believers like you,

23:13.597 --> 23:16.898
it's the worst 'cause you
never see it coming.

23:18.902 --> 23:21.135
That's the problem with being a cynic.
It blinds you.

23:21.137 --> 23:23.872
You think everybody's
as cynical as you.

23:23.874 --> 23:27.675
Axe's guys, they're in it for life.

23:27.677 --> 23:29.177
Bill Stearn couldn't
walk down the street

23:29.179 --> 23:30.979
if he sold out his friends.

23:30.981 --> 23:35.582
Guys who talk in their world may
avoid a few years in a cell,

23:35.584 --> 23:39.019
but they're dead forever.

23:39.021 --> 23:41.321
See you soon, I guess...

23:41.323 --> 23:44.824
when Chuck comes at Axe
with some lame fine,

23:44.826 --> 23:48.428
because obviously you've got nothing.

23:50.464 --> 23:52.431
No, not this time.

23:52.433 --> 23:53.565
Not Axe.

23:53.567 --> 23:55.301
This is personal for Chuck.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.403
The whole city puts
your boy on a pedestal.

23:57.405 --> 23:59.171
But he doesn't... he
doesn't make anything.

23:59.173 --> 24:00.806
He doesn't do anything.

24:00.808 --> 24:04.443
He's nothing but a filthy money pig.

24:04.445 --> 24:05.878
And I can see why he'd
wanna make a deal,

24:05.880 --> 24:08.579
because he knows we're coming,

24:08.581 --> 24:10.248
and we will follow him till
the end of the fucking Earth

24:10.250 --> 24:13.251
until he's walking in shackles.

24:13.253 --> 24:15.720
You know you just work here, right?

24:23.362 --> 24:25.963
- Lara, hi.
- Hi.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.331
How is everything?

24:27.333 --> 24:29.233
- Great.
- Good.

24:29.235 --> 24:30.867
Yeah, you know, we should get the
kids together this Saturday.

24:30.869 --> 24:33.503
Sure, at the Bancroft twins' party.

24:33.505 --> 24:35.005
Right. Party.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.340
In Montauk.

24:36.342 --> 24:39.676
Yes, of course. I forgot
it was this weekend.

24:39.678 --> 24:40.910
- Right.
- I'll see you there.

24:40.912 --> 24:42.312
All right, I'll see you there.

24:49.054 --> 24:51.087
Hey, take it easy!

24:51.089 --> 24:54.790
You're at 120 feet per minute.
You're gonna blow an Achilles!

24:54.792 --> 24:56.559
Aah!

24:57.995 --> 24:59.727
What's wrong?

24:59.729 --> 25:01.729
I'll be right back.

25:07.504 --> 25:09.737
Hey, I'm not getting
anywhere with Lawrence Boyd.

25:09.739 --> 25:12.207
- The problem is...
- Solve it.

25:12.209 --> 25:14.976
All those years of thought
and planning and calculation

25:14.978 --> 25:16.610
that you and he put in are for nothing,

25:16.612 --> 25:18.846
and there's a high probability
that it does go wrong.

25:18.848 --> 25:23.017
So it's in both your interests to...

25:23.019 --> 25:24.285
I'll have to call you back.

25:34.363 --> 25:37.397
You took $250,000 out of the fund.

25:37.399 --> 25:39.599
Why does it bother you? I
still have $3 million in.

25:39.601 --> 25:41.001
Why'd you take it out?

25:41.003 --> 25:45.138
It's my money. I can do
whatever I want with it.

25:45.140 --> 25:46.839
Or can't I?

25:46.841 --> 25:50.142
Dollar Bill earned a $10
million bonus last year.

25:50.144 --> 25:52.878
You know how much he took out? 2 grand.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.513
You've known about this for weeks.

25:54.515 --> 25:55.914
You're bringing it up now because

25:55.916 --> 25:57.682
you wanna know something.
What is it you wanna know?

25:57.684 --> 25:59.951
Why don't you take it all out?

26:03.757 --> 26:05.756
I am not my husband.

26:05.758 --> 26:07.825
And I am not going to
be the shuttlecock

26:07.827 --> 26:11.762
that you two smack back and forth.

26:15.168 --> 26:16.501
You two just sniffed each other one day

26:16.503 --> 26:18.469
and decided you didn't like the smell.

26:18.471 --> 26:22.939
So now you think you have to
do this thing, but you don't.

26:22.941 --> 26:25.808
You don't have to do it.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.233
Dollar Bill is hard, man.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.069
Inspiring.

26:53.071 --> 26:55.237
He makes me wanna lose 30 pounds

26:55.239 --> 27:00.007
and stockpile automatic weapons
to protect all my sister-wives.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.642
Will he be exonerated?

27:01.644 --> 27:03.445
It's the government.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.012
If he is, it'll be in five years,

27:05.014 --> 27:08.550
and no one will remember it.

27:08.552 --> 27:10.351
Look...

27:10.353 --> 27:11.986
just because he's not cooperating

27:11.988 --> 27:14.188
doesn't mean they can't
tie you to Pepsum,

27:14.190 --> 27:18.092
doesn't mean they can't get
you on something else.

27:18.094 --> 27:21.462
But we have an opportunity
now to broach a deal.

27:21.464 --> 27:22.596
I'll never settle.

27:22.598 --> 27:27.267
No. Now's the time you drop that.

27:27.269 --> 27:30.669
Chuck's guy, Connerty...

27:30.671 --> 27:32.871
he's rattled.

27:32.873 --> 27:34.540
They're weak.

27:34.542 --> 27:36.008
And I think we could get a deal

27:36.010 --> 27:38.511
that would be very, very good for you.

27:38.513 --> 27:41.981
Look, guys try to sell
me deals all day.

27:41.983 --> 27:43.249
I decide when they're good.

27:43.251 --> 27:45.318
The one I bring you
will be the best one

27:45.320 --> 27:48.086
that'll ever on the table,

27:48.088 --> 27:50.255
'cause that's what I do all day.

27:50.257 --> 27:52.857
I see that.

27:52.859 --> 27:55.660
And it won't really
hurt you, grand scheme,

27:55.662 --> 27:57.662
other than emotionally.

27:57.664 --> 28:00.132
It'll seem like a win
to them, and they stop.

28:00.134 --> 28:03.935
Give them more time, who
knows what they'll find?

28:06.071 --> 28:07.938
I didn't do anything

28:07.940 --> 28:10.741
that anybody else in my
business doesn't do.

28:10.743 --> 28:12.276
I just did it better.

28:12.278 --> 28:14.245
And I will not tar myself
with an admission of guilt

28:14.247 --> 28:15.746
- over some...
- You wouldn't plead guilty.

28:15.748 --> 28:20.817
Any success that his bullshit
investigation yields is toxic.

28:20.819 --> 28:25.488
He cannot just walk around
using rumor and hearsay

28:25.490 --> 28:27.323
and destroy lives and businesses.

28:27.325 --> 28:30.660
I won't allow it. That
needs to be the message.

28:30.662 --> 28:32.529
He's got nothing.

28:32.531 --> 28:33.663
Billionaires all over the world

28:33.665 --> 28:35.064
are trying to bring me down every day.

28:35.066 --> 28:36.999
This guy? He can't even
bring me to trial.

28:37.001 --> 28:39.268
He has failed at his job.

28:39.270 --> 28:40.902
Why the hell would I give him a win?

28:40.904 --> 28:45.674
What win? It's your win.

28:45.676 --> 28:47.442
You go free.

28:47.444 --> 28:49.077
You pay a fine,

28:49.079 --> 28:51.746
get busted down to a family office.

28:51.748 --> 28:54.983
That's nothing. It's headed
that way anyway, isn't it?

28:54.985 --> 28:56.184
No!

29:01.057 --> 29:03.191
Adam.

29:03.193 --> 29:05.125
What brings you to our fair city, sir?

29:05.127 --> 29:06.960
I'm giving the commencement
at Columbia Law.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.930
Ah. I gave that speech two years ago.

29:09.932 --> 29:11.599
You need some tips?

29:11.601 --> 29:15.468
Hey, congrats on getting Steve Birch.

29:15.470 --> 29:18.171
That's a solid double.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.972
Axelrod...

29:19.974 --> 29:21.174
that's bigger.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.709
You speaking for the Attorney General

29:22.711 --> 29:24.043
or is this off the cuff?

29:24.045 --> 29:25.978
I speak for everyone.

29:25.980 --> 29:27.414
It's fundraising season.

29:27.416 --> 29:29.182
The administration needs Wall
Street money to compete.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.650
Nobody wants this to look
like some kind of crusade.

29:31.652 --> 29:32.784
I'm doing my job.

29:32.786 --> 29:34.453
I don't think about what it looks like.

29:34.455 --> 29:36.121
Well, the AG does.

29:36.123 --> 29:37.456
I see.

29:37.458 --> 29:38.724
We feel... or she feels...

29:38.726 --> 29:40.526
that your investigation is problematic,

29:40.528 --> 29:42.595
given your personal
connection to Axe Capital.

29:42.597 --> 29:44.396
I mean, the optics are bad.
That article...

29:44.398 --> 29:46.931
Has no basis in fact.

29:46.933 --> 29:50.468
The idea, the very concept that
I would be soft on Axe Capital

29:50.470 --> 29:51.769
because my wife works there,

29:51.771 --> 29:53.371
I'm going to erase that
very, very quickly.

29:53.373 --> 29:55.106
I have. An arrest was made.

29:55.108 --> 29:58.075
Okay, so maybe you targeted
Axelrod because she works there,

29:58.077 --> 30:00.077
which is fucked up.

30:00.079 --> 30:01.812
First, I'm too soft. Now I'm too tough.

30:01.814 --> 30:04.147
Uh, which is it, Goldilocks?

30:04.149 --> 30:07.351
Both. Either. I don't care. The
point is, she works there.

30:07.353 --> 30:08.685
That's what they're
gonna be writing about.

30:08.687 --> 30:09.986
And Axelrod will be paying an
army of white-shoe lawyers

30:09.988 --> 30:11.755
$1,000 an hour...

30:11.757 --> 30:12.889
...to come up with a
thousand different ways

30:12.891 --> 30:14.391
to yell "conflict of interest."

30:14.393 --> 30:16.192
This is my office.

30:16.194 --> 30:18.462
I have broad discretion
to pursue any actions

30:18.464 --> 30:20.096
exactly the way I see fit.

30:20.098 --> 30:22.398
Of course. The AG doesn't
care about one case.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.032
She's thinking globally here.

30:24.034 --> 30:26.702
She's into movements, like a maestro.

30:26.704 --> 30:28.904
But a lost case is still a wrong note.

30:28.906 --> 30:31.274
I've never lost a case.

30:31.276 --> 30:33.476
And I'm sure you won't lose this one.

30:33.478 --> 30:35.043
if that conviction
gets kicked on appeal

30:35.045 --> 30:37.412
because you didn't
recuse yourself, well...

30:37.414 --> 30:38.680
even if you win, you lose.

30:38.682 --> 30:40.014
Does the Attorney General
want me removed?

30:40.016 --> 30:41.816
She just wants you to be right.

30:41.818 --> 30:44.619
You do what you're gonna do, Chuck.
Just be right.

30:44.621 --> 30:45.787
I gotta grab this.

30:45.789 --> 30:48.423
Yes?

30:48.425 --> 30:49.857
Fucking maestro.

30:55.831 --> 30:58.231
Get ready to head to Brooklyn.

30:58.233 --> 30:59.900
Tonight's the night of your baptism

30:59.902 --> 31:02.403
at the church of Barclays.

31:02.405 --> 31:05.238
Lawrence Boyd has
invited you to his box.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.741
Washed in the blood of the lamb, baby.

31:07.743 --> 31:08.842
How'd it go down?

31:08.844 --> 31:10.177
Uh, maitre d' at a place I go

31:10.179 --> 31:12.144
had $1,000 on him to tell
me when Boyd came in.

31:12.146 --> 31:16.081
Sent over a '61 Château Latour
and picked up his dinner,

31:16.083 --> 31:17.517
courtesy of Bobby Axelrod.

31:17.519 --> 31:19.885
- Well played.
- I have my moments.

31:30.331 --> 31:33.365
How you holding up?

31:33.367 --> 31:35.567
My lawyer today told me they
don't have a case against me,

31:35.569 --> 31:37.569
but I should still settle.

31:37.571 --> 31:38.770
Can you believe that?

31:39.873 --> 31:42.173
Yeah.

31:42.175 --> 31:43.342
I'm guessing you don't mean that

31:43.344 --> 31:44.676
in a "fucking lawyers" kind of way.

31:44.678 --> 31:47.545
I think you have the
best fucking lawyers.

31:47.547 --> 31:49.947
They know the law like
you know the market.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.315
And if they're giving
you a piece of advice,

31:51.317 --> 31:52.950
I think you should consider it.

31:52.952 --> 31:56.220
Wow. How does Chuck Rhoades
terrify everybody so much?

31:56.222 --> 31:58.622
I don't give a shit
about Chuck Rhoades.

31:58.624 --> 32:02.259
I care about protecting this family.

32:02.261 --> 32:04.594
We're gonna be pariahs.

32:04.596 --> 32:07.196
The kids got uninvited
to the Bancroft party,

32:07.198 --> 32:10.066
and nothing's even happened yet.

32:10.068 --> 32:13.169
So if there is even close
to an easy way out of this,

32:13.171 --> 32:14.504
I hope you would take it.

32:14.506 --> 32:16.038
Since when do I take the easy way out?

32:16.040 --> 32:18.107
This isn't some stock play.

32:18.109 --> 32:19.742
It's no different.

32:19.744 --> 32:22.177
It's all about tolerance and risk.

32:22.179 --> 32:24.513
Look, you don't win, you
don't get to where I am

32:24.515 --> 32:26.648
without tolerating a lot of risk.

32:26.650 --> 32:29.651
We. Where we are.

32:29.653 --> 32:32.488
This is real, Bobby.
You're risking our lives.

32:32.490 --> 32:34.790
You could go to jail. We
could lose everything.

32:34.792 --> 32:36.824
And you can make it all
go away and you won't?

32:36.826 --> 32:38.593
I can't. Not like that.

32:38.595 --> 32:39.827
Why not?

32:39.829 --> 32:41.529
Because I don't get on bended knee

32:41.531 --> 32:43.097
and pledge fealty to the king.

32:43.099 --> 32:45.165
It's not who I am. It's
not who you married.

32:45.167 --> 32:47.402
Well, that's just fucking stupid.

32:47.404 --> 32:49.837
The ground is shifting, and
you don't even see it.

32:49.839 --> 32:51.739
Or you refuse to see it.

32:51.741 --> 32:53.673
But if this were some stock play,

32:53.675 --> 32:55.208
it wouldn't be about pride.

32:55.210 --> 32:57.076
You'd have already cut your losses.

32:57.078 --> 32:59.613
Lara, the ground is shifting
because I'm the one moving it.

32:59.615 --> 33:02.582
Lawrence Boyd invited
me to his box today.

33:02.584 --> 33:04.851
That tells the Street, tells the world,

33:04.853 --> 33:07.421
that my stock, our
stock, is about to rally

33:07.423 --> 33:09.656
because Spartan-Ives
does not back a loser.

33:16.764 --> 33:19.164
I gotta go to work.

33:24.038 --> 33:27.205
I know for a fact Garth
Sykes is dumping Axe.

33:27.207 --> 33:29.741
- Mm.
- Moving over to Vista Verde.

33:29.743 --> 33:34.312
So there is blood in the water.
It's a thing of beauty.

33:34.314 --> 33:36.314
I guess the invisible
hand of the market

33:36.316 --> 33:38.416
is, uh, pushing him off a cliff.

33:38.418 --> 33:41.252
I would kill for a window

33:41.254 --> 33:43.855
into the panic flowing
through that place.

33:43.857 --> 33:45.489
Charles, be sensitive.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.090
Axe must take three sessions

33:47.092 --> 33:49.326
just to make it through a day, huh?

33:49.328 --> 33:51.495
Ugh. They're Neanderthals.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.698
It's the hormones. It makes
their brains seem small.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.801
It's all right, Ellen.
It is a difficult time.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.471
And it's going to get worse
before it gets better.

34:05.443 --> 34:08.478
I don't understand why you
can't smoke in the house.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.112
I don't smoke.

34:10.114 --> 34:13.382
You're not allowed to, you mean?

34:14.652 --> 34:17.487
I pretty much do what I want.

34:18.755 --> 34:20.489
Maybe not as much as you.

34:22.292 --> 34:25.726
Mm.

34:30.367 --> 34:32.801
Getting him to take the plea deal...

34:32.803 --> 34:35.469
that's the trick.

34:35.472 --> 34:38.138
A big settlement that'll hurt him,

34:38.139 --> 34:39.607
get him off of outside money.

34:39.609 --> 34:41.440
What makes you think I would settle?

34:41.443 --> 34:43.610
My desktop calendar.

34:43.612 --> 34:46.079
A conviction could take years.

34:46.081 --> 34:48.447
You don't want it to be your
successor that gets the credit.

34:48.449 --> 34:52.952
No, I'll be on the podium for this.

34:52.954 --> 34:57.557
Son, has your vision
of the future changed?

34:57.559 --> 34:59.826
Or is it just my vision?

34:59.828 --> 35:02.929
Because after... after that
short squeeze incident...

35:02.931 --> 35:05.264
and I understand that I put
you in a bad position.

35:05.266 --> 35:06.566
I understand that.

35:07.769 --> 35:11.570
Your performance left me
more convinced than ever

35:11.572 --> 35:13.939
of your greatness.

35:13.941 --> 35:18.577
There is no high office in the
land you could not attain.

35:18.579 --> 35:21.680
- Okay, Dad, I appreciate...
- But if you want that,

35:21.682 --> 35:25.383
you have to think about
things in a certain way.

35:25.385 --> 35:29.053
I didn't when I was
younger, and it cost me.

35:29.055 --> 35:31.656
You can't allow yourself

35:31.658 --> 35:35.826
to get drawn in to an unwinnable fight.

35:35.828 --> 35:38.395
And I won't.

35:38.397 --> 35:41.098
Victory will be swift, Dad.

35:41.100 --> 35:45.201
No. Be realistic.

35:45.203 --> 35:47.437
This guy is gearing up...

35:47.439 --> 35:49.172
...for trench warfare.

35:55.547 --> 35:57.647
You've been talking to
Wendy, haven't you?

36:00.518 --> 36:03.118
Well, you're the one
who's always telling me

36:03.120 --> 36:06.521
that she has your best
interests at heart.

36:15.532 --> 36:17.532
What the hell was that?

36:17.534 --> 36:20.434
You've twisted my father into
carrying your water now?

36:20.436 --> 36:23.537
He called. I told him what I think.

36:23.539 --> 36:25.106
He agreed with me.

36:25.108 --> 36:28.209
That I should settle, huh?

36:30.981 --> 36:33.014
Nice try.

36:33.016 --> 36:36.149
You want me to think that, uh,
you're trying to save your job?

36:36.151 --> 36:37.784
Really, you're trying to save Axelrod.

36:37.786 --> 36:40.787
I am trying to save you

36:40.789 --> 36:42.723
and me and him...

36:42.725 --> 36:44.791
- and your father.

36:47.229 --> 36:49.496
Do you trust me?

36:52.266 --> 36:53.866
Just because I trust you

36:53.868 --> 36:57.637
doesn't mean I think you're right.

36:57.639 --> 37:01.373
Ask me anything.

37:01.375 --> 37:03.943
Are you gonna open up
the book on Axe for me?

37:03.945 --> 37:05.544
The whole way?

37:05.546 --> 37:09.047
- What about the oath?
- What do you want to know?

37:09.049 --> 37:10.414
What's he thinking right now?
What's he doing?

37:10.416 --> 37:12.684
He's looking for a win.

37:12.686 --> 37:15.887
Always. He needs to find
at least a small win

37:15.889 --> 37:18.256
in every endeavor, every exchange.

37:18.258 --> 37:19.791
What happens if he can't find one?

37:19.793 --> 37:21.926
Then he'll play a different game,

37:21.928 --> 37:23.327
with different rules...
ones you don't know,

37:23.329 --> 37:25.996
no one knows, where...

37:25.998 --> 37:28.899
he can make your loss
bigger than his loss.

37:28.901 --> 37:32.069
A lose-lose scenario. And
that doesn't bother him?

37:32.071 --> 37:34.838
Of course it does, but
Axe came from nothing.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.606
So unconsciously, he fears...

37:36.608 --> 37:41.779
No, he may even expect
he'll have nothing again.

37:41.781 --> 37:44.413
So he...

37:44.415 --> 37:50.486
loves to put that same
fear into others,

37:50.488 --> 37:52.521
especially if they're
not familiar with it.

38:00.164 --> 38:02.764
Like the Eads family.

38:02.766 --> 38:04.666
The naming rights? I heard about that.

38:04.668 --> 38:07.936
But that's just the
part of him I know...

38:07.938 --> 38:10.538
that he's allowed me to see.

38:10.540 --> 38:12.808
But you know him better than anybody.

38:12.810 --> 38:16.277
Well, I think I do, but I'm
not really sure anyone can.

38:20.616 --> 38:22.750
He's most likely ahead of you...

38:24.687 --> 38:26.520
Especially when it looks like he's not.

38:26.522 --> 38:29.523
And if he does go down, he
will pull you down with him.

38:29.525 --> 38:31.291
I'm not afraid to prosecute anybody.

38:31.293 --> 38:32.893
Okay, it's not about that.

38:32.895 --> 38:34.660
It's about you being your alpha self,

38:34.662 --> 38:36.362
not letting him pull
you out of your game.

38:36.364 --> 38:38.932
That's his goal in all his deals...

38:38.934 --> 38:41.567
get under their skin, get
them to make a mistake.

38:43.905 --> 38:47.907
If this was a different
case, uh, at this stage,

38:47.909 --> 38:50.809
I would pursue a plea agreement.

38:50.811 --> 38:53.078
You would.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.047
It's a cardinal rule... you
don't trust your career

38:55.049 --> 38:59.084
in the hands of a jury of
12 random crazy people

38:59.086 --> 39:01.519
who might decide a case
based on a wink and a smile

39:01.521 --> 39:04.156
and not the law,

39:04.158 --> 39:06.558
which they can't fucking
understand in the first place.

39:10.463 --> 39:12.663
Would he take a deal?

39:12.665 --> 39:15.199
He'd settle if he thought it was a win.

39:15.201 --> 39:17.268
If he thought he tricked
you, even better.

39:17.270 --> 39:18.903
The only deal with teeth

39:18.905 --> 39:21.239
would have to take him
out of business forever.

39:21.241 --> 39:22.974
That's the only deal
he would never take.

39:22.976 --> 39:26.542
Would he take a family office?
Would he admit guilt?

39:26.544 --> 39:28.078
Why don't you ask his lawyer?

39:28.080 --> 39:31.314
No, they have to come to me.

39:31.316 --> 39:36.319
If they come to me,
then it's on my terms.

39:36.321 --> 39:39.956
I can get him to come to you.

39:39.958 --> 39:42.624
Are you sure?

39:42.626 --> 39:43.793
I mean...

39:43.795 --> 39:46.796
what if the Axe we're
dealing with now...

39:46.798 --> 39:49.298
What if that's the part of
him you don't know about?

40:07.884 --> 40:09.918
What happened?

40:09.920 --> 40:12.954
Well, Lawrence Boyd
sent me the message.

40:12.956 --> 40:15.956
He pissed right in my face.

40:22.031 --> 40:24.832
Holy shit. Bobby Axelrod!

40:24.834 --> 40:27.234
Can I get a selfie? I'll get
mad followers on my Instagram.

40:27.236 --> 40:28.969
He didn't show.

40:28.971 --> 40:32.639
The room was full of
20-year-old dipshits.

40:32.641 --> 40:34.173
It was mailroom night.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.413
Well, what the hell do we do now?

40:43.584 --> 40:44.717
It's worse than I thought.

40:44.719 --> 40:46.552
That's why we're standing here.

40:46.554 --> 40:48.520
I didn't think it would go like this,

40:48.522 --> 40:52.257
this fast.

40:52.259 --> 40:53.291
What's the counter?

40:53.293 --> 40:54.759
It's easy.

40:54.761 --> 40:58.363
Rhoades is vulnerable, exposed.

40:58.365 --> 41:01.799
Conflict of interest.

41:01.801 --> 41:03.201
Wendy.

41:03.203 --> 41:06.571
I make it look like she's involved.

41:06.573 --> 41:09.139
Fraud, embezzlement.

41:09.141 --> 41:10.574
Or maybe she's having an affair...

41:10.576 --> 41:14.245
with Bill Stearn.

41:14.247 --> 41:16.981
With you, even.

41:16.983 --> 41:19.884
Watch how fast the case goes away.

41:21.754 --> 41:24.120
I'll let you know.

41:29.094 --> 41:31.127
He's working out of the office today.

41:31.129 --> 41:32.661
Will you tell him I need to talk?

41:32.663 --> 41:34.663
In person. It's important.

41:34.665 --> 41:37.633
Of course.

41:37.635 --> 41:39.168
You're gonna give him a deal?

41:39.170 --> 41:40.870
You're gonna fucking let him walk?

41:40.872 --> 41:43.505
If Axelrod comes to the table,
we'll see what we can get.

41:43.507 --> 41:44.839
It's the smart way to go.

41:44.841 --> 41:48.043
That's not what you said two days ago.
What happened?

41:48.045 --> 41:50.379
I changed my mind.

41:50.381 --> 41:54.116
Y... Ah, this is fucking
Birch all over again.

41:54.118 --> 41:56.584
I didn't come here and
sacrifice real money

41:56.586 --> 41:57.719
to let these guys write

41:57.721 --> 41:59.520
their own "get out of jail free" cards.

41:59.522 --> 42:02.223
Was it... Is that all just
bullshit posturing? Why?!

42:02.225 --> 42:03.958
Because you don't have him!

42:06.495 --> 42:07.995
Give me more time.

42:09.465 --> 42:12.666
And I will build this case
into a fucking guillotine

42:12.668 --> 42:14.035
and drop the blade.

42:14.037 --> 42:15.635
It's too late. We went into his house

42:15.637 --> 42:20.340
and, uh... we shit the bed.

42:20.342 --> 42:22.976
Every day I don't bring
charges, we lose leverage,

42:22.978 --> 42:24.477
and the deal gets better for him.

42:24.479 --> 42:26.980
So, uh, take the rest of the day off.

42:26.982 --> 42:28.648
Or better yet, wait by the phone

42:28.650 --> 42:32.117
for his people to reach out.

42:41.628 --> 42:42.894
Hello, Wendy.

42:46.167 --> 42:47.566
Have we met?

42:47.568 --> 42:51.002
No. And we still haven't.

42:51.004 --> 42:54.138
If you wanna talk to him, get in.

42:57.577 --> 42:58.709
Where are we going?

43:20.032 --> 43:22.799
We have to take precautions.

43:22.801 --> 43:25.201
There's a protocol.

43:38.149 --> 43:41.349
It's been a weird couple of days.

43:41.351 --> 43:43.551
Yeah.

43:43.553 --> 43:46.687
It's hard to be sure about anything...

43:46.689 --> 43:48.289
anyone.

43:48.291 --> 43:51.292
I understand.

43:51.294 --> 43:55.730
I need to understand something, too.

43:55.732 --> 43:59.033
That's why we're sitting
here like this.

43:59.035 --> 44:00.367
No one listening but us.

44:03.906 --> 44:07.974
Have I won your trust?

44:07.976 --> 44:10.110
What do you want to understand?

44:10.112 --> 44:13.980
Why are you sticking around?

44:17.985 --> 44:20.853
I am interested in what
that question means to you.

44:20.855 --> 44:22.788
I wanna know...

44:22.790 --> 44:27.893
No, I know, I... you just
wanna hear my answer.

44:27.895 --> 44:32.397
I'm not gonna tell you I'm
staying because you need me.

44:32.399 --> 44:35.467
Even though you do, more than ever.

44:35.469 --> 44:37.436
And I'm not gonna tell you
I'm here for my patients

44:37.438 --> 44:41.005
or because I love my job,
even though I do love my job.

44:41.007 --> 44:44.943
And your collection of
insecure egomaniacs

44:44.945 --> 44:46.445
would lose a billion a year

44:46.447 --> 44:49.113
if I didn't keep their heads straight.

44:49.115 --> 44:53.417
And I am not going to tell you
I'm here spying for Chuck,

44:53.419 --> 44:57.788
Because you know that's
total fucking nonsense.

45:01.461 --> 45:02.726
The answer...

45:05.163 --> 45:09.566
My answer is, I'm here for me.

45:09.568 --> 45:12.335
Because I built this company
just as much as you did.

45:12.337 --> 45:14.270
That's a bold statement.

45:14.272 --> 45:16.906
That's a true statement.

45:16.908 --> 45:19.742
I put you back together again

45:19.744 --> 45:21.944
when your whole world burned.

45:26.484 --> 45:29.985
And I found meaning in that.

45:29.987 --> 45:31.886
I still do.

45:31.888 --> 45:34.089
I'm not...

45:34.091 --> 45:37.892
happy here, not always. Not... now.

45:41.097 --> 45:44.499
But meaning matters more
to me than happiness.

45:44.501 --> 45:49.504
And I am in this water

45:49.506 --> 45:51.005
because I don't want to see
you throw it all anyway

45:51.007 --> 45:52.240
when you don't have to.

45:52.242 --> 45:54.342
I know.

45:57.679 --> 45:59.412
And I don't want us to lose you.

46:10.725 --> 46:13.492
I wanna make a deal. Will he make one?

46:13.494 --> 46:16.028
- Yes.
- Will I be able to live with it?

46:19.233 --> 46:21.733
That's up to you.

46:21.735 --> 46:23.769
That has nothing to do with the deal.

46:38.084 --> 46:40.351
How do you feel?

46:40.353 --> 46:42.086
Like somebody else.

46:44.558 --> 46:46.357
What am I gonna say about it?

46:49.695 --> 46:52.128
That I did the right thing.

46:56.468 --> 46:58.702
For all of us.

47:06.877 --> 47:09.278
Adam, hi.

47:09.280 --> 47:13.349
Uh, just wanted to thank you
for stopping by the other day.

47:13.351 --> 47:17.520
I thought about what you said,
and I'm not gonna recuse myself.

47:17.522 --> 47:20.223
Well, that's unfortunate.

47:20.225 --> 47:22.123
I believe the Greeks
call that hamartia.

47:22.125 --> 47:23.758
I disagree,

47:23.760 --> 47:26.528
because I'm not gonna lose, and
there will not be an appeal.

47:26.530 --> 47:28.996
Axelrod surrendered.

47:28.998 --> 47:30.398
What? A deal?

47:30.400 --> 47:32.400
Mm-hmm. Yeah, we have
a deal on the table,

47:32.402 --> 47:36.438
a termination, a plea,
and $1.9 billion.

47:37.974 --> 47:40.307
Biggest insider fine ever paid.

47:40.309 --> 47:42.175
Anyway, thanks again.

47:42.177 --> 47:44.077
Give my regards to the maestro.

47:44.079 --> 47:46.580
You got it, Chuck. Good job.

47:51.220 --> 47:54.154
Your father's still holding
on the other line.

47:57.425 --> 47:58.891
Dad, hello.

47:58.893 --> 48:02.662
Chuckie boy, I heard. I
heard you took him down.

48:02.664 --> 48:06.299
I'm, uh, I'm smoking a
cigar for you right now...

48:06.301 --> 48:07.800
as soon as I get outside.

48:07.802 --> 48:09.469
I'm not supposed to
in the house now that

48:09.471 --> 48:10.770
your mother heard Wendy's rule.

48:10.772 --> 48:13.672
But congratulations!

48:13.674 --> 48:15.574
Yeah, we're quite happy with the terms.

48:15.576 --> 48:17.576
- Well, it's the smart play.
- Yeah.

48:17.578 --> 48:19.844
And even as a kid, you would
never get into a fight

48:19.846 --> 48:21.680
unless you knew you could win it.

48:21.682 --> 48:25.884
Oh, do you remember that Mintz boy?

48:25.886 --> 48:27.552
He was a head taller than you,

48:27.554 --> 48:29.020
probably could've made you eat dirt.

48:29.022 --> 48:32.156
And he left that ball field
thinking you were best friends.

48:32.158 --> 48:33.491
Okay, Dad, I gotta go.

48:33.493 --> 48:36.126
And then I made sure he
didn't get into Dalton.

48:36.128 --> 48:37.728
Goodbye!

48:41.167 --> 48:42.933
Highest fucking fine ever levied...

48:42.935 --> 48:44.769
$1.9 billion.

48:44.771 --> 48:46.036
We got everything we wanted.

48:46.038 --> 48:47.537
Family office. Sure.

48:47.539 --> 48:48.971
- Yeah.
- That's worse

48:48.973 --> 48:51.174
than the fucking fine.

48:51.176 --> 48:53.610
The money I can get
back, but not my name.

48:53.612 --> 48:55.578
We'll petition for reinstatement,

48:55.580 --> 48:59.081
after Rhoades leaves, after
the White House turns over.

48:59.083 --> 49:00.483
We'll get it.

49:00.485 --> 49:03.585
You'll be managing outside
money again within five years.

49:03.587 --> 49:07.456
That's five years I'll never get back.

49:07.458 --> 49:08.657
Where's the silverware?

49:08.659 --> 49:11.427
No, it's, uh, it's Ethiopian.

49:11.429 --> 49:15.163
I got you extra injera, and,
uh, you use your hands.

49:18.669 --> 49:22.169
This is an opportunity
to be here with us.

49:22.171 --> 49:24.372
Step it up, Ben Kim.

49:24.374 --> 49:26.674
Step... it... up.

49:26.676 --> 49:29.544
Sorry. I'll go... I'll go get some.

49:29.546 --> 49:31.346
You have it?

49:31.348 --> 49:33.581
Right here.

49:51.500 --> 49:54.234
Uh... there's one other thing.

49:54.236 --> 49:56.168
I do not like other things.

49:56.170 --> 49:59.938
I sensed a possible waffle on
the specifics of the plea.

49:59.940 --> 50:02.341
Connerty did commit to a no guilty plea

50:02.343 --> 50:05.411
but said he would have to
reconfirm with Rhoades.

50:05.413 --> 50:07.279
What could they come with?

50:07.281 --> 50:10.783
At worst, the company will have
to plead guilty to conspiracy.

50:10.785 --> 50:12.817
- Fuck.
- Penalty is the same.

50:12.819 --> 50:14.586
An admission of guilt?

50:17.190 --> 50:20.425
If they put that in
front of me tomorrow,

50:20.427 --> 50:22.894
I don't think I can sign it.

50:35.274 --> 50:36.707
It's gonna be okay.

50:36.709 --> 50:39.042
Mm.

51:06.236 --> 51:08.437
They're coming up.

51:28.190 --> 51:30.023
You've been briefed by
your lawyers, Mr. Axelrod.

51:30.025 --> 51:33.226
We'll try to get you out of
here as soon as possible.

51:33.228 --> 51:36.729
"As part of the proposed
global resolution,

51:36.731 --> 51:39.766
the defendant agrees to an
aggregate financial penalty

51:39.768 --> 51:42.401
of $1.9 billion.

51:42.403 --> 51:45.572
To the termination of their
investment advisory business

51:45.574 --> 51:47.674
and...

51:47.676 --> 51:51.243
the company agrees to plead
guilty to conspiracy."

52:00.287 --> 52:02.354
Do we have a deal, Mr. Axelrod?

52:15.869 --> 52:18.669
Okay.

52:18.671 --> 52:20.905
Okay.

52:20.907 --> 52:23.774
Axe Capital accepts such a penalty as

52:23.776 --> 52:26.210
fair, reasonable, and adequate
within the limitations

52:26.212 --> 52:28.945
Congress has imposed
on federal regulators

52:28.947 --> 52:31.147
to recover investor losses.

52:31.149 --> 52:34.651
Bryan...

52:34.653 --> 52:38.454
didn't he say that he
would never settle?

52:38.456 --> 52:40.557
That's what he's been saying.

52:40.559 --> 52:42.959
You know, out there, you
guys always talk so tough,

52:42.961 --> 52:46.094
but you always end up in here.

52:46.096 --> 52:48.664
Why is that?

52:48.666 --> 52:51.667
Because he knows he's a crook.

52:51.669 --> 52:54.003
Innocent people would never
take a hit like that.

52:54.005 --> 52:55.604
Beyond the pale. My client...

52:55.606 --> 52:57.773
You got me, Rhoades.

52:57.775 --> 52:59.708
$1.9 billion.

52:59.710 --> 53:01.876
It's gonna hurt.

53:01.878 --> 53:04.412
But not... not like a shark bite.

53:04.414 --> 53:06.748
It's more like a... what? A bee sting.

53:06.750 --> 53:10.018
Bee sting? No, that hurts.
More like a horse-fly.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.686
One of those little green horse-flies?

53:11.688 --> 53:12.987
Yeah, a nasty nip.

53:12.989 --> 53:15.322
No, more like an ant. Like a red ant.

53:15.324 --> 53:19.927
Yeah, yeah. Stings for a minute
but doesn't ruin the picnic.

53:19.929 --> 53:22.863
"Plea Agreement is subject
to judicial approval,

53:22.865 --> 53:25.065
pursuant to Rule 11

53:25.067 --> 53:28.134
of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure."

53:28.136 --> 53:30.637
Actually, it's good to
get past this stuff.

53:30.639 --> 53:32.238
You know, just get it out of the way.

53:32.240 --> 53:34.908
And we can make that $1.9
back in, what, eight months?

53:34.910 --> 53:36.809
Six.

53:36.811 --> 53:39.311
The termination of Axe
Capital's advisory business

53:39.313 --> 53:41.948
closes the fund to outside investors.

53:41.950 --> 53:46.385
Yeah, you can score that one for
the superstars over at the SEC.

53:46.387 --> 53:47.820
As a family office,

53:47.822 --> 53:50.389
Mr. Axelrod can invest
his personal assets...

53:50.391 --> 53:52.958
No.

53:52.960 --> 53:56.127
No family office.

53:56.129 --> 53:57.328
Lifetime ban.

54:06.740 --> 54:08.707
Put the money in a trust, fine.

54:08.709 --> 54:11.108
but you never trade securities again.

54:13.913 --> 54:17.380
Not for institutions, not
for individual investors,

54:17.382 --> 54:19.316
not even for yourself.

54:50.547 --> 54:52.881
What the fuck just happened?

55:48.502 --> 55:49.802
I heard.

55:52.405 --> 55:54.972
How did it happen?

55:54.974 --> 55:58.976
The moment came and,
uh, Axe blew a gasket.

55:58.978 --> 56:02.246
Took down the whole meeting.

56:02.248 --> 56:04.115
Tore the check up into tiny pieces.

56:04.117 --> 56:08.319
I thought he might trash
the room on his way out.

56:08.321 --> 56:11.387
Christ.

56:11.389 --> 56:14.691
We're back to this.

56:14.693 --> 56:16.492
No, it's fucking worse.

56:16.494 --> 56:19.863
I c... I can't... live in the middle.

56:19.865 --> 56:23.066
You... you won't.

56:23.068 --> 56:26.936
I've decided, for the
good of our marriage,

56:26.938 --> 56:30.973
I'm not gonna be a part of
the case going forward.

56:30.975 --> 56:33.175
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

56:33.177 --> 56:35.410
I've recused myself.

56:35.412 --> 56:37.813
I already notified Washington.

56:39.751 --> 56:43.184
- I am proud of you.
- Mm.

56:43.186 --> 56:45.787
Looking past yourself.

56:45.789 --> 56:47.021
Seeing the bigger picture.

56:47.023 --> 56:48.322
Five years ago, you wouldn't have.

56:48.324 --> 56:52.393
That... is substantial fucking growth.

56:55.966 --> 56:57.398
Mmm.

57:09.145 --> 57:12.712
I gotta go walk the dog.

57:12.714 --> 57:14.014
Mm.

57:16.051 --> 57:17.583
I'll be back.

57:22.991 --> 57:24.891
Thanks for coming out so late.

57:24.893 --> 57:26.893
Always.

57:26.895 --> 57:29.361
You're a goddamn hero

57:29.363 --> 57:30.930
for standing up to those pricks today.

57:30.932 --> 57:33.166
Okay.

57:33.168 --> 57:36.201
You can count on me to
finish what you started.

57:36.203 --> 57:38.303
I'm all in.

57:38.305 --> 57:39.604
And I'm gonna put a hurt on him

57:39.606 --> 57:40.972
that he can't buy his way out of.

57:40.974 --> 57:43.241
Good. I want you to keep me in the loop

57:43.243 --> 57:44.976
about what you're doing.

57:44.978 --> 57:48.079
But you're recusing yourself.

57:48.081 --> 57:50.481
I'm still gonna need you
to keep me informed.

57:50.483 --> 57:52.917
Then you're not really recused.

57:52.919 --> 57:56.987
I am. Officially.

57:56.989 --> 57:59.023
There can't be any trail back to me.

57:59.025 --> 58:01.491
No documents, no e-mail
chains, no witnesses.

58:01.493 --> 58:03.227
We only talk behind closed doors.

58:03.229 --> 58:05.362
I can handle this case on my own.

58:05.364 --> 58:07.864
Of course you can, but
the gloves are off.

58:07.866 --> 58:11.968
We do whatever it takes.
