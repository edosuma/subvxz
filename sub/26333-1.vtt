WEBVTT

00:00.062 --> 00:03.950
_

00:22.440 --> 00:24.660
I'm not asking you to
give me the lease for free.

00:24.662 --> 00:27.464
I'm telling you to overcharge
me on the rest of the building

00:27.466 --> 00:30.233
and then look the other way
for the rent on that space.

00:30.235 --> 00:34.003
Oh, you can't or you won't?

00:34.005 --> 00:36.506
Ashley, I got this. Why
don't you take a long lunch?

00:36.508 --> 00:38.340
- Okay.
- Because if you can't, Alan,

00:38.342 --> 00:40.075
I got to talk to the person who can.

00:40.077 --> 00:42.911
And if you won't, well, let's
talk about why you won't.

00:42.913 --> 00:46.014
I always say that everything
happens for a reason.

00:46.016 --> 00:48.484
Now, I have something I have to get to,

00:48.486 --> 00:51.720
so I have exactly five more
minutes to spend on this,

00:51.722 --> 00:54.456
but just so we're clear,
at the end of this call,

00:54.458 --> 00:57.126
we will either have a deal

00:57.128 --> 00:59.861
or we will never have a deal.

01:02.015 --> 01:04.933
No, no, no! No, today is the day!

01:04.935 --> 01:06.368
I can't be in this marriage anymore,

01:06.370 --> 01:07.642
and I want to be with you.

01:07.645 --> 01:09.845
Now, in exactly 5 hours, 12 minutes,

01:09.848 --> 01:11.181
Katherine's gonna come home.

01:11.184 --> 01:14.364
She's gonna want to get
takeout Indian food again.

01:14.367 --> 01:15.910
My people are from Milwaukee.

01:15.912 --> 01:17.912
We weren't bred to
eat that much vindaloo.

01:21.351 --> 01:23.284
I don't know what I'm gonna tell Theo.

01:23.286 --> 01:25.853
Maybe that Daddy needs to be happy.

01:25.855 --> 01:28.489
- Eddie?
- Damn it.

01:28.491 --> 01:30.258
I forgot my briefcase.

01:30.260 --> 01:31.759
Didn't you notice I left it?

01:31.761 --> 01:33.961
Ah. Hey, you!

01:33.963 --> 01:35.396
Great.

01:35.398 --> 01:37.198
Now I lost an hour out of my day.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.688
Now I don't have time to pick up Theo.

01:38.690 --> 01:39.933
Uh, you got him, right?

01:39.935 --> 01:42.436
Oh. Actually, I was gonna
teach a guitar lesson at noon.

01:42.438 --> 01:44.705
Unbelievable. She didn't file
the motion, like I told her to.

01:44.707 --> 01:46.840
Why is everyone an idiot?

01:46.842 --> 01:49.243
Okay, so, uh, you got Theo?

01:49.245 --> 01:51.312
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:51.314 --> 01:52.513
See you tonight.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.334
Sorry to keep you waiting, Gary.

02:14.336 --> 02:16.503
Just wanted to review your X-ray.

02:16.505 --> 02:18.345
It's in line with what I was expecting.

02:18.348 --> 02:20.607
Wow, Doc. The suspense is killing me.

02:21.711 --> 02:22.910
Is anything else killing me?

02:22.912 --> 02:25.512
The fact is...

02:25.514 --> 02:26.747
Dr. Martin.

02:26.749 --> 02:28.682
No, I was very clear...

02:28.684 --> 02:30.584
Balsamic vinaigrette.

02:30.586 --> 02:32.485
Yes, they do. I get salad
there three days a week.

02:32.487 --> 02:34.154
It's right next to the edamame.

02:34.156 --> 02:35.622
Are you looking at the edamame?

02:35.624 --> 02:37.891
That brownish liquid next
to the edamame is called...

02:37.893 --> 02:38.959
Sorry.

02:38.961 --> 02:40.427
I don't mean to interrupt

02:40.429 --> 02:42.862
what sounds like a super
important salad conversation.

02:42.865 --> 02:45.098
I just have one quick question.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.633
Is my cancer back?

02:47.636 --> 02:50.770
And so more than three
years after the crisis began,

02:50.773 --> 02:53.973
the class-action lawsuit
is once again making

02:53.975 --> 02:56.676
water in Flint,
Michigan, front-page news.

03:24.506 --> 03:26.873
...were aware of the contamination.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.809
For months, Flint
reside were unaware that

03:29.811 --> 03:33.712
water from their own faucet
was silently killing them.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.715
When the defendants became
aware of the crisis...

03:47.399 --> 03:50.133
...water crisis in
Flint as a wake-up call.

03:55.770 --> 03:56.936
What?!

03:56.938 --> 03:58.404
You're not gonna believe this.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.294
Jon killed himself.

04:37.777 --> 04:42.947

04:46.888 --> 04:49.775
This is our chance! One
time it! One time it!

04:51.114 --> 04:54.825
Way to go, Pastrnák! Whoo!

04:54.827 --> 04:56.427
Never, ever count out my B's!

04:56.429 --> 04:57.929
30 seconds ago, you said they sucked.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.196
30 seconds ago, they did suck.

04:59.198 --> 05:01.432
Hey, guys, I want to
get a photo really quick.

05:01.434 --> 05:02.600
Uh, do yourself a favor, Ed,

05:02.602 --> 05:04.335
and tuck that hideous necklace, please?

05:04.337 --> 05:07.004
Uh, this good-luck charm just
got the Bruins their last goal.

05:07.006 --> 05:08.739
Oh, really? I thought it was Pastrnák.

05:08.741 --> 05:10.635
Damn it. I can't believe
Jon is missing this!

05:10.638 --> 05:11.575
I saw it.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.644
And watch your potty mouth,
there, sunshine. You're a lady.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.049
I love the necklace, by the way.

05:15.052 --> 05:16.706
Hey, gentlemen, I just
want to get one photo

05:16.708 --> 05:17.915
with the four of us on opening night.

05:17.917 --> 05:18.916
Can we do that?

05:18.918 --> 05:20.885
"A thirst-quenching, ice-cold beer"

05:20.887 --> 05:22.586
for the commercial director.

05:22.588 --> 05:23.888
Got one for no-nips-McGee.

05:23.890 --> 05:24.722
- Hey!
- Ooh!

05:24.724 --> 05:26.023
I had breast cancer.

05:26.025 --> 05:27.625
I know. No nips.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.360
Oh, my... What?

05:29.362 --> 05:31.329
And a flat ginger ale
for the stay-at-home mom.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.097
Yeah, that's right.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.365
Well, at least I have nips.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.010
Cancer in my body, people.

05:36.013 --> 05:38.697
What is this? Is this another
charm for the necklace?

05:38.700 --> 05:41.619
Oh. I promised Theo I'd bring
him something home from the game.

05:41.622 --> 05:43.604
And now you're gonna be up for
stay-at-home dad of the year.

05:44.614 --> 05:46.744
You think they do that ceremony at home?

05:46.746 --> 05:49.213
Hey, you guys forget
that this stay-at-home dad

05:49.215 --> 05:50.783
was once the lead singer in a band

05:50.786 --> 05:52.717
who opened up for Kings of Leon...

05:52.719 --> 05:53.784
Right over there.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.286
Of course, that was a decade ago,

05:55.288 --> 05:57.054
and you were so wasted
that you forgot it

05:57.056 --> 05:59.557
and the lyrics to the only
decent song you guys had.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.925
Do they have a decent song?

06:00.927 --> 06:03.327
You know, since then, I've
been working on my craft.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.392
- Which means teaching...
- Guitar lessons.

06:05.395 --> 06:06.864
Okay, you guys suck.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.966
And you still owe me
for the guitar lesson

06:08.968 --> 06:11.068
- this week for your daughter.
- Oh, what's that?

06:11.070 --> 06:12.670
Is that Katherine calling
to check on your balls?

06:12.672 --> 06:14.138
When does she need those back?

06:14.140 --> 06:16.007
Guys, wives are off-limits.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.875
- One photo, four of us.
- All right.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.344
Ed, seriously, if money's the
reason you're still together,

06:20.346 --> 06:22.146
I'll write you a check tonight.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.853
Yeah? Life's too short. Just be happy.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.020
That was just last week.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.721
How does this happen?
Why did he do this?

06:30.723 --> 06:32.705
It makes no sense.

06:32.708 --> 06:35.893
Look, I haven't been to church
since I left for college,

06:35.895 --> 06:37.561
but I think I'm gonna
swing by on Sunday,

06:37.563 --> 06:41.427
'cause someone needs
to explain this to me.

06:41.430 --> 06:43.666
"Life's too short. Just be happy"?

06:43.669 --> 06:46.169
How are we supposed to do that,
Jon, without our best friend?

06:46.172 --> 06:47.369
He should be here.

06:47.372 --> 06:50.174
Yeah, knowing some guy he
could call to fix all this.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.077
I just... I can't accept this.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.879
Regina, these are amazing.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.048
What are these, pork? Veal.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.416
- Hey, Gare.
- Pork.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.718
H-Hey, Gare. Stop. Those
are for after the funeral.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.845
Yeah, for the guests actually
capable of expressing human emotion.

07:03.848 --> 07:06.415
After what Gary had to do, he
can have as many as he wants.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.660
I can't imagine having to tell Delilah.

07:27.547 --> 07:30.147
By the way, if any of you
have "delivering horrific news"

07:30.149 --> 07:31.749
on your bucket lists, take it off.

07:31.751 --> 07:33.317
It's not as fun as you'd think.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.322
I went to see her, and I just...

07:38.324 --> 07:39.990
I didn't know what to say.

07:48.934 --> 07:50.468
I mean, what do you say to the woman

07:50.470 --> 07:53.370
who just lost the love of her life?

07:53.372 --> 07:56.140
You guys, this doesn't make any sense.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.476
This is Jon.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.944
Perfect Jon.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.149
How do we know he didn't just fall?

08:06.719 --> 08:08.219
Because he's not 4.

08:08.221 --> 08:12.056
When I spoke to Ashley,
she said that up until then,

08:12.058 --> 08:14.058
it was a normal day at the office.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.193
He wasn't upset.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.829
She said he was making jokes.

08:23.769 --> 08:25.469
No!!

08:28.441 --> 08:31.041
Help! Somebody!

08:33.078 --> 08:35.513
How could he not leave a note?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.815
But, then again, what could
a person possibly write

08:37.817 --> 08:40.130
that could explain any of this?

08:41.852 --> 08:43.119
He could've said something.

08:43.121 --> 08:44.767
Because right now, this doesn't add up.

08:55.382 --> 08:57.793
I want to pick what Dad would pick.

08:57.796 --> 09:00.252
Stripes... no question.

09:00.254 --> 09:02.054
Where are my sunglasses?

09:02.056 --> 09:03.555
Why are we riding in a limo?

09:03.557 --> 09:05.324
Sophie, sweetie, I just need to know

09:05.326 --> 09:07.793
that you know what
you're wearing tomorrow.

09:07.795 --> 09:11.263
Because, honey, I-I want the
three of us to be together.

09:11.265 --> 09:13.465
Okay, Soph, should I just
pick something for you?

09:15.502 --> 09:17.803
I want to play a song
for him at the service.

09:19.874 --> 09:22.975
I mean, if that's okay.

09:22.977 --> 09:24.576
Yeah.

09:29.516 --> 09:30.983
He would love that.

09:33.187 --> 09:34.720
Um, Mom?

09:36.724 --> 09:38.824
Yeah.

09:38.826 --> 09:40.192
I love you guys.

09:41.328 --> 09:43.729
And so, I always find a reason

09:43.731 --> 09:46.598
for Randall and I to
have the lights off.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.735
I'm just not ready for
him to see me like this.

09:49.737 --> 09:53.005
He thinks I'm really into candles.

09:54.909 --> 09:58.043
I like candles. I like pillows.

09:58.045 --> 09:59.152
Sue me.

09:59.155 --> 10:00.846
Thanks, Peggy.

10:00.848 --> 10:02.781
What we alhere share in common

10:02.783 --> 10:05.617
is the incredible relief
to be in remission.

10:05.620 --> 10:08.602
That said, we all take
life after breast cancer

10:08.605 --> 10:09.721
in a different way,

10:09.723 --> 10:12.224
and you have to find the
way that works for you.

10:12.226 --> 10:14.726
Maggie, did you maybe
want to introduce yourself?

10:14.728 --> 10:16.561
Sure.

10:16.563 --> 10:19.398
Okay, um...

10:19.400 --> 10:20.666
My name is Maggie.

10:20.668 --> 10:22.234
Hi, Maggie.

10:22.236 --> 10:24.603
Hi, everyone.

10:24.605 --> 10:26.438
Um...

10:29.009 --> 10:31.143
Honestly...

10:31.145 --> 10:34.813
old me never would've
come to a group like this,

10:34.815 --> 10:38.850
but I just feel like I'm...

10:38.852 --> 10:42.120
I'm in a place where I'm...

10:42.122 --> 10:44.856
where I feel like I, um...

10:44.858 --> 10:47.359
Ooh. I am so sorry.
What is he doing here?

10:47.361 --> 10:48.827
Men get breast cancer, too.

10:48.829 --> 10:50.446
It is a real thing.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.498
It only affects 1% of
us, but it got all of me.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.695
Believe me, I would've
preferred ball cancer.

10:58.405 --> 10:59.738
Sorry, Joan.

10:59.740 --> 11:01.840
The boys are doing
just fine, by the way,

11:01.842 --> 11:03.108
in case you were wondering.

11:03.110 --> 11:04.543
Okay, good to know. Thank you.

11:04.545 --> 11:06.611
Also, I only ate one doughnut, Gail.

11:11.385 --> 11:12.517
I'm Gary.

11:14.995 --> 11:16.128
To friendship.

11:16.131 --> 11:18.223
- To friendship.
- To friendship.

11:18.225 --> 11:21.193
Wait, no, no, no. I'm
not done. I'm not done.

11:21.195 --> 11:23.595
Come on, chuckleheads.

11:23.597 --> 11:25.030
Friendship is when you don't care

11:25.032 --> 11:26.898
when your buddy throws up in your car

11:26.900 --> 11:28.934
when you're taking him back from chemo.

11:28.936 --> 11:30.936
And yet he keeps mentioning it.

11:30.938 --> 11:33.305
Friendship is believing that your friend

11:33.307 --> 11:35.273
will one day make his movie.

11:35.275 --> 11:37.109
What do you think I'm doing?

11:39.079 --> 11:42.280
It's holding a friend's hand
when she loses her restaurant,

11:42.282 --> 11:44.416
'cause you know she's
gonna open up a better one.

11:44.418 --> 11:48.820
It's the person that you trust
with your wallet and your keys

11:48.822 --> 11:50.856
and your wife and your kids.

11:50.858 --> 11:53.392
And it's being able to
have the hard conversations

11:53.394 --> 11:55.093
and be willing to listen.

11:55.095 --> 11:56.661
It's a million little things.

11:56.663 --> 11:59.431
- A million little things.
- A million little things.

11:59.433 --> 12:00.465
A million little things.

12:01.969 --> 12:03.702
Hey, babe.

12:03.704 --> 12:05.303
I know we talked about postponing

12:05.305 --> 12:09.241
our vacation to Kona
because of Jon, but...

12:09.243 --> 12:12.244
I think Jon might be
the reason we should go.

12:20.827 --> 12:21.987
Yeah.

12:27.528 --> 12:29.238
Obviously, my boobs are fake.

12:29.241 --> 12:31.295
Obviously, I'm okay with that.

12:38.839 --> 12:40.539
What?

12:40.541 --> 12:43.241
No. No. It's just, uh...

12:53.754 --> 12:55.854
Life's too short. Just be happy.

12:57.825 --> 13:00.425
Wow, babe. Really beautiful.

13:04.998 --> 13:08.033
Why didn't he just tell
Delilah he was hurting?

13:10.513 --> 13:11.846
You know?

13:16.066 --> 13:18.633
Regina. Thing is...

13:20.543 --> 13:21.847
What is it?

13:23.717 --> 13:25.217
What, babe?

13:31.959 --> 13:33.725
I think we should go to Kona.

13:33.727 --> 13:34.759
Okay.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.464
Mm.

13:55.781 --> 13:57.547
Uh, I-I keep waiting,

13:57.549 --> 14:01.284
'cause it feels weird
starting without Jon here.

14:01.286 --> 14:03.820
A part of me keeps thinking
that, at any moment,

14:03.822 --> 14:07.215
Jon is gonna hang up
that God-awful Blackberry

14:07.218 --> 14:08.625
he refused to get rid of

14:08.627 --> 14:10.460
and...

14:10.462 --> 14:12.696
come barreling through
those doors right there.

14:16.034 --> 14:17.701
Wow.

14:17.703 --> 14:19.202
Sorry. Sorry.

14:21.573 --> 14:23.640
Can we just... just
nudge in with you guys?

14:23.642 --> 14:25.508
All right. Thanks.

14:25.510 --> 14:26.543
All right.

14:26.545 --> 14:28.044
That was perfect.

14:30.382 --> 14:33.883
You see, Jon always said,

14:33.885 --> 14:36.753
"Everything happens for a reason."

14:36.755 --> 14:38.988
He refused to believe in coincidence...

14:38.990 --> 14:40.557
Even how we all met.

14:40.559 --> 14:43.226
People always assume
Jon, Gary, Rome, and I

14:43.228 --> 14:44.794
went to college together.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.629
And Jon was always quick to say,

14:46.631 --> 14:49.532
"You think these douche
bags could get into Harvard?"

14:50.669 --> 14:54.170
No, the real way we met was so random.

14:54.172 --> 14:57.640
We were all on an elevator...

14:57.642 --> 14:59.209
that got stuck.

14:59.211 --> 15:01.478
Now, there are two kinds
of people on elevators...

15:01.480 --> 15:03.413
People who don't talk to strangers

15:03.415 --> 15:04.781
and Jon.

15:04.783 --> 15:07.484
And Jon started talking and talking,

15:07.486 --> 15:10.353
and he got really deep at some points.

15:10.355 --> 15:13.957
And then he found out
we were all Bruins fans.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.626
Even Rome.

15:16.628 --> 15:18.294
- Go, B's.
- That's right.

15:18.296 --> 15:20.396
By the time the Boston Fire Department

15:20.398 --> 15:22.332
pried open those doors,

15:22.334 --> 15:26.736
Jon had convinced us to
go in on season tickets.

15:26.738 --> 15:28.404
Yeah, then he never took our money.

15:28.406 --> 15:31.407
41 home games a year.

15:31.409 --> 15:35.645
In that decade, our friendship
has moved outside the Garden.

15:38.984 --> 15:40.483
A couple of us got married,

15:40.485 --> 15:41.942
a couple of us had kids,

15:41.945 --> 15:43.511
one of us beat cancer,

15:43.514 --> 15:45.481
and one of us got sober.

15:48.727 --> 15:51.027
Jon was the one who pulled me aside

15:51.029 --> 15:53.963
right after Theo was born

15:53.965 --> 15:57.367
and told me that I
needed to stop drinking.

15:57.369 --> 15:59.068
I haven't had a drink
in almost seven years

15:59.070 --> 16:01.237
because that random guy

16:01.239 --> 16:03.740
who I spent 2 1/2 hours
in an elevator with

16:03.742 --> 16:05.241
was there for me.

16:11.854 --> 16:13.763
And it absolutely kills me

16:13.764 --> 16:15.687
that I wasn't there for you, buddy.

16:20.091 --> 16:22.826
Jon, you say everything
happens for a reason.

16:24.077 --> 16:26.262
I can't find a reason for this.

16:34.206 --> 16:37.473
Now Jon's daughter, Sophie,

16:37.475 --> 16:39.876
would like to play a
song for her father.

16:43.882 --> 16:46.199
If she plays something by Bruno Mars,

16:46.202 --> 16:49.185
I will burn this place down.

16:51.022 --> 16:52.789
That was beautiful.

16:52.791 --> 16:53.823
Thank you.

16:57.295 --> 17:00.597
Love you, Daddy.

Wow, you're just... doing that.

17:52.717 --> 17:54.584
Well, you're not talking,

17:54.586 --> 17:57.053
so I'm just trying to figure
out who you really are,

17:57.055 --> 18:00.423
because, uh, "guy with breast cancer"

18:00.425 --> 18:04.093
seems to be the least
surprising thing about you.

18:04.095 --> 18:06.496
Uh, you're... You're
running low on this.

18:06.498 --> 18:07.949
I wasn't sure if you knew that.

18:07.952 --> 18:10.500
Oh! Bull's-eye. Charleston Chews.

18:10.502 --> 18:11.501
These are my favorite.

18:11.503 --> 18:13.084
Uh, no, no, no. Don't eat that.

18:13.087 --> 18:14.887
I have no idea where
that even came from.

18:16.608 --> 18:18.041
Any idea where this came from?

18:18.043 --> 18:21.311
Probably whoever owned that candy bar.

18:23.949 --> 18:25.615
I'm so sorry.

18:25.617 --> 18:27.583
Thanks, Ashley.

18:27.585 --> 18:29.843
You were amazing through all of this.

18:30.722 --> 18:32.922
You were so important to Jon.

18:36.594 --> 18:39.529
Do you... Do you have any idea why?

18:50.442 --> 18:52.976
He was always so happy
at work. I don't...

18:55.012 --> 18:57.546
- I didn't mean...
- No, no. I know.

18:57.549 --> 18:58.648
It's okay.

19:02.220 --> 19:04.020
Just give me a second.

19:05.781 --> 19:06.956
Hey.

19:09.094 --> 19:11.427
Just to be clear...

19:11.429 --> 19:13.196
I don't want to be here.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.467
Yeah. Makes two of us.

19:23.241 --> 19:25.808
For the record...

19:25.810 --> 19:28.911
You are stronger than
all of us combined.

19:46.731 --> 19:48.473
Hey. Ro, you coming?

19:48.476 --> 19:50.166
Y-Yeah, I just forgot these, man.

19:51.169 --> 19:52.201
That's smart.

19:52.203 --> 19:53.804
Their living room gets very sunny.

19:55.031 --> 19:57.073
Hey, I heard about the Shasta campaign.

19:57.075 --> 19:58.408
Congrats. That's amazing.

19:58.410 --> 19:59.842
Yeah, well, it's not making my movie,

19:59.844 --> 20:01.044
but if I can get one person...

20:01.046 --> 20:03.179
Just one person... To buy soda...

20:04.416 --> 20:05.782
How's work with you?

20:05.784 --> 20:07.817
Ugh. Crazy, as usual.

20:07.819 --> 20:09.986
Just rushing in to give
Delilah a quick hug.

20:09.988 --> 20:12.355
I didn't realize this
would be an all-day thing.

20:14.025 --> 20:16.526
Welcome to my world.

20:17.796 --> 20:19.059
Just confirming...

20:19.062 --> 20:21.798
You brought a date to
our friend's funeral.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.399
It was morning, okay?

20:23.401 --> 20:26.369
I wanted to buy her breakfast,
and... we ran out of time.

20:26.371 --> 20:28.062
So I made her breakfast?

20:29.161 --> 20:30.473
And where'd you meet this one?

20:30.475 --> 20:32.263
10 bucks says his
breast-cancer support group,

20:32.265 --> 20:34.143
and if I'm right, you're gross.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.945
And you're 10 bucks richer.

20:35.947 --> 20:38.381
So, what, you're just working
your way around the circle?

20:38.383 --> 20:41.176
I got to be honest... It
doesn't feel like work to me.

20:41.179 --> 20:42.285
That's just...

20:42.287 --> 20:43.719
- What?
- ...not okay.

20:43.721 --> 20:45.247
- Nothing's okay about that.
- That's very okay.

20:45.249 --> 20:46.465
No, it's so not.

20:46.468 --> 20:50.159
That night that my water
broke, he had the car five days.

20:51.396 --> 20:53.830
Yeah, I don't know how he
got them to take it back.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.967
He had a way with people.

20:57.969 --> 20:59.268
Yeah.

20:59.270 --> 21:01.571
He always made me feel like
I was part of the group.

21:06.744 --> 21:08.444
All right, everybody. Listen up.

21:08.446 --> 21:10.313
This is Maggie? Right? Okay.

21:10.315 --> 21:13.416
- This is Rome, Regina, and Ed.
- Eddie.

21:13.418 --> 21:15.194
That was a beautiful eulogy.

21:15.197 --> 21:16.496
Yeah. You made this one cry.

21:16.499 --> 21:18.710
Are we sure that's why she was crying?

21:18.713 --> 21:21.057
Okay, just so you're not left out,

21:21.059 --> 21:24.193
a long time ago, these
two went on a date.

21:24.195 --> 21:26.195
One horrendous date.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.699
What is this? Why are we doing this?

21:27.702 --> 21:29.298
- Man up.
- Well, you say it was bad,

21:29.300 --> 21:31.467
but did it end with him
taking you to a funeral?

21:32.770 --> 21:34.656
I love her so much.

21:34.659 --> 21:35.972
Who is this woman?

21:37.108 --> 21:40.143
I mean, why didn't he get help?

21:40.145 --> 21:43.479
I mean, to a lot of
people, it's still taboo.

21:43.481 --> 21:44.881
On my dad's side, they'd be like,

21:44.883 --> 21:47.183
"We black. We don't talk
about that. We got Jesus."

21:50.054 --> 21:53.122
Maybe... he just lost
sight of the horizon.

21:55.994 --> 21:59.495
I-I was watching this
documentary on JFK Jr.

21:59.497 --> 22:01.664
You remember when his plane went down?

22:01.666 --> 22:03.499
July 16, 1999.

22:04.769 --> 22:05.942
It's my birthday.

22:05.945 --> 22:08.037
No. Your birthday is the 12th.

22:08.039 --> 22:09.879
This is the only grown
man ever in existence

22:09.882 --> 22:12.074
to celebrate his
birthday for a whole week.

22:13.178 --> 22:15.811
"Happy birth week" is not a thing yet.

22:15.813 --> 22:18.590
Anyway, Kennedy was a novice pilot,

22:18.593 --> 22:22.618
and he was flying at night,
and the clouds came in.

22:22.620 --> 22:25.121
His instruments were
telling him which way was up,

22:25.124 --> 22:26.589
but he didn't trust them.

22:26.591 --> 22:29.592
The truth was right in front
of him, and he couldn't see it.

22:29.594 --> 22:31.827
And he lost sight of the horizon

22:31.829 --> 22:34.063
and nose-dived.

22:34.065 --> 22:37.233
And by the time he
realized what was happening,

22:37.235 --> 22:41.003
it was too late, and
he couldn't pull up.

22:41.005 --> 22:42.338
And what does this have to do...

22:42.340 --> 22:45.474
That's... depression.

22:47.712 --> 22:49.504
Now, maybe he wasn't depressed.

22:49.507 --> 22:51.881
I mean, maybe something
else was going on.

22:51.883 --> 22:55.985
People keep secrets from their
close friends and loved ones.

22:55.987 --> 22:58.746
Sometimes, you don't even
know they have these secrets

22:58.749 --> 23:01.390
until, um...

23:01.392 --> 23:03.326
an event like this happens.

23:09.167 --> 23:11.067
Okie-doke.

23:11.069 --> 23:15.207
Apparently, Maggie moonlights
as an armchair psychologist.

23:15.210 --> 23:16.372
It's true.

23:16.374 --> 23:19.175
But during the day, I'm
a clinical psychologist

23:19.177 --> 23:23.045
at Boston General, specializing in...

23:23.047 --> 23:24.580
depression.

23:29.020 --> 23:32.855
Tell me you knew the occupation
of your funeral plus-one.

23:32.857 --> 23:36.092
No, he did not.

23:36.094 --> 23:38.194
No, I did not.

23:39.764 --> 23:41.998
Hey, Maggie?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.637
Would you mind if I
got your business card?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.031
Oh. Yeah, sure.

23:46.034 --> 23:48.938
The whole thing you were saying about
losing sight of the horizon was...

23:48.940 --> 23:50.039
Yeah.

23:50.041 --> 23:52.408
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa. Really?

23:52.411 --> 23:54.247
Because I went on one date

23:54.250 --> 23:55.878
a million years ago with your wife?

23:55.880 --> 23:57.580
No, you know what? I want this for you.

23:57.582 --> 24:00.604
The movie I'm trying to
make has a therapist in it.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.340
Okay? Ohh.

24:02.343 --> 24:04.043
Just want to ask Maggie a few questions.

24:04.046 --> 24:04.954
Okay.

24:08.559 --> 24:10.934
There's a Bruins game
tonight, isn't there?

24:10.937 --> 24:12.662
And Jon hated waiting for us.

24:12.664 --> 24:14.764
Made us set an alarm on our damn phones.

24:14.766 --> 24:16.332
You guys should go.

24:16.334 --> 24:17.633
Seriously, you should go.

24:17.635 --> 24:19.769
You know he wouldn't want
the tickets going to waste.

24:19.771 --> 24:23.820
And, uh, I can use some time
alone with my best friend.

24:23.823 --> 24:25.474
And my new friend.

24:25.476 --> 24:26.790
Maggie, please stay.

24:26.793 --> 24:28.457
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.546
Yeah. All right. Well, we
fully support this plan.

24:30.548 --> 24:33.949
There's only one problem... The tickets.

24:33.951 --> 24:35.818
Are in Jon's office.

24:35.820 --> 24:37.453
Correct.

24:37.455 --> 24:41.791
So, anyway, we just... We
wanted to be in his space

24:41.793 --> 24:43.518
for a little while, get some closure,

24:43.521 --> 24:45.254
let the reality of
what happened sink in.

24:45.257 --> 24:46.090
You need the tickets.

24:46.092 --> 24:47.187
- Yep.
- Yeah.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.700
Ash, what are you doing here?
Tell me you're not working.

24:50.702 --> 24:53.869
Just tying up odds and ends.

24:53.871 --> 24:56.138
You got to love odds and ends.

24:57.141 --> 24:58.864
- Shut it down.
- What?

24:58.867 --> 25:01.377
Jon specifically said
do not have sex with her.

25:01.379 --> 25:03.355
And we're sure he was talking to me?

25:24.736 --> 25:27.837
I feel like I just threw a party.

25:27.839 --> 25:31.040
For Jon. He's not even here.

25:31.042 --> 25:33.075
He would've loved it.

25:33.077 --> 25:34.110
Hm.

25:34.112 --> 25:35.578
He would've been so mad

25:35.580 --> 25:38.170
that I let people in the
house with their shoes on.

25:43.898 --> 25:47.199
I just felt like I had to make
it easy for everybody today.

25:50.895 --> 25:52.843
How could I not know?

25:55.166 --> 25:58.167
How could I not see it?

25:58.169 --> 26:00.503
We're here for you.

26:00.505 --> 26:02.071
I'm here for you.

26:03.647 --> 26:04.946
Whatever you need.

26:06.944 --> 26:10.346
I need a time machine.

26:16.687 --> 26:18.921
Do you have any idea why he did this?

26:18.923 --> 26:21.803
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

26:21.806 --> 26:24.160
Sorry. I just, uh...

26:24.162 --> 26:26.251
You know, you were with him all day.

26:26.254 --> 26:28.454
Didn't know him like you guys did.

26:29.901 --> 26:31.033
What's the code?

26:39.277 --> 26:40.876
See?

26:40.878 --> 26:42.645
There are things you know that we don't.

26:45.047 --> 26:47.496
He was on that business
call for a really long time.

26:47.499 --> 26:48.761
It's not the last call he made.

26:48.764 --> 26:50.519
No, yeah, it was.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.354
When I came in to give him the mail,

26:52.356 --> 26:55.253
he was standing on the balcony,
just finishing up the call.

26:55.256 --> 26:56.959
He made a call right after that.

26:58.696 --> 27:00.062
To you.

27:11.070 --> 27:15.467
Yeah, Jon called you at 12:27.

27:15.469 --> 27:18.570
Uh, yeah... Mondays, noon,

27:18.572 --> 27:22.707
I teach this kid, Talbot,
guitar during his lunch break.

27:22.709 --> 27:26.027
Uh, I turn my phone off. It
rang once during a recital.

27:26.030 --> 27:27.779
Yelled at the parents,
which was brilliant,

27:27.781 --> 27:29.878
'cause it turned out to be my phone.

27:32.586 --> 27:34.319
He tried to call me.

27:36.423 --> 27:38.123
You can't do what
you're doing right now.

27:38.125 --> 27:39.925
- But maybe I could've...
- No, stop it.

27:39.928 --> 27:40.925
Ashley...

27:40.927 --> 27:42.694
I'll get the tickets.

27:42.696 --> 27:44.929
No, I just like to give Gary crap.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.332
Seriously, Gary's an amazing friend.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.200
Underneath that hot mess is...

27:49.202 --> 27:50.902
A lukewarm mess?

27:50.904 --> 27:53.238
I just never thought

27:53.240 --> 27:56.875
that a guy like Gary
would be the first man

27:56.877 --> 27:59.044
to truly understand
what I am going through.

28:03.272 --> 28:04.671
Were you scared?

28:06.058 --> 28:07.152
Yeah.

28:07.154 --> 28:08.355
I see that in Gary.

28:08.358 --> 28:09.987
H-He tries to hide it,

28:09.990 --> 28:12.557
but even though he's in remission,

28:12.559 --> 28:15.060
it's like he's afraid...

28:15.062 --> 28:17.629
That it's gonna come back.

28:17.631 --> 28:19.164
Is it the same for you?

28:20.967 --> 28:24.102
As much as I can be similar to Gary.

28:36.030 --> 28:37.196
To Jon.

28:37.199 --> 28:39.832
And to that tradition he
started on the elevator

28:39.835 --> 28:41.301
all those years ago.

28:42.823 --> 28:45.824
I-I... I'm not drinking to that.

28:45.826 --> 28:47.092
I spend 40 hours a week

28:47.094 --> 28:50.028
valuing people's lives
for insurance companies.

28:50.030 --> 28:53.131
The time that we spend together
isn't worth a damn thing.

28:53.133 --> 28:54.466
- Dude.
- Really?

28:54.468 --> 28:56.468
Do the math... Average
length of a hockey game

28:56.470 --> 28:58.369
is 2 hours, 19 minutes,

28:58.371 --> 29:02.040
times 41 home games for 10 years...

29:02.042 --> 29:07.946
That means I spent almost
950 hours sitting next to Jon,

29:07.948 --> 29:10.348
and I had no idea that he was depressed.

29:10.350 --> 29:12.300
Did you? Did you?

29:12.303 --> 29:14.619
No. You want to know why?

29:14.621 --> 29:16.472
Because we don't talk.

29:16.475 --> 29:17.474
Yes, we do.

29:17.477 --> 29:19.176
No. Ed, we don't.

29:19.179 --> 29:21.128
The last time we said anything deep

29:21.131 --> 29:23.865
was when we were in that elevator.

29:23.868 --> 29:25.495
We were more honest with each other

29:25.498 --> 29:26.797
before we were friends.

29:26.800 --> 29:27.832
Now we do this.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.768
We sit shoulder-to-shoulder like guys,

29:29.770 --> 29:31.160
like we're doing right now.

29:31.163 --> 29:36.307
And the truth, the very
sad truth, is that...

29:36.309 --> 29:38.160
we don't really know each other.

29:38.163 --> 29:41.706
I bet you two don't even
know what color my eyes are.

29:41.709 --> 29:43.548
Yeah. I'll drink.

29:43.550 --> 29:46.017
I-I'll drink to whatever
we thought this was.

29:50.090 --> 29:51.988
Think I liked you better with cancer.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.652
Me too.

29:53.655 --> 29:55.293
You have your own place?

29:55.295 --> 29:57.428
I did.

29:57.430 --> 30:00.265
I opened a restaurant with an investor.

30:00.267 --> 30:02.100
It was years ago now.

30:02.102 --> 30:04.355
But she rented way too big a space.

30:04.358 --> 30:07.104
We just... couldn't make the rent.

30:07.107 --> 30:08.940
The first time I ever met Jon,

30:08.942 --> 30:11.209
he helped me get out of that lease.

30:11.211 --> 30:13.417
I didn't even know him.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.446
I mean, he was doing it
more as a favor to Rome,

30:15.448 --> 30:18.216
but... but still...

30:18.218 --> 30:19.651
Wow.

30:21.688 --> 30:24.889
And because of Jon, I'm not giving up.

30:24.891 --> 30:28.410
I'm gonna open up my
own place again someday.

30:28.413 --> 30:31.663
And this time, I'm gonna do it right.

30:36.506 --> 30:38.000
Grab your coats.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.471
Oh, I'm so glad you said
that. It's freezing out here.

30:40.473 --> 30:42.340
No, we're gonna go on a road trip.

30:42.342 --> 30:44.209
I need to show you something.

30:44.211 --> 30:45.910
What is it?

30:45.912 --> 30:49.047
It's the last thing
Jon did before he died.

30:50.350 --> 30:53.451
Look, Gary, I know you like to go dark,

30:53.453 --> 30:55.520
but I need this to not be

30:55.522 --> 30:56.921
as horrible as it is,

30:56.923 --> 30:59.891
because I keep thinking that
maybe I could've done something.

30:59.893 --> 31:01.459
Like what, Ed? Like...

31:01.461 --> 31:03.828
Like maybe if you hugged him one
more time, he'd still be alive?

31:03.830 --> 31:06.064
You have magic hugs?
Who the hell are you?

31:06.066 --> 31:08.366
Well, apparently, someone
who's a little more

31:08.368 --> 31:11.803
in touch with his emotions than you are.

31:11.805 --> 31:13.004
Enjoy the game, bro.

31:13.006 --> 31:15.199
Should be a good one.

31:15.202 --> 31:19.577
Maybe Jon's death is like
a wake-up call, you know?

31:19.579 --> 31:21.300
It's like... It's like he always said,

31:21.303 --> 31:22.647
"Everything happens for a reason."

31:22.649 --> 31:23.715
Are you kidding?

31:23.717 --> 31:25.524
Our... Our friend offed himself.

31:25.527 --> 31:26.618
Wh-What are you saying?

31:26.620 --> 31:29.020
If we live better lives, he
wouldn't have died in vain?

31:29.022 --> 31:30.355
Maybe.

31:30.357 --> 31:31.355
Yes. Okay.

31:31.358 --> 31:33.624
Well, I got news for you,
Ed... That's not gonna happen.

31:33.627 --> 31:35.226
'Cause we're not gonna
live any differently.

31:35.228 --> 31:37.095
You hate your stupid
job... Your words...

31:37.097 --> 31:37.938
But you won't quit

31:37.941 --> 31:40.964
because directing
asinine pizza commercials

31:40.967 --> 31:43.067
pays way too much money.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.669
You and your wife
can't stand each other,

31:44.671 --> 31:46.571
but you'll never leave
her... Not ever...

31:46.573 --> 31:49.507
Because you're too afraid
to take a chance on yourself.

31:49.509 --> 31:51.476
People always say they're
gonna live differently.

31:51.478 --> 31:54.579
And you know what? We
will... For exactly two weeks.

31:54.581 --> 31:56.414
And then we'll go right back

31:56.416 --> 31:58.950
to doing the same crap
that we've always done.

31:58.952 --> 32:00.383
I'm in love with someone.

32:03.023 --> 32:04.155
What?

32:04.157 --> 32:07.480
She's a... the mom
of one of my students.

32:07.483 --> 32:09.984
We did not mean for it to happen.

32:09.987 --> 32:13.564
But I love her, and she believes in me.

32:13.566 --> 32:16.534
And I need to leave Katherine,

32:16.536 --> 32:20.004
but I just have to make sure
everything's okay with Theo first.

32:20.006 --> 32:22.707
And I'm in love with beer.

32:22.709 --> 32:24.475
Mind if I go ahead of you guys?

32:24.477 --> 32:26.244
- Sorry 'bout that.
- It's all right, fellas.

32:26.246 --> 32:28.513
Look, Ed, I'm thrilled that you
are getting out of a marriage

32:28.515 --> 32:31.082
that is more toxic than anything
that's ever been in my body,

32:31.084 --> 32:32.917
but it's your need to
credit ending something

32:32.919 --> 32:34.085
that should've ended two years ago

32:34.087 --> 32:36.154
to our friend jumping off
a concrete diving board.

32:36.156 --> 32:37.785
Listen, it's not just that.

32:37.788 --> 32:40.825
It's the fact I haven't
had a drink in seven years

32:40.827 --> 32:43.261
because that same friend
stepped onto an elevator...

32:43.263 --> 32:45.363
Knock it off. Knock it off
with the elevator crap, man.

32:45.365 --> 32:47.098
What do you think I would've
done if I hadn't met you guys?

32:47.100 --> 32:48.183
Seriously.

32:48.186 --> 32:49.707
I would've become friends
with three other schmucks.

32:49.709 --> 32:52.704
I mean, look around. There are
Bruins fans all over the place.

32:54.074 --> 32:55.840
Gary...

32:55.842 --> 32:58.476
how does a man who beat cancer

32:58.478 --> 33:01.679
not see that maybe there is
a reason that things happen?

33:01.681 --> 33:03.183
Let me be very clear.

33:03.186 --> 33:06.851
First of all, God didn't
cure my cancer. Science did.

33:06.853 --> 33:09.754
Secondly, it's not that
I don't have cancer, Ed.

33:09.756 --> 33:13.358
It's that I don't have cancer right now.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.193
The all-clear screening I got this week

33:15.195 --> 33:16.394
just gives me permission

33:16.396 --> 33:18.563
to hold my breath for
another three months!

33:21.234 --> 33:23.001
Hooray for me.

33:31.044 --> 33:34.212
Damn it, Jon. You had...

33:34.214 --> 33:35.346
everything.

33:44.724 --> 33:47.125
Everything happens for a reason? Really?

33:47.127 --> 33:49.961
Tell me one good thing that's
happened because of this.

33:49.963 --> 33:51.596
One.

33:54.644 --> 33:56.644
If you hadn't called
to tell me about Jon,

33:56.647 --> 33:58.347
I would be dead right now.

33:59.472 --> 34:02.373
I had a mouthful of pills
when I answered that phone.

34:04.209 --> 34:07.411
And I know... I know...
I know that sounds crazy...

34:09.349 --> 34:11.416
...because I have an incredible life

34:11.418 --> 34:13.753
and I am married to
the most amazing woman.

34:13.755 --> 34:18.259
But sometimes, I feel so hopeless!

34:18.262 --> 34:20.929
It's like I can't breathe.

34:20.931 --> 34:24.266
Only, I'm breathing.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.230
And I just... I think, you know,

34:26.232 --> 34:29.500
maybe if... If... if I just stopped,

34:29.502 --> 34:31.902
it wouldn't hurt so much.

34:40.031 --> 34:44.233
And for the record,
Gary, your eyes are hazel.

34:44.235 --> 34:46.036
And they're magnificent.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.223
We got you, man.

34:52.225 --> 34:54.192
Come on. We got you. Come on.

35:05.881 --> 35:09.232
So, Ashley told me at
the house today that, uh,

35:09.235 --> 35:13.971
the last thing Jon did was
close this huge real estate deal.

35:13.973 --> 35:15.888
Of course he did.

35:15.891 --> 35:17.174
I wanted you to see it.

35:17.176 --> 35:18.442
Wait... this is it?

35:18.444 --> 35:19.631
Yeah. Jon's last deal

35:19.634 --> 35:21.912
was for the old Griffin
Street Bakery building?

35:21.914 --> 35:23.447
This place is incredible.

35:23.449 --> 35:27.251
On the bottom floor, there is
this great restaurant space.

35:27.253 --> 35:29.520
That's why Jon fought so hard to get it.

35:31.953 --> 35:35.125
Your new restaurant is
opening spring of 2019.

35:35.128 --> 35:36.927
W-What? Wait.

35:39.209 --> 35:40.765
Jon's last deal was for me?

35:40.767 --> 35:42.588
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

35:42.591 --> 35:44.635
- "Why?"
- Yeah.

35:44.637 --> 35:46.716
Because... Because he believed in you.

35:46.719 --> 35:48.466
He was working on it for months,

35:48.469 --> 35:50.552
and he didn't even mention it to Rome.

35:50.555 --> 35:52.542
He wanted to surprise you.

35:52.545 --> 35:54.979
Stop.

36:00.286 --> 36:01.952
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

36:23.265 --> 36:28.178
_

36:39.058 --> 36:40.950
How are we able to do this?

36:40.953 --> 36:43.794
I thought you had a music
lesson to teach today.

36:43.796 --> 36:45.029
Oh, I did.

36:45.031 --> 36:47.231
But Talbot got pink eye.

36:47.233 --> 36:49.312
Oh. Got to love that pink eye.

36:49.315 --> 36:51.569
I'm sorry. Are you
rubbing your eye right now?

36:51.571 --> 36:54.430
I am. Do I have it? Check, please.

36:54.433 --> 36:56.166
God, you are beautiful.

36:57.710 --> 36:59.343
Even with the pink eye.

37:03.670 --> 37:05.482
- Shall we toast?
- Yes.

37:05.485 --> 37:06.784
Where did you get the wine?

37:06.786 --> 37:09.086
Oh, I brought the
wine... And the glasses...

37:09.088 --> 37:10.554
From your house.

37:10.556 --> 37:12.223
I really love this woman.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.398
To Jon.

37:16.496 --> 37:18.086
To Jon.

37:18.180 --> 37:19.329
To Jon.

37:41.854 --> 37:44.921
Say that last part again.

37:44.924 --> 37:48.765
Well, I was saying, you
know, as bad as this seems,

37:48.768 --> 37:52.463
I truly believe that
everything happens for a reason.

37:52.465 --> 37:55.900
The challenge in life
is to find that reason.

38:00.690 --> 38:02.806
You can't be here.

38:02.809 --> 38:04.875
We can't do this.

38:04.877 --> 38:06.177
Not now.

38:07.780 --> 38:10.781
What if he knew about us?

38:10.783 --> 38:12.680
What if that's why he did it?

38:12.683 --> 38:14.418
He didn't know.

38:14.420 --> 38:16.367
Maybe that's why he tried to call you.

38:25.097 --> 38:27.898
You should answer it, just... just so...

38:27.901 --> 38:30.134
No, I'll call him in
10 minutes from the car.

38:31.562 --> 38:32.670
We need to tell...

38:32.672 --> 38:33.838
I know.

38:35.128 --> 38:36.160
I know.

38:37.789 --> 38:40.978
Tell me you don't love me...

38:40.980 --> 38:43.747
and I will leave here right now.

38:47.433 --> 38:51.255
If you love me, you'll leave right now.

38:57.018 --> 38:59.496
Sometimes, w-what
happens is terrible...

38:59.498 --> 39:02.586
...you know, and you think,

39:02.589 --> 39:05.402
"What good could possibly come of this?"

39:07.883 --> 39:10.474
Sometimes, what happens
is so hard to believe

39:10.476 --> 39:12.710
that you refuse to accept the truth.

39:20.052 --> 39:23.554
And sometimes, you
even try to change it.

39:37.823 --> 39:39.570
Maggie, it's Dr. Gordon.

39:39.572 --> 39:41.238
You missed your appointment today.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.207
If we're gonna beat this thing again,

39:43.209 --> 39:45.976
you have to stick to
your chemo schedule.

39:47.564 --> 39:50.422
_

40:02.956 --> 40:04.094
Hi, Daddy.

40:04.097 --> 40:05.497
Oh, hey, bud.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.781
I just wanted to get my hockey stick.

40:09.535 --> 40:10.734
What are you doing?

40:17.310 --> 40:22.313
But... as bad as this seems...

40:22.315 --> 40:24.782
there is good.

40:24.784 --> 40:27.515
And you will find it.

40:27.518 --> 40:30.617
I promise.

40:30.620 --> 40:32.489
Everyone back away from the door!

40:32.491 --> 40:33.557
- Oh!
- Hey!

40:33.559 --> 40:36.694
- Yeah!
- Are you serious?

40:36.696 --> 40:38.629
Ah! Go, B's!

40:38.631 --> 40:40.302
Don't tell me who won the game, though.
