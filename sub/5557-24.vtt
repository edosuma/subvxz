Going to shock some people.
>> barrett has taken a lot of

01:40.207 --> 01:46.812
Country songs and flipped them
but he hasn't taken a major pop

01:46.947 --> 01:49.615
Song and flipped it into what he
does.

01:49.749 --> 01:51.650
>> i was thinking songs and
acoustics.

01:51.785 --> 01:58.991
>> i'm excited about this song.
I kind of had an epiphany into

01:59.125 --> 02:02.528
How to make that song a cool
song.

02:02.662 --> 02:04.997
I want to swamp it up.

Overcoming some things that you
didn't choose in your life.

02:10.637 --> 02:16.442
With my particular story, being
able to overcome immense tragedy

02:16.576 --> 02:18.711
And surviving and plane crash.

Up.
>> you're a winner already in

02:25.685 --> 02:27.753
Life.
>> yeah.

02:27.888 --> 02:31.757

story, your life experience.

02:31.892 --> 02:38.197
>> i appreciate that.
>> ¶ it keeps me away ¶

02:38.331 --> 02:41.233
>> wow, if you had a heavy
handed piano.

02:41.368 --> 02:46.839
Southern gospel feel.
>> it's kind of a crazy thing to

02:46.973 --> 02:49.308
Think about collaborating with
arguably the best person in

02:49.442 --> 02:52.278
Country music.
It makes me think this is my

02:52.412 --> 02:56.181
Path.
>> we're going from 9 to 4.

02:56.316 --> 02:57.182

02:57.317 --> 03:00.686
>> i know.
>> i'm stressing out about a

03:00.820 --> 03:04.623

What a way to like really just
share you'r emotions in the mos

07:26.386 --> 07:28.954
Purest way possible.
It was a moment like i don't

07:29.088 --> 07:32.524
Know what happened back home,
like in here the mic went out.

07:32.659 --> 07:34.359
You were just bulldozing
through, man.

07:34.494 --> 07:37.863
Like that's the way you're
supposed to do it when you're

07:37.997 --> 07:39.164
Tapped into that emotion like
that.

07:39.299 --> 07:44.169
Congratulations.
That was a great performance.

You're on the show, the more
happy i am for you because i

Just remember the blinds.
And it's just such a huge dream

07:54.080 --> 07:58.183
For you to be here and to have
this moment, and i can just see

07:58.318 --> 08:04.489

sharing your talent and it was a

Really powerful performance.

Were going to be here at this
point, i really did.

08:12.732 --> 08:15.634
I think we all did.
You were always one of the

08:15.768 --> 08:17.970
Strongest singers, but i
definitely could never have told

08:18.104 --> 08:20.172
You this was how you were going
to be here and doing this at

08:20.306 --> 08:23.976
This moment.
I think that i have to applaud

08:24.110 --> 08:26.578
Both of you guys because it's
such a cool interesting choice

08:26.713 --> 08:29.381
To have done this at this point
for you.

08:29.515 --> 08:32.650
I could never -- i like that it
was very unpredictable and i

08:32.784 --> 08:37.722
Applaud you for that, man.
You always go so hard at it.

08:37.857 --> 08:39.791
I love watching you.

08:39.926 --> 08:43.895
Your coach, blake shelton.
>> barrett, i literally feel

08:44.030 --> 08:47.599
Like i watched you and here's
the door to the finale and you

08:47.734 --> 08:52.771
Just kicked it in.
Like you're just -- it's crazy.

08:52.905 --> 08:56.808
I don't know that i ever worked
with anybody who gives more to

08:56.943 --> 09:01.346
Their performances than you do.
Let me just say, we better start

09:01.481 --> 09:04.449
Figuring out what you're going
to be doing next week, man.

09:04.584 --> 09:07.319

what you just did.

That's what you should be doing.

10:28.101 --> 10:34.940
>> lying there in the streets.
>> everything about this song is

10:35.074 --> 10:37.976

10:38.111 --> 10:41.279
To the table when this is all
over and i'm on my own.

10:41.414 --> 10:45.650

10:45.785 --> 10:48.019
Being on time.
>> stop thinking about it so

10:48.154 --> 10:50.455
Much.
You know when you sing at the

10:50.590 --> 10:53.792
Bowling alley when it was just
something you did for fun, try

10:53.926 --> 10:56.528
To get back to the person who
loves to just sing.

10:56.662 --> 10:59.898
>> each week i struggle with the
confidence thing.

here to coach me through that.

To be nervous about?
Like i don't understand.

16:16.348 --> 16:19.451
Right now i'm just seeing
confidence, and i say that

Because i felt like you
connected to the moment so well,

16:22.388 --> 16:24.789
You know, and that's really what
it takes to get through a

16:24.924 --> 16:28.193

At your self.
It was like you literally had no

16:43.309 --> 16:46.211
Nerves.
You were so calm.

16:46.345 --> 16:50.415
And i think my favorite
performance of you because you

16:50.549 --> 16:52.083
Sang so like under stated
tonight.

16:52.218 --> 16:56.755
I love that part of your voice
where you're not belting and

16:56.889 --> 17:01.059
You're just calm and gentle and
it's so warm and you're a really

17:01.193 --> 17:02.227
Good singer.
Wow.

crazy.

Something.
This girl, especially after what

17:32.424 --> 17:37.862

Beyond proud tonight.
You've conquered all of the

17:48.340 --> 17:50.141
Demons and you've stood up here.
You're 17 years old.

17:50.276 --> 17:52.877
I still can't believe that.
It shocked me.

17:53.012 --> 17:55.647
And every single week you get
better and better.

17:55.781 --> 17:59.184
And, man, vote this girl

19:20.966 --> 19:23.801
Terrified to start working on
it.

19:23.936 --> 19:26.571
>> i was shocked because the
song is so produced.

19:26.705 --> 19:31.576
>> the way that i have planned
to do it kind of feels on the

19:31.710 --> 19:34.879
Lyrics.
¶ i need love to feel strong ¶

19:35.014 --> 19:39.083
>> my personal journey on this
show really connects to the song

19:39.218 --> 19:41.686

I've always wanted to do.
>> that's so trippy.

19:45.791 --> 19:47.458
It almost becomes like an elton
john song.

19:47.593 --> 19:51.062
So classic.
I would want that version.

19:51.196 --> 19:55.700
>> but it's still very me.
>> jeffery is really clear on

19:55.834 --> 19:59.037

from your interviews, your

20:06.445 --> 20:07.979
Hands.
They're voting because they care

20:08.113 --> 20:09.380
About you.
Get closer to them.

20:09.515 --> 20:13.217
>> okay.
>> there are a lot of times when

20:13.352 --> 20:19.123
You're singing up, you look up,
have a worried look.

20:19.258 --> 20:21.059
If you can take a few lines and
get real with your facial

20:21.193 --> 20:26.297
Expressions.
Like i can't do that.

20:26.432 --> 20:29.701
>> gwen hasn't let me get away
with not sharing who i am.

20:29.835 --> 20:32.337
>> you're really being
believable it will just come out

20:32.471 --> 20:33.604
Naturally.
>> especially when the song is

20:33.739 --> 20:37.141
At the end.
I don't want to close up all the

20:37.276 --> 20:42.513
Time so i'm working on that.

32:08.299 --> 32:10.901
>> saved by america.
That's amazing.

32:11.036 --> 32:14.938
>> we're in the semi-finals, you
know, but next week is insane

32:15.073 --> 32:24.181
Because it's being cut down from
9 to 4.

32:24.315 --> 32:27.051
Your instincts are right on.
¶ amazing grace ¶

32:27.185 --> 32:29.687
>> everything that happened in
the past few days led to this

32:29.821 --> 32:33.057
Song.
I got saved.

32:33.191 --> 32:37.628
I'm here.
 My journey on "the voice" has

32:37.762 --> 32:41.231
Been extremely eye opening.
Gwen is like a mom to me.

32:41.366 --> 32:42.666
She helped me believe in myself
so i really don't want to go

32:42.801 --> 32:46.570
Home.
Sorry.

32:46.705 --> 32:50.107
>> this is actually quite a huge
thing that you've taken on.

32:50.241 --> 32:53.343
The good news is that you can do
it, you just have to map it out

32:53.478 --> 33:00.751
To make it build and do all the
things you want to do.

33:00.885 --> 33:04.054
Now in this song i'm noticing
you do this -- it's great but

33:04.189 --> 33:07.591
You're doing it a lot.
>> i wish my voice hadn't

33:07.726 --> 33:08.625
Changed over just the course of
this.

33:08.760 --> 33:11.895
>> has it?
>> yeah.

33:12.030 --> 33:16.266
>> i can't really wrap my head
around how young he is, and

33:16.401 --> 33:19.303
People at home don't realize how
much work it is to be on the

33:19.437 --> 33:22.940
Show.
It's learning songs, it's long

33:23.074 --> 33:28.178
Hours, it's a lot of pressure.
For a 15-year-old boy to get to

33:28.313 --> 33:32.316
The semi-final, he's a star now.
>> how are you doing?

33:32.450 --> 33:33.917
>> i'm starting to emotionally
fall apart.

33:34.052 --> 33:36.420
>> don't let your brain go
there.

33:36.554 --> 33:40.190
It's a waste of time.
You've risen up to be the star

33:40.325 --> 33:42.259
That you're meant to be.
>> thank you for telling me

33:42.393 --> 33:44.595
That.
>> i can't wait until monday.

33:44.729 --> 33:47.030
Say, bye.
I love you, bye.

33:47.165 --> 33:52.736
>> see ya.

>> you know, your journey on the
show has been the most unique

38:00.818 --> 38:06.356
And interesting because you came
on a kid and you're still a kid

38:06.491 --> 38:08.825
But you're that much more
seasoned and you've grown so

38:08.960 --> 38:12.696
Much.
And she's done so much to kind

38:12.830 --> 38:16.800
Of propel you forward.
And like your hair changed all

38:16.934 --> 38:20.604
The time, your song choices were
crazy.

38:20.738 --> 38:26.276
You didn't ever really find one
thing with but you kind of prov

38:26.411 --> 38:28.478
Everybody that you could do
everything.

38:28.613 --> 38:32.482
You have to be so happy with
every single thing, this being

38:32.617 --> 38:33.617
Like the exclamation point
tonight.

38:33.751 --> 38:36.386
Great job.
>> carson: Pharrell.

38:36.521 --> 38:39.790
>> hey, man.
As you were singing i was

38:39.924 --> 38:42.859
Thinking to myself, man, this
kid is giving so much hope to

38:42.994 --> 38:46.463
Kids who are like 10 years old,
11 years old and 12.

38:46.597 --> 38:50.367
You know, because the thing is,
your voice has changed but you

38:50.501 --> 38:55.272
Still have this like -- i can
still see you, like there's a

38:55.406 --> 38:58.975
Kid there and i think like to be
doing what you're doing live on

38:59.110 --> 39:01.845
Television in front of the
nation, you're like shining the

39:01.979 --> 39:04.748
Light for a lot of kids and
you're inspiring them.

39:04.882 --> 39:09.753
There's a lot of kids watching
you now, like i can do that

39:09.887 --> 39:14.224
Because braiden just did it.
>> thank you.

39:14.358 --> 39:18.261
>> carson: Gwen stefani.
>> braiden sunshine, wow.

39:18.396 --> 39:21.731
I mean, to watch you get up
there and sing a song that -- he

39:21.866 --> 39:25.702
Was like convinced that this was
like meant to be and he had this

39:25.837 --> 39:29.439
Like calling to do this song.
And the way you did it, how

39:29.574 --> 39:32.609
Beautifully you did it, the tone
in your voice and just how you

39:32.743 --> 39:35.178
Held back in the beginning and
then you just went all the way

39:35.313 --> 39:39.549
There.
It was so spiritual and so

39:39.684 --> 39:43.386
Beautiful and vote for this guy.
Obviously he's 15 years old.

39:43.521 --> 39:45.288
He needs to still be on the
show.

39:45.423 --> 39:48.959

40:36.574 --> 40:40.710
All the way to the end.
We're going to continue with

Teen blake's hearthrob showing
his sense stiff side with a

40:44.615 --> 40:48.084
Miley cyrus song.
Here's more from zach seabaugh.

40:48.219 --> 40:50.320
>> congratulations, buddy.
>> thank you.

40:50.454 --> 40:52.956

>> i'm over there.
¶ i've got to be cool ¶

40:57.528 --> 41:02.065
>> i looked over at you.
>> as soon as i did it, girls

41:02.200 --> 41:05.669
Over here, then i looked back at
gwen.

41:05.803 --> 41:08.071
She was like, yes, she's doing
it.

41:08.206 --> 41:09.072
>> but now we're getting
serious.

41:09.207 --> 41:11.174
>> yeah.
>> this is your theme song,

41:11.309 --> 41:14.878
Right?
>> it really is.

41:15.012 --> 41:18.848
>> you think of the lyrics of
this song, climbing this

41:18.983 --> 41:20.717
Mountain, having all of these
hardships, going to the other

41:20.851 --> 41:23.553
Side.
It's one big dream come true.

41:23.688 --> 41:26.856
It's a very important message
that i think everyone can relate

41:26.991 --> 41:30.093
To.
>> you know what, zach, i think

41:30.228 --> 41:32.896
You need to go there right now.
This is it.

41:33.030 --> 41:37.601
You've got to swing for the
fence.

41:37.735 --> 41:39.703
 My concern is the pocket is way
behind.

41:39.837 --> 41:42.239
There's nothing wrong with this
song, standing there george

41:42.373 --> 41:44.541
Straight.
>> george straight has a

41:44.675 --> 41:47.811
Reputation of standing in front
of the microphone, playing his

41:47.945 --> 41:50.280
Guitar and singing.
It's becoming a theme.

41:50.414 --> 41:54.251
Are you going to george straight
it or walking around, rascall

41:54.385 --> 41:57.787
Flatts it.
>> going to be an uphill battle.

41:57.922 --> 42:02.125
>> yeah!
>> the first time i sang for a

42:02.260 --> 42:03.927
Big crowd was at the 9/11
memorial day that my dad had

42:04.061 --> 42:07.430
Actually organized.
I guess you could say, i was

42:07.565 --> 42:10.066
Overcome by the message of the
music.

42:10.201 --> 42:13.937
Really at that moment i realized
the power of the music.

42:14.071 --> 42:16.606
Now i hope that with this song i
can do the same thing, really

42:16.741 --> 42:17.974
Get the message across.
>> dad?

42:18.109 --> 42:20.477
>> yeah.
>> doesn't he look like me?

42:20.611 --> 42:23.980
>> oh, identical.
This kid's amazing, man.

42:24.115 --> 42:26.049
>> been fun to watch him grow on
the show.

42:26.183 --> 42:29.586
You've done a great job with
him.

42:29.720 --> 42:31.788
>> i think this is going to be a
big opportunity for zach.

42:31.922 --> 42:36.092
Vocally it pushes him further
than he's ever been pushed

42:36.227 --> 42:41.898
Before this season.
>> carson: With "the climb"

In there?
What is happening?

46:43.607 --> 46:47.944
That was so good.
Like that's one of my favorite

46:48.078 --> 46:51.548
Songs ever, and to see you do a
song like that at this point in

46:51.682 --> 46:56.152

49:01.512 --> 49:04.514
Lightheartedness of that song.
>> how did you hear of that

49:04.648 --> 49:06.182
Song?
You're 16.

49:06.316 --> 49:10.520
>> i do the song because it
makes me happy.

49:10.654 --> 49:13.189
It was the most simple thing i
had done.

49:13.323 --> 49:15.558
This week the semi-finals are a
big deal and this song needs to

49:15.693 --> 49:21.731
Be a big deal.
¶

49:21.865 --> 49:26.369
>> this is going to be a really
special performance.

49:26.503 --> 49:30.173
Madi continues to just like love
the topography.

49:30.307 --> 49:31.941
There was more comfort in the
vocals when you were playing

49:32.076 --> 49:35.344
Just now.
>> it takes me back playing

49:35.479 --> 49:37.346
Those shows where no one is
listening.

49:37.481 --> 49:40.149
I would play that song and it
would just be for me.

49:40.284 --> 49:43.653
>> cool.
You be so he focused on the

49:43.787 --> 49:45.121
Music and don't let the stuff
get to you.

49:45.255 --> 49:48.791
How do you do it?
>> i used to be really closed

49:48.926 --> 49:53.696
Off and i never really trusted
anyone with my art but then i

49:53.831 --> 49:58.534
Would do the show an
thing is to get better,

49:58.669 --> 50:01.471
Collaborate, the band, you
obviously.

50:01.605 --> 50:04.407
A lot of that just has to do
with being open.

50:04.541 --> 50:07.410
It's impossible not to become a
better version of yourself when

50:07.544 --> 50:09.779
All of these people are cheering
you on and one of those people

50:09.913 --> 50:10.780
In particular is pharrell
williams.

50:10.914 --> 50:13.950
¶
¶

50:14.084 --> 50:17.420
>> whew, yeah.
>> he loves the little

50:17.554 --> 50:20.022
Intricacies of my voice that i
thought were kind of flaws.

50:20.157 --> 50:22.892
>> make sure you put that in
there.

50:23.026 --> 50:25.461
The background, can they do like
three part harmony?

50:25.596 --> 50:27.630
That will be amazing.
They'll be like the little birds

50:27.765 --> 50:29.932
Behind you.
>> do you like it?

50:30.067 --> 50:32.168
>> love it.
You sound amazing.

50:32.302 --> 50:37.740
>> you don't have to fan me.
>> i've got to.

50:37.875 --> 50:43.246
I got to make sure you're cool.

¶ big girls do cry ¶

up ¶

53:25.676 --> 53:30.746
¶ hope that she would call my
bluff ¶

53:30.881 --> 53:41.691

54:27.571 --> 54:32.041
And the last remaining artist
for pharrell.

54:32.175 --> 54:33.542
>> good job, madi.
Good job.

54:33.677 --> 54:37.847
Love it.
Look at that.

54:37.981 --> 54:44.854
Isn't that great?
[ cheers and applause ]

54:44.988 --> 54:48.324
>> carson: Every time you sing
"big girls don't cry" your dad

54:48.458 --> 54:51.360
Started to cry.
>> dad does cry.

54:51.495 --> 54:53.662
>> carson: Adam levine, what did
you think of that?

54:53.797 --> 54:56.932
>> i think first of all, i
really wanted to be hanging out

54:57.067 --> 55:00.603
At that place.
It was so serene, beautiful,

55:00.737 --> 55:02.972
Romantic, that was a really cool
set.

55:03.106 --> 55:05.074
I actually want to hang there.
Then i was listening to your

55:05.208 --> 55:07.743
Vocal.
Wow, this is the most different

55:07.878 --> 55:11.480
Thing i've ever heard on the
show because it's so different.

55:11.615 --> 55:14.750
And i love the fact that it was
where it was in the season

55:14.885 --> 55:16.685
Because, you know, everyone is
doing a million different

55:16.820 --> 55:19.722
Things.
This was very unexpected.

55:19.856 --> 55:21.357
I think that's the coolest,
coolest thing about it.

55:21.491 --> 55:24.126
Awesome.
>> carson: Blake?

55:24.261 --> 55:29.999
>> thank you so much.
>> man, i literally felt like i

55:30.133 --> 55:34.437
Was watching like a -- like a
disney movie or something right

55:34.571 --> 55:36.972
Then, but like not something
live.

55:37.107 --> 55:44.146
It was too perfect to be live.
That was too perfect to be live.

55:44.281 --> 55:47.149
[ cheers and applause ]
what?

55:47.284 --> 55:52.555
So it's going to be my three in
the finale and you, i guess.

55:52.689 --> 55:54.957
>> carson: Madi, what does coach
pharrell have to say?

55:55.092 --> 55:56.959
>> i couldn't sit down.
Tried to sit down a couple of

55:57.094 --> 55:58.694
Times.
It's mainly because that

55:58.829 --> 56:06.635
Production was amazing and --
[ cheers and applause ]

56:06.770 --> 56:10.673
>> and you sang it like you're
prepared for broadway or film,

56:10.807 --> 56:14.343
And then i have to remind myself
that you're 16 years old so, i

56:14.478 --> 56:17.246
Mean, we have to figure out how
that happens.

56:17.380 --> 56:22.184
But like -- dude, you were like
an actress.

56:22.319 --> 56:28.190
>> too perfect to be live!
>> that was insane.

56:28.325 --> 56:33.996
And the crazy thing is like --
actually, you got your dad --

56:34.131 --> 56:37.166
The song should be called big
guys do cry because you've got

56:37.300 --> 56:42.204
Your dad crying down there.
And like last but not least,

56:42.339 --> 56:45.875
America needs to vote madi davis
through.

56:46.009 --> 56:49.578
[ cheers and applause ]

Of our perform maps from the

>> headed to rehearsal with
blake and i'm going to do a

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:30.592
Dolly parton song.
It makes me really nervous to do

01:01:30.727 --> 01:01:32.961
This song because she's going to
be here.

01:01:33.096 --> 01:01:36.298
Like i'm speechless right now.
>> when brad paisley was here

01:01:36.433 --> 01:01:40.969
Brad was saying you reminded him
of a young dolly parton.

01:01:41.104 --> 01:01:44.273
Only certain artists can blend
country, east tennessee blue

01:01:44.407 --> 01:01:48.177
Grass sound.
This would be the perfect one.

¶ jumping in the shower and the
blood starts pumping ¶

01:01:55.652 --> 01:01:58.187
>> dolly parton represents the
type of artist that i want to

01:01:58.321 --> 01:02:01.690
Be.
She can rip at your heart

01:02:01.825 --> 01:02:04.827
Whenever she is singing a sad
love song.

01:02:04.961 --> 01:02:07.463
She's from my same area in east
tennessee.

01:02:07.597 --> 01:02:10.466
I've grown up going to
dollywood.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.801
I remember getting dolly parton
cds from christmas.

01:02:12.936 --> 01:02:14.736
>> what do you think when you
perform?

01:02:14.871 --> 01:02:18.340
>> i want to have the moment
where i can command the stage

01:02:18.475 --> 01:02:20.609
And be sassy.
That is having so much fun.

01:02:20.743 --> 01:02:23.512
>> it's your turn.
>> you need to teach me your

01:02:23.646 --> 01:02:27.082
Moves.

01:02:27.217 --> 01:02:31.386
Awkward.
Don't do that

¶ 9 to 5, for service and
devotion ¶

01:02:33.556 --> 01:02:36.024
>> the message of this song is
about hard work.

01:02:36.159 --> 01:02:37.993
 My first working experience was
with my dad.

01:02:38.127 --> 01:02:42.064
When he was younger he fell and
broke his back and the doctors

01:02:42.198 --> 01:02:43.632
Told him that he would never
walk.

01:02:43.766 --> 01:02:46.335
 My dad never gave up.
He started walking again.

01:02:46.469 --> 01:02:50.372
He taught me that it means so
much to work hard and earn what

01:02:50.507 --> 01:02:53.609
You have.
>> the only thing is learning

01:02:53.743 --> 01:02:57.112
Where to breathe on this.
There's so much going on, like

01:02:57.247 --> 01:03:00.215
Lyrically.
I do think you can work the

01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:02.618
Stage, the band is up here, you
have some girl power with the

01:03:02.752 --> 01:03:05.854
Backup singers.
I want the focus to be on how

01:03:05.989 --> 01:03:10.025
Good you sound.
The song was meant for you.

01:03:10.159 --> 01:03:14.830
Will you do me one fwafr, will
you wear cowboy boots for it?

01:03:14.964 --> 01:03:19.201
>> when am i not wearing them.

That vocal was crazy.
I don't understand how you can

Sing that perfect.
That is such a hard song to

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:42.030
Sing, and it was so good.
But my favorite thing that i

Saw, you did this last time,
too.

01:07:46.202 --> 01:07:47.369

You're going to make somebody so
much money.

01:08:18.868 --> 01:08:20.801

Hello.

01:09:29.906 --> 01:09:31.305
The little girl in me is
breaking out.

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:34.776
>> thinking back to the day that
i decided to audition to this

01:09:34.911 --> 01:09:39.281
Moment.
The top nine of season nine.

01:09:39.415 --> 01:09:49.057
Just really realizing what a
blessing this has been and

01:09:49.191 --> 01:09:54.194
Just -- just being thankful.
¶ there's nothing that i

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:59.567
Wouldn't do ¶
¶ to make you feel my love ¶

01:09:59.702 --> 01:10:03.071
>> talk about this song.
>> i just really wanted to play

01:10:03.205 --> 01:10:05.407
A song that was straight from
the heart to the audience.

01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:07.542
>> good.
Good time for a heart felt

01:10:07.677 --> 01:10:09.110
Moment.
>> yeah.

01:10:09.245 --> 01:10:13.481
>> you've done a lot of really
cool things.

01:10:13.616 --> 01:10:16.384
You have to show them the
songwriter side of yourself.

01:10:16.519 --> 01:10:21.089
>> yeah.
>> everyone this week is going

01:10:21.223 --> 01:10:24.960
To be doing big, knockdown drag
out songs.

01:10:25.094 --> 01:10:28.396
This is amy's window not to do
that.

01:10:28.531 --> 01:10:30.966
This is her chance to have an
emotional raw moment.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.568
Tweak the structure of it.
Imagine the nora jones record,

01:10:33.703 --> 01:10:37.472
Very, very simple.
And i think that for you, amy,

01:10:37.606 --> 01:10:41.042
You need to open up a bit
towards the end.

01:10:41.177 --> 01:10:48.383
>> yeah.
>> ¶ to make you feel my love ¶

01:10:48.517 --> 01:10:51.019
Really put everything out there
on the line.

>> i want to go onto the finale
and this week i just want to be

01:10:54.557 --> 01:10:59.594
As real as possible.
I just want to be me.

>> it's time to show them i want
to be through to the end of it.

01:11:02.598 --> 01:11:07.602
As long as you're totally
connected, it's going to be

01:11:07.737 --> 01:11:08.937
Beautiful.

What did you think?
>> sang that the brooklyn way.

01:15:08.177 --> 01:15:14.315
That was -- that was nice.
Your voice seems like it's made,

01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:17.852
You know, what beautiful clouds
are made of, you know.

01:15:17.987 --> 01:15:21.589
It seemed like when you sang
this now like the stars would

01:15:21.724 --> 01:15:25.260
Come out to assist that moment.
That was beautiful, it was

01:15:25.394 --> 01:15:29.564
Light, and honestly with all the
crazy things going on in the

01:15:29.698 --> 01:15:33.134
World, like we need those crazy
people to hear that voice, to

01:15:33.269 --> 01:15:36.304
See some clarity and see some
good because that's what your

01:15:36.438 --> 01:15:41.209
Voice ignites.
It ignites like somebody wanting

01:15:41.343 --> 01:15:43.211
To do the right thing.

What we wanted to do tonight,
and if you guys noticed in here,

01:15:51.253 --> 01:15:53.721
Everybody watching at home, too,
this room completely froze and

01:15:53.856 --> 01:15:56.357
Stopped.
And all.

01:15:56.492 --> 01:15:59.460
Energy was focused on you, and
i'm sure that was really intense

01:15:59.595 --> 01:16:01.596
To feel.
We set out to create a different

01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:03.698
Kind of moment.
There are so many different ways

01:16:03.832 --> 01:16:06.701
To sing.
Especially on this show it's

01:16:06.835 --> 01:16:10.138
Very big and over the top all
the time, but what's special

01:16:10.272 --> 01:16:15.543
About you, amy, is that you do
it in a way that is completely

01:16:15.678 --> 01:16:18.546
Different and refreshingly raw,
and honest, and beautiful.

01:16:18.681 --> 01:16:20.581
As far as that's concerned, do
you that better than anybody on

01:16:20.716 --> 01:16:24.018
The show.
I am so proud of you.

With the choir.
It would be more of a moment.

When he lets go, he's
ridiculous.

01:18:18.167 --> 01:18:19.567
He's like kobe bryant, michael
jordan, lebron james of "the

01:18:19.701 --> 01:18:24.405
Voice."
