WEBVTT

00:01.004 --> 00:02.249
<i>Previously on</i> Bones...

00:02.274 --> 00:04.091
Paris real estate again, huh?

00:04.290 --> 00:08.225
It's ours. We are
moving to Paris.

00:09.662 --> 00:12.196
I'm here to collect
on a debt-- $30,000.

00:12.231 --> 00:15.384
Jimmy, your bookie, came here.
I paid him everything you owe.

00:15.408 --> 00:18.435
It was just a mistake, all right? Look,
I made one bet, that was it.

00:18.471 --> 00:20.371
I need you to leave.

00:20.406 --> 00:21.939
My name is Seeley,
and I have a gambling addiction.

00:21.974 --> 00:23.340
Welcome, Seeley.

00:23.376 --> 00:25.776
<i>I have faith in you, Booth.</i>

00:25.811 --> 00:31.315
And I think you should
stay the night with me.

00:39.925 --> 00:42.893
Hi, Booth.
Hey, Bones. What is all this?

00:42.928 --> 00:44.962
Oh. Uh...

00:44.997 --> 00:46.997
those are job offers
I've received.

00:47.033 --> 00:50.734
Uh, proposals to run
research facilities,

00:50.770 --> 00:52.236
university programs.

00:52.271 --> 00:54.305
All this happened when
I was out of the house?

00:54.340 --> 00:56.206
Well, I've been getting
job offers for years.

00:56.242 --> 00:58.776
You know that.
So have you.

00:58.811 --> 01:01.345
Okay, but you organized
all of them so neatly,

01:01.380 --> 01:03.480
and you put little
Post-its on everything.

01:03.516 --> 01:04.915
Look at this.
"Definitely consider.

01:04.950 --> 01:06.684
Great potential.
Total autonomy."

01:06.719 --> 01:08.819
All right, well, oh,
but in that case, I don't think

01:08.854 --> 01:11.588
I want to be constricted
by an Ivy League setting.

01:11.624 --> 01:14.124
Right, I mean, look,
I know that I... I screwed up

01:14.160 --> 01:15.826
with the gambling
and everything,

01:15.861 --> 01:17.895
and I'm-I'm working
hard on that and all, but

01:17.942 --> 01:21.176
these are the types of decisions
that we deal with

01:21.206 --> 01:23.539
and-and talk about, you
know, together as a team.

01:23.575 --> 01:27.464
You were going to leave the FBI
last year and move to Europe.

01:27.465 --> 01:29.745
You remember how great
you felt about that?

01:29.746 --> 01:30.698
There's a big difference.
You know,

01:30.699 --> 01:32.342
I discussed that
before I did anything.

01:32.343 --> 01:33.809
And we'll discuss this.

01:33.844 --> 01:37.345
I've compiled all
of your job offers, too.

01:37.381 --> 01:40.549
You loved the idea
of working at the NSA facility

01:40.584 --> 01:43.652
in Kansas,
and there's a university there.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.420
This is about Angela and Hodgins

01:45.455 --> 01:47.289
moving to Paris,
isn't it?

01:47.324 --> 01:49.724
No, Booth, this is about us.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.126
We've been through a lot.

01:51.161 --> 01:53.895
Your gambling,
being in jail,

01:53.931 --> 01:55.864
shot. I...

01:55.899 --> 01:57.365
The new baby.

01:58.735 --> 02:01.469
Don't you think
we might need a change?

02:07.277 --> 02:10.044
Booth.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.446
Yeah. Wait,
wait, wait. Okay.

02:11.481 --> 02:13.582
Where? All right.

02:13.617 --> 02:14.950
Look, we're-we're on our way.

02:14.985 --> 02:17.152
There's a body found
at Adam's Park.

02:17.187 --> 02:18.787
Okay, I'll call Max

02:18.822 --> 02:21.623
and have him take Christine to preschool.
Right.

02:21.658 --> 02:23.792
Hey, Bones, this is what we do.

02:23.827 --> 02:26.161
I know.

02:26.196 --> 02:29.297
For now.

02:33.971 --> 02:35.604
Look, this is important
work, all right?

02:35.639 --> 02:38.039
Or don't you think so anymore?
Of course I think so,

02:38.075 --> 02:39.374
but there are other
important things

02:39.409 --> 02:41.509
we could do that
won't get us killed.

02:41.545 --> 02:43.878
Okay, look,no one's getting killed.
That's what you always say

02:43.914 --> 02:45.380
before the
shooting starts.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.248
Hey, Whoa! Oh, God!

02:47.284 --> 02:48.850
What the hell
happened here?

02:48.885 --> 02:51.620
Well, the skin was neatly flayed
to attract carrion.

02:51.655 --> 02:55.657
Oh, extreme animal predation,
but no observable bite marks.

02:55.692 --> 02:57.892
Because this wasn't

02:57.928 --> 02:59.928
rats or coyotes
or raccoons.

02:59.963 --> 03:03.264
Vultures.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.367
Yup, that's right.
What are you still doing here, bug boy?

03:05.402 --> 03:07.135
I thought you were
moving to Paris.

03:07.170 --> 03:09.270
Aren't I entitled
to a swan song?

03:09.306 --> 03:11.906
The removal of the skin,
the placement of the body.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.442
This is precise work.
Almost as good as my work.

03:14.478 --> 03:17.112
Almost.
The height of the nasal bridge

03:17.147 --> 03:19.147
indicates the
victim was male.

03:19.182 --> 03:21.316
The depth of the sternal
rib endings

03:21.351 --> 03:23.952
indicates he was
in his mid-20s.

03:23.987 --> 03:25.854
Well, his body was posed.

03:25.889 --> 03:29.557
Must be some kind of a message.
In ancient Egypt, grave robbers

03:29.593 --> 03:33.261
were flayed, impaled, and
their hands were severed.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.163
Well, this obelisk
is Egyptian.

03:35.198 --> 03:36.898
Look, I'm just
gonna say it.

03:36.933 --> 03:38.800
Okay, last time
we saw something like this...

03:38.835 --> 03:40.201
It was Pelant.
Pelant.

03:40.237 --> 03:41.636
Pelant is dead.

03:41.672 --> 03:43.538
I examined his remains.
We all did.

03:43.573 --> 03:44.839
Someone as brilliant as Pelant

03:44.875 --> 03:46.374
with all the money
he stole from you.

03:46.410 --> 03:47.676
He probably planned
for the future.

03:47.711 --> 03:49.244
So someone took
over his work?

03:49.279 --> 03:51.112
Okay, look, it
wasn't work, okay?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.747
Pelant was a killer,
nothing more.

03:52.783 --> 03:54.215
Guys, there's...

03:54.251 --> 03:56.785
there's something
in his throat.

03:58.722 --> 04:00.789
Whoa.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.158
Flower.

04:03.193 --> 04:05.160
Flower. Exactly what
Pelant used to use

04:05.195 --> 04:06.461
to send a message.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.029
Still have any doubt
this has to do with him?

04:08.065 --> 04:09.931
Flowers had specific messages.

04:09.966 --> 04:12.367
What about this one?
This is a chiranthodendron.

04:12.402 --> 04:14.869
It means "be warned."

of the lungs

04:57.634 --> 04:59.835
Should be enough for

04:59.870 --> 05:02.938
There's no hemorrhagic
staining on the rib incisions,

05:02.973 --> 05:05.374
indicating the damage
was postmortem.

05:05.409 --> 05:06.942
So he was

05:06.977 --> 05:09.811
flayed and cut in order
to fit onto the obelisk.

05:09.847 --> 05:11.513
Similar to how Pelant killed

05:11.548 --> 05:14.149
and placed Agent Flynn
on the rock.

05:14.184 --> 05:17.018
So we're talking about a copycat.
Or a devotee.

05:17.054 --> 05:19.388
You'll need to work faster
on that reconstruction,

05:19.423 --> 05:22.224
Dr. Edison.
I'm trying my best, but I'm no Angela.

05:22.259 --> 05:23.625
Well, no one is.

05:23.660 --> 05:25.427
Oh, you don't have
to do that, Angela.

05:25.462 --> 05:27.929
Well, we don't leave until
next week, and if this is

05:27.965 --> 05:29.431
somehow related
to Pelant...

05:29.466 --> 05:31.299
Thank you.

05:31.335 --> 05:33.735
Honestly, I can't bear to see
something done this badly.

05:33.771 --> 05:35.804
I'm insulted
and yet grateful.

05:35.839 --> 05:37.372
Need an extra pair of hands?

05:37.408 --> 05:38.807
I was helping

05:38.842 --> 05:41.009
Hodgins pack up, and
Pelant was mentioned.

05:41.044 --> 05:43.011
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Bray.

05:43.046 --> 05:46.314
The victim is
in his late 20s, but

05:46.350 --> 05:49.251
the iliac crest is
abnormally thin.

05:49.286 --> 05:51.319
Most likely a sign
of osteomalacia.

05:51.355 --> 05:53.655
Indicating
a Vitamin D deficiency.

05:53.690 --> 05:55.524
Could be a lack of
sunlight, poor diet.

05:55.559 --> 05:57.826
From the look of his
musculature, I'd say both.

05:57.861 --> 05:59.795
I don't think our victim
got outside much.

05:59.830 --> 06:03.231
A shut-in.
Or someone held him captive.

06:04.334 --> 06:05.801
<i>I spent all night</i>

06:05.836 --> 06:07.636
<i>going over the Pelant files.</i>

06:07.671 --> 06:10.071
I can't believe this guy stalked
your family for three years.

06:10.073 --> 06:11.506
I can't believe

06:11.542 --> 06:13.208
somebody wants to keep
this guy's memory alive.

06:13.243 --> 06:15.210
Are you sure you're up
for dealing with Pelant again?

06:15.245 --> 06:17.446
I got a job to do, Aubrey.
Let's not make it

06:17.481 --> 06:19.080
more complicated, all right?
I'm just saying,

06:19.116 --> 06:21.750
I can take the lead on this
if it hits too close to home.

06:21.785 --> 06:23.652
You know, you and Dr. B
just got back together.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.554
And I really, really appreciate
that, but, you know,

06:25.589 --> 06:27.088
if someone's coming
after me and my family,

06:27.124 --> 06:30.025
I'm the guy who's
gonna take him out.

06:30.060 --> 06:33.728
Seeley Booth. It does a body
good to see you bright-eyed,

06:33.764 --> 06:35.297
bushy-tailed and back
in the peak of health again.

06:35.332 --> 06:37.098
Good to see you,
too, Caroline.

06:37.134 --> 06:39.901
Now, how about you gentlemen
walk me through what you have?

06:39.937 --> 06:42.604
Well, it was a warning, the
kind that Pelant used to give.

06:42.639 --> 06:44.272
Remember that guy?

06:44.308 --> 06:45.740
A warning about what,
and to who,<i> Cher?</i>

06:45.776 --> 06:47.176
Could be as simple as money.

06:47.177 --> 06:49.411
Hodgins' money was
never recovered.

06:49.446 --> 06:50.912
$4.6 billion.

06:50.948 --> 06:53.415
That's a lot of cash
that people would kill for.

06:53.450 --> 06:56.151
Hmm.

06:56.186 --> 06:57.586
You get an ID yet?

06:57.621 --> 06:59.421
Aren't you supposed
to be packing?

06:59.456 --> 07:02.290
He won't finish it
until we solve this case.

07:02.326 --> 07:03.758
Our flight's not
until next week.

07:03.794 --> 07:05.560
Okay, then I'll take
what I can get.

07:05.596 --> 07:07.829
Have you found any
probative particulates?

07:07.865 --> 07:09.264
Nice alliteration.

07:09.299 --> 07:11.466
Well, just traces
of gluten, cheese

07:11.502 --> 07:14.002
and tomato.
Huh. Pizza?

07:14.037 --> 07:15.971
Yeah. Yeah, so we know
what he liked to eat,

07:16.006 --> 07:18.006
just not where
he was killed or how.

07:19.977 --> 07:21.877
Ooh. Okay, got a match.

07:21.912 --> 07:23.345
"Franklin Holt.

07:23.380 --> 07:26.114
Independent
computer consultant."

07:26.149 --> 07:29.150
Computers and Pelant.
I don't like this.

07:29.186 --> 07:31.453
Still can't believe you used
to do this with Dr. Brennan.

07:31.488 --> 07:33.388
It's so dangerous.
Bones isn't afraid of anything,

07:33.423 --> 07:34.923
you know, but now
that she's pregnant...

07:36.994 --> 07:39.361
Didn't the landlord say
that Holt lived alone?

07:39.396 --> 07:41.363
She did.

07:48.438 --> 07:50.372
There's blood
on the wall, Booth,

07:50.407 --> 07:51.840
and a woman inside.

07:51.875 --> 07:53.942
That's a lot of blood.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.684
FBI. Come out
with your hands up.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:11.328 --> 08:14.863
All right, let's go.
Get up. Up you go. Huh?

08:14.898 --> 08:17.232
What part of "FBI" did you not
understand? You see that? FBI.

08:17.267 --> 08:18.800
Anyone can say "FBI."

08:18.835 --> 08:21.403
What are you doing here?
Looking for Franklin.

08:21.438 --> 08:23.438
And then I saw the blood.
I was calling 911.

08:23.473 --> 08:25.307
What happened to him?
Where is he?

08:25.342 --> 08:26.841
First of all, who the hell are you?
Leelah.

08:26.877 --> 08:28.376
Leelah Strawn.

08:28.412 --> 08:30.378
Franklin and me were going out,
and I didn't hear

08:30.414 --> 08:32.547
from him for a couple of days,
so I-I came over.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.015
What happened?

08:34.051 --> 08:35.482
He's been murdered.

08:35.519 --> 08:38.053
Franklin?
Yeah.

08:38.087 --> 08:40.087
Oh, God.
So, uh,

08:40.123 --> 08:42.029
did he have any threats
against him recently?

08:42.053 --> 08:42.792
Franklin?

08:42.793 --> 08:44.259
Not-not that he told me.

08:44.294 --> 08:46.394
I mean, he barely saw anyone.

08:46.430 --> 08:49.831
He was an IT guy,
but he did everything from here.

08:49.866 --> 08:51.633
I'll call the squints.

08:51.668 --> 08:53.535
Need to sweep the house
for evidence.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.876
Well, I was right
about the pizza.

09:01.912 --> 09:04.145
Well, Booth said
there was a struggle.

09:04.181 --> 09:06.014
He was clearly right about that.

09:06.049 --> 09:08.516
Well, there's blood and tissue
all over the room, so I concur.

09:08.552 --> 09:10.051
Every hard drive

09:10.087 --> 09:12.354
is gone,
and there are no thumb drives

09:12.389 --> 09:14.389
or SD cards either.
He was cleaned out.

09:14.424 --> 09:17.325
So he must have been killed for
information on these computers.

09:17.361 --> 09:19.661
What should we take back
to the lab, Dr. Saroyan?

09:19.696 --> 09:21.396
- Oh.
- Everything.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.700
<i>Look, I d-- I don't know about</i>

09:25.736 --> 09:27.335
all this, okay?
Franklin and me--

09:27.371 --> 09:29.838
we met online because we
both liked <i> Call of Duty.</i>

09:29.873 --> 09:32.307
We'd get together at
his place, order pizza,

09:32.342 --> 09:34.075
play and...

09:34.111 --> 09:37.178
hook up.
He ever mention someone named Pelant?

09:37.214 --> 09:39.314
Is that the guy
at that investment place?

09:39.349 --> 09:40.982
What investment place?

09:41.018 --> 09:43.718
Kevin Dunlop Investments,
I think it was called.

09:43.754 --> 09:46.488
The IT guy there--
Franklin had him fired,

09:46.523 --> 09:48.390
so he kept threatening him
online.

09:48.425 --> 09:51.459
But threats like that--
they're usually just noise,

09:51.495 --> 09:52.927
right?

09:52.963 --> 09:54.963
Maybe not this time.

09:58.502 --> 10:00.368
Hi.

10:00.404 --> 10:02.549
Hi. I thought you were
coming home for dinner.

10:02.573 --> 10:03.272
Well, I left work.

10:03.273 --> 10:06.274
I... You know, I had to get out
and, uh, go for a walk.

10:06.309 --> 10:08.176
It's just, I lost track of time.

10:08.211 --> 10:10.345
The case?

10:10.380 --> 10:11.680
Yeah. Yup.

10:11.715 --> 10:14.616
I heard the
girlfriend was right.

10:14.651 --> 10:18.153
The victim was brought
in to Dunlop Investments

10:18.188 --> 10:19.654
to check out
the computer security.

10:19.690 --> 10:21.322
Yeah, he found a lot

10:21.358 --> 10:24.693
of holes in the system, so
Dunlop ended up firing the head

10:24.728 --> 10:27.028
of security,
Owen Ellickson.

10:27.064 --> 10:29.297
Listen, Bones, I got to...

10:29.332 --> 10:30.832
We have to talk.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.600
I-I just feel like...

10:32.636 --> 10:35.470
Look, I know that we're
in the middle of a case here

10:35.505 --> 10:38.039
and everything, but what you
were saying earlier...

10:40.744 --> 10:42.944
I just, uh...

10:42.979 --> 10:44.879
It's right.

10:44.915 --> 10:47.115
I'm...

10:47.150 --> 10:50.351
This is my last case.

10:50.387 --> 10:52.921
Are you sure, Booth?
Yeah.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.757
You know what? I made some
really bad choices recently,

10:55.792 --> 10:57.525
but this one feels really good.

10:57.561 --> 10:59.594
It just feels right.

10:59.629 --> 11:02.530
You could take the job
at the NSA

11:02.566 --> 11:04.666
and I could take over
the department at Fulton.

11:04.701 --> 11:07.602
They'd give me unlimited funds.

11:07.637 --> 11:10.605
Or we could just have a baby
and live our lives

11:10.640 --> 11:13.108
and be happy.

11:13.143 --> 11:16.144
That sounds so good.
Right?

11:16.179 --> 11:18.665
But I don't want you to do
anything that you don't...

11:18.666 --> 11:21.150
No, I want to, I do.

11:21.184 --> 11:23.985
It's Aubrey. Yeah?

11:24.020 --> 11:25.520
Right, okay.

11:25.555 --> 11:27.989
Got it.
He found Ellickson.

11:33.597 --> 11:35.296
<i>Franklin Holt was trying</i>
<i>to destroy me.</i>

11:35.332 --> 11:37.232
But I didn't kill him.
I'm just

11:37.267 --> 11:39.100
a IT guy. Guys like me
don't kill people.

11:39.135 --> 11:42.637
Christopher Pelant was
once just an IT guy.

11:42.672 --> 11:45.640
Pelant? What does Pelant
have to do with me?

11:45.675 --> 11:47.609
Judging by your
computer, you seemed

11:47.644 --> 11:50.778
a little obsessed with him. We
found a history of his hacks,

11:50.814 --> 11:53.681
details of his murders.
Very creepy stuff.

11:53.717 --> 11:55.216
The guy
might have been evil,

11:55.252 --> 11:56.851
but he was a genius.

11:56.886 --> 11:59.854
$4 billion gone
without leaving a trace?

11:59.889 --> 12:01.823
You've got to admit--
that's pretty awesome.

12:01.858 --> 12:04.259
Sounds like you want to keep
his awesome work alive.

12:04.294 --> 12:06.628
If you mean find out
how he did it, sure.

12:06.663 --> 12:08.630
Having a skill like that--
I could write my own ticket.

12:08.665 --> 12:12.333
So how exactly did
Holt get you fired?

12:12.369 --> 12:14.736
He broke into a server
at Dunlop Investments

12:14.771 --> 12:16.204
and said it was my fault

12:16.239 --> 12:17.872
because I'd made them
vulnerable,

12:17.907 --> 12:19.974
which was crap.
That server?

12:20.010 --> 12:21.843
Dunlop wouldn't
let me touch it.

12:21.878 --> 12:23.745
How was I supposed
to make it secure?

12:23.780 --> 12:26.614
You were head of security.
Why wouldn't you be allowed

12:26.650 --> 12:29.384
to secure it?
Dunlop Investments, dude.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.986
They handle money from
every dictator and scumbag

12:32.022 --> 12:34.756
in the world.
Dunlop wanted that info

12:34.791 --> 12:36.491
protected even from me.

12:36.526 --> 12:37.759
So you think you got fired

12:37.794 --> 12:39.394
because you were
getting too close?

12:39.429 --> 12:41.796
Yeah.

12:41.831 --> 12:45.233
And... maybe Holt
got killed because...

12:45.268 --> 12:47.368
he got even closer.

12:52.175 --> 12:53.608
This is
very good work

12:53.643 --> 12:55.176
on the thorax.
Goes a lot faster

12:55.211 --> 12:57.178
when there's two of us.
We found kerf marks

12:57.213 --> 12:59.147
on both the scapulas,
and on the inferior margin

12:59.182 --> 13:00.648
of the manubrium.
These

13:00.684 --> 13:02.850
kerf marks are from one
of Pelant's victims.

13:02.886 --> 13:04.319
They appear
to be a match.

13:09.893 --> 13:12.193
Well, you are
correct, Mr. Bray.

13:12.228 --> 13:15.530
The killer used the same type
of bone saw that Pelant did.

13:15.565 --> 13:16.898
This is a perfect
imitation.

13:16.933 --> 13:18.966
Hmm.

13:19.002 --> 13:20.468
What do you see,
Dr. Brennan?

13:20.503 --> 13:23.004
Do you want to be a student
forever, Mr. Bray?

13:23.039 --> 13:25.006
Uh, no, of-of course not.

13:25.041 --> 13:26.941
Then take a look
for yourself.

13:26.976 --> 13:28.976
See what others wouldn't.
I'm not gonna always be here

13:29.012 --> 13:31.879
to bail you out. The same
goes for you, Dr. Edison.

13:31.915 --> 13:33.014
I'm already a doctor.

13:33.049 --> 13:34.582
Then show us why.

13:34.617 --> 13:35.950
There's a subtle

13:35.985 --> 13:37.719
differentiation
between the striae.

13:39.856 --> 13:43.424
Yes. And the ones
on the manubrium...

13:43.460 --> 13:46.461
appear to have a slight
waver to them.

13:46.496 --> 13:48.563
These are hesitation marks.

13:48.598 --> 13:51.265
Pelant never hesitated.
The killer mimicked

13:51.301 --> 13:52.867
Pelant's technique,
but doesn't share

13:52.902 --> 13:54.869
Pelant's enthusiasms.
Precisely. This is

13:54.904 --> 13:56.571
someone who is questioning
their actions.

13:56.606 --> 13:58.206
Which makes him vulnerable.

14:01.077 --> 14:03.144
<i>Ellickson pointed us to,</i>
<i>uh, Dunlop Investments.</i>

14:03.179 --> 14:04.812
<i>I know,</i>

14:04.848 --> 14:08.082
and Dunlop is protected
by about a thousand lawyers.

14:08.118 --> 14:09.784
That's how he can stay so dirty

14:09.819 --> 14:11.285
and not smell.
That's probably where

14:11.321 --> 14:12.787
Hodgins' money wound up,
you know...

14:12.822 --> 14:14.155
the money that Pelant stole.

14:14.190 --> 14:16.624
Are you gonna let Aubrey

14:16.659 --> 14:17.992
question him alone, too?

14:18.027 --> 14:19.267
You know,
Aubrey's a good agent.

14:19.295 --> 14:22.063
He led us to Dunlop.

14:22.098 --> 14:24.098
What's happening,<i> Cher?</i>

14:24.134 --> 14:27.101
No way you take a step back

14:27.137 --> 14:29.337
on a Pelant case for no reason.

14:30.874 --> 14:33.841
I want to see how things go
without me.

14:33.877 --> 14:36.110
Without you?

14:53.630 --> 14:56.130
This is between
you and me, for now,

14:56.166 --> 14:58.866
but, uh...

14:58.902 --> 15:02.170
this is gonna be my last case.

15:03.740 --> 15:05.773
Oh, my Lord.

15:05.809 --> 15:08.509
You can't be serious.

15:09.779 --> 15:11.345
Look, there are still
a few places on me

15:11.381 --> 15:12.947
that haven't been shot
or broken,

15:12.982 --> 15:15.249
and I'd like
to keep it that way

15:15.285 --> 15:17.318
for as long
as I can.

15:18.521 --> 15:21.389
There's a lot
of good agents here.

15:21.424 --> 15:22.824
A lot better than me.

15:22.859 --> 15:24.091
Oh...

15:24.127 --> 15:26.260
You shut up, Seeley Booth.

15:26.296 --> 15:28.396
There is no one better than you.

15:33.169 --> 15:36.270
But I'll act like there is
if you want me to.

15:36.306 --> 15:38.139
This isn't easy for me.

15:38.174 --> 15:40.174
Easier than
it is for me,

15:40.210 --> 15:41.843
because you chose it

15:41.878 --> 15:43.644
and I didn't.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.614
Look, I'm still gonna be here
until we, you know,

15:46.649 --> 15:48.950
catch whoever did this.
Oh, don't tell me that,

15:48.985 --> 15:53.020
or I might make sure
this bastard gets away.

15:57.727 --> 16:00.561
So, what do you need from me?

16:00.597 --> 16:05.132
Ah, a little
Justice Department muscle

16:05.168 --> 16:08.269
when we go talk to Dunlop.

16:11.808 --> 16:14.242
All of his computer equipment
is useless.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.844
The drives are gone,
the memory chips are fried.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.347
Whoever went through
Holt's stuff took everything

16:19.382 --> 16:21.048
and left us
with nothing.

16:21.084 --> 16:23.017
It's hard to believe
a computer hacker that brilliant

16:23.052 --> 16:24.418
would allow his work
to be stolen that easily.

16:24.454 --> 16:25.520
Yeah, and I've been
through everything.

16:25.555 --> 16:26.954
The solid state chips

16:26.990 --> 16:29.156
on his microwave and TV,

16:29.192 --> 16:29.818
the clocks...

16:29.842 --> 16:31.842
Oh, my God.
<i>Strange Brew?</i>

16:31.895 --> 16:33.060
I love this movie.

16:33.096 --> 16:34.228
Daisy. What are
you doing here?

16:34.264 --> 16:36.697
I came to say "Au revoir."

16:36.733 --> 16:38.766
Not good-bye.
Oh, Daisy...

16:38.801 --> 16:41.202
You dear, sweet,
wonderful woman.

16:41.237 --> 16:43.204
It's not that big a deal.
I was, I was close by, so...

16:43.239 --> 16:45.072
You found it.
Well, I'm sure you can get

16:45.108 --> 16:46.841
a copy on eBay.
No, no. The tape.

16:46.876 --> 16:48.809
He must have put the data
on the tape,

16:48.845 --> 16:50.845
because no one would look here.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.247
I think this is it,
I think I got it.

16:53.283 --> 16:54.715
Why are you guys
still working?

16:54.751 --> 16:56.384
I thought you were done.
Yeah.

16:56.419 --> 16:57.652
We, uh, we will be soon,

16:57.687 --> 16:58.886
but this might be Pelant's work.

16:58.922 --> 17:00.922
- Oh.
- Daisy,

17:00.957 --> 17:02.456
if you're not busy, we could use
an extra pair of eyes.

17:02.492 --> 17:04.592
Coming.

17:04.627 --> 17:07.627
<i>Mr. Dunlop,</i>
<i>we suspect your firm</i>

17:07.664 --> 17:10.131
<i>handled Pelant's account,</i>
<i>worth $4.6 billion.</i>

17:10.165 --> 17:12.633
$4.6 billion?

17:12.669 --> 17:14.367
I think I'd know
if I managed an account

17:14.404 --> 17:15.703
- with that amount.
- Right.

17:15.738 --> 17:17.104
Owen Ellickson said
there were servers

17:17.140 --> 17:18.839
he wasn't even
allowed to access,

17:18.875 --> 17:20.840
you know, even though he was
the senior security officer.

17:20.877 --> 17:22.276
Mr. Ellickson
was bitter

17:22.311 --> 17:24.579
after being fired.
You can't trust him.

17:24.614 --> 17:28.883
There is no $4.6
billion account.

17:28.918 --> 17:31.218
- Now, I'm a very busy man, so...
- Nope.

17:31.254 --> 17:33.154
Nope, not yet.
This guy's driving me crazy,

17:33.189 --> 17:35.590
parsing his words
like my father.

17:35.625 --> 17:36.958
If you have daddy
issues, Agent Aubrey,

17:36.993 --> 17:38.192
perhaps a visit
to a shrink

17:38.227 --> 17:39.627
is going to be more advantageous

17:39.662 --> 17:41.395
than talking to me.

17:41.431 --> 17:43.764
My father is Philip Aubrey.
Maybe you've heard of him.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.267
He stole billions
from his clients,

17:46.302 --> 17:48.035
so I know how this works.

17:48.071 --> 17:50.571
So you say that you don't have
an account worth 4.6,

17:50.607 --> 17:52.506
because today the value might be

17:52.542 --> 17:54.108
4.63 or 4.8.

17:54.143 --> 17:56.444
So, in your twisted little mind,
you've told the truth.

17:56.479 --> 17:58.813
And if the account's in the name
of some holding company,

17:58.848 --> 18:00.281
then you can honestly report

18:00.316 --> 18:01.816
that you don't have anything
that belongs

18:01.851 --> 18:04.118
to Christopher Pelant
and Associates.

18:04.153 --> 18:05.519
Now, you should know
that I actually helped

18:05.555 --> 18:07.788
bring down my own father,
Mr. Dunlop.

18:07.824 --> 18:10.825
So bringing you down
will be a piece of cake.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.327
And as my friends here

18:13.363 --> 18:15.029
can attest, I love cake.

18:15.064 --> 18:16.631
This is harassment,
Ms. Julian.

18:16.666 --> 18:19.734
My attorneys will be talking to you.
Oh, no,<i> Cher.</i>

18:19.769 --> 18:21.669
You haven't seen harassment yet.

18:21.704 --> 18:23.504
You see, we have a dead man

18:23.539 --> 18:25.306
and need a suspect.

18:25.341 --> 18:26.607
And all the evidence
points to you.

18:26.643 --> 18:28.209
Circumstantial at best

18:28.244 --> 18:29.644
but enough for us
to get an arrest warrant.

18:29.679 --> 18:31.012
And since you seem
to hide money

18:31.047 --> 18:32.446
for drug lords and dictators,

18:32.482 --> 18:34.081
I can't imagine
what they'd do to you

18:34.117 --> 18:36.350
if we hauled you in
on a murder charge.

18:40.289 --> 18:41.689
It's gone.

18:43.026 --> 18:44.792
Two days ago,
when you found

18:44.827 --> 18:49.063
the body, the account
disappeared. Every penny.

18:49.098 --> 18:51.332
It just vanished.

18:51.367 --> 18:52.733
I swear.

18:52.769 --> 18:54.535
You can look
on the server.

18:56.499 --> 18:58.960
<i>Well, I was right.</i>
<i>The information was encrypted</i>

18:58.961 --> 19:01.328
and stored on <i> Strange Brew,</i>
which is aptly named.

19:01.364 --> 19:04.798
Will you be able to decrypt it
before you leave?

19:04.834 --> 19:06.467
Well, the whole tape
would take months,

19:06.502 --> 19:09.503
but I've set up an algorithm
that sifts for anyone

19:09.538 --> 19:10.804
Booth suspects.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.706
I'm just trying
to get enough info on it

19:12.742 --> 19:15.042
so we can solve this
before we leave.

19:16.178 --> 19:17.811
Me, too.

19:17.847 --> 19:20.014
What do you mean?

19:20.049 --> 19:24.218
This will be our last case,
too, Angela.

19:24.253 --> 19:26.320
Booth and mine.

19:26.355 --> 19:29.656
It's fitting
that it's related to Pelant.

19:30.793 --> 19:31.959
Whoa, whoa.

19:31.994 --> 19:33.694
Wait a minute.
You're quitting?

19:33.729 --> 19:38.098
Well, I'll always be
a forensic anthropologist,

19:38.134 --> 19:40.267
but Booth and I...

19:40.302 --> 19:42.770
after all that
we've been through lately,

19:42.805 --> 19:44.204
and with the baby coming,

19:44.240 --> 19:47.241
we, like you, need a change.

19:47.276 --> 19:49.043
Seriously?

19:49.979 --> 19:52.746
You want to leave, too?

19:52.782 --> 19:55.916
I prefer to describe it

19:55.951 --> 19:57.951
as entering
a phase of discovery,

19:57.987 --> 20:00.087
of embracing
the unknown.

20:00.122 --> 20:01.321
Which, as you know,

20:01.357 --> 20:04.658
is where all the greatest

20:04.693 --> 20:06.960
scientific advancements
come from.

20:06.996 --> 20:10.030
Which will not be
taking place here,

20:10.066 --> 20:11.832
which is "leaving."

20:13.536 --> 20:15.102
Right.

20:15.137 --> 20:16.370
Yes.

20:18.207 --> 20:19.440
Oh...

20:19.475 --> 20:22.342
Okay... Wow.

20:22.378 --> 20:23.710
So there were e-mails

20:23.746 --> 20:26.413
between Franklin Holt
and Owen Ellickson.

20:26.449 --> 20:28.048
They were working together.

20:28.084 --> 20:29.817
I'll let Booth know.

20:29.852 --> 20:31.118
Dr. Brennan,

20:31.153 --> 20:34.221
when were you planning
on telling me?

20:34.256 --> 20:38.358
I... wasn't sure.

20:38.394 --> 20:41.295
Because...

20:41.330 --> 20:44.264
you're not merely my superior,

20:44.300 --> 20:46.567
but you are also my friend.

20:46.602 --> 20:49.636
The thought of hurting you...

20:55.177 --> 20:58.946
Clearly this is not
my area of expertise,

20:58.981 --> 21:01.682
and for that I apologize

21:01.717 --> 21:04.952
and hope that
you can forgive me.

21:06.055 --> 21:08.655
Of course.
I just...

21:10.993 --> 21:14.962
You should probably tell Booth
about Ellickson.

21:20.202 --> 21:22.503
What is happening?

21:22.538 --> 21:25.372
Based on the blood spatter
at the crime scene,

21:25.407 --> 21:27.407
- Cam thinks Holt was shot.
- But there's no evidence

21:27.443 --> 21:29.376
of trauma from a projectile
anywhere on the body.

21:29.411 --> 21:30.811
Which means it's likely
that the bullet

21:30.846 --> 21:32.412
was lodged in an area
of the body

21:32.448 --> 21:34.114
cut away to accommodate
the obelisk.

21:34.150 --> 21:35.682
No better way
to obscure a bullet wound

21:35.718 --> 21:37.084
than to cut out
everything around it.

21:37.119 --> 21:38.619
No, not everything.

21:38.654 --> 21:40.020
There are radiating fractures

21:40.055 --> 21:41.788
on the left scapula.

21:41.824 --> 21:43.757
Look at the medial portion
of the fractures.

21:43.792 --> 21:45.058
Hemorrhagic
staining

21:45.094 --> 21:47.194
indicates the damage
was perimortem,

21:47.229 --> 21:48.762
mostly likely caused
by hydrostatic shock

21:48.797 --> 21:49.963
from the bullet.

21:49.999 --> 21:51.465
He was
definitely shot.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.134
Yes, but what we still
can't explain is this:

21:54.170 --> 21:56.837
when the remains were cut
to obscure the gunshot,

21:56.872 --> 21:58.071
the killer didn't follow

21:58.107 --> 21:59.940
the natural curve of the bones.

21:59.975 --> 22:01.441
He could've adjusted
his instrument

22:01.477 --> 22:02.976
just a few millimeters

22:03.012 --> 22:04.711
and then cut through tendons
to the bone.

22:04.747 --> 22:06.980
Which would've been faster
and easier.

22:07.016 --> 22:09.256
Dr. Brennan's gonna expect us
to know what happened here.

22:09.285 --> 22:11.051
If there was so much expertise
required

22:11.086 --> 22:12.819
to remove
the victim's midsection,

22:12.855 --> 22:16.056
why was it done
in the worst possible way?

22:21.130 --> 22:24.665
This pizza is covered
with <i> Cladosporium.</i>

22:24.700 --> 22:26.266
Ooh, one of my
least favorite molds.

22:26.302 --> 22:28.302
Well, give me a second,
and you are gonna love it.

22:28.337 --> 22:32.005
So,<i> Cladosporium</i> produces
filaments, which if you're cool,

22:32.041 --> 22:35.008
you call hyphae,
at a constant rate.

22:35.044 --> 22:38.545
Now, based on the amount of
hyphae growth on this pizza,

22:38.581 --> 22:42.629
tells me that it was delivered
to the victim the night he was killed.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.551
So he was murdered sometime
after it was delivered.

22:44.587 --> 22:46.787
Well, based on the
length of these fellas,

22:46.822 --> 22:49.556
I would say it was sometime
between 8:00 and 10:00 p.m.

22:49.592 --> 22:52.359
Impressive as always, Dr. Hodgins.

22:52.394 --> 22:57.464
And now, if you are done,
you can continue to pack.

22:57.499 --> 22:59.266
You anxious to get rid of me?

22:59.301 --> 23:01.668
If it were up to me,
I'd never let you go.

23:01.704 --> 23:04.004
Oh, man. That
sounds good.

23:04.039 --> 23:06.006
But Angie...

23:06.041 --> 23:08.775
I would do anything for her.

23:08.811 --> 23:10.377
Well, you're a good man.

23:10.794 --> 23:13.428
And change is good, right?
Right.

23:13.464 --> 23:17.199
I mean... with you two
and Dr. Brennan leaving,

23:17.234 --> 23:19.868
I have to convince myself.
"Dr. Brennan leaving"?

23:19.903 --> 23:22.070
Oh, you didn't know?

23:22.106 --> 23:25.107
Sorry. I... thought...
I just found out.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.676
No, that-that's impossible, Cam.

23:27.711 --> 23:29.511
No matter what she said,
she's not gonna leave.

23:29.546 --> 23:31.046
This lab is her life.

23:31.081 --> 23:32.614
From your lips.

23:32.650 --> 23:35.117
Anyway, I'll find someone
to help finish up.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.485
No, I can do it.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.420
I still have to compile
the particulates

23:38.455 --> 23:40.555
from the obelisk, so...

23:40.591 --> 23:43.759
Take your time.

23:49.333 --> 23:52.000
<i>What was it, Ellickson, huh?</i>
<i>You killed Holt</i>

23:52.035 --> 23:54.035
so all the other hackers
wouldn't

23:54.071 --> 23:56.738
tap into Pelant's money?
I didn't kill him.

23:56.773 --> 23:59.007
So, what about the e-mails
between the two of you?

23:59.042 --> 24:00.508
Who wrote those?

24:00.544 --> 24:03.778
You can't just go
into my accounts

24:03.814 --> 24:05.347
without a warrant or a subpoena.

24:05.382 --> 24:07.349
I know my rights.
Look, you don't need a warrant

24:07.384 --> 24:09.317
to go through
a murder victim's computer.

24:09.353 --> 24:11.186
Now we're decrypting
some wire transfers.

24:11.221 --> 24:13.255
Holt was paying you.

24:14.224 --> 24:17.659
O-Okay. Okay. Look,

24:17.694 --> 24:19.975
he paid me for some of the
passwords for Dunlop's servers.

24:19.997 --> 24:22.130
He was going after
the money, and...

24:22.165 --> 24:24.019
he was gonna give me a taste
when he got it.

24:24.043 --> 24:24.834
So you wanted

24:24.835 --> 24:27.535
more than a taste.
That's why you killed him.

24:27.571 --> 24:29.738
No.
Then who was it, huh?

24:29.773 --> 24:32.974
Was Dunlop working with you? Money
vanishes so Dunlop looks like the victim

24:33.010 --> 24:35.844
and you two split it all.
Not Dunlop. I'm dirt

24:35.879 --> 24:37.746
to him. This was all Holt.

24:37.781 --> 24:39.347
He was the only guy
who could pull it off.

24:39.383 --> 24:41.549
And he never showed you
what he was doing.

24:41.585 --> 24:44.986
He said he'd kill me if I
even tried to look for the data.

24:45.022 --> 24:47.689
Look, I was just trying to
make a little extra cash.

24:47.724 --> 24:50.392
That's all.

24:50.427 --> 24:52.560
Pelant's money was dirty anyway.

24:52.596 --> 24:54.362
Who was I hurting?

24:54.398 --> 24:57.966
Oh, the judge will explain
all that when you're sentenced.

25:03.298 --> 25:05.218
Dr. Brennan is really leaving
the Jeffersonian?

25:06.245 --> 25:08.446
That's what I heard.
I can't believe it.

25:08.481 --> 25:10.815
It won't be the Jeffersonian
without Dr. Brennan here.

25:10.850 --> 25:12.917
Of course it will, Ms. Wick.

25:12.952 --> 25:14.685
The name of this institution
has nothing to do

25:14.720 --> 25:17.288
with my employment agreement.
And as for this department,

25:17.323 --> 25:20.825
it has always been my wish to
leave it in the hands of a new,

25:20.860 --> 25:24.395
well-trained, brilliant team
of forensic anthropologists.

25:24.430 --> 25:26.464
Aw.
Now let's see

25:26.499 --> 25:28.165
if I made a mistake endowing you
with those qualities.

25:28.201 --> 25:29.767
What have you found?
We've been assuming

25:29.802 --> 25:31.202
that the cuts on the bones
were either mistakes

25:31.237 --> 25:32.870
or hesitations.
But looking again,

25:32.905 --> 25:34.572
we believe the killer had
a limited range of motion.

25:34.607 --> 25:36.240
He can only make incisions
as long

25:36.275 --> 25:37.842
as they are straight
and on a vertical axis.

25:37.877 --> 25:39.477
He's unable
to rotate his wrists

25:39.512 --> 25:41.212
as he cuts. It's the only thing
that makes sense.

25:41.247 --> 25:43.781
He has radioulnar synostosis?

25:43.816 --> 25:45.116
Yes. A very
rare condition

25:45.151 --> 25:47.351
that can ID our killer.

25:47.386 --> 25:49.787
Well, I believe I used the word
"brilliant" to describe you,

25:49.822 --> 25:50.988
and, as usual,

25:51.023 --> 25:52.690
I was correct.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.125
I'll tell Booth to subpoena

25:54.160 --> 25:56.694
the suspect's medical records.

26:02.336 --> 26:05.232
<i> Dr. Hodgins,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

26:05.233 --> 26:07.405
Hey. I borrowed this puppy

26:07.440 --> 26:09.540
from the Manhattan Project
exhibit.

26:09.575 --> 26:12.643
Uh, Hodgins, please tell me
you're not building a bomb.

26:12.678 --> 26:15.880
Fear not, Angie,
this is the original

26:15.915 --> 26:18.149
calutron,
handmade

26:18.184 --> 26:20.584
by Ernest Lawrence himself.
I mean, come on.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.987
You can just feel the genius
that went into this.

26:23.022 --> 26:24.822
Huh?
Isn't a calutron just an early

26:24.857 --> 26:27.691
mass spectrometer?
We already have the most cutting-edge

26:27.727 --> 26:29.693
mass specs right here
in the lab.

26:29.729 --> 26:33.664
Okay, look, I could spin you
a tale about how this separates

26:33.699 --> 26:35.699
elemental electrons and whatnot,
but the truth is,

26:35.735 --> 26:37.835
I just... I've been wanting

26:37.870 --> 26:39.937
to get my hands on it for years,
and this is

26:39.972 --> 26:42.439
my last chance.
Well, I hope this helps because

26:42.475 --> 26:45.276
there is no mention
of radioulnar synostosis

26:45.311 --> 26:48.695
in either Ellickson's
or Dunlop's medical records.

26:48.696 --> 26:50.849
Well, the records
could've been altered.

26:50.883 --> 26:52.850
Good. Then I'll proceed.

26:52.885 --> 26:56.253
Now, we know
that Holt ordered pizza delivery

26:56.289 --> 26:58.022
from the same
place, right?

26:58.057 --> 27:01.525
Right. He was a shut-in, so
he was probably a bit paranoid.

27:01.561 --> 27:03.360
Yes. But he must-- excuse me--

27:03.396 --> 27:07.131
have had trust for the pizza
delivery person, right?

27:07.166 --> 27:09.867
And what does that have to do
with an irreplaceable piece

27:09.902 --> 27:12.336
of American history?
This...

27:12.371 --> 27:16.707
is the last pizza box delivered
to Holt prior to his death.

27:16.742 --> 27:19.710
Put that in there.

27:19.745 --> 27:22.279
Okay. Excuse me.

27:34.026 --> 27:35.226
Oh.

27:35.261 --> 27:38.229
Look.
It's beautiful.

27:38.264 --> 27:40.064
Yeah.

27:40.099 --> 27:41.765
Yeah.
So, the...

27:41.801 --> 27:44.335
the heavier isotopes,
they-they fall further

27:44.370 --> 27:47.004
- than the lighter ones.
- I see. So the box

27:47.039 --> 27:51.208
is made of cellulose,
which is a chain

27:51.244 --> 27:55.579
of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms.
That's right.

27:55.615 --> 27:57.481
That's right. And down here
we've got barium,

27:57.516 --> 28:00.117
- antimony, and lead.
- Gunshot residue.

28:00.152 --> 28:03.120
That's why he didn't eat
the pizza-- because he was dead.

28:03.155 --> 28:06.156
So he was shot
by the pizza delivery guy?

28:06.192 --> 28:09.293
That's my bet.

28:10.162 --> 28:11.862
Thanks, old friend.

28:11.897 --> 28:13.397
I'll miss you.

28:18.104 --> 28:21.038
Uh, yeah, I know Holt.
Uh, the name, anyway.

28:21.073 --> 28:23.140
Let's see,
every night, same thing--

28:23.175 --> 28:26.043
extra garlic, onions, mushrooms,

28:26.078 --> 28:28.612
uh, pepperoni on half.
Toppings are not important.

28:28.648 --> 28:30.114
They do look good, though.

28:30.149 --> 28:31.682
Hey, is Holt
okay, though?

28:31.717 --> 28:33.417
Because we haven't sent out
a pie in days.

28:33.452 --> 28:35.252
That's because he's dead.

28:35.288 --> 28:36.854
Last time he ordered
was, uh, Tuesday,

28:36.889 --> 28:38.822
okay? So who made the delivery?

28:38.858 --> 28:42.126
Uh, nobody.
No, the delivery was canceled.

28:42.161 --> 28:44.094
Somebody called and said they'd pick it up.
Who was it?

28:44.130 --> 28:47.197
What did he look like?
Don't know. Tuesday was crazy.

28:47.233 --> 28:48.527
Not time to socialize,
you know what I'm saying?

28:48.550 --> 28:50.364
Booth, look,
the killer could've bought

28:50.365 --> 28:52.904
a T-shirt and a hat, posed
as the delivery guy.

28:52.938 --> 28:55.239
All right. Look, the security
cameras you have here,

28:55.274 --> 28:58.108
I'm gonna need all that footage
from Tuesday night.

28:58.144 --> 28:59.743
Uh, well,
it's not the best system.

28:59.779 --> 29:02.379
I mean, I told the owner
we need to upgrade, but he...

29:02.415 --> 29:03.180
Go.

29:03.215 --> 29:05.616
Yes, sir.

29:05.651 --> 29:07.618
Okay, so here comes the
guy to pick up the pizza.

29:07.653 --> 29:09.486
Is there no other angle?

29:09.522 --> 29:11.155
We'll never see his face.

29:11.190 --> 29:12.423
Well, the other
camera was broken.

29:12.458 --> 29:13.624
We don't need a face.

29:13.659 --> 29:15.192
He has radioulnar synostosis.

29:16.495 --> 29:18.462
Okay, so there's the pie,

29:18.497 --> 29:20.464
which is Holt's
usual order.

29:22.702 --> 29:23.967
That's him.

29:24.003 --> 29:25.803
Yeah, he can't
turn his wrists.

29:25.838 --> 29:27.738
But he's too short
to be Owen Ellickson.

29:27.773 --> 29:29.173
Or Dunlop.

29:29.208 --> 29:30.741
Oh, my God.

29:30.776 --> 29:32.209
What? What
do you see?

29:32.244 --> 29:34.144
Well, don't ask me, ask them.

29:34.180 --> 29:36.347
Y-You see it,
don't you?

29:36.382 --> 29:38.015
What is it?

29:38.050 --> 29:39.783
We're looking, Dr. Brennan.

29:39.819 --> 29:42.252
No preconceptions,
just observe.

29:42.288 --> 29:43.620
What am I missing?

29:43.656 --> 29:45.089
Ugh, am I that
bad of a teacher?

29:45.124 --> 29:48.125
Have I wasted all of
these years on you people?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.827
Brennan, let them
concentrate.

29:49.862 --> 29:51.362
Well, now I can never leave

29:51.397 --> 29:53.430
because no one is competent
enough to replace me.

29:56.502 --> 29:57.935
It's not a guy,
it's a woman.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.670
Yeah, small steps.

29:59.705 --> 30:01.739
Notice the valgus
angulation of her knees.

30:01.774 --> 30:03.540
So the way she's
carrying herself...

30:03.576 --> 30:04.908
The killer is a woman.

30:04.944 --> 30:07.277
I am an excellent teacher.

30:07.313 --> 30:10.347
I believe this is Franklin
Holt's girlfriend, Leelah.

30:10.383 --> 30:11.882
Wait, girlfriend?

30:11.917 --> 30:13.650
I've been through
all of his e-mails,

30:13.686 --> 30:15.419
his social media
platforms,

30:15.454 --> 30:17.454
and he's never once
mentioned a girlfriend.

30:17.490 --> 30:20.190
So she wasn't at his place
looking for him.

30:20.226 --> 30:22.960
Well, she must have
taken his hard drives

30:22.995 --> 30:26.196
and never got the data she was
looking for to get the money.

30:33.825 --> 30:35.725
She's gone.

30:37.128 --> 30:40.864
Angela said that Leelah was
a hacker known as Mainframe.

30:40.899 --> 30:43.366
Accounts for all the
cables and wiring.

30:43.401 --> 30:44.701
She must have thought, uh,

30:44.736 --> 30:46.636
she was gonna be
a suspect eventually.

30:46.671 --> 30:48.438
So she got rid of her computers

30:48.473 --> 30:50.006
and then
she took off.

30:51.476 --> 30:52.876
Oh.

30:52.911 --> 30:54.477
This.

30:55.380 --> 30:56.946
Pelant.

30:57.983 --> 30:59.749
Yeah, hey, Angela.

30:59.784 --> 31:01.718
She's gone,
even her computers.

31:01.753 --> 31:02.785
Okay.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.087
That's what we figured,

31:04.122 --> 31:06.189
but Holt did have Leelah
in his files,

31:06.224 --> 31:08.191
just not as his girlfriend.

31:08.226 --> 31:10.493
He tracked all of her activity,

31:10.529 --> 31:11.995
so he was clearly
suspicious of her.

31:12.030 --> 31:14.230
Okay, look, please tell me
you can find her.

31:14.266 --> 31:15.632
So Holt used a digital trap

31:15.667 --> 31:17.467
to track anyone
that tried to steal from him.

31:17.502 --> 31:19.702
An hour ago, Leelah used

31:19.738 --> 31:22.171
one of her anonymous
IP addresses to rent a car.

31:22.207 --> 31:23.940
So she could be
anywhere.

31:23.975 --> 31:26.943
Well, she used a debit card
at a gas station in Ashburn.

31:26.978 --> 31:29.012
Now, I picked her up
on a traffic cam,

31:29.047 --> 31:32.081
exiting Route 70,
three miles north of Hagerstown.

31:32.117 --> 31:33.683
Okay, there's a major
rail yard there.

31:33.718 --> 31:35.652
If she gets on a train,

31:35.687 --> 31:38.388
I can't track her.
Thanks. Let's go, come on.

31:38.423 --> 31:40.490
<i>Look, Leelah must have thought,</i>
<i>with Holt dead,</i>

31:40.525 --> 31:41.958
she could take his files
and get the money.

31:41.993 --> 31:43.092
Yeah, but Holt
covered his tracks.

31:43.128 --> 31:44.861
So you think
she got to the money?

31:44.896 --> 31:46.129
Angela doesn't
think so, okay?

31:46.164 --> 31:47.864
The key to all of
this is on the tape,

31:47.899 --> 31:49.999
but, you know, it could
take her months to find it.

31:50.035 --> 31:51.935
You'll be long gone
by then, right?

31:51.970 --> 31:55.972
All right, let's just bring in
Leelah Strawn for now, okay?

32:07.752 --> 32:09.252
This yard
goes on forever.

32:09.287 --> 32:10.887
<i>Talk about a needle</i>
<i>in a haystack.</i>

32:10.922 --> 32:12.822
<i> She'll be looking</i>
<i>for an outbound train.</i>

32:18.430 --> 32:20.697
Hey.
Hey.

32:34.079 --> 32:36.079
That's got to be her car.

32:36.114 --> 32:38.147
And these tracks have
the only three trains

32:38.183 --> 32:39.282
scheduled to leave.

32:44.089 --> 32:46.255
Car's clear.

32:48.093 --> 32:50.226
She can't have
gone far.

33:06.177 --> 33:10.013
Anything?

33:10.048 --> 33:11.547
I didn't see her.

33:11.583 --> 33:13.950
Yeah, well, she's got to
be around here somewhere.

33:13.985 --> 33:16.552
Whoa, whoa, wait.

33:16.588 --> 33:18.621
Right there. That's her.

33:43.381 --> 33:45.748
Aubrey, next track.

33:58.763 --> 34:01.297
Sorry I'm late.

34:15.013 --> 34:16.411
This is the last car.

34:16.447 --> 34:17.780
She's trapped.

34:38.469 --> 34:40.737
All right, let's not
be foolish, okay?

35:16.508 --> 35:18.241
You all right?
Yeah.

35:18.276 --> 35:20.743
Nice shot.

35:20.779 --> 35:23.179
Told me to take the collar.

35:23.214 --> 35:24.781
I took the collar.

35:24.816 --> 35:26.249
All right, let's go.

35:26.284 --> 35:28.317
Let's go, come on.

35:36.494 --> 35:39.295
Hey. What's up, Angie?

35:40.265 --> 35:42.198
The money.

35:42.233 --> 35:45.802
The-the drives that
Leelah took from Holt helped me

35:45.837 --> 35:47.436
to decrypt more of the tape.

35:47.472 --> 35:51.040
I found your money.

35:51.075 --> 35:53.309
I found all of it.

35:54.445 --> 35:56.412
Oh.

35:56.447 --> 35:58.981
Wow.

36:00.919 --> 36:02.785
Does anybody know
about this yet?

36:02.821 --> 36:04.887
I Th-- I thought
you should be the first.

36:04.923 --> 36:07.957
You're brilliant, Angie.

36:10.094 --> 36:12.261
Now get rid of it.

36:12.297 --> 36:15.398
You can do that, right, so
that nobody ever finds it?

36:15.433 --> 36:17.934
Uh, yeah,

36:17.969 --> 36:20.770
but...
Do it.

36:20.805 --> 36:22.705
It's not my
money anymore,

36:22.740 --> 36:24.407
Angie, and there's
so much blood on it,

36:24.442 --> 36:26.142
and as long as it's
still out there,

36:26.177 --> 36:27.677
every crazy
hacker's gonna try...

36:27.712 --> 36:29.245
It's $4 billion.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.913
We don't need it.

36:30.949 --> 36:33.883
We have enough, Angie.

36:33.918 --> 36:37.987
Make it go to a
hundred charities, okay?

36:38.022 --> 36:40.289
Yeah, let them...

36:40.325 --> 36:44.293
Let 'em find a cure for the
cancer that Wendell has.

36:44.329 --> 36:47.330
Please, Angie.

36:49.434 --> 36:51.801
One condition.

36:51.836 --> 36:54.537
Okay.

36:54.572 --> 36:57.840
We don't leave the Jeffersonian.

36:57.876 --> 37:00.977
You keep doing

37:01.012 --> 37:03.045
what you do.

37:03.081 --> 37:04.747
But... Paris. We agreed.

37:04.782 --> 37:10.219
No,<i> you</i> agreed,
because you're wonderful.

37:10.255 --> 37:14.457
But I-I saw you
with that-that crazy machine,

37:14.492 --> 37:18.294
and... your-your life is here.

37:18.329 --> 37:21.030
For now.

37:21.065 --> 37:23.399
And-and I'm okay with it.

37:23.434 --> 37:26.802
As long as I'm with you.

37:26.838 --> 37:29.572
Are you serious?

37:29.607 --> 37:32.608
Yeah. I mean, I have
to decrypt the rest

37:32.644 --> 37:35.344
of that... that <i> Strange Brew</i>
tape anyway,

37:35.380 --> 37:37.847
so it's gonna take me months.

37:37.882 --> 37:40.516
After that, we can go
to Paris for a vacation.

37:58.937 --> 38:01.771
Is it true?

38:01.806 --> 38:05.508
Hodgins and Angela
have reconsidered, but...

38:05.543 --> 38:09.312
Dr. Brennan, Booth.

38:09.347 --> 38:11.681
She's about to
have a baby, Cam.

38:11.716 --> 38:13.883
And Booth...
Yeah, I know.

38:13.918 --> 38:15.918
I feel foolish. I mean, I...

38:17.355 --> 38:19.655
I know life changes.

38:19.691 --> 38:21.457
And I should be bigger
than this.

38:21.492 --> 38:23.793
I don't... I don't know
why I'm crying.

38:24.929 --> 38:27.697
'Cause you love them.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.367
I do.

38:37.909 --> 38:40.276
Hey, I'm gonna miss you.

38:40.311 --> 38:43.546
Miss you, too.

38:43.581 --> 38:44.947
Always suspected.

38:44.983 --> 38:46.515
Don't worry.

38:46.551 --> 38:48.851
Not a word of this to Dr. B.
You know what?

38:48.886 --> 38:51.253
You're making this a lot
easier to leave, Aubrey.

38:51.289 --> 38:53.931
Always been my dream--
push you out, steal your job.

38:53.955 --> 38:54.925
That's funny.

38:54.926 --> 38:57.360
I'll tell you what. If
you never need any advice

38:57.395 --> 38:59.729
navigating these hallways,
just give me a call.

38:59.764 --> 39:02.698
I don't want you
to look foolish.

39:03.801 --> 39:06.168
I'm gonna miss you, Booth.

39:08.272 --> 39:10.606
Me, too.

39:13.277 --> 39:15.311
Oh.

39:15.346 --> 39:17.413
God.

39:30.995 --> 39:32.728
Hey, sweetie.

39:32.764 --> 39:35.331
Hi.
Listen.

39:35.366 --> 39:39.001
There's something I...
I thought that you should see.

39:45.843 --> 39:47.977
This was on the tape.

39:50.782 --> 39:53.149
If you're watching this,
I'm dead,

39:53.184 --> 39:55.017
but not gone.

39:55.053 --> 39:56.619
There is an afterlife.

39:56.654 --> 39:59.655
A digital afterlife that
will keep me alive forever.

39:59.690 --> 40:02.758
If you thought something as
simple as death would stop me,

40:02.794 --> 40:05.261
you've underestimated
my abilities.

40:05.296 --> 40:08.197
Freed from the limitation...

40:08.232 --> 40:10.566
Hey, what are you,
what are you doing?

40:10.601 --> 40:11.667
Y-You don't
want to...

40:11.702 --> 40:13.235
No.

40:13.271 --> 40:15.304
You really
want to leave

40:15.339 --> 40:16.872
with this just hanging
over your head?

40:16.908 --> 40:21.210
Yes, Angela, in our culture,
we all search for closure,

40:21.245 --> 40:25.648
but closure is
an illusion.

40:25.683 --> 40:29.251
Science shows us
that the universe is

40:29.287 --> 40:31.387
constantly in flux.

40:33.825 --> 40:37.193
It's what allows
our friendships and our love

40:37.228 --> 40:40.529
to constantly
surprise us.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.368
Pelant is in the past.

40:46.404 --> 40:48.771
I-I won't have him steal
the new life

40:48.806 --> 40:50.940
Booth and I are
going to live.

40:53.911 --> 40:56.078
I'm gonna miss you
so much, Brennan.

40:59.317 --> 41:01.016
Hey, listen,
I thought I'd come by

41:01.052 --> 41:03.119
and help you pack up
all this stuff you got.

41:03.154 --> 41:05.254
Oh, um, I'm done.

41:05.289 --> 41:06.489
You're done.

41:06.524 --> 41:08.057
One-one box, you have one box.

41:08.092 --> 41:10.059
After all these years,
you have one box of stuff.

41:10.094 --> 41:12.061
Very true.

41:12.096 --> 41:15.364
And I'm happy to donate all
of my work to the Jeffersonian.

41:15.399 --> 41:17.466
Okay, that's it then.
