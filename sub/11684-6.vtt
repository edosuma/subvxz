WEBVTT

00:00.370 --> 00:01.787
My name
is Michael Westen.

00:01.838 --> 00:03.922
I used to be
a spy until...

00:03.989 --> 00:05.540
[Phone rings]
We got a burn notice on you.

00:05.624 --> 00:07.458
You're blacklisted.
[Whistles]

00:07.510 --> 00:09.844
When you're burned,
you've got nothing.

00:09.929 --> 00:12.130
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.181 --> 00:14.465
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.517 --> 00:16.834
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.886 --> 00:19.170
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.221 --> 00:21.339
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you...

00:21.390 --> 00:22.807
[Laughs]

00:22.858 --> 00:23.808
A trigger-happy girlfriend...

00:23.859 --> 00:25.226
Should we shoot them?

00:25.311 --> 00:27.228
An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:27.313 --> 00:29.864
You know spies--
bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.949 --> 00:31.232
Family too...

00:31.317 --> 00:32.150
[Phone rings]
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:32.201 --> 00:33.618
If you're desperate.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.203
Someone needs your help,
Michael.

00:35.287 --> 00:37.405
And a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.

00:37.489 --> 00:38.990
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.041 --> 00:41.709
Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,

00:41.794 --> 00:43.661
you're not going anywhere.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.130
She is all that matters.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.132
It's been an honor, Mike.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.969
[Explosion]

00:53.053 --> 00:55.755
[Gunfire]

00:55.806 --> 00:57.506
[Tires screech]

00:57.591 --> 00:59.458
There was a rumor
about a deep-cover Russian mole

00:59.509 --> 01:00.593
working around Arlington.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.428
She turned the N.S.A.
inside out.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.679
Yeah, and the information
she sent home

01:03.764 --> 01:05.397
got a lot of good agents killed.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.298
Now, if Sonya
is that operative,

01:06.350 --> 01:07.266
it's only a matter of time

01:07.317 --> 01:08.317
before she stabs us in the back.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.352
I just found out

01:09.436 --> 01:10.436
who exposed my identity.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.938
- Who?
- Hacker syndicate.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.641
Based in Miami.
Somehow they found out who I was

01:15.692 --> 01:17.013
and sold me
to the highest bidder.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.194
What now?

01:18.278 --> 01:20.863
We destroy them,
of course.

01:24.984 --> 01:26.836
For a spy,
running is more

01:26.920 --> 01:31.323
than just a way
to stay in shape.

01:31.375 --> 01:35.895
It keeps your mind focused
and reduces stress,

01:35.962 --> 01:39.465
which are essential
when you're working deep cover.

01:39.516 --> 01:43.386
It also gives you a good excuse
to be in secluded areas,

01:43.470 --> 01:45.271
which makes arranging
covert meetings a lot easier,

01:45.338 --> 01:51.009
if you don't mind
being a little sweaty.

01:51.061 --> 01:53.062
If that's the price
of a flat stomach after 40,

01:53.146 --> 01:55.898
count me out.
Thanks.

01:55.982 --> 01:57.867
They were popping
champagne corks in Langley

01:57.951 --> 01:59.702
when they read
your latest debrief.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.072
Pulling Sonya Lebedenko
out of Cuba

02:03.156 --> 02:05.190
puts our operation
on a whole new level.

02:05.242 --> 02:06.709
Glad to hear it.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.794
So tell me about this job
she wants you to do.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.465
The target is a hacker group
out of Coral Gables.

02:12.532 --> 02:14.652
They find hidden offshore
bank accounts and raid them.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.703
They found Sonya's operational
funds and exposed her.

02:17.754 --> 02:20.038
- So this is about revenge?
- No, it's more than that.

02:20.090 --> 02:21.474
These people don't leave
anything to chance.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.509
She wants everything the hackers
know about them,

02:23.560 --> 02:25.344
and then she wants them
destroyed.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.063
So how does Sonya
plan to do this?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.815
I don't know, we're meeting
at a downtown restaurant.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.150
She'll give me
the details then.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.051
Good.
Okay, just one other thing.

02:33.103 --> 02:35.404
I made arrangements
with Fiona Glenanne

02:35.489 --> 02:38.107
to support you on this,
so tell Sonya--

02:38.191 --> 02:40.192
- No. Strong, no. No.
- You were the one who roped her

02:40.243 --> 02:42.578
into dealing
with the Russian bureaucrat

02:42.662 --> 02:45.581
to help free Sonya,
and she crushed it, by the way.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.451
I would be an idiot
to leave that kind of talent--

02:48.535 --> 02:50.286
I promised Fiona that she
wouldn't be involved in this.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.671
Well, that wasn't your call
to make, was it?

02:52.739 --> 02:54.457
Look, Michael,
we are this close

02:54.541 --> 02:55.591
to the top of the pyramid.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.076
Sonya is our only way in.

02:58.128 --> 03:01.097
I need this to go off
without a hitch.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.183
Now run along.

03:04.250 --> 03:07.636
You're gonna want to shower
before you go to that lunch.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:26.790 --> 03:30.442
You clean up nice.

03:30.494 --> 03:33.295
Not so bad yourself.
Nice place.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.914
A bit fancy
for a planning meeting.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.282
Who said we were planning?

03:37.334 --> 03:39.835
This is step one
of the operation.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.507
One of our fellow restaurant
patrons is a software developer

03:44.591 --> 03:47.393
who happens to be carrying
a nasty computer virus

03:47.460 --> 03:49.929
he developed for the D.O.D.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.096
We're going to be stealing it.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.598
Where is he?

03:52.649 --> 03:55.017
I don't know.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.469
My instructions were to be here
at 1:00 and be ready.

03:57.521 --> 04:01.157
How can we be ready if we
don't know who the target is?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.826
There will be
a medical emergency

04:03.910 --> 04:05.143
in the next few minutes.

04:05.195 --> 04:06.862
He or she
will be our target.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.664
You're a doctor who happens
to be dining here,

04:08.748 --> 04:13.035
and I am your wife.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.703
In the bag
there is a syringe.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.623
Give it to him
after I find the drive.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.091
What kind of medical emergency
are we talking about?

04:20.159 --> 04:24.046
Someone else
is taking care of that.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.465
- Someone?
- Mm-hmm.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.883
When do I get to meet
that someone?

04:27.968 --> 04:29.468
Never.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.136
We like to keep things
compartmentalized.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.471
It's cleaner that way.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.339
Maybe, but it means
walking into an Op

04:34.391 --> 04:37.026
completely in the dark.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.562
There is a difference
between being in the dark

04:39.646 --> 04:41.530
and acting on faith.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.032
[Clatter]

04:43.116 --> 04:44.683
Ron, are you okay?

04:44.734 --> 04:45.985
- [Gasps]
- Hey, man, you all right?

04:46.036 --> 04:48.070
Ron.
Oh, my God!

04:48.154 --> 04:49.855
- Call an ambulance!
- You see?

04:49.906 --> 04:51.690
Faith is rewarded.

04:51.741 --> 04:53.209
Oh, my God.
He can't breathe!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.577
Somebody call a doctor.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.194
I'm a doctor.
What's happened here?

04:56.246 --> 04:58.797
He was eating,
and he just fell.

04:58.865 --> 04:59.986
This man
is having a seizure.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.273
I need you
to step back, please.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.501
Honey, I need you
to help me.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.803
Loosen his tie and his belt.
Is he-

05:04.871 --> 05:05.871
Just--I need you
to get back, please.

05:05.922 --> 05:07.389
Just get back.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.540
Let's roll him
on his side

05:08.592 --> 05:09.642
in case he vomits.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.261
- Okay.
- Ron.

05:12.345 --> 05:15.848
Wake up.
Ron?

05:15.899 --> 05:17.382
I'm giving your friend
an injection

05:17.434 --> 05:18.934
that will stop the seizure.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.553
Come on, man.
Breathe.

05:21.605 --> 05:23.105
All right,
wake up.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.858
Come on. Come on.
Come back.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.159
Okay, you're gonna
be all right.

05:27.226 --> 05:28.360
All right, your friend's
gonna be okay,

05:28.411 --> 05:29.745
but you need to get him
to the hospital.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.447
Tell them he had
a tonic-clonic seizure

05:31.531 --> 05:33.165
and I gave him 4 milligrams
of Lorazepam.

05:33.232 --> 05:34.733
Can you do that for me,
please?

05:34.784 --> 05:36.201
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.037
Just doing my job.
Go.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.757
[Applause]
Well, that was exciting.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.592
Don't eat the fish.

06:00.747 --> 06:02.331
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:04.451 --> 06:07.119
I haven't been back here
since...

06:07.171 --> 06:08.721
[Sighs]

06:08.788 --> 06:11.174
It's really all gone,
isn't it?

06:11.258 --> 06:13.142
Found a few snow globes
you might be able to salvage.

06:13.227 --> 06:15.011
Other than that...

06:16.814 --> 06:20.066
It's good to see you again, Fi.

06:22.069 --> 06:23.402
I don't know
what Strong told you, but--

06:23.470 --> 06:25.071
[door creaks]

06:25.138 --> 06:28.691
Oh, you must be
Fiona Glenanne.

06:28.775 --> 06:30.976
Hello.

06:31.028 --> 06:32.645
Fi, this is Sonya.

06:32.696 --> 06:33.936
Michael speaks
so highly of you,

06:33.980 --> 06:36.499
I'd swear he was trying
to make me jealous.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.701
He told me what you did
to help get me out of Cuba.

06:38.785 --> 06:39.952
Thank you.

06:40.003 --> 06:41.487
I hope he also told you

06:41.538 --> 06:43.489
that my help doesn't come cheap.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.875
That won't be an issue.

06:45.959 --> 06:49.929
You'll find that my people
are very generous.

06:49.996 --> 06:52.498
Sam and Jesse
are already inside.

06:52.549 --> 06:56.519
Shall we?

06:56.603 --> 06:58.971
Some information
on our target.

06:59.022 --> 07:00.723
Where's all this coming from
exactly?

07:00.807 --> 07:02.441
All that matters
is that it's here.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.009
The surveillance fairy.
Right, I forgot.

07:04.061 --> 07:06.562
The hackers work out of this
building on Biscayne Boulevard.

07:06.647 --> 07:08.948
We need to get into their
mainframe and plant the virus

07:09.015 --> 07:11.016
that Michael and I acquired
yesterday.

07:11.068 --> 07:13.703
Yeah, so this virus
that you acquired,

07:13.787 --> 07:14.904
how does that work exactly?

07:14.988 --> 07:16.405
It sends us their data

07:16.490 --> 07:17.650
and wipes their drives clean.

07:17.691 --> 07:19.242
It says here
that this guy Cody Ward

07:19.326 --> 07:21.494
is in charge
of finding new talent.

07:21.545 --> 07:23.195
We could start
by approaching him.

07:23.247 --> 07:25.030
You want to get in
as an employee?

07:25.082 --> 07:26.299
What do you know
about hacking?

07:26.366 --> 07:28.167
Not much,
but if it's our only way in,

07:28.218 --> 07:30.253
we'll fake it.
You can't just fake it.

07:30.337 --> 07:32.037
Sure we can.
Mike goes in,

07:32.089 --> 07:33.890
does a little typie-type
on the keyboard,

07:33.974 --> 07:35.341
we do something
in the real world

07:35.392 --> 07:36.726
that makes him look
like a computer genius.

07:36.810 --> 07:39.211
You'll need
top-grade hacking software,

07:39.263 --> 07:40.379
and even if you convince them,

07:40.430 --> 07:41.751
one demonstration
won't be enough.

07:41.815 --> 07:43.399
They'll want to see evidence
of your past work.

07:43.483 --> 07:45.101
We know someone
who might be able to help us,

07:45.185 --> 07:46.569
a local money launderer.

07:46.653 --> 07:47.853
He does
some computer security work.

07:47.905 --> 07:49.272
I'm sure I could put something
together.

07:49.356 --> 07:50.723
Barry?

07:50.774 --> 07:53.693
Uh, yeah, he's not real happy
with us right now.

07:53.744 --> 07:55.111
You'll be able
to talk him into it.

07:55.195 --> 07:56.746
Buy him a fruity drink.

07:56.830 --> 07:59.282
Oh, is that all?

08:01.868 --> 08:03.419
We just need a paper trail
to make it look

08:03.503 --> 08:04.703
like some accounts got hacked.

08:04.738 --> 08:05.788
You could do it
in your sleep, man.

08:05.872 --> 08:07.112
And if you could
also hook us up

08:07.174 --> 08:08.374
with whatever hacker software

08:08.425 --> 08:09.408
the kids are using these days,

08:09.459 --> 08:10.760
that would be swell.

08:10.844 --> 08:13.045
Um, what possible reason
could you have

08:13.096 --> 08:14.046
for wanting all that?

08:14.097 --> 08:15.431
Well, it's no big deal.

08:15.515 --> 08:17.216
Mike's just going
after some computer monkeys.

08:17.267 --> 08:19.802
They call themselves--
The Collective.

08:19.886 --> 08:21.804
- The Collective.
- The Collective?

08:21.888 --> 08:23.773
Are you high?
They're the friggin' plague.

08:23.857 --> 08:25.191
They've been hitting
my clients for years.

08:25.258 --> 08:26.642
No way.
Barry, none of this

08:26.727 --> 08:28.861
is gonna blow back on you, man.
That's very reassuring

08:28.928 --> 08:30.646
coming from the team
who got me sent to prison.

08:30.731 --> 08:32.898
Hey.
Mike got you a pardon.

08:32.950 --> 08:35.368
After four months.
Plenty of time to ruin my life.

08:35.434 --> 08:36.769
I lost my girlfriend.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.571
I lost my house.

08:38.621 --> 08:40.323

18:10.206 --> 18:11.823
That's Tricia's car!

18:11.908 --> 18:14.609
I bought her that car
for her birthday last year!

18:14.660 --> 18:17.295
She loved that car.
She never would have sold it.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.830
What, do you think
it was stolen?

18:18.915 --> 18:20.548
So, Barry, look,
I talked to a cop buddy.

18:20.616 --> 18:22.617
That dealership
is known for its ties

18:22.668 --> 18:24.085
to some serious bad guys.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.638
Bad guys.
W-what kind of bad guys?

18:26.722 --> 18:28.590
The kind of guys
who fence cars,

18:28.641 --> 18:31.125
cars that are linked
to more than one disappearance.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.761
- Oh, no.
- Listen. Listen.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.796
All we know is we gotta go ask
Mr. Sleazy Pants

18:34.847 --> 18:37.565
over there some questions.
Let's go.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.937
Afternoon.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.638
You boys buying or selling?

18:43.689 --> 18:45.156
Neither actually.

18:45.241 --> 18:46.608
We just wanted to ask you
a few questions

18:46.659 --> 18:49.077
about how that Lamborghini there
ended up on your lot.

18:49.144 --> 18:50.779
You guys cops?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.948
You see any badges?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.332
We just need some information,
that's all.

18:54.417 --> 18:55.667
Then go to a library.

18:55.751 --> 18:57.452
You got five seconds
to get off my lot.

18:57.503 --> 18:58.870
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

18:58.955 --> 19:00.956
Yeah, I think it is.

19:01.007 --> 19:01.990
- Really?
- [Exclaims]

19:02.041 --> 19:04.209
[Screams]

19:04.293 --> 19:06.094
Now let's try this
one more time.

19:06.161 --> 19:09.163
Who brought in the Lambo?
Go to hell.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.182
Low prices, huh?

19:11.267 --> 19:14.769
You may have to lower 'em
just a little bit more.

19:14.837 --> 19:16.805
- Ooh!
- That's a $50,000 car.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.841
That was a $50,000 car.
It's more like $45,000 now.

19:19.892 --> 19:20.892
Let's go for $40,000.

19:20.977 --> 19:22.510
Stop!

19:22.561 --> 19:24.512
[Yelling]
Tell us...

19:24.563 --> 19:25.847
Who...
Jesus.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.516
Brought it...
In!

19:28.567 --> 19:30.318
Okay, okay!

19:30.369 --> 19:32.153
But you gotta keep me
out of it.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.571
His name's Pike.

19:33.656 --> 19:35.373
He gets me cars sometimes.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.859
Always cash.
No questions.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.128
He's a dangerous son of a bitch,
okay?

19:40.195 --> 19:42.196
That's all I know.
Swear to God.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.214
That's all
we wanted to know.

19:43.299 --> 19:45.917
Thanks for your time.

19:46.002 --> 19:47.368
Just calm down,
for God's sake.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.422
My goodness.

19:50.506 --> 19:53.091
When you need access
to a restricted area

19:53.175 --> 19:55.310
and you know
you're being watched closely,

19:55.377 --> 19:56.811
a direct approach is best.

19:56.879 --> 19:58.980
Sneaking around
when you're under surveillance

19:59.048 --> 20:00.598
just arouses suspicion.

20:00.683 --> 20:02.984
Incoming, 9:00.

20:03.052 --> 20:04.886
The key is to act
like you're doing nothing wrong.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.571
Hey.
Hey, hey.

20:06.655 --> 20:08.189
Guys, where you going?

20:08.240 --> 20:10.075
I'll give you a hint.
It's flat, sunny,

20:10.159 --> 20:11.559
and on top of the building.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.861
No way, dude.
Roof's off-limits.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.195
We're just going
for a smoke break.

20:14.246 --> 20:15.864
I'm sorry.
No one's allowed up there.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.449
Besides,
why are you guys taking breaks

20:17.533 --> 20:19.084
when you have accounts
to work on?

20:19.168 --> 20:21.119
I have a password cracker

20:21.203 --> 20:23.455
attacking the Cayman Islands
World Bank as we speak.

20:23.539 --> 20:25.507
It's either gonna take
two minutes or two hours.

20:25.574 --> 20:26.674
Either way,
it's not gonna go any faster

20:26.742 --> 20:28.043
with me staring at it.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.377
I'll put it simply.

20:29.428 --> 20:30.668
I need to go
through those doors

20:30.713 --> 20:32.246
and upstairs to the roof,

20:32.298 --> 20:33.465
so I can have
a smoke break.

20:33.549 --> 20:34.749
So maybe try the patch.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.518
I need a smoke.
I need to go outside.

20:36.585 --> 20:37.969
I need to go out that door
and up the stairs--

20:38.054 --> 20:39.437
- Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark--
- I can't work like this.

20:39.522 --> 20:40.588
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.391
[Sighs]

20:45.361 --> 20:48.029
Security can't escort us
down eight floors

20:48.097 --> 20:50.365
every time he needs
a cigarette.

20:50.432 --> 20:52.767
And you don't want to see him
in withdrawal.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.436
Cody, come on.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.739
Cody.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.458
Okay, but make it quick.
You have work to do.

21:00.543 --> 21:02.944
Tell me about it.

21:09.085 --> 21:11.119
[Metal clinks]

21:18.761 --> 21:21.012
Shall we?

21:32.108 --> 21:35.243
Okay, Fiona, the wire should
be about a foot to your left.

21:35.310 --> 21:37.979
As a rule,
the faster a drill turns,

21:38.030 --> 21:39.948
the louder it is.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.399
That's why drills
used in covert Ops

21:41.450 --> 21:43.001
have special gear boxes

21:43.085 --> 21:44.819
that move at low speeds.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.287
With the right drill bit,

21:46.338 --> 21:48.256
they can still get
through most walls,

21:48.323 --> 21:51.543
though it may take a minute
or two to do it.

22:05.674 --> 22:08.526
Okay, we're hooking up
your little device now.

22:08.611 --> 22:09.727
[Device beeps]

22:09.812 --> 22:13.531
Sonya,
you getting anything?

22:13.616 --> 22:15.183
Yeah. Got it.
We're good.

22:15.234 --> 22:16.401
Now hurry up
and get back inside.

22:16.485 --> 22:17.452
[Metal scrapes]

22:17.519 --> 22:22.356
What was that?

22:22.408 --> 22:24.459
Aah!
Michael!

22:25.828 --> 22:27.662
Fi!

22:37.423 --> 22:39.591
We'll do this together.

22:42.228 --> 22:44.545
I got you.
I got you.

22:46.932 --> 22:48.266
I can't lose you.

22:48.350 --> 22:50.268
[Crying]

22:57.193 --> 23:01.279
[Both grunting]

23:04.533 --> 23:08.870
Hang on.

23:40.202 --> 23:42.120
Thanks.

23:42.204 --> 23:44.656
Don't mention it.

23:46.441 --> 23:48.910
We should go inside.

23:51.838 --> 23:53.488
At this point, there are
no technical issues

23:53.539 --> 23:55.590
to keep you
from getting in.

23:55.658 --> 23:56.508
We have the password
to the server room,

23:56.592 --> 23:58.126
the log-in to their network,

23:58.177 --> 24:00.879
and I can override the cameras
to cover your path

24:00.964 --> 24:03.298
down the back staircase
and into this hall here.

24:03.349 --> 24:05.133
So what's the problem?

24:05.184 --> 24:08.553
Him.
Cody never stops moving.

24:08.638 --> 24:10.439
He buzzes around looking
over everybody's shoulder

24:10.506 --> 24:11.773
to check their progress.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.108
It'll take you 20 minutes

24:13.175 --> 24:15.110
to plant the virus
in the server room.

24:15.177 --> 24:17.696
The longest I've seen him leave
anybody alone is six minutes.

24:17.780 --> 24:19.281
We have to get rid of him.

24:19.348 --> 24:20.365
I'll call Fi.

24:20.450 --> 24:22.150
He hits on her
every time he sees her.

24:22.201 --> 24:25.120
I'm sure she can entice him
out of the office.

24:25.187 --> 24:27.205
Are you sure you're okay
with her doing that?

24:27.290 --> 24:29.908
Why wouldn't I be?

24:29.993 --> 24:33.128
She was your girlfriend.

24:33.195 --> 24:36.081
It wasn't hard
to figure out.

24:36.165 --> 24:41.386
You don't strike me
as a snow globe collector.

24:41.471 --> 24:43.472
That was a long time ago.

24:43.539 --> 24:46.892
Now our relationship
is strictly professional.

24:48.511 --> 24:49.544
Was it nice?

24:49.595 --> 24:52.881
What?

24:52.932 --> 24:55.017
Being with someone.

24:57.103 --> 24:59.104
I just always wondered
what it would be like

24:59.188 --> 25:01.656
to have a personal life
as well as a professional one.

25:04.911 --> 25:08.830
I'm not sure
if I ever had that, really.

25:14.871 --> 25:19.207
Trying to
causes a lot of pain.

25:20.793 --> 25:23.378
Was it worth it?

25:23.429 --> 25:25.881
Honestly, I don't know.

25:28.768 --> 25:31.720
Call me
when you're in position.

25:31.771 --> 25:34.106
Okay.

25:35.691 --> 25:38.560
So is this the place?

25:38.611 --> 25:40.645
Yes, Barry,
this is the place.

25:40.730 --> 25:42.364
What are we waiting for?
That son of a bitch

25:42.431 --> 25:43.565
might know where Tricia is.

25:43.616 --> 25:45.734
Let's go kick in a door already.

25:45.785 --> 25:47.152
What are we doing here?

25:47.236 --> 25:48.820
Tricia could be
in some serious trouble.

25:48.905 --> 25:50.956
Look, your cop buddy
said that this guy

25:51.040 --> 25:52.874
has got a rap sheet
a mile long.

His name's Pike,
for God's sake.

through a lot right now.

25:56.579 --> 25:58.446

to shut your hole.

25:58.498 --> 26:01.049
Thank you.
[Car beeps]

26:04.170 --> 26:06.621
Uhoh, looks like someone's
going on a road trip.

26:06.672 --> 26:08.557
What?

26:10.226 --> 26:11.292
What?

26:11.344 --> 26:13.011
No, he's not just going
on a road trip.

26:13.096 --> 26:15.797
He's loading guns
into the back of his car.

26:15.848 --> 26:18.633

must have tipped him off.

We got to go in there now.

26:20.302 --> 26:21.520
No, we need
to go in there.

26:21.604 --> 26:23.321
You need to stay here
until we figure out

26:23.406 --> 26:26.575
what the hell is going on.

26:30.446 --> 26:33.481
How you doing?
Get your hands on the truck.

26:33.533 --> 26:35.283

- Who are you?
- Oh, that's not important.

26:36.702 --> 26:38.319
What is important--
Hey, you son of a bitch.

26:38.371 --> 26:40.255
Barry, damn it, I told you
to stay in the car.

26:40.322 --> 26:42.841
- [Grunts]
- Hey.

26:42.925 --> 26:44.876
- Ooh!
- All right.

26:44.961 --> 26:46.761
Now that we got the cardio
out of the way,

26:46.829 --> 26:48.130
let's have a conversation.

26:48.181 --> 26:49.264
Yeah, and you can start
by telling us

26:49.331 --> 26:50.265
what the hell you did
to Tricia.

26:50.332 --> 26:52.667
Wait.
Jesus.

aren't you?

26:55.304 --> 26:56.171
Yeah.
How do you know?

26:56.222 --> 26:58.690
Tricia's my girlfriend.

26:58.774 --> 27:00.308
Uh, Barry, I think--

27:00.359 --> 27:02.677
- You're a liar.
- I'm not lying to you.

Well, then why did we just
catch you skipping town?

Skipping town?
What are you talking about?

on vacation.

Oh, really?

Not a--not a rifle.

Yeah, okay,
but you stole her car.

27:19.662 --> 27:21.580
Stole it?
I dumped it.

27:21.664 --> 27:23.798
Tricia never wanted
an orange Lamborghini.

27:23.866 --> 27:25.834
You did.
Yeah, well, she-

27:25.885 --> 27:27.302
That's how we met.

27:27.369 --> 27:29.337

unload it for cash.

ask her yourself?

- Sorry about--that's our bad.

start laying those golden eggs.

help me blow off a little steam?
