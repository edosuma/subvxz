<i>Madame Durand?</i>

01:08.137 --> 01:11.055
<i>Je peux vous aider à vous asseoir?</i>

01:12.859 --> 01:14.892
<i>Voilà, c'est mieux.</i>

01:21.034 --> 01:22.700
<i>Arretez de me droguer.</i>

01:22.735 --> 01:24.485
<i>Ce n'est pas gentil.</i>

01:24.570 --> 01:27.238
<i>Vous devez prendre
vos médicaments. Allez.</i>

01:35.248 --> 01:37.998
<i>Je vous en prie. Ce n'est pas juste.</i>

01:38.084 --> 01:40.584
<i>Vous devez prendre vos médicaments.</i>

02:41.147 --> 02:43.447
Okay, how about these guys?

02:43.483 --> 02:45.783
They... They look like
they could handle the track.

03:00.133 --> 03:02.249
Can I get you cereal or toast?

03:02.335 --> 03:04.051
- Toast.
- Okay.

03:05.244 --> 03:08.829
You... want to say good morning
to your father?

03:08.954 --> 03:10.870
Morning, Daddy.

03:18.551 --> 03:21.302
Can you tell Nicky good morning?

03:21.521 --> 03:23.737
I found a place.

03:25.488 --> 03:26.904
You don't have to leave.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.707
Well, I'm trying to get
the lease signed this week.

03:29.742 --> 03:30.908
You don't have to.

03:30.933 --> 03:33.461
- She's gone now. We can start over.
- Oh.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.379
Oh, you know, that's what you said

03:35.415 --> 03:36.914
when you brought the woman
into this house...

03:36.999 --> 03:38.466
- some immigrant from Haiti.
- Don't.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.384
You know, I could've told you
how that was gonna go,

03:40.420 --> 03:41.635
but you have all the answers.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.771
- D-Don't do this in front of Nicky.
- Well, then don't shove him in my face.

03:44.995 --> 03:47.430
You know? You want a reaction?

03:47.493 --> 03:48.626
You got one.

03:56.067 --> 03:58.414
_

04:14.654 --> 04:16.687
It's Kimara.

04:22.835 --> 04:24.460
Dustin...

04:25.906 --> 04:27.615
They won't let me leave.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.033
Nobody's keeping you
from going anywhere...

04:29.118 --> 04:30.534
Then how come
they won't just let me leave?

04:30.586 --> 04:31.702
Because you're a minor.

04:31.754 --> 04:32.788
They want to make sure

04:32.852 --> 04:35.320
that you actually have
someplace safe to go.

04:35.814 --> 04:37.748
Do you have anywhere to go?

04:42.065 --> 04:43.864
Before, when I asked you

04:43.950 --> 04:46.384
if there was somebody
you wanted us to call

04:46.419 --> 04:49.003
or somebody to be able
to get in touch with you,

04:49.072 --> 04:50.998
you didn't say anything.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.308
Do you want me to call somebody for you?

04:54.394 --> 04:55.426
No.

04:55.511 --> 04:57.745
Do you want me
to talk to the people here

04:57.830 --> 05:00.047
about giving you a bus voucher?

05:02.432 --> 05:05.116
Look, Dustin, I'm gonna be leaving soon.

05:06.148 --> 05:08.272
They're gonna assign you
a new caseworker.

05:08.307 --> 05:10.141
You don't care.

05:10.193 --> 05:11.966
What am I supposed to do?

05:12.083 --> 05:15.489
You call, I come.
I come, you don't say nothing.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.482
Something's bothering you.

05:26.566 --> 05:30.347
If you want my help, you have my number.

05:31.175 --> 05:33.589
I'll be around till the end of the week.

05:57.474 --> 06:00.208
Why don't you just have a sip or two?

06:09.602 --> 06:11.324
<i>Hello?</i>

06:11.889 --> 06:13.455
<i>Jeanette?</i>

06:13.540 --> 06:15.795
Can I come see you?

06:16.226 --> 06:17.742
<i>For what?</i>

06:18.326 --> 06:21.546
I want to come and... talk.

06:25.369 --> 06:26.518
Please.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.280
I really need to talk to you.

06:30.262 --> 06:33.091
<i>Yeah. We can talk.</i>

06:35.979 --> 06:37.779
Raelyn's back in jail.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.931
She failed a drug test.

06:40.788 --> 06:42.673
It's not a big surprise, is it?

06:42.769 --> 06:44.819
Well, she keeps saying it was a mistake.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.154
They make mistakes... sometimes.

06:48.636 --> 06:50.639
What's gonna happen to her?

06:51.195 --> 06:52.527
Parole violation.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.462
She's got to go before a judge,

06:54.548 --> 06:58.533
but they could give her
18 months, at least, so...

06:58.702 --> 07:00.535
I got to figure out
how to keep things going.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.771
You need money.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.740
I need to come home.

07:08.212 --> 07:11.747
And all that talk about
trying to find yourself,

07:11.841 --> 07:13.661
trying to "breathe" and...

07:13.903 --> 07:15.802
wanting to taking a stand
for the workers,

07:15.927 --> 07:18.520
that just... goes away?

07:22.443 --> 07:24.910
What's it gonna be like
when you're back?

07:28.290 --> 07:30.707
- It's gonna be like it was.
- No, it won't.

07:30.801 --> 07:33.268
I-I'm gonna be there for you.
I will support you...

07:33.353 --> 07:35.120
You're gonna be a housewife,

07:35.205 --> 07:39.077
the same thing that set you off before.

07:39.264 --> 07:42.811
And the minute you feel
disrespected, you leave again.

07:45.186 --> 07:48.950
I need to take custody

07:49.442 --> 07:51.442
of Raelyn's girls.

07:51.601 --> 07:52.921
We need to do it.

07:53.363 --> 07:54.812
You asked...

07:55.028 --> 07:57.125
You asked if we should've had kids...

07:57.219 --> 07:58.243
Yeah, our own kids.

07:58.289 --> 08:00.937
...if we should've been about
something bigger than us.

08:00.964 --> 08:03.758
- Our own children.
- Well, they need help.

08:08.672 --> 08:09.971
For how long?

08:10.397 --> 08:12.107
Until Raelyn's healthy?

08:13.998 --> 08:16.576
For as long as it takes.

08:19.419 --> 08:22.250
You have to talk to Laurie Ann.

08:27.574 --> 08:30.008
You are talking about
a financial arrangement.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.760
Taking care of our nieces.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.432
Yeah, and if you didn't need
the money to do it,

08:33.501 --> 08:34.916
you wouldn't be here.

08:35.001 --> 08:36.467
I'm not as...

08:37.416 --> 08:39.841
strong as I thought. I can't...

08:40.053 --> 08:42.404
I can't deal with things
like I thought, so...

08:43.607 --> 08:45.813
I am here and...

08:46.159 --> 08:49.377
I want to admit to what I did,

08:49.938 --> 08:52.657
or what I did wrong, or... or...

08:53.740 --> 08:55.662
- how I hurt you.
- Stop.

08:55.740 --> 09:00.171
But I am here, and I will do
whatever I have to...

09:00.257 --> 09:02.176
- St...
- ...to stay.

09:02.269 --> 09:05.276
- Stop it. Please, just stop it.
- Please, Carson...

09:14.037 --> 09:15.932
I loved you with all my heart.

09:16.190 --> 09:18.023
I really did.

09:18.284 --> 09:21.576
Not one day, not one time

09:21.776 --> 09:24.114
did I ever treat you wrong.

09:25.130 --> 09:27.848
Never deserved what you did to me.

09:32.053 --> 09:34.439
Laurie Ann'll understand all this.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.757
All she cares about is business, too.

10:18.135 --> 10:19.601
Hi. Can I help you?

10:20.613 --> 10:22.856
Can I exchange this
for a ticket somewhere else?

10:22.949 --> 10:24.395
Round trip?

10:24.932 --> 10:26.131
How far can I get on that?

10:26.198 --> 10:27.858
How far? Where do you want to go?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.989
Where you looking to get to?

10:41.324 --> 10:43.272
<i>Hello?</i>

10:43.927 --> 10:45.499
It's Dustin.

10:48.546 --> 10:49.858
I need help.

10:50.140 --> 10:51.866
The man who ran the webcam house...

10:51.952 --> 10:52.883
what's the name?

10:52.953 --> 10:54.002
Everett Castro.

10:54.951 --> 10:56.771
How many people in the house?

10:56.865 --> 10:58.139
How many kids?

10:58.357 --> 11:01.359
Jeremy, Tracy, Sugar...
Couple other kids.

11:01.445 --> 11:02.710
Wait, wait. "Sugar"?

11:02.746 --> 11:04.681
I don't know Sugar's real name.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.849
What happened in the house?

11:12.397 --> 11:14.519
It was an accident.

11:17.011 --> 11:18.343
What happened?

11:20.386 --> 11:22.530
Tracy stabbed the other girl.

11:22.942 --> 11:24.866
- Who?
- Cassi.

11:26.418 --> 11:28.403
Everett got rid of the body.

11:29.153 --> 11:31.356
Got rid of it how?

11:31.591 --> 11:33.141
Dumped it in the river.

11:33.794 --> 11:37.111
Well, what about this Cassi?
Uh, y-you know where she's from?

11:37.164 --> 11:38.279
She got family?

11:38.331 --> 11:39.809
No.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.096
She has a boyfriend, her pimp.

11:48.391 --> 11:50.525
That wasn't her name.

11:50.846 --> 11:54.110
That's her... That's her screen name.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.147
Her name was Shae.

11:58.869 --> 12:00.068
What?

12:01.049 --> 12:02.248
Shae.

12:02.402 --> 12:03.872
Tell me about her.

12:03.907 --> 12:06.465
She... I don't know.

12:06.605 --> 12:09.016
Well... Well, like...
Well, what did she look like?

12:09.246 --> 12:11.162
Regular. Blonde.

12:14.918 --> 12:16.501
Was she pregnant?

12:18.388 --> 12:19.671
Yeah.

12:20.312 --> 12:21.656
Where did this happen?

12:21.726 --> 12:24.008
Tell me where the house is
that it happened.

14:33.888 --> 14:35.224
- Mrs. Coates?
- Mm-hmm.

14:35.294 --> 14:36.849
- Appreciate you coming in.
- Absolutely.

14:36.908 --> 14:38.083
Uh, this is Ms. Shepard.

14:38.126 --> 14:40.393
Is it all right if she stays
with Nicky while we talk?

14:40.445 --> 14:41.778
Oh, he's fine with me.

14:41.863 --> 14:43.648
Well, the conversation
might be a bit more sensitive

14:43.710 --> 14:45.070
than you want him to be a part of.

14:45.156 --> 14:47.767
- Uh...
- Uh, he'll be right here when we finish.

14:47.853 --> 14:50.072
Okay, Nicky, you're gonna stay here.
I'll be right back, okay?

14:50.182 --> 14:52.236
Okay. Mm-hmm.

14:52.758 --> 14:55.017
- Appreciate your time, Mrs. Coates.
- Mm-hmm.

14:55.431 --> 14:57.980
The night we took Gabrielle into custody,

14:58.073 --> 15:00.916
when you made your statement
regarding her physical condition,

15:00.983 --> 15:02.790
you said her injuries
were self-inflicted.

15:02.904 --> 15:04.954
Now, you saw her hurt herself?

15:05.087 --> 15:06.786
I-I didn't see all of it.

15:06.839 --> 15:10.665
I-I would see, you know,
the cuts, and, um...

15:10.859 --> 15:13.291
you know, the other, uh...

15:13.432 --> 15:14.994
You know, after a while,

15:15.080 --> 15:17.010
y-you can figure out
where they're coming from.

15:17.656 --> 15:20.353
Could you look at these photos
of Gabrielle?

15:20.705 --> 15:24.054
Now, these, uh, injuries
all look familiar to you?

15:24.139 --> 15:25.305
Yes.

15:25.340 --> 15:27.649
These, and, uh, these on her arms here?

15:27.719 --> 15:29.910
- And, uh, these?
- Yes.

15:30.274 --> 15:31.969
Mm-hmm.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.365
These injuries were in
the middle of Gabrielle's back.

15:35.450 --> 15:38.865
That's a very difficult place
for someone to injure themselves.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.230
Uh-huh. Hmm.

15:41.255 --> 15:43.537
Now, you said, um, Gabrielle had family.

15:43.592 --> 15:45.792
- Is that right?
- Yes.

15:45.827 --> 15:48.037
She has a son, Yves.

15:48.288 --> 15:51.595
They're... I think I told you
they're estranged.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.502
And I think...

15:53.902 --> 15:57.198
I really think
that's what was making her...

15:57.493 --> 16:01.956
You know, not having family,
seeing our family when...

16:02.294 --> 16:03.793
things aren't well in one's life,

16:03.879 --> 16:05.712
and you see people
who have what you don't,

16:05.797 --> 16:08.056
that can... that can cause you damage.

16:08.223 --> 16:10.606
Was Gabrielle in contact with her son?

16:10.786 --> 16:12.205
No.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.516
You know, well,

16:13.587 --> 16:16.089
she would write these letters
that she didn't send.

16:16.402 --> 16:18.742
I asked her, "Why...
Why are you writing letters

16:18.827 --> 16:21.845
that you won't send?" And, um...

16:21.930 --> 16:24.833
She said she was writing them to God.

16:25.679 --> 16:27.517
- Her son is...
- I... You know what I think?

16:27.603 --> 16:28.968
When people talk about God,

16:29.022 --> 16:32.507
they either have a lot of faith
or a lot of problems.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.225
Hmm.

16:35.429 --> 16:36.931
Mrs. Coates...

16:37.337 --> 16:40.525
Gabrielle's son
arrived here a few days ago.

16:45.698 --> 16:47.965
Yves received some letters
from Gabrielle.

16:48.056 --> 16:50.630
Can I... show you a letter?

16:50.716 --> 16:52.075
It's, uh, in French.

16:52.160 --> 16:55.340
Can you read what Gabrielle says in that?

17:08.270 --> 17:09.540
Yeah.

17:09.665 --> 17:11.837
Mrs. Coates, you don't have to
tell me anything else.

17:11.945 --> 17:14.164
You don't have to speak
to anybody but a lawyer.

17:14.249 --> 17:15.604
That's your right.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.196
I need to call my husband.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.596
They're here, uh, right now.

17:21.657 --> 17:24.174
Uh, they have a search warrant,
and they want to look in the house.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.963
Do I have to let them in?

17:26.040 --> 17:28.278
<i>If they have a search
warrant, they can come in the house.</i>

17:28.363 --> 17:29.979
Well, that... that woman's crazy.

17:30.064 --> 17:32.720
I mean, why the hell the police
want to be searching my house?

17:32.838 --> 17:34.584
<i>- Did you pay her?</i>
- Of course I paid her.

17:34.670 --> 17:36.202
<i>Show the police proof of that.</i>

17:36.254 --> 17:38.305
<i>They'll be looking
for evidence of coercion,</i>

17:38.390 --> 17:39.954
<i>withholding I.D. papers,</i>

17:40.040 --> 17:41.814
<i>locks on the place
where the woman slept.</i>

17:41.892 --> 17:43.643
<i>- Did she have her own room, her own bed?</i>
- Yeah, look, look, here's...

17:43.695 --> 17:45.645
We... We didn't do
anything wrong, all right?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.314
We treated her decent, and...

17:47.702 --> 17:49.316
I mean, is that what this has come to?

17:49.368 --> 17:50.867
I mean, these people
get to say what they want,

17:50.952 --> 17:52.986
the police believe them, not us?

17:53.071 --> 17:54.874
<i>Is there something to hide?</i>

17:57.373 --> 17:58.588
She stayed in here?

17:58.670 --> 18:00.467
It's a nice room. It's comfortable.

18:13.983 --> 18:15.700
There you go.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.611
Oh, uh, you know, uh, I'm... I'm sure

18:26.696 --> 18:28.870
Clair put that in there for safekeeping.

18:29.878 --> 18:31.766
And Gabrielle could've
gotten it any time.

18:34.621 --> 18:36.808
It's not a...

18:46.799 --> 18:48.783
Jeanette.

19:01.882 --> 19:05.536
Carson tells me you're taking on
your sister's girls.

19:05.618 --> 19:07.026
Yes.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.206
Well, that's good.

19:10.951 --> 19:12.815
I've always thought
that this family suffered from

19:12.893 --> 19:15.608
not having a next generation
to worry about.

19:16.429 --> 19:18.529
And if any of the three of us
has what it takes

19:18.565 --> 19:21.093
to... to raise a family, it's Carson.

19:22.473 --> 19:23.856
I hope so.

19:24.270 --> 19:25.820
I really do.

19:25.888 --> 19:27.038
We're gonna...

19:27.123 --> 19:29.473
put the past behind us and, uh,

19:29.525 --> 19:30.691
get things back to normal.

19:31.714 --> 19:33.488
Are you now?

19:34.747 --> 19:36.147
Yes.

19:37.454 --> 19:40.468
JD's gonna plead guilty
in court next week.

19:41.063 --> 19:44.238
He's gonna walk into a... a courtroom

19:44.324 --> 19:47.174
and confess his sins to the judge

19:47.260 --> 19:49.646
so that he will be shown mercy.

19:50.630 --> 19:52.677
An act of contrition.

19:53.633 --> 19:57.001
Everybody feels better when
the guilty renounce their ways.

20:00.241 --> 20:04.569
Did you make JD take the blame
for those workers being killed?

20:06.646 --> 20:10.704
I don't have as much control over life
as you'd like to believe.

20:11.539 --> 20:14.941
If I did, I would not
be watching our father pass

20:15.321 --> 20:18.512
or the business
that he built up crumble.

20:18.910 --> 20:21.525
And I would not be watching
our brother go to jail

20:22.114 --> 20:23.577
because the people in Raleigh

20:23.663 --> 20:26.168
don't have the will
to make things better.

20:29.402 --> 20:33.793
I am very sorry for
whatever bother I have caused.

20:33.863 --> 20:36.183
It was more than a "bother."

20:37.460 --> 20:40.391
There has been real hurt to us.

20:41.481 --> 20:43.867
- There has been real suffering.
- Mm.

20:44.790 --> 20:46.250
Mm.

20:51.724 --> 20:54.392
Those people who died... they suffered,

20:54.497 --> 20:56.610
and I'm not just talking about the fire.

20:56.888 --> 20:59.797
There was murder on the farm.
There was more than one.

20:59.822 --> 21:01.889
Women were assaulted...

21:01.959 --> 21:04.285
She doesn't know when to call it a day.

21:04.370 --> 21:06.858
I left for a while.
That's... That's all I did.

21:06.923 --> 21:10.074
People know why, or they think they do.

21:10.324 --> 21:12.924
They've come 'round,
they've asked questions,

21:13.062 --> 21:15.004
they've accused,

21:15.175 --> 21:17.058
and now when it's convenient for you to...

21:17.128 --> 21:19.707
Our situation is not convenient.

21:21.504 --> 21:24.902
- You of all people should not be...
- Our situation...

21:25.300 --> 21:27.132
...is not convenient.

21:27.238 --> 21:30.161
And there's nothing
about what Jeanette is doing

21:30.196 --> 21:31.696
that is easy.

21:31.856 --> 21:33.798
I want my wife back.

21:33.850 --> 21:35.708
I want a family.

21:35.989 --> 21:37.520
I know you want your pound of flesh.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.967
- I-I need this.
- I want something to hold on to.

21:40.044 --> 21:43.590
Everybody else... you, her, JD...

21:44.004 --> 21:47.396
you... you have had the luxury
of remove.

21:47.463 --> 21:50.181
You've had a comfortable distance

21:50.314 --> 21:53.314
from what's necessary to run a business.

21:54.002 --> 21:56.053
And I wouldn't change that.

21:56.345 --> 21:57.772
You're my brother.

21:58.392 --> 22:00.624
And I don't have a bad feeling

22:00.676 --> 22:03.470
about a single thing
that I have done to protect you.

22:04.938 --> 22:07.220
I can shoulder my weight.

22:07.867 --> 22:10.795
You carried what you could...

22:11.615 --> 22:14.506
and JD's carrying a lot more

22:14.574 --> 22:16.590
than he should ever have had to.

22:18.178 --> 22:21.744
Everybody in this family
earns their keep.

22:22.103 --> 22:23.971
And you're not gonna be any different

22:24.066 --> 22:27.736
just because you have finally
realized how much you need us.

22:31.357 --> 22:33.809
We are responsible people.

22:34.043 --> 22:36.903
We are responsible to the environment.

22:37.153 --> 22:40.950
We are responsible
in how we grow our product.

22:51.259 --> 22:54.618
I know a lot has been said about...

22:56.040 --> 22:59.183
about a very tragic event.

23:00.115 --> 23:03.905
And you all... you know me.

23:04.173 --> 23:06.186
You know I was here with you...

23:06.772 --> 23:08.437
...after that.

23:11.514 --> 23:13.597
What I can tell you...

23:14.233 --> 23:17.585
is that nobody was more upset
and concerned

23:17.679 --> 23:21.124
about what happened than the Hesbys.

23:22.265 --> 23:27.044
The Hesbys don't do these things
because they have to.

23:27.262 --> 23:30.074
We do them because they are right.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.816
And I can tell you...

23:33.764 --> 23:37.632
from my heart, I have never been so...

23:40.459 --> 23:43.678
I have never been...

23:43.781 --> 23:48.623
so proud to be a part of this family.

23:52.205 --> 23:54.606
- Got a date set with a judge.
- Mm.

23:54.841 --> 23:57.358
- Think you could be there?
- I don't know.

23:57.919 --> 23:59.727
Be good to have someone there.

23:59.812 --> 24:01.919
Be good if you weren't here.

24:02.982 --> 24:04.515
I talked to Carson.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.716
He's gonna help me with the girls.

24:07.047 --> 24:11.169
We're going to start the process
of becoming legal guardians.

24:12.058 --> 24:13.724
Okay.

24:14.807 --> 24:16.627
"Okay"? That's it?

24:17.813 --> 24:19.745
What do you want me to say?

24:20.182 --> 24:21.735
They're your daughters.

24:21.885 --> 24:24.184
Maybe you want to... I thought...

24:24.270 --> 24:26.391
you might want to fight for them some.

24:27.203 --> 24:29.540
Clearly, I can't take care of them.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.754
What... What you're doing...

24:31.878 --> 24:35.079
is the right thing.
It's good... It's a good thing.

24:35.114 --> 24:36.664
Mm. Nothing "good" about it.

24:36.965 --> 24:39.216
Laurie Ann's got me standing
in front of people,

24:39.268 --> 24:41.735
swearing on my life
how godly the farm is.

24:43.145 --> 24:45.122
Is that really so hard for you?

24:47.260 --> 24:49.810
Not so hard I won't do it.

24:50.309 --> 24:52.563
Were you ever gonna stay away from them?

24:54.941 --> 24:56.926
Were you really gonna work
for minimum wage

24:57.005 --> 24:59.253
the rest of your life?
You needed an excuse to go back.

24:59.338 --> 25:01.388
- No.
- I gave you one.

25:01.474 --> 25:03.710
You did me a favor?
You think you did me a favor?

25:03.781 --> 25:05.826
When you were out doing drugs,
is that what you thought?

25:05.912 --> 25:07.461
"Let me do something for Jeanette."

25:07.546 --> 25:09.563
I didn't plan none of this.

25:10.326 --> 25:13.052
Sometimes situations
just work out how they work out.

25:13.194 --> 25:15.982
Well, sometimes you need
to take responsibility.

25:25.865 --> 25:28.992
Why did you steal money when
you were working on the farm?

25:30.101 --> 25:32.601
I've said I'm sorry.
I've said it so many times...

25:32.671 --> 25:34.679
But you never said why you stole.

25:34.851 --> 25:36.874
Was it to buy drugs?

25:37.848 --> 25:40.816
I didn't buy $25,000 worth of drugs.

25:40.879 --> 25:44.281
For the girls? I would've given
you money for the girls.

25:45.309 --> 25:48.936
I... I need... I need to know
there was something to it

25:49.007 --> 25:51.897
besides you being messed up and greedy.

26:09.925 --> 26:11.208
Hey.

26:11.810 --> 26:15.334
I want you to do something
for your daughters.

26:15.572 --> 26:17.178
When you get out of here,

26:17.278 --> 26:19.256
I don't want you to come around

26:19.375 --> 26:21.309
unless you can stay clean.

26:26.325 --> 26:28.459
You got no sympathy...

26:29.450 --> 26:30.842
do you?

26:31.756 --> 26:33.313
Fresh out.

27:08.183 --> 27:11.151
Is there a process where I can...

27:11.362 --> 27:13.404
have her remains for burial?

27:13.722 --> 27:15.923
She's a homicide victim.

27:16.008 --> 27:17.474
Her body's evidence.

27:17.510 --> 27:18.892
It'll take a while.

27:45.909 --> 27:47.442
It was her?

27:47.690 --> 27:49.490
Yeah.

27:49.979 --> 27:51.995
What happened?

27:52.328 --> 27:53.794
She got in a fight.

27:53.868 --> 27:55.167
It was over money.

27:55.813 --> 27:57.862
Shae was trying
to get back with her pimp.

27:58.042 --> 28:00.884
She thought if she had money,
they could go have her baby together.

28:06.789 --> 28:08.365
Kimara, can I see you for a second?

28:08.444 --> 28:10.527
- What?
- Just for a second, please.

28:10.579 --> 28:11.912
What is it?

28:11.997 --> 28:13.680
Dustin, we're gonna have to
place you under arrest.

28:13.711 --> 28:14.842
Wait. What are you doing?

28:14.867 --> 28:15.780
- Kimara, stay out of it.
- I didn't kill her!

28:15.804 --> 28:16.835
What are you arresting him for?!

28:16.836 --> 28:17.968
- I didn't hurt Shae!
- What are you arresting him...

28:18.003 --> 28:19.578
- I didn't touch her!
- Just let me talk to him!

28:19.633 --> 28:21.745
All right, all right, I'll talk...
Okay? Just let me talk...

28:21.854 --> 28:23.891
Dustin was an accessory after the fact.

28:23.976 --> 28:26.528
He went for days without telling
anybody about the murder.

28:26.598 --> 28:28.011
Shae is dead.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.458
Her pimp is out of jail,

28:29.536 --> 28:32.015
the guy who dumped her body is gone,

28:32.219 --> 28:33.851
there's a house full of kids missing,

28:33.903 --> 28:35.652
and... and you're
putting Dustin in jail?

28:35.688 --> 28:38.254
Look, he goes in front of a judge,

28:38.321 --> 28:40.661
pleas out, he'll do maybe a year.

28:40.943 --> 28:42.526
And you're happy with that?

28:42.911 --> 28:44.981
Well, what were you gonna do?

28:45.200 --> 28:46.446
Put him in a shelter?

28:46.564 --> 28:47.690
Fuck you.

28:47.891 --> 28:50.017
- Kimara, we will find those kids.
- No.

28:50.126 --> 28:53.370
- We will get them help...
- No, seriously... go fuck yourself.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.653
Where's the boy?

29:18.981 --> 29:21.305
Children's Services has him.

29:30.183 --> 29:31.949
They're gonna arrest you.

29:37.373 --> 29:39.123
And then what?

29:41.027 --> 29:42.851
Our lawyer thinks we can settle

29:42.996 --> 29:45.367
and that that woman won't press charges.

29:47.812 --> 29:51.319
Do you... Do... Do you have any idea

29:52.271 --> 29:54.849
what you're costing me
with this insanity?

29:56.609 --> 29:57.825
There's no hiding this.

29:57.910 --> 30:00.661
Oh, no. Th-This is gonna go
away like it never happened.

30:03.439 --> 30:05.124
It did happen.

30:09.188 --> 30:11.822
She mouthed off, hmm? You shoved her.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.750
She's got problems, she acted out.

30:13.843 --> 30:16.749
You... You tried
to contain a crazy person.

30:18.164 --> 30:22.031
I poured scalding water
on her skin... more than once.

30:22.609 --> 30:24.719
I remember the look on her face,

30:24.804 --> 30:26.805
how it made me feel, and...

30:27.006 --> 30:28.522
I felt...

30:28.641 --> 30:29.907
I just...

30:30.968 --> 30:33.351
I didn't... I wasn't thinking.

30:33.429 --> 30:35.880
I just did it. I just... I just, um...

30:38.284 --> 30:41.121
It was... It was done before
I could stop myself, and...

30:41.785 --> 30:43.954
there was, like, a white noise
playing in my mind...

30:43.990 --> 30:47.293
Get it together, Clair!
You do not get to cause any more damage.

30:50.713 --> 30:53.049
You're part of what happened.

30:53.596 --> 30:56.189
I-I didn't do anything to that woman.

30:56.536 --> 30:58.494
It's what you did to me.

30:58.650 --> 31:01.055
The... The... The hate, the contempt...

31:01.140 --> 31:04.210
Oh, so you're blaming me, uh, be...
you attacking the nanny?

31:04.276 --> 31:06.145
Uh, you're gonna blame me about that?

31:07.442 --> 31:10.559
You've been enraged at me
since I got pregnant.

31:10.949 --> 31:14.435
You have been punishing me
and our child ever since.

31:14.520 --> 31:19.096
You just had this... this
mocking and this hate and this...

31:19.292 --> 31:21.842
I mean, it's abuse.

31:23.450 --> 31:25.815
I never hurt you.

31:26.465 --> 31:28.032
Okay. You didn't touch me.

31:28.084 --> 31:30.090
You didn't touch me, Nicholas.

31:30.582 --> 31:32.536
But don't think you didn't hurt me.

31:39.078 --> 31:40.911
I'm gonna confess.

31:42.832 --> 31:45.377
- H-Hold on a second.
- I want to confess.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.439
Th-There's a way around it. I can fix it.

31:47.478 --> 31:48.361
No, you can't.

31:48.431 --> 31:50.171
- Yeah, I can... I can sell the company.
- No.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.771
You... You don't own the company anymore.

31:51.834 --> 31:54.325
Look, I... We throw enough
money at the woman...

31:54.350 --> 31:55.761
- I can't stand trial...
- Look, she's from Haiti.

31:55.842 --> 31:56.822
...and defend my actions.

31:56.885 --> 31:58.120
How... How much money do you
think it'll take her to go away?

31:58.172 --> 31:59.621
There's no protecting us.

32:00.066 --> 32:03.510
I... I need to stand
in front of a judge...

32:04.299 --> 32:06.299
- and admit to what I did.
- No, look, look.

32:06.355 --> 32:08.619
T-This isn't church, all right?
It's the law.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.369
There is a way around this.
We can work this out.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.327
- We...
- Listen to me!

32:14.537 --> 32:16.473
There's something you have to do.

32:18.536 --> 32:21.348
I'm gonna be going to jail for like

32:21.739 --> 32:23.705
two years or something like that,

32:23.815 --> 32:25.256
so you have to take care of Nicky.

32:29.309 --> 32:31.338
You need to take care of him.

32:32.331 --> 32:34.435
They will take him away from you.

32:34.801 --> 32:36.545
He's your child.

32:36.953 --> 32:40.443
He's your son, and even
if you can't love him...

32:41.155 --> 32:43.186
you have to take care of him.

Yves...

35:56.941 --> 35:59.112
I'm sorry about Shae.

35:59.503 --> 36:01.441
You did everything you could.

36:01.512 --> 36:03.559
And... And you know
you can't help someone

36:03.645 --> 36:04.894
who doesn't want to be helped.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.458
Mm. Yeah, at this point,

36:06.505 --> 36:09.020
I really don't know
where to put anybody's pity.

36:09.131 --> 36:10.678
It's, uh...

36:10.749 --> 36:13.444
I think it's good that
you're getting away for a while.

36:13.739 --> 36:16.241
Take your vacation and think about...

36:16.311 --> 36:18.148
you know,
about what you want to do next.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.449
I'm not going.

36:19.558 --> 36:21.007
Oh, no, take your time. You...

36:21.062 --> 36:22.687
I want to come work for you.

36:24.213 --> 36:25.446
Okay.

36:25.498 --> 36:27.753
That offer still stands, right?

36:27.878 --> 36:30.417
O-Of... Of course.
Of... Of course it does.

36:30.487 --> 36:34.080
I...I thought you had a problem

36:34.150 --> 36:36.447
- with the way that our planning...
- Had a problem with you

36:36.527 --> 36:38.916
getting me to lie to your man Greg.

36:40.930 --> 36:43.654
It was all worked out, right?
He was in on the deal?

36:43.731 --> 36:47.201
I was just the person in the
middle to give you both cover?

36:50.022 --> 36:52.439
I really don't care. I really don't.

36:52.525 --> 36:55.709
I just want to be clear
on the situation.

36:57.980 --> 36:59.954
We had an agreement, yeah.

37:00.723 --> 37:04.325
So, I'd like an agreement, too.

37:04.887 --> 37:07.696
Okay, well, we talked about...

37:12.524 --> 37:15.744
I think we can get you
$8,000 a year more...

37:15.806 --> 37:17.164
$15,000.

37:17.775 --> 37:19.850
I want $15,000 more.

37:19.935 --> 37:21.235
Well, that's a sizable
difference than what...

37:21.270 --> 37:22.486
$15,000.

37:23.882 --> 37:26.648
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.

37:26.876 --> 37:28.364
I would have to take money away from...

37:28.425 --> 37:29.925
Just say yes, Abby.

37:30.187 --> 37:31.887
For everybody's sake.

37:35.904 --> 37:38.309
I wanted better things.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.462
Okay.

37:41.918 --> 37:44.308
You can be a cynic
and have a heart of gold.

37:44.393 --> 37:45.826
I meant that when I said it.

37:45.878 --> 37:48.462
I am right there with you. I really am.

37:48.821 --> 37:51.813
Because I... I don't really care

37:51.923 --> 37:54.907
about anybody else's intentions anymore.

37:55.121 --> 37:58.972
I just want to be sure
that they serve my purpose.

37:59.893 --> 38:01.442
How are you feeling?

38:01.830 --> 38:03.653
I'm feeling good.

38:03.955 --> 38:05.947
I'm happy to hear that.

38:06.365 --> 38:08.615
Obviously, we can make no guarantees,

38:08.693 --> 38:11.186
but there are any number of enhancements
we can add to your treatments

38:11.248 --> 38:12.717
to increase the likelihood of pregnancy.

38:12.778 --> 38:15.389
At this point,
I'm willing to try anything.

38:15.772 --> 38:17.157
If you need to,

38:17.250 --> 38:20.300
we can create a financial plan
specifically suited for you.

38:20.546 --> 38:23.140
I'm... good, actually.

38:23.304 --> 38:25.600
I think I have things worked out.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.579
All rise!

41:03.524 --> 41:05.525
We are here today for the purpose

41:05.577 --> 41:08.157
of seeing that justice is done...

41:08.907 --> 41:10.697
and done for all.

41:14.887 --> 41:16.753
Be seated.
