Lord Kaidu.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.683
Welcome to Cambulac.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.566
Kaidu!

03:14.402 --> 03:15.653
She needs you!

[wailing continues]

[wailing]

03:35.883 --> 03:39.219
[screaming] Get it out!
Get it out, please!

03:39.302 --> 03:41.388
[Kaidu] What is that?
[Shabkana] It will calm her.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.391
Take away the pain.
Prepare her.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.476
-Prepare?
-[sputters]

03:46.559 --> 03:49.521
It's the baby or her.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.398
No.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.358
[Kaidu mutters]

03:53.441 --> 03:55.443
[crying]

03:55.527 --> 03:57.695
Come on.
You have to push.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.948
You have to get it out.
Please.

04:00.032 --> 04:03.952
Tell Orus...
[softly] I love him.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.578
No, no, no.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.248
You can do this.
Push.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.457
You can push.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.794
Listen to your mother.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.255
-No!
-[Shabkana] They'll both die.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.382
[crying continues]

04:19.426 --> 04:22.595
[whispers] Kaidu... do it.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.681
[sniffles] Do it.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.359

05:10.811 --> 05:12.354
Not an exact fit.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.607
But it will do, for now.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.777
You look good!

05:21.029 --> 05:22.614
Genghis executed anyone

05:22.697 --> 05:25.533
who betrayed their masters
in hopes of reward.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.246
That's what I think about every time
I look at the Vice Regent.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.623
This is a means to an end, son.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.469
[Nayan] Vice Regent.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.179
Where is the Khan?

05:46.263 --> 05:47.764
[Ahmad] What is that?

05:47.847 --> 05:49.016
Gift.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.143
Blessed wine from His Holiness,
Pope Gregory.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.394
Where is the Khan?

05:52.477 --> 05:54.146
Why'd he send it here?

05:54.229 --> 05:56.648
He seeks an end
to our westward expansion.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.109
Where is the Khan?

06:00.152 --> 06:01.361
He's not here.

06:02.654 --> 06:03.655
Xanadu.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.534
You could have sent word
when I alerted you to my arrival.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.913
I never told the Khan you were coming.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.959
How did you think he would receive
this message from His Holiness?

06:16.043 --> 06:18.045
Did you think the Khan
would halt his troops?

06:18.128 --> 06:20.505
Stop the expansion
on the pope's mere suggestion?

06:20.588 --> 06:22.925
-No. [stammers]
-Exactly.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.303
You came to ask a question
and you already knew the answer.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.264
He would cast you out.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.434
You and your people...

06:34.436 --> 06:35.520
and your wine.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.691
He's going west.
Nothing will stop him.

06:39.774 --> 06:43.861
Kublai is a man of vision.
He will see a way.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.408
There is another question
you should be asking yourself.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.411
Can you make your own way?

06:52.829 --> 06:56.749
With he who wishes to remain
exclusively Mongol.

06:56.833 --> 07:01.004
-[Nayan sighs]
-He who wishes to quell all expansion.

07:03.048 --> 07:07.260
He who despises my pope, Christianity.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.973
The chasm between
myself and Kaidu is vast,

07:11.056 --> 07:12.640
and I don't like him.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.024
You turned on your Khan.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.525
[chuckles]

07:25.153 --> 07:26.529
Not so much turned...

07:29.616 --> 07:31.493
as come around.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.675
[Kublai] Xanadu.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.888
Something, is it not?

07:52.805 --> 07:54.141
It is.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.020
How far?

07:58.103 --> 08:00.563
We're not going to the city.
Come.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.063
[man 1] Gerel, have a drink.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.231
-Oh!
-[man 2] Here's to our ride to Xanadu.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.193
-Xanadu!
-[all cheering]

08:46.276 --> 08:48.195
[man 3] In the morning we ride.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.113
[man 4] Off to Xanadu!

08:50.197 --> 08:51.823
[all laughing]

09:18.725 --> 09:20.352
[wind whistling]

09:59.099 --> 10:01.601
Welcome to the royal hunting grounds.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.355
Let's get back to our roots.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.114
[indistinct cheering]

10:39.472 --> 10:41.433
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

10:43.100 --> 10:44.227
[Kublai chuckling]

10:45.145 --> 10:46.354
Yes.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.441
A horse of the wind, indeed.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.651
A hundred more are being delivered
as we speak, my Khan.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.236
-[exclaims]
-A thank you...

10:53.320 --> 10:55.405
for your great hospitality
towards your chieftains.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.824
[chuckles] I didn't know
you could finish a sentence

10:57.907 --> 11:00.327
without your western twin
breathing in your ear.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.411
[both chuckle]

11:01.494 --> 11:04.872
Gerel wouldn't miss a trip to Xanadu,
and he was eager to pay tribute.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.834
I'm certain there's good reason
for his delay.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.085
[Kublai] Hmm.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.591
[Kublai laughing]

11:15.758 --> 11:17.009
[crowd applauding]

11:17.093 --> 11:20.930
I accept this gift, Arban.
A fine surprise.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.641
[Kokachin] One day, my child will welcome
your grandson to Xanadu.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.935
Just as the Khan now welcomes you.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.691
[sighs]

11:33.401 --> 11:35.194
One day, my child will welcome
your grandson...

11:35.278 --> 11:38.155
No need for pageantry with me.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.991
[chuckles] Chulun is a close friend.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.744
He served as Kublai's General
for many years.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.872
-Sacrificed my looks for him.
-[laughs]

11:46.498 --> 11:47.499
May I?

11:51.503 --> 11:52.879
[Blue Princess] NergÃ¼i...

11:58.635 --> 11:59.719
[Chulun] Princess?

12:06.268 --> 12:07.560
Princess.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.358

[chatter ceases]

12:36.548 --> 12:39.342
[Chulun] My tribute, Great Khan.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.762
Procured from the distant edges
of your empire.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.223
[vocalizing]

13:07.870 --> 13:09.539
She's breathtaking.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.042
[chuckles]

13:13.125 --> 13:15.337
[singing in native tongue]

13:17.672 --> 13:18.881
[pats]

13:39.193 --> 13:41.446
[Shabkana] Destiny is strange, isn't it?

13:42.071 --> 13:45.450
Thousands of miles,
dissenting ambitions,

13:45.533 --> 13:48.995
and the pope does our work for us.

13:49.078 --> 13:52.999
A vote for Kublai is a vote
against his God and Savior.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.669
His Holiness has presented us
with an exceptional advantage...

13:56.753 --> 13:58.546
in changing Nayan's mind about him.

13:58.630 --> 14:02.091
Who says I've changed my mind about Nayan?
Or you?

14:02.174 --> 14:03.676
I believe that was your mother.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.639
Do you feel no shame
for what you've done to your sworn lord?

14:07.722 --> 14:10.642
Shame is for the weak
and the bored, Kaidu.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.854
Is this what it's come to?

14:14.937 --> 14:19.401
Making deals with gutless savages
of all and every kind?

14:19.484 --> 14:21.694
Losing my credibility, my power!

14:21.778 --> 14:23.405
You have no power to give.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.824
[Kaidu] And what power
does the Great Khan have?

14:26.908 --> 14:29.369
All of this is an illusion of power!

14:29.994 --> 14:32.914
Real power comes from being
true to one's self.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.166
Hmm.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.501
Sukh.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.963
Sukh came to us from the jungles of Burma.

14:41.047 --> 14:44.341
Greatly skilled
in the warrior art of Bando.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.802
Take my blade.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.182
Now...

14:51.265 --> 14:52.809
stab yourself.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.602
[Sukh] Where?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.063
Anywhere you like.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.819
[Sukh grunts]

15:07.782 --> 15:09.033
[grunts]

15:12.829 --> 15:13.996
Go see the healer.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.838
That is real power, Kaidu.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.174
And I can give it to you.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.599
[both exclaiming]

15:32.682 --> 15:34.225
[both laugh]

15:35.560 --> 15:36.811
[coughs]

15:38.563 --> 15:41.190
I didn't know being married
would change me.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.358
[exhales]

15:43.317 --> 15:45.987
Jingim, you've been married
four times since you were 17.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.530
This time it's different.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.158
Kokachin is different.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.829
She seems exceptional.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.957
Well, she is.
[chuckles]

15:58.040 --> 16:00.042
In every way, but...

16:01.753 --> 16:04.338
It's... it's not just that.

16:04.421 --> 16:05.757
[exhales]

16:06.924 --> 16:08.384
Something you cannot name.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.429
Yes.

16:12.514 --> 16:13.890
[chuckles]

16:16.058 --> 16:18.478
It's like looking up at the sky
and seeing only one...

16:18.561 --> 16:20.146
[horse neighing]

16:20.229 --> 16:21.313
Hey.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.401
[sighs]

16:27.069 --> 16:28.488
[laughs]

16:29.196 --> 16:32.283
[Jingim] This is what happens
when stable boys fall asleep.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.618
Hey.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.952
Whoa.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.829
-[horse whinnying]
-Easy now.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.252
Shh.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.674
How did you get away from home?

16:50.134 --> 16:51.385
Jingim.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.098
[horse whinnying]

16:59.936 --> 17:02.188
[indistinct laughing]

17:09.403 --> 17:10.780
[Kublai] Perhaps it was an accident.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.115
The horse ran through
the camelthorn weeds.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.367
There were no other marks on its body.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.288
It was a unique attack,
directed at a symbol of allegiance

17:19.371 --> 17:20.957
from an eminent chieftain.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.290
Or a child's prank.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.752
We invite these men into our royal home.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.378
If one of them turns out to be a traitor...

17:27.463 --> 17:29.215
Don't get overly excited, son.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.218
Look at all that you've done.
Bringing my chieftains together.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.680
Don't assume the worst.
It's only a horse.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.389
I've got 99 more.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.851
-And if it's Kaidu?
-Kaidu?

17:39.934 --> 17:42.895
Kaidu running around my paddock,
blinding horses?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.939
Someone call me so I can watch.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.691
[Kublai and Chulun laugh]

18:29.609 --> 18:30.818
Mother.
[chuckles nervously]

18:31.819 --> 18:34.196
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.328
Did you sleep out here?

18:43.497 --> 18:44.832
Something's happened.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.001
Something terrible.

18:47.084 --> 18:50.755
[sighs] Let's take you back,
have you bathed and changed.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.425
No, Mother.
I must tell you now.

18:55.259 --> 18:58.179
-I was wrong not to do so before.
-What, child?

18:59.847 --> 19:01.140
[sighs deeply]

19:03.225 --> 19:06.437
The Blue Princess.
The real one.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.605
The one that I told you before.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.024
Yes?

19:11.818 --> 19:13.277
She found me.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.447
She's here.

19:19.784 --> 19:23.746
-How can that be?
-I don't know, but she is.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.498
She wants it back.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.503
All of it.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.131
All of what?

19:36.258 --> 19:37.426
Her life.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.858
Our heir apparent decides
to grace us with her presence.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.234
Where's Father?

19:54.610 --> 19:55.820
Where is Father?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.280
What do you care?

20:00.825 --> 20:03.119
-He left.
-Orus.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.204
For Cambulac...

20:06.122 --> 20:07.623
with Grandmother.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.166
Why?

20:10.667 --> 20:11.836
To meet Ahmad.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.093
Where are you going?

20:20.302 --> 20:21.637
[shouting] Where are you going?

20:59.926 --> 21:01.886
What's inside these?

21:01.969 --> 21:04.305
Black powder.
Been loading them for weeks.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.223
Where are they headed?

21:06.307 --> 21:08.309
I just lift what and when I'm told to.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.561
[Kasar] Okay, let's go!

21:11.979 --> 21:14.231
Come on, hurry up!
Hurry up!

21:19.486 --> 21:22.406
Those barrels of black powder.
What's their destination?

21:22.489 --> 21:23.699
The capital.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.118
Back to work.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.955
What now?

21:29.038 --> 21:32.834
I saw wagons filled with those barrels
on a road that doesn't lead to Cambulac.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.796
And you know every road to Cambulac?

21:36.879 --> 21:38.714
It's my home.
Of course I do.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.383
This is not your concern.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.260
You should find out where they're headed.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.932
Get back to work.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.476
Now!

21:58.275 --> 22:00.486
Come on!
Move it!

22:39.108 --> 22:40.651
[drums playing]

23:17.438 --> 23:19.440
I saw you staring earlier.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.775
Everyone was staring.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.570
And you wish to be just like everyone?

23:43.130 --> 23:44.715
They're Thessalians.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.384
Like Alexander's horse.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.845
Bucephalus.

23:52.514 --> 23:55.476
They are born one color
and gradually change coats.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.104
By the time they're four or five,

23:58.187 --> 24:00.814
the mares can barely
recognize their offspring.

24:02.483 --> 24:06.820
-How do you know all of that?
-I consider myself a student.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.198
-Of horses?
-Of all of it.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.868
I've been traveling the world
since I was 16.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.621
Mmm-hmm, as have I.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.332
Come to think of it, perhaps I was 15.

24:20.501 --> 24:24.213
One day, I will go to your lands
and I will dance as a European.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.259
[laughs] They will love you.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.511
Would I love Venice?

24:30.594 --> 24:33.305
It is magnificent.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.474
The City of Bridges.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.393
Instead of roads, we travel on canals.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.728
In wooden boats.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.147
That's absurd.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.399
You wouldn't think that if you saw it.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.318
If it is so magnificent...

24:46.402 --> 24:48.862
why are you here and not there?

24:50.489 --> 24:52.366
You must have summoned me.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.576
I did no such thing.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.166
I'm afraid.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.502
-Don't be.
-[chuckles]

25:04.711 --> 25:06.838
I'm afraid you will fall in love with me.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.177
All men fall in love with me
because I always leave.

25:12.636 --> 25:16.557
And there's nothing men love more
than the thing they cannot have.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.812
Understood?

25:32.364 --> 25:33.990
What's your hurry?

25:35.284 --> 25:37.119
The sun will rise.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.169
Ah.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.052
[Marco grunts]

25:54.136 --> 25:55.429
[chuckles]

26:37.804 --> 26:38.805
There.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.974
Now, you'll never know the time of day.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.309
[laughs softly]

27:11.129 --> 27:13.299
[both moan softly]

27:36.154 --> 27:37.989
[praying indistinctly]

27:44.788 --> 27:46.707
[footsteps approaching]

27:59.428 --> 28:01.222
That's a lovely necklace.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.772
I have one, too.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.316
Want to see?

28:22.033 --> 28:23.785
It's beautiful.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.706
You're a prince.
I've met you.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.710
You wore a pale green dress.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.921
With a peacock feather on the sash.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.637
Don't be sad.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.681
[Ahmad] Ling Ling.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.687
-I found the prince.
-[Ahmad] Yes, well done. Well done.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.065
Will you give us a moment alone?

28:55.692 --> 28:56.693
Thank you.

28:58.445 --> 28:59.446
[sighs]

29:02.115 --> 29:03.116
[Ling Ling chuckles]

29:04.576 --> 29:07.371
Like many, that little girl
never had a chance.

29:09.205 --> 29:11.875
Her mother, a concubine.
Her father's dead.

29:13.043 --> 29:17.339
[sighs] Abused by her family,
ripped from her home by the Khan.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.050
He bound her feet.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.512
-What?
-The Khan.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.724
To make a mockery of the Chinese,
he bound her feet.

29:29.351 --> 29:32.563
If you look at her ankles
just close enough, you can see the marks.

29:35.441 --> 29:36.608
You sent her to me.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.820
What reason would I have to do that?

29:39.903 --> 29:41.363
Because you know of my sin.

29:42.573 --> 29:43.699
Your sin?

29:47.328 --> 29:49.288
She's mine to give.

29:49.371 --> 29:53.584
Her mother is one of my subjects...
desperate to get her away from this place.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.251
[Ling Ling chuckles]

29:56.962 --> 29:58.630
The Khan has been cruel to her?

29:58.714 --> 29:59.756
Oh, yes.

30:01.007 --> 30:02.133
Very.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.729
[latch opens]

30:34.249 --> 30:36.292
Is she on the way to Xanadu?

30:43.342 --> 30:46.428
Chabi cannot know
that Ling Ling is missing...

30:46.512 --> 30:48.263
until after the Kurultai.

30:50.391 --> 30:52.267
So it's done?

30:52.351 --> 30:53.560
Almost.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.565
The Christian prince
needs one final nudge.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.405
The kind only a mother could provide.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.893
Should have known.

31:36.978 --> 31:39.981
Running back to daddy
before blood is spilled?

31:41.107 --> 31:43.193
Pretend you never saw me.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.404
Might be the smartest thing you ever did.

31:47.155 --> 31:51.618
When you were handed command of a tumen
based on the merit of nothing...

31:53.161 --> 31:56.623
you were aware of what happens
to deserters, yes?

31:57.791 --> 31:59.292
Death.

31:59.375 --> 32:04.089
And to that coward's brave brothers...
guilty of nothing but proximity?

32:05.090 --> 32:06.091
Death.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.554
I'm going to follow those barrels.

32:10.637 --> 32:13.849
Get back to your gravel patch.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.476
Slumber well...

32:15.559 --> 32:19.480
knowing you are going
to be whipped tomorrow at my command.

32:19.563 --> 32:23.734
What can I say to make you turn around
and walk away?

32:29.573 --> 32:31.032
[sighs]

32:31.116 --> 32:32.200
[inhales sharply]

32:32.283 --> 32:33.409
[grunting]

32:38.123 --> 32:39.332
[groans]

32:39.415 --> 32:43.754
Tell them I did this to you.
They may just pardon you.

32:43.837 --> 32:44.921
[grunts]

32:47.132 --> 32:48.717
[groans]

32:48.800 --> 32:50.176
[horse neighs]

33:18.497 --> 33:19.790
[water bubbling]

33:31.009 --> 33:32.719
[gasping]

33:34.220 --> 33:37.516
-[Blue Princess] You told her.
-[panting] What?

33:40.644 --> 33:42.437
About me.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.397
[inhales deeply] I didn't!

33:44.480 --> 33:45.732
[continues panting]

33:45.816 --> 33:47.901
Do you think I'm a fool, NergÃ¼i?

33:48.860 --> 33:52.030
There's nothing you can do
that I don't know.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.199
[softly] I'm sorry.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.408
[voice breaking] I'm sorry.

33:55.491 --> 33:57.368
The empress is not on our side.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.038
She is. I swear.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.332
She's my mother now.

34:10.172 --> 34:11.550
Your mother?

34:14.553 --> 34:16.304
-[gasps]
-Your mother's dead.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.556
[trembling]

34:17.639 --> 34:21.101
She was killed by Kublai and Chabi's army
when they took you.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.522
She is my friend.

34:26.607 --> 34:30.068
Was she your friend when she made you
lay under the stable boy?

34:36.032 --> 34:40.286
You've only ever had
one friend in this court.

34:48.712 --> 34:50.714
[Marco sighs]

34:56.928 --> 34:58.054
[knocking on door]

34:59.097 --> 35:00.641
[man] Master Marco!

35:01.725 --> 35:03.101
[both sigh]

35:04.394 --> 35:07.313
Couldn't block the light for you forever.

35:07.397 --> 35:09.565
-[knocking continues]
-[man] Master Marco!

35:10.776 --> 35:11.902
[sighs]

35:19.200 --> 35:22.203
-[horse whinnying]
-Easy now... easy now.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.122
It's going to be all right.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.418
Only two men keeping watch.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.921
Heads up each other's asses.
Get rid of them.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.631
[Marco] Yes, Great Khan.

35:33.799 --> 35:34.925
[muttering indistinctly]

35:35.842 --> 35:37.803
[Marco sighs]

35:37.886 --> 35:39.554
If not Kaidu, then who?

35:39.638 --> 35:42.432
-[horse neighing]
-[Jingim] Shh.

35:43.016 --> 35:44.768
He's been brave long enough.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.279
-[horse neighs]
-[sword slicing]

35:59.407 --> 36:02.953
[Chulun] There are people
under this very roof who despise you.

36:03.036 --> 36:06.957
Would rather you dead
than be forced to bow to you as Khan.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.333
[women moaning]

36:08.416 --> 36:10.585
Why should I care? Hmm?

36:11.377 --> 36:12.587
You're afraid, Kublai.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.549
Afraid, because you can't
steal it this time.

36:17.926 --> 36:20.636
You have to win, fair and square.

36:21.554 --> 36:24.515
I've devoted my life to them.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.601
And it's never enough.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.855
Because, for them...

36:30.521 --> 36:33.692
eating themselves sick,
fucking themselves raw,

36:33.775 --> 36:36.778
that's the most they could ever aspire to.

36:36.862 --> 36:37.863
[indistinct moaning]

36:37.946 --> 36:41.783
Words like "expansion"
and "empire" mean nothing.

36:41.867 --> 36:45.370
They need to see the future.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.080
Feel it.

36:47.163 --> 36:49.499
Hold it in their hands.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.584
[Kublai grunts]

36:54.212 --> 36:56.256
My family requires your help.

36:56.339 --> 37:00.301
I'm not in Cambulac of my own will.
I'm a prisoner of the Khan's.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.346
A vile animal who ruts atop me
as he pleases.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.974
If my daughter is kept here...

37:06.933 --> 37:08.935
he will one day
do the same to her.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.687
Turn her into a whore.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.900
You were a much-revered courtesan.

37:16.567 --> 37:21.740
I began in the streets of Wuhan...
as a girl no more than seven or eight.

37:21.823 --> 37:22.866
Please.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.286
The men were all different.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.329
Some were sadistic...

37:28.413 --> 37:30.456
would force me onto my knees.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.126
Call me names, make me beg for mercy.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.628
-[sighs]
-Others cried the entire time.

37:36.797 --> 37:39.758
Called me by their daughters'
or their wives' names.

37:41.176 --> 37:45.764
But there is one man...
I always remember best.

37:47.348 --> 37:50.811
He'd tuck me into bed before leaving...

37:50.894 --> 37:52.896
sing to me...

37:52.979 --> 37:55.148
kiss my eyelids to sleep.

38:04.074 --> 38:05.741
How will you treat my daughter?

38:05.826 --> 38:09.830
Like an angel.
She will want for nothing.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.498
And she will be safe?

38:13.416 --> 38:16.086
I control the most revered army
in all this land.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.629
She'll be protected and feared.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.341
And where is this heaven?

38:21.424 --> 38:25.220
North of here. In the lush valley
where the twin rivers meet.

38:27.180 --> 38:31.059
I hope... you will visit us one day.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.772
I intend to.

38:44.990 --> 38:48.409
[Shabkana] This is what comes
of an empress absent royal blood.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.456
Garish displays of opulence...

38:55.583 --> 38:58.586
more befitting concubine than queen.

39:01.672 --> 39:05.510
We have a chance
to restore honor to the empire.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.805
My head is heavy
with the weight of this decision.

39:13.101 --> 39:18.564
When Kublai's mother, Sorkaktani,
stole the Khanate from our house...

39:18.648 --> 39:23.862
anyone who sided with us was decimated
in the cruelest of fashions.

39:24.529 --> 39:28.824
A wicked bunch they were.
A wicked bunch they are.

39:31.119 --> 39:35.040
Sorkaktani demanded that my sister,
Oghul Qaimish...

39:36.249 --> 39:38.960
pledge her fealty to the House of Tolui.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.255
She would not.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.591
So they stripped her
and bathed her in boiling oil...

39:46.717 --> 39:48.844
before knifing her skin loose...

39:49.762 --> 39:52.807
and peeling it like hide from her bones.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.854
But still... she lived.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.901
And still she would not deny our house...

40:02.984 --> 40:05.987
or our claim to the throne.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.573
So Sorkaktani took her to a river...

40:09.950 --> 40:12.618
rolled her in a weighted carpet...

40:12.702 --> 40:16.122
and as they prepared to toss her in,
I screamed...

40:16.206 --> 40:18.708
"Long live Sorkaktani.

40:18.791 --> 40:23.004
Long live her many heirs.
Long live the House of Tolui."

40:27.133 --> 40:28.801
They threw her in anyway.

40:30.511 --> 40:34.057
She sank and I stood there watching...

40:34.140 --> 40:37.352
until her final breath
bubbled to the surface.

40:39.187 --> 40:42.773
Those were the final words
she heard in this life.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.612
And it has haunted me.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.538
Wake up.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.751
The decision has already been made.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.621
[sighs]

41:38.704 --> 41:40.248
Orus, you half-wit.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.832
Put down your knife.

41:45.295 --> 41:47.713
-Or what?
-We're going home.

41:50.925 --> 41:52.385
[both grunting]

41:54.554 --> 41:56.472
[grunts and pants]

41:57.557 --> 41:58.849
[grunts]

42:03.229 --> 42:04.355
[growls]

42:20.871 --> 42:22.582
You wanted to be a hunter, you hunted.

42:22.665 --> 42:25.043
You wanted to be a wrestler, you wrestled!

42:25.126 --> 42:26.252
[grunting]

42:27.545 --> 42:29.047
-[groans]
-You wanted to be a warrior...

42:29.130 --> 42:30.590
you fought!

42:30.673 --> 42:32.300
Yeah, well...

42:32.383 --> 42:33.593
[both grunting]

42:37.347 --> 42:40.058
-I didn't want to be the Khan.
-[groans]

42:40.141 --> 42:42.685
Well, I did.
It's all I ever wanted.

42:43.519 --> 42:45.230
[both grunt]

42:45.313 --> 42:48.191
[panting] It's the way it should be.

42:52.278 --> 42:53.654
[straining]

42:57.408 --> 42:58.993
[mutters]

42:59.077 --> 43:00.203
[both panting]

43:13.007 --> 43:17.011
I know you want to go home, Orus,
but he needs us by his side.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.474
[breathing heavily] When has Grandmother
ever done right by our father?

43:23.809 --> 43:25.395
Now Ahmad?

43:25.478 --> 43:29.064
If this is the way it is,
whatever it is, Orus,

43:29.149 --> 43:31.276
we have to be there for him.

43:36.906 --> 43:38.699
[Orus sighs]

43:38.783 --> 43:39.867
[Khutulun coughs]

43:58.761 --> 44:01.514
[all chanting in Mongolian]

44:12.733 --> 44:15.820
We have grown too accustomed
to amazing things.

44:16.696 --> 44:20.283
We, whose feet lost form
from walking the steppe,

44:20.366 --> 44:24.995
whose noses grew flat
from punishing winds.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.540
We now have more food
than our stomachs need.

44:27.623 --> 44:28.666
[all laugh]

44:28.749 --> 44:31.752
More warmth than our skin can bear.

44:31.836 --> 44:35.298
And so if you ask,
"Why, then? Why do we need more?"

44:35.381 --> 44:40.220
I will tell you...
because that is what comes next.

44:41.679 --> 44:46.767
Temujin crawled from the wolf's womb
and conquered the Merkit people.

44:46.851 --> 44:52.106
He united our tribesmen and, as a nation,
they took North China.

44:52.189 --> 44:57.487
He birthed robust sons...
and those sons sired sons,

44:57.570 --> 45:00.030
and together they sacked the Ilkhan,

45:00.114 --> 45:04.410
Persia, Hungary...
and the Caspian Sea.

45:04.494 --> 45:06.912
And we are still not done.

45:06.996 --> 45:09.249
More Mongolia.

45:10.458 --> 45:11.917
That is my gift to you.

45:13.168 --> 45:17.548
One day, each of you will see
our nation at its fullest.

45:19.925 --> 45:25.431
Until then... I present a small notion
of what our world has to offer.

45:28.518 --> 45:29.894
[crowd exclaiming]

45:41.781 --> 45:43.449
[indistinct]

45:44.992 --> 45:46.369
[laughing]

45:47.995 --> 45:49.830
[laughing]

45:54.335 --> 45:55.920
[crowd cheering faintly]

45:58.423 --> 46:00.425
[fireworks popping]

46:44.719 --> 46:46.095
[gasps]

46:46.178 --> 46:47.221
[panting]

46:48.138 --> 46:49.390
What are you doing here?

46:51.392 --> 46:53.143
[trembling] I need you.

46:54.687 --> 46:56.271
You're my only friend.

46:59.525 --> 47:01.110
[sniffling]

47:01.193 --> 47:02.737
What's wrong?

47:06.366 --> 47:08.659
She wants my life.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.036
My child. My husband.

47:13.414 --> 47:14.915
I cannot give it to her.

47:14.999 --> 47:17.668
But she'll tell them I'm a peasant.

47:17.752 --> 47:21.964
And the baby, she'll say about him
and his poor wife...

47:22.047 --> 47:23.841
Wife? What baby?

47:23.924 --> 47:27.011
No father for them because of me.

47:27.094 --> 47:29.597
Because I wanted to survive.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.433
[breathing heavily]

47:32.517 --> 47:34.852
[sighs] I leave tonight.

47:34.935 --> 47:37.855
I came to say goodbye
to my one true friend.

47:37.938 --> 47:40.274
You can't leave.
They'll find you.

47:40.357 --> 47:43.528
-They'll send the army after you.
-No. No, they won't. They cannot.

47:44.404 --> 47:47.490
The Blue Princess
blinded the Khan's best horses.

47:49.199 --> 47:50.910
Who blinded the horses?

47:51.702 --> 47:53.203
The Blue Princess.

47:57.667 --> 47:58.709
Who?

48:00.085 --> 48:01.796
The Blue Princess.

48:11.556 --> 48:12.557
[gasps]

48:17.102 --> 48:18.813
[shudders]

48:32.493 --> 48:33.994
[cries]

48:36.246 --> 48:37.873
[Kublai laughs]

48:38.791 --> 48:40.125
[inaudible]

49:04.108 --> 49:05.610
[moans]

49:06.569 --> 49:08.738
You were correct to bring her to me.

49:10.322 --> 49:11.574
You will make her well?

49:11.657 --> 49:13.242
[softly] Of course.

49:14.159 --> 49:17.788
She seemed quite... mad.

49:17.872 --> 49:21.458
Her mind is... temporarily unsound.

49:22.627 --> 49:27.214
Only a mother can understand
what she suffers for her future child.

49:31.260 --> 49:33.929
-Marco.
-Yes, Empress?

49:38.976 --> 49:42.271
You have done what few before
have ever managed of me.

49:43.939 --> 49:44.940
What's that?

49:46.400 --> 49:48.318
You've changed my opinion of you.

49:51.196 --> 49:53.448
It would be best, for her sake...

49:54.491 --> 49:56.619
to act as if this never happened.

49:59.789 --> 50:02.750
-And the horses?
-I will see to my husband.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.549
[sighs deeply]

50:11.216 --> 50:13.010
[fireworks popping faintly]

50:27.983 --> 50:29.819
A gesture of good faith.

50:29.902 --> 50:31.654
You need me.

50:32.446 --> 50:33.530
[Nayan] What?

50:34.239 --> 50:37.785
This time, I will hear you say it.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.244
Hmm.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.124
I need you, Kaidu.

50:45.292 --> 50:47.795
[sighs] It will take more
than just your votes.

50:48.838 --> 50:52.592
If we take the Kurultai,
Kublai will come at us to take it back.

50:54.635 --> 50:56.553
We will need your army.

50:56.637 --> 50:58.639
[Ahmad]
There are ways to break the Khan...

50:59.389 --> 51:00.850
between now and then.

51:02.602 --> 51:04.436
Ways to weaken his credibility...

51:05.187 --> 51:09.441
and ensure that our dear Nayan's armies
are never called upon.

51:15.405 --> 51:17.449
You leave all of that to me.

51:19.785 --> 51:22.830
[inhales deeply]

51:22.913 --> 51:26.541
And the Lord said,
"I will fill with drunkenness,

51:26.626 --> 51:28.210
all who live in this land.

51:28.293 --> 51:33.382
I will smash them one against the other,
parents and children alike.

51:33.465 --> 51:39.263
I'll allow no pity or mercy or compassion
to keep me from destroying them."

52:47.206 --> 52:49.374
You never cease to impress me.

52:50.835 --> 52:52.377
And I never will.

53:15.400 --> 53:18.237
[Khutulun] What happened in there?
What did you do?

53:18.320 --> 53:21.490
Watch your tongue.
She's your elder.

53:29.749 --> 53:31.166
What did you do?

53:34.086 --> 53:35.129
[gasps]

53:38.841 --> 53:41.551
I am the future Khan of Mongolia.

53:42.469 --> 53:45.514
Do not question me... ever again.

54:08.913 --> 54:10.080
[sighs]

54:14.960 --> 54:16.670
[exhaling deeply]

54:28.723 --> 54:30.559
[faint rustling]

54:51.496 --> 54:53.498
[solemn music playing]
