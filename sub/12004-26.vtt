00:02.174 --> 00:04.966
- I like your stuff, but the boys need proof.
- Okay.

00:04.997 --> 00:07.089
So you're gonna do a solo piece.
Somewhere hot.

00:07.107 --> 00:09.174
Apparently, there was an incident
at the car wash last night.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.043
I have to head in.
Would you look at that?

00:12.112 --> 00:13.112
Good evening, ladies.

00:13.146 --> 00:14.880
Which baby are we
visiting tonight?

00:14.915 --> 00:16.148
Craig, it's Kathryn.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.950
I think I might have
figured out

00:17.984 --> 00:20.085
who Angelo's source
at the hospital is.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.820

00:26.059 --> 00:27.560
Hi.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.562
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, of course.

00:29.596 --> 00:33.666
I've tried really hard to be
okay with Angelo moving in,

00:33.700 --> 00:34.667
but I'm not.

Good morning.

00:48.281 --> 00:51.317
Uh, my mom's at physical
therapy this morning.

00:51.351 --> 00:53.018
Oh, I'm not looking for her.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.253
I want to give this to you.

00:54.287 --> 00:56.855
I carved the letters myself.

00:59.025 --> 00:59.959
Oh.

01:02.862 --> 01:05.030
Wow. Thanks.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.738
Oh, it doesn't take much water.

01:12.772 --> 01:13.939
Should be easy to take care of.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.643
It's great.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.745
Um, I have to go.

01:19.779 --> 01:22.681
Of course.
Um...

01:22.716 --> 01:24.283
Now that I'm living here,

01:24.317 --> 01:26.552
I hope we can spend
some time together.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.320
Get to know each other again.

01:28.355 --> 01:31.290
Yeah.

01:31.324 --> 01:33.258
I really do have to go.

- <i>( Rock music playing )</i>
<i>- ♪ Oh oh oh</i>

01:41.868 --> 01:44.169
this is the ultimate irony
that dad is sponsoring

01:44.204 --> 01:46.972
- a motorcycle show.
- I don't think that he hates motorcycles.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.173
I think he just
hates us on them.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.776
Well, it's good
for business, so...

01:50.810 --> 01:52.077
Well, I for one
cannot wait to see

01:52.112 --> 01:54.613
50 hogs and the biker
chicks who love them

01:54.648 --> 01:55.981
- all around dad.
- ( Both laughing )

01:56.016 --> 01:58.684
- He's gonna be so freaked out.
- John: <i>Son of a bitch!</i>

02:01.855 --> 02:03.522
- Yikes.
- Damn.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.424
Can you believe it?

02:05.458 --> 02:06.725
They came back.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.360
- Who's they?
- The people that did this before.

02:09.395 --> 02:12.231
How do you know
it's the same people?

02:12.265 --> 02:15.034
Obviously, they were mad that
we painted over the first one.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.036
But you must see
the difference between

02:17.070 --> 02:18.971
the girl that was
painted here yesterday and

02:19.005 --> 02:20.172
<i>this.</i>

02:20.206 --> 02:22.107
Uh... no.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.777
You're honestly telling me

02:24.811 --> 02:26.045
that you don't see
the difference between

02:26.079 --> 02:27.212
a figurative drawing and a tag?

02:27.247 --> 02:29.014
- It's all just...
- It's all just graffiti.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.949
Which is not a bad word, dad!

02:30.984 --> 02:33.886
If it's done without
my consent, it's a crime.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.088
I refuse to believe that you can't
see the difference between the two.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.990
It's all the same continuum.
Yeah, I'll give you that.

02:38.024 --> 02:39.825
- It's all art...
- Art?! Are you serious?

02:39.859 --> 02:40.893
You're calling this art?

02:40.927 --> 02:42.661
Obviously not in
the traditional sense

02:42.696 --> 02:43.829
- of the word.
- In what sense of the word

02:43.863 --> 02:45.030
would it be art?
Come on!

02:45.065 --> 02:46.799
This is no better than
breaking and entering.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.033
It's the same as
breaking and entering,

02:48.068 --> 02:49.668
really? It's the
same thing?

02:49.703 --> 02:51.904
It is gangbangers
destroying private property.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.639
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.774
I worked very hard
to own this wall.

02:55.809 --> 02:59.411
If want someone to paint it,
I will ask them to do so.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.548
Dad, it is people who
are otherwise invisible

03:02.582 --> 03:05.384
expressing themselves, communicating
in the only way they know how.

03:05.418 --> 03:07.186
They're taking a spray can.
They're saying,

03:07.220 --> 03:08.420
"here I am!
This is me!

03:08.455 --> 03:10.122
- See me."
- Are you kidding me?!

03:10.156 --> 03:12.191
That is the stupidest thing I have
ever heard in my entire life.

03:12.225 --> 03:15.094
I will paint over this
again and again and again.

03:15.128 --> 03:18.263
Day in, day out. I
will not let them win.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.150
Angelo, can you
come down from there?

03:38.184 --> 03:39.785
I'd like to talk with you.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.920
Mm-hmm.
And, uh, I also

03:41.955 --> 03:43.989
noticed that your back door
is not shutting that well,

03:44.023 --> 03:46.759
so I can sand that
down when I'm done.

03:46.793 --> 03:49.695
Our lawyer's investigator
just talked to leanne.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.764
Who?

03:51.798 --> 03:52.998
<i>Leanne crowley,</i>

03:53.032 --> 03:56.935
the nurse from the hospital
who told you about brizia.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.671
And what else did she tell you?

03:59.706 --> 04:01.774
Well, I saw pictures
of the two of you

04:01.808 --> 04:04.843
having breakfast
together in robes.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.045
<i>So I think I could</i>
<i>put two and two together.</i>

04:08.882 --> 04:11.116
How did you find out about her?

04:11.151 --> 04:13.852
Why is she a secret?

04:13.887 --> 04:16.021
She's not.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.690
Angelo, will you please
turn around and talk with me?

04:21.161 --> 04:25.063
We asked you multiple times
who told you about brizia.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.800
And you've consistently
said you didn't know.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.967
<i>I went to the hospital.</i>

04:29.002 --> 04:31.136
I passed out my number
and said if anyone

04:31.171 --> 04:33.138
knew anything
to please call me.

04:33.173 --> 04:36.074
- Leanne saw me...
- And she wanted to meet you.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.744
( Sighs ) She was
friends with brizia,

04:38.778 --> 04:40.712
who was there
working that night.

04:40.747 --> 04:44.716
So leanne asked if she could
contact me on her behalf.

04:44.751 --> 04:45.884
But that's it.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.754
Why didn't you tell us
about this before?

04:48.788 --> 04:50.823
( Chuckles ) I didn't
think it was important.

04:50.857 --> 04:54.026
- ( Scoffs )
- Okay, I didn't want Gina to know.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.994
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.830
But that's the truth.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.640
Yo.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.642
Hey.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.845
You didn't by chance, uh, tag

05:12.879 --> 05:14.980
the wall that I bombed
the other day at the car wash?

05:15.014 --> 05:17.783
Oh yeah. They painted
over it. Screw 'em.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.018
- Is this your car?
- Yeah. Uh...

05:20.053 --> 05:21.787
You know what? Maybe we
shouldn't do that. You know,

05:21.821 --> 05:23.755
retaliate, especially
at that place.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.990
Why not?

05:25.024 --> 05:26.758
God, I love this thing.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.660
It's just that obviously
they don't get it,

05:28.695 --> 05:30.095
so I don't see why
we force the issue.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.997
I've seen it parked
around town.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.098
Really? You have?

05:33.132 --> 05:35.000
Dude, every time I saw
this thing I said,

05:35.034 --> 05:37.769
"man, I wanna bomb it!"

05:37.804 --> 05:39.671
Yeah, I think about
that all the time.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.673
I first, of course, thought
I'd do something with...

05:41.708 --> 05:43.108
- some sky? Right?
- Yeah! No, totally.

05:43.142 --> 05:44.977
- First thing I thought.
- Yeah, you could have some awesome

05:45.011 --> 05:46.945
storm clouds rolling
over the horizon right there.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.780
Yeah, like
"here comes trouble."

05:48.815 --> 05:49.815
Or something from the ocean.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.750
A big great white.
Turn the grill

05:51.784 --> 05:53.151
into jaws.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.087
- That's so freakin' cool.
- I know. Let's do it!

05:55.121 --> 05:56.889
- We are doing it!
- Both: Yeah!

05:56.923 --> 05:59.057
You know how passionate
Bay is about her art.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.627
Art? It's not art,
Kathryn. Come on.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.061
It's scribbling with
a spray can.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.031
It's, I don't know,
painting a mustache

06:06.065 --> 06:07.599
on the "Mona Lisa."

06:07.634 --> 06:09.534
Your car wash is
the "Mona Lisa"?

06:09.569 --> 06:12.738
You know what kills me?
I was mostly upset for her.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.840
I didn't want the graffiti
making the place look dumpy

06:14.874 --> 06:16.408
<i>for the motorcycle show</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

06:16.442 --> 06:17.476
A show, I might add,

06:17.510 --> 06:20.279
I only agreed to sponsor
because Bay asked me to.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.481
Well, that's when she was with Emmett.
Now she's not.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.516
Well then, why didn't she ask
me to cancel the damn thing?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.386
Because she's a teenage girl.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.521
It's easier for her to
yell at us about one thing

06:29.555 --> 06:31.123
when she's upset
about the other.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.157
Will you please stop
eating the cheese?

06:32.191 --> 06:33.392
I need it for a
casserole, honey.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.260
All right.

06:35.295 --> 06:38.063
She just took it so personally.

06:38.097 --> 06:41.934
I used to have fights like that all
the time with my dad when I was 16.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.970
"How can you believe in the death penalty?
You are a fascist!"

06:45.004 --> 06:47.706
I guess so.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.641
I'm gonna go work
this off in the gym.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.519
Emmett bledsoe.

07:00.553 --> 07:03.689
All right.
Here's your badge,

07:03.723 --> 07:06.358
your calendar

07:06.392 --> 07:09.127

07:19.172 --> 07:20.272
Yup.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.626
Sorry, just one...

07:41.661 --> 07:43.695
ah! Yes!

07:43.730 --> 07:45.297
( Exhales )

07:45.331 --> 07:46.498
Finally cleared
the lake of fire.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.501
Nice to see all those
hours of practice paying off.

07:49.535 --> 07:54.206
What can I say?
Buckner hall dedication.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.174
How is school?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.275
Uh...

07:57.310 --> 07:59.878
You mind if we just
get right to it?

07:59.912 --> 08:03.015
'Cause, uh, I got a bunch
of worlds to discover here.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.716
There's nothing to get to.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.685
I just noticed that
since wilke left

08:06.719 --> 08:07.953
you haven't been playing
too much music,

08:07.987 --> 08:09.688
and I saw that there's
gonna be a stage

08:09.722 --> 08:11.523
and a p.A. At dad's
motorcycle show tomorrow,

08:11.557 --> 08:12.657
- so I thought that maybe you could...
- Okay.

08:12.692 --> 08:13.625
Pause.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.760
First of all,

08:14.794 --> 08:16.428
I have been playing
a lot of music

08:16.462 --> 08:17.496
in my studio.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.598
- I know. That's what...
- And second,

08:19.632 --> 08:21.299
putting me in front of a
whole bunch of biker dudes

08:21.334 --> 08:24.102
who don't want to hear my
stuff is bad on all levels.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.338
Why? You are
so good, honey.

08:26.372 --> 08:28.273
Come on, mom. Don't you
remember altamont?

08:29.275 --> 08:32.077
Trust me, bad idea.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.278
Okay, fine.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.913
I won't push.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.950
But sometimes when
you get into a slump

08:38.985 --> 08:41.153
it's best to just
get back out there.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.755
Mom, I'm not in a slump!

08:43.789 --> 08:45.590
Really, I played
a bunch of gigs,

08:45.625 --> 08:46.958
and it's always the same thing.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.628
It never goes anywhere,
so now I'm just

08:49.662 --> 08:51.596
playing for myself.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.665
And I'm awesome.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.267
<i>( Buzzing and zapping</i>

Just... come on!

11:03.814 --> 11:06.047
It smells fantastic.
What is it?

11:07.564 --> 11:09.157
It's a vegan chocolate cake.

11:09.855 --> 11:10.888
I'm experimenting.

11:12.054 --> 11:14.145
You know, there's this
little bistro on east 11th

11:14.169 --> 11:15.889
that makes the best
<i>pot du chocolat.</i>

11:16.528 --> 11:17.247
You would love it.

11:17.896 --> 11:18.863
We should go sometime.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.700
I don't think so.

11:22.734 --> 11:24.401
It doesn't have to be a bistro.

11:24.436 --> 11:26.470
We can go somewhere else.

11:29.574 --> 11:32.376
Look, I'm really happy
that you're here

11:32.410 --> 11:34.545
for Bay and my mom...

11:34.579 --> 11:37.181
But we don't have
to be friends.

11:38.316 --> 11:39.383
What if I want to?

11:39.417 --> 11:41.318
I'm not sure I want to.

11:44.189 --> 11:47.691
It's funny, I thought
it was Adrianna

11:47.726 --> 11:49.727
that didn't want me
to live in the guesthouse.

11:49.761 --> 11:51.562
She wasn't too excited
about it either.

11:53.031 --> 11:54.598
I got it.

11:54.633 --> 11:56.567
I'll try to stay
out of your way.

12:01.740 --> 12:02.740
<i>( Door knocks )</i>

12:02.774 --> 12:03.707
Come in.

12:04.776 --> 12:06.544
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:06.578 --> 12:09.580
I noticed that Angelo's been
eating breakfast over here a lot.

12:09.614 --> 12:11.515
And does...

12:11.550 --> 12:13.484
He not feel welcome
over at our place?

12:13.518 --> 12:15.319
He's trying to make
strides with Daphne,

12:15.353 --> 12:17.354
and we are married,
so what's a little

12:17.389 --> 12:19.223
burnt toast between newlyweds?

12:19.257 --> 12:21.926
But only on paper, right?
I mean,

12:21.960 --> 12:23.961
your marriage?

12:23.995 --> 12:26.130
Of course.
I'm just kidding.

12:26.164 --> 12:27.698
What are you getting at?

12:27.766 --> 12:28.933
Well, I haven't seen
Patrick around here.

12:28.967 --> 12:30.000
And I wasn't sure if you...

12:30.035 --> 12:31.869
Kathryn, I'm gonna
be late for work.

12:34.806 --> 12:35.839
Do you remember those pictures

12:35.874 --> 12:37.641
we found in Angelo's storage

12:37.676 --> 12:38.909
of him and that blonde woman?

12:40.812 --> 12:41.745
Yes.

12:41.780 --> 12:43.447
Turns out that she's the one

12:43.481 --> 12:45.516
who told Angelo about brizia.

12:45.550 --> 12:48.185
Wait, I don't understand.
They met because of the case?

12:48.219 --> 12:50.187
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>I put it together, but</i>

12:50.221 --> 12:51.388
she's a nurse at the
children's hospital.

12:51.423 --> 12:53.223
The one that spoke
to us the other day.

12:53.258 --> 12:55.993
<i>He says he went</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

12:56.027 --> 12:57.328
He was asking around
and they met

12:57.362 --> 12:58.295
and they...

13:00.031 --> 13:01.799
<i>Look, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I just didn't want</i>

13:01.833 --> 13:03.767
you to be surprised if she
showed up at our trial.

13:03.802 --> 13:04.902
It's fine.

13:04.936 --> 13:07.638
Thank you for telling me.

13:07.672 --> 13:08.906
You know, when we
were together,

13:08.940 --> 13:10.608
it was like dating a celebrity.

13:10.642 --> 13:14.445
Women would just stare at him, even
though I was standing right there.

13:14.479 --> 13:17.481
- But he chose you.
- Yeah, that's what he would say.

13:17.515 --> 13:19.750
But it didn't stop me from worrying
if the next woman who hit on him

13:19.784 --> 13:22.353
would be the one
he'd want more.

13:22.387 --> 13:25.189
( Exhales deeply ) Thank God
this marriage is just on paper

13:25.223 --> 13:26.624
'cause it would be hell
to live like that again.

13:26.658 --> 13:28.559
Besides, there's Patrick.

13:30.428 --> 13:32.363
Exactly.

13:32.397 --> 13:34.667
Thank you.
I gotta go.

13:38.503 --> 13:42.039
Wait, so you know that Emmett's
coming to this thing, right?

13:42.073 --> 13:45.142
The pictures above his bed
are of motorcycles.

13:45.176 --> 13:47.911
I figured he'd be there.

13:47.946 --> 13:49.813
I think he's going
for another reason.

13:51.016 --> 13:52.816
I don't know what to say.

13:52.851 --> 13:55.653
I made myself pretty clear.

13:56.888 --> 13:58.555
You did?

13:58.590 --> 13:59.923
He never said anything.

13:59.958 --> 14:01.659
Well, I did.

14:01.693 --> 14:03.594
What did you say?

14:03.628 --> 14:06.463
I said I was mad.

14:06.498 --> 14:07.665
What do you think that I said?

14:09.601 --> 14:12.302
He has the impression
that he can get you back.

14:12.337 --> 14:14.405
- He's waiting for you.
- Why do you care?

14:15.540 --> 14:17.207
- Are you guys toge...
- No no!

14:17.242 --> 14:18.409
Why do you always think that?

14:18.443 --> 14:20.177
Look,

14:20.211 --> 14:23.047
you have every right to punish
him for as long as you like...

14:23.081 --> 14:25.315
I'm not punishing him.

14:27.118 --> 14:29.053
I'm not ready.

14:29.087 --> 14:30.921
That's real.

14:30.955 --> 14:32.990
Okay.

14:33.024 --> 14:35.959
I just think that if you offer
him even a sliver of hope,

14:35.994 --> 14:38.028
he's gonna wait around forever.

14:38.063 --> 14:41.665
And I'm not picking sides here.

14:41.700 --> 14:42.733
I'm just saying

14:42.767 --> 14:44.501
if you care about him,

14:44.536 --> 14:45.703
which I know that you do,

14:45.737 --> 14:47.504
in spite of everything,

14:47.539 --> 14:50.240
you might consider
telling him...

14:50.275 --> 14:51.208
To move on.

15:17.035 --> 15:18.168
First of all,

15:18.203 --> 15:20.037
shame on you for buying
liquor for a minor.

15:20.071 --> 15:21.138
You should be arrested.
And you,

15:21.172 --> 15:22.806
come with me.

15:22.841 --> 15:24.074
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

15:24.109 --> 15:26.176
Come with me now!

15:35.920 --> 15:37.755
- Need some help?
- <i>Nope, I got it.</i>

15:37.789 --> 15:40.691
But I was just gonna come ask you
to give me a hand at St. mark's.

15:40.725 --> 15:42.760
I need to get all this
stuff to the rummage sale.

15:42.794 --> 15:45.295
Don't we have a
bike show to go to?

15:45.330 --> 15:48.265
Rummage waits for no man...
Or woman.

15:48.299 --> 15:49.333
Do you mind?

15:49.367 --> 15:51.435
I promise I'll get
you back before 2:00.

15:51.469 --> 15:54.104
I kinda had plans.

15:54.139 --> 15:55.973
Go. Clean up.

15:56.007 --> 15:57.307
The lake of ice
will still be there.

15:57.342 --> 16:00.043
Uh, it's Mountain of ice.

16:00.078 --> 16:01.879
Um, but...

16:01.913 --> 16:04.948
I think I'm clean enough
for a rummage sale.

16:04.983 --> 16:06.817
Okay... let's go.

16:06.851 --> 16:07.918
Come on.

16:09.888 --> 16:11.855
<i>( Hip-hop music playing )</i>

16:14.893 --> 16:17.694
Bay: So I am trying
to figure you

16:17.729 --> 16:20.697
and this whole sea creature
octopus thing out.

16:20.732 --> 16:22.432
Yeah? What did you come up with?

16:22.467 --> 16:23.767
- Well, they're smart.
- That's right.

16:23.802 --> 16:25.469
And weird-looking.

16:25.503 --> 16:26.737
Hey, look who's talking?

16:26.771 --> 16:27.805
And they're deadly.

16:27.839 --> 16:29.506
And delicious.

16:30.508 --> 16:31.508
How would you know?

16:31.543 --> 16:33.644
I eat octopus all the time.

16:33.678 --> 16:35.479
No, it's these.

16:35.513 --> 16:36.647
Oh! The hair!

16:36.681 --> 16:38.682
How could I have missed that?

16:38.716 --> 16:40.384
Yeah, when I was little,
the kids at school

16:40.418 --> 16:42.352
used to call me
"octopus" 'cause

16:42.387 --> 16:43.520
they look like tentacles.

16:43.555 --> 16:45.422
I know a little bit
about ocean species

16:45.490 --> 16:47.124
and the octopus
is bad-ass.

16:47.158 --> 16:48.525
Yeah, I know. Right?

16:48.560 --> 16:50.127
So once I figured that out,

16:50.161 --> 16:52.095
it didn't really
bother me anymore.

16:52.130 --> 16:54.998
And I just started drawing tentacles
on everything I could find.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.233
It just kinda became my thing.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.235
I had a "thing." There was
this girl, I used to...

16:58.269 --> 16:59.937
- ( Police sirens blaring )
- ...Draw her with a different weapon every time.

16:59.971 --> 17:01.939
- Run!
- <i>What?</i>

17:03.041 --> 17:05.175
Zarra: <i>( Sighs ) Damn it.</i>

17:05.210 --> 17:07.778
<i>Just be cool.</i>
<i>Everything will be fine.</i>

17:07.811 --> 17:08.945
<i>I'll handle it.</i>

17:08.980 --> 17:10.814
Don't move.

17:10.848 --> 17:12.715
Drop the cans and put your
hands against the wall.

17:14.085 --> 17:15.786
- Hey, get off.
- Against the wall

17:15.819 --> 17:16.787
now!

17:21.626 --> 17:22.893
Got probable cause
for patting me down?

17:22.926 --> 17:24.661
Or you just like what you feel?

17:24.695 --> 17:26.630
No one usually comes through
this alleyway, so we were...

17:26.664 --> 17:28.432
- quiet!
- Okay.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.634
I know who you are.

17:38.710 --> 17:40.210
- Kennish?
- Yeah.

17:41.679 --> 17:43.347
Any relation to John Kennish?

17:43.381 --> 17:45.349
Third baseman for the royals.

17:50.021 --> 17:51.288
He's my dad.

17:53.858 --> 17:55.792
This is your one
and only warning.

17:55.827 --> 17:58.061
I don't wanna see you
around these guys anymore.

17:58.096 --> 17:59.997
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

18:01.165 --> 18:03.100
I'd tell you to stop
doing this crap,

18:03.134 --> 18:04.968
but I know I'd be
wasting my breath.

18:19.617 --> 18:21.551
I thought your name
was "Vasquez."

18:21.586 --> 18:23.787
Not "famous
baseball player."

18:23.821 --> 18:26.490
It is and it isn't.

18:26.524 --> 18:28.458
It's just a name.
Why does it matter?

18:28.493 --> 18:30.627
You bombed your dad's car wash?

18:30.662 --> 18:32.362
Why'd you lie?

18:32.397 --> 18:34.498
( Softly ) I don't know.

18:34.532 --> 18:35.465
<i>You don't know?</i>

18:40.305 --> 18:43.140
You know what, dude?
I don't care.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.641
Announcer over P.A. : <i>Thanks,
everybody, for coming out</i>

18:53.675 --> 18:56.477
<i>to the Kansas City</i>
<i>motorcycle show today.</i>

18:56.512 --> 18:58.446
<i>And we would like to give
a special acknowledgement</i>

18:58.480 --> 19:00.515
<i>to our sponsor,</i>
<i>Kennish car wash.</i>

19:00.549 --> 19:02.549
<i>Thanks, everybody,</i>
<i>for coming out.</i>

19:12.194 --> 19:14.328
So, pretty cool, huh?

19:14.363 --> 19:17.131
I'm thinking maybe we do
this every year, right?

19:17.165 --> 19:19.033
( Flatly ) Yeah.

19:19.067 --> 19:21.202
Hey, did you see that bike that
was painted like cousin itt

19:21.236 --> 19:23.104
from the "Addams family"?
How cool was that?

19:23.138 --> 19:25.006
It looked like
real hair, didn't it?

19:25.040 --> 19:26.307
Yeah, I saw it.

19:26.341 --> 19:28.409
Hey, how's it goin'?

19:28.443 --> 19:30.945
So, um...

19:30.979 --> 19:32.213
You're not wearing
your t-shirt.

19:32.247 --> 19:34.282
No, I'm not.

19:34.316 --> 19:36.250
I'd like it if you did.

19:36.285 --> 19:37.919
It'd mean a lot to me.

19:37.953 --> 19:40.221
A shirt proclaiming
I'm a Kennish.

19:40.255 --> 19:41.956
Which you are.

19:41.990 --> 19:43.958
I'm gonna go grab an icee
before they run out.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.440
Uh, mom? What's my

19:59.474 --> 20:01.576
guitar doing in with
the rummage sale stuff?

20:02.844 --> 20:05.479
Oh, that's not
for the rummage sale.

20:05.514 --> 20:06.614
Then what's it for?

20:06.648 --> 20:09.317
Um, remember that
group, "new dawn"?

20:09.351 --> 20:13.020
Our church group you dumped
me in when I was 12?

20:13.055 --> 20:14.322
Yes! You loved
that group and

20:14.356 --> 20:17.058
I ran into pastor Mike
at the farmer's market.

20:17.092 --> 20:18.259
Well, actually, I tried
not to run into him

20:18.293 --> 20:20.194
'cause we haven't been
to church for so long.

20:20.228 --> 20:21.929
- Mom.
- And he mentioned

20:21.964 --> 20:24.131
that new dawn was having its
big end-of-the-year party

20:24.166 --> 20:26.601
to celebrate all the good
things they do in the community.

20:26.635 --> 20:28.769
And so I mentioned
how good you are at music.

20:28.804 --> 20:29.837
You didn't.

20:29.871 --> 20:32.440
You said you didn't
wanna play for bikers.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.476
You tricked me?

20:35.510 --> 20:36.611
Honey, I'm just trying to help.

20:36.645 --> 20:38.379
Mom, I don't need your help!

20:38.413 --> 20:40.047
I told you, if I wanted
to get a gig

20:40.082 --> 20:41.315
I'd get a gig myself.

20:41.350 --> 20:44.218
Listen to me, I was stuck for
years and I didn't even know it.

20:44.252 --> 20:46.887
- But I am not stuck!
- Yes, you are!

20:46.922 --> 20:48.823
- You're...
- Hey, how's it goin'?

20:50.058 --> 20:51.726
This is not making
me feel any better.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.928
This is making me worse.
Like, 10 times worse.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.863
See that there? You admit
you're feeling bad.

20:55.897 --> 20:57.965
That's the first step
to feeling better.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.602
I can't believe this. You're reaching
a whole new level of unbelievable.

21:01.637 --> 21:03.471
Please... please just

21:03.505 --> 21:05.640
do it for me. I love
hearing you play, honey.

21:07.609 --> 21:08.643
Please.

21:10.545 --> 21:12.346
How much am I getting paid?

21:12.381 --> 21:14.482
Toby.
It's a church.

21:25.027 --> 21:25.993
Hey.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.208
I got into a huge
fight with my dad.

21:43.645 --> 21:46.280
I tagged a wall over here.

21:46.314 --> 21:48.082
He hated it.

21:48.116 --> 21:50.117
Made me paint over it.

21:50.152 --> 21:52.987
He will never
understand me ever.

21:55.290 --> 21:57.024
( Scoffs )
That wouldn't matter.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.063
What are you saying?

22:04.099 --> 22:05.866
I can't do that.

22:09.838 --> 22:11.706
If you had heard him...
the way he was going on

22:11.740 --> 22:14.542
about how vandalism
is destroying our cities.

22:16.712 --> 22:17.678
He'd hate me.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.125
I thought you were
going to meetings.

22:31.159 --> 22:32.326
I stopped going.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.261
- Where's your sponsor?
- It wasn't working for me.

22:34.296 --> 22:35.296
It's not supposed to be easy.

22:35.330 --> 22:37.064
You have to keep at it.

22:37.099 --> 22:38.199
Okay.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.934
- Can I go now?
- No.

22:39.968 --> 22:41.068
What is going on?

22:42.738 --> 22:44.739
- Talk to me.
- What do you want me to say?

22:44.773 --> 22:45.940
Maybe start with
why you're alone

22:45.974 --> 22:48.542
buying a bottle of vodka
on a Saturday afternoon.

22:53.482 --> 22:55.549
Bay and Daphne didn't tell you?

22:55.584 --> 22:57.251
Yes, they did.

23:04.526 --> 23:07.194
Everyone at school hates me.

23:09.164 --> 23:11.232
Which...

23:11.266 --> 23:12.800
They should.

23:12.834 --> 23:14.802
I mean,

23:14.836 --> 23:15.870
I hate me.

23:18.707 --> 23:19.940
Do you know how pissed

23:19.975 --> 23:21.809
Toby and Daphne
and Bay would be

23:21.843 --> 23:23.844
if they knew you were
talking to me right now?

23:23.879 --> 23:25.880
Listen to me.

23:25.914 --> 23:29.383
You are not the worst
thing you've ever done.

23:29.417 --> 23:31.619
You did something thoughtless.

23:31.653 --> 23:33.387
People suffered.

23:33.421 --> 23:35.489
You try to make
amends and you move on.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.359
God, if you only knew
the terrible things

23:38.393 --> 23:40.161
that I did when I was drunk.

23:41.997 --> 23:44.265
I tried to apologize to Toby

23:44.299 --> 23:46.834
and he wouldn't even
look at me.

23:46.868 --> 23:50.070
And Bay... she practically
spit on me.

23:51.773 --> 23:52.773
It's not their job

23:52.808 --> 23:53.808
to forgive you.

23:55.811 --> 23:57.545
You need to go back
to your meetings.

23:58.647 --> 23:59.747
Okay?

24:02.517 --> 24:05.419
Look, I know that
you're probably

24:05.453 --> 24:07.421
the worst person to be
my friend right now,

24:07.455 --> 24:09.456
but...

24:09.491 --> 24:11.325
I really need one.

24:13.428 --> 24:14.428
Okay.

24:42.591 --> 24:44.925
- <i>( Crashing sounds )</i>
<i>- Angelo: Aah!</i>

24:44.960 --> 24:45.893
( Swearing in Italian )

24:45.927 --> 24:47.862
What happened?!

24:47.896 --> 24:49.630
- Nail gun.
- Oh my God.

24:49.664 --> 24:50.598
The nail's in there still.

24:50.632 --> 24:51.665
- ( Groans )
- We need to get you

24:51.700 --> 24:52.800
- to a hospital.
- No no no no! I'm fine.

24:52.834 --> 24:54.568
Are you crazy?!
They need to clean it

24:54.603 --> 24:56.737
and check for damage. I'm
sure you need a tetanus shot.

24:56.771 --> 24:58.572
- Let's go!
- I drive... I drive myself.

24:58.607 --> 25:00.174
You can't drive like that!

25:00.208 --> 25:02.142
Or I take a cab
or ask where Toby is!

25:02.177 --> 25:03.210
Toby's out with Kathryn!

25:03.245 --> 25:04.633
Just stop arguing
with me! Let's go!

25:19.322 --> 25:20.522
"Serpent." Nice.

25:21.591 --> 25:23.425
I'm sorry?

25:23.460 --> 25:27.930
Ah... I'm sorry. You're
really good at word jumble.

25:27.964 --> 25:29.331
"Serpent" is a big word.

25:31.935 --> 25:34.737
I'm not eight, I'm 16.
That's not that impressive.

25:34.771 --> 25:37.673
Well, it's my third
language, so it is for me.

25:46.783 --> 25:48.684
( Whispering )
You need to groan.

25:48.718 --> 25:50.519
What?

25:50.553 --> 25:51.720
Make a lot of noise.

25:51.755 --> 25:53.355
Sound like you're
in a lot of pain.

25:53.390 --> 25:54.556
Make sure the nurses hear you.

25:54.591 --> 25:56.292
Really?

25:56.326 --> 25:58.227
Yeah, I spent more time
in emergency rooms

25:58.261 --> 26:00.229
than I should have
when I was little.

26:00.263 --> 26:02.331
After the meningitis,
every time I got a fever,

26:02.365 --> 26:03.399
my mom would rush me here

26:03.433 --> 26:04.967
and the only way to get seen

26:05.001 --> 26:05.968
is to groan.

26:07.037 --> 26:08.904
Before she goes back
inside... do it.

26:10.173 --> 26:11.173
Aah.

26:13.810 --> 26:15.711
That was horrible.

26:15.745 --> 26:16.745
Can you tell?

26:16.780 --> 26:18.981
Yeah, I can tell.
No one's looking at you.

26:19.015 --> 26:20.916
You have to sound
like you're about to die.

26:23.953 --> 26:26.689
( Groans loudly )

26:32.462 --> 26:34.430
- Angelo Sorrento?
- Yes, that's me.

26:34.464 --> 26:36.332
I see you listed
your companion here,

26:36.366 --> 26:38.133
<i>but you left the</i>
<i>"relationship" blank.</i>

26:38.168 --> 26:39.134
<i>I need that.</i>

26:39.169 --> 26:40.202

26:44.107 --> 26:45.240

30:50.253 --> 30:51.320
Hi.

30:55.325 --> 30:57.960
What's going on?

30:57.994 --> 31:00.796
You know the girl
that was painted here?

31:00.830 --> 31:02.097
The one that you
made me paint over?

31:02.131 --> 31:05.667
Yeah. The graffiti on the wall.

31:05.702 --> 31:06.635
I did it.

31:07.670 --> 31:08.604
That was mine.

31:10.540 --> 31:12.708
You defaced my wall?
Wha...

31:12.742 --> 31:14.343
why would you do that?

31:15.778 --> 31:17.312
I thought you would like it.

31:20.249 --> 31:22.317
Wait a second.

31:22.352 --> 31:25.087
Bay, this isn't you.

31:25.121 --> 31:28.056
You've never done anything
like this before, right?

31:28.091 --> 31:29.925
Yes, I have.

31:34.831 --> 31:37.899
I know that you think
it's just a bunch of thugs

31:37.934 --> 31:41.637

but to me, it's art.

31:41.671 --> 31:44.606
And I don't know...
I guess...

I guess I was just
trying to get you to see

31:47.910 --> 31:49.578
things differently.

31:54.617 --> 31:57.285
Say something.

31:57.320 --> 32:00.355
Please, dad,
just say something.

32:01.491 --> 32:03.325
I feel like I don't know you.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.035
I'm sorry.

32:33.437 --> 32:35.271
Terrible.

32:37.034 --> 32:39.001
I told you. I knew
that he'd be mad.

32:43.483 --> 32:45.618
It's okay. He had to
find out at some point.

33:04.972 --> 33:05.905
Hey.

33:07.007 --> 33:08.007
Do you go to Carlton?

33:12.846 --> 33:14.013
No no no.
Not at all.

33:36.403 --> 33:38.371

33:38.405 --> 33:40.172
No. It's fine.

who's interrupting.

33:43.043 --> 33:44.210
No.

33:44.244 --> 33:46.145

34:16.777 --> 34:17.777

34:17.811 --> 34:19.411
We don't have the heart
to tell her.

34:19.446 --> 34:21.414
I know what you mean.

34:21.447 --> 34:23.215
- I'm Nikki.
- Toby.

34:25.452 --> 34:27.320
So, um...

34:27.353 --> 34:29.288
We're having another
one of these next week

34:29.322 --> 34:31.958
if you wanna swing by.

34:31.992 --> 34:32.992
Do you have an electric?

34:34.027 --> 34:36.161
Well, you should come
and let's rock.

34:36.196 --> 34:37.897
Christian rock?

34:37.931 --> 34:40.900
Issues with the big man?

34:40.934 --> 34:43.703
No. Just questions.

34:43.737 --> 34:46.639
That's why they call it faith.

34:46.672 --> 34:47.706
Mm.

34:47.741 --> 34:49.507
Well, what if I told you

34:49.543 --> 34:50.876
I was the best songwriter
in the world,

34:50.911 --> 34:53.612
but refused to play
for you to prove it?

34:53.647 --> 34:55.447
Would you take it on faith?

34:56.483 --> 34:59.385
No. Probably not.

35:01.388 --> 35:03.456
But if you really are
a rock God,

35:03.490 --> 35:05.424
we would love to have
you come play with us.

35:07.494 --> 35:10.329
This was kind of
a one-time thing for me.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.266
Okay.

35:14.301 --> 35:16.168
I'm glad you came.

35:16.203 --> 35:17.169
See ya.

35:20.140 --> 35:21.707
- Hi.
- Nikki: <i>Hi.</i>

35:23.810 --> 35:25.611
She's cute.

35:25.645 --> 35:28.547
Please don't tell me you
brought me here to meet girls.

35:28.582 --> 35:29.949
No. Of course not.

35:29.983 --> 35:32.785
I just thought you
seemed a little adrift.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.388
You know?

35:35.422 --> 35:36.522
Your best friend moved away,

35:36.556 --> 35:39.358
your band broke up,

35:39.393 --> 35:41.327
your girlfriend...

35:43.430 --> 35:46.465
Just, when you feel
a little lost,

35:46.500 --> 35:48.167
this place can help.

35:54.041 --> 35:55.307
Come on.
Let's go home.

36:03.950 --> 36:07.119
( Sighs ) There's still
nothing from my mom.

36:07.154 --> 36:09.989
You can go if you need to.
You don't have to wait for me.

36:10.023 --> 36:11.590
How are you gonna get home?

36:11.625 --> 36:13.759
I'll take a cab.
It's fine.

36:13.794 --> 36:16.595
No, I'm not gonna leave just
'cause it's hard to stick it out.

36:22.302 --> 36:25.337
At some point, you're
gonna have to forgive me.

36:25.372 --> 36:27.339
Leaving you and Regina
was wrong!

36:27.374 --> 36:30.142
But I'm here now
trying to make up for it.

36:31.445 --> 36:33.245
- I know.
- No, you don't.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.114
I see it every time
you look at me.

36:35.148 --> 36:37.083
I'm always gonna be
the bad guy.

36:37.117 --> 36:39.085
"This is guy who left me
when I went deaf."

36:39.119 --> 36:41.821
Can we move beyond this?

36:41.855 --> 36:43.789
Ever?

36:47.994 --> 36:49.528
Angelo Sorrento?

36:49.563 --> 36:51.497
<i>Can you come with me, please?</i>

37:04.914 --> 37:05.980
Does it hurt?

37:07.283 --> 37:10.685
( Exhales ) The painkillers
are kicking in.

37:10.719 --> 37:11.719
Six stitches.

37:11.754 --> 37:14.789
So, you'll still be able
to make your date?

37:14.823 --> 37:16.558
My date?

37:16.592 --> 37:18.593
With the nurse
that you met in the E.R.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.428
What?

37:20.462 --> 37:21.563
That's how it works, right?

37:21.597 --> 37:23.431
Walk into a hospital,
you meet a nurse,

37:23.465 --> 37:24.566
you spend the weekend with her.

37:25.768 --> 37:27.535
Kathryn told you.

37:27.570 --> 37:29.604
Not my business.
But, um,

37:29.638 --> 37:32.373
most fathers who had just found out
that their daughter had been switched

37:32.408 --> 37:35.510
might look for her first, instead of
hooking up with a 25-year-old nurse

37:35.544 --> 37:37.078
in the hospital
where it happened.

37:37.112 --> 37:39.180
It wasn't like that.

37:39.214 --> 37:41.182
It was a lot to deal with.

37:41.216 --> 37:42.216
I was nervous about
seeing you again.

37:42.251 --> 37:44.218
Oh, way to work up the courage.

37:44.253 --> 37:46.254
It was nothing. It was
over before it started.

37:48.324 --> 37:51.125
Doesn't matter. You will
always be that guy.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.193
What guy?

37:52.227 --> 37:54.028
The guy that women
throw themselves at.

37:54.063 --> 37:56.030
And the guy that
takes them up on it.

37:56.065 --> 37:58.866
Gina!
Can we ever move on?

38:00.603 --> 38:01.970
We have to stop arguing.

38:02.004 --> 38:05.707
I have so much I could
be angry at you for.

38:08.677 --> 38:09.777
But we are here now.

38:14.216 --> 38:16.384
You're right. I'm sorry.

38:19.521 --> 38:21.389
Anyway,

38:21.423 --> 38:23.391
we keep coming back together.

38:23.425 --> 38:24.959
What does that mean?

38:26.996 --> 38:30.932
That I am a really
slow learner.

38:30.966 --> 38:32.867
Come on,
even our injuries match.

38:42.711 --> 38:47.615
So that time Emmett was
arrested for the billboard?

38:47.650 --> 38:49.751
- That was part of this?
- Yeah.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.453
I'm just realizing this myself.

38:52.488 --> 38:54.656
- How long has it been going on?
- I have no idea.

38:54.690 --> 38:57.425
I was too stunned
to ask a lot of questions

38:57.459 --> 38:59.360
and she's been locked
in her room all night, so...

39:00.429 --> 39:02.497
I can't believe
we didn't know that.

39:02.531 --> 39:05.199
All this time.

39:05.234 --> 39:07.368
Well, I wouldn't call us
absent parents,

39:07.403 --> 39:11.039
but we did miss something else
pretty big for 16 years.

39:13.175 --> 39:16.044
Well, we must be doing
something right.

39:17.346 --> 39:19.981
She felt like
she could tell you.

39:20.015 --> 39:22.083
( Chuckles ) Yeah.

39:23.952 --> 39:25.853
So how are we gonna
handle this one?

40:00.556 --> 40:02.423
It's looking really good.

40:04.393 --> 40:06.294
Don't worry. I don't think
I can injure myself

40:06.328 --> 40:07.328
with a paintbrush.

40:08.330 --> 40:10.865
Hey, I got you something.

40:10.899 --> 40:11.833
Oh.

40:13.902 --> 40:15.203
The guy at the hardware store

40:15.237 --> 40:17.705
said these were the
closest to lead they had.

40:22.111 --> 40:24.946
( Chuckles )

40:24.980 --> 40:26.814
( Chuckles )

40:28.817 --> 40:30.785
Thank you.

40:33.756 --> 40:35.389
You're welcome.

40:38.627 --> 40:40.328
Zarra.

40:40.362 --> 40:41.562
Hey.

40:41.597 --> 40:43.731
Oh. Come on.
Hey. Look.

40:43.766 --> 40:45.700
I asked around. I heard
that you worked here.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.602
- Good for you.
- Can you just wait for a second?

40:47.636 --> 40:49.537
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you my real name.

40:51.406 --> 40:53.307
The truth is:
I'm...

40:53.342 --> 40:56.110
I'm kinda Bay Vasquez
and Bay Kennish

40:56.145 --> 40:57.311
all at the same time.

40:57.346 --> 40:59.447
- It's complicated.
- No, it's not.

40:59.481 --> 41:02.150
You either are who you say
you are, or you're not.

41:02.184 --> 41:04.352
The Vasquez side is biological

41:04.386 --> 41:07.088
and the Kennish side...

41:07.122 --> 41:09.824
they're the people
who raised me.

41:09.858 --> 41:10.958
So what, you're adopted?

41:10.993 --> 41:13.661
There's more to it than that.

41:13.695 --> 41:16.030
Kinda... yeah.

41:18.634 --> 41:19.667
Why didn't you just tell me?

41:22.671 --> 41:25.873
Probably because I thought
you were gonna react

41:25.908 --> 41:28.876
the exact way you reacted.

41:28.911 --> 41:30.678
I didn't get mad at you
'cause you're some

41:30.712 --> 41:32.013
famous baseball player's kid.

41:32.047 --> 41:33.681
I could care less.

41:33.715 --> 41:35.783
Oh, come on.

41:35.818 --> 41:37.618
All right.

41:37.653 --> 41:39.720
Fine. It's a little weird.

41:39.755 --> 41:41.956
I've never been friends
with someone like you before.

41:44.092 --> 41:45.893
And you know, that's not it.
I guess I thought...

41:45.928 --> 41:48.763
I thought we were...

41:48.797 --> 41:50.031
Kinda the same.

41:52.935 --> 41:55.069
Well, I don't know
if we're the same.

41:55.103 --> 41:57.738
We're not.

41:57.773 --> 42:01.642
I just know that you get
this huge part of my life

42:01.677 --> 42:03.077
that no one else gets.

42:05.814 --> 42:06.881
I had someone who got it.
