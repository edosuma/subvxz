01:22.280 --> 01:23.093
Hello.

01:23.146 --> 01:24.188
Hi mom!

01:24.522 --> 01:27.514
Chloe, welcome home.
You're home, right?

01:27.515 --> 01:29.381
Yup, safe and sound.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.341
Your brother has been
bouncing off the walls.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.792
Oh, I can't wait to see him.

01:34.908 --> 01:37.317
So, is everything up for
dad's surprise party?

01:37.546 --> 01:41.738
Um, honey, I'm afraid your dad's not
gonna be here when you get home.

01:41.957 --> 01:43.000
What?

01:43.959 --> 01:46.201
Why not?
Mom, what happened?

01:46.827 --> 01:48.172
He got called in to work.

01:48.423 --> 01:52.594
Did you tell him I was coming?
Yeah, honey, I did but...

01:53.178 --> 01:54.480
They called this morning
and, eh...

01:54.481 --> 01:55.576
What is his flight?

01:57.286 --> 02:00.279
It's London.
3:35?

02:02.865 --> 02:05.701
Honey, don't make it hard...
Tell raymie I'll be home before supper.

02:22.031 --> 02:24.002
You must feel like
you've seen it all.

02:24.138 --> 02:27.986
You seemed to be in the middle of a new
disaster every time I turned on the news.

02:28.007 --> 02:32.073
Oh, what is the old adage? 'It's a
dirty job but someone's gotta do it'.

02:32.084 --> 02:34.816
Can I ask you a question,
Mr. Williams?

02:34.899 --> 02:35.890
Yeah, sure.

02:35.932 --> 02:37.903
- Do you read the Bible?
- Well...

02:39.071 --> 02:41.907
I guess not as often as you do.

02:42.001 --> 02:45.470
Well, Matthew 24:7 says
there shall be famines,

02:45.483 --> 02:48.893
pestilences and earthquakes
in diverse places.

02:48.894 --> 02:52.960
All of these things, the disasters,
the wars, they are all signs.

02:53.138 --> 02:56.130
So, god knew all these things
were going to happen?

02:56.172 --> 02:58.039
Honey, god knows everything.

02:58.070 --> 03:00.875
So, why didn't he do something?

03:01.042 --> 03:03.411
I mean, he is god, right?
Couldn't he stop the flood if

03:03.424 --> 03:05.891
he wanted to? Maybe, sent a
little rain for the famine...

03:05.933 --> 03:11.021
It's a fallen world. God created it perfect
and we destroyed it on the first set...

03:11.032 --> 03:13.065
Who destroyed it?
Me?...

03:13.972 --> 03:15.099
You? Him?

03:15.140 --> 03:18.112
The lord works...
In mysterious ways, I know.

03:19.051 --> 03:24.160
But somehow, people keep believing
he loves them. Now, that is mysterious.

03:30.198 --> 03:32.106
Sorry to interrupt.

04:27.019 --> 04:28.177
Going my way?

04:55.206 --> 04:57.239
I enjoyed your speech.

04:59.148 --> 05:01.212
Yeah, sorry about that...
Now, don't be.

05:01.254 --> 05:03.225
That was really good.

05:04.028 --> 05:06.051
I'm assuming it's not your first time
making it.

05:06.166 --> 05:09.127
Well, the first time aloud.
Cameron Williams.

05:10.170 --> 05:12.162
'Buck'... my friends.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.284
I'm... eh, Chloe Steele.

05:19.294 --> 05:21.223
'Chloe' to my friends.

05:23.163 --> 05:25.029
So, you're in college.

05:25.071 --> 05:29.096
Wow, that investigative journalism.
It really pays off.

05:29.138 --> 05:33.089
I just wanted to say thank you
for rescuing me from that nutty lady.

05:33.090 --> 05:34.320
Oh, thank my mom.

05:34.321 --> 05:36.312
She, as you would,
have been rehearsing for it.

05:36.333 --> 05:39.189
Oh, is she... pretty?

05:39.190 --> 05:41.193
Nutty...

05:43.309 --> 05:46.600
Actually, I was looking
through the thesaurus I've

05:46.613 --> 05:50.046
found this morning, I've
decided to go with 'wacko'.

05:50.254 --> 05:52.151
Wacko?

05:52.152 --> 05:54.144
I like that word, 'wacko'.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.263
Can I buy you a coffee?

05:59.170 --> 06:01.329
No, no, I'm fine.

06:01.339 --> 06:03.133
Come on!

06:03.279 --> 06:08.222
What if I throw in one of those fantastic
little boxes with the strawberry jam...

06:08.253 --> 06:12.194
Oh, my god...
Wow, well, that is... that's tempting.

06:12.195 --> 06:13.321
- Yes?
- Hmm hmm.

06:13.331 --> 06:18.305
But I'm waiting for someone, and he
should be here any minute.

06:22.310 --> 06:24.374
My dad.

06:25.354 --> 06:29.087
I flew home to surprise him
for his birthday, but...

06:29.088 --> 06:31.090
Something came up.

06:42.289 --> 06:44.281
Well, have a safe flight...

06:48.129 --> 06:50.235
- Hi, sweet heart!
- Hi!

06:52.248 --> 06:56.148
What are you doing here? Well, I came
home to surprise you on your birthday.

06:56.221 --> 06:59.245
Honey, I just got called in.
There's no way I can get out of it now.

06:59.287 --> 07:02.790
Yeah, that's what mom said... I wished that
you would've told me you would be coming.

07:03.166 --> 07:07.327
Oh wait... you, you're Cameron Williams,
holy cow...

07:07.368 --> 07:10.267
- So you two?
- Oh, we just met.

07:10.382 --> 07:12.311
Hi, it's a pleasure, captain.
Ray.

07:13.156 --> 07:16.259
Well, I'm gonna let you
two catch up, yeah. And

07:16.271 --> 07:19.193
eh... it was really nice
to meet you, Chloe.

07:19.235 --> 07:21.352
- You look great.
- Thank you.

07:21.362 --> 07:23.302
Let's talk somewhere.

07:24.303 --> 07:26.399
- How was school?
- It's good.

07:26.451 --> 07:28.412
Good, yeah...

07:33.250 --> 07:34.418
What?

07:35.398 --> 07:39.298
You know the first thing I thought
when mom told me you're not gonna be home?

07:39.371 --> 07:40.435
It's that you left.

07:41.238 --> 07:44.983
I mean, really left. Just
packed up your bags, slammed

07:44.996 --> 07:48.412
the doors, squealed the
tyres and just drove off.

07:49.246 --> 07:51.384
Your mom and I are fine, Chloe.

07:51.468 --> 07:55.295
It's okay, I don't blame you.

07:55.336 --> 07:58.360
You don't blame me for what?
For running away.

07:58.371 --> 08:01.374
But I didn't run away.
You said, you thought I run away.

08:02.417 --> 08:05.410
- Who is that girl?
- What girl?

08:06.358 --> 08:10.321
That flight attendant,
beautiful, blonde one.

08:11.301 --> 08:15.326
Flight attendant... I worked with
dozens of flight attendants...

08:15.379 --> 08:17.370
don't even know her name.

08:19.279 --> 08:26.390
If this was a year ago, you know before mom
drank with collate, you'd be home by now.

08:27.225 --> 08:30.405
We would be all be home,
like a family or something.

08:31.239 --> 08:33.767
Chloe, I...
I think you know that your mom and

08:33.779 --> 08:36.265
I got married when we
were both very young...

08:36.318 --> 08:41.260
And the changes that a person goes
through between 20 and 50 are enormous.

08:41.427 --> 08:47.392
She's just doing what she believes is right
and maybe you should cut her some slack.

08:47.434 --> 08:52.387
Me?... how about you?
You're the one on the way to London.

08:52.418 --> 08:55.285
You are a one who has not been home
since Christmas.

08:55.286 --> 08:57.444
I have school. And I have a job.

08:58.456 --> 09:02.491
I just feel like she's always trying
to shove it down my throat.

09:04.275 --> 09:09.343
I know... look, I know that this past year,
has been something of an adjustment, but...

09:09.478 --> 09:14.326
She is your mother, and I think it'd
be good if you, no, if we both...

09:14.327 --> 09:16.517
Could be a little more supportive.

09:18.373 --> 09:21.460
- You missed her...
- Yes, I do.

09:22.273 --> 09:26.309
But hey, if she's gonna run off with
another man, why not Jesus, huh?

09:28.551 --> 09:30.386
Where is your ring?

09:35.464 --> 09:39.500
It's in my car.
I never wear it when I fly.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.963
Chloe, your mom means the
world to me, I'm not

09:44.975 --> 09:47.352
going to do anything to mess it up.
Okay?

09:48.332 --> 09:51.356
And I have to go.
We'll talk when I get back.

09:51.534 --> 09:53.503
Not gonna be here
when you get back.

09:53.504 --> 09:57.342
Oh, but you'll gonna be back home
again soon, right?

09:59.354 --> 10:00.408
Here...

10:00.522 --> 10:05.382
The car is in the usual spot, and
go easy on mom. She'll come around.

10:06.362 --> 10:08.364
I love you.

10:38.355 --> 10:39.522
Are you okay?

10:41.399 --> 10:44.465
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

10:50.451 --> 10:53.444
Investigative journalist, remember?

10:54.591 --> 10:57.500
- Right.
- Yeah.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.574
So...

11:08.616 --> 11:11.651
I'm just a little disappointed,
that's all.

11:12.495 --> 11:16.531
It was a big deal to me.
All of us together, having a good time.

11:16.573 --> 11:19.471
Well, I'm sure you would have stayed
if he could.

11:24.018 --> 11:26.655
The Turkey... a vulture

11:26.656 --> 11:30.556
comes up to the gate and dropped
two dead rabbits onto the floor.

11:30.629 --> 11:33.601
And the flight attendant says...
"I'm sorry...

11:33.632 --> 11:36.511
We only allowed one carrier."

11:36.573 --> 11:39.482
I'm sorry captain, that's bad.

11:39.555 --> 11:42.413
That is always funny.

11:42.454 --> 11:45.614
Well, if you have anymore bad jokes,
you can always come and find me.

11:54.718 --> 11:57.647
Hey Marcus, they got that
computer problems figured out?

11:57.648 --> 11:59.971
Negative that, Pentagon,
apparently, some of

11:59.984 --> 12:02.424
the equipment on the
flight deck are outdated.

12:03.466 --> 12:07.596
Yeah, you had me flying east, in
6 hours time, I would be 9 hours older.

12:07.815 --> 12:10.234
Do that for about 6 years
and maybe you'll catch up

12:10.247 --> 12:12.538
to me. Happy birthday
buddy, have a good flight.

12:12.539 --> 12:13.675
Thanks.

12:17.586 --> 12:19.692
Sounds like that's all
your mom talks about.

12:20.558 --> 12:22.695
Seems like it sometimes.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.539
Hate someone who sees
earthquake on the news and

12:28.552 --> 12:31.715
then tries to convince
everyone it's a good thing.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.583
Does that make sense to you?

12:35.761 --> 12:40.725
The day after Tsunami,
there's that one woman, Medina.

12:41.476 --> 12:43.762
She lost three of her four
children in that wave,

12:43.774 --> 12:45.751
dragged down to the sea
while she watched.

12:46.513 --> 12:50.684
It was all she could do was to hold on to a
tree with a six-week old baby in her arms.

12:52.561 --> 12:55.653
And she was so sure that
god had saved her and

12:55.665 --> 12:58.703
the baby that she went
straight to her knees.

12:59.568 --> 13:03.489
She thanked him.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.741
She thanked him for
killing the others?

13:07.525 --> 13:11.607
She's got the chance, that
night she refused to leave

13:11.620 --> 13:15.867
the evacuation and after all
god was watching over her.

13:17.681 --> 13:19.704
- And...
- Mudslide...

13:21.686 --> 13:24.625
Buried the whole village
under 10-feet of slime.

13:24.626 --> 13:27.755
How do people see some things 'like that',
and just...

13:28.631 --> 13:32.666
If you look hard enough, you'll see
whatever it is you're looking for.

13:33.709 --> 13:37.546
But you might have to ignore
a lot of other things to do it.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.592
One of them...

13:41.759 --> 13:43.782
Might be the truth.

13:44.762 --> 13:46.754
And what about you?

13:47.641 --> 13:49.726
What did you see in that village?

13:52.615 --> 13:57.683
I saw a lot of people who'd lost everything
that ever mattered.

13:58.631 --> 14:01.603
Did you ask why?

14:01.635 --> 14:03.720
I know why.

14:03.762 --> 14:05.795
Tsunami.

14:05.806 --> 14:07.683
You know what I mean.

14:08.705 --> 14:10.769
No, no, I didn't.

14:11.823 --> 14:15.785
If you had to find a reason for something
like that to happen, then...

14:17.798 --> 14:20.791
Well, you might end up behind
a stranger at the airport?

14:23.742 --> 14:25.608
Oh...

14:25.775 --> 14:28.810
- Love that laugh.
- Oh, no.

14:33.669 --> 14:34.826
What?

14:34.837 --> 14:38.789
Oh, just thinking about Ray's joke.
That guy cracks me up.

14:38.841 --> 14:42.710
Ray?
You mean captain Steele?

14:43.586 --> 14:45.651
Only in front of other people.

14:46.662 --> 14:47.715
Really?

14:47.757 --> 14:49.728
So, you two are...?

14:54.608 --> 14:56.631
No, not yet.

14:56.641 --> 14:59.613
But, we're planning on spending
some time together in London.

14:59.645 --> 15:01.845
Really?
Why didn't you tell me?

15:01.855 --> 15:03.680
Hey, wait...
Where are you going?

15:03.722 --> 15:06.652
Ah, some details, please...

15:07.831 --> 15:10.698
I really needed someone
to talk to today.

15:10.740 --> 15:11.866
Thank you.

15:12.878 --> 15:14.807
I'm going to call you
from London.

15:15.641 --> 15:17.633
- Really?
- Really.

15:18.644 --> 15:21.627
I'm gonna make sure you won't forget
about me, right? Right, right.

15:21.658 --> 15:25.631
I'm sure you've got a girl at every
airport. Do you call all of them?

15:25.662 --> 15:26.653
None of them, actually.

15:26.663 --> 15:27.873
Chloe.

15:28.770 --> 15:29.812
Oh, hi, Jim.

15:29.844 --> 15:32.637
I got these things for your dad.

15:32.638 --> 15:33.848
They're for tomorrow night.

15:36.653 --> 15:38.916
U2. Wow.

15:38.926 --> 15:40.887
These can't be easy to get.

15:40.928 --> 15:44.630
You're telling me.
It took me two weeks to find these things.

15:45.704 --> 15:47.675
Two weeks?

15:52.722 --> 15:54.787
Chloe, I'm sorry...

15:56.925 --> 15:58.687
Mr. Williams, please.

15:58.729 --> 16:00.668
I'm coming, sorry.

16:00.866 --> 16:02.733
Chloe, I...

16:06.779 --> 16:08.844
Would you give these to my dad, please?

16:09.824 --> 16:11.649
Of course.

16:13.828 --> 16:15.768
Well, you...

16:17.937 --> 16:20.669
- Excuse me...
- Thanks.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.916
- Mr. Williams, please...
- Sorry.

16:41.785 --> 16:43.840
Excuse me, captain.

16:44.893 --> 16:47.729
Chloe asked me to
give you these.

16:49.867 --> 16:52.964
You are the gwn guy, right?

16:53.006 --> 16:55.779
Gwn guy... yeah, that's me.

16:55.811 --> 16:58.792
Cameron Williams, Chris Smith...
Hi, pleased to meet you.

16:58.793 --> 16:59.951
Pleased to meet you.

18:05.052 --> 18:08.858
Welcome aboard
pancon flight 257 to London.

18:08.889 --> 18:11.830
Flight time today will be
6 hours and 30 minutes.

18:11.861 --> 18:14.019
Thank you and enjoy your flight.

18:14.979 --> 18:17.836
So, did you get her number?

18:19.849 --> 18:22.984
Come on... I saw you two at the
lounge about an hour ago and

18:22.997 --> 18:25.886
you happened to be the last
person to get on the plane.

18:26.095 --> 18:30.026
And to think, I could have spend
the last time with you instead.

18:32.070 --> 18:36.064
I do not know why you uncaring guys
always wanted to get the girls...

18:36.074 --> 18:40.016
Maybe because we do not want to go around
like a dress rehearsal for glee.

18:41.924 --> 18:44.020
You know what, I'm must say
right on that one.

18:44.062 --> 18:47.826
I will have to thank you though
for flying first class.

18:47.837 --> 18:49.860
No need to thank, man.

18:49.870 --> 18:52.071
But, that guy who's sitting tight
back there...

18:52.112 --> 18:53.875
Now, you should.

19:02.957 --> 19:05.022
I know you!

19:05.074 --> 19:08.912
Look, George. It's frank Sinatra!

19:08.953 --> 19:11.008
- What's that?
- It is frank...

19:11.049 --> 19:12.113
Oh!

19:12.123 --> 19:14.084
Listen, George.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.858
We're home!

19:18.171 --> 19:21.133
Oh... we're not home.

19:22.947 --> 19:26.138
Sometimes he gets a bit confused.

19:31.019 --> 19:34.688
Good afternoon, this is your
captain rayford Steele on flight

19:34.701 --> 19:38.026
pancon 257, weather conditions
are reported to be good.

19:38.036 --> 19:41.244
So, will be a nice smooth
flight all the way to London.

19:41.257 --> 19:44.074
Please sit back and enjoy
our excellent service.

19:45.086 --> 19:47.488
We will be serving
complimentary drinks and

19:47.501 --> 19:50.081
snacks shortly. So, please
sit back and relax.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.919
No Johnny, you don't have to tell them
anything. Just do what you do best.

19:54.930 --> 19:57.368
Stall 'em! But if you
see one thing that

19:57.380 --> 20:00.070
makes you think they
smell an acquisition...

20:00.112 --> 20:02.979
Dish it all.

20:02.980 --> 20:04.116
Look!

20:04.158 --> 20:07.722
I left the company jet in Houston.
I'll be in London and

20:07.735 --> 20:11.124
with the paper signed before
they know that I'm gone.

20:11.134 --> 20:14.138
We'll go and get. Good!

20:42.199 --> 20:45.035
Chloe, Chloe!

20:45.077 --> 20:46.933
Hey! Come here!

20:46.975 --> 20:48.967
Oh god, oh my goodness!

20:49.008 --> 20:51.042
You are so big!

20:51.083 --> 20:52.950
Ok.

20:53.179 --> 20:55.088
Did you get me anything
at the airport?

20:55.119 --> 20:58.101
Well, you'll just have to
wait and see.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.960
Alright, check it out in there
and see what you've got.

21:02.001 --> 21:05.067
The new baseball gloves that
I've been asking for!

21:05.078 --> 21:07.069
No way! Mom!

21:07.111 --> 21:09.238
Chloe is here!

21:12.158 --> 21:14.119
Mom, Chloe is here!

21:16.100 --> 21:18.039
She is here, mom!

21:19.239 --> 21:22.002
- Hi!
- Hey...

21:22.012 --> 21:24.077
My gosh...

21:24.984 --> 21:27.216
Oh, you look beautiful.

21:27.258 --> 21:29.154
Wow.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.022
So,

21:32.034 --> 21:34.119
um, can I get you
something to drink?

21:34.161 --> 21:35.965
Yeah... yeah... sure.

21:36.007 --> 21:38.999
Mom... mom... Chloe got me a brand new
baseball gloves. See?

21:52.076 --> 21:55.131
6 hours to London.
Nobody laughing at that too.

21:55.173 --> 21:58.019
The hyperjet...
That'll change everything.

21:58.020 --> 21:59.208
Oh yeah?
Why is that?

21:59.219 --> 22:01.242
The defence deartment.

22:04.089 --> 22:07.154
Did you say the defence department?
Yeah.

22:07.165 --> 22:09.680
It seems that they've been
developing a new jet,

22:09.693 --> 22:12.014
ok? It'll carry 300
passengers at mach 40...

22:12.045 --> 22:14.140
New York to London... 6 minutes.

22:14.141 --> 22:17.061
6 minutes?
6 minutes.

22:17.082 --> 22:20.148
That's pretty fast.
Personally, I think they're lying.

22:20.189 --> 22:22.181
Yeah, I think that's
a good guess.

22:22.202 --> 22:25.320
There's no way they can develop themselves.
I'm guessing they...

22:25.330 --> 22:28.062
Referred engineering
from something else.

22:28.104 --> 22:30.200
Probably something from area 51.

22:31.284 --> 22:33.047
Yeah.

22:33.318 --> 22:35.225
Scotch, please!

22:35.226 --> 22:39.314
So, was your dad surprised?

22:41.066 --> 22:43.266
Yeah. I think he was.

22:43.276 --> 22:46.040
Must have meant a lot to him.

22:46.071 --> 22:48.136
He seemed very upset that
he had to leave.

22:49.147 --> 22:51.181
Yeah, I could tell.

22:52.119 --> 22:53.318
So, how was your flight?

22:53.360 --> 22:56.155
Good. Yeah, it was good.

22:57.093 --> 22:58.230
School?

22:58.240 --> 23:00.211
It's fine.

23:01.369 --> 23:05.144
Hey, you'll eh... you'll never
guess who I met at the airport.

23:05.185 --> 23:06.374
Buck Williams.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.346
Sorry, Cameron Williams.

23:09.356 --> 23:11.286
- From the news?
- Yeah!

23:11.327 --> 23:13.194
- Really?
- Hm-hmm.

23:13.204 --> 23:15.227
Did you get a chance
to talk to him?

23:15.238 --> 23:17.208
I did... actually.

23:17.209 --> 23:19.336
Erm, he is...

23:19.378 --> 23:21.347
He is a great guy.

23:21.348 --> 23:25.155
Hmm, so just happens
to be gorgeous.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.157
Yes...

23:27.199 --> 23:28.252
I told him that you were a fan.

23:28.293 --> 23:29.357
Oh!

23:29.367 --> 23:32.775
By the way, you're not
the only one who thinks

23:32.788 --> 23:36.208
every earthquake will be
the end of the world.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.378
Some crazy lady cornered him
at the airport.

23:44.290 --> 23:47.241
That's not how I learnt that.

23:49.368 --> 23:51.360
Anyway, hmm...

23:52.277 --> 23:55.145
He is a great guy.

23:59.160 --> 24:00.286
Chloe, honey...

24:01.287 --> 24:03.394
I don't mean to push.

24:03.435 --> 24:06.334
I know it must feel that way.

24:07.377 --> 24:11.183
I just want you to understand.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.321
It's important to me.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.250
So are you.

24:16.199 --> 24:17.388
I just want you to be ready.

24:17.429 --> 24:19.327
Ready for what?

24:20.370 --> 24:21.433
You know...

24:21.434 --> 24:23.300
Never mind.

24:24.406 --> 24:27.178
Can we just talk without
you cutting me off?

24:27.179 --> 24:29.234
Mom, I just got here.

24:29.286 --> 24:32.247
I'm not really up for a
heavy conversation.

24:33.290 --> 24:36.198
Ok, sure...
But just hear me out.

24:36.199 --> 24:37.430
Just a little.

24:38.337 --> 24:44.177
I've been praying for you to come home and
I believe that's why god brought you here.

24:44.208 --> 24:45.449
What did you say?

24:45.480 --> 24:48.181
God brought me home?

24:48.191 --> 24:51.247
God did not bring me home,
I brought me home.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.426
I bought the ticket,
I got on on the flight.

24:53.458 --> 24:56.263
God had nothing to do with it.

24:56.273 --> 24:57.462
And let me ask you something.

24:57.472 --> 25:00.277
If god brought me home
for dad's birthday...

25:00.309 --> 25:02.467
Then why did he let him
fly off to London?

25:04.219 --> 25:06.555
Maybe it's important
for us to talk.

25:06.659 --> 25:07.702
I don't think so.

25:08.223 --> 25:13.260
One thing I do know for sure, god is
the reason dad is not here right now.

25:18.484 --> 25:20.351
Chloe!

25:27.369 --> 25:29.340
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.399
Can I give you a hand
with your bag?

25:46.400 --> 25:48.464
Did I ask for a hand?

25:49.351 --> 25:51.395
I, I can put it on the top
for you.

25:51.405 --> 25:53.355
Yeah?
So could I!

26:04.502 --> 26:06.473
What are you looking at?

26:07.349 --> 26:09.383
Want to ask me a question?

26:09.549 --> 26:12.323
Wonder how I drive?

26:12.521 --> 26:15.326
Maybe, where I buy my clothes?

26:15.566 --> 26:18.330
How do I reach the urinal?

26:18.340 --> 26:20.394
What is a urinal?

26:24.378 --> 26:26.370
That's my dad.

26:26.380 --> 26:28.445
He plays football.

26:28.455 --> 26:30.447
That's nice, kid.

26:30.530 --> 26:34.461
He's going to be on TV tomorrow
if his arm felt better.

26:35.431 --> 26:37.465
Your dad plays ball on TV?

26:38.341 --> 26:39.394
What team?

26:39.477 --> 26:42.314
Gooo... jets!

26:43.450 --> 26:46.421
Oh. What's wrong with his arm?

26:46.422 --> 26:48.487
Cosmo. He's my dog.

26:48.497 --> 26:50.468
He knocked daddy off
the hammock.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.396
Oh, really?

26:52.397 --> 26:55.578
Daddy was so mad.
He pushed cosmo onto the floor.

26:55.609 --> 26:58.444
What did I tell you about
bothering other passengers?

26:58.446 --> 26:59.509
Sorry...

27:08.498 --> 27:11.439
So, you're a bad man.

27:11.470 --> 27:13.368
Yup.

27:13.378 --> 27:15.578
You're gonna give the kid a cut?

27:16.580 --> 27:21.387
Her dad's pk carvell.
Doubt she needs the money.

27:26.403 --> 27:27.569
Where are you going?

27:27.570 --> 27:30.334
- Out!
- Can I come?

27:30.376 --> 27:31.543
Raymie, not now!

27:31.575 --> 27:33.556
Please.

27:36.351 --> 27:39.416
Alright, get your stuff.
Awesome!

27:59.511 --> 28:03.536
Can we go to the mall?
Yes, we can.

28:03.578 --> 28:08.385
I heard there's 80% off
for games stuff.

28:18.437 --> 28:20.408
Do you think mom is crazy?

28:20.450 --> 28:21.493
What?

28:22.452 --> 28:23.610
No.

28:23.651 --> 28:26.488
No, I was just upset.

28:29.564 --> 28:33.558
Dad says pastor Bruce
was washing her brains.

28:33.568 --> 28:35.633
Oh, that's just a joke.

28:36.478 --> 28:37.635
It is?

28:39.543 --> 28:40.711
I don't get it.

28:41.723 --> 28:44.424
Neither do I...

29:06.499 --> 29:08.564
So this is kinda sucked.

29:09.607 --> 29:13.455
What is that?
Got to fly on your birthday?

29:13.486 --> 29:15.582
Well, you have gotta
pay the bills, right?

29:16.458 --> 29:18.481
So how long is Chloe
going to be in town?

29:20.785 --> 29:22.746
Well, looks like smooth sailing.

29:22.756 --> 29:26.698
I wanna stretch my legs and see
how's the crew is doing.

30:36.001 --> 30:39.766
Raymie, what are you trying to do?
Scare me to death!

30:40.809 --> 30:41.904
What was that?

30:42.946 --> 30:44.917
- Come on.
- Can I have it?

30:44.948 --> 30:47.044
No you can't.
Only a few hundred dollars.

30:47.055 --> 30:48.786
No!

31:01.988 --> 31:03.854
I got 'em.

31:11.863 --> 31:15.867
I'm going to find a way
to pay you back.

31:18.787 --> 31:20.987
- What's wrong?
- No...

31:21.029 --> 31:25.054
I just thought the seats should be
a liitle closer to the stage.

31:25.961 --> 31:27.932
- Coffee?
- Uhuh...

31:51.885 --> 31:53.084
She'll be ok.

31:53.856 --> 31:54.846
Huh?

31:54.857 --> 31:56.827
Mom.

31:59.935 --> 32:03.074
She still wears that necklace, you know.
The one you made her.

32:03.877 --> 32:06.004
She never takes it off.

32:09.111 --> 32:12.854
They're gonna be alright, right?
Mom and dad?

32:12.855 --> 32:15.066
Hmm?
Yes, yes of course.

32:15.097 --> 32:18.934
Dad's being called in to work,
he's got something to do, ok?

32:19.101 --> 32:21.071
Did dad tell you about my game?

32:21.072 --> 32:22.876
Are you kidding me?

32:22.949 --> 32:24.847
You're all we talk about.

32:24.920 --> 32:28.080
He said that you were the greatest baseball
player in the whole world.

32:28.121 --> 32:30.051
- And you know what?
- What?

32:30.092 --> 32:31.959
He is right.

32:34.868 --> 32:35.932
I love you.

32:35.974 --> 32:37.016
I miss you, buddy.

33:04.097 --> 33:05.151
No, it is not possible.

33:07.904 --> 33:09.895
Allahu akbar!

33:18.999 --> 33:20.042
Kathy?

33:20.281 --> 33:23.128
Do you see my daughter?

33:36.278 --> 33:38.155
Chris!
Let me in!

33:41.095 --> 33:42.138
Do you hear me?

34:19.167 --> 34:20.293
Raymie!

34:31.420 --> 34:33.150
Where is he?

34:33.161 --> 34:34.360
Everyone sit.

35:20.389 --> 35:22.329
Everyone sit down!

35:26.333 --> 35:28.325
Sit down!
Everyone sit down!

35:30.212 --> 35:31.401
Hey, what's going on?

35:31.411 --> 35:33.403
What happened?

35:37.355 --> 35:39.222
Let's go!
I want some answers.

35:39.357 --> 35:41.193
I want to see the captain!

35:41.234 --> 35:43.424
Hey, I want to see your captain.

35:44.238 --> 35:46.438
Hey, I want to see the captain!

35:46.480 --> 35:48.211
No!

35:52.257 --> 35:54.384
Attention, this is the captain.

35:54.457 --> 36:00.369
This is the captain. All passengers
take your seats immediately.

36:01.402 --> 36:03.394
Hey, back off!
I want to see the captain!

36:04.374 --> 36:05.500
Tell us what just happened?

36:15.469 --> 36:17.336
We are experiencing a
decompression.

36:17.367 --> 36:20.307
Please go to your seats,
and put on your oxygen masks.

36:29.463 --> 36:31.288
This is so crazy.

37:19.392 --> 37:20.518
Come on!

37:28.578 --> 37:30.549
Stop it!
Stop it!

37:39.569 --> 37:41.436
Stop!

37:59.414 --> 38:02.542
This is pancon 257.
We have an emergency.

38:05.420 --> 38:09.424
This is pancon 257.
We have an emergency.

38:11.458 --> 38:16.463
Mayday! Mayday! This is
pancon heavy 257. Acknowledge!

38:26.432 --> 38:28.664
Drop the pressure,
it's ok now...

38:30.405 --> 38:31.636
Everyone on this plane
is scared to death.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.608
I really need you
to step up your hand.

38:34.649 --> 38:37.475
- Can you do it?
- Yeah

38:37.517 --> 38:40.489
I'm going to say something to the
passengers, watch the flight deck.

39:04.535 --> 39:06.641
Hello. I'm captain Steele!

39:06.642 --> 39:10.097
I need you to remain in your
seats with your seat belts

39:10.109 --> 39:13.576
fastened. But you can now all
remove your oxygen masks.

39:13.722 --> 39:15.526
What's going on?

39:15.599 --> 39:18.424
My kid... where is my kid?

39:18.425 --> 39:21.491
I know you all want answers,
and believe me, so do I.

39:21.543 --> 39:24.472
And I'll do my best to get them.
But, right now...

39:24.473 --> 39:26.580
I have to do my job so that
we're all safe.

39:26.622 --> 39:28.478
Safe?
Safe from what?

39:28.519 --> 39:30.584
Sit down!

39:33.660 --> 39:36.465
Safe from our own panic.

39:36.538 --> 39:38.655
It is the biggest threat
on this plane right now...

39:38.707 --> 39:42.544
Now, I'm going to ask the flight attendants
to do a head count.

39:42.545 --> 39:45.517
Whatever happened to those people,
we will find them.

39:45.558 --> 39:49.521
I haven't been able to reach anyone yet.
So, I... I don't know if...

39:49.730 --> 39:53.120
This event was isolated
to our aircraft or others

39:53.132 --> 39:56.466
in the area have been
affected, but I promise...

39:56.476 --> 39:57.706
As soon as I have something
to tell you...

39:57.707 --> 39:58.635
I will.

39:58.677 --> 40:00.543
That's it?

40:13.745 --> 40:15.601
Raymie?

40:41.629 --> 40:43.621
Kimmy...

40:46.572 --> 40:49.710
Oh god... Kimmy...

41:02.568 --> 41:03.611
Kimmy is gone.

41:03.705 --> 41:05.571
Ray, what is happening?
Hattie...

41:05.780 --> 41:08.713
Hattie... you've gotta
pull yourself together.

41:08.726 --> 41:10.650
Just hold me... just hold me.

41:10.691 --> 41:12.714
Hattie... look at me,
look at me.

41:13.663 --> 41:16.635
We're trained for emergencies.
We're going to do our jobs.

41:16.666 --> 41:18.596
I really need to manage things here?

41:18.606 --> 41:21.797
So, I really need you to focus.
Alright?

41:21.839 --> 41:23.789
- Ok?
- Ok.

41:24.612 --> 41:25.676
Now listen...

41:25.791 --> 41:28.784
I want to go back and do full check
on the manifest.

41:29.628 --> 41:30.817
At least, find out who they are.

41:30.859 --> 41:33.768
And how many of them are
missing, right? Ok.

41:36.740 --> 41:37.710
Ray...

41:37.752 --> 41:38.836
I'm scared.

41:40.577 --> 41:41.620
Aren't you?

41:41.818 --> 41:45.625
I will be.
As soon as I have time.

42:25.740 --> 42:32.653
Please, please help me, no one knows
where my baby has gone.

42:32.654 --> 42:35.782
I'm sorry...

42:44.677 --> 42:48.807
This is Cameron Williams,
reporting from flight 257.

42:49.923 --> 42:53.864
We are somewhere over the Atlantic,
heading for London.

42:54.834 --> 42:56.575
Abbout 3 hours from jfk airport.

42:56.711 --> 43:02.770
Something impossible just took place
on this plane.

43:05.689 --> 43:07.775
Ma'am, can you tell me what you saw?

43:07.827 --> 43:09.850
I don't know.

43:09.892 --> 43:13.761
My kids gone... disappeared.

43:13.802 --> 43:15.012
Do you know when it happened?

43:15.679 --> 43:16.764
Nothing!

43:16.805 --> 43:23.771
I was sitting here, I thought maybe I was
holding it and dropping something but...

43:23.823 --> 43:28.724
Neighbour was sreaming.
I don't know.

43:44.898 --> 43:50.863
As unbelievable this may sound, people
from over this plane simply vanished.

43:52.980 --> 43:58.684
Leaving their clothes and personal
possessions and everything else...

44:11.854 --> 44:13.752
Hey!

44:14.993 --> 44:17.829
That's my brother's!

44:21.906 --> 44:23.898
No!

44:59.780 --> 45:01.011
Are you okay?

45:07.799 --> 45:11.929
Isn't it?
It can't be...

45:11.939 --> 45:13.931
This is what?

45:14.817 --> 45:16.861
No...

45:16.913 --> 45:18.978
I know what's going on here.

45:19.020 --> 45:20.949
What do you know?

45:34.953 --> 45:36.883
Okay.

45:38.989 --> 45:41.857
It's a bad trip.

45:42.931 --> 45:44.954
You must move on.

45:45.871 --> 45:48.843
It's not going to last forever.

45:54.057 --> 45:57.895
Hello?
Can anyone hear me?

46:18.041 --> 46:20.064
Hey, hey.

46:20.106 --> 46:22.014
It's alright.

46:22.911 --> 46:25.007
Let's go back to your seat.

46:29.887 --> 46:31.952
Buckle in... alright.

46:34.934 --> 46:38.042
You're safe.
But you knew what happened.

46:42.046 --> 46:45.028
None of this is happening.

46:45.925 --> 46:49.022
That's okay,
we'll going to get through this.

46:51.066 --> 46:53.162
Alright...
None of this is happening.

46:54.945 --> 46:59.012
Why don't you relax, ok?
Sit back and relax.

46:59.951 --> 47:02.078
Try get some sleep.

47:06.134 --> 47:08.157
Can you tell me what you saw?

47:08.209 --> 47:12.902
It was the same thing you did. Doesn't
look any different from down here.

47:12.912 --> 47:14.977
Oh, come on...

47:15.081 --> 47:21.046
Anything strange before the people
vanished? Flash or sound... anything.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.903
No.

47:24.101 --> 47:26.030
What about there?

47:26.031 --> 47:28.012
Who was that?

47:28.179 --> 47:31.045
I do not know, some guy!

47:31.046 --> 47:34.112
Anything unusual about that guy?

47:34.227 --> 47:38.961
Look, pal, there's something
unusual about all of us here.

47:39.097 --> 47:41.975
Get that thing off my face.

47:52.966 --> 47:57.053
Hi, this is the Steele's household.
Please leave your name and number.

47:57.168 --> 47:58.930
Mom...

47:58.972 --> 48:02.101
Mom, please pick up the phone.
I do not know what's going on.

48:04.238 --> 48:09.087
Raymie, if you went home and
you can hear me right now.

48:09.129 --> 48:11.183
I need you to listen, ok?

48:11.225 --> 48:14.166
I know that you are scared
and I'm too scared.

48:14.207 --> 48:17.032
But I really need you
to pick up the phone.

48:17.033 --> 48:19.974
Need you to let me know
that you're okay.

48:20.005 --> 48:22.174
I need to hear your voice.

48:26.158 --> 48:28.994
I love you guys.

48:47.232 --> 48:50.965
I think, we should all be
doing right now...

48:51.007 --> 48:52.175
Is saying a prayer.

48:52.206 --> 48:54.188
A prayer?

48:57.055 --> 48:59.078
A prayer to who?

48:59.224 --> 49:01.164
To god.

49:01.258 --> 49:03.249
Whose god?

49:04.104 --> 49:06.169
Yours or mine?

49:06.200 --> 49:08.192
Just Allah.

49:11.049 --> 49:13.072
You know what I think?

49:13.083 --> 49:15.054
No.

49:16.023 --> 49:17.575
Attention passengers...
since we haven't reached

49:17.588 --> 49:19.120
the halfway point I'm
turning back to New York.

49:19.173 --> 49:22.228
We'll be over jfk inside of 3 hours.

49:46.212 --> 49:50.091
Raymie!
Raymie - back off.

49:57.172 --> 50:00.144
Hi, this is Irene Steele...

50:07.255 --> 50:09.195
You okay?

50:10.227 --> 50:12.136
Did you do the count?

50:12.167 --> 50:15.233
I tried. But many of them are
not in their seats.

50:15.243 --> 50:19.049
Maybe they're not there at all.
They're scared, ray.

50:19.091 --> 50:21.051
We're all scared.

50:21.124 --> 50:26.224
Well, let's hope whatever it was
doesn't happen again.

50:26.265 --> 50:28.236
What is that?

50:29.268 --> 50:34.232
Charlie 1581, this is pancon
257, do you copy?

50:35.254 --> 50:40.186
Charlie 1581, we have an emergency
situation. Repeat, we have an...

51:03.201 --> 51:06.339
You are approaching our flight path!
Get out there and prep the cabin!

51:06.412 --> 51:08.342
Now!

51:14.358 --> 51:19.395
All passengers, take your seats
and put seat belts on immediately!

51:29.354 --> 51:33.424
Charlie 1581, you're in our airspace.
I'm climbing

51:33.436 --> 51:37.279
1,000 feet. That is one,
zero, zero, zero feet.

52:15.288 --> 52:16.477
Damn!

52:17.311 --> 52:18.417
Mayday!

52:18.458 --> 52:21.284
This is pancon 257.

52:21.326 --> 52:24.298
We have been involved in a collision.

52:24.360 --> 52:27.331
Charlie 1581 is down.

52:27.332 --> 52:29.470
Our coordinates are...

52:31.451 --> 52:38.261
4-7...
This is an emergency situation.

52:42.474 --> 52:45.341
We have a plane down,
it's search and rescue...

52:45.373 --> 52:49.273
Repeat, this is an emergency.

52:50.493 --> 52:54.393
Come on, there has to be
someone out there.

54:13.383 --> 54:15.375
What is wrong with you?

54:15.427 --> 54:19.557
You really believe a group of terrorists
could develop a bomb like this?

54:20.568 --> 54:22.529
We are not talking about
a car bomb.

54:22.539 --> 54:25.469
If this was a weapon,
it is not from this planet.

54:25.542 --> 54:27.409
What exactly are you saying?

54:27.419 --> 54:30.433
I'm just saying,
maybe they were abducted.

54:30.485 --> 54:32.477
Aliens?

54:32.592 --> 54:34.521
Come on.

54:34.562 --> 54:36.627
Can you believe this guy?

55:11.466 --> 55:12.634
Is everything okay?

55:12.666 --> 55:14.428
That other plane,
did it lose people?

55:14.470 --> 55:15.638
I don't know.

55:18.641 --> 55:23.417
Your camera, I need you to take
a picture of the wing for the captain.

55:50.404 --> 55:51.572
Raymie!

55:52.552 --> 55:54.481
Raymie!

57:03.524 --> 57:05.516
Be careful.

57:10.667 --> 57:12.637
Okay.

57:12.638 --> 57:14.577
Here's what I can get.

57:14.609 --> 57:16.579
Looks like we came about...

57:16.580 --> 57:18.780
6 inches from losing a wing.

57:18.790 --> 57:20.761
And the spoiler is gone.

57:20.792 --> 57:22.732
What does that mean?

57:22.763 --> 57:26.559
It's just gonna be a lot tougher
to slow down when we get home.

57:26.569 --> 57:30.668
One thing the runway at jfk is long enough.
Good thing we didn't hit the tail.

57:31.606 --> 57:34.609
I guess it's our lucky day.

58:18.771 --> 58:21.608
They're all gone.

58:23.756 --> 58:27.781
Not just the babies.
The older kids too.

58:28.698 --> 58:30.690
Are you sure?

58:30.701 --> 58:33.631
I'm looking for my brother.

58:33.766 --> 58:37.802
I heard some doctors
talking a while ago.

58:39.742 --> 58:41.838
This is not just here.

58:41.890 --> 58:44.882
It's everywhere.

58:44.893 --> 58:47.865
All over the world.

58:49.669 --> 58:54.612
They say no one has seen a single kid
since it happened.

59:01.723 --> 59:05.665
We either damaged some
of our computer sensors or...

59:05.707 --> 59:09.691
Cameron, I lost the auto-pilot
can you go to the very back

59:09.704 --> 59:13.768
and see there's anything liquid
spilling out from the wing?

59:13.778 --> 59:15.811
Liquid?

59:15.853 --> 59:17.719
You mean fuel?

59:17.720 --> 59:22.715
I want to take us up to a few thousand
feet, enter a small range, just in case.

59:34.821 --> 59:36.886
Perfect.

59:48.711 --> 59:50.682
We have to go back.
We have to go back.

59:50.724 --> 59:53.313
We are going back. We're only
just a few... no, I mean,

59:53.326 --> 59:55.926
back to where they disappeared.
I need to find my baby.

59:55.927 --> 59:58.878
We are losing fuel. We have a little left.
We're not gonna have enough to get home.

59:58.910 --> 01:00:04.645
What? We can't get home?! We have
fuel reserves. We'll gonna be fine.

01:00:09.963 --> 01:00:12.799
Are we on fire?!

01:00:15.844 --> 01:00:17.814
We have the right to know
if we're going to die, ok?!

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:19.880
No one is going to die!

01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:22.716
Hey, everyone, listen up!

01:00:22.748 --> 01:00:26.710
No one is going to die, you hear me?
Everyone sit down, everyone sit!

01:00:26.731 --> 01:00:28.785
Now, captain's right.

01:00:28.869 --> 01:00:32.967
As hard as it may be,
we all need to stay calm.

01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:06.001
- We're on fire.
- Where?

01:01:06.002 --> 01:01:06.900
The wing on this side.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:08.734
Is the wing on fire or
is the spray on fire?

01:01:08.776 --> 01:01:10.872
The spray. It's big.

01:01:11.946 --> 01:01:13.980
We'll fly afront of it.
It'll burn off.

01:01:14.021 --> 01:01:18.766
- But?
- It's fuel.

01:01:18.797 --> 01:01:19.996
Fuel that we need to hang on.

01:01:20.007 --> 01:01:23.937
Are you still going to get us back?
Well, that depends.

01:01:23.938 --> 01:01:28.818
If the leak is here or here.

01:01:30.059 --> 01:01:31.883
So what do we do?

01:01:31.884 --> 01:01:35.805
Let it burn. See what is left.

01:02:01.948 --> 01:02:03.939
Fire is out.

01:02:04.794 --> 01:02:06.817
Levels haven't change.

01:02:06.859 --> 01:02:09.925
Does it mean we'll empty?
Means we don't know.

01:02:10.905 --> 01:02:13.814
And we've lost the elevators.
The what?

01:02:13.835 --> 01:02:20.843
The elevators. Can't climb. Looks like we
begun our decend at New York 2 hours early.

01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:26.828
Can't believe we can't reach anyone.

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:28.862
You have a satellite phone?

01:02:28.872 --> 01:02:30.864
Investigative journalist.

01:02:31.073 --> 01:02:33.909
Pilot.

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:37.924
Yes, the only other plane was
the one that nearly hit us.

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:40.989
Did you talk to them?
Did they lose any passengers?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.054
I don't know about passengers.

01:02:43.065 --> 01:02:45.870
But I do know this.

01:02:46.839 --> 01:02:50.041
There wasn't anyone
flying that plane.

01:03:38.009 --> 01:03:40.949
Excuse me. I was just thinking...

01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:45.048
What if they are still here?

01:03:45.996 --> 01:03:47.894
What?

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:50.898
I mean...

01:03:51.106 --> 01:03:53.035
What if we just cannot see them?

01:03:53.067 --> 01:03:57.102
Like, you know,
if they're invisible.

01:03:58.958 --> 01:04:00.074
Jeez wheez.

01:04:00.116 --> 01:04:03.922
Isn't invisible any crazier
than vanished?

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:07.021
Hello, this is to restore alarm.
We have detected an alarm at your premise.

01:05:07.052 --> 01:05:10.087
Due to unusual call volume...

01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:22.120
(Pray)

01:05:53.247 --> 01:05:55.010
What do you know about Kimmy?

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:56.176
What?

01:05:56.178 --> 01:05:58.055
How well did you know her?

01:05:58.096 --> 01:06:01.067
Not very. She's just a friend.

01:06:01.068 --> 01:06:03.091
Go through her stuff.
What stuff?

01:06:03.102 --> 01:06:05.607
Anything. Her purse, her
jacket, her ID badge.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.138
Just go get her things
and bring them in here.

01:06:08.243 --> 01:06:10.266
Please - ok.

01:08:03.272 --> 01:08:06.140
We have another aircraft in our area.

01:08:06.181 --> 01:08:10.601
Please fasten your seat belts,
Charlie 1581 you're in our airspace.

01:08:10.613 --> 01:08:14.524
We are climbing 1,000 feet that
is one, zero, zero, zero...

01:09:17.247 --> 01:09:22.357
Dump the purse. Dump the purse.
Come on, just...

01:09:24.234 --> 01:09:26.403
What are you looking for?

01:09:46.381 --> 01:09:51.252
Either I'm going crazy, or the
world is going insane.

01:09:51.283 --> 01:09:54.255
What are you talking about?

01:09:58.437 --> 01:10:01.461
I think I know where they are.

01:10:06.425 --> 01:10:08.541
What if we are now where
we think we are or even went?

01:10:08.552 --> 01:10:10.252
What do you mean?

01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:12.389
If we passed through a wormhole.
A wrinkle in the space time fabric.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.713
Theoretically, we
could be in different

01:10:14.725 --> 01:10:17.457
dimension with those
people who don't exist...

01:10:17.499 --> 01:10:19.272
Or they never exist?

01:10:19.313 --> 01:10:20.304
That is insane!

01:10:20.315 --> 01:10:23.443
Stop it! That's enough!
All of you!

01:10:24.423 --> 01:10:25.591
I know what's going on here.

01:10:26.425 --> 01:10:27.395
You do?

01:10:27.426 --> 01:10:29.366
How much did they pay you?

01:10:29.595 --> 01:10:31.399
What are you talking about?

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:34.371
I can't believe he
do this, she's her daughter!

01:10:34.413 --> 01:10:36.467
Ok. Miss, I don't know
what's going on here...

01:10:37.583 --> 01:10:39.439
Get up!

01:10:43.423 --> 01:10:44.549
Where did you get that?

01:10:44.559 --> 01:10:46.498
- You!
- Yes...

01:10:46.499 --> 01:10:48.563
How much did they pay you?
What?

01:10:48.605 --> 01:10:52.380
Where did they take her?!
Please! What are you talking about?

01:10:52.411 --> 01:10:54.570
- My husband...
- Miss, please!

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.551
Shut, just shut up!

01:10:57.354 --> 01:11:00.347
Ma'am, who's your husband?
Just tell us that.

01:11:01.421 --> 01:11:03.486
Why are you doing this?
Listen to me...

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.499
I promise you, I've never
met your husband...

01:11:07.438 --> 01:11:09.377
What is wrong with this?

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.609
Ma'am look,
I do not know what this is...

01:11:12.516 --> 01:11:15.321
But... what don't I just
shoot you in the face?

01:11:15.363 --> 01:11:16.406
No!

01:11:16.458 --> 01:11:20.597
Ray, what happened to you?

01:11:20.598 --> 01:11:22.569
Why are you talking like this?

01:11:23.538 --> 01:11:26.437
You've never spoken
about god before.

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:28.481
Where is this coming from?

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.515
From...

01:11:32.392 --> 01:11:33.549
My wife.

01:11:57.366 --> 01:11:58.461
Miss, please!

01:11:58.576 --> 01:12:00.474
Forget about him, ok?

01:12:00.547 --> 01:12:02.413
He's an idiot.

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:04.582
He's not a part of anything.
Point that gun at me.

01:12:08.535 --> 01:12:09.692
I'm an idiot?

01:12:10.464 --> 01:12:11.506
What about her?

01:12:11.663 --> 01:12:14.572
Miss, please!
Point the gun at me!

01:12:16.543 --> 01:12:17.586
Here you go.

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:20.516
Good.

01:12:20.558 --> 01:12:24.489
Now, just tell me what you think
is going on?

01:12:24.562 --> 01:12:26.460
He is trying to take her from me.

01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:30.589
He think he can buy his way
out of anything.

01:12:30.704 --> 01:12:33.436
He took my daughter,
and that ring.

01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:35.605
I fell asleep...

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:41.445
Somebody put something in my drink.
I should have known he will find a way.

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:45.532
He could not have done this.

01:12:45.637 --> 01:12:46.680
There's no way.

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:51.570
This plane landed while
I was sleeping.

01:12:51.643 --> 01:12:54.521
He took her! He paid all of you
to lie to me.

01:12:55.585 --> 01:12:57.566
I can't lose her again.
I can't...

01:12:57.587 --> 01:12:59.464
You need to listen to me.

01:13:00.538 --> 01:13:02.436
I was awake all the time.

01:13:03.437 --> 01:13:04.595
This plane never landed.

01:13:04.741 --> 01:13:07.566
No one got off this plane.

01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:09.610
Then where is she?

01:13:12.624 --> 01:13:16.461
I can't lose her, I
can't, she's all I have!

01:13:17.702 --> 01:13:21.602
You're all think I'm crazy,
what am I supposed to say?

01:13:21.675 --> 01:13:23.646
That she just disappeared?

01:13:24.512 --> 01:13:25.711
I know where she is.

01:13:56.536 --> 01:13:57.672
Pastor Barnes?

01:13:58.715 --> 01:13:59.758
Chloe...

01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:02.573
- Hey...
- Oh, no...

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.721
Oh, thank god you're still here.

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:09.768
My mom and raymie, when I saw that they
had gone, I was sacred that god had...

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:14.711
He did. Chloe, just like he
promised, a blink of an eye.

01:14:15.754 --> 01:14:17.506
What?

01:14:17.548 --> 01:14:18.643
It's true...

01:14:20.551 --> 01:14:21.781
Then why are you still here?

01:14:27.642 --> 01:14:29.571
It is in the Bible.

01:14:29.644 --> 01:14:32.543
My parents sent me to
camp on summer, and...

01:14:32.585 --> 01:14:34.576
Everyone was talking about this.

01:14:34.816 --> 01:14:41.521
They say that one day millions of
people will going to just disappear.

01:14:41.563 --> 01:14:42.606
Millions?

01:14:42.762 --> 01:14:44.638
What else did they say?

01:14:44.639 --> 01:14:46.537
I do not remember.

01:14:46.777 --> 01:14:48.643
It was a long time ago.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:51.553
Are you saying it was the devil?

01:14:51.751 --> 01:14:52.794
No.

01:14:52.825 --> 01:14:54.692
It was god.

01:14:56.631 --> 01:14:58.602
Don't tell me you believe this.

01:14:58.633 --> 01:15:00.698
It does not matter what I believe.

01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:02.794
Where are they?
Where did they go?

01:15:02.804 --> 01:15:04.577
To heaven.

01:15:10.594 --> 01:15:11.752
Pk was right.

01:15:11.825 --> 01:15:13.702
What do you mean?

01:15:14.796 --> 01:15:16.767
Maybe I am really crazy.

01:15:16.799 --> 01:15:18.676
No, you're not.

01:15:19.708 --> 01:15:22.690
She's better off without me.
Don't say that.

01:15:24.619 --> 01:15:25.652
No, no!
Please don't!

01:15:25.662 --> 01:15:26.705
Please, do not!

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:29.760
Maybe, the world is better off
without me.

01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:32.732
You need to listen to me now,
do not do this.

01:15:33.765 --> 01:15:35.642
You can't just give up on her.

01:15:37.842 --> 01:15:40.616
Do you have children,
Mr. Williams?

01:15:40.814 --> 01:15:42.587
No, I don't.

01:15:43.859 --> 01:15:45.788
But I did have a mom.

01:15:46.664 --> 01:15:50.626
She was sick. My daddy tried everything...
Doctors, pills...

01:15:50.731 --> 01:15:52.702
But in the end,
it didn't matter.

01:15:52.879 --> 01:15:54.777
I came home from school one day.

01:15:55.924 --> 01:15:57.748
And I found her.

01:15:57.749 --> 01:15:59.688
She was lying there.

01:15:59.793 --> 01:16:03.755
Still. Don't you do that to Katie.

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:10.876
We may not know what happened here today
but it is not Katie's fault...

01:16:10.877 --> 01:16:12.608
Do you hear me?

01:16:12.681 --> 01:16:13.808
Yes.

01:16:14.746 --> 01:16:16.884
But she's somewhere out there,
right now...

01:16:17.603 --> 01:16:18.729
Watching us.

01:16:25.779 --> 01:16:27.614
Yeah, that's good.

01:16:27.624 --> 01:16:28.667
Give me that.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:44.809
Hattie, this isn't about us.

01:16:45.748 --> 01:16:47.646
It's about the truth.

01:16:47.854 --> 01:16:49.721
You need to focus on the truth.

01:16:50.753 --> 01:16:51.890
That truth, ray?

01:16:52.766 --> 01:16:54.789
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

01:16:54.831 --> 01:16:57.803
This isn't about our past,
it's about right now.

01:16:57.896 --> 01:17:00.670
What's happening on this plane
right now.

01:17:00.879 --> 01:17:03.746
This could be happening everywhere,
right now.

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:07.855
So they are all in heaven.
That is your conclusions.

01:17:07.865 --> 01:17:10.763
Without speaking to anyone
outside of this plane.

01:17:10.764 --> 01:17:13.736
You're gonna jump to the first explanation
that pops into your head.

01:17:13.768 --> 01:17:15.738
I already knew this was coming.

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.773
In details.

01:17:18.783 --> 01:17:19.941
How can that be possible?

01:17:20.911 --> 01:17:24.863
The way it happened,
the way they disappeared...

01:17:25.864 --> 01:17:28.919
Even the way their clothes
were still there.

01:17:28.971 --> 01:17:30.807
Perfect details.

01:17:31.902 --> 01:17:33.779
How could she know that?

01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:34.967
Think about it.

01:17:35.979 --> 01:17:37.918
Why don't you think about this?

01:17:38.951 --> 01:17:41.850
You lied to me about your wife.

01:17:42.767 --> 01:17:44.790
You lied to your wife
about this trip.

01:17:44.863 --> 01:17:46.855
You even lied to your
own daughter.

01:17:47.043 --> 01:17:50.869
It seems that you're able to lie to
just about everybody in your life.

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:53.790
And now you're asking me
to find god.

01:17:54.885 --> 01:17:55.927
Hattie.

01:18:06.877 --> 01:18:07.971
I don't understand.

01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:10.902
You were here every day.

01:18:10.912 --> 01:18:12.946
You worked here,
you preached here.

01:18:12.987 --> 01:18:14.791
That's not what counted.

01:18:14.958 --> 01:18:16.022
What do you mean?

01:18:16.032 --> 01:18:18.620
I knew all the words, I
could quote the chapters

01:18:18.633 --> 01:18:20.808
and the verses, but
that was not enough.

01:18:20.871 --> 01:18:22.737
You have to believe.

01:18:23.843 --> 01:18:24.885
Believe?

01:18:25.011 --> 01:18:26.877
Believe in what?

01:18:27.847 --> 01:18:29.985
In a god that killed my father?

01:18:30.026 --> 01:18:33.997
A god that grabbed my mother and
my brother and raised them out

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:37.868
of this world. A god that crashes
planes and destroys cities?

01:18:37.899 --> 01:18:39.807
He took them to protect them.

01:18:39.808 --> 01:18:40.903
From what?

01:18:40.944 --> 01:18:43.812
From the darkest time in
the history of this world.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.012
Persecution, war...

01:18:46.085 --> 01:18:49.797
In 7 years of darkness,
he took them to heaven.

01:18:50.965 --> 01:18:52.936
And what about the rest of us?

01:18:53.937 --> 01:18:56.774
What about me?
What am I supposed to do?

01:18:56.805 --> 01:18:58.878
It is not about what we
do, it's about asking for

01:18:58.891 --> 01:19:00.976
forgiveness, it's about
turning our lives over...

01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:02.029
Stop it!

01:19:02.926 --> 01:19:07.858
The god that my mother talked about,
would never do something like this.

01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:09.975
Chloe, please...

01:19:10.069 --> 01:19:11.831
Listen to me.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.834
Listen to you?

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.784
Why should I?

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:18.015
You didn't even listen to you.

01:19:37.922 --> 01:19:39.121
Are you okay marshal?

01:19:39.966 --> 01:19:41.009
Yeah.

01:19:42.906 --> 01:19:44.063
Heard all about you.

01:19:44.064 --> 01:19:47.005
Peacon 257. This is dispatch.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.872
This is pancon 257,
calling dispatch.

01:19:49.883 --> 01:19:52.948
Pancon 257, this is
Marcus, are you there?

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:57.964
Marcus, I'm 20 minutes outside of jfk.
I had to turn around.

01:19:57.995 --> 01:19:59.831
How many did you lose?

01:20:02.146 --> 01:20:04.137
So, it is everywhere.

01:20:04.148 --> 01:20:05.910
The whole planet, buddy.

01:20:08.017 --> 01:20:10.989
No one knows how many,
but millions.

01:20:12.928 --> 01:20:14.127
What about my family?

01:20:15.066 --> 01:20:17.995
I need you to call Irene,
make sure they are safe.

01:20:17.996 --> 01:20:18.976
How's your fuel?

01:20:19.008 --> 01:20:21.104
Critical. I would be lucky to reach
the coast without ditching in.

01:20:21.114 --> 01:20:24.044
Listen, there are planes
down everywhere, the runway

01:20:24.057 --> 01:20:27.110
is full of birds, there's no
way you can get into jfk.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.893
What about laguardia?

01:20:28.935 --> 01:20:30.092
I'm sorry, ray.

01:20:30.895 --> 01:20:31.959
So, where am I going?

01:20:31.969 --> 01:20:33.137
You gonna have to go inland.

01:20:33.972 --> 01:20:35.995
Marcus, I can't go inland!

01:20:36.036 --> 01:20:39.102
You need to tell me
when you're ready.

01:20:39.112 --> 01:20:41.102
Circuit is impossible, you
have to talk to them.

01:20:41.115 --> 01:20:43.117
They have to gonna clear
things up for us there.

01:20:44.191 --> 01:20:45.922
Marcus?

01:20:46.933 --> 01:20:47.976
Marcus!

01:20:51.939 --> 01:20:55.245
Jfk tower, this pancon
257, I have a low-fuel

01:20:55.258 --> 01:20:59.082
emergency. I need a runway.
Repeat. I need a runway.

01:21:39.271 --> 01:21:41.064
So...

01:21:41.387 --> 01:21:43.296
Is there a backup plan?

01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:46.236
I'm gonna level with you.

01:21:47.279 --> 01:21:51.106
We're not just a low on fuel,
we're low on fumes.

01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:55.152
Jfk was the closest airport, and I
would love to have made it that far.

01:21:55.319 --> 01:21:57.227
We only have one option.

01:21:57.259 --> 01:22:00.231
I hope they clear us a runway
and hope that they do it soon.

01:22:00.272 --> 01:22:03.201
What about the water?
Can't raise the nose.

01:22:03.202 --> 01:22:06.237
When we hit the water,
this thing is going to disintegrate.

01:22:09.188 --> 01:22:12.902
Can't. I can't let the people
back there go down without

01:22:12.915 --> 01:22:16.185
having any chance to undo
some of their mistakes.

01:22:17.363 --> 01:22:18.406
Hey...

01:22:20.169 --> 01:22:24.173
You are venice Baxter, aren't you?
Tom's daughter.

01:22:26.185 --> 01:22:28.250
You probably do not remember me,
we...

01:22:28.281 --> 01:22:35.362
Met once at your father's office. You were
sitting right by this little yellow desk.

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:42.182
I remember thinking, this guy's place,
decorated with the best of everything...

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.445
But he's got this plastic little desk.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:50.232
Sitting beside him like it's the
finest piece of furniture in the room.

01:22:51.327 --> 01:22:54.268
Sometimes that's the only way
I got to see him.

01:22:55.477 --> 01:22:57.208
Well...

01:22:58.251 --> 01:23:00.222
At least he was trying.

01:23:00.389 --> 01:23:02.318
And I have a little girl too.

01:23:03.496 --> 01:23:07.229
I mean, she was little.
She's married now.

01:23:08.199 --> 01:23:10.170
She never had
a desk in my office.

01:23:10.212 --> 01:23:12.256
The truth is... I was so busy.

01:23:13.507 --> 01:23:15.373
I hardly ever saw her though.

01:23:17.282 --> 01:23:20.779
You know, when all these
people disappeared,

01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:23.288
I never even thought about her.

01:23:24.435 --> 01:23:27.256
I wish I could say I
did, but I was always

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:30.233
thinking about money,
about opportunities...

01:23:31.349 --> 01:23:33.215
Making my next meal.

01:23:37.428 --> 01:23:38.471
I'm sorry...

01:23:39.493 --> 01:23:42.434
You know what you said
about heaven?

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:46.563
As much as I want to see her...

01:23:48.451 --> 01:23:51.506
When I get home,
I hope she's not there.

01:24:15.302 --> 01:24:18.535
I need you try and
call Chloe for me.

01:24:19.411 --> 01:24:21.444
I've been trying.

01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:24.622
The truth is... uh...
I've not stopped

01:24:24.634 --> 01:24:27.315
thinking about her since
I got on the plane.

01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:30.516
I can understand that.

01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:38.275
Jfk tower, do you hear me?

01:24:38.379 --> 01:24:41.319
We are headed for the coast.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.353
Our fuel is at critical.

01:24:43.395 --> 01:24:44.552
I need a clear runway.

01:24:44.594 --> 01:24:48.494
I repeat, I need a clear runway.

01:24:49.297 --> 01:24:50.423
Listen to me...

01:24:50.507 --> 01:24:52.372
I have a plane full of people here.

01:24:52.373 --> 01:24:54.427
I have no spoilers, no flaps,
no elevators and...

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.565
And if I run this thing right,
no reverse thrust...

01:24:56.617 --> 01:24:59.558
I need some room!

01:25:28.443 --> 01:25:30.383
Oh...

01:25:34.491 --> 01:25:36.462
Were you with her...

01:25:36.493 --> 01:25:39.330
When she got the concert tickets?

01:25:39.538 --> 01:25:42.562
I was... what can I say...

01:25:42.614 --> 01:25:44.544
She was hurt.

01:25:46.483 --> 01:25:49.413
I should never have
left her today.

01:25:49.518 --> 01:25:50.508
You didn't know.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:53.626
All I knew she came home
and see me and I left.

01:25:53.658 --> 01:25:56.536
I left her alone.

01:25:56.609 --> 01:26:00.477
God only knows what she's
been going through down there.

01:26:00.509 --> 01:26:04.575
She loves you, ray?
She will understand.

01:26:10.571 --> 01:26:14.524
I can't let that be the last thing
we said to each other.

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:20.478
I just... I can't.

01:26:21.448 --> 01:26:23.512
I need to tell her the truth.

01:26:23.565 --> 01:26:28.466
And I need her to know that this wasn't
her mother's fault. It's all mine.

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:35.577
Every time that Irene mentioned god,
I walked away.

01:27:37.675 --> 01:27:39.542
Mom...

01:27:40.710 --> 01:27:44.516
I don't know if you can hear me...

01:27:44.724 --> 01:27:48.489
But I just wanted to say...

01:27:49.552 --> 01:27:53.734
This morning, I felt like
our family was falling apart.

01:27:53.776 --> 01:27:56.529
And I blamed you.

01:27:56.612 --> 01:28:00.679
And I know that I hurt you.

01:28:01.544 --> 01:28:03.682
And I'm sorry.

01:28:04.662 --> 01:28:07.520
I'm so sorry.

01:28:25.737 --> 01:28:27.531
Hello?

01:28:27.572 --> 01:28:29.741
- Who is this?
- Chloe...

01:28:29.773 --> 01:28:31.754
- This is buck.
- Buck?

01:28:33.547 --> 01:28:35.748
Thank god, you're alive.

01:28:35.821 --> 01:28:37.583
Where is my dad?

01:28:37.625 --> 01:28:39.616
He is here.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:42.588
Chloe, are you okay?

01:28:42.599 --> 01:28:43.798
Dad...

01:28:44.538 --> 01:28:45.738
I thought you were dead.

01:28:45.769 --> 01:28:47.802
Are you okay?

01:28:49.721 --> 01:28:53.548
Yeah... I guess so.

01:28:53.725 --> 01:28:59.596
But mom and raymie,
they are both gone.

01:29:04.779 --> 01:29:06.802
Mom told me about this.

01:29:06.854 --> 01:29:09.690
I know, she told me too.

01:29:09.722 --> 01:29:12.589
I love you so much, sweetheart.

01:29:12.694 --> 01:29:15.665
I love you more than anything
in the world.

01:29:15.728 --> 01:29:18.763
Me too daddy, me too...

01:29:18.773 --> 01:29:21.839
I'm so sorry I lied to you and
I wasn't there with you today.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.582
I really, really need you to know
how much I love you.

01:29:25.624 --> 01:29:26.782
No matter what happens.

01:29:26.823 --> 01:29:30.723
Wait, dad... why
are you talking like this?

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.724
What's going on?
Where are you?

01:29:32.725 --> 01:29:37.699
Well... we still are in the air. We're
on our way home, but there is a problem.

01:29:37.741 --> 01:29:41.704
The airports are closed, the roads are
jammed and there's no way to land...

01:29:41.714 --> 01:29:42.694
What?

01:29:42.715 --> 01:29:45.698
And I do not have enough fuel.

01:29:45.718 --> 01:29:47.689
Chloe...

01:29:47.898 --> 01:29:49.796
Dad...

01:29:50.734 --> 01:29:52.643
Chloe...

01:30:47.858 --> 01:30:49.850
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:30:50.653 --> 01:30:51.914
We are coming in on New York.

01:30:51.956 --> 01:30:53.833
Alright...

01:30:55.835 --> 01:30:58.776
However, we still have challenges ahead.
All the airports are closed.

01:30:58.838 --> 01:31:01.873
I need you to remain in your seats...

01:31:01.904 --> 01:31:06.857
With your seat belts fastened,
and try to remain calm.

01:31:06.889 --> 01:31:09.829
But I have to be honest...

01:31:10.768 --> 01:31:13.667
This is a very serious situation.

01:31:13.698 --> 01:31:18.766
We're talking to the ground, we'll try
to find an alternate landing sites.

01:31:18.818 --> 01:31:21.874
But we are very low on fuel.

01:31:23.761 --> 01:31:27.755
Please pay very close attention
to our flight crew.

01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:30.768
And if you believe in prayer...

01:31:32.739 --> 01:31:34.835
Now would be the time.

01:31:38.819 --> 01:31:39.809
Will you pray with me?

01:31:39.862 --> 01:31:42.833
Yes, of course. Yeah.

01:31:58.757 --> 01:31:59.727
Nothing.

01:31:59.758 --> 01:32:00.821
Still can't get signal.

01:32:00.894 --> 01:32:01.958
Keep trying.

01:32:01.969 --> 01:32:03.866
I will.

01:32:04.044 --> 01:32:06.870
Well, we'll gonna have to
put it down.

01:32:06.974 --> 01:32:08.945
Put it down?

01:32:08.976 --> 01:32:10.916
- Where?
- Water...

01:32:10.947 --> 01:32:11.875
But you said...

01:32:11.885 --> 01:32:13.752
I know...

01:32:13.825 --> 01:32:18.789
I wait on jfk as long as I can, but
I can't fly there without a clear runway.

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:21.135
There's nothing but sitting on
every side of the airport.

01:32:21.771 --> 01:32:24.826
By flying in,
there's nowhere to land.

01:32:24.878 --> 01:32:28.904
We're flying a 400-tonne
missile right into queens.

01:32:57.914 --> 01:33:01.981
Jfk tower, this is pancon 257, we need
emergency clearance immediately.

01:33:02.022 --> 01:33:04.848
Get her back!
Keep trying.

01:33:18.884 --> 01:33:23.879
Ok folks, I need your full attention
as we go through the emergency procedures.

01:33:23.931 --> 01:33:28.013
Underneath your seats, you will find your
life jackets. You must keep your seat

01:33:28.025 --> 01:33:32.274
belts tightly fastened across your waists
until the plane come to a complete stop.

01:33:36.883 --> 01:33:39.886
Then you must follow all
flight crew's instructions.

01:33:39.896 --> 01:33:44.026
Jfk tower, this is pancon 257, we need
emergency clearance right now.

01:33:44.067 --> 01:33:50.063
Jfk tower. Jfk tower, this is pancon 257,
we need clearance now!

01:34:03.912 --> 01:34:05.841
Come on...

01:34:19.939 --> 01:34:21.879
Ok.

01:34:26.926 --> 01:34:28.010
Buck, can you hear me?

01:34:28.052 --> 01:34:28.980
Chloe.

01:34:29.022 --> 01:34:31.055
Turn on the speakers.

01:34:32.974 --> 01:34:35.028
I think I found a place for
you guys to land.

01:34:35.101 --> 01:34:37.729
The new east-west highway
near the mall. No one's

01:34:37.742 --> 01:34:40.012
out here.
I think I can clear enough room.

01:34:40.013 --> 01:34:42.985
Our guidance system is out. I won't be able
to find it in the dark.

01:34:43.016 --> 01:34:47.052
Hey, Chloe, your phone...
You should open up the compass app.

01:34:47.093 --> 01:34:49.930
Ok, hang on.

01:34:51.911 --> 01:34:52.954
Ok, I've got it.

01:34:52.964 --> 01:34:57.177
Well, you see the bottom, those little
numbers? I need you to read those to me.

01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:05.947
40.66.34 north 73.78.32 west

01:35:05.999 --> 01:35:07.042
I got it.

01:35:07.063 --> 01:35:09.001
Chloe, how much room we've got?

01:35:09.002 --> 01:35:10.170
Uh... about half a mile away.

01:35:10.201 --> 01:35:11.140
And there's more...

01:35:11.182 --> 01:35:14.079
How much more?
I need at least a mile.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.072
Okay, hang on.

01:35:43.039 --> 01:35:45.979
Chloe... Chloe, are you still there?

01:35:50.015 --> 01:35:52.017
Abbout seven-tenth.

01:35:52.059 --> 01:35:54.050
Eight-tenth...

01:35:54.092 --> 01:35:57.127
Buck... buck, can you hear me?

01:35:58.034 --> 01:36:00.005
Hello?

01:36:11.027 --> 01:36:12.257
Come on.

01:36:17.169 --> 01:36:19.202
You've got to be kidding me.

01:36:20.214 --> 01:36:22.185
Come on!

01:36:27.159 --> 01:36:32.039
We need a visual of some kind, so we
can see where the landing zone begins.

01:36:44.083 --> 01:36:48.202
How are you? You mind if I sit down
here for a moment? Yes... yes...

01:36:48.233 --> 01:36:53.082
Just until your husband
comes back from the bathroom.

01:37:06.273 --> 01:37:07.264
We ran out of fuel!

01:37:07.306 --> 01:37:09.204
What?

01:37:09.214 --> 01:37:10.267
No.

01:37:10.319 --> 01:37:13.291
We can still land it.
We can glide it down.

01:37:13.323 --> 01:37:16.210
But we're going to hit
the ground fast. I've

01:37:16.223 --> 01:37:19.058
no thrust to slow it
down, just the brakes.

01:37:19.089 --> 01:37:22.040
We're going to need
every inch of the gas.

01:37:29.183 --> 01:37:30.112
Dad...

01:37:30.153 --> 01:37:31.144
Chloe...

01:37:31.154 --> 01:37:32.145
Go ahead...

01:37:32.187 --> 01:37:34.518
I'm out of road. I'm at
nine-tenth of a mile but

01:37:34.531 --> 01:37:37.067
there're a bunch of heavy
equipment blocking my way.

01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:39.100
Honey, nine-tenth
is good enough?

01:37:39.132 --> 01:37:41.645
But I need a bright visual
point of referrence

01:37:41.657 --> 01:37:44.074
so that I can see where
the landing zone is.

01:37:44.106 --> 01:37:47.078
Okay. I'm flashing my lights.
Can you see that?

01:37:47.119 --> 01:37:51.113
No, we are too far out for that, I need
a bigger light like a flare.

01:37:51.124 --> 01:37:54.262
But we are running out of time.
I have to come in right now!

01:37:54.304 --> 01:37:56.244
Chloe...

01:38:03.314 --> 01:38:06.296
Where are your smoke up matches?

01:38:11.333 --> 01:38:13.199
There isn't enough room, is there?

01:38:13.241 --> 01:38:17.068
If there isn't, I don't want her
to think it's her fault.

01:38:40.228 --> 01:38:42.387
This is it, we're coming down.

01:38:42.429 --> 01:38:44.368
Can you see anything?

01:38:44.399 --> 01:38:49.207
No. Keep looking.
We have about three miles.

01:38:58.195 --> 01:39:01.324
We've got one try.
We need to know where to start.

01:39:01.365 --> 01:39:03.241
Nothing yet!

01:39:03.242 --> 01:39:05.297
Come on, honey.

01:39:11.324 --> 01:39:13.253
There!

01:39:58.458 --> 01:40:01.419
Try to lock the landing gear!

01:40:23.266 --> 01:40:25.455
Dad, you've got no back wheels!

01:41:18.377 --> 01:41:19.503
Oh...

01:41:19.513 --> 01:41:22.350
We're home!

01:41:24.592 --> 01:41:29.368
Everyone ok? I need everyone out
of the plane now. Everyone get up!

01:42:00.495 --> 01:42:03.394
One at a time. Let's go!

01:42:04.624 --> 01:42:05.604
Let's go...

01:42:05.636 --> 01:42:09.598
When you get to the bottom, please
get out of the way for others.

01:42:22.508 --> 01:42:24.500
Hey, hey.

01:42:26.439 --> 01:42:27.607
Hey!

01:42:50.392 --> 01:42:52.623
- Buck!
- Chloe.

01:42:53.499 --> 01:42:55.564
Thank you.

01:43:01.414 --> 01:43:03.573
You did a great job.

01:43:05.418 --> 01:43:06.617
You too.

01:43:06.618 --> 01:43:08.568
Hattie!

01:43:11.571 --> 01:43:13.563
I'm sorry.

01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:15.669
I know.

01:43:22.687 --> 01:43:24.626
Dad...

01:43:27.557 --> 01:43:29.559
I should be here with you.

01:43:29.632 --> 01:43:33.480
With mom, with raymie.
I shouldn't have left.

01:43:34.449 --> 01:43:36.608
I'm just glad you're okay.

01:43:40.529 --> 01:43:42.614
I thought you might want this.

01:44:04.607 --> 01:44:07.443
Looks like the end of the world.

01:44:07.579 --> 01:44:10.519
No. Not yet.

01:44:11.656 --> 01:44:14.576
I'm afraid this is
just the beginning.
