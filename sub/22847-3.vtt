00:01.210 --> 00:03.254
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.379 --> 00:06.424
The only way to not die is to blend in
and work hard,

00:06.590 --> 00:09.051
and you can't do either of those things
without Metrics.

00:12.096 --> 00:15.391
Everyone has a role to play
to keep the Lighthouse from falling apart.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.727
- He didn't have to die.
- Somebody did.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.979
Kasius welcomes you to his suites.

00:20.146 --> 00:23.107
A life taken, a life earned.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.818
- What is wrong with you?
- You must...

00:26.777 --> 00:30.614
- learn silence.
- Ah! Ah!

00:32.908 --> 00:35.327
Virgil mentioned stories.
I'd like to see where he lived,

00:35.536 --> 00:38.080
see if we can find any clues
as to what his plan for us was.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.624
Virgil always kept this in the trawler.
Said the world might look

00:40.791 --> 00:42.585
- this way again someday.
- Do you see an Earth

00:42.793 --> 00:44.754
that can be saved?
It's too late.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.381
It's already been quaked apart.

01:29.548 --> 01:32.426
The print is considered quite fashionable
in the capital.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.264
Sinara. Ah.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.768
I knew our esteemed guest
couldn't bear to wait any longer.

01:40.976 --> 01:44.647
Kasius, how kind of you
to arrange such a...

01:45.856 --> 01:48.567
- warm welcome.
- Just an everyday affair.

01:49.443 --> 01:53.072
Would you like a drink?
The Terrans call it martini.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.324
Fermented sugars and the like.

01:58.202 --> 02:02.039
I'm here on behalf of the Lady Basha.
She sends her regrets.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.334
Mm.

02:05.876 --> 02:09.839
Well, perhaps if she knew how we prepared
the best of Earth's cuisine...

02:10.005 --> 02:13.676
She prefers dining on her own ship.
She means no disrespect.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.261
No.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.680
Surely, none taken.

02:18.848 --> 02:22.226
Of course, Lady Basha
very much looks forward to the ceremony.

02:23.227 --> 02:26.230
She has... high expectations.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.274
To be exceeded.

02:35.114 --> 02:39.201
Tye, you now have the opportunity
to give me good news about our ceremony.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.701
Jemma, we have a problem.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.453
And for your sake...

03:23.037 --> 03:24.580
I pray you can fix it.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.471
The Renewal lost me time and tokens!

03:41.138 --> 03:43.724
So, if things don't start picking up
around here,

03:44.016 --> 03:46.518
I'm gonna be doing some renewing
of my own!

03:46.810 --> 03:48.020
Is that understood?

03:48.979 --> 03:50.981
Thinking I may have been wrong
to trust Grill.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.026
This is what we call an understatement,
no?

03:54.235 --> 03:55.861
Well, the alternative was getting shot.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.988
At least Daisy's
not trapped in here.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.410
Coulson... be careful.
They're always watching.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.579
I know, but Virgil hid this thing.

04:05.955 --> 04:07.122
I got to figure out why.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.417
He did it because this tin-can place
makes people crazy!

04:10.668 --> 04:12.503
New girl!

04:12.628 --> 04:14.922
Work faster!

04:19.051 --> 04:20.886
- I'll show you fast, you...
- Yo-Yo.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.596
He zapped me!

04:24.223 --> 04:25.808
Come on!

04:35.609 --> 04:36.777
The door's rigged.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.654
Did you really think that was gonna work?

04:40.489 --> 04:41.949
Thought I'd give it a shot.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.784
Well...

04:44.952 --> 04:45.995
that don't fly with me.

04:46.495 --> 04:47.997
You see, I don't tolerate

04:48.539 --> 04:50.708
skimmers or laggers...

04:51.292 --> 04:52.835
or agitators.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.965
Hear that?

04:58.716 --> 05:01.552
As long as you owe me...

05:02.803 --> 05:04.096
I own you.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.112
Where are they? We were supposed
to meet up at the Exchange.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.072
- Something's wrong.
- Or they finally took my advice

05:22.281 --> 05:23.699
to evaporate into this place.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.117
They were looking for a way
to find Simmons.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.869
- I got to track them down.
- So you said.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.288
Don't you think
you're kind of deflecting...

05:30.205 --> 05:31.457
from what I told you about...

05:35.210 --> 05:37.171
I'm not deflecting, 'cause I didn't do it.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.256
Yeah, that's what deflecting is.

05:39.465 --> 05:42.092
How could I split the world apart?

05:42.343 --> 05:44.345
My powers aren't that strong.
I am not that strong.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.096
Maybe not yet, but you will be.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.807
- And how do you know that?
- Because planet Earth went from smooth

05:48.974 --> 05:51.143
to chunky, and Quake
is the one who did it.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.728
And you don't think
I'd remember that?

05:52.936 --> 05:55.105
Well, actually, not according
to the multiverse theory.

05:56.231 --> 06:00.694
You probably never heard of it,
but in quantum physics, there's a theory

06:00.861 --> 06:04.114
that, for every universe,
there are infinite parallel universes.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.575
So, in my universe,
you destroyed the planet.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.118
Maybe that just hasn't happened in...

06:09.620 --> 06:11.288
So what universe did that just happen in?

06:11.580 --> 06:12.790
Mine or yours?

06:14.792 --> 06:17.127
Oh, no.

06:27.096 --> 06:28.847
- Talk to me.
- There's been a Renewal.

06:29.098 --> 06:30.724
- A what?
- Three people are dead.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.561
Just hold your freak-out.
It wasn't your friends, okay?

06:34.812 --> 06:37.272
They're probably hiding, which is
what I advised them to do from the get-go.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.899
Okay, okay.
So where would they be hiding?

06:39.024 --> 06:41.026
- I don't know. They're your friends.
- And this is your home,

06:41.193 --> 06:42.820
where you know everyone and everything
that's in here.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.991
One of the vacancies
came from Grill's salvage.

06:48.117 --> 06:50.911
That means there's an opening.
He might take in strays. I'd start there.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.956
- You got all that the from shoe guy?
- Well, shoe guy knows all.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.583
Guess I should have asked him
in the first place.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.254
Don't do anything dumb, please.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.224
I was trying to get a look inside
that office.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.810
Grill's keeping that Scroll in the cabinet
behind his desk.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.312
That thing might get us into
the levels where they're keeping Simmons.

07:17.563 --> 07:20.441
- Well, he's got a handgun in there, too.
- Humans aren't allowed to have guns.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.109
Except for murder sports, apparently.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.194
Well, the point being,
we need to tread lightly.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.114
Now, Yo-Yo, if you can get in there,
maybe we can get that Scroll back.

07:27.406 --> 07:30.659
- Nice work, Mack.
- You see? Not stupid. Recon.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.662
Recon.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.126
Trawler run. Good.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.919
- That's good.
- Yeah, 'cause I barely survived

07:41.128 --> 07:42.880
- the last one.
- Take me with you.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.339
- What? No.
- Hey.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.425
Take me with you.

07:46.717 --> 07:51.763
Tess... you and your friend here
did us a kindness, taking a life.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.640
Yeah.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.101
But you still owe me a double haul.

07:56.602 --> 07:57.603
Do I?

07:57.769 --> 07:59.062
Oh, you never mentioned it.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.983
I'll need a few crushers

08:03.150 --> 08:05.152
if you want me to pack the belly full
on that thing.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.321
Got anyone expendable?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.073
Take the agitator and his friend.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.619
No big loss if one of these jokers
gets caught in the nets.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.205
If you say so.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.124
Come on, you two.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.438
- Please.
- No! You need to learn.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.024
- What did you do to her?
- She's doing it to herself.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.235
It's your problem now.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.694
Fix it.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.121
Yeah, they're gone. It's okay.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.376
What's your name?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.169
Abby.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.505
How long have you had seizures, Abby?

09:08.674 --> 09:11.468
You can talk to me. I'm a doctor.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.055
Oh. Have you always...

09:15.222 --> 09:17.099
Only since Terrigenesis.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.851
- You're Inhuman.
- Yes.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.939
And if I'm not ready for the ceremony...

09:25.482 --> 09:27.234
I don't know what's gonna happen to me.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.912
So, wait,
you're an indentured servant

09:39.079 --> 09:42.249
- to the junkyard king?
- And everyone else is on a spacewalk.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.835
But there's no time to explain.
They're tracking me.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.045
You shouldn't be seen here. You should go.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.257
- That's a great idea. Let's go.
- I can't. I need to stay.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.925
The thing I stole from the Kree guard...

09:52.801 --> 09:55.596
boss man has it in his office,
but I think I found a way to get it.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.640
That's good. If you can get it to me,
maybe I can get to Simmons.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.351
<i>Exacto</i>. So go, but stay close.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.687
Hey! New girl!

10:04.104 --> 10:06.106
You get any slower,
you're going in the crusher.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.945
I don't trust them.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.739
I always thought Virgil was skimming.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.742
Somebody has been stealing from me,

10:17.409 --> 10:20.203
so he dies, and now these guys show up?

10:20.746 --> 10:22.623
You think they're taking over
his old racket?

10:23.415 --> 10:24.666
So why send them on Virgil's run?

10:27.336 --> 10:30.922
- 'Cause you want to find proof.
- No, I want you to find proof.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.147
Flint! Clear out, kid.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.149
I thought you said
I could crash here.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.651
Yeah. Not during operation.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.697
Come on.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.998
So, less than 24 hours,
and you've already been taken prisoner.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.833
- That a record?
- Not even close.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.628
- But let's focus on the positives.
- So what's going on?

11:09.795 --> 11:11.421
Yeah, you find anything
in there, Sherlock?

11:11.630 --> 11:13.298
I think Virgil was doing recon.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.050
You said he was
in the trawler all the time?

11:15.217 --> 11:16.760
I think he was searching for something.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.971
These numbers,
they're objects in space, right?

11:20.389 --> 11:21.807
Yeah. He kept track of them.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.850
Well, this one kept showing up
over and over,

11:23.975 --> 11:26.144
this one specific part of Earth.

11:26.770 --> 11:27.813
Six-One-Six.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.775
Sure. One of the larger segments.
But I've been there.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.402
It's just a chunk of dead rock.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.779
Oh, well, maybe he hid something out
that way.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.406
I don't know. But we have to check it out.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.491
The answer to why we're here
might be out there.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.243
Then we go.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.370
I'd rather not go
where no one can hear you scream,

11:43.578 --> 11:45.455
but... Okay.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.000
Uh. I want to help you guys,

11:49.418 --> 11:51.753
but I'm already on the hook
for a double haul.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.505
There's no way I can do a side mission.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.803
This isn't a side mission.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.722
It's the mission.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.682
This is what Virgil died for.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.351
I know you don't think
he was just expendable.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.312
Look.

12:09.604 --> 12:10.897
We got to be careful.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.859
We got to cover our tracks,

12:14.067 --> 12:15.569
and if there's so much as a hic...

12:18.488 --> 12:20.157
See how you all just got quiet?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.496
That's why I'm coming on this run.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.252
- I mean, you know how it works here.
- Of course.

12:32.461 --> 12:35.172
I was just curious
about your specific experience.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.425
It's nothing special.
All the 18-year-olds go through it.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.261
When the mist hit me,
I was one of the lucky ones.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.138
Lucky. Yeah.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.350
I've heard Terrigenesis
can be a traumatic experience.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.604
I just thought of my family.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.606
It was hard to leave them, but...

12:53.315 --> 12:55.901
knowing that they'd be rewarded...
helped.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.989
- That man...
- Tye?

13:01.072 --> 13:03.074
- Is he hurting you?
- Oh, no.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.243
No, Tye's been trying to help me,

13:05.702 --> 13:07.913
teach me to control my gift.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.247
I just...

13:10.290 --> 13:12.000
haven't been able to do it yet.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.506
I don't know what will happen to them
if I can't complete the ceremony.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.468
That's where you demonstrate
your abilities.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.805
And then after, I get to go off-planet...

13:25.722 --> 13:27.974
and travel the galaxy as an ambassador.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.684
It's a dream.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.395
It's why I have to learn.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.481
I might be able to help.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.567
Can you describe what it is you can do?

13:37.901 --> 13:38.985
Yeah, well, um...

13:39.820 --> 13:41.363
sometimes I'm so light,

13:41.530 --> 13:44.407
my hand can just pass right
through things.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.327
And then, sometimes, I'm as solid as lead.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.496
You can control your molecular density.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.414
Yeah, but I can't control it.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.459
Everything in me, it just...
It tenses up...

13:55.627 --> 13:56.837
and it hurts.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.005
Sometimes the only way
I can get it to stop

13:59.130 --> 14:01.091
is if Tye turns on my blocker.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.679
That thing inhibits your powers?

14:05.971 --> 14:07.097
It helps me.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.224
They help me.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.810
I'm just not worthy of it.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.687
Abby...

14:15.564 --> 14:16.898
you are worthy.

14:17.232 --> 14:20.193
I've known many Inhumans,
and every one of them took time

14:20.360 --> 14:23.113
- to master their abilities.
- I've had time.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.615
And if I can't perform at the ceremony...

14:26.992 --> 14:29.202
Tye says that my family will be punished.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.414
So, I don't... I don't even care
what happens to me.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.249
I need to do this for them.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.751
Please.

14:42.716 --> 14:43.842
I'll help you.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.239
Mack keeping him distracted down there?

15:07.115 --> 15:08.658
Zev's enjoying giving him a hard time.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.827
I think this might be our last shot.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.001
Say what you will
about our future dystopian horror show.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.253
It has a nice view.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.964
- Dazzling.
- How's the leg?

15:24.925 --> 15:26.176
I'm not gonna lie.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.561
You think we're gonna find
something out there?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.439
Maybe a way back?

15:39.898 --> 15:42.150
I don't know. Maybe there is no way back.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.195
That doesn't sound like you.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.489
Just managing expectations.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.491
You're being fatalistic.

15:51.409 --> 15:54.496
Look... you know I'm not big
on destiny, but...

15:55.705 --> 15:57.123
maybe our destiny's here...

15:58.416 --> 16:00.752
in this time, helping these people.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.171
It's not like I don't want to help. I do.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.882
But after that, I'm going home.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.884
I spent weeks in the Framework,

16:08.134 --> 16:10.053
strapped to a board, thinking I was Hydra.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.560
I've earned a night in my own bed.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.700
Mm. Mm.

16:34.577 --> 16:35.704
New people.

16:41.793 --> 16:42.836
Hmm.

17:07.736 --> 17:08.903
New girl!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.614
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- Get over here.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.532
Your Metric's on the fritz.

17:15.660 --> 17:16.744
Arm out.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.252
There.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.630
That ought to do it.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.591
No more dilly-dallying.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.638
Zev's so busy teaching
your friend a lesson,

18:16.805 --> 18:18.598
he hasn't noticed we're off course yet.

18:19.557 --> 18:20.558
We should hurry.

18:24.395 --> 18:25.522
My God.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.858
It's a miracle anybody survived at all.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.611
I forgot I had this thing.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.366
Virgil would always do this.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.661
Said he liked seeing what Earth will look
like when it's fixed.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.247
Wouldn't fly without it.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.501
Uh... One time, he delayed us an hour,

18:46.709 --> 18:48.670
so he could go back to his bunk
and get it.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.630
Superstitious, I guess.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.424
Or...

18:58.513 --> 18:59.556
not.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.894
It's the lost knob.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.198
Virgil was talking to someone.

19:22.537 --> 19:23.788
Busted.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.001
I'm gonna enjoy this.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.755
You got everyone secured
to the wall?

19:33.590 --> 19:34.883
That's right.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.509
Good.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.869
- Thank you.
- I had to.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.580
You were all pinned to the wall,
flailing around like a bunch of hungry,

20:05.747 --> 20:07.540
- hungry hippos.
- Huh...

20:08.416 --> 20:11.336
- in my mind, it was cooler than that.
- Oh, this is bad.

20:12.587 --> 20:13.963
This is beyond bad.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.090
What did we just do?

20:16.674 --> 20:18.092
We did what we had to.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.346
No, you don't understand.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.140
We just attacked a superior.

20:25.516 --> 20:26.643
We're dead.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.899
<i>- Let's try again.</i>
- It's not gonna work.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.360
Come on. You can do this, Abby.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.583
- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, but that was impressive.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.752
- You're powerful.
- Well, not if I can't do it

20:52.961 --> 20:55.672
- when I actually want to.
- But you can.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.548
It's mind over matter.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.927
Or in your case, the literal matter
that makes up your body.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.641
Think of this place.

21:07.475 --> 21:10.103
You see a table, and this pitcher,

21:10.270 --> 21:12.146
and outside, the stars...

21:12.855 --> 21:14.065
millions of them.

21:14.649 --> 21:18.820
All of that... every part in the universe
is made of the same thing...

21:19.529 --> 21:21.614
protons, neutrons, electrons.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.243
And you know
what's between those tiny particles?

21:27.912 --> 21:28.997
Space.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.833
Infinite space.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.002
Okay.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.713
Your body is like a field of stars...

21:37.797 --> 21:39.007
but you're special.

21:39.882 --> 21:42.719
You can control the space
between the stars.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.221
The space between the stars.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.348
Imagine it.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.310
Close your eyes and imagine it.

21:52.353 --> 21:54.147
Now try again.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.666
I've never been able to hold it steady
like this before.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.168
That's good.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.086
Just remember this feeling.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.009
- I lost it. I...
- It's okay.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.595
Takes months to master a talent.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.348
Or perhaps much less time.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.100
Abby... with me.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.479
- What... what... No, wait. We're...
- We need more time.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.022
Let's all hope not.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.738
I look forward to your performance.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.410
You'll do great, Abby.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.582
- Even just a...
- Silence.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.844
Did you set our little healer up
to fail...

23:07.845 --> 23:09.389
because I think she's pretty?

23:09.597 --> 23:11.808
Or did you really think she'd succeed?

23:18.856 --> 23:20.233
You want to see me happy.

23:24.654 --> 23:25.696
Then tell me...

23:27.073 --> 23:30.243
what does Jemma have
that makes her so different...

23:31.911 --> 23:34.038
makes her capable to succeed in this?

23:39.794 --> 23:41.170
Compassion.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.346
Hmm.

24:04.402 --> 24:06.487
Do I need to ask what the hell
you're doing with that?

24:07.155 --> 24:08.573
So now you're tailing me?

24:09.240 --> 24:10.450
Shot in the dark.
You won't get it.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.285
Oh, 'cause you're too noble for me
to understand?

24:12.452 --> 24:14.537
Where I come from, we protect each other.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.957
You are storming the castle.
Any plan how you're gonna do that alive?

24:19.584 --> 24:20.710
That's what I thought.

24:21.502 --> 24:22.753
This is what I do.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.465
My friend's life is on the line,
so I'll figure something out.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.758
Oh, just all in, totally blind, huh?

24:28.092 --> 24:30.219
It's a stupid way to play,
even if you have a good hand.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.722
- You should be playing the long game.
- The long game?

24:32.930 --> 24:33.931
Yes.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.850
I can make it so that
you could waltz down there

24:36.017 --> 24:40.354
with an invitation from the big man,
but that takes serious time.

24:40.521 --> 24:43.733
- It takes finesse.
- Or it takes the Scroll that I have now.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.652
So thank you for your endless advice,
Deke.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.488
You are about to walk into a buzz saw.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.031
You're just worried
it's gonna blow back on you.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.991
This has nothing to do with me!

24:52.408 --> 24:56.496
If you pick a fight with the Blues,
they're going to take it out on all of us.

24:57.079 --> 24:59.457
Today's Renewal was for three people.
Tomorrow could be for 30.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.250
- Death comes easy here.
- Which is why I need

25:01.417 --> 25:03.044
to get to Simmons now.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.880
So if I were you, I'd get out of my way.

25:06.088 --> 25:09.091
You already destroyed the world once.
I am not gonna let you do it again.

25:13.221 --> 25:14.388
Whoa.

25:15.056 --> 25:16.849
So there she is...

25:17.808 --> 25:19.018
Quake...

25:20.186 --> 25:21.562
the destroyer of worlds.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.109
Don't ever call me that again.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.169
We're screwed. I told you,
it's a dead rock.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.213
We just risked our lives for nothing.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.259
How is he?

25:51.425 --> 25:55.096
Oh, he's out cold, for now.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.223
If we know what's good for us...

25:58.057 --> 25:59.141
maybe he stays that way.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.018
What are you getting at?

26:02.061 --> 26:05.648
I'm saying... we seal the hatch,
and we dump the load.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.568
Zev didn't make it out in time.
It was an accident.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.361
- That's murder.
- That's math.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.239
A life spent is a life earned.
That's how it works.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.449
I got that when you took out a guy
with a shotgun.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.451
And I was saving her life!

26:21.038 --> 26:22.164
What the...

26:22.540 --> 26:23.749
Is that a voice?

26:27.670 --> 26:28.879
It's a transmission.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.423
It's a faint signal, but...

26:33.718 --> 26:35.386
the source is right in front of us.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.638
That's impossible.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.933
How is anything coming
from a lifeless rock?

26:41.684 --> 26:42.852
I don't know.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.062
It could be reflecting.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.064
Yeah, I think you're right.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.400
It's only bouncing off of 616.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.944
But the, uh, signal's origins...

26:54.447 --> 26:55.990
It's coming from the surface of the Earth.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.792
May I present the Lady Basha.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.131
Your Excellency.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.051
I pray your journey was not too difficult.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.302
Kasius.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.221
Well, you have carved out a little life
for yourself

27:19.430 --> 27:20.681
on this rock, haven't you?

27:23.100 --> 27:24.101
Quite literally.

27:24.602 --> 27:27.396
From the deposit of limestones
under the surface,

27:27.855 --> 27:31.484
the crushed skeletons of marine creatures
dead a billion years.

27:32.526 --> 27:33.611
And you've been well?

27:34.737 --> 27:37.406
We fared well,
considering the remote location.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.910
Well, we've been eagerly awaiting
your arrival.

27:46.374 --> 27:47.458
What's happening?

28:05.142 --> 28:07.103
Now we'll see the fruits of her labour.

28:08.270 --> 28:12.066
Basha, my dear, I do hope
you enjoy tonight's exhibition.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.652
No, you can't...

29:03.117 --> 29:04.618
You promised me a warrior.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.289
You'll find with Inhumans,
looks can be deceiving.

29:08.789 --> 29:11.208
I hope so.
I've come a long way.

29:11.459 --> 29:14.962
And you do me a great honour,
bringing along your champion.

29:15.463 --> 29:16.881
He's hardly my champion,

29:17.339 --> 29:20.176
but he has killed 13 opponents
in seven systems.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.336
This is the best you have to offer?

29:56.420 --> 29:58.547
Let's all hope she can find her way.

29:59.381 --> 30:02.802
So many lives we prize depend
upon her success.

31:18.252 --> 31:19.420
Disappointing.

31:28.512 --> 31:29.930
Just think of the stars.

32:13.182 --> 32:15.851
It may be our warrior has found her way.

32:23.776 --> 32:24.860
Please.

32:44.088 --> 32:45.381
Extraordinary.

32:58.394 --> 33:01.814
<i>You're dead! I'm gonna feed you
to the roaches! You hear me?</i>

33:01.981 --> 33:03.524
Can't find the mute button.

33:04.108 --> 33:05.943
Hello? Is anyone out there?
Do you read?

33:06.694 --> 33:09.571
Nothing. I'm recording the transmission,
but I still can't make it out.

33:09.989 --> 33:12.324
Zev's right you know. We're roach food.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.034
<i>You're gonna regret this.</i>

33:15.494 --> 33:18.247
- We'll figure it out. We always do.
- You don't get it!

33:18.789 --> 33:21.542
The moment we lied about this mission,
someone was gonna die.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.169
- It's him or us.
- We're not dumping the load.

33:24.378 --> 33:26.463
I've got to,
while we have the chance.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.009
You gonna get in my way? Sacrifice
your lives for that piece of trash?

33:30.217 --> 33:32.177
We're not sacrificing anyone,
you understand?

33:32.636 --> 33:34.388
As S.H.I.E.L.D. we live by a code,
and we're not bending

33:34.555 --> 33:38.017
to your twisted world view.

33:38.267 --> 33:39.727
We're losing fuel, fast!

33:40.227 --> 33:41.687
We had six more hours' worth.

33:42.104 --> 33:43.897
- Zev cut the fuel line.
- May, can you get us back

33:44.064 --> 33:45.691
- to the Lighthouse?
- Yeah, I can try.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.568
You have enough
of that transmission recorded?

33:47.776 --> 33:49.862
- It's gonna have to be enough.
- Because we need to turn and burn

33:50.029 --> 33:51.613
and pray that we don't hit
a gravity storm.

33:51.822 --> 33:52.906
Do it.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.285
There goes our chance.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.120
Hope it was worth it.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.967
The Terrans
were such an unremarkable species.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.511
You have done well with their world.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.889
Well, if I can't find opportunity,
I make my own.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.018
Well, you would have to
on a grim little rock like this.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.312
Hmm.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.065
Ah.

34:29.109 --> 34:30.319
As we agreed.

35:00.224 --> 35:01.683
No, Abby, you can't!

35:05.270 --> 35:07.648
Now, Sinara, let's not be rash.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.858
Jemma demonstrated her worth.

35:10.359 --> 35:11.443
You sold her.

35:11.735 --> 35:13.153
And if not for you...

35:15.280 --> 35:18.075
she wouldn't have
fetched such a high price.

35:57.948 --> 35:59.116
Got a few more.

36:00.742 --> 36:01.952
Move it!

36:18.594 --> 36:20.095
I really thought this would work.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.009
This has been fun,
but I've got someplace to be.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.972
So not as stealth as I hoped.

37:08.852 --> 37:11.021
- Awesome.
- Are you kidding me?

37:11.188 --> 37:14.566
You have got to be the dumbest bunch
of lugs I have ever seen.

37:14.858 --> 37:18.320
Zev catches you smuggling contraband,
and then you mutiny?

37:18.528 --> 37:21.490
Mutiny? That's a strong wor...

37:22.115 --> 37:23.825
Picking up where Virgil left off?

37:24.243 --> 37:26.995
I knew someone was stealing.
Squirreling things away.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.039
Yeah, like you know what a squirrel is.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.375
Shut it, agitator!

37:31.625 --> 37:34.962
I am gonna kill the lot of you,
good and slow!

37:36.213 --> 37:38.173
But I'm starting with you.

37:38.465 --> 37:39.841
It wasn't them. It was me.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.427
- Just me.
- Tess.

37:45.722 --> 37:48.725
Grill... these people
didn't even know Virgil.

37:49.726 --> 37:52.020
So, any gripe you had with him
is with me now.

37:52.688 --> 37:54.022
Same with any contraband.

37:54.273 --> 37:55.399
You want contraband?

37:58.026 --> 38:00.153
- He has a gun.
- A gun?

38:00.654 --> 38:01.947
Zev threatened me with it.

38:02.656 --> 38:04.157
Probably threatened them, too.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.743
If you're looking for contraband,
he's got it.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.747
- No way, boss.
- Search him.

38:11.081 --> 38:13.667
If I'm wrong, I know the consequences.

38:19.673 --> 38:22.467
No way. No, no, no, no. No way.

38:22.884 --> 38:24.052
You stole this.

38:24.845 --> 38:26.763
- From someone.
- No. Wait. Wait.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.849
Humans aren't allowed to have firearms.

38:31.268 --> 38:33.687
We wanted to tell you the truth,
but he's your guy, and...

38:33.854 --> 38:35.397
We didn't want the Blues
to come down on you.

38:35.814 --> 38:39.568
That's why I'm reporting this violator
to them myself.

38:40.027 --> 38:41.987
Grill, no.

38:46.199 --> 38:49.453
You know what their punishment
is for this.

38:56.335 --> 38:57.919
Let that be a lesson.

38:59.171 --> 39:03.175
No one... is above the rules!

39:32.412 --> 39:33.663
You were right.

39:34.247 --> 39:37.751
It's a rare occasion that I am surprised,
but you can count this among them.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.296
I told you she'd find her way down here.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.591
And demonstrating her powers, no less.

39:46.093 --> 39:48.136
That right there
is a weapon of mass destruction...

39:49.221 --> 39:52.474
tied up in one pretty, little package,
all for you.

39:53.517 --> 39:55.811
We can talk about price later,
but I expect that

39:55.936 --> 39:57.521
you'll be more than fair.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.733
So, this is Quake...

40:02.984 --> 40:04.736
Destroyer of Worlds.

40:05.654 --> 40:08.115
How is it possible that she's here?

40:09.408 --> 40:11.410
The important thing is...

40:14.663 --> 40:15.914
...she's yours.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.042
I'll kill you.

40:19.584 --> 40:20.669
I swear.

40:21.545 --> 40:22.838
Sorry, sweetheart.

40:24.548 --> 40:26.133
I'm just playing the long game.

40:54.911 --> 40:57.372
All right, Phil. Enough sight-seeing.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.416
Get back to work.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.219
Who needs some sleep?
I'll get the next shift.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.346
Nice try. You slept less than all of us.

41:13.555 --> 41:15.182
Yeah, we got to get back
to salvage, anyway,

41:15.348 --> 41:17.225
so let's hope this does the trick.

41:17.434 --> 41:18.768
It's got to be remnants.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.605
Old transmissions
in a gravitational feedback loop.

41:21.771 --> 41:24.649
- I'm telling you, it's from the surface.
- Oh, that's impossible.

41:25.275 --> 41:26.985
Nothing can survive on the surface.

41:27.611 --> 41:29.529
<i>Virgil, come in.</i>

41:29.863 --> 41:31.156
<i>Do you read?</i>

41:31.865 --> 41:34.534
<i>We haven't heard from you in three days.
Please respond, Virgil.</i>

41:35.035 --> 41:36.578
<i>Have you secured the delegation?</i>

41:37.370 --> 41:40.040
He's talking about us.
We're the delegation.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.375
Whoever that is knows we're here,
knows why we're here.

41:42.626 --> 41:44.711
- So there's someone out there.
- We need to find them.

41:45.462 --> 41:46.963
- We need to find a way to get up there.
- No.

41:47.631 --> 41:48.924
You're not listening.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.551
Nothing can survive on the surface.

41:51.968 --> 41:53.595
That's where they send people to die.
