WEBVTT

00:59.885 --> 01:01.844
Okay.

01:01.887 --> 01:05.543
Okay, oh. Office
experience, which is great.

01:06.588 --> 01:07.980
Okay.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.113
So Emily, I do see
that you have something

01:10.157 --> 01:12.202
on your permanent record.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.725
Is that right?

01:13.769 --> 01:16.641
Yeah. Yes, it is.

01:16.685 --> 01:19.514
Oh. We haven't run
a background check.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.081
We don't usually do that.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.995
Could you fill us
in on the details?

01:23.039 --> 01:24.127
Sure.

01:24.171 --> 01:27.957
I have DUI, like,
a misdemeanor DUI.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.046
What happened exactly?

01:32.570 --> 01:35.138
I drove some friends
home from a concert

01:36.052 --> 01:37.619
and I ran a red light.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.142
Everybody was fine, but-

01:40.230 --> 01:42.319
And you were intoxicated?

01:45.017 --> 01:48.673
I was less intoxicated
than my friends, but yeah,

01:48.717 --> 01:50.501
that's what happened, so.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.287
Okay.

01:55.767 --> 02:00.294
So this is your official
background check,

02:00.337 --> 02:03.166
which I have read and
according to the state,

02:03.210 --> 02:05.821
you were convicted of
aggravated assault in 2016.

02:05.864 --> 02:06.778
Is that correct?

02:08.389 --> 02:10.259
So, you do have
all my information?

02:12.044 --> 02:14.699
Yeah, yeah. I'm afraid we do.

02:17.876 --> 02:18.877
Okay. Okay.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.227
Why would you-

02:20.270 --> 02:23.055
Well, if you want us

02:23.099 --> 02:24.492
to be generous with you,

02:24.535 --> 02:27.016
then you need to be generous
with us and be honest.

02:27.059 --> 02:27.886
Okay?

02:29.584 --> 02:30.454
Okay.

02:30.498 --> 02:31.760
This is a very important job.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.762
You'd be handling
private medical files.

02:34.980 --> 02:35.764
Right.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.159
Right. You're right.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.203
I'm sorry.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.901
Yeah. Let's start over, okay?

02:42.945 --> 02:43.772
Okay.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.471
Can you tell us what
happened with the assault?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.872
No.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.134
No?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.440
No. Why would you trick
somebody like that?

02:59.483 --> 03:00.789
Oh! I did not trick you.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.094
Yeah, you did.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.228
What I did is very common.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.577
That's a very common technique.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.536
Oh, is that right? So,
you do that all the time?

03:08.579 --> 03:09.972
If people chose to be honest,

03:10.015 --> 03:11.756
then I wouldn't have to
do that all the time.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.714
Well, you know what? Fuck this.

03:12.757 --> 03:13.758
I don't even want to work here.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.325
Emily, I'm sorry
you're upset but-

03:15.369 --> 03:16.196
No, you're not.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.022
Calm down, please.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.154
I am calm.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.286
And you asked me
why I want this job

03:19.329 --> 03:20.635
because I got $70,000
of student debt.

03:20.678 --> 03:21.636
There's your fucking
answer right there.

03:21.679 --> 03:22.550
Yeah. You need to leave.

03:22.593 --> 03:23.290
Yeah, actually. You know what?

03:23.333 --> 03:24.552
Give me that too.

03:24.595 --> 03:25.857
Okay, fine. Thank you.
Yeah, thank you too.

03:25.901 --> 03:26.728
Excuse me.

03:34.562 --> 03:35.345
There you go.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.216
Yo.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.931
Can I get that
dressing on the side?

05:24.759 --> 05:26.369
So, this is the house
salad, dressing on the side,

05:26.413 --> 05:29.154
then the chicken
churrasco, black beans.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.069
Okay. Did we get
two rice orders?

05:31.113 --> 05:32.070
Two rice. Two veggies.

05:32.114 --> 05:32.941
Okay, good.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.563
Hey, yo! Emily, yo. Are
you working tonight?

05:46.607 --> 05:47.477
No, I just got off.

05:47.521 --> 05:48.826
Do you want my shift?

05:48.870 --> 05:50.350
My son has a baseball
game in Glendale.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.481
His mother was
supposed to take him.

05:51.525 --> 05:52.830
I called everybody,
like, everybody.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.441
Dude, I don't usually
work downtown at night.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.051
I know this. Big favor.

06:00.838 --> 06:01.709
All right, I got you.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.754
Thank you, gracias, for real.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.497
Let me, yeah, yeah.
One second, okay?

06:08.846 --> 06:10.108
Let me hook you up.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.895
Text that number.

06:13.938 --> 06:16.245
You can make like
200 bucks in an hour.

06:16.288 --> 06:17.246
I swear to God.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.552
What is this?

06:18.595 --> 06:19.466
Dummy shopper.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.164
You know what that is? Yeah?

06:22.207 --> 06:23.208
Dummy shopper.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.646
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's super easy.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.474
You and me at lunch
tomorrow, right?

06:27.517 --> 06:28.344
Yeah, I'll see you then.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.258
All right. Be good.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.868
Thank you. Come on.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.921
Hey.
Hey.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.444
You got some mail.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.358
Thanks.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.455
Hi, yeah.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.283
I paid $400 on the 10th

06:54.326 --> 06:56.241
and it was never
applied to my balance.

06:58.896 --> 06:59.723
$400.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.902
It was applied to my interest?

07:06.687 --> 07:09.777
Sorry. How much interest
is being added a month?

08:21.022 --> 08:21.936
Doing what?

08:34.905 --> 08:36.428
Excuse me, lady.

08:36.472 --> 08:37.952
You can't park
here. You got to go.

08:37.995 --> 08:38.822
All right.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.397
Hey. Hi.
Hi, hi, hi.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.530
Yo. Sorry.
Oh no, it's all good.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.835
I just got here.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.272
God, my life is so
fucking insane right now.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.536
I can't even-
Are you okay?

08:56.579 --> 08:58.276
Yeah, no. I'm going to Portugal.

08:59.495 --> 09:00.627
For work?

09:00.670 --> 09:02.498
Yeah, I got to go
oversee this photo shoot

09:02.542 --> 09:03.586
for a print campaign.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.892
So we're going to Porto,

09:04.935 --> 09:08.417
some little village
on the Spanish border.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.462
Holy shit.
Yeah, yeah.

09:10.506 --> 09:11.899
It's only for 11 days but-

09:11.942 --> 09:13.030
11 days? That's awesome.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.858
Yeah, I know.

09:14.902 --> 09:18.340
Yeah. So how are you?

09:18.383 --> 09:19.863
What's up? It's been a minute.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.430
Are you still doing portraits?

09:21.473 --> 09:24.128
Yeah. Like, yes and no.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.130
I'm not painting at
all right now. Yeah.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.308
Paint's expensive.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.441
Yes. Yeah, I need a job.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.486
Oh.
Yeah.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.185
Like a real job, like
a real job. Yeah.

09:37.228 --> 09:40.536
Yeah. Just to like
pay my loans and yeah.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.929
So I might go back to Jersey

09:41.972 --> 09:44.366
and live with my stepdad
for awhile and save money.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.761
No. What?

09:47.804 --> 09:49.806
Is that what you want to do?

09:49.850 --> 09:51.634
No, but yeah.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.335
Okay. What if I got
you an interview?

09:57.379 --> 09:59.686
'Cause I know that we're
hiring a graphic designer

09:59.729 --> 10:01.688
and we're always
hiring assistants.

10:01.731 --> 10:02.906
Yeah, but I thought you didn't

10:02.950 --> 10:04.342
feel super comfortable
doing that.

10:04.386 --> 10:07.868
No, I know. I know I didn't
but my boss loves me.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.347
Like for real, she's
obsessed with me.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.740
Yeah.

10:10.784 --> 10:11.872
She said I have to like
tell her about my record.

10:11.915 --> 10:12.916
That's like the whole thing.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.526
Yeah. No, let me talk to her.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.006
I'll tell her we went
to art school together.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.399
I'll vouch for you.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.793
I mean, it'll be fun.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.098
Really?

10:21.142 --> 10:22.056
You're not going back
to Jersey. Fuck that.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.579
Okay.
Fuck that.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.147
Thank you.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.670
Of course.

10:27.714 --> 10:28.932
All right. Let's get a drink.

10:28.976 --> 10:32.632
Yes. Are you drinking?

10:32.675 --> 10:33.807
I'm drinking, but I don't know.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.939
Yeah, I'll have wine.
I'll take it easy.

10:45.122 --> 10:45.906
Whoa!

10:45.949 --> 10:46.950
Oh-

10:46.994 --> 10:49.779
No, no. Come on,
come on, come on.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.309
Oh my God.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.268
Oh my God, I'm drunk.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.661
Oh my God. Fuck!

11:38.480 --> 11:39.742
Hi. I'm here for the-

11:39.786 --> 11:42.353
Let me see your
driver's license.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.597
Who gave you our number?

12:09.467 --> 12:10.599
Javier Santos.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.779
Can you tell me exactly-

12:16.823 --> 12:17.693
Wait.

12:23.481 --> 12:26.789
Hello, Javier? Do you
know Emily Borato?

12:26.833 --> 12:27.790
Moretti.

12:27.834 --> 12:28.704
Boretto.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.227
Moretti.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.596
This kid
is really cool though.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.815
He acting like he
don't give a shit.

12:52.859 --> 12:56.601
Man, he over here
just .

13:17.884 --> 13:20.277
Who here has been a
dummy shopper before?

13:20.321 --> 13:22.497
Raise your hands but
only if you've done it.

13:26.109 --> 13:26.980
You did?

13:27.023 --> 13:28.155
Where? In L.A.?

13:28.198 --> 13:29.112
Nah, Milwaukee.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.505
Oh, Milwaukee.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.854
What'd you buy, snow shoes?

13:31.898 --> 13:35.118
Nah, like an iPad
Mini. Two iPad Minis.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.076
Good.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.208
So for everybody
else, listen up.

13:38.252 --> 13:41.516
In the next hour, you
will make 200 cash,

13:42.822 --> 13:44.867
but you will have to
do something illegal.

13:44.911 --> 13:45.955
You won't be in danger.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.652
You won't endanger
another person,

13:47.696 --> 13:49.306
but you will be
breaking the law.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.919
So if you're not cool
with that, I get it,

13:52.962 --> 13:54.398
and you can go with any time.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.533
Can I keep going?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.230
Yeah, that's what we want.
Uh huh.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.884
Good.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.016
Grab a card, please.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.371
In a few minutes you
will go into a store

14:10.414 --> 14:12.068
and buy some merchandise.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.985
Any of these flat
screens is okay.

14:18.205 --> 14:21.034
Just buy one and
wheel it outside.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.167
We pick up the merchandise
and we pay you.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.517
And that's it for today.

14:26.561 --> 14:27.997
These are stolen, right?

14:28.041 --> 14:30.652
The information on
them is stolen. Yes.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.481
What? Nah, man.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.746
Fuck that. I can't
fuck with y'all.

14:39.008 --> 14:39.879
Okay.

14:41.315 --> 14:46.320
Look, if you're not
cool with this, great.

14:46.711 --> 14:50.498
Take off and don't bother
calling the police.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.761
We haven't done
anything illegal yet.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.632
They won't even show up. Okay?

14:54.676 --> 14:55.851
I'm cool with it.

15:00.116 --> 15:04.251
Wait, hold on.
What's the problem?

15:04.294 --> 15:09.082
No, it's just, how do
we know the cards work?

15:09.125 --> 15:13.086
You don't. That's the hard
part, you have to trust me.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.698
What if they ask for
a driver's license?

15:16.741 --> 15:17.568
Mm.

15:21.529 --> 15:26.447
Is that you?

15:26.490 --> 15:28.579
Let's make some fucking money.

16:54.709 --> 16:59.714
Yo! Are you gonna pay for that?

17:01.237 --> 17:02.760
I'm sorry?

17:02.804 --> 17:05.894
I said, are you
gonna pay for that?

17:07.113 --> 17:09.028
I forgot. Sorry, man.

17:39.623 --> 17:42.844
Tomorrow you have the
option to do another job.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.063
It's a little bit
more complicated.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.543
We'll text you at00 PM, okay?

17:46.587 --> 17:47.762
What do I have to do?

17:49.242 --> 17:50.069
Kill someone.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.726
Just kidding. We'll
tell you tomorrow.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.337
All right.

17:57.380 --> 18:00.122
Wait. Don't you want to know
how much you get paid for it?

18:01.558 --> 18:02.907
How much?

18:02.951 --> 18:03.778
2,000.

18:04.605 --> 18:05.867
$2,000?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.610
We'll text you,
yes? One o'clock.

18:11.612 --> 18:12.439
Sure.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.911
Right there. That's good.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.219
I got it.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.624
You text that number?

19:10.236 --> 19:11.237
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.326
For real?

19:16.764 --> 19:20.202
Hey, did you do another job
for them, like, the next day?

19:21.377 --> 19:24.859
Nah, but I was curious though.

19:26.426 --> 19:27.253
I was

19:29.124 --> 19:30.125
definitely curious.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.999
Shit's broken or something.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.094
What's up? Want me to get it?

19:43.138 --> 19:44.008
Nah, I'm good.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.880
You sure?
I'm good.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.060
God, damn it!

19:56.064 --> 19:57.457
I got you.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.373
I'm not trying to get fired.
Not on my .

20:00.416 --> 20:01.504
Shh, chill.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.159
Are we supposed to eat this?

20:17.433 --> 20:18.826
Hey, what's going on?

20:18.869 --> 20:20.219
Hey. Oh, are you at work?

20:20.262 --> 20:23.134
Yeah, it's fine. Did
you talk to your boss?

20:23.178 --> 20:24.484
Oh, I'll call you back. Sorry.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.268
No, no, it's good. It's cool.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.531
Okay.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.359
Well, so we just hired
some people, apparently.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.710
My boss is being super
weird right now and like-

20:33.754 --> 20:35.712
Did you really talk to her?

20:35.756 --> 20:36.713
What? Yeah.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.368
You think I'm lying?

20:39.412 --> 20:40.239
No.

21:31.551 --> 21:32.378
Oh, fuck.

21:42.213 --> 21:44.433
It's an hour away.
So, I got to go now.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.043
What are you talking about?

21:46.087 --> 21:47.958
Wells Fargo is a half
order, you don't need me.

21:48.002 --> 21:51.179
Nah, you can't ditch out
in the middle of lunch.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.746
I'll throw you my
delivery fee. Okay?

21:52.789 --> 21:54.356
That's 30 bucks right there.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.968
What? Am I driving your car?

21:58.012 --> 22:00.275
I'll take you back to the
kitchen, you grab your car.

22:21.252 --> 22:22.079
Whoa!

22:32.829 --> 22:37.573
These are black cards. They
don't have limit, no limit.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.491
And these, take these, okay?

22:45.581 --> 22:47.888
Just listen to me
and you'll be fine.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.193
Do what I tell you to do.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.988
Go to the Southeast
corner of the Plaza.

23:01.031 --> 23:03.425
You'll see a white door,
they'll buzz you in.

23:03.469 --> 23:06.254
If you don't know
Southeast, use your phone.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.124
It's just you.

23:08.212 --> 23:09.126
Okay?
Okay.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.129
With a purchase of this size,

23:12.173 --> 23:15.568
the bank will call the vendor,
but that takes eight minutes.

23:15.611 --> 23:19.789
So once they run your card, you
have eight minutes to leave.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.835
Eight minutes or
they know it's fake.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.621
How do I know this
is going to be safe?

23:26.927 --> 23:28.494
If you don't want to
do it, don't do it.

23:28.537 --> 23:29.843
Okay? It's up to you.

24:17.281 --> 24:18.631
Hey.
Hi.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.589
How are you?
Good.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.808
Come inside.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.075
Please, come in.

24:28.118 --> 24:31.426
Okay, so you want to
test drive it, huh?

24:33.123 --> 24:35.386
No, actually my boyfriend
drove it yesterday,

24:35.430 --> 24:36.736
so I'm just here-

24:38.564 --> 24:39.478
Here to pick it up.

24:40.435 --> 24:43.482
Oh okay. Sit down.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.406
So, you don't want
to see the car, huh?

24:55.450 --> 24:56.669
No. I don't need to.

24:56.712 --> 24:59.367
He, like I said, he
drove it yesterday, so.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.761
It's a little
unusual for someone

25:01.804 --> 25:03.458
to buy a car without seeing it.

25:05.982 --> 25:06.809
Mm.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.073
Okay. Let's do it.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.119
How do you want to pay for it?

25:12.162 --> 25:13.729
Do you have a cashier's check?

25:13.773 --> 25:14.600
Yes.

25:16.993 --> 25:17.820
I've got.

25:19.996 --> 25:20.823
Okay.

25:28.962 --> 25:29.745
And-

25:29.789 --> 25:32.487
And the rests of the card.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.357
Okay.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.106
Let me see your
driver's license.

25:43.150 --> 25:43.933
Sure.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.119
Jennifer, huh?

25:57.425 --> 25:58.208
Jen.

25:58.252 --> 25:59.645
Okay. Just a moment.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.309
Takes a few seconds.

26:16.357 --> 26:17.445
It's taking its time.

26:26.628 --> 26:27.542
Please sign.

26:40.381 --> 26:41.556
There you go.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.426
Thank you.

26:45.386 --> 26:46.648
Hold on a minute.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.172
I need you to fill
out this form.

26:50.260 --> 26:53.699
This is a waiver that
states we're not responsible

26:53.742 --> 26:56.179
for any mechanical
issues after today.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.050
Sure.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.925
Take your time. There's no rush.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.669
We just got this car, you know?

27:07.713 --> 27:08.888
Oh yeah?

27:08.931 --> 27:10.324
Yeah, from Mexico.
You don't mind do you?

27:10.367 --> 27:11.368
No.

27:11.412 --> 27:15.895
Oh, but
it's a nice car.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.680
So your name was what,
Jennifer or Jen? Jen?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.029
Sure. Yeah, Jennifer.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.335
I like Jen.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.206
Oh okay. You like Jen-

27:23.250 --> 27:24.904
Yeah, Jennifer, no.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.645
Jennifer makes you too old.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.168
Oh, we wouldn't want that.

27:28.211 --> 27:31.650
Hey, get my number.
That's the car.

27:31.693 --> 27:32.476
You like it?

27:32.520 --> 27:33.347
Yeah.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.046
Get my number.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.962
Yeah, I think I
got his number too.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.137
There you go.
Thank you very much.

27:41.181 --> 27:41.964
Enjoy, yeah.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.618
It fits you nice, huh?

27:43.662 --> 27:45.794
Yeah, yeah.
You look nice, yeah.

27:45.838 --> 27:46.665
Drive safe.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.073
Just one moment, please.

28:10.993 --> 28:13.387
Hey, we just need to
go back to the office

28:13.430 --> 28:14.475
for just a second.

28:15.476 --> 28:16.869
Why? What's wrong?

28:16.912 --> 28:18.087
Nothing. We forgot one thing.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.873
It's just my fault.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.657
You can't tell me what it is?

28:22.701 --> 28:24.659
It's not a big deal, you know?

28:24.703 --> 28:28.271
So just, can you turn
off the engine, please?

28:30.796 --> 28:31.753
Turn off the engine.

28:37.759 --> 28:41.937
Hey, hey! Don't !

29:15.101 --> 29:18.365
Pull over! Pull the
fucking car over!

29:31.378 --> 29:36.383
Fuck .

29:36.687 --> 29:38.689
Oh, what the fuck
did I just told you?

30:00.755 --> 30:03.192
Hold on. What's this?

30:03.236 --> 30:04.063
Oh shit.

30:08.632 --> 30:09.938
Two grand. Let me see it.

30:09.982 --> 30:10.852
Okay. Okay.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.549
Come on. Let's go!
Okay!

30:12.593 --> 30:13.724
What the fuck are
you staring at?

30:13.768 --> 30:14.769
Give it to me.

30:17.554 --> 30:18.381
What happened?

30:20.383 --> 30:22.777
Dude fucking attack to
me. What do you think?

30:24.344 --> 30:25.127
Let me see.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.520
No, don't touch me.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.261
I just want to help, okay?
I thought it was safe.

30:28.304 --> 30:30.872
That's why you paid somebody
else to do it, right?

30:30.916 --> 30:31.786
Fuck off!

30:56.593 --> 31:01.598
Hey. Are you okay, huh?

31:01.642 --> 31:03.862
Hey, hey. Breathe.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.341
It's okay. You're okay.

31:05.385 --> 31:08.997
Okay, lean, lean forward.
Lean, lean, lean forward.

31:10.085 --> 31:13.784
Okay, good. Come on.

31:13.828 --> 31:14.655
Okay.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.923
Are you okay to drive?

31:39.419 --> 31:42.813
You can't make
money another way?

31:42.857 --> 31:44.467
You can make money another way?

32:02.050 --> 32:03.051
Make a left up here.

32:05.227 --> 32:06.011
Here?

32:06.054 --> 32:06.925
Here.

32:09.188 --> 32:11.712
Okay. You're welcome.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.890
Hey, wait, wait.

32:17.109 --> 32:17.979
Do you want this?

32:24.029 --> 32:24.855
Yes?

32:24.899 --> 32:27.119
Yes. Thank you very much.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.729
You're welcome.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.470
Is your face swelling?

32:30.513 --> 32:31.732
What?

32:31.775 --> 32:33.952
Your face? You need to
put ice on it, okay?

32:33.995 --> 32:34.778
Yeah, I know.

32:34.822 --> 32:35.649
Right away.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.435
But you need to use
the ice cubes. Yes?

32:40.959 --> 32:42.612
Yeah. You think, I don't
know how to do ice?

32:42.656 --> 32:44.701
I did not say you don't, okay?

32:44.745 --> 32:45.964
I could help. I could
come up and help.

32:46.007 --> 32:48.314
You want to help put
ice cubes on my face?

32:52.100 --> 32:52.971
Sure.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.510
Here.
Thank you.

33:10.553 --> 33:12.903
Put it right on your face.

33:15.819 --> 33:18.126
You don't have to do that.

33:31.835 --> 33:32.967
I told you there isn't any left.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.229
I know.

33:34.273 --> 33:35.056
You got no other booze.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.145
Excuse me, no. It's there.

33:48.374 --> 33:49.375
Excuse me.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.857
Did you make these?

33:53.901 --> 33:55.903
Yeah, a long time ago.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.224
Check it out.

34:14.443 --> 34:17.838
I'm going to buy this
place and fix it up.

34:19.274 --> 34:21.581
40 units, just like
this, rental properties.

34:22.668 --> 34:24.105
My man, Rahad is
going to sell it to me

34:24.149 --> 34:25.498
after he's done renovating.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.197
You're going to buy this?

34:30.242 --> 34:31.069
I am.

34:32.766 --> 34:33.636
How much is it?

34:36.030 --> 34:39.120
It's a little down payment.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.774
You make that much selling TVs?

34:43.168 --> 34:47.041
Sometimes TVs, sometimes
other things as you know.

34:48.434 --> 34:51.915
How much can one person make
if they did what you do?

34:51.958 --> 34:53.438
What I do?

34:53.482 --> 34:54.788
No, I was just wondering.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.398
I mean, I already did it twice.

34:57.921 --> 34:59.619
You could show me how to do it.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.490
Why? What's in it for me?

35:01.534 --> 35:04.058
I don't know, how
about a free car?

35:22.598 --> 35:24.165
Here.

35:24.209 --> 35:27.168
Keep it. Now you have my number.

35:29.779 --> 35:30.606
Adios.

35:52.628 --> 35:54.761
Hey, I'm sorry about
yesterday. All right?

35:54.804 --> 35:56.066
Did it go okay?

35:57.155 --> 35:59.548
Marco wants to talk to you.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.639
Hey.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.380
Yo, what happened yesterday?

36:05.424 --> 36:07.861
It was an emergency,
okay? I'm really sorry.

36:07.904 --> 36:09.254
Why didn't you call?

36:09.297 --> 36:10.385
I should have.

36:11.952 --> 36:14.346
Well, I got to cut
your lunch Wednesday,

36:14.389 --> 36:15.434
Thursday, and Friday.

36:15.477 --> 36:16.609
If you want to
double up on nights-

36:16.652 --> 36:19.220
What, what? Starting this week?

36:19.264 --> 36:20.917
This week. Yeah.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.920
No, you can't take
me off the calendar

36:23.964 --> 36:24.878
with no warning, Marco.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.749
I'm sorry, are you an employer?

36:26.793 --> 36:28.925
No, you're an
independent contractor.

36:28.969 --> 36:31.232
So quit talking like you got
rights and go back to work.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.016
Oh my God, dude. We have rights.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.061
Just because we're
not employees-

36:34.104 --> 36:35.628
Look, this isn't
a union in house.

36:35.671 --> 36:38.935
Call your shop steward
then. All right?

36:38.979 --> 36:41.242
You got a union shop
steward, call them,

36:41.286 --> 36:42.678
if not go back to work.

36:57.563 --> 37:02.568
So I can give you numbers, but
I can't make cards for you.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.526
I do not have the time.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.574
But it's easy.

37:10.358 --> 37:11.229
Watch.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.016
Here's the numbers.

37:24.938 --> 37:26.069
Here's the cards.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.144
Okay.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.319
Now, you scan the magnet.

38:06.066 --> 38:06.893
Now you try.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.071
Fucker.

38:15.597 --> 38:17.164
When you did it,
it looked so easy.

38:20.733 --> 38:22.300
Okay, wait, wait. Look, look.

38:23.388 --> 38:24.911
Pull it hard like this.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.577
We sell to a couple of vendors.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.057
They keep us on
payroll like salary,

38:41.101 --> 38:43.843
but you can sell online,
Craigslist, whatever.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.671
Yeah, that's a bad idea, right?

38:45.714 --> 38:48.543
I mean, none of this
is safe technically,

38:48.587 --> 38:51.546
but if you listen to exactly
what they say, you'll be fine.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.898
Don't mess with ATMs. Okay?

38:55.942 --> 38:57.857
Don't meet customers
at your home.

38:57.900 --> 39:01.339
And the most important thing,
don't go to the same store

39:01.382 --> 39:02.601
more than once in a week.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.560
You'll be dealing
with lots of cash.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.170
What do you use for protection?

39:08.433 --> 39:09.303
Pepper spray.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.219
No good. I got
something for you.

39:14.526 --> 39:16.615
Whoa, what do you mean?

39:18.834 --> 39:19.618
What is that?

39:19.661 --> 39:22.751
This.

39:26.451 --> 39:30.106
If you make less than
$5,000, keep it, you're done.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.894
Okay. And what if I make more?

39:34.937 --> 39:35.895
If you make more?

39:35.938 --> 39:36.765
Yeah.

39:38.419 --> 39:41.727
Then you hit me up and
we'll take things further.

40:45.965 --> 40:46.792
Shit.

40:55.365 --> 40:57.629
Hey, Michael, are
you still coming?

41:04.592 --> 41:06.333
So, it's $600?

41:06.376 --> 41:09.118
Six? No, it's $300.

41:09.162 --> 41:10.772
No, $600.

41:10.816 --> 41:12.034
You said three online.

41:14.428 --> 41:17.692
No, no, I texted you
six. I'll show you.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.566
$300.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.524
For real man. We're
in broad daylight?

41:23.568 --> 41:25.744
Oh, what's up? You
gonna call the police?

41:25.787 --> 41:27.963
I mean, we could just
steal the shit for free.

41:29.225 --> 41:30.357
All right. All right.

41:32.098 --> 41:32.881
$300.

41:32.925 --> 41:34.230
Sure. No worries.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.630
Come on, now. Where
are you going?

41:42.674 --> 41:45.024
Hold up. Hold up.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.547
$600, yes or no?

41:48.027 --> 41:50.769
$350. Hey, where are you going?

41:57.950 --> 41:59.473
What else you got?

42:47.042 --> 42:48.174
Cool, man.

42:48.217 --> 42:49.044
Thank you.

43:06.496 --> 43:07.889
So, fucking insane.

43:07.933 --> 43:09.325
It's like my favorite
color. You know it's green?

43:09.369 --> 43:13.460
And so I thought, why
can't I have a color party.

43:13.503 --> 43:14.679
You know what I'm saying?

43:14.722 --> 43:16.506
Okay, so you got my email.

43:16.550 --> 43:18.857
So you know everything
you need to do.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.946
The only thing is
he's crate training,

43:20.989 --> 43:22.556
so he has to sleep in the crate.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.775
Okay, got it.
He doesn't like it.

43:23.818 --> 43:25.341
But just, you know,
shove him in there.

43:25.385 --> 43:26.212
Hey buddy.

43:27.126 --> 43:28.649
Hey, I'm sorry about the job.

43:29.650 --> 43:30.869
It's fine.

43:30.912 --> 43:32.218
I can hook you up. I
know I can hook you up.

43:32.261 --> 43:34.002
I just got to wait for
the right time, you know?

43:34.046 --> 43:35.264
Totally.

43:35.308 --> 43:37.310
But we can talk about
it when I get back.

43:37.353 --> 43:38.137
Okay.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.834
Okay. All right, baby.

43:39.878 --> 43:42.968
Mama's gotta go to work.
I'm going to go to Portugal.

43:43.011 --> 43:44.491
Yeah.

43:44.534 --> 43:46.058
Love you.

43:46.101 --> 43:48.538
I'm really
gonna miss him.

43:48.582 --> 43:49.365
Aww.

43:49.409 --> 43:50.584
And you too. I love you.

43:50.628 --> 43:51.890
Thank you so much.

43:51.933 --> 43:53.674
Okay. Be safe.
Yeah, you too.

43:53.718 --> 43:55.371
If he's bad, you know, you
just smack him.

43:55.415 --> 43:56.242
No.

44:53.473 --> 44:58.478
Okay, I'm going to hook you
up with more numbers. Yeah?

44:59.218 --> 45:01.350
Bigger accounts. Bigger limits.

45:01.394 --> 45:02.525
Okay?

45:02.569 --> 45:03.613
Okay.

45:03.657 --> 45:04.702
Yeah?

45:04.745 --> 45:05.964
Yeah.

45:06.007 --> 45:08.270
Sit, please. This could
take a minute. Okay?

45:18.672 --> 45:19.717
I like your office.

45:22.154 --> 45:23.024
Oh yeah?

45:23.068 --> 45:27.899
Yes. The Feng Shui, it's just-

45:27.942 --> 45:32.773
Yeah, it's good,

45:32.817 --> 45:34.949
because I installed
all the lights myself.

45:34.993 --> 45:36.211
I did the lighting design.

45:36.255 --> 45:37.647
Oh, is that right?
Yeah. Yeah.

45:37.691 --> 45:39.475
It's good. I like it.

45:39.519 --> 45:40.346
Okay.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.264
I fucking hate this
place. I hate it.

45:47.048 --> 45:49.616
But just a little more.

45:49.659 --> 45:52.097
Well it's only temporary, right?

46:09.505 --> 46:10.419
This is my cousin Khalil.

46:10.463 --> 46:12.291
Khalil, this is Emily.

46:14.119 --> 46:16.164
Nice to meet you again.

46:16.208 --> 46:17.644
Nice to meet you too again.

46:18.993 --> 46:22.170
Oh, she forgot her phone
at the meeting Thursday.

46:22.214 --> 46:24.433
So, she came to.

46:29.438 --> 46:30.657
You left your phone?

46:30.700 --> 46:31.527
Yeah.

46:43.365 --> 46:45.367
Just give me one second, please.

46:45.411 --> 46:46.194
Yes? Okay.

47:02.123 --> 47:04.560
I'm sorry I was late. Okay?

47:06.345 --> 47:08.956
I'm gonna take you for a walk.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.131
I'm going to feed you.

47:12.090 --> 47:15.571
'Cause that's what
I'm supposed to do.

47:22.535 --> 47:23.362
Hello?

47:26.104 --> 47:27.583
Yeah. It's still available.

47:29.063 --> 47:31.326
Yeah. I'm just in a
different spot right now.

47:33.981 --> 47:36.157
8216 Core Team Place.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.103
Hey, excuse me.

48:09.147 --> 48:10.365
Hey. Hi.

48:10.409 --> 48:14.021
We almost caught, we
were across the street.

48:14.065 --> 48:16.371
Look, I'm Chip up
here for the Samsung.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.853
I mean, you know, we
drove all the way across-

48:19.897 --> 48:21.115
Yeah, yeah. Cool, yeah.

48:21.159 --> 48:22.551

and give me one second.

48:22.595 --> 48:23.944
No, no. We came all
across town, man.

48:23.988 --> 48:25.163
And, you know, I just
want to get it and go.

48:25.206 --> 48:25.990
One second.

48:26.033 --> 48:27.556
Is it right there though?

48:27.600 --> 48:29.167
No, it's not. I'll be
right back, all right?

48:29.210 --> 48:30.777
Let me give you a hand.

48:30.820 --> 48:31.865
Yeah, I'll be right
back, all right?

48:31.909 --> 48:34.781
No, no I'm just
giving you a hand.

48:39.699 --> 48:41.266
Stay still. Stay still!

48:45.444 --> 48:46.271
You feel that?

48:47.359 --> 48:48.664
Yeah.

48:48.708 --> 48:51.102
We know what you're
doing? We know what's up.

48:51.145 --> 48:53.887
You do what I say or I'll
slit your throat. Okay?

48:55.280 --> 48:56.150
Huh?
Yes!

48:56.194 --> 48:57.935
Okay? Do you want understand me?

48:57.978 --> 48:58.892
Yes.

48:58.936 --> 49:02.156
All right. Where's the cash at?

49:03.331 --> 49:04.593
I don't have any cash
here. I swear to God.

49:04.637 --> 49:08.336
Hey! Hey, hey, this
could be super easy.

49:08.380 --> 49:11.949
Just tell us everything.
That's all you got to do.

49:16.344 --> 49:20.261
There's a safe in
the bedroom closet. All right?

49:20.305 --> 49:23.786
Bedroom on the left, on the
right. Bedroom on the right.

49:30.532 --> 49:32.230
Hello.

49:32.273 --> 49:35.450
You're just the cutest.
You wanna go for a ride?

49:37.322 --> 49:38.149
Good boy.

49:46.461 --> 49:47.767
What the hell is that?

49:47.810 --> 49:50.161
It has a combination lock on it.

49:50.204 --> 49:51.771
Okay, open it up. Let's go!

49:51.814 --> 49:52.641
Okay.

50:04.349 --> 50:06.481
Oh my God. Are those hundreds?

50:06.525 --> 50:09.832
It's gotta be like
10, 15 grand in here.

Bag that shit up.

50:23.281 --> 50:24.151
Hmm?

51:30.217 --> 51:33.481
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, no, no, no!

51:36.180 --> 51:37.268

51:47.191 --> 51:48.148
Glendora. That's where you live?

51:48.192 --> 51:49.236
Yeah.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.150
Okay, you might
know where I live,

51:50.194 --> 51:51.151
but I know where you live too.

51:51.195 --> 51:52.196
You understand?
Yeah.

51:52.239 --> 51:53.719
You understand what I'm saying?

52:07.689 --> 52:08.995
Yes!

52:09.038 --> 52:12.390
What's up?

52:12.433 --> 52:14.131
Oh, you look sexy.

52:14.174 --> 52:15.436
Thank you. Hi, my baby!

52:16.655 --> 52:17.786
I missed you.

52:17.830 --> 52:20.180
Thank you, fuck, so
much. How was it?

52:20.224 --> 52:21.747
How was what?

52:21.790 --> 52:22.574
Barton.

52:22.617 --> 52:24.489
Oh yeah, he's no problem.

52:24.532 --> 52:25.925
Oh, thank God.

52:25.968 --> 52:27.927
He's normally such
a fucking asshole.

52:27.970 --> 52:28.884
Oh, not with me.

52:30.016 --> 52:33.324
Emily, this is Taylor.
The Taylor from work.

52:33.367 --> 52:34.934
Oh.

52:34.977 --> 52:36.544
They do our copywriting.

52:36.588 --> 52:38.024
Guys, this is Emily.

52:38.067 --> 52:43.072
Emily and I went to high
school together in the 973

52:43.116 --> 52:44.857
and we went to art
school together, so.

52:44.900 --> 52:47.381

52:47.425 --> 52:48.339
Newark

52:48.382 --> 52:50.341
Okay. Well I'm scared now.

Taylor? Oh, okay.

52:53.561 --> 52:54.388
You guys.

53:00.438 --> 53:02.788
What kind of art do you do?

53:02.831 --> 53:04.398
Um.

53:04.442 --> 53:05.704
Sorry, Liz told me
you're an artist.

53:05.747 --> 53:07.836
Oh yeah, no I, yeah, no.

53:07.880 --> 53:10.361
I haven't done anything
in a long time art wise.

53:10.404 --> 53:11.231
Oh, okay.

53:13.929 --> 53:16.758
All right. What do you do then?

53:21.633 --> 53:23.287
Credit card fraud.

53:40.608 --> 53:42.654
Hey, are you Emily?

53:42.697 --> 53:43.785
Yeah.

53:43.829 --> 53:45.309
There's a guy outside
looking for you.

53:55.406 --> 53:58.583
Hey, I didn't think
you got my text.

53:59.584 --> 54:01.455
I wasn't far away, so.

54:05.677 --> 54:06.504
Hello.

54:07.766 --> 54:08.549
Hi.

54:08.593 --> 54:10.856
This is my friend, Youcef.

54:10.899 --> 54:12.249
Hi. Liz.

54:12.292 --> 54:14.033
Oh, hello. It's very
nice to meet you.

54:14.076 --> 54:15.164
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

54:15.208 --> 54:16.775
Liz, yes? Liz?

54:16.818 --> 54:17.602
Yep.

54:19.212 --> 54:20.387
Is it your birthday, Liz?

54:20.431 --> 54:22.737
No, I just got back
from a trip, so.

54:23.869 --> 54:25.044
I'll be on the dance floor.

54:25.087 --> 54:26.393
All right. We'll see you then.

54:30.528 --> 54:33.226
Do you know all these people?

54:33.270 --> 54:34.140
No, not really.

54:36.751 --> 54:37.578
Nobody?

54:38.797 --> 54:42.627
No. They all work with
Liz at the ad agency.

54:52.114 --> 54:54.508
Do you want me to pretend
to be your boyfriend?

54:57.468 --> 55:00.601
Sure. Okay.

55:02.777 --> 55:03.604
Like this?

55:17.357 --> 55:18.663
Hey, hey, hey.

55:19.838 --> 55:24.799
Okay, so Sarah just put
in her two week notice.

55:24.973 --> 55:27.367
My boss just texted
me right now and asked

55:27.411 --> 55:31.066
if I know anyone, like,
this just happened.

55:32.459 --> 55:34.418
Do you still want to interview?

55:34.461 --> 55:36.158
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

55:36.202 --> 55:37.116
Yes.
Yeah.

55:37.159 --> 55:38.726
Just come by.

55:38.770 --> 55:40.641
Can you come by the office and
I'll prep you on everything

55:40.685 --> 55:42.774
like Tuesday at 11?

55:42.817 --> 55:45.516
Yeah, definitely.
Definitely, yeah.

55:45.559 --> 55:47.126
Okay. What did I tell you?

55:47.169 --> 55:48.257
Yeah, girl .

55:49.607 --> 55:51.304
See you in the back.

57:38.367 --> 57:41.109
Oh, they finished the painting.

57:42.197 --> 57:43.024
Good.

57:59.301 --> 58:04.002
See, what I want to do is I
want to shorten this wall.

58:04.045 --> 58:06.352
Yes? Put the bar here.

58:07.309 --> 58:09.486
So the living room
and the kitchen

58:09.529 --> 58:11.966
is like one big open space.

58:12.010 --> 58:13.054
Nice.
Yes?

58:16.667 --> 58:18.886
For all four units,
we'll do the same thing.

58:20.584 --> 58:21.933
We're going to put this up.

58:24.805 --> 58:26.677
Yeah, but do you
own this place yet?

58:28.287 --> 58:30.289
Soon.

58:30.332 --> 58:31.333
Soon.

58:41.822 --> 58:42.606
Si.

58:42.649 --> 58:43.476
Si.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.346
Si.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.787
So if you had some
money, what would you do?

58:51.092 --> 58:52.006
Pay a loan?

58:53.486 --> 58:55.706
Yeah, I would definitely
do that first.

58:55.749 --> 58:56.881
What about your art?

58:59.753 --> 59:00.885
Would you do your art?

59:02.626 --> 59:06.281
Yeah, I would make art for sure.

59:06.325 --> 59:08.545
I would paint. I love painting.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.460
It makes me happy.

59:13.767 --> 59:14.594
What else?

59:19.077 --> 59:21.601
I mean, I don't know.

59:21.645 --> 59:23.951
I just want to be
free, you know?

59:23.995 --> 59:28.608
I just want to be able
to experience things.

59:30.088 --> 59:31.742
I want to travel.

59:31.785 --> 59:33.831
I want to live in another
country for awhile.

59:33.874 --> 59:35.746
Like, I got a long list, like,

59:35.789 --> 59:37.878
I really want to go
to South America like-

59:37.922 --> 59:41.360
So, go. So, go.

59:41.403 --> 59:42.187
You can go.

59:42.230 --> 59:43.362
Yeah, no. I can't just go.

59:43.405 --> 59:46.452
Sure. Sure you can.

59:46.495 --> 59:50.412
I did. I left my home
and it was crazy.

59:51.849 --> 59:52.893
Do you miss it?

59:52.937 --> 59:54.503
Yeah, sure. Of course.

59:58.682 --> 01:00:00.074
Now you're here.

01:00:00.118 --> 01:00:01.685
Now I'm here.

01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:05.384
I was hoping you could do
something for me like a favor.

01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:06.298
Yeah?
I'd owe you.

01:00:06.341 --> 01:00:07.865
I swear to God.

01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:09.518
What is it?

01:00:09.562 --> 01:00:11.782
Don't freak out,
seriously. I'd owe you.

01:00:16.003 --> 01:00:17.004
Okay?

01:00:17.048 --> 01:00:17.831
Okay.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:18.658
Say yes.

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:19.572
No.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:23.141
Maybe you button
up your sweater.

01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:23.968
Really?

01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:24.838
Please, yes.

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:28.799
Hey, mama.

01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:30.627
So happy to see you.

01:00:32.193 --> 01:00:33.455
So, happy.
Ma.

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:37.024
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:38.547
Three kisses.

01:00:38.591 --> 01:00:41.420
Ah, come on in.

01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:44.902
Oh no, no, no, no, no, not this.

01:00:44.945 --> 01:00:46.643
Yes.
No.

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:48.775
Ancient Lebanon tradition.

01:00:48.819 --> 01:00:49.646
Really?

01:00:49.689 --> 01:00:51.952
No, that's Italiano.

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:54.041
She just wants to drink
that shit with somebody.

01:00:54.085 --> 01:00:55.347
That's not Lebanese.

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:56.914
I'll drink with you.

01:00:56.957 --> 01:00:57.784
Oh, of course.

01:00:57.828 --> 01:00:59.046
He cannot drink.

01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:02.441
He takes tiny little shit sips.

01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:04.573
I don't
take little shit sips.

01:01:04.617 --> 01:01:07.315
Tiny little baby
sips. I show you.

01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:08.447
Tiny little baby sips?

01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:09.578
Like this .

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.801
No ones'
even said that.

01:01:14.845 --> 01:01:15.672
Okay.

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:16.498
Here we go.
Here we go.

01:01:16.542 --> 01:01:17.369
One, two.

01:01:18.413 --> 01:01:20.024
You don't even do it!

01:01:20.067 --> 01:01:21.199
Come on, one, two

01:01:21.242 --> 01:01:22.026
Don't worry about me.

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.983
One, two, three.

01:01:23.027 --> 01:01:24.811
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

01:01:28.554 --> 01:01:30.164
Ooh!
It tastes so bad.

01:01:31.209 --> 01:01:32.601
He buys me an apartment.

01:01:32.645 --> 01:01:35.213
Have you seen much
better than here?

01:01:35.256 --> 01:01:37.432
I have seen, it's very nice.

01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:40.914
He makes promise all his
life, now he does it.

01:01:41.828 --> 01:01:45.310
He will become
successful businessman.

01:01:46.441 --> 01:01:49.444
I know this. I know.

01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:52.143
He does what ever
it takes. My Youcef.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.974
So what do you do in life?

01:02:00.325 --> 01:02:01.805
I'm not sure yet.

01:02:01.848 --> 01:02:04.503
You don't know? It's okay.

01:02:04.546 --> 01:02:09.029
You will figure out your
gift. God will give you gift.

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:12.293
My gift was making man.

01:02:13.817 --> 01:02:17.124
Maybe, Emily the teacher.

01:02:17.168 --> 01:02:20.954
Emily the mother.
Emily the something.

01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:29.920
Very nice. Really nice day.

01:02:32.705 --> 01:02:37.536
Ah, mama. I missed you.

01:02:39.973 --> 01:02:44.108
I have more things in the
oven. Sit down, sit down.

01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:52.943
I didn't know you were coming.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.380
I'm just in a neighborhood.

01:03:00.037 --> 01:03:00.864
I hold a video.

01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:04.519
What's that?

01:03:04.563 --> 01:03:05.825
Ah, show him.

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.963
Right there, huh? Same
store twice in one week.

01:03:13.964 --> 01:03:17.576
So they put it on the website
like that. Linden police.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:22.799
Did you drive your own car
with your own license plate?

01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:23.669
I don't think it means anything.

01:03:23.712 --> 01:03:28.543
No? Well, it's Emily, right?

01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:30.284
Right.

01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:35.942
If they find you, they
might find us. Understand?

01:03:35.986 --> 01:03:37.291
Huh?
Sure.

01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:38.597
You understand?
I understand.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.338
Okay. Look, maybe
we go to somewhere-

01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:41.295
No. You lied.

01:03:42.296 --> 01:03:45.125
You told me it was a
one time thing with her.

01:03:45.169 --> 01:03:46.474
Are you fucking
her yet at least?

01:03:46.518 --> 01:03:47.562
That's enough.

01:03:47.606 --> 01:03:48.607
Okay. That's enough.

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:50.217
At least one of
us is benefiting.

01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:51.349
Excuse me?

01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:52.306
Yes.

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:53.873
What'd you just say?

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.744
You cannot hear well?

01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:58.312
Yeah, I heard what you
said. Say it again.

01:03:58.356 --> 01:04:00.358
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:02.969
I like her. She has
bigger balls than you.

01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:06.190
I have wonderful things
for you to eat, eat.

01:04:07.539 --> 01:04:09.106
What is happening that
nobody's eating here?

01:04:09.149 --> 01:04:10.063
Oh, yes.

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:11.543
Wow. Those look good.

01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:14.633
I want people to eat
and feel calm, happy.

01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:29.735
Emily?

01:04:30.736 --> 01:04:31.650
Hi.
Hey.

01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:32.520
Hey!

01:04:33.521 --> 01:04:36.611
Oh! The blazer, bold choice.

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:37.874
Oh yeah. Is it too much?

01:04:37.917 --> 01:04:39.397
No, I love it.
It's the only jacket I have.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.441
It's very 80s.

01:04:40.485 --> 01:04:42.879
So this is how I
do the scheduling.

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:45.142
It's just one Google doc
for the entire company

01:04:45.185 --> 01:04:46.491
and basically it's open format.

01:04:46.534 --> 01:04:48.101
So anyone can go
in and make changes

01:04:48.145 --> 01:04:49.755
but realistically
nobody does that.

01:04:49.798 --> 01:04:52.497
So I'm kind of in charge of
keeping everything on point

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.628
for about 50 employees, right?

01:04:53.672 --> 01:04:55.630
I think it's 55 now.

01:04:55.674 --> 01:04:56.936
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.895
Including assistance and
everything like that.

01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:00.940
So basically it's going
to be these six columns

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:02.768
that you want to make sure
that everything is correct.

01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:04.639
This last column is going
to be the most important.

01:05:04.683 --> 01:05:06.946
And by Friday, everything
needs to be pretty much set.

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.121
So you're going to need-

01:05:08.165 --> 01:05:09.383
Now, you're gonna
kill the interview.

01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:11.342
E-mail all the bosses,
CC every Assistant,

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:12.169
all that good stuff.

01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:13.083
Thank you so much, Sarah.

01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:13.953
Yeah, of course you.

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:15.172
I'm gonna miss you.

01:05:15.215 --> 01:05:16.695
Oh, I know, I'm gonna
miss you guys too.

01:05:16.738 --> 01:05:18.262
Hey, you want to get lunch?

01:05:18.305 --> 01:05:19.567
Right now? Yeah.

01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:21.091
Yeah. There's this ramen
place around the corner.

01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:23.354
It is ruining my
life. It's so good.

01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:26.487
But I just need 10.
So, I'll be right back.

01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:27.619
Yeah, cool.

01:05:57.997 --> 01:05:58.824
Hey.

01:05:59.694 --> 01:06:01.000
Let's go.

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:02.219
What happened?

01:06:02.262 --> 01:06:03.742
Let's go. Let's drive.

01:06:03.785 --> 01:06:04.961
Hey, you're bleeding.

01:06:06.353 --> 01:06:07.528
Here. There's some
tissue in here.

01:06:07.572 --> 01:06:09.748
Drive the car.

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:11.968
All right, fine.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.322
I'm fucking done.

01:06:18.365 --> 01:06:19.279
I'm done with Khalil.

01:06:19.323 --> 01:06:20.889
So, quit.

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:24.197
Five months, five months!
He hasn't paid me a thing.

01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:25.242
He's not paying you?

01:06:25.285 --> 01:06:26.547
And now Rahad calls and tells me

01:06:26.591 --> 01:06:28.158
he needs the down payment
for the apartment.

01:06:28.201 --> 01:06:31.639
He needs it now, that
there's a cash offer

01:06:31.683 --> 01:06:33.511
from a Chinese company.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.384
I tell Khalil, you
know what he say?

01:06:38.211 --> 01:06:39.647
You know what he say?

01:06:39.691 --> 01:06:41.910
He says you work with Emily
now. Why you come to me?

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.087
So, look.

01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:49.614
Listen, tomorrow, first thing,

01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:55.620
I'm hitting the storage
units then the office.

01:06:55.663 --> 01:06:57.926
I'm going to clean up all
the cash that's there,

01:06:59.537 --> 01:07:00.668
then the bank account.

01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:04.237
We have a business account.

01:07:04.281 --> 01:07:06.500
I'm going to empty
it as much as I can.

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.763
Jesus.

01:07:08.807 --> 01:07:10.156
Are you in?

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.418
Am I in?

01:07:11.462 --> 01:07:12.767
We're working together.

01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:16.119
Yeah, but that's like a
whole other thing. Okay?

01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:20.688
I don't know if I could,

01:07:20.732 --> 01:07:22.038
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

01:07:22.081 --> 01:07:27.043
Even if I do this alone,
he's going to blame you.

01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:31.482
How much do you want?

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:40.534
Oh my God. So you're
just going to rob him?

01:07:42.667 --> 01:07:43.494
Yes.

01:07:45.974 --> 01:07:46.758
You take a cut.

01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:49.630
All your debts paid.

01:07:52.938 --> 01:07:56.072
You can travel. Get to
a new place, whatever.

01:07:58.683 --> 01:08:03.688
But listen, if you're
going to do this,

01:08:04.863 --> 01:08:06.299
you have to be in for real.

01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:14.046
For real.

01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:35.981
No. Stay here.

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:37.852
No, I gotta go to an interview.

01:09:05.966 --> 01:09:07.491
Hi.

01:09:07.533 --> 01:09:10.450
Ah, there she is.

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:11.930
Hey, it's so great to meet you.

01:09:11.973 --> 01:09:13.410
Hi.
Thanks for coming in.

01:09:13.453 --> 01:09:15.499
Good to meet you too.
Thanks for having me.

01:09:15.542 --> 01:09:17.153
Ooh, I like your accent.

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:18.893
You're clearly not
from the west coast.

01:09:18.937 --> 01:09:21.635
No, I am from New Jersey.

01:09:21.679 --> 01:09:23.071
Where?

01:09:23.115 --> 01:09:24.160
Bayonne

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:25.161
Hoboken.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:26.118
Oh, nice.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.337
Yeah. Where'd you go to school?

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.381
HBS.

01:09:28.425 --> 01:09:30.600
Junior Senior,
Ninth and Clinton.

01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:32.645
Oh yeah. I know Junior Senior.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:36.955
So you're familiar
with the company.

01:09:36.997 --> 01:09:39.523
I don't have to go through
the whole sales pitch.

01:09:43.135 --> 01:09:47.705
So you left college
before you finished?

01:09:48.575 --> 01:09:49.750
Yes.

01:09:49.794 --> 01:09:50.621
Why?

01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:53.580
I got a felony conviction.

01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:57.845
So why didn't you go
to school afterwards

01:09:57.889 --> 01:09:59.673
or a community college?

01:09:59.717 --> 01:10:02.154
I wanted to, but you know,

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:06.550
I had legal fees, and student
loans, and living expenses.

01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:10.162
I had to take care of my
grandmother, so I had to work.

01:10:14.427 --> 01:10:15.907
Okay.

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:17.343
All right.

01:10:17.387 --> 01:10:21.956
So what we're looking for
here is a design intern.

01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:24.263
Does that sound
appealing to you?

01:10:24.307 --> 01:10:25.264
Definitely. Yeah.

01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:27.527
Good. Yeah.

01:10:28.485 --> 01:10:31.009
Sorry. Is that a,
you say intern,

01:10:31.052 --> 01:10:33.098
is it a job or an internship?

01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:37.624
Well, all my
assistants are interns.

01:10:40.105 --> 01:10:42.542
So is it, sorry. Is
that a paid position?

01:10:44.892 --> 01:10:46.851
Not at first.

01:10:46.894 --> 01:10:49.070
The way it works is the
first five or six months,

01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:52.509
you get to know the business
and if you do a great job,

01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:54.511
then I'd love to
discuss it with you.

01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:55.381
Right.

01:10:57.514 --> 01:11:01.300
Sorry. I'm just trying to
wrap my head around that.

01:11:01.344 --> 01:11:02.867
So what are the hours?

01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:05.261
Regular hours.

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:15.662
You do realize this is a
very competitive position?

01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:17.185
Yeah, sure. I understand that.

01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:19.275
What I don't understand is
how you feel so comfortable

01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:21.059
asking someone to
work without pay.

01:11:21.973 --> 01:11:24.018
You know, when I was your age,

01:11:24.062 --> 01:11:25.933
they told me all I could
be was a secretary.

01:11:25.977 --> 01:11:27.718
Okay. But secretaries get paid.

01:11:27.761 --> 01:11:29.285
That's not the point.

01:11:29.328 --> 01:11:31.417
Well, when you were my age,
do you have $60,000 of debt?

01:11:31.461 --> 01:11:32.636
How about this?

01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:34.725
When I was your age,
I was the only woman

01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:36.901
in a room full of men.

01:11:36.944 --> 01:11:38.032
But you had a job.

01:11:38.076 --> 01:11:39.077
Okay. You know-

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.034
You were getting
paid. Am I wrong?

01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:40.948
I don't have the time for this.

01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:42.080
Clearly you're a bit spoiled.

01:11:42.123 --> 01:11:42.907
Spoiled.

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:43.821
Let me be frank with you.

01:11:43.864 --> 01:11:45.388
You don't belong here

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:47.346
because you think everyone
is out to get you.

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:49.305
None of us are out to
get you, especially me.

01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:50.567
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I'm trying to help you.

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:52.699
This was a fantastic,
Liz. Thanks very much.

01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:54.353
Thank you. No more
talking, just leave.

01:11:54.397 --> 01:11:55.572
Thank you so much for coming in.

01:11:55.615 --> 01:11:56.486
Hey, if you want to
tell me what to do,

01:11:56.529 --> 01:11:57.269
put me on the fucking payroll.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.531
How about that?

01:12:15.113 --> 01:12:16.462
Sorry I'm late.

01:12:16.506 --> 01:12:17.898
You okay?

01:12:17.942 --> 01:12:19.160
Yeah.

01:12:19.204 --> 01:12:19.987
You sure.

01:12:20.031 --> 01:12:20.858
Yeah.

01:12:21.772 --> 01:12:23.164
Are we good?

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:24.165
Yeah. We're good.

01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:28.561
Okay, good. Trucks
coming in 15 minutes.

01:13:32.277 --> 01:13:36.499
Youcef Haddad. H-A-D-D-A-D.

01:13:36.542 --> 01:13:37.369
Address?

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.415
1087 Van Nuys Boulevard.

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.547
Can you tell me if there's
been any activity on my

01:13:41.591 --> 01:13:45.116
business account in the
last 48 hours, please?

01:13:45.159 --> 01:13:46.247
Is this a shared account?

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:48.424
Yes, it's the shared
account. Khalil.

01:13:52.993 --> 01:13:53.820
He did? Okay.

01:13:57.171 --> 01:13:58.172
No, I don't need to.

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:03.351
Thank you.

01:14:10.794 --> 01:14:12.926
He robbed me before
I could rob him.

01:14:16.190 --> 01:14:17.627
You should go.

01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:18.497
Hey.

01:14:22.414 --> 01:14:23.937
It's going to be okay.

01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:25.373
Twice in one week.

01:14:26.984 --> 01:14:29.508
You hit the same store
twice in one week

01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:30.901
even after I told you the rules?

01:14:30.944 --> 01:14:32.337
Oh, so this is my fault??

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:34.818
He was going to do
this to you all along.

01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:35.732
I don't know about that.

01:14:35.775 --> 01:14:36.733
I do know.
I don't know.

01:14:36.776 --> 01:14:38.735
Yeah, you put up with his shit.

01:14:38.778 --> 01:14:39.997
You didn't fight
back soon enough

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.346
and you let him take
advantage of you, okay?

01:14:41.389 --> 01:14:42.390
Who's fucking fault is that?

01:14:42.434 --> 01:14:45.176
Hey! Hey, did you fucking hear?

01:14:45.219 --> 01:14:48.353
Did you hear? I just
lost everything!

01:14:48.396 --> 01:14:52.009
I am have nothing! Two
years of fucking work!

01:14:53.706 --> 01:14:54.925
Yeah. Okay.

01:14:54.968 --> 01:14:56.143
Come on, please. Get
the fuck out, please!

01:14:56.187 --> 01:14:59.582
Hey, careful! Nice.

01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:10.462
Where is he?

01:15:14.422 --> 01:15:18.775
Santa Clarita with the
Armenians, Robert and-

01:15:18.818 --> 01:15:19.906
Yeah?
Mm hmm.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:24.955
Is he there right now?
Let's go talk to him.

01:15:27.174 --> 01:15:29.089
It's a different situation
now. I need to think.

01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:31.744
Is it? Explain it.

01:15:31.788 --> 01:15:35.748
He's not alone and these
are very serious people.

01:15:35.792 --> 01:15:36.923
No, no.

01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:41.972
We're serious people. Okay?

01:15:43.190 --> 01:15:44.888
He should be scared of us.

01:15:45.932 --> 01:15:47.630
Motherfuckers will just
keep taking from you

01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:48.718
and taking from you until

01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:50.415
you make the God
damn rules yourself.

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:52.504
That's what this is about.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:55.115
Am I wrong? Am I wrong?

01:15:57.988 --> 01:16:01.992
Now, you told me I was going
to get a cut and I want my cut.

01:16:03.297 --> 01:16:04.951
So let's go right now.

01:16:04.995 --> 01:16:05.822
Right now?

01:16:05.865 --> 01:16:07.606
He thinks you're a pushover.

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:10.609
He's not expecting you to fight
back. That's an opportunity.

01:16:15.092 --> 01:16:16.572
You're a very bad influence.

01:16:23.448 --> 01:16:27.104
What's up? You're
working on your day off?

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.192
What was it for, your
assault conviction?

01:17:58.238 --> 01:18:02.112
It was just a guy I was dating
and we fought all the time.

01:18:06.203 --> 01:18:07.204
One day, I just,

01:18:09.859 --> 01:18:11.904
you know what my mistake
really was though?

01:18:13.384 --> 01:18:14.559
I didn't go far enough.

01:18:16.474 --> 01:18:17.736
I didn't really scare him.

01:18:19.782 --> 01:18:20.870
You know, 'cause if I had,

01:18:20.913 --> 01:18:22.219
he would've never
called the police.

01:18:28.181 --> 01:18:29.443
Don't follow me to close.

01:18:59.909 --> 01:19:01.301
Hi, how's it going? Khalil?

01:19:02.346 --> 01:19:03.564
What is this?

01:19:03.608 --> 01:19:06.350
I got a order, food
order for Khalil Haddad.

01:19:06.393 --> 01:19:07.612
Is this the right place?

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:11.094
All right. Just pass it through.

01:19:11.137 --> 01:19:12.138
Yeah. I don't think
it's going to fit.

01:19:12.182 --> 01:19:13.966
It's a big order. Let's see.

01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:15.011
Let
me check it out.

01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:17.317
Do you want me to
just bring it inside?

01:19:17.361 --> 01:19:18.623
No. No. Just-

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.713
Look, I got to go. Okay,
I got another order.

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:22.540
Okay. Hold on.

01:19:22.583 --> 01:19:23.410
All right .

01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:37.076
Ah, What are you doing?

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.818
Hey, shut the fuck up
or I'll zap you again.

01:19:39.862 --> 01:19:41.472
No, no, no.
Shut up.

01:19:41.515 --> 01:19:42.429
How many people are inside?

01:19:42.473 --> 01:19:43.866
I don't know?
How many people?

01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:44.692
I don't know, all right.
How many people?

01:19:44.736 --> 01:19:45.955
Six or seven! I don't know!

01:19:45.998 --> 01:19:46.825
Where's Khalil?

01:19:46.869 --> 01:19:48.261
In his room. I don't know.

01:19:48.305 --> 01:19:49.132
I don't know what's going
on. I don't know anything.

01:19:49.175 --> 01:19:50.698
Unlock the phone. Go ahead.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.791
Okay. Just let me go, please.

01:19:55.834 --> 01:19:57.227
All right, chill out. All right?

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:58.837
We're just going to park
your car down the street.

01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.273
All right, you shouldn't have
been here. It's your fault.

01:20:00.317 --> 01:20:01.318
Wait! No, no, no!

01:21:20.223 --> 01:21:22.355
You already know. Come on, man.

01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:24.792
Let's go. Don't forget the keys.

01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:15.191
He's not in there.

01:22:28.465 --> 01:22:29.988
Wait! Wait!

01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:37.430
What are you doing?

01:23:16.948 --> 01:23:18.297
Okay, now you're
going to do what I say

01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:20.386
or I'm gonna slit
your fucking throat.

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:21.692
Do you understand?

01:23:21.735 --> 01:23:22.780
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:23:22.823 --> 01:23:24.129
You took his money.
Where is it at?

01:23:24.173 --> 01:23:25.304
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:23:25.348 --> 01:23:27.785
Where is it at? Tell
me where it's at!

01:23:27.828 --> 01:23:29.047
There's no money here.

01:23:29.091 --> 01:23:30.657
What do you think, I
withdrew all that cash?

01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:32.181
You can't do that!

01:23:33.182 --> 01:23:36.141
Please, I'm going
to bleed to death.

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:39.362
Tell me where it's at
and I'll let you go.

01:23:39.405 --> 01:23:42.060
There's nothing here! Go look!

01:23:42.104 --> 01:23:42.974
You're crazy!

01:23:50.199 --> 01:23:53.680
No, no, no, no, no.

01:23:53.724 --> 01:23:55.682
I think you're lying, okay?

01:23:55.726 --> 01:23:57.075
I'm going to count to three

01:23:57.119 --> 01:23:59.556
and then I'm going
to slit your throat.

01:23:59.599 --> 01:24:00.600
One.

01:24:00.644 --> 01:24:02.385
There's really
nothing here. Okay?

01:24:02.428 --> 01:24:03.212
Two!

01:24:03.255 --> 01:24:04.648
There's no money here!

01:24:04.691 --> 01:24:06.041
Three!

01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:10.480
Okay, in the fridge.
There's cash in the fridge.

01:24:38.943 --> 01:24:41.119
Can you breathe? Can you talk?

01:24:43.643 --> 01:24:45.036
Call an ambulance.

01:24:46.168 --> 01:24:47.995
I got you. Good, good.

01:24:49.823 --> 01:24:51.216
You're all right.

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.044
Okay. Okay.

01:25:05.143 --> 01:25:07.711
All right, where are your keys?

01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:09.887
Give me your keys.

01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:10.714
What?

01:25:10.757 --> 01:25:11.584
I need your keys.

01:25:13.456 --> 01:25:15.849
I need a doctor.

01:25:15.893 --> 01:25:17.068
I know, I'm going
to get you a doctor

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:19.592
but I need your fucking
keys, all right?

01:25:19.636 --> 01:25:22.334
What happened to him?
Did you kill him?

01:25:22.378 --> 01:25:23.901
No.

01:25:23.944 --> 01:25:25.468
Hey, stay awake. Okay?

01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:26.643
I'm going to get
you to a hospital,

01:25:26.686 --> 01:25:29.385
but I need your fucking
keys, all right?

01:25:29.428 --> 01:25:32.997
What did we do? What happened?

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.869
Fuck .

01:25:42.789 --> 01:25:43.703
Fuck! Shit!

01:26:07.249 --> 01:26:12.254
I'm sorry.

01:28:01.406 --> 01:28:05.584
Here, right ?

01:28:15.159 --> 01:28:15.986
Searching!

01:28:16.943 --> 01:28:19.859
Go, go, go, go. LAPD!

01:28:19.903 --> 01:28:20.730
Clear.

01:28:24.037 --> 01:28:25.517
Clear.

01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:28.564
Got them?

01:28:30.435 --> 01:28:31.784
Clear that room.

01:28:34.178 --> 01:28:35.005
Clear.
