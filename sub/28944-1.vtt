54:49.345 --> 54:50.311
Hello?

54:50.313 --> 54:52.311
<i>Harmony, it's Beth.</i>

54:52.313 --> 54:54.475
<i>Something's happened to Mason.</i>

54:54.477 --> 54:57.645
[thunder rumbling]

54:58.411 --> 55:00.677
- [gasping]
- Go get Rusty.

55:00.679 --> 55:02.945
- How's his heart rate?
- [nurse] Irregular, I'm not getting a beat.

55:03.678 --> 55:06.044

[groaning]

55:25.411 --> 55:26.979
[beeping]

55:31.512 --> 55:33.076
We're just giving him a
sedative to calm him down...

55:33.078 --> 55:35.476
- No, don't do that, don't...
- [Doctor] Do it.

55:35.478 --> 55:38.012

[pulse beating]

56:05.678 --> 56:07.409
Harmony.

56:07.411 --> 56:08.743
[doctor] Hey, you're not
allowed in this room.

56:08.745 --> 56:09.777
Get outta here!

56:09.779 --> 56:11.445
[Beth] No, Harmony, stay.

56:14.578 --> 56:16.909
[whimpering] I can't.

56:16.911 --> 56:18.012
- [Mason] Harmony!
- No, don't go.

56:18.779 --> 56:21.279
You can't be around me.

56:21.912 --> 56:23.043
No one can.

56:23.045 --> 56:24.475
Harmony.

56:24.477 --> 56:25.476
Let go of me.

56:25.478 --> 56:26.546
Let go of me!

56:27.679 --> 56:28.810
[grunting]

56:28.812 --> 56:29.980
Harmony!

56:30.645 --> 56:32.879
[tense music]

56:41.678 --> 56:42.545
Harmony!

56:44.011 --> 56:46.945
[melancholy music]

57:04.378 --> 57:06.009
I can't do it anymore.

57:06.011 --> 57:06.878
No.

57:07.779 --> 57:09.545
Mason, don't say that.

57:09.844 --> 57:13.979
I've watched you struggle
your entire life, Mason,

57:14.944 --> 57:16.812
just to fit it.

57:17.611 --> 57:18.842
I don't know what
Harmony has done,

57:18.844 --> 57:21.511
but she has unlocked something

57:22.778 --> 57:24.843
deep inside you and
you are connecting

57:24.845 --> 57:29.510
for this first time and it's
perfect and it's pure and

57:29.512 --> 57:33.410
connecting, Mason,
it's gonna hurt.

57:33.412 --> 57:37.410
Sometimes, sometimes you feel like
your heart is gonna burst with love,

57:37.412 --> 57:41.877
with fear and you get angry and you get
sad and you get scared and you get happy.

57:41.879 --> 57:44.009
The whole thing is so
beautiful because that's life

57:44.011 --> 57:46.812
and this is gonna be
your life, your new life.

57:47.779 --> 57:51.378
My beautiful son, you're
everything this world needs.

57:51.678 --> 57:53.713
It's your one chance at love.

57:54.779 --> 57:57.043
Find your love, find your fear,

57:57.045 --> 57:58.511
own it because they're yours.

57:59.712 --> 58:02.678
You gotta get up and you
gotta go and find Harmony.

58:07.811 --> 58:10.842
[thumping]

58:10.844 --> 58:13.776
- [chattering]
- [clattering]

58:13.778 --> 58:16.846
Hey Jimmy.
What are you thinkin'?

58:18.345 --> 58:20.246
I think it's time the
kid got initiated.

58:20.577 --> 58:23.443
- [Ben] Whoa.
- Shit, you hear that, freshy, huh?

58:23.445 --> 58:24.609
Gettin' excited, huh?

58:24.611 --> 58:25.842
- Get excited.
- [indistinct]

58:25.844 --> 58:26.977
Sound good to you?

58:26.979 --> 58:28.946
What, what do you want me to do?

58:30.312 --> 58:31.609
I think it's time we
paid a little visit

58:31.611 --> 58:33.278
to your girlfriend.

58:34.478 --> 58:35.643
Who?

58:35.645 --> 58:38.742
[tense music]

58:38.744 --> 58:39.612
What for?

58:40.644 --> 58:42.076
I don't know.

58:42.078 --> 58:44.743
There's just somethin'
about her that's got me...

58:44.745 --> 58:45.613
curious.

58:49.611 --> 58:51.609
I don't [stuttering]
know, man, I mean.

58:51.611 --> 58:52.645
Hey, kid.

58:53.745 --> 58:54.980
Where's the love?

58:55.645 --> 58:57.310
Trust me.

58:57.312 --> 58:58.412
You're gonna have a blast.

58:58.679 --> 59:00.910
Come on.

59:00.912 --> 59:05.709
Sure, Jimmy. I just gotta take
a piss real fast.

59:05.711 --> 59:07.642
[chuckling]

59:07.644 --> 59:09.575
[hissing]

59:09.577 --> 59:12.445
[train rumbling]

59:24.645 --> 59:26.279
[breathing heavily]

59:27.979 --> 59:29.943
[Mason] Harmony! Harm...

59:29.945 --> 59:32.510
Mason. What's wrong?
What's happened?

59:32.512 --> 59:34.742
- Where is Harmony?
- I don't know where she is.

59:34.744 --> 59:36.742
Something is happening to us.

59:36.744 --> 59:37.877
Just calm down.

59:37.879 --> 59:38.776
Just take a breath.

59:38.778 --> 59:40.709
Just breathe, honey.

59:40.711 --> 59:42.712
That's it, just breathe.

59:44.812 --> 59:45.679
Good.

59:46.678 --> 59:48.879
Now, I don't have the
answers you need, Mason.

59:50.512 --> 59:51.942
But,

59:51.944 --> 59:53.613
I think my sister does.

59:54.512 --> 59:56.912
[tense music]

01:00:01.978 --> 01:00:03.578
[gasping]

01:00:08.712 --> 01:00:10.945
[laughing]

01:00:12.679 --> 01:00:15.279
You're so tall and handsome.

01:00:17.911 --> 01:00:19.043
I told you.

01:00:19.045 --> 01:00:20.479
[chuckling]

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:24.342
What happened when you touched?

01:00:24.344 --> 01:00:25.845
She feel it from the others?

01:00:27.345 --> 01:00:28.746
How'd you know that?

01:00:30.679 --> 01:00:31.942
Here, come here.

01:00:31.944 --> 01:00:32.813
Sit down.

01:00:37.978 --> 01:00:39.011
Now.

01:00:44.411 --> 01:00:45.678
I raised her, Mason.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:51.442
You were born on exactly
the same day

01:00:51.444 --> 01:00:53.712
in the same hospital as Harmony.

01:00:54.077 --> 01:00:56.646
Your bond with her started
the day you were born.

01:00:58.979 --> 01:01:00.446
What's happening to her?

01:01:01.679 --> 01:01:02.612
To us?

01:01:03.845 --> 01:01:05.642
I need you to suspend
your disbelief

01:01:05.644 --> 01:01:07.575
for just a moment and
listen very carefully.

01:01:07.577 --> 01:01:08.845
Can you do that?

01:01:10.844 --> 01:01:14.642
Imagine a world that was

01:01:14.644 --> 01:01:19.008
suffering an ever growing
abundance of negative energy,

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:22.975
a world where pain and
suffering, anger,

01:01:22.977 --> 01:01:26.510
fear, sadness and depression
was building,

01:01:26.512 --> 01:01:28.646
was manifesting itself
into a storm.

01:01:29.944 --> 01:01:34.378
And to balance this energy
something was sent to fight it

01:01:34.678 --> 01:01:35.979
before it was too late.

01:01:37.577 --> 01:01:38.576
Harmony.

01:01:38.578 --> 01:01:39.779
Yes, and you.

01:01:40.411 --> 01:01:42.712
The day you were both born.

01:01:43.445 --> 01:01:46.777
Five babies all with
dying mothers,

01:01:46.779 --> 01:01:48.512
all in one place.

01:01:48.911 --> 01:01:50.543
You were the tipping point.

01:01:50.545 --> 01:01:51.810
Tipping point?

01:01:51.812 --> 01:01:52.976
Tipping point to what?

01:01:52.978 --> 01:01:54.812
She's an anomaly, Mason.

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:57.575
Her birth is the
counterpoint to all this

01:01:57.577 --> 01:02:00.310
growing negative energy and
she did something to you

01:02:00.312 --> 01:02:02.813
to protect you from this
energy until the time is right.

01:02:03.745 --> 01:02:05.877
But Harmony's journey
is different to yours.

01:02:05.879 --> 01:02:07.479
She's being tested.

01:02:07.978 --> 01:02:10.008
The day she ran away
from me was the beginning

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.008
of her extraordinary
journey, one which I

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:13.511
had to let her take alone.

01:02:13.811 --> 01:02:15.012
Sorry, you...

01:02:16.712 --> 01:02:18.379
You left her alone.

01:02:19.445 --> 01:02:22.446
And she's been suffering
every night

01:02:23.577 --> 01:02:25.976
with no one to help her
and now what?

01:02:25.978 --> 01:02:28.575
You want me, you want me...

01:02:28.577 --> 01:02:29.643
You want me to sit here waiting

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:31.543
knowing that she's out there.

01:02:31.545 --> 01:02:33.610
I just need... I need to
know where she is.

01:02:33.612 --> 01:02:35.713
I don't know where she is.

01:02:36.312 --> 01:02:37.945
The gift she gave me
was a glimpse

01:02:38.779 --> 01:02:40.512
into the path ahead.

01:02:43.345 --> 01:02:45.879
Letting go of Harmony was
the hardest thing I ever,

01:02:47.745 --> 01:02:49.645
ever had to do.

01:02:52.778 --> 01:02:54.941
But she took away my fear, too.

01:02:54.943 --> 01:02:56.945
And that allowed me
to let her go.

01:02:58.578 --> 01:02:59.909
And besides, she's not alone.

01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:01.446
She never has been.

01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:04.944
[melancholy music]

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:09.678
All this time.

01:03:10.845 --> 01:03:12.379
Well, not all this time.

01:03:13.344 --> 01:03:14.445
Till the right time.

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:15.942
But...

01:03:15.944 --> 01:03:17.942
What has she done to me?

01:03:17.944 --> 01:03:20.478
[stammering]

01:03:21.544 --> 01:03:22.979
I feel like my heart
is gonna explode.

01:03:25.377 --> 01:03:26.478
That I can explain.

01:03:29.943 --> 01:03:31.011
This is you,

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:37.012
and this is Harmony.

01:03:42.744 --> 01:03:45.442
Child, to find her, you
need to look at your past

01:03:45.444 --> 01:03:48.443
and present, all of it,
what you've achieved.

01:03:48.445 --> 01:03:51.012
What you have and what
you've been given.

01:03:52.711 --> 01:03:54.011
Look for the patterns.

01:03:56.312 --> 01:03:57.808
Your connection with
her is perfect,

01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:59.512
you just need to listen to it.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:02.944
And go back to the very
beginning, Mason.

01:04:03.745 --> 01:04:04.613
Feel it.

01:04:07.779 --> 01:04:10.713
[melancholy music]

01:04:11.545 --> 01:04:15.709
Hey, wait, wait, wait, stop.
Listen to me, listen to me.

01:04:15.711 --> 01:04:19.075
Whatever you have, whatever
you do, he wants it.

01:04:19.077 --> 01:04:21.842
You... you have to get outta
here, okay?

01:04:21.844 --> 01:04:23.409
He's lookin' for you.

01:04:23.411 --> 01:04:25.511
You have to run.

01:04:26.711 --> 01:04:27.578
I can't.

01:04:28.811 --> 01:04:29.812
Please go.

01:04:35.777 --> 01:04:38.378
[tense music]

01:05:03.478 --> 01:05:06.775
- [phone ringing]
- Admin.

01:05:06.777 --> 01:05:08.844
Sarah, hi. It's Mason.

01:05:09.478 --> 01:05:13.343
- I need you to do me a big favor.
- Sure.

01:05:13.345 --> 01:05:17.475
- I need some details from the day that I was born.
- What are we lookin' for?

01:05:17.477 --> 01:05:19.546
Were there any other babies
born on the same day as me?

01:05:20.478 --> 01:05:23.312
Yeah, there were five, no,

01:05:24.077 --> 01:05:26.012
no, six actually,
by the look of it.

01:05:28.044 --> 01:05:30.809
- That's unusual.
- What is?

01:05:30.811 --> 01:05:32.776
All the mothers died
in childbirth

01:05:32.778 --> 01:05:34.745
and no fathers registered.

01:05:35.512 --> 01:05:38.008
You were all orphans,
and there was one baby,

01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:39.578
she was a Jane Doe.

01:05:39.943 --> 01:05:41.676
Is there a Harmony?

01:05:41.678 --> 01:05:44.245
No. Harmony? Who's she?

01:05:44.944 --> 01:05:45.975
It's nothing.

01:05:45.977 --> 01:05:47.942
[tense music]

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.075
Hey.

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:50.978
Hey, newbie.

01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:53.512
Where'd you run off to?

01:05:54.679 --> 01:05:55.945
[Jimmy] How was your
little chat?

01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:59.941
- Hope it was meaningful.
- [chuckles]

01:05:59.943 --> 01:06:01.011
Heartfelt.

01:06:02.611 --> 01:06:04.008
You're gonna leave her alone.

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:05.443
[Tick gasping]

01:06:05.445 --> 01:06:07.875
Look who's lost his stutter.

01:06:07.877 --> 01:06:09.741
[tense music]

01:06:09.743 --> 01:06:11.545
Special, isn't she?

01:06:12.578 --> 01:06:13.911
Can see that now.

01:06:17.677 --> 01:06:19.445
This is so awesome, huh?

01:06:23.943 --> 01:06:25.545
You're going to leave her alone.

01:06:26.444 --> 01:06:28.844
[tense music]

01:06:40.611 --> 01:06:42.546
She did something to you,
didn't she?

01:06:45.512 --> 01:06:47.645
I can see it in your eyes.

01:06:54.612 --> 01:06:55.678
It seems

01:06:56.944 --> 01:06:59.778
you're not enjoying our
company as much as I'd hoped.

01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:02.245
That's a pity.
