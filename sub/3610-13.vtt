WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:03.659
[man] Previously on Lost:

00:03.754 --> 00:06.541
I put Sayid and Desmond
on that chopper. It was my call.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.247
I'm going after it
whether they're on it or not.

00:09.468 --> 00:10.628
Oh, my God.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.716
- Lapidus!
- Yeah!

00:14.807 --> 00:17.549
- Where'd they go?
- They're up by some greenhouse.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.804
Perched up there
waiting to snatch Linus.

00:19.896 --> 00:22.353
If you could move the island
whenever you wanted,

00:22.440 --> 00:25.398
why not move it before the psychos
with guns got here?

00:25.484 --> 00:27.190
It's a measure of last resort.

00:27.278 --> 00:31.146
Go in the greenhouse. The elevator
takes you to the Orchid Station.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.528
I'm sorry, but maybe I missed the part
of what I'm supposed to do

00:34.619 --> 00:38.237
- about the armed men inside.
- How many times l have to tell you,

00:38.331 --> 00:40.037
| always have a plan.

00:42.126 --> 00:45.539
- These aren't Jack or Sawyer.
- Whoever you are, come out now!

00:45.630 --> 00:48.212
[guns cocking]

00:49.800 --> 00:53.088
My name is Benjamin Linus.
I believe you're looking for me.

00:53.930 --> 00:54.885
[thuds]

00:54.972 --> 00:59.261
Ladies and gentlemen,
the survivors of Oceanic 815.

00:59.352 --> 01:01.092
- [man] Clarification.
- [yelling]

01:01.187 --> 01:04.350
Is it possible there are
any other survivors from the crash

01:04.440 --> 01:07.273
- yet to be discovered?
- No. Absolutely not.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.154
Why did you call me, Jack?

01:20.164 --> 01:23.406
l was hoping that you'd heard,
maybe you'd go to the funeral.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.160
Why would I go to the funeral?

01:28.005 --> 01:31.748
- This is not gonna change.
- No, I'm sick of lying.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.254
l have to go.
He's gonna be wondering...

01:34.345 --> 01:35.585
Don't.

01:38.015 --> 01:42.634
- We were not supposed to leave.
- Yes, we were.

01:45.398 --> 01:47.059
Goodbye, Jack.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.983
We have to go back, Kate.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.312
- [car door shuts]
- [engine starts]

01:59.328 --> 02:01.705
We have to go back!

02:02.748 --> 02:04.830
[tires screeching]

02:10.464 --> 02:11.965
[tires skid]

02:22.977 --> 02:25.218
[exhales] "We have to go back.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.565
We have to go back"?!

02:30.109 --> 02:32.100
Who do you think you are?!

02:32.194 --> 02:35.482
You were calling me over and over
again for two days straight

02:35.573 --> 02:36.813
stoned on your pills,

02:36.907 --> 02:40.070
and you show up here with
an obituary for Jeremy Bentham?

02:42.913 --> 02:46.656
[exhales] When he came to me
and I heard what he had to say,

02:46.751 --> 02:48.912
I knew he was crazy.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.790
But you, you believed him.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.338
- Yes.
- Him, of all people.

02:54.425 --> 02:57.588
Yes, Kate, I did because he said that
that was the only way

02:57.678 --> 03:01.341
that I could keep you safe,
you and Aaron.

03:01.432 --> 03:02.387
[smacks]

03:02.475 --> 03:06.138
[breathes heavily]

03:06.228 --> 03:07.934
Don't you say his name.

03:11.609 --> 03:15.318
I still have to explain to him
why you are not there to read to him

03:15.404 --> 03:17.144
so don't you say his name!

03:19.158 --> 03:20.898
I'm sorry.

03:27.458 --> 03:30.074
I've spent the last three years
trying to forget

03:30.169 --> 03:33.286
all the horrible things
that happened the day that we left.

03:37.802 --> 03:40.919
How dare you ask me to go back?

03:57.988 --> 04:00.445
[tires skidding]

04:08.999 --> 04:11.331
[gasping]

04:13.212 --> 04:15.419
[Sawyer] You sure we're going
the right way?

04:15.965 --> 04:18.297
Lapidus said
they were headed northeast.

04:19.301 --> 04:22.008
Slow down, you look like
you're about to keel over.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.758
- I'm fine.
- Of course you are. You're always fine.

04:27.852 --> 04:30.969
- [Sawyer] This it?
- [Jack] I don't know.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.980
So, what's the plan, Sundance?

04:36.485 --> 04:38.100
- The plan is we wait to...
- [zipS]

04:38.195 --> 04:39.526
[guns cock]

04:43.200 --> 04:44.189
Hugo?

04:45.035 --> 04:46.696
Sawyer.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.580
[Zips]

04:50.207 --> 04:52.289
- You all right?
- Dude, you came back.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.207
How'd you know where l was?

04:58.382 --> 05:00.213
It's good to see you, Hurley.

05:02.011 --> 05:03.000
Yeah.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.549
Yeah, man, you too.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.673
So where the hell is he?

05:31.415 --> 05:32.404
Locke.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.245
Hello, Jack.

05:54.647 --> 05:55.932
[groans]

05:57.107 --> 06:00.599
There's enough C4 here to blow up
a bloody aircraft carrier.

06:01.654 --> 06:03.736
When I was in the army...

06:05.449 --> 06:09.317
...I did six months explosive
ordnance disposal.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.743
Which, as the saying goes,

06:11.830 --> 06:15.118
is just enough time to learn
how to blow yourself up.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.538
It's on a timer?
Why hasn't it gone off yet?

06:18.629 --> 06:22.417
This is a radio receiver.
It's like a walkie-talkie.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.965
You send it a signal and...

06:25.052 --> 06:27.213
...it triggers the bomb remotely.

06:29.682 --> 06:33.300
So can we turn off?

06:34.520 --> 06:35.885
[exhales]

06:35.980 --> 06:37.561
This is a...

06:38.691 --> 06:42.104
This is a tripwire.
Move it and boom.

06:43.153 --> 06:47.066
This is dummy wiring.
If you cut the wrong one, boom.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.069
This is multiple firing systems.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.027
You can disable one,
but the next one, boom.

06:54.206 --> 06:57.869
Uh, this battery's the power source.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.076
- You disconnect it...
- Boom.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.483
[birds chirping]

07:25.571 --> 07:27.778
What are you doing in here?

07:27.865 --> 07:30.607
There's a Dharma station below us,

07:30.701 --> 07:32.942
and I'm looking for a way to get in.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.360
To get in and do what?

07:37.041 --> 07:39.703
Hugo, James, you mind
if I spoke to Jack alone?

07:40.878 --> 07:44.041
Don't bother. We just came back
for Hurley. Let's go.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.299
- Jack, you need to hear what...
- What I need to do

07:48.385 --> 07:51.001
is to walk back to the chopper,
get on it,

07:51.096 --> 07:53.473
and get the rest of our people
off this island.

07:53.557 --> 07:57.141
Dude, probably not the best idea
right now.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.969
Those Rambo guys are taking Ben
to that helicopter.

08:00.064 --> 08:02.350
He surrendered to them an hour ago.

08:05.361 --> 08:07.647
Now why the hell would he do that?

08:12.576 --> 08:14.032
[gun cocks]

08:17.039 --> 08:19.075
So tell me something, Ben,

08:19.166 --> 08:22.658
what is it that makes you
so important, hm?

08:27.132 --> 08:28.918
I'm curious.

08:30.761 --> 08:34.470
I'm curious as to why Mr. Widmore
would pay me so much money

08:34.556 --> 08:38.469
just to come out here, capture you,
and bring you back alive.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.474
Charles Widmore tell you
to kill my daughter?

08:45.275 --> 08:47.186
[clatters]

08:48.278 --> 08:49.609
Hey!

08:50.239 --> 08:52.275
How'd he get the toolbox?

08:53.909 --> 08:54.944
- Damn it.
- [clanks]

08:58.455 --> 09:00.537
Who gave you the toolbox, Frank?

09:00.624 --> 09:02.364
- Who, uh...?
- Hey!

09:02.459 --> 09:05.542
- [rustling]
- [guns cock]

09:09.717 --> 09:12.629
- Whoa, whoa! You're good right there.
- [gaSPing]

09:14.388 --> 09:15.377
Who are you?

09:16.140 --> 09:18.256
[gasps] l'm Kate.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.218
I'm one of the passengers
of Flight 815.

09:22.312 --> 09:26.055
- Why are you running?
- [gasping] I'm being chased.

09:26.150 --> 09:27.560
By his people.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.977
Kocol, LaCour,

09:32.072 --> 09:33.733
Redfern on flank.

09:38.162 --> 09:41.074
- Come here. Get on your knees.
- [grunts]

09:41.165 --> 09:43.247
Hands above your heads, both of you.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.575
[gasping]

09:56.346 --> 09:59.088
[whispering]

10:05.731 --> 10:07.392
[thumps]

10:08.108 --> 10:09.223
[cracks]

10:23.540 --> 10:26.452
- [blasting]
- [birds squawking, whirring]

10:26.543 --> 10:27.953
Now! Spray it!

10:28.045 --> 10:31.082
[blasting]

10:34.760 --> 10:36.216
[ricochets]

10:38.889 --> 10:42.131
- [zapping]
- [grunting]

10:43.393 --> 10:45.645
[machine gun firing]

10:52.528 --> 10:54.644
Ben, stay close.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.603
Run! Run.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.154
[gun cocks]

10:58.242 --> 10:59.823
[safety lever clicks]

10:59.910 --> 11:01.320
Grenade!

11:04.373 --> 11:05.863
[explodes]

11:10.879 --> 11:12.335
[grunts]

11:29.439 --> 11:30.770
Get up.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.018
Come on, get up.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.105
- [grunting]
- [yelling]

11:41.743 --> 11:43.483

12:17.613 --> 12:19.729
[gasping]

12:20.824 --> 12:22.735
[gunshots]

12:23.619 --> 12:26.907
[gasping]

12:59.696 --> 13:01.812
Thank you for coming, Richard.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.772
My pleasure.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.156
Could you cut me free, Kate?

13:17.089 --> 13:18.704
What was the arrangement?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.417
They help us free you,
and we let them off the island.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.429
Fair enough.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.302
The helicopter is yours.

13:31.853 --> 13:34.230
You and Sayid have a safe journey back.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.647
So we can go?

13:39.653 --> 13:42.816
Off the island? That's it?

13:46.201 --> 13:47.657
That's it.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.122
Thank you, miss.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.088
Are you Hurley?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.500
Yeah.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.755
Are you dangerous?

14:10.017 --> 14:11.348
I'm sorry, do I know you?

14:11.435 --> 14:14.051
No. You don't know me,

14:14.146 --> 14:16.228
but you know my grandson.

14:18.608 --> 14:22.942
Now, we've traveled all the way
across country just so he could see you.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.777
I need to know if you're gonna do
anything crazy.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.476
Hey, Walt.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.811
Hey, Hurley.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.813
You're getting big, dude.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.905
You know, when you came back,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.241
l was waiting for one of you
to come see me,

15:19.336 --> 15:21.873
but nobody did.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.122
I'm sorry.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.385
Do you know who did come see me?

15:33.016 --> 15:34.756
Jeremy Bentham.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.348
I don't understand why you're all lying.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.903
We're lying...

15:53.703 --> 15:57.662
...because it's the only way to protect
everyone that didn't come back.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.995
Like my dad?

16:03.713 --> 16:05.874
Like your dad. Yeah.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.358
What the hell are they talking about
in there anyway?

16:35.078 --> 16:36.534
I don't know. Leader stuff.

16:36.621 --> 16:37.781
[scoffs]

16:40.584 --> 16:44.372
- Where'd you get that?
- Came from a box Ben dug up.

16:44.462 --> 16:45.588
They're good.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.251
Thanks for coming back for me.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.884
Ah! You got it.

16:57.601 --> 16:58.886
Claire and the baby OK?

17:06.276 --> 17:08.858
What did you want to talk to me
about, John?

17:11.281 --> 17:15.240
I want you to reconsider
leaving the island, Jack.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.113
I would like you to stay.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.447
- You'd like me to stay?
- Yeah. That's right.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.871
You threw a knife into the back
of an unarmed woman.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.248
You led half of our people
across the island

17:28.340 --> 17:31.002
- and got most of them killed.
- You put a gun to my head

17:31.092 --> 17:32.753
and you pulled the trigger.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.797
l was hoping we could let
bygones be bygones.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.220
Well, I'll tell you what.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.927
You stay here in your little greenhouse,

17:44.022 --> 17:45.887
but the rest of us are going home.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.975
- But you're not supposed to go home.
- What am I supposed to do?

17:50.987 --> 17:55.731
Well, I think I remember. What was it
that you said on the way to the hatch,

17:55.825 --> 17:59.909
- that crashing here was our destiny...
- You know, Jack.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.578
You know that you're here for a reason.

18:02.666 --> 18:07.160
You know it.
And if you leave this place...

18:09.297 --> 18:12.960
...that knowledge is gonna
eat you alive from the inside out...

18:14.719 --> 18:17.176
...until you decide to come back.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.676
Goodbye, John.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.346
You're gonna have to lie.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.099
Excuse me?

18:27.190 --> 18:29.772
If you have to go,

18:29.859 --> 18:32.316
then you have to lie about everything.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.690
Everything that happened
since we got to the island.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.737
It's the only way to protect it.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.368
[chuckles] It's an island, John.
No one needs to protect it.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.377
It's not an island.

18:53.383 --> 18:56.216
It's a place where miracles happen.

18:58.013 --> 19:01.505
And if you don't believe that,
Jack, if you can't believe that...

19:03.518 --> 19:06.100
...just wait till you see
what I'm about to do.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.182
There's no such thing as miracles.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.943
Well...

19:16.948 --> 19:19.735
...we'll just have to see
which one of us is right.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.487
Am I interrupting?

19:25.582 --> 19:27.413
[gun cocks]

19:30.253 --> 19:32.244
Nice to see you too, Jack.

19:33.715 --> 19:37.628
- Couldn't find the anthuriums.
- I don't know what they look like.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.137
What are you doing?

19:49.522 --> 19:50.602
Didn't you tell him?

19:51.900 --> 19:53.561
I tried.

19:55.737 --> 19:58.604
Sayid and Kate are waiting for you
at the helicopter.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.611
I understand your people from the beach
are being brought to the freighter.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.114
- What?
- I'd love to fill you in, Jack,

20:05.205 --> 20:07.366
but you, Hugo, James
need to get moving.

20:07.457 --> 20:11.325
If I were you, I'd want to be
on that boat within the hour.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.540
Goodbye, Jack. Let's go.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.671
Lie to them, Jack.

20:22.055 --> 20:26.515
If you do it half as well as you lie
to yourself, they'll believe you.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.187
[whirring]

20:50.417 --> 20:52.578
[Aaron babbling]

20:52.669 --> 20:55.376
Michael? What's going on down there?

20:58.466 --> 20:59.751
Have you told anybody?

20:59.843 --> 21:02.129
No, Michael, I didn't.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.132
Can you turn it off?

21:05.223 --> 21:07.054
It isn't even on yet.

21:07.142 --> 21:11.181
But, yeah, if what's in this tank
does what it's supposed to do,

21:11.271 --> 21:12.761
we're gonna be OK.

21:12.856 --> 21:15.063
[Aaron fussing]

21:15.150 --> 21:16.731
Look, I'll send Jin upstairs

21:16.818 --> 21:20.527
'cause no need for him to be down there
when he can be up here with you.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.821
I'm pregnant.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.540
Congratulations, Sun.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.219
- You're gonna what?
- Freeze it.

21:47.765 --> 21:51.303
This is liquid nitrogen.
We use it in the refrigeration hold.

21:52.228 --> 21:55.937
The bomb needs a charge
from the battery to detonate it, right?

21:56.024 --> 21:59.232
And the battery runs on
a chemical reaction.

21:59.319 --> 22:04.063
l spray the battery,
I can keep it cold, no reaction.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.398
Well, what's the catch?

22:07.994 --> 22:10.110
The catch is we only have one canister.

22:10.205 --> 22:12.992
We use it up, we're right back
where we started.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.662
Well, shouldn't we save it
till the light turns red?

22:16.753 --> 22:20.086
If we see that light turn red
and the battery's not already cold,

22:20.173 --> 22:22.414
that is the last thing we'll ever see.

22:22.509 --> 22:26.343
Either way,
at least we'll have a warning,

22:26.429 --> 22:29.045
- buy ourselves some time.
- All right.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.641
Freeze the battery.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.387
Jin, help me trace back these wires,

22:33.478 --> 22:37.062
make a list of where
each of them goes to.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.446
Boat!

22:53.831 --> 22:55.241
[boat powers down]

23:00.755 --> 23:01.961
Thank you.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.539
- You get them all to the boat?
- Everybody's safe.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.590
- Coming closer?
- Fixed the engine.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.669
They're gonna get as close as they can.

23:08.763 --> 23:12.176
Next trip shouldn't take so long.
I'll get water, back in a minute.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.724
- I'll get the next group ready to go.
- Thank you.

23:14.811 --> 23:17.052
- Dan!
- Yeah?

23:17.146 --> 23:18.852
Thanks for helping us.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.520
Absolutely.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.066
OK, let's go!

23:30.994 --> 23:33.531
Who told you you could
eat those peanuts?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.491
May | eat these peanuts?

23:39.586 --> 23:42.669
I'm gonna keep my eye on you, Shorty.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.749
Miles. [gasps]

23:47.844 --> 23:50.631
- Something wrong with your neck?
- Follow me, please.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.303
Dan, you're back.

23:53.558 --> 23:56.140
- What's wrong?
- I'm leaving in ten minutes,

23:56.227 --> 24:00.596
taking the next group to the freighter.
Make sure you're with me on that raft.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.811
Don't worry about me
'cause I'm gonna stay.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.438
Miles, no. I don't think
I'm getting across

24:06.529 --> 24:10.021
- the direness of the circumstance.
- You're very dire,

24:10.116 --> 24:11.652
but I'm still gonna stay.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.535
- Ten minutes.
- Yeah.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.871
I'm surprised you want to leave.

24:21.544 --> 24:22.784
Sorry?

24:22.879 --> 24:26.838
It's just weird, after all that time
you spent trying to get back here.

24:28.593 --> 24:31.209
What do you mean "get back here"?

24:34.390 --> 24:36.381
What do I mean?

24:43.358 --> 24:46.896
[creaking]

24:46.986 --> 24:50.023
[screeching]

24:57.163 --> 24:59.028
How deep is this station?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.086
Deep.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.219
- [clicks]
- [electrical whir]

25:20.895 --> 25:23.762
[clicking]

25:31.280 --> 25:33.532
[electrical buzzing]

25:35.910 --> 25:37.116
[clicks]

25:37.203 --> 25:39.034
Is this the magic box?

25:39.122 --> 25:40.612
[beeps]

25:41.207 --> 25:43.198
No, John, it's not.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.756
What is all this stuff for?

25:52.844 --> 25:55.881
Same things that all
the Dharma stations are for:

25:55.972 --> 25:57.758
Silly experiments.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.923
What kind of experiments?

26:00.017 --> 26:01.757
You know what, John?

26:03.688 --> 26:07.397
Why don't you watch
this very informative video

26:07.483 --> 26:09.519
that will answer some of your questions.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.895
And I'll take care of some business.

26:15.658 --> 26:18.821
[whirring]

26:25.793 --> 26:29.502
[up-tempo music]

26:34.677 --> 26:37.589
Hello, I’m Dr. Edgar Hal/iwax,

26:37.680 --> 26:40.763
and this is the orientation ﬁlm
for station six

26:40.850 --> 26:42.761
of the Dharma Initiative.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.717
As you've no doubt surmised,

26:44.812 --> 26:49.522
station six, or The Orchid,
is not a botanical research unit.

26:50.943 --> 26:56.438
The unique properties of this island
have created a kind of Casimir effect,

26:56.532 --> 27:00.741
allowing the Dharma Initiative
to conduct unique experiments

27:00.828 --> 27:02.910
in both space and time.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.538
This... is the vault,

27:10.213 --> 27:12.204
constructed adjacent to a pocket

27:12.298 --> 27:16.416
of what we believe to be
negatively charged exotic matter.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.222
Great care must be taken

27:20.306 --> 27:24.675
to avoid leaving inorganic materials
inside the chamber.

27:24.769 --> 27:25.929
[clanks]

27:26.020 --> 27:29.433
The electromagnetic energy
within the island

27:29.524 --> 27:32.391
can be highly volatile
and unpredictable.

27:33.194 --> 27:37.312
Now, for your own safety
and the safety of those around you,

27:37.406 --> 27:41.194
metallic objects must never be
placed within the vault.

27:42.286 --> 27:43.901
[clanks]

27:46.666 --> 27:48.372
In our ﬁrst demonstration,

27:48.459 --> 27:53.328
we will attempt to shift the test
subject 100 milliseconds ahead

27:55.758 --> 28:00.001
For the briefest of moments
the animal will seem to disappear...

28:01.138 --> 28:03.595
- ...but in reality...
- [clicks]

28:19.532 --> 28:20.521
Hey.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.318
Was he talking about
what I think he was talking about?

28:25.413 --> 28:28.280
If you mean time-traveling bunnies,
then yes.

28:31.127 --> 28:35.040
You do know he said specifically
not to put anything metal in here.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.507
[creaking]

28:47.685 --> 28:49.391
[door shuts]

28:49.478 --> 28:51.389
[elevator screeches]

28:55.026 --> 28:56.687
You expecting someone?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.270
May l have my weapon back?

29:20.009 --> 29:21.215
[Hugo] Sayid!

29:27.683 --> 29:28.843
Good to see you, dude.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.807
[gasping]

29:41.530 --> 29:44.112
Did he say something to tick you off,
Freckles?

29:44.200 --> 29:47.192
- Didn't kill that one.
- Which one did you kill?

29:51.165 --> 29:53.451
- Where's the baby?
- He's with Sun.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.874
They should be at the freighter by now.

29:56.629 --> 29:57.960
Are you OK?

29:58.047 --> 30:00.083
I am now.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.008
Hey, Kenny Rogers.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.887
What you trying to do there,
pick a lock?

30:08.975 --> 30:11.216
You got a better idea?

30:12.144 --> 30:13.725
Hacksaw.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.553
For the handcuffs, right?

30:21.570 --> 30:25.438
- OK. Take it easy.
- All right. All right.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.569
Sayid, how'd you get back?

30:27.660 --> 30:29.616
I took the Zodiac from the freighter.

30:29.704 --> 30:33.617
Is it safe? A body from the boat
washed up on the beach.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.871
It's safe now.

30:38.963 --> 30:41.500
- [screeches]
- [clanks]

30:41.590 --> 30:43.000
All right!

30:43.092 --> 30:45.048
Let's get the hell out of here!

30:49.306 --> 30:50.466
Let's go, Freckles.

30:51.267 --> 30:53.929
- I've seen enough of this rock.
- [whirring]

30:56.605 --> 30:58.436
[grunts]

31:07.616 --> 31:10.858
After we drop everyone off we
can come back and look for Claire?

31:10.953 --> 31:12.534
Absolutely.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.782
Hands and feet inside the vehicle!

31:18.169 --> 31:19.659
Let's go for a ride!

32:02.671 --> 32:04.582
[screeches]

32:21.190 --> 32:22.430
[clanks]

32:22.525 --> 32:25.483
[murmuring]

32:27.863 --> 32:30.024
I know you're down here, Ben...

32:31.742 --> 32:33.198
...crouching in the dark...

32:34.995 --> 32:37.031
...just waiting to take a shot at me.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.872
Well, you better aim for the head, Ben.

32:45.798 --> 32:49.507
Not like your boyfriend,
who shot me in the back

32:49.593 --> 32:52.209
like a coward.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.051
This body armor has...

32:58.269 --> 33:01.136
...been known to take
a bullet or two in its time.

33:06.569 --> 33:09.276
But before you take your shot, Ben...

33:10.698 --> 33:12.689
...let me tell you about this.

33:14.285 --> 33:15.741
See there?

33:16.579 --> 33:21.073
I took out a bit of
a life insurance policy, Ben.

33:23.252 --> 33:25.413
[gasps] It's a heart rate monitor.

33:25.504 --> 33:29.668
lt's connected to a radio transmitter.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.886
We call it a dead man's trigger, Ben.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.425
If my heart stops beating,

33:37.516 --> 33:39.347
it sends a little signal

33:39.435 --> 33:41.517
to the 500 pounds of C4

33:41.604 --> 33:46.268
that I've got hard-wired
out there on the freighter.

33:47.109 --> 33:50.317
That'd kill a lot of innocent people.

33:50.404 --> 33:55.114
If you think I'm bluffing,
need I remind you of...

33:55.201 --> 33:56.281
[gasps]

33:56.368 --> 33:59.451
...how your daughter looked
as she bled out.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.780
Face down in the grass.

34:09.590 --> 34:11.546
Who the hell are you?

34:12.468 --> 34:14.459
My name is John Locke.

34:15.221 --> 34:19.260
And l have no conflict with you.

34:21.477 --> 34:24.184
And neither do the people on that boat.

34:25.814 --> 34:30.308
So... why don't you put your knife down.

34:33.155 --> 34:35.316
We can talk about this.

34:38.035 --> 34:39.696
Well, John Locke...

34:42.706 --> 34:45.163
- ...l've never been one for talk...
- [clanks]

34:46.126 --> 34:47.582
[thuds]

34:47.670 --> 34:50.753
[grunting]

34:50.839 --> 34:53.091
You killed my daughter.

34:53.175 --> 34:56.963
- You killed my daughter!
- Ben! Ben, stop! Stop!

34:57.054 --> 34:58.544
[gurgles]

35:00.391 --> 35:02.757
Ben, what did you do?

35:02.851 --> 35:06.594
[gurgling]

35:06.689 --> 35:08.054
[beeps]

35:08.148 --> 35:10.855
You just killed everybody on that boat.

35:15.698 --> 35:17.154
So?

35:21.245 --> 35:22.781
Hey, Charlotte!

35:23.914 --> 35:25.950
Listen, I wanted to say,

35:26.041 --> 35:30.000
- before you get on the boat, please...
- I'm gonna stay, Daniel.

35:31.005 --> 35:32.916
[sighs] For now, anyway.

35:35.134 --> 35:36.465
Charlotte.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.840
There is no "for now."

35:40.931 --> 35:44.515
If you don't come with me,
"for now" could be forever.

35:46.228 --> 35:47.684
Nothing's forever.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.139
VVhy?

35:54.486 --> 35:57.319
Would it make any sense if I told you

35:57.406 --> 35:59.613
l was still looking
for where l was born?

36:01.201 --> 36:02.941
- No.
- [both chuckle]

36:10.878 --> 36:12.618
Goodbye, Daniel.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.725
Let me guess, you're not coming.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.681
I promised I wouldn't leave

36:34.777 --> 36:38.110
until I got everyone here
safely off this island.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.939
Relax. I'll still be here
when you get back.

36:42.951 --> 36:44.452
Right, right.

36:45.079 --> 36:46.785
When I get back.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.959
OK. Everybody ready?

36:58.884 --> 37:00.294
Let's get started.

37:06.642 --> 37:08.098
Off we go.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.190
[Desmond] I think
I might have something.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.404
OK, so...

37:19.488 --> 37:24.073
If I cut this wire, it should disconnect
the firing mechanisms.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.280
Stop!

37:29.164 --> 37:31.371
[speaking in Korean]

37:31.458 --> 37:32.698
No good.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.329
Damn it!

37:35.421 --> 37:37.662
| just don't know enough.

37:39.425 --> 37:42.258
How do we even know
your freezing trick's doing anything?

37:42.344 --> 37:45.461
We'll know if that light turns red
and we're still here.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.515
How much stuff do you have left?

37:53.063 --> 37:54.269
We got a quarter tank.

37:56.066 --> 37:58.478
What happens if we can't
deactivate the bomb?

38:00.821 --> 38:03.563
We better get everybody
the hell off this boat.

38:28.056 --> 38:31.093
- What's the matter?
- We're losing fuel.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.264
- What?!
- We're losing fuel!

38:34.354 --> 38:36.731
Look outside,
tell me if you see anything!

38:46.658 --> 38:49.775
We have a fuel leak.
A bullet must have pierced the tank.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.327
We gotta find a place to set her down.

38:53.415 --> 38:56.282
- Don't land! No fuel on the island!
- What?

38:56.376 --> 38:59.288
We gotta get to the boat
or this chopper's useless!

38:59.379 --> 39:02.963
- I'm telling you, I don't see the boat.
- Then keep looking!

39:12.601 --> 39:16.185
We gotta get every ounce of
extra weight off this chopper now!

39:17.231 --> 39:19.517
Anything not bolted down
toss it out!

39:36.375 --> 39:39.333
Now what? Is that enough?
Do we make it?

39:42.130 --> 39:45.998
I'd feel a hell of a lot better if we
were a few hundred pounds lighter.

39:50.347 --> 39:53.555
If we don't make it we're close enough
to ditch it on the beach.

39:53.642 --> 39:57.806
- Do not go back to the island!
- We might not have a choice, doc.

40:01.858 --> 40:02.847
Hey.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.691
[whispers]

40:09.366 --> 40:12.108
I want you to find her,
tell her I'm sorry.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.780
Why are you telling me this?

40:33.515 --> 40:35.255
Just do it, Freckles.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.062
Sawyer!

41:29.571 --> 41:32.859
[Sayid] Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry to
bother you. Do you have the time?

41:32.949 --> 41:34.814
Yeah. It's 8:15...

42:11.113 --> 42:14.025

- Hello, Hurley.

42:14.116 --> 42:15.606
[door closes]

42:17.953 --> 42:22.617
- I think visiting hours are over, dude.
- This isn't a visit.

42:22.707 --> 42:24.698
I want you to come with me.

42:25.544 --> 42:28.001
- Come with you where?
- Somewhere safe.

42:28.088 --> 42:30.500
Now why would I go anywhere with you?

42:30.590 --> 42:33.047
I haven't seen you in, like, forever.

42:33.135 --> 42:35.421
Because circumstances have changed.

42:36.263 --> 42:37.753
What circumstances?

42:38.890 --> 42:40.551
Bentham's dead.

42:43.145 --> 42:45.431
- What?
- Two days ago.

42:47.774 --> 42:50.231
- What happened?
- They said it was suicide.

42:50.318 --> 42:52.934
What do you mean
they said it was suicide?

42:53.029 --> 42:55.486
And why do you call him Bentham?
His name is...

42:55.574 --> 42:57.110
Don't say it.

43:00.704 --> 43:02.194
We're being watched.

43:02.998 --> 43:08.243
Dude, I've been having regular
conversations with dead people.

43:08.336 --> 43:10.463
The last thing I need now is paranoia.

43:10.547 --> 43:15.166
ljust killed a man who's been perched
outside this facility for the last week.

43:16.386 --> 43:19.173
I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.

43:23.310 --> 43:25.266
We're not going back, are we?

43:25.353 --> 43:26.934
No.

43:27.022 --> 43:29.013
Just somewhere safe.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.648
OK, then.

43:39.034 --> 43:40.319
Hold on a sec.

43:46.041 --> 43:47.872
Checkmate, Mr. Eko.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.918
[whirring]

44:00.222 --> 44:03.714
- Where's the freighter?
- I don't know. I stayed on course.

44:03.808 --> 44:05.719
They must have it on the move again.

44:07.938 --> 44:09.678
How much fuel?

44:11.566 --> 44:15.150
Four, five minutes' worth,
unless somebody else wants to jump.

44:21.910 --> 44:24.492
Soon as we get to the boat
we'll go back for him.

44:25.914 --> 44:27.370
[Hugo] Hey!

44:27.457 --> 44:30.244

45:45.994 --> 45:50.408
Get everybody off the boat. We have
maybe five minutes left in the tank.

45:50.498 --> 45:51.908
Go!

45:52.000 --> 45:53.831

46:42.842 --> 46:44.548
Go back!

46:48.390 --> 46:51.257
Go back! There's a bomb!

46:51.351 --> 46:54.639
There's a bomb!
Go back, there's a...

46:54.729 --> 46:57.937

- Did he say "bomb"?

46:58.024 --> 46:59.810
Go back!

46:59.901 --> 47:03.268

- I don't care what he's screaming!

I gotta put this bird down.

47:06.783 --> 47:09.069
No! Don't land!

- [Aaron crying]
- No, no! Look, you don't understand.

47:22.424 --> 47:25.666
Jin and Michael are doing everything
they can, but there's no time!

47:25.760 --> 47:27.796
You've gotta get off the boat now!

47:27.887 --> 47:30.173
How long till we can fly again?

47:30.265 --> 47:31.926
Somebody patch the other hole!

47:32.016 --> 47:35.008
- Give it to me, I'll do it.
- Here. Somebody pump some gas!

47:35.103 --> 47:37.344

I'll get Jin, all right?

47:52.746 --> 47:55.488

overlooked it, dude,

but isn't this the place where everybody
jumps and hugs each other?

1:10:40.904 --> 1:10:45.318
Your freighter, those men came
to the island to kill all of us.

1:10:47.035 --> 1:10:49.617
Our plane was discovered
on the bottom of the ocean.

Someone put it there, someone who
wants everyone to think we're dead.

1:10:55.210 --> 1:10:59.624
So what do you think will happen to us
when we tell them that wasn't our plane?

1:11:01.842 --> 1:11:05.084
What do you think will happen
to the people we left behind?

1:11:09.307 --> 1:11:10.888
Jack, we can't.

1:11:12.561 --> 1:11:14.517

Sailing 3,000 miles to another island.

1:15:02.707 --> 1:15:05.369

eight, nine hours.

1:15:21.893 --> 1:15:24.930
Just long enough to give you
a nice, convincing sunburn.

Well, it's been a pleasure, Frank.

1:15:28.024 --> 1:15:31.767

- Roger that, doc. [laughs]

Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

1:20:27.031 --> 1:20:29.272
Did he tell you
that l was off the island?

1:20:33.246 --> 1:20:34.782
[slurred] Yes, he did.

1:20:41.087 --> 1:20:42.702
When did you speak to him?

1:20:45.758 --> 1:20:47.294
About a month ago.

1:20:47.385 --> 1:20:48.716
And Kate?

1:20:50.346 --> 1:20:51.586
Yeah.

1:20:53.057 --> 1:20:55.048
Yeah, he came to see her too.

1:20:55.727 --> 1:20:57.263
And what did he say to you?

1:20:58.980 --> 1:21:00.595
He told me...

1:21:01.399 --> 1:21:03.640
...that after I left the island...

1:21:05.778 --> 1:21:08.110
...some very bad things happened.

1:21:11.325 --> 1:21:13.577
And he told me that it was my fault...

1:21:14.620 --> 1:21:16.121
...for leaving.

1:21:18.791 --> 1:21:21.032
And he said that I had to come back.

1:21:22.670 --> 1:21:25.582
Yes, I heard you've been flying
on passenger planes.

1:21:27.425 --> 1:21:29.632

1:21:35.641 --> 1:21:37.802
Why are you here?

1:21:39.312 --> 1:21:42.679
I'm here to tell you that
the island won't let you come alone.

1:21:50.615 --> 1:21:52.981
All of you have to go back.

1:21:53.075 --> 1:21:54.656

She won't even talk to me anymore.

1:22:17.350 --> 1:22:19.341
Perhaps I can help you with that.

1:22:22.980 --> 1:22:26.313
This is the way it has to be, Jack.
It's the only way.

1:22:28.903 --> 1:22:31.189
