WEBVTT

00:07.040 --> 00:09.320
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:10.680 --> 00:13.960
'This time
they're ballin' in Bali.'

00:14.040 --> 00:15.400
Party!

00:17.720 --> 00:20.400
'Eight sexy singles
looking for love.'

00:21.880 --> 00:23.560
He's the only one I've loved.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.000
I love this girl
and I'm gonna fucking be with her.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.720
'By getting over
the ghosts of their pasts

00:30.800 --> 00:32.960
on the beach of doom.'

00:35.840 --> 00:37.200
Fuck's sake.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.600
(shouting)

00:38.680 --> 00:41.440
He better not get with anyone.
I'd go fucking mad.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.880
'There'll be tantrums...'
I am fucking fuming!

00:46.520 --> 00:49.160
You shagged my fucking good mate
behind my back.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.680
'...trauma...'

00:50.760 --> 00:53.760
(shouting)
Come on, then.

00:53.840 --> 00:57.040
'...and as always,
the Tablet of Terror is on hand

00:57.120 --> 00:59.160
to cause misery...'

00:59.240 --> 01:02.360
I'm sick of being like this
every single time with you.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.720
'...and mischief.'

01:03.800 --> 01:04.920
Bye!

01:05.000 --> 01:08.560
'Love hurts, and it hurts like hell.'

01:08.640 --> 01:10.600
'Four exes have arrived.'

01:12.280 --> 01:14.400
Coo-coo! (laughs)

01:15.920 --> 01:17.440
Bring it on, pencil dick.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.640
I fucking love it!

01:49.920 --> 01:53.040
There is still no fucking action
in this villa.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.200
This ain't a convent. Last night,
Chloe's giving me the cold shoulder.

01:57.280 --> 02:01.600
I was a bit gutted. Hopefully, some
fresh meat's gonna come to the villa.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.120
I woke up this morning,
and I'm lying next to Marty.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.280
We didn't have sex. Hallelujah!

02:09.360 --> 02:11.680
This means that I'm starting
to move on.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.680
Me and him can be in a bed together

02:13.760 --> 02:16.400
and not even touch each other's
ball sacs.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.760
I didn't do so much as lay
a finger on her, never mind up her.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.800
Me and Marty keep sharing
danger kisses.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.120
The idea of Chloe
getting pissed off at me

02:26.200 --> 02:28.800
is stopping me going
anywhere with Marty.

02:28.880 --> 02:32.280
Although Chloe has told the girls
that they can get with Marty

02:32.360 --> 02:35.440
and she wouldn't mind,
I know fine well that's a lie.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.400
I'm gonna turn danger kisses
with Savannah into a danger shag.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.360
So, no-one's to know.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.200
If Chloe finds out,
she'll probably kick off.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.440
Last night, Max picked Georgia,
and she is a fucking tramp.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.680
If I was gonna bang somebody,

02:51.760 --> 02:54.640
I couldn't exactly crack on
with Max now.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.560
So, it would be Dean.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.760
I'm gonna start cracking on
and having fun right now.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.920
Georgia mugged me right off
last night, fucked my plan up.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.800
What a shit turnout.
Max, you can fucking have her.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.800
Today's plan is put the feelers out.

03:12.520 --> 03:16.280
I went to bed with Max. We had a
nice kiss, and then he stormed out.

03:16.360 --> 03:20.000
If you really like me, Max,
you wouldn't have walked out.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.160
Georgia was ridiculous.
She's fucked my best mate.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.960
She's kissed Deano in here.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.840
And she's got the cheek to tell me
she worried about what I'm gonna do.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.480
All it is, it was frustrating me.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.200
I had to take myself
out of the situation.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.000
I do hope I can get past
feeling insecure about Max,

03:37.080 --> 03:40.640
cos I'm scared if another girl
comes in, he's gonna fuck me off.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.000
Me and Georgia are kind of in limbo.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.920
If we're not having a good laugh,
and a new girl says,

03:46.000 --> 03:49.440
"I like you", how can Georgia
think I've got loyalties to her?

03:49.520 --> 03:51.400
Let's just move on then.
Exactly.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.200
With Georgia, nothing's happening.
Me and Marty are getting on.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.400
I see him as one of me best friends.
We need to be careful.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.480
If my ex come in,
that could be very dangerous.

04:15.560 --> 04:21.200
I've got a feeling, right,
if he comes in, he's gonna say...

04:23.320 --> 04:26.000
If Chloe's ex, Sam, came in,
he fucking hates me,

04:26.080 --> 04:29.440
so Chloe won't be able to talk
to us, and I'll be heartbroken.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.280
What if it was me or him?

04:31.360 --> 04:35.200
Him. Sorry, but I do.
I'd have to say him.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.760
That's fucking ill, that, like.
If your ex came, you'd choose her.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.240
No, I wouldn't.
You would.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.360
Fuck.
You choose random girls over me.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.920
With Marty,
one minute he wants to be over us,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.960
but once he feels I'm over him,
he wants us to be jealous.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.840
I'm just so confused.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.480
'Confusion and fear
are always on the menu

04:52.560 --> 04:54.760
when the Tablet of Terror is around.'

04:54.840 --> 04:56.440
'Enjoy your lunch.'

04:56.520 --> 04:57.800
(tablet rings)

04:57.880 --> 04:59.480
(all) Oh!

04:59.560 --> 05:01.760
Ding, ding. Fuck off.

05:01.840 --> 05:05.440
"Things are really heating up
today. The beach is calling for Che,

05:05.520 --> 05:08.320
Dean and Jordan. It is time
to greet the new arrival."

05:08.400 --> 05:09.680
Oh!

05:09.760 --> 05:11.560
Oh, piss off, Tablet of Terror.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.520
I put 100 quid
on it being Dean's ex.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.520
It could be mine.
You never know with this place.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.840
You weren't worried.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.240
I wasn't, but every time,
it gets worse.(laughter)

05:21.320 --> 05:24.040
Normally, I'd be all over it
when it comes to birds.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.000
But if my ex walks out,
she's getting hoisted back in.

05:27.080 --> 05:30.640
'Big talk, Dean, but there's
plenty more exes on the way,

05:30.720 --> 05:33.480
and the only thing being thrown
will be tantrums.'

05:33.560 --> 05:36.240
'T minus one hour.'

05:44.320 --> 05:46.840
Who's nervous?
Shitting it.Shitting myself.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.320
If my ex comes out,
massive cock block.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.400
If Sydney comes in here,
she's a rocket, and I'm worried.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.560
If Sydney comes in here, she's mine.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.720
(they laugh)

05:56.800 --> 05:58.080
I'm a naughty lad.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.320
And whilst I was banging my exes,
I was squirting condiments

06:01.400 --> 06:03.800
all over a few side dishes.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.440
I am shitting myself now.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.600
I do think that the third time down
on the beach is mine.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.920
When Lee came on,
I was turned into a freak.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.640
If it's another one, I might as well
go drown myself in the sea.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.640
This could kick off.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.840
This is definitely black sand,
the sand of death. We're in hell.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.400
Beaches are meant to be nice.
This beach is an absolute shitter.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.280
Argh!

06:29.360 --> 06:32.280
"We're in hell right now.
The sand of death, mate."

06:32.360 --> 06:34.160
(laughs)

06:36.800 --> 06:40.880
'With tensions high on the beach,
the Tablet has given Max and Georgia

06:40.960 --> 06:43.400
a chance to unwind on a yoga date.'

06:43.480 --> 06:44.960
How are you?
My name is Leah.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.320
Max, nice to meet you.
I'm Georgia.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.040
'Downward dogging, anyone?'

06:49.120 --> 06:50.800
I'm excited to be here with Max.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.280
Yoga's quite intimate. We'll see
what positions we're put in.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.800
Bring him in to your body.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.200
Slipping everywhere. I like that.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.840
I nearly snapped me back.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.280
Yoga to me, I just think
is a load of bullshit.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.320
It's for people who can't play
sports and do stretching instead.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.920
We're in a weird 69'ing position.
I can see her ass.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.280
This is turning me right on.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.760
(both laugh)

07:15.840 --> 07:17.760
Oh, my God.

07:17.840 --> 07:22.000
Bend your elbow, lower your knees
down, and that's it.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.040
Yoga's like the biggest cock tease.
All it does it make you horny.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.960
This is getting so intense,
it's pretty sexual.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.320
I just wanna kiss him.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.960
...lap.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.200
Slowly, slowly
bring your feet together.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.640
Things got a little bit heated.
Georgia's sat on top of me.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.240
My rod starts poking up.
I'm thinking, "Please don't notice."

07:50.320 --> 07:53.200
(laughs)
Jesus, slow down, slow down.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.480
I'm just thinking,
"I just want him!"

07:55.560 --> 07:56.800
Slowly.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.080
It's the bit I hate.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.840
I'm literally crossing my fingers,
my toes and my balls.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.400
Jordan, do you feel it?

08:08.480 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.
Yeah.Massively.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.520
Fuck me, I'll cry if my ex
ends up coming out.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.000
Oh, my God! (laughs)

08:18.200 --> 08:22.320
I'm always playing it cool until
I'm sat on this fucking sun lounger

08:22.400 --> 08:25.240
and I start shitting myself.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.040
"Oh, my God!"

08:28.360 --> 08:30.760
"I'll cry if my ex
ends up coming out."

08:40.720 --> 08:42.280
Hi!

08:42.360 --> 08:44.920
Fuck's sake. It's me.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.720
Fucking hell, it's Stevie.
I've had a right turnout.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.320
What's your name?
Stevie.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.880
Nice to meet you. Jordan.

08:51.960 --> 08:55.960
Thank fuck it's not my ex. Who's
this rocket that's walked out?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.440
Sorry, Deano!

08:57.520 --> 08:59.640
Hi!
Hello, you all right? Stevie.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.480
Shit, it's Dean's ex.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.360
Fuck, I had big plans for tonight.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.760
What's happening?
You all right?

09:09.720 --> 09:13.160
I'm Stevie, I'm from Brighton
and I'm a fuckin ice queen.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.320
I been fucked over in the past
by every boy that I get with.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.440
Fuck me over, mug me off,
and I tell you what you will be,

09:19.520 --> 09:22.280
blocked, blocked, blocked,
blocked, blocked.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.800
I met Dean on a night out in Essex.
We were seeing each other.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.560
I went on holiday,
and he's completely stopped talking.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.080
But I fancy him still.

09:32.160 --> 09:35.160
When we were together,
we got on well, and he ghosted me,

09:35.240 --> 09:36.680
so I'm here to find out why.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.680
So, I take it, er, you two have...

09:40.760 --> 09:44.480
I was seeing him, but I went
on holiday and never heard from him.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.360
And then I went on holiday.
She was out there and she caught me.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.160
What are you here to get?

09:50.240 --> 09:51.840
You're here for me?
Yeah.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.120
Oh, this is a feisty one,
I'll tell you.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.360
Stevie is an absolute fruitcake.

09:56.440 --> 10:00.000
I ghost her, give her the elbow,
and she still wants to see me.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.280
Fucking hell.

10:01.360 --> 10:05.040
I've come here to basically ask,
what the fuck? Why did you ghost me?

10:05.120 --> 10:07.120
I don't know.
There was no reason.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.480
I'll tell you what it was.
It was moving very fast.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.800
I saw you once a week.
It weren't that fast.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.120
He mugged you off.
You're still here...?

10:15.200 --> 10:17.840
He didn't mug me off.
He's just didn't talk to me.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.840
'That's not mugging you off at all.'

10:19.920 --> 10:22.160
Good to see you, though.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.520
And you.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.080
(laughs)

10:25.160 --> 10:27.800
Stevie is an absolute bit of sauce.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.320
I'm gonna squirt it on my plate.
'Oh, Jordan.'

10:30.400 --> 10:32.160
He didn't text you back?

10:32.240 --> 10:34.200
No.
All right, Jordan, come on, bruv.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.640
Don't dig me out again.
Don't throw me under the bus again!

10:37.720 --> 10:40.400
That bus has gone over me
and reversed a few times.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.240
Not while I was driving it.
(they laugh)

10:43.320 --> 10:47.160
Jordan, you bastard, you're supposed
to put out fires, not start them!

10:47.240 --> 10:51.480
Would you be annoyed if, like,
me or any other girls got on Dean?

10:51.560 --> 10:53.560
If he gets with other people, I can.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.680
You know what? Stevie can jog on.
I think I'm in there.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.640
(tablet rings)

10:58.720 --> 11:00.880
(groaning, shouting)

11:00.960 --> 11:02.960
Tablet of Terror, you bell-end.

11:03.040 --> 11:07.840
"It's date time. Stevie and Jordan,
you're going to mix it up

11:07.920 --> 11:10.680
but will you come out
smelling like roses?"

11:10.760 --> 11:12.160
Yes! Come on!

11:12.240 --> 11:13.840
Should we get ready?
Yeah.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.240
Go on, fuck off.
Ah!

11:16.240 --> 11:18.960
Now's my chance.
I'm gonna crack right on with Che

11:19.040 --> 11:20.800
before them two get to the villa.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.200
(laughs)

11:24.400 --> 11:25.440
Keep running.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.880
When I just said to her, if I
or any of the girls got on you,

11:28.960 --> 11:31.400
she was like,
"That means I get with people."

11:31.480 --> 11:34.080
She gave you the green card, girl.
Yeah, she did.

11:34.160 --> 11:37.600
Take it and grasp it
with both hands. (laughs)

11:37.680 --> 11:40.920
While Stevie's away,
Che's gonna play.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.240
'With his third eye chakra
well and truly open,

11:44.320 --> 11:48.160
Max is keen
to get inside Georgia's... head.'

11:48.240 --> 11:50.280
I need to know,
do you wanna be with me?

11:50.360 --> 11:52.440
I don't have a fucking Scooby.

11:52.520 --> 11:54.360
I think you know I like you, Max.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.560
I wanna carry on
getting close to you.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.880
Good, it's nice to know.
I woke up this morning, thought,

11:59.960 --> 12:01.600
"Fuck this shit."
I know.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.800
Are you worried
I'd crack on with birds?

12:03.880 --> 12:05.920
That's always in
the back of my mind,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.520
but if we're gonna move forward,
me and you,

12:08.600 --> 12:11.520
and we say we're not gonna do that,
I'll trust you.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.360
I do believe Max.
I believe everything he's saying,

12:14.440 --> 12:16.720
but it's just me.
It's just my insecurity.

12:16.800 --> 12:20.440
I'll try and show you more emotion.
I'll be a bit more out there.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.680
We need to find a balance.
(laughs)

12:22.760 --> 12:26.680
I'll be a lot more open and you need
to give me a bit more attention.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.360
(laughs)
Just a little bit, just a little.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.600
I'm so happy Max is still willing
to give me a chance.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.760
I wanna be with him.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.040
Give us a kiss.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.400
If Max gives me
all the attention I need,

12:39.480 --> 12:41.920
I'm excited to see
what happens tonight.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.640
I'm absolutely buzzing
to go back to the villa.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.640
Hopefully, we can crack on.
Third time lucky.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.120
Let's get back in there
before I blow me nut.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.800
(laughs)

12:53.680 --> 12:55.520
Hello!

12:55.600 --> 12:58.240
Dean's ex, isn't it?
Your ex, Deano?

12:58.320 --> 13:01.320
My ex, Stevie.
Jordan's took her on a fucking date.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.080
(Chloe) What's her personality?
She's fiery.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.480
She's got something on her mind,
she'll say it.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.320
Is she fit?
Yeah, she's fit.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.880
You'd all fuck her.
She is.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.280
(indistinct)

13:13.360 --> 13:15.200
Yeah, baby!

13:17.080 --> 13:19.400
I got my eyes on other things.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.720
I am gunning for Che. Hopefully,
I get her in the penthouse.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.760
Oh, Che is in! (laughs)

13:25.840 --> 13:28.160
Che's my Barbie doll.
Yeah, he's my Ken.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.240
(laughter)

13:29.320 --> 13:31.800
'Aw, they really are
made for each other.'

13:32.920 --> 13:35.480
'Meanwhile,
a perfume-making date with Stevie

13:35.560 --> 13:40.800
is heaven scent for Jordan, who's
hoping he won't end up cologne.'

13:40.880 --> 13:44.000
Smells a bit boy-y. I think
the fumes are going to me head.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.280
You get high
once you're sat next to me.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.760
(both laugh)
Dickhead.

13:48.840 --> 13:53.240
Stevie is relaxed, she's chilled.
She's a fucking rocket.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.720
I actually do like that.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.160
Animalic.
Animalic.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.480
You're a fucking animal.
Yes, I am.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.280
Show me your nails.
Do you take chunks out of backs?

14:01.360 --> 14:02.480
Oh, I do.
I bet you do.

14:02.560 --> 14:06.320
'Jordan, good thing you're making
perfume, cos your chat stinks.'

14:06.400 --> 14:07.440
Sandalwood?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.760
It's, erm, quite light, creamy.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.200
(both) Creamy wood.
(both laugh)

14:12.280 --> 14:15.960
This Stevie girl is right up
my street. My kind of banter.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.880
'Don't you mean shanter?'

14:17.960 --> 14:19.720
I'll remember that one.
Leafy.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.960
Leaf it out.
(both laugh)

14:22.040 --> 14:25.520
We're getting on well. He's not
my usual type, but we'll see.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.600
Are you gonna tell me
what's been going on in the villa?

14:28.680 --> 14:29.840
Who's Dean been with?

14:29.920 --> 14:33.280
The first day on the beach
he gave Savannah the rose.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.000
Yeah.
And a little kiss.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.720
And they spent a few nights
in bed together.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.200
But they didn't bang or anything.
No, why?

14:40.280 --> 14:42.520
I think Savannah's not putting out.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.360
He would've if he could've.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.760
I'm filling Stevie in

14:45.840 --> 14:49.000
on what dirty Deano's really like.
I'm taking this off you.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.200
Dean was in bed with Savannah.
Mm.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.120
He was absolutely battered.
Right.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.600
And he weren't getting none
from Savannah,

14:57.680 --> 15:00.960
so he's crawled out of his bed
into Che's bed,

15:01.040 --> 15:03.240
gave her a cuddle.
Does Savannah know?

15:04.240 --> 15:06.360
Oh, he's such a cunt.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.840
Che's a good craic.
Yeah.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.640
Yeah, but I think she's gonna go
for Dean tonight, to be honest.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.840
Dean's been with Savannah.
Now Che wants to fuck him.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.120
He's only been here a couple days.
Dog.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.000
I've come to see what the craic is.
If he wants a two out of ten,

15:21.080 --> 15:23.440
he can fuck her.
Do you know what I mean?

15:23.520 --> 15:25.080
I'll fuck you, so...

15:25.160 --> 15:27.080
(laughs)

15:27.160 --> 15:30.200
Fingers crossed, Deano.
Get your end away, lad.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.640
Oh, look! It's Dora the Explorer.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.040
(laughter)
(Lee) How's it going?

15:39.120 --> 15:41.120
Good.
Yoga's not my strong point.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.080
Oi, Max, Dean's ex bird came in.
Yeah, Stevie.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.680
Apparently, you're her type.
(laughs)

15:46.760 --> 15:49.240
This kid is such a wind-up.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.280
It's a sticky situation.
(Marty)Georgia, your face!

15:52.360 --> 15:54.600
It's fine as long as she stays away.

15:55.880 --> 15:59.240
'Surprise, surprise,
Georgia's insecurities are back,

15:59.320 --> 16:03.720
but who'll be left feeling jealous
and jaded when the next ex arrives?'

16:06.040 --> 16:07.400
Hi!
Hi!

16:07.480 --> 16:09.560
What's happening?
Hello.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.720
This is Stevie.
Hello, you all right?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.160
'Max, Georgia's got her eye on you.'

16:15.240 --> 16:19.720
Fucking hell, did you see his face?
'So much for trusting.'

16:19.800 --> 16:21.680
Nice to meet you.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.560
Stevie, what's the deal with you now
coming here?

16:24.640 --> 16:26.880
I came here to see
what was going on, but...

16:26.960 --> 16:29.680
He's getting with someone.
What've you been told?

16:29.760 --> 16:31.640
That you've got with a few girls

16:31.720 --> 16:34.240
and that you and her are maybe...
Maybe what?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.640
Gonna shag? Gonna shag?

16:36.720 --> 16:40.640
I ain't doing anything. It's fucking
Jordan with his big wooden spoon.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.000
I'll speak...
Yeah, I'll speak with him.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.800
He's been kissing birds.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.840
Who's kissed the most birds?

16:46.920 --> 16:51.080
I've kissed the most birds.
That's not my ex bird, though.

16:51.160 --> 16:54.120
That's your ex, you still
kissed them all.She's fine.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.280
Is she, fuck.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.120
Chloe's got a heart,
but he does not give a flying fuck.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.800
Demolition Deano. He's been
on every bird in here.Probably.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.880
(laughs) I haven't.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.680
Coming from you, Marty, you literally
hump anything with a pulse.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.200
I think I love her.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.400
Marty's being a fucking prick again.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.800
Look at this.
He's such a fucking bastard.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.800
Anybody that comes in,
Marty's like a fly to shit.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.599
I love it all.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.440
I could actually see her
being Mrs Mac one day.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.640
You said that
about single every bird.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.240
What the fuck, man?!

17:29.320 --> 17:30.960
Oh, fucking turn it in.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.800
Do you wanna see the villa?
Yeah.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.800
He's not gonna show you about.
(shouting)

17:35.880 --> 17:38.800
You can sit down.
I'll show you about.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.680
Jordan, this is so embarrassing.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.280
You've had to throw me
under the bus again,

17:43.360 --> 17:45.280
just to get in Stevie's knickers.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.360
(Dean) Needy Nigel. (laughs)

17:47.440 --> 17:49.040
I don't think Dean's happy.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.680
Of course he's not.
He's not.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.880
He's a snake, mate.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.080
'With the living room
ablaze with agg,

17:54.160 --> 17:57.080
firefighter Jordan
has taken Stevie to the bathroom

17:57.160 --> 17:59.600
to... polish his helmet?'

17:59.680 --> 18:01.960
Oh, go on, girl!
Magic fingers.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.680
Get your hands involved.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.040
If you do that too much,
you're gonna make the shag go funny.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.400
It's fine.
But if you hold that. Look.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.640
You've made it go...

18:13.720 --> 18:16.160
(hairdryer turns on)

18:16.240 --> 18:18.600
Well, this is fun.
Don't hold it like that.

18:23.280 --> 18:26.760
'After all that, Jordan, you've
gotta be clean as a whistle.'

18:27.960 --> 18:30.640
Talk of the devil.
Oh, me ears are burning.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.960
What're we talking about?
You're a snake.

18:33.040 --> 18:36.000
You ain't gotta
throw me under the bus.Who?You.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.600
She said, "Has he done anything?"
I told her.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.880
Why would you do that? I'm your pal!
I just told her the truth.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.760
We all agreed...
(Marty)What a lovely girl she is.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.040
No way would I dog you in
the meantime.How have I dogged you?

18:48.120 --> 18:51.360
He's thrown you under the bus
to make it easy to kiss her.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.400
Oh, fuck yourself, Marty.
Very two-faced.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.440
Everyone's having a go at Jordan.
I can't understand.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.240
He's only told me the truth.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.880
Jordan, you couldn't crack her
fairly, so you tried to do it dirty.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.360
I've said you and me can talk
and whatever happens, happens.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.080
We don't need to talk.
He's told you everything.

19:09.160 --> 19:12.200
Why are you getting aggy with me?
I'm not getting aggy.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.200
You are. Your nostrils are flaring.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.680
'Nostrils aren't the only thing
flaring up

19:16.760 --> 19:20.680
as Georgia's insecurities
are back with a vengeance.'

19:20.760 --> 19:24.040
Max, I'm pissed off at you.
You're having eyes with her.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.840
She comes in
and you haven't looked at me since.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.560
Oh, my God.
You haven't.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.440
Max, you haven't.
There's gonna be a lot more girls.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.560
Are you gonna be like this
every time?

19:33.640 --> 19:36.800
I like to feel like I'm wanted.
Tonight I haven't felt that.

19:36.880 --> 19:40.880
I've done nothing
to kind of say (indistinct). Nowt.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.200
Why am I in the wrong?

19:43.480 --> 19:44.840
Stop it.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.920
I can't stick my tongue up your ass.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.840
Can I get involved in this, please?

19:51.920 --> 19:53.600
What has it got to do with you?

19:53.680 --> 19:55.720
Basically,
Georgia's pulled me aside

19:55.800 --> 19:58.800
and said I've been staring
at the new girl all night.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.920
(groans) Oh, my God!

20:01.000 --> 20:04.080
With Georgia, you're banging
your head against a wall.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.360
She will not listen.

20:05.440 --> 20:09.120
I'm not being nasty, but it's the
biggest turnoff that you said that.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.800
What'd she say?
Well, be turned off.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.120
She's gorgeous.
Who wouldn't look at her?

20:14.200 --> 20:17.440
I've not been staring at her.
Exactly. But since she's come,

20:17.520 --> 20:20.280
you haven't looked at me.
You want me to stare at you?

20:20.360 --> 20:22.160
Yeah, that's all.
Shit, listen.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.320
Can you be arsed with that
all the time?

20:24.400 --> 20:26.160
No, I can't.
That's it.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.280
If you can't be arsed with it...

20:28.360 --> 20:30.800
Don't say,
"Can you be arsed with that?"

20:30.880 --> 20:34.960
That situation is fucking balls,
mate.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.200
(babbles)

20:36.280 --> 20:38.480
Marty makes it 100 times worse.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.200
If anyone should be insecure,
it should be him.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.360
He should be cos of what I've done.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.480
I'm insecure because of how I am.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.920
She's fucking mental.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.160
I'm the victim here. I'm not allowed
to look at a new person.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.360
I am not having this.
You are, Max.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.480
Georgia knows how I feel. I told
her. I don't need to go over it.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.800
It's her problem, not mine.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.960
'So, here's an idea for a game.'

21:02.040 --> 21:05.840
'Manhandle people into an ascending
order of personal preference,

21:05.920 --> 21:10.520
based solely on their looks,
and call it "Shit to Fit".'

21:10.600 --> 21:12.600
'Oh, this'll go great.'

21:13.640 --> 21:14.840
Curve ball.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.240
(laughter)
Really?

21:16.320 --> 21:18.480
That's the order, I think.
You done?

21:18.560 --> 21:21.120
I'm gonna always think
my ex is the best looking.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.200
Hey! (indistinct)

21:23.280 --> 21:25.600
But my ex thinks I'm the ugliest.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.760
She was full of fucking shit.
I actually didn't say nowt.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.760
I've just put you fucking first!
Why would you say that?

21:38.840 --> 21:40.720
Fuck off and get away from us.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.240
I've just put you first.
Are you joking us?

21:43.320 --> 21:45.960
Chloe can push my buttons
better than anyone.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.840
She can say one little thing,

21:47.920 --> 21:51.400
and it can make me blow up more than
anything in the fucking world.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.560
Because I've known him six years,
he always chooses other girls,

22:09.640 --> 22:13.480
all the new girls, over me. I feel
like he thinks they're prettier.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.320
None of the girls in here are you,
Chloe.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.080
I just want to move on.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.640
Like, I am so sick
of being in this situation.

22:29.720 --> 22:32.720
I wanna move on!
I am sick of feeling like this.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.920
(groans) It's a head fuck.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.800
I don't like it.
I don't like being head fucked.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.520
She's out there crying her eyes out
thinking you think she's ugly.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.800
She's playing the victim.
She knew what she was doing.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.880
My head has fucking gone.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.080
I don't know. She thinks that.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.960
Have I said that?
I'm asking you.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.040
Have I, fuck!

22:54.120 --> 22:56.120
Why is Marty starting on Chloe?

22:56.200 --> 22:59.160
It's pissing me off.
I can't stand the kid's attitude.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.680
I don't know.
Exactly.I'm not saying you did.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.320
I telling you, I haven't.
I didn't say anything.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.720
She's out there crying
a fucking victim, so think of that.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.400
I'm seeing fucking red now.

23:09.480 --> 23:12.320
There's no stopping me.
I'm gonna kick clean off.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.720
Fuck!

23:23.120 --> 23:26.240
Everyone's having a go at me.
It's turned us fucking mad.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.920
Get the fuck away from me.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.240
(indistinct shouting)

23:49.160 --> 23:50.280
Is he all right?

23:54.360 --> 23:57.760
Marty volleyed the fuck
out of the pool swan. (laughs)

23:57.840 --> 24:01.640
(Chloe) That's my ex. That's my ex,
it's embarrassing.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.520
Fuck off! Fuck off!

24:04.600 --> 24:06.200
You're embarrassing me!

24:06.280 --> 24:09.800
You try and shag everyone
in this villa, man! Fuck off!

24:09.880 --> 24:13.760
I can't fucking stand everyone
in this villa.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.080
I've never seen anything like this.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.880
This villa is a fucking madhouse.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.800
'As Marty hits everything in sight,

24:21.880 --> 24:24.520
Jordan's busy hitting on Stevie.'

24:28.480 --> 24:32.120
I didn't think I was gonna come here
and find someone else, and I have.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.360
Fucking hell,
you two have some balls doing that

24:38.440 --> 24:40.760
when that's happening.
(they laugh)

24:42.400 --> 24:44.640
'With passions running high
in the villa,

24:44.720 --> 24:49.120
who will find it too hot to handle
when the next ex arrives?'

24:49.200 --> 24:51.440
(evil laugh)

24:53.120 --> 24:57.000
I've never ever met a girl like you.
It's crazy.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.320
I can't get over that a bird's
walked in and I can't look at her.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.760
I'm sorry.
No.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.800
I'm not saying
you can't look at her.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.880
We're are never, ever gonna work.
I know.Ever.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.080
I feel the same.
We're never gonna work.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.560
Is that what you want?
Yeah, it ridic... It's scary.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.840
Right, well,
we know the situation, so...

25:17.920 --> 25:20.920
What situation? You tell me.
We're done?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.560
I can't deal with this.
OK.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.560
I cannot carry on...
That's fine.

25:24.640 --> 25:27.320
It's been a full three days of it.
I know, it's fine.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.120
It has been three days here.

25:32.400 --> 25:36.080
I had to end things. The girl was
sending me absolutely stir crazy.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.440
I was gonna leave
in a straightjacket.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.800
I'm not gonna ruin
my time in here.

25:40.880 --> 25:44.600
I wanna crack on with fit birds,
and Georgia was gonna hold me back.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.080
It's all fucking kicked off again
last night,

25:58.160 --> 26:00.200
and I see it as
the perfect opportunity

26:00.280 --> 26:02.120
to sneak up to that penthouse.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.520
I'm kind of glad
I didn't get anything,

26:04.600 --> 26:08.000
because I was a little bit worried
that if she went for the cock,

26:08.080 --> 26:09.200
it would erupt.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.840
Today, I'm gonna put all my eggs
in Stevie's basket,

26:12.920 --> 26:15.320
and hopefully one of them
fucking hatches.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.480
I woken up
and I do feel a little bit bad.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.920
I come to see what
could happen with Dean.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.280
I wasn't getting nice vibes from him
and ended up with Jordan.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.040
It wasn't intentional, but...

26:25.120 --> 26:29.880
Although me and Jordan are getting
on well, I do need to speak to Dean.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.760
My plan was to crack on with Che,

26:34.840 --> 26:38.160
but a lot went down, and I got
caught in the firing line. Again.

26:38.240 --> 26:41.360
I definitely wouldn't wifey Che,
but I'd love to bang her.

26:41.440 --> 26:44.720
She is a bit of a sort at the end
of the day. I think she goes.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.920
Dean is a bit of meat.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.160
I don't see Stevie as a friend.
Don't owe her fuck all.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.160
My to-do list tonight... bang him.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.880
I thought it'd be really good
to crack on with Georgia,

27:00.960 --> 27:02.920
but when she's going on
like she is,

27:03.000 --> 27:06.720
she's a nightmare. That's why
we never worked. I need to move on.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.520
Last night was an absolute mess.

27:08.600 --> 27:12.080
I'm gutted that things aren't
gonna work, but that's how it is.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.760
I'm so bored of being angry
with Marty after all these years.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.160
I just don't understand.
I'm confused.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.760
Like, this is why me and Marty
haven't worked,

27:21.840 --> 27:24.800
I've been hurt because he just
chooses any random girl.

27:24.880 --> 27:26.520
What's wrong with me?

27:26.600 --> 27:28.240
I've woke up and thought,

27:28.320 --> 27:31.280
I'm never gonna be friends
with Chloe ever again.

27:31.360 --> 27:35.720
She was trying to wind us up. Best
friends don't do that. She is done.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.840
I fancy Savannah.
I wanna start grafting her.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.920
'With the villa all at sea,
the Tablet of Terror has shown mercy

27:48.000 --> 27:50.160
and sent everyone on a boat party!'

27:50.240 --> 27:52.200
'Anchors aweigh!'

27:53.320 --> 27:54.680
Go party! Whoo!

27:54.760 --> 27:56.360
(cheering)

28:06.560 --> 28:09.240
(Marty) This boat party's
going fucking off!

28:09.320 --> 28:12.120
There's birds pouring champagne
on their titties.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.600
Give us a lick of your nip.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.880
'Sounds like a banging party,
Marty.'

28:16.960 --> 28:21.160
'Perfect time for Stevie to take Dean
starboard for a heart-to-heart.'

28:21.240 --> 28:24.600
When I was seeing you, I did,
you know, I really liked you.Yeah.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.600
But you didn't do anything,

28:26.680 --> 28:30.840
apart from just... (chuckles)
...never speak to me again.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.080
Oh!

28:32.160 --> 28:34.160
It was a dick move by you.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.040
It was a massive dick move,
and I apologise for that.

28:37.120 --> 28:40.120
I come in here to see what
could happen between me and you,

28:40.200 --> 28:42.800
but I just wanna know
what the situation is.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.960
It's just a bit weird. You said,
"I've come here for you."

28:46.040 --> 28:48.240
You shared the penthouse
with Jordan.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.840
I do really like Jordan,

28:49.920 --> 28:53.400
but my feelings for Dean are
making it hard for me to move on.

28:53.480 --> 28:56.520
I'm not gonna crack on with you
if you're not interested.

28:56.600 --> 29:00.360
You didn't know if I was.
Well, I haven't asked.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.320
It's hard now. You've jumped
in the bed with Jordan.

29:03.400 --> 29:07.600
If you felt like you was coming here
to make something work with me,

29:07.680 --> 29:09.240
you wouldn't have done that.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.160
Yeah, I do get that.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.680
I can't believe
Stevie's got feelings for me.

29:13.760 --> 29:17.040
The last thing I'm here for
is a relationship. I wanna bang.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.920
I've got my eyes on Che.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.720
Is there anyone you like?

29:25.400 --> 29:27.280
No, there's not. There's not.
No?

29:27.360 --> 29:30.920
OK. I do feel like you're
beating around the bush, though.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.360
And you're not saying what you feel.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.240
I am sorry for how I treated you.
I really am.I know.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.840
That was naughty.

29:37.920 --> 29:42.000
We're just gonna have to see how you
and Jordan get on and how we get on

29:42.080 --> 29:44.760
and just... I don't know.
You never know.No.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.040
Cheers.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.200
Me being around Dean today
made me realise

29:51.280 --> 29:55.480
I might have a second chance, so I
need to leave it there with Jordan.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.800
I come in here to get over Marty,

30:08.880 --> 30:11.360
but I need to see
what's actually going on.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.880
I wanna start by saying
sorry for last night.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.440
I shouldn't have went on
the way I did.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.840
I should've, me being your friend,

30:18.920 --> 30:22.560
I should've been there for you
when you're in that situation.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.720
Chloe last night was a pure divvy.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.840
When I'm pissed, she should calm us.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.440
I don't understand how you say
we're best pals.

30:30.520 --> 30:35.280
When I'm angry, you shouting stuff
at me. It's made us worse.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.600
You know I've known you
for six years.

30:37.680 --> 30:41.560
I've always had something for you.
It's always the same shit, Marty.

30:41.640 --> 30:45.360
You've got these random girls,
who you've known six seconds,

30:45.440 --> 30:48.880
maybe even seven,
and you're like, "Wow, fit, her!"

30:48.960 --> 30:51.760
"Marriage material,
I wanna get on her."

30:51.840 --> 30:54.760
You're that much of a friend,
then why do that?

30:54.840 --> 30:58.440
I obviously didn't mean it.
These birds, I wanna shag them.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.480
She thinks I'm gonna get on one
knee and pull a ring out.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.200
I really don't know
if I wanna be friends with you.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.840
What do you want to happen?
I don't know, Marty.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.720
I don't know what's going on.

31:10.800 --> 31:15.120
I'm sick of being like this
every single time with you. (cries)

31:15.200 --> 31:17.520
Stop it. Stop crying, man.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.240
It's not nice for me
coming in this villa

31:21.320 --> 31:24.000
and having all these
fucking skinny girls...

31:24.080 --> 31:25.680
Listen! Listen, right,

31:25.760 --> 31:30.320
cos I'm so sick of coming here
and girls coming every single day.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.520
It's not helping,
you saying that everyone's fit.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.520
You're flirting with every girl,
and I've gotta watch.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.640
You say we're friends. Have respect.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.520
Yeah, Chloe, I'll try and respect
you as much I can,

31:41.600 --> 31:44.120
but I'm thinking
I wanna kiss every fucker.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.680
So, what do you wanna do then?
I don't know.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.280
Maybe stop flirting.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.720
I don't think we can.
It's just natural.

31:50.800 --> 31:55.000
Listen, come here, give us a cuddle.
Now, can we focus on being friends?

31:55.080 --> 31:56.680
Now I've got that off me chest,

31:56.760 --> 31:59.280
hopefully Marty listens
to what I'm saying

31:59.360 --> 32:01.600
and he doesn't flirt with birds
in me face.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.000
'Well, you have to admire
her optimism.'

32:04.080 --> 32:07.200
'Not that the Tablet of Terror
cares much for hope.'

32:07.280 --> 32:08.560
(tablet rings)

32:08.640 --> 32:10.200
(groaning)

32:10.280 --> 32:11.880
Tablet of Terror, piss off.

32:11.960 --> 32:15.560
"It's date time. You've been starved
of romance so far,

32:15.640 --> 32:18.400
so, Che and Dean, prepare to knock."

32:18.480 --> 32:19.720
(shouting)

32:19.800 --> 32:21.040
For fuck's sake.

32:21.120 --> 32:24.040
It's my third date.
You never know, third time lucky.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.480
Me and Che, on a date.
What a touch. Let's get it on.

32:27.560 --> 32:30.120
I trust Che.
I don't think anything will happen.

32:30.200 --> 32:33.440
I don't think she'd sleep with him.
(Fatima shouts)

32:34.560 --> 32:37.640
I think Che won't go there,
but I know how sly girls can be.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.640
I class her as one of my mates now.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.640
"I trust Che."
You've known her five minutes.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.600
In our time in the villa,

32:44.680 --> 32:47.600
I think me and Dean's had one
one-on-one conversation.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.720
So, we'll see how the date goes.
(Chloe) Ooh!

32:50.800 --> 32:53.440
'Oh, Stevie, ye of too much faith.'

32:54.440 --> 32:55.920
Hi.
You all right?

32:59.240 --> 33:00.880
The settings is beautiful.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.960
It literally couldn't get
any nicer or more romantic.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.800
Nice, innit?
Yes.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.920
'Ooh, great start, Deano.'

33:08.000 --> 33:09.240
Shit. (laughs)

33:09.320 --> 33:13.240
Thank fuck I've got Che away from
everyone. The girl is turning me on.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.480
It's a bit awkward that

33:15.560 --> 33:19.360
when we finally start to crack on,
your ex is here.

33:19.440 --> 33:24.000
And today, when she said,
"No, it's fine, I trust Che",

33:24.080 --> 33:27.160
I was like, "Ooh..."
Was that your impression?Yeah.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.400
Che keeps on rattling on
about Stevie.

33:29.480 --> 33:32.720
She said this, she said that.
I couldn't give a flying fuck.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.320
Che, babe, all I wanna do
is get my hands on you.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.520
I don't get why she'd say,
"I see her as one of my friends."

33:38.600 --> 33:43.160
I barely spoke to her today, so it's
like she's doing that to cock block.

33:43.240 --> 33:47.480
But not gonna work well, is it?
(laughs) I don't know, you tell me.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.880
Do you like your wine?
The wine is lovely.

33:49.960 --> 33:53.040
The food's lovely.
The company's even better.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.000
I want to fuck Dean. (laughs)

34:00.360 --> 34:03.160
So, it's all go from here.
I've got the green light?

34:03.240 --> 34:04.640
Yeah.
Sweet.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.640
This steak tastes even better now.
(laughs)

34:07.720 --> 34:09.400
I don't give a shit about exes.

34:09.480 --> 34:13.320
If I want to do something, I'm going
to do something, or someone.

34:13.400 --> 34:17.040
First to get in here, and we've not
banged yet. It doesn't make sense.

34:17.120 --> 34:20.440
You've been playing hard to get.
It's worked, hasn't it?

34:20.520 --> 34:22.719
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. (laughs)

34:22.800 --> 34:24.719
The only way for me
to go about this,

34:24.800 --> 34:26.840
is play it cool,
back to the villa,

34:26.920 --> 34:30.280
do the deed, fuck everyone else.
Let's get it on.

34:30.360 --> 34:34.600
'Away from the best-looking
and most modest couple in the villa,

34:34.679 --> 34:38.440
doesn't-know-he's-been-pied Jordan
seems confident of his chances

34:38.520 --> 34:40.000
in the penthouse.'

34:40.080 --> 34:43.120
How are things with you and Stevie?
She's wicked, mate.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.199
She's a good chick.
She's wicked.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.960
She's stunning
and she's got good craic.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.520
By far the best craic in here.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.520
Her ass is decent as well.
She's got a great ass.

34:53.600 --> 34:57.000
Love to play a tune on that.
(laughs) Yeah!

34:57.080 --> 35:00.040
(trumpets)
With any luck, mate. (laughs)

35:00.120 --> 35:02.400
Stevie is the total opposite
of Georgia.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.600
She's a bird with banter,
and she's sexy as fuck.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.120
I'm gonna flirt with her
and see what she says.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.680
(laughs)

35:09.760 --> 35:12.640
I'm never gonna say...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:12.720 --> 35:13.720
She's into us.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.040
I know who she's really going for,
me.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.560
Trust me.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.640
'Poor Jordan,
you've really got no idea.'

35:22.720 --> 35:26.400
'And luckily for Marty, Chloe's
still unaware of him and Sav.'

35:26.480 --> 35:29.480
I wanna full-time kiss you
all the time, just me and you.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.960
(laughs)

35:31.040 --> 35:34.040
Shut up. Stop saying you're gonna
(indistinct).

35:34.120 --> 35:35.720
I really like Marty,

35:35.800 --> 35:39.640
but at the same time, I know it's
probably the worst thing I could do.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.160
Not in front of anyone.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.000
Because it's not fair.
It's not fair.

35:53.080 --> 35:56.880
You can't be that bothered
about Chloe. You keep kissing us.

36:04.160 --> 36:07.720
It's so naughty. I feel so bad.
I feel like I'm a bad person.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.720
No, no it's proper tight.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.000
It's proper tight.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.480
Kissing Marty feels so wrong.
If Chloe found out,

36:16.560 --> 36:18.600
I feel like
she'd be really angry at me,

36:18.680 --> 36:21.360
so the last thing I wanna do
is let her know.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.840
'With danger kisses on his mind,

36:24.920 --> 36:27.600
Marty's starting the sex position
game tonight.'

36:27.680 --> 36:29.000
Nice one!

36:30.280 --> 36:32.200
'But with Chloe.'

36:32.280 --> 36:34.560
(fake moaning)

36:36.040 --> 36:39.160
'Well, the whole just being friends
thing is working.'

36:39.240 --> 36:41.520
Do I keep watching or do I stop?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.840
Thanks for that! There's the taxi!

36:43.920 --> 36:47.040
That was ten. That was ten.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.600
Who's next then?

36:48.680 --> 36:52.920
Go on, Jord. You and Stevie.
Jordan and Stevie.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.520
Jordan and Stevie are next up
on the table.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.400
This is so fucking awkward.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.760
In my mind,
I'm thinking about Dean.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.240
You can go first.
You pick how you want it.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.840
Go on, just get on. Go on.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.360
It's not really fair for me
to be stringing Jordan along.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.920
No, you, come on.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.760
(all) Ooh...

37:15.840 --> 37:17.680
Fucking hell!

37:17.760 --> 37:19.240
OK!

37:19.320 --> 37:21.280
I'm in there.
OK.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.600
Fucking hell,
how does that pie taste?

37:23.680 --> 37:25.920
Jordan looks fucking devastated.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.280
Jump ship.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.880
Jump ship.
(Marty)Jordan looks devastated.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.120
(Stevie) Go on, then.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.720
Jordan, don't get jealous, Jord.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.280
Oh, Jordan!

37:35.360 --> 37:40.120
Oh, you should've Jordan's face!
Fucking hell, man! Ah!

37:42.440 --> 37:45.400
Jordan! Jordan is jealous!

37:46.640 --> 37:48.960
(laughter)

37:50.400 --> 37:53.480
Right, Max, you are the shittest
shag I have ever seen.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.400
(woman) Hi!

38:00.680 --> 38:02.960
Ooh, it's boyfriend and girlfriend.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.800
They're holding hands!

38:07.560 --> 38:10.120
They walk in holding hands.
He's smirking,

38:10.200 --> 38:12.440
looking at me,
thinks he's the bollocks.

38:12.520 --> 38:16.120
I'm tired, so I'm gonna go to bed,
and she's coming with me.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.160
(shouting)

38:18.240 --> 38:19.760
Are you fucking serious?

38:19.840 --> 38:22.720
Are you going straight up?
It's been a long day.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.280
We'll talk about it at breakfast.
Yes, Deano!

38:27.440 --> 38:30.960
They've come in, gone to the
penthouse. Well, he's fucked it now.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.680
They're gonna shag, trust us.
They won't.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.760
She wouldn't even look at me.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.480
They will.
Why are they going there otherwise?

38:38.560 --> 38:40.480
She's a two-faced little bitch.

38:40.560 --> 38:43.040
I looked at her.
She looked everywhere but me.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.720
She's a fucking sly cunt.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.360
She knows she's in the wrong.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.520
(heavy breathing)

39:01.120 --> 39:02.480
(both laugh)
