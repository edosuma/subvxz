01:02.970 --> 01:04.720
Hey.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.510
I'm sorry,
am I bothering you?

01:07.510 --> 01:09.930
No, Count Mildrew.
I'm just...

01:09.930 --> 01:11.470
Mourning
the loss of your mother?

01:11.470 --> 01:12.930
I understand.

01:12.930 --> 01:14.670
It's been a hard week,
but I'm--

01:14.670 --> 01:15.930
There's
no need to be strong.

01:15.930 --> 01:17.170
Deal with your feelings.

01:17.170 --> 01:19.800
We will handle
everything else.

01:19.800 --> 01:24.510
Uh, Princess?
Uh, I mean, Queen Moon?

01:24.510 --> 01:26.880
There's a... a situation...

01:26.880 --> 01:29.720
in the...
in the situation room.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.760
I swear it wasn't my orders!

01:32.970 --> 01:34.880
You shut up during
your confession!

01:34.880 --> 01:36.720
Mina.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.300
What is going on?

01:45.260 --> 01:47.170
What is going on?

01:47.170 --> 01:49.300
According
to this dingus here,

01:49.300 --> 01:51.800
one of his mooks
lammed-off
with half an army,

01:51.800 --> 01:54.760
and they're the ones
who put your mama
in a wooden nightgown.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.170
Ya know, they, uh...

01:56.170 --> 01:57.800
They put her on ice.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.630
Uh, drapes down in funtown.

01:59.630 --> 02:01.630
Thank you, Mina.

02:01.630 --> 02:03.510
Sorry about your mama.

02:03.510 --> 02:05.630
The queen and I were
about to sign a peace treaty

02:05.630 --> 02:07.510
when one
of my generals went rogue.

02:07.510 --> 02:08.630
Rogue wha

02:08.630 --> 02:11.970
He's known as... The Lizard.

02:11.970 --> 02:13.590
Sorry. "The Lizard"

02:13.590 --> 02:15.880
-Dude, don't laugh.
-Shut it, both of you!

02:15.880 --> 02:18.260
Put this guy in the caboose
and let's croak those toads!

02:18.260 --> 02:19.970
I think we should go to war!

02:19.970 --> 02:21.510
Now is not the time.

02:21.510 --> 02:23.380
And her magic isn't strong
enough for war yet.

02:23.380 --> 02:25.170
Especially
against the lizards.

02:25.170 --> 02:26.340
They're indestructible.

02:26.340 --> 02:27.880
We need to go to war!

02:27.880 --> 02:29.800
We need
to sign the peace treaty!

02:29.800 --> 02:31.340
Yelling feels
really good right now!

02:33.340 --> 02:35.840
Maybe
we should let Moon decide?

02:35.840 --> 02:38.840
She is the Queen.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.760
She just lost
her mother, River.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.300
She needs time
with her feelings.

02:46.760 --> 02:51.380
I am the queen now,
so I will make the decision.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.340
My decision...

02:54.340 --> 02:56.590
is that I will
make a decision at dawn.

02:59.010 --> 03:02.220
Ugh. Why did I say
"decision" so many times?

03:02.220 --> 03:05.010
Queen Moon! I'm sorry
I spoke out of place.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.550
I got you something.

03:06.550 --> 03:08.930
Uh... what is this?

03:08.930 --> 03:10.130
It's an apology meat.

03:10.130 --> 03:12.380
It's how
we Johanssons apologize.

03:12.380 --> 03:14.970
It was a relief to know
someone believed in me.

03:14.970 --> 03:16.340
Thank you.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.880
Hey! Anytime, pal!

03:18.880 --> 03:21.170
Did I just call
the queen "pal"?

03:22.760 --> 03:27.260
Ugh! Oh, apology meat,
what am I going to do?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.930
Oh, Glossy,
are you okay?

03:36.930 --> 03:39.260
No!

03:39.260 --> 03:40.630
Your mama's gone!

03:41.800 --> 03:42.970
I know.

03:42.970 --> 03:45.550
And she's
never coming back!

03:47.340 --> 03:48.970
No, she isn't.

03:48.970 --> 03:51.340
And I really liked her, too.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.630
I know you're upset--
so am I--

03:53.630 --> 03:55.880
but, right now,
I really need your help.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.630
Things are bad.

03:57.630 --> 04:00.590
I-- I have to decide
between signing
a peace treaty

04:00.590 --> 04:01.720
or waging a war.

04:01.720 --> 04:02.930
Oh, yeah...

04:02.930 --> 04:04.510
that.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.090
I don't know, just pick one.

04:06.090 --> 04:07.170
Sure it'll work out.

04:07.170 --> 04:08.760
That's not helpful at all.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.880
Yeah, you're probably right.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.970
I'm in no condition
to give advice.

04:12.970 --> 04:16.630
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go cry
in your mama's chapter.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.340
Eclypsa's
been crystalized
for hundreds of years.

04:26.340 --> 04:29.510
I've got no idea what's gonna
happen when we open this up.

04:29.510 --> 04:31.170
I can handle it.

04:36.300 --> 04:39.050
Hoo. Okay, I'm out.

04:39.050 --> 04:40.670
Call if you need me.

04:51.340 --> 04:53.430
Oh, my gosh,
I killed her!

04:53.430 --> 04:56.760
B... 4.

04:56.760 --> 04:57.880
What?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.760
B... 4

05:00.760 --> 05:02.220
"Before"?

05:02.220 --> 05:03.930
Before what?

05:03.930 --> 05:05.340
B...

05:05.340 --> 05:06.760
4.

05:09.590 --> 05:13.630
Oh, wait.
You want the candy?

05:13.630 --> 05:16.170
B4, B4, B4, B4!

05:16.170 --> 05:18.130
O...kay.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.050
Aah!

05:34.930 --> 05:36.760
Mmm mmm mmm!

05:36.760 --> 05:39.470
How long have I been here?

05:39.470 --> 05:42.800
Uh, like, 300 years.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.840
300 years?

05:51.840 --> 05:54.880
So, you're the new queen?

05:54.880 --> 05:56.930
Yes, what of it?

05:56.930 --> 06:00.880
Well, it's just
you're far too young
to be queen, unless...

06:00.880 --> 06:01.840
Oh, no.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.300
Unless, your mother,
is she...?

06:06.170 --> 06:07.800
I see.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.930
I lost my mother, too,
when I was not
much older than you.

06:11.930 --> 06:15.590
Ever since Mom...
um, since I became queen,

06:15.590 --> 06:17.840
everybody's
been looking to me
to end the war

06:17.840 --> 06:19.630
and make all
these big decisions,

06:19.630 --> 06:21.090
but I'm just a kid!

06:21.090 --> 06:23.170
I can't decide
the fate of Mewni!

06:23.170 --> 06:25.510
I can't even decide
which boy I like!

06:25.510 --> 06:27.130
I know how you feel.

06:27.130 --> 06:29.430
But that's
not why I'm here.

06:29.430 --> 06:33.630
I need you to teach me
one of the spells from
your Forbidden Chapter.

06:33.630 --> 06:36.090
Forbidden? Is that what
they're calling my chapter?

06:36.090 --> 06:38.630
Yeah, sorry,
I didn't name it.

06:38.630 --> 06:40.380
But the point is
I need a spell

06:40.380 --> 06:42.970
that can destroy something
that's immortal.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.470
Are you sure
that's what you want?

06:46.470 --> 06:48.590
It's my only hope.

06:48.590 --> 06:52.010
Well, the spell you seek
requires a magical contract.

06:52.010 --> 06:53.970
I can give it to you,

06:53.970 --> 06:55.760
but once your enemy
is killed,

06:55.760 --> 06:58.670
you must give me
something in return.

06:58.670 --> 07:01.880
Okay, what do you want?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.760
My freedom.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.970
What?

07:04.970 --> 07:06.760
Oh, I know
it's a lot to ask.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.220
But I've
just been here so long.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.590
All by myself.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.300
I want to buy
my own chocolate.

07:12.300 --> 07:16.130
Or those little
shrink-wrapped muffins
at the bottom. Mm!

07:16.130 --> 07:18.340
But these are
Rhombulus' crystals.

07:18.340 --> 07:20.050
I can't free you.

07:20.050 --> 07:23.760
A contract
between two queens is
stronger than any crystal.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.550
Now, do you want
to learn the spell?

07:38.630 --> 07:40.720
Come close. Now...

07:43.050 --> 07:47.760
And aim it directly
at his heart.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.550
What was that for?

07:49.550 --> 07:50.800
I'm just doing my job,
Your Majesty.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.430
Evil queen,
gotta freeze it.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.880
She didn't seem so evil.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.380
The queen is late.

07:57.380 --> 07:58.470
Look!

08:02.010 --> 08:04.260
She's gone mad
with grief!

08:04.260 --> 08:05.930
She was so young!

08:07.260 --> 08:08.970
She's not dead yet,
you fool!

08:37.930 --> 08:41.800
Uh, can we help you?

08:41.800 --> 08:43.840
I wish to speak
to the general.

08:46.840 --> 08:47.880
Silence!

09:02.800 --> 09:05.130
Hello, Princess.

09:05.130 --> 09:08.130
I presume you're the one
they call "The Lizard"?

09:08.130 --> 09:10.050
Yes,
but you may call me...

09:10.050 --> 09:11.430
Toffee.

09:11.430 --> 09:14.010
Toffee?
How is that any better?

09:14.010 --> 09:15.590
What do you want?

09:15.590 --> 09:17.880
I want you and your army
to leave immediately,

09:17.880 --> 09:20.260
or face the consequences.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.340
Your mom couldn't defeat us,
and neither can you!

09:23.340 --> 09:25.430
I was hoping you'd say that.

09:28.010 --> 09:30.380
We're not afraid
of your little girl magic!

09:30.380 --> 09:33.300
We're invincible!
Just watch!

09:33.300 --> 09:34.760
No, wait!
I already know about the--

09:34.760 --> 09:35.760
-Ugh!

09:43.800 --> 09:46.510
I call the darkness unto me.

09:46.510 --> 09:49.130
From deepest depths
of earth and sea.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.970
From ancient evils unawoken,

09:53.970 --> 09:56.010
break the one
that can't be broken.

09:59.510 --> 10:01.550
To blackest night,
I pledge my soul

10:01.550 --> 10:03.880
and crush my heart
to burning coal.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.430
To summon forth
a deathly power,

10:06.430 --> 10:07.840
to see
my hated foe devoured.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.380
Aah!

10:09.380 --> 10:10.970
Enough of this.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.090
Have you learned nothing?

10:36.010 --> 10:37.970
It's not growing back!

10:50.590 --> 10:52.510
Queen Moon!
You did it!

10:52.510 --> 10:53.800
Oh, my gosh! River!

10:53.800 --> 10:55.720
Thank you.

10:55.720 --> 10:59.590
What did you just do?

10:59.590 --> 11:01.760
I did my job!

11:01.760 --> 11:04.590
And as your queen,
I will continue to do my job

11:04.590 --> 11:06.300
of protecting this kingdom.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.930
I will hunt down
the remains
of the monster army

11:08.930 --> 11:12.800
and scatter them
without country
or leadership.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.260
Now, are there any questions?

11:17.880 --> 11:19.720
I didn't think so.
