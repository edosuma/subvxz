05:13.413 --> 05:14.649
What is that?

05:15.783 --> 05:16.551
Blood?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.587
What is that box?

05:19.620 --> 05:20.788
"Do not open"?

05:28.162 --> 05:29.931
Holy fuck, it smells!

05:38.940 --> 05:40.107
What?

05:41.108 --> 05:46.113
Fuck, where are the lights?

06:02.495 --> 06:03.731
Welcome back.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.984
Pretty,
pretty thing.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.852
All innocent in white.

07:33.287 --> 07:37.258
Don't you wish to join the
creatures of the night?

07:38.960 --> 07:41.395
They say you should be good,

07:41.429 --> 07:45.232
and they tie you up in rules,

07:45.266 --> 07:50.204
but your mommy didn't have
you by being a good girl.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.606
Ignore that.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.641
Thou shalt not.

07:54.809 --> 07:59.013
It only leads to
torture and war.

07:59.046 --> 08:02.583
Embrace what thou wills,

08:02.616 --> 08:06.020
and discover yourself and more.

08:09.123 --> 08:11.826
So, break the bones and dance.

08:11.859 --> 08:15.529
Just follow your
heart's desires.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.833
Let your passions
blow wild and free,

08:20.034 --> 08:22.203
and set the world on fire!

10:34.869 --> 10:36.437
This is my moment.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.052
Looking good!

10:54.688 --> 10:55.489
Fire!

11:09.303 --> 11:10.404
What the hell are
you doing in here?

11:38.699 --> 11:41.068
This is the coroner report

11:41.101 --> 11:43.505
of county coroner Michael Smith.

11:45.940 --> 11:49.544
Patient is a white male,
approximately 46 years old.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.379
No apparent signs
of strangulation.

11:53.515 --> 11:55.950
Toxicity report
came back negative.

11:57.718 --> 12:02.591
Organ analysis shows no sign
of other interior disease,

12:02.624 --> 12:06.661
and there did not appear to be
any outward sign of struggle.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.065
According to
the police report,

12:11.098 --> 12:14.902
the patient was found on
the living room floor,

12:14.935 --> 12:17.004
and there were no
signs of forced entry.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.774
In my professional opinion,

12:20.808 --> 12:23.210
this patient died
of natural causes.

12:28.816 --> 12:31.252
And that's all anyone's
ever gonna know.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.343
Jenny, I need to talk to you!

13:29.376 --> 13:30.911
Leave me the fuck alone.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.346
- No, it's important!
- Leave me alone, weirdo.

14:01.676 --> 14:03.444
Reports
of pets in the area

14:03.477 --> 14:04.845
going missing in the night.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.815
Locals authorities
suggest, if you have a pet-

14:14.756 --> 14:16.457
Good night, dad.

14:16.490 --> 14:19.460
Good night, pudding.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.562
Gotcha!

15:00.467 --> 15:01.969
Ah, perfect.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.488
There, there, child.

15:54.522 --> 15:56.156
Hi, we're back.

15:56.190 --> 15:58.425
We had such a lovely
time at the park.

15:58.459 --> 15:59.727
It's a pity you missed it.

15:59.761 --> 16:00.695
Who's we?

16:01.729 --> 16:03.163
Huh?

16:03.197 --> 16:04.097
Huh?

16:04.131 --> 16:07.134
What the?

16:12.774 --> 16:13.407
Oh my God.

16:53.581 --> 16:54.716
Sit down!

16:54.749 --> 16:55.650
Sit down, sit down!

16:57.417 --> 16:59.854
Shut up, shut
up, hand it over!

16:59.888 --> 17:00.922
What?

17:00.955 --> 17:02.155
What do you think?

17:02.189 --> 17:03.958
Let go and hand it over, now!

17:03.992 --> 17:06.761
What makes you think
I won't use this?

17:06.794 --> 17:09.329
It's not that easy to kill
someone with that thing.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.131
Certainly not the first one.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.201
You can have your
finger on that trigger,

17:14.233 --> 17:17.337
and your finger is
squeezing real hard like,

17:17.371 --> 17:19.339
but then, your finger
and your brain,

17:19.373 --> 17:21.608
that all-important
connection, then-

17:23.944 --> 17:26.445
Oh my God, oh my God!

17:29.349 --> 17:33.153
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh no!

19:16.223 --> 19:19.894
Do you confess to the
murder of Amber Smith?

19:55.262 --> 19:56.097
Yes.

19:57.765 --> 20:00.068
Did you know the
victim personally?

20:01.903 --> 20:02.704
No.

20:03.705 --> 20:04.939
Then why did you do it?

20:07.608 --> 20:09.010
It's the blood.

20:09.944 --> 20:11.579
It's all about the blood, man.

20:33.835 --> 20:35.770
Do you want to
know if they're mine?

20:35.803 --> 20:37.739
I'll tell you what you
really want to know.

20:38.606 --> 20:39.439
You want to know

20:40.808 --> 20:45.613
how long it took for me to
drain the blood from their body.

20:46.647 --> 20:47.915
You want to know.

20:51.619 --> 20:56.591
All the juicy, gory details,

20:57.825 --> 21:00.828
like how I ripped
out their hearts.

21:04.031 --> 21:06.100
Don't tell me what I did.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.436
I'll tell you what I did.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.972
That's how this goes.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.976
I'm the only one that knows.

21:15.009 --> 21:15.877
Me!

21:17.111 --> 21:19.013
No one else!

21:19.046 --> 21:19.947
No one else.

21:19.981 --> 21:21.215
Do you want to know their names?

21:21.249 --> 21:23.316
Well, then fetch me my hat.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.553
This isn't a discussion!

21:25.586 --> 21:26.419
Get me

21:28.122 --> 21:28.956
my hat!

21:30.124 --> 21:31.358
Hat.

23:38.586 --> 23:39.921
Fucking bitch.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.678
I hope you don't
have any kids.

25:21.422 --> 25:22.423
My savior!

25:23.824 --> 25:24.825
Oh, honey.

25:53.421 --> 25:54.422
Hey.

25:54.455 --> 25:55.289
Hey, have you
seen Dan anywhere?

25:55.322 --> 25:56.090
No, I haven't.

25:56.123 --> 25:57.958
Oh, he's always late.

25:57.992 --> 25:59.326
Do you know where my purse is?

25:59.360 --> 26:02.063
Uh, yeah, inside
the bedroom, I think.

26:08.769 --> 26:09.570
Emily.

26:16.377 --> 26:17.745
Open the door!

26:17.778 --> 26:18.779
Open the door!

26:18.813 --> 26:19.613
There's someone in here!

26:19.647 --> 26:21.215
Open the door, please!

26:21.248 --> 26:23.084
Open the door!

26:23.117 --> 26:25.119
Open it, please,
there's someone in here!

26:25.152 --> 26:26.187
Open the door!

26:26.220 --> 26:27.421
Hey, what's going on?

26:27.455 --> 26:28.355
I just heard screaming.

26:28.389 --> 26:29.924
It's just a Halloween prank.

26:29.957 --> 26:30.758
Oh.

26:30.791 --> 26:31.826
Yeah, Dan's inside,

26:31.859 --> 26:32.827
scaring her with some
stupid mask or something.

26:32.860 --> 26:34.495
Oh.

26:34.529 --> 26:35.362
What?

26:36.397 --> 26:38.099
- Dan?
- Hey.

26:38.132 --> 26:39.767
Sorry I'm late.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.634
Where's Emily?

26:41.503 --> 26:42.336
Shit.

28:50.497 --> 28:55.503
Get off my lawn, you
man bun wearing assholes!

28:56.671 --> 28:59.440
Man buns, be a real
man and grow a beard!

29:00.841 --> 29:04.478
You're a fucking scumbag,
so I need the money now.

29:04.512 --> 29:07.881
All right, I got it.

29:13.287 --> 29:14.922
Yeah, it won't be a problem.

29:14.955 --> 29:16.257
Oh, I'm dead.

29:16.290 --> 29:18.492
Do you agree? He does agree.

29:18.526 --> 29:19.994
What the fuck was that?

29:20.027 --> 29:21.095
If you're buying street drugs,

29:21.128 --> 29:22.329
watch out for the mushrooms

29:22.363 --> 29:23.665
that have the little
red dots on them.

29:23.698 --> 29:25.799
I know I'm tripping balls.

29:37.845 --> 29:39.847
Die, die, die!

29:41.081 --> 29:42.216
You want some more?

29:42.249 --> 29:43.817
Die, die, die, die!

29:45.654 --> 29:47.087
You want some more?

36:19.147 --> 36:22.482
A truly great
thing he has done.

37:54.876 --> 37:57.310
Hello, Karl. Remember me?

37:57.344 --> 37:58.646
Picture the face.

38:01.414 --> 38:02.884
Yeah, you remember.

38:05.485 --> 38:08.089
It's not a very good thing
when you laugh in my face.

38:08.122 --> 38:09.590
Fuck off, whatever.

38:09.624 --> 38:14.061
It brings me to this
horrible boiling point,

38:14.095 --> 38:15.495
and I just erupt.

38:16.697 --> 38:19.700
It makes me very, very angry.

38:19.734 --> 38:20.902
Really?

38:20.935 --> 38:22.136
I know where this
fuck-up of a man

38:22.170 --> 38:25.706
that I'm starting at,
right before me, lives,

38:25.740 --> 38:27.074
and I will come for you, Karl.

38:27.108 --> 38:28.276
You ain't coming here.

38:28.308 --> 38:31.311
You will really,
really regret the day

38:31.344 --> 38:34.148
that you ever laughed
in my fucking face.

38:41.222 --> 38:43.423
Where the fuck are you?

38:43.456 --> 38:45.226
This ain't real.

38:45.259 --> 38:46.060
This ain't real.

38:49.997 --> 38:51.431
It's happening.

41:15.843 --> 41:16.877
No, no, no!

41:18.012 --> 41:19.479
Come on, no, no!

41:20.715 --> 41:22.717
No, no, leave me alone!

41:22.750 --> 41:24.385
What do you want? No!

42:19.473 --> 42:21.042
Oh, baby!

44:42.683 --> 44:45.853
Hey, baby, do you
want to get kinky?

44:47.154 --> 44:48.590
Fuck yeah!

44:48.623 --> 44:51.626
The safe word is "muffin lived".

45:22.856 --> 45:24.124
Muffin, oh...

45:28.162 --> 45:31.732
Okay, strike that
from the record.

45:31.765 --> 45:32.866
You like that?

45:32.900 --> 45:34.868
All right, yeah.

46:01.529 --> 46:03.864
What are you doing, honey?

46:05.299 --> 46:10.304
Oh, shit, muffin, muffin lived,
muffin lived, muffin lived!

46:11.038 --> 46:12.473
Okay.

46:17.978 --> 46:20.914
I don't want to
get kinky anymore.

47:33.020 --> 47:36.256
Don't touch the coin.

47:53.474 --> 47:56.043
Put it back.

48:13.060 --> 48:15.362
Stay out. Stay out.

48:15.396 --> 48:17.565
Stay out!

48:18.767 --> 48:19.601
Stay out!

48:21.335 --> 48:23.170
Get out.

48:23.203 --> 48:24.739
Get out. Stay out.

48:24.773 --> 48:26.173
Leave the woods.

48:26.206 --> 48:28.308
Don't touch the coin, run!

48:28.342 --> 48:29.176
Get out!

48:30.344 --> 48:31.513
Get out, get out!

48:31.546 --> 48:33.213
Run, don't touch the coin!

48:33.247 --> 48:35.517
Stay out, stay out!

48:35.550 --> 48:36.350
Run.

48:43.157 --> 48:44.592
Help me.

48:45.693 --> 48:50.698
Help me.

53:55.368 --> 53:56.838
She's beautiful,

53:56.871 --> 54:01.175
And she was beautiful
when she died 300 years ago.

54:02.677 --> 54:05.312
Well, hold the stake
above her heart,

54:05.345 --> 54:07.414
and I will end her unholy-

54:07.447 --> 54:09.751
- Whoa, whoa, when do I
get to use the mallet?

54:09.784 --> 54:10.918
What?

54:10.952 --> 54:12.186
Well, it's just, you know,

54:12.220 --> 54:13.721
I'm always stuck
holding the stake,

54:13.755 --> 54:16.758
and let's be honest, your aim
isn't as good as it used to.

54:16.791 --> 54:18.526
One mistake, once!

54:18.559 --> 54:19.493
How am I ever going to learn

54:19.527 --> 54:21.229
if you won't give me a chance?

54:21.261 --> 54:25.365
Oh, so now you're the
master vampire hunter.

54:25.398 --> 54:26.634
Is that it?

54:26.667 --> 54:29.137
Old Man Herdenburg can't
cut the mustard anymore.

54:29.170 --> 54:30.270
Is that what people are saying?

54:30.303 --> 54:32.372
Sir, I meant no disrespect.

54:33.608 --> 54:37.245
No, it is I who
should apologize.

54:37.277 --> 54:39.947
You serve me faithfully
and well these many years.

54:39.981 --> 54:41.281
You've earned it.

54:41.314 --> 54:43.551
To you goes the
honor of the kill.

54:47.387 --> 54:50.024
Oh, where did she go?

55:27.295 --> 55:29.063
Oh, where did she go?

55:35.269 --> 55:36.304
Jeez.

55:36.336 --> 55:37.271
Cut.

55:37.305 --> 55:38.338
Ah!
