WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.376
- Previously, on Shooter...

00:09.510 --> 00:11.379
- Never should've burned
that heroin.

00:11.412 --> 00:12.513
- You wanted to talk?

00:12.546 --> 00:13.614
- I know you're working

00:13.647 --> 00:15.183
on a story about a heroin ring

00:15.216 --> 00:16.284
in Afghanistan.
But it would help

00:16.317 --> 00:18.119
if I knew who your source was.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.054
You're Kurt Zehnder,
former member of the 8113.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.522
- 8113 is for life.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.124
- Nice grouping, sweetheart.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.625
You mind if I see
how she handles?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.227
- Yeah, actually.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.795
- Don't have to be
a bitch about it.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.297
- Hey.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.332
- Thanks for the backup.
- Of course.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.134
Any chance you could recommend

00:33.167 --> 00:34.568
a good church
to go to around here?

00:34.602 --> 00:36.437
- We go to St. Francis.
It's just right up the road.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.139
- What's gotten into you?

00:38.172 --> 00:39.407
- You know, I was
having a hard time

00:39.440 --> 00:41.175
after Frankfurt, and...

00:41.209 --> 00:42.476
you know, you being gone
doesn't really

00:42.510 --> 00:44.445
make it any easier, but...

00:44.478 --> 00:45.813
today was a good day.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.548
- People think that
the Deep State

00:47.581 --> 00:49.450
is running things?
Please.

00:49.483 --> 00:52.120
It's Atlas.
They're so black ops,

00:52.153 --> 00:53.354
they're--they're "no ops."

00:53.387 --> 00:55.423
[gunfire]

00:55.456 --> 00:57.325
- They're Los Fantasmas.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.860
- Why send these guys?
- Zehnder said the cartels

00:59.893 --> 01:01.295
were in bed
with a shadowy organization

01:01.329 --> 01:02.463
called Atlas.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.098
Said they even shared a banker.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.433
Some fancy Wharton guy
down in Mexico.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.468
- Zehnder better
never stop running.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.669
- Swagger, it's me.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.371
[gunshot]

01:10.404 --> 01:12.173
- Too bad.
You were the best of them.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.471

01:43.504 --> 01:44.905
- Every shit situation
I've ever been in,

01:44.938 --> 01:46.440
the only thing
that kept me going

01:46.474 --> 01:47.475
was what I had
to be grateful for.

What can I do for you, Sheriff?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.306
Yeah, give me 30 minutes.

[background chatter]

[suspenseful music]

02:30.784 --> 02:32.386
- Have a seat.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.554
- Yes, ma'am.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.659
- So, every time
somebody gets shot around here,

02:38.692 --> 02:40.228
you knock on his door?

02:40.261 --> 02:41.595
- Relax, Sheriff.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.432
And sit down.
You might learn a thing or two.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.767
- Earl Swagger was my partner.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.602
I watched Bob Lee grow up.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.405
I saw him go off to war
to serve his country--

02:51.439 --> 02:52.940
saw the shit his country
put him through

02:52.973 --> 02:55.309
when he came back.

02:55.343 --> 02:58.712
And you flash a badge.

02:58.746 --> 03:02.316
- Thanks for coming in.
We just have a few questions.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.419
We got four dead cartel guys
at the refinery.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.555
Two of them,
clean shot to the head.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.357
Looks like they were shot
at a distance.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.691
You know anything about that?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.760
- I know most cartel guys

03:12.793 --> 03:16.397
usually end up on
the wrong side of a gun.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.633
You know what?
Maybe I could help.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.636
On-site analysis--
might give you a lead.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.607
Were these guys
Los Fantasmas?

03:29.410 --> 03:32.446
- So what are you thinking...
a rival cartel?

03:32.480 --> 03:35.215
Turf war?
- How 'bout I ask the questions.

03:37.618 --> 03:41.455
Where were you yesterday,
Swagger?

03:41.489 --> 03:45.326
Do you own a long gun?

03:45.359 --> 03:47.561
- [sighs, chuckles]

03:47.595 --> 03:49.263
This was fun.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.404
- [sighs]

03:56.437 --> 03:59.340
[tense music]

03:59.373 --> 04:00.808
- If they know
who the bad guys are,

04:00.841 --> 04:03.277
why not take them out?
- You dig up your lawn

04:03.311 --> 04:05.045
to get rid of all the crabgrass,
pretty soon,

04:05.078 --> 04:07.014
you got nothing but dirt.
- Yeah, but better to win

04:07.047 --> 04:08.749
a few battles than
hand them the war.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.718
- Hey, look.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.488
Whoever took those guys down--
now, it don't matter to me.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.490
But it might matter
to Los Fantasmas, though.

[footsteps]

04:19.627 --> 04:21.295
- What do you know about them?

04:21.329 --> 04:24.632
- Usual bullshit--
drugs, guns, and girls.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.367
But no matter what we do,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.569
those trucks are still
gonna come rolling across

04:28.602 --> 04:31.038
the border with the drugs,
and this afternoon,

04:31.071 --> 04:32.640
those same trucks
are going back

04:32.673 --> 04:34.642
loaded full of money.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.844

[car door opens, closes]

05:22.423 --> 05:23.591

05:26.594 --> 05:28.662
So the dead guys
at the refinery

05:28.696 --> 05:30.931
are Fantasmas.
- So?

05:30.964 --> 05:33.867
- So, remember Nadine said
they're connected

05:33.901 --> 05:36.504
to Solotov and Atlas.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.572
- So now you wanna
take on a cartel?

05:38.606 --> 05:40.908
- Naw, just...
poke 'em a little.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.110
- How does that get us Solotov?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.446
- They share the same banker.
We find him,

05:45.479 --> 05:48.949
we cut off the blood
and kill the tumor.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.851
- [sighs]

05:50.884 --> 05:53.787

Hey, Mousey.
Whatcha making?

It's a girl bunny.

- [laughs]

06:24.585 --> 06:27.455
Where are you going?

06:27.488 --> 06:28.922

if you can promise

06:28.956 --> 06:31.892
you'll keep it a secret.
- I will.

- Yeah.

- Hey.
What the hell's so important

07:07.795 --> 07:09.797

- Zehnder faked his death.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.565
- What?
He's still alive?

07:11.599 --> 07:14.835
- He was.
He's dead for real now.

The evidence--everything
Zehnder had, it's gone.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.807
But...I think
there's a bigger story

07:19.840 --> 07:22.610
than just heroin smuggling.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.979
Zehnder was ranting about
some shadowy global conspiracy.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.915

07:27.948 --> 07:32.620
If they exist,
I can't find anything on 'em.

The heroin story, it--
it's dead.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.068
Hmm?

30:02.101 --> 30:03.402
How many you got in those hills?

30:06.538 --> 30:09.141
However many it is,
it is not enough.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.377
He will kill you all.

30:11.410 --> 30:14.080
- And you too.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.447
You gave him up.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.320
Solotov's probably on his way.
I'll get on overwatch.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.389
Try anything funny,
he kills you.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.037

I know this shit sucks

31:02.028 --> 31:04.163
for you, bro.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.332
But me?

I miss it.

- [chuckles]

31:14.340 --> 31:15.541
- Why'd you join the FBI?

31:15.574 --> 31:19.211
- It'll sound cliché,
but, honestly,

31:19.245 --> 31:21.981
I never considered
anything else.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.216
- It's not a cliché.
That's a calling.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.018
- Yeah.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.553
And my dad was part
of the civil rights movement.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.122
He always said
when the FBI showed up

31:30.156 --> 31:33.359
in the South, that's when
he felt the tide turn.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.461
He called them J-Men,
not G-Men.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.495

31:36.528 --> 31:39.065

Time to go.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.076

wait for the Marshals?

32:57.109 --> 32:59.078
- No.
We're on our own now.

33:05.217 --> 33:08.387

It's Federales.

Ali, you got anything?

Ali?

Ali, come in!

Accounts, passwords?

for this shit.

And now Solotov can't
get his money.

the banker alive.

We don't.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.294
This isn't about revenge.
- What about Ali?

37:08.327 --> 37:10.662
- The more people you kill,
the less safe my family is.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.331
- So he can kill
one of our guys,

37:12.364 --> 37:13.965
but we can't kill his?
- It's not strategic.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.634

about your strategy anymore.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.336
They killed Lin.
Everybody dies.

No, I didn't even
tell anybody we met.

Why can't you just
put your head down

37:36.888 --> 37:39.291

- I am not wired that way.

find out the truth.

Shit, there basically
is no truth.

And I don't think you do,
either.

You too.

a two-bedroom listing

38:39.451 --> 38:40.786

doesn't actually mean

38:40.819 --> 38:42.621
that you get to use
the second bedroom.

It depends.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.782
What did you do?

and, uh...

39:14.620 --> 39:15.754
there was this asshole there,

39:15.787 --> 39:18.156
and he...

39:18.189 --> 39:19.625
Sorry.

Shooting range?
