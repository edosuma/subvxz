00:40.734 --> 00:43.533
(serene music playing)

00:58.433 --> 00:59.900
Gin.

00:59.967 --> 01:01.600
Sophia, we're playing hearts.

01:04.367 --> 01:06.266
I felt like drinking some.

01:07.633 --> 01:12.500
To get through a Saturday night
with you two, I'll need a buzz.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.033
Ma, why are you so cranky?

01:15.100 --> 01:17.166
I had plans with Mildred.

01:17.233 --> 01:19.567
She canceled
at the last minute.

01:19.633 --> 01:21.834
The woman had a heart attack.

01:23.533 --> 01:24.700
It wasn't massive.

01:26.367 --> 01:28.834
Girls, does this look okay?

01:28.900 --> 01:31.800
A little overdressed for a quiet
evening at home.

01:31.867 --> 01:34.700
Blanche, Rose has a date.

01:34.767 --> 01:35.767
A date?

01:35.834 --> 01:38.400
Yes. I met him
at the counseling center,

01:38.467 --> 01:39.867
and he asked me to dinner.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.233
Well, Rose has
a date and I don't.

01:44.333 --> 01:47.367
What are the odds of that?

01:47.433 --> 01:49.767
There's probably a better chance
of getting struck by lightning

01:49.834 --> 01:51.967
in a house you won
from Ed McMahon.

01:54.200 --> 01:58.066
Blanche, I'm sure it's a fluke
that nobody called you for a date.

01:58.133 --> 02:01.100
They must have painted the men's
room walls at the pizza hut.

02:03.033 --> 02:05.934
Well, there must be something
wrong with Rose's date.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.100
There has to be.

02:07.166 --> 02:10.667
I bet he's an airhead or a mutant
or an insurance salesman.

02:10.734 --> 02:13.767
That's it, well, Rose,
you and your geek have fun.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.633
And you said she wouldn't take
it well, Dorothy.

02:19.700 --> 02:20.667
Oh.

02:21.834 --> 02:24.633
Sophia, I forgot to give you
this letter.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.500
Oh, from Sicily.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.333
A gift from cousin Vito.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.800
A feather. That's some kind
of message, isn't it?

02:35.867 --> 02:37.233
What are you babbling about?

02:37.300 --> 02:38.633
Don't play dumb with me.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.433
Everything from Sicily
means something.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.600
A black Rose means
a family member is dying.

02:44.667 --> 02:48.333
A white carnation means
a newborn is coming.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.066
A dead rabbit means, "my husband
knows. Get out of town."

02:55.934 --> 02:57.166
Knows what?

02:59.400 --> 03:02.166
The score to <i>South Pacific,</i> Rose.

03:03.233 --> 03:07.367
Maybe Vito just wants
a handmade pillow for Christmas.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.567
-It means nothing. Who cares?
-(doorbell rings)

03:09.633 --> 03:10.567
Aah!

03:10.633 --> 03:15.233
Oh, sorry. I was just excited
about this lovely gift.

03:18.967 --> 03:20.867
-Hi, Ernie.
-Hi, Rose.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.633
Ernie, meet my friends.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.266
This is Dorothy and Blanche
and Sophia.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.000
Everyone, this is Ernie Faber.

03:28.066 --> 03:30.500
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got stuck in court.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.166
What are you charged with?

03:33.900 --> 03:35.633
Nothing. I'm
a corporate attorney.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.900
Damn.

03:39.633 --> 03:42.066
Ernie, have you ever been married?

03:42.133 --> 03:43.266
I'm divorced.

03:43.333 --> 03:47.367
Aw. Was the breakup caused
by your drinking problem?

03:47.433 --> 03:48.934
I don't have one.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.066
Were you cheating on your wife?

03:51.133 --> 03:53.100
What is this,
a Barbara Walters special?

03:55.233 --> 03:57.066
I guess the two of you
want to get going.

03:57.133 --> 03:58.700
It was a pleasure
meeting you all.

03:58.767 --> 04:01.300
Have fun, bye-bye.

04:01.367 --> 04:02.934
Well, he's perfect.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.367
He's absolutely perfect.

04:04.433 --> 04:08.066
I cannot believe he would be
interested in Rose.

04:08.133 --> 04:10.367
He's not perfect after all.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.367
That's right, Dorothy.

04:14.433 --> 04:17.934
Thank you. I feel so much better.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.100
We're living with Robin Givens.

04:24.533 --> 04:27.400
(calm music playing)

04:30.033 --> 04:31.400
Morning, Ma.

04:38.633 --> 04:41.300
Okay. Good morning.

04:41.367 --> 04:42.533
Ma, what is going on?

04:42.600 --> 04:45.834
Since you got that feather,
you're acting like a spy.

04:45.900 --> 04:49.467
I'm surprised you didn't
check the broom closet.

04:49.533 --> 04:52.600
-Broom closet. Right.
-This is ridiculous, Ma.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.867
No, Dorothy, she's right.

04:53.934 --> 04:57.200
I know two people
can fit into the closet

04:57.266 --> 05:00.433
with room left over for
a medium-sized cold cut platter.

05:03.467 --> 05:05.233
What's going on, Ma?

05:05.300 --> 05:08.300
I hoped I could
spare you this, Dorothy,

05:08.367 --> 05:10.633
but it's best you know.

05:10.700 --> 05:14.633
It's about Sonny Venuchio,
as in the Venuchio vendetta.

05:14.700 --> 05:15.867
I never heard of that.

05:15.934 --> 05:18.700
This is a speech, not a quiz.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.300
It all began when your
great-grandfather Nicodemo

05:23.367 --> 05:26.333
was run down by Marco Venuchio's
milk wagon.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.333
He ran him down in cold blood?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.600
Very cold.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.734
Grandpa was already dead.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.100
Unfortunately, there was
a gravediggers' strike,

05:36.166 --> 05:39.533
so the family was using him
as a temporary scarecrow.

05:43.066 --> 05:47.500
The high winds tipped him over,
and Marco used him as a speed bump.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.166
But if it wasn't Marco's fault--

05:52.233 --> 05:56.133
It's a vendetta,
not <i>The People's Court.</i>

05:56.200 --> 06:00.100
Anyway, there's only
one Venuchio alive today, Sonny.

06:00.166 --> 06:03.734
That feather from Vito meant
he's somewhere here in Miami.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.300
Now it's up to me
to take care of him.

06:11.867 --> 06:16.800
Do you expect us to believe you're
going to go through with this?

06:16.867 --> 06:17.767
Believe what you want.

06:17.834 --> 06:22.867
You know what might happen to me
if I didn't do my duty?

06:22.934 --> 06:23.967
What?

06:24.033 --> 06:26.533
Free swimming lessons
with a cement kick-board.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.400
Hi, girls.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.567
Rose, honey,
is something wrong?

06:34.633 --> 06:37.166
No. I'm just a little depressed.

06:37.233 --> 06:38.233
Come on, now, Rose.

06:38.300 --> 06:41.533
If there's something wrong,
you can tell us.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.633
Is it about Ernie?

06:42.700 --> 06:45.500
He's lousy in bed.
I knew it.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.233
I knew there was something wrong
with him.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.533
No, he's not lousy.
I don't think he is.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.367
He is or isn't.

06:55.433 --> 06:56.967
I'm sure he's not.

06:57.033 --> 07:00.800
I have no proof,
but he's not, I think.

07:00.867 --> 07:03.266
-I don't get it.
-Neither does Rose.

07:07.900 --> 07:10.700
You've been seeing him
for over a month,

07:10.767 --> 07:12.200
and you haven't done it?

07:12.266 --> 07:14.800
He hasn't made one move.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.033
There was the time at dinner.

07:17.100 --> 07:20.266
I thought he was coming on
strong suddenly,

07:20.333 --> 07:24.033
but he was looking for his napkin
under the table.

07:27.467 --> 07:29.633
What have you been doing?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.567
How long can you
make conversation?

07:31.633 --> 07:34.033
Blanche, there is
more to conversation

07:34.100 --> 07:38.133
than just "can I have a hanger
for my pants, please?"

07:39.133 --> 07:42.867
Oh, Ernie's not like that.
He's very special.

07:42.934 --> 07:46.900
He doesn't want to hop into bed
after just one date.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.000
-This is an attribute?
-Yes.

07:50.066 --> 07:52.166
I love it.

07:52.233 --> 07:55.233
In fact, I think I love him.

07:55.300 --> 07:59.333
Oh, honey.
Rose, that's wonderful.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.333
But I still can't understand

08:01.400 --> 08:07.333
why he hasn't even approached
the subject of... you know... sex.

08:09.066 --> 08:13.333
Not that I'm in a hurry or anything,
but we've been dating a while.

08:13.400 --> 08:17.800
Sometimes you have to stoke
a man's fire a little bit.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.800
Words of wisdom
from the human torch.

08:24.934 --> 08:26.100
Listen...

08:28.400 --> 08:31.000
if he really means
that much to you,

08:31.066 --> 08:35.333
and he feels the same way,
things will happen naturally.

08:35.400 --> 08:40.333
If you don't want to wait, there are
other avenues you can take.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.867
There are dozens of ways
to seduce a man.

08:42.934 --> 08:45.934
Hundreds. Maybe even thousands.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.567
You should forget the ones

08:47.633 --> 08:50.667
that involve swinging naked
from a door frame.

08:52.967 --> 08:56.000
You need to get him
in a romantic situation.

08:56.066 --> 08:58.967
Ask him to take you
away one weekend.

08:59.033 --> 09:02.033
I think we should try
holding hands first.

09:02.533 --> 09:06.166
Blanche has a point...
finally.

09:06.233 --> 09:08.433
If he doesn't want
to go away with you,

09:08.500 --> 09:09.967
you'll know how he feels.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.000
(doorbell rings)

09:11.066 --> 09:12.834
That's probably Ernie.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.233
I can't ask him
to go away with me.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.200
I've never been aggressive.

09:20.266 --> 09:23.433
Honey, it's as easy
as riding a bicycle.

09:24.767 --> 09:26.700
I never learned
how to ride a bicycle.

09:28.867 --> 09:31.533
It's as easy as falling off
a bicycle.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.233
Really?
Well, that is easy.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.567
Thanks, Dorothy.

09:37.567 --> 09:39.734
It was just a hunch.

09:42.934 --> 09:46.667
-Hi, Ernie.
-Rose, I'm on my way to the office.

09:46.734 --> 09:48.567
There's been an emergency.

09:48.633 --> 09:50.166
Could we postpone our date?

09:50.667 --> 09:52.100
I was going to ask you--

09:52.166 --> 09:56.000
I'd like to make this up to you.

09:56.066 --> 09:57.667
How about going
away this weekend?

09:58.166 --> 10:02.767
I know it's sudden, but I'd really
like to take you somewhere special.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.000
What do you say?

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
Well...

10:06.033 --> 10:08.300
yes. That sounds wonderful.

10:10.266 --> 10:11.500
That's great.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.166
I'll call you later, Rose.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.834
Well, looks like everything
worked out after all.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.133
Were you listening
to our conversation?

10:24.200 --> 10:25.567
Absolutely not.

10:25.633 --> 10:27.734
You know we'd never eavesdrop.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.200
They made me do it.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.333
When I turn my hearing aid up to 10,

10:33.400 --> 10:36.200
I can hear a canary break wind
in Lauderdale.

10:46.266 --> 10:49.233
Oh, Rose.
I'm having a wonderful time.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.533
-You're a lot of fun to be with.
-Oh, I'm having a good time too.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.133
I don't think I've had this much fun

10:54.200 --> 10:57.500
since I was a little girl
back in St. Olaf.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.900
I remember once
when I was about ten...

11:04.667 --> 11:06.700
You were about to tell a story.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.767
Why did you stop?

11:07.834 --> 11:11.900
Well, this is usually when Dorothy
and Blanche interrupt me.

11:14.300 --> 11:17.300
Anyway, I always go to the movies

11:17.367 --> 11:19.500
every Saturday afternoon
with all my friends.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.066
Oh, we'd have a ball.

11:21.133 --> 11:24.000
Of course, the only problem was
our town theater was designed

11:24.066 --> 11:25.967
for silent movies.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.700
They never put
in a sound system?

11:27.767 --> 11:28.767
No.

11:28.834 --> 11:33.266
Luckily, our school teacher, Ms. Sigerson
was an excellent lip reader.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.033
She'd do all the dialogue.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.400
Although there were
some problems

11:37.467 --> 11:39.800
sometimes,
through most of <i>Citizen Kane</i>

11:39.867 --> 11:42.266
we all thought everybody was
looking for a rowboat.

11:42.333 --> 11:45.233
(laughs)

11:48.367 --> 11:49.367
Rose.

11:51.066 --> 11:54.000
There's something I should
have told you from the start.

11:54.066 --> 11:55.900
What, Ernie?
What's wrong?

11:55.967 --> 11:57.333
I was hoping this weekend,

11:57.400 --> 12:01.300
this romantic setting might help,
but it hasn't.

12:02.333 --> 12:06.667
I was hoping that it might help me
get over my... problem.

12:06.734 --> 12:08.367
What problem?

12:08.433 --> 12:12.100
It's not easy for a man to say,
Rose.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.200
I'm impotent.

12:15.934 --> 12:17.367
I see.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.934
Well, in that case,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.300
why don't we see
what's playing at the movies?

12:30.834 --> 12:34.867
(mellow music playing)

12:35.333 --> 12:38.700
Yeah.
Is this the Venuchio residence?

12:38.767 --> 12:40.400
It is?

12:40.467 --> 12:42.900
Is Sonny Venuchio there?

12:42.967 --> 12:45.266
He is?
Sorry, wrong number.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.100
Does this have to do with that
vendetta business?

12:50.166 --> 12:51.467
Don't even discuss it.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.967
The whole thing is ridiculous.

12:54.033 --> 12:57.367
Dorothy, this vendetta
is a very real thing.

12:57.433 --> 12:59.834
It goes to my soul as a Sicilian.

12:59.900 --> 13:02.100
You don't have to acknowledge it.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.600
Fine, Ma.

13:03.667 --> 13:06.400
I may need a ride later
to confession.

13:06.467 --> 13:09.367
They go easier on you
if it's just an impure thought.

13:14.300 --> 13:17.367
Well, well. You got in pretty
late last night.

13:17.433 --> 13:18.100
I know.

13:18.166 --> 13:21.533
So tell us all about
the big weekend.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.133
Don't leave out a thing.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.533
Start with the sweet nothings
he whispered in your ear.

13:26.600 --> 13:31.533
Well, okay, first, he said
I was a very attractive woman.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.600
-Yeah?
-Yeah?

13:33.667 --> 13:36.133
He said I was fun to be with.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.734
-Yeah?
-Yeah?

13:38.800 --> 13:40.433
Then he said he was impotent.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.934
-Eew!
-Eew!

13:44.000 --> 13:46.367
Ooh... impotent.

13:46.433 --> 13:47.333
Are you sure?

13:47.400 --> 13:50.300
What would you have done,
asked him to prove it?

13:54.700 --> 13:56.633
I can't talk about this.

13:56.700 --> 13:59.800
Of course, you can, Rose,
we're your friends.

13:59.867 --> 14:01.567
We're here to listen.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.100
I mean, we've all spoken
at one time or another

14:04.166 --> 14:06.133
about a sexual problem.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.433
Not me.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.767
It's not your fault
and it's not Ernie's.

14:11.834 --> 14:15.834
I mean, we've all been
with a man who couldn't perform.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.433
Not me.

14:18.867 --> 14:21.533
I just feel so undesirable.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.700
Honey, we all have at some point.
I know Blanche, not you.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.133
I remember when Stanley
and I were going through this.

14:32.200 --> 14:36.700
We tried everything,
relaxation techniques, hypnosis.

14:36.767 --> 14:38.600
I fed the man so many oysters

14:38.667 --> 14:42.166
when he passed a kidney stone,
I had it appraised.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.367
I mean, this went on for two years
before he found a cure.

14:47.433 --> 14:48.133
What was it?

14:48.200 --> 14:50.266
A blonde stewardess with a butt

14:50.333 --> 14:54.300
that would have made Gandhi
throw in the towel.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.000
Rose, will you stop seeing Ernie?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.667
No, of course not.

15:01.734 --> 15:05.233
How about you and Ernie
seeing a sex therapist?

15:05.734 --> 15:07.467
I could talk to Ernie.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.266
We could make an appointment.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.700
Sex therapy is one solution,
but there are other ways.

15:12.767 --> 15:16.533
Blanche, dessert toppings
are not the answer.

15:20.533 --> 15:23.367
I was talking about patience.

15:23.433 --> 15:27.934
Just tell Ernie sex is not the most
important part of a relationship.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.266
Just ask anybody married to
an Englishman.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.800
I'm going to call Ernie right now.

15:36.867 --> 15:39.033
We have a lot to talk about.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.233
Ok, Dorothy, I'm going for a walk.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.667
If I don't return,
take care of Sonny Venuchio.

15:47.734 --> 15:48.967
His address is on the table.

15:49.033 --> 15:50.000
That's it.

15:50.066 --> 15:54.967
Look at me and tell me this
vendetta business is all a joke.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.633
This vendetta business
is all a joke.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.533
(telephone rings)

15:59.600 --> 16:03.867
Now look me in the eye
and tell me you're not lying.

16:03.934 --> 16:05.400
I'm not lying.

16:05.467 --> 16:06.700
Sophia, it's for you.

16:06.767 --> 16:09.100
He says his name is Tony the Hook.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.767
Tell him I'll call him back.

16:14.767 --> 16:16.033
What are you looking at?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.433
He's my butcher.

16:19.266 --> 16:21.133
Yeah, that's it. My butcher.

16:28.100 --> 16:31.633
(serene music playing)

16:34.200 --> 16:36.533
-How's your souffle, Rose?
-Delicious.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.166
I never got the hang
of making these.

16:39.233 --> 16:41.233
There's nothing more frustrating

16:41.300 --> 16:44.333
than waiting for these suckers
to rise, and they just won't.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.834
That's no reflection on you, Ernie.

16:58.333 --> 17:01.600
I know why you called me
and wanted to have dinner.

17:01.667 --> 17:02.700
You do?

17:02.767 --> 17:04.800
You want to stop seeing me.

17:04.867 --> 17:06.333
Ernie, that's not true.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.633
Come on, Rose.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.967
You can't be happy
with the way things are.

17:11.033 --> 17:14.700
You're a healthy, active,
sexy woman.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.133
I'm also a patient woman, Ernie.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.834
I mean, really, I'm probably
the most patient person you know.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.467
Try to think of somebody else.
I'll wait.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.367
You tell me honestly,

17:28.433 --> 17:31.767
you don't think there's something
lacking in this relationship?

17:31.834 --> 17:33.533
No!

17:33.600 --> 17:37.333
I think you're a kind,
generous, caring man.

17:37.400 --> 17:43.033
As far as this physical side goes,
we'll just take things slow,

17:43.100 --> 17:47.133
and if it turns out
that we can't be anything more

17:47.200 --> 17:51.633
than just good friends...
well, that's good enough for me.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.433
I'm lucky to have found
someone like you.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.367
I feel the same way.

17:57.433 --> 18:01.700
If you ask me, people rely too much
on sex in relationships.

18:01.767 --> 18:05.633
You're right.
I mean, what is sex after all?

18:05.700 --> 18:09.567
Two clunky old bodies
thrashing around against each other.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.600
Like animals.

18:13.734 --> 18:16.200
You get all sweaty and flushed.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.834
Your hair gets mussed.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.100
You lose your breath.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.767
You lose your earrings.

18:25.467 --> 18:27.300
Your mouth waters.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.700
Your nose runs.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.800
Your heart races.

18:31.867 --> 18:33.233
Your blood races.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.767
-Rose...
-Say it, Ernie.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.700
It's time, Rose.

18:37.767 --> 18:39.934
Check, please!

18:49.567 --> 18:52.300
(soft music playing)

18:52.800 --> 18:55.233
Blanche, look at this picture.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.500
A man's body was washed ashore
last night.

18:58.567 --> 18:59.967
Oh, how horrible.

19:00.033 --> 19:06.000
Look. It says a tan bamboo purse
was found at the scene.

19:06.066 --> 19:07.233
You know what that means?

19:07.300 --> 19:10.800
The man was murdered on his way
to a Peter Allen concert?

19:11.900 --> 19:15.133
No. It makes me think about ma
and that ridiculous vendetta.

19:15.200 --> 19:18.633
If I didn't know ma,
I might actually consider--

19:18.700 --> 19:20.133
Anybody seen my purse?

19:20.200 --> 19:23.967
Oh, God, Ma!
How could you do this?

19:24.033 --> 19:26.600
Relax, Dorothy.
I probably left it at Sonny's place.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.967
Right next to his body.

19:29.033 --> 19:30.600
How did you know?

19:30.667 --> 19:33.734
It's on the front page
of today's paper.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.500
Oh.

19:35.567 --> 19:37.900
That's not sonny.
That's a dead guy.

19:37.967 --> 19:40.800
Of course,
if you carried out that vendetta.

19:40.867 --> 19:44.867
This was an eighties vendetta.
It was all symbolic.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.800
You find the guy,
drop a fish on his doorstep,

19:47.867 --> 19:51.166
you wash your hands
of the whole thing.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.967
Wait a minute.

19:53.033 --> 19:56.900
If that's all you did, how come
your purse is still over there?

19:56.967 --> 20:00.934
Well,
maybe I did leave one thing out.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.200
While I was giving Sonny the
evil eye, I noticed he was cute.

20:05.266 --> 20:09.033
I decided to work in
a little kiss of death too.

20:10.033 --> 20:14.000
That livened him up, and we
spent a very pleasant afternoon.

20:14.066 --> 20:16.100
(Blanche) Oh...

20:16.166 --> 20:17.700
Ma, you are incredible.

20:17.767 --> 20:19.900
Those were Sonny's words exactly.

20:22.934 --> 20:24.000
Good morning.

20:30.467 --> 20:32.266
Well, good morning.

20:32.333 --> 20:35.734
Rose Nylund, you little devil.
Just look at you.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.934
-Why?
-Don't get coy. I can tell.

20:39.033 --> 20:43.266
The rosy cheeks, bright smile, the
distant, not-quite-there expression.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.367
She looks that way every day.
What's your point?

20:46.867 --> 20:49.567
<i>♪ Rose has been with a man ♪</i>

20:49.633 --> 20:51.834
What if I was with Ernie?

20:51.900 --> 20:53.767
With Ernie?

20:53.834 --> 20:57.166
Oh! Oh! Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, honey, congratulations!

20:57.233 --> 20:58.400
I'm so happy for you.

20:58.467 --> 21:03.066
It was a roll in the hay,
not a walk on the moon.

21:04.867 --> 21:09.800
Ernie's the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

21:09.867 --> 21:12.767
I haven't been this happy
with a man since Charlie.

21:12.834 --> 21:15.533
We're going on a picnic today.

21:17.033 --> 21:19.567
Oh, I don't believe this.

21:19.633 --> 21:22.266
Hey, she didn't even tell us
how it happened.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.767
Same way it happened
the last time you did it.

21:27.166 --> 21:30.333
Of course, hair styles
may have changed since then.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.700
Oh, I had a marvelous time
tonight, Ernie.

21:42.767 --> 21:43.934
So did I, Rose.

21:44.867 --> 21:49.533
Rose... there's something
very important I want to say to you.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.300
Okay.

21:51.467 --> 21:54.567
I want you to know how much
I appreciate all you've done.

21:54.633 --> 21:59.166
After my marriage failed, I couldn't
perform like a man should.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.467
It's because of your warmth
and understanding

22:01.533 --> 22:03.533
that I got through this.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.100
I never thought
I'd find happiness ever again.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.467
Some marriages don't work out,
but some do.

22:12.533 --> 22:14.467
You're right, Rose.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.500
That's why I think
I can patch things up with her.

22:20.867 --> 22:22.166
What?

22:22.233 --> 22:24.767
My wife never remarried
after the divorce, and...

22:26.033 --> 22:28.934
I never stopped loving her, Rose.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.133
I see.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.367
I have to give this a shot.
I really think I can make things work.

22:33.433 --> 22:34.900
I hope you can, Ernie.

22:34.967 --> 22:37.934
It's something I really need to try.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.133
Oh, I understand. Really, I do.

22:43.066 --> 22:45.133
I'll never forget
what you've done for me.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.133
It's all over.

22:59.567 --> 23:01.600
We know.

23:01.667 --> 23:02.400
We heard.

23:02.467 --> 23:04.500
Now, honey,
don't you be depressed.

23:04.567 --> 23:07.000
What you did was wonderful.

23:07.066 --> 23:11.367
It's all because you're such a kind
and sensitive and caring person.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.734
You gave him back his manhood.

23:15.333 --> 23:17.667
If he can find it, he can have it.

23:23.567 --> 23:26.166
He's probably the worst lover
I've ever had.

23:29.967 --> 23:34.000
-I'll get the ice cream.
-I'll get the cheesecake.

23:34.066 --> 23:35.667
I'll get the etch-a-sketch.

23:35.734 --> 23:37.900
At my age, I need a visual aid.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.734
(theme music playing)
