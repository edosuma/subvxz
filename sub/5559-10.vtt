WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.372
Previously
on Minority Report...

00:04.405 --> 00:06.107
Remember me?
My name is Wally.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.175
I'm here to help.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.343
Blomfeld thinks we never
should've ended Precrime.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.512
My agency had plans for them.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.646
You're one of them.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.781
So, what do you want me to do?

00:13.814 --> 00:14.782
Retire.

00:14.815 --> 00:15.783
Stop.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.785
One more and then I'm done.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.787
I'm out for good.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.389
Memento Mori is planning

00:21.422 --> 00:22.556
a terrorist attack
on the district.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.325
Coded message cards delivered

00:24.358 --> 00:26.760
to scientists, each one stamped

00:26.794 --> 00:28.529
with the anamorphic image
of a human skull.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.730
Get down!

00:29.763 --> 00:31.665
Get her to a hospital now!

00:31.699 --> 00:33.601
Get me a secure exit!

00:33.634 --> 00:35.203
If Congress moves forward
with this bill,

00:35.236 --> 00:37.538
the senator's just going
to be the beginning.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.839
Agatha?

00:38.872 --> 00:40.574
They came to the island.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.276
They found you?

00:42.310 --> 00:43.844
I just barely got away.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.413
It's happening.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.686
Put them in.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.589
WOMAN:
Let's see.

00:55.623 --> 00:59.393
High school--
built a DIY neural interface

00:59.427 --> 01:01.329
for a neighbor's paraplegic dog.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.364
Then MIT.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.833
Expelled at 17
after a privacy protest

01:05.866 --> 01:07.868
escalated into illegally

01:07.901 --> 01:11.605
accessing NSA's
Utah Data Center.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.208
(clears throat)

01:14.242 --> 01:16.477
We've had our eye on you,
Mr. Wallace.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.446
Am I under arrest?

01:18.479 --> 01:20.748
We'd like to offer you a job.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.251
(laughs)

01:24.518 --> 01:26.620
Sorry, I-I...

01:26.654 --> 01:29.290
A job for the police?

01:29.323 --> 01:31.559
Sort of a new program.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.528
It's hush-hush.

01:38.666 --> 01:42.170
This is a nondisclosure
agreement.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.205
Working with what?

01:44.238 --> 01:46.174
You first.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.581
It's not "what."

01:55.916 --> 01:58.352
It's who.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.197
Are they okay?

02:09.197 --> 02:10.864
WOMAN: Considering they can
predict every murder

02:10.898 --> 02:12.300
within a hundred miles?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.302
Pretty normal kids.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.504
You want to meet them?

02:18.272 --> 02:20.908
Can they see us?

02:20.941 --> 02:21.642
BOTH:
Boo!

02:21.675 --> 02:22.910
(gasps)

02:22.943 --> 02:24.612
(both laughing)

02:24.645 --> 02:26.747
You guys
are such idiots.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.255
And then the neural interface
collects the photons

02:34.288 --> 02:36.890
emitted by your neurons
on each action potential.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.427
Will there be
a test on this?

02:39.460 --> 02:41.795
No, I didn't want you
to be scared.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.598
I thought understanding
how it works might help.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.799
We're not scared.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.301
We want to help.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.837
Besides, it'll only be
for a few days.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.773
(chuckles)

02:52.806 --> 02:55.309
Dinner after is on me.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.647
(indistinct chatter)

03:03.484 --> 03:05.453
Their last session
in the milk bath was 36 hours,

03:05.486 --> 03:07.388
but we hope to beat that.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.823
Every time we take them out,
we miss another murder.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.260
What, you want to put
them in for longer?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.431
The decision has been made.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.766
How much longer?

03:18.799 --> 03:19.900
If we're lucky?

03:19.933 --> 03:22.270
60 years.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.871
They're just kids.

03:23.904 --> 03:24.972
No one likes it, Mr. Wallace.

03:25.005 --> 03:28.442
But three lives in exchange
for how many thousands?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.412
I'll give you the day
to think about it.

03:38.952 --> 03:42.323
Okay, lie back.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.492
There you go.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.494
Agatha, are you

03:46.527 --> 03:47.795
feeling comfortable?

03:47.828 --> 03:55.736
Yeah, thanks, Wally.

03:55.769 --> 03:56.970
Okay, okay,
I'll ask him.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.506
Hold on, geez.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.573
Hey, Wally?

03:59.607 --> 04:01.975
Can we watch that movie again
after we're done?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.545
Sure, Dash.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.480
Many times
as you want.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.916
That movie sucked.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.518
See you tomorrow, Wally.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.554
Yeah.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.589
See you then.

04:35.909 --> 04:41.349
DASH: There are three of us:
Agatha, Arthur and me, Dash.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.551
We were called
the Precognitives.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.787
We can see murders
before they happen.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.623
For six years,
we were held against our will

04:49.657 --> 04:51.625
and used to save lives.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.795
But after the government's
Precrime program was shut down,

04:54.828 --> 04:56.897
we were finally released.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.801
We kept ourselves safe
and hidden from the world,

05:00.834 --> 05:02.836
until now.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.640
REPORTER: The senator is
in critical condition

05:06.674 --> 05:08.476
after the assassination
attempt.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.611
Police have
the assailant in custody.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.946
His name is Dr. Lionel Gray,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.082
a genetic scientist
at Seoul National University...

05:15.115 --> 05:17.885
This is what we're
dealing with now?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.920
Decentralized cells.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.855
We have a tonnage
issue with insanity

05:21.889 --> 05:22.890
in this country.

05:22.923 --> 05:23.957
And genius insanity,

05:23.991 --> 05:26.126
which is
a dangerous combination.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.929
Attacking with a genetic slime
that modifies cells,

05:28.962 --> 05:32.633
turning facial skin pigments
into a hideous death mask.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.469
You know Memento Mori
is going to try to top this.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.771
Even though Gray is in custody.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.673
I do.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.575
And a conventional defensive
strategy isn't gonna cut it.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.044
Which is why we have
to be creative like them.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.479
But unless you're here
to tell me that you found...

05:45.513 --> 05:46.747
I did.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.716
I am here to tell you
I found them.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.985
I told you about Charles Peele.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.021
Former employee,
broke into D.I.A.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.024
to steal the plans
for your new Precog milk bath.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.127
You figured he was doing it
for one of them.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.763
That lead pan out?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.432
It led us to the cabin
of a woman on Fiddler's Neck.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.033
By the time we arrived,
it was deserted.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.801
She must have seen us coming.

06:07.835 --> 06:11.439
We pulled DNA from the residence
and sequenced it.

06:11.439 --> 06:15.809
This allowed predictive facial
reconstruction of three people.

06:15.843 --> 06:19.012
A female and two males, twins.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.782
Now, none of these matched any
genetic records in the database.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.617
But a fourth sample did.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.919
A D.C. Metro
homicide detective.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.621
Her name is Lara Vega.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.757
Let's just say
her recent arrest record

06:29.790 --> 06:31.625
has been exceptional.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.627
You think she's
working with them?

06:33.661 --> 06:36.129
There's only one way
to find out.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.932
You told me that
you're not alone.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.868
That there are others
working with you.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.571
I said others with a conscience.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.807
Do I get to urinate?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.776
Sure, as soon as you help us.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.143
If this ensemble
wasn't so flattering,

06:50.177 --> 06:51.479
I'd be tempted to sully myself.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.513
Who is working with you,

06:52.546 --> 06:53.747
Dr. Gray?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.816
I'm ruling out
Nobel Prize winners.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.986
As I told you,
Memento Mori

06:59.019 --> 07:00.588
is not centralized.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.756
We share a common
mind but work alone.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.658
Isn't that correct,

07:04.692 --> 07:07.060
"persons behind the curtain"?

07:07.094 --> 07:09.497
Every answer he gives,
he might as well

07:09.497 --> 07:10.698
be meditating.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.533
No bounce
in the biometrics.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.568
Someone cut him and
see if he bleeds.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.104
I'd be happy to.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.507
I figured you'd be more
forthcoming, Dr. Gray.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.709
You didn't exactly fight
when we arrested you.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.945
Suicide-by-cop is not on
my bucket list, Detective.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.647
MAN:
Special Agent Glasser?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.649
They're waiting for you
in interrogation, sir.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.984
This is about to get
more interesting.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.055
Wrap it up, Vega.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.691
The feds are here.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.029
How's it going in there?

07:42.062 --> 07:43.864
The guy is unflappable.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.599
What's the latest
on the senator?

07:45.633 --> 07:47.034
Intensive care.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.602
She isn't gonna make it.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.171
What's with Lurch?

07:55.242 --> 07:56.243
Andromeda.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.645
You know her?

07:57.678 --> 08:00.047
She works for my brother.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.114
Is everything okay?

08:08.055 --> 08:09.657
About an hour ago we received

08:09.690 --> 08:11.592
an anonymized message
on our server.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.628
The Memento Mori symbol--
a distorted human skull.

08:14.662 --> 08:17.130
Accompanied with the warning:
"Stop the vote."

08:17.164 --> 08:18.231
Steven's Law.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.834
The genetic modification bill.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.670
Congress is set
to vote later today.

08:22.703 --> 08:23.671
They're going to be
even more determined

08:23.704 --> 08:25.072
to go through with it now,

08:25.105 --> 08:27.274
given the assault
on Senator Meizhou-Shi.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.943
We think Memento Mori
must be planning to execute

08:29.977 --> 08:32.279
a wider-scale attack in protest
as early as today.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.781
DIETRICH:
The department
is on high alert.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.749
Your department is going to be

08:35.783 --> 08:38.118
following our lead on this
from now on.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.087
I'll start by interviewing
the suspect.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.055
Sir, if I may suggest,
you may want to keep

08:42.089 --> 08:43.223
Detective Vega
in the room with you.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.625
He's right, sir.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.595
He seems to respond to her.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.262
Thank you, Agent Shale,
but we're well-staffed.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.198
We appreciate you
allowing us to share

08:51.231 --> 08:53.734
your facility, Chief Dietrich.
Moving Dr. Gray

08:53.767 --> 08:55.736
to another venue would have
taken up valuable time

08:55.769 --> 08:58.138
if another attack is imminent.
Shall we?

08:58.171 --> 08:59.740
Yes, sir.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.775
He gave up too easy.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.613
Dr. Gray.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.615
He wants to be here.

09:07.615 --> 09:11.084
Well, we're glad
to have him.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.957
Where is Dash?
I don't know.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.959
Because people's lives
are at stake here.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.733
Where is Dash?

09:25.766 --> 09:27.801
Some freakishly tall woman
came to see him.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.002
Andromeda.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.070
If you say so.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.171
She works for Arthur.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.372
Did he say where
they were going?

09:32.405 --> 09:33.641
No, they didn't
say anything at all.

09:33.641 --> 09:34.708
They just left.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.977
Without telling me?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.646
He's not 12, Vega.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.884
Where you going?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.919
Vega?
(door closes)

09:54.194 --> 09:55.796
Agatha?

09:55.829 --> 09:58.065
In the flesh.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.833
Blomfeld found
the cabin.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.401
She barely made it
out in time.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.671
Then she left things behind
that will lead them here.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.038
I'm not sentimental
in that way.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.040
And Arthur's kept
my identities fresh.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.076
VEGA:
Yeah, but you left DNA.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.310
I'm sure Blomfeld
sequenced it already

10:10.343 --> 10:11.779
for predictive
facial recognition.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.081
You all need to leave
the city now.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.851
This may be the only time
you ever hear this, Vega.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.287
But I couldn't agree
with you more.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.354
I need to get
to my apartment.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.056
No, it's too risky.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.793
Blomfeld has the weight
and reach of D.I.A. behind him.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.728
Unless he doesn't.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.130
There were only
three of them at Wally's.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.333
He arrived without a warrant,
ransacked Wally's place,

10:33.366 --> 10:35.402
and never brought him in
for questioning-- why?

10:35.435 --> 10:36.870
He doesn't want
anyone else at D.I.A.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.071
to know he's looking for you.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.207
Yeah, because he's gone rogue.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.709
Or he's working
for someone else.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.311
Foreign government,

10:44.344 --> 10:45.713
defense contractors.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.247
If he's gone rogue,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.683
he'll limit his access
to the D.I.A. databases

10:49.717 --> 10:51.118
so it can't be traced
back to him.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.753
But no accountability.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.088
So no need for him
to play by the rules.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.857
Don't engage Blomfeld.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.793
Get out of the city.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.429
She's right.

11:02.462 --> 11:05.265
This is the future
you've been seeing.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.734
We need to run.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.836
Unless there's no escaping it.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.738
We've been aware
of this for months.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.939
We've been waiting for it.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.440
And everything that's happened,

11:13.473 --> 11:14.742
everything
we've done...

11:14.775 --> 11:17.244
my vision has
stayed the same.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.813
I still see us

11:19.847 --> 11:21.014
in that milk bath.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.115
What are you saying?

11:22.149 --> 11:23.984
Maybe trying to run away
is futile.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.755
You got to be kidding me.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.489
For three months,
I've been hearing you warn us

11:29.522 --> 11:31.124
that they're going to force us
into a milk bath

11:31.158 --> 11:32.325
and now you just
want to give up?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.094
I didn't say that, Arthur.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.296
We need to keep
our emotions in check.

11:36.329 --> 11:39.132
And you wonder why I was the
first one to leave the island.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.233
If you had both stayed,

11:40.267 --> 11:41.234
this wouldn't be

11:41.268 --> 11:42.335
happening right now.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.771
I'd rather die violently here

11:43.771 --> 11:44.938
than in my sleep there.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.139
Well, thank you
for taking me with you.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.174
Guys, not now!

11:47.207 --> 11:49.943
(gasping)

11:49.977 --> 11:51.378
Dash...

11:55.448 --> 11:57.851
Can we get some air in here?

11:57.885 --> 11:59.953
(people screaming)

11:59.987 --> 12:01.388
Ah...

12:03.523 --> 12:05.392
99. Melendez.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.460
Gianelli. Santos.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.429
(screaming)

12:09.462 --> 12:11.198
God, it's so hot.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.067
(gasping):
Air.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.269
Air.

12:17.070 --> 12:21.108
Can... you see?

12:27.314 --> 12:28.916
How many do you remember?

12:28.949 --> 12:30.050
You heard the names.
How many do you remember?

12:30.083 --> 12:33.186
Melendez,
Gianelli, Santos...

12:33.220 --> 12:34.387
I don't know.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.956
Can you try to remember more?

12:35.989 --> 12:37.524
No, it's just one
big... jumble.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.192
I also heard a number.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.828
"99."
You kept repeating it.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.562
Your guess is as good as mine.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.298
AGATHA:
Men and women,
suffering.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.834
Like nothing I've felt before.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.001
What do you mean?

12:48.035 --> 12:49.837
We were so many.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.304
Dying together.

12:51.338 --> 12:52.505
What kind of an attack?

12:52.539 --> 12:53.841
Our eyes,

12:53.874 --> 12:55.108
our faces were...

12:55.142 --> 12:56.209
Same thing that happened
to the senator.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.078
Memento Mori.
Memento...

12:58.111 --> 12:59.880
Terrorists.
We have one in custody

12:59.913 --> 13:01.414
for the attack
on Senator Meizhou-Shi.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.183
Can you tell where
this attack takes place?

13:03.216 --> 13:04.451
Indoors, I think.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.954
I really couldn't see much else.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.555
And what about you, Dash?
You sure the only thing

13:08.588 --> 13:09.957
that you saw...
Yes.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.125
A park and a swing.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.861
No bodies,
no-no sign of violence?

13:13.861 --> 13:14.862
It was a minority report.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.196
When one of us sees

13:16.229 --> 13:17.464
a different future
than the other two.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.132
Bad time to be having
one of those.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.600
Sorry, Detective,
we're only human.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.136
I realize sometimes
that's hard to remember.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.507
I have to get back.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.309
And do what?

13:29.342 --> 13:30.944
And tell them that an attack
on the city is imminent.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.245
Then I'm coming
with you.
No.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.313
There's nothing for you to do.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.314
You didn't even see it.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.116
I'll be back.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.284
Just be ready to move quickly.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.518
AGATHA:
And when they ask you

13:38.551 --> 13:40.153
how you know
this attack is coming,

13:40.187 --> 13:41.554
what will you say?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.323
I'll tell them the truth.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.426
That I just know.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.629
You do know I was doing
fine in this city

13:49.662 --> 13:51.164
before the both of you
showed up?

13:53.500 --> 13:57.104
GLASSER:
Can't stonewall us
forever, Doctor.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.139
There are other ways to get
these answers out of you.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.442
They're gonna
hit us today.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.911
Memento Mori?
Yes.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.112
How do you know? Dash?

14:05.145 --> 14:06.479
And Agatha.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.348
They're together?

14:08.381 --> 14:09.983
Where?
Let's worry
about the attack,

14:10.017 --> 14:11.618
not where they are.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.520
There's going to be heavy
casualties, maybe hundreds.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.088
It's another
viral vector attack,

14:15.122 --> 14:16.289
but this time on a larger scare.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.357
What's the target?

14:17.390 --> 14:18.491
We couldn't tell.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.327
We need to bring them in.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.995
They've done enough.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.296
We're talking about
a terrorist attack,

14:23.330 --> 14:25.098
hundreds of lives...

14:25.132 --> 14:26.934
I think they can spare
a few hours out of their day.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.301
It's not a few hours.
If Blomfeld finds them,

14:28.335 --> 14:29.502
he'll put them back
in the milk bath

14:29.536 --> 14:30.938
for the rest of their lives.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.539
I won't let
that happen.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.606
I need to get
a question to Gray.

14:37.044 --> 14:40.080
Sir, can you ask Gray
what the significance

14:40.113 --> 14:42.582
of the number 99 is?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.386
Tell us about the significance
of the number 99.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.990
Look who's back.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.960
Ask him if it's the number of
senators he has left to kill.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.195
Is that the number of senators
you have left to kill?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.965
Should we be playing
hot or cold?

14:57.965 --> 15:00.200
GLASSER:
Detective, you care to join us?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.038
Is it an address?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.373
Brrr.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.574
I'm getting chilly.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.675
We know the attack
happens indoors.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.110
How much do you know

15:10.143 --> 15:11.311
about viruses, Detective?

15:11.344 --> 15:12.579
No, probably not much.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.982
I don't mind
if you ignore me, Doctor,

15:14.982 --> 15:16.984
your body's answering
the questions.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.152
Will this attack
be localized in D.C.?

15:19.186 --> 15:21.188
(monitor beeping)
Viruses truly are one of
the wonders of the world.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.390
I'll take that as a yes.
Tiny scraps of
genetic material

15:23.423 --> 15:25.058
not even truly alive.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.593
Until they find a host.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.661
What's the target?
The White House?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.397
The Capitol?
They work
their way

15:30.430 --> 15:31.598
through a break in the body--

15:31.631 --> 15:34.134
mouth, nose, cut in the skin.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.003
Then comes the magic.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.570
I'm not seeing anything.
He's trying to calm himself,

15:37.604 --> 15:39.072
confuse the readings.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.407
They'll latch
onto a cell,

15:40.440 --> 15:43.076
force their own DNA inside it,

15:43.110 --> 15:45.378
use your cell as a factory

15:45.412 --> 15:47.480
to make more of them.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.383
So many the cell bursts open,

15:50.417 --> 15:52.352
viruses spilling out,

15:52.385 --> 15:54.221
and the process continues.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.722
The vote's happening today.
They are the oldest
form of life...

15:55.755 --> 15:57.090
We know that's why
you're doing this.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.692
...and they will be here
eons after

15:59.726 --> 16:03.530
you and I are long extinct,
Detective.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.232
How long do we have?

16:05.265 --> 16:07.367
I'm sorry I couldn't
be more helpful.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.169
I do appreciate

16:09.202 --> 16:10.370
your conviction.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.404
Hmm.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.043
No! No, no, no!

16:16.776 --> 16:17.510
No.

16:18.778 --> 16:19.712
Call the medevac!

16:19.746 --> 16:21.048
Call the medics!

16:23.116 --> 16:25.552
Pulse ox 92 on ten liters.
What's in his system?
What did he take?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.554
Looks like a mix of
Mizolpam and Darcopine.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.722
Anesthetics?
Get word to the Hill.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.392
Increase security
at Russell, Dirksen and Hart.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.227
Yes, sir.
Fly him to Gates.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.428
I want a Beemer
system waiting.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.729
What was that,
a suicide capsule?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.131
No, he would've
been dead by now.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.666
He swallowed
a general.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.401
They're taking him to
Gates for a brain imaging.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.702
Well, they don't
need him conscious

16:42.735 --> 16:44.237
to scrub his memory
for clues.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.772
It just doesn't
make any sense.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.241
He's always been one step
ahead, at every turn.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.077
God, I wish they
had seen more.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.678
Yeah, about that...

16:51.711 --> 16:54.447
Detective Vega.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.216
Deputy Blomfeld.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.684
You just missed the fun.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.087
Homeland just took the suspect
to the medi-ship.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.488
You can catch them.
I'm sure Glasser

17:01.521 --> 17:02.722
has a handle on it.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.624
Actually, I'm here
to talk to you.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.498
Fiddler's Neck.
Heard of it?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.101
Yeah, a...
peninsula-turned-island

17:14.134 --> 17:15.835
after the waters rose.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.705
Destination for people
who want to be left alone.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.573
I take it you've been there.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.509
Yeah, once.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.177
There was a tobacco operation.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.545
I made
several arrests.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.114
It's in the report.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.315
Well, it's no wonder

17:28.348 --> 17:29.749
Lieutenant Blake
finds you so impressive.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.651
A city homicide detective

17:31.684 --> 17:33.586
who takes out a vice ring
out in the sticks?

17:35.422 --> 17:37.290
What's this about?
Don't worry.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.491
It's nothing dire.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.759
I was just curious.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.494
While you were
on the island,

17:41.528 --> 17:43.496
did you see any of these folks?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.865
Yeah, the woman,
but not the others.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.267
Who are they?

17:47.300 --> 17:48.568
We pulled their DNA from a cabin

17:48.601 --> 17:50.137
owned by a woman
named Agatha Blaine.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.671
Hmm.
That's not
her real name,

17:51.704 --> 17:53.406
by the way.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.774
We found your DNA
out there, too.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.244
I questioned her
while I was there.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.311
Of course.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.680
(door opens)

18:00.713 --> 18:02.749
Henry, uh...
I'm sorry.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.617
It's not a problem.
I heard about Gray.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.219
I've been asking
Detective Vega here

18:06.253 --> 18:07.687
for a little help
on my new case.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.860
These are
the suspects

18:13.893 --> 18:15.162
you, uh, were
talking about?

18:15.195 --> 18:16.663
Persons
of interest.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.631
And I really appreciate
you letting me use your system

18:18.665 --> 18:19.866
to run the
face search.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.869
No problem.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.705
You haven't
done that yet?

18:25.738 --> 18:28.275
No. These just came
into my possession.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.177
Well, what's wrong
with the D.I.A. system?

18:30.210 --> 18:31.578
You would think
it would have more juice.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.182
Unless this isn't a D.I.A. case.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.384
(clears throat)
The system is all
yours, Henry.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.651
I'll get you
all set up.

18:38.685 --> 18:39.852
Thank you, Lieutenant.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.824
For your cooperation.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.564
He has their faces.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.765
Vega...
He's gonna run them.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.234
Blake told me.
Blake screwed us.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.735
Blake tipped me off.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.837
He told me Blomfeld was coming.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.772
While you were
in with Gray,

18:59.806 --> 19:01.608
I erased all of Dash's
record from the system

19:01.641 --> 19:03.576
and I wiped Arthur's
face from the city feeds.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.379
(exhales)
But...

19:06.413 --> 19:08.381
They need to leave
the city.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.616
Yeah.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.252
What about him?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.587
VEGA:
We need to lose him.

19:14.621 --> 19:15.788
Now, while
Blomfeld's busy.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.324
We?
I'll go first,

19:17.357 --> 19:18.525
through the women's locker room.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.726
If he follows,
let me know.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.228
Pick me up out front.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.235
Yep. You got a stalker.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.869
So there's a Space Blue

19:29.902 --> 19:31.604
leaving D.C. to Barcelona
in two hours.

19:31.638 --> 19:32.805
We don't have
passports.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.707
Now you do.
Pick a name, any name.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.545
Blomfeld knows
what you look like.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.979
He's using Metro servers

19:40.012 --> 19:41.814
to scan the city's
surveillance network,

19:41.848 --> 19:43.716
which means...
Which means we can't
go out in public.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.917
We don't have much time.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.319
We were followed.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.587
Of course you were.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.789
It's okay.
He was easy to lose.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.358
Excuse me, Stretch.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.428
What about Memento Mori?

19:55.462 --> 19:57.897
The feds are scrubbing
Gray's memories for clues,

19:57.930 --> 19:59.766
but it's a shot in the dark.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.768
You still seeing an empty park?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.603
Maybe if we could get to Wally's

20:03.636 --> 20:04.804
and upload my vision...?

20:04.837 --> 20:05.938
No, it's too risky.

20:05.972 --> 20:06.973
Blomfeld is probably
surveilling it.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.742
You all need to get out of here.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.711
Yes, but not
looking like that.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.713
You have to fool
the facial recognition.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.947
You're here to do that for us?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.015
Yeah.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.885
Free of charge.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.588
I'm sorry.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.456
I wish I could do more.

20:23.490 --> 20:26.759
You know how many lives
you've saved, Dash?

20:26.793 --> 20:29.662
Now it's time for you
to let me save yours.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.831
What, by running away
while you run into the fire?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.467
You saying I can't handle it?

20:34.501 --> 20:35.935
(laughs)

20:40.807 --> 20:41.941
(sniffs)

20:47.547 --> 20:48.715
AKEELA:
All right.

20:48.748 --> 20:49.882
Who wants in on the chair first?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.351
No way.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.552
Dash goes first.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.853
Fine. Dash.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.588
It's like dealing with children.

20:55.622 --> 20:56.956
It's fine.
I'll go first.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.328
Where is Dash?

21:01.361 --> 21:03.963
(door opens)

21:07.667 --> 21:09.035
(sighs)

21:09.068 --> 21:10.703
What an idiot.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.342
He's always been
the strongest one.

21:25.918 --> 21:29.422
(crash nearby)

21:29.456 --> 21:30.357
(gasps)

21:31.991 --> 21:34.527
(footfalls approach)

21:36.028 --> 21:38.898
Hello?!

21:49.942 --> 21:53.413
I'm warning you I'm armed!

21:57.850 --> 21:58.885
DASH:
It's me.

22:00.753 --> 22:01.754
No, no, no.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.423
You can't be here.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.425
Blomfeld has this entire street
under surveillance.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.394
Maybe, but he's undermanned.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.695
Who knows how long
until they get here?

22:08.728 --> 22:10.397
Not to mention
where they send us or me?

22:10.397 --> 22:12.399
At least you have
a warm milk bath.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.434
My future is a cold cell.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.035
Are you really trying
to compare misery indexes?

22:16.068 --> 22:18.405
No.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.872
There's gonna be an attack.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.641
Hundreds, maybe thousands
of fatalities.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.109
I need your help to stop it.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.711
Did they destroy our machine?

22:30.550 --> 22:32.419
You coming or not?

22:36.122 --> 22:37.557
What did you see?

22:37.590 --> 22:38.558
A park.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.926
Sorry?

22:39.959 --> 22:41.728
A park and swing.

22:41.761 --> 22:45.432
Agatha and Arthur saw an attack
on a whole bunch of people.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.899
The same thing that happened
to the senator,

22:46.933 --> 22:48.435
but I got nothing.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.802
A minority report?

22:49.836 --> 22:50.903
Or maybe there's more in me

22:50.937 --> 22:52.171
that I just couldn't see yet.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.806
A piece, a detail.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.575
That's why we need to look.

23:09.055 --> 23:12.559
Sir?

23:12.592 --> 23:14.594
Water.
It looks like...

23:14.627 --> 23:17.464
The reservoir.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.965
Mobile command is set up
on the Capitol.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.033
Alpha on the mall,
Beta right here.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.769
Charlie...

23:22.802 --> 23:25.004
You could've told me
you tipped Akeela off.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.474
Things are moving fast
if you haven't noticed.

23:27.474 --> 23:30.142
But if looks could
kill, girl...

23:30.176 --> 23:32.178
Yeah, I'm sorry.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.948
Yes, sir, I'll do it now.
Lieutenant?

23:35.982 --> 23:37.083
We need resources
deployed to reservoirs

23:37.116 --> 23:38.685
and water treatment centers.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.887
Okay, I'll pass it
on upstairs, but why?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.855
The Beemer just pulled
an image from Gray's memory.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.558
The target is
the city's water supply.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.860
I'm getting details now,
hold on.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.862
That doesn't
make any sense.

23:49.896 --> 23:52.198
An attack on the
general population?

23:52.231 --> 23:55.602
I mean, Gray is twisted, sure,
but he has principles.

23:55.635 --> 23:58.871
He wants to save humanity,
not punish it.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.607
What are you saying?
Gray attacked the senator

24:00.640 --> 24:02.742
knowing full well that
he'd get caught, right?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.711
Right.
Gray wanted us to bring him in.

24:04.744 --> 24:06.646
Then stayed silent,
played hard to get.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.881
Why? Why get caught
and then go mute?

24:08.915 --> 24:11.217
I take it you have a theory?

24:11.250 --> 24:12.218
So he could swallow that pill,

24:12.251 --> 24:13.853
knock himself out intentionally,

24:13.886 --> 24:15.522
forcing us to scrub
his brain for memories.

24:15.555 --> 24:16.823
He wanted us to see them.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.891
When means those clues?
The water supply?

24:18.925 --> 24:20.593
That's what
he wanted us to find.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.595
Maybe those aren't images
of the real attack.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.230
Maybe he doesn't
even know the real plan.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.098
Maybe he just filled
his brain with fake ones

24:26.132 --> 24:27.767
to throw us off the scent.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.536
So if Gray sent us
in the wrong direction,

24:29.569 --> 24:30.737
then what's the real target?

24:34.641 --> 24:36.008
The water treatment centers

24:36.042 --> 24:39.011
are located on the outskirts
of the city.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.047
What if he's diverting us there
to clear the area?

24:41.080 --> 24:42.549
Expose us.

24:42.549 --> 24:45.184
The city center.
Exactly.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.219
Akeela, what about those names
I gave you from that tip?

24:47.253 --> 24:48.855
What names?
I ran them.

24:48.888 --> 24:49.956
There's a Donald Smith.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.558
He's a congressman from Iowa.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.025
But it's a very common
last name.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.260
It could be anyone.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.995
What about staff-- janitors, uh,

24:56.028 --> 24:57.597
government employees
in the area?

24:57.630 --> 24:58.998
I'll go run them.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.969
You need to evacuate the Hill.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.170
Is there some intelligence
you want to share?

25:04.203 --> 25:05.237
Where did you get those names?

25:06.739 --> 25:09.308
What if she said
a confidential informant?

25:09.341 --> 25:11.277
I'd make you tell us who that
person was, and if you didn't,

25:11.310 --> 25:12.879
have you arrested for treason.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.814
So... not that.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.649
But you need
to trust her on this.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.317
I do,
but my bosses won't.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.953
Come to me
when you have more.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.589
The names.

25:22.589 --> 25:26.258
Livia Nunez is
aide to Jon Chu.

25:26.292 --> 25:30.262
And Sonya Gianelli
works for Senator Avila.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.964
They're all
staffers.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.233
Memento Mori is
attacking Congress.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.602
Yeah, but how?

25:35.602 --> 25:36.903
It's Gray.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.838
He won't talk to
anybody but you.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.677
Hello?

25:48.615 --> 25:49.982
Hello, Detective.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.017
Nice nap?

25:51.050 --> 25:54.020
Yes, thank you.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.223
I would like to apologize
in advance.

25:57.256 --> 26:00.993
What is about to happen
should have no reflection upon

26:01.027 --> 26:03.262
your tenacity
or intelligence in trying

26:03.295 --> 26:05.632
to stop this attack.
I know you're planning an attack

26:05.665 --> 26:07.634
on Congress.
Oh, you're very good.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.035
Tell me how.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.271
That would just spoil the fun.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.040
Congress.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.175
Get the entire Hill
evacuated now.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.010
Good-bye, Detective.

26:18.044 --> 26:21.280
I do hope that you come to see
that this is for the best.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.315
Wait...
(hangs up)

26:27.186 --> 26:29.656
Good work, Detective.
You were right.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.060
He just told us.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.662
Why would he tell us?

26:39.699 --> 26:44.136
(grunts)

26:44.170 --> 26:47.173
My new detail is a girl
hopping off a swing?

26:47.206 --> 26:49.208
Damn it.
Wally, what is going on?

26:49.241 --> 26:51.110
Why can't I see more?
If it's really

26:51.143 --> 26:53.680
a minority report,
that means there's another path

26:53.713 --> 26:55.047
the future might
still take.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.683
Or we're just not seeing enough.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.184
Let's do it again.
Dash.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.286
We don't have time.
You need to go.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.188
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.826
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Wallace.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.295
But it seems that
we left something behind.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.698
You.

27:22.408 --> 27:23.743
(zapping)

27:23.776 --> 27:24.977
(grunts)

27:29.916 --> 27:31.283
(door opens)

27:35.021 --> 27:36.856
Agatha?

27:36.889 --> 27:39.058
It's been a long time, Wally.

27:41.127 --> 27:44.130
So you want to get the band
back together?

27:46.899 --> 27:50.737
Hey.
Can you hear me?

27:50.737 --> 27:53.072
We don't have a lot of time,
so listen carefully.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.074
We know you have a photonic
containment system.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.076
We've seen
the plans.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.978
Our best chance of
stopping this attack

27:59.011 --> 28:01.781
is by putting all three of
us into the bath together.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.382
Wait, you want to help?

28:03.415 --> 28:04.751
Our way.

28:04.751 --> 28:05.952
Well, you could have just asked

28:05.985 --> 28:07.186
and spared us the 50,000 volts.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.254
We don't trust you.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.122
You and your men will take us

28:10.156 --> 28:12.759
to the milk bath and get us in
without alerting the D.I.A.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.761
We know that they're
not tracking you

28:14.761 --> 28:16.028
because you're
freelancing.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.897
Whatever vision we
see as a hive mind

28:17.930 --> 28:19.866
will be conveyed
to the authorities.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.333
To Detective Vega.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.235
By me.
And she'll take
it from there.

28:23.269 --> 28:26.138
And if you and your friend
try anything,

28:26.172 --> 28:27.774
you answer to them.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.480
Do we have a deal?

28:35.915 --> 28:37.316
Yeah.

28:39.185 --> 28:42.288
If that's what it takes
to stop an attack, fine.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.290
I'm a patriot first.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.492
Good.
We're walking.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.933
Come on, everybody in.
As safely and as fast

28:53.966 --> 28:56.002
as you can, please.

28:56.035 --> 28:59.205
This way, this way, please,
everyone, this way.
Step in, please.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.173
It's not a drill
but don't panic, please.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.241
There's room
here to the right.
Senator.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.843
Keep going.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.078
When was this built, 2010?

29:06.112 --> 29:07.279
AMAN:
This way, please, this way.

29:07.313 --> 29:08.414
MAN:
Everyone into the room, please.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.816
Right this way, ma'am.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.150
Just take a seat over here.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.820
Can we get some air in here?
It's boiling.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.922
(phone ringing)
Who is it?

29:15.955 --> 29:16.989
Dash.

29:17.023 --> 29:18.024
What are you doing?

29:18.057 --> 29:19.225
You can't be calling me.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.260
It's okay.
We're going in.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.261
Going in?

29:22.294 --> 29:23.495
The milk bath.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.097
The milk bath? Dash,

29:25.131 --> 29:26.165
what about Blomfeld?

29:26.198 --> 29:27.233
He won't be a problem.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.835
We have him
under control.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.870
(door opens)
I got to go.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.839
Stay by the phone.
We'll be in touch.

29:32.839 --> 29:34.206
Dash.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.242
Dash.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.519
Wicked déjà vu.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.555
Yeah.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.328
(indistinct chatter)

29:59.431 --> 30:02.168
You wanted the Precogs?
You got 'em.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.569
What do you mean?

30:03.602 --> 30:05.104
They have Blomfeld.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.438
They're gonna help us.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.612
MAN:
Get some water here, please.

30:13.645 --> 30:17.249
(indistinct conversations)

30:17.283 --> 30:18.350
Sir.
Thank you.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.386
Thanks.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.590
Okay.
Unfortunately,

30:24.623 --> 30:26.258
you guys know the drill.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.229
No drugs.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.463
You have to.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.199
The pain
would be unbearable.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.301
It would interfere
with what you see.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.969
Your mind needs to be clear.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.906
Take it, Arthur.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.877
We are so never
gonna be even for this.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.247
(grunts)

30:53.285 --> 30:55.287
(grunts)

31:03.595 --> 31:05.564
Agatha.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.599
It's okay.

31:12.138 --> 31:14.140
(soft gasp)

31:31.023 --> 31:34.060
*

31:35.461 --> 31:37.997
They're fully sedated.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.067
(sighs):
Here goes.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.004
(grunting)

31:45.037 --> 31:46.605
(pants)

31:56.015 --> 31:57.616
WALLY: Okay...
okay, we're getting something.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.118
Vega, can you see it?

31:59.151 --> 32:00.987
VEGA:
I'm not recognizing anyone.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.389
Yeah, well, who can with
their faces like that?
And if it is

32:03.422 --> 32:05.491
the congress,
they'd be safe by now--
they're in a bunker.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.994
Wally, the number 99.

32:07.994 --> 32:10.062
I see it. Looks like
a readout of some kind.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.363
I can't tell what it is.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.199
What about Dash,
is he getting anything?

32:13.232 --> 32:15.634
WALLY (sighs):
Nothing. It's like...

32:15.667 --> 32:17.003
he can't see it.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.704
(splashing)

32:18.737 --> 32:19.738
Hang on.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.307
(low grunt)

32:22.274 --> 32:24.476
It's the same thing. A park.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.378
What was that?

32:26.412 --> 32:27.213
Go back.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.348
Wait. There.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.017
A hand.

32:31.017 --> 32:33.652
Hold it. Hold it.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.361
Stackhouse Park.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.495
Capitol Hill.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.631
Next-door
to the Senate office building.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.366
You said the entire congress

32:47.399 --> 32:49.501
was evacuated to a bunker.
Where?

32:49.535 --> 32:52.038
Underground.
No one knows exactly.

32:52.038 --> 32:54.340
Maybe directly
underneath the park.

32:54.373 --> 32:55.707
We need a map of the tunnel.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.409
I don't have
the clearance.

32:57.443 --> 33:00.079
Call Shale and tell him to get
everyone out of there now.

33:00.112 --> 33:04.516
Lara. You're
gonna convince them
based on whose intel?

33:04.550 --> 33:06.452
I sent them down there.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.754
I sent them into the bunker.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.257
This is my fault.

33:18.064 --> 33:20.732
*

33:21.767 --> 33:23.435
(pants)

33:30.176 --> 33:31.477
The swing.

33:32.544 --> 33:33.479
There.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.315
Get me Special Agent Glasser.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.185
I need him right now.
Right now!

33:44.723 --> 33:46.425
He's alive.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.296
(gasping breaths, grunting)

33:53.099 --> 33:55.267
*

34:10.782 --> 34:11.783
Hey!

34:11.817 --> 34:13.419
(indistinct chatter)
MAN:
Please!

34:20.526 --> 34:22.361
(clanging in distance)

34:27.533 --> 34:30.236
(air whooshing)

34:38.844 --> 34:40.446
(weapons firing)

34:42.614 --> 34:43.782
Freeze!

34:43.815 --> 34:45.151
(weapon's high-pitched whirring)

34:50.156 --> 34:52.491
(gurgling)

34:56.495 --> 34:58.197
(continues gurgling)

34:58.230 --> 35:00.399
(crackling)

35:05.571 --> 35:07.273
(whooshing stops)

35:07.306 --> 35:10.209
(all groaning)

35:10.242 --> 35:12.278
I need a Hazmat unit,
Stackhouse Park.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.246
Wally.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.647
It's over.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.549
They did it.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.686
They did it.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.690
(light splash)

35:24.723 --> 35:26.192
Get them out
of that milk bath, Wally.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.226
Get them out of the city.

35:27.259 --> 35:30.762
(Precogs gasping, grunting)

35:32.698 --> 35:34.200
Oh, no.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.367
What's happening?

35:35.401 --> 35:36.568
They're having another one.

35:40.939 --> 35:43.209
(grunting)

35:49.981 --> 35:51.483
(echoing scream)

35:52.418 --> 35:54.620
(gunshot)

36:00.426 --> 36:02.294
(bones crack)

36:03.962 --> 36:04.963
Wally?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.732
Wally!
What is it?

36:06.765 --> 36:08.567
I don't know.
You need to stay here,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.602
wait for the Hazmat.
Lara.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.304
Be careful.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.874
Call Thurn-Tippett.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.277
Tell them we've got
the whole package.

36:19.911 --> 36:21.380
You liar.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.482
You're selling them?
How much?

36:23.515 --> 36:24.783
This was never about the money.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.652
I did it for our country,
its future.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.556
But yeah... I'll do all right.

36:49.308 --> 36:51.377
*

36:55.881 --> 36:58.817
Words fall short, gentlemen.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.353
Who wants to do the honors?

37:01.387 --> 37:04.656
We got to up their doses
for their long trip.

37:06.725 --> 37:07.659
(yells)

37:08.694 --> 37:10.829
You bastard!
You killed her!

37:12.464 --> 37:13.432
(indistinct shouting)

37:14.900 --> 37:17.303
(electrical zapping)

37:19.638 --> 37:22.040
DASH:
Arthur, stop.

37:22.073 --> 37:25.444
DASH:
Arthur, cut it out! Hey! Hey!
AGATHA: Do not kill him! Arthur!

37:25.477 --> 37:27.413
Arthur, no!
Arthur, stop!

37:27.446 --> 37:29.781
He killed her!

37:30.482 --> 37:32.384
(zapping)

37:41.560 --> 37:43.429
(quiet gasp)

37:43.462 --> 37:45.564
No... no...

37:45.597 --> 37:47.499
No. No, no, no, no.

37:47.533 --> 37:48.934
No, no, no. No.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.936
No. Please. No.
(pants)

37:50.969 --> 37:54.673
(coughing)

37:54.706 --> 37:58.009
(rapid panting)

37:58.043 --> 38:00.412
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.416
(panting slows)

38:06.017 --> 38:08.387
(soft exhale)

38:09.721 --> 38:12.023
(sniffling)

38:17.062 --> 38:19.498
Is everyone okay?

38:19.531 --> 38:20.566
They betrayed us.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.834
But we were ready.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.471
Ready?
She's dead.

38:25.504 --> 38:28.507
Did you see that
coming, too?
I told you

38:28.540 --> 38:30.075
everything I saw.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.745
I'm so sorry.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.981
Did you stop it?

38:36.014 --> 38:38.450
Yes.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.085
You did.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.920
(footfalls approaching)

38:41.953 --> 38:43.422
Wally.
Agatha.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.391
You're okay.
Thank goodness.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.925
No, you can't be here.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.395
The buyers are
on their way.

38:49.428 --> 38:52.698
Buyers?
Blomfeld's selling them
to a third party.

38:54.900 --> 38:58.504
Get dressed. I need
to get you three out of here.

38:58.537 --> 38:59.671
What about them?

39:09.781 --> 39:11.817
Put them in.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.829
WALLY:
What do we do when they wake up?

39:23.862 --> 39:26.164
How about they don't?

39:26.197 --> 39:28.834
Wally, how long will these
drugs keep them out?

39:28.867 --> 39:31.002
High dose?
Two or three days.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.704
That'll give you a head start.
If we're lucky,

39:32.738 --> 39:34.139
they'll wake up
with a little amnesia,

39:34.172 --> 39:36.107
the last few hours
won't be clear, but...

39:36.141 --> 39:38.710
don't count on it.
There's
a more permanent amnesia.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.011
We are not killing them.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.880
They wanted
to enslave us.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.782
Arthur's right.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.017
They're the only ones
who know our faces.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.454
Yours, too, Vega.
DASH:
So at the end of the day,

39:48.454 --> 39:49.655
we are no different
from them?

39:49.688 --> 39:51.757
You're unbelievable.
No.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.692
I'll take the heat.
Tell everybody the truth.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.461
Maybe they'll arrest me;
I don't care.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.696
By then all of you will
be far away and safe.
But when

39:57.729 --> 39:59.465
they scrub your brain
to find clues about us?

39:59.498 --> 40:01.700
They won't tell them
where you are...

40:01.733 --> 40:03.969
because I won't know.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.847
I won't let you
do that. No way.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.783
It's the only way.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.653
Listen to your partner.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.890
(laughs softly)

40:40.506 --> 40:42.908
Arthur...
I can't let them
get away with that.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.210
Arthur...
VEGA:
No, no, don't!

40:45.243 --> 40:48.146
(Dash and Agatha gasping,
grunting)

40:49.881 --> 40:51.983
(gasping breaths)
(Dash groaning)

40:57.856 --> 40:59.625
VEGA:
Arthur!

41:08.600 --> 41:10.636
*

41:37.328 --> 41:39.030
Run.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.834
Run!

41:42.868 --> 41:45.136
*
