-Only one thing
can stop these wolves.

The wolves,
they are doing the cringes.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.651
-It's Robin's song.
-[wolves squeal]

10:08.695 --> 10:10.653

-Now that's how you take
the energy out of a crowd.
-Thanks, Robin.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.977
We never could have made
the wolves cringe that hard.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.240
I hope you now understand
the importance

10:32.283 --> 10:34.677
of making campfires
stilted, boring

10:34.721 --> 10:35.896
and cringe-worthy, Titans.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.854
So we don't wake up the wolves.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.421
Or the...
