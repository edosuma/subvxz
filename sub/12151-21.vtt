00:01.929 --> 00:04.320
- Previously on Angel:
- Go find others like you.

00:06.730 --> 00:09.890
I'm not your boyfriend. Find somebody
else to smack you around.

00:10.330 --> 00:13.000
Wesley's taking the baby away,
for good.

00:15.730 --> 00:17.059
I'm your father.

00:18.129 --> 00:22.629
What you're looking into is
the Quor-toth, darkest of the dark worlds.

00:23.530 --> 00:25.989
To punch through to Quor-toth
would require dark magics.

00:26.530 --> 00:30.920
There's always some cosmic
price to using primordial powers.

00:33.130 --> 00:34.359
- Hi, Dad.
- Connor?

00:34.929 --> 00:37.600
- My name is Steven.
- Listen to me.

00:37.929 --> 00:39.859
A couple weeks ago, he was
in diapers. Now he's a teenager?

00:40.329 --> 00:41.200
No!

00:41.530 --> 00:43.320
I lost you once already,
but you're back.

00:43.929 --> 00:45.649
- You're not alone.
- I know.

00:46.329 --> 00:49.100
We just sit here with a fissure
from the hell dimension in the lobby?

00:49.329 --> 00:51.929
- It's closed.
- Did anything else come in?

00:52.329 --> 00:53.200
Hi, Dad.

00:54.729 --> 00:58.630
- Still no answer on his cell phone.
- If only he knew how to use it.

00:59.530 --> 01:02.159
Maybe we should head back out,
try to pick up the trail.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.549
- A wise plan. I'll assist with tracking.
- No.

01:05.530 --> 01:07.879
But if something
is looking for Connor...

01:08.530 --> 01:11.620
- ...and if Angel did find him--
- He did.

01:12.730 --> 01:13.599
- Angel.
- Oh, my God.

01:13.930 --> 01:15.329
- You're hurt.
- I'm okay.

01:15.730 --> 01:17.170
- You found him?
- Yeah.

01:17.530 --> 01:18.609
And?

01:18.730 --> 01:19.780
And...

01:21.129 --> 01:22.640
...we talked.

01:24.730 --> 01:27.010
Looks like he talks with his hands.

01:27.730 --> 01:30.120
He didn't do this to me.
Not most of it, anyway.

01:30.730 --> 01:33.049
So that kid really was Connor?

01:33.129 --> 01:36.459
Steven. His name's Steven now.

01:40.329 --> 01:42.150
He's still my son.

01:42.730 --> 01:47.120
- So where is he?
- I'm not sure.

01:48.730 --> 01:51.329
But he knows where I am.
He'll be fine.

01:51.730 --> 01:55.209
- Actually, he might not be.
- What do you mean?

01:56.530 --> 02:00.180
Something may have escaped from
Quor-toth before we closed the portal.

02:00.730 --> 02:03.120
Lorne's dimensional-magic expert
was picking up bad vibes.

02:03.730 --> 02:07.590
- Nobody saw anything else come out?
- Well, not exactly.

02:07.930 --> 02:10.878
- If my son was the last thing through....
- Right.

02:11.530 --> 02:14.650
What if it was some vengeance-y
else thing that's after Connor?

02:15.729 --> 02:18.819
He survived Quor-toth this long.
He can take care of himself.

02:19.330 --> 02:22.699
So he survived an unspeakable
hell dimension. Who hasn't?

02:23.530 --> 02:26.129
You can't just leave him alone
in Los Angeles.

02:26.530 --> 02:28.599
He's gotta come back on his own.

02:28.930 --> 02:31.979
He will, just as soon as he realizes
what he needs.

02:33.129 --> 02:35.340
And what's that?

02:37.330 --> 02:38.340
A father.

02:39.729 --> 02:40.780
A room.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.469
I need a room for me and my father.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074

04:19.850 --> 04:22.519
I found food
in a big metal box outside.

04:24.649 --> 04:25.769
Dad?

04:31.850 --> 04:34.060
Good boy. You got it.

04:35.449 --> 04:38.120
Now, let's have a look at the date.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.529
Days.

04:46.850 --> 04:48.360
We've been gone only days.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.439
I don't like this place.
So many people....

04:52.850 --> 04:54.360
It's not like home.

04:54.649 --> 04:57.279
Quor-toth was never our home.
It was our prison.

05:00.649 --> 05:02.790
I should've known that one day
you'd find a way out.

05:03.050 --> 05:05.930
Cracks were there already.

05:06.649 --> 05:08.680
I just made the sluks show me.

05:09.050 --> 05:12.769
Frightened rats,
forced to flee to daylight.

05:14.449 --> 05:16.550
My boy's smart.

05:18.050 --> 05:22.189
- You shouldn't have followed me here.
- How could I not?

05:24.649 --> 05:28.339
I would have come back to you
after I killed him.

05:30.649 --> 05:32.300
I'm sorry I couldn't.

05:33.050 --> 05:35.470
Of course you couldn't.
It's not in you.

05:36.050 --> 05:40.189
- I've killed lots.
- Only when you had to. Only to survive.

05:40.850 --> 05:45.170
And that's not the real reason
why you worked so hard to get here.

05:46.850 --> 05:49.449
- You wanted to see him.
- No.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.290
There's no shame in it.
I knew this day would come.

05:54.050 --> 05:55.589
That's why I've never lied to you.

05:55.850 --> 06:00.199
I have always told you the truth
about what your parents were...

06:01.250 --> 06:03.639
- ...how you and I came to be together.
- God gave me to you.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.990
Yes. God delivered you to me
that I might keep you safe...

06:07.250 --> 06:09.990
...and lavish upon you the love
I could never give my first children.

06:10.850 --> 06:13.310
- Because he took them from you.
- Right.

06:14.449 --> 06:17.079
I wish I had killed him.

06:17.449 --> 06:23.069
If you had, then you wouldn't be the boy
I'd raised, or the man I know you'll be.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.149
There's more to learn, Steven.

06:27.050 --> 06:29.959
- And I want to.
- Good.

06:33.649 --> 06:35.720
Then you must go to him.

06:36.050 --> 06:39.170
- What?
- Walk in his world. Learn all you can.

06:40.250 --> 06:44.920
Discover what of him is in you,
that you might fight against it.

06:45.649 --> 06:48.839
But be on your guard.
Remember what I've taught you.

06:49.250 --> 06:54.269
The devil will show you bright things.
Many colors.

06:57.050 --> 07:01.120
I had to get it enchanted.
Cedrian crystals don't come that way.

07:01.850 --> 07:03.079
- Will it work?
- It should.

07:03.649 --> 07:06.810
Cedrian crystals contain millennia
of stored mystical energy.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.600
And it's about the size
of a D battery.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.389
- That's gorgeous.
- And priceless.

07:13.250 --> 07:17.079
Though in this instance, priceless
meaning "without price." As in free.

07:17.449 --> 07:19.769
A six-horned Lach-nie Hag
owed me a favor.

07:20.449 --> 07:22.660
- Don't ask.
- I meant that.

07:23.449 --> 07:27.139
- Standard issue Geiger counter.
- We picked it up at a yard sale.

07:27.649 --> 07:28.519
Shiny.

07:28.850 --> 07:31.620
- What's its purpose?
- To see what came through the portal.

07:31.850 --> 07:35.610
Anything from Quor-toth should've left
a kind of para-plasmic radioactivity.

07:36.649 --> 07:40.649
Of course, I'm assuming that everything
in nature seeks a relaxed or stable state.

07:41.449 --> 07:42.850
I know I do.

07:43.850 --> 07:45.009
Hey.

07:46.250 --> 07:49.870
- So how is he?
- Still being all mature.

07:50.449 --> 07:52.660
- Really? Where?
- Upstairs.

07:54.050 --> 07:56.149
I'm gonna go talk to him.

08:08.449 --> 08:11.930
So I guess Fred's working on a way...

08:12.649 --> 08:16.129
...to determine if anything else
came out of the portal.

08:18.649 --> 08:20.259
That's good.

08:22.250 --> 08:26.600
So maybe if we're very lucky, later
today we'll be able to kill something.

08:27.050 --> 08:30.310
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Sure.

08:31.250 --> 08:35.429
Well, I just wanted to check in,
let you know I was on the clock...

08:36.049 --> 08:40.299
...and tell you that you're doing
the right thing.

08:46.850 --> 08:49.100
What if he doesn't come back?

08:57.529 --> 09:00.299
Hey, something troubling you, bubby?

09:01.129 --> 09:04.250
- Indeed. I am confused.
- About what?

09:04.730 --> 09:08.379
Angel. His inaction puzzles me.
When Connor was taken from him...

09:09.529 --> 09:12.340
- ...he moved heaven and Tarkna.
- He sure did.

09:12.529 --> 09:14.389
Hence our weekly scrubbing
of the lobby floor.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.490
Now that his son is here,
he does nothing.

09:17.929 --> 09:19.820
Sometimes nothing
is the best something.

09:20.330 --> 09:24.370
If a thing's meant to be,
sometimes it's best not to force it.

09:25.129 --> 09:28.429
If a thing is meant to be,
then how can it be forced?

09:29.330 --> 09:32.100
- I guess it can't.
- And if a thing is not meant to be?

09:32.929 --> 09:34.049
Well, then it really can't.

09:34.129 --> 09:38.659
Just 'cause someone hops a dimension
is no guarantee things will work out.

09:40.730 --> 09:43.889
Well, aren't you just sneaky
with the subtext.

09:50.330 --> 09:53.700
It is a beautiful day.
If my princess asks...

09:54.529 --> 09:57.159
...tell her I have gone for a walk.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.940
If she asks.

10:08.330 --> 10:12.509
He feels further away from me now
than when he was first taken.

10:13.129 --> 10:17.480
All that time, I don't think I ever
really believed that I lost him.

10:18.529 --> 10:22.879
Not really. Then he shows up again,
and I knew I had.

10:23.929 --> 10:28.879
- It's only temporary.
- Yeah. Everything's temporary.

10:31.129 --> 10:35.659
There's just so much I thought we'd
be able to do together before he....

10:36.529 --> 10:39.690
- Grew up?
- Hated me.

10:41.330 --> 10:45.120
Angel, he doesn't hate you.
He doesn't even know you.

10:47.330 --> 10:50.659
But he will.
He's gonna come back, Angel.

10:51.529 --> 10:55.500
- How do you know?
- Because he has to.

10:57.529 --> 10:59.809
Because he's family.

11:34.129 --> 11:37.750
Getting a good, strong reading here.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.820
Should we be wearing lead?
'Cause I actually have something.

11:41.929 --> 11:43.860
This is where the portal was...

11:44.330 --> 11:49.389
...so it makes sense that I'd be
getting a reading here. Mark that.

11:56.929 --> 12:01.600
Okay, looks like something
might have come in here, or...

12:03.529 --> 12:05.210
...here.

12:05.929 --> 12:07.889
Wait a minute.

12:08.330 --> 12:12.610
Wow. Something here is pretty...

12:14.330 --> 12:15.909
...hot.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.820
Angel's son. Hi!

12:20.330 --> 12:23.070
I didn't mean to click at you.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.950
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:40.129 --> 12:44.629
I thought I'd come by, like you said.

12:46.129 --> 12:48.159
Glad you did.

12:49.730 --> 12:52.850
Everyone, this is Steven.

12:53.330 --> 12:57.049
Steven, this is Fred, that's Gunn,
Cordelia, and that's Lorne.

12:58.129 --> 12:59.639
Hello, young man.

12:59.929 --> 13:02.389
So are we about done here?

13:02.929 --> 13:08.590
- I think we've covered everything.
- Maybe we could take this outside.

13:09.529 --> 13:12.580
We'll do a perimeter search,
then recalibrate for wider areas.

13:13.730 --> 13:15.870
That'd be a good idea.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.220
It was very nice to meet you, Steven.

13:20.929 --> 13:24.370
Yeah, I have a thing.

13:25.730 --> 13:30.580
I'll just be sure to hold
all your calls. You just--

13:31.129 --> 13:33.620
- You guys take your time.
- Thanks.

13:48.529 --> 13:50.070
So....

13:54.529 --> 13:56.419
You hungry?

13:57.529 --> 13:59.389
What do you have?

14:01.129 --> 14:04.460
- We can go out.
- What? Where?

14:05.330 --> 14:08.950
- Cordy?
- It's a bar! Vampires! A gang of them!

14:09.529 --> 14:10.690
Angel, can you hear me?

14:11.929 --> 14:14.460
I can see her. A woman. Angel!

14:15.529 --> 14:19.570
She's all alone.
She doesn't see them.

14:20.330 --> 14:23.000
- Angel, you have to hurry!
- Slow down.

14:27.529 --> 14:30.090
There's a woman at a bar.
Vampires are after her.

14:30.529 --> 14:33.860
- You have to help her.
- So much for holding my calls.

14:34.730 --> 14:36.690
- Sorry.
- Listen...

14:38.929 --> 14:41.490
- ...I have to go out for a while.
- It's okay.

14:41.929 --> 14:43.580
- It's kind of my job.
- Yeah, whatever.

14:43.730 --> 14:46.820
It could be kind of dangerous.
There's killing and violence.

14:47.330 --> 14:49.259
You wanna come?

15:25.450 --> 15:28.009
See you got my invitation.

15:29.049 --> 15:30.309
Lilah.

15:32.049 --> 15:33.240
Obviously.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.370
I thought the "come alone"
was a particularly ironic touch.

15:37.450 --> 15:39.450
I mean, how else would you come?

15:39.850 --> 15:43.610
Don't rush off. Just look over there.

15:44.649 --> 15:48.059
I went through a lot of trouble
to arrange this show for you.

15:50.649 --> 15:51.809
Goodbye.

15:52.450 --> 15:55.929
Leave now, and you'll miss
her big death scene.

15:58.450 --> 16:02.169
Wouldn't you like to see the bitch that
slit your throat and left you to die...

16:02.649 --> 16:04.970
- ...get a little of her own back?
- What's going on?

16:05.649 --> 16:07.539
Some source, can't imagine who...

16:08.049 --> 16:11.490
...tipped her off that this place
would be filthy with vampires.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.990
Which, as it turns out, is true.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.549
Right. Because that same source...

16:18.850 --> 16:21.269
...tipped off the vampires
that she'd be here.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.200
She has been pissing off a lot
of un-dead Americans.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.100
And you thought I'd enjoy
a box seat for her slaughter?

16:27.850 --> 16:30.200
Well, yeah.

16:31.450 --> 16:35.450
- You don't know a thing about me.
- Probably not.

16:36.850 --> 16:41.730
Like, will he go straight to his car,
or will he stop to warn her first?

16:44.049 --> 16:47.070
He has to think about it.
That's good.

16:47.649 --> 16:52.070
That's all I really needed to know.
You can go.

16:55.450 --> 16:59.029
- A test, Lilah?
- Don't look so grim.

16:59.649 --> 17:01.970
I needed to know
if I was wasting my time.

17:02.649 --> 17:07.039
To prove we're friends, I'll pull her
out before anything lethal happens.

17:08.049 --> 17:12.440
So you don't have to torture yourself
as to whether you did the right thing.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.358
I don't think that will be necessary.

17:23.049 --> 17:26.240
You wanted to kill a vampire.
This might be your chance.

17:26.650 --> 17:30.440
- Make sure you go straight for--
- The heart. My father taught me.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.549
Yeah, I'm sure he did.
There are innocent people here.

17:33.849 --> 17:36.309
Don't nail anyone until
they show their game face.

17:36.849 --> 17:40.109
- Will it look like yours did?
- Yeah.

17:41.650 --> 17:42.660
So why do you do it?

17:43.450 --> 17:44.609
Do what?

17:45.250 --> 17:47.950
Why kill them if they're like you?

17:49.450 --> 17:53.279
- They're not like me, Connor.
- I'm not Connor.

17:54.849 --> 17:56.220
- Another?
- Stay there.

17:56.650 --> 17:58.930
- No, I'm done.
- You're not wrong.

17:59.650 --> 18:01.900
- She thinks she's a slayer.
- She'll learn different.

18:24.849 --> 18:26.740
Nice! Take the one on the--

18:28.450 --> 18:30.170
Well, yeah, that makes the most sense.

18:32.650 --> 18:35.109
Who's the boy wonder?

18:36.849 --> 18:39.900
- He moves just like--
- His father.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.140
Go! Get out of here!

18:50.650 --> 18:51.589
Go!

19:11.049 --> 19:14.170
Now tell me you're not interested.

20:05.529 --> 20:07.920
They don't need to breathe
or make any sound.

20:08.529 --> 20:10.250
You gotta be careful.

20:12.130 --> 20:14.519
You know, you were good in there.

20:15.730 --> 20:18.539
I mean, normally I'd take you
to a ball game or a museum...

20:18.730 --> 20:20.240
...or something.

20:20.529 --> 20:24.740
It's just good to know that you
can handle yourself in a fight.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.099
It's good to know you can do that too.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.210
Whoa.

21:03.849 --> 21:05.710
Father.

21:08.650 --> 21:10.160
He was everything that you said.

21:10.450 --> 21:14.450
He tried to deceive me by saving
people, but it didn't work.

21:15.849 --> 21:19.990
- I've seen his true face.
- And I've seen yours.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.119
The kid was born for it,

21:23.049 --> 21:26.670
The way he anticipated....
I'm telling you, it's in his blood.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.230
You don't say.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.910
It was like we had never been apart.

21:31.450 --> 21:34.400
He felt it too. I know he did.
You should've seen us.

21:35.650 --> 21:36.630
I did.

21:37.450 --> 21:39.269
What do you mean, you did?

21:41.049 --> 21:43.930
After you left,
I went back into my vision.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.509
You went back in?

21:46.450 --> 21:47.710
Don't ask me how.

21:48.250 --> 21:51.619
I don't know if it's a part of my new
semi-demon-ness...

21:52.450 --> 21:55.220
...or if they just let me go back in.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.589
But I was there.

21:58.450 --> 22:02.099
I saw the whole thing.
You and your son together.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.930
It was beautiful.

22:05.049 --> 22:07.079
- Stop saying that,
- It's true, son.

22:08.049 --> 22:09.630
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

22:09.849 --> 22:13.819
Anyone who saw you together would
realize it's where you're meant to be.

22:14.650 --> 22:15.559
- At his side.
- No!

22:15.849 --> 22:18.619
Your need for him drove you
across the dimensions.

22:19.450 --> 22:22.190
- I don't need him!
- Go back to him, Steven.

22:24.250 --> 22:26.950
Why are you doing this? Why?

22:27.849 --> 22:29.180
God gave me to you.

22:29.650 --> 22:32.140
Yes. It was God's plan
for us to be together.

22:32.650 --> 22:35.349
Nothing will ever persuade me
otherwise.

22:36.250 --> 22:39.339
But now it's time for me
to give you back.

22:40.450 --> 22:43.960
- He's a demon.
- You're the bastard son of two demons.

22:44.650 --> 22:46.119
- Then I'm a demon.
- You're not.

22:46.450 --> 22:49.150
God help me,
I don't know what you are...

22:50.049 --> 22:54.089
...but I am not the one to give you
answers. And there are answers.

22:54.849 --> 22:56.990
Go and find them out.

22:58.450 --> 23:02.140
Except for the hotel, the strongest
emissions are coming from this vicinity.

23:02.650 --> 23:06.269
Now what? Do we go door to door and
ask if anyone's seen any bogies?

23:07.450 --> 23:10.539
I'm not sure. I don't even know if
we should be looking above ground.

23:11.049 --> 23:13.930
You told me not to be deceived,
but you've let yourself be deceived.

23:14.650 --> 23:16.400
If I could stop this, I would, son.

23:17.049 --> 23:20.029
But we were brought here by forces
beyond our control.

23:20.650 --> 23:21.700
You're wrong.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.019
Hey.

23:25.450 --> 23:27.130
Check it out.

23:30.250 --> 23:32.849
We've been following Angel's
son's emissions the whole time.

23:33.849 --> 23:36.339
There's a sentence I don't ever
need to hear again.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.109
But it's good, right?

23:38.650 --> 23:40.970
No big scary came out of the portal.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.829
How about a short scary?

23:57.210 --> 23:58.890
Hey, kiddo. Didn't see you.

23:59.009 --> 24:01.710
Looking for your dad?
Come on, he's upstairs.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.259
I'll show you the room.

24:06.210 --> 24:10.109
- This way.
- I'm not going with you, demon.

24:11.609 --> 24:13.359
I'll tell you what.

24:14.009 --> 24:16.779
Since you were raised in a hell
dimension by a psychopath...

24:17.609 --> 24:21.329
...and since I know something
about that, we'll let that slide.

24:21.809 --> 24:25.039
- I'll fetch your pop for you.
- Filthy demon.

24:26.609 --> 24:29.029
Actually, that's
"Uncle Filthy Demon" to you.

24:29.609 --> 24:32.309
A week ago, I was changing
your diapers, you little pr--

24:33.210 --> 24:34.509
Hey.

24:35.609 --> 24:37.289
What's the problem?

24:41.009 --> 24:42.900
Steven?

24:47.009 --> 24:48.900
Steven.

24:53.609 --> 24:55.819
You haven't been
in this world very long...

24:56.009 --> 24:58.779
...and I imagine things are pretty
Wild West-y where you're from...

25:00.210 --> 25:02.769
...but Lorne's a good guy.
Honestly.

25:03.809 --> 25:07.069
- It's a demon.
- Right, true. He is.

25:07.410 --> 25:10.890
But demon doesn't always mean
evil in this dimension.

25:11.609 --> 25:12.869
I mean, look at me.

25:15.210 --> 25:17.210
Well, I'm part demon.

25:18.210 --> 25:20.460
Yeah. By choice.

25:21.809 --> 25:25.460
I did it to help people, and so that
the back of my head wouldn't explode--

25:31.049 --> 25:32.839
Cordy!

25:48.450 --> 25:50.839
Let it go, honey.

25:54.450 --> 25:56.869
Just let it go.

25:57.450 --> 25:59.339
You don't need that.

26:01.049 --> 26:03.470
You don't need any of that.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.390
That's right.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.490
Just let it go, baby.

26:15.450 --> 26:18.710
It's okay, sweetie.

26:20.250 --> 26:23.690
That's right. It's okay.

26:25.049 --> 26:27.079
I know.

26:30.450 --> 26:32.519
It's okay.

26:52.650 --> 26:54.509
How do you feel?

26:55.049 --> 26:56.240
Okay.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.869
Drained, but okay.

27:01.049 --> 27:03.819
Well, you got some serious
mojo going on, girl.

27:04.650 --> 27:07.839
The deal you struck with The Powers,
they gave you the full package.

27:08.849 --> 27:10.359
All the extras.

27:10.650 --> 27:14.339
That kid was toxic when he came here
tonight. Heavy on the "ick."

27:14.849 --> 27:17.940
- What actually happened out there?
- In my professional opinion?

27:18.450 --> 27:21.779
Miss Demon-y Britches gave
that child some kind of soul colonic.

27:22.650 --> 27:24.579
- Flushed him out.
- Flushed what out?

27:25.049 --> 27:27.509
It was that place.
Quor-toth.

27:28.650 --> 27:31.769
It crept into every part of him.
He was sick with it.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.460
- Fred's readings--
- He nearly broke the needle.

27:35.250 --> 27:39.569
My guess? She wouldn't even get
so much as a click off of him now.

27:43.650 --> 27:44.880
Thank you.

27:46.049 --> 27:48.190
Thank you for doing this for him.

27:50.849 --> 27:55.269
I know what it was like for him there.
The darkness and confusion.

27:56.250 --> 27:58.920
He thought it was where he belonged.

28:05.849 --> 28:07.289
Hey, pal.

28:08.849 --> 28:10.109
How you doing?

28:11.250 --> 28:12.900
I tried to kill your friend.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.640
Yeah, well, you know, she's used to it.

28:18.450 --> 28:20.869
I think I should go.

28:23.849 --> 28:26.019
Look...

28:26.849 --> 28:30.109
...why don't you just stay here.

28:31.650 --> 28:34.210
I know it doesn't feel like it yet...

28:35.250 --> 28:37.710
...but this could be home for you.

28:41.849 --> 28:44.480
I don't have a home.

28:46.650 --> 28:48.819
That's not true.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.500
You just don't remember, that's all.

28:54.450 --> 28:56.839
Your home is here.

28:58.049 --> 29:00.960
This is where you're
supposed to be, son.

29:02.849 --> 29:05.829
You speak as though you're my father.

29:08.250 --> 29:12.289
- Well--
- He said the same thing.

29:13.049 --> 29:17.400
He said we came back for a reason.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.210
Did he?

29:38.849 --> 29:40.500
Daniel.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.349
I told him you two were gonna
take him out.

29:49.650 --> 29:52.529
- And he's good with that?
- Yeah, he seems to be.

29:54.450 --> 29:56.450
Where do you want us to take him?

29:57.450 --> 29:59.549
Someplace where this world
isn't as ugly as he thinks it is.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.799
- How long you need?
- Couple of hours.

30:05.250 --> 30:08.509
- What if he asks where you're at?
- Don't tell him.

30:10.650 --> 30:12.509
Wait, we have to do that thing.

30:13.650 --> 30:15.369
- What thing?
- That thing we do.

30:15.450 --> 30:18.500
Where I say, "Do you know what you're
doing? Please think about this."

30:19.049 --> 30:20.799
Then you ignore me
and rush into trouble.

30:21.450 --> 30:22.990
Right. That thing.

30:25.049 --> 30:26.839
- We done?
- Please think about this.

30:27.450 --> 30:28.569
Don't go.

30:29.250 --> 30:31.279
- I have to.
- I know, but don't.

30:31.650 --> 30:33.049
I won't kill him, though he deserves it.

30:33.450 --> 30:34.710
I don't care if you kill him.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.369
He stole Connor's childhood,
so kill him.

30:38.849 --> 30:40.809
But don't lie to your son.

30:41.849 --> 30:44.200
He's been here, like, a day.
Way to build the trust.

30:44.250 --> 30:44.950
I'm not lying to him.

30:45.450 --> 30:50.160
You're distracting him while you confront
the man he thinks of as his father.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.950
I'm his father.

30:56.849 --> 30:58.359
Before you, there was nothing,

30:59.849 --> 31:01.460
I was dead.

31:02.250 --> 31:05.579
They had taken my sister.
They had taken a part of me.

31:06.450 --> 31:10.450
You gave me a reason again.
Even if it was all lies.

31:11.849 --> 31:13.180
Not all.

31:15.450 --> 31:17.700
I still think I'd do anything for you.

31:17.849 --> 31:20.339
I'd have followed you into hell
if you would've let me.

31:22.049 --> 31:24.369
Thank God you didn't.

31:26.250 --> 31:29.059
I can't believe you survived it.

31:29.849 --> 31:31.250
How did you?

31:31.650 --> 31:35.930
- My hate kept us alive.
- Hate gets a bad rap.

31:37.650 --> 31:40.039
It can keep you going sometimes
when nothing else will.

31:40.650 --> 31:45.250
Yes. I found that I had to stay alive
that I might pass on my legacy of hate.

31:46.049 --> 31:49.529
But something happened in that place.
Something changed.

31:50.250 --> 31:54.079
Amidst the most unspeakable ugliness...

31:55.049 --> 31:57.650
...the hate turned into love.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.619
Love for a son. Hate's not enough.

32:02.849 --> 32:05.410
I found that love is far more powerful.

32:06.450 --> 32:09.680
Now there's just one thing
I need you to do for me...

32:10.049 --> 32:13.670
...and then I can finally be done
with vengeance.

32:17.849 --> 32:19.289
What is it?

32:20.849 --> 32:23.970
The ocean. Pacific.

32:25.049 --> 32:26.130
Ocean.

32:27.450 --> 32:29.940
My father taught me about oceans.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.240
He never said it was so....

32:32.849 --> 32:34.460
Big?

32:36.450 --> 32:37.569
Empty.

32:38.849 --> 32:42.009
It's not.
It's just all under the surface.

32:43.049 --> 32:44.839
A whole other world, actually.

32:45.450 --> 32:47.869
Everything's so different here.

32:52.049 --> 32:54.509
I know how you feel.

32:55.049 --> 32:58.630
I got lost once, like you.

32:59.250 --> 33:02.200
When I came back,
nothing seemed real.

33:04.049 --> 33:07.309
Like I was seeing everything
from the bottom of the ocean.

33:07.650 --> 33:10.210
I don't remember being lost.

33:13.650 --> 33:14.700
Steven? Yo!

33:16.049 --> 33:18.650
Maybe we should just give him a minute.

33:29.250 --> 33:31.569
- I wish Angel was here.
- Yeah.

33:32.849 --> 33:35.619
His kid's seeing the ocean
for the first time, he's missing it.

33:36.450 --> 33:38.869
That's not what I meant.

33:39.450 --> 33:42.190
I just feel sort of creepy.

33:43.049 --> 33:47.440
- Keeping him distracted while Angel--
- Confronts the kidnapper?

33:47.849 --> 33:50.549
Well, if you're gonna
put it like that....

33:53.849 --> 33:56.200
- What do you think he'll do?
- I don't know.

33:56.849 --> 34:01.559
I know what I'd do, but Angel
will deal with Holtz in his own way.

34:08.250 --> 34:09.230
Uh-oh.

34:09.449 --> 34:10.750
No way.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.599
He couldn't have heard us.

34:16.650 --> 34:18.440
He did.

34:38.050 --> 34:41.000
Angel. Oh, my God, do you know how
happy this makes me?

34:41.650 --> 34:43.719
I asked you not to go,
and you didn't go.

34:44.050 --> 34:46.260
I am so glad to see...

34:47.050 --> 34:48.130
...you.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.190
Hi.

34:59.050 --> 35:01.650
I can't recall...

35:02.050 --> 35:05.769
...would you require an invitation for
a place like this?

35:08.050 --> 35:10.300
Public accommodation.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.989
- No.
- No.

35:16.449 --> 35:20.210
You'd think I'd remember something
like that. It seemed important once.

35:23.650 --> 35:26.769
Details begin to escape me.

35:27.849 --> 35:28.789
You stole my son.

35:29.650 --> 35:34.000
I kept your son alive.
You murdered mine.

35:48.849 --> 35:50.849
I was different then.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.059
Yes. So was I.

35:57.849 --> 35:59.530
You feel remorse.

36:02.050 --> 36:05.380
You feel remorse,
yet you can't express it.

36:06.849 --> 36:08.949
You want me to say I'm sorry?

36:09.250 --> 36:13.920
How can I? It wouldn't mean a thing.

36:15.849 --> 36:20.449
It would mean a little.
Not much, but it would be something.

36:23.650 --> 36:25.260
Then I'm sorry.

36:26.650 --> 36:28.579
For whatever little it might mean.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.039
It's all I've got.

36:35.050 --> 36:39.550
Not all. You had a son.

36:44.650 --> 36:48.130
So there it is.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.570
I thought by depriving you
of that son...

36:53.650 --> 36:58.039
...it would allow me some measure
of justice. I was wrong.

36:59.050 --> 37:03.550
Taking Connor from me was
never justice.

37:05.050 --> 37:09.900
- It was vengeance.
- Or maybe vengeance is what I do now:

37:11.650 --> 37:14.559
- Give back what I took.
- What?

37:15.250 --> 37:20.480
I'm an old man now.
I have nothing to offer the boy.

37:21.250 --> 37:24.550
You can give him what I can't:
his purpose.

37:25.449 --> 37:31.070
But every time you look upon his face,
every time he calls you "Father"...

37:32.650 --> 37:37.500
...you'll be reminded of that which
you took and can never give back.

37:39.849 --> 37:45.050
And if that is vengeance,
I find I have no taste for it.

37:52.449 --> 37:57.090
All I ask is that you give him this.
It's not sealed.

37:58.449 --> 38:00.659
I expect you'll examine it.
You should.

38:00.849 --> 38:02.639
Why are you doing this?

38:04.449 --> 38:08.170
I thought I made that plain.
I love my son.

38:09.250 --> 38:13.250
And it's the only way I know to ensure
he'll go on loving me.

38:31.449 --> 38:34.929
He won't accept this at first.
He'll try to find me.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.400
He never will.

39:07.210 --> 39:11.039
Dearest Steven, This is a most
difficult letter for me to write,

39:12.010 --> 39:15.659
You mean more to me than anything
in this world or any other,

39:16.210 --> 39:18.559
But your best interests
must come first...

39:19.210 --> 39:22.969
... which is why by the time you
receive this, I will be gone,

39:23.409 --> 39:26.360
I hope one day you will be able
to forgive an old man 's weakness...

39:27.610 --> 39:30.210
... which compels him to say
these things in a letter,

39:30.610 --> 39:35.139
But to attempt a goodbye in your
presence would be impossible for me,

39:36.010 --> 39:39.800
I fear I would never let you go,
and I must let you go,

39:40.809 --> 39:44.000
I know that if I didn 't you would
only end up hating me...

39:44.409 --> 39:46.340
...and that I could not bear,

39:46.809 --> 39:48.489
Don't make me do it. I can't.

39:49.210 --> 39:51.840
We already know you can.
You promised.

39:52.210 --> 39:55.019
You said you'd do anything for me.
Come on, Justine.

39:55.809 --> 40:00.550
I'm not asking you to follow me into
hell. Just help send me there.

40:07.809 --> 40:11.809
Your destiny lies with Angel,
I know that now,

40:12.610 --> 40:15.280
You will have a better life with him,

40:21.610 --> 40:24.139
I'm comforted by that certainty
and in the knowledge that with him...

40:24.610 --> 40:26.960
... you'll discover your true purpose...

40:27.610 --> 40:30.519
...and come to know who it is
you are meant to be,

40:39.010 --> 40:40.199
Steven.

40:41.409 --> 40:43.090
Connor.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.929
Dad! Dad?

40:49.210 --> 40:50.960
My only prayer...

40:51.010 --> 40:54.170
...is that I have prepared you
well enough for whatever lies ahead,

40:55.210 --> 41:00.550
I trust I have, Be brave,
lovingly, your father,

41:19.809 --> 41:21.489
Angelus.
