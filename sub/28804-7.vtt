00:18.000 --> 00:19.333
I have an appointment
with Dr. Nolan.

00:19.417 --> 00:21.166
I put this thing together.
Brought it to Evans.

00:21.250 --> 00:22.333
What did you tell Vicky?

00:22.417 --> 00:23.834
He's really gonna go through

00:33.583 --> 00:34.792
You can't be parked here.

00:35.959 --> 00:38.000
I watched you and the two guys
do your thing.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.375
I could have done all 3 of you
and taken off with the truck.

00:40.458 --> 00:43.291

because I'm no use to you dead.

00:50.125 --> 00:51.458

"Grab Bobby. Bring him over."

00:51.709 --> 00:53.500
Did you pick him up
or he picked you up?

00:53.583 --> 00:55.208
Jack. Jack.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.166
Motherfucking asshole.

02:13.041 --> 02:14.709
got tied up with something.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Lost track of time.
Yeah, you know it.

02:20.542 --> 02:23.834
Look, I need you to
cover for me, will you?

02:27.208 --> 02:28.917
Thanks for that. I owe you.

02:29.709 --> 02:30.917
I'll see you tomorrow.

Don't know.

You don't have to do
whatever it is you're doing.

02:57.959 --> 02:59.583
Says who?

03:00.250 --> 03:02.458
You had your fun,
didn't you?

03:02.834 --> 03:04.667
What fun?

03:04.750 --> 03:06.583
You shot Felix,

03:06.667 --> 03:08.375
kidnapped me,

03:08.458 --> 03:11.166
made me cry,
made me feel ashamed.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.250
-I didn't know you then.
-Do you remember what you said?

03:16.417 --> 03:17.583
You said

03:17.667 --> 03:21.250
you would fuck me in
the ass, every hour,

03:21.333 --> 03:23.083
on the hour,

03:23.166 --> 03:25.041
and then
chop me up

03:25.125 --> 03:27.208
and mail my body
parts to Dwight.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.083
I only said that to
scare him. I would never--

03:29.166 --> 03:31.125
You were so
condescending.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.375
"You'll have
an exciting survival story

03:33.458 --> 03:35.208

you to toy with.

And then...

03:43.458 --> 03:45.834
(clicks restraint, drops chain)

03:45.917 --> 03:47.792
You judged me.

03:49.583 --> 03:50.917
"What are you doing?

03:51.208 --> 03:53.959
Messing around behind
your husband's back?"

03:55.000 --> 03:57.709
Like I deserved punishment.

03:57.792 --> 04:00.458
Like I brought this upon myself.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.291
I didn't know you.

04:04.291 --> 04:05.959
And now you do?

04:07.583 --> 04:09.166
Why?

04:10.041 --> 04:13.041
Because you watched me
through my window at night?

(scoff)

04:14.709 --> 04:16.333
Thinking what?

04:17.333 --> 04:19.500
What did you wanna do to me?

04:19.834 --> 04:21.166
Nothing.

04:21.917 --> 04:23.000
Nothing.

04:23.667 --> 04:25.917
I was worried about
you, that's all.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.208
Why would you be
worried about me?

04:28.291 --> 04:30.500
I told you.
I felt responsible.

04:31.792 --> 04:32.959
Oh.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.667
You wanted to save me?

04:36.750 --> 04:38.166
-Well, sure.
-Yeah?

04:38.250 --> 04:40.667
Be my knight in
shining armor?

04:40.750 --> 04:42.458
What's wrong with that?

04:43.208 --> 04:45.375
I'm asking the questions.

04:46.041 --> 04:47.667
This is my show now.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.709
I'm the one who does
things. You're the toy.

04:49.792 --> 04:51.333
You're fucking nuts.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.375
Hmm.

Don't you wish.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.709
What did you think
was gonna happen?

05:02.250 --> 05:05.208
I fall in love with you,
is that what you thought?

05:06.208 --> 05:07.792
Yeah.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.250

14:32.667 --> 14:35.208
two and a half years,
if I'm honest.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.083

14:38.834 --> 14:40.959
Endometriosis.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.792
You know what that is?

14:44.125 --> 14:46.500
No, don't figure you would.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.625
Pretty common in women.

14:49.542 --> 14:52.625
It's a disease where
the tissue that lines the uterus

14:52.709 --> 14:54.917
-grows outside of it.

15:06.792 --> 15:09.834

been too horrible a burden,

is so common,

every five women

15:24.208 --> 15:26.166
who has a pregnancy

15:26.250 --> 15:27.959
ends up in miscarriage.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.291
Nobody ever talks about it.

15:30.834 --> 15:33.000
It's a cause of great shame.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.583

celebrate pregnancy loss.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.625

I'm not here to do
you harm, Wesley.

But, if you can't recognize
a bad situation facing you,

59:51.458 --> 59:53.083

closer, I just might

No.

In a different circumstance
would have much rather left
