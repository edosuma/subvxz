WEBVTT

00:38.582 --> 00:40.499
What's up, Grandpa?
Where you going?

00:41.835 --> 00:44.253
Holy fuck! Who the fuck is that?

00:44.337 --> 00:45.922
-Oh.
-Hey, it's me! It's me, it's me.

00:46.005 --> 00:47.340
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-It's me.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.092
- What?
- You scared the shit out of me.

00:49.175 --> 00:50.969
Sorry, sorry, sorry, all right?
Don't freak out.

00:51.052 --> 00:52.511
I can't stand it when you do that!

00:53.346 --> 00:55.389
Hey, so when is your dad's birthday again?

00:55.473 --> 00:56.975
Uh, November 9th.

00:57.058 --> 01:00.562
Cool, cool, okay.
Yeah, I got a fun gift idea for him.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.397
What? Which one?

01:03.481 --> 01:06.525
Yeah, I'm gonna get him these, like,
Omaha Steaks.

01:06.610 --> 01:08.612
-You know... you know about Omaha Steaks?
-Oh.

01:08.695 --> 01:09.779
Um, yeah.

01:09.863 --> 01:11.990
Yeah. Like, they put 'em in a box...

01:12.073 --> 01:13.449
-Mmm-hmm.
-...they send 'em off,

01:13.532 --> 01:15.577
and then you take 'em out of the box
and throw 'em on a grill.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.245
I'm gonna send your dad, like,
a couple dozen.

01:17.328 --> 01:18.747
-I think he'll like it.
-Cool.

01:18.830 --> 01:19.998
-I'll just--
-Don't touch my feet.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.916
What? Come on, you know you like that
when I touch your feet.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.084
-Come on--
-Don't touch my feet.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.169
I just think, it'd be good.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.213
I need you back.
I need you to take care of me.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.257
And... and I was thinking about us...

01:29.340 --> 01:32.426
and... about my heart
and how I feel about you.

01:32.510 --> 01:35.304
Come on, I know you.
And I love you and you're so hot.

01:35.388 --> 01:37.515
And I just... I need you, Mama.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.518
Fine. Just shut the fuck up!
I'll fuck you, but then you have to go.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.478
-You're not sleeping here tonight.
-Yeah, that's cool.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.356
I was looking at this website...

01:45.439 --> 01:48.234
-Mmm-hmm.
-...and I found this rug.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.028
I thought it would look really good
in your living room.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.655
Oh, yeah.

01:51.738 --> 01:54.365
Yeah, I like that orange one.
It's nice.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.992
I was thinking the blue one.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.202
Sure. Blue works, too.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.079
Yeah, I mean, either/or...

02:00.163 --> 02:02.165
Orange or blue,
whatever one you're standing on,

02:02.248 --> 02:03.541
it's gonna look good.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.584
-Oh.
-Huh? Huh?

02:09.380 --> 02:12.676
I was thinking about that, um...
you know the blue rug.

02:12.759 --> 02:13.843
Uh-huh.

02:15.094 --> 02:17.555
Maybe we don't get it, like,
for my place, but...

02:18.723 --> 02:20.725
Like, what if we got it for, like,
our place?

02:20.809 --> 02:22.476
You wanna move in together?

02:22.560 --> 02:24.646
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.355
-I mean, do you? Do you--
-Yeah.

02:26.439 --> 02:27.816
-You wanna move in?
-Yeah.

02:27.899 --> 02:29.651
--Let's move in together.

02:31.069 --> 02:33.446
-Yes!
-I am God's warrior!

02:33.529 --> 02:35.657
- Yes, you are! Yes, you are!

02:36.950 --> 02:40.286
I'm gonna come.
I'm gonna come.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.414
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.069
Do you remember that little...

03:13.152 --> 03:15.446
The travel-size Connect Four?
Do you remember that game?

03:15.529 --> 03:16.740
What? Why?

03:16.823 --> 03:19.033
I just wanna... I wanna play a game
from my youth, you know?

03:19.117 --> 03:21.828
Nobody has the attention span anymore
to just sit and play a game.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.454
What about Operation?
Remember Operation?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.705
Ah, shit.

03:24.789 --> 03:26.207
Why can't we just sit anymore?

03:26.290 --> 03:27.708
Maybe that's 'cause you're coked up.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.878
That's not it, all right? Okay, let's--

03:29.961 --> 03:31.796
Nobody can just sit
and read a book anymore.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.507
Nobody just sits and reads a book--
All right, you know what? We'll...

03:34.590 --> 03:37.051
Let's both read books,
and we'll see who gets distracted first.

03:37.135 --> 03:38.720
We'll see...
we'll see who's gonna do that.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.429
I'm not gonna read with you, Eric.

03:40.513 --> 03:41.639
All right, this is what we'll do.

03:41.723 --> 03:43.599
I'm gonna read
Crime and Punishment, all right?

03:43.682 --> 03:45.684
And you'll read Cujo, all right?
That's what we'll do.

03:45.769 --> 03:48.354
And we'll see who can read the most pages
without getting distracted.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.398
Ready to do that?
Let's do that, okay?

03:50.481 --> 03:54.903
Cocaine, no cocaine,
my attention will not be challenged.

03:54.986 --> 03:57.113
You got a real drug problem, Eric.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.407
What's that?

03:59.490 --> 04:02.576
Well, these are the drugs
I have to take to deal with you.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.495
All right, ready?
No distractions, all right?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.414
Just read. No distractions. No.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.624
We just get right into it.
We just get...

04:10.709 --> 04:13.254
Just right into it. We're just
gonna get right into it, all right?

04:14.588 --> 04:16.758
- Ow!  Ow, God.
- Ow!

04:16.841 --> 04:19.427
-Fuck... ow.
-Didn't know your knee was there.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.345
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.430
Okay.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.893
Hey, I love you. Okay?

04:26.976 --> 04:28.061
Mmm-hmm.

04:28.144 --> 04:29.312
What's the matter? What's wrong?

04:29.395 --> 04:31.605
You say "I love you" too much.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.151
-Do I?
-Yeah.

04:36.235 --> 04:40.949
Okay. Well, I'm, like,
so sorry to be affectionate to you.

04:41.032 --> 04:43.367
-I guess that's--
-No, it's not affection, it's pressure.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.245
Because then if I don't say it back
then it becomes a thing.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.705
Well, why wouldn't you say it back?

04:47.789 --> 04:49.874
I mean, if it's true
you would say it, right?

04:49.958 --> 04:51.125
'Cause I, like, I love you.

04:51.209 --> 04:52.626
Oh, my God, please stop saying that.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.796
-Okay, well, I do. I love you--
-Okay, stop it!

04:54.879 --> 04:55.880
-I love you.
-Stop it.

04:55.964 --> 04:57.590
-What is the fucking problem?
-Gus, please shut up!

04:57.673 --> 04:59.801
I love you. God damn it!
What is the matter?

04:59.884 --> 05:01.552
--What? Just fucking say it.

05:01.635 --> 05:05.223
I fucked another guy!

05:05.306 --> 05:08.309
Well, you know, just so you know, like...

05:08.392 --> 05:11.645
because we're broken up, that means, like,
we're not talking anymore, you know?

05:11.729 --> 05:14.773
So you can, like, text,
and you can call and, like, email me,

05:14.858 --> 05:17.151
but I'm not, like, gonna reply, okay?

05:17.235 --> 05:20.196
-So, like, once you're out, you're out.
-So we're never gonna talk again?

05:20.279 --> 05:23.407
No, because you fucked another guy, okay?

05:24.200 --> 05:26.035
I can't imagine that...

05:26.119 --> 05:28.872
that you're just gonna be around
and you're not gonna be in my life.

05:28.955 --> 05:30.874
I mean, like...

05:30.957 --> 05:32.750
obviously,
we're still gonna be friends, okay?

05:32.834 --> 05:34.127
- No!
- What the fuck?

05:34.210 --> 05:36.504
This is what I'm fucking talking about!

05:36.587 --> 05:37.630
Well, what am I?

05:37.713 --> 05:39.007
Am I too nice?
Am I too mean?

05:39.090 --> 05:40.549
Yes, you're too fucking--
You're not nice!

05:40.633 --> 05:43.761
You're... you're fucking fake nice,
which is worse than being mean!

05:43.844 --> 05:46.097
You know, it's over.
I get that.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.516
It's fucking over and it's done.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.352
I just want you
to be true to yourself.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.479
Okay, being true to myself?

05:53.562 --> 05:55.814
-Yeah.
-I want you to fucking die.

05:55.899 --> 05:58.985
Okay? I want you to fucking
get a disease and die,

05:59.068 --> 06:01.112
or fucking get in a car accident and die.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.407
That's what I want,
I want you to fucking die.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.036
It's over.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.252
--Oh, shit.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.629
- What? What's wrong?
- We just gotta go quicker.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.423
- Why? What the fuck?

06:20.506 --> 06:22.091
-My mom's here.
-What the fuck?

06:22.175 --> 06:24.010
-Why is your mom here?
-Oh, just go quicker.

06:24.093 --> 06:26.137
-Come with me, come with me.
-No, I can't. I can't just do that.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.389
- You're like--

06:30.683 --> 06:33.894
What the fuck, dude?
That's really lame.

06:33.978 --> 06:35.188
Oh. Well, I just...

06:35.271 --> 06:37.440
I got stuff to do today, you know?
Gettin' it together.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.358
You're really going right now?

06:39.442 --> 06:42.195
What? Yeah. Yeah, she's taking me
to buy pants and I totally forgot.

06:42.278 --> 06:43.279
What the fuck?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.448
-You can't but your own pants?
-She offered.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.992
It's not cute that you live
with your parents, Eric.

06:48.076 --> 06:50.869
You tell people it's some sort of
life hack, but it's just sad.

06:50.954 --> 06:52.663
It's sad to want new pants?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.999
All right, I'm sorry,
I'm a human being, all right?

06:55.083 --> 06:56.709
Eventually, I'm gonna need pants.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.753
Wait, you're going?
You're actually going? Eric!

06:59.837 --> 07:02.340
I don't even know why it's something
you get pissed off about.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.883
-I need new pants. What's wrong with you?
-Eric, fucking, you wait!

07:04.968 --> 07:06.677
Don't get in that car.
You were just fucking me--

07:06.760 --> 07:08.137
Good morning, Mickey.

07:08.221 --> 07:09.347
Hi, Mrs. Todd.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.933
Hey, me and Eric are going
to that new mall in Topanga.

07:12.016 --> 07:13.935
Don't get in the fucking car, dude.

07:14.018 --> 07:16.687
I'm so tired of you acting
like a fucking child.

07:16.770 --> 07:20.191
If you get in that car with your mom,
then you're a fucking loser.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.900
Snore, snore, snore.

07:21.985 --> 07:24.737
You're putting me to sleep, Ma.
You're boring me to death right now, okay?

07:24.820 --> 07:27.865
You think I'm a fucking child?
You think I'm a fucking loser?

07:27.949 --> 07:30.201
Well, bullshit, all right?
You're just as fucked up as me.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.161
The difference is
I have the balls to admit it.

07:32.245 --> 07:33.537
Ma, let's go!

07:33.621 --> 07:35.331
Eric, honey. Honey...

07:35.414 --> 07:37.166
why don't you invite your friend Mickey

07:37.250 --> 07:39.627
and we will go and get the slacks
at the mall together?

07:39.710 --> 07:42.421
He's not my friend.
His cum is still inside of me.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.881
Eric, it's over!

07:43.965 --> 07:46.550
Who even talks to
somebody's mother like that?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.093
I'm open.

08:30.011 --> 08:31.220
- Got you.

08:31.304 --> 08:34.348
Retaining a harem
of over 100 females

08:34.432 --> 08:36.684
will require him to fight
many challengers...

08:38.019 --> 08:39.062
Hey, um... a little help?

08:39.145 --> 08:41.189
Elephant seal pups
in such a hostile environment

08:41.272 --> 08:43.816
can sometimes get caught
in the middle of these riots,

08:43.899 --> 08:45.443
putting them in harm's way.

08:47.820 --> 08:50.781
- Oh... Hey.
- Hey, sorry about that, man.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.076
Oh, sorry?

08:53.159 --> 08:55.911
Who cares, guys? It's fine.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.080
Have fun, you know?

08:57.163 --> 08:59.415
Here you go. Oop, sorry.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.417
Cool.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.669
So you guys are up...  early, huh?

09:03.752 --> 09:04.878
You on spring break or...

09:04.962 --> 09:07.798
-Oh, this is study abroad.
-In Los Angeles, huh?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.883
The college, they put us up
at the Springwood for a semester.

09:09.967 --> 09:14.347
Yeah, since this shithole is basically,
like, one step up from a dorm room.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.224
Yeah, I'm gonna miss all the drug dealers

09:16.307 --> 09:18.767
and child actors
and the sad divorced guys.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.898
Well, I'll let you get back
to your Fris-ing.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.651
Well, hey, man, we're having
a kickback tonight by the pool.

09:27.735 --> 09:28.736
You should drop by.

09:28.819 --> 09:32.156
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
We'll see, we'll see.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.700
So that's the bathroom,
we have to share it.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.286
- Oh, okay.
- My mom gave me that stupid thing.

09:37.370 --> 09:40.456
-It's nice. Uh-huh.
-Um, that's the kitchen.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.458
-Do you cook?
-Uh, a little here and there.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.834
-Baking...
-Huh?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.754
You never really hear
about an Australian style of cuisine.

09:46.837 --> 09:47.921
No, there isn't any.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.590
--Hmm.  No, bad, bad.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.925
-Aw. Who's the kitty?
-Ugh, sorry about that.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.761
Oh, God. Are you allergic to cats?

09:53.844 --> 09:55.471
No, no, no, I love cats.
What's his name?

09:55.554 --> 09:56.722
His name's Grandpa.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.642
I named him that 'cause
he's a reincarnation of my grandpa.

09:59.725 --> 10:02.436
-Cute.
-So what do you think?

10:02.520 --> 10:04.938
Of your, uh... Oh, here?

10:05.022 --> 10:08.526
Yeah. It's good, I like it.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.068
So you wanna move in?

10:10.153 --> 10:12.238
Um... oh, really?

10:12.321 --> 10:14.490
Yeah, I mean, you don't seem crazy

10:14.573 --> 10:17.993
and I don't feel like meeting
with a ton of people. So?

10:18.076 --> 10:19.245
Wow, okay. Great.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.414
Great. I'll text that other girl
and tell her to not to come over.

10:21.497 --> 10:22.831
You snooze, you lose.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.793
Cool. So were you, like,
living with another roommate, or...

10:25.876 --> 10:28.129
I mean, my boyfriend
kind of lived here with me.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.088
It was sort of on and off.
He'd come and go.

10:30.173 --> 10:31.924
He'd mainly live with his parents, but...

10:32.007 --> 10:34.177
then we broke up,
so whatever.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.220
Oh, um, I'm so sorry.

10:36.304 --> 10:39.432
Don't be. I'm so glad we broke up...

10:39.515 --> 10:41.767
I just don't really wanna live alone,
you know?

10:41.850 --> 10:44.061
Well, that's perfect.
We can hang out.

10:44.145 --> 10:45.563
And we will.

10:45.646 --> 10:49.483
I just wanna really clearly establish
the roommate boundaries initially.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.194
Yeah. Yeah.

10:51.277 --> 10:53.529
That actually sounds like
we've got a lot in common.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.991
Well...

10:58.075 --> 11:00.369
get out of my space!

11:00.453 --> 11:02.163
This is gonna be fun.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.114
But, Mother,
why is the wolf following me?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.492
Do not fear him.
He is your protector.

11:39.575 --> 11:42.536
Now that you're becoming a woman,
your powers are growing.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.456
My powers? Am I becoming a witch?

11:45.539 --> 11:46.707
We will know soon enough.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.876
When your body aligns
with the lunar cycle.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.669
Now, command the wolf.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.714
--Sabien, submit.

11:59.512 --> 12:01.096
He's not even looking at me.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.348
Uh, cut!

12:02.431 --> 12:05.017
All right, let's get the wolf to sit.
How about that? What's the problem?

12:05.100 --> 12:09.062
Arya, you have to make your hand a fist
or the wolf won't sit.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.188
I was.

12:10.273 --> 12:12.190
No, actually, you were just
holding your hand up.

12:12.275 --> 12:13.442
Are you blind or something?

12:13.526 --> 12:16.362
I was doing exactly what you said to.
The dog's just stupid.

12:16.445 --> 12:19.031
God, just check the playback,
I was doing it.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.866
Arya, superstar, what up?

12:20.949 --> 12:22.285
I'm so tired!

12:24.495 --> 12:26.079
-Evan.
-Hey, what's up, man?

12:26.163 --> 12:27.998
Hey, man. What's going on?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.208
Not much.
What do you need?

12:30.293 --> 12:32.461
-Tutor time.
-Seriously? You're doing this now?

12:32.545 --> 12:35.381
Dude, have you been paying attention?
We lose the wolf in half an hour.

12:35.464 --> 12:37.425
No, I get it. I just... you know...

12:37.508 --> 12:39.427
Arya needs her three hours of class...

12:39.510 --> 12:40.636
-every day.
-Right.

12:40.719 --> 12:43.556
I'm dealing with a child actor
and a live animal here.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.098
I-- I just need you to be a team player.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.892
I know. But I feel like it's always

12:46.975 --> 12:49.395
animals that are coming in and push,
you know...

12:49.478 --> 12:50.771
One day it's snakes,
the next day it's--

12:50.854 --> 12:53.065
Dude, have you ever worked
on a supernatural period piece before?

12:53.148 --> 12:56.569
Come on, man. Everyday there's
a serpent or there's a mule.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.321
I'm looking out for Arya here, okay?

12:58.404 --> 13:01.532
I don't know what to tell you, man.
They're witches, they deal with animals.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.284
Evan, she needs three hours
of class every day, okay?

13:04.368 --> 13:05.369
So we're doing this.

13:05.453 --> 13:07.371
Seriously?
That's the tone you're gonna take?

13:07.455 --> 13:09.289
Yeah, come on, man.
It's the law.

13:09.373 --> 13:10.791
-It's called working--
-What's going on?

13:10.874 --> 13:13.251
-Is there an issue?
-Susan, hey.

13:13.336 --> 13:14.962
Uh, no issues.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.422
Lovin' the scene, it's so good.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.466
Guys, this wolf is almost out the door.

13:18.549 --> 13:19.842
- Can we handle this some other time?
- Yes.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.009
Right, but it's just--

13:21.093 --> 13:22.135
If Arya's not in class

13:22.219 --> 13:23.929
and somebody reports this,
we could lose our jobs and--

13:24.012 --> 13:25.556
Dude, you are the only one
that cares about--

13:25.639 --> 13:26.765
But we could.
We could lose our jobs!

13:26.849 --> 13:28.934
Hey, hey, hey.
Why are we going crazy here?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.019
Gus, listen.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.731
I respect your passion
and commitment here.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.608
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You know?

13:35.691 --> 13:37.192
Yeah, and, you know,
and if the wolf goes away

13:37.275 --> 13:39.277
before we get this shot,
you know, that's... that's fine.

13:39.362 --> 13:40.904
You know, we'll... we'll work it out.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.115
That means so much.
I appreciate that. Thank you.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.992
What would that mean, Evan?

13:45.075 --> 13:47.119
I'm guessing we just have to
come in on Saturday to finish?

13:47.202 --> 13:48.203
Uh-huh. Yeah.

13:48.286 --> 13:49.788
Yeah, just come in over the weekend.

13:49.872 --> 13:50.873
-Yep. Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.875
The crew will probably not like that much.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.543
Oh, they're gonna be pissed.

13:54.627 --> 13:55.878
I mean, I guess
you don't give a fuck about

13:55.961 --> 13:58.171
people spending time with their kids.
Oh, wait, you don't have kids.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.339
- That's for sure.
- Uh...

13:59.423 --> 14:02.426
I feel like we're wasting time
by arguing about it, so...

14:02.510 --> 14:03.802
Let's just do it.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.638
- Really? Excellent.
- We'll do it. Mmm-hmm.

14:05.721 --> 14:06.722
You're my soldier.

14:06.805 --> 14:09.016
All right, we got another take,
everybody. Second take.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.560
Uh, why does everyone else get a CGI wolf?

14:11.644 --> 14:13.186
Why the fuck do we have a real wolf here?

14:13.270 --> 14:15.773
Arya, hey. False alarm.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.776
It's gonna be about 50 more minutes.
And then, we'll take it to class.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.110
I can't. I need a nap.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.904
Nope. No naps today.

14:22.738 --> 14:25.032
-I've been here since 6:00.
-I know that.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.700
But how you gonna count
all that money you got if,

14:26.784 --> 14:28.452
uh, you don't know math, right?

14:28.536 --> 14:31.414
Um, Jeff, the accountant?

14:31.497 --> 14:32.748
Right, Jeff.

14:32.831 --> 14:35.418
He's an Orthodox Jew,
I think he knows what he's doing.

14:35.501 --> 14:36.710
Oh.

14:46.387 --> 14:49.973
Our next caller
is Jason from Chicago.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.018
Jason, how we doin'?
How's our day going?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.728
Well, my mom passed away.

14:54.812 --> 14:56.689
Oh. My condolences.

14:56.772 --> 14:59.191
I have to say,
I'm not too torn up about it,

14:59.274 --> 15:01.902
and actually, that's
what's kind of got me upset.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.862
The fact that I'm not upset.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.989
We can't control how we feel.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.534
And sometimes...

15:08.617 --> 15:12.245
these archetypical people in our lives,
they hurt us.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.373
And they don't fulfill the archetype.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.585
What... what's an archetype?

15:17.668 --> 15:19.628
An archetype is a...

15:19.712 --> 15:22.423
Well, I don't really have
the exact definition.

15:22.506 --> 15:25.718
I do know what it means, obviously,
because I just used it. Um...

15:27.553 --> 15:29.513
Well, thank you so much for calling.

15:29.597 --> 15:30.723
I am Dr. Greg Coulter

15:30.806 --> 15:34.017
and you are listening
to the Love and Living Channel

15:34.101 --> 15:36.061
on Gravity Satellite Radio.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.772
You listen, we hear.

15:40.483 --> 15:42.067
Great. Great show, Greg.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.444
Oh, thanks so much, Rob.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.028
-I really appreciate it.
-So good.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.822
-Good morning, Mickey.
-Hey, you said you wanted to talk?

15:46.905 --> 15:47.906
Yeah.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.868
We need to fire Rob. Rob's gotta go.
Does that make me evil?

15:50.951 --> 15:53.036
No! Please. This is a business.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.913
You know what?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.790
Can you fire him for me... huh?

15:56.874 --> 15:59.001
- Or do program managers not do that?

15:59.084 --> 16:00.919
What? I mean, okay,
you know what? I'll do it.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.505
If you do it, Rob will think I'm a coward.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.089
Yeah, I think that's probably
the right move.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.633
No, wait, you know what?
You do it.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.175
I'm sorry, I'll stop being annoying.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.220
So what's the problem?
What did he do?

16:10.303 --> 16:13.724
Look... Rob does a great job...

16:13.807 --> 16:15.643
but the guy creeps me out.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.895
He's got this look in his eyes.
You ever meet a person

16:17.978 --> 16:19.730
and they smile, and you feel like
they're screaming at you?

16:19.813 --> 16:21.064
What? Rob?

16:21.148 --> 16:23.108
Rob's like the nicest guy
in the whole world.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.693
He's nicer than both of us.

16:24.777 --> 16:29.114
Well, he's just got this bad energy,
this aura around him.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.575
Has he ever done anything to you?

16:31.659 --> 16:33.536
He asked me do I like him.

16:35.287 --> 16:38.499
That's weird, right?
That's not a thing you ask anybody.

16:38.582 --> 16:41.334
- Let alone in a workplace.

16:41.418 --> 16:45.798
Look... I would fire him
but I can't take that on right now.

16:45.881 --> 16:48.216
This might be a difficult thing
for you to understand

16:48.300 --> 16:50.218
but I am very vulnerable in this job.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.554
I have to be.

16:51.637 --> 16:54.139
I make myself vulnerable to the world.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.017
I can't be vulnerable
around somebody like Rob.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.143
So he's gotta go.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.979
Fine, I'll do it just
to end this conversation.

17:01.564 --> 17:03.106
I'm a pussy, aren't I?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.441
I'm sorry, I'm disgusting.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.860
Okay, you know what? I'll do it.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.779
- Thank you.
- Oh, question.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.240
What is a good band to work out to?
Something new.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.451
I don't know. The Monkees?

17:14.535 --> 17:16.244
That's great.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.288
Thanks, you're the best.
You know what?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.582
You fire Rob.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.877
So how was the move
out of the Springwood?

17:23.961 --> 17:27.923
Uh, you know, it's funny
it didn't end up actually happening.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.967
He finally realizes
that the Springwood rules.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.844
You love it there, right?

17:33.095 --> 17:36.223
No. I mean... not exactly.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.600
You can live anywhere in LA!

17:37.683 --> 17:39.184
Okay, like, where?

17:39.267 --> 17:40.936
I mean...  I've been looking,
but it's just...

17:41.019 --> 17:43.480
I'm having a hard time
finding a place I like.

17:43.564 --> 17:45.357
You can move near me.
The Eastside.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.569
I don't know.
It's just a little too cool. And now...

17:48.652 --> 17:51.739
I'd be like the Beverly Hills guy with,
like, a white Corvette.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.993
I mean,
is that what we're doing?

17:56.076 --> 17:58.871
We're just playing
what we'd wanna be?

17:58.954 --> 18:01.707
I don't think it's, like,
what I want to be. It's, like, who I am.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.083
Like, who am I?

18:03.166 --> 18:05.377
I mean, like, where do guys
like me live, you know?

18:05.460 --> 18:08.714
Where do the, like,
repressed hostile nerds

18:08.797 --> 18:12.926
whose girlfriend's accuse them
of being "fake nice" live?

18:13.010 --> 18:14.970
-Santa Monica?
-No.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.347
As long as I stay in the Springwood,
you know...

18:17.430 --> 18:21.476
maybe I get a text from Natalie saying,
"Let's try it again."

18:21.559 --> 18:24.521
And I can just bop out of the Springwood
back to another place

18:24.605 --> 18:28.566
instead of like, bop Springwood,
bop new place, bop Natalie.

18:28.651 --> 18:29.902
It's crazy, right?

18:29.985 --> 18:33.113
Please don't tell me you think you
and Natalie are gonna get back together.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.866
-'Cause that's never gonna happen.
-Yeah.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.576
You're saying it... like, it's over?

18:38.661 --> 18:40.704
She cheated on you.
Why would you wanna be with her?

18:40.788 --> 18:42.414
Gus, she sucked, man.

18:42.497 --> 18:45.125
Fuck Natalie.
And fuck the Springwood.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.501
I think you'll find someone better.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.586
You know,
I know you'll find someone better

18:48.671 --> 18:50.631
and if you have trouble,
I can set you up.

18:50.714 --> 18:52.049
She wasn't right for you, dude.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.383
I think I gotta go.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.969
Gus. Wait. We gotta...

18:56.887 --> 18:58.096
We gotta pay.

18:59.973 --> 19:04.269
Otis, put the dirt down now!

19:04.352 --> 19:05.478
I suppose it's better than Heather's kid.

19:05.562 --> 19:06.814
- She eats dog shit.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.691
I'm serious.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.861
Oh, my God, this day is dragging.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.823
You know what
my favorite part of the day is?

19:15.906 --> 19:17.615
Taking my Ambien.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.492
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.619
There's this moment
right after it kicks in,

19:21.704 --> 19:25.082
and I'm still awake
and everything is perfect.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.710
Seriously, I look forward
to 9:30 every day.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.670
I don't like that shit.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.880
I always wake up having made spaghetti.

19:31.964 --> 19:35.050
Spaghetti is the best.
What's wrong with that?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.259
You want some Ambien?

19:36.343 --> 19:37.678
No, thanks.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.096
Are you sober?

19:39.179 --> 19:40.305
Kinda.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.307
I get it.

19:43.851 --> 19:45.853
Fuck it! Give me some Ambien.

19:45.936 --> 19:47.980
Give me a whole handful.

19:48.063 --> 19:50.190
All right.

19:53.902 --> 19:56.154
I'm sure you have your own methods...

19:56.238 --> 19:57.990
but I turn off all electronic devices.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.868
The last time I took an Ambien,
I emailed my high school principal

20:00.951 --> 20:03.078
to tell him what a great job he had done.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.998
That's why
you're my favorite neighbor.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.542
Otis, enough with the dirt.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.669
You have reached your quota.

20:11.754 --> 20:13.088
Down.

20:21.805 --> 20:24.182
You know, I guess she used to be
an extra on The Little Rascals.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.308
For real?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.019
- Yeah, no, she told me that.
- Jeez.

20:27.102 --> 20:28.103
-Hey, what's going on?
-Hey.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.187
What's happening here?

20:29.271 --> 20:31.857
This old lady in E-2021 died.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.359
I guess she fell in the shower

20:34.442 --> 20:37.695
and the water kept running
on her body for, like, a week,

20:37.780 --> 20:41.408
so when they found her,
the bathtub was full of mush.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.118
Jesus!  What... What?

20:43.201 --> 20:45.078
I told you not to give details.

20:45.162 --> 20:47.915
Yeah, well, you're the one
who gave me the details.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.958
She lived here for 42 years, man.

20:50.042 --> 20:52.127
- Wow.
- Yeah.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.421
How long have you guys lived here?

20:54.504 --> 20:55.923
Eighteen years.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.299
They're roommates but they're not gay.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.717
Yeah, Chris, I don't care. That's fine.

20:59.802 --> 21:00.928
Why, did you think we were gay?

21:01.011 --> 21:04.181
We're best friends.
This is my BFF. We're roomies.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.850
Yeah, no, he said... I didn't.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.894
I don't even care. It's fine.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.438
Nice to meet you.

21:11.521 --> 21:12.981
-Yep.
-Take it easy.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.191
Later, dudes.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.527
Hey, we're not gonna wind up
like those two guys, are we?

21:17.610 --> 21:18.695
I hope so.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.655
We should be so fucking lucky.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.199
Thirty years of friendship?

21:22.282 --> 21:24.159
We should be so fucking lucky, Gus.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.381
Fuck it.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.784
Shit.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.857
You know what I love about Uber?

22:37.941 --> 22:39.401
You don't have to tip.

22:39.484 --> 22:42.070
Fuck taxis, man.
Uber's changing the world.

22:42.154 --> 22:44.156
And you own this car, right?

22:44.239 --> 22:45.532
It's, like, a nice car.

22:45.615 --> 22:46.992
- Yes, ma'am.

22:48.285 --> 22:50.620
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck! Shit!

22:53.331 --> 22:55.167
Hello, this is Rob.

22:55.250 --> 22:59.212
Hi, this is Mickey Dobbs,
the program manager from work.

22:59.296 --> 23:01.839
Uh, anyway, you know that.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.633
Um, I didn't...

23:03.716 --> 23:06.428
Uh, I don't wanna do this
over voicemail, but, um...

23:07.470 --> 23:09.181
Hello?

23:09.264 --> 23:11.766
Hello? Is this...

23:11.849 --> 23:13.851
is this one of those
trick voicemail things?

23:13.936 --> 23:14.937
Mickey, is that you?

23:15.020 --> 23:19.024
God! Sorry! Your voice doesn't normally
sound so message-y.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.483
No, it's me.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.485
We're gonna put Frozen on
in one second, honey, I promise.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.112
Is everything okay?

23:24.196 --> 23:27.950
Um... I don't know how to say this, uh...

23:28.033 --> 23:30.077
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna come right out

23:30.160 --> 23:32.454
and say it to you,
'cause I respect you, okay, Rob?

23:32.537 --> 23:36.041
You are fired from, you know, work.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.460
What?

23:38.543 --> 23:40.462
Greg told you to fire me?

23:40.545 --> 23:42.755
Yeah. Aw.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.882
But... it's nothing personal.

23:44.967 --> 23:46.301
Sure, it's not personal.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.761
You're just Dr. Greg's little henchman,
that's all.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.806
Oh, come on, man.
Aren't we all henchmen?

23:51.889 --> 23:54.726
"Aren't we all henchmen?"
What the fuck does that mean?

23:54.809 --> 23:56.394
Are you high right now?

23:56.478 --> 23:58.480
Are you on drugs?

23:58.563 --> 24:00.607
- Drugs?

24:00.690 --> 24:04.361
Oh, so you're firing me over the phone
while you drive on drugs?

24:04.444 --> 24:05.778
That's great.
Why don't you show my daughter that?

24:05.862 --> 24:07.822
Tell my six-year-old daughter that.
Go ahead.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.366
Hey, look, I drew a big star.

24:09.449 --> 24:12.702
Oh, she drew a big star...
you fucking cock-whore!

24:12.785 --> 24:15.747
Whoa, dude, uncalled for! Shit!

24:49.697 --> 24:50.740
Mickey.

24:55.078 --> 24:57.580
-What the fuck are you wearing?
-Aw.

24:58.581 --> 25:00.333
I'm glad you made it.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.505
This is a really weird bar.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.799
It's not a bar.
You haven't heard of Bliss House?

25:07.882 --> 25:09.717
No. What is this, like, a...

25:11.219 --> 25:13.221
like, a club for old people?

25:13.305 --> 25:15.515
It's a church.
Well, they say it's...

25:15.598 --> 25:17.475
like a church for all churches, you know.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.603
It's more about oneness and togetherness,
not so much a higher being.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.231
But I'm... I'm trying to say
I'm sorry, all right?

25:23.315 --> 25:27.194
This is... this is how I'm trying to say
I'm sorry to you.

25:28.278 --> 25:29.612
The midnight service is the best one.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.114
-You're gonna love it.
-Fuck, no.

25:31.198 --> 25:33.408
Dude, no, no, I can't do that.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.952
I'm wearing, like,
a one-piece under jeans.

26:00.810 --> 26:03.938
Hey! Our buddy from the balcony!

26:04.021 --> 26:07.650
Hey, what's up? You guys!
All right. There you are.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.528
You dropped by.
You even brought your work backpack.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.155
I'm Gus, by the way.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.448
-I'm Nate. Good to meet you.
-Hello. Hi.

26:13.531 --> 26:16.201
-Hey, I'm Hailey.
-Did you get a drink yet, man?

26:16.284 --> 26:18.161
Uh, you know what?

26:18.245 --> 26:20.455
Yeah. Give me a beer.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.499
- Give you a--
- Yeah, give me a beer. Cool.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.667
Yeah, all right. Okay.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.919
- Beer.
- Thank you. Thanks.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.463
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

26:33.301 --> 26:35.637
Good evening,
blessed specimens of this lifetime.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.555
How are you all feeling?
I wanna hear you.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.726
Tonight, we stand together

26:41.809 --> 26:44.604
in a vibratory field
of an advancing potential,

26:44.687 --> 26:47.274
the foundation of which is love.

26:47.357 --> 26:50.860
Love doesn't just happen,
we have to choose it.

26:50.943 --> 26:55.240
We are in a phase of evolution
where we have to agree with love.

26:55.323 --> 26:59.327
We are in a phase of evolution
where we have to embrace love.

26:59.411 --> 27:05.292
We have to see love, feel love,
touch love, heal love.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.752
From the very core of our inner sanction.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.587
Right? You guys know
what I'm talking about.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.756
- Come on, let me hear you.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.842
Holy fuck.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.434
You guys are doing it right.
Seriously.

27:22.517 --> 27:25.520
All of you guys, this is, like,
what your twenties should be about.

27:25.603 --> 27:27.730
Having fun, going wild.

27:27.814 --> 27:31.984
Ever since I was a little kid,
I've been acting like a grown-up.

27:32.819 --> 27:36.198
And now, it's like,
I'm in my thirties,

27:36.281 --> 27:38.157
and I'm, like...

27:38.241 --> 27:39.659
"Oh, my God!"

27:40.785 --> 27:42.245
I need to make up for lost time.

27:42.329 --> 27:44.622
Hey, let's get fucking crazy tonight!

27:46.374 --> 27:49.211
Will you shut the fuck up?

27:49.294 --> 27:51.713
This is a family community.

27:51.796 --> 27:55.800
Families live here.
This isn't fucking Club Med!

27:55.883 --> 27:58.261
Hey! Uh, why don't you just, uh,

27:58.345 --> 28:03.850
let us enjoy this
one special moment in our lives...

28:03.933 --> 28:08.480
before we, you know,
fucking slip in a shower and turn to mush?

28:08.563 --> 28:10.482
Go fuck yourself, man!

28:12.609 --> 28:14.694
- I love you guys!

28:14.777 --> 28:17.029
I love this place!

28:59.196 --> 29:00.823
Guys, thank you so much.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.284
So fun. Really--

29:02.367 --> 29:03.826
- You're the man, Gus.
- You guys are...

29:03.910 --> 29:06.203
-All right, we'll see you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

29:06.288 --> 29:07.872
Hey, what are you doing now?

29:07.955 --> 29:13.127
Me? Um, sawing some logs.

29:14.671 --> 29:16.714
What... What does... What does that mean?

29:16.798 --> 29:17.799
I don't know what that means.

29:17.882 --> 29:20.677
It means sleeping.
It's like an old expression for sleeping.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.220
- Oh.
- Well, uh--

29:23.305 --> 29:26.641
We still have a couple of hours to kill.
Do you wanna hang out at your place?

29:26.724 --> 29:30.186
Uh...

29:30.270 --> 29:34.023
Yeah. Well, okay.
It's a little messy, if that's cool.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.275
Oh, God, it's fine.

29:35.983 --> 29:39.236
Oh, my God! Your bedroom is
literally identical to ours.

29:39.321 --> 29:41.238
- No way. Really?
- Yeah. It's so lame, right?

29:41.323 --> 29:42.574
Hey, look at these candles!

29:42.657 --> 29:44.284
- They've never even been lit.
- So lame.

29:44.367 --> 29:46.328
It's crazy they have
all the same stuff in every...

29:46.411 --> 29:47.787
-Yeah.
-I know.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.706
-It's nuts.
-It's, uh... They're like clones.

29:49.789 --> 29:50.957
- They're clones of each other.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.208
- Clones.

29:52.292 --> 29:53.418
I'm gonna miss it though.

29:53.501 --> 29:55.503
It sucks that we have
to leave and fly back.

29:55.587 --> 29:57.589
- Uh...
- We wanna move to LA after college.

29:57.672 --> 29:58.715
-Ooh.
-Oh, really?

29:58.798 --> 30:00.007
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's cool.

30:00.091 --> 30:02.552
Yeah, 'cause we never did anything fun
while we were here.

30:02.635 --> 30:05.262
We had all these, like, wild, crazy plans.

30:05.347 --> 30:08.182
--Oh, really? Like what?

30:08.265 --> 30:10.810
You guys wanted to go to Six Flags
or something, right?

30:10.893 --> 30:12.019
- No.

30:12.103 --> 30:14.939
No, like, um...

30:15.022 --> 30:17.149
I don't know, uh...

30:17.233 --> 30:19.569
- Never mind.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.695
Uh...

30:20.778 --> 30:23.490
-You guys are--
-We, uh...

30:23.573 --> 30:25.116
We... we kinda...

30:26.200 --> 30:28.285
--We wanted to have a three-way.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.498
Oh. Oh, okay.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.334
Yeah.

30:36.919 --> 30:38.505
- Yeah.  Uh, have--
- Yeah.

30:38.588 --> 30:40.673
Have you ever had one?

30:41.591 --> 30:44.301
Uh, no.

30:44.386 --> 30:47.013
-Mmm. Okay.
-I... I don't think I have. No.

30:47.096 --> 30:49.015
- No, haven't had a three-way.

30:49.098 --> 30:52.309
Well, um, I know Reese hasn't...

30:52.394 --> 30:54.937
- No? Right.
- ...and I haven't, and, uh...

30:55.021 --> 30:57.857
-And I-- Yeah, I haven't. Yeah. no.
-And... you haven't.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.359
So, yeah.

30:59.442 --> 31:02.404
Um, so, is... is it happening?

31:02.487 --> 31:05.281
Now, is this it?
This is the three-way? Yeah?

31:05.365 --> 31:06.574
-Yes, Gus.
-Okay.

31:06.658 --> 31:08.242
I think that was clear.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.452
Cool.

31:09.536 --> 31:13.623
Children, please, step inside
our vibratory field of energy and love

31:13.706 --> 31:15.625
and receive our message.

31:15.708 --> 31:20.171
Remember, if you ask the world for love,
you will receive love.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.466
All of tonight's newcomers, please rise.

31:25.134 --> 31:27.136
Come on. I know--
I know you're digging this.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.389
All right, fuck it.

31:31.433 --> 31:34.101
We speak from our eyes and say,
welcome home.

31:34.185 --> 31:35.352
"Welcome home."

31:35.437 --> 31:37.647
- We love you.
- "We love you."

31:37.730 --> 31:39.649
We walk in your hearts,
and embrace your soul.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.276
"We walk in your hearts,
and embrace your soul."

31:42.359 --> 31:43.986
Please, welcome our newcomers.

31:47.490 --> 31:49.409
This brings our service to an end.

31:49.492 --> 31:52.745
If you didn't get a chance to donate,
the tithing baskets are up front.

31:52.829 --> 31:54.706
Can I ask something?

31:56.749 --> 31:57.792
Yes.

31:59.376 --> 32:02.464
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

32:02.547 --> 32:03.756
Speak what's in your heart.

32:03.840 --> 32:09.345
Hi, guys. Sorry,
I'm on Ambien, so it's, um...

32:10.513 --> 32:14.684
You said earlier that if you ask for love,
the world will send you love back.

32:14.767 --> 32:17.353
But I've been asking and asking,

32:17.437 --> 32:19.564
and I haven't gotten fucking anything.

32:20.607 --> 32:24.068
Hoping and waiting and wishing
and wanting love...

32:25.069 --> 32:28.906
Hoping... hoping for love
has fucking ruined my life.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.453
And you're right, Eric. I am a fuck-up.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.163
I'm really sorry.

32:36.247 --> 32:37.915
But I refuse to believe

32:37.999 --> 32:40.710
that all those dipshits
I went to high school with,

32:40.793 --> 32:43.963
who are married now and putting pictures
on Facebook every day

32:44.046 --> 32:48.050
of their kids in little headbands
have it all figured out, right?

32:48.134 --> 32:50.136
That's gotta be bullshit.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.931
That can't be the deal.
That can't be it.

33:03.900 --> 33:07.820
I know it's, like, not appropriate to be
standing up here in a bathing suit...

33:07.904 --> 33:09.614
but I took an Ambien tonight.

33:09.697 --> 33:12.742
I... I was supposed to go to sleep,
but then he called me to come here.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.451
-I'm really sorry.
-Okay... okay.

33:14.536 --> 33:16.579
- So sorry.
- It's okay. Thank you.

33:29.759 --> 33:30.802
So many of you.

33:34.681 --> 33:36.808
- Mmm.

33:42.146 --> 33:44.231
I'm sorry, I'm just having so much, uh...

33:44.315 --> 33:46.609
- Yes.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.612
Uh... ah, okay.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.323
Oh. Whoa.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.461
Uh, hey, um, hang on...

34:05.545 --> 34:07.630
I'm gonna put on a condom, all right?

34:07.714 --> 34:10.174
I'm... I'm gonna put on a condom
real quick, okay?

34:10.257 --> 34:12.468
- Excuse me. Sorry, pardon me.
- Okay.

34:14.220 --> 34:18.390
So, uh, you know, you two can, uh,
kiss each other if you want, you know.

34:18.474 --> 34:20.476
-Nah, that's okay.
-No. We don't really want to.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.269
- You're sure? Really?
- Yeah.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.438
'Cause otherwise,
it's not really, like, a threesome.

34:24.521 --> 34:28.109
It's more like, you know,
two adjacent twosomes or...

34:28.192 --> 34:29.318
-Nah. It's not our thing.
-No?

34:29.401 --> 34:32.780
Oh, I see, it's sort of, like,
um, I'm like the conduit.

34:32.864 --> 34:34.156
We're sisters.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.160
What the fuck? Jesus! Ew!

34:38.244 --> 34:42.915
I mean, I'm sorry, I don't mean, "Ew,"
but just, like, what the fuck? Ew!

34:42.999 --> 34:45.084
Relax. What's wrong?

34:45.167 --> 34:47.587
You know, for most guys
this would be, like, a fantasy.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.297
What, to be, like,
a participant in incest?

34:50.381 --> 34:52.717
Whoa!  Hey.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.343
-This isn't incest, okay?
-No.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.804
We've never kissed.
We haven't even touched each other.

34:56.888 --> 35:00.266
Okay, yeah, but you're, like...
you know, naked in front of each other.

35:00.349 --> 35:03.936
That's, like, in the realm of,
you know, fucking incest.

35:04.020 --> 35:06.731
So, was it incest when we had
baths together as little girls?

35:06.814 --> 35:09.776
No, no, no, no, no.
That is, like, worlds apart! Okay?

35:09.859 --> 35:13.738
Like, I was touching your boob
while I was touching her thigh, okay?

35:13.821 --> 35:15.782
That's, technically, I'm--

35:15.865 --> 35:18.701
I'm in an incestuous relationship
right now, okay?

35:18.785 --> 35:20.536
Don't judge us.

35:20.620 --> 35:23.455
I'm not judging you, okay? It's just...

35:23.539 --> 35:27.376
It's a surprise, and in all fairness...

35:27.459 --> 35:28.836
you two should've told me.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.339
Okay, dude. You know what?
Sorry that we tried to fuck you.

35:32.423 --> 35:35.217
No. I... I didn't mean it--
Uh, it's just...

35:36.302 --> 35:38.345
I mean, maybe, like, one of you stays?

35:38.429 --> 35:40.389
Go fuck yourself.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.808
All right.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.733
Mmm.

37:27.163 --> 37:28.580
That'll be $2.35.

37:35.755 --> 37:38.340
Shit. Fuck, dude, I don't have my wallet.

37:39.216 --> 37:40.426
Can I pay you back later?

37:40.509 --> 37:42.261
No, we don't do that.

37:42.344 --> 37:43.846
Dude, I live, like, two blocks from here.

37:43.930 --> 37:45.472
I'll run home, get money,
come back, pay you.

37:45.556 --> 37:47.850
I'll pay you more than I owe you.
I'll give you a big tip.

37:47.934 --> 37:50.686
No. You just go home,
get your money,

37:50.770 --> 37:52.438
then come back
and get your coffee.

37:52.521 --> 37:55.649
Dude, I fucking need this coffee
right now, please, dude.

37:55.732 --> 37:58.152
I need it to, like, you know,
get shit going.

37:58.235 --> 38:00.737
Please, please, do me a solid.

38:00.822 --> 38:02.198
This isn't a charity.

38:02.281 --> 38:05.242
If you not gonna pay it, just go.
Get out.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.494
What, you're just gonna
let that coffee get cold?

38:07.578 --> 38:09.163
You're just gonna waste
that cup of coffee?

38:09.246 --> 38:11.082
-Yeah.
-That doesn't make any sense.

38:11.165 --> 38:13.918
No, I'm fucking taking this coffee
right now.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.336
No, no, no, no,
you stealing the coffee.

38:16.003 --> 38:18.297
I'm calling the police.
You're on the cameras.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.049
-I'm on the cameras? Big fucking deal.
-Yeah, yeah. It's--

38:20.132 --> 38:22.634
Hi, hello. Fuck you. Fuck you.
I don't care, you have me on the camera.

38:22.718 --> 38:24.386
You know me, dude.
I'm good for it.

38:24.470 --> 38:25.637
I'll come right back.

38:25.721 --> 38:28.850
Hey, you know what?
I got this. It's cool.

38:28.933 --> 38:30.852
Are you sure?

38:30.935 --> 38:33.437
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.231
Okay.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.690
And a pack of cigarettes?

38:37.900 --> 38:39.735
And a pack of smokes.

38:39.819 --> 38:41.070
Parliaments.
