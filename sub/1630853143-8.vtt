WEBVTT

00:20.979 --> 00:24.149
[Lady Whistledown]
The fastest courtship upon record occurred

00:24.232 --> 00:27.569
during the markedly wet season of 1804,

00:27.652 --> 00:31.156
when Miss Mary Leopold secured a betrothal

00:31.239 --> 00:33.450
over a plate
of sugared almonds and licorice

00:33.533 --> 00:36.327
in just four and a half minutes.

00:37.162 --> 00:41.458
Of course, Miss Leopold
and her new husband would leave London

00:41.541 --> 00:43.418
mere hours after their wedding.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.171
Reason unknown.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.341
Of all
that I have imparted to you, dear reader,

00:50.425 --> 00:54.137
there is but one bit of wisdom
you must heed most.

00:55.013 --> 00:59.559
One can never know the truth
of a marriage hiding behind closed doors.

01:01.978 --> 01:05.273
Beware indeed, blushing newlyweds.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.068
You know not the future that awaits.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.360
Will there be hardship…

01:09.444 --> 01:12.363
Don't you touch me. Stay away!
Just leave me alone!

01:12.447 --> 01:14.532
…or indignity?

01:14.616 --> 01:16.743
[King George] Go away! Leave me alone!

01:26.211 --> 01:31.424
Or will one's future see
the rarest accomplishment of all,

01:32.008 --> 01:34.594
a true love match?

01:37.305 --> 01:43.061
As for which of these fates await
the eager matches of the season of 1813,

01:43.144 --> 01:45.021
only two things will tell…

01:45.730 --> 01:46.689
Time,

01:46.773 --> 01:48.108
and, as always,

01:48.691 --> 01:49.984
this author.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.780
You are permitted to smile, Your Graces.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.907
[breathes deeply]

01:57.909 --> 02:00.411
Might you both move a bit closer as well?

02:01.287 --> 02:02.539
[Simon clears throat]

02:04.332 --> 02:05.250
Better.

02:09.587 --> 02:12.841
Once this portrait business is settled,
I shall quit London.

02:12.924 --> 02:13.800
Tonight, perhaps.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.344
And draw new whispers
about the state of our marriage?

02:16.427 --> 02:18.179
I would prefer otherwise.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.515
Now that we know I am not with child,

02:21.474 --> 02:23.726
you should depart London
at the end of the season,

02:23.810 --> 02:26.062
with the rest of the ton, as planned.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.481
-It is but a few more days.
-[Simon] Very well.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.157
And as to the matter
of the Hastings ball on Friday…

02:37.824 --> 02:39.325
might I count on your attendance?

02:39.409 --> 02:42.203
I have little choice in the matter,
seeing as I am one of the hosts.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.080
It shall be your last such commitment.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.208
This time next week,
our ruse will be well and truly over.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.543
Ah… Um…

02:48.626 --> 02:51.421
Apologies, but this is not working.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.675
Perhaps His Grace might place his hand
on the duchess's shoulder,

02:55.758 --> 02:58.219
so that you both can look
as happy as you surely must be.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.016
[Simon grunts]

03:20.658 --> 03:21.492
My word.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.496
The very picture of devotion.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.716
[Daphne breathes deeply]

03:48.770 --> 03:51.147
-Then where did you meet her?
-About town.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.065
At her shop?

03:52.148 --> 03:53.608
Should you not be off somewhere,

03:53.691 --> 03:55.443
getting ready to attend
your very first ball?

03:55.526 --> 03:56.861
[grunts irritably]

03:56.945 --> 04:00.573
Brother, might I be able to join in
on the fun this summer at Aubrey Hall?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.118
Brother!

04:05.078 --> 04:06.871
Provided you stay clear
of my lucky mallet,

04:06.955 --> 04:07.997
I think it a fine idea.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.959
-You cannot be in earnest.
-I shall begin practicing straightaway!

04:11.459 --> 04:14.003
What other places might Madame Delacroix
frequent besides her shop?

04:14.087 --> 04:16.756
Many places, Eloise,
for her many interests.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.050
You mean her many secrets.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.719
You should be careful, Benedict.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.472
Madame Delacroix
may not be who you think she is.

04:24.555 --> 04:27.350
And consorting with her,
well, there may be consequences.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.520
I would have expected this
from anyone but you.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.022
You think just because
Madame Delacroix has a paid occupation,

04:33.106 --> 04:35.275
or because she does not reside
within Grosvenor Square,

04:35.358 --> 04:36.859
she's different. Is that it?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.153
That she is somehow
less deserving of my attention

04:39.237 --> 04:41.572
because she is not whom
polite society deems appropriate?

04:41.656 --> 04:44.534
-That is not what I am saying at all.
-Then what are you saying?

04:49.497 --> 04:51.582
You are right.
I should prepare for our sister's ball.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.500
Perhaps you should.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.210
Aunt Winnie has sent word.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.380
-Francesca will be arriving home tomorrow.
-How exciting!

04:57.463 --> 04:59.507
Perhaps she can tell us
of time spent far from London.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.010
-Fran has missed so much.
-[Violet] Mm. Indeed.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.888
It certainly has been an eventful season,
what with Daphne and the duke,

05:05.972 --> 05:07.056
and then Anthony and…

05:08.683 --> 05:09.851
Yes, well, never mind.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.314
Marina?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.648
[Marina] Pen, come in.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.028
Wh-- What are you doing?
Mama said you must rest.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.571
I am already feeling much improved.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.947
-Marina…
-What?

05:23.031 --> 05:25.700
Penelope, I assure you I am well.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.994
That tea has accomplished
what I needed it to.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.204
And now, with the season over…

05:30.288 --> 05:32.540
[tremulously] …I can finally go home.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.169
-So that means you are no longer--
-With child?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.422
I would have felt something
by now, I am certain.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.381
[Marina sniffles]

05:41.632 --> 05:42.842
You caused quite a flutter.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.346
[quivering inhale]
That was not my intention.

05:47.305 --> 05:51.267
But I am sorry
for everything I have done and said.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.229
You were right about Colin.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.441
He is a good man with a good heart.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.279
You were very good to him.
I am certain one day he will see it.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.952
-[horse driver hails]
-[horse neighs]

06:10.036 --> 06:13.164
That is odd.
We weren't expecting any callers today.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.046
-[ominous music plays]
-[Marina groans]

06:21.839 --> 06:23.925
Marina? Are you quite well?

06:29.013 --> 06:30.390
[patrons chattering]

06:30.473 --> 06:31.891
I have made my decision.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.936
The duke and I
are going our separate ways.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.855
It is for the best, truly.

06:38.981 --> 06:41.442
I know
I do not always say the right things.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.070
And then the things I do say, well…

06:44.529 --> 06:48.991
They are not always what you wish to hear.
I am only able to offer you what I know.

06:49.700 --> 06:53.371
However difficult
forgiving someone may be,

06:53.454 --> 06:55.665
it is necessary to move forward.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.708
That is not up to me, Mama.

06:59.252 --> 07:03.548
The duke is choosing
to nurture some grudge against his father

07:03.631 --> 07:06.717
instead of allowing himself any…
any kind of happiness.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.846
However am I supposed to forgive that?

07:09.929 --> 07:14.308
However are we supposed to move forward
from there?

07:14.392 --> 07:15.685
[Lady Featherington] Your Grace?

07:18.020 --> 07:21.232
I do hope you are finding
everything you need for Friday's ball.

07:21.315 --> 07:25.445
It will certainly be
the event of the season.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.155
Of course, my young ladies

07:27.238 --> 07:31.200
will have to hear about
the wondrous festivities the next day,

07:31.701 --> 07:34.412
seeing how
they did not receive an invitation.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.165
Prudence, in particular,
is in tears about it.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.041
Is she not, Mrs. Varley?

07:39.667 --> 07:42.712
Oh! Uh…
A-- Absolute watering pot, that one.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.756
Perhaps you might explain
to your young ladies, Lady Featherington,

07:45.840 --> 07:48.551
how they ended up
in such an unfortunate situation,

07:48.634 --> 07:50.219
and who exactly put them there.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.181
Or perhaps we can make room.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.685
I certainly would have no problem
extending my invitation,

07:58.186 --> 08:01.355
as I am sure all of us would like
to forgive the errors of the past

08:01.439 --> 08:02.773
and move forward.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.901
Yes, Mama?

08:06.736 --> 08:07.862
If that is what you wish.

08:08.905 --> 08:09.864
How wonderful!

08:09.947 --> 08:11.115
[Daphne chuckles]

08:11.199 --> 08:14.118
Apologies, ma'am, but a carriage
has arrived back at the house.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.287
A Mr. Crane is there.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.249
I beg your pardon,
but did you say "Crane"?

08:21.292 --> 08:23.252
Would that be a Sir George Crane?

08:29.008 --> 08:31.010
Mr. Crane, how delightful
to make your acquaintance.

08:31.093 --> 08:35.264
I had no idea a soldier
such as yourself was coming to town.

08:35.348 --> 08:39.644
And, well, Miss Thompson has not received
any correspondence from you

08:39.727 --> 08:41.604
in quite some time.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.065
Nor would I have expected her to, my lady.

08:44.148 --> 08:44.982
I beg your pardon?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.985
That man is not who you believe him
to be, Lady Featherington.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.364
It is not George,
but his brother, Sir Phillip.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.033
[sucks teeth]

08:54.534 --> 08:56.869
I have come bearing grim news today.

08:58.746 --> 09:02.166
My brother George died on the battlefield…

09:04.919 --> 09:07.338
several weeks ago, and, uh…

09:08.839 --> 09:09.674
Marina?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.260
Marina, please, wait.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.681
He was writing to me…

09:18.224 --> 09:19.100
George…

09:20.893 --> 09:22.270
to tell me he loved me…

09:24.564 --> 09:29.068
to tell me we could run away together
and marry and have our child.

09:32.697 --> 09:36.909
Sir Phillip found this half-written letter
amongst George's belongings after he, um…

09:41.330 --> 09:44.375
If it were not for your recent inquiries,

09:45.084 --> 09:47.336
Sir Phillip never would have known
I was here,

09:48.629 --> 09:50.715
and I never would have known George…

09:52.633 --> 09:53.551
He loved me.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.264
[crying] All this time, he loved me.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.020
[sobbing] I thought him a villain,

10:04.854 --> 10:06.022
but he was not.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.818
[breathes deeply]

10:12.653 --> 10:16.240
He had a perfectly reasonable explanation

10:16.324 --> 10:17.867
for not writing back to me.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.206
And I was wrong.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.137
[Eloise chuckling]

10:39.513 --> 10:40.514
[Genevieve sighs]

10:40.598 --> 10:45.019
Miss Eloise, you should come back
another day when the shop is open.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.396
I had hoped you would make
an exception for me. [chuckles]

10:47.480 --> 10:49.398
I need a dress for my sister's ball.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.069
You already have a dress
for your sister's ball.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.320
I need another one.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.823
A young lady can never have
too many dresses. [forced chuckle]

11:00.826 --> 11:01.744
Oh!

11:02.370 --> 11:03.704
Ooh! Perhaps this one.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.666
It would make me look quite in fashion

11:06.749 --> 11:08.668
in the eyes of the Featheringtons,
I rather think.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.503
Unfortunate young ladies.

11:10.586 --> 11:13.714
They are still quite stung
from Lady Whistledown's recent exposé.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.134
I wish the author would write
something flattering about them!

11:17.718 --> 11:20.388
-Perhaps she will.
-What makes you say that?

11:20.471 --> 11:23.557
Because she knows
what is good for her business,

11:23.641 --> 11:27.436
and angering loyal customers is not good.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.898
No… No, it is not.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.443
Whether those loyal customers
be Featheringtons

11:34.527 --> 11:36.445
or Bridgertons, even…

11:37.655 --> 11:40.282
Lady Whistledown might wish
to examine what she writes about both.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.492
Indeed.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.664
I have heard people say that men,

11:46.747 --> 11:48.666
such as my brother, if you will,

11:48.749 --> 11:51.335
can withstand rumor and gossip,

11:51.419 --> 11:52.253
but…

11:53.170 --> 11:54.380
I am not always so sure.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.552
I know why you are here, Miss Eloise.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.221
You are very smart,

12:02.304 --> 12:04.765
and you care very much
about the people in your life,

12:04.849 --> 12:05.891
as you should.

12:06.642 --> 12:12.565
But you must know I have no intention
of compromising anyone.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.694
[Eloise] That is good.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.155
Because the queen is enraged.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.199
So whoever Whistledown is
should be careful.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.160
I would hate her to be silenced

12:24.243 --> 12:27.747
before she has a chance to change her ways
and make things right.

12:27.830 --> 12:31.667
I believe Whistledown is smart enough
to take care of herself.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.419
Yes.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.212
She certainly is.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.130
[door opens]

12:36.213 --> 12:38.674
Charming chatting with you,
Madame Delacroix.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.760
Thank you.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.473
Lock the door.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.521
[staff chattering busily]

13:26.931 --> 13:28.516
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.311
-Heading to Will's boxing match?
-Mm-hmm.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.190
-Will you be accompanying me?
-No. I have much to do for the ball.

13:36.732 --> 13:37.691
Hmm.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.486
But, of course, you should go
and express your support.

13:43.864 --> 13:44.740
Simon.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.702
What did your father do…

13:49.787 --> 13:52.373
to make you take that vow
in the first place?

13:52.456 --> 13:54.083
We do not need to have this conversation.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.794
Do I not deserve an explanation,
as your wife?

13:56.877 --> 13:58.712
You deserve more than that indeed. I…

14:03.342 --> 14:06.637
You may not understand this now,
but Daphne, you must know

14:06.720 --> 14:08.597
I am doing this for your own good.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.184
-I can decide for myself what is--
-You will be better off without me.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.325
[sighs]

14:34.373 --> 14:36.375
[attendees clamoring]

14:48.387 --> 14:50.806
[bookmaker]
Three-to-one on Iron Fist to win!

14:51.849 --> 14:54.560
Five-to-two in favor of Iron Fist!
You, sir?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.732
Win this fight,
and perhaps we leave this city.

14:59.815 --> 15:03.027
We can take our exhibitions
all over England if we wish.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.112
To continue living fight-to-fight?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.115
We should be planning
for our future, Alice.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.617
I cannot fight forever.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.161
Our circumstance is solely dependent

15:12.244 --> 15:15.331
on how well I can pander and grovel
to the likes of…

15:15.915 --> 15:16.790
them.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.877
Will, what are you saying?

15:20.836 --> 15:21.921
Perhaps I lose.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.800
Perhaps that purse
will be enough to keep us happy.

15:43.692 --> 15:46.570
-Thank you for meeting me.
-Always interested in a good fight.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.073
But why did you want us here?

15:49.573 --> 15:52.242
I want to place a sizable wager
on this match,

15:52.326 --> 15:55.454
and I am told you two
can manage serious transactions.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.165
My money is on The Beast.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.710
[chuckles] With Mondrich heavily favored?

16:01.794 --> 16:05.714
There's only one reason a flash cull lord
would come to us with such a bet.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.677
Anyone who knows you
must know your word is worthless.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.639
You don't need to take my word.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.015
Instead…

16:17.059 --> 16:19.311
you can take the deed to my house.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.730
Should I lose, it's yours.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.441
[suspenseful music playing]

16:51.468 --> 16:53.846
I figured
you'd have been here an hour ago.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.014
Well, I would've been,

16:55.097 --> 16:57.474
but it's not as if you needed me here
to wish you luck.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.559
You ready?

17:01.687 --> 17:02.813
As I shall ever be.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.484
[boxing bell rings]

17:07.568 --> 17:09.862
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
take your seats!

17:09.945 --> 17:11.530
The match is about to begin!

17:11.613 --> 17:13.073
[crowd cheers]

17:14.950 --> 17:19.872
Our credit at the modiste,
it is still rather precarious.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.790
As in, it is nonexistent.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.833
[Featherington sighs]

17:22.916 --> 17:26.003
The young ladies will just have
to wear something they've worn before.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.505
Before? [incredulously]
Mama, I would rather not attend.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.841
Can one even wear a dress worn before?

17:35.012 --> 17:36.847
I beg your pardon, my lady,

17:36.930 --> 17:39.266
but it seems
my business here is not quite finished.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.852
I would very much like
to speak to Miss Thompson.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.605
I have a question for her.

17:45.647 --> 17:46.565
Marry you?

17:48.567 --> 17:49.777
I do not understand.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.780
After my brother
clearly took liberties with your…

17:53.822 --> 17:54.948
virtue…

17:55.991 --> 17:57.910
I would merely be doing my duty.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.206
[gasps] A respectable marriage!

18:02.790 --> 18:03.791
Miss Thompson!

18:04.291 --> 18:05.626
What a fine thing.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.253
Sir Phillip inherited the Crane title.

18:08.337 --> 18:12.257
He has a perfectly adequate estate
to support you

18:12.341 --> 18:15.260
and perhaps your distant cousins too.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.220
I cannot.

18:17.554 --> 18:18.931
I do not know this man.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.974
I do not love this man.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.269
I cannot marry this man.

18:30.150 --> 18:34.655
George cared for you very much,
Miss Thompson, and that will never change,

18:35.155 --> 18:37.282
but he would have wanted you
to be looked after.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.202
He would have wanted you to be supported.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.288
Allow me
to realize my late brother's wishes.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.924
I thank you for your offer, Sir Phillip,

18:54.007 --> 18:56.635
but I believe
you should now take your leave.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.722
Very well.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.309
I wish you all the best, Miss Thompson.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.701
What have you done?

19:21.368 --> 19:26.123
That was a perfectly acceptable proposal.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.750
I am no longer with child,
Lady Featherington,

19:28.834 --> 19:32.796
so it is neither necessary,
nor acceptable, for me to participate

19:32.880 --> 19:36.383
in any more unwanted arrangements
or disingenuous schemes.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.677
[Lady Featherington sighs sharply]

20:16.798 --> 20:18.008
[mouthing silently]

20:33.857 --> 20:35.859
[crowd cheering raucously]

20:42.866 --> 20:43.825
Come on, Will!

20:46.328 --> 20:47.412
Yes!

20:47.996 --> 20:48.830
Hit him!

20:49.873 --> 20:50.832
Knock him out!

20:52.417 --> 20:55.003
-Oh, my word!
-[indistinct clamoring]

20:55.087 --> 20:57.256
[blows landing] 

20:58.131 --> 20:59.424
Make me some money!

21:07.641 --> 21:10.394
[dramatic music playing]

21:10.477 --> 21:12.479
[no audible dialogue]

21:29.746 --> 21:31.164
[dramatic music intensifies]

21:31.248 --> 21:34.001
[both grunting, moaning]

21:49.099 --> 21:50.434
[Anthony moaning]

21:50.517 --> 21:52.644
[Siena gasping]

21:54.396 --> 21:56.940
[both grunting, moaning]

21:58.275 --> 21:59.693
[crowd cheering]

22:02.279 --> 22:03.405
You can do this!

22:08.535 --> 22:10.370
Come on! Come on, The Beast!

22:11.371 --> 22:12.706
[crowd] Oh!

22:15.792 --> 22:16.835
[crowd] Oh!

22:20.422 --> 22:21.882
[grunting]

22:23.425 --> 22:24.468
[quietly] Yeah. Yeah.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.972
[shocked exclamations]

22:29.765 --> 22:31.016
[The Beast yells]

22:31.099 --> 22:32.059
Yes!

22:32.893 --> 22:33.727
Yes!

22:33.810 --> 22:35.020
Get up, Mondrich!

22:37.939 --> 22:38.940
I won!

22:39.483 --> 22:40.817
[shouts] I won!

23:00.253 --> 23:01.213
[woman] Your Grace.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.548
Lady Danbury.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.220
Did you forget we were to come
and help with preparations for your ball?

23:08.303 --> 23:10.180
Your mama is waiting in the parlor.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.973
I shall be there momentarily.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.353
Lady Danbury?

23:18.271 --> 23:19.981
Did you know about these letters…

23:21.942 --> 23:25.987
the ones the duke seems to have written
to his father as a boy?

23:26.071 --> 23:26.905
I did.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.533
And now, apparently, so do you.

23:29.616 --> 23:30.992
I had no idea…

23:31.827 --> 23:34.329
that Simon had trouble speaking
as a child.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.580
How could you have done?

23:35.664 --> 23:38.625
He worked so very hard
to eliminate the difficulty.

23:39.668 --> 23:40.627
He was…

23:42.421 --> 23:43.839
Well, he was so very proud.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.550
It is why he wrote those letters
in the first place.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.718
To keep his father informed
of his progress.

23:48.802 --> 23:49.719
Mm.

23:50.345 --> 23:53.974
The late duke
never even deigned to read them.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.142
How could…

23:55.976 --> 23:57.144
What kind of father--

23:57.227 --> 24:02.482
One that not only expected
but demanded perfection in his son.

24:03.733 --> 24:07.696
And when that was not achieved…

24:08.530 --> 24:09.364
Well…

24:10.323 --> 24:12.409
I shall leave it to you to imagine.

24:14.369 --> 24:17.497
Simon could not be any more different
from a man such as that.

24:17.581 --> 24:18.790
Of course.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.001
We know that to be true, Your Grace.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.420
You helped him…

24:25.213 --> 24:26.381
overcome his…

24:27.340 --> 24:28.258
impediment.

24:28.341 --> 24:31.470
I merely showed him
what he was capable of all along.

24:32.387 --> 24:35.015
And if he needed some encouragement,

24:35.098 --> 24:36.808
a push from time to time,

24:37.434 --> 24:39.895
that was something I was happy to provide.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.481
But at the end of the day,

24:42.564 --> 24:45.650
the duke's triumph was his and his alone.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.403
It had to be.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.161
[excited chatter]

24:58.663 --> 25:00.665
[tense music plays]

25:07.005 --> 25:10.675
It appears I could have used
that luck of yours today, Your Grace.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.635
[Simon] Indeed.

25:12.385 --> 25:15.055
Though you still managed
to put on quite a performance.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.812
If you needed another investor
or more money, Will,

25:22.896 --> 25:24.189
you could have come to me.

25:24.272 --> 25:27.859
I appreciate the offer, friend,
but I do not need your charity.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.487
-What happened to your honor?
-My honor?

25:32.364 --> 25:34.199
Tell me, Your Grace,

25:34.282 --> 25:38.245
what ever could be more honorable
besides taking care of one's family?

25:39.120 --> 25:42.332
-Besides doing what needs to be done?
-Is that what you hope to tell Alice?

25:42.415 --> 25:45.377
You truly believe
she will come to understand your deceit?

25:45.460 --> 25:47.587
Perhaps you should stop worrying
about my marriage,

25:47.671 --> 25:49.839
and instead put your mind to your own.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.800
-That is not what this is about.
-Is it not?

25:51.883 --> 25:53.927
I'd be willing to wager
your wife says differently.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.345
Watch yourself.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.225
You're angry,

26:00.892 --> 26:01.893
but not with me.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.980
So take it somewhere else

26:05.063 --> 26:07.524
and finally do something about it.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.832
What is this?
And more importantly, how did you get it?

26:23.915 --> 26:25.292
I had an inside tip.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.585
What kind of tip?

26:26.668 --> 26:28.128
-The good kind.
-But where did you--

26:28.211 --> 26:30.547
Does it matter?
Portia, our problems are solved.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.257
And this is only half the winnings.

26:33.341 --> 26:36.678
-Where is the other half?
-I used it to pay off my man.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.931
No matter,
because this is more than enough.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.228
Varley?

26:46.771 --> 26:49.024
We're off to the modiste
straight away in the morning.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.610
The young ladies
shall have new dresses after all.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.528
[Lady Featherington laughs]

27:06.750 --> 27:09.085
I thought you enjoyed breakfast
in the morning room.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.004
I wished for different scenery today.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.382
-I can go if you would like.
-No.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.801
You have already begun.

27:45.038 --> 27:45.872
Is something--

27:45.955 --> 27:47.624
I'm going to Bridgerton House
this morning.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.001
Dear Francesca has returned from Bath.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.713
It seems my entire family is gathering.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.716
Would you care to join me?

27:58.927 --> 28:01.304
I must admit, my brothers
will think it odd if you do not.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.433
Yes.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.561
Yes, I shall join you.

28:16.736 --> 28:19.656
[Anthony] I am confident I could last
a few rounds in a boxing ring.

28:19.739 --> 28:22.242
Well, that is certainly
a match I would like to see.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.368
Sister! [gasps]

28:24.119 --> 28:27.706
-Francesca! Welcome home.
-It is so wonderful to see you.

28:28.331 --> 28:29.999
And you, Your Grace.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.294
I thought four brothers enough,
but returning to five is quite nice.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.297
Simon!
When will I be able to visit Clyvedon?

28:36.381 --> 28:38.758
Allow the duke to find a seat
before you trouble him.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.802
You are welcome to visit at any time.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.011
[Hyacinth laughs]

28:42.637 --> 28:45.432
Now, come. Show me
what you've been learning all summer.

28:46.641 --> 28:47.892
I do not share my food.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.353
You are not to do
what you did the other morning ever again.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.771
Do you understand, Eloise?

28:52.272 --> 28:53.773
You mean visiting my new acquaintance?

28:53.857 --> 28:56.609
-She is not your acquaintance.
-I was wrong about her. She is wonderful.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.237
-You have nothing to worry about.
-I wasn't worried about anything.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.280
Not worried about what?

29:02.365 --> 29:03.199
[Benedict] Uh…

29:03.658 --> 29:04.492
I…

29:05.160 --> 29:08.455
I have a friendship
with Genevieve Delacroix…

29:08.538 --> 29:09.789
[breathes deeply]

29:10.790 --> 29:11.624
…the…

29:12.459 --> 29:13.460
modiste.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.052
Good for you, Brother.
You deserve contentment.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.095
We all do.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.681
If the lady contributes to that,
then I'm happy for you.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.350
[Daphne] Sister,
your pianoforte is quite impressive.

29:29.434 --> 29:30.477
Join me, Brother.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.354
-[Violet] Yes, Colin, why not a song?
-[Colin] If I must.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.023
Whatever is in those candies?

30:03.384 --> 30:04.844
I finally found her.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.763
-Lady Whistledown.
-Who is she?

30:06.846 --> 30:08.348
She is Madame Delacroix.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.183
Madame Delacroix is her.

30:10.266 --> 30:12.477
The modiste and Whistledown
are one and the same.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.854
And she is going to print something
in your family's favor.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.064
She told me so.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.733
Well, that certainly
is an impressive feat,

30:18.817 --> 30:19.818
running two businesses.

30:19.901 --> 30:23.446
We should both aspire to be just like her:
Unmarried, earning our own money.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.574
Look, I'm happy you found her, El,

30:26.658 --> 30:28.868
but I do not think
I can ever be like that.

30:29.702 --> 30:31.663
You now have a duchess for a sister.

30:31.746 --> 30:34.207
That makes achieving
the life you wish for all the more easier.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.086
The status of my family, however,
is an entirely different story,

30:38.169 --> 30:40.797
which will not be changing
in the foreseeable future.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.048
[Hyacinth] Yes, Colin!

30:42.131 --> 30:44.717
[Colin]
♪ And let the catch and toast go round ♪

30:44.801 --> 30:47.887
♪ And let the catch, and let the catch ♪

30:47.971 --> 30:51.808
♪ And let the catch and toast go round ♪

30:51.891 --> 30:53.810
[guests clapping, cheering]

30:53.893 --> 30:57.564
And exactly how many horses do you have?
Might I have an extra one?

30:57.647 --> 30:58.815
Your horses are the prettiest.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.608
I believe the duke has heard enough.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.026
Would a pony do?

31:02.110 --> 31:04.445
-[laughs] I could not fathom…
-[Violet] Your Grace!

31:08.950 --> 31:10.702
Now, here's the tricky one.

31:12.787 --> 31:13.746
And…

31:14.747 --> 31:16.332
[Hyacinth, Gregory laugh]

31:16.416 --> 31:18.877
You do realize it is only made of paper?

31:19.711 --> 31:20.587
Is it?

31:21.045 --> 31:22.922
-[imitates horse nickering]
-[Gregory laughs]

31:23.006 --> 31:24.799
[Simon imitates horse trotting]

31:24.883 --> 31:25.967
[Hyacinth laughs]

31:27.260 --> 31:31.014
[Lady Featherington gasps]
Oh! Astonishing, Madame Delacroix!

31:31.097 --> 31:34.058
Because you were able
to pay in advance this time,

31:34.142 --> 31:38.229
and since I happened to have
some fabrics no one else seemed to want…

31:38.855 --> 31:42.233
There are two others just like it,
Lady Featherington.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.611
Mine will have to be taken in, of course.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.070
Mine's perfect.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.280
And mine is yellow.

31:47.363 --> 31:51.034
You see, young ladies,
everything works out in the end.

31:51.117 --> 31:55.830
And Philipa, perhaps Mr. Finch
might even reconsider his proposal,

31:55.914 --> 31:58.291
now that, um, you have your dowry again.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.126
-Again?
-Yes.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.503
Well, did I lose it somewhere
the first time?

32:02.587 --> 32:04.589
[chattering, laughter continue]

32:14.474 --> 32:16.392
[footsteps approach]

32:17.852 --> 32:18.686
Miss Thompson?

32:20.146 --> 32:20.980
What is it?

32:22.231 --> 32:23.691
[gasping]

32:23.775 --> 32:25.193
I believe I need a doctor.

32:26.402 --> 32:28.988
[Lady Whistledown]
The final ball of any season

32:29.072 --> 32:31.532
is distinguished by one of two things,

32:31.616 --> 32:32.784
anticipation…

32:33.368 --> 32:34.619
or dread.

33:03.189 --> 33:07.026
For, while those who have been successful
in the year's marriage market

33:07.110 --> 33:11.656
look forward to flaunting
their perfect, joyous unions…

33:13.282 --> 33:18.579
others shudder at the thought
of spending one last night

33:19.163 --> 33:22.208
before the discerning eyes of the ton.

33:23.543 --> 33:27.964
As they know, indeed,
just what the evening signifies,

33:28.881 --> 33:32.802
that their time is officially up.

33:34.303 --> 33:35.847
[Lady Featherington]
So, does that mean--

33:35.930 --> 33:39.767
You truly believed
a tea would rectify the situation, madam?

33:40.435 --> 33:42.270
[sighs] As if that ever works.

33:44.439 --> 33:47.734
[Lady Whistledown] And yet, to those
who may still find themselves

33:47.817 --> 33:51.446
out of both choices and hope, fear not.

33:52.030 --> 33:56.075
For who knows when
and where one's fortunes may change?

33:56.159 --> 33:59.245
-He was… He was completely in his cups!
-[both laughing]

34:01.497 --> 34:03.291
I'd wager the both of you were.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.752
-And I would take your bet.
-[Siena giggles]

34:06.169 --> 34:07.712
-Oh…
-[Anthony kissing]

34:10.923 --> 34:12.008
[Siena moans lightly]

34:14.177 --> 34:15.678
We must part.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.889
I should prepare for my show.

34:17.972 --> 34:19.182
And you…

34:19.265 --> 34:23.936
Well, I believe there is
a ball somewhere requiring your presence.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.688
The last one, yes?

34:25.772 --> 34:26.689
Of the season.

34:27.273 --> 34:28.608
Though… [clears throat]

34:28.691 --> 34:31.152
…unfortunately, not the last of mine.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.447
Does that mean
you'll dance tonight, my lord?

34:34.530 --> 34:37.033
-[Anthony chuckles]
-Perhaps a quadrille?

34:38.159 --> 34:41.370
Oh, do not tell me
you shall find some young lady

34:41.454 --> 34:42.789
to lead in a waltz all evening.

34:42.872 --> 34:45.666
I shall not be
anywhere near that dance floor.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.043
[both laughing]

34:48.127 --> 34:50.004
At least, not if I have a say in it.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.131
Now, wherever is the fun in that?

35:00.890 --> 35:02.350
-I shall--
-Come with me.

35:03.935 --> 35:04.811
Tonight.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.648
Siena, I am a viscount.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.609
My sister is now a duchess,

35:11.692 --> 35:13.528
and the duke my brother-in-law.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.239
There is no one
that would dare say a thing.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.492
[scoffs] No, not to you.

35:21.327 --> 35:25.915
This is preposterous and fantastical.

35:27.083 --> 35:30.211
-And you know it.
-I want you there by my side.

35:33.506 --> 35:34.715
[softly] Come with me.

35:37.051 --> 35:39.053
Come with me.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.269
[both gasping, laughing]

36:12.128 --> 36:14.547
-A good likeness.
-[Simon] Indeed.

36:15.047 --> 36:18.301
Though Mr. Granville did seem to omit
the gray hair or two I've surely gained

36:18.384 --> 36:20.219
from the emotions of the past few weeks.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.804
[both chuckle lightly]

36:23.306 --> 36:26.976
-Perhaps a few wrinkles too.
-Oh! You wound me.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.190
We should discuss
the order of events this evening.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.107
Naturally.

36:33.649 --> 36:38.196
I think it wise for us to engage
in three dances, would you say?

36:38.279 --> 36:41.449
-Two.
-It is our ball, Your Grace.

36:42.074 --> 36:45.828
I do fear two dances
may leave our guests terribly unexcited.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.496
It is better than the opposite,

36:47.580 --> 36:49.665
leaving them overly excited
and terribly unruly.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.250
Two dances at most.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.294
[both laughing]

37:01.010 --> 37:04.597
You were wonderful today
with Gregory and Hyacinth.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.141
They adore you.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.021
Children always have done.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.941
It still does not mean
I want any of my own.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.194
Of course.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.574
Your Graces, your guests are arriving.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.581
One last dance, it is.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.548
[guests chattering excitedly]

37:42.635 --> 37:44.637
[light waltz music playing]

37:54.981 --> 37:58.067
[indistinct chattering]

38:31.892 --> 38:33.853
Perhaps you should like
to paint a picture?

38:35.771 --> 38:37.148
[Violet chuckles]

38:37.231 --> 38:40.985
Dearest, you must see this as a rehearsal.

38:41.610 --> 38:45.489
Until you are officially out,
you need not feel so strained tonight.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.615
As if I shall feel anything

38:46.699 --> 38:48.534
but the inability to breathe
in this corset.

38:48.617 --> 38:50.494
My dear… [chuckles]

38:53.372 --> 38:55.541
For someone who hates ballgowns…

38:56.625 --> 38:58.336
you look exquisite in one.

38:59.253 --> 39:00.129
Yeah.

39:03.090 --> 39:05.634
If you wish to go up to the library
for the rest of the evening,

39:05.718 --> 39:06.969
I shall not say a word.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.263
Nor shall I blame you.

39:10.514 --> 39:11.724
I am merely glad you came.

39:14.226 --> 39:15.186
Sister…

39:17.480 --> 39:18.939
I suppose I should thank you.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.484
[scoffs] Whatever for?

39:22.151 --> 39:23.402
For being so perfect…

39:24.278 --> 39:25.696
so I do not have to be.

39:40.127 --> 39:41.504
Oh! Look who's here.

39:42.671 --> 39:43.547
[Philipa gasps]

39:48.969 --> 39:51.639
Lady Featherington,
what a pleasant surprise.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.182
We did not expect to see you here.

39:53.265 --> 39:54.308
What can I say?

39:54.975 --> 39:58.104
The duchess extended
an invitation personally.

39:58.771 --> 40:02.108
Circumstances change, ladies.
Sometimes overnight.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.944
We hear your husband
secured himself a win the other day.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.530
Where is he? Still out celebrating?

40:07.613 --> 40:10.116
One circumstance
that has most likely not changed,

40:10.199 --> 40:11.158
I imagine.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.162
[raucous laughter]

40:17.123 --> 40:19.625
Someone special in here for me, I presume?

40:19.708 --> 40:21.585
Only the best for you, my lord.

40:27.216 --> 40:30.052
-[ominous music plays]
-[man] Featherington.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.011
Join us.

40:38.060 --> 40:40.062
[music and chattering continue]

41:02.877 --> 41:04.462
-Enjoying your evening?
-What?

41:05.588 --> 41:07.089
Are you enjoying your evening?

41:07.173 --> 41:09.884
Ah… Y-- Yes.
I just came from the dance floor.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.427
I did not see you.

41:11.510 --> 41:15.431
I was in the back of the dance floor.
It was quite crowded,

41:15.514 --> 41:16.974
so… [chuckles nervously]

41:18.559 --> 41:19.894
-Colin--
-Pen--

41:20.769 --> 41:22.271
[Penelope chuckles nervously]

41:22.354 --> 41:25.441
I owe you an apology.
I did not see it at first,

41:25.524 --> 41:27.818
but I know you were only trying
to prevent me from heartache

41:27.902 --> 41:29.236
with Miss Thompson, and…

41:30.196 --> 41:31.238
[sighs]

41:31.322 --> 41:33.449
-And I was a fool.
-You were not a fool.

41:33.532 --> 41:36.911
You merely believed yourself in love.
One should never apologize for that.

41:38.204 --> 41:40.122
One finds oneself
in such an incredible position,

41:40.206 --> 41:42.625
and, well, one should declare it…

41:43.626 --> 41:45.836
assuredly, fervently…

41:47.588 --> 41:48.797
loudly.

41:51.383 --> 41:53.052
Colin, I wish to tell you something.

41:53.135 --> 41:55.387
I have something
I wish to tell you as well, Pen.

41:59.016 --> 41:59.850
I am leaving.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.978
First thing tomorrow morning,
I begin my tour.

42:03.062 --> 42:05.022
I am to start in the Mediterranean.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.816
It was actually you who inspired me.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.487
You kept reminding me
how much I longed for travel.

42:12.655 --> 42:14.240
Oh, um… What was it you wished to say?

42:14.323 --> 42:16.158
I don't remember. [clears throat]

42:16.242 --> 42:17.535
-Shall we dance, Pen?
-No.

42:17.618 --> 42:21.539
Um… I am all danced out
for the night, Colin.

42:23.207 --> 42:24.625
Good luck on your tour.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.594
[Eloise] Pen!
Look, the queen. She is here.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.763
Now is my chance
to find out her plans for Whistledown.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.268
Pen, is everything all right?

42:43.185 --> 42:44.311
Entirely all right.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.188
The queen.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.440
Go before you miss your chance.

42:51.819 --> 42:52.736
[Eloise sighs]

42:52.820 --> 42:54.071
[groans]

42:55.406 --> 42:58.117
-[chuckles lightly]
-One does not approach Her Majesty.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.244
I require an audience.

43:00.327 --> 43:01.954
-Oh, well, in that case…
-[Eloise chuckles]

43:02.037 --> 43:02.871
No.

43:05.624 --> 43:06.792
I only wish to thank her

43:06.875 --> 43:10.170
for the opportunity
to investigate Whistledown on her behalf.

43:10.254 --> 43:13.465
I imagine she must be coming close
to unmasking the author's identity.

43:13.549 --> 43:16.802
Especially now she has engaged
such esteemed counsel.

43:16.885 --> 43:18.345
You have no idea.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.473
We shall unmask her this very night.

43:21.974 --> 43:22.975
Of course!

43:23.475 --> 43:24.727
Of course you shall.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.522
That team of Bow Street Runners
was all your brilliance, was it not?

43:28.606 --> 43:29.440
Well…

43:29.523 --> 43:34.695
Her Majesty is lucky to have you,
a man of such talent, such genius.

43:35.904 --> 43:37.948
We worked out
that Whistledown delivers her missives

43:38.032 --> 43:40.242
to a printers press on Lombard Street,

43:40.326 --> 43:43.996
all when the rest of society is distracted
by big events, like this one.

43:44.496 --> 43:47.458
It is how she operates.
She will be seized there tonight.

43:48.334 --> 43:50.461
[Queen Charlotte] Brimsley! I need you.

43:53.422 --> 43:54.256
Oh my…

43:54.340 --> 43:56.175
Brother, you must see to Genevieve.

43:56.258 --> 43:58.719
-Ensure she stays home tonight.
-Eloise, not now!

44:06.852 --> 44:07.811
Ah!

44:07.895 --> 44:09.396
[breathes heavily]

44:12.358 --> 44:15.027
-I need you to take me somewhere.
-Miss Eloise--

44:15.110 --> 44:15.986
I have pin money…

44:16.987 --> 44:17.988
a great deal of it.

44:46.225 --> 44:48.227
-Oh.
-Apologies.

44:48.310 --> 44:49.353
[Siena] My lord…

44:50.521 --> 44:52.189
[footsteps approaching]

44:54.483 --> 44:57.486
Give me a moment, my love,
and I shall return upstairs.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.368
[inhales tremulously]

45:12.126 --> 45:14.211
I thought about coming with you tonight.

45:15.254 --> 45:17.256
I envisioned myself on your arm…

45:19.258 --> 45:21.135
dancing the entire night away.

45:23.637 --> 45:27.015
But my imagination was
the furthest I could allow myself to go.

45:27.099 --> 45:29.309
-Siena, what are you doing?
-What am I doing?

45:30.602 --> 45:31.603
What am I--

45:33.480 --> 45:36.191
I am doing the very thing
I have always done.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.945
I am looking out for myself.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.990
I am ensuring my own future.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.450
Because I know…

45:46.618 --> 45:47.786
in my heart…

45:49.538 --> 45:52.666
I know
that there is no one else who ever will.

45:54.501 --> 45:55.419
I tried.

45:57.838 --> 45:59.047
You must know, I…

46:00.007 --> 46:00.841
I tried.

46:00.924 --> 46:04.303
What I know is that you are lost.

46:05.554 --> 46:09.349
And I cannot allow you
to set me adrift as well.

46:10.517 --> 46:11.643
[sighs deeply]

46:15.647 --> 46:17.024
You need to let me go.

46:22.196 --> 46:25.574
-I know I have been unfair--
-Let me go.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.330
I am comfortable.

46:32.581 --> 46:33.832
I am content.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.585
That gentleman upstairs…

46:37.753 --> 46:39.463
he sees me for who I am.

46:40.756 --> 46:46.136
Unlike you, he does not wish
for me to don some ridiculous gown

46:46.220 --> 46:48.722
and go with him to some absurd ball.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.935
He does not wish for me to change.

46:56.980 --> 46:58.148
And neither do I.

47:03.237 --> 47:04.696
You need to let me go.

47:14.623 --> 47:16.083
You're right. [sighs]

47:19.461 --> 47:20.671
I'm sorry, Siena.

47:24.216 --> 47:25.133
I'm so sorry.

48:08.218 --> 48:10.554
-We must get back to the party.
-Another moment.

48:16.184 --> 48:17.895
[horse neighs]

48:26.403 --> 48:27.279
Lady Whistledown.

48:27.362 --> 48:28.614
[gasping]

48:42.878 --> 48:43.795
Go! It is a trap!

48:43.879 --> 48:45.839
-[driver exclaims]
-[horses neigh]

48:45.923 --> 48:48.008
-What do you think you're doing?
-I apologize.

48:48.091 --> 48:50.344
I… I thought you were someone else.

48:50.427 --> 48:52.304
Perhaps you might catch up with her.

48:52.387 --> 48:53.597
[gasping]

49:27.714 --> 49:31.718
I presume your plans to separate
from Her Grace have not yet changed?

49:32.344 --> 49:33.387
They have not.

49:34.221 --> 49:35.681
Neither, it appears, has your ability

49:35.764 --> 49:39.101
to somehow hear of every piece of gossip
that transpires in this town.

49:39.184 --> 49:40.727
When will you accept it?

49:40.811 --> 49:42.562
I know all.

49:44.856 --> 49:46.900
Pride, Your Grace…

49:47.734 --> 49:50.529
it will cost you everything
and leave you with nothing.

49:51.113 --> 49:53.281
You must not allow it
to happen to you too.

50:03.917 --> 50:06.837
[Daphne] Is it different for them, men…

50:07.713 --> 50:09.673
to know whether they are in love?

50:11.842 --> 50:14.511
-Everything else seems different to them.
-[Violet chuckles]

50:17.097 --> 50:19.891
We agreed to one dance tonight, a waltz.

50:25.105 --> 50:27.190
I miss dancing with your father.

50:29.026 --> 50:31.695
The very last time I danced was with him,

50:31.778 --> 50:32.863
at a ball.

50:32.946 --> 50:36.074
There were peacocks present, I believe.
Real ones.

50:36.158 --> 50:37.576
[both laughing]

50:42.247 --> 50:44.541
I suppose
I miss everything about him, really.

50:44.624 --> 50:47.294
The two of you
loved each other so very much.

50:48.211 --> 50:50.589
It is a rarity, I have come to realize.

50:50.672 --> 50:53.300
That is not to say
it was without its trials.

50:54.676 --> 50:58.263
Your-- Your father and I faced
many difficulties, indeed,

50:58.346 --> 50:59.806
but we overcame them.

50:59.890 --> 51:02.225
We made a decision early on to do so.

51:02.309 --> 51:04.061
Mama, I do not think--

51:04.144 --> 51:08.940
We chose
to love each other every single day.

51:10.442 --> 51:15.030
It is a choice, dearest,
one that is never too late to make.

51:16.948 --> 51:21.411
I may never be able
to see your father again.

51:21.495 --> 51:24.998
I-- I may wake every morning

51:25.082 --> 51:28.168
and… and touch the pillow
where he used to lay his head.

51:30.045 --> 51:33.131
But knowing
that the two of us made the choice to love

51:33.215 --> 51:35.717
and to do all that we could…

51:37.385 --> 51:38.220
well…

51:40.013 --> 51:43.850
I cannot tell you how much peace
and comfort that brings to me.

51:45.685 --> 51:48.605
[inhales tremulously]
I wish there was something, Mama.

51:48.688 --> 51:50.649
[gasps] I wish I could do this--

51:50.732 --> 51:52.025
You are a Bridgerton.

51:52.984 --> 51:55.195
There is nothing you cannot do.

51:57.489 --> 51:58.448
[sighs lightly]

52:13.338 --> 52:15.340
[waltz music playing]

53:09.561 --> 53:11.396
[thunder clapping loudly]

53:12.647 --> 53:13.690
[gasps]

53:14.274 --> 53:15.567
[guests exclaiming]

53:23.158 --> 53:23.992
Daphne…

53:25.827 --> 53:26.870
Daphne!

53:59.110 --> 54:00.278
Everyone…

54:01.238 --> 54:03.823
I believe this evening is complete.

54:03.907 --> 54:09.287
We shall thank our gracious hosts
for such a splendid soiree in the morning.

54:09.788 --> 54:10.956
Now, go.

54:13.166 --> 54:14.125
Out.

54:14.668 --> 54:15.752
At once.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.885
-Daphne…
-[laughs]

54:24.803 --> 54:26.179
I am so sorry.

54:26.263 --> 54:27.347
For what?

54:28.473 --> 54:30.725
Even a duke cannot control the weather.

54:30.809 --> 54:33.561
I know that this is not
what you had envisioned for the evening.

54:33.645 --> 54:35.814
-Certainly not.
-And for that, I--

54:35.897 --> 54:36.773
It is better.

54:39.776 --> 54:41.861
I know
why you made that vow to your father.

54:43.905 --> 54:46.992
I found the letters you wrote to him
as a child, and I read them.

54:49.369 --> 54:50.203
Daphne--

54:50.287 --> 54:52.998
Just because something is not perfect…

54:54.040 --> 54:55.917
does not make it any less worthy of love.

54:58.753 --> 55:00.839
Your father made you believe otherwise.

55:02.424 --> 55:04.009
He made you believe

55:04.092 --> 55:08.263
that you needed to be without fault
in order to be loved, but he was wrong.

55:09.514 --> 55:12.017
Should you need any proof
of the matter, then…

55:12.100 --> 55:13.601
Then look just here.

55:15.061 --> 55:18.690
I am tired of pretending.

55:20.275 --> 55:22.610
And I cannot continue acting as if I…

55:23.737 --> 55:25.405
As if I do not love you.

55:26.698 --> 55:27.866
Because I do.

55:29.284 --> 55:30.493
I love all of you.

55:31.244 --> 55:35.582
Even the parts that you believe
are too dark and too shameful.

55:37.042 --> 55:38.043
Every scar.

55:38.668 --> 55:39.794
Every flaw.

55:40.295 --> 55:41.629
Every imperfection.

55:42.464 --> 55:43.381
I love you.

55:45.675 --> 55:48.345
You may think
you are too damaged and too broken

55:48.428 --> 55:52.682
to ever allow yourself to be happy,
but you can choose differently, Simon.

55:54.517 --> 55:57.020
You can choose to love me
as much as I love you.

55:59.314 --> 56:01.316
That should not be up to anyone else.

56:01.816 --> 56:04.069
That cannot be up to anyone else.

56:06.821 --> 56:08.448
It can only be up to you.

56:11.576 --> 56:12.952
[gasping]

56:20.168 --> 56:22.545
[thunder rolls]

56:33.306 --> 56:36.893
Mr. Finch has such a warm countenance,
does he not?

56:36.976 --> 56:38.978
And his gaze, it inspires me.

56:39.062 --> 56:40.980
Perhaps it might inspire you into silence.

56:41.064 --> 56:42.273
Prudence, be kind.

56:42.357 --> 56:45.235
You will have plenty of opportunities
to find your match this summer.

56:45.318 --> 56:49.489
I am thinking a full renovation
of our country house is in order this--

56:53.368 --> 56:54.577
Where is Miss Thompson?

57:00.583 --> 57:03.044
Oh, my lady. There is news.

57:03.128 --> 57:05.755
-What is the matter?
-It is your husband, ma'am.

57:09.217 --> 57:11.094
They are saying he is dead.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.973
The Bow Street Runners have questions.

57:35.368 --> 57:36.494
[gasping]

57:37.662 --> 57:38.705
[sobbing]

57:44.836 --> 57:47.088
[sobbing loudly]

57:47.172 --> 57:48.548
[wailing]

58:04.981 --> 58:06.065
[floorboard creaking]

58:10.653 --> 58:12.238
I do not want to be alone.

58:12.322 --> 58:13.698
I know that now.

58:16.242 --> 58:17.869
But what I do not know

58:18.870 --> 58:21.039
is how to be the man you need me to be…

58:23.416 --> 58:25.293
the man you truly deserve.

58:27.212 --> 58:28.546
I do not know how to do this.

58:28.630 --> 58:29.464
Yes…

58:30.381 --> 58:31.716
-You do.
-Daphne--

58:31.799 --> 58:32.675
I know you do.

58:35.678 --> 58:36.554
You stay.

58:38.473 --> 58:39.682
You stay,

58:39.766 --> 58:41.184
and we get through this…

58:42.143 --> 58:43.061
together.

58:45.104 --> 58:49.692
-If you do this, if we do this, then--
-Then nothing else will matter.

59:55.925 --> 59:58.469
[both grunting, moaning]

1:00:10.231 --> 1:00:11.774
[both breathing heavily]

1:00:18.072 --> 1:00:21.492
[both gasping]

1:00:22.827 --> 1:00:24.370
[Simon grunting]

1:00:24.454 --> 1:00:26.039
[Daphne gasping]

1:00:45.767 --> 1:00:48.436
[both panting]

1:00:48.519 --> 1:00:50.980
[Lady Whistledown]
If there is to ever be

1:00:51.064 --> 1:00:53.149
a grander finish to a season

1:00:53.232 --> 1:00:57.320
than the one provided by the Duke
and Duchess of Hastings this year,

1:00:57.904 --> 1:01:01.574
this author will need
to feast upon her own words.

1:01:03.534 --> 1:01:06.788
For it was this couple's memorable affair

1:01:06.871 --> 1:01:11.250
that brought another scandalous
London season to a close.

1:01:13.211 --> 1:01:17.382
As many now leave the city behind
for greener pastures,

1:01:17.924 --> 1:01:22.345
some endings seem
more permanent than others.

1:01:22.428 --> 1:01:24.180
[Penelope sobbing]

1:01:28.267 --> 1:01:29.310
[sniffles]

1:01:34.482 --> 1:01:38.945
I am here, Pen,
to help you to find a reason, every day,

1:01:39.529 --> 1:01:42.782
to endure the absence of your dear papa.

1:01:43.658 --> 1:01:46.160
I know… I know you will miss him.

1:01:46.744 --> 1:01:48.121
Share something good.

1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:51.040
What happened with Whistledown?

1:01:51.958 --> 1:01:53.751
Did you save Madame Delacroix?

1:01:55.002 --> 1:01:55.878
Indeed.

1:01:57.171 --> 1:01:59.882
And now she will be able to put right
what she botched this season,

1:01:59.966 --> 1:02:01.384
I am sure of it.

1:02:01.467 --> 1:02:05.054
With Whistledown still on the loose,
next season will be far more interesting.

1:02:26.325 --> 1:02:27.160
How did you do it?

1:02:29.454 --> 1:02:32.165
How did you endure
two and 20 years of marriage without love?

1:02:34.959 --> 1:02:37.253
You find things to love, my dear.

1:02:39.464 --> 1:02:40.423
Small things.

1:02:41.257 --> 1:02:43.176
Big things, too, like your babies,

1:02:43.259 --> 1:02:46.345
and eventually they add up to be enough.

1:02:48.598 --> 1:02:50.099
You are strong, Miss Thompson.

1:02:52.018 --> 1:02:53.728
Perhaps even more so than me.

1:02:56.647 --> 1:02:57.732
You will do well.

1:03:26.636 --> 1:03:29.889
[Lady Whistledown]
Of course, there are other endings

1:03:29.972 --> 1:03:32.517
that will offer new beginnings…

1:03:33.684 --> 1:03:35.895
[horse and carriage receding]

1:03:44.362 --> 1:03:45.905
Tell me you have a name.

1:03:45.988 --> 1:03:47.365
Oh, we located him, ma'am,

1:03:47.990 --> 1:03:50.660
the man who will inherit
the Featherington estate.

1:03:51.285 --> 1:03:52.203
Only…

1:03:53.329 --> 1:03:54.205
Well…

1:03:55.289 --> 1:03:56.207
look.

1:03:59.502 --> 1:04:04.632
[Lady Whistledown]
…however uncertain those new beginnings

1:04:04.715 --> 1:04:05.967
might be.

1:04:07.009 --> 1:04:09.512
I shall write to you all from Greece.

1:04:09.595 --> 1:04:12.557
-Do not forget to bring me a gift.
-It is not a gift if you have to ask.

1:04:13.558 --> 1:04:16.936
-I would fancy anything blue or white.
-[group chuckles]

1:04:28.906 --> 1:04:32.326
Anthony, I do not recall
seeing you last night.

1:04:32.410 --> 1:04:34.620
Yes. I was feeling rather unwell.

1:04:34.704 --> 1:04:35.788
My apologies, Sister.

1:04:35.872 --> 1:04:37.039
Well…

1:04:37.123 --> 1:04:39.542
The two of you are now off to Clyvedon,
I presume?

1:04:39.625 --> 1:04:42.211
We have decided
to stay in London a little longer.

1:04:42.962 --> 1:04:45.715
Take some time to enjoy ourselves,
just the two of us.

1:04:48.217 --> 1:04:50.344
And you? What are your plans, Brother?

1:04:50.428 --> 1:04:51.637
Nothing of note.

1:04:51.721 --> 1:04:54.473
Other than finding
and promptly declaring my intentions

1:04:54.557 --> 1:04:56.267
to my new viscountess, of course.

1:04:57.018 --> 1:05:00.521
The viscount is ready to find
and declare his intentions?

1:05:00.605 --> 1:05:03.566
Did you hear that, Your Grace?
And which young lady?

1:05:03.649 --> 1:05:04.901
[Anthony] Does it matter?

1:05:06.027 --> 1:05:08.905
I have finally determined the difficulty…
Love itself.

1:05:09.780 --> 1:05:13.117
Removing it from all romantic relations
shall make me all the better for it.

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:16.621
No more distractions from responsibility
or being waylaid from the sensible path.

1:05:18.873 --> 1:05:20.207
At any rate, enjoy your time.

1:05:23.169 --> 1:05:24.503
Perhaps he will learn.

1:05:25.087 --> 1:05:26.005
Perhaps not.

1:05:31.677 --> 1:05:35.348
-Give my regards to Madame Delacroix.
-Your regards will have to wait, El.

1:05:35.431 --> 1:05:37.058
She is making a short trip back to France.

1:05:37.141 --> 1:05:38.184
Oh.

1:05:38.267 --> 1:05:40.311
Are you not going to say goodbye to her?

1:05:40.394 --> 1:05:42.605
I did. Last night, if you must know.

1:05:42.688 --> 1:05:45.608
We went to a party together,
a very good party.

1:05:45.691 --> 1:05:47.818
You were with Madame Delacroix last night?

1:05:47.902 --> 1:05:48.903
Yes.

1:05:48.986 --> 1:05:50.780
No, please do not tell our sister

1:05:50.863 --> 1:05:52.907
that I left
in the middle of the ball, either.

1:05:55.326 --> 1:05:56.452
What is it?

1:05:57.495 --> 1:06:01.040
If you were with Madame Delacroix
last night, then she is not-- Then…

1:06:01.123 --> 1:06:02.375
she cannot be…

1:06:04.251 --> 1:06:06.045
-[Lady Whistledown] And yet…
-Oh dear.

1:06:06.128 --> 1:06:10.257
…there is no ending in sight
for this author,

1:06:10.341 --> 1:06:14.303
who recently became aware
of a scheme to unmask her…

1:06:14.387 --> 1:06:15.304
Lady Whistledown.

1:06:19.934 --> 1:06:21.018
Go! It is a trap!

1:06:21.102 --> 1:06:22.770
-[driver exclaims]
-[horses neigh]

1:06:23.646 --> 1:06:26.816
…by one worthy opponent, indeed.

1:06:29.735 --> 1:06:32.738
Perhaps I will come forward one day.

1:06:34.198 --> 1:06:36.534
Though, you must know, dear reader,

1:06:36.617 --> 1:06:40.705
the decision shall be left
entirely up to me.

1:06:41.455 --> 1:06:46.877
Yours truly, Lady Whistledown.

1:06:53.134 --> 1:06:54.385
[screaming in distance]

1:06:54.885 --> 1:06:56.887
[panting]

1:07:00.057 --> 1:07:01.934
I shall need you to push, Your Grace.

1:07:02.018 --> 1:07:03.519
[panting heavily]

1:07:05.813 --> 1:07:07.189
[screaming]

1:07:09.734 --> 1:07:11.068
Push!

1:07:11.152 --> 1:07:12.153
[shuddering grunt]

1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:14.321
[Doctor] Very well.

1:07:15.114 --> 1:07:17.616
[panting heavily]

1:07:20.703 --> 1:07:23.080
Another. Push.

1:07:23.164 --> 1:07:25.416
-Push!
-[panting]

1:07:28.210 --> 1:07:29.295
[screams] God!

1:07:32.423 --> 1:07:33.466
[exclaims]

1:07:34.967 --> 1:07:36.552
[gasping]

1:07:38.262 --> 1:07:39.513
[baby wails]

1:07:40.890 --> 1:07:42.641
[laughing]

1:07:43.809 --> 1:07:45.811
[crying]

1:07:45.895 --> 1:07:47.188
[baby crying]

1:07:50.649 --> 1:07:53.569
Congratulations, Your Graces. A boy.

1:07:54.695 --> 1:07:56.322
[Daphne laughing]

1:08:06.165 --> 1:08:07.666
Do you wish to hold him?

1:08:27.978 --> 1:08:29.522
We must think of a name.

1:08:30.898 --> 1:08:32.316
Whatever it is,

1:08:32.399 --> 1:08:34.944
I believe it must begin
with the letter "A."

1:08:35.486 --> 1:08:36.362
[chuckles]

1:08:38.155 --> 1:08:40.116
We do have family traditions, do we not?

1:08:40.950 --> 1:08:42.284
We certainly do, Your Grace.

1:08:45.204 --> 1:08:46.580
[chuckles softly]

1:08:48.666 --> 1:08:50.126
[baby cooing]
