01:12.002 --> 01:14.838
I've learned that running
a business ain't easy.

01:14.871 --> 01:16.707
And if anyone tells you
otherwise,

01:16.740 --> 01:18.741
they're just lying to ya.

01:18.841 --> 01:21.244
And running a bikini car wash?

01:21.278 --> 01:23.713
Now, as glamorous as that
might sound...

01:26.282 --> 01:28.985
Okay, I'll admit, it's pretty
glamorous.

01:29.018 --> 01:32.021
But, it wasn't always like this.

01:38.294 --> 01:40.796
Baby focus, I'm so close.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.598
Are you?

01:41.630 --> 01:42.632
Yeah.

01:48.637 --> 01:49.740
Jack! Don't text and fuck!

01:49.773 --> 01:50.874
But it's okay. It's okay.

01:50.907 --> 01:52.209
It's alright, keep going!

01:52.241 --> 01:54.278
Yeah, just like that.
That's right.

01:54.311 --> 01:56.145
You're cute... like a
little monkey

01:56.178 --> 01:56.879
It feels so amazing...

01:58.080 --> 01:58.781
Are you texting?

01:58.815 --> 02:00.818
No!

02:05.321 --> 02:06.256
What's wrong?

02:06.290 --> 02:07.690
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What's wrong?

02:07.723 --> 02:08.791
I thought you were close...

02:08.824 --> 02:13.563
Yeah, I was, okay? Was!

02:13.597 --> 02:15.032
That's past tense.

02:15.064 --> 02:17.300
I can't have sex with you
while you're texting.

02:17.333 --> 02:18.701
I can multi-task.

02:18.735 --> 02:21.738
Yeah, come on. It's okay.
I'm still hard.

02:24.074 --> 02:25.041
I can get that back.

02:25.075 --> 02:26.276
I can get it back.

02:26.309 --> 02:31.814
I like you, you're a fun guy,
you're super nice, but yeah,

02:31.848 --> 02:33.249
something makes me think
you're not that into me.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.985
No, no, no, no. I'm totally
into you.

02:35.017 --> 02:37.020
What's my major?

02:38.220 --> 02:39.823
Well...

02:39.855 --> 02:40.790
Botany!

02:41.658 --> 02:43.660
I mean, art history!
That's right...

02:43.693 --> 02:45.329
Journalism.

02:45.361 --> 02:47.196
One-night stands are
fun and all, but

02:47.230 --> 02:51.935
a guy one-night standing has
to be able to focus on me.

02:51.968 --> 02:54.805
Otherwise I could just go home
and vibrate.

02:54.837 --> 02:56.672
Just got a new toy actually...

02:56.706 --> 02:59.710
I'm gonna go home...

03:01.243 --> 03:02.378
Do you have any batteries?

03:06.716 --> 03:09.353
Yo, Jack. You get any tonight?

03:09.385 --> 03:11.754
Kinda, sorta.

03:11.788 --> 03:12.856
Nice man!

03:12.889 --> 03:13.856
Gotta tell me your secret
sometime!

03:14.790 --> 03:16.659
Level 36, man!

03:20.430 --> 03:23.367
Hey Jack! The party is
wrapping up man.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.867
Where's Tracy?

03:24.901 --> 03:26.702
she left.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.872
Well, you wanna have a
threesome with us?

03:29.906 --> 03:30.574
Ew.

03:30.606 --> 03:31.707
I'm just looking out for my boy.

03:31.741 --> 03:33.377
So sweet of you...

03:33.409 --> 03:36.045
I'm just gonna grab a beer.

03:36.079 --> 03:37.615
Alright.

03:38.181 --> 03:39.650
We should play a game.

03:39.682 --> 03:42.151
Let's play "Cowboys and
Naked Chicks".

03:42.184 --> 03:43.420
Does it involve boobies?

03:43.452 --> 03:45.021
Of course it involves boobies.

03:45.055 --> 03:46.623
I like it!

03:46.890 --> 03:47.991
<i>Boobies!</i>

03:48.023 --> 03:48.991
Hey, Brittany.

03:49.025 --> 03:52.428
Jack! Guess what?
I just interviewed Tracy.

03:52.462 --> 03:54.731
Seems she dropped you like
a bad habit.

03:56.165 --> 03:58.200
Wait, hold up, what'd,
what did she say?

03:58.234 --> 03:59.069
Spoiler alert!

03:59.101 --> 04:00.202
Okay, okay.

04:00.236 --> 04:03.073
Can we keep my love life out of
your documentary please?

04:03.105 --> 04:04.907
I don't think I can.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.143
So does that mean you
couldn't get it up?

04:07.176 --> 04:08.010
No!

04:08.045 --> 04:10.681
It was up! It was up just fine.
It was...

04:10.713 --> 04:12.782
Next time I have sex, you
wanna film it?

04:12.815 --> 04:14.450
I'm not making that kind
of film.

04:14.484 --> 04:16.052
I'll just interview Vex.

04:16.719 --> 04:18.921
I think he's a bit busy...

04:18.954 --> 04:20.221
I swear I didn't do it!

04:20.255 --> 04:21.423
I didn't do it darling!

04:21.457 --> 04:25.162
Bang bang! Bang bang!

04:25.195 --> 04:27.197
Breaking out the heavy
artillery, baby!

04:27.229 --> 04:28.765
You're shooting an unarmed man!

04:28.798 --> 04:30.801
Well, then arm yourself!

04:31.801 --> 04:33.303
Hey, Brit.

04:33.335 --> 04:35.338
Either of you got handcuffs?

04:41.111 --> 04:43.046
You were about ready to
tell me what Tracy said.

04:43.078 --> 04:44.380
Nice try.

04:47.150 --> 04:48.085
Fucking creep!

04:48.118 --> 04:48.752
What happened?

04:48.786 --> 04:50.787
My boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.322
What did he do now?

04:52.354 --> 04:53.456
Is everything ok?

04:53.489 --> 04:55.992
He screwed his masseuse...
again!

04:56.825 --> 05:00.129
Jack, can I crash here? For like
a day or two? I'll pay you.

05:00.162 --> 05:01.698
Yes!

05:03.233 --> 05:05.202
Yeah, the couch is available.

05:05.234 --> 05:07.236
You could, sleep there until
I find some space.

05:07.270 --> 05:08.272
Thanks.

05:09.905 --> 05:11.807
I'm gonna make sure she's okay.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.842
Okay.

05:14.277 --> 05:15.812
Poor Amanda.

05:15.844 --> 05:16.813
Why?

05:16.846 --> 05:18.882
Well, she's like, totally
in love with Tori.

05:18.914 --> 05:19.748
It's obvious.

05:19.782 --> 05:20.984
I didn't know that Amanda
was into...

05:21.017 --> 05:22.486
It's obvious, Jack.

05:22.519 --> 05:23.487
I didn't know she liked...

05:23.520 --> 05:24.988
It's obvious.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.022
Nice.

05:27.289 --> 05:28.525
Wanna grab a beer?

05:28.558 --> 05:29.226
Yeah.

05:29.258 --> 05:31.128
Great.

05:31.227 --> 05:33.196
yummy!

05:36.032 --> 05:38.000
So, took some good footage?

05:41.171 --> 05:43.173
Yeah, I think so.

05:48.878 --> 05:50.247
You okay?

05:50.279 --> 05:53.282
Me? Yeah. Sorry. I zoned.

05:54.551 --> 05:56.753
For you.

05:59.455 --> 06:02.526
Light beer.

06:02.558 --> 06:04.527
Hey, Brit, did you get me
dancing with those

06:04.561 --> 06:06.897
cutie-patooties from the
football team?

06:06.929 --> 06:09.031
You mean the basketball team?

06:09.065 --> 06:11.267
Whatever, they were hot!

06:11.301 --> 06:14.538
No, I didn't. Battery was low.

06:14.570 --> 06:19.542
Aw, that's a shame. Jack,
come hang out with me.

06:19.575 --> 06:23.546
I can't actually. I've gotta
clean the place.

06:23.580 --> 06:27.883
I'm renting this from my Dad and
I can't just trash it, you know.

06:27.916 --> 06:30.887
It looks fine. Come dance
with me!

06:30.919 --> 06:33.155
Another time. Another time.
Promise.

06:33.188 --> 06:35.191
Yay! I'll remember that.

06:42.265 --> 06:43.433
You hanging out tomorrow?

06:43.465 --> 06:45.167
Yeah, we should be. Yeah.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.203
Cool. I'll text you.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.344
Shake what your mama gave you,
baby! Come on!

06:55.378 --> 06:57.247
Ride me dirty, Yeah!

06:57.279 --> 06:58.282
Yeah!

07:28.144 --> 07:29.847
Gotta collect rent.

07:31.246 --> 07:34.383
I'm a wee bit short.

07:34.416 --> 07:35.351
How much?

07:35.385 --> 07:38.355
Like, sorta all of it.

07:38.387 --> 07:41.657
You hit the casino again?
Dude, we talked about this.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.659
No, I'm good for it I swear.

07:43.693 --> 07:45.128
Alright, man.

07:45.161 --> 07:47.164
Thanks. Love you.

07:49.532 --> 07:52.135
I was just collecting rent.

07:52.167 --> 07:55.104
Can I give it to you Friday?

07:56.438 --> 07:58.140
My financial aid fell
through and

07:58.174 --> 08:00.644
I can't even pay my
last payment,

08:00.676 --> 08:03.914
which means I might not
even graduate.

08:03.947 --> 08:07.183
Shit, that sucks.
Yeah, yeah of course.

08:07.215 --> 08:07.916
Thanks.

08:07.950 --> 08:10.887
Hey are...
are you and Tori...

08:13.423 --> 08:15.425
Shit! My Dad!

08:20.964 --> 08:23.199
Is Jack here?

08:23.231 --> 08:25.000
I'm here, I'm here!
Thanks, Tori.

08:25.034 --> 08:28.004
Hey I'll see you later
in class.

08:28.037 --> 08:28.906
Hey!

08:32.575 --> 08:34.344
You didn't return my calls.

08:34.376 --> 08:37.347
Just stopping by to make sure
you didn't burn down the joint.

08:39.082 --> 08:41.150
Not at all. Still here!
Not burning!

08:41.183 --> 08:44.420
So, is she living here?

08:44.453 --> 08:46.423
Tori? No, not at all.

08:46.456 --> 08:48.358
Your mother and I didn't
get this place you so

08:48.390 --> 08:50.426
you can have all your
friends living here.

08:50.459 --> 08:52.695
No... no, no, no, no, no.
We just...

08:52.728 --> 08:56.165
I just had a little
gathering last night.

08:56.198 --> 08:57.433
Paint...
Painting party.

08:57.467 --> 09:00.370
Nice, you painted? Can I see?

09:00.403 --> 09:03.573
Yeah. Soon! It's not done yet.

09:03.606 --> 09:06.176
Okay, sure.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.710
Yeah, so Tori just...

09:07.744 --> 09:10.580
Yeah, she stayed over last night
'cause she wasn't feeling well.

09:10.612 --> 09:13.183
Must be the paint fumes.

09:13.216 --> 09:15.217
You know what? I think
you're right.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.053
Yeah, I think it was
the fumes, yeah.

09:18.087 --> 09:20.590
Man, do I have the
beer shits.

09:20.622 --> 09:22.625
Hey Mr. Miller!

09:25.495 --> 09:29.366
He stayed over, too cause...
fumes.

09:31.233 --> 09:35.070
You know, Jack, we only expect
the best from you,

09:35.103 --> 09:41.143
and anything less is, well,
less, and not acceptable.

09:41.177 --> 09:42.045
Absolutely.

09:42.077 --> 09:43.413
If we find out that you're
screwing up

09:43.446 --> 09:46.082
or using this as a party house,

09:46.115 --> 09:50.754
you can say goodbye to the
skate shop. The house. The car.

09:50.786 --> 09:52.989
All of it. Understand?

09:54.524 --> 09:57.427
You do want the skate shop,
right?

09:57.459 --> 09:59.528
And the other stuff, too.

09:59.562 --> 10:02.365
Good. That's my boy.

10:02.398 --> 10:03.500
I'm your boy!

10:03.533 --> 10:05.101
I'll call you later.

10:05.134 --> 10:06.635
Awesome, Dad. Thanks!

10:06.669 --> 10:09.672
Next time, answer my call.

10:09.704 --> 10:10.706
Yeah.

10:41.303 --> 10:44.406
Run a real business? I don't
think I'm ready for all that...

10:44.439 --> 10:48.277
Jack, you've spent the last
four years getting ready.

10:48.310 --> 10:50.479
Awe come on, Professor, there's
gotta be another way.

10:50.513 --> 10:51.815
Look, I'll re-take my final.

10:51.847 --> 10:55.484
Not an option.
I gotta be honest,

10:55.518 --> 10:58.154
this whole semester it seemed
like you were coasting.

10:58.187 --> 11:01.424
Your colon cancer awareness
campaign?

11:01.457 --> 11:03.359
I thought we had a
good campaign.

11:03.391 --> 11:05.094
"Got Anal?"

11:05.127 --> 11:06.128
It was catchy.

11:06.163 --> 11:08.498
Listen, the only reason I'm
offering you this

11:08.530 --> 11:10.833
is that your father and I go
back pretty far

11:10.866 --> 11:13.336
and he has a good mind
for business.

11:13.369 --> 11:14.871
I thought you might, too.

11:14.904 --> 11:18.575
Maybe that gene skipped me.
Or I'm adopted.

11:18.607 --> 11:20.242
Frank, the manager, is taking
another job,

11:20.275 --> 11:22.111
so it works out perfectly.

11:22.145 --> 11:24.347
Look, I don't know shit
about car washes.

11:24.380 --> 11:30.754
Run it for a week, show a
profit. Do that, you pass.

12:00.283 --> 12:03.786
I would give my first
born child to caress that ass.

12:03.818 --> 12:07.524
You would give up a tiny,
beautiful newborn baby?

12:07.557 --> 12:10.426
I think I would.

12:10.458 --> 12:14.897
So, does your Dad know that
you lost your job yet?

12:14.930 --> 12:16.031
No.

12:16.066 --> 12:18.234
Does he know your renting out
rooms to your friends

12:18.266 --> 12:20.302
to pay for your rent?

12:20.336 --> 12:22.238
No. Not at all, and get this.

12:22.270 --> 12:25.507
I got a 24 on my Final.

12:25.540 --> 12:28.544
Wow! That's
fantastically awful.

12:31.813 --> 12:33.248
Just look at Tori for a sec.

12:33.281 --> 12:34.917
That should make you
feel better.

12:42.592 --> 12:45.662
No. I still feel like a loser.

12:45.694 --> 12:48.430
Yeah, me too. I swore that
would work.

12:48.463 --> 12:49.799
You know my Dad's deal, man.

12:49.832 --> 12:52.268
All I have to do is just pass
my business classes

12:52.300 --> 12:54.270
and he gives me the cash
for the skate shop.

12:54.303 --> 12:56.405
Yeah. I know, you've been
talking about it for years.

12:56.438 --> 12:58.440
But what if you opened it and
it bombed, dude?

12:58.473 --> 13:00.542
Maybe just go work for him.
It'd probably be easier.

13:00.576 --> 13:03.880
I don't know. My professor
made me an offer.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.615
Blowjob? I mean,

13:05.648 --> 13:07.850
I guess it's worth it and all if
you really want the grade...

13:07.882 --> 13:11.820
No, dumbass, not a blowjob.

13:11.853 --> 13:14.957
If I show him that I can run a
business, successfully,

13:14.991 --> 13:17.492
for a week, he'll give me the
credit I need to pass.

13:17.525 --> 13:19.596
What kind of business?

13:19.629 --> 13:21.630
Car wash.

13:23.866 --> 13:25.335
Shit.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.302
It's Big Tony and Bobby Bullets.

13:27.336 --> 13:28.104
Those are their real names?

13:28.136 --> 13:30.707
Vex, my man, how the
hell are ya?

13:30.740 --> 13:32.741
Yeah, Vex, how da fuck are ya?

13:36.011 --> 13:36.612
Come on.

13:36.645 --> 13:37.880
Aren't you guys from here?

13:37.914 --> 13:39.982
Cause, you sound like you just
fell out of a Scorsese movie.

13:40.015 --> 13:41.650
Hey I'll cut ya for that,
ya know!

13:41.683 --> 13:42.751
No, Bobby, relax.

13:42.784 --> 13:45.320
It really wasn't that bad of
a criticism, ya know?

13:45.353 --> 13:47.323
He did say Scorsese!?

13:47.356 --> 13:50.726
No, listen you ain't gotta be
from New York to be New York!

13:50.760 --> 13:52.595
I think you do.

13:52.627 --> 13:55.664
Ya know, Vex, Paulie is
awaiting his payment

13:55.698 --> 13:57.733
and it's our job to collect.

13:57.766 --> 13:59.635
I'll pay it back, guys. Relax.

13:59.669 --> 14:01.603
Paulie ain't one for relaxing.

14:01.636 --> 14:03.272
No. Paulie don't do that shit.

14:03.305 --> 14:06.742
You know, Paulie, he prefers
to break people's arms.

14:06.775 --> 14:07.609
And necks!

14:07.644 --> 14:09.678
That don't make Paulie a
priority?

14:09.712 --> 14:12.347
Ya see, Paulie lent you the
cash,

14:12.380 --> 14:14.616
now it's your job to
pay it back.

14:14.650 --> 14:16.052
Quite fucking simple.

14:16.084 --> 14:18.654
And if that don't work out,
well...

14:19.554 --> 14:23.025
things that are... attached to
your body, they start breaking.

14:23.058 --> 14:24.827
This is very painful.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.296
I told him I'd have it
this week.

14:26.328 --> 14:29.332
You better! Or snap!?

14:30.466 --> 14:32.769
End of da week, bitch! Or snap!

14:32.802 --> 14:34.303
End of the week.

14:35.571 --> 14:38.041
Yo, damn baby. You got a whole
lot of junk up in that trunk.

14:38.073 --> 14:40.375
What do you say I pull up that
bumper and smack that...

14:40.409 --> 14:41.278
Oph!

14:42.812 --> 14:44.813
Let's get out of here, Tony!

14:48.951 --> 14:50.853
Dude, it was a sure thing!

14:50.885 --> 14:52.889
Famous last words.

14:54.122 --> 14:56.092
So, what are we gonna do now?

14:56.125 --> 14:57.659
You're gonna help me with
the car wash.

14:57.693 --> 14:59.062
Sure! But hey, I don't work

14:59.095 --> 14:59.896
for less than thirty bucks
an hour, you know?

14:59.928 --> 15:01.563
A man's gotta have his
principles.

15:01.597 --> 15:02.531
Ten bucks an hour.

15:02.564 --> 15:05.000
Sweet! Fuck principles. I'm in.

15:05.034 --> 15:05.902
Great.

15:07.169 --> 15:10.673
Dude, we should hire Tori too!
Then we'd get some mad business!

15:10.706 --> 15:12.942
Sure, yeah. Why don't we
just open a bikini car wash?

15:12.975 --> 15:13.943
That's a brilliant idea.

15:15.510 --> 15:16.545
That was a joke.

15:16.578 --> 15:18.080
Think about it, man!
It can't miss!

15:18.114 --> 15:19.349
We'd be printing money!

15:19.381 --> 15:24.087
Vex, I'm not running a bikini
car wash, man. It's like, seedy.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.823
But, highly profitable and
I can help.

15:26.856 --> 15:28.957
Help? Dude, we got a hot chick!

15:28.991 --> 15:31.093
Imagine her like soaping up
your car.

15:31.126 --> 15:33.762
Maybe she winks at you, she
blows you a kiss.

15:33.795 --> 15:35.897
You achieve wood. Perfect!

15:35.930 --> 15:38.900
Absolutely, but there is more
than that to running a business.

15:38.933 --> 15:41.570
-We got it all figured out,
Marvin.

15:41.603 --> 15:43.573
You got the numbers
figured out?

15:43.606 --> 15:46.609
Psh! Yeah, Jack's a numbers
whiz. Right?

15:47.776 --> 15:49.911
We might need help with
the numbers.

15:49.944 --> 15:53.116
It's not exactly the
kind of business

15:53.149 --> 15:54.616
my Dad would be cool with,
you know?

15:54.650 --> 15:56.718
And the Professor, I don't
think he wants me

15:56.751 --> 15:59.054
turning his little car wash into
something out of a porno.

15:59.087 --> 16:00.122
I'm so in.

16:00.155 --> 16:00.957
Me, too!

16:00.990 --> 16:03.459
Who said you can
join the team?

16:03.491 --> 16:06.628
It'd be just like Senior Year,
when we ruled Liberty High.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.997
It's a little different than
student government, bro.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.131
Do you even remember
high school?

16:10.165 --> 16:12.768
You know, considering you were
stoned half the time.

16:12.802 --> 16:14.871
I think it was way more
than half.

16:14.904 --> 16:17.606
It doesn't even matter. Look, I
didn't agree to this so...

16:17.640 --> 16:20.643
But if you do, I can make sure
we actually make a profit,

16:20.675 --> 16:22.010
which is the whole point,
correct?

16:22.044 --> 16:23.645
Yeah, I mean I sure as shit
need the cash,

16:23.678 --> 16:24.547
and Jack needs the grade.

16:24.579 --> 16:25.814
Cool down guys, alright.

16:25.847 --> 16:28.049
This is my mess, I make
the decisions!

16:28.082 --> 16:29.818
So you're in, too! Nice!

16:29.851 --> 16:30.685
No, I didn't say that!

16:30.720 --> 16:32.488
Then what are your other
options?

16:32.520 --> 16:33.655
You know, we got less
than a week

16:33.688 --> 16:35.158
and you've got no money.

16:35.191 --> 16:37.160
What else is there?
A lemonade stand?

16:37.193 --> 16:39.495
C'mon. Let me hear your ideas.

16:39.528 --> 16:41.664
I thought so. Think
about it, man!

16:41.697 --> 16:44.700
The hot chicks! Sexy bikinis!
It can't miss!

16:44.732 --> 16:45.967
There's no guarantee...

16:46.000 --> 16:48.069
According to my calculations, it
would be a tremendous success.

16:48.102 --> 16:49.203
I mean it would be nice
if it worked but...

16:49.237 --> 16:52.842
We could run specials. Buy five
washes, get one free.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.544
Theme days! Hot nurses!

16:54.577 --> 16:58.581
And I'll do it for free.
Just help me get her.

16:59.081 --> 17:00.850
Psh... Dude get in line,
alright?

17:00.882 --> 17:04.185
Only a special kind of guy goes
balls deep with Tori.

17:04.220 --> 17:06.521
Why don't you try with someone
like Amanda?

17:06.554 --> 17:08.056
Amanda is totally into Tori.

17:08.089 --> 17:11.694
Whatever, I just mean
someone more realistic, and less

17:11.726 --> 17:12.894
Tori-ish.

17:12.928 --> 17:16.465
My god. Wouldn't it be funny
if he lost Tori to a girl?

17:16.498 --> 17:19.201
No! It would be uproarious.

17:19.234 --> 17:22.204
It's just that, you guys always
get the girls, you know?

17:22.237 --> 17:25.140
And I'm just, not.

17:25.173 --> 17:26.708
I should be proud right now,
but I don't wanna think

17:26.742 --> 17:29.212
about you alone in your room
next time I'm banging.

17:29.245 --> 17:31.714
Come on, Jack, let's help this
bastard get laid.

17:31.746 --> 17:34.816
Awe, dammit. I got myself into
this mess, didn't I?

17:34.850 --> 17:37.719
Yup. But this could be
your chance.

17:37.753 --> 17:39.989
Yo, my bro graduated with a
degree in engineering

17:40.022 --> 17:41.724
and now he's flipping burgers.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.226
It's shit out there, man.

17:43.258 --> 17:45.260
Us millennials, we're screwed.

17:45.294 --> 17:46.195
Look if you join the team,

17:46.228 --> 17:48.597
I cannot guarantee you're
gonna land her.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.233
Just guarantee that you'll try.

17:50.265 --> 17:52.802
Remember the millennials.

17:56.738 --> 17:57.273
Fuck it.

17:57.305 --> 18:00.175
That's the spirit! Yeah!

18:00.208 --> 18:04.214
Can one of you boys help rub
some oil on me?

18:08.784 --> 18:11.254
So, Tori,

18:11.286 --> 18:15.591
I've got a possible business
proposition for you.

18:19.628 --> 18:21.197
What do you think of this blue?

18:21.229 --> 18:24.299
I love it. Take off these
bottoms.

18:24.332 --> 18:27.003
And they go good with
these, too.

18:27.035 --> 18:28.203
What do you think about
this one?

18:28.236 --> 18:30.939
That one's cute. I like the
polka dots.

18:35.977 --> 18:38.948
This must be what Heaven
looks like.

18:38.980 --> 18:42.884
I don't think there are girls in
bikinis in Heaven, Vex! Geez!

18:42.918 --> 18:45.621
Hey Marvin, big favor.
Shut the fuck up!

18:45.653 --> 18:47.656
Shutting up.

18:49.324 --> 18:52.061
Guys, is this too skimpy?

18:55.997 --> 18:58.000
Hell yeah!

19:06.207 --> 19:09.211
For the record, this is gonna
be fucking awesome!

19:43.044 --> 19:45.047
Holy shit, dude we got one!

19:47.716 --> 19:49.819
Hey welcome. How can we
help you?

19:49.851 --> 19:51.353
I want a car wash.

19:51.387 --> 19:52.355
Kelly!

19:56.859 --> 20:01.230
Hey, baby. Did you want the
standard wash, the premium,

20:01.263 --> 20:04.233
or the 'Happy-Ending
Please-Cum-All-Over-Me Rubdown'?

20:04.265 --> 20:05.834
I'll take the last one.

20:05.868 --> 20:08.704
Please pull it... around.

20:08.736 --> 20:11.873
And then you enter...
through the rear.

20:11.907 --> 20:12.909
Yes, Ma'am!

20:25.420 --> 20:26.622
Hi!

21:40.829 --> 21:42.465
Hi! I'm sorry!

21:42.497 --> 21:44.132
It's all good.

21:54.776 --> 21:56.478
I've got plenty of life
to live but it's safe to say

21:56.512 --> 21:58.813
that this will be the best
job I'll ever have!

21:58.846 --> 22:00.415
No doubt, dude.

22:00.448 --> 22:02.851
And with any luck, word of
mouth will spread.

22:02.884 --> 22:05.220
Yeah, everyone is gonna know
about this bikini car wash.

22:05.254 --> 22:05.821
Hey, guys!

22:05.853 --> 22:06.788
Hey.

22:06.822 --> 22:08.357
Brit! You totally missed the
grand opening

22:08.390 --> 22:10.092
of Jack's bikini car wash!

22:10.124 --> 22:11.359
That's 'cause I wasn't aware

22:11.392 --> 22:12.995
Jack had started his own
business.

22:13.027 --> 22:15.497
-It's no big deal. It's just
for my business class.

22:15.531 --> 22:17.832
Yeah, and the whole
bikini aspect

22:17.865 --> 22:19.501
is just a marketing thing.

22:19.534 --> 22:21.504
Yeah, right!

22:21.536 --> 22:24.105
The important thing is just
running the business.

22:24.139 --> 22:26.976
Yeah. Yeah, sure. My bad.

22:27.008 --> 22:29.978
So you have girls in bikinis
washing cars?

22:30.012 --> 22:32.515
Yeah, Brit. It's a
bikini car wash.

22:32.547 --> 22:34.916
You can't not have girls
in bikinis!

22:34.949 --> 22:36.184
You know, Jack.

22:36.217 --> 22:38.387
We're probably the only bikini
car wash in the whole zip code,

22:38.419 --> 22:39.854
if not the whole fucking state.

22:39.888 --> 22:41.524
We're pioneers, bro!
It's inspiring!

22:41.556 --> 22:44.392
Wow. Just like Lewis & Clark.

22:44.426 --> 22:46.262
Wait 'til the girls in my film
class hear about this.

22:46.294 --> 22:47.396
No. I don't know about...

22:47.428 --> 22:48.997
Can I be in it?

22:49.031 --> 22:49.932
Yes!

22:49.966 --> 22:50.900
You should totally put
me in it too.

22:50.932 --> 22:53.399
People love looking at this
fucking face.

22:53.434 --> 22:53.536
I'll start filming tomorrow.

22:53.569 --> 22:54.770
Nah, nah...
You know, I'd...

22:54.803 --> 22:57.406
I'd have to get permission and
there's forms to fill out...

22:57.438 --> 22:58.373
Don't worry, Jack.

22:58.407 --> 23:00.309
I'll just blur out the name
when I edit it.

23:00.342 --> 23:02.178
No... Ya know, and the
customers...

23:02.210 --> 23:05.213
Yeah, I'll just shoot around
them or blur them out, too.

23:09.618 --> 23:10.820
Cool.

23:12.621 --> 23:13.488
Great.

23:17.059 --> 23:17.927
Hey.

23:19.594 --> 23:20.262
Sorry.

23:20.295 --> 23:22.430
Why? I'm just making a Pop Tart.

23:22.464 --> 23:24.066
Okay. Sorry.

23:24.099 --> 23:26.168
Amanda, stop apologizing.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.201
I know, I know, I'm sor...

23:27.236 --> 23:29.438
Hey, I'm sorry for blowing
you off last night.

23:29.470 --> 23:31.306
I just have a lot going on.

23:31.340 --> 23:33.042
Yeah, I totally understand.

23:33.074 --> 23:36.444
My ex is just like... I mean,
look at this body.

23:36.477 --> 23:39.047
Would you go anywhere else?

23:39.081 --> 23:41.950
No, I wouldn't never go
anywhere else, ever.

23:43.118 --> 23:45.087
Like... Like if I were him.

23:46.255 --> 23:47.590
And my lips.

23:47.622 --> 23:50.926
I mean, these are just the
perfect lips to kiss with.

23:50.958 --> 23:54.330
Yeah, pretty perfect lips.

23:54.362 --> 23:56.931
Yeah, yours are nice, too.

23:56.965 --> 23:58.601
No! They're not.

23:58.633 --> 24:01.269
Ya know, if you dressed a
little different,

24:01.303 --> 24:03.938
more confident, and a
little sexier,

24:03.971 --> 24:05.974
I think you'd get more
guys' attention.

24:09.511 --> 24:11.347
Stop! What are you doing?

24:11.380 --> 24:13.482
Let me see your stomach.

24:13.515 --> 24:15.284
See? Perfect.

24:15.316 --> 24:16.517
Whatever.

24:16.551 --> 24:18.553
Anyways, thank you.

24:25.127 --> 24:26.395
Your Pop Tart.

24:26.428 --> 24:29.130
Yeah. Is it cool if I
crash with you?

24:29.163 --> 24:31.967
The couch smells like
puke and chips.

24:31.999 --> 24:32.868
Yeah!

24:34.169 --> 24:36.639
I mean, yeah, sure. Whatever.

24:36.671 --> 24:38.874
Cool. You're the best, Amanda.

24:55.157 --> 24:56.659
Hey, guys. Just real quick,

24:56.691 --> 24:59.160
while I've got ya, I just wanted
to thank, everyone, for today.

24:59.194 --> 25:01.263
You guys were great, really.

25:01.295 --> 25:03.332
I gotta run this thing
for a week,

25:03.364 --> 25:05.534
so if you guys can help out
for a few more days,

25:05.566 --> 25:06.669
that would be awesome.

25:06.701 --> 25:08.670
I can't. I got an
internship.

25:08.704 --> 25:10.673
My friend Mia might be
able to help.

25:10.706 --> 25:12.174
She's super cute.

25:12.207 --> 25:15.076
Super cute is a great quality.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.413
I had fun, but I'm beat.

25:17.446 --> 25:19.014
Well, ya know, once we actually
get a rhythm going,

25:19.046 --> 25:20.682
I sure we can work more
efficiently, guys.

25:20.716 --> 25:21.883
I've done some calculations,

25:21.917 --> 25:25.688
and if we are busy as my numbers
suggest we may indeed be,

25:25.720 --> 25:27.555
anyone working as a bikini
person could bring home

25:27.589 --> 25:31.360
at least two hundred bucks
a day, maybe more,

25:31.392 --> 25:33.696
depending on weather concerns
and of course, traffic.

25:34.996 --> 25:36.164
Shut up, Marvin.

25:36.198 --> 25:38.333
I did get some nice tips.

25:38.367 --> 25:40.569
You know, the pizza place
is really flexible.

25:40.601 --> 25:42.705
I can still be cashier.

25:42.737 --> 25:45.573
I'm in. I don't mind
showing off my girls.

25:45.607 --> 25:48.444
Your girls?

25:48.476 --> 25:51.746
Whoo! Those girls.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.615
I am a big fan of those girls.

25:53.648 --> 25:56.051
But do the girls need to be
out at the moment?

25:56.083 --> 25:59.721
Yes, they do. You wanna
touch 'em, Brit?

25:59.755 --> 26:03.324
They're all natural.
Well, not really.

26:03.358 --> 26:04.726
No, thanks, I'm good.

26:04.759 --> 26:07.195
Yeah, maybe we could just,
ya know...

26:07.228 --> 26:10.598
Sure thing, Jack. Don't want
to offend anyone.

26:10.631 --> 26:11.533
You're not offending me,

26:11.566 --> 26:13.634
you just don't need to
fling them around.

26:13.668 --> 26:15.270
Okay, BRATtany.

26:15.303 --> 26:17.072
Hey!
No fighting, girls,

26:17.104 --> 26:19.741
unless it involves mud wresting
or nudity. Or both.

26:21.142 --> 26:25.246
Hey, Jack, this is gonna
be awesome.

26:36.824 --> 26:40.763
Aw, that feels so good.

26:40.795 --> 26:44.499
You should become a masseuse,
not a lawyer.

26:44.533 --> 26:49.271
I think that lawyers tend
to be more successful

26:49.303 --> 26:52.507
than masseuses.
Read that in books.

26:52.541 --> 26:56.278
Stupid book.

26:56.311 --> 26:58.447
Okay, now it's time
for the front.

26:58.479 --> 26:59.081
Yeah?

27:05.152 --> 27:06.654
Ya know? You could just quit

27:06.688 --> 27:10.124
all this stupid law business
and become a bikini girl.

27:10.158 --> 27:12.160
My parents would love that.

27:14.095 --> 27:15.663
Should I be jealous of you
hanging out

27:15.697 --> 27:17.065
with these bikini girls?

27:17.099 --> 27:19.134
Psh. No way.
I mean, it's not like

27:19.167 --> 27:21.437
you and me are going out
or anything, right?

27:21.469 --> 27:26.275
I like to keep it casual. But
if I was the jealous type...

27:29.444 --> 27:31.480
That would be bad, wouldn't it?

27:31.513 --> 27:34.516
I'm glad you're not the
jealous type.

27:35.516 --> 27:38.853
I'm sorry, did that hurt?

27:38.887 --> 27:40.589
I kinda liked it.

27:40.621 --> 27:42.624
You freak.

27:50.899 --> 27:52.834
Alright, well we've got some
interviews coming in today,

27:52.868 --> 27:54.837
but I've gotta inventory
supplies with Marvin.

27:54.870 --> 27:56.705
So, can you handle them?

27:56.737 --> 27:58.172
No problemo.

27:58.206 --> 27:59.207
Alright.

27:59.740 --> 28:02.777
Be professional.

28:02.811 --> 28:03.846
Obviously!

28:17.691 --> 28:20.228
I'm gonna need to see you
in a bikini.

28:28.236 --> 28:29.737
This better?

28:29.771 --> 28:30.773
Yeah.

28:32.673 --> 28:35.610
Even better?

28:35.643 --> 28:38.646
Please tell your parents I said
Thank You.

28:41.650 --> 28:44.887
Experience. Work history.
Blah. Blah. Blah.

28:44.919 --> 28:46.621
What are your best assets?

28:46.655 --> 28:48.657
Do these count?

29:02.970 --> 29:05.540
Yeah. Those count.

29:08.275 --> 29:11.279
Yeah, ya know.
Great resume. We'll call you.

29:13.547 --> 29:16.551
Does that help your decision?

29:16.584 --> 29:20.155
Fuck yeah. When can
you start?

29:21.823 --> 29:24.293
How'd it go, man?
I miss anything?

29:24.325 --> 29:24.927
Meh.

29:31.699 --> 29:32.934
Holy...

29:32.967 --> 29:34.169
Shit.

29:35.437 --> 29:36.304
Hi.

29:36.838 --> 29:37.839
Hi.

29:37.872 --> 29:40.742
April told me about the job?
Here's my resume.

29:42.009 --> 29:45.446
Yes. Yes, you heard right...

29:45.479 --> 29:48.449
What are some of your
qualifications?

29:48.483 --> 29:51.620
I'm an excellent customer
service provider,

29:51.652 --> 29:54.288
and I'll do pretty much
anything to make sure

29:54.322 --> 29:57.959
the customer is extremely
satisfied.

29:57.993 --> 29:58.694
You're hired.

29:58.726 --> 29:59.961
Vex, please.

29:59.995 --> 30:01.229
Great.

30:01.263 --> 30:05.300
Can you tell us about some of
the other positions you've held?

30:05.332 --> 30:06.634
Positions?

30:06.668 --> 30:10.005
I've been in a lot of
different positions.

30:10.037 --> 30:11.305
Awesome!

30:11.339 --> 30:12.841
What are some of your faves?

30:12.873 --> 30:14.642
Are you flirting with me?

30:14.676 --> 30:16.378
You're making me blush, honey.

30:16.410 --> 30:18.513
No, no, no. He means jobs.

30:18.545 --> 30:20.248
No, I meant positions.

30:20.282 --> 30:24.852
I've had a lot of experience in
a lot of different positions.

30:24.886 --> 30:28.724
And I'm very flexible.

30:28.756 --> 30:30.993
Flexibility is a huge plus!

30:31.025 --> 30:32.127
Here. Come on.

30:32.160 --> 30:36.364
Most of the jobs I've had,
have been under the table.

30:36.398 --> 30:37.032
As in...

30:37.065 --> 30:38.499
No, Vex. Off the books, man.

30:38.533 --> 30:40.869
I know what under the
table means.

30:40.901 --> 30:42.638
Pfft. This guy...

30:42.670 --> 30:46.507
Mia, look, wow. This... this all
sounds great, it does, really.

30:46.541 --> 30:49.910
But see, I'm not solely looking
for sex appeal...

30:49.944 --> 30:50.879
Well, I am!

30:50.911 --> 30:51.746
Vex!

30:51.780 --> 30:52.447
Did I mention that my
friend, Neil,

30:52.479 --> 30:55.016
owns an exotic car dealership?

30:55.050 --> 30:58.020
I'm sure I could persuade him
to bring his cars

30:58.053 --> 31:00.621
here for washing and detailing.

31:00.655 --> 31:02.691
Okay, now is she hired?

31:02.724 --> 31:05.027
Welcome to the team, Mia!

32:08.156 --> 32:09.858
Dave still own this joint?

32:09.890 --> 32:11.092
Who's Dave?

32:11.126 --> 32:14.429
Dave Dugan. Or as I like to
fondly refer to him, Dildo Dave.

32:14.461 --> 32:16.430
Nobody really thinks that's
funny, Bobby.

32:16.464 --> 32:17.698
I meant to tell ya that.

32:17.732 --> 32:19.034
Like I give a flying fuck.

32:19.066 --> 32:21.001
<i>Some people call him,
The Professor.</i>

32:21.034 --> 32:22.970
That's because he's a professor.

32:23.004 --> 32:24.072
Anyways, yeah, he owns
the space.

32:24.104 --> 32:27.608
So you're the new manager of
this fine establishment?

32:27.641 --> 32:28.576
Temporarily.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.111
Good enough.

32:30.144 --> 32:33.047
We'd like to wish you the best
of luck with your endeavor.

32:33.081 --> 32:34.649
Cool, thanks.

32:34.681 --> 32:36.717
I was being facetious.

32:36.751 --> 32:38.920
I kinda like nerdy girls.

32:38.953 --> 32:40.589
you're nowhere near
my type.

32:40.621 --> 32:44.860
Enough, Bobby. We'd like to
make a withdrawal.

32:44.892 --> 32:46.127
Of what? I don't understa...

32:46.160 --> 32:46.995
Money, smart guy!

32:47.028 --> 32:49.497
You fail outta college
or something?

32:49.531 --> 32:50.799
Actually, that's kind of a
funny story...

32:50.832 --> 32:53.168
No it ain't and we don't care!

32:53.200 --> 32:55.636
We truly don't give anywhere
close to a shit

32:55.669 --> 32:57.639
regarding your situation.

32:57.671 --> 33:00.641
I'll make it simple.
Dildo Dave...

33:00.675 --> 33:01.677
Yes!

33:02.910 --> 33:03.978
The Professor

33:04.012 --> 33:08.015
and all the local joints pay
us a small weekly fee,

33:08.048 --> 33:11.485
and we make sure that nothing
bad happens to their businesses.

33:11.518 --> 33:13.188
It's a car wash. What
could happen?

33:13.220 --> 33:14.488
It could explode.

33:15.923 --> 33:17.525
Yeah, it definitely
could explode.

33:17.559 --> 33:18.427
Boom!

33:21.830 --> 33:23.765
There's nothing explosive here.

33:23.797 --> 33:25.666
Ya never know.

33:26.066 --> 33:28.035
Actually, I do.

33:28.069 --> 33:32.674
We're just here to offer
protection, that's all.

33:32.707 --> 33:34.709
Yeah, I'm gonna call the police.

33:36.611 --> 33:38.679
You put that stapler
near my face,

33:38.713 --> 33:40.449
I'll break your boss' windpipe.

33:40.482 --> 33:41.917
It's cool. It's cool, Amanda.
It's fine.

33:41.949 --> 33:44.686
The money. Or I break
your nose,

33:44.718 --> 33:48.689
then your hands, and something
else randomly.

33:48.723 --> 33:49.691
How much?

33:49.724 --> 33:52.060
The usual.

33:52.092 --> 33:53.695
I don't know the usual!

33:54.562 --> 33:57.433
Jack, today's numbers
look great!

34:01.703 --> 34:05.707
I think the usual has
just increased.

34:11.246 --> 34:12.947
How much did they get?

34:12.981 --> 34:15.081
More than I wanted to part with.

34:15.114 --> 34:17.083
How do we make it back?

34:17.117 --> 34:18.953
Hard work.

34:18.985 --> 34:23.090
I hate that idea. Any
other options?

34:23.123 --> 34:26.128
Guys, you've gotta see this!

34:38.273 --> 34:39.908
I hear your girls do a good job.

34:39.940 --> 34:41.109
You did?

34:41.141 --> 34:43.245
You heard right. What kind
of package would you like?

34:43.277 --> 34:44.110
The works.

34:44.143 --> 34:47.248
Four girls. Good choice.

34:47.282 --> 34:49.485
I hope so.

34:53.186 --> 34:54.755
Shit! This is awesome!

34:54.789 --> 34:56.858
Hey, I told you, Mia was
a good hire!

34:56.889 --> 34:57.992
Hey! Chill, man!

34:58.026 --> 35:00.262
We need to be careful, alright?
This is high end here.

35:00.294 --> 35:03.264
High end people have high end
friends, which means...

35:03.298 --> 35:04.233
More Ferraris?

35:04.265 --> 35:07.802
Yes, Vex. More Ferraris.
So be super careful.

35:07.834 --> 35:08.769
Of course!

36:08.695 --> 36:11.699
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Feet on
the ground please.

36:17.238 --> 36:19.241
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Hand Wash Only.

37:02.150 --> 37:05.253
Hey, nice job.
I like this place.

37:05.285 --> 37:06.854
Perhaps I'll recommend
my friends.

37:06.887 --> 37:08.922
We definitely appreciate
referrals.

37:08.956 --> 37:11.258
Hey, and next time...

37:11.291 --> 37:13.294
let her climb on the hood.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.405
I wanna be him when I grow up.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.012
Hey, what's up Kell-bell?

37:31.044 --> 37:32.813
Just wanted to ask
you something.

37:32.847 --> 37:34.282
Shoot.

37:34.314 --> 37:39.753
I think it would really help and
get us a lot of business

37:39.787 --> 37:43.323
if we really pushed the envelope
on the sexiness thing.

37:43.356 --> 37:44.391
I mean, I'll talk to Jack.

37:44.425 --> 37:47.428
But I'm not sure how sexy
he'd want to go though.

37:47.461 --> 37:50.097
I'm a really sexual person,

37:50.131 --> 37:53.234
so I can be as sexual as
you want me to be.

37:53.267 --> 37:54.936
Really...

37:54.968 --> 38:00.941
cause ya know, I'm a pretty
sexual person myself...

38:00.974 --> 38:01.875
Are you?

38:01.910 --> 38:04.779
Well, yeah. I mean, Vex
does rhyme with...

38:04.811 --> 38:09.817
I know what it rhymes with.
So show me, baby.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.962
Hey, Marcy! Sara!

38:21.996 --> 38:24.131
My little sisters got a
lemonade stand? Nice.

38:24.164 --> 38:25.199
Buy some lemonade!

38:25.233 --> 38:26.401
Hell, yeah!

38:26.434 --> 38:30.372
I mean, heck yes. Please.
Jack, buddy, can you spot me?

38:32.240 --> 38:33.341
Lemonades are on me.

38:33.374 --> 38:36.844
Three bucks! And we can't break
anything over twenty.

38:36.878 --> 38:37.646
Here you go.

38:37.678 --> 38:39.747
Thanks! We made nine
dollars now!

38:39.780 --> 38:40.514
Twelve, Sara.

38:40.548 --> 38:41.816
We might sell other stuff, too,

38:41.849 --> 38:43.351
in case people get sick of
lemonade.

38:43.383 --> 38:45.019
Like orange juice! And milk!

38:45.052 --> 38:47.488
Ew. Not milk, Sara, that's
disgusting.

38:47.521 --> 38:48.756
But maybe orange juice.

38:48.789 --> 38:53.093
And if you refer someone you get
a coupon for a free lemonade.

38:53.126 --> 38:54.428
That's a pretty good deal.

38:54.461 --> 38:55.463
Hey everyone!

38:55.497 --> 38:58.166
I was gonna stop by today
for that rent check.

38:58.198 --> 39:00.168
I got it right here,
so no need!

39:00.200 --> 39:03.170
And the girls wanted to see what
their big brother is up to.

39:03.204 --> 39:04.439
No we didn't.

39:04.472 --> 39:07.175
Daddy said let's see what kind
of trouble you're getting into.

39:07.207 --> 39:09.376
Marcy. Did you finish
painting?

39:09.410 --> 39:11.413
Painting? Like Jack would
paint...

39:11.878 --> 39:13.981
Wow, this is good lemonade!

39:14.014 --> 39:14.882
Jack.

39:14.916 --> 39:15.749
Yeah.

39:15.784 --> 39:16.517
Your mother and I don't
appreciate you

39:16.550 --> 39:18.018
trashing the house.

39:18.052 --> 39:19.988
Not everyone gets an
opportunity like this.

39:20.021 --> 39:22.055
Well, Jack did just start
a business.

39:22.088 --> 39:25.392
A business? Really?
What is it?

39:25.425 --> 39:27.528
It's not gonna be like that
business project you did

39:27.561 --> 39:29.429
with the banana and the
donut is it...

39:29.463 --> 39:31.865
"BanoNut"! That was
a tasty failure.

39:31.898 --> 39:33.534
No. No, dad, it's nothing
like that.

39:33.568 --> 39:34.535
I'm just...

39:34.568 --> 39:36.537
just helping someone out.
It's no big deal.

39:36.570 --> 39:37.338
It's only temporary.

39:37.372 --> 39:41.042
I see. Is it a
real business?

39:41.075 --> 39:42.177
Yeah. It is.

39:42.209 --> 39:44.044
Daddy says the only way
to make money

39:44.077 --> 39:45.880
is to be evil and ruthless.

39:45.912 --> 39:46.447
Heartless!

39:46.479 --> 39:48.015
No, he said ruthless.

39:48.048 --> 39:48.816
You're an idiot.

39:48.849 --> 39:50.851
Girls, that's enough.

39:53.387 --> 39:55.423
I'm gonna stop by in a few days.

39:55.456 --> 39:59.561
The house better be in good
shape... painted or not.

39:59.593 --> 40:01.796
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

40:03.197 --> 40:04.365
Let's get you girls some lunch!

40:04.398 --> 40:06.166
But what if somebody
wants lemonade?

40:06.200 --> 40:08.903
It'll be okay for a few minutes.

40:08.936 --> 40:11.072
Good luck with your
business, girls!

40:11.104 --> 40:13.108
Whoa, harsh.

40:14.275 --> 40:16.910
Sorry, did I say too much in
front of your dad?

40:16.943 --> 40:17.611
You were in a jam.

40:17.644 --> 40:19.046
Yeah, you were totally jammed.

40:19.079 --> 40:20.514
You should just tell him
the truth.

40:20.548 --> 40:23.084
Truth? My parents don't
know shit about me.

40:23.117 --> 40:24.619
And that's for their
own protection.

40:24.651 --> 40:26.253
So I should tell him that
I might fail

40:26.287 --> 40:28.089
the only class he wants
me to pass,

40:28.122 --> 40:30.191
that I got fired from the job
I was supposed to keep

40:30.224 --> 40:33.193
to pay rent and that I run
a bikini car wash?

40:33.227 --> 40:35.330
The truth rocks. My opinion.

40:35.363 --> 40:37.098
Maybe not all the truth.

40:37.131 --> 40:40.101
But I have to admit this will
be great for the movie.

40:40.133 --> 40:41.501
Built-in drama.

40:41.535 --> 40:43.538
Just pass the popcorn!

40:49.276 --> 40:52.347
Sorry. I get nervous in front of
the camera. Can we try again?

40:52.380 --> 40:54.215
Yeah, I'll just keep rolling.

40:54.247 --> 40:56.483
Okay. For real this time!

40:56.517 --> 41:00.121
So, why I became a bikini
girl...

41:00.153 --> 41:02.122
It's all about the Benjamins,
baby.

41:02.155 --> 41:03.291
Kelly, this is my interview!

41:04.992 --> 41:07.128
But I do love the Benjamins!

43:18.159 --> 43:23.131
Making it rain, baby.
Making it rain. Whoa!

43:23.164 --> 43:25.099
Make it rain on me, Vex!
Make it rain on me!

43:25.131 --> 43:27.135
No! You're not involved
in the rain.

43:28.135 --> 43:30.171
Sorry, I was just trying
to be funny.

43:30.204 --> 43:32.273
Hey, dudes don't get rained.

43:32.305 --> 43:35.309
Yeah. Yeah.
Making it rain!

43:37.410 --> 43:40.648
Okay. Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

43:40.680 --> 43:44.251
Let me just say that I am...

43:44.285 --> 43:45.286
very drunk.

43:45.320 --> 43:49.122
But, also, on Jack's behalf,
I just wanna say

43:49.155 --> 43:52.793
that we are off to a really
good start, motherfuckers!

43:52.827 --> 43:55.030
Cheers!

43:55.628 --> 43:57.264
I need more drinks to drink?

43:57.298 --> 43:58.131
I got rum.

43:58.164 --> 43:59.300
I'll grab a glass!

43:59.332 --> 44:01.336
<i>My God! Grab me some!</i>

44:15.215 --> 44:19.219
I'd get these glasses, but I'm
a little buzzed at the moment.

44:24.758 --> 44:29.363
Awe, you're so sweet!
Like a candy cane.

44:29.396 --> 44:33.167
Actually, they're minty,
not really sweet.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.169
Sweet to me would be like
a lollipop or...

44:35.202 --> 44:37.205
Something with a higher
sugar content.

44:39.539 --> 44:42.309
But, candy cane, nice! Thanks!

44:42.343 --> 44:44.345
-Yay!
-Yay!

44:45.646 --> 44:51.586
Tori... Can I ask you
a question?

44:51.619 --> 44:54.622
Yeah, you just did, silly!

45:00.628 --> 45:03.530
I got the rum!

45:11.639 --> 45:15.209
O-M-G! This one guy was so
totally getting off

45:15.242 --> 45:17.378
when I was washing
his windshield.

45:17.410 --> 45:18.746
He even had it out.

45:18.778 --> 45:19.914
Ew, it?

45:19.947 --> 45:23.284
Yeah! That should be
extra, right?

45:23.316 --> 45:25.887
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Alone?

45:25.919 --> 45:27.122
Yeah. Yeah.

45:31.858 --> 45:34.394
I'm a little concerned.
I think there's a line

45:34.427 --> 45:36.396
that you don't want to cross
with the car wash.

45:36.430 --> 45:39.300
I mean, Kelly's nipples did
more washing than her hands.

45:39.332 --> 45:41.434
Well that's part of
the deluxe wash.

45:41.468 --> 45:43.938
Is it? I didn't know that.

45:43.970 --> 45:46.940
Sure. Or you can go with just
the nipple wash by itself,

45:46.974 --> 45:50.278
but it's a better value
if you go deluxe.

45:50.311 --> 45:52.847
Now I see. Then the nips
are fine.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.916
No, you're right. I'll
talk to them.

45:55.950 --> 45:57.518
We shouldn't have the
nipples out.

45:57.550 --> 45:59.553
Just looking out for you.

46:06.827 --> 46:09.430
Just looking out for you, too.
I wouldn't want you falling down

46:09.463 --> 46:11.466
and breaking that pretty
little a...

46:12.465 --> 46:13.934
ca... camera.

46:14.867 --> 46:17.938
Yeah, that'd be awful.

46:17.972 --> 46:20.274
You know, you're doing a nice
job with the car wash,

46:20.307 --> 46:22.743
even though I wasn't exactly
sold on it.

46:22.776 --> 46:23.844
That makes two of us.

46:23.876 --> 46:25.947
Seems like the girls are
into it, too.

46:25.979 --> 46:28.949
And my film might actually turn
out better than I thought,

46:28.983 --> 46:30.952
that is, if the girls in my
class don't steal my footage

46:30.985 --> 46:32.320
and burn it.

46:32.352 --> 46:34.621
That wouldn't be so bad,
would it?

46:34.655 --> 46:36.457
Kidding. Kidding.

46:36.490 --> 46:38.292
I'm sure you've probably
got enough

46:38.325 --> 46:40.561
car wash footage,
though, right?

46:40.593 --> 46:43.764
I could use more footage. Unless
you don't want me around.

46:43.796 --> 46:46.633
No, no, no, no. That's not
what I meant. I... no.

46:46.666 --> 46:48.669
I totally want you...

46:50.003 --> 46:53.840
around. Around, you know
what I mean.

46:53.874 --> 46:55.977
Then I'll be around.

46:56.010 --> 46:56.878
Cool.

46:57.677 --> 47:02.449
Hey, guys, am I interrupting?

47:02.483 --> 47:03.718
Actually...

47:03.751 --> 47:05.620
I need another beer.

47:07.488 --> 47:10.323
Wow. Someone has a bug
up her ass.

47:10.356 --> 47:12.492
Nope. I don't think she has
any bugs up her ass.

47:12.526 --> 47:14.462
Or anywhere else.

47:14.494 --> 47:17.998
You're the boss.
And a really good one.

47:18.032 --> 47:19.767
Well. I don't know about that.

47:19.800 --> 47:23.004
If wasn't for your creativity,
none of it would have worked.

47:23.037 --> 47:24.538
I didn't really do
all that much.

47:24.570 --> 47:27.674
Aw, you're being modest.

47:27.707 --> 47:32.012
No, but, I was thinking that
maybe we should

47:32.046 --> 47:33.914
tone down some of the
sexy stuff.

47:33.947 --> 47:35.115
Why would we want to do that?

47:35.148 --> 47:38.519
I mean, I want the business to
be successful, of course,

47:38.552 --> 47:42.622
but you know just not
with all the nudity.

47:42.655 --> 47:46.826
What's wrong with a
little... nudity?

47:46.860 --> 47:50.765
Nothing, in the right context.

47:50.798 --> 47:55.436
Is this the right context?

47:55.468 --> 47:57.905
Yeah, sure.

47:57.938 --> 48:00.941
But, ya know, the car wash isn't
really the place...

48:00.974 --> 48:05.579
But, you know I'm all about
customer satisfaction.

48:05.611 --> 48:07.914
Customer satisfaction
is critical.

48:07.947 --> 48:11.718
Aw, Jack, you're blushing.

48:11.751 --> 48:13.387
Am I? No.

48:13.419 --> 48:19.293
Just. One. More. Button.

48:26.432 --> 48:29.736
Jack, you can't feel a girl up
and leave her hanging.

48:29.769 --> 48:31.938
It's not polite.

48:31.972 --> 48:33.407
Am I right, Brit?

48:33.439 --> 48:35.443
I didn't... I wasn't...
I wouldn't...

48:35.476 --> 48:36.811
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

48:36.843 --> 48:39.847
But, Brit, look. But,
we're celebrating.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.582
Then celebrate. I'm tired.

48:42.615 --> 48:44.619
You may want to put those away.

48:46.586 --> 48:48.588
Yeah. I'm gonna go back
to the party.

48:56.630 --> 48:58.566
That's what I'm talking about!

48:58.599 --> 48:59.600
So all I was saying for is that,

48:59.633 --> 49:01.601
we just need to be careful
about going too far.

49:01.635 --> 49:05.906
But going too far is
too much fun.

49:05.939 --> 49:08.442
Especially when Tori has
a few drinks in her!

49:08.474 --> 49:10.009
Put on a show for us, Tori!

49:11.811 --> 49:14.714
Go, Tori! Go, Tori! Go, Tori!

49:14.747 --> 49:16.150
Is this going too far?

49:16.182 --> 49:17.050
No!

49:17.084 --> 49:18.119
Is this too much?

49:18.151 --> 49:19.119
Keep going!

49:25.825 --> 49:27.494
Hi.

49:27.528 --> 49:29.597
You got the poor kid speechless!

49:29.630 --> 49:30.597
Give him a lap dance!

49:30.631 --> 49:32.500
Hell yeah!

49:51.184 --> 49:54.389
Careful, Marvin. You might hurt
someone with that thing!

50:21.682 --> 50:24.218
Come out. We're having
so much fun.

50:24.251 --> 50:27.053
I'm tired. And you're drunk.

50:27.086 --> 50:30.190
I'm not even that drunk.

50:30.224 --> 50:34.595
Okay, maybe I'm a little
that drunk.

50:34.628 --> 50:37.465
You're such a good friend.

50:37.497 --> 50:38.666
Thanks, friend.

50:38.698 --> 50:41.235
Yeah. You should be a
bikini girl.

50:41.267 --> 50:43.137
I do not have the body for that.

50:43.169 --> 50:45.104
What? Come here...

50:45.137 --> 50:47.140
Tori, what are you doing?

50:50.843 --> 50:53.213
Let me look at you.

50:53.247 --> 50:56.117
Tori, what are you doing?

50:56.916 --> 50:58.919
Tori, come on...

51:01.255 --> 51:02.722
Tori!

51:02.756 --> 51:05.626
You have really nice legs.

51:12.064 --> 51:13.967
Tori, what are you doing?

51:14.001 --> 51:16.504
Come on! Let me see you.

51:23.809 --> 51:26.146
Tori, this is weird.

51:29.282 --> 51:30.150
Tori?

51:31.952 --> 51:35.155
Perfect. Wow.

51:35.188 --> 51:39.159
Why aren't you seeing anyone?
Are you a good kisser?

51:39.191 --> 51:43.296
I don't know. I haven't really
had much practice.

51:43.329 --> 51:46.599
That's crazy. You're such
a cute girl.

51:46.633 --> 51:48.636
Come on, lick your lips for me.

51:54.307 --> 51:56.510
Again, but with more tongue.

52:16.195 --> 52:21.634
Yeah, that was perfect.
Really, so good...

52:21.668 --> 52:25.805
I love you so much.

52:25.838 --> 52:26.706
Tori?

52:28.207 --> 52:31.211
Tori? Tori?

52:32.345 --> 52:33.548
Dammit.

52:50.296 --> 52:51.831
Whoa, Tracy?

52:52.865 --> 52:54.334
What the fuck?

52:54.367 --> 52:56.570
Good morning to you, too.

52:59.238 --> 53:01.342
What happened?

53:01.374 --> 53:03.110
You don't remember?

53:03.142 --> 53:04.845
Well, you were pretty drunk.

53:04.878 --> 53:09.115
I came over after the party.
I guess I needed a booty call.

53:11.785 --> 53:16.624
I don't...
Did we...?

53:16.657 --> 53:20.361
Baby. You rocked my world.

53:20.394 --> 53:24.698
I'm kidding, you passed out.
It seemed a bit rapey.

53:24.731 --> 53:26.734
But, you're up now.

53:30.269 --> 53:32.038
You're not up.

53:32.072 --> 53:33.840
Aren't you supposed to get
morning wood or something?

53:33.874 --> 53:39.880
No. Hey, hey, hey.
Tracy, look...

53:39.912 --> 53:41.715
I'm sorry about this.

53:41.747 --> 53:42.381
Your penis?

53:42.416 --> 53:44.885
No. Not my penis. Look,

53:44.918 --> 53:47.387
hey... I've had fun with you
and everything.

53:47.421 --> 53:51.258
It's, there's someone else who...

53:51.291 --> 53:55.729
Thank god.

53:55.762 --> 53:58.731
I thought it was me.
I'm gonna go text Vex.

53:58.764 --> 54:01.101
He seems like a
kinky motherfucker!

54:04.037 --> 54:04.905
Wow.

55:33.793 --> 55:35.094
Hey, Marvin.

55:35.128 --> 55:36.162
Hey, Mia.

55:36.195 --> 55:38.998
Could I ask you for some advice?

55:39.032 --> 55:40.501
Yeah, sure, what's up?

55:40.534 --> 55:44.171
Okay, I have this friend
who really likes this girl

55:44.204 --> 55:47.975
and wants to ask her out. But
he's a bit apprehensive.

55:48.008 --> 55:49.877
That's pretty normal.
Is he cute?

55:49.910 --> 55:53.013
Well, I'm not sure how one
might categorize his appearance,

55:53.046 --> 55:55.983
but let's just he's no
stud muffin.

55:56.015 --> 55:58.519
Does he have a personality?
Is he funny?

55:58.552 --> 56:02.789
Girls like funny. Funny can
be pretty hot.

56:02.822 --> 56:07.126
Like, jokes? Or ventriloquism?

56:07.160 --> 56:10.030
Put it this way, the guys
I date are cute,

56:10.063 --> 56:13.534
but they're also funny. The last
guy I dated was about a seven,

56:13.566 --> 56:16.803
but he had a great personality,
which made him a nine.

56:16.836 --> 56:20.340
Gosh. I didn't know
girls rated guys.

56:20.372 --> 56:22.041
Of course we do.

56:22.075 --> 56:26.213
So, tell your "friend" that a
little humor goes a long way.

56:26.246 --> 56:26.914
And good luck.

56:41.461 --> 56:43.163
Well, hey, shit bag!

56:43.195 --> 56:44.497
Bobby, easy.

56:44.530 --> 56:46.499
Fellas. I got the dough.

56:46.532 --> 56:47.567
Yeah, you better have!

56:49.369 --> 56:50.437
What'd I do?

56:50.470 --> 56:51.471
Ya never stop.

56:51.503 --> 56:52.371
Stop what?

56:52.405 --> 56:53.506
-You're like an earwig...
-An earwig?

56:53.539 --> 56:56.576
<i>Just nattering tete-tete-te,
day in, day out!</i>

56:56.610 --> 56:57.778
No, I...

56:57.811 --> 57:00.380
You never shut up. I can't even
think when I'm around you!

57:00.412 --> 57:02.048
But what the fuck is an earwig?

57:02.081 --> 57:03.416
Forget it!

57:06.485 --> 57:08.488
Here it is.

57:26.039 --> 57:28.042
Yeah, five. We're good.

57:29.108 --> 57:32.478
Damn. I was looking forward to
breaking both your arms

57:32.512 --> 57:33.613
and beating you with them.

57:33.646 --> 57:35.282
Pa-Paw!

57:35.314 --> 57:37.483
Lucky prick.

57:37.517 --> 57:40.486
Hey! Can I get
a receipt?

57:40.519 --> 57:41.988
He...

57:42.021 --> 57:43.389
This guy!

57:45.157 --> 57:48.127
How 'bout this, I'll give ya a
"get the fuck outta here!"

57:48.160 --> 57:49.530
That works!

57:55.401 --> 57:56.035
What?

57:56.070 --> 57:57.137
No, I'm trying not to talk.

57:57.169 --> 57:58.671
Good.

57:58.704 --> 58:00.640
But you know, I really don't
think I talk all that much

58:00.673 --> 58:02.642
to begin with, and when I do,
it's because I got

58:02.675 --> 58:04.311
something to say or to state my
opinion. And you know what,

58:04.343 --> 58:05.512
given the freedoms we have
in this country

58:05.544 --> 58:06.579
you could say what you want to...

58:06.613 --> 58:07.981
God help me!

58:16.488 --> 58:17.256
Hey!

58:17.289 --> 58:20.526
-Hey, Marvin.
-Tori...

58:20.559 --> 58:25.666
do you know how to spot a
blind guy at a nudist colony?

58:25.698 --> 58:26.532
What?

58:26.566 --> 58:30.571
It's not hard. Get it?

58:34.707 --> 58:39.680
What's the difference between
love, true love and showing off?

58:39.713 --> 58:42.682
Spitting, swallowing
and gargling!

58:44.383 --> 58:47.387
That's disgusting. I gotta
get back to work.

58:49.322 --> 58:54.193
Maybe it's my delivery.
What do you think Martin?

59:12.678 --> 59:15.682
Vex! Stop bombing
Vanessa's shoot!

59:24.356 --> 59:25.659
We got some nice shots, V.

59:25.691 --> 59:28.227
Awesome, thank you!

59:28.260 --> 59:31.731
So Jack, I have to thank you for
bringing me on at the car wash.

59:31.764 --> 59:34.367
Bikini car wash.

59:34.401 --> 59:36.669
Jack the exploiter.
He's so proud.

59:36.702 --> 59:38.471
Come on, Brit. You know I'm
not trying to do that.

59:38.505 --> 59:41.374
I'm just busting your stones.
Relax!

59:41.407 --> 59:42.742
Really, no biggie.

59:42.776 --> 59:44.611
Nobody's forcing us
to work there.

59:44.644 --> 59:49.416
We're getting paid and it's fun.
And I could make a few bucks.

59:49.448 --> 59:51.751
Maybe we're exploiting the
guys who are willing

59:51.785 --> 59:54.221
to pay way too much to have
their cars washed.

59:54.253 --> 59:56.389
You're preaching to
the choir, Vanessa!

59:56.423 --> 59:59.626
Vex agrees with me?
Maybe I am wrong.

59:59.659 --> 01:00:02.095
Forget everything I said.

01:00:02.128 --> 01:00:03.530
I'll just upload these for you.

01:00:03.563 --> 01:00:06.566
Thanks, Brit. You rock.
See you guys tomorrow.

01:00:10.302 --> 01:00:13.506
See? Vanessa likes the
bikini car wash.

01:00:13.539 --> 01:00:14.640
Shut it.

01:00:14.673 --> 01:00:17.110
Hey, who's ready to go
in the pool?

01:00:17.142 --> 01:00:20.646
No, no. No, Stop! Stop!
No! Don't...

01:00:26.552 --> 01:00:28.654
Alright, ladies, so we're
offering detailing now.

01:00:28.688 --> 01:00:29.789
So, just make sure to take
a look at

01:00:29.822 --> 01:00:31.457
the new price list I handed out.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.793
Plus we're offering
referral coupons.

01:00:32.825 --> 01:00:34.394
These are really good
ideas, Jack.

01:00:34.427 --> 01:00:37.798
Great. Marvin got us a
good deal on sealant,

01:00:37.831 --> 01:00:40.800
so we can offer that now.
Try to get the customers

01:00:40.834 --> 01:00:44.471
to upgrade, you know. It'll make
us, and you all, more money.

01:00:44.503 --> 01:00:45.538
I like the sound of that!

01:00:45.572 --> 01:00:46.706
We'll get them to upgrade!

01:00:46.738 --> 01:00:50.744
sexy, not slutty.

01:00:56.448 --> 01:00:58.151
I'm not changing anything.

01:00:58.184 --> 01:01:00.419
We want to give the customers
a reason to come back, right?

01:01:00.452 --> 01:01:02.421
Well, yeah, of course.
But Jack said...

01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:04.824
Jack's doing this for his
stupid class.

01:01:04.858 --> 01:01:05.659
He doesn't know what's best.

01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:07.760
I think he's doing a
really nice job.

01:01:07.793 --> 01:01:11.330
The customers will come back
for us, not for sealant.

01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:12.832
Without us, there's nothing.

01:01:12.865 --> 01:01:16.335
So let's give them a reason
to come back.

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:48.854
I'm screwed. Now they're working
together. What am I gonna do?

01:03:48.887 --> 01:03:52.324
Just talk to her, man.
Ask her out.

01:03:52.358 --> 01:03:54.361
I tried to tell her
some jokes...

01:03:54.394 --> 01:03:57.631
Jokes? How'd that go?

01:03:57.664 --> 01:04:02.369
It didn't. You guys were right.
She's in a league of her own.

01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:04.871
Marvin, look, they're all in
leagues of their own, alright?

01:04:04.903 --> 01:04:07.373
You just gotta figure out which
approach works best.

01:04:07.407 --> 01:04:08.807
Easier said that done.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.509
Think of it like a
computer program

01:04:10.543 --> 01:04:11.778
you're trying to figure out.

01:04:11.811 --> 01:04:13.747
Like coding?

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.381
Yes, exactly!

01:04:15.414 --> 01:04:20.286
So, talking to a girl is like
building a website?

01:04:23.588 --> 01:04:27.026
Okay, fuck the coding thing.
Look, just talk to her.

01:04:27.059 --> 01:04:28.360
Ask her out.

01:04:28.394 --> 01:04:32.631
Okay. But, what if
she says no?

01:04:32.664 --> 01:04:35.534
Marvin, look, if she says
"yes" then great.

01:04:35.568 --> 01:04:38.705
If not, then just move on
to someone else.

01:04:38.738 --> 01:04:42.909
Alright? Cause look, Marvin,
you're a smart motherfucker

01:04:42.941 --> 01:04:45.644
and some chicks, they dig
smart motherfuckers.

01:04:45.677 --> 01:04:49.048
Yeah... I am a smart
motherfucker!

01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:49.915
Damn right you are!

01:04:49.948 --> 01:04:50.816
I got this!

01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:52.852
Damn right you do! Yeah.

01:05:00.693 --> 01:05:03.462
So, do you think he really has
a chance with Tori?

01:05:03.496 --> 01:05:04.564
He needed a boost.

01:05:04.597 --> 01:05:07.100
I'm just afraid he'll get his
hopes up, you know?

01:05:07.133 --> 01:05:09.669
Yeah. But, I mean, you know,
what else should he do?

01:05:09.702 --> 01:05:12.072
Nothing? I mean, in high school,
I wasn't all that smooth

01:05:12.104 --> 01:05:15.108
remember? It was Vex that gave
me the boost I needed.

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:19.345
Megan Tucci, I remember.
But she said "no."

01:05:19.378 --> 01:05:22.448
Yup. But it made it easier
to ask out the next girl.

01:05:22.481 --> 01:05:23.682
Who also said "no."

01:05:23.715 --> 01:05:25.584
No, she said "Hell no!"

01:05:25.617 --> 01:05:29.555
But eventually, one said yes.

01:05:29.588 --> 01:05:32.758
I like that. You really
want to help him.

01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:36.028
I'll admit, it's kinda sexy.

01:05:36.061 --> 01:05:38.097
You think?

01:05:38.131 --> 01:05:40.334
Just one second.

01:05:42.735 --> 01:05:45.738
Bikini... Car Wash.
Thank you for calling.

01:05:45.771 --> 01:05:49.375
<i>Jack! Keeping busy?</i>

01:05:49.409 --> 01:05:51.010
Very! Actually.

01:05:51.043 --> 01:05:52.845
<i>Really?</i>

01:05:52.878 --> 01:05:55.981
Just... making a few twerks,
tweaks!

01:05:56.014 --> 01:05:59.585
Makin-Just trying to jump-start
business! That's all.

01:05:59.619 --> 01:06:02.488
<i>Terrific! I'm interested in
hearing about these tweaks.</i>

01:06:02.521 --> 01:06:05.525
I'm sure you'll be
impressed! Okay, bye.

01:06:08.093 --> 01:06:09.528
I'm screwed.

01:06:09.561 --> 01:06:11.564
Pretty much.

01:06:19.639 --> 01:06:21.608
Hi.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.008
Hi, Marvin.

01:06:24.943 --> 01:06:26.146
Did you wanna ask me something?

01:06:26.178 --> 01:06:27.780
Or, are you just gonna stare
at me all day?

01:06:27.814 --> 01:06:33.653
Yeah! I was... Are you
busy, like, later?

01:06:33.686 --> 01:06:36.021
Don't know. Depends. Why?

01:06:36.055 --> 01:06:38.658
Well, I was wondering if
you wanted to

01:06:38.691 --> 01:06:41.628
go out with me or something?

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.662
Me? Go out with you?

01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:49.501
Yeah. I know I'm not the
typical kind of guy you go for,

01:06:49.535 --> 01:06:54.174
but I am a nice guy.
And I'm fun as hell.

01:06:54.206 --> 01:06:59.511
Anyway, I'm not gonna beg.
There are lots of girls

01:06:59.544 --> 01:07:06.186
in the world who'd love to go
out with me, but I'm asking you.

01:07:06.218 --> 01:07:08.421
I'll think about it.

01:07:14.227 --> 01:07:15.829
Hey.

01:07:15.861 --> 01:07:16.863
Woo!

01:07:16.896 --> 01:07:17.863
What happened?

01:07:17.896 --> 01:07:19.698
She said she'll think about it!

01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:25.171
I am so glad Jack pumped me up.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:31.211
By the way, why aren't you and
Jack together?

01:07:31.244 --> 01:07:33.213
Don't mean to pry.

01:07:33.246 --> 01:07:39.084
I don't know. I mean,
we've always just been friends.

01:07:39.117 --> 01:07:40.820
I don't think he's into me
like that.

01:07:40.852 --> 01:07:43.722
All guys are into girls
like that.

01:07:43.756 --> 01:07:45.124
It's a well-known fact, you see.

01:07:45.157 --> 01:07:47.093
Are you the dating
expert now?

01:07:47.126 --> 01:07:50.229
Well, I've researched the dating
scene ever since I hit puberty.

01:07:50.262 --> 01:07:53.565
And just because I'm normally
scared of the opposite sex,

01:07:53.599 --> 01:07:56.568
I've learned quite a few things
regarding relationships,

01:07:56.602 --> 01:07:58.238
at least in theory.

01:07:58.271 --> 01:07:59.171
In theory...

01:07:59.204 --> 01:08:01.207
I've got the charts to prove it.

01:08:02.073 --> 01:08:05.512
Bye! Come back soon!

01:08:05.544 --> 01:08:06.845
See, you're a natural.

01:08:06.878 --> 01:08:08.280
Shut up.

01:08:08.314 --> 01:08:10.917
Guess who just asked me out?

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:12.185
Marvin?

01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:15.588
Yeah! It's a good idea, getting
back at my ex, don't you think,

01:08:15.621 --> 01:08:17.122
going out with a guy
like Marvin?

01:08:17.154 --> 01:08:18.790
Your ex was a real asshole.

01:08:18.823 --> 01:08:19.657
Amanda!

01:08:19.692 --> 01:08:21.995
What! I just meant for
cheating on you.

01:08:22.027 --> 01:08:23.761
I know, he's pretty dumb.

01:08:23.795 --> 01:08:26.799
Well, you should hang out
with us, too.

01:08:35.174 --> 01:08:37.877
Hey, Mia said you wanted
to talk?

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:41.247
Yeah. I need you to
tone things down.

01:08:43.049 --> 01:08:48.621
Alright, but Vex said
it was okay.

01:08:48.653 --> 01:08:53.959
Vex? Look, he's not running
this thing. I am, okay?

01:08:53.992 --> 01:08:56.161
If you can't follow the rules,

01:08:56.194 --> 01:08:58.697
I won't be able to have you on
for the last few days of this.

01:08:58.731 --> 01:09:01.166
I'm doing it because of my girl.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.902
Because you're getting
breast implants?

01:09:02.934 --> 01:09:12.044
No, not those girls. My
daughter. Her dad is a deadbeat.

01:09:12.077 --> 01:09:14.246
I had no idea. Sorry.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:18.184
I'm sorry. I should've told you.

01:09:18.216 --> 01:09:21.653
Look, everyone has stuff
going on. Alright?

01:09:21.687 --> 01:09:25.191
Just play it cool, you know.
Don't cross the line. Alright?

01:09:25.223 --> 01:09:28.327
I've got a lot riding on this,
I just don't wanna blow it.

01:09:28.361 --> 01:09:29.563
Okay?

01:09:30.362 --> 01:09:31.564
Thank you.

01:09:46.411 --> 01:09:48.279
Hey, bro! Want a sammy?

01:09:48.313 --> 01:09:51.017
You told the girls it was okay
to sex it up out there?

01:09:51.049 --> 01:09:52.850
You know I didn't want
that, man.

01:09:52.884 --> 01:09:55.287
My grade and everything is
on the line here.

01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:57.256
It was Kelly's idea, really.

01:09:57.289 --> 01:09:58.758
When did you talk to her
about it?

01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:00.392
I don't know. You know,
the other night.

01:10:00.425 --> 01:10:02.260
Before or after you had sex?

01:10:02.294 --> 01:10:04.296
I didn't say we had sex.

01:10:05.897 --> 01:10:07.366
Before.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.701
I mean, I was stressed
about cash.

01:10:09.735 --> 01:10:11.871
And Marvin said sex lowers
your blood pressure,

01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:14.307
so that's why I did it, you
know. For health reasons.

01:10:14.339 --> 01:10:17.242
You had sex with her
for your health?

01:10:17.276 --> 01:10:17.943
Yeah?

01:10:17.977 --> 01:10:20.246
And you're blaming Marvin now?

01:10:20.278 --> 01:10:23.049
Vex. I am supposed to be in
charge here, man.

01:10:23.081 --> 01:10:24.249
You went behind my back.

01:10:24.282 --> 01:10:26.385
Well I didn't think it was
that big a deal!

01:10:26.419 --> 01:10:28.988
You're not gonna can me, are ya?

01:10:29.021 --> 01:10:31.023
I don't know, man. I gotta
think about it.

01:10:33.759 --> 01:10:35.762
Stupid fucking penis!

01:10:38.164 --> 01:10:39.232
-Hey!
-Hey!

01:10:39.264 --> 01:10:43.302
So, did you fire, Vex? He's
refusing to get drunk.

01:10:43.335 --> 01:10:47.407
No, that'd be pretty ruthless.
Or is it heartless?

01:10:47.439 --> 01:10:50.643
Not sure. Ask your sisters.

01:10:54.213 --> 01:10:57.015
So, does the inventor of
Easy-Corn think running

01:10:57.049 --> 01:10:59.085
a business is harder then
he thought it'd be?

01:10:59.117 --> 01:11:02.155
First of all, Easy-Corn could
be a hit, if marketed well.

01:11:02.187 --> 01:11:04.222
Dude, it's corn, in a baggy!

01:11:04.255 --> 01:11:06.325
It's the perfect snack! Come on.

01:11:06.357 --> 01:11:08.226
And now, a bikini car wash.

01:11:08.259 --> 01:11:10.162
My ideas are just ahead
of their time.

01:11:10.196 --> 01:11:13.198
Sure, that's what it is.

01:11:14.799 --> 01:11:16.302
My Dad's gonna kill me.

01:11:16.335 --> 01:11:21.441
Probably. But, fuck it, ya know?
You're not your dad.

01:11:21.473 --> 01:11:25.110
And, I didn't think the bikini
car wash was the best plan.

01:11:25.143 --> 01:11:28.914
But you know what? It works
and it's helping everyone.

01:11:28.947 --> 01:11:31.950
Yeah, and it saved Vex from
getting his legs broken.

01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:35.722
Can Vex be saved?

01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:39.124
It's weird, and I never thought
I'd say it, Easy-Corn,

01:11:39.157 --> 01:11:43.162
but your bikini car wash is
actually doing some good.

01:11:44.162 --> 01:11:47.133
Girls in my class would kill
me for saying that.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:53.005
Well, look. If they do, just
make sure you film it.

01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:46.526
You think she's with her ex?

01:12:46.558 --> 01:12:48.393
Yeah. Probably.

01:12:48.427 --> 01:12:51.197
She say anything about
going out with me?

01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:52.098
No.

01:12:55.934 --> 01:13:01.039
Why do we like her? Is she
even our type?

01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:04.410
Is it just because she's hot?
If she went for me,

01:13:04.442 --> 01:13:08.046
it would only be temporary.
I know that.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.149
I even calculated the chance
that she was actually into me

01:13:10.182 --> 01:13:12.552
and it is infinitesimally small.

01:13:12.585 --> 01:13:14.921
I probably have the
same chance.

01:13:14.954 --> 01:13:20.425
No. I calculated yours, too.
It was marginally higher.

01:13:20.459 --> 01:13:22.295
And how did you calculate that,
exactly?

01:13:22.327 --> 01:13:25.330
Charts and graphs mainly.
It's very complicated.

01:13:27.265 --> 01:13:29.902
I didn't know she's into
girls, too.

01:13:29.934 --> 01:13:32.905
But I can't say
I blame her

01:13:32.937 --> 01:13:34.439
You look magnificent
in a bikini.

01:13:34.473 --> 01:13:36.342
No, that must be the
booze talking.

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:40.213
Nope. I have a very high
alcohol tolerance.

01:13:40.245 --> 01:13:43.248
Well, it was fun, but it's
just not really my thing.

01:13:43.281 --> 01:13:47.452
Just did it for her.
Dumb, right?

01:13:47.486 --> 01:13:50.923
Not at all. I don't dress up
nice for just anyone,

01:13:50.955 --> 01:13:53.592
except for like a prom date or
something like that you know...

01:13:53.625 --> 01:13:54.526
You know, I think a nice shirt

01:13:54.561 --> 01:13:56.595
is a lot different than
a bikini, Marvin.

01:13:56.629 --> 01:14:02.602
Yeah, I guess. You look
fantastic now, too.

01:14:02.634 --> 01:14:08.473
Not just in a bikini. I just
never noticed before.

01:14:08.506 --> 01:14:10.509
Not sure why.

01:14:13.379 --> 01:14:17.617
If I were Tori, I'd totally
be into you.

01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:19.853
If I were her...

01:14:41.272 --> 01:14:45.277
Tor... I'm gonna...

01:14:50.715 --> 01:14:52.550
Hey.

01:14:52.584 --> 01:14:54.987
Looked like you were having fun.

01:14:55.019 --> 01:14:57.924
No, it was nothing.
Where were you?

01:14:57.956 --> 01:15:01.326
My ex's. He's such an ass.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.528
I told him that Marvin
asked me out

01:15:03.562 --> 01:15:07.532
and he just got all mad.
But it's whatever.

01:15:07.566 --> 01:15:09.102
Come here.

01:15:12.204 --> 01:15:14.139
I really love this dress on you.

01:15:14.173 --> 01:15:15.675
Thank you.

01:15:15.707 --> 01:15:18.911
I told you that you had
really nice legs.

01:15:46.205 --> 01:15:48.207
You feel nice, baby.

01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:52.744
Are you drunk already?

01:15:52.777 --> 01:15:54.981
A teeny bit.

01:15:56.781 --> 01:15:59.317
Come on, I thought you
were having fun...

01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:04.357
Yeah, it was fun, but I just
don't think you're my type.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.268
Where were we?

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:21.740
Well... we were sitting
on the couch.

01:16:21.773 --> 01:16:24.977
And there was kissing.

01:16:30.049 --> 01:16:31.484
Like that?

01:16:31.517 --> 01:16:33.519
I-ffirmative.

01:16:41.326 --> 01:16:44.630
But what about Tori?

01:16:44.662 --> 01:16:46.665
She's not our type.

01:16:59.344 --> 01:16:59.779
Hey, Brittany.

01:16:59.812 --> 01:17:01.380
Hey.

01:17:01.412 --> 01:17:06.184
Look, I'm sorry if I was mopey
and lame last night.

01:17:06.218 --> 01:17:10.122
You were mopey. And super lame.

01:17:10.155 --> 01:17:14.393
And well, I thought about
what you said the other day...

01:17:14.425 --> 01:17:16.294
and I gotta come clean to my
Dad and the professor.

01:17:16.327 --> 01:17:18.464
It's really my only option.

01:17:18.496 --> 01:17:21.500
You're gonna have to
let me film that.

01:17:22.867 --> 01:17:27.606
So, Jack, what makes a
successful business?

01:17:27.638 --> 01:17:38.817
Hard work, good work
ethic. Hard work...

01:17:40.486 --> 01:17:42.688
You said that already!

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:47.826
Yo, Jack. Hey, bro. Do
you got a sec?

01:17:50.362 --> 01:17:51.430
Sure.

01:17:51.463 --> 01:17:55.835
So, I just want to say
that...

01:17:55.867 --> 01:17:59.237
I'm sorry for going behind
your back.

01:17:59.271 --> 01:18:02.340
You know, I really do want this
to succeed. And not just for me,

01:18:02.374 --> 01:18:03.843
and the fact that I can
basically

01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:06.211
like look at boobies all day.

01:18:06.245 --> 01:18:12.351
But because you're my best
friend, ya know. And...

01:18:12.384 --> 01:18:15.121
I think you're a kick-ass boss.

01:18:15.153 --> 01:18:16.188
Thanks, man.

01:18:16.222 --> 01:18:18.224
You just don't want to be
kicked out of the house.

01:18:18.256 --> 01:18:21.259
Yeah, that, too...
And the boobies.

01:18:25.763 --> 01:18:26.798
Sorry about that.

01:18:26.831 --> 01:18:29.869
It's cool, but I do have to
tell you something.

01:18:29.902 --> 01:18:31.871
Okay, shoot.

01:18:31.903 --> 01:18:33.738
What the hell, man!
I paid my debt!

01:18:33.772 --> 01:18:35.875
I'm not here for your debt.
I quit Paulie's gang.

01:18:35.907 --> 01:18:37.809
But I'm out of money, so
I'm here to take yours.

01:18:37.843 --> 01:18:38.878
Where do you keep
the cash, bitch?

01:18:38.911 --> 01:18:40.246
Dude, we just made a deposit.

01:18:40.278 --> 01:18:41.513
Bullshit!

01:18:41.546 --> 01:18:42.380
Dude, why don't you just like
rob a gas station or something.

01:18:42.415 --> 01:18:44.650
I know yous guys gots it
here somewhere!

01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:45.851
We ain'ts gots no money, man.

01:18:45.884 --> 01:18:49.288
Alright that's bullshit, and
don't make fun of my accent!

01:18:50.656 --> 01:18:52.658
You should never quit a job
without a back-up plan.

01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:54.393
This is my back-up plan!

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:55.259
Not a very good one.

01:18:55.294 --> 01:18:56.562
Even a retail job will
be something.

01:18:56.594 --> 01:18:57.762
Yeah, like a stock boy
or something.

01:18:57.795 --> 01:18:59.164
Yeah. Except you do have
to work holidays.

01:18:59.197 --> 01:19:00.298
True, and the customers are...

01:19:00.331 --> 01:19:02.901
I'm not working fucking retail!

01:19:02.934 --> 01:19:04.370
They're just trying
to help, man.

01:19:04.402 --> 01:19:06.237
You shut your mouth, dickbag!

01:19:06.271 --> 01:19:07.939
Why didn't you yell at them
when they suggested retail?

01:19:07.973 --> 01:19:10.242
It was your condescending tone,
you freaking dweeb!

01:19:10.275 --> 01:19:11.643
I wasn't condescending!

01:19:11.677 --> 01:19:14.412
Fine, they fired me.
Alright. Ya happy?

01:19:14.446 --> 01:19:15.781
They said I was being
too temperamental.

01:19:15.813 --> 01:19:17.782
Which is bullshit, I mean,
yeah, I like to kick shit

01:19:17.816 --> 01:19:19.017
and blow things up every
once in a while.

01:19:19.050 --> 01:19:22.388
But considering my upbringing,
I'm pretty fucking low-key!

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:23.254
Low-key?

01:19:23.287 --> 01:19:24.255
Alright, that's it.

01:19:24.289 --> 01:19:26.291
Wait a second there mister!

01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:53.352
Bitch, I will kick your ass!

01:19:53.384 --> 01:19:54.753
You should work retail!

01:19:54.786 --> 01:19:56.322
NOOOO!

01:19:56.354 --> 01:19:58.357
Okay, enough!

01:20:00.259 --> 01:20:03.829
Now, listen you spaghetti-loving
ass, this is Jack's business,

01:20:03.862 --> 01:20:06.832
not yours. So the money he
makes is his, got it?

01:20:06.865 --> 01:20:07.566
Got it...

01:20:08.299 --> 01:20:09.467
No! Please don't slap me!

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.436
I swear to god I'ma leave
him alone! I promise I won't...

01:20:14.639 --> 01:20:16.209
What the hell?

01:20:16.674 --> 01:20:19.445
Man, that was close. Whoo...

01:20:19.478 --> 01:20:21.347
My balls are on fire.

01:20:21.379 --> 01:20:22.480
You were pretty good, Bobby.

01:20:22.514 --> 01:20:24.916
It felt good. I thought maybe
the middle was bit much.

01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:26.251
No, it was just right.

01:20:26.285 --> 01:20:28.720
Hey, guys! Guys!
Wh-what's going on?

01:20:28.754 --> 01:20:29.988
they hurt.

01:20:30.022 --> 01:20:31.590
Bobby is in my theater class.

01:20:31.622 --> 01:20:34.492
And this was my improv final.
It felt pretty good.

01:20:34.526 --> 01:20:35.461
You get it all?

01:20:35.494 --> 01:20:36.161
Yeah, got it.

01:20:36.195 --> 01:20:37.662
I can actually taste the pain.

01:20:37.696 --> 01:20:38.930
So, you're not a mobster guy?

01:20:38.964 --> 01:20:41.500
Well, it got a little bit on the
side. I'd rather be an actor.

01:20:41.532 --> 01:20:45.003
I'm trying to get out of the
mob biz. Big Tony though?

01:20:45.036 --> 01:20:48.606
Woof... He's the real deal.
He scares me, honestly.

01:20:48.639 --> 01:20:49.540
Well, you scared us.

01:20:49.575 --> 01:20:52.611
Aw, thanks. It's a compliment.
Truly is.

01:20:52.643 --> 01:20:54.345
Can I make it up to you though?
I feel terrible.

01:20:54.379 --> 01:20:56.716
Honestly. Yeah, and your
balls dude...

01:20:57.915 --> 01:21:01.886
Two things. Number one.
Get Paulie off of our ass.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.023
I'll see what I can do. I can't
promise anything,

01:21:04.055 --> 01:21:07.026
but some guys just did open a
strip club next to his bar,

01:21:07.058 --> 01:21:08.626
so they're gonna want us to
offer some "protection."

01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:10.763
Yeah, it could "explode".

01:21:10.795 --> 01:21:11.629
You never know.

01:21:11.662 --> 01:21:12.196
Yeah.

01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:14.400
What's the second thing?

01:21:27.879 --> 01:21:29.915
That was a pretty good
freakin' idea.

01:21:29.947 --> 01:21:33.552
Exploiting both sexes?
Very smart.

01:21:33.585 --> 01:21:35.554
It's just balance.

01:21:35.586 --> 01:21:37.956
Like adding orange juice
to a lemonade stand.

01:21:38.956 --> 01:21:41.693
Vex, suit up.

01:21:41.727 --> 01:21:43.296
Yes, sir!

01:22:02.613 --> 01:22:03.581
Hello!

01:22:07.052 --> 01:22:08.586
-Hey!
-Hey.

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:10.689
You were pretty brave with
that mob guy.

01:22:10.722 --> 01:22:13.425
You mean the part-time
mob guy student actor

01:22:13.457 --> 01:22:15.126
playing a stereo-typical
mob guy?

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.095
You didn't know that
at the time.

01:22:17.129 --> 01:22:19.564
It wasn't a big deal.

01:22:19.598 --> 01:22:22.034
So, you and Amanda?

01:22:22.067 --> 01:22:23.069
Yeah.

01:22:26.170 --> 01:22:33.978
Would you ever have gone
out with me anyway?

01:22:34.012 --> 01:22:37.616
Marvin, trust me, you don't
need the drama.

01:22:37.648 --> 01:22:40.986
Besides, you guys make a
really cute couple.

01:22:41.018 --> 01:22:42.153
Just, don't tell her any jokes.

01:22:42.187 --> 01:22:45.991
Deal! And how about you?

01:22:46.023 --> 01:22:50.628
My ex wanted to get back
together... I said "no thanks."

01:22:50.661 --> 01:22:52.664
He's not my type.

01:22:53.497 --> 01:22:55.401
And you're gonna be okay?

01:22:55.433 --> 01:22:59.637
Yeah, I just need to be alone
for a while, you know.

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:02.140
Maybe like a day or two.

01:23:02.174 --> 01:23:04.643
I'll figure out the rest.

01:23:31.937 --> 01:23:33.671
So, how fast does
this thing go?

01:23:33.705 --> 01:23:35.908
0 to 69
in ten seconds flat!

01:23:35.941 --> 01:23:37.476
Shit...

01:23:40.978 --> 01:23:42.548
Paint my ass.

01:23:48.487 --> 01:23:50.489
Unbelievable.

01:23:53.959 --> 01:23:55.961
Wait till his mother sees
this shit.

01:23:58.729 --> 01:24:00.732
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:24:03.101 --> 01:24:06.537
Made it into a god damn
dormitory!

01:24:12.277 --> 01:24:14.746
Kelly! You can't do that! He's
an old guy, you could kill him.

01:24:14.778 --> 01:24:15.813
I'm fine!

01:24:15.847 --> 01:24:19.084
Jack, c'mon. Wait 'til you
see the tip I get!

01:24:19.116 --> 01:24:20.885
Look, I know you're doing this
for your daughter and all,

01:24:20.919 --> 01:24:24.256
but this is not how I want
my business to run.

01:24:24.289 --> 01:24:27.826
Did you actually
believe me?

01:24:27.858 --> 01:24:28.660
So you lied?

01:24:28.692 --> 01:24:30.728
Come on, Jack, don't
be such a prude.

01:24:30.762 --> 01:24:32.231
You need me shaking my ass
at the customers,

01:24:32.263 --> 01:24:34.499
because that's what
makes them happy.

01:24:34.532 --> 01:24:35.834
She's right!

01:24:35.866 --> 01:24:37.902
Red alert, Jack!
Your Dad is here!

01:24:37.936 --> 01:24:38.804
Fuck!

01:24:40.037 --> 01:24:41.039
Jack!

01:24:41.072 --> 01:24:42.907
There's no Jack
working here.

01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:45.177
Never has been. Thank you,
come again.

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:47.713
Jack...

01:24:47.745 --> 01:24:48.713
Dad!

01:24:48.746 --> 01:24:50.749
Don't "Dad!" Me! What the
hell is going on?

01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:52.583
This is the business?

01:24:52.616 --> 01:24:54.151
It's just, ya know...

01:24:54.184 --> 01:24:55.586
And I was at the house, too.

01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:00.526
Hey. My car is still
very dirty.

01:25:00.558 --> 01:25:02.593
One second, Dad.

01:25:02.626 --> 01:25:04.295
We're gonna need another
bikini girl.

01:25:04.329 --> 01:25:06.130
Kelly, you can flag cars.

01:25:06.164 --> 01:25:06.798
But Jack...

01:25:06.831 --> 01:25:08.968
It's either that or nothing.

01:25:09.901 --> 01:25:11.237
I'll flag.

01:25:13.804 --> 01:25:16.073
So how'd you know I was here?

01:25:16.107 --> 01:25:18.277
Shit!

01:25:18.309 --> 01:25:20.879
I can explain, Professor.

01:25:20.911 --> 01:25:23.281
Please do.

01:25:23.314 --> 01:25:25.049
I'm just trying to figure out
where to begin.

01:25:25.082 --> 01:25:28.152
You lost your job, so instead
of finding something else

01:25:28.186 --> 01:25:32.057
you had some students rent some
rooms to cover your rent.

01:25:32.089 --> 01:25:36.794
Yeah, but I can get them to
leave if that's what you want.

01:25:36.827 --> 01:25:39.630
But just so you know, they're
not just random students,

01:25:39.664 --> 01:25:41.099
they're actually my friends.

01:25:41.131 --> 01:25:43.168
Yo, Ferrari Guy is on the phone.
He wants another wash

01:25:43.201 --> 01:25:44.803
and he's got all these buddies
at a Car Club.

01:25:44.835 --> 01:25:45.903
They want a wash, too.

01:25:45.937 --> 01:25:47.171
Talk about this later. Please.

01:25:47.205 --> 01:25:50.309
So, am I getting a car wash
today?

01:25:53.277 --> 01:25:55.280
Hallelujah!

01:26:00.352 --> 01:26:04.822
Your housing situation, that's
one thing. But this?

01:26:04.856 --> 01:26:07.858
How did you end up here?
You said you were doing well.

01:26:07.892 --> 01:26:10.996
Dad. I failed my Business Final,

01:26:11.028 --> 01:26:13.799
and I didn't do so well on a
couple of other projects.

01:26:13.831 --> 01:26:16.200
Can I just say though, that the
chocolate-covered sausage

01:26:16.233 --> 01:26:18.870
may not be for everyone, but
I thought it was inspired.

01:26:19.403 --> 01:26:20.571
Thanks, Brit.

01:26:20.604 --> 01:26:25.343
Jack, I gave you a chance. I did
it for your dad. And this?

01:26:25.376 --> 01:26:29.214
This is what you did with it?
A bikini car wash?

01:26:29.246 --> 01:26:32.351
I'm sure you can understand the
professor's concerns, Jack.

01:26:32.384 --> 01:26:35.687
Yeah, he looks pretty pissed.

01:26:35.719 --> 01:26:38.356
He is. This isn't what
I had in mind.

01:26:38.389 --> 01:26:40.858
I analyzed your sales history
and this week we brought

01:26:40.892 --> 01:26:43.362
in more money than your last
three months combined.

01:26:43.394 --> 01:26:45.397
That's gotta count for
something.

01:26:45.429 --> 01:26:48.366
Hey, I just gotta say.
This is easily

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.236
the best job I've ever had. I
usually wanna quit after like,

01:26:51.268 --> 01:26:53.237
two minutes, but it's not
like that here.

01:26:53.271 --> 01:26:55.240
Yeah, and I was able to pay
for classes

01:26:55.272 --> 01:26:57.174
so I could continue
going to school.

01:26:57.207 --> 01:26:59.878
And I got the best
car wash ever!

01:27:02.013 --> 01:27:04.715
And I... got laid.

01:27:04.749 --> 01:27:05.950
Which is a miracle, honestly,

01:27:05.983 --> 01:27:08.986
but probably not the best time
for that announcement buddy.

01:27:09.019 --> 01:27:10.088
Admittedly,

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.390
it does look like they
kicked up the sales a notch.

01:27:12.424 --> 01:27:15.427
Sales are impressive, but using
bikinis and what not...

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.863
It's called marketing, sir.

01:27:17.896 --> 01:27:21.900
Plus, I mean, you never said we
couldn't do it this way. Right?

01:27:25.202 --> 01:27:26.671
Is that Bobby...?

01:27:26.705 --> 01:27:28.140
Hey, Dildo Dave!

01:27:28.173 --> 01:27:31.076
Bobby Bullets... Yeah,
he works here now.

01:27:31.108 --> 01:27:33.411
And by the way, Jack was able
to stop the extortion

01:27:33.445 --> 01:27:35.746
that was going on here from
those mob weirdos

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:38.150
that you somehow failed
to mention.

01:27:38.183 --> 01:27:39.251
Imagine the headlines

01:27:39.284 --> 01:27:41.186
if one of your students was
hurt because of that?

01:27:41.219 --> 01:27:44.022
I didn't know they
were due this week.

01:27:44.054 --> 01:27:46.290
Regardless, they wont be
bothering you any longer.

01:27:46.323 --> 01:27:47.959
'Cause Jack handled it.

01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:49.927
We handled it.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.429
Considering none of us
knew anything about running

01:27:51.463 --> 01:27:53.965
a car wash, I'd say we
kicked ass.

01:27:53.997 --> 01:27:56.934
I know that some of my
projects this semester

01:27:56.968 --> 01:27:58.202
may have been lacking...

01:27:58.236 --> 01:28:00.839
<i>Hey! Long live "BanoNut"!</i>

01:28:00.871 --> 01:28:01.972
But you know,

01:28:02.006 --> 01:28:04.041
I'd have to say that this should
be considered a success.

01:28:04.075 --> 01:28:06.111
So, if this doesn't work out,

01:28:06.143 --> 01:28:07.945
maybe I'll open up my own
little bikini car wash,

01:28:07.978 --> 01:28:09.313
and I'll bring all my
friends with me.

01:28:09.347 --> 01:28:11.349
That's my boss!

01:28:12.150 --> 01:28:14.318
A+?

01:28:14.352 --> 01:28:19.457
Not quite, but it'll be good
enough for you to barely pass.

01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:21.460
Yes! I barely passed!

01:28:23.495 --> 01:28:25.330
So that's what we're paying
for college for?

01:28:25.362 --> 01:28:26.497
So you can barely pass?

01:28:26.531 --> 01:28:28.867
No, Dad. No. No. No...

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.969
I took on a challenge and
we made it work.

01:28:31.001 --> 01:28:33.338
That was the assignment.
Grades are just

01:28:33.370 --> 01:28:37.475
letters and numbers.
But this place...

01:28:37.509 --> 01:28:40.479
To me, this... this is what
defines success or not.

01:28:40.512 --> 01:28:43.482
And the fact that we have
shitloads of customers here

01:28:43.514 --> 01:28:46.985
and more on the way, I think
that speaks for itself.

01:28:47.018 --> 01:28:51.990
Boy. I'm gonna have to sell
this to your mother, you know.

01:28:52.022 --> 01:28:52.990
Can I film that?

01:28:53.023 --> 01:28:54.026
-No!
-No!

01:28:55.527 --> 01:28:58.997
So, that's it. Your extra credit
is done. You guys can go.

01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:01.133
But we've... we've got
more cars coming.

01:29:01.165 --> 01:29:02.833
Yeah, Car Club folks.

01:29:02.866 --> 01:29:04.835
And tons more later
this afternoon.

01:29:04.869 --> 01:29:08.240
Well, we wouldn't want to lose
business now, would we?

01:29:08.272 --> 01:29:10.007
Alright we got a big order
coming in, guys.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.842
All hands on deck.

01:29:11.875 --> 01:29:13.512
Kelly, too. We're gonna
need her.

01:29:13.545 --> 01:29:16.314
Jack, I like that you rose
to the challenge.

01:29:16.347 --> 01:29:20.184
You know what impressed me?
When you didn't fire that gal.

01:29:20.218 --> 01:29:21.920
That would've been the
easier way out.

01:29:21.952 --> 01:29:26.924
She's a hard worker, just
needs a little guidance.

01:29:26.957 --> 01:29:29.527
Don't we all.

01:30:13.604 --> 01:30:16.174
So, I wanted to ask
you something.

01:30:16.206 --> 01:30:19.611
No, Jack. I am not gonna join
the bikini girl car wash.

01:30:19.643 --> 01:30:20.844
Are you sure? 'Cause there's

01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:23.180
a hot pink bikini out there
somewhere with your name on it.

01:30:24.648 --> 01:30:31.455
No, I was just thinking that
maybe if you weren't,

01:30:31.488 --> 01:30:32.991
you know...

01:30:38.095 --> 01:30:40.999
Will you go out with me?

01:30:41.031 --> 01:30:42.933
Like a date?

01:30:42.967 --> 01:30:44.134
Exactly like a date.

01:30:44.168 --> 01:30:47.371
I don't know if I can go out
with the subject of my film.

01:30:47.405 --> 01:30:48.572
I thought you were just
filming that

01:30:48.606 --> 01:30:53.010
for all your feminist friends
so they can hunt me down.

01:30:53.044 --> 01:30:55.113
When I started, it was
about college life,

01:30:55.146 --> 01:30:59.884
but then it changed. I decided
to make it about...

01:30:59.918 --> 01:31:01.952
Hey! We got another Ferrari
coming in!

01:31:01.986 --> 01:31:03.322
We could use some help, bro.

01:31:05.555 --> 01:31:07.358
You.

01:31:07.392 --> 01:31:09.961
The story of a dorky, but
kinda cute guy

01:31:09.994 --> 01:31:13.665
trying to open a business,
and making it work.

01:31:13.697 --> 01:31:15.133
"Cute?"

01:31:15.165 --> 01:31:16.168
I guess.

01:31:21.171 --> 01:31:22.174
Whoa!

01:31:24.575 --> 01:31:27.245
<i>Hey, maybe we can use Easy-Corn
in your film.</i>

01:31:27.277 --> 01:31:29.146
A little product placement,
ya know.

01:31:29.179 --> 01:31:30.314
No.

01:31:30.348 --> 01:31:32.351
No? Okay.

01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:53.304
<i>So that's how I
started my business.</i>

01:31:53.405 --> 01:31:55.173
<i>Our business,</i>

01:31:55.205 --> 01:31:57.208
<i>'cause it's not just me.</i>

01:31:58.710 --> 01:32:01.914
<i>It's these awesome people around
me that made it work.</i>

01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:05.684
<i>And yeah, the bikinis help.</i>

01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:42.653
<i>So, what's the secret to
running a successful business?</i>

01:32:44.222 --> 01:32:46.323
Hard work and determination.

01:32:46.357 --> 01:32:47.592
And boobies!

01:32:47.625 --> 01:32:51.463
Shake that booty, shake, shake
that booty. Yeah, yeah.

01:32:51.495 --> 01:32:53.230
Tenacity!

01:32:53.263 --> 01:32:54.732
And Balls.

01:32:54.765 --> 01:32:56.601
And accurate calculations...

01:32:56.634 --> 01:32:58.470
The girls!

01:32:58.503 --> 01:33:01.039
Another secret to a
successful business?

01:33:02.272 --> 01:33:04.541
<i>Easy-Corn, BanoNut,
Corn-a-Macabre.</i>

01:33:04.575 --> 01:33:05.108
Gag!

01:33:05.142 --> 01:33:06.411
The threat of violence.

01:33:06.443 --> 01:33:08.345
<i>Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa!</i>

01:33:08.379 --> 01:33:10.081
Running a business takes
a lot of things,

01:33:10.113 --> 01:33:13.117
but principally... honesty.

01:33:13.151 --> 01:33:14.019
Self confidence.

01:33:14.052 --> 01:33:14.553
Trust.

01:33:14.585 --> 01:33:16.487
How about the guns?

01:33:16.521 --> 01:33:22.360
probably... me!

01:33:22.393 --> 01:33:23.762
Tori... I swear to God...
she digs me!

01:33:23.795 --> 01:33:26.364
Wait, what was the question?

01:33:26.397 --> 01:33:28.433
You know my answer.
it starts with a "B"...

01:33:28.465 --> 01:33:31.469
Oooh... Dedication, probably.

01:33:33.437 --> 01:33:34.772
What is that?

01:33:34.805 --> 01:33:37.642
Martin wants to answer the
questions too!

01:33:37.674 --> 01:33:38.543
Focus!

01:33:38.576 --> 01:33:39.644
And guts!

01:33:39.677 --> 01:33:41.780
And it rhymes with "newbies"

01:33:41.812 --> 01:33:45.115
It's all about the Benjamins,
baby!

01:33:45.148 --> 01:33:47.785
As stated in my class, fifty
percent of small businesses

01:33:47.818 --> 01:33:49.653
fail on their first year.

01:33:49.687 --> 01:33:51.790
