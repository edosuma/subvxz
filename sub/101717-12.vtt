Reddington.

that she was right all along.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.488
whatever I can do
to make things easier,
you...

13:08.621 --> 13:10.824
I appreciate
your concern,

13:10.958 --> 13:13.260
but I have a feeling
when you hear
why it happened,

13:13.393 --> 13:15.462
sympathy may not be
the first emotion
that comes to mind.

13:15.595 --> 13:16.830
Oh.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.465
It's not my first rodeo,
partner.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.400
You've been
hiding something.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.569
I've known for a while.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.237
Something big.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.139
The real reason Agent Keen
went out on her own.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.807
She saw Reddington
kill her mother.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.042
That's reason enough.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.510
But that's
half the story.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.146
And to tell it,
we have to go back
over 30 years,

13:33.280 --> 13:35.883
to the fall
of the Soviet Union.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.086
Around that time,
a file was stolen
from Soviet intelligence.

13:39.219 --> 13:42.655
A blackmail file consisting
of 13 packets of data.

13:42.789 --> 13:45.225

on rival governments,

13:45.358 --> 13:47.660

people and corporations.

13:47.794 --> 13:48.795
Who stole it?

13:48.929 --> 13:51.264
An unidentified
Russian operative.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.800
Thirteen packets.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.103
So, after the theft,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.038
the Russians began
calling him N-13.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.907
The stolen file

14:00.040 --> 14:02.609
is the Sikorsky Archive.

14:02.742 --> 14:05.212
(SIGHS) I'm gonna need
a scratch pad.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.614
That's where
Neville Townsend
comes in.

14:07.747 --> 14:11.384
He was one of the powerful
people named in the Archive.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.054
As a result,
his family was killed.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.788
And he put a bounty
on the head of the woman

14:16.823 --> 14:17.991
he thought
was responsible.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.626
Katarina Rostova.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.361
Exactly.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.297

ran for 30 years,

14:24.431 --> 14:27.234
all the while insisting
that she was framed.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.305

Please don't say
Reddington.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.309
That's what
Agent Keen believes.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.679
Her mother found
some kind of proof,

14:39.812 --> 14:41.714
but Reddington killed her
before she could release it.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.683
Keen believes
he's a Russian spy,

14:43.816 --> 14:47.220
a plant sent to infiltrate
our intelligence agencies

14:47.354 --> 14:48.821
and to execute
some kind of endgame.

14:48.956 --> 14:49.889

we arrested today,

14:56.529 --> 14:58.365

call him Rakitin.

He's feeding intel to N-13.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.607
Clearly, he works with
or for Reddington.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.942

15:10.377 --> 15:12.845
You're saying that our
confidential informant,

15:12.980 --> 15:16.183
the man we officially
gave blanket immunity,

15:16.316 --> 15:18.551
is actually a Russian
sleeper agent?

15:20.153 --> 15:21.421
Quite possibly.

hear the recording.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.130
I need to talk to her.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.231
That point
was conveyed.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.000
She gave me
clear instructions.

15:33.133 --> 15:33.933
She didn't trust me?

15:34.067 --> 15:36.103
She does. I don't.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.637
I told her to
ignore you completely.

the number or not?

in that very chair.

I'm doing the math,

16:09.469 --> 16:11.938
and I just can't
make sense of it.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.740
Add to that
the attempted murder
of a federal agent,

16:13.873 --> 16:16.409
at least a dozen intrusions
into government servers,

16:16.543 --> 16:18.345
the theft of
confidential

there's the treason.

I know that it wasn't
one of my people,

16:21.781 --> 16:23.950

knew of our location,

killed them.

what I did.

You didn't ask me
to kill him.

You asked me
to make him go away.

We gave him
a new identity,

you might need some

We had a dozen

with him.

39:37.443 --> 39:38.510
All in progress.

39:40.546 --> 39:42.147
All of them lost.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.415
Whose fault
is that?

(SIGHING)

40:06.071 --> 40:07.906
You've been with me
a long time.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.845
And I value our friendship
above most things.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.484
But we're nearing
the end now.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.855
And nothing is more
important than that.

40:26.558 --> 40:27.993
Than what?

40:28.126 --> 40:29.861
(OTHER LIVES' "RITUAL" PLAYS)

40:32.230 --> 40:33.231
The end.

Hey, Keen, it's me.

41:04.763 --> 41:07.799
Uh, I'm here,
but you're not.

41:07.933 --> 41:10.268
** I've been waiting
for something like this...

41:10.401 --> 41:12.904
I don't even know
if you're getting
these messages.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.305
I don't know who
I'm talking to, or...

41:14.439 --> 41:15.641

41:15.774 --> 41:17.108
** Creatures of ritual...

41:17.242 --> 41:19.177
...it's probably best
you didn't show.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.445
The thing is,
I don't have good news.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.581
Look, Rakitin's dead.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.617
I don't know how,
but someone got to him.
Probably Reddington.

The ME,
we don't have word
from his office, but...

41:30.756 --> 41:31.957
It seems like
he was poisoned.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.092
Cooper's losing his mind.

** We've been waiting...

it was over this time.
