WEBVTT

00:02.799 --> 00:05.334
Why did McCarthy
single out the new agent?

00:06.936 --> 00:09.004
He has the scar.

00:09.038 --> 00:11.406
Losing you was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

00:13.343 --> 00:14.510
I know what you are.

00:14.544 --> 00:15.677
Emme, I'm still the same person.

00:16.713 --> 00:17.946
You're not a person.

00:17.981 --> 00:19.281
You're launching a nuclear attack on us.

00:19.315 --> 00:21.350
We're not planning an attack.

00:21.384 --> 00:22.684
We're trying to leave earth.

00:22.719 --> 00:23.752
I'll tell you where the launch is.

00:23.786 --> 00:25.087
In exchange, I get immunity.

00:25.121 --> 00:26.054
This is a kill mission.

00:27.423 --> 00:28.690
All Hunters are to be shot on sight.

00:28.725 --> 00:29.758
We drove straight from the hotel,

00:29.792 --> 00:31.026
got here as fast as we could.

00:31.060 --> 00:33.328
He should be healing,
I don't understand.

00:33.363 --> 00:34.463
There are traitors everywhere.

00:34.497 --> 00:36.164
Regan is inside.

00:36.199 --> 00:37.799
Agent Regan can't be trusted.

00:37.834 --> 00:39.167
She's my agent, not yours.

00:40.403 --> 00:42.337
You are no longer in command here.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.474
How'd you know?

00:45.508 --> 00:47.342
I suspected Finnerman
when the bomb went off.

00:47.377 --> 00:49.605
I knew for certain the
minute she sent me here.

00:49.774 --> 00:51.342
Briggs betrayed me.

00:51.499 --> 00:53.615
I'm sorry, Ruth.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

02:00.617 --> 02:01.583
Jackson.

02:01.618 --> 02:03.585
- It's me.
- Regan.

02:03.620 --> 02:04.886
Are you all right?

02:04.921 --> 02:05.921
I'm alive, at least.

02:05.955 --> 02:07.255
We have McCarthy.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.390
McCarthy?

02:09.425 --> 02:10.792
He came to us.

02:10.827 --> 02:12.527
Says he'll tell you where the launch is,

02:12.562 --> 02:13.895
but only if he gets immunity.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.163
Do you believe him?

02:18.434 --> 02:20.268
I don't think we have a choice.

02:20.303 --> 02:22.270
He says the launch is in 48 hours.

02:22.305 --> 02:24.640
- All right, bring him in.
- To ETU?

02:24.674 --> 02:26.808
- What about Finnerman?
- Don't worry about Finnerman.

02:26.843 --> 02:28.243
She tried to have me killed.

02:28.277 --> 02:29.978
Flynn went AWOL with me.

02:30.013 --> 02:31.780
- It's safe, I'll explain...
- What? No!

02:31.814 --> 02:32.814
I'll explain later when you get here.

02:32.849 --> 02:34.049
What's wrong?

02:34.083 --> 02:35.217
Are you all right?

02:35.251 --> 02:36.251
It's been a long night.

02:36.285 --> 02:39.121
Just bring McCarthy in.

02:39.155 --> 02:41.223
We need to stop this launch.

03:25.802 --> 03:28.270
Mankind dreams of leaving
their home planet.

03:28.304 --> 03:31.273
They build machines to take them.

03:31.307 --> 03:32.987
They know not how these
ambitions will end.

03:33.009 --> 03:35.310
How many Hunters have arrived?

03:35.344 --> 03:36.778
Lots of families.

03:36.813 --> 03:38.013
Children.

03:38.047 --> 03:39.581
They're gathered in the hangar.

03:39.615 --> 03:41.455
Liana's sending out a message
to any stragglers

03:41.484 --> 03:42.651
using the old system.

03:42.685 --> 03:44.786
We purge in two days.

03:44.821 --> 03:45.821
I must go to them.

03:45.855 --> 03:46.847
Musa, no.

03:46.849 --> 03:48.890
It's not good for them to
see you in this condition.

03:48.925 --> 03:50.525
I'll only worry them.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.194
You need to take your medication.

03:52.228 --> 03:53.829
Enough.

03:53.863 --> 03:55.297
Get that away from me.

03:55.331 --> 03:56.965
I should be healed by now.

03:58.701 --> 04:01.169
They are amongst us.

04:01.204 --> 04:02.871
Who are?

04:02.905 --> 04:04.506
The Exalted, the traitors.

04:06.509 --> 04:08.643
I killed as many as I could find.

04:08.678 --> 04:11.246
But some must have survived.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.848
You killed other Hunters?

04:12.882 --> 04:17.853
They must be stopped before
this retched flesh takes me.

04:17.887 --> 04:19.688
You need to rest, Musa.

04:21.357 --> 04:25.460
They are... inside.

04:27.029 --> 04:28.497
I must regain my strength.

04:32.235 --> 04:34.236
Take me to my Feelers.

04:41.611 --> 04:43.245
I am weak.

04:43.279 --> 04:46.381
I must feed.

05:35.278 --> 05:38.959

05:51.514 --> 05:53.415
The prodigal Hunter returns.

05:53.449 --> 05:57.419
Truss, long time no see.

05:57.453 --> 05:59.821
You're looking...

05:59.856 --> 06:01.756
not so good.

06:05.194 --> 06:07.195
Upstairs, training room.

06:07.230 --> 06:10.665
Lionel came to us, he is our guest.

06:10.700 --> 06:13.835
We will treat him with respect.

06:19.308 --> 06:21.610
I'm sorry about what
happened in the hotel.

06:24.847 --> 06:27.215
I tried to stop it.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.950
So you squared it with Finnerman?

06:30.253 --> 06:34.456
There is something you ought to see.

06:45.001 --> 06:46.902
No shit.

06:46.936 --> 06:48.036
It wasn't us.

06:48.070 --> 06:49.804
I know.

06:51.874 --> 06:53.742
Hunters got to her.

06:53.776 --> 06:55.210
Local P.D. found the body dumped

06:55.244 --> 06:56.878
a few miles from here an hour ago.

06:56.913 --> 07:00.548
They used the syringe,
tissue extraction.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.017
It's a warning.

07:02.051 --> 07:04.719
They can get to any of us any time.

07:04.754 --> 07:06.521
She deserved it.

07:08.858 --> 07:10.926
Flynn, I want you to talk to McCarthy,

07:10.960 --> 07:12.193
get negotiations started.

07:12.228 --> 07:13.461
Yes, sir. Gladly.

07:19.201 --> 07:21.336
Nobody deserves this.

07:22.705 --> 07:25.674
She wanted to genocide
an entire species.

07:25.708 --> 07:27.776
You gonna defend her now?

07:27.810 --> 07:29.711
You disobeyed a direct order

07:29.745 --> 07:31.112
when you helped that
Hunter family escape.

07:31.147 --> 07:32.295
They were innocent.

07:32.296 --> 07:34.015
There are gonna have to be
some changes around here

07:34.050 --> 07:36.084
if I'm gonna let you back on the team.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.921
You don't get
preferential treatment anymore.

07:39.956 --> 07:43.024
Preferential treatment?

07:43.059 --> 07:44.359
Are you serious?

07:44.393 --> 07:46.895
Briggs treats me like a leper

07:46.929 --> 07:49.364
and Flynn only likes me
because I saved his life.

07:49.398 --> 07:51.533
I mean from me.

07:53.436 --> 07:54.736
You're a soldier, Regan.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.738
You do as I say when I say it,

07:56.772 --> 07:59.908
otherwise, I can no longer
consider you one of us.

07:59.942 --> 08:02.577
Human, you mean.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.214
Do we understand one another?

08:07.817 --> 08:09.417
Yes, sir.

08:15.257 --> 08:16.591
Here's the deal.

08:17.426 --> 08:19.094
If what you say is true,

08:19.128 --> 08:22.597
we need answers and we need them now.

08:22.631 --> 08:24.099
We're offering protective custody.

08:24.133 --> 08:26.601
A security detail.

08:26.635 --> 08:30.638
Your movement will be restricted,

08:30.673 --> 08:32.741
but you'll be comfortable.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.529
Hunters have our own
ways of making a pact.

08:56.365 --> 08:57.832
Get me a dagger,

08:57.867 --> 09:02.937
the blood of six rabbits,
and a gyroscope.

09:06.876 --> 09:08.643
We don't need papers, Flynn, old boy.

09:08.677 --> 09:09.878
Come on, man!

09:09.912 --> 09:12.347
Seriously?

09:12.381 --> 09:15.817
After everything we've
been through together?

09:15.851 --> 09:17.452
I trust you.

09:19.155 --> 09:21.122
Then tell me where
the launch location is.

09:21.157 --> 09:22.657
I'm not just gonna tell you where it is.

09:22.691 --> 09:23.992
I mean, where's the fun in that?

09:27.163 --> 09:29.030
I knew it.

09:29.065 --> 09:33.668
I know you're playing games with us.

09:33.702 --> 09:35.170
I'll take you to it.

09:35.204 --> 09:36.471
Field trip.

09:38.407 --> 09:40.575
All right.

09:40.609 --> 09:42.577
But if you try anything,
I'll kill you myself.

09:42.611 --> 09:43.945
Old dog, old tricks.

09:43.979 --> 09:45.480
You don't have it in you anymore.

09:46.849 --> 09:48.850
Don't make me prove it.

09:50.519 --> 09:53.188
We're already tapped into Prism,
call-mining for clicks.

09:53.222 --> 09:56.057
They can't hide an entire launch site.

09:56.092 --> 10:00.829
Then we search quadrant by
quadrant until we find them.

10:05.267 --> 10:07.502
Thought we were rid of you, Guano.

10:12.975 --> 10:14.342
Get out of my face,

10:14.376 --> 10:16.277
or you will end up like Finnerman.

10:16.312 --> 10:18.012
Finnerman?

10:18.047 --> 10:19.080
You haven't heard?

10:19.115 --> 10:21.082
Hunters bagged your cougar.

10:21.117 --> 10:23.318
Body's in the lab.

10:27.590 --> 10:30.291
Where's this supposed
spaceship supposedly going?

10:30.326 --> 10:31.993
Why, to Saturn, of course.

10:32.027 --> 10:35.029
Where the Hunter colony
ship lies in high orbit.

10:35.064 --> 10:38.133
The colony's ship
will take everyone back

10:38.167 --> 10:39.400
to the Hunter home planet

10:39.435 --> 10:42.237
and so ends Hunter-human relations.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.608
Except with me, of course.

10:46.642 --> 10:48.776
If this checks out, McCarthy,

10:48.811 --> 10:50.712
you got yourself a deal.

10:55.284 --> 10:57.218
There's just one small detail.

10:58.988 --> 11:01.756
Conventional human
technology is too slow and inefficient

11:01.790 --> 11:04.792
to travel to Saturn quickly enough,

11:04.827 --> 11:08.429
so the ship that Musa built...

11:08.464 --> 11:10.098
it's like your project Orion.

11:20.943 --> 11:22.177
Go on.

11:22.211 --> 11:24.112
Papa will explain.

11:30.386 --> 11:32.053
Jackson!

11:32.087 --> 11:34.656
I need to call the Defense
Secretary and warn him now.

11:34.690 --> 11:36.324
Jackson!

11:39.528 --> 11:41.095
What's going on?

11:41.130 --> 11:44.332
Project Orion was a
spaceflight program from the 1950s.

11:44.366 --> 11:46.467
The technology called for an...

11:47.803 --> 11:50.138
The technology called for nuclear energy

11:50.172 --> 11:51.940
to be used to launch a space ship.

11:51.974 --> 11:54.375
Like nuclear subs?

11:54.410 --> 11:55.944
No.

11:57.413 --> 12:00.181
A nuclear explosion launches the ship.

12:00.216 --> 12:02.350
Not just one nuke, dozens of them,

12:02.384 --> 12:04.152
one right after the other.

12:05.054 --> 12:06.621
The fallout...

12:06.655 --> 12:08.823
Will cover an area far greater
than the airspace

12:08.857 --> 12:10.758
cleared by Bob Brecke.

12:10.793 --> 12:12.994
It will cover the entire continent.

12:30.421 --> 12:31.713
What are you doing?

12:31.830 --> 12:33.307
I'm pulling you out of school.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.276
- You're not serious.
- I am.

12:35.344 --> 12:37.044
Close the door.

12:38.714 --> 12:42.083
You're gonna stay with
your Aunt Josie in Canada.

12:42.150 --> 12:43.884
What? No!

12:43.952 --> 12:45.920
She's like 19 and she lives
in the North Pole.

12:45.988 --> 12:47.188
She's 26.

12:47.255 --> 12:50.624
She lives in Saskatchewan
and it's just for a few days.

12:50.692 --> 12:51.892
Maybe longer.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.280
It doesn't matter, I'm not going.

12:53.295 --> 12:54.762
What is this all about?

12:54.830 --> 12:56.797
It's too dangerous to stay here anymore.

12:56.865 --> 12:59.300
- I need you far away.
- From what?

13:01.970 --> 13:04.071
Is it those scary guys at your work?

13:04.139 --> 13:05.306
Flynn, I promise,

13:05.374 --> 13:06.440
I didn't tell anyone about Abby.

13:06.508 --> 13:07.575
I know.

13:07.642 --> 13:08.909
And that's not what this is about.

13:08.977 --> 13:10.845
Emme, you're leaving.

13:10.912 --> 13:12.513
This is not up for debate.

13:12.581 --> 13:16.283
Then you're gonna have to drag me out.

13:20.122 --> 13:21.188
Abby's gone.

13:21.256 --> 13:23.724
I'm not leaving you, too.

13:31.166 --> 13:33.768
Emme...

13:33.835 --> 13:36.270
I can't do this anymore.

13:38.073 --> 13:41.675
I can't pretend to be your dad anymore.

13:44.646 --> 13:47.014
You're better off with a real family.

13:53.288 --> 13:54.688
But I love you.

13:57.492 --> 13:59.393
I love you, too.

14:09.571 --> 14:11.839
We are less than 36 hours away

14:11.907 --> 14:14.108
from a nuclear disaster.

14:14.176 --> 14:18.212
Yes, we have confirmation on the intel.

14:18.280 --> 14:22.883
Our informant says the launch
site is in northern Mexico.

14:22.951 --> 14:24.785
A Hunter sleeper agent disabled

14:24.853 --> 14:26.720
satellite response for that region.

14:26.788 --> 14:29.557
I've briefed my team,
we're deploying immediately.

14:29.624 --> 14:31.525
Roger that, yes, sir, we will.

14:34.763 --> 14:37.565
What is it?

14:37.632 --> 14:39.033
McCarthy's playing you.

14:39.101 --> 14:40.434
I know that.

14:40.502 --> 14:42.069
But he's the lesser of two evils,

14:42.137 --> 14:43.537
so we're playing along.

14:43.605 --> 14:46.540
Even if he's leading us into a trap?

14:46.608 --> 14:49.543
You have a problem following my orders?

14:51.179 --> 14:53.881
Dr. James thinks that
Finnerman might have already been dead

14:53.949 --> 14:57.518
when the Hunters took a tissue sample.

14:57.586 --> 15:01.122
All the other victims were still
alive during the extraction.

15:01.189 --> 15:05.459
So it's a pity that we can't
ask Finnerman what really happened.

15:05.527 --> 15:07.294
You had me call her to the farmhouse

15:07.362 --> 15:10.030
and now she's dead.

15:10.098 --> 15:13.634
Yeah, well, Ruth made a lot of enemies.

15:13.702 --> 15:17.037
But only one took her out.

15:17.105 --> 15:19.940
We're moving out in 30.

15:20.008 --> 15:21.275
Be ready.

15:21.343 --> 15:24.078
Dismissed.

15:36.324 --> 15:38.192
So why are you ratting out on Musa now?

15:38.260 --> 15:40.494
He's leaving. It's now or never.

15:40.562 --> 15:42.296
Then why bother?

15:42.364 --> 15:44.765
I did Musa's dirty work, you know?

15:44.833 --> 15:46.500
Killed and terrorized
while he Elon Musk'd it

15:46.568 --> 15:48.135
and played philosopher king.

15:48.203 --> 15:50.838
Revenge. How primitive.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.507
Yes.

15:53.575 --> 15:54.909
We understand each other.

15:54.976 --> 15:56.443
Not even close.

15:56.511 --> 15:58.679
Oh, but we do.

15:58.747 --> 16:00.447
Musa abandoned me.

16:00.515 --> 16:02.616
Liana abandoned you.

16:02.684 --> 16:04.251
Musa abandoned your father.

16:04.319 --> 16:05.486
Circle of strife.

16:05.954 --> 16:07.354
Come on.

16:07.422 --> 16:10.991
You're Simba and Mommy is big bad Scar.

16:11.059 --> 16:12.760
Hakuna fu... matata!

16:14.496 --> 16:15.429
Ooh.

16:15.497 --> 16:18.332
Hello, kitten.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.768
Grr.

16:20.835 --> 16:22.277
Feisty.

16:23.471 --> 16:24.705
Why don't you just go back
to your home planet

16:24.773 --> 16:26.207
and save us all a lot of grief?

16:26.274 --> 16:28.275
To be honest with you,
I kinda like it here.

16:28.343 --> 16:31.612
You know what I'm talking
about, Agent Alison Regan.

16:32.614 --> 16:34.348
Oh, look who's here.

16:34.416 --> 16:38.552
Ha! It's the same with Abby.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.888
I tried for years to
get her out from her cover,

16:40.956 --> 16:42.690
your sham of a marriage.

16:42.757 --> 16:47.962
But she kept making excuses to stay.

16:48.830 --> 16:50.497
Star-crossed lovers.

16:50.565 --> 16:51.966
Literally.

16:53.301 --> 16:55.769
All she really wants is to be with you.

17:13.154 --> 17:15.955
Soon, we shall leave
this cursed planet, Liana.

17:17.692 --> 17:21.561
All our hard work
finally coming to fruition.

17:22.731 --> 17:24.164
But I'm worried about you.

17:24.232 --> 17:25.699
Your health.

17:25.767 --> 17:28.502
Abby said she took you
to the Feelers to feed,

17:28.569 --> 17:30.170
but you still look unwell.

17:31.339 --> 17:33.841
Do you need another injection?

17:33.908 --> 17:37.878
Perhaps I look unwell
because I feel under threat.

17:42.384 --> 17:44.418
Am I under threat?

17:44.486 --> 17:48.522
The humans have proved more
resilient than we thought.

17:48.590 --> 17:50.858
No threats from within?

17:50.925 --> 17:54.028
They're all devoted,
Brother Number Four.

17:56.131 --> 17:58.932
And you? Who are you devoted to?

18:02.203 --> 18:03.203
My own kind.

18:29.153 --> 18:31.024
Musa?

18:33.127 --> 18:35.195
Liana?

18:43.537 --> 18:44.771
Get away from him!

18:44.805 --> 18:45.939
Abby, no!

18:45.973 --> 18:47.240
He is no danger!

18:48.476 --> 18:50.710
Liana is trying to kill me. What?

18:50.745 --> 18:51.878
No, that isn't true.

18:51.912 --> 18:53.279
She's been taking care of you.

18:53.314 --> 18:54.447
I thought so, too.

18:54.482 --> 18:56.583
But look at my body.

18:56.617 --> 18:58.218
It is getting worse.

18:58.252 --> 19:00.587
The medicine she gave me.

19:00.621 --> 19:02.122
Poison.

19:02.156 --> 19:04.891
No, that can't be.

19:04.925 --> 19:06.793
You're not well, Brother.

19:06.827 --> 19:09.562
She murdered one of my loyal feelers.

19:10.398 --> 19:12.265
Why would she do that?

19:12.299 --> 19:15.135
She is Exalted.

19:15.169 --> 19:17.170
We must stop her.

19:22.309 --> 19:24.444
Finnerman was right about the Hunters,

19:24.478 --> 19:26.546
all that talk about innocence.

19:27.982 --> 19:29.315
A whole lot of nothing.

19:29.350 --> 19:32.819
Bullshit.

19:32.853 --> 19:37.457
So, everything okay with you and Regan?

19:37.491 --> 19:39.259
That's none of your business.

19:39.293 --> 19:42.295
She was pretty rattled that
Finnerman turned on her.

19:42.329 --> 19:43.930
Can't blame her.

19:43.964 --> 19:48.301
Quite the betrayal.

19:48.335 --> 19:52.572
We've all had our share.

19:52.606 --> 19:56.443
Abby was telling the
truth about the Purge.

19:56.477 --> 19:59.779
Apparently.

19:59.814 --> 20:01.147
But she didn't say shit about

20:01.182 --> 20:03.516
the launch frying millions of humans.

20:03.551 --> 20:08.221
McCarthy said the only
Hunters who knew were Musa and Liana.

20:08.255 --> 20:09.756
Inner circle.

20:09.790 --> 20:14.360
Yeah, well, McCarthy's
not exactly forthcoming.

20:14.395 --> 20:18.264
If Abby knew or not,

20:18.299 --> 20:20.166
doesn't change the mission.

20:22.736 --> 20:27.974
So you are prepared to
stop her if it comes to that.

20:28.008 --> 20:30.410
I wouldn't be
sitting here if I wasn't sir.

20:32.246 --> 20:34.414
You get Emme to someplace safe?

20:36.283 --> 20:38.451
Safe enough.

20:39.753 --> 20:41.087
You look excited.

20:42.823 --> 20:44.090
To see your mom again.

20:45.092 --> 20:46.459
Thrilled.

20:46.494 --> 20:47.827
Your mom's strong.

20:47.862 --> 20:49.028
Decisive.

20:49.063 --> 20:50.697
You should look up to her.

20:50.731 --> 20:52.365
Young women need positive role models.

20:52.399 --> 20:54.934
My mom is weak. Musa's pawn.

20:54.969 --> 20:56.669
That's where you're wrong.

20:56.704 --> 20:59.572
Everything Liana's done has been
for the good of her kind.

20:59.607 --> 21:02.709
Of our kind.

21:02.743 --> 21:07.580
You're not one of
them, and you never will be.

21:07.615 --> 21:10.383
But, of course, you already knew that.

21:16.624 --> 21:20.527
Knock that lizard shit off,
or I'm putting your gag on.

21:29.270 --> 21:30.470
We're here.

21:49.924 --> 21:52.125
He's screwing with us.

21:52.159 --> 21:54.127
Give him a minute.

21:54.161 --> 21:56.396
We don't have a minute.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.400
That way.

22:02.336 --> 22:03.703
Carroll, check it out.

22:03.737 --> 22:04.704
Safe for now.

22:04.738 --> 22:07.240
Hunters only fly at night.

22:07.274 --> 22:08.741
Regan.

22:08.776 --> 22:10.476
Put the restraints back on it.

22:10.511 --> 22:13.079
Restraints? I gotta do restraints?

22:13.113 --> 22:15.648
If McCarthy's lying to us,
we should take him out for good.

22:15.683 --> 22:16.983
Hell, even if he's telling the truth,

22:17.017 --> 22:18.051
we should take him out.

22:18.085 --> 22:19.619
I heard that.

22:19.653 --> 22:21.120
Bat-eared freak.

22:21.155 --> 22:22.622
Not very nice.

22:23.991 --> 22:25.325
I made a deal.

22:25.359 --> 22:26.659
McCarthy keeps his
end up, I'll keep up mine.

22:26.694 --> 22:28.461
He's a risk.

22:28.495 --> 22:31.130
The longer he remains alive,
the more we're all in danger.

22:31.165 --> 22:34.233
The decision's been made.

22:51.952 --> 22:53.586
Oh, shit.

22:53.621 --> 22:57.323
Carroll, what do you see?

22:57.358 --> 22:59.325
- The ship.
- Do a head count,

22:59.360 --> 23:00.326
get back here.

23:00.361 --> 23:01.427
Roger that.

23:01.462 --> 23:03.596
And you doubted me.

23:03.631 --> 23:05.164
Oh, ye of little faith.

23:05.199 --> 23:07.166
I'm a man of my word,

23:07.201 --> 23:09.602
just like you are, Elder Jackson.

23:15.409 --> 23:19.045
Why did you come to me
with this information?

23:19.079 --> 23:20.179
Why me?

23:22.082 --> 23:24.417
I've spent over 30 years
studying humans,

23:24.451 --> 23:26.152
the good, the bad, the ugly.

23:27.421 --> 23:29.022
I've seen 'em all.

23:29.056 --> 23:31.858
The difference between
your kind and ours

23:31.892 --> 23:35.294
is that humans aspire to
something beyond primal hungers.

23:35.329 --> 23:36.729
In that regard,

23:36.764 --> 23:38.898
you're the humanest human I've ever met.

23:38.932 --> 23:42.969
No. I am hardly perfect.

23:43.003 --> 23:45.738
Of course not.

23:45.773 --> 23:48.541
You're a sinner, just like I am.

23:48.575 --> 23:50.243
This is our redemption, Truss.

23:50.277 --> 23:55.648
Musa's blood spills and together,
we save mankind.

23:55.683 --> 23:57.950
Or at least a few million Mexicans.

23:59.386 --> 24:00.420
Thank you.

24:00.454 --> 24:02.155
De nada.

24:03.257 --> 24:04.991
We may need more intel.

24:05.025 --> 24:08.828
Keep Mr. McCarthy in the vehicle
until after the raid is over.

24:11.799 --> 24:14.701
Stay gold, Ponyboy.

24:21.408 --> 24:22.775
Ground to control.

24:22.810 --> 24:24.090
Cargo is currently being loaded.

24:25.045 --> 24:26.212
Copy, ground.

24:26.246 --> 24:28.014
Pre-flight alignment complete.

24:28.048 --> 24:29.682
Launch window has been determined.

24:29.717 --> 24:31.050
14 hours and counting.

24:39.827 --> 24:40.927
Copy, control.

24:40.961 --> 24:42.061
14 hours and counting.

24:53.841 --> 24:55.441
All right, listen up.

24:55.476 --> 24:58.044
The Mexican government is preparing
an evacuation plan

24:58.078 --> 24:59.545
for the surrounding area.

24:59.580 --> 25:01.147
We strike,

25:01.181 --> 25:02.982
once civilian contingencies are in place

25:03.016 --> 25:04.751
approximately 0300 now.

25:04.785 --> 25:08.087
Our two auxiliary units
will be providing backup support.

25:08.122 --> 25:10.156
Once that emergency signal goes out,

25:10.190 --> 25:11.891
we'll have to move fast.

25:11.925 --> 25:14.494
If the Hunters get word,
they'll know we're coming.

25:14.528 --> 25:16.763
So Carroll, Regan,

25:16.797 --> 25:19.599
you'll take team one
into the main compound,

25:19.633 --> 25:22.101
draw as many Hunters as possible
away from the ship.

25:22.136 --> 25:25.938
Briggs, you will wait for
them to confirm the path is clear

25:25.973 --> 25:28.941
then take team two to
the ship, disable the launch.

25:31.779 --> 25:33.346
Potassium iodide.

25:33.380 --> 25:37.650
This will give you some
protection from the radiation.

25:43.524 --> 25:45.291
God willing, we won't need it.

26:02.910 --> 26:07.246
You, ethnic sidekick with an attitude.

26:07.281 --> 26:09.382
You got a snappy comment
or you here just to look cute?

26:09.416 --> 26:11.317
You think you're so smart?

26:12.820 --> 26:15.621
You know what I call you?

26:15.656 --> 26:16.789
Takeout.

26:17.891 --> 26:19.192
You're not going anywhere.

26:19.226 --> 26:20.827
I got what I wanted.

26:20.861 --> 26:23.629
Musa and his
followers captured by the humans

26:23.664 --> 26:26.299
and me into the wind
before you fools even...

27:07.840 --> 27:09.040
Regan.

27:09.074 --> 27:10.441
The evacuation is underway.

27:10.476 --> 27:12.010
Where are we with the breach?

27:12.044 --> 27:13.578
We're approaching the hangars.

27:13.612 --> 27:15.580
There's guards posted at the perimeter.

27:18.150 --> 27:21.352
Sir, McCarthy's down.

27:21.387 --> 27:24.288
Down? Down how?

27:24.323 --> 27:25.957
Sonic blast.

27:25.991 --> 27:27.859
Briggs was the last one with him.

27:34.166 --> 27:36.034
It had to be done.

27:36.068 --> 27:38.770
You disobeyed a direct order.

27:38.804 --> 27:40.772
The order was bullshit.

27:42.808 --> 27:46.778
Someone around here needs
to start doing the right thing,

27:46.812 --> 27:49.180
putting these freaks down
like the monsters they are.

27:49.214 --> 27:51.749
And if you don't have
the balls for that,

27:51.784 --> 27:52.884
I'm happy to handle it.

27:52.918 --> 27:54.318
You're way out of line.

27:54.353 --> 27:57.121
No, I know what you did to Finnerman.

27:57.156 --> 28:00.258
You want me to keep my mouth shut.

28:00.292 --> 28:06.264
So from now on, in this unit,
I make my own decisions.

28:06.298 --> 28:08.433
You can't prove who killed Finnerman.

28:08.467 --> 28:10.168
I don't have to.

28:10.202 --> 28:13.805
And if you come after me,
I'll bury you first.

28:15.774 --> 28:19.777
We got a launch to stop, sir.

28:32.491 --> 28:33.991
McCarthy was shot on my command.

28:34.026 --> 28:35.827
Clean it up.

28:35.861 --> 28:37.862
Yes, sir, right away,

28:37.896 --> 28:39.797
Deploy your team, Agent.

28:39.832 --> 28:42.066
Whatever you say, Commander.

28:45.804 --> 28:47.839
Auto launch sequence initiated.

28:47.873 --> 28:49.907
T-minus 15 minutes to fuel cell ignition.

29:01.353 --> 29:02.453
Hello?

29:04.656 --> 29:06.991
Everyone's boarded the ship.

29:11.964 --> 29:14.031
What are you doing out here?

29:23.408 --> 29:24.809
Jackson, we're inside the hangars,

29:24.843 --> 29:26.444
dividing up the search.

29:30.883 --> 29:33.050
Hold up. You're bleeding.

29:33.085 --> 29:34.886
Are you okay?

29:34.920 --> 29:36.921
Our security's being breached.

29:36.955 --> 29:38.422
We're being raided.

29:38.457 --> 29:40.691
Move that truck now!

29:40.726 --> 29:42.695
Make sure all the travelers
are out of the hangar

29:42.696 --> 29:43.594
and inside the ship.

29:43.629 --> 29:46.864
Then bring Musa to join them.

29:46.899 --> 29:48.779
When you did the head count,
did you see my mom?

29:48.801 --> 29:51.202
Abby, too.

29:51.236 --> 29:52.904
You heard Jackson's orders.

29:52.938 --> 29:54.939
Clear Brigg's path to the ship.

29:54.973 --> 29:56.474
Disable the warheads.

29:58.443 --> 30:00.511
Kill anyone who gets in the way.

30:05.651 --> 30:06.884
Watch yourself.

30:21.934 --> 30:25.570
T-minus 13 minutes to fuel cell ignition.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.280
What are you doing?

30:42.988 --> 30:44.956
You're a traitor.

30:44.990 --> 30:47.725
You tried to kill Musa.

30:47.759 --> 30:51.963
Musa betrayed us first.

30:51.997 --> 30:54.232
You're Exalted.

30:54.266 --> 30:55.299
The enemy.

30:55.334 --> 30:56.934
We are the true Hunters.

30:56.969 --> 31:00.404
This flesh is not an accident.

31:00.439 --> 31:03.140
It is what was always intended.

31:06.712 --> 31:09.247
He's our brother and
you tried to kill him.

31:09.281 --> 31:11.282
Musa kept the truth from you,

31:11.316 --> 31:13.451
but you remain his loyal soldier.

31:13.485 --> 31:17.755
Your experience with
the humans is irreplaceable.

31:17.789 --> 31:21.259
You understand love,
how to use it against them?

31:21.293 --> 31:23.194
T-minus 12 minutes to fuel cell ignition.

31:23.228 --> 31:25.029
I won't help you.

31:25.063 --> 31:27.632
Never.

31:27.666 --> 31:28.799
You're pathetic.

31:32.070 --> 31:33.337
You think the humans want you?

31:33.372 --> 31:35.806
That Carroll loves you?

31:35.841 --> 31:37.808
You were a warrior once!

31:37.843 --> 31:38.943
I still am.

31:46.385 --> 31:48.386
Carroll, we're almost there.

31:48.420 --> 31:50.321
Copy that, hangars are clear.

31:52.491 --> 31:53.858
Wait, I hear something.

32:05.537 --> 32:08.472
T-minus 11 minutes to fuel cell ignition.

32:08.507 --> 32:10.341
Flynn Carroll.

32:10.375 --> 32:11.475
You have come.

32:12.377 --> 32:15.413
I knew you would.

32:15.447 --> 32:18.349
Uh-uh. You keep that thing back.

32:19.384 --> 32:20.651
I won't let it hurt you.

32:20.686 --> 32:22.887
Jackson, I found Musa.

32:22.921 --> 32:23.988
Copy that.

32:24.022 --> 32:25.856
Detain him if you can.

32:25.891 --> 32:28.392
I only want to go to my ship.

32:28.427 --> 32:30.361
You can protect me.

32:30.395 --> 32:32.063
One more move, I'll shoot.

32:32.097 --> 32:33.097
Your weapons don't work on me.

32:33.131 --> 32:34.432
Bullshit.

32:34.466 --> 32:36.033
You're just like the rest of them.

32:36.068 --> 32:37.902
I am not and neither are you.

32:37.936 --> 32:41.372
You are not like the other humans.

32:41.406 --> 32:45.876
No one on earth has ever
survived the Great Hunt.

32:45.911 --> 32:47.445
Except for you.

32:47.479 --> 32:49.547
It is the sign.

32:49.581 --> 32:52.216
You are the one who can stop my enemies.

32:52.250 --> 32:54.251
They are here.

32:54.286 --> 32:55.586
Hunters.

32:55.620 --> 32:57.254
The ones who went astray.

33:13.138 --> 33:15.039
Musa, where are you?

33:26.618 --> 33:29.587
T-minus ten minutes to 
fuel cell ignition.

34:36.561 --> 34:39.030
T-minus nine minutes
to fuel cell ignition.

34:59.017 --> 35:02.219
Jackson, the Hunters have
all boarded the ship.

35:02.254 --> 35:04.622
We're heading for the control room.

35:04.656 --> 35:06.557
What do your enemies want?

35:06.591 --> 35:07.992
Everything.

35:08.026 --> 35:10.661
They will devour
your planet like locusts,

35:10.696 --> 35:13.664
but we can stop them.

35:13.699 --> 35:15.099
It is your fate.

35:16.501 --> 35:19.570
I sent an angel from above
to watch over you.

35:20.472 --> 35:21.572
Abby.

35:21.606 --> 35:22.606
Yes.

35:22.641 --> 35:24.275
So you can save my kind.

35:24.309 --> 35:27.244
You've been shitting on my life

35:27.279 --> 35:29.046
for the past six years,

35:29.081 --> 35:33.050
bombing, killing.

35:33.085 --> 35:34.618
It had to be done.

35:34.653 --> 35:36.087
So does this.

35:37.889 --> 35:40.591
We... are... going home!

36:11.223 --> 36:15.459
T-minus eight minutes
to fuel cell ignition.

36:15.494 --> 36:18.396
Jackson, we've reached the control room.

36:18.430 --> 36:21.732
The launch has been disabled,
but we've got a bigger problem.

36:21.767 --> 36:23.000
The ship's grounded,

36:23.034 --> 36:24.568
but the nukes are still set to blow.

36:24.603 --> 36:26.337
The sequence for detonation
has already started.

36:27.372 --> 36:28.539
I can hear the module mechanics.

36:28.573 --> 36:30.040
It's already underway.

36:30.075 --> 36:33.210
We've got seven minutes until boom town.

36:33.245 --> 36:35.579
They'll go off on the
ground, not in the air.

36:35.614 --> 36:37.314
Smaller radius.

36:37.349 --> 36:39.550
Two kilotons is still
gonna leave a hell of a crater.

36:39.584 --> 36:41.218
We need to get out of here.

36:41.253 --> 36:42.353
And the Hunters?

36:42.387 --> 36:43.988
Fail alarms are going off.

36:44.022 --> 36:45.823
The Hunters inside are trapped
and they know it.

36:45.857 --> 36:47.425
They'll all die in there. Get 'em out.

36:47.459 --> 36:49.026
Doors are sealed shut,

36:49.060 --> 36:50.895
we stop to break 'em out
and we're not gonna make it.

36:50.929 --> 36:52.930
T-minus seven minutes
to fuel cell ignition.

36:52.964 --> 36:54.331
Abandon the mission.

36:54.366 --> 36:55.733
Evacuate now.

36:55.767 --> 36:56.887
We can't outrun the fallout.

36:56.902 --> 36:58.569
No, but we can survive it.

36:58.603 --> 37:01.906
Gear up and get your team
out as quickly as you can.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.908
My arm, it's burning!

37:03.942 --> 37:05.209
It's okay.

37:05.243 --> 37:07.812
It's gonna be okay.

37:07.846 --> 37:09.213
Carroll, Regan?

37:09.247 --> 37:11.382
The launch has been sabotaged,

37:11.416 --> 37:13.250
but the nukes are still set to blow.

37:13.285 --> 37:15.619
Get everyone you can out
of there right now.

37:15.654 --> 37:17.254
We gotta move.

37:17.289 --> 37:19.356
The Hunters are still on board.
They're all gonna die.

37:19.391 --> 37:22.560
- Abby, there's no time!
- Please, we need to save them.

37:24.463 --> 37:26.171
Hold up, Briggs!

37:31.002 --> 37:33.904
Hey! Hey!

37:33.939 --> 37:35.172
Hey!

37:39.177 --> 37:41.512
Oh, son of a bitch.

37:43.849 --> 37:46.083
T-minus six minutes to
fuel cell ignition.

37:55.260 --> 37:57.728
It's okay, I'm here!

38:03.802 --> 38:05.803
Abby! Come on, we gotta go!

38:05.837 --> 38:08.072
Come on!

38:08.106 --> 38:10.407
- They're all gonna die!
- Yeah.

38:11.443 --> 38:12.443
Come on, it's too late!

38:12.477 --> 38:13.577
We'll die trying to save them!

38:13.612 --> 38:15.346
- Come on!
- Then I die!

38:15.380 --> 38:17.915
- Abby!
- We can't just leave them!

38:31.730 --> 38:33.597
Hey.

38:33.632 --> 38:37.101
Hands up. Step away from the truck.

38:42.374 --> 38:43.641
Mom.

38:43.675 --> 38:47.177
There you are. You found me.

38:47.212 --> 38:50.214
Musa sabotaged the launch.

38:50.248 --> 38:52.349
I tried to stop him,
but he was too strong.

38:52.384 --> 38:54.151
Regan, are you still in the compound?

38:54.185 --> 38:55.653
Why would Musa do that?

38:55.687 --> 38:59.657
He gathered us all together
to destroy us.

38:59.691 --> 39:02.059
He wasn't our Moses, he was a monster.

39:02.093 --> 39:03.727
Regan, do you copy?

39:03.762 --> 39:05.262
I have a plane a few miles away

39:05.297 --> 39:07.665
and this truck will protect
us from the blast.

39:07.699 --> 39:10.034
Evacuate now, that's an order!

39:10.068 --> 39:11.869
The humans have no respect for you.

39:11.903 --> 39:15.172
You're just a skin puppet to them.

39:15.206 --> 39:16.307
I can save you.

39:16.341 --> 39:18.642
Save us.

39:21.179 --> 39:25.583
We die here or we live together.

39:25.617 --> 39:28.185
T-minus five minutes
to fuel cell ignition.

39:33.052 --> 39:34.782
Regan, please, if you can hear me,

39:34.816 --> 39:36.917
have you found a vehicle?

39:36.951 --> 39:38.451
Are you headed to safety?

39:38.486 --> 39:40.587
Carroll! Carroll, do you read me?

39:40.621 --> 39:41.788
Copy!

39:41.823 --> 39:44.024
And Regan, any word?

39:44.058 --> 39:45.058
Nothing.

39:47.128 --> 39:50.430
Where's McCarthy's body?

40:44.352 --> 40:46.319
The president says
that the nuclear blast

40:46.354 --> 40:48.788
in Northern Mexico two weeks ago

40:48.823 --> 40:51.091
is now being confirmed
by the "Washington Post"

40:51.125 --> 40:52.993
as a failed attack by terrorists,

40:53.027 --> 40:54.661
and that the entire leadership

40:54.695 --> 40:57.797
of the organization
died in the explosion.

41:08.042 --> 41:11.811
Welcome home.
