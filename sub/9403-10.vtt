WEBVTT

00:08.102 --> 00:09.323
Whoa!

00:09.324 --> 00:11.397
No, no.
Is that...

00:11.398 --> 00:12.577
Our friend
the drug dealer.

00:12.578 --> 00:13.583
At least it used to be.

00:13.584 --> 00:15.246
No. No, no, no.
I didn't see that.

00:15.247 --> 00:16.539
I-I <i>don't</i> see that.

00:16.540 --> 00:18.671
You mean him?
There's no "him."

00:18.672 --> 00:20.239
Sure there is...
Well, what's left of him.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.210
He's right there.

00:21.211 --> 00:23.546
You can't...
Okay, he's not...

00:23.547 --> 00:25.548
You can't kill people
in a sound stage...

00:25.549 --> 00:27.050
<i>My</i> sound stage!

00:27.051 --> 00:28.465
You rented it to me.

00:28.466 --> 00:30.583
You said
it wasn't illegal!

00:30.584 --> 00:32.305
I'm not a part of this.
Julian.

00:32.305 --> 00:35.141
There's a dead guy
in my sound stage!

00:35.142 --> 00:36.767
Julian, he's not dead.
He's just...

00:36.768 --> 00:39.312
Well, I guess
he <i>could</i> be dead by now.

00:39.313 --> 00:41.778
I can't go to prison, okay?
You said it yourself.

00:41.779 --> 00:42.774
They'll <i>like</i> me there.

00:42.775 --> 00:44.150
You're not going
to prison.

00:44.151 --> 00:45.442
- I have a family, man!
- Nobody is going to prison.

00:45.443 --> 00:46.944
Will you just calm down?!

00:46.945 --> 00:51.304
Besides, we're the only two
people that know about this.

00:52.823 --> 00:54.774
Is that guy dead?

00:54.775 --> 00:57.227
Okay, <i>three</i> people know.

00:57.228 --> 00:59.278
Four, counting Haley.

00:59.279 --> 01:01.748
We're going to jail.

01:04.418 --> 01:08.338
Rise and shine!

01:08.339 --> 01:10.840
Hey, look.

01:10.841 --> 01:13.596
Front page.

01:13.597 --> 01:15.178
Not your best photo, true,

01:15.179 --> 01:17.058
but still,
front page is good, no?

01:19.132 --> 01:21.437
Before I get large cash,

01:21.438 --> 01:23.019
I have to show
in good faith

01:23.020 --> 01:25.905
that you are still alive
and somewhat well.

01:25.906 --> 01:27.306
Okay.

01:27.307 --> 01:30.321
Open your eyes,
chin up.

01:30.322 --> 01:32.698
Say "the cheese."

01:34.952 --> 01:38.496
Would you like 8x10
or wallet size?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.621
No?

01:41.622 --> 01:43.540
Nathan Scott.

01:43.541 --> 01:47.004
The rest is silence.

01:47.005 --> 01:48.256
No.

01:48.257 --> 01:49.507
Please.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.802
Not the hood.

02:00.107 --> 02:03.760
Because you say "please."

02:03.761 --> 02:05.728
Etiquette counts,
my friend.

02:12.203 --> 02:13.906
Look at this marmaduke.

02:13.907 --> 02:16.155
He... he crazy dog.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.168 --> 03:02.747
Is he dead yet?

03:02.748 --> 03:04.290
I don't think so.

03:04.291 --> 03:05.404
Check his pulse
or something.

03:05.405 --> 03:06.334
He's not dead.

03:09.296 --> 03:11.881
He's right.
He's not dead... yet.

03:11.882 --> 03:15.548
Boy, I'd sure hate
to own <i>this</i> place.

03:15.549 --> 03:17.636
Why? What's <i>that
supposed to mean?</i>

03:17.637 --> 03:20.553
Well, kidnapping,
aggravated assault.

03:20.554 --> 03:21.554
Dude...

03:21.555 --> 03:24.223
Relax.
You shut up.

03:24.224 --> 03:25.394
What are you
doing here, anyway?

03:25.395 --> 03:26.776
Well, I came to help,

03:26.777 --> 03:29.732
but Chris Keller's too pretty
to go to prison.

03:29.733 --> 03:31.025
Yeah, that's what <i>i</i> said.

03:31.026 --> 03:32.360
You said Chris Keller
was pretty?

03:32.361 --> 03:34.654
Nobody's going to prison.

03:34.655 --> 03:36.655
How'd you know
to find us here?

03:36.656 --> 03:38.888
Haley...
I followed her last night.

03:38.889 --> 03:41.243
By the way,
she was looking super fine.

03:41.244 --> 03:42.375
Why?
I don't know.

03:42.376 --> 03:43.543
She had on
this little miniskirt

03:43.544 --> 03:44.538
and these boots.

03:44.539 --> 03:45.956
Why did you follow her?

03:45.957 --> 03:48.564
Oh. I was worried about her
and about Nate.

03:48.565 --> 03:51.128
So I saw you guys
drag the dead body in here.

03:51.129 --> 03:52.462
He's not dead.
Don't say "dead."

03:52.463 --> 03:53.619
I followed her home,

03:53.620 --> 03:55.672
and I watched her cry
in her car.

03:55.673 --> 03:58.007
I assume this guy knows
where Nate is.

03:58.008 --> 03:59.678
Did he tell you?
He told me.

03:59.679 --> 04:00.721
And you're gonna
bring him home?

04:00.722 --> 04:02.473
That's right.
Then I want to help.

04:02.474 --> 04:03.474
Good.

04:03.475 --> 04:06.185
Damn!

04:06.186 --> 04:08.017
Chris Keller was kind of hoping
you'd say no,

04:08.018 --> 04:08.938
like when you offer
to pick up a check.

04:08.939 --> 04:10.356
I was just
being courteous.

04:10.357 --> 04:12.817
You guys understand
what we're doing here, right,

04:12.818 --> 04:15.074
with the dead body in the trunk
and the weapons in the bag?

04:15.075 --> 04:16.195
You realize
this is real, yes?

04:16.196 --> 04:17.642
Yes.

04:17.644 --> 04:19.031
Well, I think
we should go to the cops.

04:19.031 --> 04:20.363
No.

04:20.363 --> 04:21.814
Why not?

04:21.815 --> 04:23.533
'Cause I don't trust them.

04:23.534 --> 04:24.995
Why?

04:26.683 --> 04:29.088
I went there last night...

04:29.089 --> 04:31.824
The warehouse
underneath the interstate.

04:31.825 --> 04:33.170
I studied the guards,

04:33.171 --> 04:36.662
their shift patterns,
entrances, exits.

04:36.663 --> 04:38.384
A patrol car came and left.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.804
You think the cops
are involved?

04:41.805 --> 04:44.020
I don't know.

04:44.021 --> 04:46.475
All I know is, Nathan's
in there and he's alive.

04:46.476 --> 04:48.519
Are you sure...
That he's alive, I mean?

04:48.520 --> 04:54.113
First, why would they guard
the place if he wasn't?

04:54.114 --> 04:56.399
Second, he's my son.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.154
He's alive.

04:59.737 --> 05:01.156
Look, you're right.

05:01.157 --> 05:02.741
This is real.

05:02.742 --> 05:04.743
It's not
gonna be pretty.

05:04.744 --> 05:08.077
These guys are professionals.
There's a half dozen or so.

05:08.078 --> 05:10.362
They're holding Nathan...

05:10.363 --> 05:14.751
My son, your friend,
Haley's husband.

05:14.752 --> 05:17.253
I'm going back there
tonight,

05:17.254 --> 05:19.972
and I'm not leaving
without him.

05:19.973 --> 05:21.385
I need some help.

05:24.031 --> 05:24.972
I'll help you.

05:27.848 --> 05:29.226
It's Nathan.

05:29.227 --> 05:31.684
What about you,
peacock?

05:31.685 --> 05:33.523
C-Chris Keller
needs a little more time!

05:33.524 --> 05:34.524
We don't have time.

05:36.273 --> 05:37.490
Okay, fine, I'll help,

05:37.491 --> 05:39.108
but Chris Keller
wants to go on record

05:39.109 --> 05:40.947
as saying Chris Keller
doesn't like this.

05:47.412 --> 05:49.085
You guys ever shoot?

05:49.086 --> 05:52.666
Ever handled a weapon,
fire a gun, a rifle, anything?

05:57.190 --> 06:01.214
Dan Scott doesn't like
this, either.

06:22.768 --> 06:26.784
I was talking about pens.

06:26.785 --> 06:29.161
The last thing I said to Sara
before she died.

06:30.806 --> 06:32.944
She went to grab a drink,

06:32.945 --> 06:36.280
and I was babbling about the pen
I was using.

06:36.281 --> 06:38.717
And then she was gone.

06:38.718 --> 06:43.171
Sometimes I think
that we waste our words

06:43.172 --> 06:44.756
and we waste our moments

06:44.757 --> 06:47.142
and we don't take the time
to say the things

06:47.143 --> 06:49.728
that are in our hearts
when we have the chance.

06:53.933 --> 06:56.355
You saved me.

06:57.603 --> 07:01.610
I wouldn't have made it
without you.

07:01.611 --> 07:05.656
Well, thank you, baby,
but where'd <i>that</i> come from?

07:05.657 --> 07:10.332
I was just thinking it,
and I wanted to say it.

07:10.333 --> 07:12.955
You're always with me,
Quinn.

07:12.956 --> 07:14.753
Good.

07:14.754 --> 07:17.626
That's right where
I want to be.

07:19.925 --> 07:22.256
<i>It doesn't matter
how far I go, Jamie Scott...</i>

07:22.257 --> 07:23.845
<i>You're always with me.</i>

07:23.846 --> 07:27.665
<i>Even when I'm in some ghetto
in wherever I'm at.</i>

07:27.666 --> 07:29.179
<i>But, uh...</i>

07:29.180 --> 07:30.385
<i>You be good, okay?</i>

07:30.386 --> 07:32.053
<i>Be good to your mom
and Lydia.</i>

07:32.054 --> 07:34.310
<i>Help out around the house.
I'll be home soon.</i>

07:34.311 --> 07:36.938
<i>You're a good man, son.
I love you.</i>

07:39.042 --> 07:43.152
<i>There was
a moment when I was lost...</i>

07:43.153 --> 07:45.233
<i>When they had beaten me</i>

07:45.234 --> 07:48.753
<i>and I decided to beg them
to let me live...</i>

07:48.754 --> 07:52.874
<i>To see my beautiful wife,
my son, and my daughter...</i>

07:52.875 --> 07:57.379
<i>To breathe another breath
and lie in the sun and just...</i>

07:57.380 --> 08:00.415
<i>Live.</i>

08:00.416 --> 08:03.468
<i>But begging them
wouldn't change things.</i>

08:03.469 --> 08:06.304
<i>It would only
give them satisfaction,</i>

08:06.305 --> 08:08.256
<i>and</i> that <i>i wouldn't do.</i>

08:08.257 --> 08:10.225
<i>No.</i>

08:10.226 --> 08:12.844
<i>This would be the job
they carried with them</i>

08:12.845 --> 08:14.433
<i>for the rest of their lives.</i>

08:14.434 --> 08:17.098
<i>This would be the one
they felt guilty about,</i>

08:17.099 --> 08:18.650
<i>their older, fading selves</i>

08:18.651 --> 08:21.336
<i>woke up regretting
in the middle of the night,</i>

08:21.337 --> 08:23.021
<i>trying to quiet their remorse</i>

08:23.022 --> 08:24.860
<i>before their own deaths
were upon them.</i>

08:25.374 --> 08:29.744
<i>So I made a decision...
To give them nothing.</i>

08:29.745 --> 08:34.783
<i>And in that moment,
one word came to mind.</i>

08:34.784 --> 08:36.371
Fortitude.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.473
Whoa-ho-ho.
What happened?

08:59.608 --> 09:02.064
Oh, my God,
you crazy bitch!

09:02.065 --> 09:04.941
Turn around and walk
the hell out of here

09:04.942 --> 09:09.237
before I beat your scrawny ass
with my bare damn hands.

09:09.238 --> 09:10.906
What the hell
are you mad at <i>me</i> for?

09:10.907 --> 09:12.741
Don't play even dumber
with me.

09:12.742 --> 09:14.827
Oh, what,
you think <i>i</i> did this?

09:14.828 --> 09:17.542
Okay, fine.
Call the cops.

09:17.543 --> 09:19.244
My employees tell me
you're the slut

09:19.245 --> 09:21.212
that cried wolf these days
anyway, Brooke.

09:21.213 --> 09:25.211
So make the call... really,
I cannot <i>wait to hear your proof.</i>

09:25.212 --> 09:27.469
I know what I know,

09:27.470 --> 09:29.842
and either you did this

09:29.843 --> 09:31.635
or that psychotic employee
you hired did.

09:31.636 --> 09:35.764
Either way, you are to blame,
so get the hell out!

09:35.765 --> 09:37.808
You are crazy.

09:37.809 --> 09:38.934
Hey.

09:38.935 --> 09:40.978
If you didn't do this,

09:40.979 --> 09:43.485
now yow know
what you're dealing with.

09:43.486 --> 09:44.602
And if you did,

09:44.603 --> 09:47.443
I <i>always</i> knew
what I was dealing with.

09:49.992 --> 09:52.031
Whatever.

10:02.321 --> 10:04.088
Geez!

10:07.426 --> 10:10.211
Oh!
I'm getting closer!

10:10.212 --> 10:12.330
I should get bonus points
for that, right?

10:12.331 --> 10:13.765
Sure.
Maybe one of the bad guys

10:13.766 --> 10:16.100
should just lie down
because you almost shot him.

10:17.574 --> 10:21.602
Yeah, Chris Keller was thinking
he'd be more of a lookout,

10:21.603 --> 10:24.142
like kind of hang back and offer
moral support from afar.

10:24.143 --> 10:25.894
What about you, Julian?

10:25.895 --> 10:27.691
You just want to hang back
and offer moral support, too?

10:27.692 --> 10:29.067
No.

10:30.032 --> 10:31.195
Geez!

10:31.196 --> 10:34.239
You sure you thought
this thing through, Keller?

10:34.240 --> 10:36.037
What's that
supposed to mean?

10:36.038 --> 10:37.822
You say you want
to help Haley.

10:37.823 --> 10:40.829
You have a thing for her.
You have since high school.

10:40.830 --> 10:43.415
So?

10:43.416 --> 10:45.580
So from where I stand,
this is a lose/lose for you.

10:45.581 --> 10:47.377
If you don't bring Nathan back,
you failed her.

10:47.378 --> 10:49.834
If you do,
you lose her anyway.

10:49.835 --> 10:53.217
Once Nathan comes home,
you're out of the picture.

10:53.218 --> 10:54.676
So are you.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.053
Yeah.

10:57.054 --> 10:59.210
Haley told me
all about it.

10:59.211 --> 11:01.763
Once Nathan comes back,
you lose your family.

11:01.764 --> 11:04.599
So, from where I'm standing,
it's worse for you,

11:04.600 --> 11:06.935
because I lose what I never had,
but you had it...

11:06.936 --> 11:11.189
Your son, your grandkids,
all of it.

11:11.190 --> 11:13.491
But here we are.

11:17.279 --> 11:18.951
What about you, Baker?

11:18.952 --> 11:21.115
What's your role
in all this?

11:21.116 --> 11:22.872
Nathan's my friend.

11:22.873 --> 11:25.119
Not really.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.000
I'd say he's more
of an acquaintance.

11:27.001 --> 11:29.920
Nobody's gonna lay down
their life for an acquaintance.

11:29.921 --> 11:32.756
This still about you leaving
your kids in the car?

11:32.757 --> 11:35.246
No.

11:35.247 --> 11:38.433
I need to believe
that there's still justice,

11:38.434 --> 11:41.185
that even now in a world
full of gray

11:41.186 --> 11:42.854
and spin and compromise,

11:43.327 --> 11:44.639
if you choose to do wrong

11:44.640 --> 11:47.525
and you prey on good people
when you do,

11:47.526 --> 11:49.690
someone will stand up
to you.

11:49.691 --> 11:53.481
Someone will take a stand
and fight back.

11:53.482 --> 11:55.196
Nathan's a good man.

11:55.197 --> 11:58.115
He deserves
a good life.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.743
Oh!

12:05.244 --> 12:06.457
Geez!

12:08.747 --> 12:10.211
Yeah,
I want one of <i>those.</i>

12:10.212 --> 12:14.052
Keep practicing.

12:14.053 --> 12:16.299
And then what?

12:16.300 --> 12:20.595
We wait until dark.

12:20.596 --> 12:22.593
Then we fight back.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.502
What are you
thinking about?

12:38.503 --> 12:40.804
Nathan.

12:40.805 --> 12:42.422
You?

12:42.423 --> 12:45.676
Haley and Jamie.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.778
And Lydia.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.127
He's alive.

12:52.128 --> 12:54.421
That's what I
was thinking.

12:54.422 --> 12:57.688
He's alive,
and he'll be coming home soon.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.300
I'm sure of it.

12:59.301 --> 13:01.928
Anything else is just...

13:01.929 --> 13:05.808
It's too impossible
to think about.

13:05.809 --> 13:08.310
Yeah.

13:08.311 --> 13:11.480
He's coming home.

13:26.584 --> 13:28.168
Okay.

13:28.169 --> 13:31.188
That moron goes inside to eat
around this time every night,

13:31.189 --> 13:33.140
then another guard
takes his place.

13:33.141 --> 13:34.474
That gives you
about 30 seconds

13:34.475 --> 13:36.193
to cut the lock on the gate
and get back to the car.

13:36.194 --> 13:38.145
I got this.

13:38.146 --> 13:40.397
Okay, that's good. If you got
this, then I don't have to.

13:42.070 --> 13:44.284
What, you guys
don't watch movies?

13:44.285 --> 13:46.653
The hero always dies
in the movies.

13:46.654 --> 13:48.350
30 seconds... go.

14:03.454 --> 14:04.825
Lock the doors.

14:04.826 --> 14:05.839
What?

14:05.840 --> 14:07.957
Lock the doors!

14:10.628 --> 14:11.678
Let me in.

14:11.679 --> 14:12.962
Don't let him in.

14:12.963 --> 14:15.432
Guys, come on,
the door's locked.

14:15.433 --> 14:17.588
Keller, open the door!

14:17.589 --> 14:22.426
Julian, you have a family.
Go home.

15:11.873 --> 15:13.774
Baby, I can't talk right now.

15:13.775 --> 15:15.812
I am not gonna let him
intimidate me.

15:15.813 --> 15:16.693
Who?

15:16.694 --> 15:17.878
Xavier.

15:17.879 --> 15:19.191
I'm not afraid of him.

15:19.192 --> 15:20.775
Why?
What's going on?

15:20.776 --> 15:22.820
Why are you whispering?
Where are you?

15:22.821 --> 15:24.668
I'm...

15:24.669 --> 15:26.169
In a movie.

15:26.170 --> 15:27.157
Where are you?

15:27.158 --> 15:28.972
I-I'm at the café.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.870
Is everything okay?

15:31.871 --> 15:35.178
Yeah, everything's fine.

15:35.179 --> 15:37.347
Go back to your movie.

15:37.348 --> 15:38.836
Are you sure
everything's fine?

15:38.837 --> 15:40.484
Yeah.

15:40.485 --> 15:42.218
Xavier wants
to mess with me,

15:42.219 --> 15:44.404
he's gonna have a hell
of a fight on his hands.

15:44.405 --> 15:45.968
Absolutely not, Brooke.

15:45.969 --> 15:47.491
If something's going on,

15:47.492 --> 15:50.527
you need to call the police
or lock up and go home or both.

15:50.528 --> 15:52.265
I know.

15:52.266 --> 15:53.432
Promise me.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.562
Baby,
promise me you'll do that.

15:57.563 --> 16:00.607
I'm just so tired of it.

16:00.608 --> 16:03.026
You know, injustice.

16:03.027 --> 16:05.575
Trust me, I know, okay?
I do.

16:05.576 --> 16:08.512
But I love you,
and I need you safe.

16:08.513 --> 16:10.614
And our boys need you safe.

16:10.615 --> 16:11.869
Okay?

16:11.870 --> 16:13.620
Yeah.

16:13.621 --> 16:15.580
Okay, go home.
I'll see you there.

16:15.581 --> 16:17.958
Okay. I love you.

16:17.959 --> 16:19.543
I love you, too.

16:36.870 --> 16:37.908
We're just...
We're just gonna leave him?!

16:37.909 --> 16:39.270
He'll be fine.

16:39.271 --> 16:41.444
Yeah, but how come <i>he</i> gets
to go and <i>i</i> have to stay?

16:41.445 --> 16:42.746
Maybe we should
switch jobs.

16:42.747 --> 16:44.447
He should go with you.
I should run and hide.

16:44.448 --> 16:45.735
He's got a family.

16:45.736 --> 16:46.950
I might have a family.

16:46.951 --> 16:49.386
Dude, Chris Keller has all kinds
of crazy sex.

16:49.387 --> 16:51.325
Maybe I should just get out
just in case.

16:51.326 --> 16:52.288
You can't.

16:52.289 --> 16:53.289
Why not?

16:55.292 --> 16:57.016
You called shotgun.

17:41.726 --> 17:43.690
- Haley, it's okay.
- Just...

17:43.691 --> 17:44.975
I'll call them.

17:44.976 --> 17:48.048
You go upstairs and relax.
Let me clean this up.

17:48.049 --> 17:50.363
You know, I'm okay.
I don't need any help.

17:50.364 --> 17:52.699
I just want to be alone.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.684
It's gonna be okay.
Haley...

17:54.685 --> 17:56.223
I want to be alone.

18:36.817 --> 18:38.317
I want you
to listen to me,

18:38.318 --> 18:40.753
and I want you to do exactly
what I tell you to do.

18:40.754 --> 18:42.839
In a minute,
you're gonna hear a gunshot.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.124
When you do, I want you
to create a diversion

18:45.125 --> 18:46.593
on this side
of the building.

18:46.594 --> 18:48.678
Okay, diversion.
I got it.

18:48.679 --> 18:50.193
What kind of diversion?

18:50.194 --> 18:52.029
Anything that draws
their attention.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.601
Okay, but...
If I get their attention,

18:54.602 --> 18:56.686
they're gonna chase me
with guns

18:56.687 --> 18:59.161
and really sour looks
on their faces.

18:59.162 --> 19:00.640
Chris Keller
doesn't like that.

19:00.641 --> 19:02.525
Well, maybe you can sing them
one of your songs

19:02.526 --> 19:04.541
and drive them away like you did
most of your fan base.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.029
Whoa!

19:06.030 --> 19:07.564
Okay, I know
we're all keyed up here

19:07.565 --> 19:08.698
and there's a lot
of tension,

19:08.699 --> 19:10.182
but there's no need
to get personal.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.382
A diversion.

19:12.383 --> 19:13.592
A diversion... fine.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.512
I'm just saying, it stings
a little. That's all.

19:18.993 --> 19:21.578
If you can,
leave the killing to me.

19:21.579 --> 19:23.246
I'm already on the list.

19:25.216 --> 19:27.750
Chris Keller
doesn't like this.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.607
Let's go.

19:57.414 --> 20:01.389
Oh, that is <i>so</i> not okay.

20:01.390 --> 20:03.286
All right,
it's gonna take some time

20:03.287 --> 20:05.143
to get to the other side
of the warehouse.

20:05.144 --> 20:07.573
Once you hear a gunshot,
you have one job.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.192
Okay,
create a distraction.

20:09.193 --> 20:10.409
And take out that guy.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.594
Wait, that's <i>two</i> jobs.

20:11.595 --> 20:12.629
It's the same job.

20:12.630 --> 20:13.777
Yeah, but that guy...

20:15.366 --> 20:17.634
Oh, take out
the little guy?

20:17.635 --> 20:20.219
Yeah,
Chris Keller can do that.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.305
I know you're scared,
but the fact you're here

20:22.306 --> 20:24.162
tells me there's a hero
inside you somewhere.

20:24.163 --> 20:25.663
Don't say "hero," man!

20:25.664 --> 20:27.143
Those guys die.

20:27.144 --> 20:30.930
You'll be fine.
Help me with the trunk.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.289
You know,
it's a little late.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.874
Maybe we should
come back.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.149
The neighbors might be asleep,
you know?

21:34.150 --> 21:36.579
I think you're good.

21:36.580 --> 21:39.132
Yeah,
you're probably right.

21:39.133 --> 21:41.739
You sure you don't want
to join me?

21:41.740 --> 21:43.069
No, that's okay.

21:43.070 --> 21:45.355
You two have a lot
to talk about.

21:45.356 --> 21:47.662
But if you need me,
I'm right here.

21:49.176 --> 21:51.707

21:54.470 --> 21:56.238
but I'm...

Okay.

22:18.253 --> 22:20.737
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Not the big guy!

22:20.738 --> 22:22.863
What happened
to the little Marty,

22:22.864 --> 22:24.498

30:48.480 --> 30:51.182
<i>You know,
my, uh, my father said</i>

30:51.183 --> 30:54.351
<i>that today would be
the greatest day of my life.</i>

30:54.352 --> 30:56.253
<i>And you're right, dad.
It is.</i>

30:56.688 --> 30:58.222
<i>But not because of basketball.</i>

30:58.223 --> 31:00.190
<i>You see, today...</i>

31:00.191 --> 31:04.135
<i>I learned that my wife, Haley,
is pregnant.</i>

31:05.996 --> 31:06.963
<i>And, um...</i>

31:06.964 --> 31:08.798
<i>And while it's a great honor</i>

31:08.799 --> 31:11.701
<i>to be recruited
to play at Duke,</i>

31:11.702 --> 31:14.562
<i>i guess what I have to say
to you today is this.</i>

31:15.206 --> 31:16.855
<i>Where I play basketball,</i>

31:16.856 --> 31:19.541
if <i>i play basketball,</i>

31:19.542 --> 31:22.444
<i>is no longer a decision
for me to make alone.</i>

31:22.812 --> 31:26.582
<i>It's a decision that I'll make
with my wife's and, uh...</i>

31:26.583 --> 31:29.035
<i>And my family's best interests
at heart.</i>

31:29.036 --> 31:32.186
<i>And when I do that,
I'll let you know.</i>

31:32.187 --> 31:34.989
<i>Now, my wife
couldn't be here tonight,</i>

31:34.990 --> 31:37.425
<i>so I just wanted to say
one thing.</i>

31:37.426 --> 31:38.670
<i>Haley...</i>

31:38.671 --> 31:42.696
<i>No matter what happens,
we'll face it together.</i>

31:42.697 --> 31:46.066
<i>But I promise you,
I've never been more happy.</i>

31:46.067 --> 31:47.701
<i>And everything's
gonna be okay.</i>

31:47.702 --> 31:49.969
<i>I love you.</i>

32:06.119 --> 32:07.319
How you doing, son?

32:07.320 --> 32:08.366
I'm okay.

32:08.367 --> 32:10.289
You think you can
walk out of here?

32:10.290 --> 32:11.452
Yeah, I can do it.

32:11.453 --> 32:12.995
And if we have to run?

32:12.996 --> 32:15.294
I don't know.

32:15.295 --> 32:17.208
Well, you were in that chair
a long time,

32:17.209 --> 32:19.165
but I'm gonna
get us out of here

32:19.166 --> 32:20.798
even if I have to
carry you out.

32:20.799 --> 32:23.034
I carried that douche bag
drug dealer in here.

32:23.035 --> 32:24.169
I'm gonna carry <i>you</i> out.

32:25.504 --> 32:26.904
Hold on.

32:26.905 --> 32:28.844
Hey. <i>Hey.</i>

32:28.845 --> 32:30.542
There's a door
through there.

32:30.543 --> 32:31.976
It's all wide-open space,

32:31.977 --> 32:34.392
but if we can make it across
to that door, we're home free.

32:34.393 --> 32:36.846
Then that's what
we're gonna do.

32:36.847 --> 32:39.021
Let me take a look.

32:39.022 --> 32:40.717
Okay.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.662
Boo!

32:55.131 --> 32:58.248
Help!

32:58.249 --> 33:00.876
Somebody help me!

33:43.043 --> 33:44.795
It's empty.

33:46.813 --> 33:49.008
It's empty, son.

33:49.009 --> 33:51.552
They don't know that.

33:53.254 --> 33:54.555
You ready?

33:54.556 --> 33:56.765
Yeah.

33:56.766 --> 33:58.225
Nathan.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.059
You're my son.

34:01.060 --> 34:03.361
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

34:03.362 --> 34:04.732
I promise.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.068
Let's go.

34:15.908 --> 34:17.507
Dad.

34:20.879 --> 34:22.958
It's good to see you.

34:31.554 --> 34:33.342
Why?

34:34.594 --> 34:35.891
Why?!

34:35.893 --> 34:36.859
"Why?"

34:36.860 --> 34:38.928
There is no why.

34:38.929 --> 34:42.130
There's only what I want.

34:42.132 --> 34:43.800
No reason.

34:43.801 --> 34:44.980
No justice.

34:45.435 --> 34:47.608
No...

34:47.609 --> 34:49.150
Divine intervention.

34:49.152 --> 34:51.570
There's only you, me,

34:51.571 --> 34:57.012
and that wild, so-betrayed look
in your eyes.

34:57.880 --> 35:00.515
That look... that's why.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.498
That same look...

35:02.499 --> 35:04.875
That friend of yours had
right before I killed him...

35:06.888 --> 35:09.290
...in the gas station.

35:09.291 --> 35:13.060
It's that moment that you know
and accept...

35:13.061 --> 35:15.129
That this is it.

35:15.130 --> 35:18.598
This is <i>really
happening.</i>

35:18.599 --> 35:22.136
And no one's
gonna save you.

35:30.777 --> 35:33.237
Oh, my God.
That guy <i>is</i> creepy.

35:35.240 --> 35:37.032
Are you okay?

35:46.459 --> 35:49.862
No one's gonna save you!

36:14.185 --> 36:16.452
Son.

36:16.453 --> 36:17.854
Dad...

36:17.855 --> 36:19.908
Come on, I got you.

36:25.099 --> 36:26.562
Wait here.

36:36.206 --> 36:37.639
And curtain!

36:37.640 --> 36:38.974
No!

36:48.163 --> 36:51.319
I'm sorry, son.

36:51.320 --> 36:53.421
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dad... whoa, whoa.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.192
No, no, no.

37:02.397 --> 37:04.597
So messy.

37:06.500 --> 37:10.876
You know, is probably lesson
to be learned here about greed.

37:10.877 --> 37:13.796
Your father, dead.

37:13.797 --> 37:16.943
My friends, dead.

37:16.944 --> 37:19.845
Your people, my people.

37:19.846 --> 37:21.314
One difference...

37:21.315 --> 37:23.749
You will join them.

37:23.750 --> 37:25.217
I will not.

37:27.254 --> 37:30.522
The death I gave him.

37:30.523 --> 37:32.898
Thus bad begins...

37:32.899 --> 37:38.153
And worse remains behind.

37:59.317 --> 38:02.186
Like the father, the son.

38:18.869 --> 38:21.489
Bravo!
Bravo.

38:21.490 --> 38:23.240
You have the right
to drop that.

38:26.075 --> 38:29.611
What the hell, dude?
This was supposed to be easy.

38:29.612 --> 38:31.374
You grab some dork,
kill him, get paid,

38:31.375 --> 38:34.316
maybe seduce his wife
at some point.

38:34.317 --> 38:35.682
I mean, come on!

38:35.683 --> 38:37.584
Do I have to do
everything myself?

38:42.491 --> 38:44.678
Hey.

38:50.499 --> 38:52.978

38:52.979 --> 38:55.868
