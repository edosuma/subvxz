<i>Everyone thinks Harlem</i>
<i>was the capital of jazz in the 1930s.</i>

00:36.136 --> 00:40.334
<i>That all of New York flooded uptown</i>
<i>at night to party till dawn.</i>

00:40.507 --> 00:44.443
<i>Nice story, but unfortunately,</i>
<i>it's just not true.</i>

00:44.611 --> 00:48.741
<i>It was all happening in the little town</i>
<i>of Passaic, New Jersey.</i>

00:50.116 --> 00:52.448
<i>Passaic was the capital of jazz</i>
<i>in the '20s and '30s...</i>

00:52.619 --> 00:55.053
<i>... because of its own native son...</i>

00:55.221 --> 00:56.916
<i>... Thomas "Fats" Waller...</i>

00:57.090 --> 00:59.752
<i>... one of the greatest entertainers</i>
<i>of all time.</i>

00:59.926 --> 01:02.394
<i>Chapter 1, the birth of Fats Waller.</i>

01:02.562 --> 01:06.862
<i>It all began right here,</i>
<i>a hundred years ago...</i>

01:07.033 --> 01:09.501
<i>... in Passaic, New Jersey.</i>

01:09.669 --> 01:11.432
<i>Right here, on this block.</i>

01:11.604 --> 01:13.731
<i>It was a different neighborhood then,</i>
<i>but look here...</i>

01:13.907 --> 01:15.568
<i>... he was born at 261 Main Street.</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:18.575
<i>When he was young, he used to follow</i>
<i>his father around the streets...</i>

01:18.745 --> 01:21.009
<i>... because his father</i>
<i>was a street minister.</i>

01:21.181 --> 01:24.947
<i>He started playing piano, as I understand,</i>
<i>out in the streets here in Passaic...</i>

01:25.118 --> 01:26.142
<i>... on a harmonium.</i>

01:26.319 --> 01:29.777
<i>Poor boy put on pounds</i>
<i>faster than the price of aluminum.</i>

01:29.956 --> 01:33.119
<i>One-forty-seven.</i>

01:33.293 --> 01:35.784
<i>Thomas, you're gonna break</i>
<i>Dr. Benton 's scale.</i>

01:35.962 --> 01:37.452
<i>You're getting worse.</i>

01:37.630 --> 01:41.157
<i>Maybe that's why he would have to play</i>
<i>a very huge instrument.</i>

01:41.334 --> 01:43.996
<i>So he would spend nights here,</i>
<i>at the great organ.</i>

01:44.170 --> 01:46.764
<i>Fats used the church</i>
<i>as his training ground.</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:50.842
<i>And soon, all of Passaic</i>
<i>would know his name.</i>

01:51.010 --> 01:53.376
<i>Fats lived his life all in excess.</i>

01:53.546 --> 01:58.142
<i>Loads of music, loads of food</i>
<i>and loads of women.</i>

01:58.318 --> 02:03.051
<i>Who would expect a simple influenza virus</i>
<i>would get him in his bed?</i>

02:03.223 --> 02:04.952
<i>A sleeping-train bed, though.</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:09.925
<i>But still, the train had been stopped</i>
<i>in the freezing cold winter...</i>

02:10.096 --> 02:12.690
<i>... in the train station in Kansas City.</i>

02:12.866 --> 02:16.029
<i>Fats, are you okay? Fats? You okay?</i>

02:17.704 --> 02:20.229
<i>Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

02:25.078 --> 02:28.946
<i>Fats was the star</i>
<i>that made the whole town shine.</i>

02:39.225 --> 02:41.693
Hey, Jerry, hand me Number 9.

02:43.429 --> 02:46.694
<i>I will give you</i>

02:46.866 --> 02:49.926
- Okay. All right.
<i>- Number 9</i>

02:50.503 --> 02:51.993
<i>Handing you number</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:54.106
- Would you shut up?
<i>- Number 9</i>

02:55.308 --> 02:57.503
Could you just paint
and be quiet, please?

02:57.677 --> 02:59.167
Knock it off.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.505
It's terrible.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.886
- What the duck, Jerry?
- What?

03:13.059 --> 03:15.357
I asked you to give me Number 9,
the nose.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.722
Yeah, that's what I did.

03:16.896 --> 03:19.831
No, you didn't. This is Number 6.
This is the eye.

03:19.999 --> 03:23.264
All right, well, how am I supposed to tell
the difference between a six and a nine?

03:23.436 --> 03:25.961
Because we did both the eyes already,
you doofus.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.163
Come on, get organized.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.604
I told you, put the finished ones
in a separate pile.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.243
Look, what's the difference, man?

03:31.411 --> 03:34.403
A nostril and an upside-down eye
are the same anyway. It looks fine.

03:34.581 --> 03:38.483
Oh, is that supposed to be funny?
Are you trying to say Fats had big nostrils?

03:38.651 --> 03:41.176
- Jerry.
- Hi, officer, how's it going?

03:41.354 --> 03:44.517
Look what happened. Last night,
some hoodlums came and did...

03:44.691 --> 03:46.625
- Oh, really?
...all this stuff here, this...

03:46.793 --> 03:49.284
- Here we go again.
- It's disgusting.

03:49.462 --> 03:52.397
- I hate graffiti.
- Yeah, they even left the ladder.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.931
That's, like, evidence.
We should confiscate it.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.467
- Catch them.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.468
You're getting on my nerves.

03:59.639 --> 04:02.836
You keep this up,
you'll be spending the night in jail.

04:03.009 --> 04:05.000
- Okay.
- Moron.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.373
If... If they come back for the ladder,
we'll catch them.

04:07.547 --> 04:11.449
Hey, fellas, is that supposed to be
Biggie Smalls or something?

04:11.618 --> 04:14.644
No, man, that's that dead old blues guy,
Louis Armstrong.

04:14.821 --> 04:18.154
No, my ignorant little buddies,
this is Fats Waller.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.224
- Really?
- Famous <i>jazz</i> musician.

04:20.392 --> 04:23.851
He was born in my building
about a hundred years ago.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.328
<i>- Ice cream, anyone?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

04:30.503 --> 04:32.835
That's what I'm talking about.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.506
Mr. Fletcher, you know,
really, seriously...

04:36.676 --> 04:39.201
...if you don't like the painting,
you can... You can tell me.

04:39.379 --> 04:43.281
I know that there's something wrong
with the nose, I don't know if you noticed.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.979
What about the authorities, Mike?

04:46.152 --> 04:48.882
The city already has issues
with the building as it is.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.489
Mr. Fletcher, you don't have
to worry about the police.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.627
- I worked my magic on them.
- Yeah, he did confuse them.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.785
Okay, they think some gangsters did it.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.988
- And you confused them?
- Yeah, with my finesse.

04:59.165 --> 05:02.191
Yeah, I feel great. You sure
this is gonna bring us more customers?

05:02.368 --> 05:05.565
I hope so. I mean, anyway, don't you think
it's time the people around here...

05:05.738 --> 05:09.139
...started to learn a bit little about, you
know, the history of their neighborhood?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.709
I mean, people don't even know
who Fats is.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.574
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Hey. Hey. That's not true.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.546
- We know who Fats Waller is.
- Is that right?

05:17.717 --> 05:19.981
Bet you can't sing a <i>jazz</i> song.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.054
- Oh, challenge.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.950
That's not <i>jazz.</i>

05:26.125 --> 05:27.183
<i>Fuzzy, oh, oh</i>

05:27.360 --> 05:31.319
<i>Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear</i>
<i>Fuzzy jazzy had no hair</i>

05:31.497 --> 05:33.829
<i>Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:37.595
<i>Yes, he was, he was Fuzzy</i>
<i>Had a fuzzy face</i>

05:37.770 --> 05:42.070
<i>Check this out and let me say</i>
<i>One thing to you</i>

05:42.241 --> 05:44.709
<i>Watch me play my fuzzy bass</i>

05:48.981 --> 05:50.039
Standup bass.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.751
I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.445
It's all right, Jerry. I got it.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.214
Actually, you gotta go back to work.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.723
Duty calls. You gotta
go back to the microwave.

06:00.893 --> 06:02.793
I think I saw one of your creations
just roll by.

06:02.962 --> 06:05.055
- Turn the microwave on high.
- You think it's a joke?

06:05.231 --> 06:07.756
Let me tell you, you're gonna
be responsible for my brain tumor.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.129
- All of you guys are.
- Where the hell is Jerry?

06:10.303 --> 06:11.531
Man, what's her problem?

06:11.704 --> 06:14.036
She said she wanted a sporty car,
now she's freaking out.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.299
You did that?

06:19.178 --> 06:21.806
- I don't want this.
- Don't forget your salad bowl.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.176
I told you she wouldn't be
into them big pipes.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.079
Polish or not, she's still a girl.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.618
Come on, Wilson.
She couldn't get the doors open.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.222
Well, she could have went through
the window.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.086
These damn helmets.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.888
I don't think they're helping
with the microwaves at all.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.394
Oh, you'll thank me.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.499
- All right, I'll see you in the morning.
- All right, thanks.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.917
Good night, Mike.
Don't forget to turn out the lights.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.951
Good night, Mr. Fletcher.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.499
<i>A rent party was the place to be</i>
<i>in the '20s and '30s.</i>

07:19.672 --> 07:20.696
They were jumping.

07:20.873 --> 07:22.932
If you didn't have enough money
to cover your rent...

07:23.109 --> 07:27.307
...you'd invite a few musicians,
charge for drinks, and you'd get it on.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.948
Everybody would throw
just a little bit in the pot.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.981
<i>A dollar, whatever they could spare.</i>

07:32.151 --> 07:34.585
Jerry doesn't believe you've ever been
to a rent party, Mr. Fletcher.

07:34.754 --> 07:36.779
What are you talking about?
I never said that.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.287
Oh, man, I used to go to all of them.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.619
That's where I'd meet
all the girls on Saturday night.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.353
I can't imagine you with a girl,
Mr. Fletcher.

07:43.529 --> 07:46.657
Oh, nice, that's great. That's perfect.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.266
Yeah, what about you, Jerry?

07:48.434 --> 07:51.961
I don't see much action
coming out of your trailer at night.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.369
When I was your age,
my balls were flapping so hard...

07:55.541 --> 07:58.305
... I had to scrape them off the ground
and beg them to come home with me.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.878
- Come on, balls.
- Yeah, come on.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.106
Come on. That's hilarious.

08:03.282 --> 08:04.306
What about you, Mike?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.418
When was the last time you heard
some action coming out of his room?

08:06.586 --> 08:08.076
Why are you all worried about me for?

08:08.254 --> 08:09.949
I heard some action sometime.

08:10.122 --> 08:13.523
Now, it's more like a trumpet solo.

08:15.595 --> 08:16.653
Trumpet solo.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.763
Could you close your mouth
when you chew? Thanks.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.660
How come you never got married,
Mr. Fletcher?

08:20.833 --> 08:24.496
Well, the common story is...

08:24.670 --> 08:27.901
...the girl that you was gonna ask,
you waited too long to ask...

08:28.074 --> 08:30.406
...and she went on
and married somebody else.

08:30.576 --> 08:33.669
And then you can't find anybody
that compared to her.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.746
So, what happens? You get old.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.817
Obviously we're looking
at a real improvement in quality of life.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.963
These brand-new condominiums
are gonna bring us...

08:51.130 --> 08:53.155
...the fresh blood
that we need for our community...

08:53.332 --> 08:56.199
...and transform this slum forever.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.702
<i>"Slum"?</i> Hey, this is not a slum.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.899
Hey, sure, the place needs a few repairs,
but I'm taking care of it.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.203
Look, look,
business is about to pick up.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.607
I can feel it.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.943
I'm sorry, Mr. Fletcher,
but the building is condemned.

09:11.117 --> 09:14.883
It violates structural,
fire and plumbing standards.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.818
I don't see wheelchair access.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.753
Your video store is a tenement.

09:20.426 --> 09:23.554
You have 60 days from this notice
of demolition...

09:23.729 --> 09:26.698
...to bring it up to code,
otherwise we will have to demolish it.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.857
- But we will relocate you...
- Yes.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.936
...to a property
of proportionate fair-market value.

09:32.104 --> 09:33.662
Projects aren't so bad, you know.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.739
Move to the projects?

09:38.177 --> 09:39.667
How am I gonna tell Mike?

09:39.845 --> 09:43.941
Look, I just wanna improve the life
of the people of Passaic, that's all.

09:46.986 --> 09:50.547
You know, you don't have to pay me
this month, Mr. Fletcher. I'm okay.

09:50.723 --> 09:54.159
Don't worry about the money, Mike.
I'll pay you soon.

09:54.794 --> 09:59.060
In fact, I... I need for you
to take over for me.

09:59.231 --> 10:01.290
- You're retiring?
- Oh, no, no, no.

10:01.467 --> 10:04.231
This year's the 60th anniversary
of Fats' death.

10:04.403 --> 10:07.861
And there's a ceremony
that's being organized in commemoration.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.907
We gonna all get together
in that abandoned train where he died...

10:11.077 --> 10:13.170
...and we're gonna play his records
until morning.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.143
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.111
I wanna come. Can I come with you?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.375
No.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.485
I just told you,
I need you to take over for me.

10:20.653 --> 10:24.612
Oh, right, right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Okay.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.020
You want me to just run the shop
while you're gone?

10:27.193 --> 10:28.558
You think I could do that?

10:28.728 --> 10:30.457
You tell me.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.622
I'm not gonna let you down,
Mr. Fletcher.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.827
Good, just don't set the place on fire.

10:35.001 --> 10:38.994
Oh, no. Service, quality, safety,
you can count on that.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.036
Excellent.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.334
Here's something really important:

10:43.509 --> 10:44.601
You must never...

10:44.777 --> 10:46.745
Slam the door, because
the building will collapse.

10:46.912 --> 10:50.905
No, Mike. I mean, yes,
but that's not what I wanted to say.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.779
- You must never...
- Use the VCR to rewind the tapes...

10:53.953 --> 10:56.319
No. Why do you always
have to finish my sentences?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.650
- Okay, just listen.
- Okay. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.657
Okay, you must... Damn it.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.695
Now I forgot what I had to say.

11:04.864 --> 11:07.264
- But it's very...
- Lock the door.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.962
- Mr. Fletcher, have a good trip.
- I'll have a good trip.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.535
Take some pictures and call me.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.228
Oh, yes, yes. I... I remember.

11:14.206 --> 11:15.696
See, you wanted to finish my sentence.

11:15.875 --> 11:19.333
- I lost my focus. I can't...
- No, no. I was listening. I was listening.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.606
Hey, Mike. Mike. Keep Jerry...

11:22.782 --> 11:25.046
I can't hear you.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.610
Keep Jerry out. Out, out.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.418
What? I don't know what that means.

11:32.591 --> 11:35.185
<i>"Peek your edge too.
Peek your <i>edge..."</i></i>

11:35.428 --> 11:40.365
<i>"Tuo. Too. Peek your edge too."</i>

11:40.533 --> 11:42.364
That's what it is.

11:42.768 --> 11:45.737
I just found out something sad today.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.231
Mr. Fletcher can't spell.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.643
Maybe his parents
couldn't afford school.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.508
Did he have parents?

11:56.482 --> 11:58.643
- Yeah.
- Interesting.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.150
Don't mention this to anybody.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.721
- Just keep this between us. Don't...
- Of course not, that would be racist.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.155
Peek your... Pick.

12:08.327 --> 12:09.817
Your age. Pick your age.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.019
He's talking gibberish.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.826
It's nonsense, but it's not his fault.

12:16.335 --> 12:19.031
The power plant's controlling us.
I know it.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.139
- Through microwaves.
- Mm-hm.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.071
They're using it to make us do things.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.438
To buy things, to accept things.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.978
And who...? Who...? Who are they?
Who are "they"?

12:29.148 --> 12:31.981
The government, the FBI, of course.

12:32.151 --> 12:34.745
- And I say no more.
- Right.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.047
I'm gonna sabotage
the power plant tonight...

12:37.223 --> 12:38.588
...and you're gonna help me.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.318
Look, I got a map.
Completely worked out.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.621
We short-circuit this
with whatever that thing is.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.661
And that blows up the transformer.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.492
All we gotta do is climb the fence...

12:47.666 --> 12:51.500
...and throw this sweet grappling hook
right into the transformer. Boom.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.266
You know what I mean?

12:53.439 --> 12:55.031
Yeah.

12:55.207 --> 12:57.607
This, my friend, is your camouflage.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.074
Camouflage.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.269
Bones.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.811
We need that electricity.

13:01.981 --> 13:05.144
You know, we got the machines, we...
And nobody rewinds the tapes.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.251
- This is more important than that.
- You gotta rewind the tapes.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.011
That's the lamest excuse
I've ever heard.

13:09.188 --> 13:11.952
It's totally non-sequitury,
what you're saying to me.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.955
- It's a lame excuse?
- Yeah, it's lame.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.321
Really? And the power plant
is controlling us?

13:16.495 --> 13:18.122
That's not nonsense?
That's not paranoia?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.390
Okay, it sounds crazy,
and you know why?

13:20.566 --> 13:22.966
- Because it's affecting my brain too.
- Mm-hm.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.159
It's paranizing it.

13:24.336 --> 13:27.271
Mr. Fletcher left me
in charge of the store.

13:27.439 --> 13:30.237
Me. He trusted me with the store.
Do you know what that means?

13:30.409 --> 13:33.378
No, actually I don't.
Maybe you could explain it to me.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.138
- It means that I'm not doing this.
- What?

13:35.314 --> 13:36.611
- I'm not doing this with you.
- Okay.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.443
So you'll just do anything
Mr. Fletcher says...

13:38.617 --> 13:40.551
...even though, by the way,
he's not your real father.

13:40.719 --> 13:42.550
- So... So what?
- And he's completely illiterate.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.018
- He's not...
- But you won't do anything for me...

13:44.190 --> 13:45.919
...your best friend,
who has a melting brain.

13:46.091 --> 13:49.527
Can l...? Can l...? Can I help you
make a selection? Because if not...

13:49.695 --> 13:52.823
... I'm gonna have to ask you
to make space for the other customers.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.425
Oh, sorry, I didn't <i>realize</i>
it was rush hour.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.000
I won't bother you anymore.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.195
You know, it does get busy unexpectedly.

14:00.372 --> 14:01.805
And you know, he's not illiterate.

14:01.974 --> 14:04.772
First of all, because if he was illiterate,
smart guy...

14:04.944 --> 14:06.468
... he wouldn't be able to write:

14:06.645 --> 14:08.476
<i>"Peek your edge too."</i>

14:08.647 --> 14:11.810
Which is... It's probably Buddhist
or something.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.781
It's like... Like a chant.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.387
<i>"Peek your... Pick your edge too."</i>

14:16.889 --> 14:18.823
<i>- Smart guy.</i>
- I'm not saying he's illiterate.

14:18.991 --> 14:22.154
I mean, he could just use some
night-schooling to perfect his spelling.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.818
Just go.

14:24.597 --> 14:25.894
Slow. Slower.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.769
You all right?

14:34.940 --> 14:36.373
Come on over. It's easy.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.811
Freeze.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.581
They always come at night
and bother me.

14:50.756 --> 14:55.056
- Oh, come on, it's my turn tonight.
- No way. This is my baby.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.457
Department of Homeland Security.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.029
Wake up.

14:59.198 --> 15:00.597
Be invisible.

15:00.766 --> 15:01.926
Shh, did you hear something?

15:02.101 --> 15:03.693
Yeah.

15:07.606 --> 15:08.971
There's that ladder again.

15:11.277 --> 15:12.642
What do you think?

15:12.811 --> 15:15.644
I don't know, some kind of ladder gang
or something?

15:15.814 --> 15:17.543
Oh, the ladder gang.

15:17.716 --> 15:20.082
Let's go get some ice cream.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.830
<i>- "Peek your edge too."</i>
- What's so funny?

15:32.998 --> 15:34.226
<i>"Keep Jerry out."</i>

15:34.400 --> 15:38.131
- Who cares about that right now?
- He's not <i>illiterate.</i> "Keep Jerry <i>out."</i>

15:38.771 --> 15:40.636
- He's not illiterate.
- Who cares? Get over...

15:40.806 --> 15:42.797
- What are you doing?
- I can't be here for this.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.772
What are you doing? Mike, no. Mike.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.344
- Mike, put that ladder back.
- I can't let you in the store.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.981
- Mike, you're coming over the thing.
- Mr. Fletcher trusted me.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.640
Mr. Fletcher's not gonna yell at you,
he's way too laid back.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.218
I know he's not gonna yell at me.
That's part of the problem.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.582
He's very good to me. I can't
let him down. I can't disappoint him.

15:57.756 --> 15:58.780
Listen, you don't need me.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.789
- You're almost there.
- I'll never speak to you.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.393
I will never speak to you again.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.961
Mike! Mike!

16:06.332 --> 16:08.027
Traitor.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.358
I'll do it alone, baby.

16:09.935 --> 16:11.994
Solo mission.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.002
Solo sabotage.

16:22.614 --> 16:25.082
Mike! Come back!

16:42.801 --> 16:44.632
No, Jerry, no.

16:44.803 --> 16:47.397
No. No. You have to go.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.935
You see the signs? "Keep Jerry <i>out."</i>

16:51.110 --> 16:52.509
This is in, that's out.

16:53.645 --> 16:57.172
Go home, take a shower, lie down.

17:10.362 --> 17:14.263
Oh, come on.

17:17.269 --> 17:18.998
Get out of the street.
Get out of the street.

17:19.171 --> 17:22.071
Wipe your face.
Jesus. Stand right there.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.300
I'll get you some water.

17:24.742 --> 17:27.233
Don't move, just wait a minute.

17:36.588 --> 17:39.716
Oh, you feeling better now?

17:39.892 --> 17:44.886
Mike, aren't you gonna ask me
how the sabotage went?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.190
No, I wasn't, actually.

17:46.365 --> 17:49.334
Oh, come on,
ask me how the sabotage went.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.435
Okay, how'd the sabotage go?

17:51.603 --> 17:54.128
Terrible. It was a two-man operation.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.734
- It was a two-person sabotage.
- Shh.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.845
Ma'am, if you need any help,
just let me know.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.743
How about if I need any help?
Should I let you know?

18:03.916 --> 18:06.009
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Yeah, apparently not.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.743
Thanks.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.190
Oh, that's not in alphabetical order.

18:16.361 --> 18:18.329
I know that, it's the new order.
Excuse me.

18:18.497 --> 18:20.260
- Do you work here? I don't think so.
- Jerry.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.764
Haven't you heard
about the new West Coast Video...

18:22.935 --> 18:25.563
...more efficient,
non-alphabetical order...

18:25.737 --> 18:27.432
... Miss l-Know-Where-to-Put-the-Videos?

18:30.008 --> 18:32.977
No, it's time for me
to educate your customers.

18:33.145 --> 18:35.409
Do you put everything in your house
in alphabetical order?

18:35.581 --> 18:38.049
- Like all of your food in the refrigerator?
- You know, maybe...

18:38.217 --> 18:40.981
- Apples, bananas, carrots.
- She might, and that would be fine...

18:41.153 --> 18:43.485
- Ding-Dongs.
...because she didn't do anything wrong.

18:43.655 --> 18:46.215
You know what I just realized?
I bet she's super-organized.

18:46.391 --> 18:49.258
She's really like:
I hate those kind of people.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.328
- You are incredibly rude.
- Don't attack me, lady.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.988
- You're incredibly rude, mister.
- Are you done yelling in my ear?

18:54.166 --> 18:55.190
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- I'm sorry.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.062
Did I put your forks
into the spoon drawer?

18:57.236 --> 18:59.227
- Go home.
- Don't put the TV next to the radio.

18:59.404 --> 19:00.894
- Why don't you just go, go, go?
- Get some rest.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.700
- Lunatic!
- You're the cuckoo. Hey. Hey.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.901
Don't put the shoes in the refrigerator,
because they'll get cold.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.810
- Wow...
- Dumb broad.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.040
- I am really, really sorry.
- Yeah.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.376
He's a veteran, actually.

19:12.551 --> 19:15.418
He's had a lot of exposure to,
you know, chemicals and stuff.

19:15.587 --> 19:19.580
If there's anything you need, we got...
We got books, we got albums.

19:19.758 --> 19:21.953
I got some refreshments
in the icebox.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.219
Okay, I appreciate it.

19:23.395 --> 19:24.919
You're welcome.

19:36.441 --> 19:37.465
Fletcher...

19:39.111 --> 19:44.572
...you'll pull through. Every time you think
it's the end, you always pull through.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.945
Look here, look here, Mo.
I wish it was that easy, man.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.518
But not this time.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.417
I can't adapt, and that's why I'm broke.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.423
Fletcher, this is America.

19:54.593 --> 19:57.153
Anybody can make money.

19:57.329 --> 20:00.492
But you...
No, let me show you something.

20:00.666 --> 20:03.362
We made a ton of money
with this little thing.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.129
- What, this is a dish-squirting brush?
- Mm-hm.

20:06.305 --> 20:09.138
- And the soap goes in here?
- Yep. Yep.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.469
- A great idea.
- You know, the squirting idea...

20:11.643 --> 20:12.974
... has been around for years.

20:13.145 --> 20:16.444
But we didn't make squat
until we added this.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.776
A stainless-steel cover on the handle.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.748
People going <i>crazy</i> over it.

20:20.919 --> 20:24.411
- Man, our sales increased 800 percent.
- What?

20:24.590 --> 20:29.425
And we expanded our market share
tenfold in two years.

20:29.595 --> 20:33.053
You need to go visit all
of the successful renting businesses...

20:33.232 --> 20:36.099
...and learn and adapt.
You said you can't adapt.

20:36.268 --> 20:39.169
Adapt. Then just give the people
what they want.

20:39.338 --> 20:42.796
- That's all you gotta do.
- Give the people what they want.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.487
<i>Hello?</i>

21:05.664 --> 21:06.892
Hello, Miss <i>Falewicz?</i> It's...

21:07.065 --> 21:09.659
I... I know who this is, Mr. Fletcher.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.565
I... I was hoping to hear from you.

21:12.738 --> 21:16.071
I was calling regarding the tape
of <i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

21:16.241 --> 21:17.731
Mike told me you still have it.

21:17.909 --> 21:19.501
<i>Oh, do I?</i>

21:19.678 --> 21:22.306
Well, I'll find it and...
And bring it by tomorrow.

21:22.481 --> 21:24.506
Oh, no hurry.
I'm... I'm out of town anyway.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.447
I'm doing a little work
and doing a little research.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.917
<i>Oh? Well, how long will you be gone?</i>

21:30.088 --> 21:32.249
- A week at the most.
<i>- Really.</i>

21:32.424 --> 21:34.255
- Can I ask a favor?
- Yes.

21:34.426 --> 21:37.293
Would you keep an eye out on Jerry
for me while I'm gone?

21:37.462 --> 21:39.157
He destroys everything he touches.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.932
Hi, good morning.

21:51.108 --> 21:53.201
- It's blank.
- I'm sorry?

21:53.377 --> 21:56.141
Rewound this tape all over,
and it's blank.

21:56.314 --> 21:57.941
Really? Did you check the...?

21:58.115 --> 21:59.844
Sure did. Checked that.

22:00.017 --> 22:02.281
You know, sometimes
you gotta use head cleaner...

22:02.453 --> 22:03.545
Okay. I did that, actually.

22:03.721 --> 22:05.120
It'll eat the tapes.

22:05.289 --> 22:07.052
I'll just pop it in, see what's going on.

22:07.224 --> 22:08.714
Excuse me, this video don't work.

22:08.893 --> 22:10.224
- Sorry?
- It don't work.

22:10.394 --> 22:12.021
It does... It won't play?

22:12.196 --> 22:14.824
No, I rewound it,
I played it and everything.

22:14.999 --> 22:16.728
It's nothing but <i>fuzz.</i> Yeah, like that.

22:17.335 --> 22:20.031
Huh. Is your VCR NTSC?

22:20.204 --> 22:21.262
No, it's brand-new.

22:21.439 --> 22:23.339
Do you always blame
everything on the customer?

22:23.507 --> 22:25.304
- No, not at all.
- Where is...?

22:25.476 --> 22:26.738
Where's...? Where's Mr. Fletcher?

22:26.911 --> 22:30.403
He's away on a...
On a memorial trip...

22:30.581 --> 22:34.540
...so he left me in charge
as manager of the store.

22:34.719 --> 22:36.118
So you know what I'm gonna do?

22:36.287 --> 22:40.883
Both of you, free of charge, can have
any two tapes that you'd like in the shop.

22:41.058 --> 22:45.222
No, thanks. What I would like
is to be reimbursed my dollar.

22:45.396 --> 22:46.886
- Okay.
- Because I've had enough.

22:47.064 --> 22:49.624
Okay. Is there anything
that I could do to make...?

22:49.800 --> 22:51.495
No, just my dollar.

22:51.669 --> 22:53.330
I'll just... I was just...

22:54.138 --> 22:56.299
- I'm really sorry about all this.
- Unfortunate.

22:56.474 --> 22:58.032
Yeah, the whole thing is unfortunate.

22:58.209 --> 23:00.336
This button... I'm really... Okay.

23:00.511 --> 23:01.773
That one right there.

23:01.946 --> 23:03.846
I tried... Oh, that's not it either.

23:04.014 --> 23:05.538
You know what?
I think I have a dollar.

23:05.716 --> 23:07.581
- Okay, there it is.
- Good. Okay, great.

23:07.752 --> 23:09.219
I'm really very sorry about that.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.411
Thank you.

23:10.588 --> 23:12.453
You don't have to mention this
to Mr. Fletcher.

23:12.623 --> 23:14.215
- Give me my dollar.
- You can have it.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.451
Okay, not... Not a problem.
I'm sorry about that.

23:16.627 --> 23:18.720
- Uh-huh.
- All right, I got these two.

23:18.896 --> 23:21.296
Okay, that's... Okay, not a problem.

23:30.808 --> 23:32.435
Stop.

23:39.450 --> 23:41.816
No! No!

23:42.253 --> 23:44.380
All the tapes are blank.

23:44.555 --> 23:48.855
The movies, all of them, they're all...

23:49.026 --> 23:51.756
They're all gone,
all the tapes are gone.

23:51.929 --> 23:53.294
Where?

23:56.367 --> 23:58.426
Mr. Fletcher's gonna flip
when he sees this.

23:58.602 --> 24:01.799
You know that look he has on his face.
He's gonna be so disappointed...

24:01.972 --> 24:04.406
...that he left me with this responsibility.
Look, look, look.

24:04.575 --> 24:06.406
What the duck?
All the tapes are like this.

24:06.577 --> 24:08.442
All the tapes.
I tried every tape on this table.

24:08.612 --> 24:11.376
Relax. It's the TV, Mike.

24:11.549 --> 24:12.777
The TV's malfunctioning.

24:12.950 --> 24:15.646
- It's not all the videotapes. Think about it.
- Well, show me what it's doing.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.788
Show me how... What was that?

24:17.955 --> 24:21.516
Maybe that's the picture coming back.
Wait, do... What was that?

24:22.560 --> 24:24.551
Why is it doing that?

24:26.030 --> 24:28.362
Does that happen when you do it?

24:28.532 --> 24:30.932
No, it hasn't done that at all... Wow.

24:33.504 --> 24:35.301
What is that?

24:35.473 --> 24:37.498
Why is it doing that when you do that?

24:37.675 --> 24:38.972
What is wrong with you?

24:40.144 --> 24:42.203
You're magnetized.

24:42.379 --> 24:43.937
You...

24:44.114 --> 24:46.878
You erased these tapes.

24:47.051 --> 24:48.109
It's you.

24:48.285 --> 24:51.345
What happened
during the sabotage attempt, Jerry?

24:54.425 --> 24:59.692
I didn't sabotage the power plant,
the power plant sabotaged me.

24:59.864 --> 25:02.594
Really? The power plant
sabotaged you?

25:02.766 --> 25:04.529
- I'm gonna sabotage you.
- I'm magnetized!

25:04.702 --> 25:06.727
I'm not gonna get... Are you serious?

25:06.904 --> 25:09.236
Sabotage a power plant?
What are you, a superhero?

25:09.406 --> 25:10.771
Don't do this, man.

25:10.941 --> 25:13.068
You were right.

25:13.244 --> 25:15.644
I did have the <i>Driving Miss Daisy</i> tape
at home.

25:15.813 --> 25:17.542
Oh, good, that's really good.

25:21.952 --> 25:24.648
Thank you for returning the tape.

25:24.822 --> 25:26.312
I like your ensemble.

25:27.291 --> 25:30.783
Listen, I wanna rent <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

25:30.961 --> 25:32.326
<i>Ghostbusters.</i>

25:33.397 --> 25:34.557
Is that out?

25:35.199 --> 25:36.427
Isn't that a horror movie?

25:36.600 --> 25:37.624
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:37.801 --> 25:40.099
- That could be interesting.
- Miss Falafelwicz...

25:40.271 --> 25:43.900
- It's <i>Falewicz.</i>
- It's actually got a lot of nudity in it.

25:44.074 --> 25:46.042
- So...
- Oh, you. Come on.

25:46.210 --> 25:47.302
You're pulling my leg.

25:47.478 --> 25:49.605
We're right in the middle
of reorganizing.

25:49.780 --> 25:52.715
That's why all the tapes are there like that.
We're getting the stock together.

25:52.883 --> 25:54.942
I think you should know
that Mr. Fletcher...

25:55.119 --> 25:59.055
...calls me every night at 8 p.m.
just to see how I am.

25:59.223 --> 26:04.126
And I think he would not be pleased
to see his business go off the deep end...

26:04.295 --> 26:08.061
...because some sort of boxing match
going on on his premises.

26:08.232 --> 26:09.699
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I don't think so.

26:09.867 --> 26:11.391
We're not boxing.

26:11.569 --> 26:14.561
It's just... You know, it's just buddies...

26:14.738 --> 26:17.969
...just, you know, horsing around.

26:18.142 --> 26:19.871
- Yeah, well...
- It's nothing, just boys.

26:20.044 --> 26:23.104
What I can do is that I can get that to you
first thing tomorrow morning.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.838
No, I don't think so. Uh-uh.

26:25.015 --> 26:27.279
I'm gonna come back before 7,
when you close.

26:27.451 --> 26:29.578
- Oh, okay.
- And I really strongly suggest...

26:29.753 --> 26:34.349
...that you get this place in order fast.
- Okay, well...

26:35.492 --> 26:37.858
- Have a good day.
- Yeah.

26:42.366 --> 26:45.824
She's a communist.
I don't like commies.

26:47.705 --> 26:51.334
- I gotta get some rest, I still feel sick.
- Yeah?

26:51.508 --> 26:52.907
Yeah, me too.

26:53.077 --> 26:54.237
What time is it?

26:56.313 --> 26:57.507
This is a message is for Mark.

26:57.681 --> 27:00.081
I was wondering if you had a copy
of <i>Ghostbusters?</i>

27:00.250 --> 27:02.241
Hey, bro, is Pablo around?

27:02.419 --> 27:04.011
I'm under a little bit of pressure here.

27:04.188 --> 27:07.282
Do you have a copy of <i>Ghostbusters</i>
that I could...? That I could borrow?

27:07.458 --> 27:09.392
You do? Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

27:09.560 --> 27:13.519
No, no, no.
Because I don't need it on DVD.

27:13.697 --> 27:16.825
I need it on... I need it on VHS.

27:17.001 --> 27:20.334
Yeah, well, you know,
they said that about laser discs too so...

27:20.504 --> 27:22.096
Okay, take care.

27:22.272 --> 27:24.069
Shit.

27:45.629 --> 27:49.065
A clear image,
even in the middle of the day.

27:49.233 --> 27:50.860
It's as powerful as the sun.

27:51.035 --> 27:53.765
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry.

27:53.937 --> 27:56.804
Do you...?
Do you have <i>Ghostbusters</i> on VHS?

27:56.974 --> 27:59.602
There's no VHS here, buddy.

28:00.377 --> 28:02.368
Ho, ho, ho, Little Mikey?

28:03.113 --> 28:04.876
What are you doing here, man?

28:05.049 --> 28:07.449
- You know me?
- Of course I know you, Mike.

28:07.618 --> 28:09.051
Oh, I get it.

28:09.219 --> 28:11.847
Old man Fletcher sent you by here
to get a movie that he's missing.

28:12.022 --> 28:14.286
He's too embarrassed to get it himself.
Ain't that right?

28:14.458 --> 28:16.085
- Now, ain't that right, Little Mikey?
- No, no.

28:16.260 --> 28:17.488
- Yeah, that's right!
- No.

28:17.661 --> 28:19.458
- Okay.
- I call it like I see it.

28:19.630 --> 28:22.224
- All right, you take... You take care.
- I got you.

28:27.438 --> 28:30.430
Tell me the truth, doc.
How long have I got left?

28:30.607 --> 28:31.733
Ten minutes.

28:32.309 --> 28:33.833
Ten minutes?

28:34.011 --> 28:36.275
This should help.

29:10.247 --> 29:13.239
<i>Miss Kobayashi had a fever of...</i>

29:13.417 --> 29:16.750
I'm Bill Murray, you're everybody else.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.115
What, are you crazy?
She's never gonna buy it.

29:19.289 --> 29:23.885
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She doesn't know
what the movie's supposed to look like.

29:24.061 --> 29:27.462
The only thing that she knows
is what's on this box.

29:27.631 --> 29:29.326
She's never seen it before.

29:29.500 --> 29:33.596
If we stay 10 feet away from the camera
she's not gonna <i>recognize</i> us.

29:33.771 --> 29:36.763
We come up with some special effects,
we do it ourselves.

29:36.940 --> 29:39.101
She's gonna be back in, like,
two hours and 45 minutes.

29:39.276 --> 29:41.506
She's on the phone with Fletcher
every night.

29:41.678 --> 29:43.475
The first scene is at the library.

29:43.647 --> 29:46.241
And take that thing off, please.

29:46.717 --> 29:48.207
Okay.

29:54.091 --> 29:56.616
And action.

29:59.062 --> 30:00.723
- Start over. Sorry, cut.
- What?

30:00.898 --> 30:02.024
I looked right in the lens.

30:02.199 --> 30:03.257
- We gotta start over.
- We can't start over.

30:03.433 --> 30:05.401
- I looked right in the lens.
- You just have to do one good take.

30:05.569 --> 30:07.332
All right? Don't...
Listen, what you're doing is good.

30:07.504 --> 30:08.562
- I am doing good, right?
- Just do the same thing.

30:08.739 --> 30:10.229
- Yeah, just do the same thing.
- Am I doing great?

30:10.407 --> 30:12.238
- You're doing great, but don't look...
- All right, you're doing good too...

30:12.409 --> 30:15.207
...with the cinematography.
- All right, thanks. Okay, good.

30:15.379 --> 30:16.505
Go check the cards.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.875
Check the cards.

30:20.450 --> 30:23.010
You're doing... That's good, that's right.
That's great. That's good.

30:23.187 --> 30:25.621
- Put your head down, put your head down.
- I can't see.

30:25.789 --> 30:27.723
Go back to the shelf.

30:29.326 --> 30:32.386
Suspecting nothing, and ghosts.
Ghosts.

30:43.774 --> 30:47.403
<i>When you're walking down the street</i>
<i>And you see a little ghost</i>

30:47.578 --> 30:51.014
<i>What you gonna</i>
<i>Do about Ghostbusters?</i>

30:51.181 --> 30:55.083
- What? What? What is that?
- That's the <i>Ghostbusters</i> theme song.

30:55.686 --> 30:57.654
- No.
- I'm pretty sure it is.

31:12.269 --> 31:14.134
- About this stuff...
- We've got one right there.

31:14.304 --> 31:16.272
Let's get a closer look.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.739
Hey, have you talked to Elvis lately?

31:22.346 --> 31:25.509
We're moving on to stage two.
We can capture her.

31:25.682 --> 31:28.651
We have the megapixels.
You just have to stay with me, okay?

31:28.819 --> 31:29.843
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:38.962 --> 31:40.088
Excuse me.

31:42.065 --> 31:46.263
We got her. We did it,
because we're Ghostbusters.

31:46.436 --> 31:47.528
- All right.
- Pound it.

31:47.704 --> 31:50.639
I'm in the hotel reading area
for children...

31:50.807 --> 31:53.037
...and I'm getting a lot of creepy vibes.

31:53.210 --> 31:55.405
I think I did hear something.

31:55.579 --> 31:57.979
You heard something?
Stay where you are, I'm on my way.

32:10.794 --> 32:13.422
I got... I got slimed.

32:18.835 --> 32:22.396
Okay, Wilson, go now. Wilson, now!

32:22.572 --> 32:24.096
- Wilson?
- Should I come in now?

32:24.274 --> 32:26.401
- Yes, for duck's sake, now, Wilson.
- I wasn't sure.

32:26.576 --> 32:31.536
If you or any of your family
have seen ectoplasmic apparitions..

32:31.715 --> 32:34.047
...or heard funny noises in your attic...

32:34.217 --> 32:35.548
Call Ghostbusters.

32:35.719 --> 32:38.119
We're fully staffed and ready
24 hours a day...

32:38.288 --> 32:40.415
...to fulfill your supernatural needs.

32:40.590 --> 32:43.115
- We're ready to believe you.
- We're ready to believe you.

32:43.293 --> 32:45.352
Look at the refrigerator.

32:48.131 --> 32:51.623
Hello, I need Ghostbusters, fast.
There's a strange alien in my refrigerator.

32:55.872 --> 32:58.898
- Okay, go.
- Rock 'n' roll. How does it look?

32:59.076 --> 33:01.044
- Amazing, very real.
- Hey, come on. Yeah.

33:01.211 --> 33:03.805
Okay, now, the next scene
is the car screeching through the night.

33:03.981 --> 33:05.175
- Okay.
- Well, not night...

33:05.349 --> 33:07.715
...because we're not in the night.
We gotta just go with the day.

33:07.884 --> 33:09.852
No, no, no. All dramatic scenes
are shot at night.

33:10.020 --> 33:11.988
You got... You gotta...
You gotta shoot it at night.

33:12.155 --> 33:15.318
- The day is fine. What are you doing?
- And then, you also have to wet the floor.

33:15.492 --> 33:16.925
- You wet the floor.
- Would you stop?

33:17.094 --> 33:18.823
That's just a waste of water.
Would you stop?

33:18.996 --> 33:20.827
Mike, I'm not gonna botch this job, man.

33:20.998 --> 33:23.364
If you wanna do it in the day,
you'll find somebody else.

33:23.533 --> 33:26.866
Miss <i>Falewicz</i> will be back
in less than an hour. We don't have time.

33:27.037 --> 33:29.699
We just need a minimum amount
of professionalism.

33:29.873 --> 33:32.137
I can shoot a night scene in the day,
give me the camera.

33:32.309 --> 33:33.674
- No.
- Give me the camera.

33:33.844 --> 33:35.243
Let me just show you how you...

33:36.747 --> 33:40.513
You... You cannot touch the camera. You're
gonna erase everything that we've done.

33:40.684 --> 33:44.415
Mike, look on the side of the camera.
There's a button that says, "negative."

33:44.588 --> 33:47.455
See? Makes it look like nighttime
in the day. Am I right?

33:47.624 --> 33:49.455
- Oh, there it goes.
- Thank you, you're welcome.

33:49.626 --> 33:52.891
Your face is negative, though. Don't.

33:53.063 --> 33:55.258
- There's something we can do about that.
- What?

33:55.432 --> 33:57.798
- Okay, go.
- All right.

33:59.102 --> 34:01.730
- Close your eyes.
- You're telling me that now?

34:01.905 --> 34:03.998
Sorry. Good job.

34:05.142 --> 34:10.409
Gotta run,
got a date with a Ghostbuster.

34:15.385 --> 34:16.612
Busting makes me feel good.

34:17.888 --> 34:20.880
Okay, Wilson.

34:21.858 --> 34:25.225
- Ghostbusters, open the door!
- Wait, wait, do it one more time.

34:25.395 --> 34:26.828
Ghostbusters, open the...

34:26.996 --> 34:29.898
Are you the Gatekeeper
or the Keymaster?

34:30.067 --> 34:33.230
Are you the Keymaster?
I want your key inside of me.

34:33.402 --> 34:35.667
- Are you menstruating?
- That's not from the...

34:35.839 --> 34:38.433
Back off, I'm the scientist here.

34:38.608 --> 34:41.132
I'm gonna open that refrigerator door.

34:45.949 --> 34:50.215
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

34:50.387 --> 34:51.820
We ionized it.

34:51.987 --> 34:54.980
It was a complete particle reversal.

34:55.625 --> 34:56.649
Can I go now?

34:56.827 --> 34:59.489
As the 100-foot marshmallow man
tried to kill them...

34:59.663 --> 35:05.499
...they decided to reverse reality
by crossing their beams.

35:05.669 --> 35:09.332
Run, everyone, run.
There's a Stay Puft Marsh...

35:12.109 --> 35:13.736
Okay.

35:13.910 --> 35:17.107
- Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.
- See you on the other side.

35:17.681 --> 35:22.675
The end. Starring Bill Murray
and other actors.

35:22.853 --> 35:26.755

35:26.923 --> 35:29.255
<i>Ghostbusters</i>

35:29.759 --> 35:32.592
Wait, wait. Miss <i>Falewicz,</i>
Miss <i>Falewicz.</i> Hi. Hi.

35:32.762 --> 35:35.322
- I was waiting for you.
- Yeah, I'm here.

35:35.499 --> 35:38.798
By the way, it looks a load better.
Big improvement.

35:38.969 --> 35:41.836
- Oh, yeah. We were just...
- Mr. Fletcher will be pleased.

35:42.005 --> 35:44.166
Yeah, we were doing...
We were doing inventory here.

35:44.341 --> 35:48.505
A nice and tidy house.
First step to combating depression:

35:48.678 --> 35:51.647
- To have an optimistic view of the future.
- Hey, that sounds...

35:51.815 --> 35:53.942
You know what I do
whenever I'm feeling depressed?

35:54.117 --> 35:56.142
- Oh, what's that?
- I clean my house.

35:56.319 --> 35:58.549
- Oh, really?
- Honest to God, it clears the mind.

35:58.722 --> 36:01.486
You'll see, in the morning
when the sun comes in.

36:01.658 --> 36:04.388
- Uh-huh.
- Number one step for fighting depression.

36:04.561 --> 36:07.997
Here it is, Miss <i>Falewicz,</i> there you go.
<i>Ghostbusters</i> like you asked for.

36:08.165 --> 36:09.996
<i>When you're walking down the street</i>

36:10.167 --> 36:12.067
- You know what, I...
<i>- And you see a little ghost</i>

36:12.235 --> 36:14.999
- All right.
- I have a... I have a...

36:15.172 --> 36:16.662
I was gonna say I have a...

36:16.840 --> 36:19.308
- What are you doing? I have a method.
<i>- What you gonna do?</i>

36:19.476 --> 36:22.343
- A foolproof method for fighting depression.
<i>- Ghostbusters</i>

36:22.512 --> 36:25.310
You get a notebook
and you, like, put four columns in it.

36:25.482 --> 36:27.177
- And the first column is...
<i>- And you see a little ghost</i>

36:27.350 --> 36:28.612
...the effort you believe...
<i>- What you gonna do?</i>

36:28.785 --> 36:30.514
...the dreaded task will take...
<i>- Ghostbusters</i>

36:30.687 --> 36:32.848
Tell me the other two tomorrow,
because I'm really...

36:33.023 --> 36:35.355
- Good movie you got there.
- I'm focused on those first two.

36:35.525 --> 36:37.755
Wait a sec, 1 dollar, one tape,
one night, right?

36:37.928 --> 36:40.055
- No, Miss <i>Falewicz,</i> it's not a problem.
- I'm in it.

36:40.230 --> 36:42.130
- It's okay. That's on us today.
- Really?

36:42.299 --> 36:43.323
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

36:43.500 --> 36:47.527
- You're welcome. Take care.
- Enjoy the movie.

36:49.940 --> 36:53.239
We should've had, like, a premiere
of that thing or something.

36:54.444 --> 36:56.105
- What?
- What are you talking about, "what"?

36:56.279 --> 36:58.338
She's not supposed to know
that we're in the movie...

36:58.515 --> 37:00.380
...because we're not in <i>Ghostbusters.</i>
- Yeah? Maybe I want her to know...

37:00.550 --> 37:02.677
- Maybe I am in <i>Ghostbusters.</i>
- Why is it...?

37:02.852 --> 37:05.286
- Because I'm proud of my work.
- Oh, you're...

37:05.455 --> 37:08.288
- Oh, my God.
- Mike, you have zero ambition.

37:08.458 --> 37:10.585
- What's...?
- That's your problem.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.127
You're gonna be stuck in this dump
for the rest of your life.

37:14.297 --> 37:15.958
Good night.

37:17.601 --> 37:19.796
Wh...? What? What? What's a dump?

37:20.270 --> 37:21.862
What's a dump?
My... My shop is a dump?

37:22.038 --> 37:23.232
You live in a junkyard.

37:23.406 --> 37:26.864
Not just the store,
the whole city is a swamp.

37:27.043 --> 37:31.002
- It's a swamp now?
- Yeah, a dump swamp.

37:31.848 --> 37:34.180
When you get stuck here,
you're stuck for life.

37:34.351 --> 37:39.220
Come on, Mike, what is so great
about this town? Huh?

37:40.123 --> 37:42.819
- The people.
- The people?

37:42.993 --> 37:45.962
You're gonna make me cry.
The people.

37:46.129 --> 37:49.565
The only reason there's anybody here
is because they have nowhere to go.

37:49.733 --> 37:53.362
Why don't you...? Why don't you
go somewhere, <i>Mr.</i> "Junkman"?

37:53.536 --> 37:56.733
We got a customer. We got a customer.

37:56.906 --> 37:59.397
- Mr... Mr. Jack.
- Hi, how you doing?

37:59.576 --> 38:01.771
Yeah, actually, we're closed.

38:01.945 --> 38:05.005
- I'm actually open later...
- It'll just take a moment, guys.

38:05.181 --> 38:07.081
<i>- Rush Hour 2,</i> that's all.
- Excellent choice.

38:07.250 --> 38:10.515
It's out. But you come back tomorrow,
and I can... I can get you <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

38:10.687 --> 38:13.212
Seen <i>it. Jaws?</i>

38:13.390 --> 38:16.086
- Whoa, what the duck?
- Whoa, what was that?

38:19.863 --> 38:22.388
How about <i>Towering Inferno?</i>

38:22.565 --> 38:24.328
- I saw it.
- Mr. Jack...

38:24.501 --> 38:26.025
...if you just come back tomorrow.

38:26.202 --> 38:28.898
I... I'll take care of all of that tomorrow,
okay, Mr. Jack?

38:29.072 --> 38:32.269
I can't believe you don't have <i>Rush Hour 2.</i>
I'm gonna go to West Coast Video.

38:32.442 --> 38:34.467
No, you... No, you're not.
Dude, you'd better...

38:34.644 --> 38:37.511
You don't do that, you...
Have some morals.

38:37.681 --> 38:40.946
Just wait till tomorrow.
I'll have <i>Rush Hour 2 tomorrow.</i>

38:41.117 --> 38:42.516
Good!

38:53.263 --> 38:55.163
Lee, I'm coming.

38:58.601 --> 39:00.501
I'm taking the stairs.

39:01.104 --> 39:02.366
Lee.

39:02.539 --> 39:03.597
Lee.

39:03.773 --> 39:04.797
Cut, that was great.

39:19.923 --> 39:21.550
Lee!

39:21.725 --> 39:24.853
- Over here.
- Lee, what you doing down there, man?

39:25.028 --> 39:26.859
Carter, behind you.
Behind you, look out.

39:32.268 --> 39:35.669
Lee, this Chinese bamboo
ain't gonna hold.

39:35.839 --> 39:40.640
Don't worry, Carter,
Chinese bamboo, very strong.

39:47.550 --> 39:52.180
This Chinese bamboo ain't strong.
I can't believe you got me out here.

39:52.355 --> 39:56.223
Forget about the bamboo.
We gotta go solve a crime.

39:58.762 --> 40:01.253
Go in for the kiss now, Jerry.
Go in for the kiss.

40:01.431 --> 40:03.797
Go in for the kiss now.
Go now, kiss him now.

40:03.967 --> 40:05.366
Hold on.

40:06.035 --> 40:08.595
Why do I have to kiss Wilson?

40:08.772 --> 40:10.797
- She's the bad guy, right?
- Right.

40:10.974 --> 40:13.636
She's got the detonator...
He's got the detonator in his hand.

40:13.810 --> 40:15.437
You have the bomb in your mouth.

40:15.612 --> 40:17.876
You have to press it against her
to keep her from blowing your head off.

40:18.047 --> 40:19.742
- I'm not kissing Wilson.
- It's not a kiss!

40:19.916 --> 40:22.817
I don't wanna kiss Wilson.

40:24.521 --> 40:27.081
We've been working with him all day.
We can't replace him.

40:27.257 --> 40:28.622
- Could I just say something?
- What?

40:28.792 --> 40:30.453
I quit.

40:31.127 --> 40:33.960
- Amateurs. I hate this movie.
- Wilson...

40:34.130 --> 40:35.791
Thanks, good work today.

40:36.599 --> 40:37.691
Mike.

40:37.867 --> 40:40.062
Mike, Mike. Listen to me.

40:40.236 --> 40:42.932
Maybe you can understand that
I don't want the whole neighborhood...

40:43.106 --> 40:47.202
...to think I'm having a homosexual,
interracial relationship with my mechanic.

40:47.377 --> 40:48.605
Oh. Okay.

40:48.778 --> 40:52.043
- So the interracial is the issue.
- Okay, forget about the interracial thing...

40:52.215 --> 40:56.811
...but kissing my mechanic is disturbing
and inappropriate.

40:56.986 --> 40:59.284
He could sue me
for sexual harassment.

40:59.456 --> 41:01.117
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, come on.

41:01.291 --> 41:04.317
Mike, Mike, Mike. I got a better idea.

41:04.794 --> 41:06.421
Follow me.

41:07.130 --> 41:10.395
Right, yeah,
There's a stain on this sweater.

41:10.567 --> 41:12.296
- Okay. Okay.
- You see what I'm talking about?

41:12.469 --> 41:14.266
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.

41:14.437 --> 41:18.305
We're moviemakers and we're making
a movie around the corner.

41:18.475 --> 41:20.807
And we have a kissing scene,
and we need an actress...

41:20.977 --> 41:22.808
...and you are amazing.

41:22.979 --> 41:25.812
I'm sorry, I can't leave the store.

41:25.982 --> 41:28.348
I have work to do, but my sister can.

41:28.518 --> 41:30.486
- Alma.
- What?

41:30.653 --> 41:31.677
Come here.

41:32.655 --> 41:35.818
These guys are making a film
around the corner. They need a girl.

41:35.992 --> 41:37.482
What kind of film are you making?

41:37.660 --> 41:40.595
Actually it's like comedy,
action, adventure.

41:40.763 --> 41:43.425
- Like, the types of movies, you know...
- I don't think you understand...

41:43.600 --> 41:44.965
- Like what kind?
...what we're offering you, though.

41:45.134 --> 41:48.433
- We want you to be a movie star.
- I told you I have to stay here.

41:48.605 --> 41:51.335
I can't leave, but she should go,
she's a really good actress.

41:51.508 --> 41:54.341
- I was in the school play.
- She was a fridge.

41:54.511 --> 41:56.536
- A refrigerator?
- Yeah.

41:56.713 --> 41:58.908
So check it out.
Okay, so I'm standing in the kitchen...

41:59.082 --> 42:00.174
...and this is my door.

42:00.350 --> 42:03.842
And then I had, like, to close my eye
like this, and I go like that.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.079
- Okay, we're gonna take a quick meeting.
- That was the light.

42:06.256 --> 42:07.450
- A quick producers' meeting.
- It's the light.

42:07.624 --> 42:09.216
- You got it.
- She's horrible.

42:09.392 --> 42:11.690
- What's the matter? She's...
- She's the worst actress I've ever seen.

42:11.861 --> 42:13.192
Listen to me, I know a woman...

42:13.363 --> 42:15.593
...who works across the street
at the diner, she's per...

42:15.765 --> 42:19.030
Are you gonna kiss her or Wilson?
Because that's what it is at this point.

42:19.202 --> 42:21.261
- You gonna kiss her?
- I hate you right now.

42:21.437 --> 42:23.234
Okay, we did it.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.505
- Guess what, we just had a meeting.
- Yeah?

42:25.675 --> 42:27.472
- You got the part.
- I got the part?

42:27.644 --> 42:29.578
- Oh, yeah.
- So we should... We should go now...

42:29.746 --> 42:30.804
...because we're actually...

42:30.980 --> 42:32.004
- We're shooting right now.
- Thank you so much.

42:32.181 --> 42:34.615
It's gonna be fun.
We're gonna makes some movies.

42:34.784 --> 42:36.342
I'm sorry, can...? Can...? Can...?

42:36.519 --> 42:37.543
- Is this yours?
- Yes, it is.

42:37.720 --> 42:40.018
- Can we use this just really quickly?
- No, no, no.

42:40.189 --> 42:43.056
- She just dropped this off to be cleaned.
- Just really, really quickly.

42:43.226 --> 42:44.693
- It'll be all right.
- You don't have to do that.

42:44.861 --> 42:47.091
We'll bring it back.
We'll make sure it's in fine condition.

42:47.263 --> 42:48.355
- What's your name?
- Ann.

42:48.531 --> 42:49.725
Ann. Miss Ann. Thank you so much.

42:49.899 --> 42:51.628
We gotta make sure
she gets a wardrobe credit.

42:51.801 --> 42:54.201
She will get a credit for sure,
and then some.

42:54.370 --> 42:55.462
- I'm gonna be thinking about...
- Thank you.

42:55.638 --> 42:57.265
...parts for you in the future
of our films.

42:57.440 --> 42:58.805
Not you, however. You blew it.

42:58.975 --> 43:00.567
I wanted to make you Marilyn Monroe.

43:00.743 --> 43:02.438
- Now you're just gonna be the cleaner.
- Okay, let's go. Thank you.

43:02.612 --> 43:06.309
- Thank you for letting us use your sister.
- Alma, keep your tongue in your mouth.

43:06.482 --> 43:08.211
- We're gonna go down here.
- It's <i>Rush Hour 2...</i>

43:08.384 --> 43:09.976
...and you're gonna play the girl.

43:10.153 --> 43:11.916
Action, guys.

43:14.324 --> 43:15.655
What...?

43:16.059 --> 43:17.458
- Oh, damn. Damn.
- What was that?

43:18.761 --> 43:20.058
Hold still.

43:20.663 --> 43:21.891
- Stop.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

43:22.065 --> 43:26.092
He got exposed to radioactive waves.

43:26.269 --> 43:27.896
Are you radioactive?

43:28.071 --> 43:30.062
Is it contagious?
Am I gonna be radioactive now?

43:30.239 --> 43:34.073
Not radioactive! Magnetized!

43:34.243 --> 43:35.267
Give me my bottle.

43:36.512 --> 43:40.004
I'm sorry, we didn't have a chance to...
It's not contagious.

43:40.617 --> 43:43.211
I'm just gonna check...
Sorry. You're fine.

43:43.386 --> 43:45.115
- This came out pretty good.
- I'm fine?

43:45.288 --> 43:47.051
- Not magnetized.
- Uh-huh, yeah. Okay, good.

43:47.223 --> 43:49.748
- Not magnetized.
- What about your friend?

43:49.926 --> 43:51.018
Huh?

43:52.195 --> 43:54.629
Hey, Jerry. I'm really sorry
about hurting your feelings.

43:54.797 --> 43:57.357
I just, like... I got really scared
about the radioactive stuff.

43:57.534 --> 44:00.128
Yeah, I know.
It's my fault, I should've warned you.

44:00.303 --> 44:01.702
Yeah.

44:04.974 --> 44:06.168
Is that you?

44:07.043 --> 44:09.409
- I took the whole bottle.
- Why would you do that, Jerry?

44:09.579 --> 44:12.173
I just wanted to go to sleep.
Am I gonna die?

44:12.348 --> 44:16.250
Yeah, it's aspirin, not sleeping pills,
you dummy. Why be a dummy?

44:16.419 --> 44:18.853
You are not going to die, okay?

44:19.022 --> 44:20.887
- If you do what I say, okay?
- What's happening?

44:21.057 --> 44:22.456
I need you to go to the bathroom...

44:22.625 --> 44:24.525
...get me a bucket full of salt and water,
right now.

44:24.694 --> 44:27.424
- Salt, salt.
- Okay?

44:27.597 --> 44:29.189
Just sit down, relax.

44:29.999 --> 44:32.058
- I'm gonna die.
- No, you're not gonna die, I promise.

44:32.235 --> 44:33.964
- I've done it before.
- I have a good future.

44:34.137 --> 44:37.436
Here, here. Drink it, drink it.

44:39.976 --> 44:41.466
Good.

44:42.545 --> 44:45.275
- You okay?
- That was good.

44:45.448 --> 44:48.542
Hey, look at me, I'm doing good.

44:48.718 --> 44:49.980
Oh, that's me.

44:52.589 --> 44:55.149
Oh, not again.

44:55.992 --> 44:58.893
Why does he have to puke
outside of the shop every time?

44:59.062 --> 45:00.996
Oh, good, now he's gonna
puke out all the bad stuff.

45:01.164 --> 45:03.632
- You see?
- But in front of the shop?

45:04.734 --> 45:06.395
Hi. Sorry.

45:08.338 --> 45:09.930
Wait, what's he doing now?

45:12.709 --> 45:15.940
Oh, nice, nice. Pee.

45:16.112 --> 45:18.103
- You guys are so weird.
- It all came out in my pee.

45:18.281 --> 45:19.646
Yeah.

45:20.350 --> 45:22.181
Is his pee making it do that?

45:24.721 --> 45:26.052
Thank God for my bladder.

45:26.222 --> 45:28.315
Okay, good. Would you just finish
and come inside?

45:28.491 --> 45:30.789
Alma, I owe you one.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.588
Let's test it out. Let's test it out.

45:33.763 --> 45:35.958
Let's test it out.
Is it warping the image still?

45:36.132 --> 45:37.997
- No. No.
- No? No?

45:38.167 --> 45:40.829
- It worked. It's working.
- I'm demagnetized, you're a genius.

45:41.004 --> 45:42.335
- Thanks to me.
- You saved my life.

45:42.505 --> 45:45.167
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mr. Jack.

45:45.341 --> 45:47.332
- What are you looking at?
- Oh, nothing.

45:47.510 --> 45:50.001
We were just closing up, actually.

45:50.179 --> 45:52.647
Yeah, so there it is.

45:52.815 --> 45:55.875
I have to pay in mostly pennies.
That's okay?

45:56.052 --> 45:57.713
- Fine. That's... That's okay.
- Thank you.

45:57.887 --> 45:59.047
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the movie.

45:59.222 --> 46:00.655
Your pennies are always good here.

46:00.823 --> 46:02.688
I'm gonna enjoy it, thank you.

46:02.859 --> 46:03.917
Good night.

46:04.093 --> 46:06.254
- Enjoy the movie?
- Yeah, enjoy the movie.

46:06.429 --> 46:08.021
We worked hard on it.
It's gonna be good.

46:08.197 --> 46:11.098
Yo, we gotta find new tapes.
We're gonna get caught.

46:11.267 --> 46:12.564
- We can't keep doing this.
- What are you talking about?

46:12.769 --> 46:13.827
It's going fine. So far, so good.

46:14.003 --> 46:17.769
What? When Miss <i>Falewicz</i>
sees <i>"Ghostbusters"?</i>

46:17.940 --> 46:20.738
- Our version is better than the original.
- She's gonna say something...

46:20.910 --> 46:24.539
...to Mr. Fletcher. First of all,
our version is only 20 minutes.

46:24.714 --> 46:27.581
Yeah, but 20 minutes,
it's all the brain can concentrate for.

46:27.750 --> 46:29.911
It's the perfect duration.
It's a biological fact.

46:30.086 --> 46:31.348
- I study this, I know.
- Yeah.

46:31.521 --> 46:34.786
And besides, Miss <i>Falewicz</i> has never seen
a science-fiction movie before.

46:34.957 --> 46:38.256
She might think all of them are 20 minutes
long. And isn't she a little kooky?

46:38.428 --> 46:40.521
She probably won't even <i>recognize</i> us.

46:44.334 --> 46:46.632
Y'all need to chill out, all right?

46:48.271 --> 46:49.329
Craig?

46:50.473 --> 46:52.373
- What's up, old lady?
- Yo, come on in, guys.

46:52.542 --> 46:54.703
Yo, Craig. What's up, man?

46:59.115 --> 47:01.447
Dude, you gotta check this out, man.

47:01.617 --> 47:05.109
My auntie got this
from Fats' video store.

47:05.288 --> 47:06.721
This is <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

47:06.889 --> 47:08.686
- Roshambo.
- Water.

47:08.858 --> 47:10.348
- Laser.
- Water.

47:10.526 --> 47:13.188
- Whoa. Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

47:13.363 --> 47:15.661
Miss <i>Falewicz</i> gave it to her nephew.

47:16.733 --> 47:18.758
It looks like they were disappointed
with the video.

47:18.935 --> 47:20.800
- Come on, guys.
- Do they have guns?

47:20.970 --> 47:24.269
I can clearly see you
hiding behind the counter.

47:26.776 --> 47:29.301
We was closed,
something's wrong with these lights.

47:29.479 --> 47:30.503
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

47:31.180 --> 47:33.171
Y'all open now.

47:38.988 --> 47:41.752
That wasn't bad. What else y'all got?

47:41.924 --> 47:44.119
- The whole store.
- No. No.

47:44.293 --> 47:47.262
We actually...
We only have <i>Rush Hour 2.</i>

47:47.430 --> 47:50.263
No, man, he said the whole store.

47:50.433 --> 47:52.264
- Why you lie to me, man?
- I'm not lying.

47:52.435 --> 47:53.925
Guys, make your choice.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.538
- What is wrong with you?
- It just came out.

48:02.278 --> 48:04.007
What you got?

48:04.180 --> 48:05.807
Right. Yeah, that's for...

48:05.982 --> 48:09.213
Hey, man, hand me one of them
little mint jump off, right there.

48:09.385 --> 48:12.183
We'd love to rent you out
these videos today...

48:12.355 --> 48:15.051
...but Mr. Fletcher, right, he called.

48:15.224 --> 48:17.158
- Oh, yeah.
- We got the new policy.

48:17.326 --> 48:20.727
Two videos per day, per account, so...

48:20.897 --> 48:22.865
All right then,
let me open an account right now.

48:23.032 --> 48:24.727
Yeah, man. Sign away.

48:24.901 --> 48:28.735
We're gonna need your picture ID,
your phone bill...

48:28.905 --> 48:31.100
...your last three rent receipts,
your grades...

48:31.274 --> 48:33.174
...a letter from your mother
if you're a minor...

48:33.342 --> 48:35.742
...the last three countries
you visited prior to this trip...

48:35.912 --> 48:38.176
...your 10 favorite films
and your blood type.

48:38.347 --> 48:40.542
You know, you're real lucky
we don't beat up girls.

48:40.716 --> 48:42.411
- Word.
- For real.

48:42.585 --> 48:44.678
Except Craig's aunt.

48:44.854 --> 48:46.651
Shut up, stupid.

48:46.823 --> 48:49.053
We'll be back
with all the necessary documents.

48:49.525 --> 48:51.993
We still have two to choose, right?

48:52.161 --> 48:54.595
Here you go,
you pick two of those and we'll be...

48:54.764 --> 48:56.163
That's my choice.

48:56.332 --> 48:57.959
- You guys pick the other one.
- No, no, no.

48:58.134 --> 49:00.364
You get to pick your choice,
and we gotta fight over ours?

49:00.536 --> 49:01.969
- Yeah.
- What kind of democracy is that?

49:02.138 --> 49:04.800
Man, who told you
this was a democracy?

49:04.974 --> 49:06.737
Hey, hey, you guys, you guys.

49:06.909 --> 49:10.242
You guys, listen. You guys!

49:10.780 --> 49:14.739
Life without civilization is brutal...

49:14.917 --> 49:19.354
... nasty and short.

49:19.522 --> 49:20.921
If you're gonna come around here...

49:21.090 --> 49:25.789
...and spread <i>pizza</i>
all over the walls with gats...

49:25.962 --> 49:27.862
...you're gonna miss out
on some good movies.

49:28.030 --> 49:29.930
So this is what I'm saying.

49:30.099 --> 49:32.192
I'm gonna put all of these videos
into this bag.

49:32.702 --> 49:36.331
Alma, you're gonna pick out
two of these videos at random.

49:36.506 --> 49:38.997
Totally random.
It's the only way to do it civilized.

49:39.442 --> 49:43.902
And everyone will survive. Pick it out.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

49:44.714 --> 49:47.012
- Here they are.
- These are your choices.

49:47.183 --> 49:48.650
Done.

49:48.818 --> 49:50.217
How the hell?

49:50.386 --> 49:54.015
Okay, who's the baby
that picked <i>The Lion King?</i> Hm?

49:54.423 --> 49:56.015
Someone did.

50:00.062 --> 50:01.120
- What?
- Yeah.

50:01.297 --> 50:04.289
But we will have them for you
at 4 p.m. tomorrow...

50:04.467 --> 50:07.027
...as long as you give us
$20 right now.

50:07.203 --> 50:09.501
Twenty dollars?
Yo, that's a complete rip-off.

50:09.672 --> 50:12.607
No, no, no.
These are custom made. Sweded.

50:12.775 --> 50:16.871
- Sweded.
- It's a very rare type of video.

50:17.046 --> 50:19.071
- Swede? Like Sweden?
- Yeah, Sweded.

50:19.248 --> 50:23.184
- It's a country, not a verb.
- Exactly. That's why it's expensive.

50:23.352 --> 50:26.583
Because it's a faraway,
expensive country.

50:26.756 --> 50:28.053
- It's imported.
- Sweded.

50:29.926 --> 50:34.625
A toast. Twenty bucks in one day.
That's never happened at Be Kind Rewind.

50:34.797 --> 50:35.889
- That's never happened. Never.
- Never happened at all?

50:36.065 --> 50:38.556
- Nice with the civilization theory.
- Right?

50:38.734 --> 50:40.167
- I gotta say, that was nice.
- I pulled that out.

50:40.336 --> 50:42.463
I do some thinking at night.

50:42.638 --> 50:45.198
If I can't sleep,
I'm just thinking about stuff.

50:45.374 --> 50:47.842
- Who picked <i>The Lion King?</i>
- That's what I was wondering.

50:48.010 --> 50:51.275
The big guy, maybe.
One of those guys picked <i>The Lion King.</i>

50:51.447 --> 50:52.675
It was me.

50:52.848 --> 50:54.475
- You snuck it in there?
- Yeah.

50:54.650 --> 50:55.947
You're a badass.

50:56.118 --> 50:58.643
See, well, <i>Pocahontas</i> used to be,
like, my favorite movie, right?

50:58.821 --> 51:01.051
But then I couldn't find it
when you got the bag idea...

51:01.223 --> 51:02.918
...soI just picked <i>Lion King</i> instead.

51:03.092 --> 51:08.029
It is such a good movie too.
I cry every time when the father dies.

51:08.197 --> 51:11.291
Oh, man, I love <i>The Lion King</i> too.
It's my favorite picture, man.

51:12.001 --> 51:13.662
My mom loved it.

51:13.836 --> 51:15.303
- It's awesome.
- You like it too?

51:15.471 --> 51:17.371
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- It's deeply deep.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.098
- Oh, yeah.
- Because the uncle...

51:19.275 --> 51:22.039
...kills the nephew's father.
- His father...

51:22.211 --> 51:24.008
...which is his brother.
- That's his brother.

51:24.180 --> 51:27.707
He kills his own brother, right?
That's some heavy, Shapeskearian shit.

51:28.117 --> 51:29.414
What's funny?

51:29.585 --> 51:31.246
- Shape... Nothing.
- Well, you know...

51:31.420 --> 51:34.719
Does anybody have any ideas,
<i>Lion King lady...</i>

51:34.890 --> 51:38.485
...about how we're supposed to shoot
an animated film?

51:38.661 --> 51:42.927
Roar! I am the king!

51:43.099 --> 51:45.829
Roar! Jerry, I kind of see your head.

51:46.002 --> 51:47.196
- What?
- It doesn't look real.

51:47.370 --> 51:49.338
Well, Alma, stay on the voices.

51:49.505 --> 51:51.234
We'll be in charge
of the bodies and motion.

51:51.407 --> 51:52.669
- Okay.
- I need you to say this:

51:52.842 --> 51:56.209
<i>"I'm gonna piss on the graves
of your <i>ancestors. "</i></i>

51:56.379 --> 51:57.937
- It's important in the story, Alma.
- Don't say that.

51:58.114 --> 51:59.308
Roar!

51:59.482 --> 52:02.542
I'm going to piss
on the heads of your ancestors!

52:02.718 --> 52:04.618
No, wait. Hold on.
This is a children's movie.

52:04.787 --> 52:07.984
This is the sequel.
We're doing part two.

52:14.263 --> 52:15.890
Less choice...

52:16.065 --> 52:19.933
...more copies of the same movie.

52:20.803 --> 52:24.671
Simplified categorization of genre.

52:24.840 --> 52:25.932
Sir?

52:26.108 --> 52:27.132
Hi.

52:27.309 --> 52:32.042
Noticeable outfit
and big badge on employee.

52:32.214 --> 52:34.114
Sir, are you sure I can't help you?

52:34.283 --> 52:38.219
You've been here for the last two hours,
you can't seem to make up your mind.

52:39.288 --> 52:40.721
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

52:40.890 --> 52:43.950
Do you carry a copy
of <i>Stormy Weather?</i>

52:44.126 --> 52:46.356
- What?
- No pecific...

52:46.529 --> 52:51.466
...knowledge required.

52:52.234 --> 52:53.258
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

52:53.436 --> 52:55.063
Okay. Very helpful.

52:57.373 --> 52:58.465
- That's it.
- Shoot him, Robo.

52:58.641 --> 53:00.734
I'm taking you downtown.

53:00.910 --> 53:03.242
- I'm coming to get you now...
- Well, you're gonna get shot.

53:03.412 --> 53:05.380
...with my gun.

53:05.548 --> 53:07.140
And there's more
where that came from...

53:07.316 --> 53:08.908
- No!
...for you, cop lady.

53:11.387 --> 53:12.513
Y'all still shooting, man?

53:12.688 --> 53:13.712
- Yeah, we...
- Four o' clock.

53:13.889 --> 53:16.687
Y'all were supposed to be done.
I've been out there for 20 minutes.

53:16.859 --> 53:19.157
- Don't worry. I can handle this guy.
- No, no, I got it, man.

53:19.328 --> 53:21.023
- Let me show you how to do this, man.
- We almost done.

53:21.197 --> 53:24.997
I will shoot you
and I know robot karate.

53:25.167 --> 53:26.498
I got something for you, man.

53:26.669 --> 53:28.830
What do you think you're...?
I'll take you to the...

53:29.905 --> 53:31.202
- Robo!
- Yeah.

53:31.373 --> 53:33.773
- You want some? Yeah, you want some?
- No.

53:34.376 --> 53:36.173
- Stay back.
- I'm wounded!

53:36.345 --> 53:37.937
I'm giving you
till the count of three...

53:38.114 --> 53:39.775
...to drop your weapon.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

53:44.186 --> 53:46.484
That's not funny, y'all.

53:46.655 --> 53:47.883
- Cut.
- Whatever, y'all.

53:48.057 --> 53:50.958
- It's kind of funny.
- No, it's part of the movie.

53:51.127 --> 53:52.560
- That was good.
- It went really well.

53:52.728 --> 53:54.696
- I like your badge.
- Thanks, I made it myself.

53:54.864 --> 53:57.924
Great. Just... Who are these people?

53:58.100 --> 54:00.261
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

54:06.542 --> 54:07.634
Let's go before they see us.

54:07.810 --> 54:10.301
Mike! Mike! Over here!

54:10.479 --> 54:13.039
Lookit, okay? You're gonna smile.

54:13.215 --> 54:15.410
Pretend like you know
what you're doing, okay?

54:15.584 --> 54:17.313
- I'm gonna take care of the rest. Yes.
- No.

54:17.486 --> 54:18.919
This was really great...

54:19.088 --> 54:21.318
...but it's too short.
It's so good, it should be longer.

54:21.657 --> 54:23.955
Anyway, I told all my friends,
and they're excited.

54:24.126 --> 54:26.321
- They want to join the store.
- Bring them in.

54:26.495 --> 54:27.723
Okay.

54:27.897 --> 54:29.922
Okay, it's open!

54:30.099 --> 54:31.532
Form two lines.

54:31.700 --> 54:35.136
Rentals on the right
and returns on the left.

54:35.304 --> 54:36.532
The store policy is also...

54:36.705 --> 54:38.730
...two rentals per customer.

54:38.908 --> 54:41.069
Maybe you'd like to get a film
you didn't know about.

54:42.478 --> 54:44.810
Okay, guys, I'm accepting applications
in this line right here.

54:44.980 --> 54:46.311
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:46.482 --> 54:48.507
- What would you like?
- This one Sweded, please.

54:48.684 --> 54:51.346
Okay. Let me just check to see
if you have the proper documents.

54:51.520 --> 54:54.284
It seems like you have a lot of Cs.

54:55.524 --> 54:57.515
I don't even think
you really should have passed.

54:57.693 --> 55:00.662
So we're gonna need a $20
supplement fee for averageness.

55:00.830 --> 55:02.092
- Are you insane? Twenty dollars?
- I'm sorry.

55:02.264 --> 55:03.561
I don't make the rules,
I just have to enforce them.

55:03.732 --> 55:05.097
You're crazy. You're insane.

55:05.267 --> 55:06.996
- I'm leaving.
- You can bend a rule a little.

55:07.169 --> 55:09.729
- Your movies suck anyway!
- No.

55:09.905 --> 55:11.338
Next!

55:11.507 --> 55:13.941
- Excuse me.
- Jerry.

55:14.109 --> 55:15.804
I am RoboCop.

55:16.212 --> 55:18.544
I heard there was a disturbance...

55:18.714 --> 55:21.706
...at Be Kind Rewind video store.

55:21.884 --> 55:24.114
Mr. RoboCop,
may I have an autograph, please?

55:24.286 --> 55:25.810
- For my grandson?
- Me too, me too.

55:25.988 --> 55:30.982
Anything you say
can and will be held against you...

55:31.894 --> 55:33.623
...in a court of RoboCop.

55:34.163 --> 55:35.187
Miss <i>Falewicz.</i>

55:38.334 --> 55:39.961
- Hi, Miss <i>Falewicz.</i>
- Yeah.

55:40.135 --> 55:43.730
- Can you Swede this for me?
- Oh, <i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

55:43.906 --> 55:45.533
I'd really rather not do this one.

55:45.708 --> 55:48.700
I really never really got this movie.

55:48.878 --> 55:50.505
I thought it was a little condescending.

55:50.679 --> 55:53.648
It's... It's a lovely movie.
Full of generosity and giving.

55:53.816 --> 55:55.750
- She teaches him to read.
- I know, ma'am.

55:55.918 --> 55:58.512
How many movies
have that kind of heart?

55:58.687 --> 56:00.018
Okay.

56:00.189 --> 56:03.124
Hoke, that's the spot.
Pull over the car.

56:03.292 --> 56:05.351
- Stop the car right... Hoke!
- This is not the spot.

56:05.527 --> 56:06.687
Are you...? Are you deaf?

56:06.862 --> 56:08.295
- I wish I was deaf.
- This is the spot.

56:08.464 --> 56:10.523
Who is that hussy chasing after us?

56:10.699 --> 56:14.135
- Be gone, hussy. Hoke...
- You know we're not filming any of it?

56:14.303 --> 56:16.100
- We're just scouting.
- I know, I'm just practicing.

56:16.272 --> 56:18.103
I'm staying in character.
Come on, dude.

56:18.274 --> 56:19.935
Let's keep in character, okay?

56:20.109 --> 56:22.509
- All right. Mm-hm.
- Come around the side and help me.

56:22.678 --> 56:24.202
Help me get out of the car.

56:24.380 --> 56:25.642
- Hoke!
- Yes, ma'am.

56:25.814 --> 56:27.543
- Jerry, have you ever seen the movie?
- Hoke.

56:27.716 --> 56:28.774
She doesn't act like that.

56:28.951 --> 56:30.418
Don't you talk to me like that,
young missy.

56:30.586 --> 56:32.110
- She doesn't act like that.
- You stay over there.

56:32.288 --> 56:35.121
Hoke, go and find me the grave
that says Werthan on it.

56:35.291 --> 56:36.724
Go like the wind, run.

56:36.892 --> 56:39.190
Run, Hoke. Please.

56:39.361 --> 56:43.320
W-E-R-T-H-E-N.

56:43.499 --> 56:46.024
Hoke, can you hear me?

56:46.201 --> 56:48.135
Oh, no, Hoke.

56:48.304 --> 56:49.931
You're illiterate, aren't you?

56:50.105 --> 56:52.903
- Jerry.
- I'll teach you how to read.

56:53.075 --> 56:56.977
A W is like a mountain upside down.

56:57.146 --> 56:58.511
Isn't that clever?

56:58.681 --> 57:00.911
Now, what happens
if you add an "er"...

57:01.083 --> 57:02.573
...to the W?
- Mike!

57:02.751 --> 57:03.911
- What do you think?
- You get...

57:04.086 --> 57:05.280
- Wer.
- Wer!

57:05.454 --> 57:07.115
Add a "then, <i>" what do you get?</i>

57:07.289 --> 57:10.315
- Okay, Jerry, stop.
- Wer...

57:10.492 --> 57:12.050
- Would you stop?
- No.

57:12.227 --> 57:14.320
- Wer...
- Werthan, Werthan, Werthan, Werthan!

57:14.496 --> 57:15.929
Werthan, Werthan, Werthan, Werthan!

57:16.098 --> 57:17.531
- Mike.
- Knock it off.

57:17.700 --> 57:18.792
Mike, what are you doing?

57:18.968 --> 57:22.335
- Are we shooting?
- Jerry, come back.

57:23.072 --> 57:24.835
Jerry.

57:29.745 --> 57:32.339
- Hey.
- Don't mess around. I'm not in the mood.

57:33.248 --> 57:35.739
You know, I was in character.

57:35.918 --> 57:37.886
- I know.
- He didn't have to take it so personally.

57:38.053 --> 57:42.046
Well, apparently he did. Jerry, like,
you crossed the line a little bit.

57:42.257 --> 57:44.122
Don't you think
I have my share of humiliation?

57:44.293 --> 57:46.523
Who keeps on giving
the orders all day? He does.

57:46.695 --> 57:47.923
- Uh-huh.
- Who keeps taking them?

57:48.097 --> 57:49.724
- Well, I kind of do all the time.
- No, no, no, no.

57:49.898 --> 57:51.422
Me. And why should I?

57:51.600 --> 57:52.760
- Things have changed.
- Uh-huh.

57:52.935 --> 57:54.425
People <i>recognize</i> me in the street.

57:54.603 --> 57:55.900
- Right, Simon?
- Yeah.

57:56.071 --> 57:57.129
Yeah. Yup.

57:57.306 --> 57:59.206
- Yeah.
- They love me. I want my own trailer.

57:59.375 --> 58:00.899
You have a trailer, okay?

58:01.076 --> 58:02.168
That is where you live.

58:02.344 --> 58:03.709
- Is that spit on there?
- Yes.

58:03.879 --> 58:06.040
- Come on.
- Everybody does know you on the street...

58:06.215 --> 58:09.013
...because all you do is go from your shop
to Mr. Fletcher's and back.

58:09.184 --> 58:10.378
- It's true.
- No, you don't get it.

58:10.552 --> 58:13.521
They look at me in a different way,
with love and resp...

58:13.689 --> 58:15.418
- I'm a star.
- You are a star.

58:15.591 --> 58:17.422
I want my own trailer
next to my trailer.

58:17.593 --> 58:20.061
A movie trailer.
That trailer doesn't count.

58:21.430 --> 58:22.863
Get up, Jerry.

58:23.032 --> 58:25.762
- Everybody's ready.
- It's my time!

58:25.934 --> 58:28.027
Ali's the man!

58:31.073 --> 58:36.409
<i>Ali! Ali! Ali!</i>

58:36.578 --> 58:38.045
It's okay. We're not suggesting...

58:38.213 --> 58:41.979
As far as Foreman goes,
he was devastating that punching bag...

58:42.151 --> 58:45.086
...and we writers
were so frightened for Ali..

58:45.254 --> 58:46.812
...that we were...
- It's incredible.

58:46.989 --> 58:50.516
The pilots are black, I'm black,
the whole plane is black...

58:50.692 --> 58:52.751
...and we're not crashing.

58:56.665 --> 58:59.725
Dave, it's me, HAL.

58:59.902 --> 59:03.394
I'm afraid I can't open
the pod doors, Dave.

59:03.572 --> 59:06.735
Why don't you take a jog
around the space capsule?

59:07.309 --> 59:10.073
Okay, I'm ready. Go.

59:45.314 --> 59:47.509
Alma! This is ketchup.

59:47.683 --> 59:50.914
- You said you were gonna use Kool-Aid!
- Sorry.

59:51.086 --> 59:53.077
God, Alma.

59:54.523 --> 59:56.286
Oh, where's the driver?

59:57.192 --> 59:58.216
All right.

59:58.393 --> 01:00:00.520
We gotta stop off
and pick up an <i>Enquirer.</i>

01:00:01.897 --> 01:00:03.330
Find out what the aliens are doing.

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:06.297
We're upside down!
Look, I'm upside down.

01:00:06.468 --> 01:00:10.700
The whole universe is in a marble!

01:00:31.559 --> 01:00:34.323
I'm glad you have come to your senses.

01:00:34.495 --> 01:00:36.395
I have a list of addresses here
for you to visit.

01:00:36.564 --> 01:00:37.929
Hey, hey. No, no, no.

01:00:38.099 --> 01:00:41.500
Tomorrow, I am starting
a progressive transition...

01:00:41.669 --> 01:00:45.105
...to a modern medium: the DVD.

01:00:45.273 --> 01:00:48.299
You see, I've found
these affordable DVD players...

01:00:48.476 --> 01:00:50.967
...that I'm going to recommend
to my customers.

01:00:51.179 --> 01:00:53.147
Within a couple of months,
half of my catalogue...

01:00:53.314 --> 01:00:55.373
...will be digital.
The rest, by the end of the year.

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.713
Which means more titles
in the same space...

01:00:58.886 --> 01:01:00.148
...and more business.

01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:02.346
Listen, if you don't want
the building demolished...

01:01:02.523 --> 01:01:04.923
...then you're going to have to
make these renovations...

01:01:05.093 --> 01:01:07.755
...with one of the city's
licensed contractors.

01:01:07.929 --> 01:01:11.126
Do you have any idea of the kind of costs
we're talking about here?

01:01:11.299 --> 01:01:14.359
Here's an estimate
of the cost to repair the roof.

01:01:14.535 --> 01:01:17.971
And that's the bare minimum
of work needed. I ...

01:01:18.139 --> 01:01:20.699
- I just don't see it happening.
- Okay.

01:01:20.875 --> 01:01:22.467
Okay, what?

01:01:23.878 --> 01:01:24.970
I'll fix the roof.

01:01:26.013 --> 01:01:27.378
Fine.

01:01:27.682 --> 01:01:30.742
You now have six weeks before
Mr. Baker brings the demolition crew...

01:01:30.918 --> 01:01:34.649
...then you're going to have to
relocate yourself at your own expense.

01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:44.689
Next!

01:01:47.568 --> 01:01:48.796
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:50.301
Whoa, he cut the line!

01:01:50.471 --> 01:01:52.302
- Hey, gramps.
- Hey.

01:01:52.473 --> 01:01:54.703
Back of the line.
I've been waiting an hour out there.

01:01:54.876 --> 01:01:56.503
- Yeah.
- I came all the way from New York.

01:01:56.677 --> 01:01:57.905
New York, for real?

01:01:58.079 --> 01:01:59.706
- Mike and Jerry are famous there?
- No.

01:01:59.881 --> 01:02:01.405
- Hey, back out.
- My... My shop.

01:02:01.582 --> 01:02:04.915
I'm really sorry, sir, but you're going
to have to go to the back of the line.

01:02:05.086 --> 01:02:07.520
- I can't afford a riot in the shop.
- No, this is my business.

01:02:07.688 --> 01:02:09.781
Can somebody explain to me
what's going on here?

01:02:09.957 --> 01:02:12.323
- Hey, Mike! Where's Mikey? Mike!
- Mr. Fletcher.

01:02:12.493 --> 01:02:14.120
- What's going on, man?
- Oh, hey.

01:02:14.295 --> 01:02:16.126
I can... I can explain everything.

01:02:16.764 --> 01:02:18.925
Something terrible happened
with the tapes.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.965
They all got erased.

01:02:21.135 --> 01:02:23.933
I know you didn't want Jerry
to come into the store...

01:02:24.105 --> 01:02:25.367
...but...
- Jerry?

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:28.737
All right, this is the last autograph.
My fingers are getting tired. I'm serious.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:30.400
- Oh, man.
- I'll see you guys tomorrow.

01:02:30.578 --> 01:02:32.705
Let me take your bag for you,
then I can explain...

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.815
Uh-oh, who's back? Mr. Fletchy.
Hey, welcome home, man.

01:02:35.983 --> 01:02:37.473
I got the slogan. Check it out:

01:02:37.652 --> 01:02:40.883
<i>"Be Kind Rewind, Videos à la Carte.</i>

01:02:41.155 --> 01:02:42.520
You name it, we shoot it.

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.521
Be Kind Rewind, Videos à la <i>Carte. "</i>

01:02:44.692 --> 01:02:46.523
- Jerry.
- That's great. I think he gets it.

01:02:46.694 --> 01:02:49.527
- Thanks, Jerry.
- It's snappy. Just put a little drums under it.

01:02:49.697 --> 01:02:51.528
- We'll just...
- I didn't mean to scream at you.

01:02:51.699 --> 01:02:53.997
- I didn't know that you were the boss.
- You know what I mean?

01:02:54.168 --> 01:02:56.602
Listen, kids.
I appreciate your creativity...

01:02:56.771 --> 01:02:59.103
...but let's be realistic for a second.

01:02:59.273 --> 01:03:03.107
We will never hit that number,
and the building will be gone.

01:03:03.277 --> 01:03:04.904
Oh, no, Mr. Fletcher. We can do it.

01:03:05.079 --> 01:03:06.910
We've... We've been doing really,
really good.

01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:09.049
You know, we've been working hard.
We grow every day.

01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:12.311
It's far from enough.
We need to adapt to the market.

01:03:12.487 --> 01:03:15.115
So to hell with documentaries...

01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:17.484
...oldies, cult movies.

01:03:17.658 --> 01:03:19.785
We need to simplify.

01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:21.223
Two sections.

01:03:21.395 --> 01:03:24.330
Action-adventures, comedies.
That's it.

01:03:24.499 --> 01:03:26.899
We got to keep the silent movies,
the Fats movies.

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:29.628
No, no. Quiet. I don't wanna hear
any more about Fats Waller.

01:03:30.204 --> 01:03:33.139
New rules apply
from tomorrow morning.

01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:37.877
Oh, and I forgot.

01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:42.345
DVDs.

01:03:42.517 --> 01:03:43.984
DVD, what?

01:03:44.819 --> 01:03:45.843
No more tapes.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.456
The entire catalogue has to be on DVD
by the end of the year.

01:03:49.624 --> 01:03:50.852
And our films?

01:03:51.025 --> 01:03:52.959
Yours and whatever we rent
from my store.

01:04:03.704 --> 01:04:05.672
I don't know why he's doing this.

01:04:06.374 --> 01:04:09.104
It's like everything
that we've been doing...

01:04:09.277 --> 01:04:12.246
...is just nothing? It's... Just like...

01:04:12.747 --> 01:04:14.715
- We can't keep doing this.
- No way.

01:04:14.882 --> 01:04:18.909
We are doing better business
than this store has ever done.

01:04:19.086 --> 01:04:20.713
We're... We're celebrities now.

01:04:20.888 --> 01:04:23.152
We're on the power list.
He has to listen to us.

01:04:23.324 --> 01:04:26.088
No. No, he don't.
I should've known.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.855
It's my fault. I should've known.
He don't like... He don't like remakes.

01:04:30.765 --> 01:04:31.925
It's worthless to him.

01:04:32.099 --> 01:04:35.193
It's like I'm nothing to him.
I just... I just work here.

01:04:40.174 --> 01:04:42.199
Filthy little punk.

01:04:47.081 --> 01:04:50.175
No way this punk kid
gonna put his filth on my piano.

01:04:57.258 --> 01:05:00.250
<i>No, I erased all the tapes.</i>

01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:02.226
I'm the little punk.

01:05:03.598 --> 01:05:06.897
Why is it always about you guys?

01:05:07.068 --> 01:05:08.501
What about me?

01:05:08.669 --> 01:05:10.500
What about Alma?

01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:14.532
I wanna be a filthy punk too,
you know?

01:05:15.276 --> 01:05:19.076
These are not just simple remakes.

01:05:19.246 --> 01:05:21.441
They are way more creative.

01:05:21.616 --> 01:05:24.084
Of course, if the business
maintains its current progress...

01:05:24.251 --> 01:05:26.276
...we won't hit the objective.

01:05:26.454 --> 01:05:28.854
But if we shorten
the length of the films...

01:05:29.023 --> 01:05:30.684
...we can shoot more of them.

01:05:30.858 --> 01:05:34.817
And we will incrementally increase
the increase of the income.

01:05:34.996 --> 01:05:37.521
- Can you repeat the last...?
- No, Alma.

01:05:37.698 --> 01:05:41.134
- People will feel swindled.
- Not if we include them in the films.

01:05:41.302 --> 01:05:42.701
We'll give them parts to play.

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:45.896
This way: A, with their help,
we can make more movies...

01:05:46.073 --> 01:05:48.701
... B, the films can be shorter
and they won't feel swindled.

01:05:48.876 --> 01:05:52.039
They're not gonna feel cheated,
they won't feel swindled...

01:05:52.213 --> 01:05:54.306
...and they'll see their selves as a part...
- Yes.

01:05:54.482 --> 01:05:55.847
...of the neighborhood.
- They'll become the stockholders...

01:05:56.017 --> 01:05:57.314
...of their own happiness.

01:05:57.485 --> 01:06:00.079
You guys, this is something
we can build on.

01:06:00.254 --> 01:06:03.155
If we do more movies
in a shorter time, we can...

01:06:03.324 --> 01:06:05.155
- We can rent more movies.
- That's what I'm saying.

01:06:05.359 --> 01:06:07.919
- Wait, that's what I just said.
- I thought it before you said it.

01:06:08.095 --> 01:06:09.722
- Doesn't matter who said it first.
- No... Jerry.

01:06:09.897 --> 01:06:11.489
We're all saying...
We're all on the same page.

01:06:11.666 --> 01:06:14.294
- I agree, I agree.
- I wanna be a part of this team officially.

01:06:14.468 --> 01:06:16.129
It's like... What do you call that,
when snow <i>falls...?</i>

01:06:16.303 --> 01:06:18.703
- Avalanche.
- No, when... Snowballing.

01:06:18.873 --> 01:06:21.671
- Snowballing. Getting bigger and bigger.
- That's an avalanche.

01:06:21.842 --> 01:06:24.902
And it incrementally increases
the snowball size.

01:06:25.079 --> 01:06:28.173
- Come on. Right here. I can feel this.
- We need to do this.

01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:30.442
- Go.
- Explode! Big success.

01:06:34.655 --> 01:06:39.490
<i>Do you really wanna buy these expensive</i>
<i>and overly complicated DVD players?</i>

01:06:39.794 --> 01:06:41.887
<i>No. No way.</i>

01:06:42.063 --> 01:06:45.624
<i>So for only $ 20,</i>
<i>you can purchase this digital unit...</i>

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.769
<i>... you can simply tape or glue</i>
<i>into your VCR...</i>

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:52.899
<i>... and then it upgrades</i>
<i>into our Be Kind Rewind DVD player.</i>

01:06:53.074 --> 01:06:56.043
<i>And only then is when</i>
<i>you can play our Be Kind Rewind...</i>

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:58.906
<i>- That is good.</i>
<i>...DVDs.</i>

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.241
<i>Vacation</i> with Chevy Chase.
Comedy, please.

01:07:01.415 --> 01:07:02.905
- That's not Sweded yet. Sorry.
- Comedy.

01:07:03.084 --> 01:07:05.712
- Comedy.
<i>- The Jerk,</i> action.

01:07:05.886 --> 01:07:08.320
Wrong genre. That is a comedy.

01:07:08.489 --> 01:07:10.423
I must exclude you for the day.

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:12.684
You can come back tomorrow.
That's the new system.

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.122
You have to say the right thing.

01:07:14.295 --> 01:07:15.990
Man, the new system sucks, man.

01:07:16.163 --> 01:07:17.926
I'm sick and tired of all these rules.

01:07:18.099 --> 01:07:20.897
- Hey, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> is not a comedy.
- We didn't insult your new rules.

01:07:21.068 --> 01:07:23.536
Now, listen. I want <i>The Jerk...</i>

01:07:23.871 --> 01:07:26.339
...Sweden by tomorrow.
- Sweded, Sweded.

01:07:26.507 --> 01:07:28.134
- Sweded.
- Sweded by tomorrow...

01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:30.903
...or this little thing that's in your...

01:07:31.078 --> 01:07:33.012
Let me see, let me see.

01:07:33.481 --> 01:07:36.541
I'd be lying if I said
I was not waiting for this opportunity...

01:07:36.717 --> 01:07:37.911
...toteach you a lesson.

01:07:38.085 --> 01:07:40.519
Mr. Fletcher,
this is really hurting my arm, okay?

01:07:40.688 --> 01:07:42.656
Listen, I apologize, okay?

01:07:42.823 --> 01:07:45.724
- Good, good.
- I... I will follow the new rules.

01:07:45.893 --> 01:07:47.326
Good. But more importantly...

01:07:47.495 --> 01:07:49.895
...you should never
threaten your auntie again.

01:07:50.064 --> 01:07:52.532
She works very hard
to keep a roof over your head.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.997
And these guys...

01:07:54.168 --> 01:07:56.659
...are working very hard to save ours.

01:07:56.837 --> 01:07:58.236
- You get my drift?
- Yeah, I got it.

01:07:58.706 --> 01:08:00.697
Thank you for the lesson.

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:05.771
Sounds like Fats Waller's
back in the house.

01:08:05.946 --> 01:08:07.208
It's... It's his house.

01:08:09.116 --> 01:08:12.608
<i>Now, my boy, do you know where</i>
<i>our Fats...</i>

01:08:12.787 --> 01:08:14.846
<i>... did record most of his tunes</i>
<i>and why?</i>

01:08:15.022 --> 01:08:16.716
<i>- I know that one.</i>
<i>- I'm not sure.</i>

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:18.290
<i>- I know the answer.</i>
<i>- Mike?</i>

01:08:18.559 --> 01:08:20.322
<i>At RC A Studios in Camden.</i>

01:08:20.493 --> 01:08:23.952
<i>They liked to drive there on the train on the</i>
<i>way to the studio so they can get drunk.</i>

01:08:24.131 --> 01:08:25.758
<i>Sometimes they didn't</i>
<i>even get to the studio...</i>

01:08:25.933 --> 01:08:28.162
<i>... because they would get in a fight</i>
<i>or they'd get arrested.</i>

01:08:28.335 --> 01:08:31.304
<i>Mr. Fletcher, I don't really see</i>
<i>the connection with my lesson.</i>

01:08:31.471 --> 01:08:34.441
There is none.
We changed the subject.

01:08:37.978 --> 01:08:39.274
Set up the cameras over there.

01:08:39.446 --> 01:08:41.880
We wanna get in the red car
to do a little make-out session.

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:48.551
We're walking in the rain.
It's kind of warm and <i>fuzzy,</i> and I kiss you.

01:08:50.658 --> 01:08:51.682
And we're like young lovers.

01:08:53.127 --> 01:08:54.560
Wow, these guys are good.

01:08:56.263 --> 01:08:57.321
They can shoot any style.

01:08:57.497 --> 01:08:59.125
We cast Jack and his friends.

01:09:00.568 --> 01:09:01.660
- Whatever, man.
- You hear what he's saying, man?

01:09:01.836 --> 01:09:03.531
Yo, see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:05.694
Come on.
You want some of this, buddy?

01:09:05.872 --> 01:09:07.773
I'm shooting him.

01:09:07.942 --> 01:09:10.376
Oh, no. Derek!

01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:11.935
Why?

01:09:12.112 --> 01:09:14.376
Look at the pool of blood around him.

01:09:14.548 --> 01:09:15.707
He's with Jesus.

01:09:15.883 --> 01:09:18.908
What's happening to our 'hood?
It's no good.

01:09:19.086 --> 01:09:22.544
<i>It's senseless, the violence.</i>

01:09:35.803 --> 01:09:38.499
Kids, I have to admit...

01:09:40.908 --> 01:09:42.033
... I was wrong.

01:09:42.209 --> 01:09:45.006
To movies with heart.

01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:47.707
- And soul.
<i>- I remember the sandwiches too.</i>

01:09:47.881 --> 01:09:49.850
<i>- We had pig ears.</i>
- Just look at Mr. Fletcher there.

01:09:51.218 --> 01:09:52.947
<i>- Pig ears and white bread.</i>
- I smell elephant.

01:09:54.755 --> 01:09:55.779
You're the number one hunter
in the world.

01:09:55.956 --> 01:09:57.685
When you see that elephant,
you know that you have to kill it.

01:09:59.059 --> 01:10:00.424
- That's great. We did it.
- And cut.

01:10:00.594 --> 01:10:01.618
Now we're like animals.

01:10:03.197 --> 01:10:05.062
I love you, I love you.
I'm having sex with you.

01:10:10.004 --> 01:10:12.700
We're nearly there. One more week.

01:10:12.873 --> 01:10:15.671
<i>"Jerry and Alma in..."</i>
<i>"Jerry and Alma in..."</i>

01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:21.204
Jerry and Alma, Jerry and Alma,
Jerry and Alma.

01:10:22.316 --> 01:10:24.284
Are you jealous or something?

01:10:24.451 --> 01:10:26.510
No. No, I'm not.

01:10:26.687 --> 01:10:29.281
Forget about what I even said.
Don't... I'm sorry.

01:10:29.456 --> 01:10:31.424
Well... Well, really. I mean...

01:10:31.592 --> 01:10:35.050
... how come he's always
the one with you in the movies?

01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:36.696
It's always him.

01:10:36.864 --> 01:10:40.732
Well, Jerry said
that you complained about my...

01:10:40.901 --> 01:10:41.993
That is a dirty lie.

01:10:42.169 --> 01:10:46.003
I never said a word about your mustache.
I didn't say anything about it.

01:10:47.474 --> 01:10:50.409
I never said my mustache.

01:10:50.844 --> 01:10:52.436
Okay, so Jerry was telling the truth.

01:10:52.613 --> 01:10:54.604
And that's why you never wanted
to kiss me or anything.

01:10:54.782 --> 01:10:56.841
No, no. I never complained about that.

01:10:57.017 --> 01:10:58.917
Mike, I never said the word,
and you did.

01:10:59.086 --> 01:11:00.246
So how would you know, huh?

01:11:00.421 --> 01:11:02.912
Because he complains about it
all the time, to tell you the truth.

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:04.182
What's the difference?

01:11:04.358 --> 01:11:06.622
- You think I have one, right?
- No. Really, to be perfectly honest...

01:11:06.794 --> 01:11:08.887
... I don't even think you have one.
- I wish I was dead right now.

01:11:09.063 --> 01:11:11.122
Just really quick. Let me see.

01:11:13.901 --> 01:11:16.301
You know what? I don't see anything.

01:11:17.504 --> 01:11:19.699
- I don't see anything.
- You don't see it?

01:11:19.873 --> 01:11:21.363
No.

01:11:22.643 --> 01:11:23.667
Thanks.

01:11:23.844 --> 01:11:25.778
Maybe I should give you a blind test.

01:11:25.946 --> 01:11:27.504
Yeah, I think we need a blind test.

01:11:32.286 --> 01:11:33.810
So?

01:11:34.822 --> 01:11:37.620
Hey! You're trying to kiss me.

01:11:37.791 --> 01:11:39.520
- Why not?
<i>- "Why not"?</i>

01:11:39.693 --> 01:11:41.718
- Are you in love with me?
- Huh?

01:11:41.895 --> 01:11:43.487
Mm-hm.

01:11:43.664 --> 01:11:44.790
Well, how do I know that?

01:11:44.965 --> 01:11:46.557
You know you're in love
with a person...

01:11:46.734 --> 01:11:49.726
...when you talk to them for a minimum
of 20 minutes a day in your head.

01:11:49.903 --> 01:11:52.895
What if I talk to a guy in my head
for 20 minutes? What would that mean?

01:11:53.073 --> 01:11:54.665
You're in love with Jerry.

01:11:54.842 --> 01:11:57.140
- Huh? Ew, no. We're closed.
- Yes, you are in love with Jerry.

01:11:57.311 --> 01:11:59.040
- No, I'm not.
- Hey, Mike, you hear the door?

01:11:59.213 --> 01:12:01.044
Not at all. No, that's not... It c...

01:12:01.215 --> 01:12:02.705
Listen, it could be anybody.

01:12:02.883 --> 01:12:05.545
- Mr. T, Fats.
- You are in love with him.

01:12:05.719 --> 01:12:07.619
- I know it.
- Mr. Elroy Fletcher.

01:12:07.788 --> 01:12:09.619
Yes.

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:10.916
To whom it may concern...

01:12:11.091 --> 01:12:14.891
...copyright infringement is punishable
by state and federal law.

01:12:15.062 --> 01:12:17.826
Now, I hold in my hand a restraining order
from Trenton...

01:12:17.998 --> 01:12:22.901
...and, actually, a warrant of seizure
from Washington D.C.

01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:24.662
- So you, the defendant...
- What's up?

01:12:24.838 --> 01:12:27.500
... have declined to attend
the judgment proceedings...

01:12:27.674 --> 01:12:30.939
...so the studios are coordinating
to assess...

01:12:31.111 --> 01:12:33.909
...the damages from...
How many titles is it?

01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:35.981
- Approximately 200.
- Okay. So...

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.708
Oh, what do we have here?

01:12:37.885 --> 01:12:39.716
- A record of rental.
- Oh.

01:12:39.887 --> 01:12:42.651
- What?
- Two hundred titles times...

01:12:42.823 --> 01:12:43.983
... how many average viewings?

01:12:44.158 --> 01:12:45.682
Sixty-three times per tape.

01:12:45.859 --> 01:12:49.727
Times 250,000 maximum in damages...

01:12:49.897 --> 01:12:54.163
...and/or up to five years in prison...

01:12:54.334 --> 01:12:57.098
...per offense.
- Which adds up to...

01:12:57.271 --> 01:13:00.900
...3.15 billion dollars in fines...

01:13:01.075 --> 01:13:02.736
...which would need to be paid back
to the studios...

01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:05.538
- I'll write you a check.
...and/or...

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.508
...63,000 years in prison.

01:13:09.683 --> 01:13:14.120
Which, of course, would have to be served
before you could reopen the store.

01:13:14.288 --> 01:13:16.756
But we made the movies ourselves.

01:13:16.924 --> 01:13:18.323
- They're our...
- And people like them.

01:13:18.492 --> 01:13:21.518
You're... You're right. But technically,
you're wrong. You see, these tapes...

01:13:21.695 --> 01:13:22.923
...belong to the studios.

01:13:23.097 --> 01:13:26.260
Look, it's written.
FBI warning, right there.

01:13:26.433 --> 01:13:27.764
It's at the beginning of the tape
as well.

01:13:27.935 --> 01:13:31.928
- But we erased that, so...
- I think it's...

01:13:32.106 --> 01:13:34.301
People come here because
they want to see these movies.

01:13:34.475 --> 01:13:38.104
That's why they come here. They're not
interested in those formulaic big movies.

01:13:38.278 --> 01:13:40.007
They're not interested in them.
They don't wanna see them.

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.477
Sir. Sir.
Taste has nothing to do with this.

01:13:41.648 --> 01:13:43.206
Don't listen to them.
Mr. Fletcher, you can kick them out.

01:13:43.383 --> 01:13:44.941
- The entire film industry is crumbling...
- They're trespassing.

01:13:45.119 --> 01:13:46.245
...because of pirates and bootleggers.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:48.888
And we intend to stop it.
Right now, right here.

01:13:49.056 --> 01:13:52.082
We're not selling boots,
and we're not... We're not pirates.

01:13:52.259 --> 01:13:54.625
- And we don't have viruses.
- I'm sorry, Mr...

01:13:54.795 --> 01:13:56.353
- Fletcher.
- Mr. Fletcher.

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:58.327
I mean, look.
I have a family too, okay?

01:13:58.499 --> 01:14:01.093
I didn't say I do. I mean,
what has this got to do about a family?

01:14:01.268 --> 01:14:04.362
Nevertheless,
this writ gives us permission...

01:14:04.538 --> 01:14:08.099
...to destroy all your black-market tapes
by the end of the day...

01:14:08.275 --> 01:14:11.369
...and all of these assets
in the store...

01:14:11.545 --> 01:14:14.514
...are hereby seized
to pay these penalties to the studios.

01:14:14.681 --> 01:14:16.740
No, no, no. These are... No, no, no.
Not the...

01:14:16.917 --> 01:14:18.350
We just want to get in and out...

01:14:18.519 --> 01:14:20.919
...as painlessly as possible.
- Those are Sweded!

01:14:21.088 --> 01:14:22.248
Hey, let him go.

01:14:28.328 --> 01:14:29.727
Mr. Fletcher?

01:14:29.897 --> 01:14:31.330
Mr. Fletcher.

01:14:31.498 --> 01:14:33.295
I could save the building.
I got a plan B.

01:14:33.467 --> 01:14:37.096
This is a application to make it
a historical landmark.

01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:39.671
I can't believe
that I didn't remember it before.

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.206
It's gonna be easy,
because Fats was born here.

01:14:42.776 --> 01:14:45.643
No, Mike, it's not so simple.

01:14:45.812 --> 01:14:47.871
Why not?
You can go get his birth certificate.

01:14:48.048 --> 01:14:50.676
The address has got to be on the birth
certificate. Go check the public records.

01:14:50.851 --> 01:14:53.319
No, Mike,
we can't provide any documents...

01:14:53.487 --> 01:14:56.320
...to prove that Fats lived here.

01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:58.458
You wanna know why?

01:14:59.159 --> 01:15:00.626
Huh? You wanna know why?

01:15:02.329 --> 01:15:03.921
- Because...
- No, no.

01:15:04.097 --> 01:15:05.359
- No, no, listen.
- I don't wanna...

01:15:05.532 --> 01:15:07.363
Now you don't want
to finish my sentences, huh?

01:15:07.534 --> 01:15:08.967
Boy, look here. I'll finish it.

01:15:09.136 --> 01:15:12.697
We can't prove
Fats Waller lived here...

01:15:12.873 --> 01:15:15.068
...because he never did.

01:15:27.888 --> 01:15:29.879
I think you should come one more time.

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.651
Just tell me why.

01:15:39.266 --> 01:15:42.133
Well, they started as bedtime stories.

01:15:42.302 --> 01:15:44.395
I was trying to make this place
bearable for you.

01:15:46.073 --> 01:15:49.099
And then I could never bring myself
to tell you the truth.

01:15:49.276 --> 01:15:51.710
Well, why Fats Waller?

01:15:51.878 --> 01:15:53.243
You could have picked anybody.

01:15:54.481 --> 01:15:57.780
I mean, Duke Ellington
or Louis Armstrong or...

01:15:57.951 --> 01:15:59.714
Fats was a happy man.

01:15:59.886 --> 01:16:02.548
And I thought
it would make you happy.

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:05.823
And it's true, I lied.

01:16:06.059 --> 01:16:09.187
Now I'm going to hell, upstairs.

01:16:17.437 --> 01:16:20.429
Here we are, we're the villains, right?

01:16:54.341 --> 01:16:56.070
Hold that.

01:17:11.524 --> 01:17:13.458
Mike!

01:17:13.627 --> 01:17:15.857
We want more movies.

01:17:16.029 --> 01:17:17.860
We want more movies!

01:17:18.031 --> 01:17:19.862
Come on, baby.

01:17:20.033 --> 01:17:22.934
Mike, wake up, baby.
We need to make more movies.

01:17:23.103 --> 01:17:25.367
- What are you doing?
- Look at all these people here.

01:17:25.538 --> 01:17:27.335
- We want more movies, man.
- Yeah.

01:17:27.507 --> 01:17:31.170
We cannot do these movies anymore.
It's illegal.

01:17:31.344 --> 01:17:32.606
You can make your own.

01:17:32.779 --> 01:17:36.545
- I don't have ideas for movies, Jerry.
- Oh, bullpucky.

01:17:36.716 --> 01:17:39.844
You have got tons of ideas.
Brilliant ideas.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.079
I hear them,
you mumble them in your sleep.

01:17:42.255 --> 01:17:45.691
Mike, we can make
any movie we want.

01:17:45.859 --> 01:17:49.022
We don't have to make one... They can't
sue us if we're making new ones.

01:17:49.562 --> 01:17:53.191
Make whatever you want.
Make <i>Rush Hour 6,</i> whatever.

01:17:53.366 --> 01:17:54.833
You know what I mean?

01:17:55.001 --> 01:17:58.198
Let's make <i>Scary Town 5000.</i>

01:17:58.371 --> 01:18:00.134
We make it up, baby.

01:18:00.307 --> 01:18:02.104
- You're the best director I know.
- Wait a minute.

01:18:02.275 --> 01:18:03.299
- Wait a minute.
- And I'm the best actor...

01:18:03.476 --> 01:18:05.068
...that I know.
- I have an idea.

01:18:05.245 --> 01:18:08.009
And together we're a team
that can't be stopped!

01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:11.548
Mike. Where did you go? Come back.

01:18:11.718 --> 01:18:12.776
Come on, Mike.

01:18:12.952 --> 01:18:14.920
I want Mr. Fletcher to see.

01:18:15.088 --> 01:18:17.420
Mr. Fletcher.

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:20.858
Mr. Fletcher!

01:18:21.027 --> 01:18:22.426
What do you need me for?

01:18:23.029 --> 01:18:24.496
To hell with them, Mr. Fletcher.

01:18:24.664 --> 01:18:27.758
We don't have to move to the projects
if we don't want, we can stay right here.

01:18:27.934 --> 01:18:30.198
How do we do that, exactly?

01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:32.235
We're gonna make a movie, all of us.

01:18:32.405 --> 01:18:34.236
All of these people
came out to support us.

01:18:34.407 --> 01:18:35.965
We're gonna make a movie together.

01:18:36.142 --> 01:18:37.404
Like the city that saves itself?

01:18:37.577 --> 01:18:40.011
No, no. Check it, check it.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:43.547
We're gonna do a movie
about Fats Waller's life.

01:18:43.717 --> 01:18:45.776
Your hero, my hero.

01:18:45.952 --> 01:18:49.718
And we don't need permission
to make movies on our own.

01:18:49.889 --> 01:18:51.379
This is for us to watch.

01:18:51.558 --> 01:18:54.425
- The whole town is participating.
- It'll be ours.

01:18:54.594 --> 01:18:57.586
The movie could be called
<i>Fats Was Born in Passaic.</i>

01:18:57.764 --> 01:19:00.528
- Yeah!
- Everybody knows I was lying.

01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:03.931
- You gonna humiliate me again?
- No. No, Mr. Fletcher.

01:19:04.104 --> 01:19:06.265
No, he's trying to prove you were right.

01:19:06.439 --> 01:19:10.273
Our past belongs to us,
we can change it if we want.

01:19:10.443 --> 01:19:13.435
Sure. My mom...

01:19:13.613 --> 01:19:17.777
My mom saw Fats Waller playing...

01:19:17.951 --> 01:19:21.216
Playing the piano right here
in the Passaic Theater.

01:19:21.388 --> 01:19:24.846
Sure. Anybody wanna
say anything about that?

01:19:25.024 --> 01:19:26.184
Yes, me.

01:19:26.359 --> 01:19:30.819
My grandfather used to watch him
play Bach every night in the church.

01:19:30.997 --> 01:19:34.057
- There you go.
- My great-uncle saved his life.

01:19:34.234 --> 01:19:38.500
He took the train to Camden
to record in the RCA studios.

01:19:38.671 --> 01:19:41.105
He really did take the train to Camden.

01:19:41.274 --> 01:19:42.536
That's right!

01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:44.939
Mike. We only have a week
before the demolition.

01:19:45.111 --> 01:19:46.476
It's not a problem. That's okay.

01:19:46.646 --> 01:19:48.637
We'll shoot the whole thing in a week.

01:19:48.815 --> 01:19:50.806
And we could take donations
to see the movie...

01:19:50.984 --> 01:19:52.645
...and use the money
to save the building.

01:19:52.819 --> 01:19:55.720
- I'll play Fats.
- No, no. You're not. I'm gonna play Fats.

01:19:55.889 --> 01:19:56.947
We'll see who plays Fats.

01:19:57.123 --> 01:19:59.057
- You're not gonna play Fats.
- We'll see. There'll be an audition process.

01:19:59.225 --> 01:20:00.624
No, there's not.
You're not gonna play Fats.

01:20:00.794 --> 01:20:02.352
- May the best man play Fats.
- Okay.

01:20:02.529 --> 01:20:03.791
Anyway, we should do it.

01:20:05.398 --> 01:20:06.865
Good idea.

01:20:15.575 --> 01:20:18.271
- Test, test, test.
- It looks like it's working.

01:20:18.445 --> 01:20:19.639
- I can't tell if it's working.
- I think it's working...

01:20:19.813 --> 01:20:20.871
...because this is pressed down.
- All right.

01:20:21.047 --> 01:20:22.912
<i>- Test. I can't tell.</i>
<i>- It's working.</i>

01:20:23.082 --> 01:20:24.777
- Yeah, that's... Okay.
- It's working.

01:20:24.951 --> 01:20:28.682
But it all started right here
at 261 Main Street.

01:20:28.855 --> 01:20:33.053
Miss <i>Falewicz,</i> can you tell us
some of the true history of Fats Waller?

01:20:33.226 --> 01:20:36.491
Fats was born
in Mr. Fletcher's video store.

01:20:36.663 --> 01:20:39.131
He was the youngest
of seven children...

01:20:39.299 --> 01:20:43.736
...and all of them died
before they even got to be 5.

01:20:43.903 --> 01:20:45.200
- Gangsters killed them all.
- Yep.

01:20:45.371 --> 01:20:48.863
- They came low-riding.
- Yup, they just shot them. They were like:

01:20:49.042 --> 01:20:50.475
- They were like ninjas.
- Yeah.

01:20:50.643 --> 01:20:52.235
But, boys, there's nothing fun about it.

01:20:52.412 --> 01:20:54.312
- They were awful.
- It was kind of fun, though...

01:20:54.481 --> 01:20:55.505
...if you think about it.

01:20:55.682 --> 01:20:58.879
What is the first instrument
that Fats learned to play?

01:20:59.752 --> 01:21:03.483
- From what I recall it was the piano.
- I think it was the harmonium, actually.

01:21:03.656 --> 01:21:05.886
Yes, she's correct.

01:21:06.059 --> 01:21:11.053
And he moved on to play one of the
biggest instruments in the music business.

01:21:11.231 --> 01:21:12.255
And that's the organ.

01:21:12.432 --> 01:21:16.198
He would spend nights here
playing, like, Bach.

01:21:16.369 --> 01:21:19.031
You know, here at the great organ here.
Right here.

01:21:20.907 --> 01:21:24.172
You guys, listen. There's a lot of
different ways we can start the movie...

01:21:24.344 --> 01:21:28.280
...but I'm just putting my vote in,
we start at Fats' birth.

01:21:28.448 --> 01:21:29.540
Boring.

01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:32.913
Hey, man. I think we should have the
gangsters. You know what I'm saying?

01:21:33.086 --> 01:21:36.078
- With the:
- I like that.

01:21:36.256 --> 01:21:39.225
Everybody, listen, listen.
Start with the death.

01:21:39.392 --> 01:21:41.724
- But that's backwards.
- No, it's not backwards at all.

01:21:41.895 --> 01:21:44.159
That is like <i>Citizen Kane.</i>
You are an original.

01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:45.661
If you're going backwards...

01:21:45.832 --> 01:21:49.427
...then do the people talk, like,
backwards in the scene?

01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:10.047
<i>Ain't misbehavin '
<i>Saving all my lovin ' for you</i></i>

01:22:13.626 --> 01:22:15.890
You know... I'm fat. Fats is fat.

01:22:16.062 --> 01:22:18.622
That's his name.
So I thought I could...

01:22:18.798 --> 01:22:23.633
You thought wrong.
But let's have a conversation about this.

01:22:23.803 --> 01:22:25.293
Just a brief conversation.

01:22:25.471 --> 01:22:28.133
He's not even fat.
I don't even think he looks like him at all.

01:22:28.308 --> 01:22:30.071
- Be quiet.
- Go outside.

01:22:30.810 --> 01:22:33.870
Somebody's about to get knocked out.

01:22:35.248 --> 01:22:37.113
Kansas City, the train station,
the death scene.

01:22:37.283 --> 01:22:39.410
Mr. Jack, Mr. Jack. It's going.

01:22:39.586 --> 01:22:42.020
It's good. It's good.
Thank you, Andrea.

01:22:42.188 --> 01:22:44.349
- What the hell is a "harmoninium" anyway?
- Harmonium.

01:22:44.524 --> 01:22:47.049
Okay, what is it, just a weird thing
that makes harmonies?

01:22:47.226 --> 01:22:48.284
- It's fine.
- I give up.

01:22:48.461 --> 01:22:49.826
You got the keyboard here already.

01:22:49.996 --> 01:22:51.486
Fats liked to tickle the piano, right?

01:22:51.664 --> 01:22:53.632
So my hand touches
the black keys, the white keys.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.131
- It's wrong.
- And then we tickle.

01:22:55.301 --> 01:22:57.428
- Tickle, tickle, tickle.
- Fats played a piano, not a finger machine.

01:22:57.604 --> 01:22:59.595
- You gotta put something there with keys.
- It's funny.

01:22:59.772 --> 01:23:02.536
It's cheating. You're just lazy.
You gotta put something in there.

01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:04.973
Doesn't look very much like the '20s.

01:23:05.144 --> 01:23:06.634
- It's clearly a bathtub.
- This goes?

01:23:06.813 --> 01:23:09.213
No, forget it. You know what?
Forget it. I got a better idea.

01:23:09.382 --> 01:23:11.782
We gotta have a bunch of them anyway.
You know what I'm thinking?

01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:14.044
- What?
- Get me some cardboard.

01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:20.058
Hey, look, this is how
you make it look old.

01:23:20.226 --> 01:23:22.956
The fan give the impression
that it's a old film.

01:23:23.129 --> 01:23:24.994
And the string is for the scratches.
See?

01:23:25.164 --> 01:23:26.631
This is for the voice-over.

01:23:26.799 --> 01:23:29.324
<i>Miss Falewicz, can you tell us</i>
<i>some of the true history...?</i>

01:23:29.502 --> 01:23:31.527
And also this is for the music.

01:23:31.704 --> 01:23:35.231
<i>Fats was born</i>
<i>in Mr. Fletcher's video store.</i>

01:23:37.276 --> 01:23:39.073
And push and breathe.

01:23:39.245 --> 01:23:43.011
And make a groaning sound like,
<i>"Oh, there's a baby coming out of me."</i>

01:23:43.182 --> 01:23:45.650
Wilson, send the kids.

01:23:45.818 --> 01:23:47.513
<i>- Some gangsters killed them all.</i>
<i>- Yep.</i>

01:23:47.687 --> 01:23:50.781
<i>- They came low-riding.</i>
<i>- They were like ninjas.</i>

01:23:54.527 --> 01:23:56.927
<i>And I heard</i>
<i>that there was glass everywhere.</i>

01:23:57.096 --> 01:23:59.087
<i>The gang was like a pizza gang.</i>

01:23:59.265 --> 01:24:02.200
<i>And when they killed you, there was</i>
<i>always a pizza behind you on the wall.</i>

01:24:02.368 --> 01:24:04.598
Fall, fall. Mr. Jack, fall.

01:24:05.538 --> 01:24:08.336
<i>When he was young he used to follow</i>
<i>his father around the streets...</i>

01:24:08.508 --> 01:24:10.738
<i>... because his father</i>
<i>was a street minister.</i>

01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:15.142
Even if I ascended to heaven,
thou art there.

01:24:15.314 --> 01:24:17.179
Clap your hands.

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.045
- Does it look good or what?
- Yeah.

01:24:19.218 --> 01:24:20.879
Continue to jiggle.

01:24:21.054 --> 01:24:22.954
- Tickle the keys, Mike.
- I'm doing it.

01:24:23.122 --> 01:24:24.714
I can clearly see
that you're not doing it.

01:24:24.891 --> 01:24:26.882
- I barely can see...
- I'm clearly doing it.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.087
Yeah. Okay.

01:24:31.297 --> 01:24:33.788
Wilson, how do you drive a train?

01:24:33.966 --> 01:24:35.558
Push up the switches
on the generator.

01:24:35.735 --> 01:24:37.100
Okay. I got it.

01:24:39.739 --> 01:24:41.104
Yeah!

01:24:50.083 --> 01:24:51.550
Alma, you in position?

01:24:51.718 --> 01:24:53.845
We're just crossing the river now.
You see us?

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:56.784
<i>Yeah, I can see you.</i>
<i>I'm starting the camera.</i>

01:24:58.758 --> 01:25:02.250
Come on, blow that trombone harder.
That is not a piccolo. Mike.

01:25:02.428 --> 01:25:06.797
You need to act more drunker.
Come on, you guys are better than that.

01:25:06.966 --> 01:25:07.990
Action!

01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:19.704
<i>Let me tell you, rent party</i>
<i>was the place to be in the '20s and '30s.</i>

01:25:19.879 --> 01:25:23.110
<i>Man, they were jumping.</i>

01:25:25.752 --> 01:25:28.516
Clear out, clear out. Cops are coming.
Cops are coming, come on.

01:25:39.031 --> 01:25:40.055
Alma.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.131
Go, go, go.

01:25:42.301 --> 01:25:43.734
Aren't you guys being
a bit ambitious here?

01:25:43.903 --> 01:25:45.370
No. This is what makes the movie.

01:25:45.538 --> 01:25:47.403
All right, all right.
This is getting dangerous.

01:25:47.573 --> 01:25:51.805
- Promise me this is it.
- We promise, Mr. Fletcher.

01:25:51.978 --> 01:25:54.378
Okay, go, go.

01:25:56.783 --> 01:25:58.444
Not the big one, not the big one.

01:25:58.618 --> 01:26:01.178
- What's it matter?
- Do the little one, okay?

01:26:01.354 --> 01:26:03.914
- No, no, no. It says use other door.
- <i>Jeez.</i>

01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:07.355
- Okay, fine, just shield your...
- Just let the car go by.

01:26:17.103 --> 01:26:19.697
- What is this? What the crap?
- God dang it.

01:26:19.872 --> 01:26:22.067
I told you I wanted
to break the big glass.

01:26:30.783 --> 01:26:32.808
Why? It's like a hall of mirrors.

01:26:32.985 --> 01:26:35.385
- What the crap, what is this?
- That's it. I'm going home.

01:26:39.325 --> 01:26:40.451
Come on, let's go.

01:26:41.727 --> 01:26:45.857
- Be careful. It's over there.
- Shut up.

01:26:47.166 --> 01:26:48.724
- You got it?
- Yep.

01:26:48.901 --> 01:26:51.870
You got it?

01:26:52.505 --> 01:26:53.699
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:26:53.873 --> 01:26:55.340
What...?

01:26:55.508 --> 01:26:57.237
Mike?

01:26:57.410 --> 01:27:00.277
- Mike, what are you doing?
- Nothing. We were leaving, don't hurt us.

01:27:00.446 --> 01:27:03.279
- Of course I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Why do you got that knife then?

01:27:03.449 --> 01:27:05.781
- I thought you were robbers, man.
- Jerry, help me.

01:27:05.952 --> 01:27:08.011
Okay, hold on. Hold on, hold on.

01:27:08.187 --> 01:27:10.155
Release.

01:27:13.826 --> 01:27:17.660
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:20.094
Are you...? Are you sleeping here?

01:27:20.266 --> 01:27:22.029
I n the hardcore-porn room?

01:27:22.201 --> 01:27:25.693
Temporarily, yes,
I am sleeping here, okay?

01:27:25.872 --> 01:27:27.806
I don't want anybody
to know this, all right, please?

01:27:27.974 --> 01:27:28.998
Fellas, I tell you what.

01:27:29.175 --> 01:27:32.770
I'll fix the windows,
you keep that quiet.

01:27:32.945 --> 01:27:33.969
- Okay.
- Please.

01:27:34.146 --> 01:27:35.579
We just gonna go.

01:27:35.748 --> 01:27:38.478
Okay, let's go. Stealth.

01:27:47.894 --> 01:27:50.385
- Don't get involved. Don't get involved.
- Is that it?

01:27:52.365 --> 01:27:54.162
I tried to hold them back
as best I could. Guys, we can't...

01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:55.357
- We got a job to do.
- I know you do.

01:27:55.534 --> 01:27:57.502
- It's on. It's on.
- All right.

01:27:58.871 --> 01:28:01.635
Come on in. Everybody, don't
forget to put money in the can.

01:28:01.807 --> 01:28:04.173
- We're trying to raise money.
- Every dollar helps.

01:28:04.343 --> 01:28:07.779
You know, if you got a 20, that's gonna
help even more. That's more valuable.

01:28:07.947 --> 01:28:09.778
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

01:28:09.949 --> 01:28:11.211
Hey there. Yes, sir. Thank you.

01:28:11.384 --> 01:28:13.011
Make sure you have
a donation for church.

01:28:13.185 --> 01:28:15.983
I will do. All right then. Thank you, sir.
The check will be fine.

01:28:16.155 --> 01:28:17.281
All right.

01:28:17.456 --> 01:28:20.653
Can you put the TV a little bit higher?

01:28:21.961 --> 01:28:22.985
All right.

01:28:23.162 --> 01:28:25.756
This is exciting. Oh, a 20.

01:28:25.932 --> 01:28:27.524
It's gonna work, right?

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.361
Well, I took the offer.

01:28:29.535 --> 01:28:31.628
It looks like we're gonna be
moving to the projects.

01:28:31.804 --> 01:28:35.740
The money we collect tonight is not gonna
be enough to even start the work.

01:28:35.908 --> 01:28:39.867
So, what we gonna do is watch the movie.
And then we go.

01:28:40.046 --> 01:28:41.775
- Come on. All right?
- She can't see the TV.

01:28:41.948 --> 01:28:42.972
- Can you see it now?
- Yeah.

01:28:43.149 --> 01:28:45.674
- Hey, where's Mike?
- Okay.

01:28:45.851 --> 01:28:48.786
Have a little faith, you guys,
he's gonna be here.

01:28:48.955 --> 01:28:52.413
If you can just remain patient,
and don't forget to put money in the can.

01:28:52.591 --> 01:28:56.118
<i>- Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>
- Everybody stay cool.

01:28:56.295 --> 01:29:00.857
<i>Mike, Mike, Mike!</i>

01:29:10.309 --> 01:29:14.541
<i>Who would expect a simple influenza virus</i>
<i>would get him in his bed?</i>

01:29:14.714 --> 01:29:17.683
Mike. Mike, stop shooting now.

01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:20.648
- What are you doing?
- I'm just getting the end shot.

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.254
- I have to get the end titles.
- It doesn't have to be perfect.

01:29:23.422 --> 01:29:27.153
Yeah, I know what time it is.
I've been looking... I've been here all day.

01:29:27.326 --> 01:29:30.727
Yeah. No, we... I didn't start the job.

01:29:30.896 --> 01:29:35.629
I can't demolish a building
with a hundred people in it, that's why.

01:29:35.801 --> 01:29:37.325
Right, good idea.

01:29:37.503 --> 01:29:38.765
He's coming down.

01:29:40.172 --> 01:29:42.106
What is this?

01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:48.303
- Mike's here.
- Hey, look who's here.

01:29:50.483 --> 01:29:53.509
Oh, no.

01:29:55.054 --> 01:29:58.353
No one could see it,
so I had to put it up on a higher thing.

01:29:58.524 --> 01:30:00.788
- You messed up the TV, man.
- I messed up the TV.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.121
So how we gonna watch it?

01:30:05.264 --> 01:30:08.893
Yo, Fletcher.
What the hell's going on here?

01:30:09.068 --> 01:30:13.471
Well, right now, we need you, baby.
We need you.

01:30:13.639 --> 01:30:15.402
- Right here, right here.
- What is that?

01:30:15.574 --> 01:30:18.008
- Is this what you've been looking for?
- It's a projector?

01:30:18.177 --> 01:30:20.941
- Where shall I put the monster?
- Right here, right here.

01:30:21.113 --> 01:30:23.206
Put this right here.
This is the finest machinery...

01:30:23.382 --> 01:30:25.407
...made for mankind.
- Oh, my God.

01:30:25.584 --> 01:30:27.074
- I saved the day.
- Yeah.

01:30:27.253 --> 01:30:29.278
- Okay. That's good.
- It's dangerous in here.

01:30:29.455 --> 01:30:32.049
To tell you the truth, I don't think people
could have seen the little TV...

01:30:32.224 --> 01:30:33.851
...from the back anyway.
It would've been...

01:30:34.026 --> 01:30:35.584
I think everybody should turn around
and watch...

01:30:35.761 --> 01:30:38.229
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everyone, turn your seats around.

01:30:38.397 --> 01:30:40.661
We're gonna watch the movie
up on the wall now.

01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:42.391
- Yes, we are.
- And it's much better.

01:30:42.568 --> 01:30:44.468
It's actually... It's a blessing in disguise.

01:30:44.637 --> 01:30:46.434
Because the TV...
We were gonna watch it on a TV this big.

01:30:46.605 --> 01:30:47.765
You ain't gonna see an image
brighter than this.

01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.532
You will never see an image
sharper than this.

01:30:49.708 --> 01:30:52.939
Now, that's a premiere.
Make it as big as you can.

01:30:53.112 --> 01:30:56.843
Make it as... Yeah.
Stretch it from there all the way to there.

01:30:57.016 --> 01:30:58.916
Anything you need...

01:30:59.085 --> 01:31:01.212
Just keep your hands off this.
This is fine machinery.

01:31:01.387 --> 01:31:04.356
- I will. I promise.
- We did it!

01:31:07.259 --> 01:31:09.625
All right, let's get it going.
Let's get this show on the road.

01:31:09.795 --> 01:31:13.356
- Yeah!
- That's what we waiting for.

01:31:32.384 --> 01:31:36.047
<i>Well, it all began right here,</i>
<i>on this spot.</i>

01:31:36.222 --> 01:31:37.780
<i>It was a different neighborhood then,</i>
<i>but look here...</i>

01:31:37.957 --> 01:31:39.891
<i>... he was born in 261 Main Street.</i>

01:31:40.059 --> 01:31:42.186
<i>It's a boy.</i>

01:31:47.032 --> 01:31:48.431
Here's our part. Here's our part.

01:31:48.601 --> 01:31:51.195
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah!

01:31:52.138 --> 01:31:54.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:32:15.261 --> 01:32:18.424
<i>Yes, in the Century Theater,</i>
<i>right here in Passaic.</i>

01:32:18.597 --> 01:32:20.531
Mr. Fletcher? What's going on?

01:32:20.699 --> 01:32:23.133
Oh, hi, Mr. Baker.

01:32:24.637 --> 01:32:26.901
- Let's step outside.
- Wait, hold on a second, Mr. Fletcher.

01:32:27.072 --> 01:32:28.835
I'm sorry, but time is up.
We agreed on this.

01:32:29.008 --> 01:32:31.272
Now, you must evacuate the building
so we can start.

01:32:31.443 --> 01:32:34.844
Okay. Mr. Baker, you're right.

01:32:35.014 --> 01:32:37.346
We should've evacuated an hour ago.

01:32:37.516 --> 01:32:41.714
But, please,
let us watch our film. Okay?

01:32:41.887 --> 01:32:45.379
And if you give me just one hour,
I promise there won't be a riot.

01:32:45.858 --> 01:32:48.725
An empty building,
and you can pull it down.

01:32:48.894 --> 01:32:50.953
It's all yours.

01:32:51.463 --> 01:32:54.694
- Please.
- You have one hour.

01:32:55.868 --> 01:32:57.130
One hour.

01:33:00.673 --> 01:33:04.473
<i>Fats' life was on a train.</i>

01:33:04.643 --> 01:33:05.940
<i>He had given up flying.</i>

01:33:06.111 --> 01:33:10.275
<i>He was tired of being refused entrance</i>
<i>to the plane because of his color.</i>

01:33:12.451 --> 01:33:15.682
<i>Once, however,</i>
<i>segregation saved his life.</i>

01:33:16.388 --> 01:33:21.223
<i>The plane he had been rejected from</i>
<i>crashed in Kansas City.</i>

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.994
<i>Fats, are you okay?</i>

01:33:57.162 --> 01:33:58.561
<i>Fats, you okay?</i>

01:33:59.498 --> 01:34:01.796
<i>Oh, my God, you're... Fats, wake up.</i>

01:34:01.967 --> 01:34:04.299
<i>Fats.</i>

01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:07.098
<i>Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:12.707
<i>Help! Help! Help!</i>
<i>Is there a doctor on the train?</i>

01:34:12.878 --> 01:34:14.175
<i>We need a doctor!</i>

01:34:14.346 --> 01:34:16.678
<i>He 's my friend!</i>

01:34:16.849 --> 01:34:20.945
<i>Anybody? This train 's not leaving</i>
<i>until we get a doctor!</i>

01:36:00.686 --> 01:36:04.713
<i>Say up in Harlem at a table for two</i>

01:36:05.657 --> 01:36:09.354
<i>There were four of us</i>
<i>Me, your big feet and you</i>

01:36:10.028 --> 01:36:12.997
<i>From your ankle up</i>
<i>I'll say you sure are sweet</i>

01:36:13.799 --> 01:36:16.700
<i>From there down</i>
<i>There 's just too much feet</i>

01:36:16.869 --> 01:36:19.303
<i>Yes, your feet's too big</i>

01:36:20.739 --> 01:36:23.173
<i>Don't want ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>

01:36:24.543 --> 01:36:27.307
<i>Can't use you 'cause your feet's too big</i>

<i>I really hate ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>
<i>Yeah</i>

<i>Where 'd ya get 'em?</i>

<i>Your girl, she likes you</i>
<i>She thinks you're nice</i>

<i>Got what it takes to be in paradise</i>

01:36:50.102 --> 01:36:52.002
<i>She said she likes your face</i>

01:36:52.171 --> 01:36:53.968
<i>She likes your rig</i>

01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:57.573
<i>Man, oh, man, them things are too big</i>

01:36:57.743 --> 01:37:00.177
<i>Oh, your feet's too big</i>

<i>Don't want ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>

<i>I hate ya 'cause your feet's too big</i>

<i>Are you good? Is that good?</i>

01:37:33.212 --> 01:37:37.774
This Chinese bamboo ain't strong.
I can't believe you got me out here.

01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:42.250
Forget about the bamboo,
we gotta go solve a crime.

01:37:59.505 --> 01:38:06.343
<i>There 's more to life</i>
<i>Than this old place, hey</i>
