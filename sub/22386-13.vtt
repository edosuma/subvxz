Hi, Mr. Porter!

00:56.290 --> 00:57.256
Can I help?

00:57.258 --> 00:58.290
Thanks, Marshall.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.925
I think I got this.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.560
Oh!

01:02.863 --> 01:04.296
Here you go.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.331
Whoa!

01:06.333 --> 01:08.600
(Squishing)

01:08.602 --> 01:09.735
(Sighing)

01:09.737 --> 01:10.803
Sorry, Mr. Porter.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.071
I'll help
clean them up.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.273
No, no, you've
done enough.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.108
(Whimpering)

01:16.110 --> 01:18.377
I mean, thanks, Marshall.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.979
I got it.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.648
(Sighing)

01:22.650 --> 01:23.282
Oh, Chickaletta!

01:23.284 --> 01:26.685
What a lovely day for
a quick scooter ride!

01:33.894 --> 01:34.793

Sorry, Mayor Goodway!

Ouchy.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.834
(Clucking)

01:42.103 --> 01:44.670
I can't do anything right.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.170
Marshall!

01:45.172 --> 01:47.773
Wanna play some
volleyball, dude?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.341
I don't know.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.442
Come on.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.710
It's a blast!

01:51.712 --> 01:54.012
Well... okay.

01:54.014 --> 01:57.049
Check this shot out!

(Creaking)

02:02.923 --> 02:03.889
Oh, no!

02:03.891 --> 02:05.791
Sorry, pups.
I'll get it.

Hey, everyone!

02:06.927 --> 02:11.430

NARRATOR:
<i>Time for Apollo, the Super Pup!</i>

02:19.306 --> 02:22.207
Got the ball, pups!

Pups?

02:23.244 --> 02:26.311
(Laughing)

02:26.313 --> 02:27.980
SKYE:
Can you believe he did that?

02:27.982 --> 02:31.216
CHASE:
That silly pup,
always messing things up.

02:31.218 --> 02:34.720
(Laughing)

02:35.556 --> 02:37.589
CHASE:
That's what he gets!

02:37.591 --> 02:38.323
(Laughing)

02:38.325 --> 02:41.059
That pup can't do
anything right!

02:41.061 --> 02:41.760
(Sighing)

02:41.762 --> 02:46.064
It's true,
I can't do anything right.

02:46.066 --> 02:46.598
(Sighing)

02:46.600 --> 02:49.902
Maybe the PAW Patrol
needs a break from me.

02:54.175 --> 02:57.376
So long, PAW Patrol.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.251
Great episode.

03:06.253 --> 03:09.154
Hey, Marshall missed
the whole show.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.155
Where is he, anyway?

03:10.157 --> 03:13.492
All I see is this
flattened volleyball.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.493
Let's find him!

03:14.495 --> 03:17.062
I'll check the lookout.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.397
(Grunting)

03:18.399 --> 03:19.097
Uh-oh...

03:19.099 --> 03:21.066
Ryder, have you
seen Marshall?

03:21.068 --> 03:22.067
No, is he missing?

03:22.069 --> 03:26.271
We haven't seen him since he
ran off to get the volleyball.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.810
RYDER:
His fire truck's gone.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.279
Hey Marshall, it's Ryder.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.281
<i> Where are you off to?</i>
(Sighing)

03:36.283 --> 03:37.182
Hi, Ryder.

03:37.184 --> 03:38.984
I'm gonna take a break
from the PAW Patrol.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.587
The pups are tired of me
messing up their games.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.022
<i> I wanna stop causing problems.</i>

03:44.024 --> 03:45.224
BOTH:
Huh?

03:45.226 --> 03:46.992
Marshall out.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.961
(Beeping)

03:48.963 --> 03:50.295
Marshall?

03:50.297 --> 03:52.564
(Sighing)

03:53.500 --> 03:54.433
Something's wrong.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.269
Marshall thinks you pups
don't want him around.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.437
What?
No way!

03:58.439 --> 04:01.139
We have to find him
and bring him home.

04:01.141 --> 04:04.476
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

04:05.946 --> 04:09.047
PAW Patrol...
to the lookout!

04:09.049 --> 04:11.083
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

04:11.085 --> 04:14.353
(Barking)

04:16.056 --> 04:17.356
Hey, this is so weird.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.257
We're all still standing.

04:18.259 --> 04:23.028
Yeah, the elevator seems
kind of empty without Marshall.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.364
(Whimpering)

04:35.109 --> 04:37.542
(Elevator dinging)

04:40.247 --> 04:44.149
PAW Patrol, ready for
action, Ryder sir!

04:44.151 --> 04:45.450
Pups, we all know
why we're here.

04:45.452 --> 04:49.221
Somehow Marshall got the idea
that we don't want him around.

04:49.223 --> 04:52.357
Of course we want
Marshall around!

04:52.359 --> 04:53.525
He's funny!

04:53.527 --> 04:54.760
And loves to play.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.261
Yeah, he's really cool.

04:56.263 --> 05:00.165
Especially his water cannons
on a hot day.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.533
(Laughing)

05:01.535 --> 05:02.634
But he doesn't know that,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.436
so he's taking a break
from the PAW Patrol.

05:04.438 --> 05:08.273
We've gotta find him and let him
know how important he is.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.775
He's our buddy!

05:09.777 --> 05:11.276
(Cheering)

05:11.278 --> 05:15.614
Spy Chase, I need you to search
the backwoods with your drone.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.415
Yes!

05:16.417 --> 05:19.785
Super spy Chase
is on the case!

05:20.487 --> 05:21.920
Skye, you and your helicopter

05:21.922 --> 05:24.323
can search up near
Jake's Mountain.

05:24.325 --> 05:24.890
(Barking)

05:24.892 --> 05:26.391
Let's take to the sky!

05:26.393 --> 05:29.294
I need the rest of
you pups to spread out.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.762
Let's find Marshall!

05:30.764 --> 05:32.898

Whoa!

Hey, there's only one
dalmation pup

07:26.046 --> 07:29.347
with puffs of smoke for spots.

07:31.819 --> 07:35.620
Hey, you're not a pup with
puffs of smoke for spots!

<i> Keep up the search.</i>

Need a bath, Rocky?

08:12.593 --> 08:15.494
No, I'm just looking for...

08:15.496 --> 08:17.696
Huh?

Marshall!

Marshall's fire truck

08:38.285 --> 08:40.118
on a trail in the woods!

08:40.120 --> 08:41.586
(Tires screeching)

08:41.588 --> 08:42.787
Great job, Skye!

08:42.789 --> 08:44.856
<i> Do you see him there?</i>

08:44.858 --> 08:47.626
No, I don't seem him anywhere.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.829
RYDER:
<i> Chase, catch up to Skye</i>
<i> and see if your spy drone</i>

08:50.831 --> 08:52.230
<i> can locate Marshall.</i>

08:52.232 --> 08:55.667
Spy Chase is on the case!

08:57.905 --> 08:59.905
Huh?

08:59.907 --> 09:01.139
Found you!

09:01.141 --> 09:02.207
Ugh!

09:02.209 --> 09:04.175
At least I thought I did.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.678
(Tires screeching)

(Barking)
Spy drone control!

(Barking)
Launch!

09:20.394 --> 09:22.327
(Buzzing)

09:22.329 --> 09:24.429
Huh?

09:24.431 --> 09:27.566
What's all that buzzing?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.368
Pesky mosquitoes!

09:30.370 --> 09:33.071
CHASE:
Nice work, spy drone!

09:33.073 --> 09:34.973
Ryder, I found him!

09:34.975 --> 09:36.341
RYDER:
<i> Good work, Chase!</i>

09:36.343 --> 09:38.977
There you are, little bunny!

09:38.979 --> 09:41.112
Is this your home?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.782

You're a mama!

09:47.821 --> 09:48.887
No, come back!

09:48.889 --> 09:51.623
(Zapping)
(Thundering)

09:53.961 --> 09:55.760
Whoa!

09:56.396 --> 09:58.129
Are you guys okay?

09:58.131 --> 09:59.164
(Squeaking)

09:59.166 --> 10:01.266
Oh no, you're trapped!

10:01.268 --> 10:02.300
Hang on.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.201
(Grunting)

10:03.203 --> 10:06.271
I can't do this by myself!

10:06.273 --> 10:07.739
Ryder, it's Marshall.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.308
I need you and the
PAW Patrol right away!

10:10.310 --> 10:12.210
Right here, Marshall!
Aah!

10:12.212 --> 10:14.112
Chase, what are you doing here?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.748
We've all been looking
for you, Marshall.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.951

Zipline away.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.919
Ryder, Rubble!

10:20.921 --> 10:22.053
You guys got here just in time.

10:22.055 --> 10:25.256
Lightning hit a tree, and it
fell on top of a bunny burrow.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.459
One bunny ran off
into the woods,

10:27.461 --> 10:29.461
and the rest are trapped
in the burrow!

10:29.463 --> 10:31.963
RYDER:
Chase, find the lost bunny.

10:31.965 --> 10:32.964
Rubble, get your rig.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.001
Marshall, this tree
is still smouldering.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.268
You know what to do.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.005
I'm fired up!

10:40.007 --> 10:42.774
(Barking)
Water cannon!

10:46.213 --> 10:47.212
Great work, Marshall!

10:47.214 --> 10:49.848
Rubble, I need you
to lift this tree.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.350
Rubble on the double!

11:01.395 --> 11:05.196
Come on, bunnies.
You're safe now.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.900
Huh?

11:08.902 --> 11:10.368
You're okay, little guy.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.771

¶ P-P-P-PAW Patrol ¶

11:17.944 --> 11:20.278
So why were you
running away, Marshall?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.947
Because I mess everything up.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.215
Even the volleyball game.

11:24.217 --> 11:27.252
I heard you laughing at
what a silly pup I am.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.620
ALL:
No way, Marshall!

11:28.622 --> 11:30.021
We weren't talking about you.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.291
We were talking about the
bad guy in Apollo Super Pup!

11:33.293 --> 11:36.027
The PAW Patrol wouldn't
be the PAW Patrol

11:36.029 --> 11:37.829
without you, Marshall.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.064
(Laughing)

11:39.066 --> 11:40.565
ALL:
Yay, Marshall!

11:40.567 --> 11:42.167
You're all
such good pups!

11:42.169 --> 11:45.603
RUBBLE:
By the way, you owe us
a new volleyball.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.272

12:08.328 --> 12:11.730
Don't wanna run out of
squeaky toys on the trip!

12:11.732 --> 12:16.468
You did pack something warm
to wear too, didn't you?

12:16.470 --> 12:18.503
Uh...

12:18.505 --> 12:19.471
Uh-oh.

12:19.473 --> 12:20.739

12:38.558 --> 12:40.625
(Laughing)

12:40.961 --> 12:44.262

yourself, Marshall.

12:44.264 --> 12:44.929
(Laughing)

12:44.931 --> 12:48.833
It's great you're going to help
Jake and Everest count penguins.

your penguin fun, pups,

16:59.986 --> 17:02.754
but we have an
unexpected emergency.

17:02.756 --> 17:06.157
Somehow Cali snuck a ride
on the PAW Patroller,

17:06.159 --> 17:09.227
and then took Everest's
snowplow for a spin.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.996
It's out of control and
she needs to be rescued.

17:11.998 --> 17:16.067

a terrible driver.

stop the runaway snowplow.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.816
Chase is on the case!

17:31.818 --> 17:33.918
I'll try to get Cali
off the snowplow

17:33.920 --> 17:35.953

21:07.667 --> 21:09.166
(Meowing)

21:09.168 --> 21:10.768
Oh, she's
afraid to move.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.137
Can you reach her
with your buoy?

21:13.139 --> 21:14.505
Great idea!

21:14.507 --> 21:15.539
(Barking)

21:15.541 --> 21:17.575
Buoy!

21:17.577 --> 21:19.210
(Screeching)

21:19.212 --> 21:20.244
Got her!

21:20.246 --> 21:21.779
Nice job, Zuma!

21:21.781 --> 21:23.247
Hold on, Cali.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.316
We're heading for shore.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.585
(Meowing)

21:29.489 --> 21:30.321
(Chirping)

21:30.323 --> 21:33.190
Looks like that's the
last of the penguins.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.092
SKYE:
Got one more, Jake.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.762
Special delivery!

21:38.531 --> 21:41.499
(Chirping)

21:41.501 --> 21:43.834
You might wanna make
a note about this one.

21:43.836 --> 21:48.239
We can study the migration
habits of the wild Cali.

21:48.241 --> 21:51.342
(Laughing)

21:51.344 --> 21:52.243
(Purring)

21:52.245 --> 21:53.644
Aww, you're welcome, Cali!

21:53.646 --> 21:55.780
(Phone ringing)

21:55.782 --> 21:56.547
Hi, Katie.

21:56.549 --> 22:00.685
Guess who's going to be
so happy to be home?

22:00.687 --> 22:02.620
<i> Cali, you're safe!</i>

22:02.622 --> 22:03.854
(Purring)

22:03.856 --> 22:05.323
<i> Thanks, Ryder!</i>

22:05.325 --> 22:06.457
<i> Thanks, pups!</i>

22:06.459 --> 22:07.258
Thank Zuma.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.759
He's the one who saved her.

22:08.761 --> 22:09.560
(Giggling)

22:09.562 --> 22:13.431
And remember, if you ever need
us, just squawk for help.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.900
(Squawking)

22:15.902 --> 22:17.501
(Laughing)

22:17.503 --> 22:19.904
I think it's time
to warm up a little.

22:19.906 --> 22:22.606
You've all been very good pups.

¶ P-P-P-PAW Patrol ¶

22:27.613 --> 22:32.783
Boy, counting penguins
sure does make you hungry!

22:33.052 --> 22:36.320
Yeah, but this burnt
marshmallow doesn't.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.289
