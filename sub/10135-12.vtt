Hey, come on.

15:08.491 --> 15:12.912
Whoa! Gosh,

15:08.491 --> 15:12.912
nothing sweet about this.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.081
Should change me name

15:12.953 --> 15:15.081
to Poopeye, that's for sure.

15:15.122 --> 15:19.335
Oh, gosh. Okay, let's get

a young lady waving at you.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.502
Oh, yeah. I know.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.046
It's all part of the price I pay

for being

18:50.088 --> 18:52.172

Well, I don't want

18:52.214 --> 18:54.008
to make you jealous

18:54.050 --> 18:55.802
so I'm not even gonna look.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.054
No, really.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.054
You-you ought to look.

18:59.889 --> 19:03.267
Daddy, you got

18:59.889 --> 19:03.267
to try the happy meal.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.686
My God! It's my daughter!

19:05.728 --> 19:07.354
Michelle, how did you get here?

19:07.396 --> 19:10.441
In your car. We were

19:07.396 --> 19:10.441
hiding in the back seat.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.946
If we're in trouble,

19:10.483 --> 19:14.946
it was her idea.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.865
Well, you're both definitely in

19:14.988 --> 19:17.865
trouble. Please, into the booth.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.117
- Both of you.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.117
- Is everything alright?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.077
No, my daughter and her friend

19:21.119 --> 19:22.620
stowed away in my car.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.123
Michelle..

19:27.333 --> 19:28.876
...why did you do that?

19:28.918 --> 19:31.545
'Cause I never see you anymore.

19:31.587 --> 19:36.300
Is that because you're

19:31.587 --> 19:36.300

Eat your dessert, Teddy.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.264
you never see me anymore?

19:42.306 --> 19:43.474
I see you every morning.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.768
And I told you

19:43.516 --> 19:45.768
a bedtime story tonight.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.687
Before dinner doesn't count.

19:47.728 --> 19:51.440
You don't tuck me in anymore.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.110
Sweetheart, if I'm not able

19:51.482 --> 19:54.110
to tuck you in for some reason

19:54.152 --> 19:56.612
there's always someone else

19:54.152 --> 19:56.612
there to tuck you in.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.240
It's not the same.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.577
of a "toot toot."

20:05.038 --> 20:07.165
But that doesn't excuse you

20:05.038 --> 20:07.165
from leaving the house

20:07.206 --> 20:09.000
and sneaking into my car.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.711

Well...actually,

20:11.752 --> 20:16.549
it's not all your fault.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.552
I should've talked to you

20:16.590 --> 20:19.552
about this whole dating thing

20:19.593 --> 20:21.804
before I started

20:19.593 --> 20:21.804
going out every night.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.474
I know how important

20:23.222 --> 20:25.474
it is to you I tuck you in.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.309
It's important to me, too.

20:27.351 --> 20:30.021
I love our special

20:27.351 --> 20:30.021
times together.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.480
I'll tell you what.

20:31.522 --> 20:34.400
Why don't you and I

20:31.522 --> 20:34.400
make a special date

20:34.441 --> 20:38.071
tomorrow night at your bedtime

20:34.441 --> 20:38.071
for me to tuck you in?

20:38.112 --> 20:40.322
What do you say,

20:38.112 --> 20:40.322
is it a date?

20:40.364 --> 20:41.741
It's a date.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.077
I love you, honey.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.703
I love you, daddy.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.121
Aw.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.333
Danny, since we're all here

20:51.375 --> 20:53.878
why don't we make

20:51.375 --> 20:53.878
this a double date?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.504
Okay, well, if you'll excuse me

20:55.546 --> 20:57.882
I'll call home and tell them

20:55.546 --> 20:57.882
that the kids are okay.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.675
[Vicky chuckles]

20:59.717 --> 21:01.219
Wonder how much

20:59.717 --> 21:01.219
he tipped for that booth?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.220

21:02.261 --> 21:03.804
Excuse me.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.267
Here we go.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.269
This is okay

21:08.308 --> 21:10.269
with your daddy, right?

21:10.310 --> 21:13.064
Right.

21:13.106 --> 21:16.109
[laughs]

21:13.106 --> 21:16.109
I had a great time, Michelle.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.485
I hope

21:16.150 --> 21:18.485
we double-date again soon.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.362
Tomorrow's good for me.

Honey, why don't we go over

21:25.118 --> 21:27.286
when I come up

21:25.118 --> 21:27.286
to tuck you in, okay?

21:27.327 --> 21:30.206
I'll be waiting

21:27.327 --> 21:30.206
with the tugboat book.

21:30.248 --> 21:31.916
"Toot toot!"

He's still got it.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.553
Look, Vicky,

21:41.467 --> 21:44.553
uh...I'm sorry.

21:44.595 --> 21:47.848
This wasn't the scintillating

21:44.595 --> 21:47.848
evening I was hoping for.

21:47.890 --> 21:50.476
Actually, it was fun.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.686
I hope you don't mind

21:50.517 --> 21:52.686
if I tell our viewers

21:52.728 --> 21:55.022
you're a terrific dad.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.857
Thanks.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.735
Look, uh, I got

21:56.899 --> 21:59.735
a little carried away

21:59.777 --> 22:03.447
with all those women suddenly

21:59.777 --> 22:03.447

22:03.489 --> 22:07.493
Truth is, I'm not really

22:03.489 --> 22:07.493
a super stud bachelor.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.287
Somehow I knew that.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.416
You know. I'm just looking

22:10.997 --> 22:14.416
for somebody special.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.711
Yeah, I know what you mean, I'm

22:14.458 --> 22:17.711
going through the same thing.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.838
Really?

22:18.879 --> 22:20.173
Yeah.

22:21.799 --> 22:22.967
Well.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.593
- Goodnight.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.232
Oooohhhh.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.029
I'll be right up, honey.

Well, I'll see you

22:46.657 --> 22:48.408
at work tomorrow.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.244
Okay.

- Night.
