00:55.138 --> 00:56.723
Sure is humbling to see,
isn't it?

00:59.100 --> 01:00.894
Always is.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.645
What was the top speed?

01:02.645 --> 01:05.065
Got that at 122 miles an hour.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.399
I think we got
all the data we need.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.650
Okay.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.735
Well, let's pack it up, then.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.749
It's so early to be seeing
such extreme avalanche danger.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.626
Yes. Snow's come early
this year.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.879
Have you seen weather patterns
like this before?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.507
Well, not exactly, but similar.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.301
Weather patterns
are changing globally,

01:33.301 --> 01:35.136
so it's all a bit new to me.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.473
I'm gonna get a coffee.

01:38.473 --> 01:39.849
- Can I get you one?
- Sure.

01:39.849 --> 01:40.850
Thanks.

01:42.644 --> 01:43.812
Dr. Lawrence speaking.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.271
<i>Heather, it's Eric Johnson.</i>

01:45.271 --> 01:46.815
Eric!

01:46.815 --> 01:48.441
How are things in Fernie?

01:48.441 --> 01:51.444
Actually,
that's why I'm calling.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.862
I'm listening.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.406
I have a big favor to ask.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.700
Please tell me you're joking.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.826
<i>I know, it's bad timing.</i>

01:57.826 --> 01:59.119
<i>Bad?</i>

01:59.119 --> 02:00.245
<i>We are supposed
to leave tomorrow.</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:01.663
Couldn't you go
in a couple of weeks?

02:01.663 --> 02:03.123
<i>They need me to install
the forecasting equipment</i>

02:03.123 --> 02:04.332
<i>and train their staff</i>

02:04.332 --> 02:06.751
before they open
the backcountry to skiers.

02:06.751 --> 02:07.669
<i>Of course, they do.</i>

02:08.837 --> 02:09.629
The weather's
been out of whack recently

02:09.629 --> 02:10.630
and it's become

02:10.630 --> 02:11.631
a whole insurance thing
for them.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.966
Eric said it can't wait.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.385
<i>Plus, installing my system
on their mountain</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:17.637
will be great exposure.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.264
Which is exactly what I need
to secure another grant.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.182
<i>I'm sorry to cancel,</i>

02:21.182 --> 02:22.642
but I have to go.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.727
<i>I was just so excited</i>

02:23.727 --> 02:25.854
about spending a week in Maui.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.273
If I have to listen

02:28.273 --> 02:30.358
to one more model
tell me how to do my job,

02:30.358 --> 02:32.986
I am going to lose my mind.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.321
<i>Plus, Charlie and I</i>

02:35.321 --> 02:37.157
could probably use
a little break,

02:37.157 --> 02:38.658
it's been intense for us.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.327
How's everything going
with that?

02:41.327 --> 02:42.287
<i>On the fertility front?</i>

02:42.287 --> 02:44.706
Well, nothing to report,

02:44.706 --> 02:46.666
except I am out of money

02:46.666 --> 02:49.294
and this my last shot
of getting pregnant.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.005
<i>Which I thought
the Hawaiian weather</i>

02:52.005 --> 02:53.840
<i>and time with my sister
would help with.</i>

02:55.216 --> 02:57.302
Well, why not just come
to Fernie Glacier with me?

02:57.302 --> 02:58.636
It'll be just as good.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.889
Just as good as warm sun
and clear waters?

03:00.889 --> 03:02.432
Yeah.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.017
They're putting me up
at this five-star resort--

03:04.017 --> 03:06.019
well, in a mountain-five-star
sort of way.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.562
What's the weather in Glacier
right now?

03:07.562 --> 03:09.314
Last I checked,
it was 12 degrees.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.232
Uh, no, I can't tan
in 12-degree weather.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.234
<i>Come on, Riley.</i>

03:13.234 --> 03:15.362
It's been forever since
we've been on a sisters' trip.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.488
And Fernie is one of

03:16.488 --> 03:18.156
the most beautiful mountains
on Earth.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.075
Well, I'm not arguing that.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.034
<i>I have to work,</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:22.744
but we'll have so much fun.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.662
We'll go snowmobiling,
dog-sledding, skiing,

03:24.662 --> 03:26.039
hot-tubbing.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.957
Ooh, maybe I can set you up

03:27.957 --> 03:30.210
with some
hot, rugged-mountain type.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.003
Okay, that wasn't
exactly on the list.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.546
Well, it should be.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.964
Does that mean you're coming?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.943
This is exciting.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.236
Oh, this looks great. See?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.487
Who needs Hawaii?

03:57.487 --> 03:58.530
Oh, it's so beautiful.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.833
- Heather!
- Hey! Eric!

04:09.833 --> 04:12.669
- It's so good to see you.
- It's so good to see you!

04:12.669 --> 04:14.838
This is my sister, Riley.
Riley, this is Eric.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.131
We're friends from college.

04:16.131 --> 04:17.424
Oh! How good friends?

04:17.424 --> 04:19.300
Heather actually
introduced me to my wife.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.386
No way, she introduced me
to my husband.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.763
Oh. Avalanche expert
and matchmaker?

04:23.763 --> 04:26.307
You got a pretty nice resume, Heather.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.977
If only she was as good
at matchmaking for herself.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.437
She's still single, I take it?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.022
- Mm-hmm.
- Still happily single.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.274
Still using
the same lingo, too, huh?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.651
Oh, my gosh,
you're as bad as Riley.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.986
Come on in.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.156
Seriously, though,

04:41.156 --> 04:43.408
I really appreciate you coming,
and on such short notice.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.617
With the storm coming in,

04:44.617 --> 04:46.161
flights are gonna start
getting canceled,

04:46.161 --> 04:47.996
and I'll feel
way more comfortable

04:47.996 --> 04:49.581
opening the backcountry

04:49.581 --> 04:50.957
with your forecasting system
all set up and ready.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.083
Well, like I said,

04:52.083 --> 04:53.752
I'm excited
for the opportunity.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.338
Well, with global warming
and the snowpack this year,

04:56.338 --> 04:57.714
our insurance feels more secure
with you here, too.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.425
But, mostly, I'm super excited

05:00.425 --> 05:01.968
about you training
our Mountain Rescue team.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.136
You know,
getting them up to speed

05:03.136 --> 05:04.471
with the advantages

05:04.471 --> 05:06.306
of incorporating
your technology with their work.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.807
Once they see how it works,

05:07.807 --> 05:09.142
everyone will be on board.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.977
Yeah, um...

05:10.977 --> 05:12.687
I should probably fill you in
on something about that.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.315
Uh-oh, what's that?

05:15.315 --> 05:19.736
Well, it's more of a someone
than a something.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.029
You might get some pushback
from our director.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.865
Why would your director
give me pushback?

05:23.865 --> 05:24.866
It's complicated--

05:24.866 --> 05:26.743
but the good news is

05:26.743 --> 05:28.036
I think you might be able
to win him over.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.997
Well, thanks for the heads-up.
I'll do my best.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.582
You know,
our Mountain Rescue team

05:32.582 --> 05:34.501
is doing
an avalanche demonstration.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.335
Maybe you two
wanna check it out

05:35.335 --> 05:36.294
after you get settled?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.671
Absolutely.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.922
Great.
I'll check you guys in.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.131
Sounds good.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.175
Uh, hey, Jacinda,
we got two new guests.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.052
Hi, how are you today?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.428
Good, thank you.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.105
I'm so glad
we're here together.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.564
Me too.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.858
I mean, this place is cold,
but it's absolutely...

05:58.858 --> 06:01.861
Hot, hunky, and super-hot
straight ahead.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.071
Hello, everyone.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.197
My name is Chris Parker,

06:04.197 --> 06:05.407
and I wanna welcome you all

06:05.407 --> 06:06.950
to our avalanche-rescue
demonstration.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.118
Great voice.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.412
Strong jawline.
Five o'clock shadow.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.539
Bet he's super ripped
under that jacket of his.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.498
Shh.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.624
Now, our avalanche dogs--

06:14.624 --> 06:16.876
or "avi dogs," as we call them--

06:16.876 --> 06:18.378
are some of

06:18.378 --> 06:20.130
the most important members
of our avalanche team.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.965
Now, these pups--

06:21.965 --> 06:23.383
they're currently in training,

06:23.383 --> 06:25.135
but once they graduate,

06:25.135 --> 06:27.053
they will officially become
part of Mountain Rescue.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.556
I know what you're thinking.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.933
"These pups are too cute
to be rescue dogs."

06:31.933 --> 06:33.184
True, they're cute,

06:33.184 --> 06:34.728
but one day soon,

06:34.728 --> 06:36.479
they're gonna be out there
in the backcountry saving lives.

06:37.981 --> 06:41.401
Now, this here is Mogul,
one of our veteran dogs.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.069
There is nothing
Mogul can't find

06:43.069 --> 06:44.154
that's underneath the snow.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.948
What do you think, buddy,
you wanna try it out?

06:46.948 --> 06:49.284
Okay. Ready?

06:49.284 --> 06:50.702
Go get 'em!

06:51.786 --> 06:53.121
Nice.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.040
I've hidden
a backpack in the snow

06:55.040 --> 06:57.709
that simulates a person
buried in an avalanche.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.794
Now, Mogul is trained
to sniff out and locate.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.798
Oh.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.261
Look at him go!

07:08.261 --> 07:09.971
Good boy, Mogul!

07:14.184 --> 07:15.769
Whoo!

07:15.769 --> 07:17.437
Atta boy.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.564
All right, can I please have
a volunteer?

07:19.564 --> 07:21.733
Oh, get your hand up.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.110
- He needs a volunteer.
- I don't want to.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.403
Volunteer
for a ruggedly-handsome,

07:25.403 --> 07:26.946
great-haired, sexy-eyed
mountain man? Please.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.114
Riley, it's not the time.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.492
Here's your volunteer!
Right here.

07:30.492 --> 07:31.659
Great, come on up.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.120
Thanks a lot.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.163
You're so welcome.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.418
What is your name?

07:40.418 --> 07:41.711
- Heather.
- Heather.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.213
Thank you
for volunteering, Heather.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.506
Glad to be of service.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.716
Okay, what we're gonna do now

07:46.716 --> 07:49.094
is simulate someone
being buried in an avalanche.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.304
Not sure you can actually
simulate that, can you?

07:51.304 --> 07:52.681
Expert in the field?

07:52.681 --> 07:54.599
I know a thing or two.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.810
Wow. Well, I'm sure you do,

07:56.810 --> 07:58.520
but I think I wanna teach you
just a little bit more.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.938
How's that sound?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.648
Well, all right, then.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.483
Okay.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.485
So, what we're gonna do
is bury Heather in the hole,

08:05.485 --> 08:08.154
so we can demonstrate
what an actual rescue is like.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.491
And just to clarify,
he's not gonna bury me-bury me,

08:11.491 --> 08:12.992
there's a pre-built hole
within there

08:12.992 --> 08:14.244
that I'll safety be in.

08:15.537 --> 08:16.663
I'm pretty sure
they assumed that.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.665
However, it's never safe
to assume anything

08:18.665 --> 08:20.875
when it comes
to avalanche-rescue missions.

08:20.875 --> 08:21.876
That's true.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.629
Okay.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.006
Well, I want you
to hold this. Okay?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.340
And hold this strong
when you're rescued.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.508
You got it?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.759
Hold it strong?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.219
Hold it strong.
Let's go.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.517
All right, well, there you go.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.643
Just feet first in there.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.063
All right, really good.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.398
Okay. You got this.

08:43.398 --> 08:46.026
Should you ever be buried
in an avalanche,

08:46.026 --> 08:47.360
within minutes,

08:47.360 --> 08:48.695
you'll start
to run out of oxygen.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.197
Now, most people
in this situation will panic,

08:51.197 --> 08:52.907
which is natural,

08:52.907 --> 08:55.869
but remaining calm
will preserve your oxygen

08:55.869 --> 08:58.079
and increase the amount of time
you can survive under the snow.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.375
Now, these extra
critical minutes

09:02.375 --> 09:04.627
gives us more time
to get to you,

09:04.627 --> 09:06.796
which could mean the difference
between life and death.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.591
All right, Mogul, search!

09:10.717 --> 09:11.718
Come on.
Here you go, buddy.

09:13.595 --> 09:14.637
Nice. Nice.
Good job.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.101
Oh, wow.

09:23.104 --> 09:23.980
Good boy!

09:25.106 --> 09:26.649
Good boy, good boy.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.736
Here we go. Oh!

09:29.736 --> 09:31.696
All right, let's have
a big round of applause

09:31.696 --> 09:33.114
for our brave volunteer,
Heather!

09:34.157 --> 09:35.658
Whoo!

09:35.658 --> 09:36.910
And for the heroes
of our rescue,

09:36.910 --> 09:38.119
Mogul,

09:38.119 --> 09:39.996
and the newest member
of our team, Bosco!

09:43.083 --> 09:44.584
Wow, very impressive.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.544
This is my sister, Riley.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.962
Oh, hey, Riley.
Nice to meet you.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.255
Nice to meet you!

09:50.590 --> 09:51.841
I'm curious.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.760
Uh, your gloves,
do they, um, hold the heat?

09:54.969 --> 09:56.012
Hold the heat?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.097
Yeah, keep the heat.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.640
You know, are they...
are they warm?

09:58.640 --> 10:00.809
Just, uh, thinking
of getting my sister a pair.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.602
I don't need any need
any gloves, Riley.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.604
Yes, you do.
You think you don't, but you do.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.814
Uh, yeah, they're--
they're great.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.273
They-- They hold the heat.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.317
I'd-- I'd recommend a pair,
if you wanna get some.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.694
Can I, uh, try them on?

10:10.694 --> 10:12.153
Just for a second.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.321
A mere minute.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.783
Oh, yes, those are warm.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.078
Very warm. Dry.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.538
Plus nice hands, too.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.664
Big hands.

10:22.664 --> 10:23.790
Uh, okay.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.625
I notice that
you don't have a ring on.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.794
Just not into jewelry.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.755
Oh. Like, you're married
and don't wear the ring? Or--

10:30.755 --> 10:33.091
Okay. Don't mind my sister.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.718
My mom used to call her
"Nosey Nelly".

10:35.677 --> 10:37.387
No, uh, just, not married,

10:37.387 --> 10:39.139
and, uh,
just don't like jewelry.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.725
I'm married--
happily married--

10:41.725 --> 10:44.602
but my, uh, sister here,
AKA Miss Mountain Woman...

10:44.602 --> 10:46.021
Miss Mountain Woman?

10:46.021 --> 10:48.106
Well, I've never met
a mountain woman

10:48.106 --> 10:49.607
from the city before.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.067
Back to assumptions, I see.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.570
Well, I've never
seen you here, for one.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.947
And two,
unless you live here...

10:55.947 --> 10:57.365
I don't think you really
know much about avalanches.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.493
Which I indicated
I did earlier.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.911
Heather actually
knows a lot--

11:01.911 --> 11:03.329
Dad, I think
Bosco might be hungry.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.622
Oh, hey, kiddo.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.916
Everyone, this is
my daughter, Samantha.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.710
And she trains the avi pups.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.504
Wow, trains the avalanche pups?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.006
That's a very important job.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.799
Thanks.
I like to think so.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.469
Oh, I like your earrings.
I have the same ones.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.098
Oh, looks like we both have
exceptional taste in jewelry.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.183
Seems we do.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.517
Well, it's nice to meet you, Samantha.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.019
Nice to meet you, too.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.520
All right, ladies,
we gotta take the dogs back.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.688
I hope to see you guys around.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.106
You never know.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.233
Nice to meet you,
Miss Mountain Expert.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.236
- Bye, Samantha.
- Bye.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.531
Um...

11:38.531 --> 11:39.949
did we seriously just meet

11:39.949 --> 11:41.868
an ultra-hot,
single mountain-ski dude

11:41.868 --> 11:43.328
that is totally your type,

11:43.328 --> 11:45.705
and has the cutest tween and dog
one could ever ask for?

11:45.705 --> 11:48.291
First off, did you see
how presumptuous he was?

11:48.291 --> 11:49.751
That was him flirting.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.127
That was him
being condescending.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.671
Oh, come on.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.047
I feel like you say that about
every guy that hits on you.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.256
Not true.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.716
That was not hitting on me.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.718
And you have no idea
if he's single.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.595
All you know
is that he's not married.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.389
And, as I told you before,

12:02.389 --> 12:03.848
I'm not here to find a guy.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.475
Yeah, you never want
to find a guy,

12:05.475 --> 12:07.769
hence why you are
perpetually single.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.230
Because I prefer to prioritize
my work over men.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.481
Is that so bad?

12:12.899 --> 12:15.443
And spend quality time
with my big sis.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.197
And, um, can we talk about
your hormones?

12:19.197 --> 12:20.740
Because I know you said
the fertility treatments

12:20.740 --> 12:21.741
lit them on fire.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.118
You have no idea.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.787
Aside from the fact

12:25.787 --> 12:27.414
that I think you drooled
when you were talking to Chris.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.873
- Oh, come on, you didn't?
- Mm-mm.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.507
Okay.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.968
There you go.
You comfy?

12:39.968 --> 12:41.261
Mm-hmm.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.722
Okay, bedtime question.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.682
Tell me biggest thing
that made you smile today.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.934
That's easy--
being with you.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.103
Well, it's the same for me
every day, sweetie.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.604
Anything else?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.523
Watching the dogs work.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.607
It's just so cool
how smart they are.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.776
Dogs that save lives.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.570
Doesn't get smarter
in the canine department

12:58.570 --> 12:59.863
than that.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.114
And I'm happy you have them.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.491
To help, you know,
keep you safe at work.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.620
Hey, I'm as safe
as safe can be, sweetie.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.913
Good.

13:09.748 --> 13:10.832
All right.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.250
Now, don't hold back

13:12.250 --> 13:13.877
and give me everything you got
in the hug department.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.964
You're so strong.

13:19.674 --> 13:20.967
I love you, Dad.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.052
I love you more, sweetie.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.555
Okay. Night-night, okay?

13:47.619 --> 13:49.412
This place
hasn't changed a bit.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.497
Wait, you've been here before?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.831
During college.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.124
Wes and I road-tripped
out here once.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.417
Wes.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.044
Wow, that's a name
I haven't heard in a while.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.212
What's he up to these days?

13:57.212 --> 13:59.547
Last I checked,
he was married with kids.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.383
See, that could have been you.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.342
Would have made Mom happy.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.677
Seriously?

14:03.677 --> 14:05.095
What?

14:05.095 --> 14:06.346
Me being married
to some dude

14:06.346 --> 14:09.099
who hates the outdoors
and is a lazy thug

14:09.099 --> 14:10.350
would not have made Mom happy.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.019
You need to stop pushing
that old-fashioned narrative

14:13.019 --> 14:16.022
about me needing
or finding a man.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.400
You're starting to sound like
one of those old romance movies.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.028
Relax, I just mean
that Mom wants grandkids,

14:22.028 --> 14:23.530
and Wes could have been
that ticket.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.574
Except you, my dear sister,
are gonna be that ticket.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.868
So fill me in on that.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.495
Where are we at?

14:30.495 --> 14:33.456
Well, Charlie and I went to see
the fertility specialist

14:33.456 --> 14:35.125
two weeks ago.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.669
Got that last batch of swimmers
in and up,

14:37.669 --> 14:40.588
with the hope
that it takes and sticks.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.216
This is the third round of IVF?

14:43.216 --> 14:44.426
Yeah.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.635
And the last.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.387
We've spent
every dollar we have.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.557
We just simply
can't afford to go again.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.100
Well, let's send
positive vibes.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.019
I'm afraid we might need
more than that.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.188
Hey!

14:57.188 --> 14:59.315
Hey, in there,
little Charlie swimmers,

14:59.315 --> 15:00.233
if you can hear me,

15:00.233 --> 15:01.735
just head north,

15:01.735 --> 15:02.652
find those eggs,

15:02.652 --> 15:03.903
and settle in.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.946
You can do it.
I know you can do it.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.782
Don't mind her,

15:07.782 --> 15:08.908
she's just directing
my husband's swimmers.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.201
If you know what I mean.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.205
More water?

15:28.261 --> 15:30.388
All right, looks like
everyone is all here.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.473
Before we get started,

15:31.473 --> 15:33.099
did everyone try
my baking in the back?

15:33.099 --> 15:36.102
It's banana croissants
and the theme for today.

15:37.896 --> 15:38.980
Look, I understand

15:38.980 --> 15:40.065
some of you are still skeptical

15:40.065 --> 15:41.441
about my baking
from last meeting,

15:41.441 --> 15:42.567
but it's a hobby,

15:42.567 --> 15:44.110
and hobbies take work.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.320
And let me tell you,

15:45.320 --> 15:46.988
my banana croissants
are tasting pretty good.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.448
Am I right?

15:48.448 --> 15:49.699
See, he knows.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.284
Much better than
the peanut butter ones

15:51.284 --> 15:52.952
from last week.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.662
Okay, I'll just feed them
to the dogs,

15:54.662 --> 15:55.914
and we'll get started.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.667
Um, good morning, everyone.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.001
Uh, I see some of you

16:00.001 --> 16:01.961
may have noticed
we have a new face in the room.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.880
And not only
is she a dear friend of mine,

16:03.880 --> 16:05.882
she's also

16:05.882 --> 16:08.635
one of North America's foremost
snow and avalanche experts.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.011
Dr. Heather Lawrence

16:10.011 --> 16:11.763
is here to tell us
about a system she developed

16:11.763 --> 16:13.098
that's gonna take

16:13.098 --> 16:14.099
avalanche forecasting
and risk management

16:14.099 --> 16:15.517
to a new level.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.893
Something we all know
is most welcome

16:16.893 --> 16:18.103
in this neck of the woods,

16:18.103 --> 16:19.646
and that's preventing
the loss of life

16:19.646 --> 16:20.814
and keeping everyone safe.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.190
So, let's give
a big, nice welcome

16:22.190 --> 16:23.650
for Heather Lawrence.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.114
Thanks, Eric.

16:29.114 --> 16:30.448
Working here in Fernie

16:30.448 --> 16:33.076
at amazing Rocky Mountain
Glacier National Park

16:33.076 --> 16:34.411
has always been a dream of mine,

16:34.411 --> 16:36.496
so I was very grateful
for the invitation.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.791
To fully understand
what causes an avalanche,

16:39.791 --> 16:42.293
we begin with one of nature's
most magnificent creations.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.548
Um, something so small,
it's almost weightless.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.384
So intricate in detail,

16:49.384 --> 16:51.594
each one is an original
and exquisite work of art.

16:51.594 --> 16:54.681
What I'm talking about,
of course, is the snowflake.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.852
This is a stellar dendrite,

16:58.852 --> 17:00.645
one of the most beautiful
of all snowflakes.

17:03.898 --> 17:04.941
But it's also the most deadly.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.401
On average,

17:06.401 --> 17:09.904
27 people in the U.S.
die each year in an avalanche.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.282
Unfortunately,
that number is trending up.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.200
But avalanches
not only take lives,

17:14.200 --> 17:15.535
but they destroy roads,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.120
disrupt commerce,

17:17.120 --> 17:19.039
and cause millions of dollars
in damage.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.540
The economic impact
in recent years

17:20.540 --> 17:21.833
has been significant.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.086
So, how do we improve
our forecasting

17:25.086 --> 17:27.047
to save more lives
and minimize damage?

17:27.047 --> 17:28.340
By collecting more data

17:28.340 --> 17:30.592
and utilizing
the latest technology

17:30.592 --> 17:31.468
to process that data.

17:38.641 --> 17:41.102
Well, hello, sunshine.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.742
Oh, don't mind me,
I was supposed to be in Hawaii,

17:55.742 --> 17:57.369
so just working on my tan.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.876
Yeah, sounds good.

18:04.876 --> 18:05.919
Talk soon.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.296
Okay.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.756
I just got off the phone
with my colleagues

18:09.756 --> 18:13.718
in Yosemite, Grand Teton,
Olympic, even Whistler Mountain,

18:13.718 --> 18:15.303
and they're all excited
about what you're doing here.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.681
If your system
proves to be effective,

18:17.681 --> 18:19.099
it's gonna be in high demand.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.183
I appreciate you
putting the word out.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.351
Well, of course.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.269
Oh. And so,
we, uh, built your tower

18:23.269 --> 18:25.188
and loaded the snowcat
with all your equipment

18:25.188 --> 18:26.439
to get it up the mountain.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.857
Amazing.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.110
I'd also like to install
these smaller monitoring systems

18:30.110 --> 18:31.486
in these other locations.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.321
It'll allow us to collect
enough information

18:33.321 --> 18:35.448
to cover the whole terrain.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.991
Oh, I love it.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.743
And once it's up and running,
we can open the backcountry.

18:38.743 --> 18:39.953
'Cause we've had skiers

18:39.953 --> 18:41.663
practically waiting
at the gates.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.123
And, unfortunately,

18:43.123 --> 18:44.290
we've had some boarders

18:44.290 --> 18:46.418
sneaking in
to catch some fresh powder,

18:46.418 --> 18:47.627
which is always worrisome.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.045
I'm on it.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.338
Well, great.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.631
Uh, I'll get Chris Parker
to take you up.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.133
He's our director.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.509
Actually, I think
you've met him already.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.219
We have?

18:56.219 --> 18:57.470
Yeah, he's the one

18:57.470 --> 18:58.555
who did the avalanche demo
the other day.

18:58.555 --> 19:01.725
Oh!

19:01.725 --> 19:04.686
Yes. Yes, I-- I have.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.479
I didn't realize
that was your director.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.605
Oh, he sure is.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.107
And, like I said,

19:09.107 --> 19:10.817
he's the one that needs
a little bit of the convincing.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.027
So, it's pretty good

19:12.027 --> 19:13.611
that you two will get
some alone time.

19:13.611 --> 19:14.946
Alone?

19:14.946 --> 19:16.573
Like alone-alone?

19:16.573 --> 19:17.323
Just the two of us?

19:17.323 --> 19:19.200
Just the two of you.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.288
- What's with the look?
- What look?

19:23.288 --> 19:24.789
Oh, I know that look.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.291
- No, you don't.
- I do.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.376
Chris, it's Eric.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.544
Dr. Lawrence is ready for you.

19:31.963 --> 19:32.881
He's single by the way.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.008
- Not that you asked.
- I didn't.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.611
Of course.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.156
You know, in the mountains,

20:40.156 --> 20:41.825
there's no substitute
for experience,

20:41.825 --> 20:42.826
knowledge,

20:42.826 --> 20:44.703

20:44.703 --> 20:46.663
People rely too much
on computers these days.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.498
But up here?

20:48.498 --> 20:50.375
You rely too much on computers,
it can cost you.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.378

mountain-avalanche purists?

20:54.379 --> 20:55.380

21:00.844 --> 21:02.053
Clearly.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.847
Anyway, the, uh,
station is up there.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.849

21:05.849 --> 21:06.975
Mm-hmm.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.359
And there you have it.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.986
Looks perfect.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.029
Yeah, well, it better be.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.196
Cost a mountain to build it.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.364
Not that you asked,

21:21.364 --> 21:22.657
but just so you know,

21:22.657 --> 21:24.868
this equipment will send data
to the server,

21:24.868 --> 21:27.495
where my algorithm
will assess the avalanche risk,

21:27.495 --> 21:29.247
and give a far better reading

21:29.247 --> 21:30.790
than we've ever been able
to achieve remotely.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.835
Huh.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.503
Well, I still don't trust it
over my own assessment.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.797
And your own assessment
being...?

21:39.174 --> 21:40.467
Oh, just call it
the old-school way.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.763
First of all,

21:44.763 --> 21:46.389
we take the temperature
from here.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.350
Then, over here,

21:48.350 --> 21:49.934
we have a magnifying glass
to look at the crystals.

21:51.436 --> 21:52.854
And behind me over there
on the boards,

21:52.854 --> 21:54.689
that's where we measure
the new snow and the settlement.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.233
Then, with this,

21:57.233 --> 21:59.069
we take a sample
and put it in a tube.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.362
We weigh it

22:00.362 --> 22:02.822
to get the water equivalent
and density.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.240
And then we determine
if there's a weak layer,

22:04.240 --> 22:05.241
which may cause an avalanche.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.242
Like you said,

22:06.242 --> 22:07.619
very old-school.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.287
Well, call it what you want,

22:09.287 --> 22:12.624
but I like to walk in it,
touch it, taste it.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.417
You know,
measure it in real life,

22:14.417 --> 22:15.251
not on a computer screen.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.211
Hmm.

22:17.295 --> 22:18.713
Fresh powder.

22:21.216 --> 22:22.509
Yeah.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.802
Yeah, the best of the best.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.640
But I assumed you weren't,
you know, really a skier.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.475
There we go
with the assumptions again.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.603
Well, I'm just saying,
the mountain's...

22:33.603 --> 22:34.854
the mountain's
pretty big, you know?

22:34.854 --> 22:35.689
I was actually hoping
to get in a few runs.

22:35.689 --> 22:36.731
Obviously, not backcountry,

22:36.731 --> 22:38.483
but who can refuse powder?

22:40.735 --> 22:42.320
Okay, we can take a few runs.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.905
I'm sure I can get someone
from the office

22:43.905 --> 22:44.906
to drive down the CAT.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.449
That'd be great.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.410
But you don't have
your equipment, do you?

22:48.410 --> 22:49.619
My gear's in the CAT.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.206

23:21.484 --> 23:22.902
Yeah. Yeah, as a skier.

But seriously,

23:25.113 --> 23:26.364

such a strong female skier.

Impressive.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.870

we've gotta get going.

spa treatments.

Oh.

Riley, it's been

24:08.156 --> 24:09.366
Well, perfect.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.825
Hey, this trip
can't all be about work.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.869
You promised me pampering.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.704
And you, my dear sister,
need a massage.

24:16.414 --> 24:17.499
Twist my arm.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.167
Go get your bathing suit.
Hurry up!

24:28.218 --> 24:29.219
Okay, you were right.

24:29.219 --> 24:30.387
This isn't so bad.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.346
I told you.

24:33.223 --> 24:34.224
Cheers!

24:34.224 --> 24:35.600
Cheers.

- Okay.

24:40.605 --> 24:41.856
Right this way.

24:45.318 --> 24:46.236
It was a deer.

24:46.236 --> 24:47.612
No. No, I mean...

24:47.612 --> 24:48.988
Maybe it was an elk?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.782
No. Remember,
elks' antlers go like this,

24:50.782 --> 24:51.908
deer antlers go like this,

24:51.908 --> 24:52.909
and moose ant--

- Oh.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.247
Ah...

24:57.247 --> 24:58.498
I'm sorry.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.250
It's okay.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.293
Hi, Chris!

25:02.293 --> 25:03.253
Riley, right?

25:03.253 --> 25:04.379
Good memory.

25:04.379 --> 25:05.547
Yeah. Hi again.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.298
Hi.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.591
My sister booked
massages for us.

25:08.591 --> 25:10.510
I figured.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.470
Yeah, this is
the place to come.

25:12.470 --> 25:13.847
I have a, uh, old injury

25:13.847 --> 25:15.598
and my back
freezes up sometimes,

25:15.598 --> 25:17.767
so I come here
to work out the tension a bit.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.144
Oh.

25:19.144 --> 25:21.104
Well, I hope our run today
didn't make things worse.

25:22.105 --> 25:23.106
Maybe.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.315
Maybe not.

25:24.315 --> 25:25.775
But I would never tell.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.610
You're a pretty good skier,
by the way.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.987
I don't think I told you that.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.280
Thank you.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.449
I appreciate that.

25:32.449 --> 25:33.658
Especially coming from someone

25:33.658 --> 25:34.909
who really knows her way
around the mountain.

25:34.909 --> 25:36.911
Oh, so now I know my way
around the mountain?

25:36.911 --> 25:37.829
Interesting.

25:37.829 --> 25:39.122
Mm-hmm.

25:40.373 --> 25:41.791
Um...

25:41.791 --> 25:43.793
Sorry, this is, uh, Sonya.

25:43.793 --> 25:46.338
Looks like she's gonna be
your therapist today.

25:46.338 --> 25:47.547
She's the best.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.757
Great hands.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.804
Because I just got
a session from her.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.139
Um...

25:56.139 --> 25:57.807
I'm gonna go.

25:57.807 --> 25:58.975
We'll, uh--
We'll see you guys later.

25:58.975 --> 26:00.310
Yeah.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.311
Excuse me.

26:01.311 --> 26:02.479
Bye!

26:02.479 --> 26:03.438
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:05.398 --> 26:06.399
Heather Lawrence?

26:06.399 --> 26:07.567
Yes, that's me.

26:07.567 --> 26:08.777
Come on in.

26:10.904 --> 26:11.905
Okay...

26:14.866 --> 26:17.369
Go ahead and lie face down
on the table.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.041
Okay.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.508
So, how do you know Chris?

26:31.508 --> 26:32.676
Oh, we just, uh...

26:32.676 --> 26:34.135
we just met.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.804
I'm here doing work
for mountain rescue and safety,

26:35.804 --> 26:37.347
and he was helping me out today.

26:37.347 --> 26:38.682
Oh, you just met?

26:38.682 --> 26:40.016
I thought you two
might have known each other,

26:40.016 --> 26:41.434
the way you laid your eyes
all over him.

26:42.727 --> 26:43.812
Excuse me?

26:43.812 --> 26:45.522
Looked at him, I mean.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.857
Oh. I didn't realize
I was doing that.

26:48.817 --> 26:49.859
Like Kourtney on Travis.

26:50.860 --> 26:51.611
- Who?
- Kardashian.

26:51.611 --> 26:52.946
Fave show.

26:54.072 --> 26:55.407
Got it.

26:55.407 --> 26:57.117
Um, is there any way
we could go a little bit softer?

26:57.117 --> 26:58.493
Oh, yes, of course.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.538
It's just that deep tissue
is kind of my speciality.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.373
Especially after
a long ski day.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.000
Which you had
today with Chris?

27:06.418 --> 27:07.377
Oh, no, it was just...

27:07.377 --> 27:08.420
it was just one run.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.879
How did you meet again?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.799
- Who?
- Cute Chris.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.217
That's my nickname for him.

27:14.217 --> 27:15.719
Um, work.

27:15.719 --> 27:18.596
I met Cute Chris
through work.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.181
Which is?

27:20.181 --> 27:21.391
I'm a scientist.

27:21.391 --> 27:23.727
I specialize in
weather patterns,

27:23.727 --> 27:25.437
avalanche forecasting, and such.

27:25.437 --> 27:26.938
I see.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.649
I don't think I can do
the deep tissue.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.152
He and I just went
on a date, actually.

27:32.152 --> 27:34.738
Just one date,
but it went really well.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.489
He's very nice.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.074
Very nice.

27:38.074 --> 27:39.701
I see.

27:39.701 --> 27:42.245
Nice is-- is really good
for a first date.

27:42.245 --> 27:43.913
We had sushi.

27:43.913 --> 27:46.416
It was fresh, you know?

27:46.416 --> 27:47.959
Caught straight
from the river.

27:47.959 --> 27:52.088
I'm okay with farmed,
but he likes wild.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.465
Which I love.

27:53.465 --> 27:55.759
Um...

27:55.759 --> 27:59.763
it's still
a little too hard.

27:59.763 --> 28:01.806
So, tell me,
how long are you in town for?

28:06.644 --> 28:07.645
Hey!

28:07.645 --> 28:10.440
What happened to you?

28:10.440 --> 28:11.775
Well, let's just say

28:11.775 --> 28:13.360
I need a massage
from my massage.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.903
Why?

28:14.903 --> 28:16.237
Well, Sonya the masseuse

28:16.237 --> 28:18.531
seems to be as infatuated
with Chris as you are.

28:18.531 --> 28:19.657
No way.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.868
Yes way.

28:21.868 --> 28:22.952
Remind me next time

28:22.952 --> 28:24.496
to steer clear of massages

28:24.496 --> 28:25.538
from girls
my colleague is dating.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.123
Wait, it's his girlfriend?

28:27.123 --> 28:28.041
I don't know.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.335
She said they went on a date.

28:30.335 --> 28:31.753
TMI, if you ask me.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.088
She's probably just jealous.

28:34.422 --> 28:35.757
Why would she be jealous?

28:35.757 --> 28:37.467
Ah, please.

28:37.467 --> 28:38.593
And you don't think
she noticed

28:38.593 --> 28:39.511
the way you two
looked at each other?

28:39.511 --> 28:41.304
Talking about your ski day.

28:41.304 --> 28:43.014
Which, by the way,
you still haven't told me about.

28:43.014 --> 28:45.642
But you two practically
set off the fire alarm.

28:45.642 --> 28:46.601
The fire alarm?

28:46.601 --> 28:47.560
The fire alarm.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.270
You like him.

28:49.270 --> 28:50.355
No, I don't.

28:50.355 --> 28:51.564
- Yes, you do!
- I do not.

28:51.564 --> 28:52.649
- Yes, you do.
- I do not. You know nothing.

28:52.649 --> 28:54.234
I know everything,
I'm your sister.

28:54.234 --> 28:55.402
And I know
we need to go for a steam.

28:55.402 --> 28:56.861
Come on!

29:05.370 --> 29:06.871
Oh, it's Charlie.
I'm just gonna get this.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.748
Hey, sweetie.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.750
Yeah, I miss you, too.

29:10.750 --> 29:11.751
Yeah.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.003
She's right here. Yep.

29:13.003 --> 29:14.337
Charlie says hi.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.755
Hi, Charlie.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.132
Hey, do you mind grabbing me
something to go?

29:17.132 --> 29:18.174
I'll meet you in the room.

29:18.174 --> 29:20.260
- Yeah.
- Okay, thanks.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.803
Yeah.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.722
No, I'm-- I'm trying
not to think about it.

29:23.722 --> 29:25.765
No, sweetheart,
there's no positives.

29:25.765 --> 29:26.558
I would obviously tell you.

29:29.144 --> 29:30.228
Heather?

29:31.604 --> 29:33.106
Oh. Hi...

29:33.106 --> 29:34.441
again.

29:34.441 --> 29:35.900
Hey.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.110
Just grabbing some dinner?

29:37.110 --> 29:38.403
I am.

29:38.403 --> 29:40.780
Yeah.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.949
I was just admiring
this photo.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.826
Isn't it epic?

29:44.826 --> 29:46.578
Yeah.

29:46.578 --> 29:48.371
Yeah, sure is.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.332
She sure was.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.376
Was?

29:53.376 --> 29:55.670
Regan was her name.

29:55.670 --> 29:58.506
She was a legend
in these mountains.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.051
Died nine years ago.

30:01.843 --> 30:02.969
I'm so sorry.

30:02.969 --> 30:03.845
You knew her?

30:03.845 --> 30:06.389
Yeah.

30:06.389 --> 30:08.350
Quite well, in fact.

30:10.018 --> 30:11.311
Extra fries
and extra cheese.

30:11.311 --> 30:12.896
Just the way
the lady likes it.

30:12.896 --> 30:14.147
All right.

30:14.147 --> 30:15.065
Have a good night, man.

30:15.065 --> 30:16.733
Thank you. You too.

30:16.733 --> 30:18.610
Burgers and fries night
for my girl.

30:18.610 --> 30:19.694
I see.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.029
Have a good date.

30:24.074 --> 30:25.784
Your neck okay?

30:25.784 --> 30:27.243
Didn't you just...

30:27.243 --> 30:29.287
just have a massage,
or something?

30:29.287 --> 30:31.164
I did, yeah.

30:31.164 --> 30:33.500
But your date
went a little too deep,

30:33.500 --> 30:34.584
so to speak.

30:34.584 --> 30:36.169
My date?

30:36.169 --> 30:37.170
Sonya.

30:37.170 --> 30:38.963
Extra cheese and fries.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.131
The massage therapist.

30:41.716 --> 30:42.717
Yeah, right.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.346
Speaking of, do you know
where I could buy some Aspirin?

30:46.346 --> 30:47.347
You know what?

30:47.347 --> 30:48.515
I have some.

30:48.515 --> 30:49.683
Do you wanna...
wanna come with me?

30:51.559 --> 30:52.727
I got ya.

30:52.727 --> 30:54.062
My office is close by.

31:00.944 --> 31:02.362
Oh. So this is your office?

31:02.362 --> 31:03.530
Sure is.

31:07.075 --> 31:08.993
-"Canine saviour."
- Yeah.

31:08.993 --> 31:10.537
It's one of their avi dogs.

31:10.537 --> 31:12.539
They certainly do a good job
of saving lives for us.

31:13.665 --> 31:15.625
I can see that.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.211
Okay, take one tonight
and one tomorrow morning.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.630
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:20.630 --> 31:22.590
And you might wanna tell her

31:22.590 --> 31:24.968
that, uh, you just don't like
deep massages.

31:24.968 --> 31:26.803
Oh, trust me, I did.

31:27.804 --> 31:28.930
Oh.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.515
So I'll see you tomorrow?

31:30.515 --> 31:32.726
For some more computer
simulations and gaming?

31:32.726 --> 31:33.810
Can't wait.

31:33.810 --> 31:34.853
It's not gaming.

31:35.770 --> 31:36.980
Ish.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.940
It's forecasting
based on science,

31:38.940 --> 31:40.066
based on data,

31:40.066 --> 31:41.568
based on
proven algorithms.

31:41.568 --> 31:43.069
So I've been told.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.529
I don't get
why you're so against it.

31:44.529 --> 31:45.905
Against it?

31:45.905 --> 31:47.782
Science.

31:47.782 --> 31:49.576
No, I'm not against anything.

31:49.576 --> 31:50.910
But I do know

31:50.910 --> 31:52.370
that weather is a variable
that can't be predicted.

31:52.370 --> 31:54.581
It changes without notice.

31:54.581 --> 31:55.999
And science...

31:55.999 --> 31:58.168
well, science simply
can't predict that.

31:59.377 --> 32:00.337
Well, it's meant
to be a tool.

32:00.337 --> 32:02.130
A tool
that you incorporate.

32:02.839 --> 32:05.008
Hmm.

32:05.008 --> 32:07.344
Listen, I gotta go pick up
my daughter from music classes

32:07.344 --> 32:09.137
and get some food in her.

32:10.555 --> 32:12.098
Your daughter?

32:12.098 --> 32:14.267
I thought that food
was for your date, Sonya.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.935
Wow.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.395
That, my friend,
was a full-blown assumption.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.607
No, the only girlfriend
I have in my life

32:20.607 --> 32:21.858
is my daughter.

32:21.858 --> 32:23.318
Not that you were asking.

32:23.318 --> 32:24.903
I wasn't.

32:24.903 --> 32:26.488
Oh. Okay, good.

32:27.781 --> 32:29.157
Come on.

32:32.786 --> 32:33.870
Dad, come on!

32:33.870 --> 32:35.747
I mean, seriously,
it's Taylor Swift.

32:35.747 --> 32:37.040
She's an icon.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.541
Her new album--
you have to get me tickets.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.503
Okay. Well, when
do they go on sale again?

32:41.503 --> 32:43.129
And how much
is this gonna cost me?

32:43.129 --> 32:44.381
Feels expensive.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.552
- Hello!
- Hello?

32:51.638 --> 32:53.139
Sonya.

32:53.139 --> 32:54.974
I'm so sorry
to just barge in here like this,

32:54.974 --> 32:56.267
but I didn't know
who else to call.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.854
Dad, who's that?

32:59.854 --> 33:01.147
Hey, Samantha!
Do you remember me?

33:01.147 --> 33:03.149
We met earlier this year
at the salon

33:03.149 --> 33:04.401
when you were
getting your hair cut.

33:04.401 --> 33:05.694
Oh, right.

33:05.694 --> 33:07.862
Yeah, you were getting
some fake lashes put on,

33:07.862 --> 33:08.905
I think, right?

33:09.989 --> 33:11.658
Fake lashes?

33:11.658 --> 33:12.826
Kids these days.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.703
Uh, no, sweetheart,

33:14.703 --> 33:16.496
I was, um, getting

33:16.496 --> 33:19.332
a holistic hot-oil treatment
put on them.

33:23.003 --> 33:24.629
So, Sonya,
how can we help you?

33:24.629 --> 33:26.047
Oh, my heat's out

33:26.047 --> 33:28.633
and I can't get ahold
of my landlord, so...

33:28.633 --> 33:30.135
Oh, that's...

33:30.135 --> 33:31.344
that's terrible.

33:31.344 --> 33:33.138
Yeah. Anyhoo, I didn't know
who to call,

33:33.138 --> 33:34.723
as my sister's phone is off.

33:34.723 --> 33:37.017
And, obviously,
I can't sleep at home tonight.

33:37.017 --> 33:38.560
Did you call a friend?

33:38.560 --> 33:41.354
Which your dad is.

33:41.354 --> 33:43.732
My new friend, in fact,
who I like a lot.

33:45.233 --> 33:47.819
Anyways, I was hoping
maybe I could sleep over?

33:47.819 --> 33:49.320
Help me out of a jam?

33:53.408 --> 33:54.534
Well, what do you think, kiddo?

33:54.534 --> 33:56.077
I think
we should help Sonya out.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.663
I mean, she doesn't have
a place to stay.

33:58.663 --> 34:00.248
Okay.

34:00.248 --> 34:01.666
I'll go get some sheets
and a pillow for the couch.

34:01.666 --> 34:02.709
Great.

34:02.709 --> 34:03.918
Great, the couch.

34:06.629 --> 34:07.839
Nice place.

34:07.839 --> 34:08.798
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

34:08.798 --> 34:09.758
Yeah.

34:19.267 --> 34:20.435
You put lipstick on before bed?

34:20.435 --> 34:22.187
I've never seen that before.

34:22.187 --> 34:23.104
It's called "plumper".

34:23.104 --> 34:24.814
"Plumper"?

34:24.814 --> 34:26.608
Makes your lips look fuller.

34:26.608 --> 34:27.859
Oh.

34:27.859 --> 34:29.736
If you have flat lips,
you put it on, and...

34:29.736 --> 34:31.321
voilà.

34:31.321 --> 34:32.238
Here, let's try some on you.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.740
Um, is it a chemical?

34:34.866 --> 34:35.825
I don't know.

34:35.825 --> 34:37.243
And who cares?

34:37.243 --> 34:39.329
In the name of beauty,
let's do it all, am I right?

34:39.329 --> 34:41.247
Um, I think my lips
are okay, actually.

34:41.247 --> 34:42.332
I don't want it.

34:42.332 --> 34:44.876
I have an even better idea.

34:44.876 --> 34:46.419
Let's give you a full makeover.

34:46.419 --> 34:49.339
Go totally glam--
every girl's desire.

34:49.339 --> 34:51.049
Thanks, but no thanks.

34:51.049 --> 34:52.133
Oh, and the couch
is all made up.

34:52.133 --> 34:53.885
I see.

34:53.885 --> 34:55.428
Well, thank you.

34:55.428 --> 34:56.304
Okay.

34:56.304 --> 34:57.764
Good night, Sonya.

34:57.764 --> 34:58.932
'Night.

35:08.733 --> 35:10.110
Oh.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.778
Thank you for letting me stay.

35:13.113 --> 35:15.323
But are you sure that's
where you want me to sleep?

35:15.323 --> 35:17.492
Yeah, I'm sure.

35:17.492 --> 35:19.244
I'll see you in the morning.

35:19.244 --> 35:20.662
Glad we could help you out.

35:21.663 --> 35:22.831
Yeah.

35:27.502 --> 35:28.545
Great.

35:37.512 --> 35:38.972
Hey.

35:38.972 --> 35:41.016
What are you doing?

35:41.016 --> 35:42.726
Going to talk to my dad.

35:42.726 --> 35:45.311
I think he's had a long day
and maybe he's tired.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.063
Unless it's an emergency,

35:47.063 --> 35:48.606
I'd maybe say
now's not the best time.

35:51.109 --> 35:52.902
Do the dogs always sleep there?

35:52.902 --> 35:54.571
Yeah, they do.

35:54.571 --> 35:57.323
You can slide to the other side
of the couch if you want to.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.075
Okay. Go back to bed, sweetie.

35:59.075 --> 36:01.494
Please, please, please
let this be for only one night.

36:08.168 --> 36:09.878
Eww, you guys stink.

36:20.638 --> 36:22.932
The pitch is 37 degrees.

36:22.932 --> 36:24.100
Mm-hmm.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.352
And based on the data,

36:25.352 --> 36:26.519
the program predicts

36:26.519 --> 36:28.146
which area
is most likely to slide,

36:28.146 --> 36:29.564
which is outlined in red.

36:29.564 --> 36:32.317
The deeper the failure level,
the more dangerous.

36:32.317 --> 36:34.235
So, how deep is it here?

36:34.235 --> 36:36.446
Four feet.

36:36.446 --> 36:38.031
So we're talking about
a slab avalanche?

36:38.031 --> 36:39.324
Exactly.

36:39.324 --> 36:40.617
Okay.

36:40.617 --> 36:42.285
So, the starting zone
should be here.

36:42.285 --> 36:45.121
This is the track
and the runout.

36:45.121 --> 36:46.122
Let's see.

36:49.042 --> 36:50.502
Look at that.

36:50.502 --> 36:52.295
The program can predict
when an avalanche will happen

36:52.295 --> 36:53.463
with a high level of accuracy,

36:53.463 --> 36:54.714
and without manual testing,

36:54.714 --> 36:56.132
so we're not putting
anyone at risk.

36:56.132 --> 36:57.133
I'm all for that.

36:58.927 --> 36:59.928
Hey, Chris.

36:59.928 --> 37:01.262
Have you seen
how this works yet?

37:01.262 --> 37:03.473
It's incredible.
And accurate.

37:03.473 --> 37:05.767
Uh, I'll take a look
a little later.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.519
I'm just gonna head up
to rope off a couple areas.

37:09.062 --> 37:10.313
That's, uh, one job

37:10.313 --> 37:11.731
we're still gonna have to
perform ourselves,

37:11.731 --> 37:14.025
even with
Dr. Lawrence's forecasting.

37:15.026 --> 37:15.985
Touché.

37:15.985 --> 37:17.195
How's the neck?

37:18.279 --> 37:20.490
Better, thanks.

37:20.490 --> 37:21.616
Good to hear.

37:22.742 --> 37:24.494
I'll, uh,
see you a little later?

37:24.494 --> 37:25.870
Maybe you will.

37:32.377 --> 37:33.503
Let's look at
another example.

37:33.503 --> 37:34.796
Let's do that.

37:40.468 --> 37:42.053
Well, look who's here.

37:43.972 --> 37:45.932
All right, you wanna help me
close the area?

37:47.892 --> 37:49.269
Okay, are you gonna
help us too, buddy?

37:49.269 --> 37:50.520
What are you gonna do?

37:50.520 --> 37:52.272
We sure don't want
any skiers in this area

37:52.272 --> 37:54.024
with such a high risk
of avalanche.

37:59.946 --> 38:01.197
All right.

38:11.583 --> 38:13.126
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

38:13.126 --> 38:14.169
You can't come to Fernie

38:14.169 --> 38:15.295
without putting on
a pair of skis.

38:15.295 --> 38:16.588
Says who?

38:16.588 --> 38:17.756
It's gonna be fun.

38:17.756 --> 38:19.299
I'm exhausted already.

38:19.299 --> 38:21.718
Come on,
we'll do one lap around.

38:21.718 --> 38:23.511
If you're not feeling it,
we'll call it a day.

38:23.511 --> 38:25.013
- Promise?
- Promise.

38:25.013 --> 38:25.930
Now let's go!

38:31.061 --> 38:33.396
Heather, wait!

38:33.396 --> 38:35.231
Yeah, Riley.

38:35.231 --> 38:36.900
Look at you!

38:36.900 --> 38:38.234
Am I doing okay?

38:38.234 --> 38:39.986
You're doing great!

38:39.986 --> 38:42.197
Okay, we're coming up
on one full lap.

38:43.281 --> 38:44.491
What's the call?

38:44.491 --> 38:46.076
Uh, I don't know.

38:46.076 --> 38:47.869
What do you think?

38:47.869 --> 38:50.038
Well, cross-country skiing

38:50.038 --> 38:52.165
happens to be one of the best
aerobic sports there is.

38:52.165 --> 38:54.417
And it's great for the glutes.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.086
Is that true?

38:56.086 --> 38:58.463
Have you seen
a professional Nordic skier?

38:58.463 --> 39:01.257
Specimens of perfect health,
inside and out.

39:01.257 --> 39:03.176
Okay, let's do it.

39:03.176 --> 39:04.511
Okay.

39:04.511 --> 39:05.720
Thatta girl.

39:08.807 --> 39:10.684
Okay, Heather, I don't think
I can go much further.

39:10.684 --> 39:12.977
Okay, one more lap
and we'll go back in.

39:14.187 --> 39:15.397
Hey, ladies!

39:15.397 --> 39:17.816
Oh, hey, Sonya.

39:17.816 --> 39:19.317
I know you're an alpine skier,

39:19.317 --> 39:21.611
but you're clearly not much
of a cross-country skier.

39:21.611 --> 39:23.321
See if you can keep up!

39:29.953 --> 39:31.913
Don't worry about me, guys,
you just go ahead.

39:41.339 --> 39:42.924
Am I getting
snow in your face?

39:44.009 --> 39:46.011
Yeah, Heather!

39:46.011 --> 39:47.303
Yeah! Go, sister!

39:47.303 --> 39:49.472
What's the matter,
Alpine Princess,

39:49.472 --> 39:50.807
you can't keep up?

39:58.189 --> 39:59.149
Let's see what you got.

40:04.696 --> 40:05.780
Come on, push!

40:05.780 --> 40:07.032
Don't let her beat ya.

40:09.075 --> 40:10.118
Come on, Heather!

40:10.118 --> 40:11.619
Come on!

40:11.619 --> 40:12.662
Almost there.

40:12.662 --> 40:14.497
Push! Push! Push!

40:14.497 --> 40:16.166
Ooh...

40:16.166 --> 40:17.792
looks like I'm the winner!

40:22.797 --> 40:23.882
Did that really just happen?

40:25.133 --> 40:26.509
Fire alarms.

40:26.509 --> 40:27.969
You'd be putting off
fire alarms.

40:29.387 --> 40:30.597
Well, I'm definitely

40:30.597 --> 40:32.349
not a professional
cross-country skier.

40:34.017 --> 40:35.226
Hey, I'm really glad
we did this today, sis.

40:35.226 --> 40:36.186
It was fun.

40:36.186 --> 40:37.187
Really?

40:37.187 --> 40:38.688
Yeah.

40:38.688 --> 40:39.856
Even though she smoked ya.

40:41.941 --> 40:43.068
She did.

40:43.068 --> 40:44.361
She really did.

40:53.495 --> 40:56.081
Oh, I could really go
for a donut right now.

40:57.082 --> 40:58.458
Have you ever had
a beaver tail?

40:58.458 --> 40:59.793
Eww. What's a beaver tail?

40:59.793 --> 41:01.461
Oh, they're so good.

41:01.461 --> 41:02.754
Thank you.

41:02.754 --> 41:04.297
It's kind of like
a funnel cake,

41:04.297 --> 41:05.423
but a different shape.

41:05.423 --> 41:06.675
Hmm.

41:06.675 --> 41:08.134
This is happening tomorrow.

41:08.134 --> 41:09.386
Oh.

41:09.386 --> 41:10.553
Well, if Chris is teaching,
you have to go.

41:10.553 --> 41:12.263
I might.

41:12.263 --> 41:14.724
It'd be nice to see him
in action again, you know?

41:14.724 --> 41:16.142
Get a feel for his technique.

41:16.142 --> 41:17.268
I bet you would.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.813
You're terrible.

41:23.566 --> 41:24.859
Now, I'm assuming

41:24.859 --> 41:26.111
one of the reasons
you're here today

41:26.111 --> 41:28.196
is because you're all
backcountry enthusiasts.

41:28.196 --> 41:30.740
But maybe each of you

41:30.740 --> 41:33.076
signed up
for a personal reason, too.

41:33.076 --> 41:35.286
And if you did,
I wanna hear it.

41:35.286 --> 41:36.204
If you're willing to share.

41:36.204 --> 41:38.164
Anybody?

41:38.164 --> 41:39.249
Yeah, I'll go first.

41:39.249 --> 41:40.208
All right.

41:40.208 --> 41:41.376
Uh, well,
I didn't grow up skiing,

41:41.376 --> 41:42.961
or, you know,
out here in the mountains.

41:42.961 --> 41:44.421
So, now that I'm out here,

41:44.421 --> 41:45.755
I feel like I need to gain

41:45.755 --> 41:47.382
some more knowledge
and some more experience.

41:47.382 --> 41:48.258
So, that's why I'm here.

41:48.258 --> 41:49.801
Thank you.

41:50.969 --> 41:52.178
Yeah. I have two daughters

41:52.178 --> 41:54.264
that were involved
in an avalanche last year.

41:54.264 --> 41:56.349
My youngest had to dig out
her older sister,

41:56.349 --> 41:58.184
who was buried up to her neck.

41:58.184 --> 41:59.519
Turned out okay.

41:59.519 --> 42:00.937
So I'm taking this course,

42:00.937 --> 42:02.647
because I don't have
that knowledge,

42:02.647 --> 42:04.065
and I wanna go skiing with them
as a family.

42:04.983 --> 42:06.276
Thank you. Thank you.

42:06.276 --> 42:07.485
Well, last season,

42:07.485 --> 42:09.612
I broke both my ankles
in the Pyramid gap.

42:09.612 --> 42:11.031
Luckily, my friends were there,

42:11.031 --> 42:13.033
and they got me out of there
safe and fast.

42:13.033 --> 42:14.784
I'm looking to do this course,

42:14.784 --> 42:16.036
because I wanna be there
for them

42:16.036 --> 42:17.328
if the roles ever change.

42:17.328 --> 42:18.705
Wow.

42:18.705 --> 42:19.748
Thanks for sharing.

42:19.748 --> 42:21.249
All really good reasons.

42:21.249 --> 42:22.792
And yourself?

42:22.792 --> 42:24.294
What brings you here
this morning?

42:24.294 --> 42:26.796
Curiosity, I suppose.

42:26.796 --> 42:29.132
All right, then.

42:29.132 --> 42:31.509
Well, I appreciate
you all sharing.

42:31.509 --> 42:33.928
What I hope to instill
in you today

42:33.928 --> 42:36.639
is a healthy fear of avalanches.

42:36.639 --> 42:37.974
But, more than that,

42:37.974 --> 42:39.684
I want you to leave this course

42:39.684 --> 42:41.102
with a confidence

42:41.102 --> 42:43.897
in your ability to make
the right decisions.

42:43.897 --> 42:48.234
Now, these decisions
are not always the most popular,

42:48.234 --> 42:51.696
or that your fellow skiers
or boarders wanna make,

42:51.696 --> 42:54.449
but it's those tough decisions
that save lives.

42:54.449 --> 42:55.867
All right, everyone ready?

42:55.867 --> 42:56.951
- Yeah?
- You bet.

42:56.951 --> 42:57.994
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

43:00.747 --> 43:02.040
Come here.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.166
Hey, what's your deal?

43:03.166 --> 43:04.376
My deal?

43:04.376 --> 43:05.502
Yeah. I just wanna make sure

43:05.502 --> 43:06.670
you're here
for all the right reasons.

43:06.670 --> 43:08.421
Wrong reasons being?

43:08.421 --> 43:10.256
Being critiquing my work.

43:10.256 --> 43:11.549
I'm not into that.

43:11.549 --> 43:12.676
I would never!

43:12.676 --> 43:14.010
I'm here to learn from you.

43:14.010 --> 43:16.429
Well, I hope you're not
a disruptive student!

43:16.429 --> 43:17.847
I'll be on my best behavior.

43:17.847 --> 43:19.474
I promise.

43:19.474 --> 43:20.809
I hope so.

43:20.809 --> 43:21.976
All right, guys, let's go!

43:23.144 --> 43:24.396
Follow me.

43:44.749 --> 43:46.376
Everybody in?

43:47.794 --> 43:49.879
Oh, Mogul.

43:49.879 --> 43:51.673
Good boy. Good boy!

44:20.869 --> 44:22.245
Now, somewhere on this slope,

44:22.245 --> 44:24.122
I've buried a backpack
with a transceiver inside it

44:24.122 --> 44:25.999
to simulate an avalanche victim.

44:25.999 --> 44:28.752
All right, now, just pretend
this is your friend.

44:28.752 --> 44:30.337
Let's call him Steve.

44:30.337 --> 44:31.254
Okay?

44:31.254 --> 44:32.297
Now, when I yell "avalanche,"

44:32.297 --> 44:35.759
I want you
to grab your transceiver,

44:35.759 --> 44:38.636
and switch it from "send"
to "search".

44:41.014 --> 44:42.932
Okay? Everyone got that?

44:42.932 --> 44:45.060
And you're gonna
grab your probe,

44:45.060 --> 44:47.020
and then you're gonna go
search for Steve.

44:47.020 --> 44:50.023
Now, as your transceiver
beeps louder and louder,

44:50.023 --> 44:52.400
that means
you're getting closer to Steve.

44:52.400 --> 44:57.572
And when your probe
hits something squishy in there,

44:57.572 --> 44:58.865
you got Steve.

44:58.865 --> 45:00.241
Everyone got it?

45:00.241 --> 45:01.576
Everyone, just start
spreading out a little bit.

45:02.660 --> 45:03.703
Very good. Very good.

45:03.703 --> 45:05.663
Okay, and...

45:05.663 --> 45:07.207
Avalanche!

45:09.084 --> 45:11.419
That's it!
Good, good, good.

45:11.419 --> 45:12.587
Okay, on average,

45:12.587 --> 45:13.797
an avalanche victim

45:13.797 --> 45:15.298
will be buried
under four feet of snow,

45:15.298 --> 45:17.717
so make sure you just stick
that probe deep.

45:17.717 --> 45:19.094
After ten minutes,

45:19.094 --> 45:20.845
a skier
that's buried under the snow--

45:20.845 --> 45:23.932
their chance of survival
decreases by 80%.

45:23.932 --> 45:25.809
So, keep going.
Keep going.

45:25.809 --> 45:27.102
Just another foot or so!

45:27.102 --> 45:28.228
That's it.

45:30.939 --> 45:31.898
I think I've got him!

45:31.898 --> 45:33.149
I think I found Steve!

45:33.149 --> 45:34.567
All right,
keep digging, keep digging!

45:35.694 --> 45:36.695
Time to dig!

45:42.409 --> 45:43.910
Oh, thank goodness,
we found Steve!

45:43.910 --> 45:45.203
Oh, excellent.

45:45.203 --> 45:47.080
Yeah! Really well done,
everybody!

45:47.080 --> 45:48.081
All right!

45:48.081 --> 45:49.124
Well done.

45:49.124 --> 45:52.377
Ha, ha! Fantastic.

45:52.377 --> 45:53.503
All right, everyone, gather in.

45:57.924 --> 45:59.134
All right, listen up.

45:59.134 --> 46:00.927
Megan's gonna teach us
about the snowpack.

46:00.927 --> 46:02.095
So, today, we're gonna learn

46:02.095 --> 46:04.305
how to find weak layers
in the snow.

46:04.305 --> 46:05.557
What we're really
trying to find,

46:05.557 --> 46:08.351
if we have softer snow
on top of firm snow,

46:08.351 --> 46:09.686
which would cause an avalanche.

46:09.686 --> 46:11.021
So we're gonna do that

46:11.021 --> 46:12.939
by checking out
the resistance of the snowpack

46:12.939 --> 46:14.691
by using our-- our hands

46:14.691 --> 46:16.109
and poking into the snow.

46:16.109 --> 46:17.861
You can also come on in
and use the popsicle sticks.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.281
Okay. Everyone--
Come on in, everybody.

46:21.281 --> 46:23.199
You guys can use these
popsicle sticks over there.

46:23.199 --> 46:24.159
Do you wanna go over there?

46:24.159 --> 46:27.620
Okay, so, here...

46:27.620 --> 46:29.706
let me just smooth
this surface out for you.

46:29.706 --> 46:31.583
What do you think? Solid?

46:31.583 --> 46:32.417
Or is that soft?

46:32.417 --> 46:33.543
It feels soft right there.

46:33.543 --> 46:34.711
That's true.

46:34.711 --> 46:35.754
Okay, how about down here,
in this layer?

46:37.088 --> 46:38.965
That's a little...

46:38.965 --> 46:39.883
That's a little tougher.

46:39.883 --> 46:41.176
Mm-hmm.

46:41.176 --> 46:42.135
Learning anything there, scientist?

46:42.135 --> 46:43.386
Okay, let's try this out here.

46:44.846 --> 46:45.930
All right...

46:45.930 --> 46:47.682
♪ Two kids, one crush ♪

46:47.682 --> 46:50.643
♪ Before we knew it
we were deep in love ♪

46:50.643 --> 46:54.356
♪ Wheels turning
as we pick up speed... ♪

46:56.566 --> 46:58.485
So, what'd you think
of the course?

46:58.485 --> 46:59.569
Honestly?

47:01.196 --> 47:02.197
I thought it was great.

47:02.197 --> 47:04.324
No constructive criticism?

47:04.324 --> 47:05.658
Mm...

47:05.658 --> 47:06.701
maybe one thing.

47:07.994 --> 47:08.995
Okay. Let's hear it.

47:08.995 --> 47:10.497
I think you should be willing

47:10.497 --> 47:12.332
to incorporate
my forecasting program.

47:12.332 --> 47:13.708
Like, you know how I feel.

47:14.918 --> 47:16.169
Explain that to me again.

47:16.169 --> 47:17.587
Like, I just don't need

47:17.587 --> 47:18.880
a scientist coming here
to tell me how things work.

47:19.964 --> 47:22.008
I know.

47:22.008 --> 47:23.927
- You know?
- Yeah.

47:23.927 --> 47:25.011
- With certainty?
- That's right.

47:25.011 --> 47:26.346
And you never get it wrong?

47:26.346 --> 47:27.389
Nope.

47:29.724 --> 47:32.644
Well, I guess there's
no arguing with perfection.

47:32.644 --> 47:33.853
Exactly.

47:37.232 --> 47:38.441
You know what?

47:38.441 --> 47:39.984
I gotta pick up Samantha soon.

47:39.984 --> 47:40.902
It's the first day
of ski school.

47:43.363 --> 47:44.948
Wanna join me for a few runs?

47:46.700 --> 47:48.576
Sure.

47:48.576 --> 47:49.619
All right.

47:49.619 --> 47:50.745
Let's go get Mogul.

47:51.913 --> 47:53.373
Mogul skis?

47:53.373 --> 47:55.417
Has he always
ridden the lift with you?

47:55.417 --> 47:56.793
Oh, yeah.

47:56.793 --> 47:58.628
Ever since he was a little pup.
Right, buddy?

47:58.628 --> 48:00.505
Aww.

48:03.091 --> 48:04.592
Yeah, it doesn't get
any better than this.

48:05.719 --> 48:06.928
Nope.

48:10.390 --> 48:12.100
What are you looking for?

48:12.100 --> 48:13.810
Your girlfriend.

48:13.810 --> 48:15.687
My girlfriend?

48:15.687 --> 48:17.689
Sonya.

48:17.689 --> 48:19.733
Sonya?

48:19.733 --> 48:21.234
It's kind of weird.

48:21.234 --> 48:23.778
Well, she's not weird, but...

48:23.778 --> 48:25.572
she randomly challenged me
to a race yesterday

48:25.572 --> 48:28.033
when I was cross-country skiing
with my sister.

48:28.033 --> 48:30.326
So, I don't think
she'd be too keen on us,

48:30.326 --> 48:32.662
you know, hanging out.

48:33.830 --> 48:35.290
Oh.

48:35.290 --> 48:37.917
Well, okay, firstly,
Sonya's not my girlfriend.

48:37.917 --> 48:39.419
And secondly,

48:39.419 --> 48:42.339
aside from the one dinner date
we had over a month ago,

48:42.339 --> 48:44.257
I have given her no indication

48:44.257 --> 48:46.301
that she's anything
other than just a friend.

48:47.260 --> 48:48.803
Just not into her.

48:51.389 --> 48:52.724
Good to know.

48:52.724 --> 48:54.267
Yeah.

48:54.267 --> 48:55.810
Glad we cleared that up.
Right, buddy?

49:32.013 --> 49:34.057
Hey, was that
a fun run, or what?

49:34.057 --> 49:35.308
It was.

49:35.308 --> 49:36.768
Yeah? What was
your favorite part?

49:36.768 --> 49:38.186
Turns.

49:38.186 --> 49:39.437
Yeah? How about you guys?
What was your favorite part?

49:39.437 --> 49:41.773
Um, jumps. Yeah.
That was really fun.

49:41.773 --> 49:42.857
Good stuff.

49:45.777 --> 49:46.653
Hey, kiddo!

49:46.653 --> 49:48.363
Hi, Dad!

49:48.363 --> 49:49.906
Do you remember Heather
from the demonstration?

49:49.906 --> 49:52.158
Of course, I do.
Do you ski?

49:52.158 --> 49:53.284
Almost better than your dad.

49:53.284 --> 49:54.369
Uh-oh, looks like you have

49:54.369 --> 49:55.453
some competition
on the hill today.

49:55.453 --> 49:56.871
Oh yeah, seems like I do.

49:58.039 --> 49:59.082
Thanks a lot, Ange.

49:59.082 --> 50:00.542
No problem.
She's good to go.

50:00.542 --> 50:01.376
- All right.
- Bye, guys.

50:01.376 --> 50:02.460
- Bye.
- Bye.

50:02.460 --> 50:03.503
So, good class?

50:03.503 --> 50:05.255
Yeah, snow was awesome!

50:05.255 --> 50:07.507
Did you and my dad
ski together today?

50:07.507 --> 50:09.634
Not all day,
but we got a few runs in.

50:09.634 --> 50:11.094
That's good.

50:11.094 --> 50:13.054
Hey, Heather, wanna go and see
the Mountain Rescue pups?

50:13.054 --> 50:14.055
They're really learning a lot.

50:14.055 --> 50:15.807
I'd love to.

50:15.807 --> 50:17.100
Okay. Last one
to the bottom of the hill

50:17.100 --> 50:18.059
owes me a foot massage.

50:20.061 --> 50:21.521
A foot massage?

50:21.521 --> 50:22.897
Yeah.

50:22.897 --> 50:24.441
Welcome to my single-parent
fathering world

50:24.441 --> 50:25.900
of raising a mountain girl.

50:27.110 --> 50:28.278
- Shall we?
- Sounds good.

50:28.278 --> 50:29.654
All right.

50:41.875 --> 50:43.585
Could these puppies
be any cuter?

50:43.585 --> 50:45.628
So my dad was telling me
you're a scientist?

50:45.628 --> 50:47.297
I am.

50:47.297 --> 50:48.631
Studying patterns of the snow,

50:48.631 --> 50:50.258
and predicting avalanches
before they might happen,

50:50.258 --> 50:51.634
and stuff?

50:51.634 --> 50:53.928
Sounds like you study
some of this yourself.

50:53.928 --> 50:55.180
Not really, but kinda.

50:55.180 --> 50:56.473
My mom was kinda into it.

50:56.473 --> 50:57.766
Or so I've been told.

50:58.850 --> 51:00.101
Is she still?

51:00.101 --> 51:01.478
Into it, I mean?

51:01.478 --> 51:03.646
No, my mom passed away
when I was two years old.

51:05.273 --> 51:07.150
I'm so sorry to hear that.

51:07.150 --> 51:08.068
That's her, actually.

51:08.068 --> 51:09.527
Over there, on the wall.

51:12.197 --> 51:13.573
Regan was your mom?

51:14.699 --> 51:16.659
- You know her name?
- Yeah. I, um...

51:16.659 --> 51:18.495
I was admiring
her photo the other night,

51:18.495 --> 51:20.580
and your dad, he, uh...

51:20.580 --> 51:22.082
mentioned her name.

51:22.082 --> 51:23.792
But I-- I didn't know
that was your mom.

51:25.543 --> 51:26.544
Oh, hi, guys.

51:27.545 --> 51:28.963
Get 'em while they're hot.

51:28.963 --> 51:30.882
They give extra whip
here at the lodge.

51:30.882 --> 51:32.175
This right here

51:32.175 --> 51:33.968
is the best hot chocolate
in the world, Heather.

51:33.968 --> 51:35.261
There you go.

51:35.261 --> 51:36.680
In the world.

51:40.058 --> 51:41.518
Wow!

51:41.518 --> 51:43.061
It's really good.

51:43.061 --> 51:44.562
Uh, you just got a little...

51:45.772 --> 51:46.690
Oh! Oh.

51:47.649 --> 51:48.733
So, did you ask her?

51:48.733 --> 51:50.318
Ask me?

51:50.318 --> 51:51.695
My dad has
something to ask you.

51:51.695 --> 51:53.905
Easy, kiddo,
just give a guy a minute, okay?

51:55.865 --> 51:57.992
Um, I'm not sure
if you've heard,

51:57.992 --> 51:59.911
but the Mountain Rescue
fundraiser is coming up.

52:00.912 --> 52:02.247
Tonight.
The fundraiser is tonight.

52:02.247 --> 52:03.915
Tonight.

52:03.915 --> 52:05.125
Eric mentioned
something about that.

52:05.125 --> 52:06.835
It's here at the lodge,
I think I read.

52:06.835 --> 52:07.711
Wanna come?

52:09.087 --> 52:10.046
Well, um...

52:10.046 --> 52:11.297
I, uh...

52:11.297 --> 52:12.716
There's gonna be
singing and dancing--

52:12.716 --> 52:14.634
although don't expect
any Taylor Swift covers,

52:14.634 --> 52:15.969
I already asked.

52:15.969 --> 52:18.388
Mm. Bummer.

52:18.388 --> 52:19.931
And we have an extra ticket.

52:19.931 --> 52:22.058
Which he got today,
hoping maybe you'd wanna come.

52:23.435 --> 52:24.853
You got me a ticket?

52:25.937 --> 52:26.896
He did.

52:26.896 --> 52:27.897
Well, I didn't--

52:27.897 --> 52:29.524
I didn't actually get a ticket.

52:29.524 --> 52:30.984
Um, there was just one left,

52:30.984 --> 52:32.402
and, uh, I didn't
see your name on the list.

52:32.402 --> 52:34.070
So...

52:34.070 --> 52:35.405
So, he got it for you.

52:35.405 --> 52:36.740
Wanna come?

52:36.740 --> 52:38.116
Sure.

52:38.116 --> 52:39.117
I'd love to.

52:41.953 --> 52:42.954
Okay.

52:45.498 --> 52:46.416
Are you sure?

52:46.416 --> 52:47.751
Absolutely.

52:47.751 --> 52:49.669
I want you to have
this night with Chris.

52:49.669 --> 52:51.629
I just-- I have a feeling
about you two.

52:52.756 --> 52:54.257
We're just colleagues.

52:54.257 --> 52:57.761
I'll admit, he's really cute,

52:57.761 --> 53:00.597
but I'm not into
how he dismisses the work I do.

53:00.597 --> 53:01.931
It's insulting.

53:01.931 --> 53:04.309
Have you asked him
why he's being so dismissive?

53:05.393 --> 53:06.603
I have.

53:06.603 --> 53:08.271
And he's yet
to give me a real answer.

53:08.271 --> 53:09.647
Hmm.

53:09.647 --> 53:11.024
Well, maybe tonight

53:11.024 --> 53:12.233
is the night
you finally get through to him.

53:12.233 --> 53:14.027
And, besides,
it's gonna be a lot of fun!

53:14.027 --> 53:15.570
And you're sure you're okay
with staying here?

53:15.570 --> 53:17.238
Are you kidding me?

53:17.238 --> 53:18.323
A fire.

53:18.323 --> 53:19.491
A hot bath.
Movie in bed.

53:19.491 --> 53:21.076
That's my dream.

53:21.076 --> 53:22.994
When are you supposed to take
that next pregnancy test?

53:23.995 --> 53:26.414
I'm supposed
to take it tonight.

53:26.414 --> 53:27.791
I'm not quite ready.

53:27.791 --> 53:29.876
Well, no matter how that goes,
I'm here for you.

53:29.876 --> 53:32.253
Thank you. Now, go.
Go get ready.

53:32.253 --> 53:34.172
I have nothing to wear!

53:37.342 --> 53:38.927
Guess I'll just have to
go through your suitcase.

53:40.261 --> 53:41.596
Just not my black boots.

Well, I do what I can do.

54:08.790 --> 54:10.291
Great turnout.

54:10.291 --> 54:11.960
Yeah, it's such a relief.

54:11.960 --> 54:13.962
I always get so nervous
before these things.

54:13.962 --> 54:15.213
Looks like a lot of people

54:15.213 --> 54:17.382
understand the importance
of Mountain Rescue.

54:17.382 --> 54:19.384
There she is!

54:19.384 --> 54:21.469
Bridget!

54:21.469 --> 54:22.887
Oh, I was hoping
I would see you.

54:24.055 --> 54:25.348
I hear from Eric

54:25.348 --> 54:26.808
you are breaking some ground
with your research.

54:26.808 --> 54:28.393
We have. We are.
It's very exciting.

54:29.602 --> 54:31.229
Well, just wanted
to pop over, say hi.

54:31.229 --> 54:32.355
It's so good to see you.

54:32.355 --> 54:33.690
We are almost ready.

54:33.690 --> 54:35.608
Yes. Um, I need to steal
Chris for a minute,

54:35.608 --> 54:36.317
and I promise
I'll bring him right back.

54:36.317 --> 54:37.318
Of course.

54:37.318 --> 54:38.361
Good luck.

54:38.361 --> 54:39.112
Thank you.

54:41.740 --> 54:42.907
Yeah, that sounds good. Okay.

54:44.075 --> 54:45.410
Heather!

54:45.410 --> 54:46.953
Here, I got you
a root-beer float.

54:46.953 --> 54:48.413
You seem to like whipped cream,

54:48.413 --> 54:49.539
and they were making it fresh.

54:49.539 --> 54:51.374
Ooh, a girl
who knows her drinks.

54:52.917 --> 54:53.877
Mm!

54:53.877 --> 54:55.170
Right?

54:55.170 --> 54:57.547
Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

54:57.547 --> 54:59.007
You know, just about everybody

54:59.007 --> 55:00.925
who's been rescued
in the backcountry

55:00.925 --> 55:03.428
has something similar to say.

55:03.428 --> 55:08.016
The experience made them realize
just how fragile life is.

55:08.016 --> 55:10.602
They wanna do something
good in the world,

55:10.602 --> 55:12.437
help people out.

55:12.437 --> 55:16.649
It's the kind of thing
we need more of in this world,

55:16.649 --> 55:20.236
and that's exactly
what makes us do what we do.

55:26.659 --> 55:27.911
Now, every year,

55:27.911 --> 55:30.914
we have more people
coming into the park.

55:30.914 --> 55:32.582
And with more visitors...

55:32.582 --> 55:34.250
well, comes more accidents.

55:34.250 --> 55:36.461
People don't realize
how dangerous it is.

55:36.461 --> 55:37.629
There is no safe backcountry.

55:37.629 --> 55:38.755
There is always a risk.

55:38.755 --> 55:40.590
We can't stop them from coming,

55:40.590 --> 55:42.050
but we can help educate them
on the risks

55:42.050 --> 55:44.094
and be here in the event
something bad happens.

55:44.094 --> 55:46.596
This leads to a greater need
for mountain personnel,

55:46.596 --> 55:48.264
rescue dogs, and equipment.

55:48.264 --> 55:49.557
So, this year,

55:49.557 --> 55:51.726
we're kicking off
our fundraising campaign

55:51.726 --> 55:53.937
for the renovation and expansion

55:53.937 --> 55:56.147
of our Mountain Rescue headquarters.

56:03.321 --> 56:07.283
And anyone who donates
$500 or more tonight

56:07.283 --> 56:10.161
gets a guided hike
to the famous Grinnell Glacier.

56:11.496 --> 56:13.081
And, I should add,

56:13.081 --> 56:17.293
it's most safely accessed
by a Mountain Rescue escort.

56:23.675 --> 56:24.592
Five hundred!

56:24.592 --> 56:26.094
Wow!

56:26.094 --> 56:28.054
- Perfect.
- One thousand!

56:28.054 --> 56:29.556
Thank you!

56:29.556 --> 56:31.975
Two thousand!
Two-thousand dollars!

56:31.975 --> 56:34.144
Wow! That's very generous,
thank you very much.

56:34.144 --> 56:35.270
Five thousand!

56:35.270 --> 56:36.312
Five-thousand dollars!

56:36.312 --> 56:37.355
Fantastic.

56:38.398 --> 56:39.566
Thank you very much.

56:39.566 --> 56:40.900
Very generous of you.
Very generous

56:42.193 --> 56:44.112
Okay, time
for the fun to begin!

56:44.112 --> 56:45.947
So, everyone,
grab yourself a drink,

56:45.947 --> 56:47.532
and enjoy the sweet sound

56:47.532 --> 56:50.076
from the beautiful,
talented Melvin.

57:01.671 --> 57:03.340
You know, Mountain Rescue's

57:03.340 --> 57:05.175
really lucky to have someone
like your dad.

57:05.175 --> 57:06.217
Yeah.

57:06.217 --> 57:08.345
They're lucky
to have you, too.

57:08.345 --> 57:09.846
You're really good
with those puppies.

57:09.846 --> 57:11.514
Where'd you learn
how to train them so well?

57:11.514 --> 57:12.932
Videos my mom made.

57:12.932 --> 57:14.351
She made
these instructional videos

57:14.351 --> 57:15.727
for each pup she trained.

57:15.727 --> 57:17.145
She was really good at it.

57:17.145 --> 57:18.563
And when I turned six,
I found them,

57:18.563 --> 57:21.024
and I started
following her lead.

57:21.024 --> 57:23.193
And my dad thought
I should take over.

57:23.193 --> 57:26.071
Well, I can guarantee you,
she's incredibly proud of you.

57:26.071 --> 57:27.697
Thanks.

57:27.697 --> 57:28.782
You actually
remind me of her...

57:28.782 --> 57:30.825
from the stories
I've heard about her.

57:30.825 --> 57:32.410
Is that so?

57:32.410 --> 57:33.953
Well, you're a mountain girl,
like she was,

57:33.953 --> 57:35.663
and you wanna help people,
like she did.

57:35.663 --> 57:38.249
Exactly the type of person
I wanna be when I grow up.

57:40.126 --> 57:43.463
Samantha, I can guarantee you,

57:43.463 --> 57:45.340
you're already halfway there,

57:45.340 --> 57:46.299
if not there already.

57:58.436 --> 57:59.562
Care to dance?

57:59.562 --> 58:00.939
I'm okay,
but I think Heather does.

58:02.065 --> 58:03.441
Come on, you know you want to.

58:04.651 --> 58:06.236
Heather?

58:06.236 --> 58:07.278
I thought you'd never ask.

58:10.281 --> 58:11.282
Thanks.

Remember that night
I needed to talk to my dad

59:19.976 --> 59:21.811
and you said,
"Now is not the best time"?

59:21.811 --> 59:23.271
I do.

1:00:10.193 --> 1:00:12.487
the Mountain Rescue team and I

1:00:12.487 --> 1:00:15.949
have purchased a gift
for two very special people--

1:00:15.949 --> 1:00:18.410
our director, Chris Parker,

1:00:18.410 --> 1:00:22.622
and his amazing daughter
and avi pup trainer, Samantha.

1:00:22.622 --> 1:00:24.791
We got them
this amazing gourmet basket

1:00:24.791 --> 1:00:26.334
with goodies galore.

1:00:26.334 --> 1:00:28.086
So, Chris and Samantha,
please come on up here.

1:00:28.086 --> 1:00:29.045
Come on, let's go.

1:00:31.381 --> 1:00:32.757
Whoo!

1:00:51.901 --> 1:00:53.361
You've been quiet this morning.

1:00:53.361 --> 1:00:54.988
What are you thinking about?

1:00:54.988 --> 1:00:56.281
Well, you know
when you always say

1:00:56.281 --> 1:00:57.615
that sometimes people
come into your life

1:00:57.615 --> 1:00:59.034
for a reason?

1:00:59.034 --> 1:01:00.618
I do.

1:01:00.618 --> 1:01:01.828
Well, dogs.

1:01:01.828 --> 1:01:04.122
But can it apply
to people, too?

1:01:04.122 --> 1:01:05.582
I don't see why not.

1:01:06.875 --> 1:01:08.418
What's making you
think about it?

1:01:08.418 --> 1:01:10.337
- I was just wondering.
- Hmm.

1:01:12.630 --> 1:01:15.467
Hey, what do you say

1:01:15.467 --> 1:01:18.345
you and I make use
of that gift basket,

1:01:18.345 --> 1:01:20.263
and take the ski-doo
up the mountain

1:01:20.263 --> 1:01:22.599
to our special spot
and indulge?

1:01:22.599 --> 1:01:23.892
Hmm?

1:01:23.892 --> 1:01:25.226
I have an even better idea.

1:01:32.942 --> 1:01:34.986
Okay, here I am.

1:01:36.488 --> 1:01:37.697
Dressed for adventure,
like you said.

1:01:37.697 --> 1:01:38.698
Mm-hmm.

1:01:38.698 --> 1:01:40.158
Helmet.

1:01:40.158 --> 1:01:41.701
Where are we going?

1:01:41.701 --> 1:01:43.870
It's a surprise.

1:01:43.870 --> 1:01:45.205
You sound like your daughter.

1:01:45.205 --> 1:01:47.540
Whose idea this actually was.

1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:48.875
Really?

1:01:48.875 --> 1:01:50.543
She insisted
we go on this date.

1:01:50.543 --> 1:01:51.920
This is a date?

1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:54.214
It is.

1:01:54.214 --> 1:01:56.049
You made an impression.

1:01:56.049 --> 1:01:58.385
Samantha likes you a lot.

1:01:59.928 --> 1:02:01.513
Probably 'cause you guys
have the same taste in music.

1:02:01.513 --> 1:02:02.430
Ah.

1:02:02.430 --> 1:02:04.933
And because I like you, too.

1:02:06.101 --> 1:02:07.769
A lot.

1:02:09.688 --> 1:02:10.980
Come on, get on.

1:03:14.044 --> 1:03:15.253
Yeah...

1:03:15.253 --> 1:03:16.838
for a picnic.

1:03:18.340 --> 1:03:19.758
Again, Samantha insisted
I bring it.

1:03:19.758 --> 1:03:21.634
Oh...

1:03:21.634 --> 1:03:23.261
that was nice.

1:03:23.261 --> 1:03:24.721
All right, follow me.

1:03:31.853 --> 1:03:32.896
Ta-dah!

1:03:32.896 --> 1:03:34.939
Wow!

1:03:40.487 --> 1:03:41.571
Do you remember
your first rescue?

1:03:43.990 --> 1:03:45.158
Yeah.

1:03:45.158 --> 1:03:46.242
Yeah, I do.

1:03:46.242 --> 1:03:47.494
I'll never forget it, actually.

1:03:47.494 --> 1:03:49.496
Can you tell me about it?

1:03:50.705 --> 1:03:52.040
Sure.

1:03:52.040 --> 1:03:54.125
Um...

1:03:54.125 --> 1:03:56.711
Well, I was in training,
here in Fernie.

1:03:57.754 --> 1:03:59.756
My first year,
right out of college.

1:04:01.257 --> 1:04:04.052
These, uh, high-school kids
were looking for fresh tracks,

1:04:04.052 --> 1:04:06.638
and they ducked the rope.

1:04:06.638 --> 1:04:09.099
You know, sometimes,
these local kids, they, uh...

1:04:09.099 --> 1:04:10.600
I don't know,

1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:12.227
they just get
too cocky up there.

1:04:12.227 --> 1:04:13.687
You know?

1:04:13.687 --> 1:04:16.898
Anyway, there was
this tree buried in the snow,

1:04:16.898 --> 1:04:19.526
and both of these kids
skied right into it.

1:04:19.526 --> 1:04:21.861
One of them
broke his leg, and...

1:04:21.861 --> 1:04:23.947
and the other
just blew out his knee.

1:04:23.947 --> 1:04:25.407
Gosh.

1:04:25.407 --> 1:04:27.784
Yeah. If I hadn't seen
their tracks on my last sweep,

1:04:27.784 --> 1:04:29.369
they would've been caught
out there overnight,

1:04:29.369 --> 1:04:31.121
and they wouldn't have made it.

1:04:32.247 --> 1:04:34.374
They got lucky.

1:04:34.374 --> 1:04:35.834
Have you ever seen
those boys again?

1:04:35.834 --> 1:04:37.210
Yeah.

1:04:37.210 --> 1:04:38.670
They're all grown-up now.

1:04:38.670 --> 1:04:40.213
One of them's
a firefighter in Fernie,

1:04:40.213 --> 1:04:42.465
and the other one works
for Mountain Rescue and Safety.

1:04:47.929 --> 1:04:49.889
How about you?

1:04:49.889 --> 1:04:51.766
I'm curious, what got you
into this line of work?

1:04:53.852 --> 1:04:55.729
My college roommate.

1:04:55.729 --> 1:04:58.064
Jessica.

1:04:58.064 --> 1:05:00.775
We met freshman year
and hit it off right away.

1:05:00.775 --> 1:05:02.819
She actually introduced me
to backcountry skiing.

1:05:04.612 --> 1:05:05.655
You know
those kinds of people

1:05:05.655 --> 1:05:07.615
you think can do
just about anything?

1:05:08.783 --> 1:05:10.285
That was Jess.

1:05:10.285 --> 1:05:12.787
She was a force.

1:05:12.787 --> 1:05:13.830
And knowledgeable.

1:05:13.830 --> 1:05:16.082
I mean, by the book.

1:05:16.082 --> 1:05:17.500
One morning,

1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:20.420
Jess and two of our friends
went up Loveland Pass.

1:05:20.420 --> 1:05:23.757
I would've been with them,
but I was in an exam.

1:05:23.757 --> 1:05:25.967
Um, it got late,

1:05:25.967 --> 1:05:27.844
and they still weren't back.

1:05:30.513 --> 1:05:32.140
I almost didn't answer
the phone when it rang.

1:05:33.308 --> 1:05:35.560
I just had this awful feeling.

1:05:37.312 --> 1:05:39.230
They were skiing the steeps.

1:05:39.230 --> 1:05:40.648
Jess went last.

1:05:40.648 --> 1:05:43.610
And there was an avalanche,

1:05:43.610 --> 1:05:45.945
and she was buried.

1:05:45.945 --> 1:05:47.447
They had beacons.

1:05:47.447 --> 1:05:49.991
Got to her in 12 minutes.

1:05:49.991 --> 1:05:52.077
But it was too late.

1:05:53.620 --> 1:05:55.622
Even with all her experience,

1:05:55.622 --> 1:05:58.124
the lure
of that untouched powder

1:05:58.124 --> 1:05:59.751
was clouding her judgement.

1:06:03.588 --> 1:06:04.714
I'm so sorry.

1:06:06.174 --> 1:06:07.425
So, after that,

1:06:07.425 --> 1:06:09.719
I just threw myself

1:06:09.719 --> 1:06:12.055
into the study of snow
and avalanche forecasting,

1:06:12.055 --> 1:06:13.848
in the hopes that fewer people

1:06:13.848 --> 1:06:15.600
would ever have to go through
something like that.

1:06:17.602 --> 1:06:19.354
You know, I think...

1:06:19.354 --> 1:06:21.147
Jessica somehow knows
what you're doing...

1:06:22.357 --> 1:06:23.650
...and is honored by it.

1:06:25.443 --> 1:06:26.778
I hope so.

1:06:28.363 --> 1:06:29.614
I'm really happy I met you.

1:06:31.408 --> 1:06:32.617
Me too.

1:06:34.744 --> 1:06:36.788
Okay, here's the deal...

1:06:36.788 --> 1:06:38.707
for the rest of today,
no more shop talk. Okay?

1:06:38.707 --> 1:06:40.333
Oh, what are we
gonna talk about?

1:06:40.333 --> 1:06:41.668
Are you kidding me?

1:06:41.668 --> 1:06:43.753
I have so many questions
to ask you.

1:06:43.753 --> 1:06:44.838
Like what?

1:06:44.838 --> 1:06:46.172
Like...

1:06:46.172 --> 1:06:47.549
Like, what's
your favorite color?

1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:51.344
- Baby blue.
- Baby blue.

1:06:51.344 --> 1:06:53.346
Okay. Well, that...

1:06:53.346 --> 1:06:54.222
that seems appropriate.

1:07:00.437 --> 1:07:02.188
Mm, this is the life.

1:07:02.188 --> 1:07:03.690
So relaxing.

1:07:03.690 --> 1:07:05.525
Have you ever done
a snow angel before?

1:07:05.525 --> 1:07:07.027
A snow angel?

1:07:07.027 --> 1:07:07.986
Follow me.

1:07:07.986 --> 1:07:09.404
Come on.

1:07:09.404 --> 1:07:10.822
Uh-oh.

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:14.659
Oh!!

1:07:36.222 --> 1:07:37.349
It burns!

1:07:39.267 --> 1:07:40.643
You're amazing.

1:07:43.938 --> 1:07:46.274
All right,
here's another question.

1:07:46.274 --> 1:07:48.485
What talent do you wish you had?

1:07:48.485 --> 1:07:50.403
Mm.

1:07:50.403 --> 1:07:51.446
I wish I could paint.

1:07:51.446 --> 1:07:53.073
Really?

1:07:53.073 --> 1:07:54.366
Yeah.

1:07:54.366 --> 1:07:55.575
I mean,
how awesome would it be

1:07:55.575 --> 1:07:57.702
to sit in a beautiful place
with an easel

1:07:57.702 --> 1:07:58.745
and paint a landscape?

1:07:59.621 --> 1:08:00.955
Like this one.

1:08:00.955 --> 1:08:03.416
Right. Like live in the moment.

1:08:03.416 --> 1:08:05.085
Hmm.

1:08:05.085 --> 1:08:06.294
Never too late.

1:08:06.294 --> 1:08:07.504
True.

1:08:07.504 --> 1:08:08.880
So what about you?

1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:10.423
Oh.

1:08:10.423 --> 1:08:11.800
Uh, let's see...

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:13.802
Any kind of musical talent.

1:08:13.802 --> 1:08:17.764
Like maybe writing a song.

1:08:17.764 --> 1:08:19.015
Oh.

1:08:19.015 --> 1:08:21.893
Do you have anything
you wanna demonstrate?

1:08:23.645 --> 1:08:24.938
♪ I'm sitting here
with a girl ♪

1:08:24.938 --> 1:08:26.773
♪ In an unpredictable world ♪

1:08:26.773 --> 1:08:28.024
♪ Do-boop-boop-- ♪

1:08:28.024 --> 1:08:30.110
Maybe stick
to the mountain rescue instead.

1:08:30.110 --> 1:08:31.111
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1:08:31.111 --> 1:08:32.654
Okay.

1:08:32.654 --> 1:08:34.781
Okay, um...

1:08:34.781 --> 1:08:36.658
How about something
you've never done.

1:08:38.618 --> 1:08:39.786
Fall in love.

1:08:39.786 --> 1:08:41.788
You've never been in love?

1:08:41.788 --> 1:08:43.123
Mm-mm.

1:08:44.332 --> 1:08:45.834
Why's that?

1:08:47.002 --> 1:08:49.295
Just never given myself
the opportunity, I guess.

1:08:51.506 --> 1:08:52.465
Okay.

1:08:52.465 --> 1:08:54.342
Um...

1:08:54.342 --> 1:08:57.303
second part of that question...

1:08:57.303 --> 1:08:58.471
do you want to?

1:08:58.471 --> 1:09:00.473
Yeah.

1:09:00.473 --> 1:09:01.391
I'd like to know
how it feels.

1:09:04.686 --> 1:09:08.690
Yeah, it feels really great,
that's for sure.

1:09:10.567 --> 1:09:12.318
I had it once.

1:09:12.318 --> 1:09:13.695
With Regan.

1:09:13.695 --> 1:09:16.156
Yeah. How do you know her name?

1:09:16.156 --> 1:09:18.408
Samantha told me.

1:09:18.408 --> 1:09:20.201
I didn't realize that was her
in the photo in the lodge.

1:09:22.162 --> 1:09:23.371
Yeah.

1:09:25.790 --> 1:09:27.042
Okay, last question...

1:09:28.418 --> 1:09:31.004
...where are you the happiest?

1:09:31.004 --> 1:09:32.172
Easy.

1:09:32.172 --> 1:09:33.340
The mountains.

1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:34.966
Ah.

1:09:34.966 --> 1:09:36.676
You?

1:09:36.676 --> 1:09:37.927
Anywhere with Samantha.

1:09:37.927 --> 1:09:39.846
Mm.

1:09:39.846 --> 1:09:42.140
But...

1:09:42.140 --> 1:09:43.475
being up here with you

1:09:43.475 --> 1:09:44.976
ranks pretty high up
on that list also.

1:10:02.035 --> 1:10:05.163
Oh, it's just
an avalanche bombing.

1:10:05.163 --> 1:10:06.039
Close?

1:10:06.039 --> 1:10:07.374
No. No.

1:10:11.628 --> 1:10:12.837
So, what else you got
in that cooler?

1:10:14.798 --> 1:10:16.424
Well, let's find out, shall we?

1:10:17.467 --> 1:10:18.510
Let's see...

1:10:36.611 --> 1:10:37.696
Oh, hey!

1:10:37.696 --> 1:10:39.197
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, kiddo.

1:10:39.197 --> 1:10:40.865
So, how was it?

1:10:40.865 --> 1:10:42.242
Riley's super cool.

1:10:42.242 --> 1:10:43.993
Just like Heather.

1:10:43.993 --> 1:10:45.662
Hey.

1:10:45.662 --> 1:10:47.372
So, good time with Dad?

1:10:47.372 --> 1:10:48.998
I-- I did have fun.

1:10:48.998 --> 1:10:50.750
Yeah.

1:10:50.750 --> 1:10:51.918
Yes!

1:10:51.918 --> 1:10:53.294
Okay, let's go, kiddo.

1:10:53.294 --> 1:10:54.379
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, guys. See you later.

1:10:54.379 --> 1:10:56.297
Bye.

1:10:56.297 --> 1:10:57.882
Oh, my goodness.
Okay, tell me everything.

1:10:57.882 --> 1:10:59.342
You were right.

1:10:59.342 --> 1:11:01.594
Yes! I knew it.

1:11:01.594 --> 1:11:03.972
I've never met anyone like him.

1:11:03.972 --> 1:11:05.181
I know it sounds crazy,

1:11:05.181 --> 1:11:06.933
but under
different circumstances,

1:11:06.933 --> 1:11:08.476
I could totally see us all
being together.

1:11:09.894 --> 1:11:12.439
He and his daughter
are truly one of a kind.

1:11:12.439 --> 1:11:14.733
If there's one thing I know,

1:11:14.733 --> 1:11:16.860
it's that these feelings,

1:11:16.860 --> 1:11:18.278
they don't come along
that often.

1:11:18.278 --> 1:11:21.031
And when they do,
that's your heart speaking.

1:11:22.449 --> 1:11:24.159
And when your heart is talking,
you need to listen.

1:11:25.410 --> 1:11:26.453
Okay, Miss Matchmaker?

1:11:26.453 --> 1:11:27.912
Okay?

1:11:27.912 --> 1:11:29.914
Am I always right?

1:11:29.914 --> 1:11:31.541
- Not always.
- I'm always right!

1:11:31.541 --> 1:11:32.584
You were right once.

1:11:32.584 --> 1:11:34.544
Oh, come on.

1:11:34.544 --> 1:11:35.420
Maybe twice.

1:11:43.303 --> 1:11:44.721
Hey, guys.

1:11:44.721 --> 1:11:46.222
Heather!

1:11:46.222 --> 1:11:47.891
Hey, Sam.

1:11:47.891 --> 1:11:49.434
I can't thank you enough
for yesterday.

1:11:49.434 --> 1:11:51.019
Your dad told me
that was your special spot.

1:11:51.019 --> 1:11:52.312
And now it's yours, too.

1:11:52.312 --> 1:11:54.522
Speaking of your dad,
is he around?

1:11:54.522 --> 1:11:55.899
He's up the hill at his office.

1:11:55.899 --> 1:11:57.901
Oh, great,
maybe I'll go find him.

1:11:57.901 --> 1:11:59.486
Wait! Can I show you
what I've been teaching the pups

1:11:59.486 --> 1:12:00.528
before you go?

1:12:00.528 --> 1:12:01.529
I'd love nothing more.

1:12:01.529 --> 1:12:02.530
Okay, come on.

1:12:08.536 --> 1:12:09.746
Take.

1:12:09.746 --> 1:12:11.331
Oh, they're so cute.

1:12:20.965 --> 1:12:22.050
Knock-knock.

1:12:23.134 --> 1:12:24.010
Hey!

1:12:24.010 --> 1:12:26.012
Sorry to interrupt.

1:12:26.012 --> 1:12:27.138
No. No, it's fine.

1:12:27.138 --> 1:12:28.640
I'm just finishing up here.

1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:31.685
Did I just catch you working
with my forecasting program?

1:12:31.685 --> 1:12:34.229
No, just finishing up a report.

1:12:35.897 --> 1:12:37.774
Oh.

1:12:37.774 --> 1:12:39.150
You know, um,

1:12:39.150 --> 1:12:41.111
I've trained everyone this week
except for you.

1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:45.073
I think it'd be really nice
if you gave it a chance.

1:12:46.533 --> 1:12:47.784
Look, with all due respect,

1:12:47.784 --> 1:12:48.952
as I said before,

1:12:48.952 --> 1:12:50.328
I-- I-- I just don't need it.

1:12:53.289 --> 1:12:54.791
What do you have against
the work I'm doing here?

1:12:54.791 --> 1:12:56.710
Look, you know why.

1:12:56.710 --> 1:12:58.169
I don't trust technology.

1:12:58.169 --> 1:13:00.130
But why don't you trust it?

1:13:00.130 --> 1:13:01.715
You haven't given me
a real reason.

1:13:03.550 --> 1:13:05.760
I trust the weather.

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:08.221
And the weather
is unpredictable.

1:13:08.221 --> 1:13:10.348
And it moves faster
than your technology.

1:13:11.599 --> 1:13:14.394
And technology can't keep up
with weather in real time.

1:13:14.394 --> 1:13:15.645
It just can't.

1:13:15.645 --> 1:13:16.521
I'm not arguing that it can.

1:13:17.689 --> 1:13:18.732
Okay. Well, then...

1:13:18.732 --> 1:13:21.109
just leave it at that.

1:13:21.109 --> 1:13:22.527
I can't just leave it at that.

1:13:23.862 --> 1:13:25.989
I feel like
I've gotten to know you.

1:13:25.989 --> 1:13:27.657
I've been having
so much fun with you.

1:13:27.657 --> 1:13:28.992
But this...

1:13:28.992 --> 1:13:30.702
this attitude towards my work--

1:13:30.702 --> 1:13:31.828
my...

1:13:31.828 --> 1:13:32.871
my life's work--

1:13:32.871 --> 1:13:34.497
it's...

1:13:34.497 --> 1:13:35.707
it's disrespectful.

1:13:39.002 --> 1:13:39.878
I can't help you
with that feeling.

1:13:39.878 --> 1:13:41.588
Yes, you can!

1:13:41.588 --> 1:13:43.006
You can look at the technology

1:13:43.006 --> 1:13:45.467
and realize
that we're on the same team.

1:13:45.467 --> 1:13:47.135
My work is about
saving lives, too.

1:13:47.135 --> 1:13:48.511
Why aren't you getting that?

1:13:50.096 --> 1:13:51.639
Look, you just
don't understand.

1:13:54.726 --> 1:13:56.019
Then explain it to me.

1:13:56.019 --> 1:13:57.520
I'm sitting right here
in front of you.

1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:58.688
I'm listening.

1:13:58.688 --> 1:14:00.065
Make me understand

1:14:00.065 --> 1:14:02.275
why your work and mine
can't co-exist.

1:14:04.569 --> 1:14:05.862
Heather,

1:14:05.862 --> 1:14:07.864
we're just not gonna see
eye to eye on this.

1:14:07.864 --> 1:14:09.532
Okay?

1:14:09.532 --> 1:14:11.117
We're just not.

1:14:13.286 --> 1:14:14.537
Okay.

1:14:17.582 --> 1:14:18.667
Then, uh...

1:14:18.667 --> 1:14:19.709
Yeah, I guess.

1:14:19.709 --> 1:14:21.127
Bye, I guess.

1:14:21.127 --> 1:14:23.797
Whoa, wait. Bye?

1:14:23.797 --> 1:14:26.424
I'm leaving tomorrow, remember?

1:14:28.093 --> 1:14:29.678
And I guess...

1:14:29.678 --> 1:14:32.472
I guess you can just go back
to making your assumptions.

1:14:32.472 --> 1:14:35.433
Which is all
you seem to have for me.

1:14:36.434 --> 1:14:38.103
And, more importantly, my work.

1:14:39.437 --> 1:14:41.481
Which is based in science,
but you don't care.

1:14:43.608 --> 1:14:45.735
And I see that now.

1:14:49.114 --> 1:14:50.865
- Heather!
- <i>Chris, come in.</i>

1:14:55.078 --> 1:14:57.122
- Yeah, this is Chris.
<i>- What's your 20?</i>

1:15:05.338 --> 1:15:06.589
Do you really need to leave?

1:15:07.841 --> 1:15:08.842
I think so.

1:15:08.842 --> 1:15:10.301
Are you sure?

1:15:13.304 --> 1:15:14.723
Yeah.

1:15:45.670 --> 1:15:46.755
You okay?

1:15:48.006 --> 1:15:49.466
Ish.

1:15:49.466 --> 1:15:50.884
Yup.

1:15:50.884 --> 1:15:52.469
Really?

1:15:52.469 --> 1:15:53.762
Right.

1:15:53.762 --> 1:15:55.347
Um, excuse me, driver?

1:15:55.347 --> 1:15:56.306
We should probably get going.

1:15:56.306 --> 1:15:57.349
We don't wanna miss our flight.

1:15:57.349 --> 1:15:59.100
There's a snowstorm out there.

1:15:59.100 --> 1:16:00.477
Your flight's been canceled.

1:16:00.477 --> 1:16:01.853
Canceled?

1:16:06.608 --> 1:16:08.109
The room is yours
as long as you need it.

1:16:08.109 --> 1:16:09.569
Thanks, Eric.

1:16:09.569 --> 1:16:10.737
Chris and the other patrollers
are out on a call,

1:16:10.737 --> 1:16:12.113
so I'd better
get back to the office.

1:16:12.113 --> 1:16:13.365
What's going on?

1:16:13.365 --> 1:16:15.658
Two skiers are stranded
near Apgar Gulch.

1:16:15.658 --> 1:16:18.078
One took a fall
and is in pretty bad shape.

1:16:18.078 --> 1:16:18.953
I hope he's okay.

1:16:20.455 --> 1:16:21.331
Hey, I'm just gonna go
back to the room

1:16:21.331 --> 1:16:22.415
and do some emails.

1:16:23.375 --> 1:16:24.668
Thank you so much.

1:16:27.629 --> 1:16:28.755
You okay?

1:16:28.755 --> 1:16:29.964
I'm okay.

1:16:31.549 --> 1:16:33.677
Wasn't successful with Chris,
by the way.

1:16:35.345 --> 1:16:37.055
He could barely even
look at my weather system.

1:16:38.807 --> 1:16:39.683
But you know why, right?

1:16:40.892 --> 1:16:42.894
No, I don't, actually.

1:16:42.894 --> 1:16:46.272
Aside from him being stubborn
and disrespectful,

1:16:46.272 --> 1:16:47.774
I felt like we had a connection.

1:16:47.774 --> 1:16:49.275
His wife, Regan.

1:16:49.275 --> 1:16:50.485
It's about Regan.

1:16:51.695 --> 1:16:52.821
What about her?

1:16:54.823 --> 1:16:56.908
She went into
the backcountry one day,

1:16:56.908 --> 1:16:59.494
based off an avalanche forecast
she'd been exploring.

1:16:59.494 --> 1:17:01.413
And the area
was supposedly safe,

1:17:01.413 --> 1:17:03.373
so she never really checked
her snowpack,

1:17:03.373 --> 1:17:05.041
and then there was a slide.

1:17:06.501 --> 1:17:07.836
And the technology
at the time

1:17:07.836 --> 1:17:09.921
was not what you have today.

1:17:09.921 --> 1:17:11.798
An avalanche.

1:17:11.798 --> 1:17:13.258
That's how she died?

1:17:13.258 --> 1:17:14.467
Now you understand.

1:17:16.678 --> 1:17:17.762
The weather's changing
pretty quickly,

1:17:17.762 --> 1:17:18.972
so I'd better get back
to the station.

1:17:20.932 --> 1:17:21.850
Thanks for telling me.

1:17:22.934 --> 1:17:23.727
He's worth it, Heather.

1:17:24.978 --> 1:17:26.646
He's worth you.

1:17:26.646 --> 1:17:27.814
Thanks.

1:17:50.712 --> 1:17:51.629
Oh, no.

1:17:54.466 --> 1:17:55.425
Eric, we have a problem
at Apgar.

1:17:55.425 --> 1:17:57.260
Yeah, I spotted that, too.

1:17:57.260 --> 1:17:58.511
Have they found the skiers yet?

1:17:58.511 --> 1:17:59.596
Not yet.

1:17:59.596 --> 1:18:00.847
- Can I talk to Chris?
- Of course.

1:18:02.307 --> 1:18:03.391
Heather to Chris.

1:18:05.143 --> 1:18:06.394
This is Chris.

1:18:06.394 --> 1:18:07.729
I thought you left?

1:18:07.729 --> 1:18:08.772
<i>What's your 20?</i>

1:18:10.231 --> 1:18:11.358
<i>About 50 yards
east of Apgar.</i>

1:18:11.358 --> 1:18:13.943
Okay, stop right there.

1:18:13.943 --> 1:18:15.904
The snow on that side of Apgar
is about to give.

1:18:17.614 --> 1:18:19.199
No, it hasn't slid in years.

1:18:19.199 --> 1:18:20.742
<i>It's not gonna slide today.</i>

1:18:20.742 --> 1:18:23.912
I'm telling you, the data shows
it's ready to go any time.

1:18:23.912 --> 1:18:25.080
Eric sees it, too.

1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:26.706
Yeah, buddy, she's not lying.

1:18:26.706 --> 1:18:27.874
<i>Test the snow yourself</i>

1:18:27.874 --> 1:18:29.000
<i>if you don't believe me.</i>

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.001
No, we don't have time.

1:18:30.001 --> 1:18:31.044
The guy's in bad shape.

1:18:31.044 --> 1:18:32.212
<i>Then, please,</i>

1:18:32.212 --> 1:18:33.797
you have to trust me.

1:18:33.797 --> 1:18:35.423
Do not cross Apgar.

1:18:40.303 --> 1:18:42.222
All right,
what do you recommend we do?

1:18:42.222 --> 1:18:43.390
<i>Get up to the ridge,</i>

1:18:43.390 --> 1:18:44.349
and then descend
from the other side,

1:18:44.349 --> 1:18:45.684
and approach them from the west.

1:18:47.936 --> 1:18:48.978
I can see the skier,

1:18:48.978 --> 1:18:50.271
<i>he's just across the gulch,</i>

1:18:50.271 --> 1:18:51.481
<i>150 yards from here.</i>

1:18:51.481 --> 1:18:53.900
<i>Please, just listen to me.</i>

1:18:53.900 --> 1:18:56.236
I'm telling you,
it's much safer from there,

1:18:56.236 --> 1:18:57.696
and then you have
a clear path to ski out.

1:18:59.114 --> 1:19:00.115
What do you think?

1:19:00.115 --> 1:19:01.491
Chris, this technology's good.

1:19:03.910 --> 1:19:05.286
All right,
we're going across the ridge.

1:19:05.286 --> 1:19:06.830
<i>Over.</i>

1:19:10.333 --> 1:19:11.584
All right, let's go, guys.

1:19:40.071 --> 1:19:40.989
<i>Chris to base.</i>

1:19:42.157 --> 1:19:43.408
We have the injured skier.

1:19:43.408 --> 1:19:44.868
We're heading back.

1:19:46.161 --> 1:19:47.912
An ambulance will be waiting
for you at the bottom.

1:19:47.912 --> 1:19:49.914
10-4.

1:19:49.914 --> 1:19:50.999
You were right, Heather.

1:19:53.460 --> 1:19:55.003
All right, let's go, guys.

1:20:00.675 --> 1:20:02.010
Is my dad gonna be okay?

1:20:06.514 --> 1:20:08.016
He's gonna be just fine.

1:20:09.768 --> 1:20:11.061
I know
it might feel really scary,

1:20:11.061 --> 1:20:13.646
but you're a lucky girl.

1:20:13.646 --> 1:20:15.648
Not many kids have
a real-life hero for a dad.

1:20:16.733 --> 1:20:17.817
Your system
helped predict it.

1:20:17.817 --> 1:20:19.736
And knew something
my dad didn't.

1:20:40.674 --> 1:20:42.050
Come on, Kevin,
the ambulance is waiting.

1:20:43.635 --> 1:20:45.053
All right.
See ya, guys.

1:20:47.847 --> 1:20:49.057
Dad!

1:20:49.057 --> 1:20:50.392
Hey.

1:20:50.392 --> 1:20:51.601
Thank God, you're okay.

1:20:51.601 --> 1:20:52.852
Always, sweetie.

1:20:52.852 --> 1:20:54.062
Always.

1:20:56.856 --> 1:20:58.566
I think someone else
is glad you're okay, too.

1:21:12.372 --> 1:21:13.707
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:21:14.833 --> 1:21:15.750
I owe you.

1:21:17.210 --> 1:21:19.087
- You don't owe me anything.
- No, I owe you an apology.

1:21:21.423 --> 1:21:22.632
I can't afford
a misstep up there.

1:21:22.632 --> 1:21:24.217
And, I admit,

1:21:24.217 --> 1:21:25.844
your forecasting system, it...

1:21:27.345 --> 1:21:28.972
...it picks up on things
we could miss.

1:21:30.432 --> 1:21:31.975
I get why you hesitated
about it.

1:21:31.975 --> 1:21:34.227
Eric filled me in.

1:21:34.227 --> 1:21:35.854
You saved my life, Heather.

1:21:37.689 --> 1:21:39.190
You saved all of our lives.

1:21:41.359 --> 1:21:42.986
And, uh...

1:21:44.279 --> 1:21:46.114
I've been thinking.

1:21:47.490 --> 1:21:49.159
I don't want you to leave.

1:21:49.159 --> 1:21:50.201
I really don't.

1:21:52.704 --> 1:21:54.205
I don't think Samantha
wants you to leave either.

1:22:00.045 --> 1:22:01.880
Maybe you just wanna base
your work out of here?

1:22:04.007 --> 1:22:04.966
What do you mean?

1:22:06.217 --> 1:22:08.636
I mean, I'm sure Eric
has an office for you.

1:22:10.221 --> 1:22:11.348
And I'll bet a full-time job.

1:22:13.224 --> 1:22:15.018
And you could obviously
just continue your research.

1:22:16.144 --> 1:22:17.228
But, yeah.

1:22:17.228 --> 1:22:18.313
Move here.

1:22:19.731 --> 1:22:20.982
Be part of our team.

1:22:22.233 --> 1:22:24.569
I don't know what to say.

1:22:24.569 --> 1:22:25.570
That you'll think about it?

1:22:25.570 --> 1:22:27.614
I mean, professionally,
it's a...

1:22:27.614 --> 1:22:28.907
a big decision.

1:22:30.283 --> 1:22:31.534
But personally...

1:22:31.534 --> 1:22:32.786
maybe not?

1:22:34.204 --> 1:22:35.622
Personally?

1:22:35.622 --> 1:22:37.040
Very personal.
