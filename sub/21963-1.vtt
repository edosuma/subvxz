WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.290
*

00:26.194 --> 00:28.196
(electricity crackling)

00:30.198 --> 00:31.599
(zapping sound)

00:31.632 --> 00:32.900
(ethereal whooshing)

00:34.202 --> 00:35.869
I may be in trouble.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.771
If anything happens to me,
find Detective Leroy Wright

00:37.805 --> 00:39.973
and Dr. Max Jennifer.
They can help.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.446
(distorted groaning)

00:52.620 --> 00:53.921
Hey, uh, excuse me.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.055
If you're really
into the mechanics

00:55.089 --> 00:56.424
of unmanned space flight,

00:56.457 --> 00:57.591
I'd go with the
one on the right.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.593
Oh. It's a gift
for my husband.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.595
Always tough picking out.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.431
Oh, yeah, I know
how that goes.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.798
You married?
Yeah.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.701
Or no. Sort of.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.737
Oh, are you going
through a divorce?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.605
No, no, no, no,
nothing like that.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.241
God, how awkward would that be?

01:13.274 --> 01:16.043
No, uh, she was abducted
by aliens.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.078
Sweetie.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.913
Okay, I know what you're
thinking. I am not crazy.
Come here.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.782
Actually, I was a
professor at Stanford.
Put down.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.784
Astrophysics. That
is a cute child.
Time to go. Yup. Okay.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.053
Let's go look at my phone.
You know, even if I was crazy,

01:26.086 --> 01:27.988
it doesn't mean you can't buy
the book for your husband.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.857
They're unrelated.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.794
MAN:
Listen here, Jermaine,

01:33.827 --> 01:36.164
your dad and I spent 15 years
together on the LAPD

01:36.197 --> 01:38.966
before I started working
at this disgusting mall

01:38.999 --> 01:41.735
and he always told me
his dream was for you

01:41.769 --> 01:43.504
to go to college.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.738
So...

01:44.772 --> 01:46.607
Aw.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.010
SAT prep course?

01:50.043 --> 01:51.612
Dude, I'm 12.
MOTHER:
Jermaine, say thank you.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.080
That was very kind.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.515
JERMAINE:
Thank you.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.384
Turn to page 60,
you little bitch.

01:58.819 --> 01:59.787
There's a video...

01:59.820 --> 02:01.789
(shushing)
Quiet.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.691
Now, when you get to level 18,
give me a call,

02:03.724 --> 02:05.193
'cause there's some tricky stuff
I got to walk you through.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.694
And if I hear

02:06.727 --> 02:08.496
that you haven't
been studying, I'm-a come

02:08.529 --> 02:10.664
see you, and it's not gonna be
pretty. Do you understand?

02:10.698 --> 02:12.099
Yes, sir. I
understand you, sir.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.334
Good, becau...

02:13.367 --> 02:14.935
Oh, Eddie! Come on, man!

02:14.968 --> 02:17.037
What's up, Leroy?

02:17.070 --> 02:19.307
Other crazy people
got to drink out of there!

02:19.340 --> 02:20.808
At least aim it!

02:20.841 --> 02:21.809
I got to mop that up.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.211
Excuse me.

02:23.244 --> 02:26.013
(muttering):
Pee in the damn fountain...

02:28.148 --> 02:30.150
(shouts)

02:31.352 --> 02:33.354
*

02:34.388 --> 02:36.324
Oh, cool,

02:36.357 --> 02:38.826
you're awake. What's
up? How's it going?

02:38.859 --> 02:41.462
I'm-I'm Max.
What's your name?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.664
Leroy.
Leroy. Hi.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.333
I've been awake
for a few minutes,

02:45.366 --> 02:47.535
taken-taken stock
of our situation here.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.204
It appears we're-we're
in the back of some sort of van.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.139
I see that.
What do we do? You
have a uniform on.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.341
What do we do?

02:53.374 --> 02:54.575
First thing to do
is remain calm.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.844
What do we do, man?
Don't yell at me, okay?

02:56.877 --> 02:58.312
I'm not yelling
at you. I'm not.
Well, you just kind of

02:58.346 --> 02:59.547
yelled at me.
Well, okay. I'm sorry.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.048
"What do we do, man?"
Yeah, that was yelling.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.049
I apologize.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.317
Oh, dear.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.818
You're not supposed
to be awake yet.

03:04.852 --> 03:05.819
Who the hell are you?!

03:05.853 --> 03:06.820
Why did you take us?!

03:06.854 --> 03:08.055
I'm Barry.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.490
I'm your kidnapper.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.359
And I work for a top secret
government agency.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.594
And, unfortunately,

03:13.627 --> 03:16.297
that's all I can say
about that.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.666
That's not very fair, is it?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.067
I work for
the Bureau Underground.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.569
We investigate the paranormal

03:21.602 --> 03:23.771
and anything outside
the scientific realm.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.773
Is this a hidden camera show?
Where's Alex Trebek?

03:25.806 --> 03:27.341
Wait, did Alex Trebek have
a hidden camera show?
(tires screech)

03:27.375 --> 03:29.443
How did I miss that?
Oh!

03:29.477 --> 03:31.211
Looks like
we've arrived.
What...

03:31.245 --> 03:32.246
Stay away from me! Stay...
What are you doing?

03:32.280 --> 03:33.247
What are
you doing?

03:33.281 --> 03:34.548
Nuh...

03:34.582 --> 03:36.584
*

03:43.156 --> 03:44.558
What the hell?

03:45.459 --> 03:46.794
Where are we?

03:46.827 --> 03:49.062
And who are we?
And what do we want?

03:49.096 --> 03:51.432
I'm sure you must have
a million questions

03:51.465 --> 03:53.601
that I'm not gonna answer.
Straighten your leg.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.269
Wh-What are you doing?

03:55.303 --> 03:57.938
I am measuring in case I need
to build you body armor.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.239
Or a coffin.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.709
Probably just body armor.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.944
They're awake!

04:03.977 --> 04:05.313
How are they?

04:05.346 --> 04:06.780
YOUNG WOMAN:
Not great.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.216
Gentlemen,
I will keep this brief.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.886
I am Captain LaFrey, and this is
the Bureau Underground.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.822
Two days ago,
one of

04:14.855 --> 04:16.657
our finest agents,
Mike Checker, disappeared.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.258
That same day, he sent us this.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.227
I may be in trouble.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.929
If anything happens to me,
find Detective Leroy Wright

04:21.962 --> 04:24.932
and Dr. Max Jennifer.
They can help.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.166
Checker thought
that you can help,

04:26.199 --> 04:27.901
and I hope like
hell you can.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.570
Here's my offer:

04:29.603 --> 04:32.072
one mission, two days.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.408
Are you in?
Hell no.

04:34.442 --> 04:37.478
Yeah, I'm sorry, but
why would we help you?

04:37.511 --> 04:39.980
You were
a brilliant astrophysicist,

04:40.013 --> 04:41.315
but Stanford--

04:41.349 --> 04:42.816
they called you
crazy.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.585
Well, guess what,
I think they're wrong.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.286
I can help you clear

04:46.320 --> 04:50.123
your name and get
your job back, Professor.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.495
Okay, I'm in.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.196
Are you kidding?
What?

04:56.229 --> 04:58.265
I've never seen this Checker
before in my life.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.667
Yeah, but he asked for us
specifically.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.668
They kidnapped us!

05:00.701 --> 05:02.002
Okay.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.437
What do you
care what I do?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.105
I'm just concerned that
this might be, like,

05:05.138 --> 05:07.174
a package deal-type thing.
I'm getting the vibe

05:07.207 --> 05:09.377
it's, like, a package
deal-type thing or...

05:09.410 --> 05:10.544
I have to go.

05:10.578 --> 05:11.812
I have things to do.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.847
Like what?
Like meet up
with my boys.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.383
We meet at the Panera Bread
every morning

05:15.416 --> 05:16.950
and discuss world affairs.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.886
And I'm kind of like
the unofficial leader.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.287
Unless Jerry's
there. Then it gets

05:20.320 --> 05:21.522
all weird,
'cause they're not really

05:21.555 --> 05:24.191
into him like that.
He's so aggressive.
Right.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.527
Well, that is incredibly sad,
Leroy, especially

05:26.560 --> 05:30.197
since you were the best missing
persons detective the LAPD

05:30.230 --> 05:31.465
ever had.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.700
Tell you what,

05:32.733 --> 05:36.537
you help me find Checker,

05:36.570 --> 05:38.639
I'll get you back
on the force.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.674
The Bureau Underground
was created

05:40.708 --> 05:42.510
under the Truman administration

05:42.543 --> 05:44.311
to protect humanity
from paranormal forces

05:44.344 --> 05:47.047
that threaten
our existence.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.517
Extraterrestrials,
poltergeists, cryptids.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.686
Have y'all seen a yeti?
Yes.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.522
Our field agents are equipped
with the latest

05:54.555 --> 05:57.024
in weapons technology
thanks to Annie Carver,

05:57.057 --> 05:59.693
our weapons and tech expert.

05:59.727 --> 06:03.897
Unidentifiable evidence
is handled by Dr. Barry Shaw.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.666
If you ever tell anyone
of our existence,

06:05.699 --> 06:07.568
we will do everything
in our power to make sure

06:07.601 --> 06:10.538
no one believes a word
you say ever again.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.273
Let's get to work.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.776
Agent Checker

06:15.809 --> 06:17.277
kept us largely in the dark

06:17.310 --> 06:18.846
on his last investigation,
but we believe

06:18.879 --> 06:21.348
that it had something to
do with travel through...

06:21.381 --> 06:23.751
the multiverse.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.420
MAX:
The multiverse?

06:26.454 --> 06:29.857
I literally wrote the book
on the multiverse.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.594
I know. He didn't ask for you
'cause he liked your smile.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.596
Hold on. You mean...

06:35.629 --> 06:37.931
So this is real?

06:37.965 --> 06:39.399
I was right?

06:41.001 --> 06:42.369
Okay, ding-dong!
Ding-dong!

06:42.402 --> 06:44.938
If I'm gonna do this,
let's bring it back

06:44.972 --> 06:46.640
to Earth for a second.
Where was Checker last seen?

06:46.674 --> 06:49.643
Did you go to his house?
You talk to his wife?

06:49.677 --> 06:51.244
Checker never married,
no close relatives,

06:51.278 --> 06:53.080
and his apartment
was clean.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.415
Do you have access to
his cell phone location records?

06:55.449 --> 06:58.452
Cross-reference the cell
phone data with the location

06:58.486 --> 06:59.453
of his credit card
charges.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.654
Lay those
two maps

07:00.688 --> 07:01.655
on top of
one another.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.823
What do we got?

07:02.856 --> 07:06.059
Looks like a gas station
and a storage facility.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.129
Bingo. Checker had
a storage space.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.163
Did you know
about that?

07:10.197 --> 07:12.099
No.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.734
Start there. See what you find.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.735
Good luck.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.269
You have 48 hours.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.938
(quietly):
Cool.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.107
Ooh, is that from right now,
or when we got kidnapped, or...?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.842
Leave.
I know. That's cool.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.410
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.845
MAX:
You know, at MIT,

07:24.878 --> 07:26.246
it was just, you know,

07:26.279 --> 07:28.816
"Max Jennifer:
Academic Superstar.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.818
Blah, blah, blah."
You know? I was...

07:30.851 --> 07:34.154
(music begins playing)
Inside, I was still
just this angry teenager.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.355
* And we try to see... *

07:35.388 --> 07:36.456
Okay, I'm yammering.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.791
Uh, what about you?

07:37.825 --> 07:39.259
W-What's it like
being a detective?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.961
Is it cool or is it weird?

07:40.994 --> 07:44.297
* Bring me a higher love... *

07:44.331 --> 07:45.999
Hey, what happened
with you and the LAPD?

07:46.033 --> 07:48.602
* Bring me a higher love *

07:48.636 --> 07:50.638
* Oh, uh... *

07:50.671 --> 07:52.540
Nothing happened with you
and the LAPD.
* Higher love *

07:52.573 --> 07:53.774
Okay, great.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.677
* Higher love... *

07:56.710 --> 07:59.012
What happened with you
and the LAP...
(vocalizing)

07:59.046 --> 08:00.447
What happened with you

08:00.480 --> 08:01.549
and the LAPD?!
What happened?
(yelling)

08:01.582 --> 08:03.551
Higher love!
Hey! Listen, man.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.485
You have
a beautiful voice, okay?

08:05.519 --> 08:06.687
There, I said it.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.221
But if we're gonna be partners,

08:08.255 --> 08:09.857
we're gonna have to open up
to each other

08:09.890 --> 08:11.158
and have a conversation
at some point.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.160
(tires screeching)

08:15.028 --> 08:16.296
Number one,

08:16.329 --> 08:18.999
we are not partners.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.200
Number two...

08:20.233 --> 08:21.735
(door opens)
What are you doing?

08:21.769 --> 08:22.903
Get out.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.305
What?
Go ahead. Get out.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.574
The yellow brick road
ends here, Toto.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.708
Are you serious?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.009
Yeah.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.310
You want me
to get out the car.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.179
I want you
to get out of the car.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.087
Take care.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.155
Listen, Leroy,

08:42.189 --> 08:45.092
the past couple years,
I have lost everything,

08:45.125 --> 08:49.096
and everyone, good in my life,
'cause they all think I'm nuts.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.231
Okay?

08:51.264 --> 08:53.100
So I need this.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.703
Please.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.540
(sighs)

09:00.574 --> 09:01.842
Fine.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.244
*

09:04.277 --> 09:06.513
(brakes squeak)

09:06.546 --> 09:09.282
What freaky stuff are you
hiding in here, Checker?

09:09.316 --> 09:11.251
Books.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.721
(gasps)
Oh, my God, Leroy.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.923
This is amazing.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.390
Checker was
reading my book.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.692
How cool is that?

09:18.726 --> 09:19.893
Oh.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.128
Should I sign it?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.530
You should totally
sign it, yeah.
Right?

09:23.563 --> 09:25.198
He's clearly a fan.
Shh. I'm trying to think.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.466
All right.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.402
Time for clues.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.504
"Are you in the dark?"

09:34.141 --> 09:36.276
What are you doing?

09:39.647 --> 09:42.549
Damn, what is this?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.117
Whoa.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.820
LEROY: It all leads to
Waterbridge nuclear power plant.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.589
What the hell?

09:49.623 --> 09:50.824
Max Jennifer, Ph...
Let's go.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.926
Yeah. Okay.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.567
Annie hacked the perimeter
security feed

10:00.600 --> 10:02.335
at Waterbridge
nuclear power plant.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.072
Turns out Checker was working
undercover there

10:05.105 --> 10:06.406
before he
disappeared.
Affirmative.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.808
We need you to
get inside that reactor

10:07.841 --> 10:09.910
and find out what Checker
was doing.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.344
Well, how are we
gonna do that?

10:11.378 --> 10:14.081
Those places are guarded
with, like, small armies.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.849
Stand by, gentlemen.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.391
(beeping)

10:25.225 --> 10:26.593
Hi. Yeah, the printer is jammed.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.428
Well, isn't that just the worst.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.463
I'm gonna send over two
of my best guys.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.867
Just be quiet
and follow my lead.

10:33.901 --> 10:37.170
Uh, I did a little improv in
college, okay? I think I'm good.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.872
LEROY: We'll take
it from here.
Oh, actually,

10:38.906 --> 10:40.607
if you could show me how
to fix it, that'd be great.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.209
These things jam
all the time.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.444
Just gonna
set down my tools.
Oh.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.614
And this will probably be a-a
while, so you might want to...

10:47.647 --> 10:49.717
Oh, that's okay.
I'm not busy.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.219
All right.

10:52.252 --> 10:55.889
Uh, Max, you-you want to
show her how to fix it?

10:55.923 --> 10:58.726
Sure, David.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.527
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.698
This is one of those, uh...
This is a copy machine.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.133
Uh-huh.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.667
I'm, uh, more of
a fax machine guy.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.236
"Max the Fax Machine Guy."

11:09.269 --> 11:11.071
If-if my name was Max,
that's what it would be.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.305
But my name is...

11:12.339 --> 11:14.842
S-Steve.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.744
Okay. Well, Steve,
Nice to meet you. Yeah.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.678
Uh, that's actually a
fax machine; it's both.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.249
This is both of those things.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.751
Two in one.
Yeah, sure.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.686
So since this is a-an
all-in-one wrap-around,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.055
I think that's more
your specialty.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.923
LEROY:
Well, I mean,

11:29.957 --> 11:31.825
since I'm your boss, maybe you
should just go ahead and do it.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.828
All right,
but right before this,

11:34.862 --> 11:36.830
I talked to Sanchez.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.832
He promoted me.
I'm in charge now.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.567
Congrats.
LEROY:
Well, that's interesting,

11:40.600 --> 11:41.668
'cause Sanchez got fired.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.070
That's enough back talk, bro!

11:43.103 --> 11:44.271
Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna go.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.705
No. I want you to see this.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.240
Why? She doesn't need to.
(grunts)

11:47.274 --> 11:49.676
You will show me
the respect I've earned.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.544
Yeah, I can't be here for this.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.213
(door opens, closes)

11:53.246 --> 11:54.681
And... scene.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.883
That was great.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.117
Did you feel that?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.385
Could you feel it?

11:58.418 --> 12:01.354
Watch your face.
What does that mean?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.256
Let's go. Let's go.
Wait. You're not joking?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.358
Whoa. Wow.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.794
Uh, okay.
This is our first mission.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.428
It's a big moment.
Uh... What do I do?

12:08.461 --> 12:09.930
Try being quiet.
Okay.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.732
Look.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.301
That's weird.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.635
That looks like
a magnetic coil.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.104
What's it doing here?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.538
Get a pic; let's go.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.473
Yeah, yeah. You're
right. Uh... okay.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.775
LEROY: Give me
the phone.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.277
How do you focus this thing?

12:24.311 --> 12:26.646
It's so blurry.
(screams)

12:26.679 --> 12:28.548
You're not supposed to be here.
You're right.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.583
Let's go! Let's go!
(computer beeping)

12:32.319 --> 12:35.055
Guys, stay calm, everything
is gonna be just fine, probably.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.589
We're in the reactor room
of building C.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.558
Security's tracking us.
We need a way out now.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.261
There's a door in the
northwest corner. You see it?

12:41.294 --> 12:43.163
Negative, negative! We can't go
that way. What else you got?

12:43.196 --> 12:45.498
(gunshot)
(screams)

12:45.532 --> 12:47.400
Oh, oh. Is everything okay?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.969
Get down to the lower level.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.804
Hang in there, chaps. I'm
thinking of you. Oh, God.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.639
MAX: I can't believe
you let me come with you.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.474
You begged me, remember?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.476
(whiny voice):
Leroy, please, I need this.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.846
Everybody hates me.
I'm a loser.
(rapid gunshots)

12:58.879 --> 12:59.913
All right, bottom floor.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.081
To your right there is an exit.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.315
I'm gonna try and open it.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.251
(gunshots)
(grunts)

13:04.284 --> 13:06.186
They have guns and bullets
and we are frightened.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.354
Annie.
Sorry. Sorry, I hear that.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.655
I hear the guns. I'm so sorry.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.257
I repeat. We are very,
very frightened.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.591
LEROY:
Come on, man. Let's go!

13:11.624 --> 13:12.926
Annie, come on.
Get 'em out of there.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.761
ANNIE:
Hold on.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.663
Almost there.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.131
(alarm blaring)

13:18.165 --> 13:19.332
Got it.
(beeps)

13:20.733 --> 13:22.769
MAX:
Okay, the magnetic coil

13:22.802 --> 13:26.506
at the power plant was illegally
syphoning electricity,

13:26.539 --> 13:28.976
which means there has to be
a second coil

13:29.009 --> 13:31.811
somewhere receiving it.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.046
But what do they need
all that power for?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.982
I bet Checker knew
and they got him.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.483
LaFREY:
Annie, see if there are any

13:36.516 --> 13:39.552
large-scale deviations
in the magnetic field.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.388
We find that second coil...

13:41.421 --> 13:42.622
We find Checker.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.791
Yes.
BARRY:
Meanwhile,

13:44.824 --> 13:46.960
how are you
guys doing, huh?

13:46.994 --> 13:48.728
I know getting shot
at can be stressful.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.497
Can I get you anything?

13:50.530 --> 13:52.065
Yes. I'll take a PB and J.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.700
Good... Yes.
No crusts, extra "J."

13:53.733 --> 13:55.068
Yes. Mm-hmm.
No PB.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.137
(computer beeping)
Captain, large-scale disturbance

13:57.170 --> 13:58.505
in the magnetic
field downtown.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.973
This is it.
This is it.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.042
Okay, okay, okay, okay...
Go. Go, you guys.
Get downtown. It's Checker.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.043
We getting paid for this?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.211
Go, go, go, go, go.
LaFREY: Quickly.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.245
MAX:
Come on, Leroy.

14:07.714 --> 14:08.681
(tires screech)

14:08.715 --> 14:09.983
So, in the multiverse,

14:10.017 --> 14:12.886
there's another universe
exactly like ours.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.387
So there's another me,
there's another you,

14:14.421 --> 14:16.256
but that Max and Leroy

14:16.289 --> 14:18.191
probably don't even
know each other, right?

14:18.225 --> 14:20.060
What about Kevin Spacey?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.895
Kevin Spacey.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.496
Is there another
Kevin Spacey?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.265
Well, yeah, sure.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.367
Really good example--
of course there is.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.902
I think we got the
best Kevin Spacey.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.570
Yeah. Well,

14:30.603 --> 14:32.672
I mean, s...
Keyser Soze.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.873
I'm sorry?

14:33.907 --> 14:35.708
Keyser Soze.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.045
But actually, what I was
kind of getting at

14:38.078 --> 14:40.347
was, if it is possible to travel

14:40.380 --> 14:42.215
through the multiverse,
like Checker asserts,

14:42.249 --> 14:44.851
then we are open to attack
from anywhere.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.286
I got a question.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.221
Yeah.
What happened
with your wife?

14:48.255 --> 14:50.857
Well, you know what happened;
I told you, she was abducted.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.093
But the night she disappeared,
what happened?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.594
She, uh... You know,
we were just at home.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.596
Um, we'd had a small fight.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.365
Actually, not that small.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.934
Um, and she was, you know, she
was just, like, packing a bag.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.470
She was packing
after a fight?
Yeah, Leroy.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.572
People do all kinds of things
when they get abducted.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.707
They're riding a bike--
bam, you're abducted.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.642
I mean, that...
Your wife left you, Max.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.379
No, she did not.
I've seen it a
thousand times.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.114
She's probably on a beach in
the Bahamas with Kevin Spacey.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.549
No. No, she wouldn't
do that to me.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.386
Look do you think that I haven't
questioned my own sanity, Leroy?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.088
I do, all the time.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.623
But I have faith
that I'm not crazy.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.158
Well, I don't.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.327
MAX:
What are you doing?

15:27.360 --> 15:28.495
What's going on?

15:28.528 --> 15:30.330
Leroy.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.732
You're staying here 'cause
you're certifiably nuts

15:32.765 --> 15:34.634
and you might
get me killed.
No, no.

15:34.667 --> 15:35.635
Leroy. Wait.

15:35.668 --> 15:36.669
(sighs)
Thank you.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.405
No. Forgot my Fitbit.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.840
Got to get my steps in.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.675
What?

15:42.709 --> 15:44.377
Leroy!

15:45.445 --> 15:47.614
Leroy!

15:47.647 --> 15:49.816
This is a real
bummer, man!

15:53.653 --> 15:55.955
(sighs)

15:55.989 --> 15:57.991
(clattering nearby)

16:00.660 --> 16:01.828
Whoa!

16:01.861 --> 16:03.263
Leroy!

16:03.296 --> 16:05.865
Leroy!

16:05.898 --> 16:07.000
Leroy!

16:07.034 --> 16:09.369
Whoa! Whoa!

16:17.044 --> 16:19.979
(quietly):
Come on, Checker, where are you?

16:21.548 --> 16:23.883
(whirring)

16:23.916 --> 16:26.353
(screams, grunts)

16:26.386 --> 16:28.955
Max!

16:28.988 --> 16:30.290
What the hell, man?!

16:30.323 --> 16:31.891
I could have died in there!

16:31.924 --> 16:33.493
What is wrong with you?

16:33.526 --> 16:36.129
Aw, somebody need a hug?

16:36.163 --> 16:38.165
Everything's a joke for you.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.532
You know?
Want to go

16:39.566 --> 16:41.301
to an independent coffeehouse
and talk it out?

16:41.334 --> 16:45.172
What happened with you
in the LAPD, anyway?

16:45.205 --> 16:48.041
Don't go that way.
Let me guess, you did
something psychotic.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.042
Am I getting warmer?
Leave it alone.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.243
Why don't you tell me,

16:50.277 --> 16:53.046
then, what happened
with you and the LAPD?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.847
I got my partner killed!

16:54.881 --> 16:57.050
I made the call
to go in without backup,

16:57.084 --> 17:00.487
he followed and got shot--
is that what you want to hear?

17:00.520 --> 17:01.888
Not really.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.190
I mean, that's...

17:03.223 --> 17:04.591
an incredibly
sad story.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.527
I'm so sorry.
I locked you in the car...

17:07.560 --> 17:10.197
'cause I didn't want it
to happen again.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.998
That's a very
thoughtful thing to do,

17:12.031 --> 17:13.766
as it turns out.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.935
And... if you don't mind,
I'd like to take you up

17:15.968 --> 17:17.070
on that hug you
offered earlier.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.171
I know you were kidding,

17:18.205 --> 17:19.939
but check this out.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.210
There we go, yeah.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.678
(patting Leroy)
See?

17:25.712 --> 17:28.014
Hey! That thing
attacked the car.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.349
Checker might
be in there.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.351
Stay your skinny ass
behind me.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.919
Okay.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.358
(quietly): Something's
going on over there.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.060
My God, this is so scary.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.533
Lift me up. I'm gonna
peek through the vent.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.801
Yeah, okay. Or-or just,
like, for logistical reasons,

17:48.835 --> 17:50.803
maybe we do that
the other way around?

17:50.837 --> 17:52.071
Why?

17:53.473 --> 17:55.942
Um... no...

17:55.975 --> 17:58.311
Yeah, no, you're right.
I'm just messing with
you, dude. Come on.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.712
Thank God. Okay.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.747
Okay.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.949
(panting)

18:07.854 --> 18:08.955
MAX (whispering):
Checker.

18:08.988 --> 18:09.956
They got Checker.

18:09.989 --> 18:10.957
You see Checker?
Yeah.

18:10.990 --> 18:11.991
Nice.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.465
You got to let me down.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.567
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What happened?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.502
Remember the big guy?
The big guy from the...

18:22.535 --> 18:23.736
the power plant?

18:23.770 --> 18:24.937
Yeah.
He's in there.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.273
He took his own head off,

18:26.306 --> 18:28.241
and he just, like,
set it on a table.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.243
Hey, when I left you
back at the car,

18:30.277 --> 18:32.312
Yeah?
did you get super high?

18:32.345 --> 18:33.646
Because you
sound stupid.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.582
Oh, I sound stupid.
Really?
You sound stupid.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.584
See for yourself.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.552
(strained grunting)

18:42.054 --> 18:43.590
MAX:
Oh, my God.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.891
(strained grunting continues)

18:52.232 --> 18:53.466
What the...?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.101
Right?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.503
Listen to me,
we have to distract him.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.305
We have to get that big guy
out of there

18:58.338 --> 18:59.939
Yeah.
so we can go in and get Checker.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.208
Good, good, that's good.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.042
Okay, you go in
and grab the head.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.712
When he follows you out, I'll
stay back and get Checker.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.480
Or, just, like,
as a different idea,

19:07.514 --> 19:10.483
you go in there
and y get the head...

19:10.517 --> 19:12.352
What, you're scared of heads?

19:12.385 --> 19:15.021
It's okay, we're all scared
of something, you know?

19:15.054 --> 19:16.956
I'm scared of ducks.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.125
You're scared of ducks?
Well, you...
I don't trust them.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.160
You know what,
don't even talk about 'em,
don't even talk about 'em.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.562
Fine. I mean,
what-what am I thinking?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.564
I'm n gonna go in
and get the head?

19:24.597 --> 19:25.965
You got to go get the head.
Of course. Yeah.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.000
*

19:35.708 --> 19:38.245
(whispers):
Hey, what's up?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.318
(screams)

19:45.352 --> 19:47.086
(screams)

19:47.119 --> 19:48.087
Abort!

19:48.120 --> 19:49.188
(screams)

19:49.222 --> 19:51.891
(screaming)

19:53.926 --> 19:55.362
(screams)

20:03.270 --> 20:05.772
(head groaning)
What the hell is this thing?
Shut it up.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.173
Um, excuse me, sir?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.175
Hi. I-I'm gonna need you
to be quiet.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.510
(groaning)
Sir, I don't want

20:10.543 --> 20:12.345
to have to ask you again.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.415
(groaning continues in distance)

20:15.448 --> 20:17.384
Shut up.
Shut up.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.352
I swear, I'll do it.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.087
No, let's be nice,
let's be nice.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.689
(gasps in pain)
He bit me, he bit me.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.023
Shut up.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.392
He's biting me,
he's biting me.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.159
It hurts, hurts.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.666
(panting):
All right, listen...

20:35.735 --> 20:36.969
Aah! Oh!

20:37.003 --> 20:39.606
(gunshots)
Take it, take it.

20:41.974 --> 20:42.975
You okay?

20:43.009 --> 20:44.611
Yeah.
Come on.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.479
We got to get to Checker
before he does.
Yeah.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.716
He's gone.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.717
(whirring)

20:50.750 --> 20:52.385
The roof.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.086
Checker!

20:56.856 --> 20:58.858
Checker.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.428
It's real.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.496
It's all real.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.638
Hey!

21:11.671 --> 21:13.005
Don't move.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.974
Uh, please don't hurt me.
Who are you?

21:15.007 --> 21:16.576
And who put your head back on?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.745
I didn't...

21:18.778 --> 21:20.279
I-I don't remember
anything.

21:20.313 --> 21:23.316
They took Checker up...
up in the spaceship.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.951
Spaceship?

21:26.486 --> 21:29.255
Oh, come on-- you
didn't just see that?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.523
You're sure
you're not high?

21:30.557 --> 21:31.924
MAX:
Okay, so he said

21:31.958 --> 21:33.960
that something was
controlling his body, right?

21:33.993 --> 21:36.028
So my theory is,
is that the light

21:36.062 --> 21:38.365
was some sort
of extraterrestrial

21:38.398 --> 21:40.266
or multidimensional
life force

21:40.299 --> 21:42.301
that had taken over
his body.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.636
Why was the head
yelling?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.304
The head should
not have been yelling.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.839
That is
a good question.

21:46.873 --> 21:49.676
And one that we
intend to answer.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.310
I'm kind of sorry
to see you both go.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.646
But a deal is a deal.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.182
Leroy, we're gonna get you
back on at the LAPD. And, Max,

21:56.215 --> 21:58.117
Stanford is a no-go,
but good news is,

21:58.150 --> 22:00.387
we got you reinstated
at the bookstore.
Whoa, whoa.

22:00.420 --> 22:03.055
Hold on. No, no, no. No.
Our mission isn't over.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.392
Look, I just found out
that everything

22:05.425 --> 22:08.194
I was called crazy
for believing is real.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.830
We can do something
about this.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.532
LEROY:
I want to find this dude.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.034
I mean, we were
right there.
Yeah.

22:15.067 --> 22:18.337
("Higher Love" by Steve Winwood
playing)

22:20.106 --> 22:21.240
All right.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.676
All right.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.645
Gentlemen...

22:25.678 --> 22:28.481
welcome
to the Bureau Underground.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.482
* Think about it *

22:29.516 --> 22:30.883
(chuckles):
What?

22:30.917 --> 22:32.752
* There must be higher love *

22:32.785 --> 22:34.521
Congrats, man.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.522
Wow!

22:35.555 --> 22:37.990
Congrats to you, partner.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.092
Okay, you just
called me part...
Shwaa!

22:40.126 --> 22:41.828
I, uh, I just heard

22:41.861 --> 22:43.162
the good news, huh?

22:43.195 --> 22:44.497
Congratulations.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.598
Nice to have

22:45.632 --> 22:46.833
a couple of dudes

22:46.866 --> 22:48.701
in the old henhouse. Ugh.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.170
(chuckles) Yeah, he
doesn't have a lot

22:51.203 --> 22:52.171
of male friends.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.172
Or any friends at all.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.408
What's going on
over there?

22:55.442 --> 22:57.710
Oh, uh, that's just
a group of people

22:57.744 --> 22:59.512
we've been monitoring
who have

22:59.546 --> 23:01.714
a remarkably similar
abduction story to your...

23:01.748 --> 23:03.382
big man today.

23:04.484 --> 23:05.785
Oh, my God.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.620
LEROY:
What?

23:08.821 --> 23:10.757
