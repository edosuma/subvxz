00:14.101 --> 00:15.319
This can't be good!

00:15.363 --> 00:17.017
You mean all the alarms
and stuff?

00:17.060 --> 00:18.844
Yeah!
We're too heavy!

00:18.888 --> 00:21.456
If we don't drop some cargo,
we're dead, man.

00:21.499 --> 00:24.024
Oh, well. It's not like I have
anything to live for.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.025
Then who's that?

00:25.068 --> 00:27.331
Oh, right, my son!

00:27.375 --> 00:29.333
My son
and his eight siblings!

00:34.208 --> 00:36.688
I don't know what to drop!

00:36.732 --> 00:38.690
It all looks so important!

00:38.734 --> 00:40.388
Just pick something!

00:57.318 --> 01:00.625
It's gonna be
a great pool day.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.411
I'm in the middle
of a speed run of this game.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.544
I can't swim with my "mama"
right now.

You have reached

01:58.292 --> 01:59.597
Y'all wanna come swim?

01:59.641 --> 02:01.599
Can't. Learning.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.602
Jeff and I have decided to
become more well-rounded people

02:04.646 --> 02:07.431
and are learning
vocabulary words.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.954
I've learned perfidious.

02:08.998 --> 02:10.956
Do you know what it means,
Francine?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.133
I don't know,
stank-ass or something?

02:13.176 --> 02:16.136
It means deceitful
and untrustworthy.

02:16.179 --> 02:19.139
And I learned
the word "vocabulary."

02:21.184 --> 02:23.621
I can't. I'm busy working
on my dating app.

02:23.665 --> 02:26.798
It's like Tinder or Hinge,
but mine has a different name.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.409
It's called
Barrel Scraper.

02:28.452 --> 02:31.716
Like scraping the bottom
of the barrel?

02:31.760 --> 02:33.936
Oh, no!
I forgot about that phrase!

02:33.979 --> 02:35.764
I was thinking
a barrel of laughs

02:35.807 --> 02:38.810
and a skyscraper
of a good time.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.899
Help! I'm drowning!

02:40.943 --> 02:41.987
Stan, help!

02:43.293 --> 02:44.990
Ha! Gotcha!

02:45.034 --> 02:47.167
Doesn't the pool
look so nice?

02:47.210 --> 02:48.646
Why don't you join me?

02:48.690 --> 02:50.648
I'm just out here because
I got ketchup on my toes

02:50.692 --> 02:52.998
and needed to wipe it off
in the grass.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.222
Francine, can you please
keep it down?

02:59.266 --> 03:01.833
I can hear you drowning from
all the way across the street.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.183
It's almost noon.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.185
Why are you still
in your pajamas?

03:05.228 --> 03:07.317
I'm trying to get 18 hours
of sleep a day

03:07.361 --> 03:09.232
to prepare
for an audition next week.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.626
A scout is coming to watch me
perform the news,

03:11.669 --> 03:13.758
and it could be
my big break to go national.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.847
- That's exciting!
- I know!

03:15.891 --> 03:18.198
But I really have to nail
my mood maneuvers.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.634
You know when news anchors
have to switch

03:19.677 --> 03:21.505
from happy stories
to sad stories,

03:21.549 --> 03:23.681
seamlessly transitioning
from an upbeat inflection

03:23.725 --> 03:24.813
to a grave one?

03:24.856 --> 03:25.857
That's a mood maneuver.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.294
Example please.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.600
Francine Smith drowned
in her pool,

03:29.644 --> 03:31.428
which was good
for Greg because he finally

03:31.472 --> 03:32.821
got some sleep.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.277
Did you come
to admire the pool?

03:54.321 --> 03:56.236
- Me and the family

03:56.279 --> 03:59.500
used to swim out here
all the time,

03:59.543 --> 04:01.980
but now no one cares.

04:02.024 --> 04:04.069
Cool jump, lil' dude.

I'm gonna name you Jumpers.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.899
Mom, what is that?

04:07.943 --> 04:09.249
It's a frog.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.989
A frog?!
That's awesome!

04:11.033 --> 04:12.513
I'm coming out.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.384
Wait, there's a frog
by the pool?

04:14.428 --> 04:15.864
This I gotta see!

04:15.907 --> 04:18.736
I see it,

04:18.780 --> 04:21.304

04:22.392 --> 04:23.828
His name is Jumpers,

04:23.872 --> 04:26.440

by the pool.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.834
Jumpers, watch this!

04:31.096 --> 04:32.620
Jumpers, over here!

04:37.320 --> 04:39.931
Uh... come back to me.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.585
Jumpers,
look at this kick flip.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.676

05:11.746 --> 05:12.964
I wanted us to eat quick

05:13.008 --> 05:15.140
so we can get back out there
with Jumpers.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.926
Oh, yeah, cool.
I'll head out later.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.884
- Samesies.
- Yeah, I got tired again.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.060
And I'm still looking

05:22.104 --> 05:24.628

but I've lost them again.

05:36.161 --> 05:39.339

to get their attention.

05:39.382 --> 05:42.429
Oh, but what?

05:43.691 --> 05:44.866
Yes?

05:47.477 --> 05:50.088
Oh, you want me to follow you.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.521
I have no clue what I'm doing.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.218

to eat out here?

07:23.094 --> 07:24.922

07:24.966 --> 07:26.750
I won't demean myself
this way.

07:26.794 --> 07:30.624

11:22.725 --> 11:26.033
Did someone say tributary?

11:32.561 --> 11:36.870
Now nothing can come
between me and my family.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.176
Welcome back.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.004
Let's skip right to the end.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.702
Closing statements, go!

11:42.745 --> 11:47.315
Your Honor, it comes down
to the three Fs.

11:47.358 --> 11:50.797
Frogs, family, and Francine.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.713
If that's not the three Fs,
I don't know what is.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.802
Oh [bleep] right
in his [bleep] face.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.021
You want something
in your face, Your Honor?

11:58.065 --> 12:01.198
How about some
surprise witnesses!

12:02.373 --> 12:03.723
Whaaaat?

12:03.766 --> 12:05.812
It is crazy in here!

12:05.855 --> 12:08.466
They're testifying
against Francine?

12:08.510 --> 12:10.294
- That's--
- Perfidious.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.166
What the...?

12:12.209 --> 12:14.298
The frogs are loud.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.822
Things have gotten bad,

12:15.865 --> 12:17.301
and we're worried
they're going to get worse.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.739
What if I told you
I have an app where people

12:19.782 --> 12:23.046
such as yourself could meet
other people such as themselves?

12:23.090 --> 12:25.962
She tore down the kitchen wall
to let the frogs inside.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.399
She put 12 humidifiers
in my room.

12:28.443 --> 12:31.402
Order, order!
You already said something!

12:33.056 --> 12:35.755
It is with great thought
and consideration

12:35.798 --> 12:37.582
that I make this judgement.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.193
Francine wins!

12:39.236 --> 12:41.804
She can keep the frogs
and let those babies thrive.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.154
Really?

12:44.198 --> 12:45.852
Your ass is dismissed!

12:45.895 --> 12:47.767
And here's my ass.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.380
What?

12:52.423 --> 12:55.862
This isn't the last
you've heard of me, Francine.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.167
Mom, please don't be mad.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.823
They betrayed you, Francine.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.391
You betrayed me. Wait.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.262
- You can talk?
- Of course we can talk!

13:05.306 --> 13:06.786
But we couldn't get you
to listen.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.571
All you've done is listen.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.573
You constantly cater
to their needs.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.183
That's true!

13:13.227 --> 13:16.621
I thought I was doing
what was best for my family.

13:16.665 --> 13:19.842
We're your family now.
Exile them!

13:19.886 --> 13:22.584
Your Honor, I'd like
a restraining order

13:22.627 --> 13:24.368
against my family.

13:24.412 --> 13:27.067
Granted!

13:27.110 --> 13:29.069
She's incredible!

13:30.679 --> 13:32.812
Let's go, Jumpers.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.466
Wait, Francine,
can we still have sex?

13:35.510 --> 13:37.033
No.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.514
Okay, well, you're still
attracted to me right?

13:40.907 --> 13:42.299
Not as much.

13:42.343 --> 13:46.390
My new beta tester!

13:46.434 --> 13:48.305
Stan, I'm marking you down
as bisexual.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.698
Is that cool?

13:52.179 --> 13:55.660
I mean, it's not like
I own the word "perfidious."

13:55.704 --> 13:58.489
But Francine just said it
like it was hers.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.317
Mom's phone
isn't even ringing anymore.

14:03.494 --> 14:06.236
Your mother made her choice.
We're moving on.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.673
Moving on with a little help
from Barrel Scraper.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.588
Let me see what you wrote
for your profile.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.981
"My name is Stan.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.418
My wife doesn't find me
attractive anymore.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.681
Maybe you will like
my ugly face.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.988
Will you take care
of my kids?

14:19.032 --> 14:20.860
You must hate frogs."

14:20.903 --> 14:21.991
It's perfect.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.340
You got a match!

14:23.384 --> 14:25.299
I'll see if she wants
to meet up right now.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.867
I wish we could figure out
what's up with Jumpers.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.999
It's like Mom is under his spell
or something.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.087
I have an idea.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.654
Jeff, drive us to Groff.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.525
There's a herpetologist there
we can talk to.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.353
Ooh, I learned
this word recently.

14:36.397 --> 14:40.096
A herpetologist
studies reptiles and amphibians.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.532
Don't tell Francine, though.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.012
She'll be like

14:43.056 --> 14:44.535
herpetologist, herpetologist.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.668
Right, Jeff?

14:46.711 --> 14:49.889
Drop Stan off at Frog Ross
Restaurant for his first date.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.716
Frog Ross Restaurant?!

14:51.760 --> 14:53.544
You know frogs
remind me of her!

14:53.588 --> 14:56.025
Why?
Because of the frog thing?

15:01.204 --> 15:03.511
Jeff, will you hang with me
in the van?

15:03.554 --> 15:06.253
I want to keep talking
through my feelings.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.387
If these frogs
have moved into your house

15:10.431 --> 15:12.999
like you say,
then you're already too late.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.305
What do you mean?

15:15.349 --> 15:17.699
Oh, those aren't just
any normal frogs.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.919
They're the Brazilian
Cuckoo Frog.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.747
And they're extremely
danger--

15:22.791 --> 15:25.925
Sorry. My spit went down
the wrong pipe.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.449
They're extremely dangerous.

15:29.537 --> 15:30.930
This breed of frog

15:30.973 --> 15:33.497
follows a pack
of animals around

15:33.541 --> 15:35.935
like wolves follow bison

15:35.978 --> 15:39.590
to see if one of the pack
is trailing behind.

15:39.634 --> 15:42.593
Because usually if an animal
is trailing behind,

15:42.637 --> 15:46.467
it means they're being ignored
and isolated.

15:48.991 --> 15:52.995
The frogs surround this animal
and shower it with attention,

15:53.039 --> 15:56.259
time, even treats...

15:58.653 --> 16:01.961
...until the animal
is so entranced,

16:02.004 --> 16:06.530
that it leaves its own pack
and joins the frog army.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.011
Army is what a group of frogs
is called.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.970
Oh!

16:11.840 --> 16:14.451
Once the animal
is in the army,

16:14.495 --> 16:17.759
it will do anything
to protect the frogs.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.634
Package of lily pads
for Francine Smith.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.725
Ma'am, are you okay?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.989
I'm gonna call someone for you.
Ah!

16:30.032 --> 16:32.992
And the army
will do anything

16:33.035 --> 16:35.820
to keep the animal
for themselves.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.387
And then yada, yada, yada,

16:37.431 --> 16:39.476
the frogs make a foam nest
to lay their eggs in,

16:39.520 --> 16:42.740
and the animal offers herself up
to the newly hatched tadpoles,

16:42.784 --> 16:44.481
who devour her
from the inside out.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.135
Exsqueeze me?!

16:46.179 --> 16:48.442
We have to go save Mom
before she's eaten!

16:48.485 --> 16:50.748
- What's so funny?

16:50.792 --> 16:52.141
That exsqueeze me...

16:52.185 --> 16:54.230
just always gets me.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.147
And that's all there is
about me.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.019
That's the first thing
you've said.

17:00.845 --> 17:04.023
Hi.
I'm your waiter, Tipdip.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.633
Are you ready to order?

17:05.676 --> 17:08.070
Now, I haven't been on a date
in a very long time

17:08.114 --> 17:10.507
because I've been married
to the love of my life,

17:10.551 --> 17:13.119
but I do remember
that a woman thinks it's sexy

17:13.162 --> 17:14.859
when a man orders.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.340
She'll start with an alcoholic
Oreo milkshake,

17:17.384 --> 17:18.689
extra thick.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.778
For the entree,
the halibut linguine,

17:20.822 --> 17:23.346
but scratch the halibut
and make it a whole branzino,

17:23.390 --> 17:25.305
its eyes towards the lady.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.829
But not staring here,
because her eyes are up here.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.179
Right above
her beautiful breasts.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.269
- Hello?
- <i>Dad!</i>

17:33.313 --> 17:35.619
<i>Does Frog Ross still have
that big, mechanical frog?</i>

17:35.663 --> 17:38.100
<i>♪ Low ri-der♪</i>

17:43.236 --> 17:46.195
"Sorry we didn't continue
to love frogs."

17:46.239 --> 17:49.938
Psh. It's a start.
Bring it out back.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.725
Guessing that's
the foam nest.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.076
They're starting
to lay their eggs.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.512
We have to wait for Mom
to be asleep,

17:58.555 --> 17:59.948
or she'll fight us off.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.559
Good thing we're here in time

18:02.603 --> 18:04.735
for Mom's famous
lawn chair night nap.

18:07.521 --> 18:10.089
- Ahhh!
- Greg?!

18:10.132 --> 18:12.091
I'm here to kill
all the frogs!

18:12.134 --> 18:14.093
Starting with
this real big one!

18:14.136 --> 18:15.224
Ow!

18:17.270 --> 18:18.836
A Trojan frog?

18:18.880 --> 18:21.317
I should have known.
Where are the real frogs?

18:21.361 --> 18:22.536
In the foam!

18:22.927 --> 18:24.407
Aaah!

18:24.451 --> 18:25.843
Francine, come with us.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.541
These frogs
are going to eat you.

18:27.584 --> 18:31.110
I want them to.
Because they're my family.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.590
They're not your family,
we are!

18:33.634 --> 18:35.897
It is time.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.551
Adios.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.118
- Mom!
- Save her!

18:41.816 --> 18:43.426
Mom?

18:43.470 --> 18:44.558
Hello?

18:44.601 --> 18:46.386
Where is everyone?

18:46.429 --> 18:49.606
I feel so... isolated.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.786
Mom, I'm scared.

18:55.830 --> 18:59.268
I'm sorry if this is how alone
we made you feel.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.141
We should've swam
when you asked us to,

19:02.184 --> 19:04.230
after you worked so hard
on the pool.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.188
We shouldn't have needed
the frogs!

19:06.232 --> 19:07.972
We're sorry!

19:08.016 --> 19:09.539
Stan!
Was that you?

19:09.583 --> 19:12.020
What did you think
of the app's usability?

19:13.761 --> 19:15.328
Hi, little guy!

19:19.201 --> 19:21.421
Well, now
I'm a "tad" concerned.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.293
Funny right till the end.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.166
I'm so sorry!

19:27.209 --> 19:28.950
I don't know
what came over me.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.824
Francine, darling,
where are you going?

19:33.868 --> 19:35.652
The babies are hatching.

19:35.696 --> 19:38.481
I can't be your babies'
first meal.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.657
I have to be with my family.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.182
Is Mom talking to Jumpers?

19:43.225 --> 19:45.314
- Ribbit.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.403
Jumpers, what we had
was special--

19:47.447 --> 19:48.796
Cut the crap.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.494
I promised my family
the three Fs.

19:51.538 --> 19:55.019
Francine frog food.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.456
Greg's in there.
Eat him.

19:56.499 --> 20:00.024
Uh, no. He smells.
It's you we want.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.683
Eat me!

20:06.727 --> 20:08.511
It's been my life's dream

20:08.555 --> 20:12.298
to be the first human sacrifice
for the Brazilian Cuckoo Frog.

20:12.341 --> 20:15.257
I almost was once,
but my idiotic family saved me.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.740
This works.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.353
No! Ah, yes!

20:26.312 --> 20:29.576
Yes!

20:32.492 --> 20:36.496
Farewell, Francine.
It's been a pleasure.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.324
And to the rest
of the Smith family,

20:38.367 --> 20:40.500
ribbit, ribbit.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.153
Bye, Jumpers!

20:47.594 --> 20:51.250
Wow, look what just a little bit
of rest did for Greg.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.555
You all left me
with Klaus,

20:52.599 --> 20:55.254
you perfidious

20:56.298 --> 20:58.257
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
