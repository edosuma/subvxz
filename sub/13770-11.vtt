00:02.169 --> 00:03.879
Who's a big leaguer, huh?

00:03.921 --> 00:05.046
Who is it?

00:05.088 --> 00:06.966
Ooh!

00:07.007 --> 00:10.010
Hey, what an arm!

00:10.761 --> 00:13.263
Oh! You got me again.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.724
(both laugh)

00:15.766 --> 00:19.102
Bam! You really nailed me.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.941
He looked like

00:20.938 --> 00:23.941
he was enjoying it!

Morning.

01:03.731 --> 01:04.732
What are you hiding?

01:04.773 --> 01:05.900
What are you talking about?

01:05.941 --> 01:06.942
Stop wasting my time.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.527
I can smell the guilt from here.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.112
You know, if you fess up now,

01:08.569 --> 01:11.112
I might go easy on you.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.032
You can't just pretend

01:11.154 --> 01:13.032
to know something,

01:13.073 --> 01:14.575
hoping I'll blurt out

01:13.073 --> 01:14.575
a confession.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.993
I'm not hiding anything.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.622
Okay, I'm hiding something.

01:20.664 --> 01:21.707
Cool, huh?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.042
If I hide it from my parents

01:23.083 --> 01:24.585
for a month until it heals,

01:24.626 --> 01:27.046
then I can take it out

01:24.626 --> 01:27.046
and put it back anytime I want.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.547
And do you know why

01:27.086 --> 01:28.547
I did this?

01:28.589 --> 01:30.465
Me neither.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.135
Hey, that's really neat.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
Thanks. It's the

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
USS  Constitution.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.057
In 1803, it sailed all the...

01:38.097 --> 01:39.516
Typhoon!

01:39.558 --> 01:40.976
I can't believe you did that!

01:42.853 --> 01:44.063
How about now?

01:44.103 --> 01:45.146
You idiotic...!

01:45.773 --> 01:46.774
I hate you!

01:46.815 --> 01:48.149
I wish you weren't my brother!

01:48.191 --> 01:52.112
I wish you never existed!

01:54.197 --> 01:57.076
Wow. How did that happen?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.368
What?

01:58.410 --> 01:59.870
It's the most amazing thing

01:58.410 --> 01:59.870
I've ever seen.

01:59.912 --> 02:00.955
What is?

02:00.996 --> 02:02.414
I wished as hard as I could

02:02.456 --> 02:05.166
and Reese completely

02:02.456 --> 02:05.166
disappeared.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.460
Yeah, yeah, very funny.

02:06.501 --> 02:09.170
Huh. The smell is gone, too.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.548
I wonder if it works

02:09.212 --> 02:11.548
on other things.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.927
Nah. If this were gone,

02:11.590 --> 02:14.927
I'd miss it.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.227
(screams)

02:24.269 --> 02:26.229
You have your father's breasts.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.481
For God's sake,

02:26.271 --> 02:27.481
Mother,

02:27.522 --> 02:29.608
what are you doing here?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.819
A simple "hello"

02:29.650 --> 02:31.819
is asking too much?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.194
I'm sorry.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.447
You scared the living

02:33.236 --> 02:35.447
daylights out of me.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.573
I have news.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.075
Look, if Susan kicked you out,

02:38.117 --> 02:39.576
it doesn't mean

02:38.117 --> 02:39.576
you can stay here,

02:39.618 --> 02:41.036
because we just don't have

02:39.618 --> 02:41.036
the room.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.370
Not with the new baby and all.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.456
Oh, yes, another precious baby.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.084
You wouldn't want

02:44.498 --> 02:47.084
your welfare checks to dry up.

02:47.126 --> 02:49.878
I'm not moving in.

02:47.126 --> 02:49.878
I'm getting married.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.713
What?!

02:51.755 --> 02:54.008
His name is Mr. Li.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.217
I met him on my Alaska cruise.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.302
We're getting married tomorrow.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.806
You're getting married

02:59.096 --> 03:00.806
tomorrow?!

03:00.848 --> 03:02.683
At my age, if he has his teeth

03:02.724 --> 03:04.518
and is good in bed, why wait?

03:04.559 --> 03:05.226
(groans)

03:05.268 --> 03:06.812
Oh, I forgot.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.730
This one doesn't

03:06.854 --> 03:08.730
like girls.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.649
Grandma, I'm not gay.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.609
That's right.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.609
I'm just a liar.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.529
You'll be giving the rehearsal

03:12.651 --> 03:15.529
dinner here tonight.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.531
Tonight? Is Susan coming?

03:17.572 --> 03:21.076
No. Maybe next time

03:17.572 --> 03:21.076
your sister will think twice

03:21.118 --> 03:23.162
before she yells the answer

03:21.118 --> 03:23.162
to  Wheel of Fortune.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.245
Give someone else a chance.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.413
Wedding's at

03:24.287 --> 03:25.413
2:00 tomorrow.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.665
Don't be late.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.249
We have a 6:00 flight

03:26.707 --> 03:28.249
to Hong Kong.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.251
You're going to Hong Kong?

03:30.293 --> 03:32.253
Yes. He has a house

03:30.293 --> 03:32.253
there. That's where

03:30.293 --> 03:32.253
we're going to live.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.547
You're moving to China?

03:33.588 --> 03:35.174
I know.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.509
Chickens in the streets,

03:35.215 --> 03:37.509
children in the sweatshops,

03:37.551 --> 03:39.178
everyone smokes.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.888
It's a dream come true.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.182
It's just so sudden.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.266
I understand

03:43.223 --> 03:45.266
it is hard for you.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.311
I know how much

03:45.308 --> 03:48.311
you loved your father.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.314
Yes, that's probably it.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.276
Can you believe this?

03:55.318 --> 03:56.904
She'll be almost exactly

03:56.945 --> 03:58.572
on the other side

03:56.945 --> 03:58.572
of the Earth.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.115
We'll be separated from her

04:00.157 --> 04:02.283
by the entire molten core

04:00.157 --> 04:02.283
of a planet.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.703
It's like Christmas!

04:06.705 --> 04:10.291
Francis, I've done something

04:06.705 --> 04:10.291
wonderful for the hotel.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.128
(quietly):

04:10.333 --> 04:13.128
I hired an acting group

04:13.170 --> 04:17.007
to stage a murder-

04:13.170 --> 04:17.007
mystery weekend.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.341
Oh, dear God.

04:18.383 --> 04:21.136
The best part is, the

04:18.383 --> 04:21.136
actors will be checking in

04:21.178 --> 04:22.512
as regular guests.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.765
They could be

04:22.554 --> 04:24.765
among us right now

04:24.806 --> 04:26.558
and we would never know it.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.893
(man clears throat)

04:27.935 --> 04:29.477
(British accent):

04:27.935 --> 04:29.477
Attention, please!

04:29.519 --> 04:32.606
A room for Sir Reginald

04:29.519 --> 04:32.606
Drake and his vengeful,

04:32.647 --> 04:36.443
alcoholic wife, Evelyn.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.362
I don't have any clean socks,

04:37.611 --> 04:39.362
Dewey.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.781
Why don't you ask Reese?

04:40.822 --> 04:41.990
Who?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.909
Here, Dewey,

04:42.032 --> 04:43.909
put this on the table.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.202
What was that?

04:45.244 --> 04:46.369
Reese, for God's sake,

04:45.244 --> 04:46.369
pick it up!

04:46.411 --> 04:47.328
(doorbell rings)

04:47.370 --> 04:48.705
Oh, great.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.040
HAL:

04:48.747 --> 04:50.040
Honey, don't worry.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.625
Everything's going

04:50.082 --> 04:51.625
to be fine.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.169
Just relax and let's

04:51.666 --> 04:54.169
have a nice dinner.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.546
Ida's quite a catch!

04:57.380 --> 04:59.216
Hi, I'm Lois.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.216
This is Hal.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.425
Welcome to our home.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.343
MR. LI:

05:00.467 --> 05:02.343
Hello. Nice to meet you both.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.344
Get your coat?

05:03.386 --> 05:04.387
Stay away from me.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.931
Ooh. Strong and independent.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.016
Yet not so independent

05:05.973 --> 05:08.016
that she won't be

05:08.058 --> 05:09.810
a fully participating partner

05:08.058 --> 05:09.810
in your marriage.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.979
Shut up. You're blithering

05:09.851 --> 05:11.979
like an idiot.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.273
And delightfully honest.

05:14.314 --> 05:18.026
How can you be so callous,

05:14.314 --> 05:18.026
Cedric?!

05:19.278 --> 05:20.737
CEDRIC: I told you

05:19.278 --> 05:20.737
never to speak of that!

05:20.779 --> 05:25.867
Now quit these pointless

05:20.779 --> 05:25.867
hysterics and come to dinner!

05:27.452 --> 05:28.578
You'd best watch

05:28.620 --> 05:30.371
your step, Cedric.

05:30.413 --> 05:36.419
An old English hunting lodge

05:30.413 --> 05:36.419
can be a  very  dangerous place.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.546
Please, can't you get these

05:36.461 --> 05:38.546
morons out of here?

05:38.588 --> 05:40.590
I know.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.590
I'm very sorry.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.633
Just... try to ignore them.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.051
(gunshot)

05:43.093 --> 05:45.595
Alas, I am slain!

05:45.637 --> 05:47.848
Utterly slain!

05:48.515 --> 05:50.184
Who would have guessed

05:50.225 --> 05:53.854
that I would have been murdered

05:50.225 --> 05:53.854
by none other than...

05:53.895 --> 05:57.398
(grunting, groaning)

05:57.440 --> 05:58.859
(screaming with pain)

06:00.902 --> 06:02.403
That's it.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.403
We're checking out.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.404
No!

06:03.446 --> 06:05.406
Please, wait.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.909
Otto, you have

06:05.448 --> 06:07.909
to stop this.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.870
It's ruining

06:07.951 --> 06:09.870
everyone's time.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.872
Francis, try to be

06:09.911 --> 06:11.872
more understanding.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.832
They may be

06:11.913 --> 06:13.832
a little under-rehearsed,

06:13.874 --> 06:15.458
but they're working

06:13.874 --> 06:15.458
with us.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.419
They were completely open

06:15.500 --> 06:18.419
to cutting the musical numbers.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.421
Our guests are

06:18.461 --> 06:20.421
leaving in droves.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.632
We lost 12 in

06:20.463 --> 06:22.632
the last hour alone.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.012
I am not a big game hunter,

06:27.054 --> 06:31.390
I am actually

06:27.054 --> 06:31.390
a police inspector.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.436
Specialty... murder.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.647
I must insist

06:35.478 --> 06:37.647
that no one leave the room!

06:37.689 --> 06:39.858
Angela, I know things

06:37.689 --> 06:39.858
didn't go so well

06:39.900 --> 06:41.151
the last time,

06:41.193 --> 06:43.153
but I'm ready to try this again.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.612
Yes, Warren? Yes?

06:44.654 --> 06:47.824
We'll start our questioning

06:44.654 --> 06:47.824
with you, sir.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.286
If you've nothing to hide,

06:47.866 --> 06:51.286
you've nothing to fear!

06:51.328 --> 06:54.455
If you struggle, it'll only

06:51.328 --> 06:54.455
make it worse for you.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.457
Maybe I shouldn't

06:54.497 --> 06:56.457
have given him

06:56.499 --> 06:58.543
all the keys

06:56.499 --> 06:58.543
to the guest rooms.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.928
Dinner's going okay so far.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.470
Mr. Li seems nice.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.556
But my tongue is killing me.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.142
No one told me that putting

07:11.598 --> 07:14.142
a metal spike through it

07:14.184 --> 07:15.894
would be so uncomfortable.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.979
So, you two lovebirds met

07:15.936 --> 07:17.979
on a cruise.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.356
What was that like?

07:19.398 --> 07:21.482
What is this,

07:19.398 --> 07:21.482
the third degree?

07:21.524 --> 07:24.111
People meet.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.111
Happens every day.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.570
It's an interesting story.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.156
The woman I dined

07:25.612 --> 07:28.156
with the first night

07:28.198 --> 07:31.785
was confined to sickbay

07:28.198 --> 07:31.785
after she fell overboard.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.496
We had rough seas.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.374
LI:

07:35.538 --> 07:37.374
But as often happens,

07:37.416 --> 07:40.127
misfortune brings opportunity,

07:40.168 --> 07:44.505
for it was then

07:40.168 --> 07:44.505
I met the beautiful Ida.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.966
(chokes)

07:46.007 --> 07:48.218
Sorry. Swallowed a bug.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.428
Come on, Dewey.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.346
Have a dumpling.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.346
They're your favorite.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.098
And the only way

07:51.388 --> 07:53.098
you can get one

07:53.140 --> 07:54.599
is by taking it

07:53.140 --> 07:54.599
off this plate

07:54.641 --> 07:58.103
that I'm holding,

07:54.641 --> 07:58.103
which proves that I exist.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.022
If no one's eating

07:58.145 --> 08:01.022
this, I will.

08:01.064 --> 08:04.234
Mom, Jamie's got

08:01.064 --> 08:04.234
your cigarettes.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.693
Who the hell is Jamie?

08:05.735 --> 08:07.487
Your grandson.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.575
Huh. We never named them

08:12.617 --> 08:15.454
till we were sure

08:12.617 --> 08:15.454
they would survive.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.537
(chuckles)

08:16.579 --> 08:18.206
I love this dark humor of hers.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.540
I'm telling you,

08:19.582 --> 08:21.709
you have nothing but fun

08:19.582 --> 08:21.709
ahead of you.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.379
Reese, this firecracker shrimp

08:21.751 --> 08:24.379
is fantastic.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.007
Yes. I didn't know you can get

08:24.421 --> 08:27.007
such hot peppers in America.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.009
(groans)

08:29.050 --> 08:30.218
Something wrong?

08:31.970 --> 08:34.931
I just realized that

08:31.970 --> 08:34.931
Grandma's really leaving!

08:34.973 --> 08:36.433
I need to be alone.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.520
You should get him a woman

08:38.059 --> 08:40.520
before it's too late.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.481
An ugly one.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.691
They're cheaper,

08:42.563 --> 08:44.691
they work harder.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.488
It's okay.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.490
I'm sure I had yellow goo

08:49.529 --> 08:51.490
coming out of my tongue

08:51.531 --> 08:52.782
before it got pierced.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.575
Drink your tea.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.453
You hate it when

08:54.617 --> 08:56.453
it gets cold.

08:56.495 --> 08:59.414
Oh, darling, you have

08:56.495 --> 08:59.414
something in your hair.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.415
What?

09:00.457 --> 09:01.666
Under your wig.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.460
What are you doing?!

09:01.708 --> 09:03.460
Get out of there!

09:04.127 --> 09:05.462
What is this?

09:06.338 --> 09:07.630
A list of my bank accounts...

09:07.672 --> 09:09.466
and the amounts in them.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.555
I had to know what

09:12.427 --> 09:15.555
I was getting into.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.519
Wise as well as beautiful.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.769
If we are going

09:20.560 --> 09:21.769
to get married,

09:21.811 --> 09:25.606
it is only fair you know

09:21.811 --> 09:25.606
how much money I have.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.650
If you're done tearing

09:25.648 --> 09:27.650
at me like a hyena,

09:27.692 --> 09:29.610
I have to go fix myself.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.655
Thank you so very much

09:32.697 --> 09:34.615
for allowing me

09:32.697 --> 09:34.615
into your home.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.118
Put on your makeup

09:34.657 --> 09:37.118
somewhere else, Nancy!

09:37.160 --> 09:42.623
So, I am just

09:37.160 --> 09:42.623
so incredibly curious.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.460
You're in love with... my mom?

09:45.502 --> 09:48.296
I know it seems strange

09:45.502 --> 09:48.296
to people.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.466
I know that we are

09:48.338 --> 09:51.466
so very different.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.634
But ever since

09:51.508 --> 09:53.634
I met your mother,

09:53.676 --> 09:56.012
I've...

09:56.054 --> 09:58.390
She just makes me happy.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.475
I'm the happiest

10:00.517 --> 10:03.562
I've ever been in my whole life.

10:04.896 --> 10:09.359
And "happy" in your culture

10:04.896 --> 10:09.359
means the same as...?

10:10.693 --> 10:11.652
(knocking)

10:11.694 --> 10:14.489
MAN:

10:11.694 --> 10:14.489
It's open.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.656
Ah, gentlemen.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.825
I was expecting

10:15.698 --> 10:17.825
my fellow thespians.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.702
We're going to add

10:17.867 --> 10:19.702
a few delicious wrinkles

10:19.744 --> 10:21.496
to the plot tomorrow.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.664
Actually, that is what

10:21.538 --> 10:23.664
we wanted to talk to you about.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.874
Uh-uh-uh.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.667
If you think I'm going

10:24.916 --> 10:26.667
to give away the ending,

10:26.709 --> 10:27.668
you're sadly mistaken.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.087
Although...

10:29.129 --> 10:31.756
(old lady voice):

10:29.129 --> 10:31.756
I might pay particular attention

10:31.798 --> 10:34.717
to the enigmatic Mrs. Pomfreet.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.554
Otto...

10:34.759 --> 10:37.554
I'm sorry.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.554
We have to cancel the show.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.180
(Scottish accent):

10:37.596 --> 10:39.180
Or Lord McGregor,

10:39.222 --> 10:40.098
the gruff, but...

10:40.140 --> 10:41.682
What?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.684
You've all done a wonderful job,

10:43.726 --> 10:47.272
but we had a scheduling mix-up

10:43.726 --> 10:47.272
and you'll have to go.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.732
Thank you for the wonderful

10:47.314 --> 10:49.732
work you've done.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.151
Oh, God, please don't fire us!

10:51.192 --> 10:52.944
If we lose this job, it's over.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.322
There's no place lower

10:52.986 --> 10:55.322
in show business we can go.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.697
If you think

10:55.363 --> 10:56.697
I'm bad at this,

10:56.739 --> 10:58.950
you should have seen me

10:56.739 --> 10:58.950
at the Dairy Queen.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.368
This is our last chance.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.411
Please don't do this.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.704
Please.

11:03.746 --> 11:07.417
Please? Please?!

11:08.376 --> 11:09.669
Please?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.380
Please?

11:14.757 --> 11:16.717
Please?

11:16.759 --> 11:18.719
I can't believe

11:16.759 --> 11:18.719
you didn't fire them.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.721
I remember him

11:18.761 --> 11:20.721
from Dairy Queen.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.723
He  was  bad.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.228
Oh, no, no, no.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.729
LOIS: Malcolm,

11:27.270 --> 11:28.729
quit messing around in there

11:28.771 --> 11:29.772
and get out here.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.316
We're leaving

11:29.814 --> 11:31.316
for the wedding.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.442
I'll be out in a minute.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.734
(lisping):

11:32.484 --> 11:33.734
Hold your horses.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.735
What?

11:34.777 --> 11:35.736
Nothing.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.238
(lisping):

11:35.778 --> 11:37.238
Horses...

11:37.280 --> 11:40.367
Oh, my God, it's swollen

11:37.280 --> 11:40.367
so much, I can't say my S's.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.868
Mom's going to kill me.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.830
Wait. I can hide it.

11:45.872 --> 11:50.168
I'll be careful... how I talk.

11:50.210 --> 11:54.005
And avoid...

11:50.210 --> 11:54.005
that letter completely.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.715
(lisping):

11:54.047 --> 11:56.715
Simple.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.761
Well, looks like all

11:58.092 --> 12:00.761
of Ida's friends showed up.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.597
Let's hope this thing

12:00.803 --> 12:02.597
starts soon.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.058
Hey, Malcolm, what time

12:02.639 --> 12:05.058
does the parking lot close?

12:05.099 --> 12:06.643
6:00, 6:30, 7:00?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.728
Military time,

12:07.810 --> 12:09.728
that would be 1900, Dad.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.150
Ah, here's the

12:11.814 --> 12:14.150
blushing bride!

12:14.192 --> 12:16.777
I'm sorry, the hotel doesn't

12:14.192 --> 12:16.777
allow smoking in here.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.154
Back off, you cow.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.989
This is my special day.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.950
Hal, do you think...?

12:22.992 --> 12:24.785
Lois, I know it's weird,

12:22.992 --> 12:24.785
but love is blind

12:24.827 --> 12:27.038
and it's none of our business,

12:24.827 --> 12:27.038
so we might as well

12:27.080 --> 12:29.290
just let it go, wish them well,

12:27.080 --> 12:29.290
and move on.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.709
I know I have.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.629
Okay, I admit I've been

12:32.502 --> 12:34.629
a crummy brother,

12:34.671 --> 12:36.673
and I shouldn't have

12:34.671 --> 12:36.673
smashed your ship,

12:36.715 --> 12:39.634
and I probably should have

12:36.715 --> 12:39.634
tried out that new choke hold

12:39.676 --> 12:42.262
on an animal before

12:39.676 --> 12:42.262
using it on you.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.847
So, anyway,

12:42.303 --> 12:44.847
I got you this.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.308
Oh, wow!

12:47.350 --> 12:48.851
That's so cool.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.437
And you can play

12:48.893 --> 12:50.437
against the robots

12:50.478 --> 12:52.021
or you join them

12:50.478 --> 12:52.021
and fight the mutants.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.607
I've always wanted this game.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.191
I can't believe it.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.277
And there's a trick to skip

12:55.233 --> 12:57.277
levels. Here, let me show you...

12:57.318 --> 13:01.114
Mom, I just found the exact

12:57.318 --> 13:01.114
game I wanted for my birthday

13:01.155 --> 13:03.116
just lying on this chair.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.036
How can he be so insensitive?

13:09.038 --> 13:11.541
Jamie?

13:16.588 --> 13:18.339
LI:

13:16.588 --> 13:18.339
Ah, my love.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.716
I almost forgot--

13:19.758 --> 13:22.218
my grandmother wore

13:19.758 --> 13:22.218
this very necklace

13:22.260 --> 13:23.720
on her wedding day.

13:23.762 --> 13:24.845
It's called

13:24.887 --> 13:26.139
Shuang Hsi,

13:26.180 --> 13:29.476
the Chinese symbol

13:26.180 --> 13:29.476
for double happiness.

13:29.517 --> 13:33.438
White people aren't impressed

13:29.517 --> 13:33.438
with this junk.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.565
You're not supposed

13:33.480 --> 13:35.565
to see me before the wedding.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.857
Go back to your room

13:36.899 --> 13:38.817
before someone mistakes

13:36.899 --> 13:38.817
you for a waiter!

13:39.902 --> 13:42.071
Whatever my bride wants.

13:42.113 --> 13:45.158
I'll see you in a little while.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.503
Oh, my God.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.878
Opiate,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.880
opiate, mood elevator,

13:59.922 --> 14:02.717
large mammal tranquilizer...

14:02.759 --> 14:04.594
He's not in love

14:02.759 --> 14:04.594
with her at all.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.596
She's got him drugged!

14:12.185 --> 14:13.894
Skies are clear at the airport.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.605
No problem with

14:13.936 --> 14:15.605
their flight leaving.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.939
I'm checking the freeways.

14:16.981 --> 14:17.898
Dad, Mom,

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
I have to tell you...

14:19.942 --> 14:21.068
a thing.

14:21.110 --> 14:21.944
What?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.738
Grandma...

14:23.780 --> 14:25.406
be drugging...

14:25.448 --> 14:27.908
the man from China.

14:27.950 --> 14:28.951
What?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.911
Grandma be drugging

14:28.993 --> 14:30.911
the man from China.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.998
What the hell is this?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.958
Powerful mood elevator.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.335
A lot of them.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.170
Bottle after bottle

14:37.377 --> 14:39.170
after bottle.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.505
She's drugging him?

14:40.547 --> 14:41.922
How is she doing that?

14:41.964 --> 14:43.090
The tea.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.802
My God, of course,

14:43.132 --> 14:45.802
the tea!

14:45.844 --> 14:47.970
Remember, she kept

14:45.844 --> 14:47.970
refilling his cup all night.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.930
That's how I'd do it.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.975
You're sure that

14:49.972 --> 14:52.975
this is her purse?

14:53.017 --> 14:54.394
Ye...

14:54.435 --> 14:55.395
Affirmative.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.521
Oh, stop screwing around.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.480
Yes or no?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.440
Yes or no?!

14:59.482 --> 15:01.401
Not no.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.985
Stealing

15:03.027 --> 15:04.445
an old woman's purse.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.239
I should have you all arrested.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.158
Us? We know what you're doing

15:06.280 --> 15:09.158
to that poor Mr. Li.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.952
My God, I thought you were an

15:09.200 --> 15:11.952
evil, conniving monster before,

15:11.994 --> 15:14.414
but this, Mother,

15:11.994 --> 15:14.414
this is beyond the pale!

15:14.455 --> 15:15.956
HAL:

15:14.455 --> 15:15.956
He's a human being,

15:15.998 --> 15:17.792
and you're drugging him!

15:17.834 --> 15:19.252
It's called seduction.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.962
It's no different

15:19.293 --> 15:21.962
from wearing perfume

15:22.004 --> 15:24.758
or padding your bra

15:22.004 --> 15:24.758
with potatoes.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.427
What girl doesn't look

15:24.799 --> 15:27.427
for a little edge?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.387
You are out of your mind!

15:29.429 --> 15:30.805
Either you march up

15:30.847 --> 15:32.682
to his room and tell him

15:30.847 --> 15:32.682
this wedding is off

15:32.724 --> 15:34.058
or we're calling the police!

15:34.100 --> 15:37.978
All right, I'm going.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.021
Split the take?

15:39.063 --> 15:40.440
Mom, go!

15:42.400 --> 15:44.819
...and how could

15:42.400 --> 15:44.819
our murderer

15:44.861 --> 15:46.987
leave no footprints?

15:47.029 --> 15:50.825
Because I submit to you

15:50.867 --> 15:52.493
that he did not walk,

15:52.535 --> 15:54.454
but rather swung...

15:54.495 --> 15:58.082
into the room... on a rope!

15:58.124 --> 16:03.003
And the only

15:58.124 --> 16:03.003
former circus acrobat here is...

16:03.045 --> 16:04.422
That man!

16:05.047 --> 16:06.883
And... that woman!

16:06.925 --> 16:07.967
(gasps)

16:09.510 --> 16:11.512
Oh, Edward, the game's up.

16:11.554 --> 16:14.390
(Cockney accent):

16:11.554 --> 16:14.390
Yeah, we done it.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.268
And we'd do it again, Guv'ner.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.980
Mystery solved.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.902
Oh, bravo!

16:27.737 --> 16:29.614
Oh, my God.

16:29.656 --> 16:30.865
Did you feel that?

16:30.907 --> 16:32.032
It was wonderful!

16:32.074 --> 16:33.910
That was the best reaction

16:32.074 --> 16:33.910
we've ever had.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.035
Thank you so much.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.913
Thank you for giving us

16:35.077 --> 16:36.913
this chance.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.205
No need.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.040
The important thing is you

16:38.247 --> 16:40.040
believed in yourself

16:40.082 --> 16:41.876
and you did a great job.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.670
(stilted):

16:41.918 --> 16:43.670
What a delightful display

16:43.711 --> 16:45.546
of intrigue and whimsy.

16:46.589 --> 16:47.841
(reciting):

16:46.589 --> 16:47.841
I will remember this

16:47.882 --> 16:49.049
for years to come.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.177
I cannot wait

16:49.091 --> 16:51.177
to tell my friends.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.472
(chuckling)

16:54.514 --> 16:56.265
You hired the audience?

16:56.307 --> 16:58.768
I hated to see him

16:56.307 --> 16:58.768
so depressed.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.437
Within its framework

16:58.810 --> 17:01.437
of commitment and loyalty,

17:01.479 --> 17:05.065
marriage enables

17:01.479 --> 17:05.065
the establishment of a home...

17:05.107 --> 17:07.443
They look so

17:05.107 --> 17:07.443
nice together.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.236
Yeah, they do.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.322
I just love weddings.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.783
...with trust and patience,

17:11.364 --> 17:13.783
your love will grow stronger.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.702
Weren't we supposed

17:13.825 --> 17:15.702
to stop this?

17:15.743 --> 17:17.745
Hmm. I think you're right.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.079
I wonder why we didn't.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.331
Who cares?

17:20.373 --> 17:21.791
It's nice.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.459
Oh, I'm not

17:21.833 --> 17:23.459
worried about it.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.170
I... I'm just... happy.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.464
MINISTER: Your love and respect

17:26.212 --> 17:28.464
for each other,

17:28.506 --> 17:30.466
your trust and understanding

17:28.506 --> 17:30.466
of each other

17:30.508 --> 17:32.719
will increase

17:30.508 --> 17:32.719
your contentment...

17:32.760 --> 17:34.804
They're all empty.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.014
Every bottle.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.932
She drugged us all.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.643
That filthy,

17:37.974 --> 17:40.643
hateful monster.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.146
But how'd she do it?

17:44.188 --> 17:46.106
The buffet.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
Oh, that's right.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.820
It showed up right after

17:48.150 --> 17:50.820
she went to talk to Mr. Li.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.196
That evil genius.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.532
You know, she knew we couldn't

17:52.238 --> 17:54.532
pass up free food.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.784
This is simply the

17:54.574 --> 17:56.784
most diabolical,

17:56.826 --> 17:58.995
hateful thing

17:56.826 --> 17:58.995
she's ever done.

17:59.037 --> 18:02.289
But I sure do like

17:59.037 --> 18:02.289
her dress. Don't you?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.791
I agree.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.127
It's weird-- I used to

18:03.833 --> 18:07.127
just think thoughts.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.964
Now my thoughts

18:07.169 --> 18:09.964
are thinking thoughts.

18:10.006 --> 18:13.426
It's like, if I don't exist,

18:10.006 --> 18:13.426
who's saying if I don't exist?

18:13.467 --> 18:14.761
You know what I mean?

18:14.802 --> 18:17.931
I'll tell you who's saying it.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.390
Me.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.518
It's like I think, therefore...

18:22.560 --> 18:24.854
Oh, wait.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.313
I had it.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.608
Don't worry, Reese,

18:26.355 --> 18:28.608
it'll come back around.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.609
Yeah.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.403
Hey, you spoke to me.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.571
I exist.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.864
For now.

18:34.906 --> 18:35.990
MINISTER:

18:34.906 --> 18:35.990
...buds are yet to blossom

18:36.032 --> 18:37.157
and with care...

18:37.199 --> 18:38.785
You know, I have to admit,

18:38.826 --> 18:41.621
part of me wishes we could

18:38.826 --> 18:41.621
just stay this happy forever.

18:41.662 --> 18:45.165
Can we, Malcolm?

18:41.662 --> 18:45.165
Can we?

18:45.207 --> 18:46.375
Not really.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.252
(lisping):

18:46.417 --> 18:48.252
I mean, most of these drugs

18:48.294 --> 18:50.170
wear off

18:48.294 --> 18:50.170
after four or five hours.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.589
Malcolm, why

18:50.212 --> 18:51.589
are you lisping?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.424
I pierced my tongue.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.176
I've been hiding it because

18:53.466 --> 18:56.176
I knew you'd go psycho.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.345
I'll show you psycho.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.057
When we get home, I'm going

18:58.387 --> 19:01.057
to pull that thing out

19:01.099 --> 19:02.224
with a pair of pliers.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.184
Sounds fair.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.771
Be constant and consistent

19:04.226 --> 19:06.771
in your love.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.355
From this comes the knowledge

19:08.397 --> 19:11.275
that you can

19:08.397 --> 19:11.275
weather any storm...

19:11.317 --> 19:13.193
Did you drink your tea?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.112
What tea?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.113
The tea I gave you

19:15.154 --> 19:16.238
right before the ceremony.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.573
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:17.615 --> 19:20.076
I thought that was for me.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.202
Did anyone ever tell you,

19:22.244 --> 19:25.205
you have a beautiful smile?

19:25.247 --> 19:26.874
I haven't been

19:25.247 --> 19:26.874
to the dentist in years.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.375
I should really

19:26.916 --> 19:28.375
give him a call...

19:28.417 --> 19:30.210
Get on with it, God boy!

19:30.252 --> 19:33.923
Well, someone's eager for the

19:30.252 --> 19:33.923
sacrament of married love, huh?

19:33.965 --> 19:35.215
(chuckling)

19:35.257 --> 19:37.010
I think Mr. Li's

19:35.257 --> 19:37.010
coming out of it.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.260
Ah, what a shame.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.680
The old bat used up

19:38.302 --> 19:40.680
all her happy pills on us.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.056
Oh, also,

19:42.098 --> 19:45.267
this is so very, very,

19:42.098 --> 19:45.267
very important.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.894
Never go to bed angry.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.605
I should say,

19:46.936 --> 19:49.605
never go to sleep angry.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.482
(laughs)

19:51.524 --> 19:53.442
And you know what?

19:53.484 --> 19:54.694
Never eat salad angry.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.154
Never eat soup sad.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.905
Give me these.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.115
Here.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.240
Go.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.492
Shall we pray...?

20:00.282 --> 20:01.492
No!

20:01.534 --> 20:03.243
All righty then.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.243
Do you take...?

20:03.285 --> 20:04.162
Yes!

20:04.203 --> 20:05.245
And do you...?

20:05.287 --> 20:06.246
Yes!

20:06.288 --> 20:07.707
Then I now pronounce you...

20:07.748 --> 20:09.291
Who the hell are you?

20:10.501 --> 20:12.503
Oh, darling, don't be silly.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.838
Get the rings!

20:13.880 --> 20:16.256
Wait, I know you.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.425
You're that horrible woman

20:16.298 --> 20:18.425
at my table

20:18.467 --> 20:20.260
who kept spitting

20:18.467 --> 20:20.260
at the busboys.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.262
Oh, no, no.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.262
That was someone else.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.347
No, it was you!

20:23.389 --> 20:24.515
My little honey lamb.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.266
Let me go!

20:24.557 --> 20:26.266
Hoochie-coochie.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.935
(Li speaking Cantonese)

20:27.977 --> 20:29.311
Ow! Ooh!

20:29.353 --> 20:30.312
Ooh!

20:30.354 --> 20:31.438
You take your...

20:31.480 --> 20:33.315
take your hands

20:31.480 --> 20:33.315
off of me!

20:33.357 --> 20:36.694
You can't leave me now!

20:36.736 --> 20:39.072
I'm pregnant! Oh!

20:39.113 --> 20:41.281
(sobbing)

20:41.323 --> 20:43.283
Why, why?!

20:43.325 --> 20:46.579
Why can't I ever be happy?!

20:46.620 --> 20:47.914
(crying)

20:47.955 --> 20:51.417
I promised I wasn't

20:47.955 --> 20:51.417
going to do this.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.003
There's still dirt

20:52.585 --> 20:54.003
under the rim.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.379
I've been scrubbing

20:54.045 --> 20:55.379
for an hour.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.964
It's not coming off.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.966
Well, since you don't care

20:57.006 --> 20:58.966
about your tongue,

20:59.008 --> 21:01.177
maybe you could use that

20:59.008 --> 21:01.177
to clean the toilet.

21:01.219 --> 21:02.595
I found Grandma's thermos.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.224
Looks like there's still

21:04.388 --> 21:06.224
a half cup left

21:06.265 --> 21:07.307
of this terrible potion.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.018
You know, the lawnmower

21:07.349 --> 21:09.018
needs some work.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.062
I think I'll go out

21:09.060 --> 21:11.062
to the garage...

21:14.398 --> 21:16.316
Good. Yeah, good idea.
