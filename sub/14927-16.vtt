00:54.222 --> 00:55.856
TO SHOW THAT
HE'S AN OPEN-MINDED,

00:55.889 --> 00:58.592

08:40.053 --> 08:42.289

WHY ME?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.191
WELL, IT WAS BACK
IN THE EIGHTIES.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.194
I HAD LEGITIMATE
CONCERNS.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.067
EDWIN, STOP
STEALING MY SHIRTS.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.969
I'M JUST

08:56.003 --> 08:58.972
YEAH, BUT YOU KEEP GETTIN'
YOUR LIPSTICK ON 'EM.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.776

YOUR MOTHER THINK
I'VE BEEN OUT TOM-CATTIN'.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.116
COME ON, DAD. YOU'VE
NEVER EXPERIMENTED

09:09.149 --> 09:13.053
WELL, SURE.
I WORE LIPSTICK

09:13.086 --> 09:14.855

09:49.723 --> 09:50.624
Eddie: MY DAD.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.159

09:52.192 --> 09:56.196
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I--I BROUGHT YOU
A BOX OF PENS.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.667
OH, THAT'S, UH,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.203
YEAH, CAN I GET

10:03.236 --> 10:05.906
WE'RE--WE'RE OUT.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.309
OH, UH, CAN YOU MAKE
A TEQUILA SLAMMER?

10:09.342 --> 10:10.243
NO.

10:10.277 --> 10:14.147
THIS ISN'T REALLY
A HIGHBROW
ESTABLISHMENT.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.717
WELL, FINE.
I'LL GET A FUZZY NAVEL.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.350

10:18.185 --> 10:20.821
YEAH, I'LL SEE WHAT
YOU CAN DO, TOO.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.793
HAVE I GOT ON
TOO MUCH COLOGNE?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.127
AW, DAD,
YOU'RE FINE.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.261
YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T WANNA

10:28.295 --> 10:31.198
GIVE THIS GAY FELLA
ANY FALSE HOPES.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.432
YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT

10:32.465 --> 10:36.336
BEFORE YOU GREW
THAT BIG FLAVOR-SAVER
OF A MUSTACHE, DADDY.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.173
I'M KIDDIN'.
HE'S JUST A REGULAR GUY.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.809
WELL, YOU SHOULD
NEVER HAVE BEEN PUT

10:41.842 --> 10:43.110
IN THIS SITUATION,
SEAN.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.146
YEAH, THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD
A SIGN OUTSIDE THAT PLACE

10:46.179 --> 10:49.316
THAT SAID, "YOU MUST
BE THIS GAY TO GET IN."

10:49.349 --> 10:51.218
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.686
THEY'VE GOT
TOO MANY "DAYS"

10:52.720 --> 10:53.754
AT ACTION MOUNTAIN
ANYWAY.

10:53.787 --> 10:57.290
I THOUGHT YOU
LEARNED YOUR LESSON
LAST HALLOWEEN.

10:57.958 --> 11:02.362
OH, OH, OH, OH...

11:04.264 --> 11:07.334
AAH!

11:07.367 --> 11:09.669
OH!

11:10.303 --> 11:11.471
HELP ME!

11:11.504 --> 11:13.073
HELP!

11:13.106 --> 11:18.211
YOU CAN REST IN PEACE
ONCE I SAW YOUR HEAD OFF.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.914
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

11:20.948 --> 11:24.284
THERE'S NO CHAIN
ON YOUR CHAIN SAW.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.221
SOUNDS A LOT LESS
SCARED OF ZOMBIES

11:28.255 --> 11:29.757
THAN HE IS OF GAY PEOPLE.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.225
OH, I'M NOT SCARED
OF GAY PEOPLE.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.894
I LOVE GAY PEOPLE.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.062
YES, YES, I KNOW.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.396
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING
DINNER, RIGHT?

11:36.429 --> 11:37.197
YOU'RE GONNA SHOW US.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.166
THAT'S NOT WHAT
TONIGHT'S ALL ABOUT.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.100
THEN WHY ARE
WE DOING THIS?

11:40.133 --> 11:42.435
WELL, BECAUSE THE DAY
AFTER ACTION MOUNTAIN,

11:42.469 --> 11:45.172
OK, SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO PAUL AT WORK.

11:45.205 --> 11:45.873
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:45.906 --> 11:48.175
WELL, THERE WAS...
AN ACCIDENT.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.276
WHAT KIND
OF ACCIDENT?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.510
WELL, IT WAS JUST
ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT HAPPENED,

11:50.543 --> 11:51.879
AND THERE'S
NOTHING--

11:51.912 --> 11:53.947
OH, JUST

11:55.248 --> 11:58.251
I TOLD EVERYONE
HE WAS GAY.

12:02.022 --> 12:02.956
YOU OUTED PAUL?
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.057
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.092
I DIDN'T MEAN TO, BABY.

12:05.125 --> 12:05.926
THE GUYS, THEY JUST--

12:05.959 --> 12:09.129
THEY--THEY--THEY
DRAGGED IT OUT OF ME.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.530
WHAT'S THAT?

12:10.563 --> 12:11.799
IT'S A CROISSANT.

12:11.832 --> 12:12.732
A CROISSANT...

12:12.766 --> 12:14.501
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND,
HE PACKED THAT FOR YOU?

12:14.534 --> 12:16.103
OH, GOD. HEY, GUYS,

12:16.136 --> 12:18.371
CAN WE EASE UP
ON THE GAY STUFF
JUST A LITTLE?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.040
WHY SO SENSITIVE,
FINNERTY?

12:20.073 --> 12:20.874
ARE YOU GAY?

12:20.908 --> 12:24.845
I'M NOT GAY, OK,
BUT SOMEBODY COULD BE.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.046
SO WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING, FINNERTY?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.180
IS SOMEBODY
HERE GAY?

12:27.214 --> 12:30.550
UH, THAT--THAT'S
NOT THE POINT.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.120
HEY, DO YOU
KNOW SOMETHIN'?

12:33.153 --> 12:33.954
NO.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.989
HA.
IS IT DINO?

12:36.023 --> 12:37.090
NO, IT'S NOT DINO.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.025
I KNEW IT.
IT'S TELLY.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.894
IT'S NOT TELLY,
ALL RIGHT?
JUST LET IT GO.

12:40.928 --> 12:41.561
IS IT PAUL?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.463
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO IT IS.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.066
Both: IT'S PAUL.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.268
HEY, I'M NOT SAYIN'
PAUL'S GAY.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.070
OH, YOU JUST DID.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.039
WELL, EVEN IF HE IS,
IS IT REALLY SO FUNNY

12:52.072 --> 12:54.507
TO JOKE ABOUT HIS
LIFESTYLE CHOICE?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.343
HEY, TELLY!

12:56.376 --> 12:59.312
DID YA HEAR?
PAUL'S GAY!

13:01.014 --> 13:03.383
YOU ARE UNREAL.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.151

13:04.184 --> 13:05.919
I MEAN, THESE GUYS,
THEY'RE JUST--

13:05.953 --> 13:08.956
THEY'RE MASTERS
OF DEDUCTION.

13:09.589 --> 13:10.958
OH, YEAH. YEAH,
THEY'RE GENIUSES.

13:10.991 --> 13:16.296
GOD, I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
PAUL EVEN AGREED TO COME
AFTER WHAT YOU DID.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.166
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.267
I GOTTA TELL HIM.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.502
AH, HA HA.
HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH?

13:22.535 --> 13:23.503
NO, BABY. HE'S GOTTA
HEAR IT FROM ME

13:23.536 --> 13:25.272
BEFORE HE HEARS IT
FROM THE GUYS
AT THE TUNNEL.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.139
I MEAN,

13:27.007 --> 13:29.376
THEY'RE NOT
UNDERSTANDING
LIKE I AM.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.944
OH, MY GOD. WHAT--

13:30.978 --> 13:33.280
WHAT, DO YOU TELL HIM,

13:33.313 --> 13:36.850
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED
YOUR HELP, OK,

13:36.884 --> 13:40.520
'CAUSE EVERYTHING IS

IT'S THE WORST.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.207

IT'S JUST--IT'S A VERY
BAD THING TO BE CALLED.

14:37.110 --> 14:37.945

14:37.978 --> 14:41.514
WELL, IT'S HARD
TO EXPLAIN. IT'S JUST...

14:41.548 --> 14:43.516
