00:00.062 --> 00:01.463
<i>Back in the '90s,</i>

00:01.554 --> 00:02.921
<i>making the Earth a greener place</i>

00:03.008 --> 00:04.474
<i>was on everyone's mind.</i>

00:04.576 --> 00:07.583
<i>From Earth Day celebrations
to "Save the Whale" protests,</i>

00:07.630 --> 00:09.495
<i>environmental awareness was everywhere,</i>

00:09.586 --> 00:12.041
<i>even movies and TV.</i>

00:12.120 --> 00:14.479
<i>And this had a profound effect
on Principal Glascott.</i>

00:14.557 --> 00:16.846
Last night, I saw an incredible film

00:16.916 --> 00:18.816
that shook me to my very core.

00:18.918 --> 00:21.185
"Waterworld"? I heard that movie sucked.

00:21.253 --> 00:23.620
- That's weird, 'cause I heard you suck!
- Hey!

00:23.689 --> 00:25.789
I'm sorry,
but we have to save the planet

00:25.858 --> 00:27.891
before global warming melts the ice caps

00:27.960 --> 00:30.427
and we're all living in
a bleak, waterlogged world

00:30.496 --> 00:32.100
where fresh dirt is currency!

00:32.177 --> 00:33.764
- Sounds like Tampa.
- If you ask me,

00:33.833 --> 00:35.132
the most accurate portrayal

00:35.201 --> 00:36.567
of not respecting our environment

00:36.635 --> 00:39.311
is the adorable animated gem
"FernGully."

00:39.372 --> 00:41.205
- Oh, God.
- What?

00:41.273 --> 00:42.339
And when you got to the theater,

00:42.441 --> 00:43.612
where'd you park your Big Wheel?

00:43.676 --> 00:45.042
Yeah, I'm not a child, Rick.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.744
I Rollerbladed there, so...

00:46.812 --> 00:48.645
Look, all I ask is
that we all do our part

00:48.748 --> 00:49.790
to save Mother Earth.

00:49.815 --> 00:50.881
I've done my part.

00:50.950 --> 00:52.783
In high school, I recycled
the same essay six times.

00:52.885 --> 00:54.752
Instead of focusing
on the bleak darkness

00:54.820 --> 00:57.721
of John Glascott's future soggy Earth,

00:57.790 --> 00:59.723
how about we linger
on the present brightness

00:59.825 --> 01:01.358
of Rick Mellor's...

01:01.427 --> 01:03.827
- new baseball stadium?
- Whoa!

01:03.929 --> 01:05.596
After six long years of waiting,

01:05.698 --> 01:07.331
we are finally ready to break ground.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.665
Is that a little Orange Julius stand?

01:08.734 --> 01:10.701
Well, I see no one else
is concerned about

01:10.803 --> 01:12.102
the plight of the planet,

01:12.171 --> 01:15.873
so, once again, it's up to
John Glascott, eco-warrior,

01:15.941 --> 01:18.042
to save our precious Mother Earth

01:18.144 --> 01:19.710
by his own damn self.

01:19.812 --> 01:22.212
John, uh, you left your car
running in the parking lot again.

01:22.281 --> 01:25.036
Dammit, Coop! Your timing sucks!

01:25.474 --> 01:28.285
<i>♪ One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here ♪</i>

01:28.387 --> 01:31.255
<i>♪ Live your life and finally be free ♪</i>

01:31.357 --> 01:34.224
<i>♪ Go where you wanna go,
do what you wanna do ♪</i>

01:34.326 --> 01:37.878
<i>♪ Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" ♪</i>

01:37.925 --> 01:40.230
<i>It was April 22nd, 1990-something,</i>

01:40.332 --> 01:42.166
<i>and all the students
were gearing up for the day</i>

01:42.234 --> 01:44.234
<i>that would make or break
any high school yearbook...</i>

01:44.336 --> 01:46.203
<i>the Senior Superlatives.</i>

01:46.305 --> 01:48.572
I can't wait.
I want to win "Best Smile"!

01:48.666 --> 01:50.929
It'll make five years
of picking roast beef

01:50.992 --> 01:52.328
out of my braces worth it.

01:52.411 --> 01:53.811
Come on.

01:55.815 --> 01:56.847
Ms. Howell?

01:57.850 --> 01:59.450
Oh, crap, Anna,

01:59.552 --> 02:01.118
I didn't know anyone was still here.

02:01.220 --> 02:02.453
Did you need something?

02:02.555 --> 02:04.354
I'm a little worried
about the superlatives.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.956
I-I don't want to get "Most Quiet."

02:06.058 --> 02:07.291
Huh? What?

02:07.393 --> 02:08.792
"Most Quiet"?

02:08.894 --> 02:10.360
I don't even know why
we have these things.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.882
It makes everyone feel bad.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.382
It's like, "Everyone, here I am,
the shy girl.

02:14.444 --> 02:15.944
Come look at the shy girl.

02:16.023 --> 02:17.406
Hey."

02:17.476 --> 02:19.503
I hear you... barely.

02:19.605 --> 02:20.904
But I'll tell you what.

02:21.006 --> 02:22.072
Ms. Lewis is heading up

02:22.174 --> 02:23.307
the Yearbook Committee this year.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.948
I'll have a little chat
with her, see what we can do.

02:25.029 --> 02:27.229
- Thanks, Ms. Howell.
- Not a problem.

02:27.300 --> 02:28.879
That's what teachers are here for.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.316
Now, where did she go?

02:32.418 --> 02:33.584
That girl needs to wear corduroys

02:33.686 --> 02:34.818
or a bell or something.

02:37.156 --> 02:38.655
Lainey...

02:38.757 --> 02:40.257
you gotta cut the Senior Superlatives.

02:40.359 --> 02:41.658
They're outdated and petty

02:41.760 --> 02:43.961
and, quite frankly,
"Waterworld"-level stupid.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.095
No way!

02:45.197 --> 02:46.230
The students love them.
And they're so much fun.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.664
Not for everyone.

02:47.766 --> 02:49.733
Anna Whitman's so terrified
she's gonna get "Most Quiet,"

02:49.835 --> 02:50.934
she spoke up to the point

02:51.036 --> 02:52.536
that I actually could hear her.

02:52.638 --> 02:54.204
Superlatives are a school tradition

02:54.306 --> 02:55.506
that have been awarded in the yearbook

02:55.608 --> 02:57.007
since 1890-something.

02:57.109 --> 03:00.895
Look, "Finest Bonnet,"
"Chastest Couple"...

03:00.981 --> 03:02.779
- Hmm.
- ..."Most Comely Ankles."

03:02.880 --> 03:04.351
Oh, wow, she really is blessed

03:04.419 --> 03:05.747
with quite the pair of foot-toppers.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.251
Sure, but how do you think

03:07.353 --> 03:09.653
"Least Likely to Survive
the Winter" felt?

03:09.755 --> 03:10.888
Sufficiently warned.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.890
Come on, Wilma, the kids have
looked forward to this.

03:12.992 --> 03:14.525
Spoken like someone who probably won

03:14.593 --> 03:16.293
"Best Dressed," maybe "Cutest."

03:16.395 --> 03:17.961
Or was it "Most Amazing Person

03:18.030 --> 03:19.429
Everyone Wants to Be Friends With"?

03:19.532 --> 03:20.785
Oh, stop. It was just the first two.

03:20.863 --> 03:21.865
The last one's ridiculous.

03:21.967 --> 03:24.535
Wait, why are there teachers'
names on this ballot?

03:24.603 --> 03:25.802
This year,
the Yearbook Committee decided

03:25.871 --> 03:27.793
it would be cool to add in
Teacher Superlatives.

03:27.863 --> 03:29.339
Yearbook Committee, huh?

03:29.408 --> 03:30.440
You had nothing to do with it?

03:30.543 --> 03:31.708
Oh, no, it was totally my idea.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.277
<i>While I was defending old traditions,</i>

03:33.379 --> 03:35.646
<i>Mellor and CB were ready
to start a new day.</i>

03:35.714 --> 03:37.314
Fancy restaurant leftovers

03:37.416 --> 03:40.150
or actual miniature swan
wrapped in foil?

03:40.219 --> 03:42.286
It's leftovers from my date last night.

03:42.354 --> 03:44.886
She, um... She dipped out
right before dessert,

03:44.933 --> 03:47.339
said she had to go put money in the
meters, but there were no meters.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.293
- And I drove.
- I think I know what the problem is.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.429
You say you drove last night?

03:52.498 --> 03:53.931
A gentleman always drives.

03:53.999 --> 03:56.300
Does a gentleman always
"Brake for Velociraptors"?

03:56.368 --> 03:58.001
Should have picked her up
in your other car...

03:58.103 --> 03:59.116
The Batmobile.

03:59.205 --> 04:01.138
A car says a lot about a man, CB,

04:01.240 --> 04:03.273
and yours says, "I'm 14."

04:06.979 --> 04:09.213
- Hacky Sacks.
- Mm-hmm.

04:09.315 --> 04:10.447
Comic books.

04:10.549 --> 04:11.615
Yeah.

04:11.684 --> 04:13.083
Magic linking rings.

04:13.185 --> 04:14.251
Yeah.

04:14.353 --> 04:16.687
Not to mention
an elderly frog in a bathrobe.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.322
Yoda, you know not?

04:18.423 --> 04:20.015
Did you speak to your date
like that last night?

04:20.093 --> 04:22.187
No. Although,
when the waiter came, I said,

04:22.249 --> 04:23.961
"Start us off with drinks, you can."

04:25.064 --> 04:26.730
Okay, this is a complete teardown.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.999
Some advice... when you
first start dating a woman,

04:29.101 --> 04:31.501
maybe hide yourself a bit.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.804
And don't overload her
with all your eccentricities.

04:33.906 --> 04:34.972
It'll freak her out.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.840
Lying about who I am seems wrong.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.016
I'm not asking you to lie,

04:38.086 --> 04:40.877
but maybe don't flaunt it
right out of the gate.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.587
Yeah, because what I've been doing
hasn't been working.

04:42.665 --> 04:44.688
- No.
- So I could try something like that.

04:44.750 --> 04:45.849
What do I talk about?

04:45.918 --> 04:47.317
Whatever she's into.

04:47.386 --> 04:48.919
And then go all-in on that.

04:49.021 --> 04:50.420
Oh, I see.

04:50.522 --> 04:51.622
But what if she's into Yoda?

04:51.717 --> 04:53.183
100% she's not.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.559
- But you never even met her.
- 100%.

04:57.162 --> 04:59.396
<i>Mellor had given CB some dating advice.</i>

04:59.498 --> 05:00.530
<i>And little did he know,</i>

05:00.633 --> 05:01.999
<i>he was about to put it to the test.</i>

05:02.101 --> 05:03.533
Hey, Rick, CB,

05:03.636 --> 05:05.402
I'd like for you to meet Paloma.

05:05.504 --> 05:07.404
She is an eco-consultant that I hired

05:07.506 --> 05:08.572
to help turn William Penn

05:08.641 --> 05:10.407
into the school that saved the planet.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.542
That's the goal,
through recycling, composting,

05:12.645 --> 05:14.011
and reducing waste.

05:14.079 --> 05:16.113
Actually, she's looking for
a green captain...

05:16.215 --> 05:17.281
someone to work side-by...

05:17.349 --> 05:19.683
CB can do it.
CB loves himself some Earth.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.251
Great. Glad to have you on board.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.654
It's always nice to have
a fellow eco-warrior at my side.

05:23.722 --> 05:25.822
Hey, that's me... eco-warrior CB.

05:25.924 --> 05:27.291
So, go, environment.

05:27.393 --> 05:29.126
Whoo! Gotta love that Earth!

05:29.194 --> 05:31.194
- Yeah, [bleep] pollution.
- Whoa!

05:31.263 --> 05:32.296
No, it's okay. He's right.

05:32.364 --> 05:33.797
That's pretty much my company's slogan.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.332
Let me show you the lunch room.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.335
<i>As CB took a first step with Paloma,</i>

05:38.437 --> 05:40.237
<i>Wilma was taking steps to protect Anna.</i>

05:45.144 --> 05:46.176
<i>¿Qué pasa?</i>

05:46.278 --> 05:47.944
Dammit, Coop!
Why are you sneaking around?

05:48.047 --> 05:49.179
I'm not sneaking.

05:49.214 --> 05:51.048
I'm still cleaning up
after my AP Spanish Taco Party.

05:51.116 --> 05:52.049
What you doin'?

05:52.117 --> 05:53.383
I'm trying to protect a child

05:53.452 --> 05:55.619
from the cruel, cruel world
of yearbook superlatives.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.155
Step aside. All right.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.490
Looks like you've done this a lot.

06:00.592 --> 06:01.858
Oh, yeah, my kids are constantly

06:01.960 --> 06:03.660
locking themselves
in bathrooms, bedrooms...

06:03.729 --> 06:05.329
basically, any room with a door.

06:05.397 --> 06:07.631
I'm thinking about
going doorless... or kidless.

06:07.733 --> 06:08.932
Ah.

06:09.034 --> 06:09.900
Okay.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.601
- Yes!
- All right.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.370
So, what exactly is the plan here?

06:13.472 --> 06:15.205
Well, if Anna won "Most Quiet,"

06:15.307 --> 06:16.540
I'm gonna fudge the results

06:16.642 --> 06:18.642
and swap her out for Phil Jones.

06:18.744 --> 06:21.011
Oh, Phil. Sweet kid.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.312
Had him in Spanish last year.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.947
No, you didn't. He doesn't exist.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.415
Made-up name just vague enough

06:25.484 --> 06:26.783
to sound like it's actually someone.

06:26.852 --> 06:28.585
- Okay.
- Oh, good. She didn't win.

06:28.687 --> 06:30.153
Oh. You know who did win?

06:30.222 --> 06:31.588
You, for "Coolest Teacher."

06:31.657 --> 06:33.156
Oh, my God, is this a joke?

06:33.225 --> 06:34.891
Kids can be so mean!

06:34.960 --> 06:36.093
Mean? What are you talking about?

06:36.161 --> 06:37.728
All the kids in my class
think you're very cool.

06:37.796 --> 06:39.196
- No way!
- Yeah.

06:39.298 --> 06:40.864
Well, I guess I am kinda cool.

06:40.966 --> 06:42.199
And what makes me even cooler

06:42.301 --> 06:43.633
is I never thought I'd be cool.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.202
Don't use that
in your acceptance speech.

06:45.270 --> 06:47.270
<i>Wilma had completed her mission.</i>

06:47.339 --> 06:48.352
<i>And the next morning,</i>

06:48.399 --> 06:50.140
<i>CB was on a mission to impress Paloma</i>

06:50.242 --> 06:52.843
<i>by exaggerating how much of
an eco-warrior he was.</i>

06:52.911 --> 06:54.378
It's so great to have a Green Captain

06:54.480 --> 06:55.679
who really walks the walk.

06:55.781 --> 06:58.248
Yeah, I've been a green guy
for the longest time.

06:58.350 --> 06:59.422
I remember what did it for me.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.085
I was on vacation scuba diving
with my family.

07:02.187 --> 07:03.820
And I saw this poor sea turtle

07:03.889 --> 07:05.555
tangled up in plastic six-pack rings,

07:05.657 --> 07:07.090
and that was that.

07:07.159 --> 07:08.625
So, what did it for you?

07:08.727 --> 07:10.794
Oh, gosh. There's just been so many.

07:10.863 --> 07:14.231
I think a big one was
when I went to Alaska

07:14.299 --> 07:16.166
and there was this big oil company

07:16.235 --> 07:18.034
that wanted to drill on native land.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.237
So an Inuit woman and I

07:20.305 --> 07:22.472
actually rallied the locals
to fend them off.

07:22.574 --> 07:23.940
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

07:24.009 --> 07:26.276
You know,
that actually sounds a lot like

07:26.378 --> 07:29.112
that Steven Seagal movie
"On Deadly Ground."

07:29.214 --> 07:31.615
Yeah, it's a pretty universal story.

07:31.717 --> 07:33.216
Hey, CB, here's the copy
of "Infinity Gauntlet"

07:33.266 --> 07:34.217
you asked to borrow.

07:34.286 --> 07:35.552
I never asked to borrow a comic.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.120
Yeah, you called me last night.

07:37.189 --> 07:38.989
- You woke up my entire house.
- I did.

07:39.057 --> 07:41.491
So that you remembered to recycle.

07:41.593 --> 07:44.428
So, good... job.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.962
Um, I'll give you $5 later.

07:46.031 --> 07:47.230
Just go along with it. Just...

07:47.299 --> 07:49.366
<i>Yup, CB was determined to win her over.</i>

07:52.070 --> 07:53.904
Oh, wow!

07:54.006 --> 07:55.372
A crimson brushpiper!

07:55.474 --> 07:57.307
They're a protected species, you know.

07:57.376 --> 07:58.308
Oh. Yeah.

07:58.410 --> 08:00.043
Huge brushpiper guy.

08:00.145 --> 08:01.611
- Hey, CB! You wanna...
- Whatever it is, I don't do it!

08:01.713 --> 08:02.879
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

08:02.981 --> 08:05.315
<i>Mellor's advice was actually
kinda working.</i>

08:05.384 --> 08:07.350
What's crazy is,
we're cooling the school

08:07.419 --> 08:08.585
but heating the planet.

08:08.687 --> 08:11.087
Death by irony.
Take that, Alanis Morissette.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.556
Right.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.891
But also, it's been really fun
hanging out with you.

08:14.993 --> 08:16.393
Yeah.

08:16.495 --> 08:19.129
Um... do you want to go out sometime?

08:19.231 --> 08:21.598
- Maybe dinner, something?
- I'd love to.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.333
There's this new vegan
restaurant called Veg Out.

08:23.435 --> 08:24.401
Wanna meet me there at 8:00?

08:24.503 --> 08:25.902
Lettuce meet there.

08:26.004 --> 08:27.003
Ha!

08:27.105 --> 08:29.105
That's a bad joke I heard
a lame guy say once.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.207
Okay.

08:30.309 --> 08:31.274
All right.

08:31.376 --> 08:32.741
Goodb... Goodbye!

08:32.845 --> 08:34.991
Stupid. I gotta stop.

08:35.568 --> 08:36.919
<i>Wilma was officially</i>

08:36.982 --> 08:38.780
<i>the coolest teacher at William Penn,</i>

08:38.825 --> 08:40.024
<i>even if no one knew it yet.</i>

08:40.092 --> 08:42.243
<i>And she had no problem
embracing her new title.</i>

08:42.313 --> 08:45.142
Oh, my God! You look amazing!

08:45.220 --> 08:47.017
I do. I really do.

08:47.085 --> 08:49.185
<i>Hello, everyone.
This is Principal Glascott.</i>

08:49.254 --> 08:51.247
If you don't know me by now...

08:51.302 --> 08:52.722
Okay, the tallies are in,

08:52.791 --> 08:54.858
and it's time to announce
the yearbook superlatives,

08:54.927 --> 08:56.426
starting with the teachers.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.828
Oh, Wilma, you might want
to cover your delicate ears.

08:58.897 --> 09:00.664
- Feelings might get hurt.
- Uh-huh. Okay, then.

09:00.732 --> 09:02.198
<i>"Best Shoulder to Cry On"...</i>

09:02.267 --> 09:03.300
What's this?

09:03.368 --> 09:05.101
Principal Glascott?

09:05.203 --> 09:07.237
Oh, you guys!

09:07.306 --> 09:09.439
Well, I do have an open-shoulder policy

09:09.508 --> 09:11.574
and a very soft sweater vest.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.209
<i>Okay, and now</i>

09:13.278 --> 09:15.445
<i>the title of "Coolest Teacher"...</i>

09:15.514 --> 09:17.681
Well, I think we all know
who's gonna win this one.

09:17.783 --> 09:19.182
<i>...goes to</i>

09:19.284 --> 09:22.118
Ms. Wilma Howell!

09:22.187 --> 09:23.553
What the hell?!

09:23.622 --> 09:25.755
Well, I'll be! That's fun!

09:25.824 --> 09:27.390
I thought you hated superlatives!

09:27.459 --> 09:29.759
Well, it's just
an instinctive human response

09:29.861 --> 09:32.228
when you find out
your students have deemed you

09:32.297 --> 09:34.864
far more cooler than any other teacher.

09:34.933 --> 09:36.700
Okay, all teacher superlative winners,

09:36.802 --> 09:38.568
please report to the gym for photos.

09:38.670 --> 09:39.869
Oh, there's photos?

09:39.972 --> 09:41.004
Wait a minute.

09:41.073 --> 09:43.039
<i>And now on to the students...</i>

09:43.141 --> 09:44.307
Cool top,

09:44.376 --> 09:47.143
gorgeous hair, camera-ready makeup?

09:47.212 --> 09:48.545
You knew you were gonna win.

09:48.647 --> 09:49.713
What?!

09:49.781 --> 09:51.348
That's a wild accusation!

09:51.416 --> 09:52.582
It was a secret ballot.

09:52.651 --> 09:54.184
I didn't even know who was gonna win.

09:54.252 --> 09:56.219
The only way to know was
to open up the sealed envelope,

09:56.288 --> 09:57.965
and to do that, you'd have to be inside

09:58.020 --> 09:59.055
the yearbook classroom.

09:59.124 --> 10:01.257
Okay, so I got a sneak peek
at the results!

10:01.326 --> 10:03.226
But I only did it because
I wanted to help Anna

10:03.328 --> 10:05.195
in case she got "Most Quiet."

10:05.297 --> 10:06.997
And then you found out you won,

10:07.065 --> 10:08.898
and now you're like, "Oh, who me?

10:08.967 --> 10:10.033
This ol' thing?

10:10.135 --> 10:11.434
I guess I'll move to Hollywood

10:11.536 --> 10:12.702
and star in a movie
called 'Coolest Teacher'

10:12.804 --> 10:14.704
that'll open up to mediocre reviews!"

10:14.806 --> 10:17.307
The reviews are in,
and they are glorious!

10:18.543 --> 10:20.710
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. Glascott!

10:22.180 --> 10:24.214
<i>While Wilma was gloating over her win,</i>

10:24.282 --> 10:26.716
<i>CB was psyched to tell Mellor
all about his date.</i>

10:26.818 --> 10:27.751
Rick, hey.

10:27.819 --> 10:29.152
Your advice is really working.

10:29.221 --> 10:32.222
Seriously, Paloma and I
are like two peas in a pod,

10:32.290 --> 10:33.590
which is coincidentally what we ate

10:33.658 --> 10:35.325
at Veg Out last night,
and it was delicious.

10:35.394 --> 10:38.261
I never knew that you could do
so much with a legume.

10:38.363 --> 10:40.663
Well, you've proven to be
very coachable, young Charles.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.287
And as you know,
that's the greatest compliment

10:42.326 --> 10:43.335
I can give anybody.

10:43.368 --> 10:45.068
- Well, seriously, I owe you one.
- Forget about it.

10:45.137 --> 10:46.936
Just name your first born after me.

10:47.039 --> 10:48.605
Rick's a great name for a boy.

10:48.673 --> 10:49.806
Or a girl.

10:52.244 --> 10:54.710
All right, John, I'm ready
for the Mellor Dome confab.

10:54.749 --> 10:57.113
- Oh, hi, Paloma.
- Actually, Paloma just alerted me

10:57.215 --> 10:58.815
that we are having a bit of an issue

10:58.884 --> 10:59.983
with the new stadium site.

11:00.052 --> 11:01.851
CB and I found
an endangered bird species,

11:01.953 --> 11:03.086
the crimson brushpiper,

11:03.155 --> 11:05.155
so we're gonna need to do
an environmental survey.

11:05.223 --> 11:06.256
All right, well, crank that out,

11:06.324 --> 11:07.791
and we'll be ready
to break ground tomorrow.

11:07.893 --> 11:09.292
A-Actually, this could take months,

11:09.394 --> 11:11.294
and the land could be deemed
a protected reserve,

11:11.363 --> 11:12.695
where nothing can ever be built.

11:12.764 --> 11:14.731
Well, I'm deeming you a dream crusher.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.533
Come on, John.
You can't let her do this.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.501
I'm sorry, Rick, but this isn't my call.

11:18.603 --> 11:20.303
We need to bring this to a higher power.

11:20.372 --> 11:21.638
Are you talking about the Lord?

11:21.706 --> 11:24.140
'Cause He'll go baseball
over birds any day.

11:24.242 --> 11:26.142
Not the Lord, the board.

11:26.211 --> 11:28.826
We need to have an open hearing
on this. I'll set it up.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.347
And I'll moderate.

11:31.450 --> 11:33.349
It'll finally give me a chance
to use this

11:33.418 --> 11:35.752
for something other
than cracking walnuts.

11:37.355 --> 11:38.922
I'll see you two in bird court!

11:39.024 --> 11:41.958
<i>As Glascott was bringing down
the hammer, or gavel,</i>

11:42.027 --> 11:44.627
<i>Wilma was still pumped up
over her yearbook superlative.</i>

11:44.729 --> 11:46.529
Yes!

11:46.631 --> 11:48.098
Hello!

11:48.166 --> 11:50.100
Oh, good, a second pair of eyes.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.301
What do you think, Anna?

11:51.403 --> 11:53.203
Which reads more like "Diana Ross

11:53.305 --> 11:55.472
leaving the Super Bowl Halftime
in a helicopter"?

11:55.574 --> 11:56.539
I don't know.

11:56.608 --> 11:58.508
My parents think football's too violent.

11:58.610 --> 12:01.111
Oh. So, how are you feeling?

12:01.213 --> 12:02.679
Pretty relieved you didn't
get "Most Quiet"?

12:02.747 --> 12:04.948
Yeah, but I'm a little sad

12:05.050 --> 12:06.716
because Victor Ramos did get it.

12:06.785 --> 12:08.551
Look at you. So considerate.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.153
Maybe you should have won
"Biggest Heart."

12:10.255 --> 12:12.188
No, I-I don't want a title.

12:12.257 --> 12:13.623
Gunning for "Most Humble," too?

12:13.725 --> 12:14.924
No.

12:14.993 --> 12:16.993
I thought we both agreed
that the superlatives are bad

12:17.095 --> 12:18.661
and you were gonna try
to get rid of them.

12:18.730 --> 12:19.662
I tried.

12:19.764 --> 12:21.164
It's just that they're really popular,

12:21.266 --> 12:22.665
and it's a tradition.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.767
You know, sometimes
you just got to go with the flow

12:24.870 --> 12:26.503
and be happy for the people who won.

12:26.605 --> 12:27.937
You were a lot cooler

12:28.039 --> 12:29.939
before you won "Coolest Teacher."

12:31.376 --> 12:34.544
Remember, don't throw out
those greasy pizza napkins,

12:34.613 --> 12:37.147
'cause they can be repurposed
into scented notebook paper.

12:37.249 --> 12:38.581
CB, can I talk to you for a second?

12:38.683 --> 12:40.049
Abso-fruitly.

12:40.152 --> 12:41.251
One second.

12:42.587 --> 12:43.520
What's up, Rick?

12:43.622 --> 12:45.221
My new stadium is being put on hold,

12:45.323 --> 12:46.322
possibly forever,

12:46.424 --> 12:48.224
because your lady friend
wants to turn the land

12:48.326 --> 12:50.293
into some kind of a weird love field,

12:50.395 --> 12:53.229
where filthy hippies
run around naked with birds!

12:53.331 --> 12:54.364
Oh, wow.

12:54.466 --> 12:55.765
- I-I'm... I'm sorry, Rick.
- Good.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.066
Well, please go talk to Paloma

12:57.169 --> 12:58.568
and make this whole thing go away.

12:58.637 --> 13:00.937
- No can do-skees.
- Why not-skees?

13:00.962 --> 13:01.966
Paloma has taught me

13:02.005 --> 13:04.474
that we all have to make
sacrifices for the planet.

13:04.513 --> 13:06.609
So we can't just take away
a bird's home like that.

13:06.711 --> 13:08.244
You owe me. You said it yourself.

13:08.346 --> 13:09.445
Well, you said, "Forget about it."

13:09.548 --> 13:10.647
That's an expression,

13:10.749 --> 13:13.016
like when mobsters say,
"Fugget-aboud-it!"

13:13.118 --> 13:14.951
Everybody knows
they never forget about it.

13:15.053 --> 13:15.952
I'm sorry, Rick.

13:16.054 --> 13:17.921
I can't back you up on this one.

13:18.023 --> 13:20.256
Why are you acting like you're
Mr. Environment all of a sudden?

13:20.358 --> 13:22.058
You're only pretending
so Paloma will like you.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.726
Is that true, CB?

13:23.828 --> 13:25.228
What? No.

13:25.330 --> 13:26.629
No, no, no. I'm not...

13:26.731 --> 13:28.069
I-I mean, I might have been
pretending at first, but...

13:28.124 --> 13:30.700
Well, congrats.
You tricked me and I fell for it.

13:30.757 --> 13:31.827
Please.

13:35.392 --> 13:36.424
Thank you, Rick.

13:36.484 --> 13:39.474
Um, I really liked her, and you
ruined that, so...

13:39.544 --> 13:40.609
Well, if it wasn't for me,

13:40.680 --> 13:42.558
there never would have been
anything for me to ruin.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.849
<i>It was time for the board
to decide the fate</i>

13:44.912 --> 13:46.474
<i>of Coach Mellor's new baseball stadium.</i>

13:46.518 --> 13:48.428
Order in the bird court!

13:48.498 --> 13:51.465
First of all, if, uh,
anyone would like some walnuts

13:51.551 --> 13:54.879
or if you have nuts of your own
that you need cracking,

13:54.946 --> 13:57.647
please feel free to approach the bench.

13:57.716 --> 13:59.784
The chair recognizes Rick Mellor.

13:59.871 --> 14:01.637
Thank you, Your Honor.

14:02.807 --> 14:03.940
<i>Mellor's entire case</i>

14:03.988 --> 14:05.041
<i>was built on the same thing</i>

14:05.109 --> 14:06.292
<i>he built all his cases on...</i>

14:06.363 --> 14:08.243
<i>in-your-face patriotism.</i>

14:08.313 --> 14:11.214
Ladies and gentlemen of the gym,
I ask you,

14:11.316 --> 14:14.584
what does this flag symbolize?

14:14.634 --> 14:15.651
America!

14:18.790 --> 14:21.224
This apple pie?

14:21.326 --> 14:22.391
America.

14:23.561 --> 14:26.796
This beautiful rawhide-covered sphere

14:26.898 --> 14:29.198
adorned with red stitching?

14:30.301 --> 14:31.467
America.

14:31.536 --> 14:32.969
You know what isn't America?

14:33.071 --> 14:34.270
Birds!

14:34.339 --> 14:37.707
They crap all over
America's cars and dreams

14:37.775 --> 14:40.443
and have been known
to spend half the year

14:40.545 --> 14:41.844
in Canada!

14:42.947 --> 14:45.381
<i>Mellor had the audience
in the palm of his hand,</i>

14:45.450 --> 14:47.416
<i>and it was looking like
his new stadium was a shoo-in.</i>

14:47.518 --> 14:49.752
In conclusion, vote for my stadium

14:49.821 --> 14:52.989
because a vote for the bird
is a vote for communism!

14:54.125 --> 14:56.125
God bless America,

14:56.227 --> 14:59.998
land of the free
and home of the baseball!

15:01.599 --> 15:03.199
<i>Paloma had a tough act to follow.</i>

15:03.301 --> 15:04.732
<i>But she gave it her all.</i>

15:04.757 --> 15:05.778
So, as you can see,

15:05.803 --> 15:07.703
the migratory pattern
of the brushpiper...

15:07.772 --> 15:09.505
<i>Unfortunately, facts and science</i>

15:09.574 --> 15:12.174
<i>always lose to a blowhard
screaming about America.</i>

15:12.277 --> 15:13.843
Boo! Boring!

15:13.945 --> 15:16.012
Who wants some American pie?!

15:17.482 --> 15:19.248
- I object!
- Overruled.

15:19.350 --> 15:20.783
<i>All seemed lost for Paloma,</i>

15:20.852 --> 15:22.618
<i>until something magical happened.</i>

15:22.687 --> 15:24.086
Ca-caw! Save me!

15:24.155 --> 15:27.523
The big, mean baseball stadium
took my home!

15:27.625 --> 15:28.691
Ca-caw!

15:34.866 --> 15:36.799
Thank you. Thank you so much.

15:36.868 --> 15:38.901
I have a few things
I'd like to show the board.

15:39.003 --> 15:42.271
Now, there's nothing more...
magical than...

15:42.373 --> 15:44.373
Mother Nature.

15:44.442 --> 15:46.442
Meet the crimson brushpiper.

15:46.544 --> 15:48.311
- That's him?
- Yes, it is, Rick.

15:48.379 --> 15:50.613
Well, he's just adorable.

15:50.715 --> 15:52.281
He's looking at me.

15:52.383 --> 15:53.816
I feel like we could be friends.

15:53.918 --> 15:55.017
And if we protect him,

15:55.086 --> 15:56.786
next year, we can have even more.

15:56.888 --> 15:57.920
More friends?

15:57.989 --> 15:59.755
But if we don't protect him...

16:02.093 --> 16:03.526
Wait, where'd he go?

16:03.628 --> 16:04.593
I miss him!

16:04.662 --> 16:05.928
I miss him like crazy!

16:06.030 --> 16:07.063
I don't know, Rick.

16:07.165 --> 16:08.864
If we build your stadium,

16:08.933 --> 16:11.133
they may never be back again.

16:11.193 --> 16:12.134
No!

16:12.203 --> 16:13.436
This is America,

16:13.538 --> 16:15.304
home of the crimson brushpiper!

16:15.373 --> 16:16.505
Well, if that's what you think,

16:16.574 --> 16:18.641
then maybe you should side with nature

16:18.710 --> 16:20.509
and let the crimson brushpipers...

16:20.611 --> 16:21.911
flourish.

16:22.013 --> 16:23.212
Smoke, and...

16:26.718 --> 16:28.351
So many brushpipers.

16:28.453 --> 16:29.585
Those are actually doves.

16:29.687 --> 16:31.354
You put on quite a show.

16:31.456 --> 16:32.588
I had to do my thing, Rick.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.623
And that's what you should always do.

16:34.726 --> 16:36.959
I was wrong to tell you
not to be yourself.

16:37.028 --> 16:38.527
I tried to change you.

16:38.629 --> 16:41.530
And in the end... you changed me.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.667
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:44.769 --> 16:47.703
I am withdrawing my argument
against the crimson brushpiper.

16:47.805 --> 16:50.573
We will refurbish the existing stadium.

16:50.675 --> 16:53.442
Well, it's official. The birds win!

16:54.712 --> 16:56.245
Now, would someone get these birds?!

16:56.314 --> 16:58.447
They are eating all of my walnuts!

16:58.549 --> 16:59.648
Thanks so much. Thank you for coming.

16:59.751 --> 17:01.584
<i>While CB had won big-time,</i>

17:01.652 --> 17:03.252
<i>Wilma had never looked so defeated.</i>

17:03.321 --> 17:04.553
What's going on? Talk to me.

17:04.622 --> 17:05.788
When I got "Coolest Teacher,"

17:05.857 --> 17:07.123
I got carried away

17:07.224 --> 17:09.058
and stopped thinking
about students like Anna,

17:09.160 --> 17:10.126
and I shouldn't have,

17:10.228 --> 17:11.794
because I've been
on the other side of it.

17:11.863 --> 17:14.163
Back in high school,
I got voted "Most Studious."

17:14.232 --> 17:15.531
Oh, well, that seems accurate.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.833
It was code for "Biggest Nerd."

17:17.935 --> 17:19.468
The girl who didn't go to parties,

17:19.569 --> 17:21.303
read "Encyclopedia Britannica" for fun,

17:21.372 --> 17:24.473
and went to prom alone
'cause her cousin said "no."

17:24.498 --> 17:25.398
I'm sorry.

17:25.424 --> 17:27.648
It's still pretty awkward
at family reunions.

17:27.712 --> 17:30.713
Anyway, I'm embarrassed
that getting a good superlative

17:30.782 --> 17:32.815
made me forget how hurtful they can be.

17:32.884 --> 17:34.383
But they're supposed
to make you feel good.

17:34.452 --> 17:35.751
The word starts with "super."

17:35.853 --> 17:37.319
Not when they're ones like

17:37.422 --> 17:40.790
"Most Quiet," "Most Studious,"
or "Most Unique."

17:40.858 --> 17:42.858
Or when they don't get anything at all.

17:42.927 --> 17:45.761
Yeah, now I know how that feels.
It's not great.

17:45.786 --> 17:46.813
You know what?

17:46.838 --> 17:47.997
I say this year,

17:48.065 --> 17:49.632
we start making everyone
feel good, for once.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.120
- Can we do that?
- Yeah.

17:51.151 --> 17:53.002
I'm the yearbook adviser.
I can do anything.

17:54.205 --> 17:55.871
Thank you. Thank you.

17:57.675 --> 18:00.576
Well, for someone who isn't
that into the environment,

18:00.645 --> 18:02.378
you sure made a strong case for it.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.079
I'm sorry I misrepresented myself.

18:04.182 --> 18:06.682
It's just I, uh... I really liked you,

18:06.751 --> 18:08.050
and I didn't want you to get scared off

18:08.119 --> 18:10.152
from all the nerdy stuff I'm into.

18:10.221 --> 18:12.588
- What stuff?
- Shadow puppets, silly voices, magic.

18:12.690 --> 18:14.590
Mm, I only have one thing
to say to that.

18:15.927 --> 18:18.494
I don't think any of that stuff
is weird at all.

18:18.596 --> 18:20.162
Well, I have one thing to say to that.

18:21.132 --> 18:22.465
Boom!

18:24.335 --> 18:25.968
- That was really good.
- Thank you.

18:26.037 --> 18:27.837
- Hey, everyone.
- Listen up, guys.

18:27.905 --> 18:29.205
Even though the senior superlatives

18:29.273 --> 18:30.639
were announced earlier this week,

18:30.708 --> 18:32.508
we have a few more to give out.

18:32.610 --> 18:34.276
You all have something
that makes you one of a kind,

18:34.378 --> 18:36.078
and today we're going to celebrate that.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.847
To Brad Kramer,

18:37.949 --> 18:40.182
in honor of his classroom wisecracks,

18:40.251 --> 18:41.450
I give him the superlative for

18:41.519 --> 18:43.152
"Best at Lightening the Mood."

18:43.254 --> 18:45.321
Yes!

18:45.423 --> 18:47.723
- Jokester.
- For Samantha Zachrich

18:47.792 --> 18:49.158
and her incredible notebook doodles,

18:49.260 --> 18:50.793
I give you "Most Artistic."

18:52.029 --> 18:53.529
Well done.

18:53.631 --> 18:55.564
Sometimes the recipient
keeps a low profile,

18:55.666 --> 18:58.634
so their award-worthiness
isn't so easy to see.

18:58.736 --> 19:00.569
That's why I'm happy to give

19:00.671 --> 19:04.039
"Most Likely to Speak Up
and Change the World"

19:04.108 --> 19:05.274
to Anna Whitman.

19:09.714 --> 19:11.947
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. My pleasure.

19:13.184 --> 19:17.253
Jennifer Weisner,
"Most Original Project."

19:17.355 --> 19:18.821
<i>Ernest Hemingway once said,</i>

19:18.923 --> 19:21.893
<i>"The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."</i>

19:21.951 --> 19:23.717
<i>Sometimes it just takes an old friend</i>

19:23.768 --> 19:24.770
<i>to help you realize it.</i>

19:26.831 --> 19:29.164
<i>Other times, it takes a new friend</i>

19:29.267 --> 19:31.929
<i>to help you see that you're
fine just the way you are.</i>

19:34.171 --> 19:36.739
<i>So don't ever
compare yourself to others.</i>

19:36.807 --> 19:40.309
<i>Because the truth is,
we're all special and unique.</i>

19:47.671 --> 19:50.731
<i>You just have to let
your true self shine through.</i>

20:07.471 --> 20:09.509
Well, I hope everyone
enjoyed their long weekend.

20:09.595 --> 20:11.367
I, myself, snuggled up on the couch

20:11.438 --> 20:14.117
and watched a couple
of fantastic movies.

20:14.187 --> 20:16.547
That shook me to my core!

20:16.625 --> 20:18.591
- God, here we go.
- "Volcano"!

20:18.693 --> 20:20.326
We're talking end of days, people!

20:20.428 --> 20:22.528
There are no volcanoes
anywhere near here.

20:22.631 --> 20:25.063
Yeah, that's what Tommy Lee Jones
said, and then, boom!

20:25.157 --> 20:27.251
L.A. became a lava-filled hellscape!

20:28.470 --> 20:29.369
"Twister"!

20:29.471 --> 20:30.770
Mother Nature is pissed!

20:30.848 --> 20:31.887
"Armageddon"!

20:31.949 --> 20:33.047
What's out there?

20:33.141 --> 20:34.474
"Independence Day"!

20:34.576 --> 20:35.842
Who's out there?

20:35.944 --> 20:37.143
"The Sixth Sense."

20:37.245 --> 20:38.878
Guys, be honest with me.

20:38.980 --> 20:40.413
Am I dead?

20:40.515 --> 20:41.514
"Dante's Peak"!

20:41.616 --> 20:42.849
Another volcano!

20:42.951 --> 20:45.218
But now with Pierce Brosnan!

20:45.320 --> 20:46.352
"Face/Off"!

20:46.454 --> 20:48.955
Who wants to switch faces
with ol' Glascott?

20:49.057 --> 20:50.723
The technology is there.

20:50.825 --> 20:52.844
John, can I see
your West Coast Video card?

20:52.894 --> 20:54.460
Yeah, sure.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.860
Great.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.750
Thank you.

21:00.852 --> 21:05.852
