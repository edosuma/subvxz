a Strawberry Latte Bull?

00:20.067 --> 00:21.833

00:21.933 --> 00:23.667

morning beverages.

00:23.767 --> 00:26.900
I'm talking strawberry Quik,
decaf coffee, and Red Bull.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.467
- That's surprising.
- That's--yeah.

00:46.567 --> 00:47.700
- But I'm gonna
choke this one down

00:47.800 --> 00:49.533
because it is symbolic
of our friendship.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.967

you are the quarterback

00:51.067 --> 00:52.567

the world's coming to.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.600
I used to jerk off to
a Sears catalog all the time.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.433
Or was it JCPenney's?

01:07.533 --> 01:09.367
Could have been Cabela's,
but the chicks were super hot.

Oh, direct hit!
- What? No, no, no.

01:15.267 --> 01:16.633
- Hit it right in the face,
right in the beak.

01:16.733 --> 01:18.433
- Oh, God, we got to save it.
We got to save her.

01:18.533 --> 01:19.967
- Yeah, no, it's gargling.
- No, we have to save her.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.767

we could do the proper
Magic Johnson hook shot burial,

01:49.900 --> 01:51.533

since he went out like that.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.200

01:53.300 --> 01:55.167
There's honor in that.
- Poor little dude.

Actually, I don't even know
if it's a dude

01:57.133 --> 01:59.133

are notoriously hard to locate.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.900
I've been looking all morning.

02:01.067 --> 02:02.933

childhood locating bird dicks.

the power of viral marketing.

are a huge emerging demo.

02:55.333 --> 02:56.300

- I get that, yeah.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.833
- For sure, millennials.

- And they're jacked
into their devices 24/7,

03:06.167 --> 03:07.633

all those followers into sales.

engaging with your brands.

07:25.367 --> 07:26.667
takes the other two people
to Havasu.

07:26.767 --> 07:27.867
- That's smart.
- Lake Havasu?

07:27.967 --> 07:29.700
More like
"Blake, be there soon."

07:29.800 --> 07:30.867
[laughter]

07:30.967 --> 07:32.233
- You are inviting us, though,
right?

07:32.333 --> 07:34.167
- Yeah. Hold up, though.
Check your phones.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.333
[cell phones chime]

07:35.433 --> 07:38.433
- Oh, my God.
You followed me.

07:38.533 --> 07:41.267
I feel all warm and fuzzy.
- Hey, and guess what.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.233
You guys
just got another follower.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.267
- Who? [gasps] Ders.
- Yeah.

07:45.367 --> 07:46.733
[cell phone chimes]
- I didn't get it yet.

07:46.833 --> 07:47.833
You sent it?
- Whoa, I just got a follower.

07:47.933 --> 07:50.067
Who's @SilliestJilly?

07:50.167 --> 07:51.900
- Oh, that's me.
That's me.

07:52.067 --> 07:54.667
I'm so excited
to be following @Dersmerica

07:54.767 --> 07:59.067
and @YungChillunerr
and @AdamnBilzarian.

07:59.167 --> 08:01.133
I, like, can't wait to see
what you guys do.

08:01.233 --> 08:03.200
I'm on, like,
everything social media,

08:03.300 --> 08:05.067
so follow me back.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.067
- Awesome, very cool.
- Get out of my way!

08:07.100 --> 08:08.300
- Oh, ouch!
- Bill, what's wrong with you?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.133
- Ouch, Bill.
- My Klout Score.

08:10.233 --> 08:11.667
Everything was going so well.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.367
I had 20 followers on Twitter,

08:13.467 --> 08:16.467
then got 45 likes
on a meme I posted on IG.

08:16.567 --> 08:20.367
And then I got cocky
and tried Periscope.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.667
- Cocky Periscope.
Yeah, I've heard of that.

08:22.767 --> 08:24.300
It's when you pull
your cocky out

08:24.400 --> 08:26.367
and put it through the sunroof
of a moving vehicle.

08:26.467 --> 08:27.900
- Mm-hmm.
- Right? Is it?

08:28.067 --> 08:30.233
- No, it's livestreaming video.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.667
- So not what I said.
- No.

08:31.767 --> 08:33.133
- That's cool, though.
- Okay.

08:33.233 --> 08:34.467
- It's livestreaming video.

08:34.567 --> 08:35.567
And I accidentally
yelled the F word

08:35.667 --> 08:37.233
and not even in a mean way.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.800
I was just talking about
gay people. Now I'm ruined.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.200
- Poor guy.
[cell phone chimes]

08:41.300 --> 08:43.733
- Note to self--
don't try Periscope.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.767
- Check it out--
my dumbass dad

08:45.867 --> 08:49.733
fell asleep while waiting
to pick me up from school.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.533

- [laughs]
- God damn it, Son!

09:04.133 --> 09:06.600
- Suck it, Dad.
Sorry, not sorry.

09:06.700 --> 09:10.833
- God, you stupid--you're
so stupid, @YungChillunerr.

09:10.933 --> 09:12.500
You're so stupid,
@YungChillunerr.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.533
- Okay, just say it once.

[upbeat music]

09:15.433 --> 09:18.100
- Psst. Hey, Brenda!
Hold this.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.800
Did you get it?
- Yep, yep, yep.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.467
- Follow me, @AdamnBilzarian.
- Got it. Let's go.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.067
- Instagram.
- Got it. Got it. Go. Go.

09:25.133 --> 09:26.933
- America.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.867
It's an idea.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.633
Bootstraps.

09:30.733 --> 09:32.067
The call of an eagle.

09:32.133 --> 09:34.133

but I salute it.

Chinese, Japanese,
dirty knees, look at these.

09:46.067 --> 09:47.533
Sure, it sounds Asian,

09:47.633 --> 09:49.967
but I guarantee you
it was written by an American.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.067
That's what I'm talking about.

with my sling-shoot,

Now--now don't act cold or sad.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.933
I know that'll be
the initial feeling.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.100
You're supposed to be sexy,
okay?

10:02.200 --> 10:03.467
We're going sexy.
Ready?

10:03.567 --> 10:06.300
- Hey, Anders,
are you with us or, like--

10:06.400 --> 10:08.033
- What?
Oh, sorry, dudes.

10:08.133 --> 10:10.267
Please call me Andy Holmes,
guys.

10:10.367 --> 10:12.533
Just sounds more American
for my brand.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.933
- I won't do that.
Ready, Blake?

- Yeah, Son?

- They're my shoes.

I would never do that.

off my Strawberry Latte Bull?

- No, no, no, I'm just gonna
drink the Red Bull.

10:47.700 --> 10:48.600
- And coffee here.

10:48.700 --> 10:49.700
- Whatever. Don't care.

- There's my boys,

Rancho's three biggest
web celebs.

- You think I'm a celeb?

10:56.100 --> 10:57.433
- Totes McGoats, man.

10:57.533 --> 10:58.567
You've been cranking out
some epic content.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.467
- Appreciate it.

11:00.567 --> 11:02.100
- So you ready to leverage your
brand outside of your core demo?

11:02.200 --> 11:03.633
- [chuckles]
- Sure.

11:03.733 --> 11:05.733
- You tell me.
- Uh, then check it.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.333
This is the EZ Egger.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.400
- Ooh, I like it.
Impressive.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.833
What's--what does it do?

11:10.933 --> 11:13.633
- It makes cooking eggs
up to 65% easier.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.300
- Uh, yeah.
- Eggs are tough.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.967
- I'm not sure
that's on brand for me, bro.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.967
- Yeah, my flock
doesn't like to cut corners,

11:19.067 --> 11:20.800
so count me out.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.600
- Yeah, it--it really doesn't
matter at this point, man.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.133
I mean, your followers should
buy whatever you tell them.

11:24.233 --> 11:25.267
That's why
they're called followers.

11:25.367 --> 11:27.067
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.267
- That's why
they're called followers.

11:28.367 --> 11:29.333
- Yeah.
- Is it--

11:29.433 --> 11:30.833
- Where's my coconut water?

11:30.933 --> 11:33.267
I told corporate
this was non-negosh.

11:33.367 --> 11:35.300
Alice!
- Alice!

11:35.400 --> 11:36.900
- He's pissed.
- Man, later.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.300
- Trilly's--Trilly's the best.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.833
Hey, you guys need to clear
out of here.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.700
I'm gonna film
a new Instagram video where

11:41.800 --> 11:45.333
I karate chop my head through
a vodka-infused candied ham.

11:45.433 --> 11:46.967
I'm calling it
a "feast of strength."

11:47.067 --> 11:49.833
- No, you can't, because
I'm about to christen this

11:49.933 --> 11:51.800
the "Ronald Reagan
Memorial Break Room," so...

11:51.900 --> 11:54.800
- Mmm, no, you guys
are gonna have to leave.

11:54.900 --> 11:59.233
But luckily for you, you bought
yourself a few extra minutes

11:59.333 --> 12:01.533
because I have to go poo-poo.

12:01.633 --> 12:02.533
- All right.
- Go take a Blake.

12:02.633 --> 12:03.800
- I'll be back.

12:03.900 --> 12:04.967
- Yeah, don't forget
to wipe your--

12:05.067 --> 12:07.067
Uh, what are you?
Andy?

12:07.167 --> 12:08.267
I don't know what you're calling
yourself, you idiot.

12:08.367 --> 12:09.967
- You wish.

12:10.067 --> 12:13.200
Hey, uh, noticed you hadn't
connected with me on LinkedIn.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.433
So if you could do that,
that'd be great.

12:14.533 --> 12:15.767
Thanks.

12:15.867 --> 12:20.467
- LinkedIn is
for lame old try-hards.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.233
- Are you calling me old?

12:22.333 --> 12:23.933
Hey, never forget 9/11.

12:24.067 --> 12:27.067
Also, never forget
how old you really are.

12:27.167 --> 12:28.233
- Oh.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.200
- I want to see
a birth certificate.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.900
- Oh, let me see your ID, 'cause
I'm pretty sure it reads Anders.

12:33.067 --> 12:35.133
Hmm? Doesn't sound very American
to me, does it?

12:35.233 --> 12:36.700
You freakin' birther.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.233
- I'm American.
Let's see a birth certificate.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.700
- Oh, well, let's see
what your real name is.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.133
It's Anders--
- All right, time's up.

12:41.233 --> 12:43.133
- There is no way
you wiped your butt.

12:43.233 --> 12:45.167
- Uh, yeah, no,
I didn't have to wipe,

12:45.267 --> 12:46.533
because it came out
in just one--

12:46.633 --> 12:47.933
it just fell right out.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.600
Time to freakin' go.
- You know what?

12:49.700 --> 12:51.267
Both you guys suck.

12:51.367 --> 12:54.200
I'm gonna stack some Klout
points and go to Havasu solo.

12:54.300 --> 12:55.633
- Oh, my gosh.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.933
I can't believe
you're all together IRL.

12:58.067 --> 12:59.867
Uh, could I get a quick selfie
for Facebook?

13:00.067 --> 13:02.067
- Uh...
- Me in a photo with these guys?

13:02.133 --> 13:03.433
I don't think so.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.667
- Yeah, but you guys
are the @The3BestFrandz.

13:05.767 --> 13:07.100
- Uh, not anymore.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.733
- I can't be in a picture
with these guys.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.567
It's just--
wouldn't make sense, really.

13:10.667 --> 13:14.200
- Well, but I'm a Blaker Girl,
and I'm an Adam Madam.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.167
And I'm Randy for Andy.
- That's not his real name.

13:16.267 --> 13:18.067
- I can't choose one.
- Well, you kind of have to.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.367
- Yeah.
- Don't be stupid.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.233
It's whoever's best
at social media.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.600
- Pick one of us right now.
- Please don't do this to me!

13:22.700 --> 13:24.200
- Just choose one!
- What are we doing?

13:24.300 --> 13:26.733
- You pick one of us!
- Gosh damn it, boys!

13:26.833 --> 13:30.867
What are we gonna do
come Christmas?

13:30.967 --> 13:32.400
I loved you!

13:32.500 --> 13:34.067
All of you!

13:34.133 --> 13:36.767
- [beatboxing]

13:41.333 --> 13:43.100
- America.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.667
Farmers, chickens, eggs.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.400
The foundation of life,

13:47.500 --> 13:50.567
regardless of whatever
Planned Parenthood tells you.

13:50.667 --> 13:54.500
But I always say, when life
tries to hard-boil you,

13:54.600 --> 13:55.900
just hard-boil eggs

13:56.067 --> 13:58.833
in under three minutes
with the EZ Egger.

13:58.933 --> 14:02.333
Real hard-boiled eggs.

14:02.433 --> 14:03.333
That's good.

14:03.433 --> 14:04.900
- God bless America.

14:05.067 --> 14:08.333
Get ready to soar once again.

14:08.433 --> 14:10.100
- Ah!
- Oh!

14:10.200 --> 14:12.633
Oh, that old yuppie
just hit a baby bald eagle!

14:12.733 --> 14:13.733
[laughs]

14:13.833 --> 14:16.067
- Who did that?
What was that?

14:16.167 --> 14:20.300
- Remember to follow me,
YungChillunerr on Snapchat.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.467
- I see you!

14:21.567 --> 14:23.067
- You know how it is.

14:23.167 --> 14:24.867
You're vaped out of your mind.
You're starving.

14:24.967 --> 14:26.133
You got the munchies.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.733
All you want
is some cooked eggs,

14:27.833 --> 14:31.367
but to make them is...

14:31.467 --> 14:32.700
freakin' hard.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.467
[chuckles]
It sucks, but not anymore.

14:35.567 --> 14:36.967
Now it's really easy.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.067
- Hey, Son.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.067
Have you seen
my EZ Egger?

14:40.167 --> 14:41.967
- Uh, no.

14:42.067 --> 14:43.200
Why don't you check your butt,

14:43.300 --> 14:46.133
where you keep everything else,
Dad?

14:46.233 --> 14:48.833
EZ Egger.

14:48.933 --> 14:50.500
Okay.

[dramatic music]

14:55.467 --> 14:56.967
- [sighs]

14:57.067 --> 14:59.900
How unfortunate to hear
about all the Internet backlash,

15:00.067 --> 15:01.400
but I suppose the truth

15:01.500 --> 15:03.300
was going to rear its ugly head
sooner or later.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.300
- Okay, cut the camera.
Yeah, right.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.067
What are you talking about?

15:06.133 --> 15:09.233
- Well, I guess someone leaked
a pic of your birth certificate

15:09.333 --> 15:11.600
and posted it on Vine.

15:11.700 --> 15:12.967
Oops.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.067
- Karl, give me my phone.

Wait, you can't--

15:19.933 --> 15:22.067
I hate you, Ders!

15:22.133 --> 15:24.933
I hate you!
I got to go, Karl.

15:25.067 --> 15:27.533
I got to go.
- Okay. Okay.

15:27.633 --> 15:30.600
Oh, hey,
are you gonna eat these eggs?

15:30.700 --> 15:32.633
Okay,
going to the 60-second rule.

15:32.733 --> 15:33.833
It's all me, baby.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.067
- Hope you're happy, Andy,

15:36.100 --> 15:37.467
because my Klout Score
is ruined.

15:37.567 --> 15:39.833
- Oh, give it a rest, Henderson.

15:39.933 --> 15:42.267
You know you brought this
hellfire down on both of us.

15:42.367 --> 15:43.667
- Doesn't matter anymore.

15:43.767 --> 15:45.533
Neither of us are going
to Lake Havasu now.

15:45.633 --> 15:47.133
- Oh, well,
maybe Adam can go.

15:47.233 --> 15:48.767
- Yeah, maybe I could go

15:48.867 --> 15:51.800
if Instagram didn't just
shut down my account.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.667
- What?
- Oh, so you sabotaged him too.

15:53.767 --> 15:55.367
- Don't give me too much credit.
I wish I did that.

15:55.467 --> 15:57.100
- That's--that's not
what happened.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.067
I tried to hold a contest
for sickest tank pic of the day,

16:00.167 --> 16:03.833
and then this girl, she showed
me, uh, a pic of her jambos.

16:03.933 --> 16:07.067
And so I was like, this deserves
more than a repost,

16:07.133 --> 16:08.400
which was going to be the prize.
both: Right.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.667
- But I know how chicks work.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.100
It's tick for tack.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.467
She wanted to see the D.
You know what I mean?

16:12.567 --> 16:13.833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:13.933 --> 16:14.967
- So I sent her a picture
of my dick,

16:15.067 --> 16:16.100
and instead of sending it
to her,

16:16.200 --> 16:17.733
I posted it on the Instagram.

16:17.833 --> 16:19.733
- Oh, you're on blast.
- Uh-oh.

16:19.833 --> 16:20.967
- I mean,
I still got the jambo pic.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.300
You want to see it?
both: Yeah.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.800
- Oh, yeah.
Those are sweater pups.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.733
- Oh, nice.
- They're good, right?

16:25.833 --> 16:27.800
They're good.
They're my cousin Tracy's.

They are nice.

16:30.267 --> 16:31.800
- Oh. Okay.
I'm sorry.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.267
I didn't know that
when I sent the dick pic.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.800
I should've known,
because I know those tits.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.167
- Yeah.
- DeMamps.

16:37.267 --> 16:38.633
We're known
for our giant titties.

- Guys.

16:39.767 --> 16:41.600
Hey, guys. Question.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.100
What happened to us?

16:43.200 --> 16:44.833
I mean, look at--
this is insane.

16:44.933 --> 16:46.500
We're not these dumb brands,
right?

16:46.600 --> 16:48.067
- Right.
- I know it, man.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.800
I mean, we used to just be
three best friends

16:49.900 --> 16:52.500
who liked looking at,
you know, big ol' chumbawumbas.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.267
- We're just horny,
horny titty boys.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.667
- Would've seen
a lot of them in Havasu.

- And birdwatching.

- And the birdwatching.

17:05.967 --> 17:07.867
Wait a second.

17:07.967 --> 17:09.533
There's one more thing
we can do.

17:09.633 --> 17:11.300
It'll get our Klout Scores
right through the roof.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.067
But if we mess it up,

17:13.167 --> 17:15.100
I'm serious when I say
we can never show our faces

17:15.200 --> 17:16.700

17:16.800 --> 17:18.567
- Tell us.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

- How many of you are sick
of pretending

18:21.433 --> 18:23.767
you're someone you aren't
just to get followers?

18:23.867 --> 18:25.967
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. For example, Ghostman.

18:26.067 --> 18:28.200
We all know that you're not
in a biker gang, man.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.433
You had a poem published
in the newspaper last week.

18:30.533 --> 18:32.467
- That was my wife's obituary.

18:32.567 --> 18:34.133
- Yes.
- Oh.

- And then, Waymond,
you're not Redfoo.

No one wants to party rock
at your house tonight.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.100

those stupid [bleep] glasses.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.700

the same goes for you, Diane.

to rule Black Twitter, okay?

- Yeah, you're complex, dude.

about my friends, all right?

to be a brand for likes.

I'm not a brand.

getting a little out of control?

is garbage.

Okay, great.

tell corporate

corporate that ever since
