WEBVTT

00:04.132 --> 00:06.134
(CHAINSAW WHIRRING)

00:20.815 --> 00:23.026
-Morning.
-Morning.

00:34.037 --> 00:37.123
-(EXCLAIMING) Who's that?
-Nobody.

00:37.206 --> 00:40.126
Duncan, she's all body.

00:40.209 --> 00:43.338
Oh, is that your wee friend?
The one that
sends you letters?

00:43.421 --> 00:44.839
No.

00:44.922 --> 00:49.510
"To Duncan, from your
pen-friend, Marie-Helene."

00:49.594 --> 00:52.597
Five kisses. French kisses.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.516
Look, it's not like that.
We're just good fr...

00:56.309 --> 00:57.769
She's got a boyfriend.

00:57.852 --> 01:00.646
-Well, that can change.
-I've never even met her.

01:00.730 --> 01:03.941
Well, that can change, too.
Here, Telemessage for you.

01:04.025 --> 01:08.571
-You opened it.
-Thought I'd
save you the bother.

01:08.654 --> 01:12.283
What? It's good news,
isn't it? She's coming here.

01:12.367 --> 01:14.160
-She can't.
-Why, what's up?

01:14.243 --> 01:16.996
-I cannae tell you.
-Well, we'll soon find out.

01:18.498 --> 01:20.625
She'll be on the train by now.

02:00.331 --> 02:03.835
Bonjour, ici Duncan,

02:03.918 --> 02:08.464
the ami de stylo
of Marie-Helene

02:08.548 --> 02:11.133
en Ecosse. But I'm not here.

02:11.217 --> 02:14.721
I'm going away, en vacances.

02:14.804 --> 02:16.889
(CORRECTING HIS
FRENCH PRONUNCIATION)

02:16.973 --> 02:18.725
Sorry, en vacances.

02:20.727 --> 02:23.104
Let me guess...

02:23.187 --> 02:26.399
Your friend Marie-Helene.
Lexie told me all about her.

02:26.482 --> 02:29.068
She's not there.
Just voice mail.

02:29.152 --> 02:33.072
-But you're going to see
her in a couple of hours.
-No, I won't be here.

02:33.156 --> 02:35.533
-I'm going to my mother's.
-No, Duncan.

02:36.534 --> 02:38.786
When I was at school,

02:38.870 --> 02:40.955
I had
a pen-friend called Simone

02:41.039 --> 02:44.083
and I used to make
up all sorts of things
just to entertain her.

02:44.167 --> 02:46.878
And then one day,
I was absolutely terrified

02:46.961 --> 02:50.381
that she might
turn up and visit
and discover that the real me

02:50.465 --> 02:54.385
wasn't at all like I
was in the letters.

02:54.469 --> 02:57.513
But I'm sure
that you would never
do anything like that.

02:57.597 --> 02:59.640
I would. I did.

02:59.724 --> 03:02.769
I told her a pack of lies and
now she's coming here with her
fancy French boyfriend

03:02.852 --> 03:05.313
and I'm not sticking round
to look like
a complete numpty.

03:05.396 --> 03:08.107
Oh, dear. How long have
you been writing to her?

03:08.191 --> 03:10.443
Since I was 13.
Miss Skinner's class.

03:10.526 --> 03:14.572
So you'd really like to see
her again. Marie-Helene,
I mean, not Miss Skinner.

03:14.655 --> 03:16.783
I've always
dreamed of seeing her.

03:16.866 --> 03:22.455
It was a silly kid's thing,
but when I was at school, I
was kind of in love with her.

03:24.123 --> 03:28.294
Right,
Duncan, let's make it happen.

03:28.378 --> 03:30.088
What?

03:32.923 --> 03:35.510
How come you've stopped
eating with the grown-ups?

03:37.970 --> 03:41.140
You enjoy the scintillating
conversation with me.

03:43.226 --> 03:46.771
-What's happened?
-Nothing.

03:46.854 --> 03:49.065
Well, is it bad news?

03:50.316 --> 03:53.277
It's my divorce.

03:53.361 --> 03:56.989
I never thought it
would be so fast.

03:57.073 --> 04:00.993
It's not bad news at all,
it great news.
I'm just being stupid.

04:02.453 --> 04:07.208
Look, if you want to cry,
then just cry.

04:08.209 --> 04:09.794
It's your divorce.

04:09.877 --> 04:12.046
I don't want to.

04:13.297 --> 04:16.009
Why do I let
him do this to me?

04:16.091 --> 04:18.845
You're asking me?

04:18.928 --> 04:23.141
Fat lot I know.
Remember Stuart?

04:23.224 --> 04:28.021
Well, if there's one thing I
do know, it's that
they're not worth it.

04:28.104 --> 04:30.523
None of them.

04:30.606 --> 04:32.859
Oh, this is pathetic.

04:32.942 --> 04:35.737
I should be cracking
open the champagne.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.947
Want me to go and get
you some from the shop?

04:38.031 --> 04:39.782
No, I'll get it.

04:41.743 --> 04:44.203
Are you doing
anything tonight?

04:44.287 --> 04:46.664
Me? No.

04:46.748 --> 04:50.335
Well, you are now.
I'm not drinking on my own.

04:50.418 --> 04:51.919
Okay.

04:56.174 --> 04:58.051
(DOGS BARKING)

05:10.438 --> 05:14.025
-Can I help?
-Those dogs should be
kept under proper control.

05:14.942 --> 05:17.570
Monty, Rommel, come on.

05:17.653 --> 05:21.282
I'm sorry, this garden
isn't open to the public.
There is a sign.

05:21.366 --> 05:25.328
I believe you'll find
I'm within my legal rights
as I'm not causing any damage.

05:25.411 --> 05:29.123
And by the by, the
internationally accepted form
for that sign

05:29.207 --> 05:31.334
is a red-rimmed circle
containing a walking figure

05:31.417 --> 05:33.920
struck through
with a red oblique line.

05:34.003 --> 05:35.922
Would you excuse me?

05:39.384 --> 05:43.513
Ah, now I've got you all here,
I've got some good
news from the hospital.

05:43.596 --> 05:46.473
They say that Hector
is really improving.

05:46.557 --> 05:48.184
That's not a word
often used about him.

05:48.267 --> 05:50.603
It may be some time before he
can sit down again,

05:50.687 --> 05:52.855
but remember,
we don't talk about it.

05:52.939 --> 05:55.608
Well, people are asking.
I need to tell them something.

05:55.692 --> 05:59.487
I just say that Glenbogle's
not the only ancient pile
that's been troubling him.

05:59.570 --> 06:01.656
That seems to work.

06:01.739 --> 06:05.284
-Sorry.
-Ah, here you are.
We need you.

06:05.368 --> 06:08.955
-Sounds ominous.
-Not at all.

06:09.038 --> 06:12.208
-Duncan has a problem.
-Just the one?

06:12.291 --> 06:17.338
His friend, Marie-Helene, has
clearly misunderstood one
of Duncan's letters.

06:17.422 --> 06:19.257
French can be such
a tricky language.

06:19.340 --> 06:22.218
I mean, you ask for a
hairbrush and they bring
you a horse brush.

06:22.301 --> 06:27.932
It's all too, too muddling.
Anyway, as I was saying, dear
Marie-Helene seems confused

06:28.016 --> 06:31.144
about what it is that
Duncan actually does.

06:31.227 --> 06:35.064
Well, that's no surprise. Half
the time Duncan's confused
about what he actually does.

06:35.148 --> 06:39.027
And Duncan's worried
that his French
friends will be disappointed.

06:39.110 --> 06:43.239
So, I thought it
would be easier all round
if, just for a couple of days,

06:43.322 --> 06:48.286
Duncan became
the Laird of Glenbogle.

06:48.369 --> 06:53.166
You told her you
were the laird?

06:53.249 --> 06:55.877
-Kind of.
-And as far as she's
concerned, he will be.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.628
Everyone happy?

06:57.712 --> 07:01.674
Now, just hold on a wee
minute. Duncan has a job
to do, I rely on him.

07:01.758 --> 07:03.343
Archie can do that.

07:03.426 --> 07:06.721
You want me to do Duncan's job
and Duncan to do mine?

07:06.804 --> 07:08.890
Very good, dear.

07:08.973 --> 07:12.226
It would've taken me hours
to explain something like
that to your father.

07:53.351 --> 07:57.480
-Not feel like
emptying that one, no?
-Didn't see it.

07:57.563 --> 07:59.148
If a job's worth
doing, Archie.

07:59.232 --> 08:01.901
I know, I know.
Give me a chance.

08:05.822 --> 08:10.367
-Soon get the hang of it.
-Excuse me,
I have a complaint.

08:10.451 --> 08:13.121
It concerns your equipment.

08:13.204 --> 08:15.248
That lifebelt holder would
appear to be empty.

08:15.331 --> 08:17.500
There's another
one just there.

08:17.583 --> 08:19.210
And what's more, there's
nobody out on the loch.

08:19.293 --> 08:21.629
And as far as I know,
we're not
expecting the Titanic.

08:21.713 --> 08:27.176
Well, you may not take the
danger of drowning seriously,
but I most certainly do.

08:27.260 --> 08:30.304
A member of my family
drowned in that loch.
I take it very seriously.

08:30.388 --> 08:34.017
But that doesn't run
to supplying
adequate safety equipment?

08:34.100 --> 08:36.059
Most slipshod.

08:36.144 --> 08:38.270
You're doing this
'cause I threw you out
of the garden, aren't you?

08:38.354 --> 08:42.066
No, I'm merely
drawing your attention
to the fact that...

08:42.150 --> 08:44.944
-Perhaps you'd like your
entrance fee back, then?
-No, Archie.

08:45.028 --> 08:47.989
GOLLY: Steady, easy.

08:48.072 --> 08:50.116
You're talking to
the wrong person.

08:50.199 --> 08:53.411
If you've got a problem,
take it to the estate office.

08:58.958 --> 09:02.337
We arrive at the table
like this. And then...

09:03.838 --> 09:06.549
-Duncan.
-Oh, sorry.

09:15.308 --> 09:17.018
Thank you.

09:28.321 --> 09:29.906
(CLEARING THROAT)

09:29.989 --> 09:31.949
Would you like to taste?

09:33.576 --> 09:35.244
Yes, please.

09:51.594 --> 09:55.181
-I don't know.
-Mmm, not good enough for you?

09:56.307 --> 09:59.102
Perhaps the '92
would be better?

09:59.185 --> 10:00.687
(BOTH LAUGHING)

10:00.770 --> 10:03.815
Oh, well done, wee man.
He more like
Archie than Archie.

10:05.775 --> 10:08.903
I understand that
you accommodate paying guests.

10:08.986 --> 10:11.572
I'll require an inexpensive
room for the night.

10:11.656 --> 10:15.576
That's no problem.
We have one with
a view of the loch.

10:15.660 --> 10:17.995
I'm not here for the scenery.

10:19.122 --> 10:20.832
I've gotta go to the station.

10:20.915 --> 10:23.209
-This is Mr Barr.
-Yeah, we met.

10:23.292 --> 10:25.628
He the Assistant
Chief Inspector

10:25.712 --> 10:28.798
with the Regional
Health and Safety Executive.

10:32.844 --> 10:34.762
I see.

10:34.846 --> 10:39.267
He's here to carry out
a spot check inspection
and he wants you to help him.

10:39.350 --> 10:42.603
-Me?
-You are the Head Ranger,
are you not?

10:42.687 --> 10:45.732
-Um, yeah, yeah.
-Good.

10:45.815 --> 10:49.193
In that case, we start
tomorrow at 9:00 prompt.

10:55.366 --> 10:58.828
Go get the barrow,
she might have more
bags than you can carry.

10:58.911 --> 11:01.372
Listen, you don't give
the orders round here.
Duncan's the laird.

11:01.456 --> 11:02.999
And you are Duncan.

11:03.082 --> 11:05.460
So that means we can
all boss you around.

11:09.797 --> 11:11.090
Right, she's not
here. Let's go.

11:11.174 --> 11:13.885
No, no.
Uh-uh. Is that her there?

11:13.968 --> 11:15.511
No.

11:17.347 --> 11:20.266
Ah,
Duncan, is that Marie-Helene?

11:28.232 --> 11:32.111
-Ooh-la-la.
-Duncan, she's lovely.

11:42.163 --> 11:45.375
-Maybe this isn't a good idea.
-Of course it is.
Courage, mon ami.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.502
What?

11:49.587 --> 11:51.839
-Bonjour.
-Duncan, hello.

12:01.307 --> 12:03.768
(READING OUT IN FRENCH)

12:23.663 --> 12:29.085
By the way,
I'm Molly, Duncan's mother.
And this is Lexie.

12:29.168 --> 12:32.171
-And that's Archie.
-He'll take your bags for you.

12:32.255 --> 12:35.383
Are you alone?
I thought you were
coming with a friend.

12:35.466 --> 12:39.137
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't say in the telegram.

12:39.220 --> 12:42.348
-Alain had to
stay in Edinburgh.
-Oh, what a shame.

12:42.432 --> 12:44.350
Anyway,
it's lovely to see you.

12:45.226 --> 12:46.978
Archie.

12:49.731 --> 12:51.357
Land Rover.

12:52.817 --> 12:54.360
Where's the Ferrari?

12:54.444 --> 12:58.614
Er, the Ferrari's
got a burst thingy.

12:58.698 --> 13:03.870
Um, yeah. I mean,
it does that all the time.
You know, bursts its thingy.

13:19.344 --> 13:21.763
Duncan, this is unbelievable.

13:21.846 --> 13:23.431
No, it's all true.

13:24.974 --> 13:26.559
When you talked
about the house,

13:26.642 --> 13:30.563
I didn't realise it
was so big and so old
and so beautiful.

13:30.646 --> 13:32.023
Just like you.

13:32.106 --> 13:34.817
I mean, not big and old...

13:40.907 --> 13:45.411
-Now,
where have we met before?
-We haven't.

13:45.495 --> 13:48.915
Oh, I'm sure I know
your face from somewhere.

13:51.834 --> 13:54.253
Tell me about
health and safety.

13:54.337 --> 13:57.799
-It must be terribly exciting.
-No, it isn't.

13:57.882 --> 14:02.178
But you seem to have so much
to do. What were you
measuring just now?

14:02.261 --> 14:08.017
The noise level's over the
limit. Your piper should be
wearing ear defenders.

14:08.101 --> 14:11.270
But it'll have to wait.
I'm on
a scheduled meal break now.

14:11.354 --> 14:14.857
Oh,
good, then we can talk about
the off-duty Mr Barr.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.026
I want to know all about you.

14:17.110 --> 14:21.322
Do you have children?
I suppose if you did,
they'd be called Mini-Barrs.

14:21.406 --> 14:23.491
I don't and they wouldn't.

14:25.493 --> 14:29.497
-But there's a Mrs Barr?
-Yes.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.958
What a shame she
couldn't have come with you.

14:32.041 --> 14:36.254
My wife recently left me
to live with
a chiropodist in Devon

14:36.337 --> 14:38.715
and she doesn't
return my calls.

14:38.798 --> 14:41.509
Oh, I'm... I'm so, so sorry.

14:46.764 --> 14:48.933
Roast venison.

14:49.017 --> 14:53.563
Lexie, you're meant to
serve the guests first.

14:53.646 --> 14:57.608
And you're meant
to carve, my laird.

15:11.039 --> 15:12.832
(KNOCKING ON THE DOOR)

15:12.915 --> 15:14.292
Oh, hi.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.711
-Not quite what
you're used to, huh?
-Right.

15:16.794 --> 15:18.296
Did you manage
to find those books?

15:18.379 --> 15:21.174
I reckon Duncan's got
most of what you need.

15:21.257 --> 15:26.220
Right, what have we got here?
Working With Wild Birds,

15:26.304 --> 15:29.599
First Aid Basic,
First Aid Advanced,

15:30.933 --> 15:32.643
and a safety manual.

15:32.727 --> 15:35.980
-And where's
the important stuff?
-It's all important, Archie.

15:36.064 --> 15:39.067
That's why I've
been sending Duncan
on courses for the last year.

15:39.150 --> 15:42.987
Don't you think it just might
be a good idea to tell this
inspector chappie the truth?

15:43.071 --> 15:44.906
No, I don't wanna
spoil Duncan's big day.

15:44.989 --> 15:47.408
You know Health and Safety
can shut us down on the spot?

15:47.492 --> 15:50.661
Only if he finds something
wrong, which he won't do
once I've read this lot.

15:50.745 --> 15:53.498
I'm determined not
to leave anything
up to chance.

15:53.581 --> 15:54.999
Like your toast?

15:57.335 --> 16:00.713
Like I said,
why don't you just
tell this guy the truth?

16:06.552 --> 16:09.430
I brought you something.
It's from
the shop where I work.

16:09.514 --> 16:11.933
-Oh, wow.
-It's nothing special.

16:16.145 --> 16:20.650
Oh, I've always wanted
one that does stunts.
It's brilliant.

16:22.402 --> 16:26.864
May I look at your photos?
Are they all of your family?

16:26.948 --> 16:31.869
Um, family and friends.

16:31.953 --> 16:33.788
Are there none of Duncan?

16:33.871 --> 16:38.751
No, he doesn't like
having his photograph taken.

16:38.835 --> 16:42.046
-Lots of Archie.
-Yeah, of course.

16:43.965 --> 16:45.591
Why?

16:48.720 --> 16:50.680
I'm very fond of Archie.

16:50.763 --> 16:54.559
-The chauffeur?
-He's a sort of
project of mine.

16:54.642 --> 16:58.229
Poor Archie. Comes
from a very good family.

16:58.312 --> 17:03.443
But he went to the bad.
Drink, drugs, joy-riding.

17:03.526 --> 17:08.031
And the only way to keep him
out of prison,
or the lunatic asylum,

17:08.114 --> 17:10.450
was to give him
a job on the estate.

17:10.532 --> 17:12.617
You mean he's mad?

17:12.702 --> 17:15.496
If that's the Head
Ranger you're referring to,

17:15.579 --> 17:18.750
he did strike me
as being somewhat on
the unreliable side.

17:18.833 --> 17:22.962
Oh, he does his best
considering, poor lamb.

17:23.046 --> 17:26.257
Ah, I see you're
admiring our roses.

17:27.967 --> 17:31.554
Nothing wrong, is there?
Dangerous thorns,
excessive pollen?

17:31.637 --> 17:35.141
-No, no.
It was for my own interest.
-Are you a gardener?

17:35.224 --> 17:37.268
No.

17:37.352 --> 17:40.229
These roses are
unique to Glenbogle.

17:40.313 --> 17:44.650
There's quite a history
attached to them, actually.
Very romantic.

17:44.734 --> 17:47.152
I'm aware of that.

17:47.236 --> 17:50.990
If you'll excuse me,
I'll bid you good night.

17:59.248 --> 18:01.792
Ta-da!

18:01.876 --> 18:05.755
Look what I made you.
It a divorce cake.
I binned the groom.

18:05.838 --> 18:08.341
That's great.

18:08.424 --> 18:10.092
Will you put that down?

18:10.176 --> 18:11.636
This is supposed to
be a celebration.

18:11.719 --> 18:13.680
But I've got this
inspection tomorrow.

18:13.763 --> 18:17.558
Well, that is tomorrow.
Whereas, right now,

18:17.642 --> 18:21.646
we have champoo, we have cake

18:22.855 --> 18:26.192
and we have Russell Crowe.

18:26.275 --> 18:30.655
So can we please just
start enjoying ourselves?
Here. Cheers.

18:35.827 --> 18:38.162
Your sort of man,
is he? Russell?

18:38.246 --> 18:40.206
Right now,
any sort of man would do.

18:42.125 --> 18:46.295
-Duncan?
-No. He's like a wee brother.

18:46.379 --> 18:49.215
You must have
thought about Archie.

18:49.298 --> 18:52.677
-What about you and Archie?
-Mmm, not a chance.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.264
-Come on.
You're a free woman now.
-So why would I want a man?

18:56.347 --> 19:01.185
It's taken me years to
get rid of the last one.
Anyway, I asked you first.

19:01.269 --> 19:05.273
Mmm. Given half a chance,
but he never does.

19:05.356 --> 19:07.400
Well, you gotta
make your own chances.

19:07.483 --> 19:10.737
If you want Archie,
he's not gonna
make the running.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.697
He doesn't know how.

19:17.660 --> 19:20.204
-Your friend, Alain.
-Yes.

19:20.288 --> 19:21.956
It's a pity he
couldn't be here.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.543
-Is he working in Edinburgh?
-Not really.

19:25.626 --> 19:27.253
Oh, what happened?

19:27.337 --> 19:30.840
-Nothing to do with me, is it?
-No, it's me.

19:30.923 --> 19:36.012
I've been with Alain for five
years and now he brings
me to Edinburgh,

19:36.095 --> 19:38.348
and we stay in a lovely hotel.

19:38.431 --> 19:40.850
And on Saturday
it was my birthday,

19:40.933 --> 19:45.313
so we go to a beautiful
restaurant, you know,
candles on the table

19:45.396 --> 19:47.815
and a view of the castle.

19:47.899 --> 19:52.153
-And what do you think?
-He asked you to marry him.

19:53.071 --> 19:54.530
No.

19:54.614 --> 19:59.035
-He talked about football.
-What team does he support?

19:59.118 --> 20:03.539
He talked about football
because he didn't want
to ask me to marry him.

20:03.623 --> 20:07.877
Duncan, because of your
letters, I always dreamed of
coming to Scotland.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.546
It's so beautiful,
so romantic.

20:10.630 --> 20:14.467
Alain had arranged this
trip as a surprise for me

20:14.550 --> 20:17.345
and I knew where
it was leading to.

20:17.428 --> 20:20.056
Perhaps he was nervous.
I mean,
it's a big thing, isn't it?

20:20.139 --> 20:23.226
-But I saw the ring,
it was in his suitcase.
-Well, there you go.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.978
-He was going to ask you.
-That's the point.

20:26.062 --> 20:30.108
I asked him why
he didn't give me
the ring and he said...

20:30.191 --> 20:33.778
-He said that he
changed his mind.
-He must be mad.

20:33.861 --> 20:37.448
-I mean, why would he
do a thing like that?
-I don't know.

20:37.532 --> 20:43.079
He just said all I could talk
about now was dresses and
invitations and churches,

20:43.162 --> 20:46.249
and I didn't know
how to have fun any
more and I'd changed.

20:46.332 --> 20:50.712
I didn't know what to say.
I just started crying.

20:50.795 --> 20:56.300
I couldn't stay with Alain
after that and I didn't want
to go home alone.

20:56.384 --> 20:59.178
I knew if I came here
you'd understand.

20:59.262 --> 21:01.264
Well,
you did the right thing.

21:02.181 --> 21:04.726
Stay as long as you like.

21:06.477 --> 21:10.189
Although I do think
you ought to phone Alain.

21:10.273 --> 21:12.483
He's bound to be
worried about you.

21:12.567 --> 21:17.238
-I know I would be.
-Oh, but,
Duncan, you're different.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.950
I wish Alain was
a bit more like you.

21:23.911 --> 21:25.830
Good night, Duncan.

(EXCLAIMING) All on your own?

21:40.720 --> 21:43.222

getting used to this.

-Mmm?

21:50.271 --> 21:52.565
-Can I ask you something?
-Ah, no chance.

you'll be getting in bed.

No, it's about Marie-Helene.

22:01.366 --> 22:04.494

22:04.577 --> 22:09.957

boyfriend and, well, it
wouldn't be right for me to,

22:10.041 --> 22:12.710
you know, take advantage.

22:12.794 --> 22:15.755
Oh, so you do fancy her.

22:15.838 --> 22:19.759
It's more than that.
I've never met
anyone like her.

22:19.842 --> 22:23.096
-What, French, you mean?
-No.

22:23.179 --> 22:27.475
-I mean beautiful
and kind and funny.
-Oh, thanks.

22:28.267 --> 22:30.978
What I mean is...

22:31.062 --> 22:35.358
She could be the one for me.
The one I've always
dreamed of finding.

22:36.943 --> 22:39.028
Then go for it, wee man.

22:40.279 --> 22:44.242
-It wouldn't be fair.
-Well, life isn't fair.

22:44.325 --> 22:47.495
Else I wouldn't be
fetching you breakfast in bed.

22:51.833 --> 22:54.252
-All ready?
-Yeah, I think so.

-Adequate.

tripped one of the detectors
with my blowtorch.

31:02.281 --> 31:05.535
You can all come back in now.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.043
Great.

31:14.127 --> 31:15.795
In the course
of my inspection,

31:15.878 --> 31:19.674
I have found no fewer
than 73 contraventions

31:19.757 --> 31:21.676
of Health and
Safety Regulations.

31:21.759 --> 31:23.678
That doesn't include the
failure to ensure

31:23.761 --> 31:26.973
the house was evacuated
during the fire alert.

31:27.056 --> 31:31.561
-I shall not require
the premises to close down...
-Thank you.

31:31.644 --> 31:34.063
...until tomorrow am.

31:34.147 --> 31:37.567
I then recommend
that Glenbogle House
should remain closed

31:37.650 --> 31:41.738
until all improvements,
as listed, have been made.

31:41.821 --> 31:47.285
Finally, I should strongly
suggest that you dismiss your
Head Ranger forthwith.

31:47.368 --> 31:51.039
However admirable
your equal-opportunities
policies may be

31:51.122 --> 31:53.458
in regard to his
mental health issues,

31:53.541 --> 31:58.838
he would appear to be
not only incompetent,
but positively dangerous.

31:58.921 --> 32:03.092
That's the summary of my
findings. You'll have my
full report tomorrow.

32:03.926 --> 32:05.345
Thank you.

32:23.946 --> 32:27.742
-Did you enjoy today?
-Oh, it was fantastic.

32:34.832 --> 32:38.628
There was something I wanted
to say to you earlier and I
think you know what it is.

32:38.711 --> 32:41.756
I know we've only been
together for a day, but,

32:41.839 --> 32:44.008
in a way, we've known
each other for years.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.886
I've always thought of
you as my best friend.

32:46.969 --> 32:51.641
But now that we've met,
you could be...
You are more than that.

32:51.724 --> 32:54.060
Marie-Helene, I love you.

32:57.230 --> 33:00.900
Oh, Duncan, you're teasing.
This is one of your jokes.

33:00.983 --> 33:03.069
No, no, no.

33:03.152 --> 33:07.115
I mean it, and I know that
you're beginning to
feel the same towards me.

33:08.741 --> 33:10.702
Duncan, I'm sorry...

33:10.785 --> 33:13.371
No, no, you don't
have to decide just now.

33:13.454 --> 33:17.667
I mean, I know I'm not
great-looking or a big genius
or anything like that,

33:17.750 --> 33:20.920
but I could look after...
I could make you happy.

33:21.004 --> 33:23.464
Duncan, I really like you.

33:23.548 --> 33:26.926
You're my friend,
my best friend.

33:27.010 --> 33:29.637
The one person I
could always talk to.

33:30.847 --> 33:33.433
But you're not Alain.

33:34.684 --> 33:36.436
But you said
that was all over.

33:36.519 --> 33:39.814
It might be for him,
but I still love him.

33:41.649 --> 33:43.443
I miss him so much.

33:46.487 --> 33:47.905
I'm sorry.

33:48.906 --> 33:51.659
I didn't want to hurt you.

33:51.743 --> 33:54.287
No. I'm sorry.

33:56.330 --> 33:57.707
Sorry.

34:07.508 --> 34:10.678
No,
I need to speak to him now.

34:10.762 --> 34:12.929
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

34:13.014 --> 34:16.184
-(WHISPERING) I'll come back.
-No, it's okay.
It's the lawyers.

34:16.266 --> 34:18.518
-I could be on hold all week.
-Right.

34:18.603 --> 34:22.315
-Which do you think?
This or this?
-Where are you going?

34:22.398 --> 34:27.110
Well, you said to
give it a go with Archie.
Tonight's the night.

34:27.195 --> 34:30.031
Well, he might not be
in the best of moods.

34:30.114 --> 34:33.659
Well, he might need
a shoulder to cry on.

34:33.743 --> 34:37.789
Look, I couldn't
borrow something of yours,
could I? I'm sick of these.

34:37.871 --> 34:39.248
Sure.

34:47.632 --> 34:52.261
-Oh, it's really nice.
But it's not very me.
-It's very Archie.

34:52.344 --> 34:56.474
Right, I'll give it a try.
Thanks.

34:56.556 --> 34:58.518
Wish me luck.

35:09.612 --> 35:11.322
Lexie.

35:11.406 --> 35:13.366
Were you expecting
someone more exciting?

35:13.449 --> 35:16.327
I wasn't expecting
anyone at all. Come in.

35:20.873 --> 35:22.917
I'm,
er, not disturbing you, am I?

35:23.001 --> 35:26.254
No, no,
I was just looking through
this safety report.

35:26.337 --> 35:28.256
I can't seem to
find a way around it.

35:28.339 --> 35:30.883
Stella's been on to the
lawyers and I've been
trying to pull strings,

35:30.967 --> 35:33.302
but when it comes down to it,
we have been shafted.

35:33.386 --> 35:35.555
Well, that guy came
here looking to do that.

35:35.638 --> 35:39.726
How sad does your life have
to be to end up as bitter
and twisted as he is?

35:39.809 --> 35:42.645
I am well on
the way to finding out.

35:42.729 --> 35:44.397
No, I can't blame him.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.107
It's my own fault. I make
a lousy Duncan.

35:46.189 --> 35:48.817
Well, he makes a
pretty good you.

35:48.901 --> 35:50.570
Certainly knows how
to put me in my place.

35:50.653 --> 35:54.407
-Is that what I do?
-All the time.

35:54.490 --> 35:57.701
So, now that I've traipsed
all the way over here,

35:57.785 --> 36:00.079
the least you can do
is offer me some dinner.

36:00.163 --> 36:01.414
Okay.

36:03.082 --> 36:06.336
-Is that a new dress?
-Do you like it?

36:06.419 --> 36:08.046
Yeah, you look fantastic.

36:32.570 --> 36:34.906
How are the eggs?

36:36.616 --> 36:38.409
Not bad.

36:38.493 --> 36:40.370
You should cook more often.

36:41.287 --> 36:42.914
Thanks.

36:45.083 --> 36:47.543
I'd forgotten how
much I missed all this.

36:47.627 --> 36:50.672
-Scrambled egg?
-No, this.

36:52.298 --> 36:54.967
Supper without dressing up.

36:55.051 --> 36:58.888
Without my father banging on
about El Alamein
or the 10th hole.

36:58.971 --> 37:02.308
-And your cooking.
-What's wrong with my cooking?

37:02.392 --> 37:05.478
Oh, there's nothing
wrong with your cooking.
It was, um... It was a joke.

37:05.561 --> 37:09.399
Oh, and that was a lie.

37:09.482 --> 37:12.193
No, you're welcome
to cook any time.

37:14.237 --> 37:18.324
So, are you still
nervous about this inspection?

37:18.408 --> 37:22.662
-Oh, thanks for reminding me.
-Well,
if there's anything I can do.

37:22.745 --> 37:28.334
No, you've already done
plenty. I hadn't thought about
it for at least half an hour.

37:28.418 --> 37:31.546
It's funny, being down here,
away from the house,

37:31.629 --> 37:35.550
it helps put
things into perspective.

37:35.633 --> 37:38.678
It's very easy to lose
sight of what's important.

37:40.096 --> 37:45.226
So, what's important to you?

37:45.309 --> 37:48.521
-Scrambled eggs mainly.
-Be serious.

37:50.314 --> 37:54.694
My family,
the estate, friends.

37:56.612 --> 37:59.782
-Is that enough?
-For what?

37:59.866 --> 38:03.745
To, you know, make you happy.

38:05.496 --> 38:07.040
Not really, no.

38:11.627 --> 38:14.047
What about you?

38:14.130 --> 38:18.760
The same. I mean,
I guess I want a family,

38:20.261 --> 38:22.013
kids.

38:22.096 --> 38:24.932
Well,
that does usually require
some sort of male input.

38:25.016 --> 38:28.853
Well,
you males think far too much
about your input.

38:28.936 --> 38:31.814
-What, me?
-Ow. Yes, you.

38:34.942 --> 38:39.113
Sorry, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

38:39.197 --> 38:43.951
Look, I know it's late, but I
really need to speak to Archie
about what the lawyers said.

38:44.035 --> 38:46.079
Right, yeah, um...

38:46.162 --> 38:48.581
Well, why don't I make
some coffee first? Lex?

38:49.457 --> 38:50.625
Please.

38:53.294 --> 38:54.921
That would be great, thanks.

39:05.139 --> 39:07.350
So, how's it going, then?

39:10.645 --> 39:11.854
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

39:11.938 --> 39:13.272
Mr Barr?

39:14.607 --> 39:16.234
Hello?

39:16.317 --> 39:17.652
Your trousers.

39:17.735 --> 39:19.320
Oh!

39:19.404 --> 39:23.324
I, um, I did my best,
but needlework has
never been my forte.

39:23.408 --> 39:24.826
Thank you.

39:27.120 --> 39:31.082
-Oh, is that Mrs Barr?
-Yes.

39:31.165 --> 39:33.918
That's the Glenbogle rose.

39:34.002 --> 39:38.089
-When was it you
were here before?
-A very long time ago.

39:38.172 --> 39:39.674
May I?

39:42.635 --> 39:44.721
Oh, she's a very
attractive woman.

39:44.804 --> 39:47.724
She was then,
and she still is.

39:47.807 --> 39:51.269
-Was this a special occasion?
-You could say that.

39:52.687 --> 39:54.814
It was for me anyway.

39:55.606 --> 39:57.817
Good night, Mr Barr.

40:25.053 --> 40:26.471
Duncan?

40:29.640 --> 40:31.434
Tell me.

40:33.936 --> 40:36.439
What is it about me?

40:36.522 --> 40:40.651
I always thought that
if I had a better job
or a big house or a fancy car,

40:40.735 --> 40:43.654
then I'd get a girlfriend.

40:43.738 --> 40:47.200
I'm the Laird of Glenbogle
and she's still
not interested.

40:48.284 --> 40:51.037
-What is it?
-Well, what happened?

40:53.206 --> 40:57.585
I told her how
I felt about her
and she thought it was a joke.

40:57.669 --> 41:01.005
-What's wrong with me?
-Oh, there's
nothing wrong with you.

41:01.089 --> 41:03.007
Come on, you'll find
someone else.

41:03.091 --> 41:06.094
I don't want someone else.
I want her.

41:08.596 --> 41:12.517
Well, sometimes
that just can't happen.

41:12.600 --> 41:17.146
You know, you love someone
and they just can't see it.

41:18.690 --> 41:21.484
They want other things,

41:21.567 --> 41:24.445
and other people
get in the way.

41:24.529 --> 41:27.782
-You're just saying that.
-No, I'm not.

41:28.991 --> 41:32.453
It takes two to tango.

41:32.537 --> 41:37.625
And one half falling in
love...just isn't enough.

41:41.295 --> 41:45.383
Look, tell me all about it
and we'll try and
work something out.

41:47.969 --> 41:50.805
Is that a new dress?

41:52.849 --> 41:56.519
-Do you like it?
-Yes. You look great.

42:13.036 --> 42:15.246
-Morning, lass.
-Oh, morning.

42:15.329 --> 42:17.373
You're not gonna
need that at breakfast.
I'll take it.

42:17.457 --> 42:20.126
-Oh, no, I... No, really.
-No, it's too heavy.

42:20.209 --> 42:22.337
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

42:31.763 --> 42:33.014
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:37.393 --> 42:40.938
-What are you making?
-Eggs.

42:41.022 --> 42:44.567
You should do it.
You're the expert.

42:44.650 --> 42:47.445
-It's different down here.
-I noticed.

42:49.364 --> 42:51.032
Thanks for last night.

42:53.659 --> 42:56.954
Look, um, I'm sorry it
ended the way it did,

42:58.206 --> 43:00.667
but,
you know, Stella was worried.

43:00.750 --> 43:04.128
So she should be.
Her timing's terrible.

43:07.340 --> 43:10.635
We had fun, didn't we?

43:10.718 --> 43:14.263
Sometimes I wish things
could always be
like that, just simple.

43:14.347 --> 43:18.059
Who are you calling simple?

43:18.142 --> 43:21.354
The, uh... The girl
who just broke an egg
into a mug of tea.

43:30.738 --> 43:33.783
-Is it there?
-I can't find it.

43:33.866 --> 43:36.953
Let me look. Get away.

43:43.251 --> 43:45.586
-Here it is.
-I cannae do this.

43:45.670 --> 43:48.214
Now, I'll make the call. All
you have to do is keep
Marie-Helene

43:48.297 --> 43:50.466
here for as long as you can.

43:50.550 --> 43:53.636
-Lexie's gonna help too.
-But what happens
if it doesn't work?

43:53.720 --> 43:55.805
You have to make
it work, Duncan.

43:55.888 --> 43:58.766
You have lied to that girl
in your letters and
ever since she came here,

43:58.850 --> 44:01.728
and look at the mess
both of you are in.

44:01.811 --> 44:05.106
Now you owe it to her
to do the right thing.

44:08.901 --> 44:11.404
This seems
pretty comprehensive.

44:11.487 --> 44:16.409
Congratulations, Mr Barr,
you've almost certainly
closed us down for good.

44:16.492 --> 44:18.411
Well, that's not my problem.

44:18.494 --> 44:21.164
Not until you've closed down
every business
in the Highlands

44:21.247 --> 44:23.249
and then you might find
yourself out of a job.

44:23.332 --> 44:27.128
I'd say you were in more
danger of that than me.
Good day.

44:31.215 --> 44:35.928
Ah, Mr Barr, I need to talk to
you. I was arrogant and
inexcusably rude.

44:36.012 --> 44:38.264
I also haven't
been telling the truth
about a number of things.

44:38.348 --> 44:40.975
You see, I am in fact
the Laird of Glenbogle,

44:41.059 --> 44:43.311
but I swapped jobs
with my Head Ranger
for a couple of days

44:43.394 --> 44:45.313
because his French
pen-pal had come to visit.

44:45.396 --> 44:48.232
And what
happened the other day,
the thing with the lifebelt.

44:48.316 --> 44:50.651
Well, my brother
drowned in the loch
so I get very angry

44:50.735 --> 44:52.653
if anybody suggests that
I don't care about safety.

44:52.737 --> 44:54.697
The truth is, my father had to
have an operation for piles

44:54.781 --> 44:56.032
and my mother took
the lifebelt

44:56.115 --> 44:57.784
so that he could sit on it.

44:57.867 --> 45:02.914
Mrs MacDonald told me
about your condition.
I do understand.

45:02.997 --> 45:05.416
-What condition?
-The mental health issue.

45:05.500 --> 45:09.087
-What, you think I'm crazy?
-No more so than
anyone else round here.

45:09.170 --> 45:11.255
Would you excuse me?

45:22.517 --> 45:24.227
Thank you.

45:24.310 --> 45:26.604
I want to leave as
soon as possible.

45:26.688 --> 45:28.981
Well, you have to have
a bit of breakfast first.

45:29.065 --> 45:32.819
But I don't want to see
Duncan. I can't explain.

45:32.902 --> 45:35.238
There's a train at 10:00.
I'd like to take it.

45:35.321 --> 45:38.032
Oh, don't worry 'cause
if you miss that one,
there's plenty more.

45:38.116 --> 45:40.243
Not on the timetable.

45:40.326 --> 45:43.788
Oh, well, you don't want
to go looking at that, do you?

45:43.871 --> 45:47.583
Now, come on, eat up.
We got kidneys and
kedgeree still to come.

45:48.668 --> 45:50.044
(LEXIE EXCLAIMING)

45:52.255 --> 45:53.673
And toast.

45:59.012 --> 46:02.515
It would be
easier with secateurs.

46:02.598 --> 46:06.894
-I can explain.
-No need. I know already.

46:06.978 --> 46:08.813
You were
planning a trip to Devon

46:08.896 --> 46:11.733
and you wanted to
take a bunch of
Glenbogle roses with you.

46:11.816 --> 46:13.151
How did you know that?

46:13.234 --> 46:15.528
Because we've met before,
Mr Barr.

46:15.611 --> 46:18.948
It was exactly 25
years ago in this garden.

46:19.032 --> 46:21.868
I took
the photograph of you and Mona
that you have by your bed.

46:21.951 --> 46:23.578
You know her name?

46:23.661 --> 46:27.123
It's all here in my journal.

46:27.206 --> 46:31.544
I wrote about how a young man
proposed to his girlfriend,
Mona, in our garden,

46:31.627 --> 46:33.421
during one of our open days.

46:33.504 --> 46:36.632
She told me all about it
when she asked me to
take the photograph.

46:36.716 --> 46:40.970
I guessed that you
wanted to take your Mona
a reminder of that day.

46:42.305 --> 46:44.015
Here, let me.

46:49.312 --> 46:53.149
Did you think your wife
might change her mind?
Come back to you?

46:53.232 --> 46:56.069
-Sounds pretty stupid.
-Not at all.

46:56.152 --> 47:01.574
I think it's the most
wonderful romantic gesture.
A crime of passion.

47:01.657 --> 47:05.787
-And I know how you feel.
-With respect, you don't.

47:07.413 --> 47:10.750
Mona walked out on
me without a word

47:10.833 --> 47:12.835
after 22 years.

47:14.170 --> 47:18.299
-You have no idea.
-I do. Of course I do.

47:18.383 --> 47:20.802
The same thing happened to me.

47:20.885 --> 47:23.179
My husband, Hector, he...

47:25.181 --> 47:28.810
He left me for
an upholsterer in Lossiemouth.

47:28.893 --> 47:31.729
He's probably
pumping up her cushions
as we speak.

47:31.813 --> 47:35.024
I'm sorry.
I spoke out of turn.

47:35.108 --> 47:37.110
I love my Hector, I still do.

47:37.193 --> 47:41.447
He was a colossus mentally,
physically, spiritually,
and when he left I...

47:41.531 --> 47:46.786
I couldn't cope, the house
went to rack and ruin,
the staff out of control.

47:46.869 --> 47:50.707
But Hector loves this house
and if I can
just keep it going,

47:50.790 --> 47:54.794
maybe one day he'll return
to the place where
he was truly happy.

47:57.922 --> 48:02.510
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we
were able to help one
another in some way?

48:15.898 --> 48:19.277
-Can't that wait a minute?
-No, I've gotta tell
the bank the estate's closed.

48:19.360 --> 48:24.490
There's no need to.
Mr Barr has given
us six months' grace.

48:24.574 --> 48:28.745
I simply found the words
to make him feel better.

48:28.828 --> 48:31.789
And in a way,
your father helped, too.

48:33.249 --> 48:35.585
Mother, you're a genius.

48:40.173 --> 48:41.799
When is the train?

48:41.883 --> 48:43.718
There's something
I've got to tell you
before you leave.

48:43.801 --> 48:47.347
Duncan, I already told you.
You know how I
feel about Alain.

48:48.181 --> 48:50.058
So you did.

48:50.141 --> 48:53.061
There's someone going
in the same direction as you.

48:53.144 --> 48:55.355
Someone to share
your journey home with.

49:01.569 --> 49:02.820
Alain.

49:04.614 --> 49:06.157
I phoned him.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.201
He was worried sick.

49:10.870 --> 49:12.872
You did this for me?

49:18.628 --> 49:21.631
What do I say to him?

49:21.714 --> 49:25.093
Tell him you don't care
if you get married in
a church or a kite shop,

49:25.176 --> 49:26.886
life's no fun without him.

49:28.346 --> 49:29.972
Tell him you love him.

50:07.010 --> 50:09.512
I borrowed this top,
is that okay?

50:09.595 --> 50:13.599
-No worries.
Where are you going?
-Out for a drink with Archie.

50:13.683 --> 50:17.603
Well, now we're not closing
down, we need to talk
about a business plan.

50:17.687 --> 50:18.938
In that top?

50:21.941 --> 50:23.943
Well, it's very pretty.

50:24.027 --> 50:27.196
Then you won't mind
if I come too, then?

50:32.577 --> 50:35.371
Go on then,
girl, age before beauty.
