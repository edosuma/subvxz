WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:04.805
(cheering)

00:04.838 --> 00:07.175
Those girls
can really elbow.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.011
Ohhh!

00:11.045 --> 00:13.247
Can anyone tell me
what this is?

00:16.117 --> 00:18.186
Nope.
I know what it is,
but I want you

00:18.219 --> 00:19.987
to say it first
so I know you know.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.822
It's a squash.
Squash!

00:21.855 --> 00:23.724
I cook it every Thanksgiving,
and no one eats it.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.893
Why?
Because it's disgusting.

00:27.061 --> 00:30.731
Can anyone point out
our ancestors in this painting?

00:30.764 --> 00:34.702
No, that's right, you can't --
because they're not there.

00:34.735 --> 00:38.206
Eventually, they will be
way back in this field,

00:38.239 --> 00:41.008
buried underneath
the railroad tracks

00:41.041 --> 00:43.711
that they built
with no food or water.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.883
And do you ever
ask yourself, "Why?"

00:49.917 --> 00:53.521
Why do we put ourselves through
all this holiday nonsense,

00:53.554 --> 00:56.590
through all the headaches
of visiting relatives,

00:56.624 --> 00:59.860
through all the squash?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.296
All for a day that
we have no cultural ties to.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.631
Why do we do it?

01:03.664 --> 01:05.199
Why? Why?

01:05.233 --> 01:07.535
Because that's what we do
every year. It's tradition.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.036
It's not our tradition.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.404
We don't like it.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.974
It's a lot of hard work,
and we get nothing out of it.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.144
You can't stop Thanksgiving.
It's too strong.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.312
That's like trying to stop
Fabulous Barbara.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.614
Roller derby.

01:20.648 --> 01:23.417
Louis,
I don't want to stop it.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.386
I want to capitalize on it.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.456
I want to open Cattleman's Ranch
for Thanksgiving.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.592
Really? I was kind of looking
forward to a day off.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.327
A day off spent
searching for the leaf

01:33.361 --> 01:34.462
in the dining room table?

01:34.495 --> 01:35.529
I like a mystery.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.898
Listening to my sister's husband
play the ukulele?

01:37.931 --> 01:39.300
Steve does
a great "Kokomo."

01:39.333 --> 01:41.802
Smiling through
my mother's colorful remarks

01:41.835 --> 01:43.171
about her black mailman?

01:43.204 --> 01:44.305
What time should we open?

01:44.338 --> 01:46.307
Wait --
so no family this year?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.641
We get to
keep our rooms?

01:47.675 --> 01:48.976
And sleep
in our own beds

01:49.009 --> 01:50.811
instead of in the pantry,
on rice bags?

01:50.844 --> 01:53.314
That's right.
Yes! I don't have to
wash my sheets!

01:53.347 --> 01:55.015
Oh, you still have to
wash your sheets.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.550
You don't get me.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.888
The bar at the restaurant
has a TV.

02:06.694 --> 02:10.198
We are working
on Thanksgiving!

02:14.735 --> 02:15.869
* Fresh off the boat

02:15.903 --> 02:17.605
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

02:17.638 --> 02:19.873
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

02:19.907 --> 02:21.175
* Fresh off the boat

02:21.209 --> 02:23.544
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

02:23.577 --> 02:24.878
* But I know where I'm goin'

02:24.912 --> 02:27.815
* I'm fresh off the boat

02:27.848 --> 02:29.116
(school bell rings)

02:29.149 --> 02:32.085
Okay, class, it's time to turn
in your family tree assignments.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.724
Eddie,
where's your homework?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.692
Um...I didn't do it.

02:38.726 --> 02:39.560
You didn't do it?

02:39.593 --> 02:41.061
Why?

02:41.094 --> 02:42.062
Why?!

02:42.095 --> 02:43.631
Why?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.165
Because...

02:46.334 --> 02:47.301
Why?

02:47.335 --> 02:50.170
(alarm clock ringing)

02:50.204 --> 02:53.073
Eddie!
Are you ready for school?

02:53.106 --> 02:54.508
Never been more ready
in my life.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.982
(phone beeps)
How'd your family
take the news?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.585
My mom congratulated me
on choosing work over her,

03:04.618 --> 03:06.387
and then
Connie stole the moment

03:06.420 --> 03:08.589
by claiming
her psychic predicted it all.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.524
Well, I'll start calling
the staff,

03:10.558 --> 03:12.560
see who I can ask to work
on Thursday.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.895
Ask? You don't ask.
You tell.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.330
It won't be hard
to get someone.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.731
Holiday pay is
time and a half.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.267
You tell them,
"Happy Thanksgiving.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.435
See you on Friday
at regular pay."

03:21.469 --> 03:23.070
But we'll need
extra help.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.405
That's why
we have children.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.606
We'll do a buffet.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.207
We'll prep all the food
in the morning.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.710
A couple servers
is the only staff we need.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.617
(chuckles)

03:36.650 --> 03:39.287
Well, it looks like
all we have left to do

03:39.320 --> 03:40.788
is the centerpieces.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.423
And pick up
the raffle prize.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.225
Oh! Which was
another amazing idea you had --

03:45.259 --> 03:46.927
raffling off
a fresh turkey.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.463
(doorbell rings)
Thanksgiving is built on
gamblers and hungry people.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.664
This excites both.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.933
Hey!

03:52.966 --> 03:54.935
Can I stash these pinecones
over here?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.804
I just bought them
at the French Bushel,

03:56.837 --> 03:58.872
and Marvin doesn't believe in
buying things

03:58.906 --> 04:00.240
you can find
on the ground.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.709
Don't tell that
to a truffle pig.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.711
(pinecones thud)

04:03.744 --> 04:05.579
Why is it so quiet
in here?

04:05.613 --> 04:06.947
I thought you guys
would be running around

04:06.980 --> 04:08.282
screaming at each other,

04:08.316 --> 04:09.817
getting the house
ready for guests.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.485
Uh, we're not doing that
this year.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.553
We're working.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.121
What are
you and Marvin doing?

04:14.154 --> 04:15.623
Uh, well,
we assumed that we would

04:15.656 --> 04:17.491
come over here for dinner,
like we did last year --

04:17.524 --> 04:19.726
after Marvin
and his dentist friends

04:19.760 --> 04:22.296
go on
their annual deer hunt.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.665
They call themselves
the Buck Tooth Club.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.967
Well, you and Marvin should come
to Cattleman's for dinner.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.770
It'll be just like last year,
except $6.99 a head.

04:29.803 --> 04:30.938
That sounds great.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.173
$6.99 for kids.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.075
$18.99 for adults.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.511
Oh. Sure. Okay.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.689
(doorbell rings)

04:51.559 --> 04:52.693
Principal Hunter?

04:52.726 --> 04:55.095
We have a major problem.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.598
Eddie refused to do
his family tree assignment.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.433
Why didn't you
do your homework?

04:59.467 --> 05:00.434
I had a vision.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.802
What do you mean?
What vision?

05:01.835 --> 05:03.504
When I was asleep
in bed last night,

05:03.537 --> 05:05.305
I realized
eighth grade doesn't matter.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.274
Who told you this
in your vision? A bum?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.377
As long as you don't fail,
you get into high school,

05:09.410 --> 05:11.445
and that's when grades
start to count.
(sighs)

05:11.479 --> 05:14.382
Colleges don't look at
your middle-school report cards.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.216
I'm already getting A's
in all my classes,

05:16.249 --> 05:18.852
so I can take the rest
of the year off and still pass.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.153
Oh.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.722
But what --
Is this true?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.857
Send the boy
to his room.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.893
EDDIE: No need.
I'll send myself.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.027
Thanks for the ride,
Hunter.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.162
See you at graduation.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.301
Look, let's not milk a cow
and call it butter.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.503
We all know he's right.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.805
That eighth grade
doesn't matter?
Yeah.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.007
And we all know
how much Eddie likes to talk.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.376
Do you ever ask yourself,
"Why?"

05:42.410 --> 05:44.412
Why we put ourselves through
all the hassle,

05:44.445 --> 05:45.579
through all the headaches
of homework,

05:45.613 --> 05:48.882
through all the tests --
for grades that don't matter?

05:48.916 --> 05:49.983
Why do we do it?

05:50.017 --> 05:52.019
Why? Why?

05:52.052 --> 05:54.855
(murmurs of agreement)

05:56.189 --> 05:57.725
We have a code black!

05:57.758 --> 05:59.593
The prophecy.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.397
Frankly, I'm surprised
it's taken this long

06:03.431 --> 06:04.998
for a kid
to figure it out.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.834
We can't risk this
spreading.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.935
If the truth gets out,

06:07.968 --> 06:09.603
it could bring
the whole system down.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.606
Don't worry. I will put a stop
to this right away.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.942
I hope so.

06:14.975 --> 06:18.145
The fate of lower-school
academia is in your hands.

06:20.648 --> 06:21.782
Nonsense time is over.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.283
You live in our house,
you get good grades.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.786
And you're gonna start right now
with your family tree project.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.087
Why?
It's pointless.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.222
Like Mom said, it's a lot
of hard work for nothing.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.591
I never said that.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.860
Yeah, you did --
about Thanksgiving.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.928
You know how your Thanksgiving
is Thanksgiving?

06:34.962 --> 06:36.630
My Thanksgiving
is eighth grade.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.398
Who put you up to this?

06:38.432 --> 06:39.533
Your white friends?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.602
No more white friends!
New rule!

06:41.635 --> 06:42.803
Okay, fine.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.238
Let's pretend
that grades are important

06:45.272 --> 06:48.075
and I work hard this year
and in high school and college.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.243
And then Dad dies.
Wait, what?

06:50.277 --> 06:52.312
And I take over the restaurant,
carrying on the family business.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.414
Oh. Like a legacy.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.885
No matter good grades or bad,
I end up in the same spot.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.087
Who says Cattleman's
is going to go to you?

07:00.120 --> 07:03.791
What about Emery and Evan?
The restaurant might go to them.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.726
Even better.
Give it to them.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.228
They can do all the work,
and I'll be a silent partner.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.997
When have you ever
been silent?

07:10.030 --> 07:11.264
(chuckles)
Not through "The Goonies."

07:11.298 --> 07:12.332
That's for sure.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.101
Oh, you mean
the coincidences?

07:14.134 --> 07:16.403
"We need money."
"Oh. Here's a treasure map."

07:16.436 --> 07:17.938
"We need a strong guy."

07:17.971 --> 07:20.574
"Oh, look in the ice cream
cooler! There's an ogre!"

07:20.608 --> 07:22.643
"Watch out!
There's a piano booby trap!"

07:22.676 --> 07:23.844
"Oh, wait -- I play."

07:23.877 --> 07:25.813
It's a movie!
And it's a great one!

07:25.846 --> 07:27.815
Eddie, you are not
leaving this room

07:27.848 --> 07:29.617
until you finish
your homework.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.284
That's what
I've been saying.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.253
I'll hang out in here
until ninth grade

07:33.286 --> 07:34.421
and then do my homework.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.589
Glad we agree, Mom.

07:35.623 --> 07:38.125
Dad, get on board
with me and Mom.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.530
Can you guys leave?
I'm gonna take a naked nap.

07:49.703 --> 07:50.971
Do you know
what the problem is?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.607
He's become
a lazy, entitled bum.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.608
We have a bum kid!

07:54.642 --> 07:55.543
Jessica, hold on.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.977
This is our reward

07:57.010 --> 07:59.947
after years of struggle
and self-sacrifice,

07:59.980 --> 08:01.982
trying to provide,
working on holidays!

08:02.015 --> 08:04.552
Building a legacy
that my boy wants to take over.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.453
No, see,
that's the problem!

08:06.486 --> 08:08.155
He thinks
he can just sit back

08:08.188 --> 08:10.658
and everything's going to
just be handed to him,

08:10.691 --> 08:12.893
so he doesn't
appreciate anything.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.494
Not "The Goonies."
That's for sure.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.130
(sighs)

08:17.164 --> 08:18.732
I was so careful.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.034
I was so strict.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.503
Then a video game here,
a gummy snack there.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.872
You can't blame yourself.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.306
I blame you, too.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.875
You're the one
who bought him this.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.044
What is this?

08:31.078 --> 08:32.345
(chuckles)

08:32.379 --> 08:35.482
It's an invisible dog
on a leash.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.585
Eddie doesn't realize
how lucky he has it.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.687
You know,
he has so many T-shirts,

08:39.720 --> 08:41.822
so many rap CDs,
so many sneakers.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.991
He has
four pairs of sneakers.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.659
Who is he --
Imelda Marcos?

08:45.693 --> 08:48.461
Well, maybe he just needs to be
reminded how good he has it.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.370
Hope that's not
the National Geographic

08:57.404 --> 08:58.906
Grandma claims she's in.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.674
We wanted to help out
with centerpiece ideas,

09:00.708 --> 09:01.909
so we're making
these Thanksgiving mood boards

09:01.942 --> 09:03.611
for inspiration.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.112
I like to start
with a feel,

09:05.145 --> 09:07.748
so I collected
these light-brown tones.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.550
Mine's a celebration
of maize.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.219
You know,
different types of maize,

09:12.252 --> 09:15.388
different sizes of maize,
different colors of maize,

09:15.422 --> 09:16.356
uses for maize,

09:16.389 --> 09:19.426
American maize,
plus common European maize.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.560
Welcome to my morning.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.929
That's so thoughtful
of you boys.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.230
You didn't have to do
all this.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.798
Well, we figured
we better start

09:24.832 --> 09:26.466
helping Cattleman's
any way we can.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.935
We overheard Mom say

09:27.968 --> 09:30.103
that we might have a chance
to inherit it.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.105
You guys are interested
in the restaurant, too?

09:32.139 --> 09:33.941
Of course --
under the right management,

09:33.974 --> 09:35.508
that thing could
make some money.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.913
I guess I never imagined
Cattleman's Ranch could become

09:39.947 --> 09:41.581
Cattleman's Ranch and Sons.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.952
We should put a cowboy
on the sign lassoing his boys.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.920
Cattleman's is
a ranch.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.789
The sign should be a cow
with his calves.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.758
You mean a bull.
A cow's a girl.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.225
You're a girl!

09:52.259 --> 09:54.061
Now, now, sons,
it's just my silly legacy.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.897
(chuckling)
Not worth fighting over.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.066
Who am I gonna trust
with my secret barbecue recipe?

09:59.099 --> 10:02.369
Your secret's safe with me --
as long as I don't get tickled.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.674
EDDIE:
All right, G-dubs, what tunes
should we listen to tonight?

10:06.707 --> 10:09.242
P-to-the-E-to-the-abo Bryson?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.811
Aah!
Where's my bed?!

10:12.980 --> 10:14.181
Something wrong, Eddie?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.983
Call the cops!
We've been hit!

10:16.016 --> 10:18.118
Oh, beds are for people
who work hard.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.688
You work hard,
you rest hard.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.323
You stole your son's bed
on Thanksgiving eve?

10:23.356 --> 10:26.159
Recommit yourself to school
and hard work,

10:26.193 --> 10:27.695
you get your bed back.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.264
You know what?
I don't need it.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.167
Beds are like eighth grade --
useless.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.803
I'll just sleep
on some T-shirts.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.306
(whispering) I knew he had
too many T-shirts.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.143
[ Peabo Bryson singing ]

10:43.176 --> 10:45.946
(sighs)
This is great.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.447
This is good.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.317
I think I'm too comfortable,
actually.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.152
(sighs)

10:52.185 --> 10:54.154
I need to find my damn bed!

10:55.388 --> 10:58.325
(indistinct conversations)

11:03.831 --> 11:06.366
LOUIS: You put me
in a Thanksgiving pickle.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.335
How do I sell more tickets
to other people

11:08.368 --> 11:10.637
after I just gave you
the winner?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.639
This is the winning ticket.
I can feel it.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.142
Just promise me you won't let
this free turkey change you.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.310
Don't forget about us
after you win, okay?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.646
Oh.
That's the lucky ticket.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.081
After you win,
you and that turkey

11:21.114 --> 11:22.582
should take a trip
to Vegas.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.517
(cheering)

11:33.593 --> 11:36.396
Ketchup?
Is -- Is that what you want?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.702
(chuckles) What were you doing
in the freezer?

11:42.736 --> 11:45.338
Just checking to see if my mom
hid my mattress in there.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.607
I'm so scared
of your mom.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.611
(yawns)

11:51.644 --> 11:53.680
What's wrong?

11:53.713 --> 11:54.782
Didn't sleep well?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.449
I'm good.
Just stretching my jaw muscles.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.051
Getting ready for dinner.
Oh, okay.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.620
Why don't you walk around and
remind people about the raffle?

12:00.653 --> 12:01.789
Unless you're too tired.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.290
Not tired.
Full of energy!

12:03.323 --> 12:07.627
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup! Hup!

12:07.660 --> 12:09.863
Looks like everyone's enjoying
the centerpieces.

12:09.897 --> 12:10.898
Nice job, boys.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.099
How do you know that?

12:12.132 --> 12:13.233
Huh?

12:13.266 --> 12:14.534
What did you observe?

12:14.567 --> 12:16.870
How does one enjoy
the centerpieces?

12:16.904 --> 12:18.872
Yeah, tell us.
We want to learn.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.240
Oh. Um, yeah.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.242
Uh, yeah.
I-I-I don't know.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.410
I just said
it to say something.

12:24.277 --> 12:28.748
"Motivate staff
with lies."

12:28.782 --> 12:30.984
Hey, boss?
Creamed corn's running low.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.219
Hmm. Let's see how

12:32.252 --> 12:34.254
my owners-in-training
would handle this.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.255
Boys?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.257
Let's open up
two big cans.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.226
EVAN:
But only bring out one.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.261
Keep the other in the back
in case we don't need it.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.562
We can reuse it tomorrow.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.831
Ah.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.333
Naturals. Don't know
where they got it from.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.568
(Nancy chuckles)

12:48.601 --> 12:50.737
Owners-in-training?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.173
Oh, no, we're screwed!

12:53.206 --> 12:55.675
Ask my niece --
I am not good with kids.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.910
I don't know
if this makes me racist,

12:56.944 --> 12:59.446
but I did not realize
there were two of them.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.982
(cheering)
Oh, I love
Rocky and Bullwinkle!

13:10.690 --> 13:11.925
Yeah.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.460
Hm.
(chuckles)

13:13.493 --> 13:16.296
Sweetie, it's fine.
Hm.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.765
We still have a freezer full
of deer left from last year.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.934
12 years in a row,
I've iced a deer,

13:20.968 --> 13:22.635
and today --
squat, diddly.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.939
Aw, well, maybe they just kept
catching the scent of handsome

13:25.973 --> 13:26.974
and got skittish.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.341
Oh, no.

13:28.375 --> 13:32.012
I'm 30 feet up in a tree blind,
soaked in deer urine.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.447
My charm's strong,
but it's not that strong.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.783
Hey, Marvin and Honey. Make sure
to buy a raffle ticket.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.885
Blah, blah, blah.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.619
Did my mom stash my bed
at your house,

13:39.652 --> 13:41.354
like she did
with our Christmas presents?

13:41.388 --> 13:43.356
No.
Why'd she take your bed?

13:43.390 --> 13:45.825
(sighs) She's trying to force me
to care about eighth grade.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.361
(chuckles)
I remember junior high.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.963
I didn't do a lick of work.
(chuckles)

13:49.997 --> 13:51.431
Me neither.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.801
I did the work.
I want my bed back.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.369
Oh, you did
your family tree assignment?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.205
No, a different type
of work --

13:58.238 --> 14:00.307
data collection,
statistical analysis.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.143
I conducted a sociology study
to prove my theory.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.145
Please describe
your eighth-grade experience.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.147
Well, I skipped class
all the time.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.916
I had a kid
who looks a lot like you

14:08.949 --> 14:11.818
do all my schoolwork for me so
I could concentrate on football.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.054
I missed
most of my eighth grade.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.322
Was home sick with mono.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.489
And what do you do now?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.991
I'm a rich dentist.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.426
I'm your mom's
business partner.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.695
So what?
That doesn't prove anything.

14:22.729 --> 14:23.897
It's just two people.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.832
Two people
you know very well,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.035
who are very successful members
of society.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.170
Thank you for participating
in our informal survey.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.905
(Marvin chuckles)

14:31.939 --> 14:35.008
You will always have free
desserts at my establishment.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.377
Hot dog! (laughs)
Cool!

14:37.410 --> 14:39.112
Will you please
stop assuming

14:39.146 --> 14:41.348
that Cattleman's
is going to go to you?

14:41.381 --> 14:42.950
Yeah,
 we're getting Cattleman's.

14:42.983 --> 14:43.850
What?!

14:43.883 --> 14:45.118
We heard you say so
yourself.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.287
Oh, that was
just to scare Eddie.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.056
I don't want any of you boys
to get Cattleman's.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.123
I never have!

14:51.458 --> 14:52.725
Oh. I see.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.627
So, Cattleman's
is a good-enough excuse

14:54.661 --> 14:57.064
for you to get out of
Thanksgiving with your family

14:57.097 --> 14:58.798
but not good enough
for your boys.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.233
No. Louis!

15:00.267 --> 15:01.534
Louis, wait!

15:01.568 --> 15:02.970
GRANDMA: Come on!

15:12.980 --> 15:14.747
Garfield! Garfield!

15:14.781 --> 15:15.915
Garfield! Garfield!

15:21.688 --> 15:23.991
Pecan -- your favorite.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.758
Remember this when you take over
the restaurant.

15:25.792 --> 15:26.994
I'm allergic to nuts.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.929
I just saved your life.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.165
Remember that when you take over
the restaurant.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.800
You guys are
wasting your time.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.635
None of my boys
are taking over.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.405
Yes!

15:38.438 --> 15:40.307
Now I don't have to learn
either of their names.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.645
Louis. We have to
raffle off the turkey.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.846
Oh,
while we're at it,

15:46.879 --> 15:48.848
why don't we just raffle off
the whole restaurant?

15:48.881 --> 15:50.450
Because we already bought
the turkey.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.718
What's that?

15:53.853 --> 15:55.155
The dupe.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.156
What?

15:56.189 --> 15:57.524
The winning ticket.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.127
Did you rig this?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.361
You're welcome.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.130
Now we get
all the raffle money,

16:03.163 --> 16:04.998
and we can return
the prize turkey.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.333
Happy Thankskeeping.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.701
Of course you'd bring corruption
into these halls.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.271
You have no regard
for the sanctity of Cattleman's!

16:11.304 --> 16:13.773
This day's a celebration
of people who made a living

16:13.806 --> 16:15.008
by swindling the natives.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.577
I am so Thanksgiving.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.213
Hello, Pilgrims!

16:20.247 --> 16:21.614
Gobble, gobble!

16:21.648 --> 16:24.117
Hope you all saved room...
for the big raffle. (chuckles)

16:24.151 --> 16:26.186
Time to find out
who has that winning ticket!

16:26.219 --> 16:27.654
Oh, I hope it's me.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.057
(both laugh)

16:30.090 --> 16:32.725
Actually, that's a good reminder
that everyone is eligible.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.327
Okay, here we go.

16:41.501 --> 16:45.672
54712.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.744
54712?

16:51.778 --> 16:53.213
(snores)

16:53.246 --> 16:59.419
5...4...7...1...

16:59.452 --> 17:00.720
2!
(feedback)

17:00.753 --> 17:01.921
54712!

17:01.954 --> 17:04.022
Well, no one's claiming that,
so it looks like

17:04.057 --> 17:05.858
we're gonna have to
draw another number.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.394
(chuckling) Oh.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.265
Oh, come on.
I got to feed my snake.

17:12.299 --> 17:15.335
33988.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.837
(gasps)
That's me! I won!

17:17.869 --> 17:20.873
(chuckles)
Winner, winner, turkey dinner!

17:20.906 --> 17:22.275
Happy Thanksgiving,
everyone.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.542
Oh, I knew
I was gonna win.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.412
I heard two Phil Collins songs
on the radio this morning

17:25.444 --> 17:26.378
in a row.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.281
Best Thanksgiving alone ever.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.782
Uh, okay.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.818
Uh, and here's
your prize now.

17:34.087 --> 17:34.921
What's that?

17:34.954 --> 17:36.189
Your prize.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.590
I thought it was supposed to be
a fresh turkey.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.592
Right. Well,
this is as fresh as it gets.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.027
I can't put that thing
in my LeBaron.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.062
It could peck my head
while I'm driving home.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.598
Well, if you don't want it, I
can always draw another number.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.400
Or the same number
I drew before.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.368
No, I want it.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.936
It's just
that a fresh turkey

17:49.969 --> 17:52.139
means prepped and dressed --
as in oven-ready,

17:52.172 --> 17:53.506
as in dead.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.878
Aah!
It came at me!
(gobbles)

17:58.911 --> 18:01.148
How did my mother do this
three times a week?

18:01.181 --> 18:03.150
Maybe you can kill it
from the inside

18:03.183 --> 18:05.818
by crushing its dreams
with your unsupportive words.

18:05.852 --> 18:06.819
(cleaver clanks)

18:06.853 --> 18:08.655
Okay.
Why are you so upset?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.223
We have always been
on the same page

18:10.257 --> 18:12.425
about building up the restaurant
and then selling it.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.927
I know, but that was before
the boys showed interest.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.264
I like the idea
of handing something I created

18:17.297 --> 18:18.165
down to my sons.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.266
Is that so bad?

18:19.299 --> 18:20.633
They're kids.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.435
They don't know
what they want.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.771
This week, Eddie wants
to inherit the restaurant

18:24.804 --> 18:27.740
because it's convenient
for his school protest.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.142
Last week, he wanted --

18:29.176 --> 18:31.278
He wanted to invent underwear
made out of bubble wrap --

18:31.311 --> 18:33.079
right after he took
a hard fall off that bench.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.347
Exactly.

18:34.381 --> 18:38.017
Louis, this place is the reason
our boys are going to have

18:38.050 --> 18:40.753
the opportunity
to pursue their dreams --

18:40.787 --> 18:42.422
dreams they'll appreciate

18:42.455 --> 18:45.158
because they'll work hard
for them, the way you did.

18:45.192 --> 18:48.328
Doctor, president,
lawyer --

18:48.361 --> 18:51.298
whatever non-teaching jobs
they want.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.667
So, it's not
that you think this place

18:54.701 --> 18:56.269
isn't good enough for them?

18:56.303 --> 18:57.437
(chuckling) Oh.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.440
Oh, Louis, of course
I don't think this place

19:00.473 --> 19:02.041
is good enough for them,

19:02.074 --> 19:04.944
but it's not because I look down
on Cattleman's.

19:04.977 --> 19:09.216
It's just because I have
ridiculously high hopes

19:09.249 --> 19:10.383
for our boys.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.488
And that's all possible because
of what you accomplished.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.061
(gobbling)

19:22.094 --> 19:23.196
(snoring)

19:23.230 --> 19:24.864
That's my number!
I won!

19:24.897 --> 19:26.699
You can have
your bed back.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.335
What? I can?

19:28.368 --> 19:29.536
Where'd you hide it?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.003
It was in Grandma's room.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.572
You know, you really should
visit her more often.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.241
She's an interesting lady.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.216
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.351
Wait.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.553
I didn't say
I'd try hard in school again.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.221
Why are you giving me
my bed back?

19:48.255 --> 19:49.422
What can I say?

19:49.456 --> 19:52.592
I guess this holiday
just has me in a giving mood.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.728
In fact, all meals are
on the house today!

19:55.762 --> 19:57.397
Happy Thanksgiving!

19:57.430 --> 19:58.865
(cheering)

19:58.898 --> 20:00.199
What are you doing?!

20:00.233 --> 20:02.935
You just gave away your entire
Thanksgiving profits!

20:02.969 --> 20:05.238
And I won't stop there.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.539
That's right.

20:06.573 --> 20:10.076
I'll drive your father's dream
straight into the ground

20:10.109 --> 20:12.612
if it motivates you
to get A's again.

20:12.645 --> 20:16.182
Ohh. You thought I just had a
little holiday change of heart?

20:16.215 --> 20:17.550
No.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.552
Your mom's just...

20:19.586 --> 20:20.887
a little crazy.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.457
Loco.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.203
So, it started with N.W.A.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.572
Then Eazy-E and Ruthless Records
branched off

20:39.606 --> 20:42.208
with B.G. Knocc Out, Dresta,
and The D.O.C.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.544
MC Ren and DJ Yella's lines
don't go anywhere,

20:44.577 --> 20:46.946
and I'm not sure
who this Arabian Prince guy is.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.549
Now, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube
are a different story.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.218
Cube formed the whole
Lench Mob crew family --

20:52.251 --> 20:54.921
Da Lench Mob,
Del the Funky Homosapien --

20:54.954 --> 20:57.624
Ice Cube's cousin and a member
of the Hieroglyphics --

20:57.657 --> 20:59.826
Dub C and Mack 10
of Westside Connection,

20:59.859 --> 21:00.993
and DJ Pooh.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.829
Heh. Pooh.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.131
Now, Dre gave birth
to 213's Snoop Dogg,

21:05.164 --> 21:07.767
which led to The Lady of Rage,
Tha Dogg Pound --

21:07.800 --> 21:11.103
Daz and Kurupt --
Warren G, Dr. Dre's stepbrother,

21:11.137 --> 21:14.507
and Nate Dogg, who is
in no relation to Snoop Dogg,

21:14.541 --> 21:16.476
but he's like
everyone's adopted brother

21:16.509 --> 21:18.244
because they can't
sing a refrain without him.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.347
There's so many Doggs.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.082
And that's it.
That's my family tree.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.250
(sighs)

21:24.283 --> 21:25.952
Ah, good enough.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.126
