WEBVTT

00:10.967 --> 00:12.838
Bro!

00:12.969 --> 00:16.320
This steakhouse for my bachelor
party tonight? Amazing!

00:16.451 --> 00:18.540
We got a bourbon tasting,
cigar lounge.

00:18.670 --> 00:21.325
I'm telling y'all,
this is the kind of place where

00:21.456 --> 00:24.894
there's a dude in the men's
room with mints and cologne.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.765
Okay, well,
I better take some small bills,

00:26.896 --> 00:30.160
because I don't want to pay
five dollars for a Tic Tac.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.208
Have fun with
your meats and cigars.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.993
Us ladies will be right here
having cocktails and massages.

00:38.342 --> 00:41.606
Well, all right, girls,
get your ladies' night on.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.740
And enjoy these nights
while you can, Necie.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.916
Once you have babies,
those nights are far and few.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.484
Oh, yeah, that's true.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.747
Making you boys was fun as hell.

00:52.965 --> 00:57.274
But raising y'all, now, that's
been an exhausting ordeal.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.975
What are we
supposed to say to that?

01:03.106 --> 01:06.022
Just internalize it.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.982
Marty, you haven't told
your parents we decided

01:10.113 --> 01:10.940
not to have kids?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.029
Well, not in so many words.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.075
Or any words.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.555
Come on, Marty.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.384
Look, Necie is about
to spend the entire night

01:20.515 --> 01:21.820
with a woman
who's already picked out

01:21.951 --> 01:24.388
six years' worth of
her grandkids' Easter outfits.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.564
I know. You're right.

01:26.695 --> 01:27.913
I'll tell them.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.437
Hey, you know what?

01:29.567 --> 01:31.047
Maybe they'll be so
excited about tonight,

01:31.178 --> 01:32.614
it won't even affect them.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.224
Oh, you think so?

01:34.355 --> 01:36.357
Hell nah. Barely believed it
as I said it.

01:37.836 --> 01:39.490
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:39.621 --> 01:40.926
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

01:44.060 --> 01:47.803
Well, I'm looking good,
I'm feeling good,

01:47.933 --> 01:49.587
and...

01:49.718 --> 01:51.850
and I'm smelling good.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.680
I am so excited for tonight.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.813
Yeah, about that.

01:57.943 --> 02:01.077
Please keep in mind that tonight
is supposed to be Marty's night.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.774
Yeah, of course I know that.

02:02.905 --> 02:03.949
Do you?

02:04.080 --> 02:05.081
What are you getting at?

02:05.212 --> 02:06.648
I'm just saying, you don't

02:06.778 --> 02:09.041
have a great history
at bachelor parties.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.743
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:14.873 --> 02:17.485
Dave, Kevin's bachelor party
in Cancún?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.270
Matthew's in New Orleans?

02:21.097 --> 02:22.403
Gary's bachelor party
that started

02:22.533 --> 02:24.361
in Las Vegas and ended in jail?

02:26.581 --> 02:30.672
It was a detention cell
at the Bellagio.

02:31.673 --> 02:34.850
I'm just saying, these events
bring out the worst in you.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.157
That's why your friends
gave you the nickname.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.942
Did they?
I-I don't even remember.

02:40.072 --> 02:41.378
The Douche.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.339
This is supposed to be
a nice night,

02:45.469 --> 02:47.515
not an episode of <i>Entourage.</i>

02:49.430 --> 02:53.956
I promise you,
I left that guy at the Bellagio.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.263
There will be no a-douche.

02:57.829 --> 02:58.830
What's a douche?

03:00.919 --> 03:03.052
- It's nothing. Dave, stop.
- It's a feminine hygiene...

03:04.880 --> 03:07.012
It's used to... Dave, tap out. Tap out. Tap out.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.973
Never mind. I'll just go
ask the Internet.

03:16.848 --> 03:17.936
Knock, knock.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.156
Hey.
Lookin' spiffy, Dad.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.332
Well, that settles that.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.640
Uh...

03:25.770 --> 03:28.686
Uh, can I talk
to you both for a sec?

03:28.817 --> 03:31.428
Well, can't it wait until
we're out of the bathroom?

03:31.559 --> 03:34.779
No, because I might chicken out.

03:34.910 --> 03:38.653
So, you know how Necie
and I are an unconventional,

03:38.783 --> 03:40.568
modern couple
with bold sensibilities

03:40.698 --> 03:43.092
that don't conform
to outdated norms?

03:43.223 --> 03:46.313
Is one of those outdated norms
getting to the point?

03:49.838 --> 03:54.016
So, Necie and I discussed
the idea of having kids,

03:54.146 --> 03:55.800
and...

03:55.931 --> 03:58.325
we realized
that we don't need children

03:58.455 --> 04:00.370
in our lives to feel complete.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.634
It's the decision
that we've made,

04:03.765 --> 04:05.636
and we hope
that you can respect it.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.769
You... So...

04:13.862 --> 04:15.603
Okay.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.867
So, how's that landing
on everyone? Mama?

04:18.997 --> 04:21.522
Oh, I didn't know
you were finished.

04:21.652 --> 04:24.307
Thanks for
letting us know.

04:25.743 --> 04:26.744
That's it?

04:26.875 --> 04:29.225
Oh, I do have
one more thing to say.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.488
You boys have fun tonight.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.709
We will.

04:34.839 --> 04:37.625
Uh, you too, Mama.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.931
Thanks. Thanks for being
so cool about this.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.237
All right, now. Okay.

04:43.152 --> 04:45.502
Babe, are you sure
you're good with this?

04:45.633 --> 04:48.113
Would you look at this mirror.
It is filthy.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.290
Okay, Tina, that's not
what I'm talking abo...

04:50.420 --> 04:52.292
You know, I'm gonna get my
rubber gloves and some bleach.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.556
Oh, damn.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.085
- Ooh, Calvin, listen.
- Oh, good, listen.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.695
- Let me tell you-- Oh.
- I need to, uh-- No.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.306
- Oh, sorry. No, you go.
- You go.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.307
- No, you go. Okay.
- Go, go, go. Go.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.612
Okay, um...

05:08.743 --> 05:10.527
Can you keep an eye
on Dave tonight?

05:10.658 --> 05:12.616
He's not gonna try
to rap again, is he?

05:12.747 --> 05:14.444
He might.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.925
Bachelor parties are
a trigger for him.

05:17.055 --> 05:19.014
When he gets around alcohol
and male bonding,

05:19.144 --> 05:20.755
he turns into...

05:22.017 --> 05:25.760
There's no nice way
to say this: The Douche.

05:25.890 --> 05:30.504
Huh. Okay, well,
we got bigger problems because

05:30.634 --> 05:35.509
Marty just told us that he and
Necie don't plan to have kids.

05:35.639 --> 05:38.816
Oh, my God.
How did you guys take it?

05:38.947 --> 05:41.863
Well, I was disappointed,
but I get it.

05:41.993 --> 05:42.994
But Tina?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.996
Did she scream?

05:45.127 --> 05:46.955
Ha! I wish.

05:47.085 --> 05:51.133
Tina's got three stages
of crazy before she loses it.

05:51.263 --> 05:56.051
One, she gets really quiet.
Two, she obsessively cleans.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.923
And three, she laughs at
stuff that's not even funny.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.578
Hey, girl!

06:01.709 --> 06:03.363
You ready to get
your massage on?

06:06.278 --> 06:07.584
Stage two?

06:08.846 --> 06:10.935
And hopefully we hold there.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.111
At least I know my house
is going to be spotless.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.852
Yeah.

06:14.983 --> 06:19.030
We have ants.
So many ants.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.694
Whoa, whoa.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.653
Wh-What happened to
the limo I ordered?

06:32.783 --> 06:35.133
The limo didn't
have no stripper pole.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.614
That was the point, Trey.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.137
Oh, check it out.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.792
It's about to be insane!

06:43.098 --> 06:44.882
You're welcome.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.929
Trey, this bus better be taking
us to that classy steakhouse.

06:48.059 --> 06:50.148
- It is.
- Where we are going to have

06:50.279 --> 06:51.062
a classy bourbon tasting.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.413
- Yes.
- And no strippers.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.980
Well, now I got to
make a call.

06:56.111 --> 06:58.548
Oh. Come on, man.

06:58.679 --> 07:01.856
I'll tell you, if these seats
are sticky, I'm taking an Uber.

07:03.814 --> 07:04.728
Dave, are you okay?

07:04.859 --> 07:06.730
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.254
What are you doing, man?
It's just a bus.

07:09.385 --> 07:10.560
A party bus.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.695
Oh, boy.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.701
- Hey, Necie, what's up?
- Miss Tina.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.442
This is my friend Bree.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.008
Hi. So nice to meet you.

07:24.139 --> 07:25.662
Oh, nice to meet you.
Make yourself at home.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.272
So, Necie...

07:27.403 --> 07:29.666
- Huh?
- Oh, Tina, this is
so interesting.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.929
- What?
- Did you know Bree has
some big, big news?

07:32.060 --> 07:34.497
- Mm.
- She's about to be on Broadway
and <i>In the Heights.</i>

07:34.628 --> 07:37.848
- Oh, is that right?
- Uh-huh.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.502
Anyways, Necie,
I have a question for you.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.549
Have you ever
seen a pair of boots

07:42.679 --> 07:45.073
in the store and said,
"I don't want those boots,"

07:45.203 --> 07:47.902
but later you think,
"I wish I'd bought them"?

07:48.032 --> 07:50.208
So you go back to the store,
but it's too late,

07:50.339 --> 07:52.733
the boots are gone, and now
all your friends have boots,

07:52.863 --> 07:55.126
but you're too old
to have boots? You know?

07:57.085 --> 07:58.739
I'm sorry, what is the question?

07:58.869 --> 08:00.392
Well, I was trying to ask...

08:00.523 --> 08:01.959
Okay, ready for the
first two massages.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.484
Oh, thank God. Bree,
Necie, you guys go first.

08:04.614 --> 08:07.704
Oh, I don't have to go... No, go, go, go, go.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.927
You know what?
This bus isn't so bad.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.146
Man, you know what?
It is kind of fun.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.191
Yeah, man.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.453
Whoa! Okay, then.

08:17.584 --> 08:20.412
Uh, why is this pole warm?

08:20.543 --> 08:22.893
Wait a minute.
Was it just used?

08:23.024 --> 08:24.242
No, man.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.549
The heater pole is a feature.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.639
I'm gonna need
hand sanitizer.

08:29.770 --> 08:33.164
I got you.

08:33.295 --> 08:35.210
What?

08:35.340 --> 08:37.734
This thing is full
of Jell-O shots!

08:37.865 --> 08:39.214
Oh, boy.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.390
Well, all right!

08:42.609 --> 08:44.349
What are you doing, Trey?

08:44.480 --> 08:47.962
Jell-O shots?
Are we pledging a sorority?

08:49.659 --> 08:52.444
I guess one won't hurt.
Yeah, to Marty.

08:52.575 --> 08:53.794
To Marty.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.099
All right.

08:56.187 --> 08:59.190
I think someone put
alcohol liquor in these.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.760
You know, things went
so well with Mom and Dad,

09:03.891 --> 09:06.371
I'm actually in a
Jell-O shots mood.

09:06.502 --> 09:09.461
Hey, Dave? Dave, I thought
we agreed to one shot.

09:09.592 --> 09:12.552
Yes, one green shot.
These are purple.

09:12.682 --> 09:15.772
This must be Jell-O, because
jam don't shake like that!

09:15.903 --> 09:17.078
- Let's go, boys!
- Hey...

09:22.257 --> 09:24.476
Marty, I didn't think
this night could get any better.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.871
But there's a Snorlax
in this room.

09:29.612 --> 09:32.876
Okay, okay, use your lucky
Poké Ball to catch them,

09:33.007 --> 09:34.835
but don't let my brother
see what you're doing.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.011
- Hey, what's up?
- Whoa! Uh...

09:37.141 --> 09:39.056
Looking at sports!

09:39.187 --> 09:41.363
- Sports.
- Sports.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.844
Okay. Yeah.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.848
Ah, what a night.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.937
Out on the town
with my boys,

09:50.067 --> 09:53.549
enjoying steaks,
whiskey and cigars.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.421
Manly men manning it up.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.992
Daddy! Help me,
it's in my lungs!

10:03.167 --> 10:04.342
Boy, it's not even lit.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.432
But it's about to be!

10:13.569 --> 10:15.876
Marty, your friend is so cool.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.881
Gentlemen, who here has
done a bourbon tasting before?

10:21.011 --> 10:24.841
Oh, uh, Montez and I
are familiar.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.452
M-Montez, where are you at?
Hey, Montez.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.369
Dave, Dave, would you
calm down, man?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.458
Hmm. Uh-oh.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.199
Dad's mad.

10:36.548 --> 10:40.509
Now, the reason we use snifters
is: it concentrates the nose.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.467
And if you give it
a little swirl...

10:42.598 --> 10:43.860
Mmm!

10:47.647 --> 10:49.910
My tummy is a-toasty.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.522
Maybe I should just go ahead
and take your dinner orders.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.132
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ooh, I got you.

10:55.263 --> 10:59.093
Simone, tomahawk steaks
all around. Rare.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.138
Still mooin'.
Derek, can I get a moo?

11:01.269 --> 11:02.226
Moo!

11:02.357 --> 11:03.793
Yeah, Derek!

11:03.924 --> 11:06.056
Uh, no, no, no. No mooing.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.406
Simone, I don't want
my steak rare.

11:08.537 --> 11:09.625
I want it well-done.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.714
All right?
No mooing at all.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.455
Dead.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.588
Only thing red I want to see
on my plate is ketchup.

11:18.329 --> 11:21.898
Dudes, what are we doing?

11:22.029 --> 11:24.205
Marty is about to get married,
and we're just sitting here

11:24.335 --> 11:26.207
like a bunch of babies
at a baby shower.

11:27.774 --> 11:28.992
What?

11:34.998 --> 11:36.870
What is going on?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.436
Trey, is there a club
in the back?

11:38.567 --> 11:40.177
Oh, my God.

11:40.308 --> 11:41.788
I'm just as shocked
as you are.

11:44.486 --> 11:47.619
The bachelor party gods
have spoken.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.317
And they have said,

11:49.447 --> 11:51.014
"Let it be lit."

11:52.146 --> 11:53.451
No, no, Dave, Dave... Dave, Dave, Dave...

11:54.148 --> 11:55.410
And so it was!

11:57.064 --> 11:58.108
Trey, don't. No, no.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.588
Okay. Listen, guys,

11:59.719 --> 12:00.894
I got to go in there
and get them.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.417
I promised Gemma
that I wouldn't let Dave

12:02.547 --> 12:05.072
go off the deep end.
I got to go get him.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.905
Yo, it's been a minute
since Dad was in a club.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.472
Well, don't worry about Pops.
He can handle himself.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.911
Uh-uh, no, no, no.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.087
He's on his own.
The Douche is loose.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.006
So, Bree seems nice.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.659
Who?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.792
Necie's friend.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.012
Oh, yeah, yeah. Great, great.

12:32.142 --> 12:35.755
Oh, you know,
I bet if we went to New York,

12:35.885 --> 12:37.800
she could get us house seats
to <i>In the Heights.</i>

12:37.931 --> 12:40.368
Oh, that'd be so fun, right?

12:40.498 --> 12:42.762
I haven't been to New York
since high school.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.111
Mmm.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.287
Not to brag,
but I was in Model UN.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.203
I represented
the country of Cameroon.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.295
Tina?

12:56.210 --> 12:57.820
Oh, crap.

12:58.821 --> 13:01.693
Isn't this great, Bree?

13:01.824 --> 13:04.435
I can't remember
the last time I had a massage.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.003
Oh, yeah.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.747
You know, you should
treat yourself more often.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.357
Miss Tina?

13:13.488 --> 13:17.535
I'm so glad we're
going to have a chance to chat.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.459
You know what?
I'd like to propose a toast.

13:33.551 --> 13:36.990
Dudes, you have got
to come in there.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.602
Dave, where'd you
get the tiara?

13:40.732 --> 13:42.734
Hmm? Oh, it's a crown.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.998
I'm royalty in there.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.044
Derek, come on.

13:48.175 --> 13:49.741
Okay, but don't lose me.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.832
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, guys, guys, guys, come on.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.703
Come on. Look,
sit down. Okay?

13:54.834 --> 13:58.315
Wait, look. My pops is trying
to give a speech. Come on, Dave.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.187
You're right. Sorry.

14:00.317 --> 14:01.884
Uh, Derek, sit down.

14:02.015 --> 14:05.583
Show a little respect.
Calvin, the floor is yours.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.498
Thank you, Dave.

14:07.629 --> 14:11.851
Uh, I'd like to propose
a toast to my son Marty.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.461
Hey.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.724
I mean, it seems like
only yesterday I was holding you

14:15.855 --> 14:17.813
in my arms
for the very first time.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.424
Next thing you know,
you were a little kid

14:20.555 --> 14:22.426
on my shoulders at the zoo,

14:22.557 --> 14:25.777
just going on and on
with your penguin facts

14:25.908 --> 14:28.345
while your snow cone
dripped on my head.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.306
But I just let it drip
because I never

14:32.436 --> 14:34.656
wanted you to stop
telling me things.

14:36.092 --> 14:39.095
The amount of joy that you
and Malcolm have given me,

14:39.226 --> 14:41.141
it's just been amazing.

14:41.271 --> 14:43.926
The Christmas mornings,
the school projects,

14:44.057 --> 14:45.841
even the broken arms.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.368
I wouldn't change one minute
of it for anything.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.197
Now you're getting married.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.332
That means I got to let you go.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.769
So...

15:00.900 --> 15:02.553
To my baby boy Marty.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.468
I love you, son.
I love you, man.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.862
Ah...

15:08.603 --> 15:09.909
I want babies!

15:14.043 --> 15:17.481
I want snow cone juice
to drip on my head.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.396
I want babies so bad.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.228
Mmm.

15:25.359 --> 15:26.926
What's that scent?

15:27.056 --> 15:28.797
Huh, I think it's lavender.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.105
Ooh, I think you're right.

15:33.323 --> 15:36.936
While we're on the subject...

15:37.066 --> 15:38.372
Why do you hate kids?

15:39.764 --> 15:41.549
What? I love kids.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.768
I'm godmother
to both of Bree's kids.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.814
Who the hell is Bree?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.643
The woman you kicked off
the massage table.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.253
Oh.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.995
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
th-the one from <i>Hamilton.</i>

15:55.302 --> 15:59.349
I mean, what is it?
Is it about your career?

15:59.480 --> 16:01.047
Traveling?

16:01.177 --> 16:03.571
Do you have a bad relationship
with your mother?

16:05.486 --> 16:06.574
I love my mother.

16:06.704 --> 16:10.012
I think we'll
take a five.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.843
Is it your body?
Because...

16:14.974 --> 16:16.758
I can carry the baby.

16:17.889 --> 16:21.241
My doctor says I have the uterus
of a 24-year-old.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.421
Miss Tina...

16:27.551 --> 16:30.598
there are so many things
I want to do with my life.

16:30.728 --> 16:33.993
Being a mother just doesn't
happen to be one of them.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.389
I just don't get it.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.740
How could you not want
to be a mother?

16:42.871 --> 16:45.961
It's just who I am.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.529
How could you not want
to be a boxer?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.662
Come on now,
that's totally different.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.056
Mm, they both hurt.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.365
Tell me about it.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.845
But children, they-they bring

17:00.976 --> 17:03.370
so much laughter and-and joy.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.895
Marty brings me so much
laughter and joy.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.289
Yeah, okay,
but Marty is...

17:09.419 --> 17:10.768
We love each other,

17:10.899 --> 17:14.381
and we're happy
with the choice we've made,

17:14.511 --> 17:16.861
even if it's not the choice
you would've made.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.170
You're right.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.696
I've been putting
my dreams on you,

17:25.827 --> 17:27.089
and that's not fair.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.832
I guess I was just
a little surprised

17:30.962 --> 17:33.008
when Marty told us.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.532
He always talked
about being a dad.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.056
Really?

17:37.186 --> 17:39.493
Look around.
Look at all these toys.

17:39.623 --> 17:42.017
I've been trying to throw
these toys out for years,

17:42.148 --> 17:43.584
but Marty would
never let me.

17:43.714 --> 17:46.282
He says,
"Mom, they're classics."

17:49.677 --> 17:51.635
He wanted to save them
for his kids.

17:52.854 --> 17:57.032
I guess, um, this news
caught me a little off guard.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.905
Marty never told me that.

18:01.036 --> 18:03.865
You know,
I owe you an apology.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.303
I don't know if
you noticed, but, uh,

18:07.434 --> 18:09.392
I've been a little crazy
this evening.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.615
Will you forgive me?

18:17.661 --> 18:19.446
- No, Tina, stop.
- What?

18:19.576 --> 18:23.058
Oh, you're hugging. Phew.
As you were.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.067
Hey, uh, Marty.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.808
The things I said
in my toast...

18:33.938 --> 18:35.114
Listen, I wasn't
trying to...

18:35.244 --> 18:37.464
No, it's-it's okay, Dad.

18:37.594 --> 18:38.900
Okay.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.206
That was my favorite thing
you've ever said to me.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.338
Even though it was
Malcolm at the zoo.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.863
- Really?
- Yup.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.430
Marty hated penguins.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.432
Scared the hell out of me.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.477
They still do.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.435
But...

18:52.566 --> 18:55.351
you're still the best dad
a guy could ask for.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.136
And hearing how much
being a father

18:57.266 --> 19:00.008
meant to you,
I want that.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.053
Are you sure?

19:02.184 --> 19:03.707
Because I feel like

19:03.838 --> 19:05.883
I should've just kept
my big mouth closed.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.495
No, I'm sure.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.149
You know, I told myself
I didn't want kids,

19:10.279 --> 19:13.326
but I was lying
to myself

19:13.456 --> 19:14.936
and to Necie.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.853
So... who cried at Six Flags?

19:18.983 --> 19:20.463
That was you, right?

19:20.594 --> 19:22.944
- Yup, yup, that was me.
- Yeah.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.772
Yeah, that was
- definitely Marty.
- Okay.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.513
Remember he was scared
on the roller coaster?

19:26.643 --> 19:28.863
No, you pretended
the safety bar wouldn't latch.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.040
- And he cried, he was crying.
- He was crying.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.216
"Daddy, get me out of here."

19:34.347 --> 19:36.784
Oh, the guys are here.

19:36.914 --> 19:40.048
Derek, me, you,
Frisbee golf,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.093
next weekend. Montez,

19:42.224 --> 19:44.095
blow up my DMs, please.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.145
I see you met
The Douche.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.102
Yup.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.366
Not a fan.[sighs] Uh-uh.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.326
Ooh. Okay, babe,

19:57.457 --> 19:58.458
you are not
gonna believe this,

19:58.588 --> 20:00.764
but Necie and I
just talked, and...

20:00.895 --> 20:03.724
I'm actually okay
with them not wanting babies.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.465
Well, I got news for you.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.902
Marty actually
does want babies.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.643
He does?

20:09.773 --> 20:11.775
Hmm.

20:11.906 --> 20:15.649
Uh-oh.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.216
Necie, hey.

20:17.346 --> 20:18.521
Hey.

20:18.652 --> 20:19.914
You guys have fun?

20:20.044 --> 20:22.003
Yeah, yeah. You?

20:22.133 --> 20:24.484
Yeah, yeah.

20:24.614 --> 20:27.661
Look, I think
we should talk.

20:27.791 --> 20:30.446
Yeah, I was just about
to say the same thing.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.188
Whoa, whoa, whoa, dudes.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.538
Oh, God, here he comes.
Go in the house. Go, go, go, go.

20:35.669 --> 20:38.759
Dudes, dudes.
Where are we going?

20:38.889 --> 20:40.369
I thought we were gonna go out
and slam some waffles.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.502
Dave, come on,
let's go home.

20:42.632 --> 20:45.331
Let's go home, buddy. Come on.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.117
Hey, Derek, check this out.
This is who I'm married to.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.424
- Smokeshow.
- Okay.
