WEBVTT

00:32.324 --> 00:37.787
Last June saw Emily Davison
crushed to death

00:37.913 --> 00:39.956
beneath the hooves ofthe King's horse!

00:41.291 --> 00:43.668
Will the summer of 1914

00:43.794 --> 00:47.630
prove as fatal for the hopes ofwomen?
It cannot!

00:49.425 --> 00:52.635
This historic by-election

00:52.761 --> 00:57.306
had been a first step ofthe journey
to women's equality.

00:57.641 --> 01:01.144
Lfyou're so keen on women's rights,
let a woman speak!

01:01.228 --> 01:04.731
Why stop there? Let's get the dogs up
and listen to them bark!

01:04.815 --> 01:06.482
(ALL SHOUTING)

01:06.650 --> 01:08.234
(CROWD JEERING)

01:13.323 --> 01:16.659
- Are you all right, my lady?
- Isn't it exciting?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.662
(CROWD SHOUTING)

01:20.664 --> 01:21.914
MAN: You're an idiot!

01:21.999 --> 01:24.917
Sybil, I think it's time for Branson
to take you home.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.003
- Not yet.
- I think so.

01:27.171 --> 01:31.424
I applaud your spirit in coming, and I will
applaud your discretion when you leave.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.968
- But you agree with everything he says?
- I do, my dear.

01:34.052 --> 01:39.098
But I also know if anything happens to you,
Branson will lose his place.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.184
Better safe than sorry, my lady.

01:41.268 --> 01:46.063
...is an act of mercy? I disagree!

01:46.982 --> 01:48.816
The car's just here.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.527
Women must get the vote,
mustn't they, Branson?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.739
Why does the Prime Minister
resist the inevitable?

01:54.823 --> 01:59.118
Politicians can't often recognise the changes
that are inevitable.

02:00.829 --> 02:04.499
I hope you do go into politics.
It's a fine ambition.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.044
Ambition or dream?

02:08.378 --> 02:12.173
If I do, it's not all about women
and the vote for me,

02:12.257 --> 02:14.342
nor even freedom for Ireland.

02:14.426 --> 02:17.804
It's the gap between the aristocracy
and the poor, and...

02:17.888 --> 02:19.347
And what?

02:20.307 --> 02:24.477
I'm sorry. I don't mean to speak
against his lordship.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.854
Why not?
You obviously don't approve of him.

02:26.939 --> 02:30.817
Not as a representative
of an oppressive class.

02:30.901 --> 02:34.362
But he's a good man and a decent employer.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.615
Spoken like a true politician.

02:40.702 --> 02:44.872
What do I look like?
Could you sneak me round the back?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.500
I should hate for Papa to see me like this.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.590
MRS PATMORE: Where?
I'm not a mind-reader.

03:00.472 --> 03:04.100
Mrs Patmore is very cruel to that poor girl.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.310
Mrs Patmore is frightened.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.437
Is she right to be?

03:08.522 --> 03:12.149
Well, Doctor Clarkson has confirmed
she has cataracts.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.652
What can be done about it?

03:14.778 --> 03:17.738
There are treatments,
but even the best are uncertain.

03:17.823 --> 03:21.284
And she doesn't want to risk losing
what sight she still has.

03:21.368 --> 03:25.162
I don't blame her. But it can't go on forever.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.332
No.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.378
Oh, dear. Have you had bad news?

03:32.963 --> 03:36.841
- I shouldn't have bothered you.
- No. You weren't to know.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.269
- (EXCLAIMS)
- Blimey! Excuse me, my lady.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.105
William, will you find Anna and tell her
I've gone upstairs?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.149
Very good, my lady.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.486
- (EXCLAIMING) You clumsy clodhopper.
- Sorry.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.488
You will be sorry
when I've finished with you. Look at this!

03:59.615 --> 04:01.908
- Leave him alone.
- Anna, Lady Sybil's back from Ripon.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.869
- She's gone up to her room.
- Thank you.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.496
Why does she waste her precious time
on politics?

04:07.664 --> 04:08.706
Hear, hear.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.250
Oh, don't you believe in
rights for women, Thomas?

04:11.335 --> 04:12.501
What's it to you?

04:12.628 --> 04:15.671
Well, I know you don't believe in
rights of property.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.549
I think some people
might find that interesting.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.052
Who's going to tell them? You?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.809
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

04:29.394 --> 04:31.854
Mr Carson, are you all right?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.105
Why shouldn't I be?

04:33.190 --> 04:35.191
You've never rung the dressing gong,

04:35.317 --> 04:37.443
and Mrs Patmore's doing a souffle
for the first course.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.111
Oh, my God.

04:41.365 --> 04:45.368
Rather unlike Carson.
We'd better go straight in to dinner.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.120
I shall tell Miss O'Brien and Anna.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.458
Any more news ofthe by-election?
Mr Crawley was here earlier.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.544
He said his mother had gone
to the Liberal rally in Ripon.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.713
I heard it was quite lively.

04:58.298 --> 05:02.134
I dare say the townies will make the usual
stink when the Tory candidate's returned.

05:02.386 --> 05:06.555
I'm not sure. I heard the Liberal
was given a hard time today.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.642
Mr Branson said it was getting out of hand
when they left.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.477
Typical Branson to be there.

05:11.561 --> 05:15.064
I hope he squared it with Carson.
Who went with him?

05:15.857 --> 05:20.569
Uh... I'm not sure
anyone went with him, my lord.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.572
You just said "they". Who was with him?

05:24.366 --> 05:26.158
I'd rather not say.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.744
Bates, who was with him?

05:30.914 --> 05:32.373
Lady Sybil.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.710
Lady Sybil? Why?

05:35.794 --> 05:39.964
I should never have mentioned it, my lord.
I thought you knew.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.800
No, I did not know.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.888
I gather you went to hear
the Liberal candidate today.

05:47.973 --> 05:51.684
There were several speakers, actually.
He was the last.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.061
Did he speak well?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.397
I thought so.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.774
But there was quite a brouhaha.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.901
You know what these things can be like.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.863
I do. Which is why I am astonished

06:03.947 --> 06:07.283
you should not feel it necessary
to ask my permission to attend.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.119
- I assume this was Branson's scheme.
- No.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.330
I confess I was amused at the idea
of an Irish radical for a chauffeur,

06:13.415 --> 06:14.915
but I see now I've been naive.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.585
I told Branson to take Sybil.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.086
What are you saying?

06:19.171 --> 06:22.798
Sybil needed to go to Ripon.
I asked Branson to drive her.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.801
I thought it would be sensible.
In case there was trouble.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.013
I want to do some canvassing.
The by-election isn't far off...

06:29.097 --> 06:30.181
Canvassing?

06:30.265 --> 06:33.392
Oh, it's quite safe. You're in a group
and you knock on doors.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.853
Yes, I know what canvassing is.

06:35.937 --> 06:39.732
- I think that Sybil is...
- What? Are you canvassing, too?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.817
Or would you rather take in washing?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.862
I was only going to say
that Sybil is entitled to her opinions.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.740
No, she isn't until she is married,

06:47.824 --> 06:51.160
then her husband will tell her
what her opinions are.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.163
- Oh, Granny.
- I knew you wouldn't approve.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.000
Which, presumably, is why
you all hid your plans from me.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.799
Her ladyship will have a smacked bottom
ifshe's not careful.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.676
Hurry up. I don't want anything else
to go wrong tonight.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.096
Where's the sauce?
Doesn't this have Hollandaise?

07:10.180 --> 07:12.890
- I'll get it. I won't be ajiffy.
- Would you do that for me?

07:13.016 --> 07:15.059
I'd do anything for you.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.900
Does this mean you won't be
presented next month?

07:23.068 --> 07:25.569
Certainly not. Why should it?

07:26.196 --> 07:29.949
Well, I doubt I'd expect to curtsy
to Their Majesties in June

07:30.033 --> 07:32.743
when I'd been arrested at a riot in May.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.830
But then I'm old.
Things may be different now.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.707
She hasn't been arrested and it wasn't a riot.

07:38.834 --> 07:42.711
- But it might be next time.
- There will not be a next time.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.090
(SIGHS)

07:47.050 --> 07:50.094
Her ladyship's not best pleased
at being told off in public.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.762
William said she was looking daggers.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.849
- I'm sorry I started all this.
- Oh, it's not your fault.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.518
Anyway, he ought to be glad
he's got a daughter who cares.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.062
Her ladyship's ready to leave.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.731
I'll bring the car around.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.695
Are you pleased with yourself?

08:11.074 --> 08:12.575
Silly chump.

08:14.452 --> 08:19.081
He's nervous. He thinks
I'm planning to tell Mr Carson about the wine.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.251
Well, he shouldn't have stolen it then,
should he?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.419
No.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.256
But I don't want anyone to lose theirjob
because of me.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.010
Even Thomas?
Even after what they tried to do to you?

08:32.762 --> 08:34.221
Even then.

08:37.726 --> 08:41.020
- Your ladyship, do you have a moment?
- Ofcourse.

08:41.521 --> 08:45.024
I've received a letter, my lady,
from a friend of mine.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.109
He's valet to the Marquess of Flintshire.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.360
I don't envy him.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.447
(CHUCKLES) Lord Flintshire is a minister
at the Foreign Office.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.450
As you know,
Lady Flintshire is his lordship's cousin.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.203
Oh, ofcourse, ofcourse. The point is,

08:57.287 --> 09:00.414
he has dealings with
the Turkish Ambassador.

09:01.374 --> 09:05.794
It seems His Excellency has made him privy
to a scurrilous story

09:05.879 --> 09:10.257
concerning Lady Mary
and the late Mr Pamuk.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.843
May I read this letter?

09:24.898 --> 09:28.108
Is there anything you want me to do about it?

09:29.694 --> 09:31.278
No, thank you.

09:34.741 --> 09:39.286
Sometimes, even to deny these things
is only to throw paraffin onto the flames.

09:39.371 --> 09:42.164
- I did try to inform his lordship...
- What?

09:43.416 --> 09:46.877
But I couldn't seem to find the right moment.

09:47.545 --> 09:51.632
Quite right. Please leave his lordship to me.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.343
O'BRIEN: I'm sorry.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.931
The only sure way to get rid of a servant
is to have him or her suspected ofstealing.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.058
Aren't you forgetting we've tried that
and it didn't work?

10:01.142 --> 10:03.185
But last time we invented a theft.

10:03.270 --> 10:07.022
What we need to do is to make him a suspect
when something's really been stolen.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.732
How do we know anything's been stolen?

10:08.817 --> 10:11.485
Because you stole it, you noodle.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.487
- Oh. You mean the wine.
- Yeah, the wine.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.447
But that's the whole point.
Bates knows I took it.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.949
He was threatening to tell Mr Carson.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.619
Well, he can't, can he?
Not ifwe get to him first.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.917
Are you telling me you saw him
take the cellar key?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.794
Not exactly. But I saw him in here

10:28.878 --> 10:31.880
and I thought the key was swinging
on its hook.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.759
I just wondered ifyou'd noticed
if any ofthe wine was missing?

10:42.809 --> 10:46.895
I think I owe you an apology
after the way I spoke at dinner.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.649
Next time you want to treat me
like a naughty schoolgirl

10:50.734 --> 10:53.777
you might do it in private,
not in front ofthe servants.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.279
You're right. I'm sorry.

10:55.405 --> 10:59.491
Ofcourse, it gave your mother
her best evening since Christmas.

10:59.951 --> 11:03.245
Even so, we must try to keep control of Sybil.

11:03.580 --> 11:08.083
Robert, believe me,
Sybil is not your problem.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.880
We've got to support Mary this year,
when we get to London.

11:12.964 --> 11:17.092
But it's Sybil's first season.
We can't have Mary stealing her thunder.

11:17.177 --> 11:21.055
Sybil will do well enough.
It's time Mary was settled.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.599
High time.

11:25.143 --> 11:28.479
Poor old Edith.
We never seem to talk about her.

11:28.938 --> 11:33.108
I'm afraid Edith will be the one
to care for us in our old age.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.070
What a ghastly prospect.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.366
Mama? Anna said you wanted me.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.201
Look who's paid us a visit.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.162
Sir Anthony. How nice.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.874
We all thought we'd driven you away
with that horrible salty pudding.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.169
(CHUCKLING) No, indeed.
But I have been away.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.589
He's been in Austria and Germany.

11:56.174 --> 11:59.134
- How interesting.
- Interesting. And worrying.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.472
Sir Anthony is here to show you his new car.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.974
- Oh.
- I've rather taken to driving myself,

12:06.101 --> 12:09.812
and I have to keep finding destinations
to justify it.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.480
What kind ofcar is it?

12:11.606 --> 12:16.151
It's an open Rolls-Royce and I wondered
ifyou might like a spin in it.

12:16.611 --> 12:19.321
Oh, how kind. But alas, not today.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.408
I've had Diamond saddled
and he's waiting for me.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.493
You could ride this afternoon.

12:24.619 --> 12:28.497
But it's arranged now.
But thank you, Sir Anthony.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.917
Do ask me again.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.508
I don't suppose you'd take me.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.013
Ofcourse. I should be delighted.

12:48.852 --> 12:50.519
What is it that I am accused of?

12:50.645 --> 12:54.398
Oh. Nobody is accusing you of anything.

12:54.482 --> 12:59.570
But there has been a suggestion
that you were handling the cellar key,

12:59.654 --> 13:01.905
and before I take it any further

13:01.990 --> 13:05.409
I want to find ifthere's a simple explanation.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.245
Because some wine is missing.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.247
How do you know that?

13:14.502 --> 13:18.547
Right. Well, we'll leave it there for now.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.435
The Kaiser is such a mercurial figure,

13:31.519 --> 13:35.647
one minute the warlord,
the next a lovelorn poet.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.234
But a poet in need of an empire.

13:39.986 --> 13:44.031
That's very good.
"A poet in need of an empire." Yes.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.744
My late wife used to say that...

13:49.662 --> 13:52.956
- What did Lady Strallan used to say?
- Oh, never mind.

13:53.041 --> 13:57.419
- But I should like to hear it.
- Really? Would you, really?

13:59.255 --> 14:03.967
She used to say that Kaiser Bill
loved uniforms and medals

14:04.052 --> 14:06.970
but he never really connected them
with fighting.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.597
(BOTH LAUGH)

14:10.183 --> 14:14.269
- What was she like?
- Maud? Oh, she was awfully funny.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.357
Some people couldn't see it, but she was.

14:32.956 --> 14:36.250
- Is Lynch anywhere about?
- Oh, I haven't seen him, my lady.

14:36.334 --> 14:39.503
- My horse is lame.
- I could have a look at him.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.547
Do you know about horses?

14:41.631 --> 14:44.132
I looked after the horses
on me father's farm.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.135
- It was the bestjob in the world.
- Then why did you leave it?

14:47.470 --> 14:50.180
Me mother wanted me to have a chance
of bettering myself.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.848
As a second footman?

14:51.975 --> 14:54.643
It's a good place for me, my lady.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.229
Ofcourse it is. I'm sorry.

14:59.065 --> 15:03.026
She hopes, one day,
that I might be first footman,

15:03.152 --> 15:06.154
- or even get to be...
- Carson had better watch out.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.865
Stranger things happen at sea.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.912
I've seen Mr Bates with a bottle
from time to time.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.831
I must have thought he was helping you.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.500
Why would I order a valet
to help with the wine?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.670
Well, when you put it like that,
ofcourse you wouldn't.

15:21.796 --> 15:26.883
So, Mr Bates is taking wine.
And why would this be?

15:27.719 --> 15:29.177
To drink it?

15:29.637 --> 15:31.179
It's not to clean his boots.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.056
Thank you, Thomas.

15:35.518 --> 15:39.813
Daisy? Thomas says you have something
to add to this.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.607
- Well...
- You are not in any trouble,

15:41.691 --> 15:43.900
or any danger oftrouble.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.529
You remember what you saw.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.450
I may have seen him
coming out ofthe cellar.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.703
"May". Did you or didn't you?

15:57.040 --> 16:01.293
It's very hard for the girl, Mr Carson.
You're frightening her.

16:02.879 --> 16:07.299
I'm sorry. Thank you. You may go.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.648
Thank you, O'Brien.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.651
How is everything downstairs?

16:25.735 --> 16:29.571
All right, I think, my lady.
Though Mr Carson's a bit cast down.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.907
Oh? Why? What's the matter with him?

16:32.033 --> 16:34.910
He's found out something about...

16:34.994 --> 16:39.623
Well, a person he admires,
and it isn't very nice.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.294
Has he said who this person is?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.547
Who's proved a disappointment.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.008
I don't like to say, my lady.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.969
- Please do, ifyou know.
- Oh, I know.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.515
It's Mr Bates.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.726
Oh, Bates. Why? What's he done?

16:59.811 --> 17:03.897
You should ask Mr Carson, my lady.
It's not my place to tell.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.278
Papa?

17:12.448 --> 17:16.576
Can Branson drive me into Ripon
on Friday evening?

17:16.953 --> 17:20.247
I don't think so, no. Not after the last time.

17:21.916 --> 17:25.252
Oh, please.
There's a meeting of my borstal charity.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.839
I've missed two and I simply must be there.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.426
You'd have to take Mary or Edith with you.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.972
Don't make me. Those meetings are deadly
at the best oftimes,

17:37.056 --> 17:39.725
and you know what they're like
when they're bored.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.894
Why are all your causes
so steeped in gloom?

17:43.813 --> 17:46.648
Because it's the gloomy things
that need our help.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.068
Lfeverything in the garden's sunny,
why meddle?

17:50.987 --> 17:52.696
Well, I agree with that.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.949
Talking ofsunny, are you looking forward
to your coming season?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.492
I am, rather.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.166
Hello. What are you doing here?

18:04.250 --> 18:07.836
I'm in search ofyour father.
Carson thought he was outside.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.172
- He's in the library.
- Oh.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.219
What is it?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.722
Nothing much.
I've had an enquiry about one ofthe farms.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.015
Oh.

18:27.523 --> 18:31.443
So, what's new at the big house?

18:32.195 --> 18:34.279
Sybil, mainly.

18:34.363 --> 18:38.408
She's discovered politics,
which ofcourse makes Papa see red.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.286
I admire Sybil's passion, though.

18:41.579 --> 18:45.874
Ofcourse. But then I like a good argument.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.293
Papa does not.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.088
Lfyou really like an argument...

18:52.548 --> 18:55.675
- Yes?
- We should see more ofeach other.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.435
So, it's all right? I can go?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.270
(DOG WHIMPERING)

19:08.272 --> 19:11.191
- Will you be late?
- I think I'll miss dinner.

19:11.275 --> 19:15.445
Well, remember to tell Branson
to take a sandwich for himself.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.915
CORA: But who's it from?
COUNTESS: Susan Flintshire.

19:27.041 --> 19:30.460
- What does she say?
- Well, prepare for the worst.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.295
Not the first page.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.966
My poor niece never uses one word
when 20 will do.

19:36.092 --> 19:39.177
Start there. "I'm sorry..."

19:39.262 --> 19:43.098
"I'm sorry to have to tell you that Hugh
has heard a vile story

19:43.224 --> 19:45.934
"about your granddaughter Mary..."

19:47.103 --> 19:49.938
Sorry? She's thrilled.

19:52.275 --> 19:55.277
Now, first I must ask,

19:55.361 --> 19:59.531
and I want you to think carefully
before you answer.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.783
Is any ofthis true?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.080
I see.

20:08.416 --> 20:12.460
Some of it is true. How much?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.549
Oh, dear.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.467
She didn't drag him.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.635
I wondered about that.

20:20.761 --> 20:24.180
I mean, obviously Susan's
forgotten the distance

20:24.265 --> 20:27.726
between the girls' rooms
and the bachelors' corridor.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.603
She couldn't manage it alone.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.730
So how did she do it?

20:32.857 --> 20:37.277
I helped her.
She woke me up and I helped her.

20:40.031 --> 20:43.867
Well. I always thought

20:43.951 --> 20:47.871
this family might be
approaching dissolution.

20:48.456 --> 20:52.167
I didn't know dissolution
was already upon us.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.629
Does Robert know?

20:55.755 --> 20:58.006
No. And he isn't going to.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.467
Oh.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.887
Ofcourse it was terribly wrong.
It was all terribly wrong.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.180
But I didn't see what else...

21:05.264 --> 21:10.810
Please! I can't listen to your attempts
to try and justify yourself.

21:12.355 --> 21:15.106
I know this is hard for you to hear.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.693
God knows it was hard for me
to live through.

21:19.737 --> 21:22.906
But ifyou expect me to disown my daughter,

21:22.990 --> 21:25.700
I'm afraid you will be disappointed.

21:30.665 --> 21:31.998
Good day.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.257
I thought you must be out here.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.134
And you'd be right.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.599
- I know you're upset.
- Yes. I'm upset.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.894
I have been working here two years,

21:52.979 --> 21:56.231
and yet Mr Carson has no difficulty
believing the worst of me.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.275
I think he has a great deal ofdifficulty,

21:59.402 --> 22:02.654
which is why he hasn't told his lordship yet.

22:03.072 --> 22:06.282
- Can't you just explain about Thomas?
- Not now.

22:06.409 --> 22:09.244
It would sound like a false accusation.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.205
You can't take it lying down.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.791
Because you're not guilty of any wrong,

22:14.917 --> 22:17.544
and before it's over
I'm going to tell the world.

22:17.628 --> 22:22.424
Are you? I'm not sure the world is listening.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.680
Sorry. I'm a bit late tonight.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.182
Not to worry. How are you?

22:33.102 --> 22:34.769
Bearing up.

22:35.104 --> 22:38.064
This isn't the end. You mustn't give up.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.108
We'll get there.

22:40.234 --> 22:43.778
Forgive me, my lady,
but, well, you don't get it.

22:44.655 --> 22:47.240
You're brought up to think
it's all within your grasp,

22:47.324 --> 22:51.119
that ifyou want something enough,
it will come to you.

22:51.454 --> 22:53.621
But we're not like that.

22:54.331 --> 22:58.960
We don't think our dreams
are bound to come true because...

22:59.086 --> 23:01.254
Because they almost never do.

23:01.338 --> 23:04.299
Then that's why we must stick together.

23:04.467 --> 23:08.803
Your dream is my dream now.
And I'll make it come true.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.770
Why hasn't he done anything?

23:16.854 --> 23:19.189
He's had the story and the witnesses.

23:19.315 --> 23:23.443
"The witnesses"?
What do you think this is, a murder mystery?

23:24.487 --> 23:26.488
Well, Mr Bates can't accuse me now.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.656
It'll sound as if
he's trying to get his own back.

23:28.783 --> 23:32.911
If I lose my job over this,
I swear to God I'll swing for you.

23:41.003 --> 23:44.255
Is there any stale bread
you're throwing out, and some salt?

23:44.340 --> 23:45.590
Why?

23:46.008 --> 23:48.259
Well, I thought I'd make a last
hot poultice for Diamond.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.677
It'll give him a better night.

23:49.804 --> 23:53.098
You big softie. What'll Mr Lynch say?

23:53.182 --> 23:55.100
Why, he doesn't mind.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.477
He says I've got the touch.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.188
He thinks I should pack this in
and be a groom.

24:00.314 --> 24:01.981
Why don't you?

24:03.025 --> 24:06.861
My mum.
She was so excited when I came here.

24:07.822 --> 24:11.074
They're proud of me
and I'd hate to spoil that.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.493
Do you miss them?

24:16.205 --> 24:18.748
I never had that in my childhood,

24:18.833 --> 24:21.209
someone you could always trust.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.797
I trust them. They trust me.
There are no lies in our house.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.551
Thanks. That's enough.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.727
I'm glad to catch you.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.523
We have a conundrum at the hospital,
and I would value your opinion.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.691
Ofcourse.

24:44.775 --> 24:48.403
We've been treating the mother
ofyour footman, William Mason.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.779
What's the matter with her?

24:49.864 --> 24:54.450
Heart, I'm afraid. She's forbidden us
to say anything to her son.

24:54.535 --> 24:55.952
That's ridiculous.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.538
She's gone home now,
but she's still very ill.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.166
Clearly the boy should go and see her.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.750
And I assume you would have
no objections?

25:02.835 --> 25:03.877
Ofcourse not.

25:03.961 --> 25:08.798
So, do we break a patient's confidence

25:08.883 --> 25:12.218
and disobey her orders? Or not?

25:12.303 --> 25:14.888
We can't. Lfshe's forbidden it.

25:15.389 --> 25:18.266
- I must say I agree with you.
- Well, I'll tell him.

25:18.350 --> 25:22.478
No, you will not. She has rights, too.
And there are rules.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.106
I don't care a fig about rules.

25:28.777 --> 25:32.155
- Where to from here, my lady?
- SYBIL: What do you mean? We've arrived.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.781
The meeting's in one of
these buildings here?

25:33.866 --> 25:37.160
SYBIL: This is the meeting.
We're here for the counting ofthe votes.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.495
I don't understand. I thought that...

25:39.622 --> 25:40.955
Don't be silly, Branson.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.208
You didn't think
I'd miss my very first by-election?

25:43.292 --> 25:46.294
- I don't think his lordship would approve.
- Let me worry about him. (CAR HONKS)

25:46.378 --> 25:48.046
I have to park the car! Don't move.
Stay where you are!

25:48.130 --> 25:51.341
Really, Branson. I thought I gave the orders.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.011
Well, I said to...

25:55.137 --> 25:56.304
Sir Anthony Strallan.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.805
- Sir Anthony?
- Don't worry, Lady Grantham.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.641
I haven't got the date wrong.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.727
What a relief. I could hear Cora wondering
ifthe dinner would stretch.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.688
(CHUCKLES) No. I'm not really here at all.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.399
But I was driving past your gates
on the way to the Callender-Becketts,

26:08.484 --> 26:09.609
and I thought I'd take a chance.

26:09.693 --> 26:14.113
See, the thing is, I've got two tickets
for a concert in York next Friday...

26:14.198 --> 26:17.158
How nice. Although, I can't...

26:17.243 --> 26:21.162
No. I was hoping that Lady Edith
might like to accompany me.

26:21.664 --> 26:23.414
But I'd love to.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.875
Shouldn't you ask
what sort ofconcert it is?

26:26.001 --> 26:28.461
Just Hungry Hundreds stuff, mostly,
you know.

26:28.545 --> 26:32.340
Bellini, Puccini, Rossini.
I'm not up to anything complicated.

26:32.466 --> 26:33.883
I'd like that very much.

26:34.009 --> 26:38.471
Excellent. Well, it's quite a hike,
so I'll pick you up around 6:00.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.807
Lady Jervas has asked us
for a bite to eat afterwards.

26:40.891 --> 26:43.101
- Lfthat's all right with your mother?
- By all means.

26:43.185 --> 26:46.813
Well, I must run.
I hope I haven't spoiled your dinner.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.857
We may have to hire a nurse, after all.

hold it steady

from the beginning.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.495
Do these biscuits go up?

27:02.579 --> 27:05.498
- No, I put them out for the fairies.
- Oh.

27:05.582 --> 27:08.042
Ofcourse they're going up.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.460
What's wrong with you?

27:09.545 --> 27:13.965
You're always dozy, but tonight
you'd make Sleeping Beauty look alert.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.133
I was just thinking.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.844
Oh, blimey! Batten down the hatches.

27:18.387 --> 27:22.390
- I think I've let myselfdown.
- It can't be a new sensation.

The Honourable Joseph Gerald Ansty,
for the Conservative and Unionist Party,

27:41.327 --> 27:45.413
6,363 votes.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.832
Martin James Dillon,

27:47.916 --> 27:52.587
the Socialist Party, 2,741 votes.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.297
Can we call it a day, my lady?

27:54.381 --> 27:57.342
Don't be silly.
This is the moment we've come for.

27:57.426 --> 28:01.220
Trevor Andrew Morgan, the Liberal Party...

28:01.555 --> 28:04.432
This lot aren't interested in politics.
They're spoiling for a fight.

28:04.516 --> 28:08.269
...5,894 votes.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.190
I hereby declare that
the Honourable Joseph Ansty...

28:18.822 --> 28:20.656
Out you get, lads!

28:20.991 --> 28:24.660
We'll soon wipe the smile offtheir Tory,
bloody faces.

28:25.454 --> 28:29.082
...is duly elected... Is duly elected

28:29.166 --> 28:33.086
to serve as a member of Parliament...
A member of Parliament...

28:33.170 --> 28:36.339
- Sybil!
...for the Ripon constituency.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.257
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I couldn't miss this.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.468
Couldn't you? I could.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.763
BRANSON: I don't like the look ofthis,
my lady.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.934
Look, I'm on your side.
Don't cause any trouble.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.061
You have to believe me!

28:50.145 --> 28:52.313
What's your problem then, Mr La-di-da?

28:52.398 --> 28:54.148
- My problem is you.
- Oh, aye?

28:54.233 --> 28:55.817
(BOTH GRUNTING)

29:04.493 --> 29:07.537
Oh, no. Oh, please God, no!

29:12.167 --> 29:13.668
This way.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.802
I've fetched a coat.

29:22.886 --> 29:26.013
- Why? What do I need a coat for?
- I've come to fetch you, my lady.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.307
We've taken Lady Sybil to Crawley House
in the village.

29:28.392 --> 29:29.934
What's happened?

29:30.018 --> 29:32.437
I took her to Ripon for the count.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.772
She got injured in a fight.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.732
Take me there at once.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.413
My God! Oh, my darling...

29:50.539 --> 29:53.249
I didn't know what to do,
so I had Branson bring her here.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.375
Quite right.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.628
Mama would have fainted
ifshe'd seen her like this. As for Papa...

29:57.713 --> 30:01.632
This will sting a bit.
But it's stopped bleeding.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.096
Did you know she was planning this?

30:07.264 --> 30:09.849
- Ofcourse not.
- Well, what were you doing there?

30:09.933 --> 30:11.184
I was working late.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.853
I'd forgotten it was election night
or I wouldn't have stayed.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.313
I'm so grateful you did.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.648
Oh, I could wring Branson's neck.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.526
What was he thinking?
I'm afraid it'll cost him his job.

30:20.611 --> 30:24.906
No. I told him he was taking me
to a committee meeting.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.909
When he realised what it was,
he wanted to come straight back.

30:28.035 --> 30:32.121
You'll have to stick up for him,
because Papa will skin him alive.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.832
Are you feeling strong enough to go home?

30:34.917 --> 30:37.710
I think so. Lfyou'll take me.

30:46.428 --> 30:49.263
Here, wear my coat to cover the blood.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.933
You'll look more normal.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.727
Lean on me.

31:01.944 --> 31:04.111
Thank you so much for this.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.450
By the way, what happened
to William's mother?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.160
Not good, I'm afraid.

31:11.245 --> 31:13.371
She's home but she's still very weak.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.540
Another attack should finish her.

31:15.624 --> 31:16.999
And he still doesn't know?

31:17.084 --> 31:21.796
She's adamant. I've tried to explain
how hard it'll be on him,

31:21.880 --> 31:23.381
but she won't have him disturbed.

31:23.465 --> 31:27.134
To hear her talk,
you'd think he was a cabinet minister.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.387
He's made her proud.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.806
There are plenty ofchildren
in grander circumstances

31:31.890 --> 31:34.141
who'd love to say the same.

31:41.358 --> 31:44.360
I wish you'd tell me what's troubling you.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.655
If it's this business with Mr Bates...

31:47.739 --> 31:50.783
Oh, it's not that. I'll get to the bottom ofthat.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.743
Well, I hope you'll do it soon.

31:52.828 --> 31:55.663
Lfthere's one thing I hate,
it's an atmosphere.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.208
And we've got a real atmosphere going now.

31:59.293 --> 32:02.670
It's an unfair rumour
which needs to be scotched.

32:02.754 --> 32:07.717
It's very hard to hear the names of
people you love dragged in the mud.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.720
You feel so powerless.

32:10.804 --> 32:15.933
Well, I respect Mr Bates,
but I'm not sure that I love him.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.519
I wasn't thinking of Mr Bates.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.146
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

32:20.230 --> 32:21.814
Mr Carson, have you got a minute?

32:21.898 --> 32:24.567
What is it, Daisy?
Mr Carson's a very busy man.

32:24.693 --> 32:28.070
I know he is.
But I think he'll want to hear this.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.365
I told you something that wasn't true.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.492
Why would you do that?

32:33.577 --> 32:36.996
I did it as a favour for a friend.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.041
But I know now he was wrong to ask it of me.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.348
She's not badly hurt, is she?

32:55.432 --> 32:57.391
I don't think so, no.

32:58.060 --> 32:59.602
Thank God.

33:01.146 --> 33:05.399
Better be prepared.
I'm afraid Lord Grantham will hit the roof.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.403
I never would have taken her there.

33:09.613 --> 33:12.281
I may be a Socialist but I'm not a lunatic.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.201
I'm not sure Papa knows the difference.

33:17.371 --> 33:20.039
You'll let me know how she gets on?

33:22.084 --> 33:23.376
Please.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.295
Lfyou wish.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.057
How dare you?

33:38.141 --> 33:40.434
How dare you disobey me in this way?

33:40.560 --> 33:41.769
Robert, I'm sure...

33:41.895 --> 33:43.938
Are you so knowledgeable
about the great world

33:44.064 --> 33:47.066
that my instructions are to be set
as nothing?

33:47.317 --> 33:49.610
Papa, I'm sorry I disobeyed you.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.488
But I'm interested!
I'm political! I have opinions!

33:52.614 --> 33:54.949
- Ofcourse, I blame Branson.
- I don't think that's fair.

33:55.075 --> 33:58.953
We had none ofthis, none of it,
until he set foot in our house!

33:59.037 --> 34:01.956
I suppose I should give thanks he hasn't
burnt the place down over our heads!

34:02.040 --> 34:04.625
Branson didn't know anything about it
until we arrived there.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.544
He leaves tonight!

34:06.628 --> 34:09.964
Lfyou punish Branson,
I'll never speak to you again. Never!

34:10.090 --> 34:12.883
I don't believe this is Branson's fault.
Truly, Papa.

34:12.968 --> 34:14.969
- Blame me.
- I do blame you!

34:15.095 --> 34:18.806
Robert, can we do this in the morning?
Sybil needs rest.

34:18.974 --> 34:23.310
If I find tomorrow that Branson is missing,
I'll run away. I warn you.

34:23.645 --> 34:27.064
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
Oh? And where would you go?

34:27.315 --> 34:28.983
Well, I can't think now.

34:29.109 --> 34:31.777
But I will go, and you'll be sorry.

34:33.155 --> 34:34.405
(SCOFFS)

34:34.489 --> 34:37.783
I should be sorry. Very sorry, indeed.

34:41.121 --> 34:42.538
How is she?

34:42.664 --> 34:44.123
MARY: She'll be perfectly fine.

34:44.207 --> 34:46.625
I gather you're the shining knight in all this.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.878
Not really. But I'm glad I was there.

34:48.962 --> 34:52.757
So am I, by heaven. If it had been
left to that bloody fool Branson...

34:52.841 --> 34:54.008
You should see what he reads.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.428
It's all Marx and Ruskin and John Stuart Mill,
I ask you.

34:57.804 --> 35:01.932
Papa prefers the servants to read the Bible
and letters from home.

35:02.017 --> 35:05.060
There are sandwiches for Mr Crawley
in the dining room, Lady Mary.

35:05.145 --> 35:07.229
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

35:08.190 --> 35:10.524
- We couldn't let you starve.
- You really didn't have to.

35:10.609 --> 35:14.695
Mary, look after Matthew,
I'll go up and revive your mother.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.742
Do you stand by your story?

35:19.826 --> 35:21.076
I don't have a story.

35:21.161 --> 35:24.079
You saw Mr Bates in here alone,
hanging up the cellar key.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.748
To me, that is a story.

35:25.832 --> 35:29.084
I only said I might have seen him.
I suppose I was wrong.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.128
And Miss O'Brien, were you then wrong

35:31.213 --> 35:34.590
when you thought you saw Mr Bates
carrying a bottle?

35:34.674 --> 35:36.425
- You wicked creature...
- Anna.

35:36.510 --> 35:39.720
You are here to watch,
not to participate.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.264
I don't think I was wrong, no.

35:42.516 --> 35:45.059
What do you say to that, Mr Bates?

35:45.268 --> 35:48.854
I know this to be untrue
because I have no need of it.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.273
Since I arrived at Downton,

35:51.358 --> 35:54.318
you have never seen me drink
one drop of alcohol.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.988
Let us say, then,
that Miss O'Brien was mistaken.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.782
Mistaken, my eye.

35:59.866 --> 36:02.618
And, Daisy, we all know the value
ofyour contribution.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.328
Yes, Mr Carson.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.873
But I must ask one thing, Mr Bates,

36:07.958 --> 36:11.001
how did you know the wine had been taken?

36:13.463 --> 36:15.923
I'm afraid I cannot answer that.

36:17.259 --> 36:19.176
We can drink to Sybil's safe return.

36:19.261 --> 36:20.845
Why not?

36:20.929 --> 36:24.181
- I'll ring for a glass.
- Never mind that. Here.

36:27.602 --> 36:31.480
You're not very fastidious about
doing things properly, are you?

36:31.606 --> 36:32.940
Are you?

36:33.316 --> 36:35.609
Less than you might think.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.869
Are you at all political?

36:45.620 --> 36:47.496
Yes.

36:47.622 --> 36:51.792
But with a hung Parliament,
it's hard to get excited about a by-election.

36:51.877 --> 36:55.170
You know nothing will change,
whoever gets in.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.720
If I might keep you
for a minute more, Mr Carson.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.471
Lfyou'd like me to leave...

37:04.598 --> 37:08.809
No. I would like you to stay, please,
Mrs Hughes. And you, Anna.

37:09.686 --> 37:13.772
You have decided not to take action
over the allegations

37:13.857 --> 37:17.568
Thomas has made against me
because you believe them to be untrue?

37:17.652 --> 37:22.156
- That is correct.
- And you are right. There's no truth in them.

37:23.116 --> 37:27.995
But ifyou were to proceed with the matter,
you would find them to be proven.

37:28.705 --> 37:32.708
Thomas has tried to convince you
that I'm a drunkard and a thief.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.376
Which we never believed.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.879
Because you know no different.

37:37.964 --> 37:41.133
Until a couple ofyears ago, I was a drunkard.

37:42.510 --> 37:45.346
And I was imprisoned as a thief.

37:50.769 --> 37:55.522
I have repaid your kindness very poorly.

37:57.150 --> 38:01.612
I masqueraded as a man
of honour and integrity,

38:02.530 --> 38:06.367
but by any moral code, I am disgraced.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.371
That can't be the whole story.

38:11.831 --> 38:17.711
Perhaps not. But it's enough of it
to demand my resignation.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.799
Do you want to leave, Mr Bates?

38:21.883 --> 38:24.551
No. But I feel I have no choice.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.389
You owe me a say in the matter, surely?

38:28.598 --> 38:30.057
Lfyou wish.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.227
Then I will consider the case
and give you my decision

38:33.311 --> 38:36.271
when I have discussed it with his lordship.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.400
Until then,
I hope you will remain in your post.

38:47.283 --> 38:50.202
Thank you for coming to Sybil's rescue.

38:50.412 --> 38:54.456
You were very brave.
She told me you knocked a man down.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.210
I hope did my duty.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.171
Are you a creature ofduty?

39:02.674 --> 39:04.174
Not entirely.

39:04.801 --> 39:09.263
When you laugh with me, or flirt with me,
is that a duty?

39:10.682 --> 39:13.600
Are you conforming to the fitness ofthings?

39:13.685 --> 39:15.728
Doing what's expected?

39:18.273 --> 39:20.149
Don't play with me.

39:21.609 --> 39:24.653
I don't deserve it. Not from you.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.950
You must be careful
not to break Sybil's heart.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.661
I think she has a crush on you.

39:32.954 --> 39:35.581
That's something
no one could accuse you of.

39:35.665 --> 39:37.541
Oh, I don't know.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.837
I assume you speak in a spirit of mockery.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.507
You should have more faith.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.471
Shall I remind you
ofsome ofthe choicest remarks

39:50.555 --> 39:53.348
you made about me when I arrived here?

39:54.142 --> 39:56.310
Because they live in my memory

39:57.645 --> 40:00.272
as fresh as the day they were spoken.

40:00.356 --> 40:03.400
Oh, Matthew. What am I always telling you?

40:04.194 --> 40:07.404
You must pay no attention
to the things I say.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.219
- Mr Bates.
- Anna.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.182
Will you really leave?

40:36.017 --> 40:39.353
I doubt his lordship wants a thief
in the house.

40:42.023 --> 40:46.193
- Now go to sleep and dream of a better man.
- I can't.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.364
Because there isn't one.

41:04.754 --> 41:07.005
(DOOR OPENING)

41:07.423 --> 41:09.216
(BOTTLES CLANKING)

41:17.225 --> 41:19.059
Has Matthew gone?

41:19.185 --> 41:22.271
- Yes.
- Thank the Lord he was there.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.986
I hope you thanked Matthew properly.

41:29.237 --> 41:32.197
I got them to make him some sandwiches.

41:32.740 --> 41:35.075
It's not quite what I meant.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.245
And he asked me to marry him.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.914
Heavens. What did they put in them?

41:40.999 --> 41:44.084
I'm serious. He proposed to me.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.046
Oh, my dear.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.509
Have you given him an answer?

41:53.011 --> 41:55.262
Only that I'd think about it.

41:55.388 --> 41:59.725
Well, that's an advance on
what it would have been a year ago.

42:01.603 --> 42:05.105
- Do you want to marry him?
- I know you want me to marry him.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.608
What we want doesn't matter.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.779
At least, it's not all that matters.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.534
Do you love Matthew?

42:19.871 --> 42:21.121
Yes.

42:22.916 --> 42:25.375
I think perhaps I do.

42:26.586 --> 42:29.838
I think I may have loved him
for much longer than I knew.

42:29.923 --> 42:31.506
Oh, my darling.

42:33.968 --> 42:38.347
Let's not pretend this isn't the answer
to every one ofour prayers.

42:40.099 --> 42:42.184
I'd have to tell him.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.478
Oh...

42:46.147 --> 42:48.023
Is it absolutely necessary?

42:48.107 --> 42:50.943
If I didn't, I'd feel as if
I'd caught him with a lie.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.694
(DOOR OPENING)

42:55.865 --> 42:59.117
I hope you know that really smart people
sleep in separate rooms.

42:59.202 --> 43:01.203
I always keep the bed made up
in the dressing room,

43:01.287 --> 43:04.164
so at least I pretend we sleep apart.
Isn't that enough?

43:04.249 --> 43:07.376
No. Never mind. Good night.

43:12.215 --> 43:13.298
Mmm.

43:13.383 --> 43:15.634
Haven't you gone up yet?

43:15.718 --> 43:18.136
Blow this out. You're the last.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.639
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.391
Good night.

43:24.852 --> 43:27.646
I'm going to bloody get him.
I don't care what you say.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.147
What would I say?

43:29.232 --> 43:31.108
Everything comes to him who waits.

43:31.192 --> 43:33.527
Well, I've waited long enough.

43:38.366 --> 43:39.950
Does Carson know you're here?

43:40.034 --> 43:42.828
I heard you were going out
and I wanted to see how he was walking.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.705
Lynch is happy for me to ride him.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.248
Oh, yes. He's better.

43:46.374 --> 43:49.793
But I'll wait and see what he's like
when you're up.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.547
William, are you planning to go home soon?

43:53.631 --> 43:55.924
Well, it's a bit far for my halfday,

43:56.050 --> 44:00.095
but I can maybe get the time to go in July
when the family's in London.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.848
That's if I don't go with you, ofcourse.

44:02.932 --> 44:05.684
I think you should take a few days off
and go now.

44:05.768 --> 44:10.147
I'll fix it. I'll speak to father and to Carson.
No one will mind.

44:10.273 --> 44:11.982
But why, my lady?

44:13.151 --> 44:15.444
Your mother's not been well.

44:16.946 --> 44:17.988
How do you know?

44:18.072 --> 44:21.241
I heard someone mention it in the village.
I forget who.

44:22.744 --> 44:26.538
- I had a letter and she never said.
- Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

44:26.622 --> 44:29.541
But I know it would cheer her to see you.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.918
Well, if it wouldn't be a bother.

44:32.378 --> 44:35.756
It won't. I'll arrange it as soon as I get back.

44:36.549 --> 44:38.884
Thank you very much, my lady.

44:40.428 --> 44:44.139
She ought to spend some time
with the people she loves.

44:45.933 --> 44:47.893
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

44:48.936 --> 44:51.438
The Dowager Countess, my lady.

44:53.149 --> 44:55.317
Good afternoon, my dear.

44:56.277 --> 44:58.278
Good afternoon.

44:58.404 --> 45:01.656
There's no need to be so prim.
I come in peace.

45:03.159 --> 45:04.951
Shall I sit here?

45:09.624 --> 45:12.376
Now, I've been thinking...

45:12.460 --> 45:17.756
I confess I do not know if I would have had
the strength, mentally or physically,

45:18.883 --> 45:22.803
to carry a corpse the length ofthis house.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.307
But I hope I would have done.

45:29.602 --> 45:31.395
You were quite right.

45:31.479 --> 45:33.230
When something bad happens,

45:33.314 --> 45:36.650
there's no point in wishing
it had not happened.

45:36.734 --> 45:40.487
The only option is to minimise the damage.

45:41.489 --> 45:45.909
Or try to.
But ifthe Flintshires have got hold of it...

45:45.993 --> 45:47.911
I've written to Susan.

45:48.663 --> 45:54.292
I said it was a story made up
by Mr Pamuk's enemies to discredit him.

45:55.670 --> 45:57.295
Even ifshe doesn't believe me,

45:57.380 --> 46:00.882
she won't tell,
in case it reflects badly on her.

46:01.634 --> 46:05.095
The Ambassador is dangerous.

46:05.179 --> 46:09.266
But then, how many people really go
to the Turkish Embassy?

46:09.725 --> 46:11.268
It only takes one.

46:11.352 --> 46:14.855
Well... I mean, thatjust can't be helped.

46:15.857 --> 46:18.233
We can't have him assassinated,

46:19.026 --> 46:20.402
I suppose.

46:21.654 --> 46:23.572
Robert still doesn't suspect.

46:23.656 --> 46:24.739
Oh, I should hope not.

46:24.824 --> 46:29.953
No, our only way forward
is to get Mary settled as soon as possible.

46:30.246 --> 46:34.416
I have news on that score.
Matthew has proposed.

46:34.500 --> 46:37.002
(GASPING) My, my. Has she said yes?

46:37.086 --> 46:41.965
She hasn't said anything yet, except that
she's going to have to tell him about Pamuk.

46:42.049 --> 46:44.259
For heaven's sake, why?

46:44.635 --> 46:47.679
She thinks to keep it secret
would be dishonourable.

46:47.763 --> 46:50.474
She reads too many novels.

46:50.558 --> 46:54.227
I mean, one way or another,
everyone goes down the aisle

46:54.312 --> 46:56.563
with halfthe story hidden.

46:56.689 --> 47:00.609
The question is, will she accept Matthew?

47:01.068 --> 47:03.236
I'm not sure.

47:03.321 --> 47:07.616
(SIGHING) Well, ifshe doesn't,
we'll just have to take her abroad.

47:07.783 --> 47:13.622
In these moments, you can normally
find an Italian who isn't too picky.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.709
We'll give her till the start ofthe grouse.

47:17.793 --> 47:23.131
Very well. Lfshe turns Matthew down,
we'll take her to Rome in the autumn.

47:23.216 --> 47:24.799
It's official.

47:26.928 --> 47:29.554
Thank you for not turning against her.

47:29.639 --> 47:30.847
I know that you have rules,

47:30.932 --> 47:34.142
and when people break them
you find it hard to forgive.

47:34.810 --> 47:38.021
I understand that and I respect it.

47:39.815 --> 47:42.609
In this case Mary has the trump card.

47:42.693 --> 47:43.985
What?

47:44.820 --> 47:46.446
Mary is family.
