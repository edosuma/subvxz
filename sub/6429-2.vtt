00:00.239 --> 00:02.335
Previously on Warehouse 13...

00:03.378 --> 00:05.379
Arthur Nielsen.
You can call me Artie.

00:05.547 --> 00:08.591
- I'm thrilled you're on the team.
- What team? What is this place?

00:08.759 --> 00:11.844
You're both joining me as fellow
gatherers and protectors of secrets.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.209
Ms. Bering, Mr. Lattimer...

00:14.509 --> 00:16.991
welcome to Warehouse 13.

00:18.132 --> 00:20.561
Can we get back to the Warehouse
computers being breached?

00:20.919 --> 00:22.730
Somebody is poking around
in your system.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.778
Warehouse 13.

00:25.276 --> 00:26.233
I got hacked.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.711 --> 01:25.873
Myka, I could use a hand down here.

01:25.998 --> 01:28.351
<i>I'm distracting the gendarmes first.
That was the plan.</i>

01:28.476 --> 01:30.790
<i>Remember?
Did you switch out the blade yet?</i>

01:30.915 --> 01:32.800
If I had, I wouldn't
be calling you, would I?

01:33.100 --> 01:34.995
Hang tight. Be there in two.

01:53.872 --> 01:56.907
- <i>Pete, time's up.</i>
- Come on. Almost there.

02:02.883 --> 02:04.248
Now I've got you.

02:33.367 --> 02:34.612
Very nice.

02:35.598 --> 02:38.641
You must be super fun on a date.
Guys love that.

02:38.766 --> 02:40.822
All kick-ass action and no talking.

02:41.269 --> 02:42.536
I switched the blade.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.081
You didn't follow the plan.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.625
Now hurry before they get up.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.460
I'm sorry. News flash.

02:49.952 --> 02:53.701
- Your plan wasn't working.
- Are you forgetting something?

02:59.613 --> 03:00.620
Let's go.

03:02.293 --> 03:04.558
I was just...
keeping you on your toes.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.936
Right. It's always my toes.
What about your toes?

03:19.065 --> 03:22.410
<i>Suicide attacks ripped through areas
in and around Baghdad today...</i>

03:23.396 --> 03:24.898
<i>In the form of protests and...</i>

03:25.023 --> 03:28.050
<i>In order to assist Hungary
in avoiding an all...</i>

04:39.710 --> 04:40.946
You gotta see this.

04:55.163 --> 04:56.521
<i>You gotta see this.</i>

05:20.737 --> 05:23.351
- Don't jump.
- Sister Grace, come down.

05:24.741 --> 05:28.054
<i>Miraculously, Sister Grace Ellen
only suffered minor injuries</i>

05:28.179 --> 05:32.387
<i>and is listed in stable condition
at a local hospital here in Unionville.</i>

05:32.958 --> 05:36.627
- <i>Adele Poro, Channel Six news.</i>
- What's going on there in Unionville?

05:37.431 --> 05:41.006
Marie Antoinette guillotine blade
bagged, tagged, and on the shelf.

05:41.369 --> 05:44.229
Congratulations, but remember
to charge the Tesla next time.

05:44.354 --> 05:46.693
Are you still going on
about the Tesla?

05:46.818 --> 05:49.932
No, Pete, what I am going on about
is protocol.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.054
I mean, you do know
how to read, don't you?

05:52.179 --> 05:54.410
You know when you frown,
that premature wrinkle line

05:54.535 --> 05:56.271
in your forehead
gets more prominent.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.775
- <i>You just hate it when I'm right.
- Thank God that never happens.</i>

06:01.528 --> 06:03.696
- You know what I don't get about you?
- Guys?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.284
- How I wake up looking this good?
- No, no, Pete.

06:06.409 --> 06:10.317
What I don't get is your pathological
need to ignore authority.

06:10.442 --> 06:11.745
<i>Guys? Guys?</i>

06:11.870 --> 06:13.945
- You were not in charge in Paris.
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

06:14.070 --> 06:16.000
- Neither were you.
- Better than you.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.634
- <i>What is that? You are like a child.</i>
- Watch...

06:19.265 --> 06:21.171
your negative energy.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.717
- You're like an uptight control freak.
- <i>The Warehouse will do bad things.</i>

06:25.325 --> 06:27.594
No, no, no. Don't do it.
Don't you do it.

06:27.719 --> 06:28.879
Miss community college?

06:34.362 --> 06:36.500
Hey, kids, bring your sleeping bags.

06:37.506 --> 06:39.439
Who asked you to be my mother?

06:39.564 --> 06:41.984
Okay, what about your parents?
I bet you were a real...

06:42.152 --> 06:44.862
I suggest you close your eyes.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.905
<i>Look out, there's a nerve.</i>

06:47.073 --> 06:49.783
Look, I don't know
what's going on there, but you just...

06:56.663 --> 06:58.375
Had to be done.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.807
Projet-SG (1.00)

07:55.225 --> 07:57.514
You know, it's gonna have
who-knows-what consequences,

07:57.639 --> 08:01.491
and as I keep telling you repeatedly,
all things have a magnetic context,

08:01.616 --> 08:03.391
especially things in that Warehouse.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.281
You cannot go into that place
with so much negative energy.

08:06.406 --> 08:09.012
You wanna fight with her?
Fine. Fight with her, but not there.

08:09.137 --> 08:11.907
One of us has to be in charge
out in the field. Don't you think?

08:12.584 --> 08:14.850
You haven't listened
to a word I've said, have you?

08:15.745 --> 08:19.747
I'm just saying somebody leads,
somebody follows, right?

08:19.872 --> 08:22.505
You know, I have more experience,
more know-how.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.441
I'm more grounded.

08:24.566 --> 08:26.463
Pete, you're the obvious
choice here.

08:27.024 --> 08:29.049
Listen. Do me a favor, will you?

08:29.217 --> 08:31.348
You let Myka think
that she's running things,

08:31.473 --> 08:33.511
because really,
she's very, very sensitive.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.986
Sometimes I just wanna punch him.
He reminds me of my father.

08:38.111 --> 08:41.227
- You know, he's arrogant.
- I think he's kind of sexy.

08:41.397 --> 08:43.230
- So not my type.
- Really?

08:43.813 --> 08:47.396
- What's your type?
- I don't know. Opposable thumbs maybe?

08:47.521 --> 08:48.777
Hello, ladies.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.572
We're not interrupting
girl talk are we?

08:51.740 --> 08:53.448
Like now.
I could punch him right now.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.402
All right, game time.
Come on. Come on.

08:58.604 --> 08:59.611
Come on!

09:03.585 --> 09:05.752
A nun, a teenager, and an old lady

09:05.920 --> 09:08.255
all acting very strangely
in Unionville, Colorado.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.983
I have research here that indicates

09:10.108 --> 09:12.050
each of these people knew
what they were doing.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.210
They couldn't stop themselves
from doing it for some reason.

09:15.335 --> 09:17.806
Could there
be a practical explanation?

09:17.931 --> 09:19.814
- Something in the water?
- Nothing. I checked.

09:20.218 --> 09:21.952
Maybe it's just a bad flu bug.

09:22.299 --> 09:25.439
Only three cases in a town of thousands
indicates it was something non-viral.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.509
Although I still need to rule out
anything bacterial, parasitic, prionic,

09:28.634 --> 09:30.148
virotic, and of course fungal.

09:30.569 --> 09:31.778
I was kidding.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.781
No, no, never rule out anything
until you've ruled it out.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.418
And I want you guys
to ask each of the victims

09:37.543 --> 09:39.369
my list of field recovery questions.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.664
- Artie, not the questions, please?
- God, they're embarrassing.

09:42.832 --> 09:46.084
Yeah, my only pleasure left in life.
Concocting ways to embarrass you.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.344
Here, in case you lost them.

09:48.955 --> 09:49.796
Take this.

09:51.165 --> 09:55.219
How can it matter if a person
smells fudge before an incident?

09:55.387 --> 09:58.680
Yeah, or if your gall bladder
is feeling numb?

09:58.849 --> 09:59.848
Humor me.

10:00.651 --> 10:02.100
I want you to go to Unionville.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.289
Find out if these three people
are connected. 

10:04.414 --> 10:06.662
If they are, is there an artifact
at the center of it?

10:06.787 --> 10:08.626
If there is, bring it home. Simple.

10:08.751 --> 10:10.944
Easy peasy. A transpo.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.864
My truck's still in lake Michigan.

10:12.989 --> 10:14.488
- God, that was cold.
- Word.

10:16.646 --> 10:17.449
All right.

10:18.323 --> 10:19.330
Take my car.

10:19.944 --> 10:21.495
Just no food, no drink.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.539
Don't go over 55.
Don't park near anything.

10:26.084 --> 10:26.890
What?

10:27.299 --> 10:29.406
After a certain age,
a person likes to have a nice car.

10:36.761 --> 10:40.597
Artie, one of us needs to be in charge.
Somebody has to run point.

10:42.528 --> 10:44.448
- You.
- Good, we're both on the same page.

10:44.573 --> 10:46.228
Of course.
You're the obvious choice.

10:47.450 --> 10:50.616
Just do me a favor, please.
Let Pete think that he's running things.

10:50.741 --> 10:52.721
He's very touchy.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.135
- I can make that work.
- Good.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.788
So any news on the breach
at the Warehouse?

11:04.956 --> 11:06.304
There's been no breach.

11:06.429 --> 11:09.091
Just a two-bit hacker
who's going nowhere.

11:09.216 --> 11:11.645
Well, after the dead end
at Dickinson's,

11:11.770 --> 11:13.880
it looks like you're the one
that's getting nowhere.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.349
I, my dear, am choosing
to ignore this irritating pest.

11:17.736 --> 11:19.422
I suggest you do the same.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.122
There could be
a probable explanation.

11:29.247 --> 11:32.383
High-tension power lines.
A nearby chemical spill.

11:32.508 --> 11:33.886
People just don't go crazy.

11:34.399 --> 11:35.690
Why don't you go

11:35.815 --> 11:39.884
to the local county records office,
see if you can pull the geographics...

11:40.009 --> 11:43.118
How about we just talk to folks
and get a vibe for the town first?

11:44.078 --> 11:45.253
We need a plan.

11:45.858 --> 11:48.373
Something with a little more logic
and a little less kumbaya.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.790
Or we could just,
you know, improvise.

12:01.007 --> 12:03.319
50 cents! Can you believe that?

12:07.587 --> 12:08.870
See what happens?

12:09.271 --> 12:10.882
Okay, now we have a plan.

12:11.326 --> 12:13.209
No, now we improvise.

12:13.334 --> 12:17.194
People always blaming the other guy.
This patient weighed 300 pounds.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.444
He smoked like a chimney.
All he ate was butter.

12:19.569 --> 12:22.399
He was dead before he got to us.
It's my fault he had a heart attack?

12:22.524 --> 12:26.203
- He was dead before he got to us.
- Excuse me... My husband died of...

12:26.563 --> 12:28.663
What the hell with them.
What do they know?

12:28.831 --> 12:31.367
- Would you mind, please?
- Lady, I'm on a break. Do you mind?

12:32.967 --> 12:35.462
Some old lady looking
for free medical advice probably.

12:51.879 --> 12:54.719
I don't think that it's your high blood
pressure medicine that's causing this.

12:54.844 --> 12:56.478
I'm so embarrassed.

12:57.138 --> 12:58.681
My daughter will be furious.

12:59.005 --> 13:03.323
You know, it could be a receptor
or channel blockers can cause dizziness

13:03.491 --> 13:06.910
or it could be a sugar imbalance.
I noticed your diabetic pendant.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.432
You're a doctor?

13:09.858 --> 13:11.839
No, I just know a lot.

13:14.821 --> 13:17.129
Her insulin levels are good.
It's not her meds.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.798
Besides, Meg's not the only one
to go off the deep end lately.

13:21.318 --> 13:22.121
Really?

13:23.194 --> 13:25.366
That's one crazy old lady in there?

13:26.464 --> 13:28.410
Meg's an eighth-grade
English teacher.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.069
She's as sane as I am.

13:31.848 --> 13:32.883
Wait a minute.

13:33.008 --> 13:36.815
She spends all day with 13 year olds and
one bluetool sends her over the edge?

13:37.168 --> 13:39.075
I guess everybody has their limit.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.798
Any similarities between her,
the flying nun, and that violinist kid?

13:44.035 --> 13:46.058
What did you say
you were doing in Unionville?

13:46.909 --> 13:49.870
My wife and I are just passing through.
We're on our honeymoon.

13:50.770 --> 13:53.623
Anybody mention smelling fudge or...

13:55.205 --> 13:58.302
- What do you do for a living, mister...
- Pete. I'm Pete.

13:58.711 --> 14:00.572
- And you're...
- Mac.

14:00.932 --> 14:02.746
Everybody around here
just calls me Mac.

14:02.871 --> 14:04.487
<i>We got another situation.</i>

14:05.210 --> 14:06.344
What's up, Sal?

14:06.512 --> 14:08.594
<i>Tommy was caught trying
to set the music room on fire.</i>

14:08.719 --> 14:11.349
- <i>Principal wants you to come down.</i>
- On my way, Sal.

14:11.791 --> 14:13.319
Have a nice honeymoon.

14:16.958 --> 14:19.024
Honeymoon?
Why would you say that?

14:19.493 --> 14:22.694
I wanted a cover.
I don't wanna say who we are just yet.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.932
You know, we stay on the down low,
we operate more freely.

14:26.057 --> 14:29.877
Okay, you just can't run around town
saying whatever comes into your head.

14:30.058 --> 14:32.534
We have to stay under the radar.
Remember stealth?

14:32.659 --> 14:34.879
Covers are, like,
the definition of stealth.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.699
Plus, I'm very good at them.

14:37.498 --> 14:40.121
You're ten years old.
You are ten years old.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.620
You know, I'm gonna
go interview the nun.

14:42.745 --> 14:43.496
Fine.

14:43.621 --> 14:46.635
Sounds like the violinist kid is getting
worse, so I'm gonna go check that out.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.971
- That's all right with you, Sarge?
- You're eight years old.

14:53.486 --> 14:54.884
I knew I could fly.

14:56.438 --> 14:57.619
I just knew it.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.940
Where were you before you...

15:01.567 --> 15:02.400
jumped?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.869
I had just left the center.

15:03.994 --> 15:07.239
Sister Grace works most days
at a battered women's shelter.

15:07.828 --> 15:10.886
Have you received
any jewelry of any kind recently?

15:11.011 --> 15:13.157
Any gifts?
Anything new?

15:13.282 --> 15:15.872
We are nuns.
We renounce worldly possessions.

15:16.494 --> 15:18.029
Of course.
Right.

15:19.318 --> 15:22.045
Did you know Tommy Wilson
or Meg... Riley?

15:22.608 --> 15:23.588
Not really.

15:24.021 --> 15:26.755
- Is Tommy all right?
- Yes, I just thought maybe...

15:26.880 --> 15:28.051
I can fly.

15:29.871 --> 15:30.871
I can.

15:34.328 --> 15:36.120
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

15:36.245 --> 15:37.310
Will you excuse us?

15:41.897 --> 15:44.038
Hey, Mac, sorry to bother you,

15:44.163 --> 15:46.568
but can I ask you a few
questions about the Wilson kid?

15:46.693 --> 15:49.182
Strange way to spend
your honeymoon there, Pete.

15:49.307 --> 15:50.245
Lattimer.

15:50.447 --> 15:51.870
Agent Pete Lattimer.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.691
Secret service.

15:54.228 --> 15:55.161
Secret service?

15:55.330 --> 15:58.337
Hope you're not flashing that badge
all over town and scaring folks.

15:58.462 --> 15:59.993
No one's trying to scare anybody.

16:00.118 --> 16:04.460
I've got enough problems without people
thinking this is a terrorist plot.

16:04.585 --> 16:05.714
There's no plot.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.879
Look, Mac,
you just let me do my job.

16:08.004 --> 16:09.685
- No one will be hurt.
- No, sir,

16:09.810 --> 16:12.591
not if your job
is sneaking around lying to folks.

16:12.716 --> 16:14.868
I don't trust people who lie to me.

16:14.993 --> 16:17.492
I just need to ask Tommy
a few questions.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.973
Tommy Wilson slipped
into a coma about an hour ago.

16:21.705 --> 16:24.036
Now can the secret service
explain that?

16:24.458 --> 16:26.712
Because the doctors
sure as hell can't.

16:32.545 --> 16:35.561
I noticed that Sister Grace was wearing
one of those rubber bracelets

16:35.686 --> 16:37.412
for domestic violence awareness.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.459
Yes, she came
to us about a year ago.

16:39.584 --> 16:42.646
I can't go into details,
but there was a fair amount of abuse.

16:42.771 --> 16:43.626
I'm sorry.

16:43.972 --> 16:45.658
Has she been depressed lately?

16:45.783 --> 16:48.673
I mean, I'm assuming
this incident is new behavior.

16:49.205 --> 16:52.481
She hasn't jumped off any other
buildings, if that's what you mean.

16:52.606 --> 16:54.487
Of course not.
It's just...

16:54.612 --> 16:57.223
I'd really like her to get some rest
if that's all right with you.

16:57.502 --> 16:58.763
Right. Sure.

16:58.888 --> 17:00.508
Thank you, Father.

17:01.934 --> 17:03.008
Sister Grace?

17:04.565 --> 17:05.940
My God, look!

17:23.646 --> 17:24.804
Sister Grace!

17:26.021 --> 17:26.964
The wind.

17:28.793 --> 17:30.862
Stay there, Sister.
I'm coming up.

17:32.896 --> 17:33.801
Sister!

17:34.399 --> 17:35.399
I can fly.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.288
You cannot fly!

17:39.434 --> 17:40.642
Grace Ellen!

17:51.835 --> 17:54.441
<i>So wait,
the snow bank saved her life?</i>

17:55.116 --> 17:58.159
Sister grace is alive,
but she's all busted up from the fall.

17:58.284 --> 18:00.937
Should put the snow bank in a Warehouse.
It sounds like it's intensifying.

18:01.062 --> 18:03.442
- Is Tommy still in a coma?
- <i>Yeah, yeah. I was just over there.</i>

18:03.567 --> 18:06.501
<i>The doctor said
he just kind of shutdown.</i>

18:06.866 --> 18:09.546
Okay, well that sounds like
it's causing some kind of regression.

18:09.715 --> 18:12.257
<i>You gotta find this thing fast
before it gets worse. You got that?</i>

18:17.163 --> 18:19.597
- Have you ever seen anything like this?
- Well, actually, once

18:19.765 --> 18:23.476
there was this little bell and
what it did was it made people laugh.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.984
<i>Well, that doesn't sound
very dangerous.</i>

18:26.647 --> 18:29.274
Well, the victims would ultimately
laugh themselves to death.

18:29.716 --> 18:32.777
- <i>Cardiac arrest due to asphyxiation.</i>
- Freaky.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.779
<i>You're saying there's always a link?</i>

18:34.947 --> 18:35.771
Always.

18:35.896 --> 18:39.993
And you just keep looking under rocks
and I'll do what I can from here, okay?

18:43.649 --> 18:44.739
Book on tape.

18:48.708 --> 18:50.378
It's always mind control.

19:00.647 --> 19:01.930
I have work to do.

19:36.548 --> 19:37.585
That's that.

19:51.775 --> 19:52.914
Now cut that out.

20:00.288 --> 20:02.652
- Thanks.
- You didn't get that from me.

20:03.607 --> 20:05.332
I'm running a business here.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.644
So nothing connects.
Tommy never had Meg as a teacher.

20:10.769 --> 20:12.143
Meg doesn't know Sister Grace.

20:12.268 --> 20:14.810
And Sister Grace taught Sunday school,
but Tommy never took it.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.019
So they're all doing things
completely out of character?

20:18.144 --> 20:21.553
So if someone does something totally
opposite from what they normally do...

20:22.690 --> 20:23.582
Drugs.

20:24.589 --> 20:27.307
Although the old lady and the nun
don't strike me as crackheads.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.620
Not so much.

20:29.638 --> 20:32.584
I thought the medic knew something,
so I asked him to meet me after work.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.232
Good idea.
I got a thing to do.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.693
But I want you to be careful.
I want you to use a condom.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.629
That's hilarious.

20:48.296 --> 20:50.081
- Thanks for taking the time.
- No worries.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.403
Wife's taking care of the twins, so.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.918
- Congratulations.
- Six months.

20:55.194 --> 20:56.754
They say it gets easier.

20:58.270 --> 21:00.964
- Do you wanna sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

21:02.265 --> 21:03.556
Sorry I'm late, by the way.

21:03.681 --> 21:06.306
- It's just such a weird day.
- Did something else happen?

21:06.474 --> 21:08.558
Do you remember Meg,
from the coffee shop?

21:08.726 --> 21:11.368
Let me guess.
She went a little crazier, right?

21:12.465 --> 21:16.065
Middle of a meeting for a carnival,
she threw a lamp at Father Braid.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.667
- Was he hurt?
- He's all right. I was at his office.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.778
A couple of stitches
and she broke her wrist.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.400
But the weird thing is
they're really good friends.

21:23.525 --> 21:25.783
Father Braid helped her
through the loss of her husband.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.328
Did he die at the hospital
where Meg threw the urn?

21:28.555 --> 21:30.772
In the emergency room.
He had a heart attack.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.722
I'm up here.

22:06.975 --> 22:07.975
I'm Dave.

22:08.235 --> 22:10.350
Haven't seen you around before.
You new?

22:10.885 --> 22:13.873
Eight years actually.
I'm just passing through town.

22:14.245 --> 22:15.245
I'm Pete.

22:16.265 --> 22:17.465
Welcome, Pete.

22:17.675 --> 22:20.171
- It's a great meeting.
- Good. I could use one tonight.

22:20.485 --> 22:22.882
All right, meeting time.
Take a seat if you can, please.

22:23.585 --> 22:26.485
Welcome to the Saturday night
solutions meeting.

22:27.075 --> 22:29.375
My name is Ellis.
I'm an alcoholic.

22:31.085 --> 22:33.385
And I'll be your leader for tonight.

22:37.159 --> 22:39.435
Can you think of anything
these people have in common?

22:39.560 --> 22:41.776
I can't.
Meg isn't even from Unionville.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.320
- She's from Colton.
- That could be important.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.573
- How far is...
- Can I just touch these?

22:49.285 --> 22:52.649
I'm sorry! I don't know why I'd do that!
I've never done anything like that.

22:52.774 --> 22:55.236
- I'm married. I told you. I have twins.
- Wait a second.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.584
Just wait a second.

22:58.935 --> 23:00.735
Can I just touch this one?

23:01.985 --> 23:05.174
- I think I know what's going on here.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That hurts.

23:05.823 --> 23:07.945
- I don't know why I keep doing that.
- I believe you.

23:08.070 --> 23:10.246
I just rather
you didn't do it again, okay?

23:11.395 --> 23:13.845
- Ross, you lost your balance.
- What?

23:14.445 --> 23:16.590
Right before you just...
you lost your balance.

23:16.715 --> 23:19.447
So did Meg before she threw
that guy through the glass

23:19.572 --> 23:21.092
and Tommy in the video.

23:21.217 --> 23:22.717
What are you saying?

23:23.365 --> 23:24.565
You've got it.

23:25.125 --> 23:27.739
Whatever this is,
you've been affected too.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.611
And if not for this program
taking it one day at a time,

23:32.736 --> 23:35.038
I'd have been dead 22 years ago.

23:35.206 --> 23:38.291
But I was willing to do anything
to keep from taking that next drink.

23:38.565 --> 23:39.565
Anything.

23:39.875 --> 23:40.975
So if you...

23:48.375 --> 23:49.719
Dave, you all right?

23:53.465 --> 23:54.465
Excuse me.

23:56.468 --> 23:57.998
- Thank you for this.
- No problem.

23:58.123 --> 24:00.480
Okay, so we know
that you've been in contact with Meg.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.155
What about Sister Grace
or Tommy Wilson?

24:03.375 --> 24:07.505
No, I don't even know Tommy
and I've only seen the Sister at church.

24:13.555 --> 24:15.203
Dave, what are you doing here?

24:18.365 --> 24:19.515
Hang on, Myka.

24:20.595 --> 24:22.627
- Thanks, Pete.
- Yeah, it's all right, man.

24:25.185 --> 24:26.535
Dave, cut it out!

24:28.465 --> 24:31.302
- Dave, what are you doing?
- Yeah, you got over 20 years, man.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.262
What's up?
Did something happen to you?

24:33.387 --> 24:35.687
- Why? Who are you?
- This is Pete.

24:36.361 --> 24:38.184
Pete, this is Ellis Hayes,
my therapist.

24:40.354 --> 24:41.854
For crying out loud.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.568
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.
I won't touch your breasts anymore.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.860
What are you doing?
We talked about this.

24:48.134 --> 24:49.362
Wait, you talked to Ross?

24:49.530 --> 24:53.199
Wait a minute. Do you treat an old lady
named Meg and a teenage violinist?

24:53.367 --> 24:55.767
I can't discuss my patients
with you.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.540
We got a lot of questions
for you, pal.

25:03.752 --> 25:04.752
Hurry, uncuff me.

25:09.425 --> 25:12.009
- We need to get him to a hospital.
- Call 911.

25:18.325 --> 25:21.717
- <i>Okay, so what, Dave is in a coma too?</i>
- He collapsed right in front of us.

25:21.842 --> 25:23.813
The doctors are bringing in
some specialist.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.800
<i>I doubt that specialist
is gonna be any help.</i>

25:25.925 --> 25:28.470
<i>I think this thing ultimately shuts down
the central nervous system.</i>

25:28.595 --> 25:31.237
<i>I'm worried it's gonna go further
and shutdown the body entirely.</i>

25:31.405 --> 25:33.475
- <i>What about that therapist?</i>
- I'm going to see him.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.958
I'm gonna go see Father Braid.

25:35.083 --> 25:37.778
See if I can get details about
when Sister Grace went into therapy.

25:37.903 --> 25:39.626
- Maybe it's time related.
- <i>Time?</i>

25:40.982 --> 25:42.530
<i>The pattern of behavior here</i>

25:42.655 --> 25:46.239
<i>is the result of individual contact
with the same artifact.</i>

25:46.364 --> 25:48.669
<i>It was something they found.</i>

25:48.794 --> 25:50.923
<i>They might have seen it.
Probably, they touched it.</i>

25:51.091 --> 25:52.350
What am I looking for?

25:52.475 --> 25:56.037
<i>Anything that might cause an electrical
or chemical imbalance in the brain.</i>

25:56.805 --> 25:57.972
So a brain imbalancer.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.850
<i>That's easy. It's probably
right next to his time-travel machine.</i>

26:01.865 --> 26:04.850
Trust yourselves. You'll know it when
you see it. That's why we chose you.

26:04.975 --> 26:07.523
<i>Instinct and observation.
You're a great team.</i>

26:09.304 --> 26:13.004
- <i>What is that? Where are you?</i>
- We are at an ice skating rink.

26:13.352 --> 26:15.740
- Feel better there, twinkle toes?
- I like skating,

26:16.200 --> 26:17.575
<i>and it helps me think, Artie.</i>

26:17.795 --> 26:19.545
I have nothing but faith.

26:21.682 --> 26:22.705
Nothing but faith.

26:26.765 --> 26:29.265
For crying out loud.
Who designed this?

26:29.805 --> 26:33.174
Thomas Edison, Nicola Tesla,
and MC Escher.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.572
- What are you doing here?
- Thought you might need me.

26:35.697 --> 26:36.844
- Do you?
- Please.

26:37.250 --> 26:40.514
It's no big deal. I'm just tracking down
an electrical short or an anomaly.

26:41.215 --> 26:42.475
I tracked it down.

26:52.565 --> 26:54.028
I'll take that as a yes.

26:56.285 --> 26:58.485
I don't care if you're James Bond.

26:58.825 --> 27:02.829
What a therapist discusses with
his patients is completely privileged.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.650
- Well, not under the Patriot Act.
- I have no intention of...

27:10.975 --> 27:13.339
Look, Ellis, people are being hurt.

27:14.005 --> 27:17.051
Believe me, you want to help me or
you're not gonna have any patients left.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.280
What's this?

27:23.215 --> 27:24.565
Don't touch that.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.144
Please.

27:26.585 --> 27:28.120
- I just acquired it.
- Really?

27:28.245 --> 27:30.695
No, don't pick it up.
It's an antique.

27:31.385 --> 27:34.110
Belonged to Joseph Dunninger,
the famous mentalist.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.560
Are you kidding me, man?

27:35.685 --> 27:39.012
What, you didn't think
that this was worth mentioning?

27:39.137 --> 27:40.449
I collect pocket watches.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.493
There's nothing in the Patriot Act
about that.

27:42.845 --> 27:44.766
- I have to take this with me.
- You what?

27:44.891 --> 27:47.707
Don't snap your pencil.
I'll get it back to you...

27:48.715 --> 27:49.715
Probably.

27:49.985 --> 27:53.439
Sheriff McKenna was just here
and I told him the same thing.

27:53.655 --> 27:56.555
Sister Grace has never been
to see Ellis Hayes.

27:57.509 --> 28:01.463
- Well, how can you be sure?
- Cause I suggested it and she refused.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.222
She was mortified by the idea.

28:03.390 --> 28:06.559
I happen to believe in therapy.
I suggested it to Meg as well.

28:06.896 --> 28:09.902
- Anger issues?
- When Ben died, she felt betrayed

28:10.027 --> 28:12.648
by doctors, by God.

28:12.944 --> 28:15.526
- It's quite common for...
- I know how she feels.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.479
Since I lost Sam...

28:20.140 --> 28:22.140
the men in my life drive me...

28:24.124 --> 28:26.787
even before my Dad...

28:26.955 --> 28:28.767
Yes, well, to get back to Meg,

28:28.892 --> 28:31.152
I suppose she's been
more angry with...

28:31.277 --> 28:34.795
Men. Angry at men.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.258
Agent Bering?

28:36.589 --> 28:40.772
My boss, my colleagues,
my partner, my father,

28:40.897 --> 28:43.308
they're everywhere, suffocating.

28:47.829 --> 28:49.018
Are you all right?

28:53.306 --> 28:55.566
Well...
Thank you so much.

28:56.139 --> 28:57.068
I'll...

28:57.300 --> 28:59.100
I'll just show myself out.

29:02.533 --> 29:04.168
Ellis just called me.
He's very upset.

29:04.293 --> 29:07.226
Now I wanna know just
what the hell you two are up to.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.200
I got people to protect
in this town.

29:10.338 --> 29:12.249
You think you can just
walk all over me?

29:12.762 --> 29:15.589
Dude, you're taking this
kind of personal, don't you think?

29:15.714 --> 29:16.796
Secret service?

29:17.165 --> 29:18.839
Anybody could buy a badge
on the net.

29:19.156 --> 29:21.175
I don't know
what you two got planned.

29:21.343 --> 29:25.429
But I will do whatever I have to
to protect my country.

29:27.512 --> 29:28.662
Chew on that.

29:37.327 --> 29:38.526
And where have you been?

29:38.945 --> 29:40.904
- No, I was...
- I've been here for half an hour

29:41.029 --> 29:43.494
and the sheriff is
a little spooky, FYI.

29:43.619 --> 29:45.200
But don't worry,

29:45.325 --> 29:47.636
because I found it.

29:51.376 --> 29:53.126
Joseph Dunninger's watch.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.728
He's a famous mentalist,
in case you didn't know.

29:55.853 --> 29:57.958
So score one for the Pete-dog.

30:00.220 --> 30:02.049
Don't worry.
You're still in charge.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.176
I mean, look,
We can't all be heroes all the time.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.637
- Your chance to be a hero...
- You're an ass.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.309
Geez Louise.

30:13.682 --> 30:15.438
Okay, little girl, fun's over.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.736
I think you got it.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.699
You're infected.

30:29.027 --> 30:31.092
Thanks for bailing me out,
but this is ridiculous.

30:31.217 --> 30:33.999
I've been exposed to the artifact.
I should stay locked up.

30:34.124 --> 30:37.208
What am I supposed to do, let you sit
in jail and quietly slip into a coma?

30:37.333 --> 30:40.630
I could get really dangerous to you.

30:41.398 --> 30:43.508
- I'm going back inside.
- Wait, wait, wait. Look.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.217
No, you look.
You have a job to do.

30:45.618 --> 30:48.582
How can you trust me if you know
that I could turn on you at any minute?

30:48.707 --> 30:50.191
Because I do, okay?

30:50.316 --> 30:52.688
I just do. You're gonna have to do more
than take a swing at me.

30:52.813 --> 30:56.403
Besides, how are you gonna be in charge
if you're in jail?

30:56.741 --> 30:58.618
Who's gonna tell me what to do?

31:03.657 --> 31:06.008
Artie, I've got it.
I've been exposed.

31:06.133 --> 31:08.280
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- Oh, yeah, we're sure.

31:08.659 --> 31:12.047
<i>Okay. It's just that much more important
to find this artifact fast.</i>

31:12.172 --> 31:14.775
Artie, look. So there's no way
it could be the watch, right?

31:14.900 --> 31:18.898
I mean, maybe the, you know...
the anti-magnetic bag thing didn't work.

31:19.023 --> 31:21.378
It is not the watch.
Myka didn't touch the watch.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.247
<i>And Sister Grace
wasn't even a patient.</i>

31:23.372 --> 31:26.208
<i>I told him it wasn't the watch.
I told you it wasn't the watch.</i>

31:26.333 --> 31:29.345
- <i>That's not annoying at all.</i>
- Look, guys. You're doing great.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.956
You just have to both go out there
and keep looking.

31:32.081 --> 31:34.502
<i>Artie, I've been exposed.
I have to stay locked up.</i>

31:34.627 --> 31:37.520
- <i>Yeah, I told her I can handle it.
- Please, like you handled the bar?</i>

31:38.980 --> 31:41.273
Get it together.
People are in hospitals.

31:41.607 --> 31:44.401
<i>It's only a question of time
before somebody dies</i>

31:44.569 --> 31:47.071
from this thing
that you have not found yet.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.989
- <i>All right.
- Okay.</i>

31:54.283 --> 31:56.321
You know,
he's trying to find the location

31:56.446 --> 31:58.972
of this warehouse
by probing the electrical grid.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.151
Look at that.

32:01.444 --> 32:02.794
Not a bad notion.

32:03.586 --> 32:05.136
This guy's a thinker.

32:05.261 --> 32:07.463
And what, we're just sitting ducks?

32:08.086 --> 32:11.853
Look at that. It's completely unfocused.
He's got no actual control of anything.

32:11.978 --> 32:14.723
He's just causing trouble.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.624
Well, he seems to be doing
a good job of that.

32:21.072 --> 32:21.901
Yeah.

32:25.312 --> 32:27.928
Okay, so maybe there's something
going on before it affects you.

32:28.053 --> 32:31.156
I insist that you handcuff me.
Make sure that I can't hurt you.

32:31.324 --> 32:35.215
- Look, let's find the artifact...
- I need you to disarm the danger first.

32:35.340 --> 32:38.289
- That's what you're supposed to...
- I don't understand why you can't just

32:38.457 --> 32:40.791
listen to me for once.

32:41.140 --> 32:42.340
No, you don't!

32:42.823 --> 32:44.532
Okay, all right. All right.

32:44.657 --> 32:47.089
- Sorry about that.
- No, no. No worries.

32:47.391 --> 32:50.175
It's my fault.
I kind of did that on purpose.

32:50.471 --> 32:52.610
What were you thinking just then?
What were you feeling?

32:52.735 --> 32:53.762
Nothing.

32:54.677 --> 32:57.199
Okay, I was kind of thinking
that you were an infantile chimp.

32:57.324 --> 32:58.934
- I'm sorry.
- No, okay. That's good.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.650
So obviously it affects
your subconscious.

33:01.775 --> 33:04.346
Subconscious?
Subconscious desires.

33:04.691 --> 33:07.134
That's it.
Meg wants revenge.

33:07.259 --> 33:09.488
Sister Grace wants to escape.

33:09.613 --> 33:12.531
Ross... I bet that Ross's wife
is still breast-feeding.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.875
And Tommy secretly hates the violin.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.994
And you subconsciously
wanna punch me every five minutes.

33:18.119 --> 33:19.330
Okay, sometimes.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.548
But why me and not you?
And why hasn't the whole town gone nuts?

33:22.673 --> 33:25.579
Let's just retrace our steps.
Where have you gone that I haven't?

33:25.704 --> 33:28.335
We were at the coffee shop.
And at the bar.

33:28.460 --> 33:31.967
I was at the jail, but nobody else there
was affected, so I don't...

33:34.957 --> 33:36.013
That's Ross.

33:37.432 --> 33:38.281
That's Meg.

33:38.406 --> 33:40.476
- You've been in that church.
- Twice. You?

33:40.807 --> 33:41.807
No.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.734
Father, it's in the church.

33:49.111 --> 33:52.018
- What's in the church?
- Tommy Wilson, Meg, Dave, Ross,

33:52.143 --> 33:54.232
they're all members
of your congregation, right?

33:54.357 --> 33:56.748
What do they have in common?
Are they on some committee together?

33:56.873 --> 33:58.219
No, they're not even...

33:58.344 --> 34:00.704
I've seen each of them recently.
They've each been in here.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.033
- Wait. Here? Here in this office?
- Here.

34:03.837 --> 34:04.850
It's in here.

34:04.975 --> 34:07.044
Of course it is.
I've been in here too.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.295
You should get out of here.
Get out of here now.

34:09.603 --> 34:11.101
- It can't be that simple.
- Why?

34:11.226 --> 34:13.764
Father Braid isn't affected.
Father, where do you talk to them?

34:13.889 --> 34:16.228
- Where are you sitting?
- In that chair.

34:16.757 --> 34:17.858
And I sat...

34:22.510 --> 34:23.706
It's the chair.

34:23.831 --> 34:27.310
- Father, where did you get this chair?
- I inherited it from my great-great...

34:27.435 --> 34:28.649
- Got it.
- I'm on it.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.170
- How long have you had the chair?
- About a week or so.

34:31.295 --> 34:33.911
- What is that thing?
- It's a... we...

34:34.036 --> 34:36.123
- Never mind.
- Father, what's his name,

34:36.248 --> 34:38.043
the original owner,
your great-great...

34:38.168 --> 34:40.364
- James Braid. He was a doctor.
- <i>Did he... wait.</i>

34:40.489 --> 34:42.705
- <i>Did he say "James Braid"?</i>
- Yes.

34:45.791 --> 34:48.043
- He's the father of hypnotherapy.
- <i>Artie, that's it!</i>

34:48.210 --> 34:50.295
<i>Father Braid has his chair.
That's it, right?</i>

34:50.463 --> 34:52.672
Hang on, hang on.
He's a direct descendent.

34:52.841 --> 34:55.384
If he's got the same DNA,
same vocal patterns...

34:55.553 --> 34:58.321
- it's the iron springs.
- The springs in the chair?

34:58.446 --> 35:01.306
<i>If they've become ferromagnetized,
like silverware can...</i>

35:01.474 --> 35:02.396
Screwdrivers.

35:02.521 --> 35:05.051
<i>... years of powerful hypnotherapy
and brain waves...</i>

35:05.176 --> 35:06.645
All those patients sat...

35:07.869 --> 35:08.989
in this chair.

35:09.734 --> 35:11.944
And those springs
began to work on their own.

35:12.069 --> 35:13.917
Releasing their
subconscious desires.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.676
- <i>Combined with the sound of his voice.</i>
- Like a tuning fork.

35:16.801 --> 35:18.728
Are you saying this chair
caused all this?

35:18.853 --> 35:21.199
I know. It's freaky.
This stuff is always freaky.

35:21.324 --> 35:22.983
Artie, how do we reverse this?

35:23.108 --> 35:25.502
<i>You know, you could try
dousing the chair.</i>

35:27.759 --> 35:29.015
<i>What's going on?</i>

35:38.769 --> 35:40.637
There you are.
Just who I was looking for.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.723
Sheriff, put the gun down.

35:43.009 --> 35:44.050
It's a virus!

35:44.175 --> 35:48.110
You planted a virus in my town
and I've gotta contain it!

35:55.064 --> 35:56.735
Father, are you hit anywhere else?

35:56.860 --> 35:58.906
It's my shoulder. It hurts.

35:59.210 --> 36:01.925
So I take it Sheriff MacKenna
sat in that chair recently?

36:02.050 --> 36:03.845
- Yesterday.
- Great.

36:04.087 --> 36:05.858
Here.
Father, let me see that.

36:07.002 --> 36:09.451
- Where are Susan and the twins?
- No, it's okay. They're outside.

36:09.576 --> 36:12.544
- The canister of goo is in the trunk.
- Let me see. Let me see.

36:12.797 --> 36:14.453
I'll take care of the father.

36:15.933 --> 36:18.592
I'm gonna clean up this town!
You understand me?

36:27.956 --> 36:29.340
Get him outside right now.

36:29.465 --> 36:32.291
And get everyone as far away
from here as possible.

36:33.252 --> 36:35.484
You understand me?
Clean up this town!

36:35.652 --> 36:38.936
- The Tesla would ignite that bomb?
- Let's test that theory another day.

36:39.061 --> 36:41.359
Then go douse the chair.
I'll take care of Captain America.

36:41.484 --> 36:43.799
No, no, he hates you.
You go douse the chair.

36:43.924 --> 36:46.549
For once, would you just
let me call it?

36:46.871 --> 36:48.830
It would be better
if you weren't here, Pete.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.458
Why do you always have
to be so bossy?

36:52.964 --> 36:54.107
I'm sorry.

36:54.606 --> 36:56.110
Would you stop doing that?

36:56.643 --> 36:59.299
- Just stop pissing me off then.
- You know what? Fine. Fine.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.927
Come on out
and I'll let these people go.

37:06.975 --> 37:07.942
Watch out!

37:08.741 --> 37:09.979
Sorry, sorry.

37:10.104 --> 37:12.735
You know, if you were gonna
ask me how I would die,

37:12.860 --> 37:14.859
I would say
that being beaten to death

37:14.984 --> 37:17.568
by my partner
would be really low on the list.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.437
- You just go do the chair.
- I'm gonna go do the chair.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.448
Stay down!

37:26.857 --> 37:28.579
Don't do this, Mac!

37:29.051 --> 37:31.164
Try and focus!
This isn't you!

37:31.332 --> 37:33.735
Some must die so others will live!

37:33.860 --> 37:36.044
You don't wanna hurt
these people, Mac.

37:37.671 --> 37:40.724
I know what you're feeling.
Just try and fight it.

37:55.065 --> 37:59.058
I will not let this evil spread
to the rest of the country!

37:59.522 --> 38:00.776
It ends here!

38:00.946 --> 38:02.571
There is no danger!

38:05.923 --> 38:08.368
Listen to me.
Look around you.

38:08.756 --> 38:11.208
You know these people, right?

38:12.790 --> 38:14.374
They're your friends!

38:29.596 --> 38:30.984
I doused the chair!

38:31.185 --> 38:32.142
It's over!

38:37.609 --> 38:39.225
Okay, I'll be right back.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.702
It's a trick.
You're trying to trick me.

38:42.827 --> 38:44.357
It's not a trick, Mac.

38:44.482 --> 38:45.882
I'm on your side.

38:46.308 --> 38:49.045
Listen to me, Mac, okay?
I'm trying to help you.

38:49.170 --> 38:51.912
If you want me to trust you,
then show yourself.

38:54.417 --> 38:55.545
Show yourself!

39:03.464 --> 39:04.424
Take me.

39:06.806 --> 39:08.274
I'm the one you want.

39:09.129 --> 39:10.055
Not them.

39:10.180 --> 39:12.783
There's probably
dozens of you in town by now.

39:13.787 --> 39:14.740
Hundreds.

39:15.045 --> 39:16.324
No, it's just me.

39:16.821 --> 39:18.313
I'm the bad guy, Mac.

39:18.859 --> 39:19.859
All right?

39:21.047 --> 39:22.234
Let them go.

39:22.582 --> 39:25.034
You and your friends are dead.

39:28.359 --> 39:29.574
You lose this one.

39:36.672 --> 39:39.251
- They never should have sent a woman.
- No, you did not.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.232
Anytime now.

40:16.234 --> 40:18.582
Agent Bering... What the...

40:18.829 --> 40:21.253
There's no time.
Just help me get this thing off!

40:21.853 --> 40:23.210
Can you disarm it?

40:24.505 --> 40:27.340
- Is he still?
- No, but this thing is still ticking!

40:51.982 --> 40:53.026
What? What?

40:54.671 --> 40:55.609
Oh, God.

41:02.943 --> 41:05.159
See?
It wasn't so hard, was it?

41:07.796 --> 41:09.409
No, it wasn't hard.
Not at all.

41:09.534 --> 41:11.733
No, it was almost,
I don't know, fun.

41:14.732 --> 41:15.732
But...

41:20.476 --> 41:21.311
What is it?

41:24.463 --> 41:26.945
Look, Artie, first off...

41:27.522 --> 41:30.775
we wanted to say thanks
for letting us use your car.

41:30.900 --> 41:31.850
You know?

41:32.480 --> 41:34.324
That GPS system, that's...

41:34.492 --> 41:35.982
- Just fantastic.
- Fantastic.

41:36.107 --> 41:37.483
And the seats?

41:37.608 --> 41:39.500
I think that leather
was custom made, right?

41:39.625 --> 41:41.966
Was, like, Corinthian leather.

41:42.544 --> 41:44.271
What happened to my car?

41:44.548 --> 41:46.461
Did you...
did you ding it?

41:48.217 --> 41:50.132
- Absolutely not.
- Ding? No.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.800
- We didn't.
- Then what?

41:52.465 --> 41:55.145
Okay, look.
I needed somewhere to throw the...

41:55.871 --> 41:56.930
bomb.

41:57.099 --> 41:58.357
Someplace enclosed.

41:58.482 --> 41:59.482
Oh, God.

42:01.404 --> 42:04.945
We did manage to save your cassette.

42:08.715 --> 42:10.031
I loved that car.

42:10.496 --> 42:11.319
Loved.

42:11.909 --> 42:12.855
Loved.

42:17.238 --> 42:20.412
- Psych!
- That's what you get for lying to us.

42:20.623 --> 42:22.421
"Let Myka think
that she's in charge."

42:22.546 --> 42:25.479
Yeah, "Pete's touchy.
Make him think that he's in charge."

42:25.604 --> 42:27.829
- You know what I'm saying?
- What a burn.

42:29.201 --> 42:30.925
