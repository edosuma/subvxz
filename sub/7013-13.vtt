00:05.372 --> 00:08.705
Okay, Fez, now remember.
The bra wants to come off.

00:08.775 --> 00:11.437
It can't be forced.
It has to be coaxed.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.570
And... go.

00:17.817 --> 00:21.275
And they are out!

00:21.354 --> 00:24.619
Eight seconds! That's a new
foreign exchange student record!

00:24.691 --> 00:27.182
- And I think she liked it.
- Okay.

00:27.260 --> 00:31.822
That was good, but remember, the real girl
will have a head and, hopefully, arms.

00:33.299 --> 00:36.632
Hey, guys! Have I got
a surprise for me.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.470
Annette!
( Chuckles )

00:41.541 --> 00:44.840
Yeah. Annette came all the way
from California to visit me...

00:44.911 --> 00:46.845
because we're in love.

00:46.913 --> 00:51.111
Yeah, since Hyde stole my old
girlfriend-That's him.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.584
Then I remembered Annette,
and, well, I gave her a call.

00:55.655 --> 00:58.283
One thing led to anoth-
Well, hello there.

01:01.561 --> 01:05.519
So, Annette, when you get
bored with this one...

01:05.598 --> 01:07.930
I can take off a bra
in eight seconds.

01:10.603 --> 01:13.663
Well, maybe more
if you fight me.

01:13.740 --> 01:17.005
All right. Back off, Fez.
What me and Annette have is real.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.170
Which is amazing because
I even told him...

01:19.245 --> 01:21.839
that I used to be flat-chested
and have a different nose.

01:21.915 --> 01:26.511
Yeah, and I figured she looks
okay now, so what the hell?

01:26.586 --> 01:28.986
So, anyway. Annette,
you'll be staying with Donna.

01:29.055 --> 01:32.855
Um, what?

01:32.926 --> 01:37.693
No, no. It'll be fun. It'll be like having
a giant Barbie to play with.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.531
Yeah. I mean, come on, Donna.
You guys were great friends in California.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.969
Friends? The most I ever
said to her was...

01:46.039 --> 01:49.008
''Yeah, those probably do hurt
when they're sunburned.''

01:49.075 --> 01:51.339
Well, I need someplace
to stash her.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.107
Yeah, I got a footlocker
in my room.

01:54.180 --> 01:58.241
Please, Donna. I already had to take
a shower at Michael's house...

01:58.318 --> 02:00.411
and one of his brothers
took a picture of me.

02:03.890 --> 02:07.553
Kelso, I thought all your brothers
were out of the house.

02:11.664 --> 02:14.098
Uh...

02:14.167 --> 02:16.965
must've been a burglar.

02:54.774 --> 02:59.643
So, that's the tramp Michael fooled
around with in California.

02:59.712 --> 03:02.112
The nerve of him
bringing her into The Hub.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.844
I mean, people eat here.

03:04.918 --> 03:08.854
Hey, will you stop talking about how jealous
you are of Kelso's new chick?

03:08.922 --> 03:11.652
Oh, I am not jealous...

03:11.724 --> 03:16.252
but I would like to point out that the sign
on the door says, ''No dogs allowed.''

03:18.898 --> 03:23.028
Donna, can we go to your house?
I have to change into my afternoon outfit-

03:23.102 --> 03:26.037
gauchos and clogs.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.666
Bravo.

03:29.742 --> 03:32.905
Um, you have
an afternoon outfit?

03:32.979 --> 03:35.038
Of course she does.

03:35.114 --> 03:37.674
You can maybe use a little
freshening up too, Big D.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.910
- Eric, do you mind?
- I'm on it.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.115
Ow!

03:44.190 --> 03:48.490
- Donna!
- Why don't I meet you guys by the car?

03:48.561 --> 03:52.429
Come on, Michael. While we're waiting,
I'll let you smell my hair.

03:54.934 --> 03:58.597
Yeah, well,
I just got these fries.

03:58.671 --> 04:02.402
Fine. Then I'll go flirt
with the gas-station guy.

04:02.475 --> 04:05.444
Fine! God.
How hot was that?

04:08.881 --> 04:10.815
Wow.

04:10.883 --> 04:12.908
You know when you have
a dirty dream?

04:12.986 --> 04:15.955
Well, Annette is the girl
who's always in it.

04:17.322 --> 04:20.656
Oh, she should be ashamed
of what she has done to me.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.520
I don't know. I didn't
mind her in California...

04:25.598 --> 04:29.295
but now that she's got her hooks in Kelso,
something's different.

04:29.369 --> 04:32.497
Yeah. Something...
evil.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.563
I just can't put
my finger on it.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.132
Michael, I'm waiting!

04:37.210 --> 04:40.577
I was getting you
a SuperBall. Damn!

04:40.647 --> 04:43.775
I told you, I don't like
presents that bounce.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.380
Did you hear that?
The shrill voice. The bossy tone.

04:49.455 --> 04:53.289
The random hatred
of all things that bounce.

04:53.359 --> 04:56.726
Oh, my God. She's Jackie.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.062
- A new Jackie.
- A blondeJackie.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.125
( Together)
''Blackie.''

05:05.138 --> 05:07.698
We are doomed.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.867
Well, I can't spend
the night alone with that.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.967
Jackie, you have
to sleep in my house.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.309
Ooh! Good idea. Put both Jackies
in the same room.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.473
Toss some lipstick
in the middle...

05:16.549 --> 05:18.642
watch 'em tear each other
to shreds.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.846
No. No, no.
I don't wanna sleep over.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.185
- Well, I don't like her.
- Come on.

05:24.257 --> 05:28.159
We'll do, like, girlie things. It'll be like
a pajama party with makeovers.

05:28.227 --> 05:30.889
Donna, I'm not interested
in stupid girlie things.

05:30.963 --> 05:34.831
- Look, I'm not shallow anymore.
- ( Coughing )

05:37.437 --> 05:40.065
Don't do that
when I'm eating.

05:40.139 --> 05:43.040
Jackie, come on. You'll have all night
to chip away at her self-esteem.

05:43.109 --> 05:46.135
We can whisper about her and when
she asks us what we were talking about...

05:46.212 --> 05:48.840
we can giggle and say,
''Nothing.''

05:48.915 --> 05:52.146
Oh, wait.
I've done that to you.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.345
That's where I got it.

05:55.421 --> 05:58.515
Okay. Okay. Here's what I think
would teach her a good lesson.

05:58.591 --> 06:01.719
Dress her up like a Swiss mountain girl,
us fellas will come over...

06:01.794 --> 06:06.288
make a couple of daiquiris,
get a little tipsy, see what happens.

06:08.434 --> 06:13.303
What? Okay. That's not
a very good punishment.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.364
We should spank her too.

06:18.978 --> 06:21.378
- I don't hear any kids.
- They're at The Hub.

06:21.447 --> 06:25.975
So, we have the house
to ourselves.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.049
Interesting.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.718
<i>( Doorbell Rings )</i>

06:36.796 --> 06:39.321
Don't open it.
I'll throw in a foot massage.

06:39.399 --> 06:44.837
It could be The Franklin Mint. I ordered those
<i>Gone With the Wind</i> plates.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.634
Mom, Daddy.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.974
I told you not to open it.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.072
- What are you doing here?
- We just thought we'd drop by.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.245
You came all the way
from Phoenix just to drop by.

07:02.688 --> 07:07.250
Oh! So you're lost and you
need directions back home.

07:07.326 --> 07:11.353
That's no problem. Go south
until you see cactus.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.798
If you hit a guy with a sombrero,
you've gone too far.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.836
Okay. Okay.

07:21.908 --> 07:26.402
- Why are you really here?
- Well, we had a reversal of fortune.

07:26.479 --> 07:31.542
- Tell them what happened.
- I bought an ostrich farm.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.608
Tell them
what else happened.

07:33.686 --> 07:37.053
It was next
to a coyote farm.

07:39.358 --> 07:42.725
Great story. See you
at Christmas.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.855
He lost all our money.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.799
We had to sell the house in Phoenix,
which is why we're here.

07:50.670 --> 07:54.037
An ostrich farm, Burt?

07:54.106 --> 07:58.304
Who the hell wants
to eat an ostrich?

07:58.377 --> 08:01.278
Coyotes, apparently.

08:04.116 --> 08:06.641
You see what I live with?

08:06.719 --> 08:12.487
Well, I'm sure Daddy was just doing
what he thought was best.

08:12.558 --> 08:16.153
- You could show him some sympathy.
- Him?

08:16.229 --> 08:18.220
What about me?

08:18.297 --> 08:22.393
( Sighs ) It's always difficult
for the beautiful women.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.595
You never understood that,
Kitty.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.645
Jackie's acting
really strange, man.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.703
I think she doesn't like
Kelso having a new chick.

08:35.780 --> 08:39.511
No.Jackie's acting strange,
becauseJackie hates Annette...

08:39.585 --> 08:42.611
becauseJackie and Annette
are the same person.

08:42.688 --> 08:47.648
And that's scary, 'cause there can only
be one devil, one Hitler, one...

08:51.397 --> 08:53.957
Darth Vader.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.196
That's not it. Something's going on,
and I don't like it.

08:57.270 --> 09:01.502
Like, you think, maybe she still
has feelings for Kelso?

09:01.574 --> 09:03.804
I don't know,
but it's bad, man.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.368
I got the same feeling
I get right before I shoplift something.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.906
Oh, it's an old story.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.508
Orphan boy falls
for rich girl.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.578
Doofus shows up with whore.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.954
Rich girl goes back
to doofus.

09:19.025 --> 09:23.052
Fez consoles whore,
sexually.

09:23.129 --> 09:27.964
And orphan boy ends up alone,
slowly going blind from self-abuse.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.303
Too far?

09:32.371 --> 09:35.340
I had a feeling it was too far.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.208
What are you guys doin' sitting here
when the girls are having a pajama party...

09:39.278 --> 09:41.610
right next door?

09:41.681 --> 09:45.082
Oh, I can just imagine
what's going on over there.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.881
No, no, Fez.
I got this one.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.421
I know. Let's have
a pillow fight-

09:55.494 --> 09:59.897
Even though it's hard to do when I'm
encumbered by all these clothes.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.161
Jackie! Take off my nightie.

10:03.736 --> 10:06.671
Not yet.
I wanna practice kissing.

10:06.739 --> 10:11.506
Just kissing? Or can we
rub up against each other too?

10:11.577 --> 10:15.274
Well, Annette, you can't
have one without the other.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.578
( All ) Yea!

10:22.154 --> 10:24.145
Yea.

10:26.659 --> 10:31.790
You know, it occurs to me that you can see
right into Donna's house from my driveway.

10:31.864 --> 10:34.230
You don't say?

10:51.183 --> 10:53.743
I'm gonna go get
some CrackerJacks.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.523
( Scoffs ) She's so cheap, she could be
the prize in the CrackerJacks.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.490
Wow. You're jealous.

11:04.563 --> 11:07.828
I am not jealous.

11:07.900 --> 11:11.996
I just wanna pop that inflatable bitch
and watch her fly around the room.

11:16.775 --> 11:19.335
Look, here's
the thing,Jackie.

11:19.411 --> 11:23.074
Kelso likes bossy, vain,
shallow princess types...

11:23.148 --> 11:26.379
and since you're no longer available,
he shipped one in from out West.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.950
He's not supposed
to replace me.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.252
He's supposed to sit around
and pine for me.

11:32.324 --> 11:35.589
You can't have your cake
and eat it too.

11:35.661 --> 11:39.290
Oh, my God! It is always about food with you.
It's like you're not even listening.

11:43.635 --> 11:46.627
Okay. New rule
for slumber parties:

11:46.705 --> 11:49.697
Annette wears a robe.

11:54.613 --> 11:57.741
No, Annette, not the robe.

11:57.816 --> 12:00.910
Quick. Somebody yell, ''Pillow fight,''
in a girl voice.

12:00.986 --> 12:04.012
- Forman, that's your cue.
- What are you boys lookin' at?

12:06.191 --> 12:10.150
- We're just testin' out the crates.
- For charity.

12:10.229 --> 12:14.325
Right. But now that we're done,
let's head inside, gang.

12:14.399 --> 12:17.425
- You coming?
- No, I told your grandmother...

12:17.503 --> 12:19.494
I was comin' outside
for a cigarette.

12:19.571 --> 12:22.472
- Grandpa, you smoke?
- Nope.

12:27.479 --> 12:29.640
So, um-

12:30.883 --> 12:33.818
So- So did you guys
hear about that woman...

12:33.886 --> 12:36.480
who might be the first female
member of the Supreme Court?

12:36.555 --> 12:38.750
No.

12:38.824 --> 12:44.091
I did hear the Dallas Cowboys might hire
their first redheaded cheerleader.

12:44.163 --> 12:46.688
Ew!

12:47.866 --> 12:49.993
That's exactly what I said.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.304
( Gasps )
Uh-oh.

12:53.372 --> 12:55.840
Redhead in the room.

12:57.242 --> 12:59.233
- ( Whispering )
- ( Giggling )

12:59.311 --> 13:03.475
- What are you guys talking about?
- ( Together) Nothing.

13:08.053 --> 13:11.545
- Burt! Burtikins!
- <i>( TV:Sports Crowd Cheering )</i>

13:11.623 --> 13:14.091
( Shouts )
Burt!

13:14.159 --> 13:16.627
Eric, would you please
go find your grandfather...

13:16.695 --> 13:18.925
before my head explodes.

13:18.997 --> 13:21.727
You are all such nice boys.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.030
I have a quarter
for each one of you.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.870
( All )
Thanks, Grandma B.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.101
- Someone call an ambulance.
- What's wrong?

13:30.175 --> 13:32.166
Grandpa's on the ground.
He's not moving.

13:41.119 --> 13:44.885
They got ice cream
in the cafeteria!

13:44.957 --> 13:48.324
Ice cream? Kelso, my grandpa's
in intensive care.

13:48.393 --> 13:50.725
Yeah, but I told 'em it was
my grandfather...

13:50.796 --> 13:53.264
so I got the ice cream
for free.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.761
- Put it down.
- Fine...

14:00.839 --> 14:03.637
but when my burrito's ready,
I'm eatin' it.

14:05.944 --> 14:09.243
Why does everybody
go everywhere with us?

14:09.314 --> 14:12.750
Look at all these damn kids.

14:12.818 --> 14:15.286
I feel like a Mormon.

14:20.826 --> 14:24.091
Man. I feel like we should
know something by now.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.455
That is the third coffee break
that doctor's had.

14:27.532 --> 14:30.990
Hey, buddy! Quit the coffee,
fix the sickies, all right?

14:33.438 --> 14:35.599
Hey, who took my ice cream?

14:38.944 --> 14:42.004
Oh, sure. It's always
the foreign guy.

14:43.081 --> 14:45.515
Fez, you're holding
the spoon.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.985
Oh, sure. It's always
the foreign guy with the spoon.

14:50.789 --> 14:53.758
Kitty, how's Burt?

14:55.193 --> 14:57.661
Well...

14:57.729 --> 15:00.596
I don't know
how to say this.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.861
Daddy's gone to
a better place.

15:04.736 --> 15:07.603
Good. 'Cause this
hospital sucks.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.373
What?

15:12.444 --> 15:14.435
Oh.

15:15.814 --> 15:17.941
( Whispers )
This hospital sucks.

15:25.290 --> 15:28.589
Mrs. Forman, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.026
The service was lovely.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.462
Aw, geez.

15:34.666 --> 15:37.157
Aw, geez.

15:37.235 --> 15:40.136
- Aw-
- We got it, Bob.

15:44.142 --> 15:47.270
Mom, how you doin'?

15:47.346 --> 15:50.873
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Mom.

15:50.949 --> 15:54.510
Your husband, my father, is gone.
You're not fine.

15:54.586 --> 15:59.523
You're right. I think I chipped
a tooth on your manicotti.

15:59.591 --> 16:02.754
When I die, get a caterer.

16:06.965 --> 16:10.366
Hey, man. Sorry
about your grandpa.

16:10.435 --> 16:14.371
I didn't know him, but there's a Carly Simon
song that always cheers me up.

16:14.439 --> 16:17.340
- ( Clears Throat )
- No, you don't-

16:17.409 --> 16:19.900
( Singing Ballad )

16:27.219 --> 16:31.315
- Oh, that's great.
-  ( Ends )

16:33.258 --> 16:35.488
What do I do? Do I clap?

16:42.200 --> 16:44.191
I'm just gonna walk away.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.136
That was awesome.

16:49.207 --> 16:51.266
Do you know ''Devil Went
Down To Georgia''?

16:53.278 --> 16:55.974
No, Michael.
She's got better things to do.

16:56.047 --> 16:58.777
Hey, come on!
Let's go try on people's coats.

17:00.619 --> 17:05.318
So, the rich girl
goes off with the whore.

17:05.390 --> 17:07.915
That's a happy ending.

17:07.992 --> 17:10.859
Put it on ice
and you got yourself a show.

17:10.929 --> 17:14.092
Yeah, soJackie and Annette
are friends now?

17:14.165 --> 17:16.099
I guess I don't have
anything to worry about.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.467
Never count Kelso out.
He's got a way about him.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.872
You know, when he talks to you,
it's like you're the only one in the room.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.308
You're, like, half in love
with him, aren't you?

17:29.648 --> 17:31.741
Hey, Eric.
I brought you half a beer.

17:34.586 --> 17:38.647
Well, it's mixed with half a Coke,
'cause Red caught me.

17:38.723 --> 17:41.658
- So, are you okay?
- Yeah. I guess.

17:41.726 --> 17:45.685
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- I'm really sorry about your grandfather.

17:45.764 --> 17:48.699
I mean, right in your own driveway.
What was he doing out there anyway?

17:48.767 --> 17:51.759
He caught us spying
on your slumber party.

17:57.108 --> 18:00.600
You were spying on us?
Eric!

18:00.679 --> 18:03.409
We- Okay. If anyone should be mad,
it should be us...

18:03.482 --> 18:06.451
because, lady, you do not know
how to throw a slumber party.

18:08.954 --> 18:12.754
Flannel pajamas?
What are you, a hundred?

18:13.959 --> 18:16.223
You need a nightie?
I'll buy you a nightie.

18:22.567 --> 18:25.832
So, am I allowed to drink
around you guys yet?

18:25.904 --> 18:30.637
Eric, put that back.
That's your mother's emergency wine.

18:35.714 --> 18:39.115
So, um,
Mom, you haven't said much.

18:39.184 --> 18:42.642
Are you holding it in?
'Cause it's okay to let it out. We're family.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.815
If anybody needs to let anything out,
I'd be happy to leave.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.058
It's just so
typical of Burt...

18:50.128 --> 18:52.892
to make everyone come up
from Phoenix in the middle of winter.

18:52.964 --> 18:57.401
He never thought about anybody
but himself and those damned ostriches.

19:00.605 --> 19:04.905
Did you hear that?
That is not grieving.

19:04.976 --> 19:07.467
Okay, Kitty. Calm down.

19:07.546 --> 19:11.676
It's not as bad as you think.
Maybe you're just having a hot flash.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.476
Oh!

19:16.488 --> 19:20.117
Dad, no.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.387
Eric...

19:26.464 --> 19:31.094
I need you
to get to the wine.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.570
Father's thoughtless.
I'll tell her who's thoughtless.

19:43.982 --> 19:46.075
What is it?

19:48.820 --> 19:51.482
I, um,just
wanted to see...

19:51.556 --> 19:54.491
if you wanted
another blanket.

19:54.559 --> 19:57.722
Yes. That would be very nice.
Thank you.

20:11.409 --> 20:14.606
Hey, Mom. Dad wanted me
to give you this.

20:26.057 --> 20:29.515
Donna, great news.
I'm not jealous of Annette.

20:29.594 --> 20:33.860
I thought I was, and I was afraid that
I might still have feelings for Michael.

20:33.932 --> 20:36.765
But I got to know her
and now I really like her.

20:38.103 --> 20:41.334
( Sighs ) That is such a relief
because, you know...

20:41.406 --> 20:45.137
what with Burt dying,
I was worried about you.

20:45.210 --> 20:49.442
- Yeah, me too.
- That was sarcasm.

20:49.514 --> 20:52.176
Well, whatever it was,
it was very thoughtful.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.879
It is such a relief knowing
I don't have feelings for Michael.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.622
Get off my boyfriend!

21:02.627 --> 21:04.618
Oh, yeah!

21:12.771 --> 21:16.502
I don't know why she's so upset.
I was barely touching you.

21:25.150 --> 21:27.880
Okay. This one's for Burt.

21:27.952 --> 21:29.943
And a-one and a-two and a-

21:30.021 --> 21:33.513
-  ( Organ )
-  ( Singing Spiritual )

21:40.665 --> 21:43.031
Bring it home, brother!

21:49.174 --> 21:52.974
- <i>( Ends )</i>
-  ( Organ Clicks Off)

21:53.044 --> 21:55.035
Night-night.
