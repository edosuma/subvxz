♪♪

01:46.467 --> 01:48.500
"Fuck..."

01:48.500 --> 01:49.667
is a four-letter word.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.667
"Rape"...

01:50.667 --> 01:52.667
is a four-letter word.

01:52.667 --> 01:53.667
"Wife"...

01:53.667 --> 01:55.667
is a four-letter word.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.200
So is "love.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.433
"Fuck" is a curse.

01:59.433 --> 02:01.467
So is "love".

02:01.467 --> 02:04.233
And I don't just mean
boys and girls.

02:04.233 --> 02:06.367
I'm talking friends,

02:06.367 --> 02:08.600
I'm talking family.

02:34.967 --> 02:36.734
Somebody wanna
tell me

02:36.734 --> 02:39.200
what the fuck happened
to Dino Ortolani?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.967
He suffocated an AIDS patient,
Emilio Sanchez,

02:41.967 --> 02:43.200
and I put him
in the hole.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.867
I heard you had him sedated.
You what?

02:45.867 --> 02:48.300
Dr. Nathan put him on
four milligrams of lorazepam.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.533
He was violent.

02:49.533 --> 02:52.133
Since when is it prison policy
to drug inmates?

02:52.133 --> 02:53.967
What the fuck difference
does it make?

02:53.967 --> 02:55.834
Your boys had already
beat him senseless.

02:55.834 --> 02:58.967
The question is
who set him on fire?

02:58.967 --> 03:00.500
Maybe the
Latinos did it.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.533
To get Dino
for killing Sanchez.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.700
Everybody had a reason
to hate Ortolani.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.700
The homies, the Muslims,
the Aryans.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.300
Everybody wanted
to smoke him.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.600
Including you.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.600
Me?

03:10.600 --> 03:11.900
Me personally?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.300
You or some
other officer.

03:13.300 --> 03:16.166
Somebody let whoever
lit the match into the hole.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.667
Fuck you,
McManus.

03:17.667 --> 03:18.734
Yeah, fuck me.

03:18.734 --> 03:20.867
Hey, guys,
the ememy's out there.

03:22.533 --> 03:25.633
Lenny, I want you to head up
the investigation.

03:25.633 --> 03:27.367
Question everyone.

03:27.367 --> 03:29.500
Find out who
killed Ortolani

03:29.500 --> 03:31.433
before
Nino Schibetta does.

03:31.433 --> 03:33.567
Before the governor
sends in the feds.

03:33.567 --> 03:36.800
Before we have a full-scale
riot on our hands.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.767
The niggers
did Ortolani.

03:39.767 --> 03:41.266
You got any evidence
to prove that?

03:41.266 --> 03:43.333
Like you guys
ever need evidence.

03:43.333 --> 03:46.200
You hear one of them
admit to killing him?

03:47.633 --> 03:49.700
No, but
think about it.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.567
Who else is there?

03:51.567 --> 03:52.934
Latinos?

03:52.934 --> 03:57.300
No, burning isn't
the spics' style.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.834
Niggers burn things.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.967
You could've
done Ortolani.

04:00.967 --> 04:02.567
Yeah, sure.

04:02.567 --> 04:05.166
There's no valentines
between me and Dino.

04:05.166 --> 04:08.800
But when
I kill a man,

04:08.800 --> 04:09.934
it's because he's standing
in the way

04:09.934 --> 04:12.567
of my constitutional rights.

04:12.567 --> 04:16.300
I kill to protect
what's mine,

04:16.300 --> 04:19.967
what God has given me.

04:19.967 --> 04:22.500
The Sicilians
understand that.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.367
The rest of these fucks
will cut a man

04:24.367 --> 04:26.300
for a pair of sneakers,

04:26.300 --> 04:28.266
for a fucking
cigarette.

04:28.266 --> 04:30.100
They are animals.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.367
I said
break it up!

04:32.367 --> 04:34.200
Break it up!

04:34.200 --> 04:36.567
Break it up!

04:37.700 --> 04:39.333
You stupid
or what?!

04:39.333 --> 04:41.700
You want
some of this?

04:47.867 --> 04:50.867
He hasn't
come out in days?

04:50.867 --> 04:52.934
Not for dinner,
not for lunch,

04:52.934 --> 04:54.166
not for a shower.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.900
Beecher.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.934
Hey, what's up?

05:03.934 --> 05:05.800
Is he sick?

05:05.800 --> 05:08.367
Get lost
for a minute, okay?

05:08.367 --> 05:09.834
Sure.

05:09.834 --> 05:12.066
Hope you
feel better, buddy.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.433
Your ass
belongs to me.

05:17.900 --> 05:21.633
So you've been keeping pretty
much to yourself lately.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.367
Prison is a rough adjustment
for anyone,

05:26.367 --> 05:28.900
but a man
like you--

05:28.900 --> 05:30.667
They burned Ortolani.

05:30.667 --> 05:31.767
Yeah.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.667
He was tough, strong.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.500
If a guy like that
isn't safe--

05:36.500 --> 05:38.467
I could tell you
you're safe,

05:38.467 --> 05:42.433
but that would
be a lie.

05:42.433 --> 05:44.367
You gotta be careful,

05:44.367 --> 05:46.066
respectful.

05:46.066 --> 05:48.033
You gotta
try to focus

05:48.033 --> 05:50.266
on the day
you're getting released.

05:50.266 --> 05:53.333
You're married, right?
You got kids?

05:55.100 --> 05:57.133
Your family been
to visit you lately?

05:57.133 --> 05:59.567
I haven't seen Genevieve
since sentencing.

05:59.567 --> 06:03.166
That was about a month ago,
the kids since...

06:03.166 --> 06:04.667
even longer.

06:04.667 --> 06:07.233
Call your wife,
ask her to come.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.934
The first time alone.

06:08.934 --> 06:10.233
Let her get
a sense of the place.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.667
Make a romantic evening of it,
just the two of you.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.633
"Romantic"?
Here?

06:15.633 --> 06:16.633
How?

06:16.633 --> 06:18.600
Go to see
Sister Pete.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.600
Ah, here we are.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.667
Tobias Beecher.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.834
Oh, good,
you're married.

06:24.834 --> 06:26.967
A lot of fellows
in here

06:26.967 --> 06:29.100
try to bring their
girlfriends in as wives.

06:29.100 --> 06:30.767
It's no dice.

06:30.767 --> 06:32.500
Once in a while,

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
one of these guys
who is married

06:34.500 --> 06:36.500
tries to pull off
a fast one on me

06:36.500 --> 06:38.867
and pass off a hooker
as his mate.

06:38.867 --> 06:40.500
They do that once,

06:40.500 --> 06:41.900
they don't
do it again.

06:41.900 --> 06:45.734
Now the whole point of
a conjugal is not just sex,

06:45.734 --> 06:48.533
but it's your wife comes in,
she brings food,

06:48.533 --> 06:50.700
she can cook for you,
you talk to each other.

06:50.700 --> 06:56.066
You're together again,
you know?

06:58.066 --> 06:59.934
Okay.

06:59.934 --> 07:04.100
Fill in this form
and I'll handle the rest.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.600
Where you been,
sweet pea?

07:11.500 --> 07:13.600
To see
Sister Peter Marie.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.667
Went to a shrink?

07:15.667 --> 07:18.900
About those nightmares
you've been having?

07:18.900 --> 07:21.066
To arrange
a visit with my wife.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.600
Oh, a "cunt-jugal".

07:24.667 --> 07:27.367
Well, you didn't
ask my permission.

07:28.734 --> 07:31.734
When are you
gonna learn, prag?

07:31.734 --> 07:34.200
You belong to me.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.000
I make all
your decisions, right?

07:40.333 --> 07:41.667
So ask me.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.800
Come over here and ask me

07:45.800 --> 07:47.834
if you can fuck your wife.

07:49.066 --> 07:50.100
I--

07:50.100 --> 07:52.867
C'mon, ask me, now.

07:52.867 --> 07:54.467
Can I be
with my wife?

07:56.333 --> 07:57.834
"Fuck my wife".

07:57.834 --> 08:00.734
Fuck my wife.

08:00.734 --> 08:04.033
Louder, and say
"please" and "sir".

08:05.500 --> 08:08.700
Please, sir...

08:08.700 --> 08:10.767
may I fuck
my wife?

08:10.767 --> 08:12.800
Louder.

08:15.967 --> 08:17.867
Please, sir,

08:17.867 --> 08:20.734
may I fuck
my wife?!

08:20.734 --> 08:23.266
When you ask me like that,

08:23.266 --> 08:26.700
I can't deny you anything.

08:37.133 --> 08:39.533
I am here
to see my--

08:39.533 --> 08:41.200
Tobias Beecher.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.900
B-e-a--

08:42.900 --> 08:46.100
B-e-e-c-h-e-r.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.867
Okay.

08:47.867 --> 08:49.900
Let me see the basket
and your purse.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.467
They said that
I could bring food.

08:51.467 --> 08:54.834
Yeah. Step right
through here, please.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.734
Are you transporting

08:56.734 --> 08:59.667
any drugs,

08:59.667 --> 09:01.367
weapons, explosives, alcohol?

09:01.367 --> 09:03.000
No.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.467
Sign this...

09:08.467 --> 09:10.467
right here.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.033
If I was carrying
explosives,

09:13.033 --> 09:15.233
why would
I say "yes"?

09:15.233 --> 09:17.066
Lady, I don't know.

09:17.066 --> 09:20.033
The state says
I have to ask, I ask.

09:21.233 --> 09:23.867
Purse goes
in the locker.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.533
When you're
finished there,

09:31.533 --> 09:33.700
you go to room one
right here.

09:43.533 --> 09:45.133
Hi.

09:48.934 --> 09:50.000
Hi.

10:04.867 --> 10:06.967
I missed you
so much.

10:11.367 --> 10:13.567
Holly made
a painting for you,

10:13.567 --> 10:15.500
but I left it
in my purse.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.367
The guard asked me
about explosives

10:17.367 --> 10:19.467
and I completely forgot
about the painting.

10:19.467 --> 10:21.166
It's of our house.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.200
Holly and Gary
are standing out front

10:23.200 --> 10:24.700
and I'm holding
the baby.

10:24.700 --> 10:28.834
She drew the dog about
twice as big as anybody else.

10:30.633 --> 10:32.667
You're not in it.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.200
You're not in the painting.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.500
I thought I'd...

10:50.500 --> 10:52.166
make spaghetti.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.200
Please...

10:56.200 --> 10:59.400
Honey, just hold me...

10:59.400 --> 11:01.433
please.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.033
Guard:
Let's go, move it, Beecher!

11:09.033 --> 11:12.000
Lorenzo, move it!

11:12.000 --> 11:14.166
Stay right there.

11:14.166 --> 11:17.300
Let's go, Beecher,
c'mon, double time.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.467
What the fuck
is this shit?

11:51.467 --> 11:53.333
(phone ringing)

11:53.333 --> 11:57.033
Yeah.

11:57.033 --> 11:58.500
Got it.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.100
Hey, young lady.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.200
Me?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.967
No, you.

12:04.967 --> 12:06.567
We're gonna detain you
for a couple of minutes.

12:06.567 --> 12:10.500
Put your hands,
palms down, on the counter.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.834
You got some
goddamn nerve.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.867
You're in
deep shit.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.967
Who the hell do you
think you are, huh?

12:16.967 --> 12:19.800
Wipe that goddamn
smile off your face.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.900
How was it?

12:26.033 --> 12:27.266
Good.

12:29.867 --> 12:30.900
"Good"?

12:30.900 --> 12:33.400
You come from
a night of wild sex

12:33.400 --> 12:35.567
with the only
woman you love

12:35.567 --> 12:38.233
and you tell me
it was good?

12:42.033 --> 12:45.033
You've got
a lovely family.

12:45.033 --> 12:48.967
I'm amazed you haven't showed me
these pictures before.

12:50.533 --> 12:53.133
Amazed and...

12:53.133 --> 12:56.100
a little hurt.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.500
I hope you
don't mind me

12:57.500 --> 13:00.233
finding these hidden
underneath your mattress.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.600
Beautiful.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.433
My wife is dead.

13:09.333 --> 13:14.433
But I got two sons,
17 and 16.

13:14.433 --> 13:16.433
Handsome fucking
kids, too.

13:16.433 --> 13:19.100
Good Aryan stock,
you know?

13:19.100 --> 13:23.100
My sons are
devoted to me.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.066
I am an icon to them

13:25.066 --> 13:28.633
because I went to prison
for my beliefs.

13:28.633 --> 13:33.233
They would do anything
I asked them to...

13:33.233 --> 13:35.567
steal, maim...

13:35.567 --> 13:37.800
kill.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.767
Maybe I should have them
go visit your family.

13:43.767 --> 13:46.133
Huh?

13:46.133 --> 13:49.166
Just a little friendly call.
What do you think?

13:49.166 --> 13:51.700
My sons and your wife?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.367
My sons and your daughter?

14:24.166 --> 14:27.600
Man:
Bitch, herm, maytag, shim...

14:27.600 --> 14:30.967
here in Oz,
we call 'em prags.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.734
I don't know
where it comes from

14:32.734 --> 14:34.700
but you make
a man your prag,

14:34.700 --> 14:36.467
he's your prag for life.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.333
It's like the old days,

14:38.333 --> 14:39.900
when people
didn't get divorced.

14:39.900 --> 14:42.900
The only way
out of marriage is death.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.333
'till death
do us part.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.200
Donald Groves.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.066
You killed your parents
and ate them, right?

14:52.066 --> 14:54.433
I only
ate my mom.

14:54.433 --> 14:57.066
I was saving my dad
for Thanksgiving.

14:57.066 --> 15:00.867
That's festive.

15:00.867 --> 15:04.333
What can you tell me about
Dino Ortolani's murder?

15:04.333 --> 15:07.066
I got in trouble for
sneaking into the morgue.

15:07.066 --> 15:10.166
What were you doing
in the morgue?

15:10.166 --> 15:12.600
I was just
looking.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.567
And they put you
in the hole?

15:14.567 --> 15:15.600
Yeah.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.133
And you were in the cell
next to Ortolani's

15:18.133 --> 15:19.367
when he got burned?

15:19.367 --> 15:20.400
Yeah.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.500
You hear anything?

15:22.500 --> 15:23.633
No.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.467
Not a sound.

15:26.934 --> 15:30.533
He didn't scream.

15:30.533 --> 15:33.233
He gets set on fire,
but he doesn't scream.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.266
That's balls.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.533
Anything else?

15:41.533 --> 15:44.000
I saw them
carry him out.

15:45.266 --> 15:47.367
Looked like
a roasted--

15:47.367 --> 15:50.367
broiled chicken.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.700
His flesh was all
brown and crispy.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.567
He looked
good enough to eat.

15:58.033 --> 16:00.066
(no sound)

16:21.700 --> 16:22.934
What's he saying?

16:22.934 --> 16:24.767
He's talking about
how taxpayers

16:24.767 --> 16:27.500
shouldn't have to foot
the bill for prisoner frills.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.133
Thank you,
Gov. Cocksucker.

16:29.133 --> 16:31.867
Therefore, I am introducing
to the legislature

16:31.867 --> 16:34.367
a measure which would
save this state

16:34.367 --> 16:37.400
an estimated
$3 million a year.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.667
This law would eliminate
all conjugal visits

16:40.667 --> 16:43.033
between inmates
and their wives...

16:43.033 --> 16:45.533
Get the fuck
outta here.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.100
Man:
Sonovabitch.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.600
Okay, guys,
listen.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.066
Hey, stop talking!

16:58.066 --> 16:59.533
If you don't
stop talking fast,

16:59.533 --> 17:02.400
I'm gonna hang up my
"out to lunch" sign.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.533
Now get,
get--

17:04.533 --> 17:06.200
Get in line!

17:06.200 --> 17:08.166
Alright, now,
thank you.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.867
Pass this on to
the fella in back of you.

17:10.867 --> 17:14.200
Take a pencil and start
filling out the forms.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.834
I have counted
all the pencils

17:15.834 --> 17:17.467
and I want 'em back.

17:17.467 --> 17:19.800
If you use any of them
as a weapon

17:19.800 --> 17:21.800
or if any of one of
them is missing,

17:21.800 --> 17:23.600
none of you
will get a visit!

17:23.600 --> 17:25.633
Am I making
myself clear?

17:25.633 --> 17:28.400
Because if not,
I will repeat myself.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.133
Man:
Yes,

17:34.133 --> 17:36.233
that's right,
honey.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.633
Yes!

17:52.767 --> 17:53.834
Yes.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.500
(police radio chatter)

18:16.266 --> 18:17.333
(sirens)

18:35.500 --> 18:36.600
Freeze!

18:41.567 --> 18:44.600
Freeze!
I got him!

18:44.600 --> 18:45.633
Fuck.

18:48.266 --> 18:49.200
Fuck.

18:51.734 --> 18:53.333
He's dead.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.066
You're gonna pay.

19:01.133 --> 19:02.867
No, no!

19:05.000 --> 19:06.500
Aah!

19:06.500 --> 19:08.166
(thud)

19:11.333 --> 19:14.433
Narrator: Prisoner number
9-5-H-5-2-2,

19:14.433 --> 19:15.900
Augustus Hill.

19:15.900 --> 19:17.600
Convicted
November 6th, '95.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.600
Possession of
illegal substances,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.467
murder in
the second degree.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.367
Sentence,
life imprisonment,

19:23.367 --> 19:25.400
up for parole
in 20 years.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.066
Hey, you believe
this shit?

19:27.066 --> 19:28.300
Word.

19:28.300 --> 19:32.033
I'm fiending
to see my wife.

19:32.033 --> 19:33.467
At least you'll get
to see yours.

19:33.467 --> 19:35.300
What you mean?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.433
Fucking part.

19:37.433 --> 19:40.467
You think 'cause
I can't walk, I can't fuck?

19:42.166 --> 19:44.467
So you can fuck?

19:44.467 --> 19:45.500
Yeah!

19:45.500 --> 19:48.266
Are we talking
getting hard

19:48.266 --> 19:50.367
or licky-licky?

19:50.367 --> 19:52.900
We're talking
in and out,
up and down,

19:52.900 --> 19:54.500
that's what
we're talking.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.467
Who'd have thought
a nigger

19:56.467 --> 19:58.467
could get hard
in a wheelchair?

19:58.467 --> 20:00.967
It's easier for
some of us than others.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.767
Some people
gotta use pumps,

20:02.767 --> 20:04.567
some niggers
gotta use drugs,

20:04.567 --> 20:06.400
get a needle
stuck in their dick.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.867
The worst one
is implants.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.500
They slice
your dick open

20:10.500 --> 20:13.333
and they lay in this
kind of like a steel rod

20:13.333 --> 20:14.667
to keep
the shit stiff.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.767
Oh, please.

20:16.767 --> 20:18.934
I get hard
the old-fashioned way.

20:18.934 --> 20:20.633
Good for you.

20:20.633 --> 20:23.133
The only problem is,
I don't know it.

20:24.533 --> 20:26.700
You don't know what?

20:26.700 --> 20:29.033
I don't know
when I'm hard.

20:29.033 --> 20:32.400
You don't know
when you're hard?

20:32.400 --> 20:34.400
I ain't got no
sensation down there,

20:34.400 --> 20:36.200
so I don't know
when I'm hard,

20:36.200 --> 20:37.433
I don't know
when I cum.

20:37.433 --> 20:40.233
My wife
gotta tell me.

20:40.233 --> 20:42.867
You don't know if you've cum?

20:42.867 --> 20:46.834
You don't get
any pleasure at all?

20:46.834 --> 20:48.567
What the fuck are you
doing it for?

20:48.567 --> 20:50.400
For her.

20:52.633 --> 20:55.266
You can take a lot of things
away from a man--

20:55.266 --> 20:57.767
cigarettes, the gym.

20:57.767 --> 21:02.033
You can take his freedom,
his legs...

21:02.033 --> 21:04.367
but not his
feelings.

21:04.367 --> 21:07.667
Not his feelings.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.400
That's it,
baby.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.300
Get this off.

21:13.300 --> 21:14.633
Pull, pull!

21:14.633 --> 21:16.667
Hill:
A man loves a woman.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.667
Don't matter
what kind of man he is.

21:18.667 --> 21:20.600
If he loves her,
he wants her.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.233
He wants her body,

21:22.233 --> 21:24.333
he wants her
to want his.

21:24.333 --> 21:26.166
So you say to him,

21:26.166 --> 21:28.467
you can never
make love again.

21:28.467 --> 21:32.033
You will never touch her
in that way again.

21:33.266 --> 21:35.500
This is the last time.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.667
The last time...

21:37.667 --> 21:40.000
forever.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.633
If that's not cruel
and unusual punishment...

21:47.200 --> 21:49.033
I don't know
what is.

21:51.633 --> 21:54.300
I'm investigating the
murder of Dino Ortolani.

21:54.300 --> 21:57.467
Lucky me, right?

21:57.467 --> 21:59.533
He used to supervise you
in the kitchen?

21:59.533 --> 22:01.300
Yeah.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.800
You ever have
any run-ins with him?

22:03.800 --> 22:04.900
No.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.000
No?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.200
He's ordering you
around all day,

22:08.200 --> 22:10.333
"Boy, do this,
boy, do that."

22:10.333 --> 22:12.100
That never
pissed you off?

22:12.100 --> 22:14.066
He never
called me "boy".

22:14.066 --> 22:16.633
He put your little brother
Billie in the hospital.

22:16.633 --> 22:18.734
He beat him
nearly to death.

22:18.734 --> 22:21.066
Ortolani was
a scum-fuck, man.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.433
You married,
Jefferson?

22:33.433 --> 22:34.767
What's that got
to do with anything?

22:34.767 --> 22:36.367
Answer the question.

22:36.367 --> 22:38.166
No, I ain't married.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.600
You got a girl waiting
for you on the outside?

22:40.600 --> 22:41.600
Yeah.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.433
She know you're
a lying sack of shit?

22:44.433 --> 22:46.467
Huh?

22:46.467 --> 22:49.266
If I find out you had
anything to do with this,

22:49.266 --> 22:51.367
I'm gonna bury you
so deep in gen-pop,

22:51.367 --> 22:53.133
she'll never see
your black ass again.

22:54.734 --> 22:56.900
What do I say
when they call me in?

22:56.900 --> 22:59.500
Say nothing, Johnny,
nothing.

23:00.767 --> 23:02.567
Yo, listen up.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.100
I'm gonna be running the
kitchen from now on, okay?

23:04.100 --> 23:06.300
Everything's gonna
be the same.

23:06.300 --> 23:08.300
'till we find out
who whacked Dino,

23:08.300 --> 23:10.133
we ain't selling
any contraband

23:10.133 --> 23:11.667
to anyone for
any reason, okay?

23:13.266 --> 23:15.834
I'm gonna set that wop
motherfucker on fire next.

23:15.834 --> 23:17.300
Shut the fuck up.

23:17.300 --> 23:19.000
I ain't afraid of
no fucking greaseballs.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.467
Shut the
fuck up.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.500
(speaking Arabic)

23:36.400 --> 23:38.000
Allah...

23:40.934 --> 23:42.567
Jefferson...

23:44.066 --> 23:46.400
the cops wanna
see me about Ortolani.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.800
Shh.

23:49.066 --> 23:50.934
What's up?

23:50.934 --> 23:52.800
I'm having
a visit with Mavis.

23:52.800 --> 23:53.800
What?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.734
My girl, Mavis.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.700
I called her,

23:57.700 --> 23:59.867
told her
I'd been missing her.

23:59.867 --> 24:02.667
She said she was
gonna stand outside.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.300
Holy fuck!

24:04.300 --> 24:07.600
I told her
I've been missing her body.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.900
Oh, shit,

24:09.900 --> 24:13.200
Jefferson,
you the shit.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.266
(crowd screaming)

25:00.000 --> 25:04.467
Prisoner number
9-7-K-1-8-6,

25:04.467 --> 25:06.734
Jefferson Keane.

25:06.734 --> 25:10.367
Convicted
May 14th '97,

25:10.367 --> 25:13.066
two counts,
murder in the first degree.

25:13.066 --> 25:15.767
Sentence,
life imprisonment

25:15.767 --> 25:18.133
without the
possibility of parole.

25:18.133 --> 25:19.133
Fuck!

25:19.133 --> 25:21.333
I wanna
get married.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.467
To anyone
in particular?

25:23.467 --> 25:26.333
Yeah,
my girl Mavis.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.600
Mavis wants to marry you
in spite of the fact

25:28.600 --> 25:30.567
that you're gonna be in here
for the rest of your life?

25:30.567 --> 25:32.033
Yeah.

25:32.033 --> 25:34.000
Sounds like
a remarkable woman.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
She is.

25:37.033 --> 25:38.033
Alright.

25:38.033 --> 25:41.033
I'll make
the arrangements.

25:41.033 --> 25:42.900
No, absolutely not.

25:42.900 --> 25:43.900
Why?

25:43.900 --> 25:46.834
This is a prison,
not the Elvis chapel.

25:46.834 --> 25:49.533
We got enough shit going on
right now as it is.

25:49.533 --> 25:51.500
A wedding might help
ease some of the tension.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.200
It might also
be perceived

25:53.200 --> 25:54.767
as a reward
for Jefferson Keane,

25:54.767 --> 25:58.200
who has done nothing
to deserve a reward.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.200
He's not
a model prisoner, no,

26:00.200 --> 26:01.900
but this could
help turn him around.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.967
The guy killed a couple
on their wedding day,

26:03.967 --> 26:05.667
shot them both down
in cold blood.

26:05.667 --> 26:07.567
He says the two of them
ripped off his package.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.333
And that
justifies it?

26:09.333 --> 26:10.400
No, it explains it.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.600
Leo, are you saying
you'd be okay with this

26:12.600 --> 26:14.000
if he'd waited 'till
after their honeymoon?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.567
Yeah!
Leo...

26:15.567 --> 26:18.200
Hey, I believe in the
sanctity of marriage.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.266
It's a holy ritual,
a sacred bond

26:20.266 --> 26:23.166
between a man,
a woman, and God.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.400
A marriage is when
a husband and wife

26:25.400 --> 26:28.333
live together in the same house,
sleep in the same bed.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.700
Jefferson Keane
and whatever her name is--

26:30.700 --> 26:31.700
Mavis.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.533
They can't do that.

26:33.533 --> 26:34.967
Their marriage
would be a fraud,

26:34.967 --> 26:36.066
and I'm not gonna be
a party to it.

26:36.066 --> 26:40.867
Keane lives in "Em City",
it's my decision.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.100
That's true,

26:43.100 --> 26:46.433
but the lobby
is under my jurisdiction,

26:46.433 --> 26:48.300
and you try and bring in
that bride-to-be

26:48.300 --> 26:50.100
through
the front door.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.700
They don't have a clue
what went down with Ortolani,

26:52.700 --> 26:54.400
so just chill
the fuck out.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.567
What about
the wise guys?

26:56.567 --> 26:58.333
They stopped everything.

26:58.333 --> 27:01.900
No more drugs, no more bets,
no more contraband.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.333
Ain't nothing moving
in any direction

27:03.333 --> 27:06.200
'till Nino Schibetta
gets satisfaction.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.233
McManus:
Jefferson!

27:10.500 --> 27:12.667
I spoke
to the warden.

27:12.667 --> 27:13.834
Yeah?

27:13.834 --> 27:16.934
He's not gonna give you
permission to get married.

27:16.934 --> 27:19.066
This is not to say that
he's not gonna change his mind,

27:19.066 --> 27:20.667
but I think
for now,

27:20.667 --> 27:22.600
we have to put this thing
on the back burner.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.367
We can't.
Why?

27:24.367 --> 27:26.367
'Cause I'm gonna
lose her.

27:26.367 --> 27:28.266
If she loves you
as much as you say--

27:28.266 --> 27:30.367
You promised me, McManus.

27:30.367 --> 27:32.633
now you're going back
on your fucking word.

27:32.633 --> 27:35.200
A man that can't keep his word
ain't shit with me.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.400
He ain't shit.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.867
I really appreciate
that you've come to me.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.100
It's just that
I love her so much.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.300
I'm sure you do.

27:45.300 --> 27:48.700
But your desire
to marry her,

27:48.700 --> 27:52.700
that can't
come out of your ego.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.533
It can't come out
of a jealousy.

27:54.533 --> 27:57.166
It can't come out of a fear
that because you are in here

27:57.166 --> 28:00.333
and you can't have her,
no man should.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.734
If you love her,

28:02.734 --> 28:05.467
you must be careful
that you do not deprive her

28:05.467 --> 28:07.266
of the fullness
of life.

28:07.266 --> 28:10.033
No, man,
I wouldn't do that to her.

28:10.033 --> 28:12.567
Okay.

28:12.567 --> 28:13.567
Okay.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.467
Now you've told me
why you love Mavis, right?

28:18.467 --> 28:22.467
Now you explain to me
how you know she loves you.

28:22.467 --> 28:24.600
Just the
little things.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.600
It's like,
at my trial,

28:26.600 --> 28:28.433
she was there every day.

28:28.433 --> 28:30.166
I mean, just seeing her

28:30.166 --> 28:32.567
made everything
so much easier for me.

28:32.567 --> 28:35.300
And her face--
I mean, her smile,

28:35.300 --> 28:37.266
it's like--

28:37.266 --> 28:39.834
Hell, I ain't got
the words like you.

28:39.834 --> 28:42.233
That's why I want you
to plead my case for me.

28:42.233 --> 28:44.333
I'll get you anything
you want up in here.

28:44.333 --> 28:45.900
You have
nothing I need.

28:45.900 --> 28:49.834
So what's that, a no?

28:49.834 --> 28:53.767
I believe that
you love each other.

28:53.767 --> 28:56.200
But you gotta
take that love, brother,

28:56.200 --> 28:58.734
and you gotta trust
in the will of Allah.

28:58.734 --> 29:00.533
Yo, my girl
is pregnant.

29:00.533 --> 29:03.767
I screwed her,
now Allah's screwing me.

29:21.333 --> 29:23.500
(inaudible dialogue)

29:28.734 --> 29:31.667
I decided to let
Jefferson Keane get married.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.734
Because?

29:33.734 --> 29:36.300
Kareem Said
came to see me.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.200
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

29:39.367 --> 29:42.133
I come to you
on Kean's behalf,

29:42.133 --> 29:43.667
you blow me off
in a cloud of platitudes.

29:43.667 --> 29:45.900
Now Kareem said says
God knows what to you,

29:45.900 --> 29:47.834
the clouds are parted,
the sun is shining.

29:47.834 --> 29:49.600
Do you realize
how this damages

29:49.600 --> 29:52.233
my credibility
with the inmates?

29:52.233 --> 29:54.166
So I shouldn't let 'em
get married

29:54.166 --> 29:55.300
for the sake
of your credibility?

29:55.300 --> 29:56.433
That's right.

29:56.433 --> 29:59.200
McManus, how often does
a guy like Said

29:59.200 --> 30:01.667
come to see us
to ask for a favor?

30:01.667 --> 30:04.900
Oh, I get it,
now he owes you.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.300
Yeah. He's gonna help contain
the Ortolani situation.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.233
He's gonna help
slow down the drugs.

30:09.233 --> 30:11.066
Which means nothing.

30:11.066 --> 30:13.667
Why didn't
you tell me

30:13.667 --> 30:16.900
that Jefferson Keane's
girlfriend was pregnant?

30:18.767 --> 30:20.600
Because
I didn't know.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.600
He didn't tell me that.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.567
So much for
your credibility.

30:25.567 --> 30:27.834
Man, this is
some bullshit.

30:27.834 --> 30:29.734
Jefferson,

30:29.734 --> 30:33.166
the warden was very specific
about how this is going to work.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.400
So what's
this proxy shit?

30:35.400 --> 30:37.133
You'll be here

30:37.133 --> 30:39.467
and your fiance

30:39.467 --> 30:42.100
will be at
your local baptist church.

30:42.100 --> 30:44.567
You'll both be exchanging vows
at the same time

30:44.567 --> 30:46.867
and each of you
will have

30:46.867 --> 30:50.033
someone standing in
for the other person.

30:50.033 --> 30:51.700
C'mon, Father.

30:51.700 --> 30:54.000
Don't this seem
fucked up to you?

30:56.400 --> 30:59.800
♪ If I should call you up,
invest a dime ♪

30:59.800 --> 31:02.300

31:17.667 --> 31:18.800
Yes.

31:19.867 --> 31:21.166
Shut the fuck up.

31:21.166 --> 31:23.967
With the power
vested in me.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.367
I pronounce you

31:26.367 --> 31:28.000
husband and wife.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.867
You're not gonna
kiss the bride?

31:33.834 --> 31:35.367
Kiss my ass.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.900
Congratulations, man.

31:38.900 --> 31:40.967
Hill:
For better or for worse.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.934
Shit, it don't get
much worse than this.

31:43.934 --> 31:46.166
Yo, man...

31:46.166 --> 31:48.867
got a letter
from Mavis.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.533
Hmm...

32:09.967 --> 32:12.667
It's the will
of Allah, brother.

32:12.667 --> 32:14.567
Asalaam alaikum.

32:14.567 --> 32:16.166
Asalaam alaikum.

32:18.567 --> 32:20.300
(knocking)

32:20.300 --> 32:22.000
What are you
doing tonight?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.166
Huh?

32:23.166 --> 32:25.333
I was
thinking maybe

32:25.333 --> 32:27.700
you'd come over
to my house for dinner.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.900
So you sleep here
at the prison sometimes?

32:30.900 --> 32:32.567
Believe me, I don't wanna.

32:32.567 --> 32:35.000
I've been doing double shifts
and I live two hours away,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.834
so by the time
I get home,

32:36.834 --> 32:38.066
I gotta turn around
and come back.

32:38.066 --> 32:39.233
Move closer.

32:39.233 --> 32:41.367
If I could, I wouldn't
have to do double shifts.

32:41.367 --> 32:43.800
I appreciate it, Leo.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.600
I can't.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.934
Too much work
to do, right?

32:49.934 --> 32:51.834
You can take a break
from saving the world.

32:51.834 --> 32:53.367
Even Jesus had supper.

32:53.367 --> 32:56.734
And right afterwards,
he was betrayed and crucified.

32:56.734 --> 32:59.233
I'll try not to
take that personally.

32:59.233 --> 33:01.400
You got a daughter,
if I remember.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.934
How does she feel about you
being gone for days on end?

33:03.934 --> 33:07.033
Please. We live
with my mother.

33:07.033 --> 33:09.033
Between the two of them,
I get the crap beat out of me

33:09.033 --> 33:10.266
every time I walk
through the door.

33:10.266 --> 33:11.700
C'mon,
get your coat.

33:11.700 --> 33:14.100
I can't,
I have a date.

33:14.100 --> 33:15.100
A date?

33:15.100 --> 33:16.367
Yeah.

33:16.367 --> 33:17.367
Oh.

33:17.367 --> 33:19.667
Is that so hard
to believe?

33:19.667 --> 33:21.667
Frankly, yes.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.100
I got a dick
like every other guy.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.300
You need to find a job
closer to home.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.400
I haven't looked?
There are no jobs.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.333
You think if the
Chevy plant was hiring,

33:30.333 --> 33:33.066
I would chose to to come here
and baby-sit these piss-pots?

33:33.066 --> 33:34.767
I have no choice.

33:34.767 --> 33:37.433
I'm just like
these inmates,

33:37.433 --> 33:38.834
trapped.

33:38.834 --> 33:41.567
McManus,
get a wife.

33:41.567 --> 33:43.300
I had a wife.

33:43.300 --> 33:45.200
From what I hear,
you had a nightmare.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.967
You been
checking up on me?

33:46.967 --> 33:49.667
Dinner, tomorrow.

33:49.667 --> 33:51.333
Yeah, you bet.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.166
Have a nice date.

34:10.734 --> 34:13.633
God made sunsets
full of color.

34:13.633 --> 34:17.233
And God made racehorses
that run in a flash.

34:17.233 --> 34:20.000
God made the orange,
the apple and strawberries.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.200
But God's
greatest creation

34:22.200 --> 34:24.133
is pussy.

34:24.133 --> 34:25.867
I don't mean to be
crude or nothing

34:25.867 --> 34:27.633
but you can have
all the sunsets,

34:27.633 --> 34:29.900
horses and
fruit there is.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.834
Just give me all
the pussy in the world.

34:31.834 --> 34:33.700
Fuck, I don't need
all the pussy.

34:33.700 --> 34:35.400
Just one a day,

34:35.400 --> 34:37.266
every day.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.533
Down, down!

34:47.533 --> 34:48.900
Get down!

34:48.900 --> 34:50.367
Miguel Alvarez,

34:50.367 --> 34:52.867
I'm Father
Ray Mukada.

34:52.867 --> 34:54.667
I'm one of
the prison chaplins.

34:54.667 --> 34:57.233
No shit.

34:57.233 --> 35:00.233
According to this file you're
about to become a father.

35:00.233 --> 35:03.000
You've got
a girlfriend, Maritza,

35:03.000 --> 35:04.734
she's an inmate
at Parker Women's?

35:04.734 --> 35:06.834
Yeah, we got
arrested together.

35:06.834 --> 35:08.900
Ain't that sweet?

35:08.900 --> 35:12.133
I can arrange for you
to be there for the birth.

35:12.133 --> 35:14.367
I don't give a shit
about shit like that.

35:14.367 --> 35:16.533
You'll probably
be paroled in two years.

35:16.533 --> 35:17.900
When you get out,

35:17.900 --> 35:19.133
you'll wanna be
a father to your kid.

35:19.133 --> 35:20.200
Is that right?

35:20.200 --> 35:22.867
See that guy
over there?

35:22.867 --> 35:24.967
That's my father.

35:24.967 --> 35:28.333
And up in some cell block
somewhere is my grandfather.

35:28.333 --> 35:29.834
So don't be giving
me none of your shit.

35:29.834 --> 35:31.233
I get it.

35:31.233 --> 35:34.266
You had a miserable
childhood, tough.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.500
But let me tell you something.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.667
You're still
responsible

35:36.667 --> 35:38.900
for bringing a new life
into this world.

35:38.900 --> 35:41.800
You are
responsible.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.166
The same way that
I'm responsible for you,

35:43.166 --> 35:44.967
for your soul.

35:44.967 --> 35:46.900
So get ready,
Miguel Alvarez,

35:46.900 --> 35:49.000
because I'm gonna be
over your shoulder.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.500
Comprende,
mi amigo?

35:54.533 --> 35:57.500
Hey, Ray,
you wanted to know,

35:57.500 --> 35:58.667
I just signed the papers

35:58.667 --> 36:00.467
transferring Miguel Alvarez
to "Em City".

36:00.467 --> 36:02.433
Miguel Alvarez.

36:02.433 --> 36:04.133
Another shining example

36:04.133 --> 36:06.233
of how well
the penal system works.

36:06.233 --> 36:07.967
Guy walks in
the front door

36:07.967 --> 36:09.467
and he gets
stabbed in the chest?

36:09.467 --> 36:11.633
Not to mention the fact that
his father and grandfather

36:11.633 --> 36:13.066
are both
inmates here.

36:13.066 --> 36:14.300
Yeah, I know.

36:14.300 --> 36:17.367
Maybe I should talk
to them both about Miguel.

36:17.367 --> 36:19.667
The kid's about
to become a father

36:19.667 --> 36:21.934
and he refuses to accept
any responsibility for it.

36:21.934 --> 36:24.867
Well, the granddad,

36:24.867 --> 36:27.633
Ricardo Alvarez,
is in solitary.

36:27.633 --> 36:30.066
And having a conversation
with the father,

36:30.066 --> 36:33.967
Eduardo,
is gonna be tough.

36:33.967 --> 36:36.367
Why, he's...

36:36.367 --> 36:37.700
belligerent?

36:37.700 --> 36:40.066
He has no tongue.

37:03.667 --> 37:06.667
Señor Alvarez?
I'm Ray Mukada.

37:06.667 --> 37:07.667
I'm the--

37:07.667 --> 37:10.266
I know
who you are.

37:10.266 --> 37:14.767
I'd like to speak with you
about your grandson, Miguel.

37:14.767 --> 37:16.400
What about him?

37:16.400 --> 37:20.600
He's an inmate
here now.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.200
I heard.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.567
Maybe you also heard that
he's about to become a father.

37:25.567 --> 37:28.066
His girlfriend,
who he was arrested with,

37:28.066 --> 37:31.166
is at Parker Women's.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.734
And?

37:33.734 --> 37:35.367
I'm trying to get Miguel
to accept the responsibility

37:35.367 --> 37:37.166
for raising the child.

37:37.166 --> 37:40.433
Maybe you can help me.

37:40.433 --> 37:45.300
Because I'm
his grandfather?

37:45.300 --> 37:48.433
I never even seen him.

37:50.867 --> 37:52.600
You were a shitty father,

37:52.600 --> 37:54.367
your son was
a shitty father.

37:54.367 --> 37:57.100
Don't you think it's time
we break the pattern?

37:57.100 --> 37:59.767
I was 18
when I was convicted.

37:59.767 --> 38:02.567
Eduardo was a baby.

38:02.567 --> 38:06.467
Next time I saw him,

38:06.467 --> 38:08.500
he was 18,

38:08.500 --> 38:11.533
and wearing the same
prison uniform I was.

38:11.533 --> 38:14.900
Then my son started

38:14.900 --> 38:17.767
mouthing off
at everybody here

38:17.767 --> 38:19.800
and making fun
of people,

38:19.800 --> 38:21.834
making threats.

38:21.834 --> 38:25.500
Then he started fucking around
and with a Haitian.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.533
And one night

38:27.533 --> 38:29.667
while Eduardo
was sleeping,

38:29.667 --> 38:32.166
the Haitian

38:32.166 --> 38:34.300
cut his tongue out.

38:34.300 --> 38:37.066
Yes, sir, I know,
I read the report.

38:37.066 --> 38:39.066
So you found
the Haitian

38:39.066 --> 38:41.233
and you cut
his heart out.

38:41.233 --> 38:42.667
Yeah.

38:44.100 --> 38:46.066
So what you're
telling me is that

38:46.066 --> 38:48.967
you were being a
good father to Eduardo

38:48.967 --> 38:51.533
when you carved up
the Haitian?

38:51.533 --> 38:53.533
Mm-hmm.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.066
If somebody
hurts your grandson,

38:57.066 --> 38:59.433
you won't be able to do anything
about it, will you?

38:59.433 --> 39:01.600
At least not that way.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.567
All I'm asking you
is to talk to the boy,

39:04.567 --> 39:06.467
not for you,
not for him,

39:06.467 --> 39:10.467
but for the baby
that's about to be born.

39:10.467 --> 39:13.800
Your great-grandchild.

39:34.967 --> 39:36.133
What the fuck?

39:40.934 --> 39:41.900
Come here.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.834
Who the fuck are you?

39:46.834 --> 39:47.900
Come here!

40:00.500 --> 40:02.433
Okay.

40:02.433 --> 40:05.233
I'm here.

40:05.233 --> 40:07.400
Now what?

40:22.867 --> 40:24.567
You know who I am,
don't you?

40:28.433 --> 40:29.934
Yeah.

40:37.266 --> 40:39.000
Sex is a mind fuck.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.133
A wad of jizz hits an egg
and bing-bam

40:42.133 --> 40:43.767
you're connected
to all these people.

40:43.767 --> 40:45.000
These strangers,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
who maybe got
the same eyes as you,

40:47.000 --> 40:48.834
the same
sort of nose,

40:48.834 --> 40:50.667
or maybe they
passed you some cell

40:50.667 --> 40:52.734
that makes you
drink or do drugs

40:52.734 --> 40:54.567
even if you
don't wanna,

40:54.567 --> 40:56.533
even if it's
killing you.

40:56.533 --> 40:58.367
These gene things
are like the shackles

40:58.367 --> 40:59.834
they put on us here.

40:59.834 --> 41:02.467
They're chains to keep us
from moving freely.

41:02.467 --> 41:04.667
You gotta be Houdini
to get out of them.

41:04.667 --> 41:06.900
You gotta be
fucking Houdini.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.800
Ortolani committed suicide.

41:31.800 --> 41:34.233
Suicide?

41:34.233 --> 41:36.100
How can he be tied down
in restraints

41:36.100 --> 41:37.467
and set himself
on fire?

41:37.467 --> 41:39.166
That's impossible.

41:39.166 --> 41:41.767
Even so,
he committed suicide.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.800
What makes you
say that?

41:43.800 --> 41:45.100
God told me.

41:45.100 --> 41:47.600
God told you?

41:47.600 --> 41:49.567
God comes to visit me
every once in a while.

41:49.567 --> 41:51.767
Actually, he comes
more often then I'd like,

41:51.767 --> 41:53.266
but he's God.

41:53.266 --> 41:56.066
What can I say, that I'm busy,
that I'm in the shower?

41:56.066 --> 41:57.200
He knows.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.800
We talking about
a burning bush here?

41:59.800 --> 42:02.100
No, it's more like a strobe.

42:02.100 --> 42:03.800
A little too flashy,

42:03.800 --> 42:05.533
a little cheesy
for my taste.

42:05.533 --> 42:08.467
And God told you
Ortolani committed suicide.

42:08.467 --> 42:10.900
Well, that the kid
wanted to die,

42:10.900 --> 42:12.500
and consciously or "un",

42:12.500 --> 42:14.800
he set up the circumstances
where he'd be killed.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.300
God happen to
tell you who did it?

42:17.300 --> 42:18.433
No.

42:18.433 --> 42:20.333
I didn't think so.

42:20.333 --> 42:22.333
But he told me
to tell you

42:22.333 --> 42:25.233
to tell Nino Schibetta
not to seek revenge.

42:25.233 --> 42:27.700
Why didn't you tell
Schibetta?

42:27.700 --> 42:31.600
Just 'cause I talk to God
doesn't mean I'm crazy.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.266
How's your mother?

42:33.266 --> 42:36.767
Not good, Poppa,
not good at all.

42:36.767 --> 42:38.300
Doctor says
she ain't got long.

42:38.300 --> 42:40.834
Who is this doctor?

42:40.834 --> 42:43.100
He's a specialist,

42:43.100 --> 42:45.400
the best.
I don't know.

42:46.533 --> 42:47.600
Is he Jewish?

42:47.600 --> 42:48.934
I don't know.

42:48.934 --> 42:50.767
His name's Dr. Bednarek,

42:50.767 --> 42:52.633
Dr. Russo
recommended him.

42:52.633 --> 42:54.200
Get a Jew.

42:56.900 --> 42:58.266
Hey...

42:58.266 --> 43:00.734
don't.

43:05.367 --> 43:08.266
Okay.

43:08.266 --> 43:09.800
What else?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.200
Dino's funeral's tomorrow.

43:16.233 --> 43:19.066
How are his parents
taking it?

43:21.433 --> 43:23.700
How do you think?

43:25.100 --> 43:27.767
Paolo is philosophical

43:27.767 --> 43:30.066
and Maria
wants revenge.

43:32.533 --> 43:34.033
Yep.

43:34.033 --> 43:36.166
Tell her
she's got it.

43:38.266 --> 43:40.066
Okay.

43:40.066 --> 43:41.633
Guard:
C'mon, Nino,
you know the drill.

44:18.033 --> 44:19.734
(police radio chatter)

44:32.200 --> 44:35.333
Prisoner number
9-5-S-6-0-4,

44:35.333 --> 44:36.967
Nino Schibetta.

44:36.967 --> 44:39.867
Convicted
December 12th, '95,

44:39.867 --> 44:42.567
two counts,
conspiracy to commit murder.

44:42.567 --> 44:45.767
Sentence,
120 years,

44:45.767 --> 44:48.266
up for parole in 70.

44:48.266 --> 44:50.100
I'm gonna
arrange for you

44:50.100 --> 44:52.333
to visit your wife
in the hospital.

44:52.333 --> 44:56.667
That's very
considerate of you.

44:56.667 --> 44:59.333
But, forgive me,
I'm cynical by nature.

44:59.333 --> 45:02.367
Why are you being
so considerate to me?

45:02.367 --> 45:03.934
It's hard enough
her being this ill

45:03.934 --> 45:07.233
without you
being able to...

45:07.233 --> 45:09.400
Say goodbye?

45:11.867 --> 45:13.800
What do you want from me?

45:13.800 --> 45:15.233
Your continued patience.

45:15.233 --> 45:17.300
You're gonna find out
who killed Dino.

45:17.300 --> 45:19.333
And you're gonna
bring him to justice.

45:19.333 --> 45:21.033
Now you're
laughing at me.

45:21.033 --> 45:23.633
As I said,
I'm a cynical bastard.

45:23.633 --> 45:25.500
No one wants a riot.

45:25.500 --> 45:28.066
True.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.033
I would like
to see my wife.

45:33.033 --> 45:35.233
Then we have a deal.

45:38.734 --> 45:40.166
No.

46:05.600 --> 46:08.633
Look, I know you're supposed to
be my sponsor and all that shit,

46:08.633 --> 46:10.700
show me the ropes.

46:10.700 --> 46:13.667
I don't need any help,
alright?

46:13.667 --> 46:15.934
O'Reily,
that's Irish, right?

46:15.934 --> 46:17.600
Yeah, you got
a problem with that?

46:17.600 --> 46:20.633
I run the
Aryan Brotherhood.

46:20.633 --> 46:23.000
And you're
doing a hell of a job.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.700
When we heard somebody
was transferring in
from the gen-pop,

46:25.700 --> 46:27.333
we all got
kind of curious,

46:27.333 --> 46:30.266
'cause it doesn't
happen that often.

46:30.266 --> 46:32.867
I saw you being
all pall-sy with that hack.

46:32.867 --> 46:34.600
Yeah,
I'm much loved.

46:34.600 --> 46:38.667
Yeah, you got friends.

46:38.667 --> 46:41.033
You got another friend
if you want.

46:42.867 --> 46:44.500
I'll see ya.

46:45.567 --> 46:47.500
Hey, by the way,

46:47.500 --> 46:49.333
whose cell
was this beforehand?

46:49.333 --> 46:51.533
Dino Ortolani's.

47:17.867 --> 47:20.233
Mr. Schibetta
requests your company.

47:40.867 --> 47:42.700
Thank you for coming.

47:45.934 --> 47:47.333
Sit.

47:57.700 --> 48:02.467
Dino Ortolani's death
has upset me very deeply.

48:02.467 --> 48:04.734
I am obviously

48:04.734 --> 48:08.300
hoping to learn
who killed him,

48:08.300 --> 48:10.834
especially in such
a hideous fashion.

48:10.834 --> 48:12.367
Has he gotta
be in here?

48:12.367 --> 48:14.567
Nick:
Joey.

48:19.266 --> 48:22.600
I know there was bad blood
between you and Dino.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.834
I didn't burn him.

48:23.834 --> 48:26.533
I'm not accusing,
I'm extending my hand.

48:26.533 --> 48:28.467
Dino is dead.

48:28.467 --> 48:30.734
Nothing can
change that.

48:32.500 --> 48:35.066
But if you could see

48:35.066 --> 48:37.767
a way to help us
find his murderer,

48:37.767 --> 48:40.133
I would show you
my appreciation,

48:40.133 --> 48:42.533
my forgiveness

48:42.533 --> 48:44.934
for your
past indiscretions.

48:44.934 --> 48:47.567
Honestly, I don't know
who offed Dino.

48:47.567 --> 48:50.333
And, with no disrespect,

48:50.333 --> 48:52.934
I can't say I'm
unhappy about it.

48:52.934 --> 48:55.767
But your friendship
would mean a lot to me.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.367
So if I hear anything,

48:57.367 --> 48:59.367
I'll come to you first.

48:59.367 --> 49:01.266
That's all I ask.

49:12.900 --> 49:15.667
He knows.

49:15.667 --> 49:18.600
Schibetta ain't gonna rest
'till he knows who done it.

49:18.600 --> 49:21.600
You wanna be around when
he finds out you were involved?

49:21.600 --> 49:23.400
We gotta give him
Johnny Post.

49:23.400 --> 49:24.700
Fuck that.

49:24.700 --> 49:26.734
We give him Post,
it all goes away.

49:26.734 --> 49:28.967
Maybe you micks
work like that,

49:28.967 --> 49:31.700
but I would never
rat on a brother.

49:31.700 --> 49:33.000
Then what do you
say we do?

49:33.000 --> 49:36.333
Chill 'till it fades.

49:36.333 --> 49:38.400
Sicilians
don't forget.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.867
Sicilians don't
let things fade.

49:49.734 --> 49:52.333
He's awful chummy
with the mullanja.

49:52.333 --> 49:54.033
Could mean nothing.

49:54.033 --> 49:55.533
You wanna
talk to Keane?

49:55.533 --> 49:57.233
Not yet.

49:57.233 --> 49:59.233
Get word to Burruano,

49:59.233 --> 50:02.900
he should bring O'reily in
for a little fishing trip.

50:02.900 --> 50:04.600
She's a hooker.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.600
She's a hooker,
I tell ya, I've been there.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.266
You're shitting me
about this.

50:08.266 --> 50:10.300
The St. Pauli sector
of Hamburg, Germany,

50:10.300 --> 50:12.066
is the red light
district.

50:12.066 --> 50:14.500
So you tell me what
a St. Pauli girl does

50:14.500 --> 50:16.600
after she takes off her apron.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.467
And I always thought
the little bitch

50:18.467 --> 50:20.500
was smiling
just for me.

50:20.500 --> 50:22.133
You got a cigarette?

50:22.133 --> 50:23.667
Yeah, sure.

50:23.667 --> 50:26.233
You don't know,
this ban against smoking--

50:26.233 --> 50:28.433
can you believe
that shit?

50:28.433 --> 50:32.734
Here's what we got on
Dino Ortolani's murder, Ryan.

50:32.734 --> 50:35.066
Jefferson Keane
and his crew did it.

50:35.066 --> 50:37.567
Really?

50:37.567 --> 50:40.367
Yeah. I don't know
which one lit the match,

50:40.367 --> 50:43.266
but it makes sense.

50:43.266 --> 50:45.500
Ortolani put
Kean's brother in I.C.U.

50:45.500 --> 50:47.467
That kind of thing don't
go unpunished around here.

50:47.467 --> 50:48.734
Uh-uh.

50:48.734 --> 50:50.300
What has me
fucked up is,

50:50.300 --> 50:52.867
who arranged for
the guy who did the deed

50:52.867 --> 50:54.433
to get in
the hole?

50:54.433 --> 50:57.400
That would have to be
a well-connected sonovabitch.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.300
Connected to
two officers on duty.

50:59.300 --> 51:01.567
The niggers could've just paid
a hack to let 'em in.

51:01.567 --> 51:05.266
No, an inmate
arranged it all,

51:05.266 --> 51:07.200
and now I know
who that inmate is.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.333
You do?

51:08.333 --> 51:09.567
Sure.

51:09.567 --> 51:11.533
The same guy
connected enough

51:11.533 --> 51:14.133
to get moved from gen-pop
into Emerald City.

51:14.133 --> 51:16.767
The same guy who Ortolani
shot in the chest...

51:16.767 --> 51:17.934
you.

51:17.934 --> 51:19.133
Me.

51:19.133 --> 51:20.900
You're kidding me,
right?

51:20.900 --> 51:22.333
Eventually,

51:22.333 --> 51:25.100
I'm gonna get the little fuck
who killed Ortolani

51:25.100 --> 51:27.333
and he's gonna
start singing,

51:27.333 --> 51:30.233
and the only name that
fucking nigger is gonna rap

51:30.233 --> 51:33.834
is the skinny-assed
white boy's.

51:33.834 --> 51:36.200
My advice to you

51:36.200 --> 51:38.333
is to give 'em up now

51:38.333 --> 51:40.266
or shut 'em up soon.

51:43.133 --> 51:45.133
Thanks for
stopping by.

51:49.133 --> 51:50.834
Mr. Schibetta,

51:50.834 --> 51:53.367
I know
who killed Dino.

52:09.734 --> 52:11.767
Can I help you?

52:11.767 --> 52:13.800
Black ten on the jack.

52:17.567 --> 52:18.567
Thanks.

52:18.567 --> 52:20.934
I'm very sorry, Nino.

52:20.934 --> 52:24.333
She's been sick,
you know...

52:24.333 --> 52:27.934
for the past year...

52:27.934 --> 52:30.900
cancer.

52:30.900 --> 52:34.834
So it's not
unexpected.

52:34.834 --> 52:37.200
But even so...

52:37.200 --> 52:39.900
Is there anything
I can do?

52:43.633 --> 52:47.133
I'm very grateful
for you concern.

52:47.133 --> 52:49.934
I'd just like to be alone
for a little while.

52:49.934 --> 52:51.266
Sure.

52:51.266 --> 52:53.500
Let me know if
you need anything.

52:58.867 --> 53:01.200
I'm sorry about
Ange, skipper.

53:01.200 --> 53:05.567
Such a good woman,

53:05.567 --> 53:09.834
such a patient woman.

53:09.834 --> 53:11.800
I'm not the easiest man
to live with, you know?

53:11.800 --> 53:13.667
Believe me,
I know.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.467
I want Angie's funeral
to be magnificent.

53:20.467 --> 53:25.000
I want a golden-bronze casket,

53:25.000 --> 53:26.900
red velvet interior.

53:26.900 --> 53:28.667
At the wake,

53:28.667 --> 53:30.767
I want,
on both sides of her,

53:30.767 --> 53:32.200
calla lilies.

53:32.200 --> 53:34.400
She held them
on her wedding day.

53:34.400 --> 53:37.867
Get that actor she likes
to be one of her pallbearers.

53:37.867 --> 53:39.133
Which actor?

53:39.133 --> 53:41.433
He's a big movie star,
what's his name?

53:41.433 --> 53:44.667
He was in that movie
where the thing blew up.

53:44.667 --> 53:46.834
I know who you mean,
tall guy.

53:46.834 --> 53:48.500
And Lena Horne.

53:48.500 --> 53:49.734
As a pallbearer?

53:49.734 --> 53:51.467
To sing a hymn.

53:51.467 --> 53:54.133
Tell the cardinal
to go easy on the incense.

53:54.133 --> 53:57.100
The smell makes,
makes my--

53:57.100 --> 53:58.934
Oh, Jesus, Angie!

54:12.367 --> 54:16.000
I'm gonna
ask you this once:

54:16.000 --> 54:18.333
Who paid you to kill
Dino Ortolani?

54:18.333 --> 54:20.667
Fuck you!

54:20.667 --> 54:22.667
Fuck you,
you fucking dago!

54:22.667 --> 54:25.767
Before I did it,
I fucked him up the ass.

54:27.867 --> 54:29.300
Kill him.

54:29.300 --> 54:31.834
Start with his dick.

54:36.834 --> 54:39.100
What the fuck
y'all gonna do, huh?

54:39.100 --> 54:40.700
Fuckin' dagos.

54:40.700 --> 54:41.734
Fuck you!

54:41.734 --> 54:43.900
Sex and death.

54:43.900 --> 54:45.333
They're different,

54:45.333 --> 54:47.233
but the same.

54:47.233 --> 54:49.367
To reach
that final moment,

54:49.367 --> 54:51.266
that climax,

54:51.266 --> 54:57.700
you gotta give up
control of your body...

54:57.700 --> 55:00.533
of your soul...

55:02.967 --> 55:05.767
Another inmate at
Oswald State Penitentiary

55:05.767 --> 55:07.100
was murdered yesterday.

55:07.100 --> 55:09.400
The second such incident
in as many weeks.

55:09.400 --> 55:12.266
John Post,
a drug dealer serving life,

55:12.266 --> 55:15.500
was found in a utility closet
at the prison, mutilated.

55:15.500 --> 55:17.367
His fingers missing

55:17.367 --> 55:19.433
and several stab wounds
to his heart.

55:19.433 --> 55:21.433
Authorities are
investigating both murders

55:21.433 --> 55:23.166
but still have
no suspects.

55:23.166 --> 55:24.700
In a related story,

55:24.700 --> 55:27.467
state legislators have
overwhelmingly passed a bill

55:27.467 --> 55:30.567
banning conjugal visits
between inmates and their wives.

55:30.567 --> 55:32.834
Gov. James Devlin
has hailed the vote

55:32.834 --> 55:35.567
as a victory
for law-abiding citizens.

55:35.567 --> 55:37.767
Hill:
And love?

55:37.767 --> 55:41.700
Well, if sex is sweet
and death is bitter,

55:41.700 --> 55:43.667
love is both.

55:43.667 --> 55:46.767
Love will always and forever
break your heart.
