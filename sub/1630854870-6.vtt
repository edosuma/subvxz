WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:05.038
Come on!

00:05.138 --> 00:06.206
No, no, Alyssa,
not here!

00:06.306 --> 00:07.707
Come on!
What are you worried about?

00:07.807 --> 00:09.843
We're not supposed to be here!
Let's go to like...

00:09.943 --> 00:12.212
the pond or something.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.951
Oh my God!

00:21.221 --> 00:22.689
Come on, let's go!

00:22.789 --> 00:24.591
Wait, what
do you think it means?

00:40.774 --> 00:42.876
So, what do you think?

00:42.976 --> 00:44.677
You hate it.
I knew it.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.513
I'll tell the designer
to start over.

00:46.613 --> 00:48.348
Will you stop?
I love it!

00:48.448 --> 00:52.285
It's chic, it's elegant,
it's professional.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.020
I can't believe
you pulled it off.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.588
Why, 'cause I'm not a techie?

00:55.688 --> 00:57.991
Or because I have
terrible taste?

00:58.091 --> 00:59.025
Don't answer that.

01:00.827 --> 01:03.063
- Oh!
- What is it?

01:03.163 --> 01:05.231
A new client.

01:05.331 --> 01:06.933
Des Lewis Jr.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.235
He says we went to
high school together.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.937
Huh, and you don't
even remember him?

01:11.037 --> 01:12.238
Not really, no.

01:12.338 --> 01:13.673
Although, to be fair,
I did block out

01:13.773 --> 01:16.376
- huge chunks of my teen years.
- Hm.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.211
He wants us to meet him
this morning

01:18.311 --> 01:21.281
at his family's business:
Link Estates Winery.

01:21.381 --> 01:22.549
Ugh!

01:22.649 --> 01:24.751
You know what they say
about local wines.

01:24.851 --> 01:27.020
"They" being
pretentious wine snobs?

01:27.120 --> 01:29.422
Mm-hm.
Oh, you know what?

01:29.522 --> 01:33.726
I am so glad that you used
my Elite dating profile picture.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.329
My dÃ©colletage looks fantastic.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.631
That's your
profile pic for dating?

01:38.731 --> 01:39.833
Ew!

01:39.933 --> 01:42.068
Since when are you on
"Elite Singles"?

01:42.168 --> 01:43.703
Since I got
the celebrity discount.

01:43.803 --> 01:44.938
Come on.
Let's go!

01:59.752 --> 02:01.988
Hm, this is
actually quite charming.

02:02.088 --> 02:04.524
I was expecting
something more podunk.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.594
Hm, let's be sure to not
put that in our online review.

02:07.694 --> 02:08.761
Good one.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.463
Alright, guys, you can
take care of the rest...

02:10.563 --> 02:11.431
Hey!

02:11.531 --> 02:13.333
Oh, I think
that must be him.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.235
Good God.
You blocked out that?

02:15.335 --> 02:17.837
Guess I should have paid
more attention in high school.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.539
Okay, I'll catch up
with you guys.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.341
- Darby!
- Hi!

02:21.441 --> 02:22.442
Hey!

02:22.542 --> 02:23.977
Welcome to Link Estates Winery.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.411
- Oh!
- Oh!

02:27.547 --> 02:29.349
Ah, you don't
remember me, do you?

02:29.449 --> 02:30.984
Of course I do!

02:31.084 --> 02:32.819
You're a terrible liar.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.487
Des, this is my mom, Victoria.

02:34.587 --> 02:36.789
Oh, no, no.
You must mean your sister.

02:36.890 --> 02:37.857
Ooh!

02:37.957 --> 02:39.526
Nice to meet you!

02:41.561 --> 02:42.862
Come on, I'll show you around.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.464
You've never been
here before, have you?

02:44.564 --> 02:46.566
No, I've been dying
to see where the famous

02:46.666 --> 02:48.835
Link Estates wines are made.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.237
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.173
Right this way.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.045
My dad, Desmond Sr.,

02:59.145 --> 03:01.648
started this winery
40 years ago.

03:01.748 --> 03:04.684
He came here as a migrant worker
and he wanted his own winery

03:04.784 --> 03:08.254
to really recognize the link
between the worker and the wine.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.491
So he started
Link Estates Winery.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.326
Sounds like a great man.

03:13.426 --> 03:14.427
He was.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.529
Uh, my sister and I
inherited the vineyard

03:16.629 --> 03:17.997
after he died last year.

03:18.097 --> 03:19.566
Oh...
I'm sorry for your loss.

03:19.666 --> 03:20.934
Of course,
you know what it's like.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.268
You, uh...

03:22.368 --> 03:24.204
you lost your dad just
before you moved here, right?

03:24.304 --> 03:26.606
Yeah, when I was a kid.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.341
It's nice of you to remember.

03:28.441 --> 03:29.742
Of course.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.077
I, uh...

03:31.177 --> 03:33.413
I really want to carry on
what he worked so hard to build.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.215
That's why I was so upset

03:35.315 --> 03:37.050
when the problems
started a few days ago.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.052
What kind of problems?

03:39.152 --> 03:41.120
Let me show you.

03:41.221 --> 03:45.391
Right this way.

03:45.491 --> 03:49.062
It's a bit of a walk.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.564
First, someone drained
one of these vats

03:51.664 --> 03:53.199
in our fermentation room.

03:53.299 --> 03:56.035
We lost over
$80,000 worth of wine.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.670
Could it have been an accident?

03:57.770 --> 03:58.905
I thought so too,

03:59.005 --> 04:03.543
but then two of our
summer interns found this.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.678
Well, that took an ominous turn.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.300
Hey, it's okay,
you're not in trouble.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.303
You sure you didn't see anyone?

04:30.403 --> 04:32.505
No, the cellar was empty.
It was just us.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.407
What time was that?

04:34.507 --> 04:36.909
Maybe around... midnight?

04:37.010 --> 04:37.877
Hm.

04:37.977 --> 04:39.512
We were just goofing around.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.047
Just goofing around, huh?

04:41.147 --> 04:43.116
This is Ronny,
our Master Winemaker.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.318
He's been working here
since I was 10.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.786
Victoria and Darby Spencer.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.788
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.924
Soph, what did I tell you about
coming in here after hours?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.293
Sorry, Dad.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.661
Come on, lovebirds.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.262
Help me scrub it off.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.564
Thanks, Ronny.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.001
Here, right this way.

05:02.101 --> 05:05.738
Ah!
The tasting room!

05:05.838 --> 05:07.807
So, that message...

05:07.907 --> 05:09.809
- Pay for what?
- Uh, no idea.

05:09.909 --> 05:11.644
But I'm hoping
you can figure it out

05:11.744 --> 05:14.247
before our annual buyers' gala
in two days.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.282
We can't afford for
anything to go wrong.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.984
- Buyers' gala?
- Yeah.

05:18.084 --> 05:20.653
Every year, we host
a night of music and dancing

05:20.753 --> 05:22.021
for our biggest clients.

05:22.121 --> 05:24.257
It drives the sales
for the entire year.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.826
But it's also a lot of fun.

05:26.926 --> 05:27.860
Sounds wonderful!

05:27.960 --> 05:29.462
You should come.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.698
Both of you.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.399
Oh, no, no.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.635
No, galas are not my thing.

05:35.735 --> 05:36.836
Nonsense!

05:36.936 --> 05:38.871
The Spencer Sisters
love a good party.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.406
We will be there. Great.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.343
Des, still waiting
on a few RSVPs.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.244
Also, send me your
draft opening remarks.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.548
I need to make sure that we're
not duplicating talking points.

05:48.648 --> 05:49.882
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.251
This area is closed
to customers until next week.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.986
Oh no,
we're not customers--

05:54.087 --> 05:56.189
This is, uh,
Darby and Victoria.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.024
This is my older sister, Karina.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.859
Don't mind her type-A rudeness.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.694
She was born that way.

06:01.794 --> 06:04.197
Ha-ha.
To what do we owe the pleasure?

06:04.297 --> 06:06.632
Darby and her mom
are private investigators,

06:06.733 --> 06:09.535
and I hired them
to look into the vandalism.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.504
Without checking with me?

06:11.604 --> 06:13.706
We gotta get on top of this
before the gala, no?

06:13.806 --> 06:16.275
- Of course, but--
- Our fee is reasonable.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.712
And you can claim it
as a business expense!

06:19.812 --> 06:21.347
Fine, whatever.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.516
Just run these things
past me next time.

06:23.616 --> 06:25.051
Do you have any enemies?

06:25.151 --> 06:28.187
Anyone who might not want
the gala to move forward?

06:28.287 --> 06:31.023
Maldorelli Wines
is our biggest competitor.

06:31.124 --> 06:34.260
They're big-brand mass producers
who want to acquire us, but...

06:34.360 --> 06:36.362
they're too corporate
to do something like this.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.630
Yeah, uh...

06:37.730 --> 06:40.066
What about Silver Phoenix?

06:40.166 --> 06:41.434
Who's that?

06:41.534 --> 06:43.035
They're a real estate
development company.

06:43.136 --> 06:46.305
They tried to buy the vineyard
to build a retirement village.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.108
Now, thankfully
that didn't happen.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.845
We'll check them out.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.391
You and Des
seemed to be hitting it off.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.126
He's our client, Mom!

07:07.226 --> 07:09.595
Doesn't Bryn Martell have
a saying about not mixing

07:09.695 --> 07:11.297
- business with pleasure?
- Perhaps.

07:11.397 --> 07:13.433
- But he wasn't wearing a ring.
- Oh, perfect!

07:13.533 --> 07:15.601
Let's just pay him the dowry
and get it over with.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.904
Hello!
Welcome to Silver Phoenix.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.540
Spacious suites,
premiere golf course.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.010
This is aging like royalty.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.045
So, how can I help?

07:26.145 --> 07:29.248
I am not quite ready for this,
but it sounds divine.

07:29.348 --> 07:30.683
Where is it being built?

07:30.783 --> 07:34.587
We just settled on a beautiful
property from a retired farmer.

07:34.687 --> 07:36.823
Because the original deal
fell through, right?

07:36.923 --> 07:38.458
With Link Estates Winery?

07:38.558 --> 07:39.759
I'm sorry?

07:39.859 --> 07:41.994
How do you know
about Link Estates?

07:42.094 --> 07:45.298
Well, my sister and I
are land developers,

07:45.398 --> 07:48.267
and we just acquired it
to build an industrial park,

07:48.367 --> 07:50.403
and we were doing
our due diligence.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.106
- Those people sold to you?
- They did.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.875
And they mentioned that you
were trying to broker a deal

07:55.975 --> 07:57.310
- with them as well.
- Trying?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.712
Oh, we had one.
Or so we thought.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.147
Well, what happened?

08:01.247 --> 08:03.649
Well, the sister
wanted to sell,

08:03.749 --> 08:05.051
the brother didn't.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.286
In the end,
we had to withdraw our offer.

08:07.386 --> 08:08.721
That must have been disappointing.

08:08.821 --> 08:09.722
Yeah.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.225
My boss wanted
to torch the place.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.860
But it worked out.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.830
We found a better piece of land
at a more affordable price,

08:17.930 --> 08:20.833
without all the drama.

08:20.933 --> 08:24.136
Listen, be careful of those two.

08:24.237 --> 08:28.741
I wouldn't trust them
until the ink is dry.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.745
Hello!
Welcome to Silver Phoenix!

08:32.845 --> 08:34.981
Do you get the sense
that there's more going on

08:35.081 --> 08:38.384
between our clients
than just sibling rivalry?

08:39.385 --> 08:40.586
I'm never gonna live here.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.622
Oh, you're gonna live here.

08:42.722 --> 08:43.856
And soon.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.558
Go!

08:48.661 --> 08:50.596
But everyone lives here.
Alyssa lives here.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.731
My friends.
I don't want--

08:51.831 --> 08:56.202
- I don't want to--
- I'll see you later.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.170
Ronny, hey!

08:58.271 --> 09:00.273
Do you know
where Des and Karina are?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.476
Uh,
now's not a good time.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.077
They're having some words.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.979
Whoa...
Does that happen a lot?

09:07.079 --> 09:09.081
It got worse
since their dad died.

09:09.181 --> 09:11.050
They can't seem
to agree on anything.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.085
Like selling the winery?

09:13.185 --> 09:14.854
Well, they--
they got past that.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.822
Now they're fighting
about operations.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.691
Des wants to continue
his father's practice

09:18.791 --> 09:20.192
of hand-picking the grapes.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.161
And Karina wants to automate?

09:22.261 --> 09:25.364
Automate, rebrand, expand.

09:25.464 --> 09:28.234
And to heck with
her father's legacy.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.902
How do you
feel about that?

09:30.002 --> 09:31.737
Not my problem anymore.

09:31.837 --> 09:34.373
I'm taking my family
to British Columbia.

09:34.473 --> 09:38.444
The vineyards out there are
doing some exciting things.

09:38.544 --> 09:39.612
That's a big move.

09:39.712 --> 09:42.148
It wasn't an easy decision.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.017
I started out as a grape-picker
when I was 14.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.119
And now you're
a master winemaker.

09:47.219 --> 09:49.055
That's very impressive.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.257
I owe it all to Desmond Senior.

09:51.357 --> 09:54.327
He taught me about farming,
the vines.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.364
He sent me to
the best wine-making school.

09:58.464 --> 10:01.567
If Karina goes through with her
plan to automate the harvest,

10:01.667 --> 10:04.470
wouldn't that put
the grape-pickers out of work?

10:04.570 --> 10:05.605
Some.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.440
But they wouldn't
vandalize the place,

10:07.540 --> 10:09.408
if that's what you're thinking.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.477
They're loyal to the family.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.079
They know that
they'll be taken care of.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.581
Ah...

10:15.681 --> 10:19.719
I gotta test the brix levels
in the latest batch of grapes.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.521
Feel free to talk
to the workers if you want.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.324
Bernard is the shift supervisor.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.960
Just look for the guy
in the green cap.

10:28.060 --> 10:32.298
- Okay.
- Thank you.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.667
Ronny seems convinced
that the workers are loyal,

10:34.767 --> 10:37.036
but I bet they're at least
anxious about automation.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.005
I agree.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.606
Oh my God, there's a green cap.

10:40.706 --> 10:42.274
I bet that's Bernard.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.877
Wait, stop.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.681
Did you just see that?

10:48.781 --> 10:50.850
Was he giving
them money, or what?

10:50.950 --> 10:52.084
I dunno.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.920
Let's follow him.

11:03.629 --> 11:07.199
Do you think you could have worn
something a little more stealth?

11:07.299 --> 11:09.869
At least I won't get shot
by a deer-hunter!

11:09.969 --> 11:12.471
You know,
Bryn Martell always says,

11:12.571 --> 11:14.373
"All paths lead somewhere."

11:14.473 --> 11:16.976
Pretty sure that's
just the definition of a path.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.078
Why would
he park so far away?

11:19.178 --> 11:20.413
Good question.

11:27.119 --> 11:28.621
Commercial license plate.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.057
A business owns that vehicle,
not Bernard.

11:32.324 --> 11:36.362
Seems like Link Estates
has a mole in their midst.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.540
What's with the box?

11:47.640 --> 11:50.276
It's not for me!

11:55.014 --> 11:58.184
Huh, it's from Des...

11:58.284 --> 12:01.654
thanking us for putting
so much care into the case.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.422
Thanking you, you mean.

12:03.522 --> 12:04.990
I'm sure it's meant
for both of us.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.826
Mm-hm!

12:06.926 --> 12:09.662
What?
So lovely!

12:09.762 --> 12:12.498
This from the woman who turned
her nose up at local wine.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.900
Yes, well...
you should thank him.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.469
- Send him a text.
- I will.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.504
Or maybe a "sext"?

12:18.604 --> 12:20.706
That's inappropriate
workplace chitchat.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.775
Don't make me call HR.

12:22.875 --> 12:27.113
I am HR!

12:37.857 --> 12:39.191
Hello, Bernard!

12:39.291 --> 12:42.061
You're a long way
from staff parking.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.195
Who are you?

12:43.295 --> 12:45.464
Des hired us
to look into the vandalism,

12:45.564 --> 12:47.533
so we're investigating
anything suspicious.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.602
Like the fact that
your truck is registered

12:49.702 --> 12:51.303
to Maldorelli Wine Corp,

12:51.403 --> 12:53.239
Link Estates'
biggest competitor.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.708
My friend on the force
ran your licence plate.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.443
So, what was your plan,
Bernard?

12:57.543 --> 13:01.280
Were you going to sabotage the
gala or steal all their clients?

13:01.380 --> 13:02.715
You got it all wrong.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.416
So Des and Karina know
that you're working

13:04.517 --> 13:05.718
for their competition?

13:05.818 --> 13:08.387
Okay, fine, yes,
I work for Maldorelli.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.890
They wanted me to convince
Link Estate workers to leave.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.958
Link Estates has
the best workers.

13:13.058 --> 13:15.361
They're one of the few wineries
that treats migrants fairly.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.097
And you saw an opportunity
to take advantage of that.

13:18.197 --> 13:19.398
And of them.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.233
If I bring 25 pickers aboard,

13:21.333 --> 13:24.303
I get promoted
to operations manager.

13:24.403 --> 13:25.905
You guys gonna rat me out?

13:26.005 --> 13:29.308
No, it'd be so much more fun
to watch you do it yourself.

13:29.408 --> 13:30.609
Fine.

13:30.709 --> 13:33.779
But tell the pickers
they're welcome at Maldorelli

13:33.879 --> 13:35.214
when they don't get
severance packages

13:35.314 --> 13:36.849
if Link Estates automates.

13:36.949 --> 13:38.617
Karina's not loyal to anybody.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.186
Just ask Ronny.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.655
Wait, Karina and Ronny
have issues?

13:42.755 --> 13:45.191
Last week they had
a huge fight in the main house.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.092
Next day, Ronny's leaving.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.528
You do the math.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.399
They didn't mention
that they had a fight.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.572
So great seeing you guys.
Have a great time.

14:06.912 --> 14:09.648
Looks like they're
throwing him a goodbye party.

14:12.718 --> 14:16.856
Hey, everybody, can I
have your attention, please?

14:16.956 --> 14:19.792
I'm looking forward to
new adventures with my family,

14:19.892 --> 14:22.828
but I'm also
leaving family behind.

14:22.928 --> 14:27.066
I'm so grateful to Desmond Sr.
for giving me my first job,

14:27.166 --> 14:30.369
and to Desmond Jr. for letting
you all have time off

14:30.469 --> 14:32.972
to do this little
surprise for me.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.207
Even though you know
how much I hate surprises.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.546
To the best damn crew
in the wine business.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.481
And to family!

14:50.389 --> 14:52.291
Hey, Ronny,
that was a great speech!

14:52.391 --> 14:53.726
But...

14:53.826 --> 14:56.896
I noticed that you left
Karina out of your thanks.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.497
Did I?

14:58.597 --> 15:00.900
Well, just an oversight.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.601
Was it just an oversight,

15:02.701 --> 15:05.204
or was it because you two
had a fight last week?

15:05.304 --> 15:07.039
You wanna talk about the fight?

15:07.139 --> 15:08.540
Go ask Karina.

15:08.641 --> 15:13.913
Leave me and my family in peace.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.547
You okay, Papa?

15:15.648 --> 15:18.150
I'm...
I'm fine, sweetheart.

15:21.887 --> 15:23.889
Looks like
we should talk to Karina.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.791
Definitely.

15:25.891 --> 15:28.093
No, these are
white wine glasses.

15:28.193 --> 15:31.397
I asked for red!

15:31.497 --> 15:33.632
Karina, you seem a bit tense.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.567
I need everything
to be just right.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.636
This is our
first gala without Dad.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.238
You sure that's it?

15:39.338 --> 15:41.073
Doesn't have anything
to do with the fight

15:41.173 --> 15:42.574
that you had with Ronny?

15:42.675 --> 15:44.343
Who told you about that?

15:44.443 --> 15:49.281
That is a private matter
between management and employee.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.984
You two were hired
to protect the family business,

15:52.084 --> 15:53.919
not poke your noses into it.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.220
Karina!

15:55.321 --> 15:57.456
I'm sorry, what's--
what's going on?

15:57.556 --> 16:00.459
Your detective friends
have crossed a line.

16:00.559 --> 16:01.860
That's what's going on.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.596
We heard that Ronny and Karina
had a fight last week.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.565
We thought it might have
to do with the vandalism.

16:06.665 --> 16:07.833
Something you're not telling me?

16:07.933 --> 16:09.301
Seriously, Des?

16:09.401 --> 16:11.370
Stay in your lane.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.940
The finances
are my responsibility.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.477
And you two are fired.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.747
Leave now or I'll have you
arrested for trespassing.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.594
Should we go back?

16:35.694 --> 16:38.063
Should we call Des and explain?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.598
Relax.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.767
Getting fired is part of life.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.903
It's best not to dwell.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.639
But what about the vandalism,
and the gala?

16:47.740 --> 16:50.142
Des and Karina
will come around.

16:50.242 --> 16:53.178
Well, at least Des will.

16:53.278 --> 16:57.783
But until then, I am gonna go to
Antonio's for a good cappuccino

16:57.883 --> 16:59.818
and get some pages done!

16:59.918 --> 17:02.321
Well, no, wait,
what am I supposed to do?

17:02.421 --> 17:03.856
Don't dwell, darling!

17:03.956 --> 17:08.894
Don't you have any hobbies?

17:25.644 --> 17:27.112
Oh!

17:27.212 --> 17:30.616
Cute!

17:43.128 --> 17:44.329
Excuse me.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.032
Excuse me,
can you tell me where is--

17:47.132 --> 17:49.368
135 and a half?

17:49.468 --> 17:50.669
Are you a mind reader?

17:50.769 --> 17:52.704
Oh, it's an Alder Bluffs thing.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.506
It's down the alley
and up the stairs.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.742
The GPS always gets it wrong.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.078
Thank you.
I have an appointment with--

17:59.178 --> 18:02.014
Sammy Sato?
The real estate guy?

18:02.114 --> 18:03.615
You really are a mind reader.

18:03.715 --> 18:06.618
Trivial knowledge
is my superpower.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.987
Okay, so superpower me this:

18:09.088 --> 18:13.058
what is parking enforcement
like around here?

18:13.158 --> 18:14.426
The machine wouldn't take my--

18:14.526 --> 18:16.395
Your platinum card?
I know.

18:16.495 --> 18:20.532
City Council thought it was
quaint to keep the coin meters.

18:20.632 --> 18:22.367
How did you know about the card?

18:22.468 --> 18:26.405
You drive an Audi R8 Spyder.

18:26.505 --> 18:30.242
Your keychain.

18:30.342 --> 18:33.879
- You're into cars?
- I am a mystery novelist, and...

18:33.979 --> 18:36.782
bad guys always drive good cars.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.117
Well, that can't be true.

18:38.217 --> 18:39.485
I'm a good guy.

18:39.585 --> 18:42.788
That's what
the bad guys always say.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.057
Here.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.192
But I charge interest.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.365
Thank you.

19:38.977 --> 19:41.847
Des!
What are you doing here?

19:41.947 --> 19:44.550
Exactly how I hoped a beautiful
woman would greet me.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.886
- Sorry. I meant--
- No, no, it's, uh...

19:47.986 --> 19:50.556
I wanted to apologize
for what happened after Karina--

19:50.656 --> 19:52.157
Ordered us off the property?

19:52.257 --> 19:53.492
Yeah, yeah.

19:53.592 --> 19:56.128
So I talked to her
about the fight,

19:56.228 --> 19:58.163
but she didn't tell me anything.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.766
And between that and her recent
obsession with automation,

20:00.866 --> 20:04.036
I'm thinking that we might
be in trouble financially.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.070
Oh, no.

20:05.170 --> 20:09.208
So I secretly
grabbed the ledgers.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.677
And the ledgers
come with takeout, I see?

20:11.777 --> 20:16.848
No, but the roti and doubles
are a bribe so you'll help me.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.918
Come on in.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.854
There were so many,
but her fingers were...

20:29.962 --> 20:32.231
See?
"Good guy" move.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.366
I never got a chance
to introduce myself.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.368
Billy West.

20:36.468 --> 20:40.038
Victoria Spencer.

20:40.138 --> 20:41.707
How was your meeting?

20:41.807 --> 20:43.108
- It was good.
- Hm!

20:43.208 --> 20:46.878
There are more interesting
prospects here than I thought.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.748
Are you planning on
moving here, Mr. West?

20:52.451 --> 20:54.419
Thinking about it.

20:54.519 --> 20:55.988
Hm.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.624
Am I witnessing
the birth of one of your...

20:58.724 --> 21:00.959
Bryn Martell mystery novels?

21:01.059 --> 21:05.697
And how would you know that?

21:05.797 --> 21:08.000
You're on a laptop
in the middle of the day

21:08.100 --> 21:09.835
in a cafe in Alder Bluffs.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.671
You study people
as they're going by.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.473
You make notes...

21:14.573 --> 21:17.876
and you talk to yourself
when you type.

21:17.976 --> 21:19.044
Am I close?

21:19.144 --> 21:20.312
So close.

21:20.412 --> 21:22.547
But you Googled me.

21:22.648 --> 21:25.350
You did.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.752
I should have known better

21:26.852 --> 21:31.156
than to try and fool
the world's greatest detective.

21:31.256 --> 21:33.392
Do you want to join me
for some coffee?

21:33.492 --> 21:35.494
I'd love to.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.270
Something in here has to
explain the secret fight

21:45.370 --> 21:46.505
between Ronny and Karina.

21:46.605 --> 21:48.173
Maybe she wasn't
paying him properly?

21:48.273 --> 21:49.341
Ah...

21:49.441 --> 21:52.644
Payroll looks fine.
And, from what I know,

21:52.744 --> 21:54.746
Ronny's never been
that focused on money.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.982
What about equipment?
Or supplies?

21:57.082 --> 21:59.184
Maybe she wasn't giving him
the tools that he needed?

21:59.284 --> 22:00.385
Mm...

22:00.485 --> 22:03.255
No, I'd know about it.
And frankly, Karina wouldn't.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.357
Her domain is strictly finances.

22:05.457 --> 22:09.695
You guys have
very clearly defined roles.

22:09.795 --> 22:12.864
My dad wanted me
to take care of production.

22:12.964 --> 22:15.167
Or, uh, maybe he just
didn't want me doing the books.

22:15.267 --> 22:19.004
At any rate, he made
the financials her thing.

22:19.104 --> 22:23.275
She would be furious
if she knew we were doing this.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.177
- Yikes.
- Mm-hm.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.080
You guys fight a lot?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.382
She resents that Dad only
taught her the "boring" part

22:30.482 --> 22:32.584
of the business.
But that is her turf,

22:32.684 --> 22:35.987
and she is very territorial.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.522
Anyways...

22:37.622 --> 22:39.024
This is a real wake-up call

22:39.124 --> 22:41.159
that I shouldn't bury
my head in the grapes.

22:41.259 --> 22:42.661
Don't be so tough on yourself.

22:42.761 --> 22:45.497
Running a business
is a lot harder than it looks.

22:45.597 --> 22:48.667
Especially when
family is involved.

22:48.767 --> 22:52.037
Trust me, I know.

22:52.137 --> 22:54.373
Mm, your favourite beach?

22:54.473 --> 22:55.574
Oh, that's easy.

22:55.674 --> 22:57.976
Kaanapali Beach, Maui.
You?

22:58.076 --> 23:00.979
Hawaii, Hapuna Beach,
on the Big Island.

23:01.079 --> 23:03.281
So beautiful.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.050
What's your favourite trip?

23:05.150 --> 23:07.819
June, 2006, Portugal.

23:07.919 --> 23:09.221
Battle of Nuremberg.

23:09.321 --> 23:10.789
Soccer match of the century.

23:10.889 --> 23:11.890
We just missed each other!

23:11.990 --> 23:13.658
I was on a book tour
in Portugal,

23:13.759 --> 23:16.428
and two weeks later, that's
all anybody could talk about!

23:16.528 --> 23:18.096
A soccer match!

23:18.196 --> 23:20.098
Yeah!
Okay, I got one, I got one.

23:20.198 --> 23:24.002
Best place for
a soul-rejuvenating retreat?

23:24.102 --> 23:25.270
Buenos Aires.

23:25.370 --> 23:26.571
- Get out!
- Yeah!

23:26.671 --> 23:27.939
- Same.
- No!

23:28.039 --> 23:29.875
I'm a little bit of
a cliche, though,

23:29.975 --> 23:31.777
'cause I actually took
tango lessons there.

23:31.877 --> 23:35.414
I found the best little
milonga in Palermo...

23:35.514 --> 23:36.948
Jorge's?

23:37.048 --> 23:39.184
Yes!
Have you been there?

23:39.284 --> 23:40.719
- Yes!
- Come on.

23:40.819 --> 23:42.721
I loved taking lessons there.

23:42.821 --> 23:44.523
I wasn't very good, but...

23:44.623 --> 23:47.058
remember he had
everyone call him...

23:47.159 --> 23:48.860
Numero Uno!

23:48.960 --> 23:51.430
Fantastico!

23:51.530 --> 23:55.500
It's so fun to talk to
someone so well-travelled.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.370
You must be anxious
to get back on the road.

23:58.470 --> 24:02.140
Actually, I kinda like it here.

24:04.843 --> 24:07.379
There weren't
any cool takeout places

24:07.479 --> 24:08.914
when I lived in Alder Bluffs.

24:09.014 --> 24:11.049
Well, the town has changed
a lot since you left.

24:11.149 --> 24:14.052
Gotten way, way cooler.

24:14.152 --> 24:15.787
Since I left, or because I left?

24:15.887 --> 24:16.922
Don't answer that!

24:17.022 --> 24:19.291
I won't!

24:19.391 --> 24:20.625
I wanted to say...

24:20.725 --> 24:23.795
I was hoping that you'd
still come to the gala.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.964
You know, for the case.

24:26.064 --> 24:28.333
- For the case...?
- Mm-hm.

24:28.433 --> 24:31.369
- Okay.
- Yeah?

24:31.470 --> 24:35.474
I mean, there is a lot
riding on the event.

24:35.574 --> 24:36.708
I...

24:36.808 --> 24:38.510
I don't want to sound lame,

24:38.610 --> 24:41.613
but I don't want
to let my dad down.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.014
That's not lame at all.

24:43.114 --> 24:44.749
- No?
- Mm-mm.

24:44.850 --> 24:46.818
Plus...

24:46.918 --> 24:51.923
I wouldn't mind spending
some more time with you.

24:52.023 --> 24:54.125
I'd like that.

25:21.286 --> 25:23.488
Mmm...

25:29.094 --> 25:31.129
Des?
Hi!

25:31.229 --> 25:32.597
- Wake up!
- Oh, hey.

25:32.697 --> 25:33.865
- Hey, sexy.
- No, no, no.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.801
No, no, you have to go.
Pronto!

25:36.902 --> 25:39.437
Before my mom sees you.

25:44.442 --> 25:47.145
Yeah, grab the trellis,
hit the rail, and jump.

25:47.245 --> 25:48.713
I used to do it all the time.

25:48.813 --> 25:50.582
You're cute, Darby,
but there is no way

25:50.682 --> 25:52.817
I'm sneaking out the window
like a teenager.

25:52.918 --> 25:53.919
You have to!

25:54.019 --> 25:56.021
I'm an adult, fully grown man.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.089
I can say good morning
to Victoria and, you know,

25:58.189 --> 26:00.058
just go out the front door.

26:00.158 --> 26:01.459
No, you can't.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.761
Definitely not.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.829
I'll never hear the end of it
if she sees

26:04.930 --> 26:07.265
that I slept with a client
and witnesses the walk of shame.

26:07.365 --> 26:08.567
Oh!
Shame, huh?

26:08.667 --> 26:10.335
No, I'm--
I'm not ashamed.

26:10.435 --> 26:13.371
I'm... shame-free.

26:13.471 --> 26:15.407
You shouldn't be ashamed.
It's not shameful.

26:15.507 --> 26:16.374
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh, yeah.

26:16.474 --> 26:18.310
- Wow.
- But, you know, no, no.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.612
You are cute
when you're flustered.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.681
- And you are...
- I'm what?

26:22.781 --> 26:25.417
Way too enthusiastic
in the morning.

26:25.517 --> 26:28.386
- Hit the bricks, wine man!
- Oh!

26:30.355 --> 26:31.590
Okay.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.426
If you push the thumb-latch
on the door handle,

26:34.526 --> 26:36.728
it won't click
when you close it.

26:36.828 --> 26:38.396
So it won't make a noise.

26:38.496 --> 26:40.532
Oh, and put your truck
in neutral

26:40.632 --> 26:42.801
so you can just roll out
real quietly, you know?

26:42.901 --> 26:44.769
Roll out...
Okay, yeah.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.673
Okay, I'll see you
at the gala later.

26:48.773 --> 26:49.774
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:49.874 --> 26:51.176
I'll smooth everything over
with Karina.

26:51.276 --> 26:55.947
Sounds great.
Okay, just... 'kay!

26:56.047 --> 26:57.048
Whoa!

26:57.148 --> 26:59.584
Good morning!
What are you doing up so early?

26:59.684 --> 27:02.587
I... thought I heard a noise,
so I wanted to check it out.

27:02.687 --> 27:03.788
I thought it might be...

27:03.888 --> 27:05.557
raccoons.

27:05.657 --> 27:09.094
You had a late night writing!
I didn't hear you come in.

27:09.194 --> 27:11.663
As a matter of fact,
I did have a late night.

27:11.763 --> 27:14.099
But I wasn't writing.
I met someone.

27:14.199 --> 27:17.102
- Oh!
- Mm-hm.

27:17.202 --> 27:19.971
Yes, and then I came home
and I saw the takeout--

27:20.071 --> 27:21.406
great place, by the way--

27:21.506 --> 27:24.275
and the ledger
from Link Estates... hm?

27:24.376 --> 27:25.610
I'm sorry.

27:25.710 --> 27:28.346
I meant to clean up
the mess before...

27:28.446 --> 27:29.814
Bef...

27:29.914 --> 27:31.983
Des came over
and he brought the ledgers,

27:32.083 --> 27:35.153
and we had a quick bite,
and then he left.

27:35.253 --> 27:36.988
Last night.

27:37.088 --> 27:38.690
Before I went to sleep...

27:38.790 --> 27:41.259
alone.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.795
- So we're back on the case?
- Yes.

27:43.895 --> 27:48.133
Des wants me-- he wants us--
to go to the gala later.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.100
Huh!

27:49.200 --> 27:50.769
Well, good thing,
because I found some

27:50.869 --> 27:52.037
very interesting things
in that ledger.

27:52.137 --> 27:53.338
- You did?
- Yes.

27:53.438 --> 27:56.074
There is a recurring
$6,000 payment

27:56.174 --> 27:59.678
that doesn't seem
to match anything.

27:59.778 --> 28:00.979
Hm.

28:01.079 --> 28:03.148
I'll tell you all about it
once you get cleaned up.

28:03.248 --> 28:05.216
Hm.
Okay.

28:05.316 --> 28:07.719
Oh, and Darby?

28:07.819 --> 28:10.622
By the way,
I think the raccoon left this.

28:10.722 --> 28:13.024
Ugh!

28:13.124 --> 28:14.926
Give!

28:21.633 --> 28:23.835
So, all of their expenditures

28:23.935 --> 28:26.971
are linked to
specific categories:

28:27.072 --> 28:30.108
Payroll, Maintenance,
Supplies, etc...

28:30.208 --> 28:32.177
Except for the $6,000 payment;

28:32.277 --> 28:35.847
it's just listed
under "Other Costs."

28:35.947 --> 28:37.849
So how do we figure out
what it's for?

28:37.949 --> 28:39.584
Well, let's visit
the bank manager

28:39.684 --> 28:40.919
for Link Estates.

28:41.019 --> 28:44.022
Maybe they can tell us
who owns that numbered account.

28:44.122 --> 28:45.457
That's private information.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.158
We should probably get it
from Karina's office.

28:47.258 --> 28:50.328
Oh, well,
now you are thinking like a PI!

28:54.933 --> 28:57.035
Hi, Des!

28:57.135 --> 28:58.369
Oh, no!

28:58.470 --> 29:00.839
This morning?

29:00.939 --> 29:02.307
Text me a pic, okay?

29:02.407 --> 29:04.409
We'll get on it.

29:04.509 --> 29:05.710
Great.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.548
- Wow.
- The vandal's getting bolder.

29:11.616 --> 29:13.518
All the more reason
to go to the gala

29:13.618 --> 29:15.487
and break into Karina's office.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.555
And I'm gonna
meet my date there.

29:17.655 --> 29:19.524
When did you have time
to make a date?

29:19.624 --> 29:21.493
I might have texted him
after I found out

29:21.593 --> 29:22.727
that we had been rehired.

29:22.827 --> 29:24.229
Is this the someone
from last night?

29:24.329 --> 29:26.164
- Maybe.
- Wow, Mom!

29:26.264 --> 29:27.532
You're not wasting any time.

29:27.632 --> 29:29.067
Come on!
Let's get ready.

29:29.167 --> 29:32.203
I've got the perfect thing
for you to wear.

29:32.303 --> 29:34.539
Oh, boy...

29:51.556 --> 29:53.758
Hm, this is nice!

29:53.858 --> 29:55.460
Yeah.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.096
Okay, let's review the plan.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.431
I will distract Des and Karina;

30:00.532 --> 30:03.601
you'll go upstairs and look for
evidence in Karina's office.

30:03.701 --> 30:05.370
Why can't I distract them?

30:05.470 --> 30:08.072
Because you won't be able to
concentrate when you see Des.

30:08.173 --> 30:09.908
Oh, please!
Don't be ridiculous.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.177
I'm an adult.
I'm fully capable of...

30:12.277 --> 30:14.579
Whoa!

30:14.679 --> 30:17.749
See?
I rest my case.

30:17.849 --> 30:20.552
So, you do your thing...

30:20.652 --> 30:22.854
I see Karina.

30:26.057 --> 30:27.592
One second.

30:27.692 --> 30:30.829
- Hello!
- Hi!

30:30.929 --> 30:33.331
You are simply breathtaking.

30:33.431 --> 30:35.366
You're not so bad yourself.

30:35.466 --> 30:37.468
Uh, can I get you a drink?

30:37.569 --> 30:38.570
Yeah, that'd be great.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.606
I just have to, um...

30:41.706 --> 30:44.042
what's the cutest way to say
"empty my bladder"?

30:44.142 --> 30:45.977
I think you just nailed it.

30:46.077 --> 30:48.847
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Alright.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.256
So, um...

30:58.356 --> 30:59.624
I love the flowers.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.292
So festive.

31:01.392 --> 31:02.627
These especially.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.963
- Um, they're beautiful.
- Yes.

31:05.063 --> 31:08.800
And I was just...
wanting to thank you

31:08.900 --> 31:10.935
for inviting us
to your wonderful gala.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.539
And I'm so sorry about all
of the unpleasantness before.

31:14.639 --> 31:17.942
- Okay, it's fine.
- Well, thank you.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.178
It's lovely.
I wanted to try your, um...

31:20.278 --> 31:21.613
What wine is this?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.214
- The MÃ©ritage.
- MÃ©ritage!

31:23.314 --> 31:25.083
- Mm-hm.
- Delicious, I bet.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.589
Okay...

31:40.231 --> 31:42.533
Um, HR...

31:42.634 --> 31:44.435
So, organic, hand-picked,

31:44.535 --> 31:46.004
what else can you tell me
about your grapes?

31:46.104 --> 31:47.405
I'm sorry, would you excuse me?

31:47.505 --> 31:48.940
There's a client
I need to speak to.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.608
Oh, uh, cheers!

31:50.708 --> 31:52.944
Cheers.

31:55.847 --> 31:58.917
Good afternoon.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.218
Billy!

32:00.318 --> 32:01.552
You came!

32:03.621 --> 32:04.956
Oh my...

32:07.959 --> 32:09.560
Did you ask them to play this?

32:09.661 --> 32:12.697
I swear, it wasn't me.

32:12.797 --> 32:13.898
But...

32:13.998 --> 32:18.903
may I have the pleasure
of this dance?

32:19.003 --> 32:22.173
Okay, but be gentle.
I'm a little rusty.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.376
I highly doubt that.

32:38.156 --> 32:41.092
Miscellaneous expenses...

32:44.395 --> 32:47.899
$6,000...

32:47.999 --> 32:50.935
Gloria Williams...?

33:28.206 --> 33:32.143
W...
Gloria Williams.

33:37.915 --> 33:41.319
"My dearest Desmond,
I miss you so much.

33:41.419 --> 33:44.455
"I cherish every moment
we spend together."

33:44.555 --> 33:48.026
Huh, definitely his mistress.

33:55.199 --> 33:59.470
Hello, Gloria.

34:18.423 --> 34:20.058
- I have to go.
- What's wrong?

34:20.158 --> 34:22.193
I think my daughter's in danger.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.929
I have to check on her!

34:30.068 --> 34:33.004
Karina,
you have to come quick!

34:33.104 --> 34:34.839
What is it?
It's awful!

34:34.939 --> 34:37.508
A bartender didn't notice
that the wine was corked,

34:37.608 --> 34:39.710
and now someone is serving
your guests corked wine!

34:39.811 --> 34:43.281
- Oh, no!
- Yes

34:46.818 --> 34:49.654
Corked wine!
That's bad, right?

34:49.754 --> 34:52.156
That was close!
Did you find anything?

34:52.256 --> 34:53.991
Yeah, the payments
went to a woman named

34:54.092 --> 34:55.993
Gloria Williams, his mistress.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.095
I knew it!

34:57.195 --> 34:59.430
Mystery payments
always equal mistress!

34:59.530 --> 35:00.531
It's more than that.

35:00.631 --> 35:02.767
The $6,000 a month
didn't just go to Gloria.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.069
It went to Gloria's son too. Look.

35:05.169 --> 35:07.205
Ronny Williams,
the master winemaker,

35:07.305 --> 35:10.541
- is Desmond Sr.'s son!
- Whoa...

35:10.641 --> 35:14.378
Then he must be Des
and Karina's half-brother.

35:14.479 --> 35:16.247
We've gotta talk to him.

35:24.422 --> 35:26.290
Ronny?
There you are.

35:26.390 --> 35:28.192
Oh, hey.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.128
I come here to chill sometimes.

35:30.228 --> 35:32.230
- Mm.
- Helps me when I'm stressed.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.831
Stressed about leaving?

35:33.931 --> 35:36.200
It's... it's bittersweet.

35:36.300 --> 35:40.538
Especially since it's your
father's winery as well.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.173
How'd you know that?

35:42.273 --> 35:45.176
Well, isn't this
a picture of your mother

35:45.276 --> 35:49.380
and Desmond Sr.?

35:49.480 --> 35:51.949
How did you find out?

35:52.049 --> 35:54.785
My mom passed
a couple months ago.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.320
When I went through
her stuff, I...

35:56.420 --> 35:58.789
I found all kinds of payments
from the winery.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.659
So you went to the person
that keeps the winery's books?

36:01.759 --> 36:04.262
I figured Karina must know
since the payments continued

36:04.362 --> 36:05.596
after Desmond Sr. passed.

36:05.696 --> 36:07.098
Hm.

36:07.198 --> 36:11.068
She offered me $50,000 to leave
and not say anything to Des.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.105
So $50,000 wasn't enough?

36:14.205 --> 36:15.706
It wasn't about money.

36:15.806 --> 36:18.809
It was about being
treated like a dirty secret.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.845
With the amount
of times we spent together,

36:20.945 --> 36:22.613
the amount
I've done for her family,

36:22.713 --> 36:24.081
and that was her reaction?

36:24.182 --> 36:26.250
Okay, you have
every right to be angry.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.987
I'm sure that Des
will not press charges, okay?

36:30.087 --> 36:33.224
What?!
I didn't vandalize the winery!

36:33.324 --> 36:35.826
I was mad at Karina
for how she handled things,

36:35.927 --> 36:38.329
mad at my mom for lying,
but then...

36:38.429 --> 36:42.066
You remembered that Desmond Sr.
was good to you?

36:42.166 --> 36:44.936
He was being my dad.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.437
The best way he could.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.139
So you didn't do it?

36:48.239 --> 36:51.943
Shattered glasses,
spray-painted graffiti,

36:52.043 --> 36:53.010
it's all so immature.

36:53.110 --> 36:56.347
So... juvenile.

36:56.447 --> 36:57.815
Okay, where's Sophy?

36:57.915 --> 36:59.650
I don't know.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.587
Darby, where are you?

37:02.687 --> 37:04.755
I'm in the fermentation
room looking for Ronny.

37:04.855 --> 37:07.091
Des said he couldn't
believe it's him.

37:07.191 --> 37:08.659
Well, it's not.
It's Sophy.

37:08.759 --> 37:09.827
Wait, what?

37:12.730 --> 37:14.732
Oh my God.

37:14.832 --> 37:16.867
What?

37:16.968 --> 37:20.471
Gasoline.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.340
She's here.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.110
In the fermentation room!

37:26.210 --> 37:28.579
We'll be right there.

37:30.881 --> 37:33.284
- Don't do it!
- Stop!

37:33.384 --> 37:35.353
Everyone wants
this to turn around.

37:35.453 --> 37:36.454
They're on your side.

37:36.554 --> 37:38.422
- No, they're not!
- Yes, they are, believe me!

37:38.522 --> 37:39.724
Seriously,
don't come any closer!

37:39.824 --> 37:42.059
- I just want to talk to you.
- I'm sick of talking!

37:42.159 --> 37:43.494
Stop!

37:43.594 --> 37:45.129
- Don't--
- Sophy, don't!

37:45.229 --> 37:46.397
They deserve it!

37:46.497 --> 37:47.999
They took everything from you!

37:48.099 --> 37:50.234
- From our whole family!
- No, honey!

37:50.334 --> 37:52.036
I heard you and Karina
fighting!

37:52.136 --> 37:53.871
This winery is yours too.

37:53.971 --> 37:55.573
Ours!
This is our home, Papa!

37:55.673 --> 37:57.041
I don't want to
leave Alder Bluffs,

37:57.141 --> 37:58.643
and I won't leave Alyssa!

37:58.743 --> 38:00.144
Sweety, I know
your heart is broken--

38:00.244 --> 38:01.812
They broke yours too!

38:01.912 --> 38:04.248
You put your life
into this wine, Dad.

38:04.348 --> 38:05.816
They need to see how that feels.

38:05.916 --> 38:07.652
Sophy,
I get that you're angry.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.086
I know what that feels like.

38:09.186 --> 38:12.490
I felt the same way
when my dad died.

38:12.590 --> 38:15.126
Angry that my whole life
had to change afterwards.

38:15.226 --> 38:17.962
Angry that I had to
move away from my friends

38:18.062 --> 38:21.065
and everything that I knew.

38:21.165 --> 38:24.735
I also get that it seems
like it would be satisfying

38:24.835 --> 38:26.671
to just burn
this whole place down.

38:26.771 --> 38:27.772
But I can promise you,

38:27.872 --> 38:30.474
that satisfaction
would be fleeting.

38:30.574 --> 38:31.776
And it would hurt your dad

38:31.876 --> 38:35.546
way more than it would
hurt Des and Karina.

38:35.646 --> 38:38.082
I love you, Soph.

38:38.182 --> 38:40.217
My dad couldn't say it
in so many words, but...

38:40.318 --> 38:42.186
but I can.

38:42.286 --> 38:44.655
I love you.

38:44.755 --> 38:46.924
I'm sorry.

38:47.024 --> 38:48.959
I'm so sorry, Dad.
I'm sorry.

38:59.203 --> 39:02.273
Des decided to not
press charges against Sophy.

39:02.373 --> 39:04.375
Well, he's a good guy.

39:04.475 --> 39:06.444
And a family man.

39:06.544 --> 39:08.112
They're both good men.

39:08.212 --> 39:10.448
Ronny could have retaliated
against his half-siblings,

39:10.548 --> 39:11.749
and he chose not to.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.484
Yeah.

39:13.584 --> 39:18.389
It was really nice
what you told Sophy yesterday.

39:18.489 --> 39:21.125
I wish you could have
shared that with me

39:21.225 --> 39:23.394
when you were younger.

39:23.494 --> 39:27.832
I didn't have the words then.

39:27.932 --> 39:30.201
So, wine is a whole thing, huh?

39:30.301 --> 39:35.439
Yes, you swirl it,
you sniff, and then sip!

39:37.808 --> 39:40.878
Alyssa!

39:40.978 --> 39:42.480
Oh my God,
that's amazing!

39:42.580 --> 39:43.914
Can you guess?
We're staying!

39:44.014 --> 39:45.383
You are?

39:45.483 --> 39:48.486
Yeah, well, Ronny's gonna
help run the winery with us.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.654
As a family.

39:50.755 --> 39:53.224
With our dad's traditions,
hand-picked grapes...

39:53.324 --> 39:54.425
And we're gonna leverage

39:54.525 --> 39:57.161
some of Karina's
great marketing ideas.

39:57.261 --> 39:58.996
That is wonderful.

39:59.096 --> 40:00.865
We have things
to work through, but...

40:00.965 --> 40:02.933
we think this is
what Desmond Sr.,

40:03.033 --> 40:05.703
what our father,
would have wanted.

40:05.803 --> 40:09.673
I know this is what Sophy wants.

40:09.774 --> 40:12.009
Well, to Link Estates Winery!

40:12.109 --> 40:13.411
Cheers!

40:13.511 --> 40:16.447
- Ooh!
- And to family!

40:19.150 --> 40:21.018
Can you show me around?
Of course.

40:21.118 --> 40:23.187
Let's go inside,
'cause it's kinda windy!

40:23.287 --> 40:25.489
You wanna go for a walk?

40:25.589 --> 40:28.893
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:33.798 --> 40:35.332
That was a lot!

40:35.433 --> 40:36.600
Yes, it was.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.202
- Woo!
- Yeah.

40:38.302 --> 40:40.137
I mean, I'm glad
Ronny's staying, though.

40:40.237 --> 40:41.572
Yeah.

40:41.672 --> 40:43.741
How are you feeling?
Really.

40:43.841 --> 40:45.543
Well, I...

40:45.643 --> 40:49.113
I appreciate everything
you and your mother did.

40:49.213 --> 40:53.384
Even the "exposing
explosive family secrets" part?

40:53.484 --> 40:57.321
Still processing it.
I'm hurt, angry...

40:57.421 --> 40:59.890
I-I don't know
who my dad was now.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.593
He's the same guy he always was.

41:02.693 --> 41:03.861
And for what it's worth,

41:03.961 --> 41:05.496
he was trying to do
the honourable thing,

41:05.596 --> 41:07.131
supporting Ronny and his mom.

41:07.231 --> 41:08.799
Yeah, I guess.

41:08.899 --> 41:11.001
Your dad did
a lot of good in his life.

41:11.101 --> 41:14.939
Don't discount all of it
just because of one...

41:15.039 --> 41:19.844
admittedly huge lie.

41:19.944 --> 41:22.112
You always see the best
in people, don't you?

41:22.213 --> 41:24.348
I don't think anyone has
ever said that to me before,

41:24.448 --> 41:25.516
but I'll take it.

41:25.616 --> 41:28.052
Okay.

41:30.855 --> 41:35.459
So, now that I'm no longer
a client, how about dinner?

41:35.559 --> 41:36.494
Yeah.

41:36.594 --> 41:37.828
That
would be delightful!

41:37.928 --> 41:39.964
- Hello, Mother.
- Hm!

41:40.064 --> 41:42.433
And you wouldn't have
to sneak out of the house.

41:42.533 --> 41:43.934
Mm, definitely
better than the trellis.

41:44.034 --> 41:45.202
- Mm-hm.
- I'd love that.

41:45.302 --> 41:48.172
Thank you, and I'll...
I'll see you soon, Darby.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.708
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.610
- Hm.
- Great timing, as usual.

41:52.710 --> 41:53.978
Well, you had the car keys,

41:54.078 --> 41:56.847
and Ronny gave us a case of wine
as a thank you, so...

41:56.947 --> 41:58.048
Oh!

41:58.148 --> 41:59.850
But you know what they say
about local wine.

41:59.950 --> 42:02.887
It's best sipped in the
moonlight, with a hot, new--

42:02.987 --> 42:05.356
- Stop!
- I was talking about Billy.

42:05.456 --> 42:06.524
Oh, yeah!

42:06.624 --> 42:08.559
- How did that go?
- Now you ask!

42:08.659 --> 42:10.895
- Well, we danced the tango.
- When?!

42:10.995 --> 42:13.497
I was gone for like
five minutes!

42:13.597 --> 42:16.233
Do you always dance
the tango on your first date?

42:16.333 --> 42:18.669
At least
I kept my clothes on.

42:18.769 --> 42:20.371
I walked into that one.

42:20.471 --> 42:23.173
I'm driving, by the way.
When do I get to meet him?

42:23.274 --> 42:24.141
Soon.

42:24.241 --> 42:25.876
He had to meet
a client in Reykjavik.

42:25.976 --> 42:28.812
It's kind of exciting to date
an International Man of Mystery.

42:28.913 --> 42:30.848
Oh, great.
So now you're dating a spy.
