What's the difference between
a croque madame and a croque monsieur?

00:13.764 --> 00:15.057
It's actually the exact same sandwich.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.017
The croque madame has
an egg on the top of it.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.353
So the female version
of the sandwich has an egg.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.271
That's really reductive.
- What do you want it to have?

00:21.271 --> 00:24.274
Lipstick and a push-up bra?

00:24.274 --> 00:26.944

01:39.808 --> 01:41.685
we had four different network presidents

01:41.685 --> 01:43.312
over like eight years.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.987
Yeah, that is a huge relief.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.071
So, who's the new guy?

Yeah.

what actually happened

09:47.629 --> 09:49.214
and then it just popped in my head

09:49.214 --> 09:50.757
and now I'm not panicking.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.926
It was so nice to meet you.
You are so pretty

09:52.926 --> 09:54.511
in a strong and self-confident way

09:54.511 --> 09:55.721
and I love your blazer.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.270
What? Hey.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.564
No, okay, hold on, what was that?

10:05.564 --> 10:06.607
What was what?

10:07.983 --> 10:11.069
Is there something going on
that I need to know about?

10:11.653 --> 10:13.572
Between me and Bree? No.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.366
Okay, 'cause she just came--
she didn't even knock

10:16.366 --> 10:17.868
and she just came flying in

10:17.868 --> 10:20.078
and we both know there's no way

10:20.078 --> 10:21.580
she figured out the Wordle.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.873
That one?

10:22.873 --> 10:24.499
Yeah?
Reed, they're ready for you.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.084
Oh, God, I have an interview.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.836
- It's fine, I'm fine.
- I'm just--

10:27.836 --> 10:30.714
I can't do this right now anyway,
so I'm gonna go back to your hotel.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.883
I'm gonna rest.
That's what I'm gonna do.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.219
Yeah, that's great. Just rest up, yeah.
Take a bath.

10:35.219 --> 10:36.970
The tub's big enough for two people.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.306
I'm guessing.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.142
Based on how alone I feel when I'm in it.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.477
I hear a female voice.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.561
Is Bree in there?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.522
Bree, I have your purse.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.524
Okay. I'm gonna go.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.195
Fuckin' Dennis.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.365
Right this way.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.284
Thank you, Marty.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.995
It's great to be at the wheel again.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.081
Just bring me some hits.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.083
When? This weekend?
That could definitely work.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.085
You know we love Malibu.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.712
Oh, you're in Oxnard.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.881
Oh, yeah, oh, wait.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.301
Oh, darn.
We got a wedding.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.011
Yep, well, let's do something soon.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.263
All right, gotta go.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.684
I get the top job and all of a sudden,

11:23.684 --> 11:26.311
I got more agents up my ass than
a hooker at upfronts.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.731
So, I'm in my first staff meeting

11:29.731 --> 11:33.277
this morning when I hear
"Step Right Up" is back

11:33.277 --> 11:35.070
and it's mine.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.197
And I think this is my lucky day

11:37.197 --> 11:39.992
'cause I get to reconnect
with my old friend Gordan Gelman.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.536
Okay.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.706
You must be Hannah.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.500
I've heard wonderful,
wonderful things about you.

11:48.959 --> 11:52.713
Oh, um, thank you, that's,
that's very nice of you to say.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.590
And I understand you made
some kind of horror movie.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.799
What-what was it called?

11:55.799 --> 11:56.967
Um, it's called <i>Cunt Saw</i>

11:56.967 --> 11:58.760
and a lot of people think
it's a horror movie,

11:58.760 --> 12:00.512
but it's actually not.
The title is a metaphor

12:00.512 --> 12:03.015
for the struggle that women
face in a male-dominated--

12:03.015 --> 12:04.933
Right.
Let's, let's get right down to it.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.476
What, he asked.

12:06.476 --> 12:10.314
Yeah, all right, so, uh,
just, why don't you say it?

12:10.314 --> 12:11.857
We're canceled, right?

12:11.857 --> 12:13.108
Is that what you thought?

12:13.525 --> 12:15.068
- No?
- No.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.489
I saw a cut of the new show

12:20.949 --> 12:22.659
and I think it's really great.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.120
- Oh.
- Especially compared to the original.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.998
It's hipper, it's smarter,
it's less old-timey sitcom.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.542
Hannah, I have to assume that's you

12:30.542 --> 12:33.337
because it's, it's like a different show.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.840
Um, well actually, it is more of a,

12:36.840 --> 12:38.258
it's more of a collaboration.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.384
Here's the thing.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.513
What do you think of that actress
you just added, Timberly Fox?

12:44.014 --> 12:45.516
She, she's great.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.976
We love her.
- Oh, well, then this may hurt.

12:48.519 --> 12:50.521
'Cause I'm gonna cast her as a lead
in a new series.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.523
We start shooting next week in Romania.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.859
Uh, wait, what?

12:55.859 --> 12:57.027
I'm taking your woman

12:58.153 --> 12:59.905
even though you love her.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.865
But I wanted to tell you face-to-face,

13:01.865 --> 13:03.659
'cause I think it's the right thing to do.

13:03.659 --> 13:06.995
Hold up, um--
She's huge in the next three episodes.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.748
We'd have to throw out all our scripts
and start from scratch.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.708
Well, I imagine
that'll be heartbreaking.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.753
But, you can't just
take an actress from us.

13:14.753 --> 13:15.879
We have a deal with her.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.006
No, actually, we have a deal with her.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.134
But, believe me, I take no joy in this.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.847
Speaking of no joy,
I may need to make some cuts

13:24.847 --> 13:26.807
in the promo and production budgets,

13:26.807 --> 13:28.725
which we are all hoping will not lead

13:28.725 --> 13:32.437
to the show's slow,
painful, lingering death.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.856
Hmm.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.023
Gordon, old friend.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.483
You seem pretty quiet. What do you think?

13:37.526 --> 13:40.237
- You really wanna know?
- I really do.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.074
- Well, old friend--
- Dad, Dad.

13:44.074 --> 13:48.704
I think God
doesn't give with both hands,

13:48.704 --> 13:50.414
so when he made you handsome,

13:50.414 --> 13:53.000
he figured, I can't give him brains, too,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.836
so you charm people
into thinking you're interesting

13:55.836 --> 14:00.174
and you, you bully people
into thinking you're smart,

14:00.174 --> 14:01.633
but you're not.

14:01.633 --> 14:06.263
You're not.
You're, you're a stupid, pretty man.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.764
And you know what?

14:07.764 --> 14:10.184
You wouldn't know a good show if--

14:10.184 --> 14:11.476
If what?

14:11.476 --> 14:13.729
If it slept with my wife?
- Oh, boy.

14:13.729 --> 14:14.980
Okay, there it is.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.691
Well, so you know, we were all drinking

14:17.691 --> 14:21.778
at a William Morris party
and she came on to me.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.071
Bullshit.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.157
Not bullshit.
I remember it very clearly.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.492
She leaned over
and she whispered in my ear

14:27.492 --> 14:32.331
that she wanted me
because you under performed.

14:32.748 --> 14:37.503
That was the word she used,
under performed.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.963
Let's, let's go,
we don't need this asshole.

14:44.927 --> 14:48.430
Well, that was unfortunate.

14:49.515 --> 14:51.391
Uh, yeah, yeah.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.938
For the record,
I would never allow that

14:55.938 --> 14:59.399
decide the fate of "Step Right Up"

14:59.399 --> 15:02.152
because that would be wrong.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.698

better off without your dad?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.963
Zack, the only reason I told you this

17:25.963 --> 17:28.006
was because
I needed someone to talk to.

17:36.974 --> 17:38.767
Well, I thought
our business relationship

17:38.767 --> 17:41.478
was such that you could keep
sensitive data confidential.

If it comes at the expense
of one of our colleagues,

18:28.275 --> 18:31.778
Sure, but you know what,
if, if you're leaving cans and bottles

18:31.778 --> 18:34.448

those off your hands.

Oh, sorry, I need
two jobs there, Hollywood.

18:57.513 --> 19:00.015

19:00.015 --> 19:01.975

a big financial commitment.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.061
- Why?
- No, no, no, no, wait, I've seen this.

19:04.061 --> 19:07.773
He wants to swoop in
and buy the house himself.

19:08.232 --> 19:11.193
By the way, if you don't have
a real estate agent--

19:11.193 --> 19:14.112

I don't know anything.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.939
Then fuck it,
I can't think about this anymore.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.110
There, I'm neutered.
- Yes!

19:53.110 --> 19:55.571
Yes, in your face, shithead.

19:55.571 --> 19:57.489
Two people just got a home today.

19:58.991 --> 20:00.117
Congratulations.

20:03.328 --> 20:06.206
So Reed, what's the best part
about being back on the show?

20:06.206 --> 20:07.624
Uh, well, you know, Carly,

20:07.624 --> 20:09.835
I really love being
back together with the gang,

20:09.835 --> 20:13.255
but mostly I'd say the nicest thing
this time around is that

20:13.255 --> 20:15.591
we've all settled into
our roles with maturity,

20:15.591 --> 20:18.177
you know, with, um,
seasoning, if you will.

20:18.177 --> 20:20.179
And we all are so familiar with each other

20:20.179 --> 20:21.555
that there are no surprises, so.

20:22.014 --> 20:25.976
I must say, I was surprised today
when Bree shared the happy news.

20:25.976 --> 20:26.852
Oh, what news is that?

20:27.436 --> 20:29.146
She told me that
you two are back in love.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.815
Really?

20:31.815 --> 20:33.734
And talking about having a baby.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.363
- Really?
- I broke the news on
Twitter 20 minutes ago...

20:38.363 --> 20:39.740
- Oh.
- ...and "Step Right Up" fans

20:39.740 --> 20:40.866
are already buzzing.

20:42.993 --> 20:46.121
Well, no one is buzzing more than me.

20:51.043 --> 20:54.338
So tell me what is
involved in recreating a--

20:56.006 --> 20:58.175
Okay. Hee, hee, hee!

20:59.384 --> 21:00.802
<i>It's Nora, text me.</i>

21:02.095 --> 21:03.222
You!

21:03.764 --> 21:05.390
No, no, no.
- Ooh.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.976
What the actual fuck
did you say to that reporter?

21:07.976 --> 21:10.687
Okay, okay, I was trying to warn you,
but I didn't wanna do it in front of Nora.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.315
Oh, no, that's right.
Yeah, better she finds out on Twitter.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.484
Oh, it's on Twitter?
Is it trending?

21:15.984 --> 21:18.904
Why would you say that to a reporter?

21:18.904 --> 21:22.616
Look, I didn't mean to,
but I found out on camera

21:22.616 --> 21:26.286
that Anders married his assistant
and they're having a baby.

21:26.286 --> 21:29.248
I felt like I was drowning
and I needed something to hang on to.

21:29.248 --> 21:30.499
Oh, like my neck?

21:30.499 --> 21:32.584
Nora already suspects

21:32.584 --> 21:34.545
that there's something
going on between us.

21:34.545 --> 21:37.172
She's the jealous type, huh?
That is a red flag.

21:37.172 --> 21:38.465
Red flag?

21:38.465 --> 21:41.134
You are the one that just told
the world we're having a baby.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.886
Ohh. Okay, drama queen,

21:42.886 --> 21:44.429
I said talking babies.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.639
We're not talking babies!

21:45.639 --> 21:47.224
Well, we kind of are right now, so.

21:47.224 --> 21:48.559
Hey, this isn't a fucking game.

21:48.559 --> 21:49.643
It is my life.

21:54.815 --> 21:57.025
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

21:57.734 --> 21:58.944
I am.

21:59.987 --> 22:01.446
You were the first person I thought of.

22:01.446 --> 22:03.365
Why? Are you trying
to break up me and Nora?

22:04.825 --> 22:07.119
No.
That's crazy.

22:07.119 --> 22:08.829
Is it? I, I don't understand
what's happening.

22:08.829 --> 22:11.206
Are you trying to get
back together with me?

22:11.206 --> 22:12.624
Why are you asking me that?

22:12.624 --> 22:13.876
'Cause I need to know.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.714
No.

22:18.714 --> 22:21.008
I told you, I just panicked.

22:21.008 --> 22:22.801
I don't know what's going on between us,

22:22.801 --> 22:24.720
but the fact that
you would drag me into this

22:24.720 --> 22:27.764
without any regard
for the consequences, oh God.

22:28.932 --> 22:33.478
Oh-- for 15 years,
I was sane and centered

22:33.478 --> 22:37.357
and then two months with you
and I am heading down crazy river

22:37.357 --> 22:39.234
straight toward batshit falls

22:39.234 --> 22:40.861
and I am done.

22:40.861 --> 22:42.321
Oh, my goodness.

22:42.321 --> 22:44.740
Is that Reed Sterling
and Bree Marie Jensen?

22:44.740 --> 22:47.576
I heard these two have a baby
who's about to "Step Right Up."

22:47.576 --> 22:49.703
Let's hear it for the happy couple.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.252
Why, why are you yelling?

28:52.774 --> 28:54.610
- What?
- I know you're probably with Nora,

28:54.610 --> 28:56.820
so just listen.

28:57.279 --> 28:59.573
<i>I wasn't honest with you before.</i>

29:00.282 --> 29:02.409
The reason I said
that we were still together

29:03.285 --> 29:05.787
is because I knew it would hurt Anders,

29:06.371 --> 29:09.416
because he was always jealous of you.

29:09.416 --> 29:13.587
I guess he sensed that my feelings
for you never really went away

29:14.588 --> 29:16.673
and that he would never
be the love of my life.

29:20.636 --> 29:22.888
I think that honor belongs to you, Reed.

29:33.899 --> 29:35.442
I just got engaged.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.031
Oh.

29:47.412 --> 29:49.957
- Okay.
- Hey.

29:49.957 --> 29:52.251
So just got off the phone
with Mallory and--

29:52.251 --> 29:54.920
Oh, your HR girlfriend.
How's that going, the two of you?

29:54.920 --> 29:57.214
She's not my girlfriend.
Not technically.

29:58.006 --> 30:01.009
Maybe we're both waiting for the other
to say the word, I don't know.

30:01.009 --> 30:02.636
Okay, anyway, she told me

30:02.636 --> 30:05.264
that if Griffin messes with the show

30:05.264 --> 30:07.516
due to a personal grudge,

30:07.516 --> 30:09.184
that could be grounds for us--

30:09.184 --> 30:10.561
Let, let me stop you right there.

30:10.561 --> 30:12.938
I just met with him again, problem solved.

30:14.606 --> 30:15.774
So you apologized?

30:15.774 --> 30:18.193
Uh, no, I quit.

30:19.570 --> 30:21.238
You what?

30:21.238 --> 30:22.489
I had no other choice.

30:22.489 --> 30:25.284
This guy is petty and ruthless

30:25.284 --> 30:26.785
and if I stayed, I promise you,

30:26.785 --> 30:29.079
he would find some reason to cancel us.

30:29.079 --> 30:30.706
So, we made a deal.

30:30.706 --> 30:33.041
I leave and he doesn't fuck with the show.

30:33.876 --> 30:36.128
No, no. Yes.

30:36.128 --> 30:38.547
Uh, no. I'm sorry.
You do not get to be the hero here

30:38.547 --> 30:41.049
sacrificing yourself to save us all.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.926
- Uh--
- Did you try apologizing?

30:42.926 --> 30:45.554
Oh, sweetie, I'm too old

30:45.554 --> 30:48.390
and too rich to apologize
to a guy like that.

30:48.390 --> 30:50.184
I-- that's not gonna happen.
I can't--

30:50.184 --> 30:52.603
That's not in my DNA, sorry.

30:53.687 --> 30:54.897
So you didn't even try.

30:56.315 --> 30:59.985
Instead of swallowing your pride,
you're just leaving

31:01.820 --> 31:02.779
me.

31:02.779 --> 31:05.532
I, I'm not leaving you.

31:05.532 --> 31:08.410
I'm leaving an impossible situation.

31:09.077 --> 31:11.205
Yeah, where have I heard that before?

31:11.205 --> 31:14.583
No, no, this is not
like that, come on. You--

31:15.083 --> 31:16.585
It's gonna be fine.

31:16.585 --> 31:18.879
You, you totally got this.

31:18.879 --> 31:21.840
You're doing great
and, and come on, you know,

31:21.840 --> 31:23.217
it's not like we're not
gonna see each other.

31:23.217 --> 31:24.510
We'll see each other all the time.

31:25.886 --> 31:27.804
So do me a favor
and just thank everybody

31:27.804 --> 31:29.598
for me and send my regrets.

31:29.598 --> 31:32.017
