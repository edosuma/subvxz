00:01.302 --> 00:01.435
.

00:01.469 --> 00:02.203
- You guys remember
"Candle Cove"?

00:03.537 --> 00:05.239
In 1988,
five kids went missing.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.176
- The Iron Hill Murders.
Never solved.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.178
- Look who's back
in the middle of things.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.613
- A lot of folks just like you
and your mom lost people.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.116
- How are you holding up
having him home?

00:15.149 --> 00:17.185
- It's so strange.
I barely know him.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.552
- Pay the toll.
- Shove it up your ass.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.454
- Get him, Gene!
- [screams]

00:20.488 --> 00:21.822
- It did something
to my brother.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.391
It can make people do things.

00:23.424 --> 00:24.625
- Hi, Daddy.
- What is it, Lily?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.127
- You have to go inside.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.062
- Eddie.
I did it.

00:28.096 --> 00:32.133
- Did what?
- I killed him.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.135
- Mike, I need you to come
down to the station with me.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.470
It's something
that your mom told me.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.472
- You missed the turn.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.241
Where are you taking me?

00:41.309 --> 00:44.078
[thunder rumbles]

00:53.187 --> 00:55.123
- Okay.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.459
Ahh.

01:00.694 --> 01:04.298
11 years old.

01:04.332 --> 01:07.101
Okay, make a wish.
Both of you.

01:07.135 --> 01:10.171
- Why don't you trade?
Make each other's wish?

01:10.204 --> 01:11.605
- Better do something good
for me, Eddie.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.242
- We share.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.210
Whatever you have,
I have, too.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.878
- Ready?

01:17.911 --> 01:18.879
One...

01:18.912 --> 01:21.315
- Two, three.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.385
- Yay.
- Yeah, there you got it.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.453
- Good job.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.321
Did you wish
for something good?

01:27.355 --> 01:29.623
- I did.
- Don't tell her what it was.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.425
It won't come true.

01:31.459 --> 01:35.229
- Yeah, you're not too good
at keeping secrets.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.547
[tense music]

01:53.581 --> 02:00.588

02:09.430 --> 02:12.400
[cheerful music]

02:12.433 --> 02:14.635
*

02:14.668 --> 02:17.471
- Gosh, a treasure chest.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.278
- Careful now, Percy.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.381
That box might be locked
for a reason.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.517
And once you let
bad things out,

02:29.550 --> 02:32.553
you can never put them back.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.389
- Blow away, Mr. Cloud.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.624
It's a treasure chest.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.726
Pirates love treasure.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.563
- [laughing]

02:42.596 --> 02:43.764
- Oh!

02:58.779 --> 03:00.648
- Oh!

03:00.681 --> 03:04.352
Oh, Marla, you scared me.

03:06.754 --> 03:10.458
- I-I'd like to talk to Mike.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.227
- Why would Mike be here?

03:13.261 --> 03:17.431
- Well, Gary, he, um, brought
him in just a little while ago.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.601
- No, I, uh, I haven't
seen Gary all night.

03:20.634 --> 03:25.573
- Well, if Gary
didn't bring him here,

03:25.606 --> 03:27.341
where did he take him?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.780
- Are you saying Gary
took Mike into custody?

03:34.548 --> 03:37.518
[tense music]

03:37.551 --> 03:41.855
*

03:41.889 --> 03:44.425
- Gary, I don't know
what my mother told you,

03:44.458 --> 03:47.528
but my intention here
is to help Katie and Dane and--

03:47.561 --> 03:49.763
- You remember
the old Iverson place?

03:51.465 --> 03:53.567
Jess was the listing agent.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.839
The house needed a lot of work,
but it had good bones.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.775
So we decided that we gonna
grab it for ourselves.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.380
We had all these plans
to fix it up.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.651
Never got a chance.

04:10.684 --> 04:14.488
Some rich guy from Cleveland
bought it out from under us.

04:14.522 --> 04:17.625
Paid all cash.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.461
And gutted the place.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.830
You know how these guys are.

04:22.863 --> 04:26.567
Gets bored, never finishes.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.371
So now the house
is on the market again.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.706
Jess is the listing agent.

04:35.343 --> 04:38.446
But it'll never be ours.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.681
The price is too high.

04:48.556 --> 04:52.493
- He's not answering.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.796
Went to voicemail.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.732
- Any idea where
Gary would have taken him?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.605
- What the hell
is going on?

05:17.451 --> 05:20.421
[suspenseful music]

05:20.454 --> 05:26.427
*

05:26.460 --> 05:29.497
- Um, what are we doing here?

05:31.565 --> 05:34.468
- Once the truth is out,
you got to face it.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.577
[door shuts]

05:52.786 --> 05:54.788
Sit.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.762
[bell rings]

06:16.209 --> 06:18.479
- Bologna.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.913
- Bologna.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.750
[sizzling]

06:22.783 --> 06:25.919
- In Italy they
call it "Mortadella."

06:27.555 --> 06:29.557
- Mortadella.

06:37.665 --> 06:38.966
- Jacob.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.673
- Bless us, O Lord,
and these, Thy gifts,

06:45.706 --> 06:48.509
which we are about
to receive from Thy bounty.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.544
Through Christ our Lord--

06:50.578 --> 06:53.747
- [groaning]

07:04.825 --> 07:05.993
Blessed be God,

07:06.026 --> 07:08.562
the Father of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

07:08.596 --> 07:10.531
the Father of all mercies,

07:10.564 --> 07:13.701
who comforteth us
in all of our tribulation.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.604
- Our bodies--

07:16.637 --> 07:18.238
even mine,
believe it or not--

07:18.271 --> 07:23.076
have 11 systems.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.947
Digestive...

07:26.980 --> 07:29.950

07:29.983 --> 07:33.053

07:40.794 --> 07:42.730
- [panting]

07:42.763 --> 07:44.765
- [laughs]

07:44.798 --> 07:48.068
You shouldn't have
opened that box, shark bait.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.837
But now you let me out,

07:49.870 --> 07:52.573
and I'll have your hide!

07:52.606 --> 07:54.842
[chuckles]

07:54.875 --> 07:56.810
Jawbone's the name and...

07:56.844 --> 08:00.514
[voice distorting]
skinning's my game.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.518
- Immune,

08:04.552 --> 08:05.753
nervous...

08:05.786 --> 08:07.788
[laughter on phone]

08:12.893 --> 08:15.563
Endocrine,

08:15.596 --> 08:17.097

[tense music]

08:20.133 --> 08:22.035
*

08:22.069 --> 08:23.537
- Gary.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.076
What's going on right now?

08:35.649 --> 08:37.651
[car doors closing]

08:52.165 --> 08:53.834
- Hi, Mike.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.936
- Daphne.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.106
Tim.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.174
What are we doing here?

09:01.208 --> 09:04.144
- I don't like my phone
ringing at the break of dawn,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.580
but Gary here says,
"Wake up.

09:06.614 --> 09:10.117
"Get on out here
because it looks like

09:10.150 --> 09:13.186
"all that Friday night talk
over the years,

09:13.220 --> 09:16.924
"you know, hey,
you think that, uh,

09:16.957 --> 09:21.061
"maybe given certain details,

09:21.094 --> 09:23.797
"the Painter family
knew more about the murders

09:23.831 --> 09:25.633
"than they're letting on?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.868
"Looks like they were true
because Mike Painter

09:27.901 --> 09:30.938
just confessed
to one of them."

09:30.971 --> 09:34.775
Well, Mike, we're gonna
have a little chat

09:34.808 --> 09:38.946
that's long overdue
because, I'll be honest,

09:38.979 --> 09:42.783
I always thought your family
had something to do with it.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.619
Daphne: We just want
to talk, Mike.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.922
- Okay.
I'm happy to talk.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.724
Just untie me.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.093
- You can talk like that.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.134
- Just tell the truth, Mike.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.877
- Okay, this is the truth.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.246
28 years ago, somebody made
a TV show called "Candle Cove"

10:13.280 --> 10:16.717
and broadcast it
on a dead channel.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.418
It influenced the kids
who saw it,

10:18.451 --> 10:20.854
and before it was over
five of those kids were dead.

10:20.888 --> 10:24.658
- You killed
your brother Eddie.

10:24.692 --> 10:27.127
You killed your brother, Mike,

10:27.160 --> 10:28.829
then you left Iron Hill.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.131
The murders stopped.
The disappearances stopped.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.768
Then 28 years later,
you come back,

10:34.802 --> 10:37.805
everything starts again,
right away.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.139
- You're looking in
the right direction,

10:39.172 --> 10:40.941
but you're making
the wrong connection.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.744
- So are you telling me
that my kids wouldn't be

10:43.777 --> 10:48.048
in the hospital
if you hadn't come back?

10:48.081 --> 10:49.850
- I want to show you something.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.691
Jacob Booth.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.160
Mrs. Booth's only son.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.734
Sadie Williams.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.702
My cousin.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.738
She taught me how to kiss.

11:14.942 --> 11:18.045
Carl Cutter.
The cut-up.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.089
- My brother Gene.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.300
- Tim.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.008
- That's what we're
doing here, Mike.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.944
Me and Tim are not cops
right now.

11:50.978 --> 11:54.047
We're all just people
who lost people,

11:54.081 --> 11:56.183
and before you go
into the system,

11:56.216 --> 12:01.121
we want to know exactly what
you did and why you did it.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.301
- Where's your brother,
Fainter?

12:14.334 --> 12:16.069
- Where's yours?

12:16.103 --> 12:17.871
- Go home, dickless wonder.

12:17.905 --> 12:21.775
Want me to break
your fingers, too?

12:21.809 --> 12:23.310
- Want to see something cool?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.912
Me and Eddie found it.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.847
Figured you would know
what to do.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.783
- Bullshit.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.820
- It's worth money,
but okay.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.355
- Where you going, Mike?
- The Crow's Nest.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.925
[tense music]

12:41.995 --> 12:44.131
- Gary, are you home?"

12:44.164 --> 12:45.332
[door shuts]

12:45.365 --> 12:48.068
Are you here?
Gary?

12:54.007 --> 12:55.408
- I'm gonna drive
over to Tim's.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.144
- Gary?

12:57.177 --> 13:00.914
- Why don't you two stay here
in case Gary comes back?

13:07.955 --> 13:11.391
Tim: I still have dreams
about my brother.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.929
And the look
on my parents' faces

13:15.963 --> 13:18.431
when we heard
that he was dead.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.868
- I stopped eating.

13:20.901 --> 13:24.037
Got so thin I almost died.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.940
- That's the worst thing
about losing someone, Mike.

13:26.974 --> 13:30.110
It's not knowing
how or why.

13:30.143 --> 13:34.214
- They wouldn't even tell me
what really happened to Gene,

13:34.247 --> 13:35.883
but I found out, Mike.

13:35.916 --> 13:39.953
Sure, he was a bully,
and we were redneck idiots,

13:39.987 --> 13:43.290
but he looked out for me.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.093
He didn't deserve to die

13:46.126 --> 13:50.330
with his neck broke
and his teeth gone.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.832
- I just dream
about "Candle Cove."

13:56.303 --> 13:59.072
- That's because it's
still there,

13:59.106 --> 14:01.108
all the time,

14:01.141 --> 14:03.243
working on us.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.012
What about you, Gary?
Tim?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.379
You guys dream about it?

14:06.413 --> 14:08.081
Because I do.

14:08.115 --> 14:11.351
For 30 years,
I've been dreaming about it.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.121
Always there,
behind everything.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.456
We all saw it.
It did something to us.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.292
- "Candle Cove" was on TV
the same time as the murders.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.428
That's the only connection.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.096
- I'm telling you, you're wrong.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.466
- The bottom line is,
you killed my brother.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.369
You killed Eddie,
and you killed Sadie.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.670
- No, I didn't.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.139
- You killed Jacob.
You killed Carl.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.107
And now you're back
in town here.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.275
Mike, what are you gonna do?
- We shouldn't have done this.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.977
- You gonna kill
some more children?

14:37.010 --> 14:38.345
- Come on, Mike, it felt pretty
good to tell you mom

14:38.378 --> 14:39.346
about Eddie, right?
- You know what?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.081
Now that I think about it,

14:41.114 --> 14:43.383
I think that we've had
just about enough talk.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.285
Maybe it's time for
some justice instead of talk!

14:45.318 --> 14:48.221
- No, no, no, no, Tim!
- I didn't have a choice!

15:00.033 --> 15:02.035
- How are those
fingers feeling?

15:06.039 --> 15:08.976
- You like "Candle Cove," Gene?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.211
- I don't watch
that retard show.

15:11.244 --> 15:15.182
- Don't lie.
I know you do.

15:15.215 --> 15:18.485
You can't lie
to the Skin-Taker.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.221
- The what?

15:28.528 --> 15:30.397
- Stop.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.069
- [laughing]

15:43.410 --> 15:45.312
- What are you doing to him?

15:45.345 --> 15:48.481
- Showing him stuff
in his head.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.051
He can't do anything now.

15:51.084 --> 15:54.087
- [laughing]

16:02.095 --> 16:04.097
- [spits]

16:05.498 --> 16:07.967
[laughs]

16:09.436 --> 16:11.071
- Here, boy.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.074
[suspenseful music]

16:14.107 --> 16:21.114

16:28.055 --> 16:31.058
- [laughs]

16:34.394 --> 16:36.396
- Pay the toll.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.449
Now you can go
to Candle Cove.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.318
Walk the plank.

16:58.351 --> 17:03.390
*

17:03.423 --> 17:07.094
- Hey, wait!

17:07.127 --> 17:10.130
Hey, wait!

17:10.163 --> 17:11.498
- [grunt]

17:20.340 --> 17:23.343
- Eddie killed them.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.179
"Candle Cove" got into him.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.348
It changed him.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.318
Because he was vulnerable.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.486
Because you
made him vulnerable.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.322
Tim. Gary.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.556
You hurt him.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.659
And I had to stop him.

17:45.365 --> 17:45.665
.

17:45.698 --> 17:46.099
- Something's up.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.338
I can't reach Gary or Tim,
and this thing with--

17:51.371 --> 17:53.740
- Help! Help!
- Hang on.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.876
- Stop!
Help.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.280
These kids are
hurting someone!

18:00.313 --> 18:03.283
[suspenseful music]

18:03.316 --> 18:05.752
*

18:05.785 --> 18:07.787
- Hey!

18:10.257 --> 18:12.292
Hey, drop those knives!

18:15.628 --> 18:17.897
Oh, my God.
[laughs]

18:17.930 --> 18:21.801
Oh, oh, you guys
scared the shit out of me.

18:21.834 --> 18:26.706
Where'd you get that thing from,
science class?

18:26.739 --> 18:30.310
Alex, Chloe,
what's going on?

18:30.343 --> 18:33.580
Why are you, uh--hey!

18:33.613 --> 18:35.715
H-hey, get back here!

18:40.853 --> 18:42.855
What?

18:54.267 --> 18:57.837
- Marla.

18:57.870 --> 19:01.708
Why did Gary arrest Mike?

19:01.741 --> 19:05.178
- Mike...

19:05.212 --> 19:07.614
did something unforgivable.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.284
- You mean
you can't forgive him?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.759
The last couple of years,

19:19.792 --> 19:23.730
Mike and I started emailing.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.833
Texts.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.969
Like that.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.873
At first,
it was once in a while.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.777
Then more.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.782
And then every day.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.688
It became...

19:48.721 --> 19:51.791
important to me.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.893
- Did Gary know?

19:53.926 --> 19:57.664
- I didn't think so.

19:57.697 --> 20:01.401
Then Mike went quiet on me.

20:01.434 --> 20:05.372
Like he dropped off
the face of the Earth.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.408
So I deleted everything.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.444
Every last email.

20:13.980 --> 20:17.384
It's been hard this year.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.786
Gary had his hopes set
on this--

20:19.819 --> 20:23.790
this property
in the countryside.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.493
And when that fell apart,

20:26.526 --> 20:29.696
he just got so...

20:44.010 --> 20:45.545
It's not here.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.714
- What?

20:51.551 --> 20:53.920
- I know where Gary took Mike.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.560
Gary: TV shows don't
kill people, Mike.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.430
- Gary, think about
your daughter.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.366
She saw the show and one day
later she tries to kill Dane--

21:06.399 --> 21:08.835
- No, she talked to you.
- No. No. No.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.504
You got it--no.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.473
Daphne.

21:13.506 --> 21:14.941
You feel it.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.576
You know it's true,
don't you?

21:16.609 --> 21:19.011
- Mike.
- It's okay, because I do, too.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.047
Just tell them.
Just tell them.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.582
What do you dream about?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.917
- Mike.
- Just tell them.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.586
- Cut the therapy shit.
- He's right.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.321
We knew it was
connected somehow.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.923
- No. No, we don't know
anything like that at all.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.960
- Gary, we have to find
whoever made that show.

21:33.993 --> 21:37.864
I saw it that day
at the Crow's Nest.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.834
Listen, Daphne,
in the dreams,

21:41.868 --> 21:43.503
what do you see?

21:43.536 --> 21:45.572
A face that's just a skull?

21:45.605 --> 21:48.074
The white eyes?
You remember?

21:48.107 --> 21:51.578
- In the show.
They called it Jawbone.

21:51.611 --> 21:52.879
But in the dreams...

21:52.912 --> 21:54.080
- Okay. In the dreams?

21:54.113 --> 21:56.015
- It has a different name.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.584
- Well, I saw it that day.

21:57.617 --> 22:00.052
A person dressed as Jawbone.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.455
And whoever this person is,
he's still out there right now.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.625
- Okay, even if there is
some person out there, Mike--

22:05.658 --> 22:08.395
- What the hell is wrong
with you, huh?

22:08.428 --> 22:12.465
- Tim--
- This all points back to him.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.401
This is not about
a goddamn puppet show.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.869
It was just a show
that aired on TV then.

22:18.538 --> 22:23.075
His mom sends him away
and the murders stop.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.577
He killed those kids.

22:24.611 --> 22:25.578
- I didn't.
- Tim.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.380
- He killed Gene,

22:27.414 --> 22:30.417
and maybe, just maybe,
his mother helped cover it up.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.918
- Okay, look,
even if he's lying,

22:31.951 --> 22:33.820
we need to look at this,
we need to look in the woods

22:33.853 --> 22:36.556
and just see what's going on
with what he's talking about.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.393
What are you doing, Tim?

22:40.427 --> 22:43.896
No, no, no.
Tim, what are you doing?

22:43.930 --> 22:45.031
This is going
a little too far, Tim.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.399
We're done here.
- Tim, Tim.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.967
- All right, we're done.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.536
I'm gonna take him in.
Give him a trial by jury.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.671
- He can have a trial
by jury right now.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.039
- Okay, Tim.
- Fu-- talking.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.507
I'm done talking!
- Tim! Tim!

22:54.541 --> 22:56.042
This is not what
we're here to do.

22:56.075 --> 22:59.045
- Get out of the way, Gary.
- Now, listen to me.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.480
You're gonna put that away.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.848
We're gonna forget this
ever happened.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.182
That's an order.
- 911, I want to--

23:03.215 --> 23:05.151
- Daphne, hang that up.
Now. Hang that up.

23:05.184 --> 23:08.688
- I'm not moving, Tim.
- Tim, I didn't do anything.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.990
- Get out of the way, Gary.
- I'm not moving, Tim.

23:11.023 --> 23:14.427
You put that gun down.
That's an order.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.096
- I'm sorry, Sheriff.

23:17.129 --> 23:19.866
I'm just like Mike.
I don't have a choice.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.900
- Yeah, you do.

23:20.933 --> 23:21.901
Don't!

23:40.687 --> 23:43.823
The first time you draw
is on me.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.758
- We're gonna talk him
to the station.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.026
It was an accident.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.728
- An accident?

23:48.761 --> 23:49.929
- That's right.
He tried to get your gun.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.064
- Gary?
- What, Daphne?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.100
- Your wife's here.

24:11.851 --> 24:15.755

- Shut up!

24:18.725 --> 24:21.728
That's enough.
[straining]

24:21.761 --> 24:23.630
- Jess, you can't
be here right now.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.231
- Where's Mike?
- You got to leave.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.833
You got to leave.
You got to leave.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.768
- Is Mike inside?
- Let me handle this.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.803

the box cutter.

Are you in there?

24:46.886 --> 24:50.923

from there right now!

24:50.957 --> 24:52.859
Marla, get down from there.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.994
- Just let me inside.
- Mike!

24:55.027 --> 24:56.663
- Oh, Gary--
- Jess.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.130
Jess!

24:58.164 --> 25:00.667
Jess, he--

25:00.700 --> 25:02.134
Jess, he killed his brother.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.872
We needed to find out
what happened.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.708
- Have you lost your mind?

25:12.745 --> 25:15.247
- Tim!

Jessica: Oh, my God.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.131
Oh, shit.

It'll be okay.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.861
I need you to tell me
what happened out there

28:14.894 --> 28:16.462
and why.

28:18.798 --> 28:21.801
Marla, maybe you should
leave us alone.

12-year-old Carl Cutter
has been reported missing.

28:35.948 --> 28:38.350
He was last seen yesterday
around 3:30--

28:42.955 --> 28:46.425
- What happened to Carl?

28:46.458 --> 28:48.861
- He's in Candle Cove.

28:51.964 --> 28:55.334
- You're saying
he was...influenced

28:55.367 --> 28:59.238
by this TV show?

28:59.271 --> 29:02.809
A show no one
can prove existed?

29:02.842 --> 29:05.845
- Yeah.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.380
- And this other person you saw,

29:08.414 --> 29:12.451
this adult accomplice,

29:12.484 --> 29:15.922
you have no idea
who they were?

29:18.124 --> 29:22.094
- It's back.

Kids will watch it,

29:24.430 --> 29:27.800
just like we did.

And when they do,

29:31.003 --> 29:34.874
they may start
to behave in ways that--

What?

29:39.011 --> 29:41.447
What do you know?

29:44.516 --> 29:46.886
Did something happen?

29:52.524 --> 29:56.428
- All I know...

29:56.462 --> 29:58.865
is you confessed
to killing Eddie,

29:58.898 --> 30:00.466
and as acting sheriff,
that is a fact that I--

30:00.499 --> 30:02.534
- No, he did not.

30:02.568 --> 30:06.405
He didn't confess.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.908
Gary misunderstood.

30:08.941 --> 30:12.912
- Gary misunderstood?

30:12.945 --> 30:16.082
You just said Eddie killed
the other four kids,

30:16.115 --> 30:18.084
and then you killed him.

30:18.117 --> 30:22.321
- Eddie killed
the other four kids.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.590
And then he disappeared.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.029
- So that's your story now?

30:30.062 --> 30:32.331
- It's the truth.

33:57.169 --> 34:00.172
You're not exactly
gonna go on the lam

34:00.206 --> 34:04.643
and start a new life
in Mexico.

34:04.676 --> 34:08.180
You have to turn yourself in.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.150
- I know.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.652
I will.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.687
- Attagirl.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.327
You want something to drink?

34:48.320 --> 34:51.790
- Cocoa?

34:51.823 --> 34:53.725
Is all that for us?

34:53.759 --> 34:55.694
- No.

34:55.727 --> 34:58.730
I'll get you
something stronger.

35:22.921 --> 35:26.124
- [choking]

35:46.545 --> 35:46.712
.

35:46.745 --> 35:47.179
[cheerful music]

35:49.681 --> 35:54.853
*

35:54.886 --> 35:57.856
[suspenseful music]

35:57.889 --> 36:05.231
*

36:24.883 --> 36:27.553
- Where did you leave the body?

38:10.021 --> 38:12.991
[cheerful music]

38:13.024 --> 38:20.366
*

38:39.818 --> 38:46.825

39:26.832 --> 39:29.801
[tense music]

39:29.835 --> 39:36.842

40:52.050 --> 40:52.217
.

40:52.250 --> 40:52.684
[tense music]

40:55.186 --> 41:02.193
*

41:05.531 --> 41:08.099
- [screams]

41:08.133 --> 41:10.001
[groaning]

41:10.035 --> 41:12.003
- What is it?
What happened?

41:12.037 --> 41:15.240
- It was a nightmare.
Oh, God.

41:15.273 --> 41:16.975
Oh, God.
- You're okay.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.209
You're okay.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.712
- Yeah, I'm fine now.

41:20.746 --> 41:23.181
Oh, it was horrible.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.216
Oh.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.556
What is it?

41:30.589 --> 41:33.158
- I don't know.

41:35.260 --> 41:38.530
Lily.
It's my daughter.

41:38.564 --> 41:40.632
*

41:40.666 --> 41:43.301
Lily! Lily!

41:43.334 --> 41:46.572
Lily! Lily!

41:46.605 --> 41:49.641
What--what are you--
What are you doing here?

41:49.675 --> 41:51.242
How did you?
Baby?

41:51.276 --> 41:53.144
Baby, look at me.
What are you--

41:53.178 --> 41:55.647
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

41:55.681 --> 41:56.748
Lily.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.650
Are you--Lily?

41:58.684 --> 42:00.051
Are you okay?

42:00.085 --> 42:01.787
How did you get here?

42:01.820 --> 42:03.589
Baby, look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

42:03.622 --> 42:06.725
How did you get here?
How did you get here?

42:06.758 --> 42:10.662
