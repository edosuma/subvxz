<i>This program is rated G</i>

00:04.233 --> 00:07.300

general audiences.</i>

00:10.433 --> 00:13.066
<i>This(bright music)ted G</i>

00:49.266 --> 00:51.133
I'm trying to surpass
the Burj Khalifa

00:51.266 --> 00:53.200
as world's tallest structure.

00:53.333 --> 00:58.166
The bride wanted seven tears
for her lucky prime number.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.633
Maybe we will get
lucky this weekend

00:59.767 --> 01:01.700
and meet a couple
millionaires of our own.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.100
I feel like I'm going to be
piping champagne buttercream

01:06.233 --> 01:07.867
in my sleep tonight.

01:08.000 --> 01:08.867
Well, you're optimistic.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.200
What sleep?

01:10.333 --> 01:11.767
Hmm.

01:11.900 --> 01:16.033
Is this side an eighth of an
inch shorter than this side?

01:17.500 --> 01:20.100
Okay, is this because you are
catering the society wedding

01:20.233 --> 01:21.767
of the decade or because
it's Jess's wedding?

01:21.900 --> 01:22.767
Both.

01:22.900 --> 01:23.767
And no particular order.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.200
Admit it.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.533
You just want Justin
to eat her words

01:26.667 --> 01:28.700
about your little business.

01:28.834 --> 01:29.700
Is that so wrong?

01:29.834 --> 01:31.633
Did I hear my name?

01:33.834 --> 01:37.767
Oh, Goldy your
cake, it's stunning.

01:37.900 --> 01:41.200
Well, it's not done,
but thank you so much.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.033
What are you
talking about, mother?

01:43.166 --> 01:45.867
Those are macadamia
nuts on my wedding cake.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.934
I told Goldy a thousand times,

01:49.066 --> 01:50.867
Sterling's allergic
to tree nuts.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.600
And is that a Juliet rose I see?

01:54.734 --> 01:56.033
You know that Romeo
and Juliet's love

01:56.166 --> 01:59.367
went from epic to tragic
almost overnight, right?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.934
Why don't just break
a mirror on my cake?

02:02.066 --> 02:03.266
Jess, Jess...

02:04.300 --> 02:06.767
- Well--
- Well,

02:06.900 --> 02:14.266
we can replace the Juliet
rose with a, um, um...

02:14.400 --> 02:17.333
A Paeonia lactiflora.

02:17.467 --> 02:19.834
A peony, those stand for
love and good fortune.

02:19.967 --> 02:21.600
Love and good fortune.

02:21.734 --> 02:22.767
Good.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.333
And also they
aren't macadamia nuts.

02:25.467 --> 02:28.433
They are pure Madagascar
white chocolate.

02:28.567 --> 02:31.433
There is not a nut in sight.

02:31.567 --> 02:34.934
Except for the
one in front of us.

02:35.066 --> 02:36.033
Mm.

02:37.967 --> 02:40.000
Still, get rid of them.

02:40.133 --> 02:41.500
Pearls of any sort

02:41.633 --> 02:44.333
represent future tears and
heartache in a marriage.

02:44.467 --> 02:46.100
Do I have to
micromanage everything?

02:46.233 --> 02:47.567
Let's go, mother.

02:49.633 --> 02:50.600
Thank you.

02:52.300 --> 02:55.934
Well, as expected, she
is the ultimate bridezilla.

02:56.066 --> 02:57.500
And she is also our client.

02:57.633 --> 02:59.266
And nothing is gonna stop
us from putting on the most

02:59.400 --> 03:00.834
memorable rehearsal dinner,

03:00.967 --> 03:03.500
and wedding reception
Elk Park has ever seen,

03:03.633 --> 03:05.667
even if it kills us.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.333
Now, let's go find some peonies.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.333
Hey.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.734
Is that him, is that the guy?

03:29.867 --> 03:31.734
Mom, boundaries.

03:31.867 --> 03:33.000
He's cute.

03:33.133 --> 03:36.233
Mom, that is so (indistinct)!

03:36.367 --> 03:38.934
My baby has our first crush.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.100
Hunter.

03:51.633 --> 03:57.166
What's up man?

03:57.300 --> 04:01.800
Sterling Bridgewater
finally came back to Elk Park.

04:01.934 --> 04:03.400
Golden Berry.

04:03.533 --> 04:05.400
Oh, I haven't
been called that a forever.

04:05.533 --> 04:06.633
You haven't aged a day.

04:06.767 --> 04:08.400
Oh, and you're
still the charmer.

04:08.533 --> 04:10.066
Apparently not
charming enough.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.300
Let's just say not
everyone has given me

04:11.433 --> 04:12.734
as warm a welcome.

04:12.867 --> 04:15.133
Well, you and Hunter
are gonna be family now,

04:15.266 --> 04:16.800
so you're just gonna
have to play nice.

04:16.934 --> 04:19.066
I always play nice.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.400
Even if my future
brother-in-law doesn't.

04:21.533 --> 04:23.633
That is Elk Park for you.

04:28.367 --> 04:30.734
Yes more, more ladies, more.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.900
Big smiles, ladies.

04:33.033 --> 04:34.166
All together.

04:35.367 --> 04:36.300
She does light up
a room, doesn't she?

04:36.433 --> 04:37.467
I mean...

04:37.600 --> 04:41.900
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

04:42.033 --> 04:42.900
Ladies.

04:48.266 --> 04:52.233
Pinch me, am I dreaming or
is this actually happening?

04:52.367 --> 04:53.734
Ah!

04:53.867 --> 04:56.467
For a delicate flower, you
are stronger than you look.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.800
It's all the espresso.

04:58.934 --> 05:00.700
Goldy and Marla, you guys.

05:00.834 --> 05:01.967
It's been forever.

05:02.100 --> 05:02.967
Katie!

05:04.600 --> 05:06.533
I thought that
was you out there.

05:06.667 --> 05:07.967
So you're a bridesmaid

05:08.100 --> 05:09.333
Maid of honor, actually.

05:09.467 --> 05:10.433
Wow.

05:11.633 --> 05:12.700
I guess I didn't realize that
you and Jess were friends

05:12.834 --> 05:14.033
in high school.

05:14.166 --> 05:15.567
Yeah, we kept in
touch even though

05:15.700 --> 05:17.967
we went to different state
colleges, but we're BFFs now.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.300
Crazy, right?

05:19.433 --> 05:20.300
Well,
you look great.

05:20.433 --> 05:21.300
How are you?

05:21.433 --> 05:22.367
Never better.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.800
- Here you go, babes.
- Oh, thanks hon.

05:23.934 --> 05:26.133
Goldy, Marla, this
is my boyfriend Ray,

05:26.266 --> 05:28.133
and Sterling's best man.

05:28.266 --> 05:29.800
These are my old
high school friends.

05:29.934 --> 05:31.633
Minus the old part.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.200
So did you guys
meet in San Francisco?

05:35.333 --> 05:36.800
Born and raised.

05:36.934 --> 05:39.166
I was classmates from Sterling
in college and Katie had just

05:39.300 --> 05:40.200
broken poor Sterling's heart.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.200
Oh, please.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.533
You love that you got the girl.

05:42.667 --> 05:43.800
Guilty.

05:43.934 --> 05:45.533
I'm a lucky man.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.200
And is that when
Jess and Sterling

05:48.333 --> 05:49.533
started seeing each other?

05:49.667 --> 05:51.300
No, that was way after that.

05:51.433 --> 05:53.200
They reconnected at one of our
house parties, right babes?

05:53.333 --> 05:55.700
Yeah, yeah, just after
she and Tom got divorced.

05:55.834 --> 05:58.367
She'd been living in
San Francisco for a
few years by then

05:58.500 --> 06:00.700
and we were hanging out.

06:00.834 --> 06:02.200
Ray and I invited her over.

06:02.333 --> 06:06.033
She and Sterling
reconnected and here we are.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.533
Hey Ray.

06:07.667 --> 06:11.533
Sorry ladies, there's a
30 year single malt calling.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.767
Nice to meet you.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.600
Nice to meet you.

06:14.734 --> 06:16.266
Hey, let's all grab lunch
after the wedding to catch up.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.700
That would be great.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.934
- Yeah!
- Have fun!

06:20.066 --> 06:21.934
Ah, what a cute couple.

06:22.066 --> 06:24.867
Don't you hate being
single at these things?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.533
You'll always be my plus one.

06:28.734 --> 06:30.433
Man,
these are so good.

06:30.567 --> 06:32.934
You're liking
those, aren't you?

06:33.066 --> 06:34.533
I'm loving the parsley chips.

06:34.667 --> 06:35.533
She's perfect.

06:35.667 --> 06:36.767
Oh, thank you.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.767
Thank you so much, it's
such a beautiful spread.

06:38.900 --> 06:39.867
Oh, you're welcome.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.867
Don't you think, Laurence?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.100
Oh, yes, yes.

06:42.233 --> 06:43.600
Nothing too good
for your daughter.

06:43.734 --> 06:46.100
Loving these beef sliders.

06:46.233 --> 06:48.100
Actually, they're bison.

06:48.233 --> 06:49.100
Bison.

06:49.233 --> 06:51.433
Per the bride's request.

06:51.567 --> 06:54.533
Of course they are. Well, I
better grab a couple of more.

06:54.667 --> 06:55.533
Get my money's worth.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.033
There you go.

06:57.166 --> 07:01.166
He's
accepted Jess as his own.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.934
She looks so happy, doesn't she?

07:05.567 --> 07:07.600
With her band of besties.

07:10.133 --> 07:11.533
Well, I think it's really nice

07:11.667 --> 07:15.934
that so many people have found
love a second time around.

07:16.066 --> 07:17.834
Can I get a scotch, neat?

07:17.967 --> 07:19.500
Chester, taking a break from

07:19.633 --> 07:21.433
all that wheeling and dealing.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.934
Work can wait.

07:23.066 --> 07:24.633
Tonight is all
about sporting Jess.

07:24.767 --> 07:25.767
Right.

07:27.734 --> 07:31.600
Doubt it all you want, Jess
and I make solid partners.

07:31.734 --> 07:33.433
We've got big goals
for Whitetail.

07:33.567 --> 07:35.934
I don't doubt
Jess's sincerity.

07:36.066 --> 07:37.600
I doubt yours.

07:37.734 --> 07:39.100
While she's distracted
planning this wedding,

07:39.233 --> 07:42.934
you're quietly trying to
poach her high end clients.

07:43.066 --> 07:44.433
What you talking about?

07:44.567 --> 07:46.433
I'm onto you.

07:46.567 --> 07:50.100
And as soon as this wedding's
over, Jess will be too.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.567
Man, this is busing.

08:09.033 --> 08:11.834
Oh, I
gotta talk to Tommy.

08:11.967 --> 08:12.967
Hey Katie.

08:14.033 --> 08:14.900
Well, hello.

08:15.033 --> 08:16.400
Hello, hello.

08:16.533 --> 08:17.400
So good to see you.

08:17.533 --> 08:18.400
You too. You too.

08:18.533 --> 08:19.433
- Have a seat.
- You look great.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.333
Thank you.

08:21.467 --> 08:22.667
I really appreciate
you coming, Tommy.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.967
Well, I
appreciate the invite.

08:27.867 --> 08:30.467
Take a picture mom,
it'll last longer.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.600
What?

08:33.033 --> 08:34.834
No, see, I was, I was,
you see back there?

08:34.967 --> 08:37.667
I was just trying to make
sure that the waiter was,

08:37.800 --> 08:40.233
you know, doing the thing.

08:40.367 --> 08:41.233
Uh-huh.

08:41.367 --> 08:42.400
Anyway.

08:42.533 --> 08:44.333
Um, I'm headed to
Charlotte's house.

08:44.467 --> 08:45.400
Her mom's here.

08:45.533 --> 08:46.400
Oh, okay.

08:46.533 --> 08:47.500
I love you.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.166
Text me when you
get there, okay?

08:50.300 --> 08:51.500
Tell Charlotte's mom.
I said thank you.

08:51.633 --> 08:52.500
Okay.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.900
Oh, shoot, man!

09:01.867 --> 09:03.734
That's expensive.

09:03.867 --> 09:06.567
If looks could kill.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.600
It's a far cry
from city hall, huh?

09:07.734 --> 09:08.633
Oh, come on.

09:08.767 --> 09:09.633
City hall worked.

09:09.767 --> 09:10.633
Worked?

09:10.767 --> 09:12.400
No, it didn't, we're divorced.

09:12.533 --> 09:14.900
Anyway, water under
the bridge now.

09:15.033 --> 09:17.400
This time I'm doing it right.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.400
I hope he makes you happy.

09:19.533 --> 09:22.700
I hope the same
for you too one day.

09:25.767 --> 09:26.900
Congratulations.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.000
Excuse me.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.567
Am I loud in here?

09:33.700 --> 09:36.567
It's my kitchen.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.233
You can be here anywhere I am.

09:38.367 --> 09:39.800
Well, you did it again.

09:39.934 --> 09:41.066
Oh.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.233
And to put a smile
on Jess's face.

09:44.367 --> 09:45.400
That's not easy.

09:45.533 --> 09:49.300
She
wasn't that bad.

09:49.433 --> 09:52.133
You know, it was um, fun.

09:52.266 --> 09:53.633
You're a terrible liar.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.233
I know.

09:55.367 --> 09:56.567
This is why I'm the chef and
you're the detective, right?

09:56.700 --> 09:58.233
Oh, I'm off duty tonight.

09:58.367 --> 09:59.633
Is a cop ever off duty?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.133
Stick around, you'll find out.

10:01.266 --> 10:04.133
Mm, but can you
handle the heat?

10:04.266 --> 10:05.900
Try one.

10:06.033 --> 10:10.900
- The heat?
- Yeah.

10:11.033 --> 10:16.233
- Child's play.
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.000
See now this is fun.

10:26.900 --> 10:27.800
Hey.

10:27.934 --> 10:28.900
Is that him?

10:29.033 --> 10:31.400
The famous detective?

10:31.533 --> 10:34.233
You're drunk and
soaked in champagne.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.967
I'm so celebrating.

10:36.100 --> 10:40.800
I'm getting married to the most
gorgeous bride in Elk Park.

10:40.934 --> 10:44.233
Yeah, you are.

10:44.367 --> 10:46.800
Do they look like
a couple to you?

10:46.934 --> 10:48.333
Does it matter?

10:49.367 --> 10:50.567
Look at you now, honey.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.066
I'd say you upgraded.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.233
Ooh.

10:55.367 --> 10:56.233
Oh, easy.

10:56.367 --> 10:57.233
What?

10:57.367 --> 10:58.233
You're drunk.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.400
Take a walk, get some coffee.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.900
- You know I'm--
- Thank you.

11:10.266 --> 11:11.467
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.533
You leaving?

11:12.667 --> 11:13.800
- I had fun.
- You did?

11:13.934 --> 11:15.767
I did have fun, yep.

11:17.333 --> 11:22.467
So my fiance is upset
at me for some reason.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.867
Katie, how about you
and I grab a drink

11:28.000 --> 11:30.300
fr old times sake, huh?

11:30.433 --> 11:32.867
Maybe you and I could
give it another go.

11:34.000 --> 11:34.867
Ray!

11:35.000 --> 11:36.367
I'm just, I'm kidding.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.967
Lighten up.
- Oh!

11:38.100 --> 11:40.467
Lighten up, is this
a party or a funeral?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.867
Leave my girlfriend out of it.

11:43.000 --> 11:43.867
I'm gonna need
you to handle that.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.967
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:46.100 --> 11:46.967
I was just joking.

11:47.100 --> 11:47.967
Come on, man.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.367
I'm getting married tomorrow.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.367
Yeah, well, some
things aren't funny, man.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.467
You know what's not funny?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.033
You ruined my watch.

11:55.166 --> 11:57.467
You don't see me complaining
about that, okay.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.467
Oh yeah, as you keep
telling us it's a Rolex.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.867
Well, what's the little
champagne gonna do?

12:01.000 --> 12:01.867
You know what?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.200
I think you've had enough.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.433
No, I think it's
past your bedtime.

12:04.567 --> 12:05.700
Okay, well, maybe
if you hadn't spilled

12:05.834 --> 12:07.266
all my dad's champagne
on your watch,

12:07.400 --> 12:08.433
you'd still have a
functioning Rolex.

12:08.567 --> 12:09.500
What's your problem?

12:09.633 --> 12:10.500
With you?

12:10.633 --> 12:11.867
I don't know.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.033
You're entitled, spoiled,
narcissistic, can't dress.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.433
Oh, big words
from a little man.

12:16.567 --> 12:17.934
You know what?

12:18.066 --> 12:19.533
Maybe you should sell some
more of your daddy's flawed

12:19.667 --> 12:21.467
software to the town,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.600
that he can buy you a
new Rolex, huh, big guy?

12:24.734 --> 12:27.200
- Watch your mouth.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.633
Knock it off.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.333
Think of Jess.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.100
Don't tell me
to think of Jess.

12:39.667 --> 12:40.700
Relax, all right?

12:43.900 --> 12:44.867
Hey, hey.

12:46.567 --> 12:49.200
Go home and sleep it off.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.333
You don't wanna do this.

13:02.567 --> 13:05.667
Ugh, let's go
make some coffee.

13:05.800 --> 13:10.667
500 unlucky white chocolate
pearls need to be refashioned.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.000
Hey, come with me.

13:12.133 --> 13:13.100
I'll get you some ice.

13:13.233 --> 13:14.166
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.500
Should have gone home earlier.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.100
- Gold.
- Hmm?

13:25.233 --> 13:27.000
Have you seen Sterling?

13:27.133 --> 13:29.767
He's gone and not
answering his phone.

13:56.567 --> 13:58.433
Hey, Quinn.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.667
I need you to stay back.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.834
Detective?

14:03.967 --> 14:05.000
Where's Jess?

14:05.133 --> 14:06.233
We can't find her,

14:06.367 --> 14:08.233
but I notified next of
kin, Sterling's parents.

14:08.367 --> 14:09.834
Send a squad car to her hotel.

14:09.967 --> 14:12.233
We need to find her right now,
Mason. I'll call Jess's mom.

14:12.367 --> 14:13.233
Okay.

14:13.367 --> 14:14.533
Goldy and Marla are upstairs.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.667
Okay.

14:22.467 --> 14:23.400
Hey ladies.

14:23.533 --> 14:24.467
Hey.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
Okay?

14:27.800 --> 14:28.667
You know where Jess is?

14:28.800 --> 14:29.767
No.

14:31.667 --> 14:32.567
I hope she's okay.

14:32.700 --> 14:33.834
Detective?

14:33.967 --> 14:35.000
- Yes?
- Yes.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.667
Uh, sorry boss.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.900
What you got?

14:40.033 --> 14:41.166
Nothing conclusive,

14:41.300 --> 14:42.500
but looks like
blunt force trauma

14:42.633 --> 14:44.166
to his right temporal region.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.834
I won't know more
until I do the autopsy.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.367
TOD?

14:47.500 --> 14:50.500
I'd estimate time of death
within the last few hours.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.166
What's this?

14:52.300 --> 14:54.734
Some sort of
rash, forensic swab.

14:54.867 --> 14:57.166
Strange that it's
only on his right hand.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.400
Yeah.

14:58.533 --> 14:59.567
Did you find a cell phone?

14:59.700 --> 15:02.066
They're searching
the perimeter.

15:09.266 --> 15:10.900
Impact blood spatter.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.900
What you thinking, boss?

15:13.033 --> 15:18.734
I don't know, detective,
what do you think I'm thinking?

15:18.867 --> 15:20.300
You want me to...

15:20.433 --> 15:24.400
Um, medium velocity
forward spatter.

15:24.533 --> 15:26.567
If the victim died from
blunt force trauma,

15:26.700 --> 15:28.233
this may be our murder weapon.

15:28.367 --> 15:29.367
Very good.

15:30.433 --> 15:31.900
Yes!

15:32.033 --> 15:34.467
If it was foul play, don't
jump to any conclusions.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.467
You still need to get
statements, DNA swabs,

15:35.600 --> 15:37.066
and fingerprints.

15:38.100 --> 15:43.233
Okay.

15:43.367 --> 15:46.233
Ray, this is Detective Kildea.

15:46.367 --> 15:47.967
Mason.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.400
Ah!

15:51.100 --> 15:52.633
You okay?

15:52.767 --> 15:53.967
Yeah.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.734
Well, can I have a seat, Ray?

15:55.867 --> 15:56.867
Sure.

16:00.934 --> 16:05.633
So when was the last
time you saw Sterling?

16:05.767 --> 16:08.467
This morning, around 9:00.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.467
He stepped outside
for a few minutes,

16:11.600 --> 16:13.800
but he never came back.

16:13.934 --> 16:15.867
Did he say he was
meeting with anybody?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.467
No, we were ready
to go to the church.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.800
I tried texting and calling,
but he never responded.

16:21.934 --> 16:23.867
Have you seen or
heard from Jess?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.800
No, not since last night.

16:26.934 --> 16:29.033
I was in the kitchen all
morning prepping hors d'oeuvres.

16:29.166 --> 16:31.800
Nothing was off on my end.

16:31.934 --> 16:33.867
Well, from my end,
something was off.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.533
I passed through the lobby and
that's when I found Sterling

16:37.667 --> 16:38.700
and we checked for a pulse.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.800
We tried CPR,
but nothing worked.

16:43.900 --> 16:44.800
What time was that?

16:44.934 --> 16:45.800
10:30.

16:45.934 --> 16:46.867
Were the doors locked?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.133
Yes.

16:48.266 --> 16:49.800
No, Goldy had
already opened them.

16:49.934 --> 16:51.633
Deliveries were
coming in and out.

16:51.767 --> 16:53.300
I'll need a list
of those vendors.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.967
What was Sterling's mood
like the last time you saw him?

16:56.100 --> 16:57.700
Combative.

16:57.834 --> 17:00.200
He was in a great mood.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.867
He wasn't in a great mood.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.100
How'd you get that black eye?

17:04.233 --> 17:05.533
I tripped and fell.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.000
Hit my face right on a doorknob.

17:08.133 --> 17:09.133
Uh-huh.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.033
Did Sterling have any enemies?

17:12.166 --> 17:13.266
Everyone loved Sterling.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.533
Everyone hated Sterling.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.867
I liked Sterling.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.767
Anne didn't like Sterling.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.200
Call if you remember
anything else.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.433
Is it just me or
are these people

17:22.567 --> 17:24.767
contradicting each other?

17:24.900 --> 17:27.033
Eyewitness testimonies are
like slogging through mud,

17:27.166 --> 17:30.500
but somewhere in
between lies the truth.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.700
Boss, they found
Sterling's cell

17:33.834 --> 17:35.367
a hundred yards from here.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.934
Jessamyn purse, key
fob and car keys

17:38.066 --> 17:39.533
were at her hotel room
with signs of a struggle.

17:41.834 --> 17:43.700
No cell phone, no Jess.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.934
Tell them to seal
off Jess's hotel room.

17:48.066 --> 17:49.367
Nobody goes in.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.934
Hey.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.500
Thank goodness you're here.

18:30.633 --> 18:31.834
Jess is missing,
what is going on?

18:31.967 --> 18:33.266
We're gonna find her

18:33.400 --> 18:36.600
Is, it true, is
Sterling really dead?

18:39.066 --> 18:42.100
I'm afraid so, yes.

18:42.233 --> 18:45.433
Who would wanna do this to
Sterling and, and Jessamyn?

18:45.567 --> 18:46.700
I, I don't...

18:47.734 --> 18:49.433
When did you last see Jess?

18:49.567 --> 18:50.934
This, this morning.

18:51.066 --> 18:53.166
We were all taking photos
and, and drinking mimosas.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.100
She said she needed a
moment and wanted us

18:56.233 --> 18:59.767
all out of her hotel room,
so we, we gave her space.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.900
You know how she
gets sometimes.

19:02.033 --> 19:03.166
What time is that?

19:03.300 --> 19:05.400
I don't know,
eight-ish, maybe.

19:05.533 --> 19:06.667
I mean, I started
getting worried

19:06.800 --> 19:07.734
because when it
was time to leave,

19:07.867 --> 19:09.166
she wasn't answering her calls.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.900
Yeah, Ann stayed here
and I, I drove around

19:11.033 --> 19:13.000
looking for her.
- Okay.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.834
Where's Laurence.

19:15.967 --> 19:19.000
He went home earlier,
he wasn't feeling well.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.066
Is there some place
Jessamyn could have gone?

19:21.200 --> 19:22.200
She wasn't getting
cold feet, was she?

19:22.333 --> 19:23.333
No.

19:24.367 --> 19:26.233
She loves Sterling.

19:26.367 --> 19:30.400
I mean, Jess has
been known to take off.

19:30.533 --> 19:32.000
Remember Bali?

19:32.133 --> 19:33.266
I mean, she went there for two
weeks without telling anyone.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.333
- No, no, no.
- Just because.

19:34.467 --> 19:36.500
This is different.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.600
This is her wedding day.

19:40.133 --> 19:42.567
Laurence...

19:42.700 --> 19:43.834
What about Jess, any news?

19:43.967 --> 19:45.033
No.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.900
We have to treat Jess
as a missing person.

19:47.033 --> 19:50.000
Oh!

19:57.867 --> 19:59.400
What is it?

19:59.533 --> 20:01.333
Find something?

20:01.467 --> 20:04.333
How do they fold the
towel to look like a swan?

20:04.467 --> 20:05.333
Doesn't make sense.

20:05.467 --> 20:06.767
Mason, focus.

20:09.133 --> 20:13.266
Sorry, crime scene.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.500
Money and credit cards intact.

20:19.633 --> 20:21.500
It's definitely not a robbery.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.667
Boss, do you think
it's possible...

20:23.800 --> 20:27.066
I'm not saying your ex is a
cold-blooded killer or anything,

20:27.200 --> 20:30.066
but could Chessman have
done it and skipped town?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.166
Not a chance.

20:32.300 --> 20:36.166
She'd never have left
that Chanel purse behind.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.333
There's only
one candle holder.

20:40.467 --> 20:42.066
Its pair's missing.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.333
Oh, let's keep her eyes
peeled for the other one.

20:43.467 --> 20:46.900
What else is off in
Miss Cole's room?

20:47.033 --> 20:49.333
Oh, it's messy for a lady.

20:52.133 --> 20:53.233
You don't know Jessamyn.

20:53.367 --> 20:56.066
Aside from that, her
clothes are all here,

20:56.200 --> 20:58.667
but there's no suitcase.

21:06.367 --> 21:07.734
Hi. Welcome.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.467
How you doing?

21:09.600 --> 21:10.967
I don't, I don't get it.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.800
Is this a floral shop
or a coffee shop?

21:13.934 --> 21:14.900
It's both.

21:15.934 --> 21:16.967
Both.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.100
Do you sell tires
and mosquitoes too?

21:18.233 --> 21:19.133
No.

21:19.266 --> 21:20.300
But you can find an abundance

21:20.433 --> 21:23.033
of sass, spunk and shell shock.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.900
Sorry, it's been a
long and trying day.

21:28.033 --> 21:29.400
What can I get you?

21:29.533 --> 21:32.033
Just a black coffee, thanks.

21:33.367 --> 21:36.800
You uh, sure you don't
wanna try one of our specials?

21:36.934 --> 21:40.233
It's all a bit uh,
exotic for my taste.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.734
I mean, the grilled
cheese sounds okay,

21:42.867 --> 21:45.734
but why you gotta mess it
up with truffled cremes,

21:45.867 --> 21:47.133
whatever those are.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.734
Raminis.

21:48.867 --> 21:51.800
They're mushrooms and they
are full of antioxidants.

21:51.934 --> 21:54.567
It's a pass on, just
the coffee's good.

21:54.700 --> 21:55.834
Okay. Enjoy.

21:56.867 --> 21:57.800
Oh.

21:57.934 --> 22:00.233
Oh, you're good. Keep it.

22:01.433 --> 22:02.800
Oh, Marla, it's
your lucky day.

22:02.934 --> 22:06.467
You can finally get those
Gucci heels you wanted.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.333
It looks taller than
I thought it would be.

22:13.467 --> 22:14.467
Yeah.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.300
Let me give you a boost.

22:17.433 --> 22:18.700
Why can't I give you a boost?

22:18.834 --> 22:20.300
I've been working out.

22:20.433 --> 22:23.633
You think I'm going in there?

22:23.767 --> 22:24.633
No.

22:24.767 --> 22:26.133
Don't argue, Mason. Come on.

22:26.266 --> 22:27.967
Get on my knee.
- Fine.

22:28.100 --> 22:29.700
Is that okay?
- Yeah.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.133
Knee on my shoulder.

22:31.266 --> 22:32.533
Yeah. There we go.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.133
What'd you have her breakfast?

22:34.266 --> 22:35.967
Oh, my mom made me an omelet,

22:36.100 --> 22:37.200
but she ran outta hash browns.

22:37.333 --> 22:40.367
It's a rhetorical
question, Mason.

22:43.767 --> 22:45.367
It's
disgusting in here.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.133
Just stay focused.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.467
Dig.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.300
Oh wait, I see something.

22:51.433 --> 22:52.400
I got it.

22:54.100 --> 22:59.300
And look, there's
blood and hair.

22:59.433 --> 23:03.266
Try to curb your enthusiasm
that my ex might be dead.

23:12.567 --> 23:15.700
I hate to say it,
but he had it coming.

23:15.834 --> 23:17.867
Sterling waltzes into town

23:18.000 --> 23:19.433
and the butter doesn't
melt in his mouth.

23:19.567 --> 23:21.934
Catering swanky dinners with
ice sculptures and fountains

23:22.066 --> 23:25.200
and my dad has to
foot the bill again.

23:25.333 --> 23:26.700
Trust me, I am not losing sleep

23:26.834 --> 23:28.767
over either of those
two freeloaders.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.266
Hi.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.934
I gotta go.

23:32.066 --> 23:32.967
Hi.

23:33.100 --> 23:34.033
I'm sorry, is this,
is this a bad time?

23:34.166 --> 23:35.367
No, no, not at all.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.533
Okay.

23:36.667 --> 23:37.600
Thank you so much for
bringing the wedding cake.

23:37.734 --> 23:38.934
Yes, of course.

23:39.066 --> 23:41.367
Would've been a shame
for it to go to waste.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.934
Well, the Hoops for Teens
Foundation is grateful.

23:44.066 --> 23:45.533
We've had to shut down
the programs for two weeks

23:45.667 --> 23:46.700
while the gym was
being repaired.

23:46.834 --> 23:47.767
But the kids are back tonight.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.266
They're gonna enjoy the meal.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.767
You're really
making a difference.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.433
Trying to.

24:05.567 --> 24:07.934
I'll talk to Quinn
about the autopsy report.

24:08.066 --> 24:09.433
You look into the hotel footage.

24:09.567 --> 24:11.934
But first bring the candle
hold of the forensics.

24:12.066 --> 24:13.100
Even with the rush order,
could take a couple days.

24:13.233 --> 24:14.300
Well, it's still
backlogged, huh?

24:14.433 --> 24:15.400
Schultz.

24:17.467 --> 24:19.600
Track.

24:19.734 --> 24:21.100
What do you doing here?

24:21.233 --> 24:22.667
Nice to see you too.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.700
I've been transferred.

24:26.066 --> 24:29.433
Temporary assignment.

24:29.567 --> 24:31.166
Mason, this is
Detective Dave Track

24:31.300 --> 24:32.433
from Third Precinct.

24:32.567 --> 24:35.100
Track, this is
Detective Mason Kildea.

24:35.233 --> 24:36.500
Look at us, three
seasoned detectives

24:36.633 --> 24:37.934
all in the same room.

24:38.066 --> 24:40.433
Yeah, I'd say two
seasoned and one bland

24:40.567 --> 24:42.767
but I'll let you geniuses
figure out which one's which.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.934
Yeah, Tom's the best.

24:45.066 --> 24:45.934
Taught me everything I know.

24:46.066 --> 24:47.934
Ah, sorry to hear that.

24:48.066 --> 24:50.433
Tom "Buy the books" Schultz.

24:50.567 --> 24:54.266
It's better than Dave
"Bend the Rules" Track.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.834
Why are you here?

24:55.967 --> 24:59.834
Well, it seems that
I'm in and you're out.

24:59.967 --> 25:01.400
You're officially
on desk duty, Tom.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.834
So I'm gonna need the case
files for Coil and Bridgewater.

25:04.967 --> 25:06.066
What?

25:06.200 --> 25:08.166
The missing bride
and dead groom.

25:08.300 --> 25:11.333
Yeah, I know who Coil
and Bridgewater are.

25:11.467 --> 25:12.734
Why am I off their cases?

25:12.867 --> 25:15.166
Conflict of interest.

25:15.300 --> 25:18.500
I mean, your missing ex-wife
plus your association

25:18.633 --> 25:20.166
with the deceased.

25:21.633 --> 25:22.834
There's no way
I'm compromised.

25:22.967 --> 25:24.166
Sheriff says otherwise.

25:24.300 --> 25:25.266
Sheriff?

25:28.300 --> 25:31.734
I bet you couldn't wait to
come in here and tell me this.

25:31.867 --> 25:33.500
It's always the high
profile cases with you, huh?

25:33.633 --> 25:35.433
Beats traffic duty.

25:37.867 --> 25:39.734
Mason, give track
the case files.

25:39.867 --> 25:41.767
Bring him up to speed.

25:42.967 --> 25:46.066
Oh, honey, I'm so
glad softball went well.

25:47.467 --> 25:48.600
Your backpack?

25:49.867 --> 25:53.166
I don't know, but I
can check the car.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.433
Okay, hold on.

25:55.533 --> 25:57.734
Let me see here.

25:57.867 --> 26:01.400
Oh, yeah, it is right here.

26:01.533 --> 26:04.233
Do you want me to
leave it with dad?

26:04.367 --> 26:05.233
Okay.

26:05.367 --> 26:06.300
I'll drop it off at X-ray.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.900
The hotel fob sees Jessamyn
entering her room at 10:40 AM.

26:10.033 --> 26:11.567
Is there security footage?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.233
Mostly at the front with
a couple of blind spots

26:13.367 --> 26:14.567
at the side exits.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.967
So we never actually see
Jess coming or going.

26:18.100 --> 26:20.633
She could have left on
her own or been abducted.

26:22.033 --> 26:25.066
We also got an
anonymous tip, alibi.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.900
Anonymous, huh?

26:29.033 --> 26:32.967
Yeah, it
was, it was anonymous.

27:17.166 --> 27:19.600
ester.

27:19.734 --> 27:21.100
Sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

27:21.233 --> 27:23.433
I saw you in x-ray, but you
were walking away so fast.

27:23.567 --> 27:27.433
Yeah, basements and
hospitals aren't my favorite.

27:27.567 --> 27:30.700
What are
you doing in x-ray?

27:30.834 --> 27:32.200
Is it about the bruise?

27:32.333 --> 27:34.533
My ego is more
bruised than this eye,

27:34.667 --> 27:36.700
but I got the all clear.
It's not a concussion, so.

27:36.834 --> 27:38.767
Well, that's good.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.300
What did happen?

27:41.834 --> 27:46.433
Just a heated basketball game.

27:46.567 --> 27:48.934
It serves me right for trying
to show up a bunch of teens.

27:49.066 --> 27:51.700
Mm, the morning
of the wedding.

27:51.834 --> 27:53.367
That's, that's brave.

27:53.500 --> 27:56.200
It was a, it
was an early game.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.767
I coach underserved
kids, basketball.

27:58.900 --> 28:00.100
I didn't know that.

28:00.233 --> 28:02.500
Yeah, Hoops for Teens.

28:02.633 --> 28:04.100
Jessamyn signed me up.

28:04.233 --> 28:05.934
She said it would be a
good image for our brand,

28:06.066 --> 28:07.200
but it's fun.

28:09.233 --> 28:10.500
I, I could have
sworn Hunter said

28:10.633 --> 28:13.166
that the program was
shut down for two weeks.

28:13.300 --> 28:16.667
Hm.

28:19.133 --> 28:20.533
Hey, what's up?

28:22.633 --> 28:26.100
I just ran into Chester and
you need to recheck his alibi.

28:26.233 --> 28:28.600
I think he's lying about
how he got that eye.

28:28.734 --> 28:30.500
Well, I wish I could.

28:30.633 --> 28:31.767
I'm off the case.

28:31.900 --> 28:32.767
What?

28:32.900 --> 28:34.934
Conflict of interest.

28:35.066 --> 28:36.100
I'm pushing paper now.

28:36.233 --> 28:37.834
Then, who's running
the case, Mason?

28:37.967 --> 28:39.333
No, no.

28:39.467 --> 28:44.000
They brought in an outside
detective, this guy, Dave Track.

28:44.133 --> 28:45.934
You say his name
like you know him.

28:46.066 --> 28:47.133
There's history there.

28:47.266 --> 28:49.433
He's done some shady
things to solve crimes.

28:49.567 --> 28:51.433
Why would they bring
someone like that in?

28:51.567 --> 28:53.934
It was
out of my control.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.100
I'm sorry.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.834
Look, whoever killed Sterling

28:57.967 --> 29:00.567
is also responsible for
Jess's disappearance.

29:00.700 --> 29:03.233
The first 48 hours are crucial.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.233
Okay. So what can I do?

29:05.367 --> 29:06.667
How can I help?

29:08.867 --> 29:09.834
Can you break
into Quinn's office

29:09.967 --> 29:11.834
and steal the autopsy report?

29:16.200 --> 29:18.667
What?

29:18.800 --> 29:21.667
No, no, I was kidding.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.233
- Listen--
- You can't do that.

29:23.367 --> 29:25.734
I know you have to say what
you have to say, but like we,

29:25.867 --> 29:27.000
I got it, I got you.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.133
- You can't--
- I hear you.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.166
If you hear, don't
worry about it.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.333
It's gonna be fine.

29:46.967 --> 29:47.834
Hey Mason.

29:47.967 --> 29:48.867
Hey Goldy.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Hi.

29:50.133 --> 29:51.834
Are those
Snickerdoodle muffins?

29:51.967 --> 29:53.567
Those are like my favorite.

29:53.700 --> 29:54.667
Really?

29:54.800 --> 29:56.166
I didn't know that.

29:56.300 --> 29:57.734
Well, I was bringing 'em
to the precinct, but here,

29:57.867 --> 29:59.166
help yourself.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.233
If you don't mind.

30:00.367 --> 30:03.400
Yeah!

30:03.533 --> 30:05.600
Oh, these are so good.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.834
Aw, thank you.

30:08.967 --> 30:11.333
You must be so busy
with both cases.

30:11.467 --> 30:12.533
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.834
But I can't really
talk about it, you know?

30:14.967 --> 30:15.934
Of course.

30:17.133 --> 30:18.734
I just can't stop
thinking about Sterling

30:18.867 --> 30:22.567
and, and what happened
and, and just the pain

30:22.700 --> 30:24.233
that he must have been.

30:24.367 --> 30:27.500
I mean, he had blunt
force trauma to the head,

30:27.633 --> 30:29.667
but Quinn found
champagne in his lungs.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.066
Drowning is not as
painful as you think.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.567
Sure the champagne burns a bit,

30:32.700 --> 30:35.000
but then Sterling probably
drifted off to sleep.

30:35.133 --> 30:37.166
So you know, if it helps. I
hear it's a peaceful way to go.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.567
Mm, so cause of
death was drowning.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.000
Wait, what's in these
Snickerdoodle muffins?

30:46.133 --> 30:47.567
Truth serum?

30:47.700 --> 30:49.033
Gotta go.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.166
Oh, Mason.

30:52.467 --> 30:55.567
Oh, thanks.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.166
Bye Mason.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.333
Bye, Goldy.

31:11.433 --> 31:14.734
Here you go.

31:14.867 --> 31:17.233
CCTV cameras around town
showed no sign of Jess,

31:17.367 --> 31:20.734
but the forensics came
back on the candle holder.

31:20.867 --> 31:22.567
It's a match to Jessamyn DNA.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.066
The thing is,

31:24.200 --> 31:25.233
there are multiple prints
from the wedding party,

31:25.367 --> 31:26.266
plus a few partials,

31:26.400 --> 31:27.400
but they're too smeared to ID.

31:27.533 --> 31:29.300
No hits in CODIS.

31:29.433 --> 31:30.467
So whoever ditched
the candle there

31:30.600 --> 31:32.734
is likely our murderer.

31:32.867 --> 31:36.467
They're either very
sloppy or brilliant.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.066
With all the prints,

31:38.200 --> 31:40.800
we would be just spinning
our wheels going nowhere.

31:40.934 --> 31:42.333
And they know it.

31:42.467 --> 31:45.233
Whose idea was it to search the
dumpsters outside the hotel?

31:45.367 --> 31:46.734
Tom's, but--

31:46.867 --> 31:48.133
It's also Tom's DNA on
the victim's shoe, right?

31:48.266 --> 31:49.300
Yeah. But that--

31:49.433 --> 31:50.533
And guess who's
the beneficiary

31:50.667 --> 31:51.600
of Jessamyn life
insurance policy?

31:54.033 --> 31:56.066
I hate to say it,

31:56.200 --> 31:59.734
looks like we have a
new person of interest.

32:05.266 --> 32:06.200
No, exactly.

32:06.333 --> 32:07.467
When does that happen?

32:07.600 --> 32:09.033
Hi, can I help you
ladies with anything?

32:09.166 --> 32:10.033
Just looking for now, thanks.

32:10.166 --> 32:11.033
Okay.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.367
Yeah honestly, so weird.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.867
I know, the lab
results were so random,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.867
but I saw Quinn emptying
his stomach contents myself.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.367
Newly dead on his wedding day.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.867
Poor guy.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.300
He had a swollen tongue,
contact dermatitis on his hand,

32:23.433 --> 32:25.033
but no food in his stomach.

32:25.166 --> 32:26.533
It's plain weird.

32:26.667 --> 32:27.967
Hey, how about this?

32:28.100 --> 32:29.700
Your mom loves lilies.

32:29.834 --> 32:30.967
Do this one.

32:32.100 --> 32:36.633
And I had to.

32:36.767 --> 32:38.133
Does it ever stop?

32:38.266 --> 32:41.633
No, no.

32:41.767 --> 32:44.800
Well, thank you
for feeding me.

32:44.934 --> 32:46.133
You know, you didn't have to.

32:46.266 --> 32:48.300
Have you met me?

32:48.433 --> 32:53.467
You know your food's good,
but your company's even better.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.233
It goes both ways.

32:58.767 --> 33:01.033
How are you holding up?

33:01.166 --> 33:05.600
I mean, I know you and Jess
aren't together anymore,

33:05.734 --> 33:07.367
but still this has to be hard.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.767
I might not be in
love with Jess still,

33:08.900 --> 33:10.333
but I just don't want
anything bad to happen to her.

33:10.467 --> 33:11.367
You know?

33:11.500 --> 33:13.867
Of course not, no one does.

33:16.333 --> 33:22.367
I feel stuck now
that I'm desked.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.533
I feel lost without
my murder board.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.233
What?

33:32.367 --> 33:33.367
What?

33:34.834 --> 33:36.533
Not again.

33:36.667 --> 33:37.567
Goldy.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.033
Okay, listen, don't be mad.

33:39.166 --> 33:42.467
All right?

33:51.900 --> 33:54.433
I, you know, printed out
pictures of the bridal party

33:54.567 --> 33:56.934
and used Marla's leftover
flowers, and then they threw

33:57.066 --> 33:58.533
the seating tread out.

33:58.667 --> 34:01.934
So I took that and, well,
those were just pretty, and I,

34:02.066 --> 34:04.533
you know, made a murder board.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.433
Yeah.

34:08.567 --> 34:09.500
Well, it's certainly
the prettiest murder board

34:09.633 --> 34:11.166
I've ever seen.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.266
Thank you.

34:13.734 --> 34:15.433
You're not gonna
lecture me, are you?

34:15.567 --> 34:19.000
I think it's
downright brilliant.

34:19.133 --> 34:20.900
Well, in that case.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.500
Okay.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.266
Blunt force trauma.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.266
Cause of death drowning.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.433
Wait, are you...

34:37.567 --> 34:39.000
Are you just guessing?

34:39.133 --> 34:41.667
It's uh, it's a little
more than a hunch.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.433
Allergic reaction,
that's a question mark.

34:44.567 --> 34:46.500
How did you get your
hands on the autopsy report?

34:46.633 --> 34:48.433
Nothing illegal.

34:48.567 --> 34:50.667
Stomach was empty.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.934
Goldy, you're something else.

34:53.066 --> 34:55.166
Is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

34:55.300 --> 34:57.934
It's definitely a good thing.

35:00.667 --> 35:03.333
Okay, so Hunter was
saying something about

35:03.467 --> 35:05.000
selling bad software.

35:05.133 --> 35:06.166
You know anything about that?

35:06.300 --> 35:07.567
Oh yeah, well,

35:07.700 --> 35:10.667
when Sterling's family
moved here from New York,

35:10.800 --> 35:14.000
his dad convinced a lot of
people to fund a startup

35:14.133 --> 35:16.834
whose software was
supposed to be fail safe.

35:16.967 --> 35:18.667
Well, they didn't
read the fine print

35:18.800 --> 35:21.567
and he wanted it that
way because in the end,

35:21.700 --> 35:23.667
his bad software caused, well,

35:23.800 --> 35:25.333
pretty much everybody
to lose their money.

35:25.467 --> 35:27.567
The only people that made
money was Sterling's family,

35:27.700 --> 35:28.734
who then skipped town.

35:28.867 --> 35:30.500
Wait, that was years ago.

35:30.633 --> 35:31.867
Sterling was just a teenager.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.667
It was his father that
scammed them, not Sterling.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.734
It's Elk Park,
it's a small town.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.900
I mean, people
remember these things.

35:39.033 --> 35:42.400
Yeah, revenge is a
timeless motive for murder.

35:42.533 --> 35:44.000
I wonder which
families were affected?

35:44.133 --> 35:46.000
Good question.

35:46.133 --> 35:47.667
One second.
- Yeah.

35:49.133 --> 35:50.166
Hi, ma'am.

35:50.300 --> 35:51.834
I'm detective Track.

35:51.967 --> 35:53.166
Sorry to intrude.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.066
Hi Goldy, Marla said
Tom would be here.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.834
She did. Did she?

35:59.533 --> 36:00.734
Mason.

36:00.867 --> 36:01.967
Track, what's up?

36:02.100 --> 36:04.900
Tom, in light of new evidence,

36:05.033 --> 36:07.066
need to hand in your badge
and gun and come with us.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.066
My badge and my...

36:09.200 --> 36:10.300
What new evidence,
what do you mean?

36:10.433 --> 36:11.900
Yeah, what evidence?

36:12.033 --> 36:14.567
And also, you are clearly
making a mistake here.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.400
Furthermore, I don't like how
you're going around town--

36:17.533 --> 36:19.767
Goldy, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

36:19.900 --> 36:20.867
I'm coming.

36:25.367 --> 36:27.734
Hey, go to City Hall.

36:27.867 --> 36:29.967
Search land registry
records for foreclosures

36:30.100 --> 36:31.300
around the time of the scam.

36:31.433 --> 36:32.400
Okay?

36:33.934 --> 36:35.133
Stay safe.

36:35.266 --> 36:36.300
Let's go, Schultz.

36:36.433 --> 36:38.233
Yeah, I'm coming.

36:38.367 --> 36:39.800
Sorry, boss.

36:47.033 --> 36:49.834
ightly t)

37:08.934 --> 37:13.734
Piece of cake, Golden Berry.

37:18.767 --> 37:22.633
All right, maybe
not a piece of cake.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.834
Okay.

37:55.700 --> 37:56.667
Yes.

38:04.100 --> 38:07.567
No.

38:20.333 --> 38:25.467
I can't, can't, can't, can't.

38:56.600 --> 39:00.967
Ann lost her house.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.600
The evidence points to you.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.133
Motive, opportunity, intent,

39:09.567 --> 39:14.533
confess, and maybe you'll
get leniency on sentencing.

39:18.667 --> 39:19.533
Jess called you in the morning.

39:19.667 --> 39:21.100
She disappeared at 10:03.

39:21.233 --> 39:22.867
Why?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.700
I told you.

39:24.834 --> 39:26.367
She left the voicemail,

39:26.500 --> 39:28.200
I called her back and
she didn't answer.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.433
Is it normal for a
bride to call her ex

39:29.567 --> 39:30.767
the morning of her wedding?

39:30.900 --> 39:33.367
Nothing about Jess is normal.

39:33.500 --> 39:36.033
What's your angle, Tom?

39:36.166 --> 39:38.433
Kill Sterling, with Jess gone,
collect her life insurance?

39:38.567 --> 39:40.367
Or is it that she's waiting
for you and that this was your

39:40.500 --> 39:41.600
plan with her all along?

39:41.734 --> 39:43.867
That's your theory?

39:44.000 --> 39:44.967
It's absurd.

39:46.066 --> 39:50.266
Mason, you still
looking for her?

39:50.400 --> 39:54.100
Okay, we're gonna
play this my way.

39:55.734 --> 39:57.700
I guess the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree, huh?

39:57.834 --> 39:58.800
Who knows?

40:00.066 --> 40:04.767
Maybe you and your old
man will be cellmates.

40:04.900 --> 40:07.533
It's been what, 25 years?

40:07.667 --> 40:09.667
24, but who's counting?

40:09.800 --> 40:10.700
Where's Jessamyn?

40:10.834 --> 40:12.700
Sterling cut my hand.

40:14.066 --> 40:15.266
So yeah, there'd be
blood transfer on my shoe

40:15.400 --> 40:18.100
as well as the champagne glass.

40:18.233 --> 40:20.200
As for the life
insurance policy,

40:20.333 --> 40:23.033
Jess obviously forgot to
change the beneficiary.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.867
You know, the DA hasn't
filed charges yet,

40:26.000 --> 40:29.333
which means your case
has too many holes.

40:30.667 --> 40:37.033
So unless you arrest me,
can't keep me here any longer.

40:37.166 --> 40:38.700
So I'm leaving.

40:47.500 --> 40:52.600
Don't leave town.

40:52.734 --> 40:54.266
It wasn't right.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.767
Turning off an audio
recorder during an interview.

40:56.900 --> 40:58.767
And there you get fired
if you play by the rules.

40:58.900 --> 41:01.934
Evidence gathered deceitfully
is inadmissible in court.

41:02.066 --> 41:03.767
God, wake up.

41:03.900 --> 41:06.600
Judging by that deer
caught in headlights look,

41:06.734 --> 41:08.266
you didn't even know Tom's
dad was in the slammer.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.600
That's just, it's
just my normal look.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.600
I'm just saying
maybe you don't really

41:14.734 --> 41:17.600
know your mentor that well.

41:17.734 --> 41:19.333
I'm gonna need you to tail him.

41:25.734 --> 41:26.834
Room service.

41:26.967 --> 41:29.667
Goldy,
what a nice surprise.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.767
Ah, I have a question.

41:33.233 --> 41:35.333
Would you think less of me
as a mother if I had you

41:35.467 --> 41:39.166
surgically attach this
to our daughter's back?

41:39.300 --> 41:41.166
She gets her absent
mindedness from me.

41:41.300 --> 41:44.266
I'm sorry I muddled
the gene pool.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.500
Are those eclairs?

41:47.567 --> 41:48.767
Okay. What do you need?

41:48.900 --> 41:50.433
Who said I needed anything?

41:50.567 --> 41:51.600
Goldy, we have
known each other

41:51.734 --> 41:54.100
for a very, very long time.

41:54.233 --> 41:56.533
I love-hate that about us.

41:57.734 --> 41:58.934
Tom got suspended.

41:59.066 --> 42:00.834
What, what happened?

42:00.967 --> 42:03.900
There's this new
cop and he is trying

42:04.033 --> 42:05.900
to pin Sterling's murder on Tom.

42:06.033 --> 42:07.000
Wow.

42:08.300 --> 42:12.066
And he would never,
ever, ever, ever ask,

42:12.200 --> 42:14.600
but he really needs our help.

42:18.800 --> 42:19.767
Ah...

42:23.967 --> 42:30.734
You know, Goldy, I would
really love to help Tom.

42:30.867 --> 42:32.000
You know, I would,

42:32.133 --> 42:35.333
but I can't tell you
anything about someone

42:35.467 --> 42:37.333
from the wedding party
who came to my office

42:37.467 --> 42:39.567
Saturday afternoon
with a broken hand

42:39.700 --> 42:42.333
and a really lame excuse
on how that happened.

42:42.467 --> 42:43.333
Mm-hmm.

42:43.467 --> 42:44.900
See, I could lose my license.

42:45.033 --> 42:46.400
Of course.

42:46.533 --> 42:48.166
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:48.300 --> 42:50.667
So I'm just gonna
go look for a coffee

42:50.800 --> 42:52.567
to pair with my eclair.

42:52.700 --> 42:53.834
Okay.

42:53.967 --> 42:57.300
Yeah, I might be
10, maybe 15 minutes.

43:13.266 --> 43:19.734
Ray.

43:19.867 --> 43:20.734
Oh, hey.
- Hey.

43:20.867 --> 43:22.233
Are you cleared?

43:22.367 --> 43:23.400
Yeah. No.

43:23.533 --> 43:24.834
No, not yet.

43:24.967 --> 43:25.834
Thanks for coming to get me.

43:25.967 --> 43:28.000
Yeah, I was so worried.

43:30.633 --> 43:32.400
Maybe you should
keep your distance.

43:32.533 --> 43:33.900
Stop, don't even do that.

43:34.033 --> 43:38.000
Nobody believes that you had
anything to do with this.

43:38.133 --> 43:39.567
It's not that.

43:39.700 --> 43:43.000
It's something Track
said about my dad.

43:44.033 --> 43:48.166
What about him?

43:48.300 --> 43:51.166
I haven't shared
this with anyone,

43:51.300 --> 43:53.166
but my dad's in prison.

43:59.133 --> 44:00.800
See, that's the look. That's
why I don't talk about it.

44:00.934 --> 44:02.400
I'm sorry, I...

44:07.200 --> 44:09.300
I have a lot of questions.

44:09.433 --> 44:13.233
But first, how does Track
even know about this?

44:16.033 --> 44:19.567
It was his dad
that put my dad away.

44:19.700 --> 44:20.800
And you're afraid he's gonna

44:20.934 --> 44:22.967
use that information
against you?

44:23.100 --> 44:27.900
Look, I just, I wanted you
to know before anybody else.

44:29.367 --> 44:30.967
I'm sorry.

44:31.100 --> 44:32.400
Thanks.

44:32.533 --> 44:34.567
You are not your dad.

44:34.700 --> 44:36.066
And whatever he did,

44:36.200 --> 44:40.400
it doesn't change who you
are or what you mean to me.

44:43.200 --> 44:49.066
Or you know, there are
people, other people and hey,

44:49.200 --> 44:50.967
welcome to the club.

44:51.100 --> 44:53.133
Everyone in Elk Park has
been a suspect for murder

44:53.266 --> 44:57.567
at some point in this
past year, including me.

44:57.700 --> 44:59.633
And you're still talking to me.

44:59.767 --> 45:01.800
Well, the night's still young.

45:01.934 --> 45:06.266
Let's
go get your car.

45:13.166 --> 45:14.800
So Ray showed up the
morning of the wedding

45:14.934 --> 45:18.133
with a busted hand, but
he didn't have a cast.

45:18.266 --> 45:19.867
He flinched and
Mason shook his hand.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.367
Which begs the question, when
exactly did Ray do it and how?

45:23.500 --> 45:26.200
Well, I'm headed to the
ground search right now,

45:26.333 --> 45:27.967
and Ray will be there.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.700
So why don't you go home
and then you come back later

45:30.834 --> 45:34.200
and we can put our
heads together?

45:34.333 --> 45:35.533
Okay. Okay.

45:49.767 --> 45:52.967
Look out, coming through.

45:53.100 --> 45:54.066
That's my
best friend's wedding.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.100
Come on.

45:56.266 --> 45:59.000
No!

45:59.133 --> 46:00.166
Ray, I...

46:06.667 --> 46:10.100
Here, you and I,
we'll go up here.

46:12.233 --> 46:14.266
You remember these woods?

46:14.400 --> 46:15.867
We'd come here,
me with Sterling.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.200
You with that Freckly ginger.

46:18.333 --> 46:19.266
Freddy.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.367
My gosh. Yes.

46:21.500 --> 46:25.300
Such innocent and happy
times until it wasn't.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.767
I couldn't help but
notice you and Ray earlier.

46:31.900 --> 46:33.600
Is everything okay?

46:33.734 --> 46:37.200
I found an engagement
ring in a suitcase,

46:37.333 --> 46:39.033
and when I asked about it,

46:39.166 --> 46:42.867
Ray admitted he was going
to propose this weekend.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.633
That's wonderful?

46:46.166 --> 46:49.100
Except I said I'm not ready.

46:49.233 --> 46:50.266
He didn't buy it.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.867
He thinks there's
something more.

46:53.000 --> 46:53.867
Is there?

46:54.000 --> 46:55.033
No.

46:55.166 --> 46:56.533
No, timing is everything.

46:56.667 --> 46:59.133
And with all this going on...

47:02.400 --> 47:04.000
Well, relationships are hard,

47:04.133 --> 47:05.333
even on their good days.

47:05.467 --> 47:07.166
You'll get through it.

47:07.300 --> 47:08.266
Yeah.

47:09.567 --> 47:13.500
He's my person, but
Ray can be insecure.

47:13.633 --> 47:15.433
Sterling's ribbing at
the rehearsal dinner

47:15.567 --> 47:18.333
about getting back together
with me didn't help.

47:18.467 --> 47:20.433
Anyway, it's like
Ray and I always say,

47:20.567 --> 47:23.600
there's nothing more
important than love.

47:23.734 --> 47:28.734
Never take it for granted
because it can be too late.

47:28.867 --> 47:30.000
I'll never love again.

47:30.133 --> 47:32.166
Of course you will.

47:32.300 --> 47:35.266
No, "I'll Never Love Again."

47:35.400 --> 47:37.100
It's a book.

47:37.233 --> 47:39.433
Wait, Jess was reading that.

47:39.567 --> 47:41.667
I lent it to her.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.266
Okay. Don't touch anything.

47:43.400 --> 47:44.834
Flag it and I'll,
I'll grab a cop.

47:44.967 --> 47:45.934
Hey, over here.

47:46.066 --> 47:47.934
I think I found something.

47:55.066 --> 47:57.166
It's Jess's cell.

47:57.300 --> 47:58.400
She loved her
Zuwalksi Crystals.

47:58.533 --> 47:59.433
Loved?

47:59.567 --> 48:00.700
It's okay.

48:00.834 --> 48:03.333
You referred to her
in the past tense.

48:03.467 --> 48:05.567
You know what I mean.

48:05.700 --> 48:08.500
Why would I ever want
anything to happen to her?

48:08.633 --> 48:09.567
You'd get sole possession

48:09.700 --> 48:11.066
of Whitetail Realty for one.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.900
With her gone, my
workload has just doubled.

48:13.033 --> 48:14.667
I have to take on
all of her clients.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.567
And we all know you weren't
a fan of Jess or Sterling.

48:16.700 --> 48:17.667
I have nothing against them.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.066
We just had
different priorities,

48:19.200 --> 48:20.567
and I'm tired of them
taking my dad for a ride.

48:20.700 --> 48:23.400
Hey, will you just
stop it, the both of you?

48:23.533 --> 48:26.400
Can't you see what
you're doing to my wife?

48:26.533 --> 48:28.200
My apologies.

48:28.333 --> 48:29.333
Sorry.

48:31.467 --> 48:33.500
It's okay.

48:33.633 --> 48:36.166
God, this is just
so distressing.

48:36.300 --> 48:38.000
What can I do to help?

48:38.133 --> 48:41.900
We're
holding a candlelight vigil

48:42.033 --> 48:44.900
outside our home this evening.

48:45.033 --> 48:47.333
Do you think you could do a
rush order on some finger food?

48:47.467 --> 48:48.667
Just whatever you can--

48:48.800 --> 48:50.667
Of course, I'll
drop them off later.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.233
Thank you.

48:52.367 --> 48:53.834
Yeah, I'm a mess.

48:54.967 --> 48:56.000
Where's my, where's my Jess?

48:56.133 --> 48:57.066
I mean, where could she be?

48:57.200 --> 48:58.133
We'll find her.

48:58.266 --> 48:59.166
We'll find her.

49:22.066 --> 49:22.934
Hi Goldy.

49:23.066 --> 49:24.200
Hi.

49:24.333 --> 49:25.266
Your food was a huge
hit with the kids.

49:25.400 --> 49:26.266
Thanks again.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.867
Thank you.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.867
And I'm sorry about earlier
at the park with Chester.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.867
I got carried away.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.367
You don't need to apologize
to me, I understand.

49:36.500 --> 49:38.533
Emotions are running
high right now.

49:38.667 --> 49:39.934
Yeah.

49:40.066 --> 49:41.200
Feels like it's been one
nonstop fight since the wedding

49:41.333 --> 49:42.700
came to town.

49:42.834 --> 49:44.033
First, the one at the reception,

49:44.166 --> 49:45.934
then the one the
parking lot after.

49:46.066 --> 49:48.934
What, what happened
in the parking lot?

49:49.066 --> 49:50.433
Well, I only caught
the tail end of it,

49:50.567 --> 49:54.367
but Chester and Sterling
were at it again.

49:54.500 --> 49:57.700
And obviously Chester didn't
come out of it too well.

49:57.834 --> 49:58.767
See ya.
- Yeah.

50:03.734 --> 50:08.266
Hey, one dopeo double
espresso macchiato.

50:08.400 --> 50:09.433
Thank you.

50:09.567 --> 50:10.700
Let's get to work.

50:10.834 --> 50:11.867
Yes.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.700
And working on
Ann's rushed order.

50:14.834 --> 50:15.767
Ooh!

50:15.900 --> 50:16.867
Hold on.

50:18.333 --> 50:19.433
Hey Marla.

50:19.567 --> 50:21.100
He's right outside my shop.

50:21.233 --> 50:22.433
I dunno.

50:22.567 --> 50:24.100
Who's right outside your shop?

50:24.233 --> 50:26.100
Ray, you said you
wanted to talk to him.

50:26.233 --> 50:27.600
If you hurry up,
you can catch him.

50:27.734 --> 50:30.700
Just be careful because
Mason and Track are here.

50:30.834 --> 50:32.266
Okay. Thank you.

50:32.400 --> 50:33.266
What's up?

50:33.400 --> 50:34.266
Ray is outside Marla's shop.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.200
Well, let's go talk to him.

50:36.333 --> 50:39.033
You can't be be seen
interrogating Ray.

50:39.166 --> 50:40.367
And I can't leave my dough

50:40.500 --> 50:43.367
or the baking
powder will go flat.

50:46.000 --> 50:50.800
I have a crazy idea.

50:53.834 --> 50:57.367
Okay, you wanna preheat
the oven to 350.

50:57.500 --> 50:59.767
You're gonna roll
the dough evenly.

50:59.900 --> 51:02.934
Then you're gonna add a
teaspoon of the filling,

51:03.066 --> 51:06.433
first the cheese, then
the mushroom mixture.

51:06.567 --> 51:09.266
You wanna pinch the edges of
the dumpling and then brush

51:09.400 --> 51:11.767
each dumpling with the egg wash.

51:11.900 --> 51:13.066
Then you bake.

51:14.233 --> 51:15.333
Are you good?

51:15.467 --> 51:16.934
You lost me after
preheat the oven.

51:17.066 --> 51:21.533
You'll be fine,
just don't overwork the dough.

51:23.133 --> 51:24.767
But you know, that
goes for you too, okay?

51:24.900 --> 51:26.934
Don't press Ray too hard
or he's gonna clam up.

51:27.066 --> 51:28.433
Okay.

51:28.567 --> 51:31.266
Find out how he broke
his hand, but act natural.

51:31.400 --> 51:32.767
Act natural.

51:32.900 --> 51:33.767
Got it.

51:33.900 --> 51:35.433
All right. I see him.

51:38.133 --> 51:39.767
I'm switching to Bluetooth.

51:39.900 --> 51:41.000
Okay.

51:41.133 --> 51:42.767
Well, there's a $300
charge on my credit card

51:42.900 --> 51:44.000
that I never authorized.

51:44.133 --> 51:46.433
I'd like the charges
reversed please.

51:46.567 --> 51:47.500
Car key replacement?

51:47.633 --> 51:49.767
What are you talking about?

51:49.900 --> 51:51.767
The contract never said...

51:51.900 --> 51:54.734
Ah, fine.

51:55.967 --> 51:58.433
Stupid car rental
agency is sh...

51:58.567 --> 52:01.000
Ray, hi!

52:01.133 --> 52:03.233
It's so funny meeting you here.

52:03.367 --> 52:04.233
Hey, Goldy.

52:04.367 --> 52:06.000
I said act natural.

52:06.133 --> 52:08.000
Whoa, your cast.

52:08.133 --> 52:09.567
How did that happen?

52:09.700 --> 52:10.667
Easy, Berry.

52:10.800 --> 52:11.734
It's too heavy handed.

52:11.867 --> 52:12.967
I'm trying.

52:14.467 --> 52:16.333
You're trying?

52:16.467 --> 52:18.500
Focus, Goldy.

52:18.633 --> 52:22.767
Trying to understand
what happened to your hand.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.567
You look like you got
yourself in a pickle.

52:26.700 --> 52:27.567
A pickle?

52:27.700 --> 52:29.000
It's nothing.

52:29.133 --> 52:31.266
I just fell in the shower.

52:32.367 --> 52:38.333
Wow, it just must have
been a really hard fall.

52:38.467 --> 52:40.066
You lost him, Barry.

52:40.200 --> 52:42.333
You did it, you
overworked the dough.

52:42.467 --> 52:46.567
Okay, I cannot do this
with you in my ear, okay?

52:46.700 --> 52:49.600
Just don't burn my
pastry, Schultz.

52:51.633 --> 52:52.600
Barry.

52:53.700 --> 52:56.333
Goldy?

52:56.467 --> 52:57.333
You know what?

52:57.467 --> 52:58.834
Let me help you.

52:58.967 --> 53:00.233
Thank you.

53:00.367 --> 53:01.333
Of course.

53:04.033 --> 53:06.800
Got some orange
smudge on your cast.

53:06.934 --> 53:08.300
Oh, yeah.

53:08.433 --> 53:10.233
It was these cheesy crackers
Ann was giving everyone,

53:10.367 --> 53:12.467
we were all snacking on them.

53:12.600 --> 53:13.600
Casa...

53:13.734 --> 53:14.700
Cassava.

53:15.767 --> 53:17.233
They uh, they get everywhere.

53:17.367 --> 53:19.066
Yeah, probably not a good idea

53:19.200 --> 53:22.667
to have everyone sign
my cast afterwards.

53:27.100 --> 53:30.567
We uh, we missed you
at the ground search.

53:30.700 --> 53:33.900
Yeah, I just needed
some time alone.

53:35.433 --> 53:36.567
I can't believe he's gone.

53:36.700 --> 53:39.400
Some best man I
turned out to be.

53:41.867 --> 53:45.467
Ray, this was not your fault.

53:45.600 --> 53:46.467
Yeah...

53:46.600 --> 53:47.467
I'm so sorry.

53:47.600 --> 53:50.233
I know he was your best friend.

53:51.600 --> 53:55.233
You know, I always envied
Sterling, thought he had it all.

53:55.367 --> 53:57.400
And the night
before the wedding,

53:57.533 --> 53:59.467
oh, he's getting cold feet.

53:59.600 --> 54:03.033
You think he'd have his
mind made up by then.

54:03.166 --> 54:05.467
So what did he do?

54:05.600 --> 54:08.967
Oh, he went out for
air after midnight.

54:09.100 --> 54:11.133
Next thing I know, it's
morning and he's in full tux

54:11.266 --> 54:13.367
ready to go to the church.

54:13.500 --> 54:16.633
Someone or something
changed his mind.

54:28.767 --> 54:33.800
Well, it's not a
perfect dumpling.

54:33.934 --> 54:37.633
Not exactly sure what it is.

54:37.767 --> 54:38.834
I'll add parsley.

54:38.967 --> 54:39.834
- Yeah.
- Okay.

54:39.967 --> 54:40.934
Yeah.

54:42.133 --> 54:43.033
Thanks for hanging
up on me, by the way.

54:43.166 --> 54:44.033
You were distracting me.

54:44.166 --> 54:45.467
You were going rogue.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.033
Do you wanna talk about
somebody going rogue?

54:47.166 --> 54:48.033
Stick to our day jobs?

54:48.166 --> 54:49.400
- Deal.
- Okay.

54:52.500 --> 54:57.467
I think we're gonna need
something more than parsley.

54:58.500 --> 55:02.200
Did he get cold feet?

55:02.333 --> 55:04.567
Got the candle
holder right here.

55:04.700 --> 55:05.667
Mm-hmm.

55:07.166 --> 55:08.867
You still have some flour
on your face.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.033
Hold on, you.

55:16.500 --> 55:17.567
Thanks.

55:17.700 --> 55:18.700
Yeah.

55:24.567 --> 55:27.033
- Ray was jealous.
- Yeah.

55:27.166 --> 55:29.300
Yeah, missing suitcase.

55:31.834 --> 55:33.033
We need to find out what caused

55:33.166 --> 55:34.934
Sterling's allergic reaction.

55:35.066 --> 55:37.033
I did find an orange substance

55:37.166 --> 55:38.133
in the back of Sterling's hand.

55:38.266 --> 55:39.133
- Orange.
- Yeah.

55:39.266 --> 55:40.133
You sure?

55:40.266 --> 55:41.400
Oh, positive.

55:41.533 --> 55:43.600
Because Ray had an orange
substance on his cast.

55:43.734 --> 55:46.867
He said it was from
eating cassava crackers.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.600
But cassava, it tastes nutty,

55:48.734 --> 55:51.266
but it's not from the
nut family at all.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.867
We need to talk to Chester.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.667
Yeah, let's see...

55:58.166 --> 56:00.433
Orange powder.

56:00.567 --> 56:04.200
Wow, Chester's Realty
business is booming.

56:05.567 --> 56:06.934
Yeah?

56:07.066 --> 56:10.867
Someone's making a killing
commissions this month.

56:13.567 --> 56:15.900
Wanna go house hunting?

56:16.033 --> 56:17.033
Always.

56:18.233 --> 56:22.700
Let's go.

56:32.900 --> 56:34.367
- Nice house.
- Yeah.

56:34.500 --> 56:36.867
Above my pay grade.
- Insane.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.867
Let's
take a look around.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.033
Be back here in 20.

56:45.166 --> 56:46.133
Okay.

56:47.667 --> 56:50.033
- You back--
- Okay, I'll go this way then.

56:50.166 --> 56:51.200
As you can see,

56:51.333 --> 56:52.700
there's a spectacular
chef's kitchen,

56:52.834 --> 56:56.767
newly renovated with
slide out shelves.

56:56.900 --> 56:58.266
I'll let you folks
walk around though.

56:58.400 --> 56:59.934
Let me know if you have
any questions, okay?

57:00.133 --> 57:01.433
Thank you so much.

57:01.567 --> 57:02.834
What a nice surprise.

57:02.967 --> 57:04.600
I can see you working
your magic in here.

57:04.734 --> 57:06.000
Oh, well.

57:06.133 --> 57:07.934
Unless that magic
increases my bank account,

57:08.066 --> 57:11.433
I think I'm gonna have
to stay put.

57:11.567 --> 57:13.333
So what brings you by?

57:13.467 --> 57:15.834
Oh, we're friends, right?

57:16.967 --> 57:18.333
Of course.

57:18.467 --> 57:20.600
I, I just needed to ask,

57:22.400 --> 57:25.500
why didn't you come clean
about Sterling hitting you?

57:25.633 --> 57:27.367
Because he didn't.

57:28.734 --> 57:31.667
Chester, I know you
didn't get the black eye

57:31.800 --> 57:34.567
playing basketball
like you said.

57:36.800 --> 57:37.834
Sterling didn't hit me, Goldy.

57:39.734 --> 57:41.266
He was fighting with
Ray in the parking lot

57:41.400 --> 57:43.266
after the rehearsal
dinner ended.

57:43.400 --> 57:45.000
And when the groomsman and
I went in to break them up ,

57:45.133 --> 57:47.033
my eye hit Ray's fist.

57:48.567 --> 57:49.433
Sorry I lied.

57:49.567 --> 57:51.600
I didn't wanna look suspicious.

57:51.734 --> 57:54.433
Why was Sterling fighting
his best ,an again?

57:54.567 --> 57:55.433
I'm sorry, Goldy.

57:55.567 --> 57:56.467
I have to work.

57:59.567 --> 58:01.667
I want to find Jess too.

58:01.800 --> 58:03.333
But what about Hoops for Teens?

58:03.467 --> 58:04.567
If you're willing to
spend that much on Jess's

58:04.700 --> 58:06.066
over the top wedding,

58:06.200 --> 58:08.000
then why not put it towards
something more meaningful?

58:08.133 --> 58:10.166
Now is not the time or place.

58:10.300 --> 58:12.834
When is the time, Dad?

58:12.967 --> 58:14.500
I have done everything you asked

58:14.633 --> 58:17.066
and kept it quiet
all these years.

58:17.200 --> 58:19.166
What's up fellas?

58:19.300 --> 58:21.333
You, you kept what quiet?

58:22.700 --> 58:24.000
I wouldn't have thought
this type of house

58:24.133 --> 58:26.000
would interest you, Tom.

58:26.133 --> 58:28.967
Well, lots of
things interest me.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.500
What are you doing here?

58:31.633 --> 58:33.400
I happen to own this house.

58:33.533 --> 58:35.166
This was supposed to
be Jessamyn listing,

58:35.300 --> 58:37.500
but Chester has it now.

58:37.633 --> 58:41.667
Well, why does it say
it's under Westco property?

58:41.800 --> 58:43.400
Yes, it's one of
my holding companies.

58:43.533 --> 58:44.500
Is that a problem?

58:44.633 --> 58:45.900
It's not a problem, I just,

58:46.033 --> 58:48.834
I'm just wondering
what the big secret is.

58:48.967 --> 58:51.000
Did you happen to be
involved in the, in the,

58:51.133 --> 58:53.166
in the failed software company?

58:53.300 --> 58:56.400
This is sounding like
a police interrogation.

58:56.533 --> 58:58.066
And you don't have
your badge, do you?

58:58.200 --> 59:00.066
It's just a
friendly observation.

59:00.200 --> 59:02.233
Well, I think it's
time for you to leave.

59:04.867 --> 59:08.700
Okay, well, hey, good
luck with the listing.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.233
I still think
Chester is hiding something,

59:21.367 --> 59:24.400
but at least now we know how
and when Ray broke his hand,

59:24.533 --> 59:25.734
we just don't know why.

59:25.867 --> 59:27.066
Well, in my experience,

59:27.200 --> 59:28.400
when two guys fight
after a few drinks,

59:28.533 --> 59:30.400
it's usually over a woman.

59:30.533 --> 59:31.967
And we still don't know
how Laurence and Hunter

59:32.100 --> 59:33.467
fit into all of this.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.567
And also, what is Hunter hiding?

59:35.700 --> 59:36.967
Well, I think we're
getting close to the truth.

59:37.100 --> 59:38.900
Based on Laurence's reaction.

59:39.033 --> 59:40.967
Do you really think
that Laurence is involved

59:41.100 --> 59:42.300
in all of this?

59:42.433 --> 59:44.133
I think that if
he was an investor,

59:44.266 --> 59:48.800
he sure didn't lose his
shirt like everybody else.

59:48.934 --> 59:50.567
We need to get our hands
on the police records.

59:50.700 --> 59:51.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:53.400 --> 59:54.734
What's the one thing that's
in abundance at weddings?

59:54.867 --> 59:56.066
Puff pastry.

59:56.200 --> 59:58.900
Puff, puff pastries?

59:59.033 --> 01:00:01.066
Photos, Goldy, photos.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.467
Oh, photos.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.800
That's much better.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.133
We need to talk
to the photographer.

01:00:05.266 --> 01:00:06.233
Okay.

01:00:07.367 --> 01:00:08.734
Yes.

01:00:08.867 --> 01:00:11.066
Smile, show some teeth, yes.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.066
Excuse me, hi.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.900
You, you're early.

01:00:16.433 --> 01:00:17.800
The station said a detective
would swing by later.

01:00:17.934 --> 01:00:19.633
I'm in the middle
of a photo shoot.

01:00:19.767 --> 01:00:20.967
He is the detective.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.900
- I'm the detective.
- Yep.

01:00:23.033 --> 01:00:24.967
Let's get it over with,
I'll pull up the files.

01:00:28.867 --> 01:00:30.900
Oh man.

01:00:31.033 --> 01:00:32.567
Breaks my heart a
little to see these.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.300
You have to detach
yourself in an investigation.

01:00:35.433 --> 01:00:37.400
Can't let it affect you.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:51.133
Wait a second.

01:00:51.266 --> 01:00:52.467
Hey, hey, hey.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.066
Track is here.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.066
We gotta hurry.

01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:00.967
Look at, look at this.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.200
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.300
Is that sweet,
gentle Ann slapping

01:01:04.433 --> 01:01:06.300
her soon to be son-in-law

01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:08.967
the night before he was killed?

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.533
Get a picture.

01:01:13.667 --> 01:01:17.533
Come on, close it out.

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:18.633
Thank you!

01:01:18.767 --> 01:01:20.633
Thank you very much.

01:01:32.266 --> 01:01:33.800
Hey, you got Ray.

01:01:33.934 --> 01:01:35.633
Leave a message.

01:01:35.767 --> 01:01:36.867
Ray, where are you?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.266
We're starting.

01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:53.633
I hope wherever Jess
is, she can feel the love.

01:01:53.767 --> 01:01:55.300
- Let's find the crackers.
- No.

01:01:55.433 --> 01:01:57.934
It is not the time.
- Yes.

01:01:58.066 --> 01:01:58.967
Come on, come on.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.367
Ann?

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.333
Um, this is the silliest
of questions, you know,

01:02:05.834 --> 01:02:10.934
considering, but where did
you get these crackers?

01:02:11.066 --> 01:02:16.567
I think from Hunter,
maybe, the bridal party.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.567
I don't remember.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.200
Would you, would you like some?

01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:21.367
That would, yes,
that would be great.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.033
It's always good to learn about
new snacks for parties and--

01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:26.200
Events.

01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:27.700
Charcuterie boards and...

01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:30.266
- We were throwing parties.
- I am, so many parties.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.100
Well, I think you'll
like these then.

01:02:32.233 --> 01:02:34.266
They're cassava and cheddar.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.433
They're the only things

01:02:35.567 --> 01:02:36.867
that would settle
Laurence's stomach.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.333
I got it. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:02:43.233 --> 01:02:45.934
Ann, after the
rehearsal dinner,

01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:48.033
you met Sterling
in the hotel foyer.

01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:51.233
What exactly did you say to him?

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.266
I don't recall.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.567
It was a busy day.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.700
Oh.

01:02:58.166 --> 01:03:01.600
I don't mean to make
you uncomfortable,

01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:05.767
but you slapped him.

01:03:08.967 --> 01:03:13.700
Timestamped at 12:05 AM.

01:03:17.734 --> 01:03:21.166
I, I I think what Tom is,

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.433
is trying to say is we
would understand if you had

01:03:26.567 --> 01:03:28.433
resentment towards
Sterling's family.

01:03:28.567 --> 01:03:31.266
I mean, after all, you,
you lost your house.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.333
Gosh, no.

01:03:32.467 --> 01:03:35.266
That's, that's ancient history.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.667
I mean, yeah, it was hard.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.433
Some people didn't get over
it, but many of us did.

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:43.166
I mean, look at Jess and Katie.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.333
Katie?

01:03:44.467 --> 01:03:47.600
Well, she and Sterling
were once engaged.

01:03:47.734 --> 01:03:49.433
Well, Katie moved on.

01:03:49.567 --> 01:03:51.934
Her dad never forgave Sterling's
family after almost losing

01:03:52.066 --> 01:03:55.834
his farm for investing
in that stupid startup.

01:03:55.967 --> 01:03:58.266
I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't know

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.834
that Sterling and
Katie were engaged.

01:04:01.967 --> 01:04:03.600
Didn't last long.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.333
I think Katie broke it off with
Sterling after she followed

01:04:07.467 --> 01:04:08.834
him to San Francisco.

01:04:08.967 --> 01:04:10.066
I mean, her dad would've
never given his blessing,

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.667
but it all worked
out in the end.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.767
She met Ray and my Jess
ended up with Sterling.

01:04:17.967 --> 01:04:19.900
So why were you
so mad at Sterling?

01:04:20.033 --> 01:04:22.834
He said he was gonna
call off the wedding

01:04:22.967 --> 01:04:25.000
and I wouldn't let him do that.

01:04:25.133 --> 01:04:27.500
So yes, I lost my temper,

01:04:27.633 --> 01:04:30.000
but I set him straight
because I'll do anything

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:31.000
for my daughter.

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:32.166
Anything at all.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.233
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

01:04:34.367 --> 01:04:37.467
Because it wasn't
my finest moment.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.667
Ann, I, uh...

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.166
What's going on?

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.066
Ann, what's happening?

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.300
They find Jess?

01:04:48.433 --> 01:04:49.333
No.

01:04:49.467 --> 01:04:50.567
No.

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.567
What did you do
to upset my wife?

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.000
I've asked her some
questions, Laurence.

01:04:54.133 --> 01:04:56.967
You know, I've just
about had enough outta you.

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.000
Now get outta here.

01:04:58.133 --> 01:04:59.000
Stay away from my family.

01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:00.066
- We're gonna go.
- Yeah.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.100
We are leaving.

01:05:01.233 --> 01:05:04.233
Thank you.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.600
He gets in a fight with Ray.

01:05:11.734 --> 01:05:14.367
Chester stands to
get Whitetail Realty,

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.600
and then Hunter
stands to inherit.

01:05:17.734 --> 01:05:19.700
Ann slap Sterling

01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:23.367
and also she might
be responsible for
the orange crackers.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.533
So what am I looking at?

01:05:24.667 --> 01:05:26.367
I tried to recreate
Anne's crackers.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.200
Both she and Ray said
that they were cassava,

01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:30.700
but they're not.

01:05:30.834 --> 01:05:32.533
So I whipped together
three different recipes.

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:36.834
I need you to try 'em,
starting with her original.

01:05:38.233 --> 01:05:39.867
Huh?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.834
Now try the corn flour.

01:05:45.834 --> 01:05:46.867
It's not that one.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.166
Cauliflower.

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:53.700
Not it either.

01:05:53.834 --> 01:05:57.333
No, try the one in the middle.

01:06:00.467 --> 01:06:01.333
It's that one.

01:06:01.467 --> 01:06:02.333
- Yeah.
- That's it.

01:06:02.467 --> 01:06:03.600
- Yeah.
- What is it?

01:06:03.734 --> 01:06:04.700
Avocado.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.667
- Okay. What does that mean?
- It means someone is lying.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.433
They're not cassava crackers.

01:06:09.567 --> 01:06:10.834
And the interesting
thing is that people

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.166
with tree nut
allergies, a lot of them

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.266
are severely
allergic to avocados.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.600
So Sterling was likely exposed

01:06:16.734 --> 01:06:18.600
to the allergen around 9:00 AM.

01:06:18.734 --> 01:06:21.600
And I am willing to bet
that someone saw something.

01:06:21.734 --> 01:06:24.100
Well, outside of
security cameras,

01:06:24.233 --> 01:06:26.266
what's the next best way
to get eyes on people?

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.166
Spy glasses.

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.333
Loitering teenagers
on skateboards.

01:06:32.467 --> 01:06:33.333
- That's better.
- Mm.

01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:34.433
Yeah.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.100
There he is.

01:06:45.233 --> 01:06:46.767
Mom, promise you
won't embarrass me.

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.867
What, me?

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.767
Okay, fine.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.600
All right, you stay in the car.

01:06:54.734 --> 01:06:56.367
We'll be right back.

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:07.233
Hey Lucas, I'm
Goldy, Olive's mom.

01:07:07.367 --> 01:07:10.400
And this is my friend Tom.

01:07:10.533 --> 01:07:11.834
What's up?

01:07:11.967 --> 01:07:13.033
I know who he is.

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:14.066
We can skateboard here.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.333
No one said we couldn't.

01:07:15.467 --> 01:07:16.433
Relax, relax.

01:07:16.567 --> 01:07:17.500
We're just trying to
figure out what happened

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:19.667
to Sterling Bridgewater.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.667
Yeah, have you seen anything
suspicious the last few days?

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.500
Nope, I already told the cops.

01:07:26.633 --> 01:07:28.667
Lucas, it's, it's okay.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.166
You can trust Tom and
my mom's the best.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.834
And you can trust me.

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:37.767
If there's anything you
know, just tell them.

01:07:39.867 --> 01:07:41.166
Morning of, I was
grinding with my board

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.233
somewhere I shouldn't have.

01:07:42.367 --> 01:07:44.500
Please don't tell my mom.

01:07:44.633 --> 01:07:46.066
And I saw the groom.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.667
He was like arguing with the
bride before she kissed him

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.166
and he sort of pushed her away,

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.834
and she kinda like
fell backwards.

01:07:50.967 --> 01:07:52.033
So what?

01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:54.667
So you saw the bride
and groom together

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:55.734
the morning of the wedding.

01:07:55.867 --> 01:07:57.000
Most definitely.

01:07:57.133 --> 01:08:00.233
She was in a fancy dress
with a jacket that said

01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:03.734
"besties" on it with flowers,
and he had on his tux.

01:08:03.867 --> 01:08:04.734
So.

01:08:04.867 --> 01:08:06.233
What time was that?

01:08:06.367 --> 01:08:07.433
9:00, 10:00 ish.

01:08:07.567 --> 01:08:10.066
You know what they
were arguing about?

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.734
No, I tailed
straight past 'em.

01:08:11.867 --> 01:08:14.467
Can you take us to
where that happened?

01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:18.166
Thank you.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:24.900
It was here.

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:27.066
After he pushed her, the
groom walked that way.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.400
Bride was on the ground

01:08:28.533 --> 01:08:30.800
but she was like alive
and everything, so.

01:08:30.934 --> 01:08:32.400
Okay.

01:08:32.533 --> 01:08:34.333
Okay, thank you Lucas.

01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:40.400
Mom, is it okay if me and
Lucas walk back to the van?

01:08:43.533 --> 01:08:45.066
Sure.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.600
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:46.734 --> 01:08:48.800
But go directly to the van and
text me when you get there.

01:08:48.934 --> 01:08:49.900
Okay.

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.967
I'm not a cool mom.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.567
All right, so the
morning of the wedding,

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.200
Jess and Sterling come out here.

01:09:01.333 --> 01:09:03.633
Emotions are running high,

01:09:03.767 --> 01:09:06.867
they had a big fight
the night before.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.700
So maybe they come out to talk.

01:09:09.834 --> 01:09:10.967
Okay.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.700
Jess, she goes in,
she goes to kiss him.

01:09:17.266 --> 01:09:19.800
Then he uh, pushes her.

01:09:19.934 --> 01:09:21.900
Right, she goes down.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:26.300
Sterling had an orangey
rash in the back of his hand.

01:09:26.433 --> 01:09:31.133
What do you do when you wanna
wipe a kiss off your face?

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.967
What are we missing?

01:09:41.333 --> 01:09:45.200
Rental car keys.

01:09:45.333 --> 01:09:47.700
Jessamyn would never rent a car.

01:09:47.834 --> 01:09:49.934
She's always chauffeured.

01:09:51.333 --> 01:09:55.133
Something tells me this
car is parked at the hotel.

01:10:07.266 --> 01:10:08.867
Go to the hotel.
- Okay.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:09.967
Schultz.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.367
What's up, Track?

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.967
Let's go.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.467
Under Colorado law
section 18-81-12

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.800
I'm arresting you
for class six felony,

01:10:17.934 --> 01:10:20.133
offense of a impersonating
police officer.

01:10:20.266 --> 01:10:21.800
You're making a big mistake.

01:10:21.934 --> 01:10:23.033
No.

01:10:23.166 --> 01:10:24.700
No, Tom, you did
when you interfered

01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:26.633
in an active investigation
under suspension

01:10:26.767 --> 01:10:31.200
as the prime suspect and posed
as a cop to a photographer.

01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:33.467
That's a mouthful, isn't it?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.800
Let's go.

01:10:35.934 --> 01:10:37.233
I'll be okay.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.266
Yeah, there's a $300
charge on my credit card

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.700
I never authorized.

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:47.100
She was in a fancy
dress with a jacket

01:11:47.233 --> 01:11:48.867
that said "besties" on it.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.033
She and Sterling
were once engaged.

01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:52.600
Well, Katie moved on.

01:11:52.734 --> 01:11:54.767
Her dad never forgave
Sterling's family

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.200
after almost losing his farm

01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:58.600
investing in that
stupid startup.

01:11:58.734 --> 01:12:01.100
There's nothing more
important than love.

01:12:01.233 --> 01:12:02.100
Never take it for granted,

01:12:02.233 --> 01:12:04.433
because it could be too late.

01:12:14.767 --> 01:12:17.200
Detective, the last call
Sterling made was to Jess

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.700
before he dropped the cell

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:20.767
according to a fall
detection alert software.

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.800
And...

01:12:24.767 --> 01:12:26.800
Why is Tom here?

01:12:26.934 --> 01:12:28.033
Well, our
suspect's in custody.

01:12:28.166 --> 01:12:30.367
He just needs to
confess her whereabouts.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.200
We have new evidence that
could help us crack both cases.

01:12:33.333 --> 01:12:35.300
Shut it down, Kildea.

01:12:41.934 --> 01:12:42.800
Hey.

01:12:42.934 --> 01:12:44.300
Hey.

01:12:44.433 --> 01:12:45.700
So just got back from
Whitetail, like you asked.

01:12:45.834 --> 01:12:47.467
I compared what you found
at the land registry

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.300
to the MLS listings.

01:12:49.433 --> 01:12:51.467
And guess who bought most
of the defaulted properties

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.633
after Sterling's
families skipped town?

01:12:53.767 --> 01:12:55.133
- Westco Realty.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:55.266 --> 01:12:57.133
Laurence gave out a
lot of private loans

01:12:57.266 --> 01:12:59.300
for business owners to
save their properties.

01:12:59.433 --> 01:13:01.266
So Tom's hunch about
Laurence was right.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.767
He was involved with a startup

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.367
and there's something
he's not saying.

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.367
But it doesn't matter because
I think I know who did it.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.934
You think this is gonna work?

01:13:09.066 --> 01:13:10.700
Only if Jess is alive, but
we know how small towns work.

01:13:10.834 --> 01:13:12.867
We tell one person, one
thing, and before we know it,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.400
it gets all over town and
flushes out the killer.

01:13:16.533 --> 01:13:17.433
Hopefully.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.700
- Detective?
- Mm?

01:13:44.834 --> 01:13:46.033
A witness has come
forward with new evidence

01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:48.367
on the Sterling murder.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.767
What witness, what evidence?

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.700
They only wanna
speak with you.

01:13:55.467 --> 01:13:56.367
I'm Detective Track.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.100
Hi.

01:13:58.233 --> 01:13:59.600
- You.
- Hmm.

01:13:59.734 --> 01:14:02.500
Before we begin,
I'm a little parched.

01:14:02.633 --> 01:14:03.500
Can I have some water?

01:14:03.633 --> 01:14:05.000
Sure, sparkling or still?

01:14:05.133 --> 01:14:06.000
Oh.

01:14:06.133 --> 01:14:07.667
I, I'll get it.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.734
Well, thank you Mason.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.500
Hey.

01:14:16.633 --> 01:14:19.100
What took you so long?

01:14:19.233 --> 01:14:21.567
I went as fast as I could.

01:14:25.233 --> 01:14:26.433
Mason.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.333
Okay,
what's going on?

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:31.934
What, what is this?

01:14:32.066 --> 01:14:35.433
Well, I've got some
new evidence for you.

01:14:35.567 --> 01:14:37.266
You've been barking up
the wrong tree, Davy.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.600
Have a seat.

01:14:38.734 --> 01:14:40.600
This might take a while.

01:14:40.734 --> 01:14:43.166
It's a miracle, Jess escaped.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.600
We are meeting at
Elk Park Hotel lobby.

01:15:13.633 --> 01:15:14.900
Where's Jess?

01:15:15.033 --> 01:15:16.333
Is she okay?

01:15:16.467 --> 01:15:18.734
I don't know, she
hasn't shown up yet.

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.333
Goldy?

01:15:47.467 --> 01:15:49.000
Where's Jess?

01:15:49.133 --> 01:15:51.066
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.500
Everybody else
is at the hotel,

01:15:52.633 --> 01:15:56.333
but you came here
because you wanted to see

01:15:56.467 --> 01:15:58.834
if Jess had actually escaped.

01:15:59.867 --> 01:16:04.066
So where is she?

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.400
How'd you figure it out?

01:16:06.533 --> 01:16:10.133
There was a witness who
saw Jess and Sterling kissing

01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:12.567
the morning of their wedding.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.467
But someone as
superstitious as Jess

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.400
would never see the
groom before her wedding.

01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:24.400
It was you who was kissing
and arguing with Sterling

01:16:24.533 --> 01:16:27.667
after you had eaten
avocado crackers.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.967
And after you kissed
him, he pushed you away.

01:16:39.266 --> 01:16:40.567
You lost your keys,

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:44.400
which is why Ray was
charged for an extra set.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.133
This whole time,

01:16:46.266 --> 01:16:49.066
you have been in
love with Sterling.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.233
You heard him, Goldy,

01:16:51.367 --> 01:16:53.066
he talked about
getting back together.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.400
He wasn't serious, Katie.

01:16:54.533 --> 01:16:57.233
I know that now but
between that and hearing

01:16:57.367 --> 01:16:59.233
he had cold feet, I...

01:17:00.433 --> 01:17:05.433
I thought he wanted me back.

01:17:05.567 --> 01:17:06.467
Where's Jess?

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.567
What did you do to her?

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.367
Sterling called her to
confess that I kissed him.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:17.900
He was sorry for having
doubts and fighting with her.

01:17:19.433 --> 01:17:20.967
But Jess went off on me.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.133
She was gonna tell Ray,

01:17:24.266 --> 01:17:25.967
I don't even remember
what happened next.

01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:31.033
Jess was on the floor and I,

01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:32.967
I was holding a
bloody candle holder.

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.133
So you panicked.

01:17:34.266 --> 01:17:37.734
Instead of coming clean,
you kidnapped her.

01:17:39.266 --> 01:17:41.700
You brought her somewhere here.

01:17:41.834 --> 01:17:45.633
I saw the mud and the
hay on your tires.

01:17:45.767 --> 01:17:48.400
You planted her phone, her book.

01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:53.700
You had everyone thinking
there were cassava crackers.

01:17:53.834 --> 01:17:57.300
You, you, you spread rumors
about Tommy, he lost his badge.

01:17:57.433 --> 01:17:59.367
I, I didn't know what to do.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.867
Did you just decide that
since you can't have him

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.600
then no one else can?

01:18:03.734 --> 01:18:05.934
No, I didn't know
people with nut allergies

01:18:06.066 --> 01:18:09.033
could have a problem
with avocados.

01:18:10.734 --> 01:18:13.767
I only fund out later.

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:15.533
Well, unfortunately,
it was too late, Katie.

01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:24.367
Oh!

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.367
Put that down, drop it.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.700
Got it.

01:18:40.834 --> 01:18:43.433
Katie, where's Jessamyn?

01:18:43.567 --> 01:18:45.200
I'm done talking.

01:18:48.166 --> 01:18:49.533
Look, she could be anywhere.

01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:51.200
I, I used to play hide
and secret with Katie

01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:55.867
on this farm when we were little
and I would never find her.

01:19:04.567 --> 01:19:08.333
Jess.

01:19:08.467 --> 01:19:12.667
Jess?

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.600
Jess.

01:19:15.734 --> 01:19:16.600
Jess.
- Jess.

01:19:16.734 --> 01:19:17.734
Tommy!

01:19:19.734 --> 01:19:20.633
Jess!

01:19:20.767 --> 01:19:22.266
Tommy, I'm here!

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.266
- Jess, we're coming.
- We're coming in.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.600
- Here.
- Okay.

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:34.934
Hurry up!

01:19:36.233 --> 01:19:37.600
Jess, it's okay!
It's okay.

01:19:37.734 --> 01:19:38.867
Hey, you okay?

01:19:40.066 --> 01:19:42.433
Oh, Jess!

01:19:42.567 --> 01:19:46.767
Where's Sterling?

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.934
Where's my mom?

01:19:48.066 --> 01:19:50.066
You're safe now, Jess.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.600
Wait.

01:19:52.734 --> 01:19:55.767
You were actually gonna
wear that to my wedding?

01:20:00.233 --> 01:20:01.667
A hamburger is not a sandwich.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.100
It is the literal
definition of sandwich.

01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:06.266
Bread, meat, bread.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.100
That is not how this works.
- Sandwich.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.266
- We should go.
- Yeah, okay.

01:20:29.133 --> 01:20:31.266
What's gonna happen to Katie?

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.100
She's gonna be charged.

01:20:34.233 --> 01:20:36.934
But hopefully she gets
the help that she needs.

01:20:37.066 --> 01:20:38.266
It's so sad.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:44.767
You know, all she never wanted
was to love and be loved.

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.433
Thomas.

01:20:46.567 --> 01:20:47.934
Hey.

01:20:48.066 --> 01:20:52.200
I, I just wanna thank you
both for bringing Jess back.

01:20:53.967 --> 01:20:55.000
And I want to apologize.

01:20:55.133 --> 01:20:56.934
No, no need, Laurence.

01:20:57.066 --> 01:20:59.500
- No, no, no.
- It's okay, I misjudged you.

01:20:59.633 --> 01:21:02.166
I should have said
something back in New York

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.834
when I discovered that
Sterling's dad's startup

01:21:04.967 --> 01:21:06.967
was a scam, but I didn't.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.000
Anyway, thanks again.

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.500
You're welcome.

01:21:23.467 --> 01:21:25.500
Oh man.

01:21:30.533 --> 01:21:31.834
Schultz.

01:21:31.967 --> 01:21:33.500
Track.

01:21:33.633 --> 01:21:38.667
I was told to uh, apologize.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.333
So this is me apologizing.

01:21:42.467 --> 01:21:46.333
You've been reinstated.

01:21:46.467 --> 01:21:50.834
I don't know how you two
did it, but case is closed.

01:21:50.967 --> 01:21:56.000
We did it because Goldy and
I make a really good team.

01:21:57.533 --> 01:21:59.166
Jess is under medical
evaluation, but I
got her statement.

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:00.800
Boy, did she have a lot to say.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.734
Hey.

01:22:05.867 --> 01:22:08.400
I should be mad,
but I'll let it slide

01:22:08.533 --> 01:22:12.467
since he did what I would've
done, break a few rules.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.133
No hard feelings then?

01:22:14.266 --> 01:22:15.800
Oh, there's definitely
hard feelings.

01:22:15.934 --> 01:22:20.233
Sheriff put you on traffic
duty for the next month.

01:22:21.533 --> 01:22:23.967
Sorry, Mason.

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:26.567
So does this mean
you'll be staying in town?

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.967
Depends if hamburgers make
it on your sandwich board.

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.233
Oh.

01:22:30.367 --> 01:22:33.066
You'll have to stick
around to find out.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.900
Can I give you a lift?

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:36.333
Yeah, thanks.

01:22:39.033 --> 01:22:43.133
Hah!

01:22:49.433 --> 01:22:55.633
I don't know how
I feel about that.

01:22:55.767 --> 01:22:58.467
Goldy, I wanna thank you.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.734
You don't need to thank--

01:22:59.867 --> 01:23:02.567
No, no, I do
need to thank you.

01:23:03.934 --> 01:23:05.467
You never once stopped
believing in me.

01:23:10.934 --> 01:23:15.800
Goldy, will you...

01:23:15.934 --> 01:23:18.633
Go out on a date with me?

01:23:18.767 --> 01:23:22.734
If your plate has any
room left on it, that is.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.133
You know what you
feel like when you have

01:23:26.266 --> 01:23:29.567
the really big meal
and you are so full

01:23:30.934 --> 01:23:33.133
that you couldn't
possibly eat another bite,

01:23:33.266 --> 01:23:36.033
but then you make
room for dessert?

01:23:36.166 --> 01:23:39.734
Are you suggesting
that I'm the dessert?

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:45.033
Because I'm, I'm okay with that.

01:23:47.934 --> 01:23:51.633
I'm gonna hold you to
it, okay, Ms. Berry?

01:23:51.767 --> 01:23:52.734
Okay.
