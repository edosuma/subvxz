WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.335
(gentle instrumental music)

00:33.034 --> 00:34.466
- [Man] You there?

00:35.803 --> 00:36.668
You're fucking dead.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.170
You hear me?

00:38.172 --> 00:40.372
I said you're fucking dead.

00:59.193 --> 01:02.161
(metal clattering)

01:06.500 --> 01:09.301
(phone ringing)

01:10.204 --> 01:11.703
(electronic beeping)

01:11.705 --> 01:12.771
- [Markus] Yeah.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.773
- [Zander] Markus, it's Zander.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.308
You ready for this one?

01:18.345 --> 01:22.648
This guy, he's
named Dixon Jones.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.349
His picking up little over

01:24.351 --> 01:28.120
one million cash
dollars near downtown.

01:28.122 --> 01:31.190
He goes there two
hours from now.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.492
This job is simple for you.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.127
Get cash from him,

01:35.129 --> 01:38.097
and bring to me at loading
dock near port right after.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.232
I be there three hours.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.633
Don't be late.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.235
Questions?

01:43.237 --> 01:44.336
- [Markus] No.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.537
- [Zander] Good.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.506
In few minutes, I
text you address

01:47.508 --> 01:50.242
and vehicle make and
model he will be in.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.578
I also text you picture of him.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.379
Don't lose these things,

01:54.381 --> 01:57.149
and delete this number
and text after I hang up.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.819
(gentle instrumental music)

02:00.821 --> 02:04.156
(electronic beeping)

02:23.844 --> 02:25.444
(metal thudding)

02:25.446 --> 02:26.545
(electronic beeping)

02:26.547 --> 02:29.648
(car engine running)

03:18.866 --> 03:22.301
(train engine running)

03:33.614 --> 03:36.748
(car engine running)

03:44.491 --> 03:46.225
(electronic beeping)

03:46.227 --> 03:48.927
(car engine running)

03:48.929 --> 03:52.731
(gentle instrumental music)

12:11.231 --> 12:14.032
(phone ringing)

12:17.404 --> 12:18.269
(electronic beeping)

12:18.271 --> 12:19.437
- What's up?

12:19.439 --> 12:20.872
- [Zander] I double
checked the cash.

12:20.874 --> 12:21.740
It's all here.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.941
This is good.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.008
Now I owe you.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.445
You stay safe out there, Markus.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.379
- Yeah.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.949
(electronic beeping)

12:30.951 --> 12:34.753
(gentle instrumental music)

12:59.513 --> 13:02.313
(phone ringing)

13:06.219 --> 13:08.386
(electronic beeping)

13:08.388 --> 13:09.320
- [Frank] Markus, it's Frank.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.288
You there?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.156
- Yeah.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.357
- [Frank] How you doing?

13:12.359 --> 13:13.825
Life treating you well?

13:13.827 --> 13:15.126
- I can't complain.

13:15.128 --> 13:15.960
- [Frank] That's good to hear.

13:18.198 --> 13:18.747
I got something for you,

13:18.748 --> 13:19.297
something I think will
grab your interest.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.231
You got a minute?

13:21.401 --> 13:23.168
- Yeah, what do you need?

13:23.170 --> 13:25.270
- [Frank] It's better
if we talk in person.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.871
Can you come down to my place?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.507
- What time?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.910
- [Frank] Say in
about an hour or so?

13:32.546 --> 13:33.578
- All right.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.180
- Thanks, I'll see you soon.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.950
(electronic beeping)

13:38.952 --> 13:42.554
(gentle instrumental music)

13:49.863 --> 13:51.863
Thank you for coming by, Markus.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.932
It's been crazy busy
around here lately.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.401
Now I know I asked
you earlier, man,

13:56.403 --> 13:58.970
but how'd that job go with
Caesar you did a while back?

13:59.606 --> 14:00.572
- [Markus] It was fine.

14:00.574 --> 14:01.472
What do you want?

14:01.474 --> 14:03.474
(laughing)

14:03.476 --> 14:04.843
- Typical Markus, man.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.479
I like your style, man,
your sense of business,

14:08.481 --> 14:10.381
always straight to the chase.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.935
Now I know you're
not gonna ask me

14:13.936 --> 14:16.420
how things have been
on my end. (laughing)

14:16.423 --> 14:17.889
All right, all right,

14:17.891 --> 14:20.225
I'll cut straight to the chase.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.860
I won't waste any more time.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.564
There's a man by the
name of Vernon Boyd,

14:26.566 --> 14:29.567
ex-convict, bank
robber, murderer,

14:29.569 --> 14:31.302
served 10 years in
the state penitentiary

14:31.304 --> 14:33.404
for beating down a
man with a metal bar.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.040
He also never paid me in full

14:36.042 --> 14:38.109
for a job we did down
in South America.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.446
He owes me a lot
of cash (mumbling).

14:42.449 --> 14:43.615
- [Markus] How much?

14:43.617 --> 14:46.050
- Easy peavy, don't
worry about that.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.619
Word is, him and his
guys hit a casino

14:47.621 --> 14:49.354
and walked out with $12 million.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.407
Could have been more, man,

14:52.408 --> 14:54.225
but the cops showed up
earlier than expected.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.664
This is a big
moneymaker, Markus.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.601
It's something I know
you'd wanna be a part of.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.304
(metal clicking)

15:06.306 --> 15:09.240
(papers rustling)

15:12.045 --> 15:13.978
- [Markus] What's this?

15:13.980 --> 15:16.247
- Everything you need
to know about this guy,

15:18.385 --> 15:21.019
his picture, address,

15:21.021 --> 15:22.320
warehouse where he
does business from,

15:22.322 --> 15:23.955
how many guys he's
got working for him,

15:23.957 --> 15:26.291
what he drives, wife's
middle name, everything.

15:26.293 --> 15:29.360
It's everything, if
you know what I mean.

15:31.665 --> 15:32.997
- When do you need it?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.667
- As soon as possible.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.101
I told you I was
going out of town

15:39.639 --> 15:40.989
in a couple weeks,

15:40.990 --> 15:42.340
and only call me if
you have any questions.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.574
Once you get what I need,

15:46.046 --> 15:47.245
no evidence of this guy.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.179
Understood?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.082
- Okay.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.385
- Right on, Markus.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.221
Always a pleasure to see you.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.361
I thought I heard you
left town for good.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.464
- Nah, I've been around.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.437
- You know, you and I,
we're in a risky business.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.706
Staying low key's not easy,

16:14.708 --> 16:16.174
especially around here.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.243
Do you remember what
happened to that guy

16:19.245 --> 16:21.145
I hired to do that
job up in Oakland?

16:22.415 --> 16:23.614
- Yeah, I do.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.252
- He was good at
everything he did,

16:30.657 --> 16:31.506
just like you,

16:31.507 --> 16:32.356
maybe a better driver, though.

16:32.359 --> 16:36.260
(laughing) I'm just
fucking with you, Markus.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.729
Lighten up a little bit, man.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.032
Now you've come a long way
from when you first started,

16:41.034 --> 16:43.301
and I commend you for that.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.272
Haven't seen too many
people do that around here,

16:49.476 --> 16:50.475
but just don't get cocky, man,

16:50.477 --> 16:52.076
and you'll continue to do well.

16:52.078 --> 16:56.681
Don't you ever, ever mistake
my kindness for weakness.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.382
We good?

16:59.619 --> 17:00.618
- Yeah, we're good.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.255
- [Frank] Well, then
that's all I got, man.

17:05.592 --> 17:09.394
(gentle instrumental music)

17:24.243 --> 17:25.175
- Who is it?

17:28.314 --> 17:29.247
- Frank.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.584
- [Staci] What type of job?

17:35.688 --> 17:36.821
- Money till.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.390
- What's he offering?

17:41.261 --> 17:42.393
- His typical.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.561
- [Staci] His typical?

17:45.098 --> 17:48.599
- Yeah, his typical.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.838
- Look, it's getting late,

17:53.840 --> 17:56.407
and I gotta run to the
airport to pick up Tommy.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.408
I don't really have time

17:57.410 --> 17:59.110
to discuss any of this.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.745
I'll call you later, okay?

18:03.450 --> 18:04.549
- All right, sure.

18:06.152 --> 18:09.754
(gentle instrumental music)

18:13.793 --> 18:17.095
(car engine running)

19:11.851 --> 19:14.752
(paper rustling)

20:20.353 --> 20:21.752
(electronic beeping)

20:21.754 --> 20:25.423
(camera shutter clicking)

20:43.776 --> 20:46.644
(metal clicking)

20:48.715 --> 20:49.914
(upbeat instrumental music)

20:49.916 --> 20:51.682
(watch ticking)

20:51.684 --> 20:54.785
(car engine running)

24:08.047 --> 24:09.613
(gentle instrumental music)

24:09.615 --> 24:12.683
(pencil scratching)

24:19.792 --> 24:22.793
(metal clattering)

25:09.275 --> 25:12.142
(paper rustling)

25:15.882 --> 25:16.947
- All right, hit me.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.521
(laughing)

25:25.024 --> 25:27.191
I've never been any
good at this game, man.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.659
I try.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.894
I try pretty damn hard.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.597
Yeah, I remember you
giving me a few pointers

25:33.599 --> 25:34.749
back in the day,

25:34.750 --> 25:35.900
but I don't think it's
paying any dividends.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.537
Maybe one day though, huh?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.807
So when do you leave town?

25:46.579 --> 25:48.012
- Not till the end of the month.

25:49.682 --> 25:50.581
- [Watts] Word.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.784
Guess that's when business
slows down for you?

25:54.854 --> 25:55.753
- Yeah.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.723
- You know, I'm not
always that busy myself.

26:00.960 --> 26:01.926
My wife and kids,

26:01.928 --> 26:02.826
they keep me plenty busy,

26:02.828 --> 26:04.328
and I like staying busy,

26:04.330 --> 26:06.196
but with work, you
know what I mean?

26:06.198 --> 26:07.298
Always a good thing.

26:07.300 --> 26:11.268
Making a steady income
is a necessity for me,

26:13.339 --> 26:15.239
and this business
is tough, Markus,

26:16.175 --> 26:17.575
very tough business.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.211
I think about it
from time to time,

26:21.213 --> 26:22.346
get the fuck out,

26:22.348 --> 26:26.216
maybe work in something
steady, something safe.

26:27.820 --> 26:28.886
People can get hurt,

26:30.122 --> 26:31.188
and I know you know.

26:32.592 --> 26:36.126
I've been doing this
since I was age 17,

26:37.997 --> 26:40.030
lost my youngest
brother when I was 20.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.000
- Julian.

26:43.002 --> 26:46.170
- Yeah, Julian.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.175
You know he was shot by
some of Victor's boys

26:51.177 --> 26:52.643
from south of the border,

26:53.679 --> 26:55.312
a deal we had lined
up in Glendale?

26:57.817 --> 26:58.983
It's his fault though.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.187
I gave him his
instructions perfectly,

27:03.189 --> 27:05.656
and he didn't listen.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.258
- I know.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.544
- I know you know,

27:10.545 --> 27:12.829
but the reason I bring
this up right now

27:12.832 --> 27:15.265
is because I want
us synchronized

27:15.267 --> 27:18.268
for this job and any job
that we do in the future.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.872
I tell this to anyone that
I do multiple jobs with.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.942
I wanna go home at
the end of every job.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.944
- We all do.

27:26.946 --> 27:29.880
- Good, good, that's
rule number one,

27:29.882 --> 27:31.248
always will be.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.284
I want that to be crystal
clear from day one.

27:37.390 --> 27:40.257
Okay, so Nigel called
me about this deal

27:40.259 --> 27:42.660
with Reuben in Tijuana, right?

27:44.296 --> 27:46.930
And supposedly
there's a warehouse

27:46.932 --> 27:48.132
with a pot of cash in it

27:48.134 --> 27:52.703
located Boyle Heights,
Arts District,

27:54.040 --> 27:55.406
basically the east end of LA.

27:56.409 --> 27:58.008
- Yes.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.344
- [Watts] Okay, okay, and so
this is supposedly vacant,

28:00.346 --> 28:02.446
this spot, right, where
they keep their goods,

28:02.448 --> 28:04.915
their drugs, their money,

28:04.917 --> 28:06.684
whole nine yards?

28:06.686 --> 28:07.418
- That's correct.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.756
- Listen, I know you got
a 40% split with Reuben,

28:12.758 --> 28:15.059
and you're gonna take
his end of the cash down

28:15.061 --> 28:16.427
and meet him in TJ?

28:19.699 --> 28:23.133
Okay, yeah, okay,
I'm cool with it.

28:24.470 --> 28:28.472
We can do what we agreed
to over the phone,

28:28.474 --> 28:29.907
if that's all you can do,

28:33.112 --> 28:34.712
(laughing)

28:34.714 --> 28:37.147
the 35% for me and
the 65 for you.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.017
I do got a wife and kids,

28:41.020 --> 28:43.921
a family to support.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.055
I'm just a single man.

28:48.494 --> 28:49.426
All right.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.999
However, we don't need to bring

28:56.001 --> 28:57.935
anyone else in on
this deal at all,

28:57.937 --> 29:00.104
just you and me, especially
if this place is vacant.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.371
You know how fast I work.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.477
(wood scraping)

29:16.122 --> 29:17.054
This the place?

29:18.023 --> 29:19.490
- [Markus] That's it.

29:19.492 --> 29:20.424
- Doesn't look like
nothing special.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.925
When do you wanna hit it?

29:23.095 --> 29:24.762
- Within the next two days.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.430
Reuben wants the
money early next week.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.232
- [Watts] Okay, well, that
should be plenty of time

29:28.234 --> 29:29.767
for us to prep,

29:29.768 --> 29:31.301
and I assume you already
scouted the location,

29:31.303 --> 29:34.238
the streets, in case
Five-0 shows up?

29:34.240 --> 29:35.172
- Of course.

29:37.777 --> 29:40.244
- You know, if you can
provide a floor plan,

29:40.246 --> 29:41.245
that'd be very helpful,

29:41.247 --> 29:42.546
but not necessary.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.414
I mean, yeah, you know what?

29:44.416 --> 29:48.051
Actually, yeah, I know
where the cash is located

29:48.053 --> 29:50.354
based on what Reuben
told you over the phone.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.490
Yeah, yeah,

29:53.492 --> 29:55.559
yeah, we can make this happen.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.028
This is all doable, absolutely.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.363
Check it out.

29:59.365 --> 30:02.266
If I'm not out of
here in a few minutes,

30:02.268 --> 30:03.834
just take the fuck off, man.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.936
I'll find my own way home,

30:05.938 --> 30:07.304
and once we get that money,

30:07.306 --> 30:08.906
more importantly, once
everyone gets their portion

30:08.908 --> 30:10.974
of the cash, we'll
all be happy, right?

30:12.278 --> 30:13.243
Do you want this?

30:16.549 --> 30:19.349
(wood scraping)

30:23.322 --> 30:25.122
Oof, you read my mind.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.563
(mumbling)

30:32.565 --> 30:34.198
This is good beer.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.332
You know I love light beer?

30:35.334 --> 30:37.534
Always have, it's my favorite.

30:37.536 --> 30:38.969
I don't really drink
dark beer, man.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.205
I've been drinking that
shit for like 10 years.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.940
It makes me sick.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.108
My wife, she's got me on
that rum and whiskey though.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.511
Hard alcohol, I think
that's probably number one.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.080
It keeps you sexy,
keeps you thin,

30:50.082 --> 30:51.281
don't get too full.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.284
Beer's good though
every here and there,

30:55.321 --> 30:56.920
after a few rum and whiskeys.

31:00.226 --> 31:03.961
Yeah, on that note,

31:03.963 --> 31:05.329
here's to a new endeavor.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.166
(glass clinking)

31:09.168 --> 31:10.868
(gentle instrumental music)

31:10.870 --> 31:14.037
(car engine running)

33:57.803 --> 34:00.604
(watch ticking)

34:52.824 --> 34:54.357
(metal thudding)

34:54.359 --> 34:57.427
(car engine running)

38:38.617 --> 38:41.484
(paper rustling)

38:44.956 --> 38:45.889
Thank you.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.098
(mumbling)

38:58.837 --> 38:59.769
Thank you.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.008
That's good.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.776
This shit looks real good, man.

39:07.813 --> 39:08.912
I think Reuben
should be pleased.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.447
We didn't get hurt,

39:10.449 --> 39:11.815
got what he wanted,

39:11.817 --> 39:13.516
well, I mean, we got what
we all wanted, right?

39:13.518 --> 39:15.685
No motherfucking cops
showed up either.

39:15.687 --> 39:16.519
Yeah, this should hold me up

39:16.521 --> 39:17.854
for the next little bit,

39:17.856 --> 39:19.789
least till the next gig.

39:19.791 --> 39:20.724
Got to thank you, man.

39:20.726 --> 39:21.825
I really needed the money.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.060
(gentle instrumental music)

39:24.062 --> 39:25.729
Hey, you know, vice versa, man.

39:25.730 --> 39:27.397
If I hear of any jobs that
require your specific services,

39:27.399 --> 39:29.032
I'll be sure to hit you up,

39:29.034 --> 39:29.933
good jobs too, man,

39:29.935 --> 39:30.867
pay good rate.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.770
There's some cheap ass
motherfuckers around here,

39:33.771 --> 39:35.404
and I know you know
who I'm talking about,

39:35.407 --> 39:36.706
try to rip you off,

39:37.642 --> 39:38.875
pay you half price,

39:38.877 --> 39:41.578
sometimes don't pay
nothing at all, man.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.612
It's stupid though.

39:44.649 --> 39:46.716
Reputation's everything
in this city.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.885
I'm sure it'll spread
around like wildfire.

39:52.858 --> 39:53.790
Hey, you think this
shit has changed

39:53.792 --> 39:55.425
in the last 10 years?

39:55.427 --> 39:57.494
People been coming around
from all over the country

39:57.496 --> 39:58.695
trying to make a
name for themselves,

39:58.697 --> 39:59.963
trying to live the dream.

40:01.967 --> 40:02.932
- Yeah.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.667
(laughing)

40:04.669 --> 40:05.602
- Yeah.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.005
I agree.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.674
(bag zipping)

40:13.578 --> 40:16.946
Me, myself, I try to learn
something new every day, man,

40:16.948 --> 40:19.549
whether it's about
my job or this city.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.617
I make a point of it.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.820
Other motherfuckers keep
their head in the dirt, man,

40:23.822 --> 40:25.188
and they'll stay there.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.189
It's their choice,

40:26.191 --> 40:27.123
cracks me up.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.762
All right, I'm gonna dip.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.164
I got shit to do at the crib,

40:35.634 --> 40:36.633
a few more business deals
too down the pipeline.

40:36.635 --> 40:37.867
Hopefully they work out,

40:37.869 --> 40:38.868
and if they do, I'm
gonna bring you on,

40:38.870 --> 40:40.069
but you know this city,

40:40.071 --> 40:41.504
a lot of talk,
not a lot of walk.

40:42.674 --> 40:43.973
People managing all
their bullshit, man,

40:43.975 --> 40:44.974
trying to have fun,

40:44.976 --> 40:46.176
trying to live under the sun.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.112
Anyway, call me.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.948
If I don't answer,
leave a voicemail, man.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.483
My phone's always on me.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.184
Thanks again.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.923
(gentle instrumental music)

41:06.498 --> 41:09.098
(phone chiming)

41:15.040 --> 41:17.874
(electronic beeping)

41:17.876 --> 41:18.875
- [Woman] Markus, it's me.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.743
Call me when you get this.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.882
(electronic beeping)

41:41.766 --> 41:42.632
- His debt is done.

41:42.634 --> 41:43.666
I have nothing to offer.

41:48.073 --> 41:48.972
Good.

41:53.912 --> 41:56.579
Look, I'll help you and
your brother with the debt,

41:56.581 --> 41:57.514
no one else.

42:03.622 --> 42:04.554
All right.

42:05.991 --> 42:09.125
(electronic beeping)

42:37.055 --> 42:39.889
(metal rattling)

43:00.612 --> 43:03.780
(car engine running)

43:06.751 --> 43:09.085
(footsteps)

43:10.689 --> 43:11.788
- Markus?

43:14.859 --> 43:19.596
Oh my gosh, I haven't
seen you in forever.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.764
I didn't even think
you lived here anymore.

43:22.767 --> 43:24.934
Where have you been?

43:24.936 --> 43:26.202
- I've been here in town.

43:27.205 --> 43:28.137
- Doing?

43:29.040 --> 43:29.973
- Just working.

43:31.142 --> 43:33.076
- Oh, okay.

43:34.746 --> 43:37.213
Well, don't be a stranger.

43:37.215 --> 43:40.984
You should stop by the next
time I have people over.

43:42.854 --> 43:43.786
I'm sorry.

43:43.788 --> 43:44.921
I haven't seen you in so long.

43:44.923 --> 43:46.956
I seriously thought
you had moved.

43:48.293 --> 43:50.393
Listen, the next
time I have a party,

43:50.395 --> 43:52.762
I'll give you a call,

43:52.764 --> 43:55.965
or leave a little
note on your doorstep.

43:57.035 --> 43:58.668
- Thanks.

43:58.670 --> 44:00.670
Yeah, I've just had a lot on
my mind recently with work.

44:01.740 --> 44:03.706
- Oh, well, that's
understandable,

44:04.809 --> 44:07.210
sort of going through
the same thing myself,

44:07.212 --> 44:09.178
short staffed at the office.

44:10.949 --> 44:12.782
Plus I'm taking care of my dad.

44:12.784 --> 44:15.785
He's getting older and
not doing so well, so.

44:15.787 --> 44:17.320
- I'm sorry to hear that.

44:17.322 --> 44:18.254
- Thank you.

44:20.825 --> 44:22.392
It was really good to see you.

44:23.662 --> 44:24.727
- It's good seeing you too.

44:24.729 --> 44:26.396
- I hope to see you again soon.

44:26.398 --> 44:27.864
- Absolutely, likewise.

44:29.000 --> 44:29.932
- Take care.

44:30.802 --> 44:31.734
- You too.

44:36.908 --> 44:37.840
(electronic beeping)

44:37.842 --> 44:40.443
(phone ringing)

44:46.751 --> 44:47.417
- [Watts] Good to
hear from you, sir.

44:47.419 --> 44:48.818
What's up?

44:48.820 --> 44:50.753
Haven't heard from
you in some time.

44:51.690 --> 44:52.822
- [Markus] Been busy.

44:52.824 --> 44:53.790
- [Watts] That's
what I've been told.

44:53.792 --> 44:55.258
Busy is good in this town, man.

44:56.327 --> 44:57.260
- I know.

44:58.329 --> 44:59.829
- [Watts] How can
I help you, man?

44:59.831 --> 45:03.733
- I wanna run a proposal by
you if you have a second.

45:03.735 --> 45:04.701
- [Watts] I got time.

45:04.703 --> 45:05.435
What's up?

45:06.371 --> 45:07.236
- Just meet me outside my place

45:07.238 --> 45:09.072
in about half an hour.

45:09.074 --> 45:11.374
- [Watts] All right,
I can do that.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.142
Everything good with you?

45:13.144 --> 45:14.477
- Yeah.

45:14.479 --> 45:16.079
- Good.

45:16.081 --> 45:17.180
See you soon.

45:19.718 --> 45:22.819
(electronic beeping)

45:25.390 --> 45:27.056
Damn, man, people be really

45:27.058 --> 45:28.925
hitting you up left
and right, huh?

45:30.028 --> 45:31.494
Kind of thought you was lying.

45:31.496 --> 45:33.179
I mean, I heard you was busy,

45:33.180 --> 45:34.863
but didn't know people
were hitting you up

45:34.866 --> 45:36.199
every minute of every day.

45:37.736 --> 45:39.202
- Same shit,

45:39.204 --> 45:40.303
new set of people.

45:40.305 --> 45:42.772
- Yeah, I feel that.

45:44.743 --> 45:46.809
This is one of Frank's
jobs, though, huh?

45:48.146 --> 45:49.078
- It is.

45:50.749 --> 45:52.482
- [Watts] When do you
plan on doing this?

45:54.452 --> 45:55.384
- In a few days.

45:57.455 --> 46:01.057
- Look, I'm willing to
work with you, as always,

46:01.059 --> 46:03.259
but I'm gonna need at least one

46:03.261 --> 46:06.329
or two guys of my choice
to contract on the job.

46:07.932 --> 46:09.065
- That's okay.

46:09.067 --> 46:10.533
That's why I called
you for this.

46:10.535 --> 46:11.901
- Yeah, I mean, if
there's supposed

46:11.903 --> 46:13.302
to be a grip of dudes
in this warehouse,

46:13.304 --> 46:15.371
we're gonna need at least
two or three guys total

46:15.373 --> 46:17.974
to make entry, minimum.

46:19.377 --> 46:20.309
Deal?

46:21.279 --> 46:22.411
(gentle instrumental music)

46:22.413 --> 46:23.346
- All right.

46:24.215 --> 46:25.448
Who do you have in mind?

46:26.317 --> 46:27.817
- I got a few people, man.

46:27.819 --> 46:30.453
Let me go through my
Rolodex and narrow it down.

46:30.455 --> 46:33.256
How about I give you
a call after that?

46:33.258 --> 46:35.158
I mean, most of these
people Nixon referred to me.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.392
You probably know them.

46:37.395 --> 46:38.327
- Okay.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.901
- Every time that
we worked together,

46:44.903 --> 46:46.435
it's always ended up going well,

46:47.438 --> 46:49.005
and that means a lot to me,

46:50.341 --> 46:53.242
and you, my friend, are
getting quite the reputation.

46:53.244 --> 46:54.827
I'm proud of you,

46:54.828 --> 46:56.411
and I wanna keep things
going in that same direction,

46:58.283 --> 47:01.083
but I'm gonna need a higher cut,

47:02.353 --> 47:03.886
60, 40.

47:06.224 --> 47:07.557
- I can work with that.

47:07.559 --> 47:10.960
- Good, that's good, Markus.

47:10.962 --> 47:12.829
This is an expensive
fucking city.

47:12.831 --> 47:15.131
Remember that, okay?

47:15.133 --> 47:19.302
And I'm in debt, bad debt.

47:23.374 --> 47:24.123
- How so?

47:24.124 --> 47:24.873
- Hector and his cousin, man,

47:24.876 --> 47:26.175
they helped pay off a few dudes

47:26.177 --> 47:27.410
from the east side of the city

47:27.412 --> 47:29.212
that helped me run
a job at the port.

47:30.481 --> 47:33.049
I owe those motherfuckers
quite a few dollars,

47:36.120 --> 47:38.187
but I ain't heard
Frank's name in a minute.

47:40.124 --> 47:41.524
I heard that motherfucker
was laying low

47:41.526 --> 47:42.458
since the surgery,

47:42.460 --> 47:43.860
spending time with family.

47:47.232 --> 47:48.631
He's a real fucking asshole.

47:50.635 --> 47:52.068
I never really liked him.

47:53.304 --> 47:54.871
- Yeah, me either.

47:57.308 --> 48:00.509
- But his jobs do bring
in a lot of money.

48:01.579 --> 48:03.096
At the end of the day,

48:03.097 --> 48:04.614
I guess that's all that
really matters, right?

48:07.585 --> 48:09.886
Yeah, fuck all that
bullshit, though, man.

48:09.888 --> 48:10.920
How's Staci doing?

48:11.923 --> 48:13.322
- She's good.

48:13.324 --> 48:14.257
- Good.

48:15.460 --> 48:16.993
I'm glad, man.

48:16.994 --> 48:18.527
I'm really, really glad
to hear that about her.

48:21.099 --> 48:22.265
My wife's been stressing me out

48:22.267 --> 48:23.332
a little bit lately.

48:24.602 --> 48:27.003
Ain't been doing too well
in the money department.

48:29.908 --> 48:31.407
I'm trying to buy her a house,

48:33.111 --> 48:34.277
but I can't afford it.

48:36.915 --> 48:39.315
Only places you can afford
are the surrounding areas

48:39.317 --> 48:40.182
outside of the city,

48:40.184 --> 48:41.484
and who the fuck wants

48:41.486 --> 48:45.187
to live in Santa Clarita,
right? (laughing)

48:48.126 --> 48:50.693
Anyway, look,

48:53.064 --> 48:54.430
I got to go.

48:54.432 --> 48:55.264
It's late.

48:55.266 --> 48:56.332
We can talk tomorrow.

48:57.602 --> 48:59.468
Send me that picture.

48:59.470 --> 49:02.371
Floor plan of the warehouse
and all that would be good.

49:04.709 --> 49:07.643
Cool, I'll see you later.

49:08.613 --> 49:12.415
(gentle instrumental music)

49:17.288 --> 49:19.989
(electronic beeping)

49:19.991 --> 49:22.591
(phone ringing)

49:25.430 --> 49:26.462
- [Woman] Hey.

49:26.464 --> 49:27.396
- Still need a ride?

49:27.398 --> 49:29.265
I called back, no answer.

49:29.267 --> 49:30.199
- No, I'm good.

49:30.201 --> 49:31.267
I found one from my sister.

49:31.269 --> 49:32.234
Thanks, though.

49:32.236 --> 49:34.070
What's been going on?

49:34.072 --> 49:36.605
- Just busy on more work stuff.

49:36.607 --> 49:39.375
- [Woman] Tommy's still offering
you a job if you want it.

49:39.377 --> 49:40.242
- We'll see.

49:40.244 --> 49:41.077
How's Vince?

49:41.079 --> 49:41.744
- [Woman] He's good.

49:41.746 --> 49:43.312
Surgery went well.

49:43.314 --> 49:46.515
Doctor said he will be fully
recovered in six weeks.

49:46.517 --> 49:49.218
We're having his going
away party next week.

49:49.220 --> 49:50.286
You should come.

49:50.288 --> 49:51.153
- That's good.

49:51.155 --> 49:52.455
I'll see.

49:52.457 --> 49:53.322
Well, let's talk later.

49:53.324 --> 49:54.523
I gotta run.

49:54.525 --> 49:57.460
- [Woman] Okay,
talk soon, Markus.

49:58.663 --> 50:01.764
(electronic beeping)

50:05.403 --> 50:08.204
(phone ringing)

50:11.042 --> 50:12.541
- [Frank] Markus,
what's going on?

50:12.543 --> 50:14.377
I called you earlier
and no answer.

50:15.413 --> 50:16.779
Thanks for calling me back.

50:18.182 --> 50:20.649
What's the deal
with the money, man?

50:20.651 --> 50:22.018
- I need more time.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.786
- [Frank] How much
time we talking about?

50:25.423 --> 50:27.023
- Two days.

50:27.025 --> 50:27.757
- [Frank] Well, get on it.

50:27.759 --> 50:29.091
I'm going out of town soon.

50:31.562 --> 50:34.563
- Look, I'll have
your fucking money.

50:35.566 --> 50:36.799
After I get the money,

50:36.801 --> 50:38.734
that'll be the end of
our business together.

50:38.736 --> 50:41.604
- [Frank] All right,
Markus, whatever you say.

50:41.606 --> 50:42.738
Just call me when
you have my cash

50:42.740 --> 50:43.739
so we can meet up.

50:48.613 --> 50:51.313
(electronic beeping)

50:51.315 --> 50:55.084
(gentle instrumental music)

50:56.354 --> 50:59.288
(liquid spraying)

51:03.461 --> 51:06.395
(glass squeaking)

51:09.500 --> 51:12.301
(phone ringing)

51:18.576 --> 51:20.376
(gentle instrumental music)

51:20.378 --> 51:23.546
(electronic beeping)

51:24.382 --> 51:27.249
(metal thudding)

51:58.449 --> 52:01.617
(car engine running)

52:12.497 --> 52:13.696
- So there are these guys.

52:13.698 --> 52:15.631
They want to meet with
you near Chinatown.

52:16.534 --> 52:18.234
They have two jobs.

52:18.236 --> 52:18.901
I vouch for you.

52:18.903 --> 52:19.869
They know your price.

52:19.871 --> 52:20.736
They pay in full.

52:20.738 --> 52:21.704
It's no problem,

52:21.706 --> 52:23.572
but I wanted to speak with you

52:23.574 --> 52:25.841
before I move forward with them

52:25.843 --> 52:27.843
because I know we
didn't talk much

52:27.845 --> 52:30.579
about cash you got
from Dixon Jones,

52:30.581 --> 52:31.747
but from what you tell me,

52:31.749 --> 52:34.884
everything went
pretty good, right?

52:34.886 --> 52:36.886
So I counting on
you for this one.

52:38.723 --> 52:39.922
- [Markus] Go on.

52:39.924 --> 52:44.326
- Okay, so this
jobs, is two of them.

52:44.328 --> 52:45.728
First is driving job,

52:45.730 --> 52:47.696
is easy for you, no problem,

52:47.698 --> 52:50.766
but second, little
bit more complicated.

52:50.768 --> 52:53.335
There is this man.

52:53.337 --> 52:55.304
They need you to track him down,

52:55.306 --> 52:56.872
bring him to them.

52:56.874 --> 53:00.543
This man, he had a job
for his father's business,

53:00.545 --> 53:01.877
caused it to crash.

53:01.879 --> 53:04.747
At the time, the cops,
they were all over it,

53:04.749 --> 53:07.316
but now things little
bit more quiet.

53:08.452 --> 53:13.489
He owes them explanation.

53:14.725 --> 53:16.458
(gentle instrumental music)

53:16.460 --> 53:18.494
- Okay, I'll hear
what they have to say.

53:18.496 --> 53:22.798
- Good, good, this is good
opportunity for you, Markus.

53:23.801 --> 53:24.767
Trust me.

53:24.769 --> 53:26.235
There will be more work for you,

53:26.237 --> 53:28.971
but these guys, I
want to help them

53:28.973 --> 53:31.807
because of contacts they
have in New York City.

53:32.910 --> 53:35.244
Oh, and thank you
for collecting me,

53:35.246 --> 53:35.911
giving me ride,

53:35.913 --> 53:37.513
is very nice night.

53:37.515 --> 53:39.582
It's better that
we talk in person,

53:39.584 --> 53:41.584
much safer than on telephone.

53:42.687 --> 53:46.488
(gentle instrumental music)

53:53.497 --> 53:56.532
(car engine running)

53:57.835 --> 54:00.803
- You know, this place used
to belong to my grandfather.

54:00.805 --> 54:02.805
He used to use this
place for his business,

54:02.807 --> 54:05.274
repairing shoes
for big movie stars

54:05.276 --> 54:06.976
and movie productions.

54:06.978 --> 54:09.745
He had all the tools
he wanted in here.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.647
All the big names in
Hollywood would come

54:11.649 --> 54:13.282
and get their shoes G-ed up,

54:13.284 --> 54:15.584
ready for their movie premiers.

54:15.586 --> 54:18.420
Shit, they'd even come
and get shoes made,

54:18.422 --> 54:19.355
custom made.

54:20.291 --> 54:22.424
- Wow, I can see a lot of work

54:22.426 --> 54:24.960
coming from that
industry just by itself.

54:24.962 --> 54:26.328
- Yeah, the Hollywood industry

54:26.330 --> 54:28.264
was one of his
biggest customers.

54:29.533 --> 54:32.735
On Fridays, they would have a
huge line out the back door,

54:32.737 --> 54:34.370
definitely their busiest day.

54:35.706 --> 54:36.939
I remember me and my cousins

54:36.941 --> 54:40.009
would come every once
and a while, help out.

54:40.011 --> 54:42.278
Man, he made a shit
load of money, man.

54:43.748 --> 54:45.814
- So what happened
to the business?

54:45.816 --> 54:47.983
Did it get passed on
down the family, or what?

54:47.985 --> 54:49.051
- Nah, he sold it.

54:50.988 --> 54:52.688
He got too old to run it,

54:52.690 --> 54:54.723
started having health
issues with his heart

54:54.725 --> 54:55.991
and a bunch of other stuff.

54:57.461 --> 54:59.662
Family didn't wanna
take over the business.

55:00.931 --> 55:03.465
You have to have passion
and dedication to run this,

55:04.568 --> 55:06.969
a lot of work, a
lot of hard labor,

55:06.971 --> 55:08.337
but I'll tell you what.

55:09.473 --> 55:11.573
This business made
him a lot of money,

55:13.444 --> 55:14.877
gave him a good life,

55:15.880 --> 55:18.647
and he bought his house
when he was young,

55:18.649 --> 55:19.982
bought any car he wanted.

55:21.452 --> 55:25.954
Me personally, I chose a
completely different career,

55:25.956 --> 55:26.889
as you know.

55:27.725 --> 55:28.657
- I can see.

55:30.494 --> 55:32.061
You know, my old man
used to own a restaurant

55:32.063 --> 55:33.862
in the town we once lived in.

55:33.864 --> 55:34.697
- [Frank] Nice.

55:34.699 --> 55:36.065
- Yeah.

55:36.067 --> 55:37.566
He never had any
time to spend with me

55:37.568 --> 55:38.734
and my brothers though.

55:38.736 --> 55:43.005
He was always working
nonstop, seven days a week,

55:44.642 --> 55:46.408
just so he can bring in
money to feed the family.

55:46.410 --> 55:47.509
You know what I mean?

55:49.647 --> 55:51.080
But he made ends meet.

55:51.082 --> 55:52.881
He always paid
his bills on time.

55:54.085 --> 55:56.418
I remember as a
kid just seeing him

55:56.420 --> 55:59.722
going through a ton of stress,

56:01.425 --> 56:03.525
the weight of the
world on his shoulders.

56:07.031 --> 56:10.065
His whole thing was he wanted

56:10.067 --> 56:12.067
to own his own restaurant

56:12.069 --> 56:13.736
and run his own cards.

56:14.672 --> 56:15.738
That was his dream.

56:15.740 --> 56:19.041
At least, that's what
my auntie tells me.

56:19.043 --> 56:20.709
- Yeah, nothing like
working for yourself.

56:20.711 --> 56:21.643
That's for sure.

56:24.382 --> 56:26.082
Chris mentioned
you wanted to talk

56:26.083 --> 56:27.783
about the job you guys
did for me in Mexico.

56:29.420 --> 56:33.722
- Yeah, Chris is
a straightforward
guy, as you know,

56:34.759 --> 56:36.859
that thinks we both
deserve a second chance.

56:36.861 --> 56:37.926
I agree with him.

56:37.928 --> 56:42.664
I think we didn't
fulfill the obligations

56:42.666 --> 56:44.466
on the previous job like
you really wanted, so.

56:44.468 --> 56:45.801
- What are you talking about?

56:45.803 --> 56:46.769
Of course you did.

56:48.873 --> 56:50.072
- [Edwin] Really?

56:50.074 --> 56:51.640
- Yeah, don't listen
to that bullshit.

56:51.642 --> 56:52.908
You guys did a great job.

56:54.712 --> 56:57.479
Everything came in
on time as expected.

56:58.682 --> 57:00.182
Listen, Chris knows
how I work, man.

57:00.184 --> 57:01.583
We've done many jobs together.

57:01.585 --> 57:02.751
We go way back,

57:04.755 --> 57:06.021
and I trust his loyalty.

57:07.792 --> 57:09.024
He told you that, right?

57:10.094 --> 57:11.026
- He did.

57:12.496 --> 57:14.696
- Well, then he should know
it went well in Mexico.

57:15.833 --> 57:17.032
Must have been a
misunderstanding on his part

57:17.034 --> 57:19.067
'cause if there was
something wrong,

57:19.069 --> 57:20.969
I would have definitely
let him know,

57:25.142 --> 57:27.643
but I think you and I
can work together, man.

57:27.645 --> 57:30.913
I think we could
work something out.

57:30.915 --> 57:32.114
Got a few things
going on right now,

57:32.116 --> 57:33.982
but I'm waiting on
a big money job.

57:35.052 --> 57:37.519
Then I could expand my business,

57:37.521 --> 57:40.155
invest, and run a
good operation here.

57:41.192 --> 57:42.124
- I hear you.

57:43.661 --> 57:45.594
Well, let's work something out.

57:45.596 --> 57:46.795
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.

57:46.797 --> 57:47.930
We will.

57:47.932 --> 57:49.064
(laughing)

57:49.066 --> 57:50.032
Speaking of Chris, man,

57:50.034 --> 57:52.000
what's he doing these days?

57:52.002 --> 57:54.670
- [Edwin] Chris is living
up in the Valley right now.

57:54.672 --> 57:55.671
He's working with a couple guys

57:55.673 --> 57:57.072
he met on a job in Philly.

57:58.709 --> 57:59.842
- Is that right?

57:59.844 --> 58:01.009
- Yeah, man,

58:02.146 --> 58:04.513
he's doing really good though.

58:04.515 --> 58:06.849
He's just spending a lot of time

58:06.851 --> 58:09.952
on a few different
states, networking,

58:09.954 --> 58:11.753
trying to bring
in the big bucks.

58:12.990 --> 58:14.122
He's been putting
a lot of energy

58:14.124 --> 58:16.725
and focus into
Chicago and Philly.

58:16.727 --> 58:18.527
- That's good to hear.

58:18.529 --> 58:20.162
Sounds like he's on a good path.

58:21.665 --> 58:23.198
I worked in Chicago
for a few years

58:23.200 --> 58:24.633
before coming to LA,

58:25.769 --> 58:26.935
lot of work there if you network

58:26.937 --> 58:28.537
and make a name for yourself,

58:29.240 --> 58:30.572
kind of like here,

58:30.574 --> 58:32.741
but this city's where
the hub is, man.

58:32.743 --> 58:34.576
It's where all the work is at,

58:34.578 --> 58:36.979
all the traffic, just
like Miami, right?

58:36.981 --> 58:40.115
- Absolutely, it's the
reason why I'm here, man,

58:40.117 --> 58:42.017
best place for taking scores.

58:43.554 --> 58:46.788
Miami, been back
and forth there,

58:47.658 --> 58:49.291
not my cup of tea, you know?

58:49.293 --> 58:50.592
It's too fucking hot.

58:51.929 --> 58:53.596
- Yeah, I don't
like it either, man,

58:53.597 --> 58:55.264
but I'll take it over
the cold snow any day.

58:58.168 --> 59:01.737
All right, man, I'll be
giving you a call, man.

59:01.739 --> 59:02.938
I'll stay in touch.

59:02.940 --> 59:04.239
As soon as these
jobs come through,

59:05.142 --> 59:07.142
I'll be reaching out to you.

59:07.144 --> 59:08.310
Sounds like a plan.

59:08.312 --> 59:09.778
- [Frank] Right on, man.

59:12.149 --> 59:15.951
(gentle instrumental music)

59:31.969 --> 59:34.836
(metal clicking)

59:38.909 --> 59:41.710
(phone ringing)

59:59.296 --> 01:00:01.964
(bag zipping)

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:27.189
(car engine running)

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:50.812
(metal thudding)

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.214
- Man, what's up?

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:56.852
- Virgil, this is Markus.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.353
Markus, this is Virgil.

01:00:58.355 --> 01:01:00.989
- You know, I know your
face from somewhere, man.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.791
I'm pretty sure we
worked together on a job,

01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:06.795
maybe two years ago or--

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:10.032
- Anyway, anyway, he's
gonna be helping us out.

01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:11.733
He knows Nixon,

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:13.135
so here's the deal.

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:14.436
If we're not out of here
in three minutes or less,

01:01:14.438 --> 01:01:15.404
take the fuck off.

01:01:15.406 --> 01:01:17.305
We'll find our own ride home.

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:20.008
Virgil and I have been
over this so many times.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.877
- Yeah, we got this, man.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:23.011
Should be pretty easy,

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:23.945
in and out.

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:26.682
I'm ready to go.

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:30.152
- Virgil, any further
questions for Markus?

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:32.054
- No explanation needed,

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:34.389
which seems pretty fortunate.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.894
- All right, let's hit it.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:42.998
(gentle instrumental music)

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.101
(car engine running)

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:15.363
(electronic beeping)

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:26.441
(metal thudding)

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:46.828
(watch ticking)

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:21.830
(gun firing)

01:03:32.075 --> 01:03:36.011
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:40.315
(panting)

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.286
Fuck.

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:46.421
Fucking drive, drive.

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:47.489
(car engine running)

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.423
Fuck.

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:59.935
We just fucking went in there,

01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:01.102
and it was so fucking dark.

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:02.170
I swear to God, Markus.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.839
It was fucking pitch black,

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:06.441
and out of nowhere,
fucking Vernon's guys

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:09.945
just jumped in and
fucking shanked Virgil

01:04:09.947 --> 01:04:12.280
right in the fucking neck, man.

01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:13.348
I fucking shot at them,

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.482
and they fucking shot back,

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:16.284
and I just took the fuck off.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:18.486
I fucked up.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.122
I'm sorry.

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:23.992
I really fucked this up, man.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.927
Everything was where
you said it was,

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:29.130
the floor plan, the
cash, everything.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.900
It was just too fucking dark.

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.101
It was so fucking dark.

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:40.342
You can tell Frank that
it was all my fault.

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:41.543
I swear to God, Markus.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.278
Just tell him it was
all my fucking fault.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.613
Just fucking take
care of my kids

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:46.081
if something happens to me, man.

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.884
I'm fucking sorry.

01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:51.453
Markus, I'm fucking sorry, man.

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:58.994
Fuck.

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:00.895
(gentle instrumental music)

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:25.080
(metal creaking)

01:06:30.721 --> 01:06:33.288
Look, yo, I don't
know what to say, man.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:35.190
I'm sorry.

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:39.361
What are you gonna tell Frank?

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:42.597
- I'm not sure yet.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:44.199
- Well, you can tell him that
I fucked it all up, okay,

01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:45.233
'cause I did.

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:49.437
Your hands are clean on this.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:51.373
I'm not gonna hold
you to anything.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.074
I'll even help
you get the money.

01:06:53.076 --> 01:06:54.042
We had a deal.

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:57.212
- I'm gonna get Frank his
damn money, all right?

01:06:58.415 --> 01:06:59.714
That's between me and him,

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.584
but our business is done now.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.186
Who'd you fucking hire?

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:06.121
Was it strange?

01:07:06.757 --> 01:07:08.223
- Who, you mean Virgil?

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:10.325
Bro, I told you, man.

01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:12.193
I don't even know
that motherfucker.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:13.461
Nixon set me up with him.

01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:21.736
Look, if you change
your mind, call me.

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:29.244
Look, you know where
to find me, man.

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:32.747
All right?

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.128
(metal thudding)

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:49.798
(metal scraping)

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:56.071
(gentle instrumental music)

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:22.430
(electronic beeping)

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:25.233
(phone ringing)

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:37.712
- [Frank] Markus, do you
have what I'm looking for?

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:39.581
Please say you do.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.515
- No.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:42.617
- [Frank] What?

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.419
What do you mean no?

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:47.354
- One of my guys got killed.

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:48.490
We didn't get the money.

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:51.626
- [Frank] What the
hell do you mean

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.394
you didn't get the money?

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:55.330
That's not what I
wanna hear, Markus.

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:57.265
I told you I was
going out of town.

01:08:57.901 --> 01:08:59.200
I need that money now.

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:00.835
You fucking failed me, man.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:04.439
All right, listen.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:05.840
Don't go looking for the money.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:06.774
I'm gonna call you back

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:09.344
and tell you what to do next.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:10.912
Make sure you answer your phone.

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:11.845
Later.

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:23.658
- I got an idea who it is.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.792
There's only one person

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:26.661
who could have
sent for the money.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.595
He knows we've got
the money, Jimmy.

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:31.866
I got one of my guys
working on it right now.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:34.736
He's gonna get me everything
I need to know about this.

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.205
I will.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.175
I'll make a few
more phone calls,

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.542
and I'll get back to
you with more info.

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:47.715
(electronic beeping)

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:53.321
(phone ringing)

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:54.455
Hey, you got a second?

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.794
Someone knows about
our little secret

01:09:59.796 --> 01:10:02.197
with the job we did in
Vegas at the casino.

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:04.632
Yeah, that's right.

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:07.735
Well, I'm gonna
need your assistance

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:09.337
in helping me find
some addresses

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:10.772
and phone numbers of someone.

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:15.610
(gentle instrumental music)

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.394
(car engine running)

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:48.810
- When do you have to pay Frank?

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:52.680
- Now.

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:56.751
- I think you're insane.

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:00.755
You know Frank is
gonna come down on you

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.523
for not getting the cash.

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:09.664
- He'll get his money.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.267
- Frank cares nothing
about anyone else.

01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:14.769
He will do whatever it
takes to get what he wants.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:17.472
His reputation is
not the best here.

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:19.607
I don't know why you
continue to work with him.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:21.542
Now I'm sure that these
other guys' people

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:22.443
will come looking for you.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:24.479
Once they know he's dead

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:26.381
and find about Watts,

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:32.854
then Vernon's people
and the cops next.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.324
None of this you care about.

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:40.728
- No.

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:44.499
(gentle instrumental music)

01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:50.322
- Okay, Markus.

01:11:50.323 --> 01:11:51.606
It seems like you need
some time to think.

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:58.346
I'm gonna get going and
give you some space.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.494
(papers rustling)

01:13:21.131 --> 01:13:24.432
(car engine running)

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.617
- Edwin, listen, I
got a job for you.

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:43.951
I just got off the
phone with Vernon.

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:46.020
He's supposed to give
me five of 12 mil.

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:48.022
Now I'm gonna send
you and Markus

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:49.724
to go pick it up.

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:51.092
Once you have the money,

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:52.126
I want you to dump his ass

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:54.462
and bury him where I told you.

01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:56.197
Then you bring me my
money, understood?

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.084
All right.

01:14:00.085 --> 01:14:01.067
Meet me here when you're done.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:04.872
(gentle instrumental music)

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:33.000
This is real simple, Markus,

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:34.702
and I've been working on
this for quite some time,

01:14:34.704 --> 01:14:37.705
so don't fuck it up.

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:40.675
You're gonna deliver this
bag at 11 o'clock sharp.

01:14:40.677 --> 01:14:43.878
You're gonna meet up with
Clyde on Eighth and Alameda.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.046
You'll have the money,

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:48.716
and I put a little incentive
in this briefcase for you.

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:50.518
You can check it if you want,

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.619
but I know you trust me.

01:14:52.689 --> 01:14:53.921
Oh, and by the way,

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.190
Clyde's got some work coming up,

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:58.993
and I'm sure he's gonna
need a good driver like you.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:14:59.927
I put in a good work,

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:00.895
but you don't have to thank me.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:02.129
You can thank yourself.

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:05.800
After all, you're the
one doing all the work.

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:10.071
Do you have any
questions for me, Markus?

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:13.674
I didn't think so.

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:18.713
(watch ticking)

01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:22.517
(gentle instrumental music)

01:15:35.565 --> 01:15:38.232
(metal clicking)

01:15:55.285 --> 01:15:58.052
(phone chiming)

01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:15.903
(electronic beeping)

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.105
- [Zander] Markus, is Zander.

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:20.341
I just spoke to Nelson.

01:16:20.343 --> 01:16:22.343
He has information.

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:24.579
He is going to kill you.

01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:27.081
He's sending guy now
to take care of it

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.283
and use you for
getting his money.

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:31.652
Nelson told me everything.

01:16:31.654 --> 01:16:32.653
- What do you mean?

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:33.854
- [Zander] Trust me.

01:16:33.856 --> 01:16:35.923
Watch your back, Markus.

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:39.961
(electronic beeping)

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:43.764
(gentle instrumental music)

01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:48.135
(footsteps)

01:17:17.834 --> 01:17:18.766
- Markus.

01:17:21.938 --> 01:17:22.870
All right.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.072
Let's go.

01:17:32.115 --> 01:17:33.180
(metal thudding)

01:17:33.182 --> 01:17:34.348
(electronic beeping)

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:38.019
(car engine running)

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:41.822
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:01.502
(metal thudding)

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:04.805
(car engine running)

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:22.123
(electronic beeping)

01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:30.431
(metal scraping)

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:33.968
(grunting and coughing)

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.927
- [Frank] What the fuck
are you trying to tell me?

01:19:59.929 --> 01:20:00.795
You have my money,

01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:02.329
and you killed my guy?

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:03.864
Why would I get rid of you?

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:06.500
You're out of your fucking mind.

01:20:08.104 --> 01:20:10.070
Just bring my fucking
money, Markus.

01:20:11.574 --> 01:20:13.073
I'm done with you.

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:16.110
You better look over
your shoulder this time.

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:17.311
I know exactly where you live.

01:20:17.313 --> 01:20:18.979
You're a dead man.

01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:24.218
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.193
- [Watts] Yo, Markus, I just
listened to your message

01:22:13.195 --> 01:22:14.128
and saw your text.

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:16.263
Jesus, Markus, fucking Frank?

01:22:17.667 --> 01:22:18.699
Fuck, I had a
feeling he would try

01:22:18.701 --> 01:22:19.633
to pull some bullshit.

01:22:19.635 --> 01:22:20.567
Look, I'm sorry, man.

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.436
I'm sorry about all this.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:25.005
You have his money,
you said though, right?

01:22:25.007 --> 01:22:26.407
- [Markus] Yeah.

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:27.341
- [Watts] Well, what are
you gonna do with it?

01:22:27.343 --> 01:22:28.309
You gonna hand it over to him

01:22:28.311 --> 01:22:29.143
after he tried to do you dirty

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:30.177
with one of his guys?

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.513
- [Markus] I don't know.

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:34.432
- [Watts] Does he know we
were working on this together

01:22:34.433 --> 01:22:36.350
when he gave the job originally?

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:39.420
- [Markus] No, he shouldn't.

01:22:40.323 --> 01:22:42.022
- [Watts] Fucking Frank.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.491
I think I gave you a
head's up about him

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:46.961
a long time ago, if I
can remember correctly.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:49.163
- [Markus] Yeah.

01:22:51.067 --> 01:22:53.267
- [Watts] What about
my portion of the cash?

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:56.337
[Markus] I got your money.

01:22:56.339 --> 01:22:58.272
- [Watts] Good,
when can we meet?

01:23:00.676 --> 01:23:02.743
- [Markus] Let's
say half an hour.

01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:03.644
- [Watts] All right, real good.

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:04.578
I can do that.

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:06.046
Where do you want to meet at?

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:09.283
- [Markus] Sixth Street Bridge,

01:23:09.285 --> 01:23:10.985
same place we met there before.

01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:12.653
I'll drop your money.

01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:13.587
Then I gotta go.

01:23:14.457 --> 01:23:16.657
I don't want people tailing me.

01:23:16.659 --> 01:23:18.625
All your money will be in there.

01:23:18.627 --> 01:23:20.294
- [Watts] All
right, sounds good.

01:23:20.296 --> 01:23:22.162
You let me know what you
want to do with Frank

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:24.064
later over the phone.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:25.833
Maybe I can help you out

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.601
even though it's none
of my fucking business,

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:29.737
but let's meet there
in about half an hour.

01:23:29.739 --> 01:23:30.738
Anything else?

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:33.374
- [Markus] No.

01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:37.077
- [Watts] All right,
I'll see you there.

01:23:37.079 --> 01:23:39.646
(electronic beeping)

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:42.783
(car engine running)

01:23:47.757 --> 01:23:49.390
(gentle instrumental music)

01:23:49.392 --> 01:23:52.259
(paper rustling)

01:24:06.809 --> 01:24:09.476
(bag zipping)

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:21.822
(electronic beeping)

01:24:21.824 --> 01:24:24.625
(phone ringing)

01:24:30.433 --> 01:24:31.832
- [Woman] Markus?

01:24:31.834 --> 01:24:33.634
- [Markus] Yeah, look,

01:24:33.636 --> 01:24:35.769
I'm gonna be leaving
town for a while.

01:24:37.273 --> 01:24:39.273
I can't talk a lot
about it right now.

01:24:40.676 --> 01:24:42.376
I'll talk to you in a few days.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.456
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:25:17.513 --> 01:25:20.347
(metal thudding)

01:25:44.607 --> 01:25:47.774
(car engine running)

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.440
(electronic beeping)

01:26:53.442 --> 01:26:55.342
- [Frank] Hey, asshole,
answer your phone.

01:26:55.344 --> 01:26:58.212
I think I have something
you might want,

01:26:58.214 --> 01:26:59.279
your girl, Staci.

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:03.517
Oh, and I picked up some
of my money from your boy.

01:27:03.519 --> 01:27:04.451
Oh, don't worry.

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:05.819
You won't find much left of him.

01:27:06.922 --> 01:27:09.556
Give me a call as
soon as possible.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:10.524
You have something of mine,

01:27:10.526 --> 01:27:12.359
and I have something of yours.

01:27:12.361 --> 01:27:13.994
Call me so we can negotiate.

01:27:13.996 --> 01:27:15.362
Bye.

01:27:15.364 --> 01:27:17.698
(car engine running)

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.500
(phone ringing)

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:32.246
Thanks for calling me back.

01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:33.914
Glad you listened to my message.

01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:35.782
We need to meet up, Markus,

01:27:35.784 --> 01:27:37.317
sort all this out.

01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:38.285
Where's my money?

01:27:39.288 --> 01:27:40.254
- A safe place.

01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:42.956
- [Frank] Staci's
right here, man.

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:44.258
She's fine and in good health,

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:45.959
and I wanna keep it that way,

01:27:45.961 --> 01:27:47.628
as long as you do what I say.

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:50.998
- [Staci] Markus, are you there?

01:27:52.968 --> 01:27:53.900
- Things will be fine

01:27:53.902 --> 01:27:55.569
as long as you cooperate.

01:27:55.571 --> 01:27:57.971
I say we settle this
once and for all.

01:27:57.973 --> 01:28:00.707
I don't want things
to get out of hand.

01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:03.277
Meet me at Twins in
and hour and a half.

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:04.978
You be there with my money,

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:06.813
I release the girl.

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:09.383
See you then.

01:28:10.819 --> 01:28:13.387
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:28:13.389 --> 01:28:16.523
(car engine running)

01:28:50.793 --> 01:28:53.527
(electronic beeping)

01:28:53.529 --> 01:28:55.762
(metal thudding)

01:28:55.764 --> 01:28:57.764
(gentle instrumental music)

01:28:57.766 --> 01:29:00.767
(metal clattering)

01:29:26.795 --> 01:29:29.663
(metal thudding)

01:29:45.614 --> 01:29:47.147
I just delivered a message.

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:50.550
They're releasing Staci
on Anderson and Boyd

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:52.052
by the Fourth Street Bridge.

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:55.422
I never said she'd
be here with me.

01:30:00.162 --> 01:30:01.628
Now hand over the money.

01:30:06.935 --> 01:30:09.669
(bag thudding)

01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:15.675
(metal scraping)

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:17.878
(yelling)

01:30:28.157 --> 01:30:31.057
(metal thudding)

01:30:59.588 --> 01:31:01.855
(grunting)

01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:07.060
(gentle instrumental music)

01:33:47.889 --> 01:33:51.691
(upbeat instrumental music)
