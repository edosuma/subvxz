to the workers' demands?

the unions at all costs.

Are you unhappy, Soren?
What gave me away, sir?

16:28.408 --> 16:31.168
I don't know.
Your expression never changes.

16:31.328 --> 16:34.888
Do you even know how to smile?
Yes.

Good heavens.

17:10.608 --> 17:12.648
I thought you had to be
convicted of a crime

17:12.808 --> 17:14.408
before you lived
somewhere like this.

17:17.888 --> 17:19.448
It's not that bad.

Plus, we haven't seen
the rest of it yet.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.688
Apparently, this is the rest of it.

17:33.648 --> 17:35.048
Well, I like it.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.368
And I'll even let you
have first choice of the beds.

Alright, all my food's labelled,
so I'll know if you ate anything.

17:58.208 --> 18:03.488

Ah, now, this...this is the real
university life I was talking about.

18:22.488 --> 18:25.328
You see, here, we're just
two typical college students.

18:25.488 --> 18:26.928
Absolutely, sir.

to raucously cheer on

Ah, waitress, we'd like to see
some menus, please.

19:12.688 --> 19:15.768
I'm not a waitress, there are no menus,
and the kitchen's closed.

19:15.928 --> 19:18.368
Well, then what can you offer us?

19:19.968 --> 19:22.888
(POSHLY) I can offer you beer
and pretzel rods, my fine fellow,

19:23.048 --> 19:24.728

Yes. Yes, two of these. Two beers.

Very good.

Would you like another, sir?

Yes. I'll get these.
Thank you very much, sir.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.528
Hello again.
What can I get for you?

20:13.888 --> 20:15.408
I was hoping you could
recommend something better

20:15.568 --> 20:16.968
than what we've been drinking.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.728
Well, for the discerning
out-of-towner like yourself,

20:19.888 --> 20:21.648
I recommend Leinenkugel's.

20:21.808 --> 20:23.688
You can really taste
the extra 10 cents.

20:24.728 --> 20:26.528
Yes, by all means. Two, please.

20:39.168 --> 20:42.928
You know, if we were in Germany
right now, we'd be underground.

20:43.088 --> 20:45.968
What?
'Rathskeller', it means 'basement'.

20:46.128 --> 20:47.608
OK.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.968

than to flirt in German.

Oh, please proceed.

And 10% attendance.

of your supplies

22:59.008 --> 23:01.368
and the experiment
you will be conducting.

23:01.528 --> 23:04.368
Now, I want you to turn to
the person next to you

23:04.528 --> 23:05.888
and introduce yourself.

Congratulations, folks,

You forgot your supply list.

23:26.328 --> 23:27.168
Eddie. Right.

23:27.328 --> 23:28.768
This class is really important to me

23:28.928 --> 23:31.048
because I need this teacher
to get me into med school.

23:31.208 --> 23:33.048
And if I'm stuck with you
as my lab partner,

23:33.208 --> 23:35.488
I can't afford to have you
screw things up for me, OK?

23:35.648 --> 23:39.288
It's very important to me as well.
I love organic chemistry.

23:39.448 --> 23:42.008
For instance,
I've just recently discovered

23:42.168 --> 23:44.688
that large amounts of alcohol
mixed with a carbon-based life form

23:44.848 --> 23:47.368
causes the life form
to blurt out stupid things.

23:47.528 --> 23:51.168
So, well, apologies for the other night.
I was just having some fun.

23:51.328 --> 23:53.168
Right, of course you were.

23:53.328 --> 23:56.328
And I love being made to feel like
a brainless slut by some sloppy lush.

23:56.488 --> 23:57.608
Thanks.

23:57.768 --> 24:01.608
I have learned me to repent
the sin of disobedient opposition

24:01.768 --> 24:04.888
To you and your behest,
I am enjoined and beg your pardon.

24:06.608 --> 24:08.368
Is he drunk now?

24:08.528 --> 24:11.648

24:18.248 --> 24:20.528
Don't forget your half
of the supplies next time.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.928
You would think that after spraying
somebody with high-powered soda,

24:35.088 --> 24:36.688
he'd get the message to stay away.

24:36.848 --> 24:40.648
Well, I think he's pretty hot.

24:40.808 --> 24:42.808
Hot? Oh, my God, Beth,
he is so affected.

24:42.968 --> 24:48.088
He was quoting Shakespeare, like
some Shakespearean-duke-lord guy.

24:48.248 --> 24:49.888
I hate phonies like that.

24:50.048 --> 24:52.928
So are you saying you wouldn't
take him up to the stacks?

24:53.088 --> 24:56.528
OK, A ― going at it
in the dusty stacks of the library

24:56.688 --> 24:58.088
is fairly disgusting.

24:58.248 --> 25:00.768
And B ― you literally say that
about every hot guy.

25:00.928 --> 25:02.968
Oh, so you admit he's hot.

25:03.128 --> 25:04.728
OK, I'm done having
this conversation.

25:04.888 --> 25:06.768
I need to concentrate
on my applications.

who's always hanging around?

is monitoring temperature and flow,

the hydrochloric acid

into the separatory funnel.

Now...

25:28.208 --> 25:30.208
...carefully turn the stopcock

25:30.368 --> 25:35.568
to allow some of the solution
to flow into the round-bottom flask.

Good morning, miss.

26:04.208 --> 26:05.568
Would you care for some breakfast?

26:05.728 --> 26:08.168
I spent the last two hours
looking like an incompetent idiot

26:08.328 --> 26:09.888
because my lab partner
didn't show up.

26:10.048 --> 26:11.768
Oh. Was that this morning?
Yes!

26:11.928 --> 26:13.848
You know, I know
exactly who you are.

26:14.008 --> 26:14.928
You do?
You do?

26:15.088 --> 26:16.528
You're just a spoiled
little rich kid

26:16.688 --> 26:19.208
who sees college as a detour
on the way to an easy life.

26:19.368 --> 26:21.968
No character. No accomplishments.
Just a royal pain in the ass.

26:22.128 --> 26:24.048
You're completely wrong.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.848
See, unlike people
who are given everything,

26:27.008 --> 26:28.728
I have to earn what I get.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.368
But that is the beauty
of a meritocracy ―

26:30.528 --> 26:32.488
people rise and fall
based on how hard they work.

26:32.648 --> 26:34.088
Would you like some more
hollandaise, Eddie?

26:34.248 --> 26:35.568
No, that's very good. Thank you.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.208
You're making eggs Benedict?
Mm-hm.

26:37.368 --> 26:38.848
On a hotplate in a dorm room?

26:39.008 --> 26:40.568
Yes, just a typical
student breakfast.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.448
No, thank you.

What statue?

Someone as righteous as you must have

26:50.608 --> 26:52.128
some sort of statue of themselves
somewhere.

26:52.288 --> 26:54.328
There's a difference between
being righteous and being right.

26:54.488 --> 26:57.208
I happen to be right. Could you
please put a shirt on or something?

26:57.368 --> 27:00.248

you'll have to get used to naked men.

Dude! Dude, there's a chick
in our room!

27:03.888 --> 27:05.688
Just drop the class.
No.

27:05.848 --> 27:08.568
Well, then you'd better be there,
and you'd better be prepared.

didn't she?

27:19.848 --> 27:22.128
Yes, she did seem rather upset, sir.

27:22.288 --> 27:26.088
Though, regardless,
I don't see why you would care.

of pay cheque, aren't you?

but it doesn't mean crap to me.

experience, and you don't have any.

with the employment. Please.

who wanna work here.

Are you deliberately trying
to make my life miserable?

No, I'm simply manning
the delicatessen

in the event that one of my
fellow students wants a tasty sandwich.

Yeah. He came highly recommended.

By whom?
You.

What would you like?
I'll have a turkey sandwich.

Paige, I'm busy. Eddie's your boy.
You're in charge of him.

28:38.128 --> 28:40.728
Alright, it seems we're completely
out of turkey today.

28:40.888 --> 28:43.768
Dude, there's, like,
10 turkey things in there.

28:46.448 --> 28:48.328
Is this some sort of test?

28:48.488 --> 28:50.808
Did Johns Hopkins send you
to see if I can handle pressure?

28:50.968 --> 28:52.288
Because I'm starting to crack.

28:52.448 --> 28:54.928
Well, who's in charge of carving?
Use the slicer.

28:55.088 --> 28:56.288
What's that?

29:00.448 --> 29:02.088
You used me as a reference.

29:02.248 --> 29:04.048
Yes. Look, you were
the only one I knew.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.928
Despite what you think, I really do
need this job. I have no money.

29:07.088 --> 29:08.728
But you have a personal egg-poacher.

29:08.888 --> 29:11.008
No, no. He's just another student.

29:11.168 --> 29:13.488
Really? What's he studying?
How to be a 30-year-old junior?

29:18.608 --> 29:23.088
Look, Paige, you were right
about my parents back in Denmark.

29:23.248 --> 29:24.608
They are from a certain wealth.

29:24.768 --> 29:26.848
But what I've done
is I've cut myself off from them.

29:27.008 --> 29:29.408
Dude.
Yes, just one minute.

29:32.128 --> 29:36.608
Listen, Paige, I realise I've taken
advantage of you recently, and...

29:36.768 --> 29:38.248
But just give me a chance today,

29:38.408 --> 29:40.448
and if I cause any problems,
then I'll quit.

Right.

29:55.848 --> 29:57.448
OK.

30:06.248 --> 30:07.848
Slowly, slowly.
Right.

30:08.008 --> 30:09.448
Right.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.408
OK, nice and smooth.

30:20.808 --> 30:22.528

You did OK in there.

32:21.408 --> 32:23.048
You can't be serious, can you?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.728

I was wondering...wondering
if you would like to accompany me.

32:47.848 --> 32:49.928
(LAUGHS) Accompany you?

32:50.088 --> 32:51.768
Oh, right, yes.
How do you say it colloquially?

32:51.928 --> 32:52.848
Um...

32:53.008 --> 32:56.248
Yo, dog, there's a mad party
kicking at my crib,

roll down there with me.

That was just sad.
Don't ever do that again.

33:03.768 --> 33:05.448
Yes, I really hurt my finger.

33:06.448 --> 33:08.008
So would you like to come?

33:12.768 --> 33:15.688
I...I'm actually kind of busy.

33:19.408 --> 33:20.928
Oh, dear.

What?

33:24.688 --> 33:27.008
I believe you just
got rejected, sir.

a completely different calibre.

Soren, just because she isn't royalty
doesn't mean she's not important.

33:49.448 --> 33:53.608
The higher calibre
I was referring to, sir, was hers.

There might be.

I'm actually taking
a Shakespeare class myself and...

35:44.008 --> 35:46.568
I'm not struggling.
I'm actually being graded unfairly.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.928
But I was wondering,
since you seem to be...

35:49.088 --> 35:50.448
Well versed.

35:51.448 --> 35:52.288
Yeah.

35:52.448 --> 35:54.248
Well, I was hoping
maybe you could...

35:55.528 --> 35:57.888
No, I don't need help.
Oh, OK.

35:58.048 --> 36:00.728
Just sounded like you were
asking me for help, that's all.

Next, it's 'Hamlet', which is about
a whiny prince from Denmark.

with reality?

37:08.808 --> 37:10.208

Well, you're from Denmark.

Yes, I think we do.

Well, Beth read it,
and she said he's a total loser.

37:16.368 --> 37:19.208
Well, you can tell Beth that
the prince was young and scared

37:19.368 --> 37:21.888
and he didn't feel ready for
the hard choices he had to make.

37:22.048 --> 37:24.168
It's not easy facing
that kind of pressure.

37:28.848 --> 37:31.128

It's beautiful.

37:57.728 --> 37:59.568
It's gibberish.
I have no idea what he's saying.

37:59.728 --> 38:03.448
Well, he's saying
that love is magical

38:03.608 --> 38:05.848
and that it makes people
look at each other

38:06.008 --> 38:07.448
in an unspoilt way,
without judgment.

38:07.608 --> 38:08.968
Why doesn't he just say that?

38:09.128 --> 38:10.728
Why can't people just
say what they mean?

38:11.728 --> 38:13.568
Well, people rarely say
what they mean.

38:14.568 --> 38:16.688
That's the interesting part, is...

38:16.848 --> 38:19.568
...is what's going on
underneath the surface.

38:21.328 --> 38:23.128
See, take line 12.

38:24.568 --> 38:27.208
"The sun itself sees not
Till heaven clears."

38:27.368 --> 38:28.888
What does that mean to you?

38:30.248 --> 38:33.088
That the sun can't shine
when it's cloudy.

38:33.248 --> 38:35.648
No. You're being too literal.
See, don't just go for the obvious.

38:35.808 --> 38:38.368
See, all these words,
they have multiple meanings

38:38.528 --> 38:41.688
and you have to
explore the possibilities

38:41.848 --> 38:43.408
and then make your choice.

38:44.408 --> 38:47.168
See, like the word 'sun',
that could mean the actual sun

38:47.328 --> 38:49.688
or it can mean light.

38:49.848 --> 38:52.488
But then 'light' can mean
knowledge or reason.

38:52.648 --> 38:56.008
That could go on forever.
(LAUGHS) Yes. Yes, it could.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.528
But I think in this case
it means reason.

38:58.688 --> 39:02.968
And then 'heaven' may refer
to the pearly gates

39:03.128 --> 39:04.928
or it could mean a state of being,

39:05.088 --> 39:08.128
you know, like being happy
or in love.

39:11.888 --> 39:14.688
So now read it again,
taking in all the possibilities,

39:14.848 --> 39:17.848
and tell me what you think it means.

39:20.488 --> 39:23.808
"The sun itself sees not
Till heaven clears".

39:29.248 --> 39:32.928
I guess...it means
that love blinds you

39:33.088 --> 39:36.688
and when you're in love,
you can't think reasonably.

39:39.488 --> 39:41.088
Do you agree?

39:42.088 --> 39:43.568
Yeah.

39:47.808 --> 39:49.568

Yes, you too.

I can't believe you, Paige.

41:32.528 --> 41:34.328
You should've invited him
home with you.

41:34.488 --> 41:37.088
What? No. That would be so weird.

41:37.248 --> 41:39.728
Well, then you won't mind

41:39.888 --> 41:42.128
if I invite him
back to Milwaukee with me?

41:42.288 --> 41:45.328
No. No, of course not.
Why would I mind?

Hey, Eddie, since you don't
have any other plans,

41:51.608 --> 41:52.928
I was wondering if...

41:53.088 --> 41:56.368
You wanted to spend Thanksgiving
with me and my family?

41:57.928 --> 42:00.768

that's not for you to decide.

43:10.168 --> 43:11.608
Thank you. I was glad to be invited.

43:11.768 --> 43:13.528
Hi, Eddie. I'm Ben Morgan.
Ben, hello.

43:13.688 --> 43:17.688
Hey, hey, Doc Paige.
(LAUGHS) Farmer John Sausage.

43:17.848 --> 43:19.328
Ooh!
(LAUGHS)

43:19.488 --> 43:22.128
Hey.
Hey. Oh, Mike, you look great.

43:22.288 --> 43:25.408
Oh, well, you know, Kayla's got me
on Slim Fast, so I lost 15.

43:25.568 --> 43:27.768
He put five of it back on today
at Rocky Rococo's.

43:27.928 --> 43:28.928
Boys.

43:30.648 --> 43:33.368
Er, who's this guy?
This is Eddie.

43:33.528 --> 43:36.168
Eddie's an exchange student
from Denmark. He's just a friend.

43:36.328 --> 43:37.648
Hello.

43:37.808 --> 43:40.768
(LOUDLY) Welcome to our home.
Thank you.

43:40.928 --> 43:43.208
Mike, he speaks better English
than you do.

43:43.368 --> 43:46.168
Yeah, anyway...
Pops, we'll see you in the morning.

43:46.328 --> 43:48.888
Hey, we're watching you, Frenchy.

43:49.048 --> 43:51.168
Come on into the house.

43:52.168 --> 43:55.568
You can ignore the moron twins.
(LAUGHS) OK.

43:58.048 --> 43:59.808
This is it.

44:01.768 --> 44:04.168
Oh, you can put them right here.
Right.

44:04.328 --> 44:05.808
Thanks.

44:20.128 --> 44:21.968
(LAUGHS)

44:31.728 --> 44:33.368
What are all the pins for?

44:33.528 --> 44:35.528
The few red ones
are where I've been

44:35.688 --> 44:37.568
and all the green ones
are where I wanna go.

44:37.728 --> 44:40.568
Ecuador. El Salvador.

44:40.728 --> 44:44.008
(LAUGHS) They're not exactly
tourist destinations, are they?

44:44.168 --> 44:46.928
No, but they're all the places
that Doctors Without Borders

44:47.088 --> 44:49.448
brings good medical care
and vaccinations

44:49.608 --> 44:51.008
and clean drinking water.

44:51.168 --> 44:52.888
What?
Nothing.

44:53.048 --> 44:56.848
I just really never met someone
who makes me feel so intimidated.

44:57.008 --> 45:00.808
And believe me, I've met my fair share
of intimidating people.

45:00.968 --> 45:03.288
(LAUGHS) I'm not intimidating.
Look at me.

45:03.448 --> 45:06.408
Yes, well, you see,
that's pretty intimidating as well.

45:08.408 --> 45:11.128
Well, I'm not the only one with goals.
What do you wanna do?

45:11.288 --> 45:13.088
I don't really have any choice.

45:13.248 --> 45:16.448
I have to take over
the family business.

45:16.608 --> 45:19.768
No choice at all?
No.

45:19.928 --> 45:21.848
(SQUEAKS)
Careful, you're crushing Gus.

45:23.208 --> 45:24.528
Oh, Gus.

45:24.688 --> 45:27.168
Yes, Gus.
He's a very good watch-moose.

45:27.328 --> 45:29.528
Not once was I attacked
by a monster under my bed

45:29.688 --> 45:31.248
or something scary in the closet.

45:31.408 --> 45:32.768
Isn't that right, Gus?

45:32.928 --> 45:34.448
(DEEP VOICE) Yes, that's right.
(LAUGHS)

45:34.608 --> 45:36.288
Hello, Gus. Nice to meet you.

45:36.448 --> 45:38.368
Very pleased to meet you, as well.
(LAUGHS)

45:42.368 --> 45:43.688
I like you like this.

45:43.848 --> 45:45.928
Like what?

45:47.488 --> 45:49.008
I don't know. Just...just like this.

45:49.168 --> 45:50.808
Just Paige.

45:53.968 --> 45:56.808
Alright, Eddie, we got John's room
made up for you.

45:56.968 --> 45:58.968
It's just down the hall,
across from our room.

45:59.128 --> 46:02.768
We sleep with the door open.
Thanks, Dad.

46:02.928 --> 46:05.728
So, Eddie, would you like to see
how things work around here?

46:05.888 --> 46:07.328
Maybe help us out tomorrow?

46:07.488 --> 46:10.008
No, no, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

46:10.168 --> 46:12.768
Oh, why not?
Yes, why not?

46:14.408 --> 46:16.528
OK. You know what?
Go ahead and help out.

46:16.688 --> 46:18.128
I'm gonna enjoy this.

46:18.288 --> 46:20.448
Come on, let's get you settled in.

46:25.248 --> 46:28.088
Stop. Stop. Stop!

46:32.648 --> 46:33.488
Whoa!

46:33.648 --> 46:36.368
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!

46:38.768 --> 46:41.568
Whoa. This one nearly hit me.

46:41.728 --> 46:44.728
(SPEAKS INAUDIBLY)

47:03.928 --> 47:06.528
Looks pretty funny.
Haven't seen too many tractors, huh?

47:07.768 --> 47:09.728
Nicely done with the milking.

47:09.888 --> 47:12.248
Yeah, I think you got
a new best friend in Bessie.

47:12.408 --> 47:14.848
Whoo!
Hey, should we get some dinner?

47:15.008 --> 47:18.088
What are those?
They're lawn mowers.

47:18.248 --> 47:21.448
Lawn mowers. Really?
Yeah.

47:22.448 --> 47:24.368
Uh-uh-uh. Hey, hey.

47:24.528 --> 47:28.688
Actually, we race these.
It's a huge sport around here.

47:28.848 --> 47:30.768
Really?
Yeah.

47:30.928 --> 47:32.488
Do you mind if I have a look?

47:32.648 --> 47:34.248
No, be our guest.

47:34.408 --> 47:36.768
Take a look at this one.
This is my baby.

47:36.928 --> 47:38.248
Right.

47:38.408 --> 47:41.168
(LAUGHS)

47:47.608 --> 47:50.968
I just put a new flywheel in there.
Yes, I see.

47:51.128 --> 47:53.648
You know, no matter
how dirty he races, there's no way

47:53.808 --> 47:56.328
we're letting Keith Kopetsky take home
the trophy again this year.

47:56.488 --> 47:59.768
How fast do these things go?
Well, we clocked it at 52.

48:01.888 --> 48:03.688
I can make it faster.

48:03.848 --> 48:05.888
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

48:06.048 --> 48:07.488
OK. Come on. Let's go.
What?

48:07.648 --> 48:09.768
That's good.
What, you don't believe me?

48:09.928 --> 48:12.168
(LAUGHS)
I can.

48:12.328 --> 48:14.968
(ALL SPEAK AT ONCE)

48:15.128 --> 48:17.888
Might be a Thanksgiving pa, huh?
Yeah.

48:18.048 --> 48:19.488
(GASPS)
Are you OK?

48:19.648 --> 48:22.728
Oh, you had me going.
Not until after the pie, alright?

48:22.888 --> 48:24.928
Milk?

48:25.088 --> 48:27.728
Oh, no. I won't be drinking much milk
in the near future.

48:27.888 --> 48:29.488
(LAUGHTER)

48:29.648 --> 48:31.688
Ma, great turkey.
Don't eat too much.

48:31.848 --> 48:34.728
We got feeding to do, and I don't
need you boys in a turkey coma.

48:34.888 --> 48:36.808
Alright.
You've got more work?

48:36.968 --> 48:39.008
Yeah, 24 hours a day.
Really?

48:39.168 --> 48:40.008
Have to.

48:40.168 --> 48:42.488
If you don't milk them,
the cows' udders will explode.

48:44.568 --> 48:46.808
No.
It happened at Frank Monahan's.

48:46.968 --> 48:48.888
And did you actually
see it happen, Mikey?

48:49.048 --> 48:50.448
No.
You're so bad.

48:50.608 --> 48:53.248
You see, Eddie, we gotta work twice
as hard as corporate-owned farms

48:53.408 --> 48:54.768
just to stay afloat.

48:54.928 --> 48:57.208
At this rate, the family farm
will be extinct in 20 years.

48:57.368 --> 48:59.088
I don't think he needs
to hear that now.

48:59.248 --> 49:00.568
No, I'm interested.

49:00.728 --> 49:03.008
What the big boys need to understand
is that we're all interdependent.

49:03.168 --> 49:06.248
And if somebody loses,
eventually, we'll all lose.

49:08.288 --> 49:10.088
What?
Nothing.

49:10.248 --> 49:11.568
MIKE: Thanks, Dad.

49:11.728 --> 49:14.968
So, Eddie, what's up
with you and my sister, huh?

49:15.128 --> 49:18.368
Johnny!
Look, Paige, someone had to ask.

49:18.528 --> 49:20.928
Yeah, Paige, he's too good-looking.
Yeah.

49:21.088 --> 49:22.608
That's right, I said it.
You're too good-looking.

49:22.768 --> 49:24.488
I'm not that good-looking.
I'd say he's pretty good-looking.

49:24.648 --> 49:26.168
Yeah, yeah.
You're pretty good-looking.

49:26.328 --> 49:27.768
Oh, yeah.
Guys!

49:27.928 --> 49:29.928
If you combine that with the accent
and your Euro charm,

49:30.088 --> 49:31.408
you're a lethal combination.

49:31.568 --> 49:32.888
Would everyone just stop? Please.

49:33.048 --> 49:34.688
Paige, we don't even know this guy.

49:34.848 --> 49:36.448
I don't know anyone from Denmark.
No.

49:36.608 --> 49:37.968
I've never heard of anyone
from there.

49:38.128 --> 49:40.128
Have you?
Yeah, sure.

49:44.768 --> 49:46.288
Eddie?

49:47.408 --> 49:50.528
Um, Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr,
Hans Christian Andersen.

49:50.688 --> 49:52.328
Wow.

49:52.488 --> 49:54.648
(MUTTERS) Hans Christian Andersen?

49:56.248 --> 49:58.168
Um, Lars Ulrich.

49:58.328 --> 49:59.768
From Metallica?
From Metallica.

49:59.928 --> 50:00.848
Get out!
OK.

50:01.008 --> 50:04.408
And Helena Christensen.
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

50:04.568 --> 50:06.048
The Victoria's Secret model?
Yes.

50:06.208 --> 50:08.568
OK. That's gotta be the coolest
country in the world right now.

50:08.728 --> 50:10.488
Seriously, you should
be a superpower.

50:10.648 --> 50:12.928
(LAUGHTER)
Yes.

50:14.848 --> 50:16.488
MAN ON P.A.: Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen,

50:16.648 --> 50:18.768
to the Manitowoc County Fairgrounds.

50:18.928 --> 50:20.408
And a beautiful day for racing

50:20.568 --> 50:24.408
and the 10th annual
Mad Mower Derby!

50:24.568 --> 50:26.528
Give them a hand.
We got the seniors' class.

50:26.688 --> 50:29.208
We've got machines
up to 15 horsepower.

50:29.368 --> 50:30.888
They'll be blasting
by the grandstand here

50:31.048 --> 50:32.728
at a good 8 to 12 miles an hour.

50:32.888 --> 50:34.968
So hang onto your hats
when they come by, folks.

50:35.128 --> 50:37.728
Let them hear it
when they come past the stands here.

50:37.888 --> 50:41.168
Peterson's pulling out of the pit.
Look at him go around that corner.

50:41.328 --> 50:43.808
Come on. Come on!
(REVS ENGINE)

50:43.968 --> 50:46.528
Check it out. Kopetsky.

50:50.048 --> 50:52.168
Whoo!
(REVS ENGINE LOUDLY)

50:54.968 --> 50:56.448
What's up, Keith?

50:57.448 --> 50:59.408
What the hell did you do
to that thing?

51:00.608 --> 51:03.928
I bumped up the compression
and a few other little modifications.

51:04.088 --> 51:05.808
(REVS ENGINE)

51:05.968 --> 51:07.448
(REVS ENGINE)

51:12.288 --> 51:15.168
Alright. One lap to go, folks.
Let them hear it now.

51:15.328 --> 51:18.048
The last of the five laps here
in the senior class.

51:18.208 --> 51:21.648
Osterhouse is pushing.
Now Peterson's moving up.

51:21.808 --> 51:24.128
He's making his move. He's making
his move. Here he comes now.

51:24.288 --> 51:27.208
And here comes Thompson.
There goes Peterson!

51:27.368 --> 51:29.248
(CHEERING)
Go, Mr Peterson!

51:29.408 --> 51:32.608
Mr Peterson?
Oh, he's so daring.

51:37.888 --> 51:40.168
Your brothers seem to like him.
Mom.

51:40.328 --> 51:43.368
I like him too.
Yeah, I get that.

51:43.528 --> 51:46.408
I really can't afford
any distractions right now.

51:47.568 --> 51:50.248
Chemistry isn't just
in a class, kiddo.

51:51.448 --> 51:53.768
And you guys have it.
Right.

51:53.928 --> 51:57.088
Then what happens? I fool myself
into thinking he's Prince Charming?

51:57.248 --> 51:59.208
We get married
and live happily ever after?

51:59.368 --> 52:01.608
Then all my hard work
goes down the drain

52:01.768 --> 52:03.768
because I'm too busy
shopping for groceries

52:03.928 --> 52:05.728
and picking my kids up at soccer.

52:06.928 --> 52:11.048
Sweetie...it really wasn't
as bad as all that.

52:11.208 --> 52:14.368
I didn't mean it that way.
I know.

52:14.528 --> 52:16.888
But we're not talking about me.

52:17.928 --> 52:19.448
I made my choice.

52:21.328 --> 52:23.328
This is about you making
the right choice for you.

52:23.488 --> 52:26.728
MAN ON P.A.: OK, we're getting
ready for the super-modified class.

52:26.888 --> 52:29.608
OK, your brothers
are getting out there.

52:29.768 --> 52:31.448
We have a Le Mans-style start.

52:31.608 --> 52:33.568
The engines will be off.

52:33.728 --> 52:37.128
The drivers, on the gun, will be
running on foot across the track...

52:37.288 --> 52:38.768
Go, Eddie.
..onto the mowers.

52:38.928 --> 52:40.568
Start the mowers and start racing.

52:40.728 --> 52:43.928
Alright, this one's
for all the marbles.

52:44.088 --> 52:47.168
And they've set themselves up
in the line now.

52:47.328 --> 52:49.248
Boys, you've been waiting
all summer for this.

52:49.408 --> 52:51.568
They're getting ready here.
They're champing at the bit, folks.

52:51.728 --> 52:55.848
All set. Listen for the gun
to start it off.

52:56.008 --> 52:58.008
(LAUGHS)
Shut up.

52:58.168 --> 52:59.808
(BANG!)
And they're off. There they go.

52:59.968 --> 53:01.648
Oh, Williams and Kopetsky collide.
Get up!

53:01.808 --> 53:04.648
Williams is on the ground. Get out
of there before they run you over.

53:04.808 --> 53:07.328
They're firing the machines up now.
Number five is up.

53:07.488 --> 53:10.288
Number seven's up.
Kopetsky pulls right out.

53:12.008 --> 53:15.048
Looks like Williams is having
some trouble getting his engine going.

53:15.208 --> 53:16.848
And as they head
into the first turn,

53:17.008 --> 53:19.088
Kopetsky on number eight
is in the lead.

53:19.248 --> 53:22.288
(ENGINE REVS)

53:22.448 --> 53:25.008
Look at that.
Williams got it running.

53:25.168 --> 53:26.848
But he's got a long way to go.

53:28.088 --> 53:29.528
Go, go, go, go, go!

53:29.688 --> 53:31.248
It looks like the Morgan brothers

53:31.408 --> 53:32.848
are really challenging
Kopetsky there.

53:33.008 --> 53:34.448
They are chasing him down.

53:34.608 --> 53:36.768
Ride my tail.
Mike Morgan, on Moovover, second.

53:36.928 --> 53:39.728
And his brother, John,
on number seven, is right behind him.

53:39.888 --> 53:42.688
Williams now is on the track.
He's catching up.

53:42.848 --> 53:45.208
At the back of the pack,
he's starting to move up nicely.

53:45.368 --> 53:48.928
And he's putting on some real speed,
but he is way behind.

53:55.648 --> 53:58.808
And it looks like we've got a duel
shaping up in the front of the pack.

53:58.968 --> 54:01.288
Mike Morgan is really going
after Kopetsky.

54:01.448 --> 54:04.128
Eat it, Morgan!
Watch it!

54:04.288 --> 54:07.008
Morgan goes through
the hay bale there.

54:07.168 --> 54:09.528
It looks like he pushed him
right off the track.

54:09.688 --> 54:12.568
Damn it! God!
Keep it clean there, Kopetsky.

54:12.728 --> 54:14.328
John Morgan is moving up now

54:14.488 --> 54:17.408

away from Kopetsky.

Go!

on number nine.

54:23.728 --> 54:26.528

a three-way race, folks.

Go, go, go!
Get him!

54:28.168 --> 54:31.528
Kopetsky is trying
to hold him off now.

54:31.688 --> 54:33.288

is really out for the gold.

on the inside.

with some quick moves.

54:52.688 --> 54:55.648

He'll mess with you.

Destiny is not something
that you can fight against.

1:05:08.408 --> 1:05:10.848
But what about circumstance?
Take Othello, for instance.

1:05:11.008 --> 1:05:15.568
Was Othello fated to kill Desdemona,
or did lago create the circumstance?

1:05:15.728 --> 1:05:19.448
I think it's both. On the surface,
Iago is the bad guy.

1:05:19.608 --> 1:05:21.568
But if we look closer, we see that

1:05:21.728 --> 1:05:24.008
the crack lago exploited
was of Othello's own making.

1:05:24.168 --> 1:05:27.328
But still, Othello made choices.
Bad ones.

1:05:27.488 --> 1:05:31.048

not to listen to his heart.

1:05:32.688 --> 1:05:35.408

is a handsome prince?

1:09:51.328 --> 1:09:53.568
(MAN YELLS) Prince Edvard!

1:09:53.728 --> 1:09:56.048
Eddie! Eddie!
Edvard!

1:09:56.208 --> 1:09:58.048
Eddie!

1:10:01.128 --> 1:10:02.888
Eddie! Eddie!

1:10:03.048 --> 1:10:05.368
It's Paige Morgan!
Paige Morgan?

1:10:05.528 --> 1:10:07.248
Paige Morgan?
Paige Morgan.

1:10:07.408 --> 1:10:09.768
Look, there's Paige Morgan
from the newspaper!

1:10:09.928 --> 1:10:11.288
Hi.

1:10:11.448 --> 1:10:14.568
(CROWD CHANTS)
Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige!

1:10:14.728 --> 1:10:17.208
MAN: Eddie, it's Paige Morgan!
Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige!

1:10:17.368 --> 1:10:19.848
Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige!
Paige Morgan!

1:10:20.008 --> 1:10:22.728
Paige Morgan!
Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige! Paige!

1:10:22.888 --> 1:10:24.728
Eddie! Eddie!

1:10:29.528 --> 1:10:32.528
(CROWD CHEERS)
Yah!

1:10:48.288 --> 1:10:51.288
(CROWD CHEERS)

1:11:13.608 --> 1:11:16.608
(LOUD CHEERING)

1:11:35.128 --> 1:11:39.768
MAN: His Royal Highness
the Crown Prince and a...guest.

1:11:45.248 --> 1:11:47.528
Just wait here.
(PANTS) OK.

1:11:51.648 --> 1:11:53.128
Hi.

1:11:58.608 --> 1:12:02.248
I now proclaim this session
of Parliament open.

1:12:02.408 --> 1:12:05.128
(APPLAUSE)

1:12:05.288 --> 1:12:07.248
(MUTTERS) Right, let's go.

1:12:14.128 --> 1:12:15.968
Oh, no.
What?

1:12:16.128 --> 1:12:18.048
You didn't tell me
you lived with your parents.

1:12:35.528 --> 1:12:37.928
Hi.
My word!

1:12:38.088 --> 1:12:40.248
Miss Paige.
Oh! Soren!

1:12:40.408 --> 1:12:42.488
Oh, hugging the help?

1:12:42.648 --> 1:12:44.888
You're gonna fit in
very well around here.

1:12:45.048 --> 1:12:50.488
Right. I will see you in a moment
and Soren will show you where to go.

1:12:55.168 --> 1:12:57.128
May I?
Absolutely.

1:12:57.288 --> 1:12:59.248
My pleasure.

1:13:01.848 --> 1:13:04.048
This is the south courtyard.

1:13:04.208 --> 1:13:07.128
You, of course,
came through the private gate.

1:13:07.288 --> 1:13:09.208
Hi.
Miss Paige.

1:13:09.368 --> 1:13:11.248
Right. Hi.

1:13:11.408 --> 1:13:14.048
(GASPS)
This is where we keep the mops.

1:13:14.208 --> 1:13:16.288
Absolutely not!
I love her and she loves me.

1:13:16.448 --> 1:13:18.168
And we will do as we please.
Oh, love.

1:13:18.328 --> 1:13:19.808
And <i>when</i> has it ever
been about that?

1:13:19.968 --> 1:13:22.448
Mother, it has taken us a lot
to get where we are today.

1:13:22.608 --> 1:13:24.048
All we want is to be together.

1:13:24.208 --> 1:13:26.488
It has taken you a lot
to get to where you are?

1:13:26.648 --> 1:13:30.088
It has taken us 1,200 years
to get to where we are.

1:13:30.248 --> 1:13:32.888
In a few weeks time,
you will ascend the throne as king,

1:13:33.048 --> 1:13:35.568
and I will let nothing
stand in the way of that.

1:13:35.728 --> 1:13:38.128
Certainly not some
tawdry little affair

1:13:38.288 --> 1:13:40.128
with a gold-digging American girl

1:13:40.288 --> 1:13:42.888
who dreams of becoming
the next Princess Di.

1:13:43.048 --> 1:13:45.768
Mother, you cannot tell me
whom to love and how to live my life.

1:13:45.928 --> 1:13:50.088
Edvard, I am sure
she has outstanding qualities.

1:13:50.248 --> 1:13:54.088
But once the news of your father's
illness becomes public,

1:13:54.248 --> 1:13:56.968
the people will
require reassurance.

1:13:57.128 --> 1:13:59.008
Yes, and I will proudly
and confidently ascend the throne.

1:13:59.168 --> 1:14:00.768
Good.

1:14:00.928 --> 1:14:03.048
As soon as you allow me
to choose my own bride.

1:14:03.208 --> 1:14:04.528
Out of the question.

1:14:04.688 --> 1:14:06.368
She is a commoner.

1:14:06.528 --> 1:14:09.928
Well, then I hope you think
that Arabella is fit to be the queen

1:14:10.088 --> 1:14:12.288
at the age of 12.

1:14:12.448 --> 1:14:14.448
Oh, no, I'm forgetting.
I'm forgetting about Nestor.

1:14:14.608 --> 1:14:15.928
Oh, don't threaten us!

1:14:16.088 --> 1:14:18.208
Cousin Bartholomew's
idiot son, Nestor,

1:14:18.368 --> 1:14:20.928
the 47-year-old virgin in diapers.

1:14:21.088 --> 1:14:23.128
Oh, the people will rejoice.
Enough!

1:14:24.248 --> 1:14:26.728
Edvard, you will be
the next king of Denmark.

1:14:26.888 --> 1:14:29.008
Do you hear me?
Yes, sir.

1:14:31.888 --> 1:14:33.728
Now, about your young lady.

1:14:33.888 --> 1:14:36.008
If you say you love her as you do,

1:14:36.168 --> 1:14:39.808
and you believe she will
make you happy, then marry her.

1:14:41.128 --> 1:14:42.888
Haraald, you can't mean that.

1:14:43.048 --> 1:14:45.288
Maybe this is not a good time
to discuss...

1:14:45.448 --> 1:14:47.008
No, it's a perfect time.

1:14:47.168 --> 1:14:50.568
It is at the end of a man's life
when he realises

1:14:50.728 --> 1:14:53.528
how important his decisions were
at the beginning.

1:14:57.408 --> 1:15:01.728
And in 1502, King Gustav IV fell,
hit his head on a rock,

1:15:01.888 --> 1:15:04.008
had his famous moment
of enlightenment.

1:15:04.168 --> 1:15:07.088
Claimed that he saw God
at the bottom of this lake.

1:15:07.248 --> 1:15:10.288
He went charging off through
the castle to tell everyone.

1:15:10.448 --> 1:15:12.768
Unfortunately,
he was carrying a torch.

1:15:12.928 --> 1:15:15.288
Curtains caught fire,
burnt down half the palace.

1:15:15.448 --> 1:15:17.408
Thus, observe the new wing.

1:15:17.568 --> 1:15:21.328
He takes great pleasure
in twisting my ancestors' history.

1:15:23.208 --> 1:15:24.688
(LAUGHS)

1:15:29.728 --> 1:15:32.728
Today has been the most
incredible day of my life.

1:15:34.888 --> 1:15:36.528
Come with me.

1:15:40.528 --> 1:15:44.208
I have something important
to tell you.

1:15:44.368 --> 1:15:45.688
Yeah?

1:15:45.848 --> 1:15:48.728
The reason I had to come back

1:15:48.888 --> 1:15:52.648
is because my father has
decided to pass the crown to me.

1:15:52.808 --> 1:15:55.568
So you're gonna be king?

1:15:56.568 --> 1:15:57.568
Yes.

1:16:02.448 --> 1:16:04.688
I love you so much.

1:16:04.848 --> 1:16:07.688
And I know the sacrifices
you would have to make.

1:16:11.248 --> 1:16:12.888
What are you doing?

1:16:20.808 --> 1:16:24.528
Paige Morgan, will you marry me?

1:16:24.688 --> 1:16:26.168
(GASPS)

1:16:30.368 --> 1:16:31.368
Yes!

1:17:33.448 --> 1:17:35.168
Oh, good morning.

1:17:35.328 --> 1:17:37.368
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning, ma'am.

1:17:40.728 --> 1:17:41.568
Coffee?

1:17:41.728 --> 1:17:44.848
Oh, I can get it myself
if you show me where the kitchen is.

1:17:45.008 --> 1:17:46.688
Or a Starbucks?

1:17:51.968 --> 1:17:55.408
Grande decaf non-fat latte?
Yes, ma'am.

1:17:57.688 --> 1:17:59.448
Congratulations!

1:17:59.608 --> 1:18:02.168
You and Edvard getting married!
It's so romantic!

1:18:02.328 --> 1:18:05.008
You must be Arabella.
Call me Ari.

1:18:05.168 --> 1:18:07.288
Isn't it wonderful?
We're gonna be sisters.

1:18:10.488 --> 1:18:12.048
More hugging?

1:18:12.208 --> 1:18:14.328
Whatever will we do with you?
Thank you.

1:18:14.488 --> 1:18:17.048
Well, then, I thought we might
run through your schedule for the day.

1:18:17.208 --> 1:18:21.408
I have a schedule?
As of this morning you do.

1:18:21.568 --> 1:18:23.288
Come on.

1:18:23.448 --> 1:18:26.408
At 9:00, you have a groundbreaking
with Edvard.

1:18:26.568 --> 1:18:29.008
Also attending
will be Countess Yungen.

1:18:29.168 --> 1:18:31.808
Remember, if you're facing her,
the good eye is the left one.

1:18:31.968 --> 1:18:34.128
At 10:15, there's
a photo opportunity,

1:18:34.288 --> 1:18:37.208
holding hands with Edvard
on the royal yacht.

1:18:37.368 --> 1:18:40.248
Opening of a Miró exhibit
at the museum at noon.

1:18:40.408 --> 1:18:43.088
12:40 is when you can
call your parents.

1:18:43.248 --> 1:18:45.448
Yes, a 1:00 luncheon
with the Queen.

1:18:45.608 --> 1:18:46.808
(GASPS)

1:18:46.968 --> 1:18:50.808
(BREATHES DEEPLY) Deep breaths.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

1:18:50.968 --> 1:18:52.568
You'll get through this
in spectacular fashion.

1:18:52.728 --> 1:18:56.488
After all, that's what the people
expect of our future queen.

1:18:56.648 --> 1:18:58.608
Oh, my God.

1:18:58.768 --> 1:19:00.248
What?

1:19:01.328 --> 1:19:02.648
Queen.

1:19:02.808 --> 1:19:04.448
I mean, I knew it worked that way,

1:19:04.608 --> 1:19:06.448
but I hadn't really
thought about it like that.

1:19:06.608 --> 1:19:09.928
Do you think that people are gonna mind
if I'm gonna be their queen

1:19:10.088 --> 1:19:11.568
and all I've seen is the airport?

1:19:11.728 --> 1:19:13.928
No.
Uh-uh.

1:19:15.688 --> 1:19:16.728
Anna.

1:19:18.128 --> 1:19:20.288
Do you a have dress
for Eddie's coronation ball yet?

1:19:20.448 --> 1:19:22.448
Um, no.

1:19:22.608 --> 1:19:24.248
You may come in now.

1:19:24.408 --> 1:19:28.088
This is Margueritte.
She can design anything you like.

1:19:28.248 --> 1:19:30.928
Chanel, Dior, Armani, Prada.

1:19:31.088 --> 1:19:33.728
It's very nice to meet you.
Turn.

1:19:33.888 --> 1:19:36.448
Excuse me?
Turn.

1:19:37.848 --> 1:19:39.368
Come, ladies.

1:19:41.088 --> 1:19:42.728
Long torso.

1:19:42.888 --> 1:19:44.488
Good figure.

1:19:45.728 --> 1:19:47.448
Terrible American posture.

1:19:49.808 --> 1:19:51.568
I don't work with hunchbacks.

1:19:52.608 --> 1:19:54.888
When is the wedding, Miss Morgan?
Good morning.

1:19:56.008 --> 1:19:57.808
When these plants are completed,

1:19:57.968 --> 1:20:00.128
Denmark will lead
the European community

1:20:00.288 --> 1:20:03.488
in vegetable oil
and specialty fat production.

1:20:18.608 --> 1:20:21.528
(LAUGHTER)

1:20:21.688 --> 1:20:24.688
Farm girl.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

1:20:33.528 --> 1:20:36.208
So where do the future king and queen
go on their honeymoon?

1:20:36.368 --> 1:20:38.048
I was thinking Morocco.

1:20:38.208 --> 1:20:40.408
It's really hard
to organise security there.

1:20:40.568 --> 1:20:42.048
Oh, right, OK.

1:20:42.208 --> 1:20:44.808
What about Spain?
Mmm. Yes, Spain is good.

1:20:44.968 --> 1:20:47.808
I'm sure King Juan Carlos won't
mind lending us his private island

1:20:47.968 --> 1:20:50.208
for a few weeks in the summer.

1:20:57.728 --> 1:20:59.688
Well, it's hanging well
in the front.

1:20:59.848 --> 1:21:01.368
Is this part supposed to be loose?

1:21:01.528 --> 1:21:03.328
She doesn't speak.
At all?

1:21:03.488 --> 1:21:05.208
To you.
Oh.

1:21:05.368 --> 1:21:07.448
Well, is this part
supposed to be loose?

1:21:07.608 --> 1:21:10.128
Well, it has been worn that way
for the past 200 years.

1:21:13.448 --> 1:21:16.448
(STATELY MUSIC)

1:21:19.488 --> 1:21:22.488
(SPEAKS INAUDIBLY)

1:21:36.928 --> 1:21:41.488
The opening of this new wing
of the Dangård Paediatric Hospital...

1:21:41.648 --> 1:21:43.968
(WHISPERS) Where's Paige?
I don't know.

1:21:44.128 --> 1:21:46.728
...our country's commitment
to improving healthcare

1:21:46.888 --> 1:21:48.528
for all of our people.

1:21:50.448 --> 1:21:52.048
(WHISPERS) There she is.

1:21:56.968 --> 1:21:59.408
I was just being nice to some kids.

1:21:59.568 --> 1:22:02.168
Which every paper
felt compelled to report.

1:22:02.328 --> 1:22:04.888
Well, what's wrong with that?

1:22:05.048 --> 1:22:07.648
That you did it in
a new, state-of-the-art,

1:22:07.808 --> 1:22:11.368
government-funded,
billion-kroner hospital,

1:22:11.528 --> 1:22:14.368
which suddenly all these newspapers
have no interest in mentioning.

1:22:14.528 --> 1:22:16.048
Oh.

1:22:16.208 --> 1:22:19.848
We had an opportunity
on the eve of a national strike,

1:22:20.008 --> 1:22:22.728
to show the people what their
healthcare system can do for them.

1:22:22.888 --> 1:22:25.248
Instead, all they know
is that you are nice to children.

1:22:25.408 --> 1:22:26.848
I'm sorry. I'm trying.

1:22:27.008 --> 1:22:29.568
It's gonna take me a while
to get the hang of things.

1:22:29.728 --> 1:22:33.048
Being royal is not like
being famous or being rich.

1:22:33.208 --> 1:22:35.128
It is something much, much more.

1:22:35.288 --> 1:22:39.288
It is a way of being that can
only be learned from birth.

1:22:39.448 --> 1:22:42.408
It is...an embodiment

1:22:42.568 --> 1:22:46.768
which requires you to sacrifice
who you are for who you must be.

1:22:46.928 --> 1:22:51.288
Well, I'm Paige Morgan
from Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

1:22:51.448 --> 1:22:53.528
Paige Morgan can no longer exist.

1:22:53.688 --> 1:22:55.128
She is gone.

1:22:55.288 --> 1:22:59.408
You are now
the future queen of Denmark...

1:23:00.528 --> 1:23:02.008
...plain and simple.

1:23:10.288 --> 1:23:11.968
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

1:23:12.128 --> 1:23:14.888
Your Royal Highness,
it's time to leave.

1:23:15.048 --> 1:23:17.128
Alright. Thank you, Soren. Thank you.

1:23:29.568 --> 1:23:31.408
His Royal Highness
the Crown Prince.

1:23:31.568 --> 1:23:33.048
Royal Highness.
Prime Minister.

1:23:33.208 --> 1:23:35.608
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1:23:35.768 --> 1:23:37.368
In the interest of expedience,

1:23:37.528 --> 1:23:39.808
I've asked the lead negotiator
for the national unions

1:23:39.968 --> 1:23:42.088
and the lead negotiator
for our nation's corporate interests

1:23:42.248 --> 1:23:44.168
to join us.

1:23:44.328 --> 1:23:46.248
How do you do?
I'm very pleased to meet you.

1:23:46.408 --> 1:23:48.008
Nice to meet you again.

1:23:49.168 --> 1:23:50.648
Your Royal Highness.

1:23:50.808 --> 1:23:53.008
I know your exposure
to these proceedings

1:23:53.168 --> 1:23:54.648
has been rather limited...

1:23:54.808 --> 1:23:56.408
Mr Anderson, I'm well aware

1:23:56.568 --> 1:23:58.368
of the traditions and the protocols
of this chamber,

1:23:58.528 --> 1:24:00.008
and while I respect them,

1:24:00.168 --> 1:24:02.328
we only have six hours
before all hell breaks loose.

1:24:02.488 --> 1:24:05.448
So don't you think the time
for gamesmanship has passed?

1:24:05.608 --> 1:24:08.048
Yes, sir.
Then we are in agreement.

1:24:08.208 --> 1:24:09.848
Please be seated.

1:24:11.528 --> 1:24:13.208
And get comfortable,

1:24:13.368 --> 1:24:15.848
because we're not leaving here
until this is solved.

1:24:19.088 --> 1:24:20.928
And where will this
additional money come from?

1:24:21.088 --> 1:24:23.128
Well, perhaps management
will tighten their belts.

1:24:23.288 --> 1:24:24.648
Our belts?
Yes!

1:24:24.808 --> 1:24:26.528
It might do you some good
to go without.

1:24:26.688 --> 1:24:28.128
These are businesses, not charities.

1:24:28.288 --> 1:24:30.688
Look, gentlemen, if we can't come to
a resolution about wages,

1:24:30.848 --> 1:24:32.448
perhaps we can discuss
concessions on benefits.

1:24:32.608 --> 1:24:33.808
No concessions!

1:24:33.968 --> 1:24:36.368
You take and take
and will give nothing in return!

1:24:36.528 --> 1:24:37.648
You are impossible!

1:24:37.808 --> 1:24:39.928
Gentlemen, please.
Let's remember this is not about us.

1:24:45.008 --> 1:24:47.688
You know, when I was in America,

1:24:47.848 --> 1:24:50.408
I spent some time
with Paige's family on her farm.

1:24:50.568 --> 1:24:51.528
(SIGHS)

1:24:51.688 --> 1:24:55.208
And they explained something to me --
that we are all interdependent.

1:24:56.248 --> 1:24:57.968
So we had better start caring
for our opposition

1:24:58.128 --> 1:24:59.688
as much as we do for ourselves.

1:25:02.208 --> 1:25:03.848
I wonder if anyone
on this table knows

1:25:04.008 --> 1:25:05.928
what it's like to work
for a tiny wage.

1:25:06.088 --> 1:25:10.008
And then to see that wage get
sliced up even further by taxes.

1:25:10.168 --> 1:25:12.888
Now, I can tell you from experience,
it can be a mighty struggle.

1:25:13.048 --> 1:25:16.528
But then I suspect it would be
substantially more difficult

1:25:16.688 --> 1:25:21.848
to see your job and your benefits
disappear altogether.

1:25:22.008 --> 1:25:26.248
Now, at the moment, we are 6% apart.
Correct?

1:25:26.408 --> 1:25:29.608
Now, if the goal is
to let the workers keep more

1:25:29.768 --> 1:25:31.248
without damaging the corporation,

1:25:31.408 --> 1:25:34.088
then perhaps there is
a third path to consider.

1:25:35.568 --> 1:25:37.048
He was brilliant.

1:25:37.208 --> 1:25:38.648
He got the unions
to lower their demands,

1:25:38.808 --> 1:25:40.208
the corporations
to raise their offer,

1:25:40.368 --> 1:25:43.128
and Parliament to cut the workers'
wage tax to make up the difference.

1:25:43.288 --> 1:25:44.608
Now, that's impressive.

1:25:44.768 --> 1:25:46.168
OK, about the dress.

1:25:46.328 --> 1:25:48.728
Am I supposed to be able to breathe?
No.

1:25:48.888 --> 1:25:50.528
Oh, well, then it's perfect.

1:25:50.688 --> 1:25:54.408
Miss Paige, the Queen would
like to see you immediately.

1:25:56.208 --> 1:25:59.048
Don't worry. I'll be by your side
the entire time.

1:26:10.568 --> 1:26:13.048
Soren, get out.
Yes, Your Majesty.

1:26:14.088 --> 1:26:15.568
Thanks.

1:26:32.048 --> 1:26:35.528
I know you think I don't like you.
Uh...

1:26:41.008 --> 1:26:43.088
I like traditions.

1:26:44.208 --> 1:26:48.808
I like traditions, and I like
consistency and continuity,

1:26:48.968 --> 1:26:51.168
and I don't like change.

1:26:52.968 --> 1:26:56.968
But...when that change
is for the better...

1:26:58.728 --> 1:27:01.648
...when it helps turn a boy
into a man,

1:27:01.808 --> 1:27:04.408
then I have to reconsider.

1:27:07.048 --> 1:27:10.488
Two weeks ago, I thought you were
the end of the monarchy.

1:27:12.248 --> 1:27:15.248
Now I see you may be the best thing
that ever happened to us.

1:27:17.128 --> 1:27:18.608

to the coronation ball?

but I've requested our song.
