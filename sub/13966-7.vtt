01:09.778 --> 01:12.573
<i>I know now why they call you Lotus.</i>

01:12.656 --> 01:16.201
You are... like a flower,
coming to bloom.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.417
Teach me the Wudang Crane technique.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.796
I am no teacher.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.049
Merely a disciple.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.715
It is lost.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.425
Where is Li Jinbao?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.803
Alone, guarding the East Gate.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.278
Li Jinbao!

03:06.561 --> 03:07.813
Li Jinbao.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.460
Lotus.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.005
You live.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.854
Run!

06:50.953 --> 06:52.955
One survivor, we agreed.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.415
One survivor to spread word
of Kublai's treachery.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.043
Was that not the plan?

07:04.341 --> 07:05.717
You don't look well.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.055
Should we ride for home?

07:11.389 --> 07:12.807
Continue as planned.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.892
And, Orus...

07:16.061 --> 07:17.812
indulge yourself.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.403
False flags, masks!

07:25.487 --> 07:27.822
These are the tools of cowards.

07:27.905 --> 07:31.576
Let's end this foolishness,
save our arrows for truer enemies.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.830
If you're coming, put it on.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.100
<i>I awoke some time later.</i>

07:55.183 --> 08:00.397
<i>Hours, days.
It might as well have been an eternity.</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:05.318
<i>Everything I once lived for,
everyone I knew...</i>

08:06.569 --> 08:07.695
<i>gone.</i>

08:08.863 --> 08:12.367
<i>I turned to the only sanctuary
I had left...</i>

08:13.451 --> 08:14.869
<i>within.</i>

08:36.224 --> 08:38.226
<i>Until the day the grief...</i>

08:38.309 --> 08:39.811
<i>the emptiness were complete.</i>

08:46.651 --> 08:49.904
<i>Those souls who perished
that day at the Wudang temple</i>

08:50.322 --> 08:52.365
<i>would not do so in vain.</i>

09:03.210 --> 09:06.213
<i>I pledged my services to the chancellor.</i>

09:06.296 --> 09:12.094
<i>He entrusted me, handmaiden...
guardian to the young Emperor.</i>

09:22.812 --> 09:24.689
<i>And in this task...</i>

09:27.650 --> 09:29.111
<i>I failed.</i>

09:33.198 --> 09:36.951
I could feel you, watching me...

09:37.034 --> 09:39.579
following me,
that day in my training hall.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.457
Why did you wait?

09:44.501 --> 09:48.546
I was hoping to see
some trace of the man I once loved.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.048
And did you?

10:08.941 --> 10:10.527
More for Chuleb. More!

10:13.196 --> 10:14.406
A very full visit!

10:14.489 --> 10:16.491
Mmm.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.826
We're honored that you could all make it.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.913
And an honor to return home and sleep.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.378
Further, we look forward
to doing this more often.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.047
We shouldn't be brought together
by politics alone.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.132
Mmm, agreed.

10:32.215 --> 10:35.927
We would be overwhelmed if the Khan
would travel to us on occasion.

10:36.010 --> 10:40.515
And, no, our hunts are not as lavish,
but they bring home meat.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.850
Mmm. The hunt.

10:42.934 --> 10:47.564
Our sacred duty to provide for our wives,
our children, our people.

10:47.647 --> 10:52.319
It is appropriate that our hunt
seal our partnership moving forward.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.612
Mongolia has slain a mighty beast.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.782
And there are many more to come.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.619
We are coming!

11:03.621 --> 11:08.168
Great Khan, your dreams of world conquest
are already well known to us.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.836
All of us.

11:09.919 --> 11:14.257
We respect the invitation,
your generosity of wine and women.

11:15.842 --> 11:19.095
This is only the beginning
of a conversation.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.681
No partnership has been sealed.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.358
Conversation?

11:32.817 --> 11:35.320
No, there's nothing else
to talk about any longer.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.908
The differences between myself,
my opponent are clear.

11:40.992 --> 11:44.329
You have to decide.
Do you back him or do you back Tengri?

11:46.581 --> 11:51.085
Lord Khan...
do you confuse yourself with God?

11:57.967 --> 12:00.219
Conquering the world
is not my wish.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.432
The world I simply inherited from Genghis.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.225
This decree, this mandate...

12:06.309 --> 12:09.479
is from nowhere else
but from Heaven above.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.482
It is the will of Tengri...

12:12.565 --> 12:14.484
the Eternal Blue Sky.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.780
And by whose will...

12:18.863 --> 12:21.574
was our sacred capital moved

12:21.658 --> 12:25.287
from Karakorum to the Chinese plains?

12:29.582 --> 12:33.002
Of which Chinese capital
do you refer, Arban?

12:34.337 --> 12:36.255
I built two.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.342
You weren't going to say goodbye?

13:23.511 --> 13:25.680
I said goodbye the night we met.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.060
Thank you.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.734
Some plead, some barter.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.988
No man has ever thanked me before.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.200
Very genteel.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.082
This time I've had with you...

13:53.165 --> 13:56.127
I haven't had to think or choose.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.590
It's the most free I've ever been.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.469
I told you, you would fall in love.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.682
No offense, but...

14:10.808 --> 14:12.143
I haven't.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.354
Not with me.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.401
And now, my leaving
has made you think again.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.986
Do you want to come with me?

14:22.069 --> 14:23.363
I can't leave.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.532
Can't?

14:26.533 --> 14:30.912
This, coming from the man who has
traveled the world since he was 16.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.457
Must be hard.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.550
Small price to pay
for the life I lead with the Khan.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.846
Lie to me.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.599
Lie to those around you.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.352
Don't lie to yourself.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.732
It's been fun.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.444
Thank you.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.555
You slept well, Princess?

15:32.056 --> 15:33.224
Yes, Mother.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.894
And without the bother of dreams.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.563
Then, you feel better this morning?

15:38.646 --> 15:41.816
I feel quite myself again.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.610
Wonderful news.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.991
Where are my handmaidens this morning?

15:50.908 --> 15:53.536
And where is Za Bing?

15:55.663 --> 15:58.541
From now on, I will tend to your needs.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.753
- You?
- Yes, daughter.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.507
But... why?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.180
No handmaidens...

16:14.098 --> 16:17.101
no meddling eunuchs, no visitors.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.022
Only your mother to tend
to your every need.

16:21.939 --> 16:25.234
Rest, child.
I'll return with the afternoon meal.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.740
I'm not locked up.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.080
She loves me like a daughter.
Don't you see?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.337
I may come and go as I please.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.888
Our chancellor.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.181
Our emperor.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.560
Do you feel no shame?

16:58.643 --> 17:01.646
Do you find no tragedy in their deaths?

17:01.729 --> 17:04.648
I find any loss of life tragic.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.362
Including my own, the day you died.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.409
You asked if I see in you the man I loved.

17:16.661 --> 17:17.829
I do not.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.455
I see a traitor...

17:20.540 --> 17:23.500
teaching our arts, our secrets...

17:23.585 --> 17:27.589
to barbarians, to foreigners,
to round-eyes.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.425
Our empire had drawn its dying breath.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.595
Sidao was a corrupt madman.

17:33.678 --> 17:37.306
The boy?
A pawn trapped in a game he could not win.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.684
And you, the Khan's puppet.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.938
I had my reasons.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.441
And what reasons have you now?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.706
I have never loved another...

18:03.332 --> 18:05.126
as I loved you.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.343
And I have never loved another.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.817
I offer you a choice.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.443
Leave with me.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.196
Return to the South.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.783
Restore our people, our dynasty.

18:38.159 --> 18:41.120
And we will destroy your Khan together.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.959
I suppose... I know the other option.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.508
By Wudang oath...

18:55.635 --> 18:58.095
only one of us will walk away.

19:01.015 --> 19:04.351
You have until tonight, Jinbao.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.616
The House of Tolui
has brought glory to our land.

19:19.701 --> 19:23.329
I was proud to attend
your brother Möngke's Kurultai

19:23.412 --> 19:25.832
just as I am now proud to do so for you.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.754
Genghis would be pleased
with all you have done.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.131
Not as pleased as I am
to have your confidence.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.428
Thank you, Great Khan.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.931
My tribe...

19:44.684 --> 19:48.270
my family, massacred...

19:48.354 --> 19:49.981
under your banner!

19:51.107 --> 19:53.442
Curse the many mouths
of Kublai Khan!

19:53.525 --> 19:56.278
One makes peace,
while the other thirsts for blood!

20:03.119 --> 20:05.037
Let him go, let him go.

20:07.248 --> 20:10.417
Why would I make war with the Tsaatan,
my relatives?

20:10.501 --> 20:13.254
- It makes no sense.
- Yet, somehow, comes as no surprise.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.131
I took no part in this, Arban.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.467
If not by your hand, by your example.

20:18.550 --> 20:22.013
Your followers remind us
what happens should we cross you.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.687
I ride for what's left of my home.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.668
Welcome...

20:53.585 --> 20:54.879
Vice Regent.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.093
Thank you, Master Marco.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.594
Have you just arrived?

21:03.554 --> 21:05.848
I was still ailing when last we spoke.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.851
My tone reflected that
and was quite out of line.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.604
So, tell me...

21:12.688 --> 21:14.690
how did you enjoy the hunt?

21:14.774 --> 21:17.068
Oh, I chose to stay behind.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.986
Really?

21:19.528 --> 21:21.322
With whom did you fill your days?

21:26.160 --> 21:28.704
Did you return with news of Quinsai?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.706
Our army performed admirably.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.459
But as you know all too well,

21:33.542 --> 21:36.170
the South will always be
a work in progress.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.925
You're early.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.847
A black wolf and a red deer.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.893
A return to our roots.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.021
What are you on about?

22:36.105 --> 22:39.775
A symbol,
to put on our new nation's flag.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.194
I was thinking a...

22:44.113 --> 22:46.240
black wolf and a red deer.

22:46.323 --> 22:50.912
Perhaps a cistern of airag
might be more fitting.

23:05.426 --> 23:09.221
We're celebrating the next Khan of Khans.

23:13.935 --> 23:16.645
It's the way of the world, isn't it?

23:18.147 --> 23:19.565
Taking what you want.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.782
Your father...

23:29.825 --> 23:31.618
wept openly before me

23:31.702 --> 23:35.706
the night his brother, Güyük,
took his seat on the Khan's throne.

23:37.124 --> 23:42.504
He wept and cried out for the answer
to the question, "Why not me?"

23:43.797 --> 23:47.801
"Because you were too afraid
to contest him," I said.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.307
He beat me.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.062
As the barishis set my nose back in place,

23:58.145 --> 24:02.566
I realized he simply wanted me
to stroke his head, take pity,

24:02.649 --> 24:05.402
join him in bemoaning his bad luck.

24:06.487 --> 24:10.657
Taking what you want
is the way of great men, Kaidu.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.535
Never find solace in settling.

24:14.996 --> 24:18.415
Attain or die exhausted in the endeavor.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.755
You didn't come here to wax nostalgic.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.094
What are the Arab's orders?

24:30.177 --> 24:33.722
Not the Arab, the Christian.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.724
Nayan sent word.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.727
You ride for his encampment.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.861
To dying exhausted.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.618
<i>The traitors fly a false flag.</i>

24:56.578 --> 24:57.829
Kaidu.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.543
I'd do the same
if I weren't playing by the rules.

25:03.502 --> 25:07.173
Why risk the wrath of the Khan's army
so close to the Kurultai?

25:07.256 --> 25:08.465
What wrath?

25:08.549 --> 25:11.218
Our army's ensnared in South China.

25:11.302 --> 25:12.719
If we choose to engage Kaidu,

25:12.803 --> 25:15.389
it will be weeks before
they can be redirected East.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.598
And by then...

25:16.682 --> 25:19.685
news of the raids will spread
to every village and every chieftain

25:19.768 --> 25:21.978
faster than we can counter it.

25:22.063 --> 25:24.773
The damage to our name
will be irreparable.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.401
My name.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.114
Let stealth and surprise be our weapon.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.702
Assemble the swiftest riders,
the best archers,

25:36.785 --> 25:38.495
and attack from the shadows.

25:39.163 --> 25:42.499
Have Jingim lead the way,
and I will provide a safe path.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.551
I've done what's been asked of me.

25:53.885 --> 25:58.014
I've cajoled, bribed with cunt and drink.

25:58.099 --> 25:59.850
What's it gotten me?

26:04.355 --> 26:08.942
If you cross paths with Kaidu
or any of his kin along the way...

26:09.025 --> 26:10.694
tear their livers in half.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.575
With pleasure.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.295
I didn't ride all this way
to become prisoner once more.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.341
Did you expect to be
bathed and lauded on arrival?

26:34.801 --> 26:36.428
I've secured your victory.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.473
- Our victory...
- I've sealed your victory

26:39.556 --> 26:41.517
and now I expect reward.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.687
- You wish to see your daughter.
- Before she's gifted to Nayan.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.689
She wasn't gifted, Mei Lin.
She was sold.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.608
You cannot see her.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.908
Not until this is all over.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.255
And it is almost over.

27:13.507 --> 27:16.927
Jingim rides to his death in the East...

27:17.010 --> 27:20.847
while our storm gathers in the West.

27:22.183 --> 27:25.269
No more than a day's ride
from the Khan's heart.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.945
You've been patient up to this point.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.281
Don't lose your resolve now.

28:04.225 --> 28:07.311
You have not graced my training field
in many weeks.

28:11.189 --> 28:14.776
Even a golden prince
loses his luster without practice.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.822
Forgive me, Sifu,
but my days have not been dull.

28:19.531 --> 28:23.201
One of my students,
an unbroken colt named Altai,

28:23.285 --> 28:26.663
was a master of such flimsy excuses.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.164
And what became of him?

28:28.874 --> 28:29.958
He died.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.339
It occurs to me that, far too often,

28:35.422 --> 28:39.718
a man walks through life without saying
that which he really means.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.762
Certainly not you, Sifu.

28:43.930 --> 28:46.016
I remember, as near as yesterday,

28:46.099 --> 28:49.102
a time when all reason for living
had left me.

28:50.312 --> 28:54.983
And from the pits of this despair,
the depths of this disheartenment...

28:55.066 --> 28:56.443
I was reclaimed.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.573
You saved my life.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.578
You will be a great emperor.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.500
Sifu?

29:16.129 --> 29:17.506
Yes?

29:18.214 --> 29:20.301
Why are you saying this?

29:23.762 --> 29:25.806
Because you deserve to hear it.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.495
I'll tell you everything you need to know.
But first, you must do something for me.

29:50.246 --> 29:52.833
How do I know you'll tell me the truth?

29:52.916 --> 29:55.419
You came to me.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.156
Hello, Ling Ling.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.411
Good day, Master Polo.

30:39.588 --> 30:42.883
How long will it take Kublai
to realize it was us?

30:42.966 --> 30:45.927
Shorter than it's going to take
the chieftains to prove it wasn't.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.763
And by then, Father will be Khan.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.892
Flags and armor.
They only know what they see.

31:12.078 --> 31:14.330
It seems our raids were successful.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.209
Jingim and a contingent of warriors
ride our way.

31:19.836 --> 31:20.921
And?

31:25.842 --> 31:27.678
We're to kill them.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.721
All of them.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.933
Look at the bright side.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.562
No masks.

32:17.686 --> 32:18.895
Ling Ling!

32:23.525 --> 32:25.652
I'm so sorry.

32:29.405 --> 32:30.866
Let me look at you.

32:31.992 --> 32:34.495
You're just as beautiful as I remember.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.287
Are you well?

32:37.288 --> 32:38.457
Yeah?

33:03.857 --> 33:05.984
Don't let the Prince ride East.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.529
He will die.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.073
By whose hand?

33:14.785 --> 33:16.369
You must say it.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.706
Ahmad.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.503
Ride West.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.046
To the twin rivers.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.923
What's there?

33:30.300 --> 33:32.218
The answers you seek.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.473
Come on.

33:38.474 --> 33:40.018
Give me your hand.

34:22.686 --> 34:25.856
- Some tea to settle you.
- Thank you, Lady Chabi.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.822
What are you looking at?

34:33.905 --> 34:35.156
Nothing, Mother.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.159
- Drink up.
<i>- Don't drink that.</i>

34:38.243 --> 34:39.786
<i>It's poison.</i>

34:43.373 --> 34:44.540
It's not.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.670
Who are you talking to?

34:50.088 --> 34:51.297
What?

34:52.507 --> 34:53.842
No one.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.426
- Who is it?
- Nothing.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.844
<i>Don't.</i>

34:56.928 --> 34:58.847
<i>She's trying to kill you.</i>

35:02.809 --> 35:05.228
It's...

35:07.606 --> 35:09.733
- It's her.
- Who?

35:09.816 --> 35:11.484
The Blue Princess!

35:19.492 --> 35:20.911
Listen to me.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.914
There is no one here.

35:23.997 --> 35:26.958
This is all in your imagination.

35:27.042 --> 35:31.337
<i>You mean nothing to her.</i>
<i>A girl with no name...</i>

35:32.213 --> 35:35.175
The pregnancy, it has affected you.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.680
It will all go back to normal.

35:39.763 --> 35:43.474
<i>And you will be discarded,</i>
<i>just like the stable boy.</i>

35:43.558 --> 35:44.643
No.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.021
My daughter...

35:49.355 --> 35:50.982
No!

35:51.066 --> 35:52.483
Take it out of me!

35:52.567 --> 35:54.402
- Kokachin!
- Take it out! I want it out!

35:54.485 --> 35:55.737
- Kokachin!
- I want it out!

35:55.821 --> 35:58.907
- Kokachin!
- Please. I want it out! I want it out!

35:58.990 --> 36:01.617
- Get the healer! Now!
- I want it out! I want it out!

36:01.702 --> 36:03.578
I want it out!

36:03.662 --> 36:04.996
Take it out.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.123
I want it out.

36:07.207 --> 36:08.667
I want it out.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.380
I have served you well.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.925
That's for me to say.

36:17.968 --> 36:19.761
And trained all your pets.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.806
For better... or worse.

36:22.889 --> 36:26.935
Delivered you the Song Dynasty
and their chancellor's head.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.981
Oh, no.

36:32.733 --> 36:34.150
No, no.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.569
Tell me, monk...

36:36.652 --> 36:40.323
this is not some form of farewell?

36:40.406 --> 36:43.451
You and you alone know why I stayed here.

36:44.452 --> 36:48.123
You and you alone
know the price of my enslavement.

36:48.206 --> 36:52.043
Your precious Wudang temples,
your Taoist scripts and written histories.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.671
You threatened to wipe a religion
off the face of the earth

36:55.756 --> 36:57.298
to enslave a single man.

36:57.382 --> 36:58.591
And it worked.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.523
You wish to go?

37:14.649 --> 37:16.609
Why?

37:16.692 --> 37:18.069
Why now?

37:18.820 --> 37:21.197
Is there no time in a man's life

37:21.281 --> 37:24.117
when he may live out his days
as Khan to his own desires?

37:24.200 --> 37:25.869
Not in my kingdom.

37:28.789 --> 37:32.834
What is there in this world left for you
that it does not include me?

37:36.004 --> 37:37.881
We're not done, monk.

37:40.466 --> 37:41.885
You and I...

37:43.636 --> 37:45.180
we're not done.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.770
The baby's heart is strong.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.773
Baby?

37:55.816 --> 37:57.943
And what of my wife?
How is her heart?

37:58.819 --> 38:00.195
She is fine.

38:10.831 --> 38:12.582
Fortunate, isn't it?

38:14.292 --> 38:17.921
That my fourth and final wife
would be the one to conceive.

38:21.091 --> 38:25.095
Do not mistake fate for fortune.

38:25.178 --> 38:28.139
Princess Kokachin was
brought to us for a reason.

38:29.182 --> 38:33.478
To birth your son,
the heir to the great Khan of Khans.

38:35.563 --> 38:39.234
Go.
I'll see to her every need.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.846
I must go, Sire.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.223
Why?

39:11.266 --> 39:12.683
I can't say.

39:12.767 --> 39:16.271
- Well, then you can't go.
- I swore an oath to you.

39:16.938 --> 39:22.610
And now you must trust in my silence
that I can and will protect you.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.166
My brother Möngke was dead.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.379
Kurultai was called in Karakorum.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.634
And I did not attend because...

39:47.843 --> 39:49.845
I had no hope at winning.

39:52.848 --> 39:54.767
Ariq was elected Khan.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.649
So I held my own Kurultai.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.402
In China.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.823
A place I knew
his supporters would not travel to.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.582
I took the throne from under him.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.003
They say I cheated.

40:23.879 --> 40:29.385
I don't think it's wholly the election
Kaidu's after, but humiliation.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.139
He wants to shame me.

40:34.307 --> 40:35.934
Disgrace my name.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.899
Would he be justified in his quest?

40:49.990 --> 40:53.159
I want you to know
who it is you're protecting.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.166
I do.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.134
Go.

42:13.406 --> 42:15.200
What is it?

42:15.741 --> 42:17.910
We're riding the wrong way.

42:21.706 --> 42:22.832
East.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.752
If you go that way, we will die.

42:27.837 --> 42:29.255
They're waiting for us.

42:30.173 --> 42:33.426
- Who?
- Kaidu's men.

42:33.509 --> 42:36.596
Kaidu's men?
How would they know where we're going?

42:38.848 --> 42:39.890
Ahmad told them.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.643
What are you talking about?

42:45.480 --> 42:46.689
It's a trap.

42:49.442 --> 42:52.570
All right.
How do you know this?

42:54.530 --> 42:55.615
The concubine.

42:58.326 --> 43:01.787
You accuse my brother
of treason against myself...

43:01.871 --> 43:05.125
my father...
his father, on the word of a whore?

43:05.208 --> 43:07.210
She has no reason to lie.

43:07.293 --> 43:10.213
She said nothing to me
until I went to her.

43:13.299 --> 43:14.634
"Kill the boy."

43:15.635 --> 43:18.012
"Send the army South."

43:18.096 --> 43:23.058
Every order, every piece of advice,
a dire consequence.

43:23.143 --> 43:25.395
As if that was his intention.

43:27.730 --> 43:30.566
Who hired the Hashshashin
to assassinate your father?

43:31.484 --> 43:33.278
Yusuf...

43:33.361 --> 43:37.072
- Sanga!
- Sanga worked for Ahmad.

43:41.661 --> 43:42.995
What did she tell you?

43:43.078 --> 43:45.456
Certain death if we ride East.

43:45.540 --> 43:48.334
While a greater peril amasses West.

44:00.721 --> 44:04.559
My father's orders were explicit.
He wants Kaidu.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.686
You have to choose.

44:07.228 --> 44:09.104
You have to give the order.

44:09.189 --> 44:11.607
These men will not follow me.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.028
What if you're wrong?

44:27.039 --> 44:28.791
Good day for a hunt.

44:30.501 --> 44:34.004
- It doesn't bother you, does it?
- No.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.549
One less prince to spoil the broth.

44:36.632 --> 44:39.219
You've been bullying Jingim
since we were babies.

44:39.302 --> 44:41.346
He was pretty. Like a girl.

44:41.929 --> 44:45.266
- You were jealous.
- I never got jealous.

44:46.226 --> 44:47.602
Not of anyone but you.

44:50.605 --> 44:52.523
He's our cousin, Orus.

44:52.607 --> 44:54.359
Our flesh and blood.

45:01.241 --> 45:04.285
When Genghis shot his brother, Bekter,
in the back with an arrow,

45:04.369 --> 45:08.122
when he bent his best friend, Jamuka,
until his spine snapped in two,

45:08.205 --> 45:11.501
when he gave the order
to secretly poison his own son, Jochi...

45:12.710 --> 45:16.922
Genghis never balked,
never faltered in his march...

45:17.006 --> 45:20.885
never allowed blood
to blind him to his enemies.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.179
At some point, Khutulun...

45:25.348 --> 45:29.059
you must choose
between your heart and your mind.

45:29.602 --> 45:31.228
You're either with us...

45:31.771 --> 45:33.063
or against us.

45:34.815 --> 45:37.151
And what if I choose to be against you?

45:37.234 --> 45:39.069
What then, Orus?

45:41.489 --> 45:44.659
I won't hesitate to act, little sister.

46:31.497 --> 46:33.833
Return to your positions!

46:33.916 --> 46:35.543
We wait again.

46:53.310 --> 46:54.479
Li Jinbao.

47:09.744 --> 47:11.245
I am Hundred Eyes,

47:11.328 --> 47:16.501
living and loyal servant
to the Great Khan Kublai.

47:28.804 --> 47:31.265
I am not going anywhere.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.894
Our old priest who died in the temple,
so long ago...

47:34.977 --> 47:36.937
- Yi Shen.
- ...he used to say,

47:37.021 --> 47:39.106
"If you choose to fight for revenge..."

47:39.189 --> 47:42.234
"You must first dig two graves."

47:42.317 --> 47:44.945
I am prepared to dig three.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.255
You have grown much, Lotus.

49:03.148 --> 49:04.567
Wudang Crane.

49:05.568 --> 49:08.445
The sutras and secrets you guarded...

49:08.529 --> 49:10.573
survived the Mongol flame.

49:50.029 --> 49:53.157
I will not let you throw away your life.

49:56.285 --> 49:58.078
Then you have to take it.

49:58.996 --> 50:00.164
Do it.

50:04.251 --> 50:06.712
One will walk away.

50:08.548 --> 50:12.635
You will bury your sword
and your vengeance...

50:15.638 --> 50:17.097
and leave.

51:22.830 --> 51:24.707
Ahmad.

51:29.503 --> 51:31.338
Hold it there!

51:32.006 --> 51:34.049
Long way from your palace.

51:47.647 --> 51:49.231
Black powder.

51:50.149 --> 51:52.860
I tracked those barrels
all the way from Quinsai.

51:54.403 --> 51:57.114
- Nayan.
- Kaidu.
