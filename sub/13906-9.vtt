BUT BEFORE I CAN
BECOME POWERFUL,

AND THE ONLY WAY
TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY

I WAS DRAWING
A PRETTY PICTURE

CAME ALONG AND SAID

THAT THE RED DAISY WAS

15:03.024 --> 15:05.014

THE RED ONE.

WHAT I MEAN.

16:05.016 --> 16:07.008
SEE, YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY
WRITE THE NOTE.

16:07.010 --> 16:09.001
BUT YOU JUST SAID
I WROTE THE NOTE.

16:09.003 --> 16:12.016
MISS BELLUM SAID
THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE
POSSIBLY WRITTEN THE NOTE

16:12.018 --> 16:14.024
BECAUSE SHE WRITES
ALL OF YOUR SPEECHES.

16:14.026 --> 16:16.002

WROTE THE NOTE?

LIKE A HEART,

LIKE A PRETTY PONY,

WOULD BUTT OUT,
MAYBE HE WOULD.

18:41.008 --> 18:43.015
BY DEVIATING FROM HIS USUAL
TEXTBOOK MANEUVER

THAN HIS LASER
MACHINE, EVEN.

EVEN BIGGER...
BIGGER THAN ANY
BIGGER MACHINE,

THAN THE BIGGEST

THAN BIGGER.

HIS MISSILES--

19:12.005 --> 19:13.014
BUTTERCUP
HURT MOJO'S HEAD,

19:13.016 --> 19:15.026
AND I WOULD HAVE
KISSED HIS LITTLE
BOO BOO,

19:15.028 --> 19:18.025
BUT THEN
I REMEMBERED HE WAS
A BAD MONKEY,

19:18.027 --> 19:20.016
SO I KICKED
HIS FACE.

FROM NOWHERE,

HE WAS ALL
KUNG FU STYLE.
"WHOA-HA!"

19:32.002 --> 19:33.004
BUT I WAS READY.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.026
THEN WE INITIATED
THE ATTACK AGAIN.

19:34.028 --> 19:36.021
I LED THE TEAM,
OF COURSE.

19:36.023 --> 19:39.007
BUT THEN BLOSSOM
GOT SMASHED--BASH--

19:39.009 --> 19:40.020
RIGHT IN THE KISSER.

19:40.022 --> 19:42.025
AND HE ALMOST
GOT ME.

19:42.027 --> 19:43.027
[GIGGLING]

19:43.029 --> 19:45.021
AND THEN MOJO JOJO
TURNED AROUND

19:45.023 --> 19:47.023
AND SWUNG
A MIND-BLOWING BLUFF

19:47.025 --> 19:48.027
AND HIT BUTTERCUP.

19:48.029 --> 19:50.027
AS SHE FELL LIMP,
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW

19:50.029 --> 19:54.002
THAT IT WAS UP TO ME
TO SAVE THE DAY.

19:54.004 --> 19:56.006
UM...I WASN'T HIT
THAT HARD.

19:56.008 --> 19:57.012
AND WHAT
ABOUT ME, HUH?

19:57.014 --> 20:00.008
UH...YOU DREW
THE PRETTY PICTURE, REMEMBER?

20:00.010 --> 20:01.014
OH, YEAH.

Mayor: BUT WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE LAUGHING?

20:03.021 --> 20:05.010
NOW I WAS REALLY MAD.

20:05.012 --> 20:06.016
MOJO WAS GOING TO GET IT.

20:06.018 --> 20:08.016
SMASH! CRASH!
I PUNCHED HIM!

20:08.018 --> 20:10.019
AND I GAVE HIM
A GOOD ONE OF MY OWN.

20:10.021 --> 20:11.026
I HELPED, TOO.

20:11.028 --> 20:13.021
BUTTERCUP WAS
BEATING UP MOJO PRETTY GOOD,

20:13.023 --> 20:14.022
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

20:14.024 --> 20:16.023
YEAH. AND THERE
WERE SOME GUTS.

20:16.025 --> 20:19.007
OH. I DIDN'T
LIKE THE GUTS.
YUCK.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.016
I TOOK MOJO INTO CUSTODY

20:20.018 --> 20:22.019
IN ORDER TO KEEP BUTTERCUP
FROM BEATING HIM UP

20:22.021 --> 20:24.012
AND DEPOSITED HIM
IN A SAFE PLACE

20:24.014 --> 20:26.011
AND THEN SAVED YOU
AND RACED BACK HERE.

20:26.013 --> 20:27.023
AND THEN WE TOOK OFF
YOUR BLINDFOLD,

20:27.025 --> 20:29.006
AND THEN YOU
ASKED US, "HEY,"
WHAT HAPPENED?"

20:29.008 --> 20:32.001
AND THEN
I TOLD YOU I WAS
DRAWING A PICTURE
