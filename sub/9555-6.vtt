01:28.455 --> 01:30.617
Yeah, we're on strike.
Boycott Al.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.185
Hi.

01:36.296 --> 01:38.822
What's going on? What happened
to the negotiations with Al?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.833
Rich, talk's cheap
and Al's cheaper.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.165
- We're men of action.
- That's right.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.329
Yeah, but, look, a strike...

01:45.439 --> 01:47.203
Why don't you try again,
all right?

01:47.307 --> 01:48.900
And just remember
that in negotiations

01:49.009 --> 01:50.374
both sides have got
to give a little bit.

01:50.477 --> 01:51.842
POTSIE:
Mmm.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.880
Why, you remember Henry Clay,
right, the Great Compromiser?

01:54.982 --> 01:57.178
Oh, right. He died a pauper.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.981
Oh, give it another shot,
would you?

02:00.087 --> 02:02.055
Hey, Al.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.714
Aw.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.314
Has it come to this?

02:05.425 --> 02:07.393
Look, the-the guys want to
negotiate some more, all right?

02:07.494 --> 02:08.393
Okay. All right.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.190
Fellas, you heard my offer.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.594
Now what do you say?

02:11.698 --> 02:12.824
Go suck an egg.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.300
Oh, yeah? Well, the same to you.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.767
Negotiate, huh?
(blows raspberry)

02:16.870 --> 02:18.429
-(blowing raspberries)
- All right, all right,

02:18.538 --> 02:19.767
that's a start.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.274
Uh, we'll continue this session
later, right?

02:25.679 --> 02:27.044
All right...

02:27.147 --> 02:29.047
yeah... uh!

02:29.149 --> 02:30.708
Get over here.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.376
Not in front of a minor,

02:32.486 --> 02:33.783
-you know what I mean?
-(snaps fingers)

02:33.887 --> 02:37.050
All right. Let me introduce you
to some of my pals here.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.251
Hey. How are you?

02:39.359 --> 02:40.793
This is Bobby, you know?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.020
Peggy's little boy.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.358
Hey, Fonz, what,
did you hire someone

02:43.463 --> 02:44.362
to work on small engines?

02:44.464 --> 02:45.363
Ha, ha, ha.

02:45.465 --> 02:46.762
You get it? With the...

02:46.867 --> 02:50.132
Even in labor disputes,
I still got it.

02:50.237 --> 02:51.602
You must be Ralph.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.037
Hey, hey, he knows you.
(chuckles)

02:54.141 --> 02:56.166
- Yeah, that's right-- and this
here is Potsie, right? -Hi.

02:56.276 --> 02:57.971
- And Richie Cunningham,
good friend. -Hi, Bobby.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.307
All right, guys,
watch this, watch this--

02:59.413 --> 03:01.711
he's gonna knock your socks off.
Give me five.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.443
Put it in your pocket
and don't let nobody hock it.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.110
Whoa.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.449
Well, he's a regular
Shakespeare.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.455
Better, better.
He rhymes.

03:10.557 --> 03:11.956
The Champ taught it to me.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.426
Yeah, well, see, now,
he calls me the Champ

03:14.528 --> 03:16.519
and I call him Kemosabe.

03:18.031 --> 03:18.964
Hey, Kemosabe.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.261
That's really cute.
(chuckles)

03:20.367 --> 03:22.426
Hey, there, Kemosabe.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.628
- Hold it, Weber.
- Yeah?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.728
I call him Kemosabe.

03:25.839 --> 03:26.738
- Ah.
- Right, Fonz.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.636
Hi, there, Bobby.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.765
Thank you.

03:28.875 --> 03:29.967
The jukebox. Can I?

03:30.077 --> 03:32.068
Yeah, let's give it a shot.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.144
(rock 'n' roll song playing)

03:41.088 --> 03:42.249
I did it, Champ!

03:42.355 --> 03:44.517
Yeah, you sure did.
You knocked my socks off.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.922
Why don't we sit down and take
a load off our feet, all right?

03:47.027 --> 03:49.189
Yeah.
Hey, you guys gonna join us?

03:49.296 --> 03:51.390
- Oh, thanks, Fonz.
- Uh, we'd like to Fonz,

03:51.498 --> 03:54.263
-but we got union biz.
- Right.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.768
Get right up in there.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.429
What's with Huey and Dewey?

03:58.538 --> 04:00.131
Ignore 'em, Fonz.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.867
Everybody else is.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.479
BOBBY:
Hey, there's Mom. Hi, Mom.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.480
Hiya, Bobby.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.846
Whoa.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.146
Having fun?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.152
Sure, I'm with the Champ.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.745
Yeah, this is my good friend
Richie Cunningham.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.552
And my good friend Peggy Clark.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.716
How do you do?
Hey, you got a great kid here.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.386
Great? Fabumundo.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.864
We have great times together,
don't we? (chuckles)

04:25.966 --> 04:27.866
Well, we have fabulous times
together too, yeah.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.402
I mean, a little bit different,
you know?

04:29.503 --> 04:30.527
Forget it. Forget it.

04:30.637 --> 04:33.197
Have I got a time planned
for us tonight.

04:33.306 --> 04:34.068
Yeah, what's cookin'?

04:34.174 --> 04:36.074
- Got, uh, movies?
- No.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.736
- Dinner?
- No...

04:38.845 --> 04:41.143
- Dancing...
- Mm-mm.

04:41.248 --> 04:44.149
I thought that we'd all go
to an amusement park.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.219
How's that, huh? Want to go
to an amusement park?

04:46.319 --> 04:48.219
Come on, Mom, we're going
to an amusement park.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.881
- Hey, Fonz, an amusement park?
- Yeah.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.619
All right.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.821
Well, don't worry about it.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.727
He usually gets lost.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.794
Oh, Howard.

05:08.275 --> 05:11.176
Well, I... What-what is wrong

05:11.278 --> 05:14.680
with getting excited
at my first auction?

05:21.621 --> 05:24.522
This is what's wrong, Marion.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.319
It's nostalgia.

05:26.426 --> 05:29.589
And it's gonna give the living
room a whole new look.

05:29.696 --> 05:32.063
It already has.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.497
Now, where shall we put it?

05:34.601 --> 05:37.502
Oh, oh. You guys.

05:37.604 --> 05:40.232
You are not going
to believe this.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.434
Flash, Jenny Piccalo
just told me

05:42.542 --> 05:44.636
that Fonzie is secretly married.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.109
What?!

05:46.213 --> 05:47.772
He has a kid and everything.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.440
Oh, Joanie, don't be ridiculous.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.574
Fonzie is not married.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.052
Well, I don't know
why he never told us.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.782
Marion, are you gonna believe
Jenny Piccalo?

05:56.890 --> 05:57.789
Dad...

05:57.891 --> 06:00.451
scoop-wise, Jenny Piccalo is,

06:00.560 --> 06:02.460
uh, better
than a gossip columnist.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.792
And just about as accurate.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.959
Well, she did know about Liz
and Eddie before Debbie did.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.229
That's right.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.403
That's a beautiful new lamp.

06:18.511 --> 06:22.072
Gives the place
a whole new look.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.741
Oh, Arthur.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.614
Yeah, Mrs. C., what?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.551
We know your secret.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.816
The cat's out of the bag.

06:29.923 --> 06:33.484
Well, I-l knew that was gonna
happen to me sometime, you know?

06:33.593 --> 06:36.085
- You mean it's true?
- Told you so.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.755
Well, now,
I got one problem here.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.094
Exactly what secret is this
we're talking about?

06:40.200 --> 06:43.761
Well, uh, about you being
married and having a child.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.840
Oh, that one.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.171
I only got one problem
with that one.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.371
Come on, Fonz.
Jenny has seen you all over town

06:52.479 --> 06:54.743
with this woman
and-and little boy.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.213
True. Very, very true.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.681
Oh, Arthur.

06:57.784 --> 07:01.015
Howard, we've got to get them
a special wedding present.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.748
Let's give 'em the lamp.

07:04.190 --> 07:08.286
Uh, I'd rather give you, uh,
an explanation, you know?

07:08.395 --> 07:10.295
Like, uh, I met
this fabulous girl, right?-

07:10.397 --> 07:12.764
Peggy Clark-- and she's got
this incredible little boy,

07:12.866 --> 07:15.494
who happens to be most enamored
with me.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.161
- Joanie...
- Right. (chuckles)

07:17.270 --> 07:19.238
I have a lot of rumor-squelching
to do.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.465
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry, Fonz.

07:20.573 --> 07:24.134
<i>You know, that Jenny Pier-Mo
sure is a gossip.</i>

07:25.145 --> 07:27.512
But what about Peggy's husband?

07:27.614 --> 07:28.706
Gone.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.682
Aw, to be widowed
and with a child.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.412
Oh, no, no, no, Mrs. C.,
not that kind of gone.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.490
Gone, like a bum;
Splitsville; separated.

07:36.589 --> 07:39.354
Went out for ice cream two years
ago and never came back.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.692
Well, that is one of the nicest
things about Howard.

07:43.797 --> 07:47.529
Whenever he goes out,
he always comes back.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.301
Yeah, look, uh, the reason
I came down here,

07:51.404 --> 07:52.894
you know, you being parents
and everything,

07:53.006 --> 07:54.633
I got Bobby playing upstairs,
right?

07:54.741 --> 07:58.041
Now, he's asking me
a lot of questions, you know?

07:58.144 --> 08:01.910
His latest one is,
"Where do babies come from?"

08:02.015 --> 08:03.540
Now, what do you tell a kid?

08:03.650 --> 08:07.518
Oh, well, that's, uh, uh...
Marion?

08:07.620 --> 08:09.179
Yes.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.724
Uh... Howard?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.122
I get your drift.
I get your drift.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.751
I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.022
I'm going back upstairs.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.426
Every time
he asks me a question,

08:17.530 --> 08:19.020
I'll make him some popcorn.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.760
I'll ignore the whole subject,
just like parents do, you know.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.199
Whoa, hey!

08:29.242 --> 08:30.971
All right, I'll hold it,
you turn it there, right?

08:31.077 --> 08:32.272
- Looks good.
- Yeah.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.371
Hey, you never did tell me
where babies come from.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.381
Uh-oh.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.417
Never mind.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.215
I don't want any more popcorn.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.755
Smart kid, huh?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.756
Well, I think the bridge
is ready now, huh?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.019
You do the honors.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.321
Okay.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.952
(sings fanfare)

08:49.062 --> 08:52.259
The Champ Kemosabe Bridge
is now open!

08:52.365 --> 08:53.264
Hey, all right.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.527
Lift it up.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.295
Now we need a boat
to come through.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.336
A boat, yeah.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.599
What am I gonna use for a boat?

08:59.706 --> 09:01.333
Can you be a boat, Champ?

09:01.441 --> 09:03.466
You want me to be a boat, huh?

09:03.576 --> 09:05.476
All right, I'll be a boat.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.273
First thing I got to do,
you understand,

09:07.380 --> 09:10.611
is, uh, just check for,
uh, stowaways, you know.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.708
Just be a minute.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.717
And I'll, uh... I'll just pull
these down here, you know,

09:17.824 --> 09:20.657
batten down my hatches, right?

09:20.760 --> 09:23.388
Always got to
batten down the hatch.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.895
Want me to be a boat?

09:24.998 --> 09:27.023
(chuckles)

09:27.133 --> 09:29.329
(clears throat)

09:30.637 --> 09:32.628

09:41.581 --> 09:44.141
(imitating boat horn):
Toot! Toot!

09:44.250 --> 09:45.740
How's that, huh?

09:45.852 --> 09:48.344
It was great,
except for the toot.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.184
Yeah, you don't have a hoot
for my toot, huh?

09:50.290 --> 09:51.189
(chuckles)

09:51.291 --> 09:52.258
All right, look.

09:52.358 --> 09:53.848
I didn't like it either myself.

09:53.960 --> 09:54.984
I'll give you another toot,
all right?

09:55.095 --> 09:58.588
(deeper):
Toot! Toot!

09:58.698 --> 09:59.756
How's that?

09:59.866 --> 10:01.459
Great. Hey, you're fun.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.037
Yeah? Well, I think
you're fun, too, you know.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.003
Yeah. Toot, toot, toot,
toot, toot, toot, toot.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.096
(Fonzie laughs)

10:07.207 --> 10:09.437
You sure made a good bridge.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.442
I tell you, we made it together,
didn't we?

10:11.544 --> 10:14.514
Yeah, I bet you and your dad
built a lot of bridges together.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.140
I never built nothing
with my father.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.740
Why not?

10:18.852 --> 10:21.651
Because you and me,
we're the same, you know.

10:21.754 --> 10:25.088
Our old men ran out on us
when we were just little tykes.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.090
Really?

10:26.192 --> 10:27.557
I just Said it, didn't I?

10:27.660 --> 10:28.752
- Champ?
- Yeah.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.728
Do you ever miss your dad?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.629
Did I ever miss my dad, huh?

10:34.734 --> 10:35.826
No.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.926
I never missed my dad.
And you know what?

10:38.037 --> 10:40.438
I'm never gonna let you miss
your dad either. You know why?

10:40.540 --> 10:42.634
Because we got each other now.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.107
Whoa.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.204
Whoa.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.576
(laughs)

10:48.681 --> 10:51.673
All right, King Kong
over the bridge! Whoa!

10:53.453 --> 10:54.614
(knocking on door)

10:56.189 --> 10:57.714
Hi, Fonzie.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.189
Hey.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.589
You having fun?

11:00.693 --> 11:03.594
Fun? Looking for
structural defects is not fun.

11:03.696 --> 11:07.462
It's a very responsible job.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.762
Where's Bobby?

11:08.868 --> 11:10.302
With a babysitter.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.598
Uh-oh.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.968
Bridge work is done.

11:14.073 --> 11:16.872
Why don't you just
plant one right here.

11:18.878 --> 11:21.779
Why don't you just
plant one right here.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.872
I'll do the planting.
It's all right.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.759
Why do I sense a good-bye
in those lips?

11:34.794 --> 11:36.159
(sighing):
Fonzie...

11:36.262 --> 11:39.095
Robert,
my husband, and I...

11:39.199 --> 11:41.725
we're getting back together.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.804
Well, he finally
brought back the ice cream--

11:44.904 --> 11:47.373
little mushy
after three years.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.308
Fonzie, please.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.707
Robert's changed.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.438
Hey, hey, hey, people don't
change just like that.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.911
Robert has.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.243
He's got a good job now.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.477
He wants to make it up
to me and Bobby.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.212
He wants another chance.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.255
Well, let me ask you
the all-important question then.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.053
What do you want?

12:06.159 --> 12:09.356
I want another chance, too.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.193
I still love him.

12:12.298 --> 12:13.766
I didn't see you say that.

12:13.866 --> 12:16.597
I still love him.

12:16.703 --> 12:17.932
I do.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.233
Hey, hey, hey, I believe you.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.570
You got the Fonzarelli
seal of approval, you know?

12:22.675 --> 12:25.167
I hope you're very happy
together, you two.

12:26.212 --> 12:29.739
I knew you'd understand.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.908
Thank you for being there
when I needed you.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.077
I'm that kind of a guy.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.179
Why don't you bring
the Kemosabe up here;

12:37.290 --> 12:38.985
we'll celebrate
one last time, right?

12:40.026 --> 12:43.360
- No, Fonz.
- No, Fonz?

12:43.463 --> 12:44.897
What's it, he in bed?

12:46.599 --> 12:49.398
Look, Fonzie, you can't
see Bobby anymore.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.168
I can't see Bobby anymore?

12:56.643 --> 12:58.771
Hey, look at this.

12:58.878 --> 13:00.846
Look at this, huh?

13:00.947 --> 13:03.473
That's right, I posed
for five minutes like that.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.312
I couldn't move a muscle,
you know.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.284
I think he did a very good job.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.822
- Yeah, it's beautiful.
- Yeah.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.414
There are six more
like it at home.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.516
Yeah?

13:16.162 --> 13:19.325
Bobby's got to get
to know his father now.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.697
And he can't do that if he
spends all of his time with you.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.996
You can't see Bobby anymore.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.132
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, right.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.341
(door opening)

13:35.448 --> 13:38.418
(door closes)

13:38.518 --> 13:41.215
You're right. I can't spend
the rest of my life,

13:41.321 --> 13:44.154
you know, just playing
with some little kid, you know?

13:56.803 --> 13:59.295
♪ Do, ah. ♪

14:03.343 --> 14:05.368
<i>RICHIE:
Okay, all right, Mom, Dad?</i>

14:05.478 --> 14:08.607
I-I want you to let me know,
uh, what you think here.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.581
About what, dear?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.708
My mustache. My mustache.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.020
Oh, yes!

14:16.122 --> 14:18.454
The light just hit it.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.493
Well, it's only
about 12-and-a-half days old.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.586
Well, I think
it looks very gallant.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.493
Oh, thanks.

14:25.598 --> 14:26.827
Lori Beth likes it, too.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.423
HOWARD:
Mm.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.763
Oh, good, you're here.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.803
All right, look, we're gonna
form a posse, all right?

14:31.904 --> 14:33.929
Better yet, we're all gonna
split up-- come on, let's go.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.371
Posse?! Wait a minute,
what are you talking about?

14:35.475 --> 14:36.533
What's wrong, Fonzie?

14:36.642 --> 14:37.973
- What, Bobby-- he just ran away,
you know. -What?

14:38.077 --> 14:40.045
And Peggy calls me up half
hysterical. I'm going nutso.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.478
Arthur, Arthur, calm down.
Now take a deep breath.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.050
(Fonzie inhales
and exhales deeply)

14:44.150 --> 14:46.676
I mean, where could he be?
You know, where could he go?

14:46.786 --> 14:48.447
When I get my hands on him...

14:48.554 --> 14:50.215
BOBBY:
Hey, Champ, you up there?

14:50.323 --> 14:55.261
I've been looking all over
for him, and he's outside.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.254
Come here.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.665
Where were you?

15:04.771 --> 15:05.863
I've been looking for you.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.804
- I miss you, Champ.
- Don't you have...

15:07.907 --> 15:10.808
You missed me? He missed me.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.174
Aw...

15:16.282 --> 15:18.011
It's boring at home.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.585
Robert's no fun.

15:19.685 --> 15:21.517
Can't even build a bridge.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.181
He can't even
build a bridge, huh?

15:24.290 --> 15:25.382
Of course not.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.822
You missed me.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.485
I want to be with you.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.824
Yeah, I want to be
with you, too, yeah.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.694
Uh, look, Fonzie,
don't you think you ought to

15:32.799 --> 15:34.927
call his mother
and let her know he's okay?

15:35.034 --> 15:36.092
Absolutely, absolutely.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.637
She must have the police
out on a manhunt.

15:38.738 --> 15:39.864
Kid-hunt.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.703
All right, look, just stay
with Richie, all right?

15:42.809 --> 15:44.299
- Okay, come on, Bobby.
- Keep an arm on him.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.003
Right. Why don't you
sit right over here.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.511
Look, I want you to meet
my parents, okay?

15:47.613 --> 15:49.103
That's my mom, that's my dad.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.580
Hi, Bobby.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.744
Oh, you poor little thing-- out
at night, you're just freezing.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.617
I'll make you
a cup of hot cocoa.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.052
Oh, that'll be nice.

15:57.156 --> 15:59.352
Your mom and dad
were very worried about you.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.984
I wanted to see Fonzie.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.185
He's my friend.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.491
Yeah, right.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.328
You know, uh, your dad
can be your friend, too.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.561
Sure, Richie and I used to do
a lot of things together.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.899
We used to go
fishing and camping.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.871
We used to save snowballs
and put them in the freezer.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.204
- Save snowballs?
- Mm-hmm.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.539
Yeah.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.476
Course then, by summer,
they'd always turn to ice.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.547
Too bad.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.581
Well, life goes on.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.916
But, Bobby, see,
the thing of it is

16:28.020 --> 16:31.888
that your father left for
a while, see, but he's back now.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.983
You know, Bobby, maybe you ought
to give your father a chance.

16:35.094 --> 16:38.257
- Why?
- Why?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.095
Throughout the ages...

16:45.705 --> 16:48.367
...the bond between
father and son has always been

16:48.474 --> 16:51.444
one of mutual need and respect.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.739
Understand?

16:55.314 --> 16:57.646
Cocoa will be ready any minute.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.411
No time, Mrs. C.
We gotta go.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.419
Come on, Bobby,
I got to take you home.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.920
- You gotta?
- Yeah, I-l gotta.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.012
Can't you stop by the garage?

17:05.124 --> 17:06.853
No, tomorrow we'll stop by
the garage, all right?

17:06.959 --> 17:08.858
Here, put on my helmet.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.554
All right, safety first, right?

17:10.663 --> 17:12.926
Your head needs to grow
a little bit.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.329
Hey, when we go
to the garage tomorrow,

17:14.433 --> 17:15.366
no looking at pinups, all right?

17:15.468 --> 17:17.334
Good-bye, everybody.

17:17.435 --> 17:18.733
I can't see you, but thanks.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.306
Bye, Bobby.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.305
Come on, let's go.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.603
Whew!

17:23.709 --> 17:27.111
Well, that is
the cutest little boy.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.681
Tomorrow? Hmm.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.943
I thought Fonzie wasn't supposed
to see this boy anymore.

17:31.050 --> 17:31.949
Well, he's not.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.450
Oh, dear.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.579
This whole thing reminds me of
As the World Turns.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.920
There was a woman
had a little boy just his age.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.425
Then she fell in love...

17:41.527 --> 17:44.121
No, or was it as
The Edge of Night?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.198
This young man
had a little girl.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.494
Would you like some cocoa?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.295
- Mm.
- Follow me.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.268
Or was it Secret Storm?

17:51.370 --> 17:55.034
This woman on her deathbed had
this brother who was a midget.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.370
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

17:59.478 --> 18:00.502
FONZIE:
Enter, enter.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.604
Hi, Fonz.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.946
Playing with your Erector set?

18:09.055 --> 18:10.216
(laughs):
Yeah.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.816
And if anybody hears
outside these walls...

18:13.926 --> 18:16.725
I'm gonna reverse your lips.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.354
- Nice bridge.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:18.464 --> 18:21.525
Bobby and I are gonna put
some tollbooths on it, you know?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.329
- Uh, you and Bobby?
- Yeah.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.462
Well, I thought you weren't
supposed to see him anymore.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.006
Hey, who's it gonna hurt?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.666
Bobby.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.470
Look, how does his father
stand a chance

18:31.577 --> 18:34.342
with you hanging around
all the time, Fonz?

18:34.447 --> 18:35.937
Bobby thinks
you're the greatest.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.881
I think the kid
shows good taste.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.111
I'm good for him.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.517
Yeah, you're great
at goofing around, Fonz.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.249
But he doesn't need
a playmate right now.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.552
The boy needs his father.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.059
What are you sticking up
for this man for?

18:48.160 --> 18:50.390
He ran out on him
when he was three years old,

18:50.496 --> 18:51.986
just like my...

18:52.098 --> 18:53.259
Wait a second, wait a second.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.390
Just like your father?

18:54.500 --> 18:55.990
Oh, is that it?

18:56.102 --> 18:57.331
Is that how you get
back at him now?

18:57.436 --> 18:59.302
Hey, you just leave my father
out of this, okay?

18:59.405 --> 19:01.430
He's got nothing to do with it,
you understand?

19:01.540 --> 19:03.907
Huh?

19:04.010 --> 19:07.878
I got along just fine
without him.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.971
Fonz, it's different now.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.516
Bobby's father came back.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.517
Yeah, so?
Now he's got me and his old man.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.246
No, no.
He can't have two fathers.

19:15.354 --> 19:19.222
I am gonna continue to see
Kemosabe, you understand that?

19:19.325 --> 19:20.588
He needs me.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.092
He needs his family, Fonz.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.684
Everybody needs a family.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.662
I didn't need no family, pal.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.960
Now, the case is closed.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.591
There's the door. Use it.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.234
Okay, bucko, I'm leaving.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.773
But I want you to think
about something.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.672
Just who are you trying
to get even with, huh?

19:36.776 --> 19:40.713
Bobby's father for coming back
or your father for walking out?

19:40.813 --> 19:41.609
You still here?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.011
- Just think about it.
- Right.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.106
(door slams)

19:50.990 --> 19:52.958
I didn't need no family.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.736
(slurping)

20:05.838 --> 20:07.203
lwin.

20:07.306 --> 20:08.467
I'm never gonna win.

20:08.574 --> 20:09.473
You're great.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.872
Thanks, Champ.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.308
Hey, next time you give me a
three-sip start, you understand?

20:13.412 --> 20:14.937
Yeah.

20:17.983 --> 20:20.680
Well, there you are.

20:20.786 --> 20:21.685
Hiya, Bobby.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.653
Hi.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.451
You must be Fonzie.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.754
Hi. I'm Bobby's father.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.851
Right.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.128
Come on, Bobby, it's time to go.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.133
- Where?
- Why, don't you remember?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.863
Mom and I made plans
to take you to the park today.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.166
I don't want to.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.138
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.470
I tell you what we do.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.668
We'll get some cotton candy.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.267
Nah.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.745
Bobby, I'm your father.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.409
Champ's more like my father.

20:52.518 --> 20:55.419
Bobby, we're a family now.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.455
I don't need a family.

20:57.556 --> 20:58.785
Right, Champ?

20:58.891 --> 21:00.882
We don't need a family?

21:04.296 --> 21:05.889
Come on.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.227
No, I don't want to!

21:07.333 --> 21:09.427
I want to stay with Champ!

21:09.535 --> 21:10.434
No!

21:10.536 --> 21:11.628
Hey, hold it, hold it, hold it!

21:11.737 --> 21:12.966
Where do you think
you're taking the kid?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.803
- Fonz...
- Hey, you butt out!

21:15.908 --> 21:17.000
You heard the kid.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.543
The kid wants to stay
right here with me.

21:18.644 --> 21:19.770
I can't believe
you're going through...

21:19.879 --> 21:22.211
This is none of your business.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.719
The kid is staying right here.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.151
Nobody's taking my son
away from me.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.313
Oh. yeah?

21:30.422 --> 21:32.049
Why don't you get
some more ice cream.

21:33.659 --> 21:36.526
Well, I guess I'm through
running away.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.427
Yeah? You're gonna stand up,
you're gonna fight me,

21:38.531 --> 21:39.521
right, punk, huh?

21:42.468 --> 21:44.402
If that's what it takes
to keep my son, yes.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.471
Why don't you take off
for three years, huh?

21:46.572 --> 21:47.869
- Don't do that.
- Why not? Why not?

21:47.973 --> 21:49.407
- Don't do that! Don't do that!
- Why not?

21:49.508 --> 21:52.205
All right, all right, all right!
Don't hit me, don't hit me!

21:55.481 --> 21:58.109
Just, uh... there's no need
for violence here.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.707
You called my bluff,
you're cool.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.913
Just back off.
Just back off.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.552
All right, you're cool.

22:08.661 --> 22:12.529
Hey, it's a nice day out, right?

22:12.631 --> 22:16.499
So you go with your father,
you get some, uh, cotton candy,

22:16.602 --> 22:18.161
go to the park.

22:18.270 --> 22:21.069
I'll catch you later, all right?

22:25.544 --> 22:27.444
No, you won't.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.947
I never want to see you again!

22:30.049 --> 22:31.414
You're no champ.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.007
You're a scaredy cat!

22:34.854 --> 22:37.687
Come on,
let's go to the park...

22:37.790 --> 22:39.519
Dad.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.622
Let's go to the park.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.536
(mouthing)

23:08.020 --> 23:10.990
Hey, it was just an act.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.081
POTSIE:
Yeah.

23:16.528 --> 23:19.259
Fonz?

23:19.365 --> 23:20.958
I'm-I'm sorry I butted in there.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.058
I guess I didn't know
what you were doing.

23:26.338 --> 23:29.501
You think
he's gonna remember me?

23:29.608 --> 23:33.374
He's gonna remember...
Champ. (chuckles)

23:35.381 --> 23:36.940
Hey, uh, want to check out

23:37.049 --> 23:38.778
that new bowling alley
just opened up?

23:38.884 --> 23:40.875
The Fonz does not bowl.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.257
Girl pin-boys.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.761
The Fonz bowls.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.560
Let's go, let's go,
let's go bowling!

23:53.666 --> 23:54.633
RALPH and POTSIE:
Bowling?

23:54.733 --> 23:56.326
Yeah, girl pin-boys.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.426
RALPH and POTSIE:
Bowling!

24:04.310 --> 24:07.541
This strike has gone on
far too long!

24:07.646 --> 24:08.670
Right!

24:08.781 --> 24:10.271
Management has failed
to compromise

24:10.382 --> 24:11.713
on even the most basic
contractual points.

24:11.817 --> 24:13.216
Better believe it.

24:13.319 --> 24:16.914
For the past three years,
we've stood on this very stage

24:17.022 --> 24:20.822
playing rock and roll
the best we knew how.

24:20.926 --> 24:23.020
And now we need your help.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.995
Because when the people speak,
management listens.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.692
And that's what makes
America great!

24:28.801 --> 24:30.462
- Yeah!
-(crowd cheering)

24:32.471 --> 24:34.405
(chanting):

24:34.506 --> 24:36.167
We want live music!
We want live music!

24:36.275 --> 24:38.539

24:38.644 --> 24:39.873
