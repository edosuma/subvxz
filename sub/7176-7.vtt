WEBVTT

01:15.659 --> 01:17.034
Lord Ragnar.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.996
It is all very well
to criticize others.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.539
If they had agreed to act,

03:26.623 --> 03:28.582
the progress of the Northmen
would have been frustrated

03:28.667 --> 03:30.501
at every reach of the river.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.004
But, while others
have neglected
their responsibilities,

03:33.088 --> 03:34.338
I have not been idle.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.425
Paris has been
prepared for this attack.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.260
We are well-provisioned
with food and water,

03:39.344 --> 03:41.637
enough to last
the whole summer.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.806
I am relieved to hear it.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.183
To some extent,

03:46.268 --> 03:48.352
we are at your mercy,
Count Odo,

03:49.771 --> 03:53.065
for you must protect us
against these pagans.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.901
Your Highness, it is
still not too late for you
to leave the city.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.904
Many here would urge
you to save yourself.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.282
Surely,

04:01.366 --> 04:03.409
they would blame me
for abandoning

04:03.493 --> 04:05.202
our capital at such a time.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.332
Perhaps they would think
it is a sensible precaution.

04:15.339 --> 04:18.090
Allow me a moment
to reflect, Count Odo.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.217
- Sire.
- Your Highness.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.939
Father?

04:37.819 --> 04:41.364
Count Odo thinks
it might be a good
idea for me to leave.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.578
You must tell Count Odo

04:47.662 --> 04:50.748
that you have no intention
of abandoning your people.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.416
That whatever happens,

04:52.501 --> 04:54.251
you will stay with them,

04:54.336 --> 04:55.711
be with them,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.254
protect them.

04:57.923 --> 05:01.384
I am sure, Father,
that that was always
your intention.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.075
Count Odo,

05:26.910 --> 05:29.578
I am determined
not to quit the city.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.874
Not in its most
urgent hour of need.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.799
The next few days and weeks

05:43.385 --> 05:45.386
will test the faith
of all of us.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.139
I pray to God Almighty

05:48.265 --> 05:50.766
that not one of us
is found wanting

05:51.518 --> 05:53.144
in either courage

05:54.771 --> 05:56.105
or belief.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.368
Yours is a heavy burden,

06:10.120 --> 06:11.454
Count Odo.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.291
You have many Christian souls
in your care.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.501
I carry this burden
with a light heart,

06:17.586 --> 06:21.213
knowing I share it
with our Lord,
and with Your Highness.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.966
But I must ask
Your Highness if you have
appealed to

06:24.050 --> 06:25.759
your brother,
the Eastern Emperor,
for help?

06:26.845 --> 06:29.180
He could surely provide
an army for our relief.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.766
I will not ask
either of my brothers
for help!

06:34.644 --> 06:38.147
I must prove myself
better than my brothers,
Count Odo,

06:39.774 --> 06:43.736
and these Northmen
have provided
the opportunity.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.157
Defeat them,

06:48.700 --> 06:51.577
and I will be seen
as a worthy successor

06:51.661 --> 06:53.496
to my grandfather,

06:53.580 --> 06:55.581
to the Great Charlemagne.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.424
So you see, Count Odo,

07:07.010 --> 07:08.844
that your burden is

07:09.387 --> 07:13.057
really much heavier
than you imagined.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.412
Raise shields!

08:25.964 --> 08:28.048
Turn! Turn the boat!

08:33.638 --> 08:36.140
Turn! Row!

08:41.479 --> 08:42.604
Mmm.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.699
Forgive me

08:53.783 --> 08:57.369
for asking, my son,
but how is your marriage?

08:59.706 --> 09:01.290
It's a marriage.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.085
It is hard to forget
what happened, and

09:05.170 --> 09:07.338
I try hard to forgive,

09:07.422 --> 09:09.631
as our Lord
requires us to do.

09:10.342 --> 09:13.010
Even those who
trespass against us.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.845
I'm glad to hear it.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.725
There is something
I wanted to ask you.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.811
Judith is
King Aelle's daughter.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.065
What does she think
of her father?

09:26.358 --> 09:30.402
And what would she think
if we decided
to overthrow him?

09:32.655 --> 09:33.906
You would really do that?

09:33.990 --> 09:35.324
Of course.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.952
How else would I become
Bretwalda, king of kings,

09:39.037 --> 09:41.413
King of all England?
Of course I
must overthrow him.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.667
I just wondered
how upset
your wife would be.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.466
From what Judith has told me,
there is no love lost
between them.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.388
That is what I thought.

09:57.639 --> 09:58.889
Do you plan to invade?

09:58.973 --> 10:02.267
Not initially. I have
certain plans in place.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.437
Various suggestions
to invite chaos.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.232
Including, perhaps,
assassination.

10:08.525 --> 10:12.152
My God!
Father, Aelle is your
ally and your friend.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.278
Oh, no.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.072
Not my friend.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.200
I don't have any friends.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.786
It's better that way.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.625
Come here, Alfred.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.378
Come to your grandfather.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.550
What a magnificent boy!

10:38.054 --> 10:39.304
I wonder how he is?

10:40.014 --> 10:41.974
Who?
Athelstan.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.475
It's that name again.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.644
Why must you forever
bring him to mind?

10:45.728 --> 10:47.479
For when I think
of that filthy apostate,

10:47.564 --> 10:49.690
it reminds me
how my wife
whored with him.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.483
And how much more
she should have
suffered for it.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.609
Aethelwulf!

10:52.694 --> 10:53.986
This is not to do
with you, Father!

10:54.070 --> 10:56.363
This is between me
and this jezebel!

10:56.448 --> 10:57.531
This harlot!

11:04.372 --> 11:06.540
Leave. Now.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.016
Here.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.559
You wanted to
talk to me, Ragnar?

12:09.646 --> 12:10.646
I miss him.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.483
Athelstan.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.113
I wish he was
here with us.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.702
Since you carry his cross,
he still is here with us.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.084
He would have been useful.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.003
We will manage without him.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.089
Well.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.098
We have no choice now.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.815
Father, forgive me.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.363
Holy Father, forgive me.

13:01.864 --> 13:06.243
For, behold,
I am a miserable sinner.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.621
I must speak
with the prince.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.457
Prince Aethelwulf!
Prince Aethelwulf!

13:22.010 --> 13:23.885
You have
interrupted the sacred.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.054
There is no excuse.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.472
There is one, My Lord.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.474
Death waits for no man.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.478
Who is this?

13:33.563 --> 13:34.938
You sent nobles
with Queen Kwenthrith,

13:35.023 --> 13:37.024
to look after
our interests in Mercia.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.449
What happened to you?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.326
The Queen

13:47.410 --> 13:50.662
repudiated the contract
she signed with us.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.372
She wants to rule alone.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.835
She tried to kill
all of us that were sent

13:56.919 --> 13:59.755
to safeguard
the interests of Wessex.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.424
She is quite mad.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.009
Speak no more.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.346
Rest, My Lord.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.214
I know we have had
our differences of late.

14:44.175 --> 14:47.260
Perhaps it is my fault,
I have not been myself.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.848
I want you to know, Floki,

14:51.933 --> 14:53.850
that I need you.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.102
Now, more than ever.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.063
And I've always

14:58.606 --> 15:00.190
believed in you.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.779
That is why

15:05.863 --> 15:09.032
I want you to be
in command of this raid.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.326
Me?

15:12.036 --> 15:13.328
Sit, sit.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.122
Take it. Sit.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.507
King Ragnar,
we have reached Paris.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.217
Now,

15:27.343 --> 15:29.177
we all want to know...

15:30.012 --> 15:31.054
The king,

15:32.014 --> 15:36.017
my oldest friend,
has asked me
to take command.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.153
So, uh...

15:49.699 --> 15:52.033
How do we best
attack the city?

16:00.543 --> 16:01.960
Some of us

16:02.044 --> 16:05.046
have taken
a closer look at the city
from further up the bank.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.215
And we suggest a plan.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.509
To mount simultaneous attacks

16:09.594 --> 16:12.387
both from the water
and from the land.

16:13.389 --> 16:16.391
I will lead
an assault on the tower
and the gates of the city.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.684
We will attack
the gates together.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.478
I said
I would lead the assault.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.188
We may need the tools
Erlendur made.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.857
I will make that decision,
if and when we
need to make it.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.776
I trust Earl Kalf
to make it.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.277
I don't think
you were listening.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.825
At the same time
as the attack at the gates,

16:33.910 --> 16:36.995
there will also be
a river borne attack.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.206
The ships will be filled
with warriors
and means of scaling,

16:39.290 --> 16:40.582
we will beach
beneath the walls.

16:40.666 --> 16:44.002
We will climb up
and gain entry to the city
that way as well.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.922
In which case, Floki,

16:47.006 --> 16:48.924
you will be responsible
for constructing

16:49.008 --> 16:51.510
whatever it is we need
to scale these walls.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.013
Don't you
worry about me, Rollo.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.682
I will make something
truly astonishing.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.267
Just wait and see.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.064
All those who agree
with the plan, say aye.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.983
Aye!

17:07.735 --> 17:08.777
Aye.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.661
Let's hope the gods
bless your efforts.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.125
Please take her.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.255
Take my baby.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.759
What are you
talking about?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.595
I cannot care for her.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.471
Of course you can.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.806
I can't.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.517
I want her to be
like your sons.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.936
I want her to be Viking.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.025
What does it matter
what you call someone?

18:31.444 --> 18:34.029
Whether she's Viking
or not Viking
is not important.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.699
What is important
is that you love
and nurture her.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.620
For if you are fortunate,
she will grow up healthy,

18:41.704 --> 18:44.372
and give you grandchildren
to be proud of.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.461
Think of Bjorn.

18:51.714 --> 18:52.881
I am.

18:53.925 --> 18:57.344
This is why I want you
to raise his daughter.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.056
Bjorn loves you.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.311
Bjorn will be much happier

19:06.395 --> 19:08.563
and better off without me.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.649
That is not true.
It is what I believe.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.360
It is a very selfish thing
to believe.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.030
I cannot help it.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.245
Your daughter needs you.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.917
She needs her mother.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.212
You must not talk this way.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.383
Pray to Freya.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.844
Freya will comfort
you as she comforts me.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.142
We women bear
heavy burdens.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.937
But it is not
to be helped.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.898
And even when we are
dealt with harshly,

19:53.150 --> 19:56.903
remember, it is the gods
who have woven our destinies.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.864
Not ourselves.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.790
My son,

20:09.333 --> 20:12.168
I have another mission
for you on our behalf.

20:12.795 --> 20:16.506
You must go to Mercia
and persuade
Queen Kwenthrith

20:16.966 --> 20:20.260
that her interests and ours
are one and the same.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.387
She has killed
six of our nobles.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.140
Yes.

20:26.475 --> 20:30.145
That is certainly
unfortunate.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.106
And she ought to
be punished.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.649
So much for gratitude.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.486
What kind of a world
do we live in,

20:38.571 --> 20:41.781
when the friends
of our friends,
kill our friends?

20:45.536 --> 20:49.247
But, still, there is a way
for this deluded Queen

20:49.331 --> 20:51.499
to find some redemption.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.834
There is?

20:56.839 --> 20:57.881
My son,

20:58.632 --> 21:02.594
Mercia has been weakened
by years of civil wars.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.637
She is no longer
what she was,

21:04.722 --> 21:07.474
and must acknowledge
the power of Wessex.

21:07.558 --> 21:10.435
Without Wessex,
Mercia is now
more than ever

21:10.519 --> 21:12.270
at the mercy
of the Northmen.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.398
As well as other
Saxon neighbors.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.358
Like Northumbria?

21:17.443 --> 21:18.485
Precisely.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.653
Like Northumbria.

21:21.489 --> 21:22.489
Yes.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.699
Those closest,
but unexpected,

21:24.784 --> 21:26.367
can sow a terrible harvest.

21:28.204 --> 21:31.039
I charge you
to go to Mercia

21:31.457 --> 21:34.375
and tell the Queen
that she may be forgiven

21:34.460 --> 21:35.877
for slaughtering our nobles,

21:35.961 --> 21:38.296
but only if she begs mercy

21:38.380 --> 21:41.633
and reconfirms her
subjugation to Wessex.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.093
If not,

21:43.177 --> 21:45.303
we will show her
the iron fist.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.473
We will invade
and we will destroy her,

21:48.557 --> 21:51.184
and her limbs
being fastened
to four horses,

21:51.268 --> 21:53.895
her body will be
torn apart.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.734
Or something of that sort.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.320
But, also,
tell her that we have

22:02.404 --> 22:04.697
a repugnance
for such measures,

22:04.782 --> 22:05.990
being Christians.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.610
Torvi.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.411
Torvi, I should have
spoken before.

22:51.829 --> 22:52.912
Why?

22:59.044 --> 23:00.128
You know why.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.298
It doesn't matter.

23:04.008 --> 23:07.010
I am not with child,
neither am I a child.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.930
I took advantage.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.473
So did I.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.190
Uh...

23:25.070 --> 23:26.654
This is for you.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.544
What's that?

23:41.629 --> 23:42.837
Nothing.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.465
Let me see!
No.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.300
You are hurting me.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.099
It's far too good
for you. Whore!

25:10.759 --> 25:13.886
The Northmen have been
scouting the countryside,
and our defenses.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.514
We must expect
an attack any day now.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.976
Gisla,
I regret not sending you
to safety in time.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.938
It is much on my mind.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.690
I did not want
to be sent away.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.234
I wanted to
stay here with you.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.945
There is nowhere
I would rather be
than here in Paris,

25:31.363 --> 25:34.032
beside you,
in your hour of need.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.450
But I must tell you both,

25:35.826 --> 25:38.202
I have been much
about the city.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.664
The people of Paris
are frightened to death
by this pagan army.

25:41.749 --> 25:45.209
So far, only their
firm belief in God's
grace and protection,

25:45.294 --> 25:47.837
prevents them
from becoming
hysterical and violent.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.590
I am aware of the need
to pacify and
control the population.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.717
Thank you, Princess Gisla.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.303
Perhaps you
yourself might have
to reassure them

25:55.387 --> 25:57.430
that we are well protected,
and have enough supplies

25:57.514 --> 25:59.515
to withstand a long siege.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.559
Though, God willing,
it will not come to that.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.811
You may rely upon me
to do everything possible

26:03.896 --> 26:06.522
to persuade the people
of our ultimate victory.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.941
Even your presence
in the city, Princess,

26:09.026 --> 26:10.860
helps them to
believe in that.

26:10.944 --> 26:14.197
Yet it is for my father
to lead us to that victory.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.365
Is it not, Father?

26:23.457 --> 26:24.957
I must to bed.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.335
I am tired.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.714
But I am glad
we have had
this conversation.

26:32.633 --> 26:37.595
And I am also very glad
that I have placed
my faith in you, Count Odo,

26:38.680 --> 26:40.807
as well as in God Almighty,

26:41.600 --> 26:44.685
for the successful outcome
of this matter.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.822
I must, too, go to bed.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.615
Of course.

26:57.699 --> 27:01.536
And yet,
I beg you to stay a moment
and listen to me.

27:02.746 --> 27:05.373
You once refused
my offer of marriage.

27:09.711 --> 27:12.088
What did I achieve?
What could I offer you?

27:13.340 --> 27:16.092
But then,
I heard how many other offers
of marriage you had declined,

27:16.176 --> 27:19.345
from men far richer,
far grander than me, and...

27:19.429 --> 27:21.222
So, it gave me hope.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.016
And my hope is
that once I have

27:24.101 --> 27:26.227
successfully managed
the defense of Paris,

27:26.895 --> 27:29.397
and the defeat
of the Northmen, and

27:29.481 --> 27:31.899
gained a new
and high reputation,

27:32.734 --> 27:35.236
you will look again
at my proposal.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.781
If you save Paris,

27:38.866 --> 27:41.159
I will forever
be in your debt.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.245
But your first duty,
Count Odo,

27:44.329 --> 27:47.039
is to concentrate
on the defeat
of the Northmen.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.626
On that,
I am sure we both agree.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.212
Higher up.

28:35.589 --> 28:39.133
Pull again, pull again.
It needs to be
more on an angle.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.678
Lend me a hand.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.264
You must be hungry.
I have brought you
something to eat.

28:45.349 --> 28:46.432
I'm not hungry.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.226
My work nourishes me.

28:49.519 --> 28:52.438
I have so many
responsibilities now, Helga.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.148
Everyone is
depending on me.

28:54.858 --> 28:58.110
My inventions will
allow us to enter Paris.

28:58.487 --> 28:59.654
You will see, Helga.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.864
Our warriors
will storm the walls

29:01.949 --> 29:04.408
and we will all win
the greatest renown.

29:04.785 --> 29:05.910
Especially me.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.204
Floki, the boat builder.

29:09.039 --> 29:12.583
Floki, the tower maker.

29:16.004 --> 29:18.005
But, of course,

29:18.298 --> 29:20.675
it's not me
making these towers.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.635
It's the gods

29:22.761 --> 29:24.512
using my poor hands.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.225
Do you know why they are
helping me, Helga?

29:29.643 --> 29:31.560
Do you know why?

29:31.645 --> 29:34.397
It's because I gave
them a great sacrifice.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.482
I appeased them.

29:36.566 --> 29:37.650
I delighted them.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.318
I filled them with joy.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.362
Do you know
what I did, Helga?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.698
Do you know what I did?

29:44.700 --> 29:46.450
I killed Athelstan!

30:08.181 --> 30:09.640
Whoa! Whoa.

30:12.811 --> 30:13.936
Who are you?

30:14.021 --> 30:15.271
You know who I am.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.480
Now take me to her.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.107
Not until you tell me
the purpose of your visit,

30:18.191 --> 30:19.817
the Queen will
need to know.

30:19.901 --> 30:22.069
Queen Kwenthrith
knows perfectly well

30:22.154 --> 30:25.823
that the son of
King Ecbert of Wessex
wishes to speak to her.

30:26.074 --> 30:29.910
She would certainly
be ill-advised if she
refused to meet me.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.329
Look, you!

30:34.416 --> 30:36.333
Do as you're told.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.085
We might spare your life.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.107
Judith.

31:03.779 --> 31:07.198
You spoke before
in the baths of the Romans.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.283
I was surprised.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.661
Most of our people
know nothing about them.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.455
I still know very little,

31:14.539 --> 31:16.707
but I was always curious.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.584
I have some words here

31:18.668 --> 31:20.795
from the Romans themselves.

31:21.755 --> 31:24.465
Athelstan helped me
to translate them.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.551
Athelstan?

31:41.149 --> 31:43.901
"Don't ask, we may
never know, Leuconoe,

31:44.569 --> 31:47.655
"what the gods plan
for you and me.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.657
"Leave the Chaldees
to parse

31:50.117 --> 31:52.243
"the sentence of the stars."

31:52.911 --> 31:54.286
So strange.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.833
As though he is here,
talking to us now.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.714
"Of expectation.
Life's short.

32:05.966 --> 32:11.011
"Even while we talk, time,
hateful, runs a mile.

32:11.888 --> 32:15.432
"Don't trust
tomorrow's bough for fruit,

32:15.851 --> 32:19.687
"Pluck this, here, now."

32:22.315 --> 32:26.569
Well, whoever wrote those
words must be very wise.

32:33.243 --> 32:34.410
Judith.

32:36.037 --> 32:40.040
As long as there is
breath in my body,
I will protect you

32:40.125 --> 32:43.377
and your son, Alfred.
Believe me.

33:01.104 --> 33:02.104
Hmm.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.081
Prince Aethelwulf.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.210
Do forgive me
for keeping you waiting.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.544
I was bathing.

34:07.629 --> 34:11.006
Queen Kwenthrith, I bring
a message from my father.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.883
He condemns the murder
of our nobles,

34:12.968 --> 34:14.718
who accompanied you here
in good faith.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.762
He insists that
you reaffirm the status

34:16.846 --> 34:18.722
of Mercia as
a client state of Wessex.

34:18.807 --> 34:21.392
So much talk
of business.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.145
Come, now.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.649
May I offer you
a cup of wine?

34:36.241 --> 34:37.825
To our alliance.

34:41.997 --> 34:43.038
Oh.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.547
There.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.590
Now, come.

34:53.675 --> 34:54.800
Sit.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.638
So...

35:08.148 --> 35:10.566
I'm quite happy
to discuss these
matters further.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.942
What is there to discuss?

35:12.027 --> 35:13.235
My father insists that...

35:13.320 --> 35:14.862
My father, my father!

35:16.114 --> 35:18.365
How old are you, Aethelwulf?

35:19.284 --> 35:20.284
Mmm?

35:20.535 --> 35:22.369
Do you always do
what your father
tells you?

35:22.454 --> 35:24.371
Don't you have
your own thoughts
and your own feelings?

35:24.456 --> 35:25.998
I have feelings of duty.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.584
I try to do
what is right

35:28.710 --> 35:30.919
for my country
and for my God.

35:34.883 --> 35:35.883
Oh.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.429
Do you know what I wonder?

35:41.056 --> 35:44.224
I wonder what
your father threatened
to do to me.

35:44.893 --> 35:45.934
Hmm.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.561
Let's see.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.815
Did he want to
tear me apart?

35:53.109 --> 35:54.485
Violate me?

35:55.320 --> 35:56.362
Whip me?

35:57.572 --> 35:58.572
Oh.

35:58.907 --> 35:59.990
Whip?

36:01.576 --> 36:03.577
Would you like
to whip me?

36:05.997 --> 36:07.956
Would it excite you?

36:11.586 --> 36:12.586
Oh...

36:13.880 --> 36:15.756
Come to my bed.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.885
After all, why not enjoy
what your father enjoyed?

36:19.969 --> 36:21.053
Princess!

36:23.807 --> 36:26.141
Lead me not
into temptation,

36:26.935 --> 36:29.436
but deliver me from evil.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.563
Goodnight.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.408
Sweet dreams.

37:16.818 --> 37:17.818
Carry on!

38:00.069 --> 38:01.862
Everything ready, Floki?

38:04.282 --> 38:05.532
Yes.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.367
Everything is ready.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.996
Tomorrow we attack Paris.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.218
Come.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.141
Prince Aethelwulf?

38:32.352 --> 38:35.103
May I present to you,
my son,

38:35.188 --> 38:36.688
Prince Magnus.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.815
Hello, darling.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.193
That is a Northern name,
that is not one of ours.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.071
Oh, clever you.

38:44.614 --> 38:46.698
Yes, he's named
after his father.

38:46.783 --> 38:47.991
His father?

38:48.076 --> 38:49.284
I think
you may know him.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.870
Ragnar Lothbrok.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.126
Our nobles,

38:58.878 --> 39:00.712
before you killed them,

39:00.797 --> 39:02.506
never reported that
you were with child,

39:02.590 --> 39:04.424
still less that the father
was Ragnar Lothbrok.

39:04.509 --> 39:07.302
Nevertheless,
he is Ragnar's son.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.472
And nothing will stop him
from returning
to these shores,

39:10.557 --> 39:12.891
both for Magnus
and for his settlement.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.477
We have destroyed
his settlement.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.982
Then he will return

39:20.066 --> 39:21.650
with vengeance upon you.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.111
In which case,
it will inconvenience
us a great deal

39:24.195 --> 39:27.239
if he were to find
a ready ally here in Mercia.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.451
So whether or not
this poor child
is Ragnar's son,

39:31.744 --> 39:33.370
makes no difference.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.955
He cannot help you.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.791
And you can't
threaten us with him.

39:38.668 --> 39:39.876
Guards.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.342
Queen Kwenthrith,

39:47.885 --> 39:50.387
you would be unwise
to kill us.

39:50.597 --> 39:53.432
It would give my father
the very pretext he needs.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.726
A pretext to invade Mercia

39:55.810 --> 39:57.686
and become its king.

40:00.148 --> 40:03.984
He may even have been
prepared to sacrifice me

40:04.068 --> 40:06.069
to attain his ends.

40:06.154 --> 40:08.071
So, if you value your life,

40:08.614 --> 40:10.032
and that of your son,

40:10.116 --> 40:13.660
then I suggest you sign
the documents we have
brought with us,

40:13.745 --> 40:16.580
reaffirming the fact that
Mercia is a vassal state
of Wessex

40:16.664 --> 40:21.084
and must, in future,
pay not only homage,
but also taxes to Wessex

40:21.169 --> 40:22.836
for the privilege.
