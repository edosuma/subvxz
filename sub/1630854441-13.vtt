00:11.620 --> 00:14.014
<i>Welcome to Commerce Street
Transit Station,</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:16.668
<i>offering Midwest bus service to...</i>

00:18.235 --> 00:20.759
Leaving home or headed home?

00:20.759 --> 00:24.763
I, um--I came here to--
to bury a friend.

00:29.116 --> 00:32.554
Yeah, I don't--I don't really
know where I belong anymore.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.166
Give the schedule
a look-see

00:36.166 --> 00:39.909
and take all the time
you need, okay?

00:39.909 --> 00:41.867
Yeah.
Thank you.

01:01.322 --> 01:03.498
John Winchester.

01:03.498 --> 01:06.109
Sir, can I help you?

01:15.379 --> 01:16.772
This is for you.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.786
Where did you get this?

01:30.786 --> 01:32.396
Who are--

01:50.762 --> 01:52.677
One ticket
for Lawrence, Kansas.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.201
Okay.

01:54.201 --> 01:58.466
We're not supposed to meddle
with things, agent.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.555
You always said
if I was gonna be stupid,

02:00.555 --> 02:02.687
I might as well
be smart about it.

02:02.687 --> 02:05.864
Yeah, that does sound about
like me.

02:05.864 --> 02:08.737
We're not even supposed
to be here.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.565
Come on, the letter
was meant for him.

02:10.565 --> 02:13.872
I just, uh, you know,
gave it a nudge.

02:15.526 --> 02:17.354
You keep an eye
on things here.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.356
I'm gonna get the damn cavalry.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.271
How you gonna do that?

02:21.271 --> 02:24.144
I got no freaking idea.

02:26.581 --> 02:29.018
One last hunt, huh?

02:30.454 --> 02:32.978
One last hunt.

02:42.118 --> 02:44.425
Mary?

02:44.425 --> 02:47.558
What the hell is this?

02:47.558 --> 02:49.865
It's good
to see you, too, Dad.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.911
So you're not going to KSU.
Does that mean--

02:52.911 --> 02:54.652
No, I'm still leaving Hunting.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.524
I just don't know if college
is what's next for me.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.352
Well, before college
came into the picture,

02:58.352 --> 03:00.397
you said you might leave town
when you finish hunting.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.659
Does that mean--

03:01.659 --> 03:03.835
No, it means
what I just said.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.055
I don't know
what's next for me.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.625
You're back, so that means
you clearly found something.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.017
Spill.

03:12.017 --> 03:14.585
I got a lead on the guy
the Akrida are afraid of.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.457
There's a Hunter named Joan

03:16.457 --> 03:18.110
who says
she spotted him weeks ago.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.677
She knows where he is now.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.679
I'm gonna meet her this
afternoon and get the details.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.594
She was on the wire,
but I don't know her.

03:23.594 --> 03:28.033
So when do we meet her?

03:28.033 --> 03:30.297
What does John
think about this?

03:32.560 --> 03:34.257
You haven't told him yet.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.390
You're not the only one
who's been busy finding ways

03:36.390 --> 03:38.740
to take out the Akrida.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.873
And ours comes with the catch.

03:41.873 --> 03:46.443
The catch is the crystal
only works once, so...

03:46.443 --> 03:48.750
one chance to save the world.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.622
Well, at least we got a shot.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.061
If this works...

03:56.061 --> 03:58.673
Mary's out of the game,
isn't she?

04:02.111 --> 04:04.244
What does that mean
for the two of you?

04:06.594 --> 04:09.988
Well, whoever this guy is,
he is ruggedly handsome.

04:09.988 --> 04:13.340
He's not of this Earth
is all that matters, Carlos.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.125
So any weapon not of this
Earth can take out the Akrida.

04:16.125 --> 04:20.216
Yes, which means
ruggedly handsome over here

04:20.216 --> 04:22.131
can take out the Queen.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.915
Finding him can't come
soon enough.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.526
Now that the planets
have aligned,

04:25.526 --> 04:29.921
the Akrida can open
the portal at any moment.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.532
Great.

04:31.532 --> 04:32.750
Death is imminent.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.578
And what happens
if we can't find this guy?

04:34.578 --> 04:37.451
Then that crystal
is our only shot.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.803
What is it?

04:41.803 --> 04:44.153
It's missing
one rare ingredient.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.546
Eye of the dragon.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.678
Unicorn's horn.
Devil's tongue.

04:47.678 --> 04:50.159
Fragment of human soul.

04:52.553 --> 04:53.945
- Oh.
- According to lore,

04:53.945 --> 04:55.556
if you lose a piece
of your soul, then--

04:55.556 --> 04:57.601
The rest fades away.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.603
No, Ada,
there has to be another way.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.353
All I have to do...

05:10.353 --> 05:13.313
say one word in Latin...

05:13.313 --> 05:16.272
and it's powered up.

05:16.272 --> 05:19.406
O-okay, <i>querida,</i>
let's not use that word

05:19.406 --> 05:21.495
until we absolutely have to.

05:28.502 --> 05:33.898
Fine. We'll wait, but I'm not
waiting around here.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.639
Let's go...

05:35.639 --> 05:38.207
let's go find the Queen and
see if she's where we left her.

05:40.470 --> 05:44.735
I'm going to stay back
and dig into the lore.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.694
If we decide to use that spell,

05:46.694 --> 05:48.609
then there has to be a way

05:48.609 --> 05:52.090
to grow back
and restore your soul.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.615
I've got you, Ada.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.108
Joan Hopkins.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.897
Samuel Campbell?

06:15.897 --> 06:19.683
It--it's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.685
I'm not sure
if you're aware of this,

06:21.685 --> 06:24.601
but our people hunted
together back in the day.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.387
Why is it I've never heard
of the Hopkins family before?

06:27.387 --> 06:32.261
My family line ended
with me a long time ago.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.745
But you're not here to
talk history, are you?

06:37.745 --> 06:39.921
You're here to talk
about the man with no name.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.663
How did you come across him?

06:42.663 --> 06:44.229
He was digging around
in things

06:44.229 --> 06:46.841
that should have stayed buried.
- Like what?

06:48.669 --> 06:50.410
The Akrida.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.936
You see, our mysterious friend
isn't from around here.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.720
There's only so much
he could do.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.852
His hands were tied.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.680
Credit where it's due--

06:59.680 --> 07:02.639
he did manage to stay
ahead of me for a while, but...

07:02.639 --> 07:07.209
I can assure you that he's not
going to be a problem anymore.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.517
What do you mean?

07:10.517 --> 07:12.780
Well, there's this portal.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.869
You see--I'm sure
you've heard of it.

07:14.869 --> 07:17.132
It's not quite up to code yet,

07:17.132 --> 07:19.482
but I managed to pry it open
just enough

07:19.482 --> 07:24.095
to toss a certain someone
and his car into it.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.707
No human can survive
that gateway,

07:26.707 --> 07:30.711
so his body
will be torn to shreds

07:30.711 --> 07:32.321
for centuries.

07:34.584 --> 07:39.110
Anyway, this, um--
this old journal--

07:39.110 --> 07:41.678
it's all that's left of him.

07:45.421 --> 07:46.814
Easy there.

07:46.814 --> 07:49.817
You're not in Lawrence, Kansas,
anymore, Toto.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.688
You're in my world now.

08:01.437 --> 08:02.699
You're the Queen.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.658
And here I thought
Mary was the smart one

08:04.658 --> 08:06.311
in the power couple.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.316
Okay.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.754
I've been following you
for a while now.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.712
And thanks to your old pal Kyle

08:15.712 --> 08:18.323
and your cartoonishly thick
police files,

08:18.323 --> 08:21.065
I know everything
about your sad little lives.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.632
But to level
this playing field,

08:22.632 --> 08:26.244
I'm gonna shine some light
on little old me.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.466
I am not Akrida.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.645
I was a human once.

08:35.645 --> 08:39.388
And I really was a Hunter, too.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.607
In fact...

08:43.261 --> 08:44.959
Mary...

08:44.959 --> 08:47.483
I was just like you.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.572
You came here for a fight,
so if you don't mind,

08:49.572 --> 08:53.184
we could just skip
the whole monologuing.

08:53.184 --> 08:56.797
Oh, there's the John I know.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.107
I want to get something

09:03.107 --> 09:05.457
through that hot, little,
adorable head of yours.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.111
I'm not here to fight.

09:07.111 --> 09:11.812
Point of fact, I want nothing
more than for us all...

09:11.812 --> 09:15.729
to walk out of here
together as one.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.732
And I did want to get you all
out of that clubhouse

09:18.732 --> 09:22.823
long enough for me
to move in there.

09:33.007 --> 09:36.097
The truth is, I could have
killed you a long time ago,

09:36.097 --> 09:39.143
but I don't want one more
Hunter to needlessly die.

09:39.143 --> 09:42.669
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying...

09:42.669 --> 09:46.020
join me, Mary...

09:47.717 --> 09:49.763
Or die.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.158
Think about it.

10:08.825 --> 10:12.263
Copy that.
Thanks, Dad.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.744
He checked the sewer entrance.
It's guarded as well.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.660
Blocking the front and back
of the clubhouse?

10:17.660 --> 10:18.835
Perfect.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.620
He's going to look
for the portal,

10:20.620 --> 10:22.622
which leaves us digging
through my family's history.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.014
If Joan was telling the truth,

10:24.014 --> 10:25.842
there has to be something
about her in this mess.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.452
Uh, we got problems.

10:27.452 --> 10:28.889
We went to check on the Queen
in her lair,

10:28.889 --> 10:30.804
and she is gone.
- We know.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.633
She's taken over the clubhouse.
- No way. Lata's in there.

10:37.549 --> 10:43.381
Lata.

10:43.381 --> 10:44.861
I love fun.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.431
And I love games,

10:49.431 --> 10:53.783
but I don't really have time
for this, Lata.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.611
I'm not here to fight.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.747
Look who's been holding back
this whole time.

11:05.882 --> 11:09.103
You broke your
pacifist streak, Lata.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.844
Look what Hunting's
done to you.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.633
Who the hell are you?

11:17.633 --> 11:21.637
Joan Hopkins,
born June 11, 1673.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.074
I'm sorry--
was that a 16 before the 73?

11:24.074 --> 11:25.902
The Hopkins family
were hunting

11:25.902 --> 11:27.904
even before the Campbells.
- So what happened to her?

11:27.904 --> 11:29.863
According to this,
she wanted out of Hunting,

11:29.863 --> 11:32.343
so she turned on her own kind.

11:32.343 --> 11:36.347
I lost my parents,
my brother...

11:36.347 --> 11:39.394
all my family to the cause.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.658
And then...

11:44.791 --> 11:46.183
I lost my William.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.838
And no matter
how hard I fought,

11:48.838 --> 11:50.579
there was always
another monster,

11:50.579 --> 11:52.668
another death...

11:52.668 --> 11:54.844
another apocalypse.

11:54.844 --> 11:59.980
So you decided if you
couldn't beat the monsters,

11:59.980 --> 12:02.199
you'd join them.
- No.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.593
What I decided was
that the monsters

12:04.593 --> 12:06.813
weren't the problem, kid.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.163
Mankind is the problem.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.426
They always need saving.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.994
And Hunters are the ones
who end up paying the price

12:13.994 --> 12:15.169
with our lives.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.780
And then what do
these rescued humans do

12:17.780 --> 12:20.522
with their precious
second chance at life?

12:20.522 --> 12:22.437
They waste it--

12:22.437 --> 12:25.614
kill each other,
beat each other down,

12:25.614 --> 12:27.834
destroy our planet.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.097
Monsters have it right.

12:30.097 --> 12:34.101
Humans are nothing
more than food.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.407
Is that you talking?

12:36.407 --> 12:39.323
Or is it the monster essence
that's powering you?

12:39.323 --> 12:41.848
<i>"The monster essence
drove her mad.</i>

12:41.848 --> 12:44.024
"She became so obsessed
with making sure

12:44.024 --> 12:45.329
"that Hunters were protected,

12:45.329 --> 12:47.418
"and she believed
the only way to do that

12:47.418 --> 12:50.160
was to wipe out everyone
who needed saving."

12:51.901 --> 12:53.903
- My God.
- "With no way to kill her,

12:53.903 --> 12:55.905
"Hunters teamed up
with the Men of Letters

12:55.905 --> 12:58.212
and banished her
from our world."

12:58.212 --> 13:00.127
And that's all that's in here.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.390
So how do the Akrida
fit into all this?

13:02.390 --> 13:05.045
And I could go
on and on about...

13:05.045 --> 13:09.745
how those magical little bugs
came into and changed my life.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.576
But I think--

13:14.576 --> 13:17.144
I think it'd be better
if I just showed you.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.019
Shh, shh, shh.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.716
It's okay.
It's okay.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.241
Shh. It's okay.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.896
Say good night, Lata.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.077
All right, Lata is trapped
with the Queen.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.687
We have to help her.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.689
Yeah, but Joan is bunkered
down, and we're outnumbered.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.952
Not to mention that spell
could cost you your soul.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.041
The Queen is about
to sing her swan song.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.391
We can't rewind this tape here.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.654
Wait.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.570
What if we could rewind
the tape?

13:54.616 --> 13:57.097
Metaphysically speaking,
if you know what I mean.

13:57.097 --> 14:00.665
On behalf of everyone,
I think I can assure you

14:00.665 --> 14:02.972
when I say that we do not know
what you mean.

14:02.972 --> 14:06.280
Okay, look--look, just bear
with me one second.

14:06.280 --> 14:10.110
Now, was this idea inspired
by a drug-induced trip

14:10.110 --> 14:12.112
I took a few years ago?
Yes.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.244
Are we judging me
for that right now?

14:14.244 --> 14:17.160
If it can keep Ada's soul
intact, absolutely not.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.292
Thank you.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.859
Now, when we used the Ostium,

14:19.859 --> 14:22.557
it pushed the Akrida
out of this world, right?

14:22.557 --> 14:24.907
Right. We used the rock
from the Akrida's world

14:24.907 --> 14:26.691
to send them
back to where they belong.

14:26.691 --> 14:30.173
Okay, so the rock acted
as directions for the Ostium--

14:30.173 --> 14:31.566
no, a one-way
ticket out of here.

14:31.566 --> 14:35.875
So what if there's
a one-way ticket back here?

14:37.528 --> 14:39.313
I mean, the mystery man
we're looking for

14:39.313 --> 14:42.098
is clearly not from this Earth,
which means neither--

14:42.098 --> 14:43.578
Is this.

14:43.578 --> 14:47.582
The journal is personal.
It's clearly connected.

14:47.582 --> 14:50.585
Okay, but how do we reverse
the polarity of the Ostium?

14:50.585 --> 14:52.761
Find my dad's lore
on the Ostium

14:52.761 --> 14:54.284
and bring it to Millie's.

14:54.284 --> 14:57.070
Let's go to the clubhouse
and see if we can help Lata.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.252
How's it going in there?

15:07.341 --> 15:10.126
- So much knowledge...
- Yeah.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.911
So much anger.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.000
She's putting up a fight.

15:16.045 --> 15:19.222
If you can hear me, Lata,

15:19.222 --> 15:22.922
this is the last thing
holding me back.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.359
The Men of Letters cast a spell

15:25.359 --> 15:29.145
preventing
the Akrida portal opening.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.976
It's time
for that spell to burn.

16:06.226 --> 16:07.618
I don't understand.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.143
There were dozens
of them out there.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.710
What the hell happened?

16:17.628 --> 16:20.022
Do you think Lata--

16:20.022 --> 16:22.938
Joan was right.

16:22.938 --> 16:26.159
She knew you'd come for Lata.
- Let her go.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.291
Oh, but she's
so much more fun

16:28.291 --> 16:31.686
than the Omega Man or that cop.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.298
- Hey, no, no, no!
- Ah, ah, ah.

16:35.298 --> 16:39.650
You've seen this movie
before, John.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.653
The Queen thought
a second attempt at her offer

16:42.653 --> 16:44.742
might come better
from a friend.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.181
Join her.

16:48.181 --> 16:52.315
Be by her side as she rids this
and every world of humanity.

16:52.315 --> 16:55.623
How many Campbells
and Winchesters have to die?

16:55.623 --> 16:59.670
And for what--history, legacy?

16:59.670 --> 17:00.889
Look around you.

17:00.889 --> 17:03.413
This isn't a clubhouse.
It's a tomb.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.198
The Men of Letters--

17:05.198 --> 17:07.852
they thought they were ridding
the world of Joan,

17:07.852 --> 17:09.767
so they cast her out
to another planet,

17:09.767 --> 17:13.945
and in doing so,
they sent her to us...

17:13.945 --> 17:16.165
and she gave us salvation.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.862
What are you talking about?

17:17.862 --> 17:21.083
The Akrida were made
by an angry god.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.652
Anything ever bested him,
he had us as a fail-safe.

17:24.652 --> 17:29.831
We were designed to wipe out
all life in every universe.

17:31.180 --> 17:34.096
But the Queen...

17:34.096 --> 17:38.231
she gave us meaning.

17:38.231 --> 17:42.148
We are freeing every world
from the tyranny of mankind.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.719
Okay.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.765
My part is done.

17:54.203 --> 17:58.816
What is it going to be?

18:16.182 --> 18:18.271
Hey.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.316
Are you okay?

18:20.316 --> 18:23.276
I'm okay. Lata.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.365
Lata, wake up. Come on!

18:25.365 --> 18:28.542
Easy, easy. Easy.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.892
Easy.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.329
Ada, I'm so sorry.

18:33.329 --> 18:36.115
Find the other way.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.683
I have good news and bad news
in that department.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.903
I feel like we could use
the good news.

18:41.903 --> 18:45.124
- I know how to hurt the Queen.
- And the bad news?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.169
The Queen has all
of her strength back.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.693
She'll have the portal
completely opened by tonight.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.608
Well, we know where
the portal is at least.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.567
Your dad called--
he found a bunch of Akrida

18:53.567 --> 18:56.178
down by what's left
of the warehouses on Prairie.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.527
Please tell me you guys

18:57.527 --> 18:59.399
found something
about how to use the Ostium.

18:59.399 --> 19:00.530
Well, whatever you feed it

19:00.530 --> 19:02.445
creates a portal
connected to that object.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.404
So we fed it the rock, and it
was able to shoot the Akrida

19:04.404 --> 19:05.318
back to their world.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.797
So, if we feed it the journal

19:06.797 --> 19:08.321
and trace the sigils
in reverse,

19:08.321 --> 19:09.583
the Ostium can bring here

19:09.583 --> 19:11.062
whatever
was tied to the journal--

19:11.062 --> 19:12.977
the Mystery Man,
if he's even alive.

19:12.977 --> 19:15.241
According to the lore
we dug through,

19:15.241 --> 19:17.634
you can only reverse
the polarity at midnight.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.332
So we need to buy
ourselves some time.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.072
By fighting
an immortal entity.

19:21.072 --> 19:24.424
Can't kill her,
but she is vulnerable.

19:24.424 --> 19:27.557
Consuming monster essence
gave the Queen monster powers,

19:27.557 --> 19:30.125
but it also gave her
monster weakness.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.432
I cut her with a silver blade.

19:32.432 --> 19:33.911
Won't be enough
to kill her, but--

19:33.911 --> 19:35.435
It'll be enough
to piss her off

19:35.435 --> 19:37.132
until the clock strikes 12:00.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.308
Okay, you two still need
to recover, so stay here,

19:39.308 --> 19:42.442
wait until the time is right,
and bring back our Mystery Man.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.357
Okay, let's hit the road.

19:44.357 --> 19:45.749
Uh...

19:45.749 --> 19:48.839
Mary, can I talk to you
for a second, please?

19:48.839 --> 19:50.232
Yeah.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.757
Okay, look, I know that you're
gonna fight me on this,

19:53.757 --> 19:55.368
but I just--

19:55.368 --> 19:58.632
Just listen, please.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.200
Look, you have to stay behind.
- What? No!

20:01.200 --> 20:03.289
We all know you're
the best Hunter that we have,

20:03.289 --> 20:04.855
just like we all know

20:04.855 --> 20:07.380
that whoever goes out there
and faces Joan...

20:07.380 --> 20:09.556
Is probably not coming back.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.645
We'll go out there, okay?

20:11.645 --> 20:14.735
And we'll buy you guys
some time.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.345
And when you find
the Mystery Man,

20:16.345 --> 20:18.478
someone's gonna have
to lead him into battle,

20:18.478 --> 20:20.567
and that someone has to be you.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.090
I know what you're thinking--

20:22.090 --> 20:24.527
that I'm running
towards danger, but I'm not.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.359
For the first time...

20:32.535 --> 20:35.669
I'm running towards hope.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.888
Hmm.

20:39.586 --> 20:42.458
So, if we do this...

20:42.458 --> 20:45.461
if we win...

20:45.461 --> 20:47.158
if we save the world...

20:49.900 --> 20:51.162
Then you're free.

20:53.426 --> 20:56.124
Listen, before you go,
I have to tell you something.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.082
Mm-mm.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.959
Tell me when you see me again.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.356
Hello, boys.

21:54.356 --> 21:58.229
I'm guessing you're not here
to surrender, are you?

22:00.449 --> 22:03.409
Samuel, I can save
your little girl.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.933
So she can be your slave?

22:05.933 --> 22:07.935
No, thanks.

22:07.935 --> 22:11.591
Carlos, you want to talk some
sense into these two idiots?

22:11.591 --> 22:13.375
I mean, there's no amount
of ghouls

22:13.375 --> 22:16.204
that you can kill that will
fill that hole in your heart.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.511
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Are you still talking?

22:22.297 --> 22:24.908
You don't need my sales
pitch, though, do you, honey?

22:24.908 --> 22:27.346
You're already a monster, John.

22:29.217 --> 22:32.307
- Hunters don't kneel.
- That's right.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.526
They just die.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.308
It's time.

23:36.284 --> 23:39.026
What? What's going on?
Why is nothing happening?

23:39.026 --> 23:39.983
It did.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.479
The journal pulled out
something it was connected to,

23:57.479 --> 23:59.655
but our Mystery Man isn't here,
which means he must be--

23:59.655 --> 24:01.309
Dead.

24:03.093 --> 24:07.184
- What now?
- We go for a drive.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.926
This car.
- It's not of this Earth.

24:09.926 --> 24:12.929
Detroit steel makes
a hell of a weapon.

24:12.929 --> 24:14.670
If the car takes out
the Queen,

24:14.670 --> 24:16.585
the rest of the Akrida
are dead.

24:18.631 --> 24:21.503
Let's go run this son
of a bitch into the ground.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.494
Before I kill you, John,

24:55.494 --> 24:57.496
I want to give you
some much-needed peace.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.889
When the Men of Letters
stopped my last invasion,

24:59.889 --> 25:01.717
I said enough is enough.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.937
Unlike Hunters,
they never played fair,

25:03.937 --> 25:06.243
so I thought, why should I?

25:24.087 --> 25:27.047
After your dad's
boys' club beat me,

25:27.047 --> 25:30.267
I used all my remaining power,

25:30.267 --> 25:31.704
every ounce of it.

25:31.704 --> 25:34.358
What did you do?

25:34.358 --> 25:37.927
I wiped out
the Men of Letters, John...

25:37.927 --> 25:39.712
including your father.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.422
Are we sure
this is going to work?

25:54.422 --> 25:55.423
No.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.251
Everybody get out now.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.644
Mary.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.342
Keep an eye on him, will you?

26:43.863 --> 26:47.606
<i>♪ Well, I just got into town
about an hour ago ♪</i>

26:49.651 --> 26:53.350
<i>♪ Took a look around,
see which way the wind-- ♪</i>

27:15.198 --> 27:16.591
Mary.

28:06.641 --> 28:07.816
Hey.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.435
John.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.789
- You okay?
- Yeah.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.891
How did you guys survive?

28:42.895 --> 28:45.941
She kept Mary safe...

28:45.941 --> 28:47.595
me too.

28:47.595 --> 28:50.816
Of course, there's not a lot
that can tear me apart.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.818
I'm already dead.

28:54.471 --> 28:57.170
I was stuck
in the world between worlds,

28:57.170 --> 28:58.911
so I stayed close
to that portal,

28:58.911 --> 29:00.564
and as soon as I saw
baby come through,

29:00.564 --> 29:02.088
I hopped in
and grabbed the wheel.

29:02.088 --> 29:03.437
So who are you?

29:08.224 --> 29:12.663
I'm a Hunter, just like you.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.887
But I'm not from this Earth.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.236
And how did you get here?

29:20.236 --> 29:23.849
When I died,
I made it to heaven.

29:29.028 --> 29:31.595
And she was waiting for me.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.598
So I went for a drive,

29:34.598 --> 29:36.818
and then I took
a little detour.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.820
Through the multiverse.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.955
S-so what
were you looking for?

29:42.955 --> 29:45.784
That's a good question, Carlos.

29:49.004 --> 29:51.702
I was looking for my family.

29:54.575 --> 29:57.056
See, I come from a long line
of Hunters.

29:57.056 --> 30:00.624
I guess I was hoping that
somewhere out there was a Earth

30:00.624 --> 30:02.975
that had a version
where my family had a shot

30:02.975 --> 30:05.194
at a happy ending.

30:05.194 --> 30:09.851
When I was driving,
I caught wind of the Akrida.

30:09.851 --> 30:13.986
Turns out that they were one
of Chuck's last creations.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.857
Who's Chuck?

30:17.511 --> 30:18.642
God.

30:20.949 --> 30:25.084
It's a long story, but, uh...

30:25.084 --> 30:28.087
basically, he's a real dick.

30:28.087 --> 30:30.219
He left the Akrida behind
to wipe out all of existence

30:30.219 --> 30:31.699
in case he failed.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.048
Well...

30:33.048 --> 30:35.137
he failed.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.399
Eventually the Akrida

30:36.399 --> 30:38.271
were going to make their way
to my world,

30:38.271 --> 30:41.317
and I got family there,
so I couldn't let that happen.

30:41.317 --> 30:43.015
T-the letter,
why did you--

30:43.015 --> 30:47.149
I took my little detour.
The rules were simple.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.108
Don't mess with anything.

30:49.108 --> 30:51.284
Well...

30:51.284 --> 30:53.721
I gave it a little nudge.

30:56.071 --> 30:58.857
Thought it might need
a little help.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.948
Looks like it worked out
pretty well.

31:04.993 --> 31:07.169
So now
that the Akrida are gone,

31:07.169 --> 31:09.606
you all can choose
your own destiny.

31:11.217 --> 31:13.523
You can write your own story.

31:16.396 --> 31:19.878
And you can get
back to yours.

31:19.878 --> 31:26.275
It's all right.
They're--they're with me.

31:26.275 --> 31:29.539
This is Bobby.
That's Jack.

31:33.587 --> 31:36.111
They're family.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.852
Excuse me.

31:39.593 --> 31:40.986
You okay?

31:40.986 --> 31:44.337
I told you I'd figure it out.

31:44.337 --> 31:47.862
Didn't say I wouldn't get us
in more trouble.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.126
Look at 'em.

31:51.126 --> 31:54.173
Man, this is
all kinds of weird--

31:54.173 --> 31:57.350
seeing Samuel
with a full head of hair.

31:57.350 --> 31:58.394
Right?

31:58.394 --> 32:00.570
- Dean.
- Yeah.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.050
No, I know.

32:02.050 --> 32:03.747
I know, Jack.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.359
When I restored things,

32:06.359 --> 32:09.928
I wanted mankind
to make their own fate.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.496
That meant no interference
from on high,

32:13.496 --> 32:15.977
anywhere...

32:15.977 --> 32:18.023
no exceptions.

32:18.023 --> 32:21.156
I couldn't let our world
get destroyed.

32:21.156 --> 32:25.378
Sam's still down there, okay?
He deserves a good, long life.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.206
Hell, they all do.

32:32.037 --> 32:35.997
So, if you want to cast me
out of heaven...

32:35.997 --> 32:38.217
so be it.

32:38.217 --> 32:40.828
If we're taking a vote,

32:40.828 --> 32:44.875
I'd say you give the guy
another chance.

32:49.184 --> 32:53.623
There's always another case
with you Hunters...

32:53.623 --> 32:55.060
even in death.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.238
Well...

32:59.238 --> 33:01.022
if you're going to meddle
in things,

33:01.022 --> 33:03.590
finish what you started.

33:13.165 --> 33:14.818
After this...

33:14.818 --> 33:17.212
it's time to get around
to the...

33:17.212 --> 33:20.259
"there'll be peace
when you are done"...

33:20.259 --> 33:21.782
part of the song.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.097
Listen, um...

33:32.097 --> 33:34.316
b-before I go...

33:36.492 --> 33:38.842
I want to give
you two something.

33:45.588 --> 33:48.461
My dad...

33:48.461 --> 33:50.506
he, uh...

33:51.899 --> 33:55.642
Kept a Hunter's journal,
looked just like this.

33:58.514 --> 34:01.343
I lived my whole life
by that damn thing.

34:04.303 --> 34:06.696
Well, this is
my Hunter's journal.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.787
So if you're gonna stay
in this game...

34:12.746 --> 34:15.836
This will help guide
you through it.

34:20.188 --> 34:21.798
Thank you.

34:24.149 --> 34:27.282
I know you're thinking
about quitting Hunting.

34:27.282 --> 34:29.632
Believe me, I understand.

34:31.286 --> 34:34.115
But you need to do me
one favor.

34:35.290 --> 34:38.728
Keep an eye out
for a yellow-eyed demon.

34:38.728 --> 34:42.732
And if you even catch a hint
of that son of a bitch...

34:47.998 --> 34:49.304
I need you to use this.

34:58.922 --> 35:01.577
Your family...

35:01.577 --> 35:03.101
did you ever find a version

35:03.101 --> 35:07.105
where they had a shot
of a happy ending?

35:16.244 --> 35:18.290
I think I did.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.475
You never told us your name.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.180
Hetfield...

35:39.180 --> 35:41.269
James Hetfield.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.987
Now what?

36:05.467 --> 36:07.469
We go home.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.515

36:58.346 --> 37:00.305
We did it.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.439
Thank you.

37:11.446 --> 37:15.276
- Be safe out there.
- I love you, too, kiddo.

37:18.714 --> 37:21.108
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

37:21.108 --> 37:24.894
When you went
through the portal...

37:24.894 --> 37:26.722
what'd you see?

37:26.722 --> 37:29.377
It was kind of a blur, but...

37:29.377 --> 37:31.466
I saw everything,

37:31.466 --> 37:34.817
every possible version
of myself.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.604
Any of them look appealing?

37:38.604 --> 37:40.345
I'm gonna make my own.

37:43.522 --> 37:46.133
That's why
you're leaving, right?

37:47.961 --> 37:51.617
Well, everywhere I look here
is a reminder of who I was.

37:51.617 --> 37:56.448
And if I'm gonna figure out
who I'm going to be...

37:56.448 --> 37:59.494
Look, when I got back, I...

37:59.494 --> 38:01.061
I was lost.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.719
Now I...

38:06.719 --> 38:09.504
I found where I belong.

38:09.504 --> 38:12.072
Being a Hunter?

38:12.072 --> 38:15.554
But I can't be
the best version of that

38:15.554 --> 38:17.599
until I face the anger
inside of me.

38:17.599 --> 38:20.950
I don't know
if it's through meditation

38:20.950 --> 38:23.475
or therapy

38:23.475 --> 38:25.738
or something, but I'm...

38:25.738 --> 38:27.522
I'm going to figure out
a way to make sure

38:27.522 --> 38:29.263
it's not in the driver's seat.

38:31.657 --> 38:34.137
Okay, I guess I just...

38:34.137 --> 38:35.704
I don't know.

38:35.704 --> 38:39.099
I guess I just wanted you
to know that before you left.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.535
It's not forever.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.412
- Do me a favor?
- Anything.

38:49.501 --> 38:51.546
No goodbyes.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.603
Found us a new case.

39:04.603 --> 39:07.649
And for once, it's by a beach.

39:09.172 --> 39:13.394
- Werewolves don't surf.
- Only one way to find out.

39:16.658 --> 39:19.008
I got it.

39:33.283 --> 39:36.635
I thought we agreed...

39:36.635 --> 39:38.593
no goodbyes.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.639
This isn't goodbye.

39:42.031 --> 39:45.644
I don't know where I'm going
or what I'm doing

39:45.644 --> 39:48.429
or how long it's gonna be
until I figure myself out,

39:48.429 --> 39:50.039
but...

39:50.039 --> 39:53.434
maybe there's something
out there for the both of us.

39:53.434 --> 39:56.437
And we can figure it out
together during the day,

39:56.437 --> 39:58.613
and you can hunt at night.

39:58.613 --> 40:01.616
I don't know what to say.

40:01.616 --> 40:04.271
Send us a postcard
when you do.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.077
Okay, uh, music
is definitely in order.

40:28.077 --> 40:30.863
We got Hendrix--
- Ah, ah, ah.

40:30.863 --> 40:32.604
I was reading some
of Hetfield's journal,

40:32.604 --> 40:35.433
and he was very specific
on this issue.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.567
Driver picks the music,
shotgun shuts their cake hole.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.134
All right.
