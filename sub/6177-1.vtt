02:04.130 --> 02:05.848
Miss Mason.

02:06.010 --> 02:07.529
Since your listening skills
are so adept,

02:07.690 --> 02:09.609
perhaps you could tell me how many
molecules of oxygen

02:09.770 --> 02:11.768
a molecule of haemoglobin can hold
in the blood for transport.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.849
- Four.
- And haemoglobin is what?

02:14.010 --> 02:16.209
The iron-containing
oxygen-transport metalloprotein

02:16.369 --> 02:19.009
- in the red blood cells of vertebrates.
- Anywhere else?

02:19.170 --> 02:21.729
In the tissues of some invertebrates.

02:21.890 --> 02:24.089
Do not bring cell phones
into my classroom.

02:24.250 --> 02:27.088
- No, sir.
- It is very fucking rude.

02:29.210 --> 02:32.408
Now, back to where we left off.
Amputation reattachment.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.849
An amputated arm...

02:34.010 --> 02:35.889
...can be surgically reattached
if the patient receives

02:36.050 --> 02:38.249
surgical attention within four hours.

02:38.410 --> 02:43.568
An amputated hand within eight,
amputated fingers within 12.

02:43.730 --> 02:47.929
So, four, eight, 12.

02:51.769 --> 02:55.690
Dr Grant, I am so sorry.
I'm really embarrassed about that.

02:55.851 --> 02:58.969
Surgeons don't have the luxury about
being sorry about anything, Mary.

02:59.131 --> 03:01.489
I have enough useless twats in my class.
I'm not gonna abide by one of my

03:01.650 --> 03:04.089
- promising students falling asleep.
- I am so sorry.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.929
- I was up all night studying.
- Uh-huh. That's what they all say.

03:07.090 --> 03:10.169
- I was suturing a turkey.
- Uh-huh. Did you eat it afterwards?

03:10.330 --> 03:12.849
It wasn't an eating turkey.

03:13.009 --> 03:17.529
I see great potential in you, Mary,
if you stop fucking up in my class.

03:17.690 --> 03:18.889
I will.

03:20.009 --> 03:22.730
Good surgeons don't
make any mistakes, Mary.

03:23.569 --> 03:26.570
Miss Mason, it says here
that you've been late on a payment.

03:26.730 --> 03:29.608
I know, I called last Friday
and I put $40 in my account.

03:29.770 --> 03:32.409
It does say here that
you did make a payment on Friday.

03:32.570 --> 03:35.449
- But $40 isn't usually enough...
- No one said that my service

03:35.611 --> 03:36.970
was gonna be cut off,
and when I called on Friday,

03:37.131 --> 03:38.490
they said everything was fine.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.729
They obviously made a mistake.

03:40.890 --> 03:44.289
I want you to know that this is
something we don't usually do.

03:44.450 --> 03:48.049
I'm going to restore your service
without a reconnection fee.

03:48.210 --> 03:50.809
When will you be able
to make your next payment?

03:50.971 --> 03:53.649
Um...

03:55.250 --> 04:00.249
I should be able to put some money
on it in... let's say two weeks.

04:01.611 --> 04:03.330
How much do I have to put on
to keep me in the clear?

04:03.490 --> 04:08.129
You are three months behind,
$364 should be enough.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.009
OK. Um, what's the least
that I could put on it?

04:11.169 --> 04:14.609
$364.

04:48.250 --> 04:51.888
Yeah, well, that's
'cause my phone got cut off.

04:52.049 --> 04:54.689
What? Your phone is cut off? When?

04:56.490 --> 04:58.289
Sometime this afternoon, I think.

04:58.450 --> 05:00.569
But everything's fine now.
It's all figured out.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.369
I have a little.
I can go in the bank tomorrow.

05:04.530 --> 05:08.889
No. No, no, no. It's, uh...
I don't need it, Nana.

05:09.050 --> 05:11.809
The, uh...
I've already talked to the bank.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.289
The phone company just made a mistake.

05:14.450 --> 05:16.888
- So everything's OK.
- Oh, good.

05:17.049 --> 05:20.009
Is everyone being nice to you
in the school?

05:20.170 --> 05:23.010
Nobody's trying to lie down
with your boyfriend?

05:23.170 --> 05:25.529
I don't have a boyfriend.

05:25.690 --> 05:29.209
And it doesn't really happen
in med school anyway.

05:29.370 --> 05:34.009
Well, I was watching this show,
and this blonde was trying to make love

05:34.170 --> 05:37.729
to all the boys, and when her friend
find out, she made up a story

05:37.890 --> 05:41.329
so everyone would think she was the one
making love to everyone.

05:41.490 --> 05:46.649
I didn't know that happened. Everyone
today is just taking off their clothes,

05:46.810 --> 05:50.609
saying, "Let's make love."
Like it's nothing.

05:50.770 --> 05:53.569
Well, I'm sure that was
just the show, Nana.

05:53.731 --> 05:56.529
They have to do that
so that people will watch it.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.610
They won't wanna watch
if nothing shocking happens.

05:59.770 --> 06:02.769
They never have that sort of thing
in Budapest.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.770
There was a road, where the women
would be on the corner.

06:05.931 --> 06:09.490
- Corva, the woman.
- Whores.

06:46.010 --> 06:48.090
- Billy?
- Over there.

07:08.890 --> 07:10.730
I'm doing an interview.

07:13.570 --> 07:15.009
Sorry.

07:18.250 --> 07:21.050
- What's this?
- This is my resume.

07:21.211 --> 07:23.250
I didn't know if you
needed one or not.

07:23.411 --> 07:26.769
You don't need it to work here,
but it is nice to find out

07:26.931 --> 07:29.530
some of your dirty secrets.

07:29.691 --> 07:31.970
Thank you... Mary.

07:34.810 --> 07:39.010
Got a lot of schooling on here.
Gonna be a doctor?

07:39.171 --> 07:42.490
- Surgeon.
- Surgeon.

07:42.651 --> 07:45.369
- You any good?
- I'm very good.

07:45.530 --> 07:49.450
And I'm also very broke
and I need to make money, so...

07:49.611 --> 07:52.090
Direct. I like that.

07:53.371 --> 07:57.250
So... Mary.

07:57.411 --> 08:00.410
Now comes the unpleasant portion
of the interview.

08:02.130 --> 08:04.650
You're not fat under there, are you?

08:04.811 --> 08:07.329
No. Starving student.

08:07.490 --> 08:11.489
If you don't mind... Mary. Please.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.409
Appropriate?

08:25.410 --> 08:28.089
Very appropriate.

08:28.251 --> 08:30.169
Rad.

08:31.811 --> 08:34.009
Why don't you try a little walk.

08:37.289 --> 08:40.249
You might wanna walk
a little sexier, Mary.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.490
How about a massage? Come on.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.929
Not through the jacket.

08:57.851 --> 09:00.490
Yeah... A little harder, Mary.

09:01.650 --> 09:03.529
Oh, yeah...

09:06.490 --> 09:09.089
- We got a clusterfuck.
- Keep going.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.809
Lance, can't you see
I'm doing an interview?

09:12.970 --> 09:14.290
Black's not coming back.

09:14.451 --> 09:17.489
What do you mean
Black's not coming back? Call him.

09:17.650 --> 09:20.370
I called his cell phone
six fucking times.

09:21.091 --> 09:22.249
Fuck!

09:24.410 --> 09:26.090
Wait right here.

09:36.050 --> 09:40.770
Mary, what level are you at
to becoming a surgeon?

09:40.931 --> 09:42.930
I'm... still a ways off.

09:43.090 --> 09:46.370
I have a residency programme to complete,
but I've done almost all the...

09:46.531 --> 09:48.289
Do you wanna make five grand?

09:49.691 --> 09:52.170
- What do I have to do?
- No questions asked.

09:52.331 --> 09:56.569
After you're done, I hand you $5,000
and you don't have to show me your tits.

09:57.490 --> 09:59.130
What do you want me to do?

09:59.770 --> 10:03.330
You know what?
Fucking forget it!

10:03.490 --> 10:06.250
I'll do anything you want
for 5,000 cash tonight.

10:08.131 --> 10:09.649
Follow me.

10:11.770 --> 10:14.530
Oh... Hang on. You good?

10:15.771 --> 10:17.329
- Yes.
- Go.

10:23.370 --> 10:25.610
Yeah, we'd prefer it if Rat
was not to die tonight.

10:25.771 --> 10:28.770
He's already been drugged up,
so feel free to just dig right in.

10:28.931 --> 10:30.290
Whoa...

10:31.012 --> 10:36.490
I'm no expert on the subject here,
but I think that time might be an issue.

10:37.371 --> 10:38.490
Here you go.

10:55.051 --> 10:56.570
It's OK. Shh...

10:56.731 --> 10:58.730
Don't worry. You're gonna be just fine.

10:59.331 --> 11:02.130
Shh... OK.

12:21.971 --> 12:25.169
- Hello?
- Is this Dr Mason?

12:40.250 --> 12:42.289
I think you've been calling
the wrong number.

12:42.450 --> 12:44.570
You don't even know who's calling.

12:47.291 --> 12:50.690
- Who's calling?
- My name is Beatress.

12:51.651 --> 12:53.050
I'm quite sure
I don't know any Beatress,

12:53.211 --> 12:55.929
and this isn't a Dr Mary's number
that you're calling anyway.

12:56.091 --> 12:58.249
But I said Dr Mason.

13:01.851 --> 13:04.089
Fuck.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.890
- Hello?
- Hi. I've been trying to call you.

13:15.052 --> 13:17.210
Sorry, I was on the other line.
What's up?

13:17.372 --> 13:18.530
The mall locked us out.

13:18.691 --> 13:21.530
There's no more scheduled shifts
until we get this sorted out.

13:21.691 --> 13:24.651
- What happened?
- I haven't been able to pay the rent.

13:24.811 --> 13:27.770
They got tired of waiting.
Poof, they locked us out.

13:27.931 --> 13:30.890
So... that's it?

13:31.051 --> 13:33.250
Pretty much.
I'll call you if anything changes.

13:33.411 --> 13:35.290
I'm really sorry, Mary.

14:02.091 --> 14:06.170
- Yes?
- A package. Mary Mason.

14:06.331 --> 14:08.410
What? I'm Mary Mason.

14:08.571 --> 14:10.970
I need you to sign for a package.

14:11.131 --> 14:13.290
Fine. 211 .

14:40.052 --> 14:41.851
You didn't really leave me
much choice.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.770
- Who are you?
- You can put the bat down, Dr Mason.

14:44.931 --> 14:47.211
I'm completely harmless.
My name is Beatress Johnson.

14:47.371 --> 14:50.170
- We spoke earlier.
- How do you know where I live?

14:50.331 --> 14:52.890
It's on your resume.
It's a pretty impressive resume,

14:53.052 --> 14:54.970
with all that doctor stuff on it.

14:55.131 --> 14:57.211
Must be expensive.

14:57.371 --> 15:00.051
Listen, I'm just a desperate woman
looking for help.

15:01.612 --> 15:05.330
Well, if you need some kind of help,
I suggest you go to a hospital.

15:05.491 --> 15:07.930
- What if they refuse to help us?
- Then call your HMO.

15:08.091 --> 15:10.771
- Get it figured out, I don't know!
- It's not a financial issue.

15:10.932 --> 15:13.931
Money, I got lots of. I'll give you $200

15:14.092 --> 15:16.490
if you just let me say what I'm gonna
say, and I'm gonna say anyway.

15:16.652 --> 15:20.091
- And then you'll leave?
- Mm-hm. You'll never see me again.

15:21.492 --> 15:23.771
- Can I see the money?
- Hm.

15:30.571 --> 15:32.810
What do you see when you look at me?

15:35.172 --> 15:37.690
You kind of resemble Betty Boop.

15:39.132 --> 15:44.091
- Kind of?
- Well, it's a little uncanny.

15:44.252 --> 15:47.611
I'm lucky enough to be able to afford to
make myself look on the outside

15:47.772 --> 15:49.771
the way I feel on the inside.

15:49.932 --> 15:52.451
Fourteen different surgeries
to get me to look like this.

15:52.612 --> 15:55.851
Some gone out of the country
to find the best doctor for the job.

15:56.012 --> 15:58.651
In my travels,
I met another girl like me.

15:58.811 --> 16:01.730
But she hasn't been able
to find someone to finish her.

16:01.891 --> 16:05.170
- I wanna hire you.
- Well, I'm not a doctor.

16:05.331 --> 16:09.290
- I told you that.
- I wanna pay you $10,000, cash.

16:09.451 --> 16:11.770
That ought to solve
your money problems for a while.

16:11.931 --> 16:13.611
Especially with what Billy
gave you last night.

16:13.771 --> 16:15.449
I'm not doing what
I did last night again ever.

16:15.611 --> 16:18.930
I'm not asking you to.
She's just... she's a nice girl

16:19.092 --> 16:21.490
who wants an unconventional operation.

16:23.131 --> 16:26.090
- How unconventional?
- She just wants some skin removed

16:26.251 --> 16:29.130
for, um... cosmetic reasons.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.410
My niece, she's a receptionist
at a veterinary clinic.

16:32.571 --> 16:35.050
We can use the operating room
after hours.

16:41.131 --> 16:44.530
I obviously do not have...

16:44.691 --> 16:48.130
...any kind of insurance package
for this kind of thing.

16:48.291 --> 16:50.250
And I can't guarantee
that the skin removal

16:50.411 --> 16:53.730
- will produce the desired effects.
- I'll give you two grand

16:53.891 --> 16:57.690
- just to show up.
- What time does the clinic close?

17:04.012 --> 17:06.651
- Hello?
- You missed class.

17:06.811 --> 17:09.050
I hope it wasn't our conversation
the previous day that made you

17:09.211 --> 17:11.530
think there are better things to do
than attend my lecture.

17:11.691 --> 17:15.810
No, I had some family matters
to attend to yesterday.

17:15.972 --> 17:18.770
You gave me your word that you
weren't gonna fuck up any more.

17:18.931 --> 17:20.250
I'm not. I won't.

17:20.411 --> 17:23.450
Your actions show that your word
is worth fuck all.

17:23.611 --> 17:27.251
You miss another lecture, you can
find another class to not attend.

17:44.652 --> 17:46.491
Thank you for coming, Dr Mason.

17:46.652 --> 17:49.370
Beatress, I think we need
to talk about this.

17:49.531 --> 17:51.570
I know.
It's crazy to think that anybody

17:51.731 --> 17:54.851
has that much disposable income,
but I love her.

17:55.012 --> 17:57.131
I just don't want
to see her suffer any more.

17:59.131 --> 18:01.170
Yeah, she's really suffering.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.810
Tessa, honey, don't be a cunt.

18:02.972 --> 18:06.211
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about that.

18:06.371 --> 18:08.491
She's at that difficult age where
if she's not high all the time,

18:08.652 --> 18:11.451
she's just a little bitch
to everybody.

18:15.131 --> 18:18.970
Ten thousand dollars,
and two for showing up.

18:19.131 --> 18:22.611
- Hm. That's one less tit job this year.
- Shut the fuck up, Tessa.

18:22.772 --> 18:25.891
I don't see why you have to pay for it.
She's already had a billion dollars

18:26.052 --> 18:29.211
worth of surgery. Why doesn't her bitch
pay for it like all the other ones?

18:31.132 --> 18:32.891
Tessa, if you're not nice
to Auntie and her friends,

18:33.052 --> 18:35.811
it's not gonna snow
for a very long time.

18:35.973 --> 18:38.731
Like there isn't some jippo already
in your purse.

18:38.892 --> 18:41.171
What exactly does she want me to do?

18:41.331 --> 18:45.531
I think she can probably
explain it best to you herself.

18:59.813 --> 19:01.411
Hi.

19:01.572 --> 19:05.572
Oh. Hello, doctor.
Thank you so much for coming.

19:05.733 --> 19:07.931
Yeah.

19:08.092 --> 19:10.331
OK, um...

19:11.772 --> 19:14.971
So what are we doing here?

19:15.732 --> 19:16.851
Um...

19:17.012 --> 19:20.331
I don't think it's really fair that God
gets to choose what we look like

19:20.492 --> 19:23.011
on the outside, do you?

19:23.172 --> 19:26.211
I'm sorry, that's not
really a fair question.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.851
It'll probably surprise you,
but I've never had any

19:30.011 --> 19:32.891
of these surgeries
to become a sexual object.

19:33.052 --> 19:36.371
- You don't work with Beatress?
- Oh, no.

19:36.532 --> 19:39.451
I'm a fashion designer.
Ruby RealGirl designs.

19:39.611 --> 19:40.571
Oh.

19:40.732 --> 19:43.491
No one looks at dolls
in a sexual manner.

19:43.652 --> 19:48.092
- Do you know why?
- I don't know why...

19:48.892 --> 19:51.091
Guess it's 'cause they
don't have all their parts.

19:51.252 --> 19:54.092
Exactly. You understand perfectly.

19:54.253 --> 19:57.731
A doll can be naked
and never feel shy

19:57.892 --> 20:00.690
or sexualised or degraded.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.331
That's what I want.

20:03.651 --> 20:06.851
OK, I'm sorry, I'm not really
understanding you.

20:07.012 --> 20:09.891
Just take these off,

20:10.052 --> 20:13.690
and seal up this as much as possible.

20:13.851 --> 20:16.170
Take off the extra bits too.

20:19.411 --> 20:21.890
Can you excuse me for just a moment?

20:28.652 --> 20:32.450
- She really wants this?
- Oh, yes.

20:32.611 --> 20:34.731
She's dedicated her whole life to this.

20:36.251 --> 20:38.011
Something wrong?

20:39.611 --> 20:41.011
Nope.

20:54.612 --> 21:00.011
All right. I'm going to have you
count backwards from 1 00 for me.

21:02.171 --> 21:03.771
Starting now.

21:03.932 --> 21:06.850
One hundred, 99,

21:07.012 --> 21:11.931
98, 97, 96...

23:36.893 --> 23:41.612
She's gonna be sore and in a lot of
pain, mostly in the genital region.

23:41.773 --> 23:44.092
I suggest you get her something
with codeine in it.

23:44.253 --> 23:46.452
- That shouldn't be a problem.
- OK.

23:46.613 --> 23:49.052
She's at serious risk for infection
if she doesn't keep

23:49.212 --> 23:51.132
the surgical areas clean
and go see a doctor to make sure

23:51.293 --> 23:53.692
she's healing properly. An untreated
infection, something like mastitis,

23:53.853 --> 23:56.811
- could kill her.
- I have a private doctor for check-ups.

23:56.973 --> 23:59.811
- I'll take her there.
- OK. She is also gonna be very groggy.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.650
You should take her somewhere
where she can heal and rest up.

24:02.812 --> 24:05.411
And walking is going to be painful.

24:05.572 --> 24:08.410
- Thank you so much, Dr Mason.
- Oh.

24:08.571 --> 24:13.291
Please do not give my name or
information to any of your friends. OK?

24:13.453 --> 24:17.172
Oh, of course not. This was
an exceptional circumstance.

24:17.332 --> 24:18.491
Good. Good luck.

24:19.612 --> 24:24.411
Wait. What should I tell Ruby to call
you for her website when she updates

24:24.572 --> 24:27.531
- the body mod community?
- Make something up.

24:48.933 --> 24:52.091
I want you to know that
the surgery was a complete success.

24:52.252 --> 24:54.171
The scarring should be minimal.

24:54.332 --> 24:58.131
But I'm gonna prescribe you with
scar reduction gel to ensure that.

24:58.293 --> 25:01.852
You may still be feeling a stretching
or pulling sensation

25:02.013 --> 25:05.412
near the incision area,
and that is perfectly normal.

25:05.573 --> 25:08.811
I'm also gonna book an appointment for
you to see your doctor in two weeks,

25:08.973 --> 25:11.292
just to make sure everything's
healing properly.

25:11.453 --> 25:13.011
Good.

25:17.852 --> 25:20.732
Miss Mason, would you please go
tell the family in the waiting room

25:20.893 --> 25:22.971
their father's had a heart attack.

25:27.933 --> 25:29.491
Residents, what do we know?

25:29.652 --> 25:32.931
One of the most important parts of the
healing process is the relationship

25:33.092 --> 25:35.052
the patient feels with their doctor.

25:35.213 --> 25:38.171
A good, composed and confident
bedside manner can be the difference

25:38.332 --> 25:41.932
between a frightened patient
and a calm and confident patient.

25:42.092 --> 25:44.812
Assess what they need to hear
and then tell that to them

25:44.972 --> 25:47.291
in a reassuring manner.
How did that go, Miss Mason?

25:47.452 --> 25:50.292
- They were upset.
- Understandably so.

25:50.452 --> 25:52.572
I want you to go back there
and tell them that he died.

25:58.653 --> 26:01.372
Hone this skill, because it's something
you'll need perfected.

26:01.533 --> 26:04.892
Especially by the time you have
to start delivering bad news.

26:05.573 --> 26:08.052
All right, people, we have rounds to do.
Quick ten minute break,

26:08.213 --> 26:10.252
then I expect to see everyone
back here bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

26:10.413 --> 26:12.972
and ready to take on new patients.
Thank you.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.692
I'm very impressed with
what I've been seeing, Mary.

26:23.853 --> 26:27.092
I can't wait to see how you perform
when you start cutting into people.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.972
You're gonna be a great slasher.

26:29.133 --> 26:31.451
- Pardon me?
- Sometimes we call surgeons slashers.

26:31.613 --> 26:34.012
You must have heard that.
You do develop a grim sense of humour

26:34.173 --> 26:36.292
when you cut into people
on a daily basis.

26:36.453 --> 26:39.652
And the adrenaline rush you get
from slicing into a human being

26:39.814 --> 26:42.892
may help you through
your most sleep-deprived days.

26:43.053 --> 26:45.052
Works better than espresso.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.212
I'm at the hospital doing
a residency programme

26:49.373 --> 26:50.652
with Dr Walsh.

26:50.813 --> 26:53.772
- Dr Grant?
- No, Dr Walsh.

26:53.934 --> 26:55.852
He's the resident surgeon
who's teaching us.

26:56.012 --> 26:59.813
Oh, good. I caught you at a good time.

26:59.974 --> 27:03.092
- How are you, sweetie?
- Um...

27:03.253 --> 27:06.452
Nana, would you mind if I gave you
a call back when I get home?

27:06.613 --> 27:10.653
OK, sweetheart. You just don't
worry about me, OK?

27:14.013 --> 27:17.052
Can I help you? Beatress.

27:18.933 --> 27:20.133
What are you doing here?

27:21.054 --> 27:23.533
Oh. You said not to call.

27:23.694 --> 27:26.372
Showing up is worse than calling.

27:26.533 --> 27:29.051
By a lot.

27:29.212 --> 27:32.012
- How did you find me?
- Oh, I just looked up the name

27:32.173 --> 27:34.812
of your school on your resume,
and then I called your school to find out

27:34.973 --> 27:38.093
where the hospital was at that you
were doing your residency.

27:38.253 --> 27:41.173
And then I just decided to come here
and show up and wait.

27:41.334 --> 27:43.412
What is this?

27:44.814 --> 27:46.891
- You do know what it is, then.
- Mm-hm.

27:47.053 --> 27:48.692
- OK.
- Ruby designed it for you special.

27:48.853 --> 27:51.372
She wanted to say thank you.
She was gonna drop it off herself,

27:51.533 --> 27:55.453
but I said I'd deliver it.
I know you don't want strange looks.

27:55.614 --> 27:57.732
Yeah...

27:57.893 --> 28:01.532
Well, tell her thank you for me.
Truly.

28:01.692 --> 28:05.171
- She really didn't have to do that.
- Oh, she wanted to do it.

28:05.332 --> 28:07.491
To say thank you.
You should check out her website,

28:07.652 --> 28:10.052
she puts up all kinds
of new pictures.

28:17.013 --> 28:18.611
I bet you're glad
Ruby didn't show up.

28:18.772 --> 28:21.692
- Yeah. I'm gonna go now.
- OK.

28:21.852 --> 28:24.572
If you ever want to get together
for coffee or something, sometime,

28:24.732 --> 28:27.611
- just girls' night...
- OK. I'll keep that in mind.

28:27.772 --> 28:29.692
- OK.
- OK.

28:29.853 --> 28:31.572
My treat.

28:33.053 --> 28:35.291
- Festivities. It's gonna be...
- Festivities.

28:40.133 --> 28:42.092
I couldn't find any patients
needing surgery on the break,

28:42.253 --> 28:45.532
- so I grabbed a coffee instead.
- Ah, surgeon humour.

28:45.693 --> 28:48.532
I was honestly looking.
How was your break, Mary?

28:48.693 --> 28:49.812
- Good.
- Good.

28:49.972 --> 28:53.772
Mary, I'd like to talk to you about
something without the others around.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.451
- What?
- Some of the surgeons

28:56.613 --> 28:58.811
from the hospital are getting together
tonight for drinks.

28:58.973 --> 29:01.932
We're wondering if you'd
be able to attend.

29:02.093 --> 29:05.331
For drinks? With... other surgeons?

29:05.492 --> 29:07.852
Yes, at Dr Grant's home.
Do you have the address?

29:08.013 --> 29:11.172
No. I don't have the address.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.253
I'll email it to you.
You'll come then?

29:13.414 --> 29:16.372
I would love to.
Does he know you're inviting me?

29:16.533 --> 29:18.052
It was his idea.

29:18.213 --> 29:20.772
Come around ten. We should have
everything at a good pace by then.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.531
- OK.
- Good.

29:22.693 --> 29:24.652
Come on, we have rounds to do.
Cunts and runts.

30:52.494 --> 30:56.533
- You must be Mary Mason.
- Good guess.

30:56.693 --> 30:59.132
- Why don't you come in?
- Thank you.

31:02.134 --> 31:04.652
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

31:15.294 --> 31:19.533
- Here we are. Hm.
- Wow. It's beautiful.

31:20.413 --> 31:22.293
I'll go get us some drinks.

31:22.454 --> 31:24.373
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

31:35.413 --> 31:38.693
- Mary Mason.
- Thank you.

31:38.854 --> 31:42.652
- I feel like I know you from somewhere.
- What did you say your name was?

31:42.813 --> 31:44.933
Have a drink.

31:50.174 --> 31:54.612
- Um, are you a surgeon at the hospital?
- I'm a fuckin' motherfucker.

31:57.773 --> 32:01.452
No, seriously, babe,
I cut people up for a living.

32:02.733 --> 32:05.932
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

32:06.092 --> 32:08.372
- Dr Black, I see you've met Mary.
- Hi.

32:09.453 --> 32:11.132
I'm done, Walsh.

32:11.813 --> 32:14.092
- Enjoy the party, sweetie.
- Thank you.

32:15.253 --> 32:17.492
Hi, Dr Walsh.
It's so great to see you.

32:17.653 --> 32:19.292
- How are you?
- Very well, Mary. Thank you.

32:19.453 --> 32:23.052
It's so nice you were able to attend.
What a pretty dress.

32:23.214 --> 32:26.212
- Things must be paying well.
- It was a gift from a friend.

32:26.373 --> 32:28.172
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

32:28.333 --> 32:30.652
Have some drinks.
Everyone's all over the place.

32:30.813 --> 32:33.371
Some men are out in this area
using it as, I don't know,

32:33.532 --> 32:36.892
some sort of a lobby. And everyone else
is in the other rooms.

32:37.053 --> 32:38.573
I'll go let Dr Grant
know that you're here.

32:38.733 --> 32:39.972
Thank you.

32:51.493 --> 32:55.133
Well, I hope you finished all your
studying before you came here.

32:55.294 --> 32:57.453
Dr Walsh runs us
pretty hard in rounds,

32:57.614 --> 33:00.132
so if you don't learn to cram it all in,
you fall behind.

33:00.293 --> 33:01.492
Mm-hm.

33:02.213 --> 33:04.812
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:08.933 --> 33:12.092
- Don't fuck up.
- I don't intend to.

33:12.253 --> 33:15.733
- I've been working very hard.
- And?

33:15.893 --> 33:19.452
- And I won't fuck up.
- No. Never.

33:19.613 --> 33:22.892
Everything else is forgivable
if the work is good.

33:24.413 --> 33:26.692
You mean, like, as a person?

33:26.854 --> 33:29.533
I never... thought of it like that.

33:30.654 --> 33:32.572
Isn't the work just as much
a part of yourself?

33:34.054 --> 33:35.453
What do you think, Mary?

33:36.534 --> 33:38.773
I don't really know.

33:39.493 --> 33:41.532
You have to think for yourself, Mary.

33:41.693 --> 33:44.012
No one is gonna hold your hand
through this life.

33:45.334 --> 33:48.692
Everyone here is just
out for themselves.

33:50.733 --> 33:53.052
So how are those turkeys coming along?

33:53.213 --> 33:57.693
Quite well. It's really helping me
with my suturing technique.

33:57.853 --> 34:00.492
Yeah. It's an old pro's secret.

34:00.653 --> 34:02.853
Let me just take that for you, Mary.

34:03.014 --> 34:05.853
Hope our party's matching up well
to the ones you usually attend.

34:06.014 --> 34:10.612
I don't usually attend parties
with doctors and surgeons.

34:10.774 --> 34:12.893
We do do things a little differently.

34:16.534 --> 34:18.533
- He's kind of odd.
- Mm-hm.

34:19.134 --> 34:20.891
Most microsurgeons are.

34:21.974 --> 34:24.413
Did you know in his spare time he likes
to paint people being eaten

34:24.574 --> 34:27.373
by different animals?
Usually a bear.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.292
You're kidding.

34:30.654 --> 34:31.733
Oh, no, I'm not.

34:32.974 --> 34:35.612
I would never kid about something
as fucked up as that.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.092
I hate people who
exaggerate their stories

34:37.253 --> 34:39.612
just to make them sound
more interesting.

34:40.574 --> 34:44.893
So, Mary, I noticed that you
were doing better financially.

34:45.054 --> 34:48.333
Nice new clothes,
brand-new stethoscope.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.853
I never thought I'd see you
at one of these.

34:54.215 --> 34:56.411
- I'm sorry, what?
- Whoa, whoa...

34:59.094 --> 35:01.614
- I don't feel good.
- Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

35:01.774 --> 35:06.134
OK, OK. Maybe you just need to lay down
on your back for a moment.

35:06.894 --> 35:08.334
Hm? Whoa, whoa.

35:11.374 --> 35:14.132
- That would be good.
- There you go.

35:14.294 --> 35:15.734
- No good.
- Oops.

35:15.894 --> 35:18.293
Just keep going. There you go.

35:18.454 --> 35:20.893
Lay down on a nice bed here,
you'll feel much better.

35:22.174 --> 35:25.213
Take it easy, take it easy. OK.

35:25.374 --> 35:27.853
Let's go this way, come on. Come on.

35:28.014 --> 35:30.973
Just turn yourself around.
There you go.

35:31.134 --> 35:32.733
Lay down.

35:42.855 --> 35:46.653
Let's make you nice and comfy.

35:46.814 --> 35:48.533
OK?

36:02.173 --> 36:03.813
Relax!

36:32.573 --> 36:34.693
You are so pretty.

36:43.654 --> 36:45.093
So pretty.

39:31.455 --> 39:33.374
Lobby.

40:08.135 --> 40:09.334
Wanna make five grand?

41:02.814 --> 41:06.613
Let me know when you're done.
Lance and I'll come back to get him, OK?

41:07.574 --> 41:10.053
No, you can just go home.

41:10.214 --> 41:13.693
I won't be done till tomorrow night.

41:16.935 --> 41:18.373
All right.

41:20.055 --> 41:21.614
Just give me a call.

42:24.295 --> 42:26.933
I quit med school today.

42:29.695 --> 42:32.654
That shouldn't come
as a surprise to you.

42:35.174 --> 42:38.974
I'm guessing you thought
I went into prostitution.

42:39.135 --> 42:42.493
That's why you invited me
to the party last night.

42:46.974 --> 42:49.014
I didn't.

43:07.775 --> 43:09.613
Please hold still.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.574
Is your jaw numb?

43:38.455 --> 43:41.454
I'm changing specialties, Dr Grant.

43:42.815 --> 43:46.334
Have you ever heard
of body modification?

43:48.855 --> 43:50.494
Neither had I.

43:51.975 --> 43:55.733
Anyway, you know how
you're always, always

43:55.895 --> 43:58.934
telling me that surgeons

43:59.094 --> 44:01.934
can't make any mistakes?

44:02.095 --> 44:06.813
So... in the spirit of practice,

44:06.974 --> 44:09.893
I've come up with a little list...

44:11.614 --> 44:16.373
...of the most popular procedures
that we are going to try on you...

44:16.534 --> 44:18.173
...tonight.

44:19.294 --> 44:23.054
So... we have...

44:23.215 --> 44:25.614
...tongue splitting.

44:25.775 --> 44:27.774
I know.

44:27.935 --> 44:33.534
Implants, sometimes referred to
as 3D implants.

44:35.415 --> 44:37.334
Teeth filing.

44:39.214 --> 44:41.653
Genital modification.

44:41.815 --> 44:46.053
And voluntary amputation.

44:46.214 --> 44:49.534
So, I think we should get started.

44:49.694 --> 44:53.533
We have at least 14 hours
of surgery ahead of us.

44:54.335 --> 44:56.733
I would like to get it all done
in one session.

44:56.894 --> 45:02.374
So just going to grab
your little tongue right here.

45:02.535 --> 45:04.334
Isn't this fun?

45:04.495 --> 45:08.014
I'm still learning from you.

45:30.815 --> 45:33.014
I'd say that's healing very nicely.

45:33.174 --> 45:36.334
- I fucking love it.
- You wear it very well.

45:36.495 --> 45:38.214
It was very nice to see you again, Dru.

45:38.375 --> 45:41.533
If there's anything I can do to help you
express yourself any further,

45:41.694 --> 45:43.295
- let me know.
- Thank you very much, doctor.

45:43.455 --> 45:44.974
Have a great day.

45:49.176 --> 45:52.814
- That's fucking gnarly.
- What's fucking gnarly?

45:52.975 --> 45:54.054
Oh.

45:54.655 --> 45:55.933
Genital modification.

45:57.655 --> 46:01.054
There are more procedures available
than there are in the book.

46:01.215 --> 46:04.614
- He must have been hard-core.
- He was. Yes.

46:04.775 --> 46:07.334
Very... hard-core.

46:09.735 --> 46:12.974
I also put together this mod menu.

46:13.135 --> 46:15.814
Maybe it'll help you channel
your creativity.

46:15.974 --> 46:17.053
Henrik, the last time we spoke,

46:17.214 --> 46:19.294
you talked about wanting
to become more unique.

46:19.455 --> 46:22.215
Has anything in the album inspired
any further thoughts on this?

46:22.376 --> 46:25.573
I was thinking about maybe getting some
tribal scarring and some piercings.

46:25.735 --> 46:27.734
Piercings.

46:28.855 --> 46:30.294
- Get out.
- What?

46:30.456 --> 46:32.735
Just get the fuck out.

46:32.896 --> 46:36.054
You 20-year-old Satanist-wannabe reject.

46:36.215 --> 46:37.855
Does it look like
I do piercings in here?

46:38.016 --> 46:41.934
Did you see an advertisement somewhere
for piercings with my name on it?

46:42.095 --> 46:44.454
- No.
- Lance!

47:02.976 --> 47:04.815
Hi. Excuse me, miss.

47:04.976 --> 47:06.935
You Mary Mason?

47:07.096 --> 47:09.894
- Who are you?
- I'm Detective Dolor, Mary.

47:10.055 --> 47:12.734
I'm investigating the disappearance
of Dr Alan Grant.

47:12.896 --> 47:15.014
The disappearance?

47:15.175 --> 47:16.935
That's terrible.

47:17.096 --> 47:19.175
I haven't seen him
since I left med school.

47:19.335 --> 47:21.455
He didn't really seem like
the kind of guy who'd just vanish,

47:21.616 --> 47:25.335
but, again, I didn't really know him.

47:25.495 --> 47:29.214
Well, he wasn't the sort of guy who
seemed to be a lot of things he was.

47:30.175 --> 47:32.094
We found a lot of questionable things,

47:32.255 --> 47:34.335
things of a deviant sexual nature.

47:36.696 --> 47:39.374
- I'd never have guessed.
- Yeah.

47:40.256 --> 47:43.576
Anyway, a guy called Dr Walsh
gave us a shortlist of girls

47:43.736 --> 47:46.215
that Dr Grant may have given a reason
to have something against him.

47:46.935 --> 47:49.815
- You were mentioned on that list.
- In what sense?

47:49.976 --> 47:52.775
Just we should talk to you, that's all.

47:52.935 --> 47:55.974
Why do you think you'd be on that list?

47:56.135 --> 47:58.454
I really have no idea.

48:00.095 --> 48:02.774
He was a tough instructor,
I suppose people could have thought

48:02.934 --> 48:05.214
- he was picking on me, but...
- Yeah, that's quite similar

48:05.375 --> 48:07.534
to what we've been hearing
about your relationship.

48:08.935 --> 48:12.454
So, if you do think of anything,
give me a call.

48:13.535 --> 48:15.414
- I'll be in touch.
- OK.

48:16.815 --> 48:19.774
- Look after yourself.
- Thanks.

48:28.536 --> 48:29.494
Titties and shrimp?

48:35.615 --> 48:36.854
Whoo!

48:37.015 --> 48:38.774
All right!

48:38.935 --> 48:40.534
Come on!

48:40.695 --> 48:43.775
Hey, come on! At least you get to see
some fucking tits!

48:53.535 --> 48:56.573
Hey, I don't know if I entirely trust
the shrimp we make.

50:56.415 --> 50:57.575
How's the shrimp?

50:59.736 --> 51:03.215
- What?
- I asked you how the shrimp was.

51:04.015 --> 51:04.934
Oh.

51:05.095 --> 51:08.335
Uh... What are you doing here?
I thought you had an appointment.

51:08.495 --> 51:12.495
I did. The guy was completely vanilla,
had no idea what he wanted.

51:12.656 --> 51:16.095
- He was asking me for piercings.
- I'm sorry about that.

51:18.016 --> 51:20.535
It's nice to know that after a long day
you like to come visit me.

51:20.696 --> 51:22.975
I'm not here to see you.

51:23.137 --> 51:25.655
Beatress...

51:26.896 --> 51:30.536
...won't stop bothering me
to go out for coffee or something.

51:30.696 --> 51:33.335
I had to make it stop.
Why, do you...

51:34.656 --> 51:37.256
...have a job for me or something?

51:37.417 --> 51:40.175
Cutting? Sewing?

51:41.136 --> 51:43.296
No, Mary.

51:44.257 --> 51:47.295
We just don't torture people
like we used to.

51:47.456 --> 51:50.576
People don't make you mad any more?

51:50.736 --> 51:52.935
No, they make me mad. Just...

51:53.095 --> 51:54.814
...not the same kind of mad.

51:56.815 --> 52:00.054
- People still make me mad.
- Someone bothering you?

52:01.455 --> 52:05.615
Oh, a detective came to talk to me
about Dr Grant today.

52:06.816 --> 52:09.934
- What does he know?
- Nothing.

52:11.735 --> 52:14.494
Although, he probably wouldn't be
talking to me if Dr Walsh

52:14.655 --> 52:16.735
didn't tell him to talk to me.

52:16.896 --> 52:19.375
Who's Dr Walsh?

52:19.535 --> 52:22.495
Another instructor from med school.

52:23.296 --> 52:28.375
I don't know what he knows,
because I blacked out.

52:39.936 --> 52:41.214
You want me to take
care of it for you?

52:42.936 --> 52:45.975
No. Thank you.

52:46.135 --> 52:48.135
Very nice of you to ask.

52:49.975 --> 52:51.775
Offer's on the table.

52:53.775 --> 52:55.855
I'm gonna go see if Beatress is ready.

52:56.015 --> 52:58.015
- Yeah, go on in.
- See ya.

53:00.135 --> 53:03.694
I want you to know, if you're taking me
someplace to kill me, I will fight back.

53:03.855 --> 53:06.774
You're hilarious, Mary.

53:06.936 --> 53:09.415
No, I got a surprise for you.

53:09.576 --> 53:12.295
I think you'll get a kick out of it.

53:12.456 --> 53:16.296
You don't want to go to places
I get a kick out of going to.

53:16.456 --> 53:18.695
That might work with the thugs
at the Bourbon A Go Go,

53:18.856 --> 53:20.815
but you don't scare me, Dr Mason.

53:20.975 --> 53:23.775
- The thugs at Bourbon are scared of me?
- Mm-hm.

53:23.936 --> 53:25.374
Even Billy.

53:26.376 --> 53:28.255
I must be a monster.

53:28.416 --> 53:30.974
You're not. You're a creative artist.

53:31.135 --> 53:34.175
And no one ever understands artists
and their work.

53:34.336 --> 53:36.094
Usually you have to wait
till you're dead.

53:36.255 --> 53:38.495
Then everyone goes around saying
what geniuses you are.

53:41.536 --> 53:43.455
Ruby's been out of town
for a little while.

53:43.616 --> 53:45.694
But she wanted me
to give you something.

53:47.216 --> 53:49.855
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

53:50.016 --> 53:53.695
She gets bored very easily.
She's a very strange girl.

54:04.296 --> 54:06.575
I didn't know Ruby had a boyfriend.

54:08.896 --> 54:10.455
She has many.

54:10.616 --> 54:12.535
That's of her husband.

54:18.656 --> 54:20.815
I found what I was looking for.

54:20.976 --> 54:24.575
- What is it?
- It's your Sistine Chapel.

54:24.736 --> 54:26.575
Looks like something that could have
been sent over email.

54:26.736 --> 54:30.335
Hm. They run the largest body modification
website in the world.

54:30.495 --> 54:32.375
- Abstrakt.me.
- I've heard of it.

54:32.536 --> 54:35.775
'Course you have. They also have
a magazine by the same name

54:35.936 --> 54:39.376
and they feature all kind
of strange and wonderful things.

54:39.537 --> 54:43.935
They want you to work on them ever
since they saw the work you did on Ruby.

54:44.096 --> 54:46.815
- They want me to work on them?
- Mm-hm.

54:47.297 --> 54:49.215
They're gonna be in town for one week.

54:49.376 --> 54:53.216
I'm sure Billy wouldn't mind you
using his office to meet with them.

54:56.016 --> 54:59.256
- Thanks for this, Beatress.
- Good luck.

56:07.215 --> 56:09.815
May I offer either one of you a drink?

56:09.976 --> 56:14.255
- Candy apple martini.
- I'll have the same.

56:15.135 --> 56:18.575
- Nothing for me, thanks.
- Oh, come on. Don't make us drink alone.

56:18.736 --> 56:20.616
I'll have the same.

56:31.177 --> 56:35.215
Oh. Ruby. Very pleased
with how she worked out.

56:35.376 --> 56:38.015
Is that how you found me?
Through her website?

56:38.176 --> 56:41.295
How we first heard about your work, ja.

56:41.456 --> 56:45.735
Finding you was a different matter.
Your work is easily accessible online.

56:45.896 --> 56:49.215
You might say you're somewhat
of a celebrity.

56:49.376 --> 56:51.375
Bloody Mary.

56:52.896 --> 56:55.535
Bloody Mary? That's online?

56:55.696 --> 56:58.495
Don't worry. We would
never dream of betraying our

56:58.656 --> 57:03.455
doctor-patient confidentiality
by giving out your full name.

57:03.616 --> 57:06.175
But we will be asked
about our procedure.

57:06.336 --> 57:08.215
People will have lots of questions.

57:08.376 --> 57:10.295
You should get
a website for your work.

57:10.456 --> 57:12.495
We can take care of that for you.

57:16.976 --> 57:20.735
Consider it a thank you gift
for agreeing to see us.

57:20.896 --> 57:26.375
Do you feel... connected
to anyone, Mary?

57:27.456 --> 57:29.495
No.

57:29.656 --> 57:32.175
Most people attracted
to this culture don't.

57:32.337 --> 57:37.216
At least you can feel
connected to yourself.

57:37.377 --> 57:40.896
I guess everybody feels
connected to themselves.

57:41.056 --> 57:43.136
Ja und nein.

57:44.296 --> 57:48.775
I have the benefit of being connected
to myself...

57:50.616 --> 57:52.896
...und my sister.

57:53.056 --> 57:58.656
But I know that connection may
or may not last beyond this existence.

57:59.697 --> 58:02.216
We never want to lose
that connection, Mary.

58:02.377 --> 58:06.656
Maybe we'll die together and face
whatever's to come together.

58:08.576 --> 58:10.495
Maybe not.

58:10.656 --> 58:14.175
But should anything ever happen
to one of us before the other,

58:14.336 --> 58:16.736
we never want to lose that connection.

58:16.897 --> 58:20.215
We want you to take off our left arms
and exchange them with one another.

58:21.856 --> 58:23.456
That shouldn't be a problem.

58:27.737 --> 58:33.496
We also want you to strengthen
our connection with ourself.

58:35.018 --> 58:38.335
It's a bit more complicated
than an appendage exchange

58:38.497 --> 58:42.936
and somewhat difficult to put
into words, but we feel that image

58:43.097 --> 58:48.256
best describes the
reflection we... desire.

58:48.417 --> 58:52.096
Of course, the amount you need
for compensation is not an issue.

58:54.017 --> 58:55.936
How's Friday?

59:13.857 --> 59:17.657
- What's that?
- It's my blueprint.

59:23.977 --> 59:27.456
- Goddamn waste of time, if you ask me.
- I didn't.

59:27.617 --> 59:30.175
Thank you for letting me use your club.

59:31.297 --> 59:33.017
Don't mention it.

59:38.377 --> 59:39.817
I need help.

59:41.777 --> 59:44.216
You ain't kidding.

59:44.377 --> 59:46.736
It's a big job, they need to be
operated on at the same time.

59:46.897 --> 59:48.736
Do you know anyone that's good?

59:51.415 --> 59:54.775
I know someone that's just awful.

59:54.936 --> 59:56.495
Who owes me.

01:00:00.736 --> 01:00:02.216
Thanks.

01:00:06.696 --> 01:00:08.256
Don't mention it.

01:00:17.817 --> 01:00:19.615
Yeah, that's good.

01:00:21.656 --> 01:00:24.936
When you wake up,
you will be connected to yourselves,

01:00:25.097 --> 01:00:26.776
and to each other.

01:00:26.936 --> 01:00:29.215
Thank you, doctor.

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:36.015
Now, I would like you...

01:00:36.176 --> 01:00:40.095
...to close your eyes, breathe deeply,
count backwards from 1 00.

01:00:40.256 --> 01:00:42.416
Just relax,

01:00:42.576 --> 01:00:45.055
and it should take effect immediately.

01:01:00.097 --> 01:01:01.056
What's that?

01:01:01.217 --> 01:01:03.376
- Twins, ja?
- Yeah.

01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:35.136
Hello, Dr Grant.

01:03:36.777 --> 01:03:38.377
It's been a while.

01:03:39.698 --> 01:03:41.136
Mm-hm.

01:03:42.657 --> 01:03:44.377
Oh, what's that?

01:03:44.538 --> 01:03:47.657
I couldn't hear you
'cause your mouth is sewn shut.

01:03:49.018 --> 01:03:50.576
I know.

01:03:51.777 --> 01:03:55.656
Yes, you must be terribly
uncomfortable.

01:03:55.816 --> 01:03:59.497
We're just gonna take a few pictures
of you today.

01:04:01.176 --> 01:04:03.935
For my website. Mm-hm.

01:04:05.617 --> 01:04:07.936
For my brand-new website.

01:04:08.097 --> 01:04:11.496
Because everyone needs
their own website these days.

01:04:11.657 --> 01:04:15.816
And they can scan these or something.

01:04:17.697 --> 01:04:20.096
That one probably could
have been done better.

01:04:20.257 --> 01:04:22.976
Looks a little bit infected.

01:04:26.497 --> 01:04:27.857
Well...

01:04:30.016 --> 01:04:33.496
That one healed nicely, though.

01:04:34.097 --> 01:04:36.856
You really should have seen it tonight.

01:04:38.017 --> 01:04:40.496
My work is getting
consistently stronger.

01:04:41.337 --> 01:04:44.376
Comparatively to the work
I've done on you.

01:04:44.537 --> 01:04:48.096
It's rather crude, but then again...

01:04:50.498 --> 01:04:54.016
...you were never something I was
excessively proud of before, were you?

01:04:58.977 --> 01:05:00.777
Oh, really.

01:05:00.938 --> 01:05:03.056
So unattractive.

01:05:05.657 --> 01:05:08.256
So...

01:05:14.497 --> 01:05:18.577
What we're going to do with you today?

01:05:21.577 --> 01:05:26.056
I have been asking myself
why your right ear still exists.

01:05:29.377 --> 01:05:30.657
Hm...

01:05:31.697 --> 01:05:33.817
That one's not very good.

01:05:35.138 --> 01:05:39.776
Maybe redo that one
on the other side.

01:05:40.898 --> 01:05:44.176
Practice makes perfect,
and surgeons...

01:05:44.337 --> 01:05:46.656
...or whatever it is I do now,

01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:49.617
can't afford to make mistakes.

01:05:54.378 --> 01:05:56.136
Hm...

01:06:01.418 --> 01:06:03.776
That definitely needs to go.

01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:13.696
Oh, man, what the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

01:06:15.298 --> 01:06:16.897
It's OK, dude.

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:20.177
I'm gonna get you down, OK?
I'm gonna call the fucking cops.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.137
OK.

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:28.257
Fuck!

01:06:29.137 --> 01:06:31.297
Fuck!

01:06:56.738 --> 01:06:59.137
Jesus fuck!

01:07:49.537 --> 01:07:51.056
Fuck.

01:07:54.457 --> 01:07:56.976
Hey, Lance, can you give
Mary a call, please? I missed it.

01:09:12.578 --> 01:09:14.577
I figured you hadn't eaten.

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:17.057
So I picked up a few options.

01:09:17.218 --> 01:09:19.178
Not sure what you're in the mood for.

01:09:36.058 --> 01:09:37.017
You upset?

01:09:38.817 --> 01:09:40.857
Of course I'm upset.

01:09:41.018 --> 01:09:42.496
About the two dead guys?

01:09:43.858 --> 01:09:45.015
It affects me.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:53.977
A few years back, this fucking kid
breaks into my mom's house.

01:09:56.059 --> 01:09:58.457
One of those B and E motherfuckers.

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:02.737
She hears somebody downstairs, and...

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:06.657
...she grabs her umbrella,
and heads on down.

01:10:08.298 --> 01:10:12.057
What the fuck she thought she was gonna
do with that umbrella I'll never know.

01:10:13.698 --> 01:10:16.417
But she heads downstairs,

01:10:16.578 --> 01:10:19.937
and he grabs the fucking umbrella,

01:10:20.098 --> 01:10:23.297
and beats the fucking shit
out of her with the goddamn thing.

01:10:25.858 --> 01:10:27.777
Punctures her eye socket,

01:10:27.938 --> 01:10:30.097
fractures her jaw,

01:10:30.258 --> 01:10:32.378
breaks three of her ribs.

01:10:33.338 --> 01:10:36.497
And the little fucker kicks her cell
phone just far enough out of her reach

01:10:36.658 --> 01:10:39.417
so she can't call for help.

01:10:39.578 --> 01:10:41.537
And then he leaves her there to die.

01:10:42.978 --> 01:10:44.537
They find her three days later.

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:47.777
She's in the hospital
for four fucking months.

01:10:47.938 --> 01:10:50.218
What I wouldn't give
to have known you back then

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:52.937
when I found that little motherfucker.

01:10:56.978 --> 01:10:59.737
Don't you ever
devalue what you do, Mary.

01:10:59.898 --> 01:11:01.537
You make sure they deserve it,

01:11:01.698 --> 01:11:05.057
and don't waste a minute of your time
thinking about them after you're done.

01:11:11.339 --> 01:11:13.577
Is that a milkshake?

01:11:13.739 --> 01:11:16.098
I got chocolate and vanilla.

01:11:18.339 --> 01:11:20.538
You don't seem like a vanilla.

01:11:32.298 --> 01:11:34.058
Thank you, Lance.

01:11:38.978 --> 01:11:40.698
It's really good.

01:11:54.338 --> 01:11:56.377
Good morning, ladies.

01:12:21.218 --> 01:12:25.658
This is about you and how you
can best express yourself to the world.

01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:28.337
There are numerous procedures
outlined here, but please,

01:12:28.498 --> 01:12:30.217
don't feel limited to them.

01:12:30.378 --> 01:12:34.097
The most important thing is that
you're happy and comfortable

01:12:34.258 --> 01:12:36.097
with yourself.

01:12:36.258 --> 01:12:38.537
I know you may have come up against
some harsh criticisms

01:12:38.699 --> 01:12:40.217
and judgments in the past.

01:12:40.378 --> 01:12:43.857
But you can feel confident that you're
free of all such notions here.

01:12:44.018 --> 01:12:47.177
I can assure you that you'll
receive your procedure

01:12:47.338 --> 01:12:49.857
in a safe and supportive environment.

01:12:50.018 --> 01:12:52.018
And at a reasonable cost.

01:12:52.178 --> 01:12:55.257
It is difficult to put a price
on feeling complete, though.

01:12:55.418 --> 01:12:56.337
Isn't it?

01:12:56.498 --> 01:12:58.257
You know what I'd really like
to have done next, Mary?

01:12:59.979 --> 01:13:01.577
Pull your pants up now.

01:13:01.738 --> 01:13:05.217
I will give you some antibiotics.
It should clear that up for you.

01:13:05.378 --> 01:13:07.537
I thought when you said "no sex"
it meant no sex.

01:13:07.698 --> 01:13:10.658
- Not masturbation as well.
- Well, you would think common sense

01:13:10.818 --> 01:13:12.897
would tell you that masturbating
during the healing process

01:13:13.058 --> 01:13:15.937
could result in some tearing of skin.
But...

01:13:16.098 --> 01:13:18.337
...guess I wasn't clear enough with you,
penis guy.

01:13:20.458 --> 01:13:22.057
Excuse me.

01:13:22.217 --> 01:13:25.297
- Hello?
- Hi, Mary? It's Detective Dolor.

01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:28.338
I was wondering if I could come up
for a bit and have a word.

01:13:28.499 --> 01:13:30.658
Of course.

01:13:30.819 --> 01:13:34.297
You need to leave right now. Yep.
Gotta go. Thanks. Oh!

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:37.497
- Pills, jacket on you.
- Thanks. So if I take these,

01:13:37.659 --> 01:13:38.778
- it'll clear up?
- Yep. Mm-hm.

01:13:38.938 --> 01:13:41.857
Absolutely clear it up.
Just leave it alone.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:44.417
- OK.
- OK. Out you go.

01:13:46.658 --> 01:13:49.017
- I'll call you when I'm healed up.
- OK.

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:26.018
Hello, detective.

01:14:27.339 --> 01:14:29.738
Was that your boyfriend?

01:14:29.899 --> 01:14:31.298
One of them.

01:14:34.699 --> 01:14:36.257
Lovely new place.

01:14:36.418 --> 01:14:38.978
It's much nicer an area
than the last place, eh?

01:14:39.139 --> 01:14:40.778
I like it.

01:14:42.139 --> 01:14:44.898
Can I get you a glass of water
or something?

01:14:45.059 --> 01:14:46.498
Sure. Yeah.

01:14:48.699 --> 01:14:50.577
So did they find Dr Grant yet?

01:14:50.739 --> 01:14:52.737
Not exactly, no.

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:56.698
Now we can't seem to locate
Dr Walsh either.

01:14:58.338 --> 01:15:01.298
Really? That's awful.

01:15:01.459 --> 01:15:03.658
Did he have anything to do
with Dr Grant's disappearance?

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:06.698
No, but they are related.

01:15:06.858 --> 01:15:09.778
You see, these two doctors were involved
in hosting sex parties.

01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:12.498
The girls involved were drugged
and videotaped.

01:15:12.659 --> 01:15:16.378
- Did you know about this?
- No.

01:15:17.418 --> 01:15:20.058
I think you do, Mary.

01:15:20.219 --> 01:15:22.618
All those girls Dr Walsh mentioned
were on the tapes.

01:15:27.859 --> 01:15:29.178
Was I on the tape?

01:15:39.499 --> 01:15:41.098
No.

01:15:41.259 --> 01:15:43.618
But I do think you were
at one of those parties.

01:15:44.819 --> 01:15:49.058
And I think Dr Grant is a monster,
and that he really hurt you.

01:15:50.338 --> 01:15:53.897
You're the victim here, Mary,
but I can't help you at all

01:15:54.058 --> 01:15:56.257
if you won't let me.

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:58.617
- Come on. How close am I?
- You know what?

01:15:58.778 --> 01:16:02.177
There's a terrible chip in that glass.
I'm gonna get you a new one.

01:16:03.698 --> 01:16:06.817
You just wanna run away from it all,
don't you, Mary?

01:16:06.978 --> 01:16:10.617
Believe me, I do understand you,
more than you know.

01:16:15.378 --> 01:16:18.658
You know, I really don't feel
comfortable talking about this.

01:16:18.819 --> 01:16:21.618
But if anything changes,
I'll be sure to let you know.

01:16:23.818 --> 01:16:26.618
I don't want you to be
another sad story, Mary.

01:16:27.618 --> 01:16:29.537
You really think about it, yeah?

01:16:31.018 --> 01:16:33.017
Next time I see you,
I wanna know,

01:16:33.178 --> 01:16:35.418
I'm gonna to find out
what's really going on with you.

01:16:36.499 --> 01:16:38.978
There's really not all
that much to me.

01:16:40.059 --> 01:16:42.497
I find that hard to believe, Mary.

01:16:43.818 --> 01:16:45.538
Thank you for your hospitality.

01:16:47.258 --> 01:16:48.818
Goodbye, Mary.

01:17:11.219 --> 01:17:12.778
Hey, Nana.

01:17:12.939 --> 01:17:15.497
Sorry I missed your call... What?

01:18:00.979 --> 01:18:01.939
Billy?

01:18:08.779 --> 01:18:12.417
Tell me that hasn't happened before.
Go get yourself cleaned up.

01:18:13.139 --> 01:18:15.697
These new girls, you know?

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.698
They don't even bring
resumes or anything.

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:19.417
You got a minute?

01:18:19.578 --> 01:18:23.578
Yeah, Mary. For you
I have several minutes. Fuck!

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.298
You OK?

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:35.538
Dr Walsh is missing.

01:18:35.699 --> 01:18:38.819
You wouldn't happen to know anything
about that, would you?

01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:42.018
No, I don't know anything about that.

01:18:42.978 --> 01:18:45.498
All right, I might have had
something to do with it.

01:18:46.819 --> 01:18:49.379
But I had the best of intentions, Mary,
I swear.

01:18:53.299 --> 01:18:55.618
Did you find a tape of me?

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:57.858
No.

01:19:18.499 --> 01:19:22.059
You want me take care of that for you?
I owe you one.

01:19:22.659 --> 01:19:23.779
Uh...

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:26.899
- No, we're just gonna scare him.
- I can scare him.

01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:32.859
I'll let you know if I need backup.

01:19:46.539 --> 01:19:49.338
Excuse me. I need to powder my nose.

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:31.218
- Crazy night, huh?
- Yeah, pretty crazy.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.979
I'm sorry.

01:22:53.339 --> 01:22:56.099
It's not entirely personal.

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:02.819
Just the wrong place, the wrong time,
the wrong dick in your mouth.

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.579
You know what?

01:23:06.219 --> 01:23:08.299
Don't worry about it.

01:24:47.659 --> 01:24:49.298
I'm sorry.

01:25:07.819 --> 01:25:09.819
Hey, who let you in?

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.219
Sorry, miss,
we're all closed for the night.

01:25:17.219 --> 01:25:18.939
What'll it be?

01:25:42.019 --> 01:25:44.418
Do you think I'm crazy?

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:52.579
No.

01:25:56.099 --> 01:25:58.819
Someone told me that you
were afraid of me.

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:01.619
Who said that?

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.699
Is it true?

01:26:06.819 --> 01:26:08.619
No.

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.379
Beatress quit.

01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:17.058
What?

01:26:19.539 --> 01:26:22.099
Beatress. She, uh...

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.219
...stopped answering my phone calls,

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.579
she's not coming in.

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:30.339
I would have preferred a little closure,
but hey, you know?

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:33.060
That's dancers for you.

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.339
I didn't think
she had the balls for that.

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:43.379
But guess people can surprise you.

01:26:46.381 --> 01:26:48.058
You ever been to LA?

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:53.859
- No.
- You ever wanted to go to LA?

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:57.900
I was thinking I need a change of pace,
you know? Just...

01:26:58.821 --> 01:27:01.539
...take a couple weeks off
and drive down.

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:09.099
So, what you do is you drive
from Seattle to Redding.

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:12.059
Stay the night. The second day,

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:14.259
you drive on into LA.

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.059
You don't have to kill yourself
on the second day, you know.

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.860
You know, you could
stop in Sacramento.

01:27:19.021 --> 01:27:22.299
On the second day, stay there
the night, and the third day...

01:27:23.621 --> 01:27:26.140
Show up in LA,
nice and well rested.

01:27:26.301 --> 01:27:29.700
Sounds like it'd be a lot easier
to take a plane.

01:27:30.821 --> 01:27:32.219
Oh, no.

01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:36.180
No, Mary, driving down's half the trip.

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.300
You should come with me.
We could...

01:27:42.501 --> 01:27:45.459
We could leave tomorrow.
Or tonight.

01:27:49.499 --> 01:27:51.458
I'll think about it.

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.979
Maybe I need a change of pace too.

01:27:57.659 --> 01:27:59.499
Thanks for the drink.

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.099
Uh, call me. Let me know.

01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:06.299
I will.

01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.099
Bye, Billy.

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.458
Goodbye, Mary.

01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:51.778
Yes, Beatress?
You quit the club, I know. What?

01:28:51.939 --> 01:28:53.339
He wanted to know...

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:57.699
Excuse me, I can't hear you.

01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:58.819
Beatress?

01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:03.819
I'm sorry, Mary.

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:06.420
Ruby's husband.

01:29:07.781 --> 01:29:10.659
He wanted to know who you were,

01:29:10.819 --> 01:29:12.659
and where you lived.

01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:15.700
I didn't wanna tell him.

01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:19.860
He forced me.

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:22.419
He started to hurt me.

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:27.179
I'm so sorry, Mary.

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.299
I didn't know Ruby had a boyfriend.
