WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:04.504
(funky rock playing)

00:13.763 --> 00:16.766
{\an3}(giggles)

00:16.850 --> 00:17.726
(groans)

00:17.809 --> 00:18.935
I'm cold.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.063
{\an1}Oh, well, let me help you
with that.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.732
{\an3}I got it.

00:23.815 --> 00:24.649
I'll say.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.608
{\an3}Hi.

00:25.692 --> 00:26.735
I'm Gina.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.612
(chuckles) Hi, Gina.
Um, I'm Dylan.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.947
Very nice to meet you.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.742
{\an3}Hi, Dylan.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.618
So, you come here often?

00:35.702 --> 00:36.619
No, almost never.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.913
{\an4}Because, well,
it's such a big
scene, you know?

00:38.997 --> 00:39.789
Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.584
Well, what are you
doing here tonight?

00:42.667 --> 00:43.752
{\an3}Tonight?
Uh-huh.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.420
Tonight there is this girl...

00:45.503 --> 00:46.463
Oh! A girl?!

00:46.546 --> 00:48.673
She must be pretty cool.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.508
Oh, man, she's beautiful, sexy.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.470
Mmm!

00:53.553 --> 00:54.929
Smells good.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.686
Knows you do drugs.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.771
I can explain that.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.940
{\an3}No, you can't,
actually.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.025
You can't.

01:10.945 --> 01:16.117
Okay, why is it when you're
alone, all you see are couples?

01:16.201 --> 01:19.829
It's not like we need to be
reminded how pathetic we are.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.372
I know I don't.

01:21.456 --> 01:25.502
You know what I could use,
actually, is some advice

01:25.585 --> 01:27.837
on the fine art
of meeting Miss Right.

01:27.921 --> 01:33.301
So if you have any suggestions--
and I mean any--

01:33.384 --> 01:34.469
give me a call.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.138
Guys--
they are the worst.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.807
{\an3}Well, present company
excluded, right?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.350
{\an3}Or not.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.019
{\an1}They actually get insulted
if you don't swoon

01:43.102 --> 01:44.354
over the lamest pickup lines.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.522
{\an1}Oh, my God,
are you kidding?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.482
{\an1}I had this guy come up
to me once,

01:47.565 --> 01:48.525
and he goes, "Excuse me.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.485
{\an1}"I seem to have,
uh, lost my number.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.070
Can I borrow yours?"
Oh, no.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.363
{\an1}Okay, there was this guy
at this frat party

01:53.446 --> 01:54.322
{\an1}one time
that said to me,

01:54.405 --> 01:55.406
{\an3}"Um, are you
from Tennessee?

01:55.490 --> 01:58.535
{\an1}Because you're
the only ten I see."

01:58.618 --> 01:59.536
{\an3}Oh!
I like that one.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.621
{\an1}Girls have no clue
how hard it is

02:01.704 --> 02:02.539
to make the first move.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.542
{\an3}Most guys know they're
gonna get slammed.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.836
Um, maybe not.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.336
Gina, wait up!

02:09.419 --> 02:12.674
Donna, Dylan
doesn't have

02:12.757 --> 02:14.217
{\an3}the market
cornered on greatness.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.177
And you would
know this how?

02:16.261 --> 02:17.262
{\an3}Well, for
your information,

02:17.345 --> 02:18.680
I happen to have
mastered the art

02:18.763 --> 02:20.557
of the pick up.
(snickers)

02:20.640 --> 02:22.517
{\an1}Oh, I mean,
don't get me wrong.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.060
{\an1}You're cute.
Delusional, but cute.

02:24.143 --> 02:26.521
{\an6}I'm telling you,
my technique is
bulletproof

02:26.604 --> 02:28.022
and it's easily taught.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.399
{\an1}"How to be
the jerk women love."

02:29.482 --> 02:31.818
Sounds like a real
moneymaker to me.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.614
It does...

02:38.157 --> 02:39.868
doesn't it?

02:42.120 --> 02:44.247
{\an1}So the pie was homemade
by you?

02:44.330 --> 02:45.540
Yeah, it's not that hard.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.708
All you have to do is...

02:46.791 --> 02:48.209
And the pasta
you made, too?

02:48.293 --> 02:50.420
{\an6}Now that is a
lot easier than
most people think.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.589
Wow, you cook,

02:52.672 --> 02:56.426
{\an3}you take dance lessons,
oh, and you practice law.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.636
{\an1}Well, a lot of things
interest me.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.445
I'm sorry,
I just thought that, uh...

03:15.528 --> 03:19.073
This isn't about you.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.450
Of course not.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.618
{\an3}It's just weird
being here

03:21.701 --> 03:24.787
with someone other than Brandon.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.498
Right.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.917
Well, um...

03:29.000 --> 03:30.293
(chuckles)

03:30.376 --> 03:32.128
{\an1}why don't I
make us some coffee?

03:32.211 --> 03:33.755
You want some coffee?

03:33.838 --> 03:36.424
{\an1}Yeah?

03:36.507 --> 03:37.634
You hate me, don't you?

03:37.717 --> 03:38.927
Kelly, I don't hate you.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.511
I just thought that, um....

03:42.597 --> 03:45.141
I'm gonna make us some coffee.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.848
twice.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.518
I'm glad you came back.

05:55.563 --> 05:58.191
{\an3}I don't want to date a guy
who's doing drugs.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.821
Would you feel better
if I were in a band?

06:07.700 --> 06:10.745
Okay, I, just...

06:10.828 --> 06:15.958
{\an1}Um... I want to show you
something, all right?

06:16.042 --> 06:18.628
{\an1}And then if you still want
to leave,

06:18.711 --> 06:20.338
then you can leave.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.466
Come on.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.102
Part of me is glad
that you found it.

06:34.185 --> 06:34.977
Yeah?

06:35.061 --> 06:37.522
Come on.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.323
What are you doing?

06:47.406 --> 06:48.991
{\an3}Putting an end
to something

06:49.075 --> 06:52.245
{\an3}that never ever
should have started.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.873
{\an3}You finding
that stash was

06:55.957 --> 06:57.792
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.970
I'm sure Matt understands.

07:09.053 --> 07:09.887
I don't know.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.473
{\an1}First, I throw Dylan
at him and now Brandon.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.850
{\an3}Well, he lives
in Brandon's house.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.393
{\an3}where you used to live
with Brandon.

07:15.476 --> 07:16.352
He has to deal.

07:16.435 --> 07:20.356
{\an1}Well, I should have
raced him up those stairs.

07:20.439 --> 07:21.691
{\an3}(laughs)

07:21.774 --> 07:23.192
Oh, my God.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.194
You cannot believe how bad
the traffic is

07:25.278 --> 07:26.237
between here and Dylan's.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.989
She slept at Dylan's?

07:28.072 --> 07:30.199
{\an3}Weren't you just about
to go see Matt?

07:30.283 --> 07:31.200
No.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.118
Yeah, yeah, remember,

07:32.201 --> 07:33.661
{\an3}you said something
about racing upstairs.

07:33.744 --> 07:34.996
{\an1}Yeah, but, Donna,
I wanna...

07:35.079 --> 07:36.372
{\an3}And you know what?
That reminds me.

07:36.455 --> 07:38.040
{\an3}I really, really
want you

07:38.124 --> 07:40.376
to tell Matt hi for me,
'cause he, he's swell.

07:40.459 --> 07:42.253
Okay, um, you have
a great day and...

07:42.336 --> 07:43.254
He's swell?

07:43.337 --> 07:44.964
Yeah, he's nice. Bye.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.927
{\an1}Gina,
Hmm?

07:50.011 --> 07:51.512
{\an3}listen, um,

07:51.596 --> 07:53.764
{\an3}you said some really harsh
things on my birthday.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.142
We haven't talked since.
So, uh, what's the deal?

07:56.225 --> 07:58.436
{\an1}Yeah, you know what? I was
really upset that night.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.062
Well, do you have
a problem with me?

08:00.146 --> 08:02.732
{\an1}No, I, I said a bunch
of things I didn't mean.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.108
Then we should talk about it.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.401
I'm really sorry.

08:05.484 --> 08:08.029
{\an1}I didn't mean any of it.
(chuckles)

08:08.112 --> 08:09.864
{\an1}And unfortunately,
I have to go right now.

08:09.947 --> 08:10.907
Go where?

08:10.990 --> 08:12.033
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.159
I'm working as
a personal trainer,

08:13.242 --> 08:14.410
and I already have
my first client.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.370
Wait. You have
your first client? Who?

08:16.454 --> 08:17.455
Your mother.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.875
(sighs)

08:22.001 --> 08:23.586
JANET:
"The Art of the Pickup?"

08:23.669 --> 08:25.838
Oh, yes, I think it's time
I started sharing my genius.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.424
Oh, look. Yeah,
for $250 a head.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.426
{\an1}That's for two
seminars, Janet.

08:30.509 --> 08:31.928
{\an3}Oh, "taught by
Professor Steve Sanders."

08:32.010 --> 08:33.136
{\an1}Oh, there's truth
in advertising;

08:33.221 --> 08:36.474
{\an1}"When it comes to women,
I've got a Ph.D."

08:36.557 --> 08:38.226
{\an3}Steve?

08:38.308 --> 08:39.059
{\an1}Hey, bud.
Hey.

08:39.143 --> 08:40.770
{\an3}I, uh, got your
message about lunch.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.313
Yeah, I wanted to ask you

08:42.395 --> 08:45.274
{\an1}to help me on a small project
I'm working on.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.776
Do yourself a favor
and say no.

08:46.859 --> 08:51.447
{\an1}STEVE:
Uh-huh!

08:51.530 --> 08:53.282
<i>How to be the Jerk Women Love.</i>

08:53.366 --> 08:54.951
{\an3}Well, you were the one
asking for advice

08:55.034 --> 08:56.327
on landing Miss Right.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.454
{\an1}Yeah, well, I was hoping
to get it from someone

08:58.538 --> 09:00.164
{\an1}who knows what they're
talking about.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.251
Look, all I want you to do
is videotape the seminars

09:03.334 --> 09:04.919
{\an3}so I can reach
a larger audience.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.837
And make money on video sales.

09:06.921 --> 09:07.964
They're $29.95 apiece.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.340
Two for $50.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.466
That's a ten-dollar savings.

09:10.549 --> 09:11.926
Oh, such the humanitarian.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.261
{\an3}Are you in?

09:13.344 --> 09:17.139
{\an1}Yeah, sure.
We got nothing to lose.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.140
Yeah, nothing...

09:18.224 --> 09:19.475
except your dignity.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.481
GINA:
<i>23, don't forget to squeeze.</i>

09:25.564 --> 09:26.315
{\an1}Oh, boy,
you're killing me.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.441
You know that?

09:27.525 --> 09:29.193
{\an3}Yeah, well I saw
that size six

09:29.277 --> 09:30.987
{\an3}you're trying to pour
yourself into. Last one.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.780
Well, we all have our goals.

09:32.863 --> 09:38.327
Just some of them
aren't Olympian.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.829
{\an1}Yeah, well, it's probably
better that way.

09:39.912 --> 09:40.871
Less chance of disappointment.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.332
{\an3}You went for it.
That's what counts.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.168
You committed yourself.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.586
Something I wish
Donna would do.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.463
Donna has her own store.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.423
Yeah, that's this year.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.175
Next year, it'll probably be
something else .

09:53.259 --> 09:54.677
Less bounce.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.346
I can only hope the same will be
true of her boyfriend.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.181
Well, I wouldn't count
too much no that.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.391
They seem pretty attached.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.018
Oh? Tell me.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.020
She never does.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.315
Well, you know they practically
live together, right?

10:07.398 --> 10:09.025
{\an3}I tell you,

10:09.108 --> 10:11.319
sometimes I think she picks
a certain sort of man

10:11.402 --> 10:12.361
just to annoy me.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.030
{\an3}Well, you saw
that dress

10:14.113 --> 10:15.197
I want to get into.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.741
You think I can make it
by Thursday?

10:16.824 --> 10:20.578
Yes. What's the rush?

10:20.661 --> 10:23.080
Well, I've been invited
to, uh, a luncheon

10:23.164 --> 10:24.749
given by <i> George</i> magazine.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.501
John Kennedy
is gonna be hosting.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.420
Absolutely everyone
is gonna be there.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.213
Wow.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.381
{\an3}Yeah.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.383
I have, uh, two tickets.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.054
{\an3}I was going
to invite Donna.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.347
You know what?

10:39.430 --> 10:40.890
That's so weird
that you're saying that

10:40.973 --> 10:42.725
because I think Donna
was just reading

10:42.808 --> 10:44.518
about that luncheon
in the paper.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.521
Yeah, she said
that you'd sacrifice

10:47.605 --> 10:49.231
your firstborn to be there.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.360
I don't know why I bother
sometimes.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.695
She'd only go kicking
and screaming.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.156
Why don't I take you instead?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.532
{\an3}It would be
lovely to sit

10:58.616 --> 11:01.660
there with somebody who would
actually <i> like</i> to be there.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.537
Yeah?

11:03.621 --> 11:05.247
Okay.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.420
(knock at door)

11:15.049 --> 11:15.966
{\an3}Hi.
Hey.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.510
Got a second?

11:17.593 --> 11:19.553
Yeah, sure.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.554
Um, I...

11:20.638 --> 11:21.472
{\an3}What's up?
I just

11:21.555 --> 11:23.307
wanted to say I was
sorry about last...

11:23.391 --> 11:24.308
{\an3}WOMAN:
Shh!

11:24.392 --> 11:26.227
The souffle is rising.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.228
(whispers):
Right. Sorry.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.106
{\an1}Souffle?
Uh...

11:30.189 --> 11:31.315
Yeah, Kelly. This is Marissa.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.401
{\an4}She's, uh, teaching
me how to cook.
Hi.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.277
I'll be right in, okay?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.363
{\an3}The souffle should be
ready in a few minutes...

11:37.446 --> 11:39.323
if you'd like to stay.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.121
Um, so... you were saying...

11:45.204 --> 11:47.498
I didn't know you were
taking cooking lessons.

11:47.581 --> 11:48.499
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

11:48.582 --> 11:49.417
For a few months now, uh...

11:49.500 --> 11:51.168
ever since we went
on this blind date.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.462
{\an1}Oh, so you guys are dating?
No.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.840
We went on a date and realized
we had nothing in common.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.091
{\an1}And, uh...

11:57.174 --> 12:00.803
And that's why she's in your
kitchen making you a souffle.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.596
{\an3}Kelly, she's a friend.
I'm gonna

12:02.680 --> 12:04.390
{\an1}head out.
Kelly, you just got here.

12:04.473 --> 12:07.017
But I'm gonna leave.
It's just...

12:07.101 --> 12:11.105
{\an1}You know, uh, I really wish
you'd stayed last night.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.024
Just so you know.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.495
NOAH:
So, where's Dylan?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.955
GINA:
He went to the bathroom.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.374
You can't tell me that training
my mother wasn't awful.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.918
{\an1}Yes, I'm trying to tell
you-- it was really good.

12:33.002 --> 12:33.836
She works really hard.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.671
Wait, are we talking
about my mother here?

12:35.754 --> 12:38.841
{\an3}Because blowing her nails
dry is exercise to her.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.176
Yeah, well, it's amazing

12:40.259 --> 12:42.344
what a chance to mingle
with John John will do.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.554
John John, huh?

12:43.637 --> 12:45.181
Uh, yeah, you know...

12:45.264 --> 12:47.349
John Kennedy's throwing that
luncheon for his magazine.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.518
{\an1}What do you think
I should wear?

12:49.602 --> 12:51.520
Oh, you're going?

12:51.604 --> 12:52.354
Oh, yeah.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.191
{\an1}Well, Aunt Felice
has an extra ticket.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.526
She just gave it to you?

12:57.610 --> 13:01.030
{\an1}Yeah. Isn't your
mom the best?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.407
{\an3}Yeah, she's real
thoughtful.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.872
(knocking at door)

13:09.955 --> 13:11.707
Oh, go away.

13:11.790 --> 13:12.708
(knocking continues)

13:12.791 --> 13:14.543
Come on! What are you, deaf?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.467
I-I'm sorry.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.513
{\an3}Forget about what
your mom said.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.306
{\an1}You know, this may sound
like deja vu,

13:27.389 --> 13:29.558
{\an1}but I just shouldn't let
her get to me, right?

13:29.642 --> 13:30.392
That's right.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.520
See that yellow circle
right there?

13:32.603 --> 13:34.522
That yellow one is the mother.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.607
{\an3}See, these ones
are the children.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.777
{\an3}This void, it's all about
separation of family.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.738
You know, loss
of the family.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.908
{\an3}About 1974, divorce
rate skyrockets.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.826
This is what you get.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.038
It's just... you know...

13:51.121 --> 13:54.416
{\an3}Hey, Gina, you
like these paintings?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.751
{\an3}These are some
pretty great paintings.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.211
If you will pick

13:57.294 --> 13:59.421
{\an3}which of these paintings
is your favorite...

13:59.505 --> 14:00.714
I'll get it for you.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.384
{\an1}Oh, well, that's so sweet,
except for that it's

14:03.467 --> 14:05.261
a museum opening,
so they're not for sale.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.972
{\an1}Oh, yeah, hey, everything is
for sale for a price.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.432
He's out of control.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.309
{\an4}Come on.
DYLAN:
So which of these

14:12.393 --> 14:13.269
is your favorite?

14:13.352 --> 14:16.480
{\an3}Oh, this one is
definitely my favorite.

14:16.564 --> 14:20.276
Okay, so um... what's the title
of this painting?

14:20.359 --> 14:21.443
{\an3}Um, oh...

14:21.527 --> 14:24.154
it is <i> Tropical Tension.</i>

14:24.238 --> 14:27.157
It's on loan from the
Marchette Collection.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.784
From the what?

14:28.867 --> 14:32.454
Uh, from the Anthony
Marchette Collection.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.794
And I should be nice
to this guy?

14:38.877 --> 14:40.629
{\an3}You really
don't understand.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.465
Don't understand?
The guy's a jerk.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.425
Who's Anthony Marchette?

14:44.508 --> 14:47.636
{\an3}The guy that
killed Dylan's wife.

15:16.498 --> 15:17.374
(groans)

15:17.458 --> 15:20.377
Hey, how you feeling?

15:20.461 --> 15:23.505
I think I'm gonna live,
unfortunately.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.256
(clears throat)

15:26.258 --> 15:27.676
You're so cold,
you know that?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.511
Yeah...
You're really sweaty.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.180
(groans):
I can handle it.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.182
Dylan, you need
to see a doctor.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.183
I'll be all right.

15:34.266 --> 15:34.933
No, uh, Dylan...

15:35.017 --> 15:37.311
Hey, I got it
under control.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.524
Donna told me about Marchette.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.360
(sighs)

15:44.443 --> 15:45.569
I'm sorry.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.697
I know you are.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.325
I'm worried about you.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.327
I am fine.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.037
See?

15:56.622 --> 15:58.999
Hi. My name's Dylan.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.505
Yeah. (sighs)

16:04.588 --> 16:05.923
Hi. I'm Gina.

16:06.006 --> 16:06.965
{\an3}Hi, Gina.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.427
You know, there was this girl
here last night.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.303
She was very

16:11.387 --> 16:14.390
{\an3}beautiful, easy to
be with, no hassles.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.392
Do you have any idea
where she went?

16:16.475 --> 16:18.227
Well, I think she probably
disappeared,

16:18.310 --> 16:20.521
because you
started to do heroin again.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.231
{\an1}(scoffs)
Yeah.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.692
Are you using needles?
No.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.194
{\an6}If you're using needles,
you need to tell me.
Hey.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.071
What did I just say?
I said no.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.240
{\an3}Okay?
I'm clean.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.242
We're safe.
We used condoms.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.910
I don't know
what you're worried about.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.704
Is the interrogation over?

16:40.999 --> 16:42.418
Yeah, it's over.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.461
(sighs)

16:44.545 --> 16:46.630
So are we.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.763
(door opens)

16:54.847 --> 16:56.765
(door shuts)

16:56.849 --> 16:58.642
(sighs)

17:02.354 --> 17:05.065
(hip-hop playing)

17:10.487 --> 17:12.281
DONNA:
Kel...?

17:12.364 --> 17:15.284
It's a look.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.454
Unfortunately, so is <i> that</i>
going up to Matt's office.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.454
DONNA:
Wait, she's the

17:19.538 --> 17:20.955
reason that for
20 minutes now

17:21.039 --> 17:23.166
{\an1}you've been totally
butchering my display?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.794
{\an3}One of them; the others
were blonde and brunette.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.422
{\an1}I'm sure there's
a logical explanation.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.175
Yeah, yeah, I blew it.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.303
First I wait too long,
and then I panic.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.472
I can't blame him for moving on.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.931
Did you explain to Matt
about the other night?

17:38.015 --> 17:42.227
I tried,
but his souffle was rising.

17:43.604 --> 17:44.480
Don't ask.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.689
{\an3}Listen, I think
he's a great

17:45.773 --> 17:47.441
guy, and you shouldn't
let him go.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.526
There, I said my piece.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.488
Hey, Donna.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.280
Hey.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.156
{\an3}Kel.
Hey.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.157
I need your help.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.325
What?

17:56.408 --> 17:59.703
Well, a lot of people have
been calling up to my show

17:59.787 --> 18:01.371
{\an3}asking me for
relationship advice,

18:01.455 --> 18:03.332
{\an3}and I really don't feel like
I'm qualified to give it.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.335
{\an5}Why? Because you're not
in a relationship?
Well, Sophie

18:06.418 --> 18:09.087
dumped me for a guy that
she'd only known for...

18:09.171 --> 18:10.631
well, less than a day.

18:10.714 --> 18:11.673
And on the rebound, I

18:11.757 --> 18:13.884
{\an3}almost got thrown in jail
for statutory rape,

18:13.967 --> 18:15.761
{\an3}so it kind of eroded
my confidence.

18:15.844 --> 18:16.720
{\an3}You know?

18:16.804 --> 18:18.055
{\an1}Well, I think
you're being silly.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.515
But all right, sure.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.391
I think it'd be fun
to be on the radio.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.393
Great! Show starts at 9:00.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.729
{\an3}We should probably start
prepping somewhere around--

18:25.813 --> 18:27.689
{\an3}I don't know--
7:00, maybe.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.150
{\an3}I should be done stroking
Steve's ego by then.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.360
Why? What's Steve doing?
Well, Steve is

18:31.443 --> 18:35.197
{\an3}teaching, and I'm videotaping
a seminar on wooing women.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.157
(laughter)

18:37.241 --> 18:38.408
I'd invite you to

18:38.492 --> 18:40.702
{\an3}come, but you know,
it's guys only.

18:40.786 --> 18:44.039
You know, tricks of
the trade and all.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.207
See you tonight.

18:45.290 --> 18:49.711
(Donna laughing)

18:51.421 --> 18:52.548
We're sneaking in, right?

18:52.631 --> 18:54.925
{\an3}Absolutely.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.066
{\an3}Daddy.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.401
{\an3}DYLAN:
Look, Marchette...

19:12.484 --> 19:14.236
I love your daughter.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.320
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.741
No, no!

19:19.825 --> 19:21.410
Go on...

19:21.493 --> 19:23.245
(hammer cocks)

19:23.328 --> 19:23.954
Do it...

19:24.037 --> 19:25.581
{\an3}do it...

19:25.664 --> 19:27.082
No.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.743
What is this?

20:10.042 --> 20:11.126
You the manager?

20:11.209 --> 20:12.628
Uh, how can I help you?

20:12.711 --> 20:13.921
Where is my wife's grave?

20:14.004 --> 20:15.339
{\an3}Well, I'm sorry.
What was your wife's name?

20:15.422 --> 20:17.799
Antonia McKay.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.176
(typing)

20:19.259 --> 20:20.177
{\an3}McKay...

20:20.260 --> 20:23.764
Try "Marchette."

20:23.847 --> 20:26.475
Well, I'm-I'm afraid Miss
Marchette has been disinterred.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.935
I know that she has been moved.

20:28.018 --> 20:31.313
What I need you to tell me
is where is she now?

20:31.396 --> 20:33.315
I'm afraid her family hasn't
released that information.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.150
I am her family.

20:35.233 --> 20:36.360
I see.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.819
This is very unusual.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.781
You tell me where she is.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.699
I, I already told you-- I
don't have that informa...

20:42.783 --> 20:45.118
I said tell me!

20:45.202 --> 20:48.205
I'm sorry, I...

20:55.587 --> 20:56.838
(rock music plays)

20:56.922 --> 20:57.714
I'll be right there.

20:57.798 --> 20:58.674
All right.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.675
Hey.

20:59.758 --> 21:00.676
Hey.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.135
{\an1}Uh, how'd it
go last night?

21:02.219 --> 21:03.553
{\an1}Did you, uh,
catch up with Dylan?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.347
Yeah, I did.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.474
I asked about his wife.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.978
{\an3}And he told me about her
being killed by her father.

21:11.061 --> 21:11.812
Okay, coast is clear.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.480
Okay, one second.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.731
{\an3}Uh...

21:14.815 --> 21:16.984
we're going to eavesdrop

21:17.067 --> 21:18.652
on Steve's seduction

21:18.735 --> 21:20.320
seminar next door;
do you want to go?

21:20.404 --> 21:22.197
No, thanks.
I don't really feel like it.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.657
Uh, you know what?
I don't really feel like

21:23.740 --> 21:25.200
the luncheon either;
you should just go.

21:25.283 --> 21:28.578
No, I mean...
my mom invited you.

21:28.662 --> 21:31.164
Yeah, um, about that, Donna...

21:31.248 --> 21:32.207
You know, the truth...

21:32.290 --> 21:33.750
Well, I just feel

21:33.834 --> 21:34.876
really stupid about assuming

21:34.960 --> 21:36.253
that you'd already
turned her down.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.214
Oh, that's nice of you to assume

21:39.298 --> 21:40.841
{\an3}that she'd already asked me.
I just feel

21:40.924 --> 21:43.301
so bad, because she always says
so many mean things about you.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.720
She's just overly
critical, but...

21:44.803 --> 21:45.762
Well, I just want you

21:45.846 --> 21:47.681
to know that whenever I'm with
her I always...

21:47.764 --> 21:49.391
Did you say "mean"?

21:49.474 --> 21:52.019
Yeah, the worst.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.604
{\an3}But I always
defend you, though.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.899
Good-bye.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.408
{\an5}STEVE:
Now, make sure
you write that down,

22:06.491 --> 22:09.911
because that is the single most
important aspect of part three.

22:09.995 --> 22:14.124
Now, step four
is the subliminal approach.

22:14.207 --> 22:19.421
If a girl asks about your job,
don't say you're an ad man.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.131
say you're
"laying the groundwork

22:21.214 --> 22:23.300
for a career in advertising."

22:23.383 --> 22:25.260
She asks about vacations,

22:25.343 --> 22:29.389
well, you've just gotten back
from <i> Mounting</i> Everest,

22:29.473 --> 22:32.309
from <i> Mount</i> Kilimanjaro.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.269
Oh, my God.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.271
Suggesting a movie is simple.

22:36.354 --> 22:38.273
"Want to see something swell?"

22:38.356 --> 22:40.442
{\an1}Donna, do you want to see
something swell?

22:40.525 --> 22:41.485
No.

22:41.568 --> 22:43.070
Recreation?

22:43.153 --> 22:45.614
Well, "You like to play cards?
How about poker?"

22:45.697 --> 22:49.451
Now, if the conversation
turns to sports, well, you surf.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.286
But only when
it's really, really rough.

22:51.369 --> 22:54.206
When the swells are enormous.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.458
{\an6}(laughing)
Shh! They're
gonna hear us.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.335
Part five is
a roundtable discussion

22:58.418 --> 23:00.837
recorded earlier by some
of the finest practitioners

23:00.921 --> 23:02.631
of the swift seduction.

23:02.714 --> 23:03.882
Pshoo!

23:05.008 --> 23:07.135
See, I always say,
"You know why <i> I'm</i> here,

23:07.219 --> 23:08.512
I know why <i> you're</i> here."

23:08.595 --> 23:09.805
No line, no bull.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.598
{\an1}(mocking):
I know why <i> you're</i> here."

23:11.681 --> 23:14.518
{\an6}(laughs):
Yeah, to
laugh at <i> you.</i>

23:14.601 --> 23:17.270
See, now, I prefer
the understated approach.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.106
This I have to hear.

23:19.189 --> 23:22.484
Home-cooked meal, candlelight.
So they feel special.

23:22.567 --> 23:23.944
One of a kind.

23:24.027 --> 23:26.154
STEVE:
Good work.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.658
{\an3}Hey, didn't he just
do that for you?

23:29.741 --> 23:32.702
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.799
You should go.

23:45.882 --> 23:47.884
She's gone.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.845
Dylan, listen, um...

23:49.928 --> 23:51.930
{\an4}I went to
the cemetery...
(sighs)

23:52.013 --> 23:53.515
I have an appointment.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.184
{\an4}(sighs):
They moved
Antonia's grave.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.522
{\an1}Nobody seems
to know where.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.942
{\an3}I'm sorry.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.573
They took her from me...

24:09.656 --> 24:12.701
once.

24:12.784 --> 24:16.246
I can't believe they would
take her from me again.

24:33.471 --> 24:34.556
We need to talk.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.350
Okay.
That is, if you're not too busy.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.226
No, of course not.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.519
What with all the <i> clients</i>

24:39.603 --> 24:41.605
that you've
been seeing today.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.731
What do you mean? Clients...

24:42.814 --> 24:44.065
Don't tell me you don't remember

24:44.149 --> 24:45.609
all the women
who have been up here.

24:45.692 --> 24:49.029
The women, yes, I-I...
I remember the women.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.197
I, uh...

24:50.280 --> 24:52.407
And did you
make them dinner, too?

24:53.825 --> 24:56.411
Any woman that you saw up here

24:56.494 --> 24:59.414
was probably going
to the nail salon next door.

24:59.497 --> 25:01.416
That's a good one.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.710
I'm serious-- she's having,
like, some, I don't know,

25:03.793 --> 25:04.753
get-one-nail-painted,
get-the-other-one-free

25:04.836 --> 25:05.754
{\an3}discount...

25:05.837 --> 25:07.047
day.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.549
Oh.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.593
{\an3}That's good to know.
Yeah.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.429
Um, it's pretty crowded
over there,

25:14.512 --> 25:17.432
but I'm sure I can maybe
pull a few strings,

25:17.515 --> 25:20.352
{\an3}get you bumped up to
the front of the line.

25:20.435 --> 25:23.313
You don't believe
in cutting in front?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.609
I saw...

25:27.692 --> 25:29.945
the video from Steve's seminar.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.280
Steve's seminar? That...

25:32.364 --> 25:33.490
{\an3}that was for
guys only.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.243
Mm. The part you said
about the dinner,

25:36.326 --> 25:37.744
making the girl feel special.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.247
Well, it's true--

25:40.330 --> 25:41.623
I did feel special.

25:41.706 --> 25:42.624
I'm glad.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.459
But I don't anymore.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.963
Because of some stupid video?

25:48.046 --> 25:50.757
Because it's a technique.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.968
Yeah.

25:54.844 --> 25:58.265
A, um... game.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.100
So thought out.

26:00.183 --> 26:01.935
{\an3}I think...

26:02.018 --> 26:03.478
it's called flirting.

26:03.561 --> 26:04.521
Mm.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.481
{\an3}Do you have a
problem with that?

26:06.564 --> 26:07.524
No.

26:14.572 --> 26:16.533
{\an5}STEVE:
<i>Okay, guys,</i>
<i>now watch the master,</i>

26:16.616 --> 26:18.410
and you'll realize this is

26:18.493 --> 26:20.537
the best $250 you ever spent.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.707
Hi.

26:23.790 --> 26:25.625
I'm waiting for someone.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.377
That's okay.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.838
You mind if I
order a drink?

26:29.921 --> 26:31.298
Suit yourself.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.342
STEVE:
What kind of liquor

26:34.426 --> 26:35.719
is that?

26:35.802 --> 26:38.555
{\an1}Well, it's
a Long Island iced tea.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.182
STEVE (chuckles):
Long Island iced tea.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.185
That reminds me
of when I was a boy.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.313
My grandmother made
the best iced tea.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.856
She, uh...

26:47.939 --> 26:49.899
she, uh...

26:51.109 --> 26:52.235
Excuse me.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.529
Oh, no, please...

26:54.612 --> 26:55.488
stay and tell me.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.699
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Steve.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.327
{\an3}Yeah, ashamed all the way
to the bank. Cha-ching!

27:00.410 --> 27:04.414
{\an5}(voice-breaking):
She was making iced tea
the last time I saw her.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.666
Before they took her
to the hospital.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.878
Before I went to the orphanage.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.421
I don't know which
would be worse,

27:11.504 --> 27:13.923
falling for one of these lines
or actually using them.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.009
You poor thing. Come here.

27:16.092 --> 27:19.179
(sighs)

27:19.262 --> 27:20.889
STEVE:
Okay.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.390
{\an3}Any questions?
Is your...

27:22.474 --> 27:23.933
your-your grandmother,
is she okay?

27:25.435 --> 27:26.770
She's fine.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.229
(chuckles)

27:36.154 --> 27:37.864
Come here often?

27:37.947 --> 27:39.407
What?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.368
Let's just cut
the small talk.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.995
No line, no bull.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.414
(laughs):
Very funny.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.292
I know why <i> you're</i> here,
you know why <i> I'm</i> here.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.544
I know it, you know it,
we know it, it's known.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.380
{\an3}Oh, come here.
I hate you.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.756
I know.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.925
(chuckles)

27:57.008 --> 27:59.552
{\an3}I mean, I hate you.
(laughs)

27:59.636 --> 28:00.345
Hi.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.806
Oh. Sorry.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.766
Mom.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.059
Donna.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.811
{\an1}Let me get
those bags for you.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.062
{\an1}Oh, great.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.438
{\an1}Here, you can
take that, too.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.065
{\an1}NOAH (laughs):
Where to?

28:12.148 --> 28:13.441
Gina's room.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.068
{\an3}Okay.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.320
{\an4}GINA:
Your mom bought me
this outfit

28:17.404 --> 28:18.613
for the luncheon.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.782
(giggling)

28:20.865 --> 28:22.784
Well, how do I look?

28:22.867 --> 28:24.994
Oh, very Jackie O.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.788
I'm sure John-John
will be impressed.

28:26.871 --> 28:27.831
(laughs)

28:27.914 --> 28:30.417
{\an3}(chuckles):
We'll let you know.

28:31.376 --> 28:36.339
{\an1}Oh, maybe I should go in
and help Noah or something.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.134
Uh, Gina, before you go, I'd...

28:39.217 --> 28:41.469
I would just like
to apologize to you.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.471
{\an3}Why?
I'm just sorry

28:43.555 --> 28:44.848
that you got dragged into this.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.641
{\an3}"This"? What do
you mean by "this"?

28:46.724 --> 28:51.312
{\an1}You know,
I'm so excited...

28:51.396 --> 28:53.815
{\an1}to go to the luncheon,
but I think maybe

28:53.898 --> 28:56.151
{\an5}I better pass.
No, don't-don't
do that,

28:56.234 --> 28:59.320
not for me, because
no matter what, I'm not going.

28:59.404 --> 29:02.365
{\an3}Fine. Well, that
makes three of us.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.491
{\an1}Happy?

29:03.575 --> 29:04.659
Thank you for ruining

29:04.742 --> 29:07.537
{\an3}our perfectly
lovely afternoon.

29:10.582 --> 29:14.711
See, now I feel like I've
come between you two, and...

29:14.794 --> 29:17.755
that's the last thing
I wanted to do.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.686
Okay, this is it.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.354
I-I can't do this.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.149
{\an6}Aw, come on, this is
the moment you've
been waiting for.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.568
{\an3}This is the night
your dreams come true.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.862
Like a hot knife through butter.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.197
I can't... I'm not...

29:42.280 --> 29:45.366
{\an3}Aw, come on, come on,
think of step two.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.534
{\an3}Imagery.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.578
Uh...

29:48.661 --> 29:49.704
Hah?

29:49.787 --> 29:52.373
Come on, go get some.

29:52.457 --> 29:55.210
{\an6}Well, if not
for yourself,
then for them.

29:55.293 --> 29:58.213
♪ ♪

29:59.422 --> 30:01.341
{\an1}(takes deep breath,
exhales)

30:01.424 --> 30:04.427
{\an5}DAVID (over speakers):
Okay, gang,
here's the first call.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.553
Debby, what's
on your mind?

30:05.637 --> 30:06.721
It's my boyfriend.

30:06.804 --> 30:08.389
We've only gone out a month,

30:08.473 --> 30:10.433
and he's pressuring me
to sleep with him.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.726
Are you ready, Debby?

30:11.809 --> 30:13.478
I don't think so.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.230
Then don't.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.232
But he might break up with me.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.191
Yo, Debby, uh,

30:18.274 --> 30:20.735
look, if he breaks up
with you over that,

30:20.818 --> 30:22.237
he's a jerk, okay?

30:22.320 --> 30:23.738
You don't want to be
with someone like that anyway.

30:23.821 --> 30:26.407
Go slow-- when any of you
are in doubt, just...

30:28.117 --> 30:29.410
...go slow.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.412
{\an1}So, are the troops
doing battle?

30:31.496 --> 30:34.415
{\an5}Actually, it's just a
matter of time before
there's a body count.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.876
{\an1}Oh, you must be so proud.
Oh, yes.

30:36.960 --> 30:37.835
Check it out.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.757
{\an4}Do you have a mirror
in your pocket?
No. Why?

30:42.840 --> 30:45.969
{\an1}'Cause I can sure see myself
in your pants, girl.

{\an1}After you.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.428
{\an3}I insist.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.603
(knocking at door)

42:46.563 --> 42:48.649
{\an3}You have to stop.
You know that?

42:48.732 --> 42:49.775
Yeah, I know.

42:49.858 --> 42:51.026
Okay. You came back to me.

42:51.110 --> 42:53.779
I want you to let me help you.
I just want you to promise me.

42:53.862 --> 42:56.156
Hey, I will.
I'm gonna promise, I just...

42:56.240 --> 42:57.992
{\an3}Oh, I just... I got to...
I got to go somewhere.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.159
{\an1}Where?

42:59.243 --> 43:00.536
I got to see somebody.

43:00.619 --> 43:02.329
Somebody?
A guy.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.580
A guy.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.166
You know what? If you're gonna
be, um, cool and mysterious

43:06.250 --> 43:08.335
with me, then you can just
forget I even came by, okay?

43:08.419 --> 43:11.088
Hey! I am going

43:11.171 --> 43:13.007
to see Antonia's father.

43:13.090 --> 43:16.468
I need to know what
he did with my wife.

43:16.552 --> 43:18.679
{\an1}I thought he didn't
want you to know.

43:18.762 --> 43:20.097
No, he doesn't.

43:23.475 --> 43:25.602
I'm gonna see about
changing his mind.
