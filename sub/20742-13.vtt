I don't have partners.

You're okay.

03:59.583 --> 04:01.597
You're okay.

04:03.688 --> 04:06.008
You want to go get the brush?

04:10.595 --> 04:13.145
- Sure.
- Go get it.

04:21.238 --> 04:23.596
You want to give him
a good brushing?

04:23.775 --> 04:25.782
Sure.

04:28.846 --> 04:30.628
He needs to cool down.

04:32.184 --> 04:35.119
I'm gonna sell him to a man
in Marion County.

04:35.254 --> 04:37.322
Don't know what he wants
with this cutting horse...

04:37.456 --> 04:39.601
Are you going to retire?

04:42.695 --> 04:44.455
Papers have been
on my desk for two months.

04:44.526 --> 04:47.866
Carmen says I'm stalling.
Maybe I am.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.569
Well, I need to know.
Yes or no?

04:50.703 --> 04:53.038
Not at the moment.
No, I am not.

04:53.173 --> 04:54.439
Good.

04:54.574 --> 04:56.107
Why is that good?

04:56.242 --> 04:58.610
I want to work
the dead girls of Juarez.

04:58.744 --> 05:01.027
Is this about the uh...

05:02.048 --> 05:04.893
supposed bride of Steven Linder?

05:06.854 --> 05:08.673
Yeah.

05:09.590 --> 05:10.957
Sonya, that's a man

05:11.091 --> 05:13.579
you don't want to put
a whole lot of stock in.

05:15.289 --> 05:19.331
He said the car that picked Eva up
had U.S plates.

05:20.066 --> 05:22.534
What if an American
is involve in this?

05:22.568 --> 05:25.136
It's our responsibility
to do something.

05:25.170 --> 05:28.139
Yeah, responsibility, maybe.

05:28.273 --> 05:30.608
Jurisdiction, no.

05:30.743 --> 05:34.711
Well, if an American
commits a capital crime...

05:34.791 --> 05:36.489
like murder in Mexico,

05:36.550 --> 05:38.951
jurisdiction is determined
by both parties.

05:41.288 --> 05:43.660
So you been studying up.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.140
They have to do something,
Hank.

05:47.227 --> 05:48.661
Hey, Sonya...

05:48.795 --> 05:50.724
Look at me.

05:51.964 --> 05:55.781
For the past 15 years,
the Mexican police, us,

05:55.819 --> 06:00.707
the Mexican army, the FBI,
everybody has been working that case.

06:00.841 --> 06:03.465
There's been prosecutions.
Hell, there's been convictions.

06:03.544 --> 06:08.013
They got all kind of people locked up,
and still those girls die.

06:08.147 --> 06:10.531
It's a black hole.

06:12.452 --> 06:15.580
I want to work
the dead girls with Marco.

06:17.924 --> 06:20.545

my more sensitive work.

08:22.383 --> 08:26.042
I don't know, Monte.
Looks like you might be getting paranoid.

08:27.088 --> 08:29.156
Retainer agreements.

08:29.290 --> 08:31.858
Sign these and you'll have
attorney-client privilege.

08:31.993 --> 08:33.960
I already got an attorney.

08:34.095 --> 08:35.962
Not for this you don't.

08:36.097 --> 08:38.597
My fee is ten percent
of the company's profits.

08:38.732 --> 08:40.833
Company?
What company?

08:40.967 --> 08:43.001
Millwright Transportation Services.

08:43.037 --> 08:46.540
You're the CEO.
Ray and Cesar are employees.

08:46.674 --> 08:48.275
My associate Benjamin DeLarge

08:48.409 --> 08:51.344
will help you set up a corporate
account at Rayburn National Bank.

08:51.479 --> 08:53.446
He'll also handle the IRS.

08:53.581 --> 08:55.759
Whoa, whoa, hey.
Whatever deals y'all been cutting,

08:55.881 --> 08:59.052
someone forgot to send
a memo to old Ray Ray here.

08:59.187 --> 09:01.354
Bro, ten percent?
That's a little steep.

09:01.489 --> 09:03.356
It's an industry standard.

09:03.391 --> 09:04.457
Industry? Look, Tex...

09:04.492 --> 09:07.527
- Let the man talk, Ray Ray.
- <i>Gracias</i>, Cesar.

09:07.661 --> 09:11.497
Point is a rising tide lifts all boats,
hence the ten percent.

09:11.631 --> 09:14.633
We agree, Monte.

09:14.768 --> 09:16.835
Fausto asked me out to dinner.

09:16.970 --> 09:18.871
Should I go?

09:19.005 --> 09:19.872
No way, Char.

09:20.006 --> 09:22.007
I don't think
that's a good idea, <i>señora</i>.

09:22.142 --> 09:24.677
<i>Señor</i> Galvan likes to get
what he wants.

09:24.711 --> 09:27.246
He finds you captivating,
Ms. Millwright.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.657
An opinion I share.

09:31.283 --> 09:33.902
Tell him we agree to his terms.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.756
Thank you for everything, Monte.

09:37.890 --> 09:41.426
It is my pleasure,
Ms. Millwright.

09:43.795 --> 09:46.564
Char, I'm feeling
way out of the loop here.

09:46.698 --> 09:48.566
There is no loop, Ray.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.568
You can agree to what Monte's
offering or you can leave.

09:50.702 --> 09:51.736
Simple as that.

09:51.870 --> 09:53.370
Leave?

09:53.505 --> 09:55.039
You brought me here to help you.

09:55.173 --> 09:56.707
Help me?

09:56.842 --> 10:01.246
You went behind my back
with Tim.

10:01.380 --> 10:03.181
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

10:03.316 --> 10:06.084
You know,
I saw an opportunity and...

10:06.218 --> 10:07.452
"Muff dove."

10:07.586 --> 10:09.253
Was that an opportunity, too?

10:09.388 --> 10:11.255
- She raped me.
- Oh, really, Ray?

10:11.390 --> 10:13.257
Yeah, it was some kind
of cartel thing, you know.

10:13.392 --> 10:15.259
I was only doing
what I had to do.

10:15.394 --> 10:17.595
Well, now I'm doing
what I have to do.

10:17.629 --> 10:19.705
Protect myself.

10:20.399 --> 10:23.100
Are you with me?

10:24.236 --> 10:26.396
Yeah. Shit.

10:26.406 --> 10:28.448
I'm sorry, babe.

10:30.210 --> 10:32.711
Show me some respect.

10:32.846 --> 10:36.147
What? You have a great ass.
I couldn't help myself.

10:36.281 --> 10:38.649
You work for me, now.

10:38.683 --> 10:43.086
- Does Cesar slap my ass?
- No, <i>señora</i>.

11:03.886 --> 11:06.753
You're not giving up on this, huh?

11:10.346 --> 11:12.013
I knew you'd come.

11:12.148 --> 11:14.962
It's good to see you, too.

11:19.123 --> 11:21.157
Celia came to me.

11:21.191 --> 11:24.494
She saw Eva Guerra
at the police station.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.207
What?
She's in custody?

11:28.432 --> 11:31.954
Nope.
She's not there anymore.

11:33.738 --> 11:35.858
So she...

11:36.007 --> 11:39.541
disappeared
from your police station?

11:39.676 --> 11:42.211
I don't know that.

11:42.345 --> 11:46.805
Celia saw her.
That's all I know right now.

11:46.849 --> 11:49.652
Did you go to your captain
with this?

11:49.886 --> 11:53.661
I needed to talk
to someone I trust first.

12:00.230 --> 12:01.885
Sonya...

12:02.906 --> 12:05.582
Something like this has many layers.

12:06.603 --> 12:08.537
It's dangerous.

12:08.672 --> 12:11.189
You need to be careful.

12:13.739 --> 12:15.443
I know.

12:16.093 --> 12:18.084
We need to be careful.

12:35.534 --> 12:37.315
What is that shit... cupcakes?

12:37.333 --> 12:38.549
It's for your first day back.

12:38.572 --> 12:40.066
I told you I didn't want
a big deal out of it.

12:40.139 --> 12:41.515
It is a big deal.

12:41.608 --> 12:44.568
Come on, it'll be fun watching
people pretend they missed you.

12:44.603 --> 12:46.744
Look, I just want
to get back to work, all right?

12:46.878 --> 12:48.153
Maybe we talk to the DA
about Tate, maybe...

12:48.209 --> 12:50.274
Sherry wants to ease you back in.

12:51.183 --> 12:53.246
Ease me back in?

12:53.381 --> 12:55.186
What does that mean?
A Kiwanis club meeting?

12:55.320 --> 12:57.255
Millie Quintana turns a hundred
this Saturday.

12:57.389 --> 12:59.390
400 words, heartwarming.

12:59.524 --> 13:01.683
I'd rather stab a pencil in my eye

13:01.759 --> 13:03.243
than write that story.

13:03.395 --> 13:05.219
Let's skip the cupcakes.
Get in, let's go.

13:05.370 --> 13:07.401
Let's get it over with.

13:09.702 --> 13:11.770
Old people.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.922
Who wants to be a hundred
anyway?

13:20.033 --> 13:21.853
Be nice.

13:24.151 --> 13:25.626
The television's on.

13:25.786 --> 13:28.821
Hey, Adriana.
That does not look good.

13:28.956 --> 13:30.517
She could be hurt.
Go, uh... Go around.

13:30.558 --> 13:32.350
See if there's a back door,
window.

13:32.493 --> 13:35.708
Hey! Hey, lady!

13:38.938 --> 13:41.670
Hey! Lady!

13:48.475 --> 13:50.308
She's dead.

13:50.443 --> 13:52.410
I'm gonna look around.

14:08.396 --> 14:11.225
Holy shit.

14:16.604 --> 14:18.978
Shit.

14:21.647 --> 14:23.014
We need to hurry.

14:23.148 --> 14:24.891
Are you sure
you saw her in here?

14:24.984 --> 14:26.217
Yes, three days ago.

14:26.351 --> 14:28.353
Then why is she not
in the system?

14:28.487 --> 14:30.616
I don't know.
She was in here.

14:41.566 --> 14:44.502
There. Stop.

14:49.219 --> 14:50.663
It's her.

14:51.802 --> 14:53.873
Do you know him?

14:54.446 --> 14:57.514
No, I can't tell.

15:04.388 --> 15:06.166

15:42.695 --> 15:45.226
and throw a little somethin' somethin'
in the back of my car?

15:46.869 --> 15:47.986
What you got?

15:48.021 --> 15:50.065
Nobody would go on the record,
but it's a lot of money.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.401
No shit, Sherlock.
Define a lot.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.803
About $30 million
is the number I heard.

15:54.938 --> 15:58.408
Ooh. So, some old bitty dies
baby-sitting a cartel fortune.

15:58.876 --> 16:02.045
I'd say it's a pretty decent first day
back at work, wouldn't you?

16:02.179 --> 16:04.413
That's not all.
Half of it's euros.

16:06.096 --> 16:07.609
No shit.

16:07.710 --> 16:09.132
Yeah.

16:09.753 --> 16:11.420
Thanks. I appreciate it.

16:12.532 --> 16:14.297
Want to take a guess
on the final count?

16:14.322 --> 16:16.892
Uh, 50 million bucks.

16:17.027 --> 16:19.462
Cops always estimate low in case
they can pocket some.

16:19.596 --> 16:20.663
40 million dollars.

16:20.797 --> 16:21.898
I was close.

16:22.032 --> 16:24.300
And 20 million euros.

16:24.435 --> 16:28.237
Wow.
It's-it's like 65 million dollars U.S.

16:28.372 --> 16:30.640
All a hundreds and twenties,
both currencies.

16:30.774 --> 16:33.075
What is up
with the whole euro thing?

16:33.210 --> 16:34.724
That's the story.

16:34.859 --> 16:36.645
It's weird.
It's really weird.

16:36.780 --> 16:39.081
But I like it.
Weird is good.

16:39.216 --> 16:41.107
This came for you.

16:41.142 --> 16:43.166

You said you knew
where we were going.

19:55.921 --> 19:57.121
I do.

19:57.546 --> 19:58.992
We missed the highway.

19:59.169 --> 20:01.186
It's safer this way, Ray.

20:01.611 --> 20:05.039
Shit, man, I took fast
boats loaded to the rails

20:05.074 --> 20:07.239
with coke into Miami,
never got stopped once.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.232
- You know why?
- Why, Ray?

20:09.267 --> 20:12.222
It's 'cause I didn't give a shit
about not being seen.

20:12.257 --> 20:14.474
It's like that scene in Apocalypse Now

20:14.531 --> 20:17.402
where Bobby D. makes those boys go surfing
with Charlie firing on their ass.

20:17.536 --> 20:19.347
I've never seen it.

20:19.831 --> 20:23.174
The point is, all this creeping around
is what draw suspicion.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.329

20:25.685 --> 20:27.679

I want to get off.
This isn't good.

Now it's a house for the damned.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.092

21:33.227 --> 21:36.396
If we're lucky, yes.

He was supposed to kill her

All right?

All right? Come with us.

23:09.048 --> 23:10.948
You're good.

23:15.529 --> 23:16.748
He's okay.

23:16.883 --> 23:19.068
<i>Está bien, mi niña.</i>

23:19.236 --> 23:21.070
He's okay.

23:33.928 --> 23:35.398
She was taken to a party...

23:35.433 --> 23:37.494
drugged, raped..

23:37.529 --> 23:39.132
Who knows what else?

23:39.267 --> 23:42.283
- Police?
- Some.

23:43.891 --> 23:45.792
We need to fix this.

23:45.927 --> 23:50.430
Yeah, well, not now, Sonya.

23:50.464 --> 23:54.888
She-She's not safe in Mexico.
We need to get her across the border.

23:55.469 --> 23:58.104
I have this friend.
He's a paramedic.

23:58.238 --> 24:00.414
He can get access to a ambulance.

24:00.554 --> 24:02.655
To get her across...

24:02.710 --> 24:05.624
You sit in the back,
show your badge at the border.

24:05.885 --> 24:09.328
All right?
You should not have any problems.

24:19.094 --> 24:22.598
All right. I can do that.

24:22.698 --> 24:25.265
Thank you.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.177
But you'll do something
about this.

24:30.372 --> 24:32.841
Yes.

24:56.678 --> 24:58.746
Didn't know who else to call.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.981
I think she needs medical attention.

25:01.115 --> 25:03.916
Yeah, well, Carmen's
coming back from the hospital.

25:04.051 --> 25:08.286
She'll do what she can do,
but... she might need more.

25:08.420 --> 25:10.588
Come on, sweetie.

25:10.723 --> 25:13.316
- I fixed up your old room.
- Thanks.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.015
Step up. Up.

25:17.163 --> 25:19.564
Step up.

25:25.404 --> 25:28.406
How'd you get her across the border?

25:28.541 --> 25:30.779
Ambulance.

25:32.445 --> 25:35.309
Marco called in a favor.

25:41.723 --> 25:44.393
Who else knows that she's here?

25:44.493 --> 25:47.928
Nobody.

25:48.063 --> 25:51.798
So, you want to tell me
what this is about?

25:55.736 --> 25:58.997
Cops in Juarez did this to her.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.880
Marco told me to stay out of it.

26:06.014 --> 26:07.882
Yeah, well, let him handle it.

26:08.016 --> 26:09.351
He's in no shape to handle it.

26:09.424 --> 26:11.677
He's grieving.

26:12.686 --> 26:17.022
I watched him beat
a man half to death yesterday.

26:17.456 --> 26:20.795
- Related to this case?
- Yes.

26:33.774 --> 26:37.421
You know, I prefer,
uh, the rib eye.

26:38.178 --> 26:41.514
It's all about the fat.

26:41.648 --> 26:44.050
I prefer T-bones.

26:44.184 --> 26:46.922
My boyfriend likes them better.

26:47.488 --> 26:50.357
Come a long way since Tampa.

26:50.492 --> 26:53.594
I wish I could say
the same for Ray...

26:55.163 --> 26:57.898
Do I know you?

26:58.033 --> 27:00.334
Froome.

27:03.905 --> 27:07.773
Arliss Froome.

27:10.678 --> 27:13.947
We know about the tunnel.

27:14.081 --> 27:18.786
And we know
about <i>Señor</i> Fausto Galvan.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.122
You know...

27:21.257 --> 27:23.959
We know a lot of things, Charlotte.

27:23.993 --> 27:25.960
Who are you?

27:26.095 --> 27:29.063
Well, right now...

27:29.197 --> 27:33.367
I am your only friend.

27:33.501 --> 27:36.303
FBI?

27:36.438 --> 27:37.905
I knew it.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.308
No, not exactly.

27:40.442 --> 27:43.412
But you know what I like?
I like the way you're thinking.

27:43.546 --> 27:48.251
It means that you know
what's coming.

27:48.385 --> 27:51.087
What's coming?

27:51.221 --> 27:53.565
Right now, nothing.

27:56.059 --> 27:59.448
And make sure you go
to that dinner with Fausto.

28:00.264 --> 28:02.931
How do you know about that?

28:03.066 --> 28:05.935
We know everything.

28:06.070 --> 28:08.338
I'll be in touch.

28:11.743 --> 28:13.977

Hi.

29:24.748 --> 29:27.749
What are you doing here?

29:27.884 --> 29:30.819
You don't look so good.

29:30.954 --> 29:33.688
I was... sleeping.

29:33.822 --> 29:35.823
It's late.

29:35.958 --> 29:39.894
Can I have a drink?

29:40.029 --> 29:42.330
Uh, yeah.

29:42.464 --> 29:43.932
Sure.

29:44.066 --> 29:46.368
Come in.

30:17.502 --> 30:21.137
Don't you have something else
to do tonight?

30:24.742 --> 30:27.276
You beat that man up.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.445
He was a cop.

30:29.580 --> 30:31.981
We found Eva, right?

30:32.116 --> 30:33.550
You're a cop.

30:33.684 --> 30:34.951
You can't do that.

30:35.086 --> 30:38.018
Oh, yes, I can. And I did.

30:39.457 --> 30:42.392
Something's changed, Marco.

30:42.527 --> 30:45.729
A lot of things changed.

30:47.030 --> 30:49.659
Alma is gone.

30:50.567 --> 30:52.603
My daughters are gone.

30:52.770 --> 30:54.972
Gus is dead.

30:55.106 --> 30:56.934
I know what you're thinking.

30:57.015 --> 30:58.941
Is that so?

30:59.611 --> 31:03.247
You want to kill David Tate.

31:18.062 --> 31:21.864
He took everything from me.

31:21.999 --> 31:24.500
But he's safe.

31:24.635 --> 31:27.937
He'll go to trial.

31:28.072 --> 31:31.374
Maybe get the death penalty.

31:33.277 --> 31:36.179
I don't know and I don't care.

31:36.314 --> 31:39.816
It's out of my hands.

31:42.152 --> 31:45.488
When Lisa was murdered...

31:45.622 --> 31:48.991
I wanted the man who did it to die.

31:49.126 --> 31:52.462
- I prayed for it to happen.
- Well, maybe Hank

31:52.596 --> 31:54.464
should have killed him
when he had the chance.

31:54.599 --> 31:56.466
He would never do that.

31:57.835 --> 32:01.371
Of course not.
He's a good man.

32:06.543 --> 32:10.245
I'll be okay, Sonya.

32:10.380 --> 32:13.456
- Okay.
- Okay?

32:18.957 --> 32:21.141
There's nothing I can do.

32:21.293 --> 32:22.872
Don't worry.

32:22.928 --> 32:25.500
I won't do anything stupid.

32:27.599 --> 32:29.500
I know.

32:29.634 --> 32:32.737
You're a good man.

32:37.043 --> 32:39.323
Hmm.

32:41.081 --> 32:43.250
