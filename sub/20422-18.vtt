00:02.540 --> 00:04.400
Miss Nureha!

00:04.510 --> 00:05.940
Miss Nureha!

00:06.580 --> 00:08.530
Londark, anything to report?

00:08.830 --> 00:10.560
Nothing so far.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.030
The princess does what she pleases, anyway.

00:13.030 --> 00:15.210
Does Mizufa intend to search for her?

00:15.210 --> 00:17.780
I'll tell you what Mizufa had to say...

00:18.010 --> 00:21.880
We're in the middle of Operation Red Night.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.410
And if Miss Nureha left of her own free will,

00:25.410 --> 00:27.540
it's none of our business.

00:28.110 --> 00:30.410
Is that sarcasm, Londark?

00:30.410 --> 00:33.550
The princess is the leader of Plant Hwyaden!

00:37.760 --> 00:39.340
Miss Nureha...

00:40.000 --> 00:44.240
If you were going home, 
you should have taken me, Loreil.

00:49.170 --> 00:50.310
West?

02:28.320 --> 02:29.120
Again...

02:29.630 --> 02:31.250
The Odyssey Knights, huh?

02:31.510 --> 02:35.950
Around here, they aren't such an unusual sight.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.260
Really?

02:37.600 --> 02:40.010
The People of the Land welcome them.

02:40.350 --> 02:45.020
They risk their lives fighting to 
protect the villages and towns.

02:45.020 --> 02:50.760
They do seem a bit tense, 
but they're so cool and disciplined.

02:51.270 --> 02:52.540
You think so?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.630
They do seem like they'd be 
handy to have around...

02:54.630 --> 02:55.900
I don't like that thing.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.190
It just doesn't feel right.

02:58.620 --> 02:59.780
Me, either.

03:00.350 --> 03:01.760
I couldn't say why.

03:02.570 --> 03:08.540
<b>When the Concert Ends</b>

03:05.130 --> 03:06.770
When the Concert Ends.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.920
Let's eat!

03:14.770 --> 03:16.280
How is it?

03:16.870 --> 03:19.170
I haven't gotten any better at it...

03:19.520 --> 03:22.060
That's not true. It's great.

03:22.060 --> 03:23.450
It's perfect!

03:23.450 --> 03:25.510
You're getting better and better at cooking.

03:25.740 --> 03:28.130
And under this star-filled sky...

03:28.130 --> 03:29.640
It's a fantastic dinner.

03:30.180 --> 03:32.520
You're all so close.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.190
Because we're friends.

03:34.190 --> 03:35.900
Yeah, we're friends.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.530
If you don't mind my asking,

03:38.530 --> 03:42.160
why are you headed to the Redstone Mountains?

03:42.520 --> 03:44.410
We're going to hunt a wyvern.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.480
We need it for the materials for a magic bag.

03:47.930 --> 03:49.480
I see.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.650
We're almost to the town of Safil, aren't we?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.010
That's right.

03:55.010 --> 03:56.880
Have you ever been there, Dariella?

03:57.220 --> 04:00.130
It's on my way home, so I've 
been there a few times.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.930
Once we get there, I'd like to hold a concert!

04:04.270 --> 04:05.670
A concert?

04:05.670 --> 04:06.930
What's that?

04:06.930 --> 04:10.170
Come to think of it, Roe 2 hasn't seen one, either.

04:10.170 --> 04:13.160
Isuzu is a bard.

04:14.150 --> 04:16.320
But I'm still not much more than an amateur.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.030
Wherever we go, she plays all 
kinds of different songs.

04:20.030 --> 04:21.700
Oh! Music?

04:24.440 --> 04:29.200
Back at Blume Hall in Akihabara, 
I was called a rock 'n' roller!

04:29.200 --> 04:31.080
A rock 'n' roller?

04:31.080 --> 04:34.960
Um, in other words, they think she's cool.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.690
What?

04:36.690 --> 04:37.960
That's leaving too much out.

04:38.260 --> 04:41.210
You play music, though. That's interesting.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.080
It's kind of wonderful.

04:46.190 --> 04:49.620
Okay, when we get to Safil, we'll do one!

04:49.620 --> 04:51.060
Yeah!

04:53.370 --> 04:56.000

Okay, here we go!

That was fun...

05:49.790 --> 05:51.490
And I'm full.

05:51.940 --> 05:55.600
Miss Isuzu, are you sure 
you didn't eat too much?

05:55.600 --> 05:57.350
I couldn't help it.

05:57.350 --> 05:58.410
Thanks.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.250
People of the Land kept buying me food.

06:03.550 --> 06:05.780
Still, it was a good concert today.

06:06.190 --> 06:07.750
Another good concert, you mean.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.750
Another good one, yes.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.770
Miss Isuzu, you really do 
love instruments, don't you?

06:16.130 --> 06:17.320
I love them.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.900
But you still keep saying you're not 
much more than an amateur?

06:21.710 --> 06:22.730
Yeah...

06:22.730 --> 06:25.280
It's not like I'm trying to be humble or anything.

06:26.390 --> 06:32.020
I may have said this before, 
but my dad was a pro musician.

06:32.020 --> 06:33.090
I understand.

06:33.090 --> 06:37.460
Then the reason you're so good is due to 
your father's blood and your training.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.710
Oh, come on, that's a bit of a stretch.

06:40.130 --> 06:43.070
My dad was a really free spirit.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.790
He was a rock 'n' roller.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.390
He was so cool.

06:46.390 --> 06:50.260
He had long hair that flowed in the 
wind, and this leather jacket.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.050
His legs were so thin.

06:52.860 --> 06:56.930
And he loved to brag to me, his daughter...

06:57.270 --> 07:00.130
Stories about the things he did 
when he was young, I guess.

07:00.130 --> 07:02.600
He worked at a part-time job 
to buy this lousy old car,

07:02.600 --> 07:05.620
and he put all his instruments 
in it and went touring.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.490
He said he went from Tokyo all around the country.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.320
Like us?

07:09.320 --> 07:11.120
Yeah, that's right!

07:11.640 --> 07:13.480
He sounds like a wonderful father.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.510
Right?

07:14.510 --> 07:18.750
He was a little weird, but he was my hero.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.580
He even made his major debut!

07:22.490 --> 07:24.110
Major debut?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.690
A major record company streamed his music.

07:27.950 --> 07:32.100
Uh, in other words... He got really famous.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.840
So famous you could hear his band's 
songs all around the town.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.360
That's amazing!

07:37.840 --> 07:43.100
But you know, in my world, there are 
a lot of amazing people like that.

07:43.510 --> 07:46.600
Every year, over a hundred people 
make their major debuts.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.810
But most of them don't last long...

07:51.060 --> 07:56.130
Only a handful keep selling 
long after their debut.

07:56.580 --> 07:59.370
And my dad wasn't one of them.

08:00.030 --> 08:01.840
Did he quit?

08:01.840 --> 08:05.310
No, he loved music, so he couldn't quit.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.010
So he became a studio musician.

08:09.190 --> 08:12.510
That's, well... How should I describe it?

08:12.510 --> 08:15.910
I know. He became a super-pro instrument player.

08:15.910 --> 08:18.520
He helps out many different 
people with their music.

08:18.860 --> 08:22.240
Then you'll make your major debut, won't you?

08:22.240 --> 08:23.330
No.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.290
A major debut is something professionals do.

08:25.290 --> 08:27.810
You play, and it makes everyone happy.

08:27.810 --> 08:29.000
Doesn't that make you a pro?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.190
No, it doesn't!

08:35.810 --> 08:39.290
I'm sorry... I'm not like that.

08:39.570 --> 08:42.090
I like the lute, of course.

08:42.090 --> 08:43.180
I love it.

08:43.180 --> 08:44.700
And I love singing, too.

08:45.550 --> 08:49.550
But... I don't have any talent.

08:50.850 --> 08:55.430
My dad would always say that 
becoming a pro was really hard.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.540
You're expected to have natural talent.

08:58.540 --> 09:01.220
Even if you do, you have to 
work as hard as you can,

09:01.220 --> 09:03.710
and only then can you see the starting line.

09:03.710 --> 09:04.730
Oh.

09:04.730 --> 09:07.740
So I'm happy just doing it because I like it.

09:07.740 --> 09:09.940
And it makes everyone happy, too.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.450
I also love your songs, Miss Isuzu.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.090
You're so nice, Rudy.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.830
I'm nothing special at all...

09:20.020 --> 09:21.670
That isn't true.

09:21.670 --> 09:25.890
We all look forward to hearing your songs.

09:25.890 --> 09:28.210
To hearing a forty-two we don't know.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.210
Huh? Forty-two?

09:31.210 --> 09:35.440
Sometimes, it seems like we're not 
really understanding each other.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.490
Oh...

09:36.840 --> 09:38.220
So that's how it sounds to you.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.860
Yeah, that's happened to me.

09:41.860 --> 09:43.170
You, too?

09:43.170 --> 09:47.940
A while back, I asked for fish paste at 
a store, and they gave me flour paste.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.450
What?

09:49.450 --> 09:51.460
It's probably because of that...

09:51.460 --> 09:52.730
That?

09:52.730 --> 09:54.240
The auto-translator.

09:54.240 --> 09:58.240
Oh, the one that lets you 
talk with foreign players.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.150
Yes.

09:59.150 --> 10:01.770
It seems like the languages of adventurers

10:01.770 --> 10:04.200
and People of the Land are actually a bit different.

10:04.200 --> 10:09.430
Normally, thanks to the auto-translator, 
we can talk to each other...

10:09.430 --> 10:10.750
Which means...

10:10.750 --> 10:15.760
Sometimes, there are things the system 
can't handle, and it causes errors.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.440
I get it!

10:17.440 --> 10:20.510
Then that's why we don't 
always understand each other.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.160
Let me see...

10:22.160 --> 10:25.020
If I say, "seven colors," what do you think of?

10:25.620 --> 10:26.770
A rainbow?

10:27.060 --> 10:31.930
Yes. If I say, "seven colors," in People of 
the Land's language, it means a rainbow.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.300
Then what's "forty-two"?

10:34.710 --> 10:35.950
Music.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.280
Why?

10:38.040 --> 10:43.030
To us, the People of the Land, 
"music" only encompasses forty-two songs.

10:45.180 --> 10:49.540
God only gave our ancestors 
those forty-two songs.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.770
And we can't make new ones.

10:54.110 --> 10:56.910
A leftover from when it was a game?

10:57.570 --> 11:00.720
That's the only music we have.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.100
Since we were born, that's how it's always been.

11:03.560 --> 11:07.180
We thought that was normal, and went our 
whole lives without thinking about it.

11:07.740 --> 11:10.690
<i>I never considered that.</i>

11:11.060 --> 11:17.690
So, Isuzu, we really love the songs 
you sing and the music you play.

11:18.860 --> 11:22.810
Do you remember the inns 
and pubs before we left?

11:23.410 --> 11:28.200
You just played a simple song, 
and everyone was so happy, they cried.

11:29.350 --> 11:31.120
They were really happy.

11:31.590 --> 11:34.790
Bright, upbeat songs that they'd never heard.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.380
Songs that made them want to dance.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.630
Or songs that made them want to 
be with someone they cared for.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.870
We'd never heard anything like that.

11:44.410 --> 11:48.500
And you brought them to us.
That made you a hero.

11:50.180 --> 11:51.360
Rudy...

11:52.170 --> 11:55.230
Do you think Isuzu will become a pro?

11:55.230 --> 11:57.680
I think she wants to, honestly.

11:57.680 --> 12:02.330
It must be nice to have something 
you're better at than anyone else.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.570
You're right.

12:04.570 --> 12:08.820
I'm jealous of how she can sing and 
play an instrument like that.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.490
I'm not really good at anything I try.

12:11.490 --> 12:15.000
Have you ever thought about your future, Serara?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.810
You mean if we get back to our world?

12:17.810 --> 12:19.100
Yeah, if we do.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.630
No, even if we don't.

12:20.630 --> 12:22.240
Like, what you want to be.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.520
I don't know...

12:24.520 --> 12:26.300
It isn't really clear.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.670
I see.

12:27.670 --> 12:30.670
You seem like you've really thought about it.

12:31.540 --> 12:32.990
I don't know.

12:32.990 --> 12:35.060
I know who I'd want to be like...

12:35.840 --> 12:37.570
<i>I want to be like Shiroe.</i>

12:38.030 --> 12:41.150
<i>But what does that mean?</i>

12:41.150 --> 12:43.540
<i>It isn't his job, I know that much.</i>

12:43.540 --> 12:47.580
<i>And no one could replace him, anyway...</i>

12:48.580 --> 12:50.470
I just don't know!

12:50.470 --> 12:51.580
Minori?

12:52.420 --> 12:57.380
Did you notice that more and more young 
People of the Land are coming to Akihabara?

12:57.380 --> 12:58.210
Nope.

12:58.470 --> 13:01.580
They're all coming because they 
have dreams for their future.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.950
Blacksmiths, tailors, chefs, musicians...

13:04.950 --> 13:06.460
A lot of others, too.

13:06.830 --> 13:09.260
Just a few months in Akihabara 
will teach you skills

13:09.260 --> 13:12.730
you couldn't learn in a lifetime anywhere else.

13:13.430 --> 13:15.280
You can be who you want to be.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.730
Like you?

13:17.730 --> 13:19.500
Yeah, that's right.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.290
I became an adventurer.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.790
They also have something they want to be.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.990
We get together to talk about that stuff.

13:30.870 --> 13:33.790
That's why I occasionally run off.

13:34.690 --> 13:38.920
It's sometimes hard for People of 
the Land to live in Akihabara.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.550
But it's lucky, too.

13:40.990 --> 13:43.350
Every day, something happens there.

13:44.040 --> 13:48.100
What you couldn't do yesterday 
may be possible today.

13:48.790 --> 13:51.990
Tomorrow will be different from today...

13:53.520 --> 13:57.190
And your songs are one of the wonderful 
things to be found there.

13:58.100 --> 14:03.940
The People of the Land are all thinking 
about their futures, aren't they?

14:04.520 --> 14:06.200
I'm not even...

14:07.700 --> 14:13.610
I feel embarrassed for irresponsibly 
singing about love and life...

14:13.610 --> 14:15.930
No, Miss Isuzu, that isn't—

14:15.930 --> 14:17.710
I'm sorry, Rudy.

14:18.670 --> 14:20.960
You can go back to your room.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.000
All right.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.720
I'm so pathetic.

14:57.820 --> 15:00.900
Come to think of it, there was 
a river next to Choushi, too.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.420
Why is that, again? Umm...

15:03.850 --> 15:06.720
Settling near a river gives a town plenty of water,

15:06.720 --> 15:11.090
which is better for living and for fields, right?

15:11.750 --> 15:14.680
Depositional plains, was that their name?

15:14.680 --> 15:17.430
School classes come in handy...

15:30.210 --> 15:32.530
Good morning, Tohya.

15:32.780 --> 15:33.830
Good morning.

15:34.930 --> 15:36.790
Why don't you come over here?

15:36.970 --> 15:38.390
S-Sure.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.270
Dariella... Are you on a morning walk?

15:43.270 --> 15:44.150
Yes.

15:44.150 --> 15:46.050
I'm a light sleeper.

15:46.350 --> 15:48.310
You live in Minami, right?

15:48.310 --> 15:50.180
I travel all the time.

15:50.470 --> 15:54.470
My job is to go all around, 
and write down what I see and hear.

15:54.890 --> 15:59.310
But I suppose my home would be near Ikoma.

15:59.310 --> 16:00.060
Ikoma?

16:00.520 --> 16:03.940
Past Kyoto, is how I think you would describe it.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.620
I see.

16:05.620 --> 16:08.740
But I live alone in a shack.

16:08.740 --> 16:11.520
It isn't a place where you get visitors.

16:11.860 --> 16:14.570
So when I want to enjoy the town air,

16:14.570 --> 16:16.080
I go on journeys like this.

16:16.570 --> 16:17.950
Isn't that dangerous?

16:17.950 --> 16:19.640
I'm used to it.

16:19.640 --> 16:25.590
And the roads have gotten a lot safer 
since Plant Hwyaden started patrolling.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.050
Plant Hwyaden, huh?

16:45.520 --> 16:50.650
Plant Hwyaden has made Minami into 
a beautiful, prosperous town.

16:50.650 --> 16:52.860
Have you no interest in it?

16:53.130 --> 16:54.980
I wouldn't say that.

16:54.980 --> 16:59.590
Then, if you get the chance, come to my house.

17:01.030 --> 17:03.620
If you do, I'll show you around.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.720
We'll go out together.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.920
You've been avoiding looking at me.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.320
No, I'm not.

17:12.050 --> 17:15.270
You don't dislike me, do you?

17:15.270 --> 17:16.940
That part of you, I do dislike!

17:19.520 --> 17:21.300
You're always smiling.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.310
Yes.

17:24.180 --> 17:25.400
What of it?

17:25.900 --> 17:28.770
You wouldn't look weird without that smile.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.150
You'd look better that way.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.940
That isn't true.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.910
Why do you say that?

17:45.730 --> 17:46.600
Whoa!

17:46.600 --> 17:47.850
How rude!

17:47.850 --> 17:50.460
Well, where'd you even come from?

17:50.460 --> 17:51.900
The window.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.970
At least come in the door.

17:53.970 --> 17:54.880
And?

17:54.880 --> 17:58.000
The reconnaissance went off without a hitch.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.450
There wasn't any problem this time.

18:00.450 --> 18:02.350
Well, we were mostly after basic information.

18:03.050 --> 18:04.850
Can I report to you now?

18:04.850 --> 18:06.600
Yes, please.

18:06.970 --> 18:09.850
Regarding the city of Maihama 
and the Cowen family,

18:09.850 --> 18:15.310
you're well acquainted with Princess 
Lenessia's grandfather, Sergiatte, right?

18:15.310 --> 18:15.860
Yes.

18:16.620 --> 18:21.370
By the way, Duke Sergiatte's recent favorite 
foods are seaweed salad and dorayaki.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.380
Before bed, he has a glass of warm milk.

18:25.310 --> 18:26.840
W-Wait a second.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.550
How do you know all that?

18:28.550 --> 18:30.630
Did you sneak into the castle or something?

18:31.370 --> 18:32.840
Lenessia told me.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
Huh?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.530
I got this information using my feminine skills.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.900
Feminine skills...

18:39.900 --> 18:42.750
Do you doubt my feminine skills?

18:42.750 --> 18:44.470
No, not really...

18:44.740 --> 18:47.380
My feminine skills are amazing!

18:47.380 --> 18:48.390
Are they?

18:48.390 --> 18:50.170
I even went to a girls' night out.

18:51.910 --> 18:52.730
Well?

18:52.990 --> 18:57.070
"Well"? I think it's good to have friends...

18:57.440 --> 18:59.300
Indeed, it is.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.570
Then, continuing my report...

19:01.270 --> 19:05.790
The well-regarded Duke Sergiatte is the Cowen 
family head and is sixty years old.

19:05.790 --> 19:08.200
His wife has already passed away.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.340
When he was young, he led the 
knights against monsters...

19:12.020 --> 19:13.560
What's wrong, my lord?

19:14.160 --> 19:16.400
You look unhappy, as usual.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.930
Oh, well. You see...

19:19.610 --> 19:22.130
Reports from the chief have stopped coming in.

19:22.130 --> 19:23.510
From the old master?

19:23.510 --> 19:24.950
That's rare.

19:24.950 --> 19:26.890
He isn't responding to telepathy, either.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.320
Is that possible?

19:29.320 --> 19:30.900
No, not normally.

19:31.610 --> 19:35.250
It makes me a little worried 
about Minori and the gang.

19:36.420 --> 19:38.560
He isn't picking up on telepathy.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.360
Yeah.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.790
I wanted to talk to him about something...

19:41.790 --> 19:43.270
<i>This is strange.</i>

19:43.270 --> 19:44.430
<i>When did this start?</i>

19:46.960 --> 19:48.370
Maybe...

19:48.370 --> 19:51.200
And I don't know if it's a side effect of that,

19:51.200 --> 19:54.130
but I'm told it disturbs the voices 
of adventurers' hearts.

19:54.710 --> 19:56.800
Did she mean telepathy?

19:58.590 --> 20:02.100
That mobile temple might somehow 
be affecting things.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.890
Then let's ask the knights.

20:05.340 --> 20:06.770
They look a little scary,

20:06.770 --> 20:09.960
but they're protecting the People of the Land.

20:09.960 --> 20:10.890
Yeah.

20:13.150 --> 20:15.080
If only Shiroe were here.

20:16.910 --> 20:18.130
That's no good.

20:18.130 --> 20:21.240
We decided to try to avoid relying on him 
and the others as much as we could.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.740
You're right.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.750
You dislike me, don't you, Tohya?

20:27.750 --> 20:29.000
No, I don't.

20:29.730 --> 20:32.500
Then why would you say something like that?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.110
That's...

20:42.960 --> 20:45.420
By the way, what's Roe 2 going to do?

20:45.420 --> 20:47.220
Yeah, I wonder, too.

20:47.220 --> 20:49.590
She said she was going to Ikoma.

20:49.590 --> 20:51.980
Maybe she'll go with Dariella?

20:52.230 --> 20:54.910
Isuzu won't leave her room, either.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.730
Maybe something happened with Rudy.

20:58.310 --> 21:03.930
If Roe 2 will be splitting up with us, 
we can't rely on her summons.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.700
We need to find a place to 
repair our summon flutes.

21:08.440 --> 21:09.800
Serara?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.490
What's that?

21:12.210 --> 21:14.500
It looks like black clouds...

21:17.520 --> 21:20.260
No, that isn't a cloud.

21:24.070 --> 21:25.440
Those are wyverns!

21:26.190 --> 21:28.430
They're heading straight for this town!

21:28.680 --> 21:30.890
This is bad...

21:32.800 --> 21:35.920
Hide somewhere safe, Dariella!

21:35.920 --> 21:38.190
What are you going to do?

21:39.610 --> 21:41.780
<i>What the heck is going on?</i>

21:59.420 --> 22:00.960
Individual levels confirmed.

22:01.250 --> 22:05.470
<b>Wyvern 
Rank/Normal</b>

22:01.610 --> 22:05.470
42, 46, 43, 50!

22:05.680 --> 22:07.670
What do we do, Minori?

22:07.670 --> 22:11.450
Regardless of their levels, 
we can't handle that many!

22:11.450 --> 22:12.970
Minori! Serara!

22:13.010 --> 22:14.080
Tohya!

22:14.080 --> 22:15.760
We have to get out of town for now.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.700
We can't let this place become a battlefield!

22:17.700 --> 22:18.440
But...

22:18.440 --> 22:19.230
Hurry!

22:19.230 --> 22:20.380
All right.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.820
Let's go, Serara.

22:21.820 --> 22:22.730
Yeah!

24:06.000 --> 24:09.900
The Odyssey Knights stand against the 
wyvern horde attacking the town.

24:09.900 --> 24:15.510
They fight not to protect, 
but to risk their lives in a horrific battle.

24:15.510 --> 24:17.570
Tohya and the others are frozen stiff.

24:17.570 --> 24:19.940
But Isuzu and Rudy run...

24:20.290 --> 24:22.730
To challenge a god to a fight.

24:22.730 --> 24:29.940
<b>The Red Night</b>

24:23.190 --> 24:24.880
Next time: The Red Night.

24:25.190 --> 24:27.270
I have friends to run with me.
