02:54.946 --> 02:56.145
Hey, Jer.

02:56.147 --> 02:57.981
Morning, roomie.

02:57.983 --> 02:59.115
Hey, what's all this?

02:59.117 --> 03:00.917
Oh, just prepping
for my interview

03:00.919 --> 03:02.118
at InoTech.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.087
Ani here is my
I.T. consultant.

03:04.089 --> 03:05.488
Wait a minute.

03:05.490 --> 03:06.923
Shouldn't you be in school,
little man?

03:06.925 --> 03:09.626
Why? Just to be force-fed
more misinformation?

03:09.628 --> 03:11.527
It can wait.

03:11.529 --> 03:13.463
Ani and I have more important
things to worry about.

03:13.465 --> 03:15.598
This new gig I applied for
requires programming skills,

03:15.600 --> 03:17.367
and I know nothing
about programming.

03:17.369 --> 03:19.168
Well, maybe that means
you're not the right man

03:19.170 --> 03:20.270
for the job.

03:20.272 --> 03:21.304
That's the problem.

03:21.306 --> 03:22.505
I'm not the right man
for any job.

03:22.507 --> 03:23.906
And since my mom
took off to Maui,

03:23.908 --> 03:25.975
I figure I need
at least 50K a year

03:25.977 --> 03:28.444
to move out of this place
and get my own.

03:28.446 --> 03:30.680
Oh, and I need a small loan.

03:30.682 --> 03:34.350
Just 20 bucks to pay
said I.T. consultant.

03:34.352 --> 03:37.420
The financials that we discussed
are non-negotiable, Jerry.

03:37.422 --> 03:38.521
Don't worry.

03:38.523 --> 03:39.589
Chin's good for it.

03:39.591 --> 03:42.025
Or maybe I just call
your parents

03:42.027 --> 03:43.493
and let them know
you're ditching school.

03:43.495 --> 03:46.062
Shrewd negotiator.

03:47.032 --> 03:49.399
Good luck, Jerry.

03:51.670 --> 03:53.603
Well, I got to jet anyways.

03:53.605 --> 03:55.004
Oh, listen.

03:55.006 --> 03:58.141
If InoTech calls, I was a coder
at your company for seven years.

03:58.143 --> 03:59.175
What company?

03:59.177 --> 04:00.910
Your global
import-export business.

04:00.912 --> 04:03.246
By the way,
you're incredibly successful.

04:10.255 --> 04:11.321
Come on, big guy.

04:11.323 --> 04:12.889
That the best you got?

04:14.893 --> 04:15.825
Better?

04:15.827 --> 04:16.993
It's good, but your hips

04:16.995 --> 04:18.060
are telegraphing your jab.

04:18.063 --> 04:19.661
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.

04:20.565 --> 04:22.198
Told you.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.466
Nice hook.

04:23.468 --> 04:26.002
Did you learn that
in law school?

04:26.004 --> 04:27.704
Actually,
I was club boxing champ

04:27.706 --> 04:28.938
my junior year of college.

04:28.940 --> 04:30.707
That right hook came in handy
with the boys.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.308
Oh, yeah?

04:32.310 --> 04:34.544
Lucky me, saved by the bell.

04:34.546 --> 04:36.512
Let's say we get some
water, Mayweather?

04:39.284 --> 04:42.518
So you ever gonna
give me an answer?

04:43.621 --> 04:44.987
About your friend?

04:44.989 --> 04:46.889
Yeah.

04:48.193 --> 04:49.859
Not gonna let
that go, are you?

04:49.861 --> 04:51.427
No. No, I'm not.
No?

04:51.429 --> 04:53.463
I'm telling you,
you and Jess are perfect

04:53.465 --> 04:54.630

04:54.632 --> 04:55.765
There's no such thing, Ellie.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.667
Come on,
her favorite movie is

04:57.669 --> 04:59.202
<i>Guns of Navarone,</i> she supports
the Second Amendment,

04:59.204 --> 05:01.270
and she spends
her weekends surfing.

05:01.272 --> 05:02.939
Not to mention
that she's drop-dead gorgeous.

05:02.941 --> 05:04.807
Drop-dead gorgeous?
Yeah.

05:04.809 --> 05:07.443
I never saw
<i>The Guns of Navarone.</i>

05:07.445 --> 05:09.712
Come on, Steve, say yes.
It'll be good for you.

05:09.714 --> 05:12.715
Look, I really appreciate
what you're trying to do, okay?

05:12.717 --> 05:15.118
But right now, I-I'm
just taking my time.

05:16.287 --> 05:18.287
Excuse me.

05:20.291 --> 05:21.491
Yeah?

05:23.361 --> 05:26.329
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

05:26.331 --> 05:27.830
I cannot let you
be set up, okay?

05:27.832 --> 05:29.732
I got two words for you:
Patty Fitzgerald.

05:29.734 --> 05:30.967
Who's Patty Fitzgerald?

05:30.969 --> 05:33.169
Patty Fitzgerald is someone
that my aunt set me up with

05:33.171 --> 05:34.570
when I was 19 years old, okay?

05:34.572 --> 05:35.905
I was single, I was young.

05:35.907 --> 05:37.974
I figured why not?
Big mistake?

05:37.976 --> 05:39.342
It was a colossal mistake.

05:39.344 --> 05:41.944
What happened?
Trust me, you do not want to know.

05:44.516 --> 05:46.015
Hey, Dr. Shaw.

05:46.017 --> 05:47.450
Gentlemen.

05:47.452 --> 05:49.018
You okay?

05:49.020 --> 05:50.319
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

05:50.321 --> 05:52.388
Dr. Bergman's waiting
for you guys inside.

05:52.390 --> 05:54.323
I'll be there
in just a minute.

05:54.325 --> 05:56.159
Please, I'll join you guys

05:56.161 --> 05:58.394
in a moment.
Okay.

06:00.698 --> 06:01.798
What's wrong
with Dr. Shaw?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.966
I don't know.
She appeared to be upset

06:03.968 --> 06:05.735
after we concluded
the autopsy on our victim.

06:05.737 --> 06:06.969
Did she say why?

06:06.971 --> 06:09.372
I chose not to pry, but
she is still a trainee,

06:09.374 --> 06:11.274
and in our profession,
seeing the worst

06:11.276 --> 06:13.276
of humanity every day
can take a toll on you.

06:13.278 --> 06:16.145
All right,
what do we know about her?

06:16.147 --> 06:18.080
Our victim is
Brooke Waiakea.

06:18.082 --> 06:20.283
22 years old,
and she was found

06:20.285 --> 06:22.051
in a marinepod
earlier this morning.

06:22.053 --> 06:24.353
What's a marinepod?

06:24.355 --> 06:26.556
It's a unique containment system
for marine aquaculture,

06:26.558 --> 06:27.957
designed for
rough ocean conditions

06:27.959 --> 06:29.692
and a diversity
of species.

06:29.694 --> 06:31.394
I can take it from here,
Dr. Bergman.

06:31.396 --> 06:32.462
Are you sure?

06:32.464 --> 06:34.197
Yes, thanks.

06:37.769 --> 06:40.636
It's likely our victim was in
the water for roughly six hours.

06:40.638 --> 06:42.905
I put her time of death
around midnight.

06:42.907 --> 06:45.408
C.O.D. was a single
gunshot wound to the head.

06:45.410 --> 06:46.909
Okay.

06:46.911 --> 06:49.812
Looks like some powder burn
around the entry point there.

06:49.814 --> 06:50.913
Close-contact wound.

06:50.915 --> 06:52.381
That's right.

06:52.383 --> 06:53.883
You find any other trauma?

06:53.885 --> 06:56.486
Nothing,
and no defensive wounds.

06:56.488 --> 06:57.687
So she was executed.

06:58.823 --> 07:01.023
Yeah, Duke, what's up?

07:02.093 --> 07:04.660
All right, thank you.
Thanks.

07:04.662 --> 07:07.330
Looks like Pier 54
recovered Brooke's car.

07:07.332 --> 07:09.632
CSU sent it over
to HPD impound for processing.

07:09.634 --> 07:10.733
Thanks.

07:10.735 --> 07:13.503
All right, let us know
if you find anything else.

07:13.505 --> 07:15.438
Will do.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.941
That's the one right there.

07:21.613 --> 07:23.346
Hey, Five-O!

07:23.348 --> 07:25.348
Show me your
hands. Hands.

07:25.350 --> 07:26.916
Turn around slow,
keep your hands up.

07:28.486 --> 07:30.553
Morning, fellas.

07:31.356 --> 07:33.556
Stay right there.

07:38.363 --> 07:39.896
GPS tracker.

07:39.898 --> 07:41.731
I can explain that.

07:46.638 --> 07:47.904
Got a piece.

07:50.074 --> 07:51.908
Smith & Wesson 36.

07:51.910 --> 07:54.977
Well, I can explain that, too.

07:54.979 --> 07:56.345
I'm all ears.

08:08.979 --> 08:12.547
<i> You find yourself in a room</i>
<i>with four walls and no windows.</i>

08:12.549 --> 08:15.416
<i>You've either committed a crime</i>
<i>or know something about one.</i>

08:15.418 --> 08:18.353
<i>If you're guilty,</i>
<i>you might as well come clean,</i>

08:18.355 --> 08:21.122
<i>because the man</i>
<i>will sweat it out of you.</i>

08:21.124 --> 08:25.293
<i>But if you're innocent and</i>
<i>you know something they don't,</i>

08:25.295 --> 08:26.895
<i>well, that's a different story.</i>

08:29.766 --> 08:32.100
There you are.

08:32.102 --> 08:34.302
I was starting to get lonely.

08:44.014 --> 08:45.513
We ran your prints.

08:45.515 --> 08:46.714
Your name's Harry Brown.

08:46.716 --> 08:50.051
30 years with the HPD, huh?

08:50.053 --> 08:52.153
You had a hell of a career, too;
highly decorated officer.

08:52.155 --> 08:56.024
And if I might add,
poker buddies with your old man.

08:56.026 --> 08:57.425
Why didn't you just

08:57.427 --> 08:59.928
tell us who you were?

08:59.930 --> 09:01.429
I figured,
under the circumstance,

09:01.431 --> 09:03.731
we'd end up here anyway.
Besides, I missed the place.

09:04.768 --> 09:07.869
We also know you're
a P.I. licensed to carry.

09:07.871 --> 09:09.137
Told you I could explain
the heater.

09:09.139 --> 09:10.204
It also explains

09:10.206 --> 09:12.507
why you were trespassing
in HPD impound.

09:12.509 --> 09:15.443
You were illegally
tracking Brooke, weren't you?

09:15.445 --> 09:17.111
Also, you knew

09:17.113 --> 09:18.780
the GPS would lead back to you.

09:18.782 --> 09:20.315
I couldn't just leave it there.

09:20.317 --> 09:21.683
Who, uh...

09:21.685 --> 09:23.251
who hired you to follow Brooke?

09:23.253 --> 09:26.521
No one. I was doing it
as a favor for her father.

09:26.523 --> 09:29.591
An old Coast Guard buddy of mine
from way back when.

09:29.593 --> 09:31.492
He lives on Lana'i.

09:31.494 --> 09:33.695
About six moths ago,

09:33.697 --> 09:36.564
his only daughter packed
her bags and moved to Oahu,

09:36.566 --> 09:39.267
pursue big city dreams.

09:39.269 --> 09:41.235
At first, it was copacetic.

09:41.237 --> 09:43.871
They talked every day.

09:43.873 --> 09:46.307
Well, as soon as the calls
started to dwindle

09:46.309 --> 09:50.645
and the father asked why,
you know, she got cagey.

09:50.647 --> 09:52.647
All right, so you figured
you'd do your Coast Guard buddy

09:52.649 --> 09:54.449
a favor and come out here
and check it out?

09:54.451 --> 09:56.284
Well, I woke up this morning,

09:56.286 --> 09:59.621
I saw that the GPS signal was
coming from the police impound.

09:59.623 --> 10:01.122
I knew something was wrong.

10:01.124 --> 10:02.357
And you thought you'd get

10:02.359 --> 10:05.293
the information off the GPS,
locate Brooke's killer

10:05.295 --> 10:06.461
and deal with it yourself.

10:06.463 --> 10:08.730
More or less.

10:08.732 --> 10:11.299
But I would've
left them breathing.

10:11.301 --> 10:14.302
Okay, why did Brooke
stop calling home?

10:14.304 --> 10:15.637
My guess is she was ashamed.

10:15.639 --> 10:17.138
Of what?
She got herself

10:17.140 --> 10:20.074
a job as a dancer
at a local hula company.

10:20.076 --> 10:22.977
Sounds innocent enough,
except for the part

10:22.979 --> 10:25.279
that it's a front
for an escort service.

10:25.281 --> 10:27.415
Call Vice. See if they got
anything on that.

10:27.417 --> 10:29.017
They do. They're running
a joint investigation

10:29.019 --> 10:32.220
right now
with the P.A.'s office.

10:32.222 --> 10:35.156
So far, they haven't been able
to build a case.

10:35.158 --> 10:37.091
All right,
explain something to me, Harry.

10:37.093 --> 10:38.860
If you knew all this
was going on,

10:38.862 --> 10:40.161
why didn't you pull Brooke out?

10:41.498 --> 10:44.265
Who said I didn't try?

10:44.267 --> 10:47.135
She was a tough kid,
just like her old man.

10:47.137 --> 10:49.404
She told me she could
take care of herself.

10:49.406 --> 10:52.306
And like a jackass,
I believed her.

10:52.308 --> 10:54.509
I should've
never let her

10:54.511 --> 10:55.710
out of my sight,

10:55.712 --> 10:58.079
because now I got to call
her father

10:58.081 --> 11:02.216
and tell him that his baby girl
was murdered on my watch.

11:06.690 --> 11:08.690
<i>Aloha.</i>

11:08.692 --> 11:10.591
I'm Brooke Waiakea.

11:10.593 --> 11:12.727
I'm 22 years old, and I grew up

11:12.729 --> 11:14.195
on the beautiful
island of Lanai,

11:14.197 --> 11:16.798
dreaming of becoming
a hula dancer.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.167
And now I get to share
that dream with you.

11:19.169 --> 11:21.469
So come check us out.

11:21.471 --> 11:22.670
Okay.

11:22.672 --> 11:24.505
So what do we know about
the Manoa Hula Company?

11:24.507 --> 11:25.907
Well, on the surface,
everything appears

11:25.909 --> 11:27.208
to be kosher.

11:27.210 --> 11:29.610
They hire these dancers
for private events,

11:29.612 --> 11:32.413
corporate outings,
graduation parties, etcetera.

11:32.415 --> 11:33.915
But according to
the P.A.'s office,

11:33.917 --> 11:35.783
the clients who are in
the know go to the Web site,

11:35.785 --> 11:36.984
where all the dancers
have a profile page

11:36.986 --> 11:38.319
just like the
one we saw.

11:38.321 --> 11:39.387
It's like a menu.

11:39.389 --> 11:41.956
You pick the dancer you want,
you call up

11:41.958 --> 11:43.091
the hula manager,

11:43.093 --> 11:45.193
she sets the whole
thing up for you.

11:45.195 --> 11:47.895
So I ran the GPS that your man
Harry planted on our vic's car.

11:47.897 --> 11:49.697
It shows that
she left her place

11:49.699 --> 11:51.866
around 2:00 a.m.
and went to Pier 54.

11:51.868 --> 11:53.367
Which would be impossible,

11:53.369 --> 11:56.904
since Dr. Shaw puts T.O.D.
right around midnight.

11:56.906 --> 11:58.306
So the killer was
driving her car.

11:58.308 --> 12:00.074
That's what I thought, too,
so I had CSU

12:00.076 --> 12:01.375
do one last sweep of her car,

12:01.377 --> 12:03.010
looking for any fingerprint
or DNA evidence.

12:03.012 --> 12:04.545
They came up empty.

12:04.547 --> 12:07.014
So I'm having them canvass
all the boats in the marina

12:07.016 --> 12:08.282
and check video surveillance.

12:08.284 --> 12:10.818
Yeah, but why dump Brooke
in the marinepod

12:10.820 --> 12:12.987
when you got the whole
Pacific Ocean out there?

12:12.989 --> 12:16.624
Marinepod guarantees
that she'll be found.

12:16.626 --> 12:18.726
That's what our
killer wanted.

12:31.207 --> 12:34.475
Have you gotten in touch
with Brooke's father?

12:34.477 --> 12:36.477
They're extremely close.
He's going to be devastated.

12:36.479 --> 12:37.745
Yeah, we're, uh,

12:37.747 --> 12:40.414
reaching out to him now.

12:40.416 --> 12:42.617
Ms. Thompson, when was the
last time you saw Brooke?

12:42.619 --> 12:44.118
It was last night.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.254
We had a corporate event
at The Modern.

12:46.256 --> 12:48.656
Okay, we're going to need a list
of everybody who was there.

12:48.658 --> 12:49.957
Of course.

12:49.959 --> 12:51.959
Do you know
if Brooke, uh,

12:51.961 --> 12:53.895
took any work home
with her last night?

12:53.897 --> 12:55.663
Excuse me?

12:55.665 --> 12:58.132
Ms. Thompson, we know your
company's under investigation.

12:58.134 --> 13:00.168
That is nothing more

13:00.170 --> 13:02.804
than jealous competitors
trying to slander my name.

13:02.806 --> 13:04.272
So you're saying
that your dancers,

13:04.274 --> 13:06.374
they never have relationships
with clients outside of work?

13:06.376 --> 13:08.643
I did not say that.

13:08.645 --> 13:11.179
My dancers are
beautiful women.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.781
If a client calls asking
to meet one of them,

13:13.783 --> 13:14.916
I am not above

13:14.918 --> 13:17.084
making an introduction.
Yeah, of course not.

13:18.521 --> 13:20.421
Matchmaking has been around

13:20.423 --> 13:22.590
for thousands of years,
gentlemen.

13:22.592 --> 13:24.959
It's an ancient tradition
that kings and queens used

13:24.961 --> 13:26.527
to set up their children.

13:26.529 --> 13:27.762
There's no money exchanged.

13:27.764 --> 13:28.963
Nothing illegal about it.

13:28.965 --> 13:31.432
But you do charge
four times more

13:31.434 --> 13:32.867
than your
competitors, right?

13:32.869 --> 13:34.769
Quality comes with a price.

13:34.771 --> 13:37.238
Yeah, well, so does being
an accessory to murder, okay?

13:37.240 --> 13:38.306
So you're either gonna tell us

13:38.308 --> 13:39.640
who Brooke went home
with last night,

13:39.642 --> 13:40.808
or we're gonna
book you right now

13:40.810 --> 13:43.077
for withholding
evidence.

13:49.252 --> 13:50.451
David Waring.

13:50.453 --> 13:52.286
He's been a client
for about a year.

13:52.288 --> 13:55.790
After the event...
Brooke went out with him.

13:55.792 --> 13:56.924
Okay.

13:56.926 --> 13:58.459
Has he ever been rough
with any of your girls?

13:58.461 --> 14:00.428
No. Never.

14:00.430 --> 14:01.762
Okay, well, last night,

14:01.764 --> 14:03.898
it looks like he made
an exception to that.

14:09.138 --> 14:11.672
Okay, so the neighbors
didn't hear or see anything.

14:11.674 --> 14:13.107
What about in here?

14:13.109 --> 14:14.809
Take a look.

14:16.613 --> 14:19.413
Looks like Brooke
was going somewhere.

14:19.415 --> 14:21.182
Okay, so maybe she knew
she was in danger

14:21.184 --> 14:23.284
- and decided to leave town.
- Hey!

14:23.286 --> 14:24.452
This is my apartment.

14:24.454 --> 14:25.720
I want to know
what's going on.

14:25.722 --> 14:27.121
Why are the police here?
What happened?

14:27.123 --> 14:29.023
Excuse me.
Why won't you tell me anything?

14:29.025 --> 14:30.224
Who are you?

14:30.226 --> 14:31.559
I'm Annie, Brooke's roommate.

14:31.561 --> 14:32.927
What's going on? Where is she?

14:39.669 --> 14:41.802
I left the party before Brooke.

14:41.804 --> 14:43.170
Stayed out all night.

14:43.172 --> 14:44.672
When I got up this morning,

14:44.674 --> 14:47.475
I saw some missed calls
from her, but...

14:47.477 --> 14:49.010
I didn't think
anything was wrong.

14:49.012 --> 14:51.245
We know that Brooke
left the party

14:51.247 --> 14:52.780
with a man named
David Waring.

14:52.782 --> 14:54.115
Do you know him?

14:54.117 --> 14:56.317
No.

14:56.319 --> 14:58.986
We know all about
the company you work for.

14:58.988 --> 15:01.956
It's important for you
to cooperate with us.

15:01.958 --> 15:03.491
You need to tell us
what you know.

15:03.493 --> 15:05.159
It's not what people think.

15:05.161 --> 15:06.928
We don't have to do anything
we don't want to.

15:06.930 --> 15:10.031
Rich men just like
to buy us gifts,

15:10.033 --> 15:11.399
trips, dinners...

15:11.401 --> 15:12.967
Rich men like David Waring?

15:12.969 --> 15:14.735
And in return,

15:14.737 --> 15:15.737
you sleep with them.

15:15.738 --> 15:16.904
It's not just

15:16.906 --> 15:18.005
about sex.

15:18.007 --> 15:20.408
Some are just lonely
and they want company.

15:20.410 --> 15:23.978
And Brooke never slept
with any of them.

15:23.980 --> 15:26.314
I know how
it sounds,

15:26.316 --> 15:28.182
but Brooke wasn't like that.

15:28.184 --> 15:30.718
She just went out with
the clients to keep her job.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.320
If things started
moving too fast,

15:32.322 --> 15:34.388
she'd just... back off.

15:34.390 --> 15:35.389
Well, maybe Waring
didn't think

15:35.391 --> 15:36.671
he was getting
his money's worth.

15:38.928 --> 15:40.995
I've been out with David.

15:40.997 --> 15:42.596
He's not the aggressive type.

15:42.598 --> 15:43.931
But I know who is.

15:43.933 --> 15:45.766
A man named

15:45.768 --> 15:46.934
Cory Kaniaupio.

15:46.936 --> 15:48.703
He and Brooke dated
for a few years.

15:48.705 --> 15:51.272
He even asked her to marry him,
but she said no.

15:51.274 --> 15:53.874
She didn't want to settle
before she had a chance

15:53.876 --> 15:55.109
to live out her dreams.

15:55.111 --> 15:57.845
That's why she moved to Oahu
to be a dancer.

15:57.847 --> 15:59.880
I suppose Cory didn't
take that well.

15:59.882 --> 16:03.417
He showed up a few days ago
from Lanai.

16:03.419 --> 16:04.785
He just kept calling Brooke

16:04.787 --> 16:07.788
and leaving messages
and texts, and...

16:07.790 --> 16:11.792
he came over the other night
and he was really pissed.

16:11.794 --> 16:14.729
He kept telling Brooke that
she had to leave with him and...

16:14.731 --> 16:17.398
Brooke said she was gonna
call the police, so he left.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.300
That's the last time I saw him.

16:19.302 --> 16:20.735
Do you think
he heard her

16:20.737 --> 16:22.036
and backed off?

16:23.072 --> 16:25.806
I think he wasn't gonna
take no for an answer.

16:30.580 --> 16:31.645
Chin, what's up?

16:31.647 --> 16:33.147
You talk to Waring yet?

16:33.149 --> 16:35.549
No, we're, uh...
we're just about to pull up

16:35.551 --> 16:37.251
to his house now. Why?

16:37.253 --> 16:38.686
'Cause he might not be our guy.

16:38.688 --> 16:39.787
Brooke's ex-boyfriend Cory

16:39.789 --> 16:41.589
showed up from Lanai
a few days ago.

16:41.591 --> 16:43.257
Yeah, we think he was
following her last night.

16:43.259 --> 16:44.959
He tried to get her
to leave town with him,

16:44.961 --> 16:46.460
but when she refused,
he killed her.

16:46.462 --> 16:47.661
Hey, this ex-boyfriend--

16:47.663 --> 16:50.498
he about six feet tall,
brown hair, surfer-type?

16:50.500 --> 16:51.866
Yeah, how'd you know?

16:51.868 --> 16:53.748
Uh, 'cause he just walked
out of Waring's house.

16:56.372 --> 16:57.638
Hey, Cory!

16:57.640 --> 16:59.306
Show us your hands.

17:00.309 --> 17:02.710
Show me your hands right now!
Hands. Hands.

17:03.579 --> 17:05.945
What did you do, Cory? Huh?

17:05.948 --> 17:07.580
What did you do?
Where's David?

17:07.583 --> 17:08.549
Huh?

17:08.550 --> 17:10.351
Danny, stay with him.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.253
All right, get
on your knees.

17:19.896 --> 17:22.096
David Waring!

17:25.867 --> 17:28.069
David Waring?

17:29.739 --> 17:32.173
David.

17:39.782 --> 17:41.315
Steve, you find him?

17:41.317 --> 17:42.683
Is he in there?

17:45.288 --> 17:47.488
Sorta.

17:58.737 --> 18:00.072
<i>Do this job long enough,</i>

18:00.073 --> 18:02.173
<i>you come to understand</i>
<i>that there are a lot of reasons</i>

18:02.175 --> 18:04.742
<i>someone gets zipped up in</i>
<i>one of those nifty black bags.</i>

18:04.744 --> 18:08.312
<i>And at the top of that list</i>
<i>is good old-fashioned love.</i>

18:08.314 --> 18:13.484
<i>When Cupid gets it wrong,</i>
<i>good-byes tend to be messy.</i>

18:18.925 --> 18:21.058
How could you think
I'd hurt Brooke?

18:21.060 --> 18:22.393
I loved her.

18:22.395 --> 18:23.494
Yeah, you loved her enough

18:23.496 --> 18:25.062
to make sure nobody else
could have her.

18:25.064 --> 18:26.230
No.

18:26.232 --> 18:29.567
No, you're wrong.

18:29.569 --> 18:30.968
Who are you anyway?

18:30.970 --> 18:32.303
You're not wearing a badge.

18:32.305 --> 18:33.604
Yeah, well, not having one

18:33.606 --> 18:35.706
just means I don't have
to worry about losing it.

18:35.708 --> 18:36.741
Trust me, all right?

18:36.743 --> 18:37.842
You don't want
to piss this guy off.

18:37.844 --> 18:38.924
Just tell us what happened.

18:41.347 --> 18:44.749
Look, I'm not trying
to lie to you.

18:44.751 --> 18:46.250
I <i> was</i> following Brooke.

18:46.252 --> 18:48.719
I saw her leave the
party with some guy

18:48.721 --> 18:50.354
and go back
to his house.

18:50.356 --> 18:53.657
I got so angry, I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

18:53.659 --> 18:57.161
Figured I'd lost her forever.

18:57.163 --> 18:59.830
So I got as far away
from that place as I could.

18:59.832 --> 19:02.633
Ducked into a bar
in Chinatown--

19:02.635 --> 19:05.503
O'Toole's on Nu'uanu.

19:05.505 --> 19:08.672
Drank until the place closed.

19:08.674 --> 19:10.875
Passed out in my car.

19:10.877 --> 19:12.476
Yeah, well,
that's a nice story, kid.

19:12.478 --> 19:14.879
Only, you left out the part
where my new friend here

19:14.881 --> 19:16.947
found you with Waring's blood
on your hands.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.949
We know David Waring's family

19:18.951 --> 19:20.217
owns the marinepod,

19:20.219 --> 19:21.552
which is why you dumped
Brooke's body there.

19:21.554 --> 19:23.220
To humiliate David, right?
The way he humiliated you.

19:23.222 --> 19:25.756
But that wasn't enough for you,
was it? You had to kill him.

19:25.758 --> 19:26.924
I swear, I didn't touch
any of them.

19:26.926 --> 19:28.826
I was at the guy's
house this morning

19:28.828 --> 19:30.795
just to tell him to
stay away from Brooke.

19:30.797 --> 19:33.397
But when he didn't answer...

19:33.399 --> 19:35.833
I went inside.

19:35.835 --> 19:38.536
Found him on the floor.

19:38.538 --> 19:40.271
He was
already dead.

19:57.790 --> 20:00.624
You know what?

20:00.626 --> 20:02.760
I believe you, kid.

20:06.232 --> 20:10.034
<i> Look into a man's eyes,</i>
<i>and they'll tell you the truth,</i>

20:10.036 --> 20:13.070
<i>even if he doesn't</i>
<i>want them to.</i>

20:13.072 --> 20:15.106
<i>Cory was no murderer.</i>

20:15.108 --> 20:18.476
<i>He was just a lovelorn kid</i>
<i>with a busted heart.</i>

20:20.980 --> 20:22.046
CSU still hasn't recovered
Brooke's cell phone.

20:22.048 --> 20:23.714
We're pulling her
records right now.

20:23.716 --> 20:25.082
But we did find Cory's.

20:25.084 --> 20:26.450
Now, the battery was dead,

20:26.452 --> 20:28.486
and when we recharged it, there
was a voice mail from Brooke

20:28.488 --> 20:30.221
that he hadn't
heard yet.

20:30.223 --> 20:32.156
Cory, it's me.

20:32.158 --> 20:34.291
Call me back
as soon as you get this.

20:34.293 --> 20:35.826
I need you.

20:35.828 --> 20:38.062
She sounds scared,
but not of Cory.

20:38.064 --> 20:39.730
What time
she leave that message?

20:39.732 --> 20:41.432
10:05.

20:41.434 --> 20:43.434
And we know she was killed
around midnight, right?

20:43.436 --> 20:44.668
What are you thinking?

20:44.670 --> 20:45.703
Cory just told us

20:45.705 --> 20:46.937
he was drinking at O'Toole's,

20:46.939 --> 20:48.572
in Chinatown.

20:48.574 --> 20:51.742
Now, if we can place him there
in that two-hour window,

20:51.744 --> 20:53.043
that means
he's telling the truth

20:53.045 --> 20:54.879
and our killer is
still out there.

20:59.185 --> 21:03.187
Mr. Waring was murdered
between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m.

21:03.189 --> 21:05.222
C.O.D. appears to be
blunt force trauma.

21:05.224 --> 21:06.924
I didn't find
any defensive wounds,

21:06.926 --> 21:08.359
which suggests the poor guy
never saw it coming.

21:08.361 --> 21:10.794
Okay. Between 9:00 and 10:00?
Are you sure about that?

21:10.796 --> 21:12.096
Yeah. Why?

21:12.098 --> 21:13.831
Well, uh,
'cause that's two hours

21:13.833 --> 21:14.999
before Brooke was killed.

21:15.001 --> 21:16.567
All right?

21:16.569 --> 21:18.135
So maybe this guy was the target

21:18.137 --> 21:19.670
and, uh, she was
just collateral.

21:19.672 --> 21:22.306
CSU find a
murder weapon?

21:22.308 --> 21:24.475
Not yet. I'm still analyzing

21:24.477 --> 21:25.609
the skull fracture.
But once I'm finished,

21:25.611 --> 21:27.178
I may be able
to determine what it was.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.046
Okay. Well, let me know.

21:29.048 --> 21:30.714
Will do.

21:32.251 --> 21:34.151
Thanks.

21:34.153 --> 21:35.519
All right,
nice work.

21:35.521 --> 21:37.454
Thank you.

21:37.456 --> 21:39.690
Hey. Uh, it's, uh,

21:39.692 --> 21:40.858
nice to see that
you're feeling better.

21:40.860 --> 21:42.626
Yeah, thanks.

21:43.996 --> 21:46.497
Bit of a "my bad" situation
this morning.

21:46.499 --> 21:47.831
No, look, uh...
it's understandable.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.133
I mean, working
that close with Max

21:49.135 --> 21:51.268
would bring anybody to tears.

21:51.270 --> 21:53.037
See? Look at that. That's a very
nice smile. That's much better.

21:53.039 --> 21:54.772
Bit of an odd one, isn't he?

21:54.774 --> 21:56.807
Yeah, he is, but that's, uh...
that's why we love him.

21:56.809 --> 21:58.742
Or at least like him a lot,
you know?

22:00.580 --> 22:03.147
Okay, uh, do
you mind, uh,

22:03.149 --> 22:06.150
if I ask you who Brooke
reminded you of?

22:06.152 --> 22:08.752
How did you know that?

22:08.754 --> 22:11.121
Know... Well, I, uh...
I've had this job

22:11.123 --> 22:13.657
for, uh, way too
long, I think.

22:18.631 --> 22:21.265
Susan Landon.

22:21.267 --> 22:24.501
Met on the first day
of freshman year.

22:24.503 --> 22:27.438
You know, one of those
people you just...

22:27.440 --> 22:30.908
you just click with right away?

22:30.910 --> 22:32.743
That was us.

22:37.049 --> 22:40.918
A few days before graduation,
we were out celebrating and...

22:40.920 --> 22:44.521
I left this club early
because, you know,

22:44.523 --> 22:47.157
that's me, but...

22:47.159 --> 22:49.693
Susan never came home.

22:49.695 --> 22:52.997
Next morning,
they found her in a river

22:52.999 --> 22:55.866
near campus.

22:55.868 --> 22:57.201
Police said she drowned,

22:57.203 --> 23:00.337
but the coroner never found
any water in her lungs.

23:02.108 --> 23:05.643
They ever, uh... they
ever find out who did it?

23:05.645 --> 23:07.845
No.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.316
Most days, I-I...
I don't let it bother me.

23:12.318 --> 23:13.484
But today I did.

23:13.486 --> 23:16.086
Look, uh...

23:16.088 --> 23:17.855
you know, that's the tough
part about this job.

23:17.857 --> 23:21.859
You know, somebody dies, that's
when we go to work, hmm?

23:22.695 --> 23:24.595
So how do you deal with it?

23:24.597 --> 23:27.498
Well, I, um... I got a...
I got a daughter.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.300
You know, a little girl.

23:29.302 --> 23:31.135
And when I, uh... when
I hang out with her,

23:31.137 --> 23:33.504
I'm-I'm able to just put
everything off to the side.

23:33.506 --> 23:34.605
Everything else, you know?

23:34.607 --> 23:36.206
Surfing. They say
surfing is good.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.408
You should try that maybe.

23:37.410 --> 23:38.876
I mean, I don't
understand it personally.

23:38.878 --> 23:40.644
Uh, it's not for me.
Some sort of an escape.

23:40.646 --> 23:43.113
That's what you
need, I think.

23:43.115 --> 23:45.983
Yeah. Thank you,
Detective Williams.

23:45.985 --> 23:47.751
Yeah, sure.

23:51.724 --> 23:53.691
<i>This guy Waring's got</i>

23:53.693 --> 23:55.459
no criminal record to speak of.

23:55.461 --> 23:58.228
But he wasn't exactly gonna win
any popularity contests, either.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.631
He was a defendant
in multiple lawsuits

24:00.633 --> 24:02.766
involving bad
real estate deals.

24:02.768 --> 24:04.802
The guy's been engaged I
don't know how many times

24:04.804 --> 24:06.236
over the last three years.

24:06.238 --> 24:08.238
The latest prize winner is

24:08.240 --> 24:09.973
the lovely Ms. Erica Young.

24:09.975 --> 24:11.442
Okay, we
need to find her.

24:11.444 --> 24:13.711
Maybe she can tell us
something about last night.

24:14.613 --> 24:16.080
Well, Cory's alibi checks out.

24:16.082 --> 24:18.148
He was at O'Toole's all night.

24:18.150 --> 24:19.917
I also went through
Brooke's cell phone records.

24:19.919 --> 24:22.286
The last call she made
was to a cab company,

24:22.288 --> 24:24.154
who told me
that they picked her up

24:24.156 --> 24:26.890
from Waring's house at 10:15

24:26.892 --> 24:28.592
and drove her home.

24:28.594 --> 24:30.694
That means she was there
when Waring was murdered.

24:30.696 --> 24:33.063
So, either the killer didn't
know she was in the house...

24:33.065 --> 24:34.732
You know, Brooke could be
the killer.

24:34.734 --> 24:35.799
No, I don't think so.

24:35.801 --> 24:37.468
When she left
that voice mail for Cory,

24:37.470 --> 24:39.136
she was whispering;
she sounded like she was

24:39.138 --> 24:40.604
afraid somebody would hear her.

24:40.606 --> 24:41.966
That could've been
Waring's killer.

24:44.343 --> 24:46.210
Cory, it's me.

24:46.212 --> 24:47.778
Huh.
Call me back as soon

24:47.780 --> 24:48.780
as you get this.

24:48.781 --> 24:50.214
I need you.

24:50.216 --> 24:51.281
Wait a minute.
You hear that?

24:51.283 --> 24:52.683
There's something
in the background.

24:54.053 --> 24:56.520
Cory, it's me.

24:56.522 --> 24:57.821
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

24:57.823 --> 24:58.789
You hear that?

24:58.791 --> 25:00.023
I need you.

25:00.025 --> 25:01.725
Yeah, Chin,
can you isolate that?

25:01.727 --> 25:02.626
Yeah.

25:02.628 --> 25:04.928
Cory, it's me.

25:04.930 --> 25:07.131
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

25:07.133 --> 25:08.265
I need you.

25:08.267 --> 25:09.533
Right there. You got it.

25:09.535 --> 25:11.368
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

25:11.370 --> 25:13.203
Call me back
as soon as you get this.

25:13.205 --> 25:14.538
It sounds like water dripping.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.407
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

25:25.651 --> 25:27.851
This is where Brooke
made the call.

25:45.004 --> 25:47.204
She witnessed the murder.

25:48.674 --> 25:51.141
Yeah, and she was killed
to cover it up.

26:05.424 --> 26:06.454
Wow.

26:06.455 --> 26:08.722
That's, uh... that's
nice, Gallagher.

26:08.724 --> 26:10.323
Oh, I don't think
she, uh... I don't think

26:10.325 --> 26:11.591
she knows who Gallagher is.

26:11.593 --> 26:13.560
Did he work here?
No, no. He was

26:13.562 --> 26:15.061
a comedian in the '80s;
he used to, uh,

26:15.063 --> 26:17.130
smash watermelons
with a sledgehammer.

26:17.132 --> 26:19.065
And people thought
that was funny?

26:19.067 --> 26:21.868
It was the '80s.

26:21.870 --> 26:23.336
What's with him?

26:23.338 --> 26:24.504
He is a little

26:24.506 --> 26:26.306
experiment I conducted.

26:26.308 --> 26:28.341
Now, David Waring was struck
three times

26:28.343 --> 26:30.343
in the parietal bone
with a rounded object.

26:30.345 --> 26:32.645
Unfortunately, no fragments
were found in the wound

26:32.647 --> 26:34.314
to tell us
what the murder weapon was.

26:34.316 --> 26:38.151
But I was able to determine
one thing about our killer.

26:38.153 --> 26:40.320
Their height.

26:42.124 --> 26:44.157
The ladder give it away,
I think.

26:44.159 --> 26:45.325
Nice detective work, Detective.

26:45.327 --> 26:47.360
Now, our killer

26:47.362 --> 26:48.628
is under six feet.

26:48.630 --> 26:49.929
First blow to Waring was fatal,

26:49.931 --> 26:51.765
which means his attacker
would've had to come down

26:51.767 --> 26:54.701
with a significant amount
of force and from a high angle.

26:54.703 --> 26:56.970
Like this.

27:03.812 --> 27:06.212
Wow.

27:06.214 --> 27:08.248
What is it--
100 mile-an-hour serve?

27:08.250 --> 27:10.316
She's killing that ball.
Yeah.

27:10.318 --> 27:13.253
Imagine what that could do
to your head.

27:13.255 --> 27:15.555
What?

27:30.672 --> 27:32.972
I just can't believe this.

27:32.974 --> 27:35.475
We just had lunch with him
yesterday afternoon.

27:36.444 --> 27:38.044
He can't be dead.

27:38.046 --> 27:40.413
Okay, uh, do you know anybody

27:40.415 --> 27:42.482
who would want to do
something like this to him?

27:42.484 --> 27:45.218
No.

27:45.220 --> 27:46.419
No, of course not.

27:46.421 --> 27:48.788
Okay.

27:48.790 --> 27:49.989
You ever seen
this woman before?

27:49.991 --> 27:51.658
You recognize her?

27:55.263 --> 27:57.263
Who is she?

27:57.265 --> 27:59.165
Her name is Brooke Waiakea.

27:59.167 --> 28:00.333
She was killed yesterday.

28:00.335 --> 28:02.168
And we have reason
to believe that her

28:02.170 --> 28:03.903
and David's murders are linked.

28:03.905 --> 28:07.207
I don't understand.

28:07.209 --> 28:09.175
Okay, look,
there's no easy way

28:09.177 --> 28:10.643
to put this.
Um... we believe

28:10.645 --> 28:12.011
that Brooke might've been
an escort

28:12.013 --> 28:14.113
and that David was
one of her clients.

28:19.855 --> 28:23.456
I know that he had been
with escorts in the past.

28:23.458 --> 28:25.225
Erica, what were
you thinking?

28:25.227 --> 28:28.995
He told me that he had
stopped, Dad. I...

28:28.997 --> 28:32.232
I knew what kind of man he was.
I thought he had changed.

28:32.234 --> 28:34.200
Okay, um...

28:34.202 --> 28:36.402
I'm sorry to have
to ask you this, but, uh,

28:36.404 --> 28:39.305
where were you last night
between 9:00 and 2:00 a.m.?

28:39.307 --> 28:41.708
She was having dinner
with my wife and I.

28:41.710 --> 28:42.710
Dad.

28:42.711 --> 28:44.244
She stayed at our house
last night.

28:44.246 --> 28:45.545
Dad, don't.

28:46.548 --> 28:48.948
I was home all night.

28:48.950 --> 28:50.483
Okay, was anybody with you?

28:50.485 --> 28:52.919
No.

28:52.921 --> 28:56.155
David had a business dinner.

28:56.157 --> 28:59.592
When he didn't show up
to my place after that,

28:59.594 --> 29:03.630
I assumed that it ran late
and he slept at his place.

29:09.437 --> 29:12.505
Listen, I had nothing
to do with this.

29:12.507 --> 29:15.608
David wasn't perfect,
but I loved him.

29:15.610 --> 29:19.078
I guess I made myself
believe he loved me, too.

29:41.803 --> 29:43.736
Can I help you?

29:43.738 --> 29:46.072
Yeah, I hope so.

29:46.074 --> 29:48.574
I was just passing by
and I saw your boat.

29:48.576 --> 29:52.278
I think I've seen it before
over by Pier 54.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.714
She's not for sale, partner.

29:54.716 --> 29:56.449
I didn't say I was here to buy.

29:57.552 --> 29:59.852
Then what do you want?

29:59.854 --> 30:02.789
I was down by the harbor
last night.

30:02.791 --> 30:05.291
I could swear I saw you
launch her,

30:05.293 --> 30:08.895
what was it,
about 2:00 a.m.?

30:08.897 --> 30:12.799
I think you got me confused
with somebody else.

30:12.801 --> 30:16.202
Now, why don't you get
the hell out of here?

30:16.204 --> 30:18.204
No.

30:18.206 --> 30:20.373
I think I got the right guy.

30:52.140 --> 30:54.374
Give me your arm, scumbag.

30:55.844 --> 30:57.577
Thanks for that.

30:57.579 --> 30:59.045
It's been a long time.

30:59.047 --> 31:01.814
Son of a bitch.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.082
Guy's name is
Richard Sheridan.

31:03.084 --> 31:04.784
He's a stock broker
that works out of his home.

31:04.786 --> 31:06.052
We're still running him
through the system.

31:06.054 --> 31:07.254
How the hell did you find him?

31:07.255 --> 31:08.921
There were tread marks
at the entry slip

31:08.923 --> 31:10.757
at Pier 54, so I
took an imprint.

31:10.759 --> 31:13.192
Matched a Dodge 1500.

31:13.194 --> 31:15.061
Turns out there are
only five Dodges

31:15.063 --> 31:16.662
with a permit to
launch at the pier.

31:16.664 --> 31:18.698
The wear patterns
on the treads

31:18.700 --> 31:20.266
matched the one that
belongs to Sheridan.

31:20.268 --> 31:22.101
Wow, we should give
this guy a job.

31:22.103 --> 31:23.436
Yeah, no thanks.

31:23.438 --> 31:26.472
After this is over with,
I'm going back to retirement.

31:26.474 --> 31:27.740
Well, you'll finish one for one.

31:27.742 --> 31:29.108
CSU found traces of blood

31:29.110 --> 31:30.543
on the blanket
onboard that boat.

31:30.545 --> 31:32.912
DNA matches Brooke's.

31:32.914 --> 31:34.180
I want to file a complaint.

31:34.182 --> 31:36.416
This crazy bastard assaulted me.

31:36.418 --> 31:37.650
I've been called worse.

31:37.652 --> 31:38.985
Listen to me.

31:38.987 --> 31:41.521
We found Brooke Waiakea's
blood on your boat, Richard.

31:41.523 --> 31:43.556
You're going away for murder,
you understand?

31:43.558 --> 31:46.225
I didn't kill anybody.
I was home all night.

31:46.227 --> 31:49.996
Somebody must've jacked
my rig, used my boat.

31:49.998 --> 31:51.798
Jacked your...? You're saying
someone stole your boat?

31:51.800 --> 31:52.832
That's what
you're going with?

31:52.834 --> 31:54.734
That's the truth, pal.
All right.

31:54.736 --> 31:56.636
I suppose you got somebody
to verify that alibi, too?

31:56.638 --> 31:57.737
I do. My wife.

31:57.739 --> 31:59.605
She was home with me all night.

31:59.607 --> 32:00.907
He's lying.

32:00.909 --> 32:02.875
Give me five minutes
with this son of a bitch.

32:04.546 --> 32:05.945
I'm done talking.

32:05.947 --> 32:08.414
I want my lawyer.

32:08.416 --> 32:10.750
All right, tell me we got
something on this guy.

32:10.752 --> 32:13.086
No connection to our victims,
no criminal record.

32:13.088 --> 32:15.421
He had some recent money
troubles, bad investments,

32:15.423 --> 32:16.923
but he seems to have
recovered from it.

32:16.925 --> 32:18.825
There's got to be something
connecting this guy

32:18.827 --> 32:20.493
to our victims
that we're not seeing.

32:20.495 --> 32:22.161
You know what?

32:22.163 --> 32:23.396
David Waring

32:23.398 --> 32:25.364
was a client of the
Manoa Hula company.

32:25.366 --> 32:26.933
All right?
Maybe Sheridan was, too.

32:26.935 --> 32:29.235
So, maybe he had
a thing for Brooke.

32:29.237 --> 32:31.003
Wasn't willing to share her.

32:31.005 --> 32:33.506
We got to get ahold
of Kiana Thompson's client list.

32:36.578 --> 32:38.144
<i>Look, Steve.</i>

32:38.146 --> 32:39.445
There is nothing
I would love more

32:39.447 --> 32:40.880
than to see
Kiana Thompson indicted,

32:40.882 --> 32:42.281
but she's got the
best defense attorneys

32:42.283 --> 32:43.483
in town covering her ass.

32:43.485 --> 32:44.485
I understand that.

32:44.486 --> 32:45.551
All I need
is her client list.

32:45.553 --> 32:46.786
Well, if it
was that easy,

32:46.788 --> 32:48.121
don't you think
I'd have it already?

32:48.123 --> 32:51.124
I have a feeling there are some
pretty powerful people on it

32:51.126 --> 32:52.692
that don't want their
names getting out.

32:52.694 --> 32:53.993
Okay, listen,

32:53.995 --> 32:56.996
Sheridan is a prime suspect
in two homicides, right?

32:56.998 --> 32:59.899
Brooke Waiakea was a dancer
at the Manoa Hula Company,

32:59.901 --> 33:01.434
and David Waring
was a client.

33:01.436 --> 33:04.303
That's got to be enough for a
judge to sign off on a warrant.

33:04.305 --> 33:06.405
Do you have proof
Waring was a client?

33:06.407 --> 33:08.474
Yeah, Kiana Thompson
gave us his name.

33:08.476 --> 33:11.077
And Brooke's roommate,
she verified their relationship.

33:11.079 --> 33:13.379
Well, I'm gonna need
cooperation from the roommate.

33:13.381 --> 33:16.349
You'll get it.

33:18.219 --> 33:19.819
Okay, wait here.
I'll call the judge.

33:19.821 --> 33:21.454
Mahalo.

33:24.292 --> 33:25.758
Chin.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.960
Steve, CSU found
a hair follicle on the blanket

33:27.962 --> 33:29.896
that was used to transport
Brooke's body.

33:29.898 --> 33:32.398
Now, crime lab analyzed it,
and based on its degradation,

33:32.400 --> 33:35.001
they think it was transferred
within the last 24 hours.

33:35.003 --> 33:36.802
It's a male, and it doesn't
belong to Sheridan.

33:36.804 --> 33:38.938
All right, we get
any hits in CODIS?

33:38.940 --> 33:40.273
No, but I'm guessing

33:40.275 --> 33:42.208
that Sheridan wasn't alone
on that boat last night.

33:42.210 --> 33:43.242
That's why he's not talking.

33:43.244 --> 33:46.479
He's protecting somebody.

33:46.481 --> 33:50.283
Whoever else was on that boat
is our killer.

34:03.877 --> 34:05.377
Gentlemen,
you can't go in there.

34:05.379 --> 34:06.778
Trust me, your boss knows
we're coming.

34:06.780 --> 34:08.146
I always loved
this part--

34:08.148 --> 34:09.447
dropping the
hammer on someone

34:09.449 --> 34:11.550
who thinks they got
away with murder.

34:11.552 --> 34:13.018
As we move
into the first quarter,

34:13.020 --> 34:15.420
my projections show
a 20 percent growth

34:15.422 --> 34:16.721
in the industry overall...

34:16.723 --> 34:18.723
I'm so
sorry, Mr. Young.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.425
I told them
you were in a meeting.

34:20.427 --> 34:21.760
It's okay, Stacy.

34:21.762 --> 34:23.094
Let's take half an hour.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.503
Gentlemen.

34:31.505 --> 34:32.637
Robert.

34:32.639 --> 34:34.139
That was a pretty impressive
little act

34:34.141 --> 34:35.340
at the tennis club earlier.

34:35.342 --> 34:37.375
I'm not sure I follow.

34:37.377 --> 34:40.045
You murdered Brooke Waiakea
and David Waring.

34:40.047 --> 34:42.013
What is he talking about?

34:42.014 --> 34:43.581
I'll tell you
what he's talking about.

34:43.583 --> 34:46.618
The Manoa Hula Company's client
list-- your name was on it.

34:46.620 --> 34:49.221
I hired them for
a corporate event.

34:49.223 --> 34:51.255
Tell me something,
when did you find out

34:51.257 --> 34:53.891
that David Waring's name was
also on the same client list?

34:53.893 --> 34:56.360
'Cause I'm thinking it must have
been pretty recently.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.330
Because there's no way you would
have let your daughter marry him

34:58.332 --> 34:59.998
once you knew
what he was up to, right?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.800
Is that why you went

35:01.802 --> 35:04.069
to his place last night?
To confront him?

35:04.071 --> 35:06.238
There's nothing worse
than a hypocrite.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.673
Sure, it's all right
for you to cheat.

35:08.675 --> 35:12.477
But not the man who's gonna
marry your precious little girl.

35:12.479 --> 35:14.513
It is over,
you scumbag.

35:14.515 --> 35:16.081
You are gonna call Erica,

35:16.083 --> 35:17.824
and you are gonna break
it off or I will!

35:17.848 --> 35:18.751
Go ahead.

35:18.752 --> 35:20.619
And I'll tell your wife
and daughter how you're

35:20.621 --> 35:23.522
an even bigger scumbag
than I am.

35:23.524 --> 35:26.024
Get the hell out of here!

35:34.868 --> 35:36.735
Good luck proving any of this.

35:36.737 --> 35:38.470
Luck's got nothing
to do with it.

35:38.472 --> 35:40.505
Yeah, he's right.
We got some DNA off the blanket

35:40.507 --> 35:41.973
that was used
to wrap up Brooke.

35:41.975 --> 35:44.042
My guess is it's gonna be
a match to you.

35:44.044 --> 35:45.310
Not that we needed it.

35:45.312 --> 35:47.178
The moment we told Sheridan

35:47.180 --> 35:49.180
that we knew you were involved,
he spilled.

35:49.182 --> 35:51.516
Told us that you guys were
friends since elementary school.

35:51.518 --> 35:53.218
He told us about
you bailing him out

35:53.220 --> 35:54.819
of the recent financial
problems he had.

35:54.821 --> 35:58.223
He also told us that when you
called him to borrow his boat,

35:58.225 --> 35:59.791
he felt obligated.

35:59.793 --> 36:03.128
You almost
got away with murder.

36:03.130 --> 36:05.297
But you didn't know Brooke was
still there, did you?

36:09.903 --> 36:12.837
Eh, it's all right, I mean,
we got a pretty good idea

36:12.839 --> 36:14.406
who tipped you off about her.

36:17.411 --> 36:19.277
If you still have
any humanity left in you,

36:19.279 --> 36:21.546
do yourself a favor
and tell us.

36:28.722 --> 36:31.189
That's what we used
to call "incentive."

36:36.463 --> 36:38.563
I would give him a name
if I was you.

36:47.374 --> 36:50.141
Hi. You, uh,
headed out?

36:50.143 --> 36:51.443
Yeah, I'm headed
to a venue.

36:51.445 --> 36:53.378
Oh, I don't think
you're gonna make it.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.713
Kiana Thompson,
you're under arrest.

36:54.715 --> 36:56.081
For what?

36:56.083 --> 36:57.849
What, your office couldn't
make a case against me,

36:57.851 --> 37:00.385
so you bring your bulldogs
down here to try and scare me?

37:00.387 --> 37:02.787
Actually, it's got nothing
to do with our case.

37:02.789 --> 37:05.357
Yeah, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

37:05.359 --> 37:08.526
I just wanted to be here
to see you get taken away.

37:08.528 --> 37:11.029
Now, you see, when Brooke
witnessed David Waring's murder,

37:11.031 --> 37:12.330
she went home, and
she called you.

37:12.332 --> 37:14.966
You told her you were
gonna protect her,

37:14.968 --> 37:16.868
take care of everything.

37:16.870 --> 37:18.770
But then you called
Robert Young instead.

37:18.772 --> 37:21.072
I mean, I
get it, you know.

37:21.074 --> 37:24.409
Brooke wasn't worth losing
two clients in one night.

37:26.213 --> 37:28.680
She didn't have the heart
for this work.

37:28.682 --> 37:30.382
She was never gonna last.

37:32.986 --> 37:34.219
Come on.

37:38.925 --> 37:40.558
Thank you.

40:30.230 --> 40:32.230
Hey, Jer,
what are you doing?

40:32.232 --> 40:33.998
Hey, Chin, I
got the job.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.534
Well, not <i> the</i> job,
I got <i> a</i> job.

40:36.536 --> 40:38.236
I'm in advertising now.

40:38.238 --> 40:39.804
Seems like you got
a real knack for it.

40:39.806 --> 40:41.606
I know. It's kind of
like I was born

40:41.608 --> 40:43.608
with this preternatural ability
I never knew I had.

40:43.610 --> 40:45.243
Hmm.

40:45.245 --> 40:47.812
So I guess the programming gig
didn't work out, huh?

40:47.814 --> 40:50.481
Apparently, they never heard of
your import/export business.

40:50.483 --> 40:52.984
And since you were my only
reference, they decided to pass.

40:52.986 --> 40:54.085
What?!

40:54.087 --> 40:56.588
And my company was
so successful, too.

40:56.590 --> 40:59.023
The upshot is Kamekona's
paying me off the books,

40:59.025 --> 41:00.425
which is good
because, you know,

41:00.427 --> 41:03.027
me and the old IRS don't
exactly see eye-to-eye.

41:03.029 --> 41:05.096
Plus the hours aren't bad,
and I get 20% off.

41:05.098 --> 41:06.431
Employee perk.

41:06.433 --> 41:09.200
Jer, you realize you just
admitted to tax evasion, right?

41:09.202 --> 41:11.202
Oh.

41:11.204 --> 41:13.872
Well, I guess I could quit.

41:13.874 --> 41:15.607
But then I'd probably
have to be moving

41:15.609 --> 41:17.809
into your place
permanently.

41:19.579 --> 41:21.045
You know what,
why don't you, uh,

41:21.047 --> 41:23.514
just bring us home a couple
plates of coconut shrimp, huh?

41:23.516 --> 41:24.549
You got it.

41:24.551 --> 41:26.384
Oh, and it's on me.
No, no, no, no.

41:26.386 --> 41:28.686
Save your money. I got this one.

41:45.472 --> 41:47.639
Hey.

41:49.242 --> 41:50.441
How's Brooke's
father doing?

41:50.443 --> 41:51.910
He lost his
little girl.

41:51.912 --> 41:53.144
He's a mess.

41:53.146 --> 41:55.780
I'm gonna to head with
him back to Lana'i.

41:55.782 --> 41:58.983
Bring Brooke back home
where she belongs.

42:01.187 --> 42:04.522
Listen, Harry,
this is, uh...

42:04.524 --> 42:07.058
You can't blame yourself
for this one.

42:07.060 --> 42:09.661
Sure, I can.

42:09.663 --> 42:12.897
Men like us, we were born
to protect and serve.

42:12.899 --> 42:14.766
When somebody dies
that we could've saved,

42:14.768 --> 42:16.601
I mean, that doesn't go away.

42:18.438 --> 42:20.939
Yeah.

42:20.941 --> 42:23.574
Listen, I can't thank you enough
for your help on this.

42:23.576 --> 42:25.944
I mean it, Harry, I mean,
if it wasn't for you,

42:25.946 --> 42:27.745
there's, uh... there's no way
we would've solved it.

42:27.747 --> 42:30.381
I appreciate you saying so.

42:30.383 --> 42:33.084
You know, all this
modern technology--

42:33.086 --> 42:34.619
it's really
not my thing.

42:34.621 --> 42:36.988
Hey, you could take all
the modern technology you want,

42:36.990 --> 42:38.389
it's never gonna replace
a gut instinct

42:38.391 --> 42:40.191
and good old-fashioned
police work.

42:40.193 --> 42:42.433
Well, it's good to know that's
not gonna go out of style.

42:43.396 --> 42:45.330
You're a good cop, kid.

42:45.332 --> 42:47.298
You remind me a lot of myself.

42:49.936 --> 42:51.336
Aloha, Steve.

42:51.338 --> 42:53.671
Aloha, Harry.

43:02.682 --> 43:04.782
<i>No matter what they tell you,</i>
